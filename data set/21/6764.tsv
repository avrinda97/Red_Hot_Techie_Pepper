2007-02-01T11:59:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	jracicot	rythymbox (included) or banshee (universe)
2007-02-01T12:00:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	jracicot	i recomend banshee
2007-02-01T12:00:00.000Z	jracicot	ConstyXIV	 i just tried rythymbox but none of the files would play, i would click on them to play but the songs just cycle through giving an error each time one tries to play
2007-02-01T12:01:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	jracicot	have you installed mp3 coedecs yet?
2007-02-01T12:01:00.000Z	jracicot	ConstyXIV	i dont think so, how do i do that?
2007-02-01T12:02:00.000Z	jracicot	ConstyXIV	i type that in the terminal?
2007-02-01T12:02:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	jracicot	yes

2007-02-01T12:02:00.000Z	jracicot	ConstyXIV	k, one sec
2007-02-01T12:04:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	jracicot	you just type !foo, with foo being what you want to know
2007-02-01T12:05:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	jracicot	you dont need to pipe ubotu to yourself unless you like the warm fuzzy feeling
2007-02-01T12:07:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	jracicot	ubotu is the name of a bot, an other people just sound like bots sometimes
2007-02-01T12:11:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	jracicot	have you actually copied them over or just hit play?
2007-02-01T12:11:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	jracicot	do they show up in music library, then probably yes
2007-02-01T12:12:00.000Z	jracicot	ConstyXIV	for some reason 106 showed up in the music library but the rest stayed on the ipod
2007-02-01T12:14:00.000Z	jracicot	ConstyXIV	and it says i need to install the right plugins to play the files, where do i get those?
