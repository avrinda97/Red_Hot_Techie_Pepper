2005-07-08T16:36:00.000Z	tiglionabbit		hey dudes
2005-07-08T16:36:00.000Z	tiglionabbit		a friend of mine has a binary that is compiled "for red hat 9".  Do you think it will run on Fedora?  or Ubuntu even?  Just curious
2005-07-08T16:37:00.000Z	concept10	tiglionabbit	try to find a new binary, it may not work because of that, you can try alien
2005-07-08T16:38:00.000Z	concept10	tiglionabbit	what is it?
2005-07-08T16:41:00.000Z	concept10	tiglionabbit	use alien
2005-07-08T16:43:00.000Z	concept10	tiglionabbit	you have many options, you can make a rpm convert with alien, make a deb, try the binary, recompile on your system, etc
2005-07-08T16:43:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	concept10	I said it wasn't open source, and not available as an rpm
2005-07-08T16:44:00.000Z	concept10	tiglionabbit	you can turn a binary to a rpm, open source or not, but just try and run it
2005-07-15T10:01:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	concept10	it should do that automatically
2005-07-15T10:02:00.000Z	concept10	tiglionabbit	it doesnt
2005-07-15T10:02:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	concept10	does for me...
2005-07-15T10:03:00.000Z	concept10	tiglionabbit	for example.. the panel crashed a min ago and all the icons got switched around
2005-07-15T10:03:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	concept10	perhaps if you had a normal shutdown, rather than crashing it, it would be happier
2005-07-15T10:04:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	concept10	I mean a normal logout...
2005-07-15T10:04:00.000Z	concept10	tiglionabbit	 nevermind... you dont understand
2005-07-22T16:23:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	concept10	vim has a history.  It's based on the oldest text editor in the world
2005-07-22T16:23:00.000Z	concept10	tiglionabbit	negative
2005-07-22T16:25:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	concept10	I meant the oldest text editor for a computer
2005-07-22T16:25:00.000Z	concept10	tiglionabbit	:) :)
2005-07-22T16:26:00.000Z	concept10	tiglionabbit	a little humor, thats all.
