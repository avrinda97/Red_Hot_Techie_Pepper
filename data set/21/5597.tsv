2007-11-07T04:21:00.000Z	Prez		hello
2007-11-07T04:22:00.000Z	Prez		someone else having issues with OOo crashing all the time?  I try to format number on cell in spreadsheet, bam, crash... most ppts are crashing OOo too... is this a reported thing or just me?
2007-11-07T04:23:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	Prez	known issue, it sucks
2007-11-07T04:23:00.000Z	Prez	Shapeshifter	wow, i cannot get any work done..
2007-11-07T04:23:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	Prez	It's reported as critical. uninstall the openoffice-gtk package and it will work
2007-11-07T04:23:00.000Z	Prez	Shapeshifter	thanks
2007-11-07T04:23:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	Prez	It will look ugly as hell, but it will work.
2007-11-07T04:24:00.000Z	Prez	Shapeshifter	I'll take ugly over unstable..
2007-11-07T04:29:00.000Z	Prez	Shapeshifter	if I uninstall openoffice-gtk it will remove openoffice-gnome, is that ok?
2007-11-07T04:29:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	Prez	yes, but wait a minute i'll doublecheck
2007-11-07T04:29:00.000Z	Prez	Shapeshifter	thanks
2007-11-07T04:30:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	Prez	yes, both packages, openoffice.org-gtk and -gnome. that's good. be sure to have OO closed while doing this ;)
2007-11-07T04:40:00.000Z	Prez	Shapeshifter	that solution rocked, I can work now, thanks
2007-11-07T04:41:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	Prez	yeah, it looks shitty though ^^ I hope they'll fix that soon....
2007-11-07T04:54:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	Prez	Add compiz --fusion to your session
2007-11-07T04:54:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	Prez	(System/Preferences/Sessions)
2007-11-07T04:56:00.000Z	Prez	Shapeshifter	so the startup program should be compiz, it's checked and command line should be "compiz --fusion" ?
2007-11-07T04:56:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	Prez	or better add " compiz --replace -c emerald" ^^
2007-11-07T04:57:00.000Z	Prez	Shapeshifter	I had that, compiz was checked as startup with command line "compiz --replace -c emerald" and nothing, I had to run it manually
2007-11-07T04:58:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	Prez	Mh, I had that too sometime ago. Now I don't even have to have it ticked. ^^ you could try reinstalling compiz (your configs will not get lost) or you can try and ask at #compiz-fusion
2007-11-07T04:58:00.000Z	Prez	Shapeshifter	will do, thanks again
