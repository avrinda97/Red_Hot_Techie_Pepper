2008-01-08T17:09:00.000Z	LeShnoz		Hey guys I still dont have permission on my HDD. Anybody know why? My Fstab has this line: /dev/sda2 reiserfs defaults,gid=46,umask=007 0 0
2008-01-08T17:09:00.000Z	ikonia	LeShnoz	define don't have permissions
2008-01-08T17:09:00.000Z	ikonia	LeShnoz	what are you trying to do
2008-01-08T17:10:00.000Z	ikonia	LeShnoz	ok - and what ar eyou doing that gets no permission
2008-01-08T17:10:00.000Z	ikonia	LeShnoz	so what are the permssions on the directory you are trying to copy to
2008-01-08T17:11:00.000Z	ikonia	LeShnoz	look ?
2008-01-08T17:12:00.000Z	ikonia	LeShnoz	what is the path you are trying to copy to
2008-01-08T17:13:00.000Z	ikonia	LeShnoz	ok so in nautilus what do the properties say the permissions or, or what does "ls -la /media/PartitionSDA2" show
2008-01-08T17:15:00.000Z	ikonia	LeShnoz	ok - so root owns that permissions, so you either have to change the permissions to be owned by you, OR make it world writeable, OR use sudo/gksudo to copy the files, which approach would you like to take
2008-01-08T17:17:00.000Z	ikonia	LeShnoz	ok - so you need to either a.) use gksudo and change the permissions to write for everyone b.) sudo chmod 777 media/PartitionSDA2
2008-01-08T17:18:00.000Z	LeShnoz	ikonia	thanks a lot. How do I do a.)? gksudo ______ ?
2008-01-08T17:18:00.000Z	ikonia	LeShnoz	gksudo nautilus
2008-01-08T17:19:00.000Z	LeShnoz	ikonia	thank you so much : )
2008-01-08T17:20:00.000Z	ikonia	LeShnoz	welcome
2008-01-08T17:20:00.000Z	LeShnoz	ikonia	so if I wanted multiple specific users (me and my vbox) i'd make a group and give the group permission / add members to it?
2008-01-08T17:21:00.000Z	ikonia	LeShnoz	thats an excellent approach
2008-01-08T17:23:00.000Z	LeShnoz	ikonia	> one more thing. How do I make the changes stick? Logoff?
2008-01-08T17:23:00.000Z	ikonia	LeShnoz	what changes do you mean ?
2008-01-08T17:28:00.000Z	LeShnoz	ikonia	> changing the permissions via root terminal doesnt seem to hold. "File access" reverts to "---". I assume if I made File Access Read/Write for Others I would be able to write to the disk?
2008-01-08T17:28:00.000Z	ikonia	LeShnoz	correct
2008-01-08T17:31:00.000Z	LeShnoz	ikonia	> I just did the chmod instead. I wonder whats wrong though? (I wanted to go through ubuntus interface)
