2011-09-25T13:41:00.000Z	alexfpms		HI all, my laptop can connect easily to some wireless networks and cannot connect to others (all WPA)... anyone can help please?
2011-09-25T13:43:00.000Z	benoliver999	alexfpms	Might be a channel problem. Type sudo iwlist scan
2011-09-25T13:43:00.000Z	benoliver999		Are the networks you want listed there?
2011-09-25T13:45:00.000Z	benoliver999		antiphysics: USB is about it I'm afraid - you need something independant from the main hardware.
2011-09-25T13:45:00.000Z	alexfpms	benoliver999	yup
2011-09-25T13:45:00.000Z	alexfpms	benoliver999	btw I have another laptop connected to that network now (From wich i'm talking)
2011-09-25T13:46:00.000Z	benoliver999	alexfpms	Then you might have to go into the router settings and change the channel. That command I just gave you also gives the channel.
2011-09-25T13:47:00.000Z	benoliver999	alexfpms	I can't guarantee it's the solution, but it's worked for me in the past - my family got online OK, mine dd not. Changed the router channel an hey presto.
2011-09-25T13:47:00.000Z	alexfpms	benoliver999	It's a shared network, I've no access to the settings :(
2011-09-25T13:48:00.000Z	benoliver999	alexfpms	That sucks. Tell which SSID you want to connect to then paste the output of sudo iwlist scan
2011-09-25T13:49:00.000Z	benoliver999	alexfpms	Sorry for all the typos, crap wireless keyboard.
2011-09-25T13:49:00.000Z	alexfpms		np :)

2011-09-25T13:54:00.000Z	benoliver999	alexfpms	I just don't see it I'm afraid, can't help thinking it's a channel issue. Especially since you can connect to others.
2011-09-25T13:55:00.000Z	alexfpms	benoliver999	do you have any idea how to reset all network settings? I already tried to remove network manager and reinstall it, but he keeps all settings...
2011-09-25T13:57:00.000Z	benoliver999	alexfpms	it'll be in a config file somwhere I guess. Have you tried wicd?
2011-09-25T13:57:00.000Z	benoliver999	alexfpms	sometime that works for people.
2011-09-25T13:58:00.000Z	alexfpms		yup, I always use wicd, but when I started having troubles, I moved back to network manager
2011-09-25T13:58:00.000Z	alexfpms	benoliver999	yup, I always use wicd, but when I started having troubles, I moved back to network manager
2011-09-25T13:59:00.000Z	benoliver999	alexfpms	then I'm all out of ideas I'm afraid. You can remove individual networks from network-manager in the 'edit connections' dialog.
2011-09-25T14:00:00.000Z	alexfpms	benoliver999	I already tried that... thanks anyway for your time :)
