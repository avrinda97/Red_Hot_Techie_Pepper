2008-11-13T17:37:00.000Z	divine_		hi. ubuntu 8.10 does not allow dvd drive to be used, ubuntu has set the permissions so that no normal user has access, how can i fix this?
2008-11-13T17:37:00.000Z	divine_		this is in my /etc/fstab: /dev/scd0       /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 user,noauto,exec,utf8 0       0
2008-11-13T17:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	divine_	mines identical
2008-11-13T17:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	divine_	when you say access, do you mean read or write or both
2008-11-13T17:39:00.000Z	divine_	ActionParsnip	write access, currently the permissions are: drwxr-xr-x 3  501 dialout  592 2008-08-29 09:54 cdrom0  -- and i cant use chmod on that dir, it should be in /etc/fstab
2008-11-13T17:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	divine_	you cant write to a cd like that, you need an app
2008-11-13T17:41:00.000Z	divine_	ActionParsnip	actually, i just wanna run Installer.exe with wine, but i think it fails over permissions, "dialout" is the group owner and non-existing user 501 is the owner of the cdrom; thats doesnt seem right
2008-11-13T17:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	divine_	with drwxr-xr-x everybody can execute
2008-11-13T17:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	divine_	add yourself to the group "dialou"
2008-11-13T17:48:00.000Z	divine_	ActionParsnip	think i know the problem, this is the permission on the files on the cdrom: drwx------ 2 501 dialout     492 2008-08-29 09:54 DirectX
2008-11-13T17:49:00.000Z	divine_	ActionParsnip	so it denies everyone access because user 501 does not exist. where does ubuntu get this info from? where?
2008-11-13T17:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	divine_	then you're stuck as its a ROM (read only memory)
2008-11-13T17:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	divine_	depends wherre it was burned
2008-11-13T17:50:00.000Z	divine_	ActionParsnip	the permissions are NOT on CD/DVD! Ubuntu does that, not the dvd
2008-11-13T17:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	divine_	yep, ubuntu will do that if you selected biurn for Linux only afaik
2008-11-13T17:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	divine_	i'd make the group then add your user to it
2008-11-13T17:52:00.000Z	divine_	ActionParsnip	well this is an official dvd for World of Warcraft. i should convince ubuntu to mount it as my normal user with proper permissions, probably in /etc/fstab as parsed option
2008-11-13T17:52:00.000Z	divine_	ActionParsnip	only user gets permissions, not even the group (zero permisions on the files). ill search a bit tho. seems this is a common problem for ubuntu.
2008-11-13T17:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	divine_	you could copy to your HDD then chown / chmod
2008-11-13T17:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	divine_	then rm when its installed
2008-11-13T17:55:00.000Z	divine_	ActionParsnip	yeah doing that now. just hoped it worked like it should ;(
