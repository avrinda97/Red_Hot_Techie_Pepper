2006-03-02T17:05:00.000Z	joosep		what is an art manager, thegladiator
2006-03-02T17:05:00.000Z	thegladiator	joosep	some of the themes in my system work properly only after a X estart
2006-03-02T17:06:00.000Z	thegladiator	joosep	art manager is a theme utility , you can download stuffs...i dont kow whats causing ur problem. fresh install ?
2006-03-02T17:06:00.000Z	joosep		i have restarted X and still none of them work. they work in the preview mode though thegladiator
2006-03-02T17:06:00.000Z	joosep		switch gives that error when i press apply : Gtk-CRITICAL **: file gtkentry.c: line 440 (gtk_entry_set_text): assertion `text != NULL' failed.
2006-03-02T17:06:00.000Z	thegladiator		i had such problems after I installed artmanager .
2006-03-02T17:06:00.000Z	thegladiator		fresh instal ? joosep ?
2006-03-02T17:07:00.000Z	joosep	thegladiator	what do you mean? it is not a fresh install
2006-03-02T17:07:00.000Z	joosep	thegladiator	and i don't intend to do a fresh install until dapper is released
2006-03-02T17:08:00.000Z	thegladiator	joosep	maybe you tweaked something and that csued the problem ? I had the same problem after I installed art manager , some themes work though
2006-03-02T17:08:00.000Z	thegladiator		yes I am also waiting till dapper ..till then I dont care about themes
2006-03-02T17:08:00.000Z	thegladiator		sicne in the present system it seems to be not worling well
2006-03-02T17:08:00.000Z	joosep		well, i'd really like to get gtk1 application to look nicer
2006-03-02T17:08:00.000Z	joosep		the fonts are plain horrible
2006-03-02T17:09:00.000Z	thegladiator	joosep	fonts can be changed
2006-03-02T17:09:00.000Z	thegladiator	joosep	system -> prefernce -> fonts
