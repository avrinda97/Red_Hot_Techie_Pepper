2009-11-24T12:17:00.000Z	musty_	maco	Yeah, I just don't see it in my nm-applet.
2009-11-24T12:14:00.000Z	maco	musty_	itll probably vary by hardware. my intel is dandy, but my roommate's atheros was really slow til he installed linux-backports-modules
2009-11-24T12:15:00.000Z	maco	musty_	check system -> administration -> hardware drivers
2009-11-24T12:15:00.000Z	maco	musty_	sounds like you dont have the driver installed
2009-11-24T12:15:00.000Z	musty_	maco	It says there are none.
2009-11-24T12:16:00.000Z	maco	musty_	can you put the output of "dpkg -l bcmwl*" on paste.ubuntu.com?
2009-11-24T12:16:00.000Z	maco	musty_	you said broadcom right?
2009-11-24T12:16:00.000Z	musty_	maco	blah blah blah: bcmwl-modalias 5.10.91.9+bdco Modaliases for the Broadcom 802.11 Linux STA
2009-11-24T12:17:00.000Z	maco	musty_	ok so it says its insalled
2009-11-24T12:17:00.000Z	maco	musty_	just try "sudo aptitude reinstall bcmwl-modaliases bcmwl-kernel-source"
2009-11-24T12:18:00.000Z	maco	musty_	the driver apparently doesnt get rebuilt if you install updates and the driver without rebooting in between
2009-11-24T12:18:00.000Z	musty_	maco	Ah, I need an ethernet connect on that laptop, only have wireless inet.
2009-11-24T12:18:00.000Z	maco	musty_	ok actually
2009-11-24T12:18:00.000Z	maco	musty_	no need
2009-11-24T12:19:00.000Z	maco	musty_	use "sudo dpkg-reconfigure bcmwl-modaliases bcmwl-kernel-source" and im told that should work too
2009-11-24T12:19:00.000Z	maco	musty_	i *know* reinstall works. one of the other devs said dpkg-reconfigure should work too though when i was talking to him about it
2009-11-24T12:20:00.000Z	maco	musty_	oh. alright well when you get online, get that installed too
2009-11-24T12:20:00.000Z	musty_	maco	will do; I'll come back later and find you -- thanks.
2009-11-24T12:20:00.000Z	maco	musty_	ill likely be asleep later...its about 230am here
2009-11-24T12:20:00.000Z	musty_	maco	Eh, its 8:20am here.
2009-11-24T12:21:00.000Z	musty_	maco	well, whatever the case is, I'll find you.
