2010-07-13T20:43:00.000Z	sno	visvanath	that command creates the file in the current directory, you probably need to mv it to /etc/X11/xorg.conf (the name is different too)
2010-07-13T20:44:00.000Z	visvanath	sno	what will be the default "current dir" on a root terminal ??? i.e i did not isue a cd
2010-07-13T20:44:00.000Z	sno	visvanath	pwd will tell you
2010-07-13T20:44:00.000Z	visvanath	sno	I am not on a root terminal now
2010-07-13T20:45:00.000Z	visvanath	sno	do you understand what my question is ? :(
2010-07-13T20:46:00.000Z	sno	visvanath	yes but im not sure you understand my answer, re-run the command to create the blank xorg.conf then type "pwd" to show you where you are , then mv that file to the correct place
2010-07-13T21:05:00.000Z	visvanath	sno	ok
2010-07-13T21:17:00.000Z	visvanath	sno	are you still there ?
2010-07-13T21:17:00.000Z	visvanath	sno	pwd howed "/root"
2010-07-13T21:17:00.000Z	visvanath	sno	so now, where is /root ?
2010-07-13T21:18:00.000Z	visvanath	sno	are you there ?
2010-07-13T21:19:00.000Z	visvanath	sno	I opened it
2010-07-13T21:19:00.000Z	visvanath	sno	and i has xorg.conf.new
2010-07-13T21:19:00.000Z	visvanath	sno	what must i do now ?
2010-07-13T21:19:00.000Z	visvanath	sno	move it to etc /x11, If i move by renaming it xorg.conf . how do i make the ubuntu use that xorg.conf ?
2010-07-13T21:23:00.000Z	sno	visvanath	it knows to use the file if you save it in /etc/X11/ as xorg.conf then restart X/your display manager.
2010-07-13T21:24:00.000Z	visvanath	sno	you mean i have to move it and then restart or logout/login ?
2010-07-13T21:25:00.000Z	sno	visvanath	login/out is fine, but if your X is already running/working im not sure what the point of creating an xorg.conf is
2010-07-13T21:29:00.000Z	visvanath	sno	I editted and paste dmy xorg.conf onto /etc/x11
