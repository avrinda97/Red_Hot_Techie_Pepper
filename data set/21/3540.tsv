2008-11-30T10:17:00.000Z	mesh11		I just installed ubuntu 8.10, but kept my /home folder from 8.04, I deleted my /home/user/. directories. I can no longer see an icon for wireless networks. I created a new user and can see it there. How do I get it back for my current user?
2008-11-30T10:19:00.000Z	rww	mesh11	System > Preferences > Sessions, then "Startup Programs" tab. There should be an entry for Network Manager. Check the box by it. If the entry isn't there, let me know and I'll walk you through adding it.
2008-11-30T10:20:00.000Z	mesh11	rww	network manager has a check in it already
2008-11-30T10:20:00.000Z	rww	mesh11	but it's not loading up? hmm. Select it, then hit Edit, and paste the contents of the "Command" field here.
2008-11-30T10:22:00.000Z	mesh11	rww	nm-applet --sm-disable
2008-11-30T10:23:00.000Z	rww	mesh11	hmm. and it's still not running? that's odd...
2008-11-30T10:24:00.000Z	mesh11	rww	looking at ps, there is no program called nm-applet running, but I can see my wireless connections in my newly created user account
2008-11-30T10:24:00.000Z	rww	mesh11	ps or ps -A?
2008-11-30T10:24:00.000Z	mesh11	rww	ps -aux
2008-11-30T10:25:00.000Z	mesh11	rww	ah, tried running from the command line, I get this error: WARNING **: <WARN>  applet_dbus_manager_start_service(): Could not acquire the NetworkManagerUserSettings service as it is already taken.  Return: 3
2008-11-30T10:26:00.000Z	rww	mesh11	okay. So on the user account you grabbed from hardy, you see Network Manager in Sessions, and it's checked, but isn't running?
2008-11-30T10:28:00.000Z	mesh11	rww	that is correct
2008-11-30T10:29:00.000Z	rww	mesh11	maybe try only logging into one user at a time? it might be complicating things...
2008-11-30T10:29:00.000Z	mesh11	rww	yeah, the reason I created the other user was because I couldn't find a way to connect to my wireless network from this account
2008-11-30T10:30:00.000Z	rww	mesh11	oh, yeah, huh, it'll disconnect you.
2008-11-30T10:30:00.000Z	rww	mesh11	okays, give me a second to think about it
2008-11-30T10:33:00.000Z	mesh11	rww	okay thanks
2008-11-30T10:36:00.000Z	rww	mesh11	okay. Try logging out of both your users, then logging into the broken one. If the applet doesn't show up, issue nm-applet from the terminal and see if it shows up. If it still doesn't show up, do sudo /etc/init.d/NetworkManager stop then sudo /etc/init.d/NetworkManager start from the terminal. If it /still/ doesn't work, give up, log into your working user, and install wicd because I'm out of ideas.
2008-11-30T10:38:00.000Z	rww	mesh11	(wicd is, for me at least, incredibly less annoying than NM :) )
2008-11-30T10:38:00.000Z	mesh11	rww	thanks, will give it a try, should I also issue --sm-disable with the nm-applet command?
2008-11-30T10:39:00.000Z	rww	mesh11	doesn't matter
