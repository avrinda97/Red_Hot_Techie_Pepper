2007-04-27T16:26:00.000Z	Woody_		ah
2007-04-27T16:26:00.000Z	Woody_		okay
2007-04-27T16:26:00.000Z	Woody_		thanks IndyGunFreak
2007-04-27T16:27:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Woody_	what do you want to do with your distro?
2007-04-27T16:24:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Woody_	differences are way to many, it'd take a 2hr discussion.
2007-04-27T16:25:00.000Z	Woody_	IndyGunFreak	what makes Ubuntu better than Fedora (if thats true) and do you think i should try FC?
2007-04-27T16:25:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Woody_	I like Fedora, its my second favorite to Ubuntu... Only reason why I prefer Ubuntu to Fedora, is I think Ubuntu's package manager(apt-get), is superior to Fedora's.(yum)
2007-04-27T16:27:00.000Z	Woody_	IndyGunFreak	im new to the Linux OS after getting mad from Vista.... so im using Ubuntu now. its nice
2007-04-27T16:28:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Woody_	well there's obviously a reason you wanted to consider Fedora, so whats the issue?
2007-04-27T16:29:00.000Z	Woody_	IndyGunFreak	i was having a discussion with a friend who said that Fedora is better than Ubuntu. I told him okay, but really i had no idea about what Fedora is all about. so i came here to ask whats the difference :)
2007-04-27T16:29:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Woody_	to me, 6 on one hand, half dozen on the other, both very good distros,
2007-04-27T16:30:00.000Z	Woody_	IndyGunFreak	aha, is Fedora easy to use?
2007-04-27T16:30:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Woody_	its not hard once you get the hang of it, just like Ubuntu... its learning curve is about the same as Ubuntu's, in my opinion.
2007-04-27T16:30:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Woody_	what version of Ubuntu are you using
2007-04-27T16:31:00.000Z	Woody_	IndyGunFreak	im using 7.04 Fiesty
2007-04-27T16:32:00.000Z	Woody_	IndyGunFreak	im having some problems with the KACPID process, its eating about 90% of my CPU.... so i disabled it and working with a high-risk
2007-04-27T16:33:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Woody_	kacpid?
2007-04-27T16:33:00.000Z	Woody_	IndyGunFreak	its a process for controlling the temperature and the RPM's of the fans for the CPU
2007-04-27T16:33:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Woody_	no clue on that one.. sorry.
