2008-08-22T17:46:00.000Z	ifireball	arvind_khadri	I stumbled upon this problem as well, is seems the way USB is done has changed in hardy and HP havn't updated their drivers accordingly
2008-08-22T17:46:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	ifireball	oh ok... so do we mark a bug?
2008-08-22T17:47:00.000Z	ifireball	arvind_khadri	printing works because sane is ably to use the HAL backend rather then the HP one
2008-08-22T17:47:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	ifireball	oh ... the scan button on the printer doesnt do anything
2008-08-22T17:47:00.000Z	ifireball	arvind_khadri	there is already such a bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/hplip/+bug/181242
2008-08-22T17:49:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	ifireball	oh ... Hp should be contacted... scanning works through xsane
2008-08-22T17:49:00.000Z	ifireball	arvind_khadri	oh? you have it working with Xsane? it doesn't detect my scanner
2008-08-22T17:50:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	ifireball	i think i somehow did it...but the scan button doesnt work... and HP should provide drivers for us in there CD's
2008-08-22T17:51:00.000Z	ifireball	arvind_khadri	can you tell me how? it may stir me in the right direction, so far I havn't been able to find any way to manually configure sane
2008-08-22T17:52:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	ifireball	i read the community doc... wait a sec i'll give you that :)
2008-08-22T17:52:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	ifireball	i followed the help.ubuntu
2008-08-22T17:53:00.000Z	ifireball	arvind_khadri	well, been to all those places already, thx anyway.
2008-08-22T17:53:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	ifireball	hmm :)
2008-08-22T17:55:00.000Z	ifireball	arvind_khadri	the main problem it that there are things that worked in Feisty/Gutsy (an so appear in the table) but do not in Hardy
2008-08-22T17:56:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	ifireball	hmm can happen... the libs keep changing but not the drivers...
2008-08-22T17:57:00.000Z	ifireball	arvind_khadri	indeed, have you noticed that "lspci" doe not work as well nowdays?
2008-08-22T17:57:00.000Z	ifireball	arvind_khadri	I mean "lsusb"
2008-08-22T17:58:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	ifireball	oh yeah.... actually lsub shows a different port id than what hp-setup says
2008-08-22T17:59:00.000Z	ifireball	arvind_khadri	well, at least it show _anything_ on your end, here, it just returns nothing (although one can see usb devices in /sys)
2008-08-22T18:00:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	ifireball	oh ...
