2010-02-11T06:11:00.000Z	phong_		guys if u dont mind to asnwer question: is ubuntu better then mac os x?
2010-02-11T06:11:00.000Z	phong_		in what way?
2010-02-11T06:11:00.000Z	phong_		i know ubuntu is free
2010-02-11T06:11:00.000Z	phong_		;)
2010-02-11T06:12:00.000Z	elijah	phong_	I will tell you one way. You can resize the bloody windows in Ubuntu from any side, in Mac you are FORCED to use the bottom right of the windows to resize. OS X forces you to do a lot of things its way.
2010-02-11T06:13:00.000Z	elijah	phong_	Also you can't install OS X on anything other than Apple Hardware, not even Windows is that bad.
2010-02-11T06:13:00.000Z	elijah	phong_	Apple is about TOTAL control, freedom really isn't anywhere in there business plan
2010-02-11T06:14:00.000Z	elijah	phong_	Although I think you should learn it though, and Ubuntu
2010-02-11T06:14:00.000Z	elijah	phong_	Yeah, a lot of it is starting to mature now.
2010-02-11T06:15:00.000Z	elijah	phong_	GNU/Linux is the future, you would do yourself good to start learning it now.
2010-02-11T06:15:00.000Z	elijah	phong_	The majority of Linux software is free, yes.
2010-02-11T06:16:00.000Z	elijah	phong_	stay away from 64bit for now unless you know what you are doing
2010-02-11T06:16:00.000Z	elijah	phong_	start with 32bit
2010-02-11T06:18:00.000Z	elijah	phong_	You may wish to install through Windows the first time. It is easier that way.
2010-02-11T06:19:00.000Z	elijah	phong_	Then just burn the image and do the live CD as suggested
2010-02-11T06:20:00.000Z	elijah	phong_	A MAC is just a piece of hardware. You can run any OS on it
2010-02-11T06:20:00.000Z	elijah	phong_	It is no different than buying a Windows PC
2010-02-11T06:20:00.000Z	phong_	elijah	but i can do more stuffs in windows then in mac
2010-02-11T06:23:00.000Z	elijah	phong_	Yes, you definitely have many more popular options on Windows but there are many less popular options and equivelants for Ubuntu
