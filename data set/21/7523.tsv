2007-06-25T11:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow		If I want to try and install ati video drivers and I make a copy of Xorg before I do and things go wrong.  Can I just replace my xorg with the working one and get back into my system?
2007-06-25T11:41:00.000Z	ShackJack	Jack_Sparrow	yep..
2007-07-15T07:32:00.000Z	ShackJack	Jack_Sparrow	yep.... Then select is from sessions in login screen...
2007-07-15T07:32:00.000Z	ShackJack	Jack_Sparrow	Or you can use a kubunut live CS
2007-07-15T07:34:00.000Z	ShackJack	Jack_Sparrow	yes, but I use aptitude instead of apt-get (better at dependency removing if tou decide to uninstlal)
2007-07-15T07:34:00.000Z	ShackJack	Jack_Sparrow	sudo aptitude install kubuntu-desktop   --
2007-07-15T07:35:00.000Z	ShackJack	Jack_Sparrow	syntax is the same but aptitude I think is better at clearing out the cruft if you decide to uninstall... sudo aptitude purge kubuntu-desktop :)
2007-07-22T08:03:00.000Z	ShackJack	Jack_Sparrow	Yeah, I have shrink other partition, but then have to fiddle with fstab, etc... And then they have these partition for disk image (useless) and "utilities" which I'd like to nuke. Just didn't know if it'd be easier to just repartition/reinstall....
2007-07-22T08:04:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ShackJack	I would leave the dell restore until it is out of warrantee.
2007-07-22T08:05:00.000Z	ShackJack	Jack_Sparrow	stefg: O.K. -- I'd ask over at Dell support chat - but they're useless, usually...
2007-07-22T08:05:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ShackJack	It is not hurting anything and you will most likely not fill up the drive before the warrantee expires..  FYI those like to run hot, use a coolpad to extend the life of the laptop.
2007-07-22T08:06:00.000Z	ShackJack	Jack_Sparrow	desktop - not laptop :)
2007-07-22T08:06:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ShackJack	Ok.. sorry
2007-07-31T06:21:00.000Z	ShackJack	Jack_Sparrow	what's fwcutter?
2007-07-31T06:21:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ShackJack	tool for installing drivers for bcm43xx wireless cards
2007-07-31T06:24:00.000Z	ShackJack	Jack_Sparrow	way ahead of ya :)
2007-08-04T07:10:00.000Z	ShackJack	Jack_Sparrow	That's what he seems to be saying ;)
2007-08-05T07:24:00.000Z	ShackJack	Jack_Sparrow	ubotu is sleeping...
2007-08-05T07:25:00.000Z	ShackJack	Jack_Sparrow	Erp nevermind - you PM'd...
2007-08-05T15:20:00.000Z	ShackJack	Jack_Sparrow	Starting with that can help when LiveCd starting linux kernel freezes for some, no?
