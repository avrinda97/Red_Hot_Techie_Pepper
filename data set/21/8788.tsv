2006-01-10T14:17:00.000Z	john__		Anyone...if I installed grub to my linux partition and that was on the 2nd partition of the first drive at the beginning of the partition, would it be hd0,2
2006-01-10T14:17:00.000Z	john__		?
2006-01-10T14:18:00.000Z	john__		hd0 is the first drive yes?
2006-01-10T14:18:00.000Z	john__		then the 1 means 2nd partition?
2006-01-10T14:18:00.000Z	john__		so the last number does not mean beginning or end of the partition?
2006-01-10T14:18:00.000Z	john__		okso hd0,1
2006-01-10T14:19:00.000Z	john__		so all agreed that hd0,1 means the 2nd partition on the first drive
2006-01-10T14:19:00.000Z	rich-	john__	yes =D
2006-01-10T14:19:00.000Z	john__	rich-	are you sure now cos this will rape my pc if its wrong
2006-01-10T14:20:00.000Z	rich-	john__	it can always be rescued.. and on the question of how sure I am, I've been working with bootloaders for about a week nonstop now =D
2006-01-10T14:20:00.000Z	john__	rich-	so if my windows install is on the first partition it would be hd0,0
2006-01-10T14:20:00.000Z	rich-	john__	yes
2006-01-10T14:20:00.000Z	john__		therefore hd0 is the MBR
2006-01-10T14:21:00.000Z	rich-	john__	aka hda1
2006-01-10T14:21:00.000Z	john__		/dev/hda1
2006-01-10T14:21:00.000Z	john__		ya?
2006-01-10T14:21:00.000Z	rich-		yes
