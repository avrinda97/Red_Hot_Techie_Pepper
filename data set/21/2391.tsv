2012-10-04T18:51:00.000Z	nwillems		Has anyone experience ubuntu overwriting files after a power failure? I have jenkins installed and after a power failure it was reverted back to the old one from the repos :(
2012-10-04T18:51:00.000Z	tyler_d	nwillems	in the event of a power failure the only way to ensure a sane system is to re-install
2012-10-04T18:52:00.000Z	tyler_d	nwillems	I would suggest that, and a ups
2012-10-04T18:52:00.000Z	nwillems	tyler_d	as in a complete reinstall? Not just disk-check/cleanup maybee some sanity check of files?
2012-10-04T18:53:00.000Z	tyler_d	nwillems	the only way to ensure sanity is a complete re-install. the problem being that procs write to disk, when a power failure occurs its the same as the disk becoming full. you don't know where and at what point and what files were opened or written to and just stopped.
2012-10-04T18:54:00.000Z	nwillems	tyler_d	But these files that were open would probably have some faulty file ending, or how?
2012-10-04T18:54:00.000Z	tyler_d	nwillems	however, if you are satisfied with a few sanity checks then I would say cary on. but in the future if something doesn't behave as it should... it is possibly related to this.
2012-10-04T18:55:00.000Z	tyler_d	nwillems	I don't know how all of your applications write to files or swap or memory; nor all of your daemons running.
2012-10-04T18:55:00.000Z	nwillems	tyler_d	but back to the original problem, I had made a symlink from jenkins-<newer.version>.war
2012-10-04T18:56:00.000Z	tyler_d	nwillems	... ok?
2012-10-04T18:56:00.000Z	tyler_d		I missed the orig question sorry.
2012-10-04T18:57:00.000Z	nwillems		* to jenkins-<newer.version>.war from jenkins.war, and after this power failure, the symlink was gone and the original jenkins.war(as in the one installed by apt-get) was back. How so?
2012-10-04T18:57:00.000Z	nwillems	tyler_d	And i accidentially hit my enter-button to soon :(
2012-10-04T18:58:00.000Z	tyler_d	nwillems	so your sym link is not htere?
2012-10-04T18:58:00.000Z	nwillems	tyler_d	no, it is replaced by the original package. It seems that ubuntu made som recover mode, and discovered that jenkins.war was no longer the one from the package and then replaced it :s
2012-10-04T19:00:00.000Z	nwillems	tyler_d	sorry, yes it is not there. it is replaced.
2012-10-04T19:00:00.000Z	tyler_d	nwillems	I do not know what that package is I'm sorry. But my advise is still the same; you are trying to fix a volatile system that is not predictable now; and who knows the levels that this is now broken.
2012-10-04T19:03:00.000Z	nwillems	tyler_d	Its a 30M file - it doesn't just get there. The jenkins.war is located in /usr/shar/jenkins/jenkins.war, i switched the real file for a symlink to a file in the same dir. It just seems VERY strange that it is replaced. If the system failed, it should just recover any broken inodes or such and then get up and running again, not replace my files. So I'm seeking an explanation on how this happened.
2012-10-04T19:04:00.000Z	tyler_d	nwillems	well, sorry I couldn't offer an explanation on that for you. best of luck
2012-10-04T19:05:00.000Z	nwillems	tyler_d	Thanks anyway. Do you know of any ubuntu-dev channel I could join and ask?
2012-10-04T19:05:00.000Z	tyler_d	nwillems	unfortunately not
