2010-07-29T05:48:00.000Z	arrrghhh		yea.. sorry for the off topic
2010-07-29T05:48:00.000Z	arrrghhh		i still want some help with rtorrent :D
2010-07-29T05:49:00.000Z	arrrghhh		but i will stop with that.
2010-07-29T05:49:00.000Z	maco	arrrghhh	psilo2: um a bit offtopic folks
2010-07-29T05:58:00.000Z	arrrghhh	maco	but you can't hardly call it perfect...
2010-07-29T05:58:00.000Z	maco	arrrghhh	webchat: when you use gnome apps in kde, they get bubbles exactly the same as kde ones. when you use kde i apps in gnome, i believe the same thing happens. throughout 10.04 and 10.10 devel cycles apps' tray stuff has been being converted over to make menus on tray items work the same too
2010-07-29T06:03:00.000Z	arrrghhh	maco	they're doing a native port right?  how's the progress on that?
2010-07-29T06:03:00.000Z	maco	arrrghhh	i dont know. i dont use windows except at work where im not admin
2010-07-29T06:17:00.000Z	maco	arrrghhh	oy, no violence
2010-08-12T02:16:00.000Z	maco	arrrghhh	don't call people names
2010-08-12T02:16:00.000Z	arrrghhh	maco	i didn't call him anything.
2010-08-12T02:17:00.000Z	maco	arrrghhh	"lazy piece of"?
2010-08-29T00:57:00.000Z	maco	arrrghhh	intok is right. windows viruses can hide while windows is running. they cant hide while its off and linux is running
2010-08-29T00:58:00.000Z	maco	arrrghhh	one of the ubuntu core-devs is maintaining clam-av in ubuntu to ensure that the latest sigs are quickly available in the repo
2010-08-29T00:59:00.000Z	arrrghhh	maco	true... but if you're running windows, nothing will replace something that actively watches like nod32.
2010-08-29T00:59:00.000Z	arrrghhh	maco	i recommended clamav as well...
2010-08-29T01:00:00.000Z	maco	arrrghhh	i dont think ive ever had anything that actively watched... symantec and mcafee just do a daily scan, dont they?
2010-08-29T01:01:00.000Z	arrrghhh	maco	really?  depends on the version/type, but most of the better ones have some sort of active hooks into the OS.  symantec corporate does, nod32 does, i haven't used any norton product since 2004 but they did back then... i've never used mcafee
2010-08-29T01:01:00.000Z	maco	arrrghhh	*shrug* ive never had an AV alert me "something is trying to get in" (for that i'd use an IDS like Snort) just "something is already in"
2010-08-29T01:02:00.000Z	arrrghhh	maco	it's more for like scanning a file before it's finished officially downloading, that type of thing.  like i said, there's proactive hooks in the system.
2010-11-05T08:47:00.000Z	maco	arrrghhh	make it?
