2012-02-09T04:27:00.000Z	recon_lap	ActionParsnip	hi there, seems like a rerun of last night,
2012-02-09T04:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	recon_lap	use Lubuntu 11.04 and you'll be fine :)
2012-02-09T04:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	recon_lap	if you don't like unity you don't have to use it...
2012-02-09T04:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	recon_lap	Unity is a shell for Gnome3...
2012-02-09T04:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	recon_lap	Ubuntu Oneiric uses Gnome3 by default
2012-02-09T04:44:00.000Z	recon_lap	ActionParsnip	think i tried gnome-shell, could not configure destop much , then i tried mint , then i went back to 10.04
2012-02-09T04:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	recon_lap	tried XFCE, LXDE, KDE, E17 ....?
2012-02-09T04:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	recon_lap	you do know that Gnome is not the only desktop environment...right?
2012-02-09T04:47:00.000Z	recon_lap	ActionParsnip	, i'm just waiting and hope it's better in 13.04
2012-02-09T04:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	recon_lap	I'd just switch desktop. XFCE is a lot like Gnome2 and you can run all your Gnome apps there
2012-02-09T04:49:00.000Z	recon_lap	ActionParsnip	tried xfce, it's the desktop in mint, but i'm odd and like my toolbar vertical on the left of screen
2012-02-09T04:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	recon_lap	if you got used to Unity then use it I guess, or you could make your own using xfpanel and so on
2012-02-09T04:51:00.000Z	recon_lap	ActionParsnip	hell no i did not get used to unity, I stuck with 10.04
2012-02-09T04:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	recon_lap	same kinda deal :)
2012-02-09T04:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	recon_lap	just no compiz muck messing things up :)
2012-02-09T04:55:00.000Z	recon_lap	ActionParsnip	yep, none of the fancy wiggly windows muck for me
2012-02-09T04:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	recon_lap	openbox here (LXDE WM :D )
2012-02-09T04:58:00.000Z	recon_lap	ActionParsnip	my problem with xfce was i could not put the tootbar vertically on the right , and the spellchecker did not seem to be integrated into text boxes
2012-02-09T07:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	recon_lap	goddard: finf downloadvault | grep -i adult
2012-02-10T00:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	recon_lap	some apps need the features in the oracle one, most times the open one will be ok
2012-02-10T00:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	recon_lap	sure, there are commands to switch between
