2005-01-05T12:29:00.000Z	bob2		it doesn't matter
2005-01-05T12:30:00.000Z	bob2		how would that help?

2005-01-05T12:31:00.000Z	bob2		if I knew the answer, I'd have told you an hour ago
2005-01-05T12:32:00.000Z	bob2		it seems very much like you skipped a step in the instructions, tho
2005-01-05T12:32:00.000Z	bob2		perhaps forgetting to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH or MOZILLA_STAR_HOME (or whatever it's called nowadays)
2005-01-05T12:33:00.000Z	bob2		I don't know if you have to or not
