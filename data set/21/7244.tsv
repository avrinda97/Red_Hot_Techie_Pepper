2010-07-07T13:27:00.000Z	tdn		I use Ubuntun 10.04 LTS with encrypted home dirs. I had to do some maintenance including swapping of two users' UIDs and GIDs. So I did a deluser on the users and a delgroup on the groups. Then I created the users and groups again with the corrects UIDs/GIDs. Then I chowned all the users' files under /home/$USER and /home/.ecryptfs/$USER. Then I reset password with passwd $USER. But now the users cannot log in -- thus cannot decrypt their files. What do

2010-07-07T13:29:00.000Z	tdn	Jordan_U	ok, I just asked about how I can correct this?
2010-07-07T13:30:00.000Z	tdn	Jordan_U	do you have any idea how to solve this?
2010-07-07T13:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	tdn	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EncryptedPrivateDirectory#Recovering%20Your%20Mount%20Passphrase , also try #ecryptfs on irc.oftc.net
2010-07-07T13:34:00.000Z	tdn	Jordan_U	ok.
2011-03-31T12:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	tdn	If at all possible use a CD (Mac's BIOS implementations are buggy when it comes to booting from USB).
2011-03-31T13:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	tdn	Apple's BIOS implementation is buggy. This is a known problem.
2011-03-31T13:01:00.000Z	tdn	Jordan_U	ok, but booting from a normal cdrom should work? I was told that this would not work though.
2011-03-31T13:01:00.000Z	tdn	Jordan_U	this is the brand new mac book pro. Does it require natty to work? Or will maverick work on it?
2011-03-31T13:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	tdn	Maverick should work (though how well individual pieces of hardware are supported I don't know).
2011-03-31T13:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	tdn	Are you trying to install 32 bit or 64 bit Ubuntu?
2011-03-31T13:05:00.000Z	tdn	Jordan_U	preferably 64 bit. Is there any reason to use 32 bit when I have a i7 processor?
2011-03-31T13:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	tdn	This iso should work (when burned to a real CD): http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ports/releases/10.10/release/ubuntu-10.10-desktop-amd64+mac.iso If you want the torrent link or the alternate or other install CDs look for the '+mac' versions @ http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ports/releases/10.10/release/ .
2011-03-31T13:06:00.000Z	tdn	Jordan_U	so there is a specific mac iso? I could not find this via ubuntu.com.
2011-03-31T13:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	tdn	Only the 64 bit Ubuntu images have EFI support, this ironically *prevents* them from booting properly on macs due to further bugs in Apple's firmware. The +mac is identical to the normal 64 bit image, but with EFI support *removed*.
2011-03-31T13:08:00.000Z	tdn	Jordan_U	ok.
2011-03-31T13:08:00.000Z	tdn	Jordan_U	how do I find that mac iso from ubuntu.com download section?
2011-03-31T13:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	tdn	It's not linked from the normal downloads page.
2011-03-31T13:09:00.000Z	tdn	Jordan_U	why not? Shouldnt it be?
2011-03-31T13:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	tdn	I don't know. It probably should be. If you file a bug report against the Ubuntu website they may add it (especially since they already have mac specific instructions).
