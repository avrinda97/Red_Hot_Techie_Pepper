2007-04-20T09:46:00.000Z	albert		i have two questions: i installed the textbased alternate of ubuntu and everytime i install software, which ist available on the cd too, the system asks me to instert the cd. is there a way of activating "download everything"?
2007-04-20T09:47:00.000Z	albert		the second: do i need du edit my sources.list like in edgy?
2007-04-20T09:47:00.000Z	Pelo	albert	 open up sources manager and uncheck the cd
2007-05-01T11:18:00.000Z	Pelo	albert	 windows first then ubuntu that way when grub is installed it will see the windows and add it to the boot menu
2007-05-01T11:18:00.000Z	albert	Pelo	kk
2007-05-01T11:18:00.000Z	albert	Pelo	as i guessed
2007-05-01T11:18:00.000Z	Pelo	albert	 I'm speaking from expereince I did it the other way
2007-05-01T11:19:00.000Z	albert	Pelo	sounds like an experience :D
2007-05-01T11:19:00.000Z	Pelo	albert	 it would have been easier if windows had been on the same hdd,  I had to remap something , and it took forever to find the instructions
2007-05-01T11:21:00.000Z	albert	Pelo	i'm quite screwed too.. i got 4 primary partitions for linux and i never knew about this limitation and my second harddrive gives me a blinking prompt as master... so repartitioning, ofcourse..
2007-05-01T11:22:00.000Z	Pelo	albert	 I donT' even understand most of what you wrote,  so all I can say is : Best of luck ;-0
2007-05-01T11:22:00.000Z	albert	Pelo	thx :D
2007-05-08T07:46:00.000Z	Pelo	albert	 sorry
2007-05-15T11:24:00.000Z	Pelo	albert	 becaue you need to eject to finalize
2007-05-15T11:25:00.000Z	albert	Pelo	even though it's almost 10 times faster compared to windows
2007-05-15T11:25:00.000Z	Pelo	albert	 congrats
2007-05-15T11:25:00.000Z	Pelo	albert	 maybe your windows only does it in usb1 which is slower
2007-05-20T11:34:00.000Z	Pelo	albert	 it should make a new one
2007-05-20T11:34:00.000Z	albert	Pelo	will it recognize the ubuntu-server and windows install?
2007-08-06T09:56:00.000Z	Pelo	albert	 try asking in #firefox
2007-08-06T15:20:00.000Z	Pelo	albert	 nvu
