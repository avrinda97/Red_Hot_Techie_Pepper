2012-11-25T17:22:00.000Z	bampersand		Hi. I'm using 12.04 and my DVD drive isn't working. It ejects fine just doesn't seem to do anything (it worked when I had windows), any ideas? I've googled but most problems are only for when a DVD video isn't working, etc.
2012-11-25T17:23:00.000Z	16SAAK2LL	bampersand	is it a SATA drive?
2012-11-25T17:23:00.000Z	bampersand	16SAAK2LL	I'm not sure
2012-11-25T17:25:00.000Z	16SAAK2LL	bampersand	well, that is not too easy to say without any information. Does the drive appear during startup (BIOS)?
2012-11-25T17:35:00.000Z	bampersand	16SAAK2LL	it's a sata dvd drive
2012-11-25T17:36:00.000Z	16SAAK2LL	bampersand	does it appear at startup? is it activated in BIOS setup?
2012-11-25T17:44:00.000Z	bampersand	16SAAK2LL	i'm in my bios setup, what exactly am I looking for?
2012-11-25T17:45:00.000Z	16SAAK2LL	bampersand	can u tell me what ur bios is?
2012-11-25T17:52:00.000Z	16SAAK2LL	bampersand	plase run in termianl as root: sg_map -i
2012-11-25T17:52:00.000Z	16SAAK2LL	bampersand	if not installed, run apt-get install sg3-utils before (as root, too)

2012-11-25T17:54:00.000Z	bampersand	16SAAK2LL	it opens/ejects fine too. I wonder what the problem is.
2012-11-25T17:55:00.000Z	16SAAK2LL	bampersand	that is what it would do when it was not connected by SATA, too, or did you open/close the tray by using OS functionality or by pressing th ebutton on the drive?
2012-11-25T17:58:00.000Z	16SAAK2LL	bampersand	so please start "dmesg | tail" and put in a CD/DVD and post the output

2012-11-25T17:59:00.000Z	16SAAK2LL	bampersand	u inserted a disk?
2012-11-25T18:01:00.000Z	bampersand	16SAAK2LL	when the disc is inserted the dvd reader led flashes
2012-11-25T18:02:00.000Z	16SAAK2LL	bampersand	but we talk about the first drive here, right? http://paste.ubuntu.com/1385132/
2012-11-25T18:02:00.000Z	bampersand	16SAAK2LL	yeah.
2012-11-25T18:05:00.000Z	16SAAK2LL	bampersand	I am slowly out of idea, sometimes there seem to be problems when drives are set as slaves and not masters (see http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1950008 ), but I am not sure about that issue; so I am sorry, but I guess I cannot really help you.
2012-11-25T18:05:00.000Z	bampersand	16SAAK2LL	okay thanks for your help.
