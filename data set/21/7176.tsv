2007-11-27T16:47:00.000Z	Slart	ubuntufreak	looks like you have some old updates that didn't finish properly.. go into a terminal and run this "sudo apt-get install"..
2007-11-27T16:59:00.000Z	ubuntufreak	Slart	when i try it i get this error http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/45986
2007-11-27T17:00:00.000Z	Slart	ubuntufreak	ok.. seems like it's cupsys that's being naughty.. try this.. "sudo dpkg-reconfigure cupsys"
2007-11-27T17:01:00.000Z	ubuntufreak	Slart	I would try that now
2007-11-27T17:02:00.000Z	ubuntufreak	Slart	this is what i get http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/45987/
2007-11-27T17:04:00.000Z	Slart	ubuntufreak	ok.. we'll try removing it and installing it again then.. "sudo apt-get install --reinstall cupsys" , see if that works
2007-11-27T17:06:00.000Z	ubuntufreak	Slart	still i get an error http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/45988/
2007-11-27T17:07:00.000Z	Slart	ubuntufreak	last try then.. we add a --purge "sudo apt-get install --reinstall --purge cupsys"
2007-11-27T17:08:00.000Z	ubuntufreak	Slart	No way, still i get the same error
2007-11-27T17:08:00.000Z	Slart	ubuntufreak	ok.. let's check some logs.. see if they will tell us someting.. "tail /var/log/syslog".. anything there about cupsys?
2007-11-27T17:10:00.000Z	ubuntufreak	Slart	Here it is http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/45989/
2007-11-27T17:11:00.000Z	Slart	ubuntufreak	nothing there about cupsys... hang on.. I'll see if we can't make apt-get tell us a little more about what is going wrong
2007-11-27T17:12:00.000Z	ubuntufreak	Slart	ok
2007-11-27T17:17:00.000Z	Slart	ubuntufreak	nope.. didn't find anything.. what happened is this... something went wrong with the update of cupsys (handles printing in linux), apt-get get's the error message and then assumes that cupsys isn't installed properly so every time you install something it will try to isntall cupsys again.. since it's still in the to-do-queue
2007-11-27T17:18:00.000Z	Slart	ubuntufreak	you could try removing cupsys altogether.. using the --purge switch.. and then reinstall it. but I'm not sure that would work either
2007-11-27T17:19:00.000Z	ubuntufreak	Slart	Anyway im not using any printing media with my system, would it be a problem if i remove it completely and how to do that
2007-11-27T17:19:00.000Z	Slart	ubuntufreak	nope.. no problem.. to remove it you run "sudo apt-get remove --purge cupsys"
2007-11-27T17:21:00.000Z	ubuntufreak	Slart	I get a warning " dpkg - warning: while removing cupsys, directory `/etc/cups/ssl' not empty so not removed."
2007-11-27T17:21:00.000Z	Slart	ubuntufreak	that's alright.. cupsys probably installed some files there.. it's no big deal
2007-11-27T17:22:00.000Z	ubuntufreak	Slart	Thanks for your kind help :)
2007-11-27T17:22:00.000Z	Slart	ubuntufreak	you're welcome
