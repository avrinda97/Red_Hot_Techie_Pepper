2007-09-13T06:46:00.000Z	pwnd_`		I guess I'm f'd?
2007-09-13T06:46:00.000Z	pwnd_`		Or could I get someone to build them for me?
2007-09-13T06:47:00.000Z	jrib	pwnd_`	what are you trying to do?
2007-09-13T06:47:00.000Z	pwnd_`	jrib	install netgear fa311 card drivers
2007-09-13T06:47:00.000Z	jrib	pwnd_`	build-essential is on the cd you installed ubuntu with.  But have you seen the wireless docs on the wiki?
2007-09-13T06:48:00.000Z	pwnd_`	jrib	it's wired.
2007-09-13T06:48:00.000Z	pwnd_`	jrib	my ubtunu sees it in the package manager, but in networking it doesn't work
2007-09-13T06:50:00.000Z	pwnd_`	jrib	any ideas with it being wired instead?
2007-09-13T06:51:00.000Z	jrib	pwnd_`	not really.  I see a lot of hits on google though.  Some suggest that you recompile your kernel.  Is that what you were trying?
2007-09-13T06:52:00.000Z	pwnd_`	jrib	not at all. I just get other people's problems, but nothing suggesting doing that. I dont' even know how to do that.
2007-09-13T06:56:00.000Z	jrib	pwnd_`	you are using feisty?
2007-09-13T06:56:00.000Z	pwnd_`	jrib	it's 6.06 :/ I can't update until I get nets on it
2007-09-13T06:57:00.000Z	jrib	pwnd_`	I think it may just work if you get feisty, I see your card in the changelog which may be related to your issue http://changelogs.ubuntu.com/changelogs/pool/main/libp/libpci2/libpci2_2.1.11-2/changelog .  You can't download a feisty iso and install that?
2007-09-13T06:57:00.000Z	pwnd_`	jrib	idk how I'm getting feisty then :P Are they available by mail yet?
2007-09-13T06:58:00.000Z	jrib	pwnd_`	yes, but that would take about a month.  Can't you download it on your current connection?
2007-09-13T06:58:00.000Z	pwnd_`	jrib	I'm on windows on this machine.
2007-09-13T06:58:00.000Z	jrib	pwnd_`	right, but you download the .iso, burn it, and install feisty.  Am I missing something?
2007-09-13T06:59:00.000Z	pwnd_`	jrib	that I don't have clean cds. I'll go buy some tomorrow, I suppose.
2007-09-13T06:59:00.000Z	jrib	pwnd_`	that's what I would do
2007-09-13T06:59:00.000Z	pwnd_`	jrib	alright. Thanks.
