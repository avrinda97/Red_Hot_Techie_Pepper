2005-10-24T11:31:00.000Z	Peps		My network configuration (laptop) hangs for a long time at boot. My guess is it tries to activate eth0 (wireless) even thou it is disabled in /etc/network/interfaces. Can anyone help - it's very annoying
2005-10-24T11:31:00.000Z	DVSoftware	Peps	ctrl+c when it hangs
2005-10-24T11:31:00.000Z	Peps		and manually ifup it. I know - still very annoying
2005-10-24T11:32:00.000Z	Peps		no. In the end it gives up and all is OK, it's just takes more than a minute
2005-10-24T11:33:00.000Z	Peps		dmesg  | grep eth0 ==> eth0: no IPv6 routers present
2005-10-24T11:34:00.000Z	Peps		eth0 is wireless, eth1 ethernet
