2010-10-13T08:38:00.000Z	Kiba		hi
2010-10-13T08:38:00.000Z	Kiba		my boatloader is broke
2010-10-13T08:38:00.000Z	Kiba		and I forgot my window password :(
2010-10-13T08:38:00.000Z	Kiba		grub is broke :(
2010-10-13T08:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kiba	can you expand on "broke", it doesn't tell us anything at all
2010-10-13T08:38:00.000Z	Kiba	ActionParsnip	I cannot boot into linux
2010-10-13T08:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kiba	ok and what actually happens when you try to boot, what happens onscreen....
2010-10-13T08:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kiba	make a bootable usb using a different system and you can reinstall grub. I am not conversant with grub but you CAN boot if you type certain commands at the prompt
2010-10-13T08:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kiba	i'd put more text than that in your question like the stuff I had to get out of you earlier, people are more likely to reply
2010-10-13T08:51:00.000Z	Kiba	ActionParsnip	well, I am dropped into grub rescue prompt
2010-10-13T08:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kiba	yes you told me earlier, but if you must repeat then if you give some details right off the bat then you will most likely be helped more
2010-10-13T08:52:00.000Z	Kiba	ActionParsnip	what information do you want?
2010-10-13T08:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kiba	no, when you type a question in here add detail. Instead of "My system won't boot" you could try adding at least some details. You will get more help
2010-10-13T08:53:00.000Z	Kiba	ActionParsnip	I am using wubi ubuntu
2010-10-13T08:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kiba	my suggestion is to use a different PC to make a bootable USB device / SD card and boot that, or websearch how to give raw commands to grub to make it boot
2010-10-13T08:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kiba	oh dear, wubi really sucks
2010-10-13T08:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kiba	may help: http://calamari.wordpress.com/2009/12/01/fixing-a-broken-wubi-grub-after-ubuntu-updates/
2010-10-13T08:55:00.000Z	Kiba	ActionParsnip	the only problem is that I forgot my window password :(
2010-10-13T08:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Kiba	ask about that in ##windows then
