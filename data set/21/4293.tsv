2009-03-23T07:46:00.000Z	bruce89	cybertaur1	actually, you'll need the X headers
2009-03-23T07:46:00.000Z	cybertaur1	bruce89	can you help me get them?
2009-03-23T07:47:00.000Z	bruce89	cybertaur1	perhaps libx11-dev
2009-03-23T07:47:00.000Z	cybertaur1	bruce89	sudo apt-get install libx11-dev is already there
2009-03-23T07:48:00.000Z	bruce89	cybertaur1	what are you compiling?
2009-03-23T07:49:00.000Z	cybertaur1	bruce89	i don't really know at this point. i think i'm trying to compile xf86-video-intel-2.6.0 from http://intellinuxgraphics.org/
2009-03-23T07:49:00.000Z	cybertaur1	bruce89	but i have an error "No package 'xorg-server' found" (i seem to have fixed the other error it was giving me)
2009-03-23T07:50:00.000Z	bruce89	cybertaur1	look at the build dependencies at http://packages.ubuntu.com/source/jaunty/xserver-xorg-video-intel
2009-03-23T07:50:00.000Z	bruce89	cybertaur1	ignore quilt and debhelper
2009-03-23T07:50:00.000Z	bruce89	cybertaur1	xserver-xorg-dev
2009-03-23T07:52:00.000Z	cybertaur1	bruce89	thanks, that got rid of some of the problems, but now i have another error: http://pastebin.com/m49a0c26 ("Requested 'libdrm >= 2.4.3' but version of libdrm is 2.3.1" if you don't want to click through)
2009-03-23T07:53:00.000Z	bruce89	cybertaur1	it's asking for a newer libdrm than Intrepid has, you'd have to download and compile that also
2009-03-23T07:54:00.000Z	cybertaur1	bruce89	sudo apt-get install libdrm says i'm on the latest one, and i just ran apt-get update & upgrade
2009-03-23T07:54:00.000Z	bruce89	cybertaur1	I know, but this package needs 2.4.3, Intrepid has 2.3.1
2009-03-23T07:57:00.000Z	bruce89	cybertaur1	in other words, it ain't going to happen unless you want to compile a new libdrm at least
2009-03-23T07:57:00.000Z	cybertaur1	bruce89	thank you, i think i just compiled the new libdrm from launchpad.net, and i'm trying to compile the drivers now
2009-03-23T07:57:00.000Z	cybertaur1	bruce89	success! should i restart something?
2009-03-23T07:58:00.000Z	bruce89	cybertaur1	perhaps
2009-03-23T07:58:00.000Z	cybertaur1	bruce89	thanks a ton, by the way
2009-03-23T07:59:00.000Z	cybertaur1	bruce89	sorry to keep asking questions, but is there a way to enable certain drivers over others? or does installing the driver automatically make it the one in use?
2009-03-23T07:59:00.000Z	bruce89	cybertaur1	don't know
