2005-09-10T10:10:00.000Z	Orby		could someone point me to where i can find libc6-dev, i havnt any internet on the box i'm trying to finish but i need libc6-dev and i cant find it :|
2005-09-10T10:10:00.000Z	bob2	Orby	archive.u.c/ubuntu/pool/main/g/glibc/
2005-09-10T10:11:00.000Z	bob2	Orby	if you have to ask tho, you want to be very careful, lest you break your system
2005-09-10T10:11:00.000Z	Orby	bob2	thank you very much! i been looking for ages :P
2005-09-10T10:29:00.000Z	bob2	Orby	why are you compiling a kernel?
2005-09-10T10:29:00.000Z	Orby	bob2	because i need to add support for my network card
2005-09-10T10:29:00.000Z	bob2	Orby	that's very unlikely to require recompiling the kernel
2005-09-10T10:29:00.000Z	bob2	Orby	what card is it?
2005-09-10T10:30:00.000Z	Orby	bob2	ummm marvell yukon 88E8036 PCI-E
2005-09-10T10:31:00.000Z	bob2	Orby	and why do you think you need to recompile your kernel?
2005-09-10T10:32:00.000Z	Orby	bob2	well i was looking for drivers and i found one, but it said i could add it to my source using a patch or compile a module, i tried to compile a module but it said the kernel source wasnt the same as the kernel i was running ( even though it is ) so i thought i would try the other way
2005-09-10T10:32:00.000Z	bob2	Orby	no, you can't compile modules against random kernel sources you download from kernel.org
2005-09-10T10:32:00.000Z	bob2	Orby	or even against the kernel sources from within ubuntu
2005-09-10T10:33:00.000Z	Orby	bob2	i'm running the same kernel as the source i have, they are both ubuntu ones
2005-09-10T10:33:00.000Z	bob2	Orby	you, like lynx_nhb, need to compile it (if it is indeed not in the ubuntu kernel already) against the correct kernel headers
2005-09-10T10:33:00.000Z	bob2	Orby	yes, you don't compile drivers against random kernel source trees
2005-09-10T10:33:00.000Z	Orby	bob2	i also have the kernel headers for the kernel i'm running
2005-09-10T10:34:00.000Z	bob2	Orby	then something went wrong with the compile
2005-09-10T10:34:00.000Z	Orby	bob2	thats why i thought i would roll my own kernel instead
2005-09-10T10:34:00.000Z	bob2	Orby	how would that help?
2005-09-10T10:35:00.000Z	Orby	bob2	it would then have the driver inside the kernel so i wouldnt have to make a module for the kernel i;m running
