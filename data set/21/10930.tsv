2006-05-04T06:51:00.000Z	ikaruga2099		ok guys, so if I want to get cgi and perl running on my system what packages do I need? is there a guide out there?
2006-05-04T06:51:00.000Z	Tomcat_	ikaruga2099	Everything installed by default
2006-05-04T06:51:00.000Z	Tomcat_	ikaruga2099	On a server, install "perl" package, that should be it.
2006-05-04T06:54:00.000Z	Tomcat_	ikaruga2099	Why would you need php5-cgi for perl/cgi? I got perl/cgi running on my system with just apache2 and perl.
2006-05-04T06:54:00.000Z	Tomcat_	ikaruga2099	Again, why? You don't need PHP to make perl and CGI work.
2006-05-04T06:55:00.000Z	Tomcat_	ikaruga2099	Do you have apache and perl installed?
2006-05-04T06:58:00.000Z	Tomcat_	ikaruga2099	You need to put "+ExecCGI" in the Options clause of the Apache config, for all directories where you have CGI scripts
2006-05-04T06:58:00.000Z	Tomcat_	ikaruga2099	You need to have all CGI scripts executable (chmod +x)
2006-05-04T06:59:00.000Z	Tomcat_	ikaruga2099	And you should add something like "AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .pl" to the directory in the config
2006-05-04T07:01:00.000Z	Tomcat_	ikaruga2099	You need to set +x on that permissions that the server will use to access the file.
2006-05-04T07:02:00.000Z	Tomcat_	ikaruga2099	So if the file is owned by www-data, you should do chmod u+x... if it's in the www-data group, do chmod g+x... if it's neither, do chmod o+x...
2006-05-04T07:02:00.000Z	Tomcat_	ikaruga2099	The easiest way is to "sudo -R o+x", but it's risky security-wise.
2006-05-04T07:03:00.000Z	Tomcat_	ikaruga2099	Mh... or maybe "sudo -R +x *"
2006-05-04T07:04:00.000Z	Tomcat_	ikaruga2099	In that case the permissions are not correct...
2006-05-04T07:04:00.000Z	Tomcat_	ikaruga2099	You also have to check if the directory is accessible.
2006-05-04T07:05:00.000Z	Tomcat_	ikaruga2099	In that case, what are the permissions on the file you are testing?
2006-05-04T07:10:00.000Z	Tomcat_	ikaruga2099	I checked it on my install... either ExecCGI is not correctly set or your permissions. Are you sure ExecCGI is on in that directory/virtualserver/process?
2006-05-04T07:13:00.000Z	Tomcat_	ikaruga2099	Okay, and the server is restarted since the config chance?
2006-05-04T07:14:00.000Z	Tomcat_	ikaruga2099	In that case I'm out of ideas... it should work.
2006-05-04T07:14:00.000Z	Tomcat_	ikaruga2099	Do you have an .htaccess file in that directory?
2006-05-04T07:14:00.000Z	Tomcat_	ikaruga2099	Okay, out of ideas then. :)
