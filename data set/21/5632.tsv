2007-09-25T10:36:00.000Z	MasonUS		K_Parted: have you looked at Partedmagic?
2007-09-25T10:36:00.000Z	MasonUS		K_Parted: I wish I could fix the problem for ya, but I'm afraid this is the best I can do :)
2007-09-25T10:37:00.000Z	MasonUS		K_Parted: The Ubuntu live disk boots with GParted I believe.
2007-09-25T10:37:00.000Z	MasonUS		K_Parted: its kind of overkill, but that might work for you.
2007-09-25T10:38:00.000Z	MasonUS		Sauvin: I thought it did, i just couldn't remember :)
2007-09-25T10:39:00.000Z	MasonUS		So, are there any BASH scripting pros in here? I really could use some help editing bash podder.
2007-09-25T10:41:00.000Z	MasonUS		:( guess not.
2007-09-25T10:41:00.000Z	MasonUS		afk a moment

2007-09-25T10:43:00.000Z	MasonUS	sethk	I want to edit a particular version of the bashpodder script

2007-09-25T10:43:00.000Z	MasonUS	sethk	I wanted it to run mp3toogg on every mp3 that it downloads as they download.

2007-09-25T10:44:00.000Z	sethk	MasonUS	I'll have to look at the script, of course.  I don't think I have it on my box, so do you have a url, or can you paste it?

2007-09-25T10:44:00.000Z	sethk	MasonUS	ok.  I'm dealing with support calls also, so if I'm not here, I'll be back shortly.
