2010-01-04T09:52:00.000Z	scunizi	bullgard	try .. ls /media/cdrom0
2010-01-04T09:54:00.000Z	bullgard	scunizi	'~$ ls /media/cdrom0' does obtain no output. What does this indicate?
2010-01-04T10:00:00.000Z	scunizi	bullgard	if that doesn't work use /media/cdrom0 ... unless you're trying to get to the guest additions for virtualbox.. then it's a bit different
2010-01-04T10:01:00.000Z	scunizi	bullgard	if you have more than on cdrom then /media/cdrom1 is typically the second
2010-01-04T10:01:00.000Z	scunizi	bullgard	that you're *doing it wrong*
2010-01-04T10:03:00.000Z	bullgard	scunizi	I do not use any virtualization software.
2010-01-04T10:03:00.000Z	bullgard	scunizi	I do not use more than one cd/dvd drive.
2010-01-04T10:04:00.000Z	scunizi	bullgard	ok.. so what happens when you "cd /media/cdrom0"  then issue a ... ls
2010-01-04T10:05:00.000Z	bullgard	scunizi	I do not understand your message: 'that you're *doing it wrong*'. Can you say it in other words, please?
2010-01-04T10:05:00.000Z	scunizi	bullgard	are you trying to look at the files on your cdrom?
2010-01-04T10:08:00.000Z	bullgard	scunizi	What I am trying, I have clearly stated at the outset: I'd like to find out if an audio CD is inserted in the tray of the CD/DVD drive.
2010-01-04T10:09:00.000Z	scunizi	bullgard	well.. I wasn't around at the outset.. you won't get a listing of an audio cd.. open Rhythmbox or another player and see if you can play the cd.. to rip it to your harddrive use ripperx
2010-01-04T10:10:00.000Z	bullgard	scunizi	I see. Rhythmbox certainly is not the most elemetary command for doing this.
2010-01-04T10:11:00.000Z	scunizi	bullgard	not a command.. a program listed at Applications>Sound & Video
2010-01-04T10:13:00.000Z	bullgard	scunizi	I know that already. This does not answer the question which I put here in this channel.
2010-01-04T10:14:00.000Z	scunizi	bullgard	at this point I came in after your question.. and now I'm tired of helping with this.. good luck
2010-01-04T10:14:00.000Z	bullgard	scunizi	Thank you.
2010-01-30T22:06:00.000Z	scunizi	bullgard	chatzilla should have a logging feature.. check it's menus
2010-01-30T22:10:00.000Z	bullgard	scunizi	I went through all Chatzilla menu items twice. I could not find a relevant menu item.
2010-01-30T22:11:00.000Z	scunizi	bullgard	might be time to use a different client
2010-01-30T22:11:00.000Z	bullgard	scunizi	Yes.
