2007-12-03T06:50:00.000Z	Tech-Mike		why is it like that in the first place - i didnt have that prob with 7.04...i dont think
2007-12-03T06:51:00.000Z	jrib	Tech-Mike	(you are not supposed to do that)
2007-12-03T06:43:00.000Z	jrib	Tech-Mike	is there any output when you run: find ~/.local ~/.config/ ! -user $USER
2007-12-03T06:48:00.000Z	Tech-Mike	jrib	/home/tech-mike/.config/autostart
2007-12-03T06:49:00.000Z	jrib	Tech-Mike	yes, you need to fix that.  Make sure you do not run gui apps with sudo.  To fix this, as your user, do: sudo chown -R $USER: ~/.config
2007-12-03T06:51:00.000Z	jrib	Tech-Mike	usually due to gui apps being run as sudo
2007-12-03T06:54:00.000Z	Tech-Mike	jrib	yes but somtimes it is easier to move things around with sudo nautilus :-P
2007-12-03T06:54:00.000Z	jrib	Tech-Mike	gksudo nautilus
2007-12-03T06:56:00.000Z	Tech-Mike	jrib	when runnin that command u gave i get 'chown: missing operand after 'tech-Mike:~/.config'
2007-12-03T06:57:00.000Z	jrib	Tech-Mike	you forgot a space
2007-12-03T06:58:00.000Z	Tech-Mike	jrib	- will i get this prob again if i sudo an app
2007-12-03T07:01:00.000Z	Tech-Mike	jrib	- in the console after running 'gnome-session-properties' and adding awn...i get 'could not save /home/tech-mike/.config/autostart/avant-window-navigator.desktop file'
2007-12-03T07:04:00.000Z	Tech-Mike	jrib	... ?
2007-12-03T07:13:00.000Z	Tech-Mike	jrib	- u there man?
2009-03-30T09:08:00.000Z	jrib	Tech-Mike	what do you want to hide exactly?   ls > FILE    will save (and overwrite) output to the file FILE
2009-03-30T09:10:00.000Z	Tech-Mike	jrib	when using dir - if theres a directory containing a space in the name (ex: The One ) it outputs The\ One....hide \
2009-03-30T09:10:00.000Z	jrib	Tech-Mike	use ls then
2009-03-30T09:11:00.000Z	Tech-Mike	jrib	trying now...also - is there an ls arg for numbered entries ?
2009-03-30T09:12:00.000Z	jrib	Tech-Mike	what do you mean?  By the way, it appears "--quoting-style" is the option you want, but ls defaults to not showing you escaped spaces so just use that
2009-03-30T09:12:00.000Z	Tech-Mike	jrib	ls argument to number lines
2009-03-30T09:13:00.000Z	jrib	Tech-Mike	you can use « nl » I guess...
