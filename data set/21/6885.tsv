2007-01-09T14:20:00.000Z	neutrinomass		Hi, I can't get nvidia to work, I get something about version mismatch in the kernel module and xorg's module (I didn't compile my own, just installed -restricted-modules from the repos)
2007-01-09T14:20:00.000Z	karmikaze	neutrinomass	check out lupine repos
2007-01-09T14:20:00.000Z	karmikaze		its mounted in media proqesi
2007-01-09T14:21:00.000Z	karmikaze		i have read perm, but it doesnt even look in there im certain
2007-01-09T14:21:00.000Z	neutrinomass	karmikaze	is the 8667 (or something like that) the legacy driver? Because one of them is that, and the other is 96xx I think (I don't remember the numbers exactly)
2007-01-09T14:21:00.000Z	karmikaze		check your linux-restricted-modules too
2007-01-09T14:21:00.000Z	karmikaze		but neutrinomass i couldnt get any nvidia stuff working til i used lupines repo.. dunno why, but they worked for me. what card you got?
2007-01-09T14:21:00.000Z	neutrinomass		Problem is they used to work and then I decided I don't want them :p
2007-01-09T14:22:00.000Z	karmikaze		ive had zero luck with nvidia on edgy, have to try another repo imho
2007-01-09T14:22:00.000Z	karmikaze		anyone use gnome sticky notes type thing, anyone tell me what the actually app is called and where its data is stored??
2007-01-09T14:22:00.000Z	karmikaze		T_T
2007-01-09T14:23:00.000Z	neutrinomass	karmikaze	Actually, very good point. This could be a kernel problem. The card doesn't show in lspci
2007-01-09T14:23:00.000Z	karmikaze		yep neutrinomass
2007-01-09T14:23:00.000Z	neutrinomass	karmikaze	tomboy ?
2007-01-09T14:23:00.000Z	karmikaze		mine didnt show in xorg either
2007-01-09T14:23:00.000Z	karmikaze		until i used lupines repo... then glxinfo knew my card
2007-01-09T14:23:00.000Z	karmikaze		!lupine
2007-01-09T14:23:00.000Z	karmikaze		!nvidia
2007-01-09T14:23:00.000Z	neutrinomass	karmikaze	Ok, I'll take a look into that....
2007-01-09T14:23:00.000Z	karmikaze		nrrr
2007-01-09T14:24:00.000Z	neutrinomass	karmikaze	I don't really want to mess with custom repos though and the official driver is known to work, so I'll try a bit more :) thanks
