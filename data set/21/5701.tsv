2007-12-29T02:56:00.000Z	oDesk		mv dir/*.* ../   this only moves the files.. i want to move folders too
2007-12-29T02:57:00.000Z	g2g591	oDesk	run mv foldername newfoldername
2007-12-29T02:57:00.000Z	oDesk	g2g591	the new folder is already exist with contents into it
2007-12-29T02:58:00.000Z	g2g591	oDesk	ok so run mv foldername newfoldername/foldername to move the folder to a subfolder of the newfolder
2007-12-29T02:59:00.000Z	oDesk	g2g591	i don't want to write command for every folder.. could i move all folders at once ?
2007-12-29T02:59:00.000Z	oDesk	g2g591	like i moved the files using   /*.*
2007-12-29T03:02:00.000Z	g2g591	oDesk	ok then lets use some bash scripting, "for x in folder1 folder2 folder3 ; mv $x foldername/$x"
2007-12-29T03:04:00.000Z	oDesk	g2g591	i did  mv folder1 folder2 dist
