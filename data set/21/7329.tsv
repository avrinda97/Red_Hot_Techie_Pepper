2006-12-11T16:58:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	LjL	wins. Anyways...onwards.
2006-12-27T15:29:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	LjL	clearly that point was missed. :P
2006-12-28T17:04:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	LjL	its something like 600+.
2006-12-29T06:00:00.000Z	LjL	Music_Shuffle	still, if you dislike KDE, i'm not sure there's much point in using KDE apps for most things...
2006-12-29T06:00:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	LjL	true. Although are we counting doing like I do and having like 5 WM's installed and interplaying with apps? I use a few KDe apps under Gnome >.>
2006-12-29T06:02:00.000Z	LjL	Music_Shuffle	well, it depends on how you see things. if you just want to choose the *program you like best* for each job you need to do, you'll have a mixture of KDE and GNOME and whatever programs. and that's fine, if it fits your goal. but if you mostly like the KDE programs (or, conversely, mostly like the GNOME programs), you should be using the matching environment IMHO.
2006-12-29T06:03:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	LjL	good point.  Prolly makes it work better.
2006-12-29T06:03:00.000Z	LjL	Music_Shuffle	myself, i try to stick to programs made for my DE, even in cases when i think other programs are *better*. i can understand very well how others might find this point of view a bit extreme -- what i cannot quite understand is "99% of the apps i use are KDE, but i use GNOME"
2006-12-29T06:04:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	LjL	lol true. I prefer to minimize mixing, but Gnome's torrent client, for example, I'm not a fan of. kTorrent is yay. ^^
2006-12-29T07:07:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	LjL	how does one reinstall X? chrisg0619 needs help with it. >.>
2006-12-29T07:08:00.000Z	LjL	Music_Shuffle	well, strictly speaking, "sudo apt-get --reinstall install xserver-xorg", but i doubt that will be of much use
2006-12-29T07:08:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	LjL	I dunno, I'm about to gogo PS2 with my brother, so I can't help him anymore. :X
2006-12-29T07:09:00.000Z	LjL	Music_Shuffle	chrisg0619: perhaps what you want is really dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2006-12-29T08:29:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	LjL	do you have like...a keybinding for that or something?
2007-05-02T15:56:00.000Z	LjL	Music_Shuffle	ouch... that is my fault =)
2007-05-02T15:56:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	LjL	ahh ok, wanted to make sure I wasn't just being stupid xD
2007-06-22T07:02:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	LjL	what does the -s do?
2007-06-22T07:03:00.000Z	LjL	Music_Shuffle	just specifies that a signal name/number follows
2007-06-22T07:04:00.000Z	LjL	Music_Shuffle	the "classic" syntax is "kill -9 PID", but that's not... precisely... a standard command syntax
2007-06-22T07:04:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	LjL	right, I had always used that version, which is why I was curious :P
