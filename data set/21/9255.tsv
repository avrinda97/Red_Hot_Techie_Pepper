2007-09-17T16:45:00.000Z	veco		i need help make not working
2007-09-17T16:45:00.000Z	gnomefreak	veco	error?
2007-09-17T16:46:00.000Z	gnomefreak	veco	see !pastebin
2007-09-17T16:47:00.000Z	gnomefreak	veco	that isnt make error that is a code error
2007-09-17T16:47:00.000Z	gnomefreak	veco	but make isnt causing that error more than likely its the makefile of the app causing it
2007-09-17T16:47:00.000Z	gnomefreak	veco	you need to ./configure first
2007-09-17T16:48:00.000Z	gnomefreak	veco	for full debug i would need to try it and i cant atm but its not you its the source thats messed up
2007-09-17T16:49:00.000Z	gnomefreak	veco	it happens to the best of us
2007-09-17T16:49:00.000Z	gnomefreak	veco	scan.c:845: error: called object  '<erroneous-expression>' is not a function
2007-09-17T16:50:00.000Z	gnomefreak	veco	you either are missing header files for kernel or the names changed and the source wasnt updated by the looks of it
2007-09-17T16:50:00.000Z	gnomefreak	veco	assuming you installed kernel-headers package as it is needed
2007-09-17T16:51:00.000Z	gnomefreak	veco	not without looking deep into source, make sure you have kernel-headers installed for your kernel
2007-09-17T16:52:00.000Z	gnomefreak	veco	what kernel?
2007-09-17T16:53:00.000Z	gnomefreak	veco	uname -a will tell you
2007-09-17T16:54:00.000Z	gnomefreak	veco	install kernel-headers-2.6.20-16-generic
2007-09-17T16:57:00.000Z	gnomefreak	veco	than its the source code
2007-09-17T16:57:00.000Z	gnomefreak	veco	make sure you have ALL build-deps installed including build-essential
2007-09-17T16:59:00.000Z	gnomefreak	veco	build depends i think you should move this to #ubuntu-offtopic or #ubuntu-motu is better place if people are there
2007-09-17T05:00:00.000Z	gnomefreak	veco	last time i got that it was a makefile issue
2007-09-17T05:01:00.000Z	gnomefreak	veco	tweeking rules file made it work but yours isnt running ./configure so it makes me think that maybe you are missing a step or it may be a py code or something
2007-09-17T05:01:00.000Z	gnomefreak	veco	but from the error its missing something one of the header files or wrong header files not much we can do about that
