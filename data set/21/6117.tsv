2009-05-30T08:23:00.000Z	donald_		Hey, I installed the latest Ubuntu 9.04, and everything works fine but the audio. According to the sound mixer I have an Intel HDA ALC888 and a ATI HDMI... neither work for audio. In WinXP, I have to download Realtek drivers because its a realtek HD audio device... please help?
2009-05-30T08:24:00.000Z	fryguy	donald_	you'll need to google for details, but you want to disable the ati hdmi audio
2009-05-30T08:24:00.000Z	fryguy	donald_	like i said you'll need to google for details
2009-05-30T08:24:00.000Z	fryguy	donald_	i don't have the machine that i did it with in front of me
2009-05-30T08:31:00.000Z	fryguy	donald_	rmmod
2009-05-30T08:35:00.000Z	fryguy	donald_	just use rmmmod
2009-05-30T08:36:00.000Z	fryguy	donald_	just rmmod
2009-05-30T08:37:00.000Z	donald_	fryguy	I'm new to Ubuntu, I dont know how to rmmod
2009-05-30T08:37:00.000Z	fryguy	donald_	sudo rmmod snd_hda_codec_atihdmi
2009-05-30T08:38:00.000Z	fryguy	donald_	lsmod, is it listed
2009-05-30T08:38:00.000Z	fryguy	donald_	no
2009-05-30T08:38:00.000Z	fryguy	donald_	lsmod and see if it's listed
2009-05-30T08:39:00.000Z	donald_	fryguy	its not listed
2009-05-30T08:39:00.000Z	fryguy	donald_	lsmod | grep ati, what is listed for sound
2009-05-30T08:40:00.000Z	fryguy	donald_	yah we already know that
2009-05-30T08:48:00.000Z	donald_	fryguy	its not even loaded as a module
2009-05-30T08:49:00.000Z	fryguy	donald_	it uses the same driver as hda_intel
2009-05-30T08:49:00.000Z	donald_	fryguy	can you suggest how to disable ati hdmi?
2009-05-30T08:50:00.000Z	fryguy	donald_	like i told you when you first asked the question, i did this on another machine and don't have the machine in front of me, so you'll have to google
2009-05-30T08:51:00.000Z	fryguy	donald_	ignore that, you need to fix the underlying problem before that dialog means anything
2009-05-30T08:53:00.000Z	donald_	fryguy	i am brand new to ubuntu and linux altogether. i do not know how to disable ati hdmi and i do not know what to search for on google.
