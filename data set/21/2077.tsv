2011-06-10T01:39:00.000Z	Xase		Well there is a way to back up, depending on how you do the install
2011-06-10T01:39:00.000Z	Xase		for some ppa-purge fixed it... others... no.
2011-06-10T01:40:00.000Z	Xase		I'd recommend a reinstall or recovery if things goterible.
2011-06-10T01:40:00.000Z	Xase		go terrible*
2011-06-10T01:40:00.000Z	Xase		Anyone know why an AMD computer with an AMD vision setup on Natty Narwhal would be... "Laggy" ?
2011-06-10T01:41:00.000Z	Xase		That way all your really vital files remain intact.
2011-06-10T01:42:00.000Z	Xase		It's good for tinkering and if and when stuff breaks, you don't have to go oh crap! where's my backup.
2011-06-10T01:43:00.000Z	Xase		I'm getting terrible lag on an ATI/AMD system with 4gigs of ram =/
2011-06-10T01:43:00.000Z	Xase		videos are choppy and there's an obvious delay with typing and stuff actually apppearing on screen...
2011-06-10T01:43:00.000Z	Xase		It wouldn't be a big deal if this wasn't being built as an arcade machine.
2011-06-10T01:43:00.000Z	fallenangel	Xase	YES! same problem here
2011-06-10T01:44:00.000Z	Xase	fallenangel	good then someone else can help draw attention to our woes.

2011-06-10T01:52:00.000Z	fallenangel	Xase	as in sudo sh ati-driver-installer-11-5-x86.x86_64.run --buildpkg Ubuntu/natty ? if thats what you mean, then yes.
2011-06-10T01:53:00.000Z	Xase	fallenangel	well you have 64bit and I have 32bit so it's good to know the problem isn't architecture related.
2011-06-10T01:54:00.000Z	Xase	fallenangel	does the package from ATI do anything?
