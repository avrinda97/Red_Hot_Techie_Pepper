2006-01-18T11:48:00.000Z	bodaciousb		that restarts x
2006-01-18T11:49:00.000Z	fangorious	bodaciousb	ctrl-alt-backspace kills your x session, and will drop you back to gdm/kdm/xdm iif you have it running
2006-01-18T11:49:00.000Z	fangorious	bodaciousb	after getting to the console you can /etc/init.d/{gdm,kdm,xdm} stop to kill the login manager
2006-01-18T11:52:00.000Z	fangorious	bodaciousb	did you stop gdm/kdm/xdm like I suggested?
2006-01-18T11:53:00.000Z	bodaciousb	fangorious	no, how do i do that?
2006-01-18T11:53:00.000Z	fangorious	bodaciousb	assuming gdm, /etc/init.d/gdm stop
2006-01-18T11:53:00.000Z	fangorious	bodaciousb	substitute kdm/xdm if appropriate
2006-01-18T11:54:00.000Z	bodaciousb	fangorious	/etc/init.d/gdm stop  jsut says gdm is not running
2006-01-18T11:55:00.000Z	fangorious	bodaciousb	do you get a gui login screen when you boot or log out of gnome/kde
2006-01-18T11:55:00.000Z	bodaciousb	fangorious	yeah, when i boot i get gui, and when i ctrl-alt-backsapce, the same
2006-01-18T11:56:00.000Z	fangorious	bodaciousb	maybe it's kdm, then, /etc/init.d/kdm stop
2006-01-18T11:57:00.000Z	fangorious	bodaciousb	guess you'll have to manually kill it with kill -9
2006-01-18T11:57:00.000Z	bodaciousb	fangorious	ok
2006-01-18T11:57:00.000Z	bodaciousb	fangorious	kill -9 doesnt do anything but tell me how to use it
2006-01-18T11:58:00.000Z	fangorious	bodaciousb	you have to give it the PID from the prior ps command
2006-01-18T12:10:00.000Z	bodaciousb	fangorious	i dont think that bot is in here
2006-01-18T12:11:00.000Z	fangorious	bodaciousb	that work?
2006-01-18T12:11:00.000Z	bodaciousb	fangorious	yeah, thanks
2006-01-18T12:13:00.000Z	bodaciousb	fangorious	that whole time all i had to do was sudo nvidia-glx-config enable
