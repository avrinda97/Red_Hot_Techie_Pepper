2008-01-10T15:47:00.000Z	ikonia	Gudril	did you do a server install
2008-01-10T15:45:00.000Z	ikonia	Gudril	have you done a server install
2008-01-10T15:47:00.000Z	ikonia	Gudril	use the desktop version, there is no reason for you to use the server version
2008-01-10T15:48:00.000Z	ikonia	Gudril	install the desktop cd - not the server one
2008-01-10T15:48:00.000Z	ikonia	Gudril	the desktop version will do all you want it to do and have better gui intergration
2008-01-10T15:49:00.000Z	ikonia	Gudril	you'll find it better to install the desktop cd
2008-01-10T15:49:00.000Z	ikonia	Gudril	I assure you it will make things easier in the long run
2008-01-10T15:50:00.000Z	Gudril	ikonia	i dont like the easy way =) i would learn and why not do it now? xD
2008-01-10T15:51:00.000Z	ikonia	Gudril	well your not really learning - your just asking what to do. I strongly advise you to use the desktop CD as it is a better fit for your purpose
2008-01-10T15:55:00.000Z	ikonia	Gudril	I strongly advise you to install the ubuntu-desktop cd
2008-01-10T16:38:00.000Z	ikonia	Gudril	install the desktop cd - that is the tool you need
2008-01-10T16:39:00.000Z	Gudril	ikonia	gnome is ready =)
2008-01-10T16:39:00.000Z	ikonia	Gudril	no - gnome desktop is ready, the gnome intergration and environment is not
