2005-02-27T16:40:00.000Z	neiras		Oh, also, there are 2 modules that fail loading (This is Warty) on every machine I've installed it on
2005-02-27T16:40:00.000Z	neiras		And the boot splash doesn't work
2005-02-27T16:40:00.000Z	neiras		oh, ok
2005-02-27T16:40:00.000Z	neiras		assumed there would be
2005-02-27T16:41:00.000Z	neiras		Compatibility concerns?
2005-02-27T16:41:00.000Z	neiras		I heard Ubuntu was working on a kick-ass bootsplash thing that had transitions and other eye candy
2005-02-27T16:41:00.000Z	neiras		everyone was all thrilled
2005-02-27T16:42:00.000Z	neiras		Ubuntu's really bringing some much-needed polish into things
2005-02-27T16:42:00.000Z	neiras		great to see
2005-02-27T16:42:00.000Z	neiras		or gensplash
2005-02-27T16:42:00.000Z	sladen	neiras	you can play with the v1 demo code.  http://www.paul.sladen.org/projects/usplash/download/  but the v2 code didn't make it for Hoary
2005-02-27T16:43:00.000Z	neiras	sladen	thanks... I'll grab that tonight and have a look
2005-02-27T16:53:00.000Z	sladen	neiras	you don't need to relocate to work for Canonical
2005-02-27T16:53:00.000Z	neiras	sladen	Well, if I relocate can I still work there? I need a change in pace :)
2005-02-27T16:54:00.000Z	sladen	neiras	everyone working for Canonical works from home, which ever country they're in
2005-02-27T16:55:00.000Z	neiras	sladen	That's neat... I'm going to get my CV together and send it in for consideration.
2005-02-27T16:56:00.000Z	neiras	sladen	Canonical's doing the kind of stuff I always dreamed of starting a company to do. ;)
2005-02-27T16:57:00.000Z	sladen	neiras	you can work on Ubuntu without working for Canonical.  ...I sometimes manage that when I remember
2005-02-27T16:57:00.000Z	neiras	sladen	Yeah, I am just working on getting a feel for the Ubuntu community and projects... I'll be doing that regardless I think, but I'd love to do it full time
2005-02-27T16:58:00.000Z	neiras	sladen	Eating is important
2005-02-28T17:08:00.000Z	neiras	sladen	- he's trying to boot into a system using the install cd, not getting that error after grub
