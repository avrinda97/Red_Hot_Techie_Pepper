2005-04-09T10:44:00.000Z	Dreamer3	desrt	thinking of buying a mini-itx via 5000 system... wondering what it would run well
2005-04-09T10:44:00.000Z	Dreamer3	desrt	*laughs* well, want to keep the price reasonable :) it's only 566mhz
2005-04-09T10:45:00.000Z	Dreamer3	desrt	yes
2005-04-09T10:45:00.000Z	Dreamer3	desrt	i want to find a distro/set of apps that runs FAST :)
2005-04-09T10:45:00.000Z	Dreamer3	desrt	i'm liking the idea of a PC with 0 moving parts
2005-04-09T10:46:00.000Z	Dreamer3	desrt	yeah, downloading now
2005-04-09T10:46:00.000Z	Dreamer3	desrt	to try on this 64mb system

2005-04-09T10:47:00.000Z	Dreamer3	desrt	*laughs*
2005-04-09T10:47:00.000Z	Dreamer3	desrt	why? wear it out?
2005-04-09T10:47:00.000Z	Dreamer3	desrt	well, faster than all your apps crashing cause you have no memory at all, right? :)
2005-04-09T10:47:00.000Z	Dreamer3	desrt	but... ubuntu wouldn't work on a 512mb flash card :)
2005-04-09T10:48:00.000Z	Dreamer3	desrt	and if i go for a 4g microdrive, then i have moving parts :)
2005-04-09T10:48:00.000Z	Dreamer3	desrt	though i wonder if those are quiet
2005-04-09T10:49:00.000Z	Dreamer3	desrt	i want the system to be stand-alone :)
2005-04-09T10:51:00.000Z	Dreamer3	desrt	so just buckle up and order overseas?
2005-04-09T10:52:00.000Z	Dreamer3	desrt	i wish newegg has this stuff
