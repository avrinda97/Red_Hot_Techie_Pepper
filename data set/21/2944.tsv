2009-05-13T01:53:00.000Z	evanrmurphy		Hi all, quick question: is there any way to make the FUSA ignore applications like Pidgin and Empathy? I'd prefer it remain just for shutting down and switching users than try to integrate my IM presence status. Thanks in advance!

2009-05-13T01:56:00.000Z	ienorand	evanrmurphy	it is yes, hang on....
2009-05-13T01:56:00.000Z	evanrmurphy	ienorand	Thank you.

2009-05-13T02:00:00.000Z	evanrmurphy	ienorand	Lemme try it out. Get back to you in a sec...
2009-05-13T02:04:00.000Z	evanrmurphy	ienorand	Hmmm... doesn't seem to have any effects yet. I'll continue messing with it...
2009-05-13T02:05:00.000Z	ienorand	evanrmurphy	you did want to disable fusa using shutdown/logout menu right?
2009-05-13T02:06:00.000Z	ienorand	evanrmurphy	that should be just unticking /apps/fast-user-switch-applet/show_presence_info in gconf, that worked for me....
2009-05-13T02:09:00.000Z	evanrmurphy	ienorand	To rephrase, FUSA normally shows the inconic "turn off" button, and only has choices to switch users or shut down. When I open Pidgin or Empathy, it gains all these additional options to control my presence status in those programs, and the default icon it shows in the upper-righthand corner is my status icon for that program. I'd simply like it to be unaffected be those programs, continuing to show the basic swi
2009-05-13T02:09:00.000Z	evanrmurphy		tch user and shutdown options, but not attempt to integrate with Pidgin or similar applications. Not sure I had explained that clearly before, is this what you thought I meant?
2009-05-13T02:11:00.000Z	ienorand	evanrmurphy	Yes, follow you there... and does not unticking _/apps/fast-user-switch-applet/show_presence_info_ in gconf work fo you then? (run gconf-editor in terminal)
2009-05-13T02:14:00.000Z	evanrmurphy	ienorand	Unchecking the box doesn't seem to help. When I restart Empathy, it still changes FUSA. When I check back at gconf-editor again, the box is still unchecked. Maybe I should restart X...
2009-05-13T02:15:00.000Z	ienorand	evanrmurphy	oh, by the way, you should not be using sudo/gksudo...
2009-05-13T02:16:00.000Z	ienorand	evanrmurphy	since gksudo starts gconf for root and edits root's settings, but not your's, I think.
2009-05-13T02:19:00.000Z	evanrmurphy	ienorand	That did the trick, strangely enough! I went back into gksudo gconf-editor and re-checked the box; left it unchecked in non-gksudo gconf-editor, and now the status options aren't there anymore. It still changes the icon shown by default in the corner from the shutdown icon to my presence, have you gotten it to stop that as well?
2009-05-13T02:19:00.000Z	evanrmurphy	ienorand	I suppose they warned in the forum you linked that it would still show the different icon. :-/
2009-05-13T02:21:00.000Z	ienorand	evanrmurphy	yea it shows the door thingy for me to.
2009-05-13T02:22:00.000Z	evanrmurphy	ienorand	Well this is one step better. I'll dig around to see if that can be disabled as well. Thanks for your help.
