2009-10-08T20:35:00.000Z	VCoolio		how can I edit a .so file?
2009-10-08T20:35:00.000Z	grawity	VCoolio	By editing the original source code and recompiling.
2009-10-08T20:36:00.000Z	VCoolio	grawity	that's a little bit impossible in this case; could I also download the .deb and edit in there?
2009-10-08T20:36:00.000Z	grawity	VCoolio	.deb files usually don't have the source.
2009-10-08T20:37:00.000Z	grawity	VCoolio	A .so is a Linux shared library, in binary form - you can only edit it with a hex editor, which is mostly useless if you didn't write the library.
2009-10-08T20:38:00.000Z	VCoolio	grawity	I get a python error somewhere, with lines and everything, and I know what I must change :(
2009-10-08T20:38:00.000Z	grawity	VCoolio	If it's Python, it can't be a .so :|
2009-10-08T20:38:00.000Z	grawity	VCoolio	Eh, just try opening it with a text editor.
2009-10-08T20:38:00.000Z	VCoolio	grawity	tried, but I only get smilies and squares and stuff
2009-10-08T20:39:00.000Z	grawity	VCoolio	What _exactly_ are you trying to run?
2009-10-08T20:40:00.000Z	VCoolio	grawity	shellementary (e17 port of zenity) and I get this, so the .so was my mistake, different file; where do I find this:  File "build/bdist.linux-i686/egg/elementary/c_elementary.py", line 7, in <module>
2009-10-08T20:40:00.000Z	grawity	VCoolio	Then $EDITOR build/bdist.linux-i686/egg/elementary/c_elementary.py
2009-10-08T20:41:00.000Z	VCoolio	grawity	the path is not right this way; where should I look?
2009-10-12T19:41:00.000Z	grawity	VCoolio	Maybe you disabled it?
2009-10-12T19:42:00.000Z	grawity	VCoolio	View -> Location Selector ->
2009-10-12T19:43:00.000Z	VCoolio	grawity	when I have ubuntu language setting on dutch there is no location bar option ?!? only thing I change is language setting then this happens with thunar
2009-11-18T22:02:00.000Z	grawity	VCoolio	Sharing works as long as you have read perms, AFAIK
2010-01-03T00:53:00.000Z	grawity	VCoolio	For irssi, http://sprunge.us/cGcE may be useful.
2010-01-03T00:59:00.000Z	VCoolio	grawity	sorry, but what is it? irssi script or something I need my terminal to be aware of?
2010-01-03T01:00:00.000Z	grawity	VCoolio	an irssi script, sets window title... Might not be very useful, but I like it.
2010-01-03T01:00:00.000Z	VCoolio	grawity	ok, I'll give it a shot, thankx
