2005-03-19T08:39:00.000Z	helio7		any ideas why the Qtparted app on the "systemrescueCd" would only allow someone to partition their primary HDD and not a 2ndary one?
2005-03-19T08:40:00.000Z	eyequeue	helio7	 do you perhaps have to start it with an hdb argument, like with 'fdisk hdb' ?
2005-03-19T08:40:00.000Z	helio7	eyequeue	good idea, i'm a fairly new-to-linux user trying to help out a friend who's trying it for the first time
2005-03-19T08:41:00.000Z	eyequeue	helio7	 i don't know definititely, just a suggestion
2005-04-04T10:05:00.000Z	helio7	eyequeue	thanks
2005-04-04T10:01:00.000Z	eyequeue	helio7	 i've done so, via something or other i read on ubuntuguide
2005-04-04T10:01:00.000Z	helio7	eyequeue	ok I'll keep looking then thanks (=
2005-04-04T10:01:00.000Z	eyequeue	helio7	 should be simple to find there, though i don't recall specifics
2005-04-04T10:02:00.000Z	helio7	eyequeue	so you can hear the music here? http://www.morrisseymusic.com/quicktime/1.html
2005-04-04T10:03:00.000Z	eyequeue	helio7	 say my name again?
2005-04-04T10:04:00.000Z	eyequeue	helio7	 i don't hear it, but i think i have no sound now :/
2005-04-04T10:05:00.000Z	helio7	eyequeue	lol well you don't see the jigsaw piece suggesting a missing plugin (= right?
2005-04-04T10:05:00.000Z	eyequeue	helio7	 it does fire up mplayer though, which says* it is playing rtsp://(long thing here).mov
2005-04-04T10:05:00.000Z	eyequeue	helio7	 right, it seems my sound is borked, since i dind't here xchat tell me you said my nick either
2005-04-04T10:06:00.000Z	eyequeue	helio7	 all indications are that i'd hear it there, if sound worked ... i'll ... gasp, reboot now
2005-04-07T09:11:00.000Z	eyequeue	helio7	 there is a lockfile you can rm under your old profile, under ~/.mozilla/firefox/
2005-04-07T09:12:00.000Z	helio7	eyequeue	ahh thanks that makes sense... because of thecrash the lockfile says the profile's still in use right?
2005-04-07T09:12:00.000Z	eyequeue	helio7	 quit ff and compare the two dirs, the filename should be obvious, i don't recall it offhand
2005-04-07T09:12:00.000Z	eyequeue	helio7	 exactly
2005-04-07T09:18:00.000Z	eyequeue	helio7	 great
