2006-12-13T16:46:00.000Z	bimberi	crowley1027	are you installing offline (no net connection)?
2006-12-13T16:47:00.000Z	bimberi	crowley1027	'sudo apt-get install rtorrent' and any uninstalled dependencies will be installed as well
2006-12-13T16:49:00.000Z	bimberi	crowley1027	it's in the universe repository...
2006-12-14T17:05:00.000Z	bimberi	crowley1027	'sudo apt-get install build-essential' (as per arrenlex)
2006-12-14T17:07:00.000Z	bimberi	crowley1027	type 'sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list' and copy and paste the contents of that file to a pastebin site ...
2006-12-14T17:07:00.000Z	bimberi	crowley1027	not intended to be.  it was to give you the URL of the pastebin
2006-12-14T17:08:00.000Z	bimberi	crowley1027	yes, but I didn't know that you know :)
2006-12-14T17:13:00.000Z	crowley1027	bimberi	 This is from trying to install libtorrent - - - -   http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36907/
2006-12-14T17:14:00.000Z	bimberi	crowley1027	why are you compiling? rtorrent can be installed without needing to compile anything.  Enable the universe repository and then install it.  Or do you need a later version or something?
2006-12-14T17:25:00.000Z	crowley1027	bimberi	i'm confused on how to enable the universe thing.  can you just walk me thru it?
2006-12-14T17:45:00.000Z	bimberi	crowley1027	read the ... manual
2006-12-14T06:50:00.000Z	bimberi	crowley1027	getting the hang of linux eh? :)
2006-12-20T09:00:00.000Z	bimberi	crowley1027	so it doesn't power off?
2006-12-20T09:00:00.000Z	crowley1027	bimberi	nope
2006-12-20T09:00:00.000Z	bimberi	crowley1027	yes, as malikeye is saying (but not using your nick)
2006-12-20T09:01:00.000Z	crowley1027	bimberi	is there any total diagnostic that i can run for my system?
2006-12-20T09:02:00.000Z	bimberi	crowley1027	not an all-encompassing one - that i know of
2006-12-20T09:03:00.000Z	crowley1027	bimberi	is there a diagnostic that i can check core system files to see if \anything is corupt?
2006-12-20T09:03:00.000Z	bimberi	crowley1027	if 'sudo apt-get -f install' doesn't do much then that's a good sign
