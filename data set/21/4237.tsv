2008-06-30T19:23:00.000Z	ASULutzy	m3talgod	Use the pastebin link.
2008-06-30T19:25:00.000Z	ASULutzy	m3talgod	You need to copy the link it gives you.
2008-06-30T19:26:00.000Z	ASULutzy	m3talgod	You need to go to the pastebin URL, paste the output, then give us the link that it spits out.
2008-06-30T19:27:00.000Z	ASULutzy	m3talgod	What is the name of your wireless card?
2008-06-30T19:28:00.000Z	ASULutzy	m3talgod	I think those might have broadcoms. Try lspci | grep Broad
2008-06-30T19:29:00.000Z	ASULutzy	m3talgod	You have the same wireless card as me :)
2008-06-30T19:29:00.000Z	ASULutzy	m3talgod	You'll need to setup ndiswrapper. First click applications then accessories, then terminal, then type sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get install ndisgtk
2008-06-30T19:31:00.000Z	ASULutzy	m3talgod	Now all you need to do is wget http://myspamb8.googlepages.com/R174291-pruned.zip && unzip R174291-pruned.zip
2008-06-30T19:33:00.000Z	ASULutzy	m3talgod	Once you do that, you'll want to click system -> Windows Wireless Drivers, and tell ndisgtk to use the driver you just unzipped (it'll be in like /home/$USER/R17....)
2008-06-30T19:36:00.000Z	ASULutzy	m3talgod	Yea, if you're really lucky network manager will automatically give you a list of all the WAP's that it sees
2008-06-30T19:36:00.000Z	ASULutzy	m3talgod	No problem :)
