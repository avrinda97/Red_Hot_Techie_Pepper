2011-04-29T00:04:00.000Z	fritsch	aravinda	if this does not work, killing pulseaudio and restarting would be an idea.

2011-04-29T00:05:00.000Z	fritsch	aravinda	afterwards pulseaudio -d

2011-04-29T00:08:00.000Z	fritsch	aravinda	nskype does not change any system settings concerning audio
2011-04-29T00:09:00.000Z	aravinda	fritsch	:that may be the reason
