2011-02-22T02:01:00.000Z	sincir		hey there! i' m trying to get xcompmgr running together with my windowmanager, but whenever i run xcompmgr in a terminal emulator as normal user, it runs, but "locks" the terminal and when i close the terminal emulator, xcompgmr automatically stops, now i don't know how i can get xcompmgr running without sudo...is there any help for me?
2011-02-22T02:02:00.000Z	ohsix	sincir	xcompmgr was pretty much just a demo, is there any reason you still use it?
2011-02-22T02:03:00.000Z	sincir	ohsix	1.) openbox needs it to have some eyecandy (that i REALLY need ;)) 2.) i don't know any alternative yet, you have a hint for me?
2011-02-22T02:04:00.000Z	ohsix	sincir	ah if you're using it with openbox you'll probably need to keep doing it, the alternatives are different window managers
2011-02-22T02:05:00.000Z	ohsix	sincir	compiz, metacity has compositing built in now (based off xcompmgr) kwin ha some stuff, generally any overlapping window manager that's still maintained does some form of compositing
2011-02-22T02:05:00.000Z	sincir	ohsix	but i'm sure my problem is just some childish rights problem, right?
2011-02-22T02:05:00.000Z	ohsix	sincir	compiz is the go-to eyecandy choice tho
2011-02-22T02:05:00.000Z	sincir	ohsix	no, compiz is too much of a load to just have a transparent terminal...
2011-02-22T02:06:00.000Z	ohsix	sincir	i dunno, running it as root is never right, you probably have some files in your home dir or /tmp that got their permission changed by using sudo; and as a regular user it can't connect
2011-02-22T02:06:00.000Z	sincir	ohsix	which config files in ~ does xcompmgr need to read? Xdefaults?
2011-02-22T02:07:00.000Z	ohsix	sincir	the .ICEauthority and some others that it gets credentials from to connect to the server
2011-02-22T02:07:00.000Z	ohsix	sincir	just checking that they're owned by you should be sufficient to see whats going on
2011-02-22T02:08:00.000Z	sincir	ohsix	is it really ok to have .ICEauthority readable for any user?
2011-02-22T02:09:00.000Z	ohsix	sincir	no, it's supposed to be for you, they're your credentials
2011-02-22T02:09:00.000Z	ohsix	sincir	looks like this here -rw------- 1 ohsix ohsix 3454 2011-02-17 12:07 /home/ohsix/.ICEauthority
2011-02-22T02:10:00.000Z	sincir	ohsix	by "any" i mean "me" (atm it's just -rw-------)
2011-02-22T02:10:00.000Z	ohsix	sincir	as long as it says you own it then it's not a problem
2011-02-22T02:10:00.000Z	sincir	ohsix	it looks just like yours: -rw------- 1 ohsix ohsix 3454 2011-02-17 12:07 /home/ohsix/.ICEauthority - so i don't have to change anything?
2011-02-22T02:20:00.000Z	sincir	ohsix	btw, do you know if Awesome WM has already a built in xcompmgr?
2011-02-22T02:21:00.000Z	ohsix	sincir	nope, no clue; i pretty much mentioned all the ones i knew personally by name already
2011-02-22T02:22:00.000Z	sincir	ohsix	ok, will test it another time, thx for the help so far
