2012-01-18T16:07:00.000Z	mbutubuntu		hello folks, where is the X conf file on Ubuntu 10.04 ?!
2012-01-18T16:08:00.000Z	ikonia	mbutubuntu	it's removed as it's dynamic
2012-01-18T16:11:00.000Z	mbutubuntu	ikonia	I've a problem with Video playing... I have a dual-head configuration and I haven't updated any package but yesterday I see "cutted" videos on the big (Full HD) Monitor. It seems that viewable size with vlc (and all players, ffplay too) is less than the whole screen.
2012-01-18T16:12:00.000Z	mbutubuntu		xsessiox-errors doesn't give me any useful information so I don't know how to solve this problem
2012-01-18T16:13:00.000Z	mbutubuntu	ikonia	even if dynamic I think exist any utility or [temp]file in which I can see the problem.... ! I've used this Ubuntu configuration for months but yesterday appered the problem
2012-01-18T16:14:00.000Z	ikonia	mbutubuntu	what ?
2012-01-18T16:15:00.000Z	mbutubuntu	ikonia	what problem? about a third of the second screen is viewable, but not viewable with videos... I haven't compiz.
2012-01-18T16:16:00.000Z	ikonia	mbutubuntu	I have no idea what you are talking about, I've not been talking to you / helping you
2012-01-18T16:18:00.000Z	mbutubuntu	ikonia	you're right but you said that the Screen configuration is dynamic. I can't think there is no way to watch the configuration...!
2012-01-18T16:18:00.000Z	ikonia	mbutubuntu	it will read the file if it's there, if not it goes to dynamic
2012-01-18T16:18:00.000Z	ikonia	mbutubuntu	just create a file in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2012-01-18T16:19:00.000Z	mbutubuntu	ikonia	ooohhh, so the conffile is always /etc/x11/xorg.conf... wonderful
2012-01-18T16:19:00.000Z	ikonia	mbutubuntu	if you create a file in that location it will get read
2012-01-18T16:19:00.000Z	ikonia	mbutubuntu	/etc/X11/xorg.conf
2012-01-18T16:19:00.000Z	ikonia	mbutubuntu	note the "X" in X11
2012-01-18T16:20:00.000Z	mbutubuntu	ikonia	yes the X is uppcase
2012-01-18T16:36:00.000Z	mbutubuntu		how to know what video driver is using X ?
2012-01-18T16:36:00.000Z	ikonia	mbutubuntu	it's in the log
2012-01-18T16:37:00.000Z	mbutubuntu		.xsession-erros ?
