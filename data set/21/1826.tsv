2010-04-20T04:08:00.000Z	joshdreamland		Can anyone tell me how to allocate more space for persistent files on my Live USB?
2010-04-20T04:08:00.000Z	joshdreamland		Using 9.10, AMD 64
2010-04-20T04:10:00.000Z	joshdreamland		I've made a couple changes I'd not much like to lose; isn't there a command line to just add more space to the persistent account?
2010-04-20T04:12:00.000Z	joshdreamland		I opened it in GParted; there was only one partition and it was roughly half full
2010-04-20T04:12:00.000Z	switch10_	joshdreamland	just backup, reinstall on the USB, and then restore..
2010-04-20T04:15:00.000Z	joshdreamland	switch10_	can you back up without backing up partition size, too?
2010-04-20T04:15:00.000Z	switch10_	joshdreamland	of course.  backing up /home should be good enough to save your settings..
2010-04-21T07:46:00.000Z	switch10_	joshdreamland	I've done it on an 8gb flash disk..  are you giving the disk persistent storage space?
2010-04-21T07:47:00.000Z	joshdreamland	switch10_	Doing so from Jaunty creates the disk, but fails to make it persistent. And yes, I tried giving it the entire drive. It never asks me how much to use on Karmic, because it can't find a partition it considers acceptable.
2010-04-21T07:47:00.000Z	switch10_	joshdreamland	it is formated as fat32?
2010-04-21T07:48:00.000Z	joshdreamland	switch10_	When I format it as fat32, it is recognized, but it says it requires formatting. Telling it to proceed with the format causes it to drop the partition and remove the drive from the list.
2010-04-21T07:50:00.000Z	switch10_	joshdreamland	that is normal.  it should unmount it to format it, and then continue with the install.
2010-04-21T07:50:00.000Z	joshdreamland	switch10_	To clarify, any formatting must be done with GParted; having usb-creator do it causes the partition to be dropped and the drive removed from its list
2010-04-21T07:51:00.000Z	switch10_	joshdreamland	hmm, that is odd.  I don't know why it would do that..  You could always do it manually...
2010-04-21T07:51:00.000Z	joshdreamland	switch10_	Do which part manually? USB disk creation or formatting?
2010-04-21T07:52:00.000Z	switch10_	joshdreamland	the USB disk creation.  there is a how to on google somewhere i'll see if I can find it..
2010-04-21T07:52:00.000Z	joshdreamland	switch10_	also, it has ceased to remove it from the list; now it just formats it in a manner that is not to its liking and leaves the warning sign next to it
2010-04-21T07:55:00.000Z	switch10_	joshdreamland	the tut i saw was not architecture dependant.  basically just copying files..
2010-04-21T08:05:00.000Z	switch10_	joshdreamland	sorry, im still looking...
2010-04-21T08:05:00.000Z	joshdreamland	switch10_	I'm going to give portablelinux a shot
2010-04-21T08:06:00.000Z	switch10_	joshdreamland	FYI portable linux did not work for me, but try it.  Here is that link http://www.debuntu.org/how-to-install-ubuntu-linux-on-usb-bar
