2006-04-02T07:53:00.000Z	Khaaaaan	useruser	It says I can't read it "in it's current state", then something about plugins
2006-04-02T08:06:00.000Z	useruser	Khaaaaan	did you install it
2006-04-02T08:34:00.000Z	useruser	Khaaaaan	it's a hard problem, i think
2006-04-02T08:34:00.000Z	Khaaaaan	useruser	But is it possible?
2006-04-02T08:34:00.000Z	useruser	Khaaaaan	probably not

2006-04-02T08:36:00.000Z	useruser	Khaaaaan	are you trying to open a pdf?
2006-04-02T08:37:00.000Z	useruser	Khaaaaan	because acrobat 6.0 for linux now exists
2006-04-02T08:37:00.000Z	useruser	Khaaaaan	 you could try that
