2005-07-09T10:03:00.000Z	jamey3		ditto
2005-07-09T10:04:00.000Z	jamey3		oh I see...
2005-07-09T10:04:00.000Z	jamey3		why the hell is ubuntuguide linked to from the official site?
2005-07-09T10:04:00.000Z	Strife	jamey3	because it's not *bad*, it's just not a good place for in-depth informaiton
2005-07-09T10:05:00.000Z	jamey3		wtf though, if the Wiki is better, just recommend there
2005-07-09T10:05:00.000Z	jamey3		take down bloody ubuntuguide.org
2005-07-09T10:05:00.000Z	jamey3		it's a menace!"
2005-07-09T10:05:00.000Z	jamey3		j/k
2005-07-09T10:05:00.000Z	Strife		meh
2005-07-09T10:05:00.000Z	Strife		I say, if a shorter thing can help you at first, you may as well look there to begin with
2005-07-09T10:05:00.000Z	Strife		the wiki is great for more in depth stuff
2005-07-09T10:06:00.000Z	Strife		but the guide is good for just getting started with things
2005-07-09T10:06:00.000Z	jamey3		but if it presents misguided or "wrong" instructions, newbies are hurting themselves
2005-07-09T10:06:00.000Z	jamey3		(like myself!)
2005-07-09T10:06:00.000Z	Strife	jamey3	right
2005-07-09T10:06:00.000Z	jamey3		lol you don't have to
2005-07-09T10:07:00.000Z	jamey3		true
2005-07-09T10:07:00.000Z	jamey3		anyway, can someone help me...
2005-07-09T10:07:00.000Z	Strife	jamey3	honestly, I only recommend it for people who have linux experience already, because then they actually know what the commands it tells you to do are doing
2005-07-09T10:07:00.000Z	jamey3		I want a default sources.list
2005-07-09T10:07:00.000Z	jamey3	Strife	I understand every command on ubuntuguide.org... but I still consider myself a newbie
