2011-02-05T06:09:00.000Z	KG	jrib	Sorry, habit. But since then, GStreamer can't find any plugins but the core elements like fakesrc/sink. When I use gst-inspect, only 20 elements are listed. However, /usr/libs/gstreamer-0.10 is filled with all the plugin .so's that GStreamer can't find.
2011-02-05T06:13:00.000Z	jrib	KG	hmm, I don't remember much about gstreamer... But, what does this return: which gst-inspect
2011-02-05T06:14:00.000Z	KG	jrib	It lists all of the plugins and GStreamer elements that it finds.
2011-02-05T06:14:00.000Z	jrib	KG	nah, I mean what does the command « which gst-inspect » return?  (I'm checking if you installed stuff to /usr/local/)
2011-02-05T06:15:00.000Z	KG	jrib	hah, sorry, somehow missed the which. It shows /usr/local/bin/gst-inspect
2011-02-05T06:16:00.000Z	jrib	KG	so my hunch was right :P  Why do you have it in /usr/local/?
2011-02-05T06:17:00.000Z	KG	jrib	No idea? I haven't changed it since it's been install. Supposedly it came with 10.10.
2011-02-05T06:18:00.000Z	jrib	KG	hmm, official packages won't install anything to /usr/local/.  Stuff usually ends up in there through some "./configure; make; make install" dance
2011-02-05T06:19:00.000Z	KG	jrib	Oh geez, must have been when I thought writing a custom GStreamer plugin was the solution to my problem, so I tried to build from source. :X Completely forgot about that. Anyway to remove?
2011-02-05T06:20:00.000Z	jrib	KG	sometimes authors will provide an "uninstall" rule, so you can try « make uninstall » in the same place you ran « make install ».  Otherwise just use rm in /usr/local/ (this is easy if all you have in there is gstreamer :))
2011-02-05T06:24:00.000Z	KG	jrib	Well it was the only thing in there so I did rm -rf *. Now gst-inspect-0.10 (the only available gst-inspect) is located in /usr/bin and still only has 20 items. Is this another silly mistake on my part?
2011-02-05T06:26:00.000Z	jrib	KG	try deleting ~/.gstreamer-0.10/*.bin
2011-02-05T06:29:00.000Z	KG	jrib	You're probably overwhelmed by all the other people asking questions, sorry :/ Deleted ~/.gstreamer-0.10/, still the same situation it seems.
2011-02-05T06:31:00.000Z	jrib	KG	are you running "gst-inspect" or "gst-inspect-0.10"?
2011-02-05T06:31:00.000Z	KG	jrib	at this point, there is no gst-inspect. Just gst-inspect-0.10
2011-02-05T06:35:00.000Z	jrib	KG	and « which gst-inspect-0.10 » now returns the /usr/bin one?
2011-02-05T06:36:00.000Z	KG	jrib	Yep, that's the case.
2011-02-05T06:36:00.000Z	jrib	KG	hmm, try reinstalling the relevant packages before we spend more time troubleshooting?
2011-02-05T06:37:00.000Z	KG	jrib	Yeah, hope I wouldn't have to but that's what I get for being silly
