2009-10-17T04:09:00.000Z	pejo_		What package contains the iso-8859-1 locales in Ubuntu 9.04?
2009-10-17T04:10:00.000Z	vlt	pejo_	"locales" I think
2009-10-17T04:10:00.000Z	pejo_	vlt	if i dpkg-reconfigure locales I only get UTF-8 ones, and C. Do I need to do something else?
2009-10-17T04:11:00.000Z	vlt	pejo_	`locale-gen iso-8859-1`?
2009-10-17T04:12:00.000Z	vlt	pejo_	But I don't know how to "activate" it if `dpkg-reconfigure` doen't work ...
2009-10-17T04:12:00.000Z	pejo_	vlt	any idea why someone made it so hard to get the iso-8859-1 stuff? There seems to be plenty of UTF-8 stuff.
2009-10-17T04:14:00.000Z	pejo_	vlt	ah! locale-gen sv_SE. Thank youj!
2009-10-17T04:19:00.000Z	pejo_	vlt	I'm going to sound like a crazy man here but I just installed ubuntu and it seems I can only ssh to each host once. After I've been connected to them and disconnect they stop responding to ping. Other servers that I haven't connected to still responds.
2009-10-17T04:21:00.000Z	vlt	pejo_	Don't connect to my server then ;-)
2009-10-17T04:22:00.000Z	pejo_	vlt	heh, ok - I'll be careful so I don't take out all of internet.
2009-10-17T04:23:00.000Z	vlt	pejo_	Name an example of a server not responding to your ping.
2009-10-17T04:24:00.000Z	pejo_	vlt	dexter.ludd.ltu.se
2009-10-17T04:25:00.000Z	vlt	pejo_	It's answering my pings
2009-10-17T04:26:00.000Z	pejo_	vlt	I realize the machine is up, and I connected just fine to it minutes ago.
2009-10-17T04:27:00.000Z	vlt	pejo_	ssh has a -v option
2009-10-17T04:28:00.000Z	pejo_	vlt	yes, it gets to "Connecting to dexter.ludd.ltu.se ..port 22." and then nothing.
2009-10-17T04:32:00.000Z	vlt	pejo_	Can you ping other hosts?
2009-10-17T04:32:00.000Z	pejo_	vlt	yes, www.ludd.ltu.se works for example. (Haven't connected there)
2009-10-17T04:34:00.000Z	vlt	pejo_	You can ping www.... but not dexter...?!?
2009-10-17T04:34:00.000Z	vlt	pejo_	What if you type the IP manually?
2009-10-17T04:36:00.000Z	pejo_	vlt	that works. When i type "host dexter" I get the ip back reversed.
