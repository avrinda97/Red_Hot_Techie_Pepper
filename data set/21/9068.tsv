2006-01-05T08:57:00.000Z	pat		i have a boot cd of ubuntu
2006-01-05T08:59:00.000Z	pat		what you mean: alot?
2006-01-05T08:59:00.000Z	pilgrim	pat	try that cd and open a terminal and then do grub-install /dev/hda
2006-01-05T09:02:00.000Z	pilgrim	pat	did you try what I said above?
2006-01-05T09:04:00.000Z	pilgrim	pat	you can just go to applications>accessorises right?
2006-01-05T09:05:00.000Z	pilgrim	pat	good luck
2006-01-05T09:10:00.000Z	pat	pilgrim	i've just explored the disk; the only files with grub.. i can find are on \pool\main\g\grub and \pool\main\g\grub-installer . The disk contains an iso image. I've got it from a magazine, without additional comment.
2006-01-05T09:11:00.000Z	pat	pilgrim	the directories contain DEB-files
2006-01-05T09:11:00.000Z	pilgrim	pat	I guess those will do.  Have you the plain ubuntu CD?
2006-01-05T09:11:00.000Z	pilgrim	pat	or the "install" CD?
2006-01-05T09:13:00.000Z	pat	pilgrim	i do not now how i could run a DEB file. the only thing i can do is to run the cd as boot-cd
2006-01-05T09:14:00.000Z	pilgrim	pat	well the  grub-install was not a DEB file
2006-01-05T09:14:00.000Z	pilgrim	pat	right?
2006-01-05T09:14:00.000Z	pilgrim	pat	it that's the case then do "\pool\main\g\grub-installer /dev/hda"
2006-01-05T09:14:00.000Z	pilgrim	pat	OH!
2006-01-05T09:15:00.000Z	pilgrim	pat	so it was \pool\main\g\grub-installer.deb not plain grub-install?
2006-01-05T09:16:00.000Z	pilgrim	pat	well. that sucks...oh...try and see if you can mount your partition (ubuntu install)
2006-01-05T09:17:00.000Z	pilgrim	pat	once you do that then do <mount point> /sbin/grub-install /dev/hda
2006-01-05T09:18:00.000Z	pilgrim	pat	it needs other stuff to.. I have no idea what but I'm pretty sure it does need other stuff.
