2010-11-09T00:43:00.000Z	pwnt	Stereocaulon	I'm using 10.10, and still getting problems while updating or installing drivers, for example now I'm installing drivers, wireless + graphic card, but look I get this error
2010-11-09T00:44:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	pwnt	could you please repeat the error you get? (if it's longer than one line, please provide a suitable link ta a pastebin)
2010-11-09T00:45:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	pwnt	ta => to
2010-11-09T00:45:00.000Z	pwnt	Stereocaulon	you want the error from driver install, or from apt-get update?
2010-11-09T00:45:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	pwnt	anything that's relevant to the the malfunction you are experiencing.
2010-11-09T00:46:00.000Z	pwnt	Stereocaulon	Failed to fetch http://kw.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/restricted/f/fglrx-installer/fglrx_8.780-0ubuntu2_amd64.deb Hash Sum mismatch
2010-11-09T00:46:00.000Z	pwnt	Stereocaulon	that while trying to install graphic card
2010-11-09T00:47:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	pwnt	that error means that the package it's trying to get is damaged or not in a form that the installer expects it's to be.
2010-11-09T00:48:00.000Z	pwnt	Stereocaulon	then how can I install my grapphic card
2010-11-09T00:49:00.000Z	pwnt	Stereocaulon	what about this error on the 'sudo apt-get update' http://pastebin.com/aKHvWyRv
2010-11-09T00:51:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	pwnt	to remedy the last error, just remove the install CD from valid software sources, so Ubuntu will only check online resoureces instead
2010-11-09T00:51:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	pwnt	sorry about my spelling, my keyboard is a bit glitched...
2010-11-09T00:52:00.000Z	pwnt	Stereocaulon	don't worry about your spelling, all my installations are not cool right now, nothing is working
2010-11-09T00:53:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	pwnt	so that also means you have no network connectivity yet?
2010-11-09T00:54:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	pwnt	true, but you could have used another computer to do that.
2010-11-09T00:54:00.000Z	pwnt	Stereocaulon	yea, but I'm not. something is wrong, I think its my repositories\
2010-11-09T00:55:00.000Z	pwnt	Stereocaulon	how to take screenshot in ubuntu, I want to show you an image too.
2010-11-09T00:55:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	pwnt	the last error you pastebined occurs when you have two programs running simultaneously that are using your software installation sources (like Synaptic and Software chooser)
2010-11-09T01:07:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	pwnt	just use xkill and point to the offending window >Zap!<
