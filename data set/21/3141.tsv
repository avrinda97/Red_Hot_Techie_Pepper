2011-04-08T20:48:00.000Z	Superstar		I've found*
2011-04-08T20:49:00.000Z	meganerd	Superstar	but you will be limited by the USB bus which is likely slower than the internal SATA interface of the slower drive
2011-04-08T20:52:00.000Z	Superstar	meganerd	yeh that's true, would you recommend off the internal drive?
2011-04-08T20:52:00.000Z	meganerd	Superstar	I boot off of a USB harad drive on my Windows 7 machine.  It works fine
2011-04-08T20:54:00.000Z	meganerd	Superstar	that particular computer has 8 GiB of RAM, so once I have loaded my apps it is fast.  Just reading and writing the USB drive is slower.  For most day to day tasks you should not notice the difference
2011-04-09T02:15:00.000Z	meganerd	Superstar	type "ip addr" without the quotes
2011-04-09T02:17:00.000Z	Superstar	meganerd	I get this > 2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UNKNOWN qlen 1000
2011-04-13T04:16:00.000Z	meganerd	Superstar	sleuthkit/autopsy can do some file recovery, there has been some work parsing the MFT recently by some security researchers.  Nothing really easy that I know of.
2011-04-13T04:17:00.000Z	meganerd	Superstar	fixntfs is like a lite version of chkdsk, but you usually want chkdsk
2011-04-13T04:17:00.000Z	Superstar	meganerd	no chkdsk won't recover mft or bootsector
2011-04-13T04:18:00.000Z	meganerd	Superstar	but windows install cd has fixboot and fixmbr
2011-04-13T04:19:00.000Z	meganerd	Superstar	either way this sounds OT to me
2011-04-13T04:19:00.000Z	Superstar	meganerd	I appreciate your help but those won't recover a deleted partition
2011-04-13T04:20:00.000Z	meganerd	Superstar	foremost can sometimes carve files out of a disk image (or raw disk device), autopsy and sleuthkit are probably your next best bets
2011-04-13T04:22:00.000Z	meganerd	Superstar	fixmbr might be what you want, best to ask about that in a Windows channel
2011-04-14T05:15:00.000Z	meganerd	Superstar	why are you running as root?
2011-04-14T05:15:00.000Z	Superstar	meganerd	I'm running under a VM environment
2011-04-14T05:16:00.000Z	meganerd	Superstar	if you have root, create a user.
2011-04-14T05:16:00.000Z	meganerd	Superstar	hardware or VM, it does not make a difference
2011-04-14T05:17:00.000Z	Superstar	meganerd	but I need it to run under root
2011-04-14T05:18:00.000Z	meganerd	Superstar	Why?  And what program is this?
