2006-10-09T13:09:00.000Z	anon32	bruenig	it's a huge logfile
2006-10-09T13:27:00.000Z	bruenig	anon32	I use utorrent, works perfect, I am running it right now, in fact it always runs on its own workspace

2006-10-19T06:43:00.000Z	anon32	bruenig	don't symbolic links have to be restored with each logon?
