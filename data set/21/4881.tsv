2008-01-23T04:50:00.000Z	neverblue	kylcrow_	I really doubt its 'made for just windows'
2008-01-23T04:50:00.000Z	kylcrow_	neverblue	i meant the laptop was sorry   its a  Broadcom Corporation BCM94311MCG wlan mini-PCI card
2008-01-23T04:51:00.000Z	neverblue	kylcrow_	I didnt ask you what type of card
2008-01-23T04:52:00.000Z	neverblue	kylcrow_	you just told me what card it was, now your saying you dont know what card it is, plus I asked you what router u were using, not what card
2008-01-23T04:53:00.000Z	kylcrow_	neverblue	It is a school router that I can not control
2008-01-23T04:53:00.000Z	neverblue	kylcrow_	then possibly others at the school are having the same issues
2008-01-23T04:54:00.000Z	kylcrow_	neverblue	 i have no trouble with the same laptop running windows
2008-01-23T04:56:00.000Z	kylcrow_	neverblue	i have no trouble with the same laptop running windows\
2008-01-23T04:56:00.000Z	neverblue	kylcrow_	so you dont think that right now the wireless network is the issue, its the Ubuntu or the card or driver ?
2008-01-23T04:56:00.000Z	neverblue	kylcrow_	repeating is not necessary
