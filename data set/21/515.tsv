2012-09-18T07:07:00.000Z	afflicto		I seem to have a apache permission problem. my php script tries to require_once some files and I get "Warning: Unknown: failed to open stream: Permission denied in Unknown on line 0 Fatal error: Unknown: Failed opening required". Thanks in advance
2012-09-18T07:08:00.000Z	ikonia	afflicto	why is that a permissions problem ?
2012-09-18T07:08:00.000Z	afflicto	ikonia	I don't know. I guess it is? :P
2012-09-18T07:09:00.000Z	ikonia	afflicto	I'd suggest debugging the script
2012-09-18T07:16:00.000Z	ikonia	afflicto	I'd suggest talking to the dreamcms people about how to set it up on ubuntu
2012-09-18T07:16:00.000Z	afflicto	ikonia	well then I have to talk to myself :P
2012-09-18T07:16:00.000Z	ikonia	afflicto	or reading the documentation on how to setup Dream CMS
2012-09-18T07:16:00.000Z	ikonia	afflicto	why ? is this your application ?
2012-09-18T07:17:00.000Z	afflicto	ikonia	yes :P http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zaSMB_LtyI
2012-09-18T07:17:00.000Z	ikonia	afflicto	so this is your application that you've written, but you have no idea how to install it or set it up ?
2012-09-18T07:18:00.000Z	ikonia	afflicto	it's not an apache problem
2012-09-18T07:18:00.000Z	ikonia	afflicto	you've not setup the enviornment
2012-09-18T07:18:00.000Z	ikonia	afflicto	I'm concerned you don't know how to setup your own application that you've written
2012-09-18T07:19:00.000Z	afflicto	ikonia	dreamCMS works fine. if I create a php file named cake.php and type require_once cake2.php I get errors. permission errors.
2012-09-18T07:19:00.000Z	ikonia	afflicto	if it works fine, why is it complaining it can't find sourced files
2012-09-18T07:19:00.000Z	ikonia	afflicto	and again - I'm concerned you don't know how to set your own application up
2012-09-18T07:20:00.000Z	afflicto	ikonia	i'm not setting up dreamcms. I'm setting up apache >.<
2012-09-18T07:20:00.000Z	ikonia	afflicto	apache is setup
2012-09-18T07:20:00.000Z	ikonia	afflicto	the files you are setting up are you own application files
2012-09-18T07:20:00.000Z	ikonia	afflicto	don't need to use the tool
2012-09-18T07:21:00.000Z	ikonia	afflicto	yes, because you are not creating the files correctly
