2007-02-07T10:49:00.000Z	hellmet		has anybody successfully used Beryl iwth AIGLX on Intel 915GAV??
2007-02-07T10:51:00.000Z	Jowi	hellmet	what is the video chipset?
2007-02-07T10:53:00.000Z	Jowi	hellmet	"glxinfo | grep direct" give you yes or no?
2007-02-07T10:53:00.000Z	Jowi	hellmet	are you using dapper or edgy?
2007-02-07T10:54:00.000Z	hellmet	Jowi	I actually was able to start Beryl. but what happened was that:: titlebars and borders vanished
2007-02-07T10:55:00.000Z	Jowi	hellmet	it should work just fine. all you need to do is to add the "composite" option to your xorg.conf and restart. after that login normally into gnome and type "beryl-manager"
2007-02-07T10:56:00.000Z	hellmet	Jowi	Where do I add 'composite' in xorg.conf
2007-02-07T10:57:00.000Z	Jowi	hellmet	at the end. have a look here and see the "Enable compositing in X" headline and only do what's written for "Intel" https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BerylOnEdgy
2007-02-07T10:58:00.000Z	hellmet	Jowi	I also get this when I typed ur command  :  libGL warning: 3D driver claims to not support visual 0x5b
2007-02-07T10:58:00.000Z	Jowi	hellmet	that is normal. you can ignore that message. 0x5b is not used
2007-02-07T10:59:00.000Z	hellmet	Jowi	OK.. will try and inform you in a moment :-)
2007-02-07T11:11:00.000Z	hellmet	Jowi	Cool.. thanks a TON for that link and your help..

2007-02-07T11:12:00.000Z	Jowi	hellmet	no idea about that. I don't use gnome.
2007-02-07T11:12:00.000Z	hellmet	Jowi	Ohh ok.. I'll look into it. then
2007-02-07T11:14:00.000Z	Jowi	hellmet	people in #ubuntu-xgl might have some ideas
