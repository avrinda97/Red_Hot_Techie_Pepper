2008-04-23T07:57:00.000Z	amenado		vhaarr-> paste your /etc/hostname and  /etc/resolv.conf
2008-04-23T07:58:00.000Z	amenado		vhaarr-> paste your /etc/hostname and  /etc/resolv.conf  once more..
2008-04-23T08:00:00.000Z	amenado		vhaarr-> at the time you can not sudo, are you able to resolve another host like www.yahoo.com?

2008-04-23T08:02:00.000Z	amenado		vhaarr-> i meant to ask what's the content of your /etc/hosts also
2008-04-23T08:04:00.000Z	amenado		vhaarr-> try to make that /etc/hosts entry look like  127.0.0.1 localhost.homedomain.com  localhost folk
