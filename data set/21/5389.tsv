2008-09-26T11:11:00.000Z	dystopia		hmm odd
2008-09-26T11:12:00.000Z	dystopia		ou need to disable hvm
2008-09-26T11:12:00.000Z	dystopia		you cannot use hvm during winxp install
2008-09-26T11:12:00.000Z	gluonman	dystopia	hvm?
2008-09-26T11:13:00.000Z	gluonman	dystopia	what's hvm?
2008-09-26T11:14:00.000Z	gluonman	dystopia	what's wrong with installing winxp with virtualbox? I've done it on two other computers (only because my CS class requires the use of Microsoft Visual Studio).
2008-09-26T11:15:00.000Z	dystopia	gluonman	nothing is wrong with it except you need to temp disable HVM
2008-09-26T11:15:00.000Z	gluonman	dystopia	how do I do that?
2008-09-26T11:16:00.000Z	gluonman	dystopia	I didn't worry about hvm the last time I did successful winxp installations.
2008-09-26T11:19:00.000Z	gluonman	dystopia	phantomcircuit, what I don't understand is that this same winxp live CD that worked perfectly in virtualbox on two of my Ubuntu 8.04 machines doesn't completely install on the one in question (also vbox on Ubuntu 8.04).
2008-09-26T11:20:00.000Z	gluonman	dystopia	phantomcircuit, the installation gets to a certain point (after setting the time zone, etc.) where it says I have 34 minutes left of installation, and virtualbox just resets it and starts again from a prior point.
2008-09-26T11:22:00.000Z	gluonman	dystopia	I don't think that website really pertains to my issues.
2008-09-26T11:22:00.000Z	gluonman	dystopia	I need virtualbox, not python.
2008-09-26T11:23:00.000Z	gluonman	dystopia	well, how would we apply that in terms of virtualbox?
2008-09-26T11:28:00.000Z	gluonman	dystopia	where do I find the hardware virtualization option that I can disable in the virtual machine settings?
2008-09-26T11:34:00.000Z	gluonman	dystopia	still there? I had a question for you.
2008-09-26T11:34:00.000Z	gluonman	dystopia	about disabling HMV. I don't know where to find it.
2008-09-26T11:35:00.000Z	gluonman	dystopia	I'll figure it out, then.
2008-09-26T11:35:00.000Z	dystopia	gluonman	lsmod | grep kvm
2008-09-26T11:36:00.000Z	gluonman	dystopia	let me try that.
2008-09-26T11:37:00.000Z	gluonman	dystopia	it didn't give me any output.
