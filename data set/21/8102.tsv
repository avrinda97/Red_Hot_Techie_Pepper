2007-04-15T10:09:00.000Z	dxdemetriou		is there an option to start any program full screen and on top?
2007-04-15T10:10:00.000Z	Pelo	dxdemetriou	 you can probably make a litle rule using  devilspie,  it's in synaptic
2007-04-15T10:12:00.000Z	dxdemetriou	Pelo	isn't there a command for gnome to give initially the values that you can do? thanks for help, I'll give a try
2007-04-15T10:13:00.000Z	Pelo	dxdemetriou	 I don't know of one but I am fairly noobish
2007-05-26T08:17:00.000Z	Pelo	dxdemetriou	 you can make rules to move them about
2007-05-26T08:18:00.000Z	Pelo	dxdemetriou	 based on  to: address or subject or whatever
2007-05-26T08:18:00.000Z	dxdemetriou	Pelo	I haven't found anything how can I do that
2007-05-26T08:18:00.000Z	Pelo	dxdemetriou	hold on
2007-05-26T08:19:00.000Z	Pelo	dxdemetriou	right click on inbox,  create new folder, make a new one give it the name of one of your accounts
2007-05-26T08:21:00.000Z	Pelo	dxdemetriou	still there ?
2007-05-26T08:21:00.000Z	dxdemetriou	Pelo	you mean to name the folder name@provider.com?
2007-05-26T08:22:00.000Z	Pelo	dxdemetriou	 just someting that wont, confuse you , so you know what that folder is about
2007-05-26T08:23:00.000Z	Pelo	dxdemetriou	 it shouldn,t be taking this long
2007-05-26T08:26:00.000Z	Pelo	dxdemetriou	are you still tring to make a folder ?  that's not the only step we ahve other things to do
2007-05-26T08:29:00.000Z	dxdemetriou	Pelo	I made a folder, but I didn't find a rule to point the inbox in specific folder. maybe I'll try something like fetchmail, like gotmail I use for hotmail
2007-05-26T08:30:00.000Z	Pelo	dxdemetriou	doesn'T work like that,  go in the inbox,  find a email for which the to : adress matches the one that you want transfered to that fodler
2007-05-26T08:31:00.000Z	Pelo	dxdemetriou	  right click on that email,  atthe bottom create a rule based on that ....,   select filter by receiver or what ever it is in english
2007-05-26T08:32:00.000Z	Pelo	dxdemetriou	 you'll get a dialog box pre filled out,   in the bottom portion just add an action to move to (folder),    apply   new emails matching will be move on reception
2007-05-26T09:21:00.000Z	dxdemetriou	Pelo	thanks for help, it worked. The only I missed now is the option to delete the mails from server after I empty the trash :)
2007-05-26T09:22:00.000Z	Pelo	dxdemetriou	I think that is something you need to set elsewhere,  and it's delete from server after download,  not when trash is emptied as I recall
2007-05-26T09:24:00.000Z	dxdemetriou	Pelo	yes, but to be safe to not lost anything I have check to leave a copy on server. anyway, I see that evolution keep track for anything, so maybe is ok
