2010-03-18T06:16:00.000Z	Stephie		Can someone please help me..
2010-03-18T06:18:00.000Z	Ten-Eight	Stephie	I wish I could, I don't use dial-up anymore.  Is the modem a hardware modem like an external USR?  Most of the hardware modems are supported.
2010-03-18T06:19:00.000Z	Ten-Eight	Stephie	a winmodem type?
2010-03-18T06:20:00.000Z	Stephie	Ten-Eight	I'm pretty sure I had built the drivers for it, and had it all set up (I think) and when I tried wvdial it sent my modem some initilization strings, but then it said modem isn't responding
2010-03-18T06:22:00.000Z	Ten-Eight	Stephie	I assume the modem is supported then if you have the correct drivers?
2010-03-18T06:23:00.000Z	Ten-Eight	Stephie	I assume the modem is supported then if you have the correct drivers?
2010-03-18T06:23:00.000Z	Ten-Eight	Stephie	I assume the modem is supported then if you have the correct drivers?
2010-03-18T06:28:00.000Z	Ten-Eight	Stephie	yes?
2010-03-18T06:29:00.000Z	Stephie	Ten-Eight	Do you think you could help me do this? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=460331
2010-03-18T06:30:00.000Z	Ten-Eight	Stephie	type "lspci" in a terminal window.  does the modem show up on the list?
2010-03-18T06:31:00.000Z	Ten-Eight	Stephie	aaahhh....okay then.
2010-03-18T06:31:00.000Z	Stephie	Ten-Eight	sorry not used to having to type out the name of who I'm talking to
2010-03-18T06:32:00.000Z	Ten-Eight	Stephie	tis okay. we need to get the "scanmodem.gz" file then.
2010-03-18T06:32:00.000Z	Ten-Eight	Stephie	okay...and it's on your Ubuntu machine already?
2010-03-18T06:34:00.000Z	Ten-Eight	Stephie	okay. you've already been through the tutorial then?
2010-03-18T06:35:00.000Z	Ten-Eight	Stephie	well...the page link you sent me has the steps you need to follow.
2010-03-18T06:35:00.000Z	Ten-Eight	Stephie	tutorial maybe not the right description.
2010-03-18T06:35:00.000Z	Stephie	Ten-Eight	Yeah but, I don't really understand what it's wanting me to do, I'm VERY new to linux and don't fully understand the terminal
2010-03-18T06:36:00.000Z	Ten-Eight	Stephie	basically, you're building the driver for the modem so it'll work.
2010-03-18T06:37:00.000Z	Stephie	Ten-Eight	Do you have msn? This is confusing with 1300 people
2010-03-18T06:37:00.000Z	Ten-Eight	Stephie	hang on a sec
