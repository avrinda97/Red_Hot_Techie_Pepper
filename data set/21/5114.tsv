2008-01-30T19:10:00.000Z	laughzilla	bazhang	- do you maybe have an idea as to why deleting the .mp3 files i put in my friend's ipod via rhythmbox has caused me to be unable to copy any more files to my ipod?  note: i even manually deleted the files after i noticed that rhythmbox had not actually removed the files from the ipod's file directories ... so i removed all those files and their empty directories, even rebooted this ubuntu box and again ran the commands from  htt
2008-01-30T19:10:00.000Z	bazhang	laughzilla	did you empty the trash?
2008-01-30T19:12:00.000Z	laughzilla	bazhang	- i emptied the trash on my desktop and rebooted since then ... or do  u mean did i empty the trach via the ipod itself? (i don't know how to do that)
2008-01-30T19:13:00.000Z	bazhang	laughzilla	you worked so hard to install those files then immediately deleted them?
2008-01-30T19:14:00.000Z	laughzilla	bazhang	- those were only the first files i had to copy there anyway
2008-01-30T19:15:00.000Z	bazhang	laughzilla	what about other mp3s? do they copy over correctly?
2008-01-30T19:16:00.000Z	laughzilla	bazhang	- nope, i tried that as well before asking in here :)
2008-01-30T19:17:00.000Z	bazhang	laughzilla	I know amarok; rhythmbox not so much
2008-01-30T19:18:00.000Z	laughzilla	bazhang	- ok thanks :)

2008-01-30T19:25:00.000Z	laughzilla	bazhang	- yeah thanks again, :)  good questions from you and others, plus logic and trial & error contributed to how it got figured out.  :)
2008-02-13T20:32:00.000Z	laughzilla	bazhang	- miro is an RSS video grabber ... will it also work on clips from the typical video sites, youtube, myspace, revver, etc ?
