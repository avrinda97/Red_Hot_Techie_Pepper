2008-10-11T20:00:00.000Z	ktne		hello
2008-10-11T20:00:00.000Z	ktne		i have installed ubuntu and nvidia drivers properly
2008-10-11T20:00:00.000Z	ktne		howhever the GUI is really slow and unresponsive
2008-10-11T20:00:00.000Z	ktne		what might be the cause? can i change the window manager to something else?
2008-10-11T20:00:00.000Z	lucax	ktne	sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx
2008-10-11T20:01:00.000Z	ktne	lucax	[mors] the nvidia drivers are running properly, nvidia settings panel and opengl works
2008-10-11T20:01:00.000Z	lucax	ktne	right click on desktop and enable desktop effects
2008-10-11T20:02:00.000Z	ktne	lucax	they are enabled, they work
2008-10-11T20:02:00.000Z	lucax	ktne	u see all slow?
2008-10-11T20:02:00.000Z	ktne	lucax	the GUI is slow to update
2008-10-11T20:02:00.000Z	ktne	lucax	all applications feel like firefox
2008-10-11T20:03:00.000Z	lucax	ktne	ammm, install bum and chek whats running from boot, sessions too
2008-10-11T20:04:00.000Z	lucax	ktne	u may have to disable some things u dont need and restart
2008-10-11T20:04:00.000Z	ktne	lucax	 htop reports no unusual stuff other than very high cpu usage by the X server (like 20% on a quad core cpu)
2008-10-11T20:05:00.000Z	lucax	ktne	thats why i think u have something running u shouldnt be running
2008-10-11T20:05:00.000Z	ktne	lucax	 but most other applications consume no cpu
2008-10-11T20:06:00.000Z	ktne	lucax	only /usr/bin/X11/X and compiz consume that much
2008-10-11T20:06:00.000Z	ktne	lucax	and sometime firefox but that's expected
2008-10-11T20:07:00.000Z	lucax	ktne	nope... im running ubuntu form a pendrive with an atom and i only get 9%
2008-10-11T20:08:00.000Z	ktne	lucax	 something is wrong then, any idea how to change the window manager?
2008-10-11T20:09:00.000Z	lucax	ktne	if ur running compiz install compiz manager and in window decorator u can type emerald --replace or metacity --replace
