2005-02-20T14:25:00.000Z	mpq		what do I use to view animated .gif files?
2005-02-20T14:26:00.000Z	mpq		I don't know what to use to view animated gifs
2005-02-20T14:27:00.000Z	jdub	mpq	your browser...
2005-02-20T14:28:00.000Z	jdub	mpq	i'm sure there are plenty of other things, but i'm suggesting the easiest
2005-02-21T17:24:00.000Z	jdub	mpq	see how it says "please install libpng and libpng-dev packages"? do that :)
2005-02-21T17:25:00.000Z	jdub	mpq	synaptic, aptitude, apt-get...
2005-02-21T17:28:00.000Z	jdub	mpq	the package manager gui; computer > system configuration > synaptic package manager (on warty)
2005-02-21T17:28:00.000Z	jdub	mpq	sudo apt-get install ...
2005-02-21T17:29:00.000Z	jdub	mpq	you should probably read about apt
2005-02-21T09:36:00.000Z	jdub	mpq	there's a few out there; google :-)
2005-02-21T14:20:00.000Z	jdub	mpq	sound juicer does,
2005-02-21T14:20:00.000Z	jdub	mpq	but sometimes the musicbrainz data is borked
2005-02-21T14:21:00.000Z	jdub	mpq	an online database of music metadata
2005-02-21T14:22:00.000Z	jdub	mpq	not always
2005-02-21T14:22:00.000Z	jdub	mpq	it totally depends, with both systems, on the particular album you've inserted
2005-02-21T14:22:00.000Z	jdub	mpq	the musicbrainz data is on the whole, better than freedb
2005-02-21T14:22:00.000Z	jdub	mpq	itunes is a different story altogether
2005-02-21T14:23:00.000Z	jdub	mpq	itunes is a well funded piece of software and infrastructure, it's hardly comparable
2005-02-21T14:25:00.000Z	jdub	mpq	i recommend sticking with sound-juicer for ripping; fixing up rare incorrect data isn't hard and doesn't take long
2005-02-22T07:40:00.000Z	jdub	mpq	install windows first, use only the amount of space you need
2005-02-22T07:40:00.000Z	jdub	mpq	then install ubuntu in the free space
