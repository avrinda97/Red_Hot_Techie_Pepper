2011-11-19T03:48:00.000Z	slucidi	hdon_	easy and cheap, you can pick up a Galaxy gt520 for about 50$
2011-11-19T03:48:00.000Z	hdon_	slucidi	crap i forgot one other caveat
2011-11-19T03:48:00.000Z	hdon_		and this fact... makes the $100 or less part easy
2011-11-19T03:48:00.000Z	hdon_		in fact unavoidable
2011-11-19T03:48:00.000Z	hdon_		it needs to be AGP
2011-11-19T03:48:00.000Z	slucidi		uhoh.

2011-11-19T03:49:00.000Z	hdon_		well i just replaced their hard drive and their optical drive and their power supply
2011-11-19T03:49:00.000Z	slucidi		let me see what I can dig up on the tubes.
2011-11-19T03:49:00.000Z	hdon_		maybe i should go the last mile and give them a new mobo
2011-11-19T03:50:00.000Z	slucidi	hdon_	you could grab a geforce 6200 from newegg for under $50 that would do the trick
2011-11-19T03:50:00.000Z	hdon_	slucidi	thanks! :)
2011-11-19T03:50:00.000Z	slucidi		no problem =]
2011-11-19T03:52:00.000Z	slucidi	hdon_	you've got a few options among specific manufacturers with little difference in price... try and get one with a little more ram.  you should be able to get 512 on one of those
