2010-06-27T12:10:00.000Z	mek8630		does anyone know an easy way to download and install a different version of the kernel?
2010-06-27T12:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mek8630	you'll need the debs for the kernel, the modules and the headers
2010-06-27T12:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mek8630	i'd say very caution. Some are very experimental
2010-06-27T12:13:00.000Z	mek8630	ActionParsnip	I am wanting to use an older version
2010-06-27T12:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mek8630	same applys, you may find some stuff in your release needs certain stuff in the kernel which may be lacking in older versions
2010-06-27T12:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mek8630	mint isn't supported here
2010-06-27T12:15:00.000Z	mek8630	ActionParsnip	I understand this is the Ubuntu chat, but I am asking about kernels
2010-06-27T12:15:00.000Z	mek8630	ActionParsnip	also Mint is based off of Ubuntu
2010-06-27T12:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mek8630	yes its based but its not supported here
2010-06-27T12:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mek8630	like I said, its NOT supported here
2010-06-27T12:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mek8630	if you expect support in the official ubuntu channel you must be using an official canonical release
2010-06-27T12:18:00.000Z	mek8630	ActionParsnip	I am using Xubuntu right now in this channel but really please don't talking to me, I don't really need your input
2010-06-27T12:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mek8630	just telling you mint isn't supported and for why
2010-07-05T00:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mek8630	this is ubuntu support only. Gos will be discussed in #ubuntu-offtopic
2010-07-05T00:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mek8630	if you have an ubuntu issue then you are in the right place, otherwise #ubuntu-offtopic is for you
2010-07-05T00:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mek8630	someone using gos is not an ubuntu related question
2010-07-05T00:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mek8630	no just keeping the channel rules
2010-07-05T00:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mek8630	some people just don't understand simple english
2010-07-05T00:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mek8630	once again. If you question is you having issues with firefox in lucid, or an app won't install in karmic we are here to help. Uestions regarding non canonical releases of ubuntu are offtopic here and that's why #ubuntu-offtopic exists
2010-07-05T00:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mek8630	its not a powertrip at all
2010-07-05T00:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mek8630	see what happens when you just ask the question ;)
