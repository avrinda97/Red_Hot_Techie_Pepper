2006-09-12T16:47:00.000Z	TylerDurdener		is there a linux alternative to Daemon Tools?
2006-09-12T16:47:00.000Z	Rico-	TylerDurdener	yes, mount
2006-09-12T16:48:00.000Z	TylerDurdener	Rico-	can mount mount image files?
2006-09-12T16:49:00.000Z	TylerDurdener	Rico-	do I have to put the iso in etc/fstab?
2006-09-12T16:49:00.000Z	Rico-	TylerDurdener	mount -o loop -t iso9660 image.iso /mnt/image
2006-09-12T16:52:00.000Z	TylerDurdener	Rico-	can I just use cd to the dir and do mount filename.iso?
2006-09-12T16:54:00.000Z	Rico-	TylerDurdener	fstab basically automatically mounts a bunch of things at start-up.
2006-09-12T16:55:00.000Z	Rico-	TylerDurdener	nothing, just run the command i gave you.
2006-09-12T16:56:00.000Z	Rico-	TylerDurdener	mkdir /mnt/image
2006-09-12T16:57:00.000Z	Rico-	TylerDurdener	plus keep in mind you'll need to change the iso filename
2006-09-12T16:58:00.000Z	Rico-	TylerDurdener	once mounted you can just umount /mnt/image
2006-09-12T16:58:00.000Z	Rico-	TylerDurdener	but as lupine_85 mentioned, you will have to specify the -o loop -t iso9600 stuff every time you mount the iso unless you add it to your fstab
2006-09-12T16:59:00.000Z	Rico-	TylerDurdener	if you're curious, the -o loop says 'mount a file, not a block device' (such as a harddrive), the -t specifies ISO format, and /mnt/image is where you want it mounted - you can change this
2006-09-12T05:01:00.000Z	TylerDurdener	Rico-	one more thing, unmount won't, it says it isn't a command
2006-09-12T05:24:00.000Z	Rico-	TylerDurdener	k3b will do it
2006-09-12T05:25:00.000Z	Rico-	TylerDurdener	install k3b, tools -> cd -> burn cd image
2006-09-12T05:26:00.000Z	Rico-	TylerDurdener	lord no! i couldn't live without amarok...
2006-09-12T05:41:00.000Z	TylerDurdener	Rico-	try Azureus, my favorite
2006-09-12T05:41:00.000Z	Rico-	TylerDurdener	how do you monitor it through ssh?
2006-09-12T05:42:00.000Z	Rico-	TylerDurdener	oh right  ssh allows you to connect to your computer from a remote computer, and open up a secure terminal.
2006-09-12T05:43:00.000Z	Rico-	TylerDurdener	nope, you just get a text server. I'd rather not set up vnc just to monitor torrents
