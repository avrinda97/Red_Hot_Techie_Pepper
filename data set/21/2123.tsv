2010-02-06T07:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	CAPcap	 thats just a usplash graphics i imagine.   its possible some usplash files dident get removed properly
2010-02-06T07:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	CAPcap	 synaptic has a feature to show installed packages
2010-02-06T07:20:00.000Z	CAPcap	Dr_Willis	what is it?
2010-02-06T07:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	CAPcap	 thers a button in synaptic to show installed packages.. explore the tool
2010-02-06T07:22:00.000Z	CAPcap	Dr_Willis	i dont see it. but thanks anyways
2010-06-04T19:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	CAPcap	 fire up the package manager , search for lxde and  select what you want.  but some apps may try to pull in others.
2010-06-04T19:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	CAPcap	 last i tried the lubuntu-desktop package pulled in a lot of extras i dident want. Not tried just 'lxde' lately
2010-06-04T19:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	CAPcap	 its openbox last i checked.
2010-06-04T20:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	CAPcap	 you proberly need to run network-manager or the nm-applet by hand
2010-06-04T20:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	CAPcap	 lubuntu likes to use wicd last i tried it.  you could try wicd also.
2010-06-04T20:52:00.000Z	CAPcap	Dr_Willis	is that a package I will need to install?
2010-06-04T20:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	CAPcap	 if you installed lxde on ubuntu, then the nm-applet  should be installed allready
2010-06-04T20:52:00.000Z	CAPcap	Dr_Willis	I've had lxde in the past but i installed lubuntu-desktop, i went without all that this time, so im having to fill in gaps
2010-06-04T20:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	CAPcap	 if you installed lubuntu-desktop package it may of removed network manager and installed wicd. You may want to ask in #lubuntu
2010-06-04T20:53:00.000Z	CAPcap	Dr_Willis	I didnt install that, i still have network manager. im in standard ubuntu right now
2010-06-04T20:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	CAPcap	 the have lubuntu launch the nm-applet perhaps.   I forget the name of the binary.
2010-06-04T20:58:00.000Z	CAPcap	Dr_Willis	I'm trying installing wicd
2010-06-04T20:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	CAPcap	 that might remove network manager
2010-07-16T19:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	CAPcap	 LBA i recall is needed for large sized hard drives.
2010-07-16T19:21:00.000Z	CAPcap	Dr_Willis	So since I'm doing a 3Gb partition on a 4Gb flash drive i can use the regular one?
