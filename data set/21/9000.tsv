2005-11-29T12:14:00.000Z	eatnumber1		and I used the installer
2005-11-29T12:14:00.000Z	eatnumber1		to check it
2005-11-29T12:14:00.000Z	gnomefreak	eatnumber1	 what speed did you burn it?
2005-11-29T12:06:00.000Z	eatnumber1	gnomefreak	x'pseverything is garbage
2005-11-29T12:12:00.000Z	gnomefreak	eatnumber1	 error that looks like us.archive.ubuntu.com?
2005-11-29T12:12:00.000Z	eatnumber1	gnomefreak	no, the error is like the installer crashes, and I see a grey screen with alot of texe
2005-11-29T12:13:00.000Z	gnomefreak	eatnumber1	 did you burn the cd after downloading it?
2005-11-29T12:13:00.000Z	eatnumber1	gnomefreak	yes... but im sure its a valid cd, i did a md5 check on the ISO and on the cd
2005-11-29T12:14:00.000Z	gnomefreak	eatnumber1	 reburn it at the lowest possible speed
2005-11-29T12:16:00.000Z	eatnumber1	gnomefreak	im booting ubuntu live so I can reburn it at 1x
2005-11-29T12:17:00.000Z	gnomefreak	eatnumber1	 i have burned tham as high as 8 but they say burn at slowest
2005-11-29T12:17:00.000Z	eatnumber1	gnomefreak	but still, since it said the media was valid, dosent that mean that there isent any problems with it?
2005-11-29T12:18:00.000Z	gnomefreak	eatnumber1	 there can be issues when burning too fast i dont make the rules i just know them :(
2005-11-29T12:21:00.000Z	gnomefreak	eatnumber1	 the iso might be good but if the burn got interuppted by something like your disk drive or left a file in download and never burned it it will cause that problem burning it at slower speed is how its fixed unless its a hardware issue
2005-11-29T12:23:00.000Z	eatnumber1	gnomefreak	k3b checked the md5hash of the actual CD after it burned it. Also, ubuntu's installer has a check cd function which said it was valid
2005-11-29T12:23:00.000Z	gnomefreak	eatnumber1	k3b checks the md5 before the copy not after it just verifies the copy was made
2005-11-29T12:24:00.000Z	gnomefreak	eatnumber1	 look man im not gonna argue with you if you dont want to reburn it dont ok but me and nalioth  have told you to see if it fixes it
2005-11-29T12:25:00.000Z	gnomefreak	eatnumber1	so do most other distros and not one have i found to be very accurate
