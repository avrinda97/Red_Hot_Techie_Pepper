2010-11-11T03:23:00.000Z	Chaos2358		yes it would
2010-11-11T03:24:00.000Z	Chaos2358		definatelly
2010-11-11T03:25:00.000Z	Chaos2358		it is a must for me because i have 20 hours of my 3 yr olds dvds ripped and i like to plug it in to his tv for him to watch but he has wandering fingers so i have to find a way to close my lid
2010-11-11T03:26:00.000Z	zaxonspox	Chaos2358	choose to "block your desktop" not to logout
2010-11-11T03:26:00.000Z	Chaos2358	zaxonspox	under what? dont have that option
2010-11-11T03:27:00.000Z	zaxonspox	Chaos2358	click on the icon you click when you want to logout, or turn off PC, and select "block" or what is written there The desktop
2010-11-11T03:29:00.000Z	zaxonspox	Chaos2358	and options like: "Guest Session", "Switch user", "Block desktop" ?
2010-11-11T03:30:00.000Z	Chaos2358	zaxonspox	 nope. single user with no guest optinons
2010-11-11T03:31:00.000Z	zaxonspox	Chaos2358	i am also only user, but i have those options
2010-11-11T03:32:00.000Z	Chaos2358	zaxonspox	not on mine i dont know why i had them on 10.04 but not after upgrade
2010-11-11T03:33:00.000Z	zaxonspox	Chaos2358	try pressing CTRL+ALT+L (by me is block/disable desktop)
2010-11-11T03:33:00.000Z	Chaos2358	zaxonspox	does nothing
2010-11-11T03:37:00.000Z	zaxonspox	Chaos2358	open from terminal gconf-editor and navigate to /apps/desktop/gnome/lockdown
2010-11-11T03:38:00.000Z	Chaos2358	zaxonspox	what is locking down going to do? i want the running applications to keep running
2010-11-11T03:39:00.000Z	zaxonspox	Chaos2358	and they will be running, but protected from "his figners" ("him to watch but he has wandering fingers")
2010-11-11T03:40:00.000Z	Chaos2358	zaxonspox	ok gotcha but those little fingers also like to stick pennyys in the keyboard so i need to be able to close it
2010-11-11T03:42:00.000Z	zaxonspox	Chaos2358	do you have a mini button that "catches" the closing lid, or magnes inside of your lid?
2010-11-11T03:42:00.000Z	Chaos2358	zaxonspox	i have the internal mags.
2010-11-11T03:43:00.000Z	zaxonspox	Chaos2358	you can plug it out :P i did so once, but, one more thing to do
2010-11-11T03:44:00.000Z	Chaos2358	zaxonspox	plug it out? meaning permanantly disable? not an option i need it to suspend when I AM using it but do nothing when he is using it
2010-11-11T03:44:00.000Z	zaxonspox	Chaos2358	in gconf-editor, navigate to /apps/gnome-power-manager there is a key "buttons" which contains "lid_sc" and "lid_battery"
