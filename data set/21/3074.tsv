2009-09-23T13:31:00.000Z	gp5st		 i have a macbook pro, i installed ubuntu on it, and used ntfstools and gparted to make a 3rd partiion on the same drive ntfs, but the mac os won't recognize that it's formated
2009-09-23T13:32:00.000Z	wzssyqa	gp5st	fomate it under windows
2009-09-23T13:32:00.000Z	gp5st	wzssyqa	that's not an option, i don't have an install
2009-09-23T13:33:00.000Z	wzssyqa	gp5st	get a winPE?
2009-09-23T13:33:00.000Z	gp5st		jordan: there have been rumors that it can be coxed to write:-p  but still I could just use ntfs-3g, but it's not playing nice with my machine
2009-09-23T13:33:00.000Z	gp5st		winpe?
2009-09-23T13:34:00.000Z	wzssyqa	gp5st	a windows livecd
2009-09-23T13:34:00.000Z	gp5st		interesting, but still, why would that solve the problem? what is gparted/ntfsprogs doing wrong
2009-09-23T13:34:00.000Z	gp5st		yeah, i'm reading up on it; i didn't know they existed
2009-09-23T13:42:00.000Z	gp5st		is there anyway to read an hfs+ drive with journaling on?
2009-09-23T13:43:00.000Z	gp5st		jordan: err, i emant read/write
2009-09-23T13:43:00.000Z	wzssyqa		挂牌
2009-09-23T13:43:00.000Z	gp5st		and isn't it bad to have journaling off
2009-09-23T13:43:00.000Z	gp5st		or am i just being a sissy
2009-09-23T13:43:00.000Z	wzssyqa	gp5st	haw many you fs?
2009-09-23T13:45:00.000Z	gp5st	wzssyqa	haw many you fs?
2009-09-23T13:46:00.000Z	wzssyqa	gp5st	how many kind of filesystem dou you use?
2009-09-23T13:46:00.000Z	gp5st		jordan: if there is a patch that does clean journaling, then why isn't it in the kernel?
2009-09-23T13:47:00.000Z	gp5st	wzssyqa	osx has hfs+, i did linux as xfs, and i planed on having a shared part. be ntfs, as i wanted to keep vm images there
2009-09-23T13:47:00.000Z	gp5st		if i could write to anything from both safely i would gladly use it:-\
2009-09-23T13:48:00.000Z	wzssyqa	gp5st	you are crazy
