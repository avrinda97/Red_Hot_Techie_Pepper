2006-07-25T07:04:00.000Z	iiiears		shrike - running sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg should fix it.
2006-07-25T07:05:00.000Z	shrike_00	iiiears	what would i look for  I ran dpkg-reconfigure on xserver-xorg and it still does same thing  should the line drivers in xorg.conf that lists "kbd and "mouse" list somethign else
2006-07-25T07:06:00.000Z	iiiears	cge	- what command can i use to see more about my pcmcia wifi card? lspci tells me it is Texas Instruments. - need the chip name/type
2006-07-25T07:07:00.000Z	iiiears		shrike - your mouse and keyboard settings are there. - other types of input devices also
2006-07-25T07:07:00.000Z	iiiears	cge	- erm - (weak grin) no... (begins to type furiously at the CLI
2006-07-25T07:08:00.000Z	shrike_00	iiiears	is it possible to jump back to breezy?  I can figure this out another day but i need the gui for the next week or so
2006-07-25T07:09:00.000Z	iiiears		shrike - not really enough info so i'lll have to guess.. no i don't think you can
2006-07-25T07:10:00.000Z	shrike_00	iiiears	ugh oh well i guess its google time then
2006-07-25T07:10:00.000Z	iiiears		shrike - lets see if we can't get your machine working with dapper. - are you willing?
2006-07-25T07:10:00.000Z	shrike_00	iiiears	sure
2006-07-25T07:10:00.000Z	iiiears		shrike - what happens when you run sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg?
2006-07-25T07:11:00.000Z	shrike_00	iiiears	it runs like it normally does on isntall.  Even autodetects every thing.  No errors
2006-07-25T07:11:00.000Z	iiiears		shrike - do you get a dwsktop interface or the boring CLI?
2006-07-25T07:12:00.000Z	shrike_00	iiiears	basically when the machine starts it acts like it is going to load but sits at blank screen then screen flashes like its retrying and does that 3 times adn then kicks me to cli
2006-07-25T07:12:00.000Z	iiiears		shrike - the error you described is almost certainly caused by the xorg.conf not listing a mouse and keyboard.
2006-07-25T07:13:00.000Z	iiiears		shrike - run "sudo lspci" compare what you see there with what is in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-07-25T07:14:00.000Z	shrike_00	iiiears	one sec
2006-07-25T07:15:00.000Z	iiiears		shrike - I need to apologize to you. - not able to help for a few mins. - my wife just put dinner on the table. - i am sorry, be back in 30 minutes. - sigh.
2006-07-25T07:18:00.000Z	shrike_00	iiiears	hmm dont see anything about a keyboard listed
