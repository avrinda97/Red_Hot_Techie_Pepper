2011-08-05T14:47:00.000Z	spexi		How can I list all network computers in command line? I have one Ubuntu machine but it's not shown on the network window, there's only Windows network. I can still connect to that computer with IP address.
2011-08-05T14:47:00.000Z	yagoo	spexi	smbclient -L <ip>/host
2011-08-05T14:47:00.000Z	spexi		It would be nice just connect to that computer by name
2011-08-05T14:47:00.000Z	spexi		ok thanks
2011-08-05T14:48:00.000Z	yagoo	spexi	apt-cache search samba (there's smbtree and smbclient)
2011-08-05T14:48:00.000Z	yagoo	spexi	there's even gui ones ..
2011-08-05T14:49:00.000Z	spexi		Ok
2011-08-05T14:49:00.000Z	yagoo	spexi	what do u mean your ubuntu machine not being shown on the network window? (trying to use nmbd ?)
2011-08-05T14:50:00.000Z	spexi	yagoo	When navigating to Places-Network
2011-08-05T14:50:00.000Z	spexi		that computer is not listed there
2011-08-05T14:51:00.000Z	spexi		That computer has this irssi which I'm using right now, so I can connect to that computer with IP, no probs
2011-08-05T14:51:00.000Z	yagoo	spexi	u can use the nmbd daemon (this is part of the samba package)
2011-08-05T14:51:00.000Z	spexi		just wondering that should it be listed there
2011-08-05T14:51:00.000Z	yagoo	spexi	use swat.. it's easier to set things up.. (apt-get install swat)
2011-08-05T14:51:00.000Z	spexi		Okay
2011-08-05T14:52:00.000Z	spexi		yeah
2011-08-05T14:52:00.000Z	yagoo	spexi	then url:localhost:601 if i'm correct or its another port (u use firefox)
2011-08-05T14:52:00.000Z	spexi		have to try those things
2011-08-05T14:52:00.000Z	yagoo	spexi	it's port 901..
2011-08-05T14:53:00.000Z	spexi	yagoo	ok thanks
2011-08-05T14:53:00.000Z	yagoo	spexi	so once swat is started.. u can do http://localhost:901 .. it not then http://127.0.0.1:901
