2007-11-17T05:29:00.000Z	alphin	nickrud	 and mosibfu thanks
2007-11-17T05:29:00.000Z	nickrud	alphin	read back, there was an explanation posted to yoi
2007-11-17T07:17:00.000Z	nickrud	alphin	yes, it'll have support for nearly a year yet
2007-11-17T07:19:00.000Z	nickrud	alphin	no, the gutsy debs are for use with gutsy only
2007-11-17T07:19:00.000Z	nickrud	alphin	yes, but the software on those cd's are packaged as debs.
2007-11-17T07:20:00.000Z	nickrud	alphin	ah, different :) stick in the cd with mp3's on it, drag & drop them where you want
2007-11-17T07:21:00.000Z	nickrud	alphin	I think we're talking at cross purposes, exactly where are these files
2007-11-17T07:21:00.000Z	alphin	nickrud	in my gutsy gibbon's share folder downloaded via it's torrent downloader
2007-11-17T07:22:00.000Z	nickrud	alphin	ok, and where's your feisty?
2007-11-17T07:22:00.000Z	nickrud	alphin	ah. ok
2007-11-17T07:23:00.000Z	nickrud	alphin	there's a technique; you wound create a directory called for example /music on the gutsy
2007-11-17T07:24:00.000Z	alphin	nickrud	I have long road out of eden on here (20 songs) and eric claptons newest (36 of his hits) seriously? i'd be burning for hours...
2007-11-17T07:24:00.000Z	nickrud	alphin	then, move your music there.
2007-11-17T07:24:00.000Z	nickrud	alphin	next, you would boot a live cd, and delete everything on the gutsy partition, except for /music
2007-11-17T07:25:00.000Z	nickrud	alphin	when you install feisty, you would tell it to not format the partition, and it will install around the music directory
2007-11-17T07:25:00.000Z	nickrud	alphin	that make sense to you?
2007-11-17T07:27:00.000Z	nickrud	alphin	no, I don't have an instant messenger
2007-11-17T07:28:00.000Z	alphin	nickrud	does this chat support pm?
2007-11-17T07:28:00.000Z	nickrud	alphin	3 steps: 1. move music to /music . 2. boot live cd, delete everything except /music . 3. install, but tell the installer not to format the disk
2007-11-17T07:28:00.000Z	nickrud	alphin	yup
