2010-02-15T20:57:00.000Z	neezer		192.168.1.105
2010-02-15T20:57:00.000Z	neezer		it is the internal one... I also know the one external one.
2010-02-15T20:58:00.000Z	MK13	neezer	will you pm me what you are trying to do, so i can get caught up?
2010-02-15T20:59:00.000Z	MK13	neezer	so you are trying to access it over the internet, which you know your external ip and the router forwards the 22 port to the server box?
2010-02-15T21:00:00.000Z	neezer	MK13	it forwards port 2222, but yes.
2010-02-15T21:01:00.000Z	MK13	neezer	but it forwards the 2222 external port to 22 internal.... or did you change the ssh on the server?
2010-02-15T21:01:00.000Z	neezer	MK13	I changed it on the server and router. it is set up to recieve an ssh connection on port 2222. it works perfectly.
2010-02-15T21:02:00.000Z	MK13	neezer	ok then what are you having problems with?
2010-02-15T21:04:00.000Z	neezer	MK13	furythor, Trek: when I go to Places -> Connect to server and try to put things in there I get stuck. I'd like to be able to browse the folders with a GUI and drag and drop onto the server rather than have to scp all the time. I had it set up 3 weeks ago running perfectly. It would connect via an ssh tunnel. I moved. I couldn't find a way to just change the IP address on the saved connection so I deleted them. Now I can't get new
2010-02-15T21:05:00.000Z	MK13	neezer	kk i under stand now
