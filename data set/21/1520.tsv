2010-11-03T11:07:00.000Z	bindi		mv <path_where_you_saved_it>patch-hidd-3.19-pabr3 .
2010-11-03T11:07:00.000Z	bindi		just as the guide says
2010-11-03T11:07:00.000Z	Sonic132	bindi	I didn't choose where to save it. Ubuntu saved it wherever it wanted to.
2010-11-03T11:08:00.000Z	Sonic132	bindi	I installed it from package manager since it wasn't working in terminal.
2010-11-03T11:09:00.000Z	Sonic132	bindi	I saved patch-hidd-3.19-pabr3 to /tmp
2010-11-03T11:10:00.000Z	Sonic132	bindi	Ok
2010-11-03T11:10:00.000Z	Sonic132	bindi	Well I would have but the command it said to use didn't work.
2010-11-03T11:11:00.000Z	Sonic132	bindi	It said it couldn't find a bluez-utils.
2010-11-03T11:11:00.000Z	Sonic132	bindi	But I found it just fine in package manager.
2010-11-03T11:12:00.000Z	Sonic132	bindi	So basicly I need to know where to put the patch file that it mentions in the guide so that bluez-utils will work with my controller and pair up.
2010-11-03T11:13:00.000Z	bindi	Sonic132	mv /tmp/patch-hidd-3.19-pabr3 .
2010-11-03T11:14:00.000Z	Sonic132	bindi	Where am I moving the file to? I don't know where bluez-utils is!
2010-11-03T11:14:00.000Z	bindi	Sonic132	to .
2010-11-03T11:15:00.000Z	Sonic132	bindi	Ok moved now what?
2010-11-03T11:15:00.000Z	bindi	Sonic132	follow the guide
2010-11-03T11:15:00.000Z	Sonic132	bindi	Where did we leave off with now?
2010-11-03T11:16:00.000Z	bindi	Sonic132	didnt "apt-get source bluez-utils" work?
2010-11-03T11:17:00.000Z	Sonic132	bindi	No it says 'E: Unable to find a source package for bluez'
2010-11-03T11:18:00.000Z	bindi	Sonic132	it works fine for me....
