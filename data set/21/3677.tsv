2008-10-29T01:04:00.000Z	Elswyyr		I've got some partition problems, could anyone please help me?
2008-10-29T01:04:00.000Z	Elswyyr		No matter what i do, i can't partition my hd. I've tried everything, and no matter what program i use, it won't let me.
2008-10-29T01:05:00.000Z	negge	Elswyyr	have you used the gparted live CD?
2008-10-29T01:06:00.000Z	Elswyyr	negge	i've used the cd, it said that the max size and the min size of the parttion was the same as my current size, so i can't do anything
2008-10-29T01:07:00.000Z	negge	Elswyyr	like [admin] said, run sudo fdisk -l and post a link to the pastebin
2008-10-29T01:08:00.000Z	Elswyyr	negge	I'm not very good at this stuff, so i don't know what that means. Could you please explain?
2008-10-29T01:09:00.000Z	negge	Elswyyr	go to Applications --> Accessories --> Terminal, write "sudo fdisk -l" (without the quotations), copy and paste the output to pastebin.ubuntu.com and post the link you get here
2008-10-29T01:11:00.000Z	negge	Elswyyr	I see. Then right-click My Computer, click Manage, go to Disk management, make a screenshot and paste it somewhere so we can see how your drives are partitioned
2008-10-29T01:11:00.000Z	negge	Elswyyr	the picture?
2008-10-29T01:11:00.000Z	negge	Elswyyr	anywhere.
2008-10-29T01:13:00.000Z	negge	Elswyyr	I'm Swedish so I think I'll manage
2008-10-29T01:19:00.000Z	negge	Elswyyr	you know there are thousands of sites where you can upload pictures, try http://imageshack.us/ for example.
2008-10-29T01:20:00.000Z	negge	Elswyyr	what happens if you right-click the C: partition and choose "Shrink partition" (or whatever it says in Danish)?
2008-10-29T01:23:00.000Z	negge	Elswyyr	that's probably because it's the system partition. Have you tried the Gparted live CD?
2008-10-29T01:24:00.000Z	Elswyyr	negge	yes, it says i can shrink it 0mb, and so does all the other tools i've tried, including the console
2008-10-29T01:25:00.000Z	negge	Elswyyr	you sure? I don't understand why Gparted wouldn't let you shrink your partition
2008-10-29T01:26:00.000Z	negge	Elswyyr	that's really weird
2008-10-29T01:26:00.000Z	Elswyyr	negge	i know, everyone i've asked has been stumped
2008-10-29T01:27:00.000Z	negge	Elswyyr	and you're absolutely sure you've been trying to resize the actual C: partition and not the first 700 MB rescue partition you have?
2008-10-29T01:28:00.000Z	Elswyyr	negge	yes, i'm completely sure, i can send you a screenshot of my trying to resize
2008-10-29T01:28:00.000Z	negge	Elswyyr	no need, I believe you
