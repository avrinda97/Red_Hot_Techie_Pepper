2010-10-28T07:42:00.000Z	furi		can someone please help me with this problem?
2010-10-28T07:42:00.000Z	garyholt	furi	what problem?
2010-10-28T07:42:00.000Z	furi	garyholt	i've been talking about it all day long
2010-10-28T07:42:00.000Z	garyholt	furi	I just came in
2010-10-28T07:42:00.000Z	furi	garyholt	oh
2010-10-28T07:43:00.000Z	furi	garyholt	well, nevertheless, i'd like to know if i can bring the logitech G510 to its fullest use; on windows, you can put applets on the screen, and the bindable keys on it are bindable, and you can use the mode keys. on linux, the screen just always says G510, and the function keys are F1 - F12 and the last 6 are 1 - 6 on the numberline, and the mode keys are unusable.
2010-10-28T07:44:00.000Z	garyholt	furi	ok ..hold on a sec
2010-10-28T07:47:00.000Z	garyholt	furi	it seems that it has pretty bad support for ubuntu :S
2010-10-28T07:47:00.000Z	garyholt	furi	is ubuntu your main OS?
2010-10-28T07:47:00.000Z	furi	garyholt	yes
2010-10-28T07:48:00.000Z	furi	garyholt	in fact, i have no other partitions
2010-10-28T07:48:00.000Z	furi	garyholt	tested it on my mom's vista computer
2010-10-28T07:48:00.000Z	furi	garyholt	and the stuff it could do was AWESOME
2010-10-28T07:49:00.000Z	garyholt	furi	did it contain any drivers for linux?
2010-10-28T07:49:00.000Z	garyholt	furi	if not ... have you tried to run the software via wine?
2010-10-28T07:49:00.000Z	furi	garyholt	no, only windows and linux, just like the N52te, which i traded in for this for that EXACT reason
2010-10-28T07:50:00.000Z	furi	garyholt	yes, i tried wine, even on N52, it doesn't change anything
2010-10-28T07:50:00.000Z	garyholt	furi	did you change wine settings from xp to windows 7 ?
2010-10-28T07:51:00.000Z	furi	garyholt	actually, no... not until after i did it; before i switched to 7 i think i had it on vista
2010-10-28T07:51:00.000Z	furi	garyholt	should i have it on xp?
2010-10-28T07:51:00.000Z	garyholt	furi	well originally it's xp but u can trie to change it to windows 7
