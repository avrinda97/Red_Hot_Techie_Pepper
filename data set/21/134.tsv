2012-08-12T05:19:00.000Z	Draugauth	Bethy	 Are you losing power or getting disconnected?
2012-08-12T05:21:00.000Z	Draugauth	Bethy	 Do you have an android phone?  if so download wifi analyzer and watch the signal strength on the router.  It might be crapping out on you.  Can also use that app to find less clogged channels.
2012-08-12T05:22:00.000Z	Draugauth	Bethy	 try seeing if you can find an app that will pick up Wireless APs and show their signal strength.
2012-08-12T05:31:00.000Z	Bethy	Draugauth	there doesnt seem to be any problems with the router.
2012-08-12T05:31:00.000Z	Draugauth	Bethy	 So the signal strength is staying steady right?
2012-08-12T05:39:00.000Z	Bethy	Draugauth	the signal strength is nice and steady
2012-08-12T05:40:00.000Z	Draugauth	Bethy	 Hrmm  have you tried loading a different driver for the wireless?   It shouldn't be dropping the connection if the signal strength is steady.  Let me look something up
2012-08-12T05:41:00.000Z	Bethy	Draugauth	 awww thankyou, im new to Ubuntu, i really appreciate this ^__^
2012-08-12T05:42:00.000Z	Draugauth	Bethy	 Disable IPV6 on it and see if that helps.
2012-08-12T05:43:00.000Z	Bethy	Draugauth	how do i do that?
2012-08-12T05:43:00.000Z	Draugauth	Bethy	 Click on the network icon and click configure network
2012-08-12T05:43:00.000Z	Draugauth	Bethy	 Then go to wireless if memory serves
2012-08-12T05:48:00.000Z	Bethy	Draugauth	 done it, deleted them, and re connected to the network, just waiting to see if it stops, thankyou for helping
2012-08-12T05:48:00.000Z	Draugauth	Bethy	 No problem.  If it doesn't we'll try checking the drivers and see if we can find you updated ones or not.
2012-08-12T05:50:00.000Z	Bethy	Draugauth	ahh, no luck, it done it again lol
2012-08-12T05:51:00.000Z	Draugauth	Bethy	 dang ok click the Unity icon in the top right and search for "additional drivers"
2012-08-12T05:52:00.000Z	Bethy	Draugauth	 i tried that and there was no additional drivers available. (a friend helpd with that lol)
2012-08-12T05:53:00.000Z	Draugauth	Bethy	 not sure what else then.   Someone asked if you had a broadcom.   Is the laptop setup for dual boot so you still have windows?
2012-08-12T05:54:00.000Z	Bethy	Draugauth	 no, just Ubuntu.
