2008-05-05T21:38:00.000Z	Dianabol		cshadowrun: is this already in main repo? and its terminal based correct?
2008-05-05T21:39:00.000Z	Dianabol		cshadowrun: its cool, thanks for the help though
2008-05-05T21:39:00.000Z	Dianabol		ecclesiastes: do you know what command i would use to do that?
2008-05-05T21:40:00.000Z	Dianabol		ecclesiastes: connect through the local network to another machine
2008-05-05T21:41:00.000Z	Dianabol		ecclesiastes: which program would u recommend for that?
2008-05-05T21:42:00.000Z	Dianabol		ecclesiastes: and how do i get local machine IPs?
2008-05-05T21:42:00.000Z	Dianabol		ecclesiastes: im just curious, and want to do it in terminal
2008-05-05T21:42:00.000Z	ejer	Dianabol	use smbtree to list available shares
2008-05-05T21:49:00.000Z	ejer	Dianabol	you use ssh IP
2008-05-05T21:53:00.000Z	ejer	Dianabol	to find IPs on network you can do 'nmap 192.168.1.0/24 -sP' (assuming you are using IPs in range 192.168.1.x)
2008-05-05T21:54:00.000Z	ejer	Dianabol	or just ifconfig on target machine
2008-05-05T21:59:00.000Z	ejer	Dianabol	ssh is a linux program, it is possible to install on windows, but not the same at all,,, you probably want rdesktop to control a windows desktop
2008-05-05T22:02:00.000Z	Dianabol	ejer	why use rdesktop? cause its more suitable for windows environment?
2008-05-05T22:02:00.000Z	ejer	Dianabol	because ssh is not in windows
2008-05-05T22:03:00.000Z	Dianabol	ejer	oh rdesktop = remote desktop ... LOL im slow atm running on very little sleep :S... but remote desktop has to be enabled on the other machine correct?
2008-05-05T22:17:00.000Z	ejer	Dianabol	Ecclesiastes the answer is easy, in windows, go to control panel>system>remote and enable remote desktop, then in linux, connect to that IP using rdesktop, done
2008-05-05T22:18:00.000Z	Dianabol	ejer	im doing this just for fun, so ill prolly do both (or atleast try to use both ways)
2008-05-05T22:19:00.000Z	ejer	Dianabol	there is no other way, telnet is not the way to go
2008-05-05T22:34:00.000Z	ejer	Dianabol	Ecclesiastes look at http://linux.die.net/man/1/rdesktop
