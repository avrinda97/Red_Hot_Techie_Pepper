2008-02-11T03:39:00.000Z	ikonia	yoluca	what card do you have
2008-02-11T03:40:00.000Z	yoluca	ikonia	nvidia 7900
2008-02-11T03:40:00.000Z	ikonia	yoluca	isn't that covered by the nvidia-glx-new package
2008-02-11T03:40:00.000Z	yoluca	ikonia	i need to reconfigure x...something like dpkg nvidia-reconfig
2008-02-11T03:40:00.000Z	ikonia	yoluca	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2008-02-11T03:41:00.000Z	yoluca	ikonia	it is ... i have that installed already ... i need to REconfigure it
2008-02-11T03:41:00.000Z	ikonia	yoluca	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2008-02-11T03:41:00.000Z	yoluca	ikonia	inst there a command for nvidia-glx ?
2008-02-11T03:42:00.000Z	ikonia	yoluca	I've just told you 2 times
2008-02-11T03:42:00.000Z	yoluca	ikonia	ok
2008-02-11T03:42:00.000Z	yoluca	ikonia	there is one in debian ...thats why i asked for it
2008-02-11T03:42:00.000Z	ikonia	yoluca	installthe nvidia-glx-new package and then "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" selecting the nvidia driver
2008-02-11T03:44:00.000Z	yoluca	ikonia	yeah got it .... in debian there was no need to run dpkg and select the nvidia driver ... there was a nvidia command which did everything for you ... thanks
2008-02-11T03:45:00.000Z	yoluca	ikonia	right .. there is something wrong ... soon the coonfig of xserver-xorg starts the system freeze ... i restarted and now same again ... any idea what can it be ?
2008-02-11T03:46:00.000Z	ikonia	yoluca	no idea, things freezing is most commonly bad ram. you may want to reboot to make sure the nvidia module is loaded
2008-02-11T03:46:00.000Z	yoluca	ikonia	yeah ok i see what i can do , thanks
2008-02-16T00:45:00.000Z	ikonia	yoluca	ln -s
