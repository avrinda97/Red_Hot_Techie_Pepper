2006-11-26T17:12:00.000Z	steve		hi
2006-11-26T17:12:00.000Z	steve		sorry to annoy you guys
2006-11-26T17:12:00.000Z	steve		but i got a little question
2006-11-26T17:13:00.000Z	steve		i just installed ubuntu 6.10 everything seems fine i got a new system with sata drives so i installed it to my sata disk
2006-11-26T17:13:00.000Z	steve		i said in the setup grub should be installed to hd0
2006-11-26T17:13:00.000Z	steve		but when i reboot grub doesn't show up what could be the problem?
2006-11-26T17:13:00.000Z	steve		anyone has a idea?
2006-11-26T17:14:00.000Z	enyc	steve	notice now the fstab and grub.conf use UUID nuwbers so you should be able to connect the hard disk differently... solong as the bios will present the disk as drive 0x80 it can be booted in short
2006-11-26T17:14:00.000Z	enyc	steve	you could connect via a pata-aadatper or external caddy, depending on the lreevant bios support
2006-11-26T17:16:00.000Z	enyc	steve	ddid that install ever boot on this system... stopped working at some point? etc.
2006-11-26T17:17:00.000Z	enyc	steve	thrrm grub not installed on MBR of the booting hard disk then?
2006-11-26T17:19:00.000Z	enyc	steve	hrrm  raid
2006-11-26T17:19:00.000Z	enyc	steve	fiiddly.. is the raid something that linux supprorts ?
2006-11-26T17:20:00.000Z	steve	enyc	atm ubuntu/linux shall not care about the controller card or the raid it shall install to the sata disk which it does fine and put grub on it :=
2006-11-26T17:20:00.000Z	enyc	steve	or is this one of those 'fakeraid' things where the bios software and windows-driver is the only tools that actually can read theaid without special setup of 'fakeraid' tolol?
2006-11-26T17:21:00.000Z	enyc	steve	fine, but you need to get BIOS at boot time to represent that sata disk at 0x80 in the INT 13 function calls and run that bootsector... and this deens to be the case when grub was installed in order for it to have setup in the right place ;-)
2006-11-26T17:21:00.000Z	enyc	steve	the raid card may take over INT 13 in its BIOS and make ithe raid 0x80 etc. and you may not boot from the sata drive therfore?
2006-11-26T17:22:00.000Z	enyc	steve	well if grub does not appear at all then it is not installed on the MBR of that drive ;-)
2006-11-26T17:23:00.000Z	enyc	steve	good question... i thnk you can boot from edgy live cd
2006-11-26T17:24:00.000Z	enyc	steve	then "grub" "root (hd0,?)" "setup (hd0)" where ? depends on the partition the  /boot/grub.menu.list  resides-in
2006-11-26T17:24:00.000Z	enyc	steve	from a root-probmpt (or "sudo grub"
