2011-11-02T14:12:00.000Z	soreau	sarthor	Well broadcom doesn't support linux open drivers so you just have to try different drivers
2011-11-02T14:13:00.000Z	sarthor	soreau	I was using this wireless lan card since 4 months, but yesterday i  created ADSL connection with pppoeconf command, after that i am not able to use my wireless lan card.

2011-11-02T14:38:00.000Z	soreau	sarthor	Is it an HP laptop with a switch by chance?
2011-11-02T14:48:00.000Z	soreau	sarthor	Does 'sudo iwlist eth1 scan|grep -i ssid' show AP's?
2011-11-02T14:50:00.000Z	soreau	sarthor	What does 'service network-manager status' show?
2011-11-02T14:51:00.000Z	soreau	sarthor	What's telling you 'network Dislabled.'?
2011-11-02T14:51:00.000Z	sarthor	soreau	lshw -c network says that
2011-11-02T14:51:00.000Z	soreau	sarthor	Does it work if you click on the network icon?
2011-11-02T14:52:00.000Z	sarthor	soreau	there, Wirless networks. .. and under that, "Device is not managed"
2011-11-02T14:52:00.000Z	soreau	sarthor	Can you pastebin your /etc/network/interfaces file to pastebin.com?
2011-11-02T14:54:00.000Z	sarthor	soreau	http://paste.ubuntu.com/726191/
2011-11-02T14:55:00.000Z	soreau	sarthor	Comment out the last two lines in that file, save it then restart network-manager with 'sudo service network-manager restart'
2011-11-02T14:55:00.000Z	sarthor	soreau	I did that already. And i can see networks now.
2011-11-02T14:56:00.000Z	soreau	sarthor	cool.. so does it work now?
2011-11-02T14:56:00.000Z	sarthor	soreau	Yea. fine.
2011-11-02T14:56:00.000Z	soreau	sarthor	awesome :-)
