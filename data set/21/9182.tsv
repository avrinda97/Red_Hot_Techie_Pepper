2005-10-28T14:15:00.000Z	the_daemon	NiGhTHiNG	are you OP here?
2005-10-28T14:16:00.000Z	NiGhTHiNG	the_daemon	No
2005-10-28T14:19:00.000Z	NiGhTHiNG	the_daemon	You need to change your httpd.conf or apache.conf or whatever conf file comes with your Apache installation (depends on version and distro)
2005-10-28T14:20:00.000Z	NiGhTHiNG	the_daemon	There you can change the hostname and interface Apache binds to
2005-10-28T14:20:00.000Z	NiGhTHiNG	the_daemon	You really should consult the docs at www.apache.org though.
2005-10-28T14:21:00.000Z	the_daemon	NiGhTHiNG	pm...
2005-10-28T14:21:00.000Z	NiGhTHiNG	the_daemon	I'm not a registered user, I can't message you.
2005-10-28T14:22:00.000Z	NiGhTHiNG	the_daemon	Thanks, but I'd rather not really
2005-10-28T14:22:00.000Z	NiGhTHiNG	the_daemon	Hang on, I've got only so many fingers to type with
2005-10-28T14:25:00.000Z	NiGhTHiNG	the_daemon	It says nothing about changing hostname in that document. It's probably not what you're looking for.
2005-10-28T14:25:00.000Z	NiGhTHiNG	the_daemon	Hang on, lemme look something up
2005-10-28T14:29:00.000Z	NiGhTHiNG	the_daemon	Okay, here's a few pointers: http://apache-server.com/tutorials/  http://www.sitepoint.com/article/installing-apache-tutorial  http://webauthv3.stanford.edu/manual/misc/tutorials.html
2005-10-28T14:30:00.000Z	NiGhTHiNG	the_daemon	You have lots of reading to do, but it's worth it. Trust me on that.
2005-10-28T14:57:00.000Z	NiGhTHiNG	the_daemon	You're awfully anxious, eh?
2005-10-28T14:57:00.000Z	NiGhTHiNG	the_daemon	What seems to be the problem?
2005-10-28T15:01:00.000Z	NiGhTHiNG	the_daemon	If Apache is not well configured it could lead to some kiddie owning your system. Hence its not enabled on anything other than loopback by default.
2005-10-28T15:02:00.000Z	NiGhTHiNG	the_daemon	That's why I told you - read before you set up a webserver.
2005-10-28T15:02:00.000Z	the_daemon	NiGhTHiNG	im setting this up for security testing...  its on a crappy PC, with 64mb RAM lol
2005-10-28T15:03:00.000Z	NiGhTHiNG	the_daemon	-shrug- If it's security testing, what's the big deal with reading how to change the Hostname and Bind directives?
2005-10-28T15:04:00.000Z	the_daemon	NiGhTHiNG	i want friends in USA (im in UK) to be able to access the sites on it....
2005-10-28T15:04:00.000Z	NiGhTHiNG	the_daemon	What is the IP address of the machine running the webserver?
