2006-11-15T14:50:00.000Z	craftybones		Hello all.
2006-11-15T14:50:00.000Z	craftybones		I have a question about automating installs
2006-11-15T14:51:00.000Z	craftybones		I am trying to build a custom CD consisting of a basic desktop server along with LAMP
2006-11-15T14:51:00.000Z	craftybones		The Wiki guide online is a little unclear about a few things. Rather I was unclear about a few things on the wiki about custom cd installs
2006-11-15T14:52:00.000Z	craftybones		The big question is how do I slip these packages into the install CD? The wiki talks about "getting debs" and "putting them in", but doesn't quite tell you how
2006-11-15T14:53:00.000Z	bimberi	craftybones	fyi, Ubuntu's server cd image includes a lamp install option
2006-11-15T14:53:00.000Z	craftybones	bimberi	thx
2006-11-15T14:53:00.000Z	craftybones	bimberi	I noticed
2006-11-15T14:53:00.000Z	craftybones	bimberi	However, there are a few other things I need to add in as well(Eclipse etc)
2006-11-15T14:54:00.000Z	craftybones	bimberi	All I would like is either an example or an idea of how to get the necessary debs(Eclipse let's say) and stick it into the pool
2006-11-15T14:55:00.000Z	bimberi	craftybones	(in case you haven't seen this) https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallCDCustomization
2006-11-15T14:55:00.000Z	craftybones	bimberi	I saw that and was unclear about how to get the debs
2006-11-15T14:57:00.000Z	bimberi	craftybones	i guess download them via http://packages.ubuntu.com
2006-11-15T14:57:00.000Z	craftybones	bimberi	that's what I thought, but didn't want to burn too many coasters before I figured it was correct or wrong
2006-11-15T14:59:00.000Z	bimberi	craftybones	yes, the page doesn't provide much detail on it :|  Use a CD-RW :)
2006-11-15T15:00:00.000Z	craftybones	bimberi	thx
2006-11-15T15:03:00.000Z	bimberi	craftybones	apt-get -d  (probably puts the the deb(s) in /var/cache/apt/archives)
2006-11-15T15:04:00.000Z	craftybones	bimberi	thx a load. I remember asking something like this in #debian a few years ago, and basically those folks made sure my computer never worked again
2006-11-15T15:05:00.000Z	bimberi	craftybones	what makes you so sure I'm not grinning evilly right now? ;)
2006-11-15T15:06:00.000Z	craftybones	bimberi	I am a few years older these days. AND its not my comp :D
2006-11-15T15:06:00.000Z	bimberi	craftybones	rofl!
