2005-12-10T12:09:00.000Z	UncleD		Hi Ubunuters.
2005-12-10T12:10:00.000Z	UncleD		Just loaded Ubuntu LiveCD on a machine and I noticed it boots into GNOME as user "ubuntu" - I wanted to mount /dev/hda1 from an existing file system (Redhat8) runing on the machine to fix a problem with libraries on that machine. It says I cannot mount without being root. How do I fix this?
2005-12-10T12:11:00.000Z	UncleD		Will sudo mount work from the user ubuntu
2005-12-10T12:11:00.000Z	UncleD		because when I tried to "su" it asked for a password?
2005-12-10T12:11:00.000Z	sladen	UncleD	sudo mount /dev/hda1 ...
2005-12-10T12:12:00.000Z	sladen	UncleD	Ubuntu is a modern unix.  We use sudo around here, just like MacOSX
2005-12-10T12:12:00.000Z	sladen	UncleD	there isn't one!
2005-12-10T12:12:00.000Z	UncleD	sladen	it requested one from me when I tried to "su root"
2005-12-10T12:12:00.000Z	sladen	UncleD	sudo !!!!
2005-12-10T12:12:00.000Z	UncleD	sladen	ill try sudo!
2005-12-10T12:12:00.000Z	sladen	UncleD	sudo mount ...
2005-12-10T12:13:00.000Z	UncleD	sladen	I haven't worked with MacOX
2005-12-10T12:13:00.000Z	sladen	UncleD	okay, well, when you do, Mac OSX is like ubuntu ;-)
2005-12-10T12:13:00.000Z	UncleD	sladen	I haven't worked with MacOSX, i've been using slackware for 7 years and then redhat for 5 (recently tried fedora but I like rh8) - now im going to go UBUNTU all the way.
2005-12-10T12:14:00.000Z	UncleD	sladen	next question before I go back to my terminal. How do I use my linksys wireless USB device plugged into my machine?
2005-12-10T12:14:00.000Z	sladen	UncleD	plug it in ;-)
2005-12-10T12:14:00.000Z	sladen	UncleD	it should "just work".  If it isn't, that's a bug and needs filing on Bugzilla
2005-12-10T12:14:00.000Z	UncleD	sladen	it doesn't work.
2005-12-10T12:16:00.000Z	sladen	UncleD	you need to config WEP with the network chooser  (System->Administration->Networking), or the little network logo at the top-right of the menu-bar
2005-12-10T12:19:00.000Z	UncleD	sladen	ok - ill check out administration->networking - in there, what should i be looking for?
2005-12-10T12:20:00.000Z	sladen	UncleD	select your wireless-card, "Propeteries", "Key"...
