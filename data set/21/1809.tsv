2010-04-25T09:22:00.000Z	electrickery		 I am new to IRC, so don't if this will work.. I am using Jaunty, and Firefox.  I have tried to install Flash.  It appears in the AddOn list ok.  But Australian ABC iView doesn't play.  Does anyone know about this?
2010-04-25T09:23:00.000Z	hoonteke	electrickery	right idea, but it ain't quite  so simple yet.  Instead, go to System->Administration->Synaptic.
2010-04-25T09:23:00.000Z	hoonteke	electrickery	when it opens, search for 'flashplugin' in the search bar
2010-04-25T09:24:00.000Z	hoonteke	electrickery	then select flashplugin-nonfree
2010-04-25T09:24:00.000Z	hoonteke	electrickery	mark it for installation, then click apply.  It should go download, and install it automagically.
2010-04-25T09:24:00.000Z	hoonteke	electrickery	then restart firefox and you should be good to go
2010-04-25T09:26:00.000Z	electrickery	hoonteke	 I only installed flashplugin installer.  Should I uninstall that before installing nonfree?
2010-04-25T09:27:00.000Z	hoonteke	electrickery	I ... don't konw.  yes.  The worst that'll happen is that you have to reinstall it, so give it a try.  uninstall flashplugin installer, and install flashplugin-nonfree
2010-04-25T09:27:00.000Z	electrickery	hoonteke	 Thanks. I'll give it a go.
2010-04-25T09:35:00.000Z	hoonteke	electrickery	that do the trick?
2010-04-25T09:37:00.000Z	electrickery	hoonteke	 No, sadly.  It did bring in the  flashplugin installer again, all looks good, but the site I am trying to vies dousnt work http://www.abc.net.au/iview/
2010-04-25T09:38:00.000Z	hoonteke	electrickery	hmm. it works for me, so there's something we're missing ... what kernel are you running?  If you can open up a terminal and type 'uname -a' ...
2010-04-25T09:41:00.000Z	electrickery	hoonteke	2.6.28-18-generic ???
2010-04-25T09:41:00.000Z	hoonteke	electrickery	what's the full output of the uname -a.  not just the version number, please.
2010-04-25T09:46:00.000Z	electrickery	hoonteke	2.6.28-18-generic #60-Ubuntu SMP Fri Mar 12 04:40:52 UTC 2010 i686 GNU/Linux
2010-04-25T09:47:00.000Z	hoonteke	electrickery	good, hmm, so that's *not* a 64-bit machine?
2010-04-25T09:48:00.000Z	electrickery	hoonteke	Don't reckon.. Acer Aspire 3000 AMD Sempron 2800
2010-04-25T09:51:00.000Z	hoonteke	electrickery	I don't know that hardware, but I'll take your word for it
2010-04-25T09:53:00.000Z	hoonteke	electrickery	generally, thanks to adobe not support 64 bit until very recently, the 32bit flash has been way stronger than 64 bit flash, so I'm surprised it isn't working.  my only real advice is to keep googling with the search terms relevant to your situation: jaunty flash.
2010-04-25T09:53:00.000Z	hoonteke	electrickery	sorry, I run a 64bit machine, and dont' have handy a 32bit machine to test with.
2010-04-25T09:54:00.000Z	electrickery	hoonteke	 Thanks.. I'll keep looking.
