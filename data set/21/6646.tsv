2007-02-25T12:15:00.000Z	Quintin	fletch007	what video card and drivers?
2007-02-25T12:16:00.000Z	Quintin	fletch007	paste your Xorg logs and conf files
2007-02-25T12:17:00.000Z	Quintin	fletch007	/var/log/ is where they are at...
2007-02-25T12:29:00.000Z	Quintin	fletch007	the conf file is /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-02-25T12:31:00.000Z	Quintin	fletch007	link
2007-02-25T12:34:00.000Z	fletch007	Quintin	- here is the other one http://pastebin.ca/371291
2007-02-25T12:54:00.000Z	fletch007	Quintin	I can see that you are very busy--- I was reading throug the xorg.conf file and it says BusID "PCI:1:0:0" . now I know that my video card is an AGP card, could that be causing my troubles?
2007-02-25T12:56:00.000Z	Quintin	fletch007	it should be PCI .. even for agp
2007-02-25T12:56:00.000Z	fletch007	Quintin	thanks, I will keep looking
2007-02-25T12:56:00.000Z	Quintin	fletch007	do a dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and follow the prompts.
2007-02-25T12:56:00.000Z	Quintin	fletch007	what kind of monitor do you have?
2007-02-25T12:57:00.000Z	fletch007	Quintin	the monitor is a P225f - ViewSonic
2007-02-25T12:59:00.000Z	Quintin	fletch007	your xorg.conf is ... funny.  Do sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg in text mode and follow the prompts
2007-02-25T12:59:00.000Z	fletch007	Quintin	I will give it a shot thanks
2007-02-25T13:17:00.000Z	fletch007	Quintin	ok I am through the reconfig of the xorg. so now I just reboot? and see?
2007-02-25T13:17:00.000Z	Quintin	fletch007	just ctrl + alt + backspace
2007-02-25T13:19:00.000Z	fletch007	Quintin	it seems to have worked . I am now at 1280x1024
2007-02-25T13:20:00.000Z	Quintin	fletch007	super.  tips are welcome :P
2007-02-25T13:21:00.000Z	fletch007	Quintin	so I will try to boot straight up and see if it hangs at the login screen. I have a good workaround to get back here if it does. thanks so much for your help. send me that link again so I can contribute to your cause.
2007-02-25T13:22:00.000Z	Quintin	fletch007	link?  uhm.. daecom.biz is my website.  not much there ;)
