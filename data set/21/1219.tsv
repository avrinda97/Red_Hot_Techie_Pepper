2010-12-22T10:12:00.000Z	cooper|laptop		hi, I'm trying to install ubuntu 64bit desktop on an sata 6g drive. the livecd installer shows the ubuntu logo and then takes me to the initramfs shell and says that no drive is detected with the livecd data on it.
2010-12-22T10:13:00.000Z	alpha255	cooper|laptop	does the gparted tool show the drive?
2010-12-22T10:15:00.000Z	cooper|laptop	alpha255	how can i check ?
2010-12-22T10:16:00.000Z	cooper|laptop	alpha255	yes, but how?
2010-12-22T10:18:00.000Z	alpha255	cooper|laptop	in terminal window type   gparted
2010-12-22T10:18:00.000Z	cooper|laptop	alpha255	how..? there is nothing installed :p
2010-12-22T10:19:00.000Z	alpha255	cooper|laptop	your in the gui dektop on the live cd right?
2010-12-22T10:20:00.000Z	cooper|laptop	alpha255	no, as i said, it just takes me to the initramfs shell and says that no drive is detected with the livecd data on it.
2010-12-22T10:20:00.000Z	alpha255	cooper|laptop	   what version of the live cd?
2010-12-22T10:21:00.000Z	cooper|laptop	alpha255	it's the amd64 desktop installer for maverick on the website
2010-12-22T10:22:00.000Z	cooper|laptop	alpha255	it's not a laptop
2010-12-22T10:23:00.000Z	alpha255	cooper|laptop	what type of hardware ?
2010-12-22T10:23:00.000Z	alpha255	cooper|laptop	is it a newly build custom machine?
2010-12-22T10:24:00.000Z	cooper|laptop	alpha255	it's an asus p7p55d-e lx motherboard and an intel i7
2010-12-22T10:24:00.000Z	alpha255	cooper|laptop	pretty new then
2010-12-22T10:28:00.000Z	alpha255	cooper|laptop	looks like it should work ... http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1567023&highlight=ASUS+P7P55D
2010-12-22T10:29:00.000Z	cooper|laptop	alpha255	i just realized that the sata 6g has a separate option from the sata ii controller in the bios settings.. lemme look and see if this changes anything
2010-12-22T10:29:00.000Z	alpha255	cooper|laptop	yes, the bios would be next to look at
2010-12-22T10:31:00.000Z	cooper|laptop	alpha255	it was set to IDE. I didn't see it before.. for some reason they decided to put it in the advanced settings/onboard devices/jmicron controller :p
2010-12-22T10:31:00.000Z	cooper|laptop	alpha255	thanks for your help; it's working now
2010-12-22T10:31:00.000Z	alpha255	cooper|laptop	NICE :)
