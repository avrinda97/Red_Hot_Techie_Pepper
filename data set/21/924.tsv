2011-04-15T18:09:00.000Z	fisix		why does my ethernet card seem to have 2 mac addresses, leading to my router not assigning the static ip sometimes?
2011-04-15T18:09:00.000Z	spannerotoole	fisix	have you got two ethernet cards?
2011-04-15T18:10:00.000Z	fisix	spannerotoole	it's a laptop so it has a wireless and an ethernet. it shouldn't have "two ethernet cards" to my knowledge..
2011-04-15T18:10:00.000Z	spannerotoole	fisix	the wireless card is considered to be a network card
2011-04-15T18:11:00.000Z	fisix	spannerotoole	lol i get that. but i'm not on wireless, it's switched off. just on ethernet
2011-04-15T18:11:00.000Z	spannerotoole	fisix	open terminal and type sudo ifconfig
2011-04-15T18:15:00.000Z	spannerotoole	fisix	it sounds like you are filtering by mac address
2011-04-15T18:15:00.000Z	fisix	spannerotoole	no because once i unplug the ethernet c0rd and replug, it will assign the static ip since the ifconfig displays a diff mac address. wats going on...
2011-04-15T18:16:00.000Z	spannerotoole	fisix	your mac address is fixed as it's built into the card
2011-04-15T18:18:00.000Z	spannerotoole	fisix	as you have two network interfaces, you need to allow both mac addresses into your router
2011-04-15T18:21:00.000Z	fisix	spannerotoole	when i unplug/replug the cord, the mac address in eth0 changes to the one i've assigned a static ip in the router
2011-04-15T18:22:00.000Z	spannerotoole	fisix	what happens if its plugged in and you do a cold boot
2011-04-15T18:23:00.000Z	fisix	spannerotoole	it gets set to that aa:00:04:00:0a:04 address which i haven't assigned a static ip for
2011-04-15T18:27:00.000Z	spannerotoole	fisix	have you checked your configs in /etc
2011-04-15T18:29:00.000Z	spannerotoole	fisix	i'm asking
2011-04-15T18:29:00.000Z	spannerotoole	fisix	have you checked your configs in /etc
2011-04-15T18:30:00.000Z	fisix	spannerotoole	sorry, was trying to see what these configs are lol. ummm i have not. wat do u want me to check?
2011-04-15T18:30:00.000Z	spannerotoole	fisix	have you set a static ip address?
2011-04-15T18:31:00.000Z	fisix	spannerotoole	i've set the static ip address in my router, assigning the mac address which only comes up after unplug/replug
2011-04-15T18:33:00.000Z	fisix	spannerotoole	i guess i could assign both mac addresses to the same ip (if the router lets me), but i'm just curious why it's even doing this in the first place...
2011-04-15T18:36:00.000Z	spannerotoole	fisix	PM'd you
