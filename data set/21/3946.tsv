2008-08-15T21:39:00.000Z	noam	isharis	Are you using envy or Nvidia's drivers?
2008-08-15T21:41:00.000Z	noam	isharis	ps ax|grep nautilus
2008-08-15T21:41:00.000Z	isharis	noam	Why do I have to use that hack?
2008-08-15T21:41:00.000Z	noam	isharis	That's not a hack
2008-08-15T21:41:00.000Z	noam	isharis	It tells you whether nautilus is running
2008-08-15T21:42:00.000Z	isharis	noam	What's up with nautilus? Is it really naughty? :(
2008-08-15T21:42:00.000Z	noam	isharis	Nautilus manages the desktop under GNOME
2008-08-15T21:43:00.000Z	noam	isharis	So if the wallpaper doesn't appear, nautilus may have crashed
2008-08-15T21:43:00.000Z	isharis	noam	so how do I fix it? :O
2008-08-15T21:43:00.000Z	noam	isharis	First, check if that is the case
2008-08-15T21:43:00.000Z	noam	isharis	Run ps ax|grep nautilus
