2009-12-16T19:39:00.000Z	miha		how to 'force' removal of broken package?
2009-12-16T19:39:00.000Z	miha		or at least stop it from preventing installing other packages
2009-12-16T19:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	miha	sudo dpkg --force-all -r packagename     may work
2009-12-16T19:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	miha	I suggest you get to a squared system will all satisfied deps, then gracefully remove it
2009-12-16T19:41:00.000Z	miha	ActionParsnip1	nope
2009-12-16T19:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	miha	can you give me a little more feedback, i'm not psychic
2009-12-16T19:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	miha	why not be useful and pastebin the output?
2009-12-16T19:42:00.000Z	miha	ActionParsnip1	and this before: ERROR: /var/lib/boinc is not owned by boinc.               [FAILED] invoke-rc.d: initscript boinc-client, action "start" failed.
2009-12-16T19:42:00.000Z	miha	ActionParsnip1	now i'd like to remove that and build svn version :D
2009-12-16T19:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	miha	sudo chown boinc /var/lib/boinc
2009-12-16T19:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	miha	then try again
2009-12-16T19:44:00.000Z	miha	ActionParsnip1	http://pastebin.com/m53d69abc the whole thing
2009-12-16T19:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	miha	and after the chown?
2009-12-16T19:46:00.000Z	miha	ActionParsnip1	damn i always manage to crash something... after trying screen magnifier to see if my aunt can use gnome... i have virtual deskop twice the width
2009-12-16T19:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	miha	run it with gksudo
2009-12-16T19:47:00.000Z	miha	ActionParsnip1	well i'm not complete noob but still didnt think of that :D
2009-12-16T19:47:00.000Z	miha	ActionParsnip1	i guess it should be default to ask :D
2009-12-16T19:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	miha	lots of things should something but dont, you can edit your menus or reate aliases to commands
2009-12-16T19:48:00.000Z	miha	ActionParsnip1	well i just say here in hope some of the more canonical folks would notice
2009-12-16T19:50:00.000Z	miha	ActionParsnip1	could i somehow just delete it from installed db?
2009-12-16T19:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	miha	there is but i am unsure of the method and I don't agree with it but sometimes its the only way to go
