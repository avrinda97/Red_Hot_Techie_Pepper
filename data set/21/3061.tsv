2009-04-25T03:34:00.000Z	losher	PlasmaSheep	I would boot up the live cd and check the entry in /boot/grub/menu.lst.
2009-04-25T03:35:00.000Z	PlasmaSheep	losher	check for what?
2009-04-25T03:35:00.000Z	PlasmaSheep	losher	check for what?
2009-04-25T03:36:00.000Z	losher	PlasmaSheep	there should be a line beginning with 'kernel'. It names the root partition by uuid. You need to check that the uuid is correct
2009-04-25T03:37:00.000Z	PlasmaSheep	losher	It says something along the lines (at startup) that the uuid of the root partition is wrong. What should I do if the uuid is incorrect?
2009-04-25T03:38:00.000Z	losher	PlasmaSheep	you must find the correct uuid and edit it into the file where it says 'kernel....root=UUID=<some uuid> ro quiet splash'
2009-04-25T03:38:00.000Z	PlasmaSheep	losher	how would I find the right uuid?
2009-04-25T03:40:00.000Z	losher	PlasmaSheep	the command vol_id <partition> will tell you the uuid...
2009-04-25T03:41:00.000Z	losher	PlasmaSheep	mrwes is right, blkid is better than vol_id
2009-04-25T03:41:00.000Z	losher	PlasmaSheep	You may have to make an inspired guess about which is the root partitiion though
2009-04-25T03:42:00.000Z	PlasmaSheep	losher	Is there a general guidline on how it's done?
2009-04-25T03:43:00.000Z	losher	PlasmaSheep	I don't know of a good one. You could spend months reading web pages about grub and booting...
2009-04-25T04:07:00.000Z	losher	PlasmaSheep	so you fixed something?
2009-04-25T04:09:00.000Z	PlasmaSheep	losher	not yet. I'm in the process of writing the downloaded image to a disk.
2009-04-25T04:11:00.000Z	losher	PlasmaSheep	ah, when you said burning a dvd, I thought you mean from kdenlive
