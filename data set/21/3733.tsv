2008-10-09T03:38:00.000Z	drich0		My backtick/tilde key only works if I hit it twice (not a dirty/sticky key -- consistently works if i hit it twice).  any ideas?
2008-10-09T03:39:00.000Z	drich0		don't think so
2008-10-09T03:39:00.000Z	drich0		otherwise i would think it wouldn't work consistently with two presses
2008-10-09T03:39:00.000Z	LjL	drich0	you're using an international layout
2008-10-09T03:39:00.000Z	drich0	LjL	no
2008-10-09T03:39:00.000Z	LjL	drich0	try hitting it and then hitting Space
2008-10-09T03:40:00.000Z	drich0	LjL	yes, that works
2008-10-09T03:40:00.000Z	LjL	drich0	you're using an international layout - i insist
2008-10-09T03:40:00.000Z	LjL	drich0	like US International, if you're in the US
2008-10-09T03:40:00.000Z	drich0	LjL	If i hit the backtick key then space, it outputs the backtick.  OK, so it's international then, how do i change that?
2008-10-09T03:40:00.000Z	LjL	drich0	try hitting it and then hitting the letter "n" - you'll probably see what this is about
2008-10-09T03:41:00.000Z	drich0	LjL	I hit backtick then "n", nothing
2008-10-09T03:42:00.000Z	LjL	drich0	meant tilde, not backtick. anyway you can also try backtick and then "a"
2008-10-09T03:42:00.000Z	drich0	LjL	Yes, i tried backtick then 'a' and got an a with an accent
2008-10-09T03:43:00.000Z	drich0	LjL	How do I turn off the international layout?
2008-10-09T03:43:00.000Z	LjL	drich0	precisely. what's happening is that you have a keyboard layout that uses "combining" characters: if you hit ~ and then "n", you get ñ. if you hit ` and then "a", you get à. and several other combinations
2008-10-09T03:43:00.000Z	LjL	drich0	i'm not on GNOME, but i have another computer that has it, so hold on a second and i'll check
2008-10-09T03:43:00.000Z	drich0	LjL	Great, thanks
2008-10-09T03:46:00.000Z	LjL	drich0	i can't find it precisely, as i don't have a US keyboard myself... but i really think it's a matter of selecting "US" instead of "US Intl", or instead of "US with dead keys", though i can only guess
2008-10-09T03:47:00.000Z	drich0	LjL	Got it.  Thanks a million.  That was driving me nuts.  I looks like 'USA International (with dead keys)' was set up instead of 'USA (Default)'
2008-10-09T03:47:00.000Z	LjL	drich0	yes, that would be it.
