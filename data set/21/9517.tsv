2006-01-08T16:48:00.000Z	cary		does anyone have an idea why my synaptic package manager wont open? when i select it (default breezy install) it requests authentication but the synaptic window im used to doesnt come up. nothing appears to happen
2006-01-08T16:49:00.000Z	odat	cary	sounds like a gdm problem
2006-01-08T16:49:00.000Z	cary	odat	what doesnt mean a whole lot to me. im fairly new at this (ive sucessfully installed it once on a powerbook, and now this time on a PC). any suggestion as to where to start to figure out how to fix it?
2006-01-08T16:50:00.000Z	odat	cary	try sudo apt-get install gdm    in the terminal
2006-01-08T16:51:00.000Z	cary	odat	ran that, authenticated, and it went to the next line. i see no network activity or anyting happening
2006-01-08T16:52:00.000Z	cary	odat	polpak , i dont even get any error return when i have bad syntax trying to apt-get
2006-01-08T16:52:00.000Z	cary	odat	i get the password box, just not the package manager
2006-01-08T16:53:00.000Z	odat	cary	oh ok did you reinstall synaptic?
2006-01-08T16:53:00.000Z	cary	odat	ive not installed anything at all since my initial setup of this ubuntu system (last night i think it was. maybe two days ago). how would i reinstall it?
2006-01-08T16:55:00.000Z	cary	odat	i found the site where i could get the debian files, but i mean then what..compile? dont really know how if thats whats next. ahah
2006-01-08T16:56:00.000Z	odat	cary	don't have to just open up the terminal and type sudo apt-get install synaptic
2006-01-08T16:56:00.000Z	cary	odat	it says this: cary is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.
2006-01-08T16:57:00.000Z	odat	cary	do you have multiple user on your system?
2006-01-08T16:57:00.000Z	cary	odat	just root and cary ..thats it
2006-01-08T16:58:00.000Z	odat	cary	sounds like cary doesn't have permmision to make changes
2006-01-08T16:59:00.000Z	cary	odat	is there a way to make that happen?
2006-01-08T16:59:00.000Z	odat	cary	are you on the machine right now   is it connected to the internet?
2006-01-09T17:02:00.000Z	cary	odat	im goign to paste what it said when i ran that install as root
2006-01-09T17:02:00.000Z	odat	cary	don't know why your running this as root
2006-01-09T17:03:00.000Z	cary	odat	well it was the only thing i could think of after you said "cary doesnt seem to have permission" or whatever
2006-01-09T17:04:00.000Z	cary	odat	i ran apt-get update and then i was notifed of the new updates via the gui  but i still cant see my synaptic
