2011-12-15T20:49:00.000Z	omid__		MonkeyDust,when i installed ubuntu the preconfigured download server was the server of Iran. i changed that to the server of the United states.

2011-12-15T20:53:00.000Z	omid__		i have downloaded the official drivers from AMD's website.
2011-12-15T20:53:00.000Z	omid__		arent they safe? isnt AMD website safe?
2011-12-15T20:55:00.000Z	omid__		there is 2 options. one is ATI/AMD propritary FGLRX graphics driver(post-release updates) and the other one is ATI/AMD propritary FGLRX graphics driver.
2011-12-15T20:55:00.000Z	omid__		which one should i install?
2011-12-15T20:55:00.000Z	omid__		i hope i dont get that error this time
2011-12-15T20:56:00.000Z	soreau	omid__	You dont need to install the proprietary driver at all since the default is the open radeon driver
2011-12-15T20:56:00.000Z	omid__	soreau	 i'm sorry to say that but opensource drivers for ATI cards SUCK BIG TIME. too much system heat and power usage for me
2011-12-15T20:57:00.000Z	soreau	omid__	You can choose deferent power profiles for the driver
2011-12-15T21:16:00.000Z	soreau	omid__	lsmod|egrep "radeon|fglrx"
2011-12-15T21:17:00.000Z	soreau	omid__	You dont need adobe products to view pdf documents
2011-12-15T21:18:00.000Z	omid__	soreau	 i need them . evince sucks and okular is good but they dont show complicated PDF files like 3d pdfs and pdf's containing audio which i use in my job
2011-12-15T21:18:00.000Z	soreau	omid__	If you think everything sucks, go use some other os
2011-12-15T21:19:00.000Z	omid__	soreau	 nonsense. just because an app is not good dosnt mean that the Whole OS is bad.
2011-12-15T21:20:00.000Z	soreau	omid__	get lost
2011-12-15T21:21:00.000Z	omid__	soreau	 i'm sorry if i made you angry. i didnt wanted to do that. please be polite. there is no need to fight
2011-12-15T21:23:00.000Z	omid__	soreau	anyway i didnt wanted to fight with you. i'm sorry
2011-12-15T21:23:00.000Z	soreau	omid__	I SAID QUIT TALKING TO ME
