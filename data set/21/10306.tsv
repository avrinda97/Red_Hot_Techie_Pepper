2005-04-07T11:11:00.000Z	PacoBCN	Savant	apache2-mpm-prefork, libapache2-mod-php4 and php4-mysql have to be uninstalled...
2005-04-07T11:12:00.000Z	Savant		and this is when you upgrade apache2, not apache right?
2005-04-07T11:12:00.000Z	PacoBCN	Savant	apache2, correct
2005-04-07T11:13:00.000Z	PacoBCN	Savant	but there is also an update of apache2-mpm-prefork :)
2005-04-07T11:13:00.000Z	PacoBCN	Savant	which is one of the packs to delete
2005-04-07T11:15:00.000Z	Savant		hmmm it didnt make be do it PacoBCN
2005-04-07T11:15:00.000Z	Savant		upgraded as usual...

2005-04-07T11:15:00.000Z	PacoBCN		ok, I'll upgrade too
2005-04-07T11:16:00.000Z	Savant		do you maybe have an extra repository that might host apache2?
2005-04-07T11:17:00.000Z	Savant	PacoBCN	do you maybe have an extra repository that might host apache2?
2005-04-07T11:17:00.000Z	PacoBCN	Savant	I think I solved it
2005-04-07T11:17:00.000Z	PacoBCN	Savant	after synaptic marked it as pack to delete I forced it to upgrade it again
2005-04-07T11:17:00.000Z	PacoBCN	Savant	seems to have worked so far
2005-04-07T11:18:00.000Z	PacoBCN	Savant	yes, it's all right
2005-04-07T11:18:00.000Z	Savant	PacoBCN	awesome
