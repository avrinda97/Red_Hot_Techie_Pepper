2008-08-10T05:23:00.000Z	GlimDanten		Also, my wireless card worked fine for 7.10 but when I installed 8.04, it did not
2008-08-10T05:23:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	GlimDanten	well, there's a lot of wireless cards out there, perhaps you could narrow it down
2008-08-10T05:36:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	GlimDanten	again, what wireless adapter do you have?

2008-08-10T05:41:00.000Z	GlimDanten	IndyGunFreak	That will require a reboot?
2008-08-10T05:44:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	GlimDanten	and what was the other problem?
2008-08-10T05:46:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	GlimDanten	well, what is the CD of?
2008-08-10T05:47:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	GlimDanten	well i don't see why you'd need either of those from a CD, just download the updates since your wireless is working
2008-08-10T05:48:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	GlimDanten	i see.
2008-08-10T05:49:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	GlimDanten	well plug the thumb drive in, give it a second, then run lsusb in a terminal and see if you see an entry for it.
2008-08-10T05:51:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	GlimDanten	does your user have access to external drives?
2008-08-10T05:52:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	GlimDanten	system/admin/users and groups... click unlock, enter password, highlight your user, click password, and look at user priv.
2008-08-10T05:53:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	GlimDanten	second part should be click *properties*... not click passwword, then click user priv. tab
2008-08-10T05:53:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	GlimDanten	is the thumb drive plugged in right now?
2008-08-10T05:54:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	GlimDanten	got o Places/Computer.. then click on Filesystem, and look in the /media folder... (witht he thumb drive plugged in)
2008-08-10T05:55:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	GlimDanten	dunno to be truthful... what filesystem is the thumb drive formatted as?.. NTFS?
2008-08-10T05:58:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	GlimDanten	i really don't know.. doesn't make sense... do you have something else USB you could try?
2008-08-10T05:58:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	GlimDanten	the fact lsusb showed no output when the drive was plugged in,s ays its not being seen at all,
2008-08-10T05:59:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	GlimDanten	wel, your desktop doesn't have Linux on it if i understand correctly
2008-08-10T05:59:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	GlimDanten	i didn't suggest the problem was the flash drive
2008-08-10T06:02:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	GlimDanten	i bet your usb ports aren't working.. do you have somethig real simple, like maybe a USB mouse, you could plug into the port, see if it works?
