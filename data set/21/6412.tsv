2010-04-12T01:36:00.000Z	icedwater		Hello, does anyone know how I can run fsck on my filesystems if recovery mode refuses to cooperate?
2010-04-12T01:37:00.000Z	ikonia	icedwater	explain the problem properly please
2010-04-12T01:37:00.000Z	icedwater		There is a "General error mounting filesystems" and the system offers to go into maintenance mode, asking me to press Ctrl-D or enter the root password for maintenance.
2010-04-12T01:37:00.000Z	icedwater		This occurs shortly after I boot into recovery, regardless of what I do.
2010-04-12T01:38:00.000Z	ikonia	icedwater	explain the problem
2010-04-12T01:38:00.000Z	icedwater		I had some random power loss, which I am assuming is due to a hardware issue (probably the adapter has gone loose)
2010-04-12T01:39:00.000Z	icedwater		So I decided to do a filesystem check to see if everything was all right
2010-04-12T01:39:00.000Z	icedwater		But I couldn't boot into single-user aka recovery mode
2010-04-12T01:39:00.000Z	ikonia	icedwater	what is the error ?
2010-04-12T01:39:00.000Z	icedwater		Well, I could, but I couldn't get any of the options to work because a "General error mounting filesystems" would occur
2010-04-12T01:39:00.000Z	icedwater		Regardless of what I did.
2010-04-12T01:40:00.000Z	ikonia	icedwater	you don't run fsck on a mounted file system
2010-04-12T01:40:00.000Z	icedwater	ikonia	"General error mounting filesystems"
2010-04-12T01:40:00.000Z	ikonia	icedwater	you need to do it from a recovery / live CD
2010-04-12T01:40:00.000Z	icedwater	ikonia	can I not unmount it from recovery mode?
2010-04-12T01:40:00.000Z	ikonia	icedwater	no because you are using that file system to boot recovery mode
2010-04-12T01:40:00.000Z	icedwater		Thought so...
2010-04-12T01:41:00.000Z	icedwater		But that doesn't explain the "General error mounting filesystems" error message, though does it?
2010-04-12T01:41:00.000Z	ikonia	icedwater	it does if there is damage to the file systems
2010-04-12T01:41:00.000Z	icedwater		What does?
2010-04-12T01:42:00.000Z	ikonia	icedwater	if there is file system damage, that explains the general mounting error
