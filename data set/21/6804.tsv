2011-01-30T08:08:00.000Z	kmc		hi, i'm interested in creating an ubuntu installer USB stick without deleting what's on my USB stick or using fancy GNOME software
2011-01-30T08:08:00.000Z	kmc		i just want to put vmlinuz and initrd and an iso image on the stick, as i do with debian
2011-01-30T08:08:00.000Z	kmc		is this possible?
2011-01-30T08:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	kmc	Yes.
2011-01-30T08:11:00.000Z	kmc		will unetbootin delete my exitsing files a3ther_?
2011-01-30T08:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	kmc	No.
2011-01-30T08:11:00.000Z	kmc	Jordan_U	could you elaborate please?
2011-01-30T08:12:00.000Z	kmc		i set iso to load the initrd and kernel i copied from the install cd, but it complains that it "can't find medium with live filesystem"
2011-01-30T08:12:00.000Z	kmc		i set isolinux*
2011-01-30T08:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	kmc	The easiest way to do it is to use unetbootin or Ubuntu's "Startup Disk Creator", neither of which will delete existing files. If for some reason that's not acceptable (why?) then you can copy the iso to the flash drive, create a grub.cfg as explained here: http://www.supergrubdisk.org/wiki/Loopback.cfg#How_do_you_use_a_loopback.cfg_to_boot_an_iso.3F then install grub2 to the drive with grub-install.
2011-01-30T08:13:00.000Z	kmc		nice, thank you Jordan_U
2011-01-30T08:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	kmc	You're welcome.
2011-01-30T08:40:00.000Z	kmc	Jordan_U	I pressed the wrong button in unetbootin and it wrote to my system's boot drive.  that's why i don't like fancy GNOME utilities
2011-01-30T08:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	kmc	Do you need help fixing it?
2011-01-30T08:42:00.000Z	kmc	Jordan_U	well, i removed the files it wrote there, and re-installed my system grub to that device
2011-01-30T08:42:00.000Z	kmc		i hope it works
2011-01-30T08:42:00.000Z	kmc		so nobody here can just tell me what unetbootin is going to do to my stick, so i can do it myself?
2011-01-30T08:42:00.000Z	kmc		if it's supposedly safe
2011-01-30T08:43:00.000Z	kmc		also the unetbootin packaged in debian doesn't have 10.10
2011-01-30T08:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	kmc	If you're doing it manually the grub2 route is easier.
2011-01-30T08:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	kmc	If your flash drive were "/dev/sdb" then it would basically be: sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt; sudo cp /path/to/ubuntu_10.10.iso /mnt/; sudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sdb; sudo vi /mnt/boot/grub/grub.cfg" where the grub.cfg would follow the template here: http://www.supergrubdisk.org/wiki/Loopback.cfg#How_do_you_use_a_loopback.cfg_to_boot_an_iso.3F
