2007-02-24T09:55:00.000Z	Kannaida		so... I'm looking to "break into" the linux world (this is my first time on IRC even).  Kinda tired of being locked into M$ developer role... is Ubuntu a good place to start?
2007-02-24T09:55:00.000Z	Kannaida		I know you're biased... I'm hoping for a bit of honesty and some help
2007-02-24T09:55:00.000Z	Kannaida		I think Ubuntu is the right choice for me, just not sure if it's the right starting choice
2007-02-24T09:56:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kannaida	Ubuntu is a really good place for newbies to start because you can't really hurt yourself with gnome, and because the community is so helpful.
2007-02-24T09:59:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kannaida	Java is cross-platform. No problems with that.
2007-02-24T10:00:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kannaida	Gaming is a huge problem. There's a couple simple games for Linux available. Wine will also run a few windows games. But for the most part you're better off dual-booting or having a gaming box.
2007-02-24T10:00:00.000Z	Kannaida	arrenlex	thanx.  well, I like to game... but I guess it's not really my top priority
2007-02-24T10:02:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kannaida	Unix? Is that that expensive thing they had in the '80s?
2007-02-24T10:03:00.000Z	Kannaida	arrenlex	yep, and at my college... so much not fun to go from that to a job that says "oh, you know MFC, right?"
2007-02-24T10:06:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kannaida	No. The UI is handled by toolkit libraries: the main ones are gtk and qt, and those are available on all modern distros and even on windows.
2007-02-24T10:07:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kannaida	Where you get into problems is the different libraries. Often the versions of the libraries are different between distros and they change with time since there's nothing like in windows where they have to keep exact compatibilty or corporate vendors will yell at them.
2007-02-24T10:07:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kannaida	That's why a lot of software on Linux is either distributed from source or downloaded directly from the distro repositories.
2007-02-24T10:08:00.000Z	Kannaida	arrenlex	so I would be better off knowing which distro(s) I could be developing for?
2007-02-24T10:08:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kannaida	So you would be better off writing open source. :)
2007-02-24T10:09:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kannaida	What are you laughing at?
2007-02-24T10:09:00.000Z	Kannaida	arrenlex	how far this all is from what I *thought* I knew...
2007-02-24T10:12:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kannaida	It was really tough when I switched to Linux and I had no idea how to even give a file path. I had no idea how the filesystem syntax worked. I had to learn to use the command line even though I'd never even seen it before!
2007-02-24T10:12:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kannaida	But I figured it out and I'd never go back now :)
2007-02-24T10:13:00.000Z	Kannaida	arrenlex	That's actually really comforting. I know I'll still need a Windows box for some of my work, but it's really quite intimidating.
2007-02-24T10:13:00.000Z	arrenlex	Kannaida	Just keep trying and ask over here if you need help :) you'll get it in no time.
2007-02-24T10:13:00.000Z	Kannaida	arrenlex	thanks
