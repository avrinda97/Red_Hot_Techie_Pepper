2006-06-19T15:49:00.000Z	Phenom	jneves	i'm not getting an error its just allowing me to view the secured document anyways?
2006-06-19T15:50:00.000Z	jneves	Phenom	2 options: apache isn't configured to use .htaccess or you have the require/satisfy directives wrong
2006-06-19T15:50:00.000Z	Phenom	jneves	hmm
2006-06-19T15:51:00.000Z	Phenom	jneves	I'm following this tutorial exactally though
2006-06-19T15:51:00.000Z	jneves	Phenom	that's why I said to put the result on the pastebin - it's easier for me to debug it and then explain you what's wrong...
2006-06-19T15:51:00.000Z	jneves	Phenom	not all tutorials are current for apache 2
