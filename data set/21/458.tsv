2011-12-18T13:22:00.000Z	hot2trot		I'm sorry for being so noob, but my computer won't jump to the regular ubuntu sign-in screen, so I alt-ctrl F2 and login in there, then I try to do a gnome-session, or use mplayer, or any of that, I get an error saying "Cannot open display"... what is my problem, just so I know where to start digging
2011-12-18T13:23:00.000Z	tresk	hot2trot	what have you done befor this happend?
2011-12-18T13:24:00.000Z	hot2trot	tresk	let my friend do some stuff to the server and he communicated with it headlessly =( I know don't let other poele do stuff without knowing what they are doing exactly.  He upgraded from 9.10 to 10.04
2011-12-18T13:25:00.000Z	tresk	hot2trot	have you played with graphics settings? Try to rename "/etc/X11/xorg.conf" to "xorg.conf.old"

2011-12-18T13:26:00.000Z	hot2trot	tresk	so do that and restart?
2011-12-18T13:27:00.000Z	tresk	hot2trot	yes try it with restart
2011-12-18T13:30:00.000Z	tresk	hot2trot	if that doesn't do the job rename it back and follow soreau's instructions or do "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
2011-12-18T13:36:00.000Z	hot2trot	tresk	I just rebooted the computer, just to be clear, your initial suggestion is to "mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.old" and then restart, and let the system make a new one?
2011-12-18T13:37:00.000Z	tresk	hot2trot	yes, and it doesn't make a new one
2011-12-18T13:37:00.000Z	tresk	hot2trot	only if it the gdm isn't comiong up again, try "dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
2011-12-18T13:39:00.000Z	tresk	hot2trot	In my case I could only start gdm if I hadn't any xorg.conf :)
2011-12-18T13:40:00.000Z	hot2trot	tresk	well it's an even worse problem because whenever I start the computer, half the time I jsut get some text at the top flashing and being weird... I smell a reformat coming up =(
2011-12-18T13:49:00.000Z	tresk	hot2trot	maybe it's a good time to make a backup of /home and /etc now ,)
2011-12-18T13:50:00.000Z	hot2trot	tresk	lol, it's okay, it's a "toy" computer, making it an htpc, this is my last shot before the dreaded reformat
2011-12-18T13:50:00.000Z	tresk	hot2trot	so go for Oneiric then ,)
2011-12-18T13:51:00.000Z	hot2trot	tresk	wanna, but I have a fitpc2 and the only support they have for how to compile mplayer with video acceleration is using 9.10
2011-12-18T13:56:00.000Z	tresk	hot2trot	is that your problem? http://bit.ly/swXDkh
2011-12-18T14:00:00.000Z	hot2trot	tresk	are you asking if that's the problem with me running oneirc?
2011-12-18T14:01:00.000Z	hot2trot	tresk	also, I did the xorg move and now I get a big black screen...
2011-12-18T14:05:00.000Z	tresk	hot2trot	but you can switch to cli?!
