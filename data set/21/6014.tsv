2007-07-13T05:31:00.000Z	unagi_		what is the actual comand issued when you press ctrl + alt + backspace
2007-07-13T05:32:00.000Z	unagi_		i know what it does im asking for the command that is issued
2007-07-13T05:33:00.000Z	unagi_		sigh
2007-07-13T05:34:00.000Z	jgoguen	unagi_	are you using Gnome or KDE
2007-07-13T05:35:00.000Z	jgoguen	unagi_	there is no specific command sent by Ctrl+Alt+Backspace, but you can get the same effect by switching to another terminal, logging in, and giving the command 'sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart'
2007-07-13T05:36:00.000Z	jgoguen	unagi_	You can have a script to restart X, simply have it give the command '/etc/init.d/gdm restart' and run it with sudo
2007-07-13T05:37:00.000Z	unagi_	jgoguen	the problem is that it doesnt actually
2007-07-13T05:38:00.000Z	jgoguen	unagi_	probably because the command is run within the context of Gnome, which is killed on restart, which means the restart command is killed by restarting
2007-07-13T05:38:00.000Z	jgoguen	unagi_	Ctrl+Alt+Backspace will do the trick
2007-07-13T05:38:00.000Z	jgoguen	unagi_	and is so much faster and better than a script
2007-07-13T05:38:00.000Z	jgoguen	unagi_	I just told you why
2007-07-13T05:39:00.000Z	jgoguen	unagi_	exactly
2007-07-13T05:39:00.000Z	jgoguen	unagi_	which is why it doesn't come up
2007-07-13T05:40:00.000Z	jgoguen	unagi_	console, not terminal
2007-07-13T05:40:00.000Z	jgoguen	unagi_	there's a difference
2007-07-13T05:40:00.000Z	jgoguen	unagi_	are you using Ubuntu?  I just tried it now on my laptop and from console, Gnome stopped and started again
2007-07-13T05:41:00.000Z	jgoguen	unagi_	but from terminal, it stopped and stayed there
2007-07-13T05:41:00.000Z	jgoguen	unagi_	remember, console is accessed with Ctrl+F1, Ctrl+F2, etc
2007-07-13T05:43:00.000Z	jgoguen	unagi_	no, not ?dm
2007-07-13T05:44:00.000Z	jgoguen	unagi_	ubotu says '?dm' since you could use gdm or kdm depending on what's there...in your case with Gnome, you would use '/etc/init.d/gdm restart' and NOT ?dm
2007-07-13T05:57:00.000Z	jgoguen	unagi_	at this point, you're probably best to reboot and start trying what you've been told after a reboot...everything you've been told about /etc/init.d/gdm is correct
