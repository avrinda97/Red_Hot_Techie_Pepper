2005-06-20T07:04:00.000Z	Echo_Mage		Anyone know the system requirements for Ubuntu?
2005-06-20T07:05:00.000Z	Echo_Mage		Nothing else matters then?
2005-06-20T07:05:00.000Z	Echo_Mage		Memory and processor speed are my main concern?
2005-06-20T07:06:00.000Z	Echo_Mage		got a P3 500 with 64MB RAM, think it will run ok?
2005-06-20T07:06:00.000Z	Echo_Mage		kewl
2005-06-20T07:06:00.000Z	Echo_Mage		thanks guys
2005-06-20T07:08:00.000Z	synd	Echo_Mage	gnome really needs about 256MB RAM minimum and a P3 proc to run decently
2005-06-20T07:11:00.000Z	synd	Echo_Mage	live cds are ok, but actual installations are better for seeing how well a distro performs
2005-06-20T07:29:00.000Z	synd	Echo_Mage	ubuntu is the best, imo
2005-06-20T07:49:00.000Z	synd	Echo_Mage	yo
2005-06-20T07:49:00.000Z	synd	Echo_Mage	oh really

2005-06-20T07:56:00.000Z	synd	Echo_Mage	winme.. id rather not use a computer than have to use that
2005-06-20T08:09:00.000Z	synd	Echo_Mage	yes

2005-06-20T08:10:00.000Z	synd	Echo_Mage	good deal
2005-06-20T08:12:00.000Z	Echo_Mage	synd	gonna get the OS on there and see how it runs, my big issue is how many different types of Install packages can it handle, also how does it hand USB and card readers
2005-06-20T08:12:00.000Z	synd	Echo_Mage	i use a san disk 8-1 card reader and it mounts automatically and runs fine
2005-06-20T08:13:00.000Z	synd	Echo_Mage	dunno. how is connected? usb?
2005-06-20T08:13:00.000Z	Echo_Mage	synd	Not sure its detected as SDA1 on my Mepis system
