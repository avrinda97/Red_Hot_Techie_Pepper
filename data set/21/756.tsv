2011-07-13T07:37:00.000Z	larie		hello
2011-07-13T07:37:00.000Z	larie		i need ERwin like app
2011-07-13T07:37:00.000Z	larie		i need to open *.erwin file
2011-07-13T07:37:00.000Z	larie		or er1 file
2011-07-13T07:37:00.000Z	magn3ts	larie	that doesn't seem very likely.
2011-07-13T07:38:00.000Z	larie	magn3ts	what likely? :)
2011-07-13T07:38:00.000Z	magn3ts	larie	I don't think you're going to find linux software that will read proprietary files.
2011-07-13T07:38:00.000Z	larie	magn3ts	i see
2011-07-13T07:38:00.000Z	magn3ts	larie	there are alternatives to erwin, but not nearly as professional, and like I said, they won't read erwin files.
2011-07-13T07:39:00.000Z	larie	magn3ts	$(file 1.erwin) shows me -> "data"
2011-07-13T07:39:00.000Z	magn3ts	larie	you are talking about the UML/diagramming software erwin right?
2011-07-13T07:39:00.000Z	magn3ts	larie	I'm just guessing, it may be reversable or human readable, but I doubt anyone's done it.
2011-07-13T07:39:00.000Z	larie	magn3ts	idk :) guy from my office wants to open ERwin file
2011-07-13T07:39:00.000Z	magn3ts	larie	when I see something like erwin's website... I immediately think VirtualBox+Windows until you can get away from that application, if that's even possible.
2011-07-13T07:40:00.000Z	larie	magn3ts	he can't open it on windows7 but he has ubuntu on laptop
2011-07-13T07:40:00.000Z	larie	magn3ts	what apps are similar to ERwin?
2011-07-13T07:40:00.000Z	magn3ts	larie	DBDesigner, uh, honestly I don't remember the others.
2011-07-13T07:41:00.000Z	larie	magn3ts	thx! is that app the best? :p
2011-07-13T07:41:00.000Z	magn3ts	larie	no clue, I ended up using paint as it was just a homework assignment.
2011-07-13T07:42:00.000Z	magn3ts	larie	honestly dbdesigner just happened to show up on a random search for "erwin files ubuntu".
2011-07-13T07:42:00.000Z	larie	magn3ts	hehe ;)
