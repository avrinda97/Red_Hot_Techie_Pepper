2010-08-08T17:11:00.000Z	KE1HA	juro	FireFox, yes, but not so much on Chrome.
2010-08-08T17:11:00.000Z	juro	KE1HA	Firefox is ok on my side (although not super great), Chrome just sux
2010-08-08T17:13:00.000Z	KE1HA	juro	Epiphany is all I'e been using lately, super-speedy.
2010-08-08T17:13:00.000Z	juro	KE1HA	does it have any addons?
2010-08-08T17:14:00.000Z	KE1HA	juro	few, not loads. I use firefox for any OpenPGP stuff, but mostly Epi.
2010-08-08T17:14:00.000Z	juro	KE1HA	I use Firefox with Firebug extensively

2010-08-08T17:16:00.000Z	KE1HA	juro	for the extensions, just do: sudo apt-get install epiphany-browser epiphany-extensions
2010-08-08T17:16:00.000Z	KE1HA	juro	or use the Package Manager.
2010-08-08T17:17:00.000Z	juro	KE1HA	ok, I'll have a look at that .. are there any Flash problems with Epiphany?
2010-08-08T17:18:00.000Z	KE1HA	juro	in the package manager, search Epiphany and it pulls all the add-on's and extension, you can read about each of them there before installing.
2010-08-08T17:19:00.000Z	KE1HA	juro	it has Media, P2P, flash and all that, but not all the fancy FF add-on's
2010-08-08T17:19:00.000Z	juro	KE1HA	ok, I'll check up on that
2010-08-08T17:22:00.000Z	juro	KE1HA	in the "Ubuntu Software Center" there are two Epophanys ... "Epiphany (epiphany-browser)" and "Epiphany Web Browser (Gecko)" - which one?
2010-08-08T17:24:00.000Z	KE1HA	juro	let me check-real quick to be sure I'll install on a VM
2010-08-08T17:25:00.000Z	juro	KE1HA	nah, too much work - I'll just apt-get install it
2010-08-08T17:25:00.000Z	KE1HA	juro	just doo: sudo apt-get install epiphany-browser epiphany-extensions
2010-08-08T17:26:00.000Z	juro	KE1HA	yeah busy downloading the packages
2010-08-08T17:27:00.000Z	KE1HA	juro	You'll like it, it's fast and light weight. Load real quick.
