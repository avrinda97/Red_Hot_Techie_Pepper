2005-08-12T16:46:00.000Z	Seveas		if you have no separate /boot partition, you can safely skip that step
2005-08-12T16:46:00.000Z	Seveas		then skip the step that tells you to mount /boot :)
2005-08-12T16:48:00.000Z	Seveas		be a bit more specific
2005-08-12T16:48:00.000Z	Seveas		there is no such thing as 'opening root'
2005-08-12T16:50:00.000Z	Seveas		you use sudo to get root privileges
2005-08-12T16:50:00.000Z	Seveas		sudo -i goves you a root shell
2005-08-12T16:51:00.000Z	Seveas		hmm, then your /etc/hosts is probably bad
2005-08-12T16:52:00.000Z	Seveas		can you paste that file on the pastebin please
2005-08-12T16:53:00.000Z	crank	Seveas	i can't, i have to swith between ubuntu and windows all the time to connect to the internet... (partitions ;))
2005-08-12T16:53:00.000Z	Seveas		there is an ext3 reader for windows :)
2005-08-12T16:54:00.000Z	crank		the file isn't changed, it's still the same from installing ubuntu
2005-08-12T16:55:00.000Z	Seveas		yeah, but i've seen it being mysteriously wrong for several people already
2005-08-12T16:55:00.000Z	crank		what should i kinda look like
2005-08-12T16:55:00.000Z	Seveas		there should be a line with 127.0.0.1 localhost localhost.localdomain your_hostname
2005-08-12T16:55:00.000Z	Seveas		where your_hostname is of course your actual hostname :)
2005-08-12T16:56:00.000Z	Seveas		if the your-hostname bit is missing, sudo will b0rk
2005-08-12T16:56:00.000Z	Seveas		and somehow it is missing sometimes
2005-08-12T16:56:00.000Z	crank		it isn't there as far as i remember
2005-08-12T16:56:00.000Z	crank		how can i edit the file?
2005-08-12T16:57:00.000Z	crank		or replace it...
2005-08-12T16:59:00.000Z	Seveas	crank	boot into recovey mode and edit it there
