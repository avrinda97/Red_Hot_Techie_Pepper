2005-05-26T16:33:00.000Z	Sionide		can anyone point me in the direction of how to set up a machine to dual-boot ?
2005-05-26T16:33:00.000Z	paulproteus	Sionide	To dual boot Windows and Ubuntu?
2005-05-26T16:33:00.000Z	Sionide		yeah, ubuntu being primary OS with a small (tiny!) windows 2k as well
2005-05-26T16:34:00.000Z	paulproteus	Sionide	If you just install Ubuntu after you have already installed Windows, then Ubuntu will handle dual boot for you.
2005-05-26T16:34:00.000Z	Sionide	paulproteus	ok is it that easy? i'll give it a shot tomorrow, install the windows one first you say, then ubuntu...
2005-05-26T16:34:00.000Z	paulproteus	Sionide	Yes.
2005-05-26T16:34:00.000Z	paulproteus	Sionide	Actually...
2005-05-26T16:35:00.000Z	Sionide		any links though?
2005-05-26T16:35:00.000Z	paulproteus	Sionide	With partitions it can be a little confusing.
2005-05-26T16:35:00.000Z	paulproteus	Sionide	Let me see, hold on a sec.
2005-05-26T16:35:00.000Z	Sionide		thanks
2005-05-26T16:36:00.000Z	paulproteus	Sionide	I don't seen anything on the wiki, so here is my advice.
2005-05-26T16:37:00.000Z	paulproteus	Sionide	Is this a blank hard drive?
2005-05-26T16:37:00.000Z	Sionide		yep
2005-05-26T16:37:00.000Z	Sionide		laptop is coming tomorrow, brand new, no OS pre-installed :)
2005-05-26T16:37:00.000Z	Sionide		http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/WindowsDualBootHowTo  <-- is a little confusing ... heh
2005-05-26T16:38:00.000Z	Sionide		gah i gotta shoot
2005-05-26T16:38:00.000Z	paulproteus	Sionide	That page is a total mess.
2005-05-26T16:38:00.000Z	Sionide		i'll give it a go tomorrow
2005-05-26T16:38:00.000Z	paulproteus	Sionide	Okay.  Just install Windows normally first, and then the Ubuntu Installer should help you shrink that partition as necessary to create room for Linux.
2005-05-26T16:38:00.000Z	paulproteus	Sionide	It should be that easy.
