2009-06-28T03:01:00.000Z	Royall_	kinja-sheep	last time I tried something without knowing what I was doing, I had to cut the power to the laptop
2009-06-28T03:01:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Royall_	You can try something -- and if you don't get any display, just wait 15 seconds and it'll resort back to the last choice.
2009-06-28T03:04:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Royall_	Did you try TwinView?
2009-06-28T03:07:00.000Z	Royall_	kinja-sheep	I don't "seem to have an nvidia X driver"
2009-06-28T03:08:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Royall_	Check and see if you already enable or if anything is in --> Admin --> Hardware Drivers?
2009-06-28T03:08:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Royall_	System --> Admin --> Hardware Drivers*
2009-06-28T03:08:00.000Z	Royall_	kinja-sheep	yep, they're all enables
2009-06-28T03:08:00.000Z	Royall_	kinja-sheep	and there's only the wireless card there, no graphics drivers
2009-06-28T03:09:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Royall_	Hmm. What choices do you have?
2009-06-28T03:09:00.000Z	Royall_	kinja-sheep	what choices? In hardware drivers? Just Broadcom wireless card
2009-06-28T03:09:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Royall_	I mean... in Display.
2009-06-28T03:10:00.000Z	Royall_	kinja-sheep	I have a Intel Corporation Mobile GM965/GL960 Integrated Graphics Controller, for future reference; In Display, I have my laptop monitor and my Sanyo TV
2009-06-28T03:11:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Royall_	ALT+F2 and run "nvidia-settings" -- Did anything show up?
2009-06-28T03:11:00.000Z	Royall_	kinja-sheep	"You do not appear to be using the NVIDIA X driver. Please edit your X configuration file (just run `nvidia-xconfig` as root), and restart the X server. "
2009-06-28T03:12:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Royall_	Is that settings window "NVIDIA X Server" something?
2009-06-28T03:12:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Royall_	Look under X Server Display Configuration and try enabling TwinView -- Also, what graphic card do you have?
2009-06-28T03:14:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Royall_	Did you find TwinView and try that?
2009-06-28T03:15:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Royall_	Ah I see.
2009-06-28T03:17:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Royall_	Work with what you have.  I have Nvidia Graphic Card so I don't know how you would deal with your situation.
