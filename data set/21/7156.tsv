2008-01-04T11:36:00.000Z	ljsmithx		I have a wallpaper but no icons... when I goto Places>Desktop nothing happens :(
2008-01-04T11:36:00.000Z	ljsmithx		I can't even right click
2008-01-04T11:38:00.000Z	ljsmithx		some ub3r 1337 h4x0r has stolen my icons lol
2008-01-04T11:38:00.000Z	Slart	ljsmithx	try restarting nautilus.. I think it handles the icons
2008-01-04T11:39:00.000Z	Slart	ljsmithx	can you start a terminal?
2008-01-04T11:40:00.000Z	Slart	ljsmithx	then run "nautilus" from the terminal
2008-01-04T11:41:00.000Z	Slart	ljsmithx	the sound of a satisfied, now with icons, ubuntu user? =)
2008-01-04T11:42:00.000Z	Slart	ljsmithx	you could try restarting gnome.. ctrl+alt+backspace ...it'll kill xchat though
2008-01-04T11:43:00.000Z	Slart	ljsmithx	ok.. try a reboot then.. might be something else that's borked
2008-01-04T11:48:00.000Z	Slart	ljsmithx	breathe..  calm... think of puppies and green grass in the summer..
2008-01-04T11:49:00.000Z	Slart	ljsmithx	can't have people climbing on the walls just because they got their icons back.. now can we? =)
2008-01-04T11:59:00.000Z	Slart	ljsmithx	because we already have irc?
2008-01-04T12:00:00.000Z	Slart	ljsmithx	they still have to learn the new instant messenger stuff.. now won't they?
2008-01-04T12:00:00.000Z	Slart	ljsmithx	irc is hard?
