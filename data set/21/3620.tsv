2008-11-09T19:14:00.000Z	jA_cOp		Ok, I am in the gparted resize screen, resizing an existing windows partition cannot remove any data, right?
2008-11-09T19:14:00.000Z	jA_cOp		I dont have the luxury of backing it up, jrib
2008-11-09T19:15:00.000Z	jA_cOp		I simply cleared 30gb of space
2008-11-09T19:16:00.000Z	jA_cOp		So what does the resizer actually do?
2008-11-09T19:16:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	jA_cOp	what do you mean what does it do?... it resizes the partitions on the drive.
2008-11-09T19:17:00.000Z	jA_cOp		Yes IndyGunFreak, but what happens to the data on the partition I resize?
2008-11-09T19:17:00.000Z	jA_cOp		It is an NTFS partition
2008-11-09T19:18:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		it will all be on the original partition, and the "new" partition will be blank.
2008-11-09T19:18:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	jA_cOp	*usually* it goes w/o a hitch, but if you have important data, its silly to do it w/o a backup
2008-11-09T19:18:00.000Z	jA_cOp		Well I moved all my important data to a flash drive, only lots of games left
2008-11-09T19:19:00.000Z	jA_cOp		So absolutely expendible
2008-11-09T19:19:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	jA_cOp	ok,... how big is your current drive?
2008-11-09T19:19:00.000Z	jA_cOp	IndyGunFreak	the drive in question is already parted in two NFTS partitions by windows, each being 89gb
2008-11-09T19:20:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	jA_cOp	ok.. and what are you wanting to do... shrink the second 89gig partition, for Linux?
2008-11-09T19:20:00.000Z	jA_cOp		Exactly IndyGunFreak, is this sensible?
2008-11-09T19:20:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	jA_cOp	thats what i would do...
2008-11-09T19:20:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	jA_cOp	i just can't stress to you enough, make sure anything i mportant is backed up
2008-11-09T19:21:00.000Z	jA_cOp	IndyGunFreak	The resizer is kind of confusing to me, how do I do it?
2008-11-09T19:21:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	jA_cOp	are you on the live CD now?
2008-11-09T19:21:00.000Z	jA_cOp		Yes IndyGunFreak, on the pidgin that comes with it
2008-11-09T19:22:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	jA_cOp	ok.. tyupe this w/o quotes.. "/join #indygunfreak"
