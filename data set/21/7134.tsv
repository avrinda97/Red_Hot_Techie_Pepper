2006-12-07T14:07:00.000Z	nothlit	gotit	people aren't always, and its always better to err on the said of caution
2006-12-09T11:35:00.000Z	nothlit	gotit	dhcp + router?
2006-12-09T11:35:00.000Z	nothlit	gotit	if you have a network setup + 8 comps then what are you really asking?
2006-12-09T11:36:00.000Z	nothlit	gotit	'give internet access to 4 or 8 computer on 4 diff networks'
2006-12-09T11:37:00.000Z	gotit	nothlit	yes but how i dont know
2006-12-09T11:37:00.000Z	gotit	nothlit	i just installed ubuntu
2006-12-13T13:52:00.000Z	nothlit	gotit	sudo aptitude install alien
2006-12-13T13:53:00.000Z	nothlit	gotit	alien is not something that is particularly safe to use so if there are other alternatives for you, you should take them
2006-12-13T13:54:00.000Z	gotit	nothlit	why alien is not safe, its on the web help to use it
2006-12-13T13:54:00.000Z	nothlit	gotit	because rpm packages are designed for a specific system and setup, which may not be the same as how ubuntu is set up
2006-12-13T13:56:00.000Z	gotit	nothlit	i am trying to install my intel graphic card , cause i think some screen savers are too heave for it
2006-12-13T13:57:00.000Z	nothlit	gotit	well you definitely do NOT want to install any drivers with alien
2006-12-13T13:57:00.000Z	gotit	nothlit	what should i do than
2006-12-13T13:58:00.000Z	nothlit	gotit	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Video?highlight=%28intel%29
2006-12-13T14:00:00.000Z	gotit	nothlit	i did that for the resolution, and it fixed my problem , but some screen savers are not running fine
