2005-09-06T08:28:00.000Z	Epix	cafuego	on boot
2005-09-06T08:28:00.000Z	Epix	cafuego	like, a gig
2005-09-06T08:31:00.000Z	Epix	cafuego	hmm, how hot should the heatsync be?
2005-09-06T08:32:00.000Z	cafuego	Epix	Depends. 140C for a P4, maybe 40C for an AMD64. Or anywhere in between.
2005-09-06T08:32:00.000Z	Epix	cafuego	would it burn me if i touched it? its an AMD athlon.
2005-09-06T08:32:00.000Z	cafuego	Epix	Seriously though, if it's over ~ 60C and it's not an original AthlonXp, you have a problem.
2005-09-06T08:33:00.000Z	cafuego	Epix	My AtlonXP 2400+ runs at in between 40 and 50C
2005-09-06T08:33:00.000Z	cafuego	Epix	the 1800+ models can run quite a bit hotter, afaik.
2005-09-06T08:33:00.000Z	Epix	cafuego	and how can i tell which ram socket is 1
2005-09-06T08:34:00.000Z	cafuego	Epix	It'll be printed on the mobo.
2005-09-06T08:38:00.000Z	Epix	cafuego	when i took out the card i just put in, it boots
2005-09-06T08:38:00.000Z	Epix	cafuego	the ram.
2005-09-06T08:39:00.000Z	Epix	cafuego	which i put in today... can you mix ram types? like SD and DDR
2005-11-22T07:00:00.000Z	cafuego	Epix	Best of a bad bunch
2005-11-22T07:00:00.000Z	Epix	cafuego	gaming, and running in general
2005-11-22T07:00:00.000Z	cafuego	Epix	Those are mutually exclusive.
2005-11-22T07:01:00.000Z	cafuego	Epix	better for gaming m,eans closed drivers, good running in general means open drivers.
