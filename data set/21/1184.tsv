2011-01-04T01:05:00.000Z	ad11		i cant upgrade this package
2011-01-04T01:05:00.000Z	maco	ad11	its a packaging bug
2011-01-04T01:05:00.000Z	maco	ad11	what version of ubuntu are you on?
2011-01-04T01:05:00.000Z	maco	ad11	oh 10.04 i guess from the package name
2011-01-04T01:06:00.000Z	maco	ad11	let me see if that bug's been reported
2011-01-04T01:11:00.000Z	maco	ad11	where did you get version 2.7.9?
2011-01-04T01:12:00.000Z	ad11	maco	: i just did un apt-get update and than upgrade
2011-01-04T01:12:00.000Z	ad11	maco	: my pidgin is 2.7.9
2011-01-04T01:12:00.000Z	maco	ad11	2.6.6 is the version in 10.04.... do you have a PPA or some other repo added for it?
2011-01-04T01:13:00.000Z	maco	ad11	2.7.9 is apparently uploaded but not yet on the servers for 11.04, but thats it...
2011-01-04T01:13:00.000Z	ad11	maco	probably its a pidgin dependecy problem
2011-01-04T01:14:00.000Z	maco	ad11	its not  dependency thing. it's someone packaged it wrong so the same file is in two packages. but i cant figure out who packaged it since that package doesnt look like it actually came from ubuntu
2011-01-04T01:15:00.000Z	ad11	maco	it probably didn't
2011-01-04T01:15:00.000Z	maco	ad11	then you need to talk to whomever packaged it. it's not an ubuntu bug.
2011-01-04T01:15:00.000Z	ad11	maco	so hot fix now the var/lock
2011-01-04T01:17:00.000Z	ad11	maco	i have this update manager attention icon i have on the sys try
2011-01-04T01:17:00.000Z	maco	ad11	for now, i'd say lock the version on those packages in synaptic or remove pidgin-facebookchat until its fixed
2011-01-04T01:17:00.000Z	ad11	maco	: ok thanks :)
2011-01-04T01:18:00.000Z	maco	ad11	look in /etc/apt/sources.list and /etc/apt/sources.list.d/* to try to figure out where the package is coming from and notify them of teh bug
2011-01-04T01:18:00.000Z	ad11	maco	ok i will.
