2008-01-01T17:23:00.000Z	hwilde	fivetwentysix	if you kill all the programs does the mouse stutter
2008-01-01T17:23:00.000Z	fivetwentysix	hwilde	no if i just turn off my torrent client it doesn't stutter!
2008-01-01T17:24:00.000Z	hwilde	fivetwentysix	you are overloading yoru system with disk i/o and network traffic and cpu utilization and that is slowing your refresh rate
2008-01-01T17:25:00.000Z	fivetwentysix	hwilde	Thank you, you seem to understand my problem!
2008-01-01T17:25:00.000Z	fivetwentysix	hwilde	However it's not my refresh rate, I can alt tab very smoothly while my mouse is stuttering.
2008-01-01T17:25:00.000Z	hwilde	fivetwentysix	can you reproduce the same behavior with other network, disk io, cpu,  or is it just bittorrent
2008-01-01T17:26:00.000Z	fivetwentysix	hwilde	Yes, when I use mediatomb to stream to my PS3 it completely locks up my mouse far worse than bittorrent.
2008-01-01T17:26:00.000Z	hwilde	fivetwentysix	ok then you have IRQ issues
2008-01-01T17:26:00.000Z	fivetwentysix	hwilde	Let me google that.
2008-01-01T17:27:00.000Z	hwilde	fivetwentysix	 try adding   pci=routeirq    or pci=pollirq   to your grub boot
2008-01-01T17:27:00.000Z	hwilde	fivetwentysix	it is probably your network card and the usb hub having conflicts
2008-01-01T17:28:00.000Z	fivetwentysix	hwilde	Yes I find that sometimes my network card has issues as well.
2008-01-01T17:32:00.000Z	fivetwentysix	hwilde	kernel  /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.22-14-generic root=UUID=f11a0cc4-1dac-47c9-812b-153ce86fc9ff ro quiet splash pci=routeirq
2008-01-01T17:32:00.000Z	fivetwentysix	hwilde	Is that right?
2008-01-01T17:32:00.000Z	hwilde	fivetwentysix	yeah or   pci=pollirq
2008-01-01T17:39:00.000Z	hwilde	fivetwentysix	you have IRQ conflicts buddy.    "Check and see if you have an IRQ conflict"    http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-hardware-18/usb-mouse-causes-system-freeze-71541/
2008-01-01T17:39:00.000Z	fivetwentysix	hwilde	Is Ubuntu a plug and play operating system?
2008-01-01T17:39:00.000Z	hwilde	fivetwentysix	 "Feisty: usb mouse stops working"  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.22/+bug/84762
2008-01-01T17:39:00.000Z	fivetwentysix	hwilde	your solution worked by the way
2008-01-01T17:40:00.000Z	fivetwentysix	hwilde	I'm using bittorrent and streaming a movie to my ps3 with out any mouse lock ups! I'm so happy!
2008-01-01T17:40:00.000Z	fivetwentysix	hwilde	In fact my mouse is even smoother!
