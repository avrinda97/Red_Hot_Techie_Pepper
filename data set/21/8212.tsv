2006-11-03T14:59:00.000Z	glatzor	Tonren	update-manager does a lot of checks to ensure that the upgrade will work
2006-11-03T15:00:00.000Z	glatzor	Tonren	The AIglx extension is on by default but there is no app that makes use of it :)
2006-11-03T15:00:00.000Z	Tonren	glatzor	Cool.
2006-11-03T15:00:00.000Z	glatzor	Tonren	so don't worry :)
2006-11-03T15:01:00.000Z	glatzor	Tonren	If you don't have any problems using dapper or don't need the latest version of your apps, you could also stay with dapper :)
2006-11-03T15:01:00.000Z	Tonren	glatzor	Nah, I may as well stay up to date.
2006-11-03T15:01:00.000Z	glatzor	Tonren	you can read the release notes in update-manager :)
2006-11-03T15:03:00.000Z	glatzor	Tonren	yes. and it consumes less memory
2006-11-03T15:08:00.000Z	Tonren	glatzor	It says it's going to remove a whole bunch of xserver packages.  Is that bad?
2006-11-03T15:09:00.000Z	Tonren	glatzor	Ah, ok.  Also, it says I'm making a download of about 1 gigabyte.  Do I get any of that space back once it's done?
2006-11-03T15:10:00.000Z	glatzor	Tonren	please give me feedback how the upgrade ended
2006-11-03T15:29:00.000Z	glatzor	Tonren	don't do this during the installation. During downloading should be ok
2006-11-03T15:10:00.000Z	Tonren	glatzor	Well, it'll probably take 3 or 4 hours.
2006-11-03T15:10:00.000Z	glatzor	Tonren	the package chache will be reduced to 500 mb every  day by a cron job
2006-11-03T15:10:00.000Z	Tonren	glatzor	Whew.
2006-11-03T15:11:00.000Z	glatzor	Tonren	you can run "sudo apt-get clean" to remove all packages from the cache
2006-11-03T15:28:00.000Z	glatzor	Tonren	you cannot close it :)
2006-11-03T15:30:00.000Z	glatzor	Tonren	but keep in mind, that your sources list has already been modified
2006-11-03T15:30:00.000Z	Tonren	glatzor	variant: OK.  RIght now it still says "Fetching file x of 1450 at really-god-damn-slow k/s", so I can safely Ctrl + C out of it, shut down, restart, run gksu "update-manager -c"?
2006-11-03T15:30:00.000Z	Tonren	glatzor	Yeah, I'm definitely not gonna go off and download/install new software now!
