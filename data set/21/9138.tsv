2006-01-18T08:00:00.000Z	Mabus07		I have no video in my ctrl-alt-f7 window. I freshly installed ubuntu and I use an ATI Radeon X700 Pro.
2006-01-18T08:01:00.000Z	Mabus07		can someone please help me? I really can't do anything other than wait in here for an answer without gnome
2006-01-18T08:01:00.000Z	soundray	Mabus07	did you install restricted modules and the fglrx stuff?
2006-01-18T08:01:00.000Z	Mabus07	soundray	no
2006-01-18T08:01:00.000Z	Mabus07	soundray	this is a brand spanking fresh install of ubuntu, yet for some reason apt-get is not working properly, I believe it has something to do with the canadian archives being down as someone mentioned before.
2006-01-18T08:02:00.000Z	Mabus07	soundray	yes, I own an ati card, I'm familiar with that page. However with no gnome I can't go to the ATI site, and with no apt-get I can't install fglrx
2006-01-18T08:03:00.000Z	soundray	Mabus07	if it's just the Canadian archives, replace all occurrences of ca. in /etc/apt/sources.list with us. or uk.
2006-01-18T08:03:00.000Z	Mabus07	soundray	okay thanks
2006-01-18T08:04:00.000Z	soundray	Mabus07	you know the drill from thereon?
2006-01-18T08:20:00.000Z	soundray	Mabus07	any helpful messages in /var/log/Xorg.0.log ?
2006-03-02T15:15:00.000Z	soundray	Mabus07	yes, that is what the option is called.
2006-03-02T15:17:00.000Z	soundray	Mabus07	nickrud, I have used --print-uris and wget to update offline machines.
2006-03-02T15:17:00.000Z	Mabus07	soundray	great, so can you give me a few pointers?
2006-03-02T15:17:00.000Z	soundray	Mabus07	read man apt-get
2006-03-02T15:21:00.000Z	soundray	Mabus07	perhaps you just need to run 'apt-cache depends packagename' and copy from /var/cache/apt/archive the appropriate packages.
2006-03-02T15:22:00.000Z	soundray	Mabus07	sorry, got to go, hope you find a solution.
