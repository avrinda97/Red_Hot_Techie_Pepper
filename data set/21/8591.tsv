2006-03-14T06:54:00.000Z	eth0	mandavi	do u have 11 repos, or more than that?
2006-03-14T06:56:00.000Z	mandavi	eth0	if your sources.list is ok - check that again - than you should not have problems with apt-get update
2006-03-14T06:56:00.000Z	mandavi	eth0	i used automatix and it added plenty os repos...
2006-03-14T06:56:00.000Z	eth0	mandavi	apt-get update seemed to work
2006-03-14T06:56:00.000Z	mandavi	eth0	did you do that? - using automatix?
2006-03-14T06:57:00.000Z	eth0	mandavi	i have 9 repos in my sources.list
2006-03-14T06:57:00.000Z	eth0		er sorry
2006-03-14T06:58:00.000Z	eth0	mandavi	11 not 9
2006-03-14T06:58:00.000Z	eth0	mandavi	so i guess all is ok
2006-03-14T06:59:00.000Z	mandavi	eth0	it is probably anyway anough - but if you want to be sure to have always the latest stuff - get automatix and run it
2006-03-14T06:59:00.000Z	eth0	mandavi	ok, thanks
2006-03-14T07:00:00.000Z	eth0	mandavi	cant find any package called automatix
