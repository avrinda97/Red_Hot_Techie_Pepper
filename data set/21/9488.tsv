2007-02-19T16:18:00.000Z	aflack		Question.
2007-02-19T16:19:00.000Z	aflack		I'm getting this error: configure: error: *** GLIB >= 1.2.2 not installed - please install first *** when trying to install xmms.
2007-02-19T16:19:00.000Z	aflack		Any idea how to fix it?
2007-02-19T16:20:00.000Z	aflack		It's in the repository?..
2007-02-19T16:20:00.000Z	aflack		For 5.10?
2007-02-19T16:20:00.000Z	aflack		Breezy?
2007-02-19T16:20:00.000Z	aflack		I tried searching for it in the pkg list..
2007-02-19T16:20:00.000Z	aflack		Then downloaded the .gz file, and tried to ./configure
2007-02-19T16:21:00.000Z	Flannel	aflack	why not just install xmms from the repos?
2007-02-19T16:21:00.000Z	Flannel	aflack	apt-get install xmms?
2007-02-19T16:22:00.000Z	Flannel	aflack	pastebin your sources.list, you must have something odd going on
2007-02-19T16:24:00.000Z	Flannel	aflack	pastebin your sources.list
2007-02-19T16:30:00.000Z	Flannel	aflack	er, this is a fresh install?
2007-02-19T16:30:00.000Z	Flannel	aflack	grab something newer (dapper), Breezy goes out of support in april
2007-02-19T16:30:00.000Z	Flannel	aflack	Dapper is just like breezy, only with newer stuff
2007-02-19T16:31:00.000Z	Flannel	aflack	yeah, just newer versions, and Edgy, and Feisty (will be)
2007-02-19T16:31:00.000Z	Flannel	aflack	Theyre all 'the same', just different ages
2007-02-19T16:31:00.000Z	Flannel	aflack	Dapper is a LTS, which is a bit important
2007-02-19T16:32:00.000Z	Flannel	aflack	Edgy is 6.10, dapper is 6.06, Dapper is more mature, having been out four months longer, and will be supported longer too, being a LTS
2007-02-19T16:36:00.000Z	Flannel	aflack	I recently upgraded from breezy too, because I had a week of downtime, and my last downtime before april
2008-10-24T09:36:00.000Z	Flannel	aflack	A good place for that would be #ubuntu-offtopic
