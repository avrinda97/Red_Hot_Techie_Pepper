2008-05-02T08:55:00.000Z	acidicbase		is there a fix for ati and ubuntu 8.0.4?
2008-05-02T08:55:00.000Z	drivetrax	acidicbase	 what ati card?
2008-05-02T08:55:00.000Z	acidicbase		x800xl
2008-05-02T08:55:00.000Z	acidicbase		gnome is slow as hell
2008-05-02T08:55:00.000Z	acidicbase		was fine in 7.10
2008-05-02T08:56:00.000Z	acidicbase		no it is slow
2008-05-02T08:56:00.000Z	acidicbase		i can see it draw the windows
2008-05-02T08:56:00.000Z	drivetrax	acidicbase	 the driver 8.4 from the ATI site, must be direct rendering on
2008-05-02T08:56:00.000Z	acidicbase		ok
2008-05-02T08:56:00.000Z	drivetrax	acidicbase	- does yours has catalyst
2008-05-02T08:57:00.000Z	acidicbase		no, I'm just using what came with 8.0.4
2008-05-02T08:57:00.000Z	drivetrax		uhm
2008-05-02T08:57:00.000Z	drivetrax	acidicbase	 either use the restricted drivers.. or get and install from ATI/AMD
2008-05-02T08:58:00.000Z	acidicbase		yea i have restricted drivers, it says in use
2008-05-02T08:58:00.000Z	drivetrax	acidicbase	 If those do not work, the work around is to remove them.. and use the Ubuntu 7.10 generic
2008-05-02T08:59:00.000Z	drivetrax	acidicbase	 are you familiar with xorg.conf?
2008-05-02T08:59:00.000Z	acidicbase	drivetrax	I will try to download the one from ati's site, what do you mean direct rendering?
2008-05-02T08:59:00.000Z	acidicbase	drivetrax	yea
2008-05-02T09:00:00.000Z	drivetrax	acidicbase	 there is a caommand to see if the vid card is using tha rendering, but first try the install of that Huge linux driver from ati.. and see if it works for your card.  For my 9600 AIW, it was no good.
2008-05-02T09:00:00.000Z	acidicbase	drivetrax	will do
2008-05-02T09:01:00.000Z	drivetrax	acidicbase	 if the driver does not work remove it, disable restricted drivers, and that would mean removing fglrx
