2006-06-22T15:29:00.000Z	Spy		yeah, i bought a psu and now it has 24 pins, my motherboard only has 20
2006-06-22T15:29:00.000Z	maccam94	Spy	you need to use an adapter
2006-06-22T15:29:00.000Z	maccam94		the new PCIe mobos use 24 pin power connectors, Spy
2006-06-22T15:29:00.000Z	Spy		not according to this freak http://compreviews.about.com/od/cases/a/ATX12VvATX.htm
2006-06-22T15:29:00.000Z	maccam94	Spy	but there are usually adapters included with the PSUs
2006-06-22T15:30:00.000Z	maccam94	Spy	? if your mobo has room, you can just plug the cable in directly, but if there isn't clearance use an adapter
2006-06-22T15:31:00.000Z	Spy		it has room but i don't wanna blow up my motherboard?
2006-06-22T15:31:00.000Z	maccam94	Spy	it won't

2006-06-22T15:32:00.000Z	Spy	maccam94	would you believe that i already started making documents on how i planned to move the cables around as to make it the same as the older 20pin connector
2006-06-22T15:32:00.000Z	Spy		Mattsta: what seemto be the problem?
2006-06-22T15:34:00.000Z	Spy		have you tried though, find an exe and double click it
2006-06-22T15:34:00.000Z	Spy		or use the console
2006-06-22T15:34:00.000Z	Spy		mattsta: wine program.exe
2006-06-22T15:38:00.000Z	Spy	maccam94	- it works..
