2009-05-13T08:33:00.000Z	h00k	RichiV	all of the questions you've asked me I've covered in the original question
2009-05-13T08:34:00.000Z	h00k	RichiV	9.04, BCM 4328
2009-05-13T08:34:00.000Z	RichiV	h00k	sorry ive only just got on, so i didn't know that oricinal Question... I also had the same problem, and for me I am using a laptop, so I Plugged my laptop in while updating and such... amybe its the power... It worked for me.
2009-05-13T08:35:00.000Z	h00k	RichiV	yeah, its alright, I'm going to try something else again
2009-05-13T08:36:00.000Z	RichiV	h00k	oh also the new Jaunty has nummerous bugs, and downgrading to the 8.04 Hardy LTS then upgrading to 8.10 Intrepid might be of help as well
2009-05-13T08:36:00.000Z	RichiV	h00k	8.10 got all of my drivers to work, ecspecially my GFX driver the ATI mobi radeon x600, which is not supported in Jaunty or Hardy
2009-05-13T08:37:00.000Z	h00k	RichiV	8.10 might be an option for him if that will work better
