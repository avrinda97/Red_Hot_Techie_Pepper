2009-04-24T15:40:00.000Z	drew2world		can anyone direct me to the right channel for assistance in setting up an ubuntu network?
2009-04-24T15:41:00.000Z	drew2world		can ubuntu support networking without a server?
2009-04-24T15:42:00.000Z	drew2world		well, I know with Windows and Mac you can easily set up a network without the use of a server
2009-04-24T15:42:00.000Z	drew2world		peer to peer
2009-04-24T15:43:00.000Z	drew2world		setting us two desktops and having them communicate
2009-04-24T15:44:00.000Z	drew2world		no...just to share info...files and such...although I would like to use the remote desktop app that came with the os
2009-04-24T15:45:00.000Z	drew2world		ah...my bad
2009-04-24T15:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drew2world	if you want to make it secure use vnc over ssh
2009-04-24T15:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drew2world	here, but can you be more specific
2009-04-24T15:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drew2world	how do you mean "support networking"
2009-04-24T15:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drew2world	it can access TCP based networks and access routers without need for a server
2009-04-24T15:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drew2world	what are you trying to achieve
2009-04-24T15:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drew2world	do you mean file sharing between 2 systems?
2009-04-24T15:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drew2world	if you have a router / switch and 2 PCs, you have a network
2009-04-24T15:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drew2world	ok we're getting a little closer now. Why are they communicating? What service is one offering to the other?
2009-04-24T15:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drew2world	you can use ssh, file sharing, email access, printer sharing
2009-04-24T15:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drew2world	you need to be specific
2009-04-24T15:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drew2world	ok then you should have said that instead of "set up a network"
2009-04-24T15:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drew2world	if you install and configure samba you can fileshare between any OS
2009-04-24T15:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drew2world	if you want a remote connnection to view the whole desktop you can use VNC
2009-04-24T15:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drew2world	if you want to run the apps on the system and have the display forwarded to the remote system you can use x forwarding
