2010-04-21T03:09:00.000Z	yaaar		hi guys. i installed 9.10 on a friend's laptop (HP pavillion dv6000) but it won't boot. I get the grub prompt, but all options (once I take out 'quiet' from the kernel line) result in "error: couldn't open file" ...I googled a bit and found some people (none with an identical error) suggesting adding "noapic nolapic" to the options, but that didn't change anything. Any ideas on what I should do?
2010-04-21T03:10:00.000Z	MK13	yaaar	what kinda of install (full or wubi)?
2010-04-21T03:10:00.000Z	yaaar	MK13	full
2010-04-21T03:13:00.000Z	MK13	yaaar	wiki.ubuntu.com/Grub2 , tells how to recover grub2 from live cd
2010-04-21T03:17:00.000Z	yaaar	MK13	ok, thanks i'll give that a shot
2010-04-21T04:21:00.000Z	yaaar	MK13	well, i recovered grub as described in that link, but it still tells me "error: couldn't read file" when i try to boot
2010-04-21T04:23:00.000Z	MK13	yaaar	then I don't know what to tell you to do w/ out knowing more about your setup
2010-04-21T04:25:00.000Z	yaaar	MK13	hmm. what would you like to know? i'd be happy to provide whatever information i can. i'm just doing a completely stock install (using the whole drive) of 9.10 (32b) and the hardware is an HP pavilion dv6000
2010-04-21T04:26:00.000Z	MK13	yaaar	what filesystem did you use?
2010-04-21T04:27:00.000Z	yaaar	MK13	i didn't specify any custom options at all. i just chose 'use entire disk' ...iirc it defaults to ext4?
2010-04-21T04:31:00.000Z	MK13	yaaar	yea ext4 is the default... as far as the error messages it seems it happens usually when updating from grub to grub2
2010-04-21T04:32:00.000Z	MK13	yaaar	so if you installed it on the whole drive what does the grub2 boot entry look like>
2010-04-21T04:37:00.000Z	yaaar	MK13	well, it's in another room so it'll be tricky to get verbatim, but here's the basic rundown. it sets the error variable, then checks for the grub environment, then 'set quiet=1' then 'insmod ext2' then 'root (hd0,1)' then a line searching for a filesystem id, and then finally the big kernel line, which has root=/dev/sda1 and only 3 options: ro quiet splash
2010-04-21T04:38:00.000Z	yaaar	MK13	i've also tried with 'noapic nolapic' with the same results. i can give you more detail on any of those lines if you need it. you think maybe 'insmod ext2' is the issue? or is ext4 still back-compat with 2 just like 3 was?
2010-04-21T04:39:00.000Z	MK13	yaaar	i would prolly chance the insmod to ext4 just to check
2010-04-21T04:39:00.000Z	yaaar	MK13	roger that
2010-04-21T04:40:00.000Z	yaaar	MK13	that changes it from "error: Couldn't read file" to "error: File not found"
2010-04-21T04:40:00.000Z	MK13	yaaar	though it should be backwards compatable... what that error says to me is either wrong filesystem type given or wron partition given
2010-04-21T04:43:00.000Z	MK13	yaaar	i wish i could look at my grub.cfg and help you out but that is the best i can do... and i g2g for now so hope someone else can help you
2010-04-21T04:44:00.000Z	yaaar	MK13	ok, well thanks for giving it a shot. cheers
2010-04-21T04:49:00.000Z	MK13	yaaar	real quick check the entries given here and see if anything is missing/wrong https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Grub2
