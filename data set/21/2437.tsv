2010-05-21T02:47:00.000Z	ikonia	BluShift	some people like it, can be good for things like raid devices
2010-05-21T02:47:00.000Z	BluShift	ikonia	Fair enough.
2010-05-21T02:50:00.000Z	ikonia	BluShift	you don't, you just configure them either in the desktop or the config file
2010-05-21T02:51:00.000Z	BluShift	ikonia	So, how would I go about re-detecting an NIC that used to work, but is no longer being detected by the system? I installed ndiswrapper, tried some drivers for another NIC, (taking the name wlan0 in the process) and now that I've uninstalled ndiswrapper (and the driver with it) and put the previous card in (which worked out of the box) it no longer is being detected.
2010-05-21T02:52:00.000Z	ikonia	BluShift	you need to figure out why the card no longer works, the reason it can't see it is technical, so a redect would just miss it again
2010-05-21T02:54:00.000Z	BluShift	ikonia	Hmm. Ok.
2010-05-21T02:55:00.000Z	ikonia	BluShift	can you remember anything that changed between it working a not (kernel update is most common)
2010-05-21T02:55:00.000Z	ikonia	BluShift	does lspci show the card ?
2010-05-21T02:55:00.000Z	ikonia	BluShift	does the syslog show it being found but ignored at boot time
2010-05-21T02:56:00.000Z	BluShift	ikonia	Not in a form i recognize. It lists a "Texas Instruments" device, but that's all.
2010-05-21T02:56:00.000Z	ikonia	BluShift	all things to investigate
2010-05-21T02:56:00.000Z	BluShift	ikonia	I will do so.
2010-05-21T02:56:00.000Z	ikonia	BluShift	then it looks like there maybe a hadware problem with that card, as lspci doesn't care if it's usable or not, it just (should) see it as a dumb deice
2010-05-21T02:56:00.000Z	ikonia	BluShift	is this a laptop ?
2010-05-21T02:56:00.000Z	BluShift	ikonia	No, it's a desktop.
2010-05-21T02:57:00.000Z	ikonia	BluShift	sounds like the card is dead
2010-05-21T02:57:00.000Z	BluShift	ikonia	It works fine in my brothers machine, though :/
2010-05-21T02:57:00.000Z	ikonia	BluShift	sounds like the socket/bus is dead
2010-05-21T02:57:00.000Z	ikonia	BluShift	or got damaged in transit
2010-05-21T02:57:00.000Z	BluShift	ikonia	Huh.
