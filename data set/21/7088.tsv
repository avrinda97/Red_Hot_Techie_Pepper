2006-11-30T08:42:00.000Z	Znortfl		kicker, I am losing the plot here. The problem is, I do not receive any upgrades since upgrading to Edgy
2006-11-30T08:42:00.000Z	sod75_	Znortfl	but you still get the icon that there are updates available ?
2006-11-30T08:42:00.000Z	Znortfl	sod75_	negative
2006-11-30T08:43:00.000Z	sod75_	Znortfl	is it running
2006-11-30T08:43:00.000Z	Znortfl	sod75_	as in a background process?
2006-11-30T08:44:00.000Z	Znortfl	sod75_	there is a program called "update-notifier" active, that's the one right?
2006-11-30T08:44:00.000Z	sod75_	Znortfl	 yes, adept_notifier
2006-11-30T08:44:00.000Z	Znortfl	sod75_	no haven't got that one
2006-11-30T08:45:00.000Z	sod75_	Znortfl	maybe that's because I'm on Kubuntu, tried "sudo apt-get update " ?
2006-11-30T08:46:00.000Z	Znortfl	sod75_	yes I did.. it hits a lot of lists but it doesn't install anything
2006-11-30T08:47:00.000Z	sod75_	Znortfl	it is not supposed to install anything, but it should make the notifier aware of new updates....
2006-11-30T08:48:00.000Z	Znortfl	sod75_	and then I run update-manager?
2006-11-30T08:48:00.000Z	sod75_	Znortfl	well, I use adept-notifier, which I just click
2006-11-30T08:49:00.000Z	Znortfl	sod75_	well only two packages are shown. And those are grey
2006-11-30T08:50:00.000Z	sod75_	Znortfl	sorry , you've lost me
2006-11-30T08:50:00.000Z	Znortfl	sod75_	the update-manager (or adept-manager for that matter) shows only two packages that are available for updating. And I can't click to install those, because they are greyed out
2006-11-30T08:52:00.000Z	sod75_	Znortfl	isn't there an "apply updates" button  ?
2006-11-30T08:53:00.000Z	sod75_	Znortfl	did you run it as root ( with kdesu, or gnome equivalent ) ?
2006-11-30T08:53:00.000Z	Znortfl	sod75_	affirmative
2006-11-30T08:54:00.000Z	sod75_	Znortfl	then I don't have a clue why it's greeyed out :/
2006-11-30T08:54:00.000Z	Znortfl	sod75_	ok thanks anyway
