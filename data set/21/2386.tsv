2009-12-13T05:12:00.000Z	meowbuntu	IdleOne	am just getting ideas if anyone here has maby tryed it as well. i  know about googoe thanks
2009-12-13T05:13:00.000Z	IdleOne	meowbuntu	did I tell you to google? I know about the factoid. YOU are asking about win4lin in an Ubuntu channel. I suggested wubi because if any issues arise you can ask in here about wubi.
2009-12-13T05:15:00.000Z	meowbuntu	IdleOne	but wubi is lin4win about running linux on a windows machine. i am wanting to run windows on a linux machine. thats still relevent to discuss here. for basic info

2009-12-13T05:18:00.000Z	meowbuntu	IdleOne	not enough ram to run vbox
2010-01-26T12:58:00.000Z	meowbuntu	IdleOne	you should know instead of using apt-get. its better to use  aptitude http://tombuntu.com/index.php/2007/08/12/dont-apt-get-aptitude/
2010-01-26T13:13:00.000Z	IdleOne	meowbuntu	flooding the channel with inxi is a good way to get the ops bothered and eject you
2010-01-26T13:14:00.000Z	IdleOne	meowbuntu	no it is not. flooding is flooding. please use a pastebin
