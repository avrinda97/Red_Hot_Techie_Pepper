2010-07-08T08:12:00.000Z	fxfitz		Can someone tell me how to give eth0 a static ip address in ubuntu? :(
2010-07-08T08:13:00.000Z	aristo	fxfitz	r u using gnome?
2010-07-08T08:14:00.000Z	fxfitz	aristo	I would like to do it via command line.
2010-07-08T08:15:00.000Z	fxfitz	aristo	But will I have to run the command multiple times?
2010-07-08T08:18:00.000Z	fxfitz	aristo	Would it be the broadcast option?
2010-07-08T08:19:00.000Z	aristo	fxfitz	if u only need to set static ip, you don't need to set up broadcast
2010-07-08T08:21:00.000Z	fxfitz	aristo	Hmm... any idea what would be wrong with 'ifconfig eth0 address 192.168.1.2' ?? Netmask should be the same.
2010-07-08T08:22:00.000Z	fxfitz	aristo	Hehe what if I'm SSHing in and hoping it works the first time? ;-)
2010-07-08T08:30:00.000Z	aristo	fxfitz	did you set default gateway?
2010-07-08T08:31:00.000Z	fxfitz	aristo	No?
2010-07-08T08:31:00.000Z	fxfitz	aristo	How so?
2010-07-08T08:32:00.000Z	fxfitz	aristo	You know, I did this once a few months ago with a server edition and I don't remember it being this complicated. :-P
2010-07-08T08:36:00.000Z	fxfitz	aristo	Got it.
2010-07-08T08:55:00.000Z	fxfitz	aristo	Sooo it didn't work.
2010-07-08T08:55:00.000Z	fxfitz	aristo	Did you say I needed to edit the resolv.conf file?
2010-07-08T08:56:00.000Z	aristo	fxfitz	yes you need to add nameserver XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
2010-07-08T08:56:00.000Z	fxfitz	aristo	But my ISP's DNS servers are already in there. :(
2010-07-08T08:59:00.000Z	fxfitz	aristo	Hang on, I'm actually on irssi from the server I'm trying to change. :-P

2010-07-08T09:10:00.000Z	fxfitz	aristo	Does that look like what you're talking about? The first paragraph sounds a bit like what you were saying.
2010-07-08T09:12:00.000Z	aristo	fxfitz	yes that's it
