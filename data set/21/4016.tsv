2008-07-30T22:30:00.000Z	s33nagain		 I need  to know how to properly use make... I tried looking at "man make" but it didn't help... Can anyone help me? I tried ndiswrapper in the past (Now I don't need it) but right now I need to Make Apache 2.2.9
2008-07-30T22:31:00.000Z	s33nagain		I need help using "make" in the terminal for Apache
2008-07-30T22:31:00.000Z	TiredWolf	s33nagain	apache 2.2.8 is in the repositories, which is a much better and safer option. do you REALLY need 2.2.9?
2008-07-30T22:33:00.000Z	TiredWolf	s33nagain	in Ubuntu, you generally should NOT "download" things. things are found in the repositories, and are compiled and optimized for Ubuntu, and receive regular security updates.
2008-07-30T22:33:00.000Z	TiredWolf	s33nagain	type "sudo apt-get install apache2" to get Apache 2.2.8 installed and running automatically.
2008-07-30T22:37:00.000Z	TiredWolf	s33nagain	as a side note, typing the first few letters of my tickname (which is TiredWolf, not TriedWolf) and then hitting TAB will get it auto-completed for you, which is handy.
2008-07-30T22:37:00.000Z	TiredWolf	s33nagain	the command is "sudo apt-get install apache2". you might want to stay on the channel, this time, for any further assistance
2008-07-30T22:37:00.000Z	s33nagain	TiredWolf	ahhh, I see.
2008-07-30T22:38:00.000Z	s33nagain	TiredWolf	Thanks, and I will stay on!
2008-07-30T22:39:00.000Z	TiredWolf	s33nagain	you can also install it using the "Synaptic" application in your menu (not Add/Remove Programs, though, as that will only offer a selection of graphical applications), if you're not a fan of the command line.
2008-07-30T22:41:00.000Z	s33nagain	TiredWolf	I don't mind the command line... I never thought of Synaptic... The only reson I actually downloaded it in the first place was because I couldn't find it in Add/Remove... Next time I have a program not graphical, I'll try it! But Apache already finished installing!

2008-07-30T22:43:00.000Z	TiredWolf	s33nagain	good, it should already be running then. point your browser to "http://localhost" and see.
2008-07-30T22:43:00.000Z	s33nagain	TiredWolf	Is Apache already running?
2008-07-30T22:44:00.000Z	TiredWolf	s33nagain	it should be
2008-07-30T22:44:00.000Z	s33nagain	TiredWolf	Where is it installed, and where are my htdocs?
2008-07-30T22:56:00.000Z	TiredWolf	s33nagain	uh?
2008-07-30T22:57:00.000Z	TiredWolf	s33nagain	i don't see anybody saying that. although it's usually assumed, since it's the current version
2008-07-30T22:58:00.000Z	TiredWolf	s33nagain	ubottu didn't say anything about your version, it's simply set for Hardy by default. besides, Hardy is 8.04, not 7.10
2008-07-30T22:59:00.000Z	TiredWolf	s33nagain	anyway, lsb_release -a will tell you both name and number
2008-07-30T23:12:00.000Z	TiredWolf	s33nagain	i suggest typing "apt-cache search mysql front". the answer is yes anyway
