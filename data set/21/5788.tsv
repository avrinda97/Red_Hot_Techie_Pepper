2007-08-08T15:29:00.000Z	LLzzJJ	remote_	what type of adaptor is it?
2007-08-08T15:29:00.000Z	remote_	LLzzJJ	its an 802.11g dynamode
2007-08-08T15:30:00.000Z	remote_		WL-GI-600s to be exact
2007-08-08T15:30:00.000Z	remote_		ACTUALLY its - WL-GI-700s
2007-08-08T15:30:00.000Z	LLzzJJ	remote_	check the wiki and help docs: https://wiki.ubuntu.com, you may have to use the ndiswrapper and the windows driver to make it work,
2007-08-08T15:31:00.000Z	remote_		k, thanks
2007-08-08T15:32:00.000Z	LLzzJJ	remote_	you could also try to open a console and type 'lsusb' this will list some usb info, your device will have an 8 digit number in the form of 'nnnn nnnn' try google this number and it may get you some answers
2007-08-08T15:33:00.000Z	remote_		ok, will do that. what would be the prefered way ?
2007-08-08T15:34:00.000Z	LLzzJJ	remote_	an open source driver from the manuf is preffered :), but that may not happen! ndiswrapper is widely used and should give good results.
2007-08-08T15:34:00.000Z	remote_		ok, thanks
2007-08-08T15:34:00.000Z	LLzzJJ	remote_	basically ndiswrapper allows you to use the windows driver
2007-08-08T15:36:00.000Z	remote_		how do i get the ndiswapper?
2007-08-08T15:36:00.000Z	LLzzJJ	remote_	I was under the impression that it comes in the standard kernel
2007-08-08T15:38:00.000Z	LLzzJJ	remote_	you may want to install ndiswrapper-utils, This may help you configure your card. I am pretty sure the help docs are very good on this subject.
2007-08-08T15:38:00.000Z	remote_		where can i find it ?
2007-08-08T15:38:00.000Z	remote_		i can only find ndiswrapper on amd machines there
2007-08-08T15:39:00.000Z	remote_	LLzzJJ	can i find it on my system tools somewhere?
2007-08-08T15:40:00.000Z	LLzzJJ	remote_	As I said, I think it is in ubuntu kernel by default, on your system open  a console and type : locate ndiswrapper.ko
2007-08-08T15:40:00.000Z	remote_		k, thanks
2007-08-08T15:41:00.000Z	LLzzJJ	remote_	that 'should' show you if you have the kernel module, then follow the help docs
