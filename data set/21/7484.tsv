2006-09-20T06:51:00.000Z	exe-cuter	kendals	i don't have any good experience with bot voip and skype using ubuntu
2006-09-20T07:07:00.000Z	exe-cuter	kendals	by installing the flash plug in? :D
2006-09-20T07:07:00.000Z	exe-cuter	kendals	hold on
2006-09-20T07:09:00.000Z	exe-cuter	kendals	http://blog.mypapit.net/2006/08/install-mozilla-flash-plugin-in-ubuntu.html  this helped for me
2006-09-20T07:09:00.000Z	kendals	exe-cuter	thanks, but I already have that- this is a diff window that keeps popping up when I do stuff in synaptics, for no reason :S
2006-09-20T07:10:00.000Z	exe-cuter	kendals	strange ... and your flash is working?
2006-09-20T07:10:00.000Z	kendals	exe-cuter	nope- only with wine firefox....Opera doesn't like the flash even after i install, and neither does native firefox, for that matter.
2006-09-20T07:11:00.000Z	exe-cuter	kendals	ow that s*cks ... did you tried looking for updates (sudo apt-get update)?
2006-09-20T07:11:00.000Z	kendals	exe-cuter	yep, tried that- tried everything...
