2005-08-08T13:25:00.000Z	pestilence	reisio	can you get konsole to do that?
2005-08-08T13:25:00.000Z	pestilence	reisio	(in the title)
2005-08-08T13:26:00.000Z	reisio	pestilence	undoubtedly
2005-08-08T13:26:00.000Z	pestilence	reisio	i have some doubts
2005-08-08T13:27:00.000Z	reisio	pestilence	I don't
2005-08-08T13:27:00.000Z	pestilence	reisio	i'm not talking about prompts
2005-08-08T13:27:00.000Z	pestilence	reisio	i'm talking about the tab title
2005-08-08T13:27:00.000Z	pestilence	reisio	maybe i should have been clearer/maybe i misunderstood what you were discussing
2005-08-08T13:27:00.000Z	reisio	pestilence	so am I
2005-08-08T13:28:00.000Z	reisio	pestilence	it would be ridiculous if konsole couldn't handle it, so I'm almost positive it can
2005-08-08T13:28:00.000Z	reisio	pestilence	this is incredibly old, simple, low-level stuff
2005-08-08T13:28:00.000Z	pestilence	reisio	i don't think konsole gets its title from the prompt
2005-08-08T13:29:00.000Z	pestilence	reisio	ok, so the *title* of the window changes to the prompt.  but not the *tab name*
2005-08-08T13:29:00.000Z	reisio	pestilence	the tab name usually becomes the title
2005-08-08T13:29:00.000Z	reisio	pestilence	but however it works, I'm sure you can do it with Konsole
2005-08-08T13:29:00.000Z	pestilence	reisio	ok.
2005-08-08T13:29:00.000Z	reisio	pestilence	try what that page I linked you says
2005-08-08T13:30:00.000Z	pestilence	reisio	i already have a bashrc that changes the window title based on the path...but the tab names dont' change
2005-08-08T13:31:00.000Z	reisio	pestilence	maybe check preferences or something
2005-08-08T13:31:00.000Z	reisio	pestilence	I almost never use KDE, so I wouldn't know exactly how to do it, but I would be dumbfounded if it couldn't
