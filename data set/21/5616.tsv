2008-06-04T19:34:00.000Z	dbmoodb		adama: please do not swear in this channel if you want a package that works make it your self the ubuntu packages are done slightly differently at times by maintainers to help normal users
2008-06-04T19:34:00.000Z	adamt	dbmoodb	package that works? are you being stupid? this is a package from stable, that broke together with the newest kernel+fixes that was pushes into the repos today
2008-06-04T19:34:00.000Z	dbmoodb	adamt	if you don't like the way a package is made make your own or try a different repo... (perhaps unofficial or go and use debian)
2008-06-04T19:35:00.000Z	dbmoodb	adamt	what package ?
2008-06-04T19:35:00.000Z	adamt	dbmoodb	great standard-answer, do you have any other standard-answers you would like to copy'n'paste to me? :P
2008-06-04T19:35:00.000Z	dbmoodb	adamt	going to tell me which package ?... oh the rt kernel broke ?
2008-06-04T19:37:00.000Z	dbmoodb	adamt	install the generic one and then you will have a failsafe
2008-06-04T19:37:00.000Z	adamt	dbmoodb	i f... can't install anything, due to the way apt works.
2008-06-04T19:38:00.000Z	adamt	dbmoodb	paste coming up.

2008-06-04T19:39:00.000Z	adamt	dbmoodb	you don't need to tell me how a system works, thanks.
2008-06-04T19:40:00.000Z	dbmoodb	adamt	got a boot partition ?
2008-06-04T19:40:00.000Z	adamt	dbmoodb	yes, and it's mounted..
2008-06-04T19:41:00.000Z	dbmoodb	adamt	it says its full ... i hope you are aware of the problem that gives you
2008-06-04T19:42:00.000Z	adamt	dbmoodb	... so it can't remove the package, because it's full? that sounds.. wrong :-)
2008-06-04T19:42:00.000Z	dbmoodb	adamt	i know
2008-06-04T19:49:00.000Z	dbmoodb	adamt	free up some space --- why do you want to even remove that kernel in the first place
2008-06-04T19:49:00.000Z	adamt	dbmoodb	i DID free up plenty of space.
2008-06-04T19:51:00.000Z	adamt	dbmoodb	i did believe you, i fixed the problem, and dpkg STILL is fubar.
2008-06-04T19:52:00.000Z	dbmoodb	adamt	doesn't want to break his system because he is being some what difficult
2008-06-04T19:52:00.000Z	adamt	dbmoodb	what the fuck are you talking about? idiot
