2007-12-15T15:38:00.000Z	mhrnjad	Jordan_U_	it just says: "Segmentation fault (core dumped)"
2007-12-15T15:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	mhrnjad	, Is it giving an error code?
2007-12-15T15:42:00.000Z	mhrnjad	Jordan_U_	I am still here..
2007-12-15T15:42:00.000Z	mhrnjad	Jordan_U_	there is no error code, when invoked grub simply crashes with a core dump
2007-12-15T15:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	mhrnjad	It sounds like you don't really mean the bootloader itself, as in specifically the code that is installed to the MBR and run at boot
2007-12-15T15:49:00.000Z	mhrnjad	Jordan_U_	: I do mean the boat loader binary ..
2007-12-15T15:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	mhrnjad	How can a bootloader segfault?
2007-12-15T15:50:00.000Z	mhrnjad	Jordan_U_	: grub can actually be invoked from the shell ..
2007-12-15T15:50:00.000Z	mhrnjad	Jordan_U_	: e.g. sudo grub
2007-12-15T15:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	mhrnjad	I always thought that was different code, learn something new every day :)
2007-12-15T15:51:00.000Z	mhrnjad	Jordan_U_	it then comes up with a prompt and allows you to issue commands
2007-12-15T15:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	mhrnjad	Having an intel mac and wanting to dual boot before the kinks were all worked out I became very well acquainted with that prompt :) Just didn't realize it "was" grub
2007-12-15T15:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	mhrnjad	I guess it makes sense now that I think about things like it being able to search for a menu.lst on drives that were not mounted by linux
2007-12-15T15:54:00.000Z	mhrnjad	Jordan_U_	: cool, I want to boot FreeBSD but the binary grub package does not have ufs2 support compiled in
2007-12-15T15:54:00.000Z	mhrnjad	Jordan_U_	that's why I wanted to rebuild from source package
2007-12-15T15:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	mhrnjad	Why don't you install grub from FreeBSD?
2007-12-15T15:55:00.000Z	mhrnjad	Jordan_U_	that's a possibility ..
2007-12-15T15:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	mhrnjad	FreeBSD's grub supports ext2
2007-12-15T15:55:00.000Z	mhrnjad	Jordan_U_	thanks for the pointer .. will try that.
2007-12-15T15:56:00.000Z	mhrnjad	Jordan_U_	: Thanks again.
2007-12-15T15:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	mhrnjad	np
