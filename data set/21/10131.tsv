2006-11-26T16:03:00.000Z	wite		So, where all the xammp programs installed by default in serer edition?
2006-11-26T16:04:00.000Z	wite		Doesn't LAMPP/XAMPP come installed in Ubuntu Server Edition, if so, where?
2006-11-26T16:05:00.000Z	wite		Doesn't LAMPP/XAMPP come installed in Ubuntu Server Edition, if so, where?

2006-11-26T16:06:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	wite	if you selected the option upon install, yes
2006-11-26T16:08:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	wite	LAMP is an abbreviation for Linux Apache MySQL and Php, they install in various places
2006-11-26T16:08:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	wite	try /var/www for apache as an example
2006-11-26T16:08:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	wite	you'll have to look around, honestly if you "need" LAMP, you should already know all this
2006-11-26T16:09:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	wite	no offense to you, but tons of people are obsessively installing LAMP lately, I'm not sure why as most don't have any idea what it is or why they would want it.
2006-11-26T16:10:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	wite	what made you think you needed LAMP?
2006-11-26T16:11:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	wite	ahh migrating from an existing install
2006-11-26T16:11:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	wite	that makes more sense, take a look at the startup scripts in /etc/init.d/ for apache and mysql, they should reference the install dirs
2006-11-26T16:12:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	wite	it may be /var/mysql but I'm not positive with the ubuntu packages
2006-11-26T16:13:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	wite	give me a sec, I'll find a link
2006-11-26T16:16:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	wite	sorry none of the sites I found were a good howto, lot of bad advice
2006-11-26T16:17:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	wite	take a look for /etc/my.cnf or a my.cnf in /etc/ somewhere to find the dirs for mysql
2006-11-26T16:17:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	wite	cool
2006-11-26T16:26:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	wite	this should be quite useful for you http://www.tldp.org/LDP/intro-linux/html/chap_03.html
2006-11-26T16:35:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	wite	check that link I pasted for you before, it covers all the filesystem basics
