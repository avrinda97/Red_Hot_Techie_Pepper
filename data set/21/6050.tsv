2008-03-26T13:54:00.000Z	HSorgYves		morning
2008-03-26T13:55:00.000Z	HSorgYves		why can't i access this file (-rwsr-x---  1 root www-data 10244 2008-01-27 19:19 suexec) when I am in the www-data group?
2008-03-26T13:55:00.000Z	unop	HSorgYves	because the group www-data does not own the file
2008-03-26T13:56:00.000Z	HSorgYves	unop	but it has r-x on it, what do I overlook?
2008-03-26T13:56:00.000Z	unop	HSorgYves	forget the permissions -- look at the ownership
2008-03-26T13:57:00.000Z	HSorgYves	unop	it is owned by root; but other files can be accessed by groups why not this one?
2008-03-26T13:59:00.000Z	unop	HSorgYves	see it's like this -- the group root and the user www-data own the file .. but the permissions are 4750 .. now your user is a member of the www-data group, but that group has no read permissions on the file, so how do you expect to be able to access it?
2008-03-26T14:01:00.000Z	HSorgYves	unop	permissions are --5-, why doesn't the group have read permission then? 5 = r + x???
2008-03-26T14:01:00.000Z	unop	HSorgYves	either change the ownership of the file to make the group www-data the owner, or open change permissions so the world can read it .. sudo chown www-data.www-data file   or  sudo chmod 4755 file
2008-03-26T14:02:00.000Z	unop	HSorgYves	which group owns that file?  and you should answer your question yourself :)
2008-03-26T14:02:00.000Z	HSorgYves	unop	i know the workarounds... group? root owns the file
2008-03-26T14:03:00.000Z	unop	HSorgYves	right root owns the file, is your user a member of root?
2008-03-26T14:03:00.000Z	HSorgYves	unop	the user root owns the file not the group or am i completely wrong here?
2008-03-26T14:03:00.000Z	unop	HSorgYves	i think you need to read the output of ls -l file more carefully -- www-data is the user that owns it
2008-03-26T14:09:00.000Z	HSorgYves	unop	-rwsr-x---  1 root www-data <-- root is the user and www-data is the group isn't it?
2008-03-26T14:09:00.000Z	unop	HSorgYves	other way around
2008-03-26T14:14:00.000Z	HSorgYves	unop	no, that's not true, why should group be before owner?
2010-03-06T03:44:00.000Z	unop	HSorgYves	 find /path/to/dir -type d -exec chmod 777 {} +  ;  find /path/to/dir -type f -exec chmod 666 {} +
2010-03-06T03:44:00.000Z	HSorgYves	unop	thx
2010-03-06T03:45:00.000Z	unop	HSorgYves	or ... chmod -R 666 /path/to/dir;  chmod -R +X /path/to/dir
2010-03-06T03:56:00.000Z	HSorgYves	unop	even better, thx
