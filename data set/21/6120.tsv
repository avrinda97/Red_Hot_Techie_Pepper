2007-07-05T12:57:00.000Z	eternalswd	shiester_miester	yep, dyndns.org is a lifesaver for dynamic ip ;)
2007-07-05T13:05:00.000Z	shiester_miester	eternalswd	what was the proxy software that worked in a way reminiscent of the bittorrent protocol?  it routed the connection through other peers, who may also route a connection through you
2007-07-05T13:06:00.000Z	eternalswd	shiester_miester	that is what tor does, but it also makes it incredibly slow
2007-07-05T13:11:00.000Z	eternalswd	shiester_miester	and though IE7 is more compliant to standards, they changed the way in which it parses the specialized comments, so now some of my code looks really ugly with multiple comments for IE!=7 and IE=7. yuck
2007-07-05T13:12:00.000Z	shiester_miester	eternalswd	what comments are you talking about?
2007-07-05T13:12:00.000Z	eternalswd	shiester_miester	hold on, let me find one
2007-07-05T13:19:00.000Z	eternalswd	shiester_miester	example of the specialized comments at http://www.pastebin.ca/604008 and believe it was entirely necessary to do it that way :(
2007-07-05T13:22:00.000Z	shiester_miester	eternalswd	thanks
2007-07-05T13:27:00.000Z	eternalswd	shiester_miester	notice the <!--[if !IE] > --> need to end comment right afterwards or firefox, opera, etc will see the whole block meant for non-IE browsers as a comment.  Before with IE6a and lower it wouldn't have seen an end to the specialized comment block without the ![endif] , but IE7 changed that so what should only need one specialized comment block now requires two :(
2007-07-05T13:32:00.000Z	eternalswd	shiester_miester	or rather, I just remembered what the problem was, IE7 was outputting the --> which was needed for firefox etc.  So I had to add a specialized block for IE7 with the exact same content as for firefox etc without the --> immediately following the conditional comment opening.  grrr Microsoft, even when they fix stuff, it messes things up
2007-07-05T13:33:00.000Z	shiester_miester	eternalswd	you could still do all that with php, its a very simple script
2007-07-05T13:33:00.000Z	shiester_miester	eternalswd	see privmsg
2007-07-05T13:35:00.000Z	eternalswd	shiester_miester	unfortunately no due to the fact that opera can go around masquerading as IE and if the user doesn't specify to add opera to the user agent string, php cannot tell the difference, believe me, I tried.  the problems originate with poor javascript browser sniffers that wouldn't support opera
2007-07-05T13:37:00.000Z	eternalswd	shiester_miester	that's the problem, it doesn't use any IE-specific code, it just changes the user agent string sent to the server
2007-07-05T13:42:00.000Z	eternalswd	shiester_miester	you should have waited a development cycle then you could have had a GUTSY GRANDPA ;)

2007-07-05T13:59:00.000Z	eternalswd	shiester_miester	ever taken a gander at wine's source code?  it's a mucky mire thanks to how microsoft develops it's platform
2007-07-05T14:01:00.000Z	eternalswd	shiester_miester	at one point I was using wine to run utorrent until deluge got up to speed because azureus=hog imo.  but I wanted my nice xcursors to be used.  so I took a gander and the cursor is hidden inside reference within reference until one loses track of it altogether.  It's in some hardcoded resource somewhere.
2007-07-05T14:04:00.000Z	eternalswd	shiester_miester	and if one wants to change the cursor in Xwindows, it takes a few calls at most.  Windows=complex bloat ;)
2007-07-05T14:04:00.000Z	shiester_miester	eternalswd	whaaaat
