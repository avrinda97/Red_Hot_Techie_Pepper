2008-08-30T02:29:00.000Z	LjL		is there any way for my process to know whether the sigint or sigkill it receives is due to a system shutdown (and the warning message if there is any)?
2008-08-30T02:31:00.000Z	guntbert	LjL	why would that be important?
2008-08-30T02:31:00.000Z	LjL	guntbert	because my process needs to output the fact that the system is being rebooted, and why.
2008-08-30T02:39:00.000Z	guntbert	LjL	have a look at http://linux.die.net/man/8/shutdown, "All processes are first notified that the system is going down by the signal SIGTERM "

2009-10-24T01:43:00.000Z	guntbert	LjL	are you sure that irony is in place here? ("generic")
2009-10-24T01:44:00.000Z	LjL	guntbert	i am sure that trolling isn't, and i strongly suspect this is a case of it
2009-10-24T01:45:00.000Z	guntbert	LjL	Scunizi maybe your noses are more sensitive :)
2010-05-16T02:55:00.000Z	guntbert	LjL	about hibernation and swap -- if your system actually uses the swap space while running you will need a bigger amount for hibernation
2010-05-16T02:56:00.000Z	LjL	guntbert	well, yes and no... i mean, it's possible, but it's also possible that the system is just swapping out applications' memory to make space for file cache, in which case it'll just do away with the file cache when you shutdown
2010-05-16T02:57:00.000Z	LjL	guntbert	an unlikely enough even that i wouldn't bother considering it when assigning swap, in any case
2010-05-16T02:59:00.000Z	guntbert	LjL	good point (1) -- but I'd still advocate swap = ram *1.5 or so (especially on notebooks where hibernating may occour at the worst time possible
2010-05-16T03:00:00.000Z	LjL	guntbert	if we're speaking in the league of 4 or 8 gigs as we are, i really believe that makes no sense. if you're using swap for any other reason than freeing up memory for file cache, then it means your system has already slowed to a halt already
2010-05-16T03:01:00.000Z	LjL	guntbert	if you want to cater for the unlikely and mostly useless events, on the other hand, then you need infinite memory ;)
2010-05-16T03:04:00.000Z	guntbert	LjL	thx, accepted :-)  I guess I didn't make a clear picture for myself about for what swap is really used
2011-05-04T01:58:00.000Z	guntbert	LjL	pm?
2011-05-04T01:58:00.000Z	LjL	guntbert	anytime
2012-02-01T02:22:00.000Z	LjL	guntbert	it's an Ubuntu package, it doesn't seem that far off to me
2012-02-01T02:22:00.000Z	guntbert	LjL	ok :)
2012-03-01T02:32:00.000Z	LjL	guntbert	to switch to another user "su" would be appropriate, though. and it should be SUID root
2012-03-01T02:33:00.000Z	guntbert	LjL	ack
