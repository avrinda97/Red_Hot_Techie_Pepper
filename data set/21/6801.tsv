2007-12-05T00:48:00.000Z	SpookyET		Is there a deb of the latest rTorrent 0.7.9 I believe? The rTorrent in the repository is too old, and it does not support DHT and peer exchange. I'm having tracker timeouts issues.
2007-12-05T00:48:00.000Z	kelsin	SpookyET	hardy has 0.7.8 is that high enough?
2007-12-05T00:50:00.000Z	SpookyET	kelsin	I'll take 0.7.8 if it's not the one on the ubuntu forums which has a dependency issue.
2007-12-05T00:50:00.000Z	kelsin	SpookyET	If you want to try .7.8 you should read up on how to backport a package, it's pretty easy, involves adding the deb-src lines to your /etc/apt/sources.lst then running "apt-get build-dep <package> && apt-get source --compile <package>"
2007-12-13T07:29:00.000Z	kelsin	SpookyET	how did you install the hacked up version, from a deb, or from a source tar.gz?
2007-12-13T07:31:00.000Z	SpookyET	kelsin	deb. That's why I have both listed under Versions in the package properties in Synaptic. I can switch between them. For example, I have libgtk2.0-0 version 2.12.0-1ubuntu3.1 (now) and 2.12.0-1ubuntu3 (gutsy). I want to uninstall the (now).
2007-12-13T07:32:00.000Z	SpookyET	kelsin	I want to do something like dpkg --purge --version 2.12.0-1ubuntu3.1 libgtk2.0-0
2007-12-13T07:34:00.000Z	kelsin	SpookyET	if it's done via that synaptic interface it probably means both can't be installed at once, so does forcing the gutsy version solve the issue?
2007-12-13T07:35:00.000Z	SpookyET	kelsin	Yeah, I'm running the gutsy version. My question is how do I remove the hacked up version from the database.
2007-12-13T07:35:00.000Z	kelsin	SpookyET	how did you install it in the first place?
2007-12-13T07:36:00.000Z	SpookyET	kelsin	deb, but they are not listed as 2 separate debs. they are listed under the same package, but it allows you to choose between the versions
2007-12-13T07:36:00.000Z	kelsin	SpookyET	oh like individual deb? not adding a 3rdparty repo?
2007-12-13T07:36:00.000Z	SpookyET	kelsin	Yeah. individual deb.
2007-12-13T07:36:00.000Z	kelsin	SpookyET	and it's still there after you "Reload" in synaptic?
2007-12-13T07:37:00.000Z	kelsin	SpookyET	also try search for the deb file on your system and removing it from the apt cache
2007-12-13T07:38:00.000Z	SpookyET	kelsin	I don't see apt-cache remove
2007-12-13T07:38:00.000Z	kelsin	SpookyET	I meant remove the deb package from the place on the filesystem where apt stores debs, not anything to do with the apt-cache command, looking for the path now
2007-12-13T07:39:00.000Z	kelsin	SpookyET	if the deb is in /var/cache/apt/archives remove it, then reload and see if it's still an options
2007-12-13T07:40:00.000Z	SpookyET	kelsin	It's clean. There are no debs there
2007-12-13T07:40:00.000Z	kelsin	SpookyET	then I have no idea, have to ask someone that has more knowledge of apt internals than me
2007-12-15T09:12:00.000Z	SpookyET	kelsin	any wise words for my issue?
