2006-01-21T16:35:00.000Z	pashaw	TK4222	why dont you mount it normally  using fstab?
2006-01-21T16:36:00.000Z	TK4222	pashaw	doesnt mount either there
2006-01-21T16:36:00.000Z	pashaw	TK4222	  you did read the wiki rignt?
2006-01-21T16:37:00.000Z	TK4222	pashaw	yah of course on smb mounting but maybe i missed something?
2006-01-21T16:42:00.000Z	pashaw	TK4222	you sure the share  isnt reading your logged in username/password
2006-01-21T16:42:00.000Z	TK4222	pashaw	its running as a guest connect
2006-01-21T16:42:00.000Z	pashaw	TK4222	  thats why it probably works when your booted and logged in
2006-01-21T16:43:00.000Z	TK4222	pashaw	not sure i understand since im trying to connect as guest
2006-01-21T16:43:00.000Z	pashaw	TK4222	 you could always make a new user and try it quick
2006-01-21T16:43:00.000Z	TK4222	pashaw	hmmm okay..or mabye -user=guest?
2006-01-21T16:44:00.000Z	pashaw	TK4222	   thoguht you said earlier it worked wihtout that whicle logged in
2006-01-21T16:45:00.000Z	TK4222	pashaw	it works after i have booted up
2006-01-21T16:45:00.000Z	pashaw	TK4222	  thats why i thought it maight be passing your loginname and password  of the logged in user
2006-01-21T16:46:00.000Z	TK4222	pashaw	probably
2006-01-21T16:46:00.000Z	pashaw	TK4222	  the wiki explains clearly how to use SMB with users/passwords  using fstab
2006-01-21T16:46:00.000Z	TK4222	pashaw	oh yeah i know that but it doesnt reference guest a lot
2006-01-21T16:47:00.000Z	pashaw	TK4222	  guest is bad practice IMHO
2006-01-21T16:47:00.000Z	pashaw	TK4222	  just setup a low security share
2006-01-21T16:51:00.000Z	TK4222	pashaw	i know its just a local network i could care less about though okay it worked but prompted me for a password with username=guest trying now username=guest,password=''
2006-01-21T16:52:00.000Z	pashaw	TK4222	 for that i always make a share  with user/pass  linux/linux     then you add that to the fstab setup and it auto mounts your basic share
2006-01-21T16:53:00.000Z	TK4222	pashaw	that worked what i just did thanks.....weird that -o guest doesnt work on automounting
