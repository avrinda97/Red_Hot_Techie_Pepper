2012-03-05T23:03:00.000Z	Dear		I have an issue. Just recently when I reboot or shut down and start up again I can't use my keyboard or mouse for about 2 minutes. This creates a problem for me since I can't choose what OS to boot into. This is something that just happen very recently and both the keyboard and mouse was working find for years. Any ideas? Thanks
2012-03-05T23:05:00.000Z	Benkinooby	Dear	so you cant use them even if you are in grub?
2012-03-05T23:06:00.000Z	Benkinooby	Dear	can you use your keyboard BEFORE you get to grub... e.g. to get to BIOS?
2012-03-05T23:07:00.000Z	Benkinooby	Dear	do you have an usb or PS2 keyboard at hand for testing?
2012-03-05T23:08:00.000Z	Benkinooby	Dear	so the wireless keyboard adapter is unplugged, the other keyboard is mounted and still the problem appears?
2012-03-05T23:13:00.000Z	Dear	Benkinooby	Can you think of any reason that this just recently occured? I mean it was working fine for years.
2012-03-05T23:13:00.000Z	Benkinooby	Dear	first shot would be: it's old
2012-03-05T23:13:00.000Z	Benkinooby	Dear	do you also have a ps/2 keyboard for testing?

2012-03-05T23:15:00.000Z	Benkinooby	Dear	hm, i don't know any further... try unplug as much as possible and only leave the keyboard on
2012-03-05T23:16:00.000Z	Benkinooby	Dear	maybe some connector or somethings blocks a fast hardware recognition
2012-03-05T23:16:00.000Z	Dear	Benkinooby	no ps/2 bk for testing :( i don't even  think this PC has a ps/2 port. lol  been awhile since i looked behind my PC though. OK I will try that. Thanks
