2005-10-27T07:04:00.000Z	HappyFool	sunshine82	hi :). computer working?
2005-10-27T07:09:00.000Z	HappyFool	sunshine82	i missed part of this conversation - what are you trying to do?
2005-10-27T07:12:00.000Z	HappyFool	sunshine82	i've never setup a webcam, i don't know
2005-10-27T07:12:00.000Z	HappyFool	sunshine82	if you've extracted the tarball, look in the directory just created for a 'README' or 'INSTALL' file
2005-10-27T07:15:00.000Z	HappyFool	sunshine82	ok, so do that
2005-10-27T07:19:00.000Z	HappyFool	sunshine82	you need to run 'make' in the directory you created
2005-10-27T07:19:00.000Z	HappyFool	sunshine82	there should be a file called 'Makefile' or 'makefile' there
2005-10-27T07:21:00.000Z	HappyFool	sunshine82	oops
2005-10-27T07:21:00.000Z	HappyFool	sunshine82	you pasted
2005-10-27T07:21:00.000Z	HappyFool	sunshine82	and Seveas was watching
2005-10-27T07:21:00.000Z	HappyFool	sunshine82	it looks like this is a fairly technical package
2005-10-27T07:24:00.000Z	HappyFool	sunshine82	what happens if you run make ?
2005-10-27T07:25:00.000Z	HappyFool	sunshine82	as long as you are not using sudo, you can't break the computer *too* much
2005-10-27T07:33:00.000Z	HappyFool	sunshine82	i think it's 'video for linux', but i don't know much more
2005-10-27T14:23:00.000Z	HappyFool	sunshine82	sorry, no
2005-11-06T14:00:00.000Z	HappyFool	sunshine82	the old wiki url seems to no longer be working
2005-11-06T14:00:00.000Z	HappyFool	sunshine82	try https://wiki.ubuntu.com
