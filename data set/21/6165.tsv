2007-05-20T05:01:00.000Z	Magus-		is PPC Ubuntu supported as well as x86/etc are?
2007-05-20T05:01:00.000Z	Magus-		I have both an Intel and PPC Mac Mini and I'd like to put Ubuntu on one of them, but I'm not sure which would be better
2007-05-20T05:03:00.000Z	Magus-		some do HOT, so you're wrong
2007-05-20T05:03:00.000Z	Magus-		the end
2007-05-20T05:04:00.000Z	Magus-		sure they do - people play WoW, EVE, etc
2007-05-20T05:04:00.000Z	Magus-		STFU until you know what you're talking about
2007-05-20T05:05:00.000Z	Magus-		so... ubuntu ppc - worth using, or should I stick to x86? :)
2007-05-20T05:05:00.000Z	ianm	Magus-	stick to x86 if you have the option
2007-05-20T05:05:00.000Z	Magus-	ianm	any particular reason? or just worse in general?
2007-05-20T05:06:00.000Z	Magus-		(I have both an Intel and PPC mac mini available to be used, so I do have the option either way)
2007-05-20T05:06:00.000Z	ianm	Magus-	most things will be fine but some closed-source things, such as browser Flash Players, don't have a PPC version
2007-05-20T05:06:00.000Z	Magus-	ianm	this would be server only
2007-05-20T05:06:00.000Z	Magus-		no desktop use
2007-05-20T05:06:00.000Z	Magus-		no X either
2007-05-20T05:06:00.000Z	Magus-		:)
2007-05-20T05:06:00.000Z	ianm	Magus-	ah, that would probably be fine then
2007-05-20T05:08:00.000Z	Magus-		then it isn't a rar file
2007-05-20T05:08:00.000Z	Magus-		iso is just associated with winrar
2007-05-20T05:08:00.000Z	Magus-		don't extract it
2007-05-20T05:08:00.000Z	Magus-	ianm	do you happen to know if the installer can resize a mac partition like it can ntfs?
2007-05-20T05:09:00.000Z	ianm	Magus-	no, sorry
