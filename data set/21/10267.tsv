2005-04-26T14:06:00.000Z	bwb		OT
2005-04-26T14:06:00.000Z	bwb		hrm
2005-04-26T14:06:00.000Z	bwb		weird bitchx completion
2005-04-26T14:06:00.000Z	LiberalTugboat	bwb	are you a hardcore overclocker?
2005-04-26T14:06:00.000Z	bwb	LiberalTugboat	no
2005-04-26T14:06:00.000Z	bwb	LiberalTugboat	see just found a deal for pc3200 for $20 per stick
2005-04-26T14:07:00.000Z	bwb	LiberalTugboat	so you don't think double the price would be worth the decrease in latency?
2005-04-26T14:08:00.000Z	LiberalTugboat	bwb	unless you have a $2000 gaming machine that is overclocked to the max
2005-04-26T14:11:00.000Z	bwb	LiberalTugboat	dunno, I think some 800mhz (quad ddr) thing that was specific to this p4
2005-04-26T14:11:00.000Z	bwb	LiberalTugboat	I'd upgrade my machine before using the memory
2005-04-26T14:12:00.000Z	bwb	LiberalTugboat	yah, which is why it will be a windows machine (for various eng/school software I need to run) while my desktop will remain linux
2005-04-26T14:12:00.000Z	bwb	LiberalTugboat	yeah..
2005-04-26T14:12:00.000Z	bwb	LiberalTugboat	hrm you mentioned oc'ing... it wouldn't have any negative effect on trying to oc if I have a multiplier unlocked cpu i don't think tho
2005-04-26T14:13:00.000Z	bwb	LiberalTugboat	ie I was thinking of getting an athlon mobility and oc'ing it
2005-04-26T14:13:00.000Z	LiberalTugboat	bwb	they are great for OCing if you have good cooling and the right mobo
2005-04-26T14:13:00.000Z	bwb	LiberalTugboat	yah hrm..
2005-04-26T14:13:00.000Z	bwb	LiberalTugboat	alka_trash: any recommendations on mobos for that?
2005-04-26T14:18:00.000Z	LiberalTugboat	bwb	my DELL 1905fp lcd came in the mail today
2005-04-26T14:18:00.000Z	bwb	LiberalTugboat	yah?
2005-04-26T14:21:00.000Z	LiberalTugboat	bwb	that proc with an Abit NF7 SG2 would be killer for OC
