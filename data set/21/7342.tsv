2006-10-19T06:33:00.000Z	strabes		joecot: is there an iceweasel directory in /usr/share? also check for icons in /usr/share/pixmaps and /usr/share/pixmaps/iceweasel
2006-10-19T06:34:00.000Z	strabes		joecot: those seem to be the most common directories for applications icons
2006-10-19T06:36:00.000Z	anon32	strabes	that breaks the dist-upgrade command though
2006-10-19T06:36:00.000Z	strabes	anon32	why cuz it removes ubuntu-desktop?
2006-10-19T06:36:00.000Z	anon32	strabes	yea
2006-10-19T06:36:00.000Z	anon32	strabes	and download rhytmbox again?
2006-10-19T06:37:00.000Z	strabes	anon32	i dunno lol that was my solution; rhythmbox sux. i dont use dist-upgrade anyway. what did you do to stop rhythmbox from opening with an ipod?
2006-10-19T06:37:00.000Z	anon32	strabes	don't have an ipod
2006-10-19T06:38:00.000Z	anon32	strabes	but the setting is it system -> administration -> removable moedia
2006-10-19T06:38:00.000Z	strabes	anon32	oh thanks for the tip
2006-10-19T06:45:00.000Z	anon32	strabes	meh... stuff like iceweasel just causes fragmentation in the OSS community
2006-10-19T06:45:00.000Z	strabes	anon32	indeed it does; it's just funny
2006-10-19T06:52:00.000Z	anon32	strabes	it is possible, but that completely ruins file permissions
2006-10-19T06:52:00.000Z	strabes	anon32	oh ok. my windows is on ntfs but i have a fat32 partition for linux/windows file sharing
2006-10-19T07:09:00.000Z	strabes	anon32	why do people even use mail apps when there is gmail?
2006-10-19T07:09:00.000Z	anon32	strabes	because when you go to gmail there's the loading and also the ads
2006-10-19T07:10:00.000Z	strabes	anon32	- good reason
2006-10-19T07:10:00.000Z	strabes	anon32	i don't mind however
2006-10-19T07:29:00.000Z	anon32	strabes	clearly this has to do with pr0n
2006-10-19T07:29:00.000Z	strabes	anon32	what? lol
2006-10-19T07:29:00.000Z	strabes	anon32	hopefully not pr0n lol
