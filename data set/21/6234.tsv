2007-06-21T11:02:00.000Z	ziroday	wols	i think you re going a bit overboard now
2007-06-21T11:03:00.000Z	wols	ziroday	mission critical: not to be trifled with. that's why it's mission criztical. you don't even install patches without testing them first on another bix, cause the other one is mission critical. you certiainly don't install a new OS you don't know anything about
2007-06-21T11:04:00.000Z	ziroday	wols	i suppose theres diff between mission critical and home usage, home you dont want to break but if it breaks you need to fix ti
2007-06-21T11:04:00.000Z	wols	ziroday	n2diy was saying mission critical
2007-06-21T12:07:00.000Z	wols	ziroday	never ever use automatix, period
