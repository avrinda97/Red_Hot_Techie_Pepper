2007-05-03T16:26:00.000Z	variant	War1	reboot to normal mode and login as normal, (presumably the windows will be messed up still) then press ctrl alt f1 and you will be put in a virtual terminal, from there you can login and type "killall beryl", then press ctrl alt f7 to get back to the (hopefully now working) gui
2007-05-03T16:27:00.000Z	variant	War1	you could have done that without rebooting..
