2005-06-09T10:11:00.000Z	Rotundo		can someone help me with sound in Hoary, I fresh installed today and I cannot seem to get any sound, I've got a VIA 8235 AC97 onboard sound, all the modules appear to be loaded and no channels are muted, any pointers on where to look would be greatly appreciated.
2005-06-09T10:11:00.000Z	crimsun	Rotundo	paste the output from ,,amixer'' onto http://pastebin.com
2005-06-09T10:13:00.000Z	crimsun	Rotundo	just paste amixer output to pastebin
2005-06-09T10:14:00.000Z	Rotundo	crimsun	done
2005-06-09T10:14:00.000Z	crimsun	Rotundo	unmute PCM and mute IEC958 Capture Monitor
2005-06-09T10:16:00.000Z	Rotundo	crimsun	I cannot mute IEC958... but unmuting PCM did nothing.
2005-06-09T10:16:00.000Z	crimsun	Rotundo	you need to follow my directions
2005-06-09T10:16:00.000Z	crimsun	Rotundo	both of those settings must be toggled
2005-06-09T10:16:00.000Z	crimsun	Rotundo	use amixer
2005-06-09T10:16:00.000Z	Rotundo	crimsun	I cannot toggle the iec setting with alsamixer
2005-06-09T10:16:00.000Z	crimsun	Rotundo	not alsamixer, amixer
2005-06-09T10:18:00.000Z	Rotundo	crimsun	thanks
2005-06-09T10:18:00.000Z	Rotundo	crimsun	didnt know about amixer :)
2005-06-09T10:19:00.000Z	Rotundo	crimsun	it sounds distorted
2005-06-09T10:20:00.000Z	crimsun	Rotundo	make sure the pcm level isn't up too high
2005-06-09T10:24:00.000Z	Rotundo	crimsun	the sound is distorted regardless of the levels I set
2005-06-09T10:25:00.000Z	crimsun	Rotundo	with esd or alsa direct?
2005-06-09T10:25:00.000Z	Rotundo	crimsun	it was esd
2005-06-09T10:25:00.000Z	crimsun	Rotundo	try using alsa directly instead of using esd
2005-06-09T10:26:00.000Z	Rotundo	crimsun	sans esd everything sounds great
2005-06-09T10:31:00.000Z	Rotundo	crimsun	thanks a lot for all the help.
