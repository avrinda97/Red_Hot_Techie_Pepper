2007-01-26T10:17:00.000Z	Linuturk		my ubuntu dapper server locked up at about 12:30 am this morning. Are there any logs I can check?
2007-01-26T10:18:00.000Z	mnoir	Linuturk	start with /var/log - do an ls -latr there to see the most often written ones
2007-01-26T10:19:00.000Z	Linuturk	mnoir	what am I looking for?
2007-01-26T10:20:00.000Z	mnoir	Linuturk	i don't know - mostly what was happening when the sys locked up - you are on a treasure hunt  :)
2007-01-26T10:21:00.000Z	mnoir	Linuturk	depending on the cause, you might see nothing that helps
2007-01-26T10:22:00.000Z	mnoir	Linuturk	are ther entries after you know it 'locked up'?
2007-01-26T10:23:00.000Z	mnoir	Linuturk	if so then you will need to narrow your definition of 'locked up'
2007-01-26T10:24:00.000Z	Linuturk	mnoir	well, the machine locked up at 12:30 am this morning. that's 00:30 here. The last entry I have before that time is yesterday at 15:21
2007-01-26T10:24:00.000Z	Linuturk	mnoir	starting with the udev log
2007-01-26T10:25:00.000Z	mnoir	Linuturk	 no logs altered after that time?? hmm - there should atleast be a heartbeat in messages
2007-01-26T10:25:00.000Z	mnoir	Linuturk	lines that look like:               Jan 26 11:18:21 localhost -- MARK --
2007-01-26T10:26:00.000Z	mnoir	Linuturk	normally every half hour
2007-01-26T10:26:00.000Z	Linuturk	mnoir	those would be in the actual logs, right?
2007-01-26T10:28:00.000Z	mnoir	Linuturk	in the log file NAMED messages
2007-01-26T10:28:00.000Z	Linuturk	mnoir	how do i view the logs? in a text editor? can't I grep them somehow?
2007-01-26T10:28:00.000Z	mnoir	Linuturk	they are conventional text files - all the tools in linux that work on text files can be used
2007-01-26T10:29:00.000Z	Linuturk	mnoir	and what is the best way to grep those files?
2007-01-26T10:29:00.000Z	mnoir	Linuturk	the best way to grep a text file is with grep.  I do not understand the question.
2007-01-26T10:30:00.000Z	mnoir	Linuturk	you are on a treasure hunt - perusing the file with less, most or a text editor would be my choice
2007-01-26T10:31:00.000Z	Linuturk	mnoir	JaXxon instead of opening up the log in nano, how do I query the text file via cli? dmesg /var/log/messages | grep mark ?
2007-01-26T10:31:00.000Z	mnoir	Linuturk	pls join me in #ubuntu-classroom
