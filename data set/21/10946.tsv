2009-09-11T20:58:00.000Z	Turbolinux		I am asking again. I am wanting to connecting a Windows computer from Ubuntu. I installed RealVNC on Windows but I can't connect despite writing the IP adress and the port number of the computer. What I must do?
2009-09-11T20:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Turbolinux	 on a local lan? Or internet?
2009-09-11T20:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Turbolinux	 you have to ssh tunnle vnc that way most likely.. just straight vnc is insecure
2009-11-01T23:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Turbolinux	 you could do a 'live cd type install' to the flash drive.. or use the alternative installer cd   for a full  install. it asks where to put grub at the end of the install i belive
2009-11-01T23:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Turbolinux	 you proberly dont need to do a 'normal' type install to a flash drive
2009-11-01T23:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Turbolinux	 the usb-creator-tool for ubuntu can make a persistant install setup. or you can install a live setup with unetbootin and check pendrivelinux.com to see what changes to make to the syslinux.cfg to turn itinto a persistant install
2009-11-02T00:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Turbolinux	 only differance from a persistant setup and non-persistant is a kernel boot option, and a special file for the changes.
2009-11-02T00:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Turbolinux	 a persistant usb install uses fat32 for the pendrive and ext2/3 for the persistant save file..  if thats what you are asking about.
2010-01-15T17:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Turbolinux	  You can install the ubuntu-desktop pacakge if you want.
2010-01-15T17:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Turbolinux	 but its a bit of an annoyance changeing from one to the other.. its doable however.  Just not as easy as it should be
2010-01-15T17:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Turbolinux	 theres just some annoyanced you have to watch out for.   settings in teh UNR vs the normal desktop can cause  things to not work as well as they should
2010-09-16T18:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Turbolinux	 You need to use virtualbox from teh VBOX homepage not the 'free/ose' version in the repos. in order for vbox to see usb devices.
2010-09-16T18:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Turbolinux	 a quick read of teh virtualbox manual/pdf from their homepage expalins how to set it up to access usb devices. Ive rarely needed to do so, add the device in the config settings, then a button/menu at the bottom of the vbox window is all i rember.
2010-09-22T16:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Turbolinux	 you mean you want to set the DNS servers your system is using?
2010-09-22T17:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Turbolinux	 you could just edit  /etc/resolv.conf   , somehow i got a custome DNS entry in there in addation to my isp's
2010-09-22T17:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Turbolinux	 the file /etc/resolv.conf has the DNS server settings used by the system. But network manager might overwrite/change that file.
2010-09-22T17:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Turbolinux	 i just edited my /etc/resolv.conf by hand.. and  the change took affect. I rarely use network manager to change the stuff like that.
2010-09-22T17:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Turbolinux	 you may need to set it to be a static ip in network manager. i seem to recall others having to do this int he past
2010-09-22T17:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Turbolinux	 i notice that network manager has a 'auto DHCP - address only' setting.. that would i think let you change the dns
2010-09-22T17:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Turbolinux	 the user you are logged in as has sudo rights?
2010-09-22T17:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Turbolinux	 no idea then. I can change them here with no issues. Or i can just edit the /etc/resolv.conf if i want to change it quickly. but NM may overwrite tose changes on the next reboot.
