2009-12-10T12:24:00.000Z	khensthoth	newtoubuntu2	Are you able to access the panels now?
2009-12-10T12:25:00.000Z	newtoubuntu2	khensthoth	when i right click on either top or bottom, nothing happens. not only that, the new panel disappeared.
2009-12-10T12:28:00.000Z	khensthoth	newtoubuntu2	How about resetting the GNOME panels? http://www.celsius1414.com/2006/08/31/how-to-reset-gnome-panel-to-default-in-ubuntugnome2
2009-12-10T12:29:00.000Z	newtoubuntu2	khensthoth	i'll try that, but i cant get to terminal. i was thinking about making a launcher, but couldnt find term either.
2009-12-10T12:30:00.000Z	khensthoth	newtoubuntu2	Alt+F1 to get Ubuntu menu, Alt+F2 to get the Run Application prompt.
2009-12-10T12:31:00.000Z	newtoubuntu2	khensthoth	any suggestions if ALT+F1 and ALT+F2 dont work?
2009-12-10T12:32:00.000Z	newtoubuntu2	khensthoth	also would like to mention that when i shutdown/reboot, there is a popup that says "panel" is not responding
2009-12-10T12:32:00.000Z	khensthoth	newtoubuntu2	Ctrl+Alt+F1 to get to a console, run the commands, Ctrl+Alt+F7 to go back.
2009-12-10T12:33:00.000Z	newtoubuntu2	khensthoth	thanks, that worked, i got to console. however when i do try to rm ~panel, it says that there is no such file or directory
2009-12-10T12:34:00.000Z	khensthoth	newtoubuntu2	rm -r ~/.gconf/apps/panel
2009-12-10T12:35:00.000Z	newtoubuntu2	khensthoth	how did you find that info? i.e. what should i type into google to find this type of tip?
2009-12-10T12:37:00.000Z	khensthoth	newtoubuntu2	Google: resetting Gnome Panel. Actually, ~/.gconf contains a lot of your gnome settings and configurations. In fact, ~/.(AppName) usually are configurations for that App as well, so if you have a problem, just delete those folder. Make a backup and be careful though.
2009-12-10T12:38:00.000Z	newtoubuntu2	khensthoth	& ardchoille: many thanks for the help :)

2009-12-10T12:55:00.000Z	newtoubuntu2	khensthoth	how did u find that? i'll take a look, but it seems to require more skill with ubuntu than i have.
