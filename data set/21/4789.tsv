2008-02-09T15:19:00.000Z	ubuuntu		is there a way to install from the CD and exclude writing over /home ?
2008-02-09T15:19:00.000Z	ubuuntu		re-install i mean..
2008-02-09T15:20:00.000Z	orphean	ubuuntu	by far the easiest would be to backup /home then resintall.
2008-02-09T15:20:00.000Z	ubuuntu	orphean	yeah.. but I don't have equipment for that :(
2008-02-09T15:22:00.000Z	orphean	ubuuntu	if the size of /home makes it prohibitive to upload somewhere or burn it to a cd, you could create a partition and throw it on there, then reinstall, move /home back, and get rid of the partition.
2008-02-09T15:22:00.000Z	ubuuntu	orphean	good idea but I don't have enough space on the hd :(
2008-02-09T15:23:00.000Z	orphean	ubuuntu	why do you need to reinstall?
2008-02-09T15:24:00.000Z	ubuuntu	orphean	I have made every update available since upgrading to 7.10 but now I'm getting make dep errors every time I try to upgrade and it's all a mess
2008-02-09T15:24:00.000Z	orphean		ah
2008-02-09T15:26:00.000Z	orphean	ubuuntu	how brave are you? ;)  You could boot into the livecd, mount the drive, delete everything but the /home directory and then do the partition thing and reinstall.
2008-02-09T15:27:00.000Z	ubuuntu	orphean	what do you mean with the partition thing? do you mean manually create them in fdisk?
2008-02-09T15:27:00.000Z	orphean	ubuuntu	well you could use gparted on the livecd. that would be far easier.
2008-02-09T15:29:00.000Z	ubuuntu	orphean	let me see I got this right.. I should boot the install cd.. mount my harddrive rm everything but /home.. then start gparted.. what do I do from here and what is the command for reinstall?
2008-02-09T15:30:00.000Z	orphean	ubuuntu	correct so far. then you would resize the partition that your /home is on just enough so you can fit /home onto another partition.
2008-02-09T15:31:00.000Z	orphean	ubuuntu	then you create that partition and copy /home over to it
2008-02-09T15:31:00.000Z	orphean	ubuuntu	then you run the installer as normal from the desktop and have it install onto the first partition.
2008-02-09T15:32:00.000Z	ubuuntu	orphean	what the heck.. I'll just buy an external harddrive I need the space anyways 500gb for ~$100 not bad. :)
2008-02-09T15:32:00.000Z	orphean	ubuuntu	haha that would be much simpler! I never said this was an optimal solution ;)
2008-02-09T15:32:00.000Z	ubuuntu	orphean	do you know if external hds with USB 2.0 is a piece of cake with ubuntu?
2008-02-09T15:33:00.000Z	orphean	ubuuntu	should be plug and play.
2008-02-09T15:33:00.000Z	ubuuntu	orphean	alright.. thanks!
