2005-12-16T13:02:00.000Z	sagarp		does anyone know why my apache2 wont let me change the /cgi-bin/ dir??
2005-12-16T13:04:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	sagarp	maybe it has something to do with apache using different files for different sites?
2005-12-16T13:05:00.000Z	sagarp	La_PaRCa	i dont have any vhosts, i just apt-get installed apache2 and libapache2-mod-perl2 but i want to change the location of cgi-bin, and the apache2.conf doesnt haev a SriptAlias directory
2005-12-16T13:05:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	sagarp	I know, but _IIRC_ apache puts the config in a separate file
2005-12-16T13:06:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	sagarp	I dont have apache2 installed right now so I cant be more specific
2005-12-16T13:06:00.000Z	sagarp	La_PaRCa	the only config file i'm aware of is apache2.conf..the other is httpd.conf but it's empty
2005-12-16T13:07:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	sagarp	let me connect my laptop to the power and ill try and see
2005-12-16T13:07:00.000Z	sagarp	La_PaRCa	thanks man i appreciate it
2005-12-16T13:08:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	sagarp	booting
2005-12-16T13:11:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	sagarp	/etcapache2sites-enabled
2005-12-16T13:11:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	sagarp	/etc/apache2/sites-enabled
2005-12-16T13:11:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	sagarp	000-default ScriptAlias is right there
2005-12-16T13:12:00.000Z	sagarp	La_PaRCa	wtf, amazing...i had no idea apache2 did that
2005-12-16T13:12:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	sagarp	got it?
2005-12-16T13:12:00.000Z	sagarp	La_PaRCa	thanks a lot..yeah i found it :D
2005-12-16T13:12:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	sagarp	I had never seen this setup before, I think its a debian thing
2005-12-16T13:13:00.000Z	sagarp	La_PaRCa	it must be because i used apache2 on slackware for my server and it all wen tin one file
2005-12-16T13:13:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	sagarp	I gotta admit this way is more practical
2005-12-16T13:13:00.000Z	sagarp	La_PaRCa	yeah it's a little strange though..is this the same as the vhosts thing?
2005-12-16T13:14:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	sagarp	and 000-default is just a catchall vhost
2005-12-16T13:19:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	sagarp	no, just chmod it
