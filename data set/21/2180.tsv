2011-11-21T03:50:00.000Z	reisio		you know what's really missing is a guide on how to use random software
2011-11-21T03:51:00.000Z	reisio		people don't realize you can just type 'theme' in a box :p
2011-11-21T03:51:00.000Z	reisio		indeed
2011-11-21T03:53:00.000Z	KWhat4	reisio	the problem is not that i dont know to type theme inot the serach box, the probem is i have 2000 results that are not themes
2011-11-21T03:54:00.000Z	reisio	KWhat4	for example?
2011-11-21T03:55:00.000Z	KWhat4	reisio	none of the themes listed in the chat show up,
2011-11-21T03:56:00.000Z	reisio	KWhat4	heh, k
2011-11-21T03:56:00.000Z	reisio	KWhat4	theme packages probably follow a naming convention
2011-11-21T03:56:00.000Z	reisio	KWhat4	foo-theme-bar, or the like
2011-11-21T03:56:00.000Z	reisio	KWhat4	they should be all grouped together
2011-11-21T03:57:00.000Z	reisio	KWhat4	you could get at them quicker from a terminal: apt-cache search theme | grep -i gnome, etc.
2011-11-21T03:57:00.000Z	KWhat4	reisio	there is something wrong with the serach, for example if i search for theme nothing shows up related to themes, if i search for adium then the audium-theme shows up
2011-11-21T04:00:00.000Z	reisio	KWhat4	maybe you're searching by description and not name
2011-11-21T04:00:00.000Z	reisio	KWhat4	or vice versa
2011-11-21T04:00:00.000Z	reisio	KWhat4	again apt-cache search in a terminal is going to be faster/easier to parse
2011-11-21T04:02:00.000Z	KWhat4	reisio	yes, for you and i, however for someone else thats not very good at the terminal, not its not.  I am just wondering why one the software center doesnt search pacakge names
2011-11-21T04:03:00.000Z	reisio	KWhat4	install synaptic
2011-11-21T04:03:00.000Z	reisio	KWhat4	software center is the super dumbed down version
2011-11-21T04:04:00.000Z	KWhat4	reisio	awesome!! thats just what i was looking for.  Thanks!
2011-11-21T04:05:00.000Z	reisio	KWhat4	:D
2011-11-21T04:06:00.000Z	reisio	KWhat4	sorry if you said software center earlier, should've realized
