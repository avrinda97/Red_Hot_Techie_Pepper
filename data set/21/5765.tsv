2007-11-02T09:26:00.000Z	cube		i have a new pc build and it makes the thinking sound when my hd activity light goes on! does it mean my sata hd is messed up??
2007-11-02T09:27:00.000Z	cube		the sound didn't happen right away when i installed ubuntu as a OS but now about a week later it happens when i open programs etc
2007-11-02T09:27:00.000Z	cube		its like the classic crappy computer thinking sound, but this thing is a beast why is it doing it?
2007-11-02T09:29:00.000Z	cube		for sure... it would be cool to know u had the option
2007-11-02T09:29:00.000Z	cube		anyone know why my computer is making the thinking sound?? would it be my hard drive?
2007-11-02T09:29:00.000Z	cube		it makes the sound when my hd activity light blinks
2007-11-02T09:31:00.000Z	cube		im not too happy that my new pc build is making the thinking sound...the same 1 that old pos pc's make
