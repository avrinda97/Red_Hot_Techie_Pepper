2006-08-13T10:54:00.000Z	sahasrara		i have a cd but it's corrupted i think... i checked and my edubuntu burn has an md5 log file, the kubuntu one doesn't and messes up on booting
2006-08-13T10:55:00.000Z	sahasrara		i don't know if the guy who downloaded the images for me still has them on his computer
2006-08-13T10:55:00.000Z	sahasrara		but i burned the cd's from ubuntu (k3b?) and i don't know why one had md5 checking and the other not
2006-08-13T10:56:00.000Z	sahasrara		how about AV for scanning my windows backup files?
2006-08-13T10:57:00.000Z	sahasrara		and if i have one ubuntu cd can't i just copy the thing from nero? the guy who let me burn from his pc said you can't just copy images
2006-08-13T10:57:00.000Z	sahasrara		i see, omnid... but i read linux can be affected by worms
2006-08-13T10:57:00.000Z	sahasrara		i was reading a little on emulators today
2006-08-13T10:58:00.000Z	sahasrara		didn't the first worm ever affect unix?
2006-08-13T10:59:00.000Z	sahasrara		lol evan
2006-08-13T10:59:00.000Z	sahasrara		i have a 2 year degree in windows programming.... all for what now that i will change to linux
2006-08-13T11:00:00.000Z	polpak	sahasrara	programming what language?
2006-08-13T11:00:00.000Z	sahasrara		commands are fun, actually ... if i know them, it's always fun to just let my finger rattle off a command
2006-08-13T11:00:00.000Z	sahasrara	polpak	vb6.... also took a little c and sql
2006-08-13T11:01:00.000Z	polpak	sahasrara	well the C and sql are still applicable
2006-08-13T11:01:00.000Z	sahasrara		so i guess i can go further with c and sql or learn c++ and do alright
2006-08-13T11:01:00.000Z	sahasrara		*nods*
2006-08-13T11:01:00.000Z	polpak	sahasrara	and vb is evil so it's good to be rid of it
2006-08-13T11:01:00.000Z	sahasrara		heh
2006-08-13T11:01:00.000Z	polpak	sahasrara	there's C# for linux, and there's also python (my fav)
2006-08-13T11:01:00.000Z	sahasrara		i remember how good it felt learning c
2006-08-13T11:02:00.000Z	polpak	sahasrara	plenty of good languages to use for development
