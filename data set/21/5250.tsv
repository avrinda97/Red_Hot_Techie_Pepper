2007-11-27T04:37:00.000Z	Aledon6		Which one?
2007-11-27T04:37:00.000Z	Aledon6		It's grub stuff. I'm trying to fix something (http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=624118)
2007-11-27T04:37:00.000Z	choudesh	Aledon6	those are just different version. I would suggest the latest version
2007-11-27T04:37:00.000Z	Aledon6		Are latest ones towards the bottom or top?
2007-11-27T04:38:00.000Z	choudesh	Aledon6	bottom. look @ the numbers
2007-11-27T04:38:00.000Z	Aledon6		k thanx
2007-11-27T04:38:00.000Z	Aledon6		i downloaded an iso
2007-11-27T04:39:00.000Z	Aledon6	choudesh	should I extract the iso before i put it onto the disk or not?
2007-11-27T04:39:00.000Z	choudesh	Aledon6	if you are going to use that ISO on your current machine - it would be easier just to mount the iso
2007-11-27T04:39:00.000Z	Aledon6		so just put the iso onto the disk choudesh?
2007-11-27T04:40:00.000Z	choudesh	Aledon6	no - you just mount the ISO as if it was already burned to a CD.
2007-11-27T04:40:00.000Z	Aledon6		um... okay?

2007-11-27T04:40:00.000Z	Aledon6	choudesh	I'm running from liveCD
2007-11-27T04:41:00.000Z	choudesh	Aledon6	O. Then I would suggest burning it to a CD. ;-)
2007-11-27T04:41:00.000Z	Aledon6	choudesh	What i need to do requires burning it to CD and then restarting the computer
