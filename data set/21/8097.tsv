2007-04-11T12:42:00.000Z	Pelo	ProN00b	do a search in synaptic for yacc and see what comes up
2007-04-11T12:42:00.000Z	ProN00b	Pelo	quite some stuff
2007-04-11T12:42:00.000Z	Pelo	ProN00b	 sounds like you have some reading to do
2007-06-30T06:21:00.000Z	Pelo	ProN00b	yes but it won'T be mounted unless you add it to fstab
2007-06-30T06:23:00.000Z	ProN00b	Pelo	thats what i wanted to know
2007-06-30T06:23:00.000Z	ProN00b	Pelo	when i installed ubuntu fstab was autogenerated, how do i have it update
2007-06-30T06:24:00.000Z	Pelo	ProN00b	you need to edit it manualy,   gksu  gedit /etc/fstab
2007-06-30T06:24:00.000Z	ProN00b	Pelo	there must be a gui way to do it
2007-06-30T06:24:00.000Z	Pelo	ProN00b	just copy one of the other lines,  and make appropriate modifications
2007-06-30T06:24:00.000Z	Pelo	ProN00b	nope that 's how you do it
2007-06-30T06:25:00.000Z	Pelo	ProN00b	try windows then
2007-06-30T06:26:00.000Z	Pelo	ProN00b	technicaly, this is gui,   cli is something else
2007-06-30T06:26:00.000Z	ProN00b	Pelo	do i need to create a folder in /media ?
2007-06-30T06:27:00.000Z	Pelo	ProN00b	 there or eslewhere,  but yes,  you need to create a mount point    sudo mkdir /path/of/your/choice     ,  in /mnt or in /media ,   /media will dislpay the folder on your desktop
2007-06-30T06:28:00.000Z	ProN00b	Pelo	i just resized a partition and even tho it mounts correctly to /media it doesn#t appear on the desktop anymore
2007-06-30T06:29:00.000Z	Pelo	ProN00b	 you will need to restart X
2007-06-30T06:29:00.000Z	Pelo	ProN00b	 and you donT' mount to /media,  you mount to a dir inside /media like  /media/folder
2007-06-30T06:29:00.000Z	ProN00b	Pelo	ya, i didn't specify a dir at all actually
2007-06-30T06:30:00.000Z	Pelo	ProN00b	 if you donT' specify a dir it won't get mounted at all
2007-06-30T06:30:00.000Z	ProN00b	Pelo	it does, to default mount location in /media
