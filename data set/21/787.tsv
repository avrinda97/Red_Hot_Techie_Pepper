2011-06-11T13:50:00.000Z	\sda		hi all, question! I would like have a faster standby on my pc, Now I need 15sec to stop and 15sec to start! Almost the time I need to boot! What can I do?
2011-06-11T13:51:00.000Z	rly	\sda	what kind of standby?
2011-06-11T13:53:00.000Z	\sda	rly	like close my monitor and save energy, but my pc still on and recover fast!
2011-06-11T13:53:00.000Z	\sda	rly	Like mac's pc
2011-06-11T13:54:00.000Z	rly	\sda	you can also just press the powerbutton on your monitor.
2011-06-11T13:54:00.000Z	rly	\sda	I have no idea what exactly macs do.
2011-06-11T13:54:00.000Z	rly	\sda	anyway, there is hibernation and pause.
2011-06-11T13:55:00.000Z	rly	\sda	hibernation requires zero power when off and is slower to start, but faster than full boot.
2011-06-11T13:55:00.000Z	\sda	rly	on my ubuntu i have hibernate and suspend, so I think i'm talking about pause
2011-06-11T13:55:00.000Z	rly	\sda	pause requires some power, but is very fast.
2011-06-11T13:55:00.000Z	rly	\sda	on my two year old laptop is is about 5 seconds or so.
2011-06-11T13:55:00.000Z	rly		it is*
2011-06-11T13:56:00.000Z	\sda	rly	on my new pc, 15 to go down, 15to go up
2011-06-11T13:56:00.000Z	rly	\sda	shutting down takes 3 seconds on my system currently.
2011-06-11T13:56:00.000Z	rly	\sda	but that's not pause.
2011-06-11T13:56:00.000Z	rly	\sda	do you have 8GB?
2011-06-11T13:56:00.000Z	rly	\sda	of RAM.
2011-06-11T13:56:00.000Z	\sda	rly	yep
2011-06-11T13:57:00.000Z	rly	\sda	I don't think that should matter for pause/suspend.
2011-06-11T13:57:00.000Z	\sda	rly	vish, Amdx6 8gb
2011-06-11T13:57:00.000Z	rly	\sda	only for hibernation.
