2007-02-17T11:56:00.000Z	arrenlex	imsocute	In your command, instead of using "xserver-xorg-driver-ati", use "xserver-xorg-video-ati".
2007-02-17T11:56:00.000Z	arrenlex	imsocute	Also, if you're new, why are you trying to build source packages?
2007-02-17T11:56:00.000Z	imsocute	arrenlex	i want beryl to work with this
2007-02-17T11:57:00.000Z	arrenlex	imsocute	And it doesn't currently?

2007-02-17T12:00:00.000Z	arrenlex	imsocute	I don't know. I would follow the ubuntu instructions.
