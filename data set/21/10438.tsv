2005-05-05T09:52:00.000Z	Chipzz		*sigh*
2005-05-05T09:52:00.000Z	Chipzz		is there any way to get your mousecursor back in X after a fullscreen app crashes?
2005-05-05T09:53:00.000Z	Chipzz		this is really getting on my nerves having to kill X each time that app crashes
2005-05-05T09:54:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Chipzz	what app is that ?
2005-05-05T09:54:00.000Z	Chipzz	LinuxJones	in this case, mupen64, but other apps that run full screen and change the cursor will do that too
2005-05-05T09:54:00.000Z	Chipzz	LinuxJones	SDL apps causing at the wrong moment for instance
2005-05-05T09:56:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Chipzz	wish I could help :(  night all
2005-08-27T05:32:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Chipzz	what problems are you having ?
2005-08-27T05:32:00.000Z	Chipzz	LinuxJones	trying to figure out which package generates a file
2005-08-27T05:33:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Chipzz	generates what file ?
2005-08-27T05:35:00.000Z	Chipzz	LinuxJones	/boot/grub/splash.xpm.gz
2005-08-27T05:36:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Chipzz	that's just a grub theme file isn't it ?
2005-08-27T05:36:00.000Z	Chipzz	LinuxJones	yes
2005-08-27T05:37:00.000Z	Chipzz	LinuxJones	(I think so)
2005-08-27T05:37:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Chipzz	they can get installed under gdmsetup (graphical greeter)
2005-08-27T05:37:00.000Z	Chipzz	LinuxJones	apparently it's placed there by new installs, but I have been on hoary before it was released and upgraded my way to current breezy; and since it is apparently generated on install, I do not have it :/
2005-08-27T05:40:00.000Z	Chipzz	LinuxJones	just ran sudo gdmsetup, choose a different theme, closed. ran sudo gdmsetup again, changed back, no luck :/
2005-08-27T05:40:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Chipzz	that's breezy for you :)
2005-08-27T05:41:00.000Z	Chipzz	LinuxJones	*hrmpf* :)
2005-08-27T05:45:00.000Z	Chipzz	LinuxJones	thx for the effort anyway :)
2005-08-27T05:45:00.000Z	LinuxJones	Chipzz	good luck
