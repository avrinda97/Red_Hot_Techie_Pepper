2012-11-14T22:34:00.000Z	Calinou		this also happens on the live USB of xubuntu and lubuntu. i bet it will happen with any linux distro
2012-11-14T22:34:00.000Z	Calinou		this seems to be related to graphics
2012-11-14T22:35:00.000Z	Calinou		whenever I'm running a 3D app with high FPS the sound is high pitched. lower FPS = lower pitched, more chainsaw-like
2012-11-14T22:35:00.000Z	Calinou		(both nouveau and nvidia driver do that)
2012-11-14T22:36:00.000Z	tsaavik	Calinou	if you unplug the headphones and speakers, do you still hear it?
2012-11-14T22:39:00.000Z	Calinou		yes
2012-11-14T22:39:00.000Z	Calinou		the computer itself plays the sound..
2012-11-14T22:40:00.000Z	tsaavik		have you tried momentarily stopping the fan on the video card
2012-11-14T22:40:00.000Z	Calinou	tsaavik	it's not the GPU fan...
2012-11-14T22:40:00.000Z	Calinou		definitely not
2012-11-14T22:40:00.000Z	tsaavik		Okay, then I think i know exactly what your talking about
2012-11-14T22:41:00.000Z	tsaavik		some people are able to hear the pwm through an inductor when the varnish on the inductor has started to fail. This could be an indicator of other issues (why did the varnish fail, did it overheat)
2012-11-14T22:42:00.000Z	tsaavik	Calinou	hunt around and see if you can pin the noise to your powersupply (likely culprit), otherwise you might be looking at a slowly dieing videocard :(
2012-11-14T22:42:00.000Z	Calinou	tsaavik	this issue happens since always (my computer is 9 months old)
2012-11-14T22:42:00.000Z	tsaavik		it can, whenever i hear it i return the item
2012-11-14T22:42:00.000Z	Calinou		maybe i should try to plug stuff again, yes
2012-11-14T22:42:00.000Z	Calinou		i'll look into it later
2012-11-14T22:43:00.000Z	tsaavik		I had a brand new samsung that I took back, I could hear it hum when i set the brightness to anoything below 80 :D
2012-11-14T22:43:00.000Z	tsaavik		prime95 on windows is usally my go-to powersupply torture test
2012-11-14T22:44:00.000Z	tsaavik	Calinou	looks like there is a prime95 for linux, try that out in torture test mode, the one that stresses powersupply
