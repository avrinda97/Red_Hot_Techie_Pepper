2008-04-13T09:12:00.000Z	illDecree_		anyone wanna help out a NON-asshole?
2008-04-13T09:13:00.000Z	illDecree_		haha
2008-04-13T09:15:00.000Z	illDecree_		alright, im a complete noob, that really wants to switch, have read every doc, but cannot seem to figure out simple stuff. i just freshly installed kubuntu 7.04.  i need to get my graphics, wifi, and dial up modem working, but cannot figure out any after a week of research. im wanting to start w/the graphics, but have no idea where to really begin
2008-04-13T09:16:00.000Z	nickrud	illDecree_	what video card? I'll take a shot at that
2008-04-13T09:17:00.000Z	nickrud	illDecree_	ok, open a terminal (apps->acces->terminal,  and type   gksudo restricted-manager   , you should get a window
2008-04-13T10:24:00.000Z	nickrud	illDecree_	lspci | grep -i vga will tell you your graphics card/chip
2008-04-13T10:24:00.000Z	illDecree_	nickrud	i tried that.... it doesn't seem to come up.... not sure why
2008-04-13T10:25:00.000Z	nickrud	illDecree_	are you sure you're typing it correctly? try copy and paste ->    lspci | grep -i vga    <--
2008-04-13T10:26:00.000Z	nickrud	illDecree_	so, what was it?
2008-04-13T10:26:00.000Z	illDecree_	nickrud	honestly, im a noob, and am having one hell of a time getting the graphics working...
2008-04-13T10:27:00.000Z	nickrud	illDecree_	are you getting any graphics? And it's really hard to give advice without info ... oh, that piece of ...
2008-04-13T10:28:00.000Z	nickrud	illDecree_	does it have a chip type listed in that vga line?
2008-04-13T10:30:00.000Z	nickrud	illDecree_	ok, I think you need the xserver-xorg-video-unichrome  package. And it's only available from the net
2008-04-13T10:31:00.000Z	illDecree_	nickrud	 thats the prob... i have no net connection... the modem isn't installed either, niether is the wifi... and the 10/100 is broken
2008-04-13T10:31:00.000Z	nickrud	illDecree_	or it may be the xserver-xorg-video-via
2008-04-13T10:32:00.000Z	nickrud	illDecree_	then you need to concentrate on wifi. And I"m pretty clueless about wireless. What does    lspci | grep -i wlan  say?
2008-04-13T10:36:00.000Z	nickrud	illDecree_	yeah, it's gonna be hard to get that running without the 10/100 working. Thats how I set up my laptop wireless, bootstrap with wired
2008-04-13T10:38:00.000Z	nickrud	illDecree_	no, wired is simple, nearly every card driver is already in the kernel
2008-04-13T10:40:00.000Z	nickrud	illDecree_	oh, pccard. hm. Nothing like trying :)
2008-04-13T10:41:00.000Z	nickrud	illDecree_	but you're gonna run into similar issues with any ubuntu install, wireless anyway
2008-04-13T10:41:00.000Z	nickrud	illDecree_	and especially with that one since you need to get the firmware for it from somewhere, probably the net
