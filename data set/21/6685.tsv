2011-05-18T09:34:00.000Z	Diana		you boot from the usb stick with ubuntu?
2011-05-18T09:35:00.000Z	Diana		maybe it's a Macbook Air issue then...
2011-05-18T09:35:00.000Z	Diana		didn't try refit
2011-05-18T09:36:00.000Z	Diana		no such option vaxinated, in macs it's different
2011-05-18T09:36:00.000Z	Diana		it has a boot loader vaxinated
2011-05-18T09:37:00.000Z	Diana		it only shows my ssd hd on the bootloader
2011-05-18T09:37:00.000Z	Diana		it should
2011-05-18T09:38:00.000Z	Diana		damn
2011-05-18T09:39:00.000Z	Diana		would ubuntu run nice on virtualbox then?
2011-05-18T09:40:00.000Z	Diana		no cd drive, but would it work from the downloaded iso?
2011-05-18T09:41:00.000Z	rob_p	Diana	Have you considered vmware-fusion?  I run both Windows XP Pro and Ubuntu in virtual machines on my Mac with it.  Performance is superb and it works very well, although fusion is not free!
2011-05-18T09:42:00.000Z	Diana		nope vaxinated
2011-05-18T09:42:00.000Z	Diana	rob_p	you know if virtualbox would work too?
2011-05-18T09:42:00.000Z	Diana		needed a free lightweight solution, that's why I thought liveUSB
2011-05-18T09:42:00.000Z	Diana		MacBook Air
2011-05-18T09:42:00.000Z	rob_p	Diana	Actually, I'm in my virtualized Ubuntu right now as I type this! :)
2011-05-18T09:43:00.000Z	rob_p	Diana	I don't know if virtualbox has a version for mac.
2011-05-18T09:43:00.000Z	Diana		http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.0.8/VirtualBox-4.0.8-71778-OSX.dmg
2011-05-18T09:43:00.000Z	Diana		seems like so
2011-05-18T09:43:00.000Z	rob_p	Diana	Looks like it! :)
2011-05-18T09:44:00.000Z	rob_p	Diana	Give it a go and see.
