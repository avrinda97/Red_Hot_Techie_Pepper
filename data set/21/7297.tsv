2006-11-07T17:40:00.000Z	E_Presly		My ubuntu (edgy) stops during boot. It say it cant mount root and then say something about initramfs? Can someone point me in some direction?
2006-11-07T17:40:00.000Z	E_Presly		I should add that it was almost a fresh install and I am running dualboot with XP
2006-11-07T06:28:00.000Z	E_Presly		I have dualboot, XP and Edgy. I installed Edgy today and it worked great until I rebboted into windows and then back to edgy. I get "/bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off". Does windows alter my boot partition?
2006-11-07T06:30:00.000Z	sethk	E_Presly	installing xp, or just booting it?
2006-11-07T06:31:00.000Z	E_Presly	sethk	just booting it.
2006-11-07T06:31:00.000Z	sethk	E_Presly	that's quite odd.
2006-11-07T06:32:00.000Z	sethk	E_Presly	no, I doubt that's at all relevant
2006-11-07T06:32:00.000Z	sethk	E_Presly	what happens when you boot?  do you get the grub menu?
2006-11-07T06:33:00.000Z	E_Presly	sethk	Yes I get the Grub and I can select ubuntu or win
2006-11-07T06:33:00.000Z	sethk	E_Presly	ok, and what happens when you select linux?
2006-11-07T06:34:00.000Z	E_Presly	sethk	mzli: right after ubuntu splash: "/bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off"
2006-11-07T06:35:00.000Z	sethk	E_Presly	hmm, sounds like your /dev directory might be screwed up.  or part of the kernel.
2006-11-07T06:36:00.000Z	sethk	E_Presly	most likely you can boot a live cd and fix it, but it would take some time to figure out exactly what to fix.
2006-11-07T06:36:00.000Z	E_Presly	sethk	yes Im finding something about this in the forums, Im not at that computer atm but Im gonna try it tomorrow.
2006-11-07T06:36:00.000Z	sethk	E_Presly	ok.  we can't really be very specific, there are too many possibilities
2006-11-07T06:37:00.000Z	E_Presly	sethk	yes but I hope that I only have to modify the grub list
2006-11-07T06:37:00.000Z	sethk	E_Presly	unlikely, unless you somehow changed it.  I assume you mean the grub config file, which is menu.lst
2006-11-07T06:38:00.000Z	sethk	E_Presly	of course, something unlikely did happen, but it's pretty hard to change your menu.lst file accidentally without clobbering it entirely.
2006-11-07T06:38:00.000Z	E_Presly	sethk	Yes but I saw that on the forums that it happend to some people. One of them even after booting windows on a dualboot...
2006-11-07T06:39:00.000Z	sethk	E_Presly	ok, still seems unlikely, but we'll see what happens.
2006-11-07T06:39:00.000Z	sethk	E_Presly	it's easy to get confused about whether something is really caused by booting another o/s.  It almost never really is.
