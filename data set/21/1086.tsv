2011-02-08T03:14:00.000Z	schnuffle	Vustom	looks like your CD is corrupted
2011-08-02T19:21:00.000Z	schnuffle	Vustom	HAve you tried FireFox and set the socks5 proxy?
2011-08-02T19:22:00.000Z	schnuffle	Vustom	And did you run the proy script as normal user?
2011-08-02T19:23:00.000Z	Vustom	schnuffle	Nope, but I'd rather not use Firefox though, but I did use it yesterday for something else while being connected to the proxy and the improvement in speed went up and there was no connection drops.. so many it's the system's proxy that has the problem?
2011-08-02T19:23:00.000Z	Vustom	schnuffle	Normal use, just double-clicked.
2011-08-02T19:25:00.000Z	schnuffle	Vustom	chrome doesn't uses the global configuration. Make sure that you select manual proxy config and that you empty any fields but the Socks-Host
2011-08-02T19:26:00.000Z	Vustom	schnuffle	That's how I already have it.
2011-08-02T19:26:00.000Z	schnuffle	Vustom	Per default HTTP-Proxy is set with localhost for http
2011-08-02T19:26:00.000Z	Vustom	schnuffle	Huh?
2011-08-02T19:26:00.000Z	Vustom	schnuffle	You've lost me. :p
2011-08-02T19:28:00.000Z	schnuffle	Vustom	Okay, when you go to the connection settings you can choose the manual proxy config option, Then you can set  proxy adresses for HTTP,SSL,FTP and SOCKS-Host. Make sure that the HTTP-Proxy field is empty
2011-08-02T19:29:00.000Z	Vustom	schnuffle	All are empty besides Socks host: which has localhost then 42280 for the Port:
2011-08-02T19:31:00.000Z	schnuffle	Vustom	Hmm, can test it right now, I'm only sure it worked for me in Firefox
2011-08-02T19:32:00.000Z	Vustom	schnuffle	I hope I can get this fixed, I dread using Ubuntu now because I can't use my Proxy. D:
