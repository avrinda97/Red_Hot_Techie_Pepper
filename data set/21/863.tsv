2012-04-05T00:28:00.000Z	ikonia	OneSquared	why do you want to compile subversion
2012-04-05T00:28:00.000Z	ikonia	OneSquared	subversion is in the repo
2012-04-05T00:28:00.000Z	ikonia	OneSquared	why ? apt-get install will give you working packages
2012-04-05T00:29:00.000Z	ikonia	OneSquared	compiling software in a safe manner is a.) unrequired b.) dangerous to your systems stability
2012-04-05T00:29:00.000Z	OneSquared	ikonia	My system is in virtual machine.
2012-04-05T00:29:00.000Z	ikonia	OneSquared	that doesn't change anything
2012-04-05T00:31:00.000Z	ikonia	OneSquared	 you shouldn't compile it
2012-04-05T00:31:00.000Z	ikonia	OneSquared	 it is in the ubuntu repo's, install it from there
2012-04-05T00:32:00.000Z	OneSquared	ikonia	Yes I know. But for learn, I want not use apt-get install. So i must compile.
2012-04-05T00:32:00.000Z	ikonia	OneSquared	no - you don't
2012-04-05T00:33:00.000Z	ikonia	OneSquared	svn is a bad place to learn
