2009-07-29T15:12:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	MerlinW	Yes, wubi sux, but it's better a dualboot computer than a windows-only computer, dont you think? =D
2009-07-29T15:13:00.000Z	MerlinW	Beyecixramd	ur my man:D
2009-07-29T15:13:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	MerlinW	Arch Linux here only =3
2009-07-29T15:14:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	MerlinW	no VM here =D in fact, Fedora + Arch Linux on dual boot
2009-07-29T15:15:00.000Z	MerlinW	Beyecixramd	, i need a win for some works unfortunattly :(
2009-07-29T15:16:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	MerlinW	aaah, sad. I promised not to touch Windows never again =3
2009-07-29T15:16:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	MerlinW	maybe someday we will be really free, not depending on windows ~
2009-07-29T15:17:00.000Z	MerlinW	Beyecixramd	i have a imac too instead "win" :D
2009-07-29T15:17:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	MerlinW	i don't like apple, in fact i hate apple.
2009-07-29T15:17:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	MerlinW	but i hate more Microsoft than Apple.
2009-07-29T15:17:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	MerlinW	Anything else is better than Windows, even FreeFOS xD
2009-07-29T15:18:00.000Z	MerlinW	Beyecixramd	osx is good...
2009-07-29T15:21:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	MerlinW	Network? you mean internet?
2009-07-29T15:21:00.000Z	MerlinW	Beyecixramd	no, i mean local network, but if he has fast connection...:D
2009-07-29T15:21:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	MerlinW	LAN then. Only possible if you have more than 1 PC =D.
2009-07-29T15:23:00.000Z	MerlinW	Beyecixramd	LAN is a network too, right?:D
2009-07-29T15:24:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	MerlinW	in fact, LAN is only network, and internet is called WAN xD i thought you meant WAN instead of LAN (like uploading your data to a hosting service provider)
2009-07-29T15:24:00.000Z	MerlinW	Beyecixramd	concentrate to the "N" word:D
2009-07-29T15:25:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	MerlinW	OH NO! the "N" word D= xD
