2007-01-23T10:23:00.000Z	mwe		renaming /home is sufficient if you don't reformat
2007-01-23T10:24:00.000Z	mwe		then remove the rest from a live cd
2007-01-23T10:24:00.000Z	Anton99	mwe	i cannot install kubuntu 6.10 without formatting :(
2007-01-23T10:24:00.000Z	mwe	Anton99	why not
2007-01-23T10:25:00.000Z	Anton99	mwe	installer crashes :(
2007-01-23T10:25:00.000Z	mwe	Anton99	then reformatting probably wont help
2007-01-23T10:25:00.000Z	mwe	Anton99	maybe try the alternate CD instead
2007-01-23T10:31:00.000Z	mwe	Anton99	installing any of the -desktop packages intalls Xorg as well
2007-01-23T10:31:00.000Z	Anton99	mwe	??? i cannot run startx (writes bash: command startx not found)
2007-01-23T10:32:00.000Z	mwe	Anton99	It sounds like you didn't succesfully install a desktop environment if startx is not available. usually it will install a graphical login manager as well
2007-01-23T10:34:00.000Z	Anton99	mwe	sudo apt-get ubuntu-desktop kubuntu-desktop xubuntu-desktop?
2007-01-23T10:34:00.000Z	mwe	Anton99	no
2007-01-23T10:34:00.000Z	Anton99	mwe	why?
2007-01-23T10:34:00.000Z	mwe	Anton99	how did you install ubuntu
2007-01-23T10:34:00.000Z	Anton99	mwe	from alternate ced
2007-01-23T10:34:00.000Z	mwe	Anton99	because it's apt-get install package.
2007-01-23T10:34:00.000Z	mwe	Anton99	why would you install all three, though?
2007-01-23T10:34:00.000Z	Anton99	mwe	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop kubuntu-desktop xubuntu-desktop? i need KDE, GNOME & Xfce
2007-01-23T10:35:00.000Z	mwe	Anton99	in that case, yes
2007-01-23T10:35:00.000Z	Anton99	mwe	and i have 500 GB large disk
2007-01-23T10:35:00.000Z	mwe	Anton99	go ahead then
