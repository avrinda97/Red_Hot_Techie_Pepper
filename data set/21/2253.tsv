2009-12-02T21:40:00.000Z	tobiasz		how do I get Audacity to work in Karmic?
2009-12-02T21:41:00.000Z	BlueEagle	tobiasz	sudo aptitude install audacity && audacity
2009-12-02T21:41:00.000Z	BlueEagle	tobiasz	Doesn't that do it?
2009-12-02T21:42:00.000Z	tobiasz	BlueEagle	you don't use Audacity in 9.10 I see, because it doesn't work, my sound card is SB Live!
2009-12-02T21:42:00.000Z	BlueEagle	tobiasz	In what way does it not work?
2009-12-02T21:43:00.000Z	tobiasz	BlueEagle	it doesn't record at all, just records silence
2009-12-02T21:43:00.000Z	BlueEagle	tobiasz	Does other applications record sound?
2009-12-02T21:43:00.000Z	BlueEagle	tobiasz	I am guessing that the problem is not with audacity but the way your sound is set up.
2009-12-02T21:44:00.000Z	tobiasz	BlueEagle	9.10 Ubuntu Karmic regular,
2009-12-02T21:45:00.000Z	BlueEagle	tobiasz	Sound in linux is not quite like sound in windows. First you have two different sound systems in the kernel. The old and obsolete OSS and the new and better ALSA. I am not sure which sound server Ubuntu runs by default (if any) but what I would try first is alsamixer
2009-12-02T21:46:00.000Z	BlueEagle	tobiasz	`man alsamixer` for instruction on usage. You want the record page and check that your mic is not muted (which it usually is iirc)
2009-12-02T21:46:00.000Z	tobiasz	BlueEagle	it does record in the default sound registrator
2009-12-02T21:46:00.000Z	tobiasz	BlueEagle	after I've setup pavucontrol to record "monitor of SB Live!"
2009-12-02T21:47:00.000Z	tobiasz	BlueEagle	why can't I set it up via regular system tray manager
2009-12-02T21:48:00.000Z	tobiasz	BlueEagle	I mean switching mic/what you hear
2009-12-02T21:48:00.000Z	tobiasz	BlueEagle	this is currently the biggest flaw in Ubuntu and needs to be fixed
2009-12-02T21:49:00.000Z	BlueEagle	tobiasz	Well if you are able to record in other applications I would assume it is a setting in audacity. Make sure that it points to the correct sound source.
2009-12-02T21:51:00.000Z	tobiasz	BlueEagle	the command you mentioned returns:  0 snd_emu10k1
2009-12-02T21:55:00.000Z	BlueEagle	tobiasz	I think that is an optional channel.
2009-12-02T21:55:00.000Z	BlueEagle	tobiasz	Not sure about that one tho.
2009-12-02T21:55:00.000Z	BlueEagle	tobiasz	If you use alsamixer (did it just return one line and no control panel?) then you should find it.
