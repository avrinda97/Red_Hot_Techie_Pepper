2009-01-23T17:19:00.000Z	smokie		how can i make my shell script download something to the directory i use the command in?
2009-01-23T17:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	smokie	its alredy exists, use wget
2009-01-23T17:20:00.000Z	smokie	ActionParsnip	ah, so if i used wget "ftp.eggheads.org" for example then contine to tar -zxvf eggdropx.x.tar and it will untar it in the directly i used the bash script in?
2009-01-23T17:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	smokie	no you'd need to specify the full path to the file, and you dont need quotes
2009-01-23T17:21:00.000Z	smokie	ActionParsnip	do you mine giving me an example? like how would i make it untar to the path the user im using?
2009-01-23T17:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	smokie	you could write the script that wiil take a file path to get, and extract it automatically if you want
2009-01-23T17:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	smokie	if you put the script in /usr/bin it will always work in the current pwd
2009-01-23T17:22:00.000Z	smokie	ActionParsnip	thats exactly what i want to do actually..
2009-01-23T17:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	smokie	it will execute in the working directory
2009-01-23T17:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	smokie	so if you are in a subfolder of ~/ it will work there
2009-01-23T17:24:00.000Z	smokie	ActionParsnip	cool thanks for the info
2009-01-23T17:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	smokie	just use $1 in the script
2009-01-23T17:25:00.000Z	smokie	ActionParsnip	what does that supposed to do?
2009-01-23T17:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	smokie	takes the first arguement, it'll let you use the script more often
2009-01-23T17:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	smokie	i think you can use \n in some way
2009-01-23T17:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	smokie	http://www.ss64.com/bash/echo.html
2009-01-23T17:45:00.000Z	smokie	ActionParsnip	i think a wrote a premative install-egg bash script, just one last thing before i test it, it doesnt have to End with anything, right?
2009-01-23T17:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	smokie	nope, just stop typing :)
2009-01-23T17:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	smokie	remember to chmod +x the script too so its executable
2009-01-23T17:46:00.000Z	smokie	ActionParsnip	coool and it should m chmod to 555, right?
2009-01-23T17:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	smokie	remember to have #!/bin/bash as the first line too
