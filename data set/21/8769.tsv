2006-01-14T15:15:00.000Z	gee_gee		hi all
2006-01-14T15:16:00.000Z	gee_gee		i have a certain problem with my current version of ubuntu (dapper drake)
2006-01-14T15:16:00.000Z	gee_gee		it wont boot anymore because there are some syntax errors in /etc/init.d/rc
2006-01-14T15:16:00.000Z	davey	gee_gee	insert a livecd and mount it and edit it
2006-01-14T15:16:00.000Z	gee_gee		i didnt modify it :(
2006-01-14T15:16:00.000Z	gee_gee		yep thats my prob... dont have a live cd...
2006-01-14T15:17:00.000Z	davey	gee_gee	time to download one... :)
2006-01-14T15:17:00.000Z	davey		I can mail you one, but it'll take about a week to .de (which is where I think you are - if not, oh well)
2006-01-14T15:17:00.000Z	gee_gee		hmmm.... would take ages. isnt there another possible way?
2006-01-14T15:18:00.000Z	gee_gee		argh...
2006-01-14T15:18:00.000Z	davey	gee_gee	what filesystem do you use?
2006-01-14T15:18:00.000Z	gee_gee		ext3
2006-01-14T15:18:00.000Z	davey	gee_gee	OK, you are in windows, right?
2006-01-14T15:18:00.000Z	gee_gee		(and i know how to fix it, the problem is to access the disk)
2006-01-14T15:18:00.000Z	gee_gee		yup
2006-01-14T15:19:00.000Z	davey		OK, gee_gee, google for one of the ext2/3 filesystem drivers, then you *might* be able to at least move the file out of the init.d directory so it can boot
2006-01-14T15:19:00.000Z	gee_gee		hm... sounds good. didnt get that idea. ill try that out.
2006-01-14T15:20:00.000Z	davey		http://www.fs-driver.org/ <--- try that one gee_gee
2006-01-14T15:20:00.000Z	gee_gee	davey	thx... ill have a look.
2006-01-14T15:24:00.000Z	gee_gee	davey	it works fine. thank you very much!
2006-01-14T15:24:00.000Z	davey	gee_gee	it does work? cool, Will have to try it out
