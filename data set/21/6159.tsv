2007-05-31T16:50:00.000Z	verb3k_	ph8	does it log system messages ?
2007-05-31T16:50:00.000Z	ph8		i don't see you doing any helping
2007-05-31T16:50:00.000Z	ph8	verb3k_	just the commands you've run i believe
2007-05-31T16:50:00.000Z	verb3k_	ph8	is there a file for the messages ?
2007-05-31T16:52:00.000Z	ph8	verb3k_	i'm not sure what you mean by messages, you mean the output of run commands?
2007-05-31T16:52:00.000Z	verb3k_	ph8	 exactly
2007-05-31T16:56:00.000Z	verb3k_	ph8	 it's very important to know what happened to your system when you are away from it ...especially if you found your systemshutdown by itself ....just like the blackbox of a plane :)
2007-05-31T16:57:00.000Z	ph8	verb3k_	you might want to check dmesg?
2007-05-31T16:57:00.000Z	ph8		/var/log/messages
2007-05-31T16:57:00.000Z	ph8		etc
2007-05-31T16:58:00.000Z	verb3k_	ph8	 thanks ...I will do
