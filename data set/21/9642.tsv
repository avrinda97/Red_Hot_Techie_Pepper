2005-08-12T06:59:00.000Z	Stormx	jrattner1	You're bound to get errors. Did you paste everything correctly, without the numbers? Errors is normal, Seveas tells me.
2005-08-12T07:00:00.000Z	jrattner1	Stormx	yes i pasted it without the numbers and its there correctly
2005-08-12T07:00:00.000Z	Stormx	jrattner1	When you open it, close the box with errors, do you get packages?
2005-08-12T07:01:00.000Z	jrattner1	Stormx	the next dialogue is a popup saying my package informationg is out of date
2005-08-12T07:01:00.000Z	Stormx	jrattner1	So update it.
