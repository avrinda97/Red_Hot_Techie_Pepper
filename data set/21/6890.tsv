2007-01-07T12:51:00.000Z	joerlend	hjmills	that's not true. It's very easy to replace mbr in windows. fdisk /mbr
2007-01-07T12:51:00.000Z	hjmills	joerlend	that works! wow - why didnt somebody tell me that - does that work with the linux fdisk or just the windows fdisk?
2007-01-07T13:22:00.000Z	hjmills	joerlend	& fred1: thats why there is kubuntu
2007-01-07T13:44:00.000Z	hjmills	joerlend	i want to say page up but i dont know for sure
2007-01-07T13:44:00.000Z	joerlend	hjmills	that doesn't do it.
2007-01-07T13:44:00.000Z	hjmills	joerlend	sorry - bin a while since i used it
2007-01-07T13:44:00.000Z	hjmills	joerlend	check the man page?
2007-01-07T13:45:00.000Z	joerlend	hjmills	sorry.. :) _now_ it suddenly works. I tried it earlier, but then I only got the bash history
2007-01-07T13:45:00.000Z	hjmills	joerlend	oh well - if it works then dont complain!
2007-01-07T13:46:00.000Z	joerlend	hjmills	try bitlbee for msn
2007-01-07T13:46:00.000Z	joerlend	hjmills	im.bitlbee.org
2007-01-07T13:46:00.000Z	hjmills	joerlend	thanks
2007-01-07T13:46:00.000Z	joerlend	hjmills	just connect to it as if it's an IRC server and you'll get help once you're logged in.
2007-01-07T13:57:00.000Z	hjmills	joerlend	i hope so - i told him about it enough!
2007-01-07T13:58:00.000Z	joerlend	hjmills	I noticed. That's why I'm asking. It's abit strange that he's still asking.
2007-01-07T13:58:00.000Z	hjmills	joerlend	i told you about that restricted formats web page over half an hour ago - that would have had you up and running within about 10 minutes max
2007-01-07T13:59:00.000Z	joerlend	hjmills	me? :)
2007-01-07T13:59:00.000Z	hjmills	joerlend	oops - my bad - sorry and thanks for telling me
