2010-04-04T13:22:00.000Z	sapphireprayer		 I am using a horrible TSSTcorp Combo CD. Under Gentoo with HAL, I set a HAL fdi file to stop autodetect of the CD device. However it does not work under Ubuntu 9.10, while my system pauses from time to time.
2010-04-04T13:23:00.000Z	sapphireprayer		http://paste.ubuntu.com/408965/ Here is my FDI file, how to make an equivalent settings in Ubuntu 9.10? Thank you.
2010-04-04T13:24:00.000Z	moetunes	sapphireprayer	is it listed in /etc/fstab?
2010-04-04T13:28:00.000Z	sapphireprayer	moetunes	no

2010-04-04T13:28:00.000Z	moetunes	sapphireprayer	what about in /etc/mtab?
2010-04-04T13:29:00.000Z	sapphireprayer	moetunes	sorry.
2010-04-04T13:29:00.000Z	sapphireprayer	moetunes	it has.
2010-04-04T13:29:00.000Z	sapphireprayer	moetunes	is it the one you mena?
2010-04-04T13:30:00.000Z	moetunes	sapphireprayer	you need to comment that line out and it won't get mounted at boot
2010-04-04T13:30:00.000Z	sapphireprayer	moetunes	well, in fact, there is no disc in my cdrom.
2010-04-04T13:31:00.000Z	sapphireprayer	moetunes	And the system stops from time to time.
2010-04-04T13:32:00.000Z	moetunes	sapphireprayer	I thought you didn't want the cd drive to automatically be mounted?
2010-04-04T13:32:00.000Z	sapphireprayer	moetunes	I want the system not checking my cd drive all the time.
2010-04-04T13:32:00.000Z	sapphireprayer	moetunes	it seems in the past HAL (in my gentoo) always check it and I disable it.
2010-04-04T13:32:00.000Z	sapphireprayer	moetunes	But is Ubuntu 9.10 using HAL?
2010-04-04T13:33:00.000Z	moetunes	sapphireprayer	afaik it is - and udev - how you control it is beyond me I'm afraid
2010-04-04T13:33:00.000Z	sapphireprayer	moetunes	I see. udev rules ...
2010-04-04T13:34:00.000Z	sapphireprayer	moetunes	and there is no good tools for me to manage it...
2010-04-04T13:34:00.000Z	sapphireprayer	moetunes	Thank you very much.
2010-04-04T13:35:00.000Z	moetunes	sapphireprayer	you could leave it unmounted and just mount it when you  need it
