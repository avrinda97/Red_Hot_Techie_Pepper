2007-05-11T10:43:00.000Z	kitche	rm130	change your mirror
2007-05-11T10:43:00.000Z	rm130	kitche	repository?
2007-05-11T10:43:00.000Z	kitche	rm130	yes repository/mirror
2007-05-11T10:44:00.000Z	rm130	kitche	I can only switch between USA and main, both have the same error
2007-05-11T10:44:00.000Z	kitche	rm130	then it has to deal with the mirrors but you can switch to any mirror really but the permissions are bad on the mirror so it won't matter it seems
2007-05-11T10:45:00.000Z	rm130	kitche	So how can I install the plugin?
2007-05-11T10:47:00.000Z	rm130	kitche	you there?
2007-05-11T10:47:00.000Z	kitche	rm130	can't help you really unless you grab the binary off of suns site for the full j2re
2007-05-11T10:48:00.000Z	rm130	kitche	I did find the binary. but it's not .deb..
2007-05-11T10:48:00.000Z	kitche	rm130	yeah you have to manually install it or wait for the mirrors to be fixed
2007-05-11T10:48:00.000Z	rm130	kitche	could you help me install it?
