2008-04-19T04:42:00.000Z	dizee	jacob_	install the ubuntu-desktop package
2008-04-19T04:43:00.000Z	jacob_	dizee	ubuntu-desktop package?
2008-04-19T04:44:00.000Z	dizee	jacob_	yes, it contains the default ubuntu setup (gnome & the various programs)
2008-04-19T04:46:00.000Z	jacob_	dizee	i'm not trying to re-install ubuntu, my situation is this: i have ubuntu installed, now i want to install kubuntu, but then i want to make ubuntu the default operating system after i install it
2008-04-19T04:46:00.000Z	jacob_	dizee	how would i plan doing that
2008-04-19T04:46:00.000Z	jacob_	dizee	if you know
2008-04-19T04:47:00.000Z	dizee	jacob_	oh ok. then just install kubuntu-desktop ;)
2008-04-19T04:47:00.000Z	jacob_	dizee	will that leave my default OS as ubuntu?
2008-04-19T04:48:00.000Z	jacob_	dizee	are you serious? that sounds fun
2008-04-19T04:48:00.000Z	jacob_	dizee	so i don't need to repartition?
2008-04-19T04:48:00.000Z	dizee	jacob_	no need to repartition at all, yes it is fun :)
2008-04-19T04:51:00.000Z	jacob_	dizee	so let me just make sure i understand this before i make this step, i have an option to select gnome and kde at startup? when i log into kde, i will have the kde desktop environment and have my ubuntu files in there as well?
2008-04-19T04:51:00.000Z	jacob_	dizee	do i need to reinstall drivers?
2008-04-19T04:53:00.000Z	dizee	jacob_	your computer will boot up as normal, at the login screen you can click on an option to change the session and select kde, and this will load kubuntu, all your ubuntu files will be there as well
2008-04-19T04:53:00.000Z	jacob_	dizee	will the drivers be okay as well?
2008-04-19T04:53:00.000Z	dizee	jacob_	no need to reinstall drivers
2008-04-19T04:54:00.000Z	jacob_	dizee	ok, thanks
2008-04-19T04:54:00.000Z	jacob_	dizee	i'm aiming for the beta
2008-04-19T04:56:00.000Z	dizee	jacob_	the hardy beta?
2008-04-19T04:56:00.000Z	jacob_	dizee	yes
2008-04-19T04:57:00.000Z	dizee	jacob_	well then you will have to partition and install kubuntu separately unless you upgraded ubuntu first
