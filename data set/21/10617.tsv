2012-06-01T08:36:00.000Z	WFPKHC		Thank you for that response - is there someone who could provide me with another answer?
2012-06-01T08:37:00.000Z	WFPKHC		thank you i will try that
2012-06-01T08:39:00.000Z	WFPKHC		is there a place where i can download the entire ubuntu iso? not desktop or server but the whole thing?
2012-06-01T08:41:00.000Z	WFPKHC		well in another linux distro they have a dvd version that is 3.6gb
2012-06-01T08:41:00.000Z	WFPKHC		if i download the desktop version can i install server software on it?
2012-06-01T08:41:00.000Z	reisio	WFPKHC	yup
2012-06-01T08:42:00.000Z	reisio	WFPKHC	the only difference between them is the default config/preinstalled software
2012-06-01T08:42:00.000Z	reisio	WFPKHC	yes, but not that you'll notice as a human
2012-06-01T08:43:00.000Z	reisio	WFPKHC	what if you don't
2012-06-01T08:44:00.000Z	reisio	WFPKHC	yes, amd64 was the original name, we don't rename things in Unix land
2012-06-09T04:43:00.000Z	reisio	WFPKHC	http://ubuntu.com/
2012-06-09T04:44:00.000Z	reisio	WFPKHC	or more faster (by picking a closer mirror): https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+cdmirrors
2012-06-09T04:44:00.000Z	reisio	WFPKHC	what's wrong with that?
2012-06-09T04:45:00.000Z	reisio	WFPKHC	mmm, then you want Debian netinstall
2012-06-09T04:48:00.000Z	reisio	WFPKHC	presumably some newfangled jargon for 'not using X (the window system)' or 'not using a DE (desktop environment, like GNOME, Unity, etc.)'
2012-06-09T04:58:00.000Z	reisio	WFPKHC	php fpm + suhosin
2012-06-09T04:58:00.000Z	reisio	WFPKHC	makes PHP slightly less ragingly insecure than it is by default
2012-06-09T04:59:00.000Z	reisio	WFPKHC	it makes PHP more secure
2012-06-09T05:02:00.000Z	reisio	WFPKHC	I use unetbootin or dd
2012-06-09T05:04:00.000Z	reisio	WFPKHC	I'd use unetbootin
