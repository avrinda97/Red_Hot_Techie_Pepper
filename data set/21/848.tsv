2011-05-12T21:49:00.000Z	Snicers-Work2	guddu	DHCP is Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol and is an automatic configuration protocol used on IP networks http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol
2011-05-12T21:49:00.000Z	Snicers-Work2	guddu	Are the pc's ips you want running on Windows or Linux?
2011-05-12T21:50:00.000Z	Snicers-Work2	guddu	It is used by default on most modern routers.
2011-05-12T21:51:00.000Z	Snicers-Work2	guddu	Go to his computer, open up the command prompt (start-> type "cmd" -> press enter) then type ipconfig. That will list his internal ip. It will be the one that looks like 192.168.1.XXX (where XXX is a number).
2011-05-12T21:52:00.000Z	Snicers-Work2	guddu	I am aware, but you physically go to his computer and type that in, that will give you his Windows 7 ip address.
2011-05-12T21:53:00.000Z	Snicers-Work2	guddu	if you want yours then just type ifconfig in the terminal
2011-05-12T21:54:00.000Z	Snicers-Work2	guddu	After that just look for your internal IP
2011-05-12T21:55:00.000Z	Snicers-Work2	guddu	I already told you how to find his IP twice, you GO to his computer. You type ipconfig in the command prompt.
2011-05-12T21:57:00.000Z	Snicers-Work2	guddu	nmap -nsP 192.168.0.0/24
