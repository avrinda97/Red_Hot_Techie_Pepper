2007-03-21T07:04:00.000Z	vitalstatistix		anyone here with a laptop with a geforce go 6400 + turbocache gpu
2007-03-21T07:05:00.000Z	vitalstatistix		shout 'yeah' if you have a laptop with a geforce go 6400 + turbocache gpu
2007-03-21T07:05:00.000Z	Silver_Seagull	vitalstatistix	I have a GeForce Go 7700 512MB if that's close enough for volunteer work...
2007-03-21T07:06:00.000Z	vitalstatistix	Silver_Seagull	do you have suspend to ram (S3) working?
2007-03-21T07:07:00.000Z	Silver_Seagull	vitalstatistix	oops, I mean, "Hmmm, not sure.  Why don't I try?"
2007-03-21T07:07:00.000Z	vitalstatistix	Silver_Seagull	is this a laptop? I'm surprised you haven't attempted this yet
2007-03-21T07:16:00.000Z	Silver_Seagull	vitalstatistix	Timeout at last - I'm me again
2007-03-21T07:16:00.000Z	vitalstatistix	Silver_Seagull	I'm assuming your using beryl - At least your backlight comes on and you have system use
2007-03-21T07:17:00.000Z	Silver_Seagull	vitalstatistix	I have the cursor- no visuals
2007-03-21T07:18:00.000Z	vitalstatistix	Silver_Seagull	you might need to switch VT's to get the visuals back - try ctrl+alt+F1 followed by a ctrl+alt+F7
2007-03-21T07:18:00.000Z	vitalstatistix	Silver_Seagull	I'm also assuming your using the latest nvidia-driver (9755)?
2007-03-21T07:18:00.000Z	Silver_Seagull	vitalstatistix	heh - it's not a feature I use much :)
2007-03-21T07:20:00.000Z	Silver_Seagull	vitalstatistix	hmm, 9746
2007-03-21T07:21:00.000Z	vitalstatistix	Silver_Seagull	it's usually advisable to switch to the latest binary driver before downgrading to a working one since fixes might have been introduced
2007-03-21T07:22:00.000Z	vitalstatistix	Silver_Seagull	but 9755 is quite new
2007-03-21T07:22:00.000Z	Silver_Seagull	vitalstatistix	thanks - I usually try to stay on top of the releases....guess I missed one during midterms :)
2007-03-21T07:22:00.000Z	Silver_Seagull	vitalstatistix	Any idea on a choppy cursor on high CPU load though?
2007-03-21T07:23:00.000Z	vitalstatistix	Silver_Seagull	I'm still recovering from a midterm
2007-03-21T07:26:00.000Z	vitalstatistix	Silver_Seagull	this is an issue with AIGLX on nvidia cards - I use the latest XGL from git which solves that issue
2007-03-21T07:26:00.000Z	vitalstatistix	Silver_Seagull	you are using aiglx right?
2007-03-21T07:26:00.000Z	vitalstatistix	Silver_Seagull	it could be an issue with xorg
