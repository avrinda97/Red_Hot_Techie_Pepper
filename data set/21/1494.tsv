2010-08-25T06:52:00.000Z	edbian	endhiran	Hello.  :)  before I answer why did you pick me to ask?
2010-08-25T06:53:00.000Z	edbian	endhiran	No worries!
2010-08-25T06:53:00.000Z	edbian	endhiran	I was just curious.
2010-08-25T06:54:00.000Z	edbian	endhiran	Install the package "ubuntu-restricted-extras"
2010-08-25T06:54:00.000Z	endhiran	edbian	how........... ?
2010-08-25T06:54:00.000Z	edbian	endhiran	Let me help him first.  Hang on a second.
2010-08-25T06:55:00.000Z	edbian	endhiran	Hi.
2010-08-25T06:55:00.000Z	edbian	endhiran	He left so I'm here now :)
2010-08-25T06:55:00.000Z	edbian	endhiran	Would you like to learn how to install a package via the cli or gui??
2010-08-25T06:56:00.000Z	edbian	endhiran	System -> Admin -> Synaptic package manager.
2010-08-25T06:57:00.000Z	edbian	endhiran	This software is a window to the repository database.  It lists every software package.  You can right click on them to install or remove.  Green filled boxes are installed.
2010-08-25T06:58:00.000Z	edbian	endhiran	Try install the package "ubuntu-restricted-extras" and then try to play the song again.
2010-08-25T06:58:00.000Z	edbian	endhiran	Let's make sure collabra is right.
2010-08-25T06:59:00.000Z	edbian	endhiran	Find that package using syanptic.  You can search it using the search tool.  When you find it right click on it and choose install.
2010-08-25T07:00:00.000Z	edbian	endhiran	I'm very nervous this won't work.
2010-08-25T07:00:00.000Z	edbian	endhiran	I warn you it may be a bit of a wild goose chase.
2010-08-25T07:01:00.000Z	edbian	endhiran	Mhmm
2010-08-25T07:01:00.000Z	edbian	endhiran	See what the others said about the issue?  You probably wanna try those things as well.
2010-08-25T07:29:00.000Z	edbian	endhiran	Mmmm maybe collabra was right! :(
