2005-08-30T08:05:00.000Z	Orborde		I'm trying to get the 32-bit version of Firefox installed on my Ubuntu 64-bit system, and I can only find it as an RPM. Should I use Synaptic to remove my current Firefox version and then install the new Firefox by converting the rpm to a deb and then installing it? Or is this utterly loony?
2005-08-30T08:06:00.000Z	adriyel	Orborde	just update Firefox with synaptic and be done with it
2005-08-30T08:06:00.000Z	Orborde	adriyel	Um....what do you mean? Synaptic gives me 64-bit Firefox...I think....
2005-08-30T08:06:00.000Z	adriyel		additionally, Orborde , you might want to delete or move the file libflash-mozplugin.so out of your firefox directory
2005-08-30T08:07:00.000Z	adriyel		I don't know if Synaptic gives you a 64 bit version of Firefox, but frankly man, does it bloody matter?
2005-08-30T08:07:00.000Z	adriyel		its a web browser Orborde , not a physics simulator
2005-08-30T08:07:00.000Z	adriyel		besides, 64bit apps eat more memory space, which is more important with a web browser than OMG WEB PAGE LOADED IN 0.01ms INSTEAD OF 0.015ms
2005-08-30T08:07:00.000Z	Orborde	adriyel	I want Flash to work. It doesn't get along with 64-bit Firefox AFAIK, but I dunno.
2005-08-30T08:08:00.000Z	adriyel		what makes you think theres a 64bit flash plugin? *laughs*
2005-08-30T08:08:00.000Z	adriyel		ask macromedia if they've compiled a 64bit plugin, or if they'll give you the source to do it...*chuckle*
2005-08-30T08:08:00.000Z	Orborde	adriyel	I know there isn't. But I gather that running 32bit Firefox might work.
2005-08-30T08:09:00.000Z	adriyel		in theory.
2005-08-30T08:09:00.000Z	adriyel		I've had experience with the bug you're talking about
2005-08-30T08:09:00.000Z	adriyel		I did a gdb backtrace
2005-08-30T08:09:00.000Z	adriyel		its possible it might still crash/not work with a 32bit Firefox
2005-08-30T08:09:00.000Z	adriyel		so, it might be all in vain
2005-08-30T08:09:00.000Z	adriyel		additionally, not using synaptic with a distro as heavily modified as Ubuntu, is, unwise, to say the least
2005-08-30T08:10:00.000Z	adriyel		if you're sudo'ing or using root, its a good way to kill your Linux install
2005-08-30T08:10:00.000Z	Orborde	adriyel	Okay.
2005-08-30T08:10:00.000Z	adriyel		WYSIWYG
2005-08-30T08:11:00.000Z	adriyel	Orborde	if you're that thirsty for Flash, try a different browser to Firefox until the plugin gets fixed, I believe it will get fixed with 5.10/breezy, for now, see if any other browsers support a 64bit flash plugin (opera?)
