2010-04-28T22:19:00.000Z	FirstSgt		I am looking for linux software similar to logmein, that will maintain a persistant outbound connection from our offices to our webservers.  once logging in, commands can be sent to the linux box at the office requesting a connection.  Similar to a hacker's reverse bind connect.  But I need a secure way to do this, as logmein does not support linux, and we are unable to port-forward at our offices.  Using ubuntu helena

2010-04-28T22:20:00.000Z	LzrdKing	FirstSgt	you can, just use an unused port
2010-04-28T22:20:00.000Z	LzrdKing	FirstSgt	i've heard some good things about TeamViewer
2010-04-28T22:22:00.000Z	LzrdKing	FirstSgt	ahhh, he won't allow it; doesn't mean you can't do it
2010-04-28T22:23:00.000Z	LzrdKing	FirstSgt	thats the point of the tunnel, it IS requested
2010-04-28T22:26:00.000Z	FirstSgt	LzrdKing	BedMan: How would I tell the server (behind the firewall) where to initiate the connection to?
2010-04-28T22:27:00.000Z	LzrdKing	FirstSgt	you'd need a box you could ssh to directly; indeed thats all logmein and teamviewer provide, that middle box on the internet, not behind a firewall
2010-04-28T22:28:00.000Z	LzrdKing	FirstSgt	your IP changed every minute or something?
2010-04-28T22:28:00.000Z	FirstSgt	LzrdKing	no.  it never changes at the office.
2010-04-28T22:29:00.000Z	LzrdKing	FirstSgt	why would you need cron to check a webserver for the ip?
2010-04-28T22:32:00.000Z	FirstSgt	LzrdKing	the servers at the office accept no incoming connections, but the outside IP is static
2010-04-28T22:32:00.000Z	LzrdKing	FirstSgt	can you ssh to any computer that is accessable on the internet?
2010-04-28T22:33:00.000Z	FirstSgt	LzrdKing	yes.  our production web server has ssh via public key on different port
2010-04-28T22:33:00.000Z	LzrdKing	FirstSgt	so ssh there, and use the -L or -R options to forward ports
2010-04-28T22:36:00.000Z	LzrdKing	FirstSgt	you'd ssh to the port you're forwarding
2010-04-28T22:37:00.000Z	FirstSgt	LzrdKing	do you konw of a good guide or a good term to google for?
2010-04-28T22:38:00.000Z	LzrdKing	FirstSgt	google for vnc over ssh
2010-04-28T22:38:00.000Z	FirstSgt	LzrdKing	thanks
2010-04-28T22:38:00.000Z	FirstSgt	LzrdKing	thanks for your time too
2010-04-28T22:39:00.000Z	LzrdKing	FirstSgt	if you want cli access, install screen abd use on the server you want to access
