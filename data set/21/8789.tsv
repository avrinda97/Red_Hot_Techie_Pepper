2006-10-12T13:20:00.000Z	raar		Hello, I'm installing Ubuntu and it doesn't seem to be installing grub properly (doesn't write the mbr). So when the installation program reboots, it boots to my old OS (WinXP) or when the installation CD is still in, it starts the installation again - any clue how to get Ubuntu to properly install GRUB (or write it to the MBR)?

2006-10-12T13:22:00.000Z	Terminus	raar	oh yeah, make sure your bios isn't prohibiting writes to the mbr.
2006-10-12T13:22:00.000Z	raar	Terminus	I'm having problems installing grub, as I'm not sure how to define my devices and everything in grub-install
2006-10-12T13:23:00.000Z	raar	Terminus	I've checked in there, I even tried with "OS Install Mode" :)
2006-10-12T13:24:00.000Z	Terminus	raar	sorry, that's all i can think of. i've never encountered grub problems that couldn't be fixed by running grub-install manually. =|
2006-10-12T13:26:00.000Z	Terminus	raar	oh, you mean you're not sure whether the drive is hda, hdb, sda, etc?
2006-10-12T13:28:00.000Z	raar	Terminus	I know it's sda3, but am not sure how to specify that with grub-install.. It's quite complicated to work with, in my opinion
2006-10-12T13:29:00.000Z	Terminus	raar	i see... as far as i remember, it's the drive that should be specified, not the partition, since you're trying to install the mbr. so it should be /dev/sda
2006-10-12T13:30:00.000Z	raar	Terminus	ah okay, I'll give that a shot in a minute, thanks :)
2006-10-12T13:33:00.000Z	Terminus	raar	good luck! that advice doesn't come with warranties. =D
2006-10-12T13:34:00.000Z	Terminus	raar	weird how it couldn't install the mbr though... i've never installed an OS that couldn't write to the mbr.
2006-10-12T13:35:00.000Z	raar	Terminus	I tried this an hour ago or so: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows#head-a0b7dbaec35668690d12cc1b9a681d218c4ae89b - at point 5 it says "Do not format them", however the Ubuntu installation program tells me it has to format the filesystems needed by ubuntu in order to install the OS. After that there's no "Install Grub" anywhere..
2006-10-12T13:36:00.000Z	raar	Terminus	yeah, I was quite confused too - I've been trying around with this for atleast 15 hours now
2006-10-12T13:36:00.000Z	Terminus	raar	is that a custom box or not?
2006-10-12T13:37:00.000Z	Terminus	raar	i'm just guessing but it might be some weird dell/hp/whatever thingy.
2006-10-12T13:37:00.000Z	raar	Terminus	it's a dell, some custom components, but they're all quite standard for a desktop pc
2006-10-12T13:38:00.000Z	Terminus	raar	coz i was thinking it might be something weird with their recovery partition and stuff. did you check if the bios prohibits mbr writes?
2006-10-12T13:41:00.000Z	raar	Terminus	I've installed quite a few OSes in this system before and never had any problems, I've even enabled "OS Install Mode" in my BIOS.. Couldn't find anything that looks like a read only setting for the MBR :(
2006-10-12T13:42:00.000Z	Terminus	raar	well, i'm out of ideas. =(
2006-10-12T13:45:00.000Z	raar	Terminus	alright, thanks very much for your help, I'll give it another shot
