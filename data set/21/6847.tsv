2008-03-21T06:39:00.000Z	computer13137	unop	Multiple accounts and stuff?
2008-03-21T06:40:00.000Z	computer13137	unop	I just want multiple users to be able to login and do stuff...and "close the session" while leaving stuff running.
2008-03-21T06:40:00.000Z	computer13137	unop	Those are the main features I'm concerned with.
2008-03-21T06:52:00.000Z	computer13137	unop	OK...
2008-03-21T07:34:00.000Z	unop	computer13137	nope
2008-03-21T09:39:00.000Z	computer13137	unop	 Could you have a look at this?  http://p.just-owns.eu/p/t_8161206077891.txt
2008-03-21T09:41:00.000Z	unop	computer13137	can you post that again -- this time include the command you typed to cause that error
2008-03-21T09:41:00.000Z	computer13137	unop	I typed "make"... as specified by the program's install.txt. :P
2008-03-21T09:43:00.000Z	computer13137	unop	not sure if you saw it before.  I typed "make".
2008-03-21T09:43:00.000Z	unop	computer13137	I have a feeling that necessary dev packages might not be available -- check the packages requirements and make sure you satisfy them all
2008-03-21T09:50:00.000Z	unop	computer13137	??
2008-03-21T09:50:00.000Z	computer13137	unop	This program also has a readme on how to make a DEB file for this.  It tells me to run a command... the command results in an error.  http://p.just-owns.eu/p/t_2101206078587.txt
2008-03-21T09:51:00.000Z	unop	computer13137	ok .. but that doesnt necessarily mean you have all the required packages/requirements to build this source, does it?
2008-03-21T09:51:00.000Z	computer13137	unop	The program doesn't say it has any dependencies.
2008-03-21T09:51:00.000Z	unop	computer13137	what are you trying to build?
2008-03-21T09:52:00.000Z	computer13137	unop	xrdp
2008-03-21T09:52:00.000Z	computer13137	unop	http://sourceforge.net/projects/xrdp/
2008-03-21T09:54:00.000Z	unop	computer13137	can you use the pastebin instead of the text file you have -- its hard to read with the misformatting
2008-03-21T09:54:00.000Z	unop	computer13137	pastebin your error
2008-03-21T09:55:00.000Z	computer13137	unop	Fine. :P
