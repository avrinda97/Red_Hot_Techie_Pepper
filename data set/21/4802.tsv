2008-05-29T01:38:00.000Z	maximilion		hey guys :) Should I ask for a stable mp3 player here or in another channel?
2008-05-29T01:39:00.000Z	maximilion		Right BCM43 , the name of the channel? :)
2008-05-29T01:40:00.000Z	maximilion		Well, I'm running 32-bit Gutsy Gibbon and VLC is not at all stable.
2008-05-29T01:40:00.000Z	Boohbah	maximilion	you could try amarok, the 1.4 branch is pretty stable...
2008-05-29T01:43:00.000Z	Boohbah	maximilion	you could try mpd, it's very minimal and has a few options for GUIs
2008-05-29T01:44:00.000Z	Boohbah	maximilion	my favorite is amarok, because i like the collection db and search functions
2008-05-29T03:02:00.000Z	Boohbah	maximilion	because xmms is a piece of crap
2008-05-29T03:02:00.000Z	maximilion	Boohbah	can you recommend a nice simple one like it but better?
2008-05-29T03:03:00.000Z	Boohbah	maximilion	what are your requirements? low memory usage? gui? command line?
2008-05-29T03:03:00.000Z	Boohbah	maximilion	music library management?\
2008-05-29T03:03:00.000Z	maximilion	Boohbah	"Like Winamp 3".. kinda... or FooBar2000 :)
2008-05-29T03:04:00.000Z	maximilion	Boohbah	don't need management, I have a folder structure that works fine for me :)
2008-05-29T03:04:00.000Z	Boohbah	maximilion	i haven't used foobar
2008-05-29T03:04:00.000Z	Boohbah	maximilion	i guess xmms is the closest to winamp 3
2008-05-29T03:05:00.000Z	maximilion	Boohbah	yeah, and there's a Winamp 3 alpha 1 for Linux, but... it feels like the volume control thing should be solvable
2008-05-29T03:08:00.000Z	Boohbah	maximilion	did you have xmms working in another version of ubuntu?
2008-05-29T03:14:00.000Z	maximilion	Boohbah	I'm on Gutsy Gibbon, and yeah it works perfectly bar the volume control... kinda useful feature to have tho :)
2008-05-29T03:15:00.000Z	Boohbah	maximilion	can you change the volume with the sound mixer app?
2008-05-29T03:16:00.000Z	maximilion	Boohbah	had ALSAmixergui working, now it won't start
2008-05-29T03:17:00.000Z	Boohbah	maximilion	how bout 'amixer' from the terminal?
2008-05-29T03:18:00.000Z	Boohbah	maximilion	or alsamixer from terminal
