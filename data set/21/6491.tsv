2007-03-22T08:04:00.000Z	gossrock	hendaus	what do you need?
2007-03-22T08:05:00.000Z	hendaus	gossrock	 thanx, i need to configure xgnokii coz the configuration is wrong
2007-03-22T08:06:00.000Z	hendaus	gossrock	 i want to change the port
2007-03-22T08:07:00.000Z	gossrock	hendaus	sorry I don't know xgnokii.  I will poke around though ...
2007-03-22T08:07:00.000Z	hendaus	gossrock	 another problem how could i configure the monitor to switch off after 20 minutes
2007-03-22T08:09:00.000Z	gossrock	hendaus	that I might be able to help with ... I'm on Dapper so it may be a bit different ... let me check to be sure ... stand by.
2007-03-22T08:10:00.000Z	gossrock	hendaus	under dapper you would go to the System Menu -> Preferances --> Power Management
2007-03-22T08:11:00.000Z	gossrock	hendaus	there you should have options for both when it's pluged in and when it's not ... (I'm on a laptop)
2007-03-22T08:14:00.000Z	hendaus	gossrock	 ok i have edgy,i enter system settings -> display -> powersaving
2007-03-22T08:15:00.000Z	gossrock	hendaus	ah good, that was easy :)
2007-03-22T08:15:00.000Z	hendaus	gossrock	 i put 20 minutes,the monitor switchoff but the green color on the power still not orange why?
2007-03-22T08:16:00.000Z	gossrock	hendaus	hmm, not sure, it may be that what the power saving is doing is just sending a black screen (I'm not sure though)
2007-03-22T08:17:00.000Z	hendaus	gossrock	 i want the monitor to switch off with the orange color
2007-03-22T08:20:00.000Z	gossrock	hendaus	I've never had that problem but that's because I only have run Ubuntu on a laptop and I don't have the orang light ... Does the Dialoge say Power Management Preferences at the top and have 3 tabs in it (checking to see if we are looking at the same dialoge)
2007-03-22T08:21:00.000Z	hendaus	gossrock	 display-system Settings
2007-03-22T08:26:00.000Z	gossrock	hendaus	sorry but I seem to be of no help.
2007-03-22T08:27:00.000Z	hendaus	gossrock	 ok
