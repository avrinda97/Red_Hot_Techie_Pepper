2009-09-07T12:55:00.000Z	|Steve|		I mean, I can always do sudo su -.
2009-09-07T12:56:00.000Z	|Steve|		Ah, sure. -i.
2009-09-07T12:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	|Steve|	if you have root disabled then they must guess a username which is a member of the admin group as well as the password, with root the username is already known
2009-09-07T13:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	|Steve|	yet
2009-09-07T13:01:00.000Z	|Steve|	ActionParsnip1	You forgot the *dun dun dun* after that.
2009-09-07T13:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	|Steve|	if you have it disabled your system is more secure
2009-09-07T13:02:00.000Z	|Steve|	ActionParsnip1	No one has demonstrated that.
2009-09-07T13:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	|Steve|	the root account is common to all nix systems so all an attacker has to do is guess the password, if it is disabled, an attacker has to exactly guess a username as well as the password
2009-09-07T13:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	|Steve|	you have halved the work needed to be done
2009-09-07T13:03:00.000Z	|Steve|	ActionParsnip1	For the third time, disallow remote root login.
2009-09-07T13:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	|Steve|	also, many linux techies sat round and discussed this at length and decided it was a fantastic idea, but i'm sure you know better, right
2009-09-07T13:04:00.000Z	|Steve|	ActionParsnip1	Appeal to authority works, but you have to actually name the authority.
2009-09-07T13:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	|Steve|	you cant boot into anything without a bootloader, grub is your bootloader
2009-09-07T13:09:00.000Z	|Steve|	ActionParsnip1	Um, no, it isn't.
2009-09-07T13:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	|Steve|	its the default, you havent stated you were using anything different
2009-09-07T13:10:00.000Z	|Steve|	ActionParsnip1	It's certainly not the default on my platform (or even an option).
2009-09-07T13:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	|Steve|	your witness ^
2009-09-07T13:11:00.000Z	|Steve|	ActionParsnip1	Powerpc.
2009-09-07T13:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	|Steve|	again, please provide better information so we dont have to guess
2009-09-07T13:12:00.000Z	|Steve|	ActionParsnip1	I'm not asking for help, I merely asked if single user mode were possible without grub. You were the one who kept insisting that I was using grub.
