2005-05-09T07:10:00.000Z	dazzed	thoreauputic	thanks
2005-05-09T07:10:00.000Z	thoreauputic	dazzed	or date
2005-05-09T12:41:00.000Z	thoreauputic	dazzed	the hoary flux is fairly recent
2005-05-09T12:41:00.000Z	dazzed	thoreauputic	hoary flux is 9.11 and 9.12 has fixed some major bugs in last couple of weeks (via svn)
2005-05-09T12:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	dazzed	I compiled 0.9.12 a month or so ago :)
2005-05-09T12:42:00.000Z	dazzed	thoreauputic	your pretty set then for the most part...it just has fixed some of the systray bugs and transparency bugs so on and so on
2005-05-09T12:43:00.000Z	thoreauputic	dazzed	haven't noticed any bugs here
2005-05-09T12:44:00.000Z	dazzed	thoreauputic	the one main bug of 9.12 is that when you drag windows to other workspaces it can get stuck in a never ending loop but if you dont do that then ur fine
2005-05-09T12:57:00.000Z	thoreauputic	dazzed	I guess that worked ;)
2005-05-09T13:12:00.000Z	dazzed	thoreauputic	is that your flux?
2005-09-25T14:24:00.000Z	dazzed	thoreauputic	long time  no see
2005-09-25T14:25:00.000Z	thoreauputic	dazzed	oh, I've been around - just less active than usual :)
2005-09-25T14:25:00.000Z	dazzed	thoreauputic	its me that has been less active...since i have been home from college this is one of the first times i have got my linux machine on the net :)
2005-09-25T14:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	dazzed	sounds far fetched, but some people have found disabling ipv6 in about:config has made FF work for them
2005-09-25T14:33:00.000Z	thoreauputic	dazzed	seriously, try disabling ipv6 in about:config and see if it helps - you can reverse it with a click anyway
2005-09-25T14:33:00.000Z	dazzed	thoreauputic	gave that a shot no luck
2005-09-25T14:33:00.000Z	thoreauputic	dazzed	OK
