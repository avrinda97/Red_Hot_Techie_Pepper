2006-02-25T11:39:00.000Z	Edulix		hi !
2006-02-25T11:39:00.000Z	Edulix		I've downloaded dapper4
2006-02-25T11:40:00.000Z	Edulix		dapperflight4-i386-install.iso, and the md5sum is correct
2006-02-25T11:40:00.000Z	Edulix		but I've burned twice and checked twice the cd, and it always fails in libreiserfs
2006-02-25T11:40:00.000Z	Edulix		is it ok?
2006-02-25T11:41:00.000Z	Edulix		or even known? any problem with reiserfs in dapper flight 4?
2006-02-25T11:41:00.000Z	Gnumannen	Edulix	does it hang, or do yu get an error?
2006-02-25T11:42:00.000Z	Edulix	Gnumannen	when cheichking the cd integrity, which is an option in the cd, it says that the md5 for the deb libreiserfs isn't correct
2006-02-25T11:43:00.000Z	Gnumannen	Edulix	I have had som problems which reminds me of yours.
2006-02-25T11:43:00.000Z	Edulix	Gnumannen	my concern is that all my partitions are reiserfs
2006-02-25T11:44:00.000Z	Gnumannen	Edulix	Okey, then it's quite a big problem.
2006-02-25T11:44:00.000Z	Gnumannen		But Edulix, do you really ahve to use Dapper? After all it's just a beta.
2006-02-25T11:45:00.000Z	Edulix	Gnumannen	of course, but betas are for testing purposes, that's what I was trying to do hehe
2006-02-25T11:45:00.000Z	Gnumannen	Edulix	hehe, well, you have certainly found a bug ;)
2006-02-25T11:46:00.000Z	Edulix		I'll report it then
2006-02-25T11:47:00.000Z	Edulix	Gnumannen	anyway, what problems did you have? you say that mine reminded you some problems
2006-02-25T11:48:00.000Z	Gnumannen	Edulix	it was in 5.10 I think, or maybe even in Ubuntu, alot of packages during the installtion ere corrupted.
2006-02-25T11:48:00.000Z	Gnumannen		*sry Debian
2006-02-25T11:48:00.000Z	Edulix	Gnumannen	and thus they didn't work ?
2006-02-25T11:49:00.000Z	Edulix		anyone with reiserfs partitons had problems with dapper flight 4?
2006-02-25T11:49:00.000Z	Gnumannen	Edulix	Well, no. But I'm running 6.04 anyway now
