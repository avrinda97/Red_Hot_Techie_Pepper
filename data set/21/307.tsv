2012-03-12T07:12:00.000Z	slothscripts		I am trying to repair my Windows 7 install, so that I can boot into Windows as grub is not functioning properly. I created a recovery disc; and ran "start-up recovery" or whatever from the disc on start-up. There was no apparent effect from it. Any suggestions?
2012-03-12T07:13:00.000Z	StepNjump	slothscripts	Have you tried fixmbr command ?
2012-03-12T07:13:00.000Z	slothscripts	StepNjump	I have not. It's a windows command?
2012-03-12T07:14:00.000Z	StepNjump	slothscripts	yes it is... YOu can't log on to windows right?<
2012-03-12T07:14:00.000Z	slothscripts		Correct. But I now have a recovery/installation disc so I can run command prompt through it.
2012-03-12T07:16:00.000Z	slothscripts	StepNjump	Is there more to the command than "fixmbr" that I will require; if it is going to work?
2012-03-12T07:17:00.000Z	StepNjump		Yes, run this repair disc from Windows and run the fixmbr command in the pseudo DOS there... That will OVERWRITE the grub in the MBR but then your ubuntu will no longer boot up from Grub as grub in the MBR will be gone so you will have to go in ubuntu using a pendrive and then fix your grub from there.. There is a command but I forget what it is.. something like grub-update or something along those
2012-03-12T07:17:00.000Z	StepNjump		lines
2012-03-12T07:18:00.000Z	slothscripts		Okay, but that command should permit me to run windows again?
2012-03-12T07:18:00.000Z	StepNjump	slothscripts	Fixmbr should reinitailize your boot sector to Windows default... then you will be able to boot into your win partition.
2012-03-12T07:18:00.000Z	slothscripts		Sounds awesome! Thank you so much! If I'm not back within a while it means it worked and you have saved me! :)
2012-03-12T07:19:00.000Z	StepNjump		Or try to do grub-update or update-grub from ubuntu first to see if it will detect your windows partition first
2012-03-12T07:19:00.000Z	slothscripts		I've tried prior.
2012-03-12T07:19:00.000Z	slothscripts		No luck :(
2012-03-12T07:19:00.000Z	slothscripts		Thank you very much for your help!
2012-03-12T07:19:00.000Z	StepNjump		not fixmbr yet right slothscripts
2012-03-12T07:20:00.000Z	StepNjump		If it's important for you to log in your win, try the fixmbr, it's your best bet
2012-03-12T07:20:00.000Z	StepNjump		It's always worked for me slothscripts
2012-03-12T07:20:00.000Z	slothscripts		That's what is most important right now; to log into it without having to reinstall the operating system; I will try it now.
2012-03-12T07:21:00.000Z	slothscripts		Thank you :)
2012-03-12T07:23:00.000Z	StepNjump	slothscripts	Try to backup your ubuntu data first in case you might have to reinstall your ubuntu after running fixmbr cuz you will not be able to go back to ubuntu after that unless you use a pendrive and you are familiar with the CLI to cd into the proper linux partition and mount it. Its simple but if you dont know how, would be easier for you to back up your ubuntu home folder first and reinstall
