2010-05-27T03:37:00.000Z	ikonia	undecim	you can with kvm though
2010-10-12T21:17:00.000Z	undecim	ikonia	He has an ext4 patition on sda5
2010-10-12T21:17:00.000Z	undecim	ikonia	Look at the disk util in the image he posted
2010-10-12T21:17:00.000Z	ikonia	undecim	then what's the problem
2010-10-12T21:17:00.000Z	undecim	ikonia	The installer doesn't see it.
2010-10-12T21:18:00.000Z	ikonia	undecim	how do you know he has a partition then
2010-10-12T21:18:00.000Z	undecim	ikonia	This disk utility sees it
2010-10-12T21:18:00.000Z	ikonia	undecim	which one ?
2010-10-12T21:18:00.000Z	undecim	ikonia	The one in the image he posted
2010-10-12T21:18:00.000Z	ikonia	undecim	the one in the image doesn't show anything under sda
2010-10-12T21:19:00.000Z	undecim	ikonia	Look at the DISK UTILITY, not the installer
2010-10-12T21:19:00.000Z	ikonia	undecim	ahh I see it
2010-10-12T21:19:00.000Z	ikonia	undecim	it's a HPFS partition type
2010-10-12T21:20:00.000Z	undecim	ikonia	Yes, that's just sda1. Look at the volumes in the graphic above that info and sda5 is an ext4
2010-10-12T21:21:00.000Z	ikonia	undecim	he's got a 656GB mbr ???
2010-10-12T21:21:00.000Z	ikonia	undecim	that disk looks messed up
2010-10-12T21:21:00.000Z	undecim	ikonia	No, that's an NTFS filesystem.
