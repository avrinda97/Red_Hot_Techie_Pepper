2006-02-28T11:39:00.000Z	GTX		Guy's I run ubuntu on my servers, however users can see into peoples first home directory, how can I fix this.
2006-02-28T11:40:00.000Z	farous	GTX	man chmod
2006-02-28T11:40:00.000Z	farous	GTX	you need to change the permissions
2006-02-28T11:40:00.000Z	GTX	farous	I need chmod
2006-02-28T11:40:00.000Z	GTX	farous	To what thoe
2006-02-28T11:41:00.000Z	farous	GTX	depend how you did set it the users and groups
2006-02-28T11:41:00.000Z	GTX	farous	There in /home/
2006-02-28T11:41:00.000Z	GTX	farous	so I'd have to chmod /home/ ?
2006-02-28T11:42:00.000Z	farous		gtx tell me what you want them to see exactly
2006-02-28T11:42:00.000Z	farous		but basically you need to read the man pages
2006-02-28T11:42:00.000Z	GTX	farous	only there directory, I dont want them to be able to cd /home/
2006-02-28T11:42:00.000Z	GTX		and see other users
2006-02-28T11:43:00.000Z	farous	GTX	i only know how to set it that they can not enter the dir of other users. but they can cd to the home dir
2006-02-28T11:43:00.000Z	GTX	farous	yeah thats what i want
2006-02-28T11:43:00.000Z	GTX		so they cannot enter dir of other users
2006-02-28T11:44:00.000Z	farous	GTX	sudo chmod 700 /home/<user name> will give this user acess to his dir to read write and execute
2006-02-28T11:45:00.000Z	GTX	farous	?
2006-02-28T11:45:00.000Z	GTX	farous	I want to do it on all users.
2006-02-28T11:46:00.000Z	farous	GTX	i recommend it one by one or use wild card do not know if it will work
2006-02-28T11:46:00.000Z	farous	GTX	do not want something to break :)
2006-02-28T11:47:00.000Z	farous	GTX	you have to man it. some of the . hidden files need to be read by others so take care
