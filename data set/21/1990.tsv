2010-03-16T03:26:00.000Z	hal		yeha, I just noticed the icon near my username

2010-03-16T03:29:00.000Z	Typos_King	hal	  install kde,   j/k
2010-03-16T03:30:00.000Z	hal	Typos_King	thanks
2010-03-25T02:05:00.000Z	Typos_King	hal	   check in the control panel and under ... either services or session, whetre it shows the services running at boot, and click on Start if it's stopped
2010-03-25T02:06:00.000Z	hal	Typos_King	hi there.  I don't have a window manager installed ;)
2010-03-25T02:08:00.000Z	hal	Typos_King	I've installed swat and there is an entry for it in inetd.conf  - swat  stream tcp nowait.400 root /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/sbin/swat
2010-03-25T02:09:00.000Z	Typos_King	hal	  you know, I don't see it on my end... no as a default service
2010-03-25T02:11:00.000Z	Typos_King	hal	  check VCoolio's line, I think -> sudo /etc/init.d/inetd restart;  may do it
2010-03-25T02:18:00.000Z	Typos_King	hal	  check VCoolio's line, I think -> sudo /etc/init.d/inetd restart;  may do it  <---
2010-03-25T02:18:00.000Z	Typos_King	hal	   did you try that?   if inetd   is there, I think the 'restart' argument will get it rolling
2010-03-25T02:19:00.000Z	hal	Typos_King	no, there is no script with that name
2010-03-25T02:20:00.000Z	Typos_King	hal	  since you have no window manager.. how about installing -> sudo apt-get sysv-rc-conf;  is a console bootup services utility, and you can stop/start/restart/remove any from there with just + or - presses
2010-03-25T02:22:00.000Z	hal	Typos_King	I have chkconfig, which i prefer.  But it wasn't really that I didn't expect it to start on boot - but more that I didn't know how to start it without booting
2010-04-20T02:31:00.000Z	Typos_King	hal	   you can do that in open office Writer
2010-04-20T02:33:00.000Z	hal	Typos_King	hi  - you can't seem to do it with one click in ooo writer, can you?
2010-04-20T02:34:00.000Z	Typos_King	hal	  sure, type in, your text, select it, then go to Format > Character, the highlighted text will be the 'preview' used and you can click your way through the fonts
