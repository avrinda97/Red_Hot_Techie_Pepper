2010-02-04T22:16:00.000Z	flootenkerp		Strange, I deleted the .compiz folder and restarted, but all my settings persist
2010-02-04T22:16:00.000Z	flootenkerp		Unless the settings are saved somewhere else
2010-02-04T22:17:00.000Z	flootenkerp		Oh, where is it stored?
2010-02-04T22:17:00.000Z	flootenkerp		Erm, that's the issue
2010-02-04T22:18:00.000Z	flootenkerp		The reason I'm deleting the settings is because I CAN'T SEE THE COMPIZ WINDOW
2010-02-04T22:18:00.000Z	flootenkerp		Apologies for caps.
2010-02-04T22:18:00.000Z	flootenkerp		Exactly
2010-02-04T22:18:00.000Z	flootenkerp		The window for compiz config and all that belongs to it isn't visible
2010-02-04T22:18:00.000Z	flootenkerp		It starts up, but I can't see it visibly
2010-02-04T22:20:00.000Z	flootenkerp		Wouldn't it be easier to delete the settings?
2010-02-04T22:20:00.000Z	soreau	flootenkerp	No
2010-02-04T22:20:00.000Z	flootenkerp		I really only have wobbly windows and desktop cube on
2010-02-04T22:20:00.000Z	flootenkerp		I'll just reset them when I restored everything.
2010-02-04T22:20:00.000Z	soreau	flootenkerp	Actually, if you don't have simple-ccsm installed, setting to None and back to Extra will delete your settings
2010-02-04T22:22:00.000Z	flootenkerp	soreau	here's what I did in detail. I opened up compiz, went to opacity, brightness, and saturation, went to windows settings under opacity, clicked the + icon, and chose the grab feature, grabbed the same window I was on, and clicked okay
2010-02-04T22:22:00.000Z	soreau	flootenkerp	I know
2010-02-04T22:22:00.000Z	flootenkerp		Then the window was still on my taskbar, but invisible
2010-02-04T22:22:00.000Z	soreau	flootenkerp	All's you have to do is get to gnome-appearance-properties>Visual Effects tab and set to None and back to whatever it's set at now
2010-02-04T22:23:00.000Z	flootenkerp		So edit the metacity I'm currently on?
2010-02-04T22:23:00.000Z	flootenkerp		And find the setting in it?
2010-02-04T22:24:00.000Z	soreau	flootenkerp	I'm going to tell you one last time. Go to System>Preferences>Appearance>Visual Effects tab and set to None
