2010-09-15T01:48:00.000Z	seanp2k		yo, i just installed apache2 on 10.04 server and I can't load the default page, do I need to do something to apparmor ?
2010-09-15T01:48:00.000Z	seanp2k		it works locally via lynx but I can't get the page from the host computer that I'm on.  I'm running the ubuntu 10.04 server in a VM
2010-09-15T01:49:00.000Z	seanp2k		I can SSH to it just fine so I know it's not a host<-> VM networking issue
2010-09-15T01:50:00.000Z	geoffmcc	seanp2k	port 80 open in firewall?
2010-09-15T01:51:00.000Z	seanp2k	geoffmcc	is there a firewall installed in server by default?
2010-09-15T01:51:00.000Z	geoffmcc	seanp2k	ufw is installed but not running, but iptables is
2010-09-15T01:51:00.000Z	seanp2k		iptables -L comes up blank
2010-09-15T01:52:00.000Z	seanp2k	geoffmcc	'stop ufw' did it, thx
2010-09-15T01:52:00.000Z	seanp2k	geoffmcc	is there something similar to 'chkconfig ufw off' to disable it from starting on boot?
2010-09-15T01:52:00.000Z	geoffmcc	seanp2k	i would start ufw again and open port 80
2010-09-15T01:53:00.000Z	seanp2k	geoffmcc	it's just a local dev server on my laptop, I don't really want to run / manage a firewall on it
2010-09-15T01:53:00.000Z	geoffmcc	seanp2k	sudo ufw allow 80
2010-09-15T01:53:00.000Z	geoffmcc	seanp2k	oh ok
2010-09-15T01:53:00.000Z	seanp2k	geoffmcc	but thanks for the info.  Do you know if that allows UDP / TCP when you just type "ufw allow 80" ?
2010-09-15T01:54:00.000Z	geoffmcc	seanp2k	think it def to tcp
2010-09-15T01:54:00.000Z	geoffmcc	seanp2k	not to keep pushing firewall but you could also enable it again and allow all traffic from your local network and block other
2010-09-15T01:55:00.000Z	seanp2k	geoffmcc	OK, thanks for your help.  UFW seems to be less of a PITA than the default RHEL firewall :)
2010-09-15T01:56:00.000Z	geoffmcc	seanp2k	real easy to use, i used it till i found apf
2010-09-15T02:00:00.000Z	seanp2k	geoffmcc	we use APF for production stuff :)
2010-09-15T02:00:00.000Z	geoffmcc		in reguards to highlighting text in chat - @username should be an option too i think, but thats just me
2010-09-15T02:01:00.000Z	geoffmcc	seanp2k	i love it- had no problems exept today i setup samba and cant for like of me access it on windows pc even though all ports open - soon as turn off able to access
