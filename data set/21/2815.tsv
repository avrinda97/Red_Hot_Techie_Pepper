2009-10-30T19:50:00.000Z	dual	AceKing	wired. Logitech G5
2009-10-30T19:52:00.000Z	AceKing	dual	ok, I am using a wireless.. I switched with my another mouse and I'm working fine
2009-10-30T19:52:00.000Z	dual	AceKing	usb?
2009-10-30T19:52:00.000Z	AceKing	dual	I switched with another wireless from my laptop
2009-10-30T19:53:00.000Z	dual	AceKing	ok, heard of anyone else having this problem?
2009-10-30T19:53:00.000Z	AceKing	dual	not yet
2009-10-30T19:53:00.000Z	AceKing	dual	do you have another mouse to try?
2009-10-30T19:53:00.000Z	dual	AceKing	hmm, yes, I'll try another one later.

2009-10-30T19:56:00.000Z	AceKing	dual	mine was even double clicking on it's own
2009-10-30T19:56:00.000Z	dual	AceKing	I haven't experiencing that, only lag
2009-10-30T19:58:00.000Z	AceKing	dual	I may have had a different problem then. It may have just been my mouse going bad
2009-10-30T19:58:00.000Z	dual	AceKing	hmm, hard to say.
