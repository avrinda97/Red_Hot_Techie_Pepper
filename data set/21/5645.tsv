2007-09-08T09:17:00.000Z	cari		I cannot seem to mount and/or view contents of a CD. I have been to /media/cdrom0 & cdrom1 ... using a "legit" music cd ... and nothing shows up under either dir
2007-09-08T09:17:00.000Z	nickrud	cari	music cd's don't mount like that ...
2007-09-08T09:18:00.000Z	cari	nickrud	Was orginially attempting to mount the Quake III CD to follow instructions from a post. I resorted to the music disk as i figured the Q3 disk might be the issue
2007-09-08T09:19:00.000Z	nickrud	cari	hm, if you load the quake III disk you don't see an icon on the desktop?
2007-09-08T09:19:00.000Z	cari	nickrud	Correct. No icon on desktop. That is why I navigated to the /media dir
2007-09-08T09:20:00.000Z	nickrud	cari	ok, take out the cd, open a terminal, and type    tail -f /var/log/syslog  in the terminal. That will show a log of what happens when you put the cd back in.

2007-09-08T09:22:00.000Z	nickrud	cari	ok, now put the cd back in, there'll be some more text
2007-09-08T09:23:00.000Z	cari	nickrud	It did not update after putting the CD back in.
2007-09-08T09:23:00.000Z	nickrud	cari	that is not good, the kernel doesn't even see your cd drive. And I am no kernel guru.
2007-09-08T09:24:00.000Z	cari	nickrud	Btw, nor did i close the term window or terminate the command
2007-09-08T09:24:00.000Z	nickrud	cari	you read my mind :)
2007-09-08T09:24:00.000Z	cari	nickrud	If it means anything, husband just updated to Gutsy, clean install.
2007-09-08T09:24:00.000Z	nickrud	cari	ah, ask in #ubuntu+1 , that may be a known issue
2007-09-08T09:25:00.000Z	nickrud	cari	+ one
2007-09-08T09:27:00.000Z	cari	nickrud	Which version are you running, btw?
2007-09-08T09:27:00.000Z	nickrud	cari	gutsy
2007-09-08T09:28:00.000Z	cari	nickrud	I was actually happy in Feisty. I managed to get my extra mouse buttons, extra keyboard buttons working. And read/write to the NTFS.
2007-09-08T09:28:00.000Z	cari	nickrud	And I had found a way to make my speakers actually work in 5.1 which i am having to relearn now. :P
2007-09-08T09:29:00.000Z	nickrud	cari	I'm used to : 5.1? I am jealous
2007-09-08T09:39:00.000Z	cari	nickrud	Would it work attempting to mount the drive in terminal?
