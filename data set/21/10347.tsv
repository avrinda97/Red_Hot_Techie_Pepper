2005-07-11T05:55:00.000Z	jasoncohen	sinferno	apt-get install gstreamer0.8-mad
2005-07-11T05:55:00.000Z	jasoncohen	sinferno	or apt-get install gstreamer0.8-plugins
2005-07-11T05:56:00.000Z	jasoncohen	sinferno	it has nothing to do with rhythmbox. mp3 is trademarked and couldn't be included in main
2005-07-11T05:56:00.000Z	jasoncohen	sinferno	you need to add the universe source
2005-07-11T05:57:00.000Z	jasoncohen	sinferno	if you uncomment the deb lines in /etc/apt/sources.list you'll have all available ubuntu sources. you can also add the sources easily in synaptic

2005-07-11T05:59:00.000Z	jasoncohen	sinferno	you can use either the synaptic or the terminal method
2005-07-11T06:09:00.000Z	jasoncohen	sinferno	no- you have main
2005-07-11T06:09:00.000Z	jasoncohen	sinferno	with universe, multiverse, main, restricted you would have 16,000 or so
2005-07-11T06:09:00.000Z	jasoncohen	sinferno	you need to run apt-get update
2005-07-11T06:11:00.000Z	jasoncohen	sinferno	?
