2012-11-04T22:40:00.000Z	fellayaboy		how do i find a file using terminal...im trying to find a file called myfile.txt  i do find myfile.txt and it says it didnt find anything i know its in the system somewhere
2012-11-04T22:41:00.000Z	fego	fellayaboy	find / -name myfile.txt -print 2>/dev/null
2012-11-04T22:41:00.000Z	fellayaboy		why -print 2>/dev/null
2012-11-04T22:42:00.000Z	fellayaboy	fego	why -print 2>/dev/null
2012-11-04T22:42:00.000Z	fego	fellayaboy	it will send the errors you get due to not having read permissions on files, to a null bucket
2012-11-04T22:42:00.000Z	fellayaboy		ooh ok thank you fego
2012-11-04T22:44:00.000Z	fellayaboy	fego	how do i make it scan the whole system? and all its subdirectories... i did the command and im 1000% certain its not going in deep enuff in the ssytem
2012-11-04T22:45:00.000Z	fego	fellayaboy	the above command line will search the whole system starting from the / dir
2012-11-04T22:45:00.000Z	fego		and its child dirs
2012-11-04T22:46:00.000Z	fellayaboy		well for example fego i did ..  find / -iname *.desktop and it returned only a few *.desktop files and i know theres way more i dont get whats up
2012-11-04T22:47:00.000Z	fego	fellayaboy	why -iname ? just simply -name
2012-11-04T22:47:00.000Z	fellayaboy		just in case theres uppercases..i want find to ignore if its upper cases
2012-11-04T22:49:00.000Z	fego	fellayaboy	Recent versions of GNU find seem to have an -iname flag, for case-insensitive name search.
2012-11-04T22:50:00.000Z	fellayaboy		yeah exactly...if the file name is MyFile.txt ..using -iname myfile.txt will find MyFile.txt for me
2012-11-04T22:51:00.000Z	fego	fellayaboy	just in case,you wont be able to find the files that dont have required privileges from your user
2012-11-04T22:52:00.000Z	fellayaboy		but if i use sudo find / i will right?
2012-11-04T22:52:00.000Z	fego	fellayaboy	yes
2012-11-04T22:52:00.000Z	fellayaboy	fego	thats false cuz i used sudo and still its not going in deep
2012-11-04T22:53:00.000Z	fego	fellayaboy	everytime it works for me :D
2012-11-04T22:53:00.000Z	fego		wach time
2012-11-04T22:54:00.000Z	fego	fellayaboy	when you specify / to find, find automatically searches the subdirs too
