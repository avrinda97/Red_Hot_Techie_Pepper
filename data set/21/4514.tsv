2008-11-07T13:36:00.000Z	ay^	zetheroo	tell you where it might be
2008-11-07T13:37:00.000Z	zetheroo	ay^	I dunno ... all I get when I click the power button is Log Off and Switch User
2008-11-07T13:38:00.000Z	ay^	zetheroo	did you get the question about replacing the old menu?
2008-11-07T13:39:00.000Z	zetheroo	ay^	are you telling me to replace the old menu? ...
2008-11-07T13:39:00.000Z	ay^	zetheroo	no, I'm asking wether you got the question about replacing the old menu, but I take it that you did not.
2008-11-07T13:40:00.000Z	zetheroo	ay^	I just added an applet to the panel ... called Shut Down ... and when I click that one I get all the options

2008-11-07T13:41:00.000Z	zetheroo	ay^	is that what I was supposed to do ,,,,
2008-11-07T13:41:00.000Z	ay^	zetheroo	well, what did you want to do? If you wanted the menu, I suppose so. If your still talking about the question I got, then no.
2008-11-07T13:42:00.000Z	zetheroo	ay^	whats your question?
2008-11-07T13:42:00.000Z	zetheroo		btw .. does anyone know what to do if Ubuntu is telling me that the ATI drivers are active but not in use?
2008-11-07T13:42:00.000Z	ay^	zetheroo	my question? Do you mean the question the system asked me when I upgraded, or do you mean any question I might have about anything ubuntu-ish?
2008-11-07T13:43:00.000Z	zetheroo	ay^	ha ... I am just asking you if you had a question you wanted to ask me ...
2008-11-07T13:43:00.000Z	ay^	zetheroo	I cannot think of one, no. do you want me to? :)
2008-11-07T13:44:00.000Z	zetheroo	ay^	no worries... do you know anything about the ATI question I was asking?
2008-11-07T13:44:00.000Z	ay^	zetheroo	I don't know what that question was, but since I dont have a ATI, I will say no.
