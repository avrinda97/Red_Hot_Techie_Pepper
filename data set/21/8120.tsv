2006-06-08T12:30:00.000Z	rpaul		what would cause a file (folder) to not be able to be deleted, even as root?
2006-06-08T12:30:00.000Z	bimberi	rpaul	if it's immutable bit is set (see the chattr and lsattr commands)
2006-06-08T12:31:00.000Z	rpaul	bimberi	ok, i'll have a look.
2006-06-08T12:34:00.000Z	rpaul	bimberi	lsattr scalable/ -> lsattr: Inappropriate ioctl for device
2006-06-08T12:34:00.000Z	rpaul	bimberi	not sure what that means
2006-06-08T12:35:00.000Z	bimberi	rpaul	what sort of files are in scalable/ ?
2006-06-08T12:36:00.000Z	bimberi	rpaul	'file scalable/' will tell you
2006-06-08T12:36:00.000Z	bimberi	rpaul	err, 'file scalable/*'
2006-06-08T12:36:00.000Z	rpaul	bimberi	there are all directories
2006-06-08T12:36:00.000Z	rpaul	bimberi	all to do with icons
2006-06-08T12:37:00.000Z	rpaul	bimberi	ls -l /usr/share/icons/hicolor/scalable - you should have the same files i would imagine
2006-06-08T12:38:00.000Z	bimberi	rpaul	yep, 7 subdirectories (actions ... stock)
2006-06-08T12:39:00.000Z	rpaul	bimberi	lsattr shows thsi http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/15286
2006-06-08T12:39:00.000Z	bimberi	rpaul	and lsattr on that directory works fine here :/
2006-06-08T12:39:00.000Z	rpaul	bimberi	there is something wrong with my directory, not sure why.   my post on the forums for some background http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1080798#post1080798
2006-06-08T12:40:00.000Z	rpaul	bimberi	did you have a look at that pastebin?
2006-06-08T12:40:00.000Z	bimberi	rpaul	yep, looks ... interesting
2006-06-08T12:41:00.000Z	rpaul	bimberi	no idea?
2006-06-08T12:43:00.000Z	bimberi	rpaul	none sorry :(  (only knew about chattr making files undeleteable by root)
2006-06-08T12:43:00.000Z	rpaul	bimberi	ok, thanks for you help
2006-06-08T12:43:00.000Z	bimberi	rpaul	yw :) (such that it was)
