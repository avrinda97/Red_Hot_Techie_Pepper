2008-08-19T11:03:00.000Z	bobertdos	annie_g	Just find where it says UTC = yes, change it to no, save, and exit.
2008-08-19T11:04:00.000Z	annie_g	bobertdos	ok already did - have rcS(etc/default) - gedit - window open
2008-08-19T11:06:00.000Z	annie_g	bobertdos	ok did that and the oter text type window closed and came back to the term window - looks good so far
2008-08-19T11:06:00.000Z	bobertdos	annie_g	and you remembered to save?
2008-08-19T11:07:00.000Z	annie_g	bobertdos	yea - it should be edited and changed - do I need to do a reboot to check ?
2008-08-19T11:07:00.000Z	bobertdos	annie_g	Well, yeah, if you want to. That should fix the problem either way.
