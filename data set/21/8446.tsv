2006-04-12T08:00:00.000Z	harisund		Could someone tell me why Ubuntu decided to go with such an emphasis on Python, rather than traditional C? I mean, even gcc doesn't get installed, while the python interpreter and a million other python libraries get installed even in the server edition?

2006-04-12T08:03:00.000Z	crimsun	harisund	core design decision.
2006-04-12T08:03:00.000Z	harisund	crimsun	Meaning?
2006-04-12T08:03:00.000Z	crimsun	harisund	meaning a decision was made to encourage the use of Python
2006-04-12T08:04:00.000Z	harisund	crimsun	Encourage the use of Python? Hmm..any particular reason? Or is just that Mark Shuttleworth simply liked Python over C++?
2006-04-12T08:04:00.000Z	crimsun	harisund	a number of people prefer it to C. It also helps that our core dev team includes a Python maintainer.
2006-04-12T08:05:00.000Z	harisund	crimsun	Oh that makes more sense.. so I just guess c/c++ are merely dying away then..
2006-04-12T08:05:00.000Z	crimsun	harisund	hardly dying.
2006-04-12T08:06:00.000Z	harisund	crimsun	Hardly dying? So you are then basically saying that while both are given equal importance, Python gets preference and consequently is packaged default with Ubuntu while Gcc is still can be still obtained from the repos..
2006-04-12T08:08:00.000Z	crimsun	harisund	what was that question/statement?
2006-04-23T16:14:00.000Z	crimsun	harisund	you need them because glibc depends on them.
2006-04-23T16:15:00.000Z	crimsun	harisund	they are a specific set of headers that the kernel source provides.
2006-04-23T16:17:00.000Z	crimsun	harisund	don't worry about headers. Red herring.
2006-04-23T16:17:00.000Z	harisund	crimsun	I am going to take your word on that. FlannelKing: But are they even there? Perhaps they are present where I installed them from?
2006-04-29T10:45:00.000Z	crimsun	harisund	you'd enter that data into /etc/network/interfaces. man 5 interfaces
2006-04-29T10:46:00.000Z	harisund	crimsun	I know .. but man interfaces doesn't have any information for entering the dns details.
2006-04-29T10:46:00.000Z	crimsun	harisund	as for the dns servers, place those into /etc/resolv.conf
2006-04-29T10:46:00.000Z	harisund	crimsun	Ah smooth .. thanks a ton man !
2006-06-27T11:06:00.000Z	crimsun	harisund	that's the X.Org conffile, yes.
2006-06-27T11:06:00.000Z	harisund	crimsun	ok thank heavens..
