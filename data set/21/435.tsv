2012-04-15T07:34:00.000Z	keithclark_	bobo37773	still no luck even changing dns server to google
2012-04-15T07:37:00.000Z	bobo37773	keithclark_	Next thing I would try would be to access the ip from behind a proxy. I really don't see why all this is necessary though. What country are you in?
2012-04-15T07:37:00.000Z	keithclark_	bobo37773	Canada
2012-04-15T07:38:00.000Z	bobo37773	keithclark_	I am in the states and it is working here. Use a public us proxy and see of that works.
2012-04-15T07:38:00.000Z	keithclark_	bobo37773	this is turning into the biggest mystery
2012-04-15T07:39:00.000Z	keithclark_	bobo37773	all others in Canada seem to work
2012-04-15T07:39:00.000Z	bobo37773	keithclark_	It has been a while since I heard something this strange too.
2012-04-15T07:39:00.000Z	bobo37773	keithclark_	It worked?! What did? A proxy?
2012-04-15T07:40:00.000Z	keithclark_	bobo37773	nothing worked
2012-04-15T07:41:00.000Z	bobo37773	keithclark_	Oh. Did you try a US proxy?
2012-04-15T07:41:00.000Z	keithclark_	bobo37773	not sure how
2012-04-15T07:41:00.000Z	bobo37773	keithclark_	Do you have any other machines on your network? Can they access this ip?
2012-04-15T07:42:00.000Z	keithclark_	bobo37773	all computers have the same problem.  All running Ubuntu
2012-04-15T07:43:00.000Z	bobo37773	keithclark_	Send me the address again. I want to take a look at it. Also, send it as a domain (not the ip).
2012-04-15T07:45:00.000Z	keithclark_	bobo37773	http://www.skype.com
2012-04-15T07:47:00.000Z	bobo37773	keithclark_	What? Oh man. Yeah that is quite an interesting issue
2012-04-15T07:48:00.000Z	bobo37773	keithclark_	That domain redirects. Try this --> http://www.skype.com/intl/en-us/home
2012-04-15T07:49:00.000Z	keithclark_	bobo37773	timeout
2012-04-15T07:51:00.000Z	bobo37773	keithclark_	Something is blocking you. How about this --> 204.9.163.248:80
2012-04-15T07:51:00.000Z	keithclark_	bobo37773	nope, timeout
2012-04-15T07:55:00.000Z	bobo37773	keithclark_	I have no idea what to tell you now. Try a different web browser. Try a proxy. Make sure you do not have a firewall blocking you. Other than that I have no idea.
