2009-02-03T20:43:00.000Z	sue		How do I switch between KDM and Gnome? I had to install kdm to get past my login screen (faulty login screen theme), so what is the terminal command to switch?
2009-02-03T20:44:00.000Z	scunizi	sue	on the password screen change your session
2009-02-03T20:45:00.000Z	sue	scunizi	is there a command though?
2009-02-03T20:46:00.000Z	scunizi		sue there are 2 links there.. the second one describes how to do it.. there is no single command
2009-02-03T20:47:00.000Z	sue	scunizi	sorry, where are the links?
2009-02-03T20:48:00.000Z	scunizi		sue above. in ubottu's post
2009-02-03T20:49:00.000Z	sue	scunizi	sorry, your not making sense, I don't see any messages from ubottu.
2009-02-03T20:49:00.000Z	sue		:P

2009-02-03T20:49:00.000Z	scunizi		sue .. now do you see it?
2009-02-03T20:50:00.000Z	sue	scunizi	yes, but what does that have to do with KDM and Gnome?
2009-02-03T20:51:00.000Z	scunizi	sue	please read the link.. it has to do with ubuntu, kubuntu, xubuntu, linux etc.. gnome & kde don't have anything to do with it.
2009-02-03T20:56:00.000Z	sue	scunizi	so, If I want to switch between KDM and gnome, then why do I have to look at something about  "IPv4 and IPV6" connections??     I'm sorry, I guess I'll just ask someone else.
2009-02-03T20:59:00.000Z	scunizi	sue	My appologies.. I went back and saw where I got confused.. I was responding to the wrong nick with the wrong info.. sorry for the frustration.. on the login screen where you put your password there should be an Options button where you can change from gnome to kde
2009-02-03T21:00:00.000Z	sue	scunizi	That's fine, I was beginning to think you where crazy!
2009-02-03T21:00:00.000Z	sue		:)
2009-02-03T21:00:00.000Z	scunizi		sue.. :)
2009-02-03T21:01:00.000Z	scunizi	sue	kitche has the name right.. it's called sessions. in options
2009-02-03T21:03:00.000Z	sue	scunizi	Ok, the only problem is, my Gnome login window theme is faulty...So I need someway to change it without logging out.
2009-02-03T21:04:00.000Z	scunizi	sue	I'm afraid I'm going to defer that question to someone that knows the answer.. sorry I don't
2009-02-03T21:05:00.000Z	sue	scunizi	No problem, thank you very much for your help!
