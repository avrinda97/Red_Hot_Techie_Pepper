2004-12-30T14:44:00.000Z	melazyboy	Se7h	just out of curiosity try this, 'dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1024 count=5 | aplay'
2004-12-30T14:45:00.000Z	Se7h	melazyboy	wtf is that ?
2004-12-30T14:49:00.000Z	Se7h	melazyboy	erros of that like ?
2004-12-30T14:49:00.000Z	melazyboy	Se7h	Yes with applications bitching when they try to access a sudo file handle, like for instance /dev/dsp
2004-12-30T14:52:00.000Z	melazyboy	Se7h	I don't think thats true, i use gnome and xmms, VLC, and xine all access ALSA directly, they all have an option to play through artsd, but they in addition have an ALSA option, as in a menu where you can select one but not both, and i play to what i believe is alsa directly with artsd running
2004-12-30T14:53:00.000Z	Se7h	melazyboy	well...its there call not mine
2004-12-30T14:59:00.000Z	Se7h	melazyboy	yes i didd
2004-12-30T15:19:00.000Z	melazyboy	Se7h	gnome meeting
2004-12-30T15:21:00.000Z	melazyboy	Se7h	I think gnome meeting can communicate with netmeeting
2004-12-30T15:21:00.000Z	Se7h	melazyboy	yes it can
2004-12-30T15:22:00.000Z	melazyboy	Se7h	well i think because any app can communicate with netmeeting gnome meeting can communicate with any app..
2004-12-30T15:24:00.000Z	melazyboy	Se7h	firewall maybe"
