2007-01-28T16:11:00.000Z	variant	infidel	if it's damaged by DRM then you will have to strip the drm before playing it on anything other than windows (this may be illegal in your country)
2007-01-28T16:12:00.000Z	infidel	variant	how do i do that?
2007-01-28T16:12:00.000Z	variant	infidel	there are programs now for stripping the drm, check google
2007-01-28T16:12:00.000Z	variant	infidel	google for "wmv remove drm"
2007-01-28T16:13:00.000Z	infidel	variant	thank you
2007-01-28T16:13:00.000Z	variant	infidel	yw
2007-01-28T16:13:00.000Z	variant	infidel	I think the cvs version of vlc might have support for them but you might need to run it once on windows first before hand (that might be just a rumor i heard)
2007-01-28T16:14:00.000Z	infidel	variant	ok thanks
