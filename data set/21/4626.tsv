2008-08-14T20:49:00.000Z	Dillizar		i have put my HDD in a new MB and i have problems with the usb drivers how can i DL drivers?
2008-08-14T20:50:00.000Z	Slart	Dillizar	it's quite unusual to need usb drivers for hdd
2008-08-14T20:51:00.000Z	Dillizar	Slart	no cuz my hdd with ubuntu is on a new MB i need drivers for my new MB
2008-08-14T20:52:00.000Z	Slart	Dillizar	ok, now I understand.. well.. it's still kind of unusal.. most motherboard stuff usually works without separate drivers... what makes you think it's a driver problem?
2008-08-14T20:53:00.000Z	Dillizar	Slart	cuz i cant put usb :) dunno
2008-08-14T20:53:00.000Z	Slart	Dillizar	look in dmesg and /var/log/syslog for errors..
2008-08-14T20:55:00.000Z	Dillizar	Slart	cuz few weeks ago i had to dl some drivers. but i didnt
2008-08-14T20:57:00.000Z	Slart	Dillizar	well.. lets see what those logs tell us.. can you pastebin them?
2008-10-10T02:32:00.000Z	Slart	Dillizar	/dev/dsp and /dev/audio?
2008-10-10T02:32:00.000Z	Slart	Dillizar	tell us about this problem
2008-10-10T02:35:00.000Z	Slart	Dillizar	I think /dev/audio and /dev/dsp is used by oss, the older sound system that predates alsa..
2008-10-12T00:39:00.000Z	Slart	Dillizar	nothing in the repos?
2008-10-12T00:40:00.000Z	Slart	Dillizar	I think it's called seamonkey these days.. if you mean the old mozilla browser
2008-11-17T18:00:00.000Z	Slart	Dillizar	since you asked like that I assume you're not experienced with packaging.. or?
2008-11-17T18:00:00.000Z	Slart	Dillizar	what do you want to do?
2008-11-17T18:01:00.000Z	Dillizar	Slart	i am trying to install JMF
2008-11-17T18:02:00.000Z	Slart	Dillizar	and why do you need to create a deb from a bin-file?
2008-11-17T18:03:00.000Z	Dillizar	Slart	cuz when i install it like bin it cant be installed i dont know i want to try the easyest way deb :P
2008-11-17T18:04:00.000Z	Slart	Dillizar	the reason a deb is easier is because someone else has done a lot of the hard work.. you can't just run a command and convert it
2008-11-17T18:05:00.000Z	Slart	Dillizar	you'd be better off trying to install it from the bin file.. if it isn't already available in the repos but I guess you've checked that
