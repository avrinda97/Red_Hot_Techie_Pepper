2010-09-18T16:38:00.000Z	blue112		What can I do to solve the black moving stripes problem with Flash Player on 10.04 (an probably before) ? Looks like a vertical synchro problem.
2010-09-18T16:40:00.000Z	juk	blue112	where you watch movies, give me link to check
2010-09-18T16:42:00.000Z	blue112	juk	it's not on movies, it's on games. I'd like to make a video or a screen capture, but I can't : On the screen capture everything is normal, and when I try to make a video it slows down my computer so much I can't do anything.
2010-09-18T16:42:00.000Z	blue112	juk	it happens on embedded youtube videos, for instance (every one).
2010-09-18T16:43:00.000Z	juk	blue112	hang on, you making video?
