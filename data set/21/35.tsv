2012-11-25T01:48:00.000Z	Jaclyn		So. Do you have any idea why my USB port would do that? It was working just fine before I upgraded.
2012-11-25T01:50:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Jaclyn	if you run lsusb , does it show ?
2012-11-25T01:52:00.000Z	Jaclyn		It shows 5. I have three USB ports, a card slot, and A CF slot. Do you think the other two are those?
2012-11-25T01:54:00.000Z	Jaclyn	BluesKaj	It shows five.
2012-11-25T01:54:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Jaclyn	can you paste the output in pastebin
2012-11-25T01:54:00.000Z	Jaclyn		k

2012-11-25T01:59:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Jaclyn	that looks very normal , perhaps your mouse only works with USB2.0 , the others appear to be the older USB version 1.1
2012-11-25T02:00:00.000Z	Jaclyn		No
2012-11-25T02:01:00.000Z	Jaclyn		The mouse works with all USB ports
2012-11-25T02:01:00.000Z	Jaclyn		In fact I usually plug it into that port
2012-11-25T02:01:00.000Z	Jaclyn		.-.
2012-11-25T02:02:00.000Z	Jaclyn	BluesKaj	my mouse is just a standard Dell wired mouse. You know, the old indestructable kind that's the same as a PS2 mouse except it's usb
2012-11-25T02:03:00.000Z	Jaclyn		And if that was the case, how come my USB storage devices and keyboard don't work in that port either?
2012-11-25T02:04:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Jaclyn	are all the other usb ports occupied , if not try eqach one
2012-11-25T02:05:00.000Z	Jaclyn	BluesKaj	all of the other ones work
2012-11-25T02:17:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Jaclyn	the only thing I can think of is, that one USB port has lost power from the power supply connection , you'll just have to use one of the others
2012-11-25T02:17:00.000Z	Jaclyn		Umm
2012-11-25T02:17:00.000Z	Jaclyn	BluesKaj	No. It still has power to it.
2012-11-25T02:19:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Jaclyn	did you try a stick or something on it ?
2012-11-25T02:19:00.000Z	Jaclyn	BluesKaj	I plugged an external fan into it.
