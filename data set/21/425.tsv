2011-12-28T16:25:00.000Z	Duker		How can I run a .sh program from a second drive?
2011-12-28T16:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Duker	mark the file as executable
2011-12-28T16:26:00.000Z	Duker	ActionParsnip	Thanks
2011-12-28T16:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Duker	cmod +x file.sh   is all it needs
2011-12-28T16:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Duker	no output == good news
2011-12-28T16:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Duker	is the file stored on an ntfs partition?
2011-12-28T16:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Duker	that's why then
2011-12-28T16:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Duker	you will nee to mount the entire partition as executable for it to be runable, or you can copy it to the Linux partition and mark it as executable there
2011-12-28T16:45:00.000Z	Duker	ActionParsnip	so ext4 also?
2011-12-28T16:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Duker	yes, same difference
2011-12-28T16:45:00.000Z	Duker	ActionParsnip	ty
2011-12-28T22:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Duker	make everyone a normal user then add the ones you want to give sudo access to the 'admin' group. You could chown the script to a group so that only users in a different group can run the command if you wish
2011-12-28T22:18:00.000Z	Duker	ActionParsnip	Thanks1
2011-12-28T22:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Duker	obviously those in teh admin group will be able to run it with sudo
2011-12-28T22:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Duker	yes as the command will be running as user rather than root, i'd check in a minecraft channel to see if this is appropriate
2011-12-28T23:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Duker	users in the 'admin' group have 100% system access via gk/sudo
2011-12-28T23:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Duker	there should be a user manager or ni cli you can use usermod or useradd
2011-12-28T23:31:00.000Z	Duker	ActionParsnip	Thanks
2011-12-28T23:32:00.000Z	Duker	ActionParsnip	Only has the standard and admin groups, is there a way I could change standard permissions to everything except sudo?
2011-12-28T23:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Duker	chown -R      will recursively chown
2011-12-28T23:47:00.000Z	Duker	ActionParsnip	Thanks
