2007-04-01T11:05:00.000Z	xtknight		compression ratio rather
2007-04-01T11:05:00.000Z	xtknight		not sure about that
2007-04-01T11:05:00.000Z	xtknight		i think gz is faster
2007-04-01T11:06:00.000Z	xtknight		not sure actually
2007-04-01T11:06:00.000Z	xtknight		it's a bash builtin it seems

2007-04-01T11:08:00.000Z	jack_deltrino	xtknight	I already asked a question....
2007-04-01T11:08:00.000Z	xtknight	jack_deltrino	please repeat it.  some people are lazy :P
2007-04-01T11:08:00.000Z	jack_deltrino	xtknight	But apparently it's been lost in a flurry of text...
2007-04-01T11:09:00.000Z	xtknight	jack_deltrino	specify sometihng different after --port= ?
2007-04-01T11:09:00.000Z	jack_deltrino	xtknight	What...?
2007-04-01T11:09:00.000Z	xtknight	jack_deltrino	you had --port=10000. that uses port 10000.  if you want antoher port specify another port.  or did i misunderstand you?
2007-04-01T11:10:00.000Z	jack_deltrino	xtknight	You totally misunderstood me. How do I use port 10000 instead of 22 (default)
2007-04-01T11:12:00.000Z	xtknight	jack_deltrino	still beyond confused.  --port is the right way to do it for the rsync daemon
2007-04-01T11:12:00.000Z	xtknight	jack_deltrino	if it's not working i'm not sure, sorry
2007-04-01T11:12:00.000Z	xtknight	jack_deltrino	i believe port is only for a daemon, that is, if you are hosting.
2007-04-01T11:12:00.000Z	jack_deltrino	xtknight	Client...
2007-04-01T11:13:00.000Z	xtknight	jack_deltrino	actually for Client... --port=PORT             specify double-colon alternate port number   it sounds like it needs something special
2007-04-01T11:14:00.000Z	jack_deltrino	xtknight	Yeah, I read the man page already, that's why I'm here.
2007-04-01T11:14:00.000Z	jack_deltrino	xtknight	This doesn't seem all that special. People run SSHd on nonstandard ports for extra (albeit small amount of) security
