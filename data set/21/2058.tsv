2012-05-10T06:10:00.000Z	Aboba		I have a wierd problem, Rhythmbox will play an MP3 that I cannot get ANY other piece of software to play
2012-05-10T06:10:00.000Z	Aboba		How do I find out what kind of problem is causing this?
2012-05-10T06:11:00.000Z	apn	Aboba	are other gstreamer based players refusing to play as well?
2012-05-10T06:12:00.000Z	Aboba	apn	checking
2012-05-10T06:12:00.000Z	Aboba		okay, looks like they do
2012-05-10T06:12:00.000Z	Aboba		banshee, and movie player both work
2012-05-10T06:12:00.000Z	Aboba		VLC does not
2012-05-10T06:12:00.000Z	Aboba		nor does any sort of mp3 conversion software
2012-05-10T06:12:00.000Z	apn	Aboba	looks like you have some missing dependencies for vlc
2012-05-10T06:13:00.000Z	Aboba		audacity also cannot open the file
2012-05-10T06:13:00.000Z	apn	Aboba	open vlc in terminal, it should display error in the background
2012-05-10T06:13:00.000Z	Aboba		which is what I'm really trying to do
2012-05-10T06:15:00.000Z	Aboba	apn	no error in background when run from terminal
2012-05-10T06:16:00.000Z	apn	Aboba	tough cookie.  SoundConverter runs on top of gstreamer, so it will convert to mp3 as needed.  But it does not solve the problem. Is it only specific mp3s, or all of them?
2012-05-10T06:16:00.000Z	Aboba		It's one particular mp3
2012-05-10T06:16:00.000Z	Aboba		going to try soundconverter
2012-05-10T06:17:00.000Z	apn	Aboba	then something is wrong with the file, not software.  Good luck.
2012-05-10T06:19:00.000Z	Aboba	apn	used soundconverter to go to wav, then back to mp3, not it works
2012-05-10T06:21:00.000Z	Aboba	apn	sorry, now it works
2012-05-10T06:21:00.000Z	Aboba	apn	thanks
2012-05-10T06:21:00.000Z	apn	Aboba	great. No problem.
