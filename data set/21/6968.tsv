2009-01-11T03:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	spasticteapot	yes
2009-01-20T01:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	spasticteapot	create mount point and mount the device to that point
2009-01-20T01:24:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	spasticteapot	sudo mkdir /media/drive4you then sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/drive4you substitute your drive for sda1
2009-01-20T01:25:00.000Z	spasticteapot	Jack_Sparrow	Sweet!
2009-01-20T01:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	spasticteapot	np
2009-01-20T01:26:00.000Z	spasticteapot	Jack_Sparrow	Is there a way I can do this permanently?
2009-01-20T01:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	spasticteapot	edit fstab and it will mount perm
2009-01-20T01:27:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	spasticteapot	mounts you create in /media will appear on your desktop but can be turned off if you so desire
2009-01-20T01:27:00.000Z	spasticteapot	Jack_Sparrow	Each entry in fstab has a UUID. I do not know the UUID of this volume. I'm not entirely sure of what a UUID is.
2009-01-20T01:31:00.000Z	spasticteapot	Jack_Sparrow	So, in /etc/fstab, I should put 2 under the Pass column, and put the mount at /media/music?
2009-01-20T01:32:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	spasticteapot	ONe sec
2009-01-20T01:33:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	spasticteapot	sudo apt-get install pastebinit  && cp /etc/fstab ~/Desktop/Partition_Layout.txt && sudo fdisk -l >> ~/Desktop/Partition_Layout.txt && lsb_release -a >> ~/Desktop/Partition_Layout.txt && cat /home/$USER/Desktop/Partition_Layout.txt | pastebinit                   (Provide Pastebin link in channel)
2009-01-20T01:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	spasticteapot	6 is root 7 is home so it would be sda3 that you are after
2009-01-20T01:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	spasticteapot	So what is the question.. what should your fstab be changed to..  And we should also create a mount point that has meaning for you  not my generic one
2009-01-20T01:40:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	spasticteapot	gimme a minute please

2009-01-20T01:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	spasticteapot	gksudo gedit /etc/fstab
2009-01-20T01:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	spasticteapot	Did you get that.. dont forget to create thaT MOUNT POINT
2009-01-20T01:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	spasticteapot	mount -a in a term
2009-01-20T01:46:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	spasticteapot	that looks  fine to me
