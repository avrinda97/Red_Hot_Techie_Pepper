2012-10-15T14:41:00.000Z	Eagleman		When i use this script: http://pastebin.com/FuAHG3wa in rc.local it says:  /etc/rc.local: 15: /etc/rc.local: Syntax error: "fi" unexpected (expecting "then")   How do i correctly use it?
2012-10-15T14:43:00.000Z	Eagleman		That was slow :O
2012-10-15T14:43:00.000Z	schnuffle	Eagleman	its if [expression]; then [your code] fi
2012-10-15T14:53:00.000Z	schnuffle	Eagleman	just add the then before the rm line
2012-10-15T14:54:00.000Z	Eagleman	schnuffle	like this? http://pastebin.com/MAxAxjR4
2012-10-15T14:59:00.000Z	schnuffle	Eagleman	the then needs to be before the rm line

2012-10-15T15:04:00.000Z	Eagleman	schnuffle	it is like this now: http://pastebin.com/bZ736bZ0
2012-10-15T15:06:00.000Z	schnuffle	Eagleman	won'T work the expression is tottaly wrong  if [ -e /opt/ts3/ts3server.pid]; then rm /opt/ts3/ts3server.pid; su teamspeak -c "/opt/ts3/ts3server_startscript.sh start"; fi
2012-10-15T15:07:00.000Z	schnuffle	Eagleman	 yes and there'S a space missing before the closing bracket of the expression
2012-10-15T15:08:00.000Z	schnuffle	Eagleman	you should update your shell knowledge if you do such tasks more often. just check the link I gave you
2012-10-15T15:09:00.000Z	Eagleman	schnuffle	i rather dont do it but sometimes i have to, also which space is missing i dont see any
2012-10-15T15:10:00.000Z	schnuffle	Eagleman	if [ -e /opt/ts3/ts3server.pid ]; <- now there'S a space before the bracket which was missing
2012-10-15T15:14:00.000Z	schnuffle	Eagleman	failsafe? no and why don'T you test it before? what means failsafe in that context. failsafe would be to start teamspeak with a proper init script and setup a monitoring that cares about restart when tramspeak crashes
2012-10-15T15:16:00.000Z	Eagleman	schnuffle	thats how how teamspeak was created, if i run it as root everything is fine becuase the ts3.pid file belongs to the root user, but when i run it as teamspeak and my server crashes it is unable to delete the fail when trying to start teamspeak
2012-10-15T15:17:00.000Z	schnuffle	Eagleman	 which distribution and which teamspeak version?

2012-10-15T15:19:00.000Z	Eagleman	schnuffle	thats also starts as root

2012-10-15T15:21:00.000Z	Eagleman	schnuffle	they are all custom made, the only problem i have with the normal start stop file is the .pid file after a crash but thats solved now
2012-10-15T15:22:00.000Z	schnuffle	Eagleman	just some hints. I prefer having init script for upstart/sys v for services that I run on my system and custom made isnt't bad
