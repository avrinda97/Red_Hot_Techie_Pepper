2006-01-16T11:07:00.000Z	warpforge		gladiator: tell me about any conflicts
2006-01-16T11:09:00.000Z	warpforge		gladiator: you have nothing to worry about. ubuntu-desktop is only a meta-package
2006-01-16T11:09:00.000Z	warpforge		gladiator: removing ubuntu-desktop won't remove anything
2006-01-16T11:10:00.000Z	warpforge		gladiator: removing and readding it can sometimes show conflicts
