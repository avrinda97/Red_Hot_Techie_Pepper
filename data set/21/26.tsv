2004-09-27T11:05:00.000Z	tory		I just finished installing ubuntu. Aside from the name, I'm in love :-)
2004-09-27T11:05:00.000Z	tory		This is honestly the greatest distro I've ever tried. It's like debian but it actually works right out of the box.
2004-09-27T11:06:00.000Z	jdub	tory	cool!
2004-09-27T11:06:00.000Z	tory	jdub	another nice thing is that the menus are simple to use
2004-09-27T11:07:00.000Z	jdub	tory	no crap! :)
2004-09-27T11:07:00.000Z	jdub	tory	i mean, there isn't any crap,. hrm ;)
2004-09-27T11:08:00.000Z	jdub	tory	i think they are available in universe
2004-09-27T11:08:00.000Z	tory	jdub	ok
2004-09-27T11:10:00.000Z	jdub	tory	actually, msttcorefonts is not there, i'll check why
2004-09-27T11:11:00.000Z	jdub	tory	you can add debian's contrib/non-free lines, they work reasonably well (not a lot of dependency issues tehre... ;)
2004-09-28T09:14:00.000Z	jdub	tory	we're looking at including mono in our next release
2004-09-28T09:14:00.000Z	jdub	tory	tseng has done some bleeding edge mono packages for warty too
2004-09-28T09:17:00.000Z	jdub	tory	didn't want the amd64 version?
2004-09-28T09:17:00.000Z	tory	jdub	I tried it out but it had gnome 2.72 and some other stuff
2004-09-30T06:59:00.000Z	jdub	tory	;)
2004-09-30T06:59:00.000Z	tory	jdub	what

2004-09-30T07:01:00.000Z	tory	jdub	do you know of any other decent weather applet so I can know whether or not its raining without having to take my eyes off of the screen for more than half a second?
2004-09-30T07:01:00.000Z	jdub	tory	if it's raining, it will show rain
2004-09-30T07:01:00.000Z	tory	jdub	yeah, but I mean one besides the one gnome comes with
2004-09-30T11:58:00.000Z	jdub	tory	niiiiiice
