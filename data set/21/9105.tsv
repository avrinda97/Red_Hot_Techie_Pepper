2006-01-28T08:41:00.000Z	imexius		sudo nvidia-glx
2006-01-28T08:41:00.000Z	imexius		sudo nvidia-glx-config enable
2006-01-28T08:41:00.000Z	Razor-X	imexius	yes, I have nvidia-glx installed
2006-01-28T08:41:00.000Z	Razor-X	imexius	and yes, it's enabled
2006-01-28T08:41:00.000Z	Razor-X	imexius	but when I tell my xorg.conf to use ``nvidia'' device instead of ``nv'', it hangs
2006-01-28T08:42:00.000Z	Razor-X	imexius	yes
2006-01-28T08:42:00.000Z	Razor-X	imexius	I rebotted my X server and the machine
2006-01-28T08:43:00.000Z	imexius	Razor-X	you should have to manually change it, it should alrady be "nvidia"
2006-01-28T08:43:00.000Z	imexius	Razor-X	shouldn't
2006-01-28T08:44:00.000Z	Razor-X	imexius	ah, heh
2006-01-28T08:44:00.000Z	Razor-X	imexius	well, it says ``nv'' on mine, glxgears does nothing
2006-01-28T08:45:00.000Z	imexius	Razor-X	when you say it hangs when you try to change it what do you mean? Like when your saving yoru xorg.conf?
2006-01-28T08:45:00.000Z	Razor-X	imexius	no, xorg.conf is edited fine, I either try ``startx'' or ``sudo /etc/init.d/kdm restart'' and it doesen't work
2006-01-28T08:46:00.000Z	Razor-X	imexius	if I use ``nv'', it works fine, but glxgears simply segfaults
2006-01-28T08:50:00.000Z	Razor-X	imexius	I type in ``glxgears'', it returns ``zsh: segmentation fault glxgears''
2006-01-28T08:52:00.000Z	Razor-X	imexius	a shitty Nvidia TNT2 RIVA Pro 64
2006-01-28T08:53:00.000Z	Razor-X	imexius	it worked in Hoary, Breezy seems to have broken this
2006-01-28T08:54:00.000Z	Razor-X	imexius	ah, that comes later
2006-01-28T08:55:00.000Z	Razor-X	imexius	after you have it mounted, try a ``cat /etc/mtab'' and copy the line that deals with your HDD straight into fstab
2006-01-28T08:55:00.000Z	Razor-X	imexius	I find it the easiest way to work
2006-01-28T08:58:00.000Z	Razor-X	imexius	I never really read about fstab, I just copied the line straight from my mtab :)
