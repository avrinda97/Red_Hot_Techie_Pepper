2007-06-11T06:12:00.000Z	dhuv	lengend	what do you mean not working, what have you tried?
2007-06-11T06:13:00.000Z	dhuv	lengend	you need to tell it what to install
2007-06-11T06:14:00.000Z	dhuv	lengend	type "sudo /sbin/ifconfig -a" into a terminal and let me know if you see eth0 and eth1
2007-06-11T06:16:00.000Z	dhuv	lengend	where are you checking for wlan
2007-06-11T06:50:00.000Z	dhuv	lengend	still trying to fix the wlan problem?
2007-06-11T06:51:00.000Z	dhuv	lengend	does iwconfig show an interface that has wireless extensions?
2007-06-11T06:52:00.000Z	lengend	dhuv	eth1 is wireless
2007-06-11T06:53:00.000Z	dhuv	lengend	does it has a mac address after Access Point: ?
2007-06-11T06:53:00.000Z	lengend	dhuv	no
2007-06-11T06:54:00.000Z	dhuv	lengend	you are using commands? like "iwconfig eth1 essid somenetwork ap auto"?
2007-06-11T06:55:00.000Z	dhuv	lengend	then what have you tried
2007-06-11T06:57:00.000Z	dhuv	lengend	personally I would try a wireless network management app to connect, it will save the profile and automatically connect to networks when you move from one location to another
2007-06-11T06:57:00.000Z	lengend	dhuv	which program would i use?
2007-06-11T06:57:00.000Z	dhuv	lengend	you use gnome?
2007-06-11T06:59:00.000Z	dhuv	lengend	you can try wifi-radar
2007-06-11T06:59:00.000Z	dhuv	lengend	how are you on irc?
2007-06-11T07:01:00.000Z	dhuv	lengend	can you hook it up with a network cable or no?
2007-06-11T07:02:00.000Z	dhuv	lengend	you want to try the command line first?
