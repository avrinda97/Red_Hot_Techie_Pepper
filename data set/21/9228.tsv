2005-10-21T08:30:00.000Z	nicedreams		I'm getting     libdvdread: Could not open /dev/dvd with libdvdcss    when trying to play a dvd with xine.  What could be wrong?
2005-10-21T08:30:00.000Z	sn9	nicedreams	do you have that symlink?
2005-10-21T08:32:00.000Z	nicedreams	sn9	what should it be linked to?
2005-10-21T08:32:00.000Z	sn9	nicedreams	whatever your dvd device is
2005-10-21T08:33:00.000Z	nicedreams	sn9	how would I check?   I typed  'ls -l /dev/dvd' and got   /dev/dvd -> hdd
2005-10-21T08:34:00.000Z	sn9	nicedreams	is your dvd drive secondary slave?
2005-10-21T08:35:00.000Z	nicedreams	sn9	yes
2005-10-21T08:39:00.000Z	nicedreams	sn9	this is my line for my dvd/cdrom drive from fstab        /dev/hdd      /media/cdrom0      udf,iso9660 ro,user,noauto   0     0
2005-10-21T08:39:00.000Z	sn9	nicedreams	you put in a dvd and launched xine, and got an error?
2005-10-21T08:40:00.000Z	nicedreams	sn9	I put in a dvd and typed      'xine -pfhq -V xv --auto-scan dvd'    to try it out before I try it with mythtv
2005-10-21T08:41:00.000Z	sn9	nicedreams	what about just xine dvd://
2005-10-21T08:42:00.000Z	nicedreams	sn9	when I type that I now get     xine engine error  There is no input plugin available to handle 'dvd://'  Maybe MRL syntax is wrong or file/stream source doesn't exist.
2005-10-21T08:43:00.000Z	nicedreams	sn9	I get the same error when trying to play a dvd through the GUI
2005-10-21T08:47:00.000Z	nicedreams	sn9	any other idea?
2005-10-21T08:47:00.000Z	sn9	nicedreams	does mplayer work?
2005-10-21T08:48:00.000Z	nicedreams	sn9	what do i type to try it in mplayer.  i have mplayer-k6 installed
2005-10-21T08:49:00.000Z	nicedreams	sn9	i tried from gmplayer and says      Couldn't open DVD device: /dev/dvd
2005-10-21T08:49:00.000Z	sn9	nicedreams	what permissions are on /dev/hdd?
2005-10-21T08:51:00.000Z	nicedreams	sn9	you know what?  I loged in as the first user I created on the install which is 'ken' and it works.  I was trying from being logged in as user 'mythtv'.  How can I get it to work for my mythtv user?
2005-10-21T08:53:00.000Z	nicedreams	sn9	I figured it out.  I had to put the 'mythtv' user in the cdrom group and now it works
2005-10-21T08:53:00.000Z	nicedreams	sn9	thx for the help for getting me to figure it out
