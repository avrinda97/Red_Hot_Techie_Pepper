2011-06-09T08:19:00.000Z	chazz_tsc1	julie	The key to my mind here is "_eventually_ segfaults". Points to an occasional error, which often is memory...
2011-06-09T08:20:00.000Z	julie	chazz_tsc1	a segmentation fault is an error generated by the OS to protect overall memory integrity, it is not hardware related
2011-06-09T08:21:00.000Z	chazz_tsc1	julie	Yes. No question. I'm thinking collateral damage, however; once memory starts messing up, anything can happen.
2011-06-09T08:25:00.000Z	julie	chazz_tsc1	the difference between a console and terminal is really a negligeable technicality, consoles are even called pseudo-terminals
2011-06-09T08:27:00.000Z	chazz_tsc1	julie	so why do I have to log in to c/a/f2 when I'm already logged in to c/a/f7? There is no X screen associated with c/a/f2, which is why x commands don't work there...
2011-06-09T08:30:00.000Z	julie	chazz_tsc1	I don't get your point...  c/a/f* are all different pseudo-ttys (or consoles as you may call)
2011-06-09T08:30:00.000Z	julie	chazz_tsc1	nothing stops you from calling an X command from a different tty
2011-06-09T08:32:00.000Z	chazz_tsc1	julie	How to explain? Calling an x command on tty2 will not affect the xserv on tty7. I believe ubuntu starts x only on tty7 ordinarily.
2011-06-09T08:33:00.000Z	chazz_tsc1	julie	also, I believe I can log in as different users on tty2 and tty3 for instance
2011-06-09T08:33:00.000Z	julie	chazz_tsc1	set your DISPLAY variable properly on any tty and calling an X command will open in your X
2011-06-09T08:33:00.000Z	julie	chazz_tsc1	you can log in as a different user
2011-06-09T08:33:00.000Z	julie	chazz_tsc1	these are different pseudo terminals
2011-06-09T08:34:00.000Z	chazz_tsc1	julie	yes. I would not want my xserv on tty7 to be affected by what someone on tty2 does...
2011-06-09T08:35:00.000Z	julie	chazz_tsc1	the X server rules are IP based, not tty based
2011-06-09T08:37:00.000Z	chazz_tsc1	julie	if you don't have x actually running on tty2, trying to run something that expects gui will fail with "can't get screen". That's what was happening with ubentobox.
2011-06-09T08:38:00.000Z	julie	chazz_tsc1	just try it instead of pointlessly arguing.... "export DISPLAY=YOUR-IP:0.0" and then type "xterm"
2011-06-09T08:40:00.000Z	chazz_tsc1	julie	did that, earlier today, without the export step. thing is, ubentobox would have gotten the same desktop he has on tty7 if he had exported.
2011-06-09T08:41:00.000Z	chazz_tsc1	julie	and he would have again been unable to set resolution. What worked for me was editing xconf with nano directly which can be done from a non-gui tty
2011-06-09T08:41:00.000Z	julie	chazz_tsc1	the export part is just part of the current shell's environement and not related to the whole machine
2011-06-09T08:41:00.000Z	julie	chazz_tsc1	you are right about editing the settings, but I'm following you less and less
2011-06-09T08:42:00.000Z	chazz_tsc1	julie	pas de probleme... we've strayed pretty far afield. I propose we leave it alone.
