2008-05-03T06:42:00.000Z	jlc		I am trying to install lightscribe drivers and get the error "wrong archetecture i386"  Any idea what the problem is
2008-05-03T06:42:00.000Z	Wyzard	jlc	Are you running amd64 Ubuntu?
2008-05-03T06:43:00.000Z	jlc	Wyzard	I right click on it and select open with Gdebipackage installer
2008-05-03T06:43:00.000Z	Wyzard	jlc	The message means either than you're running amd64 and trying to install an i386 package, or running i386 and trying to install an amd64 package (not sure which)
2008-05-03T06:43:00.000Z	jlc	Wyzard	yes running AMD64 Ubuntu.
2008-05-03T06:44:00.000Z	Wyzard	jlc	You can't install an i386 .deb on amd64 Ubuntu...  do they have an amd64 .deb?
2008-05-03T06:44:00.000Z	jlc	Wyzard	guess not, any idea where to get it?
2008-05-03T06:45:00.000Z	Wyzard	jlc	same place you got the i386 one, I guess
2008-05-03T06:45:00.000Z	jlc	Wyzard	not one there and I need my lightscribe.

2008-05-03T06:47:00.000Z	Wyzard	jlc	hmm, nevermind, that's outdated
2008-05-03T06:47:00.000Z	jlc	Wyzard	ty, will try it.
2008-05-03T06:47:00.000Z	Wyzard	jlc	anyway, the Lightscribe driver for Linux is closed-source, I believe
2008-05-03T06:47:00.000Z	jlc	Wyzard	ok
2008-05-03T06:47:00.000Z	jlc	Wyzard	meaning???
2008-05-03T06:47:00.000Z	Wyzard	jlc	meaning that if they don't provide an amd64 version of it, there's nothing you can do about it
2008-05-03T06:49:00.000Z	jlc	Wyzard	any idea who might be able to adapt it, re-write it...
2008-05-03T06:49:00.000Z	Wyzard	jlc	the company that provides it; they're the only ones who have the source code
2008-05-03T06:50:00.000Z	jlc	Wyzard	I might be able to reverse engineer it
2008-05-03T06:50:00.000Z	Wyzard	jlc	If you have experience doing that sort of thing, feel free, and document what you find
2008-05-03T06:51:00.000Z	jlc	Wyzard	I just don't know what to change.
