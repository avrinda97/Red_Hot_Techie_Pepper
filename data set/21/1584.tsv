2010-10-26T18:59:00.000Z	azertyu		ok what should contain the /tmp folder ?
2010-10-26T19:00:00.000Z	azertyu		normally
2010-10-26T19:00:00.000Z	tensorpudding	azertyu	/tmp is full of temporary files
2010-10-26T19:01:00.000Z	tensorpudding	azertyu	sockets used for IPC, for the most part
2010-10-26T19:02:00.000Z	tensorpudding	azertyu	but it's also a place for dumping temporary text and data
2010-10-26T19:02:00.000Z	tensorpudding	azertyu	basically anything which is not permanent, that needs to be accessible to programs
2010-10-26T19:03:00.000Z	tensorpudding	azertyu	define what you mean by using it for backup
2010-10-26T19:03:00.000Z	tensorpudding	azertyu	all the files on it get purged on reboot, so if you meant using it for storage it's the antithesis of a good idea
2010-10-26T19:09:00.000Z	tensorpudding	azertyu	there's lots of data in /tmp when you startup, because lots of programs use it
2010-10-26T19:09:00.000Z	tensorpudding	azertyu	for instance, pulseaudio, that starts at boot
2010-10-26T19:10:00.000Z	tensorpudding	azertyu	but even if it wasn't purged, storing those files there is inappropriate
2010-10-26T19:10:00.000Z	tensorpudding	azertyu	or at least, as inappropriate as storing them any old place on the filesystem
2010-10-26T19:11:00.000Z	tensorpudding	azertyu	http://ubuntu-tutorials.com/2008/01/19/changing-the-tmp-cleanup-frequency/ configures the frequency that tmp is dumped
