2008-01-11T08:32:00.000Z	nickrud	Skapare	the config that was used is in /boot/config ...  oh
2008-01-11T08:32:00.000Z	Skapare	nickrud	can you access it from yours?
2008-01-11T08:33:00.000Z	nickrud	Skapare	yes, I can put it up on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2008-01-11T08:33:00.000Z	nickrud	Skapare	it's for the 64bit version though
2008-01-11T08:33:00.000Z	Skapare	nickrud	I would need it as a file, not a decorated paste
2008-01-11T08:33:00.000Z	nickrud	Skapare	just copy the text box below
2008-01-11T08:33:00.000Z	Skapare	nickrud	OK, I'll try that
2008-01-11T08:34:00.000Z	nickrud	Skapare	but if you're using 32big, mine's not going to be quite right
2008-01-11T08:34:00.000Z	Skapare	nickrud	you're on 64 bit?
2008-01-11T08:34:00.000Z	nickrud	Skapare	yes
2008-01-11T08:34:00.000Z	Skapare	nickrud	well I could try 64 bit ... I have a pair of 2.8 GHz Opterons
2008-01-11T08:35:00.000Z	nickrud	Skapare	its worked well for me, the only issue I've had is java in browsers, don't miss it.
2008-01-11T08:37:00.000Z	nickrud	Skapare	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/51524/
2008-01-11T08:42:00.000Z	Skapare	nickrud	thanks ... took me a while to get it saved ... that paste site names the files ending in "/" in the URL and that seems to confuse lynx
2008-01-11T08:43:00.000Z	Skapare	nickrud	is that the way it comes from ubuntu?  alphabetized?
2008-01-11T08:43:00.000Z	nickrud	Skapare	yup, just like that. A lot of it is autogenerated
2008-01-11T08:44:00.000Z	Skapare	nickrud	I see ... I need the options organized by section so I can see the processor type section :-(
2008-01-11T08:44:00.000Z	nickrud	Skapare	and I assume you're not ready for make menuconfig yet
2008-01-11T08:45:00.000Z	Skapare	nickrud	the problem I run into is when I try to use my own kernel, it says the CPU numbers are 67, 68, 69, 70 ... when they should be 0, 1, 2, 3 ... but the Ubuntu kernel gets past that part OK
2008-01-11T08:46:00.000Z	nickrud	Skapare	lol, you must have missed my comment about following the kernel. When the stable branch became a development branch, I decided to leave it to the developers. My last kernel compile was 2.6.3 or so
2008-02-23T09:17:00.000Z	nickrud	Skapare	clueful user
