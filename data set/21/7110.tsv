2009-05-26T00:40:00.000Z	Dmole		I was HACKED and am looking for help sorting out what happened
2009-05-26T00:41:00.000Z	Dmole		sorry but it's surprising
2009-05-26T00:41:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Dmole	generally "sorting out" means flatten and reinstall
2009-05-26T00:42:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Dmole	well, if the machine has been compromised you don't know what's been tampered with
2009-05-26T00:43:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Dmole	you *could* go through everything and take md5sums but tbh it's more trouble than it's worth
2009-05-26T00:43:00.000Z	Dmole	gordonjcp	I'm thinking along those lines
2009-05-26T00:44:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Dmole	what was the box *supposed* to be running?
2009-05-26T00:44:00.000Z	Dmole	gordonjcp	web server
2009-05-26T00:45:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Dmole	anything that may have a remote exploit?
2009-05-26T00:45:00.000Z	Dmole	gordonjcp	also the person did not hide his files well I found them in /dev/.\ /.ssh with find -mtime 0
2009-05-26T00:46:00.000Z	Dmole	gordonjcp	not that I know of
2009-05-26T00:48:00.000Z	Dmole	gordonjcp	think the files I found were a decoy or the bag of tricks?
2009-05-26T00:49:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Dmole	don't know, tbh
2009-05-26T00:53:00.000Z	Dmole	gordonjcp	rkhunter alternative ?
2009-05-26T01:16:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Dmole	no, I get *paid* to code in assembly, I *like* coding in Forth
2009-05-26T01:17:00.000Z	Dmole	gordonjcp	:) lol wow
2009-05-26T01:17:00.000Z	Dmole	gordonjcp	what do you make?
2009-05-26T01:18:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Dmole	all sorts of things
2009-05-26T01:20:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Dmole	pretty much everything from web apps to tiny tiny embedded controllers
2009-05-26T02:16:00.000Z	Dmole	gordonjcp	nice ... ever use this: http://www.rfxn.com/projects/ or something like it?
2009-05-26T02:18:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Dmole	nope
