2012-09-21T22:55:00.000Z	dr_willis	cowsquad	 name turned red where?
2012-09-21T22:56:00.000Z	cowsquad	dr_willis	on the terminal
2012-09-21T22:56:00.000Z	dr_willis	cowsquad	 where at on the terminal? You mean in the prompt?
2012-09-21T22:56:00.000Z	cowsquad	dr_willis	like the letters of my user name. Am I wrong? Yes, after typing su and entering my password
2012-09-21T22:57:00.000Z	dr_willis	cowsquad	 one normally dosent use 'su'  except to switch to specific users.. so im stillnot sure where you mean.
2012-09-21T23:00:00.000Z	cowsquad	dr_willis	sorry for confusing you. What i meant is when i access my terminal via [ctl -ALT-t] and su and my password, my user name root@cowsquad-A305-S6872:/home/cowsquad# used to turn red, like red letters. But it doesnt do that any more
2012-09-21T23:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	cowsquad	 bash prompt settings...  never noticed the color.
