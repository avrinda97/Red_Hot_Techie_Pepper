2005-11-23T16:10:00.000Z	blanky		nevermind
2005-11-23T16:10:00.000Z	nalioth	blanky	applications > system tools > system monitor
2005-11-23T16:20:00.000Z	nalioth	blanky	yes
2005-11-23T16:21:00.000Z	nalioth	blanky	use a livecd and gparted
2005-11-26T09:17:00.000Z	nalioth	blanky	there is no way to do that. if you install kde-base, you'll still get "all those apps"
2005-11-26T09:18:00.000Z	blanky	nalioth	 aww lol
2005-11-26T09:18:00.000Z	nalioth	blanky	better to install "kubuntu-desktop" and have a polished kde implementation
2005-11-27T17:18:00.000Z	nalioth	blanky	gdm is fine
2005-11-27T17:18:00.000Z	blanky	nalioth	and LjL: thanks

2005-11-27T11:32:00.000Z	blanky	nalioth	What I ment was, a program or something, a method, etc., that lets me add files to an ISO
2005-11-27T11:33:00.000Z	nalioth	blanky	read the wiki, it tells you how
2005-11-27T11:38:00.000Z	blanky	nalioth	sorry for the annoyance, but I'm kind of in a hurry, thanks for the help. But could you give me an example command for the following situation: I have an ISO, and I want to add a file to the ISO
2005-11-27T11:39:00.000Z	nalioth	blanky	i dont remaster cds. i just point people to the link
2005-11-28T12:41:00.000Z	nalioth	blanky	open office is a system hog to begin wit
2005-11-28T12:42:00.000Z	blanky	nalioth	dma, that's it! I remember some program said I had it disabled
2005-12-19T06:18:00.000Z	nalioth	blanky	it's always getting better
2005-12-19T06:18:00.000Z	blanky	nalioth	do you think it has gotten considerably better since say, last month?
2005-12-19T06:18:00.000Z	nalioth	blanky	probably not "considerably" but then again, perhaps you should ask the experts in #kubuntu
2005-12-19T06:19:00.000Z	blanky	nalioth	I know about #kubuntu, I just didn't want to hear biased things
