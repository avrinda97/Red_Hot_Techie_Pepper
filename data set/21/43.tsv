2012-11-18T00:54:00.000Z	wonx		I think it's far too much. When I open a few more programs (thunderbird, libreoffice, rhythmbox), I almost reaches my 3GB limit
2012-11-18T00:54:00.000Z	wonx		But i remember that previous versions of ubuntu were muuuch lighter
2012-11-18T00:54:00.000Z	wonx		I rarely reached the 1GB limit
2012-11-18T00:55:00.000Z	wonx		firefox uses about 350MB (tree tabs opened), compiz itself around 200MB, rhythmbox 200MB more, zeitgeist-fts (what's that?) 150MB, etc...
2012-11-18T00:56:00.000Z	wonx		Plus... is it really necessary that each empathy conversation window takes 50MB or ram?
2012-11-18T00:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wonx	debateable :)
2012-11-18T00:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wonx	I'm using 400Mb RAM here...not much really, nearly the same as in Lucid, maybe not as light as Gutsy but still not  bad at ll
2012-11-18T00:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wonx	the system partition is a sniff under 3Gb.......
2012-11-18T00:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wonx	using a full Unity Shell + Compiz + Gnome
2012-11-18T00:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wonx	probably due to firefox
2012-11-18T00:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wonx	Gmail + facebook + twitter in Chrome and I go up to 620Mb used.....
2012-11-18T01:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wonx	depends what is in the tabs. Thing is though, newer Ubuntus aren't more resource intensive
2012-11-18T01:02:00.000Z	wonx	ActionParsnip	this is what i'm trying to see, if it's ubuntu in general, or just my installation
2012-11-18T01:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wonx	probably just junky  firefox
2012-11-18T01:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wonx	I bet you have a tonne of addons
2012-11-18T01:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wonx	that all takes resources
2012-11-18T01:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wonx	what other apps are you running?
2012-11-18T01:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wonx	how much ram frees after you close skype (if its convenient)
2012-11-18T01:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wonx	is your OS 64bit>
2012-11-18T01:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wonx	skype is 32bit, so you had to load a tonne of 32bit libs into RAM
2012-11-18T01:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wonx	try closing apps and noting the ram use difference
