2012-08-25T21:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	neta	have you tried connecting to a wired connection and getting full updates?
2012-08-25T21:08:00.000Z	neta	ActionParsnip	now i'm at my home and (as u can see) i have internet in my ubuntu (12.04). after the first code it asked for a password, but when i typed it it said it's incorrect (and i tried several times). to the second code it answered: precise. i don't have wired internet...
2012-08-25T21:13:00.000Z	neta	ActionParsnip	the first line worked, it says: ActionParsnip
2012-08-25T21:14:00.000Z	neta	ActionParsnip	the first line worked, it says: ^Cneta@ubuntu:~$
2012-08-25T21:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	neta	the pasword is your user password, you get no feedback, just keep typing
2012-08-25T21:17:00.000Z	neta	ActionParsnip	now it says somethig really long:*-network
2012-08-25T21:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	neta	ok, run:  sudo iwlist scan   do you see wireless networks?
2012-08-25T21:19:00.000Z	neta	ActionParsnip	lo        Interface doesn't support scanning.
2012-08-25T21:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	neta	so it sees the wireless networks, do you use a hidden ssid?
2012-08-25T21:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	neta	try: echo "blacklist iwlagn" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf

2012-08-25T21:25:00.000Z	neta	ActionParsnip	that code says: blacklist iwlagn. i don't know what is a hidden ssid
