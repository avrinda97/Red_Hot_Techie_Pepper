2010-04-17T23:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Dr_willis: surely mount can do it all
2010-04-17T23:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Dr_willis: gotcha
2010-04-17T23:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Dr_willis: nice :). Bchunk can do stuff but I guess its a onestopshop
2010-04-17T23:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Xyz: use tab to complete, downloads has a capital d, linux is case sensitive
2010-04-17T23:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Xyz: remember the case is critical
2010-04-17T23:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Xyz: every day is a school day :)
2010-04-17T23:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Xyz: try: cd $HOME
2010-04-17T23:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Antibody: move the files out, copy then move them back
2010-04-17T23:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install qt-libs but if you install whatever kde app you need it will drag in qt deps
2010-04-17T23:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Chillindave: firefox is poor with ram and cpu
2010-04-17T23:17:00.000Z	chillindave	ActionParsnip	What's the alternative?  It works fine on Windows, never have had a problem there.
2010-04-17T23:17:00.000Z	chillindave	ActionParsnip	I don't have barely anything installed!  I disabled just about everything it had.  The only add-on I personally added was firebug.
2010-04-17T23:18:00.000Z	chillindave	ActionParsnip	Oh, that and the flash plugin.
2010-04-17T23:20:00.000Z	chillindave	ActionParsnip	Yeah, I don't have enough ram to run windows virtually like that, plus that goes into "way too much trouble to go that route" teritory.  So one of those two one's you mentioned are good for web development?
2010-04-17T23:21:00.000Z	chillindave	ActionParsnip	Ahh, I gotcha.  I've never had any luck getting anything to work in it.
2010-04-17T23:22:00.000Z	chillindave	ActionParsnip	Alright, thank you.  What is the equivalent to something like firebug in those?
2010-04-17T23:23:00.000Z	chillindave	ActionParsnip	Well I know it's highly favored and I like using it, but in Ubuntu it just doesn't work right.  It's really sluggish and bogs my system down because it starts using up around 70% of the CPU, which is crap.
2010-04-17T23:24:00.000Z	chillindave	ActionParsnip	I'll give those other ones a look though.
2010-04-17T23:25:00.000Z	chillindave	ActionParsnip	Well, I did upgrade to 3.6 by adding a repository (not sure which one) that had a debian package for it.
2010-04-17T23:26:00.000Z	chillindave	ActionParsnip	ppa?
2010-04-17T23:27:00.000Z	chillindave	ActionParsnip	Thank you!
