2007-11-24T11:27:00.000Z	joeb3_	linux88	did he blacklist the original drivers?
2007-11-24T11:28:00.000Z	linux88	joeb3_	i didnt have him do that, but would he have to?
2007-11-24T11:28:00.000Z	joeb3_	linux88	mine kept crashing until i added the driver to the blacklist.
2007-11-24T11:29:00.000Z	linux88	joeb3_	do u know where the dirvers are? i used to have 3945 but cant locate them now im using somehting else
2007-11-24T11:30:00.000Z	joeb3_	linux88	ndiswrapper -l will show the alternate driver.
2007-11-24T11:30:00.000Z	joeb3_	linux88	that's the one you need to blacklist
2007-11-24T11:30:00.000Z	linux88	joeb3_	ok ill have him do that, oh and i how do you blacklist. i jsut deleted before :P
2007-11-24T11:31:00.000Z	joeb3_	linux88	add driver name to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
2007-11-24T11:31:00.000Z	joeb3_	linux88	then reboot
2007-11-24T11:31:00.000Z	linux88	joeb3_	k thanks
2007-11-24T11:42:00.000Z	joeb3_	linux88	yep....
2007-11-24T11:42:00.000Z	linux88	joeb3_	he got  netw4x32: driver installed devince (8086:4222) present (alt. driver: ipw3945), but is netw4x32 the right driver for that?
2007-11-24T11:43:00.000Z	joeb3_	linux88	let me check
2007-11-24T11:49:00.000Z	joeb3_	linux88	#
2007-11-24T11:50:00.000Z	linux88	joeb3_	even if the other driver wasnt blacklisted, should he se some kind of interface?
2007-11-24T11:50:00.000Z	joeb3_	linux88	make sure he loaded ndiswrapper.  'modprobe ndiswrapper'
2007-11-24T11:51:00.000Z	linux88	joeb3_	GOD TY, forgot about that
