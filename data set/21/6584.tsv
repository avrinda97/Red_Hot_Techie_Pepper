2007-03-21T13:14:00.000Z	mbdl		ardchoille:take a look this is what happends... when i update i get maby 20 of these failed things
2007-03-21T13:15:00.000Z	LjL	mbdl	from the screenshot, i can only see the *wine* repository failing
2007-03-21T13:16:00.000Z	LjL	mbdl	could you please summarize the problem again for me?
2007-03-21T13:16:00.000Z	LjL	mbdl	well, then, instead of doing a screenshot, just type "sudo apt-get update" in a console, and pastebin the output. that's the same thing, but it's easier than taking a screenshot
2007-03-21T13:19:00.000Z	mbdl	LjL	wheres pastebin
2007-03-21T13:20:00.000Z	mbdl	LjL	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/11388/
2007-03-21T13:21:00.000Z	LjL	mbdl	uhm, there is no error in there. could it just have been a transient problem?
2007-03-21T13:22:00.000Z	LjL	mbdl	also, i see from there that you have the "edgy-proposed" repository enabled. that is a BAD THING, disable it now
2007-03-21T13:22:00.000Z	mbdl	LjL	what it is saying theres failed downloads.... not an eror but my quesiton was is it because servers are down
2007-03-21T13:22:00.000Z	LjL	mbdl	but in what you pastebinned there are *no* failed downloads
2007-03-21T13:22:00.000Z	LjL	mbdl	only in the screenshot
2007-03-21T13:23:00.000Z	LjL	mbdl	so perhaps any server problems are fixed now. try again from Synaptic, i guess
2007-03-21T13:23:00.000Z	mbdl	LjL	all the Ign one are the ones showing as failed
2007-03-21T13:24:00.000Z	mbdl	LjL	ex Ign http://archive.ubuntu.com edgy-updates/universe Translation-en_CA
2007-03-21T13:24:00.000Z	LjL	mbdl	well, those aren't fatal errors. anyway, pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list file and i'll see if it looks alright (no, i don't think that's a server problem anyway)
2007-03-21T13:25:00.000Z	LjL	mbdl	problems on the servers would give you totally different errors, not "ign"s
2007-03-21T13:25:00.000Z	mbdl	LjL	ok
2007-03-21T13:27:00.000Z	mbdl	LjL	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/11389/
2007-03-21T13:30:00.000Z	LjL	mbdl	your sources.list seems fine, and on my *own* system, the "Translation" parts also result in "Ign". if you ask me, i'd say everything's normal.
2007-03-21T13:30:00.000Z	mbdl	LjL	hum thats weird well ok
2007-03-21T13:30:00.000Z	mbdl	LjL	thx
