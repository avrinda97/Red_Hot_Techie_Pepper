2012-07-04T17:31:00.000Z	Saiki	Dr_Willis	ok one more question, how can I search for a string inside files in a directory?
2012-07-04T17:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Saiki	 grep command searches text files for patterns
2012-07-04T17:34:00.000Z	Saiki	Dr_Willis	so I could "grep /etc  version" ?
2012-07-04T17:35:00.000Z	Saiki	Dr_Willis	sand does it check subdirectories?
2012-08-12T19:24:00.000Z	Saiki	Dr_Willis	probably a forum user, I do that on forums alot
2012-08-27T03:21:00.000Z	Saiki	Dr_Willis	./startup.sh: 14 ./startup.sh: ./logservice: not found
2012-08-27T03:05:00.000Z	Saiki	Dr_Willis	I have seen reasons not to..
2012-08-27T03:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Saiki	 SiS  dosent support Linux very well.. thats why theres isues with that card.
2012-08-27T03:19:00.000Z	Saiki	Dr_Willis	wrong person..
2012-08-27T03:19:00.000Z	Saiki	Dr_Willis	> does anyone know how to fix "file not found" on 12.04 x64 (the file IS there, and is where it should be, but I cannot open it in a command line)
2012-08-27T03:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Saiki	 whats the exact file and how are you launching it.. and whats the exact error messages
2012-08-27T03:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Saiki	 sounds like the script is running a scriot called logservice thats in the same directory.  check the script line 14
2012-08-27T03:22:00.000Z	Saiki	Dr_Willis	line 13 is a cd to logservice, I already check it
2012-08-27T03:24:00.000Z	Saiki	Dr_Willis	this error seems to only happen on x64 though
2012-08-27T03:24:00.000Z	Saiki	Dr_Willis	100% positive, I created the directories myself and moved the files as well
2012-08-27T03:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Saiki	 script is using #!/bin/sh or bash?
2012-08-27T03:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Saiki	 once ages ago.. i somehow managed to make some scripts that had extra cr/lfs on the end. I used some text editor that showed the line endings. (fte?)  and happened to notice them after about 3 hrs of scratching my head.. (yes its a long shot)
