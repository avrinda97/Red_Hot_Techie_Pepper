2005-12-21T17:19:00.000Z	gnomefreak	concept10	 theres a site with a list of them for X and i dont have it anymore nad ubotu must not know of it
2006-02-22T13:42:00.000Z	concept10	gnomefreak	are you on dapper now?
2006-02-22T13:42:00.000Z	gnomefreak	concept10	yes
2006-02-22T13:42:00.000Z	concept10	gnomefreak	how is the stability?
2006-02-22T13:43:00.000Z	gnomefreak	concept10	right this sec it has some crashing of apps but how stable will it be tomorrow only tomorrow will tell
2006-02-22T13:44:00.000Z	gnomefreak	concept10	i suggest if you want a stable system to stick with breezy
2006-02-22T13:44:00.000Z	concept10	gnomefreak	gimme an example of what app crashes?
2006-02-22T13:46:00.000Z	concept10	gnomefreak	screem sucks anyway :)
2006-02-22T13:46:00.000Z	gnomefreak	concept10	but im just saying use at own risk what works today is not garentied to work tomorrow
2006-02-22T13:47:00.000Z	concept10	gnomefreak	im looking for the page for list of _major_ changes.  for example breezy used gcc 4 instead of 3.4
2006-02-22T13:47:00.000Z	gnomefreak	concept10	and dapper uses gcc4
2006-02-22T13:48:00.000Z	concept10	gnomefreak	yeah, all of my kernels are with 3.4
2006-02-22T13:51:00.000Z	concept10	gnomefreak	i guess i dont need that much stability, i only use a couple of apps, FF 1.5, TB, Vim, Nautilus, xfce-terminal, and VLC
2006-03-02T07:34:00.000Z	gnomefreak	concept10	above is the wiki for broadcom
2006-03-02T07:35:00.000Z	concept10	gnomefreak	i dont need to set it up, I had it setup perfectly, but there seems to be a new driver included in dapper for that chipset.  Its throwing down errors.
2006-03-02T07:36:00.000Z	concept10	gnomefreak	np, thanks for looking out
2006-03-09T13:32:00.000Z	gnomefreak	concept10	if your on gnome its in your menu
2006-03-10T09:43:00.000Z	gnomefreak	concept10	please join #ubuntu+1 for dapper
2006-03-10T09:44:00.000Z	gnomefreak	concept10	that because they are in here if everone with dapper related issues would use the channel for dapper people would talk
