2008-11-02T00:48:00.000Z	fallore		will ubuntu 8.10 burn fine on a music cd-r? i don't know what the difference is if there is any
2008-11-02T00:50:00.000Z	DEdwards	fallore	yes
2008-11-02T00:51:00.000Z	fallore	DEdwards	jacobw-uk: then why did it just eject it? :[ told me it probably didn't like the medium
2008-11-02T00:51:00.000Z	DEdwards	fallore	i dont know
2008-11-02T00:53:00.000Z	DEdwards	fallore	a recordable cd is a recordables cd, all types should work
2008-11-02T00:53:00.000Z	fallore	DEdwards	do you know why it's failing optimum power calibration then?
2008-11-02T00:54:00.000Z	DEdwards	fallore	what do you mean by optimum power calibration
2008-11-02T00:54:00.000Z	fallore	DEdwards	k3b says it's trying to calibrate the opimum power
2008-11-02T00:54:00.000Z	fallore	DEdwards	and then it fails and ejects my cd, lol
2008-11-02T00:55:00.000Z	DEdwards	fallore	try a different burn manager?
2008-11-02T00:56:00.000Z	DEdwards	fallore	do you use nautilus for a file manager
2008-11-02T00:56:00.000Z	fallore	DEdwards	yes. i actually got an error when i booted about nautilus that i forgot about. let me see if it's still up
2008-11-02T00:57:00.000Z	DEdwards	fallore	i use nautilus to burn my cd's (mostly linux installs) and it works fine
2008-11-02T01:00:00.000Z	DEdwards	fallore	open system monitor and kill the process bonobo-activation-server, nautilus should work after that
2008-11-02T01:03:00.000Z	DEdwards	fallore	any luck?
2008-11-02T01:05:00.000Z	fallore	DEdwards	how do i open system monitor?
2008-11-02T01:07:00.000Z	DEdwards	fallore	i have a lot of linux expirience but dont really know how
2008-11-02T01:07:00.000Z	fallore	DEdwards	i'll try and figure it out
2008-11-02T01:07:00.000Z	DEdwards	fallore	add a system monitor to one of your panels
2008-11-02T01:07:00.000Z	fallore	DEdwards	system > administration :]
2008-11-02T01:09:00.000Z	DEdwards	fallore	i all ways have one on my panel for watching ram and processor usage
