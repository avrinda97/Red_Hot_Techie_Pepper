2008-10-15T01:05:00.000Z	Cripps		when I do a dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, the configuration goes through the keyboard and mouse setup, but doen't go through the resolution, and display driver section of the configuration ... what happened?
2008-10-15T01:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cripps	for some ungodly reason it got removed, no idea why. I thought it was excellent that it was in theer
2008-10-15T01:06:00.000Z	Cripps	ActionParsnip	damn. that sucks. Any ideas as to how to get something like that?
2009-08-26T01:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cripps	sudo apt-get install ia32-libs
2009-08-26T01:46:00.000Z	Cripps	ActionParsnip	already done.
2009-08-26T01:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cripps	then you can force install a deb and it will run, you will need to satisfy its 32bit deps too
2009-08-26T01:47:00.000Z	Cripps	ActionParsnip	erUSUL, here is some output of what I've done, and the information I have available.
2009-08-26T01:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cripps	chmod +x ./app1.unix.bin
2009-08-26T01:49:00.000Z	Cripps	ActionParsnip	already did "u+x" here's the output of ls -l:   -rwxr--r-- 1 cripps cripps 9436 2009-08-25 18:10 app1.unix.bin
2009-08-26T01:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cripps	you may want to run: sudo apt-get upgrade    to install the 26 updates that are waiting
2009-08-26T01:49:00.000Z	Cripps	ActionParsnip	on it
2009-08-26T01:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cripps	you havent given the owner +x access which may stop it
2009-08-26T01:51:00.000Z	Cripps	ActionParsnip	owner is "u" which is the first three bits (following the filetype bit)
2009-08-26T01:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cripps	chmod o+x ./file
2009-08-26T01:51:00.000Z	Cripps	ActionParsnip	"o" is "other" ... for "other users" (man chmod)
2009-08-26T01:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cripps	if you just use +x on its own, any group with read access will be given execute access, if its marked as executable then it should be runnable. You are also doing it right with the ./ notation so the $PATH is ignored
2009-08-26T01:53:00.000Z	Cripps	ActionParsnip	no joy. Exact same results.
2009-08-26T01:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cripps	try: sh ./file
2009-08-26T01:54:00.000Z	Cripps	ActionParsnip	sh has trouble parsing the ELF data ;)
2009-08-26T01:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cripps	bah
2009-08-26T01:57:00.000Z	Cripps	ActionParsnip	yeah, you're telling me :/
