2006-04-27T08:34:00.000Z	Warbo		Hmmm. I got a seg fault while checkinstalling euae
2006-04-27T08:35:00.000Z	Jowi	Warbo	using dapper?
2006-04-27T08:36:00.000Z	Jowi	Warbo	yes, checkingstall is broken on ls and mkdir commands. it has been fixed for ages but the package in dapper is not updated.
2006-06-04T05:10:00.000Z	Warbo	Jowi	I like ESD, but remember that I use Arts as a comparison :)
2006-06-04T05:11:00.000Z	Jowi	Warbo	luckily for me i'm not a kde person then :)
2006-06-04T05:11:00.000Z	Jowi	Warbo	if esd give me headaches i can't even imagine arts :P
2006-06-04T05:11:00.000Z	Warbo	Jowi	Me neither. At least Amarok isn't limited to it though (It was Artsd or nothing back when I started with Linux)
2006-06-07T13:25:00.000Z	Warbo	Jowi	Will it though? It is only a metapackage and I think reinstall will leave the main packages alone
2006-06-07T13:27:00.000Z	Jowi	Warbo	good point. but it should. I think
2006-06-07T13:28:00.000Z	Warbo	Jowi	It will reinstall stuff as in "I uninstalled it and now I want to reinstall it", but not in the "Mark for reinstallation" sense
2006-06-07T13:28:00.000Z	Jowi	Warbo	ah. so it defies logic :)
2006-06-09T11:33:00.000Z	Warbo	Jowi	Anything can do it. It is a feature of X (xrandr)
2006-06-09T11:33:00.000Z	Jowi	Warbo	that's why i added "with a nice gui" :)
2006-06-09T11:33:00.000Z	Warbo	Jowi	Yes, but there has to be a GTK applet somewhere
2006-06-09T11:34:00.000Z	Jowi	Warbo	please find one for me. I want it. I haven't found any in the repos at least
2006-06-09T11:34:00.000Z	Warbo	Jowi	gnomefiles.org?
2006-06-11T16:28:00.000Z	Jowi	Warbo	composite has that issue at least. I use feh to change background image
2006-06-11T16:29:00.000Z	Warbo	Jowi	Does that change root window or Nautilus?
2006-06-11T16:29:00.000Z	Jowi	Warbo	root window as far as I know (I'm not using gnome)
2006-06-11T16:30:00.000Z	Warbo	Jowi	OK thanks
2006-06-23T13:15:00.000Z	Warbo	Jowi	I have run Gentoo in Qemu. That takes a while :)
