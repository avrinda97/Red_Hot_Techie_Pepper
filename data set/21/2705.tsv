2010-01-26T10:36:00.000Z	paddy_melon	cfedde	can you help me?
2010-01-26T10:39:00.000Z	cfedde	paddy_melon	that card is expected to work out of the box.
2010-01-26T10:39:00.000Z	paddy_melon	cfedde	well, it doesn't
2010-01-26T10:40:00.000Z	cfedde	paddy_melon	then there is something else wrong.  do you see any errors in log files?
2010-01-26T10:42:00.000Z	paddy_melon	cfedde	no I don't, I've looked online and, no linux distros seem to support it ootb, where did U read it was supported?
2010-01-26T10:44:00.000Z	cfedde	paddy_melon	http://lmgtfy.com/?q=rt3090+ubuntu
2010-01-26T10:46:00.000Z	paddy_melon	cfedde	where does it say it works? I tried the driver and, it still won't find my network
2010-01-26T10:47:00.000Z	cfedde	paddy_melon	I'm sorry. I'm not a help desk.  If you want paid support I think you can get that from cannonical.
2010-01-26T10:49:00.000Z	paddy_melon	cfedde	no need to get all pissed, I'm just saying that there is no native support... canonical should add an update
