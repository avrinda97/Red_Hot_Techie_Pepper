2007-04-02T15:02:00.000Z	Malachi		I seem to have lost my swap partition....is there any way to get it back?
2007-04-02T15:02:00.000Z	LjL	Malachi	how might you have "lost" it?
2007-04-02T15:02:00.000Z	LjL	Malachi	and the error is?
2007-04-02T15:03:00.000Z	Malachi	LjL	while I try to find the command, where can I post my /etc/fstab?
2007-04-02T15:03:00.000Z	LjL	Malachi	post the output of  sudo fdisk -l /dev/hda  while you're there
2007-04-02T15:04:00.000Z	Malachi	LjL	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/13585/
2007-04-02T15:04:00.000Z	LjL	Malachi	post the output of  blkid  too
2007-04-02T15:05:00.000Z	Malachi	LjL	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/13586/
2007-04-02T15:07:00.000Z	LjL	Malachi	hm, ok, how do you know it isn't working though?
2007-04-02T15:07:00.000Z	Malachi	LjL	1) I can't hibernate anymore.
2007-04-02T15:07:00.000Z	Malachi	LjL	2) It doesn't show up in the File Systems under the System Monitor
2007-04-02T15:09:00.000Z	LjL	Malachi	swap partitions don't "mount", though, when you do swapon -a, that's not mounting. but anyway, what about  sudo swapon /dev/hda5  ?
2007-04-02T15:09:00.000Z	Malachi	LjL	"swapon: /dev/hda5: Invalid argument
2007-04-02T15:11:00.000Z	LjL	Malachi	the one strange thing i can see in your blkid output is that it says type "swsuspend", not "swap". but i guess that's just because you used it for hibernation
2007-04-02T15:12:00.000Z	LjL	Malachi	i'd try  sudo mkswap /dev/hda5  WARNING make sure there's really not something else than swap on /dev/hda5, this command will wipe anything that is on the partition
2007-04-02T15:12:00.000Z	Malachi	LjL	How would I be sure of that?
2007-04-02T15:13:00.000Z	LjL	Malachi	 mount /dev/hda5 /some/mount/point , if it refuses to mount it's probably swap :) the disclaimer was due, though. another useful program is the "volumeid" package, which can tell you quite precisely what is on any partition
2007-04-02T15:24:00.000Z	Malachi	LjL	Sorry, I accidentally hit Ctrl+L in XChat instead of the term, what did you want me to do?
2007-04-02T15:41:00.000Z	Malachi	LjL	Sorry, I accidentally hit Ctrl+L in XChat instead of the term, what did you want me to do?
2007-04-02T15:42:00.000Z	LjL	Malachi	last thing i told you was, <LjL> Malachi:  mount /dev/hda5 /some/mount/point , if it refuses to mount it's probably swap :) the disclaimer was due, though. another useful program is the "volumeid" package, which can tell you quite precisely what is on any partition
2007-04-02T15:43:00.000Z	LjL	Malachi	but basically, i want you to type sudo mkswap yourswappartition
