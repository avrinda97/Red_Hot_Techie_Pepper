2005-07-18T07:36:00.000Z	mebaran151	aio	but why does C# suck
2005-07-18T07:37:00.000Z	aio	mebaran151	c# sucks because 1) its primary patron is Microsoft.  this is a good thing but the negative, i think, outweigh it.
2005-07-18T07:38:00.000Z	aio	mebaran151	2) same thing goes for c# as java on the whole IDE thing
2005-07-18T07:38:00.000Z	aio	mebaran151	3) same thing goes for c# as java on static typing
2005-07-18T07:38:00.000Z	aio	mebaran151	4) same thing goes for c# as java on actually getting stuff done
2005-07-18T07:41:00.000Z	aio	mebaran151	i'd take a peek at python
2005-07-18T07:43:00.000Z	aio	mebaran151	ruby just looks like perl on OO sterhoids...
2005-07-18T07:43:00.000Z	mebaran151	aio	I liked perl too until I found ruby
2005-07-18T07:44:00.000Z	aio	mebaran151	i liked perl too, until i tried to do OO
2005-07-18T07:44:00.000Z	mebaran151	aio	yep
2005-07-18T07:44:00.000Z	aio	mebaran151	then i found Python and haven't looked back since.
2005-07-18T07:55:00.000Z	aio	mebaran151	the python community is great.
2005-07-18T07:56:00.000Z	aio	mebaran151	not sure if i'd say they are better than the ubuntu community, but they're great.
2005-07-18T07:58:00.000Z	aio	mebaran151	exec() has its places....
2005-07-18T07:58:00.000Z	aio	mebaran151	they're quasi functional programming functions
2005-07-18T07:59:00.000Z	aio	mebaran151	map() calls the specified function on a specified list.
