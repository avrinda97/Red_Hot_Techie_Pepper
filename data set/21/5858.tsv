2007-08-17T07:57:00.000Z	bruenig	vas	ok please do
2007-08-17T07:57:00.000Z	bruenig	vas	you can use little command snippets to clear it up
2007-08-17T08:01:00.000Z	vas	bruenig	.. alright.. well my ultimate goal is to receive e-mail updates whenever an invalid logon attempt occurs. In auth.log.. it logs Invalid logon attempt whenever someone tries to log on incorrectly.. so I am writing a script that is run every minutes.. the script first compares the difference between auth.log and a file called LOG_RECORDS... if there is a difference between the results of Diff auth.log LOG_RECORDS it will write the di
2007-08-17T08:05:00.000Z	vas	bruenig	any ideas
2007-08-17T08:06:00.000Z	bruenig	vas	are you using diff against a blank text file or not, that is what I thought you were saying
2007-08-17T08:08:00.000Z	vas	bruenig	it is blank at first, but whenever diff is compared to it, I write the result of Diff to the file, so next time it runs, so diff will not just keep bringing up the same logs every time it is run.. it will only show the new logs (because the old ones are recorded in that text file), then after it finds a difference, it writes the difference to the text file.. get me?
2007-08-17T08:09:00.000Z	bruenig	vas	oh so you are doing the diff and then dumping the diff into the blank text file which you then use again to diff against
2007-08-17T08:09:00.000Z	vas	bruenig	YES!!!
2007-08-17T08:09:00.000Z	vas	bruenig	EXACTLY!!!
2007-08-17T08:10:00.000Z	vas	bruenig	so first I set the results of diff to a variable, then I write teh variable to that text file.. the problem is when I try to write a variable to a text file.. I keep getting that error
2007-08-17T08:10:00.000Z	bruenig	vas	just paste your script
2007-08-17T08:11:00.000Z	vas	bruenig	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34014/ ... I REALLY appreciate this!!
2007-08-17T08:12:00.000Z	bruenig	vas	why not just this diff /home/socrates/testogo /var/log/auth.log | grep 'Invalid' >/home/socrates/scripts/failed_logon_notifier_files/auth_log_cache
2007-08-17T08:13:00.000Z	vas	bruenig	I would like to have it in a variable, because in the future I want to expand this script so it sends e-mails and other stuff... So I am trying to break it up now so I don't run into these problems in the future ;-)
2007-08-17T08:15:00.000Z	vas	bruenig	kk cool ur back
2007-08-17T08:15:00.000Z	vas	bruenig	I would like to have it in a variable, because in the future I want to expand this script so it sends e-mails and other stuff... So I am trying to break it up now so I don't run into these problems in the future
2007-08-17T08:16:00.000Z	bruenig	vas	the variable is going to be dirty because of the multiple lines and whatnot, but if  you want to get the variable's output into a textfile after you have stored it, just echo "$variable" > outputfile
2007-08-17T08:18:00.000Z	vas	bruenig	very true I never thought about that.. it will look pretty bad.. for the e-mail part of it I will use teh -q operator and stuff... I will work on this n get back here in like 2 mins
2007-08-17T08:46:00.000Z	vas	bruenig	I added a couple opperands to ignore whitespaces and stuff when comparing the two files.. but no luck.. any ideas
