2009-01-27T16:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phorensic1	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2009-01-27T16:28:00.000Z	phorensic1	ActionParsnip	I don't believe there were any xorg errors, but i guess that is worth a shot
2009-01-27T16:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phorensic1	you can just cp it, cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /media/thumbfoldername/file.txt
2009-01-27T16:41:00.000Z	phorensic1	ActionParsnip	ah haha true.. but would cat work?
2009-01-27T16:42:00.000Z	phorensic1	ActionParsnip	 why didn't i think of cp haah trying to be too smart or too learning the shellish
2009-01-27T16:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phorensic1	both would work
2009-01-27T16:43:00.000Z	phorensic1	ActionParsnip	Cool so > is to change standard output and | is to pipe a command into another yes?
2009-01-27T16:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phorensic1	yeah, cat will put the file to the screen but the > will spit it to the outputted file
2009-01-27T16:44:00.000Z	phorensic1	ActionParsnip	learning stuff is cool
2009-01-27T16:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phorensic1	| is used between commands
2009-01-27T16:52:00.000Z	phorensic1	ActionParsnip	whats the command to list all drives present?
2009-01-27T16:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phorensic1	sudo fdisk -l
2009-01-27T16:53:00.000Z	phorensic1	ActionParsnip	ahh i wasn't doing sudo no wonder it wasn't displaying correctly
2009-01-27T16:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phorensic1	yeah all fdisk stuff needs sudo
2009-01-27T16:54:00.000Z	phorensic1	ActionParsnip	I should have thought of that.. it makes sense
2009-01-27T16:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phorensic1	it also shows the partitions on the drives
2009-01-27T16:55:00.000Z	phorensic1	ActionParsnip	Do you know if they dev team will/has released a kernel for 8.10 that supports ext4?
2009-01-27T16:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phorensic1	ive not looked into ext4, you could always ompile a module to supprt ext4
2009-01-27T16:57:00.000Z	phorensic1	ActionParsnip	I suppose but Im not advanced yet, I was just curious cause I have seen people asking about it
2009-01-27T16:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phorensic1	go do some websearching of advantages / disadvantages
2009-01-27T16:58:00.000Z	phorensic1	ActionParsnip	Well, it wasn't for me .. I did look at some of the new features though.
