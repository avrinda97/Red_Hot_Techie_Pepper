2009-05-14T08:53:00.000Z	jeniffer		hi. some of you could please tellme which driver ubuntu uses for touchcreens???
2009-05-14T08:54:00.000Z	caimlas	jeniffer	what kind of touchscreen?
2009-05-14T08:54:00.000Z	caimlas	jeniffer	it all depends on how the hw is designed and connected, as well as the controller.
2009-05-14T08:55:00.000Z	jeniffer	caimlas	this is a elo touch screen using usb conection
2009-05-14T08:55:00.000Z	caimlas	jeniffer	is it registered via lsusb?
2009-05-14T08:56:00.000Z	caimlas	jeniffer	ie type 'lsusb' with plugged in and see if it registers.
2009-05-14T08:57:00.000Z	caimlas	jeniffer	is it integral to the system (ie part of a laptop) or is it a standalone device?
2009-05-14T08:57:00.000Z	jeniffer	caimlas	yes it is registered
2009-05-14T08:57:00.000Z	jeniffer	caimlas	it is a stand alone screen
2009-05-14T08:58:00.000Z	caimlas	jeniffer	ok. what's the device ID?
2009-05-14T08:58:00.000Z	caimlas	jeniffer	the full output line for that device should suffice

2009-05-14T09:02:00.000Z	caimlas	jeniffer	this thread should help point you to what you're after (ie whether a vendor has supplied a driver, or whether the kindly open source people have implemented one themselves): http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=579155
2009-05-14T09:03:00.000Z	caimlas	jeniffer	is that helpful?
2009-05-14T09:03:00.000Z	caimlas	jeniffer	I didn't read through the whole thing
2009-05-14T09:03:00.000Z	caimlas	jeniffer	I suspect that it might not work w/ the newer releases, for one reason or another, but give a read.
2009-05-14T09:03:00.000Z	jeniffer	caimlas	i asked because the touchscreen is working right in ubuntu, but i need to install some driver in another distro... i will read
2009-05-14T09:03:00.000Z	jeniffer	caimlas	thanks a lot!
2009-05-14T09:03:00.000Z	caimlas	jeniffer	good luck and stuff
2009-05-14T09:04:00.000Z	jeniffer	caimlas	i will need it....i have been trying to do that a week ago
2009-05-14T09:23:00.000Z	jeniffer	caimlas	thanks a lot....it seems it is a matter of configuration...good night!
