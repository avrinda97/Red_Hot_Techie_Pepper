2010-02-11T00:00:00.000Z	Der	iter	there si a problem, my home dirs are encrypted, and they dont mount properly anymore
2010-02-11T00:00:00.000Z	Der	iter	so i cant even access the ICEauthority file....
2010-02-11T00:10:00.000Z	Der	iter	are you still there, as i told you i have encrypted home dirs, they must be mounted first, and they dont auto mount anymore, another problem =[
2010-02-11T00:12:00.000Z	Der	iter	are you there?
2010-02-11T00:12:00.000Z	iter	Der	yes, mount it as per this: http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2009/03/mounting-your-encrypted-home-from.html\
2010-02-11T00:16:00.000Z	Der	iter	i dont know my passphrase, plus it dosent automatically read anything from my system, eeven tho it shud
2010-02-11T00:17:00.000Z	iter	Der	it's your login password
2010-02-11T00:18:00.000Z	Der	iter	no iter, i recoreded a long passphrase, plus i already tried that
2010-02-11T00:19:00.000Z	iter	Der	if you encrypt things and cannot remember the password it's goin to be difficult :)
2010-02-11T00:20:00.000Z	Der	iter	its not a password, its very very long passphrase, lots of unknown randomness, i can never remeber it, plus all my programming projects are on it, i really need this :(
