2010-11-17T20:31:00.000Z	dury		did install ubuntu 10.10 without windows all, the entire disk for ubuntu and I got error when I boot :(
2010-11-17T20:32:00.000Z	Magnum	dury	Did the install complete ok and what error do you get ?
2010-11-17T20:33:00.000Z	dury	Magnum	disk not found or something like that . Grub rescue>
2010-11-17T20:34:00.000Z	dury	Magnum	it doesn't boot
2010-11-17T20:34:00.000Z	Magnum	dury	Then grub didnt install correctly. Did you use many partitions in custom mode ?
2010-11-17T20:35:00.000Z	Magnum	dury	You need to boot rescue mode and then edit /etc/grub/grub.conf "hd (x.x)" so that it points to the correct partition and then reboot
2010-11-17T20:36:00.000Z	Magnum	dury	Thats /boot/grub/grub.conf or so.
2010-11-17T20:36:00.000Z	dury	Magnum	with live cd?
2010-11-17T20:37:00.000Z	Magnum	dury	Thats /boot/grub/menu. will also be ok to edit.
2010-11-17T20:37:00.000Z	Magnum	dury	You can do that from the original
2010-11-17T20:38:00.000Z	Magnum	dury	Scary isnt it, just a black thing that wont boot :) ... Generally its very easy.
2010-11-17T20:39:00.000Z	dury	Magnum	yeah blank thing thatit says.... "grub rescue>"
2010-11-17T20:40:00.000Z	Magnum	dury	type help... you can edit the grub startup commands and then boot also.
2010-11-17T20:41:00.000Z	Magnum	dury	Basically you just need to use kernel /boot/ [TAB_HERE]. It was so long since i did it but i think that will do it
2010-11-17T20:42:00.000Z	dury	Magnum	tell me what to do step by step, please I would really appreciate it
2010-11-17T20:42:00.000Z	dury	Magnum	first...
2010-11-17T20:43:00.000Z	Magnum	dury	I wish i could, but i dont have another computer to simulate the failure on. Let me know what goes on and ill try to help as much as possible.
2010-11-17T20:44:00.000Z	Magnum	dury	Im sure others will pitch in as well..
2010-11-17T20:44:00.000Z	dury	Magnum	before it was winxp pro installed
2010-11-17T21:03:00.000Z	Magnum	dury	I was thinking of something like this: http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-boot-ubuntu-linux-rescue-mode/
2010-11-17T21:04:00.000Z	Magnum	dury	Do you get an error description, like error 22 or something ?
