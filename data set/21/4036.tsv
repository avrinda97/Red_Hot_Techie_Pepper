2008-07-27T07:38:00.000Z	abbzabb		would anyone possibly know how to move files from a hard drive to a usb external hard drive through terminal?
2008-07-27T07:38:00.000Z	lucent	abbzabb	should be possible
2008-07-27T07:38:00.000Z	lucent	abbzabb	is GUI not an option?
2008-07-27T07:39:00.000Z	abbzabb	lucent	i'm pretty sure it is. it's probably sudo mv hd/home/ usb/home or something.. sadly gui is not an option
2008-07-27T07:39:00.000Z	lucent	abbzabb	err... cp -a source dest
2008-07-27T07:40:00.000Z	lucent	abbzabb	starting with Hardy, it's using gvfs for Gnome... but you're talking about Server or something?
2008-07-27T07:40:00.000Z	abbzabb	lucent	i tried upgrading my computer, but it froze in the middle and now is stuck generating a locale, so i have to get to the hard drive take all mystuff off and put it onto a usb drive, then reformat the main drive, and bring all the files back on.
2008-07-27T07:44:00.000Z	lucent	abbzabb	yeah, don't sweat it
2008-07-27T07:44:00.000Z	lucent	abbzabb	you could boot a livecd and do that pretty easily
2008-07-27T07:46:00.000Z	abbzabb	lucent	heh i'm on a live cd, and it says i don't have permissions to copy it from the hard drive
2008-07-27T07:47:00.000Z	lucent	abbzabb	weird... maybe it wasn't cleanly unmounted
2008-07-27T07:47:00.000Z	lucent	abbzabb	are you copying from an NTFS partition or something?
2008-07-27T07:51:00.000Z	abbzabb	lucent	i'm not too sure, one is linux, the other might be windows
2008-07-27T07:51:00.000Z	abbzabb	lucent	my the hd is linux and the usb is possibly from windows, pretty much out of the box.
2008-07-27T07:52:00.000Z	lucent	abbzabb	if NTFS is not cleanly unmounted, you will need to boot into windows, reboot, boot into windows, reboot, boot into windows, reboot
2008-07-27T07:52:00.000Z	lucent	abbzabb	otherwise it won't be readable from the Live CD
2008-07-27T07:53:00.000Z	abbzabb	lucent	trying to get files off of linux hard drive.
2008-07-27T07:54:00.000Z	lucent	abbzabb	oh ...  I wonder, how to browse as root user with nautilus?
2008-07-27T07:55:00.000Z	abbzabb	lucent	is there a way to browse as root through nautilus (i'm on a live cd now)
2008-07-27T07:56:00.000Z	lucent	abbzabb	that's what we need to figure out, I have no idea :/
2008-07-27T07:56:00.000Z	lucent	abbzabb	from a terminal you could try "sudo nautilus"
