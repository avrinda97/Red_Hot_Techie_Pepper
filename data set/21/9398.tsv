2006-04-30T06:12:00.000Z	RobyX		Guy's this is my first time on a linux program and installing a second OS. Does anyone know how to make Ubuntu the default boot and remove WinXP entirely? because when I restart it will just go back to xp agian.. and I Have to install Ubuntu again
2006-04-30T06:13:00.000Z	_jason	RobyX	can you press ESC when you boot to get to the grub menu?
2006-04-30T06:18:00.000Z	_jason	RobyX	ok open up a terminal, applications > accessories > terminal
2006-04-30T06:18:00.000Z	_jason	RobyX	now, do you have only one hard drive?
2006-04-30T06:19:00.000Z	_jason	RobyX	ok, now type this: sudo fdisk /dev/hda
2006-04-30T06:20:00.000Z	_jason	RobyX	now enter x and then d, and read off the first 3 values on 0x000: (you may have to scroll up)
2006-04-30T06:22:00.000Z	_jason	RobyX	ok, that means grub isn't being used.  I am going to have the bot send you a guide on reinstalling grub.  If anything is unclear just come in here and ask the channel.  You want the ``restoring grub after installing windows'' link
2006-04-30T06:23:00.000Z	_jason	RobyX	ubotu seems to be sleeping, here is the link: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
2006-04-30T06:24:00.000Z	_jason	RobyX	before you go, if you have problems, there is no need to reinstall ubuntu, just come in here from windows
2006-04-30T06:55:00.000Z	_jason	RobyX	when you type 'mount' does it say '/dev/hdaX on / type...' ?
2006-04-30T06:58:00.000Z	_jason	RobyX	are you using a livecd now?
2006-04-30T06:58:00.000Z	_jason	RobyX	but you did install ubuntu right?
2006-04-30T07:00:00.000Z	_jason	RobyX	ah, the livecd just loads ubuntu from the cdrom, it is a sort of preview.  What you want to download, is the install cd
2006-04-30T07:01:00.000Z	_jason	RobyX	you don't have ubuntu installed if you didn't use thte install cd
2006-04-30T07:02:00.000Z	_jason	RobyX	yes
2006-04-30T11:21:00.000Z	_jason	RobyX	where did you get the deb from?
2006-04-30T11:23:00.000Z	_jason	RobyX	you need java and once you get it you need to modify one of the files for the .deb
2006-05-01T06:45:00.000Z	_jason	RobyX	first you will have to change the current working directory to the Desktop, this command would do that: cd ~/Desktop
2006-05-01T08:44:00.000Z	_jason	RobyX	for some MS may be better, it depends on the individual
2006-05-01T09:50:00.000Z	_jason	RobyX	mp3?
2006-05-01T09:51:00.000Z	_jason	RobyX	what type of music files are they?
