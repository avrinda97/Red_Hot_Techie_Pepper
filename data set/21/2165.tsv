2010-01-12T00:01:00.000Z	malsyned		I'm running ubuntu-9.10-desktop-amd64 with libflashplayer.so 10.0r42 installed in my homedir from Adobe's tarballs, and if I leave Firefox open over a day or two, it eats up all my memory and swap.  Anyone know a fix?
2010-01-12T00:02:00.000Z	fromWinToLin	malsyned	wait until Adobe finally releases the source code for Flash in about 30 years.
2010-01-12T00:03:00.000Z	malsyned	fromWinToLin	by that point, all of these videos on Hulu I want to watch will have expired.
2010-01-12T00:03:00.000Z	fromWinToLin	malsyned	does Flash on full screen even play smoothly for you and not peg your CPU at 100%?
2010-01-12T00:04:00.000Z	malsyned	fromWinToLin	yeah, flash plays fine fullscreen and doesn't peg my CPU that I've noticed.
2010-01-12T00:05:00.000Z	fromWinToLin	malsyned	what video card do you have? I'm on a dual-core, 8600GT, 2 GB of RAM. Flash plays super smoothly on Windows XP, but this same computer, it's sluggish on Linux.

2010-01-12T00:06:00.000Z	malsyned	fromWinToLin	this is my work desktop.  I also have a home desktop running 9.10, but the 32-bit version, with the same flashplayer configuration, and it has never given me this kind of trouble.
2010-01-12T00:07:00.000Z	fromWinToLin	malsyned	go to an HD YouTube video, full screen it, and then move the mouse cursor around. Watch what happens.
2010-01-12T00:09:00.000Z	malsyned	fromWinToLin	well, my mouse is fine, but one of my two CPUs is pegged and the video is unwatchably jerky.  So, yeah, wow, that's no good.
2010-01-12T00:10:00.000Z	fromWinToLin	malsyned	you see?
2010-01-12T00:10:00.000Z	fromWinToLin	malsyned	Adobe is dragging its feet with Linux support.
2010-01-12T00:10:00.000Z	malsyned	fromWinToLin	but that particular issue hasn't been plaguing me until just now.  The real issue is the memory leak.  I'm not positive it's related to flash, even, but I thought I'd mention it since it's the one non-free component in my browser.
2010-01-12T00:14:00.000Z	fromWinToLin	malsyned	don't forget. There are a ton of other web browsers to try. Of course, I still think Firefox 3.5 is the best. Firefox, Chromium, Midori, Arora, Operate, Konqueror, etc.
2010-01-12T00:15:00.000Z	malsyned	fromWinToLin	Yeah, I'm pretty happy with Firefox.  I'd rather not switch browsers if I can avoid it.  I didn't know if anyone knew of any things to try to stop the memory leaks.  I think I'll try running a copy of FF with Flash disabled and see if it also eats memory or not.
2010-01-12T00:15:00.000Z	fromWinToLin	malsyned	you can also try out Swiftfox or Swiftweasel. They use the same Firefox source code.
2010-01-12T00:16:00.000Z	fromWinToLin	malsyned	they're not as well integrated into Ubuntu, but I use Swiftfox.
2010-01-12T00:16:00.000Z	malsyned	fromWinToLin	what's the difference?
2010-01-12T00:17:00.000Z	fromWinToLin	malsyned	Swiftfox might not have as much an issue with memory leaks. Not 100% sure. Both of those browsers are compiled differently, and optimized for certain CPUs. Maybe it will help with your memory leak problem.
2010-01-12T00:17:00.000Z	malsyned	fromWinToLin	thanks, I'll try it.
