2005-05-24T05:18:00.000Z	mkde		damn
2005-05-24T05:19:00.000Z	mkde		thanks Trickyphillips
2005-05-24T05:19:00.000Z	mkde		damn!
2005-05-24T05:19:00.000Z	mkde		that Java wiki page is pretty unreliable then i guess. Should be updated
2005-05-24T05:20:00.000Z	goofrider	mkde	what's with the Java wiki page?
2005-05-24T05:21:00.000Z	mkde	goofrider	well tritium has told me that some of those methods are not the correct way to install java support
2005-05-24T05:22:00.000Z	goofrider	mkde	make-jpkg is the official method, right?
2005-05-24T05:22:00.000Z	mkde	goofrider	thats what he said
2005-05-24T05:23:00.000Z	goofrider	mkde	that;s what I meant, a lot of ppl has provided their own DEB version of Sun JDK (they made it with make-jpkg, then share it on their web server)
2005-05-24T05:23:00.000Z	mkde	goofrider	guess lots of them add it to that page too ;)
2005-05-24T05:23:00.000Z	goofrider	mkde	yes, and there's like 3-4 different URL u can get them, all diferent versions
2005-05-24T05:23:00.000Z	goofrider	mkde	I think I should clean that up
2005-05-24T05:24:00.000Z	mkde	goofrider	that would be cool thanks :)
2005-05-24T05:24:00.000Z	goofrider	mkde	did he say blackdown is ok?
2005-05-24T05:25:00.000Z	mkde	goofrider	he didn't say that, so i'm not sure. I tried method 1 but it didn't work for the firefox plugin. Maybe i needed to do something else
2005-05-24T05:26:00.000Z	goofrider	mkde	u just need to symlink the mozilla plugin to firefox's dir
2005-05-24T05:26:00.000Z	mkde	goofrider	ok cool, i'll have a look for the mozilla plugin
2005-05-24T05:27:00.000Z	goofrider	mkde	it came with the Sun JDK/JRE!!!!
2005-05-24T05:27:00.000Z	mkde	goofrider	sure, i just need to look for it locally
2005-05-24T05:27:00.000Z	goofrider	mkde	check the wiki and ubuntuguide.org. I think they have the full path
