2007-05-15T08:28:00.000Z	SickOfWindows		hello, everyone. I am SickOfWindows. I want to remove the windows on my computer and put Ubuntu on it. but i want to do so without having to use floppies or discs. i've already tried following the "manual process" in https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromWindows but i get an error message in windows (hal.dll is missing or corrupt. Please re-install the file). Please help. I am Sick of Windows.
2007-05-15T08:30:00.000Z	Flannel	SickOfWindows	do you have a thumbdrive?
2007-05-15T08:30:00.000Z	SickOfWindows	Flannel	no. i wish i did
2007-05-15T08:30:00.000Z	Flannel	SickOfWindows	sounds like you didn't burn them at 4x
2007-05-15T08:30:00.000Z	SickOfWindows	Flannel	i have burned at the slowest speed but it's not good
2007-05-15T08:31:00.000Z	Flannel	SickOfWindows	what speed did you burn those disks?  And did you check the md5 of your ISO?  What makes you think those discs arent good?
2007-05-15T08:31:00.000Z	SickOfWindows	Flannel	yes, i checked md5sum. it's perfect. I have burned at 4x speed
2007-05-15T08:33:00.000Z	Flannel	SickOfWindows	download the alternate CD (http://releases.ubuntu.com/7.04/ubuntu-7.04-alternate-i386.iso.torrent) and then burn at 4x, and don't do anything else while burning.  What burning program are you using?
2007-05-15T08:34:00.000Z	SickOfWindows	Flannel	i've tried various ones on windows: nero, the one ubuntu recommends and others
2007-05-15T08:35:00.000Z	Flannel	SickOfWindows	alight, nero ought to work.  Try the alternate CD though.  It works on more systms than the desktop cD
2007-05-15T08:35:00.000Z	SickOfWindows	Flannel	ok
2007-05-15T08:41:00.000Z	Flannel	SickOfWindows	I have no idea how to use Nero.
2007-05-15T08:43:00.000Z	Flannel	SickOfWindows	just make sure you burn at 4x
2007-05-15T08:43:00.000Z	SickOfWindows	Flannel	i'll burn at slowest speed
2007-05-15T08:50:00.000Z	SickOfWindows	Flannel	please read my comment to Tom47 above
2007-05-15T08:58:00.000Z	SickOfWindows	Flannel	Tom47. "Check cd for defects" was my hurdle last time i tried installing ubuntu, and I gave up. please see the first 3 posters on http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=439760&highlight=check+cd+for+defects for my problem
2007-05-15T11:17:00.000Z	Flannel	SickOfWindows	And did it boot?
2007-05-15T11:25:00.000Z	SickOfWindows	Flannel	sorry, i just saw your message ("and did it boot?") now
2007-05-15T11:25:00.000Z	Flannel	SickOfWindows	What didn't work with it?  Did you check the CD for defects?
2007-05-15T11:26:00.000Z	SickOfWindows	Flannel	 this is what i mean by "does not  work": whether i choese "check cd for defects" or "install ubuntu", i get the same problem: the problem is that first, i see green dots on the top of my copmurer, then the screen goes blank/black and it just stays black/blank.
2007-05-15T11:26:00.000Z	Flannel	SickOfWindows	this is with the alternate CD?
