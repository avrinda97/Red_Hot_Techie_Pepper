2009-08-15T11:48:00.000Z	dca		Somebody help me please
2009-08-15T11:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dca	  you need a bigger swap partition perhaps.
2009-08-15T11:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dca	 resize the swap partition.
2009-08-15T11:50:00.000Z	dca	Dr_Willis	i installed gparted for that.. but not getting that option
2009-08-15T11:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dca	 you cant resize partitions that are mounted or in use.
2009-08-15T11:51:00.000Z	dca	Dr_Willis	okay... let me try it out..
2009-08-15T11:53:00.000Z	dca	Dr_Willis	How much should be my Swap space
2009-08-15T11:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dca	 depends on your ram.  if yoiu want to hibernet it needs to be  bigger then avail ram.
2009-08-15T11:53:00.000Z	dca	Dr_Willis	Thanks Friend
2009-08-15T11:59:00.000Z	dca	Dr_Willis	I cannot resize ... there is no free space preceeding :(
2009-08-15T11:59:00.000Z	dca	Dr_Willis	Any idea how can i go about
2009-08-15T12:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dca	 well you have to resize whats befor it.. then..  and shrink that.. to put some unallocated space ahead of it.
2009-08-15T12:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dca	 backup all imporntant data befor doing filesystem resizeing operations
2009-08-15T12:00:00.000Z	dca	Dr_Willis	thanks.. let me try it
2009-08-15T12:06:00.000Z	dca	Dr_Willis	Sorry to bother u again.. I have two Ntfs partitions and then the extented partiition where Linux is installed..
2009-08-15T12:06:00.000Z	dca	Dr_Willis	but not getting any option to shrink the ntfs partitions
2009-08-15T12:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dca	 be sure its not in use.. use gparted from a live cd perhaps.. or use windows to shrink the ntfs within windows.
2009-08-15T12:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dca	 i always use primary partitions.  the  partitions in the 'extended' partition may need extra work/steps to resize it.,
2009-08-15T12:08:00.000Z	dca	Dr_Willis	thanks friend...
2009-08-15T12:11:00.000Z	dca	Dr_Willis	I am logging off and trying to shrink the partition from windows.. will get back to u ...thanks once again.. :)
