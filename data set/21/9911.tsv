2008-08-24T23:34:00.000Z	GL-san		no, it is when you create your partition
2008-08-24T23:34:00.000Z	GL-san		and they're going to be written to disk
2008-08-24T23:34:00.000Z	GL-san		if you click on advanced
2008-08-24T23:34:00.000Z	GL-san		you get options for the grub
2008-08-24T23:34:00.000Z	Doonz	GL-san	you mean manual?

2008-08-24T23:35:00.000Z	GL-san		bind applications to specific monitors
2008-08-24T23:37:00.000Z	GL-san		yo hablo, pero no tengo mucha experiencia

2008-08-24T23:49:00.000Z	GL-san		so, again, is there any way to bind applications to specific displays in ubuntu?
2008-08-24T23:49:00.000Z	GL-san		sftp
2008-08-24T23:50:00.000Z	GL-san		or filezilla
2008-08-24T23:50:00.000Z	GL-san		sftp or filezilla
2008-08-24T23:51:00.000Z	GL-san	SherlawkDragon	 we already told you, sftp or filezilla.
2008-08-24T23:51:00.000Z	Doonz	GL-san	 thanc for that advice. when i manually partitioned the drive. it came up with another screen just before it started the install where i clicked on advance and it was trying to install the grub loader to HD0 when it need to goto sdf. hopefully that fixes my problem
