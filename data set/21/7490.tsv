2006-12-16T17:16:00.000Z	theclaw		hi there
2006-12-16T17:16:00.000Z	theclaw		how to set up WPA in edgy eft?
2006-12-16T17:17:00.000Z	theclaw		is there an *easy* way? (i.e. not using wpa_supplicant by hand)
2006-12-16T17:17:00.000Z	slacker	theclaw	wpa_suplicant
2006-12-16T17:17:00.000Z	theclaw	slacker	hmm i want to configure it by using the GUI
2006-12-16T17:17:00.000Z	slacker	theclaw	then I cannot help you
2006-12-16T17:17:00.000Z	theclaw	slacker	hm, thanks though
2006-12-16T17:18:00.000Z	theclaw	slacker	well i converted from debian to ubuntu because i didn't want to configure everything by hand
2006-12-16T17:18:00.000Z	slacker	theclaw	lol, ok, I can image that you want a little bit more gui in your live then :)
2006-12-16T17:18:00.000Z	theclaw	slacker	heh ;)
2006-12-16T17:19:00.000Z	slacker	theclaw	are you using gnome or kde?
2006-12-16T17:19:00.000Z	theclaw	slacker	gnome
2006-12-16T17:19:00.000Z	slacker	theclaw	k
2006-12-16T17:20:00.000Z	slacker	theclaw	http://www.debianadmin.com/enable-wpa-wireless-access-point-in-ubuntu-linux.html
2006-12-16T17:21:00.000Z	theclaw	slacker	thanks!
2006-12-16T17:28:00.000Z	slacker	theclaw	because the network manager will prob. set it up for you
2006-12-16T17:30:00.000Z	theclaw	slacker	yep - but why doesn't the "wireless connection quality" systay show up without commenting out the stuff from the interfaces file?
2006-12-16T17:31:00.000Z	slacker	theclaw	beats me .. I have tried setting up WPA and gnome-network manager w/ dapper and the one before that
2006-12-16T17:31:00.000Z	slacker	theclaw	it refused my charms, so I scripted something around it
2006-12-16T17:32:00.000Z	slacker	theclaw	now I have it working like I want (somewhat bound to one location - but it works form me)
2006-12-16T17:32:00.000Z	theclaw	slacker	hmm i'll try to comment out the stuff in interfaces first
