2007-04-08T06:06:00.000Z	SS2	sgtmattbaker	dd
2007-04-08T06:06:00.000Z	sgtmattbaker	SS2	how?
2007-04-08T06:06:00.000Z	SS2	sgtmattbaker	dd --help
2007-04-08T06:07:00.000Z	sgtmattbaker	SS2	I thought that only worked with ext2 partitions?
2007-04-08T06:07:00.000Z	SS2	sgtmattbaker	dd doesn't look at the partitions closely, it just can copy. but carefull, if you use dd wrong, it destroys everything
2007-04-08T06:08:00.000Z	sgtmattbaker	SS2	isn't there a a safer way?? I have heard of clonezilla and zplit+unzsplit but these simply do not work for me
2007-04-08T06:08:00.000Z	SS2	sgtmattbaker	no, maybe give a try with google
2007-04-08T06:09:00.000Z	sgtmattbaker	SS2	so how do I make sure I am doing it right?
2007-04-08T06:09:00.000Z	SS2	sgtmattbaker	read the help file :)
2007-04-08T06:09:00.000Z	sgtmattbaker	SS2	that help file confused the crap out of me
2007-04-08T06:10:00.000Z	SS2	sgtmattbaker	I can't help you reading
2007-04-08T06:11:00.000Z	sgtmattbaker	SS2	I have no idea what any of those options do or where they should be used
2007-04-08T06:14:00.000Z	sgtmattbaker	SS2	aren't there any other partition copiers that copy at the sector level?? So that the filesystem doesn't really matter?  device image is supposed to do that but won't work for me
2007-04-08T06:14:00.000Z	SS2	sgtmattbaker	don't know why it shouldn't work? give a try with dd
2007-04-08T06:15:00.000Z	sgtmattbaker	SS2	I do not know how.. all those options might as well be a foreign language to me.
2007-04-08T06:19:00.000Z	sgtmattbaker	SS2	I really want a good way to backup my Windows install, but I cannot find any cloner that doesn't take forever to learn, actually works, or costs $70 US (Norton Ghost)
