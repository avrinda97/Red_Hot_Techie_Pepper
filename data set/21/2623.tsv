2009-08-15T00:01:00.000Z	digitalaxis		I just installed compiz, and turn on all the cube settings and such
2009-08-15T00:01:00.000Z	digitalaxis		how do i scroll out to  see the cube
2009-08-15T00:02:00.000Z	mroc	digitalaxis	usually, hold down the two mouse buttons and move the cursor
2009-08-15T00:03:00.000Z	mroc	digitalaxis	sorry, wrong one.  ctrl-alt-mouse button 1 and move cursor
2009-08-15T00:03:00.000Z	digitalaxis		I cant even get to the cube lol
2009-08-15T00:04:00.000Z	mroc	digitalaxis	ah.  did you set the number of sides for the cube to 4?  i think it defaults to 2...and thus, not a cube.
2009-08-15T00:04:00.000Z	digitalaxis		how do i do that
2009-08-15T00:04:00.000Z	mroc	digitalaxis	do you have the CompizConfig Settings Manager installed?
2009-08-15T00:04:00.000Z	digitalaxis		yes
2009-08-15T00:05:00.000Z	mroc	digitalaxis	go to general options -> desktop size tab,   change horizontal size.
2009-08-15T00:07:00.000Z	digitalaxis		I did that and it still only shows 2 on the lower right
2009-08-15T00:08:00.000Z	mroc	digitalaxis	silly question, but did you also enable the "rotate cube" plugin?
2009-08-15T00:08:00.000Z	digitalaxis		yes
2009-08-15T00:10:00.000Z	mroc	digitalaxis	can you explain what you mean by "it still only shows 2 on the lower right"?
2009-08-15T00:11:00.000Z	digitalaxis		on my desktop, on the lower right where you switch between windows, there are only 2 options
2009-08-15T00:13:00.000Z	mroc	digitalaxis	ah, right.  the workspace switcher.  it's been a long day.  so you see two there and the settings in compiz show a horizontal desktop size of 4?
2009-08-15T00:13:00.000Z	digitalaxis		Yes
2009-08-15T00:17:00.000Z	digitalaxis	mroc	is it possible to let u remote connect in ubuntu?
2009-08-15T00:17:00.000Z	mroc	digitalaxis	that's odd.  i don't know that i can offer much help in your case.  try adding the proper number of workspaces by right clicking on the workspace switcher and choosing preferences?
2009-08-15T00:19:00.000Z	mroc	digitalaxis	i don't know if it would help to reload the window manager...do you have fusion-icon installed?
