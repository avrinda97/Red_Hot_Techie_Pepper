2008-02-16T17:28:00.000Z	Filled-Void		Can I save youtube videos?
2008-02-16T17:28:00.000Z	ph0rensic	Filled-Void	sure!
2008-02-16T17:28:00.000Z	Filled-Void	ph0rensic	HOw may I do that ?
2008-02-16T17:28:00.000Z	ph0rensic	Filled-Void	Firefox has some plugins that you can use for this
2008-02-16T17:29:00.000Z	Filled-Void	ph0rensic	thank you will read up on that then :)
2008-02-16T17:29:00.000Z	ph0rensic	Filled-Void	Go into firefox and go to the addons page
2008-02-16T17:29:00.000Z	Filled-Void	ph0rensic	would it matter if im on a 64 bit distro?
2008-02-16T17:30:00.000Z	ph0rensic	Filled-Void	it may, but if firefox is working, it should be fine
2008-02-16T17:30:00.000Z	Filled-Void	ph0rensic	thank you
2008-02-16T17:30:00.000Z	ph0rensic	Filled-Void	Ive been told that it is suppoed to be back-comp. with 32 bit.. but i have heard otherwise..
2008-02-16T17:30:00.000Z	ph0rensic	Filled-Void	But the plugin should be fine
2008-02-16T17:31:00.000Z	Filled-Void	ph0rensic	will try it out now and find out :)
2008-02-16T17:31:00.000Z	ph0rensic	Filled-Void	you use gutsy 64?
2008-02-16T17:31:00.000Z	Filled-Void	ph0rensic	yes
2008-02-16T17:32:00.000Z	ph0rensic	Filled-Void	how is it working out? I haven't tried a 64bit since edgy.. and I just burned a 64-bit disk. i have 2 more partitions to play with
2008-02-16T17:32:00.000Z	Filled-Void	ph0rensic	pretty well. I only had problems with compiling WIne but Ive made a guide for it so anyone how wanted to use COD4 can pretty much do it even if he/she is new to Ubuntu
2008-02-16T17:33:00.000Z	ph0rensic	Filled-Void	code4?
2008-02-16T17:33:00.000Z	Filled-Void	ph0rensic	call of duty 4
2008-02-16T17:34:00.000Z	Filled-Void	ph0rensic	I find that all appls are pretty much available for 64 bit as well or at least a substitute. Performance wise I doubt I notice the difference though
2008-02-16T17:35:00.000Z	ph0rensic	Filled-Void	hmm interesting... seems like a bit chance for no reward from how you describe it
2008-02-16T17:35:00.000Z	Filled-Void	ph0rensic	Lol Im definitely not the person to compare distros especially based on their bit counts. Ive found no problems with Ubuntu 64 bit as it is. SO Im pretty happy with it
