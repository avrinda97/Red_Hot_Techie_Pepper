2011-05-10T10:58:00.000Z	Zelozelos	greg	which effects compiz ?
2011-05-10T10:59:00.000Z	greg		compiz is installed and configured but not working. no option to enable desktop effects
2011-05-10T10:59:00.000Z	Zelozelos	greg	thats what i just finished figuring out, if u want ill give u a copy of my config export from compiz...somehow
2011-05-10T11:01:00.000Z	greg	Zelozelos	i dont think the problem is with compiz... i have no option to enable desktop effects
2011-05-10T11:02:00.000Z	Zelozelos	greg	are you talking about desktop cube or expo n stuff like that?
2011-05-10T11:03:00.000Z	greg	Zelozelos	Yes, compiz is installed setup and configured. I have no option to enable desktop effects
2011-05-10T11:04:00.000Z	Zelozelos	greg	not sure man sorry
2011-05-10T11:06:00.000Z	greg	Zelozelos	In Ubuntu 10.10, r/c desktop, change desktop background, 4th tab was "desktop effects". now missing
2011-05-10T11:08:00.000Z	Zelozelos	greg	oh know i c, those were released for 9.something if i remember right they were probably disabled so compiz worked better or just havent been included yet
2011-05-10T11:09:00.000Z	Zelozelos	greg	i think compiz has all the same effects for windows n stuff
2011-05-10T11:09:00.000Z	greg	Zelozelos	sure does, if i could just enable desktop effects....
2011-05-10T11:10:00.000Z	Zelozelos	greg	seems thats why im so confused, mine are working, windows are zooming etc
2011-05-10T11:12:00.000Z	greg	Zelozelos	Are you using 11.04 "Natty?"
2011-05-10T11:12:00.000Z	Zelozelos	greg	yup
2011-05-10T11:13:00.000Z	Zelozelos	greg	i finally found a page on compiz and unity, it says to do some things in a particular order, did you log out/restart after changing compiz?
2011-05-10T11:13:00.000Z	greg	Zelozelos	are you using "Unity" or Gnome or KDE?
2011-05-10T11:14:00.000Z	Zelozelos	greg	im using unity w cube instead of wall
2011-05-10T11:16:00.000Z	greg	Zelozelos	I upgraded to 11.04 from 10.10 then uninstalled that disgusting unity thing and went back to gnome!
2011-05-10T11:18:00.000Z	Zelozelos	greg	unity was a big part of the reason why 11.04 was made thats like its main new feature, hang in there a while theyll get it all working right
2011-05-10T11:37:00.000Z	Zelozelos	greg	would you like to try my compiz settings? its easy 2 do and worth the shot
