2009-10-17T21:17:00.000Z	DarkMasterHalo	skyn3t	Try out VirtualBox
2009-10-17T21:18:00.000Z	DarkMasterHalo	skyn3t	You can use VirtualBox.  I find VirtualBox way better than VMware server :P
2009-10-17T21:18:00.000Z	skyn3t	DarkMasterHalo	: thats i want to hear
2009-10-17T21:19:00.000Z	DarkMasterHalo	skyn3t	+, It is user friendly :)
2009-10-17T21:19:00.000Z	DarkMasterHalo	skyn3t	It is about 60MB installed.
2009-10-17T21:20:00.000Z	skyn3t	DarkMasterHalo	: thats good for light and faster virtualmachine
2009-10-17T21:21:00.000Z	DarkMasterHalo	skyn3t	Well, I'm running Ubuntu and Windows 7 here on my Fedora box :P
2009-10-17T21:22:00.000Z	skyn3t	DarkMasterHalo	: im on w7 and ubuntu with Virtualbox i just finished the installation
2009-10-17T21:24:00.000Z	skyn3t	DarkMasterHalo	: are u able to use Virtual Effects on ubuntu with VirtualBox
2009-10-17T21:25:00.000Z	DarkMasterHalo	skyn3t	Hmmm, no but you may be able to do so on Windows.
2009-10-17T21:25:00.000Z	DarkMasterHalo	skyn3t	I don't know if they implemented OpenGL support for Linux host yet
2009-10-17T21:27:00.000Z	skyn3t	DarkMasterHalo	: i nmeed to learn how to use ubuntu very well
2009-10-17T21:28:00.000Z	DarkMasterHalo	skyn3t	Well, Ubuntu Developper focus on a user friendly distribution with as little command line as possible.  So, it is not that hard, once you will learn how it works, every other distro are almost the same
2009-10-17T21:32:00.000Z	skyn3t	DarkMasterHalo	: how is your Display drive on ubuntu ( VirtualBox ) do u have proper drive on it ?
2009-10-17T21:38:00.000Z	skyn3t	DarkMasterHalo	: check this out maybe u can give me some advice about Nvidia drivers on VTbox http://i37.tinypic.com/314qlqd.jpg
2009-10-17T21:39:00.000Z	DarkMasterHalo	skyn3t	Did you try the command nvidia-xconfig ?
2009-10-17T21:40:00.000Z	skyn3t	DarkMasterHalo	: no
2009-10-17T21:40:00.000Z	DarkMasterHalo	skyn3t	Try running it as root and see what it does.  Were you running this VM in Vmware before ?
2009-10-17T21:41:00.000Z	skyn3t	DarkMasterHalo	: im on VirtualBox now :)
2009-10-17T21:42:00.000Z	DarkMasterHalo	skyn3t	Ok, but you ran this VirtualMachine with VMware before, that maybe be why, I would try the command nvidia-xconfig as root and see.  Otherwise, I would just uninstall the nvidia driver and install Virtualbox tools
