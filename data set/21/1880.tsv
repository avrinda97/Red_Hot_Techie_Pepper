2011-01-09T16:14:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	red2kic	maybe I should ask this, I'm looking for binutils or binutils-dev <=2.20.1 how do I manage that? # apt-get install binutils-dev=2.20.1 \ Reading package lists... Done \ Building dependency tree \ Reading state information... Done \ E: Version '2.20.1' for 'binutils-dev' was not found
2011-01-09T16:15:00.000Z	red2kic	q_a_z_steve	Yes. You want !pin
2011-01-09T16:30:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	red2kic	Sorry, no. !=pinning, holding, or backports.
2011-01-09T16:31:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	red2kic	binutils for 10.10 is version 2.20.51
2011-01-09T16:31:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	red2kic	I want <=2.20.1
2011-01-09T16:31:00.000Z	red2kic	q_a_z_steve	Apparently synaptic have older version options. Try that.
2011-01-09T16:32:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	red2kic	what do you mean "older version options" I think maybe I need a different repos.

2011-01-09T16:39:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	red2kic	what part of !=backports (because it doesn't mean old)??
2011-01-09T16:40:00.000Z	red2kic	q_a_z_steve	That's for updated stuffs such as modules, firmware.
2011-01-09T16:41:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	red2kic	every article you've pointed me to talks about going forward. Dude, 51 > 1. Help me find an old repos, or tell me to build, none of pinning, holding, backports, or any of this is applicable.
2011-01-09T16:42:00.000Z	red2kic	q_a_z_steve	Meh. Try packages.
2011-01-09T16:42:00.000Z	red2kic	q_a_z_steve	You could find older packages online -- Maybe.
2011-01-09T16:42:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	red2kic	I know because I just tried all of them, I have 94 repos. hits and yet as I am in 10.10 I am stuck in the future.
2011-01-09T16:43:00.000Z	red2kic	q_a_z_steve	Why are you trying to go back to old binutils?
2011-01-09T16:43:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	red2kic	using 10.10 as host to build LFS
2011-01-09T16:45:00.000Z	red2kic	q_a_z_steve	http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/binutils
2011-01-09T16:46:00.000Z	red2kic	q_a_z_steve	A true linux does not have distro. You could use that version, I presume.
2011-01-09T16:48:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	red2kic	I think that's how I'll have to go. outside distro for at least some things... I don't know. I think I would need different repos. to get most of those, right? like some from Debian actual deb or that?
2011-01-09T16:51:00.000Z	red2kic	q_a_z_steve	Backtrack are based on Ubuntu.
2011-01-09T16:51:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	red2kic	Thought it was more Knoppix
