2008-05-07T06:01:00.000Z	croddy		nice
2008-05-07T06:02:00.000Z	croddy		oh no
2008-05-07T06:03:00.000Z	croddy		(also, it is a myth that there is no root -- check out the process list.)
2008-05-07T06:04:00.000Z	croddy		there is no need to run an entire X session as root. that is a bad idea.
2008-05-07T06:05:00.000Z	croddy		(note that this is not a supported way to write xorg.conf -- it's just the path of least resistance)
2008-05-07T06:05:00.000Z	croddy		the root account is not even disabled. it just lacks a password.
2008-05-07T06:06:00.000Z	fde	croddy	hence disabled  ;)
2008-05-07T06:06:00.000Z	fde	croddy	! in password field == disabled.
2008-05-07T06:11:00.000Z	fde	croddy	that would be a more drawn out process... run level 1 is easier.
2008-05-07T06:14:00.000Z	fde	croddy	That is why envyng-gtk exists, to install the newest drivers easily :)
2008-05-07T06:14:00.000Z	croddy	fde	thanks, that will help a bunch at work where i have a continuous flood of whatever ATI card dell decides to ship to me and a raft of developers all demanding the latest ubuntu
2008-05-07T06:20:00.000Z	fde	croddy	Most modern systems never even touch swap.
2008-05-07T06:21:00.000Z	croddy	fde	i insist that encrypting swap is the most important thing of all, since terible things are likely to show up there even for a user who is fastidious about everything else on the system.
2008-05-07T06:22:00.000Z	fde	croddy	gcc has many features that ensures apps are compiled in a way that doesn't allow memory hacks
2008-05-07T06:23:00.000Z	fde	croddy	SELinux also is a good add-on to that situation for the paranoid... I currently have 2gb RAM, I haven't seen swap get close to being used in years.
2008-05-07T06:23:00.000Z	fde	croddy	For flash though, you can ensure it is well behaved... that is probably the most insecure addon for any desktop system.
2008-05-07T07:08:00.000Z	croddy	fde	maybe mwilson will be there...
2008-05-07T07:08:00.000Z	fde	croddy	nah, he switched to Fedora  :P
2008-05-12T14:37:00.000Z	fde	croddy	It's not, try the alternate installer if you want encrypted fs's
2008-05-12T14:38:00.000Z	croddy	fde	i don't need an installer that supports it, i need a livecd environment that supports it
2008-05-12T14:39:00.000Z	fde	croddy	ok then what rutgermasi said
