2007-09-20T14:00:00.000Z	nanonyme		a friend talked for ralink chipset
2007-09-20T14:00:00.000Z	Evanlec	nanonyme	seemed only useful if you got a buncha wireless networks around...where i live im suprised i can pick up my neighbors
2007-09-20T14:01:00.000Z	nanonyme	Evanlec	yeah, well. there's quite a lot here and i'll be using two different access points frequently later on
2007-09-20T14:01:00.000Z	nanonyme	Evanlec	and wifi-radar reminded me of how well wifi management is done in windows ;)
2007-09-20T14:03:00.000Z	Evanlec	nanonyme	ralink = ?
2007-09-20T14:04:00.000Z	nanonyme	Evanlec	ralink is a chipset manufacturer like broadcom. you find them in some wifi devices

2007-09-20T14:07:00.000Z	nanonyme	Evanlec	i don't have one. it's said to be easy
2007-09-20T14:07:00.000Z	Evanlec	nanonyme	no ndiswrapper or any of that crap?
2007-09-20T14:07:00.000Z	nanonyme	Evanlec	i have bcm4318 and it works very bad, as expected
2007-09-20T14:07:00.000Z	nanonyme	Evanlec	it's open specs so the open driver should be very good
2007-09-20T14:08:00.000Z	Evanlec	nanonyme	meaning it shoudl work "out of the box" ?
2007-10-12T11:52:00.000Z	Evanlec	nanonyme	usually yes
2007-10-12T11:52:00.000Z	nanonyme	Evanlec	what's the relevance here then?
