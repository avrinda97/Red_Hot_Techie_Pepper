2006-07-12T06:21:00.000Z	Enverex		How many things are x86 but not amd64? Lots of just a few now?
2006-07-12T06:21:00.000Z	Enverex		hmm, I see pearpc is still i386 only still
2006-07-12T06:22:00.000Z	Enverex		and wine is WAY out of date...
2006-07-12T06:22:00.000Z	dli	Enverex	since amd64 is the future, it's getting better
2006-07-12T06:22:00.000Z	Enverex	dli	: True, but my problem is I want to use some programs that are no-longer developed, so the chance of them being fixed to work on amd64 is non-existant
2006-07-12T06:23:00.000Z	dli	Enverex	if it's open source, someone might take the old codes and fix them, if it's not, then, try something else
2006-07-12T06:24:00.000Z	Enverex	dli	: I'm not aware of any alternatives to pearpc (mac emulator)
2006-07-12T06:25:00.000Z	dli	Enverex	pearpc is available for amd64
2006-07-12T06:26:00.000Z	Enverex	dli	Not according to the site that I was pointed to
2006-07-12T06:26:00.000Z	dli	Enverex	it's GPL licensed. go to a better site
2006-07-12T06:27:00.000Z	Enverex	dli	: Erm, licence doesn't mean anything. It doesn't compile because it's not 64bit clean
2006-07-12T06:27:00.000Z	dli	Enverex	http://packages.gentoo.org/search/?sstring=pearpc
2006-07-12T06:28:00.000Z	Enverex	dli	Erm, that's Gentoo, not Ubuntu, and it does NOT compile, I'll pastebin the output if you want
2006-07-12T06:28:00.000Z	dli	Enverex	if you couldn't compile it in ubuntu, take the gentoo patch, being <testing> means it compiles for most
2006-07-12T06:29:00.000Z	Enverex	dli	I use packages in ubuntu rather than source
2006-07-12T06:30:00.000Z	dli	Enverex	it builds, and it's open source, so someone can still fix bugs
2006-07-12T06:30:00.000Z	Enverex	dli	Why isn't it listed with amd64 on the packages.ubuntu site then?
2006-07-12T06:31:00.000Z	dli	Enverex	ubuntu is a distribution for n00bs, even though it has a ubuntu server now
2006-07-12T06:40:00.000Z	Enverex	dli	Why is it much better?
2006-07-20T14:23:00.000Z	dli	Enverex	amd64 is the future, all x86 cpu will be amd64(x86-64) soon
2006-07-20T14:24:00.000Z	Enverex	dli	I know
