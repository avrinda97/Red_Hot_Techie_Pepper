2011-10-19T15:22:00.000Z	Rods_Tiger		what use is the 'startup applications' thing? I click on 'add', and there's no apps visible.
2011-10-19T15:22:00.000Z	Rods_Tiger		if I then click 'browse', there's all my documents, but still no apps.
2011-10-19T15:23:00.000Z	lunitik	Rods_Tiger	you can hit "/" to type a path to an app
2011-10-19T15:23:00.000Z	lunitik	Rods_Tiger	"/usr/bin" enter
2011-10-19T15:23:00.000Z	lunitik	Rods_Tiger	but you prolly just wanna type /usr/bin/appname there
2011-10-19T15:24:00.000Z	lunitik	Rods_Tiger	still, it doesn't list the stuff that runs as part of gnome-session anymore  :(
2011-10-19T15:24:00.000Z	lunitik	Rods_Tiger	It assumes you know what you're doing... I just told you what to do
2011-10-19T15:26:00.000Z	lunitik	Rods_Tiger	then in the command space enter /usr/bin/tomboy
2011-10-19T15:26:00.000Z	lunitik	Rods_Tiger	It should be more obvious, but it isn't
2011-10-19T15:28:00.000Z	lunitik	Rods_Tiger	because you are using 11.10
2011-10-19T15:28:00.000Z	lunitik	Rods_Tiger	That is the full version from gnome2... now you have as far as the port to gnome3 has gotten
2011-10-19T15:31:00.000Z	lunitik	Rods_Tiger	you can assist with the docs getting up to date if you'd like to reflect current status, no one else has yet
2011-10-19T15:32:00.000Z	lunitik	Rods_Tiger	Simply sign up for a lp account, and log into the wiki with it... it will let you edit pages but not on help.ubuntu.com (that is more for completed works)
2011-10-19T15:32:00.000Z	lunitik	Rods_Tiger	Uses same system as for example wikipedia, very easy to understand
2011-10-19T15:33:00.000Z	lunitik	Rods_Tiger	I am mostly pointing out that it is a community process, that means work that no one does doesn't get done
2011-10-19T15:34:00.000Z	lunitik	Rods_Tiger	Certainly, but if you cannot, then you will have to wait for someone else to do it instead
2011-10-19T15:34:00.000Z	lunitik	Rods_Tiger	Firstly, I have told you how to accomplish what you want, second, you are the one that pointed out the complatency with the docs
2011-10-19T15:35:00.000Z	lunitik	Rods_Tiger	I have said simply add /usr/bin/tomboy to the command textbox
2011-10-19T15:36:00.000Z	lunitik	Rods_Tiger	get out of browse... the textbox next to browse... enter /usr/bin/tomboy
2011-10-19T15:36:00.000Z	lunitik	Rods_Tiger	whatsoever you like for name and description, irrelevant
2011-10-19T15:38:00.000Z	lunitik	Rods_Tiger	the tool was slapped together so the functionality is at least there... I have told you how to use that functionality
