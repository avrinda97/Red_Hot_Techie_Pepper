2008-04-17T01:58:00.000Z	Pelo	crazytalk	try rephrasing your question it is confusing,   short statement sentences, one statement per sentence,
2008-04-17T01:59:00.000Z	Pelo	crazytalk	by the terminal do you just mean the destkop or do you mean the text consol ?
2008-04-17T02:00:00.000Z	crazytalk	Pelo	the small window that i can access under application > terminal
2008-04-17T02:01:00.000Z	Pelo	crazytalk	type alt+f2,  type gnome-terminal in it , tell me if it still happens
2008-04-17T02:01:00.000Z	crazytalk	Pelo	i will have to restart then, k?
2008-04-17T02:02:00.000Z	Pelo	crazytalk	why would you have to restart ?
2008-04-17T02:02:00.000Z	crazytalk	Pelo	because the problem is gnome-terminal and the screen resolution control panel launch everytime i log on :)
2008-04-17T02:03:00.000Z	Pelo	crazytalk	no , do it now , I want to know if it is related to you opening the terminal form the application menu or just opening the terminal
2008-04-17T02:03:00.000Z	Pelo	crazytalk	your actual problem is that the resolution manager opens when you login ? , nvm the rest then
2008-04-17T02:04:00.000Z	Pelo	crazytalk	open  , menu > system > prefs > session,  close everything open on your desktop that you do not want opened when you login ,  including this chat client,   ten on the third tab of session click save session,    ten restart the computer
