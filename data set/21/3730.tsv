2009-07-20T23:13:00.000Z	darkblue_B		Q. I want to allow a new person to ssh in to my computer.. I have ssh setup to allow login only with a publickey.. I placed an "authorized keys" file in the .ssh fldr of the new account, but the person cannot login.. do I have to enable something else somehwere?
2009-07-20T23:15:00.000Z	darkblue_B		yes - he sent me his public key and I put that into /home/guest/.ssh/authorized_keys
2009-07-20T23:15:00.000Z	darkblue_B		there was no .ssh dir there before so I made it
2009-07-20T23:17:00.000Z	losher	darkblue_B	have him do 'ssh -v' on his end and see what it says. Also, the permissions on the .ssh directory you made are important. I think it has to be rwx by owner only.
2009-07-20T23:22:00.000Z	darkblue_B	losher	ortsvorsteher  I did have a mistake.. I dint change the perms of /home/guest/.ssh
2009-07-20T23:23:00.000Z	losher	darkblue_B	can you paste the output from 'ssh -v' from the client?
2009-07-20T23:24:00.000Z	darkblue_B	losher	yes  http://paste.debian.net/42231/
2009-07-20T23:30:00.000Z	losher	darkblue_B	as you can see, none of the keys offered by the client were accepted by the server. Please check that client:.ssh/id_rsa.pub matches an entry in server:~/.ssh/authorized_keys
2009-07-20T23:31:00.000Z	darkblue_B	losher	yes - he sent me the result of ssh-keygen, which I just copied entirely to guest/.ssh/authorized_keys
2009-07-20T23:33:00.000Z	losher	darkblue_B	time for a bigger gun. On the server, kill sshd and restart it with "-d" to get debugs from the *server* this time. And paste....
2009-07-20T23:34:00.000Z	darkblue_B	losher	ok
2009-07-20T23:39:00.000Z	darkblue_B	losher	I have done sudo /etc/init.d/sshd stop;  ## was thankful that I can still run my machine, since it is remote; sudo sshd -D -f /etc/ssh/sshd_config
2009-07-20T23:41:00.000Z	losher	darkblue_B	that just means you need to type /usr/sbin/sshd. Note you want -D and -d for debugging....

2009-07-20T23:47:00.000Z	losher	darkblue_B	Well, it's *security* software. Seems ungrateful to diss it for trying to be secure....
2009-07-20T23:53:00.000Z	darkblue_B	losher	I made the change you sugested - my partner has stepped away from his computer.. I will resume in a few minutes.. I apprecaite the feedback
2009-07-20T23:54:00.000Z	losher	darkblue_B	I have to step out. Back in a couple of hours. I'm guessing you'll have it down by then...
