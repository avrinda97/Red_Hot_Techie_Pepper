2007-03-13T16:14:00.000Z	krel		hmm.  is there anything that could cause a .avi file to completely freeze ubuntu when playing?  I have a few different movies that do this, and it does it at the same exact point in the movies, both in vlc and mplayer, in xgl+beryl and in default gnome
2007-03-13T16:15:00.000Z	krel		when it reaches that point in the file, the entire system locks up for 5-10 minutes, no mouse, no keyboard... sometimes it pulls out of it though
2007-03-13T16:15:00.000Z	krel		top shows nothing spinning on cpu or memory or anything, so I'm thoroughly confused here
2007-03-13T16:17:00.000Z	krel		or is there any way to kill the vlc/mplayer process once the system hangs?  i doubt it, since keyboard doesn't seem to do anything, actually only mouse works but nothing is clickable...
2007-03-13T16:17:00.000Z	h1st0	krel	kill <pidofprocess> in a terminal.
2007-03-13T16:17:00.000Z	krel	h1st0	keyboard doesn't respond.
2007-03-13T16:18:00.000Z	h1st0	krel	or hit alt+f2  see if a run prompt comes up
2007-03-13T16:18:00.000Z	h1st0	krel	type in xkill and click on the app if it does
2007-03-13T16:22:00.000Z	krel	h1st0	nope, alt+f2 does nothing.  oddly enough, top still refreshes normally while it's frozen to keyboard/mouse input
2007-03-13T16:22:00.000Z	h1st0	krel	so X is completely frozen?  or can you launch other apps?
2007-03-13T16:23:00.000Z	krel	h1st0	i can't do much without a keyboard or mouse response...
2007-03-13T16:23:00.000Z	h1st0	krel	so its frozen try ctrl+alt+f1 to get to a text terminal.  If not you may have to reboot the system unless you can ssh in from another pc if you enabled ssh.
2007-03-13T16:24:00.000Z	krel	h1st0	my terminal with top up is still refreshing normally, so i don't think x is frozen persay... let me try ctrl+alt+f1 now, sec.
2007-03-13T16:25:00.000Z	h1st0	krel	what if you hit q witht he top window active does it return to prompt.
2007-03-13T16:37:00.000Z	krel	h1st0	i'm messing around a bit with ctrl+alt+f1 to see what's going on while it's freezing...
2007-03-13T16:38:00.000Z	h1st0	krel	ahh  so ctrl+alt+f1 worked you should be able to kill whatever proc from there.
2007-03-13T16:38:00.000Z	h1st0	krel	also may want to just type dmesg  should show you some errors
2007-03-13T16:38:00.000Z	krel	h1st0	in answer to your earlier question, q with the top window active does nothing
2007-03-13T16:39:00.000Z	h1st0	krel	yeah then keyboard input is definately not working.
2007-03-13T16:39:00.000Z	h1st0	krel	but you could also sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart to restart X
2007-03-13T16:42:00.000Z	krel	h1st0	http://rafb.net/p/O67dts40.html <-- i get a bunch of those three lines going to my syslog while it's frozen
