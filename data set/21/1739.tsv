2010-06-23T22:10:00.000Z	blue_anna		when I log in my wireless network no longer connects automatically -- since we stopped broadcasting the SSID name
2010-06-23T22:11:00.000Z	abhi_nav_	blue_anna	you have to create 'Connedt to hidden network'
2010-06-23T22:12:00.000Z	blue_anna	abhi_nav_	sounds promising, how?
2010-06-23T22:12:00.000Z	abhi_nav_	blue_anna	notwist start again broadcasting is not relly necessary. we can connect to hidden network easily.
2010-06-23T22:12:00.000Z	abhi_nav_	blue_anna	right click on network manager apliet (before make sure to swithc on wifi button) and there is option which reads 'Connect to hidden network'
2010-06-23T22:12:00.000Z	blue_anna	abhi_nav_	ooh yeah, that's what I'm doing now
2010-06-23T22:13:00.000Z	abhi_nav_	blue_anna	hmm
2010-06-23T22:13:00.000Z	blue_anna	abhi_nav_	but I want it to connect automatically :)
2010-06-23T22:13:00.000Z	abhi_nav_	blue_anna	it wll connect automaticaly. first time you set it manualy then check 'Connect Automatically' thats it
2010-06-23T22:15:00.000Z	blue_anna	abhi_nav_	when I click "connect to hidden network", I can select the connection from the dropdown or leave it as "New...", the other fields are network name and security .. there's no connect automatically in that dialog
2010-06-23T22:15:00.000Z	abhi_nav_	blue_anna	you have to enter all the details manualy (only) for first time. because its hidden network
2010-06-23T22:16:00.000Z	abhi_nav_	blue_anna	from the second time onwards it will connect automatically
2010-06-23T22:16:00.000Z	blue_anna	abhi_nav_	no, it doesn't. :S and I dont see a flag to set it to do that -- are you on the 10.10 beta?
2010-06-23T22:17:00.000Z	blue_anna	abhi_nav_	my NetworkManager preferences file has a settings "autoconnect=true" for this connection, so I'm not sure that I haven't already gone through what you are referring to back when it wasnt a hidden network
2010-06-23T22:17:00.000Z	abhi_nav_	blue_anna	first thing is that ask in #ubuntu+1 for 10.10. I am on 10.04
2010-06-23T22:18:00.000Z	blue_anna	abhi_nav_	same
2010-06-23T22:18:00.000Z	abhi_nav_		!10.10
2010-06-23T22:18:00.000Z	blue_anna		no I'm on 10.04
2010-06-23T22:18:00.000Z	abhi_nav_	blue_anna	ok
2010-06-23T22:20:00.000Z	abhi_nav_	blue_anna	here are some search results: http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=hidden+wireless+network+ubuntu+10.04&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=
