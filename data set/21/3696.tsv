2008-11-12T10:24:00.000Z	Tyrath		ok, now I was wondering if there was a pdf reader that worked in shell
2008-11-12T10:24:00.000Z	Tyrath		fbgs doesn't work for me
2008-11-12T10:24:00.000Z	Tyrath		- it stuffs up
2008-11-12T10:26:00.000Z	Tyrath		would anyone know how I could uninstall a program I've installed into /usr/local ?
2008-11-12T10:27:00.000Z	nickrud	Tyrath	if you're lucky, there's a make uninstall
2008-11-12T10:27:00.000Z	Tyrath	nickrud	how would I use that?
2008-11-12T10:27:00.000Z	nickrud	Tyrath	just like you used sudo make install
2008-11-12T10:28:00.000Z	nickrud	Tyrath	it's a recommended practice, creating the uninstall, but not all sources have it. Otherwise, manual deletion is your only other option
2008-11-12T10:28:00.000Z	Tyrath	nickrud	say I deleated the build files. could I simply untar the tarball again, configure then run make uninstall?
2008-11-12T10:29:00.000Z	nickrud	Tyrath	should work, I think I've done it in the past (I haven't done much compilation in the last few years, and I'm old and suffer brainbit rot)
2008-11-12T10:29:00.000Z	Tyrath	nickrud	thanks
2008-12-25T06:59:00.000Z	nickrud	Tyrath	my video nano works great with banshee
2008-12-25T07:00:00.000Z	nickrud	Tyrath	no, gtkpod is a techie program, banshee is a player equiv to rhythmbox
2008-12-25T07:00:00.000Z	nickrud	Tyrath	no 'better' involved, just preference
2008-12-25T07:00:00.000Z	Tyrath	nickrud	so banshee does synchronise?
2008-12-25T07:00:00.000Z	nickrud	Tyrath	yes
2008-12-25T07:01:00.000Z	nickrud	Tyrath	then gtkpod for you, if you're using mplayer for playing stuff ;)
2008-12-25T07:02:00.000Z	Tyrath	nickrud	all I needs the synchronise. or whatever that feature is called that finds all the music on your machine for copying across
2008-12-25T07:02:00.000Z	nickrud	Tyrath	try both, see which you prefer. Not like it costs anything
2008-12-25T07:03:00.000Z	nickrud	Tyrath	then gtkpod, low overhead there for sure
2008-12-25T07:04:00.000Z	Tyrath	nickrud	because if gtkpod just handles the ls, cp, mv functions of the basic shell that's not much point
