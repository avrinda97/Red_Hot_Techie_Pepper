2009-09-16T07:35:00.000Z	RedSocrates	vavar	what's the command you're using when you get that error?
2009-09-16T07:38:00.000Z	vavar	RedSocrates	dhclient3 <interface>
2009-09-16T07:38:00.000Z	RedSocrates	vavar	are you using "sudo" before that command?
2009-09-16T07:38:00.000Z	vavar	RedSocrates	shure
2009-09-16T07:39:00.000Z	RedSocrates	vavar	hm... That's odd.  Does this do anything different: sh -c "dhclient3 <interface>"
2009-09-16T07:40:00.000Z	RedSocrates	vavar	sorry, that should be: sudo sh -c "dhclient3 <interface>"
2009-09-16T07:44:00.000Z	vavar	RedSocrates	does not show other results.
2009-09-16T07:45:00.000Z	RedSocrates	vavar	I don't know what you mean by "does not show other results"
2009-09-16T07:46:00.000Z	vavar	RedSocrates	the same Permission denied messages. then receive_packet failed on eth0: Network is down and sometimes it complains about a existing pid file of dhclient but i remove that each time.
2009-09-16T07:47:00.000Z	vavar	RedSocrates	actually the pid is a way too huge number. this must be some kind of bug.
2009-09-16T07:48:00.000Z	RedSocrates	vavar	Odd question, but have you tried restarting?  I remember having an error like this once, and it went away after a restart for whatever reason.  I think it may have required a full shutdown and cold boot
2009-09-16T07:48:00.000Z	RedSocrates	vavar	there must be some underlying issue, but I don't know what it would be
2009-09-16T07:48:00.000Z	vavar	RedSocrates	i restarted and it's still that way. that's why i seek out for ideas or possible solutions.
2009-09-16T07:49:00.000Z	RedSocrates	vavar	did you even try a full shutdown?
2009-09-16T07:49:00.000Z	vavar	RedSocrates	yes. off. no power. new boot from bios up to running.
2009-09-16T07:50:00.000Z	RedSocrates	vavar	hm... I *know* I encountered an error just like the one you're talking about once, but I can't remember for the life of me what I did to fix it
2009-09-16T07:52:00.000Z	vavar	RedSocrates	thank you. i'll find something soon.. *hope*
2009-09-16T07:52:00.000Z	RedSocrates	vavar	good luck, wish I could be of more help
2009-09-16T09:01:00.000Z	vavar	RedSocrates	self built source dhcp client works. :)
