2009-04-05T04:42:00.000Z	michal_		clearscreen:do you know where to find sound booster in ubuntu 8.10 ?
2009-04-05T04:43:00.000Z	archman	michal_	what for do you need a soundboost?
2009-04-05T04:45:00.000Z	michal_	archman	my microphone recording sound volume is too low, I have laptop DELL XPS 1530, looked all around the internet but didn't find solution. I was suggested to check soundbooster option in alsamixer
2009-04-05T04:45:00.000Z	archman	michal_	oh :-/, good luck ;)
2009-04-05T04:45:00.000Z	archman	michal_	using ALSA?
2009-04-05T04:46:00.000Z	archman	michal_	yes you are, I didn't see it :D
2009-04-05T04:47:00.000Z	archman	michal_	hmm, I have a mic boost in my alsa mixer, you checked it?
2009-04-05T04:47:00.000Z	michal_	archman	what version of ubuntu are you using?
2009-04-05T04:47:00.000Z	archman	michal_	intrepid
2009-04-05T04:47:00.000Z	archman	michal_	you?
2009-04-05T04:48:00.000Z	michal_	archman	the same. that's strange I can't find it in alsamixer itself or volume control options
2009-04-05T04:48:00.000Z	archman	michal_	Volume Applet 2.24.1
2009-04-05T04:49:00.000Z	archman	michal_	you went to preferencies and checked the box for the Boost?
2009-04-05T04:50:00.000Z	michal_	archman	what do you mean by Volume Applet 2.24.1? and there is no boost box in preferencies
2009-04-05T04:50:00.000Z	archman	michal_	I have that version...hmm...strange you don't have it...then it's maybe soundcard dependent...
2009-04-05T04:51:00.000Z	michal_	archman	I know more people with the same problem and different laptop, the same on ASUS laptop
2009-04-05T04:52:00.000Z	archman	michal_	yes, it's soundcard dependent, I switch it to other, and I don't have a boost anymore... :-/
2009-04-05T04:53:00.000Z	michal_	archman	I had a boost option in ubuntu 8.04, but not in 8.10, any ideas how to solve it?
2009-04-05T04:54:00.000Z	archman	michal_	oh! crap...i dunno...
2009-04-05T04:56:00.000Z	archman	michal_	hmm...I'm just guessing, but maybe compiling the driver with boost support if it's possible..
2009-04-05T04:56:00.000Z	archman	michal_	but that'd be the last resort...
