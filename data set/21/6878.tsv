2007-01-11T13:24:00.000Z	nemo_work	madcheez1	thanks. now, my mom is trying to get used to ubuntu
2007-01-11T13:26:00.000Z	madcheez1	nemo_work	use synaptic package manager to find one you like...
2007-01-11T13:28:00.000Z	nemo_work	madcheez1	I spent some time looking online for one.
2007-01-11T13:32:00.000Z	nemo_work	madcheez1	network-manager-gnome seemed likely.  however it didn't actually install anything
2007-01-11T13:33:00.000Z	madcheez1	nemo_work	im sure it did install.. you just have to get it working.. and its probably in the back ground working..
2007-01-11T13:33:00.000Z	nemo_work	madcheez1	I didn't think it installed because apt-file didn't return anything
2007-01-11T13:33:00.000Z	madcheez1	nemo_work	you having trouble seeing your wireless?
2007-01-11T13:33:00.000Z	nemo_work	madcheez1	but it seems that apt-file isn't returning anything
2007-01-11T13:33:00.000Z	nemo_work	madcheez1	command you gave worked, just wanted to give her a nice set of instructions
2007-01-11T13:33:00.000Z	madcheez1	nemo_work	apt-file wont
2007-01-11T13:35:00.000Z	nemo_work	madcheez1	ah. I'm relatively unfamiliar with debian's package manager.  I thought that was the utility to actually show what the package installed
2007-01-11T13:35:00.000Z	madcheez1	nemo_work	the command is sudo apt-get install
2007-01-11T13:35:00.000Z	madcheez1	nemo_work	then the program name
2007-01-11T13:35:00.000Z	nemo_work	madcheez1	um. I know that much at least
2007-01-11T13:35:00.000Z	nemo_work	madcheez1	I'm trying to see what the package actually installed
2007-01-11T13:35:00.000Z	madcheez1	nemo_work	ah
2007-01-11T13:36:00.000Z	madcheez1	nemo_work	yep
