2006-11-23T06:48:00.000Z	Almindor		bugged?
2006-11-23T06:48:00.000Z	Almindor		not updating drivers?
2006-11-23T06:48:00.000Z	Almindor		but nobody depends on it
2006-11-23T06:48:00.000Z	Almindor		there's no reason to freeze it
2006-11-23T06:49:00.000Z	Almindor		so basicly, if someone needs a new version a driver or kernel because of a driver, they are forced to not use ubuntu, or update into latest?
2006-11-23T06:50:00.000Z	Almindor		yeah I was there
2006-11-23T06:50:00.000Z	Almindor		shit happens
2006-11-23T06:50:00.000Z	Almindor		they should've tested before pushing to main but ok
2006-11-23T06:50:00.000Z	Almindor		hmm
2006-11-23T06:51:00.000Z	Almindor		i'll google him, thanks
2006-11-23T06:51:00.000Z	teledyn	Almindor	i thought the nvidia driver was updated recently
2006-11-23T06:52:00.000Z	Almindor		it's still 8x
2006-11-23T06:52:00.000Z	teledyn	Almindor	so?
2006-11-23T06:52:00.000Z	Almindor	teledyn	latest is 9x
2006-11-23T06:53:00.000Z	teledyn	Almindor	if you want bleeding edge/unstable then install it yourself.  don't expect support
2006-11-23T06:53:00.000Z	Almindor	teledyn	that's not bleeding edge
2006-11-23T06:53:00.000Z	Almindor	teledyn	it's a STABLE release from nvidia old 2 weeks now
2006-11-23T06:53:00.000Z	Almindor		or more
2006-11-23T06:53:00.000Z	teledyn	Almindor	2 weeks old is not stable in distro terms
2006-11-23T06:54:00.000Z	Almindor		what is? 6 months?
2006-11-23T06:54:00.000Z	teledyn	Almindor	you don't understand how the distro development and testing processes work?
