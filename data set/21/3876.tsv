2008-08-31T20:57:00.000Z	Miiikeee		I don't have a physical hub, dmesg said it sees the 5 ports in a hub
2008-08-31T20:58:00.000Z	Miiikeee		all the ports are direct to the mother board
2008-08-31T20:58:00.000Z	bofh80	Miiikeee	the 'hub' you are describing is actually your onboard usb controller / chipset.
2008-08-31T20:59:00.000Z	bofh80	Miiikeee	could you repst your question? i joined after you asked it. or pm or to me . .
2008-08-31T20:59:00.000Z	bofh80	Miiikeee	has someone else suggest lsusb ?
2008-08-31T21:00:00.000Z	bofh80	Miiikeee	ok type lsusb in a terminal, and see if it show's you anything connected to the usb :)
2008-08-31T21:00:00.000Z	bofh80	Miiikeee	that's LS in lowercase not 1s yes :)
2008-08-31T21:01:00.000Z	Miiikeee	bofh80	no response to lsusb
2008-08-31T21:02:00.000Z	bofh80	Miiikeee	just a blank output? rargh. what have you got connected at the moment??
2008-08-31T21:02:00.000Z	bofh80	Miiikeee	i'm wondering if this is the OLD   -   UCHI - OCHI thing, but it's been so long since i looked at that . ..
2008-08-31T21:03:00.000Z	Miiikeee	bofh80	I've tried a usb stick, usb hard drive and a webcam
2008-08-31T21:05:00.000Z	bofh80	Miiikeee	was the USB working at any point? ie if you had windows on it ?
2008-08-31T21:05:00.000Z	Miiikeee	bofh80	usb is fine on windows xp
2008-08-31T21:06:00.000Z	Miiikeee	bofh80	I even switched over to win xp a bit ago to make sure usb was working there
2008-08-31T21:07:00.000Z	bofh80	Miiikeee	ouch ok. do you know how to use pastebin Miiikeee ?
2008-08-31T21:11:00.000Z	bofh80	Miiikeee	dmesg
2008-08-31T21:26:00.000Z	bofh80	Miiikeee	it don't think your supposed to use OCHI and UCHI at the same time. i will be afk for half an hour or so. i will have more time to look at it then, unless someone else can you help you.
2008-08-31T21:26:00.000Z	bofh80	Miiikeee	since you haven't asked your question in a while, feel free to pipe up, and ask again :)
2008-08-31T21:26:00.000Z	bofh80	Miiikeee	you have them both installed, that's the seemable problem, tehy are both loading
2008-08-31T21:27:00.000Z	bofh80	Miiikeee	if anyone wants to help you , they will want to see that pastebin you did for me. but otherwise like i said, 30 minutes. ..
2008-08-31T21:28:00.000Z	bofh80	Miiikeee	again i get lost here, i assume you would have to blacklist the module. but i'm not sure . .. . . haven't dealt with ochi uchi since ubuntu 6.0.6
