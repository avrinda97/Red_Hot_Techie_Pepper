2007-04-21T05:32:00.000Z	robbie_crash		I am missing one hard drive from my fstab, it's listed, but apparently its uuid and dev/* have changed since upgrading so it will no longer mount. How can I determine what it is, when it doesn't show up in gparted, and I can't open hardware information  because it crashes as soon as I load it up. I have two questions: 1) how can I figure out what the drive is now, and 2) how can I fix the crashing with hardware information?
2007-04-21T05:34:00.000Z	indecision	robbie_crash	you could try replacing the UUID in your fstab file with the drive's device name instead.  you'll need to figure out that that is, of course.
2007-04-21T05:34:00.000Z	robbie_crash	indecision	I can't figure that out without hardware information or fdisk, and it doesn't show up in either
2007-04-21T05:35:00.000Z	indecision	robbie_crash	how's the drive physically connected?
2007-04-21T05:37:00.000Z	indecision	robbie_crash	how's the drive physically connected?  IDE?  SATA?  something else?
2007-04-21T05:37:00.000Z	robbie_crash	indecision	ide
2007-04-21T05:37:00.000Z	indecision	robbie_crash	is it on the primary or secondary channel, and is it the master or the slave drive?
2007-04-21T05:38:00.000Z	robbie_crash	indecision	wait, no, third ide channel as master
2007-04-21T05:39:00.000Z	indecision	robbie_crash	If I'm remembering how this works correctly, that drive *should* be /dev/hde ... try mounting it manually before messing with fstab
2007-04-21T05:39:00.000Z	robbie_crash	indecision	no luk
2007-04-21T05:40:00.000Z	indecision	robbie_crash	no luckj?  damnj.  ;)
2007-04-21T05:41:00.000Z	indecision	robbie_crash	well it's a bit more of a pain, but it's probably detected on boot.  you could look through dmesg
2007-04-21T05:41:00.000Z	robbie_crash	indecision	dmesg?
2007-04-21T05:42:00.000Z	indecision	robbie_crash	type it at a console.  it'll spit out every line of output that's hidden behind the "ubuntu" splash screen when you boot.  everything that happens during startup is logged by it.
2007-04-21T05:42:00.000Z	indecision	robbie_crash	you can type something like "dmesg > ~/dmesg.txt" and then open that file in gedit for easier reading/searching
2007-04-21T05:44:00.000Z	robbie_crash	indecision	I think that told me where the drive is, cause it's on the second ide controller chip, on its second channel, and the other drive that's on that controller, on the other channel, is sda, and then my sata drive is sdc
2007-04-21T05:45:00.000Z	robbie_crash	indecision	so I guess it must be sdb, but it's not loading, how can I figure out why not, or where to fix it?
2007-04-21T05:45:00.000Z	robbie_crash	indecision	could it be a bunged up fs?
2007-04-21T05:46:00.000Z	indecision	robbie_crash	you sure you're mounting the right partition on that disk?  and yes, it's entirely possible that the partition table or filesystem got messed up.
2007-04-21T05:47:00.000Z	robbie_crash	indecision	there's only one partition on the drive. Let me reboot again and see if I can figure anything out
2007-04-21T05:47:00.000Z	indecision	robbie_crash	(un?)fortunately I haven't had to recover a damaged filesystem in linux yet, but there's lots of guides out there with advice on what to do
