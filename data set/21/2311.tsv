2009-12-27T03:27:00.000Z	Izinucs		here's what I get when I try to run sudo apt-get update .. lots of Err 404's .. http://paste.ubuntu.com/347269/ How do I correct that
2009-12-27T03:29:00.000Z	mka	Izinucs	it looks like those repos are bad (for now). you either comment them out or ignore the 404's
2009-12-27T03:30:00.000Z	Izinucs	mka	it happens even after changing the default servers..
2009-12-27T03:32:00.000Z	mka	Izinucs	you have a lot of repos there. I suggest you just ignore the 404's unless you can't get some specific packages
2009-12-27T03:33:00.000Z	Izinucs	mka	it's weird that there are so many repos.. here's my sources list.. http://pastebin.com/f52fc95de
2009-12-27T03:34:00.000Z	Izinucs	mka	r0k3tm3n yea.. restarting doesn't solve much.. I'm just trying to do a apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
2009-12-27T03:35:00.000Z	mka	Izinucs	the servers are probably down and if that is the case, just let it go
2009-12-27T03:36:00.000Z	Izinucs	mka	servers in the U.S. , England, and Main?  Tried all three locations.
2009-12-27T03:37:00.000Z	mka	Izinucs	what is this ubuntu-rocks.org thing?
2009-12-27T03:37:00.000Z	Izinucs	mka	I had synaptic search for the fastest server to my location.. that's what it chose.
2009-12-27T03:38:00.000Z	mka	Izinucs	ok, but is there a package you cannot install because of these errors?
2009-12-27T03:38:00.000Z	Izinucs	mka	.. not sure.. haven't tried..
2009-12-27T03:39:00.000Z	mka	Izinucs	you have far more than enough repos
2009-12-27T03:41:00.000Z	Izinucs	mka	you'd think.. it looks like the intrepid -updates, -main, -restricted... are the ones giving issues.. those should always be active.. most of the others are for other packages that I like to keep on top of .. and they seem to be functional
2009-12-27T03:43:00.000Z	mka	Izinucs	what does ddebs.ubuntu.com repos differ to those of archive.ubuntu-rocks.org?
2009-12-27T03:45:00.000Z	Izinucs	mka	yea.. I've been looking at those.. I'm not sure where they are coming from.. they appear to be main repos for intrepid but have issues possibly because of the address line containing "binary-i386/Packages.gz" in the address line
2009-12-27T03:48:00.000Z	Izinucs	mka	what's the difference between a repo beginning with deb http://<address> vs. deb http://*ddebs*.<address line>
2009-12-27T03:49:00.000Z	mka	Izinucs	it's the first time I see ddebs
2009-12-27T03:49:00.000Z	Izinucs	mka	maybe I'll just comment them out and see what happens.
2009-12-27T03:51:00.000Z	Izinucs	mka	looks like it's fixed.. no more errors.. weird
2009-12-27T03:53:00.000Z	Izinucs	mka	now I'm off to reinstall windows for my son.. that's a two day process with all the updates, drivers, configuration, software install etc.. argggg.
