2007-05-27T14:10:00.000Z	Rodel		how do i get gawk?
2007-05-27T14:10:00.000Z	_nix_	Rodel	you probably have it installed. try awk --help to check out.
2007-05-27T14:03:00.000Z	_nix_	Rodel	you probably don't have a C compiler installed
2007-05-27T14:04:00.000Z	_nix_	Rodel	try "unset CC" and then ./configure
2007-05-27T14:04:00.000Z	_nix_	Rodel	and "unset CFLAGS" too
2007-05-27T14:07:00.000Z	_nix_	Rodel	gawk is the gnu's version of awk
2007-05-27T14:10:00.000Z	_nix_	Rodel	It is mainly used for manipulating text data.
2007-05-27T14:14:00.000Z	_nix_	Rodel	enter 'awk' in the terminal. You should see some output other than no such command..
2007-05-27T14:16:00.000Z	Rodel	_nix_	awk does nothing
2007-05-27T14:17:00.000Z	_nix_	Rodel	try awk --help, you should see some output. that means gawk is installed
2007-05-27T14:18:00.000Z	Rodel	_nix_	it returns "awk: not an option: --help"
2007-05-27T14:18:00.000Z	_nix_	Rodel	ok you've got gawk installed. Are you trying something with it?
2007-05-27T14:19:00.000Z	Rodel	_nix_	im trying to install garnome and when i run it it goes through some stuff and it says "checking for gawk... no"
2007-05-27T14:19:00.000Z	_nix_	Rodel	lemme check. .just a min
2007-05-27T14:19:00.000Z	Rodel	_nix_	but it says i have mawk... what ever that would be
2007-05-27T14:20:00.000Z	_nix_	Rodel	mawk?? oh.. k its quiet equivalant to gawk anyways.
2007-05-27T14:21:00.000Z	Rodel	_nix_	so what would be causing "checking for C compiler default output file name... configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables"
2007-05-27T14:22:00.000Z	_nix_	Rodel	i've never compiled GARNOME myself. however a default install of ubuntu with the build-essential package should be enough for a c compiler with exec support et al.
