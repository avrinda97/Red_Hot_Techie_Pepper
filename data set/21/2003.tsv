2010-02-15T12:43:00.000Z	coltcabana		hey guys I've got a quick question
2010-02-15T12:43:00.000Z	coltcabana		I'm installing the latest version of ubuntu on a dell laptop
2010-02-15T12:43:00.000Z	coltcabana		on the live CD
2010-02-15T12:43:00.000Z	coltcabana		my wireless card works fine
2010-02-15T12:43:00.000Z	coltcabana		I go to the drivers menu and it says
2010-02-15T12:43:00.000Z	coltcabana		"hey here's a nasty not open driver that'll amke your wireless work"
2010-02-15T12:43:00.000Z	coltcabana		no problem whatsoever
2010-02-15T12:43:00.000Z	coltcabana		sorry let me rephrase
2010-02-15T12:44:00.000Z	coltcabana		okay on the live CD my wireless card works fine, on the actual install it does not, it's on a dell laptop and the "here's the nasty closed source driver you need to make it work" that I get on the live CD isn't there on the install
2010-02-15T12:46:00.000Z	om26er	coltcabana	tried rebooting?
2010-02-15T12:47:00.000Z	coltcabana	om26er	I did - it has no problem at all finding that driver on the live CD, but on the actual install it doesn't do it.
2010-02-15T12:48:00.000Z	om26er	coltcabana	seems like a jockey bug
2010-02-15T12:48:00.000Z	coltcabana	om26er	is it possible there are libraries stored on the CD that aren't on the default install?
2010-02-15T12:49:00.000Z	om26er	coltcabana	no, some apps are on the live cd and are not in installation but they are not related to driver type of stuff.
2010-02-15T12:51:00.000Z	coltcabana	om26er	weird then, I don't know what to tell you.  Works fine on the live CD but not on the install, kinda disheartening
2010-02-15T12:52:00.000Z	om26er	coltcabana	which wifi you have?
2010-02-15T12:53:00.000Z	coltcabana	om26er	let me try one last thing before we dig a little deeper
2010-02-15T13:20:00.000Z	om26er		!hi | zslashz
2010-02-15T13:21:00.000Z	om26er		!lubuntu
2010-02-15T13:22:00.000Z	coltcabana	om26er	there's absolutely drivers and stuff that are nto included in the default install that are on the live CD
2010-02-15T13:22:00.000Z	coltcabana	om26er	I had to plug in a wired connection and update everything to get my wireless to work
