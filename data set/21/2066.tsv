2010-05-14T00:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	manster	it is the first two paragraphs
2010-05-14T00:10:00.000Z	manster	erUSUL	i tried with Firestarter
2010-05-14T00:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	manster	it is called the 9.10 method
2010-05-14T00:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	manster	quote « When logged into your computer right click on the network indicator in the top right hand corner, click on "Edit Connections..." select "Auto Eth0" and click "Edit..." then go to the "IPv4 Settings" tab and next to "Method:" select the drop down box and select the option that says "Shared to other computers". »
2010-05-14T00:11:00.000Z	manster	erUSUL	yes did that
2010-05-14T00:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	manster	and?
2010-05-14T00:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	manster	you have to edit the interface that is connected to internet not the one the other computer is pluggerd into
2010-05-14T00:19:00.000Z	manster	erUSUL	setting my lan's ip4 mode to "shared" stops it from working
2010-05-14T00:19:00.000Z	manster	erUSUL	but i understand your point
2010-05-14T00:19:00.000Z	manster	erUSUL	just not sure why it stops working
2010-05-14T00:19:00.000Z	manster	erUSUL	setting my lan's ip4 mode to "shared" stops it from working
2010-05-14T00:19:00.000Z	manster	erUSUL	just not sure why it stops working
2010-05-14T00:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	manster	the one you have to set to shared is the one that is facing internet. not the one that is connected to lan
2010-05-14T00:20:00.000Z	manster	erUSUL	so i create a new wireless connection with the ip4 mode set to shared?
2010-05-14T00:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	manster	no set the wirelles interface you are already using to connect to internet as shared
2010-05-14T00:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	manster	then if you plug a computer to you computer via a wired cable it will be able to connect to internet via your wireless
2010-05-14T00:22:00.000Z	manster	erUSUL	my internet comes in through my ethernet cord and i want to share it with my wireless card, i'm not sure i explained well
2010-05-14T00:33:00.000Z	manster	erUSUL	it half works, the computer i want to connect to is now networked with the sharing computer but the internet is not working in the recieving end
