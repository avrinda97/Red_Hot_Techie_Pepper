2005-04-01T09:43:00.000Z	Absenth		what would be an example of a very light weight web browser, that at least mostly functions?
2005-04-01T09:43:00.000Z	Absenth		just pulling up a page in firefox on this computer takes the cpu to 90% ormore.
2005-04-01T09:44:00.000Z	Absenth		the page?  www.userfriendly.org
2005-04-01T09:44:00.000Z	caffinated	Absenth	well, if you're willing to go non-free, i'd suggest opera
2005-04-01T09:48:00.000Z	caffinated	Absenth	well, you could try something that uses khtml, but i'm less than happy with that engine myself.
2005-04-01T09:56:00.000Z	caffinated	Absenth	e is closer to z?
2005-04-01T09:56:00.000Z	caffinated	Absenth	eterm has a few more eye-candy options ;)
2005-04-01T10:03:00.000Z	caffinated	Absenth	well, to give you an idea:  i've used linux off and on forever.  and I always go back to windows.  there is always some annoyance or issue or problem that angers me enough to go back.  I think they may have actually got it to the point where it's a viable alternative now.
2005-04-01T10:03:00.000Z	Absenth	caffinated	I'm in the same boat.  Although I've found recently if you're willing to pull your hair out in the first few weeks after setup to get everything working.  then it's smooth sailing.
2005-04-01T10:04:00.000Z	caffinated	Absenth	many people mistake my attitude as some kind of "fanboyism" but the truth is, i've been waiting, and checking back for a long time now waiting for *this*
2005-04-01T10:04:00.000Z	Absenth	caffinated	also it's nice not to have the system performance degrade over the next 6 weeks --> 6 months forcing another reinstall.
2005-04-01T10:05:00.000Z	Absenth	caffinated	what I've been waiting for was a way to use linux, and still get my work done at the office which is over 99% windows.
2005-04-01T10:05:00.000Z	Absenth	caffinated	it it wasn't quite so....  stupid....  I'd probibly be using Xandros 3.0 buisness edition at work, since it intigrated with AD really nicely.  However I don't really want to pay $129 for something I don't like.
2005-04-01T10:06:00.000Z	Absenth	caffinated	I'm pretty Pro OpenBSD.
2005-04-01T10:06:00.000Z	caffinated	Absenth	heh, i actually destroyed my first installation with too much tinkering
2005-04-01T10:08:00.000Z	caffinated	Absenth	under windows i don't use cygwin, i use services for unix
2005-04-01T10:08:00.000Z	caffinated	Absenth	it's still free (albiet it needs 2000 or XP pro) but it's much better integrated, and i found things easier to compile.
2005-04-02T08:45:00.000Z	Absenth	caffinated	can't be as bad a Gary Indiana
2005-04-02T08:45:00.000Z	caffinated	Absenth	i bet it could give it a good run for it's money
2005-04-02T08:59:00.000Z	caffinated	Absenth	i don't believe so
2005-04-02T08:59:00.000Z	Absenth	caffinated	I didn't think so either......  if it did, does anyone know where the dhcpd.conf would live?
