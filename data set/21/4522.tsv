2008-04-12T09:33:00.000Z	_Andrew	TerrorismSux	What version of Ubuntu did you install?
2008-04-12T09:34:00.000Z	_Andrew	TerrorismSux	Kubuntu, Ubuntu, the alternative cd?

2008-04-12T09:35:00.000Z	_Andrew	TerrorismSux	Then you already have X installed eh?
2008-04-12T09:35:00.000Z	_Andrew	TerrorismSux	System -> Admin -> Restricted Drivers Manager -> Tick the nvidia one
2008-04-12T09:36:00.000Z	TerrorismSux	_Andrew	i do not have a "Restricted Drivers Manager"
2008-04-12T09:37:00.000Z	TerrorismSux	_Andrew	should i reboot after apt-get install nvidia-glx?

2008-04-12T09:39:00.000Z	_Andrew	TerrorismSux	Try apt-get install nvidia-glx then
2008-04-12T09:39:00.000Z	_Andrew	TerrorismSux	Then you need to edit your xorg.conf and change nv to nvidia under the drivers section
2008-04-12T09:49:00.000Z	TerrorismSux	_Andrew	what should i do in my xorg.conf ?
2008-04-12T09:50:00.000Z	_Andrew	TerrorismSux	 Find where it says "nv" change it to "nvidia"
