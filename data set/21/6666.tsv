2007-05-10T10:46:00.000Z	Alonea	Yggdrasil	nothing will automount anymore. My cdrom would not unmount earlier and I have to stick a pin in the hole to get it to eject the disk. Now my cdrom isn't mounted anymore and wont mount again. There is also now a locked folder called My Book which is referring to my external hdd that is not even hooked up anymore
2007-05-10T10:47:00.000Z	Alonea	Yggdrasil	yes. its been like this for 2 days, though today was the first time I tried to eject my cd drive. none of my thumb drives will automount anymore
2007-05-10T10:47:00.000Z	Alonea	Yggdrasil	ok
2007-05-10T10:49:00.000Z	Alonea	Yggdrasil	do you think it might be caused by the iso I mounted yesterday? (though it didn't work like I hoped it would. trying to vmware an os)

2007-05-10T10:52:00.000Z	Alonea	Yggdrasil	how would I unlock it?
2007-05-10T10:53:00.000Z	Alonea	Yggdrasil	well, it appeared to do something
2007-05-10T10:53:00.000Z	Alonea	Yggdrasil	ok, its off noq
2007-05-10T10:54:00.000Z	Alonea	Yggdrasil	vmware isn't even on at the moment I don't think. and yes it unmounted. vmware isn't even using that iso anymore because it didn't work
2007-05-10T10:54:00.000Z	Alonea	Yggdrasil	just checked mount, its not listed anymore. Do I need to restart for everything to be working again?
2007-05-10T10:58:00.000Z	Alonea	Yggdrasil	nothing...
2007-05-10T10:58:00.000Z	Alonea	Yggdrasil	though I am getting an error from artsmessage now when I startup
2007-05-10T10:58:00.000Z	Alonea	Yggdrasil	I got rid of those too.
2007-05-10T10:59:00.000Z	Alonea	Yggdrasil	those were left over from yesterday.
2007-05-10T11:00:00.000Z	Alonea	Yggdrasil	ok, last thing when I put in a thumb drive it says May 10 00:00:02 alonea-laptop kernel: [110326.472000]  sd 9:0:0:0: Attached scsi generic sg0 type 0
2007-05-10T11:01:00.000Z	Alonea	Yggdrasil	ok, I removed that folder
2007-05-10T11:02:00.000Z	Alonea	Yggdrasil	brb
