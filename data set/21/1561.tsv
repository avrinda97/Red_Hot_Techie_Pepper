2010-08-12T10:43:00.000Z	Wiesshund	JackStoner	lol stupid script, web designer didnt think ahead
2010-08-12T10:43:00.000Z	JackStoner	Wiesshund	i know...but i need to watch that...any ideas?
2010-08-12T10:44:00.000Z	Wiesshund	JackStoner	maybe, 1 sec
2010-08-12T10:44:00.000Z	JackStoner	Wiesshund	thnks
2010-08-12T10:48:00.000Z	Wiesshund	JackStoner	https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/59 might work
2010-08-12T10:49:00.000Z	JackStoner	Wiesshund	will try it...
2010-08-12T10:49:00.000Z	Wiesshund	JackStoner	it still may not display right, the page is written IE specific
2010-08-12T10:50:00.000Z	JackStoner	Wiesshund	i dont know why this guy was so biased towards IE...well, giving it a shot
2010-08-12T10:50:00.000Z	Wiesshund	JackStoner	not so much biased as the tools he used probably, its some kind of MS Office presentation
2010-08-12T10:51:00.000Z	JackStoner	Wiesshund	it doesnt throw the error but i dont see anything
2010-08-12T10:51:00.000Z	Wiesshund	JackStoner	so it depends or atleast thinks it does, on certain part of IE being available
2010-08-12T10:52:00.000Z	Wiesshund	JackStoner	http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/page/Installation:Ubuntu
2010-08-12T10:54:00.000Z	JackStoner	Wiesshund	thanks...i dont think its worth getting IE...its just one page, dont wanna get wine involved :P
2010-08-12T10:56:00.000Z	Wiesshund	JackStoner	do you know how long the vid is supposed to be?
