2012-06-16T14:34:00.000Z	Lupa		omgosh the mouse support in Lubuntu is bad
2012-06-16T14:34:00.000Z	Lupa		I may have to plug in a usb mouse
2012-06-16T14:34:00.000Z	Lupa		but I need it for my main pc
2012-06-16T14:35:00.000Z	fasta	Lupa	ps/2 works.
2012-06-16T14:35:00.000Z	fasta	Lupa	which mouse support do you want?
2012-06-16T14:35:00.000Z	fasta	Lupa	and that doesn't work? What makes you think that?
2012-06-16T14:36:00.000Z	fasta	Lupa	which model?
2012-06-16T14:38:00.000Z	fasta	Lupa	ok, perhaps it does suck.
2012-06-16T14:38:00.000Z	fasta	Lupa	don't buy Asus next time, I suppose.
2012-06-16T14:42:00.000Z	fasta	Lupa	I highly doubt it crashes.
2012-06-16T14:42:00.000Z	fasta	Lupa	I have never reinstalled.
2012-06-16T14:42:00.000Z	fasta	Lupa	well, I did reinstall, but not because of a technical reason.
2012-06-16T14:43:00.000Z	fasta	Lupa	more like a change in requirements.
2012-06-16T14:43:00.000Z	fasta	Lupa	those devices have only a 1GB or RAM or so.
2012-06-16T14:43:00.000Z	fasta	Lupa	you need to be careful as to what you install before it slows down to turtle speed.
2012-06-16T14:44:00.000Z	fasta	Lupa	the CPUs are often also underpowered.
2012-06-16T14:44:00.000Z	fasta	Lupa	in short, they are more like web browser devices, not actual computers.
2012-06-16T14:44:00.000Z	fasta	Lupa	I suggest  you find a friend who knows what he is doing.
2012-06-16T14:45:00.000Z	fasta	Lupa	and or read some information about Linux yourself and get an USB mouse
2012-06-16T14:45:00.000Z	fasta	Lupa	and not buy Asus again; their user support also sucks.
2012-06-16T14:46:00.000Z	fasta	Lupa	it cannot possibly be more amateuristic; I think their website has cost about 2000$ to make or something like that.
