2006-11-15T16:02:00.000Z	Allz		hello in ubuntu .do i have to worry about viruses?
2006-11-15T16:02:00.000Z	LjL	Allz	that's your decision. not many viruses in the wild around for linux though
2006-11-15T16:23:00.000Z	LjL	Allz	BHSPitMonkey, what happened?
2006-11-15T16:30:00.000Z	LjL	Allz	what did you lose in the end?
2006-11-15T16:30:00.000Z	LjL	Allz	if you lost important files, you should probably shut down your machine right now, before the data is overwritten
2006-11-15T16:31:00.000Z	LjL	Allz	well it must be said that you should never blindly type commands without knowing what they do. "man <command>" gives you a page of information about any command - use that
2006-11-15T16:31:00.000Z	LjL	Allz	the Ubuntu Desktop CD is a "live" CD. boot from that
2006-11-15T16:31:00.000Z	LjL	Allz	unless you used the Alternate CD, yes
2006-11-15T16:31:00.000Z	LjL	Allz	yes, reboot into the live CD
2006-11-15T16:47:00.000Z	LjL	Allz	no, just boot from it
2006-11-15T16:49:00.000Z	LjL	Allz	then we see what can be rescued
2006-11-15T16:56:00.000Z	LjL	Allz	first option, "start or install"
2006-11-16T17:02:00.000Z	LjL	Allz	get ubuntu? uh?
2006-11-16T17:02:00.000Z	LjL	Allz	just start the CD
2006-11-16T17:02:00.000Z	LjL	Allz	just like you did when installing it
2006-12-10T06:04:00.000Z	Allz	LjL	are you here?
2006-12-10T07:51:00.000Z	Allz	LjL	are you here?
2006-12-10T07:51:00.000Z	Allz	LjL	are you here?
2006-12-10T09:52:00.000Z	Allz	LjL	are you here?
2006-12-10T09:52:00.000Z	Allz	LjL	are you here?
2006-12-10T09:52:00.000Z	Allz	LjL	are you here?
