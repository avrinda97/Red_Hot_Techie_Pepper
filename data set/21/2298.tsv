2011-08-03T15:45:00.000Z	s7	wols_	that happened when i was trying to install drupal
2011-08-03T15:46:00.000Z	wols_	s7	then next time use the repos

2011-08-03T16:01:00.000Z	wols_	s7	$deity knows what this drupal script broek in your apache2 config by writing all over
2011-08-03T16:02:00.000Z	wols_	s7	since you don't understand the apache2 config I suggest to purge apache, reinstall it and use the drupal6 from the repos in the future
2011-08-03T16:04:00.000Z	s7	wols_	ur right coz it was after the attempted drupal set up that issues started
2011-08-03T16:04:00.000Z	s7	wols_	i will try that
