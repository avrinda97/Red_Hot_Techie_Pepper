2008-05-27T04:40:00.000Z	[GUN]Wires		hey
2008-05-27T04:40:00.000Z	[GUN]Wires		im trying to use a website that has a part that requires the windows media player plugin
2008-05-27T04:40:00.000Z	[GUN]Wires		but I can't install due to not having windows
2008-05-27T04:40:00.000Z	[GUN]Wires		any idea?
2008-05-27T04:41:00.000Z	[GUN]Wires		hmm
2008-05-27T04:41:00.000Z	[GUN]Wires		it says I need a plugin for the online player on xmradio.com though
2008-05-27T04:42:00.000Z	usser	[GUN]Wires	or get rid of totem altogether and sudo apt-get install gnome-mplayer mozilla-mplayer
2008-05-27T04:42:00.000Z	usser	[GUN]Wires	oh that may be harder looks like they use some windows specific plugin
2008-05-27T04:43:00.000Z	usser	[GUN]Wires	im afraid wine is not a solution for this type of problem, why do u want to pay for internet radio anyway?
2008-05-27T04:43:00.000Z	usser	[GUN]Wires	theres plenty of free stations on the net
2008-05-27T04:44:00.000Z	usser	[GUN]Wires	oh i see
2008-05-27T04:44:00.000Z	usser	[GUN]Wires	shoutcast.com
2008-05-27T04:45:00.000Z	usser	[GUN]Wires	over 100000 radiostations
2008-05-27T04:45:00.000Z	usser	[GUN]Wires	that dont require proprietary plugins
2008-05-27T04:48:00.000Z	usser	[GUN]Wires	tar -xvf filename
2008-05-27T04:53:00.000Z	usser	[GUN]Wires	accidently tar -xvf does work for tar.gz files
2008-05-27T04:59:00.000Z	usser	[GUN]Wires	no dont. why?
2008-05-27T04:59:00.000Z	usser	[GUN]Wires	rhytmbox should play it just fine
2008-05-27T05:00:00.000Z	usser	[GUN]Wires	xmms is just way to old, if u want u can have something like it by entering sudo apt-get install audacious on the terminal
2008-05-27T05:00:00.000Z	usser	[GUN]Wires	u dont need xmms
2008-05-27T05:07:00.000Z	usser	[GUN]Wires	listen to fde he
