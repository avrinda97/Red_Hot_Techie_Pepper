2005-09-23T15:38:00.000Z	Gundjah		[LethAL]  - apt-get remove would uninstall, and that's not quite what I want to do yet. Just boot to text mode, and start X manually with some other WM. I'm n00b 'nuff to still need the tools available in the default WM :-)
2005-09-23T15:39:00.000Z	Gundjah		Another stupidity which I simply cannot seem to be able to fix is that Ubuntu doesn't let me use resolution >1024*768 (Gnome, I haven't tested the others yet). What can I do to that?
2005-09-23T15:40:00.000Z	Gundjah		[LethAL]  - killall might work :-) I'll have to try - dirty way but if it works...
2005-09-23T15:42:00.000Z	Gundjah		[LethAL]  - yap. Then I am on text mode - but it's still not the same. Not booting to Gnome by default is what I want to do.
2005-09-23T15:44:00.000Z	Gundjah		[LethAL]  - ... what the funk of a Linux box is it supposed to be, if you canNOT choose your WM???
2005-09-23T15:45:00.000Z	chaosmind	Gundjah	what Ubuntu needs is a runlevel editor, so you can easily edit runlevel 3 (for instance) not to launch GDM
2005-09-23T15:47:00.000Z	chaosmind	Gundjah	enlightenment won't add to the list automatically; see here:  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=46105&highlight=e17
2005-09-23T15:48:00.000Z	Gundjah	chaosmind	- tnx.
2005-09-23T15:48:00.000Z	chaosmind	Gundjah	enlightenment on Ubuntu isn't as easy as it should be; the eLive Cd was a real eye-opener!
2005-09-23T15:50:00.000Z	Gundjah	chaosmind	- how do you mean? I haven't done it before, just BlackBox, and that one runs OK. Albeit I have to build the complete menu system from scratch :-)
2005-09-23T15:51:00.000Z	chaosmind	Gundjah	yeah, if you install BlackBox from Synaptic (or apt-get), it just shows up in the "sessions" menu automagically...
2005-09-23T15:51:00.000Z	chaosmind	Gundjah	but after installing enlightenment that way, I had to follow the wiki instructions to manually create an "e" entry so I could launch e16 (e17 never worked for me).
2005-09-23T15:53:00.000Z	chaosmind	Gundjah	i'm still waiting for the E-Ubuntu fork!  =)
2005-09-23T15:53:00.000Z	Gundjah	chaosmind	- No wonder. I'm trying to keep an old PII in circulation, that's why I need to go lightweight.
2005-09-23T15:54:00.000Z	chaosmind	Gundjah	give the EliveCD a whirl: it's amazing how much eye-candy enlightenment can get out of older hardware!
2005-09-23T15:54:00.000Z	chaosmind	Gundjah	yeah, e17 Ubuntu is my current dream!!
2005-09-23T15:55:00.000Z	Gundjah	chaosmind	- yap. I had a look, and if it delivers what it promises...
2005-09-23T15:56:00.000Z	chaosmind	Gundjah	don't get yer hopes up-- menu editing is still "pulling teeth" in e17... 'least compared to GNOME!
2005-09-23T15:56:00.000Z	Gundjah	chaosmind	- I'd believe there is a manual way to do it, like with BBox.
2005-09-23T15:57:00.000Z	chaosmind	Gundjah	yeah, it's there, but under e17 things are changing quite quickly... heh!  you mean Vista!  ;-)
2005-09-23T15:59:00.000Z	Gundjah	chaosmind	- thought so. Losing it would be agaist the spirit. M$ can keep the one-way-only approach as far as I'm concerned.
