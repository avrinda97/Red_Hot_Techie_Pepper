2008-05-01T04:37:00.000Z	Bizzeh		meh, balls to this, ill stick with vista, when it installs, it actualy boots...
2008-05-01T04:38:00.000Z	euxneks	Bizzeh	good luck with your malware
2008-05-01T04:38:00.000Z	Bizzeh	euxneks	sorry, but im not a total retard, i know how to use a computer, i know how to not get infested with that shite
2008-05-01T04:38:00.000Z	euxneks	Bizzeh	so do I
2008-05-01T04:39:00.000Z	euxneks	Bizzeh	I use linux
2008-05-01T04:39:00.000Z	Bizzeh	euxneks	that just makes you a sheep
2008-05-01T04:40:00.000Z	euxneks	Bizzeh	there are other flavours out there too
2008-05-01T04:40:00.000Z	euxneks	Bizzeh	and, you can do a dual boot
2008-05-01T04:41:00.000Z	euxneks	Bizzeh	try a liveCD though, it might start up, and then you can work from there =)
2008-05-01T04:41:00.000Z	euxneks	Bizzeh	have you tried a liveCD?
2008-05-01T04:46:00.000Z	euxneks	Bizzeh	if it's not ejecting with the button, there should be a little pinhole you can press into to eject CDs
2008-05-01T04:46:00.000Z	euxneks	Bizzeh	with an unfolded paperclip
2008-05-01T04:47:00.000Z	euxneks	Bizzeh	if you're in ubuntu livecd mode, you can just shutdown the computer and it will eject the cd after shutdown
2008-05-01T04:49:00.000Z	euxneks	Bizzeh	another way is to unmount it and then use your CDROM eject button
2008-05-01T04:49:00.000Z	euxneks	Bizzeh	I don't know how well that would work though
2008-05-01T04:50:00.000Z	euxneks	Bizzeh	what about using the liveCD to start the OS on the harddrive?
2008-05-01T04:50:00.000Z	Bizzeh	euxneks	how
2008-05-01T04:50:00.000Z	euxneks	Bizzeh	I think that's one of the options in the boot menu on the ubuntu livecs
2008-05-01T04:50:00.000Z	Bizzeh	euxneks	that just runs the boot loader on the disk
2008-05-01T04:50:00.000Z	euxneks	Bizzeh	oh, ok
2008-05-01T04:51:00.000Z	euxneks	Bizzeh	I found this online: http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-24113.html
