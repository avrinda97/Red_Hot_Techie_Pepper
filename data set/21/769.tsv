2012-11-24T02:45:00.000Z	brainard52		Hello everybody. My audio just quit working, and I was wondering where I would start looking to get information on why it may have stopped. I'm using 12.04 if that helps any.

2012-11-24T02:46:00.000Z	brainard52	usr13	I feel a bit silly now. I don't know why I didn't think about that. Thanks.
2012-11-24T02:57:00.000Z	brainard52	usr13	I figured I'd give you a screenshot. I can see you're helping somebody else atm, so I'll wait until you're finished. http://img195.imageshack.us/img195/6512/alsap.png
2012-11-24T03:18:00.000Z	brainard52	usr13	Thanks for the tip. It's working now. I feel a bit like an idiot, but I haven't had problems in so long, I forgot how to fix things :/

2012-11-24T04:55:00.000Z	usr13	brainard52	play /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav 2>&1 |pastebinit
2012-11-24T04:59:00.000Z	usr13	brainard52	so when you play  /usr/share/sounds/alsa/*  you can hear all the audio files playing through the speakers?  I thought you were having an audion problem.  I guess I have no idea what we were working on here.
2012-11-24T05:01:00.000Z	usr13	brainard52	So when you issue command "play  /usr/share/sounds/alsa/*" ,   you do NOT hear any sounds?
2012-11-24T05:01:00.000Z	usr13	brainard52	And that is the issue that you are trying to solve?
2012-11-24T05:02:00.000Z	usr13	brainard52	uninstall pulseaudio  I guess.  I don't think that's it but won't hurt to find out.
2012-11-24T05:06:00.000Z	usr13	brainard52	did you uninstall pulseaudio?
2012-11-24T05:07:00.000Z	usr13	brainard52	Did you uninstall pulseaudio?
2012-11-24T05:08:00.000Z	usr13	brainard52	just uninstall pulseaudio
2012-11-24T05:08:00.000Z	usr13	brainard52	sudo apt-get remove pulseaudio  #And see if it solves your problem.
2012-11-24T05:09:00.000Z	usr13	brainard52	I doubt that it will  solve anything, but one thing is for sure;  If you don't do anything, you won't fix anything.
2012-11-24T05:10:00.000Z	usr13	brainard52	I gave you one thing to do.
2012-11-24T05:13:00.000Z	usr13	brainard52	Very good.
2012-11-24T05:18:00.000Z	usr13	brainard52	Whasamatter?
2012-11-24T05:19:00.000Z	usr13	brainard52	That is probably because it was part of pulseaudio.  Just use a different mixer.
