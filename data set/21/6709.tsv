2007-02-17T12:25:00.000Z	AlexC_	slippyr4	true, true
2007-02-20T13:42:00.000Z	AlexC_	slippyr4	ubuntu-desktop? it's a Metapackage which basically depends on other packages to install others ... hum, I'm no good at explain things!
2007-02-20T13:44:00.000Z	AlexC_	slippyr4	never tried it, but ... I dunno, try it and see is what I say!
2007-02-22T15:54:00.000Z	AlexC_	slippyr4	oh, never knew that was possible - how do I do that? (xchat)
2007-02-22T15:55:00.000Z	AlexC_	slippyr4	just say AlexC again, please
2007-02-22T15:56:00.000Z	AlexC_	slippyr4	ahh, thanks :P that works good
2007-02-27T12:57:00.000Z	AlexC_	slippyr4	Edit->Preferecenes->Networks->Ubuntu Server->Edit->Nickserv password ....
2007-02-27T12:59:00.000Z	AlexC_	slippyr4	the button on the side, says Edit
2007-02-27T13:02:00.000Z	slippyr4	AlexC_	skar I have a "Settings" menu - no button on the side saying edit?! settings | preferences has a network option, but that has network setup  file transfers tabs, nothing seems to match what you describe.
2007-02-27T13:02:00.000Z	AlexC_	slippyr4	did you install xchat or xchat-gnome ?
2007-02-27T13:02:00.000Z	slippyr4	AlexC_	xchat, not xchat-gnome
2007-02-27T13:03:00.000Z	AlexC_	slippyr4	that could be why, they have different interfaces/buttons in different places
2007-02-27T13:03:00.000Z	slippyr4	AlexC_	why multiple interfaces?
2007-02-27T13:03:00.000Z	slippyr4	AlexC_	is xchat-gnome better? should i install it?
2007-02-27T13:03:00.000Z	AlexC_	slippyr4	different, not multiple. xchat is not xchat-gnome and xchat-gnome is not xchat
2007-02-27T13:03:00.000Z	AlexC_	slippyr4	I always use xchat-gnome ... personal preferences I guess, some like tea some like coffee
2007-02-27T13:05:00.000Z	slippyr4	AlexC_	that leads me to another question - as i look at syaptic, having done a search for xchat, some of the packages (including xchat-gnome) have the ubuntu logo in the second column (next to the selected checkbox). what does that signify here?
2007-02-27T13:05:00.000Z	AlexC_	slippyr4	not sure to be honest, I never use synaptic (I prefer terminal)
2007-02-27T13:06:00.000Z	slippyr4	AlexC_	ok thanks
2007-02-27T13:07:00.000Z	slippyr4	AlexC_	i've now found the option in my version of xchat, so i think i'll stick with this for now
2007-02-27T13:07:00.000Z	AlexC_	slippyr4	ok cool, glad you found it
