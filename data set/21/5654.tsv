2008-10-12T10:15:00.000Z	BobCFC	kr00l	try wine regedit.exe
2008-10-12T10:33:00.000Z	BobCFC	kr00l	try using speech marks for the filename because it has spaces?
2008-10-12T10:35:00.000Z	BobCFC	kr00l	use speech marks for filenames with spaces like chmod 755 "/home/rob/.win/programfiles"
2008-10-12T10:36:00.000Z	kr00l	BobCFC	that didn't do anything
2008-10-12T10:36:00.000Z	kr00l	BobCFC	anyway you can take remote control and look at what i have going on here?
2008-10-12T10:37:00.000Z	BobCFC	kr00l	are you sure the file exists? also it is CASE SEnsitiVE so make sure capital letters are correct
2008-10-12T10:38:00.000Z	BobCFC	kr00l	you can use tab key for autocompletion
2008-10-12T10:38:00.000Z	kr00l	BobCFC	i'm looking at them in my file browser and that's how i got the location
2008-10-12T10:39:00.000Z	BobCFC	kr00l	capitals?
2008-10-12T10:40:00.000Z	BobCFC	kr00l	you need to use speech marks
2008-10-12T10:40:00.000Z	BobCFC	kr00l	there is a space in Program Files
2008-10-12T10:40:00.000Z	kr00l	BobCFC	i have no idea what a speech mark is
2008-10-12T10:40:00.000Z	BobCFC	kr00l	" speech makrs"
2008-10-12T10:41:00.000Z	BobCFC	kr00l	it is seeing the space in words Program Files as a seperation put the whole file in "speechmarks" like this cd "/home/robert/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/CCP/EVE"
2008-10-12T10:42:00.000Z	BobCFC	kr00l	you are not listening
2008-10-12T10:42:00.000Z	kr00l	BobCFC	ok i did the speech marks and now what?
2008-10-12T10:43:00.000Z	BobCFC	kr00l	now you can just do chmod 755 myfile
2008-10-12T10:43:00.000Z	BobCFC	kr00l	in future use speechmarks with chmod and you wont need to cd in to the directory
2008-10-12T10:46:00.000Z	BobCFC	kr00l	what is the name of the file that you want?  type chmod 755 nameoffilethatiwant
2008-10-12T10:52:00.000Z	BobCFC	kr00l	look on the winehq.org website and see if there is a page for your game, it might say use a special version of wine of something?
2008-10-12T10:53:00.000Z	BobCFC	kr00l	http://appdb.winehq.org/ is the page for apps, try searching for your game there
