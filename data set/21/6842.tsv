2007-02-12T09:11:00.000Z	Bieleke		hi guys, i created some tasks that should be started on system startup
2007-02-12T09:11:00.000Z	Bieleke		so i created them in /etc/rc2.d
2007-02-12T09:12:00.000Z	Bieleke		but when i start KSysv, the tasks are listed in runlevel 2, but they are not in the column "Available Services"
2007-02-12T09:12:00.000Z	Bieleke		how can i make sure they are also in that list ?
2007-02-12T09:12:00.000Z	unop	Bieleke	 is that the services-admin utility from the menu?
2007-02-12T09:13:00.000Z	unop	Bieleke	 ahh yea, it's very partial as to what info you get :) best way is to use the rc.d utilities from the command line
2007-02-12T09:14:00.000Z	Bieleke	unop	mmm time to use man rc.d i suppose ?
2007-02-12T09:14:00.000Z	unop	Bieleke	 well, there's a collection of utils .. what are you trying to do now?
2007-02-12T09:16:00.000Z	unop	Bieleke	 well, you should not enable services like that 00 you should place your scripts in /etc/init.d and then use the update-rc.d command
2007-02-12T09:17:00.000Z	unop	Bieleke	 as for getting more services listed in the services-admin util, i dont think there's a way -- as i said, you get all the info you need in a terminal
2007-02-12T09:19:00.000Z	Bieleke	unop	well i've installed xammp for linux and had to create the services by hand
2007-02-12T09:22:00.000Z	Bieleke	unop	yes it is
2007-02-12T09:22:00.000Z	unop	Bieleke	 well, i cant be sure, i've changed things like that around so much, i dont know what the defaults are
2007-02-12T09:25:00.000Z	Bieleke	unop	you can use runlevel command to check it
2007-02-12T09:25:00.000Z	unop	Bieleke	 i just cat /etc/inittab :)
2007-02-12T09:27:00.000Z	Bieleke	unop	there is no /etc/inittab on ubuntu as far as i know
2007-02-12T09:27:00.000Z	unop	Bieleke	 there is if you use sysvinit instead of upstart
2007-02-12T09:28:00.000Z	Bieleke	unop	ah... again learned something
2007-02-12T09:28:00.000Z	Bieleke	unop	what is the difference between those two anyway ?
2007-02-12T09:29:00.000Z	unop	Bieleke	 sysvinit is what the rest of the linux world uses -- the plain old init .. upstart is ubuntu's "enhancement" of it
2007-02-12T09:29:00.000Z	Bieleke	unop	ah ic, did not know that
