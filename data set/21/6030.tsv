2007-07-23T15:29:00.000Z	adv		what's the pkg name for pidgin?
2007-07-23T15:29:00.000Z	rockets	adv	its not in the repositorie
2007-07-23T15:29:00.000Z	rockets	adv	its not in the repositories
2007-07-23T15:30:00.000Z	rockets	adv	get pidgin .deb files here http://www.getdeb.net/
2007-07-23T15:31:00.000Z	adv	rockets	why is it not at the repos?
2007-07-23T15:31:00.000Z	rockets	adv	because Feisty comes with Gaim 2.0.0b6
2007-07-23T15:32:00.000Z	rockets	adv	they dont upgrade packages within a single release unless its necessary to fix a security hole or a MAJOR bug
2007-07-23T15:32:00.000Z	adv	rockets	yes but apt-get install pidgin says there's no such pk
2007-07-23T15:32:00.000Z	rockets	adv	because there IS NO SUCH PACKAGE
2007-07-23T15:32:00.000Z	rockets	adv	get the package from getdeb.net
2007-07-23T15:32:00.000Z	rockets	adv	its not in the apt-get repositories
2007-07-23T15:32:00.000Z	adv	rockets	yes, but why not have it at the repos just in case someone wants it? does it have bugs/probs?
2007-07-23T15:32:00.000Z	rockets	adv	because that would change a whole bunch of dependencies for all sorts of things
2007-07-23T15:33:00.000Z	rockets	adv	thats just not how it works
2007-07-23T15:33:00.000Z	rockets	adv	Ubuntu works so that there can be a seemless upgrade to pidgin just by upgrading your package once gutsy 7.10 comes out
2007-07-23T15:33:00.000Z	rockets	adv	having them both in the repos means installing them side by side which is retarded
2007-07-23T15:34:00.000Z	adv	rockets	but pidgin is the most updated version, anyway
2007-07-23T15:35:00.000Z	rockets	adv	but its not the version that comes with feisty, and version numbers arent changed within one release
2007-07-23T15:35:00.000Z	adv	rockets	k
2007-07-23T15:35:00.000Z	rockets	adv	that maintains stability because the existing packages have been tested by the ubuntu team, while pidgin has NOT been tested by the ubuntu team
2007-07-23T15:35:00.000Z	rockets	adv	and even if you can provide a compelling argument for having them both in the repositories (which you cant) that wont change the fact that it doesn't work that way
