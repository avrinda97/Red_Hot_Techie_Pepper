2005-12-22T12:50:00.000Z	Linuturk		i've shrank my windows partition by 10 gigs, and I plan on installing two distro's of linux on the remaining space. can two distro's of linux use the same swap file?
2005-12-22T12:50:00.000Z	dooglus	Linuturk	it's silly not to
2005-12-22T12:51:00.000Z	dooglus	Linuturk	5 gigs is plenty
2005-12-23T09:03:00.000Z	Linuturk	dooglus	that's only to you :-P
2005-12-23T09:44:00.000Z	dooglus	Linuturk	you're thinking of umask=0 I guess
2005-12-23T09:45:00.000Z	dooglus	Linuturk	a umask is like the numbers that mobus was talking about, but inverted
2005-12-25T07:51:00.000Z	dooglus	Linuturk	you said: "i'm trying to use ndiswrapper, but I've got a problem. I can't tell what *.inf file is associated with my card | hey everyone, I'm trying out ndiswrapper for my MN-520 | but i got some problems | i've followed the guide in the wiki | and I have the utils installed | when I installed the .inf file, it returned cp: cannon stat 'mswpcc.inf': No such file or directory. When I tried it again, it said it was already installed :-/ | i tried m
2005-12-25T07:52:00.000Z	dooglus	Linuturk	I think that's what you said.  I wasn't logging, but I was hanging on your every word.
2005-12-25T07:53:00.000Z	Linuturk	dooglus	thanks
2005-12-25T07:55:00.000Z	dooglus	Linuturk	when you ran "modprobe", did you put "sudo" in front of it?
2005-12-25T07:55:00.000Z	Linuturk	dooglus	yes
2005-12-25T07:55:00.000Z	Linuturk	dooglus	i am using the driver's that my windows xp is using right now
2005-12-25T07:55:00.000Z	dooglus	Linuturk	the error, "operation not permitted" would lead me to think that you might not have.
2005-12-25T07:56:00.000Z	dooglus	Linuturk	try "sudo modprobe ndiswrapper"
2005-12-25T07:56:00.000Z	Linuturk	dooglus	i did it twice, and made sure i did. the first time, i was under sudo su
2005-12-25T07:56:00.000Z	dooglus	Linuturk	and it said "not permitted"?
2005-12-25T07:56:00.000Z	Linuturk	dooglus	right
2005-12-25T07:56:00.000Z	Linuturk	dooglus	i did have the files as read only
2005-12-25T07:57:00.000Z	dooglus	Linuturk	"modprobe" loads a module into the kernel.  nothing needs to have write permission for that.
2005-12-25T07:58:00.000Z	dooglus	Linuturk	I went through this procedure about a month ago for a different wireless card.  it's right that you only have to load the driver into ndiswrapper once, but I didn't have any problem with the 'modprobe' step
2005-12-25T08:00:00.000Z	Linuturk	dooglus	any more thoughts? maybe there is a different driver i need?
