2009-11-15T10:22:00.000Z	Fraxtil		Where would I find logs that tell me about a display-based error?
2009-11-15T10:22:00.000Z	cowbud	Fraxtil	/var/log/X*
2009-11-15T10:24:00.000Z	Fraxtil	cowbud	these logs seem to repeat the same ~100 lines
2009-11-15T10:24:00.000Z	cowbud	Fraxtil	ask what your error is and we can see if we can help you
2009-11-15T10:25:00.000Z	Fraxtil	cowbud	I ran a program, screen became extremely glitched (horizontally offsync, moving the mouse somehow let me control the degree of off-sync-ness, garbage data everywhere), and even after killing the program and gdm, the glitches persisted
2009-11-15T10:25:00.000Z	cowbud	Fraxtil	what program?
2009-11-15T10:25:00.000Z	Fraxtil	cowbud	stepmania
2009-11-15T10:26:00.000Z	cowbud	Fraxtil	what drivers are you running for video?
2009-11-15T10:26:00.000Z	Fraxtil	cowbud	how would I find out? I think it's an integrated Intel chip
2009-11-15T10:27:00.000Z	cowbud	Fraxtil	hrmm well you should have 3d support of sorts with that but that is shaky ground
2009-11-15T10:27:00.000Z	Fraxtil	cowbud	it works fine on windows, and it didn't have graphics errors with 3.9 (i'm now using 4.0 alpha from cvs), so I'm pretty sure the hardware is ok
2009-11-15T10:27:00.000Z	cowbud	Fraxtil	your best bet is to look for info for that app in particular if you are using compiz it might not like that..
2009-11-15T10:37:00.000Z	Fraxtil	cowbud	compiz apparently wasn't the issue, same thing happened while it was disabled
2009-11-15T10:38:00.000Z	cowbud	Fraxtil	hrmm what about an earlier version of the software?
2009-11-15T10:38:00.000Z	Fraxtil	cowbud	the earlier version had pulseaudio glitches, I upgraded to get rid of that
2009-11-15T10:39:00.000Z	cowbud	Fraxtil	hrmm, well running a cvs version though still kind of makes me worry..
2009-11-15T10:39:00.000Z	cowbud	Fraxtil	other people are doing fine?
2009-11-15T10:39:00.000Z	Fraxtil	cowbud	02:05.156: Exception: Fatal I/O error communicating with X server.
2009-11-15T10:40:00.000Z	cowbud	Fraxtil	sounds like a driver issue, which could mean the program is using a "feature" that your card doesn't have..
2009-11-15T10:40:00.000Z	Fraxtil	cowbud	could be, I'll ask around the stepmania forums...
2009-11-15T10:42:00.000Z	cowbud	Fraxtil	yeah sorry we couldn't get further :( the intel cards are a bit of a tossup as far as GL support..
