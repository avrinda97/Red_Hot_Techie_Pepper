2005-12-02T07:34:00.000Z	mustard5	tyrelsouza	apache is avaliable for ubuntu
2005-12-02T07:34:00.000Z	mustard5	tyrelsouza	you need to install it.  It's not installed by default
2005-12-02T07:37:00.000Z	mustard5	tyrelsouza	assuming you have the extra repositories enabled..yes..hang on and I'll find a guide from ubotu

2005-12-02T08:11:00.000Z	mustard5	tyrelsouza	I would use the nvidia drivers in the ubuntu repository
2005-12-02T08:13:00.000Z	mustard5	tyrelsouza	what model is your nvidia card?
2005-12-02T08:14:00.000Z	mustard5	tyrelsouza	same as mine ;)

2005-12-02T08:16:00.000Z	mustard5	tyrelsouza	and you can install nvidia-settings too, which will allow you to play with brightness and gamma settings
2005-12-02T08:18:00.000Z	mustard5	tyrelsouza	k...a few people forget the sudo nvidia-glx-config enable command in the guide, so just remember to do that part too

2005-12-02T08:38:00.000Z	mustard5	tyrelsouza	heh...very strange :)
