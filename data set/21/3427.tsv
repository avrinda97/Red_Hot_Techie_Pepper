2010-04-13T20:12:00.000Z	mcnellis		I'm trying to use usb-creator-gtk to burnt o my 1GB flash drive, but when i click format it doesn't do anything :|
2010-04-13T20:13:00.000Z	mcnellis		when i click format initially it says "DBus error org.gtk.Private.RemoteVolumeMnoitor.NotFound: The given volume was not found"
2010-04-13T20:13:00.000Z	mcnellis		is there an easier way from command line using fdisk or something to format my usb in preparation to install a live iso on it?
2010-04-13T20:14:00.000Z	ikonia	mcnellis	what do you want to do ?
2010-04-13T20:15:00.000Z	mcnellis	ikonia	i want to install ubuntu to my 1gb usb flash drive, but usb-creator-gtk is having trouble formatting the device
2010-04-13T20:16:00.000Z	mcnellis	ikonia	so I'd just like to format the flash device myself
2010-04-13T20:16:00.000Z	ikonia	mcnellis	use fdisk to partition it first of all, is that working ok ?
2010-04-13T20:18:00.000Z	mcnellis	ikonia	you aware of a 2GB min for live usb?
2010-04-13T20:18:00.000Z	ikonia	mcnellis	what do you mean 2GB min ?
2010-04-13T20:20:00.000Z	mcnellis	ikonia	do i format it as fat32?
2010-04-13T20:20:00.000Z	ikonia	mcnellis	you don't install onto fat
2010-04-13T20:21:00.000Z	mcnellis	ikonia	right, but i'm burning a "live cd" to usb? ... does that make a difference? or should I format it ext4?
2010-04-13T20:22:00.000Z	ikonia	mcnellis	you don't format it
2010-04-13T20:22:00.000Z	ikonia	mcnellis	you burn it as an image
2010-04-13T20:24:00.000Z	ikonia	mcnellis	fdisk is just for creating partitions
2010-05-26T14:41:00.000Z	ikonia	mcnellis	livesession is run from ram, it's not an install so not really easy to do, better to do an install
2010-05-26T14:41:00.000Z	mcnellis	ikonia	i've been using a USB key though
2010-05-26T14:43:00.000Z	ikonia	mcnellis	yes,
2010-05-26T14:43:00.000Z	ikonia	mcnellis	what difference does it make, as it doesn't install the "running" session, it installs a clean session
2010-05-26T14:43:00.000Z	ikonia	mcnellis	even if you clicked install from the desktop, it would be a clean install, nothing to do with what you had running at that moment in time
2010-05-26T14:44:00.000Z	ikonia	mcnellis	that is the most straight forward way
