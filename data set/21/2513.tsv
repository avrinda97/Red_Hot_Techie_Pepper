2009-09-20T11:58:00.000Z	pradeep	Ignostic	: chmod -R 777 /path/
2009-09-20T11:58:00.000Z	ankit__		used the repository drivers or downloaded frm nvidia
2009-09-20T11:59:00.000Z	pradeep		ankit_ yes
2009-09-20T11:59:00.000Z	pradeep		ankit_ one which was there in repository,nvidia 180 something
2009-09-20T11:59:00.000Z	ankit__	pradeep	i think u should try to remove the drivers and re compile them
2009-09-20T12:00:00.000Z	ankit__	pradeep	problem lies in the drivers.. its a typical problem associated with driver conflict
2009-09-20T12:00:00.000Z	pradeep		ankit_ I removed them and installed again, but the problem was there
2009-09-20T12:01:00.000Z	ankit__	pradeep	probably u should try some other operating system.. which might solve your problem
