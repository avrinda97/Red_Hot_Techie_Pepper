2007-07-31T13:50:00.000Z	VonGuard		hello
2007-07-31T13:50:00.000Z	VonGuard		i have a daper question
2007-07-31T13:50:00.000Z	VonGuard		i have a laptop with dapper up to date, and it has a seemingly functional cisco aeronet 300 card in it. the card lights, the OS says its there, and the os seems to sign onto the wireless network fine
2007-07-31T13:50:00.000Z	VonGuard		but no connectivity
2007-07-31T13:50:00.000Z	VonGuard		not getting an IP or nothing
2007-07-31T13:51:00.000Z	VonGuard		even though the wireless metter is full
2007-07-31T13:51:00.000Z	VonGuard		and i am on that network with this machine
2007-07-31T13:51:00.000Z	VonGuard		any ideas of what i can try to fix it?
2007-07-31T13:51:00.000Z	VonGuard		ifconfig shows no ip
2007-07-31T13:52:00.000Z	rambo3	VonGuard	what type of card , is firmware installed?
2007-07-31T13:52:00.000Z	VonGuard		cisco aironet 350
2007-07-31T13:52:00.000Z	VonGuard		and it was using an early cisco card before with no troubles
2007-07-31T13:52:00.000Z	VonGuard		firmware?
2007-07-31T13:52:00.000Z	VonGuard		on the card?
2007-07-31T13:54:00.000Z	rambo3	VonGuard	no firmware on this system
2007-07-31T13:54:00.000Z	VonGuard		oh
2007-07-31T13:54:00.000Z	VonGuard		uh... not sure
2007-07-31T13:54:00.000Z	VonGuard		probbaly not up to date
2007-07-31T13:54:00.000Z	VonGuard		not sure how to update either, since it has no floppy drive and only runs dapper
2007-07-31T13:55:00.000Z	rambo3	VonGuard	try googling couse i have other D-Link card and  one more and both need firmware. Google cisco aironet 350  firmware ubuntu
2007-07-31T13:55:00.000Z	VonGuard	rambo3	poop, there's an update, but only for windows
