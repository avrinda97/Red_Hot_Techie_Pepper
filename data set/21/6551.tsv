2007-03-13T06:49:00.000Z	soundray	Xeper	this channel is not for surveys.
2007-03-13T06:49:00.000Z	Xeper	soundray	I'm asking so I can get it to work myself, genius.
2007-03-13T06:50:00.000Z	soundray	Xeper	learn how to ask good questions
2007-03-13T06:51:00.000Z	Xeper	soundray	Bugger off.  Nobody comes here to have some pompous ass spread his "wisdom" though being a jerk unnecessarily.
2007-03-13T06:52:00.000Z	soundray	Xeper	keep on insulting me. Quick way out of here.
2007-03-13T06:59:00.000Z	soundray	Xeper	what makes you think that your chipset causes the problem you're experiencing?
2007-03-13T07:02:00.000Z	Xeper	soundray	Well, it seems the chipset became *kind of* supported with the release of 2.6.20, and a quick Google/forum check led me to believe that I'm not the only one experiencing this problem.  I'm not new to Linux by any means, but I haven't used it in a long time due to being in Iraq.  I came back, built a system, and didn't check to see whether the chipset was supported by Linux -- in the past, all the stuff I've gotten has just worked,
2007-03-13T07:03:00.000Z	soundray	Xeper	is it feisty you're trying to install then? You might be better served in #ubuntu+1
2007-03-13T07:03:00.000Z	Xeper	soundray	Tried both feisty and the current release... no dice on either one.
2007-03-13T07:05:00.000Z	soundray	Xeper	what stage do you get to when you boot?
2007-03-13T07:06:00.000Z	Xeper	soundray	I've gotten to two different stages -- when I plug in my old IDE DVD drive, it will get to the point where I'm supposed to partition disks (that it can't see because they're running on that chipset), and if I'm using the SATA drive, I get to the part where it can't detect my DVD RAM drive.
2007-03-13T07:09:00.000Z	soundray	Xeper	perhaps you can install to a PATA hard disk and compile a kernel with whatever possibly experimental driver you need for the SATA disks.
2007-03-13T07:11:00.000Z	Xeper	soundray	I'd do that, but I really don't want any PATA drives in my system..
2007-03-13T07:11:00.000Z	soundray	Xeper	not even for as long as it takes to get it going?
2007-03-13T07:11:00.000Z	Xeper	soundray	When I get the SATA drive up, won't the install still be on the PATA drive?  I'm lost on that...
2007-03-13T07:12:00.000Z	soundray	Xeper	yes, but you can transfer it and adapt /etc/fstab
2007-03-13T07:13:00.000Z	Xeper	soundray	Hm... sounds like that could cause lots of breakage...
2007-03-13T07:13:00.000Z	soundray	Xeper	it could, but won't if you do it right.
2007-03-13T07:15:00.000Z	soundray	Xeper	compile a kernel .deb with the driver you need. Partition the SATA drive from the PATA installation. Copy the PATA partition contents to the SATA target with a live CD. Chroot the target system and install the kernel .deb and grub. Bob's your uncle.
