2010-08-30T17:41:00.000Z	blue112		Just "bg"
2010-08-30T17:41:00.000Z	blue112	FusionX	you may want to know about screen too.
2010-08-30T17:42:00.000Z	FusionX	blue112	ik but i just want to make the process run in the background, without screen, i also want to know if there's a way to switch between running processes
2010-08-30T17:42:00.000Z	blue112	FusionX	using fg, bg and jobs, you can do it.
2010-08-30T17:42:00.000Z	blue112	FusionX	you can go on #bash for further information :)
2010-08-30T17:43:00.000Z	FusionX	blue112	ok thanks
