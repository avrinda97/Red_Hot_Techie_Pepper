2012-10-31T13:08:00.000Z	almoxarife	BluebirdShao	the right answer to the script is 'yes' all the way till it closes
2012-10-31T13:09:00.000Z	BluebirdShao	almoxarife	I have typed "yes" to all. and it tell me to insert "max6650" to /etc/modules.
2012-10-31T13:10:00.000Z	BluebirdShao	almoxarife	and i can see "max6650" when i typed "lsmod"
2012-10-31T13:11:00.000Z	almoxarife	BluebirdShao	alright, so what is keeping you? what is your desktop?
2012-10-31T13:12:00.000Z	BluebirdShao	almoxarife	but sorry, use "sensors" also display "no sensors found. Make sure you have loaded all the kernel drivers you need."
2012-10-31T13:12:00.000Z	almoxarife	BluebirdShao	first things first, have you placed what ever it asked for where it expected it?

2012-10-31T13:21:00.000Z	almoxarife	BluebirdShao	i assume you have the headers for the kernel installed>?
2012-10-31T13:22:00.000Z	BluebirdShao	almoxarife	you mean this dir: /usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.35-22
2012-10-31T13:23:00.000Z	almoxarife	BluebirdShao	there are two header packages for the kernel, do you have both?
2012-10-31T13:27:00.000Z	BluebirdShao	almoxarife	yes. one is "linux-headers-2.6.35-22-generic" and another is "linux-headers-2.6.35-22"
