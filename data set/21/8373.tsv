2006-04-28T09:04:00.000Z	ferronica		unable to edit menu.list
2006-04-28T09:04:00.000Z	ferronica		ok
2006-04-28T09:05:00.000Z	beta_m	ferronica	 who are you trying to edit it?
2006-04-28T09:06:00.000Z	beta_m	ferronica	 i'm getting lost in what you are asking, is the file not opening, or is it opening read only?
2006-04-28T09:06:00.000Z	beta_m	ferronica	 phace tells you how to open it if you have the latter problem
2006-04-28T09:09:00.000Z	beta_m	ferronica	 i don't even know what getedit is, but do what phace told you
2006-04-28T09:09:00.000Z	beta_m	ferronica	 go to the terminal, and change to the directory where menu.list is
2006-04-28T09:11:00.000Z	beta_m	ferronica	ok do this: go to terminal and type "gksudo gedit"
2006-04-28T09:11:00.000Z	beta_m	ferronica	it is *the only way* to do this...
2006-04-28T09:12:00.000Z	beta_m	ferronica	 did you do that?
2006-04-28T09:14:00.000Z	beta_m	ferronica	 you should have had the password prompt, did you type your password there?
2006-04-28T09:15:00.000Z	beta_m	ferronica	type this "gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.list" (without quotes) and type pass when asked
2006-04-28T09:16:00.000Z	beta_m	ferronica	 what do you mean "not whole"
2006-04-28T09:18:00.000Z	beta_m	ferronica	 go into "File->open" and open it that way
2006-04-28T09:18:00.000Z	beta_m	ferronica	 you should be able to edit any file this way
2006-04-28T09:18:00.000Z	beta_m	ferronica	 gksudo gives you permissions to do anything in the graphical programme
2006-04-28T09:20:00.000Z	beta_m	ferronica	 i think you've done something differently then
2006-04-28T09:25:00.000Z	beta_m	ferronica	 what are you typing when you get "command not found"
2006-04-28T09:25:00.000Z	beta_m	ferronica	 file should be called menu.lst
