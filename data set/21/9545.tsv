2005-09-01T06:44:00.000Z	Drajka		I can't even log in dude
2005-09-01T06:44:00.000Z	Drajka		=/
2005-09-01T06:45:00.000Z	Drajka		I've never even been logged into linux. Ever. In my life. Let alone be able to install drivers.
2005-09-01T06:45:00.000Z	Drajka		:o
2005-09-01T06:46:00.000Z	Drajka		meh
2005-09-01T06:46:00.000Z	Drajka		;/
2005-09-01T06:47:00.000Z	Drajka		for a first time linux user.. I"m certainly not seeing linux in a loving light :[
2005-09-01T06:47:00.000Z	Drajka		There's a difference between perfection and not working at all
2005-09-01T06:47:00.000Z	Drajka		:P
2005-09-01T06:48:00.000Z	Ng	Drajka	do you know what kind of graphics card you have?
2005-09-01T06:48:00.000Z	Drajka	Ng	I'm a linux n00b, not a computer n00b ;)
2005-09-01T06:50:00.000Z	Ng	Drajka	ok, well when X has failed to load you should still be able to get console logins, which will let you fix this if you want to? It could be that the 6600 is too new for the basic nvidia driver included
2005-09-01T06:51:00.000Z	Ng	Drajka	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia - read that - the only difference is that you can't use synaptic, so to install nvidia-glx you need to log in to the console and do "sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx"
2005-09-01T06:52:00.000Z	Ng	Drajka	you can find out by rebooting into recovery mode and running "grep 1000 /etc/passwd" (the first part is the username), then you can reset the password for it with "passwd yourusername"
2005-09-01T06:53:00.000Z	Ng	Drajka	hmm?
2005-09-01T06:54:00.000Z	Ng	Drajka	It'll look like this: cmsj:x:1000:1000:Chris Jones,,,:/home/cmsj:/bin/bash
2005-09-01T06:54:00.000Z	Ng	Drajka	it should do
2005-09-01T06:55:00.000Z	Ng	Drajka	good luck :)
2005-09-01T06:55:00.000Z	Ng	Drajka	I'm expecting success ;)
2005-09-01T07:12:00.000Z	Ng	Drajka	you can find out by rebooting into recovery mode and running "grep 1000 /etc/passwd" (the first part is the username), then you can reset the password for it with "passwd yourusername"
