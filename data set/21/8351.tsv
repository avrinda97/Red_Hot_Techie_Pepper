2007-06-29T06:27:00.000Z	ali1234	dotdashandy	you can install 7.04 in text mode
2007-06-29T06:27:00.000Z	dotdashandy	ali1234	I know, the option is there.
2007-06-29T06:28:00.000Z	dotdashandy	ali1234	The real trick is trying to get it to boot IN to text mode. No matter what I tried, the statements that I use to get 5.10 running didn't work
2007-06-29T06:29:00.000Z	ali1234	dotdashandy	well assuming you dont mind waiting a looong time, just use the gnome services applet thingy to disable gdm service. then it will only boot up to text mode from that point...
2007-06-29T06:29:00.000Z	dotdashandy	ali1234	Waiting a long time isn't an option anymore. I've got to pass the right statements in order to get into the text mode first anyway, before all this
2007-06-29T06:30:00.000Z	ali1234	dotdashandy	then boot into single user mode / recovery mode and delete /etc/init.d/gdm
2007-06-29T06:30:00.000Z	dotdashandy	ali1234	because I can't boot past bash right now, it all fails and drops me to an emergency terminal, or it hangs and then I have to hard reboot
2007-06-29T06:31:00.000Z	dotdashandy	ali1234	Is it possible to start a text install from single user mode?
2007-06-29T06:31:00.000Z	ali1234		dont know. i only know the pxe method
2007-06-29T06:31:00.000Z	dotdashandy	ali1234	This machine is too old for pxe, I tried that a few hours back
2007-06-29T06:32:00.000Z	ali1234		use a grub floppy
2007-06-29T06:32:00.000Z	dotdashandy	ali1234	Laptop has no floppy drive.
2007-06-29T06:32:00.000Z	ali1234		gah
2007-06-29T06:33:00.000Z	dotdashandy	ali1234	and it can't boot from USB volumes, so that rules out my USB floppy and any usb key
2007-06-29T06:34:00.000Z	ali1234	dotdashandy	remove the HD and install pxe capable grub on it
2007-06-29T06:34:00.000Z	dotdashandy	ali1234	The only way I could do that was through my dad's laptop which would be impossible seeing as I would like this machine to take with me tomorrow.
2007-06-29T06:35:00.000Z	dotdashandy	ali1234	I might just stick with 5.10 and the OpenOffice it comes with, or just scrap it and go to Windows 2000 and Office until I can get something sorted out
2007-06-29T06:36:00.000Z	ali1234	dotdashandy	actually you shouldnt need to remove the HD to install pxe capable grub if you already have 5.10 installed
2007-06-29T06:37:00.000Z	dotdashandy	ali1234	Well 5.10 is on there, and i'm 83% through the Configuration right now
2007-06-29T06:37:00.000Z	ali1234		for that matter, the grub that comes with ubuntu might have network support compiled in
2007-06-29T06:37:00.000Z	dotdashandy	ali1234	the only problem is my ethernet wasn't detected
