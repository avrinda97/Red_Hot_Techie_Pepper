2007-05-13T12:25:00.000Z	kalpik	SlicerDicer-	i can try ;)
2007-05-13T12:26:00.000Z	SlicerDicer-	kalpik	I am trying to use the alternate installer to do software raid stuff
2007-05-13T12:26:00.000Z	kalpik	SlicerDicer-	i dont know much about RAID, worked with LVM though.. anyhow, what's the si
2007-05-13T12:27:00.000Z	SlicerDicer-	kalpik	thats my problem
2007-05-13T12:28:00.000Z	kalpik	SlicerDicer-	aah.. im sorry but im not the right person to guide you on that :)
2007-05-13T12:28:00.000Z	SlicerDicer-	kalpik	hehe its like pulling teeth finding somebody :)
2007-05-13T12:30:00.000Z	SlicerDicer-	kalpik	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bug/112444 thats my problem with graphical installer
2007-05-13T12:31:00.000Z	kalpik	SlicerDicer-	hmm..
2007-05-13T12:33:00.000Z	kalpik	SlicerDicer-	i know.. why dont you post it at the forums.. forums are better for detailed help..
2007-05-13T12:35:00.000Z	SlicerDicer-	kalpik	I may I dont know I am still considering if its worth it to transition the box off of gentoo or not I mean it works fine with gentoo I just wanted to make it easier
2007-05-13T12:36:00.000Z	kalpik	SlicerDicer-	gentoo is a great distro.. but yeah i also see no point in making it difficult and time consuming :|
2007-05-13T12:37:00.000Z	SlicerDicer-	kalpik	well truth be told ubuntu friggin sucks in the raid department... I mean badly however it was quite simple with gentoo I was hoping I could do something but its been nonstop headbashing for the past 9 hours lol
2007-05-13T12:38:00.000Z	kalpik	SlicerDicer-	yes.. Feisty alternate CD is having problems with LVM too! takes about 3 mins per partition to activate a volume group
2007-05-13T12:39:00.000Z	SlicerDicer-	kalpik	I dont get it at all... why such shitty support for raid and such? its enough to make my head spin.... Is Ubuntu really wanting to run off anybody who does anything halfway sane like redundency? it truly boggles my mind
2007-05-13T12:40:00.000Z	kalpik	SlicerDicer-	i dunno! the daily CDs were fine! they just messed up the final ISOs :P
2007-05-13T12:40:00.000Z	SlicerDicer-	kalpik	raid has always been a issue LVM is easy
2007-05-13T12:41:00.000Z	kalpik	SlicerDicer-	aah.. i have no idea about RAID.. so cant really say :)
2007-05-13T12:43:00.000Z	SlicerDicer-	kalpik	well thanks for listening to me vent :) I love ubuntu but I hate some of the "complacent" shit about it more worried about nvidia drivers than redundency blah! on that note I am going to go put my head through a wall ;-)
2007-05-13T12:43:00.000Z	kalpik	SlicerDicer-	hehe not a problem :) we all need to vent sometimes! take care! :)
2007-05-13T12:44:00.000Z	SlicerDicer-	kalpik	you too
