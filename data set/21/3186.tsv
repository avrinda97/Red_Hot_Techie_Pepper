2009-03-08T01:39:00.000Z	jatt		hi when I configure my host
2009-03-08T01:39:00.000Z	jatt		I cannot start any X application, for instance xclock shows:
2009-03-08T01:39:00.000Z	jatt		Error: Can't open display: :0.0
2009-03-08T01:39:00.000Z	jatt		what can be the problem?
2009-03-08T01:40:00.000Z	hubertb_	jatt	what happens if you're connecting to the internet and afterwards start X?
2009-03-08T01:41:00.000Z	jatt		well I am working on X now I switch the hostname so leafnode (a local newsserver I use) can run, and m.no-ip.org resolves fine because I am registered with no-ip.org
2009-03-08T01:41:00.000Z	jatt		So I am connected to the internet right now
2009-03-08T01:41:00.000Z	jatt		of course :)
2009-03-08T01:42:00.000Z	hubertb_	jatt	what's the hostname you're currently using?
2009-03-08T01:43:00.000Z	hubertb_	jatt	in order to get x running
2009-03-08T01:43:00.000Z	jatt		when I use dell-desktop (which has an entry in /etc/hosts for 127.0.0.1) X applications can be started
2009-03-08T01:43:00.000Z	jatt		at this moment I am using m.no-ip.org
2009-03-08T01:44:00.000Z	hubertb_	jatt	and m.no-ip.org can be resolved when running in console-only?
2009-03-08T01:44:00.000Z	jatt		with m.no-ip.org my leafnode server works, but I cannot start X application, when I switch to dell-desktop X-applications start but leafnode not
2009-03-08T01:44:00.000Z	jatt	hubertb_	m.no-ip.org can always be resolved
2009-03-08T01:44:00.000Z	jatt		I am running X all the time
2009-03-08T01:45:00.000Z	hubertb_	jatt	strange issue %-)
2009-03-08T01:45:00.000Z	jatt		yes :) I just wanted to avoid typing hostname m.mandala.no-ip.org and hostname dell-desktop back and forth
2009-03-08T01:45:00.000Z	hubertb_	jatt	have you tried putting m.no-ip.org in /etc/hosts on that box (resolving to maybe 127.0.0.1)?
2009-03-08T01:45:00.000Z	jatt	hubertb_	I haven't I will try that
2009-03-08T01:45:00.000Z	hubertb_	jatt	it's just a guess, I'm not quite sure what's causing the problem
