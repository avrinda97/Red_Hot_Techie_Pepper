2009-06-08T23:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tavi	no
2009-06-08T23:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tavi	also Yahoo...  now I have a story,   I used to be rather loyal to them untill that,   pm if your interested
2009-06-08T23:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tavi	maybe a development version of Pidgin does web cam, but I am not sure
2009-06-08T23:54:00.000Z	tavi	sebsebseb	what is the latest version of pidgin?
2009-06-08T23:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tavi	yeah there's the oen in Ubuntu, but   you can probably get a ppa for even later,  and then of course compile your own
2009-06-08T23:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tavi	,but  I don't even know if those versions have web cam suppourt
2009-06-08T23:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tavi	I think they might,  ask in #pidgin
2009-06-08T23:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tavi	well Yahoo and Linux is hummm,  but  Yahoo  aren't that good anyway
2009-06-08T23:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tavi	I meant web cam and Yahoo
2009-06-08T23:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tavi	webcam and Yahoo is  hummm on Linux,  as in  maybe not really any programs that do it,   also I personally don't like Yahoo that much anymore, but that's something else
2009-06-08T23:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tavi	why must you have web cam suppourt on Yahoo?
2009-06-09T00:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tavi	if  it is so important another solution could be this.   to run Windows in a virtual machine for Yahoo Messenger,  and as long as your computer has enough RAM.   also maybe Yahoo Messenger and Wine if you configure, as far as I know it won't just work in Wine
2009-06-09T00:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tavi	nah that's clever, and  vm's are pretty sweet really :)
2009-06-09T00:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tavi	Virtualbox is one of the programs that do them, and it's great
