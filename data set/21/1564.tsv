2010-07-25T05:23:00.000Z	Chaorain		I'm having  some problems. I have a Dell Xps M1730 and I can't get the wifi to work. "rfkill List" says that the device is hardware disabled. Is there anything I can do about this?

2010-07-25T05:51:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Chaorain	yes, press it and keep it until the indicators lights up
2010-07-25T05:53:00.000Z	Chaorain	ilovefairuz	the wifi light does flash, The bluetooth is also controlled by this swith and it stays on, if that makes a difference
2010-07-25T05:54:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Chaorain	so the indicator is on but no difference?
2010-07-25T05:54:00.000Z	Chaorain	ilovefairuz	Bluetooth: yes Wifi: no

2010-07-25T06:30:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Chaorain	try .. Â sudo echo 0 > /sys/class/net/wlan0/device/rf_kill ... sudo ifconfig wlan0 up ... iwlist wlan0 scan... this should show you available networks.. if not, it could be a hardware issue https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/230844
2010-07-25T06:31:00.000Z	Chaorain	ilovefairuz	Alright, I'll give it a try
2010-07-25T06:31:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Chaorain	sudo su -, and type the commands without sudo
