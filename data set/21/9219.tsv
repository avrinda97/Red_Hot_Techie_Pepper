2006-02-23T10:14:00.000Z	lupz	mcphail	well i followed the wiki page...
2006-02-23T10:14:00.000Z	mcphail	lupz	install the .deb fro the seveas repo
2006-02-23T10:21:00.000Z	mcphail	lupz	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Skype
2006-02-24T07:26:00.000Z	mcphail	lupz	i've had this issue with usb drives and all udev-using distros
2006-02-24T07:28:00.000Z	lupz	mcphail	it is an ide drive though..
2006-02-24T07:28:00.000Z	mcphail	lupz	i know, but sounds like the sam problem: need to access the device before udev sets it up
2006-02-24T07:28:00.000Z	mcphail	lupz	i'd file a bug for this one
2006-02-24T07:29:00.000Z	lupz	mcphail	what should i do to workaround ?
2006-02-24T07:30:00.000Z	mcphail	lupz	i think you can edit the init scripts to do a "wait" while udev gets itself together. Beyong my abilities I'm afraid.
2006-02-24T07:30:00.000Z	lupz	mcphail	well the problem is that it doesn't mount it at all..
2006-02-24T07:31:00.000Z	mcphail	lupz	yes, but you can edit them using a live cd for example
2006-02-24T07:31:00.000Z	lupz	mcphail	i'm quite sure that the problem has been with the dist-upgrade from breezy to dapper.. should i check the state of some packages?
2006-02-24T07:32:00.000Z	lupz	mcphail	the breezy kernel boots flawlessy so i think that udev isn't correctly updated
2006-02-24T07:32:00.000Z	mcphail	lupz	sure. Just be aware that dapper isn't ready yet. if this is you main box, use breezy
2006-02-24T07:32:00.000Z	lupz	mcphail	well yes, i'm ready to have some problems...
2006-02-24T07:32:00.000Z	lupz	mcphail	anyway any suggestion ?
2006-02-24T07:33:00.000Z	mcphail	lupz	i honestly think this is a udev problem. Google your error message and you'll get plenty of hits
2006-02-24T07:34:00.000Z	lupz	mcphail	a does not exist error is quite difficult to google :)
2006-02-24T07:34:00.000Z	mcphail	lupz	i've googled it before
2006-02-24T07:34:00.000Z	lupz	mcphail	i'm trying thanks :)
