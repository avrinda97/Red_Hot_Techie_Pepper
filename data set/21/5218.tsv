2010-03-22T04:44:00.000Z	upfwnv03	PeterT	could put them in a restricted shell.
2010-03-22T04:44:00.000Z	PeterT	upfwnv03	what command would that be?
2010-03-22T04:57:00.000Z	upfwnv03	PeterT	you could try rssh
2010-03-22T04:58:00.000Z	PeterT	upfwnv03	what's that?
2010-03-22T04:59:00.000Z	upfwnv03	PeterT	restricted shell. A restricted shell is a Unix shell that has been modified to allow the Unix shell user to do fewer things than a normal shell would allow him to do. Restricted shells allow you to control the user’s environment allowing only specific admin-aproved commands.
2010-03-22T05:00:00.000Z	PeterT	upfwnv03	where can I install this?
2010-03-22T05:15:00.000Z	upfwnv03	PeterT	this may be more helpful. A restricted shell is used to set up an environment more controlled than the standard shell.Bash shell can be opened in restricted mode. If bash shell is started with the name rbash, or the --restricted or -r option is supplied at invocation, it is opened as a restricted shell.
2010-03-22T05:16:00.000Z	PeterT	upfwnv03	I don't know how that helps me
2010-03-22T05:16:00.000Z	PeterT	upfwnv03	so I have to make the person logging in use -r?
2010-03-22T05:17:00.000Z	upfwnv03	PeterT	You can’t change directories using cd command. That way your user(s) would be kept to /home/<username>
2010-03-22T05:17:00.000Z	upfwnv03	PeterT	I think you would put it in their .bashrc file
2010-03-22T05:17:00.000Z	PeterT	upfwnv03	How do I make the bash they connect to restricted?
2010-03-22T05:17:00.000Z	PeterT	upfwnv03	ok
2010-03-22T05:19:00.000Z	upfwnv03	PeterT	here is the link where I found rbash. http://linuxandfriends.com/2008/09/07/bash-restricted-shell/
2010-03-22T05:20:00.000Z	PeterT		thanks upfwnv03
2010-03-22T05:23:00.000Z	upfwnv03	PeterT	might I also suggest open a terminal window and use man bash. This will give you a manual page on bash. It is however rather lengthy.
2010-03-22T05:24:00.000Z	PeterT	upfwnv03	right, I'm on SSH
2010-03-22T05:24:00.000Z	upfwnv03	PeterT	very good.
