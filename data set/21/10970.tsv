2004-09-18T06:13:00.000Z	daniels		i can't file a bug with bugzilla because my mouse doesn't work right now, but could someone please file a critical bug on pfaedit
2004-09-18T06:13:00.000Z	daniels		given that it currently only contains /usr/share/doc/pfaedit
2004-09-18T06:13:00.000Z	daniels		assign it to me
2004-09-18T06:14:00.000Z	daniels		er, nevermind
2004-09-18T06:15:00.000Z	daniels		hm. fontforge conflicts/replaces pfaedit, but doesn't provide a pfaedit binary

2004-09-18T06:16:00.000Z	Hrdwr_BoB	daniels	goes on to die at the next zebra crossing </obscure hhgtg reference>
2004-09-18T06:21:00.000Z	daniels	Hrdwr_BoB	i was making the same reference
2004-09-19T07:50:00.000Z	Hrdwr_BoB	daniels	my vnc cpu usage issue makes using VNC almost entirely pointless as it grinds the whole thing to a halt - should I file a bug or ...?
2004-09-19T07:50:00.000Z	daniels	Hrdwr_BoB	tempting to say 'don't do that, then'
2004-09-19T07:55:00.000Z	daniels	Hrdwr_BoB	and your monitor advertises 1280x960 as well, god knows how it deals with that
2004-09-19T07:55:00.000Z	daniels	Hrdwr_BoB	i mean, we do n-1 so people have a good-looking display, but we really can't protect against monitors blatantly lying
2004-09-20T06:58:00.000Z	Hrdwr_BoB	daniels	where's the fruitfucker? :)
2004-09-20T06:59:00.000Z	daniels	Hrdwr_BoB	the iBook I had during lca was fruitfucker2000, actually
2004-09-20T07:00:00.000Z	daniels	Hrdwr_BoB	so, I was standing in some homewares shop in Brunswick St, and I saw a Fruit Reamer, that was blurbing about how good it could ream the pulp
2004-09-20T07:01:00.000Z	Hrdwr_BoB	daniels	ehehehe
2004-09-27T09:28:00.000Z	daniels	Hrdwr_BoB	hm, should be quicker from fooishbar
2004-09-27T09:28:00.000Z	daniels	Hrdwr_BoB	got somewhere I can scp it to?
2004-09-27T09:28:00.000Z	Hrdwr_BoB	daniels	hm?
