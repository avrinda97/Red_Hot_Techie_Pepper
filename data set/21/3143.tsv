2009-07-27T17:43:00.000Z	fivetwentysix		Is there anyway I can make .pyc files hidden?
2009-07-27T17:43:00.000Z	iceroot	fivetwentysix	start filename with "."
2009-07-27T17:43:00.000Z	fivetwentysix	iceroot	they don't start with .,
2009-07-27T17:44:00.000Z	fivetwentysix	iceroot	You know what pyc files are right?
2009-07-27T17:44:00.000Z	iceroot	fivetwentysix	.thisishidde.pyc  thisisnothidden.pyc
2012-04-19T11:23:00.000Z	iceroot	fivetwentysix	/dev/sdc is the device
2012-04-19T11:23:00.000Z	iceroot	fivetwentysix	/dev/sdc1 is the partition
2012-04-19T11:24:00.000Z	fivetwentysix	iceroot	really? tehre's no sdc1
2012-04-19T11:24:00.000Z	iceroot	fivetwentysix	a device never has a file-system, just the partitions like /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdc5 and so on
2012-04-19T11:24:00.000Z	iceroot	fivetwentysix	then the drive dont have partitions or the partition table is broken
2012-04-19T11:25:00.000Z	fivetwentysix	iceroot	so what do i do in the case the partition table is broken?
2012-04-19T11:25:00.000Z	fivetwentysix	iceroot	I know sdc is the right devise, because I unplugged it and replugged it
2012-04-19T11:25:00.000Z	iceroot	fivetwentysix	you have a backup of the partition-table (dd dump from the drive? you need the first 512bytes of that dump"
2012-04-19T11:27:00.000Z	fivetwentysix	iceroot	so how do i use dd
2012-04-19T11:27:00.000Z	iceroot	fivetwentysix	you have already a dump from that drive? (a backup) if not  that is bad
2012-04-19T11:28:00.000Z	iceroot	fivetwentysix	you cant make a backup later from an already broken drive
2012-04-19T11:28:00.000Z	fivetwentysix	iceroot	no i dont
2012-04-19T11:28:00.000Z	iceroot	fivetwentysix	then your partitions are gone
2012-04-19T11:30:00.000Z	fivetwentysix	iceroot	there's nothing i can try?
2012-04-19T11:31:00.000Z	iceroot	fivetwentysix	you can create an exact same partition layout on another drive and copy that to your drive but if you dont know the exact size of the partitions, there startlocation and so on i dont think you can do something
2012-04-19T11:31:00.000Z	iceroot	fivetwentysix	always a good idea to have a backup
