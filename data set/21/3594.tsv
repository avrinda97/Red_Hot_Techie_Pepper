2009-02-21T07:07:00.000Z	f_newton	hmw	opinionated children should not get you upset
2009-02-21T07:07:00.000Z	hmw	f_newton	- i didnt get upset. i usually do not use away nicks. my answer was meant, as i typed it. *g*
2009-02-21T07:08:00.000Z	hmw	f_newton	using away nicks floods the channel, thats why they dont want us to use such here.
2009-02-21T07:09:00.000Z	hmw	f_newton	- if i change my nick, it will show up in this chat. thats the "flood"
2009-02-21T10:09:00.000Z	hmw	f_newton	- what?
2009-02-21T10:16:00.000Z	f_newton	hmw	you know what.... I find most of linux runs pretty good until people start messing with it
2009-02-21T10:17:00.000Z	hmw	f_newton	linux shouldnt be used with a mouse
2009-02-21T10:18:00.000Z	f_newton	hmw	I love my mouse
2009-02-21T10:22:00.000Z	f_newton	hmw	you have  sounds enabled???
2009-02-21T10:23:00.000Z	hmw	f_newton	i use a console irc client, its the pc speaker beep
2009-02-21T10:24:00.000Z	f_newton	hmw	using irrsi or bitchx?
2009-02-21T10:24:00.000Z	hmw	f_newton	a derivate of irssi - "epic"
2009-02-21T10:25:00.000Z	f_newton	hmw	I use xchat in a large screen display
2009-02-21T10:27:00.000Z	hmw	f_newton	in my opinion, interpreter languages are programming languages as well
2009-02-21T10:41:00.000Z	hmw	f_newton	gotu - saving time (or saving my nerves) is a legitimate reason for "cowardish" reinstalling the whole sys. i do it, too.
2009-02-21T10:54:00.000Z	f_newton	hmw	thats not fair... vista aero is designed to run on a 3gig machine with at least 2gigs of dual channel ram
2009-02-21T10:55:00.000Z	hmw	f_newton	- one has to wonder why. compiz is quite the same and runs on 800MHz/1GB
2009-02-21T10:57:00.000Z	f_newton	hmw	well i have a 3gig machine w/ 2gigs dual channel ram and a 256 ddr video card and compiz runs like crap on my box
2009-02-21T10:57:00.000Z	hmw	f_newton	- ATI?
