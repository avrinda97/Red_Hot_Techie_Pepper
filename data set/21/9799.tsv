2005-07-07T15:42:00.000Z	gardenia		I see that nvidia drivers in breezy aren't working but i presume they  can be source compiled right ?
2005-07-07T15:44:00.000Z	Michel	gardenia	Praise be given to NVidia for their Linux support!
2005-07-07T15:45:00.000Z	gardenia	Michel	well almost..looks like ATI beat them to a X installable driver though..how lame is that ?
2005-07-07T15:45:00.000Z	Michel	gardenia	How so? Not sure what you mean.
2005-07-07T15:47:00.000Z	Michel	gardenia	I installed the nvidia drivers on ubuntu without having to exit X
2005-07-07T15:47:00.000Z	gardenia	Michel	yes ubuntu makes it painelsss mostly..but not all distros offer this luxury
2005-07-07T15:48:00.000Z	Michel	gardenia	I was quite pleased wth ubuntu. I come from a SuSE background as of late.
2005-07-07T15:49:00.000Z	gardenia	Michel	wow suse huh..one of the easiest to use distros period
2005-07-07T15:50:00.000Z	gardenia	Michel	I was not overall pleased with their IRC channel..seems kinda childish sometimes but here they keep things decent I find
2005-07-07T15:50:00.000Z	Michel	gardenia	agreed and there are still things that I think are better on SuSE (like access to removable media) but I was getting problem on my laptop after a while. Things would disappear and the removable media feature would stop working.
2005-07-07T15:50:00.000Z	gardenia	Michel	yeah ubuntu rocks for me except for my dain X crashing...I dont know how to solve so im thinking to try breezy and cross fingers LOL
2005-07-07T15:51:00.000Z	Michel	gardenia	never have had X crashing in 10 years :)
2005-07-07T15:51:00.000Z	gardenia	Michel	hoary ?
2005-07-07T15:52:00.000Z	gardenia	Michel	hmm well maybe i'm running into some bad ram or something equally depressing ..seems unlikely on this 2.5 year old dell but its possible ..bigtime sorrow of true..but I do see others have weird issues with gnome though
2005-07-07T15:52:00.000Z	gardenia	Michel	ah ok
2005-07-07T15:52:00.000Z	Michel	gardenia	I do not use gnome. Coming from suse, I installed KDE
2005-07-07T15:52:00.000Z	gardenia	Michel	I love ubuntu though so its worth sticking with and making better if need be
2005-07-07T15:52:00.000Z	gardenia	Michel	true
2005-07-07T15:53:00.000Z	Michel	gardenia	I do not quite get the gnome desktop. Can't get used to it....
2005-07-07T15:54:00.000Z	gardenia	Michel	ah ok..well if you like kde I can understand..two totally different DE'
2005-07-07T15:57:00.000Z	gardenia	Michel	heheh
