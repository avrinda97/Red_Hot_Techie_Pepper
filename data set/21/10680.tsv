2006-04-05T16:06:00.000Z	Seikima_		I'm at my wits' with this networking stuff in Ubuntu.  Unfortunately I'm about ready to just scrap the whole thing and go back to Windows...  :/
2006-04-05T16:07:00.000Z	Seikima_		I'm trying to get my internet to work, and I've spent upwards of 10 hours reading the forums, to no avail.
2006-04-05T16:08:00.000Z	Seikima_		No, I have a cable modem.
2006-04-05T16:08:00.000Z	Seikima_		Yes.
2006-04-05T16:09:00.000Z	Seikima_		It's a D-Link, and my IP is on a DMZ, so all ports or open.
2006-04-05T16:09:00.000Z	Seikima_		Problem is that I can't even get to that point.  So far I haven't even been able to ping the router.
2006-04-05T16:10:00.000Z	davidmcq	Seikima_	.. you are very trusting :)
2006-04-05T16:11:00.000Z	davidmcq	Seikima_	go to system/administration/networking - is your ethernet active?
2006-04-05T16:12:00.000Z	davidmcq	Seikima_	have you checked the configuration? is it set up for dhcp?
2006-04-05T16:13:00.000Z	davidmcq	Seikima_	like arrick said... type ifconfig in a console...
2006-04-05T16:14:00.000Z	davidmcq	Seikima_	... dhcp is better assuming your router is working properly
2006-04-05T16:16:00.000Z	davidmcq	Seikima_	.. .if you've been working on it for hours you are on the wrong track.. best to take a break.. go cuddle your girlfriend for a while :)
2006-04-05T16:17:00.000Z	davidmcq	Seikima_	... ubuntu networking is usually pretty good.. when you find the problem it will be pretty simple
2006-04-05T16:21:00.000Z	davidmcq	Seikima_	... sounds like you are not talking to the router...
2006-04-05T16:22:00.000Z	davidmcq	Seikima_	is the ip number all 000?
2006-04-05T16:23:00.000Z	davidmcq	Seikima_	... ip v6?
2006-04-05T16:23:00.000Z	davidmcq	Seikima_	that is possibly your problem
2006-04-05T16:24:00.000Z	davidmcq	Seikima_	.. i can't remember .. but i think you can switch that off
2006-04-05T16:24:00.000Z	davidmcq	Seikima_	... your router probably only speaks ip v4
2006-04-05T16:25:00.000Z	davidmcq	Seikima_	.. i'm not expert.. but i vaguely recall reading something about having to turn off ip v6
2006-04-05T16:25:00.000Z	davidmcq	Seikima_	.. hunt around networking configs, ask here.. or try Mr.Google
