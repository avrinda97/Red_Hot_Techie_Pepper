2006-10-10T06:53:00.000Z	mnepton	DethKlok	it's also not a good idea to take things too personally, in my experience.
2006-10-10T06:57:00.000Z	mnepton	DethKlok	assuming that Linux is going to work like Windows, and support the same feature set, and operate using the same principles, is a flawed assumption.
2006-10-10T06:58:00.000Z	mnepton	DethKlok	seth is right. the best bet is to tell us the task you want to accomplish, and let the Linux community point you to the best solution
2006-10-10T07:01:00.000Z	mnepton	DethKlok	did you install Cacti on the Ubuntu machine? if so, how? did you ensure all the dependencies were met? "Cacti requires MySQL, PHP, RRDTool, net-snmp, and a webserver that supports PHP such as Apache or IIS. Please see the requirements section of the manual for information on how to fulfill these requirements under certain operating systems. Please use the install guide for either Unix or Windows for information about installing Cacti."
2006-10-10T07:01:00.000Z	DethKlok	mnepton	it works fine with the windows boxs
2006-10-10T07:01:00.000Z	mnepton	DethKlok	it may surprise you to learn that Linux is not Windows
2006-10-10T07:02:00.000Z	mnepton	DethKlok	if i bought a box of tampons, inserted them into my urethra, and then went to the doctor and said, "but it *works for my girlfriend!" do you think he'd say, "you're absolutely right. these tamposn are flawed?"
2006-10-10T07:03:00.000Z	DethKlok	mnepton	the hell you talking about,
2006-10-10T07:03:00.000Z	DethKlok	mnepton	cacti is installed, i can view graphs on a windows server, i want to view graphs on a linux server
2006-10-10T07:03:00.000Z	mnepton	DethKlok	i'm talking about the fact that i asked you if you had installed the Linux dependencies for Cacti and your resaponse was, "it works in Windows."
2006-10-10T07:03:00.000Z	DethKlok	mnepton	i just want to know how to get that working
2006-10-10T07:04:00.000Z	mnepton	DethKlok	one last time. MySQL, PHP, RRDTool, net-snmp, and Apache. you installedf all those. on Ubuntu. and configured them.
2006-10-10T07:04:00.000Z	DethKlok	mnepton	Once again sudo apt-get install cacti
2006-10-10T07:05:00.000Z	mnepton	DethKlok	so now go configure the software
2006-10-10T07:05:00.000Z	mnepton	DethKlok	apt-get is not smart enough to edit your config files to set things up exactly how you want them.
2006-10-10T07:05:00.000Z	DethKlok	mnepton	cacti php all that other stuff working but when i go into cacti to setup a device it says my ubuntu box has a SNMP error
2006-10-10T07:06:00.000Z	mnepton	DethKlok	so find that exact error. write it down. go ask Cacti people how that issue is resolved.
2006-10-10T07:06:00.000Z	DethKlok	mnepton	lol its a snmp error
2006-10-10T07:07:00.000Z	mnepton	DethKlok	oh, right. i'm sure Cacti users have never heard of an SNMP error and would be unable to help you resolve SNMP errors with Cacti.
2006-10-10T07:07:00.000Z	mnepton	DethKlok	go talk to Cacti users. they actually use this product.
