2011-12-31T00:24:00.000Z	vouth		Is anyone else seeing enormous amounts of joins/quits?
2011-12-31T00:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vouth	I have them on ignore
2011-12-31T00:25:00.000Z	vouth	ActionParsnip	oCean: weird.
2011-12-31T00:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vouth	most clients can be told to ignore join/part stuff
2012-01-02T06:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vouth	mate is a fork of gnome2, its unofficial
2012-01-02T06:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vouth	mint is also not supported here
2012-01-02T06:32:00.000Z	vouth	ActionParsnip	well when I've got about 20 ppas installed and my cursor runs around the screen like it's scared I figure it's time for an upgrade :-)
2012-01-02T06:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vouth	tried xcfe or lxde?
2012-01-02T06:32:00.000Z	vouth	ActionParsnip	Well, I'm probably going to switch back to plain Ubuntu at some point.
2012-01-02T06:33:00.000Z	vouth	ActionParsnip	I bet Mint has an IRC channel too :-) I did try lxde (in Lubuntu) but I couldn't get compiz working. I have not tried xfce (since I was using Fedora Core 1); maybe that would work well.
2012-01-02T06:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vouth	it does have it's own channel
2012-01-02T06:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vouth	only canonical releases are supported here, none of the spinoff distros are supported here
2012-01-02T06:58:00.000Z	vouth	ActionParsnip	um, I'm not the one asking for support. That's cryptopsy. I was asking why distrowatch bans some distros.
2012-01-05T07:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vouth	install ghex
2012-01-05T07:34:00.000Z	vouth	ActionParsnip	I have ghex2 installed. Running as root, I can only get: "Can not open file!"
2012-01-05T07:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vouth	what file are you opening?
2012-01-05T07:34:00.000Z	vouth	ActionParsnip	In Okteta, I get an empty file.
2012-01-05T07:34:00.000Z	vouth	ActionParsnip	/dev/sda
2012-01-05T07:40:00.000Z	vouth	ActionParsnip	Any idea on the device file thing?
2012-01-05T07:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vouth	not sure there dude, i don't do any hex stuff
2012-01-05T07:41:00.000Z	vouth	ActionParsnip	Oh well. Ok, thanks :-)
