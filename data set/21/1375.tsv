2010-11-13T20:29:00.000Z	paddy_		I am trying to open an encrypted message sent to me in evolution but it will not automaticly open, it comes up as an attachment (.dat fle) but recognises the mime type PGP/MIME-encrypted message-header attachment. How do i get it to automaticly decode the message, I have already added my key ID to the account prefrances.
2010-11-13T20:31:00.000Z	rigved	paddy_	what happens when you click on the email?
2010-11-13T20:33:00.000Z	paddy_	rigved	It tells me there is one attachment
2010-11-13T20:34:00.000Z	rigved	paddy_	download the attachment and then try to decrypt this .dat file
2010-11-13T20:34:00.000Z	rigved	paddy_	also, do you have gpg-agent installed?
2010-11-13T20:36:00.000Z	paddy_	rigved	rigved I have read encrypted mail before with evolution
2010-11-13T20:37:00.000Z	paddy_	rigved	It is installing now, what does it do?
2010-11-13T20:37:00.000Z	rigved	paddy_	have you read encrypted mail before sent from this user? is it possible that the sender took the wrong public key?
2010-11-13T20:37:00.000Z	paddy_	rigved	done
2010-11-13T20:37:00.000Z	rigved	paddy_	it is required to encrypt and decrypt
2010-11-13T20:37:00.000Z	paddy_	rigved	definatly have right key, i checked the id
2010-11-13T20:38:00.000Z	rigved	paddy_	restart evolution and try again
2010-11-13T20:38:00.000Z	paddy_	rigved	still wont work, might it be anything to do with the 'dat' extention
2010-11-13T20:40:00.000Z	rigved	paddy_	i just want to clear one thing - is the entire message encrypted or only the attachment?
2010-11-13T20:40:00.000Z	paddy_	rigved	everthing is encrypted, there is no message being displayed atm
2010-11-13T20:41:00.000Z	rigved	paddy_	so, when you click on the message, does evolution say "Formatting message" and is stuck there?
2010-11-13T20:43:00.000Z	paddy_	rigved	no it just has the attachment list
2010-11-13T20:46:00.000Z	rigved	paddy_	are you able to save the items in the download list? if yes, then you can decrypt these from the terminal...
2010-11-13T20:46:00.000Z	paddy_	rigved	I just decrypted it manualy on the command line but i would still like evolution to be able to do it, as i said it has done it before
2010-11-13T20:47:00.000Z	rigved	paddy_	it can only decrypt emails, not attached items, as far as i know
2010-11-13T21:14:00.000Z	paddy_	rigved	My irc client died, did you reply to me?
