2009-01-29T17:44:00.000Z	remoteCTR1		what was the command to read out the ubuntu version, please?
2009-01-29T17:44:00.000Z	remoteCTR1		!version
2009-01-29T17:45:00.000Z	Slart	remoteCTR1	lsb_release -a | espeak... drop the espeak part if you don't want it read out =)
2009-01-29T17:45:00.000Z	remoteCTR1	Slart	thanx man:)
2009-01-29T17:46:00.000Z	Slart	remoteCTR1	you're welcome
2009-01-29T17:47:00.000Z	Slart	remoteCTR1	that depends on what dependencies that particular package has.. you can force install it but it probably won't work.. the dependencies aren't just there to annoy you (at least I don't think they are)
2009-01-29T17:48:00.000Z	remoteCTR1	Slart	i dont think it has many dependencies... mut maybe i should just dl the package from packages.ubuntu.com and have a try...
2009-01-29T17:49:00.000Z	Slart	remoteCTR1	sure.. if you just double click on it or open it in gdebi it will tell you if the dependencies are met
2009-01-29T17:49:00.000Z	remoteCTR1	Slart	gordonjcp: thanks guys i think i got it from here:)
2009-01-29T17:53:00.000Z	remoteCTR1	Slart	 ok i installed it with dpkg -i (i'm on ssh on one of our servers) and no errors so far, so i guess it worked (dependencies n stuff) right?
2009-01-29T17:54:00.000Z	Slart	remoteCTR1	yup, that's a reasonable assumption
2009-01-29T17:54:00.000Z	remoteCTR1	Slart	hehe thanks, can btw recommen the package, tells you system load and number of logged in users when connecting via ssh
2009-01-29T17:55:00.000Z	Slart	remoteCTR1	noted... in case I ever get more than one user on my server =)
2009-01-29T17:56:00.000Z	remoteCTR1	Slart	hehe well we have two servers for mathematical calculation purposes, really makes sense there:)
2009-01-29T17:56:00.000Z	Slart	remoteCTR1	why not setup something like cactii.. you'll get shiny graphs and a nice webpage.. impresses phb's =)
2009-01-29T17:57:00.000Z	remoteCTR1	Slart	i have read about that one, but i considered to be much too substantial...?
2009-01-29T17:58:00.000Z	Slart	remoteCTR1	well.. you'll need a webserver.. and snmp.. but if you really want to you can put the webserver on another machine and just gather the data
2009-01-29T17:59:00.000Z	remoteCTR1	Slart	well webserver we have, thats not a problem, but as far as i recall that was quite an effort to set up
2009-01-29T18:00:00.000Z	remoteCTR1	Slart	installed it once at home to have a look at it, like a year ago but i guess i squeezed that outa my memory as it bothered me...:D
2009-01-29T18:02:00.000Z	Slart	remoteCTR1	well.. it isn't click and run.. you'll have to do some configuring..but it was just a suggestion.. it's your computers and your time.. you decide what to do with it
2009-01-29T18:15:00.000Z	remoteCTR1	Slart	hehe of course i do and thanks for the suggestion, always appreciate new ideas=)
