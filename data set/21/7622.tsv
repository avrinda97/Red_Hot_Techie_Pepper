2007-05-15T08:12:00.000Z	linux__alien		Which one should i install Ubuntu or Kubuntu?
2007-05-15T08:13:00.000Z	sipior	linux__alien	doesn't really matter, you can install kde later if you like
2007-05-15T08:14:00.000Z	linux__alien	sipior	Can i install kubuntu-Desktop from CD itself later rather than downloading from the internet coz i ve the Kubuntu CD ?
2007-05-15T08:15:00.000Z	sipior	linux__alien	yep, that's right
2007-05-15T08:16:00.000Z	linux__alien	sipior	let me try Ubuntu and check out how it is
2007-05-15T09:29:00.000Z	sipior	linux__alien	you can modify resolv.conf through the dhclient.conf in /etc/dhcp3
2007-05-15T09:29:00.000Z	linux__alien	sipior	i dont want that resolv.conf to be modified how do i stop that from happening
2007-05-15T09:30:00.000Z	sipior	linux__alien	remove "domain-name-servers" from the request stanza
2007-05-15T09:32:00.000Z	linux__alien	sipior	if i remove domain,domain-name-servers and host name will it stop resolv.conf from being modified?
2007-05-15T09:32:00.000Z	sipior	linux__alien	you probably don't want to remove hostname, or domain for that matter
2007-05-15T09:32:00.000Z	sipior	linux__alien	but try it and see how it goes
2007-05-15T09:33:00.000Z	linux__alien	sipior	ok thanks let me try it
2007-05-15T09:49:00.000Z	sipior	linux__alien	modifying that stanza didn't work?
2007-05-15T09:50:00.000Z	linux__alien	sipior	it does not work it still gets modified during startup
2007-05-15T09:51:00.000Z	sipior	linux__alien	what is being placed in the resolv.conf? is it just nameservers, or a search line
2007-05-15T09:51:00.000Z	linux__alien	sipior	it gets updated with 192.168.1.1
2007-05-15T09:52:00.000Z	sipior	linux__alien	is that from your dhcp server? that seems like a strange number....
2007-05-15T09:52:00.000Z	sipior	linux__alien	oh, unless you're running a caching server on your modem or the like
2007-05-15T09:52:00.000Z	linux__alien	sipior	how do i stop it
2007-05-15T09:52:00.000Z	linux__alien	sipior	i used to comment out make_resolv_conf function
2007-05-15T09:53:00.000Z	sipior	linux__alien	which stanza did you comment out domain-name-servers? are you sure it was the right interface?
