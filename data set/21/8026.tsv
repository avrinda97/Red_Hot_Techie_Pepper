2006-10-23T06:01:00.000Z	bruenig	eck0	you have to add that to your sources.list
2006-10-23T06:01:00.000Z	bruenig	eck0	you have to add that to your sources.list
2006-10-23T06:03:00.000Z	bruenig	eck0	open a terminal and do gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list, once in there just paste that line anywhere in it. Save. Then back in the terminal do sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install wine
2006-10-23T06:05:00.000Z	bruenig	eck0	did you do what I said?
2006-10-23T06:09:00.000Z	bruenig	eck0	you added that repo and did "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install wine"?
2006-10-23T06:10:00.000Z	bruenig	eck0	it doesn't matter, doing seperate should do the same thing
2006-10-23T06:10:00.000Z	bruenig	eck0	you are sure you added that repo into /etc/apt/sources.list?
2006-10-23T06:11:00.000Z	bruenig	eck0	pastebin your sources.list
2006-10-23T06:11:00.000Z	bruenig	eck0	you have to delete that #
2006-10-23T06:12:00.000Z	bruenig	eck0	also there should be another line in there that looks like this, deb http://wine.budgetdedicated.com/apt dapper main
2006-10-23T06:18:00.000Z	bruenig	eck0	what are you trying to do?
2006-10-23T06:19:00.000Z	bruenig	eck0	where did you save it when you downloaded it?
2006-10-23T06:20:00.000Z	bruenig	eck0	it probably saves it in your home folder
2006-10-23T06:22:00.000Z	bruenig	eck0	why don't you use a linux gnutella client?
