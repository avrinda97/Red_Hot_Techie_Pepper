2007-05-15T10:07:00.000Z	jorvis_		i just plugged in a usb device and can see from dmesg that it's on 'usb 3-2'.  how can I mount it?
2007-05-15T10:07:00.000Z	Lilacor	jorvis_	what type of USB device?
2007-05-15T10:08:00.000Z	jorvis_	Lilacor	digital camera
2007-05-15T10:09:00.000Z	Lilacor	jorvis_	have you looked any details about how to connect this camera through the web?
2007-05-15T10:10:00.000Z	jorvis_	Lilacor	when I plug it in a dialog comes up and transfers the pictures off the camera easily.  I just can't see how to view it as a drive letter
2007-05-15T10:12:00.000Z	Lilacor	jorvis_	what happens when you plug the camera in and pictures are being transferred off of it...do you see it as a volume on under nautilus?
2007-05-15T10:12:00.000Z	jorvis_	Lilacor	not under the 'Places' tab
2007-05-15T10:14:00.000Z	Lilacor	jorvis_	do you see anything show up under /media when you plug in the device
2007-05-15T10:15:00.000Z	jorvis_	Lilacor	nope
2007-05-15T10:16:00.000Z	Lilacor	jorvis_	so when you're copying files
2007-05-15T10:16:00.000Z	Lilacor	jorvis_	can you see what files are being copied using 'lsof?'
2007-05-15T10:17:00.000Z	jorvis_	Lilacor	lsof | wc -l shows 4300 files ... how would I find it?
2007-05-15T10:17:00.000Z	Lilacor	jorvis_	look for a file that is on the camera only
2007-05-15T10:17:00.000Z	Lilacor	jorvis_	or search for a file format that is only on the camera
2007-05-15T10:23:00.000Z	jorvis_	Lilacor	I kept grepping lsof for 'JPG' while it was transferring pictures and got nothing
2007-05-15T10:23:00.000Z	Lilacor	jorvis_	and the files are all upper-case I take it?
2007-05-15T10:24:00.000Z	jorvis_	Lilacor	yes
2007-05-15T10:26:00.000Z	Lilacor	jorvis_	what does lshw tell you about your camera?
2007-05-15T10:27:00.000Z	jorvis_	Lilacor	thanks for the help ... just had to reboot.  :P
2007-05-15T10:27:00.000Z	Lilacor	jorvis_	because I asked you to use lsof?
2007-05-15T10:28:00.000Z	jorvis_	Lilacor	haha, no.  I have to do something real quick and then i'll boot back and try the lshw
