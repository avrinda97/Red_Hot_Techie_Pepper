2006-08-07T08:00:00.000Z	scrappy_	nathanial	thats the first person shooter?
2006-08-07T08:01:00.000Z	scrappy_	nathanial	i downloaded that last week just do unzip filename.zip and then navigate to the directory it creates and run the .sh file to play the game
2006-08-07T08:02:00.000Z	scrappy_	nathanial	you might see several .sh files if you paste them i can tell you which to use
2006-08-07T08:03:00.000Z	nathanial	scrappy_	so what is the exact process?
2006-08-07T08:03:00.000Z	nathanial	scrappy_	open a terminal and navigate to the file, and then type the file name?
2006-08-07T08:04:00.000Z	scrappy_	nathanial	in terminal use unzip so "unzip filename.zip" this will extract the files to your current directory
2006-08-07T08:04:00.000Z	scrappy_	nathanial	or you can doublecick on the file and use fileroller from inside gnome
2006-08-07T08:05:00.000Z	nathanial	scrappy_	fileroller?
2006-08-07T08:05:00.000Z	nathanial	scrappy_	i'm completely new to ubuntu/linux
2006-08-07T08:05:00.000Z	scrappy_	nathanial	when you doubleclick on the it will ask if you want to open with fileroller think of it like winzip
2006-08-07T08:06:00.000Z	nathanial	scrappy_	thanks for that. When it finishes, I'll let you know.
2006-08-07T08:06:00.000Z	scrappy_	nathanial	you have your video card setup?
2006-08-07T08:06:00.000Z	nathanial	scrappy_	yes
2006-08-07T08:13:00.000Z	nathanial	scrappy_	looksl ike there is only on .sh file.
2006-08-07T08:14:00.000Z	scrappy_	nathanial	yes or from terminal type "sh filename.sh"
2006-08-07T08:14:00.000Z	nathanial	scrappy_	thanks so much.
