2009-06-15T10:06:00.000Z	KayKay		my laptop (dell vostro 1510 supports bluetooth - at least it has an icon in it ) - how do i know if ubuntu linux supports it  ( any special driver needed   ? )
2009-06-15T10:08:00.000Z	tiede	KayKay	do you know for sure your laptop has a bluetooth chipset?
2009-06-15T10:11:00.000Z	tiede	KayKay	!paste
2009-06-15T10:13:00.000Z	tiede	KayKay	you don't have any bluetooth chipset listed there.
2009-06-15T10:13:00.000Z	tiede	KayKay	try lspci and check it out...
2009-06-15T10:13:00.000Z	KayKay	tiede	- That was the output of lspci command..
2009-06-15T10:16:00.000Z	tiede	KayKay	sorry, see previous post
2009-06-15T10:18:00.000Z	KayKay	tiede	, Thanks. I am looking at Amazon here for - Bluetooth USB +edr Adapter Class 2 V2.0
2009-06-15T10:18:00.000Z	tiede	KayKay	good buy!
2009-06-15T10:19:00.000Z	KayKay	tiede	thanks .
2009-06-15T10:19:00.000Z	tiede	KayKay	Yes. Bluetooth is apple's technology, so it
2009-06-15T10:19:00.000Z	tiede	KayKay	Yes. Bluetooth is apple's technology, so it's pretty standard...
2009-06-15T10:28:00.000Z	tiede	KayKay	meaning? like #java that would have java stuff i suppose...
2009-06-15T10:28:00.000Z	tiede	KayKay	can't guarantee you won't be the only one there, though...
2009-06-15T10:29:00.000Z	KayKay	tiede	Thanks. It does not seem active .
2009-06-15T10:29:00.000Z	tiede	KayKay	there are 270 idlers in #java... :(
2009-06-15T10:30:00.000Z	tiede	KayKay	what is your hava question anyways?
2009-06-15T10:30:00.000Z	KayKay	tiede	sunjdk-b14 has been released recently
2009-06-15T10:33:00.000Z	tiede	KayKay	you might have to wait a little while. ubuntu usually follows a change upstream before committing to a new version...
2009-06-15T10:34:00.000Z	tiede	KayKay	if there aren't huge differences, you should be able to do everything smoothly... anyways, the latest linux version of java will always be available at sun.com (remember that they support open source)
2009-06-15T10:35:00.000Z	KayKay	tiede	Thanks . That is what I thought.   Is there a page more about volunteering information for the packaging .  ( As far as the feature in b14 that I am interested is - G1 garbage collector )
