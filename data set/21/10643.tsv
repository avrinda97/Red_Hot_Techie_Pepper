2005-04-26T11:57:00.000Z	benh		yes, it does
2005-04-26T11:57:00.000Z	benh		well, can I run ubuntu install ramdisk from a home made kernel ?
2005-04-26T11:57:00.000Z	benh		or its like newer debian where they absolutely need the isntaller in sync with the install kernel ?
2005-04-26T11:58:00.000Z	benh		I don't care much, I'll run my kernels on it anyways
2005-04-26T11:58:00.000Z	benh		It used to be so easy in the past with woody installer
2005-04-26T11:58:00.000Z	benh		I could use it with any kernel
2005-04-26T11:58:00.000Z	benh		the whole debian installer thing is a fiasco imho
2005-04-26T12:00:00.000Z	benh		well, I don't know ubuntu at all :)
2005-04-26T12:01:00.000Z	benh		yah, which sucks :)
2005-04-26T12:01:00.000Z	benh		ok, if it doesn't work, I'll try genpoo :)
2005-04-26T12:02:00.000Z	darmou	benh	do know of a good flash replacment on ppc?
2005-04-26T12:02:00.000Z	darmou	benh	is a legend:)
2005-04-26T12:02:00.000Z	benh	darmou	nope :(
2005-04-26T12:03:00.000Z	benh	darmou	I have some hopes we might get macromedia to do something one day ...
2005-04-26T12:03:00.000Z	benh	darmou	but don't hold your breath
2005-04-26T12:03:00.000Z	darmou	benh	gplflash is quite good, only problem is that it crashes firefox.  swfflash does not work
2005-04-26T12:05:00.000Z	darmou	benh	are ppc people going to keep using bitkeeper?
2005-04-26T12:06:00.000Z	benh	darmou	we haven't really used it seriously for ages
2005-04-26T12:07:00.000Z	benh	darmou	so no
2005-04-26T12:07:00.000Z	darmou	benh	so how is the ppc kernel maintained?
2005-04-26T12:09:00.000Z	benh	darmou	not exactly ... we did beta test it, but it's not what caused linus to use it
