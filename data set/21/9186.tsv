2005-11-07T11:53:00.000Z	raphink		it links to directories that don't exist on my conf
2005-11-07T11:54:00.000Z	raphink		sure I have /var/www bur[n] er

2005-11-07T11:54:00.000Z	raphink		it's only php that doesn't work

2005-11-07T11:54:00.000Z	paulproteus	raphink	a2enmod php4, iirc
2005-11-07T11:55:00.000Z	paulproteus	raphink	http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/207
2005-11-07T11:56:00.000Z	paulproteus	raphink	You may want to read the Apache2 config setup info at http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/101
2005-11-07T12:17:00.000Z	paulproteus	raphink	Still working on PHP?
2005-11-07T12:18:00.000Z	raphink	paulproteus	I've found something interesting just now
2005-11-07T12:18:00.000Z	paulproteus	raphink	You *must* read the debian-administration URLs I presented you.
2005-11-07T12:18:00.000Z	paulproteus	raphink	Furthermore, I believe that simply "a2enmod php4" will be adequate.
2005-11-07T12:19:00.000Z	paulproteus	raphink	But if you've followed non-Debian or non-Ubuntu instructions, then all bets are off.
2005-11-07T12:19:00.000Z	paulproteus	raphink	Again, *please* read the d-a.org links...
2005-11-07T12:21:00.000Z	raphink	paulproteus	shouldn't php4 be activated when it's installed by default?
2005-11-07T12:24:00.000Z	paulproteus	raphink	Guess not. ;)
