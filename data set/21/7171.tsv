2009-06-16T20:19:00.000Z	ethan_space		hello..need some unable to boot windows after installing ubuntu 9.04
2009-06-16T20:20:00.000Z	Slart	ethan_space	do you get an error message?
2009-06-17T13:17:00.000Z	Slart	ethan_space	installing ubuntu after windows doesn't usually render windows unbootable
2009-06-17T13:17:00.000Z	Slart	ethan_space	it's supposed to just give you a grub menu choice for booting windows
2009-06-17T13:18:00.000Z	Slart	ethan_space	is there a number in the error?
2009-06-17T13:19:00.000Z	Slart	ethan_space	ok
2009-06-17T13:23:00.000Z	Slart	ethan_space	ok.. let me check what error 17 means.. hang on
2009-06-17T13:25:00.000Z	Slart	ethan_space	hmm.. can you pastebin your /boot/grub/menu.lst ?
2009-06-17T13:29:00.000Z	Slart	ethan_space	where is your windows install located? which hard drive? partition?
2009-06-17T13:31:00.000Z	Slart	ethan_space	ok.. try opening that file you pastebinned.. "gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst" and remove the two lines starting with "map"
2009-06-17T13:32:00.000Z	Slart	ethan_space	then save it.. and try rebooting
2009-06-17T13:34:00.000Z	Slart	ethan_space	well.. the easiest way is to run gparted
2009-06-17T13:34:00.000Z	Slart	ethan_space	and look at the different partitions.. to see what /dev/sd? name they have
2009-06-17T13:45:00.000Z	Slart	ethan_space	hmm.. and you're not using some kind of BIOS boot menu thing?
2009-06-17T14:04:00.000Z	Slart	ethan_space	no worries..
2009-06-17T14:05:00.000Z	Slart	ethan_space	so, still the same error.. odd
2009-06-17T14:09:00.000Z	Slart	ethan_space	I don't know really.. you shouldn't have to reinstall windows.. but I can't really think of a reason for it not to work
2009-06-17T14:12:00.000Z	Slart	ethan_space	it needs the external drive connected.. that's where the boot files are..
2009-06-17T14:13:00.000Z	Slart	ethan_space	just thought of something.. try running this in a terminal "sudo update-grub" .. then reboot again
2009-06-17T14:40:00.000Z	Slart	ethan_space	ah.. it was the sudo update-grub thing?
2009-06-17T14:40:00.000Z	Slart	ethan_space	sweet.. I'll have to remember that
