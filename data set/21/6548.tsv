2007-04-30T12:03:00.000Z	kenthomson	fbarcenas	fesity
2007-04-30T12:04:00.000Z	kenthomson	fbarcenas	propriety drivers?
2007-04-30T12:04:00.000Z	fbarcenas	kenthomson	I have feisty..
2007-04-30T12:05:00.000Z	fbarcenas	kenthomson	no proprietary drivers. just one integrated broadcom 4313.
2007-04-30T12:05:00.000Z	kenthomson	fbarcenas	you remember which package you installed to get the wireless working?
2007-04-30T12:06:00.000Z	fbarcenas	kenthomson	none, fiesty prompted me to download th efirmware and set it up automatically.
2007-04-30T12:07:00.000Z	kenthomson	fbarcenas	Try System>Administration>Restricted Manager, is anything listed there?
2007-04-30T12:08:00.000Z	fbarcenas	kenthomson	nope, supposedly it's not integrated into ubuntu. No restricted drivers necessary.
2007-04-30T12:08:00.000Z	fbarcenas	kenthomson	nope, supposedly it's noW integrated into ubuntu. No restricted drivers necessary.
2007-04-30T12:10:00.000Z	fbarcenas	kenthomson	is it as easy as rebooting with it disabled in the bios, rinse wash and repeat?
2007-04-30T12:10:00.000Z	fbarcenas	kenthomson	I think if I do that it will just reuse the previous config.
2007-04-30T12:10:00.000Z	kenthomson	fbarcenas	try searching in synaptic with the term "wireless" in Description, than sort the packages by the first field (installed-not installed, the green thing) and look at all the installed packages, maybe you shall find your wireless driver package there, then right-click and complete removal, select OK, and reboot
2007-04-30T12:11:00.000Z	fbarcenas	kenthomson	ok.. cool, I'll try that!
2007-04-30T12:13:00.000Z	fbarcenas	kenthomson	 you do realize that rebooting will disconnect me from IRC, right? :-p
2007-04-30T12:13:00.000Z	kenthomson	fbarcenas	is that so?
2007-04-30T12:30:00.000Z	fbarcenas	kenthomson	it still doesn't work... Any ideas?
2007-04-30T12:30:00.000Z	kenthomson	fbarcenas	none whatsoever, i was shooting in the dark
2007-04-30T12:30:00.000Z	fbarcenas	kenthomson	damn.. I heard people die that way. :-)
2007-04-30T12:31:00.000Z	kenthomson	fbarcenas	they surely do but WHY THE HELL are they standing in the dark?
2007-04-30T12:31:00.000Z	fbarcenas	kenthomson	maybe light is to overrated?
