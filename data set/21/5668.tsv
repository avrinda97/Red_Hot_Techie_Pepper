2007-09-02T05:30:00.000Z	slight	DeZ_666	: hi
2007-09-02T05:31:00.000Z	DeZ_666	slight	you need disklabel, i think
2007-09-02T05:31:00.000Z	DeZ_666		or if the info doesnt matter, use gparted and reformat it?
2007-09-02T05:32:00.000Z	slight	DeZ_666	it's my boot partition :)
2007-09-02T05:32:00.000Z	DeZ_666		Oh my.
2007-09-02T05:32:00.000Z	slight	DeZ_666	i do have the data so could reformat it, but i'd rather do a non-destructive fix if possible
2007-09-02T05:32:00.000Z	DeZ_666		:)
2007-09-02T05:32:00.000Z	DeZ_666		disklabel?
2007-09-02T05:32:00.000Z	DeZ_666		you need to change the partition code, type, whatever its called
2007-09-02T05:33:00.000Z	slight	DeZ_666	it is actually working, grub just ignores the fact its labelled as fat32, but then its not mounted afterwards so updates will be a problem
2007-09-02T05:33:00.000Z	slight	DeZ_666	yeah i'm just not sure how tto change it. parted doesn't seem to support doing that
