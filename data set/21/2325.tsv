2012-04-29T13:52:00.000Z	greenbrother		can anyone help me with audio problem?
2012-04-29T13:53:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	greenbrother	please describe you audio problem in detail, but don't use Enter as punctuation ;-)
2012-04-29T13:53:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	greenbrother	describe you => describe your
2012-04-29T13:56:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	greenbrother	try shutting down unneccesary channels that might be a source of crosstalk or distortion. On cheap soundchips, the microphone channel is usually not that separated from the rest. That may be your primary suspect.
2012-04-29T14:00:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	greenbrother	if you are only listening to audio and not recording in the mean while, your line-in and microphone channels can be shut down without negative consequences. That might even solve the pops you are hearing.
2012-04-29T14:01:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	greenbrother	unless you are connecting to XMBL through line-in of course.
2012-04-29T14:02:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	greenbrother	you can toggle mute on any unneeded channels through alsamixer, using [M] when you have selected that channel. Just be sure to re-enable them when you need them
2012-04-29T14:04:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	greenbrother	try this: kill pulseaudio
2012-04-29T14:04:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	greenbrother	try this: pkill pulseaudio
2012-04-29T14:04:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	greenbrother	yes, in the terminal.
2012-04-29T14:05:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	greenbrother	pulseaudio should restart automatically, but this might give you a window without the pops and crackles.
2012-04-29T14:06:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	greenbrother	what sound chip do you use? "lspci | grep audio"
2012-04-29T14:08:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	greenbrother	yes, but that box probably contains a standard sound chip, do you get the same description through lspci?
2012-04-29T14:09:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	greenbrother	lspci | grep -i audio
2012-04-29T14:12:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	greenbrother	yuck the site requires flash :-/
2012-04-29T14:14:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	greenbrother	try using another USB port and if you are not using one already, use a USB cable with a Ferrite core surrounding the cable to minimize interference.
2012-04-29T14:16:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	greenbrother	if the speech and the rest of the audio are on different channels, you can adjust the channels accordingly.
2012-04-29T14:17:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	greenbrother	did you cehck the level of compatibilty of you device on  the linux hardware compatibility list?
2012-04-29T14:18:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	greenbrother	if the problem is intermittent, the notifier sounds from the desktop might cause the interference.
2012-04-29T14:19:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	greenbrother	....groan... no I mean the level of linux compatibility of your Presonus USB sound"card".
