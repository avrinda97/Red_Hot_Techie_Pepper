2012-08-27T18:42:00.000Z	Alpha-Omega		I just accidently added a master boot record to a hard drive that only had files on it, it was for storage, now when I do sudo fdisk -l, it doesn't show up, did I destroy it or something?
2012-08-27T18:42:00.000Z	Alpha-Omega		the ubuntu install asked me to add to the hard drive and it ended up adding the master boot record to my hard drive that had only files on it
2012-08-27T18:43:00.000Z	Alpha-Omega		I knew I should've unpligged it :(
2012-08-27T18:44:00.000Z	Alpha-Omega		it's not showing up in testdisk
2012-08-27T18:45:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	Alpha-Omega	you can fix mbr with testdisk
2012-08-27T18:45:00.000Z	Alpha-Omega	lotuspsychje	but if the drive isn't showing up in testdisk
2012-08-27T18:46:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	Alpha-Omega	thats odd indeed, is it ntfs?
2012-08-27T18:46:00.000Z	Alpha-Omega	lotuspsychje	yes it is
2012-08-27T18:46:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	Alpha-Omega	you installed ntfs-3g?
2012-08-27T18:47:00.000Z	Alpha-Omega	lotuspsychje	that might just do it :P
2012-08-27T18:47:00.000Z	Alpha-Omega	lotuspsychje	it says ntfs-3g is the newest
2012-08-27T18:48:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	Alpha-Omega	try ntfs from software centre
2012-08-27T18:49:00.000Z	Alpha-Omega	lotuspsychje	so fdisk wouldn't recognize it if I don't have this installed? let me try it
2012-08-27T18:49:00.000Z	Alpha-Omega	lotuspsychje	I'm on kde, there's nothing called ntfs in muon
2012-08-27T18:51:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	Alpha-Omega	enable auto boot for ntfs and try a reboot
2012-08-27T18:57:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	Alpha-Omega	pastebin your etc/fstab in channel mate, so we can take a look
2012-08-27T18:58:00.000Z	Alpha-Omega	lotuspsychje	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1169982/
2012-08-27T19:00:00.000Z	Alpha-Omega	lotuspsychje	it's a drive with just files on it
2012-08-27T19:01:00.000Z	Alpha-Omega	lotuspsychje	nope, the other two partitions are my windows partition for windows install
2012-08-27T19:01:00.000Z	Alpha-Omega	lotuspsychje	haven't even heard of it
2012-08-27T19:10:00.000Z	Alpha-Omega	lotuspsychje	would you happen to know whether I need to do anything now to remove the mbr on the drive with the files or anything I need to do?
