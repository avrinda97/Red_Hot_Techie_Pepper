2011-04-29T06:26:00.000Z	soreau		Why doesn't Alt+F2 work when metacity is running?
2011-04-29T06:27:00.000Z	soreau		Why doesn't Alt+F2 work with metacity in 11.04?
2011-04-29T06:27:00.000Z	robin0800	soreau	if metacity is running unity 3d has crashed as it needs compiz
2011-04-29T06:28:00.000Z	soreau	robin0800	That was not my question
2011-04-29T06:28:00.000Z	robin0800	soreau	it does
2011-04-29T06:28:00.000Z	soreau	robin0800	Why didn't you say that in the first place?
2011-04-29T06:31:00.000Z	robin0800	soreau	unity 2d works fine
2011-07-05T02:28:00.000Z	robin0800	soreau	don't think there is a show desktop app in unity
2011-07-05T02:30:00.000Z	robin0800	soreau	classic uses metacity not compiz
2011-07-05T02:30:00.000Z	soreau	robin0800	You can run compiz in classic
2011-07-05T02:34:00.000Z	robin0800	soreau	I take it you don't like unity?
2011-07-05T02:34:00.000Z	soreau	robin0800	What does that have to do with ubuntu?
2011-07-05T02:35:00.000Z	robin0800	soreau	its the default in ubuntu 11.04
2011-07-05T02:35:00.000Z	soreau	robin0800	Yes but my opinion is irrelevant
2011-10-21T03:04:00.000Z	soreau	robin0800	How do you get configurable panels? When I installed gnome-panel on 11.10 live session, I couldn't even right click on it
2011-10-21T03:06:00.000Z	robin0800	soreau	you use alt click or super + alt if you have compiz running thou that needs a hack to work
2011-10-21T03:07:00.000Z	soreau	robin0800	To right click on gnome-panel?
2011-10-21T03:07:00.000Z	soreau	robin0800	So try alt+left click
2011-10-21T03:08:00.000Z	robin0800	soreau	no the hack is to get compiz working
2011-10-21T03:08:00.000Z	soreau	robin0800	I know how to get compiz running, I just couldn't configure gnome-panel in gnome3
2011-10-21T03:11:00.000Z	soreau	robin0800	I don't care about that. I *already know* how to use compiz. I just couldn't configure gnome-panel in gnome3
