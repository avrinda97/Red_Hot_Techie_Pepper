2005-01-30T06:42:00.000Z	arabflak		Hmz, I guess I'm talking to thin air :P
2005-01-30T06:42:00.000Z	arabflak		I've been through Suse, Debian and Gentoo.
2005-01-30T06:42:00.000Z	arabflak		Only Suse worked.
2005-01-30T06:43:00.000Z	arabflak		Now I'm in Ubuntu :)
2005-01-30T06:43:00.000Z	knghtbrd	arabflak	the 5600 should work with the NV drivers?
2005-01-30T06:43:00.000Z	arabflak		Yay :)
2005-01-30T06:43:00.000Z	arabflak		Yeah, knghtbrd, but I can't seem to install the drivers.
2005-01-30T06:43:00.000Z	knghtbrd		oh, do you have .. I don't think it's still called NV_driver ... loaded?
2005-01-30T06:44:00.000Z	arabflak		I've activated my root account, killed GDM, sh'd the .run from Nvidia, it said it couldn't match my kernel and if I wanted to try and find better ones at download.nvidia.com.
2005-01-30T06:44:00.000Z	knghtbrd		crap, the kernel module, whatever it was  =D
2005-01-30T06:44:00.000Z	arabflak		It couldn't find any, so if I wanted to compile right ones.
2005-01-30T06:44:00.000Z	arabflak		I couldn't because I didn't have a CC compiler.
2005-01-30T06:44:00.000Z	knghtbrd		oh, Ubuntu has their own package for NV drivers
2005-01-30T06:44:00.000Z	arabflak		And how do I get those? (install those :P)
2005-01-30T06:45:00.000Z	knghtbrd		knghtbrd@yumi:~$ ssh 192.168.0.6 # ubuntu zeroconf please!  =D
2005-01-30T06:46:00.000Z	arabflak		No, scizzo, yours is kind of perfect :)
2005-01-30T06:46:00.000Z	arabflak		And that also enables the hardware accelerated OpenGL and such?
2005-01-30T06:47:00.000Z	arabflak		(i need that stuff to run my Blender)
2005-01-30T06:48:00.000Z	knghtbrd	arabflak	nvidia-kernel-common and either nvidia-kernel-source or the binary package for your drivers
2005-01-30T06:52:00.000Z	knghtbrd	arabflak	you making sense of it?
2005-01-30T06:53:00.000Z	arabflak	knghtbrd	to be honest, no.
