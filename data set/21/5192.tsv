2009-07-18T01:27:00.000Z	MrPiracy	sebsebseb	shouldn't the swap area be the same as the physical RAM memory?
2009-07-18T01:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MrPiracy	not with large amounts of RAM
2009-07-18T01:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MrPiracy	if you have 512MB RAM,  you  do 1GB SWAP
2009-07-18T01:28:00.000Z	MrPiracy	sebsebseb	i have 8gb of ram here and created a 8gb swap, did i do wrong?
2009-07-18T01:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MrPiracy	if you have 1GB RAM, you can do 2GB SWAP, if you have  4GB RAM you can do  8GB  SWAP, altough not needed  with 4GB RAM really.   in fact personally I have no use for SWAP  with only 1GB RAM :)
2009-07-18T01:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MrPiracy	8GB RAM and 8GB SWAP should be ok
2009-07-18T01:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MrPiracy	however you only need  SWAP space if your going to hibernate
2009-07-18T01:29:00.000Z	MrPiracy	sebsebseb	ohhh, then i can just delete it?
2009-07-18T01:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MrPiracy	yep
2009-07-18T01:30:00.000Z	MrPiracy	sebsebseb	cool, hehe
2009-07-18T01:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MrPiracy	and I think it maybe also gets useed for suspend/sleep
2009-07-18T01:30:00.000Z	MrPiracy	sebsebseb	i dont use these features
2009-07-18T01:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MrPiracy	SWAP is  really for  computers with not that much RAM
2009-07-18T01:31:00.000Z	MrPiracy	sebsebseb	heheheh, old habits ... i'll just delete it, i believe 8gb is enough for jaunty
2009-07-18T01:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MrPiracy	8GB RAM is  more than enough for jaunty
2009-07-18T01:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MrPiracy	you can probably run quite a few virtual machines   inside  Ubuntu with that as well
2009-07-18T01:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MrPiracy	in fact I wonder how many
2009-07-18T01:32:00.000Z	MrPiracy	sebsebseb	my processor is kinda old, it doesnt have virtualization
2009-07-18T01:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MrPiracy	mine either and we don't need hardware virtualization
2009-07-18T01:32:00.000Z	MrPiracy	sebsebseb	core2duo 1.7  ... one of the first models
2009-07-18T06:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MrPiracy	def
