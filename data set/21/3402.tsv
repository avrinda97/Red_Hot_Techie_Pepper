2009-08-20T08:55:00.000Z	MOUD		Hey all
2009-08-20T08:56:00.000Z	MOUD		The network thing that appears next to the clock disappeared and so is the program for it that is on the System > Preferences...  How can I make it come back?
2009-08-20T08:57:00.000Z	sp_	MOUD	try nm-applet in a console ?
2009-08-20T08:58:00.000Z	MOUD	sp_	I'm not on ubuntu
2009-08-20T08:58:00.000Z	sp_	MOUD	you're on #ubuntu
2009-08-20T08:58:00.000Z	MOUD	sp_	I mean that I'm not running ubuntu atm
2009-08-20T08:58:00.000Z	sp_	MOUD	I see, what are you running then?
2009-08-20T08:59:00.000Z	MOUD	sp_	Win XP (dual boot)
2009-08-20T09:00:00.000Z	sp_	MOUD	can you see the wireless card in the windows network center?
2009-08-20T09:00:00.000Z	MOUD	sp_	both my Ethernet and Wireless were working fine a few minutes ago but they disappeared without a trace
2009-08-20T09:01:00.000Z	sp_	MOUD	do your interfaces appear in the device manager?
2009-08-20T09:02:00.000Z	sp_	MOUD	System -> Hardware -> Device Manager, IIRC
2009-08-20T09:03:00.000Z	MOUD	sp_	yes. I think they disappeared after I installed arping, not sure though
2009-08-20T09:03:00.000Z	MOUD	sp_	also tried recovery mode and no change
2009-08-20T09:07:00.000Z	sp_	MOUD	so, in ubuntu you see the interfaces?
2009-08-20T09:08:00.000Z	MOUD	sp_	used to, some minutes ago
2009-08-20T09:08:00.000Z	sp_	MOUD	sorry, maybe you should check /etc/network/interfaces and see if everything is all right there
2009-08-20T09:09:00.000Z	sp_	MOUD	you should (maybe) have a interfaces.backup file you can use if everything is screwed up
2009-08-20T09:10:00.000Z	MOUD	sp_	I'll take a look later, thanks for the help
2009-08-20T09:11:00.000Z	sp_	MOUD	sorry I couldn't be more helpful, I'm still green beans :P
2009-08-20T09:13:00.000Z	sp_	MOUD	good luck
