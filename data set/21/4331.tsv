2008-05-31T19:31:00.000Z	legend2440	PPKuma	uuid looks wrong type sudo blkid in terminal and compare
2008-05-31T19:42:00.000Z	legend2440	PPKuma	Steve-Cal why would fdisk say sda8 is W95 FAT32 and blkid says its ext3?
2008-05-31T19:43:00.000Z	PPKuma	legend2440	i think is because i reformated the partition reently from fat32 to ext3
2008-05-31T19:44:00.000Z	legend2440	PPKuma	what does partition editor say it is?
2008-05-31T19:44:00.000Z	legend2440	PPKuma	what does partition editor say it is? vfat or ext3?
2008-05-31T19:44:00.000Z	PPKuma	legend2440	partition editor?
2008-05-31T19:44:00.000Z	legend2440	PPKuma	system>admin>partition editor
2008-05-31T19:44:00.000Z	PPKuma	legend2440	what's the partition editor? fstab?
2008-05-31T19:46:00.000Z	PPKuma	legend2440	i cant find the partition editor =/
2008-05-31T19:46:00.000Z	legend2440	PPKuma	sudo apt-get install gparted
2008-05-31T19:47:00.000Z	PPKuma	legend2440	i have installed QtParted, is it okay?
2008-05-31T19:47:00.000Z	legend2440	PPKuma	sure what does that say ?
2008-05-31T19:49:00.000Z	PPKuma	legend2440	it say ext3
2008-05-31T19:50:00.000Z	legend2440	PPKuma	then do as Steve-Cal said and change to ext3 and change uuid so it matches blkid
2008-05-31T19:50:00.000Z	PPKuma	legend2440	done
2008-05-31T19:51:00.000Z	PPKuma	legend2440	then i'll wait to my last boot :)
2008-05-31T19:51:00.000Z	PPKuma	legend2440	Steve-Cal, stueng, thanks a lot for your time and patience
2008-06-10T19:04:00.000Z	legend2440	PPKuma	if you install    nautilus-open-terminal   and reboot it adds a context menu so when you right click you have option   Open Terminal  from any folder. eliminates need for cd to folder and you can click it twice and have two instances of terminal open
2008-06-10T19:05:00.000Z	PPKuma	legend2440	that's rich, should i install it with apt-get?
2008-06-10T19:06:00.000Z	legend2440	PPKuma	sudo apt-get install nautilus-open-terminal
