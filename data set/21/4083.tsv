2008-07-17T14:11:00.000Z	cckk		if it counts theres no 64 bit flash for windows either shitty..
2008-07-17T14:12:00.000Z	cckk		anyone else have any ideas for my folder with icon problem or the ati hd 650 usb driver problem?
2008-07-17T14:13:00.000Z	Slart	cckk	I might not have been paying attention when you described the problem.. would you mind doing it again?
2008-07-17T14:14:00.000Z	cckk	Slart	 sure which problem tv tuner or folder problem?
2008-07-17T14:14:00.000Z	Slart	cckk	ngghh.. tv tuners give me the creeps.. I'll go with folder problems for 200, please
2008-07-17T14:15:00.000Z	cckk	Slart	lol, for 200 how do i make my file folder show a thumnail inside eg. i have a movie it has a cover its stored in a folder under videos called hero, can that folder show the picture of hero as it does in windows?
2008-07-17T14:48:00.000Z	Slart	cckk	ok.. I've googled, searched menus, looked in gconf.. nothing useful about background images.. I can't even change the default background with that tool in the menus.. I'm most disappointed
2008-07-17T14:49:00.000Z	cckk	Slart	backround do you mean folder icans?
2008-07-17T14:49:00.000Z	Slart	cckk	background images for folders in nautilus
2008-07-17T14:49:00.000Z	Slart	cckk	not icons
2008-07-17T14:51:00.000Z	Slart	cckk	nautilus is the file explorer in gnome/ubuntu
2008-07-17T14:51:00.000Z	Slart	cckk	gnome doesn't do file browsing =)
2008-07-17T14:52:00.000Z	Slart	cckk	that little program seemed useful.. but it's kind of bad that this feature isn't in there already
2008-07-17T14:54:00.000Z	Slart	cckk	well.. there's brainstorm.. or launchpad..
2008-07-17T14:56:00.000Z	Slart	cckk	I don't think it will kill your computer.. I don't know if it works
2008-07-17T14:56:00.000Z	Slart	cckk	give it a try..
2008-07-17T15:07:00.000Z	Slart	cckk	nope.. only one instance of installing stuff at a time
2008-07-17T15:07:00.000Z	Slart	cckk	it will just give you an error if you try
2008-07-17T15:09:00.000Z	Slart	cckk	I'll probably still be here
2008-07-17T16:52:00.000Z	cckk	Slart	light: hows it going im home now
2008-07-17T16:53:00.000Z	Slart	cckk	hello again
