2012-06-16T22:49:00.000Z	newtoubuntu	bazhang	so it will be printed to pdf
2012-06-16T22:50:00.000Z	bazhang	newtoubuntu	print to pdf yes
2012-06-16T22:50:00.000Z	newtoubuntu	bazhang	let me try
2012-06-16T22:56:00.000Z	bazhang	newtoubuntu	such as pdfedit?
2012-06-16T22:58:00.000Z	bazhang	newtoubuntu	its in the repos. always look there first
2012-06-16T22:58:00.000Z	bazhang	newtoubuntu	sudo apt-get install pdfedit
2012-06-16T22:59:00.000Z	bazhang	newtoubuntu	yes
2012-06-16T23:02:00.000Z	bazhang	newtoubuntu	yes, you can only have a single instance of apt running at a time
2012-06-16T23:21:00.000Z	bazhang	newtoubuntu	install gufw if you wish a gui for ufw
2012-06-17T12:08:00.000Z	bazhang	newtoubuntu	got gufw installed as I suggested?
2012-06-17T12:09:00.000Z	newtoubuntu	bazhang	yes but didn't really help... so i just did sudo ufw enable and sudo ufw default deny
2012-06-17T12:10:00.000Z	newtoubuntu	bazhang	but the outgoing connections - no control
2012-06-17T12:10:00.000Z	bazhang	newtoubuntu	why do you mention firewall and hibernate together
2012-06-17T12:13:00.000Z	bazhang	newtoubuntu	you wish to shape the user bandwidth? is that what you mean by outgoing? please clarify exactly what you are talking about
2012-06-17T12:13:00.000Z	newtoubuntu	bazhang	brontosaurusrex as good as ubuntu is, i'd like some control over what programs connect to the internet
2012-06-17T12:14:00.000Z	bazhang	newtoubuntu	such as what
2012-06-17T12:17:00.000Z	newtoubuntu	bazhang	no connections by any program to the internet without explicit "allow"
2012-06-17T12:19:00.000Z	newtoubuntu	bazhang	have you used zonealarm
