2009-05-15T05:15:00.000Z	Enissay		How can i list the content of "/" with size?
2009-05-15T05:16:00.000Z	smerz	Enissay	via GUI or commandline?
2009-05-15T05:17:00.000Z	Enissay	smerz	commandline
2009-05-15T05:24:00.000Z	Enissay	smerz	5130    ./var  => what do that mean?
2009-05-15T05:24:00.000Z	smerz	Enissay	/var is 5130 megabytes large if you used my command
2009-05-15T05:24:00.000Z	smerz	Enissay	around 5 GB
2009-05-15T05:25:00.000Z	smerz	Enissay	my /var is 700 mb
2009-05-15T05:27:00.000Z	smerz	Enissay	there you go :D
2009-05-15T05:30:00.000Z	Enissay	smerz	i found some files there of 1.1GB xD
2009-05-15T05:30:00.000Z	Enissay	smerz	your command gives folder only
2009-05-15T05:30:00.000Z	smerz	Enissay	possible yeah
2009-05-15T05:32:00.000Z	Enissay	smerz	I have 2 files of 1.1GB each: syslog, kern.log   ....  what are they?
2009-05-15T05:33:00.000Z	smerz	Enissay	system log and kernel log, normally these are only kept for 1 week. so they should not grow to 1.1GB
2009-05-15T05:41:00.000Z	smerz	Enissay	if you have logs cycling enabled. so you got messages, messages.0, messages.1 ... messages.6 and your logs are still 1.1GB on those first files you may wanna have a look in these logs as to why they are so big
2009-05-15T05:47:00.000Z	Enissay	smerz	everything freeze when trying to open it xD.... how to disable what you called "log cycling"?
2009-05-15T05:47:00.000Z	smerz	Enissay	log cycling is something you want. for the moment you can just delete the biggest files (or all of em)
2009-05-15T05:48:00.000Z	smerz	Enissay	but i suggest reading the logs once they build up again. could be some issue with your system
2009-05-15T05:48:00.000Z	Enissay	smerz	is it safe?
2009-05-15T05:49:00.000Z	smerz	Enissay	/var/log yes
2009-05-15T05:49:00.000Z	smerz	Enissay	but theres a chance that something is going wrong continuously, thats why you should have a look into the newly written logs
2009-05-15T05:50:00.000Z	smerz	Enissay	i'm thinking disk failures etc
