2005-09-28T15:09:00.000Z	tristanmike	cyphase	I appreciate the advice, but I am happy with firefox for now, I don't want to go doing and using things I'm not comfortable with yet, I'm still a Linux baby
2005-09-28T15:10:00.000Z	cyphase	tristanmike	i don't mean switch
2005-09-28T15:10:00.000Z	cyphase	tristanmike	posting in #flood now..
2005-09-28T15:10:00.000Z	tristanmike	cyphase	right, sorry, didn't mean anything, i just meant if I don't know how to install firefox, I won't know how to install ephipany or whatever
2005-09-28T15:16:00.000Z	cyphase	tristanmike	then you have a special case i think

2005-09-29T11:39:00.000Z	cyphase	tristanmike	unfourtanetly, probably not
2005-09-29T11:39:00.000Z	tristanmike	cyphase	cool, thanx
2005-09-29T11:40:00.000Z	cyphase	tristanmike	or what WebLOCH said :)
2005-09-29T11:57:00.000Z	tristanmike	cyphase	I kinda figure it out, I have a lot of keys working now, like "My Documents" opens my home folder
2005-09-29T11:58:00.000Z	cyphase	tristanmike	cool
2005-09-29T11:58:00.000Z	tristanmike	cyphase	I did it via the "Keyboard Shortcuts" option but there are a few that I can't set in there, how would I set them to other programs?
2005-09-29T11:58:00.000Z	cyphase	tristanmike	no idea
2005-09-29T11:59:00.000Z	tristanmike	cyphase	ok, thanks

2006-03-15T12:25:00.000Z	tristanmike	cyphase	they would have to pay a fee
2006-03-15T12:26:00.000Z	tristanmike	cyphase	if you are in a country that abides by copywrites then yes, it is illegal if you haven't payed for the codec
