2012-04-29T04:08:00.000Z	john38	escott	how do i enable login sound
2012-04-29T04:16:00.000Z	john38	escott	im no sure how to enable login sound in gnome-session-properties
2012-04-29T04:18:00.000Z	escott	john38	with 11.10 they started hiding the option. there is a file you can edit somewhere to make it appear in the session properties.
2012-04-29T04:18:00.000Z	john38	escott	which one

2012-05-03T04:37:00.000Z	john38	escott	thats that disable sound..but i tried that webpage already it didnt work
2012-05-03T04:37:00.000Z	escott	john38	didnt work in what way
2012-05-03T04:38:00.000Z	john38	escott	i edited that file then went to startup applications it was checked already i unchecked it but still no sound when entering desktop
2012-05-03T04:39:00.000Z	escott	john38	well checked means it would play the sound
2012-05-03T04:40:00.000Z	john38	escott	should i leave the file at True instead of False
2012-05-03T04:41:00.000Z	escott	john38	if it is unchecked it is definitely not going to play. you can check the file that you edited and try to figure out what sound file it is supposed to play
2012-05-03T04:41:00.000Z	john38	escott	ok
2012-05-03T04:43:00.000Z	john38	escott	im not very good at conf files ...should i change...NoDisplay=false to True
2012-05-03T04:44:00.000Z	john38	escott	and X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=false to True
2012-05-03T04:44:00.000Z	escott	john38	no the nodisplay thing is to make it not show up in gnome-session-properties. but that file should list a sound it is supposed to play
