2006-12-07T11:47:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Bakefy	same way as any version
2006-12-07T11:47:00.000Z	Bakefy	nolimitsoya	I thought that you added them in the synaptic package manager
2006-12-07T11:48:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Bakefy	you could, but i dont wuite see the point...
2006-12-07T11:52:00.000Z	Bakefy	nolimitsoya	my version (6.10 Edgy) is different
2006-12-07T11:53:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Bakefy	from what?
2006-12-07T11:53:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Bakefy	then adapt them. its perfectly simple: just add the aptline to /etc/apt/sources.list
2006-12-07T11:54:00.000Z	Bakefy	nolimitsoya	I am trying to do this the gui way, I guess I will try the text
2006-12-07T15:29:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Bakefy	if you want to install it we can. if you want it to work, no. go to the wine support channel
2007-01-02T07:56:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Bakefy	ctrl+h
2007-01-02T07:57:00.000Z	Bakefy	nolimitsoya	 I am having trouble seeing directories that I create from my windows machine on my Samba shared folders
2007-01-02T08:03:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Bakefy	anything beginning with a . is a hidden file in linux
2007-01-02T08:03:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Bakefy	to see them, use ctrl+h for nautilus and thunar :)
2007-01-02T08:04:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Bakefy	what sort of files are they?
2007-01-02T08:04:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Bakefy	elaborate please
2007-01-02T08:05:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Bakefy	can you navigate them through the terminal; did you refresh the filemanager?
