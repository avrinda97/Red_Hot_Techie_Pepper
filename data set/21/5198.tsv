2008-02-06T11:50:00.000Z	squarebracket		what the hell? what keeps editing my grub file....
2008-02-06T11:50:00.000Z	solid_liq	squarebracket	apt does that
2008-02-06T11:51:00.000Z	squarebracket	solid_liq	really... can i stop it from doing that? it keeps messing up my file causing me to have to boot from live cd :\
2008-02-06T11:53:00.000Z	solid_liq	squarebracket	not sure, but if you find out, let me know ;)  but, you don't have to boot from livecd...  are you running software raid, like I am?  just because that's why I software booted when I first discovered this prob...
2008-02-06T11:54:00.000Z	squarebracket	solid_liq	no, not even. just multiple partitions, XP in 0, vista in 1, linux in 2, and it keeps setting linux to boot from 1 for some reason :\
2008-02-06T11:54:00.000Z	squarebracket	solid_liq	what do you mean i don't have to boot from cd?
2008-02-06T11:54:00.000Z	solid_liq	squarebracket	grub still comes up, or no?
2008-02-06T11:55:00.000Z	solid_liq	squarebracket	k, go to the menu item you wish to boot, and press 'e' to edit it.  it'll bring you to another screen, with one set of params per line.  Hit 'e' on the line with the hd(0,1) or whatever, and fix it to be hd(0,whatever)
2008-02-06T11:56:00.000Z	solid_liq	squarebracket	then hit enter, and maybe 'b' for boot (I think)..  there's a quick reference to the buttons to press on the bottom of the screen
2008-02-06T11:56:00.000Z	squarebracket	solid_liq	oh, nice! i didn't know about that e part :) thanks! that will save me SO much hassle
2008-02-06T11:56:00.000Z	solid_liq	squarebracket	yeah, no kidding.  You know how to fix your grub config after that, right?
2008-02-06T11:57:00.000Z	squarebracket	solid_liq	ya, i do. i've had to do that a bunch recently
2008-02-06T11:58:00.000Z	squarebracket	solid_liq	now that i know it's an apt thing, i'll have to add a launcher to menu.lst on my panel :P
2008-02-06T11:58:00.000Z	solid_liq	squarebracket	k, well this'll make the problem less of a pain then at least ;)  for me, it's changing hd(1,0) to hd(0,0)...  I grep'd through /etc/, but I can't find where it stores to use hd(1,0)
2008-02-06T11:59:00.000Z	solid_liq	squarebracket	apt will only change it, though, when it updates your kernel
2008-02-06T11:59:00.000Z	solid_liq	squarebracket	or grub
2008-02-06T12:01:00.000Z	squarebracket	solid_liq	ya, i figured that out when you said apt, cuz i saw that i was updating some linux-<name> packages. at least now i know why this keeps happening.
2008-02-06T12:02:00.000Z	squarebracket	solid_liq	maybe i'll do some forum searching for the issue when i have some free time
2008-02-06T12:18:00.000Z	solid_liq	squarebracket	yeah, it'd be a good idea...  I just haven't had time for that myself, either..  You can always find me in ##linux-coders in case you figure it out and want to let me know (and remember to) ;)
2008-02-06T12:19:00.000Z	squarebracket	solid_liq	if i remember, i will :)
2008-02-06T12:22:00.000Z	solid_liq	squarebracket	k thanks :)
