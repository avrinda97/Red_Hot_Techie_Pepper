2011-09-06T17:59:00.000Z	lucenut		Google brings up things for 8

2011-09-06T18:53:00.000Z	usr13	lucenut	and one or more of those you will want to resize, (make smaller), in order to get enough free space to install Ubuntu.
2011-09-06T18:56:00.000Z	usr13	lucenut	You have to make room for the new Linux install.  If you want to delete all that is there, tell it to use entire disk.  If you want to do Dual Boot, resize the MS Windows partition so a smaller size, maybe  half, (depending on how much data you have in it).
2011-09-06T18:57:00.000Z	usr13	lucenut	Look at how much free space you have and decide how to allocte for Linux. Or tell us how much free space you come up with and we will help you decide.  Or, you can let the installer do the automatic allocation.
2011-09-06T18:58:00.000Z	usr13	lucenut	That is plenty, use the 198G of free space.
2011-09-06T18:58:00.000Z	usr13	lucenut	And let ubuntu automatically decide and re-partition for itself.
2011-09-06T18:59:00.000Z	usr13	lucenut	Look at the available options and think about it.
2011-09-06T19:00:00.000Z	usr13	lucenut	You only need about 3 or 4G for swap
2011-09-06T19:01:00.000Z	usr13	lucenut	You are correct, those are not important, you can just leave them as is.
2011-09-06T19:01:00.000Z	usr13	lucenut	How much RAM does this PC have?
2011-09-06T19:02:00.000Z	usr13	lucenut	Then 1 or 2G of swap is fine.
2011-09-06T19:06:00.000Z	usr13	lucenut	So use about half of that one.
2011-09-06T19:07:00.000Z	usr13	lucenut	Resize
2011-09-06T19:10:00.000Z	lucenut	usr13	I highlight the 249843 partition and click "Change" and get an "Edit a partition" dialog. Nothing about resizing here.
2011-09-06T19:11:00.000Z	usr13	lucenut	If you fish around there, you should find out how to resize (shrink) the largest partion in order to create enough free space for the Linux install.
2011-09-06T19:12:00.000Z	usr13	lucenut	Have you already allocated some space for swap ?
2011-09-06T19:13:00.000Z	usr13	lucenut	Ok, well as I said, if you fish around there on that screen, you should find out how to set aside some free space for the linux install.  Shrinking the largest partition is basically what you are going to do.
2011-09-06T19:15:00.000Z	usr13	lucenut	Choose that largest partition, right-click on it, and you should come up with a context menu that offers resize as an option.
2011-09-06T19:16:00.000Z	lucenut	usr13	there is no context menu right-click in this installer screen.
