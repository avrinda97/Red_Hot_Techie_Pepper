2008-01-29T21:29:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	quaal	IT should be fine...
2008-02-10T03:18:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	quaal	Not sure if this will help but.. http://www.elated.com/articles/understanding-permissions/

2008-02-10T03:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	quaal	Sorry, I misunderstood...
2008-02-10T03:21:00.000Z	quaal	Jack_Sparrow	yea. its the opposite of regular chmod
2008-02-10T03:21:00.000Z	quaal	Jack_Sparrow	umask 002 = chmod 775
2008-02-10T03:21:00.000Z	quaal	Jack_Sparrow	and i dont see anywhere on this site describing umask
2008-02-10T03:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	quaal	https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/edubuntu-users/2007-April/000855.html   may be closer
2008-02-10T03:24:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	quaal	It says to edit /etc/gdm/Xsession and add the line  "umask 002"
2008-02-10T03:25:00.000Z	quaal	Jack_Sparrow	k will try that
2008-02-10T03:27:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	quaal	Let me know if that works.. if you dont mind

2008-02-10T03:28:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	quaal	thanks
2008-02-10T03:31:00.000Z	quaal	Jack_Sparrow	looks like a no.. just created a new file/folder and its still being created with only file access, no write access, for the group
2008-02-10T03:32:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	quaal	Sure looked like the right fix for that issue..
