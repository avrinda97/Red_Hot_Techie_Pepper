2012-11-04T00:17:00.000Z	bonhoeffer		does ubuntu lighten graphics on mouseover by default?
2012-11-04T00:18:00.000Z	bonhoeffer		i have a set of 64x64 px graphics, that light up with a great mouseover effect in nautilus (or whatever the explorer in 11.04)
2012-11-04T00:18:00.000Z	bonhoeffer		oh, 12.04 :)
2012-11-04T00:18:00.000Z	bonhoeffer		i can't figure out how the effect is happening -- there is no sprite, only a single image
2012-11-04T00:19:00.000Z	bonhoeffer		but mouseover looks great -- i'm trying to figure out if the designer designed this
2012-11-04T00:19:00.000Z	bonhoeffer		should i ask about this in another room
2012-11-04T00:19:00.000Z	ikonia	bonhoeffer	errr of course the design designed it, that's why he's the designer
2012-11-04T00:20:00.000Z	bonhoeffer	ikonia	no, did the designer design a mouseover for http://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/resources/free-social-media-icon-set
2012-11-04T00:20:00.000Z	ikonia	bonhoeffer	that's not really anything to do with ubuntu
2012-11-04T00:21:00.000Z	bonhoeffer	ikonia	make sense?
2012-11-04T00:21:00.000Z	ikonia	bonhoeffer	I'm sorry, it doesn't make sense to me what you're asking
2012-11-04T00:22:00.000Z	bonhoeffer	ikonia	you should check this out . . . you download the graphics -- there is a sweet mouseover effect _only_ in ubuntu
2012-11-04T00:23:00.000Z	ikonia	bonhoeffer	it's just a mouse over set of images
2012-11-04T00:23:00.000Z	ikonia	bonhoeffer	I don't understand what the issue/question is
2012-11-04T00:25:00.000Z	bonhoeffer	ikonia	no, it is not -- there is only one image there -- how can it be a "mouseover" set of images?
2012-11-04T00:26:00.000Z	ikonia	bonhoeffer	how do you know ubuntu is using this theme pack ? what page are you viewing them on ?
2012-11-04T00:31:00.000Z	bonhoeffer	ikonia	nautilus?
2012-11-04T00:31:00.000Z	ikonia	bonhoeffer	I'm sorry I don't understand what you are actually asking, I suggest asking the channel as I'm losing interest
2012-11-04T00:31:00.000Z	bonhoeffer	ikonia	you shouldn't -- this is very interesting
2012-11-04T00:32:00.000Z	ikonia	bonhoeffer	sorry, I've lost interest as it's not interesting to me and I don't understand what you are asking
2012-11-04T00:32:00.000Z	bonhoeffer	ikonia	fair enough
