2006-02-22T15:52:00.000Z	NET||abuse		Hi all, i'm seriously interested in playing with Xgl and either compiz or something along those lines... I am that crazy/stupid to do it on my laptop :)
2006-02-22T15:52:00.000Z	NET||abuse		where can i get the step by step to add it to my install? or is it easily installed with just dapper?
2006-02-22T15:53:00.000Z	elkbuntu	NET||abuse	try looking on the forums at http://ubuntuforums.org
2006-02-22T15:53:00.000Z	elkbuntu	NET||abuse	someone might have figured it, i dont know.
2006-02-22T15:54:00.000Z	NET||abuse	elkbuntu	p0windah: cheers,
2006-02-22T15:55:00.000Z	NET||abuse	elkbuntu	p0windah: any idea if people have managed to get all features working alright? and my main concern is supporting my graphics card... i'm actually not too sure if fglrx will support it.. ATI mobility radeon 7500
2006-02-22T15:55:00.000Z	elkbuntu	NET||abuse	what graphics card do you have?
2006-02-22T15:55:00.000Z	elkbuntu	NET||abuse	oh, right
2006-02-22T15:55:00.000Z	NET||abuse	elkbuntu	;) any clue if support is there for that card?
2006-02-22T15:56:00.000Z	elkbuntu	NET||abuse	there would be, however i'm not sure how. i do believe you might need kernel patches, but again i'm not sure. the forum will help you alot with that, as it's an ongoing issue with ubuntu afaik
2006-02-22T15:59:00.000Z	elkbuntu	NET||abuse	nothing wrong with stubborness
2006-02-22T15:59:00.000Z	NET||abuse	elkbuntu	p0windah: actually, if i can't get it workin on my laptop,, maybe i should try on my home desktop
2006-02-22T15:59:00.000Z	elkbuntu	NET||abuse	yup
2006-02-22T16:00:00.000Z	elkbuntu	NET||abuse	p0windah and none of which work for every card ;)
2006-02-22T16:01:00.000Z	elkbuntu	NET||abuse	p0windah on my dell optiplex g1 that has an ati card, it suffices for me to simply edit the config to make it use a lesser colour depth
2008-02-11T17:49:00.000Z	elkbuntu	NET||abuse	tail dmesg
2008-02-11T17:49:00.000Z	NET||abuse	elkbuntu	nooo,, you can't tail another command
2008-02-11T17:50:00.000Z	elkbuntu	NET||abuse	meh, just dmesg then
2008-02-11T17:54:00.000Z	elkbuntu	NET||abuse	it could be if the port is b0rked
2008-02-11T17:55:00.000Z	elkbuntu	NET||abuse	how old? it wouldt be usb 1 would it?
2008-02-11T17:56:00.000Z	NET||abuse	elkbuntu	is there a way to check,, it would be unusual,, maybe 2.5 years, maybe 3
