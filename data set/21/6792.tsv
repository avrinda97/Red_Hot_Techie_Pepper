2007-02-09T13:04:00.000Z	AWOSDev7360	cafuego_	wow.  -n.  new switch for me, looks cool :)
2007-02-09T13:04:00.000Z	cafuego_	AWOSDev7360	uses numeric addresses, quicker coz no dns lookups.
2007-02-09T13:04:00.000Z	AWOSDev7360	cafuego_	yeah I see that...gateway 67.22.96.1 is easier to see than atlsfl.67-22-96-1.adelphia.net :P
2007-02-09T13:07:00.000Z	cafuego_	AWOSDev7360	I use -P DROP and do some state matching magic to allow certain protocols
2007-02-09T13:07:00.000Z	AWOSDev7360	cafuego_	right.  but does DROP mean "completely blocked and doesn't exist" or does it mean "blocked, and I'm telling the other computer that I'm dropping it"
2007-02-09T13:09:00.000Z	AWOSDev7360	cafuego_	hahaha morons table
2007-02-09T13:09:00.000Z	AWOSDev7360	cafuego_	isn't it better to DROP then REJECT?
2007-02-09T13:09:00.000Z	cafuego_	AWOSDev7360	For actual ahckers (as opposed to scripts) I prefer -j MIRROR
2007-02-09T13:09:00.000Z	cafuego_	AWOSDev7360	The default is DROP anyway
2007-02-09T13:09:00.000Z	AWOSDev7360	cafuego_	what is mirror?  haven't heard of that one
2007-02-09T13:09:00.000Z	cafuego_	AWOSDev7360	REJECT lists it as a closed port, DROP as filtered.
2007-02-09T13:10:00.000Z	cafuego_	AWOSDev7360	MIRROR sets the dest IP to the place it came from, so they effectively end up trying to hack their own machine.
2007-02-09T13:10:00.000Z	AWOSDev7360	cafuego_	hahahaha wow
2007-02-09T13:11:00.000Z	AWOSDev7360	cafuego_	lol...
2007-02-09T13:11:00.000Z	AWOSDev7360	cafuego_	but aren't you worried some noob is actually gonna DO that one of these days?
2007-02-09T13:12:00.000Z	cafuego_	AWOSDev7360	delete the rpm file? What would be the problem? ;-)
2007-02-09T13:12:00.000Z	AWOSDev7360	cafuego_	hahaha
2007-02-09T13:21:00.000Z	AWOSDev7360	cafuego_	duckdown: both of you make me laugh :D
2007-02-09T14:12:00.000Z	cafuego_	AWOSDev7360	you prolly won't get 802.11G then, but B only.
2007-02-09T14:12:00.000Z	cafuego_	AWOSDev7360	In which case, get an orinoco.
2007-02-09T14:12:00.000Z	AWOSDev7360	cafuego_	noted. thank you.
