2006-07-24T13:43:00.000Z	CanadaGradeEh		Hey, here's aquestion for y'all!
2006-07-24T13:43:00.000Z	CanadaGradeEh		Is there an application for displaying CPU information and hardware temperatures?
2006-07-24T13:43:00.000Z	CanadaGradeEh		Or just CPU temperature I guess
2006-07-24T13:44:00.000Z	CanadaGradeEh		!temperature
2006-07-24T13:44:00.000Z	CanadaGradeEh		lol
2006-07-24T13:44:00.000Z	CanadaGradeEh		orly?
2006-07-24T13:44:00.000Z	CanadaGradeEh		Called what?
2006-07-24T13:44:00.000Z	CanadaGradeEh		I assume I'll look in Synaptic for it
2006-07-24T13:44:00.000Z	Flannel	CanadaGradeEh	nah, just right click "add to panel"
2006-07-24T13:56:00.000Z	Flannel	CanadaGradeEh	Er...  warty to dapper?
2006-07-24T13:56:00.000Z	Flannel	CanadaGradeEh	you need to upgrade one at a time
2006-07-24T13:56:00.000Z	Flannel	CanadaGradeEh	warty > hoary > breezy > dapper
2006-07-24T13:59:00.000Z	Flannel	CanadaGradeEh	if you go to that link, it'll recurse backwards
2006-07-24T14:01:00.000Z	Flannel	CanadaGradeEh	warty should have bittorrent, just download the .torrent and use the headless one
2006-07-24T14:02:00.000Z	Flannel	CanadaGradeEh	ah, right.  it is optional in warty.  Go to a terminal, type 'bt' hit tab twice, get a list of your options
2006-07-24T14:02:00.000Z	Flannel	CanadaGradeEh	you're looking for a btdownload and then (well, in more modern ones) there's a few choices
2006-07-28T08:43:00.000Z	Flannel	CanadaGradeEh	technically.  But usually one won't need to
2006-07-28T08:43:00.000Z	Flannel	CanadaGradeEh	You sure you can't get it as a deb?
2006-07-28T08:43:00.000Z	Flannel	CanadaGradeEh	Java has a deb
