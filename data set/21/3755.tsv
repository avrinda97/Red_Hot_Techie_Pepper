2008-09-29T16:35:00.000Z	Nixot		Can anyone get me some help?
2008-09-29T16:36:00.000Z	Nixot		I am having problems running 3D apps.
2008-09-29T16:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Nixot	have you installed graphics drivers?
2008-09-29T16:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Nixot	desktop effects make a lot of stuff not work right
2008-09-29T16:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Nixot	run lspci and look at the line that says about your soundcard, then websearch from there
2008-09-29T16:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Nixot	ive seen it do crazy stuff in here, even disabling left mouse click
2008-09-29T16:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Nixot	read the screen
2008-09-29T16:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Nixot	one line will say what soundcard you have
2008-09-29T16:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Nixot	ive had desktop effects enabled for about an hour before i got frustrated and switched back to fluxbox
2008-09-29T16:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Nixot	sounds good
2008-09-29T16:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Nixot	instead of gnome / kde / compiz ... i use fluxbox
2008-09-29T16:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Nixot	gimme a sec, ill get you a screen grab

2008-09-29T16:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Nixot	indeed, and fast
2008-09-29T16:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Nixot	have you tried changing you sound prefs to ALSA?
2008-09-29T16:55:00.000Z	Nixot	ActionParsnip	Didn't work. Sorry. I clicked ALSA, then pressed Test, and there was a big error.
2008-09-29T16:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Nixot	awesome (i have the same card ;))
2008-09-29T16:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Nixot	we all like to help
2008-09-29T17:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Nixot	turn down software volume, then crank speakers
2008-09-29T17:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Nixot	use whatever mixer you use to lower the volume levels
