2009-05-10T21:00:00.000Z	sawaf		someone please help me resolve this dependency error on Jaunty http://rafb.net/p/4j2exU35.html
2009-05-10T21:00:00.000Z	jrib	sawaf	no idea why that could possibly be?
2009-05-10T21:01:00.000Z	sawaf	jrib	dunno really
2009-05-10T21:01:00.000Z	jrib	sawaf	well... did you recently enable any repositories?  Or install any debs outside the official repositories?
2009-05-10T21:02:00.000Z	sawaf	jrib	yes .. I enabled kubuntu experimental but then I disabled it again and removed amarok
2009-05-10T21:02:00.000Z	sawaf	jrib	and I now I can't re-install it
2009-05-10T21:03:00.000Z	jrib	sawaf	removing repositories does not remove software
2009-05-10T21:04:00.000Z	sawaf	jrib	I removed amarok too after I installed it from the experimental repository
2009-05-10T21:04:00.000Z	sawaf	jrib	and I autoremoved all the deps
2009-05-10T21:05:00.000Z	sawaf	jrib	so ?
2009-05-10T21:08:00.000Z	sawaf	jrib	any suggestions ? please ?
2009-05-10T21:09:00.000Z	jrib	sawaf	pastebin information (i'm a bit busy atm)
2009-05-10T21:09:00.000Z	jrib	sawaf	basically run « apt-cache policy PACKAGE » on those packages that don't install.  Try to install just that package that is in the error and then run « apt-cache policy » on that too
2009-05-10T21:15:00.000Z	sawaf	jrib	I dunno why it wants to fetch the experimental packages again !
2009-05-10T21:27:00.000Z	sawaf	jrib	nothing :-(
2009-05-10T21:28:00.000Z	jrib	sawaf	did you pastebin anything?
