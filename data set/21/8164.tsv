2006-07-04T05:47:00.000Z	wildman		hello *
2006-07-04T05:48:00.000Z	SonicChao	wildman	Hello, what seems to be the problem?
2006-07-04T05:55:00.000Z	wildman	SonicChao	euh... no pb, just being polite ;)
2006-07-11T15:01:00.000Z	SonicChao	wildman	What applications?
2006-07-11T15:02:00.000Z	wildman	SonicChao	many installed through Synaptic...
2006-07-11T15:02:00.000Z	wildman	SonicChao	didn't keep a record of 'which' ones, but many
2006-07-11T15:02:00.000Z	SonicChao	wildman	sorry...need specifics
2006-07-11T15:02:00.000Z	wildman	SonicChao	yeah... next time I need to install one, and I don't see it in the menu, I'll let you know
2006-07-11T15:03:00.000Z	SonicChao	wildman	Sometimes they dont show up on their own
2006-07-11T15:03:00.000Z	SonicChao	wildman	Type the name of the app in a terminal to see what happens
2006-07-11T15:03:00.000Z	wildman	SonicChao	it works
2006-07-11T15:03:00.000Z	SonicChao	wildman	Like to start Firefox, type "firefox"
2006-07-11T15:03:00.000Z	wildman	SonicChao	I'm no newbie ;)
2006-07-11T15:04:00.000Z	SonicChao	wildman	XD ok
2006-07-11T15:04:00.000Z	wildman	SonicChao	OTOH, newbies will be VERY dissapointed by this behaviour
2006-07-11T15:04:00.000Z	wildman	SonicChao	I mean, think as a newbie (one of this OS' main target): you install a package, and you don't have any menu entry for it... how would you feel?
2006-07-11T15:05:00.000Z	SonicChao	wildman	As a user for 2 months, in the beginning I would have been quite pissed...
2006-07-11T15:05:00.000Z	wildman	SonicChao	heck, even Windows users (another main target of this OS') are used to have menu entries added for 'em after installing an app
2006-07-11T15:06:00.000Z	SonicChao	wildman	its getting better everyday...:)
2006-07-11T15:16:00.000Z	wildman	SonicChao	you've asked me to concrete examples of apps not appearing in the menu? foobilliard is one of them (3D OpenGL pool/snooker/billiard game)
2006-07-11T15:16:00.000Z	wildman	SonicChao	I can run it fine from the CLI, don't have ANY menu entry for it, and beagle doesn't find it as an app (I have beagle to search 'all')
