2010-05-12T23:35:00.000Z	Mike1	helios_	it works sporadically, so what can the keymap have to do with it?
2010-05-12T23:37:00.000Z	helios_	Mike1	By sporadic do you mean they'll work and then stop mid-use, or they'll work on boot but the next boot they wont?
2010-05-12T23:37:00.000Z	Mike1	helios_	the first thing
2010-05-12T23:38:00.000Z	helios_	Mike1	Any common action that causes it? Opening/Using a certain program, etc.?
2010-05-12T23:38:00.000Z	Mike1	helios_	no
2010-05-12T23:39:00.000Z	Mike1	helios_	it also happened in GDM once
2010-05-12T23:39:00.000Z	Mike1	helios_	and in TTY
2010-05-12T23:41:00.000Z	Mike1	helios_	it’s very widespread so there should be bugreports … but I just found one descriping a bug where the whole keyboard and/or touchpad freeze
2010-05-12T23:42:00.000Z	helios_	Mike1	your laptop have a function lock on it? I had a laptop with a hardware function lock key, easy to accidentally engage it.
2010-05-12T23:42:00.000Z	Mike1	helios_	no, nothing like that
2010-05-12T23:43:00.000Z	Mike1	helios_	it only occures since the latest RC of Lucid
2010-05-12T23:43:00.000Z	Mike1	helios_	with Karmic and all the lucid betas before it worked
2010-05-12T23:43:00.000Z	Mike1	helios_	I even did a complete reinstall
2010-05-12T23:45:00.000Z	Mike1	helios_	i think so
2010-05-12T23:46:00.000Z	Mike1	helios_	bug fix-releases etc. have occured since then of course
2010-05-12T23:47:00.000Z	helios_	Mike1	Damn I'm at a loss...

2010-05-12T23:47:00.000Z	Mike1	helios_	i’ve searched and guessed for hours
2010-05-12T23:47:00.000Z	Mike1	helios_	and hurted my hand by slamming it :D
