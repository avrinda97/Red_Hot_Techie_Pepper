2008-02-25T00:46:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Ashfire908	you want ssh or sshd to bind to an interface?
2008-02-25T00:46:00.000Z	Ashfire908	zcat[1]	sshd
2008-02-25T00:47:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Ashfire908	did you install it? By default you only have ssh, and  sudo apt-get install ssh  installs sshd
2008-02-25T00:47:00.000Z	Ashfire908	zcat[1]	yes, sshd is installed.
2008-02-25T00:48:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Ashfire908	and you want it to bind to only one interface? by default it will listen to 0.0.0.0
2008-02-25T00:48:00.000Z	Ashfire908	zcat[1]	the system acts as a gateway and i don't want it to listen on the internet interface
2008-02-25T00:49:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Ashfire908	edit /etc/ssh/sshd_conf -- set 'listenaddress' to be the IP of the interface you want it listening on
2008-02-25T00:51:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Ashfire908	you might be better off setting up a firewall rule then, just block port 22 from the outside?
2008-02-25T00:52:00.000Z	Ashfire908	zcat[1]	but there is a server internally which has sshd which i plan to forward new incomming connections to that server
2008-02-25T00:53:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Ashfire908	run the internal sshd on a nonstandard port then
2008-02-25T00:53:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Ashfire908	and you can redirect port 22 from the outside to the internal server, from the inside to localhost:wherever
2008-02-25T00:53:00.000Z	Ashfire908	zcat[1]	...
2008-02-25T00:54:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Ashfire908	at least I think you can do that..
2008-02-25T00:57:00.000Z	Ashfire908	zcat[1]	i'm just not going to bind to the dhcp interface
2008-02-25T00:58:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Ashfire908	if the interface you won't want is dhcp and the internal one has a static IP address, there shouldn't be a problem then. Bind to the internal IP.
2008-02-25T01:01:00.000Z	Ashfire908	zcat[1]	i have three interfaces, eth0, eth1, and ppp0. i don't want to bind to ppp0. eth0 is dhcp, eth1 is static. i'm jest going to make eth0 static, it'll make my life easier because i use the different eth interfaces for different ips for when my network is in different configurations.
2008-02-25T01:02:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Ashfire908	I'd bind to all and use a firewall rule to block (or redirect) ppp0
2008-04-06T00:20:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Ashfire908	could be dust built up in the CPU heatsink?
2008-04-06T00:21:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Ashfire908	open a terminal and run 'top' -- see if there are any processes using 100% cpu of if the load average keeps going up
2008-04-06T00:22:00.000Z	Ashfire908	zcat[1]	i have a system montior applet and i don't really see a lot of cpu usage... actaually i noitce nearly 100% iowait cpu usage
