2007-10-03T09:30:00.000Z	Vlet	heman	Unless you're feeling brave, wait until it's released. 15 days.

2007-10-03T09:32:00.000Z	Vlet	heman	no, it's fine :)
2007-10-03T09:52:00.000Z	Vlet	heman	It's kind of like wearing a seat belt.
2007-10-03T09:53:00.000Z	Vlet	heman	If you have to type "sudo some-command" then type a password, you're more likely to think a little bit more about what you're about to do
2007-10-03T09:53:00.000Z	Vlet	heman	I have in the past, accidentally deleted lots of very important things because I forgot I was logged in as root, and mistook which directory I was in
2007-10-03T09:55:00.000Z	Vlet	heman	linux is a powerful thing, and can be a little confusing at the beginning. it's best to just log in as your mortal user; you never know when you can accidentally do something bad :)
2007-10-03T09:56:00.000Z	heman	Vlet	ok urm how do I make a mortal user?
2007-10-03T09:56:00.000Z	Vlet	heman	well, when you log into your system, you log in as 'heman', right? (or whatever your username is)
2007-10-03T09:57:00.000Z	Vlet	heman	well, then you're set. your user can not delete/modify important system files without specifically telling the computer that you want to do so
2007-10-03T09:59:00.000Z	Vlet	heman	well, if you see some cool how-to on ubuntuforums that tells you how to modify your system to do nifty things, you'll likely need to have 'super-user privileges'. In gnome (that's the name of the graphical interface un ubuntu) some apps will ask you to enter your password again to allow that app to do superuser stuff (like add accounts)
2007-10-03T10:01:00.000Z	Vlet	heman	that's normal at first, but once your system is set up well, you'll rarely have to do so. I haven't had to enter mine in a few days
2007-10-03T10:02:00.000Z	Vlet	heman	btw, there aren't really any 'bad' commands, it's more how you use them. If I were in a directory /home/vlet/somestuff/ and I wanted to get rid of everything (including sub-folders) I would type: rm -Rf *
2007-10-03T10:03:00.000Z	Vlet	heman	but if I was logged in as root but forgot I was, and happened to think I was in /home/vlet/somestuff, but was actually in / and typed rm -Rf *, it would delete everything on the computer
2007-10-03T10:06:00.000Z	Vlet	heman	If you wonder what a certain command does, type: man killall
2007-10-03T10:10:00.000Z	Vlet	heman	Well, as long as you're logged in as your regular user, nothing you do can wreck your install of ubuntu... only the files and settings for that user
2007-10-03T10:11:00.000Z	Vlet	heman	Like, you can make a huge mess in your room, but it's not going to effect the foundation of your hosuer
2007-10-03T10:14:00.000Z	Vlet	heman	well, as a regular user the only thing you could do is mess up your preferences/desktop kind of stuff. That's why not running as root is good. you can go nuts with weird commands, and it won't break the OS
2007-10-03T10:15:00.000Z	Vlet	heman	then you're a regular user
2007-10-03T10:15:00.000Z	Vlet	heman	glad to help :)
