2011-06-19T17:05:00.000Z	foormea		apparently <ip>:/path/to/dir is correct
2011-06-19T17:07:00.000Z	foormea		and i still can't understand why my nfs is not working :(
2011-06-19T17:08:00.000Z	usr13	foormea	What is the problem?  Can't mount it?
2011-06-19T17:09:00.000Z	usr13	foormea	pastebinit /etc/fstab #on client side.  pastebinit /etc/exports #on server side, and we'll have a look.
2011-06-19T17:10:00.000Z	foormea		ok
2011-06-19T17:11:00.000Z	foormea		http://paste.ubuntu.com/629336/ for /etc/exports
2011-06-19T17:12:00.000Z	foormea		no entry in the fstab for now as i'm trying manually. command i issue on the client is:         sudo mount 192.168.1.7:/mnt/sauv sauv/
2011-06-19T17:13:00.000Z	foormea		service portmap status -> running. service nfs-kernel-server status -> nfsd running
2011-06-19T17:15:00.000Z	usr13	foormea	Is 192.168.1.7 the ip address of the server?  ...and can you ping it from client?
2011-06-19T17:15:00.000Z	foormea		yeah pingable. ssh-able
2011-06-19T17:16:00.000Z	usr13	foormea	does mount point sauv/ truly exist on the client?   Are you just outside of it when you issue this command?  If not try full path.
2011-06-19T17:17:00.000Z	usr13	foormea	Don't you want to use a fstab entry?
2011-06-19T17:17:00.000Z	foormea		path /mnt/sauv        exists as a mount point wherever it needs to exist
2011-06-19T17:17:00.000Z	foormea		fstab won't make a difference
2011-06-19T17:18:00.000Z	foormea		when i try to mount locally (server mounts on server), i get this:      mount.nfs: access denied by server while mounting 192.168.1.7:/mnt/sauv
2011-06-19T17:19:00.000Z	foormea		iridium: i've done a sudo dpkg-reconfigure portmap
2011-06-19T17:19:00.000Z	foormea		it does not use loopback
2011-06-19T17:19:00.000Z	usr13	foormea	are you using sudo to mount it>?
2011-06-19T17:19:00.000Z	foormea		yes
2011-06-19T17:20:00.000Z	foormea	Goliath	if i'm not mistaken kernel vm is the support for your cpu's virtualisations capabilities, which virtualbox uses. maybe i'm wrong though
2011-06-19T17:20:00.000Z	usr13	foormea	 Does it give error when you try to mount it?
