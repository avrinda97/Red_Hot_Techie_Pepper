2012-08-19T00:37:00.000Z	AndreP		Hello all, i maight need a little bit n00b help, but im fucking my brains in this
2012-08-19T00:39:00.000Z	AndreP		This is my question, i need a complete install of Ubuntu, i installed it through USB but made some mistakes in the Username, Computer Name and screwed already, and i want to reinstall again Ubuntu from the start... But when i acess the Boot Menu of BIOS, i choose USB, and instead of loading the Ubuntu Started (The one who lets you choose what to do), he goes straight to the OS and enters it...
2012-08-19T00:39:00.000Z	AndreP		How can i do, to start the install of Ubuntu 12 again, from the start? Thanks
2012-08-19T00:41:00.000Z	AndreP		anyone may help me? its really simple, but i cant find answer for it anywhere
2012-08-19T00:42:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	AndreP	Do you know what a partition is?
2012-08-19T00:42:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	AndreP	Do you know what a disk partition is?
2012-08-19T00:43:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	AndreP	I'm understanding perfectly fine.
2012-08-19T00:43:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	AndreP	Is this Ubuntu Server, or Ubuntu Desktop?
2012-08-19T00:43:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	AndreP	So your system isn't booting off the USB, then.
2012-08-19T00:44:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	AndreP	Go into BIOS, change boot order to include USB over HDD and/or CD, boot USB.
2012-08-19T00:46:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	AndreP	Then the USB is damaged causing it to fail to boot.
2012-08-19T00:48:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	AndreP	I have already just told you what's wrong.
2012-08-19T00:48:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	AndreP	You should /completely/ erase the USB disk, do a full format on it, wipe it, and re-install the Ubuntu Desktop images to it as you did before.
2012-08-19T00:50:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	AndreP	Now, the better question is. If you installed Ubuntu 10 minutes ago, why are you trying to do so again, immediately after?
2012-08-19T00:51:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	AndreP	Fix the USB disk, and use it to boot into recovery mode, instead of reinstalling.
2012-08-19T00:52:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	AndreP	Okay. Please do not ask for help when you don't want help. Good day.
2012-08-19T00:52:00.000Z	AndreP	Psi-Jack	im completly geting missunderstood! Im just doing what you said, im fixing the USB for installing again (just like you said), man thank you (and im not beeing ironic!)
2012-08-19T00:53:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	AndreP	No, I understand you perfectly. YOU are just refusing to learn and do things correctly.
2012-08-19T00:54:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	AndreP	No, don't. I don't care to help someone ignoring the help.
2012-08-19T00:56:00.000Z	AndreP	Psi-Jack	Im not ignoring someone's help... im just trying to follow the instructions you gave me... Fixing the USB wasn't what you said? Man, we're completly missunderstanding each other :/
2012-08-19T00:56:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	AndreP	You asked the wrong questions, and when corrected after being verbally beaten for them, you ignored the corrected instructions, and don't care to. Bye. We're done here.
