2012-03-27T04:09:00.000Z	anthropos		so you anticipate this command opening up a port on the remote server to which you can connect to from your local machine and have your traffic forwarded to wherever
2012-03-27T04:09:00.000Z	anthropos		right?
2012-03-27T04:11:00.000Z	anthropos		a sql server that is running locally, yes?
2012-03-27T04:11:00.000Z	anthropos		n00b, are you using the tor browser bundle
2012-03-27T04:12:00.000Z	anthropos		i need to keep straight what we are calling local and what we are calling remote. the sql server is running on the network which is local relative to the machine initiating the ssh connection, yes?
2012-03-27T04:13:00.000Z	anthropos		n00b, vidalia should have an option to specify a proxy, does it not?
2012-03-27T04:15:00.000Z	anthropos		n00b, are you sure the port, etc. is correct? what information does it ask for aside from host and port
2012-03-27T04:16:00.000Z	anthropos		n00b, you do not need or want a bridge unless your isp or country blocks tor traffic
2012-03-27T04:17:00.000Z	anthropos		n00b, if you ust have a regular proxy, that is not the same thing as a tor bridge
2012-03-27T04:17:00.000Z	anthropos		bridges are for people in places like iran, syria, etc.
2012-03-27T04:17:00.000Z	f3ck4r	anthropos	yeah!
2012-03-27T04:18:00.000Z	f3ck4r	anthropos	but he may want to help them ;>
2012-03-27T04:20:00.000Z	anthropos	f3ck4r	i think tor works in syria, and i think at least bridges work in iran
2012-03-27T04:21:00.000Z	anthropos	f3ck4r	they ahve in the past, but i dont think they do presently.
2012-03-27T04:21:00.000Z	f3ck4r	anthropos	nice then D;
2012-03-27T04:21:00.000Z	f3ck4r	anthropos	i ran myself at the time just for help D;
2012-03-27T04:22:00.000Z	anthropos	f3ck4r	nice :)
2012-03-27T04:29:00.000Z	f3ck4r	anthropos	i think slackware is more customizable in that terms
2012-03-27T04:30:00.000Z	f3ck4r	anthropos	yeah
2012-03-28T03:56:00.000Z	f3ck4r	anthropos	he is already gone. i think he don't understand the concept of exit node or a bridge / relay
2012-03-28T03:57:00.000Z	f3ck4r	anthropos	yeah
