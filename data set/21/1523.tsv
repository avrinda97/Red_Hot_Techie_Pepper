2010-08-13T09:25:00.000Z	picard1400		is there a permissions thig i have to set in LVM?
2010-08-13T09:26:00.000Z	KE1HA	picard1400	when you df is your LVM being listed, as in, can you acess it normally?
2010-08-13T09:32:00.000Z	KE1HA	picard1400	if you not seeing the lvm after boot, or with lvm lvdisplay, just to a sudo lvmchange -a y to activate it.
2010-08-13T09:35:00.000Z	KE1HA	picard1400	ok, and what are you not able to do after the install was complete?
2010-08-13T09:35:00.000Z	picard1400	KE1HA	ok LVM is running.. but when i install a program... it does not show in my application tab in Gnome
2010-08-13T09:36:00.000Z	KE1HA	picard1400	tha't more likely applicaiton specific, not all installed apps place an icon in one of the menu's which app is not showing up?
2010-08-13T09:39:00.000Z	KE1HA	picard1400	so it's no lvm non encrypted, then lvm encrypted and the problems are on the lvm encrypted install?
2010-08-13T09:41:00.000Z	KE1HA	picard1400	also, with the no LVM, did you elect encrypted drive there as well? in other worked, it it limited to LVM encrypt only or does the same happen with no LVM and encrypt?
2010-08-13T09:42:00.000Z	KE1HA	picard1400	ok, no what apps are you installing that's not showing up on the LVM encrypted setup ?
2010-08-13T09:43:00.000Z	picard1400	KE1HA	qt-facetrainer is not installing correctly
2010-08-13T09:45:00.000Z	KE1HA	picard1400	ok, im not up to speed on that app. But the no-encrypt v.s. encrypted LVM is what's puzzling me.
2010-08-13T09:47:00.000Z	KE1HA	picard1400	whar repo did you get the app from, it is a custom compile?
2010-08-13T09:48:00.000Z	KE1HA	picard1400	pass, without looking through the app, no way of tellign what's going wrong. are there any Ub-Supported apps not installign correctly ?
2010-08-13T09:50:00.000Z	KE1HA	picard1400	obvious question but, are you sure you have all the build deps met correctly?
2010-08-13T09:51:00.000Z	KE1HA	picard1400	and this is on a modified GMD install as well yes ?
2010-08-13T09:52:00.000Z	KE1HA	picard1400	but not a full Gnome or KDE install right?
2010-08-13T09:53:00.000Z	KE1HA	picard1400	I'd do like what we talked about last week, and do the Dev work on a full install, then scale it back to what you dont need.
2010-08-13T09:54:00.000Z	picard1400	KE1HA	right.. but like i said i did it without any of the fulll install.... without ecryption no probs..
2010-08-13T09:54:00.000Z	KE1HA	picard1400	I dont know mate, that does't make sense to me, but there's something in the build that' not rght for encrypted LVM's
2010-08-20T19:54:00.000Z	picard1400	KE1HA	hey
