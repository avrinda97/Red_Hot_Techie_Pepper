2009-02-03T20:34:00.000Z	scunizi	KenBW22	yes
2009-02-03T20:27:00.000Z	scunizi	KenBW22	that's not a question and makes no sense
2009-02-03T20:28:00.000Z	KenBW22	scunizi	well i remember it was in System > Administration in Gutsy, then hidden in Applications > Other in Hardy and in Intrepid i cant find it
2009-02-03T20:28:00.000Z	scunizi	KenBW22	find what?
2009-02-03T20:28:00.000Z	KenBW22	scunizi	the Screens and Graphics utility
2009-02-03T20:29:00.000Z	scunizi	KenBW22	resolution is changed in System>Preferences>screen resolution. If you're thinking of customizing the desktop try System>Preferences>appearance
2009-02-03T20:30:00.000Z	KenBW22	scunizi	Screen Resolution doesnt have as many options
2009-02-03T20:30:00.000Z	scunizi	KenBW22	what are you trying to change?
2009-02-03T20:30:00.000Z	KenBW22	scunizi	my resolution to 1152x864, SR is only giving me 1024x768
2009-02-03T20:31:00.000Z	scunizi	KenBW22	what kind of video card do you have?
2009-02-03T20:32:00.000Z	KenBW22	scunizi	nvidia, not installed drivers yet though
2009-02-03T20:33:00.000Z	scunizi	KenBW22	that's the reason.. system>admin>hardware drivers and enablel one.. then restart
2009-02-03T20:34:00.000Z	KenBW22	scunizi	so is Screens and Graphics completely obselete now?
2009-02-03T20:34:00.000Z	KenBW22	scunizi	what about the options it had that SR doesnt?
2009-02-03T20:35:00.000Z	scunizi	KenBW22	which options are you referring to ?
2009-02-03T20:35:00.000Z	KenBW22	scunizi	iit used to have loads of things like selecting drivers, manufacturer, screen type etc
2009-02-03T20:37:00.000Z	scunizi	KenBW22	the graphic system is handled by xrandr now.. you won't see much in xorg.conf.. so after installing the nvidia drivers you can install nvidia-settings .. that will give you lots of options.
2009-02-03T20:37:00.000Z	KenBW22	scunizi	so S&G was basically duplicating existing tools?
2009-02-03T20:38:00.000Z	scunizi	KenBW22	sort of.. they've just changed access to them..
2009-02-03T20:39:00.000Z	KenBW22	scunizi	oh, well thanks for the info
2009-02-03T20:40:00.000Z	scunizi	KenBW22	np.. things are a little different but the same if you know what I mean
