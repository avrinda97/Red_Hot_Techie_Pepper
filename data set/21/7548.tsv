2006-09-04T16:55:00.000Z	larry_		I'm going to take lack of a response as a no, so I'll post my question again

2006-09-04T16:55:00.000Z	larry_		<larryone> could it be a driver issue??
2006-09-04T16:55:00.000Z	larry_		<larryone> I shouldnt need to install drivers to use my SATA should I?
2006-09-04T16:55:00.000Z	larry_		sry
2006-09-04T16:55:00.000Z	redguy	larry_	pasting is not welcome here
2006-09-04T16:56:00.000Z	redguy	larry_	you could at least rewrite the question so that it would be one line
2006-09-04T16:58:00.000Z	redguy	larry_	hmm check if you have linux-restricted-modules installed
2006-09-04T16:59:00.000Z	redguy	larry_	which chipset do you have?
2006-09-04T05:00:00.000Z	larry_	redguy	how do I find out?
2006-09-04T05:01:00.000Z	redguy	larry_	your motherboard manual? running lspci perhaps?
2006-09-04T05:01:00.000Z	redguy	larry_	^^
2006-09-04T05:02:00.000Z	redguy	larry_	well, the modules should be installed with the kernel so it is not a driver issue...
2006-09-04T05:02:00.000Z	larry_	redguy	that was what lspci told me;  Intel Corporation 82801EB (ICH5) SATA Controller
2006-09-04T05:03:00.000Z	redguy	larry_	ok, could you paste me the output of dmesg ?
2006-09-04T05:03:00.000Z	redguy	larry_	to the pastebin of course, not on the channel ;-)
