2005-06-10T06:00:00.000Z	vanberge		howdy... new to ubuntu..  does ubuntu have a default root pw?  i dont recall setting one
2005-06-10T06:01:00.000Z	nate__	vanberge	there is a root, just his password isn't set
2005-06-10T06:02:00.000Z	nate__	vanberge	your current user can use sudo to do anything root can do, you just need to type in your current user's password when asked
2005-06-10T06:02:00.000Z	vanberge	nate__	 su - ?

2005-06-10T06:03:00.000Z	vanberge		sudo -u root passwd
2005-06-10T06:03:00.000Z	nate__	vanberge	why even bother setting a pword?
2005-06-10T06:03:00.000Z	vanberge		im a noob to ubuntu, but pretty good with linux.
2005-06-10T06:04:00.000Z	vanberge		heard about it alot, wanted to give it a shot
2005-06-10T06:04:00.000Z	nate__	vanberge	sudo allows you to do anything root can do from your current login
2005-06-10T06:04:00.000Z	nate__	vanberge	without su
2005-06-10T06:04:00.000Z	nate__	vanberge	and if you need a terminal as root, you can type in: sudo -s
2005-06-10T06:04:00.000Z	nate__	vanberge	all using your own password
2005-06-10T06:04:00.000Z	vanberge		im just trying to update my install
2005-06-10T06:05:00.000Z	nate__	vanberge	sudo can do that :)
2005-06-10T06:05:00.000Z	vanberge		wow... much different then what i am used to
2005-06-10T06:06:00.000Z	nate__	vanberge	what, the fact that it actually works, and not slowly?
