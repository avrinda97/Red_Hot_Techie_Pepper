2011-10-17T15:57:00.000Z	sl__		I did check for startup bugs, but there wasn't anything reported which would exactly correspond my situation. I also removed apache2 using bum and set it back. Everything seems to be fine, but it still fails to start. And logs won't contain anything helpful.
2011-10-17T15:58:00.000Z	jrib	sl__	ls -l /etc/rc*/*apache2*
2011-10-17T15:59:00.000Z	sl__	jrib	hit, rc0-6 all levels linked to init.d/apache2
2011-10-17T15:59:00.000Z	jrib	sl__	can you just pastebin?
2011-10-17T15:59:00.000Z	sl__	jrib	naturally. http://pastebin.com/DGC0Z5rk
2011-10-17T16:00:00.000Z	jrib	sl__	the releases notes says there were some changes to how upstart handles the sys-v-init scripts, I'd start there.  Anything interesting in /etc/default/apache2?
2011-10-17T16:01:00.000Z	sl__	jrib	not as far as I know. http://pastebin.com/nHi7utVp
2011-10-17T16:02:00.000Z	jrib	sl__	"more reliable handling of legacy sysvinit scripts" I'd try to figure out what that means :P
2011-10-17T16:03:00.000Z	sl__		Yep. I did fair share of Googling before ending here. Because I didn't find anything that really would solve the issue. But I'm sure googling after a while or some update will fix the problem. The trick by ActionS works just fine before that.
2011-10-17T16:04:00.000Z	sl__		I do use piping to logrotate, if it could have anything to do with this. Otherwise all configs are pretty simple.
2011-10-17T16:04:00.000Z	jrib	sl__	do any other scripts in /etc/init.d fail?
2011-10-17T16:05:00.000Z	jrib		mononofu: use gconftool-2
2011-10-17T16:05:00.000Z	jrib		mononofu: erm, not sure if that's true with unity actually
2011-10-17T16:05:00.000Z	sl__	jrib	nope, not anymore. But used to, because some paths were missing. lock pid paths etc...
2011-10-17T16:06:00.000Z	sl__	jrib	my friends server failed to start sphinxsearch due /var/run/sphinxsearch path missing
2011-10-17T16:07:00.000Z	sl__		So it seems quite common that some paths need to be created after dist-upgrade.
2011-10-17T16:09:00.000Z	jrib	sl__	well that's in the release notes (the change to /var/run and some other directories)
2011-10-17T16:09:00.000Z	jrib		!notes | sl__
2011-10-17T16:09:00.000Z	jrib	sl__	maybe that's what you need to do
2011-10-17T16:10:00.000Z	jrib	sl__	so maybe some config was changet do look at /run instead of /var/run?
2011-10-17T16:15:00.000Z	jrib	sl__	what's the output of: grep -i '^concurrency=' /etc/init.d/rc
