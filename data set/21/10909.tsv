2004-10-31T17:50:00.000Z	|trey|	sladen	Warty is perhaps... Hoary surely won't be able to be classified the same though  :/
2004-12-15T09:42:00.000Z	|trey|	sladen	thats too broad a question... he might start describing letters or something  :(
2004-12-15T09:43:00.000Z	|trey|	sladen	beat you, nana
2004-12-15T09:49:00.000Z	sladen	|trey|	please don't.  that is almost as bad as using 'su'
2004-12-15T09:52:00.000Z	|trey|	sladen	its the same as... but when you have to issue more then one command as root, sudo itself gets tedious...
2004-12-15T09:53:00.000Z	sladen	|trey|	most of the commands you issue when ''working as root'' don't need to be run as root
2004-12-15T09:53:00.000Z	|trey|	sladen	umm, wrong...
2004-12-15T09:53:00.000Z	sladen	|trey|	you should be using  sudo  in front of the actual commands that do need it
2004-12-15T09:53:00.000Z	|trey|	sladen	*I* only do whats needed  :/
2004-12-15T09:54:00.000Z	sladen	|trey|	that is good practise.  Do you keep an audit log of what you're doing?
2004-12-15T09:55:00.000Z	|trey|	sladen	I dunno... annoyances with pipes is my main reason... I never remember, so I just use sudo -s  :/
2004-12-15T10:15:00.000Z	|trey|	sladen	root is still there, just can't be logged into... can still be compromised as user 0 either way   :/
2004-12-15T10:16:00.000Z	sladen	|trey|	correct.  I think you've proved your own point (or rather Roptaty's)
2004-12-15T10:18:00.000Z	|trey|	sladen	I argued that sudo is a better option... it is far better then wheel as my example... however if a hacker really wants access, there is no way to stop them... there is always a way...
2004-12-15T10:18:00.000Z	sladen	|trey|	correctly.  exactly.
2004-12-15T10:19:00.000Z	|trey|	sladen	he is taking the argument out of the realm of even his point...
2004-12-15T10:20:00.000Z	sladen	|trey|	I know  :-)   But it's proving mild intellectual stimulation whilst my food is cooking...
2004-12-15T10:21:00.000Z	|trey|	sladen	Killing time is always fun  :)
2004-12-15T10:24:00.000Z	|trey|	sladen	that only does it for the current session... editing .bash_profile etc will run it all the time, then sourcing the file will make it work now...
2004-12-15T10:34:00.000Z	|trey|	sladen	no... there are 15,000 in base/universe ... only like 2,000 in base though  :/
