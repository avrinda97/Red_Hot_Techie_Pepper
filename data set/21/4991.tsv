2011-06-14T08:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	swim	what sort of file is it?
2011-06-14T08:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	swim	http://filext.com/file-extension/SCR  shows 7 possible files it could be. telling us only the extension tells us nothing
2011-06-14T08:26:00.000Z	swim	ActionParsnip	it is supposed to be image files.  However, it is saved in the .scr windows screen saver format..  idk why, i just know i've had a heck of a time viewing them
2011-06-14T08:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	swim	if its an image file then open it with a viewer. What does the 'file' command say it is?
2011-06-14T08:28:00.000Z	swim	ActionParsnip	i've tried several image viewers.. most won't recognize it as a supported file.. the only one that will is ristretto, but it will not open them.. even when i switch over to xfce which the program is intended for
2011-10-20T05:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	swim	i'd imagine so
2011-10-20T05:59:00.000Z	swim	ActionParsnip	i've followed several "tutorials" and now i can't even get the basic ugly default one to start up from terminal
2011-10-20T06:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	swim	you could use gdesklets and junk.
2011-10-20T06:03:00.000Z	swim	ActionParsnip	are those any good?
2011-10-20T06:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	swim	i dont use stuff like that. I dislike desktop clutter like that. My system runs fine so CPU/RAM usage isn't interesting to me
2011-10-20T06:05:00.000Z	swim	ActionParsnip	i understand..  i'm using old equipment and just want to keep an eye on it..  i'm a sucker for old systems
2011-10-20T06:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	swim	same, but they are configured well :)
2011-10-20T06:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	swim	what CPU and RAM amount does it have?
2011-10-20T06:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	swim	mmmm tasty rum
2011-10-20T06:07:00.000Z	swim	ActionParsnip	idk why i said that, i like scotch
2011-10-20T06:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	swim	i have similar and run KDE, runs ok. The nvidia 6150 onboard helps a lot :)
2011-10-20T06:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	swim	http://www.webupd8.org/2011/03/system-monitor-indicator-puts-cpu-and.html  may help too
2011-10-20T06:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	swim	add the ppa (it supports oneiric) and install indicator-sysmonitor
2011-10-20T06:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	swim	I love LXDE
