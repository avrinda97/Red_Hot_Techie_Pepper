2009-03-26T11:01:00.000Z	DasEi	sophia	I assume you have gcc itself installed (apt) and put that code in a file ; I really have no idea about a plain sample code, more a question for #bash or c++basic
2009-03-26T11:03:00.000Z	DasEi	sophia	: * #c++-basic
2009-03-26T11:04:00.000Z	sophia	DasEi	I think i need some supporting libraries
