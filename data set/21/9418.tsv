2005-10-10T15:27:00.000Z	Hendric		can anyone help me how to speedup my ubuntu system??? i got AMD sempron 2200 + 128MB and i don't know why its seems so slow on ubuntu
2005-10-10T15:28:00.000Z	Hendric		128MB on XP is blazing fast...
2005-10-10T15:28:00.000Z	Severian	Hendric	 Sure, there are several things.
2005-10-10T15:30:00.000Z	Severian	Hendric	Here are two things to start. 1 install the 686 kernel.  2. Remove several virtual consoles.
2005-10-10T15:34:00.000Z	Severian	Hendric	no.  Don't remove the 386 kernel.  When you install the 686 kernel, grub is updated to boot to it anyway.
2005-10-10T15:35:00.000Z	Hendric	Severian	i tried the virtual consoles... im on a login prompt.. how can i get back to my desktop???
2005-10-10T15:38:00.000Z	Severian	Hendric	how much memory do you have?
2005-10-10T15:42:00.000Z	Severian	Hendric	is that system near you now and running?
2005-10-10T15:47:00.000Z	Severian	Hendric	and the next line.  The one that starts with Swap.
2005-10-10T15:50:00.000Z	Severian	Hendric	next, there is a line that starts with Cpu.  What is the percentage before id
2005-10-10T15:53:00.000Z	Severian	Hendric	it sounds like that to me.  Anothe 64 meg might even help, based on the numbers you gave earlier.  Do you have any spare memory?
2005-10-10T16:00:00.000Z	Hendric	Severian	the kernel-686 did improved the speed alittle... then i tried with 256MB and got a little improvement too... apps still loads so slow even the terminal
2005-10-10T16:05:00.000Z	Severian	Hendric	do you understand what I mean or should I paste examples?
2005-10-10T16:06:00.000Z	Severian	Hendric	some people just comment the lines out.  But, I like to still have lots of virtual consoles if I switch to run level 3.
2005-10-10T16:43:00.000Z	Severian	Hendric	not from w32codecs
2005-10-10T16:44:00.000Z	Hendric	Severian	how can i make it play mp3s or DVDs?? i can't play even mpg
2005-10-10T16:45:00.000Z	Severian	Hendric	by DVDs, do you mean encrypted ones?
2005-10-10T16:46:00.000Z	Hendric	Severian	any DVDs
2005-10-10T16:47:00.000Z	Severian	Hendric	google is your friend here.  I think it is against the law for me to decribe decss and so I won't do that..
2005-10-13T14:25:00.000Z	Hendric	Severian	i'm only using it on my own small network here.. no need for security..
2005-10-13T14:26:00.000Z	Hendric	Severian	i want it to act like the crappy windows network neighborhood... is that possible?
