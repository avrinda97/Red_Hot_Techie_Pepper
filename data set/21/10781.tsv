2004-11-23T08:41:00.000Z	ryan	eclipse	yeah well i think it might be a new 'feature'
2004-11-23T08:44:00.000Z	eclipse	ryan	do u know a way to disable that feature?
2004-11-23T08:44:00.000Z	ryan	eclipse	no; i'm looking for the changelog though to determine if its a bug or feature
2004-11-23T08:47:00.000Z	ryan	eclipse	unfortunately according to the NEWS file `nautilus 2.8.2 was updated without a news entry'
2004-11-23T08:47:00.000Z	eclipse	ryan	so it's a bug?
2004-11-23T08:47:00.000Z	ryan	eclipse	still don't know.
2004-11-23T08:49:00.000Z	eclipse	ryan	it was fine before i upgrade from xfree to x.org
2004-11-23T08:49:00.000Z	ryan	eclipse	yes, but when you upgraded to x.org, i'm sure your nautilus was updated as well
