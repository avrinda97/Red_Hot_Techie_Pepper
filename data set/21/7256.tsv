2006-11-03T11:50:00.000Z	Atomiku		Okay
2006-11-03T11:50:00.000Z	Atomiku		Ive put in another 128mb of ram into my computer
2006-11-03T11:50:00.000Z	Atomiku		ubuntu still wont get into gnome
2006-11-03T11:51:00.000Z	dom_f	Atomiku	 What happens when gnome tries to start?  What graphics card do you have?
2006-11-03T11:54:00.000Z	dom_f	Atomiku	 Just guessing - try editing your xorg.conf and changing the driver to vesa - do you know how to do that?
2006-11-03T11:54:00.000Z	Atomiku	dom_f	Nope
2006-11-03T11:54:00.000Z	Atomiku	dom_f	Nope
2006-11-03T11:57:00.000Z	dom_f	Atomiku	This may be worth trying - Press CTRL ALT F1 to get to a login prompt and login
2006-11-03T11:57:00.000Z	dom_f	Atomiku	Then sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.master
2006-11-03T11:58:00.000Z	dom_f	Atomiku	This copies your xorg.conf so we can always put it back later
2006-11-03T12:04:00.000Z	Atomiku	dom_f	one minute i'm just rebooting then Ill try that command you told me
2006-11-03T12:04:00.000Z	dom_f	Atomiku	- Wait I'll IRC you privately (this is a bit busy) and talk you through it.
2006-11-03T12:05:00.000Z	Atomiku	dom_f	Okay thanks man I appreciate it very much :)
2006-11-03T12:07:00.000Z	dom_f	Atomiku	I'm sending you a private irc - can you see it (If you're using xchat-gnome it'll be on the left below #ubuntu)
2006-11-03T12:09:00.000Z	dom_f	Atomiku	CTRL ALT F1 and login then 'sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etx/X11/xorg.conf.master' without the quotes
2006-11-03T12:11:00.000Z	dom_f	Atomiku	Now edit the file using nano - type 'sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf' (again no quotes) and you will get in a text editor.  Look for a section that says Section Device followed by Identifier and the name of your Graphics card
2006-11-03T12:11:00.000Z	dom_f	Atomiku	Change the driver line in this section from whatever it is now to vesa
2006-11-03T12:11:00.000Z	dom_f	Atomiku	Save it by hitting CTRL-O then CTRL-X
2006-11-03T12:15:00.000Z	dom_f	Atomiku	if it doesn't work then back to the terminal with CTRL-ALT-F1 and then "cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf.master xorg.conf" again no quotes!
2006-11-03T12:19:00.000Z	dom_f	Atomiku	Capital X in the X11
2006-11-03T12:20:00.000Z	dom_f	Atomiku	Make sure you have copied down all the steps - particularly the one about how to put the original file back!
