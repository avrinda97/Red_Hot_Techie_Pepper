2007-01-28T14:04:00.000Z	roho		is dapper the "stable" release?
2007-01-28T14:05:00.000Z	roho		what does that mean?
2007-01-28T14:05:00.000Z	roho		is edgy a version up?
2007-01-28T14:06:00.000Z	roho		so can you upgrade to edgy from dapper?
2007-01-28T14:06:00.000Z	roho		is it a headache?
2007-01-28T14:06:00.000Z	roho		so you wouldn't do apt-get dist-upgrade?
2007-01-28T14:07:00.000Z	roho		uh
2007-01-28T14:07:00.000Z	roho		i used the livecd
2007-01-28T14:07:00.000Z	cge	roho	It is quite easy as long as you didn't do anything inadvisable with repositories.
2007-01-28T14:07:00.000Z	roho	cge	such as?
2007-01-28T14:08:00.000Z	cge	roho	Using automatix or easyubuntu, adding a bunch of unstable repositories to your sources.list, removing ubuntu-desktop, and a few other reasons.
2007-01-28T14:09:00.000Z	roho	cge	is there a guide to upgrading to edgy? also something that lists problems after the fact?
2007-01-28T14:09:00.000Z	cge	roho	There probably is one on the wiki
2007-01-28T14:15:00.000Z	cge	roho	no
2007-01-28T14:17:00.000Z	cge	roho	It installs a bunch of unsupported software, basically.
2007-01-28T14:18:00.000Z	cge	roho	If the sources are in your sources.list, you probably did.
2007-01-28T14:19:00.000Z	cge	roho	No, because the software isn't even from our repositories.
2007-01-28T14:19:00.000Z	roho	cge	so i need to remove those repositories?
2007-01-28T14:20:00.000Z	cge	roho	It still might break. I seriously doubt it will break to the point where you won't be able to retrieve your data.
