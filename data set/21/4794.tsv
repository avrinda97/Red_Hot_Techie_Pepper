2008-02-08T09:44:00.000Z	_Oz_		gimpshop? where can I find that?
2008-02-08T09:44:00.000Z	_Oz_		Yeah, I guess it's not even worth discussing.  I absolutely must be able to run Photoshop.
2008-02-08T09:44:00.000Z	_Oz_		I understand that Crossover supports PS 7.0 at the "silver" (rather than gold) compatibility level which isn't good enough.
2008-02-08T09:45:00.000Z	_Oz_		I think the lowest I could go is Photoshop CS2.
2008-02-08T09:45:00.000Z	_Oz_		I found a tutorial explaining how PS2 could run under Ubuntu but I just can't make it go despite the explicit instructions.  Just doesn't seem to work for me.
2008-02-08T09:46:00.000Z	_Oz_		is there a way to stop ubuntu from asking me for a password whenever I access the filesystem or system tools?
2008-02-08T09:47:00.000Z	_Oz_		how soon will 8.04 come out? and, can I upgrade from within ubuntu or must I install anew?
2008-02-08T09:48:00.000Z	_Oz_		OK, Jack
2008-02-08T09:49:00.000Z	_Oz_		how do you upgrade, webu?
2008-02-08T09:49:00.000Z	_Oz_		Is it from within Ubuntu?
2008-02-08T09:49:00.000Z	Webu	_Oz_	yes, just a few commands, i think you can do it from GUI as well :)
2008-02-08T09:49:00.000Z	_Oz_		Nice, jangari
2008-02-08T09:49:00.000Z	_Oz_		This is so superior to XP
2008-02-08T09:49:00.000Z	Webu	_Oz_	or let's say you can do it even easier from GUI.
2008-02-08T09:50:00.000Z	_Oz_		We just need better driver support
2008-02-08T09:50:00.000Z	_Oz_		Jack
2008-02-08T09:50:00.000Z	_Oz_		Thanks for the help!  Enjoy your evening
2008-02-08T09:50:00.000Z	Webu	_Oz_	you could update from a 8.04 disc as well, but as long as you have 7.10 installed with Internet it's easier to do it within same Ubuntu :)
2008-02-08T09:51:00.000Z	_Oz_	Webu	that's what I really like about 7.10 (although it's the only version I've used).  Everything is so seamless.  Install programs and updates right from the interface.
2008-02-08T09:51:00.000Z	_Oz_		I installed it on my wife's old Dell desktop.  Gave it new life.  It easily has the power to run Ubuntu.
2008-02-08T09:51:00.000Z	Webu	_Oz_	that's nice to hear :)
