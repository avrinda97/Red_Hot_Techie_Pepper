2011-10-16T03:09:00.000Z	robinsch		HELP
2011-10-16T03:10:00.000Z	yeats	robinsch	it means that those packages were installed for a package that has gotten removed - 'sudo apt-get autoremove' will get rid of them
2011-10-16T03:36:00.000Z	yeats	robinsch	no, but the ubuntu-restricted-extras package should include flash
2011-10-16T03:37:00.000Z	robinsch	yeats	i know chromium browser has built-in flash right?
2011-10-29T04:36:00.000Z	yeats	robinsch	once mounted, it will show up at the mount point ;-)
2011-10-29T04:39:00.000Z	yeats	robinsch	'sudo mkdir /media/isofile'
2011-10-29T04:41:00.000Z	yeats	robinsch	sounds like your ISO file is corrupted
2011-10-29T04:42:00.000Z	yeats	robinsch	what is the output of 'file isofile.iso'?
2011-10-29T04:43:00.000Z	yeats	robinsch	then psycho_oreos is right - it's not an ISO file
2011-10-29T04:45:00.000Z	yeats	robinsch	file would've said this (or something like it) if it were an ISO file: # ISO 9660 CD-ROM filesystem data 'Ubuntu 11.04 amd64             ' (bootable)
2011-10-29T04:45:00.000Z	yeats	robinsch	it is
2011-10-29T04:55:00.000Z	yeats	robinsch	yes
2011-10-29T05:00:00.000Z	yeats	robinsch	you're dealing with proprietary software designed for Windows - that requires some hacking sometimes (and patience all the time)
