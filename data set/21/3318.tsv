2012-01-30T13:55:00.000Z	Krissed		Hi guys. I need to find casper.log where is that located ?
2012-01-30T13:56:00.000Z	aBound	Krissed	This is the only directory I found for casper: /var/log/installer/casper.log
2012-01-30T14:00:00.000Z	Krissed	aBound	thanks. Im having an issue with computer not booting after turning an installed Ubuntu into a ISO.. Basicly the ISO created and burned stops at Checking battery state (even on a desktop ). I figured it would be remastersys causing a problem (i install ubuntu and update it and stuff before running remastersys)
2012-01-30T14:01:00.000Z	aBound	Krissed	I had a few issues like that before it could be a variety of apps that may have caused the problem.
2012-01-30T14:04:00.000Z	Krissed	aBound	im using GDM because in lightDM i cant set the default session. I need it to be gnome fallback (unity isnt workable here)
2012-01-30T14:04:00.000Z	Krissed	aBound	are you saying that killing lightDM might cause it to not work ?
2012-01-30T14:05:00.000Z	aBound	Krissed	Understandable Unity should be fixed in 12.04.
2012-01-30T14:05:00.000Z	Krissed	aBound	preferbly just non-existing.
2012-01-30T14:05:00.000Z	aBound	Krissed	I was saying a variety of problems can cause Ubuntu to go into a "Checking battery state".
2012-01-30T14:06:00.000Z	Krissed	aBound	i just dont get it.. I have ubuntu installed. installed a few things like likewise-open and GDM and gnome-fallback. I have it so it only have fallback option. It all works just perfect. Except after i run remastersys and make it into an iso and attempt to boot from it
2012-01-30T14:08:00.000Z	Krissed	aBound	do you know any other programs that lets me turn an installed ubuntu into a ISO ?
2012-01-30T14:09:00.000Z	aBound	Krissed	Ubuntu 11.10 can be quite unstable for some as Unity has given me some issues and this version in general can be a headache. As bluetooth doesn't even seem to work either.
2012-01-30T14:09:00.000Z	aBound	Krissed	I would say use some other app for doing that but I can't say if one exist.
2012-01-30T14:09:00.000Z	aBound	Krissed	There is a alternative Ubuntu ISO which should allow you to customize your Ubuntu ISO.
2012-01-30T14:10:00.000Z	Krissed	aBound	agree but sadly its the ONLY version after 9.10 which works with likewise-open and having windows shares so i really dont have much of a choice
2012-01-30T14:16:00.000Z	aBound	Krissed	10.04 LTS was stable except it did have some issues.
2012-01-30T14:17:00.000Z	Krissed	aBound	yes it was stable but still. It doesnt work with likewise-open. not even 11.04 worked.
2012-01-30T14:18:00.000Z	aBound	Krissed	Agreed.
2012-01-30T14:19:00.000Z	Krissed	aBound	i checked the casper.log file and it says dbus.exceptions.DbusExceotion: org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.FileNotFound: Failed to connect to socket /var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket: no file or directory using CD-ROM mount point /cdrom <-- Does this give anything to why it could fail to boot ?
2012-01-30T14:21:00.000Z	aBound	Krissed	It's a possibly but that error isn't familiar to me as I never had it before.
2012-01-30T14:22:00.000Z	aBound	Krissed	I know this is an Arch related problem but might work for Ubuntu: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=50674
