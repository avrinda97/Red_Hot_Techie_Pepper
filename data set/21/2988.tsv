2009-04-28T21:11:00.000Z	kva_		I have Xubuntu 9.04 installed on my older computer, but get no sound. Have looked for onboard sound chip to disable in BIOS, but found no such option. Any obvious, simple solution you can think of? Thanks.
2009-04-28T21:11:00.000Z	neodragon	kva_	do you have a second sound card install
2009-04-28T21:12:00.000Z	kva_	neodragon	yes my soundcard works fine in Windows XP (dual-boot) and worked also in other Linuxes
2009-04-28T21:14:00.000Z	kva_	neodragon	sorry I misread your response -- no, I'm not aware of a second sound card, just read a suggestion on the web to disable onboard sound chip
2009-04-28T21:16:00.000Z	neodragon	kva_	if you go to the xubuntu control center there should be an option in there to configure your soundcard, see if it has the correct sound drivers enable. that would be a good place to start.
2009-04-28T21:16:00.000Z	kva_	neodragon	thanks
2009-04-28T21:17:00.000Z	neodragon	kva_	although I can't remember if that option is in the control center or under system on the menu xubuntu. I haven't actually used xubuntu for at least a year.
2009-04-28T21:18:00.000Z	kva_	neodragon	ok, but where is the controc center found?
2009-04-28T21:19:00.000Z	neodragon	kva_	it should be under the main menu in xubuntu. let me boot up my live cd of xubuntu on my other pc and see if I can find it for you.
2009-04-28T21:19:00.000Z	kva_	neodragon	thanks a lot
2009-04-28T21:29:00.000Z	neodragon	kva_	I only have xubuntu 8.04 and it won't boot on my other pc. My computer hardware is too new for version 8.04 apparently. Sorry can any one else help kva_ with his sound card issues in xubuntu 9.04
2009-04-28T21:29:00.000Z	kva_	neodragon	ok, thanks anyway
2009-04-28T21:30:00.000Z	neodragon	kva_	I am downloading xubuntu 9.04 right now.
2009-04-28T21:30:00.000Z	kva_	neodragon	ok
2009-04-28T21:34:00.000Z	neodragon	kva_	I am downloading it via bittorrent. It has about 15 minutes to go. hopefully someone can help you get started in the meantime I would repost your question for everyone else too.
2009-04-28T21:34:00.000Z	kva_	neodragon	ok, thanks, I'll do that
2009-04-28T21:35:00.000Z	kva_	neodragon	yes my soundcard works fine in Windows XP (dual-boot) and worked also in other Linuxes
2009-04-28T21:51:00.000Z	neodragon	kva_	I am burning xubuntu 9.04 to CD now. brb
2009-04-28T22:05:00.000Z	kva_	neodragon	just want to say I'm back
2009-04-28T22:09:00.000Z	kva_	neodragon	I aplogize, I have to leave, thanks for trying (could someone please tell him I had to leave? thanks)
