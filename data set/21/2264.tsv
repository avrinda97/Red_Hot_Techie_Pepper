2011-05-04T00:35:00.000Z	n-iCe		hi
2011-05-04T00:36:00.000Z	n-iCe		other tty got frozen, how do I unfroze it? I am in alt + ctrl + f4
2011-05-04T00:36:00.000Z	n-iCe		but I was downloading a big file
2011-05-04T00:36:00.000Z	n-iCe		I don't want to lose it
2011-05-04T00:36:00.000Z	n-iCe		can I move a proccess to other tty?
2011-05-04T00:37:00.000Z	n-iCe		nobody?
2011-05-04T00:38:00.000Z	lcb	n-iCe	let it go, probably a mem issue and it might go away in time.
2011-05-04T00:38:00.000Z	n-iCe	lcb	 I am downloading the file from chrome how can I see the % of downloading
2011-05-04T00:39:00.000Z	lcb	n-iCe	no other tty?
2011-05-04T00:39:00.000Z	n-iCe	lcb	yes I have the others tty I am in other right now
2011-05-04T00:40:00.000Z	lcb	n-iCe	command top
2011-05-04T00:41:00.000Z	lcb	n-iCe	you see if the process is running.
2011-05-04T00:41:00.000Z	n-iCe	lcb	chrome is running, of course, I wanna know the % of the download in chrome
2011-05-04T00:41:00.000Z	n-iCe	lcb	I can't even run startx again
2011-05-04T00:42:00.000Z	lcb	n-iCe	i don't know if is possible to do that. my suggestion is let the dld go and put the tty on the graphic environment afterwards
2011-05-04T00:43:00.000Z	n-iCe	lcb	 but how can I know when it finished
2011-05-04T00:43:00.000Z	lcb	n-iCe	by looking at top
2011-05-04T00:44:00.000Z	n-iCe	lcb	but says just chrome running, it does not say if the download finished
2011-05-04T00:45:00.000Z	lcb	n-iCe	but you have there much more than saying is running, don't you? you could have the idea by the load if the memory leak or whatever causing that drops down
2011-05-04T01:02:00.000Z	lcb	n-iCe	got it?
2011-05-04T01:02:00.000Z	n-iCe	lcb	just reboote
