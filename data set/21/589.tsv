2011-09-11T18:49:00.000Z	RocketmanTT		Anyone has experience creating a PPTP client from Ubuntu Server 11.0.4?
2011-09-11T18:50:00.000Z	yeats	RocketmanTT	what's your actual question about it?
2011-09-11T18:51:00.000Z	RocketmanTT	yeats	My issue is that I'm able to create the VPN connection but when I click it in NetworkManager, nothing happens
2011-09-11T18:52:00.000Z	yeats	RocketmanTT	did the NM icon change at all?
2011-09-11T18:53:00.000Z	RocketmanTT	yeats	no it didn't
2011-09-11T18:54:00.000Z	yeats	RocketmanTT	(the @ is not required in IRC - just type my name - tab complete works too) no error message at all?
2011-09-11T18:56:00.000Z	RocketmanTT	yeats	no errors...i used sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog but there are no errors except for this - <info> Unmanaged Device found; state CONNECTED forced. (see http://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/191889)
2011-09-11T18:57:00.000Z	yeats	RocketmanTT	so how did you set up the PPTP connection? via NetworkManager?
2011-09-11T18:57:00.000Z	RocketmanTT	yeats	correct, it was configured via NetworkManager and no errors encountered during configuration
2011-09-11T18:58:00.000Z	yeats	RocketmanTT	okay - sounds like you might want to set it up manually then - do you know how?
2011-09-11T18:58:00.000Z	RocketmanTT	yeats	not really
2011-09-11T18:59:00.000Z	RocketmanTT	yeats	well i've looked at the docs on the net but they're for the older versions
2011-09-11T18:59:00.000Z	yeats	RocketmanTT	they're probably still useful - that functionality hasn't changed really at all
2011-09-11T19:01:00.000Z	RocketmanTT	yeats	can you give me a link that will be most relevant to v11.0.4
2011-09-11T19:02:00.000Z	yeats	RocketmanTT	this looks pretty much right on: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/howto-configure-pptp-vpn-in-ubuntu-intrepid-and-jaunty.html
2011-09-11T19:02:00.000Z	yeats	RocketmanTT	that's more or less what I do
2011-09-11T19:04:00.000Z	RocketmanTT	yeats	thanks very much, i'll give it a shot
2011-09-11T19:04:00.000Z	yeats	RocketmanTT	feel free to ping me again if you hit a wall - I'm up and down, but paying attention ;-)
2011-09-11T19:05:00.000Z	RocketmanTT	yeats	no probs, we'll catch up
2011-09-11T19:10:00.000Z	RocketmanTT	yeats	question, is that link for hosting PPTP server?
2011-09-11T19:59:00.000Z	yeats	RocketmanTT	no - it's for the client
