2010-03-19T16:07:00.000Z	tryggvib		Hello, I was upgrading to 9.10 and when I restarted the computer grub didn't want to boot my hard disk and threw me into a initramfs shell. I've now booted up with a live cd but not sure what I should change. Can anyone help me so that I won't screw things up?
2010-03-19T16:09:00.000Z	tryggvib		the problem I'm having is the UUID identification... looking through a list of devices with ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid I don't see sda1
2010-03-19T16:10:00.000Z	abhi_nav	tryggvib	go to grub2 page and perform that last two processes of updating grub2
2010-03-19T16:11:00.000Z	tryggvib	abhi_nav	I'll try that
2010-03-19T16:11:00.000Z	abhi_nav	tryggvib	hmm
2010-03-19T16:15:00.000Z	tryggvib	abhi_nav	You mean the last two operations on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Grub2 right?
2010-03-19T16:16:00.000Z	abhi_nav	tryggvib	wait
2010-03-19T16:19:00.000Z	abhi_nav	tryggvib	you are using grub2? or grub
2010-03-19T16:20:00.000Z	tryggvib	abhi_nav	the one 9.10 uses after upgrade
2010-03-19T16:20:00.000Z	abhi_nav	tryggvib	(*I think*) upgrade from 9.04 to 9.10 doesnt update grub
2010-03-19T16:21:00.000Z	tryggvib	abhi_nav	so I'm still using grub 1, ok I'll try to work from there

2010-03-19T16:23:00.000Z	abhi_nav	tryggvib	hmm
