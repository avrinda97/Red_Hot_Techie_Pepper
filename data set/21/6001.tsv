2007-06-21T05:27:00.000Z	kravlin	wesolek	When your name is mentioned in a post x-chat marks it as red.
2007-06-21T05:28:00.000Z	wesolek		wow. cool
2007-06-21T05:28:00.000Z	wesolek		is it case sensitive?

2007-06-21T05:29:00.000Z	kravlin		Anyone know how to edit grub to let me get into windows? I tried Update_grub to no avail.
2007-06-21T05:29:00.000Z	wesolek		I just thought you had to type some sort of command like /msg or something
2007-06-21T05:29:00.000Z	kravlin		thats for private messages.
2007-06-21T05:30:00.000Z	wesolek	kravlin	on suse it was very easy... ubuntu is for more advanced users I think
