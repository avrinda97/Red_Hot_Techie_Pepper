2007-03-24T14:55:00.000Z	h1st0	Flannel	yeap
2007-03-26T10:49:00.000Z	h1st0	Flannel	he could pull the deb from packages.ubuntu.com
2007-03-26T10:50:00.000Z	Flannel	h1st0	that'd still require the internet.

2007-09-27T08:49:00.000Z	h1st0	Flannel	how would he restore perms
2007-09-27T08:50:00.000Z	Flannel	h1st0	since he's only changed the perm on / itself, all he'd have to do is set it back (755).  -R would make it a reinstall sort of thing.
2007-09-27T08:51:00.000Z	h1st0	Flannel	you mean recursive
