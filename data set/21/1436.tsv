2010-11-03T06:48:00.000Z	dzeremis		Hi guys. I need help. My laptop has done it again! The laptop has only a recent version of Ubuntu on it. No windows, no other partitions. Nothing more. At the beginning, I had problems getting it to recognize my laptop's wireless. Then we fixed that here at #ubuntu. Well, it's done it again.
