2007-05-06T15:13:00.000Z	Nubbie		omg.
2007-05-06T15:14:00.000Z	Nubbie		drk_guy: unmount, then eject i think.
2007-05-06T15:14:00.000Z	Nubbie		drk_guy: as long as the drive isn't mounted, you can safely shut it off.
2007-05-06T15:14:00.000Z	Nubbie		drk_guy: for beryl.
2007-05-06T15:15:00.000Z	Nubbie		drk_guy: go to #ubuntu-effects or #beryl for help with emerald themes.
2007-05-06T15:15:00.000Z	Nubbie		sorry drk_guy, i meant vickdini.
2007-05-06T15:15:00.000Z	vox754	Nubbie	I read the whole discussion about the video card... so, are ATI drivers included in the newer Feisty or what?
2007-05-06T15:16:00.000Z	Nubbie	vox754	no because ATI has not GPL'd their drivers.
2007-05-06T15:16:00.000Z	Nubbie	vox754	the open source ati and radeon drivers are available i believe though.
2007-05-06T15:17:00.000Z	vox754	Nubbie	then what the hell were you telling to crazlunatic ?
2007-05-06T15:18:00.000Z	Nubbie	vox754	fglrx drivers don't ship with ubuntu, but they are available in the repositories, now if you want to help him go ahead.
2007-05-06T15:21:00.000Z	vox754	Nubbie	see... you have to go easy on the nubs, otherwise they won't know ... they'll just repeat everything you say... you could've saved a lot of time and typing
2007-05-06T15:22:00.000Z	Nubbie	vox754	give crazlunatic some credit.
2007-05-06T15:30:00.000Z	vox754	Nubbie	crazlunatic it is "normal" if we can all it that way... The driver simply does not drive the hardware that well
2007-05-06T15:37:00.000Z	vox754	Nubbie	crazlunatic I do think is the video driver... when I used "vesa" it was slow, then changed to the correct "via" and it works without lag.
2007-05-06T15:37:00.000Z	Nubbie	vox754	changing from vesa to ati should have the same effect.
2007-05-06T15:38:00.000Z	Nubbie	vox754	the "ati" driver is the best available for his graphics card, and he's using it and still experiencing slowdowns.
2007-05-06T15:40:00.000Z	Nubbie	vox754	i do know better, as my graphics card is almost identical to his. the 9500 was the first card to have support for fglrx, and he's using a 9200. it was luck i have a 9550. also recently new drivers called radeon have been made, which support newer cards as well as mine, but still don't provide support >9500.
2007-05-06T15:40:00.000Z	Nubbie	vox754	he's stuck with the ati driver.
2007-05-06T15:43:00.000Z	vox754	Nubbie	what do you know about ati acquisition by VIA, do you think better cards and drivers are going to be developed?
