2004-10-05T07:03:00.000Z	dalderman	jdub	have you come up with any prices yet?
2004-10-05T07:03:00.000Z	dalderman	jdub	I refuse to pay for Windoze, but this... yeah
2004-10-05T07:03:00.000Z	jdub	dalderman	our model is unlikely to involve 'prices for support' on the website :)
2004-10-05T07:04:00.000Z	dalderman	jdub	so on a per company basis?
2004-10-05T07:04:00.000Z	jdub	dalderman	mmm, and via partnerships, etc.
2004-10-05T07:05:00.000Z	dalderman	jdub	we'll be using it at work, and we are willing to pay for support so info would be cool.  I'll watch the website
2004-10-05T07:05:00.000Z	jdub	dalderman	perhaps mail me with details
2004-10-05T07:05:00.000Z	jdub	dalderman	of what kind of support you're looking for, etc.
2004-10-05T07:05:00.000Z	dalderman	jdub	k
2004-10-05T07:06:00.000Z	dalderman	jdub	where is the best place to email?
2004-10-05T07:08:00.000Z	jdub	dalderman	jeff.waugh@canonical.com
2004-10-05T07:09:00.000Z	dalderman	jdub	do you know Ross B Soundjuicer man?
2004-10-05T07:10:00.000Z	jdub	dalderman	yeah
2004-10-05T07:10:00.000Z	dalderman	jdub	he sits next to me at work and eats my jelly babies :-)
2004-10-05T07:11:00.000Z	dalderman	jdub	I got him into Linux, he pulled me from RH to Debian and now Ubuntu
2004-10-05T07:11:00.000Z	dalderman	jdub	hehehe, not me, I get away with it, I mostly look after the network/servers (including windoze :-( )
2004-10-05T07:12:00.000Z	dalderman	jdub	although I do some dev when required, mostly C tho
2004-10-05T07:12:00.000Z	dalderman	jdub	Ross is a much better coder than me
2004-10-05T07:12:00.000Z	dalderman	jdub	and a very good friend :-)
2004-10-05T07:13:00.000Z	dalderman	jdub	I took the photos of him at his wedding that are on burtonini.com
2004-10-05T07:14:00.000Z	dalderman	jdub	I'll bring my 300D and snap all you like if I can blag the holiday :-)
