2007-06-19T07:41:00.000Z	niuq		i am reading the gftp's documentation and not sure what a bookmarks is
2007-06-19T07:41:00.000Z	niuq		there is any gftp channel?
2007-06-19T07:41:00.000Z	niuq		i know here is not the right place for asking about gftp
2007-06-19T07:42:00.000Z	Xenguy	niuq	I don't see why not
2007-06-19T07:42:00.000Z	niuq	Xenguy	i just thought this was a pure ubuntu support channel
2007-06-19T07:43:00.000Z	Xenguy	niuq	I would assume (without really knowing) that a bookmark would be a site you do file transfer to/from on a regular basis?
2007-06-19T07:43:00.000Z	Xenguy	niuq	I think general software questions are fine
2007-06-19T07:43:00.000Z	niuq	Xenguy	ohhh, ok, thank you! :)
2007-06-19T07:44:00.000Z	Xenguy	niuq	no problemo
2007-06-19T07:44:00.000Z	Xenguy	niuq	as in, you would bookmark such a site
2007-06-19T07:45:00.000Z	niuq	Xenguy	it is like a rapidshare site, or i am totally lost?
2007-06-19T07:46:00.000Z	Xenguy	niuq	I think you lost me ;-)  What is the question?
2007-06-19T07:47:00.000Z	niuq	Xenguy	ok, a bookmark it is just a site for transfer stuffs?
2007-06-19T07:49:00.000Z	Xenguy	niuq	here's my idea (which could be wrong of course): if you use a web browser, you might bookmark your commonly visited web sites; in the same way, if you use gftp for transferring files, you might bookmark ftp sites (or whatever) that you frequently visit.  Does this make sense?
2007-06-19T07:50:00.000Z	niuq	Xenguy	it's like saving on "my favorites" the sites i visit
2007-06-19T07:50:00.000Z	Xenguy	niuq	yeah, or so I assume
2007-06-19T07:50:00.000Z	niuq	Xenguy	yeah i think it made sense ^_^)!
2007-06-19T07:51:00.000Z	Xenguy	niuq	OK :-)
2007-06-19T07:51:00.000Z	niuq	Xenguy	ok thank you, i will continue my reading ^^! i'll be asking stuffs soon for sure
2007-06-19T07:52:00.000Z	Xenguy	niuq	yw, have fun
2007-06-19T07:52:00.000Z	niuq	Xenguy	i will ^^
