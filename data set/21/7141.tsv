2008-09-14T01:14:00.000Z	flyback		do I need to install all traces of a old kernel, if I use the whatever it's called compiler setup for a kernel that spits out a deb
2008-09-14T01:15:00.000Z	flyback		you are going to need a new internet connection if you don't stop trolling
2008-09-14T01:15:00.000Z	flyback		I am not in the mood
2008-09-14T01:15:00.000Z	flyback		nlindblad,
2008-09-14T01:15:00.000Z	flyback		what 64 bit cpu
2008-09-14T01:15:00.000Z	nlindblad	flyback	Core 2 Duo
2008-09-14T01:15:00.000Z	flyback		early modem intel or early model amd?
2008-09-14T01:16:00.000Z	flyback		duo's have a proper iommu, actually I think on intel it's still in the chipset
2008-09-14T01:16:00.000Z	flyback		what chipset
2008-09-14T01:17:00.000Z	nlindblad	flyback	T7250
2008-09-14T01:17:00.000Z	flyback		T7250 is the cpu
2008-09-14T01:18:00.000Z	nlindblad	flyback	You mean the motherboard?
2008-09-14T01:18:00.000Z	flyback		yes
2008-09-14T01:18:00.000Z	flyback		my point is if you have a chipset without a proper iommu
2008-09-14T01:18:00.000Z	flyback		the cpu might be getting pegged using bounce buffers
2008-09-14T01:19:00.000Z	nlindblad	flyback	No way to fix? How can I find out which chipset I have?
2008-09-14T01:19:00.000Z	flyback		lspci or lshw
2008-09-14T01:19:00.000Z	flyback	nlindblad	 it's just an idea I don't know if this is even the case
2008-09-14T01:22:00.000Z	nlindblad	flyback	Can't find the chipset model anywhere
2008-09-14T01:23:00.000Z	nlindblad	flyback	Perhaps I should go back to 32-bit
2008-09-14T01:24:00.000Z	flyback	nlindblad	 I don't know
