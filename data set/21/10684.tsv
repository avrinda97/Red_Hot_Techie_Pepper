2005-04-04T14:45:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		man
2005-04-04T14:45:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		I want a BTX motherboard
2005-04-04T14:47:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		but
2005-04-04T14:47:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		you don't need 3D acceleration for a web server
2005-04-04T14:48:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		I heard there was effort
2005-04-04T14:48:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		check #hardened-debian
2005-04-04T14:48:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		I think there's effort in ubuntu and debian by the ubuntu and debian teams; I think the hardened debian team is also going at selinux, but they're after bringing SSP, PaX, GrSecurity, etc as well.
2005-04-04T14:48:00.000Z	punkrockguy318	bluefoxicy	speaking of ubuntu security.. i was somewhat disappointed  to find that ubuntu is copmletely vulnerable to a fork bomb...
2005-04-04T14:49:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	punkrockguy318	 everyone is completely vulnerable to a fork bomb.  Edit /etc/security/limits.conf to have a line "*               hard    nproc           2048"
2005-04-04T14:49:00.000Z	punkrockguy318	bluefoxicy	debian isn't by default...
2005-04-04T14:50:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	punkrockguy318	 what stops debian from being fragged by a fork bomb
2005-04-04T14:50:00.000Z	punkrockguy318	bluefoxicy	different kernel options according to /.
2005-04-04T14:51:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	punkrockguy318	 there's no fork bomb defuser in the kernel by default
2005-04-04T14:52:00.000Z	punkrockguy318	bluefoxicy	why doesn't ubuntu set these limits by default?
2005-04-04T14:52:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	punkrockguy318	 I dunno
2005-04-04T14:52:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	punkrockguy318	 I haven't really tested them though. . .
2005-04-04T14:54:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	punkrockguy318	 hey it works.
2005-04-04T14:54:00.000Z	punkrockguy318	bluefoxicy	somoene should file a bug report
2005-04-04T14:54:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	punkrockguy318	 Actually i filed a report to make a security center, which was spawned by me looking at bastille's shitty ass UI, which was wehre I found that hack.
2005-04-04T14:56:00.000Z	punkrockguy318	bluefoxicy	hmm
