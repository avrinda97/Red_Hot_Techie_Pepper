2006-11-06T13:52:00.000Z	morphix		hi, due to some issues with the current ubuntu kernel i was forced to compile my own custom 2.6.18.1 kernel, but now nvidia drivers do not work.. and i'm unable to get into X
2006-11-06T13:52:00.000Z	mitrovarr	morphix	 you'll have to get the Nvidia drivers from Nvidia and compile them yourself
2006-11-06T13:53:00.000Z	mitrovarr	morphix	 check to make sure it's compiling with the same GCC version as the kernel
2006-11-06T13:56:00.000Z	mitrovarr	morphix	 I'd actually go to nvidia.com, get their driver package, and run their installer
2006-11-06T13:57:00.000Z	morphix	mitrovarr	well i'm kinda limit by the fact i cant load X to use a web browser.
2006-11-06T13:57:00.000Z	mitrovarr	morphix	 have someone get the web address and then use wget
2006-11-06T13:58:00.000Z	mitrovarr	morphix	 Do you have internet access at least?
2006-11-06T13:58:00.000Z	morphix	mitrovarr	i'm currently on the machine.. so yes. i have web access just no X
2006-11-06T13:58:00.000Z	mitrovarr	morphix	 32bit or 64bit linux?
2006-11-06T13:59:00.000Z	mitrovarr	morphix	 I think 'wget http://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/1.0-8776/NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-8776-pkg1.run' should work
2006-11-06T13:59:00.000Z	mitrovarr	morphix	 sorry you can't use copy and paste :-(
2006-11-06T14:01:00.000Z	mitrovarr	morphix	 using the nv driver is a good idea too.  Then, you can use x to get and install the driver
2006-11-06T14:02:00.000Z	morphix	mitrovarr	my X is currently set up for dual screen.. i'd have to generate a new xorg.conf just to use nv drivers
2006-11-06T14:02:00.000Z	mitrovarr	morphix	 well, you could just dupe the current file and use an interim one.
2006-11-06T14:02:00.000Z	mitrovarr	morphix	 but if you really don't wanna use x, did you try to get that file the way I suggested?
2006-11-06T14:03:00.000Z	mitrovarr	morphix	 it's the same thing, the driver from nvidia compiles itself for your kernle
2006-11-06T14:03:00.000Z	morphix	mitrovarr	yeh manually typed out the url (eek) and its downloading atm
2006-11-06T14:03:00.000Z	mitrovarr	morphix	 that's why I mentioned making sure you had the right GCC, sometimes the module is a pain
2006-11-06T14:06:00.000Z	morphix	mitrovarr	what was the *-dev packages i needed apart from xorg-dev ? there were a few errors during the installation
2006-11-06T14:07:00.000Z	mitrovarr	morphix	 I don't know, sorry.  You need build-essentials to make the module, I'm sure
2006-11-06T14:07:00.000Z	mitrovarr	morphix	 It takes a little bit of work to make the module-compiler work.  It's a pain.  I wish I remembered how, but I don't think there's any other way to make it work than to do it this way.
