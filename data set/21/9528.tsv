2005-10-02T10:59:00.000Z	vbgunz		is there anyway to encrypt the Ubuntu partition?
2005-10-02T11:01:00.000Z	vbgunz		foampeace... i don't live in heaven although I wish I did... if someone broke into my house and stole my PCs i wouldn't want then getting into my information... Just curious as I use to encrypt my whole disk with PGP desktop 9 but am trying to get away from that... Any alternatives for Ubuntu?
2005-10-02T11:03:00.000Z	vbgunz		ever...
2005-10-02T11:05:00.000Z	vbgunz		rop_p I have thousands of accounts on my PC... I don't need them falling into the wrong hands ever... you can and the world can say whatever they want... Is there a way to encrypt the information so no one could ever access it but me?
2005-10-02T11:07:00.000Z	vbgunz		I just thought I ask... I just don't know where to begin and thought Linux being so security savvy would have an option like that built in... I just thought I ask...
2005-10-02T11:07:00.000Z	JDahl	vbgunz	maybe you should look at filesystems/fileservers with encryption (e.g., openAFS)
2005-10-02T11:08:00.000Z	JDahl	vbgunz	but a word of caution: it's going to take a long time to setup and understand
2005-10-02T11:09:00.000Z	vbgunz	JDahl	thanks but can I still use Breezy with those File systems?
2005-10-02T11:09:00.000Z	JDahl	vbgunz	yes
2005-10-02T11:10:00.000Z	vbgunz	JDahl	I assume you mentioning it wouldn't be easy... I am guessing, it is not like setting up EXT3?
2005-10-02T11:11:00.000Z	JDahl	vbgunz	not all... it's a fileserver you install on your machine; whether you have ext2, ext3, vfat32 or whatever doesnt matter
2005-10-02T11:12:00.000Z	vbgunz	JDahl	oh ok, thank you... I will look into all options as soon as I have migrated over completely... I should be doing it before hand but thought now be a good time to start looking into it...
2005-10-10T10:55:00.000Z	JDahl	vbgunz	mp3 and ogg
2005-10-10T10:55:00.000Z	JDahl	vbgunz	no
2005-10-10T10:55:00.000Z	vbgunz	JDahl	out of the box what does Ubuntu support?
2005-10-10T10:56:00.000Z	JDahl	vbgunz	ogg, but it's easy to get mp3 support by installing gstreamer0.8-xxx
2005-10-10T10:56:00.000Z	JDahl	vbgunz	you dont need backports, but I think you need restricted for mp3
2005-10-10T10:57:00.000Z	vbgunz	JDahl	yeah, sorry, I mean, I don't wish to use unsupported or restricted formats so ogg is best?
2005-10-10T10:58:00.000Z	JDahl	vbgunz	I would think so, but restricted is not of lesser quality than the ordinary repository... it's just separated for legal reasons
2005-10-10T10:59:00.000Z	vbgunz	JDahl	I need to do some more reading though I remember I opened up some links in my apt file and Ubuntu started to act funny... Now I just wish to keep Ubuntu as clean and as supported as posible
2005-10-10T11:01:00.000Z	JDahl	vbgunz	that's a good idea.. stick with regular repositories and you wont break anything
