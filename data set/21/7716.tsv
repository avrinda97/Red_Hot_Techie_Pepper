2007-01-04T11:45:00.000Z	X|Rolando		Howdy folks, I'm having some trouble with samba between ubuntu edgy and windows xp. I have them connected via cat6s and a gigabit switch and if I browse, send & recieve files using the windows machine it works ok
2007-01-04T11:46:00.000Z	X|Rolando		but when I use ubuntu to browse files on the windows machine, it goes via the internet rather than just the switch
2007-01-04T11:46:00.000Z	Zaggynl	X|Rolando	how do you know it goes via the internet?
2007-01-04T11:46:00.000Z	X|Rolando	Zaggynl	it slows down to roughly my upload speed :P
2007-01-04T11:47:00.000Z	X|Rolando		which is 1.5-3 Mbps
2007-01-04T11:47:00.000Z	Zaggynl	X|Rolando	ah, that's a good one
2007-01-04T11:47:00.000Z	X|Rolando	Zaggynl	common problem or are you kidding? ;P
2007-01-04T11:47:00.000Z	Zaggynl	X|Rolando	you tried connecting on LAN address? (assuming you're working on a LAN)
2007-01-04T11:48:00.000Z	X|Rolando	Zaggynl	the thing is they both have individual IPs (External ones)
2007-01-04T11:48:00.000Z	Zaggynl	X|Rolando	but they are on the same LAN?
2007-01-04T11:48:00.000Z	X|Rolando	Zaggynl	same physical network
2007-01-04T11:48:00.000Z	Zaggynl	X|Rolando	you could try to put them in the same subnet
2007-01-04T11:49:00.000Z	X|Rolando	Zaggynl	what does that mean?
2007-01-04T11:50:00.000Z	Zaggynl	X|Rolando	Well, for example: if computer A has the LAN address 192.168.2.1, you could give computer B 192.168.2.2
2007-01-04T11:50:00.000Z	Zaggynl	X|Rolando	Assuming both addresses are not in use yet
2007-01-04T11:50:00.000Z	X|Rolando	Zaggynl	I see what you mean
2007-01-04T11:51:00.000Z	X|Rolando	Zaggynl	Unfortunately I play games alot on one and host servers on the other and I would hate to not be able to connect to them easily
2007-01-04T11:51:00.000Z	X|Rolando	Zaggynl	do you think two nics would be an option?
2007-01-04T11:52:00.000Z	Zaggynl	X|Rolando	Shouldn't be a problem, just make sure you have the ports forwarded to it's new address on the gaming PC
2007-01-04T11:55:00.000Z	X|Rolando	Zaggynl	thanks for the info, I'll ponder over my options :P
2007-01-04T11:55:00.000Z	Zaggynl	X|Rolando	You're welcome, happy pondering ;)
