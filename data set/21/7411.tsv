2006-10-26T09:26:00.000Z	Amaranth	Mirro	Oh, you want to do 'sudo apt-get dist-upgrade'
2006-10-26T09:26:00.000Z	Amaranth	Mirro	not upgrade
2006-10-26T09:29:00.000Z	Amaranth	Mirro	Run this: gksudo "update-manager -c"
2006-10-26T09:29:00.000Z	Amaranth	Mirro	hit alt-f2, copy and paste that into the dialog that comes up
2006-10-26T09:31:00.000Z	Mirro	Amaranth	i dunno what to type in :) what i tryed from https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EdgyUpgrades didnt work
2006-10-26T09:31:00.000Z	Amaranth	Mirro	I told you what to type in
2006-10-26T09:32:00.000Z	Amaranth	Mirro	Press Alt-F2, put `gksudo "update-manager -c"` in the box that comes up
2006-10-26T09:33:00.000Z	Mirro	Amaranth	dooglus, it says it cannot install all available updates, and tells me to "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade"
2006-10-26T09:33:00.000Z	Amaranth	Mirro	Alright. Open a terminal (Applications->Accessories->Terminal) and run 'sudo apt-get dist-upgrade'
2006-10-26T09:34:00.000Z	Amaranth	Mirro	Is that doing anything?
2006-10-26T09:36:00.000Z	Mirro	Amaranth	the same it did last time, mb it will work now...
2006-10-26T09:36:00.000Z	Amaranth	Mirro	Do it. :)
2006-10-26T09:37:00.000Z	Mirro	Amaranth	will it take long? will those 686MB/697MB be downloaded now?
2006-10-26T09:37:00.000Z	Amaranth	Mirro	Yeah, they'll start downloading now
2006-10-26T09:37:00.000Z	Amaranth	Mirro	what kind of internet connection do you have?
2006-10-26T09:38:00.000Z	Mirro	Amaranth	cuz my traffic sux, its DSL, but connects with 20-80kb/s
2006-10-26T09:40:00.000Z	Amaranth	Mirro	It'll probably take about an hour or two to install after it's done downloading. :P
