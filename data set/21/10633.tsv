2005-02-04T09:27:00.000Z	madsen		Ok, got a SiS gfx card and problems with DRI. Does _anyone_ know _anything_ related to that?
2005-02-04T09:27:00.000Z	trey3	madsen	what card?
2005-02-04T09:28:00.000Z	madsen	trey3	Hang on a sec...
2005-02-04T09:28:00.000Z	madsen	trey3	Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS]  65x/M650/740 PCI/AGP VGA Display Adapter
2005-02-04T09:28:00.000Z	trey3	madsen	I used to have a 630 ... no DRI support for that... no idea with 740 though
2005-02-04T09:29:00.000Z	madsen	trey3	Hmm... So... No hope for anything OpenGL?
2005-02-04T09:30:00.000Z	madsen	trey3	No GL screensavers work here and TuxRacer is pure lag. :/
2005-02-04T09:31:00.000Z	madsen	trey3	However, glxgears reports "935 frames in 5.0 seconds = 187.000 FPS"
2005-02-04T09:33:00.000Z	madsen	trey3	Hmm, you got any suggestions? Shouldn't the GL screensavers work?
2005-02-04T09:38:00.000Z	trey3	madsen	bother daniels, eventually he will answer  ;)
2005-02-04T09:39:00.000Z	madsen	trey3	Ok... :)
2005-02-04T10:44:00.000Z	madsen	trey3	lol
2005-02-04T10:49:00.000Z	trey3	madsen	try plugin the speakers into CDROM itself  ;)
2005-02-04T10:49:00.000Z	madsen	trey3	Hehe
2005-02-04T10:50:00.000Z	trey3	madsen	heh... no really... I've had alsa figure it out before... but without a cable connecting cdrom to sound, thats the easiest way...
2005-02-04T10:51:00.000Z	madsen	trey3	Did you just support my claim or...?
2005-02-04T10:51:00.000Z	trey3	madsen	via some players you don't (WMP comes to mind... and I believe even kscd) but gnome-cd won't "bridge" that...
2005-02-04T10:51:00.000Z	trey3	madsen	depends, what was your claim?
2005-02-04T10:52:00.000Z	madsen	trey3	Exactly what you just said. :)
2005-02-04T10:52:00.000Z	trey3	madsen	oh... then I guess I did  8)
2005-02-04T10:53:00.000Z	madsen	trey3	Second! :)
