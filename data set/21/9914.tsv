2005-07-16T07:33:00.000Z	mosty		bigbootay, it's called a "url"
2005-07-16T07:34:00.000Z	mosty		bigbootay, ie there is no special name
2005-07-16T07:34:00.000Z	bigfoot1	mosty	no, there's a more technical sounding term for it, but i forgot.
2005-07-16T07:38:00.000Z	mosty	bigfoot1	they both look like regular url's to me
2005-07-16T07:38:00.000Z	bigfoot1	mosty	but the google one is decipherable. It's not just numbers and letters. But the guardster one is just a string of numbers and letters. Do you see what I mean?
2005-07-16T07:41:00.000Z	mosty	bigfoot1	i don't think there is an official term that differentiates between your two cases
2005-07-16T07:42:00.000Z	mosty	bigfoot1	perhaps "human readable" ?
2005-07-16T07:43:00.000Z	bigfoot1	mosty	i guess that would do. I ask because I don't know how to make Smart URLs in Galeon for those sites that make non-human-readable urls.
2005-07-16T07:43:00.000Z	mosty	bigfoot1	use that tinyurl website?
2005-07-16T07:44:00.000Z	bigfoot1	mosty	no, i'm not looking to making a url shorter.
2005-07-16T07:44:00.000Z	mosty	bigfoot1	this is a job for the web developer, not the web browser, methinks
2005-07-16T07:45:00.000Z	bigfoot1	mosty	maybe. but i beg to differ: Firefox offers this function. Just right click on an empty search box in a website and Voila. You have a smart search. But it's a bit harder with Galeon. Hope you see what i mean.
2005-07-16T07:46:00.000Z	mosty	bigfoot1	i don't understand the feature you're describing...
2005-07-16T07:52:00.000Z	bigfoot1	mosty	i don't know what Firefox calls it, but do this and you'll understand: in firefox address bar, enter "google" then a search term.
2005-07-16T07:54:00.000Z	mosty	bigfoot1	that sends me to a random website (based on a dns lookup of whatever crap i typed)
2005-07-16T07:54:00.000Z	bigfoot1	mosty	i remembered: in Fx, it's called "Quick Search"
2005-07-16T07:56:00.000Z	mosty	bigfoot1	that's not a standard firefox feature, must be a plugin
2005-07-16T07:56:00.000Z	bigfoot1	mosty	check out your bookmars folders for a folder called "quick search". then check out one bookmark's popretries.
2005-07-16T07:56:00.000Z	bigfoot1	mosty	no. not a plugin. it's standard.
2005-07-16T07:56:00.000Z	mosty	bigfoot1	i have no "quick search" folder in my bookmarks
2005-07-16T07:57:00.000Z	bigfoot1	mosty	ok. let's just forget it.
