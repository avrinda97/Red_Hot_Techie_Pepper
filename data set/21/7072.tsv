2006-12-06T14:40:00.000Z	lumar		 question: when using synaptic i go to install nvidia-settings, it then puts nvidia-glx (which ive already installed) under 'to be removed' . but all guuides talk about installing both
2006-12-06T14:40:00.000Z	lumar		and id like to install the nvidia-settings. but keep the glx
2006-12-06T14:40:00.000Z	lumar		it being my video driver
2006-12-06T14:40:00.000Z	nothlit	lumar	aptitude -s install nvidia-settings tell me the conflict message

2006-12-06T14:42:00.000Z	nothlit		if its less than three lines than its fine here
2006-12-06T14:42:00.000Z	lumar		ok wait, it basically said i need the legacy drivers
2006-12-06T14:42:00.000Z	lumar		the older ones
2006-12-06T14:43:00.000Z	lumar		but they arn't available in my synaptic pm, i downloaded them via aptitude just then using the line you gave me
2006-12-06T14:43:00.000Z	lumar		so thanks, ill see where i go from here..
2006-12-06T14:43:00.000Z	nothlit	lumar	if you're installing nvidia 1.0-9629 from an alternate place, you probably already have nvidia-settings installed
2006-12-06T14:43:00.000Z	nothlit	lumar	try nvidia-settings
