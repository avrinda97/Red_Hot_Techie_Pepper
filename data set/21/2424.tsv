2009-11-21T08:20:00.000Z	Monocian		May I ask a question? :-s
2009-11-21T08:20:00.000Z	Monocian		>.>
2009-11-21T08:21:00.000Z	Monocian		Just because i cant find the right question to place in the search section
2009-11-21T08:21:00.000Z	Magnesium	Monocian	Sorry, I don't follow you....
2009-11-21T08:21:00.000Z	Monocian		My problem is: (  a bit long): I got ubuntu 8.04 and it runs fine in live cd mode
2009-11-21T08:22:00.000Z	Monocian		But I've just downloaded Xubuntu 9.10 and a OpenSUSE 11.2 too. I burned both of them
2009-11-21T08:23:00.000Z	Monocian		But when I boot, they both cant run any mode ( live cd, install) and all say boot error
2009-11-21T08:24:00.000Z	Monocian		Xubuntu has a window say I/O error: Reboot
2009-11-21T08:24:00.000Z	Monocian		OpenSuse crash at loading screen
2009-11-21T08:24:00.000Z	Magnesium	Monocian	Almost sounds like the discs didn't burn right.
2009-11-21T08:24:00.000Z	Magnesium	Monocian	Especially the IO error part.
2009-11-21T08:25:00.000Z	Magnesium	Monocian	With Xubuntu, can you get to the screen where it shows all the languages?
2009-11-21T08:29:00.000Z	Monocian	Ironicus	I'm even at -1 :(
2009-11-21T08:30:00.000Z	Magnesium	Monocian	I don't know for sure why it wouldn't boot due to that error other than the fact that the disc was burned with an error.
2009-11-21T08:30:00.000Z	Magnesium	Monocian	I mean, that's kinda what I/O error means, the computer can't read from the disc.
2009-11-21T08:46:00.000Z	Monocian		Can we talk here about how to convince others to use ubuntu? :(
2009-11-21T11:56:00.000Z	Monocian		Can 1gb usb work to install ubuntu?
2009-11-21T12:23:00.000Z	Monocian		!vn
2009-11-21T13:15:00.000Z	Monocian		which is lighter, suse or xubuntu?
2009-11-22T08:41:00.000Z	Monocian		Can anyone tell me where to find Startup applications in Xubuntu ? :)
2009-11-22T09:16:00.000Z	Magnesium	Monocian	Hey Monocian, did you ever get your discs working?
