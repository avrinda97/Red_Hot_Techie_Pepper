2010-04-20T23:54:00.000Z	fedora-stuck		d33d.. tried that too! Unetbootin does not work with fedora...
2010-04-20T23:54:00.000Z	fedora-stuck		not always at least. And ofcourse not in my case :P
2010-04-20T23:54:00.000Z	fedora-stuck		The Fedora Project has received numerous bug reports relating to using Fedora Live USB keys made with unetbootin
2010-04-20T23:55:00.000Z	fedora-stuck		i tried sudo dd if=/media/1e7fcf74-f85d-4037-a5ea-0a76ab43ee22/home/jastonas/Downloads/Torrents/ubuntu-10.04-beta2-desktop-amd64.iso of=/dev/sdc1 bs=1M  and going to check it now
2010-04-20T23:55:00.000Z	d33d	fedora-stuck	they are on Fedora Project https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/search/unetbootin you need to use unetbootin - to run Ubuntu. NOT fedora. It works but it means, you cannot use it to run a Fedora Live USB.
2010-04-20T23:55:00.000Z	fedora-stuck		you think that will do? Do i need to do anything  else besides dd if=....
2010-04-20T23:56:00.000Z	fedora-stuck		d33d
