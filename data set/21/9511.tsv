2007-12-12T11:21:00.000Z	evanotten		** I am a noob and really in need of help, I don't mean to burden some of you veterans but I could really use some assistance.  Anyone willing to help me would be greatly appreciated
2007-12-12T11:22:00.000Z	evanotten		i just went through the installation of the cd trying to dual boot from xp and i get the error loading operator message when i try to boot xp without a disk
2007-12-12T11:22:00.000Z	evanotten		i am not sure where to start resolving this issue after looking things up the answer doesnt seem clear beyond reformatting
2007-12-12T11:23:00.000Z	arash	evanotten	, so you started with a XP on your computer and then installed Ubuntu?
2007-12-12T11:24:00.000Z	arash	evanotten	: when you turn on your computer, does it ask which one you want to boot?
2007-12-12T11:25:00.000Z	arash	evanotten	: hmm, might it be your formated over the whole WinXP system? how many partitions do you have now? you should have at least 1 NTFS 1 ext3 (most likely)
2007-12-12T11:26:00.000Z	arash	evanotten	: hmm, are you sure your WinXP still exists on your computer?
2007-12-12T11:27:00.000Z	arash	evanotten	: so the windows folder is till around right?
2007-12-12T11:29:00.000Z	arash	evanotten	I think the problem lies around here, but I can't say more precisely
2007-12-12T11:43:00.000Z	arash	evanotten	. like merging them?
2007-12-12T11:44:00.000Z	arash	evanotten	just to be sure, you have to ext3 partitions you want to one, one of them contains a failed Ubuntu installtion and other one contains your current working one?
2007-12-12T11:45:00.000Z	arash	evanotten	: Yes, it's easy if you got the live CD (can be old)
2007-12-12T11:46:00.000Z	arash	evanotten	: OK, still wanna know how to merge the partitions?
2007-12-12T11:48:00.000Z	arash	evanotten	boot from the LIVE CD, so you have a Live CD session, go to system - administration - GNOME partition Editor, purge/remove the failed partition, then extend/resize the other partition so it covers the area that recently was covered by not working partition
2007-12-12T11:49:00.000Z	arash	evanotten	: no need to touch the terminal :)
2007-12-12T11:52:00.000Z	arash	evanotten	Im not allowed to mention this (Ubuntu policy, the program can crash badly), but since you got recent isntalltion, try out ENVY (IF NOTHING ELSE WORKS),, it can save you days spend of times finding the problem
2007-12-12T11:54:00.000Z	arash	evanotten	: have it as resource if guides are a headache, 'a last resort', but it's great, also be awaer of if you use 7.10, check system-administration - restricted drivers administration
2007-12-12T11:58:00.000Z	arash	evanotten	: I like KDE, but my Kubuntu 7.10 CD didnt work, so I got Ubunt -.- . , be aware that you do not nede to install Kubuntu to try our KDE session on Ubuntu, it's easy to install and try!
2007-12-12T11:59:00.000Z	arash	evanotten	count with a headache if you go for KDE+compiz though
2007-12-12T12:01:00.000Z	arash	evanotten	yea, as astro said, and I can say from own experience that running compiz on KDE is more troublesome than compiz on GNOME
