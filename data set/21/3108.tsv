2009-09-10T09:49:00.000Z	nephlim		hey guys
2009-09-10T09:50:00.000Z	nephlim		upgrading from ibex to jaunty, old hard drive to new harddrive. I want to encrypt the new drive, then just CP home and root. is there anything I should know to make this go smoothly?
2009-09-10T09:51:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	nephlim	You probably want to use Ubuntu Alternative ISO to make encrypted system.
2009-09-10T09:51:00.000Z	nephlim	mobi-sheep	right, got that
2009-09-10T09:52:00.000Z	nephlim	mobi-sheep	I was going to format, encrypt and partition the new, boot via old, and cp old to new, and install the MBR on new. that should work right?
2009-09-10T09:52:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	nephlim	Backing up home directory should be enough.  However, if you wish to backup your /root -- Feel free to do so (in case something breaks).
2009-09-10T09:53:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	nephlim	You can't have both hard drives plugged in?
2009-09-10T09:54:00.000Z	nephlim	mobi-sheep	I can. I just want to take all my settings like smb.conf and what not, and all of home, and put it on a new, encrypted, bigger, drive
2009-09-10T09:56:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	nephlim	You should be able to install new encrypted system on new hard drive.  Later, you mount and CP the home partition to the new partition.
2009-09-10T09:56:00.000Z	nephlim	mobi-sheep	ok cool. sounds like I had the right idea
2009-09-10T09:57:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	nephlim	Make sure GDM or anything else is not running.  Do it in tty.
2009-09-10T09:58:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	nephlim	Basically, you want to do it on tty... but if you don't know tty, use liveCD. I suppose.
2009-09-10T09:59:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	nephlim	It's a terminal.  Really.
2009-09-10T09:59:00.000Z	nephlim	mobi-sheep	oh, that's easy enough
2009-09-10T10:01:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	nephlim	I tend to avoid upgrade. I always do a clean install every new release. :)
2009-09-10T10:01:00.000Z	nephlim	mobi-sheep	that must make for lots of backups
2009-09-10T10:02:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	nephlim	Not really. The only thing I keep is /home and occasionally few other things. I have 2TB HDD so I'm not concerned about storages. :)
2009-09-10T10:03:00.000Z	nephlim	mobi-sheep	what about custom .configs for samba or apache or conky?
2009-09-10T10:04:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	nephlim	I don't use conky, samba, or apache frequently.  Sometimes you can place them in your home directory... Read manuals for that.
2009-09-10T11:22:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	nephlim	There are (automated) guided encryption option, I believe.
2009-09-10T11:28:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	nephlim	Use guided encryption system.  It'll set up everything for you.  It's your first time. Let it deal with it so you can see how it is... and if you're satisfied with it.  It does the job. Simple as that.
