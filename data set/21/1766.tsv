2010-07-07T09:40:00.000Z	_jesse_		I'm having some trouble getting apache2-dev installed, I get the error apache2-threaded-dev: Depends: libaprutil1-dev but it is not going to be installed
2010-07-07T09:41:00.000Z	un214	_jesse_	trying to install the one that says "not going to be installed" always yields the real error
2010-07-07T09:42:00.000Z	_jesse_	un214	yeah it's a chain 'not going to be installed' until I get to libsqlite3-dev where I get: libsqlite3-dev: Depends: libsqlite3-0 (= 3.6.22-1) but 3.6.23.1-2 is to be installed
2010-07-07T09:44:00.000Z	_jesse_	un214	yeah was going to, but nearly 100 programs depend on it
2010-07-07T09:45:00.000Z	un214	_jesse_	my best recommendation is to build sqlite3 from source and install it
2010-07-07T09:46:00.000Z	_jesse_	un214	scratch that, 438 to remove (2 GB)
2010-07-07T09:46:00.000Z	_jesse_	un214	I try compiling it myself
2010-07-07T09:47:00.000Z	un214	_jesse_	once installed local version, you should be able to force dpkg to know its installed using equivs
2010-07-07T09:51:00.000Z	_jesse_	un214	alright, compiled and installed the latest version, what is the next step to mk dpkg see it?
2010-07-07T09:52:00.000Z	_jesse_	un214	you lost me there, I'll look at the docs
2010-07-07T10:00:00.000Z	_jesse_	un214	still isn't working, I created the equivs file, should I set the version number to what libsqlite3-dev is looking for?
2010-07-07T10:00:00.000Z	un214	_jesse_	yes
2010-07-07T10:00:00.000Z	_jesse_	un214	alright
2010-07-07T10:01:00.000Z	_jesse_	un214	ah, well apache2 is still complaining
2010-07-07T10:04:00.000Z	_jesse_	un214	you are a genius :) should I know anything down the line though? i.e. will it update properly etc.
2010-07-07T10:05:00.000Z	un214	_jesse_	no
2010-07-07T10:05:00.000Z	_jesse_	un214	blah figured that was too much to hope for
2010-07-07T10:05:00.000Z	_jesse_	un214	will I need to rebuild it then?
2010-07-07T10:06:00.000Z	un214	_jesse_	if they haven't fixed it by then I don't know if a rebuild will work anymore
2010-07-07T10:07:00.000Z	_jesse_	un214	so what should I look out for/do?
2010-07-07T10:08:00.000Z	_jesse_	un214	one of the apache devs?
