2011-02-07T17:24:00.000Z	Fallen_Demon		?
2011-02-07T17:26:00.000Z	juk	Fallen_Demon	download iso and write to pendrive, there's web site dedicated to that penrivelinux.org
2011-02-07T17:26:00.000Z	Fallen_Demon	juk	tried Unetbootin
2011-02-07T17:26:00.000Z	Fallen_Demon		Doesn't work
2011-02-07T17:27:00.000Z	Fallen_Demon		Can't find USB creator anywhere online for me to try and compile -.-
2011-02-07T17:27:00.000Z	Fallen_Demon		Thinking I need to bring up a live CD
2011-02-07T17:28:00.000Z	juk	Fallen_Demon	is there only Unetbootin way in tutorial?
2011-02-07T17:28:00.000Z	Fallen_Demon		Just had an idea, I think I'm running 10.04 on my netbook
2011-02-07T17:28:00.000Z	Fallen_Demon		I'll copy it across
2011-02-07T17:29:00.000Z	juk	Fallen_Demon	also possible reason might be incompatible bios/usb

2011-02-07T17:33:00.000Z	Fallen_Demon		unetbootin just doesn't like maverick
2011-02-07T17:35:00.000Z	juk	Fallen_Demon	might be too, grub issue then, they updated it i think
2011-02-07T17:37:00.000Z	Fallen_Demon	juk	I remembered I had lucid installed on netbook
2011-02-07T17:37:00.000Z	Fallen_Demon		Have just copied everything across and installed the usb-creator package
2011-02-07T17:37:00.000Z	Fallen_Demon		Should work now, thanks
