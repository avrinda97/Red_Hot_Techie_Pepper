2011-10-19T06:57:00.000Z	Gskellig		anyone?
2011-10-19T06:58:00.000Z	Gskellig		mouse is giant in firefox, normal in xchat, except when i go to click on a link or type in a box, then it gets giant again
2011-10-19T06:58:00.000Z	cajunspice	Gskellig	isn't there a desktop setting that makes the cursor grow when moved?
2011-10-19T06:59:00.000Z	Gskellig	cajunspice	I don't know, but that doesn't sound like my problem
2011-10-19T07:06:00.000Z	cajunspice	Gskellig	from your description, it's not random, it's being done to the cursor by the apps you're running
2011-10-19T07:07:00.000Z	Gskellig	cajunspice	i think its the cursor... Multiple apps have similar problems
2011-10-19T07:32:00.000Z	cajunspice	Gskellig	which window manager are you using?
2011-10-19T07:32:00.000Z	Gskellig	cajunspice	unity. I installed 11.10 like an hour ago. Vanilla everything, just xchat
2011-10-19T07:35:00.000Z	cajunspice	Gskellig	there should be an accessibility tab
2011-10-19T07:35:00.000Z	Gskellig	cajunspice	the accessibility tab doesn't have anything about cursors though
2011-10-19T07:37:00.000Z	cajunspice	Gskellig	if you look for the cursor themes settings, that might do it
2011-10-19T07:40:00.000Z	cajunspice	Gskellig	http://tombuntu.com/index.php/2008/05/19/how-to-install-cursor-themes/
2011-10-19T07:42:00.000Z	cajunspice	Gskellig	the directions also include how to set your cursor theme to one you already have installed
2011-10-19T08:01:00.000Z	Gskellig	cajunspice	the link you sent me doesn't work for 11.10
2011-10-19T08:17:00.000Z	cajunspice	Gskellig	what's your screen resolution?
2011-10-19T08:18:00.000Z	cajunspice	Gskellig	I don't know
2011-10-19T08:19:00.000Z	cajunspice	Gskellig	what kind of video card do you have?
2011-10-19T08:20:00.000Z	cajunspice	Gskellig	what video driver does it say it's using?
2011-10-19T08:23:00.000Z	Gskellig	cajunspice	its more than just drivers, in order to get it working correctly I need to disable one graphics card
2011-10-19T08:23:00.000Z	cajunspice	Gskellig	there is a file "/etc/X11/xorg.conf" which tells it which driver to use
2011-10-19T08:26:00.000Z	cajunspice	Gskellig	if you were setup to use the VESA driver, it draws the mouse cursor(s) in software, so one less thing to go wrong
