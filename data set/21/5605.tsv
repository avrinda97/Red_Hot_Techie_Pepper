2007-09-16T06:28:00.000Z	elzo		anybody know how to change ownership of files/directory of NTFS drive, without going through Windows XP?  i.e. straight from ubuntu
2007-09-16T06:28:00.000Z	EbilPhish	elzo	 I don't think thats possible from Linux
2007-09-16T06:56:00.000Z	EbilPhish	elzo	 I don't think there is a driver under linux that can understand windows acls
2007-09-16T06:59:00.000Z	EbilPhish	elzo	 You shouldn't need acls if your just backing up the files unless you also want to backup the acls info itself
2007-09-16T06:59:00.000Z	EbilPhish	elzo	 If your getting permission problems make sure your root
2007-09-16T07:01:00.000Z	EbilPhish	elzo	 Can you open the files, 'cat /path/to/files/randomfile.doc'
2007-09-16T07:03:00.000Z	EbilPhish	elzo	 Check what the actual permissions show as on the file in ls
2007-09-16T07:06:00.000Z	EbilPhish	elzo	 That very odd, if you mounted with -t ntfs then it should be using the very basic ntfs, might be worth trying ntfs-3g again with the force option
2007-09-16T07:06:00.000Z	EbilPhish	elzo	 Also if you have a windows cd you might beable to use that to get to the recovery console
2007-09-16T07:07:00.000Z	elzo	EbilPhish	Okay, I'll try and apt-get ntfs-3g while using the LiveCD.  I can't get into the recovery console either way because I don't have the notebook's administrator password for the C:/
2007-09-16T07:08:00.000Z	elzo	EbilPhish	so ntfs-3g is not by default on feisty?  Feisty's ntfs driver is basic huh?
2007-09-16T07:08:00.000Z	EbilPhish	elzo	 Its possible the files are somehow encrypted, that might be a pain
2007-09-16T07:09:00.000Z	EbilPhish	elzo	 The ntfs-config package uses ntfs-3g with fuse but its a pain when the drives arn't clean, ntfs is built into the kernel but is read only
2007-09-16T07:09:00.000Z	elzo	EbilPhish	yup if it's encrypted then I'll forget it.  :)  But she just wants a copy somewhere first before her company help desk fixes.. she doesn't trust them or something ;)
2007-09-16T07:09:00.000Z	EbilPhish	elzo	 If you only need 1 or 2 files then you might beable to use a foresic recovery program like autopsy
2007-09-16T07:10:00.000Z	elzo	EbilPhish	so no point getting ntfs-3g right?
2007-09-16T07:10:00.000Z	elzo	EbilPhish	if the live cd already have it
2007-09-16T07:10:00.000Z	elzo	EbilPhish	i tried -t ntfs-3g and it says, type unknown
2007-09-16T07:10:00.000Z	EbilPhish	elzo	 If you got ntfs-config then you probally have ntfs3g already
2007-09-16T07:11:00.000Z	EbilPhish	elzo	 hmm maybe it is seperate, try apt-get ntfs-3g then
2007-09-16T07:11:00.000Z	EbilPhish	elzo	 ah yeh, and apt-get update
