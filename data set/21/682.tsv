2011-07-30T14:50:00.000Z	zendeavor		hey guys, having a bit of an issue with a bitlbee daemon. i've installed bitlbee 3.0.3 dev version from their repos, and when i start the bitlbee daemon `/etc/init.d/bitlbee start` it is the old 3.0.1 version
2011-07-30T14:51:00.000Z	wols	zendeavor	and the old version was installed how?
2011-07-30T14:52:00.000Z	wols	zendeavor	answer my question
2011-07-30T14:52:00.000Z	zendeavor	wols	i did. apt-get.
2011-07-30T14:52:00.000Z	wols	zendeavor	dpkg -l |grep bitlb
2011-07-30T14:52:00.000Z	zendeavor	wols	ii  bitlbee                              3.0.3+devel+802-1                          An IRC to other chat networks gateway (default version)
2011-07-30T14:56:00.000Z	wols	zendeavor	find / -name bitlbee |grep bin
2011-07-30T14:56:00.000Z	wols	zendeavor	I think the binary is nammed "bitlbee", adjust if it's not
2011-07-30T14:59:00.000Z	zendeavor	wols	/usr/sbin/bitlbee
2011-07-30T15:00:00.000Z	wols	zendeavor	and this is the only one? and if you run it, what version is it?
2011-07-30T15:01:00.000Z	zendeavor	wols	it warns me that i probably started bitlbee like that by accident :)
2011-07-30T15:01:00.000Z	wols	zendeavor	bitlbee -v or bitlbee --version, etc?
2011-07-30T15:02:00.000Z	zendeavor	wols	trying various combinations of flags from manpage to get an output
2011-07-30T15:04:00.000Z	zendeavor	wols	if i start it from cli like this, i have to use -D -n -v to cause bitlbee to start in daemon mode, not fork to background, and be verbose. but there is no output even with this
2011-07-30T15:04:00.000Z	wols	zendeavor	how do you know that it's 3.0.1 and not 3.03 when starting normally?
2011-07-30T15:05:00.000Z	zendeavor	wols	in bitlbee control channel "/ctcp root version"
2011-07-30T15:05:00.000Z	zendeavor	wols	CTCP reply from root: VERSION BitlBee 3.0.1-1build1 Linux/x86_64
2011-07-30T15:05:00.000Z	wols	zendeavor	then start it as you described above and query it via ctcp again?
2011-07-30T15:07:00.000Z	zendeavor	wols	no change still
2011-07-30T15:08:00.000Z	wols	zendeavor	md5sum your bitlbee binary. record the md5 hash. then purge all bitlbee packages. check that /usr/sbin/bitlbee does not exist. reinstall your developer bitlbee packages, do another md6sum on it and compare
2011-07-30T15:17:00.000Z	zendeavor	wols	thanks for talking it out with me. the init script for the daemon appeared to have a bug causing the process to not end when stop was called
