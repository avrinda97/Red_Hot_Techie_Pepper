2009-11-10T06:59:00.000Z	nnz		I'm with you codemaster
2009-11-10T06:59:00.000Z	coz_	nnz	  I think it is in the repository
2009-11-10T07:00:00.000Z	coz_	nnz	  open up system/administration/synapitc package manager
2009-11-10T07:00:00.000Z	coz_	nnz	  hit Search  type  thunderbird
2009-11-10T07:00:00.000Z	coz_	nnz	  you will see mozilla-thunderbiry  2.0.0.23
2009-11-10T07:02:00.000Z	coz_	nnz	 please dont do that :)
2009-11-10T07:02:00.000Z	coz_	nnz	   sudo apt-getinstall mozilla-thunderbird
2009-11-10T07:02:00.000Z	coz_	nnz	  sorry  sudo apt-get install mozilla-thunderbird
2009-11-10T07:08:00.000Z	coz_	nnz	  you could download the tar.gz file  extract that and read the  README  file as well as the INSTALL file for thunderbird
2009-11-10T07:11:00.000Z	coz_	nnz	  tell me slowly what it is you want to do with tunderbird ....why you dont want to use the package manager... and why you are insisting on compiling this?
2009-11-10T07:12:00.000Z	coz_	nnz	 let me download that and look hold on
2009-11-10T07:14:00.000Z	coz_	nnz	  I have thunderbird installed here    all I did was sudo apt-get install thunderbird
2009-11-10T07:14:00.000Z	coz_	nnz	 but let me look at the source package
2009-11-10T07:20:00.000Z	coz_	nnz	 in that extracted package is the mozilla-installer-bin
2009-11-10T07:21:00.000Z	coz_	nnz	  you run that in a terminal with   ./mozilla-installer-bin  but you will also need to install libstdc first and perhaps other dependencies all of which are taken care of withing the repository thunderbird
2009-11-10T07:39:00.000Z	coz_	nnz	  its not ubuntu it is the user     ubuntu is as powerful as  you make it
2009-11-10T07:40:00.000Z	coz_	nnz	 I think a couple deep breaths  might help to relax you :)
