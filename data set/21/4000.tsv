2008-08-02T19:38:00.000Z	clock2306		can anyone help me with ssh.. im going nuts here. no matter what i try its always the same thing client - ssh to server = asking for passw <-- and I dont knwo the passw = permission denied
2008-08-02T19:38:00.000Z	unop	clock2306	what username are you using?
2008-08-02T19:38:00.000Z	clock2306	unop	on the server? nothing I guess, i never created one
2008-08-02T19:39:00.000Z	unop	clock2306	so how do you expect to log on? :) you need a valid user on the server to be able to log on (ssh or otherwise)
2008-08-02T19:39:00.000Z	clock2306	unop	all the guies/tutorials i followed says the samething login to your remote, but everytime I do that, its always asking for a passwd, so i can never finish a tutorial, i cant get past the passw thing
2008-08-02T19:40:00.000Z	unop	clock2306	is this a server you setup?
2008-08-02T19:40:00.000Z	clock2306	unop	do you have a good guide i can use?
2008-08-02T19:40:00.000Z	clock2306	unop	im trying to ssh from my main os - kubuntu (client) into my guest os (vmare-gentoo)
2008-08-02T19:41:00.000Z	unop	clock2306	well, setup a user in the vmware-gentoo install and then use that user with ssh
2008-08-02T19:41:00.000Z	clock2306	unop	im not there yet, i have no userspace, im trying to compile gentoo from scratch, but i need to be able to ssh into gentoo so i can copy and paste
2008-08-02T19:42:00.000Z	clock2306	unop	any ideas or better a guide ?
2008-08-02T19:43:00.000Z	unop	clock2306	you've got a catch 22 then .. without a valid user, you can't log on .. has a root account been created on the gentoo install yet? i'm not very familiar with gentoo's phases, but i am pretty sure a root account is created on phase 1
2008-08-02T19:43:00.000Z	unop	clock2306	this is a gentoo issue you're asking about in #ubuntu -- you will have to ask someone who knows about gentoo .. in #gentoo perhaps ..
2008-08-02T19:44:00.000Z	clock2306	unop	but its not related to gentoo since i havent actually built gentoo
2008-08-02T19:44:00.000Z	clock2306	unop	im just a noob, i guess i have to read on
2008-08-02T19:44:00.000Z	unop	clock2306	it is a gentoo issue if you're trying to ssh into a partial build of gentoo ..
2008-08-02T19:44:00.000Z	clock2306	unop	oh okay
2008-08-02T19:45:00.000Z	clock2306	unop	thats too bad, because im not joining #gentoo, I did it once and ive never seen such hostility towards noobs
2008-08-02T19:45:00.000Z	clock2306	unop	thanks anyways
2008-08-02T19:45:00.000Z	unop	clock2306	i'm sorry we can't help here, we only support ubuntu
2008-08-02T19:46:00.000Z	clock2306	unop	no its my fault.. im using irssi and I actually thought I was in #linux but it turns out im on ubuntu, my apologies :)
