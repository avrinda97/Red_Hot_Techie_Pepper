2008-02-05T02:23:00.000Z	jetscreamer	roly2	assuming you downloaded the proper file that supports your gpu (aka the latest) and add sudo to whatever, and have all the other unmentioned requirements to compile stuff, yes
2008-02-05T02:27:00.000Z	jetscreamer	roly2	you have to read the whole thing and follow the directions
2008-02-05T02:27:00.000Z	jetscreamer	roly2	you have to download the file. you have to change things in the command if you need to. you need to add sudo.
2008-02-05T02:29:00.000Z	roly2	jetscreamer	can i private you please?
2008-02-05T02:30:00.000Z	jetscreamer	roly2	not atm, after i get off work maybe i can help you figure it out more
2008-02-05T02:31:00.000Z	jetscreamer	roly2	you said you had an 8400gt? just get the latest version, .09 . or you can just get the .07 if you really want.
2008-02-05T02:33:00.000Z	jetscreamer	roly2	any 8xxx, get the latest.. iirc it's the 169.09
2008-02-05T02:33:00.000Z	jetscreamer	roly2	did you read what it said?
2008-02-05T02:34:00.000Z	jetscreamer	roly2	just go to nvidia.com and d/l the latest linux version
2008-02-05T02:35:00.000Z	jetscreamer	roly2	then just change the .07 to .09 in the command, and add sudo in front of the apt-get and the sh NVIDIA
2008-02-05T02:36:00.000Z	jetscreamer	roly2	or just split the command line into it's two seperate command..  either side of the &&
