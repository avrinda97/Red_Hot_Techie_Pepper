2008-01-05T23:03:00.000Z	ikonia	ijn	why don't you ask the question
2008-01-05T23:05:00.000Z	ikonia	ijn	wicd doesn't appear to be in the ubuntu repo's
2008-01-05T23:05:00.000Z	ikonia	ijn	broadcase your network name
2008-01-05T23:05:00.000Z	ikonia	ijn	wicd doesn't appear to be in the ubuntu repo's where did you get it
2008-01-05T23:07:00.000Z	ikonia	ijn	I don't understand where you got wicd from as it's not in the repo
2008-01-05T23:08:00.000Z	ikonia	ijn	then this is nothing to do with ubuntu support as it's not an ubuntu packaged/supported product
2008-01-14T15:44:00.000Z	ikonia	ijn	did you try the restricted drivers package with ubuntu ?
2008-01-14T15:45:00.000Z	ikonia	ijn	any reason you changed ?
2008-01-14T15:45:00.000Z	ikonia	ijn	why ?
2008-01-14T15:45:00.000Z	ikonia	ijn	where you having problems with the other drivers ?
2008-01-14T15:48:00.000Z	ikonia	ijn	you can't
2008-01-14T15:48:00.000Z	ikonia	ijn	you've changed the drives for no reasons to unsupported versions now your complaining you want an example xorg.conf file
2008-01-14T15:49:00.000Z	ikonia	ijn	there are solid ati specialists in #ati
2008-01-19T00:50:00.000Z	ikonia	ijn	no it doesn't exist
2008-01-19T00:51:00.000Z	ikonia	ijn	you can't at the moment a.) the flash package is broke, 2.) the flash plugin is 32bit nativly and you have to use wrappers to use it
2008-01-19T00:52:00.000Z	ikonia	ijn	no, it's been broken for weeks, however even then it would still be native 32bit
