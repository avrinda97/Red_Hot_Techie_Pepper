2005-05-05T12:59:00.000Z	Delph		so... a few games have a linux installer.
2005-05-05T12:59:00.000Z	Delph		How many hardware manufacturers have linux drivers that work nicely.
2005-05-05T13:00:00.000Z	Delph		cedega doesn't count.
2005-05-05T13:00:00.000Z	Delph		it's to *work around* commerical vendors without support for linux.
2005-05-05T13:00:00.000Z	Delph		this is what I mean by 'total lack of support'
2005-05-05T13:00:00.000Z	^vir^	Delph	 ati have started to support linux
2005-05-05T13:01:00.000Z	Delph	^vir^	oh, the random binary lump that you have to hope works?
2005-05-05T13:06:00.000Z	^vir^	Delph	what you forget is consoles are becoming pcs now so a proper console system doesn't exist
2005-05-05T13:06:00.000Z	Delph	^vir^	yes. But they run operating systems that are designed for gaming. They're not operating systems designed for extensible configurablilty.
2005-05-05T13:08:00.000Z	^vir^	Delph	the xbox was designed to take the place of a console & yet it performs poorly & gta san andrios on the ps2 is bad aswell
2005-05-05T13:09:00.000Z	Delph	^vir^	uhh, yeah. But a bad example of an implementation is not sufficient to disprove a generalisation of an idea.
2005-05-05T13:11:00.000Z	^vir^	Delph	only consoles that are like consoles are the hand helds
2005-05-05T13:12:00.000Z	Delph	^vir^	Linux, Win2k, etc... are based on multi-user, multi-app kernels, that do lots of memory protection etc... A good gaming system, well designed, would run entirely in ring0, forgetting about protected mode context switch overheads, and whole big heaps of other related junk.
2005-05-05T13:13:00.000Z	^vir^	Delph	you just summed up a handheld basicaly
2005-05-05T13:13:00.000Z	Delph	^vir^	uhhm Yes.
2005-05-05T13:14:00.000Z	^vir^	Delph	lets face it the console market have tried stepping up to the pc market with things
2005-05-05T13:17:00.000Z	Delph	^vir^	and it's going to be hard to add in a properly configurable, abstracted, fast, extensible way support for all these gaming-related objects without the support of the manufacturers themselves.
2005-05-05T13:18:00.000Z	^vir^	Delph	as soon as linux becomes more of a desktop machine i'm sure companies will start supporting linux
2005-05-05T13:19:00.000Z	^vir^	Delph	tried e17 yet?
2005-05-05T13:23:00.000Z	Delph	^vir^	no; how many people support it =:)
2005-05-05T13:27:00.000Z	Delph	^vir^	I shall believe it when I see it =:)
