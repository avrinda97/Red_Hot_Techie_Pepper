2008-03-07T15:36:00.000Z	Corky_		:(
2008-03-07T15:36:00.000Z	Corky_		i hope not cos i've put alot into my OS
2008-03-07T15:36:00.000Z	Corky_		i was just about to stop using windows even
2008-03-07T15:38:00.000Z	Corky_		yeah i was trying to get some of my windows apps running in linux but now im running outta space
2008-03-07T15:38:00.000Z	Corky_		tricky
2008-03-07T15:39:00.000Z	Corky_		but im sure i'll figure it out i guess
2008-03-07T15:39:00.000Z	Corky_		oh
2008-03-07T15:39:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	Corky_	 .. like in windows, can u not just give another path to another hard drive ?
2008-03-07T15:40:00.000Z	Corky_	Linux_Fresher	i've never seen that option when install programs in linux
2008-03-07T15:40:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	Corky_	 erm .. now THAT sounds scary .. even i was thinking of dumping windows for good but looks like there is going to be time for that
2008-03-07T15:41:00.000Z	Corky_	Linux_Fresher	im not gonna abandon my ubuntu just yet lol
2008-03-07T15:41:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	Corky_	 yup.. this time i am going to give linux a full try .. how so ever i try though, i cant stop comparing it to windows concepts .. thats a BIG hold back
2008-03-07T15:43:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	Corky_	 may be something like /user2  on new HD that u have with big space ?  [ though its FUNNY to know that linux pkg doesnt ask you for the path where it wants to get installed .. all windows application setups do that >.< ]
2008-03-07T15:47:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	Corky_	 that one i know for sure .. its in documentation that comes with live CD .. those partitions are NOT ACCESSIBLE to windows and are used for DATA RECOVERY when windows goes south .. RECOMMENDATION = DO NOT TOUCH those partitions
2008-03-07T15:48:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	Corky_	 ya but ubuntu documentation says leave those special partitions alone .. so i would :)
2008-03-07T15:51:00.000Z	Corky_	Linux_Fresher	i thought the same thing too but now i got linux concepts stuck in my brain :S
2008-03-07T15:55:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	Corky_	 you are right there !! once u boot into ubuntu, its very hard to go back to windoz .. things look so great here :)
2008-03-07T15:55:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	Corky_	 lol since yesterday i have been on this Live CD thing ^^ .. it didnt even ask me for a gateway .. directly started my internet by talking to my router i guess
