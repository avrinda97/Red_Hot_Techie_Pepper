2007-07-10T10:13:00.000Z	Creeture	luical	can you delete them from a shell?
2007-07-10T10:14:00.000Z	Creeture	luical	Ah. Nevermind then. Uh, shift, right click, choose delete. Should bypass the Trash
2007-07-10T10:16:00.000Z	Creeture	luical	Let's get it to delete first then we'll figure that out.
2007-07-10T10:17:00.000Z	Creeture	luical	That's good. We now know that we're dealing with a trash problem.
2007-07-10T10:19:00.000Z	Creeture	luical	Yeah. I'm trying to make mine misbehave.
2007-07-10T10:19:00.000Z	Creeture	luical	Have some patience. Some of us have to work here.

2007-07-10T10:24:00.000Z	Creeture	luical	That's exactly your problem. https://bugs.launchpad.net/gnome-vfs/+bug/26633 is the original reference.
2007-07-10T10:25:00.000Z	Creeture	luical	Oh, no wonder it's broken. NTFS is still about as experimental as it gets with write support. ntfs-3g works pretty well, but it's still flaky.
