2011-07-29T19:10:00.000Z	ruser		hi, i've got a weird problem on ubuntu i'm trying to start a game server binary but when i execute it, it complains no such file but the file is clearly there!    included direcotry listing, stat listing, uname, and file entry, with strace  http://paste.ubuntu.com/654557/
2011-07-29T19:10:00.000Z	wols	ruser	it usually means a shared library it needs isn't there
2011-07-29T19:10:00.000Z	wols	ruser	run "ldd <execuable>"
2011-07-29T19:11:00.000Z	ruser	wols	ne2k:         not a dynamic executable
2011-07-29T19:11:00.000Z	wols	ruser	file <executable>
2011-07-29T19:11:00.000Z	ruser	wols	already in pastebin
2011-07-29T19:12:00.000Z	ruser	wols	paste.ubuntu.com/654557/
2011-07-29T19:13:00.000Z	wols	ruser	line 27:  dynamically linked (uses shared libs),
2011-07-29T19:13:00.000Z	ruser	wols	and yet ldd reports not a dynamic :)
2011-07-29T19:14:00.000Z	wols	ruser	strings <executable> |grep ".so"
2011-07-29T19:14:00.000Z	wols	ruser	strings <executable> |grep lib
2011-07-29T19:15:00.000Z	ruser	wols	 silly me i forgot to install ia32-libs
2011-07-29T19:19:00.000Z	ruser	wols	ne2k thanks guys,  the problem was i forgot to install ia32 libs
2011-07-29T19:21:00.000Z	wols	ruser	no he could not. pinning is a great way to kill the install
2011-07-29T19:21:00.000Z	ruser	wols	please explain?
2011-07-29T19:22:00.000Z	wols	ruser	pinning is 99% of the time a very very bad idea. and you never want to mix packages from different versions, which is what pinning would do in this case
2011-07-29T19:23:00.000Z	ruser	wols	fair enough. however the way i see it, if the package is super small with minimal dependencies, pinning works ok, as long as you are agnostic of what you are doing
2011-07-29T19:23:00.000Z	wols	ruser	"agnostic of what you are doing" == "if you don't care what you are doing" fyi
2011-07-29T19:24:00.000Z	wols	ruser	and apache is not small. a script which is available for architecture "all" is fine with pinning usually. a binary, especially like apache, is not
2011-07-29T19:24:00.000Z	ruser	wols	point taken on apache.
2011-07-29T19:25:00.000Z	ruser	wols	anyhow thanks for the troubleshooting :)
