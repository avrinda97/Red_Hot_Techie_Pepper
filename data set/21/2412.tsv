2010-05-22T02:42:00.000Z	Nhawdge1	jasunto	 UW?
2010-05-22T02:43:00.000Z	Nhawdge1	jasunto	I never actually looked into that, for everything except apache everything is clean from install
2010-05-22T02:44:00.000Z	Nhawdge1	jasunto	Since the server is headless I made sure the 192.168. is available to be accessing it, but it doesn't seem to help
2010-05-22T02:45:00.000Z	Nhawdge1	jasunto	I am on the local network but unless w3m works I don't think i coould open any more local
2010-05-22T02:47:00.000Z	Nhawdge1	jasunto	 sudo apt-get install transmission-daemon
2010-05-22T02:49:00.000Z	Nhawdge1	jasunto	Yessir
2010-05-22T02:51:00.000Z	Nhawdge1	jasunto	Doesn't look like it
2010-05-22T02:53:00.000Z	Nhawdge1	jasunto	 Yes that is setup and netstat shows nothing for anything in the 9000 range
2010-05-22T02:55:00.000Z	Nhawdge1	jasunto	 okay
2010-05-22T02:56:00.000Z	Nhawdge1	jasunto	changed it to the old port 9001, and it didn't show up in web or in netstat
2010-05-22T02:57:00.000Z	Nhawdge1	jasunto	nothing there
