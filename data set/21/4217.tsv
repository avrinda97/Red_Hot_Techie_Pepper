2008-09-14T04:54:00.000Z	uffo		5 years old card
2008-09-14T04:54:00.000Z	mgolisch	uffo	is it detect at all?
2008-09-14T04:55:00.000Z	mgolisch	uffo	like does lspci show it?
2008-09-14T04:57:00.000Z	uffo	mgolisch	how to test it
2008-09-14T04:57:00.000Z	mgolisch	uffo	ls -lh home/daniel/.rubyripper/freedb.yaml
2008-09-14T04:58:00.000Z	uffo	mgolisch	no such file or directory, is there easyer way
2008-09-14T05:00:00.000Z	mgolisch	uffo	sorry, ifconfig, if you type that does it show an interface eth0
2008-09-14T05:01:00.000Z	mgolisch	uffo	do you use dhcp?
2008-09-14T05:03:00.000Z	mgolisch	uffo	i just wanted to know if you get an ip from your router or need to setup the networking properties by hand
2008-09-14T05:04:00.000Z	mgolisch	uffo	if you have dhcp try this: sudo dhclient eth0     and see if you have an ip and the correct gateway set and can access the internets then
2008-09-14T05:07:00.000Z	mgolisch	uffo	that mostlikely means there is no dhcp server or the cable is not properly configured
2008-09-14T05:08:00.000Z	mgolisch	uffo	i mean the cable isnt luged in right or something
2008-09-14T05:09:00.000Z	mgolisch	uffo	try dmesg and see of theres something about the interface eth0
2008-09-14T05:11:00.000Z	mgolisch	uffo	there is something wrong with the link then, maybe try another cable/port on the router
2008-09-14T05:11:00.000Z	mgolisch	uffo	and what driver does it use? maybe thats some bug in the driver
2008-09-14T05:13:00.000Z	mgolisch	uffo	look what lspci shows for the lan card
2008-09-14T05:14:00.000Z	mgolisch	uffo	whats the full name? and what drivers are loaded for that?
2008-09-14T05:17:00.000Z	mgolisch	uffo	what driver does it use? maybe try dmesg|grep eth0    there might be some message from the driver
2008-09-14T05:24:00.000Z	mgolisch	uffo	i guess its just a card/chipset that isnt well supported, make sure the tulip driver is not loaded and that it uses dmfe as the driver, if that doesnt work get some other card
