2011-06-02T07:29:00.000Z	mouse		I'm thinking of getting an Acer Aspire One ZG5 with winxp installed and putting linux on it but I can't find any sort of compatibility list.  Does anyone have any information on this?
2011-06-02T07:29:00.000Z	dltucker	mouse	I am running on an acer aspireone
2011-06-02T07:30:00.000Z	dltucker	mouse	I have ubuntu 11 going..
2011-06-02T07:30:00.000Z	mouse	dltucker	What model?
2011-06-02T07:30:00.000Z	dltucker	mouse	ZG5  or is that ZGS
2011-06-02T07:31:00.000Z	dltucker	mouse	just got bifocals...   I think it is a zG5  and I only have one gb
2011-06-02T07:31:00.000Z	mouse	dltucker	How did you install ubuntu 11?
2011-06-02T07:32:00.000Z	mouse	dltucker	Did you have any problems with the wifi adapter?
2011-06-02T07:33:00.000Z	mouse	dltucker	That's strange behavior.
2011-06-02T07:34:00.000Z	dltucker	mouse	 the wifi works out of the box on both the ibm build and the other ubuntu builds that I have tried.
2011-06-02T07:38:00.000Z	mouse	dltucker	Over all what do hate the most about your acer aspire?
2011-06-02T07:40:00.000Z	dltucker	mouse	screensize and then keyboard is small.   and thirdly I guess I could use some more ram.   but it runs ubuntu 11 just fine
2011-06-02T07:41:00.000Z	mouse	dltucker	How much ram do you have?
2011-06-02T07:41:00.000Z	dltucker	mouse	1 gb
2011-06-02T07:41:00.000Z	dltucker	mouse	  actually if I was not tied to a couple of apps i would run ubuntu on my thinkpad
2011-06-02T07:42:00.000Z	mouse	dltucker	What apps?
2011-06-02T07:42:00.000Z	dltucker	mouse	mostly   ibm internal apps like the ibm ssct tool
2011-06-02T07:43:00.000Z	dltucker	mouse	 and I have yet to find an mp3/cdg karaoke program for linux...
2011-06-02T07:43:00.000Z	mouse	dltucker	I see.  I wouldn't know those apps so I wouldn't know a decent replacement either.
2011-06-02T07:43:00.000Z	dltucker	mouse	I also have a kodak printer  and afaik there is no linux driver for it..
2011-06-02T07:46:00.000Z	mouse	dltucker	Yeah printer drivers are a pain.  I know for sure cannon isn't very linux friendly at all.  I don't do much karaoke but a quick apt search gave me Performous.  Have you seen that yet?
