2006-04-12T05:39:00.000Z	pulgoki		damn, dapper is the new version of ubuntu?
2006-04-12T05:41:00.000Z	pulgoki		so how do i ask the bot questions myself? specificly how to install kde
2006-04-12T05:41:00.000Z	jnk	pulgoki	take the bot in private and type "kde" for example
2006-04-12T05:42:00.000Z	pulgoki		thanks
2006-04-12T05:43:00.000Z	pulgoki		haha
2006-04-12T05:43:00.000Z	pulgoki		i like how it say's (i "GUESS" kde is a powerfull desktop)
2006-04-12T05:43:00.000Z	pulgoki		haha
2006-04-12T05:44:00.000Z	pulgoki		yea
2006-04-12T05:44:00.000Z	pulgoki		i havent really messed with it much
2006-04-12T05:44:00.000Z	pulgoki		but it has nicer look to it
2006-04-12T05:44:00.000Z	pulgoki		i dont know which i would like more
2006-04-12T05:44:00.000Z	pulgoki		i like gnome fine
2006-04-12T05:44:00.000Z	jnk		the number one reason I don't use kde is the look
2006-04-12T05:44:00.000Z	jnk		at first I thought "wow really nice"
2006-04-12T05:44:00.000Z	pulgoki	jnk	there is allot more you can do with the look of kde
2006-04-12T05:45:00.000Z	pulgoki		if you dont like it, change it
2006-04-12T05:45:00.000Z	jnk		but after some hours I just feel... like tired
2006-04-12T05:45:00.000Z	pulgoki		gnome seems more limited
2006-04-12T05:45:00.000Z	pulgoki		as far as eye candy anyway
2006-04-12T05:45:00.000Z	pulgoki		they both have decent appz
2006-04-12T05:45:00.000Z	jnk	pulgoki	it is, but I don't care: what I would like to change in kde, I cannot, so...
