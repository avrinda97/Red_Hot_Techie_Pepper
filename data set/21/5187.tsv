2007-12-09T03:50:00.000Z	talcite_		hey guys, what's a good program for ripping CDs to ISO?
2007-12-09T03:50:00.000Z	talcite_		the default one with gnome doesn't seem to work for this particular cd
2007-12-09T03:50:00.000Z	david_J	talcite_	talcite_ k3b
2007-12-09T03:51:00.000Z	david_J	talcite_	or make a script
2007-12-09T03:51:00.000Z	talcite_	david_J	you can make a script to copy an ISO? 0.o
2007-12-09T03:51:00.000Z	david_J	talcite_	why couldn't you?
2007-12-09T03:52:00.000Z	david_J	talcite_	but k3b would probably be easier...
2007-12-09T03:52:00.000Z	talcite_	david_J	wouldn't you need to know how to encode into JFS?
2007-12-09T03:53:00.000Z	david_J	talcite_	why? all you need to do is put your music in a directory not to exceed the cdrom space, and use mkisofs
2007-12-09T03:53:00.000Z	talcite_	david_J	Also, k3b is no good, I'm using gnome
2007-12-09T03:53:00.000Z	david_J	talcite_	so apt-get install k3b...
2007-12-09T03:54:00.000Z	talcite_	david_J	install a whole DE for one program? 0.o
2007-12-09T03:54:00.000Z	david_J	talcite_	you dont have to....
2007-12-09T03:55:00.000Z	david_J	talcite_	so you just wanted to cp the raw data to a iso
2007-12-09T03:55:00.000Z	talcite_	david_J	yes
2007-12-09T03:55:00.000Z	david_J	talcite_	I thought you were doin files
2007-12-09T03:56:00.000Z	david_J	talcite_	but I am not sure how you'd listen to them...
2007-12-09T03:56:00.000Z	talcite_	david_J	It's a game, it's running too slowly off CD + wine emulation, so I'm hoping running off HDD would be faster
2007-12-09T03:56:00.000Z	david_J	talcite_	nvm... why didn't ya say so?
2007-12-09T03:57:00.000Z	david_J	talcite_	cat would work too or dd_rescue
2007-12-09T03:59:00.000Z	david_J	talcite_	yeah the loopback device
