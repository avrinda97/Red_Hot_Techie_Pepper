2007-01-29T11:32:00.000Z	IdleOne		think I want to upgrade to fiesty...should I?
2007-01-29T11:34:00.000Z	variant	IdleOne	I did a while ago (about 2 weeks) it works pretty flawlessly although thereis a constant risk of it being totaly borked by one of the regular updates
2007-01-29T11:34:00.000Z	variant	IdleOne	beryl etc all work.. if you'r on edgy though there are not a whole lot of differences yet.. not really worth the risk
2007-01-29T11:35:00.000Z	IdleOne	variant	on Edgy and if there isnt much difference then I'll wait for stable release
2007-01-29T11:35:00.000Z	IdleOne	variant	and welshbyte ty for the info
2007-01-29T11:35:00.000Z	variant	IdleOne	np

2007-04-19T14:18:00.000Z	IdleOne	variant	as funny as that was please dont :)
2007-04-19T15:37:00.000Z	variant	IdleOne	you are right, was un called for :) (although the evidence since speaks for it's self :))
2007-04-19T15:38:00.000Z	IdleOne	variant	 if you mean that you are reformed and now helping as much as you can in here and not calling ppl idiots then that is great :)
2007-04-19T15:39:00.000Z	variant	IdleOne	well, that's not exactlly what i was meaning but it is also the case
2007-04-19T15:40:00.000Z	IdleOne	variant	trolls are part of support channels if you learn to ignore them they go away. if they get to unruly then there is always the !ops function
2007-04-19T15:41:00.000Z	variant	IdleOne	thats true, they make me laugh more than anything and I know that ignoring them is the best way to deal with htem.. so hard sometimes though :)
2007-04-19T15:42:00.000Z	variant	IdleOne	i really really take issue with those that seem to "help but with deliberatlly wrong information"
2007-04-19T15:43:00.000Z	IdleOne	variant	if you see ppl giving the wrong info then you should inform the ops and they will ban them
2007-04-19T15:43:00.000Z	variant	IdleOne	ok
2007-04-19T15:44:00.000Z	IdleOne	variant	I got banned here one time for using words I should of known better to use on some troll. got a nice talking to by an Op *cough*ompaul*cough* and learned to just ignore hehe
