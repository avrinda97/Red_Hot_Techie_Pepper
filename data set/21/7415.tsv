2006-10-03T15:53:00.000Z	rukuartic	GreenLantern	Try "lsusb" and see what number it spits out for your wireless adapter
2006-10-03T15:54:00.000Z	rukuartic	GreenLantern	Inside a terminal, open up gnome-terminal or something
2006-10-03T15:56:00.000Z	GreenLantern	rukuartic	What do I do with the number that lsusb spits out?

2006-10-04T16:14:00.000Z	rukuartic	GreenLantern	Thats a complete tutorial on how to get it working
2006-10-04T16:15:00.000Z	rukuartic	GreenLantern	Yep, just follow through the thing completely
2006-10-04T16:16:00.000Z	GreenLantern	rukuartic	How can I be sure that it's not working already?  Because honestly, I don't know.
2006-10-04T16:16:00.000Z	rukuartic	GreenLantern	You can try "ifconfig" to see what interfaces you are, and then "iwlist (interface) scan"
2006-10-04T16:17:00.000Z	rukuartic	GreenLantern	But if it doesn't work, then you probably won't find stuff.
2006-10-04T16:17:00.000Z	rukuartic	GreenLantern	Sorry, if you don't find stuff, it won't work, and you need to follow the tutorial.
2006-10-04T16:19:00.000Z	GreenLantern	rukuartic	what should i see with ifconfig andiwlist
2006-10-04T16:19:00.000Z	rukuartic	GreenLantern	Ok, type iwconfig. you might see things like "eth0" or "wlan0" or something... try going "iwlist eth0 scan" or "iwlist wlan0 scan"
