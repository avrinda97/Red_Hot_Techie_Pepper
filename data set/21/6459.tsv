2007-04-06T15:25:00.000Z	shazzr		Geforce4 420 Go won't do XGL/AIGXL/Compiz/Beryl....at least I couldn't get it to work. So evertyhing Nvidia isn't just a walk in the park....

2007-04-06T15:26:00.000Z	shazzr	gnomefreak	edgy
2007-04-06T15:27:00.000Z	gnomefreak	shazzr	and you used nvidia-glx from repos?
2007-04-06T15:27:00.000Z	shazzr	gnomefreak	nvidia-glx-legacy
2007-04-06T15:28:00.000Z	gnomefreak	shazzr	no you need nvidia-glx geforce4 cards in edgy are supported with -glx package
2007-04-06T15:28:00.000Z	shazzr	gnomefreak	seriously? everyone told me i had to get the legacy-stuff....:s
2007-04-06T15:29:00.000Z	gnomefreak	shazzr	for feisty you do for edgy the glx drivers should work fine. what card is it?
2007-04-06T15:29:00.000Z	shazzr	gnomefreak	still the Geforce4 420 Go ;)
2007-04-06T15:30:00.000Z	gnomefreak	shazzr	did you try the legacy drivers from beryl repo?
2007-04-06T15:31:00.000Z	shazzr	gnomefreak	don't know.....i guess i used the ubuntu repo....
2007-04-06T15:32:00.000Z	gnomefreak	shazzr	please join #ubuntu-effects and read the edgy guide in /topic
2007-04-06T15:32:00.000Z	gnomefreak	shazzr	ubuntus legacy drivers dont support opengl
2007-04-06T15:33:00.000Z	shazzr	gnomefreak	so i should try with the beryl repo?
2007-04-06T15:33:00.000Z	gnomefreak	shazzr	yes
2007-04-06T15:33:00.000Z	gnomefreak	shazzr	read the guide it will give you name of package and how to isntall it
2007-04-06T16:01:00.000Z	shazzr	gnomefreak	just to clarify...you're ABSOLUTELY certain that beryl will work with the nvidia-glx? i'm about to reinstall....YET again....:s
2007-04-06T16:07:00.000Z	gnomefreak	shazzr	there is no promise beryl will work at all
2007-04-06T16:07:00.000Z	gnomefreak	shazzr	im not sure what version your card needs. read the topic in #ubuntu-effects for more info.
2007-04-06T05:31:00.000Z	shazzr	gnomefreak	still no dice. :S
2007-04-06T05:31:00.000Z	shazzr	gnomefreak	my xorg.conf at least shows that it uses the correct card/driver.....but when I restart gdm, i get an errormessage as follows: "Fatal error: no screens found"
