2007-01-16T17:05:00.000Z	Bogus8		does the live cd have NTFS support on it?
2007-01-16T17:06:00.000Z	Bogus8		!ntfs
2007-01-16T17:08:00.000Z	Bogus8		Am i correct in assuming that the live cd have NTFS support on it?
2007-01-16T17:09:00.000Z	Pommie	Bogus8	: Write support with ntfs is really ... erm... well, it's not perfect. :)
2007-01-16T17:09:00.000Z	Bogus8	Pommie	Stormx2: MKR: fdisk doesn't see the drive but gnome partition editor does any clue?
2007-01-16T17:11:00.000Z	Pommie	Bogus8	: I'd try the 'v'erify command to verify your fdisk partition
2007-01-16T17:13:00.000Z	Bogus8	Pommie	what verify command... I just searched the man file and there is no "verify" on fdisk?
2007-01-16T17:13:00.000Z	Pommie	Bogus8	: When you fire up fdisk on the drive, one of the menu of choices is 'v' to verify
2007-01-16T17:14:00.000Z	Pommie	Bogus8	: Note, I'm talking about the LINUX fdisk. :)
2007-01-16T17:14:00.000Z	Bogus8	Pommie	I can't even open it in fdisk "unable to open" yet gnome part. editor sees it??
2007-01-16T17:15:00.000Z	Bogus8	Pommie	I don't need to acess a linux partition
2007-01-16T17:15:00.000Z	Pommie	Bogus8	: You're doing something like "fdisk /dev/hdb" (no partition number)?
2007-01-16T17:15:00.000Z	Bogus8	Pommie	correct... I'm very familiar with fdisk when it sees the drive ;)
2007-01-16T17:16:00.000Z	Pommie	Bogus8	: Hrm... :)  Well, if fdisk isn't showing it, what do you see in your "dmesg" output that relates to the drives?
2007-01-16T17:17:00.000Z	Bogus8	Pommie	dmesg sees the drive and sees it properly (20gigs blah blah blah)
2007-01-16T17:18:00.000Z	Pommie	Bogus8	: Offhand, you got me. If dmesg shows it, and fdisk won't let you access it (what's the actual error?)...
2007-01-16T17:18:00.000Z	Bogus8	Pommie	when I do what, try to fdisk to it? it says unable to open
2007-01-16T17:19:00.000Z	Pommie	Bogus8	: obvious question... you're running fdisk as superuser, right? ;)
2007-01-16T17:19:00.000Z	Bogus8	Pommie	correct
2007-01-16T17:20:00.000Z	Pommie	Bogus8	: Sorry mang. I got nothin'.
2007-01-16T17:20:00.000Z	Bogus8	Pommie	no prob... I'll keep looking
