2009-05-02T17:58:00.000Z	Bodsda		Hi guys, I just upgraded my laptop to jaunty and now i have some strange display problems. The desktop displays perfectly, everything runs smoothly but Ubuntu does not fill the screen, it has two strips top to bottom on the outer left and right of the screen that are not being used, it reminds me of the annoying black lines on the top and bottom of your tv when watching a film on tv.
2009-05-02T17:58:00.000Z	Bodsda		Hope this makes sense, if you need more information please ask.
2009-05-02T17:58:00.000Z	dotblank1	Bodsda	do you know what the current screen resolution is?
2009-05-02T17:59:00.000Z	Bodsda	dotblank1	1024x768 i believe
2009-05-02T18:00:00.000Z	dotblank1	Bodsda	can you paste the output of "xrandr -q"
2009-05-02T18:02:00.000Z	Bodsda	dotblank1	http://pastebin.com/f1bd7b670
2009-05-02T18:03:00.000Z	dotblank1	Bodsda	try running "xrandr -s 1280x800"
2009-05-02T18:04:00.000Z	Bodsda	dotblank1	nice one batman! fixed, was 768 too small then?
2009-05-02T18:05:00.000Z	dotblank1	Bodsda	If it was a laptop then its screen porbally did not support 4:3 aspect ratios.. this is most likely its native resolution
2009-05-02T18:06:00.000Z	dotblank1	Bodsda	it just depends on the video card and monitor..
2009-05-02T18:07:00.000Z	Bodsda	dotblank1	oh, il remember that ty --i had a thread on this on ubuntuforums, i credited you (dotblank1) for the fix, did you want your forum name on their as well?
2009-05-02T18:08:00.000Z	dotblank1	Bodsda	its ok..
2009-05-02T18:08:00.000Z	Bodsda	dotblank1	ok, cheers :)
2009-05-02T19:23:00.000Z	dotblank1	Bodsda	can you paste your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file
2009-05-02T19:24:00.000Z	Bodsda	dotblank1	its standard  dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg   -- http://pastebin.com/f54f3da42
2009-05-02T19:25:00.000Z	dotblank1	Bodsda	wierd you could make a startup script to change it..
2009-05-02T19:25:00.000Z	dotblank1	Bodsda	or use the display dialog in preferance.. I dont know if that will persist
2009-05-02T19:25:00.000Z	Bodsda	dotblank1	no, i dont need to go that far, i know it can be set in xorg.conf just dont remember the correct string or which section
2009-05-02T19:26:00.000Z	Bodsda	dotblank1	the display dialog does not have an option to save settings
2009-05-02T19:26:00.000Z	dotblank1	Bodsda	well you can set it modelines and if its nvidia it does it a completly differant way
2009-05-02T19:27:00.000Z	Bodsda	dotblank1	ok, il do some research, ty
