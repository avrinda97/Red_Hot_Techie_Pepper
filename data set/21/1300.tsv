2011-03-06T19:20:00.000Z	Daghdha		Anyone know why my systems like to do this sometimes: the disk drive for /dev/sdc5/ is not yet ready or not present Press S to skip mounting
2011-03-06T19:20:00.000Z	dagon666	Daghdha	is it connected via usb ?
2011-03-06T19:21:00.000Z	Daghdha	dagon666	No it's a fixed disk
2011-03-06T19:21:00.000Z	Daghdha		It's a partition on the boot disk.
2011-03-06T19:22:00.000Z	dagon666	Daghdha	I assume that there are no similar problems with the rest of partitions on sdc ? What do you use sdc5 for ? Is it for data or swap ?
2011-03-06T19:23:00.000Z	Daghdha	dagon666	swap
2011-03-06T19:23:00.000Z	Daghdha	dagon666	I choose M and then ctrl-alt-delete rebooted it and it did boot ok. I'm not sure though if this was a fluke. You think the disk may be corrupt?
2011-03-06T19:23:00.000Z	dagon666	Daghdha	check with smartctl -a /dev/sdc
2011-03-06T19:24:00.000Z	dagon666		look for "Current pending sectors or reallocated ... "
2011-03-06T19:25:00.000Z	Daghdha		not installed, but in diskutility it is very unhappy
2011-03-06T19:25:00.000Z	dagon666	Daghdha	what exactly do you mean ?
2011-03-06T19:26:00.000Z	Daghdha	dagon666	red text for read errors. I am trying to locate the text you described in it
2011-03-06T19:26:00.000Z	Daghdha	dagon666	Yes, the value you mention is in WARNING
2011-03-06T19:26:00.000Z	dagon666	Daghdha	and what is the counter value ?
2011-03-06T19:27:00.000Z	Daghdha		worst 88, treshold 0,value 4 sectors
2011-03-06T19:27:00.000Z	dagon666	Daghdha	then, there is not much you can do. It will be worse and worse
2011-03-06T19:27:00.000Z	dagon666	Daghdha	the drive needs to be replaced
2011-03-06T19:27:00.000Z	Daghdha		Yes, i guess.
2011-03-06T19:30:00.000Z	dagon666	Daghdha	a partial solution would be to disable the partition swap and replace it with a file swap
2011-03-06T19:31:00.000Z	Daghdha		dagon666:That swap is only 2.5gb of a 1Tb drive. Wich is also my OS. I think i better change it.
2011-03-06T19:32:00.000Z	dagon666	Daghdha	for the good of your data you MUST change it but temporarily to get over those mount problems I suggest you to not use the swap partition and if it is neccessary use a swap file instead
