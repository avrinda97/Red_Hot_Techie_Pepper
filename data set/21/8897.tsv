2006-01-07T10:01:00.000Z	Goldfisch		Isn't libdvdcss in the restricted?
2006-01-07T10:01:00.000Z	Goldfisch		tell hou5ton about restricted
2006-01-07T10:01:00.000Z	Goldfisch		!tell hou5ton about restricted
2006-01-07T10:02:00.000Z	hou5ton	Goldfisch	 all I want to do is play a DVD movie
2006-01-07T10:03:00.000Z	Goldfisch	hou5ton	You need to install libdvdcss. It is in the restricted section.
2006-01-07T10:06:00.000Z	Goldfisch	hou5ton	Do you have libdvdcss2 installed?
2006-01-07T10:06:00.000Z	hou5ton	Goldfisch	 I clicked on it, and it asked me if I wanted to run it ( install it) and I said yes
2006-01-07T10:07:00.000Z	Goldfisch	hou5ton	In synaptic? Did you click the apply button to actually install that package?
2006-01-07T10:07:00.000Z	hou5ton	Goldfisch	 yes
2006-01-07T10:07:00.000Z	hou5ton	Goldfisch	 just a sec and I'll double check again
2006-01-07T10:07:00.000Z	Goldfisch	hou5ton	So, now synaptic shows that library is installed?
2006-01-07T10:08:00.000Z	hou5ton	Goldfisch	 it shows that libdvdread3 is installed
2006-01-07T10:08:00.000Z	hou5ton	Goldfisch	 just a sec
2006-01-07T10:09:00.000Z	hou5ton	Goldfisch	 no such file in Synaptic
2006-01-07T10:09:00.000Z	Goldfisch	hou5ton	You nead to add restricted to your repositories. libdvdcss2 is a library used for decrypting DVDs.
2006-01-07T10:11:00.000Z	Goldfisch	hou5ton	You haven't done it until you can find libdvdcss listed on synaptic. It is in the restricted repository. Have you added that repository in synaptic?
2006-01-07T10:12:00.000Z	hou5ton	Goldfisch	 ok ... I have added some in that config file .... but don't recall if that is one of them
2006-01-07T10:21:00.000Z	Goldfisch	hou5ton	dpkg -l | grep libdvdcss
2006-01-07T10:21:00.000Z	Goldfisch	hou5ton	Got it?
2006-01-07T10:22:00.000Z	hou5ton	Goldfisch	 I get command not found
2006-01-07T10:38:00.000Z	Goldfisch	hou5ton	Good job.
