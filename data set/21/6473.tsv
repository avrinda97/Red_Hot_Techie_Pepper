2007-03-28T09:53:00.000Z	I_Glitch		Perfectly.
2007-03-28T09:53:00.000Z	I_Glitch		lol, yeah, and I learned a lot, which is always good.
2007-03-28T09:54:00.000Z	I_Glitch		:D
2007-03-28T09:54:00.000Z	I_Glitch		And I don't have to restart my updates that have been running for a few hours, lol.
2007-03-28T09:55:00.000Z	I_Glitch		Ok, now I wonder wtf is wrong with my screensaver that is making it do that. :S
2007-03-28T09:56:00.000Z	I_Glitch		I guess I best disable it for now.
2007-03-28T09:56:00.000Z	I_Glitch		lol, that's cool.
2007-03-28T09:57:00.000Z	I_Glitch		Now I need to find a program that will give me processor temp readouts.
2007-03-28T09:59:00.000Z	rbil	I_Glitch	you'll need a program called lmsensors and then you can use GKrellM to display the temperatures
2007-03-28T10:00:00.000Z	rbil	I_Glitch	lmsensors will probe temperatures, fan speeds, etc.
2007-03-28T10:04:00.000Z	rbil	I_Glitch	package is called lm-sensors
2007-03-28T10:06:00.000Z	rbil	I_Glitch	then read the README or man page, as you have to do something before lmsensors will work. Can't remember it's been so long that I've installed it
2007-03-28T10:07:00.000Z	I_Glitch	rbil	Hmm, says it's already installed, where do I find the readme or man for that?
2007-03-28T10:07:00.000Z	rbil	I_Glitch	lots of docs ... see what this gives u ... /usr/share/doc/lm-sensors/doc/lm_sensors-FAQ.html
2007-03-28T10:11:00.000Z	I_Glitch	rbil	boy, that's a big file, I got my work cut out for me...
2007-03-28T10:11:00.000Z	rbil	I_Glitch	if I got it working, I'm sure it's not as daunting as it looks :-)
2007-03-28T10:12:00.000Z	I_Glitch	rbil	lol, and I thought MBM5 on WinXP was hard to set up the first few times lol, that stuff is like cake now.
2007-03-28T10:13:00.000Z	rbil	I_Glitch	just go and read the section on 3 Installation and Management, and work from there. The thing will probably sense everytime you fart, but for the basics, shouldn't be too hard
2007-03-28T10:14:00.000Z	rbil	I_Glitch	the program that sets up sensors is called: sensors-detect
2007-03-28T10:16:00.000Z	I_Glitch	rbil	lol, I started skimming and that's where I'm at, I'm new to this whole linux thing though, a lot of what is common terminology to the author is confusing to me.  I'm still adjusting to the learning curve.
2007-03-28T10:51:00.000Z	I_Glitch	rbil	you still there?
