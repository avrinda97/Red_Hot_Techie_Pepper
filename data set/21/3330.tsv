2009-05-16T05:11:00.000Z	vasser		hello
2009-05-16T05:11:00.000Z	vasser		i am trying to set up my audigy2 sound card under ubuntu
2009-05-16T05:12:00.000Z	vasser		so far i got to the point where in sound-test i hear all speakers
2009-05-16T05:12:00.000Z	vasser		(should i be hearing static ?)
2009-05-16T05:12:00.000Z	dtchen	vasser	what are you trying to do, and what is happening instead?
2009-05-16T05:13:00.000Z	vasser		but when i run a movie to play with Totem it detects it as stereo (and it is not)
2009-05-16T05:13:00.000Z	vasser		in vlc i cannot even choose a device when playing a movie
2009-05-16T05:13:00.000Z	vasser		both movies (and others i have tried) are hd movies with 5.1 sound, either dts or ac3
2009-05-16T05:14:00.000Z	vasser		i have already set up a default sound card
2009-05-16T05:14:00.000Z	vasser		and changed in the settings of gnome to use the audigy as default
2009-05-16T05:14:00.000Z	dtchen	vasser	if you want 5.1 through ac3, you need to configure pulseaudio to use that device.
2009-05-16T05:15:00.000Z	dtchen	vasser	that means either modifying /etc/pulse/default.pa or ~/.pulse/default.pa
2009-05-16T05:16:00.000Z	vasser	dtchen	what do i need to change in that file ?
2009-05-16T05:16:00.000Z	dtchen	vasser	the module-alsa-sink device
2009-05-16T05:17:00.000Z	vasser	dtchen	should i just uncomment it ?
2009-05-16T05:17:00.000Z	vasser		(single line or whole section .. ?)
2009-05-16T05:17:00.000Z	dtchen	vasser	you will need to change it completely. there are hints on the web.
2009-05-16T05:18:00.000Z	vasser		okey, i will look for it
2009-05-16T05:18:00.000Z	vasser		thanks
2009-05-16T05:21:00.000Z	vasser	dtchen	is it possible to get the same results using alsa ?
2009-05-16T05:22:00.000Z	dtchen	vasser	some things are easier when you remove pulseaudio from the equation
