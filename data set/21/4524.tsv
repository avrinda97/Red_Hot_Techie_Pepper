2009-04-11T13:01:00.000Z	krishna	knoxville	in a linux website.. its told that "rm -rf /" is dangerous
2009-04-11T13:01:00.000Z	knoxville	krishna	well it will delete everything without asking you twice
2009-04-11T13:02:00.000Z	krishna	knoxville	what do you mean by "Everything" ?
2009-04-11T13:02:00.000Z	knoxville	krishna	well / refers to the root directory which means it would delte everything inside the root directory that you have permission to delete
2009-04-11T13:03:00.000Z	krishna	knoxville	then will it delete the system files too ???
2009-04-11T13:03:00.000Z	knoxville	krishna	if you own the webserver and have sudo permissions, yes!
2009-04-11T13:04:00.000Z	krishna	knoxville	you mean , it wil delet the contents of home folder too  ;-P
2009-04-11T13:05:00.000Z	knoxville	krishna	yes!  what are you trying to do?
2009-04-11T13:06:00.000Z	krishna	knoxville	i want to know what all it will delete ..... it will also empty the windows drives of C  D E F too ? :-O :O
2009-04-11T13:06:00.000Z	krishna	knoxville	if yes, then this command wil be dangerous ,. wont it ? :O
2009-04-11T13:07:00.000Z	knoxville	krishna	if you type mount you can view if other filesystems are mounted to / and yet it would delete them also
2009-04-11T13:09:00.000Z	krishna	knoxville	then why ubuntu allows this dangerous command ? :(
2009-04-11T13:10:00.000Z	knoxville	krishna	windows allows it also, "format c: /q /u
2009-04-11T13:10:00.000Z	krishna	knoxville	clearscreen, now i understand 100%
