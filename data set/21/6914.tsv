2007-02-18T16:38:00.000Z	whileimhere		I am using gRip to rip my CDs to MP3. Everytime I insert a CD into the cd drive Sound Juicer comes up. Is there a setting that I can change that will make gRip com up?

2008-06-10T16:26:00.000Z	soundray	whileimhere	the SIS driver has no 3D acceleration. Go without 3D effects -- they aren't that important

2008-06-22T02:37:00.000Z	soundray	whileimhere	'sudo apt-get autoremove' cleans out orphaned packages. Consider also 'apt-get autoclean'
2008-06-22T02:37:00.000Z	soundray	whileimhere	man apt-get makes for good reading

2008-07-21T05:13:00.000Z	soundray	whileimhere	that's plenty, unless you open a lot of gnome apps
2008-07-21T05:15:00.000Z	soundray	whileimhere	digikam will be a bit slower to open under gnome than under KDE, because it will access some shared libraries that will already be cached under KDE.

2008-07-21T05:17:00.000Z	soundray	whileimhere	I did add a lot of extra software, though
2008-07-21T05:19:00.000Z	soundray	whileimhere	okay -- but openoffice takes more space than any other program or suite of programs
2008-07-21T05:20:00.000Z	soundray	whileimhere	of those that are standard, I mean
2008-07-21T05:22:00.000Z	soundray	whileimhere	I know, I wouldn't give it up. Just saying that most of the things you might add after your basic Ubuntu installation won't be nearly as big as OOo
