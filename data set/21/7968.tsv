2006-09-21T13:49:00.000Z	RedRose		how do I change my hostname in the CLI?
2006-09-21T13:50:00.000Z	jrib	RedRose	/etc/hostname and update /etc/hosts as well
2006-09-30T08:04:00.000Z	jrib	RedRose	it only starts the first time, but I believe it is something in ~/.bashrc that comes form /etc/skel/.bashrc
2006-09-30T08:04:00.000Z	jrib	RedRose	s/start/displays
2006-09-30T08:06:00.000Z	jrib	RedRose	right click on the workspace panel applet and go to preferences.  Let me check my sudo comment, I could be wrong about the location
2006-09-30T08:07:00.000Z	RedRose	jrib	ok, thanks... i know what .bashrc is and all, but i've skimmed it any found nothing to do with sudo, I'm using edgy, but i though i'd come here cause htey are all quety over their
2006-09-30T08:08:00.000Z	jrib	RedRose	yeah, I'm on edgy too and can't find it.  But I am pretty sure it used to be in there.  What is happening?  Is the message appearing everytime you start a terminal?
2006-09-30T08:09:00.000Z	jrib	RedRose	and you checked /root/.bash* ?
2006-09-30T08:13:00.000Z	jrib	RedRose	well worst case scenario, take a long phrase, that sounds pretty unique and grep / for it overnight :)
2006-09-30T08:13:00.000Z	jrib	RedRose	phrase fromt the message I mean
2006-09-30T08:14:00.000Z	jrib	RedRose	ah, I found it.  It's in /etc/bash.bashrc
2006-09-30T08:14:00.000Z	jrib	RedRose	so it shouldn't run if you have .sudo_as_admin_successful in your $HOME it seems
2007-03-09T16:49:00.000Z	jrib	RedRose	using screen is the only way I know of
2007-04-14T13:38:00.000Z	jrib	RedRose	double click on the speaker, check the PCM level
2007-04-14T13:38:00.000Z	RedRose	jrib	at 100%
2007-04-14T13:38:00.000Z	jrib	RedRose	and the knob on your speakers?
2007-04-14T13:38:00.000Z	RedRose	jrib	Yes, that too... that's what I ment that it's at 100% lol
2007-04-14T13:39:00.000Z	jrib	RedRose	and "Front" when you double click on the speakers is at 100% too?
2007-04-14T13:39:00.000Z	jrib	RedRose	I don't know then
2007-04-14T13:39:00.000Z	jrib	RedRose	check for loose cables
2007-04-14T13:40:00.000Z	RedRose	jrib	It's a laptop
