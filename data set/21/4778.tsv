2008-02-28T04:42:00.000Z	ph0rensic	Devourer	compile a .exe?? for what?
2008-02-28T04:42:00.000Z	Devourer	ph0rensic	for Windows, but I want to compile it on Ubuntu.
2008-02-28T04:43:00.000Z	ph0rensic	Devourer	I see... off hand I don't know that is done.. maybe there is a command line swith you use for that
2008-02-28T04:47:00.000Z	ph0rensic	Devourer	perhaps you get a virtual windows in vmware or virtual box, then compile it.. your technically in ubuntu, but windows is technically compiling.. probably not what you want though im suspecting
2008-02-28T04:50:00.000Z	ph0rensic	Devourer	I see your dilemma .. I dont know
2008-02-28T04:51:00.000Z	ph0rensic	Devourer	give it a try then ..
2008-02-28T04:52:00.000Z	Devourer	ph0rensic	I did try it, although, the same program that compiled with gcc said that the GTK+ library when trying to compile for a .exe had syntax error somewhere.
2008-02-28T04:53:00.000Z	ph0rensic	Devourer	does it show the location??
2008-02-28T04:55:00.000Z	ph0rensic	Devourer	you HAVE to compile it ??
2008-02-28T04:55:00.000Z	Devourer	ph0rensic	what do you mean?
2008-02-28T04:55:00.000Z	ph0rensic	Devourer	There isn't a binary of the source you are trying to compile??
2008-02-28T04:56:00.000Z	ph0rensic	Devourer	yes they most likely are
2008-02-28T04:56:00.000Z	Devourer	ph0rensic	well, I'm the one writing the program... I'll ask in the #gtk+ channel on GIMP IRCd.
2008-02-28T04:57:00.000Z	ph0rensic	Devourer	I see .. sorry bud
2008-02-28T04:58:00.000Z	Devourer	ph0rensic	it's cool. I just wish it would work on Windows, so hard to set up on Windows... Lol, that's Windows for you.
2008-02-28T04:59:00.000Z	Devourer	ph0rensic	yes they say I need a win32 GTK+ library which I will then be able to compile.
2008-02-28T05:01:00.000Z	ph0rensic	Devourer	wow that was fast .. yah it makes sense there would be a different library for win
2008-02-28T05:02:00.000Z	Devourer	ph0rensic	if you are interested here is the link on how... http://live.gnome.org/Cross%20compiling%20GTK%2B%20for%20Win32
2008-02-28T05:02:00.000Z	ph0rensic	Devourer	Ill have a looksie
2008-02-28T09:28:00.000Z	ph0rensic	Devourer	sort of you dont actually become root but your commands run with root privs
