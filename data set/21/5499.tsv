2007-11-30T21:49:00.000Z	cyrano		Here is my output of lsusb and dmesg: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/46346/
2007-11-30T21:49:00.000Z	cyrano		This is all done while my windows mobile device is connected... Why doesnt it show up?
2007-11-30T21:49:00.000Z	cyrano		thanks for helping out
2007-11-30T21:50:00.000Z	soundray	cyrano	it's a timing problem. Try connecting the device repeatedly until you don't get the read/64 error.
2007-11-30T21:54:00.000Z	cyrano	soundray	how shall i see if i get a read error? with dmesg? And just connect/unconnect a lot of times? I've allready done that. And it all started with VMWare interfaring with my USB device... is there anyway to undo what VMWare may have done?
2007-11-30T21:55:00.000Z	soundray	cyrano	the read/64 errors are in dmesg output, but should be logged to /var/log/syslog as well
2007-11-30T21:56:00.000Z	cyrano	soundray	and you are right its a hardware problem. I allways used to see the windows mobile device as a wired network in nm-applet
2007-11-30T21:57:00.000Z	soundray	cyrano	I doubt that vmware has done it to your device. Do try a reset on it, though
2007-11-30T21:58:00.000Z	cyrano	soundray	I'm guessing vmware did this to my USB port...? I've tried a reset and reconnecting doent help. I still get read errors.
2007-11-30T21:59:00.000Z	soundray	cyrano	are you running Ubuntu as a vmware guest?
2007-11-30T22:00:00.000Z	cyrano	soundray	Ubuntu is host. XP is guest. But right now it won't even connect to host
2007-11-30T22:04:00.000Z	cyrano	soundray	Ubuntu is host. XP is guest. But right now it won't even connect to host through usb port
2007-11-30T22:05:00.000Z	soundray	cyrano	does Windows see any of it when you connect the ppc while Windows has focus?
2007-11-30T22:06:00.000Z	cyrano	soundray	no. and the usb device option in VM menu shows no device to connect
2007-11-30T22:07:00.000Z	cyrano	soundray	I have tried using virtualbox to. It shows my logitech mouse when connected but no ppc
2007-11-30T22:09:00.000Z	soundray	cyrano	I don't know what to suggest, other than trying to connect it to a Windows host
2007-11-30T22:11:00.000Z	cyrano	soundray	ok. but its my ubuntu usb device which has problems now... well. thanks anyway for your help
2007-11-30T22:11:00.000Z	soundray	cyrano	you mean you have trouble with other USB devices as well?
2007-11-30T22:13:00.000Z	cyrano	soundray	not that i know of yet
2007-11-30T22:13:00.000Z	soundray	cyrano	what do you mean by "Ubuntu USB device" then?
2007-11-30T22:14:00.000Z	cyrano	soundray	I thought so... but its maybe just my ppc... My wrong :)
