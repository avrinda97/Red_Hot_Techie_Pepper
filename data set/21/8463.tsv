2006-04-07T16:55:00.000Z	PlantPerson		What's the minimum space you'd suggest? I want to set up a dual boot and I only have 20 GB hard drive
2006-04-07T16:56:00.000Z	PlantPerson		I'm not planning to do anything complicated
2006-04-07T16:57:00.000Z	PlantPerson		I was planning four GB. So, that should do very nicely.
2006-04-07T16:57:00.000Z	PlantPerson		thanks fissy
2006-04-07T09:26:00.000Z	PlantPerson		I installed a dual-boot with ubuntu last night
2006-04-07T09:26:00.000Z	PlantPerson		But my windows partitions appear to be owned by root
2006-04-07T09:27:00.000Z	PlantPerson		how can I change the permissions so that I own them and not root?
2006-04-07T09:27:00.000Z	PlantPerson		Hi sam_
2006-04-07T09:28:00.000Z	PlantPerson		Is there a way to change it permanently?
2006-04-07T09:30:00.000Z	PlantPerson		They do mount automatically already... but I'm not allowed to read them except through the partition view thing

2006-04-07T09:40:00.000Z	sfar	PlantPerson	basically what you need to do is 1) backup /etc/fstab, 2) remove the automounted hdd's from /etc/fstab.. 3) run the discmounter-script from ubuntu wikipedia
