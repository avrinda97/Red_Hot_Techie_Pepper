2011-05-14T23:12:00.000Z	ThinkT510	edgy	no
2011-05-14T23:12:00.000Z	edgy	ThinkT510	from karmic to natty?
2011-05-14T23:13:00.000Z	ThinkT510	edgy	only from one lts to the next or from one release to the next
2011-05-14T23:14:00.000Z	edgy	ThinkT510	xangua: ok I have a friend with karmic, I tried update-manager -d and it shows no updates available, what's the correct procedure then
2011-05-14T23:15:00.000Z	ThinkT510	edgy	karmic is no longer supported, best to do a fresh install
2011-05-14T23:16:00.000Z	edgy	ThinkT510	ok I already did changed all karmic occurences to natty and did dist-upgrade for him and left the office, now this is serious, how can I proceed?
2011-05-14T23:17:00.000Z	ThinkT510	edgy	you did a fresh install of karmic and changed the sources to natty? you should never do that
2011-05-14T23:18:00.000Z	edgy	ThinkT510	it's a karmic installation and he did work for some time on it and have critical files. I already did that and thought there would be no problem
2011-05-14T23:19:00.000Z	edgy	ThinkT510	now I need some help
2011-05-14T23:19:00.000Z	ThinkT510	edgy	get the critical files off the machine, store them somewhere safe and do a fresh install of natty (if you want natty)
2011-05-14T23:20:00.000Z	edgy	ThinkT510	ok so if the system didn't boot I would do that, but isn't there any possibility that it would work?
2011-05-14T23:21:00.000Z	ThinkT510	edgy	updating like you described will not work because it isn't designed to do that, get a livecd to recover whatever files you need
2011-05-14T23:21:00.000Z	edgy	ThinkT510	ok thanks for the tip
2011-05-14T23:22:00.000Z	ThinkT510	edgy	np, and please check before doing something major like changing update sources
2011-05-14T23:24:00.000Z	edgy	ThinkT510	sure. I remembered I do this to my laptop and upgraded it that way and things went smooth this is why I didn
2011-05-14T23:24:00.000Z	edgy	ThinkT510	didn't thought it would cause an issue
2011-05-14T23:25:00.000Z	edgy	ThinkT510	but now I understand it should be one level up not more, right?
2011-05-14T23:26:00.000Z	ThinkT510	edgy	yes, or from one lts release to another
2011-05-14T23:26:00.000Z	ThinkT510	edgy	the update manager should give you the option itself, so there shouldn't be a need to edit the lists yourself
2011-05-14T23:27:00.000Z	edgy	ThinkT510	so that editing is an old method which is deprecated now in favor of update-manager, right?
2011-05-14T23:28:00.000Z	ThinkT510	edgy	i can't recall it being used officially as an update method
