2012-01-17T00:59:00.000Z	chex_		What's the go-to way for setting a program/command to autostart?
2012-01-17T00:59:00.000Z	chex_		Not via GUI, that is
2012-01-17T00:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chex_	is it a gui app?
2012-01-17T01:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chex_	ln -s /usr/share/applications/transmission-gtk.desktop ~/.config/autostart/transmission-gtk.desktop          will do it
2012-01-17T01:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chex_	I use LXDE too ;)
2012-01-17T01:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chex_	what won't start?
2012-01-17T01:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chex_	its not the binary you link in there, its the .desktop file
2012-01-17T01:03:00.000Z	chex_	ActionParsnip	I simply copied another one of the .desktop-files I had there and changed the name and parametres
2012-01-17T01:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chex_	if you want special options, run:   cp /usr/share/applications/transmission-gtk.desktop ~/.config/autostart/transmission-gtk.desktop; leafpad ~/.config/autostart/transmission-gtk.desktop
2012-01-17T01:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chex_	then edit the file as you need
2012-01-17T01:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chex_	same deal, leafpad is just default in LXDE
2012-01-17T01:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chex_	you may want to add it in /etc/rc.local   then, it will start it there. If you have a GUI why not use the GUI app..
2012-01-17T01:06:00.000Z	chex_	ActionParsnip	I have no use of a GUI app since I will only control it remotely from my windows PC. It's my rather weak HTPC I'm installing it on and I want as much resources as possible for video rendering
2012-01-17T01:06:00.000Z	chex_	ActionParsnip	http://pastebin.com/a5w8QhXx
2012-01-17T01:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chex_	in /etc/rc.local  above the exit 0 line add:    su - chex -c transmission-daemon -a 10.0.0.* -g /home/chex/.config/transmission-daemon/ -c /home/chex/Downloads/Torrents/ -gsr 1 --incomplete-dir /media/Externa/Nedladdningar/ -u chex -v chex -epHidden=true &
2012-01-17T01:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chex_	or add it to @boot in cron
2012-01-17T01:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chex_	always a pleasure, thanks for the gratitude :)
2012-01-17T01:21:00.000Z	chex_	ActionParsnip	It still wont start
2012-01-17T01:21:00.000Z	chex_	ActionParsnip	I ran ps ax | grep trans without any results :(
2012-01-17T01:32:00.000Z	chex_	ActionParsnip	It worked without the su - chex -c
2012-01-17T01:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chex_	sweet, I'd test it so it runs fully as expected :)
