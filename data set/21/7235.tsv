2011-09-19T05:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	terr	Not with an Ubuntu iso.
2011-09-19T05:06:00.000Z	terr	Jordan_U	then IMHO we should fix it.
2011-09-19T05:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	terr	If you read IdleOne's comment to you, you would see that it will be fixed in the next release of Ubuntu.
2011-09-19T05:07:00.000Z	terr	Jordan_U	I did read the comment.  I'm not waiting.  I have to build a whole new computer because I'm not going to touch the one which works until I get the new puppy running.
2011-09-19T05:08:00.000Z	terr	Jordan_U	I've faced unable to access the kingston memory stick on the puter which is my desktop but my openBSD webserver works and there is nothing I can find to write to the stupid stick and no instructions... and its simple dimple.  I did it last centrury.
2011-09-19T05:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	terr	Please try to calm down. It is possible to make a bootable USB with Ubuntu on it. The easiest way is using Ubuntu's Startup Disk creator or Unetbootin. If that's not feasable for you for some reason there are other options as well.
2011-09-19T05:10:00.000Z	terr	Jordan_U	now I dug out some junk and found three dual cpu TYAN T230's and I guess my shortest solution is build a new machine from the ground up.
2011-09-19T05:11:00.000Z	terr	Jordan_U	and that won't run on OpenBsd.  it won't run on Debian Sarge and the old DD in sarge won't mount the stick.
2011-09-19T05:11:00.000Z	terr	Jordan_U	catch-22 everywhere.
2011-09-19T05:12:00.000Z	terr	Jordan_U	found an old P1-200 mHz.  CPU is missing an instrcution.  Well its likely 15 yeras old anyways.  But it works!
2011-09-19T05:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	terr	Then I would recommend copying the iso (as a file on a filesystem) to the USB drive (or whatever drive you want to make bootable) and install and configure grub2 to loop boot it.
2011-09-19T05:12:00.000Z	terr	Jordan_U	can't do that on sarge because it can't mount the stick.
2011-09-19T05:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	terr	What happens when you try to mount the flash drive? What filesystem is on the drive?
2011-09-19T05:13:00.000Z	terr	Jordan_U	no worries anyways.  I'm going to put the new MB into a case and move the CPU and Ram from the dead boxen over and I'll get it running.
2011-09-19T05:14:00.000Z	terr	Jordan_U	I detroyed it.  It was fat and I blew that away.... but it doesn't matter because the machine I was going to try died!  I think a cap on the MB blew.  I don't think it can boot from a USB stick anyways.
2011-09-19T05:16:00.000Z	terr	Jordan_U	and the only peripherals on that puppy are a USB and that's it.  No CD.  No FDD.  No HDD with na O/S and it does have a nic... and also 6 video connections so it can run six (heads) whihc I guess means its a devil... but it died on the way to the linux user's group.
2011-09-19T05:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	terr	If the situation is resolved and you no longer need support then please stop discussing the issue.
2011-09-19T05:21:00.000Z	terr	Jordan_U	the issue is poor bootstrap proceedures and that is not resolved.  it should not take a sysadmin with consulting backup to install ubuntu on any POS that runs.
2011-09-19T05:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	terr	This channel is for support, not ranting. And please watch your language (abbreviated or not). This is your last warning.
2011-09-19T05:22:00.000Z	terr	Jordan_U	I should be able to stuff a DOS fdd boot disk in or anything since and do an install... and I do know how to program DOS and in assembler too.
2011-09-19T05:24:00.000Z	terr	Jordan_U	all I'm saying is that if the machine can run the HDD then we should be able to do an install...  even if we need to use dd
