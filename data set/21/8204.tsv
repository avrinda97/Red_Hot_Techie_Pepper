2006-05-30T14:27:00.000Z	Hso		okay.. I have a question... is it actually possible to run ubuntu(installation or livecd)  via a usb stick?
2006-05-30T14:28:00.000Z	Hso		I've heard of DSL :P
2006-05-30T14:28:00.000Z	Hso		it doesn't have enough features for me :(
2006-05-30T14:28:00.000Z	Hso		o.O? how? :P
2006-05-30T14:29:00.000Z	Hso		I ask this because, my bro has a crap(and I mean CRAP) laptop, it's a pent3 750mhz with 64megs of ram(I think)... he said he wants to try out linux, but the cd drive is fucked... it doesn't open x_X;
2006-05-30T14:29:00.000Z	Hso		spec - I don't actually have a usb stick, yet :P
2006-05-30T14:30:00.000Z	Hso		spec - his ethernet adapter doesn't work lol
2006-05-30T14:30:00.000Z	Hso		my bro's laptop currently runs WinXP.. it's snailspeed -.-
2006-05-30T14:31:00.000Z	Hso		spec - correct.. tricky lol
2006-05-30T14:31:00.000Z	Hso		xubuntu? I thought the rumour of it being faster than ubuntu was not proven?
2006-05-30T14:32:00.000Z	apokryphos	Hso	xubuntu uses xfce, which is a lot more lightweight than gnome, really/
2006-06-13T05:58:00.000Z	apokryphos	Hso	not necessarily, you could have a 64-bit browser that can handle 32-bit plugins (i.e. Konqueror)
2006-06-13T05:59:00.000Z	apokryphos	Hso	you still couldn't use it on Ubuntu without a chroot though; no BiArch-compatible.
2006-06-13T06:00:00.000Z	Hso	apokryphos	I have no idea what you're talking about :P
2006-06-13T06:01:00.000Z	apokryphos	Hso	AMD64s can perfectly well execute 32-bit binaries (it's backward-compatible), but the Ubuntu package management system isn't set to be BiArch-compatible unfortunately.
2006-06-13T06:01:00.000Z	apokryphos	Hso	some talk of getting it to be for Edgy, but we'll have to wait and see.
2006-06-13T06:02:00.000Z	apokryphos	Hso	it's like another Ubuntu installation on your computer. It's often used for building packages (since you can get a completely new environment) or for distributions like Ubuntu which aren't BiArch so you can have 32bit programs
2006-06-13T06:06:00.000Z	apokryphos	Hso	we like to call that configurability and extensibility :)
2006-06-13T06:07:00.000Z	apokryphos	Hso	hm, I wouldn't say it had "junk" that way. And anyway, with regard to applications, GTK/GNOME are just as guilty of having several applications to do the same thing 8)
2006-06-13T06:08:00.000Z	apokryphos	Hso	really?
2006-06-13T06:09:00.000Z	Hso	apokryphos	for me, it is :P
