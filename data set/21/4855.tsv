2008-04-05T02:26:00.000Z	unop_	cookie	you can use gtkpod
2008-04-05T02:26:00.000Z	unop_	cookie	errm, sure, why not?
2008-04-05T02:27:00.000Z	unop_	cookie	well, it does but requires a newer version of libgpod .. add this line to your sources.list  "deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ipod-touch/ubuntu gutsy main"  .. and then reinstall gtkpod
2008-04-05T02:30:00.000Z	cookie	unop_	I am uninstalling the old gtkpod right now
2008-04-05T02:30:00.000Z	cookie	unop_	So after that...where do I get gpodlib from?
2008-04-05T02:30:00.000Z	unop_	cookie	you need to add that line into your /etc/apt/sources.list -- open it like this.   gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
2008-04-05T02:31:00.000Z	unop_	cookie	and then drop this line in at the bottom.  deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ipod-touch/ubuntu gutsy main
2008-04-05T02:31:00.000Z	unop_	cookie	then run this command.  sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install gtk-pod
2008-04-05T02:31:00.000Z	cookie	unop_	I know how to open a text file...but I think that line is invalid
2008-04-05T02:32:00.000Z	cookie	unop_	sorry
2008-04-05T02:32:00.000Z	unop_	cookie	invalid? what makes you think that?
