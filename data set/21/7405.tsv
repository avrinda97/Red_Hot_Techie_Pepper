2006-10-09T06:22:00.000Z	david83		is it possible to give different users different /tmp directories?
2006-10-09T06:22:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	david83	why ?
2006-10-09T06:23:00.000Z	david83	wickedpuppy	just for better cleaning up issues
2006-10-09T06:24:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	david83	cleaning up what ? actually if you go to /tmp there should be sub dirs with names ...
2006-10-09T06:26:00.000Z	david83	wickedpuppy	i got different users on the machine and it makes conflicts because of some gnomefiles located in /tmp ;(
2006-10-09T06:27:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	david83	and why you need to delete them ?
2006-10-09T06:28:00.000Z	david83	wickedpuppy	sorry i mixed something no deletion is to be made
2006-10-09T06:29:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	david83	ok ..
2006-10-09T06:29:00.000Z	david83	wickedpuppy	i just had 2 users and when i log in with the first one i get a gnome-panel error that the second user got a lock on it
2006-10-09T06:30:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	david83	type users ... how many names do you see ?
2006-10-09T06:30:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	david83	or who
2006-10-09T06:31:00.000Z	david83	wickedpuppy	the users aren't logged in at the same time
2006-10-09T06:32:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	david83	can't be ... you only see your name when you do who ?
2006-10-09T06:33:00.000Z	david83	wickedpuppy	i don't know for sure i am asking this for another person but he said that they weren't logged in at the same time
2006-10-09T06:34:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	david83	then ask him to do who .. at least come up with something .. we will see how things go
2006-10-09T06:34:00.000Z	david83	wickedpuppy	the two accounts were just sharing some files
2006-10-09T06:34:00.000Z	david83	wickedpuppy	ok thx
2006-10-09T06:35:00.000Z	david83	wickedpuppy	he wanted to check the symlinks so if anything is mixed up with them
2006-10-09T06:37:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	david83	really .. so does he have two users logged in or just one user ? and how do they share a file ?
2006-10-09T06:38:00.000Z	david83	wickedpuppy	sry he is still not chatting with me but i will ask him :) thx
