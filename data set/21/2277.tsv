2010-06-05T01:44:00.000Z	Eri1		Hello, trying for the third time in one hour here. After the automatic update of 10.04 (kernel + other stuff) the login screen disappeared and can't recall it back.  Tried to login with previous kernels, did updates, etc. but nothing works. If I run startx, the desktop will appear, but it's completely useless because it's keep jumping up and down and can't click anything anyway...
2010-06-05T01:44:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Eri1	did you remove gdm by any chance?
2010-06-05T01:46:00.000Z	Eri1	aeon-ltd	run sudo apt-get purge gdm and apt-get install gdm, but nothing happened
2010-06-05T01:47:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Eri1	you sadi startx shows a desktop but it flickers?
2010-06-05T01:47:00.000Z	Eri1	aeon-ltd	right, it flickers and bars are missing
2010-06-05T01:48:00.000Z	Eri1	aeon-ltd	what's a gpu?
2010-06-05T01:48:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Eri1	graphics processing unit, your graphics card basically
2010-06-05T01:49:00.000Z	Eri1	aeon-ltd	it's a laptop, Toshiba Satellite, no idea what GPU
2010-06-05T01:50:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Eri1	you might not have proper drivers, that would explain the 'bars' problem
2010-06-05T01:51:00.000Z	Eri1	aeon-ltd	it stopped working earlier today with the update...
2010-06-05T01:51:00.000Z	Eri1	aeon-ltd	how lont till the next update of kernel if that's the issue?
2010-06-05T01:52:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Eri1	i don't know
2010-06-05T01:52:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Eri1	were you using 'compiz' before?
2010-06-05T01:52:00.000Z	Eri1	aeon-ltd	sorry again, what's compiz?
2010-06-05T01:52:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Eri1	compositing could be causing the problem if not the drivers
2010-06-05T01:53:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Eri1	compositing manager, e.g. effects on the desktop
2010-06-05T01:53:00.000Z	Eri1	aeon-ltd	OK, I see. i guess I use the medium effects or something.
2010-06-05T01:54:00.000Z	Eri1	aeon-ltd	the issue is that the whole login screen disappeared...
2010-06-05T01:54:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Eri1	i know, but that could be a separate problem, multiple updates were applied so its hard to pinpoint the source
2010-06-05T01:56:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Eri1	you would have to downgrade all packages installed
2010-06-05T01:58:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Eri1	you would just remove, and installed a specific package (including version number)
