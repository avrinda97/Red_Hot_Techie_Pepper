2006-10-18T12:51:00.000Z	smotang		Anyone know how to unpack/run a bin file in ubuntu?
2006-10-18T12:51:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	smotang	sh file.bin
2006-10-18T12:52:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	smotang	You're welcome :)
2006-10-18T13:01:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	smotang	I figured you wouldn't be able to run it if sh file.bin didn't work. It doesn't mater if it isn't a shell script, sh file.bin should work if it's a bin file
2006-10-18T13:05:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	smotang	is it executable?
2006-10-18T13:05:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	smotang	ls Pla<tab><enter>
2006-10-18T13:05:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	smotang	It should say somethng like -rwxr-xr-x
2006-10-18T13:07:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	smotang	ok, that means it's executable. Perhaps the download was corrupted or something
2006-10-18T13:08:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	smotang	md5sum -c file.bin
2006-10-18T13:10:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	smotang	Does that match the md5sum on the app's website?
2006-10-18T13:15:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	smotang	You need to download the md5sum from the same website that you got planeshift from
2006-10-18T13:19:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	smotang	I am seeing that the md5sum is blank on the site :(
2006-10-18T13:22:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	smotang	You double-clicked it in nautilus and it worked?
2006-10-18T13:24:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	smotang	Nautilus manages the desktop ;)
2006-10-18T13:24:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	smotang	open a term and type:  gksudo nautilus  , then go to that file and double-click. But, be careful, that will be a nautilus window running as root.
2006-10-18T13:26:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	smotang	You're welcome :)
2006-10-18T13:27:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	smotang	exit/quit the app
2006-10-18T13:27:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	smotang	And make sure you close that nautilus window as well
2006-10-18T13:29:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	smotang	Check the topic about nvidia drivers
2006-10-18T13:31:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	smotang	type /topic
