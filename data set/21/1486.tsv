2010-08-26T13:45:00.000Z	KE1HA	fanjabi	 have you updated first with sudo apt-get update?
2010-08-26T13:47:00.000Z	fanjabi	KE1HA	yes
2010-08-26T13:47:00.000Z	KE1HA	fanjabi	 what package is it failing on ?
2010-08-26T13:47:00.000Z	fanjabi	KE1HA	any package
2010-08-26T13:48:00.000Z	fanjabi	KE1HA	i get an error even installing through software-center
2010-08-26T13:48:00.000Z	KE1HA	fanjabi	 from both command line and the package manager ?
2010-08-26T13:48:00.000Z	fanjabi	KE1HA	yes
2010-08-26T13:48:00.000Z	fanjabi	KE1HA	synaptic or software center
2010-08-26T13:49:00.000Z	KE1HA	fanjabi	 are you sure don't have a package process hung up in the background somewhere then?
2010-08-26T13:50:00.000Z	fanjabi	KE1HA	not sure, but i have restarted several times, but the problem remains
2010-08-26T13:52:00.000Z	fanjabi	KE1HA	yes, they install and run
2010-08-26T13:53:00.000Z	KE1HA	fanjabi	 aside form forcing the package ( which is normally not a good idea) then, update and try reinstall again, not sure where the issue could be. you could try cd /var/lib/dpkg/info  nd look for any bad packages and remove them, but that can be dangerous.
2010-08-26T13:56:00.000Z	KE1HA	fanjabi	 calso look at cleaning out /var/cache/apt/archives  then make a /partial dir and update again, sometimes things get hung on the cache, but that's a long shot.
2010-08-26T13:58:00.000Z	KE1HA	fanjabi	 put the output here in pastebin: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/
2010-08-26T14:00:00.000Z	KE1HA	fanjabi	 also, do you use Tex fer writing docs with? you can remove them, and redo the updates and re-install Tex again after.
2010-08-26T14:07:00.000Z	KE1HA	fanjabi	 you get you probem sorted ?
2010-08-26T14:08:00.000Z	KE1HA	fanjabi	 well done !
2010-08-26T14:09:00.000Z	KE1HA	fanjabi	 same problem is back ?
2010-08-26T14:24:00.000Z	KE1HA	fanjabi	 wiht the issues you had in upgrading, you may consider un-installing one player, then re-installing it again to test one of them.
2010-08-26T14:26:00.000Z	fanjabi	KE1HA	tried this already... no result
