2012-04-15T10:46:00.000Z	shape	rdw200169	it's the default gnome-disk-utility that comes with both systems
2012-04-15T10:51:00.000Z	rdw200169	shape	yeah, don't trust the drive, start making backups now
2012-04-15T10:52:00.000Z	rdw200169	shape	prices are so low these days, its silly to think you should keep that around
2012-04-15T10:52:00.000Z	rdw200169	shape	when its throwing errors; *trust* me on this one
2012-04-15T10:54:00.000Z	shape	rdw200169	The funny thing is it has 5 years warranty from seagate and I've only used it for 300 days.
2012-04-15T10:54:00.000Z	shape	rdw200169	And my 6 year old seagate that is 80GB that I have the system on has no bad sectors.
2012-04-15T10:55:00.000Z	rdw200169	shape	then get a new drive ASAP, migrate the stuff you want to keep (or two and setup a raid) and rma the old one
2012-04-15T10:56:00.000Z	rdw200169	shape	I RMA a commodity drive about once a week at work ;)
2012-04-15T10:56:00.000Z	shape	rdw200169	Yes, of course. I just have to wait 2 weeks for my paycheck. The thing is this drive is supposed to be the backup one! LOL
2012-04-15T10:57:00.000Z	shape	rdw200169	But yean thanks for the tip. I am actually interested. How come ubuntu doesn't alert me, and how can I set the threshold so that it's like in Fedora
2012-04-15T10:58:00.000Z	rdw200169	shape	thats a good question ;) I don't have the answer b/c I don't use gui tools
2012-04-15T10:58:00.000Z	shape	rdw200169	Then do you have a link to provide me with documentation regarding terminal commands about that?
2012-04-15T11:00:00.000Z	shape	rdw200169	you mean "shape"
2012-04-15T11:00:00.000Z	rdw200169	shape	yup, sorry ;)
2012-04-15T11:00:00.000Z	shape	rdw200169	Also, what is the maximum bad sector number that makes a HDD bad/and should be replaced
2012-04-15T11:02:00.000Z	rdw200169	shape	how much are you willing to lose?  I'll give you a good piece of advice: never ever ever ever trust a hard drive; its a spinning magnetic disk platter thing!  This is why RAID is so important ;)
2012-04-15T11:03:00.000Z	shape	rdw200169	Yes, but what if I buy an external one and just back up once in a while. Skipping RAID.
2012-04-15T11:04:00.000Z	shape	rdw200169	That should be good enough, right? I don't really have important data, in case all die. Just media and stuff.
2012-04-15T11:04:00.000Z	shape	rdw200169	 Thanks for the link and for your help btw. I will brb for a few minutes.
2012-04-15T11:04:00.000Z	rdw200169	shape	no prob
