2007-06-07T08:44:00.000Z	cas3		do I actually need to recompile my kernel to install lirc?
2007-06-07T08:46:00.000Z	cas3		broadcom sux
2007-06-07T08:47:00.000Z	cas3		if you use ndiswrapper it will
2007-06-07T08:47:00.000Z	cas3		but I'd rather just get a card
2007-06-07T08:48:00.000Z	cas3		darkrift I think you can use windows drivers too
2007-06-07T08:48:00.000Z	cas3		*shrug*
2007-06-07T08:49:00.000Z	cas3		do I have to recompile a kernel to get lircd working? or can I just use the daemon?
2007-06-07T08:50:00.000Z	cas3		broadcom needs to recognize the linux community
2007-06-07T08:51:00.000Z	bruenig	cas3	1% of market share, eh
2007-06-07T08:52:00.000Z	cas3	bruenig	yeah but linux is standardization, while proprietary isnt
2007-06-07T08:53:00.000Z	bruenig	cas3	still no payoff
2007-06-07T08:53:00.000Z	cas3	bruenig	more people able to use your products = more sales
2007-06-07T08:54:00.000Z	bruenig	cas3	but the amount of people able to use it doesn't make any impact.
2007-06-07T08:54:00.000Z	bruenig	cas3	amount of new people*
2007-06-07T08:58:00.000Z	cas3	bruenig	that doesnt make sense to me, if more people can use it than more people would buy broadcom.  If you can't use it, you wouldn't buy it. I wouldn't buy a laptop that had a broadcom chip, just because I couldn't use it. Or if I couldn't use google then they arent meeting their potential revenue
2007-06-07T08:59:00.000Z	bruenig	cas3	right but it is like handicap people, if you made ramps to your store, more handicap people would use it right? But the number of handicap people is not large enough to justify the money or effort it would take to do that. Which is why in US, you have to force them to do it with the American with Disabilities Act.
2007-06-07T09:07:00.000Z	cas3	bruenig	your right the initial funds will be costly, but the reward pays itself off after time. How much is the 1% worth after the accumulation of time. Good point though, but the US also has to force companies to hire minorities too. How much money does that 1% generate anyways? Because most linux-zealots I know like to buy all kinds of gadgets
2007-06-07T09:09:00.000Z	bruenig	cas3	the hire minorities things is irrelevant. My point was that if it were financially better for them to, they would. That is capitalism. Perhaps not all companies are completey effecient, but the ones who aren't get weeded out. Just like handicap people, if it were truly helpful, they would.
2007-06-07T09:12:00.000Z	cas3	bruenig	I'm just saying they're not capitalist enough :)
2007-06-07T09:14:00.000Z	bruenig	cas3	if we get bigger they will. I always make sure all my stuff is compatible. The only problem is that most linux users are switchers. They have a computer first, learn of linux and decide to put it on. But they have already bought the hardware. Perhaps down the line if you have initial linux users getting new computers and laptops it will become more apparent.
2007-06-07T09:17:00.000Z	cas3	bruenig	yeah but those people calling you an idiot will make your program soo much better
