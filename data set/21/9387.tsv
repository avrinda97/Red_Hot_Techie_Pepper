2005-09-30T07:10:00.000Z	LuVUnTu		could anyone help me figure out a way to get pon dsl-provider on my bootup?
2005-09-30T07:10:00.000Z	dooglus	LuVUnTu	you want to run a script when you boot?
2005-09-30T07:10:00.000Z	dooglus	LuVUnTu	put it at the end of /etc/init.d/bootmisc.sh
2005-09-30T07:14:00.000Z	LuVUnTu	dooglus	egad ... i know it's before the exit but all them ifs and fs got me confused could ya gimme a hand?
2005-09-30T07:14:00.000Z	dooglus	LuVUnTu	stick it right at the end if you like
2005-09-30T07:14:00.000Z	dooglus	LuVUnTu	that's not really an exit, it's a ": exit", isn't it?
2005-09-30T07:15:00.000Z	dooglus	LuVUnTu	sure, if that's the line you want to run
2005-09-30T07:15:00.000Z	LuVUnTu	dooglus	yeah yer right
2005-09-30T07:15:00.000Z	dooglus	LuVUnTu	I've no idea why that ": exit" is there.  : doesn't do anything
2005-09-30T07:16:00.000Z	LuVUnTu	dooglus	prolly just a post sign for us dummies
2005-09-30T07:21:00.000Z	LuVUnTu	dooglus	that werk ... great coach.
2005-09-30T07:23:00.000Z	dooglus	LuVUnTu	thanks
2005-09-30T08:24:00.000Z	LuVUnTu	dooglus	i learn that last night .... ctrl + l
2005-09-30T08:27:00.000Z	LuVUnTu	dooglus	can u like toggle the location bar mode?
2005-09-30T08:29:00.000Z	dooglus	LuVUnTu	I've no idea.  I'd like to know, but don't know how to find out.  the man page for nautilus is tiny, and the on-line help doesn't seem to be searchable
2005-09-30T08:30:00.000Z	LuVUnTu	dooglus	well i thought i'd ask ... thanks anyway
2005-09-30T08:42:00.000Z	dooglus	LuVUnTu	the only way I can find to toggle the location bar mode is using the configuration editor, as I described above.
2005-09-30T08:49:00.000Z	LuVUnTu	dooglus	yeap one of u good fellas showed that to me last night
2005-10-05T10:31:00.000Z	LuVUnTu	dooglus	which file was it again that i should add the line <code>pon adsl-provide</code>
2005-10-05T10:32:00.000Z	dooglus	LuVUnTu	I think you've got the wrong person
2005-10-05T10:32:00.000Z	dooglus	LuVUnTu	oh no, I remember you...  /etc/init.d/bootmisc.sh
