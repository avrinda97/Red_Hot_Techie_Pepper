2009-05-19T05:29:00.000Z	taget_	mindrape	i would like to know how to do either :)
2009-05-19T05:15:00.000Z	mindrape	taget_	throw it in the end of /etc/rc.local
2009-05-19T05:15:00.000Z	taget_	mindrape	just the command itself or a link to the script
2009-05-19T05:16:00.000Z	mindrape	taget_	whichever you prefer... not sure how you manage your system.  It's called at the end of each runlevel so it will get called 1 way or another.
2009-05-19T05:16:00.000Z	taget_	mindrape	aye thanks i ll give it a shot
2009-05-19T05:28:00.000Z	taget_	mindrape	i tired adding that to the end of the start file like you described but it did not work.? any other suggestions. the program i am tryin to launch is mp3blaster with a specific playlist. is there a certain runlevel it should be on ?
2009-05-19T05:28:00.000Z	mindrape	taget_	oh... its going to launch it in console only... you want to launch it after you get into your session from GDM?
2009-05-19T05:28:00.000Z	mindrape	taget_	there will be a different place to put it... hold..  lemme look.
2009-05-19T05:30:00.000Z	mindrape	taget_	if you load something from rc.local and want it to attach to a screen you have to issue -display 0:0 after it
2009-05-19T05:30:00.000Z	mindrape	taget_	unfortunately you wont have instantiated a screen yet because you'll be sitting at gdm by the time rc.local runs
2009-05-19T05:31:00.000Z	taget_	mindrape	hmm, mp3blaster is a cli audio player, would it sill need to be attached to a screen ?
2009-05-19T05:32:00.000Z	mindrape	taget_	oh, nevermind... hrrmmm... well it may have abend'ed... no process for mp3blaster is running?
2009-05-19T05:33:00.000Z	taget_	mindrape	its on tty8
2009-05-19T05:33:00.000Z	mindrape	taget_	strange... when you invoked it did you detach it using &?
2009-05-19T05:33:00.000Z	taget_	mindrape	im not sure what you mean ?
2009-05-19T05:34:00.000Z	mindrape	taget_	mp3blaster -play myfile.mp3 etc &
2009-05-19T05:34:00.000Z	taget_	mindrape	no its jsut mp3blaster -a playlist.lst
2009-05-19T05:34:00.000Z	taget_	mindrape	for now
2009-05-19T05:35:00.000Z	mindrape	taget_	lemme test on my laptop real fast... I'll stop guessing.  ;)
2009-05-19T05:35:00.000Z	taget_	mindrape	thanks for the help :)
