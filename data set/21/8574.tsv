2006-03-14T08:03:00.000Z	Paedrigh		I've got a problem with my internet/Lan connection. Tried to change IP-Gateway-Subnet in network settings, seemed fine, but when doing ifconfig it didn't match up at all. Anyone up for helping?
2006-03-14T08:04:00.000Z	soundray	Paedrigh	try 'ifup eth0' or whatever device you changed, then ifconfig
2006-03-14T08:05:00.000Z	soundray	Paedrigh	yes.
2006-03-14T08:06:00.000Z	Paedrigh	soundray	I tried that, but nothing really happened
2006-03-14T08:07:00.000Z	soundray	Paedrigh	no errors?
2006-03-14T08:09:00.000Z	soundray	Paedrigh	hold on...
2006-03-14T08:10:00.000Z	soundray	Paedrigh	try 'sudo ifdown eth0 ; sudo ifup eth0', then check with ifconfig again.
2006-03-14T08:11:00.000Z	soundray	Paedrigh	no, but other people will be able to help.
2006-03-14T08:49:00.000Z	Paedrigh	soundray	I did the changes with the IP and everything, and checked ifconfig. It worked. But after about ten seconds it reverted back again
2006-03-14T08:50:00.000Z	soundray	Paedrigh	have you tried configuring via System-Admin-Networking?
2006-03-14T08:54:00.000Z	soundray	Paedrigh	that's really strange. Is dhclient running?
2006-03-14T08:57:00.000Z	Paedrigh	soundray	I don't know, I'm such a nwbie
2006-03-14T09:02:00.000Z	soundray	Paedrigh	what live version do you have?
2006-03-14T09:02:00.000Z	Paedrigh	soundray	the one from yesterday
2006-03-14T09:03:00.000Z	soundray	Paedrigh	I reckon you've found a bug, then.
2006-03-14T09:06:00.000Z	soundray	Paedrigh	are you evaluating Ubuntu for possible production use? If you do, I would go for a breezy live CD.
2006-03-14T09:08:00.000Z	Paedrigh	soundray	Nah, not really. I'm evaluating to see if it would be possible for me to leave windows behind. The goal is to learn enough about the system so that I eventually can persuade the school where I work to go opensource and leave microsoft behind
2006-03-14T09:09:00.000Z	soundray	Paedrigh	wow, there's something at stake here!
2006-03-14T09:09:00.000Z	Paedrigh	soundray	it's not a very big school....
2006-03-14T09:09:00.000Z	soundray	Paedrigh	for that kind of thorough evaluation, I would recommend a hard disk install, though.
2006-03-14T09:10:00.000Z	Paedrigh	soundray	I suppose you are right.
