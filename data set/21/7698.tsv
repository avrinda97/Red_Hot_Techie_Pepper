2008-08-16T13:06:00.000Z	dorito		anyone could tell me why do i keep getting the message make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop. everytime I try to install xchat or any other program
2008-08-16T13:07:00.000Z	dorito		is there a gtk package or something you have to install in order to make the OS recognize the 'make' function?
2008-08-16T13:07:00.000Z	dorito		please.
2008-08-16T13:07:00.000Z	dorito		pretty with sugar on top :)
2008-08-16T13:08:00.000Z	dorito		no but I ran the update
2008-08-16T13:08:00.000Z	Igramul	dorito	Apparently, You are calling make from the wrong directory.
2008-08-16T13:08:00.000Z	dorito		no
2008-08-16T13:08:00.000Z	dorito		I double checked
2008-08-16T13:08:00.000Z	dorito		I even copied the directory into another location
2008-08-16T13:09:00.000Z	Igramul	dorito	Does it contain a file named Makefile?
2008-08-16T13:09:00.000Z	dorito	Igramul	sec.
2008-08-16T13:09:00.000Z	Igramul	dorito	However, using make is not the recommended way to install software for ubuntu. Try using "apt-get".
2008-08-16T13:09:00.000Z	dorito		yeah
2008-08-16T13:09:00.000Z	dorito		makefile.am
2008-08-16T13:10:00.000Z	dorito		its in the folder
2008-08-16T13:10:00.000Z	Igramul	dorito	Wrong one.
2008-08-16T13:10:00.000Z	Igramul	dorito	That's for a tool called "automake". I'm no expert with that one...
2008-08-16T13:10:00.000Z	dorito		theres only two makefile files makefile.am and makefile.in
2008-08-16T13:11:00.000Z	dorito		I downloaded two packages from xchat's sourceforge page and tried with them both
2008-08-16T13:11:00.000Z	dorito		none seem to recognize the command make after ./configure
2008-08-16T13:11:00.000Z	Igramul	dorito	Why don't You run "apt-get install xchat" ?
