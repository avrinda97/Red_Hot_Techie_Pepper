2010-10-11T00:09:00.000Z	war59312		omg i figured it out whooooooooooooo
2010-10-11T00:09:00.000Z	Mathuin	war59312	share!
2010-10-11T00:09:00.000Z	war59312	Mathuin	i was able to change visual effects from non to normal
2010-10-11T00:09:00.000Z	Mathuin	war59312	nice!  proprietary drivers?
2010-10-11T00:09:00.000Z	war59312	Mathuin	and changed theme to human
2010-10-11T00:10:00.000Z	war59312	Mathuin	And now no more crazy blinking screen and able to pull up the config grub screen and continue install. :D
2010-10-11T00:11:00.000Z	war59312	Mathuin	Nope using nvidia driver that comes with "Additional Drivers"
2010-10-11T00:11:00.000Z	Mathuin	war59312	huh, I thought that was a proprietary driver.  It's the one I was using,a nd it did work very well.
2010-10-11T00:12:00.000Z	war59312	Mathuin	Well it seems there is some bug with it if you have an nvidia 8600m gs grahpics card.
2010-10-11T00:13:00.000Z	war59312	Mathuin	oh well its all good now.. :) SImple enough workground.. hehe
2010-10-11T00:13:00.000Z	Mathuin	war59312	have you tried the high-quality effects?
2010-10-11T00:13:00.000Z	war59312	Mathuin	Install is continuing just fine now..
2010-10-11T00:14:00.000Z	war59312	Mathuin	Just switched to "Extra" and all good. :)
2010-10-11T00:14:00.000Z	war59312	Mathuin	And yes the effects are working fine.
2010-10-11T00:14:00.000Z	Mathuin	war59312	I like the extra effects, they're worth the effort.
2010-10-11T00:14:00.000Z	war59312	Mathuin	Now I go back to normal and crazy flashing screen again, 4 times per second.
2010-10-11T00:15:00.000Z	war59312	Mathuin	I perfer no effects myself and was working fine before the installer started.. Very odd bug..
2010-10-11T00:15:00.000Z	war59312	Mathuin	I just hope the None option works again after upgrade finishes...
2010-10-11T00:16:00.000Z	Mathuin	war59312	I downgraded to 'none' in 10.04 with no trouble while diagnosing an unrelated issue, I imagine it'll dot he right thing in 10.10.
2010-10-11T00:16:00.000Z	war59312	Mathuin	I pray it does.. ;)
2010-10-11T00:39:00.000Z	Mathuin	war59312	good luck!!
