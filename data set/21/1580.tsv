2010-07-18T21:48:00.000Z	teemo		ok, i really failed
2010-07-18T21:49:00.000Z	teemo		i dont know how to get my wireless usb adapter recognized on ubuntu, i dont know how to install the device manager so i cant even get info about what is going on
2010-07-18T21:49:00.000Z	teemo		can someone plzzzz point me to where to download the device manager
2010-07-18T21:51:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	teemo	there is no "device manager" in linux.  running the command "lspci | grep net" in a terminal might show you the network cards the kernel sees.  good luck.
2010-07-18T22:07:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	teemo	do you have internet otherwise?
2010-07-18T21:58:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	teemo	what version of ubuntu are you using?  10.04?
2010-07-18T21:59:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	teemo	can you open a terminal and run "lsb_release -a"
2010-07-18T22:04:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	teemo	sorry phone call.  in the terminal run "apt-cache policy gnome-device-manager" and see what it shows.
2010-07-18T22:05:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	teemo	also open System / Admin / Software Sources.  type password.  and verify the entry ending in (universe) is selected.
2010-07-18T22:06:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	teemo	actually is everything selected?
2010-07-18T22:06:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	teemo	that's fine.
2010-07-18T22:06:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	teemo	in a terminal "sudo apt-get update"
2010-07-18T22:08:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	teemo	reopen Software Sources and try changing the mirror (Download from: dropdown)
2010-07-18T22:08:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	teemo	agree to reload after change
2010-07-18T22:09:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	teemo	try rerunning "sudo apg-get update" in terminal.
2010-07-18T22:09:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	teemo	is it only one that is failing.  or everything?
2010-07-18T22:10:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	teemo	ok - you should probably update your system now!  might take a while though.  what was your origional issue again?  wireless?
2010-07-18T22:11:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	teemo	check hardware drivers and see if your wireless is currently listed.
2010-07-18T22:11:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	teemo	system / admin / hardware driver
2010-07-18T22:13:00.000Z	teemo	ZykoticK9	im checking for updates now
