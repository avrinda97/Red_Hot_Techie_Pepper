2009-06-07T17:36:00.000Z	dakarn		!autorun
2009-06-07T17:37:00.000Z	_dr	dakarn	the installation script put the files into /etc/rc*.d/
2009-06-07T17:37:00.000Z	_dr		shouldn't that work already?
2009-06-07T17:37:00.000Z	dakarn	_dr	System > Preferences > Sessions > Startup Programs
2009-06-07T17:38:00.000Z	dakarn	_dr	i don't use gnome but autorun.rc is how i load startups
2009-06-07T17:39:00.000Z	_dr	dakarn	well, the thing is i'n used to bsd rc startup scripts
2009-06-07T17:40:00.000Z	_dr		linux has this /etc/rc* stuff i'm not familiar with but after reading the documentation i thought putting it in rc2.d would work
2009-06-07T17:40:00.000Z	_dr		since 2 is the default runlevel
2009-06-07T17:40:00.000Z	dakarn	_dr	you're using ubuntu with gnome wm, correct?
2009-06-07T17:40:00.000Z	_dr	dakarn	yes, but the system startup scripts don't have anything to do with my WM, or not?
2009-06-07T17:41:00.000Z	dakarn	_dr	depends on when you want them to load
2009-06-07T17:42:00.000Z	_dr	dakarn	hum... ok
2009-06-07T17:42:00.000Z	_dr		lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 13 2009-06-06 17:53 /etc/rc2.d/S99tpb -> ../init.d/tpb
2009-06-07T17:42:00.000Z	_dr		shouldn't that work?
2009-06-07T17:44:00.000Z	dakarn	_dr	there is ~/.gnome2/session where you can add it, or you can add it to xsession
2009-06-07T17:44:00.000Z	dakarn	_dr	there's also ~/.config/autostart
2009-06-07T17:45:00.000Z	_dr	dakarn	i know what you mean, but i don't really think it's supposed to work that way
2009-06-07T17:45:00.000Z	dakarn		zubuntuX: enable restricted repositories in synaptic
2009-06-07T17:46:00.000Z	_dr		since the installer script populated /etc/init.d
2009-06-07T17:46:00.000Z	_dr		you don't run inetd from your gnome login session either, you know what i mean
2009-06-07T17:53:00.000Z	dakarn	_dr	did you check to see if it worked from the install?
