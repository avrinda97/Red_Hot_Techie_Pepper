2012-09-04T20:24:00.000Z	Ephexeve		hey guys, question, I have a network driver Realtek 8139/8139C/8139C+ which contains also a wireless. I am not managing to get the driver working. Any one knows a fix for this?
2012-09-04T20:24:00.000Z	usr13	Ephexeve	Are you sure?  What does iwconfig say?
2012-09-04T20:25:00.000Z	usr13	Ephexeve	lspci |grep ireless  #Tell us what that says.
2012-09-04T20:27:00.000Z	Ephexeve	usr13	Nothing
2012-09-04T20:27:00.000Z	usr13	Ephexeve	Is this a laptop or desktop?
2012-09-04T20:27:00.000Z	Ephexeve	usr13	laptop
2012-09-04T20:28:00.000Z	usr13	Ephexeve	Do you have the hardware switch toggled off?
2012-09-04T20:28:00.000Z	Ephexeve	usr13	It's on
2012-09-04T20:29:00.000Z	usr13	Ephexeve	lspci #look for the line that describes the Wireless device, show us.
2012-09-04T20:31:00.000Z	usr13	Ephexeve	What version of Ubuntu do you have installed?  lsb_release -a
2012-09-04T20:31:00.000Z	Ephexeve	usr13	there is nothing that says wireless. that's the problem
2012-09-04T20:31:00.000Z	Ephexeve	usr13	12.04 LTS
2012-09-04T20:32:00.000Z	usr13	Ephexeve	Yep sure is.  Are you sure the hardware switch is not toggled off?  May also need to look at the BIOS settings.
2012-09-04T20:32:00.000Z	Ephexeve	usr13	Yeps, all on, even the led is on
2012-09-04T20:32:00.000Z	usr13	Ephexeve	Software Modem would indicate a DialUp modem.
2012-09-04T20:33:00.000Z	usr13	Ephexeve	What do you see in the network manager?
2012-09-04T20:33:00.000Z	Ephexeve	usr13	Wired connection only
2012-09-04T20:33:00.000Z	usr13	Ephexeve	That's interesting.  Is this system fully updated?
2012-09-04T20:33:00.000Z	Ephexeve	usr13	Yes
2012-09-04T20:35:00.000Z	usr13	Ephexeve	Do you still have the LiveCD or USB that you installed with?  If so, boot to it and see if it works there.
2012-09-04T20:36:00.000Z	usr13	Ephexeve	I just don't know.  It's beyond me.  Maybe someone else will have something more.
