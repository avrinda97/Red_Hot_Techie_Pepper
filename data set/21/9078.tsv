2005-12-06T14:00:00.000Z	Seveas	oskude	and by that make a lot of things bork...
2005-12-06T14:01:00.000Z	oskude	Seveas	well, he wanted it so :)
2005-12-06T14:03:00.000Z	oskude	Seveas	if you mean my method brakes his system, please tell him a better one...
2005-12-06T14:03:00.000Z	Seveas	oskude	./configure --prefix=/usr/local
2005-12-06T14:04:00.000Z	oskude	Seveas	he has a binary version
2005-12-06T14:05:00.000Z	oskude	Seveas	but then again, would it be enough if the path to the new firefox is before the old (in $PATH) ?
2005-12-06T14:06:00.000Z	Seveas	oskude	yes
2005-12-06T14:06:00.000Z	oskude	Seveas	roger, thnx :)
2005-12-06T14:08:00.000Z	oskude	Seveas	another quick question, what would be the best place to make a constant change in $PATH variable ?
2005-12-16T17:36:00.000Z	Seveas	oskude	write it down on the wiki :)
2005-12-16T17:37:00.000Z	oskude	Seveas	yup, but i need complete list of depencies and im too lazy to wipe my system :) (didnt log my doings so well ;)
2006-06-19T10:37:00.000Z	Seveas	oskude	sure it's known. Doesn't mean it's fixed 
2006-09-28T11:22:00.000Z	Seveas	oskude	using the gtk-qt-engine
2006-09-28T11:22:00.000Z	oskude	Seveas	just apt-get that ?
2006-09-28T11:22:00.000Z	Seveas	oskude	first find the correct name, but yeah
2006-09-28T11:23:00.000Z	oskude	Seveas	roger, thanks!
2006-09-28T11:33:00.000Z	oskude	Seveas	hmm, i can only find "gtk2-engines-gtk-qt - theme engine using Qt for GTK+ 2.x" but i actually wanted "gtk look for qt", but cant find anything with apt-cache search...
2006-09-28T11:34:00.000Z	Seveas	oskude	ah ok, then I misunderstood you -- unfortunately there is no such thing yet
2006-09-28T11:34:00.000Z	oskude	Seveas	roger
2006-10-08T07:59:00.000Z	Seveas	oskude	?
2006-10-09T16:43:00.000Z	oskude	Seveas	maybe someone should change all occurances of !foobar to /msg ubotu foobar in the factoids...
