2004-12-30T08:34:00.000Z	Pozac		I miss the compiling sometimes though
2004-12-30T08:35:00.000Z	Pozac		root__: You should log in as a user.

2004-12-30T08:37:00.000Z	Pozac		rturner: Much better. :)
2004-12-30T08:37:00.000Z	Pozac		It's known
2004-12-30T08:37:00.000Z	rturner	Pozac	, thanks for the root tip off :)
2004-12-30T08:38:00.000Z	rturner	Pozac	, thanks
2004-12-30T08:38:00.000Z	Pozac	rturner	I'm also IRC'ing in text mode because of this. ;)
2004-12-30T08:39:00.000Z	Pozac	rturner	It should be possible to install the previous version, if you're impatient.
2004-12-30T08:40:00.000Z	rturner	Pozac	, there's something very minamalist and satisfying about text mode :)
2004-12-30T08:41:00.000Z	rturner	Pozac	 what does that mean?
2004-12-30T08:41:00.000Z	Pozac	rturner	Indeed. Also, bitchX is very oldschool. :)
2004-12-30T08:41:00.000Z	Pozac	rturner	I was recommended irssi-text
2004-12-30T08:42:00.000Z	rturner	Pozac	: it was the only one i could remember offhand, has a very memorable name
2004-12-30T08:42:00.000Z	Pozac	rturner	lol, yeah. And a cool icon, if you've seen that.
2004-12-30T08:42:00.000Z	rturner	Pozac	, so what's the state of the art in irc clients, usually when i have X i use xchat?
2004-12-30T08:43:00.000Z	Pozac	rturner	I use xchat too, or Gaim, when I'm the gay-smiley-acceptance-mood.
2004-12-30T08:45:00.000Z	Pozac	rturner	irssi is quite cool, actually. Might try the X version, when I get my X back.
2004-12-30T08:45:00.000Z	rturner	Pozac	, I'll remember the name, I'm not a big irc user tho
2004-12-30T08:46:00.000Z	rturner	Pozac	only when the system fries :)
2004-12-30T09:02:00.000Z	Pozac	rturner	yup
