2009-07-20T21:57:00.000Z	moltenbobcat	blackxored	vmware has a utility called vmware converter that is free
2009-07-20T21:57:00.000Z	moltenbobcat	blackxored	but it of course converts it into a .vmdk file which shouldn't be an issue unless you aren't using vmware
2009-07-20T21:58:00.000Z	blackxored	moltenbobcat	what I actually meant was Virtual to Physical
2009-07-20T21:59:00.000Z	blackxored	moltenbobcat	actually, I'm trying a vdi mounter for virtual box and maybe remastersys by now, I was seeking for other ways
2009-07-20T22:00:00.000Z	moltenbobcat	blackxored	I see you could use regular imaging software
2009-07-20T22:00:00.000Z	moltenbobcat		like clonezilla
2009-07-20T22:00:00.000Z	moltenbobcat		and dump it to a network location
2009-07-20T22:01:00.000Z	moltenbobcat		restore from that image on the physical machine
2009-07-20T22:01:00.000Z	blackxored	moltenbobcat	ok, let me try to follow you and explain myself better
2009-07-20T22:02:00.000Z	blackxored	moltenbobcat	I normally set up virtual appliance using turnkey-core as a basis, then I install my custom software and deploy it, but at work I need to make them on physical machines. I'm running virtualbox-ose, on a ubuntu host
2009-07-20T22:03:00.000Z	moltenbobcat	blackxored	ok, so grab an iso of some linux based drive imaging software and set that as the iso associated with the guest in virtualbox boot of of that mount some type of network share or maybe you could even use a usb drive
2009-07-20T22:03:00.000Z	moltenbobcat	blackxored	then image to that network location... then you have an image file that you can then restore to a physical machine
2009-07-20T22:05:00.000Z	blackxored	moltenbobcat	ok, actually there's no need for usb drivers, I've setup NAT, remember it was network-based appliances, sorry not to mention, I'm a netadmin, so actually I need to use a "imaging" software, isn't dd just good enough? recommendations?
2009-07-20T22:06:00.000Z	moltenbobcat	blackxored	 yeah dd will work fine, wasn't sure if these were windows guests or not.  If that was the case then dd could be an issue.  If it's all linux then you should be good
2009-07-20T22:07:00.000Z	moltenbobcat	blackxored	clonezilla will compress aucomatically
2009-07-20T22:07:00.000Z	moltenbobcat		dd will be a raw image and take up more space
2009-07-20T22:07:00.000Z	moltenbobcat		you could compress it after the fact of course
2009-07-20T22:08:00.000Z	blackxored	moltenbobcat	ok I'll give it a try I think, how to restore it, then?
2009-07-20T22:11:00.000Z	moltenbobcat	blackxored	same deal just boot a physical clonezilla livecd on the physical box
2009-07-20T22:11:00.000Z	moltenbobcat		and make sure you have the images that it created available
2009-07-20T22:12:00.000Z	blackxored	moltenbobcat	fine then ggl in it
