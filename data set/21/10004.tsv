2008-10-15T16:28:00.000Z	wp		If i want to write "year" into a new document like ("year" >> year.txt) how do I do that?
2008-10-15T16:28:00.000Z	wp		from the terminal of course
2008-10-15T16:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	wp	 echo year >> year.txt
2008-10-15T16:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	wp	 you may want to read a few bash starter guides. :)
2008-10-15T16:29:00.000Z	wp	dr_willis	thank you.... I have done that... just ages since i used echo and forgot about it ;)
2008-10-15T16:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	wp	 echo is handy. :) with wildcards its even handier.. :) try 'echo *' some day for a cheap mans  'ls'
2008-10-15T16:32:00.000Z	wp	dr_willis	ahhh... he he... how do I use tabulator in echo??
2008-10-15T16:32:00.000Z	dr_willis	wp	 Huh?
2008-10-15T16:33:00.000Z	wp	dr_willis	the button with the 2 arrows pointing in oposit direction
2008-10-15T16:33:00.000Z	dr_willis	wp	 you mean the Tab Key?
2008-10-15T16:33:00.000Z	wp	dr_willis	yep
2008-10-15T16:33:00.000Z	dr_willis	wp	 the tab charcter is control-t if i rember properly. and theres some special way you can 'echo' it to a file.. if thats what you are asking.
2008-10-15T16:34:00.000Z	wp	dr_willis	I want to echo it, yes...
2008-10-15T16:34:00.000Z	dr_willis	wp	 time to check bash guides for printing  'whitespace'  charcters I think. :) i dont recall how.  you could set the tab character ins ome variable then echo the variable.
2008-10-15T16:36:00.000Z	wp	dr_willis	I found it \t horisontial tab :D
2008-10-15T16:42:00.000Z	wp	dr_willis	I found out that horizontal tab is \t, but when I write \t ino my echo command it ignores \t??
2008-10-15T16:44:00.000Z	dr_willis	wp	 \t is special formating used in special cases..  its an excape character.
2008-10-15T16:44:00.000Z	dr_willis	wp	 you could combine what jrib just said and do a  echo -e "\t\  > some sort of variable. then just echo the $VARIABLE
2008-10-15T16:44:00.000Z	dr_willis	wp	 i belive the advanced bash scripting guide gives examples of this with whitespace and color codes
2008-10-15T16:44:00.000Z	wp	dr_willis	I found out that horizontal tab is \t, but when I write \t ino my echo command it ignores \t??
2008-10-15T16:44:00.000Z	wp	dr_willis	ups.... I write echo -e Trækølle\t1H\t1T6\t1\tL\t1\t2\t7 >> Trækølle.txt
