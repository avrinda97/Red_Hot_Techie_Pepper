2008-12-30T01:01:00.000Z	williammanda_		anyone else have any ideas on the problem executing the bin file?
2008-12-30T01:03:00.000Z	Slart	williammanda_	what's the problem? can't execute it? error messages?
2008-12-30T01:04:00.000Z	Slart	williammanda_	it's not ECS.bin or Ecs.bin? linux is case sensitive
2008-12-30T01:05:00.000Z	Slart	williammanda_	can you do a pastebin with the output from "ls -l" <-- that's an lower case L and from "./ecs.bin"
2008-12-30T01:05:00.000Z	williammanda_	Slart	 william@CQD:~/ecs$ ls ecs.bin     ecs.bin
2008-12-30T01:05:00.000Z	Slart	williammanda_	pay attention.. the output from ls -l

2008-12-30T01:08:00.000Z	Slart	williammanda_	thanks.. I'll take a look
2008-12-30T01:08:00.000Z	williammanda_	Slart	ty
2008-12-30T01:13:00.000Z	Slart	williammanda_	hmm... everything looks alright..  sure it's not just a silly typo or something? where is this file located? some weird external drive? ntfs-drive?
2008-12-30T01:14:00.000Z	williammanda_	Slart	http://pastebin.com/d6c606e80 .....more info
2008-12-30T01:19:00.000Z	Slart	williammanda_	very strange.. there must be something obvious we're missing here..
2008-12-30T01:19:00.000Z	williammanda_	Slart	yes I agree
2008-12-30T01:31:00.000Z	williammanda_	Slart	more info http://pastebin.com/d4a4e3a6e
2008-12-30T01:32:00.000Z	Slart	williammanda_	can you run "file ecs.bin" ?
2008-12-30T01:37:00.000Z	Slart	williammanda_	perhaps you should run a fsck on the hard drive
2008-12-30T01:38:00.000Z	Slart	williammanda_	yes.. since you can see the file with ls but not run it or get info about it
2008-12-30T01:39:00.000Z	williammanda_	Slart	just fsck or e2fsack /devsda1?
2008-12-30T01:39:00.000Z	Slart	williammanda_	I think fsck just runs the second command so it wouldn't really matter which one you use
2008-12-30T01:39:00.000Z	williammanda_	Slart	ty
2008-12-30T01:40:00.000Z	Slart	williammanda_	you're welcome
