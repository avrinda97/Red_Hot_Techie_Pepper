2007-03-28T09:30:00.000Z	dan20		When I try to install from the 6.10 live CD, rather than booting into gnome for the install (like it used to on my 6.06 lts disk), I just get a blank screen and nothing happens.
2007-03-28T09:31:00.000Z	Panzor	dan20	do you have it booting off of your CD-ROM?
2007-03-28T09:32:00.000Z	dan20	Panzor	 Yeah, it brings up the list of ways to install, then when I select Install Ubuntu (and it would normally go into the GDM) the screen goes blank.
2007-03-28T09:32:00.000Z	dan20	Panzor	 It does this is the "Safe Graphics" install mode too
2007-03-28T09:32:00.000Z	Panzor	dan20	I suggest either running the disk check option in that same menu, or burning a new cd
2007-03-28T09:33:00.000Z	dan20	Panzor	 Assuming the disk check is okay, what are some other possibilities I can troubleshoot, or something I can check that would give you a better idea?  I realize "the screen goes blank" is pretty general lol
2007-03-28T09:34:00.000Z	Panzor	dan20	you said that your machine ran ubuntu before (juggling convos)
2007-03-28T09:34:00.000Z	dan20	Panzor	 Well, I'm on Windows at the moment, but I've had Ubuntu 6.06 previously installed on this machine with no large issues.
2007-03-28T09:35:00.000Z	Panzor	dan20	alright, you have all necessary hardware then
2007-03-28T09:35:00.000Z	Panzor	dan20	honestly, the only thing I can think of is to burn a new cd
2007-03-28T09:35:00.000Z	dan20	Panzor	 Yeah, it seems really odd. I've had Gentoo installed before as well with KDE and Gnome.
2007-03-28T09:36:00.000Z	dan20	Panzor	 I'll try that first then
2007-03-28T09:36:00.000Z	Panzor	dan20	yeah, it doesn't take that long if you already have the .iso
2007-03-28T09:36:00.000Z	dan20	Panzor	 Thanks for the help so far
2007-03-28T09:36:00.000Z	Panzor	dan20	no problem
2007-03-28T09:49:00.000Z	dan20	Panzor	 I did a disk check; two things.  I was using a 6.06 CD and it had a checksum mismatch.
2007-03-28T09:50:00.000Z	Panzor	dan20	ah, so it was a faulty disk?
2007-03-28T09:50:00.000Z	dan20	Panzor	 I'm guessing so.  I'm going to download Fiesty Fawn and try it
2007-03-28T09:52:00.000Z	Panzor	dan20	alright cool, I like Edgy only because it's a finish version
2007-03-28T09:52:00.000Z	Panzor	dan20	I'll upgrade when they're done with it
2007-03-28T09:53:00.000Z	dan20	Panzor	Yeah, I'll probably just use Edgy
