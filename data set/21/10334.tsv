2005-04-01T13:30:00.000Z	New2ubuntu		this is getting absurd
2005-04-01T13:30:00.000Z	New2ubuntu		it worked
2005-04-01T13:30:00.000Z	New2ubuntu		but now
2005-04-01T13:30:00.000Z	New2ubuntu		when I type tuxracer I get bash: taxracer: command not found
2005-04-01T13:31:00.000Z	New2ubuntu		which is stupid because apt-get says it already the latest version
2005-04-01T13:31:00.000Z	New2ubuntu		tuxracer doesn't work either
2005-04-01T13:31:00.000Z	New2ubuntu		sorry
2005-04-01T13:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	New2ubuntu	what does the command  ` which tuxracer ` return?
2005-04-01T13:33:00.000Z	thoreauputic	New2ubuntu	you mean you tried to start it in a tty ?
2005-04-01T13:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic	New2ubuntu	your description of what actually happened is unclear...
2005-04-01T13:35:00.000Z	New2ubuntu	thoreauputic	 Simple, I typed Tuxracer into root konsole
2005-04-01T13:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	New2ubuntu	you should never use the "root console" to run graphical applications
2005-04-01T13:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	New2ubuntu	but I think you might have misunderstood...
2005-04-01T13:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	New2ubuntu	using a non-root terminal is fine
2005-04-01T13:38:00.000Z	thoreauputic	New2ubuntu	I don't think you are quite clear on what "root console" means ..?
2005-04-01T13:38:00.000Z	thoreauputic	New2ubuntu	right
2005-04-01T13:39:00.000Z	thoreauputic	New2ubuntu	and that privileged terminal should only be used for administration - not games or ordinary apps
2005-04-01T13:39:00.000Z	thoreauputic	New2ubuntu	else you risk breaking things at best
2005-04-01T13:41:00.000Z	thoreauputic	New2ubuntu	:)
2005-04-01T13:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	New2ubuntu	that's OK - we're here to warn you and help :)
2005-04-01T13:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	New2ubuntu	windows basically runs as root all the time - which is one reason it's so braindead
