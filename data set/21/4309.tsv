2008-09-29T03:54:00.000Z	^paradox^		im just reposting my problem with printer sharing
2008-09-29T03:54:00.000Z	^paradox^		im trying to share the printer an hp psc 1110 over a network with two computers. the computer the printers hooked up to is a windows vista home pc. im trying to share it to this pc running ubuntu 8.04.
2008-09-29T03:54:00.000Z	^paradox^		ive installed samba, samba-common, smbfs. ive configured it and set the vista pc to share files and printers. the printer receives test pages sent to it but doesnt print them. they show up in the job list saying spooling and the printer physically tries to print them, but to no effect.
2008-09-29T03:55:00.000Z	^paradox^		ive ran printing troubleshooter and opened the cups error log both of which ive put in this pastebin http://rafb.net/p/r113tc58.html
2008-09-29T03:55:00.000Z	^paradox^		i posted it on the forums too. just waiting now
2008-09-29T03:57:00.000Z	^paradox^		if anyone can help id really appreciate it. i dont know what else to with the printer
2008-09-29T03:58:00.000Z	Agent_bob	^paradox^	have you used the web interface to cups to see if it would help with that ?    http://localhost:631
2008-09-29T04:01:00.000Z	^paradox^	Agent_bob	i just sent a test page from that and waiting for it to print
2008-09-29T04:03:00.000Z	^paradox^	Agent_bob	there were like ten jobs backed up where i tried to send other test pages
2008-09-29T04:06:00.000Z	Agent_bob	^paradox^	ok check that the printer is not "paused" in cups
2008-09-29T04:06:00.000Z	Agent_bob	^paradox^	i used to see that if the printer accidently got paused.
2008-09-29T04:08:00.000Z	Agent_bob	^paradox^	uh
2008-09-29T04:08:00.000Z	Agent_bob	^paradox^	"pause" it and then "resume" it ?
2008-09-29T04:11:00.000Z	^paradox^	Agent_bob	did u read my pastebin http://rafb.net/p/r113tc58.html ?
2008-09-29T04:11:00.000Z	Agent_bob	^paradox^	yes but didn't see anything that explained the issue
2008-09-29T04:14:00.000Z	Agent_bob	^paradox^	i know this will sound stupid.  but did you try turning off the printer itself and then back on and testing ?
2008-09-29T04:21:00.000Z	Agent_bob	^paradox^	all working now ?
2008-09-29T04:22:00.000Z	Agent_bob	^paradox^	ok i relent.  that issue is over my head.   maybe someone else can help
2008-09-29T04:22:00.000Z	Agent_bob	^paradox^	i've only had printer issues one time myself....    sorry man.  maybe someone else knows more about it.
2008-09-29T04:24:00.000Z	Agent_bob	^paradox^	in the system admin printer   you can delete jobs
2008-09-29T04:25:00.000Z	Agent_bob	^paradox^	think so.
