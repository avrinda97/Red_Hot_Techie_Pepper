2005-07-05T13:53:00.000Z	jtan325		um
2005-07-05T13:53:00.000Z	jtan325		just the commands you want
2005-07-05T13:53:00.000Z	jtan325		no
2005-07-05T13:53:00.000Z	jtan325		export EDITOR=editorname
2005-07-05T13:54:00.000Z	jtan325		sure
2005-07-05T13:54:00.000Z	jtan325		.bashrc is done when you login through the pretty login screen
2005-07-05T13:55:00.000Z	jtan325		it sets the default editor right
2005-07-05T13:55:00.000Z	jtan325		i think its vim by default
2005-07-05T13:55:00.000Z	jtan325		i like emacs
2005-07-05T13:55:00.000Z	jtan325		so that's what i do
2005-07-05T13:55:00.000Z	ratl3	jtan325	emacs sucks
2005-07-05T13:55:00.000Z	jtan325		well
2005-07-05T13:55:00.000Z	jtan325		if you did something like "cvs commit XXX.txt"
2005-07-05T13:56:00.000Z	jtan325		it would have to popup some editor so you would add the message comment
2005-07-05T13:56:00.000Z	jtan325	ratl3	what's wrong with emacs
2005-07-05T13:56:00.000Z	jtan325		i am going to try learning vim soon
2005-07-05T13:56:00.000Z	jtan325		but that's what i got started with in school
2005-07-05T13:57:00.000Z	jtan325		anyway i am going to go home, finally got this problem fixed at work
2005-07-05T13:57:00.000Z	ratl3	jtan325	nothing, i just learned vim first
2005-07-05T13:57:00.000Z	jtan325		later all
2005-07-05T13:57:00.000Z	ratl3	jtan325	so, it sucks
