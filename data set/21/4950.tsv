2011-04-28T19:24:00.000Z	brianl		I had a lot of problems and when I was updating to 11.04 something messed up and everything broke and I couldnt get anything to work. So i deleted it and reinstalled 10.04...now I can't get my computer to recognize my wireless internet card. Its a BCM4311 and I know how to set it up, but it won't even see it under lspci?
2011-04-28T19:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brianl	do a clean install of natty instead :)
2011-04-28T19:25:00.000Z	brianl	ActionParsnip	Is there a reason my computer won't recognize my wireless card anymore?
2011-04-28T19:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brianl	does it show in:  sudo lshw -C network
2011-04-28T19:26:00.000Z	brianl	ActionParsnip	Nope, just my direct connection
2011-04-28T19:27:00.000Z	brianl	ActionParsnip	I had to partition everything myself when reinstalling because 11.04 was on there and i had to delete that and format the partition, I set the mount point at / for 10.04, would that mess anything up?
2011-04-28T19:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brianl	can't see that being an issue
2011-04-28T19:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brianl	is there a switch to turn the wifi off and on
2011-04-28T19:28:00.000Z	brianl	ActionParsnip	there is a button on the laptop, but ive hit it several times and nothing ;/
2011-04-28T19:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brianl	reboot and run:  dmesg | less     and read through, is the wireless device detected?
2011-04-28T19:32:00.000Z	brianl	ActionParsnip	nope, no wireless card was detected
2011-04-28T19:32:00.000Z	brianl	ActionParsnip	Maybe i will download natty onto a cd and perform a clean install and try again ugh
2011-04-28T19:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brianl	and that's in a Lucid install
2011-04-28T19:32:00.000Z	brianl	ActionParsnip	yes lucid, it has always worked before also
2011-04-28T19:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brianl	very strange
2011-04-28T19:33:00.000Z	brianl	ActionParsnip	yep, maybe this button needs to be pressed on startup or something, ill mess around with it ;) Thanks anyways
2011-04-28T19:40:00.000Z	brianl	ActionParsnip	I got it working now ;D I booted into windows, turned the wireless on, then booted back into linux and it worked.
2011-04-28T19:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brianl	cool, I suggest you go into device manager and tell windows to not allow the device to wake up the OS, and disable power management on it
2011-05-12T05:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brianl	which release?
2011-05-12T05:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brianl	http://www.multimediaboom.com/how-to-install-java-in-ubuntu-11-04-natty-narwhal-ppa/
2011-05-12T05:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	brianl	that ppa has a later version :)
