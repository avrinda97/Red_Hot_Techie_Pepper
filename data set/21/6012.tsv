2007-06-18T14:06:00.000Z	Chore-Boy		well, wine worked, kindof....
2007-06-18T14:07:00.000Z	Chore-Boy		the only thing, other than diablo, that i tried to open, was alcohol.... but then alcohol wouldnt close lol
2007-06-18T14:07:00.000Z	Chore-Boy		makes me wish i still had a windows98 cd, lol....
2007-06-18T14:07:00.000Z	Chore-Boy		i heard u had to pay for cedega
2007-06-18T14:07:00.000Z	Chore-Boy		so i didnt even mess with it
2007-06-18T14:08:00.000Z	Chore-Boy		wine didnt seem to work with diablo, although "they" said it worked just fine on the website
2007-06-18T14:09:00.000Z	pha|con	Chore-Boy	you can't run it from your windows partition, you have to install it from scratch for it to work properly
2007-06-18T14:12:00.000Z	pha|con	Chore-Boy	no, you have to install diablo from scratch, you can't just play it from your windows partition
2007-06-18T14:13:00.000Z	Chore-Boy	pha|con	so i install diablo, through wine?
2007-06-18T14:13:00.000Z	pha|con	Chore-Boy	yeah, just run the setup off the disk through wine.
2007-06-18T14:14:00.000Z	pha|con	Chore-Boy	yeah
2007-06-18T14:14:00.000Z	pha|con	Chore-Boy	actually, sudo apt-get install wine
2007-06-18T14:14:00.000Z	Chore-Boy	pha|con	u know if it will work through battle.net?
2007-06-18T14:14:00.000Z	pha|con	Chore-Boy	as long as your CD-key is valid ;)
2007-06-18T14:15:00.000Z	Chore-Boy	pha|con	of course....
2007-06-18T14:15:00.000Z	pha|con	Chore-Boy	should work just fine, then
2007-06-18T14:17:00.000Z	Chore-Boy	pha|con	before i spend half an hour shuffling diablo disks... can i just copy the windows' dir of diablo to a folder on linux? and run it from there
2007-06-18T14:17:00.000Z	pha|con	Chore-Boy	fraid not, man.
