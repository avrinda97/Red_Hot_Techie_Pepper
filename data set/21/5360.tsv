2007-10-30T01:32:00.000Z	dvayanu		does someone know how to make the ipod touch work under ubuntu 7.10?
2007-10-30T01:32:00.000Z	doubled	dvayanu	i have the same problem :p
2007-10-30T01:33:00.000Z	dvayanu	doubled	at least it charges now
2007-10-30T01:33:00.000Z	doubled	dvayanu	yeh, that works fine over here too. i think it is possible to load songs on it. but not videos
2007-10-30T01:34:00.000Z	dvayanu	doubled	btw, i jailbreaked mine today
2007-10-30T01:35:00.000Z	dvayanu	doubled	also got mail and stuff to work?
2007-10-30T01:35:00.000Z	dvayanu	doubled	calendar doesnt let me add items though
2007-10-30T01:35:00.000Z	doubled	dvayanu	go to the isntaller, and go to the end of the list. there should be a calendar option to be installed
2007-10-30T01:36:00.000Z	doubled	dvayanu	after that you are able to click on the plus and add items to the calendar
2007-10-30T01:37:00.000Z	dvayanu	doubled	ok, i'll try, so far i copied a Nsomething lst file
2007-10-30T01:41:00.000Z	dvayanu	doubled	do you also have a decent free space problem in the root partition?
2007-10-30T01:42:00.000Z	doubled	dvayanu	in linux? or you mean on ipod ?
2007-10-30T01:42:00.000Z	dvayanu	doubled	on the ipod
2007-10-30T01:42:00.000Z	dvayanu	doubled	i have 11Mb left
2007-10-30T01:43:00.000Z	doubled	dvayanu	well the space reserved for installing applications is not big. the applications themselves are not so big eitehr so thats ok
2007-10-30T01:44:00.000Z	dvayanu	doubled	yes, but i get the warnings... and i fear next 11MB mail will kill it :-)
2007-10-30T01:44:00.000Z	dvayanu	doubled	and uninstalling doesnt help unfortunately
2007-10-30T01:45:00.000Z	doubled	dvayanu	im not sure if attachments are saved on the device
2007-10-30T01:49:00.000Z	dvayanu	doubled	if you find how to mount the touch under gutsy, would you drop me a note?
2007-10-30T01:50:00.000Z	doubled	dvayanu	sure. im gonna sleep now though but will be back later
2007-10-30T01:51:00.000Z	dvayanu	doubled	just pmsg me if you know something, i'll do the same
