2007-11-27T03:52:00.000Z	Pelo	Rukus	what do you expect it to do ?
2007-11-27T03:53:00.000Z	Pelo	Rukus	 the only use for a winkey that I know of is to open the start menu in windows,  it doesn't have an assigned use in ubuntu by default

2007-11-27T04:05:00.000Z	Pelo	Rukus	in windows the windows key opens the start menu, I have used windows before, but you donT, seem to understand taht there is no preassigned function to the windows key in linux
2007-11-27T04:07:00.000Z	Pelo	Rukus	 when you say y our windows key is not working,  do you mean it is not working in windows ?
