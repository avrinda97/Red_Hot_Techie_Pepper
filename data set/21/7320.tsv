2006-10-23T05:41:00.000Z	Flannel	bododo	The DVDs have more packages, you might look into debian, they have all their packages available on CDs, ubuntu plans to, but it hasn't happened yet
2006-10-23T05:45:00.000Z	Flannel	bododo	grab the server CD
2006-10-23T05:45:00.000Z	bododo	Flannel	so, when I grab the server one can I install both?
2006-10-23T05:46:00.000Z	Flannel	bododo	grab the alternate ISO, it comes with apache
2006-10-23T05:47:00.000Z	bododo	Flannel	but then how 'bout the desktop side? i also need it
2006-10-23T05:47:00.000Z	Flannel	bododo	alternate ISOs are the dekstops, with some additional packages (like apache, for instance)
2006-10-23T05:47:00.000Z	bododo	Flannel	you suggest me to install the desktop version and then individually install the servers packages?
2006-10-23T05:48:00.000Z	Flannel	bododo	no.  download the 'alternate' iso, it has the desktop stuff, and apache etc on it.  then you install apache from the CD
2006-10-23T05:49:00.000Z	Flannel	bododo	yes.  right.
2006-10-23T05:49:00.000Z	bododo	Flannel	but... my Internet speed :( poor me, it's but 128kb/s
2007-04-30T05:19:00.000Z	Flannel	bododo	try #ubuntu-ppc, that seems to exist
