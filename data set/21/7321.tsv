2006-10-22T16:54:00.000Z	trz		Right now fsck says that root inode is not a directory and suggests to clear it. After that it seems to try to do something on all inodes starting from some number - clear i_size, i_blocks and compression flag. Is that what I should do?
2006-10-22T05:46:00.000Z	trz		Okay.
2006-10-22T05:47:00.000Z	trz		After running fsck, all my partition is blank, except for lost+found which contains only junk.
2006-10-22T05:47:00.000Z	trz		Is there any way I could recover it?
2006-10-22T05:48:00.000Z	trz		Lost everything?
2006-10-22T05:49:00.000Z	cosmodad	trz	did you apply the correct filesystem paramete?
2006-10-22T05:50:00.000Z	cosmodad	trz	eek
2006-10-22T05:50:00.000Z	cosmodad	trz	why did you execute fsck in the first place?
2006-10-22T05:51:00.000Z	cosmodad	trz	what what the cause of filesystem gabbish?
2006-10-22T05:52:00.000Z	trz	cosmodad	That's kind of awkward now, but I wouldn't expect it to hurt so much. Just wanted to see if everything's alright because Azureus made my system hang.
2006-10-22T05:53:00.000Z	cosmodad	trz	usually when you have to hit yes a bunch of times it's because of inodes fixes and stuff like that but that's hard to tell without the exact error messages
2006-10-22T05:54:00.000Z	trz	cosmodad	Yes, it was like it. Actually, for the first (and doomed) time I didn't really remember the messages. Then I cleared the journal, which sounded suspicious, then root inode, and then there was a big big list of inode changes.
2006-10-22T05:54:00.000Z	cosmodad	trz	you cleared the journal yourself or because fsck asked you to do so?
2006-10-22T05:55:00.000Z	trz	cosmodad	fsck.
2006-10-22T05:55:00.000Z	cosmodad	trz	geez. :/ sadly, I'm not much of a fsck pro. If there's a bunch of stuff in lost+found, however, I guess there's some way to recover
2006-10-22T05:56:00.000Z	trz	cosmodad	I've had 12G of data on that partition, and that's exactly the size of lost+found
2006-10-22T05:57:00.000Z	cosmodad	trz	so you might try copying some files from l+f and check if it works
2006-10-22T05:57:00.000Z	cosmodad	trz	I'd make a backup of everything and then try
2006-10-22T05:59:00.000Z	cosmodad	trz	AFAIK there's no way to get back the original name, but you really wanna look that up again
2006-10-22T06:00:00.000Z	cosmodad	trz	maybe try #debian (but don't say you're from ubuntu ;) ) or #linux or google
2006-10-22T06:00:00.000Z	cosmodad	trz	but backup first
