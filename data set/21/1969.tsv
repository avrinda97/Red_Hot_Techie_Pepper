2010-02-28T02:15:00.000Z	wiesshund		Ive a question i probably know the answer to but...  I installed ubuntu 64bit not thinking that optimaly i should have had 4gb of ram. It isnt possible to simply recompile the kernel for 32bit is it?
2010-02-28T02:16:00.000Z	heroin_	wiesshund	just keep 64bit
2010-02-28T02:16:00.000Z	heroin_	wiesshund	only use 32bit if your processor cant handle 32bit instructions
2010-02-28T02:16:00.000Z	wiesshund	heroin_	 any suggestions on seeding it up a bit? ive got 2gb ram

2010-02-28T02:17:00.000Z	heroin_	wiesshund	how is it lagging?
2010-02-28T02:17:00.000Z	heroin_	wiesshund	if you drag screens around it doesnt look smooth?
2010-02-28T02:17:00.000Z	wiesshund		heroin i guess mostly when launching apps
2010-02-28T02:18:00.000Z	heroin_	wiesshund	system > prefrence > appearance > no graphical effects
2010-02-28T02:18:00.000Z	wiesshund	heroin_	 oh i can drag screens around fast enough to give a siezure, just seems a little long in tooth when launching things
2010-02-28T02:19:00.000Z	heroin_	wiesshund	system > administration > system monitor
2010-02-28T02:19:00.000Z	heroin_		have a look at what part of your system spikes when you launch something
2010-02-28T02:19:00.000Z	heroin_	wiesshund	i have 2GB of ram and that is more then plenty
2010-02-28T02:21:00.000Z	wiesshund	heroin_	 ok tried that, guess its just cpu spiking. launched firefox and it hit 100% for a second
2010-02-28T02:22:00.000Z	wiesshund	heroin_	guess i shouldnt complain, its an old newcastle athlon64 2.2ghz
2010-02-28T02:22:00.000Z	heroin_	wiesshund	 urm.. wiesshund that should be plenty fast
2010-02-28T02:23:00.000Z	heroin_	wiesshund	perhaps you want to switch over to a faster windows manager then gnome, have a look at xubuntu or xfce if you really have speed issues
2010-02-28T02:40:00.000Z	wiesshund		What exactly does PM mean by this msg?  balazar3-3d:
