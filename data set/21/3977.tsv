2008-09-25T17:20:00.000Z	webfarmer		I did a recent upgrade and now I can't even get to my login window
2008-09-25T17:20:00.000Z	webfarmer		it flickers in this endless loop
2008-09-25T17:21:00.000Z	webfarmer		with the default drum audio playing over and over again
2008-09-25T17:21:00.000Z	webfarmer		can someone please help me
2008-09-25T17:22:00.000Z	LjL	webfarmer	ActionParsnip: well, if he hears the startup sound, i think that means it reaches GNOME, so the X settings might not be the problem perhaps
2008-09-25T17:49:00.000Z	LjL	webfarmer	in order to use backup?
2008-09-25T17:50:00.000Z	LjL	webfarmer	what the heck did you type? i believe the last thing that jrib told you to type was "cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf{,.backup}", and it doesn't sound like you typed *that*
2008-09-25T17:54:00.000Z	LjL	webfarmer	i don't know. but i asked

2008-09-25T17:57:00.000Z	LjL	webfarmer	well, now, i believe you were told to modify xorg.conf so that it would use the "nv" driver... although i don't personally believe that's the problem, honestly
2008-09-25T17:58:00.000Z	LjL	webfarmer	try typing "apt-get dist-upgrade" and tell me what it says (use the pastebin if it doesn't fit in one line)
2008-09-25T18:03:00.000Z	webfarmer	LjL	okay did the dist-upgrade and it says 0 upgraded 0 newly 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded
2008-09-25T18:05:00.000Z	LjL	webfarmer	ok, then the problem wasn't what i thought. you could 1) try typing "adduser testuser", then follow the instructions, then reboot, then login as "testuser" and see if that works. if it does, then at least we know the problem is confined to your user.  2) if the problem is in xorg.conf, you can edit it by typing "nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf", then search for Driver "nvidia", and change it into Driver "nv" (at least, that's what i think they suggested to
2008-09-25T18:07:00.000Z	webfarmer	LjL	What am I looking for in this file because I can't find nvidia
2008-09-25T18:08:00.000Z	LjL	webfarmer	if you can't find nvidia, then you aren't looking for anything really, and you probably should ignore that suggestion. but make sure it really isn't there: you can search by hitting Ctrl+W, then type "nvidia" and Enter
2008-09-25T18:10:00.000Z	webfarmer	LjL	I typed add user but I'm trying to backspace and it's giving me all these weird characters
2008-09-25T18:10:00.000Z	LjL	webfarmer	hit ctrl+c and start from scratch
2008-09-25T18:12:00.000Z	LjL	webfarmer	when you boot, do you see a login screen at all? or doesn't it even let you enter your username?
2008-09-25T18:13:00.000Z	webfarmer	LjL	doesn't even get to the login
2008-09-25T20:47:00.000Z	LjL	webfarmer	the bootloader that loads your operating system when your computer powers on
2008-10-01T22:21:00.000Z	LjL	webfarmer	don't do that
