2007-05-25T10:54:00.000Z	alex_gy		I hate to be a bother but if someone could perhaps whisper me with their solution I'd appreciate it as I find it hard to follow the thread in a busy chatroom
2007-05-25T10:56:00.000Z	alex_gy		as previously stated yellowtime , I have an nforce 550 chipset and am using feisty.  I can only get sound to play out of the headphone jack on my pc, and it won't come out of any other port, like my main port.
2007-05-25T10:56:00.000Z	alex_gy		when checking my alsa panel, under switches it only shows iec958 and headphone
2007-05-25T10:57:00.000Z	alex_gy		any ideas on how to get my main speaker port to show?
2007-05-25T10:58:00.000Z	alex_gy		all channels that I can see have been unmuted
2007-05-25T10:58:00.000Z	alex_gy		you talking to me, yello?

2007-05-25T11:07:00.000Z	EADG	alex_gy	Sound problems are very common, many fixes have been posted for specific probs/hardware.
2007-05-25T11:07:00.000Z	alex_gy		I suppose that's the best I'm going to get *sigh*.  Thank you anyhow
