2005-09-07T12:55:00.000Z	Blissex	ColonelKernel	at spring. :-)
2005-09-07T12:56:00.000Z	Blissex	ColonelKernel	in theory when you open your laptop and press the power button.
2005-09-07T12:57:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	Blissex	how about on a desktop?
2005-09-07T12:57:00.000Z	Blissex	ColonelKernel	should be the ''soft power'' button, but not sure.
2005-09-07T12:58:00.000Z	Blissex	ColonelKernel	try pressing the power button as if powering it up.
2005-09-07T12:58:00.000Z	Blissex	ColonelKernel	hibernate does not necessarily work that well, especially on a desktop.
2005-09-07T12:58:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	Blissex	works great if I could get it to return :((
2005-09-07T12:59:00.000Z	Blissex	ColonelKernel	in suspending, saving is easy, it is restoring that is hard.
2005-10-08T16:53:00.000Z	Blissex	ColonelKernel	consider reading http://tinyurl.com/bz8v4 on how to ask more detailed questions...
2005-10-08T16:54:00.000Z	Blissex	ColonelKernel	sometimes but not always that can be a hardware issue. Signal 11 usually brings bad luck.
2005-10-08T05:11:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	Blissex	file plays fine in windows
