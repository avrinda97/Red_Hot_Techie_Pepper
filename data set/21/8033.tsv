2006-07-03T09:02:00.000Z	mooseman447		how about does anybody know how to "lock" a user to their home directory?
2006-07-03T09:03:00.000Z	mooseman447		wastrel all they have is web hosting so i dont think they need many commands
2006-07-03T09:04:00.000Z	polpak	mooseman447	how do you mean restrict them to thier home directory?
2006-07-03T09:04:00.000Z	polpak	mooseman447	they'd need to be able to read/execute stuff in the bin directories obviously
2006-07-03T09:04:00.000Z	polpak	mooseman447	otherwise the system wouldn't be useable for anything other than file storage
2006-07-03T09:04:00.000Z	mooseman447	polpak	i dont want them to try to cd to places if i make a mistake and they can
2006-07-03T09:04:00.000Z	mooseman447	polpak	all im providing them is web hosting
2006-07-03T09:05:00.000Z	polpak	mooseman447	then don't give them shell access, and use an (s)ftp server which chroots them
2006-07-03T09:06:00.000Z	mooseman447	polpak	yea i have a ftp server but i thought they would like to change their password and wget and simple stuff like that
2006-07-03T09:06:00.000Z	polpak	mooseman447	the less access you give them the better. You can create a web interface for updating their passwords if you like
2006-07-03T09:06:00.000Z	mooseman447	polpak	how would i go about doing that?
2006-07-03T09:07:00.000Z	polpak	mooseman447	but giving them shell access just increases the number of security risks you'll encounter without any real benifit on your part
2006-07-03T09:07:00.000Z	mooseman447	polpak	ok fair enough ill disable it
2006-07-03T09:11:00.000Z	polpak	mooseman447	tail -f /var/log/auth.log
2006-07-03T09:11:00.000Z	mooseman447	polpak	thanks thats what i wanted
2006-07-03T09:31:00.000Z	polpak	mooseman447	you have to instruct your ftp server to do it
2006-07-03T09:32:00.000Z	polpak	mooseman447	generally this is done in a config file
2006-07-03T09:32:00.000Z	mooseman447	polpak	do you know how to with proftpd?
2006-07-03T09:32:00.000Z	polpak	mooseman447	not offhand, but you you check the man page it should say
2006-07-03T09:32:00.000Z	polpak	mooseman447	or they have good documentation on their website
2006-07-03T09:32:00.000Z	mooseman447	polpak	thanks for the help ill look
