2010-07-01T10:13:00.000Z	abhi_nav	mneptok	ok
2010-07-01T10:23:00.000Z	mneptok	abhi_nav	chmod does not change ownership
2010-07-01T10:24:00.000Z	mneptok	abhi_nav	yes it does. but it does not change ownership.
2010-07-01T10:25:00.000Z	mneptok	abhi_nav	and you need to work on your tab-complete ;)
2010-07-01T10:25:00.000Z	abhi_nav	mneptok	:D
2010-07-01T10:27:00.000Z	abhi_nav	mneptok	what is maria project?
2010-07-01T10:28:00.000Z	mneptok	abhi_nav	http://mariadb.org
2010-07-05T10:00:00.000Z	mneptok	abhi_nav	sudo apt-get install thunderbird
2010-07-05T11:36:00.000Z	mneptok	abhi_nav	Adobe has not released any details about firther Flash x86-64 development, so saying "soon" has no basis in fact
2010-07-05T11:37:00.000Z	mneptok	abhi_nav	so it should be no trouble for you to provide a URL
2010-07-05T11:39:00.000Z	mneptok	abhi_nav	i don't doubt that. but tell me where  you get the concept of "soon"
2010-07-05T11:39:00.000Z	mneptok	abhi_nav	they could release the x86-64 version in 15 years and what you quoted will still be true
2010-07-05T11:40:00.000Z	abhi_nav	mneptok	in that case it is 'soon' only because all knw that they will not take 15 years. 1year can be a 'soon' for me and it is ok
2010-07-05T11:41:00.000Z	mneptok	abhi_nav	you do not know that. so please don't say "soon" when the developer has not said "soon"
2010-07-05T11:41:00.000Z	mneptok	abhi_nav	say exactly what you put in quotes above.
2010-07-05T11:44:00.000Z	abhi_nav	mneptok	from my perception of view 1year is come under 'soon' and i tell him in that way. and I wll. I dont see any problem in 1yr
2010-07-05T11:45:00.000Z	mneptok	abhi_nav	one last time. Adobe *never* gave a time frame. ever. your "one year" assertion is all in your head.
2010-07-05T11:45:00.000Z	mneptok	abhi_nav	go look at the Wikipedia entry for Duke Nukem Forever
2010-07-05T11:49:00.000Z	abhi_nav	mneptok	, so you want me to recommend newcomers that' hey atleast 15 years for 64 bit flash. leave your 64bit os right now. go for 32 bit'
2010-07-05T11:50:00.000Z	mneptok	abhi_nav	one last time. say what you said in quotes above. nothing more.
