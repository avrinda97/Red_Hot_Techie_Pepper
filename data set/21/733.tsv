2011-11-03T09:10:00.000Z	flknefw		hey
2011-11-03T09:11:00.000Z	flknefw		can i burn a macintosh disk image via linux?
2011-11-03T09:12:00.000Z	flknefw		its a .dmg file
2011-11-03T09:13:00.000Z	flknefw		basically im trying to put osx back onto my macbook pro so i can make it a dual boot
2011-11-03T09:14:00.000Z	flknefw		so if i use brasero to burn a dmg file it will be bootable via mac?
2011-11-03T09:14:00.000Z	zykotick9	flknefw	i don't think you'll be successful in burning that dmg - good luck though
2011-11-03T09:15:00.000Z	zykotick9	flknefw	it's not a linux native format - my googling just turned up converting to ISOs (i certainly could be wrong)
2011-11-03T09:16:00.000Z	zykotick9	flknefw	ya, i know - thus my origional statement ;)
2011-11-03T09:17:00.000Z	zykotick9	flknefw	try and see
2011-11-03T09:19:00.000Z	zykotick9	flknefw	this poster converted to iso to burn with brasero http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=926410
2011-11-03T09:20:00.000Z	zykotick9	flknefw	me neither
2011-11-03T09:22:00.000Z	zykotick9	flknefw	microsoft is crappy, but apple is ok - i don't see a difference there ;)
2011-11-03T09:24:00.000Z	zykotick9	flknefw	i doubt it - it's not a gnu/linux native format, period.
2011-11-03T09:25:00.000Z	zykotick9	flknefw	probably... i'm afraid.
2011-11-03T09:26:00.000Z	zykotick9	flknefw	have a friend with an apple?
2011-11-03T09:48:00.000Z	zykotick9	flknefw	installing OSX into a VM is a violation of apple policy
2011-11-03T10:20:00.000Z	zykotick9	flknefw	i think you need to include the detail that it's a DMG OSX that needs to be bootable, and not a linux ISO
2011-11-03T10:34:00.000Z	zykotick9	flknefw	2012 april
2011-11-03T10:56:00.000Z	zykotick9	flknefw	it's not going to work - and it's certainly not supported in #vbox (i'd recommend against asking there, they don't approve of violating apples licenses)
2011-11-03T10:57:00.000Z	zykotick9	flknefw	wow, you're right.  looks like the new version of vbox can run OSX.  sorry for the bad info.
2011-11-03T11:15:00.000Z	zykotick9	flknefw	ActionParsnip according to https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/6760 vbox 4 has dmg support
