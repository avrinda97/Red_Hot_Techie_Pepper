2006-06-14T15:23:00.000Z	ompaul	loanwolf	what version of ubuntu are you using?
2006-06-14T15:23:00.000Z	ompaul	loanwolf	did you upgrade from something to get there?
2006-06-14T15:25:00.000Z	ompaul	loanwolf	do this, lab_release -d and give the reply please
2006-06-14T15:25:00.000Z	loanwolf	ompaul	in terminal
2006-06-14T15:25:00.000Z	ompaul	loanwolf	yes
2006-06-14T15:27:00.000Z	loanwolf	ompaul	says command not found
2006-06-14T15:27:00.000Z	ompaul	loanwolf	correction >>  lsb_release -d  << sorry
2006-06-14T15:28:00.000Z	loanwolf	ompaul	6.06
2006-06-14T15:31:00.000Z	ompaul	loanwolf	do uname -a and I think you will find that you have a 2.6 kernel running
2006-06-14T15:32:00.000Z	loanwolf	ompaul	uname -r   ....2.6.15-23-386
2006-06-14T15:32:00.000Z	ompaul	loanwolf	so your running the latest
2006-06-14T15:33:00.000Z	loanwolf	ompaul	why is this slow
2006-06-14T15:33:00.000Z	ompaul	loanwolf	power of processor, network connection something else, your not saying what is slow
2006-06-14T15:35:00.000Z	loanwolf	ompaul	 ubuntu it self......i was running kde 3.5.3 in mandriva 2006 4 times faster then im runing gnome in ubuntu...
2006-06-14T15:36:00.000Z	ompaul	loanwolf	ask in #kubuntu I guess they know the most about kubuntu - could be eye candy issues or maybe something else
2006-06-14T15:37:00.000Z	loanwolf	ompaul	 im not runing kubuntu..im runing ubuntu with gnome...kde was in mandriva'
2006-06-14T15:38:00.000Z	ompaul	loanwolf	ahh, so I don't know, it should be faster, so what kind of proc have you got, what kind of video card, what kind of disks and how much room, and how much ram
2006-06-14T15:40:00.000Z	loanwolf	ompaul	p2 450...384 mb ram.... 128 mb nvidia geforce4.....120 gig hdd.....unbuntu....   /11 gig    /swap  1 gig /home 36 gig
2006-06-14T15:41:00.000Z	ompaul	loanwolf	you should use "xubuntu" for that - >> sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop << it will be a lot faster
2006-06-14T15:42:00.000Z	loanwolf	ompaul	ok
