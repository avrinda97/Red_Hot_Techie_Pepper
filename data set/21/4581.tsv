2008-03-30T14:25:00.000Z	ompaul	kelvin911	try it on a live cd and then come back with specific issues in most cases you will be okay - or better still do a dual boot- or better still kill off windows and make the jump

2008-03-30T14:39:00.000Z	ompaul	kelvin911	you don't you install it within wine
2008-03-30T14:41:00.000Z	ompaul	kelvin911	what if you go with the flow it is not a replacement it is an alternative and you have to do what I suggest you can copy your saved stuff after the install I guess
