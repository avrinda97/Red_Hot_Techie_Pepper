2011-10-17T15:50:00.000Z	yezariaely		so what is the reason that there is no gnome classic in 11.11, but only this unity thing?!
2011-10-17T15:50:00.000Z	Semtex	yezariaely	yes
2011-10-17T15:50:00.000Z	Semtex	yezariaely	but you can do 'sudo apt-get install gnome-session-fallback'
2011-10-17T15:51:00.000Z	yezariaely	Semtex	 any problems with this aproach?
2011-10-17T15:51:00.000Z	Semtex	yezariaely	a few minor problems but its useable
2011-10-17T15:51:00.000Z	Semtex	yezariaely	I am having it randomly start up with unity
2011-10-17T15:51:00.000Z	yezariaely	Semtex	If this works, you made my day :)
2011-10-17T15:51:00.000Z	Semtex	yezariaely	it does
2011-10-17T15:53:00.000Z	Semtex	yezariaely	to get 'ubunu classic' in 11.10, open a terminal and run 'sudo apt-get install gnome-session-fallback', one you have done that log out, click on the cog icon and choose 'ubuntu classic' then log back in
2011-10-17T15:53:00.000Z	yezariaely	Semtex	sure already doing it
2011-10-17T15:55:00.000Z	Semtex	yezariaely	few things you should know right click no longer works on the panels (to move, add, remove items), you have to press alt & right click instead
2011-10-17T15:56:00.000Z	yezariaely	Semtex	you MADE my day. It is still very ugly, but better than this unity thing...
2011-10-17T15:56:00.000Z	Semtex	yezariaely	also the screensaver is a bit werid it keeps asking me for a password even tho I dont use one at boot, and it occasionally boots into unity (but logging out and choosing 'ubuntu classic' fixes that)
2011-10-17T15:57:00.000Z	Semtex	yezariaely	but yeah it works
2011-10-17T15:57:00.000Z	yezariaely	Semtex	I use ubuntu in office and at home. But this decision makes me think to choose some other distro.
2011-10-17T15:57:00.000Z	Semtex	yezariaely	your not the only one
2011-10-17T15:58:00.000Z	Semtex	yezariaely	but I am lazy for the moment it will do
2011-10-17T15:58:00.000Z	yezariaely	Semtex	we could file a "bug"
2011-10-17T16:00:00.000Z	Semtex	yezariaely	its a controversial decision made by the ubuntu management
2011-10-17T16:00:00.000Z	Semtex	yezariaely	but I dont think its going to change
2011-10-17T16:01:00.000Z	yezariaely	Semtex	so let's take over the management :D
