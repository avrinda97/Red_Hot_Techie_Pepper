2008-06-27T00:38:00.000Z	n0kS		Gigs how you installed audacious? from apt-get or compiling it yourself?
2008-06-27T00:39:00.000Z	Gigs	n0kS	apt-get
2008-06-27T00:39:00.000Z	Gigs	n0kS	standard repos
2008-06-27T00:39:00.000Z	Gigs	n0kS	8.04 LTS
2008-06-27T00:39:00.000Z	Gigs	n0kS	did you run it before?
2008-06-27T00:40:00.000Z	Gigs	n0kS	I suspect if you already had an audacious playlist you wouldn't get this error :P
2008-06-27T00:41:00.000Z	Gigs	n0kS	one way to test would be for you to move ~/.config/audacious to a new name and then try to start audacious on your system
2008-06-27T00:41:00.000Z	Gigs	n0kS	if it fails to regenerate a default config we know it's a global bug
2008-06-27T00:43:00.000Z	Gigs	n0kS	ok thanks
2008-06-27T00:44:00.000Z	Gigs	n0kS	heh hmm, well it no longer gives the error at least!
2008-06-27T00:44:00.000Z	Gigs	n0kS	but when I run audacious it returns to the command line with no error
2008-06-27T00:44:00.000Z	Gigs	n0kS	$? is 0 also so no error code
2008-06-27T00:44:00.000Z	Gigs	n0kS	so now it just does nothing hehe
2008-06-27T00:45:00.000Z	Gigs	n0kS	wait there was a hung one in the background
2008-06-27T00:46:00.000Z	Gigs	n0kS	now that I killed it it works
2008-06-27T00:46:00.000Z	Gigs	n0kS	well I haven't tested it.  But I think I know what was happening
2008-06-27T00:47:00.000Z	Gigs	n0kS	I assumed the failed to load error was fatal, and that is why it was exiting
2008-06-27T00:47:00.000Z	Gigs	n0kS	but instead it was exiting because a copy was already running
2008-06-27T00:47:00.000Z	Gigs	n0kS	there is no message if it exits due to an already running copy
2008-06-27T00:49:00.000Z	Gigs	n0kS	I think it is working now
2008-06-27T00:49:00.000Z	Gigs	n0kS	the hung background process was making it exit, and the non-fatal message about a missing playlist mislead me
