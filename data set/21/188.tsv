2012-06-17T14:47:00.000Z	CoolaNisse		I managed to use ln -s to bind my modem1 to ttyacm0 .. now i dont want this anymore but i dont know how to revert or find modem1
2012-06-17T14:48:00.000Z	SunTsu	CoolaNisse	rm modem1
2012-06-17T14:49:00.000Z	SunTsu	CoolaNisse	If you don't know how to find it: use locate modem1 oder find / -name modem1 - but frankly, symlinking device file times are over some years
2012-06-17T14:49:00.000Z	CoolaNisse		okay and then rebind?
2012-06-17T14:50:00.000Z	CoolaNisse	SunTsu	yes but i didnt find a solution :(
2012-06-17T14:50:00.000Z	CoolaNisse		sunTsu; will modem1 recreate?
2012-06-17T14:50:00.000Z	SunTsu	CoolaNisse	for what exactly?
2012-06-17T14:50:00.000Z	CoolaNisse		running playsms/sms3 for a smsgateway
2012-06-17T14:50:00.000Z	SunTsu	CoolaNisse	you might want to try writing longer sentences which make clear what you are talking about
2012-06-17T14:50:00.000Z	CoolaNisse		symlinking modem to ttyusb0 worked
2012-06-17T14:51:00.000Z	CoolaNisse		If I use rm modem1, will symlinks dissapear?
2012-06-17T14:52:00.000Z	SunTsu	CoolaNisse	could you please try not to be as terse as possible and write what exactly you are trying to do? In one line, with more than 3 wrords?
2012-06-17T14:53:00.000Z	SunTsu		words even
2012-06-17T14:53:00.000Z	CoolaNisse	SunTsu	This is the error given by smsd.log .. i have no ttyacmo connected only ttyusb.. but i had before ttyacmo (but nothing remain in config) .. look here the error  modem1: Cannot open serial port /dev/ttyACM0, error: No such file or directory
2012-06-17T14:54:00.000Z	SunTsu	CoolaNisse	So there is no ttyACM0, then you might want to configure smsd to use /dev/usb0
2012-06-17T14:55:00.000Z	SunTsu		/dev/ttyusb0 even
2012-06-17T14:55:00.000Z	CoolaNisse	SunTsu	That I have.. but as I told you earlier  I created a stone-age symlink which I don't know how to remove. Smsd is configured to use modem1 which points to ttyacm0
2012-06-17T14:56:00.000Z	CoolaNisse		create a script to do it on bootup? :o
2012-06-17T14:57:00.000Z	SunTsu	CoolaNisse	No. You didn't. But anyway, I already told you that you can remove that link using rm modem1 - or /dev/modem1 - and then link /dev/ttyusb0 to it, just the ways you did before
2012-06-17T14:58:00.000Z	CoolaNisse	SunTsu	PEace be with you. The Java client is not my favorite one! =)
2012-06-17T14:59:00.000Z	SunTsu	CoolaNisse	I wish I would understand more than a third of your sentences, they badly lack context
