2006-12-03T11:08:00.000Z	wceoscar		is xchat the best irc client for ubuntu?
2006-12-03T11:08:00.000Z	sain	wceoscar	in other words, yes
2006-12-03T11:08:00.000Z	sain	wceoscar	if you want a graphical IRC client
2006-12-03T11:08:00.000Z	sain	wceoscar	don't listen to them!
2006-12-03T11:49:00.000Z	sain	wceoscar	i like xmms
2006-12-03T12:00:00.000Z	sain	wceoscar	there is a setting in options for what mixer channel controls the volume
2006-12-03T12:02:00.000Z	wceoscar	sain	whats that setting?
2006-12-03T12:03:00.000Z	sain	wceoscar	options->preferences Then configure the output plugin under the Audio I/O plugins tab
2006-12-03T12:04:00.000Z	wceoscar	sain	there is no output plugin in the list...
2006-12-03T12:04:00.000Z	sain	wceoscar	well that could be a problem :)
2006-12-03T12:04:00.000Z	wceoscar	sain	i just found it
2006-12-03T12:05:00.000Z	wceoscar	sain	just fixed it
2006-12-03T12:05:00.000Z	sain	wceoscar	well then crank that puppy up
2006-12-03T12:06:00.000Z	sain	wceoscar	well first, i'd recommend formatting with fat32 if you want windows interoperability
2006-12-03T12:08:00.000Z	wceoscar	sain	i know that.. im sharing the space with windows... how can i partition the drive with fat?
2006-12-03T12:09:00.000Z	sain	wceoscar	well you could use the install disk, would be easiest
2006-12-03T12:27:00.000Z	sain	wceoscar	you mean your console fonts?
2006-12-03T12:27:00.000Z	sain	wceoscar	i think there is a console-tools package or similar that helps to tweak such things
2006-12-03T12:29:00.000Z	sain	wceoscar	try console-tools maybe
2006-12-03T12:30:00.000Z	sain	wceoscar	dunno, but it's around
2006-12-03T12:31:00.000Z	sain	wceoscar	ah, follow Vorbote's advice ... not mine :)
