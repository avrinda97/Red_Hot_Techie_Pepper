2005-04-26T11:09:00.000Z	Zotnix		Hrm... how do I mount an mp3 player?
2005-04-26T11:09:00.000Z	Zotnix		Nope
2005-04-26T11:09:00.000Z	Zotnix		I can't find it in /dev/
2005-04-26T11:10:00.000Z	Zotnix		My other friend's mp3 automounted and it was /dev/sda
2005-04-26T11:11:00.000Z	Zotnix		It waited for the "device to settle"
2005-04-26T11:11:00.000Z	Zotnix		Type:   Direct-Access                      ANSI SCSI revision: 02
2005-04-26T11:11:00.000Z	Zotnix		Did that
2005-04-26T11:11:00.000Z	Zotnix		And then nothing.
2005-04-26T11:11:00.000Z	Zotnix		Hrm.
2005-04-26T11:11:00.000Z	Zotnix		A USB mp3 player. 128 MB
2005-04-26T11:12:00.000Z	Jurku	Zotnix	what does dmesg say?
2005-04-26T11:12:00.000Z	Zotnix	Jurku	in #flood
2005-04-26T11:12:00.000Z	Jurku	Zotnix	ok,,
2005-04-26T11:13:00.000Z	Jurku	Zotnix	do you have /dev/scsi/ ?
2005-04-26T11:14:00.000Z	Jurku	Zotnix	my mp3 player goes some place like /dev/scsi/host0/lun0/disc ...
2005-04-26T11:16:00.000Z	Jurku	Zotnix	are you sure that dmesg doesn't say anything else about that mp3 player?
2005-04-26T11:16:00.000Z	Zotnix	Jurku	That is all it says.
2005-04-26T11:18:00.000Z	Jurku	Zotnix	please give a full path..
2005-04-26T11:20:00.000Z	Jurku	Zotnix	try mounting that :)
2005-04-26T11:21:00.000Z	Zotnix	Jurku	Doesn't work.
2005-04-26T11:23:00.000Z	Jurku	Zotnix	ok, I'm running out of ideas then, sorry :)
