2005-08-31T15:36:00.000Z	nicholaspaul		cafeugo_... yea... i should have pointed the browser to the folder and clicked the file. Also i had trouble with 'any' file labelled testphp.php for some reason. Renaming it was fine!!

2005-08-31T15:44:00.000Z	Jowi	nicholaspaul	i installed tcpspy. it logs all internet traffic (including from which machine accessed which webpage)
2005-08-31T15:46:00.000Z	Jowi	nicholaspaul	its a daemon. runs silently. it logs all connections to /var/log/syslog i think. it will show you date/time - from ip - to ip - www/ftp/etc
2005-08-31T15:47:00.000Z	Jowi	nicholaspaul	it even say "www:216.239.59.99 (google)" or something like that. i haven't looked for awhile since i am the only user herer
2005-09-01T16:06:00.000Z	Jowi	nicholaspaul	haha,i sure hope! the thing i hate most in the whole world is peoples kids screaming non-stop on the bus - especially if my mp3 is out of batteries. drives me nuts :-D
