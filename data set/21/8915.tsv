2006-07-06T15:01:00.000Z	wildman	NeedHelp	then sound works, the pb is elsewhere
2006-07-06T15:03:00.000Z	wildman	NeedHelp	I don't understand why u'd want to change sound driver when u do get the drums sound at login...
2006-07-06T15:04:00.000Z	wildman	NeedHelp	oh, didn't u said before that you do hear the drums?
2006-07-06T15:05:00.000Z	wildman	NeedHelp	sudo lsmod | grep snd, returns empty?
2006-07-06T15:06:00.000Z	wildman	NeedHelp	put the "|grep snd" part?
2006-07-06T15:08:00.000Z	wildman	NeedHelp	so the "lsmod | grep snd" returns something, and not empty?
2006-07-06T15:08:00.000Z	wildman	NeedHelp	cuz if it does, sound drivers should be loaded fine, and all shuold be working :-|
2006-07-06T15:19:00.000Z	wildman	NeedHelp	sudo mount device_name mount_point
2006-07-06T15:28:00.000Z	wildman	NeedHelp	/dev/hdc is the device name then
2006-07-06T15:32:00.000Z	wildman	NeedHelp	by copying former line from /etc/fstab adapting to new device name
2006-07-06T15:40:00.000Z	wildman	NeedHelp	all working fine now?
