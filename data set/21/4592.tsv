2008-03-27T00:30:00.000Z	gamma-k		Does anyone know what this is: First I switch user and later logout. The screen goes plain white. I can't see a login prompt or anything, to use the other account. Should that be?
2008-03-27T00:31:00.000Z	lusepuster	gamma-k	I've had the same problem. Does it happen using desktop Effects only, or also when they are turned entirely off?
2008-03-27T00:32:00.000Z	gamma-k	lusepuster	I haven't changed anything. Everything is default, as just installed, I believe.
2008-03-27T00:33:00.000Z	lusepuster	gamma-k	But are your desktop effects enabled?
2008-03-27T00:33:00.000Z	gamma-k	lusepuster	But I'll give it a try!
2008-03-27T00:33:00.000Z	gamma-k	lusepuster	No idea :) Probably yes.
2008-03-27T00:34:00.000Z	lusepuster	gamma-k	Not that I know how to fix it... But for me, the bug only occurs when I have the effects turned on.
2008-03-27T00:36:00.000Z	gamma-k	lusepuster	You seem to be right. No problem now, as I turned effects off. Strange it doesn't work the same on default settings
2008-03-27T00:38:00.000Z	lusepuster	gamma-k	I think it is related to which virtual display is used. I'm afraid compiz isn't as mature in that respect as Metacity.
2008-03-27T00:38:00.000Z	gamma-k	lusepuster	Thanks for that
2008-03-27T00:41:00.000Z	lusepuster	gamma-k	sorry :) Compiz is the program that handles the windows when effects are switched on, Metacity does it when effects are switched off. Compiz has way more features (the effects, for example), but Metacuity is older, more stable and more mature.
2008-03-27T00:42:00.000Z	gamma-k	lusepuster	I see. :) So I don√§t have to start finding those applications, they already exist! Thanks for the advice.
2008-03-27T00:44:00.000Z	lusepuster	gamma-k	yep, they are an integrate part of your system. The bad news is, I dopn't know how to fix it, it is probably an immaturity in the design of Compiz...
2008-03-27T00:45:00.000Z	gamma-k	lusepuster	Well, I don't consider it a huge problem for me. I'll manage without the effects.
2008-03-27T00:46:00.000Z	gamma-k	lusepuster	By the way, is it the same applications doing the work regardless of the interface? Gnome or KDE I mean. I do not know what they are called.
2008-03-27T00:49:00.000Z	lusepuster	gamma-k	They are called Window managers... because they manage your windows ;-) Metacity is the default for Gnome, KWin is the default for KDE. Compiz (and beryl but that's merged with compiz today) does the work when the desktop effects are switched on. KWin for KDE4 has a lot of desktop effects too, but it is not yet as stable as compiz - which in turn is less stable than metacity and KWin 3
2008-03-27T00:52:00.000Z	gamma-k	lusepuster	Ok, thanks. So there is an analogy :)  I'm not going to change to KDE or any other at this point. Just curious and willing to learn. Learn fast. Impatience, you see.
2008-03-27T00:52:00.000Z	lusepuster	gamma-k	impatience is my middle name :) But, I think at this point there is only two options:
2008-03-27T00:53:00.000Z	lusepuster	gamma-k	switch off effects or live with the bug until the effect software matures.
2008-03-27T00:53:00.000Z	gamma-k	lusepuster	I will do them both!
2008-03-27T00:55:00.000Z	gamma-k	lusepuster	Thanks for your advice. Gotta go. Later!
