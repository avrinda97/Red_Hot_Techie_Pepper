2008-10-24T04:20:00.000Z	csilk	Jake_	use this command>  ps -A | grep “nessusd”
2008-10-24T04:21:00.000Z	csilk	Jake_	 and tell me what output you get
2008-10-24T04:22:00.000Z	csilk	Jake_	 in that case you don't have the server/daemon installed
2008-10-24T04:22:00.000Z	csilk	Jake_	 which means there is nothing to connect to
2008-10-24T04:23:00.000Z	csilk	Jake_	Sorry this isn't a nessus support channel, I advise you read the documentation, nessus is a complex piece of software, I can't imagine anyone is going to hold your hand through the whole thing
