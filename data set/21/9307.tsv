2005-10-09T16:25:00.000Z	ghb	dwuerz	If you type "acpi=off noacpi", it should be able to boot. At least it works for me when I use it...

2005-10-09T16:25:00.000Z	ghb	dwuerz	You got a laptop?
2005-10-09T16:25:00.000Z	ghb	dwuerz	Hmm. No idea, to be frank. I'm new to Linux too.
2005-10-09T16:26:00.000Z	dwuerz	ghb	hold on I'll try again...i always put noapic...maybe noacpi works ;)
2005-10-09T16:27:00.000Z	ghb	dwuerz	Ah. That might be the problem. =)
2005-10-09T16:29:00.000Z	ghb	dwuerz	You typed "acpi=off noacpi", right?
