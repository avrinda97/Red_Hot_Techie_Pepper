2008-06-03T11:04:00.000Z	soldats	viyyer	a long shot could be some type of malfunction on the motherboard. maybe a gnarly powerloss or something.
2008-06-03T11:07:00.000Z	viyyer	soldats	this has been again and again for last 5-6 months. on both gutsy and hardy
2008-06-03T11:07:00.000Z	viyyer	soldats	just a couple of minutes ago my box rebooted
2008-06-03T11:08:00.000Z	soldats	viyyer	it sounds like it could be a power adapter connection problem
2008-06-03T11:08:00.000Z	viyyer	soldats	when this happens the screen dims and brightens back.. also the battery indicator show's not connected and connects back
2008-06-03T11:09:00.000Z	viyyer	soldats	and there is a click kinda sound
2008-06-03T11:10:00.000Z	soldats	viyyer	yes that deffinitely sounds like a bad DC connection on the motherboard. especially if it shows battery then doesnt show it. its possible that it could hurt the battery as well as the heat synch
2008-06-03T11:10:00.000Z	viyyer	soldats	what could be the solution?
2008-06-03T11:11:00.000Z	soldats	viyyer	you should have the DC jack checked out at a local computer shop. if its loose it could hurt it bad. they will usually visually inspect it for free. its your best bet id say
2008-06-03T11:21:00.000Z	viyyer	soldats	thanks.. I had a different power cable.. it worked fine
2008-06-03T11:23:00.000Z	soldats	viyyer	thats good, just for future notice if it acts up you could really damamge the motherboard so just in case if you have spare time id still get a quick check on it
2008-06-03T11:23:00.000Z	viyyer	soldats	you mean have a quick check on my motherboard?
2008-06-03T11:24:00.000Z	soldats	viyyer	no just a visual check of the DC jack. it takes seconds and is usually free
2008-06-03T11:25:00.000Z	viyyer	soldats	I am not sure about the dc jack.. but the wire from the adapter is slightly cut. that could be a reason ?
2008-06-03T11:26:00.000Z	soldats	viyyer	yes that could be it, im sure youll be fine, but if it acts up in the future remember my advice
2008-06-03T11:26:00.000Z	viyyer	soldats	sure thanks a million..
2008-06-03T11:26:00.000Z	viyyer	soldats	I was worried about the MB being affected
2008-06-03T11:27:00.000Z	soldats	viyyer	well if nothing else happens you should be fine just make sure you notice these things. something could still be wrong but not apparent at the moment, if you notice the battery not gaining a charge get it checked
2008-06-03T11:38:00.000Z	viyyer	soldats	its not acting up for now..
2008-06-03T11:39:00.000Z	soldats	viyyer	ok good, well hope everything is fine now, if you need something you know where to come
2008-06-03T11:39:00.000Z	viyyer	soldats	sure
