2005-04-19T06:56:00.000Z	dcraven	imperfect-	not that I suggest you do that, but that's what I ended up doing.
2005-04-19T07:01:00.000Z	dcraven	imperfect-	same deal with me. Booted from the CD, ended up using Smart Boot Manager as there was a (weak) BIOS password at the time with CD boot disabled. But then the installer would early on say "Looking for CDROM drivers.." or something, then fail.
2005-04-19T07:02:00.000Z	dcraven	imperfect-	*It* broke your Windows install?
2005-04-19T07:02:00.000Z	imperfect-	dcraven	; Yep
2005-04-19T07:03:00.000Z	imperfect-	dcraven	; I never got to install anything
2005-04-19T07:03:00.000Z	dcraven	imperfect-	you played no part in that?
2005-04-19T07:03:00.000Z	imperfect-	dcraven	: Not unless booting up the ubuntu CD and trying to detect the CDROM did it.
2005-04-19T07:03:00.000Z	imperfect-	dcraven	; Which it didn't.
2005-04-19T07:04:00.000Z	dcraven	imperfect-	slam in the XP CD and do a repair. It'll work.
2005-04-19T07:04:00.000Z	imperfect-	dcraven	: I dont care enough about it to do that.
2005-04-19T07:04:00.000Z	imperfect-	dcraven	; my powerbook is still working fine ;)
2005-04-19T07:04:00.000Z	dcraven	imperfect-	heh
2005-04-19T07:05:00.000Z	dcraven	imperfect-	that's what I said on Sept 8th, 2001. I still haven't gotten around to fixing that old Windows install.
2005-04-26T05:06:00.000Z	dcraven	imperfect-	did you install gstreamer0.8-mad from universe?
2005-04-26T05:06:00.000Z	imperfect-	dcraven	streamer is being held back it says
2005-04-26T05:08:00.000Z	dcraven	imperfect-	if it is held back it means you need to do a dist-upgrade.
2005-04-26T05:09:00.000Z	imperfect-	dcraven	that's how I got to hoary to begin with.
2005-04-26T05:09:00.000Z	dcraven	imperfect-	well you may need to run it again.
2005-04-26T05:09:00.000Z	imperfect-	dcraven	That's what I'm saying -- I just tried it again and it didn't do anything.
2005-04-26T05:10:00.000Z	dcraven	imperfect-	okay.
