2010-03-11T19:13:00.000Z	Halitech	khafiz	then they may have restored the hard drive, did you watch them while they worked?
2010-03-11T19:14:00.000Z	khafiz	Halitech	nope, i left my laptop for 2 weeks for the repairement
2010-03-11T19:15:00.000Z	Halitech	khafiz	so you don't know what they did then ... check windows disk management and see if there is still an unknown partition
2010-03-11T19:16:00.000Z	khafiz	Halitech	one moment pls
2010-03-11T19:20:00.000Z	khafiz	Halitech	u may check this http://imagebin.org/88457

2010-03-11T19:21:00.000Z	Halitech	khafiz	the 9.3gig partitions could be your ubuntu install ... do you still have an Ubuntu desktop cd?
2010-03-11T19:22:00.000Z	Halitech	khafiz	try booting from that and see what is on those partitions, if it is your install then you just need to restore grub
2010-03-11T19:27:00.000Z	khafiz	Halitech	i stil have my ubuntu cd.. how am i going to check if its stil on my hd?
2010-03-11T19:28:00.000Z	Halitech	khafiz	boot from the live cd and mount the partitions and see what is on them
2010-03-11T19:29:00.000Z	khafiz	Halitech	im new. how am i going to mount it?
2010-03-11T19:29:00.000Z	Halitech	khafiz	look in the places menu and you should see them
