2011-07-05T18:50:00.000Z	joeyJoel_		Hi, can I get some help w/ubuntu
2011-07-05T18:51:00.000Z	joeyJoel_		Sorry, my first time here
2011-07-05T18:51:00.000Z	joeyJoel_		Hi, I have a MAC G4, single 125 gig processor, dual mirror door, that went bad.  I downloaded  ubuntu, burned it to a cd, but it does not boot, or run... I like help in 1`, getting it to be correct in format, and 2, installing it on my mac
2011-07-05T18:52:00.000Z	corrytonapple	joeyJoel_	Its fine.  Anyway, how did it go bad?
2011-07-05T18:54:00.000Z	corrytonapple	joeyJoel_	I did not know that.  I though Acer laptops were pretty easy to convert
2011-07-05T18:55:00.000Z	corrytonapple	joeyJoel_	 You mean like you are willing to, or that is what you are getting?
2011-07-05T18:59:00.000Z	corrytonapple	joeyJoel_	iKnow what you mean.  :)
2011-07-05T18:59:00.000Z	corrytonapple	joeyJoel_	Once sec
2011-07-05T19:01:00.000Z	corrytonapple	joeyJoel_	 Again, one sec.  I have to handle some stuff
2011-07-05T19:02:00.000Z	corrytonapple	joeyJoel_	 Anyway, try booting it.  If you cannot boot it again, try burning a new disc
2011-07-05T19:05:00.000Z	corrytonapple	joeyJoel_	 So did you extract all of the files to the root of the CD, then burn it to make it bootable?
2011-07-05T19:06:00.000Z	corrytonapple	joeyJoel_	 Did you follow the instructions on the download page for mac or windows on how to burn it to a CD?
2011-07-05T19:09:00.000Z	corrytonapple	joeyJoel_	 Okay, then let me ask you if you followed this link?
2011-07-05T19:09:00.000Z	corrytonapple	joeyJoel_	 http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/download
2011-07-05T19:11:00.000Z	corrytonapple	joeyJoel_	 That last message was ment for you
2011-07-05T19:13:00.000Z	corrytonapple	joeyJoel_	 Yeah it is.  I have tried many, but Enjoy Ubuntu for the support.
2011-07-05T19:13:00.000Z	corrytonapple	joeyJoel_	 So it just gives an error or brings you to GRUB or your bootloader.
2011-07-05T19:16:00.000Z	corrytonapple	joeyJoel_	 The .iso you just burn to the CD by following the instructions from that page.
2011-07-05T19:18:00.000Z	corrytonapple	joeyJoel_	Yes, you have to click the "Show Me How" button after you choose your settings
2011-07-05T19:18:00.000Z	corrytonapple	joeyJoel_	 I know, it is crazy
2011-07-05T19:19:00.000Z	corrytonapple	joeyJoel_	 We are trying to help.  You are not describing the problem well, so I have to try to figure it out
