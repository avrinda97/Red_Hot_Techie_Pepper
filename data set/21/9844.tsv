2005-07-02T14:00:00.000Z	pipatron	Nerull	Same kind of system, different sources.
2005-07-02T14:00:00.000Z	Nerull		Diff sources what do you mean by that ?
2005-07-02T14:00:00.000Z	Nerull		Like i cant use my isp apt-mirror ? :S
2005-07-02T14:01:00.000Z	pipatron	Nerull	Not if you want a true ubuntu system, no
2005-07-02T14:02:00.000Z	pipatron	Nerull	But your ISP should set up some caching proxy instead
2005-07-02T14:02:00.000Z	Nerull	pipatron	so what are the main diffs between debian and ubuntu =
2005-07-02T14:02:00.000Z	Nerull		?

2005-07-02T14:02:00.000Z	pipatron	Nerull	*if* you stick to the ubuntu packages.

2005-07-02T14:03:00.000Z	pipatron	Nerull	DO the other way around
2005-07-02T14:03:00.000Z	pipatron	Nerull	Ubuntu is targeted to desktops
