2009-11-02T10:18:00.000Z	krishna		is it possible to download the vmlinuz file alone and replace my corrupted vmlinuz ????? anyone help//
2009-11-02T10:18:00.000Z	Greybeard	krishna	you can download the deb package and extract it
2009-11-02T10:38:00.000Z	Greybeard	krishna	what was the command?
2009-11-02T10:40:00.000Z	Greybeard	krishna	that's a very odd command
2009-11-02T10:41:00.000Z	krishna	Greybeard	it copied 910_GL_STACK=1 into vmlinuz file.. and vmlinuz only now has this line
2009-11-02T10:41:00.000Z	Greybeard	krishna	exactly
2009-11-02T10:41:00.000Z	Greybeard	krishna	yeah, that would definitely make your system unbootable
2009-11-02T10:41:00.000Z	krishna	Greybeard	ops must ban his ip
2009-11-02T10:41:00.000Z	Greybeard	krishna	well, it's such an odd command I'm not sure it was malicious
2009-11-02T10:42:00.000Z	krishna	Greybeard	 it WAS malicious.. it replaced the contents of my working vmlinuz file :P ... and Jordan_U helped me to get the image installed.. and its downloading
2009-11-02T10:43:00.000Z	Greybeard	krishna	well, yeah, it may have been malicious, I just wonder if he was very confused and trying to put the text somewhere else
2009-11-02T10:44:00.000Z	krishna	Greybeard	he gave the same echo  and > to are_ee that broke his vmlinuz too
2009-11-02T10:44:00.000Z	Greybeard	krishna	yeah, definitely seems suspicious
2009-11-02T10:44:00.000Z	krishna	Greybeard	 isnt > output redirection operator ??? :P ,,  it directed the output of echo into that file.. ha hah ah .. ! i know this already... but in a hurry..  i blinding posted his command into my terminal
2009-11-02T10:50:00.000Z	Greybeard	krishna	that looks like a Linux build configuration line related to Intel video
2009-11-02T10:51:00.000Z	krishna	Greybeard	then shall i try appending it now ? what do you think ?
2009-11-02T10:52:00.000Z	Greybeard	krishna	don't touch your vmlinuz file
2009-11-02T10:52:00.000Z	krishna	Greybeard	ok :P i have learnt that already.. he he
2009-11-02T10:52:00.000Z	Greybeard	krishna	that string may be useful when you're configuring Linux to build it
2009-11-02T11:14:00.000Z	krishna	Greybeard	i got my vmlinuz restored.. now in my 9.10 only
2009-11-02T11:14:00.000Z	Greybeard	krishna	good
