2008-05-15T20:55:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Kl4m	s/bug/sabotage/
2008-06-04T01:32:00.000Z	Kl4m	gordonjcp	huh what would you later use
2008-06-04T01:34:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Kl4m	64-bit wep, or no encryption at all on the air interface, and tunnel everything over ipsec
2008-06-04T01:34:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Kl4m	I don't see the point in using WPA at all - it's painfully slow and only a bit harder to crack than WEP
2008-06-04T01:35:00.000Z	Kl4m	gordonjcp	WEP? oh please. WPA2 is AES encryption, very secure, and no home users want to setup a VPN
2008-06-04T01:36:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Kl4m	no home user will be bothered setting up full-on WPA2 and an auth server
2008-06-04T01:37:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Kl4m	if you're using any kind of wireless networking, and you're not tunnelling your traffic, then you're basically shouting it in the clear
2008-06-04T01:37:00.000Z	Kl4m	gordonjcp	WPA2 with a pre-shared key, or course.
2008-06-04T01:37:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Kl4m	PSK is trivial to break
2008-06-04T01:37:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Kl4m	takes about an hour, even assuming there isn't a quicker way
2008-06-04T01:37:00.000Z	Kl4m	gordonjcp	I think you're mixed up in your concepts. there is nothing to "break" in a PSK.
2008-06-04T01:38:00.000Z	Kl4m	gordonjcp	except brute-forcing it
2008-06-04T01:38:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Kl4m	yup
2008-06-04T01:38:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Kl4m	you grab two parts of the four-way handshake, and wave a rainbow table at it
2008-06-04T01:38:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Kl4m	bang, you're in
2008-06-04T01:38:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Kl4m	like I say, takes about an hour
2008-06-04T01:40:00.000Z	Kl4m	gordonjcp	go read some more. WPA2 with an appropriate PSK is fully secure (as far as known today)
2008-06-04T01:41:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Kl4m	keep telling yourself that
2008-06-04T01:43:00.000Z	Kl4m	gordonjcp	the only known attacks against AES are "side-channel" which I'm not exactly affraid of yet. Now I have to go.
