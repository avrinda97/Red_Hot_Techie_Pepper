2010-05-03T22:57:00.000Z	Shapeshifter		Uhm, guys. I'm feeling stupid. I don't see how I can shut down this thing from the GUI. sure reboot works as root but I only see this "log out user" applet in the bar and there I can only log out or switch users. but not shut down
2010-05-03T22:58:00.000Z	geekphreak	Shapeshifter	 , press ctrl+alt+del
2010-05-03T22:58:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	geekphreak	huh. what should that even do. ctrl-alt-del seems to be disabled in ubuntu. in any case, I'm asking about a button. a menu. a "shutdown" thing.
2010-05-03T22:59:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	geekphreak	apart from that, ctrl-alt-del used to be reboot. not shutdown
2010-05-03T22:59:00.000Z	geekphreak	Shapeshifter	it gives shutdown too, this aint windows
2010-05-03T23:00:00.000Z	geekphreak	Shapeshifter	else right click panel on empty area>>add to panel >> add shutdown widget
2010-05-03T23:00:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	geekphreak	nothing happens when I press ctrl-alt-del. Also, what has this to do with windows? ctrl-alt-del has been reboot on linux for "decades". and on winows, it's the taskmanager or something
2010-05-03T23:00:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	geekphreak	I don't have a shutdown widget
2010-05-03T23:00:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	geekphreak	oh look. now the menu appeared. a minute late.
2010-05-03T23:01:00.000Z	geekphreak	Shapeshifter	 :p
2010-05-03T23:01:00.000Z	geekphreak	Shapeshifter	 there is 1 more thing you can do
2010-05-03T23:13:00.000Z	geekphreak	Shapeshifter	excuse me?
2010-05-03T23:13:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	geekphreak	as I said...
2010-05-03T23:13:00.000Z	geekphreak	Shapeshifter	open terminal , sudo poweroff
2010-05-03T23:14:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	geekphreak	ActionParsnip: those are not solutions to the problem.
2010-05-03T23:14:00.000Z	geekphreak	Shapeshifter	 did you update, or fresh install?
2010-05-03T23:14:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	geekphreak	fresh install. I thought I'd try out ubuntu again.
2010-05-03T23:15:00.000Z	geekphreak	Shapeshifter	 on fresh install it should be ok umm, did you uninstall anything or play with any settings?
2010-05-03T23:15:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	geekphreak	I didn't do anything. It was like this from the very first startup
2010-05-03T23:35:00.000Z	geekphreak	Shapeshifter	 /var/log
2010-05-03T23:35:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	geekphreak	well all three of them are not there....
