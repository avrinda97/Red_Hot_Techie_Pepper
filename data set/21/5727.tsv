2007-12-01T21:55:00.000Z	dutchie86	Legendario	Do you know the make and model of the card?
2007-12-01T21:56:00.000Z	Legendario	dutchie86	it is a generic 64 bits board with a creative chip
2007-12-01T21:57:00.000Z	dutchie86	Legendario	did it get picked up when you booted it from the livecd for the install?
2007-12-01T21:59:00.000Z	Legendario	dutchie86	i disabled the onboard card and installed the pci one
2007-12-01T22:00:00.000Z	dutchie86	Legendario	after the install?
2007-12-01T22:00:00.000Z	Legendario	dutchie86	it didn't work
2007-12-01T22:01:00.000Z	dutchie86	Legendario	did you swap the card after you had ubuntu installed?
2007-12-01T22:01:00.000Z	Legendario	dutchie86	yes
2007-12-01T22:01:00.000Z	dutchie86	Legendario	so you are trying to get that card to work?
2007-12-01T22:01:00.000Z	Legendario	dutchie86	yes

2007-12-01T22:03:00.000Z	dutchie86	Legendario	excuse the silly questions, 2am here in Australia :), did you go through the proccess of installing it
2007-12-01T22:04:00.000Z	Legendario	dutchie86	installing what? the new card? sure thing! (don't worry cause i am in brazil)

2007-12-01T22:07:00.000Z	Legendario	dutchie86	i didn't do a thing. i was expecting ubuntu to recognize it like on a live-cd session
