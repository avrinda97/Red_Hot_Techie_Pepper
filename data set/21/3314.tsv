2009-01-29T09:59:00.000Z	Fezzler	jtal	xkill on command line?
2009-01-29T09:59:00.000Z	jtal	Fezzler	yes
2009-01-29T10:00:00.000Z	Fezzler	jtal	didn't work
2009-01-29T10:01:00.000Z	jtal	Fezzler	ps aux | grep <your prog name>
2009-01-29T10:01:00.000Z	jtal	Fezzler	then kill <process id>
2009-01-29T10:01:00.000Z	Fezzler	jtal	I get process ID from top, right?
2009-01-29T10:02:00.000Z	jtal	Fezzler	top or from ps
2009-01-29T10:02:00.000Z	jtal	Fezzler	if you're looking for firefox you could do:  ps aux | grep firefox
2009-01-29T10:03:00.000Z	jtal	Fezzler	you may have to kill more than one process- what are you killing anyway?
2009-01-29T10:05:00.000Z	jtal	Fezzler	did you do ps aux | grep palm  (or something similar?)
2009-01-29T10:05:00.000Z	Fezzler	jtal	will now
2009-01-29T10:07:00.000Z	Fezzler	jtal	still stuck
2009-01-29T10:07:00.000Z	Fezzler	jtal	It's gnome-pilot settings
2009-01-29T10:07:00.000Z	Fezzler	jtal	just finished unsuccessful sync.  frozen
2009-01-29T10:07:00.000Z	jtal	Fezzler	did you do kill ps_id ?
2009-01-29T10:08:00.000Z	Fezzler	jtal	didn't work.  response was 1000 was not the ID
2009-01-29T10:09:00.000Z	jtal	Fezzler	are you sure you used the ps id? from ps command?
2009-01-29T10:10:00.000Z	Fezzler	jtal	 I ran "ps aux | grep palm"
2009-01-29T10:10:00.000Z	jtal	Fezzler	replace "palm" with whatever you think might be in the command name- like pilot
2009-01-29T10:12:00.000Z	Fezzler	jtal	Bingo.  Thanks
