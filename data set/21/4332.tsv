2008-05-13T23:55:00.000Z	ringer		i am running live cd right now and want to delete my old 7.10 partitions to install 8.04, how do i do this
2008-05-13T23:55:00.000Z	InvisiblePinkUni	ringer	Don't you want anything from your old 7.10?
2008-05-13T23:55:00.000Z	ringer	InvisiblePinkUni	no i dont need anything from that.
2008-05-13T23:56:00.000Z	InvisiblePinkUni	ringer	Then after you boot in the livecd, go to the partition editor, and you can delete the partition.
2008-05-13T23:57:00.000Z	ringer	InvisiblePinkUni	i am trying, but my swap and extended partitions are locked or something and cannot be deleted
2008-05-13T23:57:00.000Z	InvisiblePinkUni	ringer	Or reformat it to ext3 again.
2008-05-13T23:57:00.000Z	InvisiblePinkUni	ringer	dont touch swap and extended partitions.
2008-05-13T23:58:00.000Z	InvisiblePinkUni	ringer	Why do you want to delete the whole thing and install fresh?
2008-05-13T23:59:00.000Z	ringer	InvisiblePinkUni	because i was having sound problems and figured this was the best way to solve it.  i was running 8.04 last night and it worked perfectly, i just messed up all my partitions and now i dont know what i am doing.
2008-05-13T23:59:00.000Z	ringer	InvisiblePinkUni	so i would like to just reinstall and correct all of my partitions.
2008-05-14T00:00:00.000Z	InvisiblePinkUni	ringer	Normally, you do all the partition stuff first and then install ubuntu.
2008-05-14T00:00:00.000Z	ringer	InvisiblePinkUni	yeah i know, i was actually doing it manually with the partition editor while installing, but i messed it up through there
2008-05-14T00:01:00.000Z	InvisiblePinkUni	ringer	If you use liveCD you should be able to delete all partitions.
2008-05-14T00:04:00.000Z	ringer	InvisiblePinkUni	i have my xp partition and an extended and swap partitions, what should i do during installation
2008-05-14T00:05:00.000Z	InvisiblePinkUni	ringer	Do you want to keep your XP?
2008-05-14T00:06:00.000Z	ringer	InvisiblePinkUni	yes, for a little while longer anyways
2008-05-14T00:07:00.000Z	InvisiblePinkUni	ringer	Ok, boot liveCD, go to partition editor, delete extended and swap (hoping you dont need them). Then reformat available space as ext3, and then 2*RAM size as swap.
2008-05-14T00:07:00.000Z	InvisiblePinkUni	ringer	After that is done, then proceed to installing ubuntu.
2008-05-14T00:11:00.000Z	InvisiblePinkUni	ringer	Is the swap size ok now? like is it double your RAM?
2008-05-14T00:11:00.000Z	InvisiblePinkUni	ringer	If it is, then just leave it as it is.
2008-05-14T00:11:00.000Z	InvisiblePinkUni	ringer	just reformat extended. delete it and make it ext3
