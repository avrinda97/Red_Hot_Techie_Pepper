2011-01-12T05:02:00.000Z	dffd		wont let me make a copy of /etc/
2011-01-12T05:03:00.000Z	dffd		Most settings are in your home folder (in hidden folders) and system wide configuration files are in /etc/ (you'll only need to backup files from /etc/ which you edited yourself). If you backup these you should be able to reset most of you're current settings in your new install.
2011-01-12T05:03:00.000Z	dffd		this is really stupid. how can an entire install be screwed up from me installing 2 or 3 packages. i want my desktop back
2011-01-12T05:04:00.000Z	sam-_-	dffd	and we may help if you tell us specifics about the problem
2011-01-12T05:04:00.000Z	sam-_-	dffd	i doubt it's because of the installed packaged
2011-01-12T05:04:00.000Z	sam-_-	dffd	i doubt it's because of the installed packages
2011-01-12T05:05:00.000Z	sam-_-	dffd	so you are dropped to console on boot now?
2011-01-12T05:05:00.000Z	sam-_-	dffd	ask for password where? on a tty?
2011-01-12T05:06:00.000Z	sam-_-	dffd	then try: sudo restart gdm
2011-01-12T05:08:00.000Z	sam-_-	dffd	which version of ubuntu? or are you using kubuntu?
2011-01-12T05:10:00.000Z	sam-_-	dffd	oh then upgrade because 7.10 isn't supported anymore
2011-01-12T05:11:00.000Z	sam-_-	dffd	hopefully
2011-01-12T05:11:00.000Z	sam-_-	dffd	can't promise anything because 7.10 is quite old
2011-01-12T05:11:00.000Z	sam-_-	dffd	lsb_release -a|grep -i release
2011-01-12T05:11:00.000Z	sam-_-	dffd	see if you really have 7.10
2011-01-12T05:14:00.000Z	sam-_-	dffd	what dw- said but in the root directory of your install
2011-01-12T05:14:00.000Z	sam-_-	dffd	you have to mount your install first
2011-01-12T05:18:00.000Z	sam-_-	dffd	you have to mount the root fs of your installed system
2011-01-12T05:18:00.000Z	sam-_-	dffd	there go to the etc folder
2011-01-12T05:19:00.000Z	sam-_-	dffd	there should be a file in there called lsb-release
2011-01-12T05:21:00.000Z	sam-_-	dffd	no you want to mount a harddisk
