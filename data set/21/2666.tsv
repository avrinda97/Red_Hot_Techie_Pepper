2010-06-01T17:59:00.000Z	rocket16	jrib	We can, because if application is genuine, no virus should be there
2010-06-01T17:59:00.000Z	jrib	rocket16	no idea what you mean by "genuine" but why would you ever need or want to sudo wine?
2010-06-01T18:00:00.000Z	rocket16	jrib	Because in some cases, it might be requiring Write access to configuration of System for setting graphics
2010-06-01T18:00:00.000Z	jrib	rocket16	name one case
2010-06-01T18:01:00.000Z	rocket16	jrib	One such case is the case of Age of Mythology Gold edition, which needs Graphics library to be modified. It worked fine with sudo
2010-06-01T18:02:00.000Z	jrib	rocket16	applications run in wine should never need to touch anything outside of ~/.wine
2010-06-01T18:02:00.000Z	rocket16	jrib	But if it is a Commercial Antivirus, , whose Linux version isn't released?
2010-06-01T18:03:00.000Z	jrib	rocket16	the applications don't know anything about wine.  To them ~/.wine/drive_c and whatever wine makes available to them is the system
2010-06-01T18:04:00.000Z	jrib	rocket16	I imagine that all that will happen with sudo wine is you mess up permissions
2010-06-02T18:31:00.000Z	jrib	rocket16	please don't recommend that
2010-06-02T18:32:00.000Z	jrib	rocket16	(logging in graphically as root)
2010-06-02T18:32:00.000Z	rocket16	jrib	Recommend what??
2010-06-02T18:33:00.000Z	rocket16	jrib	Well, that is a literal answer. Also, most malwares won't even run in root. For example, Puppy Linux uses root, still no malwares won't run. Aditionally, I answered to the point.
2010-06-02T18:35:00.000Z	jrib	rocket16	just give the root and sudo factoids please.  Logging in graphically as root is a security risk, especially for users who are asking that type of question
2010-06-02T18:35:00.000Z	rocket16	jrib	I understand. I was just going to specify the risks too.
2010-09-18T02:32:00.000Z	jrib	rocket16	maybe gnome-session-save, otherwise you likely have to mess with dbus to get gdm to turn off the computer (I'm fairly certain this is how it worked at some point)
2010-11-11T23:13:00.000Z	jrib	rocket16	that's not a good reason to compile a kernel, no
2010-11-11T23:15:00.000Z	rocket16	jrib	I see. I read that Ubuntu kernel is too huge and unwieldy, and recompiling it will increase the performance to a small extent. If I try it, will there be any problem related to my current OS?
2010-11-11T23:15:00.000Z	jrib	rocket16	nope, you can try it and see
2010-11-11T23:16:00.000Z	rocket16	jrib	Oh, many thanks. :)
