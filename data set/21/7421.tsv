2006-10-05T14:22:00.000Z	wrabbit^		hi everybody.  Pardon the typos if any but my refresh rate is all screwy and I have tiny little letters.  Is there a SIMPLE way to change the refresh rate?  I'd like to run it at 1024x768 at 60 - 75 but the only refresh rate option for 1024x768 I have in display settings is 85 and it's horrible

2006-10-05T14:58:00.000Z	oskude	wrabbit^	hs 30 - 97 KHz / vs 50-160 Hz (says the pdf)
2006-10-05T14:59:00.000Z	oskude	wrabbit^	write them down...
2006-10-05T15:01:00.000Z	wrabbit^	oskude	 30 - 97Khz / vs 50-160Hz? what comes before the 30
2006-10-05T15:01:00.000Z	oskude	wrabbit^	horizontal
2006-10-05T15:02:00.000Z	wrabbit^	oskude	ah right, thanks
2006-10-05T05:24:00.000Z	wrabbit^	oskude	I was stuck in the command line and couldn't start X.  Eventually got the res and refresh rate working for gnome but it wouldn't show up for xfce.  So I cracked it :)
2006-10-05T05:24:00.000Z	oskude	wrabbit^	aha...
2006-10-05T05:25:00.000Z	wrabbit^	oskude	so I'm gonna give kde a go.  If I can make it as simple as xfce, I'll be happy.  I just want something that won't get in the way with flashy gfx
2006-10-05T05:58:00.000Z	oskude	wrabbit^	xfce is bloated too, use openbox :/
2006-10-05T05:59:00.000Z	wrabbit^	oskude	openbox eh... I'll check it out.
