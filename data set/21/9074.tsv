2005-11-23T14:44:00.000Z	rob_p	lightbright	 probably, yes.
2005-11-23T14:45:00.000Z	rob_p	lightbright	 chown username ./
2005-11-23T14:46:00.000Z	rob_p	lightbright	 chown username ./* will change the ownership to username for all files in the current dir.
2005-11-23T14:48:00.000Z	rob_p	lightbright	 It's always safer to specify the path when chowning or chmoding though.
2005-11-23T14:49:00.000Z	rob_p	lightbright	 It's just a good habit to be in :-)
2005-11-23T14:49:00.000Z	rob_p	lightbright	 One is the owner and the other is the group.
2005-11-23T14:50:00.000Z	rob_p	lightbright	 Every file has an owner and it also belongs to a group.
2005-11-23T14:51:00.000Z	rob_p	lightbright	 Depends on the file.
2005-11-23T14:52:00.000Z	rob_p	lightbright	 Some files are owned by one user but need to be in a different group in order to allow permissions for the members of that group to access, execute, etc. the file.
2005-11-23T14:54:00.000Z	rob_p	lightbright	 Your personal files probably should be owned by you and in your group.
2005-11-23T14:54:00.000Z	rob_p	lightbright	 There's probably no good reason for a majority of them to be in group root.
2005-11-23T14:55:00.000Z	rob_p	lightbright	 chown username /the/dir
2005-11-23T14:55:00.000Z	rob_p	lightbright	 If you want to change the group, do chown username.username /the/dir
2005-11-23T14:56:00.000Z	rob_p	lightbright	 That will change the ownership and group.
2005-11-23T14:57:00.000Z	rob_p	lightbright	 username.username
