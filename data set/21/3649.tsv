2009-07-04T10:07:00.000Z	Out_Cold		can someone explain the lack of use of wlan? why do i have eth as my wifi device?
2009-07-04T10:08:00.000Z	te_	Out_Cold	When it's fully supported it shows as eth0 or eth1
2009-07-04T10:08:00.000Z	te_	Out_Cold	Doesn't really matter, right...?
2009-07-04T10:08:00.000Z	Out_Cold	te_	i realize it operates the same but just curious as to why there is no more use of wlan..
2009-07-04T10:09:00.000Z	te_	Out_Cold	Just simplicity.
2009-07-04T10:10:00.000Z	te_	Out_Cold	From...?
2009-07-04T10:10:00.000Z	Out_Cold	te_	 started on slack lol
2009-07-04T10:11:00.000Z	te_	Out_Cold	Good for you... Yea I use slack too.  They're all good.  Fedora etc..
2009-07-04T10:11:00.000Z	Out_Cold	te_	as much as i learned from it... i am not a huge fan
2009-07-04T10:12:00.000Z	te_	Out_Cold	I'm a huge fan.  I'm about to install Yellow Dog on my son's PS3, looking forward to that too.
2009-07-04T10:13:00.000Z	Out_Cold	te_	i tried compiling on my laptop.. was a LOT of work that i couldn't always get
2009-07-04T10:13:00.000Z	te_	Out_Cold	slackbuilds does it for you.
2009-07-04T10:14:00.000Z	te_	Out_Cold	Anyway, Ubuntu is easier and has very awsome package management.
2009-07-04T10:15:00.000Z	te_	Out_Cold	Yes, everything's already compiled/built for you.  Very nice.
2009-07-04T10:23:00.000Z	te_	Out_Cold	I understand that you just hold the power button down for 3seconds to boot linux, and just punch it to boot to game.
2009-07-04T10:39:00.000Z	te_	Out_Cold	Was looking at YellowDog and appears to be very active, releases are only about 8 months apart.
2009-07-04T10:39:00.000Z	te_	Out_Cold	I'm downloading it as we speak.
2009-07-04T10:39:00.000Z	Out_Cold	te_	i'll have to check it out on the VM
2009-07-04T10:40:00.000Z	te_	Out_Cold	Oh yea, you can use VM, especially with that really big drive.
2009-07-04T10:40:00.000Z	Out_Cold	te_	you are talking about on the ps3?
2009-07-04T10:41:00.000Z	te_	Out_Cold	Yes
