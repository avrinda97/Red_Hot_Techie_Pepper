2011-01-12T09:30:00.000Z	jon8		is there away to automatically fetch updates to packages and write to a log file what was updated and when (FROM Command Line)
2011-01-12T09:30:00.000Z	jon8		I do not want to have to do apt-get update (and upgrade if available) every day
2011-01-12T09:30:00.000Z	bullgard4	jon8	Yes.
2011-01-12T09:31:00.000Z	jon8	bullgard4	care to elaborate? ;)
2011-01-12T09:31:00.000Z	bullgard4	jon8	You better elaborate.
2011-01-12T09:31:00.000Z	jon8	bullgard4	huh? you're the one that said yes.
2011-01-12T09:32:00.000Z	bullgard4	jon8	I have fully answered to the question which you have put here in this channel.
2011-01-12T09:32:00.000Z	jon8	bullgard4	you said yes, but you didnt say how it is done.
2011-01-12T09:32:00.000Z	bullgard4	jon8	This is correct.
2011-01-12T09:33:00.000Z	jon8	bullgard4	can you explain how it is done?
2011-01-12T09:34:00.000Z	bullgard4	jon8	The command 'sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade' will do that.
2011-01-12T09:35:00.000Z	jon8	bullgard4	sigh.. yes, i know this, thats what i'm doing currently. I am wondering (and i already asked) if there was something i could turn on, that will automatically do that every day or so and write to a file what it did or didnt do.
2011-01-12T09:38:00.000Z	bullgard4	jon8	If this little problem is causing you a sigh then you better see your psychologist for a treatment. --  The command will write to a file what it did. --  You should put the command in a cronjob in order that the command will be executed automatically.
2011-01-12T09:38:00.000Z	jon8	bullgard4	what file does it write to?
