2010-02-12T14:38:00.000Z	koltroll		if one have draged "stiffness" on wobbly windows up to max, so that any active windows jumps around like crazy.. what would be solution be?
2010-02-12T14:39:00.000Z	koltroll		"a friend did it".
2010-02-12T14:40:00.000Z	PingFloyd	koltroll	what do you mean?
2010-02-12T14:40:00.000Z	koltroll	PingFloyd	well I changed an advanced setting on the wobbly windows so that the window is just jumping around like crazy, totally deformed. And I like to fix it :)
2010-02-12T14:42:00.000Z	PingFloyd	koltroll	will it let you change at the same place?
2010-02-12T14:42:00.000Z	koltroll	PingFloyd	I can't change anything now since any active window starts jumping around like crazy =>
2010-02-12T14:42:00.000Z	PingFloyd	koltroll	I see
2010-02-12T14:42:00.000Z	PingFloyd	koltroll	that's in gnome?
2010-02-12T14:43:00.000Z	koltroll	PingFloyd	KDE actually
2010-02-12T14:43:00.000Z	PingFloyd	koltroll	not sure for kde, but gnome you could use the gconf-editor from command line
2010-02-12T14:44:00.000Z	koltroll	PingFloyd	thanks, I googled for gconf-editor for kde and found that it's "kwriteconfig".
2010-02-12T14:44:00.000Z	PingFloyd	koltroll	there you go :)
2010-02-12T14:44:00.000Z	PingFloyd	koltroll	I figured it must have something similar
2010-02-12T14:45:00.000Z	PingFloyd	koltroll	it's kind of funny they'd allow such a crazy setting
2010-02-12T14:46:00.000Z	PingFloyd	koltroll	you would think they would put an upper sane limit
2010-02-12T14:46:00.000Z	PingFloyd	koltroll	maybe on that setting it will stop jumping around in a day or two
2010-02-12T14:49:00.000Z	koltroll	PingFloyd	:)
2010-02-12T15:42:00.000Z	PingFloyd	koltroll	mount with loop option
2010-02-12T15:43:00.000Z	koltroll	PingFloyd	but there's gotta be some nice gui tool for this.
2010-02-12T15:43:00.000Z	PingFloyd	koltroll	I think nautilus will
2010-02-12T15:44:00.000Z	PingFloyd	koltroll	seems like nautilus will do it transparently if you have dbus/hal installed
