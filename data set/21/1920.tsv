2010-03-18T03:23:00.000Z	dmdevotee		hay people
2010-03-18T03:24:00.000Z	dmdevotee		anybody knows if there is a plugin for gnome for "bit to bit" file comparison?
2010-03-18T03:24:00.000Z	dmdevotee		or any software?
2010-03-18T03:25:00.000Z	dmdevotee		for gnome commander?
2010-03-18T03:26:00.000Z	dmdevotee		losha: yes, i mean, an app like "total commander"
2010-03-18T03:27:00.000Z	dmdevotee		there is an option into total commander that compares files, and it gives "different" or "equal"
2010-03-18T03:28:00.000Z	dmdevotee		but diff can make folders and selection?
2010-03-18T03:29:00.000Z	dmdevotee		i want a gui to do that, in fact, i am searching for a gui in every action on linux
2010-03-18T03:29:00.000Z	dmdevotee		losha, i mean, in a folder, compare some files with some files in other folder
2010-03-18T03:31:00.000Z	dmdevotee		thanks losha, but it's too uncomfortable for everyday use
2010-03-18T03:32:00.000Z	jrib	dmdevotee	what's your use case?
2010-03-18T03:34:00.000Z	jrib	dmdevotee	but *why*?
2010-03-18T03:34:00.000Z	jrib	dmdevotee	that sounds ridiculous, fix the corruption issue then :)
2010-03-18T03:35:00.000Z	jrib	dmdevotee	it really seems to me like you want to accomplish something else and think it's the best way when in fact it's probably not
2010-03-18T03:36:00.000Z	dmdevotee	jrib	in fact, i am searching for a plugin or program, that does like the "sincronice directories" of total commander
2010-03-18T03:36:00.000Z	jrib	dmdevotee	unison or rsync then
2011-07-22T16:55:00.000Z	jrib	dmdevotee	are you sure you've run "update-grub"?
2011-07-22T16:56:00.000Z	jrib	dmdevotee	pastebin your /boot/grub/grub.cfg
2011-07-22T17:02:00.000Z	jrib	dmdevotee	if you don't answer question and provide info when asked for it, we can't help you.
2011-07-22T17:03:00.000Z	dmdevotee	jrib	but i don't want to edit files, i want a software to do it easily
2011-07-22T17:04:00.000Z	jrib	dmdevotee	I see. I don't know of such a program.  But /etc/default/grub provides an option per line; I don't really see how a gui could make it any simpler
