2006-11-27T11:57:00.000Z	slowz3r	ubunjusty	right now im using wifi radar
2006-11-27T11:58:00.000Z	ubunjusty	slowz3r	I would suggest using NetworkManager. It's pretty useful if you don't want to learn how to do it via the CLI.
2006-11-27T11:58:00.000Z	slowz3r	ubunjusty	im a linux newb where can i DL that from
2006-11-27T11:59:00.000Z	ubunjusty	slowz3r	Um.  Try Synaptic.  It's under "System | Administration | Synaptic Package Manager"  That is if you are using Ubuntu,
2006-11-27T12:00:00.000Z	slowz3r		ya i am using ubuntu
2006-11-27T12:00:00.000Z	slowz3r	ubunjusty	well it says its a KDE frontend an im using GNome
2006-11-27T12:01:00.000Z	slowz3r	ubunjusty	nvm i found the gnome front
2006-11-27T12:01:00.000Z	ubunjusty	slowz3r	Ok.  If your using Gnome then I would suggest Network Manager.  It allows support to WPA and WEP enabled networks.  Or if you really wanted to you could learn how to do it via the command line.
2006-11-27T12:02:00.000Z	slowz3r	ubunjusty	ok i sintalled it with synaptic..but how do i open it up or were is it
2006-11-27T12:04:00.000Z	ubunjusty	slowz3r	Um...  You should log out and log back into Gnome and it should appear.
2006-11-27T12:05:00.000Z	ubunjusty	slowz3r	It's a little bar meter icon that should appear in the notification area.
2006-11-27T12:06:00.000Z	slowz3r	ubunjusty	so log out an log back in?
2006-11-27T12:06:00.000Z	ubunjusty	slowz3r	Yeah.  It should appear.  Let me know if it doesn't
