2006-07-15T14:36:00.000Z	ajax4	need_help	Have you tried deleting them as root?
2006-07-15T14:36:00.000Z	ajax4	need_help	Hang on
2006-07-15T14:42:00.000Z	ajax4	need_help	yeah, its ~/.Trash
2006-07-15T14:42:00.000Z	ajax4	need_help	What are the two filenames in your wastebasket?
2006-07-15T14:43:00.000Z	need_help	ajax4	(folder) ttf-telgu-fonts and (file) fonts.cache-1 [they are copies not the originals in /usr/share/fonts] 
2006-07-15T14:43:00.000Z	ajax4	need_help	type this: cd ~/.Trash
2006-07-15T14:43:00.000Z	ajax4	need_help	then type: sudo rm *
2006-07-15T14:43:00.000Z	need_help	ajax4	the folder just disapeared when I tried to view its contents - said it dont exist (yay)
2006-07-15T14:44:00.000Z	ajax4	need_help	cd ~/.Trash to make sure
2006-07-15T14:44:00.000Z	need_help	ajax4	rm: cannot remove `*': No such file or directory
2006-07-15T14:46:00.000Z	need_help	ajax4	Well there is the . and .., but we all know what they are
2006-07-15T14:47:00.000Z	ajax4	need_help	If the .Trash directory is empty then your trash is empty. Is the icon changed now?
2006-07-15T14:47:00.000Z	need_help	ajax4	No still says theres something in it
2006-07-15T14:47:00.000Z	need_help	ajax4	fonts.cache-1
2006-07-15T14:48:00.000Z	need_help	ajax4	BUT - Couldn't display "/home/lee/.Trash/fonts.cache-1". when I try to open it
2006-07-15T14:48:00.000Z	ajax4	need_help	Its possible that your trash is actually empty but the icon hasn't reflected the changes.
2006-07-15T14:48:00.000Z	ajax4	need_help	Yeah you could try that.
