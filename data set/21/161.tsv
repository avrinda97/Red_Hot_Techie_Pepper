2012-07-17T03:03:00.000Z	Wug		use a binary search lol
2012-07-17T03:03:00.000Z	Wug		anyway no solution so I'll ask again
2012-07-17T03:05:00.000Z	Wug		so fstab needs to be enfiddled
2012-07-17T03:06:00.000Z	Wug		I bought a new graphics card (radeon 7970) to replace old one (nvidia 9800gtx+), trying to activate the proprietary drivers, but the installation is failing and referring me to a logfile (/var/log/jockey.log) which just happens to not exist
2012-07-17T03:07:00.000Z	Wug		anyway, I've checked all of the retard stuff like file permissions and disk space
2012-07-17T03:08:00.000Z	Wug		I've concluded that it's not me being retarded
2012-07-17T03:09:00.000Z	Wug		here I am going through all these extra hoops
2012-07-17T03:09:00.000Z	Wug		boot and login to a tty
2012-07-17T03:09:00.000Z	Wug		i've heard that if I were to say "installing 7970 drivers on ubuntu is impossible because such and such a biased anti ubuntu reason" I would immediately get 500 helpful comments
2012-07-17T03:10:00.000Z	Wug		and then be kickbanned
2012-07-17T03:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Wug	People here are trying to be helpful. If they know how to fix the problem you're having they will probably reply to your question. Being inpolite / trolling will just convince people who might otherwise help you to instead ignore you
2012-07-17T03:13:00.000Z	Wug	Jordan_U	its a joke
2012-07-17T03:15:00.000Z	Wug	Jordan_U	the joke is that the easiest way to get help with ubuntu (or any other linux distro) is to say $DISTRO sucks because I can't X
2012-07-19T07:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Wug	SecretFire: No, that's not enough. Re-install.
2012-07-19T07:17:00.000Z	Wug	Jordan_U	if all he did was change the owner, then all he should have to do is reset the owner
2012-07-19T07:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Wug	If they changed the owner of *all files in /* to root, how do you change them back to their proper values?
2012-07-19T07:20:00.000Z	Wug	Jordan_U	I'll assume you mean to 1000 instead of to root
2012-07-19T07:21:00.000Z	Wug	Jordan_U	that being said, the only thing there thats supposed to be owned by users are their own home folders
2012-07-19T07:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Wug	Yes.
2012-10-22T10:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Wug	Due to security concerns setuid on directories has been ignored by most (all?) *NIX systems for a long time, I'm not sure GNU/Linux ever honored setuid on directories.
2012-10-22T10:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Wug	What is your end goal?
