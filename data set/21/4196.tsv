2008-07-01T20:45:00.000Z	Xavura		sudo?
2008-07-01T20:45:00.000Z	Xavura		I always have to type sudo in front of stuff to get it to work
2008-07-01T20:46:00.000Z	Xavura		Err, thanks for telling me that which I already know gordonjcp.
2008-07-01T20:46:00.000Z	Xavura		Pay attention :P
2008-07-01T20:47:00.000Z	soundray	Xavura	be careful how you talk to people who offer to help you
2008-07-01T20:47:00.000Z	Xavura	soundray	I'm not talking to anyone like anything, he was trying to help me with something that I didn't ask for help with, I was trying to help someone else, so err
2008-07-01T20:51:00.000Z	Xavura	soundray	? I am.
2008-07-01T20:51:00.000Z	soundray	Xavura	not consistently enough
2008-07-01T20:51:00.000Z	Xavura	soundray	I can't help if I forget every now and again, sorry
2008-07-01T20:52:00.000Z	soundray	Xavura	then don't say that you are if you really aren't
2008-07-03T04:09:00.000Z	soundray	Xavura	you manage to ask your questions here in a way that annoys, rather than attracting help
2008-07-03T04:10:00.000Z	soundray	Xavura	yes, it is. Still, I find that other people find ways to ask their questions more effectively.
2008-07-03T04:11:00.000Z	Xavura	soundray	Maybe I am not so good with words.
2008-07-03T04:17:00.000Z	soundray	Xavura	no, it isn't
2008-07-03T04:19:00.000Z	soundray	Xavura	see, this is what I meant above. The way you lecture people who are only trying to help (your response to Alps)
2008-07-03T04:21:00.000Z	soundray	Xavura	again, your wording is alienating
2008-07-03T04:22:00.000Z	Xavura	soundray	Wording of any paragraph in particular?
2008-07-03T04:22:00.000Z	soundray	Xavura	the whole response that was seemingly (though not explicitly) directed at me.
2008-07-03T04:33:00.000Z	soundray	Xavura	yes, it's a filesystem
2008-08-04T21:47:00.000Z	soundray	Xavura	please don't feed the trol
2008-08-04T21:47:00.000Z	Xavura	soundray	?
