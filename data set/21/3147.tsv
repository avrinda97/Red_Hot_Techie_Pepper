2009-07-11T17:30:00.000Z	iceroot		how to use a different xorf.conf for a specific user?
2009-07-11T17:31:00.000Z	MindVirus	iceroot	that's not what you want to do.
2009-07-11T17:31:00.000Z	iceroot	MindVirus	of course i want to do this
2009-07-11T17:31:00.000Z	MindVirus	iceroot	you want an effect achieved through different means.
2009-07-11T17:31:00.000Z	iceroot	MindVirus	for my games-account i dont want dual-view because wine is not able to handle dual-view
2009-07-11T17:33:00.000Z	MindVirus	iceroot	it's more than user-specific.
2009-07-11T17:33:00.000Z	MindVirus	iceroot	it's server-instance-specific.
2009-07-11T17:33:00.000Z	iceroot	MindVirus	ok, thx
2009-07-11T17:45:00.000Z	iceroot	MindVirus	xrandr --output DVI-1 --off  is doing nothing, as all other xrandr commands. only the nvidia-settings is working (which is using xorg.conf)
2010-01-04T06:14:00.000Z	iceroot	MindVirus	you can just rollback to that what is current in the repo
2010-01-04T06:14:00.000Z	MindVirus	iceroot	how?
2010-01-04T06:14:00.000Z	iceroot	MindVirus	sudo apt-get install packagename
2010-01-04T06:14:00.000Z	MindVirus	iceroot	Problem is, I don't know what was updated.
2010-01-04T06:15:00.000Z	iceroot	MindVirus	updates using ubuntu-repo? then you cant rollback
2010-02-14T23:28:00.000Z	iceroot	MindVirus	sudo apt-get remove --purge pulseaudio   should not kill ubuntu-desktop
2010-02-14T23:29:00.000Z	MindVirus	iceroot	It will REMOVE ubuntu-desktop.
2010-02-14T23:29:00.000Z	iceroot	MindVirus	that is a metapackage
2010-02-14T23:29:00.000Z	MindVirus	iceroot	Which depends on other packages.
2010-02-14T23:29:00.000Z	iceroot	MindVirus	its not removing gnome or other stuff
2010-02-14T23:29:00.000Z	MindVirus	iceroot	I know.
2010-02-14T23:30:00.000Z	iceroot	MindVirus	why not installing alsa, oss and alsa-oss and use that by default?
