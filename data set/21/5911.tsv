2008-02-11T04:28:00.000Z	screenname92834		so if anyone wanted to impersonate a repo, it couldn't impersonate the Release file, and if it was going to impersonate packages, it would, at least, have to maintain the checksum. Which I imagine is possible although tricky
2008-02-11T04:28:00.000Z	screenname92834		yeah I need to go to bed as well
2008-02-11T04:29:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	screenname92834	If your concern is safety.. it has been well thought out
2008-02-11T04:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	screenname92834	Not even close to an informed opinion
2008-02-11T04:46:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	screenname92834	Let me see f I can find the article that explains it better
2008-02-11T04:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	screenname92834	http://librenix.com/?inode=21  is another good one.
2008-02-11T04:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	screenname92834	I suggest that if you wish to discuss it you jump over to #ubuntu-offtopic.. this is the support room
2008-02-27T23:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	screenname92834	look at this   http://xwinman.org/
2008-05-17T21:12:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	screenname92834	Please /join #ubuntu-offtopic for discussions..
2008-05-17T21:13:00.000Z	screenname92834	Jack_Sparrow	why?
2008-05-17T21:13:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	screenname92834	this is support, it is not for polls or discussions...
2008-05-17T21:13:00.000Z	screenname92834	Jack_Sparrow	I am getting support. I am discovering information about Hardy.
2008-05-17T21:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	screenname92834	Not the same thing
2008-05-17T21:42:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	screenname92834	http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/
2008-05-17T21:43:00.000Z	screenname92834	Jack_Sparrow	thank you my good fellow.
2008-05-17T21:51:00.000Z	screenname92834	Jack_Sparrow	I think that website lists all ubuntu-compatible software, as it lists items that are not on my ubuntu system.
2008-05-17T21:52:00.000Z	screenname92834	Jack_Sparrow	so the question is this: what is considered ESSENTIAL ubuntu, who makes that decision, and where is the list?
2008-05-17T21:52:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	screenname92834	they may be in uyniverse or multivers or backports or proposed etc..  but all are in our repos
2008-05-17T21:53:00.000Z	screenname92834	Jack_Sparrow	they may be in the repos, and that tells me that they can run on ubuntu. However, when I install ubuntu, I don't get those packages.
2008-05-17T21:53:00.000Z	screenname92834	Jack_Sparrow	So who makes the ubuntu installation, and what goes on it?
2008-05-17T21:54:00.000Z	screenname92834	Jack_Sparrow	this is on-topic]
