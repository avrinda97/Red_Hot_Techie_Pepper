2009-11-25T08:09:00.000Z	resno_		what should i do when i get the message "no installation canidate"
2009-11-25T08:10:00.000Z	ChogyDan	resno_	pick a different package to install?  But that probably doesn't answer your question
2009-11-25T08:10:00.000Z	resno_	ChogyDan	nope not in the least
2009-11-25T08:11:00.000Z	resno_	ChogyDan	i tried installing the package, but it says its already installed. so im ant sure how to make it work
2009-11-25T08:12:00.000Z	ChogyDan	resno_	you will have to tell us the package to get any further help.  I mean, plain and simple, the package isn't there.  Either the repo is connected or the package is old
2009-11-25T08:12:00.000Z	resno_	ChogyDan	so how do i do that?
2009-11-25T08:13:00.000Z	ChogyDan	resno_	what package?
2009-11-25T08:13:00.000Z	resno_	ChogyDan	i am trying to linstall libcupsys2
2009-11-25T08:14:00.000Z	ChogyDan	resno_	libcups2
2009-11-25T08:14:00.000Z	resno_	ChogyDan	did that. thats where the problem starts
2009-11-25T08:15:00.000Z	ChogyDan	resno_	whats the problem?
2009-11-25T08:22:00.000Z	resno_	ChogyDan	  Package libcupsys2 is not installed. then i try to install libcupsys2 and it says i need to install libcups2.
2009-11-25T08:23:00.000Z	ChogyDan	resno_	yes, all you should need is libcups2     that will provide libcupsys2
2009-11-25T08:23:00.000Z	resno_	ChogyDan	my computer seems to think its not there
2009-11-25T08:23:00.000Z	ChogyDan	resno_	see: apt-cache show libcups2

2009-11-25T08:28:00.000Z	ChogyDan	resno_	hah!  I was giving you that command for your information.  I'm afraid I don't see what the problem is.  Don't you already have that installed?  What's going on?
2009-11-25T08:29:00.000Z	resno_	ChogyDan	i am following this guide. http://www.nervous.it/2009/04/canon-pixma-mp620-wireless-on-ubuntu/ and installing the deb packages. during the "install" it says it needs libcipsys2. and i cant find a way to get it there
