If nothing responds, press ctrl+alt+f2 and login (you'll be in a terminal session). From there run sudo ps ax|grep whateverwasrunning to find the process ID. Then sudo kill x, where x is the process ID you're trying ot kill.
2011-10-20T07:49:00.000Z	jeremy-77	Tohuw	 cool that is what I needed to know. thanks
2011-10-20T07:51:00.000Z	jeremy-77	Tohuw	 my WOW game froze and I tried to alt tab but couldn't get out. the mouse would change but could not get back to main desktop. finally hit the sleep button on keyboard and woke pc back and then was able to kill wow.
2011-10-20T07:52:00.000Z	Tohuw	jeremy-77	It seems a number of people have had odd problems with WoW in Linux. I have seen a few people suggest disabling all power saving or going so far as to remove ACPI from the kernel at start, which seems an unworthy trade-off for a game in my mind.
2011-10-20T07:54:00.000Z	jeremy-77	Tohuw	 i have not had many problems with wow in 10.04 but 11.04 and 11.10 are super buggy and had many problems so I will stick with stable 10.04
2011-10-20T07:55:00.000Z	Tohuw	jeremy-77	Sorry to hear you are having issues with stability in regards to WoW. I have found the core, supported aspects of both versions (10.10-11.10) to be quite stable overall.
2011-10-20T07:56:00.000Z	jeremy-77	Tohuw	 maybe its my hardware ?
2011-10-20T07:57:00.000Z	Tohuw	jeremy-77	Perhaps. If you're using ATI, their proprietary driver seems to have worsened for many people.
2011-10-20T07:59:00.000Z	jeremy-77	Tohuw	 im running radeon hd 2600xt with 11.9 catalyst
2011-10-20T08:00:00.000Z	jeremy-77	Tohuw	 I am getting 30 to 50 fps in uncrowded areas and 19 to 20 in crowded places or cities
2011-10-20T08:01:00.000Z	Tohuw	jeremy-77	how did you install catalyst?
2011-10-20T08:01:00.000Z	jeremy-77	Tohuw	from ati website and just ran it
2011-10-20T08:01:00.000Z	Tohuw	jeremy-77	completely remove that and run hardware drivers. Try the version it suggests.
2011-10-20T08:02:00.000Z	jeremy-77	Tohuw	I ran a program called mangler when wow froze this time
2011-10-20T08:02:00.000Z	jeremy-77	Tohuw	 I will try that and see
2011-10-20T08:02:00.000Z	Tohuw	jeremy-77	interesting, I just apt-cache searched mangler. I did not know that existed. Thank you.
2011-10-20T08:03:00.000Z	jeremy-77	Tohuw	I love it. it works great as a native linux vent
2011-10-20T08:09:00.000Z	jeremy-77	Tohuw	can I use the ati installer to remove it or should i use terminal ?  and if I use teminal what is the apt-get remove ?
2011-10-20T08:10:00.000Z	Tohuw	jeremy-77	Remove it from software center. Search ATI and remove stuff that's installed. Be prepared for possible badthings. ActionParsnip, do you remember the ubottu trigger for fixing X after your config/3rd party drivers have been borked?
2011-10-20T08:14:00.000Z	jeremy-77	Tohuw	the ati catalyst is not showing in the software center in installed software
2011-10-20T08:14:00.000Z	Tohuw	jeremy-77	dpkg --get-selections|grep -i cata
