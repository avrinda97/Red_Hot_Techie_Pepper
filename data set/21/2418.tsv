2009-10-26T17:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hylman	 i found moblin.. lacking. :)
2009-10-26T17:26:00.000Z	hylman	Dr_Willis	lacking?
2009-10-26T17:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hylman	 i found it totally unuseable.. :) i was being nice...
2009-10-26T17:28:00.000Z	hylman	Dr_Willis	I think moblin is enough for "general" user of netbook, i.e.: browsing n social
2009-10-26T17:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hylman	 i couldent get half the stuff to work.. but it is a work in progress and that was 3 weeks+ ago
2009-10-26T17:31:00.000Z	hylman	Dr_Willis	in my case, most of the features I need are working well in moblin...
2009-12-01T17:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hylman	 theres a few in here that use it.
2009-12-01T17:54:00.000Z	hylman	Dr_Willis	do you use it?
2009-12-01T17:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hylman	 ive used it in the past. poerhaps ask your actual question about it . and someone may answer you
2010-02-21T18:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hylman	 its a work in progress
2010-02-21T18:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hylman	 i got it on my netbook.

2010-02-21T18:41:00.000Z	hylman	Dr_Willis	how's the boot time anyway?
2010-02-21T18:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hylman	 under 30 sec
2010-02-21T18:42:00.000Z	hylman	Dr_Willis	is that from pushing the power button to wifi ready?
2010-02-21T18:44:00.000Z	hylman	Dr_Willis	atm, I'm getting 57 sec from hitting the power button to wifi ready. This is with netbook 9.10 on eeepc (hdd)
2010-02-21T18:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hylman	 well wifi is ready as soon as i get to the desktop.  I could set up gdm to auto login i guess and time it.. but onceya get under 45 sec.. does it really matter much :)
2010-02-21T18:47:00.000Z	hylman	Dr_Willis	same here. wifi ready as soon as I get to the desktop, and that is 57 sec... that's with 2sec delay of grub
