2010-06-11T20:53:00.000Z	kreppnar	ikhider	did you have an update last night?
2010-06-11T20:54:00.000Z	ikhider	kreppnar	no
2010-06-11T20:54:00.000Z	kreppnar	ikhider	how long have you had it installed?
2010-06-11T20:55:00.000Z	ikhider	kreppnar	Several months
2010-06-11T20:56:00.000Z	kreppnar	ikhider	but normally a computer would tell you "no operating system found" if it didn't have one at all
2010-06-11T20:56:00.000Z	ikhider	kreppnar	All I get is a winking cursor, nothing else
2010-06-11T20:56:00.000Z	ikhider	kreppnar	I went off for a while and came back, same winking cursor
2010-06-11T20:57:00.000Z	kreppnar	ikhider	you dont have any  external devices or any cd in the drive that its trying to boot from do you?
2010-06-11T20:57:00.000Z	ikhider	kreppnar	no
2010-06-11T20:58:00.000Z	kreppnar	ikhider	have you tried booting a live ubuntu disk?
2010-06-11T20:59:00.000Z	ikhider	kreppnar	No
2010-06-11T20:59:00.000Z	ikhider	kreppnar	So you think it is a grub issue? Because I never did get a grub menu
2010-06-11T20:59:00.000Z	kreppnar	ikhider	possible
2010-06-11T20:59:00.000Z	kreppnar	ikhider	or has your harddrive failed you?
2010-06-11T21:00:00.000Z	ikhider	kreppnar	No, my hard drive did not fail me
2010-06-11T21:01:00.000Z	kreppnar	ikhider	maybe you can boot a live cd..and if you have a thumb drive, make a start up disk?
2010-06-11T21:01:00.000Z	kreppnar	ikhider	to see if you can get it to boot your linux
2010-06-11T21:03:00.000Z	ikhider	kreppnar	Okay, I will download a live disc, thanks!
2010-06-11T21:03:00.000Z	kreppnar	ikhider	yeah they should have a boot disk creating option on the live cd
2010-06-11T21:04:00.000Z	kreppnar	ikhider	that should possibly kick start grub, and possibly detect your old linux install
