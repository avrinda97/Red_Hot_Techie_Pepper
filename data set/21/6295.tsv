2008-11-02T03:37:00.000Z	Logikos		ok, i read that, i did use the add/remove and tryed installing sun-java6-bin like that website said but it had dependancies ... what do i do about that?
2008-11-02T03:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	Logikos	dependencies are automatically installed by synaptic/apt
2008-11-02T03:39:00.000Z	erUSUL	Logikos	maybe you need to add multiverse? go to System>Admin>Software Sources and check multiverse and universe in the first tab
2008-11-02T03:40:00.000Z	Logikos	erUSUL	all of the checkboxes in system>admin>software sources first tab are checked
2008-11-02T03:40:00.000Z	Logikos		other ideas?
2008-11-02T03:40:00.000Z	Logikos		i dont even know where to go to see what dependancies i need?
2008-11-02T03:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	Logikos	please paste the exact error you get when you try to install sun-java6-bin

2008-11-02T03:42:00.000Z	Logikos	erUSUL	the error came, and is now gone ... i dont know how to recall it ... it did at the end say that it was installed sucessfuly ... but the update thing said there was dependancies, i updated and then that thing said that it was 'broken' dependancies ... i did apt-get check but it only gave me 3 lines ... it checked, built a list, then did something else ... then left me with a prompt, gave me no info really
2008-11-02T03:42:00.000Z	Logikos	erUSUL	so i dont have the ability to copy the error anymore, should i remove it and try again?
