2007-07-06T15:55:00.000Z	dave__		Hello all
2007-07-06T15:56:00.000Z	dave__		hey petervk
2007-07-06T15:56:00.000Z	dave__		Have you guys used Ktorrent before?
2007-07-06T15:57:00.000Z	MajorPayne	dave__	I use it all the time, not much of an expert in it, but what's the problem?
2007-07-06T15:58:00.000Z	dave__	MajorPayne	I think I might have encountered a problem with it, my comp gets all slow when I open it.
2007-07-06T15:59:00.000Z	MajorPayne	dave__	Ahh.  I woudldn't know about that.
2007-07-06T16:00:00.000Z	dave__	MajorPayne	What's the shortcut to kill a window here in ubuntu?
2007-07-06T16:00:00.000Z	MajorPayne	dave__	I use xkill.
2007-07-07T16:01:00.000Z	dave__	MajorPayne	but what's a keyboard combination for it?
2007-07-07T16:01:00.000Z	MajorPayne	dave__	I think you can set up a shortcut for xkill.  But for now just open a terminal, type xkill and click on the window.
2007-07-07T16:01:00.000Z	MajorPayne	dave__	I don't think there is one.
2007-07-07T16:02:00.000Z	dave__	MajorPayne	is there like a crtl+alt+del in ubuntu?
2007-07-07T16:02:00.000Z	MajorPayne	dave__	Worst case you can restart the X server with Ctrl+Alt+backspace but don't do that unless you really have to.
2007-07-07T16:03:00.000Z	MajorPayne	dave__	Not that I know of.  No need, just try xkill.  That will do basicly everything.
2007-07-07T16:03:00.000Z	MajorPayne	dave__	You have to remember that Ubuntu is not Windows.
2007-07-07T16:03:00.000Z	dave__	MajorPayne	cos my cursor gets all slow, it wont let me do anything. I've been in this situation for a couple times now, and I have had to reboot
2007-07-07T16:04:00.000Z	dave__	MajorPayne	I know it's not Window$ but I used PCLinuxOS before and pressing crtl+alt+esc did it for me
2007-07-07T16:04:00.000Z	MajorPayne	dave__	Ahh.  I never used that distro before.  Every one is a bit different.
2007-07-07T16:05:00.000Z	dave__	MajorPayne	I know that, but I was hoping one would know... Is there a shortcut for the terminal then?
2007-07-07T16:06:00.000Z	MajorPayne	dave__	Applications, Accessories, Terminal.
2007-07-07T16:06:00.000Z	dave__	MajorPayne	thanks man, another Q. I just got my cd for 7.04, how do I upgrade?
