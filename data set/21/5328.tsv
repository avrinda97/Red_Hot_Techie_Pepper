2007-11-07T23:53:00.000Z	Pici	mediabuntu	you enabled root's password?
2007-11-07T23:56:00.000Z	mediabuntu	Pici	i edited ssh_config and set it to permit root logon
2007-11-07T23:56:00.000Z	Pici	mediabuntu	And you unlocked the root account?
2007-11-07T23:56:00.000Z	Pici	mediabuntu	I strongly suggest not doing that.
2007-11-07T23:57:00.000Z	mediabuntu	Pici	i really need two
2007-11-07T23:57:00.000Z	Pici	mediabuntu	What are you looking for it to do? not ask for the password at all?
2007-11-07T23:59:00.000Z	mediabuntu	Pici	im using backuppc. it needs to log on and run a buckup.
2007-11-07T23:59:00.000Z	Pici	mediabuntu	why are you running sudo before ssh?
2007-11-08T00:01:00.000Z	mediabuntu	Pici	i need to to work with out asking for a password, ssh -l root 192.168.1.7 whoami
2007-11-08T00:01:00.000Z	Pici	mediabuntu	And without using keyfiles?
2007-11-08T00:04:00.000Z	mediabuntu	Pici	yep i have exchanged the keys. i done as instructed here. http://backuppc.sourceforge.net/faq/ssh.html
2007-11-08T00:06:00.000Z	Pici	mediabuntu	Does it prompt you for a password if you just use `ssh root@address` and not `sudo ssh root@address`
2007-11-08T00:09:00.000Z	mediabuntu	Pici	it stikk wants a password root@192.168.1.7's password:
2007-11-08T00:09:00.000Z	Pici	mediabuntu	And if you enter root's password?
2007-11-08T00:09:00.000Z	Pici	mediabuntu	does it work?
2007-11-08T00:19:00.000Z	Pici	mediabuntu	log on as a normal user
2007-11-08T00:38:00.000Z	Pici	mediabuntu	the last manpage suggests to `touch /var/log/wtmp` if you get that error
2007-11-08T04:33:00.000Z	Pici	mediabuntu	hi.
2007-11-08T04:37:00.000Z	Pici	mediabuntu	I dont have the time to do in-depth stuff right now.
