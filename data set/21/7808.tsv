2006-07-14T06:50:00.000Z	jrib	abhinay	you should :)

2006-07-25T08:03:00.000Z	jrib	abhinay	sudo dpkg-reconfigure kdm
2006-07-25T08:11:00.000Z	jrib	abhinay	check ownership of ~/.{ICE,X}authority
2006-07-25T08:13:00.000Z	jrib	abhinay	were those files owned by your user?
2006-07-25T08:15:00.000Z	abhinay	jrib	where can i find   " ~/.{ICE,X}authority  "  ?
2006-07-25T08:16:00.000Z	jrib	abhinay	~/.{ICE,X}authority means /home/USERNAME/.Xauthority and /home/USERNAME/.ICEauthority
2006-07-25T08:17:00.000Z	abhinay	jrib	-rw------- 1 root root 126 2006-07-25 16:09 .Xauthority
2006-07-25T08:17:00.000Z	jrib	abhinay	delete them
2006-07-25T08:18:00.000Z	jrib	abhinay	yes, you can rename them if you prefer, or chown them to your user, deleting is easier
2006-07-25T08:19:00.000Z	jrib	abhinay	yeah, they'll get created again when you login
2006-07-25T08:19:00.000Z	abhinay	jrib	ok
2006-07-25T08:26:00.000Z	abhinay	jrib	same problem , nothing has changed ... :\
2006-07-25T08:27:00.000Z	jrib	abhinay	hmm can you check that you have free space available?
2006-07-25T08:28:00.000Z	abhinay	jrib	27 % free , available
2006-07-25T08:28:00.000Z	jrib	abhinay	don't know then, deleting those two files usually does it, you must be having a different issue
2006-07-25T08:29:00.000Z	abhinay	jrib	i recently updated my system to edgy eft
2006-07-25T08:29:00.000Z	jrib	abhinay	#ubuntu+1 is for edgy, and it's a development version so it may be broken now
