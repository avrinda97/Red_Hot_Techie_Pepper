2008-04-23T02:39:00.000Z	SidToner		i'm trying to install a new video card with 8.04 installed tried reconfiguring xorg by using sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg; and it doesn't work right... any ideas?
2008-04-23T02:40:00.000Z	SidToner		ok
2008-04-23T02:40:00.000Z	SidToner		let me try this another way... how would you reccomend installing a new video card?
2008-04-23T02:41:00.000Z	SidToner		i hate you all
2008-04-23T02:42:00.000Z	BoemLauw	SidToner	Cool :)
2008-04-23T02:43:00.000Z	SidToner	BoemLauw	just trying to get what should be a simple question answered... or at least someone say that they haven't a clue
2008-04-23T02:43:00.000Z	BoemLauw	SidToner	i'm sorry, must have overlooked it. Can you ask it again. (I ain't browsing this chan)
2008-04-23T02:44:00.000Z	BoemLauw	SidToner	What type of video card are we talking about ?
2008-04-23T02:45:00.000Z	SidToner	BoemLauw	radeon 9550 not a great card but i'm getting about 100% cpu usage just displaying a window... it was a 9200
2008-04-23T02:45:00.000Z	BoemLauw	SidToner	ai... Me not ati owning. However, why don't you download the driver/installer from ati ?
2008-04-23T02:46:00.000Z	SidToner	BoemLauw	usually the one installed automatically works best... at least for me in the past... that's why iwas trying to just do the auto reconfigure
2008-04-23T02:47:00.000Z	BoemLauw	SidToner	that isn't true. It works, but thats all it does. No accel. Your eye candy comes are a price.
2008-04-23T02:48:00.000Z	SidToner	BoemLauw	no eye candy needed... nothing fancy ... trying to get this to work as a media center pc... playing movie files mostly... but i will give that a try... thanks
2008-04-23T02:49:00.000Z	SidToner	BoemLauw	i am going to try the regular driver... thanks again
2008-04-23T02:49:00.000Z	SidToner	BoemLauw	the one you reccomended that is
2008-04-23T02:50:00.000Z	BoemLauw	SidToner	I'll look it up for you. Hang tight
2008-04-23T02:50:00.000Z	SidToner	BoemLauw	no prob i'll just use the restricted driver installer :)
2008-04-23T02:51:00.000Z	SidToner	BoemLauw	that's not same driver? oh damn
2008-04-23T02:51:00.000Z	BoemLauw	SidToner	no, it's ATI's
2008-04-23T02:52:00.000Z	SidToner	BoemLauw	getting the ati one now
2008-04-23T02:53:00.000Z	SidToner	BoemLauw	lol thanks... it's an older card but i hope it will do
