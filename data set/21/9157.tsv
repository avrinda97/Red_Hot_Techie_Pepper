2006-11-03T09:33:00.000Z	zerokarmaleft		3rd install attempt with alternate iso
2006-11-03T09:34:00.000Z	zerokarmaleft		it keeps locking up when dpkg is configuing all the packages
2006-11-03T09:34:00.000Z	zerokarmaleft		i can't even switch over to tty2
2006-11-03T09:36:00.000Z	zerokarmaleft		ubuntu itself is all the antispyware youll ever need
2006-11-03T09:38:00.000Z	zerokarmaleft		anyone know how to get more detailed info on the "select and install software" step of the alternate install iso?
2006-11-03T09:39:00.000Z	LjL	zerokarmaleft	that's probably "dselect". google for that
2006-11-03T09:40:00.000Z	LjL	zerokarmaleft	yes i think it's still dselect
2006-11-03T09:41:00.000Z	zerokarmaleft	LjL	nope it's just stuck
2006-11-03T09:41:00.000Z	LjL	zerokarmaleft	i'm not saying you should *run* dselect. i'm simply saying that i think the "select and install software" step is using dselect
2006-11-03T09:42:00.000Z	zerokarmaleft	LjL	i think it's equivalent to dpkg --configure -a
2006-11-03T09:43:00.000Z	zerokarmaleft	LjL	LiveCD hardlocks on  me launching X
2006-11-03T09:43:00.000Z	LjL	zerokarmaleft	tried safe graphics mode?
2006-11-03T09:44:00.000Z	zerokarmaleft	LjL	hmm, not yet
2006-11-03T09:44:00.000Z	zerokarmaleft	LjL	actually more comfortable with the alt install iso so i've been trying to get through that.  worked fine on my laptop though
2006-11-03T09:44:00.000Z	LjL	zerokarmaleft	have you verified the burn?
2006-11-03T09:47:00.000Z	zerokarmaleft	LjL	this network connection is spotty though sometimes, i wonder if a network timeout makes it choke
2006-11-03T09:48:00.000Z	LjL	zerokarmaleft	i think it might...
2006-11-03T09:49:00.000Z	zerokarmaleft	LjL	i wish there was some way i could tell for sure before filing a bug
2006-11-03T09:49:00.000Z	zerokarmaleft	LjL	ideally, it should bail out with an error and let me retry the step
2006-11-03T09:50:00.000Z	LjL	zerokarmaleft	that's what it usually does. anyway, you should be able to get to a console with alt+Fx, and try looking at /var/log...
2006-11-03T10:22:00.000Z	zerokarmaleft	LjL	hmm, install seems to have completed this time...rebooting...
