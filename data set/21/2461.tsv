2009-10-05T03:06:00.000Z	dsfagreg		What's the best mind-mapping tool?
2009-10-05T03:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dsfagreg	I think there is something out there for mindmapping that is good  and opensource for Linux, but in that case I don't remember the name
2009-10-05T03:08:00.000Z	dsfagreg	sebsebseb	you seem to be the smarter one. Do you know about a mindmapping tool for ubuntu?
2009-10-05T03:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dsfagreg	no and I dont' think there is anything in the repo, but  you might be able to find one if you search sites such as  http://www.sf.net and http://www.freshmeat.net or even Google
2009-10-05T03:10:00.000Z	dsfagreg	sebsebseb	there's nothing in the repo? Last time I checked there were more than 27000 packages.
2009-10-05T03:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dsfagreg	I meant nothing in the repo probably for mind mapping
2009-10-05T03:11:00.000Z	dsfagreg	sebsebseb	That's a very poor assumption.
2009-10-05T03:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dsfagreg	Not every Linux programs in the repo
2009-10-05T03:12:00.000Z	dsfagreg	sebsebseb	There's 27000 packages. Come on, I'm not talking about "every linux program", just ANY mindmapping tool.
2009-10-05T03:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dsfagreg	Cario Dock being an example of a program that isn't in the repo,  only saying since  PCTeacher012  just now
2009-10-05T03:12:00.000Z	dsfagreg	sebsebseb	thanks for trying though.
2009-10-05T03:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dsfagreg	you can search synaptic
2009-10-05T03:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dsfagreg	add/remove is basic   synaptic package manager is more advanced
2009-10-05T03:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dsfagreg	you probably won't be able to find one though
2009-10-05T03:13:00.000Z	dsfagreg	sebsebseb	just did, and found 6 mindmapping tools. Yeah right, I didn't find *one*.
2009-10-05T03:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dsfagreg	oh well  I had this feeling there wasn't anything,  looks like I was wrong, and in that case that stuff got added recently
2009-10-05T03:13:00.000Z	dsfagreg	sebsebseb	Stop being pessimistic.
2009-10-05T03:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dsfagreg	or  sometimes good answers aren't  available just like that, but people still tried to help you
2009-10-05T03:15:00.000Z	dsfagreg	sebsebseb	I understand you're a volunteer, and thanks for doing that. I'm just being reasonable.
2009-10-05T03:17:00.000Z	dsfagreg	sebsebseb	nothing personal. Catch ya later.
2009-10-05T03:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dsfagreg	ok np I guess
