2008-06-30T08:36:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two		I understand about off topic, but this is related to compatibility with Ubuntu.
2008-06-30T08:36:00.000Z	bazhang	Seven_Six_Two	aye, but straying a bit too far :)
2008-06-30T08:37:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	bazhang	nickrud , I've had this talk before. We can agree to disagree and I'll drop the topic...
2008-07-16T22:41:00.000Z	bazhang	Seven_Six_Two	aptoncd
2008-07-16T22:41:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	bazhang	that's a package name?
2008-07-16T22:41:00.000Z	bazhang	Seven_Six_Two	see above
2008-07-16T22:42:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	bazhang	oh thanks. I missed that. I was thinking about using a caching proxy, but the cd would be easier I think
2008-12-07T08:44:00.000Z	bazhang	Seven_Six_Two	hijack?
2008-12-07T08:44:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	bazhang	sortof. it's mine and I have root, but I want to hijack a currently running x-session
2008-12-07T08:45:00.000Z	bazhang	Seven_Six_Two	no need ever to have 'root'
2008-12-07T08:45:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	bazhang	um, ok thanks.
2011-03-26T12:22:00.000Z	bazhang	Seven_Six_Two	sure it is, it s in the repos
2011-03-26T12:26:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	bazhang	I read the cloud page too fast! It says "Eucalyptus is the technology at the core of UEC â€“ and will be in Ubuntu 11.04"
2011-03-26T12:26:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	bazhang	"as it has been since 9.04"   oops!
2011-04-17T05:26:00.000Z	bazhang	Seven_Six_Two	yes
2011-04-17T05:46:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	bazhang	nice catch! I didn't know that was a requirement.
2011-04-17T05:46:00.000Z	bazhang	Seven_Six_Two	its a bug of long standing
2012-09-22T21:27:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	bazhang	I know that
2012-09-22T21:27:00.000Z	bazhang	Seven_Six_Two	this is ubuntu support
2012-09-22T21:27:00.000Z	bazhang	Seven_Six_Two	if you are distro shopping for something outside of ubuntu, then ##linux is a place to ask, not here
2012-11-13T11:10:00.000Z	bazhang	Seven_Six_Two	thats enough
