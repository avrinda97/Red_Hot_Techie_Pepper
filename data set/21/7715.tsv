2007-08-01T09:59:00.000Z	aboutblank		anyone know why I'd be getting a scratchy sound from my left speaker while music or other sounds are playing? I'm using an intel high definition onboard audio controller. It doesn't happen with other sound cards or on windows
2007-08-01T09:59:00.000Z	JeffATL	aboutblank	that sounds pretty bad - like a bugg driver
2007-08-01T09:59:00.000Z	JeffATL	aboutblank	oops, buggy
2007-08-01T10:00:00.000Z	aboutblank	JeffATL	I
2007-08-01T10:00:00.000Z	JeffATL	aboutblank	you?
2007-08-01T10:00:00.000Z	aboutblank	JeffATL	I've reinstalled all my sound stuff recently
2007-08-01T10:00:00.000Z	aboutblank	JeffATL	and it happened before that
2007-08-01T10:00:00.000Z	aboutblank	JeffATL	started up again recently =/
2007-08-01T10:01:00.000Z	JeffATL	aboutblank	buggy driver or worse, i'd guess
2007-08-01T10:01:00.000Z	aboutblank	JeffATL	not something I can fix without knowing something about programming sound drivers then?
2007-08-01T10:02:00.000Z	JeffATL	aboutblank	i assume that what you're hearing is digital hash, i.e., non-audio getting directed to the sound chip
2007-08-01T10:03:00.000Z	JeffATL	aboutblank	you might consider splicing in a vanilla kernel that you compile ourself
2007-08-01T10:03:00.000Z	JeffATL	aboutblank	yourself
2007-08-01T10:04:00.000Z	aboutblank	JeffATL	I am using a kernel I compiled myself. I also compiled my alsa stuff myself
2007-08-01T10:04:00.000Z	JeffATL	aboutblank	i'd review all that (esp gcc options) carefully
2007-08-01T10:05:00.000Z	aboutblank	JeffATL	alright
2007-08-01T10:05:00.000Z	aboutblank	JeffATL	I followed the alsa-project installation instructions for my card specifically though =/
2007-08-01T10:07:00.000Z	JeffATL	aboutblank	i don't know what more to tell you other than post a bug to alsa
2007-08-01T10:07:00.000Z	aboutblank	JeffATL	alright, thanks anyway
2007-08-01T10:08:00.000Z	JeffATL	aboutblank	you could also try another distro and see if it's a general linux problem
2007-08-01T10:08:00.000Z	aboutblank	JeffATL	hmm. I have a knoppix live cd. I can try that
