2011-11-21T22:47:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		you may not be able to write to that file as you are trying than
2011-11-21T22:47:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		well you can do tee -a
2011-11-21T22:47:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		echo something | sudo tee -a /proc/wherever/file
2011-11-21T22:48:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		or don't append rather...
2011-11-21T22:48:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		over write
2011-11-21T22:48:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		echo something | sudo tee /proc/wherever/file
2011-11-21T22:48:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		yes
2011-11-21T22:48:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		OR try the same echo command as root.. either or should work for you
2011-11-21T22:50:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		welcome
2011-11-21T22:50:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		is there a way to make mountd/nfs client reread fstab on the fly?
2011-11-21T22:51:00.000Z	zykotick9	SolarisBoy	"sudo mount -a" will remount everything in fstab
2011-11-21T22:51:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		yeps
2011-11-21T22:51:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		but it's not using the new updated options on my NFS shares =(
2011-11-21T22:51:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		i read a couple of articles referncing thats a buggy type behaviour or w/e
2011-11-21T22:52:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	zykotick9	so was wondering if any other tricks existed.. i updated fstab on 20+ hosts and i know it works fine if i unmount and mount,, but they are in prod and i dont want to do it like that if i dont have to..
2011-11-21T22:53:00.000Z	zykotick9	SolarisBoy	sorry don't have a solution for that... good luck.
2011-11-21T22:54:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	zykotick9	no worries
2011-11-21T22:54:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	zykotick9	thanks by the way
2011-11-21T22:56:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	zykotick9	i was questioning if this would work 'mount -i remount <share>'
2011-11-21T22:56:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	zykotick9	turns out it does
2011-11-21T22:56:00.000Z	zykotick9	SolarisBoy	nice
