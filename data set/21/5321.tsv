2007-11-05T21:33:00.000Z	julius		just means it will go grub->xp
2007-11-05T21:33:00.000Z	julius		jeffrey:yes
2007-11-05T21:33:00.000Z	julius		spamoon: what soundcard do you have
2007-11-05T21:34:00.000Z	julius		lspci | grep AC
2007-11-05T21:34:00.000Z	spamoom	julius	Creative Soundblaster Xfi Platinum
2007-11-05T21:35:00.000Z	spamoom	julius	hmm, I'm not too bothered about open source aslong as it works =/. Lack of sound is really bad
2007-11-05T21:38:00.000Z	spamoom	julius	Positive, I would have at least though they would do the 32-bit first as it is the most popular, but alas they didnt.
2007-11-05T21:38:00.000Z	spamoom	julius	Google has failed me this time
2007-11-05T21:39:00.000Z	spamoom	julius	sudo modprobe snd-sb16    I got that off the ubuntu site, but didnt do anything =/
2007-11-05T21:40:00.000Z	julius	spamoom	is that module for your card or for the older soundblaster's
2007-11-05T21:40:00.000Z	spamoom	julius	thats the thing, im not too sure
2007-11-05T21:41:00.000Z	spamoom	julius	after I have put in that command though, do I need to reboot?
2007-11-05T21:41:00.000Z	spamoom	julius	<-- bit of a linux noob
2007-11-05T21:41:00.000Z	julius	spamoom	no
2007-11-05T21:44:00.000Z	spamoom	julius	Actually now that I think about it, the sound worked on an older version of ubuntu I think. Could 7.10 have anything to do with it?
2007-11-05T21:45:00.000Z	julius	spamoom	find the name of the module used for your card then type dmesg | grep *modulename*
2007-11-05T21:46:00.000Z	julius	spamoom	that checks the log for any outputs from that module
2007-11-05T21:48:00.000Z	spamoom	julius	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/43424/
2007-11-05T21:48:00.000Z	spamoom	julius	only the sb gave me some output
2007-11-05T21:51:00.000Z	julius	spamoom	i havent had much experience with the cards myself, maybe make a post in the ubuntu forums, under hardware or whatever not in gen help or abs beginners
2007-11-05T21:52:00.000Z	spamoom	julius	thanks will do that. Cheers for you help
