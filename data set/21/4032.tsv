2011-07-01T23:34:00.000Z	stercor		I am _not_ trolling, or starting a flame war, but did Ubuntu choose LibreOffice over OpenOffice because OpenOffice´s status was in question at the time Ubuntu made the decision>
2011-07-01T23:35:00.000Z	szal	stercor	no, because like most other distros *buntu used Go-OO before, and LO is the logical continuation of Go-OO, only w/o the trademark
2011-07-01T23:37:00.000Z	stercor	szal	Thanks.
2011-07-01T23:39:00.000Z	stercor	szal	It´s a nice day, isn´t it?
2011-07-06T06:57:00.000Z	szal	stercor	what gfx card?
2011-07-06T06:57:00.000Z	stercor	szal	I don't know.
2011-07-06T06:57:00.000Z	szal	stercor	lspci | grep -i vga
2011-07-06T06:57:00.000Z	stercor	szal	Is there a way to find out?
2011-07-06T06:57:00.000Z	stercor	szal	Mental telepathy...
2011-07-06T06:59:00.000Z	stercor	szal	gohdan: GeForce 6150 noforce 40] rev 2
2011-07-06T07:00:00.000Z	szal	stercor	sudo apt-get install nvidia-current && sudo nvidia-xconfig <- then reboot
2011-07-06T07:00:00.000Z	stercor	szal	Oh, for cut-and-paste in the terminal window... :-~
2011-07-06T07:09:00.000Z	szal	stercor	how about you finish your nVidia driver installation? ;)
2011-07-06T07:11:00.000Z	stercor	szal	I've installed nvidia-current; it couldn't find the other package, but nvidia-current pulled in some packages that seem to be appropriate.
2011-07-06T07:11:00.000Z	stercor	szal	I guess it's reboot time...
2011-07-06T07:11:00.000Z	szal	stercor	what other pkg?  nvidia-xconfig is not a pkg, it's a command that comes w/ the nVidia driver
2011-07-06T07:12:00.000Z	stercor	szal	Oh, I misunderstood.  I'll do the nvidia-xconfig.  Thanks for the heads up.
2011-07-06T07:14:00.000Z	stercor	szal	the xorg.conf looks _MUCH_ better than the 2-line one I had before.
2011-07-06T07:15:00.000Z	stercor	szal	reboot time. BRB.
2011-07-06T07:42:00.000Z	stercor	szal	What was that nvidia command again?
