2011-06-18T18:00:00.000Z	AciD_		after some unexpected hard reset, I saw that some files from / are corrupted. So I decided to reainstall all the packages using "dpkg --get-selections | awk '$2 == "install" { print $1 }' | xargs apt-get -y --reinstall install". For unknown reason, nothing will install outputing this error "E: Impossible d'effectuer la configuration immédiate de « bash ». Veuillez consulter la page de manuel apt.conf(5) et notamment la section à
2011-06-18T18:00:00.000Z	AciD_		 propos de APT::Immediate-Configure, pour plus d'informations. (2)" which could be translated into "E: Could not perform immediate configuration "bash". Please see the manual page apt.conf (5) and in particular the section about APT:: Immediate-Configure, for more information. (2)". any idea how to force the system to reinstall all installed packages ?
2011-06-18T18:01:00.000Z	pksadiq	AciD_	do an fsck on the partition
2011-06-18T18:02:00.000Z	AciD_	pksadiq	all clean iirc
2011-06-18T18:03:00.000Z	AciD_	pksadiq	at least fsck says it's clean, but I somehow have some ext4 error in /var/log/kern.log from time to time
2011-06-18T18:04:00.000Z	pksadiq	AciD_	force fsck
2011-06-18T18:06:00.000Z	AciD_	pksadiq	errors like that : http://pastebin.com/8rHysFym
2011-06-18T18:07:00.000Z	AciD_	pksadiq	I'll reboot with a live usb to force the fsck. brb
2011-06-18T18:15:00.000Z	AciD_	pksadiq	everything seems fine even with the -f option
2011-06-18T18:16:00.000Z	AciD_	pksadiq	no error in the output, apart the information that 7,9% of my /home and 3,7% of my / files are not contiguous
2011-06-18T18:18:00.000Z	pksadiq	AciD_	k, try chrooting to your ubuntu and do dpkg --confgure -a
2011-06-18T18:19:00.000Z	AciD_	pksadiq	everything seems fine even with the -f option
2011-06-18T18:19:00.000Z	AciD_	pksadiq	no error in the output, apart the information that 7,9% of my /home and 3,7% of my / files are not contiguous
2011-06-18T18:24:00.000Z	AciD_	pksadiq	any though on my previous problem since fsck.ext4 returns no error whatsoever ?
2011-06-18T18:25:00.000Z	pksadiq	AciD_	so I hope there is no problem with your files due to restart, and also I hope now its working right, isn't it?
2011-06-18T18:26:00.000Z	AciD_	pksadiq	I still have so error in some files. For instance right now I'm copying all the files from / to a backup hd, and get some i/o error
2011-06-18T18:27:00.000Z	AciD_	pksadiq	the point is my previous problem was finding a way to force the reinstall of all deb packages using xargs and --get-selections
2011-06-18T18:27:00.000Z	AciD_	pksadiq	which wasn't working :/
2011-06-18T18:27:00.000Z	pksadiq	AciD_	so I think using dd is better to backup now
2011-06-18T18:29:00.000Z	AciD_	pksadiq	I'm not using dd since I want to be able to copy/paste the files to another partition if needed
