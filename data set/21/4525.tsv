2008-05-04T18:07:00.000Z	Saint`Dia	Carbonflux	Truthfully, how many girls you see in here.
2008-05-04T18:07:00.000Z	Carbonflux	Saint`Dia	well, they hide, so its hard to tell, ;)
2008-05-04T18:08:00.000Z	Saint`Dia	Carbonflux	My girl won't touch anything besides Vista.
2008-05-04T18:08:00.000Z	Carbonflux	Saint`Dia	Vista is fine, but it won't run on her laptop
2008-05-04T18:09:00.000Z	Saint`Dia	Carbonflux	I duel boot, for as much as I love Ubuntu, Windows runs everything, right, all the time. Hard to compete with that.
2008-05-04T18:11:00.000Z	Carbonflux	Saint`Dia	heh, well I think 8.04 can do what she needs which is mostly email and web, I do professional C++ dev so I sort of have to run it, I am happy with Vista now that I understand what they are doing but Ubuntu is getting really good, I have run it for a while for my "net" computer and OS dev, I think its ready for someone how just emails and web
2008-05-04T18:12:00.000Z	Saint`Dia	Carbonflux	Now, I will tell you, I started with ubuntu on dozens of comps, 8.04 is the first one where -everything- worked out of the box, I'm loving that.
2008-05-04T18:13:00.000Z	Saint`Dia	Carbonflux	Well, for me.
2008-05-04T18:13:00.000Z	Carbonflux	Saint`Dia	I just loaded it on this laptop, it detected everything, including the display :)
2008-05-04T18:14:00.000Z	Saint`Dia	Carbonflux	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkUTMm7elm4 <-- There's proof of how ubuntu runs on my laptop. Short vid.
2008-05-04T18:15:00.000Z	Carbonflux	Saint`Dia	what is your video card ?
2008-05-04T18:16:00.000Z	Carbonflux	Saint`Dia	heh, i love the devil girl btw ;)
2008-05-04T18:16:00.000Z	Saint`Dia	Carbonflux	Thank you, one sec on the vid card, lemme look.

2008-05-04T18:17:00.000Z	Carbonflux	Saint`Dia	wow thats good then
2008-05-04T18:17:00.000Z	Saint`Dia	Carbonflux	This laptop has seen alot of OS's. I've learned quite a bit, just from the problems.
2008-05-04T18:19:00.000Z	Carbonflux	Saint`Dia	the was a good demo, you make me feel better about what I am doing, just about ready to install now, liveCD only needed me to set my static ip's, otherwise its detected everything
2008-05-04T18:19:00.000Z	Saint`Dia	Carbonflux	The new Ubuntu is great, and has better laptop compatibility. I'm loving it. I have an Acer Aspire 5610Z laptop.
