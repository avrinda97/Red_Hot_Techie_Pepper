2012-05-28T19:13:00.000Z	odswct		how can i setup 3g usb modem to connect to internet in ubuntu server 12.04. can any one help me?
2012-05-28T19:13:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	odswct	Are there any Linux drivers for that specific modem?
2012-05-28T19:14:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	odswct	Could you post a pastebin of the output of the command 'lsusb'.
2012-05-28T19:16:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	odswct	Please use pastebin or paste.ubuntu.com. Do not post your output here.
2012-05-28T19:19:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	odswct	Go to pastebin.com, paste the output there, give it a life of an hour or so, and submit it and send teh link over here.
2012-05-28T19:20:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	odswct	There may be applications that can put things into pastebin but pastebin is a web service entirly different from Ubuntu like Google.
2012-05-28T19:22:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	odswct	It's easier just to copy paste it to pastebin.com. If you still want to learn how to install things from the terminal just ask.
2012-05-28T19:26:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	odswct	Use paste.ubuntu.com then
2012-05-28T19:28:00.000Z	odswct	DeltaHeavy	i just paste it to paste.ubuntu.com the lsusb output
2012-05-28T19:29:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	odswct	Bus 001 Device 003: ID 1c9e:9605 OMEGA TECHNOLOGY   <-- This is your modem?
2012-05-28T19:31:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	odswct	Try this: http://askubuntu.com/questions/126854/problem-connecting-internet-through-usb-modem-micromax
2012-05-28T19:34:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	odswct	The desktop and server versions are very similar. It more than probably applies to both.
2012-05-28T19:36:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	odswct	You'll have to do wtihout it and test your connection in other ways.
2012-05-28T19:37:00.000Z	odswct	DeltaHeavy	i'm new to linux. i don't know how to do that other way.
2012-05-28T19:38:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	odswct	Use 'ping apache.org' to test your connection.
2012-05-28T19:39:00.000Z	odswct	DeltaHeavy	how do i configure APN etc to connect to
2012-05-28T19:41:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	odswct	That depends on the software that came with it. I think your best bet is to look up how to configure that exact product with Ubuntu servers
2012-05-28T19:42:00.000Z	odswct	DeltaHeavy	there is no software available from vendor for linux. do u guide me the way?
2012-05-28T19:44:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	odswct	I don't know, I'm unsure about vendor specific stuff. I'd give you a push in the right direction but it would be against the rules.
2012-05-28T19:45:00.000Z	odswct	DeltaHeavy	thank you!
