2009-01-19T15:25:00.000Z	baz		has anyone noticed that it take firefox much longer to load if u type, for example "hello" in the address bar rather than "hello;"
2009-01-19T15:27:00.000Z	Slart	baz	still about the same speed.. and I end up at "Hello magazine" either way
2009-01-19T15:26:00.000Z	Slart	baz	it's about the same for me
2009-01-19T15:27:00.000Z	baz	Slart	i'm sorry i meant "hello\"
2009-01-19T15:27:00.000Z	Slart	baz	but I guess both ways goes to google.. perhaps googling for hello is faster than hello;
2009-01-19T15:27:00.000Z	baz	Slart	- the bottleneck isn't google, its firefox taking 10 SECONDS! to figure out that it is not a url...
2009-01-19T15:28:00.000Z	baz	Slart	oh really... maybe its a ubuntu problem then and i am not off topic!
2009-01-19T15:28:00.000Z	Slart	baz	it doesn't on my machine
2009-01-19T15:28:00.000Z	baz	Slart	are u by any chance on 64bit?
2009-01-19T15:28:00.000Z	Slart	baz	yup, 8.10 64 bit
2009-01-19T15:38:00.000Z	baz	Slart	definitely more
2009-12-28T23:00:00.000Z	Slart	baz	for most stuff, yes.. I think so
2010-02-22T15:40:00.000Z	Slart	baz	tried reinstalling the nfs server ?
2010-02-22T15:40:00.000Z	baz	Slart	The error occurs when I try to start/restart the service, yeah
2010-02-22T15:44:00.000Z	Slart	baz	can you pastebin the output of "file /usr/sbin/rpc.nfsd" ?
2010-02-22T15:45:00.000Z	baz	Slart	Interesting. It's 0 bytes :|
2010-02-22T15:46:00.000Z	Slart	baz	seems you've found the problem =)
2010-02-22T15:47:00.000Z	baz	Slart	Seems I have - sorry, when you said "reinstalled" earlier I read it as "restarted"
2010-02-22T15:47:00.000Z	Slart	baz	ah.. try the --reinstall switch with apt-get.. or synaptic
2010-02-22T15:47:00.000Z	baz	Slart	removed/re-installed package, seems to work now. No idea how that happened, this is on a RAID volume so that's a worry
2010-02-22T15:47:00.000Z	Slart	baz	and they say computers are predicatble =)
