2009-01-26T23:28:00.000Z	Necrosan		Uhh.
2009-01-26T23:28:00.000Z	Necrosan		xserver-xorg-video-sunffb is broken
2009-01-26T23:28:00.000Z	Necrosan		On intrepid
2009-01-26T23:28:00.000Z	Necrosan		Well, not broken; it wants an older version ofX
2009-01-26T23:29:00.000Z	Necrosan		It will work for sure, but apt-get is being lame
2009-01-26T23:29:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Necrosan	What changes have you made to your sources list
2009-01-26T23:30:00.000Z	Necrosan	Jack_Sparrow	None. it's stock as ever.
2009-01-26T23:30:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow		!info linux-restricted-modules
2009-01-26T23:30:00.000Z	Necrosan	Jack_Sparrow	this is a sparc64 install
2009-01-26T23:30:00.000Z	Necrosan		If that changes anything
2009-01-26T23:30:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Necrosan	What has been installed manually that may have changed dependencies and versioning
2009-01-26T23:31:00.000Z	Necrosan	Jack_Sparrow	I removed xserver-xorg-core, it wants an older version
2009-01-26T23:31:00.000Z	Necrosan		I did that, reinstalled ubuntu-desktop, and it still borks.
2009-01-26T23:31:00.000Z	Necrosan		Looks like the maintainer isn't keeping it up to date
2009-01-26T23:33:00.000Z	Necrosan	Jack_Sparrow	no way to force it?
2009-01-26T23:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Necrosan	I wont force anything, I try to look more at why something needs to be forced and work from there
2009-01-26T23:35:00.000Z	Necrosan	Jack_Sparrow	-force=yes didn't fix it anyway.
2009-01-26T23:35:00.000Z	Necrosan		It really looks like ports.ubuntu.com is out of date
2009-01-26T23:35:00.000Z	Necrosan		with sparc64 binaries
2009-01-26T23:36:00.000Z	Necrosan		unless a commit is going on right now (highly unlikely)
2009-01-26T23:36:00.000Z	Necrosan	Jack_Sparrow	Also having a problem getting linux-sparc64-smp to install..
