2010-06-18T18:13:00.000Z	slayerdme		I have a problem with my network/router setup and I can't figure it out. Let's say my router is at 1.2.3.4 or example.com, and I have 2 computers at 192.168.1.10, and 192.168.1.20, I've set up ssh on both. If I do 'ssh 192.168.1.10' then everything works. Connecting from outside the network like 'ssh 1.2.3.4' or 'ssh example.com' works also - i've done port 22 forwarding to 192.168.1.10:22. But from either computer, if I do 'ssh 1.2.3.4' it doesn't wor
2010-06-18T18:13:00.000Z	slayerdme		k. Why would that be? Both are clean installed. (No ssh configs, no iptables config, no nothing)
2010-06-18T18:14:00.000Z	phlak_user	slayerdme	that can never be done because both the PCs are on the LAN interface of the router and you cant reach the WAN IP from within the LAN due to NATting
2010-06-18T18:15:00.000Z	slayerdme	phlak_user	can you elaborate a bit?
2010-06-18T18:15:00.000Z	phlak_user	slayerdme	it means that you cant ring the doorbell of your house from inside the house
2010-06-18T18:16:00.000Z	phlak_user	slayerdme	if that were a good analogy
2010-06-18T18:16:00.000Z	phlak_user	slayerdme	you cant fix it. you need to use the LAN IP of the router to ssh into it
2010-06-18T18:16:00.000Z	phlak_user	slayerdme	which is in your case most probably 192.168.1.1
2010-06-18T18:17:00.000Z	phlak_user	slayerdme	is there something that prevents you from sshing using the LAN ip of the router?
2010-06-18T18:27:00.000Z	phlak_user	slayerdme	good for you!
2010-06-18T18:28:00.000Z	phlak_user	slayerdme	so example.com will never be accessed from the internet by anyone else?
2010-06-18T18:29:00.000Z	slayerdme	phlak_user	yes it can be accesed, because the router forwards it to 192.168.1.10.. i've tried it using 'hidemyass.com'
2010-06-18T18:33:00.000Z	phlak_user	slayerdme	if you have configured the virtualhost "yourwebsite.com" to listen on 192.168.1.10 , how will it get routed to your router in the first place from say my PC?
2010-06-18T18:33:00.000Z	phlak_user	slayerdme	nvm, if it works for you, its prolly right :)
2010-06-18T18:34:00.000Z	slayerdme	phlak_user	well i've configured the DNS servers to route requests to my router ip.. that routs it to my computer
2010-06-18T18:35:00.000Z	phlak_user	slayerdme	oh ok;
2010-06-18T18:36:00.000Z	phlak_user	slayerdme	just ensure that the router is configured for a static ip or use dynamic dns
2010-06-18T18:36:00.000Z	slayerdme	phlak_user	i have a static ip
2010-06-18T18:36:00.000Z	phlak_user	slayerdme	great
2010-06-18T18:37:00.000Z	phlak_user	slayerdme	also, if the machine 192.168.1.10 is on dhcp, then you have an issue
2010-06-18T18:39:00.000Z	phlak_user	slayerdme	ok
