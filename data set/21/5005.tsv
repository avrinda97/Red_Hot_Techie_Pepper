2008-01-15T00:44:00.000Z	Jod-s		Hello, could anyone lead me in a wireless issue with a laptop, please?
2008-01-15T00:45:00.000Z	Jod-s		Hi, could anyone...?
2008-01-15T00:46:00.000Z	Jod-s		Noone for help?
2008-01-15T00:46:00.000Z	Jod-s		Is there anyone that knows about wireless issues in Ubuntu 7.10, please?
2008-01-15T00:46:00.000Z	x4nd1	Jod-s	maybe I can help you (at least try to)
2008-01-15T00:48:00.000Z	x4nd1	Jod-s	it should be installed by default in 7.10
2008-01-15T00:49:00.000Z	x4nd1	Jod-s	it is called nm-applet
2008-01-15T00:50:00.000Z	Jod-s	x4nd1	But it doesn't appears..!
2008-01-15T00:50:00.000Z	x4nd1	Jod-s	please try to start it with Alt+F2 (you can also check if nm-applet is running with the command 'ps xa' in the console)
2008-01-15T00:53:00.000Z	x4nd1	Jod-s	is 'roaming mode' enabled on your network card
2008-01-15T00:56:00.000Z	x4nd1	Jod-s	afaik network manager manages only cards dat have roaming enabled
2008-01-15T00:58:00.000Z	Jod-s	x4nd1	OK, but if most of the times it turns its behavour to roaming mode, despite it isn't configured to do that..., the nm-applet in the systray doesnt exist
2008-01-15T01:12:00.000Z	Jod-s	x4nd1	added. System notifies me that it's necessary rebooting it... After that, do you mean a kill over de the ps number, that's right?
2008-01-15T01:00:00.000Z	Jod-s	x4nd1	another thing is that it seems that there is nothing called nm-applet in the package repositories... am I right?
2008-01-15T01:02:00.000Z	x4nd1	Jod-s	Do other applications (like pidgin) appear in the system tray? i think the packet is called 'network-manager' and network-manager-gnome
2008-01-15T01:04:00.000Z	Jod-s	x4nd1	Pidgin???? No! Right click over the systray... Network monitor, notes, and so on..
2008-01-15T01:05:00.000Z	Jod-s	x4nd1	I have installe EVERYTHING called networkmanager*, I checked it several times...
2008-01-15T01:09:00.000Z	x4nd1	Jod-s	try to add something called 'notification area' to another panel. then kill and restart nm-applet
2008-01-15T01:14:00.000Z	x4nd1	Jod-s	strange that it wants to reboot. if you want to restart the network manager you can do this with killall nm-applet and then start it againt
2008-01-15T01:16:00.000Z	Jod-s	x4nd1	I'm goint to reboot, see you..
2008-01-15T01:31:00.000Z	Jod-s	x4nd1	are you still there?
