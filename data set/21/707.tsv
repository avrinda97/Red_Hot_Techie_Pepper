2011-07-21T01:59:00.000Z	cook1es_	sudokill	thanks! How do I do that?
2011-07-21T01:59:00.000Z	sudokill	cook1es_	are you editing a file?
2011-07-21T02:00:00.000Z	sudokill	cook1es_	if so, edit it as root
2011-07-21T02:00:00.000Z	cook1es_	sudokill	No, trying to create a new one and putting it there
2011-07-21T02:00:00.000Z	sudokill	cook1es_	you can make it as user and use root to copy / move it
2011-07-21T02:02:00.000Z	cook1es_	sudokill	The paste is grayed out when I right click inside the /www/ folder
2011-07-21T02:02:00.000Z	sudokill	cook1es_	you dont use the paste button
2011-07-21T02:02:00.000Z	sudokill	cook1es_	sudo cp or mv
2011-07-21T02:03:00.000Z	cook1es_	sudokill	im supernew with the terminal, do I just type like sudo mv /desktop/ /var/www/ ??
2011-07-21T02:04:00.000Z	sudokill	cook1es_	yes, sudo mv (the file) to (the location)
2011-07-21T02:04:00.000Z	sudokill	cook1es_	tell me the the file and where you want to put it
2011-07-21T02:06:00.000Z	cook1es_	sudokill	oh cool! I experimented abit and did sudo geany and had root access with geany then. you probably said that though haha. anyways just for the knowledge sake.. from desktop/index.html to var/www/
2011-07-21T02:07:00.000Z	sudokill	cook1es_	yea you can run any app as root with sudo. but for graphical apps use gksu or gksudo, its not needed  most of the time but good practice
2011-07-21T02:07:00.000Z	cook1es_	sudokill	I assume that will cause the app not to close when I press ctrl+c?
2011-07-21T02:07:00.000Z	sudokill	cook1es_	no any app will close with ctrl c most the time
2011-07-21T02:08:00.000Z	cook1es_	sudokill	ah, what is the point of gksudo and is it possible to avoid that ctrl c thing?
2011-07-21T02:08:00.000Z	sudokill	cook1es_	just dont press ctrl+c
2011-07-21T02:09:00.000Z	cook1es_	sudokill	lol
2011-07-21T02:10:00.000Z	cook1es_	sudokill	thanks alot btw, it was very helpful
