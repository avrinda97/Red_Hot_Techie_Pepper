2012-10-06T16:51:00.000Z	Adie		is there a way to have ubuntu show me live hardware changed in my computer?
2012-10-06T16:51:00.000Z	Adie		*changes
2012-10-06T16:51:00.000Z	Adie		this is diagnostics.
2012-10-06T16:52:00.000Z	Adie		I am on windows right now, and some electronic devices in my room are causing my computer to beep beep as if there is a hardware change
2012-10-06T16:52:00.000Z	Adie		I am boggling my mind trying to figure out what piece of hardware is flickering or changing
2012-10-06T16:52:00.000Z	Adie		wonder if ubuntu would log that
2012-10-06T16:52:00.000Z	Adie		well, the standard windows "doo doo"
2012-10-06T16:52:00.000Z	Adie		like when you plug in a usb device
2012-10-06T16:52:00.000Z	Adie		but I see nothing showing me WHY it's doing that.
2012-10-06T16:54:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Adie	the only thing i can think of is doing lshw everytime, compare the lists to see if there is a change
2012-10-06T16:55:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Adie	if that is the case then it certainly is a windows issue
2012-10-06T16:55:00.000Z	Adie	ThinkT510	if I boot into ubuntu and replicate the issue, will you guys support me then? :|
2012-10-06T16:56:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Adie	we can only help with ubuntu issues, this sounds like a windows issue
2012-10-06T16:57:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Adie	sounds like a windows driver issue to me
2012-10-06T17:00:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Adie	surely only devices plugged into the computer will affect it
2012-10-06T17:00:00.000Z	Adie	ThinkT510	nope.
2012-10-06T17:01:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Adie	you don't have any giant magnets or stong signaling equipment?
2012-10-06T17:02:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Adie	why on earth do you suspect an aquarium pump?
2012-10-06T17:04:00.000Z	Adie	ThinkT510	because when I plug in my aquarium pump my computer detects a hardware change
2012-10-06T17:04:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Adie	when in windows?
2012-10-06T17:05:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Adie	what is a power conditioner?
