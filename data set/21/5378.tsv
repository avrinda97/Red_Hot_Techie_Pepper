2007-10-26T04:30:00.000Z	Sharpie		hello, I was wondering, was there a way to cancel the logon screen in gutsy?
2007-10-26T04:30:00.000Z	scguy318	Sharpie	auto-login?
2007-10-26T04:31:00.000Z	scguy318	Sharpie	well, you can either right click on the fast user switching applet and configure your login screen or w/e
2007-10-26T04:31:00.000Z	scguy318	Sharpie	then in one of the tabs check automatic login
2007-10-26T04:31:00.000Z	scguy318	Sharpie	System -> Administration -> Login Screen
2007-10-26T04:32:00.000Z	Sharpie	scguy318	thx, i'll check it out later (i'm on windows right now)
2007-10-26T04:32:00.000Z	Sharpie	scguy318	oh and another thing, is there a way to work as root all the time? (like, being able to write to boot drive instead of having to use sudo in the console?)
2007-10-26T04:33:00.000Z	scguy318	Sharpie	you shouldn't work AS root all the time, but you can mount partitions with ownership for your user account
2007-10-26T04:33:00.000Z	scguy318	Sharpie	oh, but you do
2007-10-26T04:33:00.000Z	scguy318	Sharpie	edit your fstab and add either umask=000 or some other flag for 777 on all files or ownership by your user account
2007-10-26T04:34:00.000Z	scguy318	Sharpie	owner=youraccountname
2007-10-26T04:34:00.000Z	scguy318	Sharpie	yep
2007-10-26T04:34:00.000Z	scguy318	Sharpie	not necessarily
2007-10-26T04:35:00.000Z	scguy318	Sharpie	im clueless on that matter
2007-11-06T13:41:00.000Z	scguy318	Sharpie	seamless integration of Ubuntu repo with Firefox plugins, something like that ish
2007-11-06T13:42:00.000Z	Sharpie	scguy318	and it disables the update button, so i can't get 2.0.0.9
2007-11-06T13:42:00.000Z	scguy318	Sharpie	can't upgrade Firefox unless you want to do it yourself :P
2007-11-06T13:42:00.000Z	scguy318	Sharpie	since Ubuntu is all about version stability
2007-11-29T03:59:00.000Z	scguy318	Sharpie	remove the quiet/splash boot flags from your menu.lst
2007-11-29T03:59:00.000Z	Sharpie	scguy318	aight, thx =o
2007-11-29T04:02:00.000Z	Sharpie	scguy318	does it skip comments that aren't at the beginning of the line too? (/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.22-14-generic root=UUID=6e687ec5-99f6-4cd9-a8c0-c01871fd3dea ro #quiet splash)
