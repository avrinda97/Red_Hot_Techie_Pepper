2010-06-05T09:23:00.000Z	Tonisius		How can I debug my preseed/kickstart system, the append paramter is not being used:   append auto preseed/url=http://192.168.1.250/lucid_x86_kickseed.cfg initrd=ubuntu/lucid/amd64/initrd.gz -- quiet
2010-06-05T09:24:00.000Z	Tonisius		but the PXE client is booting from the correct kernel, and i can cat /proc/cmdline and it shows what is appended to the kernel command, but the installer is still asking me questions....
2010-06-05T09:24:00.000Z	Tonisius		I am doing a tail -f on my apache log for that server, the installer never tries to download it, any ideas?
2010-06-05T09:25:00.000Z	aruntomar	Tonisius	use the key combination ctrl+shift+f4
2010-06-05T09:25:00.000Z	Tonisius	aruntomar	and what do I need to look for?
2010-06-05T09:25:00.000Z	Tonisius	aruntomar	I don't see any errors, and its not letting me scroll up
2010-06-05T09:26:00.000Z	aruntomar	Tonisius	yes, it won't let u scroll
2010-06-05T09:26:00.000Z	aruntomar	Tonisius	what is the problem u r facing for which u would like to debug
2010-06-05T09:26:00.000Z	Tonisius	aruntomar	but what could I be looking for, I see DEBUG stuff, but no ERROR or ALERT's there
2010-06-05T09:27:00.000Z	aruntomar	Tonisius	if there r no errors, then ur setup is working fine :)
2010-06-05T09:28:00.000Z	Tonisius	aruntomar	the whole point of a preseed and using the auto kernel option is that it shouldn't be asking me any questions
2010-06-05T09:29:00.000Z	aruntomar	Tonisius	ok, so basically ur kickstart file is not getting used or accessed for installation
2010-06-05T09:29:00.000Z	Tonisius	aruntomar	correct
2010-06-05T09:30:00.000Z	Tonisius	aruntomar	it's not getting accessed at all, I'm watching all logs that pertain to the webserver hosting it
2010-06-05T09:30:00.000Z	Tonisius	aruntomar	I can continue the installation, and when installing packages it will obtain them from my webserver, so I know i'm watching the right place
2010-06-05T09:31:00.000Z	aruntomar	Tonisius	u need to insert a different line, rather than the preseed stuff, just a min, i'll tell u that
2010-06-05T09:36:00.000Z	aruntomar	Tonisius	in ur text.cfg file append install=url_to_ur_kickstart_file
2010-06-05T09:37:00.000Z	Tonisius	aruntomar	I'll try that
2010-06-05T09:38:00.000Z	aruntomar	Tonisius	i'm getting debootstrap error when it tries to install the base component, r u facing anything like that
2010-06-05T09:38:00.000Z	Tonisius	aruntomar	no, nothing like that, and it still ignores the append options
2010-06-05T09:42:00.000Z	Tonisius	aruntomar	I got the problem, and I know what it is now
