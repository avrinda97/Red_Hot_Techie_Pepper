2007-12-11T11:55:00.000Z	Narissa		My tty is distorted once X starts, how do I fix this (by distorted I mean unusable)
2007-12-11T11:56:00.000Z	nickrud	Narissa	by unusable, what do you mean?
2007-12-11T11:56:00.000Z	Narissa	nickrud	unreadable white blocks and heavily distorted text
2007-12-11T11:59:00.000Z	nickrud	Narissa	I have something similar, 40 x 16 characters. I just removed the splash word from the /boot/grub/menu.lst lines starting with kernel. Not a great fix, it removes the startup splash screen, but the console is usable
2007-12-11T12:00:00.000Z	Narissa	nickrud	I did remove splash, and quiet.  I have vga=ask, but one X service starts it changes the resolution and then it's unreadable, until then tty is fine
2007-12-11T12:00:00.000Z	nickrud	Narissa	remove the vga=ask as well, that's trying to bring up the framebuffer.
2007-12-11T12:01:00.000Z	Narissa	nickrud	okay I will do that, and then will relog here and let you know how that goes
2007-12-11T12:01:00.000Z	nickrud	Narissa	it's not a very good fix, but it works. I'm used to watching a lot of text fly by on startup, anyway
2007-12-11T12:02:00.000Z	nickrud	Narissa	that is, Works for Meâ„¢
2007-12-11T12:04:00.000Z	Narissa	nickrud	no dice still distorted
2007-12-11T12:05:00.000Z	nickrud	Narissa	I'm not sure then. I figured it was framebuffer related. What video chip?
2007-12-11T12:05:00.000Z	Narissa	nickrud	nVidia series 7
2007-12-11T12:06:00.000Z	nickrud	Narissa	no real experience with nvidia, in fact I'm not used to seeing people with issues on those
2007-12-11T12:06:00.000Z	Narissa	nickrud	I am also having an issue with being forced to use Option SWCursor just to have a working mouse cursor
2007-12-11T12:07:00.000Z	nickrud	Narissa	have you installed the nvidia drivers from nvidia by any chance?
2007-12-11T12:07:00.000Z	Narissa	nickrud	yeah and attemtping to install the newest, but can't seem to read term so it makes it a moot point
2007-12-11T12:08:00.000Z	nickrud	Narissa	hm. For a baseline, you could make a backup of your xorg.conf , and run sudo dpkg-reconfigure -pcritical to get the default config back. See if that restores your tty
2007-12-11T12:09:00.000Z	nickrud	Narissa	that is, sudo dpkg-reconfigure -pcritical xserver-xorg
2007-12-11T12:10:00.000Z	Narissa	nickrud	from x how would I go about rebooting into init 3 without x starting?
2007-12-11T12:11:00.000Z	nickrud	Narissa	there's no diff between runlevels 2-5 in ubuntu; you would do sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop X and have only the consoles
2007-12-11T12:13:00.000Z	nickrud	Narissa	I've got a weak brain tonight, its sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop   , I elided to stop
