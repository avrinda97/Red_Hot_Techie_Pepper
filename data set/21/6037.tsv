2007-09-06T16:21:00.000Z	stefg	unagi	yes... by uninstalling the nvidia-package and using the official method :-)

2008-01-08T01:32:00.000Z	stefg	unagi	the convention with ubuntus flavor of gnome is: drives in /media get desktop icons, other locations don't. so if you have it in , say, /mnt it will not show on desktop
2008-01-08T01:33:00.000Z	stefg	unagi	you have a corresponding /etc/fstab entry and 'user' in the options column ?
2008-01-08T01:35:00.000Z	stefg	unagi	hmmm.... ntfs needs special options
2008-01-09T02:46:00.000Z	stefg	unagi	that was default behaviour until dapper (?) ... people kept complaining, so it was changed :-\
2008-01-09T02:46:00.000Z	stefg	unagi	iirc it's in the screensaver preferences
