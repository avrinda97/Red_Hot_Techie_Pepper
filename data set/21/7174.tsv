2008-04-06T19:17:00.000Z	Slart	Shadow_	what kind of flicker?
2008-04-06T19:26:00.000Z	Slart	Shadow_	remove the word splash
2008-04-06T19:26:00.000Z	Slart	Shadow_	and save the file
2008-04-06T19:18:00.000Z	Slart	Shadow_	after the login?
2008-04-06T19:18:00.000Z	Slart	Shadow_	have you tried changing the login window background to black?
2008-04-06T19:18:00.000Z	Slart	Shadow_	I think it's in System, Preferences, Login window
2008-04-06T19:20:00.000Z	Slart	Shadow_	ahh.. the splash screen..
2008-04-06T19:21:00.000Z	Slart	Shadow_	you can disable the splashscreen by changing a line in the grub boot settings file.. /boot/grub/menu.lst
2008-04-06T19:21:00.000Z	Slart	Shadow_	open the file by running this in a terminal, gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
2008-04-06T19:23:00.000Z	Slart	Shadow_	well.. I don't know how to *fix* the splash screen.. but I can tell you how to remove it.
2008-04-06T19:25:00.000Z	Slart	Shadow_	in that file should be a line starting with   # defoptions=
2008-04-06T19:25:00.000Z	Slart	Shadow_	you probably have some stuff after the equals-char
2008-04-06T19:26:00.000Z	Slart	Shadow_	quiet splash ?
2008-04-06T19:28:00.000Z	Slart	Shadow_	I was talking about the line *starting* with # defoptions=... there are other lines containing the words quiet, splash etc
