2009-12-30T09:42:00.000Z	IdleOne	scunizi_	it is sorta like running a mini ircd that connects to freenode and then you connect your client to "your" server. when you disconnect your client the bnc keeps your nick online.
2009-12-30T09:42:00.000Z	scunizi_	IdleOne	what's the benefit over screen and irssi?
2009-12-30T09:43:00.000Z	IdleOne	scunizi_	you can also give accounts to other users to connect to the bnc
2009-12-30T09:43:00.000Z	scunizi_	IdleOne	and will they be using your nick or one they setup?
2009-12-30T09:43:00.000Z	IdleOne	scunizi_	their own nick
2009-12-30T09:44:00.000Z	scunizi_	IdleOne	and can the others talk within themselves through the bnc without bouncing to freenode or whereever?
2009-12-30T09:44:00.000Z	IdleOne	scunizi_	yes ZNC has that feature, I guess most bnc's have it
2009-12-30T09:45:00.000Z	scunizi_	IdleOne	k.. guess I'm still missing the point of it other then a remote irc server that connects directly to an actual irc server..  I'll have to mull it over
2009-12-30T09:46:00.000Z	IdleOne	scunizi_	basically let's say you wanted to give your customers a way of contacting you via irc you could setup the bnc to freenode and then have the bnc auto forward to #scunizi for example
2009-12-30T09:47:00.000Z	scunizi_	IdleOne	so customers would connect to the bnc and it would relay to you nomatter what channel you're on?
2009-12-30T09:48:00.000Z	scunizi_	IdleOne	or #scunizi would be an inhouse bnc server hosted channel even though nick scunizi is also connected to other channels?
2009-12-30T09:48:00.000Z	IdleOne	scunizi_	not exactly. when they connect to the bnc they would be sent to #example. you would have to be in that #
2009-12-30T09:49:00.000Z	IdleOne	scunizi_	from what I understand bnc's were used back in the day when networks didn't use nickserv.
2009-12-30T09:49:00.000Z	scunizi_	IdleOne	and that's something you set within the bnc so when they connect they're routed directly to a specific channel you're monitoring?
2009-12-30T09:50:00.000Z	IdleOne	scunizi_	and there is also the feature that when you reconnect your client you get a playback of what was said while you were gone.
2009-12-30T09:50:00.000Z	IdleOne	scunizi_	yes the #example routing is set in the bnc
2009-12-30T09:50:00.000Z	scunizi_	IdleOne	k.. starting to see the light :).. intersting..
2009-12-30T09:52:00.000Z	IdleOne	scunizi_	we used to use bnc back when on EFnet. they didn't have nickserv ( not sure they do now )
2009-12-30T09:53:00.000Z	scunizi_	IdleOne	old school stuff. I like it.. I use to run a part time BBS on a 1200baud modem :)
2009-12-30T09:54:00.000Z	IdleOne	scunizi_	you are old lol!
2009-12-30T09:54:00.000Z	scunizi_	IdleOne	:)  will hit 50 in 3 mths
