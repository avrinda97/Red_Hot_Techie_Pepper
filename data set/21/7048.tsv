2007-09-16T12:00:00.000Z	hendrixski	astro76	vocx, oh... I'll do that then... thanks
2007-10-20T21:03:00.000Z	astro76	hendrixski	I did it up there ^ it's !il ;)
2007-10-20T21:03:00.000Z	hendrixski	astro76	ah, Ok
2007-12-20T04:29:00.000Z	astro76	hendrixski	err just see? then a simple .htaccess and .htpasswd file, editing also? then a wiki or cms
2007-12-20T04:30:00.000Z	hendrixski	astro76	I'll google the .htaccess and .htpasswd thing
2007-12-20T04:31:00.000Z	astro76	hendrixski	let me know if you can't find anything, but info is all over ;)
2007-12-20T04:34:00.000Z	hendrixski	astro76	undeclaredx ah... so just modifying the .htaccess file on Apache can limit which users see which content, the users being the ones specified in the htpasswd file
2007-12-20T04:34:00.000Z	hendrixski	astro76	undeclaredx so then the only thing that a PHP script needs to do is maintain those files? Sweet!!!
2007-12-20T04:34:00.000Z	astro76	hendrixski	indeed, there's an htpasswd command to create the file and add/modify entries
2007-12-20T04:35:00.000Z	astro76	hendrixski	the .htpasswd file
2007-12-20T04:35:00.000Z	hendrixski	astro76	undeclaredx ... now... does this work only on Apache, I'm not sure if my friends didn't do something stupid like use IIS ... this script wouldn't work there, eh?
2007-12-20T04:36:00.000Z	astro76	hendrixski	never touched IIS thankfully ;)
2007-12-20T04:36:00.000Z	astro76	hendrixski	so dunno, sorry
2007-12-20T04:40:00.000Z	astro76	hendrixski	this is the basic minimal entry http://pastebin.com/d1c43f025
2007-12-20T04:41:00.000Z	hendrixski	astro76	rock on!  and this is just a shell script?
2007-12-20T04:41:00.000Z	astro76	hendrixski	just a text file which apache reads
2007-12-20T04:42:00.000Z	hendrixski	astro76	ah, cool.   thanks a TON
2007-12-20T04:43:00.000Z	astro76	hendrixski	two points: you can place them in multiple directories; and they apply to subdirectories
2007-12-20T04:43:00.000Z	astro76	hendrixski	though I typically maintain one .htpasswd file
2007-12-20T04:44:00.000Z	hendrixski	astro76	yeah, I'm browsing through some documentation on how to implement the htaccess stuff.  I'm convinced that it's better than what I was gonna try to do (have PHP code to log users in, and sessions with only dynamcally generated pages, and crap like that)
