2009-10-27T18:18:00.000Z	sobczyk	godfather	if you set i attribute even root can't change the file, if can something is broken

2009-10-27T18:24:00.000Z	sobczyk	godfather	it should be +i my mistake there
2009-10-27T18:25:00.000Z	sobczyk	godfather	just remember when you want to change the file you neet to clean the 'i' flag
2009-10-27T18:25:00.000Z	sobczyk	godfather	yes that should do it
2009-10-27T18:25:00.000Z	godfather	sobczyk	i reboot
2009-10-27T18:25:00.000Z	sobczyk	godfather	though now nothing can change that file unless you clean the i flag
2009-10-27T18:28:00.000Z	godfather	sobczyk	nice job, now works, ty
2009-10-27T18:29:00.000Z	sobczyk	godfather	write down the i flag thing, it caused me a lot of headaches when I wanted to change the file and forgot about clearing the flag
2009-10-27T18:30:00.000Z	godfather	sobczyk	i will remember it
2009-10-27T18:33:00.000Z	godfather	sobczyk	any idea about that?
