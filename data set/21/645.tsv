2011-08-14T22:35:00.000Z	roo45		Hi all. I'm getting a lot of frozen UI elements (windows, buttons, icons, etc.). Things freeze sporadically starting immediately after I log in. Logging in to a new user fixes the problem temporarily, even on my old account. Does anyone know what the problem might be?
2011-08-14T22:36:00.000Z	dr_willis	roo45	 you may want to be doing a memtest to check that out.  and monitor dmesg output when it happens.
2011-08-14T22:37:00.000Z	roo45	dr_willis	I did a memtest at boot, it came back fine. I've also done a badblocks test and it was fine. Booting from the LiveCD also works fine. I can do the memtest again if you think it will help.
2011-08-14T22:38:00.000Z	dr_willis	roo45	 a memtest for how long.. also alternative testing of various live cd's to see if the issue affects them. would point into it being either an OS issue..or a hardware issue.
2011-08-14T22:38:00.000Z	dr_willis	roo45	 whats your video chipset? the live cd  may be using differnt video drivers.
2011-08-14T22:39:00.000Z	roo45	dr_willis	I selected memtest86+ at boot
2011-08-14T22:39:00.000Z	dr_willis	roo45	 for how long did you run it?
2011-08-14T22:40:00.000Z	roo45	dr_willis	nvidia GTX 460 GPU. Custom drivers probably weren't installed on the LiveCD, but they are on the second user account where things are working.
2011-08-14T22:40:00.000Z	roo45	dr_willis	I let the memtest run until it said it had completed.
2011-08-14T22:41:00.000Z	roo45	dr_willis	probably took about 2 hours?
2011-08-14T22:44:00.000Z	dr_willis	roo45	 so a second user account works totally fine?
2011-08-14T22:45:00.000Z	roo45	dr_willis	Yes, totally fine. What's more is that if I login to that account, logout, and login to my original account, everything is fine there. Until I suspend or restart. Then I have to do the process again to get it working.
2011-08-14T22:46:00.000Z	dr_willis	roo45	 if a 2nd user works totally fine that basically points it to being some odd user setting issue for the problem user.
2011-08-14T22:47:00.000Z	roo45	dr_willis	I agree. But I have no clue what settings to look at or delete. I didn't change anything (besides updating my system). The problem exists on both Unity and GNOME 2, so I don't think it's Unity related. I don't know enough about the UI to know what to look for.
2011-08-14T22:47:00.000Z	dr_willis	roo45	 simple.. remove them all.... :)
2011-08-14T22:48:00.000Z	dr_willis	roo45	 unity and the 'classic' desktop are using the same underlaying stuff..
2011-08-14T22:48:00.000Z	dr_willis	roo45	 theres commands to totally reset compiz and unity.
2011-08-14T22:49:00.000Z	roo45	dr_willis	I've done unity --reset and gconftool-2 --recursive-unset /apps/compiz-1
2011-08-14T22:49:00.000Z	roo45	dr_willis	no effect.
2011-08-14T22:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	roo45	 how odd..  i guess you could go hardcore and clean out your entire home dir.. (move everything over to some subdir) and log out/back in...
2011-08-14T22:51:00.000Z	roo45	dr_willis	Yeah, that may be what I end up doing. Frustrating, but feasible.
