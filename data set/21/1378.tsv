2010-11-06T12:57:00.000Z	Furi		but that's all i can get to
2010-11-06T12:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Furi	Try selecting a previous kernel version.
2010-11-06T12:57:00.000Z	Furi	Jordan_U	EXACT same thing happens, even if i choose the recovery mode on THAT
2010-11-06T12:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Furi	Does adding "init=/bin/bash" as a kernel parameter get you a shell?
2010-11-06T12:58:00.000Z	Furi	Jordan_U	i don't understand
2010-11-06T12:59:00.000Z	Furi	Jordan_U	on bash?
2010-11-06T12:59:00.000Z	Furi	Jordan_U	i mean, on grub
2010-11-06T13:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Furi	At the grub menu press 'e' to edit one of the entries. Add "init=/bin/bash" to the list of kernel parameters (after "ro quiet splash" and on the same line).
2010-11-06T13:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Furi	Then press ctrl+X to execute this modified entry.
2010-11-06T13:02:00.000Z	Furi	Jordan_U	bash: cannot set terminal process group (-1): Inappropriate ioctl for device
2010-11-06T13:03:00.000Z	Furi	Jordan_U	bash: no job control in this shell
2010-11-06T13:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Furi	Does it still give you a shell?
2010-11-06T13:03:00.000Z	Furi	Jordan_U	and it says i'm bash@(none)
2010-11-06T13:03:00.000Z	Furi	Jordan_U	i think
2010-11-06T13:03:00.000Z	Furi	Jordan_U	idk what you mean by shell, do you mean like a command line?
2010-11-06T13:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Furi	Yes.
2010-11-06T13:04:00.000Z	Furi	Jordan_U	yeah
2010-11-06T13:05:00.000Z	Furi	Jordan_U	what do i do?
2010-11-06T13:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Furi	Ignore rinku_kokiri's advice. It has nothing to do with your problem, and wouldn't work even if it did.
2010-11-06T13:06:00.000Z	Furi	Jordan_U	but what should i do, then? i'm at a command line as root@none...
2010-11-06T13:09:00.000Z	Furi	Jordan_U	what should i do?
