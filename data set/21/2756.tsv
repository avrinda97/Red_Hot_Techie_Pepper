2009-07-20T15:39:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	wild_oscar	What command line?
2009-07-20T15:39:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	wild_oscar	You're trying to install PUEL Virtualbox?
2009-07-20T15:40:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	wild_oscar	Err, can you send the link of what you're trying to follow?
2009-07-20T15:40:00.000Z	wild_oscar	leaf-sheep	or the OSE
2009-07-20T15:40:00.000Z	wild_oscar	leaf-sheep	http://www.virtualbox.org/
2009-07-20T15:40:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	wild_oscar	You know the differences, right?
2009-07-20T15:41:00.000Z	wild_oscar	leaf-sheep	yeah, OSE is probably a headache to install, doesn't have usb but won't have issues if I install it on my company's server
2009-07-20T15:42:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	wild_oscar	PUEL is more headache than OSE, I think.  OSE is already in Ubuntu repo, I believe.
2009-07-20T15:43:00.000Z	wild_oscar	leaf-sheep	isn't it the other way around? I thought it was the PUEL which was on the repos
2009-07-20T15:43:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	wild_oscar	You have it the other way. ;)
2009-07-20T15:44:00.000Z	wild_oscar	leaf-sheep	is OSE in the official 9.04 repos?
2009-07-20T15:44:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	wild_oscar	Yes.
2009-07-20T15:44:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	wild_oscar	Here you go. :)
2009-07-20T15:45:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	wild_oscar	Yup. Ubuntu only update security fixes.  You may get virtualbox-ose 3.0 in karmic.
2009-07-20T15:55:00.000Z	wild_oscar	leaf-sheep	do you use Virtualbox exclusively through a shell?
2009-07-20T15:56:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	wild_oscar	What do you mean?  I install Virtualbox and start it from GUI, although I think that can be accomplished via shell too.
2009-07-20T15:57:00.000Z	wild_oscar	leaf-sheep	relates to my previous desktop vs server edition question - installing desktop edition means installing all its crap (office, gimp, etc), when all I really want is server + an X desktop for virtualbox management
2009-07-20T15:58:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	wild_oscar	I'm not sure what you're trying to accomplish.  Why do you want X on your server?
2009-07-20T15:59:00.000Z	wild_oscar	leaf-sheep	it is where I'm putting Virtualbox
2009-07-20T15:59:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	wild_oscar	Servers don't use GUI at all.  Also, people at #ubuntu-server can help you figure out what you want.  There also are virtualization which could do the job too.
2009-07-20T16:01:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	wild_oscar	I use/run it on my laptop.  Not the server.
