2007-02-22T09:04:00.000Z	VolkerOS	ki-eye	i had to compile a driver for my d-link
2007-02-22T09:04:00.000Z	ki-eye	VolkerOS	I've found a few mentions of it, but none that worked specifically... I saw someone mentaion ndiswrapper
2007-02-22T09:05:00.000Z	VolkerOS	ki-eye	why not?

2007-02-22T09:06:00.000Z	ki-eye	VolkerOS	it bombs out with a bunch of implicit declarations
2007-02-22T09:07:00.000Z	VolkerOS	ki-eye	i assume you've gone to larsen-b.com?
2007-02-22T09:09:00.000Z	ki-eye	VolkerOS	no.. I hadn't seen that, so I can just use the broadcom drivers?
2007-02-22T09:10:00.000Z	VolkerOS	ki-eye	try http://www.larsen-b.com/Article/103.html
2007-02-22T09:10:00.000Z	VolkerOS	ki-eye	they have the commands there that should walk you through it...
2007-02-22T09:11:00.000Z	ki-eye	VolkerOS	perfect, just what I was looking for..
2007-02-22T09:11:00.000Z	VolkerOS	ki-eye	awesome
2007-02-22T09:12:00.000Z	VolkerOS	ki-eye	it might have some bugs, but then again what linux wifi drivers dont...
