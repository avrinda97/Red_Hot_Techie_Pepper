2012-08-26T18:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	py_can	can you telnet to the socket from another PC? Can clients ping the server
2012-08-26T18:41:00.000Z	py_can	ActionParsnip	I can connect to it internally
2012-08-26T18:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	py_can	so only outside your LAN is the issue?
2012-08-26T18:41:00.000Z	py_can	ActionParsnip	i have forwarded ports on my router just fine. The vsftpd just responds with an unroutable address for external clients

2012-08-26T18:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	py_can	try:  ftp -vv user@server    from external, see what happens, also check ftp logs
