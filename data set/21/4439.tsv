2008-05-04T19:08:00.000Z	ldiamond		How do I run fsck on a USB HARD DRIVE?
2008-05-04T19:09:00.000Z	ldiamond		no such file or directory, how do I know what device is mapped to my USB drive???
2008-05-04T19:10:00.000Z	ldiamond		but how do I know?
2008-05-04T19:12:00.000Z	ldiamond		How can I know what device my USB Hard Drive is mapped to? (/dev/XXXX ???)
2008-05-04T19:14:00.000Z	ldiamond		I get "Bad Magic Number on super-block" When running fsck on my USB Hard Disk... why ???
2008-05-04T19:15:00.000Z	ldiamond		well, I know its /dev/sdc
2008-05-04T19:15:00.000Z	ldiamond		and I run sudo fsck /dev/sdc
2008-05-04T19:16:00.000Z	ldiamond		Im not trying to reformat it.
2008-05-04T19:17:00.000Z	ldiamond		Im trying to check if its working correctly. I installed Ubuntu on it, and it will not boot.
2008-05-04T19:18:00.000Z	ldiamond		It always hangs there: "Attached scsi generic sg2 type 0"
2008-05-04T19:18:00.000Z	tony55	ldiamond	oh well  did you install it via wubi or install it from livecd?
2008-05-04T19:22:00.000Z	tony55	ldiamond	don't install it on the usb hd
2008-05-04T19:30:00.000Z	tony55	ldiamond	xubuntu uses the xcfe desktop
2008-05-04T19:31:00.000Z	tony55	ldiamond	kubuntu prob has more stuff on it cuz kde adds more things
2008-05-04T19:35:00.000Z	tony55	ldiamond	try useing the livecd of each and decide from that
2008-05-04T19:36:00.000Z	tony55	ldiamond	xubuntu is a lightweight desktop and uses less programs
2008-05-04T20:05:00.000Z	tony55	ldiamond	won't let me send message cuxz i not a registered user
2008-05-04T20:08:00.000Z	tony55	ldiamond	oh hmmm then it prob can't d it since usb port has not been opened at bootup or boot menu
2008-05-04T20:10:00.000Z	tony55	ldiamond	hmm might still be that linux has not opened the usb port
2008-05-04T20:16:00.000Z	tony55	ldiamond	maybe you need to set usb hd as first bootable drive? thou that prob screw up you being able to boot windows???
2008-05-04T20:18:00.000Z	tony55	ldiamond	error likely cuz it can't open usb drive to get to /boot
