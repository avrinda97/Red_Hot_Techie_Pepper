2006-01-09T11:40:00.000Z	pi9inE		yeah LOL :D

2006-01-09T11:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pi9inE	 check the dvd - what files are on it?
2006-01-09T11:41:00.000Z	pi9inE	Dr_Willis	just a sec. my man
2006-01-09T11:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pi9inE	 sadly B.A.O does not do dvd images.. i had to use NERO for that.
2006-01-09T11:47:00.000Z	pi9inE	Dr_Willis	can I send you via DCC a .jpg what's on DVD cause imageshack.us looks broken
2006-01-09T11:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pi9inE	 not really :P it is just 1 huge iso file? or a lot of little files? is the question
2006-01-09T11:48:00.000Z	pi9inE	Dr_Willis	now it's extracted .iso file
2006-01-09T11:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pi9inE	 hmm.. ive seen cases where people mess up and burn the 'whatever.iso' as a file to a disk.. and get a disk with just 'whatever.iso' on it. :P
2006-01-09T11:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pi9inE	 it dosent sound like you did it that way however.
2006-01-09T11:49:00.000Z	pi9inE	Dr_Willis	no, don't worry :)
2006-01-09T11:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pi9inE	 heh - odd that the dvd isent booting..
2006-01-09T11:49:00.000Z	pi9inE	Dr_Willis	what can I do? :-/
2006-01-09T11:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pi9inE	 you dont have a older dvd drive that needs dvd+r or -r and got the wrong kind of disk  do ya?
2006-01-09T11:50:00.000Z	pi9inE	Dr_Willis	not, all working perfectly fine
2006-01-09T11:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pi9inE	 i fouight a laptop for 5 hrs with THAT issue once. :P
2006-01-09T11:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pi9inE	 i suggest gust getting the cdrom iso image..
2006-01-09T11:50:00.000Z	pi9inE	Dr_Willis	I had yesterday, but wasn't working, that's why I've choosed DVD .iso
