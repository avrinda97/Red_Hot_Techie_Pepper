Linux, Unix and other Unix-like computer operating systems are generally regarded as very well-protected, but not immune, from computer viruses.
2012-11-03T08:24:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	juniour	I will agree to disagree. ;)
2012-11-03T08:25:00.000Z	juniour	wilee-nilee	it is protected as virus didnt get the root access
2012-11-03T08:25:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	juniour	It is not whether it can happen, it is that there are none know to be on the web, you mentioned a virus I commented on a virus.
