2007-08-24T14:18:00.000Z	kimmey2k3		What about adding it to system -> preferences -> sessions -> and adding it to the startup list with necessary commands?
2007-08-24T14:18:00.000Z	Whiz2	kimmey2k3	you've completely lost me
2007-08-24T14:18:00.000Z	Whiz2		i know very little about this kinda thing
2007-08-24T14:21:00.000Z	kimmey2k3	Whiz2	I dont understand you, or you dont know how to add? :P
2007-08-24T14:21:00.000Z	Whiz2		exactly :-p
2007-08-24T14:22:00.000Z	kimmey2k3		Go to system - preferences - sessions
2007-08-24T14:22:00.000Z	Whiz2	kimmey2k3	I didn't even know that kubuntu had serviceslol
2007-08-24T14:22:00.000Z	kimmey2k3		then you see the tab "startup programs"
2007-08-24T14:22:00.000Z	kimmey2k3		just lick on the "new"-button and add
2007-08-24T14:22:00.000Z	kimmey2k3		click
2007-08-24T14:24:00.000Z	Whiz2	kimmey2k3	system services run before kde?
2007-08-24T14:24:00.000Z	kimmey2k3		im not sure about it, but you can test
2007-08-24T14:27:00.000Z	Whiz2	kimmey2k3	the service is there set to run as a specific script, but I want to know how to make it run as me, instead of root
2007-08-24T14:28:00.000Z	Whiz2	kimmey2k3	if it runs as root, it is useless to me
2007-08-24T14:29:00.000Z	kimmey2k3		im not sure about that
2007-08-24T14:29:00.000Z	kimmey2k3		but it shouldnt be too hard to fix
2007-08-24T14:29:00.000Z	Whiz2		i just need to know the command to put in the script, so it runs right ;-)
2007-08-24T14:30:00.000Z	Whiz2		i use kubuntu :-)
2007-08-24T14:30:00.000Z	Whiz2		feisty fawn
2007-08-24T14:31:00.000Z	kimmey2k3		sorry but im not so into scripting yet
2007-08-24T14:31:00.000Z	Whiz2	kimmey2k3	tyanyway
