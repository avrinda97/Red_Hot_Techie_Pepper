2008-05-11T15:33:00.000Z	ak5		hello - can someone tell me how to get my volume keys on lappy to change PCM instead of master?
2008-05-11T15:33:00.000Z	ak5		:D
2008-05-11T15:33:00.000Z	rutgermasi	ak5	system->prefs->sound?
2008-05-11T15:34:00.000Z	ak5	rutgermasi	I tried looking there - what do you mean?
2008-05-11T15:35:00.000Z	rutgermasi	ak5	Look for "Default mixer"
2008-05-11T15:35:00.000Z	ak5	rutgermasi	set to PCM
2008-05-11T15:35:00.000Z	ak5	rutgermasi	doesn't work though :(
2008-05-11T15:36:00.000Z	rutgermasi	ak5	I haven't a solution, try the ubuntu forums
2008-05-11T15:36:00.000Z	ak5	rutgermasi	I did, but thx!
2008-05-11T15:38:00.000Z	ak5	rutgermasi	lol it does work - it is just increasing/decreasing the volume by incredibly small increments
2008-05-12T00:00:00.000Z	rutgermasi	ak5	won't boot after installation or after loading cd after bios?
2008-05-12T00:00:00.000Z	ak5	rutgermasi	the latter
2008-05-12T00:00:00.000Z	rutgermasi	ak5	my english is bad :P, you mean the second?
2008-05-12T00:00:00.000Z	ak5	rutgermasi	yes
2008-05-12T00:01:00.000Z	rutgermasi	ak5	im not familiar with fluxbuntu, but have you tried the alternate cd?
2008-05-12T00:02:00.000Z	ak5	rutgermasi	haha, your a genious - I automaticly assumed my fluxbox iso was alternate because it's based on fluxbox :)
2008-05-12T00:04:00.000Z	rutgermasi	ak5	according to the site of fluxbuntu, there is also a live cd
2008-05-12T00:04:00.000Z	ak5	rutgermasi	that's the one I have :)
2008-05-12T00:05:00.000Z	rutgermasi	ak5	just install ubuntu, remove ubuntu-desktop and install fluxbuntu-desktop
2008-05-12T00:05:00.000Z	ak5	rutgermasi	gonna try something like that now
