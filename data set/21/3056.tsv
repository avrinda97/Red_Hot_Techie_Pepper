2009-04-17T16:46:00.000Z	cwillu	Welshy-Rob	you found the capture screen?
2009-04-17T16:48:00.000Z	cwillu	Welshy-Rob	ugh, I'm on #ubuntu+1, which has a different ui on vlc :(
2009-04-17T16:49:00.000Z	cwillu	Welshy-Rob	I think you just need to find the source device and change it to X11 or display or something like that
2009-04-17T16:49:00.000Z	cwillu	Welshy-Rob	working from very foggy memory here
2009-04-17T16:52:00.000Z	Welshy-Rob	cwillu	right ok i found it and it works sort of it shows only my vlc like player then tthey just keep appearing and shrinking into the distance like a vanish point if you know what that is
2009-04-17T17:22:00.000Z	Welshy-Rob	cwillu	do you know anything about gtk-recordmydesktop??
2009-04-17T17:23:00.000Z	cwillu	Welshy-Rob	sorry, I'm late for a meeting :(
