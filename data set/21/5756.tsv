2007-08-26T11:05:00.000Z	DJAnubis		hmm
2007-08-26T11:05:00.000Z	DJAnubis		it's not reading it as the CD
2007-08-26T11:06:00.000Z	DJAnubis		I'm trying to get reason to run under wine
2007-08-26T11:06:00.000Z	DJAnubis		and it asks me for my cd, so I have an ISO that I ripped to save time and fumbling
2007-08-26T11:06:00.000Z	DJAnubis		it works in windows, that's all I know
2007-08-26T11:07:00.000Z	DJAnubis		but I also know I don't have daemontools on linux :P
2007-08-26T11:07:00.000Z	dr_Willis	DJAnubis	 nocd 'cracks' are handy. :) if of debateable legalness...
2007-08-26T11:09:00.000Z	dr_Willis	DJAnubis	 is this a cd copy protected game or what exactly?
2007-08-26T11:10:00.000Z	DJAnubis	dr_Willis	 no, it just needs to copy the files from the CD it doesn't need to be all that protected
2007-08-26T11:10:00.000Z	dr_Willis	DJAnubis	 you should be able to mount the iso file then to a directory.
2007-08-26T11:11:00.000Z	dr_Willis	DJAnubis	 this is with wine?
2007-08-26T11:12:00.000Z	dr_Willis	DJAnubis	 theres some wine options on that i recall.. or copy all the files from the cd/iso to a directory then cd to that dir. and run the isntaller..
2007-08-26T11:12:00.000Z	dr_Willis	DJAnubis	 ive seen a few brain dead programs demand cd'd get changed and so forth.
2007-08-26T11:14:00.000Z	dr_Willis	DJAnubis	 there are 2 cd's ?
2007-08-26T11:14:00.000Z	dr_Willis	DJAnubis	 Or do you mean to say there are 2 iso files, of the cd's ?
2007-08-26T11:15:00.000Z	dr_Willis	DJAnubis	 wjat ive done in the past. is copy ALL files from both iso's i mounted. to a single dir. then ran the isntaller from that dir.
2007-08-26T11:15:00.000Z	dr_Willis	DJAnubis	 seen a few games that needed that.
2007-08-26T11:16:00.000Z	dr_Willis	DJAnubis	 rather trivial.. mount one cd.. copy stuff over.. mount 2nd cd.. copy stuff over..  :) cd to the dir.. wine setup.exe or whatever.
2007-08-26T11:16:00.000Z	dr_Willis	DJAnubis	 i recall some games UT2004? needed tobe done that way. the installer would 'lock' the cd. and not let ya change it.
2007-08-26T11:17:00.000Z	dr_Willis	DJAnubis	 ive also copied the installed directory from a windows install to my linux drive to run it with wine.
2007-08-26T11:19:00.000Z	dr_Willis	DJAnubis	 no such thing as deamon tools under linux. since you can just mount a .iso file. guess yacould manually unmount the iso, then mount the other iso, then hit continue on the program..
