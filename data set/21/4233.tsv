2008-06-05T16:00:00.000Z	pengo		any help getting two monitors to work on a laptop running hardy? i can only clone the screens but not extend desktop
2008-06-05T16:00:00.000Z	peitschie	pengo	what kind of graphics card?
2008-06-05T16:00:00.000Z	pengo	peitschie	intel i965
2008-06-05T16:01:00.000Z	peitschie	pengo	hit alt+f2 and type in "gksu displayconfig-gtk"
2008-06-05T16:02:00.000Z	peitschie	pengo	see if it gives you options for multiple monitors there
2008-06-05T16:03:00.000Z	pengo	peitschie	thanks to restart x to check it it looks like
2008-06-05T16:04:00.000Z	pengo	peitschie	ah.. i just tried grandr, which seemed promising but gave the error "user set screen width 2048, larger than max width 1024, set to max width"
2008-06-05T16:05:00.000Z	pengo	peitschie	 i guess x has a maximum buffer size
2008-06-05T16:05:00.000Z	peitschie	pengo	that could be an xrandr issue.  there is an alternative in Xinerama i believe
2008-06-05T16:05:00.000Z	peitschie	pengo	give me a moment to check it out
2008-06-05T16:06:00.000Z	pengo	peitschie	ok i'll just rebooting anyway.. brb
2008-06-05T16:30:00.000Z	pengo	peitschie	still stuck in low graphics mode
2008-06-05T16:23:00.000Z	pengo	peitschie	i can't get up to native 1024x768 on the laptop screen any more
2008-06-05T16:23:00.000Z	peitschie	pengo	is it in failsafe mode?
2008-06-05T16:23:00.000Z	pengo	peitschie	hmm maybe
2008-06-05T16:24:00.000Z	peitschie	pengo	it will prompt you with a silly screen if it is.  What happened on start up?  Was this a restart attempt after trying to activate the external screen?
2008-06-05T16:25:00.000Z	pengo	peitschie	yeah it gave me a silly screen.. i think cause the second monitor was plugged in at boot and that confuses it.. should i just reboot again?

2008-06-05T16:31:00.000Z	peitschie	pengo	i feel your frustration.  so, you're now back on the laptop only screen... can you jack up the resolutoin to the proper one again?
2008-06-05T16:32:00.000Z	pengo	peitschie	just laptop, and i can't
2008-06-05T16:32:00.000Z	peitschie	pengo	whats it do?
