2010-07-28T04:18:00.000Z	pradeep		am using ubuntu 10.04 i installvirtualbox but my usb is greyed on my windows virtual machine
2010-07-28T04:18:00.000Z	pradeep		howdo enable it
2010-07-28T04:19:00.000Z	hylian	pradeep	the only workaround i know is to be root. the best way to do this is to either type gksu VirtualBox, or to make a link with that setup
2010-07-28T04:20:00.000Z	pradeep	hylian	how dont really understand u
2010-07-28T04:20:00.000Z	hylian	pradeep	hold alt, and hit f2. then type gksu VirtualBox. this will start VirtualBox in super user mode.
2010-07-28T04:38:00.000Z	pradeep	hylian	still battling qit it
2010-07-28T04:40:00.000Z	hylian	pradeep	i did fail to manetion that after you run virtualbox in super user mode, you will have to re set up your virtual machines, you can still use the same hard drives, you will just have to re set up the accounts. you will then have usb available
2010-07-28T04:41:00.000Z	pradeep	hylian	 so does it mean anytime i want to run vbox i must gksu?
2010-07-28T04:41:00.000Z	hylian	pradeep	yes and no, if you want usb support yes. i have tried every other work around, and it doesn't work.
2010-07-28T04:42:00.000Z	pradeep	hylian	 hmmmm ok then let me see brb
2010-07-28T04:56:00.000Z	pradeep	hylian	wats up am back
2010-07-28T04:57:00.000Z	hylian	pradeep	did that work?
2010-07-28T04:57:00.000Z	pradeep	hylian	yea it did very well
2010-07-28T04:59:00.000Z	hylian	pradeep	i actually edit the menu item for virtualbox and added the gksu in the front, since i always need usb support to run my windows only scanner
2010-07-28T05:00:00.000Z	pradeep	hylian	 what version of vbox are you using
2010-07-28T05:00:00.000Z	pradeep	hylian	 here is what i did https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/103523
2010-07-28T05:01:00.000Z	hylian	pradeep	did that actually work though? because i got no results.
2010-07-28T05:02:00.000Z	pradeep	hylian	 well it did for me after addin to my /etc/rc.local worked very well
2010-07-28T05:02:00.000Z	hylian	pradeep	good to know. i guess im lazy being su all the time, but i really needed my usb devices.
2010-07-28T05:03:00.000Z	pradeep	hylian	yup
