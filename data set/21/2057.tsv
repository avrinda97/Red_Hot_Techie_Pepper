2010-02-19T12:49:00.000Z	Yerushalmi		Other than wine, are there any other good Windows emulators/compatibility layers out there?
2010-02-19T12:50:00.000Z	indus	Yerushalmi	wine is 'Wine Is Not an Emulator
2010-02-19T12:50:00.000Z	Yerushalmi	indus	That's why I said "compatibility layer" also :p
2010-02-19T12:50:00.000Z	indus	Yerushalmi	crossover i think
2010-02-19T12:50:00.000Z	indus	Yerushalmi	yea noticed that later :)
2010-02-19T12:50:00.000Z	indus	Yerushalmi	qemu is emulator though
2010-02-19T12:51:00.000Z	Yerushalmi	indus	which would you suggest to try first, crossover or qemu?
2010-02-19T12:52:00.000Z	indus	Yerushalmi	i dont have experience in either, but you should try both since one is an emu and one is a compatibility layer thing
2010-02-19T12:53:00.000Z	Yerushalmi	indus	can't find crossover in Ubuntu software center, where is it?
2010-02-19T12:53:00.000Z	indus	Yerushalmi	its not free
2010-02-19T12:54:00.000Z	Yerushalmi	indus	Aha.
2010-02-19T12:54:00.000Z	indus	Yerushalmi	maybe if you tell the channel what you are looking or trying to do,someone might suggest some good things

2010-02-19T12:56:00.000Z	Yerushalmi	indus	Basically, I want to use the NES emulator from my old windows computer. the reason I don't want to use an ubuntu emulator is because I have a save rather far along I don't want to lose.
2010-02-19T12:57:00.000Z	Yerushalmi	indus	The emulator doesn't work great in wine, I was wondering if there was another I could try.
2010-02-19T12:59:00.000Z	indus	Yerushalmi	why
2010-02-19T13:00:00.000Z	Yerushalmi	indus	Not "sad" as in unhappy. Sad as in pathetic. Read my previous sentence. :p
2010-02-19T13:00:00.000Z	indus	Yerushalmi	ok :)
2010-02-19T13:01:00.000Z	Yerushalmi	indus	I mean, you've just been helping me with my question, have you already forgotten? ;)
2010-02-19T13:01:00.000Z	indus	Yerushalmi	no, but i cant advice on this further
2010-02-19T13:02:00.000Z	Yerushalmi	indus	Well, NES emulators and Windows emulators (YIKWINAE) are two different topics, and there was discussion drift. I had already expected it to move into the realm of other people's expertise.
