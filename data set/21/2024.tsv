2010-08-08T15:25:00.000Z	chilli0		Hello , Can I add music to my ipod touch from rythmbox now? ubuntu 10.04 I can see it in rhymbox , and I just deleted all of my old songs off it. ( worked fine) But I tryed adding new ones and it didn't seem to like that...
2010-08-08T15:26:00.000Z	KE1HA	chilli0	check out banshi (not sure on the spelling) but I think it has an iPod-plug in for iTunes etc.
2010-08-08T15:26:00.000Z	chilli0	KE1HA	Ok thanks.
2010-08-08T15:29:00.000Z	KE1HA	chilli0	Just checked, Banshee does have a plug-in for iTune Library: http://code.google.com/p/banshee-itunes-import-plugin/
2010-08-08T15:30:00.000Z	chilli0	KE1HA	It doesn't work =O , ipod doesn't show up on it.
2010-08-08T15:31:00.000Z	KE1HA	chilli0	well that's not good :-) .. I've not used it personally, so don't know all the setup requirements. Did you go though the Apps manager ? Also, there's a site i know for setting these up, hold on, will go look it up.
2010-08-08T15:32:00.000Z	chilli0	KE1HA	Thanks. And yeah I had a look at most of the stuff. But All I need is either something that can add songs.  Or a music player that can play from a folder on the ipod touch.
2010-08-08T15:34:00.000Z	KE1HA	chilli0	Have a read of this one: http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9266
2010-08-08T15:34:00.000Z	chilli0	KE1HA	Will do thanks.
2010-08-08T15:35:00.000Z	chilli0	KE1HA	I dont have windows =P , but gtkpod might work.
2010-08-08T15:36:00.000Z	KE1HA	chilli0	its sounds like it's a mount / umount issue if it's not beeing seen by USB. when you plug it in, cna you go to Places >> and see it listed there ?
2010-08-08T15:36:00.000Z	chilli0	KE1HA	I can see the ipod touch , get into it and everything.
2010-08-08T15:38:00.000Z	KE1HA	chilli0	yes, so it seems, that article has a fair bit of Info, there's a few more I'm looking at now.
2010-08-08T15:39:00.000Z	KE1HA	chilli0	here's another article on 10.04 iPod Support: http://www.downloadsquad.com/2010/02/28/ubuntu-10-04-supports-iphone-and-ipod-touch-out-of-the-box/
2010-08-08T15:39:00.000Z	chilli0	KE1HA	Thanks.
2010-08-08T15:40:00.000Z	KE1HA	chilli0	It says that RythumBox can play them straight form the device.
2010-08-08T15:40:00.000Z	chilli0	KE1HA	I know that. I want to add new music to it.
2010-08-08T15:40:00.000Z	KE1HA	chilli0	check out the Ubuntu-One Music Store
2010-08-08T15:41:00.000Z	chilli0	KE1HA	I have all of my music already.
2010-08-08T15:42:00.000Z	KE1HA	chilli0	Outside of that, im affraid, Im outta ideas for ya.
2010-08-08T15:42:00.000Z	chilli0	KE1HA	Thanks anyway =P
