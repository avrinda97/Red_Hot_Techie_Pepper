2007-01-26T07:22:00.000Z	Thug-N-Me		cedega failed the 3D Acceleration test, how do i enable it ? i have a intel chipset i180
2007-01-26T07:23:00.000Z	shatrat	Thug-N-Me	intel hasn't put out a driver for it with openGL support I guess.
2007-01-26T07:24:00.000Z	Thug-N-Me	shatrat	the opengl test its done with success only 3d acceleration failed
2007-01-26T07:25:00.000Z	shatrat	Thug-N-Me	what do you get for glxinfo | grep rendering? in terminal
2007-01-26T07:25:00.000Z	Thug-N-Me	shatrat	Your video card appears to be using direct hardware rendering.  see ?
2007-01-26T07:25:00.000Z	shatrat	Thug-N-Me	maybe the performance is so low that cedega still wont accept that, might want to poke through their forums. I use wine myself
2007-01-26T07:27:00.000Z	shatrat	Thug-N-Me	as long as you make sure to get one that fits your motherboard slot, I dont think youll regret it.  I upgraded from ati -> nvidia and I love it
2007-01-26T07:27:00.000Z	Thug-N-Me	shatrat	yeah , nvidia rocks
2007-01-26T07:28:00.000Z	Thug-N-Me	shatrat	they are fully supported in linux arent they ?
2007-01-26T07:29:00.000Z	shatrat	Thug-N-Me	I dont know about fully. I know some intel stuff is open source.  Nvidia are still closed source but they are very powerful and come with lots of nie config options and support AIGLX et cetera
2007-02-18T10:42:00.000Z	shatrat	Thug-N-Me	are you trying to use it as a second monitor?
2007-02-18T10:42:00.000Z	Thug-N-Me	shatrat	no
2007-02-18T10:43:00.000Z	shatrat	Thug-N-Me	are you using it as your main monitor?
2007-02-18T10:44:00.000Z	Thug-N-Me	shatrat	i just plug it in only when i want to see some movies ... all other times i use the normal monitor size ;)
2007-02-18T10:45:00.000Z	shatrat	Thug-N-Me	well, I assume no picture is showing up? Youll need to configure it in your xserver.org.  I think using dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg should give you the option of adding a second monitor.
2007-02-18T10:46:00.000Z	Thug-N-Me	shatrat	it does show picture i can use it no .. problem ... its only the mplayer that doesnt want to play movies
2007-02-18T10:47:00.000Z	shatrat	Thug-N-Me	well, mplayer has miles of documentation and its a very command line oriented video player.  You might have to configure it to prefer using that display
2007-02-18T10:47:00.000Z	Thug-N-Me	shatrat	totem works fine ... so i dont think its a xorg conf
2007-02-18T10:49:00.000Z	Thug-N-Me	shatrat	what does the warning on the screen mean " unsupported signal adjust pc output  " ? thats what i see on the  bottom corner while using the sony lcd tv
2007-02-18T10:51:00.000Z	Thug-N-Me	shatrat	i am able to play movies with mplayer using it but only with vo device set to x11/ ximage/Shm  and not full screen mode :(   if i use default x11/xv doesnt work
2007-02-18T10:53:00.000Z	shatrat	Thug-N-Me	sorry I dont know that much about mplayer and I dont run dual monitors myself. Im not sure how to specify the right device.
