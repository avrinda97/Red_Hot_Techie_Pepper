2005-09-11T12:33:00.000Z	dreamie		ok guys
2005-09-11T12:33:00.000Z	dreamie		when i disabled sound in bios then it wouldnt boot
2005-09-11T12:34:00.000Z	dreamie		i think the problem may be the sound card
2005-09-11T12:34:00.000Z	dreamie		maybe its looking for the sound card and its not finding it
2005-09-11T12:34:00.000Z	bob2	dreamie	dmesg would tell you one way or the other
2005-09-11T13:29:00.000Z	bob2	dreamie	which resources?
2005-09-11T14:08:00.000Z	bob2	dreamie	you'd need to define "slow" a lot more strictly
2005-09-12T15:30:00.000Z	bob2	dreamie	perhaps you forgot to install a SMP kernel?
2005-09-12T15:32:00.000Z	dreamie	bob2	it only has 1 cpu
2005-09-12T15:33:00.000Z	bob2	dreamie	so what are you talking about?
2005-09-12T15:34:00.000Z	dreamie	bob2	my laptop is slow on the desktop and i am figuring out why
2005-09-12T15:34:00.000Z	dreamie	bob2	also what i can do about it
2005-09-12T15:34:00.000Z	bob2	dreamie	you haven't defined "slow" yet
2005-09-12T15:37:00.000Z	dreamie	bob2	the screen takes time to go into one program to another....multi tasking is difficult
2005-09-12T15:37:00.000Z	bob2	dreamie	you'd need to provide a list of applications you're using, the output of 'ps aux' and 'free -m', and tell us what cpu and type of disk you have
2005-09-12T15:38:00.000Z	bob2	dreamie	it's not very surprising that gnome is slow then
2005-09-12T15:39:00.000Z	bob2	dreamie	nevermind
2005-09-12T15:39:00.000Z	bob2	dreamie	a p233 is never going to be fun with gnome
2005-09-12T15:41:00.000Z	dreamie	bob2	is there a panel that is not gnome that will be lighter? i switched to fluxbox
2005-09-12T15:41:00.000Z	dreamie	bob2	is there something else i can do?
2005-09-12T15:41:00.000Z	bob2	dreamie	you're using gluxbox?
