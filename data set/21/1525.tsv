2010-08-18T11:26:00.000Z	Rummage		Aye.
2010-08-18T11:27:00.000Z	Rummage		Well, thanks, but it's going to suck if I can't get onto the bloody wifi.
2010-08-18T11:28:00.000Z	Rummage		This is my tower computer.
2010-08-18T11:28:00.000Z	Rummage		On a modem connection.
2010-08-18T11:28:00.000Z	Rummage		On XP.
2010-08-18T11:28:00.000Z	mneptok	Rummage	who makes the wifi chipset in your machine?
2010-08-18T11:29:00.000Z	mneptok	Rummage	laptop or desktop?
2010-08-18T11:30:00.000Z	mneptok	Rummage	embedded, cardbus, PCI-E ...?
2010-08-18T11:31:00.000Z	mneptok	Rummage	is the Realtek embedded or an add-in card of some type?
2010-08-18T11:32:00.000Z	mneptok	Rummage	my laptop came with WiFI, and it's a Mini PCI-E half-height add-in card
2010-08-18T11:41:00.000Z	mneptok	Rummage	and the WAP SSID is *really* "Not-Associated?"
2010-08-18T11:41:00.000Z	Rummage	mneptok	That's what it says.
2010-08-18T11:42:00.000Z	mneptok	Rummage	and you connected to this by using nm-applet to look for available access points?
2010-08-18T11:42:00.000Z	Rummage	mneptok	Whichever one is responsible for our little connection widget on the status bar.
2010-08-18T11:46:00.000Z	mneptok	Rummage	try "nslookup cnn.com" in a terminal
2010-08-18T11:46:00.000Z	Rummage	mneptok	I am not connected in any way on this laptop. . .
2010-08-18T11:47:00.000Z	mneptok	Rummage	then you cannot possibly ping anything.
2010-08-18T11:47:00.000Z	Rummage	mneptok	I am reporting on past attempts. I am not sitting in a library at 2am asking you these questions.
2010-08-18T11:47:00.000Z	mneptok	Rummage	then there's no point in trying to help, as anything we suggest cannot be tested.
2010-08-18T11:48:00.000Z	Rummage	mneptok	You guys are the only ones who've even responded to my queries, and I can test an idea later, and report back. It's a slow process, yes, but it's all I've got.
