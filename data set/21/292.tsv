2012-06-11T15:13:00.000Z	Devilz	fidel	I just installed squid on my ubuntu
2012-06-11T15:13:00.000Z	fidel	Devilz	please talk to the channel and dont focus on me - thanks ;)
2012-06-11T15:13:00.000Z	Devilz		i need to make changes in squid.confi file to set squid according to my need right?
2012-06-11T15:14:00.000Z	Devilz		I am not able to make changes to the squid.confi file?
2012-06-11T15:15:00.000Z	Devilz		It says u dont have the permission :(
2012-06-11T15:15:00.000Z	fidel	Devilz	you might need to use sudo
2012-06-11T15:15:00.000Z	Devilz	fidel	sudo is to install squid right?
2012-06-11T15:15:00.000Z	Devilz		I have succesfully installed squid
2012-06-11T15:15:00.000Z	fidel	Devilz	no
2012-06-11T15:16:00.000Z	Devilz	fidel	then?
2012-06-11T15:17:00.000Z	fidel	Devilz	to be honest - you should try to understand before you blindly execute commands
2012-06-11T15:17:00.000Z	Devilz	fidel	:P i used sudo apt-get install squid
2012-06-11T15:17:00.000Z	fidel	Devilz	so understanding what sudo is & is used for might make sense before youz continue trying to setup squid - but thats just my point of view
2012-06-11T15:17:00.000Z	fidel	Devilz	yep - that installed squid
2012-06-11T15:17:00.000Z	Devilz		yup i used sudo for that only
2012-06-11T15:18:00.000Z	Devilz		i googled about it. to setup squid i need to make changes to the squid.confi file ryt?
2012-06-11T15:18:00.000Z	fidel	Devilz	personaly i would suggest you start with 'man sudo' in terminal to understand sudo ... then use it to edit the permission-protected file
2012-06-11T15:19:00.000Z	fidel	Devilz	then restart the squid-service and check if it works as you think you have it configured
2012-06-11T15:20:00.000Z	Devilz	fidel	ohk but can u tell me what changes i require to make to the squid.confi to keep a wifi router password protected?
