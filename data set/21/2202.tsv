2009-12-15T21:15:00.000Z	sacarlson		hI I got the Ubuntu 9.10 down loaded and burned on a cd.  I don't see the option to live boot off the cd.  does that still work on version 9.10?
2009-12-15T21:15:00.000Z	sacarlson		will it live boot?
2009-12-15T21:16:00.000Z	sacarlson		what line to select will live boot the install?
2009-12-15T21:16:00.000Z	sacarlson		ok thanks airtonix
2009-12-15T21:16:00.000Z	sacarlson		I'll try it
2009-12-15T21:17:00.000Z	joepublic9	sacarlson	You need to set the boot device in bios
2009-12-15T21:17:00.000Z	sacarlson		it boots already I was just afraid it would wipe my hard drive
2009-12-15T21:17:00.000Z	sacarlson		I just want to boot it
2009-12-15T21:18:00.000Z	joepublic9		It won't wipe the drive, just do NOT use "install Ubuntu" option
2009-12-15T21:18:00.000Z	sacarlson		that's the first line in 9.10 Install
2009-12-15T21:19:00.000Z	joepublic9		Yes , if you want to install, but you can use it from the CD, just launch Firefox or whatever you want to test
2009-12-15T21:19:00.000Z	sacarlson		I see no other line that says it will live boot in version 9.10
2009-12-15T21:20:00.000Z	sacarlson		OH ok good enuf then airtronix
2009-12-15T21:20:00.000Z	joepublic9		Thanks airtonix :)
2009-12-15T21:20:00.000Z	sacarlson		here goes
2009-12-15T21:26:00.000Z	sacarlson		seems your wrong about the Ubuntu 9.10 live boot thing when I selected install from boot it went as far as going to the partion disk
2009-12-15T21:26:00.000Z	sacarlson		I stoped it there
2009-12-15T21:26:00.000Z	joepublic9	sacarlson	Did you get to the desktop?
2009-12-15T21:26:00.000Z	sacarlson	joepublic9	no
2009-12-15T21:27:00.000Z	sacarlson	joepublic9	I rebooted to stop the partion of  my hard drives
2009-12-15T21:27:00.000Z	joepublic9	sacarlson	 Strange, I just did a clean install and it worked perfectly, you do a checksum on you cd?
