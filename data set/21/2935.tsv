2011-06-24T19:52:00.000Z	xxiao		i run 'update-grub' and os_probe find a new partition with new ubuntu, grub.cfg is updated, however a reboot always shows the old boot menu?
2011-06-24T19:52:00.000Z	xxiao		why isn't the new updated grub.cfg never shown? is there some cache-saved file ?
2011-06-24T19:53:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	xxiao	do you have more then one GNU/Linux installed on your computer?
2011-06-24T19:53:00.000Z	xxiao	ZykoticK9	i have one on sda1, one on sda7, one on sdb2
2011-06-24T19:54:00.000Z	xxiao	ZykoticK9	it only shows menus on sda1 and sda7
2011-06-24T19:54:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	xxiao	whichever you installed Last is most likely the Grub that is in control - be sure you are running "update-grub2" from the correct install
2011-06-24T19:54:00.000Z	xxiao	ZykoticK9	but...it's grub 1.99+ so i run update-grub instead of update-grub2
2011-06-24T19:55:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	xxiao	actually 1.99 is infact Grub2
2011-06-24T19:55:00.000Z	xxiao	ZykoticK9	are you saying i should run update-grub2 after i made those changes?
2011-06-24T19:55:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	xxiao	you need to run update-grub after ANY changes to /etc/default/grub
2011-06-24T19:55:00.000Z	xxiao	ZykoticK9	yes i did that
2011-06-24T19:55:00.000Z	xxiao	ZykoticK9	i also compared the new grub.cfg, the os_prober does find my sdb2 ubuntu
2011-06-24T19:56:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	xxiao	so - are you running this from your most currently installed gnu/linux?
2011-06-24T19:56:00.000Z	xxiao	ZykoticK9	yes
2011-06-24T19:56:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	xxiao	then i can't explain what's happening.  Best of luck!
2011-06-24T19:56:00.000Z	xxiao	ZykoticK9	thanks
2011-06-24T22:46:00.000Z	xxiao	ZykoticK9	r u still here
2011-06-24T22:46:00.000Z	xxiao	ZykoticK9	i 'fixed' the grub problem,
2011-06-24T22:47:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	xxiao	how did you fix it?
2011-06-24T22:47:00.000Z	xxiao	ZykoticK9	natty used its 1.99 grub which caused all thesee trouble, i force installed the lucid grub and now it works
