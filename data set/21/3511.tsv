2008-12-18T05:17:00.000Z	jrib	israelito_solito	umm, can you give more context as to what you are trying to do?
2008-12-18T05:18:00.000Z	israelito_solito	jrib	the sound of my laptop died out yesterday
2008-12-18T05:18:00.000Z	jrib	israelito_solito	so the sound worked at first after installing ubuntu?
2008-12-18T05:22:00.000Z	jrib	israelito_solito	so you can still hear sound, it is just really low?
2008-12-18T05:22:00.000Z	israelito_solito	jrib	i was watching a video on google with no problem, then left it downloading
2008-12-18T05:23:00.000Z	israelito_solito	jrib	then it just faded out some, and after rebooting it-s almost mute
2008-12-18T05:23:00.000Z	jrib	israelito_solito	so you can still hear sound, it is just really low?
2008-12-18T05:23:00.000Z	israelito_solito	jrib	yes, its very very low
2008-12-18T05:24:00.000Z	jrib	israelito_solito	double click on the speaker icon and check Master and PCM levels
2008-12-18T05:25:00.000Z	israelito_solito	jrib	ha ha, i failed to see the icon!
2008-12-18T05:25:00.000Z	israelito_solito	jrib	muchas gracias!
2008-12-18T05:26:00.000Z	jrib	israelito_solito	de nada
2008-12-18T05:37:00.000Z	israelito_solito	jrib	are you still there?
2008-12-18T05:38:00.000Z	jrib	israelito_solito	yes
2008-12-18T05:39:00.000Z	israelito_solito	jrib	ok. the reason I want to install the driver for my video card is because about 10 to 20 minutes of watching any video, it gets slow, like when there-s not enought ram memory left or something like that
2008-12-18T05:39:00.000Z	jrib	israelito_solito	what card?
2008-12-18T05:40:00.000Z	israelito_solito	jrib	ATI Radeon Xpress 200
2008-12-18T05:49:00.000Z	israelito_solito	jrib	where's the restricted-manager?
2008-12-18T05:49:00.000Z	jrib	israelito_solito	system -> administration -> hardware
