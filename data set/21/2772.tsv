2009-06-30T08:37:00.000Z	Hylian		didnt know that. i have to admit, i havent been a++ cert since 1993. im an old dude
2009-06-30T08:38:00.000Z	Hylian		init: rc-default main process terminated with status 225?
2009-06-30T08:40:00.000Z	Hylian		look, there is nothing wrong with calling someone a noob or newbie, it's one of those used to be bad words like geek. i now where that tag with honor. i am a noob to linux.
2009-06-30T08:41:00.000Z	Hylian		by the way, i know this is ot, but ubuntu is the best os i have ever had.
2009-06-30T08:42:00.000Z	Hylian		thanks ctmjr, so what your telling me is most .run installer's have a uninstall script somewhere?
2009-06-30T08:43:00.000Z	Hylian		im personally not switchin to 9.04. 8.04 is running too well to mess with it.
2009-06-30T08:45:00.000Z	Hylian		root@denny-desktop:/usr/local/games/enemy-territory# sh uninstall.run
2009-06-30T08:45:00.000Z	Hylian		sh: Can't open uninstall.run
2009-06-30T08:45:00.000Z	Hylian		it isnt visible, so either uninstall.run isnt there, or is invisible
2009-06-30T08:47:00.000Z	Hylian		it's no big deal dude, if i cant uninstall it, i will just remove it from the menu bar. but i would like to free that 256 mb
2009-06-30T08:47:00.000Z	raylu	Hylian	do you know where it installed to?
2009-06-30T08:50:00.000Z	raylu	Hylian	i'd suggest just removing those
2009-06-30T08:50:00.000Z	raylu	Hylian	rm -r :D
2009-06-30T08:50:00.000Z	raylu	Hylian	yes
2009-06-30T08:51:00.000Z	raylu	Hylian	and the link in /usr/local/bin
2009-06-30T08:51:00.000Z	raylu	Hylian	no, you can't remove the directory you're currently in. sudo rm -r /usr/local/games/enemy-territory
2009-06-30T08:54:00.000Z	raylu	Hylian	which bin folder?
2009-06-30T08:55:00.000Z	raylu	Hylian	yes, just remove the enemy territory files in that directory
2009-06-30T08:55:00.000Z	raylu	Hylian	yep.
2009-06-30T08:55:00.000Z	Hylian	raylu	yeah man you a great help, im a old windows war horse. linux is a steep but enjoyable learning curve
2009-06-30T08:57:00.000Z	raylu	Hylian	i beg to differ, but if i do, people will tell me i'm off-topic again
