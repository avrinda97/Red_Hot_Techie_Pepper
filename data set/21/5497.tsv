2009-02-14T00:35:00.000Z	MikeonTV	Jack_Sparrow	it is not happy that I have no Root system asigned. I will have to assign ti to the Ubuntu partition
2009-02-14T00:37:00.000Z	MikeonTV	Jack_Sparrow	it is not happy that I have no Root system asigned. I will have to assign ti to the Ubuntu partition
2009-02-14T00:38:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	MikeonTV	that is standard.. correct, but a sep one for /home is even better
2009-02-14T00:38:00.000Z	MikeonTV	Jack_Sparrow	so I will have two ubuntu partitions?
2009-02-14T00:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	MikeonTV	one / aka root   and one /home  yes
2009-02-14T00:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	MikeonTV	during the ionstall you tell it / is one partition   /home is another and swap..
2009-02-14T00:41:00.000Z	MikeonTV	Jack_Sparrow	so how big do I make the /home parition and how big do I make the / partition?
2009-02-14T00:42:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	MikeonTV	if you have 60 to work with go 20 for root 40 for home minus your swap
