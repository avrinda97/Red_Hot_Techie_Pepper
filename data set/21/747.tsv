2011-07-28T08:00:00.000Z	NickNakz		can anyone suggest the easiest VM application for Ubuntu.. to setup?
2011-07-28T08:01:00.000Z	NickNakz		lemme check virtual box for a sec
2011-07-28T08:01:00.000Z	abstrakt	NickNakz	yeah, i would vote for VirtualBox by sun
2011-07-28T08:01:00.000Z	NickNakz		i was checking one out the other day
2011-07-28T08:01:00.000Z	NickNakz		brb
2011-07-28T08:02:00.000Z	abstrakt	NickNakz	there's also KVM if you know what you're doing
2011-07-28T08:02:00.000Z	NickNakz	abstrakt	 cool... ok, that's what i started with.  think i missed the step to install OS in the VM
2011-07-28T08:05:00.000Z	abstrakt	NickNakz	you just have to boot the OS
2011-07-28T08:05:00.000Z	abstrakt	NickNakz	like most OSes it will look for a drive with an OS, usually floppy then CD then HDD
2011-07-28T08:05:00.000Z	NickNakz	abstrakt	 i deleted the test one i was trying before.  going to do it again now.
2011-07-28T08:05:00.000Z	abstrakt	NickNakz	just add a new virtual CD drive and load in the ISO image of whatever OS you downloaded
2011-07-28T08:06:00.000Z	abstrakt	NickNakz	then when you boot for the first time, it should check the "CD Drive" first, and if you have e.g. ubuntu-10.10.iso in there
2011-07-28T08:06:00.000Z	NickNakz	abstrakt	 ok, i do have the boot disk... and that's what i missed
2011-07-28T08:06:00.000Z	abstrakt		it'll just run it
2011-07-28T08:06:00.000Z	NickNakz	abstrakt	 will i always need the boot disk to use the VM?  or does it install in there the 1st time?
2011-07-28T08:07:00.000Z	abstrakt	NickNakz	have you ever installed ubuntu from a CD?
2011-07-28T08:07:00.000Z	abstrakt	NickNakz	it's a "virtual computer"... it works just like any other computer otherwise would
2011-07-28T08:07:00.000Z	NickNakz	abstrakt	 yup yup.  installed from disk
2011-07-28T08:07:00.000Z	abstrakt	NickNakz	it has a hard drive, cd drive, etc, so yes, it installs and works just like any other OS
2011-07-28T08:07:00.000Z	abstrakt		but the hard drive and disk drive obviously are "virtual" and may or may not correspond to the real HDD or CDR on your actual physicial system
2011-07-28T08:08:00.000Z	NickNakz	abstrakt	 ok, got it now.
