2010-09-11T02:29:00.000Z	newkno		Hi.  Is it still possible to install within Windoze?
2010-09-11T02:30:00.000Z	newkno		It's not that simple, aeon-ltd.
2010-09-11T02:31:00.000Z	newkno		I plan to use VB eventually.
2010-09-11T02:31:00.000Z	newkno		First, though I have a problem.  So I just want to install a Linux f.s. within an NTFS one.
2010-09-11T02:31:00.000Z	newkno		virtualbox
2010-09-11T02:32:00.000Z	newkno		I can refer you to something I posted that explains things better than i can do here.
2010-09-11T02:32:00.000Z	uRock	newkno	installing vbox, then installing ubuntu within is very easy
2010-09-11T02:32:00.000Z	newkno		just a moment...
2010-09-11T02:32:00.000Z	uRock		you can't go wrong
2010-09-11T02:32:00.000Z	newkno		Yes  And I want to know how to do those things.
2010-09-11T02:32:00.000Z	newkno		First, though, just for my own reasons, I want to install Ubuntu within Windoze.
2010-09-11T02:32:00.000Z	uRock		rtm
2010-09-11T02:33:00.000Z	newkno		I can't figure out how to do it.
2010-09-11T02:33:00.000Z	newkno		The online docs are outdated.
2010-09-11T02:33:00.000Z	uRock		!manual
2010-09-11T02:33:00.000Z	uRock		is up to date
2010-09-11T02:34:00.000Z	newkno		<aeon-ltd> - you mean it used to be possible to install Ubuntu within Windoze, but no longer is?
2010-09-11T02:34:00.000Z	newkno		That's what the evidence is suggesting to me.
2010-09-11T02:34:00.000Z	uRock	newkno	you either have to use wubi or VBox
2010-09-11T02:34:00.000Z	uRock		or VM
2010-09-11T02:35:00.000Z	newkno	uRock	- I used wubi, but it doesn't have the option illustrated in the docs I was referred to by someone else.
