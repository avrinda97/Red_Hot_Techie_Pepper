2011-05-30T05:35:00.000Z	clarkm		My box drops to grub on boot. For some reason I set it up to boot from some lvm configuration a while ago, but upgrading distros seems to hvae broken it. I've booted knoppix, but now I'm  at a loss on what to do. Is there some type of automatic reconfiguration tool?
2011-05-30T05:35:00.000Z	clarkm		to clarify, i have one physical volume that contains one volume group. And I want to boot from it
2011-05-30T05:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	clarkm	Is the shell you get at boot a "grub> " prompt or a "rescue> " prompt?
2011-05-30T05:36:00.000Z	clarkm	Jordan_U	It's a grub> prompt
2011-05-30T05:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	clarkm	Do you see any error message?
2011-05-30T05:38:00.000Z	clarkm	Jordan_U	no, it just drops to grub with no complaints
2011-05-30T05:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	clarkm	Could you run boot info script as explained here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1291280 and pastebin the RESULTS.txt?
2011-05-30T05:54:00.000Z	clarkm	Jordan_U	Here's the output of the bootinfo script http://privatepaste.com/1070d1e642 and here's the output of all the lvm diag commands I could think of http://privatepaste.com/829402f98d
2011-05-30T05:55:00.000Z	clarkm	Jordan_U	the sda1 and sdb1 drives are connected via sata and I'm just using them as storage. I want to boot from the sdc drive
2011-05-30T05:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	clarkm	Please install 'unlzma' and re-run boot info script.
2011-05-30T05:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	clarkm	It would be easier if you booted from an Ubuntu LiveCD.
2011-05-30T05:58:00.000Z	clarkm	Jordan_U	I'll boot from the ubuntu liveCD and re-run it
2011-05-30T05:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	clarkm	I'm going to be away for about an hour.
2011-05-30T06:03:00.000Z	clarkm	Jordan_U	should I PM you the link, or should I just post it in the channel when it's done?
2011-05-30T06:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	clarkm	Just post it in-channel when it's done. That '>' prompt means that you forgot to close a quote and it's waiting for the rest of a multi line quote.
2011-05-30T07:06:00.000Z	clarkm	Jordan_U	here's the paste of bootinfoscript http://privatepaste.com/47fdae127c though, it still complains about unlzma even though it's installed on the ubuntu livecd
2011-05-30T07:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	clarkm	It looks like you don't have any grub.cfg at all. How did you install Ubuntu? Is this a fresh install?
2011-05-30T07:38:00.000Z	clarkm	Jordan_U	no, I just ssh'd in and did a do-release-upgrade and then it didn't boot anymore.
2011-05-30T07:39:00.000Z	clarkm	Jordan_U	I just mounted the partition myself and did a new grub-install, so i'll see where that gets me
2011-05-30T07:44:00.000Z	clarkm	Jordan_U	so I guess at this point I'm looking for a way to reinstall grub on an lvm (with a separate /boot partition)... from a live cd. I haven't found a guide that combines all three of those elements, and I'm pretty hesitant to try anything drastic myself.
2011-05-30T08:28:00.000Z	clarkm	Jordan_U	I got it fixed. :) Took a lot of manual configuration, but I just needed a quick fix to bootstrap it up
