2008-01-04T13:31:00.000Z	eckesicle		Hello all. I have a slight problem. Some douchebag issued a move command with an empty variable and a * in it...
2008-01-04T13:31:00.000Z	eckesicle		meaning most of the system has been moved to
2008-01-04T13:31:00.000Z	eckesicle		 /some/path/
2008-01-04T13:31:00.000Z	scguy318	eckesicle	so mv -R /some/path /old/location?
2008-01-04T13:32:00.000Z	eckesicle	scguy318	yeah well mv: command not found
2008-01-04T13:32:00.000Z	scguy318	eckesicle	/some/path/bin/mv ...
2008-01-04T13:32:00.000Z	eckesicle	scguy318	and /some/path/bin/mv doesn't work either.
2008-01-04T13:33:00.000Z	scguy318	eckesicle	so where was it moved?
2008-01-04T13:34:00.000Z	scguy318	eckesicle	what from where to where?
2008-01-04T13:35:00.000Z	scguy318	eckesicle	so /path/bin/mv doesn't work?
2008-01-04T13:36:00.000Z	scguy318	eckesicle	is mv inside it? and is the path your cwd?
2008-01-04T13:36:00.000Z	scguy318	eckesicle	./mv ...?
2008-01-04T13:37:00.000Z	eckesicle	scguy318	tried and doesn't work
2008-01-04T13:38:00.000Z	scguy318	eckesicle	ok, um, er, dunno chroot, however silly that might be
2008-01-04T13:38:00.000Z	scguy318	eckesicle	or perform the move from outside the system I guess
2008-01-04T13:41:00.000Z	scguy318	eckesicle	I wish I could help further, I'm out of ideas :(
2008-01-04T13:43:00.000Z	eckesicle	scguy318	thx anyways
