2011-08-04T13:27:00.000Z	allandee		I installed 11.04 yesterday, and it's running fine except that switching windows has a delay, in the default UI. any tips?
2011-08-04T13:29:00.000Z	allandee		oh, ok, you've been there then
2011-08-04T13:30:00.000Z	allandee		in order for it to be interpreted as a command
2011-08-04T13:31:00.000Z	allandee		ben64: set ttl to 0 if you control the domain
2011-08-04T13:31:00.000Z	Ben64	allandee	yeah but that won't work till it updates in the first place, which could take 24 hrs
2011-08-04T13:32:00.000Z	allandee		ben64: out of luck, then
2011-08-04T13:32:00.000Z	Ben64		but i have bind : /
2011-08-04T13:32:00.000Z	allandee		ben64: unless you take over the root servers ;p
2011-08-04T13:32:00.000Z	Ben64		can't my bind pretend to be the main server
2011-08-04T13:33:00.000Z	allandee		ben64: it would have to pretend to be the root server then, and I don't think anyone would believe it
2011-08-04T13:33:00.000Z	allandee		(one of the root-servers, rather)
2011-08-04T13:33:00.000Z	Ben64		all i care about is my phone believing it
2011-08-04T13:33:00.000Z	allandee		that's easier!
2011-08-04T13:34:00.000Z	Ben64		i would just modify /etc/hosts, but my phone is still locked down
2011-08-04T13:34:00.000Z	allandee		set your phone's dns server to be your box
2011-08-04T13:34:00.000Z	Ben64		did that
2011-08-04T13:34:00.000Z	allandee		(if it has an official ip)
2011-08-04T13:34:00.000Z	allandee		ok, can your box resolve official names?
2011-08-04T13:35:00.000Z	Ben64	allandee	yeah it resolves everything fine
2011-08-04T13:36:00.000Z	allandee	Ben64	just to be sure, try "dig @<your-dns-ip> google.com" and "dig @<your-dns-ip> your-cool-domain"
2011-08-04T13:36:00.000Z	allandee	Ben64	from outside of your network
