2011-04-01T01:32:00.000Z	pyghassen2		hey guys what if someday someone type ifconfig and you only found "lo" no eth at all!!!
2011-04-01T01:32:00.000Z	meganerdca	pyghassen2	try "ip addr" instead
2011-04-01T01:36:00.000Z	pyghassen2	meganerdca	I got something from the  ip addr command
2011-04-01T01:37:00.000Z	meganerdca	pyghassen2	of course you did :)
2011-04-01T01:37:00.000Z	meganerdca	pyghassen2	if an interface is marked as down, it might not show in ifconfig, ip addr will show state so all current interfaces should be there
2011-04-01T01:37:00.000Z	pyghassen2	meganerdca	there is eth3
2011-04-01T01:38:00.000Z	meganerdca	pyghassen2	plus, someday ifconfig is going away, ip addr was supposed to replace it years ago
2011-04-01T01:38:00.000Z	meganerdca	pyghassen2	OK, does it have an IP?
2011-04-01T01:38:00.000Z	pyghassen2	meganerdca	sp should I just ifconfig eth3 up, and everything will be ok?
2011-04-01T01:40:00.000Z	meganerdca	pyghassen2	"sudo ip link set eth3 up"
2011-04-01T01:41:00.000Z	meganerdca	pyghassen2	if you have DHCP, then you will also need to do "sudo dhclient eth3"
2011-04-01T01:43:00.000Z	pyghassen2	meganerdca	thanks :)
2011-04-01T01:43:00.000Z	meganerdca	pyghassen2	np, networking is something I do for fun... yes I have a problem
2011-04-01T01:45:00.000Z	pyghassen2	meganerdca	I envy you I always wanna know about networking, but unfortunately I only know few
2011-04-01T01:45:00.000Z	meganerdca	pyghassen2	it is not that hard, I was just lucky to have a lot of free time before I met my wife :)
2011-04-01T01:46:00.000Z	meganerdca	pyghassen2	lartc.org is a great place to go if you have lots of time
2011-04-01T01:47:00.000Z	pyghassen2	meganerdca	looooooooool your woman is consuming all your free time now, well that's what i tryna do myself, (avoiding marriage) :P
2011-04-01T01:50:00.000Z	pyghassen2	meganerdca	what is it?
2011-04-01T01:50:00.000Z	meganerdca	pyghassen2	lucky for me she is a nurse who works shift work, I still get lots of time to myself
2011-04-01T01:50:00.000Z	meganerdca	pyghassen2	lartc.org is the Linux Advanced Routing and Traffic Control web site.  Hella fun if you ask me
2011-04-01T01:51:00.000Z	pyghassen2	meganerdca	good advice so i'll just marry a nurse myself ;)
