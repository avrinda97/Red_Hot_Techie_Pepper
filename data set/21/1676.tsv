2010-06-03T08:08:00.000Z	Fixmypc956		well I installed gdesklets from synaptic manager and when i try to start it nothing happens
2010-06-03T08:09:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Fixmypc956	same here as well. must be bugged
2010-06-03T08:10:00.000Z	Fixmypc956	onetinsoldier	u had the same problem?
2010-06-03T08:11:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Fixmypc956	yes. i just tried after i saw your message. i decided to try it out. no dice here either
2010-06-03T08:12:00.000Z	Fixmypc956	onetinsoldier	I completely removed the pkg and reinstalled thinking maybe something went wrong, but got the same outcome after reinstall
2010-06-03T08:13:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Fixmypc956	roger. probably nothing we've done wrong. i think they're just bugged at this time
2010-06-03T08:14:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Fixmypc956	i'm guessing, but i bet if i went to look at the bug report page for the package, it's been reported
2010-06-03T08:16:00.000Z	Fixmypc956	onetinsoldier	well i hope it has maybe I can get it soon
2010-06-03T08:17:00.000Z	Fixmypc956	onetinsoldier	i dont know if what i am getting from synaptic is the same version as what is on the gdesklet site
2010-06-03T08:19:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Fixmypc956	well if your looking at version on the website/homepage of a piece of software that's a package that's in Lucid, i wouldn't be surprised if there's a new version available as 'source'. what's the link?
2010-06-03T08:20:00.000Z	Fixmypc956	onetinsoldier	let me get it for u
2010-06-03T08:21:00.000Z	Fixmypc956	onetinsoldier	http://www.gdesklets.de/
2010-06-03T08:23:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Fixmypc956	thanks. no newer version there. there hasn't been a newer upstream version in a year and a half. we've got the same version as listed on that site
2010-06-03T08:24:00.000Z	Fixmypc956	onetinsoldier	guess we have no luck huh?
2010-06-03T08:25:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Fixmypc956	nope. not at this time anyway
2010-06-03T08:27:00.000Z	Fixmypc956	onetinsoldier	do you know of any other widgets pkg that i can use
2010-06-03T08:27:00.000Z	Fixmypc956	onetinsoldier	Im really looking for something that had a dock, a clock, and some system information
2010-06-03T08:27:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Fixmypc956	google-gadgets maybe
