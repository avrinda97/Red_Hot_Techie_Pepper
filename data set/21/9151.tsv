2005-11-27T16:17:00.000Z	Grock		is there a way to install files using the web instead of apt-get install but end up with the same file?
2005-11-27T16:17:00.000Z	LjL	Grock	what do you mean "using the web"?
2005-11-27T16:17:00.000Z	Grock		firefox for example
2005-11-27T16:18:00.000Z	Grock		well for the case where i don't want to apt-get update but I just want one program?
2005-11-27T16:19:00.000Z	Grock		i've seen it for debian
2005-11-27T16:19:00.000Z	LjL	Grock	if you want one program, you "apt-get install <program>" (or "aptitude install <program>", which i would say is better) -- i don't understand you either
2005-11-27T16:19:00.000Z	Grock		online access for the tarballs that I could manually compile the same sources that apt-get would grab.
2005-11-27T16:20:00.000Z	Grock		for a live session
2005-11-27T16:20:00.000Z	LjL	Grock	if you actually want to *compile* the stuff, just "apt-get source <program>" and you'll have the sources in your current directory
2005-11-27T16:21:00.000Z	Grock		burner but there is a source specific to ubuntu somewhere that apt-get grabs, all i'm asking is if I can use firefox to download the source instead of apt-get.
2005-11-27T16:22:00.000Z	LjL	Grock	yes, you can. but what does this have to do with compiling from source? anyway, of course you can use firefox, just look at the repository's URL, and give it to Firefox
2005-11-27T16:25:00.000Z	Grock	LjL	excactly what i'm after the web address of the repository
2005-11-27T16:26:00.000Z	Grock	LjL	I cant find it anywhere
2005-11-27T16:26:00.000Z	LjL	Grock	look in /etc/apt/sources.list - and then, for the exact subdirectory of a single package, "apt-cache show <package>" will show you
2005-11-27T16:26:00.000Z	Grock		could you paste it for me
2005-11-27T16:26:00.000Z	Grock		my /etc/apt/sources.list is hosed
2005-11-27T16:27:00.000Z	LjL		!tell Grock about sources
2005-11-27T16:29:00.000Z	Grock		again I have to ask how to access the ubuntu repository search it and download with firefox new applications
2005-11-27T16:31:00.000Z	Grock		so when apt-get install doesn't work can i use firefox to get stuff from the repositories?
2005-11-27T16:32:00.000Z	LjL	Grock	yes, and then you can install it using "dpkg -i <filename.deb>". i don't quite see why you *should* do this, but anyway
2005-11-27T16:32:00.000Z	LjL	Grock	keep in mind, though, that many packages have dependencies, i.e. they need other packages to work -- so, often, downloading just *the* package you want is not enough!
