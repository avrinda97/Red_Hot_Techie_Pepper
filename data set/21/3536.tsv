2008-12-20T20:17:00.000Z	Knoobie		Ok, update is going to take forever. I really, really confused xD.
2008-12-20T20:17:00.000Z	Knoobie		6h 45m remaining.
2008-12-20T20:18:00.000Z	Knoobie		I did the Mirror thing.
2008-12-20T20:19:00.000Z	Knoobie		This is annoying. I like Ubuntu, but I wish it would download as quick as Vista does.
2008-12-20T20:20:00.000Z	Knoobie		I know it sounds odd, but it's true.
2008-12-20T20:20:00.000Z	tiyowan	Knoobie	Well...if you're going to measure the worth of an OS according to its download speed, then.
2008-12-20T20:21:00.000Z	tiyowan	Knoobie	However, I doubt you'll understand this...but the Vista TCP/IP stack is horrible.
2008-12-20T20:26:00.000Z	tiyowan	Knoobie	"sudo ufw status" - Is it enabled?
2008-12-20T20:28:00.000Z	tiyowan	Knoobie	No dear. Go to a terminal and type that to find out whether your firewall is enabled.
2008-12-20T20:29:00.000Z	tiyowan	Knoobie	Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal
2008-12-20T20:30:00.000Z	tiyowan	Knoobie	There you go.
2008-12-20T20:32:00.000Z	tiyowan	Knoobie	System -> Admin. -> Software Sources.
2008-12-20T20:33:00.000Z	tiyowan	Knoobie	Sometimes the repo servers get congested. But do pick one near you.
2008-12-20T20:37:00.000Z	tiyowan	Knoobie	You just installed? Which version, intrepid?
2008-12-20T20:40:00.000Z	tiyowan	Knoobie	Yes. :)
2008-12-21T14:20:00.000Z	tiyowan	Knoobie	I don't see why not...can you mount that partition?
2008-12-21T14:53:00.000Z	tiyowan	Knoobie	Security risk.
2008-12-21T14:54:00.000Z	tiyowan	Knoobie	Type "sudo apt-get install wine"
2008-12-21T14:55:00.000Z	tiyowan	Knoobie	Close all other terminal windows and GUI synaptic, etc.
2008-12-21T14:56:00.000Z	tiyowan	Knoobie	Let the poor manager finish its job. :)
2008-12-21T14:57:00.000Z	tiyowan	Knoobie	There's no need to apologize. :) We all learn.
