2010-08-24T00:05:00.000Z	xiong		Are there *any* tools that make working with the command line or filesystem more "friendly"?
2010-08-24T00:06:00.000Z	xiong		I don't say, yet more *powerful* tools.
2010-08-24T00:06:00.000Z	smw	xiong	what type of work with the filesystem?
2010-08-24T00:07:00.000Z	smw	xiong	I am not sure how screen makes things easier. It is very useful though
2010-08-24T00:07:00.000Z	xiong	smw	I would like to add and make use of metadata.
2010-08-24T00:07:00.000Z	smw	xiong	never used it, but this might help. http://www.midnight-commander.org/
2010-08-24T00:08:00.000Z	smw	xiong	ok
2010-08-24T00:10:00.000Z	xiong	smw	I hope it comes clear, the connection between file metadata and command line friendliness. I might tag several files 'foo', then supply '-tag=foo' instead of a shell path with wildcards.
2010-08-24T00:10:00.000Z	smw	xiong	I have never worked with file metadata
2010-08-24T00:11:00.000Z	smw	xiong	part of the issue is everyone has come up with a system of adding metadata
2010-08-24T00:11:00.000Z	xiong	smw	Well, aside from the native metadata -- mtime and so forth -- I have seen nothing.
2010-08-24T00:11:00.000Z	smw	xiong	exactly
2010-08-24T00:12:00.000Z	smw	xiong	are you using a special filesystem that has support for metadata?
2010-08-24T00:12:00.000Z	xiong	smw	I'm not.
2010-08-24T00:12:00.000Z	smw	xiong	then how does it work? I did not think extx did that
2010-08-24T00:13:00.000Z	xiong	smw	I'm looking for solutions. I don't know what they are.
2010-08-24T00:14:00.000Z	smw	xiong	in that case step back. I believe you first need to use a different fs that supports metadata
2010-08-24T00:14:00.000Z	xiong	smw	There are dozens, maybe hundreds of shell commands. I limit this to stuff intended for the command line that does a certain thing and exits; I draw the line at plain invocation of a interactive application.
2010-08-24T00:15:00.000Z	smw	xiong	what are you talking about?
2010-08-24T00:16:00.000Z	xiong	smw	Um, what kind of explanation should I make? I just said that there are a large number of shell commands.
2010-08-24T00:17:00.000Z	xiong	smw	Where did I get confusing?
