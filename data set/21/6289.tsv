2008-01-17T05:24:00.000Z	neverblue	Itaku	then let it finish, and find out just how long it will take :)
2008-02-07T23:08:00.000Z	neverblue	Itaku	did you try 'alsamixer', its a terminal command ?
2008-02-07T23:09:00.000Z	neverblue	Itaku	check with that, make sure the volume is turned up/un-mute
2008-02-07T23:10:00.000Z	Itaku	neverblue	i dont know what my sound cord is though
2008-02-07T23:10:00.000Z	neverblue	Itaku	use alsamixer
2008-02-07T23:11:00.000Z	Itaku	neverblue	i dont know which one my speakers are
2008-02-07T23:11:00.000Z	neverblue	Itaku	try each of them then

2008-02-07T23:12:00.000Z	Itaku	neverblue	it does
2008-02-07T23:12:00.000Z	neverblue	Itaku	then change settings in alsamixer should fix your issues
2008-02-07T23:12:00.000Z	Itaku	neverblue	i dont know which one my speakers are
2008-02-07T23:13:00.000Z	neverblue	Itaku	as I said before, try all the settings
