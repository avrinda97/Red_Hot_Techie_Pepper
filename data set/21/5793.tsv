2007-12-10T00:16:00.000Z	crypt		Well, for whatever reason, everytime I attempt to install it, it says there is a conflict with something already installed
2007-12-10T00:16:00.000Z	crypt		but all i've done was install 7.10, without adding anything seperate
2007-12-10T00:17:00.000Z	wols	crypt	apt-cache policy wine   and apt-get install wine. output of both please
2007-12-10T00:18:00.000Z	crypt	wols	where should i provide you with the output?
2007-12-10T00:19:00.000Z	crypt	wols	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/47580/
2007-12-10T00:22:00.000Z	wols	crypt	you need to be root to isntall stuff and budgetdedicated is not ubuntu. ask the wine folks what they did wrong in their package
2007-12-10T00:22:00.000Z	wols	crypt	wrong md5 since adobe updated it
2007-12-10T00:22:00.000Z	wols	crypt	for gutsy
2007-12-10T00:27:00.000Z	wols	crypt	doesn't matter. your WINE which you try to isntall is not from any ubuntu repo. ask WINE forlks, it's their package
2007-12-10T00:27:00.000Z	crypt	wols	unfortunately i went there first
2007-12-10T00:33:00.000Z	wols	crypt	your sources.list is broken: http://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search_packages.pl?keywords=libaudio2&searchon=names&subword=1&version=gutsy&release=all
2007-12-10T00:36:00.000Z	crypt	wols	that appears to have fixed the problem thanks !
2007-12-10T00:42:00.000Z	wols	crypt	what ati card is it?

2007-12-10T00:48:00.000Z	crypt	wols	Raedon 9600
2007-12-10T00:48:00.000Z	wols	crypt	and I told you before your sources.list is broken. you will have TONS of problems until you fix that
2007-12-10T00:49:00.000Z	crypt	wols	how do i go about correcting that?
2007-12-10T00:49:00.000Z	wols	crypt	by editing your sources.list
2007-12-10T00:49:00.000Z	wols	crypt	things are commented out when they shouldn't be. most probably the main repo
2007-12-10T00:49:00.000Z	crypt	wols	and where do i go to edit that and what do i edit?
