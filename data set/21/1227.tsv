2010-12-24T11:56:00.000Z	Eduard		Hello guys
2010-12-24T11:57:00.000Z	Eduard		Could someone tell me, is it normal, that my CRT monitors screen shape is way off normal bounds, every time i restart computer?
2010-12-24T11:58:00.000Z	Eduard		On Win XP I did not encounter such problems, on 10.10 with nvidia drivers such crap happens
2010-12-24T11:59:00.000Z	rigved	Eduard	not that i know much about it but have you updated the nvidia drivers?
2010-12-24T12:00:00.000Z	Eduard	rigved	my nvidia drivers are of the latest version, i did not install them through Additional drivers, i installed them through nvidia installer
2010-12-24T12:00:00.000Z	rigved	Eduard	you mean from the NVIDIA website
2010-12-24T12:01:00.000Z	rigved	Eduard	there is a reason that the default NVIDIA drivers are not the latest from NVIDIA. because the lates NVIDIA drivers are unstable
2010-12-24T12:01:00.000Z	rigved	Eduard	you should only install what is available in the repositoris
2010-12-24T12:02:00.000Z	Eduard	rigved	i needed nvidia-96 drivers, the ones in repo's didin't work for me
2010-12-24T12:04:00.000Z	rigved	Eduard	what problem do you have with the NVIDIA drivers from the repositories?
2010-12-24T12:05:00.000Z	Eduard	rigved	after install & restart i was every time thrown into tty1
2010-12-24T12:05:00.000Z	Eduard	rigved	start x complained about missing nvidia driver in location where it was actually present
2010-12-24T12:05:00.000Z	rigved	Eduard	have you upgraded from 10.04 to 10.10?
2010-12-24T12:06:00.000Z	Eduard	rigved	it was a clean slate install 10.10
2010-12-24T12:09:00.000Z	rigved	Eduard	yes you could have fixed the earlier driver (from the repositoris). i don't know if the new NVIDIA drivers from the website can be fixed similarly. see what Us3r_Unfriendly says ^^
2010-12-24T15:12:00.000Z	rigved	Eduard	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
2010-12-24T15:12:00.000Z	Eduard	rigved	stop: Unknown instance:
2010-12-24T15:13:00.000Z	rigved	Eduard	are you in the GUI terminal right now?
2010-12-24T15:13:00.000Z	Eduard	rigved	yes
2010-12-24T15:14:00.000Z	rigved	Eduard	not sure if this will help but hit Ctrl+Alt+F2 the try that command
2010-12-24T15:14:00.000Z	rigved	Eduard	to get back to the GUI, hit Ctrl+Alt+F7
