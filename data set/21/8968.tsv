2008-09-03T23:29:00.000Z	nandemonai	allen	once you have them installed you should be able to enable compiz.
2008-09-03T23:32:00.000Z	nandemonai	allen	new should be fine for that card.
2008-09-03T23:34:00.000Z	nandemonai	allen	log out then back in. (ie restart the X server) then once back in go to system -> prefs -> appearance -> visual effects
2008-09-03T23:36:00.000Z	nandemonai	allen	up to you. extra just has more effects.
2008-09-03T23:38:00.000Z	nandemonai	allen	either pick normal or extra, whichever you prefer.
2008-09-03T23:40:00.000Z	nandemonai	allen	fire window?
2008-09-03T23:40:00.000Z	nandemonai	allen	by default it should fade out.
2008-09-03T23:44:00.000Z	nandemonai	allen	I get the same error. Shouldn't matter.
2008-09-03T23:45:00.000Z	allen	nandemonai	do you now compiz ?

2008-09-03T23:46:00.000Z	nandemonai	allen	might wanna install the settings manager so you can tweak it.
2008-09-03T23:48:00.000Z	nandemonai	allen	sudo apt-get remove program or add/remove or synaptic package manager.
2008-09-03T23:48:00.000Z	nandemonai	allen	I'd suggest reading over the ubuntu guide, lots of info there.
