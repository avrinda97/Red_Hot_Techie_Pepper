2009-08-04T00:38:00.000Z	pepperjack	Kingsy101	seems like a bad cd.  did you burn this at the slowest possible speed?  id try a new cd man sorry
2009-08-04T00:39:00.000Z	Kingsy101	pepperjack	- its not a bad CD cos I have installed ubuntu once already with it
2009-08-04T00:39:00.000Z	pepperjack	Kingsy101	or maybe a crappy old cdrom drive
