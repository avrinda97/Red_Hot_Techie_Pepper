2010-09-08T07:42:00.000Z	Izinucs	ubuntu	yea.. so what is that package..?
2010-09-08T07:42:00.000Z	ubuntu	Izinucs	 its the mbr for windows
2010-09-08T07:43:00.000Z	Izinucs	ubuntu	DOH! yea.. you won't find that in linux
2010-09-08T07:43:00.000Z	ubuntu	Izinucs	 it shows on a site from a old post it works in ubuntu live
2010-09-08T07:44:00.000Z	Izinucs	ubuntu	what's it suppose to do?
2010-09-08T07:44:00.000Z	ubuntu	Izinucs	 its supposed to reinstall my windows main boot load
2010-09-08T07:44:00.000Z	ubuntu	Izinucs	http://www.arsgeek.com/2008/01/15/how-to-fix-your-windows-mbr-with-an-ubuntu-livecd/
2010-09-08T07:46:00.000Z	Izinucs	ubuntu	use your windows disk to do that.  that package is no longer in the repositories that I can find.. are you eliminating ubuntu? or just want the windows bootloader instead of grub?
2010-09-08T07:46:00.000Z	ubuntu	Izinucs	 its oem doesnt come with a disk its partitioned in
2010-09-08T07:46:00.000Z	Izinucs	ubuntu	so why do you want the windows boot loader?
2010-09-08T07:47:00.000Z	ubuntu	Izinucs	 i turned on my laptop and it gave me that error and my bootloader is gone, i need to reinstall it to use my windows
2010-09-08T07:49:00.000Z	Izinucs	ubuntu	when you installed ubuntu did you do a dual boot setup?
2010-09-08T07:49:00.000Z	ubuntu	Izinucs	 didnt install ubuntu
2010-09-08T07:49:00.000Z	Izinucs	ubuntu	so you're just trying to use the live cd to fix your current windows install?
2010-09-08T07:49:00.000Z	ubuntu	Izinucs	 yes
2010-09-08T07:51:00.000Z	Izinucs	ubuntu	without that file available I'm not sure what you can do other than use the live cd to save off all your data and then use the recovery partition to reinstall windows fresh.. you might ask in ##windows
2010-09-08T07:51:00.000Z	ubuntu	Izinucs	 i can not acces the recovery partition
2010-09-08T07:52:00.000Z	Izinucs	ubuntu	why? it's usually a hot key combination
2010-09-12T20:34:00.000Z	Izinucs	ubuntu	do it right and you'll have both to choose from on boot.. it's called a dual boot
2010-09-12T20:36:00.000Z	Izinucs	ubuntu	it's like having 2 computers .. one windows.. one ubuntu.. you make the choice from the menu when you turn the computer on.. *Don't* install it if windows is running.. boot directly from the cd
