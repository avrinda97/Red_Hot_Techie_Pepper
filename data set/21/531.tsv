2011-10-21T06:33:00.000Z	cajunlady		gpm?
2011-10-21T06:34:00.000Z	cajunlady		ok
2011-10-21T06:34:00.000Z	cajunlady		<Mogga>, of course drivers are needed. what is the nic's chipset?
2011-10-21T06:35:00.000Z	Mogga	cajunlady	NetXen NX3031
2011-10-21T06:38:00.000Z	Mogga	cajunlady	it's an hp card - nc522sfp
2011-10-21T06:39:00.000Z	Mogga	cajunlady	i was looking for ixgbe but i think that's the wrong one - looks like it may need a newer kernel or… rhel
2011-10-21T06:42:00.000Z	cajunlady	Mogga	I think the correct driver for that chipset would be "netxen_nic"
2011-10-21T06:43:00.000Z	Mogga	cajunlady	is that available via apt? i'm on 10.04LTS
2011-10-21T06:44:00.000Z	cajunlady	Mogga	I think you might need to recompile the kernel to get it
2011-10-21T06:45:00.000Z	Mogga	cajunlady	there's a first time for everything can you linkslap me
2011-10-21T06:46:00.000Z	cajunlady	Mogga	here's a link to the driver- http://filedownloads.qlogic.com/files/driver/71878/Release_Notes_4_0_305.html
2011-10-21T06:47:00.000Z	Mogga	cajunlady	wow - great
2011-10-21T06:50:00.000Z	Mogga	cajunlady	looks like there is support from 9.04 - what does 'inbox support' mean?
2011-10-21T06:50:00.000Z	cajunlady	Mogga	that means it should have been there in your ubuntu install already. strange it didn't detect the card
2011-10-21T07:02:00.000Z	Mogga	cajunlady	there wouldn't be any issue putting this 8 lane card in a 16 lane slot aside right?
2011-10-21T07:03:00.000Z	cajunlady	Mogga	I don't know. I have an old 3com
2011-10-21T07:11:00.000Z	Mogga	cajunlady	needs a bios update
2011-10-21T07:12:00.000Z	Mogga	cajunlady	the big sticker on the box that i threw to one side
2011-10-21T07:13:00.000Z	cajunlady	Mogga	you need a bios update?
2011-10-21T07:14:00.000Z	Mogga	cajunlady	yeah - the box the nic came in had a big sticker on the front saying a bios update is necessary… i ignored it
2011-10-21T07:15:00.000Z	cajunlady	Mogga	hopefully flashing the bios will help
