2011-02-05T04:48:00.000Z	chaos2358	Starminn	no I tried the info in the link "edited for my system, i.e. names" and nothing. in system preferences the following will not work: about me, appearance, assistive technologies, email settings, keyboard, keyboard shortcuts, monitors, network proxy, preffered applications, ubuntu one, windows. and when i say will not work i mean i click to open and nothing at all happens.
2011-02-05T04:56:00.000Z	chaos2358	Starminn	i dont understand what you mean. when try to run it from command it tells me that what i am trying to run is not installed.
2011-02-05T04:52:00.000Z	Starminn	chaos2358	Look, I just thought I'd suggest it while other people read your question that way you weren't just stuck waiting. You could try running the programs from the terminal and seeing if they exist.
2011-02-05T04:52:00.000Z	chaos2358	Starminn	no I tried the iCan someone please help me???? I am running ubuntu 10.10 in system preferences the following will not work: about me, appearance, assistive technologies, email settings, keyboard, keyboard shortcuts, monitors, network proxy, preffered applications, ubuntu one, windows. and when i say will not work i mean i click to open and nothing at all happens.
2011-02-05T04:53:00.000Z	Starminn	chaos2358	Just keep in mind I'll try to help while others more knowledgable than I can chime in. So you've tried running those applications from the terminal, yes?
2011-02-05T04:54:00.000Z	chaos2358	Starminn	 yes, It tells me the program is not installed and gives a command to install. i enter the command, it says it installs but it still doesnt work
2011-02-05T04:55:00.000Z	Starminn	chaos2358	Why does it tell you it doesn't work? (typo'd your name)
2011-02-05T04:57:00.000Z	Starminn	chaos2358	And when you try to install it what does it say? Does it tell you it has completed installation or does it not act like it?
2011-02-05T04:58:00.000Z	chaos2358	Starminn	it runs through with the installation precentage, like it is installing and then brings my command entry back just as if it installed correctly
2011-02-05T05:00:00.000Z	Starminn	chaos2358	Have you tried installing and running as sudo? (At least installing so everything gets where it needs to be)
2011-02-05T05:00:00.000Z	chaos2358	Starminn	 yes of course.
2011-02-05T05:01:00.000Z	Starminn	chaos2358	:) Just making sure. Alright, well the only thing I'm left with is just reinstalling it. Just back up your Home folder and reinstall Ubuntu. May be killing a fly with a bazooka but at least it'll work. (Anybody else wanna chime in?)
2011-02-05T05:03:00.000Z	chaos2358	Starminn	 i'm hoping I can get away without having to do that because i  have over 150 gigs of media stored on it. family photos, etc
2011-02-05T05:05:00.000Z	Starminn	chaos2358	Just put the Home folder on its own partition and just don't touch that partition on reinstall.

2011-02-07T05:54:00.000Z	Starminn	chaos2358	The more I read the more people say XVidCap is the way to go so I'd try that first.
