2008-02-04T20:14:00.000Z	bod_	louish	what kinda ping times do you get if you ping your router?
2008-02-04T20:15:00.000Z	louish	bod_	  I get 0.791ms  or 0.673 etc
2008-02-04T20:15:00.000Z	bod_	louish	packet loss?
2008-02-04T20:16:00.000Z	louish	bod_	  zero packet loss to everything else on the network.   It's just the new 7.10 install that we can't connect too
2008-02-04T20:16:00.000Z	bod_	louish	cant connect to at all?
2008-02-04T20:17:00.000Z	louish	bod_	   when I boot from the hdd,  I can connect, but when I ping there is like 60+ % packet loss
2008-02-04T20:25:00.000Z	bod_	louish	weird,.,. ok,.
2008-02-04T20:18:00.000Z	bod_	louish	ping ....... ping to where? what happens if you ping www.google.com?
2008-02-04T20:19:00.000Z	louish	bod_	   Every ping to any "other" place works perfect.  It's just fails when I ping the new 7.10 x3500 server
2008-02-04T20:20:00.000Z	bod_	louish	so theres a problem with some esettings somewhere,.,. are you using encryption?
2008-02-04T20:20:00.000Z	louish	bod_	no encryption
2008-02-04T20:21:00.000Z	bod_	louish	using the "slow" 7.10 machine, how fast is browsing the web?
2008-02-04T20:21:00.000Z	louish	bod_	  very fast
2008-02-04T20:22:00.000Z	bod_	louish	how many different machines have u got?
2008-02-04T20:22:00.000Z	louish	bod_	  it looks to me, that the new x3500 and my laptop have some sort of conflict.    I have two Mac's.   4 linux servers and 3 windows servers, and 20 w/s.
2008-02-04T20:23:00.000Z	bod_	louish	oh,.,. lol,.,. id say the problem is not with the "slow" 7.10 machine, merely with whichever one your pinging it with, or its your network,. but im not sure of a fix,. sorry,.,. all comps dhcp?
2008-02-04T20:25:00.000Z	louish	bod_	yes, they are all dhcp, except the servers.   I'm sure the network is fine, since I've booted my laptop with the live cd,   Everything is fine with connecting and pinging the x3500 7.10 server now.
2008-02-04T20:25:00.000Z	louish	bod_	 It's only when I boot from my laptops hdd that no one can connect to the x3500.
2008-02-04T20:26:00.000Z	bod_	louish	im not sure then m8,.,.sorry
2008-02-04T20:26:00.000Z	louish	bod_	Yes,  very weird.    I'm guessing I'll just have to re-install 7.10 on my laptop.
2008-02-04T20:26:00.000Z	bod_	louish	drastic,.,.
