2007-08-25T12:48:00.000Z	BrendanW		Does anybody have any idea how to reverse the effects of compiz --replace -c emerald &?
2007-08-25T12:48:00.000Z	godlygeek	BrendanW	just a guess: metacity --replace ?
2007-08-25T12:49:00.000Z	BrendanW	godlygeek	fr500: Thank you both very much. That worked perfectly. You guys are all so knowledgeable and helpful!
2007-08-25T12:50:00.000Z	godlygeek	BrendanW	np.  :)
2007-08-25T12:58:00.000Z	godlygeek	BrendanW	that probably means that emerald is crashing... though i don't know why it would.
2007-08-25T12:59:00.000Z	godlygeek	BrendanW	uh.. then the gtk-window-decorator...
2007-08-25T12:59:00.000Z	godlygeek	BrendanW	or whatever.  I'm not a big compiz person.
2007-08-25T12:59:00.000Z	BrendanW	godlygeek	One last time, what is the command?
2007-08-25T13:00:00.000Z	godlygeek	BrendanW	do 'metacity --replace' to fix things
2007-08-25T13:00:00.000Z	godlygeek	BrendanW	then open up a terminal, and type 'compiz --replace' there.
2007-08-25T13:01:00.000Z	godlygeek	BrendanW	Er... the thing i sent to me was supposed to go to you  hopefully something useful will show up in the terminal.
2007-08-25T13:15:00.000Z	godlygeek	BrendanW	did 'compiz --replace' from a terminal show any output?
2007-08-25T13:16:00.000Z	BrendanW	godlygeek	My screen flashed, nothing changed. No output in the terminal window.
2007-08-25T13:16:00.000Z	godlygeek	BrendanW	hm.  odd.  compiz always puts something in the terminal for me.  no clue then.
2007-08-25T14:56:00.000Z	godlygeek	BrendanW	They might be in /var/cache/apt
2007-08-25T14:56:00.000Z	BrendanW	godlygeek	Thanks. I'm only wondering because I was trying to decide whether to keep an inventory folder of all my pkgs.
2007-08-25T14:57:00.000Z	godlygeek	BrendanW	you can check what's on your system with a 'sudo updatedb' followed by 'locate -r '.*\.deb$'
2007-08-25T14:57:00.000Z	godlygeek	BrendanW	why would you want to do that?
2007-08-25T14:58:00.000Z	BrendanW	godlygeek	I don't know. I have a tendancy to save installers on Windows, and was wondering if I should on Ubuntu.
2007-08-25T14:58:00.000Z	godlygeek	BrendanW	I see no reason.  the repositories aren't going anywhere, if you need to install... and the uninstall info isn't stored with the .deb
2007-08-25T14:59:00.000Z	BrendanW	godlygeek	Thanks for the advice. I won't be doing that now.
