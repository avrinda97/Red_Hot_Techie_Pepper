2011-12-02T23:02:00.000Z	Guest67345	ivellios	It is ok for a gateway to not resolve domain names.
2011-12-02T23:04:00.000Z	Guest67345	ivellios	llutz If it is a nat sever and he unloads iptables rules, it will break the LAN
2011-12-02T23:04:00.000Z	Guest67345	ivellios	Are the clients unable to resovlve domain names? Or just the server?
2011-12-02T23:05:00.000Z	Guest67345	ivellios	Look at /etc/resov.conf and see what you have there.
2011-12-02T23:06:00.000Z	Guest67345	ivellios	BUt... does it NEED to resovle domain names  for any particular reason?
2011-12-02T23:06:00.000Z	Guest67345	ivellios	Can you ping that first one?

2011-12-02T23:11:00.000Z	ivellios	Guest67345	Error: Bad port ?
2011-12-02T23:11:00.000Z	Guest67345	ivellios	Is this server still 8.04 ?  If so, you really need to upgrade it.
2011-12-02T23:14:00.000Z	Guest67345	ivellios	Actually, if it's ubuntu-server you still have some time yet....
2011-12-02T23:16:00.000Z	Guest67345	ivellios	You may have an iptables rule restricting icmp on the outside nic
2011-12-02T23:17:00.000Z	ivellios	Guest67345	but it was working fine, why would I have such iptable entry now?
2011-12-02T23:22:00.000Z	Guest67345	ivellios	Was working fine until _______________?
2011-12-02T23:23:00.000Z	ivellios	Guest67345	until yesterday: host restarted itself twice, I have made alle updates and then my dynamic IP has changed :/
2011-12-02T23:23:00.000Z	ivellios	Guest67345	the change of IP wasnt problem before
2011-12-02T23:24:00.000Z	ivellios	Guest67345	but self-reseting never happened
2011-12-02T23:24:00.000Z	Guest67345	ivellios	dynamic IP of the server changed?
