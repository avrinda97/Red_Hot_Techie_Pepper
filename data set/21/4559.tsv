2008-04-05T19:41:00.000Z	lopin		I need some help throwing commands to the background, so they don't give me a verbose output, and I can keep giving commands...
2008-04-05T19:42:00.000Z	lopin		It's still throwing out output...
2008-04-05T19:42:00.000Z	lopin		O.O!
2008-04-05T19:42:00.000Z	lopin		Thank you!
2008-04-05T19:42:00.000Z	lopin		Didn't think to send it to null...
2008-04-05T19:43:00.000Z	nickrud	lopin	or a file if you might want to inspect it later
2008-04-05T19:44:00.000Z	nickrud	lopin	depending on the app,  alt-f2 <command> will do also
2008-04-09T04:04:00.000Z	nickrud	lopin	he wasn't talking to you, a bad joke. testx rm -rf is never a joking matter in this channel ;)
2008-04-09T04:04:00.000Z	lopin	nickrud	I know that's not a joking matter!  Which, is why I got concerned when he said it!
2008-04-09T04:06:00.000Z	nickrud	lopin	which ones aren't installing?
2008-04-09T04:06:00.000Z	nickrud	lopin	did you reboot after the ati site driver install?
2008-04-09T04:08:00.000Z	nickrud	lopin	with ati site driver 8.3, don't use xgl
2008-04-09T04:09:00.000Z	nickrud	lopin	xserver-xgl that is, it's not needed since 8.3 has aiglx support
2008-04-09T04:10:00.000Z	nickrud	lopin	but before you do anything else, put a copy of /var/log/Xorg.0.log on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2008-04-09T04:13:00.000Z	nickrud	lopin	for some reason, you're not using the fglrx driver but the open source radeon driver.  edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf , find the driver section and change 'ati' to 'fglrx'
2008-04-09T04:15:00.000Z	nickrud	lopin	oh yes you do
2008-04-09T04:15:00.000Z	nickrud	lopin	if you are absolutely sure, sudo dpkg-reconfigure -pcritical xserver-xorg will build a default, then make the edit I gave
2008-04-09T04:17:00.000Z	nickrud	lopin	mine has never disappeared, no.   do    ls /etc/X11  (make sure you get the caps right)
2008-04-09T04:18:00.000Z	nickrud	lopin	you ran something called driconf? Never heard of it
2008-04-09T04:19:00.000Z	nickrud	lopin	never used it, no opinion on it
2008-04-27T11:15:00.000Z	nickrud	lopin	  sudo do-release-upgrade
