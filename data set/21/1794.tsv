2010-07-09T08:05:00.000Z	Loshki	Maletor	I thought msmtp was a drop-in replacement for sendmail i.e. you should pretend you're still using sendmail. What does ls -l /usr/bin/sendmail point to?
2010-07-09T08:08:00.000Z	Maletor	Loshki	/usr/sbin/sendmail points to exim4
2010-07-09T08:09:00.000Z	Loshki	Maletor	so you're running exim4 as well as msmtp?
2010-07-09T08:09:00.000Z	Maletor	Loshki	I'm following this guide. http://klenwell.com/is/UbuntuCommandLineGmail
2010-07-09T08:09:00.000Z	Maletor	Loshki	And it's not working
2010-07-09T08:12:00.000Z	Loshki	Maletor	I use ssmtp with gmail instead, and it does work. http://www.nixtutor.com/linux/send-mail-with-gmail-and-ssmtp/
2010-07-09T08:14:00.000Z	Maletor	Loshki	well I can send an email with msmtp
2010-07-09T08:14:00.000Z	Maletor	Loshki	but this is about getting it to work with mailx
2010-07-09T08:16:00.000Z	Loshki	Maletor	mailx is just a front end, it should work with any sendmail compatible backend, including exim4 and/or msmtp/ssmtp or even sendmail. Is there anything interesting in the mail logs /var/log/mail.*
2010-07-09T08:17:00.000Z	Maletor	Loshki	I looked there. Just a bunch of spamd stuff. Also, I set the log for smstp to /tmp/msmtp.log and nothing shows up there
2010-07-09T08:26:00.000Z	Maletor	Loshki	so nothing you can think of?
2010-07-09T08:26:00.000Z	Maletor	Loshki	it's as if msmtp is being run without the parameters that mailx is setting
2010-07-09T08:27:00.000Z	Loshki	Maletor	doesn't mailx have a -v (verbose) switch. Try it and see if there's anything obvious. Maybe pastebin the output?
2010-07-09T08:28:00.000Z	Maletor	Loshki	yes it does but it doesn't log anything
2010-07-09T08:28:00.000Z	Maletor	Loshki	this person solved it
2010-07-09T08:29:00.000Z	Maletor	Loshki	but i can't figure what he means http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=780509&page=2
2010-07-09T08:31:00.000Z	Maletor	Loshki	ok ya that solved it. i just needed a different package of mailx. god that was confusing
2010-07-09T08:31:00.000Z	Loshki	Maletor	it's pretty appalling that there are two versions of mailx in different packages, and one works and the other doesn't...
2010-07-09T08:32:00.000Z	Loshki	Maletor	that explains why I've never had a problem with ssmtp....
2010-07-09T08:37:00.000Z	Maletor	Loshki	how can I set it up so that I can read my gmail via command line?
2010-07-09T08:41:00.000Z	Loshki	Maletor	Not many people want to do that, but I found this on google: http://lifehacker.com/275404/access-gmail-from-the-command-line
