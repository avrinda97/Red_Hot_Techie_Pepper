2009-05-24T01:11:00.000Z	CyberJack		Can anyone help me with a mencoder subtitle problem? I try to hardcode subtitles (srt) into a avi file and my subs are always a bit transparent on yellow and blue backgrounds.
2009-05-24T01:11:00.000Z	CyberJack		sorry... wrong channel
2009-05-24T01:13:00.000Z	losher	CyberJack	which channel supports mencoder
2009-05-24T01:14:00.000Z	losher	CyberJack	worth a try if no-one here responds
2009-05-24T01:15:00.000Z	CyberJack	losher	I already did, just have to wait for a response... but that's no problem
2009-05-24T01:18:00.000Z	losher	CyberJack	 I see some google threads about changing subtitle colors in mencoder...
2009-05-24T01:20:00.000Z	CyberJack	losher	The color isn't the problem. White is ok for subtitles, but when the movie has yellow or blue parts behind the subtitle, the color shines thru
2009-05-24T01:22:00.000Z	losher	CyberJack	is this relevant: http://lists.mplayerhq.hu/pipermail/mencoder-users/2008-February/008025.html
2009-05-24T01:25:00.000Z	CyberJack	losher	I haven't converted my subtitles to ssa/ass yet, but I can give it a try.
2009-05-24T01:26:00.000Z	losher	CyberJack	it's not clear to me their solution works for everyone. At your own risk. Perhaps a different encoder might be easier?
2009-05-24T01:28:00.000Z	CyberJack	losher	mencoder is the only program that will hardcode subtitles at good performance. the only alternative I found was avidemux, but it takes about 3 times longer to encode the same file.
2009-05-24T01:29:00.000Z	losher	CyberJack	a slow workaround is better than no workaround at all...
2009-05-24T01:30:00.000Z	CyberJack	losher	thats true
2009-05-24T01:31:00.000Z	losher	CyberJack	if you're going to be doing this a lot, by all means hand patch mencoder source. But unless you're unused to doing such things, or it's a one-off encode, it might be more trouble than it's worth
2009-05-24T01:32:00.000Z	CyberJack	losher	patching and compiling are no problem. My mencoder already has the -ass option, so I about to give it a try
2009-05-24T01:32:00.000Z	losher	CyberJack	unused -> used
2009-05-24T01:33:00.000Z	losher	CyberJack	ok, that's some progress at least
2009-05-24T01:36:00.000Z	CyberJack	losher	it works. ssa/aas subtitles are the solution.
2009-05-24T01:36:00.000Z	losher	CyberJack	excellent. google to the rescue!
2009-05-24T01:38:00.000Z	CyberJack	losher	I already read the post, but I never thought of converting my subtitles to ssa
2009-05-24T01:38:00.000Z	losher	CyberJack	cool, so I added some value, even better....!
