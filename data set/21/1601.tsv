2010-07-08T00:23:00.000Z	cl909	ActionParsnip	yours looks good, thanks
2010-07-08T00:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cl909	its not hard to move, there are LITERALLY thousands of guides for this, did you not websearch any at all??
2010-07-08T00:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cl909	its not a checkbox, its a text field
2010-07-08T00:24:00.000Z	cl909	ActionParsnip	I said MAKE it a checkbox
2010-07-08T00:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cl909	submit a suggestion on http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com
2010-07-08T00:27:00.000Z	cl909	ActionParsnip	Yeah, it can be changed, but It should be a simple setting in "appearance". Is that so far-fetched?
2010-07-08T00:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cl909	there are guides everywhere so its easy to find a fix. i ditched gnome a long time ago so havent seen this nonesense
2010-07-08T00:29:00.000Z	cl909	ActionParsnip	If there was a setting for it in "Appearance" there would be no need for guides at all.
2010-07-08T00:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cl909	you can do it at command line with:    gconftool-2 --set /apps/metacity/general/button_layout --type string menu:minimize,maximize,close
2010-07-08T00:30:00.000Z	cl909	ActionParsnip	all that time wasted, just because there is no setting for it
2010-07-08T00:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cl909	or if you want gui: http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/03/easy-gui-window-button-switcher-for.html
2010-07-08T00:31:00.000Z	cl909	ActionParsnip	thank you, I already did it the way you linked first. Now all you need to do is accept that i'm right and we're finished :D
2010-07-08T00:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cl909	i'm just showing you how many guides there are for this
2010-07-08T00:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cl909	never mind
2010-07-08T00:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cl909	there is no correct position
