2010-08-17T13:44:00.000Z	Hey_neken		Hi, I've bought a new Dell R610 server (2x xeon 5520 16gb) and made a 10.04 server installation. I've serious performance problems with KVM. Is there any known bug related? (i've searched on launchpad and got nothing)
2010-08-17T13:45:00.000Z	ikonia	Hey_neken	make sure virtualisation on the cpu is enabled in the bios
2010-08-17T13:45:00.000Z	Hey_neken	ikonia	it is
2010-08-17T13:45:00.000Z	ikonia	Hey_neken	what sort of performance issues are you having, visual performance issues, or physical processing in the vm issues
2010-08-17T13:46:00.000Z	Hey_neken	ikonia	processing
2010-08-17T13:46:00.000Z	ikonia	Hey_neken	can you give me an example ?
2010-08-17T13:46:00.000Z	Hey_neken		just to compare to the old server (a xeon 3302) i created a new vm with 1 cpu and 512 on each server and the old server with 9.04 is 6x faster
2010-08-17T13:46:00.000Z	Hey_neken		installing ubuntu
2010-08-17T13:47:00.000Z	ikonia		ok - forget the install routine, can you give me an example of it struggling with processing
2010-08-17T13:48:00.000Z	Hey_neken	ikonia	made a cp of a vm from the old to the new server. a vm with a mysql server on it and the app cry at start time on the new server
2010-08-17T13:48:00.000Z	ikonia		please explain better than "cry"
2010-08-17T13:48:00.000Z	Hey_neken		slower
2010-08-17T13:48:00.000Z	Hey_neken		10times slower
2010-08-17T13:49:00.000Z	ikonia	Hey_neken	ok - so please explain how you know that is processing
2010-08-17T13:50:00.000Z	Hey_neken	ikonia	the same VM on a newer and faster machine is slower, what else can it be?
2010-08-17T13:50:00.000Z	ikonia	Hey_neken	it can be many things,
2010-08-17T13:50:00.000Z	ikonia	Hey_neken	hence why I'm asking how you know it's processing
2010-08-17T13:51:00.000Z	Hey_neken	ikonia	they are in the same network attached to the same switch; the same VM has been used to test the same app on the same version; on the 10.04 install I've no other "big" process running, its a fresh install with minimun gnome to user virt-manager
2010-08-17T13:52:00.000Z	ikonia	Hey_neken	ok, so monitor the processors in the virtual machine AND on the host at the same time while you are working/having problems, see if there are any differences in behaviour, or any corolation, that can guide you as to where there are potential issues
2010-08-17T13:53:00.000Z	Hey_neken	ikonia	ok, will
2010-08-17T13:53:00.000Z	ikonia	Hey_neken	got to shoot off now.
