2012-05-04T01:08:00.000Z	Oasa	ThinkT510	: itaws: 5 years. Sorry
2012-05-04T01:26:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Oasa	when you use nvidia i think the nouveau driver just gets blacklisted/disabled rather than removed
2012-05-04T01:26:00.000Z	Oasa	ThinkT510	Please help BlueWolf then
2012-05-04T01:26:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Oasa	you don't need to purge it for the nvidia driver to work
2012-05-04T01:28:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Oasa	sorry, i've never had that problem so not sure how to help him
2012-05-04T01:29:00.000Z	Oasa	ThinkT510	when he opens nvidia control panel it says no nvidia. SO i thought noveaux is still being used
2012-05-04T01:29:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Oasa	sounds like he tried using the nvidia driver from the website rather than the repo
2012-05-04T01:30:00.000Z	Oasa	ThinkT510	he used it from the repo only.
2012-05-04T01:30:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Oasa	hmm, odd, i've never experienced any problems with the driver from the repo
2012-05-04T01:32:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Oasa	i was just about to ask him to pastebin lsmod, but it appears he's left
2012-05-04T01:32:00.000Z	Oasa	ThinkT510	hmmm
2012-05-04T01:40:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Oasa	that isn't supported, it will break things
2012-05-04T01:41:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Oasa	i doubt they will allow relocation of the sidebar
2012-05-04T01:41:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Oasa	xfce is still my favourite, it is awesome to be free to choose
2012-05-04T01:48:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Oasa	low level direct copy
