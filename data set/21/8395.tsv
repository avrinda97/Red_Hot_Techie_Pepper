2006-04-20T07:28:00.000Z	rabe		and then?
2006-04-20T07:28:00.000Z	rabe		i opened it
2006-04-20T07:29:00.000Z	rabe		ok
2006-04-20T07:31:00.000Z	rabe		ok, what to do there?
2006-04-20T07:32:00.000Z	rabe		Driver      "fglrx"
2006-04-20T07:32:00.000Z	rabe		i did :-)
2006-04-20T07:33:00.000Z	rabe		direct rendering: no
2006-04-20T07:34:00.000Z	rabe		ok, but the problem lays there, slavik:
2006-04-20T07:36:00.000Z	rabe		  when removing `diversion of /usr/lib/libGL.so.1.2 to /usr/share/fglrx/diversions/libGL.so.1.2 by xorg-driver-fglrx'
2006-04-20T07:37:00.000Z	rabe		E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)
2006-04-20T07:39:00.000Z	nickrud	rabe	that error depends on the context, paste the whole error to pastebin
2006-04-20T07:39:00.000Z	nickrud	rabe	nm, I didn't read back far enough
2006-04-20T07:40:00.000Z	rabe	nickrud	nevermind, you can still help me since i did just that of the wiki: http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Breezy_Installation_Guide#Method_2:_Generating.2FInstalling_Ubuntu_packages_for_the_newer_8.24.8_drivers_in_Breezy_Badger
2006-04-20T07:40:00.000Z	nickrud	rabe	dpkg-divert is obscure, and especially when it's fglrx which I've never used. sorry to have wasted your time
2006-04-20T07:51:00.000Z	nickrud	rabe	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ is a pastebin
2006-04-20T07:52:00.000Z	nickrud	rabe	you can drag the mouse (hold the left button & drag) across some text in a terminal, then hit the middle button on the mouse in the pastebin text box
2006-04-20T07:56:00.000Z	nickrud	rabe	^^^
2006-04-20T07:57:00.000Z	rabe	nickrud	still not working
2006-04-20T07:58:00.000Z	nickrud	rabe	then I'd try dpkg -r --force-remove-reinstreq <package>
2006-04-20T07:59:00.000Z	rabe	nickrud	still not working
2006-04-20T08:00:00.000Z	nickrud	rabe	like I said a while back, dpkg-divert is not my forte. Those were the two arrows in my quiver at the moment. Sorry
