2008-01-11T02:50:00.000Z	xzased		Hiya guys. Im still having problems with the "nvidia" driver. My screen is stuck at 800x600 resolution and 1/2 inch of my screen is black (at the right column)
2008-01-11T02:50:00.000Z	ikonia	xzased	what card ?
2008-01-11T02:52:00.000Z	ikonia	xzased	what version of the nvidia-glx package did you install
2008-01-11T02:52:00.000Z	xzased	ikonia	How can I check it?
2008-01-11T02:52:00.000Z	ikonia	xzased	dpkg - l | grep -i nvidia
2008-01-11T02:52:00.000Z	ikonia	xzased	or jsut look in synaptic
2008-01-11T02:54:00.000Z	xzased	ikonia	The version is  1:96.43.01+2.6.22-14
2008-01-11T02:54:00.000Z	ikonia	xzased	what is the version of the package installed
2008-01-11T02:57:00.000Z	xzased	ikonia	It only gives me these numers under version:
2008-01-11T03:00:00.000Z	xzased	ikonia	under nvidia-settings, the driver is 96.43.01
2008-01-11T03:01:00.000Z	ikonia	xzased	please do dpkg -l | grep -i nvidia and tell me if the package is nvidia-glx, nvidia-glx-new or nvidia-glx-legacy
2008-01-11T03:02:00.000Z	ikonia	xzased	remove it, you need nvidia-glx-legacy
2008-01-11T03:02:00.000Z	ikonia	xzased	you want the older drivers
2008-01-11T03:03:00.000Z	xzased	ikonia	How can I enable glx on the older ones. I cant use opengl with those
2008-01-11T03:03:00.000Z	ikonia	xzased	who said that ?
2008-01-11T04:18:00.000Z	ikonia	xzased	is it supported on your card/driver
2008-01-11T04:19:00.000Z	xzased	ikonia	yes, it worked under the "nvidia" driver. My resolution was messed up but the glx worked great
2008-01-11T04:19:00.000Z	ikonia	xzased	did you reconfigure your display to have the correct resolution
2008-01-11T04:22:00.000Z	xzased	ikonia	With the legacy driver the resolution works well out of the box, its just the glx not working. With the "nvidia driver, the resolution got stuck at 800x600, I tried to modify my xorg.conf file but nothing worked.... and it confused the crt-out port of my laptop with the lcd screen.
2008-01-11T04:22:00.000Z	ikonia	xzased	thats a tough balancing act
2008-01-11T04:23:00.000Z	xzased	ikonia	it sure is
