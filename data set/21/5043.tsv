2009-07-15T11:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		pcspkr module controlls the old fashioned 'beeps' that used to be made by the speakers on the motherboard. (rember those days?) :)
2009-07-15T11:41:00.000Z	Lartza_	Dr_Willis	Thos beeps he is turning off
2009-07-15T11:42:00.000Z	Lartza_	Dr_Willis	What does the xset do?
2009-08-19T17:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Lartza_	 if you just did it from the cli. yes...
2009-08-19T17:55:00.000Z	Lartza_	Dr_Willis	Terminal, can I make it permanent without running it on boot?
2009-08-19T17:56:00.000Z	Lartza_	Dr_Willis	I haven't yet found how to change my keyboard layout
2009-08-19T17:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Lartza_	 proberly can have a setting somewhere that it uses.. No idea what it does.. or run it from rc.local or your X startup stuff.. Ive no clue what the command does.
2009-08-19T17:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Lartza_	 gnome has its own settings to change thekeyboard layout i thought
2009-08-19T17:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Lartza_	 then you check the openbox docs and figure out  how it 'autostarts' things
2009-08-19T18:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Lartza_	 hal  Most likely.
2009-08-19T18:02:00.000Z	Lartza_	Dr_Willis	As in detect what kind keyboard I have?
2009-08-19T18:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Lartza_	 no idea how it does it. I only have usa keyboards..  HAL does most all the auto detection now  for X i think.
2009-08-19T18:04:00.000Z	Lartza_	Dr_Willis	Well I have finnish keyboard so HAL shouldn't detect it as us :S I'll just write it to xorg.conf it is finnish
2009-08-19T18:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Lartza_	 no idea on any of that.    its all voo-doo-magic
2009-08-19T18:05:00.000Z	Lartza_	Dr_Willis	I read HAL does most of the that so you are right but xorg.conf can still be used
2009-12-22T20:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Lartza_	 yes - most netbook remix's are for atom cpus
2009-12-22T20:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Lartza_	 most normal disrtos work fine on them also
2010-05-19T20:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Lartza_	 odd.. ive never had to edit that file for my vnc servers.
2010-05-19T20:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Lartza_	 check your .vnc directory and its logs and be sure its running an actual desktop/window manager.
2010-05-19T20:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Lartza_	 also close out/kill any vnsserver sessions you accidently run. You really need 3 going?
2010-05-19T20:25:00.000Z	Lartza_	Dr_Willis	He's not that computer genius :)
