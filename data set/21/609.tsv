2012-10-09T17:00:00.000Z	bazhang	no_gravity	worth a check into linux-backports-modules for that
2012-10-09T17:00:00.000Z	bazhang	no_gravity	if you gave us the exact atheros we could be more certain
2012-10-09T17:02:00.000Z	no_gravity	bazhang	its a tl-wn721n.
2012-10-09T17:04:00.000Z	no_gravity	bazhang	what do you mean?
2012-10-09T17:04:00.000Z	bazhang	no_gravity	read the link
2012-10-09T17:05:00.000Z	no_gravity	bazhang	i did. but i dont understand the question "this one?".
2012-10-09T17:05:00.000Z	bazhang	no_gravity	is that one your card
2012-10-09T17:06:00.000Z	no_gravity	bazhang	my card is mentioned on that page, yes. looks like it works under ubuntu 11.

2012-10-09T17:07:00.000Z	no_gravity	bazhang	yes, thanks.
2012-10-09T17:07:00.000Z	bazhang	no_gravity	mint's not supported here
2012-10-09T17:08:00.000Z	no_gravity	bazhang	i didnt ask for mint support.
2012-10-09T17:08:00.000Z	bazhang	no_gravity	you are asking for help, and say you will install mint. go to mintsupport
2012-10-09T17:09:00.000Z	no_gravity	bazhang	i asked for help with my ubuntu installation. i never asked for help with mint.
2012-10-09T17:10:00.000Z	no_gravity	bazhang	the same happens when you mention ubuntu on #debian. everybody goes crazy... i use many OSes on my machines. so its hard to avoid mentioning that.
