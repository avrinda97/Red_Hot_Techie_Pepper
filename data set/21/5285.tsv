2008-03-05T05:33:00.000Z	lunks		What has to be on xorg in order to support more than one mouse? I've remade my xorg.conf, so probably there are some default values missing. I plugged an extra mouse on my notebook, and it shows up on dmseg, but does not move the cursor.
2008-03-05T05:34:00.000Z	ali1234	lunks	apparently nothing much in particular...
2008-03-05T05:34:00.000Z	lunks	ali1234	as I said, it's being detected by dmesg, so it *should* work, but for some reason it's not. :P
2008-03-05T05:35:00.000Z	ali1234	lunks	is it USB then?
2008-03-05T05:35:00.000Z	lunks	ali1234	yes, it is
2008-03-05T05:35:00.000Z	lunks	ali1234	Are you on a notebook and using USB mice?
2008-03-05T05:36:00.000Z	lunks	ali1234	if you are, could you please share your xorg.conf at pastebin?
2008-03-05T05:36:00.000Z	lunks		!pastebin ali1234
2008-03-05T05:36:00.000Z	ali1234	lunks	i had a very old laptop that forced you to choose between ps/2 or touchpad. both were detected but only one would cause events.
2008-03-05T05:36:00.000Z	lunks		oops
2008-03-05T05:36:00.000Z	lunks	ali1234	probably it's a faulty xorg.conf
2008-03-05T05:37:00.000Z	ali1234	lunks	actually you know i havn't tried using two mice since making a dual-head set up with nvidia-settings so mine might not be default
2008-03-05T05:38:00.000Z	ali1234	lunks	here it is though (and i'm using USB): http://rafb.net/p/EGs1Kn55.html
2008-03-05T05:38:00.000Z	lunks	ali1234	I'm using a touchpad specific driver
2008-03-05T05:39:00.000Z	lunks	ali1234	Thank you very much, I'll check
2008-03-05T05:40:00.000Z	lunks	ali1234	I'm using a synaptics drive for the touchpad, I'll try switching to auto
2008-03-05T05:40:00.000Z	ali1234	lunks	that will probably make all the special touchpad stuff stop working
2008-03-05T05:40:00.000Z	lunks	ali1234	I re-checked and it's not it at all.
2008-03-05T05:40:00.000Z	lunks	ali1234	oh well, thanks for your time, at least =)
2008-03-05T05:41:00.000Z	lunks	ali1234	I'll keep searching
