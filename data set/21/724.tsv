2011-08-04T14:54:00.000Z	AegisX		Is there an easy way to uninstall Unity and replace it with a different window manager?
2011-08-04T14:55:00.000Z	somsip	AegisX	just install anoher one, and choose that when logging into the gnome session
2011-08-04T14:56:00.000Z	somsip	AegisX	it's worth not stripping stuff out until you're happy with your new setup
2011-08-04T14:56:00.000Z	somsip	AegisX	which wm you looking at?
2011-08-04T14:57:00.000Z	somsip	AegisX	from memory, you can install lubuntu-desktop and get the xfce package in that. From memory though - better to check
2011-08-04T14:58:00.000Z	somsip	AegisX	always better to form your own opinions. Torvalds is not exactly a 'normal' user...
2011-08-04T14:58:00.000Z	AegisX	somsip	That's true, but his comments highlighted several things that annoy me about Unity.
2011-08-04T14:58:00.000Z	somsip	AegisX	i don't use unity myself, so I can see where he is coming from
2011-08-04T14:59:00.000Z	AegisX	somsip	For example, lack of a proper program list, or the notifications that seem impossible to disable.
2011-08-04T15:00:00.000Z	AegisX	somsip	Out of curiosity, what do you use?
2011-08-04T15:00:00.000Z	somsip	AegisX	awesome
2011-08-04T15:02:00.000Z	AegisX	somsip	Oh, I'd never heard of that before. It looks really lightweight haha
2011-08-04T15:03:00.000Z	somsip	AegisX	yes - I find it fast. Bi strange to get used to, but getting there
2011-08-04T15:03:00.000Z	AegisX	somsip	Not for the faint of heart, I guess. I'll give Lubuntu and Gnome 3 a try. Thanks for the advice :)
2011-08-04T15:04:00.000Z	somsip	AegisX	I did try lubuntu-desktop and it give me the taste t try even lighter still. It seems to be a constant work in progress
2011-08-04T15:05:00.000Z	somsip	AegisX	..getting my seup right is a work in progress...not lubuntu as such
2011-08-04T15:05:00.000Z	AegisX	somsip	Yeah, that's the constant battle in Linux haha
2011-08-04T15:05:00.000Z	AegisX	somsip	For some reason, Ubuntu seems to be stripping away configuration options with each subsequent release.
2011-08-04T15:06:00.000Z	AegisX	somsip	I'm seriously considering Debian.
2011-08-04T15:06:00.000Z	somsip	AegisX	aiming at the 200 million desktop users I guess. Need to be..easy for the less informed to use
2011-08-04T15:06:00.000Z	somsip	AegisX	can we take this OT? I don't like filling up #ubuntu with chat
