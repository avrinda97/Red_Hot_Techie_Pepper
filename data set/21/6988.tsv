2006-12-24T06:36:00.000Z	mc_ren		is there any good guide on setting up some kind of ssh tunnel which allows me to connect to a client behind a nat while i'm at a remote box.
2006-12-24T06:36:00.000Z	mc_ren		?
2006-12-24T06:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	mc_ren	google tsocks
2006-12-24T06:37:00.000Z	mc_ren	thoreauputic	i allready looked out on google
2006-12-24T06:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	mc_ren	and read the ssh man page with attention to the -D flag
2006-12-24T06:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	mc_ren	yes
2006-12-24T06:37:00.000Z	mc_ren	thoreauputic	will this also work when client is behind box?
2006-12-24T06:38:00.000Z	thoreauputic	mc_ren	you need a proxy server to connect to of course (using ssh)
2006-12-24T06:38:00.000Z	mc_ren	thoreauputic	a proxy? on the nat box or on my home box`?
2006-12-24T06:38:00.000Z	thoreauputic	mc_ren	another box on thenet
2006-12-24T06:39:00.000Z	mc_ren	thoreauputic	this faces me with a huge problem: i don't have a third, independent box!
2006-12-24T06:40:00.000Z	thoreauputic	mc_ren	e.g.  ssh -D 1080 user@box.org  <-- need a shell to do this (elsewhere)
2006-12-24T06:40:00.000Z	thoreauputic	mc_ren	fluxbox rocks!
2006-12-24T06:41:00.000Z	mc_ren	thoreauputic	to be honest i've only seen some screenshots. but they didn't really convict me
2006-12-24T06:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	mc_ren	you need to live with flux for a while to appreciate it :)
2006-12-24T06:43:00.000Z	mc_ren	thoreauputic	i could live well with my ubuntu if i just could ssh with it to this box here. withoud a third pc
2006-12-24T06:46:00.000Z	thoreauputic	mc_ren	you were warned
2006-12-24T06:48:00.000Z	mc_ren	thoreauputic	can you help me with that ssh issue?
