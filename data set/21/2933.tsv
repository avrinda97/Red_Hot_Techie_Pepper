2011-10-08T08:00:00.000Z	crash1hd		Hmm should the swap go at the beginning or the end of a drive? or does it really even matter? I am asking because I always thought it was supposed to go at the beginning but when I installed ubuntu on this small drive it put the swap automatically at the end? thoguths?
2011-10-08T08:01:00.000Z	crash1hd		*thoughts?
2011-10-08T08:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	crash1hd	 not really a big issue these days
2011-10-14T12:43:00.000Z	dr_willis	crash1hd	 10 to 20gb is good for / rest for home
2011-10-14T12:44:00.000Z	dr_willis	crash1hd	 a /boot/ is normally not needed these days also.
2011-10-14T12:44:00.000Z	crash1hd	dr_willis	what was the logic?
2011-10-14T12:44:00.000Z	dr_willis	crash1hd	 old limits on lilo and other reasons
2011-10-14T12:45:00.000Z	dr_willis	crash1hd	 easier to bqckup and upgrade later
2011-10-14T12:45:00.000Z	dr_willis	crash1hd	 or clean installs a lot easier
2011-10-14T12:48:00.000Z	dr_willis	crash1hd	 the system/os ;)
2011-10-14T12:48:00.000Z	crash1hd	dr_willis	right so if all data is on the /home or elsewhere and since ubuntu takes up less then 3gb of space would it be safe to assume that 10gb would be plenty?
2011-10-14T12:49:00.000Z	dr_willis	crash1hd	 i suggest 20gb. i have filled up 10gb /  befor
2011-10-14T12:49:00.000Z	crash1hd	dr_willis	ok thats why I am asking cause I am trying to figure out what would fill it?
2011-10-14T12:49:00.000Z	crash1hd	dr_willis	just programs?
2011-10-14T12:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	crash1hd	 tmp, vms cache...
2011-10-14T12:51:00.000Z	crash1hd	dr_willis	ahh had not thought of vms you mean virtual machines?
2011-10-14T12:51:00.000Z	dr_willis	crash1hd	 yes
2011-10-14T12:51:00.000Z	crash1hd	dr_willis	ok :)
2011-10-14T12:52:00.000Z	crash1hd	dr_willis	this system is mostly for deluge as its my main server which is being connected to from the atv with xbmc
2011-10-14T12:59:00.000Z	crash1hd	dr_willis	lighta, Thankyou both :) installing now, have either of you used EFI? do you know if its worth it or not? I have a choice to have it or not
2011-10-15T13:59:00.000Z	dr_willis	crash1hd	 i doubt it. a .img file could be most anything..
