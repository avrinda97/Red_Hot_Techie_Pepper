2006-01-23T16:18:00.000Z	crimsun	Agiofws	I just told you
2006-01-23T16:18:00.000Z	Agiofws	crimsun	 i DONT  USE A GUI OR GNOME oR KDE
2006-01-23T16:19:00.000Z	crimsun	Agiofws	then next time please specify you mean mounting of partitions, not devices, thanks.
2006-01-23T16:19:00.000Z	Agiofws	crimsun	 it mounts  partitions automatically do you whch script is doing it ?
2006-01-23T16:20:00.000Z	crimsun	Agiofws	/what/ is being automatically mounted?
2006-01-23T16:21:00.000Z	Agiofws	crimsun	 de/hdaX  and /dev/hdabX
2006-01-23T16:21:00.000Z	crimsun	Agiofws	then you need to edit /etc/fstab and append 'noauto' to the options line(s)
2006-01-23T16:22:00.000Z	Agiofws	crimsun	  thats not such a good  solution
2006-01-23T16:24:00.000Z	crimsun	Agiofws	/etc/rcS.d/S35mountall.sh is a symlink to /etc/init.d/mountall.sh, which contains a call to mount -a
2006-01-23T16:24:00.000Z	crimsun	Agiofws	simply remove the -a
2006-01-23T16:24:00.000Z	crimsun	Agiofws	be aware that you're changing the semantics of the boot, though.
2006-01-23T16:24:00.000Z	crimsun	Agiofws	it /really/ is a much better idea to place 'noauto' in /etc/fstab
2006-01-23T16:25:00.000Z	Agiofws	crimsun	 ok done it in fstab
2006-01-23T16:25:00.000Z	Agiofws	crimsun	 something else
2006-01-23T16:25:00.000Z	Agiofws	crimsun	 le me reboot
