2006-08-16T14:24:00.000Z	hkBst		is there a way to prevent proprietary modules (which taint the kernel) from loading? I need to prevent ltmodem from loading.
2006-08-16T14:25:00.000Z	thoreauputic	hkBst	put the modules in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist IIRC
2006-08-16T14:26:00.000Z	hkBst	thoreauputic	thanks. I'll check it out. What about when booting from livecd?
2006-08-16T14:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	hkBst	you might want to look at gnewsense :) see http://www.gnewsense.org/
2006-08-16T14:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	hkBst	there's a toorent - it's an RMS friendly live CD :)
2006-08-16T14:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	hkBst	if you want a taint-free live CD that's the one - I'm seeding it with about 6 others
2006-08-16T14:31:00.000Z	hkBst	thoreauputic	thanks, i'll certainly give it a try. What's the popular distro it's based on?
2006-08-16T14:31:00.000Z	thoreauputic	hkBst	Ubuntu of course :)
2006-08-16T14:31:00.000Z	thoreauputic	hkBst	it's actually Ubuntu without the restricted bits and including emacs ;-)
2006-08-16T14:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	hkBst	I aaume emacs is to keep Richard happy ;-)
2006-08-16T14:33:00.000Z	hkBst	thoreauputic	great 8^]  why the secrecy though? Also google and wikipedia don't know anything about it. How often does that happen!!!
2006-08-16T14:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic	hkBst	ah, I asume that's you in the torrent now
2006-08-16T14:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic	hkBst	heh - I only found out about it a few days ago
2006-08-16T14:34:00.000Z	hkBst	thoreauputic	yep :) going 350KB/s which is as much as my adsl can handle :)
2006-08-16T14:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic	hkBst	it's veryu early days, that's all - please help with the seeding :)
2006-08-16T14:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic	hkBst	cool - most of that is coming from here then :)
2006-08-16T14:35:00.000Z	thoreauputic	hkBst	ah , sorry - about a tenth from here - I misread :)
2006-08-16T14:36:00.000Z	hkBst	thoreauputic	seeding, sure. that just means leaving ktorrent open right?
2006-08-16T14:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	hkBst	yep
2006-08-16T14:37:00.000Z	hkBst	thoreauputic	let's write a wikipedia stub about it
2006-08-16T14:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	hkBst	you might want to talk to ompaul in #ubuntu-ops - I don't know much about it yet
