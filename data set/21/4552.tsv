2008-06-15T03:08:00.000Z	Sun01Tech		i get this error when the live ubuntu installer copying files to hard disk {errno 5} input/output error  ---- i have checked the cd and it was verified aready and the iso passed the hash test...this is a new sata hard drive..windows xp 64 installed working good in the past?
2008-06-15T03:09:00.000Z	Sun01Tech		luigi: you probably should do a recovery bootup and try to the options there
2008-06-15T03:10:00.000Z	LtL	Sun01Tech	that's not a healthy error, i'd considered re-trying the install after you re-prepare the target free space and or partition.
2008-06-15T03:11:00.000Z	Sun01Tech	LtL	this is my 6 time trying the install
2008-06-15T03:11:00.000Z	LtL	Sun01Tech	something isn't right..
2008-06-15T03:12:00.000Z	LtL	Sun01Tech	is the cd drive clean 'n healthy?
2008-06-15T03:12:00.000Z	LtL	Sun01Tech	is the partition clean and healthy
2008-06-15T03:14:00.000Z	Sun01Tech	LtL	that was what i was thinking...but i tried different cds and different partition....i tried booting up with puppy linux that works fine.....but yeah im thinking it might be the drive.....i wanted to install iso on usb drive and boot from there but
2008-06-15T03:14:00.000Z	LtL	Sun01Tech	do you get a consistant i/o error?
2008-06-15T03:15:00.000Z	Sun01Tech	LtL	mostly ltl had other times like kubuntu where it just froze after awhile
2008-06-15T03:15:00.000Z	LtL	Sun01Tech	i'm using a junky pIII hp notebook and no ubuntu would install, i grabbed debian disk 1 iso and all rocked outa the box
2008-06-15T03:17:00.000Z	Sun01Tech	LtL	could it be the size of my sata drive 320gb i had no problem installing to my 160gb in the past
2008-06-15T03:18:00.000Z	LtL	Sun01Tech	one of mine is a 250gb sata, no problems using ubuntu since ubuntu version 1 whatever that was.
2008-06-15T03:19:00.000Z	LtL	Sun01Tech	size should'nt be an issue, i'd suggest booting a gparted cd and clean that drive up.
2008-06-15T03:22:00.000Z	LtL	Sun01Tech	i googled that and got quite a few hits, looks like a bug.
2008-06-15T03:22:00.000Z	Sun01Tech	LtL	oh
2008-06-15T03:26:00.000Z	LtL	Sun01Tech	yah that what he means, is the cd drive clean
2008-06-15T03:27:00.000Z	Sun01Tech	LtL	i never cleaned it.....i think that is the problem...i guess i should buy one of those cd/dvd drive cleaners at best buy or radio shack....?
2008-06-15T03:28:00.000Z	LtL	Sun01Tech	md5sum the iso to see if it's non-corrupt.
2008-06-15T03:28:00.000Z	Sun01Tech	LtL	i did already its not that
2008-06-15T03:28:00.000Z	LtL	Sun01Tech	clean is good.
