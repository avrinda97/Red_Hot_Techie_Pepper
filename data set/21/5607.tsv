2007-09-15T09:38:00.000Z	bozza_		hey sorry system got stuck
2007-09-15T09:39:00.000Z	bozza_		i thought linux wasnt meant to crash
2007-09-15T09:40:00.000Z	bozza_		ok this is what command line tells me when the mistake happens
2007-09-15T09:40:00.000Z	bozza_		** (.:5417): CRITICAL **: clearlooks_style_draw_focus: assertion `height >= -1' failed
2007-09-15T09:40:00.000Z	bozza_		this is when i go into fullscreen
2007-09-15T09:41:00.000Z	bozza_		can someone help me on my problems with watching videos please
2007-09-15T09:42:00.000Z	bozza_		well basically every time i watch a move . it starts up and works fine .. but when i do something like maxmise the window
2007-09-15T09:42:00.000Z	bozza_		it goes black
2007-09-15T09:42:00.000Z	bozza_		yea i have compiz
2007-09-15T09:43:00.000Z	bozza_		 . but first time i tried it it worked
2007-09-15T09:43:00.000Z	kkathman	bozza_	 thats why
2007-09-15T09:43:00.000Z	kkathman	bozza_	 i have a similar, occasional prob like that, not just with movie players tho with other windows
2007-09-15T09:44:00.000Z	kkathman	bozza_	 I think it may have something to do with the way compiz manages memory and its slow to react
2007-09-15T09:44:00.000Z	kkathman	bozza_	you certainly should try that
2007-09-15T09:45:00.000Z	kkathman	bozza_	 it seems to me it happens when I've left my browser open for a while - firefox is especially bad about eating mem
2007-09-15T09:45:00.000Z	kkathman	bozza_	 there are probably some downloadable things but I dont know of any offhand
2007-09-15T09:47:00.000Z	bozza_	kkathman	or if i put a window ontop of vlc
2007-09-15T09:47:00.000Z	kkathman	bozza_	 hmm have you tried mplayer instead ??
2007-09-15T09:53:00.000Z	bozza_	kkathman	i got it working .... kinda
2007-09-15T09:53:00.000Z	bozza_	kkathman	my videos are playing .. but only through filters
2007-09-15T09:54:00.000Z	kkathman	bozza_	 using what player?
