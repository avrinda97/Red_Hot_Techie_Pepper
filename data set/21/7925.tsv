2007-12-22T22:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jed	manually edit your xorg
2007-12-22T22:14:00.000Z	jed	Jack_Sparrow	5 year old laptop lcd, absolutely no info on it anywhere :(
2007-12-22T22:15:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jed	You really need to have that or accept the defaults...

2007-12-22T22:25:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jed	You said you couldnt find anything on your laptop.. that is the manual for it
2007-12-22T22:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jed	IT is standard xga tft
2007-12-25T10:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jed	Until you have some experience, stay with the repos.. or install a second copy of ubuntu on a different partition and play with that.. or have a second home partition to make reinstalls easier
2007-12-25T10:49:00.000Z	jed	Jack_Sparrow	I've seen that about 5 times now
2007-12-25T10:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jed	And have you actually DONE any of it.

2007-12-25T10:50:00.000Z	jed	Jack_Sparrow	YES
2007-12-25T10:50:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jed	If you HAD, you would know generic vesa mode is 1024x768 and you would not be stuck at 800x600
2007-12-25T10:52:00.000Z	jed	Jack_Sparrow	I *CAN* load up 1024x768 except I'm missing about 1" of screen space. Let me look into this "generic vesa mode" and see if that IS the problem.
2007-12-25T10:55:00.000Z	jed	Jack_Sparrow	I looked through your FAQ yet again and there isn't anything relevant there that I haven't tried yet. Can you look into my problem instead of spamming FAQ links at me?
2007-12-25T10:56:00.000Z	jed	Jack_Sparrow	Thank you for proving my point :D
2007-12-25T11:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jed	the title says you cant get 1024 working, yet you admit you can, you just dont like it...
2007-12-25T11:03:00.000Z	jed	Jack_Sparrow	are you going to help me or just waste my time?
