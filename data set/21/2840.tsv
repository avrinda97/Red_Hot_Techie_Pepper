2009-06-04T22:13:00.000Z	jmulloy		How can I get OpenOffice files to open from an smb share within Nautilus?
2009-06-04T22:13:00.000Z	moreia	jmulloy	I'm able to open OOo files from an smb share w/in Nautilus. What happens when you try?
2009-06-04T22:14:00.000Z	jmulloy	moreia	It opens in archive manager for .odt and .xls files prompt add and remove to offer to download another SS program.
2009-06-04T22:16:00.000Z	moreia	jmulloy	not sure what you mean by "SS" program, but can you right click in Nautilus and choose OOo Writer/Calc from the "Open with other application ..." option?
2009-06-04T22:17:00.000Z	jmulloy	moreia	I have tried that ... it will attempt to open the file but OpenOffice opens empty.
2009-06-04T22:17:00.000Z	moreia	jmulloy	this only happens on smb shares?
2009-06-04T22:17:00.000Z	moreia	jmulloy	like if you drag the file to your desktop does it open fine?
2009-06-04T22:18:00.000Z	moreia	jmulloy	and what Ubuntu version are you on?
2009-06-04T22:18:00.000Z	jmulloy	moreia	9.04 and if I drag it to the desktop it opens fine.
2009-06-04T22:25:00.000Z	moreia	jmulloy	"local admin account" is what? a smb user or a local workstation user?
2009-06-04T22:26:00.000Z	moreia	jmulloy	and what OS is running on the smb server?
2009-06-04T22:27:00.000Z	jmulloy	moreia	the primary local workstation account ... the accounts it does not work with authenticate to an LDAP server and have their home directories mounted vie NFS.
2009-06-04T22:28:00.000Z	jmulloy	moreia	So after I login to a "network" account I can open files fine in their NFS home directories but they cannot open "group" files shared via smb.
2009-06-04T22:29:00.000Z	jmulloy	moreia	An OSX server is serving NFS, SMB, LDAP, and other stuff that is irrelevent to this issue.
2009-06-04T22:30:00.000Z	moreia	jmulloy	unfortunately, I'm stumped too.
2009-06-04T22:30:00.000Z	jmulloy	moreia	I am super stumped ... been searching Google for days and haven't even had a slightly off topic hit.
2009-06-04T22:31:00.000Z	jmulloy	moreia	I can't be the only one trying to run this setup.
2009-06-04T22:31:00.000Z	moreia	jmulloy	ubuntu workstations accessing smb shares on an OSX server? No. You can't be the only person.
2009-06-04T22:32:00.000Z	jmulloy	moreia	matrixblue, what kills me is it works perfectly with a regular account it only fails on the network accounts ... which is what all my users will be using.
2009-06-04T22:34:00.000Z	jmulloy	moreia	thank you for trying anyway.
2009-06-04T22:36:00.000Z	moreia	jmulloy	sure. sorry I didn't come up with any silver bullets. In my experience, OSX server is a big headache, but I haven't touched it in years.
