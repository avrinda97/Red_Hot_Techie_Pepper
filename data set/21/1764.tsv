2011-01-11T17:30:00.000Z	glaceman		hey guys, what;s the equivalent of programs files for ubuntu ?
2011-01-11T17:31:00.000Z	acicula_	glaceman	typically /usr and its various subdirectory. the structure is not in any way similar to windows though
2011-01-11T17:32:00.000Z	acicula_	glaceman	programs arent grouped in directorys by programs but by functionality or filetype/purpose
2011-01-11T17:33:00.000Z	glaceman	acicula_	i guess i got a lot to learn :D
2011-01-11T17:33:00.000Z	acicula_	glaceman	its better/easier to just backup your home directory with data and store the description of your system installation(instead of the actual installation). to reinstall simply use the description to reinstall (exactly the same) system and put back your data (which only resides in /home/<youruser>
2011-01-11T17:37:00.000Z	acicula_	glaceman	/var/ is the system datastore, /usr/local is for installing software system wide thats not managed by the packagemanager and /etc contains the global system configuration
2011-01-11T17:38:00.000Z	acicula_	glaceman	typically jsut /home would be enough, but if you run things like databases or webservers and such you would want /var too
2011-01-11T17:38:00.000Z	glaceman	acicula_	can u try please to give exemple as window so i can understand, if u know what i mean
2011-01-11T17:43:00.000Z	acicula_	glaceman	tried pressing pause?
2011-01-11T17:43:00.000Z	glaceman	acicula_	no it;s very quick during the boot process of ubuntu
2011-01-11T17:43:00.000Z	acicula_	glaceman	yes pause works there too
