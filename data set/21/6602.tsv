2007-03-07T17:57:00.000Z	ikonia_		techie I don't think there is much of a difference, its more how its setup
2007-03-07T17:57:00.000Z	ikonia_		yeti need more info
2007-03-07T17:57:00.000Z	techie		Ikonia_ perhaps is all the extra stuff I had on xp!
2007-03-07T17:57:00.000Z	ikonia_		techie possibly, which is nothing to do with microsoft and more a user error
2007-03-07T17:58:00.000Z	techie	ikonia_	I won't argue with your statement.
