2005-06-25T16:19:00.000Z	Codeman7		Hi, I have a problem. my X keeps freezing for a second or so every minute or so... if that makes sense. Pointer and typing just freeze for a second, and then resume.
2005-06-25T16:20:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	Codeman7	: you got a slow pc?
2005-06-25T16:20:00.000Z	Codeman7	lsuactiafner	1.13GHz PIII?
2005-06-25T16:21:00.000Z	Codeman7	lsuactiafner	Ubuntu is running really smoothly and VERY quick, it's just the intermittent freeze that is causing problems.
2005-06-25T16:21:00.000Z	Codeman7	lsuactiafner	Yeah, it's a laptop. I am using the GeForce2 Go drivers, though, which made no difference.
2005-06-25T16:21:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	Codeman7	: what are you doing when it stalls?
2005-06-25T16:21:00.000Z	Codeman7	lsuactiafner	Anything. Sitting at the desktop, using irssi, firefox...
2005-06-25T16:23:00.000Z	Codeman7	lsuactiafner	So what can I do about it?
2005-06-25T16:23:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	Codeman7	: this is terrible but it might work... pgrep -u your_X_user | xargs renice -3
2005-06-25T16:25:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	Codeman7	: did it help?
2005-06-25T16:25:00.000Z	Codeman7	lsuactiafner	I keep getting "setpriority: Permission denied"
2005-06-25T16:26:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	Codeman7	: sudo before the command
2005-06-25T16:26:00.000Z	Codeman7	lsuactiafner	Didn't help
2005-06-25T16:26:00.000Z	Codeman7	lsuactiafner	That is, I did use sudo before it
2005-06-25T16:27:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	Codeman7	: run the command as root, get a root terminal then
2005-06-25T16:27:00.000Z	Codeman7	lsuactiafner	K, that worked.
2005-06-25T16:27:00.000Z	Codeman7	lsuactiafner	Alright, lemme use it for a few minutes and see if anything improved.
2005-06-25T16:29:00.000Z	Codeman7	lsuactiafner	Someone suggested it may have something to do with laptop power management, but didn't know how to turn it off...
2005-06-25T16:29:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	Codeman7	: then as periodically here.. till someone can answer you.. i think its got to do with too-aggressive power management
2005-06-25T16:32:00.000Z	Codeman7	lsuactiafner	Is gnome-terminal, while rug irssi, supposed to use 40-50% cpu?
2005-06-25T16:32:00.000Z	Codeman7	lsuactiafner	And something just jumped up while it froze but I couldn't catch it
