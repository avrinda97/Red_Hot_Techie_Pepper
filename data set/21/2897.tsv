2009-05-20T05:06:00.000Z	tyl3r		Hello. Running Jaunty with gnome on a dell studio xps16 with full hd 1920x1080....anyone has some good tips / links for font optimizing, especially in firefox ?
2009-05-20T05:06:00.000Z	tyl3r		I know this is an issue for many people and I read and try a lot but for firefox I cannot come to a decent solution
2009-05-20T05:07:00.000Z	tyl3r		system fonts are fine actually, but with full hd res, I cannot find any optimal font setting in firefox...
2009-05-20T05:07:00.000Z	TheMoonMaster	tyl3r	I am on an XPS m1130 and going to system->preferences->appearance and then going to the fonts section, choosing details and editing the DPI helps me
2009-05-20T05:08:00.000Z	TheMoonMaster	tyl3r	You install msttcorefonts?
2009-05-20T05:08:00.000Z	tyl3r	TheMoonMaster	thx, how many dpi you have ? In general I would be happy with firefox looking fine on all pages....but for example ubuntuforums look great with one font, with the same font last.fm is ugly and overlaps etc...so hard to find a perfect solution
2009-05-20T05:08:00.000Z	tyl3r	TheMoonMaster	yes installed corefonts
2009-05-20T05:09:00.000Z	tyl3r	TheMoonMaster	do you have option "allow websites to use own fonts" in firefox set?
2009-05-20T05:10:00.000Z	tyl3r	TheMoonMaster	ok. Could you please tell me your fonts used in Firefox / sizes ? Would be nice...
2009-05-20T05:12:00.000Z	tyl3r	TheMoonMaster	ok thx
2009-05-20T05:13:00.000Z	tyl3r	TheMoonMaster	same here, 16
2009-05-20T05:14:00.000Z	tyl3r	TheMoonMaster	will try further with fonts or else maybe with a standard set zoom for all websites in firefox....as websites might still be optimized for lower res these days...will try your posted settings with 16 right now...
2009-05-20T05:17:00.000Z	TheMoonMaster	tyl3r	I looked up the problem and some say that editing your appearance->font->details and setting hinting to none fixes things
2009-05-20T05:20:00.000Z	tyl3r	TheMoonMaster	just tried all, with your font settings in firefox, for example at me the login text overlaps with a formular field...if I go down with font size, its getting too small...so I tried different one, droid, bitstream, etc...still, seems Im unable to find a perfect firefox config that fits on all sites. Sure Im not an expert regarding fonts but I know this is common problem for many people....recently swit
2009-05-20T05:21:00.000Z	TheMoonMaster	tyl3r	did you try appearance->font->details and setting hinting to none?
2009-05-20T05:21:00.000Z	tyl3r	TheMoonMaster	Yes, just did that and restarted firefox
2009-05-20T05:23:00.000Z	tyl3r	TheMoonMaster	Firefox 3.0.10...yes you are right, its a problem related due to my high res....I was fine on 15inch notebooks
2009-05-20T05:24:00.000Z	tyl3r	TheMoonMaster	hmm, I think zoom could help here, small fonts but zoom like ctrl + works and looks fine...maybe you know the setting in firefox responsible for a standard zoom on every webpage set in about:config ?
2009-05-20T05:25:00.000Z	tyl3r	TheMoonMaster	yes, that works, just like to have a standard zoom for every page...but its ok I just google that, thx for your help
2009-05-20T05:27:00.000Z	tyl3r	TheMoonMaster	oh btw., if you have a studio, did you update your bios yet over ubuntu with the dell firmware tools ? seems like they dont post the updates for mine in their repo....and I cannot get a .hdr file from the win packages dell provides
2009-05-20T05:32:00.000Z	tyl3r	TheMoonMaster	fyi, looks better with hinting off
