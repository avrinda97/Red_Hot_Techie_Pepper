2004-11-24T12:56:00.000Z	dablitz		can I get some help trying to shutdown a deamon. I am trying to do an irrecord for lirc, and the system won't let me
2004-11-24T12:56:00.000Z	dablitz		killall just does not seem to work
2004-11-24T12:56:00.000Z	scoon	dablitz	 /etc/init.d/the-name-of-the-daemon stop
2004-11-24T12:56:00.000Z	scoon		orga: yes ?
2004-11-24T12:57:00.000Z	dablitz		did that already
2004-11-24T12:57:00.000Z	dablitz		but when I do an irrecord lircd.conf i cannot seem to get anywhere
2004-11-24T12:57:00.000Z	scoon	dablitz	ps aux | grep daemon-name ?
2004-11-24T12:57:00.000Z	scoon		orga: yes, SCJP
2004-11-24T12:57:00.000Z	scoon		orga: eclipse-3
2004-11-24T12:57:00.000Z	dablitz		i will try that
2004-11-24T12:58:00.000Z	dablitz		ok what am I looking at scoon
2004-11-24T12:58:00.000Z	dablitz		4405  0.0  0.2  1816  556 pts/0    R+   13:58   0:00 grep lircd
2004-11-24T12:58:00.000Z	scoon	dablitz	is that it ?
2004-11-24T12:59:00.000Z	scoon	dablitz	if so that means that the lircd daemon is NOT running
2004-11-24T12:59:00.000Z	dablitz		ok i will now try a irrecord
2004-11-24T12:59:00.000Z	scoon	dablitz	if it were, you would see another line with lircd
2004-11-24T13:00:00.000Z	dablitz	scoon	this is what I get -->>irrecord: could not init hardware (lircd running ? --> close it, check permissions)
2004-11-24T13:01:00.000Z	scoon	dablitz	that is prolly just a suggestion.  look for something else to be wrong.  unfortunately, i have never used lirc.
2004-11-24T13:01:00.000Z	scoon	dablitz	so i won't be that much help to you prolly.
2004-11-24T13:01:00.000Z	dablitz		thanks so far scoon
2004-11-24T13:01:00.000Z	scoon	dablitz	np
