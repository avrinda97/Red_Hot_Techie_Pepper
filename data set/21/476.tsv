2011-12-16T00:04:00.000Z	diatomaceous		help!  My SD card isn't working in ubuntu, but it works fine in my friend's mac.. what can I do?
2011-12-16T00:06:00.000Z	diatomaceous		you'll need to simultaneously change the fstab and the bootloader entries.
2011-12-16T00:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	diatomaceous	Is it a single SD card which isn't working in Ubuntu, or does no SD card work (i.e. it's more likely a problem with the card reader)?
2011-12-16T00:07:00.000Z	diatomaceous	Jordan_U	It's just this card.. my other cards work fine.
2011-12-16T00:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	diatomaceous	Does it use APM (Apple Partition Map)?
2011-12-16T00:08:00.000Z	diatomaceous	Jordan_U	It's typical camera card.. FAT I believe
2011-12-16T00:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	diatomaceous	Possibly exfat?
2011-12-16T00:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	diatomaceous	What filesystem does OSX see it as? (Disk Utility should show you this).
2011-12-16T00:09:00.000Z	diatomaceous	Jordan_U	 I pulled up disk tool to check.. it's FAT16
2011-12-16T00:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	diatomaceous	OK. What type of partition table?
2011-12-16T00:10:00.000Z	diatomaceous		master boot record
2011-12-16T00:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	diatomaceous	OK. Can you insert the SD card and pastebin the output of "sudo parted -l"?
2011-12-16T00:11:00.000Z	diatomaceous		http://pastebin.com/QtrufYnP
2011-12-16T00:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	diatomaceous	Odd, parted doesn't detect any filesystem at all.
2011-12-16T00:13:00.000Z	diatomaceous	Jordan_U	The files and folders come up in nautilus, but they're 0 bytes
2011-12-16T00:14:00.000Z	diatomaceous	Jordan_U	A guide I found online suggested running dosfsck, which says "Logical sector size is zero."
2011-12-16T00:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	diatomaceous	Can you run "sudo umount /dev/mmcblk0p1 && sudo mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt/" and pastebin the output?
2011-12-16T00:15:00.000Z	diatomaceous	Jordan_U	No output
2011-12-16T00:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	diatomaceous	Before you do anything else, if there are files on this SD card which you do not have backups for umount it, move it back to your mac, and back them up.
2011-12-16T00:17:00.000Z	diatomaceous	Jordan_U	I think I agree.. it's just weird that it works fine in other computers but not ubuntu :[
2011-12-16T00:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	diatomaceous	After you've backed up your files see if dosfsck offers to fix the problem.
