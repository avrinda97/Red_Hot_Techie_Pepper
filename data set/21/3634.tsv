2008-11-07T04:39:00.000Z	mhall119		Vista may not be honoring that, I don't know if Wubi works well with Vista or not, I've only ever tried it on XP
2008-11-07T04:39:00.000Z	mhall119		ubiquity is the Ubuntu installer
2008-11-07T04:41:00.000Z	Mias	mhall119	hmm, I clicked away the "installin, plz wait" window to look what "extended" would offer, then I clicked "install" again (pII 350) and nothing seems to happen since 15 mins
2008-11-07T04:42:00.000Z	mhall119	Mias	sorry, what was your question again?
2008-11-07T04:43:00.000Z	Mias	mhall119	is it possible that clicking away this wait-window is harmful to the install process?
2008-11-07T04:44:00.000Z	mhall119	Mias	I really don't know what you're asking, I'm trying to follow too many conversations
2008-11-07T04:44:00.000Z	Mias	mhall119	old chatting-malaise ;}
2008-11-07T04:44:00.000Z	mhall119	Mias	I'm not sure, are you running ubiquity from a liveCD?
2008-11-07T04:45:00.000Z	Mias	mhall119	yes I am
2008-11-07T04:45:00.000Z	mhall119	Mias	what stage is it at?
2008-11-07T04:45:00.000Z	Mias	mhall119	"ready to install"
2008-11-07T04:46:00.000Z	Mias	mhall119	no but I clicked this wait--- away
2008-11-07T04:46:00.000Z	mhall119	Mias	are you re-sizing partitions?
2008-11-07T04:46:00.000Z	Mias	mhall119	no, re-partitioning
2008-11-07T04:48:00.000Z	Mias	mhall119	wiping
2008-11-07T04:48:00.000Z	mhall119	Mias	then I don't know, sorry, reboot and try again I guess
2008-11-07T04:48:00.000Z	Mias	mhall119	maybe this 350 mhz calculator is so slow?
2008-11-07T04:48:00.000Z	mhall119	Mias	that's a possibility too
2008-11-07T04:50:00.000Z	Mias	mhall119	but I should be seeing some kind of mkext3fs or so in top ;(
2008-11-07T04:51:00.000Z	mhall119	Mias	at some point, yes
2008-11-07T04:52:00.000Z	mhall119	Mias	mkext3fs is formatting your drive, if you have a big drive or a slow CPU, it will take a while
