2008-12-11T04:30:00.000Z	Pabremer		I was using Ubuntu 8.04 then I installed Mandriva 2009, but the "mandriva's lilo" did not have the option to Ubuntu so I tried to add Ubuntu in the "lilo.conf" but I failed then when I restarted my computer I cannot access both systems... What can I do to acess Ubuntu again?
2008-12-11T04:31:00.000Z	badawi	Pabremer	mandriva uses grub just like ubuntu, and by default it has "othe linux" selection
2008-12-11T04:32:00.000Z	Pabremer	badawi	ok, but it didn't appear in the grub
2008-12-11T04:33:00.000Z	Pabremer	badawi	instead of conventional grub, is being used Mandriva's grub
2008-12-11T04:33:00.000Z	badawi	Pabremer	is mandriva grub on mbr and ubunt grub on /dev/sda2 or something like that?
2008-12-11T04:34:00.000Z	Pabremer	badawi	i don't know.. i think mandriva is in "sda6" and ubuntu in "sda2" or the contrary
2008-12-11T04:35:00.000Z	Pabremer	badawi	i just wanna backup 8gbs of files in Ubuntu then reinstall only Ubuntu in my hd
2008-12-11T04:35:00.000Z	badawi		!paste
2008-12-11T04:36:00.000Z	badawi	Pabremer	try adding somthing like this in mandriva grub file http://paste.ubuntu.com/83758/
2008-12-11T04:37:00.000Z	badawi	Pabremer	u'll need to play with the values to suit you, the sda2 part and the 1 and 2 number that goes with hd0

2008-12-11T04:39:00.000Z	badawi		!grub | Pabremer
2008-12-11T04:39:00.000Z	Pabremer	badawi	ok, btw... what can i do to see what's my ubuntu and mandriva partition?
2008-12-11T04:39:00.000Z	badawi	Pabremer	and google something called supergrub, it will boot into anything from anything
2008-12-11T04:39:00.000Z	Pabremer	badawi	then i'll create the "way" to ubuntu and mandriva again in grub
2008-12-11T04:41:00.000Z	Pabremer	badawi	i cannot use supergrub because i dont have any cd
