2011-06-09T13:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	deployment	Do you know which of those your BIOS is set to boot from? What is "Virtual_Disk"?
2011-06-09T13:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	deployment	"morror array"?
2011-06-09T13:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	deployment	Ahh, "mirror".
2011-06-09T13:07:00.000Z	deployment	Jordan_U	should I pick that one?
2011-06-09T13:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	deployment	It depends. What is you BIOS set to boot from?
2011-06-09T13:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	deployment	Is the external drive just a data drive?
2011-06-09T13:10:00.000Z	deployment	Jordan_U	Yeh
2011-06-09T13:11:00.000Z	deployment	Jordan_U	On my ubuntu HDD i have just noticed i don't have a swap drive or anything. I only have the one partition, is this an issue?
2011-06-09T13:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	deployment	Then I would select both "sda" and "sdb", that way it will work no matter what your BIOS boots from. Do *not* select any partitions.
2011-06-09T13:12:00.000Z	deployment	Jordan_U	OK
2011-06-09T13:12:00.000Z	deployment	Jordan_U	On my ubuntu HDD i have just noticed i don't have a swap drive or anything. I only have the one partition, is this an issue? -- in general..
2011-06-09T13:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	deployment	It depends on how you use your computer.

2011-06-09T13:19:00.000Z	deployment	Jordan_U	Is this type of this ok without the other linux partitions?
