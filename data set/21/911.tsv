2011-04-19T12:18:00.000Z	karel_ff		It this the right place for getting help with creating .deb files?
2011-04-19T12:18:00.000Z	iceroot	karel_ff	sure
2011-04-19T12:19:00.000Z	iceroot	karel_ff	yes, thats the structure of a deb-file
2011-04-19T12:20:00.000Z	iceroot	karel_ff	one changelog/versionnumber is enough
2011-04-19T12:22:00.000Z	karel_ff	iceroot	I think I will get complaints later on when deploying the package with reprepro. let me check
2011-04-19T12:22:00.000Z	iceroot	karel_ff	remeber if you are testing your package, use pbuilder with chroot and not dpkg-buildpackage
2011-04-19T12:23:00.000Z	karel_ff	iceroot	now you're going to fast for me :) I'm using debuild, but I'm not sure what it's relation is with pbuilder or dpkg-buildpackage
2011-04-19T12:24:00.000Z	iceroot	karel_ff	i guess you have build-depends in your package? ( debian/control)
2011-04-19T12:28:00.000Z	iceroot	karel_ff	ok, the problem is (general) if you dont set the build-depends correctly (e.g. you need unzip) your package will only build successfull if on the system unzip is installed. because of that, packages are build in a chroot with no packages installed by default. the build-process is installing all packages from your kbuild-depends line and tries to build the package, if you have something forgot in your build-depends which y
2011-04-19T12:28:00.000Z	iceroot	karel_ff	i hope this explenation was not to bad :)
2011-04-19T12:28:00.000Z	karel_ff	iceroot	still chewing on it :)
2011-04-19T12:29:00.000Z	karel_ff	iceroot	removing 'maverick' from the changelog entry gives this error: parsechangelog/debian: error: fatal error occured while parsing input
2011-04-19T12:29:00.000Z	karel_ff	iceroot	trying with Build-Depends: pbuilder now
2011-04-19T12:30:00.000Z	iceroot	karel_ff	always use debchange for working in debian/changelog
2011-04-19T12:30:00.000Z	iceroot	karel_ff	pbuilder is not a build-dependency, pbuilder is a build-process using chroot

2011-04-19T12:31:00.000Z	karel_ff	iceroot	I'll start reading... much stuff to learn :)
2011-04-19T12:31:00.000Z	iceroot	karel_ff	in my opinion pbuilder is the best way to have clean and good packages
2011-04-19T12:32:00.000Z	karel_ff	iceroot	thx for the tips :)
2011-04-19T12:32:00.000Z	iceroot	karel_ff	you can also set chroot for lucid,maverick, lenny, sid and so on. so you are using the packages (dependencies from that version)
2011-04-19T12:59:00.000Z	karel_ff	iceroot	I'm not sure if pbuilder is going to help much... my package only contains python code, so I doubt that any build problems are going to be detected.
