2011-03-05T00:10:00.000Z	hdd_crash		how to make a hdd to be recognized if it's not?
2011-03-05T00:10:00.000Z	hdd_crash		need help
2011-03-05T00:12:00.000Z	HF_acid	hdd_crash	specifics?  eg does it not show up if you sudo fdisk -l   ?
2011-03-05T00:16:00.000Z	HF_acid	hdd_crash	did you try running the terminal command I gave you earlier?
2011-03-05T00:16:00.000Z	hdd_crash	HF_acid	which one?
2011-03-05T00:17:00.000Z	HF_acid	hdd_crash	sudo fdisk -l   (that's L not i)
2011-03-05T00:18:00.000Z	hdd_crash	HF_acid	??
2011-03-05T00:20:00.000Z	hdd_crash	HF_acid	yes the HDD doesnt show up with fdisk -l
2011-03-05T00:25:00.000Z	HF_acid	hdd_crash	well if it's not showing up with the fdisk command that shows ubuntu isn't detecting it (obviously you know that).  Have you ruled out hard drive failure?
2011-03-05T00:25:00.000Z	hdd_crash	HF_acid	well it must be broken or sumping
2011-03-05T00:26:00.000Z	HF_acid	hdd_crash	any chance you could test it on another computer?
2011-03-05T00:26:00.000Z	hdd_crash	HF_acid	i have tried on mac and windows different computers
2011-03-05T00:31:00.000Z	HF_acid	hdd_crash	that's not a reassuring sign. but I'm interested in seeing what Dr_Willis 's suggestion gives you
2011-03-05T00:38:00.000Z	HF_acid	hdd_crash	at this point I'd say hard drive failure is a likely culprit
