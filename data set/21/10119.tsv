2005-05-22T09:28:00.000Z	MuStR		I have a q
2005-05-22T09:29:00.000Z	MuStR		if I make a new swap space partition, will ubuntu automatically use it?
2005-05-22T09:29:00.000Z	MuStR		anyone know about swap space~?
2005-05-22T09:30:00.000Z	MuStR		it's libgstreamer something
2005-05-22T09:30:00.000Z	MuStR		I guess no one knows anything about swap space, eh?
2005-05-22T09:31:00.000Z	g14	MuStR	Make a swap partition as big as the amount of ram in your computer
2005-05-22T09:31:00.000Z	g14	MuStR	because it will just slow down the computer
2005-05-22T09:32:00.000Z	g14	MuStR	swapping is bad. It is only used when the ram is full
2005-05-22T09:32:00.000Z	g14	MuStR	and it is very slow because the harddrive is slow compared to ram
2005-05-22T09:34:00.000Z	g14	MuStR	with older machines, you made the swap partition twice as big as the amount of ram. With newer machines you make it equal. That is standard practice
2005-05-22T09:35:00.000Z	g14	MuStR	no
2005-05-22T09:35:00.000Z	g14	MuStR	I can help you set it up though, its really easy to edit the fstab
2005-05-22T09:35:00.000Z	g14	MuStR	What kind of partiton is it?
2005-05-22T09:36:00.000Z	g14	MuStR	create the partition, create a mount point (empty directory), and then add it to your /etc/fstab
2005-05-22T09:37:00.000Z	g14	MuStR	no problem
2005-05-22T10:55:00.000Z	MuStR	g14	how do I mount my swap?
2005-05-22T10:57:00.000Z	g14	MuStR	 replace hda2 with whatever your swap partition is in your /etc/fstab file: /dev/hda2       none            swap    sw              0       0
2005-05-22T10:58:00.000Z	g14	MuStR	just put tabs between everything
2005-05-22T10:58:00.000Z	MuStR	g14	my swap is hda6....
2005-05-22T10:59:00.000Z	g14	MuStR	yep
2005-05-22T11:10:00.000Z	g14	MuStR	no problem
