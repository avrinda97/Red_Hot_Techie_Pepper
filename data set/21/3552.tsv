2011-11-06T20:33:00.000Z	LargePrime		anyone give me a hand with openssh?
2011-11-06T20:34:00.000Z	LargePrime		please?
2011-11-06T20:35:00.000Z	LargePrime		I am using putty to connect to a ubuntu maching using ssh
2011-11-06T20:36:00.000Z	LargePrime		I cannot get teh RSA kays to work
2011-11-06T20:36:00.000Z	LargePrime		the* keys*
2011-11-06T20:36:00.000Z	LargePrime		So i am looking for the format of the sshd authorized keys file
2011-11-06T20:37:00.000Z	bekks	LargePrime	ssh-keygen -t rsa on the client, then copy the content of the .pub key into the file user@server:/home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys
2011-11-06T20:38:00.000Z	LargePrime	bekks	I edited the sshd_config to have "AuthorizedKeysFile /etc/ssh/authorized_keys"
2011-11-06T20:38:00.000Z	LargePrime		and put the file there
2011-11-06T20:40:00.000Z	LargePrime		then I used puttygen to create the contents  bekks
2011-11-06T20:40:00.000Z	bekks	LargePrime	You dont have to edit the sshd_config of Ubuntu to get that working. And it doesnt matter how you generated the public key file.
2011-11-06T20:44:00.000Z	LargePrime	bekks	puttygen maked publick key files with a very different format than openssh expects
2011-11-06T20:44:00.000Z	LargePrime		makes* public*
2011-11-06T20:44:00.000Z	bekks		No.
2011-11-06T20:45:00.000Z	bekks		Thats entirely wrong, since exactly that setups works on about 60 windows clients here.
2011-11-06T20:46:00.000Z	LargePrime		when I open teh puttygen in a text editor it says
2011-11-06T20:46:00.000Z	LargePrime		---- BEGIN SSH2 PUBLIC KEY ----
2011-11-06T20:46:00.000Z	LargePrime		Comment: "rsa-key-20111105"
2011-11-06T20:46:00.000Z	LargePrime		AA
2011-11-06T20:46:00.000Z	LargePrime		pubs gennereated with open ssh has only a "ssh-rsa" on the first line
2011-11-06T20:50:00.000Z	LargePrime	bekks	have you got a link to a guide to set up a putty to openssh in ubuntu link?
