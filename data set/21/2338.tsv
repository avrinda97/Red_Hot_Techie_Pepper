2009-11-15T12:10:00.000Z	cowbud	fooj	go to the url and paste the output there then give me the link
2009-11-15T12:10:00.000Z	fooj	cowbud	ok
2009-11-15T12:12:00.000Z	fooj	cowbud	http://paste.ubuntu.com/319100/
2009-11-15T12:13:00.000Z	cowbud	fooj	and it isn't running after that? like you can't mysql -u root -p <ENTER> ?
2009-11-15T12:14:00.000Z	fooj	cowbud	yes ,and i checked there is no mysql.pid in /var/run/mysqld/
2009-11-15T12:15:00.000Z	cowbud	fooj	look in /var/log/daemon.log and see what the error is..
2009-11-15T12:17:00.000Z	fooj	cowbud	i can not find /var/log/daemon.log
2009-11-15T12:17:00.000Z	cowbud	fooj	permission denied?
2009-11-15T12:17:00.000Z	cowbud	fooj	you have to look at it as root
2009-11-15T12:17:00.000Z	fooj	cowbud	there is no daemon.log in /var/log
2009-11-15T12:18:00.000Z	cowbud	fooj	that is strange and kinda unbelievable
2009-11-15T12:18:00.000Z	fooj	cowbud	i use ubuntu 9.10
2009-11-15T12:19:00.000Z	cowbud	fooj	ok, apt-get install mysql-server
2009-11-15T12:30:00.000Z	fooj	cowbud	i must find the why, because i do accomplish in redhat with the same method
2009-11-15T12:31:00.000Z	cowbud	fooj	without any logs it is hard to help
2009-11-15T12:36:00.000Z	fooj	cowbud	thank you for your help after all~
2009-11-15T12:37:00.000Z	cowbud	fooj	without logs unfortunately it isn't really something that can be diagnosed, the only other thing I can think of is your compiled version is dumping logs somewhere else what happens when you call mysqld directly?
