2005-09-16T07:30:00.000Z	gorilla	cobhcf	did you check the md5 checksum of the iso that you have?
2005-09-16T07:31:00.000Z	cobhcf	gorilla	nope
2005-09-16T07:31:00.000Z	gorilla	cobhcf	if the image is corrupted when you downloaded it, then you won't have a chance to install from it when burnt onto a cd.
