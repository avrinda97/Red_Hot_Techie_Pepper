2007-06-18T05:13:00.000Z	Sepero	wols	I need a copy of the module for that modem. That is all.
2007-06-18T05:15:00.000Z	wols	Sepero	http://www.linmodems.org/
2007-06-18T05:16:00.000Z	Sepero	wols	No thanks. That site isn't going to help me.
2007-06-18T05:16:00.000Z	wols	Sepero	why not?
2007-06-18T05:17:00.000Z	wols	Sepero	it has a link to the drive you need
2007-06-18T05:17:00.000Z	Sepero	wols	Because I need the driver precompiled for a kernel that I'm not using.
2007-06-18T05:17:00.000Z	wols	Sepero	you can cimpile drivers for another kernel (as long as you have headers for the kernel)
2007-06-18T05:18:00.000Z	Sepero	wols	Unfortunalely, with the 536, it will not compile unless you are actually using that kernel.
2007-06-18T05:19:00.000Z	wols	Sepero	no. as long as you hand it the proper files (headers mostly) it will compile
2007-06-18T05:19:00.000Z	Sepero	wols	I've tried it before. Trust me, it doesn't work.
2007-06-29T13:41:00.000Z	wols	Sepero	grep is part of base isntall. always needed :)
2007-06-29T13:42:00.000Z	Sepero	wols	Yeah, but grep even beats perl :)
2007-06-29T13:44:00.000Z	Sepero	wols	grep beat out dpkg by over 50 votes. lol
2007-06-29T13:58:00.000Z	wols	Sepero	he's been helped a long time ago. but he'd rather whine about his treatment. please don't feed him
2007-06-29T14:00:00.000Z	wols	Sepero	ubotu's "father" is either dpkg or it's a customized blootbot
2007-06-29T14:01:00.000Z	wols	Sepero	dpkg being the bot of that name in #debian
2007-06-29T14:01:00.000Z	Sepero	wols	gotcha
2007-06-29T14:05:00.000Z	wols	Sepero	I said !ops | <text>
2007-06-29T14:05:00.000Z	Sepero	wols	Gotcha
