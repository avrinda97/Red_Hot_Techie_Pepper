2007-12-17T06:24:00.000Z	Slart	amitprakash	you lost your root password? or your user password?
2007-12-17T06:24:00.000Z	amitprakash	Slart	root
2007-12-17T06:24:00.000Z	Slart	amitprakash	surely you're not running as root?
2007-12-17T06:25:00.000Z	amitprakash	Slart	yes i am :(
2007-12-17T06:25:00.000Z	Slart	amitprakash	well.. let's just look past the whole "running stuff as root is bad"-issue.. you're supposed to be able to reset it

2007-12-17T06:27:00.000Z	Slart	amitprakash	ikonia speaks the harsh truth here.. I'd reinstall too
2007-12-17T06:28:00.000Z	amitprakash	Slart	well i have a lot of packages on it.. and i cant reallydownload them all again
2007-12-17T06:29:00.000Z	Slart	amitprakash	well.. then get commercial help.. or buy lots of pizza for your local linux-geek =)
2007-12-17T06:34:00.000Z	amitprakash	Slart	ikonia is it possible to find out what all do i have installed on this screwed up system?
2007-12-17T06:42:00.000Z	amitprakash	Slart	yay.. recoving linux stepwise :D
2007-12-17T06:44:00.000Z	Slart	amitprakash	you're getting it fixed? nice
