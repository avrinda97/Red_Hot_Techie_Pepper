2006-06-05T09:34:00.000Z	anfangs		hallo all
2006-06-05T09:35:00.000Z	anfangs		will I run into conflicts if I try to install KDE when gnome is already my default dm?
2006-06-05T09:35:00.000Z	troy_s	anfangs	 no you shouldn't.
2006-06-05T09:35:00.000Z	troy_s	anfangs	 kde-desktop -- then choose your session.
2006-06-05T09:35:00.000Z	anfangs	troy_s	ok, cool..
2006-06-05T09:49:00.000Z	troy_s	anfangs	 sounds suspect
2006-06-05T11:55:00.000Z	troy_s	anfangs	 use ssh.
2006-06-05T11:55:00.000Z	troy_s	anfangs	 takes about six seconds to setup on ubuntu if you want a server on it.  slightly more if you use winblows.
2006-06-05T11:59:00.000Z	anfangs	troy_s	ill look into ssh, ive hear of it before, seems like it would be useful for a lot of things.
2006-06-05T11:59:00.000Z	troy_s	anfangs	 it is brother.  it is awsome work.
2006-06-05T12:00:00.000Z	troy_s	anfangs	 you can remote x apps thru it, share files securely, remotely administer a box, etc... all through ONE port
2006-06-05T12:00:00.000Z	troy_s	anfangs	 and it is one of the most securely written daemons out there.
2006-06-05T12:02:00.000Z	anfangs	troy_s	and i can connect from windows 2k? would this be thru telnet or should i use some other app?
2006-06-05T12:02:00.000Z	troy_s	anfangs	 of course
2006-06-05T12:02:00.000Z	troy_s	anfangs	 and you can use a graphical app if need be -- winscp does files.
2006-06-05T12:02:00.000Z	anfangs	troy_s	srry ;) meant to refer to ssh
2006-06-05T12:02:00.000Z	troy_s	anfangs	 free too.  but only really trust the stuff from openbsd's team if you want complete security -- meaning scp etc.
2006-06-05T12:03:00.000Z	troy_s	anfangs	 winscp uses ssh
2006-06-05T12:03:00.000Z	troy_s	anfangs	 just a graphical interface into scp
2006-06-05T12:03:00.000Z	troy_s	anfangs	 ssh is the defacto tool for all your networking needs.
2006-06-05T12:04:00.000Z	troy_s	anfangs	 it really is the only choice if you want to keep everything secure.
