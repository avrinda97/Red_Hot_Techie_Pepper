2010-08-02T04:06:00.000Z	wthpr0		Wissman: yes but i got the without buying them :)
2010-08-02T04:07:00.000Z	wthpr0		but... do you think the isps dhcp server looks for only valide mac adresses ?
2010-08-02T04:08:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	wthpr0	 the ISP's dhcp server doesnt care about your system's MAC address
2010-08-02T04:08:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	wthpr0	 if you're behind a router, it sees the router
2010-08-02T04:08:00.000Z	wthpr0		yes i know :P but the linux box is the router :P
2010-08-02T04:09:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	wthpr0	 then the linux box should assign INTERNAL NETWORK IPs, such as 192.168.1.somethign to each system
2010-08-02T04:09:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	wthpr0	 then each individual system has access to the ONE IP sent to your box
2010-08-02T04:09:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix		er router box
2010-08-02T04:09:00.000Z	wthpr0		EvilPhenix: yes it dose ...
2010-08-02T04:09:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	wthpr0	 in essence...
2010-08-02T04:09:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	wthpr0	 your ISP NEVER SHOULD SEE the MAC address for the individual systems on your network
2010-08-02T04:10:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	wthpr0	 it will ONLY SEE the router box you have
2010-08-02T04:10:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	wthpr0	 so the other 5 IPs you have need to be set by networking settings
2010-08-02T04:10:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	wthpr0	 or by individual connections nto your ISP
2010-08-02T04:10:00.000Z	wthpr0		EvilPhenix: but i want to have another live ip and the i need to change the ip of my router and that is why i want to change the mac adress on the ubuntubox so that the isps dhcp server gives me a new ip
2010-08-02T04:10:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	wthpr0	 you can't change the MAC address
2010-08-02T04:11:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	wthpr0	 you PHYSICALLY CANNOT CHANGE the MAC address
2010-08-02T04:11:00.000Z	wthpr0	EvilPhoenix	you sure ? you can under windows
2010-08-02T04:11:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	wthpr0	 you can try and SPOOF a different Mac address
2010-08-02T04:11:00.000Z	EvilPhoenix	wthpr0	 but you can't physically change the MAC address burned into the NIC
