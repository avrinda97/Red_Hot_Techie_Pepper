2008-12-30T10:02:00.000Z	Cpudan80		maybe press esc or spacebar or something ?
2008-12-30T10:03:00.000Z	Cpudan80		See if that works
2008-12-30T10:03:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Cpudan80	I believe his Ubuntu hasn't actually booted properly once... then he would only have 1 kernel
2008-12-30T10:04:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Cpudan80	 Wait, he tinkered with his PC... Anyone involved changing of video cards?
2008-12-30T10:04:00.000Z	Cpudan80	WebcamWonder	yes - he swapped the vid card
2008-12-30T10:04:00.000Z	Cpudan80	WebcamWonder	but he cant get to a terminal to rerun the nvidia-xconfig
2008-12-30T10:04:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Cpudan80	And did he happen to have the propietary drivers enabled before he did the swap?
2008-12-30T10:05:00.000Z	Cpudan80	WebcamWonder	we'll have to ask him :-)
2008-12-30T10:05:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Cpudan80	;)
2008-12-30T10:07:00.000Z	Cpudan80	WebcamWonder	Im willing to bet it was enabled
2008-12-30T10:07:00.000Z	Cpudan80	WebcamWonder	and the solution is .......
2008-12-30T10:07:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Cpudan80	Yes, and nVidia drivers are attempting to load on an ATI card
2008-12-30T10:12:00.000Z	Cpudan80	WebcamWonder	it should just give you a prompt in recovery mode
2008-12-30T10:12:00.000Z	Cpudan80	WebcamWonder	he should just be able to do dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg from there
2008-12-30T10:12:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Cpudan80	Yeah... but I don't remmeber the options at all... completely blank here
2008-12-30T10:12:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Cpudan80	And google won't turn up anything either
2008-12-30T10:12:00.000Z	Cpudan80	WebcamWonder	what do you mean all the options?
2008-12-30T10:13:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Cpudan80	You are presented with a list of options when you into recovery mode, xserver-reconfigure, dpkg, etc...
2008-12-30T10:13:00.000Z	Cpudan80	WebcamWonder	oh right right I forgot about that
2008-12-30T10:13:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	Cpudan80	Hardly... I am a noob by all standards :P
