2011-07-27T18:20:00.000Z	JonathanLima		could someone give me a hand at permissioning a svn repository?
2011-07-27T18:20:00.000Z	iceroot	JonathanLima	#svn
2011-07-27T18:21:00.000Z	JonathanLima	iceroot	i think it´s actually a permission problem... and not svn problem
2011-07-27T18:21:00.000Z	iceroot	JonathanLima	file permission or svn-repo permission?
2011-07-27T18:22:00.000Z	iceroot		!upgrade | wonderwal
2011-07-27T18:22:00.000Z	JonathanLima	iceroot	file permission
2011-07-27T18:23:00.000Z	JonathanLima	iceroot	file permission from the files that are the repo, actually
2011-07-27T18:24:00.000Z	iceroot	JonathanLima	and what issue exactly? who is the owner? subversion is running as "svn"?
2011-07-27T18:24:00.000Z	JonathanLima	iceroot	i keep getting: Can't open file '/var/local/portalJP/db/txn-current-lock': Permission denied, when i try to commit anything... even tho i have permission on that file
2011-07-27T18:24:00.000Z	iceroot	JonathanLima	svn must have permissions, not you
2011-07-27T18:24:00.000Z	JonathanLima	iceroot	subversion is running as root, the owner is svn:svn... and my user belongs to svn group... permissions are set 775
2011-07-27T18:25:00.000Z	iceroot	JonathanLima	never ever!!! run svn as root
2011-07-27T18:25:00.000Z	JonathanLima	iceroot	it´s just a local server
2011-07-27T18:25:00.000Z	iceroot	JonathanLima	doesnt matter
2011-07-27T18:26:00.000Z	JonathanLima	iceroot	ok, i´m already running it from svn user
2011-07-27T18:29:00.000Z	JonathanLima	iceroot	any ideas what could be?
2011-07-27T18:34:00.000Z	iceroot	JonathanLima	can you paste the permission of that file please
2011-07-27T18:38:00.000Z	JonathanLima	iceroot	sorry for the delay... it´s -rwxrwxr-x 1 svn svn 0
2011-07-27T18:40:00.000Z	iceroot	JonathanLima	strange, even svn should write into that
2011-07-27T18:40:00.000Z	JonathanLima	iceroot	i know... that´s why i came here to ask
2011-07-27T18:41:00.000Z	JonathanLima	iceroot	is there a way to log the file´s access? maybe it´s not using svn´s user?
