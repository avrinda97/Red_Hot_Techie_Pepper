2009-12-21T10:15:00.000Z	dukz		i'm having trouble with network manager. What should a route look like?
2009-12-21T10:16:00.000Z	alankila	dukz	a declaration of gateway address for reaching certain network or host?
2009-12-21T10:16:00.000Z	dukz	alankila	hehe wait... im putting mine on pastebin
2009-12-21T10:24:00.000Z	dukz		hey guys. Help with network-manager. I seem to be having trouble with my route output whenver I use a certain IP
2009-12-21T10:24:00.000Z	dukz		http://pastebin.com/m2eba9728 <==== this is the route output
2009-12-21T10:25:00.000Z	dukz		when i use a 192.168.10.50, the route goes crazy, I can ping internally, but can't get out of the network. But when I use a 192.168.10.60, everything seems to be fine.
2009-12-21T10:26:00.000Z	dukz		I didnt have this problem last week. and I need my ip to be 10.50 since i've already setup my NAT, etc.
2009-12-21T10:26:00.000Z	dukz		any suggestions?
2009-12-21T10:26:00.000Z	alankila	dukz	what do you mean by "when I use 192.168.10.50". These are two different machines?
2009-12-21T10:27:00.000Z	alankila	dukz	the problem with the .50 is that the default route points to localhost instead of 192.168.10.2.
2009-12-21T10:27:00.000Z	dukz	alankila	same machine. I just edited the IP in network manager.
2009-12-21T10:27:00.000Z	dukz	alankila	That's right. My default gw should be 192.168.10.2 (that's our firewall).
2009-12-21T10:27:00.000Z	alankila	dukz	aha. Hmm. I don't know why that would happen, though, but the gateway is wrong, maybe you can somehow force it correct.
2009-12-21T10:28:00.000Z	alankila	dukz	oh wait, I said wrong way ... .60 is the one with localhost as gateway...
2009-12-21T10:29:00.000Z	dukz	alankila	alankila, actually, it's the correct gateway. That's why I find it weird that when I set it to 10.60, it has a localhost gateway, but it can connect to the internet. but the one with 10.50 cannot
2009-12-21T10:30:00.000Z	alankila	dukz	I agree. It is the first time I see something like this -- I have no idea how your symptoms can happen. Linux should not be capable of routing the packets correctly when it sets itself as the gateway.
2009-12-21T10:31:00.000Z	dukz	alankila	yeah i know. it wasnt like this before, and i was wondering about it when i got here this mroning
2009-12-21T10:31:00.000Z	dukz		ugh
2009-12-21T10:32:00.000Z	dukz		can't even traceroute
2009-12-21T10:36:00.000Z	alankila	dukz	check out if iptables nat and normal chains are empty when the localhost gateway is in use. Maybe there's some super weird netfilter setup
2009-12-21T10:36:00.000Z	alankila	dukz	that's all I can think of
