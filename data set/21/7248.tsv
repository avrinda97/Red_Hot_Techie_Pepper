2007-01-04T16:51:00.000Z	Tenen		well like i wish to compile kismet and shit like that, so i must visit that url?
2007-01-04T16:52:00.000Z	ademan	Tenen	why do you want to compile it yourself?
2007-01-04T16:54:00.000Z	ademan	Tenen	go to system->administration->synaptic package manager, from there you can install many many programs
2007-01-04T16:54:00.000Z	ademan	Tenen	hrm, that makes it harder
2007-01-04T16:56:00.000Z	ademan	Tenen	on ubuntu software that you install is stored in packages, these packages are kept on a special server called a repository.  You can install software from repositories through system->administration->synaptic package manager, or from the command line
2007-01-04T16:58:00.000Z	ademan	Tenen	a better bet would be to get the packages off of a repository with your internet enabled computer, burn them to a cd or thumb drive or whatever, bring them over to your linux box and install.   *.tar.gz are not encouraged
2007-01-04T16:59:00.000Z	ademan	Tenen	do which part?
2007-01-04T17:00:00.000Z	ademan	Tenen	you don't install tar.gz, you install packages...
2007-01-04T17:02:00.000Z	ademan	Tenen	ubuntu.com, lemme grab you the direct link
2007-01-04T17:03:00.000Z	ademan	Tenen	you shouldn't be touching a *.tar.gz at all
2007-01-04T17:05:00.000Z	ademan	Tenen	http://packages.ubuntu.com/edgy/net/kismet   get the *.deb from there, transfer it by whatever means over to your linux box, double click it to install
2007-01-04T17:08:00.000Z	ademan	Tenen	no you can, but it seems kismet requires other packages
2007-01-04T17:08:00.000Z	ademan	Tenen	is it possible to just transfer your internet connection to your ubuntu box for a bit?  This would be solved with one command if you were connected
2007-01-04T17:10:00.000Z	ademan	Tenen	well after you get all of the dependancies, you'd install all of them, then the kismet package, to install a package you'd just have to double click on it and hit install.  The only problem is, some of kismet's dependancies might have more dependancies.  That's the beauty of synaptic, it handles all that for you, it downloads all of the required files and installs them all.
2007-01-04T17:11:00.000Z	ademan	Tenen	for example if you decided to install kismet through synaptic, it would go and download all of the dependancies for kismet, install them, then install kismet, all automatically
2007-01-04T17:12:00.000Z	ademan	Tenen	literally, if you had a net connection you would have been done about an hour ago :-) and i'm pretty sure we haven't been working that long
2007-01-04T17:12:00.000Z	ademan	Tenen	i'll brb for a sec though
