2010-03-07T23:41:00.000Z	greezmunkey	spudulike	if you entirely remove it, then it becomes eligable for management by MN, you can then uncheck it in NM, and viola!
2010-03-07T23:42:00.000Z	greezmunkey	spudulike	or you could shut it down from the command line, e.g. sudu ifdown {interface}
2010-03-07T23:43:00.000Z	spudulike	greezmunkey	I'd like it to be auto disabled at startup
2010-03-07T23:43:00.000Z	greezmunkey	spudulike	add the ifdown command to a script that is executed when you log in.
2010-03-07T23:44:00.000Z	spudulike	greezmunkey	hmm, yes, that's a good suggestion.  I just hoped there would be a way in the interfaces file
2010-03-07T23:44:00.000Z	greezmunkey	spudulike	the interfaces file is for affecting the attributes of an interface, not whether is up or down
2010-03-07T23:46:00.000Z	spudulike	greezmunkey	do you know what actually causes the interface to come up?
2010-03-07T23:47:00.000Z	greezmunkey	spudulike	in your rc scripts, I believe.
2010-03-07T23:47:00.000Z	spudulike	greezmunkey	thanks for your advice on that
2010-03-07T23:48:00.000Z	greezmunkey	spudulike	Well, yes. Do you want the interface down all of the time?
2010-03-07T23:48:00.000Z	spudulike	greezmunkey	yes
2010-03-07T23:48:00.000Z	greezmunkey	spudulike	Can you remove the interface?
2010-03-07T23:48:00.000Z	greezmunkey	spudulike	then the workaround isn't such a workaround!
2010-03-07T23:49:00.000Z	greezmunkey	spudulike	your system is going to try to use any hardware that you have drivers for, and some that you don't. So , disable it at log in.
2010-03-07T23:51:00.000Z	greezmunkey	spudulike	you said you have CLI only so xorg.conf shouldn't be in play. Look in your .profile file in you user home directory.

2010-03-07T23:54:00.000Z	greezmunkey	spudulike	I spoke too soon, let me check somewhere else!
2010-03-07T23:57:00.000Z	greezmunkey	spudulike	This is way better: http://www.faqs.org/docs/Linux-HOWTO/Keyboard-and-Console-HOWTO.html
2010-03-08T00:22:00.000Z	spudulike	greezmunkey	thanks for the help earlier - most kind!
2010-03-08T00:22:00.000Z	greezmunkey	spudulike	worked for you?
2010-03-08T00:26:00.000Z	greezmunkey	spudulike	Ctrl+option ??
