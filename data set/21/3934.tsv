2008-08-18T06:02:00.000Z	R_YoYo_R		i just installed ubuntu for the first time in years
2008-08-18T06:03:00.000Z	carandraug	R_YoYo_R	welcome. Hope you enjoy ubuntu and stay for a long time
2008-08-18T06:04:00.000Z	R_YoYo_R	carandraug	well i got fed up with gentoo.
2008-08-18T06:05:00.000Z	carandraug	R_YoYo_R	yeah. All that compiling can be quite tiresome
2008-08-18T06:15:00.000Z	R_YoYo_R	carandraug	it is really good
2008-08-18T06:16:00.000Z	carandraug	R_YoYo_R	hei, have you ever tried Arch? Most people that use Gentoo it's because everything looks so clean but they eventually get tired of compilling everything
2008-08-18T06:17:00.000Z	R_YoYo_R	carandraug	tried arch. ... gentoo is awesome. I love it. But its not compiling.....its compiling with all the right flags and tags to make everything work....i dont have the time
2008-08-18T06:21:00.000Z	carandraug	R_YoYo_R	and did you thought about Arch? I'm experimenting with it in my other computer and I'm really enjoying it. What's the cons with it in your opinion?
2008-08-18T06:22:00.000Z	R_YoYo_R	carandraug	well when i tried it it was still in its early stages. so.... and i think the reason i stopped using it was cause of bugs ....but its most likely much better now
2008-08-21T07:02:00.000Z	carandraug	R_YoYo_R	yes. System>Administration >Login Window
2008-08-21T07:02:00.000Z	R_YoYo_R	carandraug	i found like the bongo sound....i wanted to change the sound once gnome is loaded
2008-08-21T07:02:00.000Z	carandraug	R_YoYo_R	at least in 7.10 that's the way. Search under the Accesibility tab
2008-08-21T07:03:00.000Z	carandraug	R_YoYo_R	hmm, maybe gconf?
2008-08-21T07:03:00.000Z	R_YoYo_R	carandraug	the file is login.wav
2008-08-21T07:03:00.000Z	R_YoYo_R	carandraug	but i cant figure out where it is set
2008-08-21T07:04:00.000Z	carandraug	R_YoYo_R	run gconf-editor in the terminal
2008-08-21T07:04:00.000Z	carandraug	R_YoYo_R	it's easier to search for it there than in the folder with so many files
2008-08-21T07:04:00.000Z	R_YoYo_R	carandraug	i know what your talking about
2008-08-21T07:05:00.000Z	R_YoYo_R	carandraug	i will look
2008-08-21T07:09:00.000Z	R_YoYo_R	carandraug	http://www.foogazi.com/2008/06/29/disable-login-and-logout-sound-on-ubuntu/
2008-08-21T08:34:00.000Z	R_YoYo_R	carandraug	he wants desktops on the top and bottom of the cube
