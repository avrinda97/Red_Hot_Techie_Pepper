2007-12-13T23:47:00.000Z	awjrichards		hi everyone - im using ubuntu 7.10, and just started having a really messed up issue.  i updated libcairo2 and libcairo2-dev packages this morning, and then started getting this error whenever i start a mozilla product: "could not initialize the browser's security component.  the most likely cause is problems with files in your browser's profile directory.  etc."  i tried all the answers i could find in googing the issue
2007-12-13T23:47:00.000Z	awjrichards		 - but to no avail.  i get ssl errors with every browser i've tried, as well as with thunderbird
2007-12-13T23:47:00.000Z	awjrichards		i've tried reinstalling firefox as well as openssl as well as reverting to earlier versions of libcairo (although i have no idea why this would be the problem...)
2007-12-13T23:48:00.000Z	awjrichards		does anyone have any thoughts?
2007-12-13T23:48:00.000Z	ompaul	awjrichards	when you say you updated it - how was it within ubuntu i.e. security updates
2007-12-13T23:48:00.000Z	awjrichards	ompaul	- that's correct
2007-12-13T23:48:00.000Z	awjrichards	ompaul	- it was an automatic update
2007-12-13T23:48:00.000Z	ompaul	awjrichards	have you restarted your gnome session since?
2007-12-13T23:48:00.000Z	awjrichards	ompaul	- i have
2007-12-13T23:49:00.000Z	ompaul	awjrichards	do this in a terminal, sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade
2007-12-13T23:49:00.000Z	awjrichards	ompaul	- done.  nothing to upgrade
2007-12-13T23:49:00.000Z	ompaul	awjrichards	I have to leave in 5 mins so please do this now and let me know how you get on
2007-12-13T23:49:00.000Z	ompaul	awjrichards	right reboot
2007-12-13T23:52:00.000Z	awjrichards	ompaul	- same problem.
2007-12-13T23:52:00.000Z	ompaul	awjrichards	then I suppose the issue is something else, I guess you got some piece of hardware that choose this moment in history to make an impression on you, pretty hard luck if you ask me.
2007-12-13T23:52:00.000Z	awjrichards	ompaul	- you think it's probably hardware related?  perhaps bad blocks in the hd?
2007-12-13T23:53:00.000Z	ompaul	awjrichards	in such a position I would try to use a live CD and check out if the video stuff is happy - if the disk is over 4 years old then I might start to suspect it
2007-12-13T23:53:00.000Z	awjrichards	ompaul	- will do thank sfor your help.  too bad im on a brand new laptop (<1mo. old)
2007-12-13T23:55:00.000Z	ompaul	awjrichards	do the live CD if it works then I think you need to consider that something in the upgrade went badly wrong, it will take you either a few mins to work out what happened, or it will take you hours and hours - you might consider backup of your personal data and then consider a reinstall - there are options in apt-get to get it to check out all the existing packages and make sure they were downloaded correctly and installed right
2007-12-13T23:55:00.000Z	awjrichards	ompaul	- thanks a lot for the advice
2007-12-13T23:55:00.000Z	ompaul	awjrichards	gtg pity I can't have more time here :-( later
