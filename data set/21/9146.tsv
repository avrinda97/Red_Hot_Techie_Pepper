2006-05-27T13:22:00.000Z	distanceisdeath		i have to partition my 35.7 gigs
2006-05-27T13:22:00.000Z	Terminus	distanceisdeath	i have a partition layout here with the same size. you wanna see it? :)
2006-05-27T13:23:00.000Z	Terminus	distanceisdeath	well, what i did was i made minimal space for the required mount points and the rest just goes to /home.
2006-05-27T13:24:00.000Z	Terminus	distanceisdeath	oh, just 10GB. is the entire hard disk taken up by windows?
2006-05-27T13:25:00.000Z	Terminus	distanceisdeath	ok, and you want ubuntu to take up 10GB too?
2006-05-27T13:29:00.000Z	Terminus	distanceisdeath	simplest thing i can think of is 128MB for /boot, 2x your ram for swap, and the rest for /
2006-05-27T13:29:00.000Z	Terminus	distanceisdeath	i can't guide you through which menu item to go to and what to enter coz i don't memorize those stuff.
2006-05-27T13:34:00.000Z	Terminus	distanceisdeath	according to other people, better defrag for ntfs partitions --> http://www.dirms.com/home/homepage.asp
2006-05-27T13:35:00.000Z	Terminus	distanceisdeath	that should help you when resizing.
2006-05-27T13:36:00.000Z	Terminus	distanceisdeath	compact your filesystem before truncating the partition. you need that if you have to resize.
2006-05-27T13:38:00.000Z	Terminus	distanceisdeath	not exactly. you have to understand for yourself how filesystems and partitions work.
2006-05-27T13:39:00.000Z	Terminus	distanceisdeath	well, partitionmagic should probably work. a defrag is always recommend though.
