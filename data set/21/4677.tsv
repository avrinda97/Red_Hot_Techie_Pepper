2008-03-04T12:18:00.000Z	b_ecca		after doin visudo  'visudo: /etc/sudoers: Permission denied'
2008-03-04T12:19:00.000Z	AndrewMc	b_ecca	can you run the "Users and Groups" settings app?
2008-03-04T12:20:00.000Z	b_ecca	AndrewMc	nope
2008-03-04T12:20:00.000Z	AndrewMc	b_ecca	did you enable your root account first?
2008-03-04T12:20:00.000Z	AndrewMc	b_ecca	if not, today is going to be your lucky day; you get to learn to use a rescue CD!
2008-03-04T12:20:00.000Z	b_ecca	AndrewMc	i dunno
2008-03-04T12:21:00.000Z	b_ecca	AndrewMc	i tried logging into root but it wont log in
2008-03-04T12:21:00.000Z	AndrewMc	b_ecca	try using a resuce CD
2008-03-04T12:22:00.000Z	b_ecca		is there another way? AndrewMc i think that'll be my last choice if nothing else works :)
2008-03-04T12:22:00.000Z	AndrewMc		if you can't log in as root, you need to boot with something that will let you be root.
2008-03-04T12:23:00.000Z	AndrewMc	b_ecca	are you comfortable editing /etc/group ?
2008-03-04T12:23:00.000Z	b_ecca		i can see it but i think it doesnt want me to save
2008-03-04T12:23:00.000Z	b_ecca		i can see /etc/group
2008-03-04T12:23:00.000Z	b_ecca		can i do chmod?
2008-03-04T12:24:00.000Z	AndrewMc	b_ecca	no, becuase you don't own /etc/group.  reboot from a CD
2008-03-04T12:24:00.000Z	b_ecca		so after rebotting i just edit /etc/group then add what?
2008-03-04T12:25:00.000Z	AndrewMc	b_ecca	add your username to the line that starts with adm
2008-03-04T12:25:00.000Z	AndrewMc	b_ecca	then save the file, the reboot from the hard drive.
