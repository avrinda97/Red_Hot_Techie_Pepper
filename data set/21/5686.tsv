2008-10-05T19:04:00.000Z	takamarou	sudobash	how do I check if it will spin up?
2008-10-05T19:09:00.000Z	takamarou	sudobash	yes the HD is spinning
2008-10-05T19:12:00.000Z	sudobash	takamarou	sudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sda1 /media/windows -o force 0 0
2008-10-05T19:16:00.000Z	sudobash	takamarou	did you try what I said?
2008-10-05T19:17:00.000Z	takamarou	sudobash	yeah.  I was actually using /dev/sdb1 and mounting to /media/data so I changed that..  it gave me some error though.  I think the syntax was wrong
