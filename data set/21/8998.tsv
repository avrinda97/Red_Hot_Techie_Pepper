2005-12-05T06:23:00.000Z	tyler		How does the Synaptic Package Manager work exactly?  Does it detect new packages that you may install?
2005-12-05T06:24:00.000Z	pbransford	tyler	its just an interface for the apt and dpgk suites
2005-12-05T06:24:00.000Z	tyler	pbransford	ok, thanks.
2005-12-05T06:25:00.000Z	pbransford	tyler	openoffice
2005-12-05T06:27:00.000Z	pbransford	tyler	run this as root:
2005-12-05T06:28:00.000Z	tyler	pbransford	do i need to log in as root? or can i sudo?
2005-12-05T06:28:00.000Z	pbransford	tyler	sudo -s
2005-12-05T06:28:00.000Z	tyler	pbransford	so sudo -s before that command, or individually
2005-12-05T06:28:00.000Z	tyler	pbransford	k gotcha
2005-12-05T06:29:00.000Z	pbransford	tyler	by default downloads dont have the executable permission set. Virus & user idiocy prevention
2005-12-05T06:29:00.000Z	tyler	pbransford	oh okay, that explains a lot.
2005-12-05T06:29:00.000Z	tyler	pbransford	could i just right click and alter permissions through GUI as well in the future?
2005-12-05T06:30:00.000Z	pbransford	tyler	yea... forgot about that
2005-12-05T06:30:00.000Z	tyler	pbransford	np, learning is good.
2005-12-05T06:31:00.000Z	tyler	pbransford	when i attempt to run it, after altering the permissions, i get: "Unable to find the system utility 'ld'; make sure you have installed the package 'binutils'..."
2005-12-05T06:31:00.000Z	pbransford	tyler	you'll need kernel headers installed as well
2005-12-05T06:31:00.000Z	tyler	pbransford	what would that be? Sorry.
2005-12-05T06:33:00.000Z	tyler	pbransford	I looked and didn't really see a good readme.  If i find it would it explain the kernel headers/binutils problem? Haha
2005-12-05T06:39:00.000Z	pbransford	tyler	the hardware its running on
2005-12-05T06:40:00.000Z	tyler	pbransford	I'm running 32bit Ubuntu..
2005-12-05T06:40:00.000Z	pbransford	tyler	and the availability of binaries may be different
