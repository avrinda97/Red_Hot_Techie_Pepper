2006-12-09T13:54:00.000Z	ashmo		Okay... Hypothetical situation: the user who is also the admin and main user of a system wishes to mount a harddisk for porn^H^H^H^Hprivate data. What would be an apropriate mount point under the hierarchy standard?
2006-12-09T13:55:00.000Z	lemonsCC	ashmo	you can set any mount point
2006-12-09T13:56:00.000Z	lemonsCC	ashmo	media and mnt are the normal places
2006-12-09T13:56:00.000Z	ashmo	lemonsCC	but that seems so upcluttering and random.
2006-12-09T13:56:00.000Z	lemonsCC	ashmo	howso?
2006-12-09T13:57:00.000Z	lemonsCC	ashmo	/media/private is better
2006-12-09T13:57:00.000Z	ashmo	lemonsCC	isn't /media for CDs, etc?
2006-12-09T13:58:00.000Z	lemonsCC	ashmo	you can throw a HD there too
2006-12-09T13:58:00.000Z	lemonsCC	ashmo	media gets an icon on the desktop and mnt doesnt is the difference
2006-12-09T13:58:00.000Z	ashmo	lemonsCC	ah, so mnt makes more sense if most users won't have access.
2006-12-09T13:59:00.000Z	lemonsCC	ashmo	well they will still have access...IF they know where to look
2006-12-09T13:59:00.000Z	lemonsCC	ashmo	have it mount in YOUR home folder
2006-12-09T14:00:00.000Z	lemonsCC	ashmo	you could mount it with nouser
2006-12-09T14:00:00.000Z	lemonsCC	ashmo	then only root can mount it
2006-12-09T14:00:00.000Z	lemonsCC	ashmo	assuming you have the only root access
2006-12-09T14:01:00.000Z	lemonsCC	ashmo	so you could a) mount it in your home folder b) -r c) nouser
2006-12-09T14:02:00.000Z	ashmo	lemonsCC	Hm... nouser sounds sensible. For some reason my NTFS drives are already mounted readable for root only, too.
2006-12-09T14:03:00.000Z	ashmo	lemonsCC	That's "nouser" in fstab instead of "defaults", right?
2006-12-09T14:03:00.000Z	lemonsCC	ashmo	i think nouser would require you to "sudo mount </dev/blah>"
2006-12-09T14:03:00.000Z	lemonsCC	ashmo	yes
2006-12-09T14:03:00.000Z	lemonsCC	ashmo	you can always tweak it
