2011-10-24T06:12:00.000Z	ForSpareParts		I'm just checking, can anybody actually see my messages right now? If no one can help me, that's cool, but I'd feel pretty stupid if for some reason I was actually talking to no one and waiting for a reply.
2011-10-24T06:14:00.000Z	ForSpareParts		Can anyone help me with my FTP server under 11.10? Stopped working, and I don't know why...
2011-10-24T06:16:00.000Z	ForSpareParts		hello?
2011-10-24T06:17:00.000Z	ForSpareParts		Hey, Jordan. I asked before but didn't hear anything. I honestly wasn't sure if anyone could even see my messages....
2011-10-24T06:17:00.000Z	ForSpareParts		Anyway:
2011-10-24T06:18:00.000Z	ForSpareParts		I had proftpd installed before I went 11.10
2011-10-24T06:18:00.000Z	ForSpareParts		along with GADMIN proftpd to manage it.
2011-10-24T06:18:00.000Z	ForSpareParts		After 11.10, gadmin would start, but it couldn't start the server. I don't recall the error message, but
2011-10-24T06:18:00.000Z	ForSpareParts		I've reinstalled both gadmin and proftpd several times, no dice so far.
2011-10-24T06:18:00.000Z	usr13	ForSpareParts	sudo apt-get install vsftp   or   sudo apt-get install proftpd
2011-10-24T06:19:00.000Z	usr13	ForSpareParts	What is gadmin?
2011-10-24T06:19:00.000Z	usr13	ForSpareParts	  ftp localhost   #See if it is running.
2011-10-24T06:20:00.000Z	usr13	ForSpareParts	Sorry, I've not had any experience with gadmin
2011-10-24T06:20:00.000Z	ForSpareParts	usr13	tried ftp localhost and got 421 service not available
2011-10-24T06:20:00.000Z	usr13	ForSpareParts	sudo apt-get install vsftp   or   sudo apt-get install proftpd
2011-10-24T06:21:00.000Z	ForSpareParts	usr13	I did proftpd already, so I guess I'll try vsftp. Thanks!
2011-10-24T06:21:00.000Z	usr13	ForSpareParts	If you already have proftpd just use it.
2011-10-24T06:22:00.000Z	usr13	ForSpareParts	sudo apt-get install proftpd
2011-10-24T06:22:00.000Z	ForSpareParts	usr13	I did that already.
2011-10-24T06:26:00.000Z	usr13	ForSpareParts	apt-get remove proftpd ; apt-get install vsftpd
2011-10-24T06:27:00.000Z	ForSpareParts	usr13	alright, I'll try that. Again, thanks for your help and your patience.
