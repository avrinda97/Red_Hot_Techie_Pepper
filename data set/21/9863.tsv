2005-06-29T12:25:00.000Z	ttyS0		hello, people. firstly sorry for bad english. i have  a question. of course i'm using ubuntu and has internet access via dialup (USR 56K Faxmodem (Sportster) ext.). i've installed gnome-ppd, configured it BUT, it can't initialize modem. i trie dto edit ~/.wvdial.conf but it rewrites it each time before initializing. so what to do?
2005-06-29T12:25:00.000Z	ttyS0		the problem is in ATZ string
2005-06-29T12:26:00.000Z	djm62	ttyS0	you know for sure the correct configuration?
2005-06-29T12:26:00.000Z	ttyS0	djm62	i think so
2005-06-29T12:27:00.000Z	ttyS0	djm62	it send ATZ string to modem and it replies "!z"
2005-06-29T12:27:00.000Z	djm62	ttyS0	manually, you can get wvdial to connect to the ISP (with or without fully networking)?
2005-06-29T12:27:00.000Z	ttyS0	djm62	yes
2005-06-29T12:29:00.000Z	djm62	ttyS0	try installing gnome-ppp. It's more customisable than the gnome networking dialogue
2005-06-29T12:30:00.000Z	ttyS0	djm62	lol. read higher. i've installed gnome-ppp but have problems with initialization
2005-06-29T12:31:00.000Z	djm62	ttyS0	oh, damn.  you could add a launcher to the gnome panel to run the wvdial command that you know is working, as a workaround
2005-06-29T12:32:00.000Z	djm62	ttyS0	it sounds like a flaw in the software: a polite email to the developers might be an idea too
2005-06-29T12:34:00.000Z	ttyS0	djm62	but i think i've asked question correctly :)
2005-06-29T12:34:00.000Z	djm62	ttyS0	yes, absolutely! not your fault at all
2005-06-29T12:35:00.000Z	djm62	ttyS0	actually...gnome-ppp setup dialogue allows you to make custom init strings
2005-06-29T12:36:00.000Z	ttyS0	djm62	yes, i know about this feature, BUT...it starts from Init2 and there isn't "Init" string where ATZ is located :)
2005-06-29T12:39:00.000Z	djm62	ttyS0	I /think/ that ATZ is resetting your modem, so it doesn't matter what init1 is
2005-06-29T12:40:00.000Z	ttyS0	djm62	my modem can't recognize that string. there'
2005-06-29T12:41:00.000Z	djm62	ttyS0	I think that you'd be best making a launcher on the panel for wvdial :-/
2005-06-29T12:41:00.000Z	ttyS0	djm62	thank you for help, i'll follow your advice
2005-06-30T13:02:00.000Z	djm62	ttyS0	have you tried right-clicking on the file and opening in rhythmbox?  the way rhythmbox was intended to be used, you "add to library" from the application, a directory at a time
2005-06-30T13:05:00.000Z	ttyS0	djm62	yup. but it doesn't play anything :\
