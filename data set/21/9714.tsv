2005-07-25T11:39:00.000Z	dgimusique		here is what happens when i try to open the synaptic : Child terminated with 1 status... it won't open
2005-07-25T11:40:00.000Z	reka	dgimusique	you sure you don't have a session open already?
2005-07-25T11:41:00.000Z	dgimusique	reka	where should that be?
2005-07-25T11:42:00.000Z	reka	dgimusique	you probably have an open synaptic window already
2005-07-25T11:42:00.000Z	dgimusique	reka	all i have opened is this X-chat and AIM talking to my girlfriend
2005-07-25T11:49:00.000Z	reka	dgimusique	ok, full error again please?
2005-07-25T11:51:00.000Z	reka	dgimusique	ok, and you entered *your* password?
2005-07-25T11:53:00.000Z	reka	dgimusique	ah, there you go
2005-07-25T11:53:00.000Z	reka	dgimusique	i think you need to add yourself to the sudoers file
2005-07-25T11:53:00.000Z	reka	dgimusique	read the wiki page i sent you
2005-07-25T11:56:00.000Z	dgimusique	reka	i can't even add a new user it gives me the same error... looks like i have an account problem in here :S
2005-07-25T11:57:00.000Z	reka	dgimusique	well, i'm pretty certain that's what you need to do....do it with a user who already has sudo privileges.
2005-07-25T11:59:00.000Z	reka	dgimusique	doesn't the wik tell you?
2005-07-25T12:02:00.000Z	dgimusique	reka	yup and everytime i try any of the commands in there i get the same thing : dgimusique is not in the sudoers file.
2005-07-25T12:03:00.000Z	reka	dgimusique	weird....if you're the only user, you should be able to sudo
2005-07-25T12:03:00.000Z	dgimusique	reka	i even tried logging out and loggin back in
2005-07-25T12:06:00.000Z	reka	dgimusique	ok, to double check, you did the 'adding users' step on the wiki page?
2005-07-25T12:06:00.000Z	dgimusique	reka	it tells me i'm not in the sudoers file even when i try that
2005-07-25T12:07:00.000Z	reka	dgimusique	logout, then iirc, you can log in as root using the username 'root' or 'rootuser' and the root password you set
2005-07-25T12:07:00.000Z	reka	dgimusique	then try adding yourself
2005-07-25T12:16:00.000Z	dgimusique	reka	i tried everything you told me... there is no way i can login into root... it tells me i'm not allowed to login as admin at the login screen
