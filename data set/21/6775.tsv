2007-02-01T16:24:00.000Z	EniGm0		hello
2007-02-01T16:25:00.000Z	EniGm0		does anyone know how i can resize my font in console because it exceeds my screen most of the time
2007-02-01T16:25:00.000Z	morrolan	EniGm0	- you mean proper CLI or terminal?
2007-02-01T16:26:00.000Z	morrolan	EniGm0	- edit /boot/grub/menu.lst and find the current kernel line
2007-02-01T16:27:00.000Z	morrolan	EniGm0	-you will have to reboot to test obviously
2007-02-01T16:28:00.000Z	morrolan	EniGm0	- I think so, but I don't know if it will interfere with the graphical boot or not - it might just replace the graphical bootup
2007-02-01T16:34:00.000Z	EniGm0	morrolan	vga=736 is considered an undefined mode number
2007-02-01T16:34:00.000Z	morrolan	EniGm0	- vga=791 I said
2007-02-01T16:38:00.000Z	EniGm0	morrolan	deleting the "quiet" in the kernel line from /boot/grub/menu.lst shows the services starting up underneat the splash screen and nothing else changes
2007-02-01T16:38:00.000Z	morrolan	EniGm0	- what type of monitor are you using?
2007-02-01T16:38:00.000Z	EniGm0	morrolan	and 791 works great thx!
2007-02-01T16:39:00.000Z	EniGm0	morrolan	A philips 150s lcd
2007-02-01T16:39:00.000Z	morrolan	EniGm0	- I'll send you mine in a pastebin
2007-02-01T16:40:00.000Z	EniGm0	morrolan	it's okay now
2007-02-01T16:40:00.000Z	EniGm0	morrolan	i just wanted to let u know that deleting that 'quiet' will show u the services starting up at boottime
2007-02-01T16:41:00.000Z	morrolan	EniGm0	- sorry, I misunderstood when you said nothing else changed!
2007-02-01T16:42:00.000Z	morrolan	EniGm0	- so that did what you wanted?
2007-02-01T16:42:00.000Z	EniGm0	morrolan	yes thanks, i can see more now when i do ps aux, still not everything, but more :)
2007-02-01T16:43:00.000Z	EniGm0	morrolan	or is it also possible to make the lines split?
2007-02-01T16:43:00.000Z	EniGm0	morrolan	when i do ps aux; some lines go out of the screen, so i cant see the end, and they don't split and go on on the next line. Is there a way to do that?
2007-02-01T16:44:00.000Z	morrolan	EniGm0	- I don't know I'm afraid - look here for more mode numbers:  http://jsdl.sourceforge.net/docs/howto_console.html
