2007-11-05T00:50:00.000Z	towlie	bulmer	i guess the default location. i installed it with the package manager
2007-11-05T00:50:00.000Z	towlie	bulmer	locate swat returns nothing
2007-11-05T00:51:00.000Z	bulmer	towlie	do an updatedb && locate swat  may take a lil while..
2007-11-05T00:51:00.000Z	towlie	bulmer	swat is in /usr/sbin
2007-11-05T00:51:00.000Z	bulmer	towlie	then in a terminal   /usr/sbin/swat
2007-11-05T00:52:00.000Z	towlie	bulmer	i did that and it just hangs. nothing happens
2007-11-05T00:52:00.000Z	bulmer	towlie	and nothing shows up on ps aux?
2007-11-05T00:52:00.000Z	towlie	bulmer	no
2007-11-05T00:52:00.000Z	bulmer	towlie	i dont know then, you may have to re-install it
2007-11-05T01:15:00.000Z	bulmer	towlie	maybe you have to set via smbpasswd
