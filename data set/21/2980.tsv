2009-08-25T22:10:00.000Z	mbeierl	Saik	I am having nvidia black screen bug :)
2009-08-25T22:11:00.000Z	Saik	mbeierl	you use the ubuntu repo?
2009-08-25T22:12:00.000Z	mbeierl	Saik	 The nvidia driver?  No - the restricted drivers thing kept hanging on me.  But I've used the latest stable, the latest beta, legacy, too many versions to mention - all to no avail
2009-08-25T22:12:00.000Z	Saik	mbeierl	whay GPU?
2009-08-25T22:12:00.000Z	mbeierl	Saik	I /think/ I might have come up with the workaround though...
2009-08-25T22:12:00.000Z	mbeierl	Saik	01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation G72M [Quadro NVS 110M/GeForce Go 7300] (rev a1)
2009-08-25T22:13:00.000Z	mbeierl	Saik	in compiz config, under workarounds there is the Force sync between X and GLX and that seems to help with windows that are not being updated
2009-08-25T22:13:00.000Z	mbeierl	Saik	still waiting on the black window bug...

2009-08-25T22:14:00.000Z	Saik	mbeierl	my bad, sorry
2009-08-25T22:14:00.000Z	mbeierl	Saik	I have not tried 36 yet.  Last 185 I tried was 185.18.41
2009-08-25T22:15:00.000Z	Saik	mbeierl	you install in root?
2009-08-25T22:16:00.000Z	mbeierl	Saik	as root, yes.  gdm stop, unload nvidia module, install from VT 1...
2009-08-25T22:16:00.000Z	Saik	mbeierl	do it from "safe mode"
2009-08-25T22:16:00.000Z	mbeierl	Saik	usually the nvidia installer wants all X servers stopped, so I do the install right from the vt
2009-08-25T22:19:00.000Z	Saik	mbeierl	well, try n recovery, if that don't work I don't know what to do.I have to run
