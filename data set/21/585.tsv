2011-09-12T14:02:00.000Z	haha_guyz		i also try open it using windows and it say the drive need format.
2011-09-12T14:03:00.000Z	haha_guyz		but the disk utility detect it..
2011-09-12T14:04:00.000Z	natalie	haha_guyz	do you know what file system you have on the drive?
2011-09-12T14:06:00.000Z	haha_guyz		fat32 i think..
2011-09-12T14:07:00.000Z	natalie		so when you connect the drive, it is not mounted automatically? when you say you can see it in disk util, what does it say?
2011-09-12T14:12:00.000Z	haha_guyz	natalie	yes,its not mount automaticaly and in disk utility i doesn't show my partition in thumbdrive at all..
2011-09-12T14:13:00.000Z	haha_guyz	natalie	 yes,its not mount automaticaly and in disk utility i doesn't show my partition in thumbdrive at all..
2011-09-12T14:15:00.000Z	haha_guyz	natalie	i also df command in terminal and it doesn't show my pendrive
2011-09-12T14:15:00.000Z	natalie	haha_guyz	what do you see in ls /media
2011-09-12T14:17:00.000Z	haha_guyz	natalie	nope nothing..
2011-09-12T14:18:00.000Z	natalie	haha_guyz	try sudo fdisk -l and see if it lists the drive.
2011-09-12T14:21:00.000Z	haha_guyz	natalie	nope..
2011-09-12T14:22:00.000Z	haha_guyz	natalie	does this mean my thumbdrive need to be format?
2011-09-12T14:22:00.000Z	natalie	haha_guyz	if it's not important information on it, i would just bite the bullet and do it
2011-09-12T14:23:00.000Z	natalie	haha_guyz	you could see if it even detects the drive properly with lsusb, but that wont tell you much
2011-09-12T14:24:00.000Z	natalie	haha_guyz	testing is detailed here also
2011-09-12T14:25:00.000Z	natalie	haha_guyz	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/TestingStorageMedia but if you dont see it listed as a device in fdisk you might not have much luck
2011-09-12T14:27:00.000Z	haha_guyz	natalie	thank you natalie...
2011-09-12T14:27:00.000Z	haha_guyz	natalie	i think i want to format it..
2011-09-12T14:28:00.000Z	haha_guyz	natalie	if it still can't.. ithink i need to change my thumbdrive...
