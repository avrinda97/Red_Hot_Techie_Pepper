2012-08-09T00:37:00.000Z	designbybeck		Has anyone put Ubuntu on a newer HP EliteBook laptop?
2012-08-09T00:38:00.000Z	designbybeck		a HP EliteBook 2760p
2012-08-09T00:38:00.000Z	RyanP	designbybeck	I'm running it on an EliteBook 8560w
2012-08-09T00:39:00.000Z	designbybeck	RyanP	 We had Kubuntu running on her old one, but they got her a new one... 4GB RAM i7core 64bit SSD
2012-08-09T00:39:00.000Z	designbybeck		pretty decked out, I'm about to try and put Ubuntu on there
2012-08-09T00:40:00.000Z	RyanP	designbybeck	I'm running regular Ubuntu 12.04 on it. Works fine for me. Not sure about the fingerprint sensor.
2012-08-09T00:41:00.000Z	designbybeck		yes yes I can tell by your name I offended you! :P i7c
2012-08-09T00:42:00.000Z	designbybeck		it is booting ubuntu right now
2012-08-09T00:42:00.000Z	designbybeck		like I said we had her older Elitebook working
2012-08-09T00:42:00.000Z	designbybeck		and we were running kubuntu
2012-08-09T00:42:00.000Z	designbybeck	RyanP	 I dont' think they setup her fingerprint sensor anyway on windows side
2012-08-09T00:42:00.000Z	designbybeck		IT here that is
2012-08-09T00:48:00.000Z	designbybeck		Well I booted into it
2012-08-09T00:48:00.000Z	designbybeck		the touch screen isn't working out of the box
2012-08-09T00:49:00.000Z	designbybeck		I am just doing the Try Ubuntu Live boot at the moment
2012-08-09T00:49:00.000Z	designbybeck		but seems snappy enough
2012-08-09T00:49:00.000Z	designbybeck		guess I can install
2012-08-09T00:59:00.000Z	designbybeck		Uh oh!... Right after the Webcam/picture selection on the install... everything went blank
2012-08-09T01:03:00.000Z	designbybeck		this isn't good
2012-08-09T01:22:00.000Z	designbybeck	RyanP	are you on 32bit or 64 with your HP EliteBook?
2012-08-09T01:23:00.000Z	RyanP	designbybeck	64
