2009-09-29T02:09:00.000Z	terrylee42		is this the beginner room?
2009-09-29T02:09:00.000Z	terrylee42		okies, erusl.
2009-09-29T02:10:00.000Z	terrylee42		Yahoo techie chat reps tell me of a special password Evolution needs to access their mail servers.  Said ya'll would have it.
2009-09-29T02:11:00.000Z	maco	terrylee42	they lied
2009-09-29T02:11:00.000Z	maco	terrylee42	itd be your own password as usual, IF youve paid yahoo for IMAP/POP access. if you have a free account, you cnt use a desktp client with yahoo
2009-09-29T02:11:00.000Z	terrylee42		lied?  then I have no access to my email through Evolution cause there is no password?
2009-09-29T02:12:00.000Z	terrylee42	maco	 I've been using Outlook for my email with no problem, then I started reading about Ubuntu and am giving this a try.
2009-09-29T02:12:00.000Z	maco	terrylee42	you use your normal email password
2009-09-29T02:13:00.000Z	terrylee42		I did, maco, but from Evolution, it isn't recognized.
2009-09-29T02:13:00.000Z	maco	terrylee42	unless yahoo have invented something other than imap or pop3...
2009-09-29T02:13:00.000Z	terrylee42		it's a pop3, maco.
2009-09-29T02:13:00.000Z	maco	terrylee42	did you configure all the proper server info?
2009-09-29T02:13:00.000Z	maco	terrylee42	and the right port?
2009-09-29T02:13:00.000Z	terrylee42		yes, maco.
2009-09-29T02:14:00.000Z	terrylee42		the msn mail is operating just fine, just not my main email: yahoo.
2009-09-29T02:14:00.000Z	maco	terrylee42	umm ive never heard of having TWO passwords on one pop account. and there's definitely not a second password field for pop in evolution
2009-09-29T02:15:00.000Z	maco	terrylee42	and also, this channel is just random people, so i dont know how they can authoritatively say that someone who knows this magical secret password will be here
2009-09-29T02:15:00.000Z	terrylee42		then I get my msn mail on Ubuntu and my yahoo mail on windows.  hmmmm.
2009-09-29T02:15:00.000Z	maco	terrylee42	i think they were just trying to get you off the phone
2009-09-29T02:15:00.000Z	terrylee42		then I have to call back and back and back?
2009-09-29T02:16:00.000Z	maco	terrylee42	have you tried just googling to see how people use them together?
