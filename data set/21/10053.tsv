2005-05-31T16:36:00.000Z	skel_home		so anyone on ubuntu and firefox updates?
2005-05-31T16:36:00.000Z	nalioth	skel_home	its securely updated, just the version wasnt changed
2005-05-31T16:36:00.000Z	skel_home	nalioth	what kind of crap answer is that?
2005-05-31T16:37:00.000Z	nalioth	skel_home	sorry you didnt like it. the devs have patched ff up to 1.0.4, but havent changed the ver in ubuntu
2005-05-31T16:37:00.000Z	skel_home	nalioth	how are people supposed to know if its patched?
2005-05-31T16:38:00.000Z	nalioth	skel_home	do you have a ff update waiting when you apt-get?
2005-05-31T16:38:00.000Z	skel_home	nalioth	I've tried to apt-get mozilla-firefox several times always telling me its the current version.
2005-05-31T16:38:00.000Z	skel_home	nalioth	is that what you mean?
2005-05-31T16:39:00.000Z	nalioth	skel_home	so you are updated
2005-05-31T16:40:00.000Z	skel_home	nalioth	...
2005-05-31T16:40:00.000Z	skel_home	nalioth	I've been doing that since 1.0.3 and its *NEVER* downloaded a new one.. so how the hell could I be patched to 1.0.4
2005-05-31T16:40:00.000Z	nalioth	skel_home	go to update.mozilla.org and get "user agent switcher" and change your ver to 1.0.4 if you like (or you can edit the internal config for the same effect0
2005-05-31T16:41:00.000Z	nalioth	skel_home	to my knowledge, no one here has reported d/l anything past 1.0.2
2005-05-31T16:41:00.000Z	nalioth	skel_home	i'm just relaying to you what has been being said in here for a few days now
2005-05-31T16:41:00.000Z	skel_home	nalioth	so then there is no update for it yet.. why go around telling people its patched when you're really clueless?
2005-05-31T16:42:00.000Z	nalioth	skel_home	i'm not clueless. one of the ops explained it t'other day in here
2005-05-31T16:42:00.000Z	skel_home	nalioth	I appreciate the effort.. but if I wanted a parrot I'd go buy one.. I need good info.
2005-05-31T16:43:00.000Z	nalioth	skel_home	if you are knowledgable of what a patch is, why don't you patch it yourself?
2005-05-31T16:45:00.000Z	skel_home	nalioth	thats not the point.. the point is that (according to you)  ubuntu is patching applications to another level without reflecting that the application has been patched to that level.. its not 1.0.2 if its patched.. its 1.0.4  so the version should reflect as such
2005-05-31T16:47:00.000Z	nalioth	skel_home	sorry, i can't squawk anymore on this. ask one of the ops why ubuntu devs name things the way they do
2005-05-31T16:47:00.000Z	skel_home	nalioth	ok well thank you for your time either way.. even if I'm an asshole I do appreciate it =P
