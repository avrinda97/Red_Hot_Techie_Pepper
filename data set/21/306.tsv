2012-03-16T10:17:00.000Z	hydrox24	orionsonofneptun	are you sure that it's a dvd drive?
2012-03-16T10:18:00.000Z	hydrox24	orionsonofneptun	yeh, ok well... where do you expect it to show up exactly?
2012-03-16T10:20:00.000Z	hydrox24	orionsonofneptun	open up your file browser and look the the top left
2012-03-16T10:20:00.000Z	hydrox24	orionsonofneptun	it should be there
2012-03-16T10:22:00.000Z	hydrox24	orionsonofneptun	not sure, but can you please check?
2012-03-16T10:24:00.000Z	hydrox24	orionsonofneptun	can you tell me if there is output of "ls /dev/ | grep dvd"
2012-03-16T10:25:00.000Z	orionsonofneptun	hydrox24	 how do i do that
2012-03-16T10:25:00.000Z	hydrox24	orionsonofneptun	can you open a terminal?
2012-03-16T10:25:00.000Z	hydrox24	orionsonofneptun	do so,  then copy the text I sent you and click on the terminal, the key combo to paste is ctrl-shift V
2012-03-16T10:26:00.000Z	hydrox24	orionsonofneptun	It will tell me if you have a dvd device
2012-03-16T10:26:00.000Z	hydrox24	orionsonofneptun	just tell me if there is any output.
2012-03-16T10:27:00.000Z	hydrox24	orionsonofneptun	OK, that means that the device is definetely there.
2012-03-16T10:29:00.000Z	hydrox24	orionsonofneptun	you're gonna need to get your story straight, before you said it "didn't even spin" and now it *does* spin but then it stops?
2012-03-16T10:33:00.000Z	hydrox24	orionsonofneptun	try the cdrecord program to test writing to the cd
2012-03-16T10:34:00.000Z	hydrox24	orionsonofneptun	It's tricky to test if it can be read because there is no data on it.
2012-03-16T10:34:00.000Z	hydrox24	orionsonofneptun	can you lay your hand on a DVD *with* some data already on it?
2012-03-16T11:03:00.000Z	hydrox24	orionsonofneptun	are you able to put in a DVD that has something already on it?
