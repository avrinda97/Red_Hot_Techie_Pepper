2007-09-27T16:41:00.000Z	mrnotsoclever	peabody	i rebooted but no change at all
2007-09-27T16:41:00.000Z	peabody	mrnotsoclever	Okay, try the other installers
2007-09-27T16:41:00.000Z	peabody	mrnotsoclever	there were several files in the archive correct?
2007-09-27T16:45:00.000Z	mrnotsoclever	peabody	he tells me he is unable to call several files things being like this and tells "Put the main program(s3utility) into the bin directory: /usr/local/bin
2007-09-27T16:45:00.000Z	mrnotsoclever	peabody	but there is no s3utility anywhere ...
2007-09-27T16:46:00.000Z	mrnotsoclever	peabody	u think i need to d/l another programm like s3utility?
2007-09-27T16:46:00.000Z	peabody	mrnotsoclever	were there any instructions on the website you got the files from?
2007-09-27T16:46:00.000Z	mrnotsoclever	peabody	well, i think i'll go there again
2007-09-27T16:54:00.000Z	mrnotsoclever	peabody	shame on me, they do have a guide on what to do. but it is terribly complicated and confusing.. they give me lists of package dependencies and tell me to compilate the kernel and blah.. but it's all not very clear
2007-09-27T16:55:00.000Z	peabody	mrnotsoclever	lucky you.  bummer your card isn't easy to support.  The most frustrating thing about linux is knowing that it's possible to get your hardware working but it's going to be a lot of work :)
2007-09-27T16:55:00.000Z	mrnotsoclever	peabody	the most frustrating thing is that this "tutorial" seems to include a lot of steps that are part of a standard ubuntu installation
2007-09-27T16:58:00.000Z	peabody	mrnotsoclever	It's the community documentation.  You can get to it off of ubuntu.com by following the documentation link there.
2007-09-27T05:01:00.000Z	mrnotsoclever	peabody	i found the wiki, but they dont have any howto for my card (unless im too dumb to search properly)
2007-09-27T05:02:00.000Z	peabody	mrnotsoclever	did you try the text rather than the title search?
2007-09-27T05:09:00.000Z	mrnotsoclever	peabody	text search did the trick.. but they only find me laptop tests which indicate my problems and a dubious link to a fix, which was for 64bit however and didnt work
2007-09-27T05:09:00.000Z	peabody	mrnotsoclever	Joy
2007-09-27T05:10:00.000Z	mrnotsoclever	peabody	im bursting with happiness :)
2007-09-27T05:10:00.000Z	peabody	mrnotsoclever	Unfortunately you best bet is probably the ubuntu forums to see if you can get someone to guide you through the installation of your card.
2007-09-27T05:12:00.000Z	mrnotsoclever	peabody	i guess so.. can you tell me if i miss anything on this list though? Ubuntu Linux 7.04 dependency packages (deb):     autoconf (>2.53)    automake(>1.6)    autotools-dev    build-essential    bash    cpp-4.1    gcc-4.1-base    gcc-4.1    linux-source-2.6.20    libdrm-dev    libgl1-mesa-dev    libncurse5    libnucrse5-dev
2007-09-27T05:12:00.000Z	peabody	mrnotsoclever	missing?  for what?  I don't know what it is you need
2007-09-27T05:19:00.000Z	mrnotsoclever	peabody	okay, thank you really, really much for your help.. i think im gonna switch back to windows for a few days now and try to collect all the information i need to set up grapics properly :)
