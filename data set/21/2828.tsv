2012-11-28T06:31:00.000Z	jrib	Zal	it explains why it's prompting
2012-11-28T06:31:00.000Z	Zal	jrib	yes, I understand what the prompt is asking. When I tell dpkg to ignore that package it does so, but then prompts about removing deprecated packages.
2012-11-28T06:32:00.000Z	jrib	Zal	pastebin
2012-11-28T06:32:00.000Z	Zal		There doesn't seem to be a way to get it to NOT prompt.
2012-11-28T06:32:00.000Z	jrib	Zal	tell it what you want it to do...
2012-11-28T06:32:00.000Z	Zal		how?
2012-11-28T06:32:00.000Z	Zal		This script worked fine for years, until today.
2012-11-28T06:33:00.000Z	Zal		so something outside changed
2012-11-28T06:33:00.000Z	jrib	Zal	there's probably a dpkg option. Scripts like these seem dangerous
2012-11-28T06:33:00.000Z	Zal		yeah, I tried the dpkg option, it didn't work
2012-11-28T06:33:00.000Z	jrib	Zal	"the dpkg option" being?
2012-11-28T06:34:00.000Z	Zal		well, as I stated above, I tried setting DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive for starters, nothing.
2012-11-28T06:34:00.000Z	jrib	Zal	that wouldn't do anything in this situation
2012-11-28T06:34:00.000Z	Zal		Also tried was DPkg::Options="--force-confold", but that was someone else, so I'm not sure what it's supposed to do.
2012-11-28T06:35:00.000Z	Zal		The real question is though -- why did this suddently STOP working? What is the difference?
2012-11-28T06:35:00.000Z	jrib	Zal	so read its description, so you understand what you are donig.
2012-11-28T06:35:00.000Z	jrib	Zal	as the message you pasted says, there was a modification made to the configuration file
2012-11-28T06:35:00.000Z	Zal		but this has always been so.
2012-11-28T06:35:00.000Z	Zal		and the script never prompted before today.
2012-11-28T06:36:00.000Z	jrib	Zal	it should have, to my understanding.  But I can only guess at what the script is
2012-11-28T06:36:00.000Z	Zal	jrib	well thanks, I'll check on the modified file.
