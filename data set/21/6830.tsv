2008-06-17T23:15:00.000Z	chazco		Hi... is there a problem with the repos? This is the 10th or so attempt at installing i've made today and yet again a package has screwed up (seahorse) this time...
2008-06-17T23:16:00.000Z	chazco		So... once more, apt is broken
2008-06-17T23:16:00.000Z	dabaR	chazco	you can post the errors you get to pastebin.ubuntu.com, and I will look at them,
2008-06-17T23:17:00.000Z	chazco	dabaR	- "dpkg: error processing seahorse (--configure):
2008-06-17T23:18:00.000Z	dabaR	chazco	something is broken. Try "sudo dpkg --configure -a"
2008-06-17T23:18:00.000Z	chazco	dabaR	- Its been like this on multiple machines with fresh installs over the past few days
2008-06-17T23:19:00.000Z	dabaR	chazco	post the contents of your /etc/apt/sources.list file to the pastebin. Please do not paste in the channel.
2008-06-17T23:23:00.000Z	dabaR	chazco	the seahorse app is somehow in limbo. Did you run that "sudo dpkg --configure -a"?
2008-06-17T23:23:00.000Z	chazco	dabaR	- Each time ive tried a fresh install or update something like that has happened.... i have no idea whats wrong. Its either the repos have gone dodgy or something is corrupting stuff en-route to here...
2008-06-17T23:25:00.000Z	dabaR	chazco	Did you run that "sudo dpkg --configure -a"?
2008-06-17T23:25:00.000Z	chazco	dabaR	- About 30000000 times in the last few days... its some other issue
2008-06-17T23:25:00.000Z	dabaR	chazco	and you get that error again, right?
2008-06-17T23:26:00.000Z	chazco	dabaR	- I did earlier... this is yet another fresh install
2008-06-17T23:26:00.000Z	dabaR	chazco	why not try now?
2008-06-17T23:26:00.000Z	chazco	dabaR	- It didnt work
2008-06-17T23:26:00.000Z	dabaR	chazco	same error, right?
2008-06-17T23:26:00.000Z	dabaR	chazco	and when you run sudo apt-get purge seahorse?
2008-06-17T23:27:00.000Z	dabaR	chazco	and when you run sudo apt-get remove --purge seahorse?
2008-06-17T23:27:00.000Z	dabaR	chazco	sorry to hear that. Good luck.
2008-06-17T23:31:00.000Z	dabaR	chazco	ya, it looks like there are CDs that will come out every once in a while with cumulative updates, but updates will always happen. What happened to your install is that some package did not get installed properly and is blocking up apt. I have fixed this on my computer before, and would be glad to help you, if you will follow some instructions and use the pastebin...
2008-06-17T23:31:00.000Z	chazco	dabaR	- It happened to about 20 attempts at installs, on multiple machines... with _different_ packages.
