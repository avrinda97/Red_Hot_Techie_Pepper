2006-12-10T15:38:00.000Z	Jeffm515_		reboots.
2006-12-10T15:38:00.000Z	Jeffm515_		lol
2006-12-10T15:38:00.000Z	Jeffm515_		sorry.. I was waiting for it to reboot..
2006-12-10T15:39:00.000Z	Jeffm515_		yea, no go..
2006-12-10T15:40:00.000Z	Jeffm515_		it comes up with loading linux Kernel, and reboots.
2006-12-10T15:40:00.000Z	Jeffm515_		keep in mind, it's a compaq evo tower..
2006-12-10T15:42:00.000Z	Jeffm515_		ok
2006-12-10T15:43:00.000Z	Jeffm515_		HuibertG1|| same
2006-12-10T15:44:00.000Z	HuibertG1ll	Jeffm515_	not good.
2006-12-10T15:44:00.000Z	HuibertG1ll	Jeffm515_	are you sure the boot cd is without errors and scratches?
2006-12-10T15:45:00.000Z	HuibertG1ll	Jeffm515_	could you give me the exact compaq name, maybe google can help
2006-12-10T15:51:00.000Z	HuibertG1ll	Jeffm515_	I cant find a compaq 26020 on google, what kind of machine is it? (cpu ram hardisk)
2006-12-10T15:57:00.000Z	HuibertG1ll	Jeffm515_	hmmm, it should _just_ boot and work, no idea what is going on.
2006-12-10T15:58:00.000Z	HuibertG1ll	Jeffm515_	and because you cannot say _where_ the reboot happens, it is hard to say what is causing it ....
2006-12-10T15:59:00.000Z	HuibertG1ll	Jeffm515_	the only thing left to try is to dissconnect anything not needed to install, (sound card, ..) and turn off things in the biios (onboard lan, usb , ...)
2006-12-10T15:59:00.000Z	HuibertG1ll	Jeffm515_	have you tried the memtest?
2006-12-10T16:00:00.000Z	HuibertG1ll	Jeffm515_	onbaord things, can be disabled in the bios
2006-12-10T16:00:00.000Z	HuibertG1ll	Jeffm515_	(sweep statement) if memetest is not working, your hardwre is broken
2006-12-10T16:02:00.000Z	HuibertG1ll	Jeffm515_	then it is up to you to rember what it was :-) , sorry I think I cannot help you any further
