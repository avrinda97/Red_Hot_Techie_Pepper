2008-07-23T23:42:00.000Z	trooper	takamarou	if you give some more detail what the problem is
2008-07-23T23:43:00.000Z	takamarou	trooper	I had to manually edit my xorg.conf to get my computer to recognize the drivers, and now when I go to Nvidia X Server Settings Dialog it says I am not using the Nvidia X Drivers.  When I run the suggested command I get sent back to low graphics mode.  I need to get into the settings dialog, or else I cannot enable OpenGL
2008-07-23T23:43:00.000Z	trooper	takamarou	did you try nvidia-xconfig?
2008-07-23T23:44:00.000Z	takamarou	trooper	that is the command that sends me back to low graphics mode
2008-07-23T23:44:00.000Z	takamarou	trooper	unfortunately it doesn't.  It makes my driver nvidia, but it needs to be nv.
2008-07-23T23:45:00.000Z	trooper	takamarou	when you set driver to nv it breaks down to low graphics?
2008-07-23T23:45:00.000Z	takamarou	trooper	no, when I set it to nv it works.  nvidia-xconfig sets my driver as nvidia, and then I get sent down to low graphics mode.
2008-07-23T23:46:00.000Z	trooper	takamarou	i believe nv is the open source driver for nvidia cards which may explain why nvidia-settings doesnt like it
2008-07-23T23:47:00.000Z	takamarou	trooper	I had it working with nv as the driver setting before.. but after a reboot everything stopped working.
2008-07-23T23:48:00.000Z	trooper	takamarou	does /var/log/Xorg.0.log give any hints?
2008-07-23T23:48:00.000Z	takamarou	trooper	no idea.. I can't interpret that.  want me to paste it for you?
2008-07-23T23:48:00.000Z	trooper	takamarou	in query please, the last 10 lines or sth should be sufficient
2008-07-23T23:49:00.000Z	trooper	takamarou	double click my nick in the list
2008-07-23T23:49:00.000Z	takamarou	trooper	oh, ok
2008-07-23T23:50:00.000Z	trooper	takamarou	that are the first lines arent they?
2008-07-23T23:50:00.000Z	takamarou	trooper	nope.  the last
2008-07-23T23:51:00.000Z	trooper	takamarou	okay, that doenst help indeed
2008-07-23T23:52:00.000Z	takamarou	trooper	would seeing the whole thing help?  or not?
2008-07-23T23:52:00.000Z	trooper	takamarou	give it a try
