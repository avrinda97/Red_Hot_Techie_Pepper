2011-03-24T10:29:00.000Z	Karen_m		i like to play on full tilt poker once in a while and it comes up all wrong, the fonts work initially but after the game crashes (rare, but happens), then the fonts will be messed to the point you can't read
2011-03-24T10:31:00.000Z	Linuxpwns	Karen_m	Full Tilt Poker is listed as a supported game under Play on Linux ver 3.8.12
2011-03-24T10:31:00.000Z	Karen_m	Linuxpwns	what does that mean?  I don't have to run it under wine?
2011-03-24T10:32:00.000Z	Linuxpwns		POL uses wine
2011-03-24T10:32:00.000Z	Linuxpwns		but it will resolve all your dependecies fo ryou...like if it requires directx, .net framework, c++ redist package, etc
2011-03-24T10:34:00.000Z	Karen_m	Linuxpwns	what is POL?

2011-03-24T10:37:00.000Z	Linuxpwns		ActionParnsnip: I cannot verify Full Tilt Poker exists as supported game under 3.7, thats why I recommended 3.8 as it is the version i have
2011-03-24T10:41:00.000Z	Linuxpwns		Karen_b:  Full Tilt Poker is working perfectly fine for me under POL installation. Did you have font issues with the game itself?
2011-03-24T10:44:00.000Z	Karen_m	Linuxpwns	thanks for that Play On Linux thing.  it's installed, now I am just waiting on the application list update download to finish... :)
2011-03-24T10:47:00.000Z	Linuxpwns	Karen_m	No problem. I just installed the Toy Story 3 video game for PC. It works perfectly fine under wine! You'll never catch me evil Doctor Porkchop. hahA

2011-03-24T10:49:00.000Z	Karen_m		So far so good with the fonts with Full Tilt!
