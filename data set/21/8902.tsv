2005-12-19T17:03:00.000Z	jdeange2		yay /ignore!
2005-12-19T17:03:00.000Z	jdeange2		does that actually *call* the ops?
2005-12-19T17:03:00.000Z	jdeange2		ah
2005-12-19T17:04:00.000Z	jdeange2		c'mon boys, pick up the phone
2005-12-19T17:04:00.000Z	jdeange2		kickBAN
2005-12-19T17:04:00.000Z	jdeange2		or she'll probably just autorejoin and start again
2005-12-19T17:05:00.000Z	jdeange2		unless it really is a bot
2005-12-19T17:05:00.000Z	jdeange2		yes, it is
2005-12-19T17:05:00.000Z	jdeange2		why is that
2005-12-19T17:05:00.000Z	jdeange2		why isn't /ignore aliased to something useful by default
2005-12-19T17:06:00.000Z	Alex	jdeange2	Define useful
2005-12-19T17:06:00.000Z	jdeange2	Alex	intuitive default behavior
2005-12-19T17:07:00.000Z	Alex	jdeange2	/ignore foo ignores them completely?
2005-12-19T17:07:00.000Z	jdeange2	Alex	/ignore foo ignores foo!*@*.domain.tld
2005-12-19T17:07:00.000Z	Alex	jdeange2	xchat?
2005-12-19T17:08:00.000Z	jdeange2	Alex	Yup
2005-12-19T17:08:00.000Z	Alex	jdeange2	Cough.. irssi does it alright ;P. You might want to poke the dev-team, mind. They'd probably be quiet happy for feedback?
2005-12-19T17:09:00.000Z	jdeange2		I normally use irssi, but xterm doesn't seem to be handling it well
2005-12-19T17:09:00.000Z	jdeange2		screen keeps blanking
2005-12-19T17:09:00.000Z	jdeange2		turning blue, ironically
2005-12-19T17:09:00.000Z	Alex	jdeange2	Tried eterm?
