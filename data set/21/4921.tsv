2008-09-13T14:50:00.000Z	MTecknology	ActionParsnip	I woulda guessed there'd be one file i could edit

2010-08-02T03:04:00.000Z	MTecknology	ActionParsnip	thanks :)
2011-01-19T10:25:00.000Z	MTecknology	ActionParsnip	'most' ubuntu members on irc have an ubuntu/member hostmask so you can see by /whois <nick>
2011-01-19T10:29:00.000Z	MTecknology	ActionParsnip	I remember way back when I was in that list :P
2011-01-19T10:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MTecknology	i'd be #1 but martinP contributes a lot to a space program (if i remember right) and he gets karma from that. He even admits it feels like cheating :D
2011-01-19T10:32:00.000Z	MTecknology	ActionParsnip	Yup, he even had a bug open about that once.
2011-01-19T10:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MTecknology	HA, dude that's hilarious
2011-01-19T10:34:00.000Z	MTecknology	ActionParsnip	not only that- but they felt it was accurate and karma calculations were adjusted otherwise he'd be many miles ahead
2011-01-19T10:34:00.000Z	MTecknology	ActionParsnip	there was something else he was doing that gave waaay too much to your karma
2011-01-19T10:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MTecknology	little bit, as long as folks enjoy the OS then I'm happy. Karma imho just helps with membership applications
2011-01-19T10:36:00.000Z	MTecknology	ActionParsnip	does it really even help with that; I think they're 'supposed to' look at what contributed to that karma more than the number (i think they do a pretty good job of that)  I used to think it was fun when I had a whole lot; but now I contribute in other areas that don't add to karma much and it's less exciting to watch it chance
