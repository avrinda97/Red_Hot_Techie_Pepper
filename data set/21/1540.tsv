2012-05-09T03:15:00.000Z	DX099		DE is gnome-shell 3.4, session crashed without warning, can't figure out what happened. Running 12.04 precise with nvidia 295.40.
2012-05-09T03:16:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	DX099	ok, you mentioned not being able to change themes, do you get an error or something?
2012-05-09T03:17:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	DX099	your last 2 comments contradict each other... (confused)
2012-05-09T03:17:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	DX099	did you recently perform an upgrade
2012-05-09T03:18:00.000Z	DX099	DarwinSurvivor	I upgraded to precise 1 or 2 weeks ago
2012-05-09T03:19:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	DX099	and the issue started right after the upgrade?
2012-05-09T03:20:00.000Z	DX099	DarwinSurvivor	no. The session crashed just a few minutes ago.
2012-05-09T03:22:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	DX099	are you still there?
2012-05-09T03:22:00.000Z	DX099	DarwinSurvivor	yes, I answered
2012-05-09T03:42:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	DX099	no, I was waiting for you to come back
2012-05-09T03:43:00.000Z	DX099	DarwinSurvivor	I was there, I answered you twice...
2012-05-09T03:46:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	DX099	the issue is most likely stale gnome settings. try deleting the gnome settings folders (~/.gnome* ~/.conf/gnome*) and then logging out/in again
2012-05-09T03:47:00.000Z	DX099	DarwinSurvivor	Ok, I'll try that
2012-05-09T03:57:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	DX099	can you please post a link to where you acquired the themes? it could be that they are too old.
2012-05-09T03:59:00.000Z	DX099	DarwinSurvivor	mostly from devianart. I especially checked their 3.4 compatibility. Besides, gnome was already at 3.4 before the crash/issue and they were working, as well as Icon themes which besides shouldn't be affected i think
2012-05-09T04:00:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	DX099	it's very difficult for us to debug a non-working theme if we don't know what theme isn't working!
2012-05-09T04:07:00.000Z	DX099	DarwinSurvivor	All of them, apart from Ambiance. Window themes are changing (Metacity if I'm right). But as for GTK themes and Icon themes, I can't change anything. I'm stuck to Ambiance and regular gnome icon theme. Even when trying from "Appearance" menu, Adwaita (default gnome shell) will just change its window, but the inner decoration will still remain Ambiance.
2012-05-09T04:09:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	DX099	sorry, but I can't think of anything else to do to resolve your issue.
2012-05-09T04:09:00.000Z	DX099	DarwinSurvivor	:/. Thanks anyway for trying
2012-05-09T04:44:00.000Z	DX099	DarwinSurvivor	.config/desktop-couch/desktop-couchdb.ini was faulty
2012-05-09T04:45:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	DX099	ah. good to know!
