2009-12-23T16:01:00.000Z	Younder	c_nick	edit the grub, using e at boot
2009-12-23T16:01:00.000Z	Younder	c_nick	add a 'text' option
2009-12-23T16:01:00.000Z	Younder	c_nick	the you will boot into text mode
2009-12-23T16:02:00.000Z	Younder	c_nick	then at the command line use a addgrp comman (man addgrp first)
2011-09-14T14:25:00.000Z	Younder	c_nick	you need the bash start file
2011-09-14T16:59:00.000Z	Younder	c_nick	 that would be init.d
2011-09-14T16:59:00.000Z	Younder	c_nick	 which is a serious problem
2011-09-14T16:59:00.000Z	Younder	c_nick	what is in /boot/
2011-09-14T17:00:00.000Z	c_nick	Younder	lot of stuff
2011-09-14T17:01:00.000Z	Younder	c_nick	take it to a paste page
2011-09-14T17:18:00.000Z	c_nick	Younder	basically this started when i ran android ndk-gdb too which is just like gdb .. so first instance started which bugged out then second time it said that error message
