2009-02-22T18:48:00.000Z	KevDog	JoeLow	you are doing a manual configuration for your wireless card.  What do you want to do!
2009-02-22T18:49:00.000Z	KevDog	JoeLow	Are your simply at a terminal right now?  I mean you don't need a gui or really any package if you configure your wireless card manually
2009-02-22T18:50:00.000Z	JoeLow	KevDog	i want to be able to configure my wireless without having to startx
2009-02-22T18:50:00.000Z	KevDog	JoeLow	Does running iwlist scan show your network?
2009-02-22T18:51:00.000Z	KevDog	JoeLow	Do you see your netork?

2009-02-22T18:52:00.000Z	JoeLow	KevDog	no
2009-02-22T18:52:00.000Z	KevDog	JoeLow	Do you want dhcp or a static IP?
2009-02-22T18:52:00.000Z	KevDog	JoeLow	Ok: sudo iwconfig essid "Belkin54G"
2009-02-22T18:53:00.000Z	KevDog	JoeLow	Then: sudo dhclient eth1
2009-02-22T18:53:00.000Z	JoeLow	KevDog	yes i know, thats what im doing, but it doesnt seem to be joining that network, i thought it was a NEtworkManager problm?
2009-02-22T18:54:00.000Z	KevDog	JoeLow	What does lshw -C network show about the wireless chipset and driver?
2009-02-22T18:56:00.000Z	KevDog	JoeLow	I dont think NWM isthe problem.  What error are you getting after the dhclient command?
2009-02-22T18:57:00.000Z	JoeLow	KevDog	nothing, no error, after i do "iwconfig eth1..." i get no error, but it has not joined that netowrk
2009-02-22T18:57:00.000Z	KevDog	JoeLow	You do the iwconfig statement followed by dhclient
