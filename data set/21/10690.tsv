2004-12-20T11:50:00.000Z	oscarh		anyone who get segment fault with zinf?
2004-12-20T11:50:00.000Z	socomm	oscarh	Yes.
2004-12-20T11:51:00.000Z	oscarh	socomm	checked bugzilla.ubuntulinux.com but found nothing, checked debian to and found just as much.
2004-12-20T11:52:00.000Z	socomm	oscarh	Yeah I'm not too hot on zinf, I was just curious on how it would feel. Unfortunately it segfaulted, and I uninstalled.
2004-12-20T11:52:00.000Z	oscarh	socomm	loll, worked on wart, but i'm using hoary now
2004-12-20T11:53:00.000Z	socomm	oscarh	That might be it, I'm using hoary as well.
2004-12-20T11:53:00.000Z	oscarh	socomm	still, it schouldn't seg fault
2004-12-20T11:54:00.000Z	socomm	oscarh	You can try to backtrace it and submit a bug report to ubuntus mailing list.
2004-12-20T11:54:00.000Z	socomm	oscarh	I'd do it my self but I'm happy with xmms/bmp/mplayer/etc ....
2004-12-20T11:55:00.000Z	oscarh	socomm	argh, so much work
2004-12-20T11:56:00.000Z	socomm	oscarh	TNSTAAFL
2004-12-20T11:56:00.000Z	oscarh	socomm	it aint that important, and bogreports from multivere or whatever is supposed to go to debain
2004-12-20T11:57:00.000Z	socomm	oscarh	Okay, just stick with some other player for the time being I suppose.
2004-12-20T11:57:00.000Z	oscarh	socomm	i guess
2004-12-20T12:11:00.000Z	oscarh	socomm	 download ISO on dialup?
2004-12-20T12:13:00.000Z	oscarh	socomm	but did it work with warty?
2004-12-20T12:13:00.000Z	socomm	oscarh	It would take how long? One~two Days? Plus he would have the ISO if ever he needed to install or reinstall.
2004-12-20T12:13:00.000Z	socomm	oscarh	I know the bios worked with FreeBSD, but apparently not with GNU/Linux so I flashed it. I'm not saying this will work in your case, just a thought though.
2004-12-20T12:14:00.000Z	oscarh	socomm	just wanted to know..
2004-12-20T12:15:00.000Z	socomm	oscarh	Deutsch.
2004-12-20T12:15:00.000Z	oscarh	socomm	i know, a guard came and asked for id, i paniked .)
