2008-09-26T00:14:00.000Z	v3ctor	[Solars]	do you want to run ubuntu while running windows or do you just want to access the ubuntu partition from windows?
2008-09-26T00:14:00.000Z	[Solars]	v3ctor	i want dual boot cabpility, and be able to run ubuntu from the hdd while in windows
2008-09-26T00:15:00.000Z	v3ctor	[Solars]	then you want something like virtualbox
2008-09-26T00:15:00.000Z	[Solars]	v3ctor	virtualbox install a virtual OS
2008-09-26T00:16:00.000Z	v3ctor	[Solars]	yes
2008-09-26T00:17:00.000Z	v3ctor	[Solars]	virtual is the only way to achieve what you want
2008-09-26T00:18:00.000Z	[Solars]	v3ctor	starting to realize that, but want to make sure before i go through the hassels of redoing my raid and reformating
2008-09-26T00:18:00.000Z	v3ctor	[Solars]	you can just slap ntfs on the other drive and put you virtual disk on that
2008-09-26T00:19:00.000Z	[Solars]	v3ctor	that is an option i suppose
2008-09-26T00:19:00.000Z	v3ctor	[Solars]	that is what i do
2008-09-26T00:20:00.000Z	v3ctor	[Solars]	i run ubuntu and windows in virtualbox
2008-09-26T00:20:00.000Z	[Solars]	v3ctor	erm suppose i could that
2008-09-26T00:20:00.000Z	v3ctor	[Solars]	also on seperate drives
2008-09-26T00:21:00.000Z	[Solars]	v3ctor	but then i lose the ability to dual boot
2008-09-26T00:21:00.000Z	v3ctor	[Solars]	virtualbox isn't that scary and there are people in #vbox that can help
2008-09-26T00:22:00.000Z	[Solars]	v3ctor	not scared of it, just trying to figure out how to accomplish what i want
2008-09-26T00:22:00.000Z	v3ctor	[Solars]	first you must figure out exactly what it is you want
2008-09-26T00:24:00.000Z	[Solars]	v3ctor	basically what i want is the option to duelboot and be able to run ubunto from within windows using a dedicated hdd
2008-09-26T00:32:00.000Z	v3ctor	[Solars]	there is a way to boot an existing linux install from virtualbox, i have not tried it and have no idea what impact would have
2008-09-26T00:37:00.000Z	[Solars]	v3ctor	how do you make that happen?
2008-09-26T00:37:00.000Z	v3ctor	[Solars]	llike i said, i have not done it. maybe the guys in #vbox can help
