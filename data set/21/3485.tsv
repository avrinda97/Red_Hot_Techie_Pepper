2008-12-19T10:22:00.000Z	TriBeCa99		basically i'm not able to get online at all. i've been assuming it's because ubuntu hasn't recognized the onboard LAN
2008-12-19T10:23:00.000Z	TriBeCa99		but i'm wondering if it's just not configured properly

2008-12-19T10:25:00.000Z	fryguy	TriBeCa99	i don't care about what your router shows, i care about the behavior on the ubuntu machine
2008-12-19T10:26:00.000Z	TriBeCa99	fryguy	google.com is an unknown host, pinging the router shows it unreachable
