2006-03-05T14:52:00.000Z	btdown		no evo sux.
2006-03-05T14:53:00.000Z	btdown		thunderbird is good...and hasa spam filter that actually works.
2006-03-05T14:54:00.000Z	btdown		no you hafta install it...
2006-03-05T14:54:00.000Z	gnomefreak	btdown	evos spamfilter works fine (spamassasine) but we are not here to debate what works when it works its all personal preff.
2006-03-05T14:55:00.000Z	gnomefreak	btdown	it worked fine for me in breezy
2006-03-05T14:56:00.000Z	gnomefreak	btdown	i set it up just like i set up spam assasin in sylpheed
2006-03-05T14:57:00.000Z	btdown	gnomefreak	lol, well that doesnt help much, but I'll at least go back an revisit it.
2006-03-06T06:49:00.000Z	gnomefreak	btdown	i use it but i only use 1 script for it
2006-03-06T06:50:00.000Z	btdown	gnomefreak	the irssi docs arent the greatest..perhaps if I saw some examples of how it was set up, it would click. ;(
2006-03-06T06:50:00.000Z	gnomefreak	btdown	irssi.org has some really good scripts but some i wouldnt use in here as they will get you banned
2006-03-06T06:50:00.000Z	gnomefreak	btdown	make a dir using mkdir ~/.irssi/scripts/ than add the script to there
2006-03-06T06:51:00.000Z	btdown	gnomefreak	Im not interested in scripts beyond getting to do simple things like autoconnect and identify... like the docs say its supposed to...
2006-03-06T06:51:00.000Z	gnomefreak	btdown	that is a script
2006-03-06T06:51:00.000Z	gnomefreak	btdown	scripts are the only way to modify irssi
2006-03-06T06:52:00.000Z	btdown	gnomefreak	well it has /commands to add servers and specify if you autologin but it doesnt work for me..I'll keep pluggin away. thanks for the info, though.
2006-03-06T06:53:00.000Z	gnomefreak	btdown	try /help on the server page for list of commands
2006-03-06T06:53:00.000Z	btdown	gnomefreak	thanks. I'm going through the docs now. Wish me luck.
2006-03-09T09:57:00.000Z	gnomefreak	btdown	it doesnt affect anything
2006-09-29T06:19:00.000Z	gnomefreak	btdown	it is
2006-09-29T06:31:00.000Z	gnomefreak	btdown	yes but people dont understand that all the time
2006-09-29T06:31:00.000Z	btdown	gnomefreak	gotchu man... ;()
