2012-02-27T23:32:00.000Z	dtcrshr		after iv apt-get update / upgrade, i have this message - 0 packages..... 4 not updated
2012-02-27T23:32:00.000Z	dtcrshr		this are linux-generic, linux-headers-generic, linux-image-generic and software center
2012-02-27T23:32:00.000Z	dtcrshr		is there a way to upgrade and force this 4 to be updated?
2012-02-27T23:33:00.000Z	CFHowlett	dtcrshr	  one does not simply force packages...
2012-03-01T01:13:00.000Z	CFHowlett	dtcrshr	  I've been forced to learn a whole lot about broadcom wifi installation.  Can I help?
2012-03-01T01:14:00.000Z	dtcrshr	CFHowlett	oh please! im struggling for some time now
2012-03-01T01:15:00.000Z	CFHowlett	dtcrshr	  and the wifi version?
2012-03-01T01:15:00.000Z	CFHowlett	dtcrshr	  wait 1
2012-03-01T01:16:00.000Z	CFHowlett	dtcrshr	  ubuntu version
2012-03-01T01:17:00.000Z	dtcrshr	CFHowlett	11.10, downloaded yesterday morning
2012-03-01T01:17:00.000Z	CFHowlett	dtcrshr	  "by the numbers" i.e. step by step using this tutorial:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx
2012-03-01T01:18:00.000Z	CFHowlett	dtcrshr	  by my reading you should use the STA Internet Access method.
2012-03-01T01:20:00.000Z	CFHowlett	dtcrshr	  let's NOT change the proven method just yet...
2012-03-01T01:37:00.000Z	dtcrshr	CFHowlett	well, as the guide you sent me, iv followed the guides for the STA drivers. first iv went online via cable connection, and via synaptic iv reinstalled the bcmwl-kernel-source as told. after i was able to enable the sta driver via the aditional ones, it gets active ok, rebooted, still active, but i have no wireless
2012-03-01T01:39:00.000Z	CFHowlett	dtcrshr	  see the modprobe section - had the same thing happen to me.
2012-03-01T01:39:00.000Z	CFHowlett	dtcrshr	  specifically step 3 sudo modprobe -r b43 ssb sl && sudo modprobe wl
2012-03-01T01:41:00.000Z	CFHowlett	dtcrshr	  btw, last time I fixed this, I performed the STA no internet access method - worked out of the box.  Go figure
2012-03-01T01:43:00.000Z	dtcrshr	CFHowlett	yeah... bizzarre. ill give it a shot also
2012-03-02T02:11:00.000Z	dtcrshr	CFHowlett	hey man, just tryed the STA no internet access but still no wireless on the d530
2012-03-02T02:12:00.000Z	CFHowlett	dtcrshr	  as I recall your chip had 2 methods we could have tried.  If STA doesn't work , try b43.  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx
2012-03-02T02:13:00.000Z	CFHowlett	dtcrshr	  also, I seem to recall that you had actually blacklisted the driver.  Blacklist = no wifi...
