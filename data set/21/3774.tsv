2009-04-01T12:57:00.000Z	akm1		hi.. im running windows using virtualbox in ububntu in fullscreen mode...but while logging sending ctrl-alt-del doesn't do anything to it...
2009-04-01T12:58:00.000Z	akm1		any idea whats the issue...
2009-04-01T12:58:00.000Z	H_M-Ubuntu	akm1	What is your host key? (Default is Right Control button)
2009-04-01T13:00:00.000Z	akm1	H_M-Ubuntu	 I get  fullscreen with no panels...how to get it back the panel
2009-04-01T13:00:00.000Z	H_M-Ubuntu	akm1	You're on your Windows guest I assume?
2009-04-01T13:01:00.000Z	akm1	H_M-Ubuntu	im running virtual machine from ubuntu...
2009-04-01T13:01:00.000Z	H_M-Ubuntu	akm1	Yes, Ubuntu is your host (The thing running virtual box), and Windows is your guest (The thing running INSIDE virtual box).
2009-04-01T13:02:00.000Z	akm1	H_M-Ubuntu	yeah..
2009-04-01T13:02:00.000Z	H_M-Ubuntu	akm1	Hit right ctrl + F, that should close fullscreen.. err exit fullscreen, rather.
2009-04-01T13:03:00.000Z	H_M-Ubuntu	akm1	Assuming you didn't change any of the default binds, that will work
2009-04-01T13:03:00.000Z	H_M-Ubuntu	akm1	Also, to fix your Ctrl + Alt + Delete problem, try using the LEFT Control button, and right Alt + Del.
2009-04-01T13:03:00.000Z	akm1	H_M-Ubuntu	thanks a lot...its working
2009-04-01T13:04:00.000Z	H_M-Ubuntu	akm1	No problem :) Further, have you installed guest additions on Windows?
2009-04-01T13:05:00.000Z	akm1	H_M-Ubuntu	no.. i havnt installed...
2009-04-01T13:07:00.000Z	H_M-Ubuntu	akm1	I recommend it, it is very useful. Care to install it now? All it basically does is add integration between the host OS and the guest OS. Such as mouse integration (The mouse and keyboard automatically are selected), Seamless mode (Ubuntu GNOME and Windows DWM are paralelled together), and other features.
2009-04-01T13:10:00.000Z	akm1	H_M-Ubuntu	how to install it ?
2009-04-01T13:10:00.000Z	H_M-Ubuntu	akm1	One sec i'll write out step by step instructions
2009-04-01T13:10:00.000Z	akm1	H_M-Ubuntu	ty
2009-04-01T13:12:00.000Z	H_M-Ubuntu	akm1	In the window holding the VM, click Devices > Install Guest Additions, It will mount a CD in Windows. If you don't have autorun on, the dialog won't pop up by default, so go to Start > (My) Computer > (Whatever CD drive) and open up the 32bit installer.
2009-04-01T13:13:00.000Z	H_M-Ubuntu	akm1	Then go through the on screen instructions, and reboot when done. They should be installed and you will see the results immediately.
2009-04-01T13:18:00.000Z	akm1	H_M-Ubuntu	thanks ..will try that...i dont have window cd right nw...
