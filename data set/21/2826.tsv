2010-02-07T22:49:00.000Z	unr3a1		hey all
2010-02-07T22:50:00.000Z	unr3a1		does anyone know what could cause ubuntu 9.10 to freeze after the computer has booted to the desktop?
2010-02-07T22:51:00.000Z	reto`	unr3a1	seems like some people have that issue... keeps coming up... I bet there are already some bug reports
2010-02-07T23:12:00.000Z	unr3a1	reto`	alright, thanks.
2010-02-07T23:13:00.000Z	reto`	unr3a1	found something then?
2010-02-07T23:24:00.000Z	unr3a1	reto`	not yet.  I went on break at work. stepped outside for a smoke... lol.  looking for potential bugs now
2010-02-07T23:38:00.000Z	unr3a1	reto`	There are bugs open in launchpad for freezing 9.10
2010-02-07T23:38:00.000Z	unr3a1	reto`	looks like a wide variety of things causing it
2010-02-07T23:38:00.000Z	reto`	unr3a1	that's the problem... hard to track
2010-02-07T23:38:00.000Z	reto`	unr3a1	try to find something that looks like "your" freeze
2010-02-07T23:39:00.000Z	unr3a1	reto`	well, it could be related to this proprietary nvidia driver bug
2010-02-07T23:40:00.000Z	unr3a1	reto`	the weird thing about my freezing, is that it freezes at the white ubuntu logo on startup, unless, I boot from the live CD first, then reboot.
2010-02-07T23:41:00.000Z	reto`	unr3a1	oh... it doesn't get to X even?
2010-02-07T23:42:00.000Z	unr3a1	reto`	ya, I dont get to X server.  thats MY freezing issue.  I have a friend who freezes once he is in X
2010-02-07T23:42:00.000Z	unr3a1	reto`	sorry for the confusion, I should have specified that
2010-02-07T23:42:00.000Z	reto`	unr3a1	remove usplash and quiet(?) on the grub line
2010-02-07T23:43:00.000Z	unr3a1	reto`	alright, I will write that down and try it to see if there are any errors.  I am at work at the moment, so I cant do it now, I am more or less looking for information.  lol
2010-02-07T23:51:00.000Z	unr3a1	reto`	Manii, the other thing is that when I do get booted into Linux, I am not able to right click on internet items ad do a "save as".  firefox just will NOT load the save as window to select a location
2010-02-07T23:55:00.000Z	unr3a1	reto`	Manii, 9.04 was working fine on my desktop, so I will most likely just format and go back to that.  thanks for all the info and input.  it really helped.
2010-02-07T23:57:00.000Z	reto`	unr3a1	ok, just try and see without usplash and you should see where it freezes
2010-02-07T23:59:00.000Z	unr3a1	reto`	yea, I will definitely do that first.  thanks again
