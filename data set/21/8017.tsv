2009-03-07T02:54:00.000Z	geotsai		i'm using ubuntu8.10 x64, and i used to be able to connect online through the wireless connection, but suddenly now, i cant.  can someone help me?
2009-03-07T02:54:00.000Z	turtle_	geotsai	lspci
2009-03-07T02:56:00.000Z	geotsai	turtle_	the wireless network is detected, but when i attempt to connect, it just stays with two green dots forever.  i can connect online using the same laptop when booting into windows tho.
2009-03-07T02:57:00.000Z	turtle_		tons of 64 bit CPUs come with 32 bit OS? I dont get it
2009-03-07T02:57:00.000Z	turtle_	geotsai	uninstall and reinstall the driver
2009-03-07T02:57:00.000Z	geotsai	turtle_	how would i do this? im just using the default driver that ubuntu installed
2009-03-07T02:58:00.000Z	turtle_	geotsai	in synaptic package manager
2009-03-07T02:58:00.000Z	turtle_		its in the added programs somewhere i think
2009-03-07T02:59:00.000Z	geotsai	turtle_	 thanks, ill take a look
2009-03-07T02:59:00.000Z	turtle_		make sure its not a silly error like your networking is turned off or something, geotsai
2009-03-07T03:00:00.000Z	geotsai	turtle_	 it attempts to connect, but is stuck at something like 'determining ip address' or something like that
2009-03-07T03:02:00.000Z	turtle_	geotsai	thats strange
2009-03-07T03:03:00.000Z	turtle_	geotsai	reset the router
2009-03-07T03:03:00.000Z	geotsai	turtle_	i was actually just wondering if there was a way to reinstall everything that has to do with networking and start from scratch. is there a way?
2009-03-07T03:03:00.000Z	geotsai	turtle_	i've done everything including trying different wireless connections etc.  same result
2009-03-07T03:03:00.000Z	turtle_		hmm
2009-03-07T03:04:00.000Z	turtle_		unplug the router and the base computer and turn it back  on, geotsai
2009-03-07T03:04:00.000Z	geotsai	turtle_	furthermore, it works perfectly in windows, so its isolated in ubuntu.  it doesnt appear to be driver based because it discoveres the network, but cant connect
2009-03-07T03:05:00.000Z	turtle_	geotsai	 you've got me stumped, sorry
2009-03-07T03:05:00.000Z	geotsai	turtle_	thansk for your help anyway
2009-03-07T03:05:00.000Z	turtle_	geotsai	welcome
