2005-10-10T12:14:00.000Z	dmlinux		hey chavo
2005-10-10T12:15:00.000Z	tga	dmlinux	/dev/input/mice
2005-10-10T12:16:00.000Z	dmlinux	tga	but Option "Device" is /dev/mous
2005-10-10T12:16:00.000Z	tga	dmlinux	well if you don't have one it's not gonna work, is it
2005-10-10T12:16:00.000Z	tga	dmlinux	/dev/input/mice represents all mice connected to the system, in case you have more than one
2005-10-10T12:17:00.000Z	dmlinux	tga	so is leaving option "device" /dev/mouse ok?
2005-10-10T12:17:00.000Z	tga	dmlinux	do you have a /dev/mouse?
2005-10-10T12:18:00.000Z	dmlinux	tga	not in /dev foulder
2005-10-10T12:18:00.000Z	tga	dmlinux	then why would you use it as a "device" if it doesn't exist? use /dev/input/mice
2005-10-28T10:30:00.000Z	dmlinux	tga	because i do :p
2005-10-28T10:30:00.000Z	tga	dmlinux	man sudoers and read about making sudo allow passwordless access to selected apps
2005-10-28T10:31:00.000Z	tga	dmlinux	then you can just run 'sudo firestarter'
2005-10-28T10:31:00.000Z	dmlinux	tga	i did that, but it came up with an error each time i loged in said i have insufficient preivelages
2005-10-28T10:31:00.000Z	tga	dmlinux	then you're not running it as root
2005-10-28T10:31:00.000Z	dmlinux	tga	oy,
2005-10-28T10:33:00.000Z	dmlinux	tga	dm ALL= NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/firestarter
2005-10-28T10:33:00.000Z	tga	dmlinux	and what do you get when you try "sudo firestarter" as dm?
2005-10-28T10:35:00.000Z	dmlinux	tga	looks like it works, but the same thing happened last time
2005-10-28T10:36:00.000Z	dmlinux	tga	gonna shut down and try it
2005-10-28T10:40:00.000Z	dmlinux	tga	 it worked, i think ididnt have root privelages.
2005-10-28T10:42:00.000Z	dmlinux	tga	never mind , the GUI isnt up
