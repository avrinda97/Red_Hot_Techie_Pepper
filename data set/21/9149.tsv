2006-11-18T11:33:00.000Z	ashika		And rorry if some applications say they are designed for KDE will they still run on GNOME?
2006-11-18T11:34:00.000Z	LjL	ashika	yes, they'll just install the bunch of KDE libraries
2006-11-18T11:35:00.000Z	LjL	ashika	you don't have to worry - KDE dependencies will just be installed automatically when you install the packages
2006-11-18T11:37:00.000Z	LjL	ashika	sudo not su
2006-11-18T11:38:00.000Z	LjL	ashika	no, but it's got sudo rights
2006-11-18T11:38:00.000Z	LjL	ashika	and when using sudo you effectively are root
2006-11-18T11:38:00.000Z	LjL	ashika	no, you need to do it every time you want to run something as root
2006-11-18T11:39:00.000Z	LjL	ashika	yes, "sudo -i"
2006-11-18T11:39:00.000Z	LjL	ashika	keeps you root until you type "exit"
2006-11-18T11:40:00.000Z	LjL	ashika	yes
2006-11-18T12:17:00.000Z	LjL	ashika	it will. you need to be root
2006-11-19T06:44:00.000Z	LjL	ashika	it's not a random password. it's a locked account.
