2012-11-29T08:40:00.000Z	RJ45-Q		Remote Desktop has SOOO much LAG!, I don't understand as my whole wired network is Gigabit, and System Monitor barely registers a 10% load!, why is Remote Desktop being so laggy, and how can I make is flow like a streaming video?
2012-11-29T08:41:00.000Z	Gnea	RJ45-Q	using Unity?
2012-11-29T08:42:00.000Z	Gnea	RJ45-Q	do you have the desktop effects turned on at all?
2012-11-29T08:43:00.000Z	RJ45-Q	Gnea	there still should be a solution to 10.04!, I mean, 10.04 is not SOO old!
2012-11-29T08:43:00.000Z	RJ45-Q	Gnea	barely any
2012-11-29T08:44:00.000Z	Gnea	RJ45-Q	weird... does that happen for any remote session or just the one host?
2012-11-29T08:44:00.000Z	RJ45-Q	Gnea	I tried once with a computer (that is now stored in a shed) and same crap.
2012-11-29T08:44:00.000Z	Gnea	RJ45-Q	also, what software are you using to perform remote connections?
2012-11-29T08:45:00.000Z	RJ45-Q	Gnea	the default installed one, Vinagre
2012-11-29T08:47:00.000Z	Gnea	RJ45-Q	rdesktop might work
2012-11-29T08:48:00.000Z	Gnea	RJ45-Q	it is GUI
2012-11-29T08:48:00.000Z	Gnea	RJ45-Q	freerdp-x11 might be something to try as well
2012-11-29T08:49:00.000Z	RJ45-Q	Gnea	it says "a later version is already installed! wtf!?!
2012-11-29T08:50:00.000Z	Gnea	RJ45-Q	just open a terminal and type: rdesktop
2012-11-29T08:50:00.000Z	Gnea	RJ45-Q	sorry, I thought rdesktop was GUI... I was wrong
2012-11-29T08:50:00.000Z	RJ45-Q	Gnea	I did, and it just blurted out a loada random what appears to be some sorta MAN page.
2012-11-29T08:52:00.000Z	Gnea	RJ45-Q	I'm gonna go with "yeah"
2012-11-29T08:52:00.000Z	RJ45-Q	Gnea	there is only a version for 11.10 and above :(
2012-11-29T08:52:00.000Z	Gnea	RJ45-Q	oh. perhapas there's a PPA
2012-11-29T08:56:00.000Z	Gnea	RJ45-Q	yup, there is one: https://launchpad.net/~global2000/+archive/freerdp-stable
2012-11-29T08:56:00.000Z	Gnea	RJ45-Q	once you add that, then you can install freerdp via apt
