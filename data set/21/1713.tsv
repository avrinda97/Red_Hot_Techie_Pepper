2012-10-09T08:52:00.000Z	syntaxx	LedHed	does it include the encryption?
2012-10-09T08:52:00.000Z	LedHed		no clue
2012-10-09T08:53:00.000Z	syntaxx	LedHed	i am thinkin to change the encryption part on the laptop
2012-10-09T08:53:00.000Z	LedHed		I created a custom theme for a company a few years ago as part of an LTSP deployment
2012-10-09T08:53:00.000Z	syntaxx	LedHed	because the encryption part of the ubuntu 12.04 is just a plain text

2012-10-09T08:57:00.000Z	syntaxx	LedHed	thanks for it. I already changed the boot splash screen on the plain ubuntu install. But trying the encrypted one I dont seem to find any help from google or maybe i dont know what it is called
2012-10-09T08:57:00.000Z	LedHed	syntaxx	what do you mean the "encrypted one"
2012-10-09T08:58:00.000Z	syntaxx	LedHed	when you install ubuntu and you use full encryption it will ask you a passphrase when it boots up. that what i am looking for
2012-10-09T08:58:00.000Z	LedHed		oh
2012-10-09T08:58:00.000Z	LedHed		no clue
2012-10-09T08:58:00.000Z	syntaxx	LedHed	i want to change that to something eyecandy
2012-10-09T08:59:00.000Z	LedHed		I see. Ya I wouldn't even know where to start
2012-10-09T09:00:00.000Z	syntaxx	LedHed	I saw a post on ubuntuforums but i dont think someone answered correctly http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=11907953&postcount=1

2012-10-09T09:01:00.000Z	LedHed		this bug probably references what you're looking for
2012-10-09T09:02:00.000Z	syntaxx	LedHed	probably that one but its 2010 bug somehow its fixed i think
2012-10-09T09:03:00.000Z	LedHed	syntaxx	the bug is probably fixed, but the there might be referenced to the theme. which might lead you to what you;re looking for.  (breadcrumbs)
