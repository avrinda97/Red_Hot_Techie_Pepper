2010-01-07T13:03:00.000Z	plustax2	Jordan_U	well can you tell me how to install metacity themes sir?
2010-01-07T13:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	plustax2	You aren't guarenteed help, if people know the answer to your question they will give it. Repeating it more often than one every 5 minutes or so will just annoy people
2010-01-07T13:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	plustax2	Sure, just drag the theme into System > Preferences > Appearance
2010-01-07T13:04:00.000Z	plustax2	Jordan_U	whats the theme file? Usually I just DL a tar ball. Just drag and drop it in there?
