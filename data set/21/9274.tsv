2005-12-10T07:23:00.000Z	saivert		hello
2005-12-10T07:24:00.000Z	saivert		RUnning Ubuntu Breezy badger (5.10) her.
2005-12-10T07:24:00.000Z	saivert		Just installed Firefox 1.5 (final), Thunderbird 1.5RC1 but got problems with nvidia-glx package. It sais nvidia as driver in xorg.conf
2005-12-10T07:25:00.000Z	saivert		What do you do when nvidia-glx driver (sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx nvidia-settings) does not work with GeForce Go 6600 chip?
2005-12-10T07:26:00.000Z	saivert		i did run sudo nvidia-settings enable
2005-12-10T07:26:00.000Z	saivert		Is there another channel where people help each other out or is this the right place?
2005-12-10T07:27:00.000Z	mustard5	saivert	your in the right place
2005-12-10T07:28:00.000Z	mustard5	saivert	have you installed the linux-restricted-modules for your kernel?
2005-12-10T07:43:00.000Z	mustard5	saivert	not necessarily
2005-12-10T07:46:00.000Z	mustard5	saivert	well sudo nvidia-glx-config enable is the actual command
2005-12-10T07:48:00.000Z	mustard5	saivert	you could try sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg  and attempt to reconfigure your xorg.cof
2005-12-10T07:48:00.000Z	mustard5	saivert	atm I am a bit mystified as to what it might be
2005-12-10T07:49:00.000Z	mustard5	saivert	what kernel you running?
2005-12-10T07:50:00.000Z	mustard5	saivert	uname -r
2005-12-10T07:51:00.000Z	mustard5	saivert	yes
2005-12-10T07:52:00.000Z	mustard5	saivert	sounds like you either need to run sudo apt-get update or enabled extra repositories
2005-12-10T07:52:00.000Z	mustard5	saivert	alternatively the package name is spelt wrong :)
2005-12-10T07:53:00.000Z	mustard5	saivert	search via synaptice :)
2005-12-10T07:54:00.000Z	mustard5	saivert	hmmm ok
2005-12-10T08:02:00.000Z	mustard5	saivert	can you pastebin your xorg.conf?
2005-12-10T08:04:00.000Z	mustard5	saivert	k..looking it over now...I'll compare to mine..I'm on nvidia too
