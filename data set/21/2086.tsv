2010-01-24T21:16:00.000Z	Kettlen		I'm trying to build a home NAS - can Ubuntu server go into suspend mode, or only Ubuntu desktop?
2010-01-24T21:17:00.000Z	ikonia	Kettlen	you can suspend ubuntu server, however why not use the desktop, it makes a great server OS
2010-01-24T21:18:00.000Z	Kettlen	ikonia	I suppose. I don't know a lot about Ubuntu, trying to figure out how to do it all! I'll be using a 4gb USB as OS-drive and 2x1TB drives in software RAID, serving files on the network, making backups and downloading torrents
2010-01-24T21:18:00.000Z	ikonia	Kettlen	the desktop OS will be fine, I assure you, plus it will be easier for you to learn while you set it up
2010-01-24T21:19:00.000Z	ikonia	Kettlen	putting your OS on a USB disk may not be the best move, try to use an internal bus drive
2010-01-24T21:19:00.000Z	Kettlen	ikonia	thanks for the tip! why not a USB drive, by the way?
2010-01-24T21:19:00.000Z	ikonia	Kettlen	slower interface
2010-01-24T21:19:00.000Z	ikonia	Kettlen	so your core OS would be on the slowest interface
2010-01-24T21:20:00.000Z	Kettlen	ikonia	well, I'll be using 2 S-ATA drives for the backup and file sharing, which is the essential part. Would that be affected by the USB performance (if the OS is on USB drive)?
2010-01-24T21:20:00.000Z	ikonia	Kettlen	yes
2010-01-24T21:21:00.000Z	ikonia	Kettlen	there are many VERY quiet drives on the market, you don't need solid state
2010-01-24T21:22:00.000Z	Kettlen	ikonia	actually I realize now that the MB I bought only has 2 S-ATA. Would it be stupid to put the OS on my mirrored 2x1TB disks?
2010-01-24T21:22:00.000Z	ikonia	Kettlen	that would be fine, and very resillient, good idea
2010-01-24T21:23:00.000Z	Kettlen	ikonia	In that case though, would I need to have hardware RAID, or could it be done via Ubuntu somehow? I don't think my motherboard has RAID built in
2010-01-24T21:23:00.000Z	ikonia	Kettlen	software raid is very very good
2010-01-24T21:24:00.000Z	Kettlen	ikonia	so I can install it on one of the drives first, and then have Ubuntu copy that disk to the other?
2010-01-24T21:24:00.000Z	ikonia	Kettlen	linux (ubuntu) comes with software raid, if you use the alternative install CD you can install to software raid (mirrored)
2010-01-24T21:24:00.000Z	ikonia	Kettlen	it works very very well
2010-01-24T21:25:00.000Z	Kettlen	ikonia	OK I see. If I put the OS on this mirrored set of drives - would they constantly have to be spinning? Or at least, spin up as soon as the OS needs to read to/from a file?
2010-01-24T21:26:00.000Z	ikonia	Kettlen	correct (I forgot you wanted to hibernate)
2010-01-24T22:06:00.000Z	Kettlen	ikonia	are you still around?
