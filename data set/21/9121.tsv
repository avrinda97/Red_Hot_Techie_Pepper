2006-03-10T16:57:00.000Z	SirKillalot		is there a chance to change the whole system language? I mean my kde/gnome is english, but programs like apt are still german, because I installed ubuntu in german
2006-03-10T16:57:00.000Z	SirKillalot		is there a method to change the whole system language?
2006-03-10T16:59:00.000Z	SirKillalot		I want them to be english
2006-03-10T16:59:00.000Z	soundray	SirKillalot	try to set LANGUAGE="en_GB:en" in /etc/environment
2006-03-10T16:59:00.000Z	SirKillalot	soundray	I'll have a try
2006-03-10T17:00:00.000Z	soundray	SirKillalot	or en_US
2006-03-11T17:00:00.000Z	SirKillalot	soundray	and "LANG"?
2006-03-11T17:00:00.000Z	SirKillalot	soundray	thats probably the charset, right?
2006-03-11T17:01:00.000Z	soundray	SirKillalot	I've set that to en_IE@euro because it's English and still has the Euro char ;)
2006-03-11T17:01:00.000Z	SirKillalot	soundray	do you have ?
2006-03-11T17:01:00.000Z	soundray	SirKillalot	with my GB keyboard, only through combinations.
2006-03-11T17:01:00.000Z	SirKillalot	soundray	I'll have to reboot my system, right?
2006-03-11T17:02:00.000Z	soundray	SirKillalot	probably easiest, but you could also run /etc/init.d/keymap.sh and /etc/init.d/console-screen.sh
2006-03-11T17:03:00.000Z	soundray	SirKillalot	and whatever comes out when you grep -l environment /etc/init.d/*
2006-03-11T17:04:00.000Z	SirKillalot	soundray	sorry, It worked
2006-03-11T17:04:00.000Z	SirKillalot	soundray	thank you
2006-03-11T17:04:00.000Z	soundray	SirKillalot	it's possible that aptitude will still speak German to you.
2006-03-11T17:05:00.000Z	soundray	SirKillalot	haven't bothered to find out how to change that.
2006-03-11T17:05:00.000Z	SirKillalot	soundray	no it worked
2006-03-11T17:06:00.000Z	soundray	SirKillalot	oh, well done.
2006-03-11T17:06:00.000Z	soundray	SirKillalot	even aptitude?
