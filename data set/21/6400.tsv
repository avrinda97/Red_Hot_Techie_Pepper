2008-07-10T05:31:00.000Z	Kcaj		I can't even barely use Ubuntu any more
2008-07-10T05:31:00.000Z	Kcaj		It keeps making me log back in if I try to change bindings
2008-07-10T05:31:00.000Z	Kcaj		and wont rotate my screen or anything any more
2008-07-10T05:32:00.000Z	Kcaj		Well anyway, I'm being serious here. I can't close or minimze windows or anything any more. All  ever did was install and start to use Compiz fusion and emerald from synaptic
2008-07-10T05:33:00.000Z	Kcaj		It worked fine for a while., but these days, I have to start in safe mode, then go to normal, and even tyrying to use compiz fusion requires me to keep loging back in (throws me out0 and then never even works right.
2008-07-10T05:33:00.000Z	Kcaj		"Borders"?
2008-07-10T05:33:00.000Z	Kcaj		No, I mean I can File, Edit, etc. but no close, minimize and maximize and such.
2008-07-10T05:35:00.000Z	Kcaj		This problem, has esentially almost completely disabled my OS and made it impossible to use... starting up is a major chore and requires I always go through safe mode first, and repair packages and x server, etc.
2008-07-10T05:36:00.000Z	Kcaj		Any ideas? I have an amazing video card, there is no reason this should be going on, seriously. Really kind of annoying. I want to use Ubuntu bad, but this, and no support for m ywireless card are going to make me forced to switch back to Windows :(
2008-07-10T05:36:00.000Z	Kcaj		Should I really do that? Uninstall and reinstall>?
2008-07-10T05:36:00.000Z	Shujah	Kcaj	 > your graphic card is not recognized or simply compiz is misbehaving?
2008-07-10T05:36:00.000Z	Kcaj		Compiz is misbehaving bad.
2008-07-10T05:37:00.000Z	Kcaj		Some Broadcom, Dell Dual Buand 1490 WLAN minicard
2008-07-10T05:37:00.000Z	Kcaj		I read like 100 tutorials online to make it work, none worked, they all just screwed it up worse I think.
2008-07-10T05:37:00.000Z	Shujah	Kcaj	have you tweaked compiz-setting through advance desktop effects?
2008-07-10T05:37:00.000Z	Kcaj	Shujah	I think it is compiz, I had absolutely no problems before compz, and compiz worked great actually until I did a reboot.
2008-07-10T05:37:00.000Z	Kcaj		Oh, yes, yes, yes I have, but now, I cant even do that. Trying to use compiz, makes me log back in.
2008-07-10T05:38:00.000Z	Kcaj		Okay, I might have to ask you about that again
2008-07-10T05:38:00.000Z	Kcaj		Because I have to close IRC to open anything else, due to my current problem
2008-07-10T05:38:00.000Z	Kcaj		I'm going to close this nor, and remove compiz, and then reinstall, I'll let you guys know how it went.
2008-07-10T05:39:00.000Z	Shujah	Kcaj	using emerald manager with compiz?
