2008-06-09T04:24:00.000Z	graft		unless he's writing his own modules he wants to import...
2008-06-09T04:26:00.000Z	graft		does anyone know why firefox would be unable to resolve domain names? I already disabled ipv6 and it works fine with ping, host, etc. also works fine with konqueror
2008-06-09T04:28:00.000Z	graft		firefox has been trying to resolve www.google.com for twenty minutes now
2008-06-09T04:28:00.000Z	graft		although it isn't actually even attempting a DNS query, so i dunno wtf it's doing
2008-06-09T04:28:00.000Z	musikgoat	graft	can you ping it?
2008-06-09T04:28:00.000Z	graft	musikgoat	yeah, ping works fine
2008-06-09T04:29:00.000Z	graft	musikgoat	as far as i can tell, name resolution works fine 100%... just not in firefox
2008-06-09T04:29:00.000Z	musikgoat	graft	and firefox has problems with other sites too?
2008-06-09T04:29:00.000Z	graft	musikgoat	yep, can't browse anything
2008-06-09T04:29:00.000Z	musikgoat	graft	can ff get to 64.233.167.99?
2008-06-09T04:29:00.000Z	graft	musikgoat	yeah if i give it an IP it works
2008-06-09T04:31:00.000Z	graft	musikgoat	any ideas?

2008-06-09T04:34:00.000Z	musikgoat	graft	thats odd...
