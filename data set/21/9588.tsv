2005-09-23T07:27:00.000Z	butcherbird	todd_	you have sound at all? Music at startup etc?
2005-09-23T07:28:00.000Z	todd_	butcherbird	no, but i can see that something is playing in xmms when im using streamtuner
2005-09-23T07:29:00.000Z	butcherbird	todd_	hoary or breezy install?
2005-09-23T07:29:00.000Z	todd_	butcherbird	breezy
2005-09-23T07:30:00.000Z	todd_	butcherbird	i had hoary installed before and the sound worked, but that was when i had just went from windows to linux.  after hoary i installted suse and from then on no sound
2005-09-23T07:31:00.000Z	todd_	butcherbird	now i have installed breezy to see if the issue is fixed, but no..
2005-09-23T07:32:00.000Z	butcherbird	todd_	do you have onboard sound(motherboard) and a sound card?
2005-09-23T07:32:00.000Z	todd_	butcherbird	yes, its a laptop
2005-09-23T07:37:00.000Z	butcherbird	todd_	not using gnome.  Seveas do you know how to make sure alsa is selcted in gnome. todd_ you might try apt getting libsdl1.2debian-esd if that doesnt work..
2005-09-23T07:38:00.000Z	todd_	butcherbird	ok, thanks
