2012-05-27T21:34:00.000Z	jane_wayne78		i know that but i don't want to buy one just for the install
2012-05-27T21:34:00.000Z	jane_wayne78		(plus i can't wait for the internet)
2012-05-27T21:35:00.000Z	EliahKagan	jane_wayne78	sorry, i didn'
2012-05-27T21:35:00.000Z	EliahKagan		*sorry, i didn't read your 1st post carefully enough
2012-05-27T21:35:00.000Z	jane_wayne78		in fact, the website says the preferred method is the desktop cd/iso
2012-05-27T21:36:00.000Z	EliahKagan		thx spiritech
2012-05-27T21:36:00.000Z	EliahKagan	jane_wayne78	the desktop CD is the preferred way if you want a desktop system...the server CD is the preferred way if you want a dedicated server system that you are not primarily using for desktop use
2012-05-27T21:36:00.000Z	EliahKagan	jane_wayne78	how do you plan to use your Ubuntu system?
2012-05-27T21:37:00.000Z	EliahKagan		hi rifred
2012-05-27T21:37:00.000Z	jane_wayne78	EliahKagan	i wanna learn the Xen and Xen Cloud Platform (XCP)
2012-05-27T21:38:00.000Z	jane_wayne78	EliahKagan	i heard u can do Xen and XCP with "one command line"
2012-05-27T21:38:00.000Z	jane_wayne78		well not heard but read...
2012-05-27T21:38:00.000Z	EliahKagan	jane_wayne78	yeah i don't think you probably want the desktop CD for that, unless you also plan to install a desktop system
2012-05-27T21:38:00.000Z	EliahKagan	jane_wayne78	you might try the mini CD, in case there's something weird going on with the server CD ...but only do that if you have an Internet connection while installing
2012-05-27T21:39:00.000Z	jane_wayne78	EliahKagan	so is the "alternate cd" just the "server ubuntu cd" ?
2012-05-27T21:39:00.000Z	EliahKagan	jane_wayne78	i mean, if nothing else works, go ahead and try with the desktop CD, but you'll get a GUI and stuff
2012-05-27T21:39:00.000Z	EliahKagan		brb
2012-05-27T21:40:00.000Z	jane_wayne78		thanks djones
2012-05-27T21:42:00.000Z	jane_wayne78		i read that the reason why installation hangs for wireless usb is because of driver install, u need the driver installed before you can install, but you can't install without the drivers already there
2012-05-27T21:42:00.000Z	jane_wayne78		that's wierd
2012-05-27T21:44:00.000Z	EliahKagan	jane_wayne78	right, as DJones  says, the server and alternate CD's are different in what packages they install...but unlike versions of Ubuntu previous to 12.04, they now both install the same kernel, so if you choose to install a "minimal system" (from the F4 menu on boot), it's the same with either CD now
