2011-11-20T05:40:00.000Z	jimmy_kash		Hello, is it better to transfer large files between 2 servers via SCP or a VPN
2011-11-20T05:40:00.000Z	ermo	jimmy_kash	are the servers on the same lan or not?
2011-11-20T05:40:00.000Z	jimmy_kash	ermo	No in different countries
2011-11-20T05:41:00.000Z	ermo	jimmy_kash	one time thing or continuous transfer?
2011-11-20T05:41:00.000Z	jimmy_kash	ermo	Continual backup files regularly being checked for and moved.
2011-11-20T05:42:00.000Z	ermo	jimmy_kash	with scp, you use the CPU power of the hosts themselves. With a VPN, you farm out the CPU usage to the equipment running the tunnel
2011-11-20T05:42:00.000Z	ermo	jimmy_kash	so for simplicity, I'd go with scp
2011-11-20T05:43:00.000Z	jimmy_kash	ermo	SCP compresses a file right?  Does this mean it is faster than a normal VPN file copy
2011-11-20T05:43:00.000Z	ermo	jimmy_kash	possibly using PKI w/no password
2011-11-20T05:43:00.000Z	ermo	jimmy_kash	you decide whether compression is used
2011-11-20T05:43:00.000Z	ermo	jimmy_kash	IIRC, that is.
2011-11-20T05:44:00.000Z	jimmy_kash	ermo	So if I was copying a 100mb file over SCP or VPN, SCP has the ability to be faster, it just might use my CPU locally of the sending server more?
2011-11-20T05:45:00.000Z	ermo	jimmy_kash	again, depends on your VPN hardware (whether it's accelerated). Try the scp solution first :)
2011-11-20T05:46:00.000Z	ermo	jimmy_kash	if you can spare the CPU cycles, compress the backups yourself.
2011-11-20T05:46:00.000Z	jimmy_kash	ermo	Are there any other options I should be looking at for regular large file transfer between two ubuntu machines?
2011-11-20T05:47:00.000Z	ermo	jimmy_kash	ssh / scp are so ubiquitous and straightforward to work with that it just adds extra complexity to use e.g. a VPN solution.
2011-11-20T05:47:00.000Z	ermo	jimmy_kash	that's all my personal opinion, of course  :)
2011-11-20T05:48:00.000Z	jimmy_kash	ermo	fair enough mate.  Thanks for your help
2011-11-20T05:50:00.000Z	ermo	jimmy_kash	spot on :)
2011-11-20T05:50:00.000Z	ermo	jimmy_kash	plenty of guides out there for that
2011-11-20T05:50:00.000Z	jimmy_kash	ermo	yeah mr google will provide me with all the info there hopefully
