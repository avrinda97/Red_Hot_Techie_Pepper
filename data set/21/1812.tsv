2010-05-27T03:25:00.000Z	cjdevlin	santisnight	have you ever dual booted? or is this a new endeavor?
2010-05-27T03:27:00.000Z	santisnight	cjdevlin	yeah new endeavor, but my data and everything is backed up safely so...
2010-05-27T03:27:00.000Z	santisnight	cjdevlin	worse comes to worse i scrap it and fresh install XP
2010-05-27T03:28:00.000Z	cjdevlin	santisnight	are you trying to dual boot both from the hard drive?
2010-05-27T03:29:00.000Z	santisnight	cjdevlin	 both from the same hard drive? no. actually my ubuntu is running from an external hard drive.
2010-05-27T03:29:00.000Z	santisnight	cjdevlin	 but the XP is on the master drive internal the computer.
2010-05-27T03:30:00.000Z	cjdevlin	santisnight	i don't know how far you have gotten w/ the research on this, but there were known issues w/ dual booting. xp has to be installed first. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot
2010-05-27T03:30:00.000Z	santisnight	cjdevlin	 i know that and it was.
2010-05-27T03:31:00.000Z	santisnight	cjdevlin	 there is a way to do it pre XP but its annoyingly complicated.
2010-05-27T03:35:00.000Z	santisnight	cjdevlin	 still there?
2010-05-27T03:37:00.000Z	cjdevlin	santisnight	yes
2010-05-27T03:38:00.000Z	santisnight	cjdevlin	 Any ideas?
2010-05-27T03:42:00.000Z	cjdevlin	santisnight	sorry, i was rereading all of the stuff to make sure i have everything straight. you are using ubuntu 9.04, booting xp from the hard drive and ubuntu from an external. you get the windows loader, but when you select xp it doesn't boot?
2010-05-27T03:44:00.000Z	santisnight	cjdevlin	 no i have ubuntu 10.04, and when trying to load from the GRUB 2 loader ubuntu boots fine while XP pro just gets a blinking underscore.
2010-05-27T03:44:00.000Z	santisnight	cjdevlin	 but yes the internal has XP external has linux, and windows fails to load.
