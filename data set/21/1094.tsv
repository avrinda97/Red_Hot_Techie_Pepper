2011-11-30T22:18:00.000Z	recon69_lap	l1nuxman	have you checked for simpler solutions, hard to know how to help with the info you give. maybe the card make model, the version of ubuntu you using and probably lots of other info
2011-11-30T22:20:00.000Z	l1nuxman	recon69_lap	ubuntu 10.04.3 TL-WN821N Atheros USB.

2011-11-30T22:36:00.000Z	recon69_lap	l1nuxman	have you tried just creating the missing file 40-usb_modeswitch.rules.
2011-11-30T22:36:00.000Z	l1nuxman	recon69_lap	I installed usb modeswitch and it created the file. I then added the code
2011-11-30T22:37:00.000Z	l1nuxman	recon69_lap	 any suggestions based on my output?
2011-11-30T22:37:00.000Z	l1nuxman		if nothing atm, I'm going to try and reboot...
2011-11-30T22:39:00.000Z	recon69_lap		 l1nuxman: so you've completed that guide and it's not working
2011-11-30T22:39:00.000Z	l1nuxman		I haven't done any kernel options like I see there though, don't know how
2011-11-30T22:39:00.000Z	l1nuxman	recon69_lap	^
2011-11-30T22:41:00.000Z	recon69_lap	l1nuxman	:) , look like you have to compile the kernel, what fun
2011-11-30T22:42:00.000Z	l1nuxman	recon69_lap	...I"m gonna restart for fun
2011-11-30T22:47:00.000Z	l1nuxman	recon69_lap	:( @ ubuntu
2011-11-30T22:50:00.000Z	recon69_lap	l1nuxman	look like to get this working you going to have to download the kernel source, the build tools, put that film ware in the right place and build a custom kernel. quite a lot of work if you never did it before
2011-11-30T22:51:00.000Z	l1nuxman		wow recon69_lap that sounds like too much...maybe if I found a linux distro that can make it work
2011-11-30T22:55:00.000Z	recon69_lap	l1nuxman	have a read of http://blog.avirtualhome.com/2010/07/14/how-to-compile-a-ubuntu-2-6-35-kernel-for-lucid/
2011-11-30T22:57:00.000Z	recon69_lap	l1nuxman	been a long time since i compiled a kernel, so cant be to sure whats required with ubuntu
2011-11-30T23:03:00.000Z	recon69_lap	l1nuxman	i would also consider how short life is and how inexpensive usb wireless dongles are
