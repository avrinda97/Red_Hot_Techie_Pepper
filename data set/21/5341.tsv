2007-11-03T05:57:00.000Z	Henry6		anyone have a moment to explain why I have no wired network on 7.10?  7.04 worked great...
2007-11-03T05:58:00.000Z	Henry6		not connecting at all.  granted im new at all this but had 7.04 working like a charm
2007-11-03T05:58:00.000Z	noiesmo	Henry6	once i did up grad and eth0 became eth1
2007-11-03T05:59:00.000Z	noiesmo	Henry6	Mine is onboard but they mentioned a file in the etc directory called iftab. It seems that when the linux-image did its upgrade it did not right the correct mac address into this file. ( I don't know why ie bug or something but anyway) to fix it  got the mac address for my device and then I changed the /etc/iftab file so that the eth0 mac entry matched my NIC's mac address, rebooted and hey presto I now have eth0 again.
2007-11-03T06:00:00.000Z	Henry6	noiesmo	possible to shoot me an emial with what to do? or what to look for?
2007-11-03T06:03:00.000Z	noiesmo	Henry6	run the command --- ifconfig
2007-11-03T06:03:00.000Z	noiesmo	Henry6	get mac address of nic
2007-11-03T06:04:00.000Z	Henry6		give me a seconf
2007-11-03T06:04:00.000Z	noiesmo	Henry6	then check what it says in /etc/iftab
2007-11-03T06:04:00.000Z	Henry6		have to switch pc
2007-11-03T06:04:00.000Z	noiesmo	Henry6	if its not match then change it and reboot
2007-11-03T06:04:00.000Z	noiesmo	Henry6	k
2007-11-03T06:06:00.000Z	Henry6		an i able to do this off the livecd?
2007-11-03T06:06:00.000Z	noiesmo	Henry6	yes you can but you will have to mount the drive read/write so you can change the file /etc/iftab
2007-11-03T06:07:00.000Z	Henry6		had to reclaim space from 7.04, thought i did something wrong
2007-11-03T06:08:00.000Z	Henry6		or, should i just reinstall and bother you in 20 minutes?
2007-11-03T06:08:00.000Z	noiesmo	Henry6	sometimes easier its up to you
2007-11-03T06:09:00.000Z	Henry6		your suggestion?  thank you for the q&a session
2007-11-03T06:11:00.000Z	noiesmo	Henry6	if your only issue is the nic and it is mac address related which if you get the mac address and check it against iftab then its one file modified and your running agiain if there are more issues maybe a fresh install will be better for you
2007-11-03T06:11:00.000Z	Henry6		i have the live session up
2007-11-03T06:12:00.000Z	noiesmo	Henry6	ok does the nic work livecd
