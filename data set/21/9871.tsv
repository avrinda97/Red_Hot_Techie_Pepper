2005-12-09T06:32:00.000Z	dabaR	linux_newb	you will need to set up windows to share the connection.
2005-12-09T06:34:00.000Z	dabaR	linux_newb	what do you mean it shows an active connection?
2005-12-09T06:35:00.000Z	dabaR	linux_newb	do you have 2 ethernet cards on the windows computer?
2005-12-09T06:36:00.000Z	dabaR	linux_newb	you can surf with windows
2005-12-09T06:36:00.000Z	dabaR	linux_newb	can you ping between the two boxes?
2005-12-09T06:37:00.000Z	dabaR	linux_newb	ifconfig
2005-12-09T06:46:00.000Z	dabaR	linux_newb	no worries, I was making soup anyhow:)
2005-12-09T06:47:00.000Z	dabaR	linux_newb	did you enable connectiopn sharing on your windows?

2005-12-09T06:49:00.000Z	dabaR	linux_newb	that sounds good. well, did you install a firewall on your ubuntu?
2005-12-09T06:51:00.000Z	dabaR	linux_newb	you can try flushing your firewall rules. sudo iptables --flush
2005-12-09T06:52:00.000Z	dabaR	linux_newb	good work

2005-12-11T12:09:00.000Z	dabaR	linux_newb	what are you installing?>
2005-12-11T12:20:00.000Z	dabaR	linux_newb	it is one of them. if it was the best, everyone would use just that one, and no others would be worth developing.
