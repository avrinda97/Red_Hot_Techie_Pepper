2009-06-10T22:00:00.000Z	Ruby-Rube		Hi, I just tried running a 4d game call Adanaxis and now I can't boot up, the display is messed up. Does anyone know how to recover from this situation without reinstalling??
2009-06-10T22:00:00.000Z	tanath	Ruby-Rube	where do i get me a 4d game?
2009-06-10T22:01:00.000Z	tanath	Ruby-Rube	maybe screen res? try cycling resolution. ctrl alt +/- on keypad is kb shortcut
2009-06-10T22:01:00.000Z	tanath	Ruby-Rube	erm... _4_d?
2009-06-10T22:02:00.000Z	tanath	Ruby-Rube	er, i read your comment in parts... missed the 'can't boot' part
2009-06-10T22:03:00.000Z	tanath	Ruby-Rube	where's it stop booting?
2009-06-10T22:03:00.000Z	tanath	Ruby-Rube	how far do you get before you notice an issue
2009-06-10T22:04:00.000Z	tanath	Ruby-Rube	two? o.O
2009-06-10T22:04:00.000Z	tanath	Ruby-Rube	are you familiar with the bootup process? POST, Operating system boot, etc?
2009-06-10T22:05:00.000Z	tanath	Ruby-Rube	whatever you've changed from default, prolly. unless you have an upgrade version
2009-06-10T22:05:00.000Z	tanath	Ruby-Rube	there are ways to fix these things. if you can find a local linux geek, they might be able to help you
2009-06-10T22:05:00.000Z	tanath	Ruby-Rube	so you get through POST ok, right?
2009-06-10T22:06:00.000Z	tanath	Ruby-Rube	you could try booting to a live disc, and uninstalling the game...
2009-06-10T22:06:00.000Z	tanath	Ruby-Rube	you'd have to mount your hard drive, & chroot to it in terminal
2009-06-10T22:07:00.000Z	tanath	Ruby-Rube	which is why i said to mount your hard drive, and chroot to it in terminal
2009-06-10T22:07:00.000Z	tanath	Ruby-Rube	chroot command: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot
2009-06-10T22:10:00.000Z	tanath	Ruby-Rube	chroot /path/to/mounted/drive
2009-06-10T22:11:00.000Z	tanath	Ruby-Rube	then it'll treat that path as root (/)
2009-06-10T22:11:00.000Z	tanath	Ruby-Rube	and further commands are treated as being run on that system
2009-06-10T22:11:00.000Z	tanath	Ruby-Rube	if it's a linux install that is
2009-06-10T22:12:00.000Z	tanath	Ruby-Rube	np. good luck
