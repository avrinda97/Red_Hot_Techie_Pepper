2007-06-14T11:08:00.000Z	Flannel	cotyrothery	mkdir
2007-06-16T13:33:00.000Z	Flannel	cotyrothery	Install a webserver (apache)
2007-06-16T13:34:00.000Z	cotyrothery	Flannel	yes but how do i get it to work
2007-06-20T10:19:00.000Z	cotyrothery	Flannel	You would have to google it because i dont know how to explain it
2007-06-20T10:17:00.000Z	Flannel	cotyrothery	did you remove with --purge?  (or "complete removal" in synaptic?)  What are screenlets?  User space configuration?  That won't be removed with uninstall, just delete the config file(s) in your homedir.
2007-06-20T10:18:00.000Z	cotyrothery	Flannel	so i need to open up synaptic
2007-06-20T10:18:00.000Z	Flannel	cotyrothery	What are screenlets?
2007-06-20T10:20:00.000Z	Flannel	cotyrothery	you're tryign to get rid of your user configed settings, right?  not global settings?
2007-06-20T10:20:00.000Z	cotyrothery	Flannel	yes for screenlets
2007-06-20T10:21:00.000Z	cotyrothery	Flannel	it says its removing confg files
2007-06-20T10:21:00.000Z	cotyrothery	Flannel	you would like screenlets
2007-06-20T10:21:00.000Z	Flannel	cotyrothery	right.  You'll want to open up your homedir, and remove whatever screenlet configuration files there are (.screenlet maybe?  might be a file or a directory).  You'll need to show hidden files to be able to see it, at any rate.
2007-06-20T10:21:00.000Z	cotyrothery	Flannel	just dont use the mail one
2007-06-20T10:21:00.000Z	cotyrothery	Flannel	how can i see hidden files
2007-06-20T10:22:00.000Z	Flannel	cotyrothery	that "configuration files" are global ones, not user ones.  In nautilus, ctrl-H (maybe it's alt, I dontknow View > Show Hidden Files)
2007-06-20T10:24:00.000Z	cotyrothery	Flannel	there as cool as beryl
2007-07-15T08:46:00.000Z	Flannel	cotyrothery	define integrate
2007-07-15T08:47:00.000Z	cotyrothery	Flannel	I heard of a seamless integration were they run at the same time
2007-07-15T08:47:00.000Z	Flannel	cotyrothery	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SeamlessVirtualization  Might be one solution to what you're looking for
2007-07-15T08:47:00.000Z	cotyrothery	Flannel	I'm on xp now
