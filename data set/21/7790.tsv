2006-09-23T06:40:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	Flannel	I'm a cli fan myself ..
2006-09-23T06:41:00.000Z	Flannel	NineTeen67Comet	right, but it'd have to be her that is one as well, since it shows up in their terminal
2006-09-23T06:41:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	Flannel	aha .. no biggie .. One of my users popped me a message once from my server, to my box here once . I'll have to ask him how he did it ..
2006-09-23T06:42:00.000Z	Flannel	NineTeen67Comet	yeah, you'll need to.  I'm SURE there's some way to do it...
2006-10-28T08:12:00.000Z	Flannel	NineTeen67Comet	1,0
2006-10-28T08:12:00.000Z	Flannel	NineTeen67Comet	same order as linux, just starts from 0, instead of 1 (or 0 instead of a)
2006-10-28T08:16:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	Flannel	I thought so but I keep getting no partition or can't mount or something .. I'll try it again with different numbers ..
2006-10-28T08:17:00.000Z	Flannel	NineTeen67Comet	you shouldn't need to mount anything
2006-10-28T08:17:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	Flannel	that's what I thought .. it's just killing me .. I'm not normally this problematic with linux ..
2006-10-28T08:18:00.000Z	Flannel	NineTeen67Comet	Well, what error does it give you exactly?
2006-10-28T10:15:00.000Z	Flannel	NineTeen67Comet	what error?
2006-10-28T10:16:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	Flannel	I get several different ones .. let me grab a hand full of my "coasters" and see .. lol
2006-10-28T10:16:00.000Z	Flannel	NineTeen67Comet	coasters?  Wait, this is booting from a liveCD that fails? or what?
2006-10-28T10:17:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	Flannel	I would like to NOT touch the windows MBR, instead use a cdrom with grub on it to select with os I want (just like as if I had installed ubuntu with the ms hard drive hooked up)..
2006-10-28T10:18:00.000Z	Flannel	NineTeen67Comet	er... I'm confused.  So, whenever you want to boot ubuntu you have to reboot with a liveCD?
2006-10-28T10:19:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	Flannel	yeah kind of but ubuntu is on the second cd and the ubuntu live cd only has "boot from first hard drive" as a selection .. so I'm building a grub only cd (boot cd) to select the second hd ..
2006-10-28T10:19:00.000Z	Flannel	NineTeen67Comet	you might try the grub 'superdisk' listed on the recveringafterinstallingwindows wiki page, I believe it'll boot from the second HD
2006-10-28T10:21:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	Flannel	yep, had that one, and it doesn't see it either .. that's why I'm asking if grub is already installed if it will still work .. or if I need to point it to my / directory instead of my /boot ..
2006-10-28T10:21:00.000Z	Flannel	NineTeen67Comet	nah, I suppose the other option is to manually edit one of those liveCDs to include hd1,0 as a boot option.  But, really... I'm not entirely sure why you dont want to touch your MBR
2006-10-28T10:22:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	Flannel	because it is my workstation computer at work and I would proptly piss off our Admin ..
