2011-12-29T02:37:00.000Z	graft	Melissa	you need a bootloader... what are you going to replace grub with?
2011-12-29T02:37:00.000Z	Melissa	graft	W7
2011-12-29T02:37:00.000Z	graft	Melissa	just install w7, it'll overwrite grub... you can just format the drive ubuntu is on
2011-12-29T02:37:00.000Z	Melissa	graft	where do I get a bootloader?
2011-12-29T02:38:00.000Z	Melissa	graft	i still get a grub error
2011-12-29T02:38:00.000Z	graft	Melissa	windows has its own, it'll install it
2011-12-29T02:38:00.000Z	Melissa	graft	does this boot CD overwrite grub and replace with windows MBR?  http://www.supergrubdisk.org/category/download/rescatuxdownloads/
2011-12-29T02:39:00.000Z	Melissa	graft	?
2011-12-29T02:39:00.000Z	graft	Melissa	i don't know... but if you install windows, it should install its own boot loader into the MBR
2011-12-29T02:40:00.000Z	graft	Melissa	did you install ubuntu after installing windows?
2011-12-29T02:40:00.000Z	Melissa	graft	yes after
2011-12-29T02:40:00.000Z	Melissa	graft	so what can I do now?
2011-12-29T02:41:00.000Z	graft	Melissa	try google... this is really a windows question. http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ee851681.aspx
2011-12-29T02:41:00.000Z	Melissa	graft	is 64bit Ubuntu any good?
2011-12-29T02:42:00.000Z	graft	Melissa	depends what you mean by 'any good'
2011-12-29T02:42:00.000Z	Melissa	graft	if I use Ubuntu 64bit, can I connect it to my Xbox and stream videos like I can in Windows?
2011-12-29T02:42:00.000Z	graft	Melissa	seems unlikely that xbox integration is going to be better in ubuntu than in windows, but i dunno
2011-12-29T02:42:00.000Z	Melissa	graft	but does it work, connecting ubuntu to xbox?
2011-12-29T02:43:00.000Z	Melissa	graft	I want to record TV on ubuntu and stream the videos to my xbox so I can watch on TV.  Is that possible in Ubuntu?
