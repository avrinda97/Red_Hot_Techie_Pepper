2012-02-15T16:10:00.000Z	kaiowas		Hi, just wondering if anyone here has installed Ubuntu on a Mac and could answer a couple of questions?
2012-02-15T16:11:00.000Z	kaiowas		How much space will Ubuntu take installed? I thought 20gb should be enough for a Ubuntu partition, so i can play around some with it.
2012-02-15T16:12:00.000Z	kaiowas		they are good at compressing those files then ;)
2012-02-15T16:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kaiowas	my full gnome desktop is about 4Gb in size with all the codecs and so forth
2012-04-25T12:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kaiowas	do you have a shortcut to disable/enable it?
2012-04-25T13:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kaiowas	could unload then reload the device module
2012-04-25T13:01:00.000Z	kaiowas	ActionParsnip	assume that im 5 years old and i might understand what you are saying ;). No seriously, do you mean in terminal or in settings?
2012-04-25T13:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kaiowas	try:  sudo modprobe -r psmouse; sleep 3; sudo modprobe psmouse
2012-04-25T13:04:00.000Z	kaiowas	ActionParsnip	no that didn't work :(
2012-04-25T13:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kaiowas	what make and model is the system?
2012-04-25T13:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kaiowas	pay over the odds for a macbook, then run Ubuntu on it. Apple lauging all the way to the bank
2012-04-25T13:07:00.000Z	kaiowas	ActionParsnip	i use OSX alot, i sell Apple computers :). I've installed Ubuntu to learn something new. I like it so far.
2012-04-25T13:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kaiowas	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBook%20Aluminum#Trackpad   did you do that stuff?
2012-04-25T13:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kaiowas	i'd virtualise Ubuntu on your mac, you'll probably have an easier time.
2012-04-25T13:14:00.000Z	kaiowas	ActionParsnip	I did that, but i wanna learn it for real. And to be honest, it was slow when i virtualised it.
2012-04-25T13:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kaiowas	as a mac seller, can you answer me a quick mac question please
2012-04-25T13:14:00.000Z	kaiowas	ActionParsnip	sure i can give it a try.

2012-04-25T13:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kaiowas	I look after servers that cost about that much and they 'just work' too
2012-04-25T13:18:00.000Z	kaiowas	ActionParsnip	I understand that. But if you talk to people that have a Mac Pro, they are usually very very happy with it. Because it does what they want and do it flawlessly. And they had something before that wasnt apple and also "Just worked" but are happier with the Mac Pro. Why? I have no answer, i never use a Mac Pro.
2012-04-25T13:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kaiowas	my Dell D420 does 100% out of the box in Ubuntu....works flawlessly. Probably costs a tiny fraction of your mac thing
