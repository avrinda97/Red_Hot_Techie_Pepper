2006-11-04T14:12:00.000Z	kikokos		what should I do with a "core dumoed" ?
2006-11-04T14:12:00.000Z	kikokos		core dumped...application crashed with this
2006-11-04T14:13:00.000Z	alkali	kikokos	what were you doing when it said this?
2006-11-04T14:13:00.000Z	alkali	kikokos	probably the file itself.  Do other video's or music play fine
2006-11-04T14:15:00.000Z	alkali	kikokos	If other files play fine it may be that the file that caused the crash is corrupt or you do not have the codec required to view it.
2006-11-04T14:16:00.000Z	alkali	kikokos	then it was just that file
2006-11-04T14:17:00.000Z	alkali	kikokos	Basically what it means is there was a failure to read the file and it made the program crash.  And a core dump is done so you don't lose any information or damage your operating system.
2006-11-04T14:18:00.000Z	alkali	kikokos	does that answer your question?
2006-11-04T14:22:00.000Z	alkali	kikokos	You don't see any movies at all?
2006-11-04T14:24:00.000Z	alkali	kikokos	I am unable to see your log.  Can you post it to pastebin?
2006-11-04T14:25:00.000Z	alkali	kikokos	I'm not real good with totem.  I don't recommend using it personally.  I use VLC or XINE.
2006-11-04T14:27:00.000Z	alkali	kikokos	Are you sure you have a dvd drive?
2006-11-04T14:31:00.000Z	alkali	kikokos	did you find out if it was a dvd drive?
2006-11-04T14:33:00.000Z	alkali	kikokos	so you have a dvd-rom drive?
2006-11-04T14:38:00.000Z	alkali	kikokos	did you figure out the make and model of your computer?
2006-11-04T14:43:00.000Z	alkali	kikokos	people with a similar problem did this http://www.ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-194746.html
2006-11-04T14:45:00.000Z	alkali	kikokos	they had to add lines to their xorg.conf file because the player could not play at high resolutions.  Maybe it will work for you
2006-11-04T14:45:00.000Z	alkali	kikokos	or maybe re-installing the nvidia drivers will work.  Who knows.
2006-11-04T14:46:00.000Z	alkali	kikokos	best of luck.  Let me know how it goes
2006-11-04T15:11:00.000Z	alkali	kikokos	they said later in the page it may be a bug in the program so there is currently no solution until they upgrade the program
