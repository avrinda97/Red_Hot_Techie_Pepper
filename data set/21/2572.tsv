2010-11-21T16:15:00.000Z	Beefcakes		Is there any documentation on what a /, a swap and a /home are?
2010-11-21T16:16:00.000Z	Beefcakes		/ = \Windows ?
2010-11-21T16:17:00.000Z	Beefcakes		Okay, more importantly, does Ubuntu do this by default?
2010-11-21T16:17:00.000Z	Beefcakes		I mean, will Ubuntu automatically make these partitions?
2010-11-21T16:18:00.000Z	Beefcakes		Cool. So I'm assuming that's a best practice? Have /swap, / and /home on different partitions?
2010-11-21T16:19:00.000Z	Beefcakes		Alright... wouldn't that be a problem since you can only have 4 partitions on any HD?
2010-11-21T16:20:00.000Z	Beefcakes		Oh, PRIMARY partitions, yes.
2010-11-21T16:20:00.000Z	Beefcakes		Primary partitions = OS'es go herE?
2010-11-21T16:20:00.000Z	Beefcakes		I can insta;; Ubuntu in an extended partitions?
2010-11-21T16:21:00.000Z	Beefcakes		I see, this is great stuff. I never knew a world beyond Windows.
2010-11-21T16:21:00.000Z	Artemis3	Beefcakes	for all that matters, you can have a single "primary" partition, and everything else in logical ones, even other OSes.
2010-11-21T16:21:00.000Z	Beefcakes	Artemis3	Windows in that primary partition I assume? Then I can have my D and Ubuntu in an extended->logical partition?
2010-11-21T16:23:00.000Z	Artemis3	Beefcakes	just make sure you leave unpartitioned space and that should do. Windows doesnt have to use only primary partitions either.
2010-11-21T16:27:00.000Z	Artemis3	Beefcakes	use 100mb+ your physical if you want to hibernate
2010-11-21T16:28:00.000Z	Artemis3	Beefcakes	so 8,1 is enough
2010-11-21T16:29:00.000Z	Artemis3	Beefcakes	a good idea is to split your swap in the 2 HDs, use 4,05g in one, and 4,05g in the other
2010-11-21T16:29:00.000Z	Beefcakes	Artemis3	Unfortunately, they're abstracted to me due to RAID
2010-11-21T16:29:00.000Z	Artemis3	Beefcakes	then never mind
2010-11-21T16:34:00.000Z	Artemis3	Beefcakes	there are 580s now...
2010-11-21T16:34:00.000Z	Beefcakes	Artemis3	*one of the fastest*
2010-11-21T16:38:00.000Z	Artemis3	Beefcakes	linux software raid is in fact a much better option than some cheap fake raid ^^
