2010-01-09T23:58:00.000Z	Xserver		is there a better way to run GUI appz on ubuntu without actually installing GUI ?
2010-01-09T23:59:00.000Z	blakkheim	Xserver	..what?
2010-01-09T23:59:00.000Z	Xserver		application is unattended , so i don't want to waste resource on GUI
2010-01-09T23:59:00.000Z	Xserver	blakkheim	: i need to run an appz in wine on ubuntu server ... but the appz got GUI
2010-01-09T23:59:00.000Z	Xserver		and i want the resource to be minimum ..
2010-01-09T23:59:00.000Z	blakkheim	Xserver	run them through ssh -X?
2010-01-10T00:00:00.000Z	Xserver	blakkheim	: is it persistant ?
2010-01-10T00:00:00.000Z	blakkheim		the graphical app will run on the server but show its interface to the ssh client
2010-01-10T00:01:00.000Z	Xserver	blakkheim	: will the appz remain running if i close the SSH Session ?
2010-01-10T00:01:00.000Z	blakkheim	Xserver	no
2010-01-10T00:01:00.000Z	Xserver		aah... i need some persistant way to run it
2010-01-10T00:02:00.000Z	blakkheim	Xserver	if it was a cli app you could use screen but i don't think gui apps have this ability
2010-01-10T00:02:00.000Z	Xserver		i use screen mostly in cli appz
2010-01-10T00:02:00.000Z	Xserver		but this gui is a pain
2010-01-10T00:03:00.000Z	Xserver		need to devote a lot of resource to gnome / kde
2010-01-10T00:03:00.000Z	Xserver		ok... what is the core gnome stuff i need to install ...
2010-01-10T00:04:00.000Z	Xserver		need no fancy appz
2010-01-10T00:04:00.000Z	blakkheim	Xserver	use a minimal window manager instead of a full DE
2010-01-10T00:04:00.000Z	Xserver		just gnome
2010-01-10T00:04:00.000Z	Xserver	blakkheim	: any idea about the package ? gnome-core ?
2010-01-10T00:04:00.000Z	blakkheim	Xserver	anything gnome-related will be pretty bloated. i would just use something like dwm/awesome/openbox/fluxbox
