2011-09-05T18:24:00.000Z	PeterVenkman		Imark, the Skype client will only allow me to select Pulseaudio in the microphone options
2011-09-05T18:26:00.000Z	PeterVenkman		Is there a special channel for just sound or microphones for Ubuntu?
2011-09-05T18:27:00.000Z	DasEi	PeterVenkman	no, but alsaproject is on the inet, also work through :
2011-09-05T18:28:00.000Z	DasEi	PeterVenkman	mic is often muted per default, read given troubleshooting links, first make sure alsamixergui displays your chip correctly (hint for correct driver inkernel)
2011-09-05T18:29:00.000Z	PeterVenkman	DasEi	already did that.  Mic is on
2011-09-05T18:29:00.000Z	PeterVenkman	DasEi	I've been through the basic troubleshooting what google and ubuntu forums post
2011-09-05T18:31:00.000Z	DasEi	PeterVenkman	mind your s-card is other hardware than your cam's mic
2011-09-05T18:32:00.000Z	PeterVenkman	DasEi	thats what I was thinking...I have two competing IRQs perhaps
2011-09-05T18:32:00.000Z	PeterVenkman	DasEi	how to I get ubuntu to use the Logitech exclusively?
2011-09-05T18:33:00.000Z	DasEi	PeterVenkman	you should, corresponding rather; not at all but to check for unmuting, will have to switch that s-card first (klang/sound)
2011-09-05T18:34:00.000Z	PeterVenkman	DasEi	I have in the audio switches an internal and an external mic and capture option.  Is this what you are refering to?
2011-09-05T18:34:00.000Z	DasEi	PeterVenkman	yes
2011-09-05T18:43:00.000Z	DasEi	PeterVenkman	another try to just get the functional test might be audacious
2011-09-05T18:45:00.000Z	DasEi	PeterVenkman	and chip displayed ? no hints in syslog  ( like unknown device..)
2011-09-05T18:46:00.000Z	PeterVenkman	DasEi	you mean lsusb?
2011-09-05T18:47:00.000Z	DasEi	PeterVenkman	no, I wonder if correct kerneldriver/modul for that mic is loaded
2011-09-05T18:47:00.000Z	DasEi	PeterVenkman	rather a goodie, checkaout :
2011-09-05T18:48:00.000Z	PeterVenkman	DasEi	good idea.  Let me see if the microphone component of this webcam is flagged
2011-09-05T18:48:00.000Z	DasEi	PeterVenkman	sometimes recompiling alsa does the trick, if cam wasn't plugged at install and modules are missing, lookup  yourself both alsa and hcl
2011-09-05T18:49:00.000Z	PeterVenkman	DasEi	 I could reinstall Xubuntu with cam plugged in as a last resort
2011-09-05T18:50:00.000Z	DasEi	PeterVenkman	very last, common hw http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Main_Page
