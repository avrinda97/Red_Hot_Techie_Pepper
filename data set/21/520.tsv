2011-10-27T09:26:00.000Z	bobweaver	MeganLWoulffe	try dmesg|less   then hit /battery    then enter

2011-10-27T09:39:00.000Z	bobweaver	MeganLWoulffe	yes I did and am a little suprised tthat it has not been updated with that kerenel
2011-10-27T09:39:00.000Z	MeganLWoulffe	bobweaver	me too to be honest. I'm a linux noobie, but it seems every distro I try has the same issue
2011-10-27T09:42:00.000Z	MeganLWoulffe	bobweaver	would it help if I mentioned that my screen brightness never sticks on reboot? always goes to half brightness
2011-10-27T09:46:00.000Z	bobweaver	MeganLWoulffe	 it really looks like DSDT  file is umm.....
2011-10-27T09:46:00.000Z	bobweaver	MeganLWoulffe	cat /proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/state
2011-10-27T09:48:00.000Z	MeganLWoulffe	bobweaver	that's another thing, I don't have BAT0, only BAT1 and it says present: no
2011-10-27T09:48:00.000Z	bobweaver	MeganLWoulffe	at least there is solution
2011-10-27T09:49:00.000Z	MeganLWoulffe	bobweaver	Oh? And what might that be?
