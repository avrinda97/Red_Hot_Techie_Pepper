2009-12-26T02:54:00.000Z	P1R11		My usb drive is not showing anymore, I have important files there..Is anyone able to help me?
2009-12-26T02:55:00.000Z	Zlobi1	P1R11	Try Disk Mounter, if on Gnome
2009-12-26T03:05:00.000Z	P1R11	Zlobi1	I try to mount it, but I cant. I do get this message when I plug it in "[sda] Assuming drive cache: write through"
2009-12-26T03:07:00.000Z	P1R11	Zlobi1	Its possible
2009-12-26T03:07:00.000Z	P1R11	Zlobi1	Please tell me that I can recover the data...Its really important
2009-12-26T03:07:00.000Z	Zlobi1	P1R11	Either finda win PC and safe remove or check for a forcr mount command in google
2009-12-26T03:18:00.000Z	P1R11	Zlobi1	I did it, when to windows, unistall and install de usb drive, detected, and it shows now, but if I try to access it, it said that it doesnt have a format, and that I should format it....Is there anything I can do beside formating the usb drive
2009-12-26T03:27:00.000Z	P1R11	Zlobi1	I did it, I went to windows, uninstall and install de usb drive. Windows detected it, and it shows now in MyPC, but if I try to access it, it said that it doesnt have a format, and that I should format it....Is there anything I can do beside formating the usb drive
2009-12-26T03:27:00.000Z	Zlobi1	P1R11	Yes, there was a wonderful Linux respore program, which name I forgot
2009-12-26T03:28:00.000Z	P1R11	Zlobi1	Could it be Photorec?
2009-12-26T03:28:00.000Z	Zlobi1	P1R11	Was running in 80*30 window
2009-12-26T03:28:00.000Z	Zlobi1	P1R11	No
2009-12-26T03:31:00.000Z	Zlobi1	P1R11	While I was trying different linux distros, Fedora did similar stuff to mine 1TB internal drive
2009-12-26T03:31:00.000Z	Zlobi1	P1R11	The program fixed all, it is available with apt-get, but I forgot the name :(
2009-12-26T03:32:00.000Z	P1R11	Zlobi1	The problem is that I was backing up a PC, but I was moving, not copying the files, so now I will lose them
2009-12-26T03:32:00.000Z	Zlobi1	P1R11	Was starting with a ? about type of machine, ~ 10 choices
2009-12-26T03:32:00.000Z	Zlobi1	P1R11	That's why you copy first, then delete the orig
2009-12-26T03:33:00.000Z	P1R11	Zlobi1	I learn that the hard way
2009-12-26T03:33:00.000Z	Zlobi1	P1R11	Me too, but I share my mistakes :)
2009-12-26T03:35:00.000Z	Zlobi1	P1R11	check http://linux.software.informer.com/download-linux-fix-disk-utility/
2009-12-26T03:47:00.000Z	P1R11	Zlobi1	Finally I format it hoping for the best. Now I am trying to recover as much data as possible with photorec :(
