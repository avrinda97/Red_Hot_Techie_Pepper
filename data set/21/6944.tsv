2007-04-22T12:39:00.000Z	nemo_home		Hey. I have a moderately complex 7.04 upgrade issue.
2007-04-22T12:40:00.000Z	nemo_home		My mom's boyfriend switched off (powered off) her laptop while I was installing some stuff on it once. this damaged portions of ubuntu package manager, after some struggling I got it almost back to normal 'cept it had no clue what packages were already installed...
2007-04-22T12:41:00.000Z	nemo_home		The 7.04 update, as a result, failed with error that it had no idea what desktop was installed.
2007-04-22T12:41:00.000Z	nemo_home		I went ahead and "reinstalled" ubuntu-desktop and all its dependancies, but now the 7.04 upgrade button no longer appears
2007-04-22T12:41:00.000Z	liquiddoom	nemo_home	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop for starters?
2007-04-22T12:41:00.000Z	nemo_home	liquiddoom	done :-p
2007-04-22T12:41:00.000Z	nemo_home	liquiddoom	see above :)
2007-04-22T12:42:00.000Z	nemo_home	liquiddoom	I'd like to avoid a manual 7.04 update, I'd like to know how to get the pretty lil' upgrade tool back
2007-04-22T12:42:00.000Z	liquiddoom	nemo_home	Are you using the feisty repos?
2007-04-22T12:43:00.000Z	nemo_home	liquiddoom	at the moment. probably not? it halted in the middle of upgrading, as stated. aborted on figuring out what it needed to do.
2007-04-22T12:43:00.000Z	nemo_home	liquiddoom	one sec. can check though
2007-04-22T12:43:00.000Z	liquiddoom	nemo_home	It might not want to start again if it went to the feisty repos, not too sure though
2007-04-22T12:44:00.000Z	nemo_home	liquiddoom	memory jogger on where those are?
2007-04-22T12:45:00.000Z	nemo_home	liquiddoom	am not an ubuntu person normally, and haven't had to mess with it in months
2007-04-22T12:45:00.000Z	liquiddoom	nemo_home	/etc/apt/sources.list/
2007-04-22T12:46:00.000Z	nemo_home	liquiddoom	sources are still edgy - mod timestamp of today, and some files in /etc/apt that look like leftovers from the aborted upgrade
2007-04-22T12:46:00.000Z	nemo_home	liquiddoom	probably reverted when it aborted
2007-04-22T12:49:00.000Z	nemo_home	liquiddoom	tired and time for bed. will poke at this tomorrow. any idea what might trigger the restart though?
2007-04-22T12:49:00.000Z	liquiddoom	nemo_home	I'm not too sure
2007-04-22T12:49:00.000Z	liquiddoom	nemo_home	I'll try to help out further tomorrow
2007-04-22T12:50:00.000Z	nemo_home	liquiddoom	thanks. g'nite. silly installer shouldn't leave itself in an unreturnable state. but then. if he hadn't damaged the filesystem all those months ago..
