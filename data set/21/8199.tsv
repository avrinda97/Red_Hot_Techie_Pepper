2006-10-17T12:35:00.000Z	Shadow_mil	sktrdie	yes
2006-10-17T12:35:00.000Z	Shadow_mil	sktrdie	are you in X-Caht?
2006-10-17T12:57:00.000Z	Shadow_mil	sktrdie	you in xchat?
2006-10-17T12:58:00.000Z	sktrdie	Shadow_mil	yes
2006-10-17T12:58:00.000Z	Shadow_mil	sktrdie	type   /exec -o ls /dev/sd*
2006-10-17T12:59:00.000Z	sktrdie	Shadow_mil	basically the files reside in /dev/sdb1 but I don;t know why it mounts /dev/sdc
2006-10-17T13:01:00.000Z	Shadow_mil	sktrdie	not sure
2006-10-17T13:01:00.000Z	Shadow_mil	sktrdie	I would leave it be and be happy
2006-10-17T13:02:00.000Z	sktrdie	Shadow_mil	why?
2006-10-17T13:02:00.000Z	Shadow_mil	sktrdie	if it works
2006-10-17T13:02:00.000Z	Shadow_mil	sktrdie	don't try to fix it if it anti broken
2006-10-17T13:03:00.000Z	sktrdie	Shadow_mil	I need to boot from it, and it won't let me so I figured that's the problem
2006-10-17T13:03:00.000Z	Shadow_mil	sktrdie	it might be a problem with your BIOS, check out your BIOS settings
2006-10-17T13:04:00.000Z	sktrdie	Shadow_mil	when I boot from USB is says that it cannot because the image is corrupted. even though it should work, so I figured is probably the problem of the devices showing up
2006-10-17T13:05:00.000Z	Shadow_mil	sktrdie	I don't know anything about booting to USB I am sorry
2006-10-17T13:16:00.000Z	Shadow_mil	sktrdie	booting to USB has more to do with your BIOS then your OS
2006-10-17T13:17:00.000Z	sktrdie	Shadow_mil	I know, but I've setup the Boot IMAGE so I need to know
