2012-04-02T17:09:00.000Z	foo357		Hello
2012-04-02T17:09:00.000Z	foo357		I am forced to do some manual installation of packages
2012-04-02T17:10:00.000Z	foo357		python-wxgtk2.8 and python-wxversion depend upon eachother, how should I install these packages?
2012-04-02T17:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	foo357	You could force install one then immediately install the other. I suggest you report a bug too
2012-04-02T17:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	foo357	actually
2012-04-02T17:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	foo357	try:  sudo apt-get install python-wxgtk2.8 python-wxversion
2012-09-25T12:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	foo357	do you have a desktop UI?
2012-09-25T12:48:00.000Z	foo357	ActionParsnip	yes
2012-09-25T12:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	foo357	use gnome-schedule     or to cron as root run:  gksudo gnome-schedule
2012-09-25T12:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	foo357	waaaay easier :)
2012-09-25T12:50:00.000Z	foo357	ActionParsnip	I'm really just doing a simple thing. A guy has adviced me to add the line "@reboot /path/to/pg_ctl -D /path/to/PGDATA start" to crontab. But I have virtually zero experience of cron.
2012-09-25T12:51:00.000Z	foo357	ActionParsnip	so is it the file /etc/crontab? And is it just as simple as adding this line at the end?
2012-09-25T12:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	foo357	oh then use crontab :)
2012-09-25T12:51:00.000Z	foo357	ActionParsnip	It's part of installing some server software.
2012-09-25T12:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	foo357	does the command need root access?
2012-09-25T12:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	foo357	you can run:  sudo crontab -e     and add the line as you need
2012-09-25T12:52:00.000Z	foo357	ActionParsnip	umm no I believe that the explicit purpose is to circumvent root acess
2012-09-25T12:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	foo357	then just run:  crontab -e    and you can add the line
2012-09-25T12:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	foo357	commads in: crontab -e   will run as user
2012-09-25T13:00:00.000Z	foo357	ActionParsnip	how should the crontab command look like, I tried with: "sudo -u <user> -e <the string> "
2012-09-25T13:00:00.000Z	foo357	ActionParsnip	crontab went missing there
