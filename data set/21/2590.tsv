2009-08-31T00:59:00.000Z	aj_444		I ran the update manager earlier today. Before I did it, ubuntu booted up by itself and no GRUB menu was present. Now, however, I have a choice between two ubuntu's (they have the same ver. # after them) and two recovery options. Is there a way I can get it to boot up without displaying the GRUB menu?
2009-08-31T00:59:00.000Z	Slart	aj_444	there is a program called "startup manager" you can install from the repos.. it has settings for showing grub or not, amongst others
2009-08-31T01:00:00.000Z	aj_444	Slart	thanks. I'll check it out.
2009-08-31T01:14:00.000Z	aj_444	Slart	I downloaded the startup manager, but  I can't find where to turn off the grub screen.
2009-08-31T01:15:00.000Z	Slart	aj_444	hmm.. try the "Show bootloader menu" option
2009-08-31T01:16:00.000Z	aj_444	Slart	I don't believe I have that option.
2009-08-31T01:16:00.000Z	Slart	aj_444	on the first tab? at the bottom there is three checkboxes?
2009-08-31T01:17:00.000Z	Slart	aj_444	the tab is called "Boot options"
2009-08-31T01:17:00.000Z	Slart	aj_444	oh.. perhaps you need something else to be installed before it shows that option.. weird..
2009-08-31T01:18:00.000Z	aj_444	Slart	Yup. I see it. In the Misc Section, I have show boot splash and show text during boot
2009-08-31T01:18:00.000Z	Slart	aj_444	hmm.. before those two I have "Show bootloader menu" checkbox.. strange
2009-08-31T01:18:00.000Z	Slart	aj_444	well.. we can do it manually then..
2009-08-31T01:19:00.000Z	aj_444	Slart	I have no idea how to do anything manually in ubuntu. xD
2009-08-31T01:19:00.000Z	Slart	aj_444	run this in a terminal "gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst"
2009-08-31T01:20:00.000Z	Slart	aj_444	the file you're seeing now is the main configuration file for grub.. with all the kernels available, settings for them and so on
2009-08-31T01:20:00.000Z	aj_444	Slart	All I see is hiddenmenu
2009-08-31T01:21:00.000Z	Slart	aj_444	that's the one.. remove the # before it.. so it says        hiddenmenu     instead of      #hiddenmenu
2009-08-31T01:21:00.000Z	aj_444	Slart	there's no # in front of it
2009-08-31T01:22:00.000Z	Slart	aj_444	huh.. and you still get the grub menu? the one with the kernel and a recovery mode and perhaps a memtest option?
2009-08-31T01:25:00.000Z	aj_444	Slart	Well, I have a like 2.6.6 and a 2.6.8 or something like that. I ran the update manager earlier today. It started doing this after I updated
2009-08-31T01:26:00.000Z	Slart	aj_444	ok.. lets try this.. open a terminal.. run "sudo update-grub" ... it will take a couple of seconds or more.. let it run.. then try rebooting and see if the menu is still there
