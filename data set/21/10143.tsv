2005-09-28T14:24:00.000Z	Almindor		is libc package broken in breezy?
2005-09-28T14:24:00.000Z	bob2	Almindor	why do you think that?
2005-09-28T14:25:00.000Z	bob2	Almindor	when running...
2005-09-28T14:26:00.000Z	Almindor	bob2	when linking
2005-09-28T14:26:00.000Z	bob2	Almindor	when linking *what*?
2005-09-28T14:28:00.000Z	Almindor	bob2	explain please, was dlopen() moved out of libc?
2005-09-28T14:29:00.000Z	bob2	Almindor	what? no
2005-09-28T14:30:00.000Z	Almindor	bob2	you sayed "then you've already lost" what did you mean by that?
2005-09-28T14:30:00.000Z	bob2	Almindor	I thought you were trying to dlopen() libc6 itself
2005-09-28T14:30:00.000Z	Almindor	bob2	nah :)
2005-09-28T14:31:00.000Z	bob2	Almindor	put the error in #flood or something
2005-09-28T14:32:00.000Z	Almindor	bob2	I think I found the cause..
2005-09-28T15:11:00.000Z	Almindor	bob2	it seems 2.3.5 has only __libc_dlclose while 2.3.4 also has _dl_close
2005-09-28T15:13:00.000Z	bob2	Almindor	you're really only using dlclose()?
2005-09-28T15:13:00.000Z	bob2	Almindor	touching symbols starting with _ sounds like something only people who hack libc should be doing
2005-09-28T15:15:00.000Z	Almindor	bob2	It's from another language
2005-09-28T15:15:00.000Z	Almindor	bob2	they link to libc to use dlclose() etc.
2005-09-28T15:16:00.000Z	Almindor	bob2	seems like there were symbol changes between 2.3.4 and 2.3.5 regarding it tho
2005-09-28T15:16:00.000Z	bob2	Almindor	what language is this?
2005-09-28T15:16:00.000Z	Almindor	bob2	object pascal
2005-09-28T15:16:00.000Z	Almindor	bob2	hah?
