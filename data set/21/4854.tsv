2008-04-15T16:12:00.000Z	unop_	g[r]eek	thereby not allowing the system to go through runlevel S/6 (??) and do a proper shutdown
2008-04-15T16:07:00.000Z	unop_	g[r]eek	it's a rescue shell basically -- you are taken to it if the system cannot do a normal boot
2008-04-15T16:08:00.000Z	g[r]eek	unop_	And it fails to do a normal boot because? I'm assuming because of the hard stop as mjbrooks put it?
2008-04-15T16:09:00.000Z	unop_	g[r]eek	 well, the only way to find out quite definitively would be to examine the log files and dmesg -- yea, i suspect the hard stop really does bork something or the other
2008-04-15T16:09:00.000Z	unop_	g[r]eek	what do you have to do to get the system to boot normally once you see this prompt?
2008-04-15T16:09:00.000Z	g[r]eek	unop_	Heh, I just press ctrl + alt + del and it boots fine
2008-04-15T16:11:00.000Z	unop_	g[r]eek	it could be that the BIOS has an option to shut off the computer right away (or with a short delay) once the power button is pressed
2008-04-15T16:13:00.000Z	unop_	g[r]eek	why don't you educate the user to shutdown the machine properly? :) and yea, a script would be nice
2008-04-15T16:13:00.000Z	g[r]eek	unop_	Yeah but I was hoping to not clutter the server room with a monitor and mouse...
2008-04-15T16:14:00.000Z	g[r]eek	unop_	I like the idea of a auto-triggered script  - it might be complicated to set up the first time but I can use it on all my clients going forward
2008-04-15T16:14:00.000Z	unop_	g[r]eek	he could do it remotely too -- but anyway, better to used UPS to its full potential
2008-04-15T16:15:00.000Z	g[r]eek	unop_	Lol, I should introduce you to my client - you'd then understand why this isn't an option :)
2008-04-15T16:15:00.000Z	unop_	g[r]eek	the UPS howto should give you an idea about how this is done .. atleast you know how feasible it is then
2008-04-15T16:15:00.000Z	unop_	g[r]eek	:)
2008-04-15T16:16:00.000Z	g[r]eek	unop_	By UPS howto I assume you are reffering to the badly translated manual that shipped with the device, and not some awesome ubuntu command that does everything forme
2008-04-15T16:16:00.000Z	unop_	g[r]eek	it's a TLDP document
2008-04-15T16:16:00.000Z	g[r]eek	unop_	TLDP?
2008-04-15T16:17:00.000Z	unop_	g[r]eek	the linux doc. project .. see tldp.org :)
2008-04-15T16:17:00.000Z	unop_	g[r]eek	tldp.org/HOWTO/UPS-HOWTO/
2008-04-15T16:19:00.000Z	g[r]eek	unop_	Nice. Thanks for all the help. Off for lunch. I'll be back if I run into problems later :)
