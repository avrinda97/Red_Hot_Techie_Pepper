2010-12-14T12:16:00.000Z	soapcontainer		how do i completely remove all traces of google chrome and any malicious software or configuration changes it may have made to my system
2010-12-14T12:18:00.000Z	soapcontainer		yep
2010-12-14T12:18:00.000Z	soapcontainer		gonna have to reformat then
2010-12-14T12:18:00.000Z	soapcontainer		I mean that if you install google chrome, you install what is effectively a botnet apparatus
2010-12-14T12:18:00.000Z	soapcontainer		which COULD be used in the same way as a traditional botnet, if google so chose
2010-12-14T12:18:00.000Z	soapcontainer		it has that ability
2010-12-14T12:19:00.000Z	soapcontainer		thanks TeslaTony
2010-12-14T12:19:00.000Z	soapcontainer		don't have a music player on this machine noonian
2010-12-14T12:19:00.000Z	soapcontainer		on this machine i can't take risks
2010-12-14T12:19:00.000Z	soapcontainer		thought google chrome was completely ok but it wasn't
2010-12-14T12:19:00.000Z	i8degrees	soapcontainer	yet IRC is considered safe? :]
2010-12-14T12:21:00.000Z	i8degrees	soapcontainer	*laughs* alright...
2010-12-14T12:21:00.000Z	soapcontainer	i8degrees	why do you think irc is unsafe?
2010-12-14T12:22:00.000Z	i8degrees	soapcontainer	first, I'd like to know why google chrome is unsafe / a botnet :-)
2010-12-14T12:28:00.000Z	soapcontainer	i8degrees	http://www.precursorblog.com/content/google-chrome-we-dont-need-your-permission
2010-12-14T12:39:00.000Z	i8degrees	soapcontainer	that article you linked me to is trolling hardcore with a horridly biased and otherwise flat out *wrong* take on the auto-update feature all together
2010-12-14T12:40:00.000Z	i8degrees	soapcontainer	...it is not as if Google has to communicate with your computer to issue out a patch / download for updating with
2010-12-14T12:43:00.000Z	i8degrees	soapcontainer	err, that's not quite what I meant to say *laughs* ...Google's Adobe Flash binary is special in that they do additional engineering work beyond that of merely using nswrapper for integration into the browser and thus they must handle the updates Adobe issues out further.
2010-12-14T12:45:00.000Z	soapcontainer	i8degrees	if one of their updates caused an error how would you find out?
2010-12-14T12:45:00.000Z	i8degrees	soapcontainer	so it actually is a bit as if chrome phones home with Google in order to check if there is a new version available, but that in of itself does not create a botnet. it certainly creates an inherit risk as with all network oriented I/O, but other than the tid bit involving not first asking the user beforehand, it is, for all practical purposes, identical to how any other piece of software handles all this
2010-12-14T12:48:00.000Z	i8degrees	soapcontainer	you'd notice the manifestation of the bug as the result. as to how to run diagnostics, there's various methods in route to this :] in either regard, you can look at the plugins via 'about:plugins' if typed into the address bar
