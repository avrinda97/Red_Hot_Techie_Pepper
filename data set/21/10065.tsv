2005-08-29T06:06:00.000Z	GoClick		How hard is it to get an Ubuntu install to make /home on /dev/hdb1 ?
2005-08-29T06:06:00.000Z	cafuego	GoClick	trivial.
2005-08-29T06:07:00.000Z	cafuego	GoClick	In the installer, choose advanced partitioning, create the raid1 in the installer, format and mount it (or just format and mount, if it's hardware (promise/highpoint is NOT hardware, do not use))
2005-08-29T06:08:00.000Z	GoClick	cafuego	no it's a Dell PowerEdge
2005-08-29T06:08:00.000Z	cafuego	GoClick	Then it ought to just pick up the array. In the aprtition setup, choose hdb1 and tell the system to mount it on /home
2005-08-29T06:09:00.000Z	GoClick	cafuego	cool, and if the raid controler isn't found?
2005-08-29T06:09:00.000Z	cafuego	GoClick	Then you probably have a dell poweredge ;-)
2005-08-29T06:09:00.000Z	cafuego	GoClick	Which controller (specifically) is it?
2005-08-29T06:10:00.000Z	GoClick	cafuego	I don't know let me look into that...
2005-08-29T06:14:00.000Z	GoClick	cafuego	I can't say for sure it's whatever the SATA RAID controller on the Dell PowerEdge 800 us :/
2005-08-29T06:16:00.000Z	cafuego	GoClick	CERC or PERC
2005-08-29T06:17:00.000Z	GoClick	cafuego	with the cost of the server and the cost of the controlers I doubt it's one of them
2005-08-29T06:17:00.000Z	cafuego	GoClick	No, it's a dell.
2005-08-29T06:18:00.000Z	cafuego	GoClick	The Model 800 comes with either a CERC or a PERC.
2005-08-29T06:19:00.000Z	GoClick	cafuego	it says it's onboard SATA RAID tho where as the CERC and PERC controlers are cards for sale, if it's onboard why bother buying one?
2005-08-29T06:20:00.000Z	cafuego	GoClick	If it's a raid controller, it'll be the CERC. the on-board one is just flat sata.
2005-08-29T06:21:00.000Z	GoClick	cafuego	ok because it was ordered with a two disk RAID1 no OS configuration
2005-08-29T06:23:00.000Z	cafuego	GoClick	the 2.6.12 kernel at a minimum supports the CERC controller by way of the aacraid driver. I'm sure 2.6.10 would too.
2005-09-03T05:39:00.000Z	cafuego	GoClick	ln -s /real/file  /sym/link
2005-09-03T05:45:00.000Z	GoClick	cafuego	I think he'll have an awfully hard time setting up a direct connection
2005-09-03T05:45:00.000Z	cafuego	GoClick	Why would that be harder then a switch?
