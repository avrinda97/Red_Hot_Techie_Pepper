2012-02-19T13:05:00.000Z	Corey	Suppa_Spic	Talk to the WINE folks.
2012-02-19T13:05:00.000Z	Corey	Suppa_Spic	Was there anything else?
2012-02-19T13:06:00.000Z	Suppa_Spic	Corey	where I can contact the wine folks
2012-02-19T13:12:00.000Z	Corey	Suppa_Spic	If gaming is your primary use case, this probably isn't the OS for you.
2012-02-19T13:14:00.000Z	Corey	Suppa_Spic	Enough of that line of questioning, please.
2012-02-19T13:16:00.000Z	Suppa_Spic	Corey	I stopped
2012-02-19T13:30:00.000Z	Corey	Suppa_Spic	Good luck, have fun.
2012-02-19T13:31:00.000Z	Corey	Suppa_Spic	Although #mint is where support for that goes.
2012-02-19T13:32:00.000Z	Suppa_Spic	Corey	oh ok
2012-02-19T13:32:00.000Z	Suppa_Spic	Corey	What?
2012-02-19T13:32:00.000Z	Corey	Suppa_Spic	Not sure where their support forum is.
