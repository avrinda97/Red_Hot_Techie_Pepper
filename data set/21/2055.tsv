2010-04-30T17:30:00.000Z	krambiorix		i can't let my 2 network interfaces ( wired and wireless) work simultaneously
2010-04-30T17:31:00.000Z	krambiorix		if my wireless (not connected) is up, i can't use my wireless to access the internet
2010-04-30T17:31:00.000Z	krambiorix		when i bring up my wired my internet connection stalls
2010-04-30T17:32:00.000Z	hipitihop	krambiorix	but works if you disable your wireless ?
2010-04-30T17:32:00.000Z	krambiorix	hipitihop	: well the problem is when that my wired always works but when i put my wired interface up, i don't have internet connection anymore via my wireless
2010-04-30T17:34:00.000Z	krambiorix	hipitihop	: can you help me to figure out what the problem is?
2010-04-30T17:34:00.000Z	hipitihop	krambiorix	sounds like a routing issue but I don't know enough how to tweak those... do you actually need to use both simultaneously ?
2010-04-30T17:35:00.000Z	hipitihop	krambiorix	or is one at a time sufficient as long as your internet connect works
2010-04-30T17:35:00.000Z	krambiorix	hipitihop	i need to let them work both, my cisco phone is connected to my laptop
2010-04-30T17:38:00.000Z	hipitihop	krambiorix	sounds a little more involved then I can help with sorry. .. I was going to suggest using wicd instead of normal network manager as it makes it easier to manage your connections, and defaults but I don't know enough to help you with your simultaneous problem
2010-04-30T17:39:00.000Z	krambiorix	hipitihop	i just see that it's Firefox that looses the connection
2010-04-30T17:40:00.000Z	hipitihop	krambiorix	how do you know the connection is lost and not just dns or other issues.
2010-04-30T17:40:00.000Z	krambiorix	hipitihop	you're right, i don't, it's just firefox i think
2010-04-30T17:41:00.000Z	hipitihop	krambiorix	is you phone a voip phone ?
2010-04-30T17:42:00.000Z	krambiorix	hipitihop	it's a SIP phone
2010-04-30T17:42:00.000Z	hipitihop	krambiorix	and it's connected using ethernet to your laptop ?
2010-04-30T17:43:00.000Z	krambiorix	hipitihop	yes
2010-04-30T17:43:00.000Z	hipitihop	krambiorix	and your internet is provided by your wireless AP ?
2010-04-30T17:43:00.000Z	krambiorix	hipitihop	yes
2010-04-30T17:45:00.000Z	hipitihop	krambiorix	your wireless AP has no wired ports ?
