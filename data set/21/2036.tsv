2010-06-14T00:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mushy1	you may have to enable the universe repo in software sources

2010-06-14T00:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mushy1	my bad. you can see where i mixed up
2010-06-14T00:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mushy1	sorry
2010-06-14T00:56:00.000Z	mushy1	ActionParsnip	mousty isnt me
2010-06-14T01:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mushy1	if you add a startup item to replace the WM at startup it will be fine
2010-06-14T01:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mushy1	add an entry in startup items to run:   openbox --replace     or whatever WM you wish to use
2010-06-14T01:19:00.000Z	mushy1	ActionParsnip	--replace closes what it uses?
2010-06-14T01:20:00.000Z	mushy1	ActionParsnip	is this the WM:  Netbook Launcher  A Clutter-based desktop launcher   or if i run a different WM this will still open? in startup apps i do not see the current WM
2010-06-14T01:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mushy1	the WM will simply run alongside the NBR. You need to choose the gnome desktop instead of the netbook launcher just before login. Click your username then look at the bottom of the screen
2010-06-14T01:22:00.000Z	mushy1	ActionParsnip	do i need to logoff and close all my open apps to go back and select a different WM on the login screen?
2010-06-14T02:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mushy1	my .dmrc doesn't have that in dude, you usually set the desktop when you log in
2010-06-14T02:08:00.000Z	mushy1	ActionParsnip	my .dmrc has Session=gnome, I am trying to avoid doing it the graphical way, also what if i want to change the display manager to xfce's default display manager
2010-06-14T02:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mushy1	well, its free to try. You can always re-edit the file
