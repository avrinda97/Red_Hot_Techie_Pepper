2007-04-08T10:44:00.000Z	mana		GeekCHick the Mobility Radeons are among the ATI cards the least supported
2007-04-08T10:45:00.000Z	mana		thier drivers are below average ati quality
2007-04-08T10:45:00.000Z	GeekChick|	mana	unfortunately most laptops seem to have these cards.
2007-04-08T10:45:00.000Z	mana		so maybe you have a buggy card that opensource software cant fix
2007-04-08T10:45:00.000Z	mana		GeekCHick i know ...
2007-04-08T10:45:00.000Z	mana		i used to onw a laptop with an x600
2007-04-08T10:46:00.000Z	GeekChick|	mana	no it is not buggy. it runs supreme commander under windows xp sp2 just fine.
2007-04-08T10:46:00.000Z	mana		sure GeekChick but the drivers they write for Linux are so buggy
2007-04-08T10:46:00.000Z	GeekChick|	mana	do you have one of the cards? have you gotten it to work with decent speeds for playing back full screen podcast videos, etc....?
2007-04-08T10:47:00.000Z	mana		ask the guys on the Nexuiz forum, they confirmed that there was a unusual crash with my card/driver .. so maaaybe yours has errors like that
2007-04-08T10:47:00.000Z	mana		GeekChick no i dont touch ATI anymore :)
2007-04-08T10:47:00.000Z	mana		but everything apart from openGL went fine with my mobility card
2007-04-08T10:47:00.000Z	mana		had no problems with the blender openGL gui too
2007-04-08T10:48:00.000Z	GeekChick|		Does anyone here run an ATI X1300 or X1400 video card in their laptop and have fglrx drivers running well? I cant do anything like playing a podcast anywhere near full screen, nor get more than a couple frames per second on glxgears.
2007-04-08T10:49:00.000Z	mana		hehe write cp in small letters
2007-04-08T10:49:00.000Z	mana		sorry

2007-04-08T10:53:00.000Z	GeekChick|	mana	do you have one of the cards? have you gotten it to work with decent speeds for playing back full screen podcast videos, etc....?
