2009-04-26T09:11:00.000Z	maxxist		off topic router problem.  I can no longer log into my router through firefox.  it gives me an invalid certificate error.  anyone know where my certificates are stored so I can remove it and get a new one from my router???
2009-04-26T09:12:00.000Z	digitalchemist	maxxist	isn't there a link toward the bottom of that page that let's you add the exception?
2009-04-26T09:13:00.000Z	maxxist	digitalchemist	no it just says try again.  and I looked in my certificates under prefernces and there is none listed.  this is not just an ubuntu problem.  firefox in windoze has the same issue.  but i can log in from internet exploder.
2009-04-26T09:15:00.000Z	maxxist	digitalchemist	this all started after i updated the firmware on the router.  it must have generated a new certificate for itself????
2009-04-26T09:15:00.000Z	digitalchemist	maxxist	sounds like it ... check Preferences->Advanced->View Certificates
2009-04-26T09:16:00.000Z	maxxist	digitalchemist	yeah there is none listed at all in there.  except for a bunch of corporate ones.....
2009-04-26T09:16:00.000Z	digitalchemist	maxxist	mine is listed under 'Servers' tab
2009-04-26T09:17:00.000Z	digitalchemist	maxxist	maybe try the 'Add Exception' button and put in the address for your router if there's nothing listed in the 'Servers' tab
2009-04-26T09:19:00.000Z	maxxist	digitalchemist	good idea.  same results.
2009-04-26T09:20:00.000Z	digitalchemist	maxxist	not sure where to go from there... are you using http or https?
2009-04-26T09:20:00.000Z	maxxist	digitalchemist	Firefox says "Your certificate contains the same serial number as another certificate issued by the certificate authority.  please get a new certificate containing a unique serial number.
2009-04-26T09:21:00.000Z	maxxist	digitalchemist	i am gonna ask the #firefox channel.
2009-04-26T09:21:00.000Z	maxxist	digitalchemist	thanx for the effort
2009-04-26T09:21:00.000Z	digitalchemist	maxxist	yeah, that might be more helpful -- good luck
2009-04-26T09:22:00.000Z	digitalchemist	maxxist	is this dd-wrt firmware?
2009-04-26T09:23:00.000Z	maxxist	digitalchemist	nope stock linksys
2009-04-26T09:23:00.000Z	digitalchemist	maxxist	well, not sure if it'd be the same then, but I have an entry in 'Authorities' under NewMedia-NET for mine
2009-04-26T09:26:00.000Z	maxxist	digitalchemist	hey man.  you rock.
2009-04-26T09:26:00.000Z	digitalchemist	maxxist	victory?
2009-04-26T09:27:00.000Z	maxxist	digitalchemist	hey man.  i looked through there and there was a linksys one.  i exported it to a file and then i deleted it.  now I have the option to add an exception.
