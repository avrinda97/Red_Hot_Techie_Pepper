2010-05-20T23:36:00.000Z	b0n1		bluefish
2010-05-20T23:36:00.000Z	mneptok	b0n1	ssh -X user@host
2010-05-20T23:36:00.000Z	b0n1		i did
2010-05-20T23:36:00.000Z	b0n1		not working
2010-05-20T23:36:00.000Z	b0n1		it says command not found
2010-05-20T23:36:00.000Z	mneptok	b0n1	"which bluefish"
2010-05-20T23:36:00.000Z	b0n1		but the program is installed
2010-05-20T23:36:00.000Z	b0n1		bluefish editor
2010-05-20T23:36:00.000Z	mneptok	b0n1	type that command
2010-05-20T23:36:00.000Z	b0n1		html
2010-05-20T23:37:00.000Z	b0n1		the command is usually "bluefish <file> "
2010-05-20T23:37:00.000Z	mneptok	b0n1	"which bluefish"  <---- type THAT command (no quotes)
2010-05-20T23:37:00.000Z	b0n1		oh ok xD
2010-05-20T23:38:00.000Z	b0n1		it says no bluefish in
2010-05-20T23:38:00.000Z	mneptok	b0n1	so then the app is not in your $PATH, which is why you can't just type the command name
2010-05-20T23:38:00.000Z	b0n1		but i can use my bluefish right?
2010-05-20T23:38:00.000Z	b0n1		on my pc
2010-05-20T23:39:00.000Z	b0n1		how does that work ?
2010-05-20T23:39:00.000Z	b0n1	mneptok	 you know what i mean?
