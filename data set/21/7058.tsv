2007-01-02T12:44:00.000Z	arrenlex	function1	gtk+ themes are harder.
2007-01-02T12:24:00.000Z	arrenlex	function1	Audacity < 1.3.0? wxwidgets.
2007-01-02T12:24:00.000Z	arrenlex	function1	You can skin it by using a gtk+ skin.
2007-01-02T12:24:00.000Z	arrenlex	function1	audacity >= 1.3.0 uses GTK2. You can skin it by using a GTK2 skin
2007-01-02T12:24:00.000Z	function1	arrenlex	skin audacity or skin wxwidgets?
2007-01-02T12:25:00.000Z	arrenlex	function1	Audacity -> wxwigets -> gtk+, so adding a gtk+ theme changes the look of audacity.
2007-01-02T12:26:00.000Z	function1	arrenlex	looks like i have 1.2.4b. latest version in the repos for edgy
2007-01-02T12:26:00.000Z	arrenlex	function1	Strongly advise you to get the new beta. It's purty.
2007-01-02T12:27:00.000Z	arrenlex	function1	Yes it is, and no it isn't, respectively.
2007-01-02T12:41:00.000Z	function1	arrenlex	k, how to switch gtk2 theme?
2007-01-02T12:41:00.000Z	arrenlex	function1	It's your gnome theme. Are you running gnome?
2007-01-02T12:42:00.000Z	arrenlex	function1	Do you know how to change your gnome theme?
2007-01-02T12:42:00.000Z	arrenlex	function1	There you go. :)
2007-01-02T12:43:00.000Z	function1	arrenlex	it didnt make audacity look any better though it still looks clunky and gross with non-antialiased fonts. it never matched my gnome 'human' theme
2007-01-02T12:44:00.000Z	arrenlex	function1	Are you sure you're running audacity 1.3.0beta?
2007-01-02T12:44:00.000Z	arrenlex	function1	Oh! That's different.
2007-01-02T12:45:00.000Z	arrenlex	function1	Why not just install the beta?
2007-01-02T12:47:00.000Z	function1	arrenlex	not arrenles. sorry. msg for you ^^
