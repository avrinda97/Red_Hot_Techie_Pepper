2005-09-19T07:58:00.000Z	jtan325	dabaR	"ping www.anandtech.com" seems to return nothing
2005-09-19T08:00:00.000Z	jtan325	dabaR	i don't think it's a site down issue though
2005-09-19T08:00:00.000Z	dabaR	jtan325	traceroute. its no installed by default.
2005-09-19T08:03:00.000Z	jtan325	dabaR	so something like "traceroute www.anandtech.com"?
2005-09-19T08:03:00.000Z	dabaR	jtan325	exactamant, please excuse my french.
2005-09-19T08:04:00.000Z	jtan325	dabaR	sooo what am i supposed to see?
2005-09-19T08:04:00.000Z	dabaR	jtan325	exactly what you said.
2005-09-19T08:06:00.000Z	jtan325	dabaR	http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/2174
2005-09-19T08:06:00.000Z	dabaR	jtan325	do you have a router?
2005-09-19T08:07:00.000Z	dabaR	jtan325	see the last IP it fails on? it is very similar to the one you are trying to get to, you can see that from the first line.
2005-09-19T08:08:00.000Z	dabaR	jtan325	remember this, taht is basic network troubleshooting.
2005-09-19T08:08:00.000Z	dabaR	jtan325	the traceroute, and ping. which is also the extent of what i Know:)
2005-12-03T09:10:00.000Z	dabaR	jtan325	why dont you paste your java program into paste.ubuntulinux.nl?
2005-12-03T09:11:00.000Z	jtan325	dabaR	i think the java program is legit
2005-12-03T09:11:00.000Z	dabaR	jtan325	I think roses are red.
2005-12-03T09:13:00.000Z	dabaR	jtan325	try #java, if you wont go along with my questions, and noone else answers.
2005-12-03T09:13:00.000Z	jtan325	dabaR	i would paste it, but the program is actually a project, with dozens of files
2005-12-03T09:14:00.000Z	dabaR	jtan325	then, you need to run the file including the package, so like, java org.MainMethodClass
