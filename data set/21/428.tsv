2012-01-03T05:27:00.000Z	diverdude		i am trying to install packages for ubuntu apache2 for a long time now but i get this error: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/500305249 it is very frstrating...what am I missing?
2012-01-03T05:28:00.000Z	Kiten	diverdude	try sudo apt-get check
2012-01-03T05:29:00.000Z	diverdude	Kiten	it did not help
2012-01-03T05:29:00.000Z	diverdude	Kiten	also not
2012-01-03T05:30:00.000Z	Kiten	diverdude	apt-get update was to make sure your cache was up to date
2012-01-03T05:34:00.000Z	diverdude	Kiten	but if there is some problem will -f (force) it not potentially make it much worse?
2012-01-03T05:34:00.000Z	Kiten	diverdude	no -f is fix
2012-01-03T05:34:00.000Z	Kiten	diverdude	apt-get --help shows all the possible flags
2012-01-03T05:35:00.000Z	diverdude	Kiten	i still get the error
2012-01-03T05:35:00.000Z	Kiten	diverdude	did you add any other sources ?
2012-01-03T05:36:00.000Z	diverdude	Kiten	yeah but for other things...long time ago
2012-01-03T05:36:00.000Z	Kiten	diverdude	do what rypervenche said
2012-01-03T05:37:00.000Z	Kiten	diverdude	then sudo apt-get purge apache2
2012-01-03T05:38:00.000Z	diverdude	Kiten	here is my output: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1037697207
2012-01-03T05:38:00.000Z	diverdude	Kiten	what does the purge do
2012-01-03T05:38:00.000Z	Kiten	diverdude	your sources list is fine
2012-01-03T05:39:00.000Z	Kiten	diverdude	it removes anything related to apache2(specifically whatever you've installed thats been tagged as apache2)
2012-01-03T05:39:00.000Z	diverdude	Kiten	but wont ii be needing that?
2012-01-03T05:39:00.000Z	Kiten	diverdude	you can reinstall them
2012-01-03T05:40:00.000Z	diverdude	Kiten	what about all my config files then and all that
2012-01-03T05:40:00.000Z	Kiten	diverdude	back them up to another directory
