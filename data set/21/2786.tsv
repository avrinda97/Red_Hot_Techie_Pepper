2010-01-05T04:24:00.000Z	ctmjr	LinuX2half	/nick new nickamne
2010-01-05T04:24:00.000Z	LinuX2half	ctmjr	I want to change my computer's user name but my IRC account
2010-01-05T04:31:00.000Z	ctmjr	LinuX2half	how did you delete the account?
2010-01-05T04:31:00.000Z	LinuX2half	ctmjr	I went to user and groups
2010-01-05T04:33:00.000Z	ctmjr	LinuX2half	use userdel try man userdel for options
2010-01-05T04:37:00.000Z	LinuX2half	ctmjr	the account is already deleted but remnants of it still remains
2010-01-05T04:42:00.000Z	ctmjr	LinuX2half	if there is still evidence of the old user try sudo userdel -r "user name" any files left you will have to manually delete make sure the user is logged out
2010-01-05T04:44:00.000Z	LinuX2half	ctmjr	well the userdel still can't seem to find the deleted account but the nickname still remains in the bash title
2010-01-05T04:47:00.000Z	ctmjr	LinuX2half	what does the command w say? and have you logged out and back in since deleting the user
2010-01-05T04:50:00.000Z	LinuX2half	ctmjr	http://www.ubuntu.pastebin.com/m251208da. Yes I have
2010-01-05T04:52:00.000Z	ctmjr	LinuX2half	is ubuntu20 the old user or new?
2010-01-05T04:53:00.000Z	LinuX2half	ctmjr	ubuntu2009(current) unbuntu2009(deleted)
2010-01-05T04:57:00.000Z	ctmjr	LinuX2half	ubuntu2009@unbuntu2009-laptop:~$ the first name is the user the second is the host or computer name try cat /etc/hostname
2010-01-05T04:58:00.000Z	LinuX2half	ctmjr	yes the hostname is the old one
2010-01-05T04:59:00.000Z	LinuX2half	ctmjr	no the exact name as to the old one; unbuntu2009
2010-01-05T05:00:00.000Z	LinuX2half	ctmjr	the hostname contains the deleted nickname but then I was going to change current nickname ubuntu2009.
2010-01-05T05:01:00.000Z	LinuX2half	ctmjr	so basically all I want to do is to change my current nickname
2010-01-05T05:01:00.000Z	LinuX2half	ctmjr	yes
2010-01-05T05:03:00.000Z	ctmjr	LinuX2half	what username do you want?
2010-01-05T05:03:00.000Z	LinuX2half	ctmjr	just ubuntu
