2009-11-28T00:05:00.000Z	usser_		anybody knows about dhcpd setup?
2009-11-28T00:07:00.000Z	usser_		right so my problem is i setup a dhcp server with range 192.168.1.100 to 192.168.1.199 initially, later on i changed the range to 192.168.1.2 to 192.168.1.199 but the dhcp server still gives out ips starting 192.168.1.100
2009-11-28T00:08:00.000Z	greezmunkey	usser_	what are you runnung the dhcp server on, ubuntu?
2009-11-28T00:09:00.000Z	usser_	greezmunkey	its a 64 bit karmic server
2009-11-28T00:09:00.000Z	greezmunkey	usser_	did you restart dhcpd?
2009-11-28T00:09:00.000Z	usser_	greezmunkey	yep, even restarted the server itself a number of times
2009-11-28T00:10:00.000Z	usser_	greezmunkey	see i dont have that many machines to test out what will happen if it runs out of leases from 100-199 range.
2009-11-28T00:10:00.000Z	greezmunkey	usser_	did you flush your leases, I assume you tested from a pc that already got an address from dhcpd...
2009-11-28T00:10:00.000Z	usser_	greezmunkey	flush the leases on a client?
2009-11-28T00:11:00.000Z	greezmunkey	usser_	that lease is MAC based, the MAC is stored, and dhcpd will continue to hand out the same IP unless the lease is gone!
2009-11-28T00:11:00.000Z	usser_	greezmunkey	aah. i see. is it on the client or the server though?
2009-11-28T00:11:00.000Z	greezmunkey	usser_	no the leases are tracked by dhcpd!
2009-11-28T00:12:00.000Z	usser_	greezmunkey	is that it /var/lib/dhcp/dhcpd.leases?
2009-11-28T00:12:00.000Z	greezmunkey	usser_	probably
2009-11-28T00:12:00.000Z	usser_	greezmunkey	yep i think it is. is it safe to just delete that file?
2009-11-28T00:13:00.000Z	greezmunkey	usser_	I wouldn't, man dhcpd to see if there is a command that you can use to flush the leases first.
2009-11-28T00:13:00.000Z	usser_	greezmunkey	got it. Thanks a lot!
2009-11-28T00:14:00.000Z	greezmunkey	usser_	np :)
2009-11-28T00:14:00.000Z	usser_	greezmunkey	i just deleted the file, and put an empty one in its place, worked like a charm. thank you
2009-11-28T00:15:00.000Z	greezmunkey	usser_	while you ar "doinking" around with dhcpd, check into setting reservations, they are a good thing...
2009-11-28T00:17:00.000Z	greezmunkey	usser_	most of the time you could probably get away with that, but unless you know that a service only write info in one place, I'd be checking the man pages before you "pull the rug out from under" one in the future.
