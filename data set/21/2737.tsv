2009-08-01T15:39:00.000Z	Saruji		hey guys, question, how do I exit the X server?  I did the ctrl-alt-backspace but it only brought to the log in part
2009-08-01T15:39:00.000Z	richardcavell	Saruji	you mean you want to go to a command line?
2009-08-01T15:39:00.000Z	Saruji	richardcavell	yes I want to install nvidia drivers
2009-08-01T15:39:00.000Z	richardcavell	Saruji	you can do that without going to a command line
2009-08-01T15:39:00.000Z	richardcavell	Saruji	but for the record sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
2009-08-01T15:41:00.000Z	Saruji	richardcavell	ok thank you, do you recommend not being in the terminal?  allquixotic cool makes sense, so shut down or best just stay on desktop and run the sh command here?
2009-08-01T15:41:00.000Z	richardcavell	Saruji	install your drivers without doing anything special
2009-08-01T15:41:00.000Z	richardcavell	Saruji	just install them from within a Terminal or however youlike
2009-08-01T15:42:00.000Z	Saruji	richardcavell	good advice thx allquixotic right thats the problem i am running into
2009-08-01T15:48:00.000Z	Saruji	richardcavell	ok hey i'm back, problem, whenever I try to install the drivers via terminal within x server i get an error message that says nvidia drivers cannot install while x is running, so I tried the sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop, all that happened was the screen shut off with a blinking curser I couldnt type with...so how can I install from within x? or without, whichever..
2009-08-01T15:50:00.000Z	richardcavell	Saruji	do you know how to select recovery mode on your boot menu?
2009-08-01T15:50:00.000Z	richardcavell	Saruji	boot to a root shell
2009-08-01T15:50:00.000Z	Saruji	richardcavell	yes
2009-08-01T15:51:00.000Z	Saruji	richardcavell	see thats where you loose me
2009-08-01T15:51:00.000Z	Saruji	richardcavell	shell?
2009-08-01T15:51:00.000Z	richardcavell	Saruji	select (recovery mode) from your kernel boot options.  Do you know how to do that?
2009-08-01T15:51:00.000Z	richardcavell	Saruji	then it will give you some options.  Select root shell
2009-08-01T15:52:00.000Z	Saruji	richardcavell	you mean when my comp first loads i have a choice of options of which partition or system to run?
2009-08-01T15:54:00.000Z	richardcavell	Saruji	Look at this.  Do you recognize a screen that looks something like this: http://www.pcmech.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/df8btqd3-64dndsgmd3.png
2009-08-01T15:55:00.000Z	Saruji	richardcavell	right thats the one, ok sorry to trouble you with this, thank YOU so much, will be back later :)
2009-08-01T15:55:00.000Z	richardcavell	Saruji	no problem Saruji.  Select (recovery mode) and then select root shell
