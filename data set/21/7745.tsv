2009-05-21T23:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dupondje	no since Adobe Flash plugin is  closed source
2009-05-21T23:42:00.000Z	dupondje	sebsebseb	crap :( cause It was working once, but still not :(
2009-05-21T23:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dupondje	you an try Gnahs and Swfdec as Flash alternatives :)
2009-05-21T23:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dupondje	Gnash
2009-05-21T23:44:00.000Z	dupondje	sebsebseb	but its weird, it worked once on ubuntu, but since I reinstalled its broken
2009-05-21T23:53:00.000Z	dupondje	sebsebseb	 gnash doesn't display anything :(
2009-05-21T23:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dupondje	they aren't as good as Adobe Flash, but  they are alright these days
2010-04-30T01:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dupondje	uh well see above ^
2010-04-30T01:32:00.000Z	dupondje	sebsebseb	lagg :( :P
2010-04-30T01:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dupondje	have the final sure, but  maybe not with all the updates installed properly
2010-04-30T01:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dupondje	  bencc  let's be clear, you have the updates sure, but they may not be giving you the features you are meant to have
2010-04-30T01:34:00.000Z	dupondje	sebsebseb	oops :) karmic from alpha 2, and lucid since alpha 1 :) seems like I should do a reinstall ?
2010-04-30T01:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dupondje	if your lacking features that  your meant to have,  if not, your probably ok,  but well  10.04 has a nice installer slide show as well
2010-04-30T01:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dupondje	oh and that's something if you been upgrading Karmic since alpha 1, without things messing up  big time
2010-04-30T01:35:00.000Z	dupondje	sebsebseb	think all have them all :) but never seen slideshow installer ... héhé :D
2010-04-30T01:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dupondje	yeah that's for clean installs of  9.10 and 10.04, slide show installers
2010-04-30T01:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dupondje	like Windows so people can find out about the operating system, whilst it's installing
2010-04-30T01:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dupondje	possibily, since Sunbird no longer support Desktop Linux, however there's a fork of Sunbird, which does
2010-04-30T01:39:00.000Z	dupondje	sebsebseb	whats the fork .
2010-04-30T01:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dupondje	nightinggal or something.  search http://www.linuxtoday.com for Sunbird, and stuff will come up about that
