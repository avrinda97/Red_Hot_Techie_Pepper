2010-05-18T16:28:00.000Z	blue_anna	masterkorp	both on and off it doesn't work? then you have the wrong keyboard profile. go to preferences->keyboards and try to manually add your keyboard on the second tab
2010-05-18T16:28:00.000Z	masterkorp		i funs as always off
2010-05-18T16:29:00.000Z	masterkorp		*funcs

2010-05-18T16:30:00.000Z	masterkorp		any suggestion?
2010-05-18T16:31:00.000Z	blue_anna	masterkorp	I'd do two things if I were you -- I'd search for your keyboard + ubuntu or + linux or whatever and see if you can find something useful, and I'd try a different keyboard profile, despite the fact that you think you have the correct profile for your keyboard
