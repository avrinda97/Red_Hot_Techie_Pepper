2006-03-19T07:52:00.000Z	Andr31		Does anybody know why don`t my mp3`s play, and I installed gstreamer.
2006-03-19T07:53:00.000Z	Andr31		I INSTALLED GSTREAMER _jason
2006-03-19T07:53:00.000Z	_jason	Andr31	I wasn't sure if you were referring to gstreamer0.8-mad
2006-03-19T07:53:00.000Z	_jason	Andr31	gst-register-0.8 and restart totem
2006-03-19T07:54:00.000Z	Andr31	_jason	you mean download it?
2006-03-19T07:54:00.000Z	_jason	Andr31	run the command 'gst-register-0.8'
2006-03-19T07:55:00.000Z	Andr31	_jason	 still not... :/
2006-03-19T07:55:00.000Z	_jason	Andr31	if one mp3 plays then you can play mp3's
2006-03-19T07:56:00.000Z	_jason	Andr31	'totem'
2006-03-19T07:59:00.000Z	Andr31	_jason	I managed to play that mp3 with RythmBox
2006-03-19T08:00:00.000Z	_jason	Andr31	so you can only play one mp3 out of your whole collection?  what happens with the other ones?
2006-03-19T08:00:00.000Z	Andr31	_jason	 they simply don`t load
2006-03-19T08:00:00.000Z	_jason	Andr31	you are using breezy?
2006-03-19T08:02:00.000Z	_jason	Andr31	yeah
2006-03-19T08:02:00.000Z	_jason	Andr31	I don't know, I can't understand how one can play.  I would think it would be all or nothing
2006-03-19T08:03:00.000Z	Andr31	_jason	me too
2006-03-19T08:03:00.000Z	Andr31	_jason	do I need sudo <something>
2006-03-19T08:04:00.000Z	_jason	Andr31	shouldn't, that gstreamer0.8-mad package is all you need to play mp3's
2006-03-19T08:06:00.000Z	Andr31	_jason	 can you reccomend me a command line mp3 player?
2006-03-19T08:06:00.000Z	_jason	Andr31	mpg123
2006-03-19T08:09:00.000Z	_jason	Andr31	vlc is in universe
