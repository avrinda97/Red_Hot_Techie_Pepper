2006-01-13T11:16:00.000Z	Contamination		Anyone think they can help me with a 5.10 install on a iMac?
2006-01-13T11:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Contamination	 :P what part do you need help with?
2006-01-13T11:16:00.000Z	Contamination	Dr_Willis	X says it all
2006-01-13T11:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Contamination	 Huh? :P
2006-01-13T11:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Contamination	 odd.. what your specs on the imac?
2006-01-13T11:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Contamination	 I got an iMAC DV - with  like 256mb. and it ran 'ok' on mine..  not sure what the cpu is.. (500mhz i think)
2006-01-13T11:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Contamination	 may want to check the ubuntu wiki/forums - there maybe a mac support section.
2006-01-13T11:20:00.000Z	Contamination	Dr_Willis	I did and they all could not find the solution :)
2006-01-13T11:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Contamination	 heh - do like I did.. put osx back on (or os9) and use it  for a SSH box. :P
2006-01-13T11:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Contamination	 i had other 'issues' with ubuntu on my imacDv
2006-01-13T11:22:00.000Z	Contamination	Dr_Willis	So basically you know nothing about the problems with X on the iMac for the 5.10 dist?
2006-01-13T11:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Contamination	 I had no issues with it.
2006-01-13T11:23:00.000Z	Contamination	Dr_Willis	what dist is installed on that iMac?
2006-01-13T11:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Contamination	 the issues i had was with a off set on the Monitor.
2006-01-13T11:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Contamination	 i think it was 5.10 i had on it a few mo ago.. Its back to OSx now.
2006-01-13T11:24:00.000Z	Contamination	Dr_Willis	Alright and how did you correct this off set on the monitor?
2006-01-13T11:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Contamination	 I dident.. it was a real PAIN.. aparently the 'fix' was to boot to OS-X and use its tools to adjust the monitor.. well i had no dualbooting. so i couldent fix it from within linuix
2006-01-13T11:25:00.000Z	Contamination	Dr_Willis	Alright thanks anyway
2006-01-13T11:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Contamination	 yea over all - i was not impressed much with it on the imac.. but my imac is a old box now a days.
2006-01-13T11:26:00.000Z	Contamination	Dr_Willis	Yes it is but I prefer to bring back some life into it by running ubuntu.
2006-01-13T11:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Contamination	 yea.  I got several linxu box's so i jsut got the imac in the corner and use it as a ssh to the linux box machine. (or vnc)
