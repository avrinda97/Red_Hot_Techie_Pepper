2011-12-13T17:50:00.000Z	illy		i've just had a horrendous time trying to get my new and shiny Ubuntu 11.10 to connect on a static ip setup using NetworkManager
2011-12-13T17:50:00.000Z	illy		any advice on making this simple?
2011-12-13T17:50:00.000Z	paulsomebody	illy	What is your connection type?
2011-12-13T17:51:00.000Z	paulsomebody	illy	Is it PPTP, or something else?
2011-12-13T17:52:00.000Z	illy	paulsomebody	sorry - you've already gone past my skillset
2011-12-13T17:52:00.000Z	paulsomebody	illy	Like, do you have a router that dispenses the internet for you, or do you just have a cable that goes to your computer?
2011-12-13T17:53:00.000Z	paulsomebody	illy	Okay, so what do you want to make simple? Entering parameters?
2011-12-13T17:53:00.000Z	paulsomebody	illy	Like, user name and password?
2011-12-13T17:55:00.000Z	paulsomebody	illy	Sorry, I have never done it via command line.
2011-12-13T17:55:00.000Z	paulsomebody	illy	But what precisely do you mean under «everything I have«?
2011-12-13T17:56:00.000Z	illy	paulsomebody	ip address, subnet, gateway
2011-12-13T17:58:00.000Z	paulsomebody	illy	Ok.
2011-12-13T17:58:00.000Z	paulsomebody	illy	It is fairly easy to do via Network Manager.
2011-12-13T17:59:00.000Z	paulsomebody	illy	Just click on the applet, see the «Wired» tab.
2011-12-13T17:59:00.000Z	paulsomebody	illy	I meant, click the applet, go for the «Edit Connections» line.
2011-12-13T17:59:00.000Z	paulsomebody	illy	Then «Wired».
2011-12-13T18:01:00.000Z	paulsomebody	illy	I have not encountered that issue. Does simply pressing the «Add» button and entering the details under the IPv4 tab work?
2011-12-13T18:02:00.000Z	illy	paulsomebody	it stores it as a connection, but when you click on Connection Information it pops up with "Error displaying connection information:
2011-12-13T18:04:00.000Z	paulsomebody	illy	That is not nice. I have not encountered that issue personally, but you might want to look for solutions here. http://askubuntu.com/search?q=wired+network+device+not+managed
2011-12-13T18:06:00.000Z	illy	paulsomebody	thanks - at least i'm not alone:)
2011-12-13T18:08:00.000Z	paulsomebody	illy	This is a pleasant thing to know. :) Feel free to post there again if you don't find solution in one of the threads.
