2008-03-17T12:38:00.000Z	michael__		Could someone help me out?  All the icons in OpenOffice have been replaced by text
2008-03-17T12:39:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	michael__	That happens if you uninstall the human theme for openoffice. Confirm that you still have it installed.
2008-03-17T12:39:00.000Z	michael__	ArthurArchnix	 how do I do that?
2008-03-17T12:41:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	michael__	Copy and paste this in a terminal:    sudo aptitude show openoffice.org-style-human  | grep State
2008-03-17T12:43:00.000Z	michael__	ArthurArchnix	 The terminal says "Status:  installed"
2008-03-17T12:43:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	michael__	Ok... well, maybe something simpler then. Open up openoffice.
2008-03-17T12:43:00.000Z	michael__	ArthurArchnix	 Alright
2008-03-17T12:44:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	michael__	then go >tools >options >view and make sure that under Menu there is a checkmark in the box that says show icons
2008-03-17T12:46:00.000Z	michael__	ArthurArchnix	 You mean, the box labelled "Show Icons in Menus" is checked?  I don't see any other "Show Icons" box?
2008-03-17T12:47:00.000Z	michael__	ArthurArchnix	 Yes, it's checked
2008-03-17T12:47:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	michael__	ok, then this is probably the ubuntu bug about openoffice...
2008-03-17T12:47:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	michael__	 it's just about making sure you have the right theme installed I think...  try this...
2008-03-17T12:47:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	michael__	what's the output of this: sudo aptitude show human-theme human-icon-theme | grep State
2008-03-17T12:50:00.000Z	michael__	ArthurArchnix	 It says everything's installed
2008-03-17T12:51:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	michael__	Sorry. That was my best guess. At least, that's what the problem was when I had problems. Remember where you were when you checked for the icons in menu? Try changing those icons to something else. There's default. Human. Chrystal. Try changing it then restarting writer. Failing that, all I can think is to try reinstalling office.
2008-03-17T12:53:00.000Z	michael__	ArthurArchnix	 Tried and failed.  I'll try reinstalling Office after I'm done using it.  Thanks for the help!
2008-03-17T12:54:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	michael__	wait
2008-03-17T12:54:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	michael__	what might be easier, at least, if you're going to reinstall, is to try this first.
2008-03-17T12:54:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	michael__	sudo aptitude install openoffice.org-style-*
2008-03-17T12:58:00.000Z	michael__	ArthurArchnix	 I installed the tango theme through that way and everything works now!  Thank you!
2008-03-17T12:58:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	michael__	cheers
