2005-02-09T06:04:00.000Z	cafuego	Stereotype	Runs mainly okay at the moment.
2005-02-09T06:05:00.000Z	Stereotype	cafuego	I was under the impression Hoary was only test phase and live CD. Not officially released.
2005-02-09T06:06:00.000Z	cafuego	Stereotype	it's on the official servers, makes it official to me ;-)
2005-02-09T06:06:00.000Z	cafuego	Stereotype	The only problem i have with it is Evolution not working (at all) but that seems to be aHoary problem, not an amd64 problem.
2005-02-09T06:07:00.000Z	Stereotype	cafuego	Link me?
2005-02-09T06:08:00.000Z	cafuego	Stereotype	http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/hoary/http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/hoary/Contents-amd64.gz
2005-02-09T06:08:00.000Z	cafuego	Stereotype	Just fetch a warty cd and update after install.
2005-02-09T06:09:00.000Z	cafuego	Stereotype	I did a slightly odd install; went from Debian Sid/AMD64 (via Alioth) directly to Hoary.
2005-02-09T06:10:00.000Z	cafuego	Stereotype	yeah, just install that, then edit sources.list and doa  dist-upgrade.
2005-02-09T06:12:00.000Z	cafuego	Stereotype	official. Just not reelase.
2005-02-09T06:13:00.000Z	cafuego	Stereotype	No. not your definition of official. The normal definition of official does apply though.
2005-02-09T06:14:00.000Z	cafuego	Stereotype	You should be using Debian woody then.
2005-02-09T06:18:00.000Z	cafuego	Stereotype	As long as you dist-upgrade, yes.
