2007-06-25T13:59:00.000Z	alecw1		How do I uninstall Windows applications from Wine? I installed Fireworks 8, and I want to remove it, but I can't seem to do it.
2007-06-25T13:59:00.000Z	jrib	alecw1	try #winehq if no one here knows
2007-08-06T09:04:00.000Z	jrib	alecw1	pitivi, kino
2007-08-06T11:12:00.000Z	jrib	alecw1	you just want to start the screensaver and lock it?
2007-08-06T11:12:00.000Z	alecw1	jrib	either, one.
2007-08-06T11:13:00.000Z	jrib	alecw1	set DISPLAY and use gnome-screensaver-command with the lock switch probably
2007-08-06T11:14:00.000Z	alecw1	jrib	the DiSPLAY?
2007-08-06T11:14:00.000Z	jrib	alecw1	export DISPLAY=whatever
2007-08-06T11:15:00.000Z	jrib	alecw1	if you do 'echo $DISPLAY' in an x session you'll see what it currently is for that screen
2007-08-06T11:16:00.000Z	jrib	alecw1	k, you need to find out what screen you want to lock, then 'export DISPLAY=whatever' when you find that out, then 'gnome-screensaver-command --whatever-the-switch-to-lock-the-screen-is'
2007-08-06T11:16:00.000Z	alecw1	jrib	can I PM you?
2007-08-06T11:16:00.000Z	jrib	alecw1	you can use #ubuntu-classroom if there is too much traffic here
2008-01-13T04:51:00.000Z	jrib	alecw1	do you like LaTeX?
2008-01-13T04:52:00.000Z	alecw1	jrib	no, what exactly does it do?
2008-01-13T04:52:00.000Z	jrib	alecw1	it's like html for text.  There is a a class that I believe is called "beamer" that I've seen some people use for presentations
2008-01-13T04:53:00.000Z	alecw1	jrib	I don't know, it looks a little complicated (google). I'm looking for a simple thing.
2008-01-13T04:54:00.000Z	jrib	alecw1	I agree, it would only be helpful if you already new about and liked LaTeX
2008-01-13T04:54:00.000Z	jrib	alecw1	there is always google presentations
2008-01-13T04:54:00.000Z	alecw1	jrib	Google has a presentation web application?
2008-01-13T04:55:00.000Z	jrib	alecw1	yes, docs.google.com
2008-01-13T04:55:00.000Z	alecw1	jrib	thanks!
