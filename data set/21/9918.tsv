2005-06-18T15:24:00.000Z	nalioth	zerokills	what is the trouble? its purty simple
2005-06-18T15:25:00.000Z	zerokills	nalioth	we made a ethernet cable to run to my brother's system from the router. but we're getting no connection
2005-06-18T15:25:00.000Z	nalioth	zerokills	did you test for continuity?
2005-06-18T15:26:00.000Z	zerokills	nalioth	how do we do that?
2005-06-18T15:26:00.000Z	nalioth	zerokills	with a multimeter
2005-06-18T15:26:00.000Z	zerokills	nalioth	nope, is that what we should do?
2005-06-18T15:27:00.000Z	nalioth	zerokills	yes, when you manufacture something, it should be tested b4 use
2005-06-18T15:29:00.000Z	zerokills	nalioth	can you tell me some basics about setting up the wires in an ethernet cable?
2005-06-18T15:29:00.000Z	zerokills	nalioth	for instance are the wires supposed to be in a certain ordeR?
2005-06-18T15:31:00.000Z	nalioth	zerokills	each terminator has 8 sockets i believe, wire a should go from socket 1 on one end to socket 1 on the other end
2005-06-18T15:31:00.000Z	nalioth	zerokills	and on and on
