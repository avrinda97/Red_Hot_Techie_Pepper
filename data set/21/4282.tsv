2009-05-20T08:49:00.000Z	metalpres		so i am trying to setup a samba share,  using the ip address of the other machine I can connect fine, but when trying to use the computer name its coming back that its unreachable,  is there something else that needs to be done to use the name instead of ip?  i thought it was just //computername  instead of //192.168.xxx.xxx
2009-05-20T08:49:00.000Z	raylu	metalpres	run the command: host computername
2009-05-20T08:50:00.000Z	metalpres	raylu	when i do the host command it comes back showing 2 ips for the machine
2009-05-20T08:50:00.000Z	metalpres	raylu	neither are the IPs are the 192.168.xxx.xxx one i normally use though
2009-05-20T08:50:00.000Z	raylu	metalpres	well, there's your problem :D
2009-05-20T08:51:00.000Z	raylu	metalpres	before it gave you the ip, it should give you a dns provider. is that correct?
2009-05-20T08:52:00.000Z	metalpres	raylu	it didnt give me any dns info, just 2 ips and then timed out
2009-05-20T08:52:00.000Z	raylu	metalpres	oops, sorry. use: nslookup computername
2009-05-20T08:54:00.000Z	metalpres	raylu	ok that time it gave me the dns server ip
2009-05-20T08:54:00.000Z	raylu	metalpres	is that the correct server?
2009-05-20T08:55:00.000Z	metalpres	raylu	its the ip of my router, not the machine i want to connect to
2009-05-20T08:56:00.000Z	raylu	metalpres	generally, your router is also your dns server, so that's fine
2009-05-20T08:56:00.000Z	metalpres	raylu	yea
2009-05-20T08:56:00.000Z	raylu	metalpres	in which case, you need to convince your router that computername is something else
2009-05-20T08:57:00.000Z	metalpres	raylu	im not sure what you mean
2009-05-20T08:57:00.000Z	raylu	metalpres	i mean you need to configure your router
2009-05-20T08:59:00.000Z	metalpres	raylu	in my routers settings it already shows my other machine listed and it recognizes the machines name correctly
2009-05-20T08:59:00.000Z	metalpres	raylu	just when i try to connect to that machine using its name from this machine it doesnt respond
2009-05-20T09:00:00.000Z	raylu	metalpres	then i'm not sure. the problem is most likelywith your router, though
2009-05-20T09:02:00.000Z	metalpres	raylu	ok well thanks anyway, i guess i'll just use my backup plan and set the ips on each machine to be static so i dont have to even worry about using the machine names
2009-05-20T09:02:00.000Z	raylu	metalpres	as a hack, you could edit /etc/hosts
