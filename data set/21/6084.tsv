2009-08-05T00:58:00.000Z	bastidrazor	Cyrus25801	pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list
2009-08-05T01:01:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	bastidrazor	http://pastebin.com/m1ae55608
2009-08-05T01:02:00.000Z	bastidrazor	Cyrus25801	you're file looks fine, what programs/applications are you looking for that isn't being found?
2009-08-05T01:02:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	bastidrazor	vlc; flash, opera etc
2009-08-05T01:05:00.000Z	bastidrazor	Cyrus25801	in a terminal type sudo apt-get install vlc  .. what does it give?
2009-08-05T01:05:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	bastidrazor	that is how i installed vlc
2009-08-05T01:06:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	bastidrazor	that works
2009-08-05T01:06:00.000Z	bastidrazor	Cyrus25801	possibly click the reload button in synaptic?
2009-08-05T01:07:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	bastidrazor	i have reloaded, and i have said sudo apt-get update as well
2009-08-05T01:07:00.000Z	bastidrazor	Cyrus25801	synaptic, apt-get, aptitude all read from the same sources list so why you're not seeing it in synaptic is unknown to me
2009-08-05T01:09:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	bastidrazor	well the main problem i am having is that i can't see a flash chat window i am trying to load.so i wanted to see what flash i installed
2009-08-05T01:10:00.000Z	bastidrazor	Cyrus25801	in firefox you could type about:plugins in the address bar and it will tell you what firefox is using
2009-08-05T01:13:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	bastidrazor	the following is installed: application/x-shockwave-flash Adobe Flash movie swf    application/futuresplash FutureSplash movie
2009-08-05T01:13:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	bastidrazor	any idea why the flash page loads bt show nothing
2009-08-05T01:14:00.000Z	bastidrazor	Cyrus25801	not really if other flash pages work for you. some sites require IE only browsers. i've run into that in the past
2009-08-05T01:15:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	bastidrazor	maybe it is the IE thing
2009-08-05T01:16:00.000Z	bastidrazor	Cyrus25801	that is a possibility. Firefox has a user agent switcher that can fool most sites.
2009-08-05T01:16:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	bastidrazor	how do i get that
2009-08-05T01:17:00.000Z	bastidrazor	Cyrus25801	add-ons for firefox search for user agent switcher
2009-08-05T01:19:00.000Z	Cyrus25801	bastidrazor	thnx will try that
