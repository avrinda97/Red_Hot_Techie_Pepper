2008-08-29T01:55:00.000Z	cernex		Escuse me, but how do I activate a USB headset?
2008-08-29T01:55:00.000Z	cernex		It is plugged and all, but it's not giving any sound
2008-08-29T01:56:00.000Z	Gnea	cernex	should be able to use volume control to switch to it
2008-08-29T01:56:00.000Z	Gnea	cernex	double-click on the volume icon
2008-08-29T01:59:00.000Z	cernex	Gnea	ok, I'm on the volume control
2008-08-29T01:59:00.000Z	Gnea	cernex	File->Change Device
2008-08-29T02:00:00.000Z	cernex	Gnea	and after that, should I restart?
2008-08-29T02:00:00.000Z	Gnea	cernex	no need.
2008-08-29T02:00:00.000Z	Gnea	cernex	just select the device and make sure the USB Headphones are not muted
2008-08-29T02:01:00.000Z	Gnea	cernex	do you want all sound output to go to the headphones?
2008-08-29T02:01:00.000Z	cernex	Gnea	sure
2008-08-29T02:02:00.000Z	Gnea	cernex	then you'll need to System->Preferences->Sound and tell it what device to use for various playback methods :)
2008-08-29T02:05:00.000Z	cernex	Gnea	weird, it still isn't playing
2008-08-29T02:06:00.000Z	cernex	Gnea	my headset has one of those lights to show if it's plugged or not
2008-08-29T02:06:00.000Z	cernex	Gnea	and the light is lit, so it IS plugged
2008-08-29T02:06:00.000Z	cernex	Gnea	but it isn't giving any sound, :(
2008-08-29T02:07:00.000Z	Gnea	cernex	hrm, try rebooting it now
2008-08-29T02:20:00.000Z	cernex	Gnea	Nope, still not working
2008-08-29T02:20:00.000Z	cernex	Gnea	Funny thing is, I plugged my old speakers back
2008-08-29T02:20:00.000Z	cernex	Gnea	(they don't work, BTW)
2008-08-29T02:20:00.000Z	cernex	Gnea	and even with the whole "headset" configuration, they still play sound
