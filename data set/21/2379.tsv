2009-11-15T17:56:00.000Z	ace	kyentei	USB keyboard and mouse.. Now can you help?
2009-11-15T17:57:00.000Z	ace	kyentei	do you have an answer or were you just curious?
2009-11-15T18:00:00.000Z	ace	kyentei	do you have an answer or were you just curious?
2009-11-15T18:01:00.000Z	kyentei	ace	Probably just curious. If only USB works, I'm wondering wether these usb-ports are on your mainboard or on a PCI card.
2009-11-15T18:02:00.000Z	ace	kyentei	I'm not sure.. Everything worked great with 9.04 I did a complete reinstall with 9.10 and been having problems. I've been trying to fix it for 2 days now
2009-11-15T18:02:00.000Z	kyentei	ace	Have you tried installing 9.04 and then upgrading to 9.10?
2009-11-15T18:03:00.000Z	ace	kyentei	I can't get 9.04 to install
2009-11-15T18:03:00.000Z	kyentei	ace	Then how did you install it previously?
2009-11-15T18:04:00.000Z	ace	kyentei	I mean after installing 9.10 I can't get 9.04 to install again. It hangs up even if I try to run live cd
2009-11-15T18:05:00.000Z	kyentei	ace	That's really odd. If your mouse and keyboard worked fine during the 9.10 installation, something might have gone wrong with your hardware.
2009-11-15T18:05:00.000Z	kyentei	ace	Try using a live-usb. Wondering how that turns out.
2009-11-15T18:06:00.000Z	ace	kyentei	they actually didn't work when it came to the screen to put in my info. I had to restart with USB keyboard and mouse. I was hoping it would work once installed
2009-11-15T18:06:00.000Z	ace	kyentei	what is live-usb?
2009-11-15T18:07:00.000Z	kyentei	ace	If you happen to have the 9.10 iso and a USB stick (I'd recommend at least 2GB of storage) go to system>Administration>USB Startup Disk Creator
2009-11-15T18:08:00.000Z	ace	kyentei	thanks, I'll give that a shot
2009-11-15T18:09:00.000Z	kyentei	ace	Have you tried using google to see if there are any other people dealing with the same issue and have the same motherboard? It's really odd that a 9.04 CD won't work after installing 9.10. And even more odd that usb works, but the old ports for keyboards and mice don't
2009-11-15T18:09:00.000Z	ace	kyentei	yes, I've been searching for 2 days now with no luck
2009-11-15T18:10:00.000Z	kyentei	ace	Alright. This is about as far as I can assist you from here. Goodluck on the usb-stick creation. If this doesn't work out, you might want to try the ubuntu forums.
2009-11-15T18:10:00.000Z	ace	kyentei	Thank you for your help. Very much appreciated!
2009-11-15T18:11:00.000Z	kyentei	ace	:-)
