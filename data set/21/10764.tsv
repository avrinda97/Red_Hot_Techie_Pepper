2004-11-17T08:12:00.000Z	jmichel		hi
2004-11-17T08:12:00.000Z	jmichel		I would like to know if the following bug has already been reported
2004-11-17T08:13:00.000Z	jmichel		I installed ubuntu using my old debian sid partitions
2004-11-17T08:13:00.000Z	jmichel		and the installer did not activate my swap
2004-11-17T08:13:00.000Z	jmichel		so every time my ram was full
2004-11-17T08:13:00.000Z	jmichel		the computer was freezing
2004-11-17T08:13:00.000Z	jmichel		do I need to report this bug ?
2004-11-17T08:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jmichel	put a line in /etc/fstab something like this one:
2004-11-17T08:15:00.000Z	jmichel	thoreauputic	I know thx
2004-11-17T08:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jmichel	/dev/hda7  none  swap  sw  0  0  (not hda7 on yours, necessarily)
2004-11-17T08:15:00.000Z	jmichel		I know
2004-11-17T08:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jmichel	OK - just in case :)
2004-11-17T08:16:00.000Z	jmichel		but it took me a while to figure out what was going wrong
2004-11-17T08:16:00.000Z	jmichel		I'm not here to ask how to fix it, but to ask if I need to report it
2004-11-17T08:16:00.000Z	jmichel		but thanks
2004-11-17T08:17:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jmichel	I've had similar things happen installing other distros - I doubt it's ubuntu specific
2004-11-17T08:17:00.000Z	jmichel		ok
2004-11-17T08:18:00.000Z	jmichel	thoreauputic	ok ;o) but I think the installer should handle it, no ?
2004-11-17T08:19:00.000Z	jmichel		anyway, I'm in a hurry, I'll come back later to discuss it ;o)
2004-11-17T08:19:00.000Z	jmichel		by everyone
2004-11-17T08:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jmichel	I guess so. I'm not a developer so I can't say
