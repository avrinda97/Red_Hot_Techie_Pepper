2009-07-04T04:48:00.000Z	^Phantom^		Is it bad that I inadvertently installed the KDE Desktop Environment?
2009-07-04T04:48:00.000Z	nellmathew	^Phantom^	you can have multiple desktop environments..
2009-07-04T04:50:00.000Z	nellmathew	^Phantom^	you can just uninstall it, sudo apt-get autoremove kubuntu-desktop
2009-07-04T05:00:00.000Z	nellmathew	^Phantom^	you don't want any KDE applications at all right?
2009-07-04T05:04:00.000Z	nellmathew	^Phantom^	yeah it should
2009-07-04T05:08:00.000Z	nellmathew	^Phantom^	http://code.google.com/p/dolphin-emu/wiki/Linux_dependencies - check if your version of scons is > 0.98 also like they suggest (if you have issues with it).. and check the command to run it also..
2009-07-04T05:13:00.000Z	^Phantom^	nellmathew	 I'm quite confused

2009-07-04T05:21:00.000Z	nellmathew	^Phantom^	libsdl1.2debian
2009-07-04T05:22:00.000Z	nellmathew	^Phantom^	sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2debian-all (use this instead)
2009-07-04T05:25:00.000Z	^Phantom^	nellmathew	Now I'm still getting errors with the make process.  I've pastebin'd the output:  http://pastebin.com/d76796260
2009-07-04T05:30:00.000Z	nellmathew	^Phantom^	try, sudo apt-get install libsdl-image1.2-dev if that doesn't work i'm not too sure
2009-07-04T05:30:00.000Z	^Phantom^	nellmathew	 I also downloaded this version of the Dolphin gamecube emulator:  http://www.dolphin-emu.com/downloads.php?cat_id=2&download_id=77
2009-07-04T05:31:00.000Z	^Phantom^	nellmathew	 However, I can't get it to work.  Clearly I'm stupid and am not doing something right...
2009-07-04T05:33:00.000Z	nellmathew	^Phantom^	http://code.google.com/p/dolphin-emu/wiki/Linux_dependencies - read the 2nd comment.. make sure the scons version is as they require (over 0.98 - check in synaptic), if it isn't then download the 1.1.0 package and run the command to install it..
2009-07-04T05:34:00.000Z	nellmathew	^Phantom^	make sure you have all the "required packages" installed from "details"
2009-07-04T05:37:00.000Z	nellmathew	^Phantom^	no it's a replacement... some people still use it, you can have both.
2009-07-04T05:39:00.000Z	^Phantom^	nellmathew	When I try to run dolphin from that 2MB zip I downloaded, I get this:  ./Dolphin: error while loading shared libraries: libbluetooth.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
2009-07-04T05:40:00.000Z	nellmathew	^Phantom^	I'm really not familiar with dolphin or tuxcube, but personally I would try to install packages libbluetooth and libbluetooth-dev and try again
2009-07-04T05:41:00.000Z	nellmathew	^Phantom^	if the program requires the packages then yes.
2009-07-04T05:44:00.000Z	^Phantom^	nellmathew	apparently I already have the bluetooth stuff installed...
