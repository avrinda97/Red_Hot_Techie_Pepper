2006-07-31T08:10:00.000Z	diesel		Anyone have any idea why my gnome-cups-manager does not list any printers at all?
2006-07-31T08:11:00.000Z	sethk	diesel	it hasn't found any printers.  How is your printer connected?
2006-07-31T08:11:00.000Z	diesel	sethk	usb
2006-07-31T08:11:00.000Z	sethk	diesel	does lsusb show it?
2006-07-31T08:12:00.000Z	sethk	diesel	when you turn the printer on, does dmesg show it as a new device?
2006-07-31T08:12:00.000Z	diesel	sethk	yes
2006-07-31T08:12:00.000Z	diesel	sethk	lsusb shows the device
2006-07-31T08:12:00.000Z	sethk	diesel	go through the add printer sequence.  Hopefully, when you get to the port setting, it will appear on the list of available ports.
2006-07-31T08:13:00.000Z	diesel	sethk	gnome-cups-manager shows it as a detected device, but then installing drivers gives me no option of manufacturers
2006-07-31T08:13:00.000Z	sethk	diesel	that sounds like the cups printer configuration file creation package needs to be install
2006-07-31T08:13:00.000Z	diesel	sethk	what is that package?
2006-07-31T08:14:00.000Z	sethk	diesel	in synaptic, do a search for cups, see what shows as not yet installed
2006-07-31T08:15:00.000Z	sethk	diesel	I think cupsys-driver-gimpprint and cupsys-driver-gimpprint-data will do it.
2006-07-31T08:15:00.000Z	sethk	diesel	but if they are already installed, then I'm wrong  :)
2006-07-31T08:17:00.000Z	diesel	sethk	those are not installed...will do that, then get back to you
2006-07-31T08:17:00.000Z	sethk	diesel	k
2006-07-31T08:25:00.000Z	diesel	sethk	I installed cupsys-driver-gimpprint
2006-07-31T08:25:00.000Z	diesel	sethk	however cupsys-driver-gimpprint-data was not found
2006-07-31T08:25:00.000Z	sethk	diesel	I show it in my synaptic.  possibly you don't have all repositories enabled?
2006-07-31T08:26:00.000Z	diesel	sethk	I have universe and multivers
2006-07-31T08:28:00.000Z	diesel	sethk	a search on packages.ubuntu.com also does not find cupsys-driver-gimpprint-data
