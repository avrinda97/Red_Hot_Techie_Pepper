2007-01-24T09:09:00.000Z	Dirtbag		Hi everyone, have any of you tried ubuntu on an ibm laptop?
2007-01-24T09:09:00.000Z	Spasticteapot	Dirtbag	I'm running on a Thinkpad X40.
2007-01-24T09:09:00.000Z	Spasticteapot	Dirtbag	Ubuntu has top-notch compatibility for almost all models of Thinkpad.
2007-01-24T09:13:00.000Z	Dirtbag	Spasticteapot	No p4  15.1"
2007-01-24T09:13:00.000Z	Spasticteapot	Dirtbag	Huh.
2007-01-24T09:14:00.000Z	Spasticteapot	Dirtbag	D'oh! That's the A21.
2007-01-24T09:14:00.000Z	Spasticteapot	Dirtbag	You should have PERFECT compatibility right from the Get-Go.
2007-01-24T09:14:00.000Z	Dirtbag	Spasticteapot	lol no A31p laptop =)
2007-01-24T09:15:00.000Z	Spasticteapot	Dirtbag	I'm using Xubuntu, and everything worked perfectly with a fresh install on my Thinkpad X40.
2007-01-24T09:15:00.000Z	Spasticteapot	Dirtbag	Even suspend - they rolled all the Thinkpad support bits into the kernel,  I think.
2007-01-24T09:15:00.000Z	Spasticteapot	Dirtbag	Go get a new hard drive, install, and enjoy.
2007-01-24T09:18:00.000Z	Dirtbag	Spasticteapot	Oops I didnt explain my problem good, Sorry. It installs just fine. Im dual booting so I can learn ubuntu on my spare time. My problem is how do I get my built in repir disk, backed up. I have a new HD.
2007-01-24T09:19:00.000Z	Spasticteapot	Dirtbag	Use QTparted to copy the partition to an external drive.
2007-01-24T09:19:00.000Z	Dirtbag	Spasticteapot	YUP!
2007-01-24T09:21:00.000Z	Dirtbag	Spasticteapot	QTparted will reconize the hidden partition?
2007-01-24T09:21:00.000Z	Spasticteapot	Dirtbag	It's not hidden. Most IBM laptops use FAT32 or sometimes NTFS for the restore partition.
2007-01-24T09:22:00.000Z	Dirtbag	Spasticteapot	Yeah I think its fat32
2007-01-24T09:22:00.000Z	Spasticteapot	Dirtbag	It should copy it just fine.
2007-01-24T09:22:00.000Z	Dirtbag	Spasticteapot	Ok thank you very much!
2007-01-24T09:23:00.000Z	Spasticteapot	Dirtbag	Or, for the "brute force" approach, remove the HDD, connect it (via $3 2.5" to 3.5" adapter) and copy the partition to the desktop's hard drive.
2007-01-24T09:23:00.000Z	Dirtbag	Spasticteapot	Ill do both just to make sure it works =)
