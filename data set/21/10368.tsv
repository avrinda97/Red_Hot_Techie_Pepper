2005-03-30T12:57:00.000Z	DarthFrog	nic__	ACPI works in Hoary.
2005-03-30T13:39:00.000Z	DarthFrog	nic__	No, he's telling you that it's not exactly rational to come onto an Ubuntu support channel and expect us to recommend anything else. :-)
2005-03-30T13:42:00.000Z	DarthFrog	nic__	Try Xandros.
2005-03-30T13:43:00.000Z	nic__	DarthFrog	hmm I wanted to try that too but I was a bit afraid
2005-03-30T13:43:00.000Z	DarthFrog	nic__	What are you afraid of?  Xandos is very easy.
2005-03-30T13:44:00.000Z	nic__	DarthFrog	I just saw there was a poor wifi support, and not a lot of packages
2005-03-30T13:45:00.000Z	DarthFrog	nic__	Xandros is a debian-variant.  The whole of Debian is available to Xandros users.
2005-03-30T13:45:00.000Z	nic__	DarthFrog	ha really? I didn't even know that :p
2005-03-30T13:45:00.000Z	nic__	DarthFrog	but its kde
2005-03-30T13:45:00.000Z	nic__	DarthFrog	there is a free version
2005-03-30T13:46:00.000Z	DarthFrog	nic__	You'll get no argument from me about using KDE. :-)
