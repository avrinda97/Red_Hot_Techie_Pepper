2011-02-03T12:46:00.000Z	pranay_09	ActionParsnip	when i log into the laptop it by default goes to runlevel 2 , i want to go to graphics mode ,  i even changed the telinit 2 to telnint 5 in /etc/event.d/rc-default  file but still when i log in i don't get into graphical mode
2011-02-03T12:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pranay_09	the default behavior is to boot desktop. Did you change the boot options any to boot to text mode?
2011-02-03T12:49:00.000Z	pranay_09	ActionParsnip	no
2011-02-03T12:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pranay_09	if not then you should check in /var/log/Xorg.0.log for why the x server isn't loading
2011-02-03T12:53:00.000Z	pranay_09	ActionParsnip	it's a long file what should i look for?
