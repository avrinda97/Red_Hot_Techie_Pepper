2006-10-09T09:18:00.000Z	ArrenLex		...please ignore me.
2006-10-09T09:19:00.000Z	ArrenLex		Gk-s2: I saw it, man.
2006-10-09T09:20:00.000Z	ArrenLex		Sorry, I don't know... you should be fine. The best I can tell you is to suggest a guide that worked for me with an nvidia card. But you should be fine and I don't know what your problem is. Sorry.

2006-10-09T09:21:00.000Z	ArrenLex		Lam: mplayer and mencoder, respectively! :D
2006-10-09T09:21:00.000Z	Lam_	ArrenLex	lol thanks
2006-10-14T12:16:00.000Z	Lam_	ArrenLex	mind if i ask how you got your alias?
2006-10-14T12:17:00.000Z	Lam_	ArrenLex	yeah. i'm in need of a new email alias
2006-10-14T12:18:00.000Z	Lam_	ArrenLex	i'm just curious as to what the thought process people put into aliases, and i find your interesting
2006-10-26T11:24:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Lam_	I don't know. How about uploading one so we can see?

2006-10-26T11:31:00.000Z	Lam_	ArrenLex	lol no. nothing of the sort. it might be some configuration setting or some shit.  i'm not entirely sure
2006-10-26T11:28:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Lam_	checked it out in a hexeditor. That file is completely blank -- all zeros. Nothing's going to play that. =P
2006-10-26T11:29:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Lam_	yes.
2006-10-26T11:30:00.000Z	Lam_	ArrenLex	thanks for the heads up. i guess i'll have to relook into that.
2006-10-26T11:30:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Lam_	where did you get this mysterious blank file?
2006-10-26T11:30:00.000Z	Lam_	ArrenLex	gftp into a friend's ftp server
2006-10-26T11:31:00.000Z	Lam_	ArrenLex	plus, 40kb/s for 24 hours isn't really pleasant for anyone, ticked off or not ;)
2006-10-26T11:32:00.000Z	Lam_	ArrenLex	but yeah. thanks for that catch. i guess i should have tried a hex editor when i realized it was missing codec information
2006-10-26T11:33:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Lam_	"file" is your all-purpose something-is-wrong detector. I ran file on it and it said "data". That was my flag.
2006-10-26T11:33:00.000Z	Lam_	ArrenLex	that's good to know.  i'll remember that. thanks a lot
