2006-09-12T10:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Flannel	 then what did he   change the group of?

2011-05-08T16:25:00.000Z	Flannel	Dr_Willis	No, it's always been that way.
2011-05-08T16:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Flannel	 i dont recall ever seeing that option in the dozen times vie used the alt-cd.
2011-05-08T16:26:00.000Z	Flannel	Dr_Willis	It used to be an option on the main screen ("Install a command line system"), then it got moved to an install option ... probably in 10.10 or maybe 10.04, so you had to hit f4 or f5 or whatever to select it.
