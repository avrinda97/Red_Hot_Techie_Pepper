2009-05-05T05:25:00.000Z	randomusr		In gnome, what's the best windows manager to look glassy like vista?
2009-05-05T05:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	randomusr	 its not the window manager that looks that way.. but compiz + the emerald window decorator can look a lot like vista.
2009-05-05T05:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	randomusr	 you might have to make your own emerald theme, or find one to download.
2009-05-05T05:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	randomusr	 compiz can use one of several 'window decorators' a GTK/gnome based one, a KDE/qt based one, or Emerald..
2009-05-05T05:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	randomusr	 each has its own 'look'
2009-05-05T05:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	randomusr	 if you want somthing that can look like XP/Vista/Windows  glassy stuff -> emerald can
2009-05-05T05:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	randomusr	 then you are not going to get a very Glassy Looking theme.
2010-02-21T09:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	randomusr	 once i switched to DVI the picture was so much better.. i NEVER want to use vga again
2010-02-21T09:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	randomusr	 ive told dozens of people at work.. if you can use DVI then USE dvi..
2010-02-21T09:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	randomusr	 ICK. i would definatly use dvi if the sytem supports it
2010-02-21T10:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	randomusr	 the tool 'ubuntu-tweak' lets you use one or the other/installed it easially
2010-02-21T10:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	randomusr	 yes
2010-02-21T10:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	randomusr	 and costs more $$$
2010-02-21T10:38:00.000Z	randomusr	Dr_Willis	is there no installable filesystem driver for ext4 on win crap
2010-02-21T10:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	randomusr	 the tools i use int he past dont support ext4. ive not tried them lately
2010-02-23T07:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	randomusr	 i used GRIP ages ago.. but theres dozens of tools that can rip audio cd to files.
2010-02-23T07:39:00.000Z	randomusr	Dr_Willis	isn't GRIP command line?
2010-02-23T07:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	randomusr	 No.
2010-02-23T07:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	randomusr	 but it is a little old. and may not be around any more
2010-02-23T07:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	randomusr	 about any of the main media player  tools can do it now a days
2010-02-28T07:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	randomusr	 never seen it work that way.
