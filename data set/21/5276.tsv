2007-11-20T22:12:00.000Z	guitrokr123		has anyone else had HORRIBLE experiences with upgrading to Gutsy... Feisty worked great, and now nothing works right anymore... gutsy is a HUGE step backwards!
2007-11-20T22:12:00.000Z	guitrokr123		i can't suspend or hibernate!
2007-11-20T22:12:00.000Z	guitrokr123		i shut down my computer like 9 times a day because i always need to suspend and take it to class
2007-11-20T22:13:00.000Z	guitrokr123		my resolution is weird now.. my login splash is nonexistent, and now gutsy takes LONGER to boot than windows!  and compiz fails after alil use
2007-11-20T22:14:00.000Z	guitrokr123		please do wait
2007-11-20T22:14:00.000Z	guitrokr123		until they weed out the bugs
2007-11-20T22:14:00.000Z	guitrokr123		i wish so much that there was a reverse option
2007-11-20T22:14:00.000Z	VSpike	guitrokr123	it screwed my system - just doing a clean install now
2007-11-20T22:14:00.000Z	guitrokr123		i use thunderbird
2007-11-20T22:15:00.000Z	guitrokr123		clean install of feisty or gutsy again VSpike?
2007-11-20T22:15:00.000Z	VSpike	guitrokr123	it's called restoring the full system backup you took before upgrading, surely? :)
2007-11-20T22:15:00.000Z	VSpike	guitrokr123	note, I didnt have one either :D
2007-11-20T22:15:00.000Z	guitrokr123		haha
2007-11-20T22:15:00.000Z	VSpike	guitrokr123	gutsy - I'm hoping the upgrade was the problem
2007-11-20T22:16:00.000Z	guitrokr123	VSpike	i would go with feisty
2007-11-20T22:16:00.000Z	guitrokr123		i loved feisty
2007-11-20T22:16:00.000Z	guitrokr123		its what made me a linux user 100%
2007-11-20T22:17:00.000Z	guitrokr123		between feisty and gutsy i lost functionality of so many things, everything is slower, i get crashes and horrible stuff all the time, the only one thing that worked was that a wine install of a windows program i REALLY like finally worked in gutsy... thats the ONLY thing that improved
2007-11-20T22:17:00.000Z	guitrokr123		and i'm not sure if that was wine or the new gutsy version that made it possible
2007-11-20T22:18:00.000Z	VSpike	guitrokr123	gutsy seems faster for me once I got it working, and nice to have packaged versions of all the stuff I had to find for feisty, like latest thunderbird, firefox, nvidia driver, etc.
2007-11-20T22:20:00.000Z	guitrokr123	VSpike	it seems different for me, i found i had to do alot of manual work to get things to work in feisty... but finally i had it how i liked it and gutsy removed all functionality
