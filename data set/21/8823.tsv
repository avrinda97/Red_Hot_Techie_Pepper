2006-03-09T13:00:00.000Z	globe		how do instal an rpm?
2006-03-09T13:01:00.000Z	globe		its either tar or rpm
2006-03-09T13:02:00.000Z	globe		I can compile it....I just cant remember the commands
2006-03-09T13:03:00.000Z	oskude	globe	classical, ./configure && make && make install
2006-03-09T13:03:00.000Z	globe	oskude	yep...thanks
2006-03-09T13:04:00.000Z	oskude	globe	but i would replace "make install" with err, forgot... (a program that easily makes a .deb from it for better management)
2006-03-09T13:06:00.000Z	oskude	globe	yes, linux can easily use fat32
2006-03-09T13:06:00.000Z	oskude	globe	sry was missreading that message
2006-03-09T13:07:00.000Z	globe	oskude	np....question though.  why would I want to make a deb if I am just going to compile?
2006-03-09T13:07:00.000Z	oskude	globe	if you do "make install" its mostly hard to get away from the system...
2006-03-09T13:09:00.000Z	oskude	globe	make install install your compiled program systemwide, theres normally a "make uninstall" (or similar) but mostly that doesnt work right, so you use checkinstall, and for removing the program, you just do "dpkg -r packagename"
2006-03-09T13:09:00.000Z	globe	oskude	nice.
2006-03-09T13:09:00.000Z	globe	oskude	gnomefreak, thx
2006-03-09T13:10:00.000Z	oskude	globe	a good tip, add your name (or something constant) to the deb package name so you can easily find them later (in system)
2006-03-09T13:16:00.000Z	globe	oskude	thk for your help so far.  When I make checkinstall where does it put the deb?
2006-03-09T13:18:00.000Z	oskude	globe	should be there where you started that command
2006-03-09T13:19:00.000Z	oskude	globe	normally it installs it automaticly
2006-03-09T13:19:00.000Z	oskude	globe	the nevest checkinstall has an option for not installing automaticly
2006-03-09T13:20:00.000Z	oskude	globe	havent used checkinstall since hoary, so dunno what version breezy has
2006-03-09T13:44:00.000Z	oskude	globe	check in /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2006-03-09T13:44:00.000Z	oskude	globe	and look for (EE)
