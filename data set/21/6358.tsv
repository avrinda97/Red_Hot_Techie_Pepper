2007-04-19T14:13:00.000Z	nir_ai		is it reasonable to have a main partition of 30GB, or is it too small? Does Linux software know to install on other partitions by default?
2007-04-19T14:13:00.000Z	dystopianray	nir_ai	it depends on where you mount the partitions
2007-04-19T14:14:00.000Z	nir_ai	dystopianray	what do you mean?
2007-04-19T14:14:00.000Z	dystopianray	nir_ai	installations have no knowledge of physical disks, they'll install into /usr, what partition that is depends on what you mount there
2007-04-19T14:14:00.000Z	dystopianray	nir_ai	i take you are unfamiliar with the basics of unix filesystems?
2007-04-19T14:15:00.000Z	nir_ai	dystopianray	that's right
2007-04-19T14:15:00.000Z	dystopianray	nir_ai	installed programs go to /usr, if you want them installed on a different partition, you mount that partition on /usr
2007-04-19T14:16:00.000Z	nir_ai	dystopianray	but then I only see part of the installed software at a given time. is this true?
2007-04-19T14:17:00.000Z	dystopianray	nir_ai	tell the installer to use the partition for /usr and everything will go onto that partition
2007-04-19T14:18:00.000Z	nir_ai	dystopianray	if I switch /usr to another partition a month from now, all the software already installed will just "disappear"?
2007-04-19T14:19:00.000Z	dystopianray	nir_ai	that's right, if you want to permanently use another parition, then you must move the existing files onto that partition
2007-04-19T14:19:00.000Z	nir_ai	dystopianray	interesting.
2007-04-19T14:20:00.000Z	dystopianray	nir_ai	every filesystem is mounted somewhere in the / hierarchy, there is no concept of seperate hierarchies for different devices
2007-04-19T14:20:00.000Z	nir_ai	dystopianray	so I can actually move the entire installation to a new partition in this manner?
2007-04-19T14:21:00.000Z	dystopianray	nir_ai	sure
2007-04-19T14:21:00.000Z	dystopianray	nir_ai	but you must remember to update /etc/fstab
2007-04-19T14:21:00.000Z	dystopianray	nir_ai	so that it knows what to mount and where
2007-04-19T14:22:00.000Z	nir_ai		i'll drop by for assistance when the day to move partitions arrives.
2007-04-19T14:24:00.000Z	nir_ai	dystopianray	I am a Windows developer. I discovered Ubuntu 2 month ago when developing os-indiferent software (in Python) and was amazed. Now I want to attempt a gradual switch to Ubuntu...!
2007-04-19T14:25:00.000Z	dystopianray	nir_ai	well it's rather easy to move things to different partitions, just copy and update fstab
2007-04-19T14:26:00.000Z	nir_ai	dystopianray	thanks
