2007-12-23T06:27:00.000Z	Arcusmay		WHen I go to burn the cd, it says select an ISO image to create. Do I select the ubuntu file?
2007-12-23T06:28:00.000Z	Pelo	Arcusmay	if you want to burn the ubuntu cd yes
2007-12-23T06:28:00.000Z	Pelo	Arcusmay	hold on
2007-12-23T06:28:00.000Z	Pelo	Arcusmay	what are you using to burn the cd ? what app ?
2007-12-23T06:29:00.000Z	Arcusmay	Pelo	- Express Burn
2007-12-23T06:30:00.000Z	Pelo	Arcusmay	I don't know that one, but many apps have this option where you are creating a .iso image instead of burning to a cd, make sure you don't hae a burn to a file  option checked and that you are burning to a cd
2007-12-23T06:31:00.000Z	Arcusmay	Pelo	it says, Select enter an iso image to create. And it says save..if i try to save to the cd, it says i don't have permission
2007-12-23T06:32:00.000Z	Pelo	Arcusmay	you are doing this from ubuntu ?
2007-12-23T06:33:00.000Z	Arcusmay	Pelo	I downloaded Ubuntu from the website, now I am trying to burn it to cd
2007-12-23T06:33:00.000Z	Pelo	Arcusmay	 what os are you using right now ?
2007-12-23T06:35:00.000Z	Pelo	Arcusmay	I think you'll need to go in the settings for the ap you are using and select a burn device, it is very hard to tell since I don't know the app
2007-12-23T06:37:00.000Z	Pelo	Arcusmay	it very probably wonT' be where you got to select the file to burn to that you were getting earlier,  , maybe you are using the wrong option in the menus,  if you are making an iso , this is not it,  you should be looking for burn image to cd or something similar
