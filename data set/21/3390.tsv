2009-01-08T12:57:00.000Z	sidney__		is super ubuntu any easier to use
2009-01-08T12:58:00.000Z	ksbalaji	sidney__	thanks you asked. I was also about to ask about this. Any users?
2009-01-08T12:59:00.000Z	sidney__		hope it's more user friendly
2009-01-08T13:00:00.000Z	ksbalaji	sidney__	I understand that it is DVD live booter with extra applications loaded and updated monthly.
2009-01-08T13:02:00.000Z	ksbalaji		With super ubuntu, someone mentioned that regular updates is messy. We have to install and do a bit of tinkering to enable updates.
2009-01-08T13:03:00.000Z	sidney__	ksbalaji	maybe i'll just download and play around for awhile
2009-01-08T13:04:00.000Z	ksbalaji	sidney__	yeah! your opinion then will be of much use here!
2009-01-08T13:05:00.000Z	ksbalaji	sidney__	one information - you get hold of a latest superubuntu torrent file and then download. It will be faster than from a single site.
2009-01-08T13:06:00.000Z	sidney__		ksbalaji_. just hope it's worth the trouble of removing a hard drive to install a dvd
2009-01-08T13:07:00.000Z	ksbalaji	sidney__	since it is live bootable, you need not remove your existing OS. Check up the site info before installing. Sorry I forgot the site link.
2009-01-08T13:10:00.000Z	sidney__		ksbalaji__' i have the site but this is a dual system with a blown IDE header so i have to remove the XP drive to install a DVD rom
2009-01-08T13:12:00.000Z	sidney__		it seems i had ubuntu installed before and could see the windows shared network folders
2009-01-08T13:12:00.000Z	ksbalaji	sidney__	I wish to remind you that super ubuntu is live DVD - You boot from the DVD instead of from hard drive. Hence you have the option of using the DVD and playing with the applications before choosing to install!
2009-01-08T13:14:00.000Z	ksbalaji	sidney__	if you do not have a DVD drive, you may have to install one.
2009-01-08T13:15:00.000Z	ksbalaji		I have firestarter installed. I wish to know other firewalls running in my system. Also, can someone suggest the best firewall for Ubuntu Hardy? - In terms of easy usage, configurability, effectiveness.....
2009-01-08T13:15:00.000Z	sidney__		ksbalaji__' i will have to install one. and is there a short cut for posting these names?
2009-01-08T13:16:00.000Z	ksbalaji	sidney__	? names? :(
2009-01-08T13:16:00.000Z	sidney__		like your name when i responde
2009-01-08T13:17:00.000Z	ksbalaji	sidney__	do you mean copying and pasting user names? I just type in a few letters and press tab. Bingo :)
2009-01-08T13:17:00.000Z	sidney__	ksbalaji	wow
2009-01-08T13:18:00.000Z	sidney__	ksbalaji	thanks
