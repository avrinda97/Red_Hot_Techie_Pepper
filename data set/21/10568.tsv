2006-11-03T15:03:00.000Z	joeljkp		is there a way to reference a samba share on the command line?  like "cp \\share\file ."?
2006-11-03T15:03:00.000Z	joeljkp		tonren: hmm, so the only way is to mount the share as a directory?
2006-11-03T15:03:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	joeljkp	Samba has a few command line clients for copying files
2006-11-03T15:04:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	joeljkp	you can additionally install LUFS, which is Linux Userland Filesystems, and one of the modules it provides allows you to dynamically browse the Microsoft Network
2006-11-03T15:04:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	joeljkp	e.g. you can add /mnt/samba
2006-11-03T15:05:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	joeljkp	I'm not sure if it's available prebuilt on Ubuntu or not, I can grab you their web site if you like
2006-11-03T15:05:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	joeljkp	http://lufs.sourceforge.net/lufs/fs.html  << that's the list of filesystem modules it can create virtual filesystems for
2006-11-03T15:06:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	joeljkp	that just mounts a single share, it is not a dynamic network browser
2006-11-03T15:07:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	joeljkp	hm, apparently it doesn't directly support Samba, but it can use Gnome's virtual filesystem modules.  hm
2006-11-03T15:08:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	joeljkp	virtual filesystems can do neat things.  like SSH, FTP, even P2P filesharing networks like Gnutella, so that listing a directory is actually doing a search, etc.
2007-05-14T11:35:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	joeljkp	if you use ALSA, then you have no OSS.  you have only "OSS Emulation" which simply means ALSA converts requests for OSS sound into normal ALSA requests
2007-05-14T11:35:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	joeljkp	meaning dmix will mix both for you
2007-05-14T11:36:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	joeljkp	and neither one are needed if your soundcard can mix multiple sounds in hardware.  mine for example can mix 12 in hardware.  some cheaper soundcards only do software mixing
2007-05-14T11:37:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	joeljkp	so it will be like Windows 2000 and above: you can always play more than one sound at a time, no matter what soundcard you have.  Gnome uses ESD, KDE uses ARTS.  its their way of making sure people don't have the "only one sound at a time" issue
2007-05-14T11:37:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	joeljkp	dmix is not usually set up
2007-05-14T11:38:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	joeljkp	ESD and ARTS are part of the Gnome and KDE packages.  they aren't related to ALSA in any way
2007-05-14T11:40:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	joeljkp	I have no idea if Ubuntu sets up dmix by default, but most distros do not.  if it is set up, then esd should not be needed.  try this: mv /usr/bin/esd /tmp; kill $(ps auxww|awk '/esd/ {print $2}')
2007-05-14T11:41:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	joeljkp	then see if you can still play more than one sound at a time.  if not, mv /tmp/esd /usr/bin
2007-05-14T11:41:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	joeljkp	you'll need "sudo" before those 'mv' commands, as they need to be done by root
2007-05-14T11:45:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	joeljkp	did you also kill the processes with that ps|awk command ?
2007-05-14T11:46:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	joeljkp	it will still be running even if you move the exe file
