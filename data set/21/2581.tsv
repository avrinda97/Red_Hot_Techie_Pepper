2010-01-15T06:13:00.000Z	dabukalam		does anyone have any experience with network scanning?
2010-01-15T06:13:00.000Z	hattoricaca1	dabukalam	what do you want to do?
2010-01-15T06:15:00.000Z	dabukalam	hattoricaca1	I want to share my scanner over the network. I have an Ubuntu Server running 9.04, and two scanners are connected. I just want one of the to work
2010-01-15T06:16:00.000Z	dabukalam	hattoricaca1	before, scanimage used to work for root
2010-01-15T06:16:00.000Z	dabukalam	hattoricaca1	but now nothing works after i've been tinkering for the last 4 hours
2010-01-15T06:17:00.000Z	dabukalam	hattoricaca1	I don't mind how it's done, whether web interface or through a client, but I need it to work on Linux, Mac, and Windows
2010-01-15T06:17:00.000Z	dabukalam	hattoricaca1	can you help me out?
2010-01-15T06:17:00.000Z	hattoricaca1	dabukalam	sorry i thought you were talking bout another kind of network scanning, i havent tried to use image scanners over network, i recall there's the SANE framework, but dunno if it serves to share scanners over network
2010-01-15T06:18:00.000Z	hattoricaca1	dabukalam	what have you tried so far?
2010-01-15T06:18:00.000Z	dabukalam	hattoricaca1	sanewi, phpSANE, SaneTwain, console commands, playing with ownership of the scanner, playing with groups and memberships
2010-01-15T06:19:00.000Z	hattoricaca1	dabukalam	i'll try to help, but remind you: i have zero experience on that
2010-01-15T06:20:00.000Z	dabukalam	hattoricaca1	all help is welcome!
2010-01-15T06:21:00.000Z	hattoricaca1	dabukalam	ok, lemme see what are the tools used in ubuntu
2010-01-15T06:23:00.000Z	hattoricaca1	dabukalam	what about this? http://scannerserver.online02.com/node/12
2010-01-15T06:24:00.000Z	hattoricaca1	dabukalam	also http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=679028 and http://ubuntu.online02.com/linux_scan_server (same guy)
2010-01-15T06:25:00.000Z	dabukalam	hattoricaca1	sweet, looks like he's automated the process, let me check this out and get back to you
2010-01-15T06:26:00.000Z	hattoricaca1		good luck :-)
2010-01-15T06:42:00.000Z	dabukalam	hattoricaca1	yeah, it's a great app, but it's got the same problem as the others, which is derived from the fact that the scanimage command doesn't work
2010-01-15T06:44:00.000Z	hattoricaca1	dabukalam	but then your problem reduces to make that command work? why it fails?
2010-01-15T06:44:00.000Z	dabukalam	hattoricaca1	i'm looking it up now. Not sure to be totally honest
2010-01-15T06:45:00.000Z	hattoricaca1	dabukalam	" grep --color scanimage /var/log/* " might help
