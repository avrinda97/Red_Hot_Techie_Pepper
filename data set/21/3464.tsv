2009-01-18T19:09:00.000Z	harlemdavvey		guys is there any way to install a package of icons? because i don't know where to put the icons sets i download from the net..
2009-01-18T19:10:00.000Z	outbackwifi	harlemdavvey	one way is to extract them and copy them into /usr/share/icons
2009-01-18T19:10:00.000Z	harlemdavvey	outbackwifi	you mean extracting the icons in a new folder or the icons themselves?
2009-01-18T19:10:00.000Z	outbackwifi	harlemdavvey	i would extract them into a new directory that clearly identifies that icon set
2009-01-18T19:11:00.000Z	outbackwifi	harlemdavvey	this then shows up in the preferences menu
