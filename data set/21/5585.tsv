2008-03-08T07:36:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Bradley	i doubt its 48% COMPLETE all ready, i think it installs the kernel, then installs all the software.
2008-03-08T07:36:00.000Z	Bradley	IndyGunFreak	maybe, i started a bit agot, but it say Installing System and the Copying Files
2008-03-08T07:37:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Bradley	ok, then you're actually installing now.. it usually takes about 10-15min for me..
2008-03-08T07:38:00.000Z	Bradley	IndyGunFreak	Well its not moving as fast as b4 but its at 63... so yeah!
2008-03-08T07:38:00.000Z	Bradley	IndyGunFreak	hey just wondering should i duel boot to windows, use a VM... and if so should windows be the host or guest OS?
2008-03-08T07:39:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Bradley	if you need windows, i would recommend dual booting
2008-03-08T07:40:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Bradley	there's some Linux alternatives to Itunes
2008-03-08T07:40:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Bradley	yes he was..lol
2008-03-08T07:41:00.000Z	Bradley	IndyGunFreak	that sucks that Steam coudnt give him the password, but i feel his pain
2008-03-08T07:41:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Bradley	do you use Itunes to buy music, or do yo steal it like the rest of us, adn just use itunes to sync your ipod?
2008-03-08T07:42:00.000Z	Bradley	IndyGunFreak	i buy some stuff, and limewire some... but i have an Iphone, and im not sure that it sinks with anyother piece of software but Itunes yet.... also im not too much into opensource, i like the Microsoft, and thrid party touch
2008-03-08T07:43:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Bradley	yeah, it might be best to dualboot in that situation...
2008-03-08T07:43:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Bradley	i've gort a GPS device, that as hell getting to work under LInux... so after a year and a half of being windows free, I had to give Windows 20gigs fo my 200gig hard drive.. i probably boot it 2x a month
2008-03-08T07:44:00.000Z	Bradley	IndyGunFreak	can you do both, a duel and a VM?
2008-03-08T07:44:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Bradley	i don't see why you couldn't
2008-03-08T07:44:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Bradley	might be a bit redundant
2008-03-08T07:45:00.000Z	Bradley	IndyGunFreak	cool, hey btw linux, just found XP which i thought i didnt have anymore
2008-03-08T07:45:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Bradley	well, apparently you do
2008-03-08T07:46:00.000Z	Bradley	IndyGunFreak	nm, it was just an Acer recovery thingy... but Windows Vista, is still there
