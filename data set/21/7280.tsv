2006-10-29T11:05:00.000Z	jcorgan		I have a seriously broken breezy->edgy upgrade on a server with software RAID1 as the root partition, anyone want to slog through it with me?
2006-10-29T11:06:00.000Z	screechingcat	jcorgan	u shouldnt have done a breezy > edgy
2006-10-29T11:06:00.000Z	jcorgan	screechingcat	no shit
2006-10-29T11:07:00.000Z	screechingcat	jcorgan	dapper to edgy is leaving many people with badly broken systems
2006-10-29T11:07:00.000Z	screechingcat	jcorgan	breezy to edgy must be a hundered times as bad
2006-10-29T11:07:00.000Z	screechingcat	jcorgan	do a fresh reinstall
2006-10-29T11:09:00.000Z	screechingcat	jcorgan	download an edgy alt cd and do a fresh install
2006-10-29T11:10:00.000Z	jcorgan	screechingcat	what's different about the alt CD that would make it work to see the drives?  Just asking before I spend 2 hrs downloading the ISO
2006-10-29T11:11:00.000Z	screechingcat	jcorgan	its not about the alt cd. u can use the live if u want. its just that a fresh install always has no problems whereas an upgrade is just filled with broken crap
2006-10-29T11:12:00.000Z	jcorgan	screechingcat	it's worse than that, though, booting from the kernel on a live 6.10 CD, it can't access the SATA drives (they spew out handling errors to the console), yet booting from 2.6.10 on Knoppix CD lets me see and access everything with no errors
2006-10-29T11:13:00.000Z	screechingcat	jcorgan	what about a 6.06 live cd ?
2006-10-29T11:13:00.000Z	screechingcat	jcorgan	or a 6.06 alt cd ?
2006-10-29T11:14:00.000Z	screechingcat	jcorgan	i recommend u keep 6.06 upgrading to edgy is just not worth it at the moment
2006-10-29T11:14:00.000Z	screechingcat	jcorgan	maybe when the first big  update line for 6.10 comes out (6.10.1 i guess) then u can update
2006-10-29T11:18:00.000Z	screechingcat	jcorgan	i have no idea. no one else seems to have this problem. my own SATA drive is perfectly recognized and partitioned
2006-10-29T11:18:00.000Z	screechingcat	jcorgan	do u have windows ?
2006-10-29T11:19:00.000Z	jcorgan	screechingcat	you mean a windows install CD?  yes, though I'd have to go find it
2006-10-29T11:19:00.000Z	screechingcat	jcorgan	no i mean windows installed on your computer ?
2006-10-29T11:19:00.000Z	jcorgan	screechingcat	no
2006-10-29T11:20:00.000Z	screechingcat	jcorgan	i had a similar problem once (dapper live dint recognize my hard disk) and i booted windows and did all the partitioning in Partition Magic and reinserted the live cd and everything worked
2006-10-29T11:21:00.000Z	screechingcat	jcorgan	good luck mate
