2006-11-26T10:51:00.000Z	Jim		I've been doing about 2 straight days of work trying to get my video card to work
2006-11-26T10:51:00.000Z	Jim		Did I lag out?
2006-11-26T10:53:00.000Z	Jim		Hello, I have been trying to get my video card to work for about two days straight.
2006-11-26T10:54:00.000Z	Jim		Can someone please help me with it?
2006-11-26T10:54:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Jim	what kind of video card?
2006-11-26T10:54:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Jim	what package?
2006-11-26T10:55:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Jim	did you read the wiki already?
2006-11-26T10:56:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Jim	what error do you get?
2006-11-26T10:59:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Jim	did you install all the requisite packages? The kernel source? What does the installer log say?
2006-11-26T11:00:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Jim	does the installer get anywhere, or it just refuses to start?
2006-11-26T11:01:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Jim	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop <-- that will kill X for you
2006-11-26T11:02:00.000Z	Jim	fyrestrtr	thank you very much
2006-11-26T11:02:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Jim	open a new console (cltr+alt+f1) login and then type sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
2006-11-26T11:02:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Jim	what client are you using?
2006-11-26T11:03:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Jim	yes, it will. Use irssi (a text-based IRC client). It should already be installed, but if it isn't, sudo apt-get install irssi should get it for you.
2006-11-26T11:04:00.000Z	Jim	fyrestrtr	well that was all I needed, thank you very much for your help
2006-11-26T11:04:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Jim	then type 'irssi' to start it up, type /con irc.freenode.net to connect to freenode, and /j #ubuntu to get back in here.
2006-11-26T11:04:00.000Z	Jim	fyrestrtr	okay
2006-11-26T11:05:00.000Z	Jim	fyrestrtr	one second
2006-11-26T11:06:00.000Z	Jim	fyrestrtr	can I use that command to get other packages too?
2006-11-26T11:10:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Jim	the wiki has great stuff if you are new to ubuntu. I suggest you browse it.
