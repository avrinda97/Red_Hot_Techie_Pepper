2007-02-15T15:01:00.000Z	starz		but i figured start with config for the x.x.17.x and use that for the next one lol
2007-02-15T15:01:00.000Z	starz		im sure it will panic XD
2007-02-15T15:01:00.000Z	starz		yeah
2007-02-15T15:02:00.000Z	starz		thats my hope mwe
2007-02-15T15:02:00.000Z	starz		heh
2007-02-15T15:02:00.000Z	starz		what about patching it for ubuntu?
2007-02-15T15:02:00.000Z	starz		actually
2007-02-15T15:02:00.000Z	starz		what about using the feisty .20
2007-02-15T15:02:00.000Z	starz		right
2007-02-15T15:03:00.000Z	starz		do you have dns setup in ipv6 nanothief?
2007-02-15T15:03:00.000Z	unop	starz	 have you tried installing the .deb from feisty?
2007-02-15T15:13:00.000Z	unop	starz	 women and children frequent this room - it's easier not to be a little considerate and not swear in their presence - and everyone is happy if you dont :)
2007-02-15T15:14:00.000Z	starz	unop	there has been a rather large movement for quite a few centuries which got popularized in the last few decades called womens rights.. going for equality... its not that chivalry is dead its that women killed it.
2007-02-15T15:15:00.000Z	unop	starz	 thats not the point, how do you know how old everyone is thats watching your posts? eh?
2007-02-15T15:16:00.000Z	unop	starz	 no, you used another four-letter word thats worse
2007-02-15T15:22:00.000Z	starz	unop	im thinking your right.. or an offchance its a hardware error... but sounds like its got to have a ipv6 dns server as main dns no?
2007-02-15T15:23:00.000Z	unop	starz	 that or worse, the DNS server looks up IPv6 and is also a forwarder which forwards the queries on to a list of similar others
2007-02-15T15:24:00.000Z	starz	unop	mm didnt htink of that tho i considered that perhaps the same dns server does ipv4 and 6?
2007-02-15T15:30:00.000Z	starz	unop	its not gonna work
2007-02-15T15:31:00.000Z	unop	starz	 well, then there's no way recursing is going to happen
2007-02-15T15:31:00.000Z	starz	unop	agreed.
