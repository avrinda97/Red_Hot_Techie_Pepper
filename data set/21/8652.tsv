2006-02-23T14:49:00.000Z	_jason	jace	what are you looking for?
2006-02-23T14:50:00.000Z	jace	_jason	I just wanna be able to play videos in mozilla, I've downloaded so many video players with synaptic.  But still nothing.
2006-02-23T14:50:00.000Z	_jason	jace	have you tried mplayer and mplayer plugin?
2006-02-23T14:51:00.000Z	_jason	jace	mozilla-mplayer, you probably want w32codecs as well, do you know how to get those?
2006-02-23T14:52:00.000Z	_jason	jace	you can get mozilla-mplayer from synaptic.  I will have the bot tell you about w32codecs
2006-02-23T14:53:00.000Z	_jason	jace	what do you mean?
2006-02-23T14:53:00.000Z	_jason	jace	yes, that means you won't be able to use w32codecs
2006-02-23T14:55:00.000Z	_jason	jace	there are two options that I know of, chroot and comoiling vlc with support for wmv
2006-02-23T14:57:00.000Z	_jason	jace	yep
2006-02-23T14:57:00.000Z	jace	_jason	how difficult is that?  I think you said you've never done it before?
2006-02-23T14:58:00.000Z	_jason	jace	nope, never done it
2006-02-23T14:58:00.000Z	jace	_jason	any idea where I could find a help page on how to do it?  I'm reading into it right now and it says it's done by using a linux vserver
2006-02-23T14:58:00.000Z	_jason	jace	I've seen a guide on the forum, you can try the wiki too.  ubuntuforums.org wiki.ubuntu.com
2006-02-23T15:11:00.000Z	jace	_jason	thanks for the help jason
