2008-02-16T20:57:00.000Z	thrope		member:dsnyders: you could look at unison, it has some clever merging/diffing on files and directories...http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/
2008-02-16T20:59:00.000Z	dsnyders	thrope	/me googles for unison...
2008-02-16T21:21:00.000Z	dsnyders	thrope	unison might be what I'm looking for.  Is it possible to set it to transfer one way only?
2008-02-16T21:22:00.000Z	thrope	dsnyders	I'm not sure, but i wouldnt have thought it matters, if you do your directories pairwise, ie unison the first two and resolve conflicts until they're both the same, then just delete one... repeat for others
2008-02-16T21:23:00.000Z	thrope	dsnyders	there might be some options for doing it one way though - its pretty configurable
2008-02-16T21:24:00.000Z	dsnyders	thrope	the problem with that approach is that there may be files that are different in the two directories (and possible space issues on the drive).  I want to preserve the differences.
2008-02-16T21:26:00.000Z	dsnyders	thrope	It's a good thought though.
2008-02-16T21:28:00.000Z	thrope	dsnyders	sorry check above - got your nick wrong
2008-02-16T21:29:00.000Z	thrope	dsnyders	if you have 2 different files with the same name in different dirs and you want to preserve them both you will have to rename or something anyway, so i think unison gives you the chance
2008-02-16T21:29:00.000Z	thrope	dsnyders	to be honest im not sure, but for the comparing files, subdirs etc. intelligently unison is the best hing i think, although i agree its not designed to do exactly what you want
2008-02-16T21:30:00.000Z	dsnyders	thrope	If there are 2 different files with the same name, I want them skipped.
2008-02-16T21:31:00.000Z	dsnyders	thrope	unison seems to be the best tool anyone has suggested, so far.  So ten geek points for you!
2008-02-16T21:31:00.000Z	thrope	dsnyders	you'd have to do that yourself, unison would flag the conflict, then you move the second one to one side, let the sync finish, delete the copy you don't wont, recreate the directory with the appropriate name and put back the file you wanted left there
2008-02-16T21:32:00.000Z	thrope	dsnyders	thanks :)
2008-02-16T21:32:00.000Z	dsnyders	thrope	I think what I'll do is email the unison folks with exactly what I want to do, and see what they have to say.
2008-02-16T21:34:00.000Z	thrope	dsnyders	i dont think youll find them too responsive... there is a mailing list (yahoo) i think, but pretty low volume... worth a try but I reckon you're better playing with it a bit to see what you can do - and perhaps relaxing your requirements that conflict files are left in place (couldn't they just be moved somewhere else and labelled appropriately)... good luck though
2008-02-16T21:37:00.000Z	dsnyders	thrope	I'll give that some thought.  It just seemed that it would be easy to compare two directories, eliminate the duplicate files, and move the unique files.  I mean, it sound like a four line script... If one knew how to write scripts.
2008-02-16T21:42:00.000Z	thrope	dsnyders	yeah when you put it like that it should be pretty easy...
2008-02-16T21:45:00.000Z	dsnyders	thrope	I'm convinced that it is that easy.  Unfortunately, I don't know how to write scripts.
2008-02-16T21:47:00.000Z	thrope	dsnyders	i'll have a quick go this afternoon if you like
2008-02-16T21:50:00.000Z	dsnyders	thrope	thanks.  You've done enough already.
