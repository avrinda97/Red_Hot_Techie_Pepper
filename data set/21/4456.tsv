2008-07-15T05:30:00.000Z	timsandtoms		Can I use an Ubuntu LiveCD to access my windows partition? I broke GRUB, I just need to get on and get my Firefox bookmarks, then I'll just reformat(Easier then fixin, and I wanna change the partition sizes anyways :P)
2008-07-15T05:30:00.000Z	Mecha25	timsandtoms	yes, but it's read only
2008-07-15T05:30:00.000Z	timsandtoms	Mecha25	Thats fine :D I just need to pull my bookmarks out. How do I go about doing it?
2008-07-15T05:31:00.000Z	Mecha25	timsandtoms	I assume you're using the live cd now?
2008-07-15T05:31:00.000Z	Mecha25	timsandtoms	once it's loaded, your windows partition should appear as an icon on your desktop
2008-07-15T05:32:00.000Z	timsandtoms	Mecha25	And if it doesn't? It never has before... It's not an OEM version of XP, it's some Emachines version, doesn't always act normal
2008-07-15T05:32:00.000Z	Mecha25	timsandtoms	you can try mounting it, there's a command
2008-07-15T05:34:00.000Z	Mecha25	timsandtoms	look in /mnt, there should be a bunch of folders in there, you want either hda or sda, or possibly hdb or sdb.  Anyone know which?  you'll know it because the right one will give you the contents of the drive you want
2008-07-15T05:34:00.000Z	timsandtoms	Mecha25	Alright, thanks, I'll try that, brb
2008-07-15T05:35:00.000Z	Mecha25	timsandtoms	scratch that, look in /media
2008-07-15T05:35:00.000Z	timsandtoms	Mecha25	Ok, will do :P
2008-07-15T05:41:00.000Z	timsandtoms	Mecha25	Actually, just found it in Computer under Places xD Figures, it had to be easy. Any idea where windows stores the firefox bookmarks?
2008-07-15T05:41:00.000Z	Mecha25	timsandtoms	one sec, I can give you an exact path
2008-07-15T05:43:00.000Z	Mecha25	timsandtoms	sorry, what version of windows and firefox are you running?
2008-07-15T05:44:00.000Z	Mecha25	timsandtoms	it'll depend on that
2008-07-15T05:44:00.000Z	timsandtoms	Mecha25	WinXP SP2, Firefox 2something
2008-07-15T05:44:00.000Z	Mecha25	timsandtoms	great, I'm running Firefox3 on vista... this could be tough
2008-07-15T05:44:00.000Z	Mecha25	timsandtoms	you might google "firefox 2 windows XP bookmark location" and see if you can find anything
2008-07-15T05:45:00.000Z	timsandtoms	Mecha25	Ah, ok, will do :) Thanks for the help
2008-07-15T05:46:00.000Z	timsandtoms	Mecha25	Ok, got it :D Thanks!
2008-07-15T05:46:00.000Z	Mecha25	timsandtoms	no problem
