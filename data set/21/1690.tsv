2010-05-28T22:33:00.000Z	coz_	gicaprazzz	 oh darn let me see if that is because of something reported  I heard  hold on
2010-05-28T22:35:00.000Z	coz_	gicaprazzz	  did this start happening after installing lucid  or after lucid updates?
2010-05-28T22:37:00.000Z	gicaprazzz	coz_	let's say after lucid updates. yesterday it worked fine.
2010-05-28T22:37:00.000Z	coz_	gicaprazzz	 ok what have you done so far for troubleshooting including reboot ?
2010-05-28T22:38:00.000Z	gicaprazzz	coz_	rebooted several times, booted with an older kernel image and initrd. none solved the problem.
2010-05-28T22:39:00.000Z	coz_	gicaprazzz	 and wise_crypt  let me try to find the report on this... a change was made by ubuntu to not allow composite on certain intel stuff  hold on
2010-05-28T22:46:00.000Z	coz_	gicaprazzz	 the only thing I can think of is the "block" put on some intel video chips to prevent effects especially compiz from working   I dont know of a fix other than going back to karmic  which I am about to do myself  because of 3 major bugs.... other than that   I dont have any other troubleshooting procedures to offer
2010-05-28T22:47:00.000Z	coz_	gicaprazzz	I also cannto find the bug report on this even asked the fellow who made the changes to ubuntu
2010-05-28T22:48:00.000Z	gicaprazzz	coz_	could you tell me how to "unblacklist" it, at least?
2010-05-28T22:49:00.000Z	coz_	gicaprazzz	 sorry about that I hit the wrong button
2010-05-28T22:51:00.000Z	gicaprazzz	coz_	np. is there any way to roll back updates?
2010-05-28T22:51:00.000Z	coz_	gicaprazzz	 ah good question...  I dont use apptitude at all but I believe via aptitude you can do this... i know there are people here more qulaified to answer that question ..
