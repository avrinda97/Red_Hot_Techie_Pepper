2008-11-12T21:45:00.000Z	Yimpolo	DIL_	Are you trying to network them together using Windows Workgroups?
2008-11-12T21:46:00.000Z	DIL_	Yimpolo	before it was showing under MSHOME modified smb.conf to show domain then disappaered however it does show when connected wireless
2008-11-12T21:47:00.000Z	Yimpolo	DIL_	Have you manually added the workgroup into smb.conf? (ie: workgroup = HOME)
2008-11-12T21:48:00.000Z	DIL_	Yimpolo	yes
2008-11-12T21:48:00.000Z	Yimpolo	DIL_	Hmmm...
2008-11-12T21:49:00.000Z	DIL_	Yimpolo	yes i gets i will keep it connected wirelss until i stumble onto what i may have done probably something obvious
2008-11-12T21:50:00.000Z	Yimpolo	DIL_	Yeah that's kinda odd... Is your smb.conf file different when you connect wireless vs. wired?
2008-11-12T21:50:00.000Z	DIL_	Yimpolo	not sure how would i determine that
2008-11-12T21:51:00.000Z	Yimpolo	DIL_	Well. Connect wirelessly, note the workgroup name. Then connect via Ethernet and then compare the workgroup names.
2008-11-12T21:51:00.000Z	DIL_	Yimpolo	willtry
2008-11-12T21:54:00.000Z	DIL_	Yimpolo	thanks for your time it is the same
2008-11-12T21:55:00.000Z	Yimpolo	DIL_	So the conf file doesn't change at all
2008-11-12T21:55:00.000Z	DIL_	Yimpolo	nope
2008-11-12T21:56:00.000Z	Yimpolo	DIL_	One other question. Is your wireless subnet different than your ethernet subnet?
2008-11-12T21:56:00.000Z	Yimpolo	DIL_	Check the "hosts allow" portion to see if all the correct subnets are defined.
2008-11-12T21:57:00.000Z	DIL_	Yimpolo	will check
2008-11-12T21:57:00.000Z	Yimpolo	DIL_	thx
2008-11-12T21:57:00.000Z	Yimpolo	DIL_	That's about my ideas for that... not sure what else to say
2008-11-12T21:58:00.000Z	DIL_	Yimpolo	thanks appreciate your help
2008-11-12T22:07:00.000Z	DIL_	Yimpolo	must have been a hiccup shut down and the networked computers came up thanks again
