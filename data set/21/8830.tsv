2010-02-21T19:59:00.000Z	ori_		can someone help me read dvds on my computer? i put them in, and nothing happens
2010-02-21T20:00:00.000Z	IdleOne	ori_	have you installed the ubuntu-restricted-extras package?
2010-02-21T21:08:00.000Z	IdleOne	ori_	sudo apt-get install libdvdnav4 libdvdread4 gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly
2010-02-21T21:08:00.000Z	IdleOne	ori_	as you can see you can put in multiple package names and apt will hopefully install them all without errors
2010-02-21T21:09:00.000Z	IdleOne	ori_	and it is?
2010-02-21T21:09:00.000Z	IdleOne	ori_	that is why we are here :)
2010-02-21T21:13:00.000Z	IdleOne	ori_	no output from that command?
2010-02-21T21:14:00.000Z	IdleOne	ori_	ok, well let it finish doing what it is doing
2010-02-21T21:16:00.000Z	IdleOne	ori_	ok so now in terminal you should be back at the prompt
2010-02-21T21:16:00.000Z	IdleOne	ori_	alright pop in a dvd and cross your toes :)
2010-02-21T21:18:00.000Z	IdleOne	ori_	what app are you using to view the dvd?
2010-02-21T21:19:00.000Z	IdleOne	ori_	let me check something in vlc, I remember I had to change a setting to get dvd to work for me
2010-02-21T21:20:00.000Z	IdleOne	ori_	open VLC, click on Tools > Preferences then on the left hand side pane click on Video. What is in the Output box?
2010-02-21T21:22:00.000Z	IdleOne	ori_	change it to X11 video output, click save and try the dvd again
2010-02-21T21:23:00.000Z	IdleOne	ori_	so when you put a dvd in the drive it does not load automatically?
2010-02-21T21:24:00.000Z	IdleOne	ori_	thaqt is a whole other issue then and I don't know how to help with that but it is a IMPORTANT piece of info to share with us :)
2010-02-21T21:25:00.000Z	IdleOne	ori_	well rephrase your question and include that the dvd drive is not being recognised
2010-02-21T21:25:00.000Z	IdleOne	ori_	no problem
2010-02-21T21:25:00.000Z	IdleOne	ori_	Well we can hope
2010-02-21T21:26:00.000Z	IdleOne	ori_	but you have all the apps and libs you need now to play dvd.
2010-02-21T21:28:00.000Z	IdleOne	ori_	this is going to sound like a strange question but you are certain that the drive is a DVD drive ?
