2010-08-04T00:27:00.000Z	zdravi	rhodan	quick question. wpa_supplicant wants a driver, the default is wext. Is there an easy way to check which kind I have?
2010-08-04T00:28:00.000Z	rhodan	zdravi	lspci | grep -i wireless
2010-08-04T00:28:00.000Z	zdravi	rhodan	I tried, but it doesn't seem to be working. I'm in the odd position of having Network Manager work, but wpa_supplicant doesn't seem to be.
2010-08-04T00:29:00.000Z	rhodan	zdravi	You stopped networkmanager for real?
2010-08-04T00:30:00.000Z	zdravi	rhodan	It's running atm, or I wouldn't be on IRC. wpa_supplicant doesn't work even when I don't have Network Manager running, though (trying to get wireless up and running without having to start gdm/X up)
2010-08-04T00:30:00.000Z	rhodan	zdravi	You can have NM without X, too.
2010-08-04T00:31:00.000Z	zdravi	rhodan	That may be a heck of a lot easier. What's the cli command?
2010-08-04T00:31:00.000Z	rhodan	zdravi	None. Just start X and open the network settings.
2010-08-04T00:32:00.000Z	zdravi	rhodan	That's what I'm trying to avoid. I want to be able to do everything without X to conserve battery life, and Network Manager is the only thing getting in the way.
2010-08-04T00:39:00.000Z	zdravi	rhodan	any other thoughts on wpa_supplicant not working? It's a broadcom on an hp netbook, if that helps.
2010-08-04T00:40:00.000Z	rhodan	zdravi	ifconfig -a says what?
2010-08-04T00:41:00.000Z	zdravi	rhodan	eth1 is my wireless, which bit of info do you want
2010-08-04T00:41:00.000Z	rhodan	zdravi	can you do iwlist eth1 scan?
2010-08-04T00:41:00.000Z	zdravi	rhodan	Yes
2010-08-04T01:10:00.000Z	rhodan	zdravi	I would zero out the first few MBs.
2010-08-04T01:10:00.000Z	zdravi	rhodan	If it's complaining about sda6, it sounds like if it's a HW error it's later in the drive. And Zeus__, np :3
2010-08-04T01:28:00.000Z	rhodan	zdravi	We would have lost him.
2010-08-04T01:28:00.000Z	zdravi	rhodan	I assumed he was on another computer, since he's talking to us while booting his computer around ><
2010-08-04T01:33:00.000Z	rhodan	zdravi	You made that up.
2010-08-04T01:33:00.000Z	zdravi	rhodan	nope :x
2010-08-04T01:34:00.000Z	zdravi	rhodan	If the head is on the platter you've got a crash and you're pretty much already fucked ><
