2009-03-20T11:23:00.000Z	hateball	BePhantom	Places - Connect to Network share, I believe.... Not on English Ubuntu so not sure about the proper translation
2009-03-20T11:24:00.000Z	BePhantom	hateball	already tried that, it says it cant mount it
2009-03-20T11:24:00.000Z	hateball	BePhantom	Hmm, should just work... but perhaps you have to install smbfs first. Open a terminal and type "sudo apt-get install smbfs"
2009-03-20T11:25:00.000Z	BePhantom		ok, doing that right now hateball
2009-03-20T11:26:00.000Z	hateball	BePhantom	You can also access samba shares from Nautilus by entering "smbfs://ip.to.server/share" in the adress field
2009-03-20T11:27:00.000Z	BePhantom		after sudo apt-get install smbfs should i be able to use Places - Connect to Network share hateball?
2009-03-20T11:27:00.000Z	hateball	BePhantom	yeah that should work, as well as what I typed about nautilus
2009-03-20T11:28:00.000Z	BePhantom		is nautilus the default file brower in 8.10?
2009-03-20T11:28:00.000Z	BePhantom		browser
2009-03-20T11:29:00.000Z	BePhantom		cool
2009-03-20T11:30:00.000Z	BePhantom		the file is downloading so it may take time since im downloading another thing
2009-03-20T11:30:00.000Z	BePhantom		in the meanwhile i have another question about flash
2009-03-20T11:30:00.000Z	BePhantom		cant make youtube work, i already installed the flash plugin
2009-03-20T11:30:00.000Z	BePhantom		from FF
2009-03-20T11:31:00.000Z	BePhantom		cant make youtube work, i already installed the flash plugin from firefox. Any hints?
2009-03-20T11:32:00.000Z	hateball	BePhantom	Make sure you dont have different plugins installed at a time, like swfdec and Adobe flash. Use one or the other
2009-03-20T11:33:00.000Z	BePhantom	hateball	i may have installed flash from adobe home page, i installed the .deb file but it didnt work, then i tried downloading directly from FF, same result
2009-03-20T11:34:00.000Z	hateball	BePhantom	The deb file from Adobe doesnt work.  open a terminal and "sudo apt-get remove swfdec-mozilla gnash" && "sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree"
2009-03-20T11:35:00.000Z	hateball	BePhantom	make sure to close/restart Firefox while doing so
2009-03-20T11:36:00.000Z	BePhantom	hateball	ok
2009-03-20T11:41:00.000Z	BePhantom	hateball	smbfs finished installing, i go to places and try to connect but i keep getting the same error, something about there's no registered application
