2007-06-23T15:36:00.000Z	hangthedj	vecina	find the real libncurses.so file and then create a link to libncurses.so.5 using the main file.
2007-06-23T15:36:00.000Z	vecina	hangthedj	okay, ill do a search
2007-06-23T15:40:00.000Z	vecina	hangthedj	I found the file with a search... what do i do with it though? and by the way there's like 3... libncurses.so.5.5, libncurses.so.5, and another libncurses.so.5
2007-06-23T15:42:00.000Z	hangthedj	vecina	what directory are they in? and what are you trying to build.
2007-06-23T15:43:00.000Z	vecina	hangthedj	im not trying to build anything. i installed peerguardian, and its saying that libncurses.so.5 cannot be found
2007-06-23T15:45:00.000Z	vecina	hangthedj	put it in the peerguardian path? as in copy it to the same directory?
2007-06-23T15:45:00.000Z	vecina	hangthedj	Im so confused >.< i just wanna block aggressive ips here
2007-06-23T15:47:00.000Z	vecina	hangthedj	heh, that caused a segmentation fault
2007-06-23T15:48:00.000Z	vecina	hangthedj	I still say the deb package's i368 label may be to blame, seeing as im in a 64 bit platform here
2007-06-23T15:51:00.000Z	hangthedj	vecina	peerguardian is working for me. have you tried moblock?
2007-06-23T15:52:00.000Z	vecina	hangthedj	yes, and it installs, but its log file is totally static.
2007-06-23T15:52:00.000Z	vecina	hangthedj	i dont really know if its actually doing anything
2007-06-23T15:54:00.000Z	hangthedj	vecina	check /etc/moblock/guarding.p2p or check the cron jobs.
2007-06-23T15:54:00.000Z	vecina	hangthedj	WOAH.  /etc/moblock/guarding.p2p has oen big list
2007-06-23T15:55:00.000Z	vecina	hangthedj	if i try to ping one of these, i should be blocked right?
2007-06-23T15:55:00.000Z	hangthedj	vecina	not sure, all i know is you block them. but it sounds reasonable that it would be blocked.
2007-06-23T15:56:00.000Z	vecina	hangthedj	so... moblock is working then? :/
2007-06-23T15:56:00.000Z	hangthedj	vecina	sounds like it :)
2007-06-23T15:57:00.000Z	vecina	hangthedj	I really hope so...
2007-06-23T15:59:00.000Z	hangthedj	vecina	look for moblock in /etc/cron.daily
2007-06-23T16:00:00.000Z	vecina	hangthedj	Thanks! :3
