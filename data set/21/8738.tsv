2006-02-20T10:50:00.000Z	Eleaf		does anybody want to help me get video out working on my iBook?
2006-02-20T10:50:00.000Z	Eleaf		I have a huge presentation tomorrow
2006-02-20T10:50:00.000Z	Eleaf		I need to present it on a projector
2006-02-20T10:50:00.000Z	Eleaf		This is worth 50% of my final term grade.
2006-02-20T10:50:00.000Z	Eleaf		mmm
2006-02-20T10:51:00.000Z	ulrik	Eleaf	it could be hard. I have an ibook, but I've never tried, so I'm not much help :(
2006-02-20T10:51:00.000Z	Eleaf	ulrik	mmmm
2006-02-20T10:52:00.000Z	ulrik	Eleaf	it could be the ati radeon Mobility M9/9200 something
2006-02-20T10:52:00.000Z	Eleaf	ulrik	it's older than that
2006-02-20T10:53:00.000Z	ulrik	Eleaf	Hate to say it, but to make oneself depend on that you get this to work the night before is quite bad planning
2006-02-20T10:54:00.000Z	Eleaf	ulrik	I've been trying to get it to work for months actually.
2006-02-20T10:54:00.000Z	ulrik	Eleaf	but look on the forums... it should be able to get it to work so that _only_ the external monitor works and not the internal one
2006-02-20T10:54:00.000Z	ulrik	Eleaf	try that if everything else fails
2006-02-20T10:54:00.000Z	Eleaf	ulrik	I looked there.  It's only for the newer iBooks.  All the posts are years old too.
2006-02-20T10:55:00.000Z	Eleaf	ulrik	I would be soo happy if only the external one worked...
2006-02-20T10:55:00.000Z	ulrik	Eleaf	then try (something I read about, never tried).. start it plugged-in and close the lid soon after
2006-02-20T10:55:00.000Z	ulrik	Eleaf	that could enable just the external monitor
2006-02-20T10:55:00.000Z	ulrik	Eleaf	but it could also just not work
2006-02-20T10:55:00.000Z	Eleaf	ulrik	hmm...  that enables sleep, which makes the computer unusable
2006-02-20T10:56:00.000Z	ulrik	Eleaf	sure? Not with external things
2006-02-20T10:56:00.000Z	Eleaf	ulrik	I don't think it detects the external monitor
