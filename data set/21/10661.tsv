2004-12-31T16:48:00.000Z	noob		would i always have to boot with a floppy now, or it will create a new boot record like before?
2004-12-31T16:49:00.000Z	noob		ok, can you point me where i could find a boot disk
2004-12-31T16:50:00.000Z	noob		and ill try to find out how to re-create my boot record
2004-12-31T16:50:00.000Z	neighborlee	noob	you dont need boot disk
2004-12-31T16:50:00.000Z	neighborlee	noob	at least you shouldn't..just boot with livecd and use 'rescue' mode
2004-12-31T16:50:00.000Z	neighborlee	noob	once there you re-run lilo and install it to your harddrive MBR
2004-12-31T16:51:00.000Z	neighborlee	noob	okay grub then LOL
2004-12-31T16:52:00.000Z	neighborlee	noob	then you do not want livecd
2004-12-31T16:53:00.000Z	neighborlee	noob	unless you want to show off ubuntu to friend then by all means!!
2004-12-31T16:53:00.000Z	neighborlee	noob	special cd that runs from cd and doesn't require installation
2004-12-31T16:53:00.000Z	neighborlee	noob	not recommended but for on the move and showing off to converts <G>
2004-12-31T16:53:00.000Z	neighborlee	noob	no biggie
2004-12-31T16:55:00.000Z	neighborlee	noob	I've done it before but with FC cd
2004-12-31T16:56:00.000Z	neighborlee	noob	knooppix may work dunno...but I know FC cd works by going into whats called 'rescue mode'
2004-12-31T16:57:00.000Z	neighborlee	noob	for that you only need disk#1 of FC..as I say knoppix may do it I dont know...but I know FC does...
2004-12-31T16:58:00.000Z	neighborlee	noob	http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/core/3/i386/iso/ < go there and get : FC3-i386-disc1.iso   and burn it to a cd..reboot and go into rescue mode and then run: grub-install hda ( if wrong someone correct me)
2004-12-31T16:59:00.000Z	noob	neighborlee	ok ! ill check this out
