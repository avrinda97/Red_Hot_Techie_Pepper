2007-10-10T12:23:00.000Z	Konam		???
2007-10-10T12:23:00.000Z	Pici	Konam	sudo invoke-rc.d gdm stop
2007-10-31T18:25:00.000Z	Konam	Pici	I'm not saying is an ubuntu bug
2007-10-31T18:26:00.000Z	Konam	Pici	and we still don't know who is causing this exactly
2007-10-31T18:26:00.000Z	Pici	Konam	okay, well, there is more information in the links there that can help you see if you are effected by it.
2007-12-18T21:26:00.000Z	Pici	Konam	nfs-common I believe.
2007-12-18T23:29:00.000Z	Pici	Konam	fyi, most likely your client doesnt know what matrix is, either put an entry in /etc/hosts or specify the ipaddress
2007-12-18T23:30:00.000Z	Pici	Konam	ifconfig
2007-12-18T23:31:00.000Z	Konam	Pici	the inet addr?
2007-12-18T23:31:00.000Z	Pici	Konam	Yes.
2007-12-18T23:31:00.000Z	Konam	Pici	i've already tried mounting that ip addres and it didn't work
2007-12-18T23:33:00.000Z	Konam	Pici	i get this: mount.nfs: mount to NFS server '192.168.1.101' failed: timed out, retrying
2007-12-18T23:33:00.000Z	Pici	Konam	I don't have the knowledge to help you past this, sorry :/
2007-12-19T23:23:00.000Z	Pici	Konam	Because those programs can break your system.
2007-12-19T23:24:00.000Z	Pici	Konam	And many people have come here seeking help with their broken systems.
2007-12-19T23:25:00.000Z	Pici	Konam	#ubuntu-offtopic please.
2007-12-19T23:25:00.000Z	Konam	Pici	ikonia calm down, that was just a comment
2007-12-19T23:26:00.000Z	Pici	Konam	We'd be more than happy to explain why we dont support those things in #ubuntu-offtopic, just not here.
2007-12-19T23:28:00.000Z	Konam	Pici	I know why you don't and i understand that stand is just that you (canonical, ubuntu members) demean some of those projects, there's no need of it, time ago they were useful and needed, they deserve some respect at least
2007-12-19T23:29:00.000Z	Pici	Konam	Please, join me in #ubuntu-offtopic
