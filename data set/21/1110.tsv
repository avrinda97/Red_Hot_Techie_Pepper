2012-09-16T19:09:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Mtn_Bkng_Dave	there is no context though
2012-09-16T19:23:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Mtn_Bkng_Dave	use a paste site next time
2012-09-16T19:24:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Mtn_Bkng_Dave	you are being vague again
2012-09-16T19:25:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Mtn_Bkng_Dave	and what nvidia driver are you using?
2012-09-16T19:28:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Mtn_Bkng_Dave	open nvidia settings to get the version
2012-09-16T19:28:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Mtn_Bkng_Dave	gksudo nvidia-settings in a terminal
2012-09-16T19:30:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Mtn_Bkng_Dave	173? is this an old nvidia card?
2012-09-16T19:32:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Mtn_Bkng_Dave	what kernel are you on? uname -a
2012-09-16T19:33:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Mtn_Bkng_Dave	hmm, i'm not sure what to suggest then, sorry
2012-09-16T19:35:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Mtn_Bkng_Dave	you could try out the nouveau driver, see if that has problems
2012-09-16T19:56:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Mtn_Bkng_Dave	if you are pasting multiple lines please use a paste site
