2008-11-19T23:43:00.000Z	mwhit74		just installed amarok the music player and now i can't get music to play any suggestions
2008-11-19T23:43:00.000Z	s0l1dsnak3123	mwhit74	have you scanned for music?
2008-11-19T23:45:00.000Z	s0l1dsnak3123	mwhit74	I'm not sure what to suggest except searching google, sorry :S
2008-11-19T23:46:00.000Z	mwhit74	s0l1dsnak3123	ok it works now, after i loaded rythmbox music player but i dont understand why
2008-11-19T23:46:00.000Z	s0l1dsnak3123	mwhit74	that is odd, perhaps pulseaudio issues
2008-11-19T23:48:00.000Z	mwhit74	s0l1dsnak3123	first what are pulseaudio issues second do you think if i uninstall it, it will fix it
2008-11-19T23:49:00.000Z	s0l1dsnak3123	mwhit74	pulseaudio is a technology that allows you to control volumes independantly of programs
2008-11-19T23:50:00.000Z	s0l1dsnak3123	mwhit74	for example if i wanted flash to be quiet, and my music to be loud, i could set them independantly
2008-11-19T23:50:00.000Z	mwhit74	s0l1dsnak3123	oh i guess that makes sense
2008-11-19T23:50:00.000Z	mwhit74	s0l1dsnak3123	yea i get kinda how it would work, so uninstalling could be a solution
2008-11-19T23:51:00.000Z	s0l1dsnak3123	mwhit74	however, uninstalling isn't an option because its hard to configure alsa to work (alsa is the old way)
2008-11-19T23:52:00.000Z	mwhit74	s0l1dsnak3123	its not an option because why
2008-11-19T23:53:00.000Z	s0l1dsnak3123	mwhit74	it isn't really worth the hassle, as stuff will work :)
2008-11-19T23:53:00.000Z	mwhit74	s0l1dsnak3123	ok thanks for the help
2008-11-19T23:54:00.000Z	s0l1dsnak3123	mwhit74	no problem
2008-11-19T23:54:00.000Z	mwhit74	s0l1dsnak3123	ps do you know of a program like peer guardian but for ubuntu
2008-11-19T23:54:00.000Z	s0l1dsnak3123	mwhit74	i believe peerguardian has a client for linux
2008-11-19T23:55:00.000Z	mwhit74	s0l1dsnak3123	i have heard of moblock but its a lot of code and i dont have time to mess with it and i have also heard of ipblocker
2008-11-19T23:55:00.000Z	s0l1dsnak3123	mwhit74	i don't really have experience in that area im afraid
2008-11-19T23:55:00.000Z	mwhit74	s0l1dsnak3123	i will have to look again because i didn't think there was
2008-11-19T23:55:00.000Z	mwhit74	s0l1dsnak3123	ok thanks again
