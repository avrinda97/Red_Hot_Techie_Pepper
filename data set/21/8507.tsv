2007-07-29T15:58:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	bill	the line is called 'default' it will be something like this > default 0
2007-07-29T15:58:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	bill	0 is the first entry called 'title', so the second entry is called 1, and the third entry 2, etc.
2007-07-29T15:59:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	bill	find the entry that has the os you want for default, and change the 0 after default 0 to that number, save the file, and reboot.
2007-07-30T16:05:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	bill	*NO*
2007-07-30T16:05:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	bill	like I said, where it says, on a line by itself default 0
2007-07-30T16:06:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	bill	no, keep looking.
2007-07-30T16:06:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	bill	it is on a line by itself.it is the first line at the very top that doesn't have a # before it.
2007-07-30T16:07:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	bill	stop.
2007-07-30T16:07:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	bill	please listen. This is not complicated.
2007-07-30T16:08:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	bill	it is the very first line, from the top that DOES NOT HAVE A #
2007-07-30T16:08:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	bill	by # I mean the symbol '#'
