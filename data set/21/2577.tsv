2009-11-08T04:47:00.000Z	Billiard	mycomputer	if you comment out the lines in your /etc/network/interfaces file the network-manager should let you configure it
2009-11-08T04:48:00.000Z	mycomputer	Billiard	i cant able to understand please tell clearly i am not that much familiar
2009-11-08T04:49:00.000Z	Billiard	mycomputer	you said the network manager says "device not managed"
2009-11-08T04:50:00.000Z	Billiard	mycomputer	edit your /etc/network/interfaces file put # in front of the lines that deal with your dsl connection
2009-11-08T04:51:00.000Z	mycomputer	Billiard	where i want to put # weather every line
2009-11-08T04:51:00.000Z	Billiard	mycomputer	the lines that are for your dsl connection, probably 2 lines
2009-11-08T04:53:00.000Z	mycomputer	Billiard	if i change it is not showing the option save
2009-11-08T04:53:00.000Z	Billiard	mycomputer	use `gksudo gedit /etc/network/interfaces` to edit the file
