2006-05-27T05:57:00.000Z	leojstewart	dooglus	they promise to support support other formats soon, though
2006-05-27T05:59:00.000Z	dooglus	leojstewart	"DRM" covers a bunch of different systems.  there may be hacks for some of them, but not all.
2006-05-27T05:59:00.000Z	leojstewart	dooglus	I don't think I quite understand how DRM works :P
2006-05-27T06:00:00.000Z	dooglus	leojstewart	it's just encryption.  see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management for more info
2006-05-27T06:01:00.000Z	leojstewart	dooglus	thanks for the link - will give it a read.
2006-05-27T06:02:00.000Z	dooglus	leojstewart	probably the most famous type of DRM is on DVDs.  Most commercial DVDs are encrypted, and can't be played by open source DVD players without using some questionable code that breaks the encryption
2006-05-27T06:04:00.000Z	leojstewart	dooglus	I see.  Well, I tried to download a 'highlight' reel from a recent game on MediaZone.  I think it was encrypted with DRM like their full releases, because the sound wouldn't play, and the screen was completely unreadable.
2006-05-27T06:04:00.000Z	leojstewart	dooglus	is there no way to get past something like that?
2006-05-27T06:05:00.000Z	dooglus	leojstewart	past what?  it's illegal (in the US) to decrypt DVDs without a license to do so.  Whether it's technically possible or not doesn't matter - it's illegal.
2006-05-27T06:06:00.000Z	leojstewart	dooglus	well, it's not a DVD.  But it uses the same type of encryption, I think.  Sorry if I'm misunderstanding, but is there some way, illegal or not, to decrypt the protection on this downloaded video?
2006-05-27T06:07:00.000Z	leojstewart	dooglus	the video I'm referring to is here: http://download1.mediazone.com/media/downloads/rugby/previewhighlights/2006/e-hl_3283.wmv
2006-05-27T06:07:00.000Z	leojstewart	dooglus	would you know how would go about finding the exact encryption of the movie?
2006-05-27T06:07:00.000Z	dooglus	leojstewart	the other great thing about US law is that even if I knew how to help you decrypt it, it's illegal for me to help you!  :)
2006-05-27T06:08:00.000Z	leojstewart	dooglus	heh, okay.
2006-05-27T06:08:00.000Z	dooglus	leojstewart	read all about the law: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act
2006-05-27T06:09:00.000Z	leojstewart	dooglus	reading (thanks for the link, again)
2006-05-27T06:11:00.000Z	dooglus	leojstewart	that's a windows media DRM file.  "Windows Media DRM is designed to be renewable, that is, it is designed on the assumption that it will be cracked and must be constantly updated by Microsoft. The result is that while the scheme has been cracked several times, it has usually not remained cracked for long."
2006-05-27T06:13:00.000Z	leojstewart	dooglus	thanks for the help :)
2006-05-27T06:14:00.000Z	leojstewart	dooglus	I'll see what I can do.
