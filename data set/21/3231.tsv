2010-10-25T09:46:00.000Z	bryhoyt	Jordan_U	yes, that's exactly what I want to do. But how do I bind that action to the power button???
2010-10-25T09:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bryhoyt	I see two possible goals, 1: Avoid the normal user prompt 2: Avoid the usual shutdown uglyness. Do you care about both or just the latter?
2010-10-25T09:49:00.000Z	bryhoyt	Jordan_U	2 is the most important. 1 I can solve via the Ubuntu power preferences, so it's not really a problem
2010-10-25T09:50:00.000Z	bryhoyt	Jordan_U	also, I want to make certain the box is actually shutoff. I don't want to come back after a 3 week holiday and find it's been hanging on something stupid like alsa-mixer-save (which can happen...)
2010-10-25T10:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bryhoyt	I want to say you should put a script in /etc/rc0.d/ but there is probably a better, upstart oriented, way to do it.
2010-10-25T10:04:00.000Z	bryhoyt	Jordan_U	yeah, and I tried a K00 script in /etc/rc0.d, but still get the messages. Surely there's SOMEONE who actually knows how Ubuntu 10.04 works...? I can't find anything to fix this on the internet. Tried /usr/lib/hal/scripts/*, /etc/acpi/*, /etc/acpi/events/* /etc/rc0.d/* and nothing actually does it
2010-10-25T10:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bryhoyt	What was in the script?
2010-10-25T10:05:00.000Z	bryhoyt		#!/bin/sh; poweroff -f
2010-10-25T10:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bryhoyt	echo o | /proc/sysrq-trigger
2010-10-25T10:09:00.000Z	bryhoyt	Jordan_U	just about tried it without thinking, then realized what it was ;-)
2010-10-25T10:09:00.000Z	bryhoyt		I know that poweroff -f works tho, so the actual command itself isn't an issue
2010-10-25T10:09:00.000Z	bryhoyt		but I'll try it anyway
2010-10-25T10:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bryhoyt	Ahh, you need update-rc.d.
2010-10-25T10:13:00.000Z	bryhoyt	Jordan_U	ok, what does that do?
2010-10-25T10:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bryhoyt	I'm still researching. You might want to ask in #upstart
2010-10-25T10:14:00.000Z	bryhoyt		thanks
2010-10-25T10:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bryhoyt	You're welcome.
2010-10-25T10:14:00.000Z	bryhoyt	Jordan_U	dinner time for me now, will look into it later. Appreciate your tips
2010-10-25T10:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bryhoyt	Ping me if you get anywhere.
2010-10-25T10:15:00.000Z	bryhoyt	Jordan_U	ok
