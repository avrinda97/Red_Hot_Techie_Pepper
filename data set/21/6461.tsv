2007-03-27T09:29:00.000Z	GolferX		is there a counselling channel on this network for support cause I don't want to go back to Windows
2007-03-27T09:30:00.000Z	neozen	GolferX	yes
2007-03-27T09:30:00.000Z	neozen	GolferX	you're looking at it
2007-03-27T09:30:00.000Z	GolferX	neozen	really?  this is it?
2007-03-27T09:31:00.000Z	GolferX	neozen	this channel is the one that distresses me.
2007-03-27T09:31:00.000Z	neozen	GolferX	eh?
2007-03-27T09:31:00.000Z	neozen	GolferX	what's your problem?
2007-03-27T09:34:00.000Z	GolferX	neozen	my computer problem is the blanking screen, dpms, and the whole shooting match that is found in gxset.  my Windows problem is deeper than I care to probe; I thought I had it neatly packaged away.
2007-03-27T09:34:00.000Z	neozen	GolferX	this is under edgy right?
2007-03-27T09:35:00.000Z	GolferX	neozen	yeah
2007-03-27T09:35:00.000Z	neozen	GolferX	to solve the blanking screen issue I installed dapper instead of edgy
2007-03-27T09:35:00.000Z	neozen	GolferX	this issue is not present AT ALL in dapper
2007-03-27T09:36:00.000Z	neozen	GolferX	that's neozen mate
2007-03-27T09:36:00.000Z	GolferX	neozen	do you know if Feisty will have it?
2007-03-27T09:37:00.000Z	neozen	GolferX	and when I fired up the last beta image I had... it didn't do it... this... is good
2007-03-27T09:37:00.000Z	neozen	GolferX	since it really ticked me off in edgy
2007-03-27T09:37:00.000Z	neozen	GolferX	no worries
2007-03-27T09:37:00.000Z	neozen	GolferX	I think its going to be ok
2007-03-27T09:37:00.000Z	GolferX	neozen	cool we are of like needs then
2007-03-27T09:38:00.000Z	neozen	GolferX	a little less then a month
2007-03-27T09:38:00.000Z	neozen	GolferX	and we get new linux... with fewer issues
