2005-03-29T10:31:00.000Z	sl64		i don't have the xp disk, all I have is a recovery partition
2005-03-29T10:31:00.000Z	sl64		can't get to it :(
2005-03-29T10:31:00.000Z	sl64		i tried
2005-03-29T10:31:00.000Z	sl64		it won't boot to the recovery console because that bootloader is blocking it
2005-03-29T10:31:00.000Z	sl64		i hope so
2005-03-29T10:31:00.000Z	sl64		lol
2005-03-29T10:31:00.000Z	sl64		any suggestions where?
2005-03-29T10:32:00.000Z	sl64		nope
2005-03-29T10:32:00.000Z	sl64		yeah
2005-03-29T10:32:00.000Z	P229	sl64	unless you have some way of booting from the recovery partition or booting from some disk that came with your computer, your windows installation is toast
2005-03-29T10:34:00.000Z	P229	sl64	uh, no
2005-03-29T10:34:00.000Z	P229	sl64	do you remember if you installed the bootloader onto the MBR or the first sector of your boot partition?
2005-03-29T10:35:00.000Z	P229	sl64	quite :)
2005-03-29T10:40:00.000Z	P229	sl64	no
2005-03-29T10:41:00.000Z	P229	sl64	theoretically, yes
2005-03-29T10:41:00.000Z	P229	sl64	practically, no
2005-03-29T10:42:00.000Z	P229	sl64	please list all your partitions and what's on them
2005-03-29T10:45:00.000Z	P229	sl64	get a Linux livecd and backup any documents, etc., from your windows installation, because I'm just about 100% certain you won't be able to ever boot that windows installation again
2005-03-29T10:47:00.000Z	P229	sl64	Knoppix will let you mount your NTFS partitions and read data from them
2005-03-29T10:49:00.000Z	P229	sl64	if you're lucky, there will be a boot information on /dev/hda1 (your recovery partition). use fdisk to toggle the boot flag on, then reboot
