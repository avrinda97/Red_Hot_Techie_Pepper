2010-05-19T11:19:00.000Z	dyllan		Hi Guys. As a normal user I cannot change my default printer through gnome-cups-manager, if i start the app from the command line i see these errors when trying to set a default printer; ** (gnome-cups-manager:10359): WARNING **: IPP request failed with status 1280
2010-05-19T11:21:00.000Z	jabirali	dyllan	have you tried using the web interface instead? I personally prefer it, as it is more featureful
2010-05-19T11:22:00.000Z	jabirali	dyllan	visit http://localhost:631 to configure printers from your webbrowser
2010-05-19T11:23:00.000Z	jabirali	dyllan	200 users? Why do you need to switch default printers as a user then?
2010-05-19T11:24:00.000Z	dyllan	jabirali	each users needs to be able to select their default printer, we have 4 branches, and at least 10 printers at each branch, users need to be able to set/ change their default printer as they require.
2010-05-19T11:25:00.000Z	jabirali	dyllan	aha, I see. Changing the default printer in gnome-cups-manager changes the default for _all_ users though
2010-05-19T11:26:00.000Z	jabirali	dyllan	that would configure what printer is used by default by the printer server
2010-05-19T11:26:00.000Z	dyllan	jabirali	ok that makes sense now, no wonder a normal user cant set that, so how would a user set their default then?
2010-05-19T11:29:00.000Z	jabirali	dyllan	I'm not quite sure... Are these users all on the same computer, or on different computers connected to a printer server by using /etc/cups/client.conf ?
2010-05-19T11:29:00.000Z	dyllan	jabirali	they are all on the same computer
2010-05-19T11:33:00.000Z	jabirali	dyllan	I'm googling ;). There was a tool called gnome-default-printer or something before, but it seems like it disappeared years ago :(
2010-05-19T11:34:00.000Z	jabirali	dyllan	right now I'm trying to figure out if there's some way to set the defaults for all GTK apps or something
2010-05-19T11:35:00.000Z	dyllan	jabirali	yup i also came across the gnome-default-printer but you are right it is no longer.. . im pretty stumped!
2010-05-19T11:40:00.000Z	jabirali	dyllan	seems like the "lp" commands at least listen to the environment variables PRINTER and LPDEST
2010-05-19T11:40:00.000Z	jabirali	dyllan	try: PRINTER="printername" gedit
2010-05-19T11:40:00.000Z	dyllan	jabirali	ok give me a sec
2010-05-19T11:40:00.000Z	jabirali	dyllan	I'm not sure if Gnome apps also adhere to this, or if it's only for lp commands
2010-05-19T11:41:00.000Z	dyllan	jabirali	ill try quick
2010-05-19T11:45:00.000Z	dyllan	jabirali	doesnt seem to work.. . appreciate the efforts though!
2010-05-19T11:46:00.000Z	jabirali	dyllan	OK then I'm afraid I'm out of suggestions :)
2010-05-19T11:48:00.000Z	dyllan	jabirali	no worries thanks for the help
