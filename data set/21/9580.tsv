2005-08-30T08:13:00.000Z	cafuego		What's the tool for converting JPEG sequences to MPEG?
2005-08-30T08:15:00.000Z	cafuego		(it's also broken on breezy x86_64 atm)
2005-08-30T08:17:00.000Z	cafuego		Which retard added FreeFormats to the RestrictedFormats wiki page?
2005-08-30T08:17:00.000Z	adriyel	cafuego	the same retard that didn't add restricted formats into the install CD, why?
2005-08-30T08:18:00.000Z	cafuego	adriyel	It suggests Ogg Vorbis/Theora (not used by anone, really) is all you need.
2005-08-30T08:18:00.000Z	adriyel	cafuego	LOL, ogg is all you need....yeah...right...if you're a game developer and all you do is produce games maybe...
2005-08-30T11:36:00.000Z	cafuego	adriyel	So can I; there are heaps of P4's without SSE3.
2005-08-30T11:36:00.000Z	adriyel	cafuego	indeed. but I can run Mac OS x86 on this thing, with rosetta with full acceleration
2005-08-30T11:37:00.000Z	cafuego	adriyel	I run it on the Macs, much nicer.
2005-08-30T11:37:00.000Z	adriyel	cafuego	only until the consumer intel macs come out
2005-08-30T11:37:00.000Z	cafuego	adriyel	That's YEARS away, though. '07 innit?
2005-08-30T11:38:00.000Z	cafuego	adriyel	Why would you prefer a P4 over an Athlon64? They cost more and do less. Marketing slaves :-P
2005-08-30T11:42:00.000Z	adriyel	cafuego	duh. :P
2005-08-30T11:47:00.000Z	cafuego	adriyel	How much is that in sane units?
2005-08-30T11:47:00.000Z	adriyel	cafuego	heh, you mean centigrade?
2005-08-30T11:47:00.000Z	cafuego	adriyel	Kelvin will do
2005-08-30T11:48:00.000Z	cafuego	adriyel	Nah, not really (really not)
2006-02-24T15:08:00.000Z	cafuego	adriyel	Change the line spacing?
2006-02-24T15:09:00.000Z	adriyel	cafuego	how?
2006-02-24T15:09:00.000Z	cafuego	adriyel	Format -> Paragraph -> [Indents & Spacing]  -> Line SPacing
2006-02-24T15:10:00.000Z	adriyel	cafuego	thank you
