2007-06-23T14:36:00.000Z	theme		I view an ungodly amount of pornography. How do I prevent it from showing up in 'recent documents' without needing to clear manually every time?
2007-06-23T14:37:00.000Z	theme		Anyone know?
2007-06-23T14:38:00.000Z	Andeh	theme	View it online using a firefox extension that disables logging when you enable it and starts again when you disable it lol
2007-06-23T14:39:00.000Z	theme	Andeh	I need to download and save said porn, since it's in .mpg format and the totem-xine browser plugin is broken.
2007-06-23T14:39:00.000Z	Andeh	theme	I was joking lol.
2007-06-23T14:39:00.000Z	Andeh	theme	Um... use VLC?
2007-06-23T14:39:00.000Z	theme	Andeh	I'm quite serious. Bondage tends to freak out my grandmother.
2007-06-23T14:39:00.000Z	Andeh	theme	She uses your account?
2007-06-23T14:40:00.000Z	theme	Andeh	I'd rather not keep multiple accounts on my laptop.
2007-06-23T14:40:00.000Z	Andeh	theme	If she knows to look into your recent documents for your porn, you might as well give her a seperate account
2007-06-23T14:40:00.000Z	Andeh	theme	lol
2007-06-23T14:40:00.000Z	Andeh	theme	Well letting them use your account then trying to stop them from seeing your stuff is a bit hard
2007-06-23T14:41:00.000Z	theme	Andeh	True, but Firefox's Distrust extension tends to work well. I just don't want recent documents saved because I don't need it anyway.
2007-06-23T14:41:00.000Z	Andeh	theme	Umm... well the only way i can think of would be not to open them through NAUTILUS, maybe another filer or through another video viewer
2007-06-23T14:42:00.000Z	Andeh	theme	oh, in that case, i'd google something like "ubuntu disable recent documents"
2007-06-23T14:42:00.000Z	theme	Andeh	That's a good idea, and I didn't think of that. Thanks.
2007-06-23T14:42:00.000Z	Andeh	theme	no problem :)
2007-06-23T14:44:00.000Z	Andeh	theme	I have something for you
