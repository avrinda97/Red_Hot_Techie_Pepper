2007-04-06T11:17:00.000Z	annihilus		im having a problem involving my gnome-panel, i at some point must have deleted the task icon for gaim and now it does not show the icon when it is running, i can still click where it should be, just no graphic, any ideas please
2007-04-06T11:18:00.000Z	annihilus		so try that then?
2007-04-06T11:18:00.000Z	annihilus		thanks
2007-04-06T11:19:00.000Z	xtknight	annihilus	it might also be hidden by the elements on the panel somehow
2007-04-06T11:23:00.000Z	annihilus	xtknight	its just showing a single vertical line of pixels now, but nothing else gained
2007-04-06T11:23:00.000Z	annihilus	xtknight	any other ideas
2007-04-06T11:23:00.000Z	xtknight	annihilus	the one with VLC problems?
2007-04-06T11:24:00.000Z	annihilus	xtknight	i was having probs with the gnome panel
2007-04-06T11:24:00.000Z	xtknight	annihilus	ohh
2007-04-06T11:24:00.000Z	xtknight	annihilus	dont know. sorry
2007-04-06T11:25:00.000Z	annihilus	xtknight	any idea where the icon would be stored
2007-04-06T11:25:00.000Z	xtknight	annihilus	do you have the Tray added to the panel?  any other tray icons showing up?
2007-04-06T11:25:00.000Z	annihilus	xtknight	i believe it is added since i am able to use the "icons" although i cant see them
2007-04-06T11:26:00.000Z	xtknight	annihilus	oh gaim icon is missing?  missing pixmap maybe, reinstall gaim>?
2007-04-06T11:26:00.000Z	annihilus	xtknight	tried that using synaptic, is there a specific way you knwo thats better
2007-04-06T11:27:00.000Z	xtknight	annihilus	uhhh..."sudo dpkg --force-all --purge gaim && sudo apt-get install gaim" i guess.  that may purge personal settings and logs though
2007-04-06T11:27:00.000Z	xtknight	annihilus	and i doubt it will fix the problem
2007-04-06T11:27:00.000Z	annihilus	xtknight	thanks for the try then
2007-04-06T12:03:00.000Z	annihilus	xtknight	hey again, i was the one having gaim icon problems, reinstalling ubuntu-desktop packg fixedd it, thanks for the help
2007-04-06T12:03:00.000Z	xtknight	annihilus	very interesting because that package doesnt contain any files
2007-04-06T12:04:00.000Z	xtknight	annihilus	at least as far as i know :O
