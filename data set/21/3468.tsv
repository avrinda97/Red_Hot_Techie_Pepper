2008-12-21T04:13:00.000Z	webternals		I did apt-get install cron but the cron jobs still don't run anyone have a clue
2008-12-21T04:14:00.000Z	unop	webternals	is the cron service running?
2008-12-21T04:14:00.000Z	webternals		yes
2008-12-21T04:14:00.000Z	unop	webternals	ok, how are you sure the jobs aren't being run?
2008-12-21T04:15:00.000Z	webternals		i set a simple one in /etc/crontab * * * * * root /bin/touch /root/test.test and no luck
2008-12-21T04:16:00.000Z	unop	webternals	have you checked your mail (or root's mail) for any errors -- and btw, touch should be /usr/bin/touch
2008-12-21T04:18:00.000Z	webternals	unop	this is a new server and I have not installed any "mail" capabilities yet
2008-12-21T04:19:00.000Z	unop	webternals	every system has a mail reader to read local mail - it should be at /usr/bin/mail
2008-12-21T04:20:00.000Z	webternals	unop	your statement is not entirely accurate
2008-12-21T04:21:00.000Z	unop	webternals	regardless, have you checked your mail????
2008-12-21T04:21:00.000Z	webternals	unop	There are no errors not even in the log files
2008-12-21T04:21:00.000Z	unop	webternals	errors are sent via mail ...
2008-12-21T04:23:00.000Z	unop		!screencast > Red_Wraith
2008-12-21T04:24:00.000Z	webternals	unop	no erros no mail no working cron, but I do have a pid for the cron service and it shows up in the /var/log/syslog file
2008-12-21T04:25:00.000Z	webternals	unop	i do keep gettin Dec 20 17:25:01 webternals CRON[15976]: User account has expired
2008-12-21T04:27:00.000Z	unop	webternals	 that's odd, if that error pertains to your job in /etc/crontab  - the root user account should never expire.
2008-12-21T04:27:00.000Z	unop	webternals	kill that old job and try another job perhaps?     */1 * * * *  root  echo hello world > /tmp/cron.test
2008-12-21T04:28:00.000Z	webternals	unop	I have tried several commands but I think I may look into why the root account is expired first
2008-12-21T04:32:00.000Z	webternals	unop	thanks for your help but my solution was fixing the root account
2008-12-21T04:32:00.000Z	unop	webternals	cool - but that's odd.
2008-12-21T04:33:00.000Z	webternals	unop	passwd -l root obviously messes up cron jobs
