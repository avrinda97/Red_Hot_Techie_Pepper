2007-03-16T12:20:00.000Z	billy	thcmonkey	 someone here would probably help you if they knew the answer to your question.  since you're already in freenode, join #beryl.  They ought to know.  :)
2007-03-16T12:20:00.000Z	thcmonkey	billy	cheers, i'm in there now

2007-03-18T05:09:00.000Z	billy	thcmonkey	 there's a package, something like 935resolution, or something, that'll help.
2007-03-18T05:09:00.000Z	thcmonkey	billy	on synaptic?
2007-03-18T05:10:00.000Z	billy	thcmonkey	yeah.  it's called 915resolution.

2007-03-18T05:10:00.000Z	billy	thcmonkey	but it's for Intel.
2007-03-18T05:12:00.000Z	thcmonkey	billy	i can't find it on feisty
2007-03-18T05:13:00.000Z	billy	thcmonkey	 #ubuntu+1
2007-03-18T05:13:00.000Z	billy	thcmonkey	try backports repository, perhaps.
2007-03-18T05:13:00.000Z	billy	thcmonkey	don't know about that though.
2007-03-18T05:16:00.000Z	billy	thcmonkey	your resolution is pretty good.  sometimes we just have to deal.
2007-03-18T05:17:00.000Z	thcmonkey	billy	i know what you're saying... it's just when i know something is capable of doing something and i can't get it to do it
2007-03-18T05:17:00.000Z	billy	thcmonkey	i know what you mean.  if it really bugs you, perhaps try enabling the backports repository in Feisty, if it even has one.  Don't know.
2007-03-18T05:19:00.000Z	billy	thcmonkey	please don't use vulgarity.
2007-03-18T05:19:00.000Z	thcmonkey	billy	sorry dude
2007-03-18T05:20:00.000Z	billy	thcmonkey	not me personally, but it's a room rule that we all have to respect.
2007-03-18T05:20:00.000Z	thcmonkey	billy	i know
