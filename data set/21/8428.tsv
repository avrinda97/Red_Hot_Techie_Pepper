2006-11-19T06:22:00.000Z	johan1		Has anyone here ever got SQL Ledger to work on Ubuntu? It tells me it is installed  ... but I have no idea where!!!!! HELP!!!!!
2006-11-19T06:23:00.000Z	roryy	johan1	maybe look in /usr/share/sql-ledger, or run 'dpkg -L sql-ledger'
2006-11-19T06:23:00.000Z	johan1		thanks roryy
2006-11-19T06:23:00.000Z	roryy	johan1	it looks like you access the program via a web-browser; not sure how you'd set it up
2006-11-19T06:26:00.000Z	johan1	roryy	- just two pics where you said to look ....
2006-11-19T06:26:00.000Z	roryy	johan1	hrm
2006-11-19T06:27:00.000Z	roryy	johan1	try running 'dpkg -L sql-ledger'; otherwise, the only thing I can suggest is Google (presumable this program has a homepage)
2006-11-19T06:27:00.000Z	johan1	roryy	there will be a setup or something somewhere I would guess - Any thoughts where? I would have thought it would have set it up and added an icon to the menu ...
2006-11-19T06:28:00.000Z	roryy	johan1	unfortunately (and I'm guessing here) it probably doesn't have a nice GUI setup
2006-11-19T06:28:00.000Z	johan1	roryy	- decoders for TOTEM ... where and how anyone????
2006-11-19T06:28:00.000Z	roryy		!restricted | johan1
2006-11-19T06:29:00.000Z	roryy	johan1	the RestrictedFormats page linked to there should help
2006-11-19T06:30:00.000Z	johan1		thanks roryy - more pages of reading - I just wish this thing would work ..... I know why people go back to windows .... I don't have time for all this program language crap....
2006-11-19T06:30:00.000Z	roryy	johan1	we're trying :-)
2006-11-19T06:31:00.000Z	johan1		sorry roryy - thanks for your help .... Is the latest version of Ubuntu worth the upgrade? and will it run on a pent III?
2006-11-19T06:32:00.000Z	roryy	johan1	it should; I think RAM is often the biggest limiter
2006-11-19T06:32:00.000Z	johan1	roryy	is the latest version worth the effort? Is it much improved???
2006-11-19T06:32:00.000Z	roryy	johan1	also, there are ubuntu variants you can use that require fewer resources. xubuntu is a popular one
2006-11-19T06:33:00.000Z	roryy	johan1	possibly not.  If you're running ubuntu 6.06, you'll get updates for the next 2.5 years; for this release (6.10) only for the next 1.5 years
2006-11-19T06:33:00.000Z	roryy	johan1	where 'update' refers to fixes for critical bugs and security problems, not software version upgrades
2006-11-19T06:34:00.000Z	johan1	roryy	Thanks very much and keep on working at it!!!!
