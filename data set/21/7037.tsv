2006-12-10T08:29:00.000Z	frogzoo	ollekalle2	you check /var/log/messages?
2006-12-10T08:30:00.000Z	frogzoo	ollekalle2	try mii-tool, use -F to disable autoneg & set speed/duplex manually
2006-12-10T08:47:00.000Z	frogzoo	ollekalle2	is this 10 or 100bps & is it full duplex into a switch, or half duplex into a hub?
2006-12-10T08:48:00.000Z	ollekalle2	frogzoo	I have a d-link router 624+ and it wired connection. Does this answer you question? :/
2006-12-10T08:48:00.000Z	frogzoo	ollekalle2	is it 10Mbps of 100Mbps ?
2006-12-10T08:49:00.000Z	ollekalle2	frogzoo	I have 100Mbit.
2006-12-10T08:50:00.000Z	frogzoo	ollekalle2	try 'sudo  mii-tool eth0 -F 100baseTx-FD'  & then try dhcpclient again
2006-12-10T08:51:00.000Z	frogzoo	ollekalle2	you may also need to check the same settings on the router
2006-12-10T08:52:00.000Z	ollekalle2	frogzoo	looks much better now! How do I assure that setting is static?
2006-12-10T08:55:00.000Z	frogzoo	ollekalle2	at the bottom of the eth0 section in /etc/network/interfaces, add a line 'pre-up mii-tool eth0 -F 100baseTx-FD'
2006-12-10T09:02:00.000Z	ollekalle2	frogzoo	sorry for additional bothering. It seems like my fooling around today made the eth0 not to enable at boot time. Do you know how to make it auto-enable?
2006-12-10T08:58:00.000Z	ollekalle2	frogzoo	more than thanks!
2006-12-10T08:58:00.000Z	frogzoo	ollekalle2	yw, enjoy
2006-12-10T09:03:00.000Z	frogzoo	ollekalle2	in /etc/network/interfaces, you need a line 'auto eth0'
2006-12-10T09:04:00.000Z	ollekalle2	frogzoo	I have already... :/ any perticular order?
2006-12-10T09:04:00.000Z	frogzoo	ollekalle2	it will only come up automatically at boot
2006-12-10T09:05:00.000Z	ollekalle2	frogzoo	my interfaces says: iface eth0 inet dhcp;auto eth0;pre-up mii-tool eth0 -F 100baseTx-FD
2006-12-10T09:05:00.000Z	frogzoo	ollekalle2	the auto eth0 should come first
2006-12-10T09:05:00.000Z	ollekalle2	frogzoo	I just restarted my computer (shutdown -r now)
2006-12-10T09:05:00.000Z	ollekalle2	frogzoo	I will try witg that one first
2006-12-10T09:08:00.000Z	ollekalle2	frogzoo	even eith "auto eth0" at top I need to run dhclient manually to get a IP.
