2007-10-22T07:03:00.000Z	ShadowMinds		Hi guys;
2007-10-22T07:04:00.000Z	ShadowMinds		what would cause ACPI error on boot up? Using 7.10 Gutsy. Says my BIOS is out-dated, its a 2001 bios.
2007-10-22T07:05:00.000Z	bbrazil	ShadowMinds	hardware failure, software failure, incompatabilties - the usual. Try the 'noacpi' kernel boot option
2007-10-22T07:05:00.000Z	ShadowMinds	bbrazil	how do i do that? acpi is disabled in my bios. i can boot with the live cd but i can't get it booted in safe mode or by the start/install option
2007-10-22T07:06:00.000Z	bbrazil	ShadowMinds	been a while, but try 'linux noacpi' at the boot prompt
2007-10-22T07:06:00.000Z	ShadowMinds	bbrazil	i also recieve a Kernel error too that says its killing a idle process?
2007-10-22T07:06:00.000Z	ShadowMinds	bbrazil	at boot prompt?
2007-10-22T07:07:00.000Z	bbrazil	ShadowMinds	yes, first thing that should come up after the bios is done
2007-10-22T07:08:00.000Z	ShadowMinds	bbrazil	i got disconencted lol sorry
2007-10-22T07:08:00.000Z	ShadowMinds	bbrazil	boot prompt in linux where at? after grub?
2007-10-22T07:09:00.000Z	bbrazil	ShadowMinds	in grub
2007-10-22T07:09:00.000Z	ShadowMinds	bbrazil	in grub what do i type? to get to command line?
2007-10-22T07:09:00.000Z	bbrazil	ShadowMinds	I forget the exact steps, but you need to edit the kernel boot line and add noacpi
2007-10-22T07:09:00.000Z	ShadowMinds	bbrazil	is it ctrl alt f1?
2007-10-22T07:09:00.000Z	bbrazil	ShadowMinds	no, that's for the bios. Could be 'e'
2007-10-22T07:09:00.000Z	ShadowMinds	bbrazil	oh ok i remember the options
2007-10-22T07:10:00.000Z	ShadowMinds	bbrazil	i'll try it right quick if i don't get a hang on NVRAM
2007-10-22T07:10:00.000Z	ShadowMinds	bbrazil	i also am recieving that too
2007-10-22T07:10:00.000Z	ShadowMinds	bbrazil	after replacing my board
2007-10-22T07:13:00.000Z	ShadowMinds	bbrazil	i can't get past NVRAM now
2007-10-22T07:14:00.000Z	ShadowMinds	bbrazil	i think my board got hosed or something, not sure i'm going to try another board sometime this week thanks for help
