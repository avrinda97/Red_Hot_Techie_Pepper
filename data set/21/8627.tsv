2006-03-07T12:05:00.000Z	variable		for some reason firefox doesnt and hasnt had sound
2006-03-07T12:07:00.000Z	gnomefreak	variable	have you tried installing some of the plug-ins for sound?
2006-03-07T12:10:00.000Z	variable	gnomefreak	what plugins?
2006-03-07T12:11:00.000Z	variable	gnomefreak	i searched for firefox sound, and found nothing
2006-03-07T12:12:00.000Z	gnomefreak	variable	https://pfs.mozilla.org/plugins/?application=firefox
2006-03-07T12:14:00.000Z	variable	gnomefreak	i have mplayer and flash installed, both have no sound
2006-03-07T12:16:00.000Z	variable	gnomefreak	is there some other plugin i need specifically for firefox to play sound?
2006-03-07T12:16:00.000Z	gnomefreak	variable	what type of file is it?
2006-03-07T12:17:00.000Z	variable	gnomefreak	any file, beit website, flash, avi anything = no sound
2006-03-07T12:19:00.000Z	variable	gnomefreak	i is this a firefox problem, ubuntu problem, or elsewhere?
2006-03-07T12:19:00.000Z	gnomefreak	variable	not sure is mplayer your default player for ff
2006-03-07T12:19:00.000Z	variable	gnomefreak	well outside of firefox, mplayer works fine
2006-03-07T12:20:00.000Z	gnomefreak	variable	ok is your default player for ff mplayer?
2006-03-07T12:20:00.000Z	variable	gnomefreak	how would i check?
2006-03-07T12:20:00.000Z	gnomefreak	variable	in ff settings somewhere
2006-03-07T12:23:00.000Z	variable	gnomefreak	i dont see a setting, but id assume it is since mplayer pops up for any media files that arent flash
2006-03-07T12:25:00.000Z	gnomefreak	variable	im not sure it seems you have everything you would need but really depends on the file itsself there are seprate libs for mp3s and alot of win files
2006-03-07T12:25:00.000Z	variable	gnomefreak	but all the same files work if i dl them and play them like that
2006-03-07T12:25:00.000Z	variable	gnomefreak	so doesnt it have to be in firefox
2006-03-07T12:26:00.000Z	variable	gnomefreak	me? its 1.0.7 firefox
2006-03-07T12:27:00.000Z	gnomefreak	variable	no i dont know the answer to your issue it seems you have everything you need for basic files and if the file works under download nad not in ff i would try #firefox
