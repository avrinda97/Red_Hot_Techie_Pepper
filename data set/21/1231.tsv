2011-03-22T15:30:00.000Z	sniperjo_		Ive got a bash script uses mplayer to play a video file. After mplayer is done playing the file, it quits and seems to quit the bash script before it can finnish. Any ideas why this is happening / how to stop it ?
2011-03-22T15:32:00.000Z	soerenbnoergaard	sniperjo_	What does your script look like?
2011-03-22T15:34:00.000Z	sniperjo_	soerenbnoergaard	mplayer -zoom -fs thefile.mp4 , once the video is finiished playing mplayer outputs "Exiting... End of file"  and dies, and seems to kill my bash script with it
2011-03-22T15:35:00.000Z	soerenbnoergaard	sniperjo_	Is there anything after that line in the bash script?
2011-03-22T15:35:00.000Z	sniperjo_	soerenbnoergaard	 yea.. echo "why isnt this working"
2011-03-22T15:38:00.000Z	soerenbnoergaard	sniperjo_	Hmm.. I made a script writing mplayer mp3.mp3; echo "Hi" and it worked fine..
2011-03-22T15:38:00.000Z	soerenbnoergaard	sniperjo_	Echoes "Hi" after playing the file.
2011-03-22T15:39:00.000Z	soerenbnoergaard	sniperjo_	Do you have #!/bin/bash in the start of the file?
2011-03-22T15:40:00.000Z	sniperjo_	soerenbnoergaard	hang on ill posit it on pastebin

2011-03-22T15:43:00.000Z	soerenbnoergaard	sniperjo_	So it doesn't stay in the while-loop?
2011-03-22T15:44:00.000Z	sniperjo_	soerenbnoergaard	no, hops out of it for some reason
2011-03-22T15:47:00.000Z	soerenbnoergaard	sniperjo_	I'm not that into bash loops, but maybe you could get it to continue even though it gets EOF.
2011-03-22T15:49:00.000Z	soerenbnoergaard	sniperjo_	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3628677/how-to-make-tclsh-to-ignore-eof Perhaps this could help?
2011-03-22T15:51:00.000Z	sniperjo_	soerenbnoergaard	 so you think bash is getting confused which EOF its found ?
2011-03-22T15:51:00.000Z	soerenbnoergaard	sniperjo_	Well, it seems mplayer is calling End of file on exit. Try it
2011-03-22T15:55:00.000Z	sniperjo_	soerenbnoergaard	 export ignoreeof=1 doesnt change anything
2011-03-22T15:55:00.000Z	soerenbnoergaard	sniperjo_	Worth a shot...
2011-03-22T15:56:00.000Z	sniperjo_	soerenbnoergaard	: someone from the mplayer board said :  while read line; do echo "$line"; mplayer -really-quiet "$line"; done <playlist1 # that plays the first file, but skips around in it and stuff, like it's getting commands from the playlist...
2011-03-22T15:58:00.000Z	soerenbnoergaard	sniperjo_	I have to go now, but maybe someone on #mplayer can help you. Good luck :)
2011-03-22T15:58:00.000Z	sniperjo_	soerenbnoergaard	thanks for the help
