2008-03-23T20:56:00.000Z	sinnus		When I unplug then plug network cable ethernet connection is lost. What should I do to reconfigure eth0 interface every time when cable unplug / plug?
2008-03-23T20:57:00.000Z	sinnus		I have found this solution: http://0pointer.de/lennart/projects/ifplugd/#overview
2008-03-23T20:58:00.000Z	sinnus		automatically reconfigure network
2008-03-23T20:58:00.000Z	sinnus		When I unplug / plug cable network is unavailable
2008-03-23T21:00:00.000Z	macogw	sinnus	is this on gutsy?
2008-03-23T21:01:00.000Z	sinnus	macogw	yes
2008-03-23T21:01:00.000Z	macogw	sinnus	known bug, fixed in next month's release
2008-03-23T21:02:00.000Z	sinnus	macogw	Could you get me link for that bug?
2008-03-23T21:03:00.000Z	macogw	sinnus	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/network-manager/+bug/148630
2008-03-23T21:03:00.000Z	macogw	sinnus	i titled it as after wireless is used, but wireless being used would be "it's unplugged" :P
2008-03-23T21:04:00.000Z	sinnus	macogw	I don't use network-manager. I turned off it
2008-03-23T21:05:00.000Z	macogw	sinnus	oh :/ well nothing was actually manually done to NM for that bug, as far as i know...it was just "hey umm it works now" and then the bug was closed
2008-03-23T21:05:00.000Z	macogw	sinnus	so it could very easily have been some underlying thing not registering the event to pass it to NM
2008-03-23T21:06:00.000Z	macogw	sinnus	NM is where i saw the evidence of it and where i filed it
2008-03-23T21:07:00.000Z	sinnus	macogw	NW doesn't support pppoe and I turend off it
2008-03-23T21:07:00.000Z	macogw	sinnus	i think it has a plugin for it
2008-03-23T21:07:00.000Z	macogw	sinnus	network-manager-pptp
2008-03-23T21:07:00.000Z	sinnus	macogw	In the future
2008-03-23T21:07:00.000Z	sinnus	macogw	pppoe
2008-03-23T21:08:00.000Z	macogw	sinnus	but i mean i think maybe something lower down....like hal maybe....wasnt noticing it being plugged in, so thats why youre having trouble and why i had trouble with nm (because nm gets its info from hal), but now thats fixed
2008-03-23T21:08:00.000Z	sinnus	macogw	I see, thanx
