2006-04-20T12:41:00.000Z	AAA	Kumo	 shouldn't dsl-provider and ppp0 be swapped in that file?
2006-04-20T13:12:00.000Z	Kumo	AAA	ok, I haven't done it yet
2006-04-20T13:21:00.000Z	AAA	Kumo	 the Sxx tells init what order to start the script just as Kxx will kill in that order
2006-04-20T13:21:00.000Z	Kumo	AAA	ok, so what do you recommend me?
2006-04-20T13:22:00.000Z	AAA	Kumo	 update-rc.d -f <script name> defaults
2006-04-20T13:22:00.000Z	Kumo	AAA	ok but the name of the file? it doesn't matter?
2006-04-20T13:30:00.000Z	AAA	Kumo	 w0000 WTF
2006-04-20T13:30:00.000Z	AAA	Kumo	 or just init 2

2006-04-20T13:33:00.000Z	AAA	Kumo	 and you can switch runlevels without rebooting to test, just use init 2 and it will go through your init files in rc2
2006-04-20T13:33:00.000Z	Kumo	AAA	sudo init 2
2006-04-20T13:33:00.000Z	AAA	Kumo	 yeah, that should do it

2006-04-20T13:35:00.000Z	Kumo	AAA	do I have to see something here?
