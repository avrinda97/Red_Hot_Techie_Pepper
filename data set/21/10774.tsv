2006-09-26T07:08:00.000Z	abk		hey guys, SSH issue here
2006-09-26T07:08:00.000Z	abk		I can ssh into my own machine remotely A-OK
2006-09-26T07:09:00.000Z	abk		*sorry hit enter too soon
2006-09-26T07:10:00.000Z	abk		I can SSH into my own machine just fine. I made a new user account, though, and now he can't log in at all. I can't log in as him either. when we type ssh him@mydomain.com, it asks for the password but then gives a "Sorry, permission denied" error
2006-09-26T07:11:00.000Z	abk		I can "sudo su Username" and use his account
2006-09-26T07:13:00.000Z	abk		xenguy: I've tried deleting his acc and making a new user (same shortname) and also resetting his PW in the gui CP, do you mean something else?
2006-09-26T07:15:00.000Z	abk		xenguy: of course. any ideas on why it wouldn't work?
2006-09-26T07:16:00.000Z	abk		xenguy: well, I just made a new user with different short name and three-character PW to make sure I was typing it all OK
2006-09-26T07:16:00.000Z	abk		still not able to log in locally.
2006-09-26T07:17:00.000Z	Xenguy	abk	that makes no sense tho - try changing the passwd on the command-line?
2006-09-26T07:11:00.000Z	Xenguy	abk	can you log in as the new user locally?
2006-09-26T07:11:00.000Z	Xenguy	abk	i.e. without ssh
2006-09-26T07:12:00.000Z	Xenguy	abk	try resetting the passwd perhaps
2006-09-26T07:14:00.000Z	Xenguy	abk	no, just thought resetting the passwd was a good place to start; obviously if you can't log into an account locally as a user it's not going to work over ssh
2006-09-26T07:15:00.000Z	Xenguy	abk	for a different method, you could just try (as root): passwd username
2006-09-26T07:15:00.000Z	Xenguy	abk	typically a password is being typed incorrectly
2006-09-26T07:16:00.000Z	Xenguy	abk	substitute the login name for 'username' of course
2006-09-26T07:18:00.000Z	Xenguy	abk	or try using 'adduser' to create the new account ?
2006-09-26T07:20:00.000Z	Xenguy	abk	deluser
2006-09-26T07:20:00.000Z	Xenguy	abk	man deluser for some good options
2006-09-26T07:20:00.000Z	Xenguy	abk	yw
