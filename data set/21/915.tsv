2011-04-17T13:08:00.000Z	TheAnyInbox	doobien	Ah, thx
2011-04-17T13:08:00.000Z	TheAnyInbox		How do i do that :X
2011-04-17T13:10:00.000Z	doobien	TheAnyInbox	something like sudo chroot /dev/sda2

2011-04-17T13:14:00.000Z	doobien	TheAnyInbox	maybe you have to mount it first - before you can chroot to it. mount -t ext4 /dev/sda2 /mnt
