2012-02-11T04:05:00.000Z	gogeta	Harold	initramfs is saying its loading the kernel into ram is it sticking there?
2012-02-11T04:06:00.000Z	gogeta	Harold	thats bad seems like you smoked the fs
2012-02-11T04:07:00.000Z	gogeta	Harold	filesystem you can try to boot recovery and reinstall the kernel might get it back
2012-02-11T04:07:00.000Z	gogeta	Harold	press escape when grub pops up you have to be quick with it
2012-02-11T04:07:00.000Z	gogeta	Harold	being thats the same hotkey for boot slect
2012-02-11T04:09:00.000Z	gogeta	Harold	passes the eepc splash not ubuntu
2012-02-11T04:09:00.000Z	gogeta	Harold	to soon you will get boot menu to late it will just boot like normal its a bit of a pain

2012-02-11T04:11:00.000Z	gogeta	Harold	i think you might have to just reinsall hate to say that but if you cant get to at least recovery its kinda the only option
2012-02-11T04:11:00.000Z	gogeta	Harold	:( id your sssd failing
2012-02-11T04:12:00.000Z	gogeta	Harold	are you trying to use btrfs
2012-02-11T04:12:00.000Z	gogeta	Harold	that failes
2012-02-11T04:13:00.000Z	gogeta	Harold	thats the issue btrfs is broken on 11.10 use ext2 it should work fine
2012-02-11T04:14:00.000Z	gogeta	Harold	btrfs thinks your drive is always full causing the install to fail
2012-02-11T04:15:00.000Z	gogeta	Harold	on partating slect advanced or maunal and in the menu slect ext2 rather then btrfs
2012-02-11T04:15:00.000Z	gogeta	Harold	if your drives ssd slect 1 single partation with no swap
2012-02-11T04:17:00.000Z	gogeta	Harold	i thought you installed it before
2012-02-11T04:17:00.000Z	gogeta	Harold	on the partating screen simply slect something else thats advanced
