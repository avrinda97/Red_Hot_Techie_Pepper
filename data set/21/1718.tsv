2010-05-19T07:44:00.000Z	Jon--		Looking to install ZSNES (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Zsnes), but I get "Package zsnes is not available, but is referred to by another package."  Does this mean that there is no package for 10.04? Does it work with Wine or another alternative? What do other people use for SNES emulators?
2010-05-19T07:45:00.000Z	Ubantu_dude	Jon--	 Run apt-get update, I installed zsnes not to long ago on htpc and it went fine
2010-05-19T07:45:00.000Z	Jon--	Ubantu_dude	I did, still get no install candidate.
2010-05-19T07:45:00.000Z	Ubantu_dude	Jon--	just ran apt-get install zsnes and it ran fine for me
2010-05-19T07:46:00.000Z	Ubantu_dude	Jon--	maybe just get the deb and install it with dpkg
2010-05-19T07:47:00.000Z	Jon--	Ubantu_dude	See http://pastebin.org/251538  Trust me, not working :P
2010-05-19T07:47:00.000Z	Ubantu_dude	Jon--	 I believe you, let me dig into it for a second
2010-05-19T07:49:00.000Z	Jon--	Ubantu_dude	See http://pastebin.org/251538  Trust me, not working :P
2010-05-19T07:50:00.000Z	Jon--	Ubantu_dude	Sorry, accidently hit up arrow
2010-05-19T07:52:00.000Z	Ubantu_dude	Jon--	looking at your paste bin you seem to have all the repos enabled
2010-05-19T07:53:00.000Z	Jon--	Ubantu_dude	I do, and no package for zsnes
2010-05-19T07:53:00.000Z	Ubantu_dude	Jon--	you are on lucid though but all of my HTPCs and server run karmic so that may be why I have no problems but you do
2010-05-19T07:54:00.000Z	Ubantu_dude	Jon--	that could be a problem
2010-05-19T07:56:00.000Z	Ubantu_dude	Jon--	 You could roll the dice and compile it
2010-05-19T07:56:00.000Z	Ubantu_dude	Jon--	 Then again I am almost positive zsnes relies on nasm which may be an issue
2010-05-19T07:57:00.000Z	Jon--	Ubantu_dude	onetinsoldier: Found a .tar.bz from zsnes website. a ./configure had the line "Configure complete, now type 'make' and pray."  Nice touch. I'll give it a try
2010-05-19T07:58:00.000Z	Ubantu_dude	Jon--	 You may have to try an alt. like Zsnes or Raine
2010-05-19T07:59:00.000Z	Jon--	Ubantu_dude	I will try Wine first. I love ZSNES
2010-05-19T07:59:00.000Z	Ubantu_dude	Jon--	 Any real reason you are stuck on zsnes?
2010-05-19T08:00:00.000Z	Jon--	Ubantu_dude	Used to hotkeys/interface and it plays ROMs much more stable than other ones Ihave tried
2010-05-19T08:00:00.000Z	Ubantu_dude	Jon--	 Ok just curious
