2011-01-19T00:46:00.000Z	inashdeen	SOMEGUY4	what is written on bios?
2011-01-19T00:47:00.000Z	inashdeen	SOMEGUY4	i mean when u start your computer, with the hdd attached what does it says?
2011-01-19T00:48:00.000Z	inashdeen	SOMEGUY4	 or the 3rd is maybe the pin is faulty due to change every now and then
2011-01-19T00:48:00.000Z	inashdeen	SOMEGUY4	ok, here is to thing that might happen, it is either u r having to master or the pin is not set correctly
2011-01-19T00:51:00.000Z	inashdeen	SOMEGUY4	try to pull out and pin it back ( the pin), then make sure the cable is correct
2011-01-19T00:51:00.000Z	inashdeen	SOMEGUY4	well, the best,to keep it cool for sometimes
2011-01-19T00:52:00.000Z	inashdeen	SOMEGUY4	then only try it again, my experience on desktops, cooling is the best medicine ;-)
2011-01-19T00:53:00.000Z	inashdeen	SOMEGUY4	not sure if this works for everyone, but sometimes, computer, especially an old machine gets buggy of constant changing of hardwares. so try to let it cool for sometimes
2011-01-19T00:54:00.000Z	inashdeen	SOMEGUY4	ok, now, do everthing all over again, from start. just make sure, other pins are in correct position, u might be having two masters
2011-01-19T00:56:00.000Z	inashdeen	SOMEGUY4	any luck?
