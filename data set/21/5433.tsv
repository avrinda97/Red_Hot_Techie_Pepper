2007-12-04T18:50:00.000Z	wols	ubstud	what card?
2007-12-04T18:51:00.000Z	ubstud	wols	01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. S3 Unichrome Pro VGA Adapter (rev 01)
2007-12-04T18:51:00.000Z	wols	ubstud	the problem is the segfault at the end. but your card is quite shitty anyways. so I'd say: no. doesn't work
2007-12-04T18:51:00.000Z	wols	ubstud	and I doubt you can do compiz with that card anyways
2007-12-04T18:52:00.000Z	ubstud	wols	but all cards support 3d acceleration don't they?
2007-12-04T18:52:00.000Z	wols	ubstud	no
2007-12-04T18:52:00.000Z	ubstud	wols	and this one doesn't?
2007-12-04T18:52:00.000Z	ubstud	wols	but I've ran 3d games on here
2007-12-04T18:53:00.000Z	wols	ubstud	s3 cards are very poorly supported under linux. 2D might be fine but I dunno if 3D works
2007-12-04T18:54:00.000Z	ubstud	wols	is there a way to check if mine is working fine or not? Cause I've run 3d games on here before
2007-12-04T18:54:00.000Z	wols	ubstud	under linux?
2007-12-04T18:54:00.000Z	wols	ubstud	then you are SOL
2007-12-04T18:55:00.000Z	ubstud	wols	what do you mean by "SOL"?
2007-12-04T19:00:00.000Z	ubstud	wols	still there?
