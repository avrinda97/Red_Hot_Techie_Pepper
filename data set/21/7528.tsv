2006-09-11T12:55:00.000Z	frying_fish	CooL--PenguiN	just update to edgy now :p
2006-09-11T12:56:00.000Z	frying_fish	CooL--PenguiN	yes, but with a release in just over 1 month its pretty good
2006-09-11T12:57:00.000Z	frying_fish	CooL--PenguiN	I am now, I upgraded on saturday.
2006-09-11T12:59:00.000Z	frying_fish	CooL--PenguiN	yes, much better than IDE
2006-09-11T13:01:00.000Z	frying_fish	CooL--PenguiN	also, you can't install windows onto a lot of sata drives, without a floppy disk drive, because it needs drivers from a floppy disk, not from a cd, and I don't have a floppy drive.
