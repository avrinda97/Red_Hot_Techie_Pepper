2006-02-22T13:24:00.000Z	kameron		how do i change my dns in firefox?
2006-02-22T13:26:00.000Z	r0d	kameron	use dig
2006-02-22T13:26:00.000Z	kameron	r0d	is that a front end to /etc/resolv.conf ?
2006-02-22T13:27:00.000Z	r0d	kameron	its a program you use to get dns entries from spefic dns servers
2006-02-22T13:39:00.000Z	r0d	kameron	how so, the syntax timfrost gave you should work
2006-02-22T13:39:00.000Z	r0d	kameron	"man dig" will explain more
2006-02-22T13:42:00.000Z	r0d	kameron	I not totally sure what you want to do. are you trying to use your friends dns server, and not your ISP's for dns?
2006-02-22T13:42:00.000Z	r0d	kameron	like trying to access websites using his dns server
2006-02-22T13:43:00.000Z	kameron	r0d	i think so.
2006-02-22T13:43:00.000Z	r0d	kameron	I think you guys need a better game plan first and understand how dns works before you do that
2006-02-22T13:44:00.000Z	r0d	kameron	use dig to see individual entires(example www.foo.com=12.2.33.2)
2006-02-22T13:44:00.000Z	kameron	r0d	okay, i think that's what i'm lookign for.
2006-02-22T13:45:00.000Z	kameron	r0d	i understand what dns is and how it works, i've just never queried a dns server other than the one i'm assigned to through dhcp.
2006-02-22T13:48:00.000Z	r0d	kameron	is your friends dns server registered, or do you have to connect to it w/ an ip address?
2006-02-22T13:49:00.000Z	kameron	r0d	hah, yayyy, gui
2006-02-22T13:49:00.000Z	r0d	kameron	did you try "dig <ip add>"?
2006-02-22T13:49:00.000Z	kameron	r0d	no, i got it working though just now!
2006-02-22T13:50:00.000Z	r0d	kameron	cool
2006-02-22T14:00:00.000Z	r0d	kameron	if you don't mind install qt files to use it, that will work
2006-02-22T14:01:00.000Z	kameron	r0d	i have kde/qt stuff installed. what's will work?
2006-02-22T14:01:00.000Z	kameron	r0d	gnetutil?
