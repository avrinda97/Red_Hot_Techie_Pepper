2006-11-02T15:48:00.000Z	blazemonger		are there any kind of ideal settings for adjustinhg a crt display
2006-11-02T15:48:00.000Z	blazemonger		sorry if it sounds like a dumb question
2006-11-02T15:49:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	blazemonger	that depends 100% on what your objective is =)
2006-11-02T15:49:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	blazemonger	if you're a printing company, then you would use printing profiles to tune the monitor to your specific printer.  if you're a Joe Schmoe, I recommend a radiation screen or turning the brightness down so your eyes don't fry =p
2006-11-02T15:50:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	blazemonger	hm.  that surprises me
2006-11-02T15:50:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	blazemonger	my printer doesn't have colour, so I'm not sure what to suggest
2006-11-02T15:50:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	blazemonger	it surprises me because my printer has so many options on that screen
2006-11-02T15:51:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	blazemonger	are you using a generic driver, instead of a specific one for the model of printer ?
2006-11-02T15:51:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	blazemonger	oops, that was meant for bthibault
2006-11-02T15:57:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	blazemonger	first off, if the screen is radically screwed up, then it is a driver issue, not a setting
2006-11-02T15:57:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	blazemonger	first step: enter the refresh rate range for your monitor manually in xorg.conf
2006-11-02T15:58:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	blazemonger	second step: find a video mode that works well with your monitor, and set that as the default resolution
2006-11-02T15:59:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	blazemonger	for example my monitor/driver for whatever reason can do 320x240, 400x300, 640x480, 1024x768 and 1280x1024 fine, but it royally screws up on 1280x960
2006-11-02T15:59:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	blazemonger	also keep in mind that if your monitor is turned off when you boot up Xorg, it won't be able to autodetect your monitor settings.  that is one more reason to manually put in the refresh ranges for the monitor
2006-11-02T16:00:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	blazemonger	use xvidtune if your monitor does not remember settings for individual modes (e.g. an old monitor with analog dials on it)
2006-11-02T16:01:00.000Z	blazemonger	Samus_Aran	things like the geometry settings are screwed ..and cant find the right trapezoid settings i had before
2006-11-02T16:01:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	blazemonger	otherwise steer clear of it
2006-11-02T16:01:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	blazemonger	if you were playing with your monitor controls, find the reset option
2006-11-02T16:01:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	blazemonger	defaults are better than trying to fix it when it's all mucked up
2006-11-02T16:02:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	blazemonger	I've not seen a monitor that had digital controls but no reset option for several years now
2006-11-02T16:02:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	blazemonger	some monitors have an actual button for resetting the options to factory defaults
