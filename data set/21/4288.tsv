2009-09-11T00:37:00.000Z	xteejx		How can I install Ubuntu on an OLD PC which has no CD-ROM drive, no ethernet port, and cannot boot from USB? I'm trying to resurrect some life into something old and can;t think how to do it. Please help.
2009-09-11T00:38:00.000Z	xteejx		lol
2009-09-11T00:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	xteejx	Does it have Windows on it?
2009-09-11T00:39:00.000Z	xteejx	sebsebseb	it does yeah, and i have a wifi stick but can't get drivers to it cuz the cd drive is broken lol
2009-09-11T00:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	xteejx	How much RAM, and which version of Windows?
2009-09-11T00:40:00.000Z	xteejx	sebsebseb	128 and XP, it runs like cr@p :(
2009-09-11T00:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	xteejx	Take the hard disk out, and put in another computer,  I like  frostburn 's suggestion,  however you could also probably do Wubi,  thing is sometimes Wubi goes weird on people
2009-09-11T00:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	xteejx	can you get on the net in Windows?
2009-09-11T00:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	xteejx	also I thought you said USB didn't work?
2009-09-11T00:41:00.000Z	xteejx	sebsebseb	not on the pc no, but have my laptop, and the usb works, but cant boot from it (old bios i guess)
2009-09-11T00:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	xteejx	ok only do Wubi as a last resort
2009-09-11T00:43:00.000Z	xteejx	sebsebseb	I'm a triager I know all that stuff lol is there a way to install that from within windows from usb as the cd? i mean can i just copy the cd to a pen drive and install that way?
2009-09-11T00:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	xteejx	You can install from a USB stick yes
2009-09-11T00:44:00.000Z	xteejx	sebsebseb	with wubi i assume? great i'll get onto it then, thanks for the help :) much appreciated
2009-09-11T00:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	xteejx	I said wubi as a last resort
2009-09-11T00:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	xteejx	since it can go weird on people
2009-09-11T00:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	xteejx	also since it runs from inside Windows
2009-09-11T00:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	xteejx	,but Windows won't be booted
2009-09-11T00:45:00.000Z	xteejx	sebsebseb	sod windo$e ;)
2009-09-11T00:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	xteejx	well then not Wubi
