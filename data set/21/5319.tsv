2007-11-27T09:21:00.000Z	Peddy		does anyone here know how to stop the screen brightness from darkening when I press the quit button?
2007-11-27T09:22:00.000Z	bazhang	Peddy	is that an issue?
2007-11-27T09:23:00.000Z	Peddy	bazhang	what do you mean?
2007-11-27T09:24:00.000Z	bazhang	Peddy	I believe that is the default--why would you want to change it when you are quitting?
2007-11-27T09:24:00.000Z	Peddy	bazhang	because my screen fades very jerkily when I click on it
2007-11-27T09:25:00.000Z	bazhang	Peddy	not sure how to help that.
2007-12-03T09:26:00.000Z	Peddy	bazhang	sorry about that, I actually was only here to check my CPU specs. but that is no excuse for talking about installing a modified version of OSX which I would happily pay for, on a non-apple PC. Sorry again!
2008-04-04T13:37:00.000Z	Peddy	bazhang	are you God?
2008-04-07T12:33:00.000Z	bazhang	Peddy	for gutsy?
2008-04-07T12:34:00.000Z	Peddy	bazhang	correct
2008-04-07T12:34:00.000Z	Peddy	bazhang	is it even possible?
2008-04-18T11:29:00.000Z	bazhang	Peddy	too many tabs open in ff perhaps or an overabundance of extensions in ff
2008-04-18T13:20:00.000Z	bazhang	Peddy	which kernels did you expect? what version are you running now
2008-04-18T13:21:00.000Z	Peddy	bazhang	I was expecting some tuxonice kernels to be listed (as they are in menu.lst), as well as the Ubuntu ones
2008-04-18T13:23:00.000Z	Peddy	bazhang	I suspect an alternate menu.lst is being used, or maybe I need to run a command.
2008-04-18T13:24:00.000Z	bazhang	Peddy	tuxonice? what kernel is that from
2008-04-18T13:24:00.000Z	Peddy	bazhang	its a modified Linux one
2009-07-26T07:59:00.000Z	bazhang	Peddy	then follow ActionParsnip 's suggestion in fixing the configuration
2009-07-26T07:51:00.000Z	bazhang	Peddy	sure
2009-07-26T07:58:00.000Z	bazhang	Peddy	ethernet?
2009-07-26T07:59:00.000Z	Peddy	bazhang	that's not an option, there aren't any phone lines near where I am, router is downstairs, not allowed to run ethernet etc..
