2010-07-28T13:26:00.000Z	Naznaz		I hope somebody can help me so i'll outline my problem in short :)
2010-07-28T13:26:00.000Z	Naznaz		I'm on WLAN at an 16 Mbit connection, and apt download speed is very good about ~1,8 Mb/s
2010-07-28T13:27:00.000Z	Naznaz		But browsing is insanely slow (Firefox and Opera), sites do either load very slowly or i just get an error
2010-07-28T13:27:00.000Z	Naznaz		also tracepath www.google.de aborts after the server of the ISP
2010-07-28T13:27:00.000Z	Naznaz		What can i do? :)
2010-07-28T13:27:00.000Z	Naznaz		no, how?
2010-07-28T13:28:00.000Z	Naznaz		long wait before loading starts (if loading starts)
2010-07-28T13:28:00.000Z	Naznaz		and sometimes a very fast error
2010-07-28T13:28:00.000Z	Naznaz		(but only in opera)
2010-07-28T13:30:00.000Z	Naznaz		but if it's a dns-problem, shouldn't the same problem appear on windows?
2010-07-28T13:31:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Naznaz	Change the settings to ignore IPv6, restart the connection, see if that helps.
2010-07-28T13:33:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Naznaz	Add in another DNS server that's not in your country - like 139.130.4.5
2010-07-28T13:38:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Naznaz	You can also change the MTU to 1500 instead of "automatic" - I find that helps heaps.
2010-07-28T13:57:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Naznaz	Have you made sure you turned off proxy auto-configuration in your web browser?
2010-07-28T13:57:00.000Z	Naznaz	YankDownUnder	yes it's turned off
2010-07-28T13:58:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Naznaz	If everything else works fast (or appears to) - have you tried more than one browser?
2010-07-28T13:58:00.000Z	Naznaz	YankDownUnder	I tried Opera and Firefox
2010-07-28T14:20:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Naznaz	I think you can get away with that.
2010-07-28T14:30:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Naznaz	Workin?
2010-07-28T14:31:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Naznaz	Have you tried, in gconf-editor: /system/http_proxy => check the settings (or delete them)
2010-07-28T14:32:00.000Z	Naznaz	YankDownUnder	thanks I'll try
