2005-07-16T16:21:00.000Z	Madpilot		24hr time can be set easily. My (English Canadian) Ubuntu install displays 24hr time...
2005-07-16T16:21:00.000Z	Tomcat_	Madpilot	Oh yeah... that can be done in the date&time settings.
2005-07-16T16:22:00.000Z	Madpilot	Tomcat_	yup. WTH is "internet time", though?
2005-07-16T16:22:00.000Z	Tomcat_	Madpilot	Something Swatch (from Switzerland) invented... one day = 1000 beats
2005-07-16T16:23:00.000Z	Madpilot	Tomcat_	nikkia: http://www.timeanddate.com/time/internettime.html   <-- this, right?
2005-07-16T16:23:00.000Z	Tomcat_	Madpilot	The only good thing I saw in it was the fact that there's no daylight saving and the same time for everybody on the planet.
2005-07-16T16:23:00.000Z	Madpilot	Tomcat_	that's what ZULU is for. (GMT, whatever...)
2005-07-16T16:23:00.000Z	Tomcat_	Madpilot	Yeah, UTC rocks.
2005-07-16T16:25:00.000Z	Madpilot	Tomcat_	there's always binary clocks, if you want an unreadable clockface...
2005-07-16T16:26:00.000Z	Tomcat_	Madpilot	binary clocks are way more readable than epoch time :)
2005-07-16T16:27:00.000Z	Madpilot	Tomcat_	Unix epoch time just seems incredibly geeky...
2005-07-21T13:47:00.000Z	Tomcat_	Madpilot	Bad strategy - when you want to do something on the console, you hate it so much you'd cut your arms. :)
2005-08-01T13:59:00.000Z	Madpilot	Tomcat_	inkscape & gimp are for different things.
2005-08-12T12:48:00.000Z	Tomcat_	Madpilot	Playing it alone is possible but pointless. :)
2006-03-05T14:41:00.000Z	Madpilot	Tomcat_	Gnome has a weather applet as well, if you don't feel like running gdesklets
2006-03-16T15:29:00.000Z	Madpilot	Tomcat_	it shouldn't - I just had a totem-xine upgrade a few days ago, it went fine
2006-03-16T15:34:00.000Z	Tomcat_	Madpilot	defrysk: I upgraded totem and installed totem-gstreamer, deinstalling totem-xine in the process... however, the new totem-xine package seems to conflict totem and thus wants to uninstall ubuntu-desktop... I'm currently trying if gstreamer can do w32codecs, then I won't need xine anyway.
2006-03-16T15:35:00.000Z	Madpilot	Tomcat_	you don't need ubuntu-desktop
2006-03-16T15:36:00.000Z	Tomcat_	Madpilot	defrysk: I'm just always afraid some update might not work if I don't have it (although that's true only for distro version upgrades)... anyway, totem-gstreamer can do w32codecs now, so I guess I don't need xine anyway.
2006-03-16T15:36:00.000Z	Tomcat_	Madpilot	defrysk: Thanks though ;)
2006-03-16T15:36:00.000Z	Madpilot	Tomcat_	yeah, just be sure and reinstall ubuntu-desktop before you update to Dapper, that's all
