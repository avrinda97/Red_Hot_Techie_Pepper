2008-11-02T11:22:00.000Z	Uplink	jim_p	ttf?

2008-11-02T11:23:00.000Z	jim_p	Uplink	then how will you install it?
2008-11-02T11:23:00.000Z	Uplink	jim_p	using package manager?
2008-11-02T11:24:00.000Z	jim_p	Uplink	show me that font somewhere
2008-11-02T11:25:00.000Z	Uplink	jim_p	i remember someone telling me how to install fonts from apt-get but i forgot the command
2008-11-02T11:25:00.000Z	jim_p	Uplink	name the font again
2008-11-02T11:27:00.000Z	Uplink	jim_p	its segoe UI
2008-11-02T11:31:00.000Z	jim_p	Uplink	there is no segoe font in apt!
2008-11-02T11:31:00.000Z	Uplink	jim_p	try terminus
2008-11-02T11:32:00.000Z	jim_p	Uplink	is it segoe or terminus you want? because they are fonts for different apps
2008-11-02T11:32:00.000Z	Uplink	jim_p	i got terminus already, thats how i got it... it was like apt-get ubuntu-font-terminus
2008-11-02T11:33:00.000Z	Uplink	jim_p	something like that, i cant remember the command
2008-11-02T11:34:00.000Z	jim_p	Uplink	terminus is in synaptic because its an opensource font. segoe cant be in there because its an ms font from vista
2008-11-02T11:34:00.000Z	Uplink	jim_p	ooh i see
2008-11-02T11:34:00.000Z	Uplink	jim_p	well thanx bud. i'll have to bend to see which other i like
