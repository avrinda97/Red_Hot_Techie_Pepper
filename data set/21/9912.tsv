2005-06-19T05:21:00.000Z	Aegr		yup
2005-06-19T05:23:00.000Z	Aegr		is it possible for a DVD writer to no support DMA? "sudo hdparm -d1 /dev/hdc" gives me "HDIO_SET_DMA failed: Operation not permitted"
2005-06-19T05:25:00.000Z	GazaM	Aegr	what cpu do you use?
2005-06-19T05:25:00.000Z	Aegr		AMD sempron
2005-06-19T05:26:00.000Z	Aegr		can it be set via proc?
2005-06-19T05:26:00.000Z	GazaM		Ok, so what chipset do you have on the motherboard, VIA? Or do you have an nForce motherboard
2005-06-19T05:26:00.000Z	Aegr		"sudo cat /proc/ide/hdc/settings" has using_dma in the list
2005-06-19T05:27:00.000Z	Aegr		via I think
2005-06-19T05:27:00.000Z	Aegr		must be VIA
2005-06-19T05:27:00.000Z	GazaM	Aegr	there is a module which you have to put at the top of /etc/modules in order to be able to setup dma
2005-06-19T05:27:00.000Z	GazaM		I have an nForce with AMD and must put amd74xx at the top, I'll check for VIA now
2005-06-19T05:28:00.000Z	Aegr		great thanks
2005-06-19T05:29:00.000Z	GazaM	Aegr	put this module at the top
2005-06-19T05:29:00.000Z	GazaM		via82cxxx
2005-06-19T05:29:00.000Z	GazaM		Got that?
2005-06-19T05:29:00.000Z	Aegr		according to lsmod that is loaded
2005-06-19T05:29:00.000Z	GazaM		sudo gedit /etc/modules
2005-06-19T05:30:00.000Z	GazaM	Aegr	is via82cxxx in /etc/modules
2005-06-19T05:30:00.000Z	Aegr		how do you change settings via proc?
2005-06-19T05:30:00.000Z	GazaM		specifically at the top of the list
2005-06-19T05:31:00.000Z	Aegr	GazaM	no it isn't but it is listed in lsmod
