2006-05-22T13:46:00.000Z	richiefrich	yan	like this
2006-05-22T13:47:00.000Z	richiefrich	yan	 ~/.wine/drive_c/
2006-05-22T13:48:00.000Z	richiefrich	yan	and it's emulated so u cant use your windows dir like that
2006-05-22T13:53:00.000Z	yan	richiefrich	ok. that means that i have to put exactly what you wrote? or ../drive_c? or /home/yan/.wine/drive_c?
