2005-04-08T05:49:00.000Z	len		hiya, any advice on where to put a partition that will be a music folder, other than /home
2005-04-08T05:49:00.000Z	apokryphos	len	why not /home?
2005-04-08T05:49:00.000Z	apokryphos	len	/media is good
2005-04-08T05:50:00.000Z	len	apokryphos	i have home for downloads and temp tv shows and photo's
2005-04-08T05:51:00.000Z	len	apokryphos	i was thinking /mnt or /opt  those alright?
2005-04-08T05:51:00.000Z	apokryphos	len	your /home should be all of *your* stuff, which essentially includes Music, but it's up to you. You can mount it on a subdirectory of /home, but it's completely up to you. You could use /media
2005-04-08T05:51:00.000Z	apokryphos	len	either are fine; /mnt is more Mandrake style though ;)
2005-04-08T05:52:00.000Z	len	apokryphos	i already put a mount on /home, perhaps i should have made that partion super big instead of making three partitions.  dang.
2005-04-08T05:53:00.000Z	apokryphos	len	You should, ideally, have three in all: /, /home and /swap
2005-04-08T05:53:00.000Z	apokryphos	len	you can still mount something as a subdirectory of /home
2005-04-08T05:54:00.000Z	apokryphos	len	i.e. /home/music
2005-04-08T05:54:00.000Z	apokryphos		*swap, no / ;)
2005-04-08T05:55:00.000Z	len	apokryphos	i see; also, the partition i want to move, is located on /temp, will that break anything if i move it?
2005-04-08T05:55:00.000Z	apokryphos	len	nope, just change the mount point.
2005-04-08T05:56:00.000Z	len	apokryphos	ok, thanks, here goes, i think i will try and make a sub partitoin like u suggested
2005-04-08T05:58:00.000Z	len	apokryphos	i was going to use the ubuntu install disk to do this, then quit after re- partitioning, is this the easiest way?
2005-04-08T05:58:00.000Z	apokryphos	len	sorry, Internet d/c. Would have missed any other comments...
2005-04-08T05:58:00.000Z	len	apokryphos	i was going to use the ubuntu install disk to do this, then quit after re- partitioning, is this the easiest way?
2005-04-08T05:59:00.000Z	apokryphos	len	certainly not the easiset way. You can edit your fstab and just change the mount point there
2005-04-08T06:00:00.000Z	len	apokryphos	ahhh, i didn't think of that.. that sounds much more easier
2005-04-08T06:00:00.000Z	len	apokryphos	ty
