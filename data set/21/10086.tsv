2009-10-31T02:53:00.000Z	tim		having trouble with my broadcom wireless card after installing 9.10 x64
2009-10-31T02:53:00.000Z	tim		the proprietary drivers no longer show up
2009-10-31T02:54:00.000Z	poet	tim	what's the chipset?
2009-10-31T02:55:00.000Z	tim	poet	ummm broadcom.....
2009-10-31T02:55:00.000Z	tim	poet	how can i check?
2009-10-31T02:56:00.000Z	poet	tim	lspci -n | grep '14e4:43'
2009-10-31T02:56:00.000Z	tim	poet	Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4311 802.11b/g WLAN (rev 02)
2009-10-31T02:58:00.000Z	tim	poet	tim@tim:~$ lspci -n | grep '14e4:43'
2009-10-31T02:58:00.000Z	poet	tim	yeah thats the 4311, not sure why the non-free driver isn;t showing up :/
2009-10-31T02:59:00.000Z	tim	poet	i have rebooted a few times, nothing
2009-10-31T03:00:00.000Z	poet	tim	this might be a confirmed bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/421095
2009-10-31T03:08:00.000Z	tim	poet	it was flawless in 9.04
2009-10-31T03:02:00.000Z	tim	poet	so its a regression from 9.04 then?
2009-10-31T03:02:00.000Z	poet	tim	looks like there are a couple open bugs related to broadcom 4311 on launchpad, so possibly.  maybe make a post on the forum?
2009-10-31T03:03:00.000Z	tim	poet	yeh there is a post on the forum already, someone on there just rebooted over and over, eventually, the drivers appeared
2009-10-31T03:05:00.000Z	tim	poet	do you know if the ath5k drivers are working yet? i have an atheros card sitting around which i originally swapped for this broadcom one because ath5k was so unreliable
2009-10-31T03:06:00.000Z	poet	tim	your best bet is probably going to be to stick with the broadcom.  the non-free drivers are known to work, there is just some kind of configuration/detection issue.  You could always download the drivers from broadcom's website and install manually
2009-10-31T03:07:00.000Z	tim	poet	i might give that a try then
2009-10-31T03:07:00.000Z	poet	tim	I used to have a broadcom, I know how much of a pain they can be :-p
2009-10-31T03:09:00.000Z	poet	tim	oh interesting.  The last time I ran it was 8.04 I think.  Hope you get it fixed soon :)
2009-10-31T03:23:00.000Z	tim	poet	for next time http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1304845
