2008-10-14T01:34:00.000Z	lonforce		woa fluxbox is faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaast ....!!!
2008-10-14T01:34:00.000Z	lonforce		can I install cairo-dock or something similar on fluxbox?
2008-10-14T01:35:00.000Z	dr_willis	lonforce	 some of those docks require a 'compositing' window manager.. those may not work with fluxbox.. others might.. try it and see
2008-10-14T01:36:00.000Z	lonforce	dr_willis	it's just the right clicking thing to open the application is too difficult for me... another thing, how can I install themes in fluxbox?
2008-10-14T01:37:00.000Z	dr_willis	lonforce	 err... thats statement makes ya sound rather.. pathic. :) too hard to right click? 90% of the window managers for linux/X use the right click method..   its kde and gnome that sort of started the whole 'start button' thing..  Fluxbox has its own themes. and you could just run the gnome-panel in fluxbox if you want the gnome panel.
2008-10-14T01:38:00.000Z	lonforce	dr_willis	okok...guess I'll just get used to it, thanks anyway
2008-10-14T01:38:00.000Z	dr_willis	lonforce	 you can easially just use fluxbox to replace the gnome window manager part. :) or the kde window manager if ya like. The fluxbox homepage proberly has 1000+ themes for the thing as well.
2008-10-14T01:40:00.000Z	lonforce	dr_willis	ok thx! Just found a nice one...
2008-10-14T02:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	lonforce	 nautilus took over the desktop, and the 'root menu'   - you can start nautilus with some optuions where it does not do that.
2008-10-14T02:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	lonforce	 use nautilus --no-desktop         i belive
2008-10-14T02:05:00.000Z	lonforce	dr_willis	hehe, I don't get it anymore, so all these window manager coexist somehow in the same session?
2008-10-14T02:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	lonforce	 its like 'legos' different software blocks stacking together to build up the whole interface.
2008-10-14T02:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	lonforce	 fluxbox is a 'window manager' thats it.. :) gnome uses metacity as its widnow maanger, to do the basic stuff then nautilus does the 'desktop' and other features
2008-10-14T02:07:00.000Z	lonforce	dr_willis	thats cool tnx! Just right now I also managed to close the menubar... All I got now is xchat and the wallpaper, how can I restart? :)
2008-10-14T02:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	lonforce	 if you run 'gnome-panel' you will have the gnome panel, on top of the fluxbox window manager
2008-10-14T02:07:00.000Z	lonforce	dr_willis	ah cool, but will the great performance stay even mit the gnome-panel on?
2008-10-14T02:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	lonforce	 you can make your own .Xsession and customize exactly what gets ran.. but then the job is yours ot make sure they all play nicely
2008-10-14T02:08:00.000Z	dr_willis	lonforce	 ive never noticed that much preformace differances. :)  the more apps you run the more load on the system..  use what you like.. turn off what you dont want
2008-10-14T02:09:00.000Z	lonforce	dr_willis	ok, I just managed to do some over custimization ... how can I reset fluxbox?
2008-10-14T02:10:00.000Z	lonforce	dr_willis	ah ok got it !! thanks man you have been a great help, I'll go to sleep now, have a nice evening or day where ever you live...
2008-10-14T02:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	lonforce	 log out/back in perahs?
