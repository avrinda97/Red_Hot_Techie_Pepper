2008-08-15T07:40:00.000Z	dmsuperman		So how can I configure mpd and orangeplayer (or any other such web-based mpd client) to work together?
2008-08-15T07:40:00.000Z	dmsuperman		Googling isn't resulting in much help
2008-08-15T07:40:00.000Z	Gnea	dmsuperman	what did you search for?
2008-08-15T07:41:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Gnea	even just "orangeplayer mpd" doesn't return anything
2008-08-15T07:42:00.000Z	Gnea	dmsuperman	try without the quotes and add 'ubuntu'
2008-08-15T07:42:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Gnea	just a bunch of random asian sites
2008-08-15T07:43:00.000Z	Gnea	dmsuperman	change your language
2008-08-15T07:44:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Gnea	it's english

2008-08-15T07:45:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Gnea	right, none of those are relevant
2008-08-15T07:45:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Gnea	that's exactly what i searched for

2008-08-15T07:48:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Gnea	...I'm trying to figure out how to configure mpd + orangeplayer
2008-08-15T07:48:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Gnea	not file a bug report
2008-08-15T07:49:00.000Z	Gnea	dmsuperman	you know, i've never used them, so I don't know.. I'm just trying to help troubleshoot it... that bug report says it won't work because of pulseaudio... so I didn't know if you'd checked that or not
2008-08-15T07:50:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Gnea	It's not an issue of "not working", it's an issue of "not yet configured". I appreciate the help, but I think this needs more help from somebody who's actually set it up
2008-08-15T07:51:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Gnea	plus, I'm in gutsy, precisely for that reason :P
2008-08-15T07:54:00.000Z	Gnea	dmsuperman	yeah, i can't seem to find orangeplayer in hardy at all :P
2008-08-15T07:54:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Gnea	it's a PHP script/client
2008-08-15T07:55:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Gnea	it's not in repos
2008-08-15T07:55:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Gnea	it's for use with mpd
