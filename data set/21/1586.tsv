2011-04-21T23:03:00.000Z	antivirtel		hi! I'm looking for some help in bash programming. How to rename a lots of files(eg: 0062af22.mp3 to music22.mp3) with a simple scipt?
2011-04-21T23:04:00.000Z	tensorpudding	antivirtel	you can rename using regular expressions using rename
2011-04-21T23:05:00.000Z	antivirtel	tensorpudding	sure, thanks, but I dont really know how does it work in renaming... can you describe it?
2011-04-21T23:07:00.000Z	tensorpudding	antivirtel	you supply a regular expression which it matches filenames on, and what to substitute it with, and a list of files, and it does the rest
2011-04-21T23:08:00.000Z	tensorpudding	antivirtel	e.g. rename 's/\.exe$//' foo.exe bar.exe baz.exe, will strip off the .exe from the filenames
2011-04-21T23:09:00.000Z	tensorpudding	antivirtel	so what is the format of the files you want to rename?
2011-04-21T23:10:00.000Z	antivirtel	tensorpudding	ahham, yeah, I know "mv", but I have these files: 0062af01.mp3, 0062af02.mp3, ..., 0062af25.mp3;(I want to change it to TEXT01.mp3, TEXT02.mp3, ...) can you help me in regexp?
2011-04-21T23:10:00.000Z	tensorpudding	antivirtel	what is TEXT01
2011-04-21T23:10:00.000Z	antivirtel		it is only a new name
2011-04-21T23:10:00.000Z	tensorpudding	antivirtel	is it unique to every file? there isn't really an easy way to do that, if so
2011-04-21T23:10:00.000Z	antivirtel	tensorpudding	I want to keep the number only
2011-04-21T23:11:00.000Z	tensorpudding	antivirtel	but if you just want to substitute 0062af with TEXT, then rename 's/0062af/TEXT/' *.mp3
2011-04-21T23:12:00.000Z	antivirtel		hmm thanks Pici tensorpudding ! and what does "s" mean in the regexp?
2011-04-21T23:12:00.000Z	tensorpudding		the s isn't part of the regex
2011-04-21T23:12:00.000Z	tensorpudding		the s means "substitute"
2011-04-21T23:12:00.000Z	antivirtel	tensorpudding	ahh.. thanks
2011-04-21T23:13:00.000Z	tensorpudding		it finds matches on the first regex, and replaces them with the second regex
2011-04-21T23:14:00.000Z	antivirtel		and an other question tensorpudding, I use id3v2 to change MP3 ID3 tags... these numbers are the track numbers, how can I use it in id3v2? (eg. id3v2 -n 25 TEXT25.mp3)
2011-04-21T23:14:00.000Z	antivirtel	tensorpudding	I want to change it at once, with I loop :D
2011-04-21T23:15:00.000Z	tensorpudding		if you want to do mass-retagging through regular expressions, you can come up with a bash expression, but i'd suggest using ex falso instead
2011-04-21T23:16:00.000Z	antivirtel	tensorpudding	ok, I look for "ex falso"
