2012-03-31T13:33:00.000Z	Myrtti	gask8er	what are you trying to install?
2012-03-31T13:34:00.000Z	Myrtti	gask8er	which webcam is this?
2012-03-31T13:35:00.000Z	Myrtti	gask8er	why, no.
2012-03-31T13:35:00.000Z	Myrtti	gask8er	which webcam do you have?
2012-03-31T13:35:00.000Z	Myrtti	gask8er	judging from the filename you might already have the drivers
2012-03-31T13:36:00.000Z	Myrtti	gask8er	you don't need to install them that way
2012-03-31T13:38:00.000Z	Myrtti	gask8er	which version of Ubuntu are you on?
2012-03-31T14:04:00.000Z	Myrtti	gask8er	no, you don't.
2012-03-31T14:06:00.000Z	Myrtti	gask8er	which tutorial are you reading?
2012-03-31T14:06:00.000Z	Myrtti	gask8er	the tuxfiles one?
2012-03-31T14:08:00.000Z	Myrtti	gask8er	well I still claim that you don't need to compile the drivers yourself, I don't know where you got the idea - I think the problem might be with the fact that the camera firmware is somewhat dependant on Windows or Windows sets some setting in it the wrong way.
2012-03-31T14:08:00.000Z	Myrtti	gask8er	you're in terminal, right?
2012-03-31T14:09:00.000Z	Myrtti	gask8er	please do "sudo apt-get install pastebinit;sudo lshw | pastebinit
2012-03-31T14:09:00.000Z	Myrtti	gask8er	then paste the url that was produced
2012-03-31T14:12:00.000Z	Myrtti	gask8er	which command?
2012-03-31T14:15:00.000Z	Myrtti	gask8er	I don't think that's a driver problem then
