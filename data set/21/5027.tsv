2012-09-20T01:08:00.000Z	subcool	jrib	have u even been paying attention?
2012-09-20T01:08:00.000Z	jrib	subcool	no, that's the point.
2012-09-20T01:09:00.000Z	jrib	subcool	it's better to just repeat your question after a reasonable amount of time if no one can help you.  You're more likely to get help that way.  Some people may have just joined and have no clue about what you are talking about
2012-09-20T01:10:00.000Z	subcool	jrib	its better to ask = what r u having issues with, not send an ubottu bot after me because ur not paying attention.
2012-09-20T01:11:00.000Z	subcool	jrib	i've been working llutz and TJ- on my issue for a WHILE - im not going to just rudely pretend they arent helping and ask someone else for new help. Im just saying if anyone else that is listen has an idea... to chime in.
