2006-04-10T15:34:00.000Z	cge	Frogzoo	you mean as opposed to Dapper?
2006-04-10T15:35:00.000Z	Frogzoo	cge	I can't go to Dapper, as this is my work machine, but I would really like to get ie6 working (don't ask)
2006-04-10T15:36:00.000Z	cge	Frogzoo	I understand. With Dapper I have used the winehq repository, have you tried those?
2006-04-10T15:36:00.000Z	cge	Frogzoo	they aren't dapper specific.
2006-04-10T15:37:00.000Z	Frogzoo	cge	the wierd thing is I had ie6 working under both the ubuntu stock wine & 9.11, but since installing/uninstalling prelink - no joy, not sure if prelink's the culprit, but there's something stuck which the package manager isn't cleaning out
2006-04-10T15:38:00.000Z	cge	Frogzoo	hmmm... I'm not sure if removing prelink removes the prelinking.
2006-04-10T15:38:00.000Z	Frogzoo	cge	so I'm guessing there's a bug somewhere & I'd really prefer to track it down, but if I can't get this fixed I'm going to have to reinstall
2006-04-10T15:38:00.000Z	Frogzoo	cge	you rerun the cronjob & it's supposed to remove it, or that's my understanding
2006-04-10T15:40:00.000Z	cge	Frogzoo	there's a cron job for prelink!? And I was manually doing prelink -a all this time.
2006-04-10T15:41:00.000Z	Frogzoo	cge	there's not only a cronjob in cron.daily, but if you add "DPkg::Post-Invoke {"echo Running prelink, please wait...;/etc/cron.daily/prelink";}"  to /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/30prelink , then apt will rerun prelink anytime you add new pkgs
2006-04-10T15:44:00.000Z	cge	Frogzoo	amazing progress!
2006-04-10T15:44:00.000Z	Frogzoo	cge	well it's nice, until you try to install kde, & then it's the suxors :)
2006-04-10T15:46:00.000Z	Frogzoo	cge	so are you running wine successfully AND are prelinking?
2006-04-10T15:46:00.000Z	cge	Frogzoo	yes.
2006-04-10T15:48:00.000Z	Frogzoo	cge	if it's not a rude question, which doze apps? ie6 for instance? WoW? etc - also which verion wine & did you use winetools or sidenet for setup?
2006-04-10T15:48:00.000Z	cge	Frogzoo	nothing, really, besides trivial apps.
2006-04-10T15:48:00.000Z	cge	Frogzoo	but no, I just used the winehq repository, and the automatic setup.
2006-04-10T15:49:00.000Z	Frogzoo	cge	which automatic setup? winetools?
2006-04-10T15:50:00.000Z	cge	Frogzoo	not sure. wine automatically sets up .wine when running it for the first time. I haven't used winetools in a long time.
2006-04-10T15:50:00.000Z	Frogzoo	cge	thx that helps narrow it down
2006-04-10T15:52:00.000Z	Frogzoo	cge	yes, confusing
