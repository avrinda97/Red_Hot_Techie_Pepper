2009-09-24T20:49:00.000Z	ed0n0n		Something eats my disk space in Jackalope, I boot with 60Gb free space and I already have just 9Gb free, I am just editing text files and not using any large file, but it happens anyway... Why could this happen?
2009-09-24T20:49:00.000Z	Halitech	ed0n0n	what does df -h show you?
2009-09-24T20:51:00.000Z	Halitech	ed0n0n	df -h should show where the space is being used
2009-09-24T20:51:00.000Z	ed0n0n	Halitech	It happens with /dev/sda2
2009-09-24T20:51:00.000Z	Halitech	ed0n0n	where is /dev/sda2 mounted?
2009-09-24T20:52:00.000Z	Halitech	ed0n0n	ok, just as a guess, do df -h /var
2009-09-24T20:53:00.000Z	ed0n0n	Halitech	/dev/sda2              83G   75G  4,5G  95% /
2009-09-24T20:53:00.000Z	ed0n0n	Halitech	so some kind of logs can eat so much space?
2009-09-24T20:53:00.000Z	Halitech	ed0n0n	yup, use natilus to go into the logs folder and see which one is getting big
2009-09-24T20:54:00.000Z	Halitech	ed0n0n	or ls -l /var/log
2009-09-24T20:55:00.000Z	ed0n0n	Halitech	/var/log is not using more than Mb, not Gb, so it doesnt seem to be the cause
2009-09-24T20:56:00.000Z	ed0n0n	Halitech	/var/ is using 1.7 Gb
2009-09-24T20:56:00.000Z	Halitech	ed0n0n	ok, use the same command ls -l /var and see if any large files show up there
2009-09-24T20:58:00.000Z	Halitech	ed0n0n	still, 1.7gig is alot in /var unless you have a website running out of there
2009-09-24T20:58:00.000Z	ed0n0n	Halitech	/var/ is  Ok
2009-09-24T20:59:00.000Z	Halitech	ed0n0n	ok, well only guess is to start looking at individual directories then and see ... there is an app that will show you in a graph but I can't think of the name right now ... disk usage analysis maybe?
2009-09-24T21:03:00.000Z	ed0n0n	Halitech	I read this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=7991873 and now I think it may be that I created a symlink to another ntfs partition, could that be doing something wierd?
2009-09-24T21:05:00.000Z	Halitech	ed0n0n	not sure, it could
2009-09-24T21:06:00.000Z	ed0n0n	Halitech	I have 97% used... while chatting soon I will need to reboot, this is serious. Help me users
2009-09-24T21:07:00.000Z	Halitech	ed0n0n	when you reboot the space frees up?
2009-09-24T21:08:00.000Z	Halitech	ed0n0n	reboot and immediately open a terminal and run dmesg | tail and see if it gives any clues
