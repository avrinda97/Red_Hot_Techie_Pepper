2008-09-25T20:27:00.000Z	Some_Person	indian_munnda	Do you have Ubuntu 32-bit or Ubuntu 64-bit?
2008-09-25T20:27:00.000Z	indian_munnda	Some_Person	i have ubuntu lts
2008-09-25T20:27:00.000Z	Some_Person	indian_munnda	LTS means Long Term Support, has nothing to do with edition
2008-09-25T20:28:00.000Z	Some_Person	indian_munnda	Did you originally download the regular CD or the 64-bit CD?
2008-09-25T20:28:00.000Z	indian_munnda	Some_Person	actually i have installed PC version and its not 64 bit pc.
2008-09-25T20:28:00.000Z	Some_Person	indian_munnda	Then you need 32-bit
2008-09-25T20:29:00.000Z	indian_munnda	Some_Person	ok thank u dude
2008-09-25T20:32:00.000Z	indian_munnda	Some_Person	have ever used nero in ubuntu.
2008-09-25T20:33:00.000Z	Some_Person	indian_munnda	A long time ago
2008-09-25T20:33:00.000Z	Some_Person	indian_munnda	Before I started using free tools
2008-09-25T20:33:00.000Z	Some_Person	indian_munnda	Nero for Linux is a waste of money IMHO
2008-09-25T20:34:00.000Z	indian_munnda	Some_Person	i m downloading a trail version right now, is it available free also in any repository?
2008-09-25T20:34:00.000Z	Some_Person	indian_munnda	Nero is commercial proprietary software.
2008-09-25T20:34:00.000Z	Some_Person	indian_munnda	It is not available for free (except with the trial version)
2008-09-25T20:35:00.000Z	Some_Person	indian_munnda	GnomeBaker and that other thing that comes with Ubuntu are free and IMHO just as good
2008-09-25T20:36:00.000Z	indian_munnda	Some_Person	according to u which is the most user friendly one for burning files?
2008-09-25T20:36:00.000Z	Some_Person	indian_munnda	they
2008-09-25T20:36:00.000Z	Some_Person	indian_munnda	they're not really that much different
2008-09-25T20:42:00.000Z	indian_munnda	Some_Person	to which repository IMHO belongs ??
