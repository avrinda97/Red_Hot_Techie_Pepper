2008-02-19T19:29:00.000Z	Arelis__	white_eagle_	Were you the one helping me yesterday/the day before yesterday with the instability issue?
2008-02-19T19:29:00.000Z	white_eagle_	Arelis__	yeah
2008-02-19T19:30:00.000Z	Arelis__	white_eagle_	Great :). I've been running the liveCD for a night to backup something, and nothing has crashed. So.. can it be the harddrive?
2008-02-19T19:30:00.000Z	Arelis__	white_eagle_	(And, no..)
2008-02-19T19:32:00.000Z	Arelis__	white_eagle_	Has your system been stable?
2008-02-19T19:45:00.000Z	white_eagle_	Arelis__	what is the problem now?
2008-02-19T19:45:00.000Z	Arelis__	white_eagle_	Well, i want to try installing Ubuntu on a better harddrive so i can see if it is more stable on there, but i don't want to lose my Windows installation.
2008-02-19T19:45:00.000Z	Arelis__	white_eagle_	on what device?
2008-02-19T19:46:00.000Z	Arelis__	white_eagle_	not a partition?
2008-02-19T19:49:00.000Z	Arelis__	white_eagle_	Oh, wait a minute, i forgot i cleared the "faulty" harddrive and put a single NTFS partition on that. Should i still do an fsck?
2008-02-19T19:50:00.000Z	white_eagle_	Arelis__	hmmmm
2008-02-19T19:52:00.000Z	Arelis__	white_eagle_	That's very nice of you :), i'll ask someone else then
2008-02-19T20:09:00.000Z	white_eagle_	Arelis__	its the contrary
2008-02-19T20:09:00.000Z	Arelis__	white_eagle_	No. Sorry, but AIGLX and XGL are for effects, and GLX is for games
2008-02-19T20:09:00.000Z	white_eagle_	Arelis__	oh all that XGL, blah blah, GLX
2008-02-19T20:10:00.000Z	Arelis__	white_eagle_	yeah, 'tis confusing :)
