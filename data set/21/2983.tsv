2009-05-01T08:19:00.000Z	frenzy_usa	gartral_	a default install should have everything you need. Look at this page to get started http://www.howtoforge.com/configure-remote-access-to-your-ubuntu-desktop
2009-05-01T08:39:00.000Z	frenzy_usa	gartral_	tested*
2009-05-01T08:25:00.000Z	gartral_	frenzy_usa	ok, how do i configure remote desktop settings through termian (SSH)
2009-05-01T08:26:00.000Z	frenzy_usa	gartral_	Don't know since I never used/heard of termian before.
2009-05-01T08:28:00.000Z	gartral_	frenzy_usa	terminal* excuse me
2009-05-01T08:29:00.000Z	frenzy_usa	gartral_	You want to run the Remote Desktop session through SSH for security?
2009-05-01T08:33:00.000Z	gartral_	frenzy_usa	no, i would like to set up my access prefrences through SSH cause my desktop is 25 miles to the west...
2009-05-01T08:34:00.000Z	frenzy_usa	gartral_	So you are not at the computer you want remote access to?
2009-05-01T08:35:00.000Z	gartral_	frenzy_usa	you are correct
2009-05-01T08:35:00.000Z	gartral_	frenzy_usa	im using ssh now to connect and use irssi
2009-05-01T08:37:00.000Z	frenzy_usa	gartral_	You currently have an SSH connection to the desktop, you now would like GUI access to the desktop. Is that correct?
2009-05-01T08:37:00.000Z	gartral_	frenzy_usa	that is correct
2009-05-01T08:39:00.000Z	frenzy_usa	gartral_	I have not test this command. Try this command: 'gconftool-2 -s -t bool /desktop/gnome/remote_access/enabled true'. Taken from http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=262376
2009-05-01T08:44:00.000Z	gartral_	frenzy_usa	it appears to have worked
2009-05-01T08:45:00.000Z	gartral_	frenzy_usa	how do i log in?
2009-05-01T08:47:00.000Z	frenzy_usa	gartral_	This file appears to have the info you need to setup an SSH tunnel for remote desktop.  http://www.mydemosite.org/Ubuntu-Remote-Desktop-Guide.pdf
2009-05-01T08:47:00.000Z	gartral_	frenzy_usa	i dont need the tunneling (yet) i just want to log in on a rdesktop session
2009-05-01T08:51:00.000Z	frenzy_usa	gartral_	Ok.  I've always run everything through an SSH tunnel so not sure what all you'll need to do.  But you'll need VNC on the local computer and probably need setup port forwarding one or both of the routers.
2009-05-01T08:51:00.000Z	gartral_	frenzy_usa	thats fine, i have VNC and everything is setup locally, ill go hame and work on it
