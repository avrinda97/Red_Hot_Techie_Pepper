2012-02-29T21:38:00.000Z	azertyu		for a better visibility i simply would like to color each lines into different color when i m doing cat text.file
2012-02-29T21:39:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	azertyu	 you mean in bash?
2012-02-29T21:40:00.000Z	azertyu	MonkeyDust	?
2012-02-29T21:41:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	azertyu	 where do you want colored lines?
2012-02-29T21:42:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	azertyu	 cat does not have that option
2012-02-29T21:44:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	azertyu	 you can write a bash script and use color variables
2012-04-01T15:39:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	azertyu	 create a folder with an easy name, then type sudo mount [device] [that name]
2012-04-01T15:40:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	azertyu	 don't change, just make up a name
2012-04-01T15:45:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	azertyu	 in a Terminal, type sudo fdisk -l|pastebinit -- paste the url here so the channel can see and help
2012-04-01T15:49:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	azertyu	 i'm not familiar with hfsplus, what is it?
2012-04-01T15:51:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	azertyu	 "HFS+ fsck and mkfs have been ported to Linux and are part of the hfsprogs package." -- i'd say: install hfsprogs, first
2012-04-01T15:52:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	azertyu	 hfsprogs is in the repos, you can use apt-get, synaptic or the software center
