2007-01-02T07:54:00.000Z	kaoz		hello ubuntu
2007-01-02T07:55:00.000Z	kaoz		can someone please help me with some modem problems i am having?
2007-01-02T07:55:00.000Z	kaoz		anyone know anything about programming.... compiling or pctel modems?
2007-01-02T07:56:00.000Z	kaoz		for some reason my makefile for compiling my drivers is giving me errors and the module wont load... any ideas
2007-01-02T07:57:00.000Z	SilentDis	kaoz	 what errors?
2007-01-02T07:58:00.000Z	SilentDis	kaoz	you'll need to tell me what error you got.  I MIGHT have a solution then ;)
2007-01-02T08:03:00.000Z	SilentDis	kaoz	do a less <name of makefile>.  i'm gonna bet that first line reads #!/bin/sh, doesn't in ;)
2007-01-02T08:03:00.000Z	SilentDis	kaoz	less is the name of a program.  type "less <name of makefile>", without the quotes :)
2007-01-02T08:05:00.000Z	SilentDis	kaoz	ok, what does the first line say?
2007-01-02T08:08:00.000Z	SilentDis	kaoz	oops, wrong file.  i assume the file you're running to get that error is called "make", right?
2007-01-02T08:08:00.000Z	SilentDis	kaoz	the command you want to run is "less make", so we can read it :)
2007-01-02T08:09:00.000Z	SilentDis	kaoz	ok, then it'll be "less makefile" (without quotes, of course)
2007-01-02T08:09:00.000Z	SilentDis	kaoz	and I only need the first line of text :)
2007-01-02T08:12:00.000Z	SilentDis	kaoz	hmm... you're running dapper I assume, on an i386 kernel?  that script looks VERY custom to a very particular install
2007-01-02T08:13:00.000Z	SilentDis	kaoz	are you running edgy?  just looking at it doesn't look like it'll do all that great for you is all.
2007-01-02T08:15:00.000Z	SilentDis	kaoz	from what I can tell from that script, it'll only work on 2.6.15-26-368 kernel.  type uname -r, and show us the output please :)
2007-01-02T08:18:00.000Z	SilentDis	kaoz	ok, you are running it all correctly (i assume there was a step you did BEFORE that actually created that makefile then, no worries).  it looks like they have a FAQ file included with those drivers, and in that file they have a 'dedicated' support forum for help with it.
2007-01-02T08:30:00.000Z	SilentDis	kaoz	cool, what was wrong?
2007-01-02T08:31:00.000Z	SilentDis	kaoz	i think you might do best with either the help forums they setup (check that FAQ), or someone else.  I've never used that modem before, so I won't know how to best help you from here out
2007-01-02T08:32:00.000Z	SilentDis	kaoz	could be permissions.  sudo <command>.  outside that, I can't say, sorry :(
2007-01-07T06:15:00.000Z	SilentDis	kaoz	I know as much as ubotu knows on that one, sorry :(
