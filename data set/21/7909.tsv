2007-07-11T16:56:00.000Z	sysop		is there an easy FTP server with a gui in ubuntu?
2007-07-11T16:57:00.000Z	sysop		cheers snow
2007-07-11T16:57:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sysop	good place to start is synaptic and search for ftp server
2008-01-20T19:40:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sysop	Not one I have ever seen.. Any unusual sources or addons?
2008-01-20T19:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sysop	Like I said, I have never seen that problem.. and my only thought was some odd repo was giving you a bad list?  If you rem out all but the basic repos and refresh dos it still have the bug?
2008-01-20T19:44:00.000Z	sysop	Jack_Sparrow	What do you mean by basic repo? I have not done anything with repo's yet???
2008-01-20T19:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sysop	If you have not touched any repos then I am really at a loss about that problem
2008-01-20T19:45:00.000Z	sysop	Jack_Sparrow	Should I submit this as a bug to ubuntu???
2008-01-20T19:46:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sysop	If you have a clean system and get that error yes, but make sure they know which sun you added from where in the report
2008-01-20T19:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sysop	Pastebin your sources.list for us.. just for fun..
2008-01-20T19:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sysop	I dont have the url handy
2008-01-20T19:48:00.000Z	sysop	Jack_Sparrow	where do I find the sources list?
2008-01-20T19:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sysop	gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
2008-01-20T19:50:00.000Z	sysop	Jack_Sparrow	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/52781/
2008-01-20T19:52:00.000Z	sysop	Jack_Sparrow	could Virtual Box be the cause?
2008-01-20T19:54:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sysop	I was going to ask you about that...
2008-01-20T19:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sysop	Rem out that source line and reload.. as was my first thought
2008-01-20T19:56:00.000Z	sysop	Jack_Sparrow	but then I wolnt get VBox updates right???
2008-01-20T19:57:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sysop	You can ask in #vbox about the updates for that...
2008-01-20T19:58:00.000Z	sysop	Jack_Sparrow	OK, I can rem the line for now
2008-01-20T19:59:00.000Z	sysop	Jack_Sparrow	bhazang: thanks!
