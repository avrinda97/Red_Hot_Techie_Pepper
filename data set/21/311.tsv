2012-06-06T09:56:00.000Z	sddhrthrt	Dr_Willis	i'm sure it's not.

2012-06-06T09:59:00.000Z	sddhrthrt	Dr_Willis	oh yeah. you are right about that. so when i use the synaptic gui and install, it installs!
2012-06-06T10:00:00.000Z	sddhrthrt	Dr_Willis	well, you must be new to linux then :D they are python package managers

2012-06-06T10:01:00.000Z	sddhrthrt	Dr_Willis	well, the last time i saw, apt-get and pip fetched proxy from the system settings
2012-06-06T10:01:00.000Z	sddhrthrt	Dr_Willis	gosh. i've been only for 3 years :D
2012-06-06T10:03:00.000Z	sddhrthrt	Dr_Willis	well, i'm surprised anywa. never had troubles when i set proxy in both system settings and synaptic. now, i'll have to mess with config files again.
