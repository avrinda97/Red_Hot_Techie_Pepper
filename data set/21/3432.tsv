2009-04-16T13:54:00.000Z	sinelaw		how can i control/determine which video driver xorg is using?
2009-04-16T13:54:00.000Z	sinelaw		the xorg.conf file doesn't say much
2009-04-16T13:56:00.000Z	sinelaw		it doesn't specify antything except for saying Identifier: "default driver" or something like that
2009-04-16T13:56:00.000Z	sinelaw		but i want to know which driver is being used
2009-04-16T13:56:00.000Z	sinelaw		so how do i find out?
2009-04-16T13:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sinelaw	sudo lshw | less
2009-04-16T13:58:00.000Z	sinelaw	ActionParsnip	That gives me the hardware info - which I already know. I want to know which xorg driver is being used.
2009-04-16T13:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sinelaw	for what device?
2009-04-16T13:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sinelaw	then press q, then run: sudo lshw -C display
2009-04-16T14:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sinelaw	read the last line where it says module
2009-04-16T14:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sinelaw	thats the exact same output, just outputting the video portion
2009-04-16T14:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sinelaw	the first command I gave you shows that as well, you must've not read it
2009-04-16T14:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sinelaw	if you wanna look supe smart: sudo lshw -C display | grep driver
2009-04-16T14:03:00.000Z	sinelaw	ActionParsnip	I know what that output is and I've read it. But lshw is not what I need - it tells me what my hardware is, but I want to know what display driver xorg is using
2009-04-16T14:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sinelaw	that driver IS the one xorg is using
2009-04-16T14:03:00.000Z	sinelaw	ActionParsnip	that returns nothing.
2009-04-16T14:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sinelaw	lspci -v may help
2009-04-16T14:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sinelaw	lspci -v | grep driver
2009-04-16T14:11:00.000Z	sinelaw	ActionParsnip	that gives kernel drivers, but thanks I've already found the answer in Xorg.0.log
2010-06-01T23:36:00.000Z	sinelaw	ActionParsnip	it was _working_ in 9.10
2010-06-01T23:37:00.000Z	sinelaw	ActionParsnip	there's a whole thread and anumber of open bugs about it http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1469340&page=4
