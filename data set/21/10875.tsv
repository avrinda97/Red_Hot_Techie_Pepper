2006-03-05T15:20:00.000Z	mashuu		i'm trying to get ubuntu on a compaq v2000 cto (ati xpress 200m... i've read about problems) but it won't install.  i get the splash and boot: prompt, but if i start the default install, i get "clouds" that fade to a screen with distorted white bars.
2006-03-05T15:21:00.000Z	bobbyd	mashuu	what's the cpu/ram of that machine?
2006-03-05T15:21:00.000Z	mashuu		i've done some checking around and i can't find anything specific about installing breezy on this model.  all i see are problems with the graphics
2006-03-05T15:21:00.000Z	mashuu		i've got the turion
2006-03-05T15:21:00.000Z	mashuu		1.5gb ram
2006-03-05T15:21:00.000Z	bobbyd	mashuu	ati is crap under linux
2006-03-05T15:22:00.000Z	mashuu		yes, so i'm finding out :(
2006-03-05T15:22:00.000Z	bobbyd	mashuu	swap it for an nvidia card :/
2006-03-05T15:22:00.000Z	mashuu		i can't really swap it.  it's a laptop
2006-03-05T15:22:00.000Z	bobbyd	mashuu	you should be able to get 2d working though
2006-03-05T15:22:00.000Z	mashuu		i don't really care about 3d; i don't plan on gaming or anything of the sort
2006-03-05T15:22:00.000Z	mashuu	Mastastealth	it -works-, it just won't start the installation routine
2006-03-05T15:23:00.000Z	mashuu		i'm guessing it's something with the video adapter; i just see cloudy graphics that fade in and then the screen distorts and there's no disk activity.
2006-03-05T15:23:00.000Z	mashuu		after the boot: prompt, that is
2006-03-05T15:23:00.000Z	bobbyd	mashuu	does the live cd work?
2006-03-05T15:23:00.000Z	mashuu		hmm, i haven't tried it
2006-03-05T15:23:00.000Z	mashuu		limited bandwidth, so it's tough for me to grab it
2006-03-05T15:23:00.000Z	bobbyd	mashuu	that might give you an idea, oh
2006-03-05T15:23:00.000Z	mashuu		how big is it?
2006-03-05T15:23:00.000Z	bobbyd	mashuu	maybe try some other small livecd
2006-03-05T15:24:00.000Z	bobbyd	mashuu	puppy linux is small, 50megs, you could try that to see if any driver works at all
