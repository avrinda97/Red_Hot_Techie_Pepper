2008-07-17T13:06:00.000Z	cckk		to everyone, i installed jackd & jackEQ in order to change the assignment of my front panel mic (input) to headphone (output) but jackeq is not starting up any other suggestions on how to reassign my jacks?

2008-07-17T13:09:00.000Z	bazhang	cckk	do you have the ubuntu studio start up splash screen? that is always a good indication :)
2008-07-17T13:10:00.000Z	cckk	bazhang	no just a normal ubuntu screen like the ubuntu logo with a knight rider bar in orange under it
2008-07-17T13:10:00.000Z	bazhang	cckk	if you are using jack you may wish to get ubuntu studio with the rt kernel
2008-07-17T13:12:00.000Z	cckk	bazhang	I didnt want to use jack i was told by pvl1 that it might help me reassign those oputputs, if you know of an easier maby better way im down to learn, thank you for your help
2008-07-17T13:13:00.000Z	cckk	bazhang	btw ive only been using linux/ubuntu for about five days but i am willing to work with terminal and or gui
2008-07-17T13:14:00.000Z	cckk	bazhang	 thank you ill use synaptic?
2008-07-17T13:15:00.000Z	bazhang	cckk	if you want to install the repos and then change sure; you can ask in their channel (or here) for more info
2008-07-17T13:16:00.000Z	cckk	bazhang	clarify that a bit (dumb it down fo me)
2008-07-17T13:17:00.000Z	bazhang	cckk	you can add their software sources (aka repositories, or repos), then update your system and install the packages etc (programs for audio/video and a real time low latency kernel)
2008-07-17T13:18:00.000Z	bazhang	cckk	their channel or that link would be the definitive voice though as I have not used it in ages :)
2008-07-17T13:19:00.000Z	cckk	bazhang	ok, the first package would be ubuntustudio-desktop? they have many packages and i dont want to install in a bad order
2008-07-17T13:19:00.000Z	bazhang	cckk	that would pull in everything (be warned: big download)
2008-07-17T13:20:00.000Z	cckk	bazhang	ok how do i get to their channel? ive only been using this xchat/irc for 2 days, im am a windows junkie trying to reform
2008-07-17T13:21:00.000Z	cckk	bazhang	lol its cool no worries
2008-07-17T13:21:00.000Z	bazhang	cckk	read the link then type /join #ubuntustudio
2008-07-17T14:13:00.000Z	cckk	bazhang	sorry
