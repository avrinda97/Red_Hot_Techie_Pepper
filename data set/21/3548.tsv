2008-11-30T08:17:00.000Z	tpw_rules		i installed ubuntu, but it wont recognize the wireless module

2008-11-30T08:18:00.000Z	rmitchell	tpw_rules	run 'lspci' in a terminal and find the line about your wireless card

2008-11-30T08:27:00.000Z	rmitchell	tpw_rules	any progress?
2008-11-30T08:28:00.000Z	tpw_rules	rmitchell	im doing it right now
2008-11-30T08:28:00.000Z	rmitchell	tpw_rules	if you get stuck, i've compiled madwifi a few times, i might be able to help you out
2008-11-30T09:06:00.000Z	tpw_rules	rmitchell	i got the drivers installed, but it wont connect to my network
2008-11-30T09:06:00.000Z	tpw_rules	rmitchell	i cant seem to get the card turned on
2008-11-30T09:06:00.000Z	rmitchell	tpw_rules	when you click on your wireless icon in the tray, can you see the network(s)?
2008-11-30T09:07:00.000Z	tpw_rules	rmitchell	no
2008-11-30T09:07:00.000Z	tpw_rules	rmitchell	i tried the hidden network, but it failed
2008-11-30T09:08:00.000Z	rmitchell	tpw_rules	were you able to 'sudo modprobe ath_pci'?
2008-11-30T09:09:00.000Z	tpw_rules	rmitchell	yes
2008-11-30T09:09:00.000Z	tpw_rules	rmitchell	and it shows a grayed out 'Wireless Networks' in the tray menu that wasnt there before
2008-11-30T09:10:00.000Z	rmitchell	tpw_rules	you're sure your wifi button/switch is on?
2008-11-30T09:11:00.000Z	tpw_rules	rmitchell	thats the prob, not sure
2008-11-30T09:11:00.000Z	tpw_rules	rmitchell	its a slider so i slide to toggle, but i cant get the light that says 'on' to light up :/
2008-11-30T09:16:00.000Z	rmitchell	tpw_rules	i found another tutorial. google 'ar242x ubuntu ibex' and check out the 3rd link down
2008-11-30T09:16:00.000Z	tpw_rules	rmitchell	thanks, will try
