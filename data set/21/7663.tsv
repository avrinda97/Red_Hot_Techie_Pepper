2006-08-10T08:15:00.000Z	martalli		I just installed nvidia drivers through automatix, and I appear to have nice, accelerated graphics, but now my screen resolution is stuck at 800x600.  I ran dpkg-reconfigure xserver-corg to reset my options (I had to do that in the first place, actually).  Even after reboot, I have no other options other than 800x600.  See my xorg.conf (http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/20164), seems like I should have 1280x1024 and 1024x768, too....
2006-08-10T08:15:00.000Z	martalli		Is there another way to change the screen resolution?
2006-08-10T08:16:00.000Z	martalli		my question's not really automatix related...but looking for another way to change screen resolution...
2006-08-10T08:17:00.000Z	martalli		Ahh, then maybe only mepis
2006-08-10T08:17:00.000Z	martalli		ok bluueeagle, i'll ask there
2006-08-10T08:19:00.000Z	martalli		What in particular do you want to know about su?
2006-08-10T08:20:00.000Z	martalli		ReWt_AxS k3b (in kde distros)
2006-08-10T08:21:00.000Z	martalli		Maybe that user needs to be added to a group...
2006-08-10T08:21:00.000Z	martalli		well, a group like sudo, etc. (I wouldn't be sure which one right off the top of my head)
2006-08-10T08:21:00.000Z	EriK_	martalli	 sorry I have been out of the convo for a few minutes, but have you tried running /usr/bin/gnome-display-properties wrt changing screen rez?
2006-08-10T08:23:00.000Z	EriK_	martalli	 try it sudo/gksudo if it fails as a plebe, on my boxes it runs fine as me
2006-08-10T08:24:00.000Z	EriK_	martalli	 have a look in /etc/X11/xorg.conf and see what resolutions are listed under screen->display
2006-08-10T08:25:00.000Z	EriK_	martalli	it is easy to change that file, but you will have to be root, make you BACK IT UP first, and you will need to restart X for it to take effect (control-alt-backspace for the impatient)
2006-08-10T08:26:00.000Z	EriK_	martalli	 in case somebody else didn't ask, does control-alt+plus, control-alt-minus do anything at all?
2006-08-10T08:27:00.000Z	martalli	EriK_	 Didn't work...I've never heard of doing that before - is that a gnome trick?
2006-08-10T08:30:00.000Z	EriK_	martalli	 control-alt-plus/minus to shift resolution is part of X itself, although it can be disabled.  It's from the same people that give you control-alt-backspace when you are parranoid
2006-08-10T08:30:00.000Z	EriK_	martalli	 is the display in question an lcd panel that you wish to run at only it's native resolution?
2006-08-10T08:31:00.000Z	EriK_	martalli	 still, you might just try making a backup of that file and then removing everything except "1280x1024" (if that is what you want)
2006-08-10T08:31:00.000Z	martalli	EriK_	I think I will give that a try
2006-08-10T08:32:00.000Z	EriK_	martalli	 *then* try that control-alt-backsapce
2006-08-10T09:12:00.000Z	martalli	EriK_	I'm back, and I am still stuck in 800x600.  I noticed in my xorg.conf that Section "Device" shows " BusID                "PCI:3:0:0"" - is this correct, since my card is AGP?
