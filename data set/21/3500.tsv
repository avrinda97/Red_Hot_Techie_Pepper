2008-12-10T20:17:00.000Z	LjL	esenoy	does modprobe -r remove it?
2008-12-10T20:18:00.000Z	esenoy	LjL	no, it didn't wors
2008-12-10T20:19:00.000Z	esenoy	LjL	how can I force a module to unload?
2008-12-10T20:20:00.000Z	LjL	esenoy	i don't know, modprobe -r usually manages to remove them for me.  does lsmod not give any clue why it's in use?
2008-12-10T20:21:00.000Z	esenoy	LjL	I've even blacklisted it with no results
2008-12-10T20:21:00.000Z	esenoy	LjL	I simply can't stop using it...
2008-12-10T20:21:00.000Z	LjL	esenoy	which modules is it anyway
2008-12-10T20:22:00.000Z	esenoy	LjL	rt61 module
2008-12-10T20:23:00.000Z	esenoy	LjL	I compiled it from source, but works very bad
2008-12-10T20:23:00.000Z	LjL	esenoy	so not rt61pci?
2008-12-10T20:23:00.000Z	esenoy	LjL	now I can't unload it
2008-12-10T20:23:00.000Z	esenoy	LjL	and blacklist it don't seems to work
2008-12-10T20:29:00.000Z	esenoy	LjL	Can I remove the module manually? Where is the module located?
2008-12-10T20:32:00.000Z	LjL	esenoy	somewhere in /lib/modules, use "find /lib/modules | grep rt61"
2008-12-10T20:32:00.000Z	esenoy	LjL	Ok... I located the module (rt61.ko), but before deleting it I need to know if there is some file that calls for it
2008-12-10T20:32:00.000Z	esenoy	LjL	Is anywhere a file that calls for modules?
2008-12-10T20:32:00.000Z	LjL	esenoy	you said you compiled it yourself, no?
2008-12-10T20:33:00.000Z	esenoy	LjL	yes
2008-12-10T20:33:00.000Z	LjL	esenoy	then you can remove it safely
2008-12-10T20:34:00.000Z	esenoy	LjL	nice... I only have to delete file, isn't it?
2008-12-10T20:41:00.000Z	esenoy	LjL	I'm gonna try to delete module... THX (I think that my wifi will fall)
