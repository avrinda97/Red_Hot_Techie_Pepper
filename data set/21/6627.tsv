2007-03-25T11:18:00.000Z	davidjohnston		does anyone in here give suggestions on home setups
2007-03-25T11:18:00.000Z	crdlb	davidjohnston	specifically?
2007-03-25T11:19:00.000Z	davidjohnston	crdlb	 ok basically I use a OS X 10.4 laptop
2007-03-25T11:21:00.000Z	crdlb	davidjohnston	ubotu is a bot :D
2007-03-25T11:21:00.000Z	davidjohnston	crdlb	thanks
2007-03-25T11:21:00.000Z	crdlb	davidjohnston	so you're asking if kubuntu is a good idea?
2007-03-25T11:23:00.000Z	davidjohnston	crdlb	so one will be Kubuntu, then one will be a test server using Ubuntu server to run a lamp and also support RoR, this will also be a svn server.  Finally the third will be another Ubuntu server used as a file share to the win and mac laptops using samba and it will have a HFS+ external drive on it, but I've already loaded the HFS+ drivers for linux and they work wonderfully
2007-03-25T11:23:00.000Z	davidjohnston	crdlb	 does that sound decent
2007-03-25T11:24:00.000Z	crdlb	davidjohnston	I don't see a problem
2007-03-25T11:24:00.000Z	davidjohnston	crdlb	sorry just never used Ubuntu...i've always used SuSe and just thought I would get an opinion
2007-03-25T11:25:00.000Z	crdlb	davidjohnston	I don't see why not combine the two servers though?
2007-03-25T11:25:00.000Z	davidjohnston	crdlb	and then what would I use the 3rd box for...plus remember these machines are not extremely fast and don't have tons of ram either
2007-03-25T11:25:00.000Z	davidjohnston	crdlb	or big hd's really either except one
2007-03-25T11:27:00.000Z	crdlb	davidjohnston	I really think one computer can handle all your server needs easily, but what you do with the spare is up to you :D
2007-03-25T11:28:00.000Z	davidjohnston	crdlb	 since it's svn and I may have multiple projects i was just concerned for space, then also the machine that has the space i planned on using for Kubuntu because the gui and all
2007-03-25T11:30:00.000Z	davidjohnston	crdlb	so what would use the third for because i already have one coming for archiving
2007-03-25T11:31:00.000Z	crdlb	davidjohnston	you could use it for backing up the other two
2007-03-25T11:32:00.000Z	davidjohnston	crdlb	well thanks for the opinion...one more thing, you ever setup Rails on Apache
2007-03-25T11:32:00.000Z	crdlb	davidjohnston	nope, I've only needed php
2007-03-25T11:33:00.000Z	davidjohnston	crdlb	yea me too so far...i've just read horror stories, but i'll get it up
2007-03-25T11:33:00.000Z	davidjohnston	crdlb	thanks for your opinion...night to all
