2008-04-14T08:08:00.000Z	efirewick	usser	is it pretty stable?
2008-04-14T07:56:00.000Z	usser	efirewick	what do you mean?
2008-04-14T07:56:00.000Z	usser	efirewick	if u have somebody who knows a bit of sql u can use mysql or postgresql
2008-04-14T07:57:00.000Z	efirewick	usser	thanks I'll look into it.
2008-04-14T07:58:00.000Z	usser	efirewick	or u can use openoffice base tool similar to access
2008-04-14T07:59:00.000Z	efirewick	usser	I didn't know if anyone has made specific software or not. I've never used sql
2008-04-14T08:00:00.000Z	usser	efirewick	try openoffice base first its easy and to a large extend self explanatory much like MS access
2008-04-14T08:02:00.000Z	efirewick	usser	It just seems that you search on it and windows has hundreds of programs. but I have not found 1 for ubuntu...
2008-04-14T08:03:00.000Z	efirewick	usser	I just can't stand to use windows for anything important...
2008-04-14T08:04:00.000Z	usser	efirewick	mysql would be your best bet but you'll have to spend some time configuring and learning it
2008-04-14T08:07:00.000Z	usser	efirewick	i usually use phpmyadmin to do configuration tasks and something like mysql-navigator for client
2008-04-14T08:09:00.000Z	usser	efirewick	what mysql? well yea lots of companies use it
2008-04-14T08:09:00.000Z	efirewick	usser	good, thanks.
2008-04-14T08:10:00.000Z	usser	efirewick	np
2008-04-14T08:30:00.000Z	efirewick	usser	have you heard of the LAMP install for 7.10
2008-04-14T08:35:00.000Z	usser	efirewick	yea sure thats how its usually done
2008-04-14T08:36:00.000Z	efirewick	usser	good, thank you.
2008-04-14T08:37:00.000Z	usser	efirewick	no problem so u decided to go with it?
2008-04-14T08:40:00.000Z	efirewick	usser	yeah, I am going to give it a try. I hope it is easy to add/edit, because my wife is the one entering and locating customers...
2008-04-14T08:42:00.000Z	efirewick	usser	I am just worried about the interface. I haven't seen any screen shots or anything about it yet, just info about the install so far.
2008-04-14T08:54:00.000Z	efirewick	usser	is there anywhere I can read about how to configure/use this LAMP stuff? I am reading about how to install it on the internet, But I would like to learn more about it before I install it, and I can't find any other info about it...
