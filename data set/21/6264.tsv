2007-06-13T13:21:00.000Z	livingdaylight		ai karamba... no one can help me identify what codec i requires to make my divx / avi films play in Feisty?
2007-06-13T13:21:00.000Z	livingdaylight		.... and so many gurus here....*sigh*
2007-06-13T13:22:00.000Z	agn0stic	livingdaylight	spelled your name wrong, whoops
2007-06-13T13:23:00.000Z	agn0stic	livingdaylight	you might try installing vlc and seeing if it will play it, if you haven't already
2007-06-13T13:23:00.000Z	livingdaylight	agn0stic	i'm curious now to identify the particular avi that is missing though... I
2007-06-13T13:24:00.000Z	agn0stic	livingdaylight	could you pastebin the output of mplayer -identify on one of the files that doesn't work?
2007-06-13T13:25:00.000Z	livingdaylight	agn0stic	i just click on the file and i think Totem opens . What output where?
2007-06-13T13:26:00.000Z	agn0stic	livingdaylight	from a terminal. you might have to install mplayer as well. Alternatively, you could just install every codec you can find
2007-06-13T13:27:00.000Z	agn0stic	livingdaylight	theres a bunch of different codecs for avis
2007-06-13T13:27:00.000Z	livingdaylight	agn0stic	i see them now and i gonna install ALL of them...
2007-06-13T13:28:00.000Z	agn0stic	livingdaylight	well it can tell you the info you need to find out what codec you need
2007-06-13T13:29:00.000Z	livingdaylight	agn0stic	should i instll mplayer then so i can identify outpput?
2007-06-13T13:29:00.000Z	agn0stic	livingdaylight	it's an option. or just install all the codecs.
2007-06-13T13:30:00.000Z	livingdaylight	agn0stic	ok, i install all the codecs first
2007-06-13T13:39:00.000Z	agn0stic	livingdaylight	got no clue. try this: http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Feisty#How_to_install_Multimedia_Codecs
2007-06-13T13:41:00.000Z	agn0stic	livingdaylight	that's because vlc  uses it's own codecs . .. kinda.
2007-06-13T13:46:00.000Z	agn0stic	livingdaylight	http://www.ubuntugeek.com/install-mplayer-and-multimedia-codecs-libdvdcss2w32codecs-in-ubuntu-feisty-fawn.html first on google for w32codecs ubuntu feisty
2007-06-13T13:57:00.000Z	livingdaylight	agn0stic	check it out... Totem playes it now... despite installing all the codecs it wasn't working... this intrigued me... i installed totem-xine which replaced gstreameer and now it works too. So now Totem works and VLC
2007-06-13T13:57:00.000Z	agn0stic	livingdaylight	yes, that's because you're using a different engine, that uses different codecs
2007-06-13T13:59:00.000Z	livingdaylight	agn0stic	so it wasn't the codecs that were the issue perhaps but the engine i needed to switch ovwer to
2007-06-13T14:00:00.000Z	agn0stic	livingdaylight	it's a bit complicated. google and read if you want to understand the whole engine/codec/playing videos thing
