2007-08-26T10:43:00.000Z	arun		I just installed an application from a script (not the repos). what would be the best way to uninstall it?
2007-08-26T10:43:00.000Z	pike_	arun	alot of scripts have an --uninstall switch
2007-08-26T10:44:00.000Z	arun	pike_	so.. for example?
2007-08-26T10:44:00.000Z	pike_	arun	well for example 'sudo scriptname.sh --uninstall'
2007-08-26T10:45:00.000Z	arun	pike_	alright, will try it. thanks
2007-08-26T10:46:00.000Z	arun	pike_	it's a bash script, is that ok?
2007-08-26T10:47:00.000Z	pike_	arun	yeah. you have a link to the script? maybe someone can look at it
2007-08-26T10:47:00.000Z	arun	pike_	the bash script installed mozilla sunbird to the /usr/bin directory
2007-08-26T10:48:00.000Z	pike_	arun	well.. unless youre concerned about the libs you could just remove the executables for it
2007-08-26T10:48:00.000Z	arun	pike_	here's the script -- http://pastebin.ubuntu-nl.org/35136/
2007-08-26T10:49:00.000Z	arun	pike_	any ideas? :)
2007-08-26T10:50:00.000Z	pike_	arun	rm -fr /etc/opt/sunbird; rm /usr/share/applications/sunbird.desktop; rm /usr/bin/sunbird   should do it
2007-08-26T10:50:00.000Z	arun	pike_	great, thanks. that won't affect the other apps, right?
2007-08-26T10:51:00.000Z	pike_	arun	nope
2007-08-26T10:51:00.000Z	arun	pike_	thanks a lot! what's rm -fr for
2007-08-26T10:51:00.000Z	arun		ah alright
2007-08-26T10:51:00.000Z	pike_	arun	the -f just means dont prompt me with a y or n. it means force and the -r means recursive so you use that when you want to delete a directory containing files
2007-08-26T10:52:00.000Z	arun	pike_	alright.. thank you so much!!
2007-08-26T10:52:00.000Z	pike_		np
2007-08-26T10:52:00.000Z	pike_	arun	bear in mind youll need to prefface all that with sudo
2007-08-26T10:53:00.000Z	arun	pike_	yup, i guessed as much. thanks a lot, it seems to have worked
