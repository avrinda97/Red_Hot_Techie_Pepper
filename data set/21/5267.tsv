2008-03-22T22:59:00.000Z	RobD		any body got any ideas re installing an older kernel?
2008-03-22T22:59:00.000Z	Stroganoff	RobD	why do you wanna do that?
2008-03-22T23:00:00.000Z	RobD	Stroganoff	- cos the kernel in Gutsy isn't supported by my CPU and panics on boot / init
2008-03-22T23:00:00.000Z	Stroganoff	RobD	have you filed a bug report yet?
2008-03-22T23:02:00.000Z	RobD	Stroganoff	- not yet no - didn't think it was a bug TBH, unless Ubuntu is expected to support every hardware config under the sun :-)
2008-03-22T23:02:00.000Z	Stroganoff	RobD	actually it is ^^
2008-03-22T23:03:00.000Z	Stroganoff	RobD	http://packages.ubuntu.com/gutsy/linux-image-2.6.22-14-generic
2008-03-22T23:03:00.000Z	RobD	Stroganoff	- well smack my ass and call me susie. Have installed that and it still doesn't work
2008-03-22T23:04:00.000Z	Stroganoff	RobD	or compile your own kernel. its not THAT hard
2008-03-22T23:04:00.000Z	RobD	Stroganoff	- :-) so says you. Off hand do you know which Kernel Fiesty used as I can get that to install without issue
2008-03-22T23:05:00.000Z	Stroganoff	RobD	feisty used linux-image-2.6.20-16-generic
2008-03-22T23:05:00.000Z	Stroganoff	RobD	but you can't install it unless you modify your sources.list
2008-03-22T23:06:00.000Z	Stroganoff	RobD	it might
2008-03-22T23:06:00.000Z	Stroganoff	RobD	thats for you to find out :D
2008-03-22T23:20:00.000Z	RobD	Stroganoff	- well that kind of worked but I have a few modules / init scripts that fail to run - still looks pretty good to me!
2008-03-22T23:20:00.000Z	Stroganoff	RobD	well
2008-03-22T23:21:00.000Z	Stroganoff	RobD	good luck in fixing these :D
2008-03-22T23:22:00.000Z	RobD	Stroganoff	- I may just live with them TBH - it;s only App Armor and Kernel.maps_protect
2008-03-22T23:23:00.000Z	Stroganoff	RobD	you can disabe app armor with "sudo update-rc.d -f apparmor remove"
2008-03-22T23:23:00.000Z	RobD	Stroganoff	- done
2008-03-22T23:26:00.000Z	RobD	Stroganoff	- no worries - at least I now have a live server - I can work on the details as I go along - Thanks for all your help
