2006-07-25T13:18:00.000Z	xed		would it be possible for me to install it Ubuntu onto an external harddrive being connected via USB ?
2006-07-25T13:18:00.000Z	xed		ONTO the harddrive, not FROM it..
2006-07-25T13:18:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	xed	that would be .... slow, but I think its possible.
2006-07-25T13:31:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	xed	a 4 MB video card?! My phone has more memory for its video
2006-07-25T13:31:00.000Z	xed	fyrestrtr	It's an old video card, I fu.. messed up the AGP port on that old motherboard, and I am not going to spend money on an AMD 550MHz computer
2006-07-25T13:32:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	xed	you could use it as a gateway/router/server type machine.
2006-07-25T13:32:00.000Z	xed	fyrestrtr	That's pretty much what I plan to do with it..
2006-07-25T13:32:00.000Z	xed	fyrestrtr	And maybe install some office-like application (maybe open office?) and use it for that..
2006-07-25T13:33:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	xed	no, that would not work too good.
2006-07-25T14:12:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	xed	lspci | grep VGA
2006-07-25T14:13:00.000Z	xed	fyrestrtr	iiiears: where do I go about typing all this in...?
2006-07-25T14:13:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	xed	in a terminal window
2006-07-25T14:14:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	xed	bad mirror
2006-07-25T14:15:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	xed	by the way, why are you downloading the xubuntu iso?
2006-07-25T14:15:00.000Z	xed	fyrestrtr	link me to a faster one?
2006-07-25T14:15:00.000Z	xed	fyrestrtr	because.. someone suggested it be better for a slower machine...?
2006-07-25T14:16:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	xed	you don't have an operating system installed on there yet?
2006-07-25T14:16:00.000Z	xed	fyrestrtr	Apparently NOT but I am SURE that 5.04 finished.. but 5.04 wouldn't.. boot "x", whatever that is..
2006-07-25T14:17:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	xed	sorry to tell you this, but you could have saved yourself a lot of hassle, by downloading the alternate install cd, type 'server' at the boot prompt and then typing sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop :)
2006-07-25T10:48:00.000Z	xed	fyrestrtr	what would you say is lighter than Opera?
2006-07-25T10:54:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	xed	don't recommend it. Forcing refresh rates can damage your video equipment.
