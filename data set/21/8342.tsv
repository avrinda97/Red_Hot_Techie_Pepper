2008-08-08T08:42:00.000Z	jay_		i apologize if my questions sound stupid, but for a person that just installed linux for the first time 1 hour ago it is diffrent
2008-08-08T08:42:00.000Z	jay_		the only command i know is sudo apt-get and ls and cd ..
2008-08-08T08:43:00.000Z	jay_		thank you
2008-08-08T08:44:00.000Z	jay_		is it easy to convert a ubuntu client o a ubuntu web and ftp server?
2008-08-08T08:45:00.000Z	jay_		thanks
2008-08-08T08:45:00.000Z	jay_		what is the ./ command about?
2008-08-08T08:46:00.000Z	jay_		to execute something?
2008-08-08T08:47:00.000Z	jay_		I tried to make a directory in filesystem called downloads and it said i did not have permission, what is that about?
2008-08-08T08:47:00.000Z	jay_		so mkdir downloads?
2008-08-08T08:48:00.000Z	jay_		i am the admin
2008-08-08T08:48:00.000Z	Marco	jay_	no, mkdir creates a directory
2008-08-08T08:49:00.000Z	Marco	jay_	the linux security model has users with limited privileges so that any damage that occurs is minimized.  If you want to do something that requires admin privileges, you have to prefix the c ommand with "sudo"
2008-08-08T08:49:00.000Z	Marco	jay_	you shouldn't put directories in /
2008-08-08T08:50:00.000Z	Marco	jay_	yes
2008-08-08T08:50:00.000Z	Marco	jay_	the best way to learn is what you're doing, diving in
2008-08-08T08:52:00.000Z	Marco	jay_	ehhh, kind of.  In linux, a file is executable or not depending on its permissions
2008-08-08T08:53:00.000Z	Marco	jay_	most installed programs will be in /usr/bin
2008-08-08T08:56:00.000Z	Marco	jay_	in xchat: Settings -> Preferences -> Network Setup
2008-08-08T09:01:00.000Z	Marco	jay_	what do you mean?
2008-08-08T09:13:00.000Z	Marco	jay_	well, whatever works for you
2008-08-08T09:19:00.000Z	Marco	jay_	the only time you really want to be installing from source is if you're developing for that app or if you need/want a new feature in the later versions
