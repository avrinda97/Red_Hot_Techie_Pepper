2006-08-15T10:46:00.000Z	morphix	cdew4545	Dlink DWL-520?
2006-08-15T10:47:00.000Z	morphix	cdew4545	rev E1?
2006-08-15T10:47:00.000Z	cdew4545	morphix	 yep
2006-08-15T10:47:00.000Z	morphix	cdew4545	ok, go to, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Device/DWL-520vE1?highlight=%28WifiDocs%2FDevice%29
2006-08-15T10:49:00.000Z	cdew4545	morphix	 what if a wlan0 already shows up when i install?
2006-08-15T10:49:00.000Z	cdew4545	morphix	 does that mean it already recognizes the card?
2006-08-15T10:50:00.000Z	morphix	cdew4545	it might, but doesnt mean it will properly, i had that with a buffalo wireless card.
2006-08-15T10:51:00.000Z	cdew4545	morphix	 I will run through that again, but im pretty sure I already tried that.  Does it matter if the network is encrypted or not?  In ubuntu it always seems to want a key, but i live out in the country and only am keeping my wireless router here for another week so i didnt bother with encryption
2006-08-15T10:52:00.000Z	morphix	cdew4545	shouldnt matter at all as long as u configure everything properly
2006-08-15T11:33:00.000Z	cdew4545	morphix	 hey, im back with another question on my Dwl-520 wireless problem
2006-08-15T11:34:00.000Z	cdew4545	morphix	 at the beginning of the help document you gave me.... its said CONFIG_NET_RADIO option must be enabled
2006-08-15T11:35:00.000Z	morphix	cdew4545	i dont know, i never used that card, i am just passing a help guide on
2006-08-15T11:37:00.000Z	cdew4545	morphix	 ok, but do you know about enabling that option?
2006-08-15T11:38:00.000Z	cdew4545	morphix	 sorry to single you out for the questions, but you just seemed like a good source
2006-08-15T11:38:00.000Z	morphix	cdew4545	unfortunately not. i'll take a look tho
2006-08-15T11:39:00.000Z	morphix	cdew4545	what part of the guide does it give u an error?
2006-08-15T11:42:00.000Z	cdew4545	morphix	 right at the dpkg -i hostap-modules-XXXXX.deb instruction
2006-08-15T11:44:00.000Z	cdew4545	morphix	 i found some help to enable that so Im going to go try that, but thanks for putting up with me haha
