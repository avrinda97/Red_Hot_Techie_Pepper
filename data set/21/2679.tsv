2009-07-29T07:10:00.000Z	chauncellor		either
2009-07-29T07:11:00.000Z	chauncellor		*is not a fan of pirated music*
2009-07-29T07:11:00.000Z	funkywds	chauncellor	pirated music is music
2009-07-29T07:12:00.000Z	chauncellor	funkywds	ROMs are games. So what's your point? :)
2009-07-29T07:12:00.000Z	funkywds	chauncellor	point?  who said i had a point?
2009-07-29T07:13:00.000Z	chauncellor	funkywds	forgive me, I thought you were trying to make one. I guess you were just writing nonsense into the textbar
2009-07-29T07:13:00.000Z	funkywds	chauncellor	what, like pirated music sounds different?  it's not like the difference between butter and margarine
2009-07-29T07:13:00.000Z	funkywds	chauncellor	and there's no need to be rude
2009-07-29T07:14:00.000Z	chauncellor	funkywds	you're comparing mp3s and cds. You can get both legally and illegally, just like your types of cooking materials
2009-07-29T07:14:00.000Z	funkywds	chauncellor	and if you want meandering nonsense, i suggest you listen to sarah palin's quitter speach/rant
2009-07-29T07:14:00.000Z	funkywds	chauncellor	i'm not comparing media, i'm comparing pirated vs non-pirated
2009-07-29T07:15:00.000Z	chauncellor	funkywds	non-sequitur, I'm not interested in politics,
2009-07-29T07:15:00.000Z	funkywds	chauncellor	your interest is not what defines a non-sequiter
2009-07-29T07:15:00.000Z	chauncellor	funkywds	you're comparing brands of items. It doesn't come close to comparing legality.
2009-07-29T07:16:00.000Z	funkywds	chauncellor	it's called a metaphore
2009-07-29T07:16:00.000Z	chauncellor	funkywds	No, I believe it's called a metaphor, I don't quite know what a metaphore is
2009-07-29T07:17:00.000Z	funkywds	chauncellor	the legalilty of music does not effect it's sound, quality, or any other aspect but the legality of it
2009-07-29T07:17:00.000Z	funkywds	chauncellor	that was my point, which you missed fantastically
2009-07-29T07:17:00.000Z	chauncellor	funkywds	precisely why your butter/margarine made no since. The legality of it does not affect the ingredients or composition
2009-07-29T07:18:00.000Z	chauncellor	funkywds	I'm sorry
2009-07-29T07:18:00.000Z	chauncellor	funkywds	let's just drop it.
