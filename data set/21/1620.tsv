2010-07-05T22:05:00.000Z	slidinghorn	acovrig	someone told you to check the imapd log...what did it say?
2010-07-05T22:06:00.000Z	acovrig	slidinghorn	doesn't exist, `ls /var/log|grep imap` returns nothing, how do I install it
2010-07-05T22:07:00.000Z	slidinghorn	acovrig	there's a link to a mailserver setup here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Squirrelmail
2010-07-05T22:27:00.000Z	acovrig	slidinghorn	that is ok, so I went to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MailServer then https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Postfix and uninstall SMTP, now I am confuzed and it says that it needs SMTP
2010-07-05T22:29:00.000Z	acovrig	slidinghorn	do I need SMTP?
2010-07-05T22:31:00.000Z	slidinghorn	acovrig	yes...you need smtp *and* IMAP...smtp is "send mail transfer protocol" which allows you to use the server to -- well, send mail.  IMAP allows you to download the email from other locations...
2010-07-05T22:31:00.000Z	acovrig	slidinghorn	when I installed imap, it remove smtp
2010-07-05T22:32:00.000Z	slidinghorn	acovrig	what delivery agent did you use?
2010-07-05T22:32:00.000Z	acovrig	slidinghorn	delivery agent?
2010-07-05T22:33:00.000Z	slidinghorn	acovrig	it's explained in the mailserver howto you were following
2010-07-05T22:33:00.000Z	acovrig	slidinghorn	`apt-get install postfix`
2010-07-05T22:34:00.000Z	slidinghorn	acovrig	for future reference, it's recommended that you read all the way through a tutorial before performing any of the tasks within it...
2010-07-05T22:34:00.000Z	slidinghorn	acovrig	you should read further down in that howto...it tells you about dovecot, etc...
2010-07-05T22:36:00.000Z	acovrig	slidinghorn	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MailServer just confuzes me
2010-07-05T22:38:00.000Z	acovrig	slidinghorn	what do I need for IMAP?
2010-07-05T22:39:00.000Z	slidinghorn	acovrig	i'm probably not the best person to ask about this...I'm sorry...wish I could be of more help
2010-07-05T22:43:00.000Z	slidinghorn	acovrig	no...it's russian, i just told him this is his last warning because he's been told to either speak english or go to the russian channel
2010-07-05T22:44:00.000Z	acovrig	slidinghorn	it looks kinda funny to me, cuz all I see are \ and random numbers lol
2010-07-05T22:44:00.000Z	slidinghorn	acovrig	oh, you must not have all the language packs installed
2010-07-05T22:45:00.000Z	acovrig	slidinghorn	nope lol
