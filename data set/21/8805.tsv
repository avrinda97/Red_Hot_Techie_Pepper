2006-01-09T17:09:00.000Z	JoeBlow		ok, i got it properly changed now
2006-01-09T17:10:00.000Z	JoeBlow		it still wont let me install it, it says depends wine
2006-01-09T17:11:00.000Z	JoeBlow		i cant even get wine installed, it wont let me download the packages
2006-01-09T17:12:00.000Z	JoeBlow		why does it tell me wine is not installable??
2006-01-09T17:14:00.000Z	JoeBlow		where can i find the terminal in ubuntu?
2006-01-09T17:14:00.000Z	apokryphos	JoeBlow	alt+f2 -> gnome-terminal
2006-01-10T17:55:00.000Z	apokryphos	JoeBlow	gparted
2006-01-10T17:59:00.000Z	apokryphos	JoeBlow	vfat
2006-01-10T06:01:00.000Z	JoeBlow	apokryphos	it says mkfs.vfat 2.11 (12 Mar 2005)
2006-01-10T06:01:00.000Z	apokryphos	JoeBlow	what's the exact command you're entering?
2006-01-10T06:02:00.000Z	JoeBlow	apokryphos	mkfs -t vfat /dev/sda1
2006-01-10T06:03:00.000Z	apokryphos	JoeBlow	with sudo, right? And you get no errors?
2006-01-10T06:04:00.000Z	JoeBlow	apokryphos	right with sudo, and it says only mkfs.vfat 2.11 (12 Mar 2005)
2006-01-10T06:05:00.000Z	apokryphos	JoeBlow	very weird; perhaps consider using gparted.
2006-01-10T06:06:00.000Z	JoeBlow	apokryphos	ok , can i find that in synaptic
2006-01-10T06:06:00.000Z	apokryphos	JoeBlow	yes; it might be installed on ubuntu by default, I think.
2006-01-10T06:07:00.000Z	JoeBlow	apokryphos	now it wont even let me mount the drive
2006-01-10T06:08:00.000Z	apokryphos	JoeBlow	what are you using to mount it? Does sudo fdisk -l  definitely suggest it's still ntfs?
2006-01-10T06:08:00.000Z	JoeBlow	apokryphos	the admin tools disk
2006-01-10T06:58:00.000Z	apokryphos	JoeBlow	do not paste in here.
2006-01-10T06:59:00.000Z	JoeBlow	apokryphos	oh ok, sorry
