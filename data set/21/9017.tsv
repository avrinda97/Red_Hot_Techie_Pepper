2005-12-03T10:10:00.000Z	n0dl	pppoe_dude	cool thanx. have you ever heard of polyphasic sleep?
2005-12-03T10:10:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	n0dl	whats that?
2005-12-03T10:11:00.000Z	n0dl	pppoe_dude	its when you sleep 15-30 every four hours instead of sleeping 8 hrs strait
2005-12-03T10:12:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	n0dl	interesting... i bet it results in more dreaming.... but prolly needs a lot of determination
2005-12-03T10:12:00.000Z	n0dl	pppoe_dude	lol well imma try it out now
2005-12-03T10:16:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	n0dl	polyphasic sleep will prolly do some damage, as your brain wouldn't get a chance to enter crucial stages of sleep
2005-12-03T10:16:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	n0dl	your immune system gets a boost during deep sleep, which unfortunately you wont reach that way ;)
