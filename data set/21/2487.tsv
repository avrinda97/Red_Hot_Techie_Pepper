2011-02-06T03:57:00.000Z	brandon420	smw	to make rtorrent watch a directory, i would change chedule = watch_directory,5,5,load_start=./watch/*.torrent to      chedule = watch_directory,5,5,load_start= ~/Downloads/*.torrent          right?
2011-02-06T03:58:00.000Z	smw	brandon420	not sure ~ will work
2011-02-06T03:58:00.000Z	brandon420	smw	just use /Downloads/
2011-02-06T03:58:00.000Z	smw	brandon420	I would put the full path if that does not work
2011-02-06T03:58:00.000Z	smw	brandon420	no
2011-02-06T03:58:00.000Z	brandon420	smw	gotcha   =)
2011-02-06T03:58:00.000Z	smw	brandon420	/home/youruser/Downloads
2011-02-06T03:59:00.000Z	smw	brandon420	~ may work, but I do not think so.
2011-02-06T04:01:00.000Z	brandon420	smw	(18:01:33) Could not read resource file: ~/.rtorrent.rc
2011-02-06T04:02:00.000Z	smw	brandon420	maybe there is an error in it?
2011-02-06T04:02:00.000Z	smw	brandon420	I don't know, I have never gotten that.
2011-02-06T04:02:00.000Z	brandon420	smw	can i have a copy of your config? lolol
2011-02-06T04:03:00.000Z	smw	brandon420	no, I don't have a watch dir setup anymore
2011-02-06T04:03:00.000Z	smw	brandon420	I have since moved on to usenet :-P
2011-02-06T04:04:00.000Z	smw	brandon420	you can get the example one from /usr/share/doc/rtorrent
