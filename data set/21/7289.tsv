2006-10-28T11:03:00.000Z	dhn_		upgrading Linux is a pain
2006-10-28T11:03:00.000Z	dhn_		it took me a day to download the necessary files, and it messed up X
2006-10-28T11:04:00.000Z	dhn_		reconunit415: try WINE
2006-10-28T11:06:00.000Z	dhn_		Does anyone know what command to use to fix the settings for X?
2006-10-28T11:06:00.000Z	wastrel	dhn_	 sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2006-10-28T11:08:00.000Z	wastrel	dhn_	 google around for your monitor's settings and add them manually to /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-10-28T11:09:00.000Z	wastrel	dhn_	 i don't suppose you saved a copy of your xorg.conf from dapper :] 
2006-10-28T11:09:00.000Z	dhn_	wastrel	it saves it automatically when you run the upgrade
2006-10-28T11:10:00.000Z	wastrel	dhn_	 your monitor settings should be in the old one then.
2006-10-28T11:10:00.000Z	dhn_	wastrel	yeah, but that one borked when I tried to load X
2006-10-28T11:10:00.000Z	wastrel	dhn_	 did you replace the whole file or just the monitor section?
2006-10-28T11:11:00.000Z	dhn_	wastrel	whole file
2006-10-28T11:11:00.000Z	dhn_	wastrel	I'm not sure which one is the monitor section, is it the screen?
2006-10-28T11:11:00.000Z	dhn_	wastrel	it's pretty hard to do text editing with vi
2006-10-28T11:11:00.000Z	dhn_	wastrel	I only know so many commands
2006-10-28T11:11:00.000Z	wastrel	dhn_	 use nano  ?
2006-10-28T11:27:00.000Z	wastrel	dhn_	 in this context it doesn't matter
2006-10-28T11:27:00.000Z	dhn_	wastrel	just making sure nobody sends their passwords over telnet
2006-10-28T11:27:00.000Z	wastrel	dhn_	 do you POP your mail?  :] 
2006-10-28T11:27:00.000Z	dhn_	wastrel	touche
2006-10-28T12:48:00.000Z	dhn_	wastrel	how ironic, the driver from the vendor didn't work while the open-source one did
