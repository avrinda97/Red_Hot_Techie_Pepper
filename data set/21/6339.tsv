2011-03-14T22:46:00.000Z	judgen		When you install grub(2) in the mbr. Will the entire MBR be cleared during the process or are there bytes that is not touched? i am trying to rid my windows disk from a rootkit that is in the last bytes of the MBR using my ubuntu partition.
2011-03-14T22:48:00.000Z	llutz	judgen	nope, maximum 440 bytes (of 512)
2011-03-14T22:48:00.000Z	judgen	llutz	how do i clear the last bytes then?
2011-03-14T22:48:00.000Z	llutz	judgen	you shouldn't, it contains the partition table
2011-03-14T22:49:00.000Z	judgen	llutz	even so, i can reinstall everything just as long as i am sure that there is nothing left of that vicious rootkit left on the disk. I have nothing of importance on the drives anyways.
2011-03-14T22:50:00.000Z	judgen	llutz	the partition table is altered by me recently. So those bytes should be overwritten then?
2011-03-14T22:50:00.000Z	llutz	judgen	but then you have a "virgin" disk. no bootloader, no partitions
2011-03-14T22:51:00.000Z	judgen	llutz	would the process take a very long time?
2011-03-14T22:51:00.000Z	llutz	judgen	0.01 sec
2011-03-14T22:52:00.000Z	judgen	llutz	is dd installed by default on the net-boot disk? as i guess i can not run it from active partition.. right?
2011-03-14T22:52:00.000Z	llutz	judgen	what are we speaking about "MBR using my ubuntu partition."      MBR or ubuntu partition? those are different things
2011-03-14T22:54:00.000Z	judgen	llutz	i want the disks to be virgin clean, so that no bits are left at all. The rootkit i have contracted on my windows disk puts some code in the MBR and then the rest of the code in free space on the drive and is highly encrypted.
2011-03-14T22:55:00.000Z	judgen	llutz	i will use that. Hopefully it will be spankingly good for it =D
2011-03-14T22:55:00.000Z	llutz	judgen	i don't know if the netinstall-cd comes with dd, i'd guess yes
2011-03-15T00:19:00.000Z	judgen	llutz	Nope a dd did not fix the issue...
2011-03-15T00:19:00.000Z	judgen	llutz	Maybe the disks are all about to die or something. But it seems odd, as they are new and from different manufacturers.
2011-03-15T00:25:00.000Z	llutz	judgen	checked cables?
2011-03-15T00:25:00.000Z	judgen	llutz	yup several different ones.
2011-03-15T00:26:00.000Z	judgen	llutz	but i have one more that is still in it's plastic so i will try that cable too.
2011-05-04T18:43:00.000Z	llutz	judgen	xset -dpms
2011-05-04T18:44:00.000Z	judgen	llutz	still get screen blanking every five minutes without activity...
