2005-05-08T07:41:00.000Z	occy	elcu	:/
2005-05-08T07:42:00.000Z	elcu	occy	sorry, i'm not sure, it might be the drive itself.  you could try and convert the DVD to a format that you can read of the HDD
2005-05-08T07:42:00.000Z	occy	elcu	how could I do that?
2005-05-08T07:42:00.000Z	occy	elcu	convert the DVD to a format... to read from the hard drive?
2005-05-08T07:42:00.000Z	elcu	occy	convert it to divx or some such.  haven't done it myself.
2005-05-08T07:45:00.000Z	occy	elcu	With Warty, I just folled ubuntu guide and DVD was working.
2005-05-08T07:45:00.000Z	occy	elcu	Hoary is the suck for DVD
2005-05-08T07:46:00.000Z	elcu	occy	still using warty myself.
2005-05-08T08:05:00.000Z	occy	elcu	hdparm -d1 /dev/hdd
2005-05-08T08:06:00.000Z	occy	elcu	that seems to have fixed the speed issue of the DVD
2005-05-08T08:06:00.000Z	elcu	occy	nice one.
