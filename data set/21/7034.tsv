2007-12-25T00:39:00.000Z	wols	magic_ninja	that is not exactly possible. how do you come to this conclusion?
2007-12-25T00:40:00.000Z	wols	magic_ninja	that doesn't explain why you think it's running
2007-12-25T00:40:00.000Z	wols	magic_ninja	netstat -anp |grep 21
2007-12-25T00:40:00.000Z	wols	magic_ninja	sudo netstat -anp |grep 21

2007-12-25T00:43:00.000Z	magic_ninja	wols	what if someone happened to compile and install it on my machine for an unknown reason?
2007-12-25T00:43:00.000Z	magic_ninja	wols	would it still show up on my service menu
2007-12-25T00:44:00.000Z	wols	magic_ninja	then it's his job to remove it again the way he installed it

2007-12-25T00:44:00.000Z	magic_ninja	wols	what if this was an unknown install to me (theoretically)
2007-12-25T00:45:00.000Z	wols	magic_ninja	and learn what "rc" means. now go away
2007-12-25T00:45:00.000Z	magic_ninja	wols	wow no need to be rude
