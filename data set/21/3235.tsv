2009-10-21T03:38:00.000Z	Halitech	thijs_	can you boot from a live cd and run fsck on the drive?
2009-10-21T03:39:00.000Z	thijs_	Halitech	i haven't done that yet, does that work even  ?
2009-10-21T03:39:00.000Z	Halitech	thijs_	it should as long as you specify the correct drive
2009-10-21T03:40:00.000Z	Halitech	thijs_	what kind of laptop and what kind of video card?
2009-10-21T03:41:00.000Z	Halitech	thijs_	did you install the ati drivers before you rebooted?
2009-10-21T03:42:00.000Z	Halitech	thijs_	ok, then it shouldn't be an issue with the ati drivers
2009-10-21T03:43:00.000Z	thijs_	Halitech	does that mean i didn't install the ati drivers on 8.10, or after the 9.04 install?
2009-10-21T03:45:00.000Z	Halitech	thijs_	the ati drivers were better in 8.10 and below, when 9.04 introduced the new version of Xorg, things started breaking, especially for cards under the HD series
2009-10-21T03:46:00.000Z	thijs_	Halitech	auch, alright, so how would i fix this? because installing 9.04 from livecd gave me the same problem
2009-10-21T03:46:00.000Z	Halitech	thijs_	don't use 9.04
2009-10-21T03:46:00.000Z	thijs_	Halitech	should i try 9.10?
2009-10-21T03:47:00.000Z	Halitech	thijs_	worth a shot
2009-10-21T03:47:00.000Z	Halitech	thijs_	although 9.10 is using the newer version of Xorg so it may not work either unless the open source drivers are better
2009-10-21T03:48:00.000Z	thijs_	Halitech	alright, will try that this weekend, got no livecds here right now, so none os to download and mount them into my cd drive
2009-10-21T03:48:00.000Z	thijs_	Halitech	I was just upgrading because 8.10 was also failing on me with random freezes all the time..
2009-10-21T03:49:00.000Z	Halitech	thijs_	got a copy of 8.04?
2009-10-21T03:49:00.000Z	thijs_	Halitech	yes, but i lent it to a friend. -.=
2009-10-21T03:49:00.000Z	Halitech	thijs_	I know its an older version but I would go with it, seemed the most stable to me
2009-10-21T03:50:00.000Z	thijs_	Halitech	thank you for your time. This weekend i'll buy some new cds.. though pretty bad 'bout the driver issue.
2009-10-21T03:51:00.000Z	thijs_	Halitech	you see there's someone who got it working on 9.04, but the problem is, my laptop doesn't show me a terminal, which leaves me to a dead end on the tutorial
2009-10-21T03:51:00.000Z	Halitech	thijs_	yeah, bad timing by ati, xorg and everyone at the same time to leave old ati cards and their users out in the cold so to speak
