2008-08-19T02:28:00.000Z	jam3s2002		I need some help. I can't get X running after I manually built my kernel.
2008-08-19T02:29:00.000Z	joh6nn	jam3s2002	what'd you do with the kernel?
2008-08-19T02:29:00.000Z	jam3s2002	joh6nn	added alsa/oss directly into the kernel and changed my processor make. I'm an avid gentoo user, so I'm fairly familiar with kernel config
2008-08-19T02:30:00.000Z	joh6nn	jam3s2002	i'm assuming there were no obvious errors during the compile?
2008-08-19T02:30:00.000Z	jam3s2002	joh6nn	none to speak of
2008-08-19T02:30:00.000Z	joh6nn	jam3s2002	what kind of errors are you getting now when X fails?
2008-08-19T02:30:00.000Z	jam3s2002	joh6nn	something about nvidia. let me retry to get something specific
2008-08-19T02:31:00.000Z	jam3s2002	joh6nn	failed to load the NVIDIA kernel module!
2008-08-19T02:33:00.000Z	joh6nn	jam3s2002	do you have an nvidia card?  or is the error all the more interesting for your lack of said hardware?
2008-08-19T02:34:00.000Z	jam3s2002	joh6nn	7800 GS OC
2008-08-19T02:35:00.000Z	jam3s2002	joh6nn	whenever I set the system up last night, I just let the package manager install the drivers, and everything worked until after I compiled the kernel today (to add x-fi support... don't even ask)
2008-08-19T02:37:00.000Z	joh6nn	jam3s2002	i've never compiled a kernel, myself, but it occurs to me that the nvidia driver is a binary blob; what are the chances it didn't get linked in properly?
2008-08-19T02:38:00.000Z	jam3s2002	joh6nn	pretty high. how do I like external modules back into the kernel? in gentoo, its modules-rebuild
2008-08-19T02:38:00.000Z	joh6nn	jam3s2002	not quite sure off the top of my head
2008-08-19T02:39:00.000Z	joh6nn	jam3s2002	looks like modprobe will do it for the current session
2008-08-19T02:40:00.000Z	jam3s2002	joh6nn	k, that's a start
2008-08-19T02:45:00.000Z	jam3s2002	joh6nn	modprobe didn't quite fix it. is there anyway to reinstall all of my binaries?
2008-08-19T02:46:00.000Z	joh6nn	jam3s2002	all of your binaries?  like, the entire install?
2008-08-19T02:46:00.000Z	jam3s2002	joh6nn	I managed to fix my issue by commenting out the nvidia line in xorg.conf. I'll fix that later, haha
2008-08-19T02:47:00.000Z	joh6nn	jam3s2002	ha! well, whatever gets it limping along for now, huh?
2008-08-19T02:47:00.000Z	jam3s2002	joh6nn	I use gentoo, my systems are always broken XD
