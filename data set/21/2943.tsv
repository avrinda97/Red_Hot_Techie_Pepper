2010-04-22T15:30:00.000Z	Curly_Q	Wipster	it seems that when you boot up that your screen blanking kicks in immediately. Have you tried shutting down those settings in the BIOS?
2010-04-22T15:31:00.000Z	Wipster	Curly_Q	I have not spotted any settings on screen blanking on boot, I havn't noticed any screen blanking when I boot
2010-04-22T15:32:00.000Z	Curly_Q	Wipster	when you boot can you access anything?
2010-04-22T15:33:00.000Z	Wipster	Curly_Q	Not sure what you mean, I can get into BIOS but I havn't spotted any options in there for screen blanking. When I boot into ubuntu I havn't noticed any problems with blanking, except this intermitant problem when the screen blanks and I wiggle my mouse to wake it up if i am reading
2010-04-22T15:34:00.000Z	Curly_Q	Wipster	I read the URL you posted. It has to do with Power Manager. That may be a BIOS setting.
2010-04-22T15:35:00.000Z	Curly_Q	Wipster	I ask this always to many who ask the same question you asked. Do you run a Dual Boot with Windows. If so check the Windows settings on Screen Management.
2010-04-22T15:36:00.000Z	Wipster	Curly_Q	No I am only booting ubuntu on this computer
2010-04-22T15:37:00.000Z	Curly_Q	Wipster	shut off power management in BIOS just to test this theory. Also Sleep Mode. You can always reset it back.
2010-04-22T15:42:00.000Z	Curly_Q	Wipster	is it a USB mouse? Have you tried to exchange the mouse for another mouse just to see if the mouse is a bad one?
2010-04-22T15:43:00.000Z	Curly_Q	Wipster	what you explained from a Technical viewpoint, you should check first the obvious, i.e., the mouse and if it is USB plug it into another USB port.
2010-04-22T15:46:00.000Z	Wipster	Curly_Q	I dont think its a mouse issue, but I will try anyway it does seem that its exhibiting the exact problem on the blog when it dims I hit the 50ms race with my wiggle to brighten it up, the timer doesn't reset and it proceeds to turn it off down the line
2010-04-22T15:47:00.000Z	Curly_Q	Wipster	is it a USB or PS/2 mouse?
2010-04-22T15:48:00.000Z	Wipster	Curly_Q	I have a usb mouse but I was using the mousepad, I think its connected to PS/2
2010-04-22T15:48:00.000Z	Curly_Q	Wipster	also are you running a laptop?
2010-04-22T15:48:00.000Z	Wipster	Curly_Q	yes
2010-04-22T15:50:00.000Z	Curly_Q	Wipster	if you remove the PS/2 mouse does the problem go away?
2010-04-22T15:51:00.000Z	Curly_Q	Wipster	NEVER remove any PS/2 mouse while the laptop is running. Power down first then remove.
2010-04-22T15:54:00.000Z	Wipster	Curly_Q	well I dont have a physical PS/2 mouse connector, I have no idea what my touch pad connects to internally though
2010-04-22T15:57:00.000Z	Curly_Q	Wipster	in Windows for example there are power settings for screen saver and power management and sleep mode. I believe that Ubuntu has the very same settings. They control the BIOS at bootup.
2010-04-22T15:58:00.000Z	Wipster	Curly_Q	ok well thanks for the help with this I'l live with it for the time being :)
2010-04-22T16:08:00.000Z	Curly_Q	Wipster	which brings us to another line of reasoning. If your CMOS battery is dead or weak, then, your computer time frame is off. If you check the date when you re-boot and see if the time and date is correct only after the computer has been sitting for a while like you said, you may find that could be your answer.
