2008-05-06T22:39:00.000Z	Romi		I'm currently installing Hardy Heron on an older Laptop. The problem is, the installation always gets stuck at "Lade sed ..." (german for "Loading sed.." I think). I tried serveral CDs (ubuntu, kubuntu, xubuntu) and it always gets stuck at this point, Any ideas?
2008-05-06T22:39:00.000Z	starcannon	Romi	have you tried the alternate install CD?
2008-05-06T22:40:00.000Z	Romi	starcannon	it is the alternate CD
2008-05-06T22:40:00.000Z	Romi	starcannon	its an older notebook, so a live-cd takes too long ;)
2008-05-06T22:41:00.000Z	starcannon	Romi	yeah, I hear ya, I put fluxbuntu  gutsy on an old celeron 333mhz and xubuntu feisty on an old PII 366mhz laptops respectively
2008-05-06T22:42:00.000Z	starcannon	Romi	what are the hardware specs on your notebook? i.e. CPU speed, Ram amount, HDD size, and Video processor?
2008-05-06T22:43:00.000Z	Romi	starcannon	AMD Athlon 2200+ , 512MB-RAM, 30Gig HDD, Radeon Mobility 9000
2008-05-06T22:45:00.000Z	starcannon	Romi	that computer should run a liveCD just fine, you have more than enough power for that, what I would suggest on the Hardy install CD is to press F4 at the CD's Boot Menu choose safe graphics mode, then select "install ubuntu" or "try ubuntu" from the main menu, I think that may get you rolling, but you definitely can run a live cd just fine with that machine, may need to choose some Fkey options on main menu is all
2008-05-06T22:46:00.000Z	starcannon	Romi	what Brand/Model is that laptop? I'll do a little googling
2008-05-06T22:48:00.000Z	Romi	starcannon	Targa Visionary XP
2008-05-06T22:51:00.000Z	starcannon	Romi	hehe I found a how to guide, all in German... could run it through Babel Fish, but its for Suse anyway, will keep hunting
2008-05-06T22:51:00.000Z	Romi	starcannon	I am german ;)
2008-05-06T22:53:00.000Z	starcannon	Romi	oh well, thats a horse of a different color, that means it would be a great guide for you, hang on I'll grab that link, its not for ubuntu, but its linux so if it works there it should work here.. brb with that link
2008-05-06T22:54:00.000Z	starcannon	Romi	:  check out this guide http://www.bauklimatik-dresden.de/privat/nicolai/html/de/targa.html
2008-05-06T22:54:00.000Z	Romi	starcannon	thanks so far ;)
2008-05-06T22:55:00.000Z	starcannon	Romi	with that vid card you will likely have to start in safe graphics mode, I know a lot of folks have a little trouble getting ATi cards going, best to save that issue for post install is my bet
2008-05-06T22:56:00.000Z	Romi	starcannon	yah, I had problems with my card in gutsy, too
2008-05-06T22:56:00.000Z	starcannon	Romi	as your probably well aware of, but just in case your not, there is a good wiki link from the ati.com site that tells how to set up their drivers in linux, one guide specifically for Ubuntu
2008-05-06T22:57:00.000Z	Romi	starcannon	well, the german site ubuntuusers.de has a very good wiki, which explains everything ;)
2008-05-06T22:57:00.000Z	starcannon		ahh good
2008-05-06T22:58:00.000Z	starcannon	Romi	I've run some German sites through Babel Fish here and there, sometimes you guys are the only ones that have info on a piece of hardware
