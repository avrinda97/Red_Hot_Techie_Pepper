2011-02-01T08:51:00.000Z	col0ur		Hello, i just upgraded to Maverick from Hardy (im on a netbook). Before, on Hardy, if i played a game under wine with a resolution of 800x600, it would stretch to fill my entire screen. However now under Maverick it just uses a square in the middle (actual 800x600). Any way i can fix this?

2011-02-01T08:54:00.000Z	bc81	col0ur	what wine version, what game?
2011-02-01T08:54:00.000Z	col0ur	bc81	wine1.3, Half Life
2011-02-01T08:56:00.000Z	bc81	col0ur	in winecfg, try unckecking "allow the window manager to control the windows"
2011-02-01T08:57:00.000Z	col0ur	bc81	testing now
2011-02-01T08:57:00.000Z	col0ur	bc81	unforunately it didn't work
2011-02-01T08:58:00.000Z	bc81	col0ur	check is there are bugs with your version of hl/wine: http://appdb.winehq.org/appview.php?appId=8
2011-02-01T08:59:00.000Z	col0ur	bc81	okay
2011-02-01T08:59:00.000Z	col0ur	bc81	i don't thing it's a wine issue
2011-02-01T08:59:00.000Z	col0ur	bc81	cause on Hardy it never happened
2011-02-01T09:02:00.000Z	bc81	col0ur	couple things to try:  disable compiz (if running), use wine 1.0, or 1.2
2011-02-01T09:03:00.000Z	col0ur	bc81	compiz isn't running
2011-02-01T09:55:00.000Z	bc81	col0ur	prehaps ask in #ubuntustudio
2011-02-01T09:55:00.000Z	col0ur	bc81	will do
2011-02-01T09:59:00.000Z	bc81	col0ur	i was thinking, maybe try in winecfg using a virtual desktop set to your native screen resolution
2011-02-01T10:00:00.000Z	col0ur	bc81	might be worth a shot
2011-02-01T10:00:00.000Z	bc81	col0ur	also, are there any settings in HL to change resolution, or go fullscreen etc?
2011-02-01T10:00:00.000Z	col0ur	bc81	800x600 only
2011-02-01T10:37:00.000Z	col0ur	bc81	800x600 only
