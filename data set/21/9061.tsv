2006-02-21T15:51:00.000Z	polpak	wastrel	you're talking about after you enter your user/pass but before it loads your theme?
2006-02-21T15:52:00.000Z	wastrel	polpak	 yes, where it shows the status window for gnome startup
2006-03-13T07:14:00.000Z	wastrel	polpak	 ah yes.  v. true.   talisein  to store the result of a command in a variable you use either  FOO=$(command)  or FOO=`command`b
2006-06-14T11:32:00.000Z	polpak	wastrel	yes
2006-06-14T11:32:00.000Z	polpak	wastrel	he can't get to anything outside his lan

2006-06-14T11:38:00.000Z	polpak	wastrel	no he can't
2006-06-14T11:38:00.000Z	polpak	wastrel	he doesn't have his default route set right
2006-06-21T12:05:00.000Z	polpak	wastrel	you want this too?
2006-06-21T12:05:00.000Z	wastrel	polpak	 yes!

2006-06-21T12:22:00.000Z	wastrel	polpak	 no, i'm still getting a password prompt
2006-06-21T12:23:00.000Z	polpak	wastrel	did you restart the acpi daemon?
2006-06-21T12:23:00.000Z	polpak	wastrel	can you pastebin both /etc/acpi/events/lidbtn and /etc/acpi/screenblank-nopass.sh ?
2006-06-21T12:31:00.000Z	wastrel	polpak	 http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16163   it didn't work :] 
2006-06-21T12:33:00.000Z	polpak	wastrel	that looks fine.. it should work if you restart the acpi daemons.. You may also need to restart acpi-support and apmd but it should really work with just acpid restarted
2006-06-24T12:10:00.000Z	polpak	wastrel	logical volumn management
