2007-08-21T13:54:00.000Z	lil-g-man		I've got few problems. I recently got a laptop and i decided to install feisty fawn on it. I tried to boot from the live cd and i got 2 errors. one error was something like X server error, something about not being able to find any screens. Any solutions?
2007-08-21T13:55:00.000Z	h1st0	lil-g-man	try starting in safe graphics mode
2007-08-21T13:55:00.000Z	h1st0	lil-g-man	fromt he main menu when you boot the cd
2007-08-21T13:55:00.000Z	lil-g-man	h1st0	> and that should work?
2007-08-21T13:55:00.000Z	h1st0	lil-g-man	yes unless you have some wierd video card.  Then you may have to fiddle a little to get it to work.
2007-08-21T13:56:00.000Z	lil-g-man	h1st0	it's nvidia 8400
2007-08-21T13:56:00.000Z	h1st0	lil-g-man	yeah try safe graphics
2007-08-21T13:56:00.000Z	h1st0	lil-g-man	after its up you can install nvidia-glx-new or something to get the proper support for your card
2007-08-21T14:01:00.000Z	h1st0	lil-g-man	the broadcom card you have won't work with out the firmware
2007-08-21T14:01:00.000Z	h1st0	lil-g-man	you can put the firmware in /lib/firmware/`uname-r`  or you can use ndiswrapper and install the windows driver for the card.
2007-08-21T14:01:00.000Z	lil-g-man	h1st0	so i should be able to install ubuntu if i fix that weird x server error no screen error?
2007-08-21T14:02:00.000Z	h1st0	lil-g-man	the X server error is just that it didn't find a proper video driver.  So there is no screen to load X server on.
2007-08-21T14:02:00.000Z	h1st0	lil-g-man	then if you have a bcm43xx chipset card you need the firmware for it.
2007-08-21T14:02:00.000Z	h1st0	lil-g-man	or use ndiswrapper
2007-08-21T14:02:00.000Z	h1st0	lil-g-man	did you try booting with the safe graphics mode option?
2007-08-21T14:03:00.000Z	lil-g-man	h1st0	not yet, is safe graphics mode something like command line or what?
2007-08-21T14:03:00.000Z	lil-g-man	h1st0	well not command line but text?
2007-08-21T14:05:00.000Z	h1st0	lil-g-man	no it will use a different driver to boot
2007-08-21T14:05:00.000Z	h1st0	lil-g-man	so you can get the right drivers workign after that.
2007-08-21T14:06:00.000Z	lil-g-man	h1st0	thanks, i'll try that... how about using alternate cd installation?
