2010-11-24T11:57:00.000Z	frankie____yul		anybody got any kind of wireless usb adapters working with 10.10?
2010-11-24T11:58:00.000Z	frankie____yul		Ok, any sugestion for wireless adapters? have tried two of them with ndiswrapper - no luck
2010-11-24T11:59:00.000Z	Gnea	frankie____yul	have you seen the list of supported wifi devices?
2010-11-24T12:00:00.000Z	Gnea	frankie____yul	do the math - if it works for an older release, it'll work for a newer release
2010-11-24T12:00:00.000Z	Gnea	frankie____yul	which netgear?
2010-11-24T12:04:00.000Z	Gnea	frankie____yul	it's possible you're pulling my chain.
2010-11-24T12:04:00.000Z	Gnea	frankie____yul	the lsusb command doesn't show it?
2010-11-24T12:16:00.000Z	Gnea	frankie____yul	well, get the card again and try again
2010-11-24T12:05:00.000Z	Gnea	frankie____yul	great, what's the usb id?
2010-11-24T12:08:00.000Z	Gnea	frankie____yul	returned it to where?
2010-11-24T12:08:00.000Z	Gnea	frankie____yul	so you don't have ANY wireless cards with you right now?
2010-11-24T12:09:00.000Z	Gnea	frankie____yul	I'm sorry you felt you had to jump to that incorrect conclusion
2010-11-24T12:09:00.000Z	Gnea	frankie____yul	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HardwareSupportComponentsWirelessNetworkCardsNetgear#USB  if it's in that list and says it's supported, then it will work
2010-11-24T12:10:00.000Z	Gnea	frankie____yul	if it doesn't work out-of-the-box then it's because 10.10 changed something, then getting someone in here along with the forums to help you would be the correct route to go, not to mention less costly
2010-11-24T12:12:00.000Z	Gnea	frankie____yul	checking it out...
2010-11-24T12:13:00.000Z	Gnea	frankie____yul	please read this again, at the VERY BOTTOM of the page: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HardwareSupportComponentsWirelessNetworkCardsNetgear#USB
2010-11-24T12:15:00.000Z	Gnea	frankie____yul	doesn't matter much, did you happen to ever try wicd?
2010-11-24T12:35:00.000Z	Gnea	frankie____yul	sometimes the vendor has a linux driver
2010-11-24T12:35:00.000Z	Gnea	frankie____yul	not with netgear/cisco
2010-11-24T12:36:00.000Z	Gnea	frankie____yul	it's just not always obvious
2010-11-24T12:38:00.000Z	Gnea	frankie____yul	d-link is bottom of the barrel
