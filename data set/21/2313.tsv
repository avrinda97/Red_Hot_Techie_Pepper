2010-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	losha	mka	you'd still have to keep the links updated if anything changed, so I don't see that you're much better off....
2010-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	mka	losha	I think when you install the a newer kernel those links are updated automatically
2010-01-01T07:01:00.000Z	losha	mka	maybe true when you update a ubuntu kernel, but if you're dual-booting say, bsd, you're gonna have to do some hand editing....
2010-01-01T07:02:00.000Z	mka	losha	why?
2010-01-01T07:03:00.000Z	mka	losha	at some point a had 6 operating systems on 1 machine with one grub in MBR
2010-01-01T07:03:00.000Z	mka	losha	but that was the older grub not this confusing new one
2010-01-01T07:03:00.000Z	losha	mka	because other distros, and even older versions of ubuntu can't be relied on to get the syntax correct when they update the grub config files....
2010-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	mka	losha	ok, my knowledge is limited when it goes to grub2 but with the older grub, there are no problems
2010-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	losha	mka	maybe you were just lucky. Plenty of people show up here claiming an update messed with their grub configs....
2010-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	mka	losha	nope, not lucky, since warty
2010-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	losha	mka	did I say lucky? I meant to say terribly clever....
2010-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	mka	losha	neither, i like your humour, ha, ha!
2010-01-01T07:23:00.000Z	losha	mka	I'm with Dr_Willis. There should be endless complaints in dmesg if the disk drops out....
2010-01-01T07:24:00.000Z	mka	losha	but I never ever seen that disk for the past 4 days, its a luck if it shows up (like a rain in the desert)
2010-01-01T07:24:00.000Z	mka	losha	sudo fdisk -l is blank
2010-01-01T07:25:00.000Z	mka	losha	I managed to quickly deleting its swap partition because it used to trap my livecd session when it vanishes
2010-01-01T07:26:00.000Z	losha	mka	does sound like bad hardware. Try smartmontools?
2010-01-01T07:26:00.000Z	mka	losha	Dr_Willis, kmyst, jordanwb anyway thanks for the input, I am planning of sending the laptop for repairs. It's definitely hardware.
2010-01-01T07:29:00.000Z	losha	mka	a hail mary  is a traditional Catholic prayer....
2010-01-01T07:30:00.000Z	mka	losha	oh
2010-01-04T02:18:00.000Z	losha	mka	search newegg for something that the reviewers say works well with ubuntu. I favor nvidia personally...
