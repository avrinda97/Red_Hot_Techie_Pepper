2007-10-19T02:42:00.000Z	jamili	sebastes	thanks for bothering :)
2007-10-19T02:42:00.000Z	sebastes	jamili	Hrm, have you tried booting with the live cd?
2007-10-19T02:43:00.000Z	jamili	sebastes	hmm? i booted to it and installed
2007-10-19T02:50:00.000Z	sebastes	jamili	Yeah, I can't find a proper response. Jmicron support is now currently in the kernel, so it might have something weird to do with the way grub set itself up.
2007-10-19T02:50:00.000Z	jamili	sebastes	ok
