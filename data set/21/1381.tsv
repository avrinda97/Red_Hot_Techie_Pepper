2010-10-07T09:05:00.000Z	Cancambo		After changing the settings it would just get stuck on trying to connect
2010-10-07T09:06:00.000Z	Cancambo		Like, the wave icon would just keeping going in and out doing the connecting animation
2010-10-07T09:06:00.000Z	Cancambo		And then it would say "Disconnected from TRENDnet" like 30 seconds later
2010-10-07T09:07:00.000Z	Cancambo		So how would I attempt to fix that?
2010-10-07T09:08:00.000Z	Cancambo		I think
2010-10-07T09:08:00.000Z	Cancambo		I'll go to the router control panel roght niow
2010-10-07T09:10:00.000Z	Cancambo		Ok I'll run that next time I go to Ubuntu
2010-10-07T09:11:00.000Z	Cancambo		Real quick
2010-10-07T09:11:00.000Z	Cancambo		http://pastebin.com/TzhLnFk8 is the log from my router
2010-10-07T09:12:00.000Z	Cancambo		Ok
2010-10-07T09:13:00.000Z	isaquealves	Cancambo	could you post the syslog  file of your ubuntu station?
2010-10-07T09:16:00.000Z	Cancambo	isaquealves	ok I'll try to do that
2010-10-07T09:41:00.000Z	Cancambo	isaquealves	see anything in my syslog file?
2010-10-07T09:42:00.000Z	isaquealves	Cancambo	I see that you are using some ndiswrapper driver... is this correct?
2010-10-07T09:46:00.000Z	Cancambo	isaquealves	this is a lsit of a bunch of commands I ran http://pastebin.org/77818
2010-10-07T09:49:00.000Z	isaquealves	Cancambo	the device driver doesn't support SSID scans
2010-10-07T09:55:00.000Z	isaquealves	Cancambo	ndiswrapper should be working...
2010-10-07T09:56:00.000Z	Cancambo	isaquealves	it works enough to recognize my card, and networks
2010-10-07T09:56:00.000Z	isaquealves	Cancambo	if it recognizes your network, try the following
2010-10-07T10:02:00.000Z	Cancambo	isaquealves	I got this http://imgur.com/t5x5P.png and then did this http://imgur.com/fMqFU.png
2010-10-07T10:21:00.000Z	Cancambo	isaquealves	I think that was the original settings
