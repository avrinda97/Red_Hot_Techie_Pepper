2005-10-18T15:57:00.000Z	jeff303		who here plays Warcraft 3 on Battle.net using Cedega?
2005-10-18T15:58:00.000Z	feugan3333	jeff303	I don't, but I'd like to know how it runs?
2005-10-18T15:58:00.000Z	jeff303	feugan3333	well so far it's pretty good for me
2005-10-18T15:58:00.000Z	jeff303	feugan3333	after some tweaking
2005-10-18T15:58:00.000Z	feugan3333	jeff303	pretty cool
2005-10-18T15:59:00.000Z	jeff303	feugan3333	but I've been having some lockups on Battle.net, wondering if they were common
2005-10-18T15:59:00.000Z	jeff303	feugan3333	don't remember them from Windows
2005-10-18T15:59:00.000Z	feugan3333	jeff303	might be Cedega's fault, never had lockups in while playing in windows.
2005-10-19T16:00:00.000Z	jeff303	feugan3333	well it was weird, not really locked up, like the snow was still blowing in the background
2005-10-19T16:00:00.000Z	jeff303	feugan3333	and games list was updating, but the buttons were greyed out and it never did anything
2005-10-19T16:02:00.000Z	feugan3333	jeff303	I always blame the emulator :-)
2005-10-19T16:02:00.000Z	jeff303	feugan3333	hah yeah, well frank was right
2005-10-19T16:02:00.000Z	jeff303	feugan3333	there is an issue because the timeout in linux is different or something
2005-10-19T16:03:00.000Z	feugan3333	jeff303	fixable?
2005-10-19T16:03:00.000Z	jeff303	feugan3333	check out the first bullet under Issues here

2005-10-19T16:03:00.000Z	jeff303	feugan3333	apparently the best solution currently is to kill the wine process externally, kind of messy
2005-10-19T16:07:00.000Z	feugan3333	jeff303	I don't really understand the problem, but it's cool to see games working (even if a little buggy at the moment)
2005-10-19T16:09:00.000Z	jeff303	feugan3333	yeah it's actually kind of a minor case, namely joining custom games where the host guy has the port blocked
2005-10-19T16:09:00.000Z	jeff303	feugan3333	and on Windows, it will basically timeout sooner
2005-10-19T16:09:00.000Z	jeff303	feugan3333	but who knows, maybe they will fix it, WC3 is one of the most popular titles
