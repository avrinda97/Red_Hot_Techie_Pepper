2006-05-12T10:45:00.000Z	ompaul	g0dchild	the answer is don't even try, get dapper if you really really want to do that
2006-05-12T10:47:00.000Z	ompaul	g0dchild	packages verus source
2006-05-12T10:50:00.000Z	ompaul	g0dchild	as long as you have not gone off and done lots of mad stuff from all sorts of repos you should be full of fun - and if your /home is seperate then I would go for fresh install leaving the home the same
2006-05-12T10:50:00.000Z	ompaul	g0dchild	you don't have to but you can

2006-05-24T14:21:00.000Z	ompaul	g0dchild	mostly I have seen people configure printers from within ubuntu with system administration printing
2006-05-27T11:40:00.000Z	ompaul	g0dchild	more helpful would be, I need a program that does function X, as most people don't know what adobe audition is
2006-05-27T05:47:00.000Z	g0dchild	ompaul	i am having a prob with alsa too...when i restart alsa, it tells me that it cant find any hardware devices- is it smth to do with the kernel?
2006-05-27T05:48:00.000Z	ompaul	g0dchild	I don't know, so the obvious question is this: did  u have it working and did you change the kernel
