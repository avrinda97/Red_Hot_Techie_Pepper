2008-04-02T14:21:00.000Z	xs142		How do I update CompizFusion in a newbiefriendly way?
2008-04-02T14:22:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	xs142	wait until the version you want to update to appears in the update manager :P
2008-04-02T14:23:00.000Z	xs142	LSD|Ninja	ActionParsnip - Sure but that thing doesn't have an up-to-date version for some reason..
2008-04-02T14:24:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	xs142	just how out of date is it? Don't expect it to show up as an update within 5 minutes of the developer putting it on sourceforge, stuff has to be tested
2008-04-02T14:25:00.000Z	xs142	LSD|Ninja	I think the version I get is from roughly June '07..
2008-04-02T14:25:00.000Z	xs142	LSD|Ninja	It's 0.5.2, there's been 0.6.0 and now 0.7.2 released, 0.7.2 is in dev
2008-04-02T14:30:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	xs142	they're probably saving it for Hardy
2008-04-02T14:31:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	xs142	if you want the latest stuff within minutes of it aappearing on the developers web sites, Gentoo is over there --> ;)
2008-04-02T14:31:00.000Z	xs142	LSD|Ninja	- Suuuch a hassle to switch now :P
2008-04-02T14:35:00.000Z	xs142	LSD|Ninja	- But there are releases on their site, I just dunno what to do when I've downloaded it
2008-04-02T14:36:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	xs142	are they in Ubuntu .deb format?
2008-04-02T14:36:00.000Z	xs142	LSD|Ninja	What?
2008-04-02T14:37:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	xs142	the compiz-fusion packages you have
2008-04-02T14:37:00.000Z	xs142	LSD|Ninja	I figured, but I have no idea how to check that
2008-04-02T14:38:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	xs142	I'm getting the impression that you're better off leaving well enough alone
2008-04-02T14:38:00.000Z	xs142	LSD|Ninja	Breaking things is just fun
2008-04-02T14:38:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	xs142	Again, Gentoo is onver there -->
2008-04-02T14:39:00.000Z	xs142	LSD|Ninja	Looks like it takes so long to do things in Gentoo.. :) http://wiki.compiz-fusion.org/Distributions is the link if you care to have a quick looksie
2008-04-02T14:45:00.000Z	xs142	LSD|Ninja	Ok ok screw that, think I just got it.. How do I save changes in /etc/apt/sources.list? Says I lack permission :(
2008-04-02T14:46:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	xs142	sudo your editor
2008-04-02T14:48:00.000Z	xs142	LSD|Ninja	marius Cheers
