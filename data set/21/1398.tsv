2010-10-03T21:49:00.000Z	Chaos2358		can someone please tell me how to remove the keyring thing?
2010-10-03T21:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Chaos2358	 if you mean have the keyring not ask for a unlock password.. set your password in it to be blank, use the 'passwords and encryption keys' icon - right click on the entry that says 'login:' and change the password to be empty
2010-10-11T06:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Chaos2358	 theres the #compiz channel
2010-10-11T07:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Chaos2358	 check various guids and tutorials and play with CCSm. thats how i learned it.. learned to turn most of the effetcts OFF also..
2010-10-11T07:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Chaos2358	 or ask the channel here.. dont expect PM's.
2010-10-18T22:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Chaos2358	 you did install the mp3 codec packages/libs?
2010-10-18T22:54:00.000Z	Chaos2358	Dr_Willis	 yes i can play mp3 and everything else recognizes them
2010-10-18T22:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Chaos2358	 depends on what he wants
2010-10-18T22:56:00.000Z	Chaos2358	Dr_Willis	 i was under the impression the only way to write to an external in ubuntu is if it's fat
2010-10-18T22:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Chaos2358	 you are confused. It can be any FS that ubuntu can use...
2010-10-18T22:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Chaos2358	  You can even boot/run linux from a eternal usbhd.
2010-10-18T22:57:00.000Z	Chaos2358	Dr_Willis	 ddilinger ok well that means i got bs'd when i came in with same question  they told me it had to be fat or fat32
2010-10-18T22:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Chaos2358	 depends on what your exact question was...
2010-10-18T22:58:00.000Z	Chaos2358	Dr_Willis	 ddilinger gotcha.
2010-10-18T22:58:00.000Z	Chaos2358	Dr_Willis	 any ideas on why my amarok wont recognize any mp3's?
2010-10-18T22:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Chaos2358	 you need to have the proper mp3 support libs and codecs packages installed.
2010-10-18T22:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Chaos2358	 i think this was covered in the kubuntu faq when i looked at it ages ago.
2010-10-18T22:59:00.000Z	Chaos2358	Dr_Willis	 is there a mp3 codec specifically for amarok? because i installed the mp3 codecs and they are recognized on everything else i use
2010-10-18T23:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Chaos2358	 proberly can install kubuntu-restricted-extras
2010-10-18T23:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Chaos2358	 there may be. I dont use amarok.
2010-10-18T23:00:00.000Z	Chaos2358	Dr_Willis	 gotcha thanks
