2010-06-21T18:19:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Dr_Willis	he could have ctrl alt backspace .. 8.04 still has that
2010-06-27T19:44:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Dr_Willis	i actually have a script 'uncprs' that does just that.
2010-07-12T18:03:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Dr_Willis	he stated he was logging into irc with root account.. but i'm unsure if he meant root or a admin group enabled user
2010-07-21T05:32:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Dr_Willis	i actually toyed around with byobu yesterday. it is nice
2010-07-21T05:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bastid_raZor	 yea. its a nice default setup for screen. i recall a few quirks with it. :)
2010-07-21T05:33:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Dr_Willis	yes, i agree some quirks that i didn't like too. i'm back to gnome-terminal
2010-07-21T05:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bastid_raZor	 for X - i use 'terminator' mainly these days. On console/ssh screen/byobu
2010-07-21T05:35:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Dr_Willis	i'll test that out tonight.
2010-07-22T04:12:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Dr_Willis	would you mind giving a screenshot of your desktop with terminator?
2010-07-22T04:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bastid_raZor	 its just a terminator window maxamized... whats to show...
2010-07-22T04:13:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Dr_Willis	gotcha..
2010-10-22T06:57:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Dr_Willis	yes
2010-10-22T06:58:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Dr_Willis	not a new kernel just a revision to the current kernel
2010-10-22T06:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bastid_raZor	 and the default in 10.10 is to not just show 1 kernel entry right? I wonder if im even using the newest kernel file. or if grub is some how staying with the old one.
2010-10-22T06:59:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Dr_Willis	i'm still on 10.04 so i do not know.
