2009-07-05T14:48:00.000Z	oldude67		know just lsmod
2009-07-05T14:48:00.000Z	oldude67	Stdht	just lsmod it should show if its using it.
2009-07-05T14:49:00.000Z	Stdht	oldude67	snd                    63268  19 snd_usb_audio,snd_hwdep,snd_hda_intel,snd_pcm_oss,snd_mixer_oss,snd_pcm,snd_seq_oss,snd_rawmidi,snd_seq,snd_timer,snd_seq_device
2009-07-05T14:49:00.000Z	oldude67	Stdht	shows its using it
2009-07-05T14:50:00.000Z	Stdht	oldude67	So there no alsa!
2009-07-05T14:50:00.000Z	oldude67	Stdht	you asked about oss not alsa
2009-07-05T14:50:00.000Z	oldude67		lol
2009-07-05T14:51:00.000Z	oldude67	Stdht	type alsa into the terminal and see if it gives you something
2009-07-05T14:51:00.000Z	Stdht	oldude67	I try to understand I have alsa with virtual oss api or alsa and oss installed both
2009-07-05T14:52:00.000Z	Stdht	oldude67	I see options for load unload etc
2009-07-05T14:52:00.000Z	oldude67	Stdht	probably both
2009-07-05T14:52:00.000Z	oldude67		you have both
2009-07-05T14:53:00.000Z	Stdht	oldude67	I configurer portaudio with optin no-oss and pa_devs says that there no devices.
2009-07-05T14:53:00.000Z	Stdht		SO I feel like th sound goes only through oss
2009-07-05T14:53:00.000Z	oldude67	Stdht	try configuring it with oss and see if it helps
2009-07-05T14:55:00.000Z	Stdht	oldude67	But with oss portaudio produces terrible crackling sound!!! So I need to try to use alsa instead oss
2009-07-05T14:57:00.000Z	oldude67	Stdht	well im not sure about your program just know the basics of the systems and the uses...as far as alsa and oss..check your settings and see if you can switch them or change them.other then that , i dont think i can help you.sorry
