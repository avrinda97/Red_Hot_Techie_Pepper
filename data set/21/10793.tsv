2004-11-12T11:31:00.000Z	scaroo	stuNNed	does the installer kernel detects your drive ? (use dmesg to check)
2004-11-12T11:31:00.000Z	stuNNed	scaroo	it detects it but just wants to wipe it clean
2004-11-29T16:28:00.000Z	scaroo	stuNNed	the shiped OO has already the patches from ximian, for the fonts i dunno
2004-11-29T16:29:00.000Z	stuNNed	scaroo	think ximian will continue to release patches now that they are part of novell?
2004-11-29T16:30:00.000Z	scaroo	stuNNed	yep, the OOO licence force them to, and dont forget that ximian guys are goooood guys :)
2004-11-29T16:32:00.000Z	stuNNed	scaroo	i need piix kernel support to be built into kernel and not as module, will that mess up ide_core, libata and the like modules?
2004-11-29T16:33:00.000Z	scaroo	stuNNed	i realle dunno about the piix support, sorry
2004-11-29T16:34:00.000Z	stuNNed	scaroo	logically speaking though, as long as the support is there in the kernel, built in or not, then corresponding modules should load right?  or just build all associated into kernel maybe...
2004-11-29T16:47:00.000Z	stuNNed	scaroo	yes, that's what i was looking for, thanks, and thanks thoreauputic
2004-11-29T16:48:00.000Z	scaroo	stuNNed	np, dont forget to share your OOO bianries ;)
2004-11-29T16:48:00.000Z	stuNNed	scaroo	will do, will do :)
2004-11-29T16:48:00.000Z	stuNNed	scaroo	i have new industrial theme, courtesy of another #ubuntu user, if you like
2004-11-29T16:51:00.000Z	scaroo	stuNNed	what has changed in industrial ?
2004-11-29T16:52:00.000Z	stuNNed	scaroo	well, a few things, an overhaul i guess, icons...titlebar color, slight change in border color
2004-11-29T16:53:00.000Z	scaroo	stuNNed	is it still so bright ?
2004-11-29T16:54:00.000Z	stuNNed	scaroo	the borders are a little darker, titlebar is a little darker, icons lighter maybe? one sec i'll put up a screenshot
2004-11-29T17:01:00.000Z	stuNNed	scaroo	http://uclinux.info/lance/ubuntu/ubuntu_images/new_industrial.png <-new ximian industrial theme (Industrial-Steel) ?
2004-11-29T17:04:00.000Z	scaroo	stuNNed	really subtle changes , but i sure like the new icons theme :)
2004-11-29T17:04:00.000Z	stuNNed	scaroo	you too :)
2004-11-29T17:09:00.000Z	scaroo	stuNNed	i dunno in this particular case but ./ is the cwd (current working directory) but maybe here the ./ is relative to a debian specific path wich may have the value of "/"
2004-11-29T17:30:00.000Z	stuNNed	scaroo	topyli and others: just 'dirty hacked' the new ximian industrial-steel theme, here goes: http://uclinux.info/lance/ubuntu/debs/industrial-steel_1-2_all.deb there is md5sum of package in same url dir
