2010-03-02T20:45:00.000Z	ujjain		I do not have a USB stick :) And I just need to fix grub2
2010-03-02T20:45:00.000Z	ujjain		that's why I wanna burn super grub cd
2010-03-02T20:46:00.000Z	ujjain		I have been googling Grub for 3 hours now and trying different commands.
2010-03-02T20:46:00.000Z	ujjain		Even the original recover from Windows howto. It does not work!
2010-03-02T20:47:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	ujjain	just execute sudo grub-install /dev/sda and then update-grub
2010-03-02T20:49:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	ujjain	root dir is not what you got there its maybe / but not a /dev/someUID path afaik
2010-03-02T20:50:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	ujjain	did you try what i suggested?
2010-03-02T20:51:00.000Z	ujjain	remoteCTRL1	It's in my Firefox, I will read http://linuxers.org/howto/how-recover-grub2-ubuntu-910-karmic-koala :)
2010-03-02T20:51:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	ujjain	good luck
2010-03-02T20:53:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	ujjain	hahaha nice one, yep... without supergrub disk you need to use grub directions but it isnt so hard to do basically i already gave you the precise commands;)
2010-03-02T20:53:00.000Z	ujjain	remoteCTRL1	http://linuxers.org/howto/how-recover-grub2-ubuntu-910-karmi << This assums you can chroot because you have no seperate /boot partition.
2010-03-02T20:54:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	ujjain	of course you can chroot, you even need to otherwise it wont work
2010-03-02T20:54:00.000Z	ujjain	remoteCTRL1	How do I chkroot with LVM?
2010-03-02T20:55:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	ujjain	you might need some lvm commands there, first fint the volume group with vgscan then vgchange then lvscan then youre supposed to be able to mount
2010-03-02T20:57:00.000Z	ujjain	remoteCTRL1	Thanks a lot! Can you please save those 2 links for me and give then to me when I come back after reboot? I cannot save bookmarks on a live CD.
2010-03-02T20:58:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	ujjain	gimme the links once more pls
2010-03-02T20:58:00.000Z	ujjain	remoteCTRL1	http://grub.enbug.org/Grub2LiveCdInstallGuide http://linuxers.org/howto/how-recover-grub2-ubuntu-910-karmic-koala
2010-03-02T20:58:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	ujjain	but why would you reboot now?
2010-03-02T20:58:00.000Z	ujjain	remoteCTRL1	I added the boot flag via disk utility, I feel it might make a difference.
2010-03-02T20:59:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	ujjain	nope it wont
2010-03-02T20:59:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	ujjain	very well:)
