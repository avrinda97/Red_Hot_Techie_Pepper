2007-09-05T13:27:00.000Z	age6racer		whoops. I'm having trouble with rt2500 drivers and ndiswrapper
2007-09-05T13:27:00.000Z	age6racer		can anyone help me?
2007-09-05T13:29:00.000Z	age6racer		ndsiwrapper -l gives the following: driver present   device (1814:0201) present (alternative driver; rt2500)
2007-09-05T13:31:00.000Z	age6racer		I was hoping that ndiswrapper would fix this
2007-09-05T13:31:00.000Z	age6racer		anybody else here have experience with ndiswrapper??
2007-09-05T13:32:00.000Z	maedhros	age6racer	Only bad experiences... :)
2007-09-05T13:32:00.000Z	age6racer		lol, yeah me too.
2007-09-05T13:32:00.000Z	maedhros	age6racer	What hardware do you have?
2007-09-05T13:33:00.000Z	age6racer		it's an onboard adapter in my laptop
2007-09-05T13:35:00.000Z	maedhros	age6racer	run lspci, see if you can figure out what wireless chip you got
2007-09-05T13:37:00.000Z	age6racer	maedhros	RalLink RT2500 802.11g Cardbus/mini-PCI (rev 01))
2007-09-05T13:39:00.000Z	age6racer	maedhros	Hold on a second! it seems to work (I just connected to my network with it. The problem seems to be in network-manager-gnome or nm-applet.
2007-09-05T13:40:00.000Z	age6racer		From the the from the system tray icon I only have the choice of manually configured network. No list of AP's etc
2007-09-05T13:41:00.000Z	maedhros	age6racer	RT wireless controllers are typically a problem :( Mine worked nice with one of the default wrappers, but no WPA possible...
2007-09-05T13:41:00.000Z	maedhros	age6racer	You know the SSID of your network?
2007-09-05T13:41:00.000Z	age6racer		yeah, and I dont need WPA
2007-09-05T13:42:00.000Z	age6racer		but I do need to be able to roam (so nm-applet is very useful to me)
2007-09-05T13:42:00.000Z	maedhros	age6racer	Okay, then I don't know, really.
