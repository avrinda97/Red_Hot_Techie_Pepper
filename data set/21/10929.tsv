2004-09-28T13:21:00.000Z	cybrjackle|lappy		i only asked you since you mentioned it ;)
2004-09-28T13:22:00.000Z	cybrjackle|lappy		lol, thx
2004-09-28T13:23:00.000Z	daniels	cybrjackle|lappy	what happens if you run 'sudo ddcprobe' in a terminal?
2004-09-28T13:24:00.000Z	daniels	cybrjackle|lappy	(is your last line 'edidfail', or do you have a list of resolutions in lines starting with 'timing' or 'ctiming'?)
2004-09-28T13:25:00.000Z	daniels	cybrjackle|lappy	oh, laptop
2004-09-28T13:26:00.000Z	daniels	cybrjackle|lappy	what sort of video chipset does your laptop use?
2004-09-28T13:27:00.000Z	daniels	cybrjackle|lappy	we'll have a fix for you :) thanks for the report
2004-09-28T13:33:00.000Z	daniels	cybrjackle|lappy	hm, we've just backported pretty much the entire nv driver from xorg cvs
2004-09-28T13:34:00.000Z	daniels	cybrjackle|lappy	could you please run sudo XFree86 :42 -ac -logfile /tmp/xfree86-nv-1680x1050.log -logverbose 999999999 ?
2004-09-28T13:34:00.000Z	daniels	cybrjackle|lappy	and email the output to daniel.stone@canonical.com, cc'ing fabbione@canonical.com
2004-09-28T13:34:00.000Z	cybrjackle|lappy	daniels	any other q&a on the cards?
2004-09-28T13:35:00.000Z	cybrjackle|lappy	daniels	on laptop or desktop
2004-09-28T13:35:00.000Z	daniels	cybrjackle|lappy	not really -- basically, once we get the nv driver into Warty (expected to happen in a week or such), we can detect your panel properly
2004-09-28T13:35:00.000Z	daniels	cybrjackle|lappy	um, so yeah, actually don't worry about the log
2004-09-28T13:43:00.000Z	daniels	cybrjackle|lappy	what happens if you run 'sudo xresprobe nv' on that machine?
2004-09-28T13:43:00.000Z	daniels	cybrjackle|lappy	(the desktop wit h the crt)
2004-09-28T13:43:00.000Z	cybrjackle|lappy	daniels	lappy or desktop?
2004-09-29T10:18:00.000Z	daniels	cybrjackle|lappy	could you please get http://people.no-name-yet.com/~daniels/xresprobe/xresprobe_0.4.8_i386.deb, install it on your desktop with sudo dpkg -i, then /msg me the output of 'sudo ddcprobe | grep dtiming' and 'sudo xresprobe dummy'?
2004-09-29T10:18:00.000Z	daniels	cybrjackle|lappy	it should work fine for monitor-defined whacky resolutions now :)
