2010-02-07T21:12:00.000Z	Eremite	anarki2004	its probably not your ISP.
2010-02-07T21:12:00.000Z	anarki2004	Eremite	have you heard of this problem before?
2010-02-07T21:13:00.000Z	Eremite	anarki2004	what is the error on the websites?  How are they not displaying correctly?  Do you have any Ad blocking software installed?  That could be your problem.
2010-02-07T21:14:00.000Z	anarki2004	Eremite	i'll check the error. I think its connection timed out
2010-02-07T21:14:00.000Z	anarki2004	Eremite	and this is with gmail/yahoo and a couple other major players, so it shouldn't be them
2010-02-07T21:16:00.000Z	anarki2004	Eremite	it loads a really long URL and displays a white page. No specific error
2010-02-07T21:18:00.000Z	Eremite	anarki2004	that DOES sound like an ISP problem but if it works on Windows (same machine) then its most6 likely a software problem.  Have you tried installing any other browsers in Ubuntu (Opera, Aurora)?  Are you working from a fresh install of Ubuntu or did you just upgrade?
2010-02-07T21:19:00.000Z	anarki2004	Eremite	this is a fresh install of ubuntu. Only tweaks so far have been visual stuff. I've tried chrome and firefox with similar results
2010-02-07T21:19:00.000Z	Eremite	anarki2004	is it possible for you to take a screenshot of one of the pages that are screwing up?
2010-02-07T21:19:00.000Z	anarki2004	Eremite	sure, one sec
2010-02-07T21:23:00.000Z	anarki2004	Eremite	it looks like this may in fact be an ISP issue. tinypic doesn't seem to want to let me upload.
2010-02-07T21:23:00.000Z	Eremite	anarki2004	are you running a firewall?
2010-02-07T21:24:00.000Z	anarki2004	Eremite	it should all be disabled. Packet filters are turned off. whatever settings my router has now work just fine in windows.
2010-02-07T21:26:00.000Z	anarki2004	Eremite	isn't that a windows thing?
2010-02-07T21:26:00.000Z	Eremite	anarki2004	isnt what a windows thing?  You lost me, man.
2010-02-07T21:27:00.000Z	anarki2004	Eremite	i was talking about the lack of a default login/pass
2010-02-07T21:27:00.000Z	Eremite	anarki2004	nope.  Most linux distros Ive used arew either "root" "toor" or nothing at all.
2010-02-07T21:28:00.000Z	anarki2004	Eremite	well then I guess i'm a n00b
2010-02-07T21:28:00.000Z	Eremite	anarki2004	me too?
