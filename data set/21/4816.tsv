2008-02-23T09:39:00.000Z	Bulwinkle		anyone using exaile?
2008-02-23T09:39:00.000Z	DiploCat	Bulwinkle	yeah I use exaile
2008-02-23T09:39:00.000Z	Bulwinkle	DiploCat	any idea why it isn't saving my settings?
2008-02-23T09:40:00.000Z	DiploCat		ahh... is there a .exaile/ directory in your home dir?
2008-02-23T09:40:00.000Z	Bulwinkle	DiploCat	yes
2008-02-23T09:40:00.000Z	Bulwinkle	DiploCat	and it contains a settings.ini
2008-02-23T09:41:00.000Z	DiploCat	Bulwinkle	if you do ls -l ... does that file looks like it's been updated recently? are the permissions ok?
2008-02-23T09:43:00.000Z	Bulwinkle	DiploCat	-rw-r--r--  1 bmoore bmoore    1598 2008-02-22 16:42 settings.ini ....
2008-02-23T09:43:00.000Z	DiploCat	Bulwinkle	err... what settings isn't it keeping?
2008-02-23T09:43:00.000Z	Bulwinkle	DiploCat	I had to exit manually (quit) it doesn't seem to do it when I just exit Gnome....
2008-02-23T09:44:00.000Z	Bulwinkle		and why is my clock set to GMT and not my local time?
2008-02-23T09:44:00.000Z	Bulwinkle	DiploCat	You'll have to pardon me, I'm a KDE convert and so I'm used to Amarok
2008-02-23T09:45:00.000Z	DiploCat	Bulwinkle	not entirely sure why it wouldn't keep them after Gnome logout... perhaps it's just bad code
2008-02-23T09:45:00.000Z	Bulwinkle	DiploCat	for example...  when I used to log out of KDE it would kill Amarok and when it started it would start out with the same song at the same place
2008-02-23T09:46:00.000Z	Bulwinkle		!ntp
2008-02-23T09:46:00.000Z	DiploCat		ahh
2008-02-23T09:46:00.000Z	DiploCat	Bulwinkle	I'm not sure if exaile does that... it should keep the playlist, but I don't think it remembers the place
2008-02-23T09:47:00.000Z	DiploCat		to be honest, I'm not a huge fan of exaile... it seems to be the best of a bad bunch
2008-02-23T09:47:00.000Z	Bulwinkle	DiploCat	my problem is that if I logout before quitting exaile, it doesn't remember anything that has changed since the last time I quit.  Does that make sense?
2008-02-23T09:48:00.000Z	DiploCat	Bulwinkle	well... what you're saying makes sense... but why that is happening I am not quite sure
2008-02-23T09:48:00.000Z	Bulwinkle	DiploCat	no problem, thanks for your help
