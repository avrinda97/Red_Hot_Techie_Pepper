2012-03-18T17:31:00.000Z	mirak		hi
2012-03-18T17:32:00.000Z	mirak		is there a way to run the ubuntu alternate installer from a running distribution ?
2012-03-18T17:32:00.000Z	mirak		debootstrap lacks the graphical and step by step process
2012-03-18T17:32:00.000Z	bazhang	mirak	you mean to a usb key?
2012-03-18T17:33:00.000Z	mirak	bazhang	what ? no
2012-03-18T17:34:00.000Z	bazhang	mirak	then more details please
2012-03-18T17:35:00.000Z	mirak	bazhang	I have a multi boot, and i want to install ubuntu on another partition. THat's lvm partition on mdam raid
2012-03-18T17:36:00.000Z	mirak	bazhang	deboostrap is part of what I need of course, but deboostrap doesn't automatically creates fstab, doesn't install kernel, it needs to chroot etcetera.
2012-03-18T17:36:00.000Z	mirak	bazhang	I want to have the same facilities than an alternate iso installer, but from within a running ubuntu.
2012-03-18T17:40:00.000Z	mirak	bazhang	what i want is the step by step installer that is provided on the alternate cd, and be able to run it inside a running ubuntu. I wonder why it was never made
2012-03-18T17:40:00.000Z	mirak	bazhang	i will maybe just run an iso from grub
2012-10-15T18:48:00.000Z	mirak	bazhang	is it even needed to fill a bug for that ? do you really believe no Ubuntu devs ever noticed that ?
2012-10-15T18:49:00.000Z	bazhang	mirak	if you wish to troubleshoot we can. but saying that something is hopelessly broken wont get any support
2012-10-15T18:50:00.000Z	mirak	bazhang	troobleshot what ? it just doesn't work at all
2012-10-15T18:50:00.000Z	mirak	bazhang	a user needs to plug the device and show it pop up in nautilus, that's it
2012-10-15T18:50:00.000Z	bazhang	mirak	it certainly does for some. how about listing what exact device does not work, and we can go from there
2012-10-15T18:51:00.000Z	mirak	bazhang	a Nexus 7, that's a really uncomon device. Anyway Windows manage to open any device, so what's the issue then ?
2012-10-15T18:52:00.000Z	bazhang	mirak	I will check the listed bugs if you wait a moment
2012-10-15T18:53:00.000Z	mirak	bazhang	i mean, they waste time with unity that we don't need, and they miss what is really needed, it doesn't makes sens
2012-10-15T18:53:00.000Z	bazhang	mirak	did you need help, or just wish to complain. I will help if you decide the former
2012-10-15T18:58:00.000Z	mirak	bazhang	i want to know if it's fixed in Quantal, so i might try the quantal libmtp
