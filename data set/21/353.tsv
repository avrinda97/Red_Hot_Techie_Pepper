2012-02-18T13:14:00.000Z	svrnmnd		can anyone help me with permission problems in ubuntu 10.04?
2012-02-18T13:14:00.000Z	svrnmnd		(I think its permission problems)
2012-02-18T13:16:00.000Z	svrnmnd		ok so I am using a variant of ubuntu 10.04 NodeZero which is a pentesting distro. the 2 problems I am experiencing is I can not get the login screen to sync my ubuntu one folder, also when I add a torrent on transmission I get ERROR:Permission denied, I tried to change the download folder but still same problem
2012-02-18T13:16:00.000Z	svrnmnd		its 10.04 exactly just with pentesting tools cooked in
2012-02-18T13:17:00.000Z	iceroot	svrnmnd	not supported here
2012-02-18T13:17:00.000Z	iceroot	svrnmnd	not supported here
2012-02-18T13:19:00.000Z	iceroot	svrnmnd	its not supported here
2012-02-18T13:19:00.000Z	iceroot	svrnmnd	we dont know the differences, someone said its with a special user, we dont know anything about that user and the permissions of that user
2012-02-18T13:20:00.000Z	iceroot	svrnmnd	and because you are using this special user, we can not and will not support it here, please ask there channel
2012-02-18T13:20:00.000Z	iceroot	svrnmnd	/home/username  never!! change something in /home directly
2012-02-18T13:21:00.000Z	iceroot	svrnmnd	and /home/username should have write-permissions for the current user you are logged in
2012-02-18T13:21:00.000Z	iceroot	svrnmnd	if not, ask the channel of your distro
2012-02-18T13:23:00.000Z	iceroot	svrnmnd	chmod will change the permissions, chown to change the owner
2012-02-18T13:25:00.000Z	iceroot	svrnmnd	chmod o+w filename  for example
2012-02-18T13:26:00.000Z	iceroot	svrnmnd	please ask your distro channel, something seems to be wrong, the owner of a real ubuntu system always have write access to its home-dir
2012-02-18T13:27:00.000Z	svrnmnd	iceroot	I have write access, no problem creating new docs or saving things. I just think its a small discrep. could you give me a terminal command to make my home folder RW?
2012-02-18T13:28:00.000Z	iceroot	svrnmnd	sudo chmod -R o+w ~
2012-02-18T13:28:00.000Z	svrnmnd	iceroot	thanks
2012-02-18T13:33:00.000Z	svrnmnd	iceroot	do i have to do this everytime? or is it all good now???
2012-02-18T13:33:00.000Z	iceroot	svrnmnd	everything good and please use the channel of your distro
2012-02-18T13:34:00.000Z	iceroot	svrnmnd	if you want support here, use ubuntu
