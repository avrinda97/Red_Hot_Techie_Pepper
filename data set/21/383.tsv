2012-01-26T01:08:00.000Z	DJango_Novice		hi there....Im new to  ubuntu and trying to setup SVN but it says Errors were encountered while processing: libapache2-svn
2012-01-26T01:08:00.000Z	DJango_Novice		any idea
2012-01-26T01:08:00.000Z	lagbox	DJango_Novice	did you search google or the ubuntu forums for the problem ?
2012-01-26T01:10:00.000Z	lagbox	DJango_Novice	i would imagine you dont need apache2 to use svn
2012-01-26T01:11:00.000Z	DJango_Novice	lagbox	I was following a tutorial so i tried that
2012-01-26T01:24:00.000Z	lagbox	DJango_Novice	there might be a better tutorial in the ubuntu server guidee
2012-01-26T01:13:00.000Z	lagbox	DJango_Novice	is it forcing you to install libapache2-svn or are you telling it to install that specific package ?
2012-01-26T01:14:00.000Z	DJango_Novice	lagbox	u know what ....Iam new to SVN as well since Im a C# developer
2012-01-26T01:14:00.000Z	DJango_Novice	lagbox	so i was following a tutorial n it says install subversion and libapache-svn
2012-01-26T01:15:00.000Z	lagbox	DJango_Novice	don't install libapache2-svn ... just subversion and see what happens
2012-01-26T01:15:00.000Z	DJango_Novice	lagbox	I tried that as well
2012-01-26T01:16:00.000Z	lagbox	DJango_Novice	next question .. do you have apache2 installed ?
2012-01-26T01:16:00.000Z	lagbox	DJango_Novice	i was assuming there was a way to connect to svn without http
2012-01-26T01:16:00.000Z	DJango_Novice	lagbox	i was playing with apache as well
2012-01-26T01:17:00.000Z	lagbox	DJango_Novice	why
2012-01-26T01:18:00.000Z	DJango_Novice	lagbox	I dont know.. it should work with http.. why not
2012-01-26T01:22:00.000Z	DJango_Novice	lagbox	any idea???
2012-01-26T01:22:00.000Z	lagbox	DJango_Novice	im thinking ....
2012-01-26T01:26:00.000Z	lagbox	DJango_Novice	trying to ... i got svn up and running without a problem ...but i also don't know what exact error you are getting
2012-01-26T01:29:00.000Z	lagbox	DJango_Novice	make sure to move your apache config files if you have edited them ... let the reinstall start the config fresh
2012-01-26T01:30:00.000Z	DJango_Novice	lagbox	yes :) i will get back to you in a bit.. lets see how it goes
