2008-11-11T05:58:00.000Z	tCzern		In Gnome, I want to log out as user and log on as root. But then it tells me the System Admin is not allowed to logon from this screen, how does this work?
2008-11-11T05:59:00.000Z	tCzern		I must be invisble ... HELLO?
2008-11-11T06:00:00.000Z	tCzern		aah, hi
2008-11-11T06:00:00.000Z	nickrud	tCzern	not a good idea to log into gnome as root, very dangerous. You set it in the Login Manger in the admin menu

2008-11-11T06:00:00.000Z	nickrud	tCzern	better to learn the command line, and use gksu to run some apps gingerly as root
2008-11-11T06:01:00.000Z	tCzern		I want to asign an icon to an application launcher
2008-11-11T06:01:00.000Z	nickrud	tCzern	in the menu?
2008-11-11T06:01:00.000Z	tCzern		yes
2008-11-11T06:01:00.000Z	tCzern		I got alacarte
2008-11-11T06:01:00.000Z	nickrud		!cn | WolfHack
2008-11-11T06:01:00.000Z	nickrud		sorry WolfHack , WooAnn_ ^^
2008-11-11T06:01:00.000Z	tCzern		but it won't let me copy an icon into /usr
2008-11-11T06:02:00.000Z	nickrud	tCzern	that's not how it's done. You would use alacarte to edit your local menu, and the overriding launcher ends up in ~/.local ? ~/.share? somewhere
2008-11-11T06:03:00.000Z	tCzern	confuded	sure I know sudo, but I have no idea how to copy one image from a folder to another
2008-11-11T06:03:00.000Z	tCzern		in admin I don't have session, only login window
2008-11-11T06:03:00.000Z	nickrud	tCzern	cp.  you can also use gksu nautilus to get a graphical root file manager, but use GINGERLY
2008-11-11T06:04:00.000Z	tCzern		ok, will try
2008-11-11T06:05:00.000Z	tCzern		Login window did the trick too, found a security option.
2008-11-11T06:05:00.000Z	tCzern		thanks again!!
2008-11-11T06:06:00.000Z	nickrud	tCzern	if you break your system, don't blame me !!
