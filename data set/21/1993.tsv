2010-03-17T04:53:00.000Z	madjoe		is there any way to force Nautilus to show two different locations in the same window?
2010-03-17T04:54:00.000Z	eremite	madjoe	use tabs?
2010-03-17T04:55:00.000Z	madjoe	eremite	I need it to drag and drop easily without raising any other window... how can I use tabs?
2010-03-17T04:57:00.000Z	madjoe	eremite	I know, but it's not what I want.. I'd like to know if there's any way I could do something like this http://www.qweas.com/downloads/system/file-disk-management/scr-xplorer2-lite.jpeg
2010-03-17T04:58:00.000Z	eremite	madjoe	you should look into an app named Krusader
2010-03-17T04:58:00.000Z	madjoe	eremite	ok.. I hope it's not a big app
2010-03-17T04:59:00.000Z	eremite	madjoe	 also see emelFM2
2010-03-17T04:59:00.000Z	madjoe	eremite	which one is better?

2010-03-17T05:09:00.000Z	eremite	madjoe	yeah.  The ones I mentioned are in that list.  You obviously have a choice :D
2010-03-17T05:09:00.000Z	madjoe	eremite	I'm looking this XFE... not sure which one is the best
2010-03-17T05:14:00.000Z	eremite	madjoe	I would go with the one best suited to yoru desktop environment (Gnome, KDE, XFCE etc.)  You probably use Gnome with Ubuntu, so Gnome based apps may be the best for integration with your system.
2010-03-17T05:15:00.000Z	madjoe	eremite	that's right.. gnome.. so my choice has been reduced to xfe, I guess
2010-03-17T05:19:00.000Z	madjoe	eremite	take a look: http://berndth.blogspot.com/2009/06/nautilus-split-view-update.html
2010-03-17T05:41:00.000Z	madjoe	eremite	ha! you didn't know this.. check this out - http://subbass.blogspot.com/2009/12/howto-split-pane-nautilus.html
2010-03-17T05:41:00.000Z	madjoe	eremite	Nautilus has a dual pane already for Karmic, but it was written for Lucid
2010-03-17T05:42:00.000Z	eremite	madjoe	wow, that's really awesome.  Thanks for sharing!  I had no idea.  I feel bad for telling people to install other packages, now.
2010-03-17T05:42:00.000Z	madjoe	eremite	yes, I wanted to share that with you not to spread bad recommendations ;) I love this info
2010-03-17T05:43:00.000Z	eremite	madjoe	that's exactly what the free software qand open source community is about.  We need to share info about the software we use so that people can use it better.
2010-03-17T05:44:00.000Z	madjoe	eremite	yes, I agree
2010-03-17T05:44:00.000Z	madjoe	eremite	sometimes I see open source as a big communist organization that does no harm.. lol
