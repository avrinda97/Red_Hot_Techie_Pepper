2005-02-24T17:50:00.000Z	tobbe		?
2005-02-24T17:51:00.000Z	bascule	tobbe	no many users can sudo but only ever one super user uid=0 root
2005-02-24T17:59:00.000Z	bascule	tobbe	depends what time.h it wants they exist for a few things, libc6-dev, glibc-dev
2005-02-24T06:00:00.000Z	tobbe	bascule	How do I find that out?
2005-02-24T06:03:00.000Z	tobbe	bascule	I already have that installed
2005-02-24T06:15:00.000Z	tobbe	bascule	Still can't find time.h I've got glibc, stlport and libc6 installed
2005-02-24T06:21:00.000Z	bascule	tobbe	what are you trying to build
2005-02-24T06:25:00.000Z	tobbe	bascule	I'm trying to build linuxdcpp
2005-02-24T06:29:00.000Z	tobbe	bascule	http://linuxdcpp.berlios.de
2005-02-24T06:30:00.000Z	bascule	tobbe	needs a cvs checkout right?
2005-02-24T06:33:00.000Z	tobbe	bascule	yeah, it needs a cvs checkout, but it's really small. Will only take a couple of secs on a .5MBit connection
2005-02-24T06:35:00.000Z	bascule	tobbe	all right then ... ;)
2005-02-24T06:39:00.000Z	bascule	tobbe	client/QueueManager.h:174: warning: taking address of temporary
2005-02-25T17:24:00.000Z	bascule	tobbe	dpkg -i
2005-02-25T17:27:00.000Z	tobbe	bascule	do you remember that you tried to install linuxdcpp yesterday but it didn't work because you got a compilation error? I asked in #linuxdc++ today, and they said it was a known error that only causes ubuntu users. They had no idea why it happened :(
2005-02-25T17:33:00.000Z	bascule	tobbe	sorry i was off, not true about only ubuntu, it failed for me under another distro too
2005-02-25T17:35:00.000Z	tobbe	bascule	which one?
2005-02-25T17:36:00.000Z	bascule	tobbe	sourcemage
2005-02-25T17:36:00.000Z	bascule	tobbe	nope all tarballs
2005-02-25T17:43:00.000Z	bascule	tobbe	looks like i
