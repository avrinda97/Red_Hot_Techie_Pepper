2008-12-24T02:36:00.000Z	Hangwire	ASULutzy	if you havent seen it.
2008-12-24T02:37:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Hangwire	I saw it, don't spam paste... Does your file really have all those extra blank lines?
2008-12-24T02:37:00.000Z	Hangwire	ASULutzy	No, not at all. I guess the paste thing put them.
2008-12-24T02:38:00.000Z	Hangwire	ASULutzy	any ideas?
2008-12-24T02:39:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Hangwire	Weird, I could give you my .rtorrent.rc, but I don't see what's going on with your's, what was the error again? and you're just typing rtorrent into a terminal right?
2008-12-24T02:39:00.000Z	Hangwire	ASULutzy	Yes, just typing rtorrent into a terminal. rtorrent: Error in option file: ~/.rtorrent.rc:4: Invalid start of name.
2008-12-24T02:41:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Hangwire	Weird, I guess I can paste mine which I know works and you can edit it however you think is appropriate
2008-12-24T02:41:00.000Z	Hangwire	ASULutzy	thank you, but I am doing it the right way? renaming it to .rtorrent.rc, moving it to Home?
2008-12-24T02:42:00.000Z	Hangwire	ASULutzy	and okay, give me yours. might as well try.

2008-12-24T02:45:00.000Z	Hangwire	ASULutzy	Thank you very very much! Suprisingly it worked!
2008-12-24T02:45:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Hangwire	glad to hear it, enjoy rtorrent, it's amazing :)
2008-12-24T02:46:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Hangwire	rtorrent + screen +ssh = ability to manage torrents on  my home server from any computer connected to the internet, it's great
2008-12-24T02:48:00.000Z	Hangwire	ASULutzy	Sounds very nice, and i like CLI programs. Again, thank you.
