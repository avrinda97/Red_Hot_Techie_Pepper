2007-07-29T07:12:00.000Z	File13		I asked this yesterday but to finalize as im making the partiton my swap partiton if i have a 1gb stick of ram but a 60gb HDD am i safe making the swap partition 512 or should i double the amount of my ram (2gb)
2007-07-29T07:13:00.000Z	File13		would 1gb vs 512 make a real difference though?
2007-07-29T07:13:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	File13	i'd go with 1.5x ram, but 512 is probably ok.
2007-07-29T07:14:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	File13	if things get bogged down it could.
2007-07-29T07:15:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	File13	more or less.
2007-07-29T07:15:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	File13	why are you worrying over 512mb vs 1.5gigs?.. youu have 60ggs free
2007-07-29T07:16:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	File13	thats probably plenty
2007-07-29T07:16:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	File13	is that whole 60gigs for Ubuntu?
2007-07-29T07:17:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	File13	ok.
2007-07-29T07:18:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	File13	60 is PLENTY for ubuntu, give 1.5gigs for the swap, and the rest to ubuntu, you'll be fine.
2007-07-29T07:18:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	File13	are you gonna have some free space on that Xp partition?
2007-07-29T07:19:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	File13	ok, do as you wish.
2007-07-29T07:20:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	File13	wel, if you end up needing to go back to XP, either for gaming, or whatever.. yuou want plenty of room to install new software, etc.
2007-07-29T07:21:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	File13	ok...
2007-07-29T07:23:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	File13	how experienced with Linux are you?
2007-07-29T07:24:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	File13	just remember, i can microwave a pizza, but it doesn't make me a chef
2007-07-29T07:25:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	File13	no, not at all, i absolutely encourage you to do this i just don't want you to screw yourself
2007-07-29T07:26:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	File13	ok, then attack it.
2007-07-29T07:32:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	File13	are you saying if you wanted to give space back to Windows, from Ubuntu?
2007-07-29T07:33:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	File13	you could use gparted to give ext3 space back to XP
2007-07-29T07:40:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	File13	what ShackJack said
