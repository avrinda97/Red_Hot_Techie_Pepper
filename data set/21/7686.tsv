2006-08-04T16:06:00.000Z	Firenu		thx
2006-08-04T16:07:00.000Z	Firenu		apt-cache gives me nothing, do i need to set it up or something ?
2006-08-04T16:07:00.000Z	Firenu		(hi, i started with linux today :P )
2006-08-04T16:08:00.000Z	Firenu		well i did have debian running a long while ago, but just for simple services, and i messed up the security settings
2006-08-04T16:10:00.000Z	Firenu		!dapper > firenu
2006-08-04T16:10:00.000Z	Firenu		hm :<
2006-08-04T16:10:00.000Z	Firenu		its 6.06
2006-08-04T16:12:00.000Z	Firenu		 thundr excellent =)
2006-08-04T16:14:00.000Z	Firenu		okay lets say i want the real one, any hassles or unsupported things or anything ?
2006-08-04T16:14:00.000Z	thundr	Firenu	not really.
2006-08-04T16:08:00.000Z	thundr	Firenu	is there a reason you need to use apt-cache?
2006-08-04T16:08:00.000Z	Firenu	thundr	im trying to install xchat =)
2006-08-04T16:09:00.000Z	thundr	Firenu	are you using Dapper?
2006-08-04T16:09:00.000Z	Firenu	thundr	havent the slightest. i just started with ubuntu some moments ago.
2006-08-04T16:10:00.000Z	thundr	Firenu	Dapper's the common name of the latest released version of Ubuntu
2006-08-04T16:10:00.000Z	thundr	Firenu	if you've just downloaded Ubuntu, chances are it's Dapper
2006-08-04T16:10:00.000Z	thundr	Firenu	yes, that's the one.
2006-08-04T16:11:00.000Z	thundr	Firenu	if you don't want to get complicated, under the applications menu is add-remove programs
2006-08-04T16:13:00.000Z	thundr	Firenu	just type in xchat and you'll get the xchat-gnome package installed.  It's a simpler verion of xchat, but if you want the real thing, just click show community (unsupported) applications
2006-08-04T16:14:00.000Z	thundr	Firenu	I'm running plenty of "unsupported" software right now.
