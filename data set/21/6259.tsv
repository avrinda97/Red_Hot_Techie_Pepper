2007-05-28T08:48:00.000Z	oriez		how do i make the alt+shift commend to switch between languages?
2007-05-28T08:49:00.000Z	Lilacor	oriez	go into your SCIM setup and change it to be as such.
2007-05-28T08:51:00.000Z	oriez	Lilacor	i don't find nothing there
2007-05-28T08:51:00.000Z	Lilacor	oriez	you don't have an SCIM setup?
2007-05-28T08:53:00.000Z	oriez	Lilacor	i dont find the switch lang setting
2007-05-28T08:54:00.000Z	Lilacor	oriez	do you have SCIM setup first of all
2007-05-28T08:54:00.000Z	oriez	Lilacor	yes
2007-05-28T08:55:00.000Z	Lilacor	oriez	then look under Global Setup
2007-05-28T08:55:00.000Z	oriez	Lilacor	ok
2007-05-28T08:59:00.000Z	oriez	Lilacor	ok and then
2007-05-28T09:00:00.000Z	Lilacor	oriez	take a screenshot and show me what your scim global setup looks like
2007-05-28T09:01:00.000Z	Lilacor	oriez	or setup vncserver on your machine so I can see what's going on
2007-05-28T09:01:00.000Z	oriez	Lilacor	there you go - http://img525.imageshack.us/img525/7884/screenshotiq0.png
2007-05-28T09:02:00.000Z	Lilacor	oriez	go to Global Setup underneath "Front End"
2007-05-28T09:02:00.000Z	Lilacor	oriez	not under IMEngine
2007-05-28T09:03:00.000Z	oriez	Lilacor	ok and then
2007-05-28T09:03:00.000Z	Lilacor	oriez	it should be obvious from there
2007-05-28T09:04:00.000Z	Lilacor	oriez	it lists Next Input Method
2007-05-28T09:04:00.000Z	Lilacor	oriez	change the key bindings underneath that and you'll get what you want
2007-05-28T09:06:00.000Z	oriez	Lilacor	but how do i make it changing languages
2007-05-28T09:09:00.000Z	Lilacor	oriez	you bring up the language input bar, then you use the keybindings you set
