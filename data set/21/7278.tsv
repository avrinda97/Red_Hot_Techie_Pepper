2006-10-29T14:48:00.000Z	pecisk	SirYes	you mean by dist-upgrade? Yes, I have
2006-10-29T14:48:00.000Z	SirYes	pecisk	I did two fresh installs recently (plus one dist-upgrade) and two times it gave me the same problem
2006-10-29T14:49:00.000Z	pecisk	SirYes	what kind of problem?
2006-10-29T14:50:00.000Z	SirYes	pecisk	glad you've asked
2006-10-29T14:50:00.000Z	SirYes	pecisk	gparted doesn't let me through without creating a partition for / - root fs.
2006-10-29T14:52:00.000Z	SirYes	pecisk	even if I have a spare partition for Edgy, it forces me to delete a partition and to recreate it - then the installation proceeds.
2006-10-29T14:52:00.000Z	pecisk	SirYes	it is not such way that you should specify which partition will be root?
2006-10-29T14:53:00.000Z	pecisk	SirYes	hmmmm, feels like a bug, but I honestly can be sure, have no livecd to check it out
2006-10-29T14:53:00.000Z	pecisk	SirYes	try to report it to Launchpad
2006-10-29T14:53:00.000Z	SirYes	pecisk	yes, I can select "/" and "/home" from the combo boxes, but it's not enough for the installer :-(
2006-10-29T14:54:00.000Z	SirYes	pecisk	OTOH when I recreate the partition, its "format" checkbox becomes both selected and grayed out - then it goes.
2006-10-29T14:55:00.000Z	SirYes	pecisk	thanks for the suggestion, how do I "report to Launchpad"? Just a normal bug report?
2006-10-29T14:56:00.000Z	pecisk	SirYes	yes
2006-10-29T14:56:00.000Z	pecisk	SirYes	www.launchpad.net
