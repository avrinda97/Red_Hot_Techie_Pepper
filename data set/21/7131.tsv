2008-05-30T12:52:00.000Z	tony		hi i can't get my graphics to work on my laptop can anyone help
2008-05-30T12:53:00.000Z	dolphin	tony	 what graphics card do you have?
2008-05-30T12:53:00.000Z	tony	dolphin	geforce go5200
2008-05-30T12:53:00.000Z	dolphin	tony	 go to your terminal and type in sudo aptitude install nvidia-glx-new
2008-05-30T12:55:00.000Z	tony	dolphin	ok i'll try that one sec.
2008-05-30T12:56:00.000Z	dolphin	tony	 after that, you should just need to hit ctrl+alt+backspace and it should work.... if it doesn't work after that, you'll need to edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf to read "nvidia" where it says "nv"
2008-05-30T12:57:00.000Z	tony	dolphin	for some reason my terminal is sayin timestamp too far in the future
2008-05-30T12:58:00.000Z	dolphin	tony	 dunno what that means... is your clock configured to the right year?
2008-05-30T12:59:00.000Z	tony	dolphin	hmm i don't know i can't change it, i just recently enocunteered this. never had this before
2008-05-30T12:59:00.000Z	tony	dolphin	i'll restart and try again
2008-05-30T13:00:00.000Z	dolphin	tony	 can you still type in the terminal, regardless of the error message??
2008-05-30T13:00:00.000Z	tony	dolphin	yes
2008-05-30T13:00:00.000Z	tony	dolphin	just the sudo command doesn't work
2008-05-30T13:00:00.000Z	tony	dolphin	although it did work before
2008-05-30T13:00:00.000Z	dolphin	tony	 doubtful a restart will work, but you can try
2008-05-30T13:11:00.000Z	tony	dolphin	thanks alot it worked!
2008-05-30T13:12:00.000Z	tony	dolphin	stil one more question, how do i configure the resolution manulaly
2008-05-30T13:13:00.000Z	tony	dolphin	i'm using xubuntu, but in the display icon it doesn't allow me to add resolutions or change them
2008-05-30T13:13:00.000Z	dolphin	tony	 for that, you definitely need to sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-05-30T13:14:00.000Z	dolphin	tony	 you'll need to search for example xorg.conf files thru google... but you're looking for a section that says "modelines" & then lists a buncha resolutions... you'll wanna add all the resolutions your monitor can handle to that line
2008-05-30T13:15:00.000Z	tony	dolphin	ok thnx
