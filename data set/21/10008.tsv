2006-04-25T10:31:00.000Z	amphi	CarlFK	that's it, I think
2006-04-25T10:31:00.000Z	CarlFK	amphi	there is BadRam and BadMem - forlks or something.  I could never get them to work with 2.6
2006-04-25T10:31:00.000Z	amphi	CarlFK	I haven't needed to use them, but I read about them
2006-04-25T10:32:00.000Z	CarlFK	amphi	I had a 256 meg laptop stick that had a few bad bits... could never get it to work, freind looked at it and said "forget it"
2006-04-25T10:33:00.000Z	amphi	CarlFK	I had some marginal ram in my old t22, but the errors 'moved around', so I just underclocked it a bit
2006-04-25T10:34:00.000Z	amphi	CarlFK	I opened multi-megabyte html pages in ancient versions of mozilla
2006-04-25T10:35:00.000Z	CarlFK	amphi	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/12579  the last line I see is # 1927 Apr1918:39:57debconf:<--0multiselectbackupprogresscancel
2006-04-25T10:35:00.000Z	CarlFK	amphi	and then lots of 'emptyness'
2006-04-25T10:36:00.000Z	amphi	CarlFK	line numbers run out at 4941 here, but the file continues...
2006-04-25T10:37:00.000Z	amphi	CarlFK	last line I see is "5 logical  378.3 MB   F swap       swap   , , Undo changes to partitions, Finish partitioning and write changes to disk"
2006-04-25T10:37:00.000Z	CarlFK	amphi	the file was made with head -n 4940 syslog >syslog4940  so thats about right

2006-04-25T10:37:00.000Z	CarlFK	amphi	the file was 350k - guess threre is a bit of overhead
2006-05-22T09:19:00.000Z	amphi	CarlFK	did you build a kernel with make-kpkg and install it? that'll do it
2006-05-22T09:19:00.000Z	amphi	CarlFK	perhaps a kernel source package will
2006-05-22T09:19:00.000Z	CarlFK	amphi	k - I was hoping somenone knew which one - installed a bunch
