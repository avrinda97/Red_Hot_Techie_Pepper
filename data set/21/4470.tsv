2008-04-26T05:50:00.000Z	thinkingfrog	Pelo	 what does that do?
2008-04-26T05:50:00.000Z	Pelo	thinkingfrog	 recondfigure your video driver
2008-04-26T05:51:00.000Z	thinkingfrog	Pelo	 I just got the Nvidia drivers working with Envy
2008-04-26T05:51:00.000Z	thinkingfrog	Pelo	 why?
2008-04-26T05:51:00.000Z	Pelo	thinkingfrog	 there is your problem  do not install with envy
2008-04-26T05:54:00.000Z	thinkingfrog	Pelo	 no other installation method worked
2008-04-26T05:54:00.000Z	thinkingfrog	Pelo	 except using the nv driver :D
2008-04-26T05:55:00.000Z	Pelo	thinkingfrog	 you cna install the binariy driver manualy ,  you shoudlnbe be using envy , in anycase envy was made fro gutsy not for hardy
2008-04-26T06:31:00.000Z	Pelo	thinkingfrog	do you realy want all the desltp effects or can you be satisfied with some basic compositing ? shadows,  transparencies menu animation ?
2008-04-26T06:31:00.000Z	thinkingfrog	Pelo	 I want to make sure that composite works, because then that means that graphics works
2008-04-26T06:32:00.000Z	thinkingfrog	Pelo	 if composite graphics work, then driver works...at least, I think
2008-04-26T06:33:00.000Z	Pelo	thinkingfrog	you have two kind of compositing in 8.04 ,  compiz will all the bells and whistle and metacity with jsut basic stuff so you can have avant windows manager and screenlets working properly
2008-04-26T06:34:00.000Z	thinkingfrog	Pelo	 I'm using gutsy
2008-04-26T06:34:00.000Z	Pelo	thinkingfrog	 try asking in #compiz then, maybe they know better
2008-04-26T07:59:00.000Z	Pelo	thinkingfrog	yes
