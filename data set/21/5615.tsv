2008-05-30T16:51:00.000Z	manoff		i have some old device that connects to PS/2 port and some closed source win32 app to operate with it. can you tell me any software that can sniff the communication between this device and app?
2008-05-30T16:53:00.000Z	manoff		any ideas?
2008-05-30T16:54:00.000Z	manoff		try it
2008-05-30T16:54:00.000Z	sipior	manoff	you can try running the application in a virtual machine, and then using strace to intercept the relevant system calls. i suggest a hefty use of grep here ;-)
2008-05-30T16:54:00.000Z	manoff	sipior	aha
2008-05-30T16:55:00.000Z	manoff	sipior	virtualization is completely new to me
2008-05-30T16:55:00.000Z	sipior	manoff	the system calls will be translated by the VM, but if you're only trying to work out the communcation protocol, it should do
2008-05-30T16:55:00.000Z	manoff	sipior	is there really no other way, like "tcpdump" but with PS/2?
2008-05-30T16:55:00.000Z	manoff	sipior	ok
2008-05-30T16:56:00.000Z	sipior	manoff	well, all the writes are just system calls...
2008-05-30T16:56:00.000Z	manoff	sipior	i was looking for some command line tool such as "tcpdump" but which works with ps/2 instead, but i guess there is none :/
2008-05-30T16:57:00.000Z	sipior	manoff	strace | grep ;-)
2008-05-30T16:57:00.000Z	manoff	sipior	ok cool
2008-05-30T16:57:00.000Z	manoff	sipior	i will seek into it
2008-05-30T16:57:00.000Z	sipior	manoff	have fun
2008-05-30T17:16:00.000Z	manoff	sipior	are you still here?
2008-05-30T17:16:00.000Z	sipior	manoff	yes, i am
2008-05-30T17:16:00.000Z	manoff	sipior	the problem is that this app is windows stuff
2008-05-30T17:16:00.000Z	manoff	sipior	i cant run it on linux
2008-05-30T17:17:00.000Z	manoff	sipior	and its has GUI interface and i dont even have X installed
2008-05-30T17:17:00.000Z	sipior	manoff	well, you can try running it under wine. or have a go with any number of virtual machines under linux. you will need X installed for the gui though...
