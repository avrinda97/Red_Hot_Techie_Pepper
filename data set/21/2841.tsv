2010-02-18T08:24:00.000Z	semitones	Xgates	I'm not that familiar with grub t2, but I think I can find you a link..
2010-02-18T08:25:00.000Z	semitones	Xgates	if you have any questions I'll be happy to help
2010-02-18T08:26:00.000Z	semitones	Xgates	did you try the stuff in that link?
2010-02-18T08:27:00.000Z	Xgates	semitones	 I need to comment out ---> #GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0
2010-02-18T08:28:00.000Z	semitones	Xgates	to see the menu, just remove the "#" and specify how many seconds you want to see the menu
2010-02-18T08:28:00.000Z	Xgates	semitones	I got it already :) BUT I can't seem to get this menu entry to show up ---> http://pastebin.com/m721940c0
2010-02-18T08:30:00.000Z	semitones	Xgates	ok, could you post the whole file?
2010-02-18T08:34:00.000Z	Xgates	semitones	grub2 isn't the same
2010-02-18T08:34:00.000Z	semitones	Xgates	there isn't one config file that you edit?
2010-02-18T08:36:00.000Z	Xgates	semitones	uses a config called grub.cfg but you have to make changes elsewhere
2010-02-18T08:36:00.000Z	semitones	Xgates	ok, let me read up on it. :)
2010-02-18T08:40:00.000Z	Xgates	semitones	got it, need to add any entries into ---->  /etc/grub.d/40_custom
2010-02-18T08:41:00.000Z	semitones	Xgates	did you make the file executable?
2010-02-18T08:41:00.000Z	Xgates	semitones	you have to add any custom entries you want into /etc/grub.d/40_custom then after making entries in that file you run --->  update-grub  :)
2010-02-18T08:42:00.000Z	semitones	Xgates	cool, good luck. I'm reading the wiki, and it's pretty confusing
2010-02-18T08:42:00.000Z	semitones	Xgates	it looks like you're supposed to make a _file_ and put it in /etc/grub.d/
