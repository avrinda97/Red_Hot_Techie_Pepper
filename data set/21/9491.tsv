2007-05-15T12:48:00.000Z	Flannel	nj786	How did you install pidgin?
2007-05-15T12:49:00.000Z	Flannel	nj786	typed it in a terminal?  Pidgin isn't in any Ubuntu version.  So, you did somethign else to get it.
2007-06-17T11:40:00.000Z	Flannel	nj786	That's one of the docks.  I'd check out Avant Window Navigator (http://awn.wetpaint.com/?t=anon)
2007-06-17T11:42:00.000Z	Flannel	nj786	yeah
2007-06-17T11:43:00.000Z	Flannel	nj786	they have an ubuntu repository if you poke around that site some.
2007-06-17T11:50:00.000Z	Flannel	nj786	http://awn.wetpaint.com/page/Ubuntu+Feisty+Repository  follow those instructions
2007-06-17T11:52:00.000Z	Flannel	nj786	No.  The first command there has you open a text editor, then the second set is stuff you add to that text document.  Then the third set of instructions is again in the terminal
2007-06-17T11:58:00.000Z	Flannel	nj786	Once you've gotten thm installed, I'm not really sure.  Does it not pop up?  I'd try the forum post (at the bottom of that page), and read through it, see what people have questions with (and maybe post your own)
2007-06-17T12:00:00.000Z	Flannel	nj786	If you only want a panel, AWN is the way to go, from what I hear.  More stable than cairo.
2007-06-29T11:35:00.000Z	Flannel	nj786	are you dualbooting with windows?
2007-08-25T12:43:00.000Z	Flannel	nj786	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine
