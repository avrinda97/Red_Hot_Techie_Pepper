2008-01-13T21:54:00.000Z	NET||abuse	nickrud	indeed :P stupid me.. i download the odd podcast on the file server automatically, and was just going to download the file to my phone while i go to the chemist for my gf
2008-01-13T21:55:00.000Z	NET||abuse	nickrud	stupid usb stack hung up on my laptop,,
2008-01-13T21:56:00.000Z	nickrud	NET||abuse	that's happened a few times to me (much less now that udev is more mature) I didn't want to learn enough to fix it by hand, so I'd reboot
2008-01-13T21:56:00.000Z	NET||abuse	nickrud	damn,, just really would like to get around the problem without rebooting all the time..
2008-01-13T21:57:00.000Z	NET||abuse	nickrud	it's become a real hastle.
2008-01-13T21:57:00.000Z	nickrud	NET||abuse	have you looked on bugs.ubuntu.com for bugs relating to that and referencing your chipset?
2008-01-13T21:58:00.000Z	NET||abuse	nickrud	i should do so now... how do i determine my chipset?
2008-01-13T21:59:00.000Z	nickrud	NET||abuse	lspci , and you should see something about USB controller
2008-01-13T21:59:00.000Z	NET||abuse	nickrud	thanks, yeh i found that after i asked,, cool, i'll go search bugs
2008-01-13T22:10:00.000Z	nickrud	NET||abuse	the preliminary stuff to filing a bug is running tail -f /var/log/syslog in a terminal, then try inserting and removing usb devices. See if there are any messages. Include them in the bug report
2008-01-13T22:12:00.000Z	NET||abuse	nickrud	i've been watching /var/log/syslog and messages and there are no log events occuring at all when i do anything with the usb ports.
2008-01-13T22:12:00.000Z	nickrud	NET||abuse	heh.
2009-01-05T12:05:00.000Z	nickrud	NET||abuse	I'd create a new dir, say   /vm
2009-01-05T12:05:00.000Z	NET||abuse	nickrud	suppose..
2009-01-05T12:06:00.000Z	nickrud	NET||abuse	generally all the existing dirs have 'purposes' in the FHS, so you wouldn't put them there. Except maybey /usr/local/vm
2009-01-05T12:09:00.000Z	NET||abuse	nickrud	that's what i was thinking about.. i didn't want to go contaminating my main file system layout without considering it more carefully
2009-01-05T12:09:00.000Z	nickrud	NET||abuse	I always use personal ones under / somewhere. Completely out of the tree :)
2009-01-05T12:10:00.000Z	nickrud	NET||abuse	for data, that is. proggies in /usr/local
2009-01-05T12:10:00.000Z	NET||abuse	nickrud	ok,, by proggies in /usr/local you mean what? only stuff you need to run a specific app you put under /usr/local?
2009-01-05T12:11:00.000Z	nickrud	NET||abuse	anything I compile. Binaries I keep in $HOME, under ~/local
