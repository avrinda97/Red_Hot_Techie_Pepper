2005-04-14T14:29:00.000Z	linuxboy		Im going to upgrade from Warty to Hoary soon. Anything i can prepare for? Any tips?? I have some Backports installed...
2005-04-14T14:31:00.000Z	bob2`	linuxboy	get rid of all the backports
2005-04-14T14:31:00.000Z	bob2`	linuxboy	and remember not to use them ever again
2005-04-14T14:31:00.000Z	linuxboy	bob2`	really? will that break it?
2005-04-14T14:32:00.000Z	linuxboy	bob2`	but how do i get the latest software without them ?
2005-04-14T14:32:00.000Z	bob2`	linuxboy	you deal with not having software release five seconds ago, or you use the development version of ubuntu
2005-04-14T14:33:00.000Z	linuxboy	bob2`	what ?
2005-04-14T14:34:00.000Z	bob2`	linuxboy	which bit was confusing?
2005-04-14T14:34:00.000Z	linuxboy	bob2`	all of it
2005-04-14T14:34:00.000Z	linuxboy	bob2`	you deal with not having software release five seconds ago, ????

2005-04-14T14:35:00.000Z	bob2`	linuxboy	ubuntu comes out every six months
2005-04-14T14:35:00.000Z	bob2`	linuxboy	waiting a few months for newer stuff will not kill you
2005-04-14T14:36:00.000Z	linuxboy	bob2`	what if there are features I want to use?
2005-04-14T14:36:00.000Z	bob2`	linuxboy	then use the development version of ubuntu
2005-04-14T14:38:00.000Z	linuxboy	bob2`	ill use backports thank you very much
2005-04-14T14:38:00.000Z	bob2`	linuxboy	even if they make it impossible to upgrade to the next version of ubuntu?
2005-04-14T14:39:00.000Z	linuxboy	bob2`	nothing is impossible, apt can do magic... ill fix it myself
2005-04-14T14:41:00.000Z	linuxboy	bob2`	you didnt tell me how to fix it
2005-04-14T14:43:00.000Z	bob2`	linuxboy	?
2005-04-14T14:43:00.000Z	bob2`	linuxboy	seriously, you have to remove them before you can upgrade
