2008-11-18T17:31:00.000Z	lee_		Hi, I'm trying to compile ffmpeg with AAC + H.264 support, and make returns an error about "dsputil.c: In function ‘h263_v_loop_filter_c’", and starts with "dsputil.c:2685: error: ‘ENABLE_H263_ENCODER’ undeclared (first use in this function)"
2008-11-18T17:31:00.000Z	lee_		What is wrong?
2008-11-18T17:33:00.000Z	lee_		Damnit!
2008-11-18T17:34:00.000Z	lee_		why is it so hard to get a decent Mp4 conversion done in Linux
2008-11-18T17:36:00.000Z	m2k	lee_	what are you trying to convert to/from
2008-11-18T17:36:00.000Z	lee_	m2k	anything supported -> iPod/Quicktime compatible MP4
2008-11-18T17:37:00.000Z	m2k	lee_	use media encoder mediacoder.sourceforge.net
2008-11-18T17:37:00.000Z	lee_	m2k	ok i'll try that, thanks
2008-11-18T17:38:00.000Z	m2k	lee_	it is command line but you can search for good settings to use for ipod quicktime or mp4
2008-11-18T17:38:00.000Z	lee_	m2k	...linux with wine? this is a Windows application?
2008-11-18T17:39:00.000Z	m2k	lee_	err wrong url hang on
2008-11-18T17:39:00.000Z	lee_	m2k	ah ok, I've already tried Windows solutions under Wine and I just end up with audio which is out-of-sync
2008-11-18T17:46:00.000Z	m2k	lee_	meant to say mencoder: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MEncoder
2008-11-18T17:46:00.000Z	lee_	m2k	ok but I think I already have that
2008-11-18T17:47:00.000Z	m2k	lee_	it might be easier to use something like media-convert.com or mux.am
2008-11-18T17:47:00.000Z	lee_	m2k	are those web-based ones?
2008-11-18T17:48:00.000Z	lee_	m2k	bad idea, each file is ~200+MB, would be very bad :)
2008-11-18T17:48:00.000Z	m2k	lee_	yeah, if that doesnt work for you also there might be a gui for mencoder
2008-11-18T17:48:00.000Z	m2k	lee_	depends on your internet connection ;)
2008-11-18T17:48:00.000Z	lee_	m2k	dsl, 409kbit (about 39-40KByte) upspeed xD
2008-11-18T17:49:00.000Z	lee_	m2k	i tried podencoder but that needed ffmpeg/mencoder compiled with H264+AAC support, which is why I came here, because ffmpeg wouldnt compile, i'll try mencoder now though
