2011-01-20T07:09:00.000Z	amh345		does the latest edition of ubuntu server install with wireless adapters?
2011-01-20T07:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	amh345	depends on the chip
2011-01-20T07:11:00.000Z	amh345	ActionParsnip	past versions of ubuntu seemed to have installed with it. but this latest one looks like it hasnt.  i'm resintalling again, just to ensure i did it right.. but incase it doesnt install again, is there a bundle for wireless drivers i can apt-get?
2011-01-20T07:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	amh345	maybe: linux-backports-modules-wireless-lucid-generic or if you are installing server      linux-backports-modules-wireless-lucid-server
2011-01-20T07:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	amh345	obviously change the release name if necessary
2011-01-20T07:14:00.000Z	amh345	ActionParsnip	thank you
2011-02-21T06:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	amh345	gnome-mplayer
2011-02-21T06:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	amh345	all players can play all formats as there is a central repository of codecs in the OS
2011-02-21T06:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	amh345	if one can play a format, so can the others. I recommend you install both as they will pull in a lot of codecs
2011-02-21T06:41:00.000Z	amh345	ActionParsnip	i had some issues playing iso videos and .vobs
2011-02-21T06:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	amh345	also add the medibuntu repo and install w32codecs as well as ubuntu-restricted-extras
2011-02-21T06:42:00.000Z	amh345	ActionParsnip	thanks. will do!
2011-02-21T06:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	amh345	vlc and mplayer can play them as file, just use the file menu
2011-02-26T22:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	amh345	how do you mean?
2011-02-26T22:51:00.000Z	amh345	ActionParsnip	from terminal, i have a program ffmpeg. but it's an older machine (has versionitis) and i cant see which version of mmpeg is loading from command.
2011-02-26T22:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	amh345	you can see what binary is ran when you run a command using: which <commandhere>        e.g.    which nano
2011-02-26T22:52:00.000Z	amh345	ActionParsnip	that did it. thanks
2011-03-24T09:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	amh345	you can write a script (ftp can be scripted too)
2011-03-24T09:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	amh345	or mount the ftp then rsync as ac7ss says
2011-03-24T09:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	amh345	have the ftp permanently mounted at boot using fstab
2012-05-24T04:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	amh345	looks good to me
