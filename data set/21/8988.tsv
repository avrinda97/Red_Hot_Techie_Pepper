2005-12-02T14:36:00.000Z	adonikam	infamus	add ",uid=1000" to the options part of the winxp line in /etc/fstab
2005-12-02T14:42:00.000Z	adonikam	infamus	open a terminal and type "sudo gedit /etc/fstab" without the quotes
2005-12-02T14:43:00.000Z	adonikam	infamus	you could also copy the contents to http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl to show us
2005-12-02T14:46:00.000Z	infamus	adonikam	i added my uid=1000 to the hdal and adbl lines, but there was no winxp line to add it to and i still get a "cant access" error
2005-12-02T14:47:00.000Z	adonikam	infamus	remove what you did - you need to know what "device" file windows xp can be accessed from
2005-12-02T14:49:00.000Z	infamus	adonikam	im in over my head....i have no clue what any of that means other than "remove what you did
2005-12-02T14:52:00.000Z	adonikam	infamus	try System>Administration>Disks and look for the partition that you mounted but couldn't access. It should be called /dev/something. find the line that begins with this and add ",uid=1000" there. Then in gedit do Edit>Copy and open http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl in your browser. Click the big white box and do Edit>Paste and then click send
2005-12-02T14:53:00.000Z	infamus	adonikam	ok, can do
2005-12-02T14:56:00.000Z	infamus	adonikam	ok, i may not need to worry about anything, i can access the contents of the NTFS partitions through the System>Administration>disks menu
2005-12-02T14:57:00.000Z	adonikam	infamus	this is because the program has root permissions. you should not always go there *just* so you can do this.
2005-12-02T15:05:00.000Z	infamus	adonikam	here is the pasted fstab you wanted http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/5141
2005-12-02T15:07:00.000Z	adonikam	infamus	looks good! now run "sudo umount /media/hda1 && sudo umount /media/hda1 && sudo mount /media/hda1 && sudo mount /media/hdb1"
2005-12-02T15:08:00.000Z	adonikam	infamus	looks good! now run "sudo umount /media/hda1 && sudo umount /media/hdb1 && sudo mount /media/hda1 && sudo mount /media/hdb1"
2005-12-02T15:10:00.000Z	infamus	adonikam	now all I need is a good proggie to listen to all my mp3s
2005-12-02T15:10:00.000Z	adonikam	infamus	it's a pleasure
2005-12-02T15:10:00.000Z	adonikam	infamus	that's a matter of preference - mine is totem
2005-12-02T15:21:00.000Z	infamus	adonikam	ive downloaded totem 1.2.0, now how do i install it
2005-12-02T15:25:00.000Z	adonikam	infamus	what file have you downloaded? you should be able to install it from synaptic
2005-12-02T15:26:00.000Z	adonikam	infamus	check Applications>Sound & Video
2005-12-02T15:29:00.000Z	infamus	adonikam	i tried both totem and xmms and found that proper codecs dont even exist for the type of music files i use, blu-ray mp3s, but xmms did
2005-12-02T15:32:00.000Z	adonikam	infamus	blu-ray mp3s sounds very uncommon. But if xmms works for you then that's ok. It doesn't do video too, which is my problem with it
