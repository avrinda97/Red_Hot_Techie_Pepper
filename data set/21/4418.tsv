2008-11-18T00:45:00.000Z	VanessaE		Not getting the answers I need on #kubuntu...
2008-11-18T00:46:00.000Z	VanessaE		I've just reinstalled Hardy (after a hard disk error) and am trying to set up a printer that I've been using with hardy in the past.  The system can see it just fine, and it sets itself up automatically.
2008-11-18T00:46:00.000Z	VanessaE		but I can't print to it, at all.  Nothing I try works.
2008-11-18T00:47:00.000Z	VanessaE		the closest thing I can find is this error reported by the CUPS web interface:  "Unable to open device "hal:///org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/usb_device_4b8_805_H60150312180229220_if1_printer_noserial": Permission denied"
2008-11-18T00:48:00.000Z	VanessaE		how do I fix this?
2008-11-18T00:48:00.000Z	VanessaE		I can't even print as root
2008-11-18T00:49:00.000Z	VanessaE		OK..enough of this.
2008-11-18T00:49:00.000Z	VanessaE		how do I restore the cups configuration back to the PRECISE STATE it was in when I installed?
2008-11-18T00:50:00.000Z	VanessaE		(I was able to print exactly ONE test page initiallty, then nothing at all)
2008-11-18T00:50:00.000Z	fde	VanessaE	if you didn't back it up... you can't without grabbing it from another default install... what is the issue though?
2008-11-18T00:50:00.000Z	VanessaE	fde	see above.
2008-11-18T00:51:00.000Z	fde	VanessaE	What tool are you using to configure your printer? and what type of printer is it?
2008-11-18T00:51:00.000Z	VanessaE	fde	I have tried KDE's printer config program within kcontrol, as well as the CUPS web interface.
2008-11-18T00:52:00.000Z	fde	VanessaE	I find the CUPS web interface very easy... there is also a system-config-printer-kde though... try that if your Kubuntu is recent enough
2008-11-18T00:52:00.000Z	VanessaE	fde	I have tried KDE's printer config program within kcontrol  <-- system-config-printer-kde
2008-11-18T00:53:00.000Z	fde	VanessaE	no... within kcontrol it'd be kprinter
2008-11-18T00:54:00.000Z	fde	VanessaE	its not listed though: http://www.openprinting.org/printer_list.cgi?make=Epson  so it might be an impossible task
2008-11-18T00:54:00.000Z	VanessaE	fde	I've had this printer working fine before.
2008-11-18T00:55:00.000Z	fde	VanessaE	nm http://www.openprinting.org/show_printer.cgi?recnum=Epson-Stylus_CX6400
2008-11-18T00:55:00.000Z	fde	VanessaE	if its connected to the box, it should work out of the box... if you're using KDE3 though, I don't like your chances, there is a good reason they dropped kprinter
2008-11-18T00:55:00.000Z	fde	VanessaE	also, might wasnt to ask in #kubuntu anyways
