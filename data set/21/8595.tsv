2006-04-08T05:37:00.000Z	xstation	tonyyarusso	thanks for help some hours ago with partition
2006-04-08T05:38:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	xstation	You all set now?
2006-04-08T05:40:00.000Z	xstation	tonyyarusso	I am not in the live cd but no i am waiting for roryy but I think I have only been here a short time and i get the impression that I am a little dumb and people here will not tollerate it for long
2006-04-08T05:41:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	xstation	Oh, don't worry.  Most people tolerate new users pretty well.  We might not always be able to help you, but we'll try :)
2006-04-08T05:46:00.000Z	xstation	tonyyarusso	I was wondering if I might ask something about eth0 i am installing network bridge and it says  Please substitute eth0 for the name of your LAN interface.
2006-04-08T05:47:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	xstation	eth0 is the network interface, the card.
2006-04-08T05:47:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	xstation	You can probably figure out what it is from ifconfig.
2006-04-08T05:58:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	xstation	Okay, so what's the question with those.
2006-04-08T05:59:00.000Z	xstation	tonyyarusso	 i am installing network bridge and it says  Please substitute eth0 for the name of your LAN interface.what is the name of my LAN interface please
2006-04-08T06:00:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	xstation	eth0 in this case.  (They say that b/c it isn't necessarily.)
2006-04-08T06:02:00.000Z	xstation	tonyyarusso	thanks so its etho no name what do you mean by hey say that b/c it isn't necessarily?
2006-04-08T06:03:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	xstation	eth0, as in eth-zero.  It could be eth1, wlan0, or some other thing, depending on your system, so they give the example and tell you to modify it if necessary.
2006-04-08T06:06:00.000Z	xstation	tonyyarusso	thanks what about the line where it says Give the LAN interface a neutral IP
2006-04-08T06:06:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	xstation	I'd try 192.168.1.1 myself.
2006-04-08T06:08:00.000Z	xstation	tonyyarusso	ok thanks and not 192.168.1.64
2006-04-08T06:10:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	xstation	That could work too.
2006-04-08T06:16:00.000Z	xstation	tonyyarusso	so just to recap I actually but the word "eth0" in as the name and 0.0.0.0.0. would be the ip address of my router
2006-04-08T06:17:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	xstation	You're router IP is probably something else.
2006-04-08T06:17:00.000Z	xstation	tonyyarusso	sorry would be192.168.1.64
2006-04-08T06:17:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	xstation	Some other people can probably help you with that, I need to eat.  Could be that; don't know.
