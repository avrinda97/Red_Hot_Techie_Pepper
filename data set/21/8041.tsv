2006-06-07T07:45:00.000Z	KuLover		Package libifp4 is not available, but is referred to by another package.
2006-06-07T07:45:00.000Z	KuLover		This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
2006-06-07T07:45:00.000Z	KuLover		is only available from another source
2006-06-07T07:45:00.000Z	KuLover		E: Package libifp4 has no installation candidate
2006-06-07T07:46:00.000Z	nickrud	KuLover	first, please don't paste :) and it's in the universe repo, which you need to enable. See !components for why, and !repos for how, below
2006-06-07T10:02:00.000Z	nickrud	KuLover	I did that once or twice. What are we talking about?
2006-06-07T10:03:00.000Z	KuLover	nickrud	and krazykit, when trying to open firefox in the terminal, it asks for libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0. Do you know which package I need to install for this?
2006-06-07T10:05:00.000Z	nickrud	KuLover	libgtk2.0-0 contains that file
2006-06-07T10:05:00.000Z	KuLover	nickrud	I have that installed, might it be different for 64bit users? I thought it was that one to, it worksed on my 32bit setup.
2006-06-07T10:06:00.000Z	nickrud	KuLover	but you probably need the dev file during compilation: libgtk2.0-dev
2006-06-07T10:06:00.000Z	nickrud	KuLover	oh, 64bit.
2006-06-07T10:07:00.000Z	nickrud	KuLover	I haven't compiled anything in 64 bit
2006-06-07T10:07:00.000Z	KuLover	nickrud	I think firefox is already compiled, it just needs the dev files to open.
2006-06-15T07:43:00.000Z	nickrud	KuLover	I have my music set up jst that way
2006-06-15T07:44:00.000Z	KuLover	nickrud	How do you have it formated? on an extended parition or primary?
2006-06-15T07:44:00.000Z	nickrud	KuLover	that's irrelevant
2006-06-15T07:45:00.000Z	KuLover	nickrud	Okay thanks.. wasn't sure if it mattered.
2006-06-15T07:45:00.000Z	nickrud	KuLover	very true, it never hurts to ask
2006-06-15T08:45:00.000Z	nickrud	KuLover	rm (remove)
