2006-09-03T12:18:00.000Z	Lathiat	Gary4ga1	cool :)
2006-09-03T12:21:00.000Z	Lathiat	Gary4ga1	hrm its possible hd0 isnt right
2006-09-03T12:22:00.000Z	Lathiat	Gary4ga1	put both the things i said
2006-09-03T12:23:00.000Z	Lathiat	Gary4ga1	have you mounted your filesystemm?
2006-09-03T12:24:00.000Z	Lathiat	Gary4ga1	well what you could do for me
2006-09-03T12:24:00.000Z	Lathiat	Gary4ga1	if you can mount your filesystem (do you know how to do that?)
2006-09-03T12:24:00.000Z	Lathiat	Gary4ga1	and then check what is iin /boot/grub/menu.lst?
2006-09-03T12:24:00.000Z	Lathiat	Gary4ga1	if your not sure how to do that let me know
2006-09-03T12:27:00.000Z	Lathiat	Gary4ga1	im afraid i must go but once you get that line
2006-09-03T12:27:00.000Z	Lathiat	Gary4ga1	that says groot=(hd0,0) you want to run root(hd0,0) (or hd1,1 or whatever is inside that)
2006-09-03T12:27:00.000Z	Lathiat	Gary4ga1	then after than setup(hd0) or whatever the 'hd0' is in the groot line
2006-09-03T12:27:00.000Z	Lathiat	Gary4ga1	may be hd1, hd2 or whatever
2006-09-03T12:46:00.000Z	Lathiat	Gary4ga1	ok so you probably want
2006-09-03T12:46:00.000Z	Lathiat	Gary4ga1	root(hd0,7)
2006-09-03T12:46:00.000Z	Lathiat	Gary4ga1	setup(hd0)
2006-09-03T12:47:00.000Z	Lathiat	Gary4ga1	rather, minto the grub shell
