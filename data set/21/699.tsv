2011-07-25T08:26:00.000Z	DeJavou42	dr_willis	startx results in no screens found. tried with ati card and onboard intel card. any thoughts
2011-07-25T08:27:00.000Z	dr_willis	DeJavou42	 its not one of those new dual-gpu laptops?
2011-07-25T08:29:00.000Z	DeJavou42	dr_willis	it was working and then I added xorg-edgers ppa. and upgraded xserver from their source. then booting resulted in blank screen (no signal) after bootsplash
2011-07-25T08:30:00.000Z	dr_willis	DeJavou42	 shall i ask why you did that if it was working?  ;)
2011-07-25T08:30:00.000Z	DeJavou42	dr_willis	removed xorg-edgers ppa, and got everything back to default. but its booting into tty1, and tty7 isn't running x.
2011-07-25T08:31:00.000Z	DeJavou42	dr_willis	upgraded graphics card from nvidia to ati. found a post that said xorg-edgers ati module was better than flgrx
2011-07-25T08:31:00.000Z	DeJavou42	dr_willis	yep, ppa-purge
2011-07-25T08:34:00.000Z	DeJavou42	dr_willis	wasn't an upgrade as much as I had the ati card laying around, and it would do what i needed it to
2011-07-25T08:34:00.000Z	dr_willis	DeJavou42	 you could check the 'dkms' status command and purge and drivers from all kernels. and try reinstalling them
2011-07-25T08:35:00.000Z	DeJavou42	dr_willis	it pulled up nvidia and virtualbox-ose
2011-07-25T08:36:00.000Z	dr_willis	DeJavou42	 thats a start. id remove those ;)
2011-07-25T08:37:00.000Z	DeJavou42	dr_willis	you mentioned purging the drivers from all kernels and reinstalling them.. what commands would do that?
2011-07-25T08:39:00.000Z	DeJavou42	dr_willis	gotcha, sorry wasn't thinking of drivers as packages..
2011-07-25T08:46:00.000Z	DeJavou42	dr_willis	I got it. Xorg.conf didn't exist in /etc/x11 so I copied a xorg.conf.backup to xorg.conf and Bingo! startx works again.
2011-07-25T08:47:00.000Z	DeJavou42	dr_willis	but now, the box still boots to tty1, and x still isn't automatically starting on tty7
2011-07-25T08:51:00.000Z	dr_willis	DeJavou42	 the gdm service starts?
2011-07-25T08:58:00.000Z	DeJavou42	dr_willis	yup gdm starts
2011-07-25T08:59:00.000Z	DeJavou42	dr_willis	but i don't get the login screen. Instead I have to log in from tty1 and then startx opens my gnome desktop (because I'm already logged in)
2011-07-25T09:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	DeJavou42	 be sure gdm is set to start at boot time
2011-07-25T09:02:00.000Z	dr_willis	DeJavou42	 should be a /etc/init/gdm.conf
2011-07-25T09:03:00.000Z	DeJavou42	dr_willis	thanks for the help!
