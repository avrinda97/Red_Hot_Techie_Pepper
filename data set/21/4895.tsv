2008-04-21T03:45:00.000Z	Achoth_		Hello. Is there anyone here who are using an ITX board with Ubuntu? If so, how well do Compiz Fusion work with it?
2008-04-21T03:45:00.000Z	ikonia	Achoth_	an itx board has no relevance on compiz-fusion
2008-04-21T03:46:00.000Z	ikonia	Achoth_	your video card has the effect you're worried about
2008-04-21T03:47:00.000Z	Achoth_	ikonia	Well, the ITX boards has integrated videocards and processors that cannot be changed, so I'm actually asking about the entire system.
2008-04-21T03:47:00.000Z	ikonia	Achoth_	itx boards could have any variation of video card, disk controllers, chipsets, all that can effect cmopiz
2008-04-21T03:47:00.000Z	ikonia	Achoth_	there are 100's of combinations some will work better than others
2008-04-21T03:49:00.000Z	Achoth_	ikonia	Of course, but there are only 2 (I think) graphic circuits available, so they all should be rather similar.
2008-04-21T03:49:00.000Z	ikonia	Achoth_	no, there are multiple
2008-04-21T03:49:00.000Z	ikonia	Achoth_	multiple brands, and multiple versions of the chips
2008-04-21T03:49:00.000Z	Achoth_	ikonia	It sounds like you have an ITX board?
2008-04-21T03:49:00.000Z	ikonia	Achoth_	I have a few yes
2008-04-21T03:50:00.000Z	Achoth_	ikonia	How awesome. Have you tried Compiz on them?
2008-04-21T03:50:00.000Z	ikonia	Achoth_	it runs by default on anything more than ubutnu 7.10 so yes
2008-04-21T03:51:00.000Z	Achoth_	ikonia	Yes, but does it run flawlessly even with the cube and such?
2008-04-21T03:51:00.000Z	ikonia	Achoth_	depends on which machine I'm on with which cards and configs I have, some work better than others
2008-04-21T03:52:00.000Z	Achoth_	ikonia	Do you have a Epia-NX12000EG with 1 GB RAM?
2008-04-21T03:52:00.000Z	ikonia	Achoth_	no
2008-04-21T03:54:00.000Z	Achoth_	ikonia	Alright, although I realize some of the cards will work better with Compiz than others, but with your cards, how well do it work?
2008-04-21T03:54:00.000Z	ikonia	Achoth_	fine
2008-04-21T03:55:00.000Z	Achoth_	ikonia	Thanks alot :)
