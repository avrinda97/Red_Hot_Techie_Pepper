2007-08-26T08:54:00.000Z	drrngrvy	clever	at least it's not just me.
2007-08-26T08:54:00.000Z	clever	drrngrvy	my wifi crashes randomly and recovers after 1-4 seconds
2007-08-26T08:54:00.000Z	clever	drrngrvy	and the wifi driver module was blacklisted(caused solid lockups on other systems)
2007-08-26T08:54:00.000Z	drrngrvy	clever	I'm on a wired connection and that's just the same.
2007-08-26T08:54:00.000Z	clever	drrngrvy	my laptop is on wired atm
2007-08-26T08:55:00.000Z	clever	drrngrvy	i stole its wifi card for use in other things
2007-08-26T08:55:00.000Z	drrngrvy	clever	how's that?

2007-08-26T08:56:00.000Z	drrngrvy	clever	the funny thing is before the upgrade I was struggling with my windows net connection but K/Ubuntu was super-stable; now it's the other way around

2007-08-26T08:56:00.000Z	drrngrvy		I'm just shocked it hasn't been sorted yet

2007-08-26T08:56:00.000Z	drrngrvy		what is an OS without stable net access?
2007-08-26T08:57:00.000Z	clever	drrngrvy	my wifi driver also has a bug where it drops the last char of the essid
