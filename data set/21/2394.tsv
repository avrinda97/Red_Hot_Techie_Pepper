2011-12-24T11:31:00.000Z	pp7		is there a way to get animated progressbars in gtk-3?
2011-12-24T11:32:00.000Z	almoxarife	pp7	wouldn't that depend on the app?
2011-12-24T11:33:00.000Z	pp7	almoxarife	i mean like how would i go about getting animated progressbars?
2011-12-24T11:33:00.000Z	almoxarife	pp7	wouldn't that depend on the app?
2011-12-24T11:34:00.000Z	pp7	almoxarife	no it wouldn't
2011-12-24T11:35:00.000Z	almoxarife	pp7	synaptic has a progress bar, it is also gtk3(aint it?) and its animated, like that?
2011-12-24T11:35:00.000Z	pp7	almoxarife	yes but its not animated for me (in my theme which is elementary)
2011-12-27T12:54:00.000Z	almoxarife	pp7	look for the extension for compression for nautilus,
2011-12-27T12:54:00.000Z	pp7	almoxarife	what about marlin?
2011-12-27T12:54:00.000Z	almoxarife	pp7	no idea
2011-12-27T12:55:00.000Z	almoxarife	pp7	its in repos
2011-12-27T12:55:00.000Z	pp7	almoxarife	what is? Marlin?  I already have Marlin installed and i have the same problem with it
2011-12-27T12:56:00.000Z	almoxarife	pp7	I don't use or know 'marlin'
2011-12-27T13:04:00.000Z	pp7	almoxarife	sweet, i just built the latest version from source and its working :)
2011-12-27T13:04:00.000Z	almoxarife	pp7	built?
2011-12-27T13:05:00.000Z	pp7	almoxarife	yep from here: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/file-roller/3.2.1-0ubuntu1
2011-12-27T13:05:00.000Z	pp7	almoxarife	downloaded source and compiled it
2011-12-27T13:06:00.000Z	almoxarife	pp7	you needed something for compressing then, not a extension for nautilus for compression, got it
2011-12-27T13:06:00.000Z	pp7	almoxarife	no, the dialog when u select "compress" from the context menu was not working
2011-12-27T13:07:00.000Z	pp7	almoxarife	installing the latest version of file-roller fixed it
2011-12-27T13:07:00.000Z	almoxarife	pp7	cool
