2010-03-05T04:54:00.000Z	dsnyders		HI all!  I'm planning on making a new computer, heavy on virtualization capability.  Any recommendations for a good linux compatible motherboard
2010-03-05T04:54:00.000Z	blakkheim	dsnyders	X58 or P55 chipset
2010-03-05T04:54:00.000Z	dsnyders	blakkheim	Was that a question or a statement?
2010-03-05T04:55:00.000Z	blakkheim	dsnyders	a recommendation
2010-03-05T04:56:00.000Z	dsnyders	blakkheim	Okay, I'll keep that in mind.
2010-03-05T04:57:00.000Z	blakkheim	dsnyders	what type of cpu will you be using
2010-03-05T04:57:00.000Z	dsnyders	blakkheim	I was thinking of maybe a quad core?
2010-03-05T04:58:00.000Z	blakkheim	dsnyders	yes of course but which family of cpus? you'll need socket 1366 for an X58 board or socket 1156 for a P55
2010-03-05T05:00:00.000Z	dsnyders	blakkheim	When I last built a machine, the cpu choices were either Pentium 3, or AMD.  Today there is such a bewildering array of choices for CPUs and motherboards, that I don't really have a clue where to start.
2010-03-05T05:01:00.000Z	blakkheim	dsnyders	oh wow, then you might want to do a bit of reading in order to make sure everything works together (or just ask me and i'll tell you)
2010-03-05T05:02:00.000Z	dsnyders	blakkheim	I have a historical leaning towards Intel, but I've heard AMD is better and cheaper.
2010-03-05T05:02:00.000Z	blakkheim	dsnyders	i'm an intel guy
2010-03-05T05:02:00.000Z	dsnyders	blakkheim	I've heard Asus makes good linux compatible motherboards, but that they've been slipping lately.
2010-03-05T05:03:00.000Z	blakkheim	dsnyders	i like asus motherboards, haven't had any trouble with linux on them. it's really just the chipset that you need to check if it's compatible with linux (sound, NIC, etc)
2010-03-05T05:16:00.000Z	dsnyders	blakkheim	So... do you recommend picking a chipset, then finding a motherboard that uses that chipset and then seeing which cpus it can take, or starting with the CPU and then motherboard?
2010-03-05T05:17:00.000Z	blakkheim	dsnyders	if you want to do heavy stuff like running multiple virtual machines, i would get either a core i5 or core i7 cpu with a P55 motherboard
2010-03-05T05:17:00.000Z	blakkheim	dsnyders	it depends on how much power you need and how much cash you got
2010-03-05T05:18:00.000Z	dsnyders	blakkheim	I'm planning on setting up some virtual networks and machines for CCNA and MCSE study purposes.
2010-03-05T05:19:00.000Z	blakkheim	dsnyders	then yeah, i5 or i7 depending on your money
2010-03-05T05:20:00.000Z	dsnyders	blakkheim	okay.
2010-03-05T05:24:00.000Z	dsnyders	blakkheim	money won't likely be an issue.  However, the more expensive, the longer it will take before I scrape the funds together.
