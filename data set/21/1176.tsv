2011-01-08T08:03:00.000Z	NeedsNetworkHelp		No i'm not able to ping other sites, but traceroute works. I can access via the browser too.
2011-01-08T08:04:00.000Z	yeats	NeedsNetworkHelp	so you can reach Google in your browser but can't ping it?

2011-01-08T08:05:00.000Z	NeedsNetworkHelp		Yes i can ping localhost
2011-01-08T08:07:00.000Z	yeats	NeedsNetworkHelp	sounds like a firewall thing
2011-01-08T08:07:00.000Z	NeedsNetworkHelp	yeats	how do i check the firewall setting on ubuntu server 10.10?
2011-01-08T08:09:00.000Z	yeats	NeedsNetworkHelp	you can start with 'sudo ufw status'
2011-01-08T08:10:00.000Z	NeedsNetworkHelp	yeats	Status: inactive
2011-01-08T08:11:00.000Z	yeats	NeedsNetworkHelp	does 'host' work? (e.g. 'host google.com')
2011-01-08T08:12:00.000Z	NeedsNetworkHelp	yeats	Yes it does, google.com has address 66.102.11.104
2011-01-08T08:12:00.000Z	yeats	NeedsNetworkHelp	so is ping the only thing not working then?
2011-01-08T08:13:00.000Z	NeedsNetworkHelp	yeats	yes, ping isn't working. I am having trouble with connecting to my ubuntu server's vnc from windows and am unable to mount my shared samba mounts. I'm trying to troubleshoot it- i realised i can ping my server from my windows machine but i'm not able to ping my windows machine from my ubuntu server
2011-01-08T08:15:00.000Z	NeedsNetworkHelp	yeats	samba was working yesterday and I could map the drives from my windows machine. However now it's not working from my windows machine and as part of the  troubleshooting guide goes on: http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/Samba-HOWTO-Collection/diagnosis.html it says to test pinging the client machine
2011-01-08T08:16:00.000Z	NeedsNetworkHelp	yeats	so i'm unable to ping and it says my TCP/IP software is not correctly installed... so i'm trying to fix it now but have no idea.
2011-01-08T08:17:00.000Z	yeats	NeedsNetworkHelp	this isn't a solution, but you're not alone: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1648485
2011-01-08T08:21:00.000Z	NeedsNetworkHelp	yeats	i see. I just realised that I can ping my ubuntu server from my windows machine but I'm unable to ping it via my mac
2011-01-08T08:22:00.000Z	NeedsNetworkHelp	yeats	I also realised it doens't connect from my mac machine on the IP address via vnc, it connects via the machine.domain name which is OLYMPIA.LOCAL instead of 192.168.1.77
