2005-11-30T10:19:00.000Z	brenner	siriuskr	that's weird, the vesa driver is generally regarded as a failsafe
2005-11-30T10:19:00.000Z	brenner	siriuskr	no, it should be in the grub menu

2006-03-01T09:40:00.000Z	siriuskr	brenner	the www.divx.com codec
2006-03-01T09:41:00.000Z	brenner	siriuskr	wrong way to go about it:
2006-03-01T09:48:00.000Z	siriuskr	brenner	I did the sudo dpkg -i w32codecs_20050412-0.0_i386.deb and it set it up but totem still tells me no decoders to handle this file bla bla.
