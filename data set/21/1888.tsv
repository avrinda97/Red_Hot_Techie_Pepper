2010-07-31T00:25:00.000Z	bastidrazor	radar3d	try creating a new user and login as that user.
2010-07-31T00:40:00.000Z	bastidrazor	radar3d	there is a way to reset your settings for gnome for your other user. this will probably fix the issues with that user.
2010-07-31T00:41:00.000Z	radar3d	bastidrazor	I went in and made my user an administrator and it seems to be working
2010-07-31T00:41:00.000Z	bastidrazor	radar3d	the login issues are gone when you did that? and what exactly do you mean by made your user an administrator?
2010-07-31T00:42:00.000Z	bastidrazor	radar3d	do you mean in User and Groups you changed your account type?
2010-07-31T00:42:00.000Z	radar3d	bastidrazor	I was in x as root and went into the user manager and selected my username and made it administrator, it said I was "custom"
2010-07-31T00:43:00.000Z	radar3d	bastidrazor	yes
2010-07-31T00:44:00.000Z	bastidrazor	radar3d	i'm unsure to what that changed but if it is working then all is well.
2010-07-31T00:45:00.000Z	bastidrazor	radar3d	so does mine.
2010-07-31T00:45:00.000Z	radar3d	bastidrazor	well as long as it works I'll stick with it
2010-07-31T00:46:00.000Z	bastidrazor	radar3d	exactly.
