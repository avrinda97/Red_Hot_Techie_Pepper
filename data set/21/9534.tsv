2005-11-23T13:34:00.000Z	dducko	marcus	sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
2005-11-23T13:42:00.000Z	dducko	marcus	your other repos are commented out
2005-11-23T13:46:00.000Z	dducko	marcus	do you want the restricted repos?
2005-11-23T13:49:00.000Z	dducko	marcus	http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/4719
2005-11-23T13:49:00.000Z	dducko	marcus	first backup your source.list `sudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.bak`
2005-11-23T13:50:00.000Z	dducko	marcus	then change your source.list to http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/4719
2005-11-23T13:54:00.000Z	dducko	marcus	I only need to read the address part, so the language wont matter,
2005-11-23T13:54:00.000Z	dducko	marcus	i just went with what you had there.
2005-11-23T13:55:00.000Z	dducko	marcus	ubotu juat gave you some links, you can also use those sources if you want
2005-11-23T13:57:00.000Z	dducko	marcus	i would try the sources here, http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/969
2005-11-23T14:10:00.000Z	dducko	marcus	did you get it fixed?
