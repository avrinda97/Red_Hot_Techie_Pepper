2012-01-07T12:49:00.000Z	robde		hello, how can I check if the swap partition is working?
2012-01-07T12:49:00.000Z	Mr_Queue	robde	working?
2012-01-07T12:49:00.000Z	robde	Mr_Queue	free returns this: Swap:            0          0          0
2012-01-07T12:50:00.000Z	Mr_Queue	robde	grab some kernel source code and run... 'make -j 256'
2012-01-07T12:51:00.000Z	robde	Mr_Queue	is this also possible without recompiling the kernel?
2012-01-07T12:51:00.000Z	Mr_Queue	robde	You're not 'recompiling' a kernel you're just compiling one...
2012-01-07T12:51:00.000Z	Mr_Queue	robde	It will never finish.
2012-01-07T12:52:00.000Z	Mr_Queue	robde	So... Open a pair of shells, run it and watch it swap out and die.
2012-01-07T12:54:00.000Z	Mr_Queue	robde	Why do you need the swap anyways?
2012-01-07T12:55:00.000Z	robde	Mr_Queue	it's a very small vserver and it runs out of memory really fast. so a fried suggested to do something about the swap. I'm very new to this.
2012-01-07T12:55:00.000Z	robde	Mr_Queue	128m RAM
2012-01-07T12:55:00.000Z	Mr_Queue	robde	If you're running out of memory having swap isn't going to save the server.
2012-01-07T12:56:00.000Z	Mr_Queue	robde	You need more ram that's it... Or figure out what's eating it and fix that..
2012-01-07T12:57:00.000Z	Mr_Queue	robde	swap won't fix it.. It will hit swap, contact switches will stack up, the loads will hit 500 and you'll lose it to a reboot.
2012-01-07T13:01:00.000Z	robde	Mr_Queue	but isn't swap exactly for a case like this where the system doesn't provide much RAM?
2012-01-07T13:02:00.000Z	Mr_Queue	robde	nope
2012-01-07T13:02:00.000Z	Mr_Queue	robde	It's supposed to save it from a quick brush from death..
2012-01-07T13:07:00.000Z	Mr_Queue	robde	Ram is like a F-18 traveling at the speed of sound... disk (swap) is like a slug with a fast food problem. No joke. Add more ram.
2012-01-07T13:09:00.000Z	robde	Mr_Queue	I don't care if its slow. but it shouldn't stop installing processes etc. because of insufficient memory
2012-01-07T13:09:00.000Z	Mr_Queue	robde	You're on a VPS and hitting the bean counters then...
2012-01-07T13:11:00.000Z	Mr_Queue	robde	Don't really even need to pastebin it.. Look at the fail count. anything with *mem* in it and you'll know why..
