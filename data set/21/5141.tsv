2008-01-13T00:33:00.000Z	LamerMan		hi everyone! how can i make ubuntu save memory dumps after program crash?
2008-01-13T00:34:00.000Z	LamerMan		core dumps
2008-01-13T00:34:00.000Z	LamerMan		:)
2008-01-13T00:35:00.000Z	LamerMan		memory dumps of programs that crash
2008-01-13T00:35:00.000Z	soundray	LamerMan	special configuration shouldn't be necessary. Have you looked for core.* files in your $HOME?
2008-01-13T00:35:00.000Z	LamerMan	soundray	are these files hidden? I can't find any of them
2008-01-13T00:36:00.000Z	soundray	LamerMan	no.
2008-01-13T00:36:00.000Z	soundray	LamerMan	maybe the working directory of your crashed program is something other than your home dir.
2008-01-13T00:37:00.000Z	LamerMan	soundray	i can't find anything neither in my home directory nor in the program directory :(
2008-01-13T00:38:00.000Z	soundray	LamerMan	hmm. Are you sure your program terminated abnormally?
2008-01-13T00:38:00.000Z	LamerMan	soundray	may be its becouse i use Kubuntu? is there a big difference besides KDE?
2008-01-13T00:38:00.000Z	soundray	LamerMan	not really
2008-01-13T00:39:00.000Z	LamerMan	soundray	yeah absolutelly, i provoke SIGSEGV
2008-01-13T00:40:00.000Z	LamerMan	soundray	maybe i could find them on entire hard drive. How do these files name? *core*? or *core.*
2008-01-13T00:40:00.000Z	soundray	LamerMan	core.*
2008-01-13T00:41:00.000Z	LamerMan	soundray	ok thanks, i';; try to look up for them
2008-01-13T00:41:00.000Z	soundray	LamerMan	rather than 'find', I suggest you use 'sudo updatedb ; locate core'
2008-01-13T00:41:00.000Z	LamerMan	soundray	ok thanks
2008-01-13T00:42:00.000Z	soundray	LamerMan	if you still can't find it, please ask again here, or try the #ubuntu-devel channel (it's not strictly ontopic there, but there are more programmers there and they might sympathize ;)
2008-01-13T00:43:00.000Z	LamerMan	soundray	that channel really seems to be more suitable :)
2008-01-13T00:44:00.000Z	soundray	LamerMan	it's not really for generic support, though -- wear a flame-proof vest ;)
