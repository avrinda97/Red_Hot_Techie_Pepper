2006-11-20T12:08:00.000Z	Atomiku		Is there a decent remote desktop program that I can use that is really fast?
2006-11-20T12:08:00.000Z	Atomiku		Ive tried a few VNC programs
2006-11-20T12:08:00.000Z	Atomiku		but they lag

2006-11-20T12:10:00.000Z	kmaynard	Atomiku	www.nomachine.com
2006-11-20T12:10:00.000Z	Atomiku	kmaynard	Thanks dude, I'll check it out now
2006-11-20T12:11:00.000Z	kmaynard	Atomiku	i tried freenx, with no luck...nomachine works well
2006-11-20T12:19:00.000Z	Atomiku	kmaynard	Hmm how do I install nomachine nx?
2006-11-20T12:19:00.000Z	kmaynard	Atomiku	you need 3 packages (in this order): nxclient, nxnode, nxserver
2006-11-20T12:20:00.000Z	kmaynard	Atomiku	download the debs into their own directory, dpkg -i nx*.deb , then apt-get install -f
2006-11-20T12:20:00.000Z	kmaynard	Atomiku	the server wont install without the client
2006-11-20T12:21:00.000Z	kmaynard	Atomiku	and you will need the client only on remote machines
2006-11-20T12:32:00.000Z	kmaynard	Atomiku	it should start after its installed
2006-11-20T12:33:00.000Z	kmaynard	Atomiku	/etc/init.d/nxserver restart
2006-11-20T12:35:00.000Z	kmaynard	Atomiku	where is the server?
2006-11-20T12:35:00.000Z	kmaynard	Atomiku	are you on the same lan?
2006-11-20T12:35:00.000Z	kmaynard	Atomiku	try connecting from a remote machine
2006-11-20T12:36:00.000Z	kmaynard	Atomiku	there's the problem
2006-11-20T12:36:00.000Z	kmaynard	Atomiku	pm'ing you...
