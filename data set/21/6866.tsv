2007-03-24T12:32:00.000Z	variant	anirudha	you should try vlc and the firefox vlc plugin.. tends to play everything except anything with drm infections
2007-03-24T12:33:00.000Z	anirudha	variant	Do I need to install both vlc on ubuntu in general and install the vlc plugin for the firefox browser>
2007-03-24T12:34:00.000Z	variant	anirudha	yes
2007-03-25T11:54:00.000Z	variant	anirudha	no, could be shareware
2007-03-25T11:54:00.000Z	variant	anirudha	or freeware
2007-03-25T11:54:00.000Z	anirudha	variant	oh okay ... so freeware can be closed source?
2007-03-25T11:54:00.000Z	variant	anirudha	it generaly is
2007-03-25T11:55:00.000Z	anirudha	variant	oh okay .. thanks!
2007-03-25T11:55:00.000Z	variant	anirudha	open source is not a very good term really, if microsoft released the source code to windows vista but with a licence that said you can only look at it but not actualy use it in any way then they could legitimatly call it open source, but it would be "Free" software
2007-03-25T11:55:00.000Z	variant	anirudha	free as in speech
2007-03-25T11:56:00.000Z	variant	anirudha	thats why you should be wary of companies that say they are "open source companies" or something simmilar.. normally it's total bs
2007-03-25T11:57:00.000Z	anirudha	variant	Good example ... thanks for the clarification.
2007-03-25T11:57:00.000Z	variant	anirudha	np
