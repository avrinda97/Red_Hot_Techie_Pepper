2007-08-05T07:32:00.000Z	Jaikkanen		moment ago, ubuntu seemed to have partially crashed, after rebooting, i was prompted that my system does not have apt-get.. and suggested i write apt-get install apt.. in order to get it, which after doing so only prompted me the same thing.. what has happened, and how can i get ubuntu running again?
2007-08-05T07:33:00.000Z	jetscreamer	Jaikkanen	try aptitude install maybe
2007-08-05T07:33:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	jetscreamer	well now im running from the install CD.. how would i do it from here?
2007-08-05T07:33:00.000Z	jetscreamer	Jaikkanen	chroot in
2007-08-05T07:34:00.000Z	jetscreamer	Jaikkanen	don't pay attention to the botspam
2007-08-05T07:35:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	jetscreamer	what do i do then?
2007-08-05T07:36:00.000Z	jetscreamer	Jaikkanen	this should help you figure it out
2007-08-05T07:36:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	jetscreamer	can i do this from the terminal (running this install cd)
2007-08-05T07:37:00.000Z	jetscreamer	Jaikkanen	wait that link was lame.. and yes you can
2007-08-05T07:37:00.000Z	jetscreamer	Jaikkanen	just mount your partition somewhere and do chroot /mountpoint
2007-08-05T07:39:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	jetscreamer	maybe i should just backup my data onto my other partition and reinstall, im just way confused
2007-08-05T07:39:00.000Z	jetscreamer	Jaikkanen	if you're more comfortable with that, sure go ahead
2007-08-05T07:39:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	jetscreamer	weirdly, but thankfully.. all i can see on my linux partition is 2 folders.. one being my personal data.. which is odd
2007-08-05T07:40:00.000Z	jetscreamer	Jaikkanen	yes that is weird, unless you have multiple partitioning scheme... what is the other directory?
2007-08-05T07:55:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	jetscreamer	got another question for you, how can i have my HDD's checked for errors.. as i had to shut off my computer before, so yeah.. how would i have them checked and corrected while running my live CD here
2007-08-05T07:55:00.000Z	jetscreamer	Jaikkanen	shutdown -Fr now
2007-08-05T07:56:00.000Z	jetscreamer	Jaikkanen	or fsck /dev/hda or whatever is the target ... -Fr
2007-08-05T07:56:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	jetscreamer	im not sure how to do that, but yes, i dont believe any are currently mounted
2007-08-05T07:58:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	jetscreamer	thanks, appreciate it
2007-08-05T08:03:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	jetscreamer	i checked my HDDs.. sda3 which is my root, had been repaired.. but stated there were still some exsisting errors
2007-08-05T08:04:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	jetscreamer	is that something to be alarmed about? or have those sectors been blocked off now or?
