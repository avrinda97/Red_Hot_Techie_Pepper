2007-06-11T12:45:00.000Z	yigal	pagan0ne	why do you say that, this is not true, he needs free disk space not necessarily to install on the hd?
2007-06-11T12:46:00.000Z	pagan0ne	yigal	if he's running off livecd, and has downloaded the file, his virtual disk is about full, and in my expirence ubuntu livecd doesnt like dealing with large files
2007-06-11T12:47:00.000Z	yigal	pagan0ne	It really depends on ram, on my 512mb ram machine yes on a 2gb creature not necessarily ?
2007-06-11T12:48:00.000Z	pagan0ne	yigal	i am running w/ 4Gb ram, and i had trouble downloading winxp pro, unzipping it (1.4 ish GB between the zip and the iso
2007-06-11T12:48:00.000Z	yigal	pagan0ne	yes, I agree this is a lot of for 4gb of ram
2007-06-11T12:49:00.000Z	pagan0ne	yigal	my point is, that even with alot of ram, it can be filled up quickly if he's running off livecd trying to do it
2007-06-11T12:54:00.000Z	yigal	pagan0ne	 has that program improved over half a year ago?
2007-06-11T12:54:00.000Z	yigal	pagan0ne	I mean kiba?
2007-06-11T12:54:00.000Z	pagan0ne	yigal	i dont know yet... lol still fighting
2007-06-11T12:55:00.000Z	yigal	pagan0ne	I compiled it about a half year ago, it takes a little effort but it didn't seem worth it.  I would give you my deb or config file but I through the lot out it really wasn't worth it
2007-06-11T12:55:00.000Z	yigal	pagan0ne	s/through/threw excuse me
2007-06-11T12:55:00.000Z	pagan0ne	yigal	well i saw a video on youtube with beryl and kiba-dock installed, and it looked pretty slick
2007-06-11T12:56:00.000Z	yigal	pagan0ne	it looks slick. the problem is kiba dock is really easily controllable and so everything is flying this way and that most of the time
2007-06-11T12:56:00.000Z	yigal	pagan0ne	excuse me "not really controllable"
2007-06-11T12:58:00.000Z	pagan0ne	yigal	well ill see when i get done fighting, if i dont just fsck it first
2007-06-11T13:00:00.000Z	yigal	pagan0ne	then I wish you luck on the kiba build :)
2007-06-11T13:00:00.000Z	pagan0ne	yigal	i _think_ i just finished... lol
2007-06-11T13:02:00.000Z	yigal	pagan0ne	enjoy, but I think if you are like me you will soon get tired of the stuff flying around the screen :) but I hope you enjoy
2007-06-11T13:02:00.000Z	pagan0ne	yigal	well i like to play with the stuff, i may never use it again, but i like to expirment and learn, and if i like it, i may keep it...
2007-06-11T13:04:00.000Z	yigal	pagan0ne	linux that is what its about, experimentation
2007-06-11T13:04:00.000Z	pagan0ne	yigal	yeah thats what they said about acid too
