2008-11-22T19:56:00.000Z	chfwiggum		hi all! apt-get updates ignores several repos in my sources.list-what might be the prob?
2008-11-22T19:57:00.000Z	LjL	chfwiggum	pastebin the sources.list
2008-11-22T19:57:00.000Z	chfwiggum	LjL	standard sources-list added launchpad
2008-11-22T19:58:00.000Z	LjL	chfwiggum	well so does it give any errors?
2008-11-22T19:58:00.000Z	chfwiggum	LjL	ill paste u the apt-get update output  ... mom
2008-11-22T20:02:00.000Z	chfwiggum	LjL	http://pastebin.ca/1264355    apt-get update output
2008-11-22T20:03:00.000Z	LjL	chfwiggum	the only weird thing i see there is "Hole:1 http://ppa.launchpad.net intrepid Release [27,6kB]"
2008-11-22T20:03:00.000Z	chfwiggum	LjL	its german means like fetch
2008-11-22T20:03:00.000Z	LjL	chfwiggum	ah, oops
2008-11-22T20:04:00.000Z	chfwiggum	LjL	but then so many repos ignored-why?
2008-11-22T20:04:00.000Z	LjL	chfwiggum	then i see nothing at all wrong... if it's the "ign"s you're worried about, those are normal
2008-11-22T20:04:00.000Z	LjL	chfwiggum	they are simply saying that nothing in that repository has changed since last time you updated
2008-11-22T20:04:00.000Z	chfwiggum	LjL	but those ign leave me with those repos unable to update
2008-11-22T20:05:00.000Z	LjL	chfwiggum	because there's nothing to update
2008-11-22T20:06:00.000Z	chfwiggum	LjL	ok, i tried to install amarok2 which is in the launchpad-repo, but adept wouldnt find it
2008-11-22T20:08:00.000Z	LjL	chfwiggum	that ppa line doesn't look very right to me, what does it say in sources.list?
2008-11-22T20:10:00.000Z	LjL	chfwiggum	the package name for amarok 2 testing in that repo seems to be "amarok-kde4"
2008-11-22T20:12:00.000Z	chfwiggum	LjL	i know, >invalid operation
2008-11-22T20:13:00.000Z	LjL	chfwiggum	hmm? what does it say exactly?
2008-11-22T20:14:00.000Z	chfwiggum	LjL	well, from de to en like operation not valid,
2008-11-22T20:25:00.000Z	LjL	chfwiggum	ok what did you type though
