2011-11-04T08:04:00.000Z	urlin2u	not_booting	are you familiar with the bootscript?
2011-11-04T08:06:00.000Z	urlin2u	not_booting	how are you getting that if you have b=no boot and can't get a cd to boot.
2011-11-04T08:08:00.000Z	urlin2u	not_booting	do you know the key prompt to get the boot from menu outside the bios f12 ia quite common so you could boot the cd with all drives plugged in a run the bootscript.   Also is one HD a slave?
2011-11-04T08:12:00.000Z	urlin2u	not_booting	it is not that uncommon for a cd to not boot being first in the bios that is why you want to know the out of bios key prompt for choosing the boot from a gui.
2011-11-04T08:15:00.000Z	not_booting	urlin2u	i ran the script http://paste.ubuntu.com/727848/
2011-11-04T08:15:00.000Z	urlin2u	not_booting	cool hold on
2011-11-04T08:19:00.000Z	urlin2u	not_booting	you have syslinux in the sdb mbr not grub it is as you suggetsed reading that way as the cd shows as sda, so use this link with the cd to follow the default on the link use the fdsik to confirm how your ubuntu partition is showing and if still sdb use the commands with sdb and sdb7 if fdisk reads thenm that way. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Copy_LiveCD_Files
2011-11-04T08:23:00.000Z	urlin2u	not_booting	cool it will never boot with syslinux in the mbr
2011-11-04T08:24:00.000Z	urlin2u	not_booting	did you not post the whole results.txt as well?
2011-11-04T08:26:00.000Z	urlin2u	not_booting	read the link you have a fdisk -l command to confirm the stuff and two commands one mounts the partition and the second puts grub in the mbr.
2011-11-04T08:29:00.000Z	urlin2u	not_booting	cool the instructions are clear the ubuntu lines showing show the right files, but since you did not post the whole results.txt we assume  here that the grub files in the partition are okay, and your problem is no grub in the mbr=sdb
