2010-11-12T08:15:00.000Z	JakeCulpin		echo31, I decrypted the disk already.

2010-11-12T08:15:00.000Z	JakeCulpin		I just want to be able to boot back into my OS.

2010-11-12T08:16:00.000Z	JakeCulpin		I just want to get rid of this annoying truecrypt pre-boot auth crap and boot.
2010-11-12T08:16:00.000Z	JakeCulpin		I used the recovery disk with win7 to try and repair the MBR, no help.
2010-11-12T08:17:00.000Z	JakeCulpin		So I'll have to backup all my shit onto a drive + reinstall Windblows?
2010-11-12T08:18:00.000Z	JakeCulpin		apologies.
2010-11-12T08:18:00.000Z	JakeCulpin		Yeah, As I said, I'm able to edit/check files on my hdds using ubuntu
2010-11-12T08:18:00.000Z	tjackGNU	JakeCulpin	you'll have to do this on Windows: [1] /fixboot [2] /fixmbr, [3] bootsect /nt60 ALL /force /mbr. This you will make after you boot with the CD, and you gonna click on "Repair my computer", and then select the Command prompt....
2010-11-12T08:19:00.000Z	JakeCulpin	tjackGNU	I'm assuming you want me to do this at the recovery menu command prompt?
2010-11-12T08:21:00.000Z	tjackGNU	JakeCulpin	nope. Boot with the Windows DVD, then "Install", and then "Repair my computer", there will be some more options and you'll choose a command prompt and you'll excte those commands.
2010-11-12T08:21:00.000Z	JakeCulpin	tjackGNU	Yeah i did that before, apart from one of those, so I shall try.
2010-11-12T08:22:00.000Z	tjackGNU	JakeCulpin	then you'll have your Windows again.
2010-11-12T08:22:00.000Z	tjackGNU	JakeCulpin	the MBR have a filesystem?
2010-11-12T08:23:00.000Z	JakeCulpin	tjackGNU	as far as I know.
2010-11-12T08:24:00.000Z	JakeCulpin	tjackGNU	this is Windows7 btw.
2010-11-12T08:25:00.000Z	tjackGNU	JakeCulpin	well... I had the same problem with a criptographed disk, and afer those commands in the Windos installation, I was able to boot in it again.
2010-11-12T08:28:00.000Z	tjackGNU	JakeCulpin	that's why I hate so bad this crypt-stuffs... This is for Osama Bin Laden's PC...
2010-11-12T08:29:00.000Z	JakeCulpin	tjackGNU	yeah
