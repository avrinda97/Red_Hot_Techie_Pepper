2005-06-26T13:13:00.000Z	hondje	jamey3	has a real problem, ol' hondje spent a good two hours on it and couldn't solve it
2005-06-26T13:18:00.000Z	hondje	jamey3	post the ones I picked out for you
2005-06-26T13:19:00.000Z	hondje	jamey3	if no one can help you, I have some dumb ideas
2005-06-26T13:20:00.000Z	hondje	jamey3	install the fancy drivers
2005-06-26T13:20:00.000Z	hondje	jamey3	Um, I dunno....apt-get install fglrx-control xorg-driver-fglrx I guess
2005-06-26T13:22:00.000Z	hondje	jamey3	that's what I did, apt-cache search fglrx
2005-06-26T13:22:00.000Z	jamey3	hondje	ok great. What does fglrx mean>
2005-06-26T13:22:00.000Z	hondje	jamey3	I dunno, never had an ATI card
2005-06-26T13:23:00.000Z	jamey3	hondje	okay thanks. It says 17.9MB!
2005-06-26T13:23:00.000Z	hondje	jamey3	I'm guessing 'FireGLRadeonXtreme'
2005-06-26T13:23:00.000Z	jamey3	hondje	stupid ATI folk, naming their architecture with such exciting names
2005-06-26T13:24:00.000Z	jamey3	hondje	how do I "get" that driver.. or are you just saying that's the name?
2005-06-26T13:25:00.000Z	hondje	jamey3	Um, my guess is apt-get install fglrx-control xorg-driver-fglrx fglrx-kernel-source
2005-06-26T13:26:00.000Z	jamey3	hondje	whoops I did the first command you gave me. is that okay?
2005-06-26T13:26:00.000Z	hondje	jamey3	yeah, just missing the kernel source thiingy
2005-06-26T13:27:00.000Z	hondje	jamey3	no way
2005-06-26T13:27:00.000Z	jamey3	hondje	aw, I just wanna'd to say something l33t for once. ;)
2005-06-26T13:28:00.000Z	hondje	jamey3	in hondje land, we're installing a new driver for your card....we edit xorg.conf AGAIN, and see what happens?
2005-06-26T13:47:00.000Z	hondje	jamey3	so that took only what, 4 hours worth of messing around?
2005-06-26T13:48:00.000Z	hondje	jamey3	on the plus side, I learned ya' some sshd and the like
