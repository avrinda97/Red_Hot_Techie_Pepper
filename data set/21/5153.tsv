2007-12-12T03:09:00.000Z	Fawkesfyre		ive got 2.6.22-14-generic... the EXTRAVERSION in the Make file is set to = .9 ... so I need to change it to -14-generic correct?
2007-12-12T03:10:00.000Z	Upayavira	Fawkesfyre	if you're using the "old" approach to building a kernel, then you can use --append-to-version as well as changing EXTRAVERSION
2007-12-12T03:10:00.000Z	Upayavira	Fawkesfyre	see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/Compile
2007-12-12T03:10:00.000Z	Fawkesfyre	Upayavira	 thank you
2007-12-12T03:25:00.000Z	Fawkesfyre	Upayavira	 i just need to compile a special driver... and the txt file im reading says to make sure the EXTRAVERSION in the /lib/modules/2.6*/build/Makefile matches the last part of uname -r
2007-12-12T03:26:00.000Z	Fawkesfyre	Upayavira	 it had .9 and I changed it to -14-generic and was wondering if that was the proper syntax
2007-12-12T03:26:00.000Z	Upayavira	Fawkesfyre	Yeah, I'm not sure whether it is -14-generic or .14-generic
2007-12-12T03:27:00.000Z	Fawkesfyre	Upayavira	well thanks i guess I can try both if nothing else ;)
2007-12-12T03:27:00.000Z	Upayavira	Fawkesfyre	but, beware, you should build it with a _different_ number/code, as you don't want to build a new kernel with the same number as the one you're riunning
2007-12-12T03:27:00.000Z	Upayavira	Fawkesfyre	that will cause all sorts of problems
2007-12-12T03:27:00.000Z	Fawkesfyre	Upayavira	oh
2007-12-12T03:27:00.000Z	Upayavira	Fawkesfyre	that is what I'm currently struggling with - working out how to set the right problem
2007-12-12T03:28:00.000Z	Upayavira	Fawkesfyre	basically, if you recompile to the same verison number, you loose the option to roll back to a known state
2007-12-12T03:28:00.000Z	Fawkesfyre	Upayavira	good luck.. if I figure something out, ill pass it on
2007-12-12T03:28:00.000Z	Upayavira	Fawkesfyre	:-)
2007-12-12T03:28:00.000Z	Fawkesfyre	Upayavira	 im not worried about that i dont have  a previous state
2007-12-12T03:29:00.000Z	Fawkesfyre	Upayavira	i just want ubuntu to learn to speak modem
2007-12-12T03:29:00.000Z	Upayavira	Fawkesfyre	presumably you are running a kernel now?
2007-12-12T03:29:00.000Z	Fawkesfyre	Upayavira	 ;)
2007-12-12T03:29:00.000Z	Upayavira	Fawkesfyre	if you recompile with the same version,but get something wrong, you could end up with a dead system
2007-12-12T03:29:00.000Z	Fawkesfyre	Upayavira	ive got 2.6.22 installed and running
