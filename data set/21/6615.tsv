2007-02-28T17:34:00.000Z	soundray	crdlb	do not recommend sudo passwd please (waffles)
2007-02-28T17:34:00.000Z	crdlb	soundray	if he wants to do it, why not?
2007-02-28T17:34:00.000Z	soundray	crdlb	because his security is ultimately our security, too (thinking of botnets)
2007-03-02T14:29:00.000Z	crdlb	soundray	if he really broke firefox ephy won't work either
2007-03-02T14:30:00.000Z	soundray	crdlb	there's a good chance that installing it will fix whatever is broken, though
2007-03-05T17:50:00.000Z	crdlb	soundray	I think you need a semicolon before the done
2007-03-05T17:50:00.000Z	soundray	crdlb	no, I don't
2007-03-05T17:52:00.000Z	soundray	crdlb	if I did that, it wouldn't work if no firefox was running to begin with, because the loop would not continue
2007-03-05T17:52:00.000Z	crdlb	soundray	in that case, nm
2007-05-02T16:53:00.000Z	crdlb	soundray	msttcorefonts
2007-05-02T16:54:00.000Z	soundray	crdlb	no, that one doesn't provide Helvetica. In fact, it only provides truetype fonts.
2007-05-02T16:55:00.000Z	soundray	crdlb	(Helvetica is not truetype)
2007-05-02T16:55:00.000Z	crdlb	soundray	helvetica isn't a truetype font?
2007-05-02T16:59:00.000Z	soundray	crdlb	I get 'bad font: -adobe-helvetica-medium-r-normal--14-140-75-75-p-77-iso8859-1' from an X application on one of my ubuntu machines, but not others (running the client remotely on the same machine each time).
2007-05-02T05:56:00.000Z	soundray	crdlb	I found out what the problem was
2007-05-02T05:57:00.000Z	soundray	crdlb	for some reason, xorg.conf was pointing to /usr/share/X11/fonts/Type1 instead of /usr/share/fonts/X11/Type1 after upgrading (edgy-feisty)
2007-05-13T05:36:00.000Z	soundray	crdlb	have you noticed that quoting doesn't seem to help when you're using scp?
2007-05-13T05:37:00.000Z	crdlb	soundray	haven't tried that, I usually tab-complete everything which just escapes spaces with \
2007-05-13T05:37:00.000Z	soundray	crdlb	also fails when you're scp'ing
2008-09-07T00:15:00.000Z	crdlb	soundray	not with such an old card
2008-09-07T00:15:00.000Z	soundray	crdlb	I see -- what would you suggest?
