2007-01-03T17:22:00.000Z	talisein		Hi, for some reason anytime I try to write anywhere up-tree from /home/, it says No space left on device, even though du reports only 10% is used
2007-01-03T17:24:00.000Z	talisein		ls
2007-01-03T17:26:00.000Z	talisein		Hi, creating files in /home reports "No space left on device", even though df reports only 10% is used. What's wrong?

2007-01-03T17:29:00.000Z	ikonia	talisein	do you have space
2007-01-03T17:31:00.000Z	ikonia	talisein	show me the mount options for /home
2007-01-03T17:31:00.000Z	talisein	ikonia	just ext3 defaults. mount only shows (rw)
2007-01-03T17:32:00.000Z	ikonia	talisein	nothing silly  like md0 has a dead disk so its gone read only
2007-01-03T17:32:00.000Z	talisein	ikonia	mdadm reports md0 is fine
2007-01-03T17:35:00.000Z	ikonia	talisein	that shouldn't matter, but I see what your trying
2007-01-03T17:36:00.000Z	ikonia	talisein	what file system is on it ?
2007-01-03T17:37:00.000Z	talisein	ikonia	ext3
2007-01-03T17:42:00.000Z	ikonia	talisein	is there any data on it
2007-01-03T17:42:00.000Z	talisein	ikonia	sure. My Desktop, .gconf files etc
2007-01-03T17:43:00.000Z	ikonia	talisein	I'm probably wrong but I want to say its got to be a read only problem with a bad error message
2007-01-03T17:43:00.000Z	talisein	ikonia	the logs show gconf errors starting yesterday afternoon from there being no room, but there are no log messages prior to them starting
2007-01-03T17:43:00.000Z	talisein	ikonia	hmm let me try
2007-01-03T17:58:00.000Z	talisein	ikonia	I was using all available inodes, but not all available blocks
2007-01-03T17:58:00.000Z	ikonia	talisein	ahhhhhh thats interesting
2007-01-03T06:00:00.000Z	ikonia	talisein	you can't use tune
2007-01-03T06:00:00.000Z	ikonia	talisein	you need to move the data, and re-create th efile system
