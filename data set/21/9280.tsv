2006-08-12T08:16:00.000Z	tim1		hello everyone, i have a serious problem with my ubuntu install, i can't login anymore
2006-08-12T08:17:00.000Z	tim1		it just keeps going back to the login screen
2006-08-12T08:19:00.000Z	tim1		When I try to login I keep going back to the login screen, anybody an idea?
2006-08-12T08:21:00.000Z	cge	tim1	Make sure you don't have a tab in your password :)
2006-08-12T08:22:00.000Z	cge	tim1	Hmm...
2006-08-12T08:23:00.000Z	cge	tim1	Why not?
2006-08-12T08:23:00.000Z	cge	tim1	Oh. Well, that might be a framebuffer problem in addition to the login problem.
2006-08-12T08:24:00.000Z	cge	tim1	Have you tried changing to a different session, like the failsafe xterm?
2006-08-12T08:25:00.000Z	tim1	cge	i tried all sessions available
2006-08-12T08:25:00.000Z	cge	tim1	oh dear.
2006-08-12T08:25:00.000Z	cge	tim1	You can't really do anything if you can't log in with gdm and you can't get to a terminal.
2006-08-12T08:27:00.000Z	cge	tim1	You'll have to restart, and do something to get a terminal.
2006-08-12T08:27:00.000Z	tim1	cge	and then?
2006-08-12T08:27:00.000Z	cge	tim1	Do you have a vga= on your modeline?
2006-08-12T08:27:00.000Z	cge	tim1	Look at ~/.xsession-errors
2006-08-12T08:31:00.000Z	cge	tim1	Ah. In that case yes, just look at that file, and see what it says.
2006-08-12T08:35:00.000Z	tim1	cge	the .xsession-errors is empty
2006-08-12T08:35:00.000Z	cge	tim1	Oh.
2006-08-12T08:35:00.000Z	cge	tim1	Are you running edgy?
2006-08-12T08:37:00.000Z	cge	tim1	I'll be in ubuntu+1 if you want to go there, even though there usually aren't to many people to help there.
2006-08-12T08:38:00.000Z	cge	tim1	Yes, you probably should join #ubuntu+1
