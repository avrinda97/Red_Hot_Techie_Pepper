2008-07-25T01:07:00.000Z	WatchDragon		how do i map a drive in ubuntu/gnome? im using samba to talk to my XP machine, i have a shared folder and all that in XP..
2008-07-25T01:07:00.000Z	Mecha25	WatchDragon	go to Network, under Places, it should show up there
2008-07-25T01:11:00.000Z	WatchDragon	Mecha25	i am thinking i have do manually map the drive, like i had to do in XP
2008-07-25T01:12:00.000Z	Mecha25	WatchDragon	just double click it, it'll map for you
2008-07-25T01:14:00.000Z	Mecha25	WatchDragon	double clicking not working?
2008-07-25T01:15:00.000Z	WatchDragon	Mecha25	i can see the workgroup my XP box is on, i cant see the shared folder, so no, i cant doubble click anything
2008-07-25T01:15:00.000Z	Mecha25	WatchDragon	hm... that's odd, it should be there.  do you have it set on XP so that anyone can access it?
2008-07-25T01:18:00.000Z	WatchDragon	Mecha25	actually i think i have a permission problem
2008-07-25T01:18:00.000Z	Mecha25	WatchDragon	make sure XP is set to give read access to everyone
2008-07-25T01:20:00.000Z	WatchDragon	Mecha25	i think i need to give read / write permisions in linux so my XP can write to it
2008-07-25T01:21:00.000Z	Mecha25	WatchDragon	ah! ok, one sec, I'll find the command, I know what you need
2008-07-25T01:22:00.000Z	WatchDragon	Mecha25	go into console and do something like sudo chmod /home/share 644?
2008-07-25T01:22:00.000Z	Mecha25	WatchDragon	nope, it's a samba thing, you have to change sharing permissions
2008-07-25T01:22:00.000Z	WatchDragon	Mecha25	ahh, ill wait for hte command
2008-07-25T01:23:00.000Z	WatchDragon	Mecha25	ok, gona have a looks
2008-07-25T01:30:00.000Z	WatchDragon	Mecha25	i have it set up now, im sharing my folder, with read/write access, and when i try to copy a file in xp, i get a access denied... i dont have to reboot XP do i?
2008-07-25T01:31:00.000Z	Mecha25	WatchDragon	are you copying from XP to linux, or from linux to XP?
2008-07-25T01:31:00.000Z	WatchDragon	Mecha25	XP to my lilnux share
2008-07-25T01:32:00.000Z	Mecha25	WatchDragon	yeah, try rebooting xp
2008-07-25T01:32:00.000Z	WatchDragon	Mecha25	i did thi in Debain like 7 years ago, lol, i dont know why im havign all kinda of trouble
2008-07-25T01:33:00.000Z	Mecha25	WatchDragon	Ubuntu's default samba configs are weird, once you tweak them they work amazingly well though
