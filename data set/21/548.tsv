2012-01-06T16:49:00.000Z	throstur		how do i update kernel?
2012-01-06T16:50:00.000Z	iceroot	throstur	update or upgrade?
2012-01-06T16:52:00.000Z	iceroot	throstur	why do you need a kernel-upgrade?
2012-01-06T16:55:00.000Z	iceroot	throstur	depending on the problem
2012-01-06T16:55:00.000Z	iceroot	throstur	if it will affect others to, there is a chance
2012-01-06T16:57:00.000Z	iceroot	throstur	which ubuntu-version?
2012-01-06T16:57:00.000Z	iceroot	throstur	that means 11.10?
2012-01-06T16:58:00.000Z	iceroot	throstur	so you want 3.1 or 3.2 i guess
2012-01-06T16:58:00.000Z	iceroot	throstur	please put the name in front of a text
2012-01-06T16:58:00.000Z	throstur	iceroot	ok
2012-01-06T16:58:00.000Z	iceroot	throstur	3.2 is build in 12.04
2012-01-06T16:58:00.000Z	iceroot	throstur	but i dont think there is a driver for bc43 included
2012-01-06T16:59:00.000Z	iceroot	throstur	normally you dont need 3.2 for that
2012-01-06T16:59:00.000Z	iceroot	throstur	bc43 devices has nonfree-firmware and cant be included into the kernel (see message from ubottu how to fix that)
2012-01-06T17:00:00.000Z	iceroot	throstur	the firmware is the problem, not the driver
2012-01-06T17:00:00.000Z	throstur	iceroot	right, so I need to update the kernel and download new firmware, is that correct?
2012-01-06T17:01:00.000Z	iceroot	throstur	no need for a newer kernel
2012-01-06T17:01:00.000Z	iceroot	throstur	and normally ubuntu will over the specific firmware-download
2012-01-06T17:03:00.000Z	throstur	iceroot	the b43 list of supported devices states that kernel 3.1+ is necessary but ubuntu 11.10 uses a slightly older kernel - how come I don't need to get a new kernel?
2012-01-06T17:06:00.000Z	iceroot	throstur	ah 3.1, ok
2012-01-06T17:06:00.000Z	iceroot	throstur	have a look at the backports if 3.1 or 3.2 is there
