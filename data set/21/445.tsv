2012-08-01T00:44:00.000Z	Relondo		Sarbull: Do you think it's overheating because you feel heat, or because you are using a heat monitor? Also, did this ever happen with Windows?
2012-08-01T00:45:00.000Z	Relondo		Sarbull: Because if you just feel it near the fan, that just means that the fan is working.
2012-08-01T00:46:00.000Z	Relondo		Sarbull: My laptop is always warm near the fan. But the rest of it is fine. It's just the fan doing its job.
2012-08-01T00:47:00.000Z	Relondo		Sarbull: Possibly in the BIOS.
2012-08-01T00:47:00.000Z	Relondo		Sarbull: Or take a look at this: http://superuser.com/questions/324210/ubuntu-11-04-disable-nvidia-graphics-card
2012-08-01T00:47:00.000Z	Relondo		Sarbull: Not your card, but the same question.
2012-08-01T00:49:00.000Z	Relondo		Sarbull: Maybe use one of those "turn it on" options.
2012-08-01T00:50:00.000Z	Relondo		Osmosis: Go to the dash, and search for "system monitor".
2012-08-01T00:51:00.000Z	Relondo		Osmosis: One of the tabs (I think the far left one) will tell you.
2012-08-01T00:51:00.000Z	Relondo		Osmosis: Don't know how to do it from CMD. But just hit your Windows key, or whatever you have, or just click the dash button, and search "system monitor".
2012-08-01T00:51:00.000Z	benste	Relondo	package cache might show you which version of e.g. FF is installed
2012-08-01T00:52:00.000Z	Relondo	benste	What now?

2012-08-01T00:59:00.000Z	Relondo	benste	Is this a Wubi install or standard?
