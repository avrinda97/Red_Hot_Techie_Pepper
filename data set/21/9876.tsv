2007-05-14T06:12:00.000Z	evo		I've got a problem with Wireless internet in Ubuntu Fiesty. It won't detect anything, even unsecured networks
2007-05-14T06:13:00.000Z	evo		Windows seems fine
2007-05-14T06:13:00.000Z	evo		and before I clean installed Fiesty it was fine
2007-05-14T06:13:00.000Z	evo		I'm using Dell Inspiron 1300
2007-05-14T06:13:00.000Z	evo		can anybody suggest a solution?
2007-05-14T06:14:00.000Z	evo		I can't see any wireless networks
2007-05-14T06:14:00.000Z	evo		in the applet
2007-05-14T06:14:00.000Z	evo		or the Manual config tool
2007-05-14T06:15:00.000Z	morpheus	evo	wireless is hell.  There's a whole article on configuring ndiswrapper for the dell
2007-05-14T06:15:00.000Z	evo		I don't use ndiswrapper. It worked out of the box before
2007-05-14T06:16:00.000Z	evo	morpheus	I used iwp**** drivers before
2007-05-14T06:17:00.000Z	morpheus		well, i'm a noob and still trying to get my wireless to work.  there is an article in teh commumity forum/wifi docs
2007-05-14T06:17:00.000Z	evo	morpheus	ok, fair enough
2007-05-14T06:17:00.000Z	evo		thanks
2007-05-14T06:19:00.000Z	morpheus		i had to clean install xp with feisty 3 times before I figured how to get past the MBR issues.  finally partitioned 8G at the beginning of the drive and 2 partitions for xp and feisty.
2007-05-14T06:20:00.000Z	morpheus		?
2007-05-14T06:21:00.000Z	morpheus		up all night trying to get wireless working.  guess it's time to take  a nap before work.  cya
2007-05-14T06:23:00.000Z	evo		hey
2007-05-14T06:23:00.000Z	evo	morpheus	you still here?
2007-05-14T06:24:00.000Z	evo	morpheus	turned out, it was just that the hardware switch on the wireless was off. Normally, an LED goes on/off (at least it does in Windowz)
