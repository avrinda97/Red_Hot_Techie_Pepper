2008-06-26T20:58:00.000Z	Dhraakellian		I need a copy of linux-image-2.6.24-17-generic to repair some packaging brokenness, but I'm not seeing it in the repos
2008-06-26T20:58:00.000Z	Dhraakellian		does anyone know where I might find a package of it?
2008-06-26T20:58:00.000Z	Dhraakellian		I see -16 and -18
2008-06-26T21:00:00.000Z	Dhraakellian		this isn't the first time this has happened.
2008-06-26T21:00:00.000Z	Dhraakellian		my /boot keeps running out of space
2008-06-26T21:00:00.000Z	xtknight	Dhraakellian	you cuold download the package manually off packages.ubuntu.com
2008-06-26T21:01:00.000Z	Dhraakellian	xtknight	and that's pretty much exactly what i was planning to do
2008-06-26T21:01:00.000Z	xtknight	Dhraakellian	ok so you want to rid your system of ubuntu modules 17?
2008-06-26T21:02:00.000Z	xtknight	Dhraakellian	can you paste the exact results when doing dpkg --force-all --purge linux-ubuntu-modules-2.6.24-17
2008-06-26T21:04:00.000Z	Dhraakellian	xtknight	already know to use a pastebin, but thanks for letting me know which one is generally used in this channel
2008-06-26T21:06:00.000Z	xtknight	Dhraakellian	that's right, which is why i would try the force-all
2008-06-26T21:07:00.000Z	Dhraakellian	xtknight	so that the -ubuntu-modules 17 package wouldn't complain when I try to uninstall it
2008-06-26T21:07:00.000Z	xtknight	Dhraakellian	i think force all will fix it, give it atry
2008-06-26T21:08:00.000Z	Dhraakellian	xtknight	http://paste.ubuntu.com/23147/
2008-06-26T21:10:00.000Z	xtknight	Dhraakellian	well this is a little tricky. you say  you have no room left on /boot to accomodate the reinstallation of -17 image?
2008-06-26T21:10:00.000Z	Dhraakellian	xtknight	no.  the lack of space was the entire reason I removed the old kernels
2008-06-26T21:11:00.000Z	xtknight	Dhraakellian	to fix this problem i would be suggesting to reinstall linux image 17, and then uninstall both at once in a clean state
2008-06-26T21:11:00.000Z	Dhraakellian	xtknight	Hah!  That's exactly what I was going to, but I couldn't find the linux image -17 package
2008-06-26T21:12:00.000Z	xtknight	Dhraakellian	ah ya. back to square one.  well i will try and find it
2008-06-26T21:16:00.000Z	xtknight	Dhraakellian	try cd /var/cache
2008-06-26T21:16:00.000Z	xtknight	Dhraakellian	and then "sudo find * | grep linux-image-2.6.24-17"
