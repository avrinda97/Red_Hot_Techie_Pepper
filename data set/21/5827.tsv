2008-10-24T00:25:00.000Z	youknowme		How would one scrape text off an image?
2008-10-24T00:25:00.000Z	spunk	youknowme	use GIMP.
2008-10-24T00:26:00.000Z	youknowme	spunk	I'll look into that.
2008-10-24T00:26:00.000Z	youknowme		thx
2008-10-24T00:28:00.000Z	youknowme	spunk	maybe I'm not looking hard enough. How would I use Gimp to scrape text off of an image?
2008-10-24T00:29:00.000Z	spunk	youknowme	well, it depends what you mean by scraping off. I thought you needed an application to edit pixelated pictures... Can you describe more in detail your needs?
2008-10-24T00:30:00.000Z	youknowme	spunk	I scanned in a paper with text on it, created a png image, now I want to scrape the text off of the image and create a text file.
2008-10-24T00:31:00.000Z	spunk	youknowme	ah, ok. then you need an OCR application. Lets see...
2008-10-24T00:33:00.000Z	spunk	youknowme	look for an app called tesseract-ocr
2008-10-24T00:34:00.000Z	youknowme	spunk	got it, installing now.
2008-10-24T00:34:00.000Z	spunk	youknowme	nice
2008-10-24T00:35:00.000Z	youknowme	spunk	hmm.. running ﻿tesseract-ocr in the terminal tells me command not found..
2008-10-24T00:35:00.000Z	youknowme	spunk	maybe I should try gocr?
2008-10-24T00:35:00.000Z	spunk	youknowme	it seems to me that tesseract only support tiff images. so you need to convert from png to tiff.
2008-10-24T00:36:00.000Z	spunk	youknowme	have you tried "hash -r"?
2008-10-24T00:37:00.000Z	spunk	youknowme	I've installed tessract-ocr. I can run in from terminal with "tesseract".
2008-10-24T00:38:00.000Z	youknowme	spunk	hash -r appears to do nothing, ﻿tesseract-ocr still gives me command not found..
2008-10-24T00:38:00.000Z	youknowme	spunk	I'll look into it, thanks for the help!
2008-10-24T00:41:00.000Z	spunk	youknowme	youre welcome, good luck!
2008-10-24T00:45:00.000Z	youknowme	spunk	well that failed, I got nothing but gibberish.. Guess its time to do it by hand! Ugh..
2008-10-24T00:47:00.000Z	spunk	youknowme	Hello again, I just found this, thought it could be interesting: http://www.howtoforge.com/ocr_with_tesseract_on_ubuntu704
