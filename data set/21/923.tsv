2011-05-03T13:54:00.000Z	MethedMan		anyone know how to send emails anonymously via evolution or any other linux mail program
2011-05-03T13:55:00.000Z	MethedMan		herbs: i don't want to spam
2011-05-03T13:57:00.000Z	invernizzi	MethedMan	no, you cannot send emails anonymously throgh Gmail, unless you create a separate account. Maybe they look anonymous to you, but they are not. Disclamer: I work in computer security
2011-05-03T13:58:00.000Z	MethedMan	invernizzi	what if i send it through tor with namoroka?
2011-05-03T13:58:00.000Z	MethedMan	invernizzi	also i am not so concerned if google knows where things are coming from.  i am more concerned with the immediate parties that i am in contact with that could possible blow my cover
2011-05-03T13:59:00.000Z	invernizzi	MethedMan	no, tor just protects your ip. The thing is, the email still carries meta information about the sender. the correct tool for the job is "mixmaster"
2011-05-03T13:59:00.000Z	invernizzi		it's in the repos
2011-05-03T14:00:00.000Z	MethedMan		invernizzI: downloading now. how do i use it
2011-05-03T14:00:00.000Z	invernizzi	MethedMan	mixmaster strips metadata from emails and forwards the email from server to server to delay it and make it untraceable
2011-05-03T14:01:00.000Z	MethedMan		herbs: not a spammer
2011-05-03T14:01:00.000Z	MethedMan		herbs: troll somewhere else please
2011-05-03T14:01:00.000Z	invernizzi	MethedMan	just launch it, it's pretty self explanatory. keep in mind that the delay between sending and receipt can be of hours. the purpose is to avoid to leak even the time of sending
2011-05-03T14:01:00.000Z	MethedMan	invernizzi	what servers should i connect it to
2011-05-03T14:02:00.000Z	MethedMan	invernizzi	i have 5 options in the install. not sure which one to choose
2011-05-03T14:02:00.000Z	invernizzi	MethedMan	 tell me which options are there
2011-05-03T14:02:00.000Z	MethedMan		herbs: i do not answer to you, and did not appreciate your incorrect assessment
2011-05-03T14:03:00.000Z	MethedMan	invernizzi	no configuration, internet site, internet with smarthost, satellite system, local only
2011-05-03T14:03:00.000Z	invernizzi		local
2011-05-03T14:04:00.000Z	invernizzi		herbs: spammers use botnets to send emails, not remailers. Trust me, this is not the system to send spam. Again, I work exaclty on malware and spam
2011-05-03T14:06:00.000Z	MethedMan	invernizzi	i sent you a private message with a website that i am involved with.
2011-05-03T14:07:00.000Z	invernizzi	MethedMan	seen
