2011-08-10T16:13:00.000Z	Northernen		What is the problem if 'mount' lists my home folder as not mounted, yet I can see its contents (albeit there are problems writing to it)?
2011-08-10T16:13:00.000Z	sim-value	Northernen	is your disk full?
2011-08-10T16:14:00.000Z	Northernen	sim-value	nowhere near it.
2011-08-10T16:14:00.000Z	Northernen	sim-value	but it's not even listed in 'df -h'.
2011-08-10T16:15:00.000Z	Northernen	sim-value	although I have an NTFS partition mounted under my /home, which is quite large. I wouldn't think that would affect it though.
2011-08-10T16:15:00.000Z	sim-value	Northernen	is the NTFS partition your home partition, or is it just mounted there?
2011-08-10T16:16:00.000Z	Northernen	sim-value	it's mounted there. My home partition is a normal ext4 partition.
2011-08-10T16:16:00.000Z	sim-value	Northernen	did you check your /etc/fstab file?
2011-08-10T16:16:00.000Z	Northernen	sim-value	/etc/fstab -> UUID=44C0B828C0B821DA /home/xxx/windows ntfs defaults 0 0
2011-08-10T16:17:00.000Z	sim-value	Northernen	ok, that answers that question...
2011-08-10T16:18:00.000Z	Northernen	sim-value	there's no entry for my home partition, but it's been working up till now, so I always assumed it was done automatically.
2011-08-10T16:19:00.000Z	sim-value	Northernen	there's an entry for my /home in my fstab, so that's probably the error
2011-08-10T16:21:00.000Z	Northernen	sim-value	bit odd though that I am able to use the partition though. Mind pasting your /home fstab entry? Not quite sure what to put as options.
2011-08-10T16:22:00.000Z	sim-value	Northernen	# /home was on /dev/sdb2 during installation
2011-08-10T16:22:00.000Z	Northernen	sim-value	cheers, will try.
2011-08-10T16:23:00.000Z	sim-value	Northernen	But your UUID will be different of course
2011-08-10T16:29:00.000Z	Northernen	sim-value	I think it works. Thank you!
2011-08-10T16:29:00.000Z	sim-value	Northernen	nice :)
2011-08-10T16:32:00.000Z	Northernen	sim-value	it's not working properly though, it lists my partition as having 160 GB (of 170 GB in total) free, but I still get error messages saying "write error: No space left on device".
2011-08-10T16:33:00.000Z	sim-value	Northernen	maybe a Problem with permissions ? did you reboot?
2011-08-10T16:35:00.000Z	Northernen	sim-value	I'm in a sub directory within my own home directory, and the partition is mounted as rw. Shouldn't be a permission issue.
