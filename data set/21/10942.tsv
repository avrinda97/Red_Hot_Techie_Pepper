2006-01-18T10:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	yggdrasil	 let me guess.. you dont have anything in your menus?
2006-01-18T10:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	yggdrasil	  :)  i got all the normal ubuhntu items in my menu.  but then again. I also tend to just have a xterm open.
2006-01-18T10:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	yggdrasil	 it was allready there. :P dident have to do anything. i do Belive theres a package or 2 you install that makes them auto-appear. i think fluxbox is scanning somting - it takes a lot longer to boot up - but everything is there
2006-01-18T10:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	yggdrasil	 to be honest - i dont care much for any of the XYZbox window mangers :P
2006-01-18T10:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	yggdrasil	 they work good. but nothing really outstanding about them :P good for vnc work
2006-01-18T10:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	yggdrasil	 thers several related   forks of the Fluxbox/Openbox/blackbox windoiw managers
2006-01-18T10:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	yggdrasil	 the only one thats Not related with "box' in the name is matchbox. :P
2006-01-19T11:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	yggdrasil	 you still having probolems with it?
2006-01-19T11:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	yggdrasil	 About time! :P
2006-01-19T11:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	yggdrasil	  I say.. dont bother. :P
2006-01-19T11:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	yggdrasil	 you sure its not how the window manager is just using the buttons
