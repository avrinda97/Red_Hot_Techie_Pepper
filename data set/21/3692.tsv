2011-02-20T23:42:00.000Z	Luis_		Hi, I'm having some issues with a new install of ubuntu and had no luck on the forums, am i in the right place to ask for some help, please?
2011-02-20T23:43:00.000Z	blkdg	Luis_	don't ask to ask
2011-02-20T23:47:00.000Z	blkdg	Luis_	which graphics card?
2011-02-20T23:48:00.000Z	Luis_	blkdg	not sure its a built in card in my old Pentium III which i use as a server at home
2011-02-20T23:50:00.000Z	blkdg	Luis_	this machine ran linux before?
2011-02-20T23:52:00.000Z	Luis_	blkdg	if it has then not recently, i beleive i may have had ubuntu installed back in the 7.xx/8.xx days but it has just been used as a file/print server at home running windows since, i'd just like to finnaly get rid of the last windows installation i owned by installing ubuntu on it
2011-02-20T23:56:00.000Z	Luis_	blkdg	I've also tried starting up in "safe mode" and running the package repair tool which went thought a long downloading and installing process but made no difference, it still doesnt work
2011-02-20T23:58:00.000Z	blkdg	Luis_	one sec
2011-02-20T23:59:00.000Z	Luis_	blkdg	no problem!, thanks for helping =)
2011-02-20T23:59:00.000Z	blkdg	Luis_	decribe the boot process again please.
2011-02-21T00:02:00.000Z	Luis_	blkdg	well the computer starts up as normal (currently running 10.04) however when it gets to the login screen (i dont have it set to log in automaticly) i enter my user name and password it then accepts the details fine, goes to log in the screen turns all fuzzy/pixelated and after a few seconds struggleing it just resets back to the login screen... and if i try again the process just repeats
2011-02-21T00:03:00.000Z	Luis_	blkdg	this is happening right after a fresh install, whether its with 10.10 or 10.04
2011-02-21T00:06:00.000Z	blkdg	Luis_	is this a basic install?
2011-02-21T00:07:00.000Z	Luis_	blkdg	as far as i am aware, yes i don't know what you'd call a basic install but its simply been downloaded from the ubuntu site burnt onto a CD and installed as per the standard installer
2011-02-21T00:08:00.000Z	blkdg	Luis_	what i mean is it's not a server version of the os. it's the same one you'd use on grandmas pc right?
2011-02-21T00:09:00.000Z	Luis_	blkdg	Yes, i tried the server install foolishly thinking it had a GUI but when i was faced with terminal i just couldn't coupe, i dont know enough and find it rather frustrating
2011-02-21T00:11:00.000Z	blkdg	Luis_	grab 10.4 or 10.10 standerd 32 bit installer and try again.
2011-02-21T00:12:00.000Z	blkdg	Luis_	the server flavour is ment for headless boxes
2011-02-21T00:13:00.000Z	Luis_	blkdg	its an option but i'd have thought that after installing and reinstalling ubuntu 3 times the answer that reinstalling isn't going to cut it is pretty clear =)
2011-02-21T00:19:00.000Z	Luis_	blkdg	is the recommendation still reinstalling or are you having a think? - just wondering! =)
2011-02-21T00:27:00.000Z	blkdg	Luis_	grab 10.4 or 10.10 standerd 32 bit installer and try again.
