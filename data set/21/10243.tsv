2005-11-05T09:07:00.000Z	maikeru		yeah
2005-11-05T09:07:00.000Z	maikeru		isn't it just like JHymn for Windows
2005-11-05T09:07:00.000Z	maikeru		cause all it does is remove the retardedness so you can actually (SHOCK) listen to the music you paid for
2005-11-05T09:08:00.000Z	maikeru		oh really?
2005-11-05T09:08:00.000Z	maikeru		I did not know this
2005-11-05T09:08:00.000Z	kevogod	maikeru	Not in here
2005-11-05T09:08:00.000Z	maikeru		what about all the m4ps I have bought from iTunes?
2005-11-05T09:09:00.000Z	maikeru		is there a way to convert them under linux
2005-11-05T09:09:00.000Z	kevogod		Oooh, snap!
2005-11-05T09:09:00.000Z	maikeru		so I can listen to them
2005-11-05T09:09:00.000Z	maikeru	nalioth	iTunes encoded all my music
2005-11-05T09:09:00.000Z	maikeru		-all of it-
2005-11-05T09:09:00.000Z	maikeru		even the stuff I didn't get from them
2005-11-05T09:10:00.000Z	maikeru		so now at least 1G of music is lost cause I can't play it under Linux
2005-11-05T09:10:00.000Z	maikeru		so no, it is my right to get the music I bought back
2005-11-05T09:10:00.000Z	maikeru		and I don't see how it isn't allowed in here
2005-11-05T09:10:00.000Z	maikeru		I'm just requesting a program, like many others do
2005-11-05T09:10:00.000Z	kevogod	maikeru	Only the files you downloaded from the iTunes Music Store should have FairPlay DRM on them.
2005-11-05T09:11:00.000Z	kevogod	maikeru	The rest should be playable on Linux.
2005-11-05T09:11:00.000Z	maikeru		mmk, I'll try...
2005-11-05T09:12:00.000Z	kevogod	maikeru	You will need w32codecs I believe.
