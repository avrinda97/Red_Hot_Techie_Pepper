2009-02-14T15:46:00.000Z	nsadmin	Budtske	perhaps the array is not active
2009-02-14T15:46:00.000Z	Budtske	nsadmin	i have it mounted right now using /dev/device in fstab
2009-02-14T15:46:00.000Z	Budtske		can write to it no problem
2009-02-14T15:47:00.000Z	nsadmin		you have the same partition mounted you want mounted somewhere else?
2009-02-14T15:47:00.000Z	Budtske	nsadmin	i did unmount it first before trying to mount it using uuid
2009-02-14T15:47:00.000Z	nsadmin		hmm. what filesystem type?
2009-02-14T15:47:00.000Z	Budtske		ext3
2009-02-14T15:47:00.000Z	nsadmin		that should have a uuid
2009-02-14T15:48:00.000Z	nsadmin		see what's in /dev/disk/by-uuid
2009-02-14T15:48:00.000Z	nsadmin		maybe it's different now... did you format it recently?
2009-02-14T15:49:00.000Z	nsadmin		maybe the kernel doesn't support uuids
2009-02-14T15:49:00.000Z	Budtske	nsadmin	i have my other partitions mounted by uuid
2009-02-14T15:49:00.000Z	nsadmin	Budtske	when was the last time you formatted this parttion?
2009-02-14T15:49:00.000Z	Budtske	nsadmin	and /dev/disk/by-uuid shows my partitions except this one
2009-02-14T15:49:00.000Z	nsadmin		so it's not there?
2009-02-14T15:50:00.000Z	Budtske	nsadmin	today...
2009-02-14T15:50:00.000Z	Budtske	nsadmin	let me guess i should reboot
2009-02-14T15:50:00.000Z	Budtske		doh
2009-02-14T15:50:00.000Z	nsadmin		did you use the uuid that was current yesterday?
2009-02-14T15:50:00.000Z	nsadmin		(or so)
2009-02-14T15:50:00.000Z	Budtske	nsadmin	nope, got it after i formated
