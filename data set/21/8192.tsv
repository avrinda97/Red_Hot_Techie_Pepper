2006-06-19T16:05:00.000Z	gdb	sneex	Do you have the Dell Business Internal Speaker in your system?
2006-06-19T16:06:00.000Z	sneex	gdb	I have 68 of the 620s but they all have the standard system speaker =( nothng fancy
2006-06-19T16:06:00.000Z	gdb	sneex	I have one in my system and Windows played sound through it fine.  However, Ubuntu plays sounds out the sound ports in the back and I'd prefer not to get an external speaker for it.  I'd like to get the sound going through the internal one but I suspect it's software driven.
2006-06-19T16:07:00.000Z	gdb	sneex	It's the $14 internal speaker option on the system.  I have the same kind of machine at home and work.  Sound works just fine trough the ports in the back.
2006-06-19T16:07:00.000Z	gdb	sneex	hehe
2006-06-19T16:07:00.000Z	sneex	gdb	I didnt have any say in what was purchased LOL  =)
2006-06-19T16:07:00.000Z	gdb	sneex	hehe
2006-06-19T16:07:00.000Z	sneex		are you using Brezzy or Dapper?
2006-06-19T16:08:00.000Z	gdb	sneex	Dapper on both.
2006-06-19T16:08:00.000Z	sneex		k
2006-06-19T16:08:00.000Z	gdb		After a many hours long nightmare of trying to mirror the 2 internal disks I ended up just sticking a 3rd disk in there and setting up a /home mirror.
2006-06-19T16:09:00.000Z	gdb		(Which is all I care about, since the OS can be reinstalled and set up in about 20 minutes).
2006-06-19T16:09:00.000Z	sneex	gdb	have you tried playing with the sound controls?  (as root?)
2006-06-19T16:10:00.000Z	gdb	sneex	Yes, I have, nothing stands out to me as enabling that speaker, and nothing that I've selected seems to, either.
2006-06-19T16:10:00.000Z	gdb	sneex	Ah, as root, no.  I've been using the sound control panel as a normal user.  I'll try messing with it as root and seeing if more options are displayed.
2006-06-19T16:10:00.000Z	sneex	gdb	not even noatrun?
2006-06-19T16:10:00.000Z	sneex		if dapper is like brezzy it will become "active" as root
2006-06-19T16:11:00.000Z	sneex		Can any one give an idea as to why Firefox is going to 65.203.229.44 everytime I start it?
2006-06-19T16:11:00.000Z	gdb		!java
2006-06-19T16:12:00.000Z	gdb	sneex	Not set as your homepage? ;-)
