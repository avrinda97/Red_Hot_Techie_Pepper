2011-07-04T20:44:00.000Z	ikonia	Taftse	you don't need to do that
2011-07-04T21:30:00.000Z	ikonia	Taftse	what does the documentation say do ?
2011-07-04T21:31:00.000Z	ikonia	Taftse	follow the install instructions
2011-07-04T21:31:00.000Z	ikonia	Taftse	it gets created when you put the cdrom in
2011-07-04T21:33:00.000Z	ikonia	Taftse	follow the install instructions
2011-07-04T21:34:00.000Z	ikonia	Taftse	you have to put the CD in
2011-07-04T21:35:00.000Z	ikonia	Taftse	no
2011-07-04T21:36:00.000Z	ikonia	Taftse	ask the guys who make vmware - the process is quite straight forward, you get the install package, from a cd, from the net, wherever, and you run the installer script
2011-11-15T14:21:00.000Z	Taftse	ikonia	sorry ?
2011-11-15T14:21:00.000Z	ikonia	Taftse	sorry that was for Ileden
2011-11-15T14:23:00.000Z	ikonia	Taftse	disable that option then
2011-11-15T14:23:00.000Z	ikonia	Taftse	you've changed the ssh_config file
