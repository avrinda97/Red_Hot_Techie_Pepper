2006-12-24T13:02:00.000Z	Ashton_K	exs	note that there's a space between those two /'s
2006-12-24T13:05:00.000Z	Ashton_K	exs	if you don't want to muck in the details, you're in the wrong distro.
2006-12-24T13:05:00.000Z	exs	Ashton_K	 ubuntu is begged to be the easiest distibution
2006-12-24T13:06:00.000Z	Ashton_K	exs	you can drag and drop if you want.
2006-12-24T13:06:00.000Z	exs	Ashton_K	 that isn't  my point.. my point is that there's no nice GUI aplication for backing a system up
2006-12-24T13:06:00.000Z	exs	Ashton_K	 well done, and that's available to you. But hey, there's some people that like GUI better than command, so where do they go?
2006-12-24T13:08:00.000Z	Ashton_K	exs	calm down.
2006-12-24T13:09:00.000Z	exs	Ashton_K	 you shouldn't have to know the name.. ubuntu should have the application for you
2006-12-24T13:09:00.000Z	exs	Ashton_K	 it needs to be installed already.
2006-12-24T13:10:00.000Z	exs	Ashton_K	 yes it does. Normal users don't want to fanny about with installing programs. This is where we can get the advantage over windows. If we don't have that advantage, then there's no point to switch to linux
2006-12-24T13:10:00.000Z	Ashton_K	exs	in case you didn't notice, this is LINUX.
2006-12-24T13:10:00.000Z	exs	Ashton_K	 a backup utility is very important
2006-12-24T13:11:00.000Z	exs	Ashton_K	 Yo know why ubuntu exsists?.. because mark shuttleworth wants the ubuntu cut into the mainstream
2006-12-24T13:12:00.000Z	Ashton_K	exs	Ubuntu lets you do the LEAST amount of work among any distro (including windows) to find software, and install it.
2006-12-24T13:13:00.000Z	Ashton_K	exs	every distro wants to be mainstream.
2006-12-24T13:16:00.000Z	exs	Ashton_K	 are you insane?.. norton ghost.
2006-12-24T13:16:00.000Z	exs	Ashton_K	 Uhm, I think you'll find that the majority of windows users, will actually have the ghost backup cd when they buy the computer
2006-12-24T13:19:00.000Z	exs	Ashton_K	 Yes, I am.. I came from the windows crowd.
2006-12-24T13:26:00.000Z	Ashton_K	exs	if you don't have a support question, don't fill the channel with it.
2006-12-24T14:18:00.000Z	exs	Ashton_K	 are you talking to me?
2006-12-24T14:18:00.000Z	Ashton_K	exs	no.
