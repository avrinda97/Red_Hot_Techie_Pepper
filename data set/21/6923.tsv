2007-04-04T11:32:00.000Z	arooni		hey question about evolution:  does it offer auto complete on the TO field like outlook does?  (its not enabled by default)
2007-04-04T11:33:00.000Z	adorablepuppy	arooni	I dont think so, but the To button is a button that brings up your contact list.
2007-04-04T11:33:00.000Z	arooni	adorablepuppy	is there anyway to have auto complete on any client?
2007-04-04T11:33:00.000Z	arooni		thunderbird etc...
2007-04-04T11:33:00.000Z	arooni		i live for that feature
2007-04-04T11:34:00.000Z	adorablepuppy	arooni	Dunno. I uninstalled my thunderbird. I use evolution. Though I only ever mail 3-4 people at a time.
2007-04-04T11:37:00.000Z	adorablepuppy	arooni	Acutally I'm wrong. It does have autocomplete.
2007-04-04T11:38:00.000Z	adorablepuppy	arooni	to people on your contact list.
2007-04-04T11:39:00.000Z	arooni	adorablepuppy	howd you do autocomplete
2007-04-04T11:39:00.000Z	arooni	adorablepuppy	whad you need to do... add a bunch of contacts?
2007-04-04T11:40:00.000Z	adorablepuppy	arooni	You must have the person in your contacts. I don't think it'll go by the people you have gotten mail from.
2007-04-04T11:41:00.000Z	arooni	adorablepuppy	another question... do you know how to make the reading pane to the right of recieved mail (instead of below it ) ?:
2007-04-04T11:42:00.000Z	adorablepuppy	arooni	I'm not entirely sure you can. . .

2007-04-04T11:46:00.000Z	adorablepuppy	arooni	You can also schedule tasks by clicking the time, then double clicking a day. If you use the calendar anyway.
2007-04-04T11:46:00.000Z	arooni	adorablepuppy	do you send email thru gmails smtp?
2007-04-04T11:47:00.000Z	adorablepuppy	arooni	No, I don't. I use my company's smtp. . .
