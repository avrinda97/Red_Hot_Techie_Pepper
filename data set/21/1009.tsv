2011-04-04T06:23:00.000Z	hachre		I have just installed 11.04 and my USB Audio Headset has got a very low volume, is this a well known problem? Anything I can do? All the sliders are on max already... <- solved by upping the volume via alsamixer.... this bug also existed in 10.10 and 10.04 im gonna report this now
2011-04-04T06:23:00.000Z	Polah	hachre	11.04 is in Beta. We will/cannot help you. Ask in #ubuntu+1
2011-04-04T06:24:00.000Z	hachre	Polah	Yeah, but it also affects 10.10 and 10.04
2011-04-04T06:24:00.000Z	Polah	hachre	Hardware issue then?
2011-04-04T06:25:00.000Z	hachre	Polah	thanks for the advice though
2011-04-04T06:25:00.000Z	hachre	Polah	its a standard usb audio device
2011-04-04T06:25:00.000Z	hachre	Polah	but no worries ill report this as a bug on launchpad in a sec

2011-04-04T06:26:00.000Z	Polah	hachre	Doesn't mean it isn't broken. Or your audio hardware for your PC
2011-04-04T06:27:00.000Z	hachre	Polah	it isn't broken.
2011-04-04T06:27:00.000Z	Polah	hachre	Does it work on anything before 10.04 or another operating system?
2011-04-04T06:27:00.000Z	hachre	Polah	there are people on ubuntuforums.org with this same issue and posts from early 2010
2011-04-04T06:27:00.000Z	hachre	Polah	it works on mac os and windows of course
2011-04-04T06:28:00.000Z	Polah	hachre	driver issue with Linux/Ubuntu then most likely
2011-04-04T06:28:00.000Z	hachre	Polah	the only problem is that the alsa volume is set to 1%
2011-04-04T06:28:00.000Z	hachre	Polah	and all the ui sliders in ubuntu dont handle the alsa volume
2011-04-04T06:29:00.000Z	hachre		polah: since many others have usb audio issus with different headsets I would guess it is like that for all usb audio devices
2011-04-04T06:29:00.000Z	Polah	hachre	Look for a command to increase volume?
2011-04-04T06:29:00.000Z	hachre	Polah	my original post stated that i have solved this
2011-04-04T06:29:00.000Z	hachre	Polah	I just posted it here because I asked it myself
2011-04-04T06:30:00.000Z	hachre	Polah	and I included the question with the answer, thats all
