2009-06-30T23:45:00.000Z	DoYouKnow		you set the ssid and other access point settings in iwconfig
2009-06-30T23:45:00.000Z	DoYouKnow		err
2009-06-30T23:45:00.000Z	DoYouKnow		*you set the ip address and netmask with ifconfig
2009-06-30T23:46:00.000Z	DoYouKnow		and the access point settings with iwconfig
2009-06-30T23:46:00.000Z	NamShub	DoYouKnow	But how can I list the essids?
2009-06-30T23:47:00.000Z	NamShub		(dont know it by heart)
2009-06-30T23:47:00.000Z	DoYouKnow		just make sure you bring the interface up with "ifconfig wlan0 up"
2009-06-30T23:47:00.000Z	DoYouKnow		then set the ip address and netmask
2009-06-30T23:47:00.000Z	DoYouKnow		and the gateway
2009-06-30T23:47:00.000Z	DoYouKnow		if you're not using dhcp
2009-06-30T23:49:00.000Z	NamShub	DoYouKnow	how I managed to start OpenBox is there a graphical tool I could use then? (I normally use Kubuntu Network Manager -- but KDE is broken right now I wanna connect so I can fix the install...)
2009-06-30T23:50:00.000Z	DoYouKnow	NamShub	hmm... you can try wicd.
2009-06-30T23:50:00.000Z	DoYouKnow	NamShub	sudo apt-get install wicd
2009-06-30T23:51:00.000Z	NamShub	DoYouKnow	apt-get would work great if my wifi would ;)
2009-06-30T23:53:00.000Z	DoYouKnow	NamShub	hmmm. I didn't think of that
2009-06-30T23:53:00.000Z	NamShub	DoYouKnow	well thanks for the help. I'll just wait until I can get a wired connection :S
2009-06-30T23:54:00.000Z	DoYouKnow	NamShub	so your only problem is that you can't configure your card?
2009-06-30T23:55:00.000Z	NamShub	DoYouKnow	I usually use KDE tools. It's broken right now so I want to connect using either openbox or the terminal so I can apt-get my broken / missing packages
