2007-10-22T11:40:00.000Z	zetheroo		hey .... all..... whats new?
2007-10-22T11:40:00.000Z	zetheroo		everyone still having problems with Gutsy?
2007-10-22T11:40:00.000Z	DARKGuy	zetheroo	not me :)
2007-10-22T11:41:00.000Z	zetheroo	DARKGuy	ahhhh... so there IS a success story....!!!
2007-10-22T11:43:00.000Z	DARKGuy	zetheroo	oh - well I can't bridge my wireless connection to eth0 so my laptop can connect through it XD but other than that... :p
2007-10-22T11:43:00.000Z	DARKGuy	zetheroo	ra0 and rausb0 were for realtek chipset cards, my D-Link used rausb1 :p
2007-10-22T11:43:00.000Z	zetheroo	DARKGuy	interesting...
2007-10-22T11:44:00.000Z	DARKGuy	zetheroo	it is - they changed to wlan0 now :)
2007-10-22T11:45:00.000Z	zetheroo	DARKGuy	what do you think about this?.... a friend of mine upgraded to Gusty from Feisty and now his wireless is completely unresponsive..... he can see all the available networks .... but beyond that nothing.... what do ya think?
2007-10-22T11:46:00.000Z	DARKGuy	zetheroo	huh :/ looks like a problem that's been in feisty too, there's a LOT of people with similar problems in the forum, there's even a thread with all of them piled up on it - I'd say it's not new :(
2007-10-22T11:46:00.000Z	zetheroo	DARKGuy	well its new for him.... was working swell in Feisty!?
2007-10-22T11:46:00.000Z	DARKGuy	zetheroo	besides, my D-Link card does the same thing XD
2007-10-22T11:47:00.000Z	DARKGuy	zetheroo	it could've been the upgrade, tried the livecd?
2007-10-22T11:47:00.000Z	zetheroo	DARKGuy	so we are looking at waiting now for bug fixes and the like?....
2007-10-22T11:47:00.000Z	zetheroo	DARKGuy	I thought thats what Beta releases are for!/
2007-10-22T11:48:00.000Z	DARKGuy	zetheroo	However not all the developers have the hardware everyone else has, it depends on the people who try the beta with their hardware and report the bugs they find - that also requires skill
2007-10-22T11:49:00.000Z	DARKGuy	zetheroo	your friend could try if he can connect using the LiveCD - that's like a "fresh install" with no upgraded system whatsoever, a bare, pure Gutsy - if it doesn't work then it'll mean it doesn't in Gutsy I'm afraid, but I'm no wireless guru
2007-10-22T11:49:00.000Z	zetheroo	DARKGuy	well I am hopeful that fixes will be out soon...
2007-10-22T11:50:00.000Z	DARKGuy	zetheroo	you and me too :(
2007-10-22T11:50:00.000Z	zetheroo	DARKGuy	ok... I'll get him to try that...
2007-10-22T11:50:00.000Z	DARKGuy	zetheroo	good luck =)
