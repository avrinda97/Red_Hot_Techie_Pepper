2008-04-24T22:27:00.000Z	dystopianray	BlueParrot	intel graphics does
2008-04-24T22:29:00.000Z	BlueParrot	dystopianray	how do I make it use the second screen to extend the desktop? at the moment it only wants to clone the output, even if I uncheck the "clone screen" box in resolution settings
2008-04-24T22:34:00.000Z	dystopianray	BlueParrot	I have dual monitor setup on my intel graphics right now
2008-04-24T22:34:00.000Z	dystopianray	BlueParrot	I set it up using xrandr on a terminal
2008-04-24T22:36:00.000Z	dystopianray	BlueParrot	try xrandr
2008-04-24T22:38:00.000Z	BlueParrot	dystopianray	it seems to claim i can't set a large enough display size
2008-04-24T22:38:00.000Z	BlueParrot	dystopianray	"user selected display size larger than maximum display size"
2008-04-24T22:38:00.000Z	dystopianray	BlueParrot	what does it say your maximum is?
2008-04-24T22:38:00.000Z	BlueParrot	dystopianray	same as the largest screen it seems
2008-04-24T22:38:00.000Z	dystopianray	BlueParrot	which is?
2008-04-24T22:39:00.000Z	dystopianray	BlueParrot	ah that's not good at all, at least on mine I'm doing 1680x1050, so I can do two 800x600 displays
2008-04-24T22:39:00.000Z	BlueParrot	dystopianray	"maximum 1280 x 1280"
2008-04-24T22:39:00.000Z	dystopianray	BlueParrot	driver limitation
2008-04-24T22:39:00.000Z	BlueParrot	dystopianray	oh
2008-04-24T22:40:00.000Z	BlueParrot	dystopianray	why does the drive limit it ?
2008-04-24T22:40:00.000Z	dystopianray	BlueParrot	no idea
