2007-03-20T12:41:00.000Z	pierc1		I am not really sure how the ubuntu releases work.  is edgy stuck with 2.6.17 forever now?
2007-03-20T12:43:00.000Z	pierc1		so then on april 19th then I will stop getting updates when new versions of the programs I use come out?  (im using feisty)
2007-03-20T12:44:00.000Z	Dabian	pierc1	: How can you you use feisty when it is yet to be released?
2007-03-20T12:45:00.000Z	pierc1	Dabian	I manually changed my sources.list, but as I understand it there is a more graphical nice way to do it now
2007-03-20T12:45:00.000Z	Dabian	pierc1	: Darn .. everything is getting graphical. ;D
2007-03-20T12:45:00.000Z	Dabian	pierc1	: Us ole boyz have a little trouble keeping up with all that fancy graphical stuff.  (At least some of us (me) does).
2007-03-20T12:47:00.000Z	pierc1	Dabian	you can install it, but you have to tweak some of the settings
2007-03-20T12:47:00.000Z	Dabian	pierc1	: Hmm .. I haven't got compiz working.
2007-03-20T12:48:00.000Z	pierc1	Dabian	for some reason ubuntu still influenced by some of the dirty old men that ran debian, and some of the code you need is less kosher, so they don't enable it by default
2007-03-20T12:49:00.000Z	Dabian	pierc1	: But we moved away from debian, just to escape those men, didn't we?
2007-03-20T12:50:00.000Z	Dabian	pierc1	: How is Intels (FOSS) gfx doing performance-wise?
2007-03-20T12:51:00.000Z	pierc1	Dabian	smooth.  on my macbook I notice far less choppyness than on my desktop which uses a geforce 4 nvidia card
2007-03-20T12:51:00.000Z	Dabian	pierc1	: GF4 is old.  But it is nice.
2007-03-20T13:02:00.000Z	Dabian	pierc1	: Maybe its my cpu
2007-03-20T13:03:00.000Z	Dabian	pierc1	: I dont have trouble wit video ... just dvds
2007-03-20T13:04:00.000Z	Dabian	pierc1	: And my trouble with dvds is not actual stops .. but more like a slowdown feeling.
2007-03-20T13:04:00.000Z	Dabian	pierc1	: Only occationally.
2007-03-20T13:57:00.000Z	Dabian	pierc1	: You might want to read this: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html
2007-03-20T13:58:00.000Z	Dabian	pierc1	: Not exactly the document I was searching for .. but it has some good insights still, IMHO.
2007-03-20T13:58:00.000Z	pierc1	Dabian	im actually pretty well read on the material :-p
2007-03-20T13:58:00.000Z	Dabian	pierc1	: And I posted on the wrong window :)
