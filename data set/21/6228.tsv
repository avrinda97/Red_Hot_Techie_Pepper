2007-05-06T14:01:00.000Z	Roor		im trying to install the nvidia drivers, but when i install them (and have nv be nvidia in xorg.conf) i reboot and get no screens found.. any ideas? using add/remove to install drivers on Feisty.
2007-05-06T14:02:00.000Z	catid	Roor	in a fresh Feisty install i was able to use nvidia drivers by simply clicking a checkbox in the restricted modules program
2007-05-06T14:02:00.000Z	catid	Roor	no xorg.conf changes required
2007-05-06T14:02:00.000Z	Roor	catid	ive done that aswell with the same results, no screens found
2007-05-06T14:03:00.000Z	Roor	catid	pretty sure when u enable restricted it changes the xorg
2007-05-06T14:03:00.000Z	catid	Roor	actually i was surprised to see that it doesn't edit xorg.conf
2007-05-06T14:03:00.000Z	Roor	catid	does your xorg.conf say "nv" or "nvidia" under device?
2007-05-06T14:03:00.000Z	catid	Roor	when i was using the restricted modules setup, no
2007-05-06T14:04:00.000Z	catid	Roor	i prefer my own kernel very much to the ubuntu one, so not anymore :)
2007-05-06T14:04:00.000Z	Roor	catid	can i see your xorg.conf?
2007-05-06T14:04:00.000Z	catid	Roor	okay, just a mom..
