2008-10-16T01:38:00.000Z	rab		having a problem with mysql-server-5.0 starting on boot by default, what init scripts should i be checking?
2008-10-16T01:39:00.000Z	joaopinto	rab	/etc/init.d/mysql ?
2008-10-16T01:39:00.000Z	rab	joaopinto	i run that manually with sudo /etc/init.d/mysql start and all is fine ... just doesnt happen on startup ... what calls that on startup (im looking for that line)?
2008-10-16T01:40:00.000Z	joaopinto	rab	have you checked /var/log/daemon.log ?
2008-10-16T01:43:00.000Z	rab	joaopinto	ah nice i see an error condition after doing a cat /var/log/daemon.log | grep mysql ... i get unable to bind to 3306
2008-10-16T01:43:00.000Z	joaopinto	rab	;)
2008-10-16T01:44:00.000Z	rab	joaopinto	the question is why tho what else would be bound to that tcp/ip port on a clean startup?
2008-10-16T01:44:00.000Z	joaopinto	rab	nothing
2008-10-16T01:45:00.000Z	rab	joaopinto	i mean i dont mind putting a call to /etc/init.d/mysql in /etc/rc.local but that just seems unclean
2008-10-16T01:47:00.000Z	joaopinto	rab	sudo fuser -n tcp 3306
2008-10-16T01:47:00.000Z	joaopinto	rab	starting mysql on rc.local is not a solution, you need to find what is binded to that port
2008-10-16T01:49:00.000Z	rab	joaopinto	the thing is nothing because if i run the script manually after clean boot it succeeds
2008-10-16T01:49:00.000Z	joaopinto	rab	that is something broken on your startup :P
2008-10-16T01:50:00.000Z	rab	joaopinto	i am binding to my nated ip address 192.168.1.101 ... maybe i dont have that address until after the first attempt happens?
2008-10-16T01:52:00.000Z	joaopinto	rab	that maybe the case
2008-10-16T01:53:00.000Z	joaopinto	rab	if the port was already in use you should get such error "already in use", so most likely the address is not yet available
2008-10-16T01:55:00.000Z	rab	joaopinto	so my fix is to stop using dhcp and maybe switch to static?
2008-10-16T01:57:00.000Z	joaopinto	rab	oh, mysql with dchp :P ?
2008-10-16T01:58:00.000Z	joaopinto	rab	that's a rare combination
2008-10-16T01:58:00.000Z	rab	joaopinto	well i have it setup so my dhcp server gives the same everytime but thats a hack
2008-10-16T01:58:00.000Z	rab	joaopinto	based on MAC requesting the dhcp address from dhcpd
