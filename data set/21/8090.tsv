2006-06-02T10:27:00.000Z	Nothus		Anyone know the Xsession scripts well enough to tell me why FVWM can't start from gdm?!?
2006-06-02T10:28:00.000Z	farous	Nothus	does it have an entry in /usr/share/xsessions?
2006-06-02T10:28:00.000Z	Nothus	farous	Yes
2006-06-02T10:29:00.000Z	Nothus	farous	By the way, this was working until I did an apt-get dist upgrade from Breezy to Dapper this morning :-)
2006-06-02T10:29:00.000Z	farous	Nothus	try to find if the .desktop entry point to the write executable. that is all i can think of
2006-06-02T10:29:00.000Z	farous	Nothus	the executable might have been erased and you need to install the dapper package
2006-06-02T10:30:00.000Z	farous	Nothus	i had a similar problem Nothus
2006-06-02T11:30:00.000Z	farous	Nothus	what is the problem can not you start gnome
2006-06-02T11:30:00.000Z	Nothus	farous	Starting gnome or fvwm comes up with the same error..
2006-06-02T11:31:00.000Z	farous	Nothus	did you look at gdm.conf
2006-06-02T11:31:00.000Z	farous	Nothus	what is the error by the way
2006-06-02T11:31:00.000Z	Nothus	farous	.xsession-errors: stty: standard input: Inappropriate ioctl for device
2006-06-02T11:33:00.000Z	Nothus	farous	From the upgrade? It wasn't one of the things I was asked to keep, so I assume it installed a new one?
2006-06-02T11:34:00.000Z	farous	Nothus	it is a serial dev not sure what is it. but you can install kdm or xdm though i doubt gdm is the problem
2006-06-02T11:34:00.000Z	Nothus	farous	I kept the old version of gdm.conf cos I have it setup to allow remote XDMP
2006-06-02T11:35:00.000Z	farous	Nothus	you can just change that later. keep your old file under another name for ref
2006-06-02T11:35:00.000Z	Nothus	farous	Yeah, I think there's something being called, but I can't tell what, cos I can start X manually and it works..
2006-06-02T11:35:00.000Z	farous	Nothus	i am not sure if they changed anything in it though
2006-06-02T11:36:00.000Z	Nothus	farous	Cool, I'll have to give that a bash later.. Need to go now.. Work is having a social
2006-06-02T11:36:00.000Z	Nothus	farous	Thanks :-)
2006-06-02T11:36:00.000Z	farous	Nothus	enabling xdmp is not that hard :) srore it as gdm.conf-old and reinstall the new one
