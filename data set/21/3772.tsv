2008-09-26T01:19:00.000Z	jim_p	tpg	remove every tool on the toolbar and re-add it

2008-09-26T01:25:00.000Z	tpg	jim_p	it seems like editing the toolbar doesnt really work, i have found 2 errors though in the error console
2008-09-26T01:26:00.000Z	tpg	jim_p	3 errors auctully now
2008-09-26T01:26:00.000Z	jim_p	tpg	i dont know then. the error console i think shows errors related to pages, like some css fault
2008-09-26T01:27:00.000Z	tpg	jim_p	ok thanks for your assistance, do you happen to know any way reinstall Firefox or?
2008-09-26T01:29:00.000Z	jim_p	tpg	remove it >> sudo apt-get remove firefox --purge, delete a folder inside your /home named .mozilla and averything will return to 0. install after that
2008-09-26T01:30:00.000Z	tpg	jim_p	thanks alot, its fixed now :)
2008-09-26T01:31:00.000Z	jim_p	tpg	:) you are welcome
2008-09-26T01:34:00.000Z	tpg	jim_p	I also have a issue here, with Openbox that is, when i try to change something at obmenu(which i downloaded) it doesnt want to save or cant save..
2008-09-26T01:35:00.000Z	jim_p	tpg	there is some command that reloads the openbox (the wm and the menu). i dont remember it right now :(
2008-09-26T01:35:00.000Z	jim_p	tpg	after you are done with editing, you need to reload the menus
2008-09-26T01:36:00.000Z	tpg	jim_p	ok, im going to look into that on the internet, thankyou :)
2008-09-26T01:37:00.000Z	jim_p	tpg	you are welcome again
2008-09-26T01:43:00.000Z	tpg	jim_p	i found it out, i just have to be root when i save, saw in the terminal when i opened OBMENU with it that it said the permission was denied, so..
2008-09-26T01:44:00.000Z	jim_p	tpg	lol
