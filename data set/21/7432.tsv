2006-10-01T12:19:00.000Z	RAMiN		heck yes
2006-10-01T12:20:00.000Z	RAMiN		sure
2006-10-01T12:20:00.000Z	RAMiN		is my name cool?
2006-10-01T12:20:00.000Z	RAMiN		okay
2006-10-01T12:21:00.000Z	RAMiN		but sometimes, it gives me errors that is why I came here
2006-10-01T12:21:00.000Z	RAMiN		okay, now, I let it do everything automatically
2006-10-01T12:21:00.000Z	RAMiN		lets see what it does
2006-10-01T12:22:00.000Z	RAMiN		stuck on 15% percent
2006-10-01T12:22:00.000Z	RAMiN		failed to create a system file
2006-10-01T12:22:00.000Z	RAMiN		failed to create a file system
2006-10-01T12:22:00.000Z	asmandeus	RAMiN	ah that LiveCD problem
2006-10-01T12:23:00.000Z	asmandeus	RAMiN	yeah
2006-10-01T12:27:00.000Z	asmandeus	RAMiN	if you have a windows CD, try booting into that and ripping those linux partitions apart - putting them into FAT and then trying the liveCD again
2006-10-01T12:28:00.000Z	asmandeus	RAMiN	I think there is a bug on the LiveCD that causes the error you're getting
2006-10-01T12:28:00.000Z	asmandeus	RAMiN	and that was my work around
2006-10-01T12:29:00.000Z	asmandeus	RAMiN	It seems to be some kinda bug that when you try to install onto an already made partition by the LiveCD, it comes up with the locking at 15% and that error
2006-10-01T12:30:00.000Z	asmandeus	RAMiN	I'm not sure why it'd have trouble installing into the correct file system like that
2006-10-01T12:30:00.000Z	asmandeus	RAMiN	but for some reason that seemed to cause the problem you're having (and I had)
2006-10-01T12:30:00.000Z	asmandeus	RAMiN	I dunno
2006-10-01T12:32:00.000Z	asmandeus	RAMiN	See, with my limited knowledge of troubleshooting, the best way I could come up with fixing this was to put things sorta back the way I had them - basically putting hda1 as FAT, before I partitioned it with the liveCD
2006-10-01T12:36:00.000Z	asmandeus	RAMiN	I think variant has the right idea, I'm just too much of a newbie - instead relying on a windows disc to repartition crap
