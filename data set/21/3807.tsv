2008-09-16T08:20:00.000Z	gbear14275		hey guys, I'm getting LBA and CHS mismatch errors after I partition my dual boot setup and when I rewrite the MBR using testdisk it skips my grub bootloader and boots right to windows...
2008-09-16T08:20:00.000Z	gbear14275		any ideas or anyone come across this problem before?
2008-09-16T08:21:00.000Z	gbear14275		daklan... newcomer to bittorrent huh?
2008-09-16T08:22:00.000Z	gbear14275		what do you consider  "features"?
2008-09-16T08:22:00.000Z	gbear14275		torrents are slow?  compared to what kelvin?
2008-09-16T08:24:00.000Z	gbear14275		well if you can find everything on rapidshare at 1250kbps then i'd go for it then
2008-09-16T08:25:00.000Z	gbear14275		ok, so having problems getting a dualboot online after partitioning... anyone have any dualboot experience in here?
2008-09-16T08:26:00.000Z	bazhang	gbear14275	did you install xp second
2008-09-16T08:26:00.000Z	bazhang	gbear14275	what is the exact prob then
2009-01-02T13:46:00.000Z	gbear14275	bazhang	how do i kill a process?  transmissions window went grey and wont quit
2009-01-09T12:25:00.000Z	bazhang	gbear14275	package for redhat fedora suse and the like; debian ubuntu use .deb packages
2010-07-24T10:56:00.000Z	bazhang	gbear14275	ignore him please
2010-07-24T10:56:00.000Z	gbear14275	bazhang	i can do that
2011-01-18T09:55:00.000Z	bazhang	gbear14275	they are the same under the hood. try 10.10
2011-01-18T09:56:00.000Z	gbear14275	bazhang	what about lubuntu?
2011-01-18T09:56:00.000Z	bazhang	gbear14275	low end, sure (less ram slower cpu)
2011-01-18T09:57:00.000Z	gbear14275	bazhang	the lubuntu installer has failed on a few different attempts
2011-01-18T09:57:00.000Z	bazhang	gbear14275	there's a lubuntu iso?
2011-01-18T09:58:00.000Z	gbear14275	bazhang	yeah, but it's not officially canonical
2011-01-18T09:59:00.000Z	bazhang	gbear14275	then install whichever, and run either !puregnome or !purekde !pure xfce and install lubuntu-desktop
2011-01-18T09:59:00.000Z	gbear14275	bazhang	ah, ok good point
