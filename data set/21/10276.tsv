2005-04-16T07:11:00.000Z	whiskers		wow this is really confusing
2005-04-16T07:12:00.000Z	whiskers		oo2 requires gcc4 and when you go to try to compile with gcc4 freemat requires g77 and g77 3.4 requires gcc 3.4
2005-04-16T07:12:00.000Z	whiskers		this is very confusing
2005-04-16T07:12:00.000Z	roo_	whiskers	you're compiling oo2 from source?
2005-04-16T07:12:00.000Z	whiskers	roo_	no i installed oo2 and it required gcc4 for some reason
2005-04-16T07:13:00.000Z	roo_	whiskers	hmm, im not getting that dep..
2005-04-16T07:15:00.000Z	roo_	whiskers	gcc4 is still unstable..
2005-04-16T07:16:00.000Z	roo_	whiskers	no, i wouldnt advice symlinking anything to do with gcc. you'll bork your toolchain most likely.
2005-04-16T07:16:00.000Z	whiskers	roo_	well i need to compile freemat
2005-04-16T07:31:00.000Z	roo_	whiskers	use gentoo, THEN complain about compile times :p
2005-04-16T07:31:00.000Z	whiskers	roo_	no...my hard disk is too small for gentoo
2005-04-16T07:32:00.000Z	whiskers	roo_	 i don't like the wd1200 ..it did not even last 1 year
2005-04-16T07:32:00.000Z	whiskers	roo_	so i am trying a wd 40gig
2005-04-16T07:32:00.000Z	whiskers	roo_	and it is too small for gentoo
2005-04-16T07:32:00.000Z	roo_	whiskers	wtf? i have a 3gb parition with gentoo on it.
2005-04-16T07:33:00.000Z	whiskers	roo_	hah...my wd1200 had 120gigs and i was already up to 80  gigs before the head crashed
2005-04-16T07:33:00.000Z	whiskers	roo_	and this is only a 40 gig
2005-04-16T07:34:00.000Z	roo_	whiskers	erm, ok. im telling u, 3gb is enough for gentoo unless u did something VERY wrong
2005-04-16T07:34:00.000Z	whiskers	roo_	and i don't need all that gentoo stuff
2005-04-16T07:34:00.000Z	whiskers	roo_	i am only going to put the ubuntu basics on this hoary
2005-04-16T07:34:00.000Z	roo_	whiskers	you could do that with gentoo, but whatever.
