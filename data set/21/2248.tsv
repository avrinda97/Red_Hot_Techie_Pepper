2011-07-28T06:19:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender		hello all.  Running 11.04 x64 and having Flash player freezes in Chromium & Firefox pretty much equally.  Firefox used to survive a little longer but now both cap out at about 1 minute of playback and then simply stops dead.  what is the current best solution for this?
2011-07-28T06:20:00.000Z	mgj	[TK]D-Fender	are you using gnash? Or adobe flash?
2011-07-28T06:21:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender	mgj	FAIK adobe
2011-07-28T06:22:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender	mgj	Indeed no gnash, just Adobe Flash Player 1http://watch.thecomedynetwork.ca/#clip506157
2011-07-28T06:22:00.000Z	mgj	[TK]D-Fender	beats me then. Gnash is the open alternative, but its not quite there yet.
2011-07-28T06:22:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender		10.3.181.34ubuntu0.11.04.1 (flashplugin-installer)
2011-07-28T06:22:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender		darn paste buffer fail
2011-07-28T06:22:00.000Z	mgj		thought that if you were using gnash, you could try adobe
2011-07-28T06:23:00.000Z	mgj		unfortunately it seems like you just have to wait a few years for flash to become obsolete. Will happen soon enough
2011-07-28T06:23:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender	mgj	That's Apple's Kool-Aid :p
2011-07-28T06:23:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender	mgj	And I ain't drinking it :p
2011-07-28T06:23:00.000Z	mgj		dont care
2011-07-28T06:23:00.000Z	mgj		it doesnt work, never did
2011-07-28T06:23:00.000Z	mgj		and now we have better alternatives to it
2011-07-28T06:24:00.000Z	mgj		so it will die
2011-07-28T06:24:00.000Z	mgj		finally
2011-07-28T06:24:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender		Actually is used to work.... just recently... was a shaky start to 11.04 but previous releases worked fine...
2011-07-28T06:24:00.000Z	mgj		Flash has never worked, on any platform
2011-07-28T06:24:00.000Z	mgj		not really
2011-07-28T06:25:00.000Z	[TK]D-Fender	mgj	Sure I've had minor issues on other platforms, but that's once in a blue moon material.  This is jsut DOA
2011-07-28T06:25:00.000Z	mgj	[TK]D-Fender	people have different defitions of "it works". For me, flash never worked. Ever. Windows, linux, 1995 or 2011, never worked
