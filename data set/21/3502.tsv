2010-07-24T17:58:00.000Z	feltham83		When i try to logon use SESSION gnome it goes for about 10 secs then logs back out. I can login using FAILSAFE gnome, any ideas?
2010-07-24T17:59:00.000Z	Muelli	feltham83	hm. weird. can you log in to your failsafe session, open a terminal (Alt+F2, then "gnome-terminal"), do a "cat ~/.xsession-errors" and paste that using pastebin.com or so?
2010-07-24T18:01:00.000Z	feltham83	Muelli	- were do i paste it???
2010-07-24T18:02:00.000Z	feltham83	Muelli	- i done the cat command
2010-07-24T18:06:00.000Z	feltham83	Muelli	- try http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/QWjVwZXP
2010-07-24T18:06:00.000Z	Muelli	feltham83	nice. can you do the same with "dmesg", too?
2010-07-24T18:07:00.000Z	feltham83	Muelli	- how i do that lol
2010-07-24T18:07:00.000Z	Muelli	feltham83	type "dmesg" into the temrinal and paste it, as you did with the xsession-errors.
2010-07-24T18:10:00.000Z	Muelli	feltham83	i.e. "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade" on your  terminal.
2010-07-24T18:11:00.000Z	feltham83	Muelli	- by the looks of things no as their is 240 to install, only installed  it today
2010-07-24T18:12:00.000Z	Muelli	feltham83	there you go. So update your stuff, reboot, and try again :-)
2010-07-24T18:12:00.000Z	feltham83	Muelli	- ok i will try that, it worked fine on my previous computer but not this one
2010-07-24T19:07:00.000Z	feltham83	Muelli	- you here?
2010-07-24T19:12:00.000Z	Muelli	feltham83	hm. yes. kinda
2010-07-24T19:12:00.000Z	feltham83	Muelli	- i updated but still same problem
2010-07-24T19:13:00.000Z	Muelli	feltham83	hm. weird. again: login failsafe, paste .xsession-errors and dmesg.

2010-07-24T19:17:00.000Z	feltham83	Muelli	0 http://pastebin.com/jyYyB6jf (dmesg)
2010-07-24T19:18:00.000Z	feltham83	Muelli	- http://pastebin.com/04FVq33t (dmesg from gnome-session-log)
2010-07-24T19:20:00.000Z	feltham83	Muelli	- i resubmitted the dmesg log (http://pastebin.com/04FVq33t) here this doesn't show the flood
2010-07-24T19:20:00.000Z	Muelli	feltham83	yes, because it's incomplete.
