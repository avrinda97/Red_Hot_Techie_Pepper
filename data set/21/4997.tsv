2008-01-17T03:49:00.000Z	yoni_ub		does someoene can give me some tricks to resolve my dns problem ?
2008-01-17T03:49:00.000Z	MrObvious	yoni_ub	Explain your DNS problem.
2008-01-17T03:51:00.000Z	MrObvious	yoni_ub	So basically you're making your own DNS server locally?
2008-01-17T03:51:00.000Z	MrObvious	yoni_ub	Can I ask why? I might be able to suggest a less involved solution.
2008-01-17T03:54:00.000Z	MrObvious	yoni_ub	Hmm, you mean your ISP has bad DNS serv.ers? I set my DNS to 4.2.2.1, 4.2.2.2, and 4.2.2.3 because my ISP's DNS servers where having hiccups lately
2008-01-17T03:55:00.000Z	yoni_ub	MrObvious	I plan to have several website on it and to manage mails using gmail
2008-01-17T03:55:00.000Z	yoni_ub	MrObvious	It's to configure the dns for the domain aladyo.be
2008-01-17T03:56:00.000Z	MrObvious	yoni_ub	Ohh I see what you're doing. I got confused sorry.
2008-01-17T03:56:00.000Z	MrObvious	yoni_ub	So you're trying to get a domain (aladyo.be) to your IP address then?
2008-01-17T03:56:00.000Z	yoni_ub	MrObvious	Yes, that right!
2008-01-17T03:57:00.000Z	yoni_ub	MrObvious	The domain is already forwarding to this IP
2008-01-17T03:57:00.000Z	yoni_ub	MrObvious	The domain is already forwarding to this fixed IP
2008-01-17T03:58:00.000Z	MrObvious	yoni_ub	Yeah I understand. So if I were to ping the domain it would ping your IP?
2008-01-17T03:58:00.000Z	yoni_ub	MrObvious	Yes but right now, he doesn't succeed to resolve the aladyo.Be domain, because dns are not set correctly on the ubuntu server
2008-01-17T03:59:00.000Z	MrObvious	yoni_ub	Hmm. There's gotta be a better solution. Who is providing the domain?
2008-01-17T04:01:00.000Z	MrObvious	yoni_ub	Sorry I guess I misunderstood the problem initially. What I would suggest is going to no-ip.com and setting up a subdomain there and setting it to point to your IP, then setting your domain to point to your subdomain there.
2008-01-17T04:01:00.000Z	MrObvious	yoni_ub	I have it set up at entercomm.no-ip.biz forwarding to my IP address now, and if I wanted a domain all I'd do is point it to that no-ip.biz address since they update their servers within 5 minutes.
2008-01-17T04:02:00.000Z	MrObvious	yoni_ub	Ok, I guess I've helped as much as I can. Sorry I can't do more but it's worth looking into (even with a static IP) as it would seem simpler to me.
2008-01-17T04:04:00.000Z	MrObvious	yoni_ub	What I did was sign up for an account there, add a record, set the IP address to my broadband connection here at work and no-ip.com automatically updates it once you set itup.
2008-01-17T04:05:00.000Z	MrObvious	yoni_ub	Nope. no-ip set up DNS. You can even ping that address and it will go to my router as it's set up correctly. No need for having a local DNS server at all.
2008-01-17T04:06:00.000Z	MrObvious	yoni_ub	You're welcome. I hope that makes things simple for you. :)
