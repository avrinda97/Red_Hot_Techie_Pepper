2008-05-17T12:02:00.000Z	pat5star	yoandy	sry I missed your convo about your broadcom card, what were you asking? I have the same card
2008-05-17T12:03:00.000Z	yoandy	pat5star	i ask if there were any plan to backport 2.6.25 on hardy to fix curretn problrm with bcm94311rev02 and 2.6.24 kernel
2008-05-17T12:04:00.000Z	yoandy	pat5star	or any other solution to get 4311rev02 working
2008-05-17T12:04:00.000Z	pat5star	yoandy	oh ok...that would be nice. I had to jump through hoops to get mine working but it is, would be much nicer if it just worked out of the box :)
2008-05-17T12:05:00.000Z	yoandy	pat5star	how did you get it working? through ndiswrapper? or?
2008-05-17T12:05:00.000Z	pat5star	yoandy	yes, ndiswrapper was the only way
2008-05-17T12:06:00.000Z	pat5star	yoandy	if you want, I can dig up the guide I used to get it working, would take me a sec (not on my laptop right now where I have it all saved)
2008-05-17T12:07:00.000Z	yoandy	pat5star	well, if its not to much trouble, plz!
2008-05-17T12:08:00.000Z	pat5star	yoandy	sure no problem, just one minute
2008-05-17T12:22:00.000Z	pat5star	yoandy	I'm sorry, I can't find the link. Since I'm upgraded to firefox 3 and google sync no longer works, I don't have it bookmarked on this computer. I don't have access to my laptop right now...really sorry :(
2008-05-17T12:22:00.000Z	pat5star	yoandy	I remember it was a pain, and the trick ended up being something I had to add to my rc.local script but I can't remember exactly what it was off the top of my head
2008-05-17T12:23:00.000Z	yoandy	pat5star	dont worry, thanks any way,
2008-05-17T12:24:00.000Z	pat5star	yoandy	really wish I had my laptop now. I'd love to save anyone the time and frustration I went through in order to get mine working!
2008-05-17T12:28:00.000Z	pat5star	yoandy	you still here?
2008-05-17T12:28:00.000Z	yoandy	pat5star	sep
2008-05-17T12:29:00.000Z	pat5star	yoandy	I just remembered, one thing that made it work and I don't know why, was to add this to rc.local: rmmod ssb; rmmod ndiswrapper; modprobe ndiswrapper...
2008-05-17T12:30:00.000Z	pat5star	yoandy	obv you can put those 3 commands on sep lines. but those commands allowed my wireless to startup on boot. if you run those from a shell on your laptop now just to check, it should work
2008-05-17T12:31:00.000Z	yoandy	pat5star	i had read that its necessary because a bug in the order the modules are loaded (ssb and ndis..) or anything like that :)
2008-05-17T12:32:00.000Z	pat5star	yoandy	right...cause I wasted a lot of time until I got that part, then it's been working great for me since
2008-05-17T12:33:00.000Z	yoandy	pat5star	thanks, i will try ndiswrapper tomorrow its 3:00 am here, my head can beat ndiswrapper right now :)
2008-05-17T12:33:00.000Z	pat5star	yoandy	lol, well good luck :)
