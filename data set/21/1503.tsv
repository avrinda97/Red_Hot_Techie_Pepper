2010-08-17T21:09:00.000Z	tatofoo		hello, I want to find out an IP from a computer name, I've used nslookup but it's not working since my DNS server isn't telling me the IP, how else can I do it? or do I have to setup my own DNS somewhere?
2010-08-17T21:09:00.000Z	acarr	tatofoo	fyi
2010-08-17T21:10:00.000Z	acarr	tatofoo	 normally, the ping command will resolve an ip address from a domain name.
2010-08-17T21:12:00.000Z	acarr	tatofoo	 If you are trying to ping a system on your own network with a computer name of "computer01" you will either need a hosts entry in your /etc/hosts file or the ip address / mac address to contact the device....
2010-08-17T21:13:00.000Z	tatofoo	acarr	MAC address :O! can I specify it in /etc/hosts instead of the IP?
2010-08-17T21:15:00.000Z	acarr	tatofoo	 o
2010-08-17T21:15:00.000Z	acarr	tatofoo	no
2010-08-17T21:15:00.000Z	acarr	tatofoo	Do you have the mac address of the machine you are trying to reach?
2010-08-17T21:16:00.000Z	acarr	tatofoo	also, is the machine on the same subnet as the machine you are trying to reach it from, or, do you have a static route setup if it is not?
2010-08-17T21:16:00.000Z	tatofoo	acarr	yes, I use it already for wake on LAN, can I get the IP from it?
2010-08-17T21:16:00.000Z	tatofoo	acarr	same subnet
2010-08-17T21:16:00.000Z	acarr	tatofoo	dhcp?
2010-08-17T21:16:00.000Z	acarr	tatofoo	or static ips
2010-08-17T21:16:00.000Z	tatofoo	acarr	dhcp, static is not an option
2010-08-17T21:17:00.000Z	acarr	tatofoo	what is the ip of the machine you are on?
2010-08-17T21:17:00.000Z	tatofoo	acarr	10.0.18.82 and the other is 10.0.18.78
2010-08-17T21:18:00.000Z	acarr	tatofoo	but you dont know the ip of "computer01"
2010-08-17T21:19:00.000Z	tatofoo	acarr	right now I know because I looked at it, but let's say, I shut them down and power them tomorrow (asumming there is not only one machine but 50 now) I won't know the IP of all of them, so that's why I was asking the NAME -> IP thing
2010-08-17T21:21:00.000Z	acarr	tatofoo	you can pole your dhcp server
2010-08-17T21:21:00.000Z	acarr	tatofoo	is it your dhcp server?
2010-08-17T21:22:00.000Z	tatofoo	acarr	:O how would I do that?
