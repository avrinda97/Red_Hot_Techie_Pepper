2007-05-29T06:22:00.000Z	danielDOM		Does anyone else have a problem opening .zip files in ubuntu ? ...
2007-05-29T06:23:00.000Z	danielDOM		well i've downloaded several different .zip files and i cant open a single one. Is ARK the only program available for opening .zip files? :\
2007-05-29T06:24:00.000Z	danielDOM		unzip:  cannot find zipfile directory in one of WoW-2.0.0-enUS-Installer.zip or
2007-05-29T06:24:00.000Z	danielDOM		        WoW-2.0.0-enUS-Installer.zip.zip, and cannot find WoW-2.0.0-enUS-Install

2007-05-29T06:24:00.000Z	predaeus	danielDOM	do a "file filename" on your zip files to see what file type they are
2007-05-29T06:24:00.000Z	danielDOM	Tom47	i use KDE
2007-05-29T06:25:00.000Z	predaeus		"file" will tell
2007-05-29T06:25:00.000Z	danielDOM		WoW-2.0.0-enUS-Installer.zip: 7-zip archive data, version 0.2
2007-05-29T06:27:00.000Z	danielDOM		Predaeus, any ideas? :\
2007-05-29T06:28:00.000Z	predaeus	danielDOM	not sure if file roller or the kde equivalent should handle this by default, else try  package      p7zip-full - 7-Zip is a file archiver with high compression ratio    might be able to unzip this aswell
2007-05-29T06:29:00.000Z	danielDOM		Predaeus, p7zip = a program ? sorry im kinda new to all this
2007-05-29T06:29:00.000Z	predaeus	danielDOM	it is a package not sure what the program inside is called.
2007-05-29T06:30:00.000Z	danielDOM		Predaeus i have the package now via apt-get, how do i specify that program to open it rather than "unzip" ?
2007-05-29T06:30:00.000Z	predaeus	danielDOM	open the Add/remove application and search for p7zip and install it then look for an application entry or try    p7<tab>  in a console to see to what application name it completes, then do "man applicationname" to see how you need to use it.
2007-05-29T06:32:00.000Z	danielDOM		7z -e <filename> look about right ?
2007-05-29T06:33:00.000Z	predaeus	danielDOM	if -e means extract it is probably right yes
2007-05-29T06:33:00.000Z	predaeus	danielDOM	I did not read the manpages though.
