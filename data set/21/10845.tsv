2005-01-01T07:19:00.000Z	AndyFit1	usual	I'm checking what happened to it ..    brisgeek is a debian box  . never lets me down.    fitzsimon.com.au is a win2k box ( I only use it for the storage space )  its constantly flaky
2005-01-01T07:20:00.000Z	AndyFit1	usual	 it went missing ... weird ..  its up now

2005-01-01T07:29:00.000Z	usual	AndyFit1	I see a bunch or templates but nowhere to custom tell it to do 128x128
2005-01-01T07:31:00.000Z	usual	AndyFit1	do I have to do something special to perfectly paste the icon into the new doc? or do I just drag it over it and hope for the best
2005-01-01T07:31:00.000Z	usual	AndyFit1	did you install the multimedia packages like libdvdcss2 or whatever
2005-01-01T07:32:00.000Z	AndyFit1	usual	those bugs were fixed when I visited the inkscape dev team in melbourne :)
2005-01-01T07:33:00.000Z	AndyFit1	usual	yeah I installed everything needed.  and I didnt uninstall anything .  the same files that played a few days ago won't play now  with no corruption etc
