2005-11-18T12:53:00.000Z	CORONA		anyone knows what is the best thing to do when you have a complete system freeze- no mouse, keyboard...is it a reboot?
2005-11-18T12:53:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	CORONA	its time to scream if you ever see something like this in ubuntu
2005-11-18T12:54:00.000Z	CORONA	wickedpuppy	it happens quite a bit to me ;)
2005-11-18T12:55:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	CORONA	then check ya /var/log ....your hardware got big problem ... apps crash .. for kernel itself to freeze is another thing
2005-11-18T12:55:00.000Z	CORONA	wickedpuppy	i have lot of crashes on kde apps
2005-11-18T12:56:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	CORONA	app crashes all the time ... but you said the whole OS froze
2005-11-18T12:56:00.000Z	CORONA	wickedpuppy	ya first its the apps then the whole system freezes
2005-11-18T12:57:00.000Z	CORONA	wickedpuppy	which log file should i look at
2005-11-18T12:57:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	CORONA	then its just more than apps crashing .. check ya /var/log/message
2005-11-18T12:57:00.000Z	CORONA	wickedpuppy	ok
2005-11-18T13:02:00.000Z	CORONA	wickedpuppy	if an app like amarok crashed would it be logged in /var/log/messages
2005-11-18T13:02:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	CORONA	yes
2005-11-18T13:05:00.000Z	CORONA	wickedpuppy	it looks ok to me-the messages log. but there are a lot of entries like this one Nov 13 11:32:56 bigbillcotton kernel: [4295159.494000]  atkbd.c: Unknown key released (translated set 2, code 0xaa on isa0060/serio0).

2005-11-18T13:24:00.000Z	CORONA	wickedpuppy	thanks for the help, i dont think amarok is logging anything into messages. cause i just switched it on and it does not appear in my system tray. it has been doing this for a while
2005-11-18T13:24:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	CORONA	no problem .. btw can your nick be in small letters ?
2005-11-18T13:25:00.000Z	CORONA	wickedpuppy	do i have to do a set nick for that?
