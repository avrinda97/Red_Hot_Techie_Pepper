2010-04-25T10:15:00.000Z	itilious		when im trying to run this command: tar xvfz xampp-linux-1.7.3a.tar.gz -C /opt
2010-04-25T10:15:00.000Z	itilious		i'm getting this error http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/422041/
2010-04-25T10:15:00.000Z	itilious		why can't i extract this in ubuntu 9.1 x64?
2010-04-25T10:16:00.000Z	rww	itilious	because that command has both -x for extract and -c for create new archive, which is nonsensical.
2010-04-25T10:17:00.000Z	rww	itilious	if you're trying to extract that tar.gz, remove the -c /opt off the end
2010-04-25T10:19:00.000Z	itilious	rww	now i'm getting this error after removing the "-c /opt" http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/422043/
2010-04-25T10:20:00.000Z	rww	itilious	you're not on the desktop. Like ubottu said, we don't support xampp installs.
2010-04-25T10:21:00.000Z	rww	itilious	the webpage probably meant -C instead of -c
2010-04-25T10:21:00.000Z	itilious	rww	ha ha i actually just did that too when installing the ubuntu guest OS additions
2011-04-22T09:04:00.000Z	rww	itilious	not really. that would give apache2 (or your httpd in general) sudo permissions, which would be an issue if someone exploited a vulnerability in apache2.
2011-04-22T09:05:00.000Z	itilious	rww	so is that not the way to use ssh/sftp? cuz a few guides i found said to do that, but it seemed like a security risk
2011-04-22T09:05:00.000Z	rww	itilious	It is a security risk. I use ssh, sftp, and apache2, and am not sure why you'd want to do that :\
2011-04-22T09:06:00.000Z	itilious	rww	do you not use a user specifically for /var/www access?
2011-04-22T09:08:00.000Z	rww	itilious	I added my user account to the www-data group.
2011-04-22T09:08:00.000Z	rww	itilious	which is probably not ideal either, but at least then you're not giving sudo access to a public-facing daemon
2011-04-22T09:18:00.000Z	rww	itilious	SFTP is not SSH + FTP.
2011-04-22T09:19:00.000Z	itilious	rww	when i use filezilla and choose, sftp -ssh it connects fine for my main user, and i'm guesing this is secure right?
2011-04-22T09:19:00.000Z	rww	itilious	sftp is a protocol provided by openssh-server that has nothing to do with your FTP server.
2011-04-22T09:19:00.000Z	rww	itilious	and yes, sftp is secure
2011-04-22T09:20:00.000Z	itilious	rww	from what i've learnd ftp goes thru the ssh tunnel, hence the traffic is secure right?
2011-04-22T09:20:00.000Z	rww	itilious	I just said SFTP is secure. SFTP is not FTP through an SSH tunnel, it's an entirely separate protocol from FTP.
