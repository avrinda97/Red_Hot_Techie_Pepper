2011-09-12T11:32:00.000Z	jasonmsp		rm -r on what I thought was just the folder that linked to /dev/sdb3
2011-09-12T11:33:00.000Z	lws	jasonmsp	oh dammmn.
2011-09-12T11:33:00.000Z	lws	jasonmsp	keep that partition unmounted, and try 'foremost' to recover any important files
2011-09-12T11:34:00.000Z	lws	jasonmsp	there's also apparently and 'extundelete' tool which undeletes files from ext3/ext4
2011-09-12T11:35:00.000Z	lws	jasonmsp	cool
2011-09-12T11:35:00.000Z	lws	jasonmsp	first thing you want to do is remount read-only, to avoid trashing anything by writing to the disk
2011-09-12T11:36:00.000Z	lws	jasonmsp	kai +1
2011-09-12T11:41:00.000Z	lws	jasonmsp	actually, sleeping on it may be a good idea ;)
2011-09-12T11:41:00.000Z	lws	jasonmsp	heh, what timezone are you in?
2011-09-12T11:46:00.000Z	lws	jasonmsp	sudo umount /media/help
2011-09-12T11:47:00.000Z	lws	jasonmsp	then try sudo umount /dev/sdb3
2011-09-12T11:49:00.000Z	jasonmsp	lws	got rid of them all.  left me with an empty drive
2011-09-12T11:50:00.000Z	jasonmsp	lws	it would be good if I could get everything
2011-09-12T11:53:00.000Z	lws	jasonmsp	recommend you try extundelete first
2011-09-12T12:02:00.000Z	lws	jasonmsp	sudo aptitude install build-essential
2011-09-12T12:02:00.000Z	lws	jasonmsp	that should install you a compiler and a make tool
2011-09-12T12:37:00.000Z	lws	jasonmsp	you recovere everything?
2011-09-12T12:38:00.000Z	lws	jasonmsp	which route did you take, extundelete or foremost?
2011-09-12T12:39:00.000Z	lws	jasonmsp	a winner is you!
2011-09-12T12:39:00.000Z	lws	jasonmsp	i'll have to keep extundelete close to hand
2011-09-12T12:45:00.000Z	jasonmsp	lws	 thanks again.
