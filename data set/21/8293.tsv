2007-04-26T09:56:00.000Z	milage		but the keyboard and rest of the screen was completely frozen
2007-04-26T09:56:00.000Z	milage		That's all I know
2007-04-26T09:56:00.000Z	milage		I can now, i restarted
2007-04-26T09:56:00.000Z	milage		when it was frozen, i couldn't do anything but move the cursor
2007-04-26T09:57:00.000Z	milage		about 3 since I installed it two days ago
2007-04-26T09:57:00.000Z	milage		Worth noting is that the music in Amarok kept playing
2007-04-26T09:57:00.000Z	milage		until it needed to load a new song
2007-04-26T09:57:00.000Z	milage		Are there any log files i could check?
2007-04-26T09:58:00.000Z	milage		I ran 6.10 64bit
2007-04-26T09:58:00.000Z	milage		didn't have that problem then
2007-04-26T09:58:00.000Z	voraistos	milage	did you notice any overheating?
2007-04-26T09:58:00.000Z	voraistos	milage	what graphics card are u using ?
2007-04-26T09:59:00.000Z	voraistos	milage	a good friend had troubles with an nividia overheating and causing this kind of troruble. you could check the graphics card temperature when idle, if it seems too high, get a refund or replaced.
2007-04-26T10:11:00.000Z	voraistos	milage	my friend has 3 years warranty on it :D
2007-04-26T10:11:00.000Z	voraistos	milage	i have no idea how to get the temp at all
2007-04-26T10:11:00.000Z	voraistos	milage	hey why do u have in C and me in F ? me curses the damn machine
2007-04-26T10:13:00.000Z	voraistos	milage	try to run X with a standard driver such as vesa or whatever, and wait for it to crash
2007-04-26T10:13:00.000Z	voraistos	milage	if it does not, then you get a hint already
2007-04-26T10:13:00.000Z	voraistos	milage	uh yesh
2007-04-26T10:14:00.000Z	voraistos	milage	dont bother
2007-04-26T10:14:00.000Z	voraistos	milage	if you say it can go a day without crashing....
