2009-06-01T15:04:00.000Z	zortec		Hi guys, still have not been able to install ubuntu.  It drops me to a busybox.  Can anyone help?
2009-06-01T15:05:00.000Z	fccf	zortec	you may have a bad copy
2009-06-01T15:05:00.000Z	zortec	fccf	I have tried burning the ISO three times.  Also tried safe graphics and the bugfix pci=nomsi and I can't get the installer to load.
2009-06-01T23:46:00.000Z	fccf	zortec	the correct way to put the name is how I just did with you ... type the first few letters of the name then push TAB
2009-06-01T23:46:00.000Z	zortec	fccf	Thanks, I got it now :)
2009-06-03T03:58:00.000Z	fccf	zortec	wow ... WoW is HUGE!!!
2009-06-03T04:35:00.000Z	zortec	fccf	.gnome2 takes up 10GB
2009-06-03T04:36:00.000Z	fccf	zortec	not on my machine ... look deeper into that folder and see what it is that is taking up that much space
2009-06-03T04:43:00.000Z	fccf	zortec	am  confused about your .gnome2 directory ... I'd like to know what in that dir is taking up so much space
2009-06-03T04:44:00.000Z	zortec	fccf	When I right click on the home dir, it shows 6,547 items totaling 11.9GB
2009-06-03T04:44:00.000Z	fccf	zortec	dig down .. to .gnome2 - and use list view to see what in .gnome2 is using that space
2009-06-03T04:45:00.000Z	fccf	zortec	details view - i meant
2009-06-03T04:48:00.000Z	fccf	zortec	inside .gnome2 ... look there for big files /home/zortec/.gnome2/ here
2009-06-03T04:49:00.000Z	zortec	fccf	.gnome2 doesn't have any big files
2009-06-03T04:49:00.000Z	fccf	zortec	.gnome2 is the one with 10gigs right?
2009-06-03T04:50:00.000Z	zortec	fccf	.gnome2 is only 63.7KB
2009-06-03T04:50:00.000Z	fccf	zortec	ok, earlier you said gnome was taking up 10gigs
2009-06-03T04:51:00.000Z	zortec	fccf	geirha, Kalmi_: So it's the trash then.  But it's going to take 10GB for the WoW files... so should I consider a bigger partition if I'm going to test gaming on linux? I did 3GB for swap, 10GB for /, and 20GB for home
2009-06-03T04:53:00.000Z	fccf	zortec	personally I don't use a home partition - just a 40 gig / and a 300gig stores-which is where I keep all radio station data -- and 8gig swap
2009-06-03T04:54:00.000Z	fccf	zortec	I have no intention of upgrading... I use LTS and this server will stay  locked in this mode for the life of the radio station
2009-06-03T05:02:00.000Z	fccf	zortec	you will need to do it from the live cd
