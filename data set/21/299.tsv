2012-05-29T21:32:00.000Z	xisorshadow		ok then ubuntu is pretty much unusable entirely for me since kde is terrible and this cant be customized AT ALL
2012-05-29T21:32:00.000Z	xisorshadow		:(
2012-05-29T21:34:00.000Z	xisorshadow		ubuntu customized thousand or tens of thousands of packages for their distro, why not this one? so its entirely their fault
2012-05-29T21:34:00.000Z	xisorshadow		or at least something they can fix
2012-05-29T21:36:00.000Z	xisorshadow		then i cant use ubuntu, and need to find an alternative that is as widely supported, and just as fast
2012-05-29T21:36:00.000Z	AcidRain2012	xisorshadow	what is your isse?
2012-05-29T21:37:00.000Z	AcidRain2012	xisorshadow	i have 6 monitors :D
2012-05-29T21:39:00.000Z	AcidRain2012	xisorshadow	i would suggest looking into nvidia drivers and cards
2012-05-29T21:40:00.000Z	xisorshadow	AcidRain2012	i have an nvidia card, doesnt change the fact that the panel is on the left side, so theres one right in the middle of my monitor setup
2012-05-29T21:40:00.000Z	AcidRain2012	xisorshadow	ah. i think the issue you are having is you need to manually adjust the screen on the monitor from the monitor itself
2012-05-29T21:40:00.000Z	AcidRain2012	xisorshadow	i had to do that with my main monitor (36" lcd)
2012-05-29T21:41:00.000Z	xisorshadow	AcidRain2012	what do you mean/
2012-05-29T21:41:00.000Z	AcidRain2012	xisorshadow	like on my tv, i have the option to adjust the screen left/right down/up
2012-05-29T21:42:00.000Z	AcidRain2012	xisorshadow	did you try what i said to do?
2012-05-29T21:42:00.000Z	AcidRain2012	xisorshadow	if you the menu button on your monitor, u should find it in the settings
2012-05-29T21:42:00.000Z	xisorshadow	AcidRain2012	im not sure how adjusting my monitor is going to solve my problem, my problem is theres a bar on the left side of EACH monitor
2012-05-29T21:43:00.000Z	AcidRain2012	xisorshadow	take a screenshot, idk what bar you mean
2012-05-29T21:43:00.000Z	AcidRain2012	xisorshadow	my advice is to upgrade from the current version of ubuntu you have installed to 11.04
2012-05-29T21:44:00.000Z	xisorshadow	AcidRain2012	i have 12.04
2012-05-29T21:48:00.000Z	AcidRain2012	xisorshadow	im pretty sure if you go to software center you can install the gnome2 shell
2012-05-29T21:48:00.000Z	AcidRain2012	xisorshadow	yeah i know. lol
