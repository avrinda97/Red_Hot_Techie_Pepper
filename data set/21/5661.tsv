2008-02-07T05:50:00.000Z	Pie-rate		Does AOL dialup require some kind of software to connect? I'm helping a neighbor set up an ubuntu box, they have AOL dialup (yeah, it's the only feasable connection here), i tested the modem with a free dialup service and it worked. AOL isn't, however. the modem makes its annoying noises, and then the tx/rx lights flash a little, and then all the lights go off and it disconnects. I was thinking it either got the wrong login info or it n

2008-02-07T05:53:00.000Z	nemilar	Pie-rate	I don't believe you can use AOL with Linux
2008-02-07T05:53:00.000Z	nemilar	Pie-rate	best you could do is maybe run it in wine?
2008-02-07T05:53:00.000Z	Pie-rate	nemilar	lol
2008-02-07T05:54:00.000Z	nemilar	Pie-rate	actually googling for AOL in Linux gives a little hope
2008-02-07T05:54:00.000Z	nemilar	Pie-rate	yeah man, hook up your neighbor with some t1 action
2008-02-07T05:54:00.000Z	nemilar	Pie-rate	how dare you let someone use AOL when you have a t1
2008-02-07T05:55:00.000Z	nemilar	Pie-rate	run some cat6 or coax or somethin ;)
2008-02-07T05:55:00.000Z	Pie-rate	nemilar	they can't afford a mile of cable
2008-02-07T05:56:00.000Z	nemilar	Pie-rate	if AOL hasn't changed its protocol, something like this might work: http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/LinuxTutorialAOL.html
2008-02-07T05:58:00.000Z	Pie-rate	nemilar	why does aol have to do that crap
2008-02-07T05:58:00.000Z	nemilar	Pie-rate	proprietary is AOL's middle name
2008-02-07T05:59:00.000Z	Pie-rate	nemilar	i figured
2008-02-07T05:59:00.000Z	nemilar	Pie-rate	anything that uses standard dial-up protocols will work fine
2008-02-07T06:00:00.000Z	nemilar	Pie-rate	really, though, I bet you could figure out a way to share your connection.. It's a long distance but I'm willing to bet there's a way
2008-02-07T06:02:00.000Z	Pie-rate	nemilar	no. for starters, we'd have to support them. also, the setup costs would be prohibitively high for them and they would be a security risk.
2008-02-07T06:03:00.000Z	Pie-rate	nemilar	plus, they would use our bandwidth, and we'd have to add some kind of throttling that would cost more money or time to implement.
2008-02-07T06:12:00.000Z	nemilar	Pie-rate	I used to use netzero in linux, but that was a long, long time ago
2008-02-07T06:12:00.000Z	nemilar	Pie-rate	back when it was free and ad-supported, I just connected standardly, and so there were no ads for me :)
2008-02-07T06:13:00.000Z	nemilar	Pie-rate	so I'm guessing you could get it for Ubuntu
