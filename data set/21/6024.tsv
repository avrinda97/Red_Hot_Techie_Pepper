2007-07-12T06:09:00.000Z	alecwh		 I'm having a problem, and one I can't pin. I have fairly good system specs (see @ http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/29596/), and my computer just doesn't seem... up to par. I spent lots of money on this thing, and it doesn't feel like I'm getting it's potential. Compiz lags up, and Duel monitors lags up EVERYTHING. I bought two screens back in my vista days, and now, I can't use one of them because it lags up my system, bad. I want to use Compiz, too..
2007-07-12T06:11:00.000Z	Belboz99	alecwh	you have your video card plugged into the power supply?  And are you using the right drivers for your card?  "nv" driver does not have 3D acceleration, use nvidia aka nvidia-glx in apt if you have an nvidia card
2007-07-12T06:12:00.000Z	alecwh	Belboz99	yeah, it's plugged in and working... I don't know if I'm using the right drivers, how do I check?
2007-07-12T06:13:00.000Z	Belboz99	alecwh	look in your xorg.conf if you know you're way around the command line, otherwise, you should have an nvidia-settings tool if your card is an Nvidia based card
2007-07-12T06:14:00.000Z	alecwh	Belboz99	yes, I have an nvidia card. I've tried sudo nvidia-settings, but i don't see an option there for anything to speed my system up. I mean, I'm SICK of lagging! :(

2007-07-12T06:16:00.000Z	Belboz99	alecwh	that would help explain the slowdown, but that leads us to another problem, what does it do when it "dies"?
2007-07-12T06:16:00.000Z	alecwh	Belboz99	that was a bad term. It's just really really slow and laggy.
2007-07-12T06:17:00.000Z	Belboz99	alecwh	which method did you use for installing compiz? and have you tried Beryl?
2007-07-12T06:18:00.000Z	Belboz99	alecwh	turn Compiz on, then load up nvidia-settings and see if you can find your GPU core temperature
2007-07-12T06:19:00.000Z	Belboz99	alecwh	that's not too bad
2007-07-12T06:20:00.000Z	alecwh	Belboz99	any other ideas?
2007-07-12T06:20:00.000Z	Belboz99	alecwh	I have to tell ya, I've got Beryl working flawlessly on Feisty, but any game in Cedega runs like crap, 0-5FPS :(
2007-07-12T06:21:00.000Z	Belboz99	alecwh	are you by chance using Ubuntu-64?
2007-07-12T06:22:00.000Z	Belboz99	alecwh	Gutsy Gibbon is supposed to make multiple monitors a breeze
2007-07-12T06:23:00.000Z	Belboz99	alecwh	it's due for release on October 19th IIRC
2007-07-12T06:24:00.000Z	Belboz99	alecwh	you can download the Alpha version right now, its' Tribe 2, Tribe 3 is due in another week or two
2007-07-12T06:24:00.000Z	Belboz99	alecwh	I'm not sure if multiple monitor support is implemented yet or not though
2007-07-12T06:25:00.000Z	Belboz99	alecwh	it's highly beta right now, I couldn't even get into the GUI when I tried it, even on the Live CD :(
2007-07-12T06:25:00.000Z	Belboz99	alecwh	how much RAM is on your motherboard?
2007-07-12T06:26:00.000Z	alecwh	Belboz99	2 gigs
