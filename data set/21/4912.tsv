2010-07-08T14:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	JonathanEllis	What version of Ubuntu are you using?
2010-07-08T14:11:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	Jordan_U	Hardy Heron
2010-07-08T14:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	JonathanEllis	Have you considered upgrading to lucid?
2010-07-08T14:12:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	Jordan_U	I cant run any version higher than Hardy. My graphics adapter stopped working when I tried
2010-07-08T14:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	JonathanEllis	What GPU exactly?
2010-07-08T14:12:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	Jordan_U	GPU?
2010-07-08T14:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	JonathanEllis	Graphics Processing Unit (graphics adapter)
2010-07-08T14:14:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	Jordan_U	Its an old matrox twin head card. MGA G200
2010-07-08T14:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	JonathanEllis	Ouch, matrox is notoriously poorly supported.
2010-07-08T14:15:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	Jordan_U	Yes. It took ages to get that working (http://forum.tuxx-home.at/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=797&sid=a2008ef8840e4d109e28735551b169dd). Trouble is I was a bit limited for cards as I only have PCI slots, not AGP or PCI Express. Its an old computer
2010-07-08T14:16:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	Jordan_U	And I remember reading there was no driver for anything later than Hardy
2010-07-08T14:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	JonathanEllis	VESA should always get you something, but I assume that when you say it's a dual head card you actually want to be able to use dual displays.
2010-07-08T14:17:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	Jordan_U	Yes
2010-07-08T14:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	JonathanEllis	The problem is that upgrading your kernel will probably break your Matrox setup.
2010-07-08T14:19:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	Jordan_U	Its starting to look like running a cable through the wall is going to be my quickest way to get working. Its a desktop machine anyway so it makes more sense for it to be a wired connection and there is much less to go wrong.
2010-07-08T14:19:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	Jordan_U	I was alternatively thinking about using ndiswrapper and a windows driver but that looks complicated
2010-07-08T14:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	JonathanEllis	What are you going to do in a year when 8.04 is no longer supported on the desktop? Do you think you'll have different hardware by then?
2010-07-08T14:23:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	Jordan_U	I guess I will have to burn that bridge when I get to it. Can't afford to buy a new PC and laptop just now
2010-07-08T14:23:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	Jordan_U	And the choice of hardware is bewildering
2010-07-08T14:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	JonathanEllis	What happens when you boot from a 10.04 liveCD?
2010-07-08T14:25:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	Jordan_U	Not tried it. As I say, there is no graphics driver later than Hardy. I remember trying the Karmic LiveCD and the screen didnt work
