2009-01-06T02:56:00.000Z	omnydevi		izaltal - well, what raid array?
2009-01-06T02:57:00.000Z	omnydevi		izantal - yeah, the creation of the raid will wipe all data sadly
2009-01-06T02:58:00.000Z	omnydevi		asul - wow, thanks for correcting me, i would look into that...if i needed a raid1, heh
2009-01-06T02:59:00.000Z	omnydevi		Bear - you vi the /etc/X11/xorg.conf and find the driver being used and replace it with VESA
2009-01-06T02:59:00.000Z	omnydevi		you will get a low screen resolution most likely, but it will come up
2009-01-06T03:00:00.000Z	Bear7809	omnydevi	what would i put in the command line? im not exactly the best with it.
2009-01-06T03:00:00.000Z	Bear7809	omnydevi	no, none, monitor gets no signal. Goes to standby. I can access console and log in by pressing ctrl alt f1. monitor comes back on.
2009-01-06T03:02:00.000Z	Bear7809	omnydevi	ATI All-in Wonder 9600 series.
2009-01-06T03:02:00.000Z	Bear7809	omnydevi	editing it to just use VESA is fairly easy after that?
2009-01-06T03:03:00.000Z	Bear7809	omnydevi	im afraid I have not.
2009-01-06T03:04:00.000Z	Bear7809	omnydevi	so get to the graphics part, then replace whatever driver is there with just the word VESA?
2009-01-06T03:06:00.000Z	Bear7809	omnydevi	do i just type w or :w?
2009-01-06T03:07:00.000Z	Bear7809	omnydevi	startx is just a command i can imput without anything extra?
2009-01-06T03:08:00.000Z	Bear7809	omnydevi	finally just reboot?
2009-01-06T03:29:00.000Z	Bear7809	omnydevi	hey omny you in here?
2009-01-06T03:30:00.000Z	Bear7809	omnydevi	so i put in the command sudo vi /etc/x11/xorg.cong
2009-01-06T03:31:00.000Z	Bear7809	omnydevi	i just get that in quotes at the bottom with [NEW DIRECTORY] right beside it
2009-01-06T03:31:00.000Z	Bear7809	omnydevi	then nothing, its not like i can do anything, and moving the arrow keys shows me no real progression.
2009-01-06T03:32:00.000Z	Bear7809	omnydevi	do you mean in sudo vi?
2009-01-06T03:32:00.000Z	Bear7809	omnydevi	because if thats the case i just see a bunc of blue ~ and at the bottom is the directory you speak of. i can put in some commands but thats it.
2009-01-06T03:35:00.000Z	Bear7809	omnydevi	that or i copied it wrong.
