2011-12-21T17:26:00.000Z	Gerapa		i have ubuntu 10.04 and when i made sleep it and "woke up" computer wireless connection doesn't connect, however it works in windows, what should i do?
2011-12-21T17:26:00.000Z	Gerapa		please help me :/
2011-12-21T17:28:00.000Z	minimec	Gerapa	Can you disable/enable wireless networking with the indicator applet after 'wake up'?
2011-12-21T17:29:00.000Z	minimec	Gerapa	open a terminal and type 'rfkill unblock wifi'
2011-12-21T17:32:00.000Z	Gerapa	minimec	I did it
2011-12-21T17:32:00.000Z	Gerapa	minimec	still cant connect or I need to restart?
2011-12-21T17:33:00.000Z	minimec	Gerapa	what does 'rfkill list' say? Is wireless LAN blocked in any way?
2011-12-21T17:34:00.000Z	Gerapa	minimec	it didn't say anything
2011-12-21T17:34:00.000Z	minimec	Gerapa	rfkill list without ''
2011-12-21T17:35:00.000Z	Gerapa	minimec	I have done it without ' ' should I try with them? lol
2011-12-21T17:36:00.000Z	minimec	Gerapa	hmmm... simply rfkill?
2011-12-21T17:40:00.000Z	Gerapa	minimec	I get error when I type rfkill because u need to specify commands
2011-12-21T17:41:00.000Z	Gerapa	minimec	When I type rfkill list then dell-wifi: wireless LAN soft block and hard blocked indicates no
2011-12-21T17:43:00.000Z	minimec	Gerapa	I had to know, if rfkill is installed... ;) rfkill list should show you all available devices that are handled by rfkill. It should be wifi and bluetooth or something. It should also show you, if the devices are hard/soft blocked.
2011-12-21T17:43:00.000Z	Gerapa	minimec	So I have said that its not blocked..
2011-12-21T17:44:00.000Z	minimec	Gerapa	I did not see that... sorry ;) Can you block it once using 'rfkill block wifi', and then unblock it again?
2011-12-21T17:45:00.000Z	Gerapa	minimec	I have done it but still doesn't work
2011-12-21T17:50:00.000Z	minimec	Gerapa	I would play around with that... For example: 1. Block the device, 2. suspend the machine, 3. wake up the machine, 4. unblock wifi.... Or 1. unblock the device, 2. suspend computer, 3. Shutdown Computer by pressing ON button for a ertain time. Restatrt Computer... When restarting the router, did you plug the power and wait for 10 seconds to clear all memory?
2011-12-21T17:52:00.000Z	Gerapa	minimec	not 10seconds I think I just clicked button to turn off and then turn on
2011-12-21T17:52:00.000Z	Gerapa	minimec	I can try it again and wait 10seconds but I think it shouldnt make difference
2011-12-21T17:53:00.000Z	minimec	Gerapa	I would do so. Like that we can be sure, that the router is not the problem.
