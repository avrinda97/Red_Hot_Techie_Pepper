2006-06-17T15:35:00.000Z	neutrinomass	bilss	Google ?
2006-06-17T08:17:00.000Z	bilss	neutrinomass	any ideas about my problem?  ssh keeps dropping after about an hour on line if i try to connect from a remote host to my box on port 22 it times ou
2006-06-17T08:18:00.000Z	neutrinomass	bilss	Not really. Did you try what ompaul suggested earlier ?
2006-06-17T08:21:00.000Z	bilss	neutrinomass	i am not sure if i understood fully what ompaul was suggesting and he was gone when i replied
2006-06-17T08:22:00.000Z	neutrinomass	bilss	ompaul suggested that you keep the connection alive by pinging something - it's not a fix, but it's a first step
2006-06-17T08:25:00.000Z	neutrinomass	bilss	A bot ...
2006-06-17T08:27:00.000Z	neutrinomass	bilss	You don't have 'ping' on your box ? Or are ICMP requests blocked ?
2006-06-17T08:28:00.000Z	bilss	neutrinomass	 does he mean ping -i 57 127.0.0.1 in a terminal and mimamizise it yes i can ping but no in a ssh terminal
2006-06-17T08:29:00.000Z	neutrinomass	bilss	Hm... I don't really understand. Why don't you do 'ping -i 57 127.0.0.1 & ' , so that you can work while pinging ?
2006-06-17T08:32:00.000Z	bilss	neutrinomass	ok lets start again the problem is not while i am connected it is connecting from a remote host, if my labtop has not been active for more than an hour the ssh drops i get time out so is the suggestion that i open a terminal before leving my labtop and type  > ping -i 57 127.0.0.1 and leave it running while i am away?
2006-06-17T08:33:00.000Z	neutrinomass	bilss	Yes :( Try filing a bug report as well, although I don't know against what you should file it .... maybe the kernel ?
2006-06-17T08:36:00.000Z	bilss	neutrinomass	if my labtop is running say a mail server that terminal pinging is going to get pretty big?
2006-06-17T08:41:00.000Z	bilss	neutrinomass	so just open a terminal and run ping -i 57 127.0.0.1 &>/dev/null   is this line correct are the spaces correct?
2006-06-17T08:41:00.000Z	neutrinomass	bilss	ping -i 57 127.0.0.1 &>/dev/null  &
2006-06-17T08:41:00.000Z	neutrinomass	bilss	That should be the correct line...
2006-06-17T08:44:00.000Z	bilss	neutrinomass	ok thanks i will do it in a sh shell and minimize pa aux should tell me if its running
2006-06-17T08:45:00.000Z	neutrinomass	bilss	You're welcome, I hope it works out :)
2006-06-17T08:47:00.000Z	bilss	neutrinomass	when i put that in a sh shell and press enter the curser comes back to the prompt again but inset  is [1]  5136
2006-06-17T08:47:00.000Z	neutrinomass	bilss	That'sthe PID of the process ... it tells you its running ...
2006-06-17T08:48:00.000Z	bilss	neutrinomass	ok thanks hope it works
