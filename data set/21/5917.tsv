2007-07-11T14:50:00.000Z	astro76	DBLue	what distro version are you running?
2007-07-11T14:51:00.000Z	astro76	DBLue	did you install python from the repos, i.e. sudo apt-get install python ?
2007-07-11T14:51:00.000Z	DBLue	astro76	i did by double-click
2007-07-11T14:51:00.000Z	astro76	DBLue	where did you download it from then?
2007-07-11T14:53:00.000Z	astro76	DBLue	well you had to get it from somewhere, Goshawk is right, it should already be installed
2007-07-11T14:53:00.000Z	astro76	DBLue	you need to stick with packages for ubuntu feisty only, preferably from official repos
2007-07-11T14:53:00.000Z	astro76	DBLue	or expect serious breakage
2007-07-11T15:01:00.000Z	astro76	DBLue	try dpkg --remove
2007-07-11T15:01:00.000Z	astro76	DBLue	for the python package
2007-07-11T15:03:00.000Z	DBLue	astro76	do you have any other suggestions?
2007-07-11T15:04:00.000Z	astro76	DBLue	dpkg --remove --force-depends
2007-07-11T15:04:00.000Z	astro76	DBLue	that will remove it without removing the other packages, which is dangerous
2007-07-11T15:05:00.000Z	astro76	DBLue	yes
2007-07-11T15:05:00.000Z	astro76	DBLue	what do you mean?
2007-07-11T15:06:00.000Z	astro76	DBLue	2.5.1
2007-07-11T15:06:00.000Z	astro76	DBLue	to be exact 2.5.1~rc1-0ubuntu3
2007-07-11T15:07:00.000Z	DBLue	astro76	thanks.
