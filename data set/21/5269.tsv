2007-12-03T15:13:00.000Z	RatThing	Ein_	which scanner do you have
2007-12-03T15:14:00.000Z	RatThing	Ein_	is it a USB scanner?
2007-12-03T15:16:00.000Z	RatThing	Ein_	here's the basic setup method, see how you feel about it :-) You have to find a .bin file on the Windows installation CD that came with that scanner...
2007-12-03T15:16:00.000Z	RatThing	Ein_	then it has to be copied to a directory and a configuration file has to be editied.
2007-12-03T15:17:00.000Z	RatThing	Ein_	pretty much that is it.
2007-12-03T15:18:00.000Z	RatThing	Ein_	another thing is to find out if xsane supports your scanner :-) just googling now.
2007-12-03T15:20:00.000Z	RatThing	Ein_	I googled "sane epson RX520" and the top problems seem to be on OS/2 so prolly it will work.

2007-12-03T15:24:00.000Z	RatThing	Ein_	install xsane: sudo apt-get install xsane
2007-12-03T15:24:00.000Z	RatThing	Ein_	you are going to need that for the scanning.
2007-12-03T15:24:00.000Z	RatThing	Ein_	xsane is the scanning application.
2007-12-03T15:26:00.000Z	RatThing	Ein_	once xsane is installed you need to edit a file in /etc/sane.d/
2007-12-03T15:27:00.000Z	RatThing	Ein_	sorry to be vague but it will be a .conf file that makes mention of your scanner.
2007-12-03T15:28:00.000Z	RatThing	Ein_	copy the .bin file from your Windows installation CD to: /usr/share/sane/mayBeAnotherDir/
2007-12-03T15:30:00.000Z	RatThing	Ein_	In the .conf file I mentioned, changed the firemware reference to that bin file so: firmware /usr/share/sane/mayBeAnotherDir/your.bin
2007-12-03T15:30:00.000Z	RatThing	Ein_	restart the scanner.
2007-12-03T15:31:00.000Z	RatThing	Ein_	Start xsane
