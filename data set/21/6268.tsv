2010-02-06T07:33:00.000Z	Gnea	bullgard	you might need to use losetup
2010-02-06T07:34:00.000Z	Gnea	bullgard	or try without the -t squashfs option
2010-02-06T07:36:00.000Z	bullgard	Gnea	I am not familiar with 'losetup'. Do you mean this: http://www.faqs.org/docs/Linux-HOWTO/Loopback-Encrypted-Filesystem-HOWTO.html?
2010-02-06T07:37:00.000Z	bullgard	Gnea	Trying without the '-t squashfs' option obtains the same result.
2010-02-06T07:38:00.000Z	Gnea	bullgard	kind of, but without the encryption part
2010-02-06T07:39:00.000Z	bullgard	Gnea	Thank you for commenting. I think I will need more snooping.
2011-02-23T15:29:00.000Z	Gnea	bullgard	well you could ping the broadcast and then look at the arp table
2011-02-23T15:32:00.000Z	bullgard	Gnea	What do you mean by "ping the broadcast"?
2011-02-23T15:33:00.000Z	Gnea	bullgard	get your broadcast address from ifconfig, then: sudo ping -b broadcast-ip
2011-02-23T15:33:00.000Z	Gnea	bullgard	then look at the arp table: arp -a
2011-02-23T15:34:00.000Z	Gnea	bullgard	nmap could work too, you might have false positives using both so they are good together
2011-02-23T16:01:00.000Z	bullgard	Gnea	'~$ arp -a; fritz.fonwlan.box (192.168.178.1) at 00:1c:4a:a:b:c [ether] on eth0'. May I conclude that there is only one known host in this LAN?
2011-02-23T16:01:00.000Z	Gnea	bullgard	well, as long as you run the command shortly after you run the ping command, it's possible
2011-02-23T16:02:00.000Z	bullgard	Gnea	Yes, I have run the command shortly after the ping command.
2011-02-23T16:03:00.000Z	Gnea	bullgard	okay, so now try nmap
2011-02-23T16:03:00.000Z	Gnea	bullgard	etherape is good, too
2011-02-23T16:53:00.000Z	Gnea	bullgard	*weird*! you're right.... wow
2011-02-23T17:30:00.000Z	bullgard	Gnea	Thank you for commenting.
2011-02-23T17:35:00.000Z	Gnea	bullgard	did you get it sorted?
2011-02-23T17:38:00.000Z	bullgard	Gnea	I am struggeling on 2 fronts at the moment. I did not solve yet the question how to determine the known host computers in my LAN.
2011-02-23T18:02:00.000Z	bullgard	Gnea	[solved]
