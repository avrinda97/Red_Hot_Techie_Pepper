2009-06-09T23:28:00.000Z	tvoet_		does anyone know of a fix for remote desktop on jaunty where the target computer doesn't refresh the screen?  for example i click on a button, don't see anything, but if i disconnect and reconnect the action occured fine
2009-06-09T23:30:00.000Z	cabrey	tvoet_	yea thats VNC
2009-06-09T23:30:00.000Z	cabrey	tvoet_	honestly VNC sucks I would go with nx
2009-06-09T23:31:00.000Z	tvoet_	cabrey	nx?
2009-06-09T23:31:00.000Z	cabrey	tvoet_	even better, nx uses ssh natively
2009-06-09T23:32:00.000Z	cabrey	tvoet_	yes, linux os x solaris windows etc
2009-06-09T23:33:00.000Z	cabrey	tvoet_	no idea tbh
2009-06-09T23:33:00.000Z	tvoet_	cabrey	tbh?
2009-06-09T23:33:00.000Z	cabrey	tvoet_	to be honest
2009-06-09T23:33:00.000Z	tvoet_	cabrey	thanks
2009-06-09T23:53:00.000Z	tvoet_	cabrey	the service is still there, but i can't ssh into any of my user accounts
2009-06-09T23:46:00.000Z	tvoet_	cabrey	trying to setup FreeNx, and getting weird issues, could not connect to NX server
2009-06-09T23:47:00.000Z	cabrey	tvoet_	nx uses its own ssh username & keys, then it su's to the user you want
2009-06-09T23:49:00.000Z	tvoet_	cabrey	nice i just got locked out of my machine.  everytime i try to login, i get a too many authentication failures
2009-06-09T23:50:00.000Z	cabrey	tvoet_	what do you mean? you got locked out from the server machine?
2009-06-09T23:51:00.000Z	tvoet_	cabrey	meaning i was SSH'ed into the machine when i tried to run the setup, and when i restarted the SSH process, i can't login anymore ( with any of the account si have on the machine )
2009-06-09T23:52:00.000Z	tvoet_	cabrey	it royally messed up my SSH, no way in anymore.  have to wait to get home to try and UNDO from the actual console.  even my gitosis setup got fried
2009-06-09T23:53:00.000Z	cabrey	tvoet_	that doesnt make any sense. nx should use the existing ssh service
2009-06-09T23:53:00.000Z	tvoet_	cabrey	but like you said it inserts itself into the process, so now none of my users can login that way.
2009-06-09T23:54:00.000Z	cabrey	tvoet_	no what it does is create a nx user and the client logs in through that, but it shouldnt mess with anything
2009-06-09T23:55:00.000Z	tvoet_	cabrey	ok, but it did.  i will check when i get home.
