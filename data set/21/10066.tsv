2005-05-23T12:50:00.000Z	Thirsteh		Gaaah... DMA on makes my DVD playback very very laggy, DMA off makes it... just annoyingly laggy :(
2005-05-23T12:50:00.000Z	Thirsteh		And I don't have a slow system
2005-05-23T12:50:00.000Z	Thirsteh		gah-ness
2005-05-23T12:52:00.000Z	Xgates	Thirsteh	yeah video playback for me last month when I first installed Ubuntu to check it out lagged too, and I compiled xine from scratch, custome compiled the kernel and killed almost all of the serivces so the box would be running pretty clean and I still had problems
2005-05-23T12:52:00.000Z	Xgates	Thirsteh	didn't think about the DMA though hmm
2005-05-23T12:52:00.000Z	Thirsteh	Xgates	 :(
2005-05-23T12:53:00.000Z	Thirsteh	Xgates	if I'm copying files from CD, the same thing happens, my system goes unstable until it's done
2005-05-23T13:02:00.000Z	Thirsteh	Xgates	ahhh okay
2005-05-23T12:54:00.000Z	Xgates	Thirsteh	I've been surfing distrowatch for the last hour thinking to install another distro, after 5 years in Slack, I'm getting a bit tired and out of time for compiling all the time, LOL
2005-05-23T12:54:00.000Z	Thirsteh	Xgates	lol
2005-05-23T12:59:00.000Z	Thirsteh	Xgates	I just fixed the problem!!!
2005-05-23T13:00:00.000Z	Thirsteh	Xgates	I just turned Multi mode DMA2 or something on, and it runs smooth now
2005-05-23T13:00:00.000Z	Xgates	Thirsteh	what did you do?
2005-05-23T13:00:00.000Z	Xgates	Thirsteh	how?
2005-05-23T13:00:00.000Z	Thirsteh	Xgates	sudo hdparm -d1 -X34 /dev/cdrom
2005-05-23T13:01:00.000Z	Xgates	Thirsteh	hmm I thought we are more concerned for DMA on the hdd not a cdrom
2005-05-23T13:01:00.000Z	Thirsteh	Xgates	well my CD/DVD drive was the problem here, and that fixed it :)
2005-05-23T13:02:00.000Z	Xgates	Thirsteh	well for me I was playing a movie off the hdd
2005-05-23T13:02:00.000Z	Xgates	Thirsteh	maybe I can run something like that on the hdd then
2005-05-23T13:02:00.000Z	Thirsteh	Xgates	maybe
2005-05-23T13:17:00.000Z	Xgates	Thirsteh	you gonna be around for awhile?
