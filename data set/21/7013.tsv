2006-12-17T13:29:00.000Z	cchristianTPclon		I'm getting the Infamous Error 17 again
2006-12-17T13:29:00.000Z	cchristianTPclon		and Compaq did it
2006-12-17T13:30:00.000Z	cchristianTPclon		HELLO.
2006-12-17T13:31:00.000Z	cchristianTPclon		I can't get into the system, can I do it from BIOS?
2006-12-17T13:32:00.000Z	cchristianTPclon		how do I get the GRUB menu?
2006-12-17T13:33:00.000Z	tim167	cchristianTPclon	press escape on startup, when you see grum
2006-12-17T13:33:00.000Z	tim167	cchristianTPclon	i mean GRUB
2006-12-17T13:33:00.000Z	cchristianTPclon	tim167	ok
2006-12-17T13:35:00.000Z	cchristianTPclon	tim167	so...  after COMPAQ dissapears, hit esc?
2006-12-17T13:35:00.000Z	tim167	cchristianTPclon	something like that yes, you have to watch your screen closely, and hit esc as soon as GRUB shows up
2006-12-17T13:36:00.000Z	tim167	cchristianTPclon	good luck :-D
2006-12-17T13:38:00.000Z	cchristianTPclon	tim167	so...  when it says "GRUB Loading stage 1.5"?
2006-12-17T13:39:00.000Z	tim167	cchristianTPclon	yes, actually I think it also says something like : "hit escape to enter grub menu" but you dont have much time...
2006-12-17T13:39:00.000Z	cchristianTPclon	tim167	It says:
2006-12-17T13:40:00.000Z	tim167	cchristianTPclon	I'm not sure, maybe it only allows this menu if you have multiple kernels/os-es installed...?
2006-12-17T13:41:00.000Z	tim167	cchristianTPclon	yes, but maybe, that error message means grub could not load
2006-12-17T13:44:00.000Z	tim167	cchristianTPclon	your HD partition seems to be broken
2006-12-17T13:44:00.000Z	cchristianTPclon	tim167	huh?
2006-12-17T13:45:00.000Z	tim167	cchristianTPclon	 at least: grub cannot load the partition its supposed to, see your link : " This error is returned if the partition requested exists, but the filesystem type cannot be recognized by GRUB."
