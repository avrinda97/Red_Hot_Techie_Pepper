2012-09-09T03:04:00.000Z	Deet`		i swear to god i'm going to empty my .38 in to this thing
2012-09-09T03:05:00.000Z	Deet`		casuse iwconfig either isn't working right or none of these tutorial writers have any idea what they are doing
2012-09-09T03:06:00.000Z	Meris	Deet`	maybe your wireless card is badly supported?
2012-09-09T03:08:00.000Z	Meris	Deet`	ah, a MacBook, which one are you using?
2012-09-09T03:09:00.000Z	Meris	Deet`	a G3? That's lappy belongs in a museum.

2012-09-09T03:10:00.000Z	Meris	Deet`	you may have more luck with the Yellowdog distro. It has ebeen mad especially for use on pre-Intel Macs.
2012-09-09T03:11:00.000Z	Deet`	Meris	and i could download mac drives to a usb, but i wouldn't have the slightest idea how to load them via commandline
2012-09-09T03:11:00.000Z	Meris	Deet`	check out YDL.net
2012-09-09T03:12:00.000Z	Meris	Deet`	it's a member of the RHEL family.
2012-09-09T03:18:00.000Z	Meris	Deet`	I believe there is also a minimal network-installation ISO
2012-09-09T03:20:00.000Z	Meris	Deet`	look up the YDL.net manual. you can also use CD-R's as installation medium.
2012-09-09T03:23:00.000Z	Meris	Deet`	I'm surprised that the 12.04 version runs at all. Impressive... Try the Alternate version instead. It has more options for odd or outdated computers. Still, I am doubtful if your G3 lappy will meet the minimum requirements, especially when it comes to memory requirements.
2012-09-09T03:26:00.000Z	Meris	Deet`	if it exceeds the minimums by ahair you won't be able to run X-Windows. The console should be available though.
2012-09-09T03:29:00.000Z	Meris	Deet`	try the safe video mode. However, the safe video mode is heavier on the CPU, because all gfx will be rendered by CPU alone.
2012-09-09T03:30:00.000Z	Meris	Deet`	probably. There are distro's which are geared specifically to very old hardware, such as Puppy Linux, most are exclusively for the x86-platform though.
2012-09-09T03:31:00.000Z	Meris	Deet`	my Pentium3 lappy  runs great on Puppy Wary
2012-09-09T03:33:00.000Z	Meris	Deet`	in that case use the Alternate version. Still, I think that Ubuntu 12.04 won't be viable option on your machine, not even the low-resource desktops will run properly.
2012-09-09T03:33:00.000Z	Deet`	Meris	ok, i'll go looking around YellowDogs website
2012-09-09T03:33:00.000Z	Meris	Deet`	It doesn't hurt to try of course ;-) It *will* cost you time, however.
2012-09-09T03:34:00.000Z	Meris	Deet`	good luck :-)
