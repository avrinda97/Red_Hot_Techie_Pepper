2009-05-18T00:52:00.000Z	Phlexonance		I have a problem with my /etc/resolv.conf, after some time (somewhat 2-3 hours of internet use) the nameservers aren't in it anymore and are replaced by a line which says "nameserver 10.10.10.10"
2009-05-18T00:52:00.000Z	Slart	Phlexonance	have you setup your own dns servers?
2009-05-18T00:52:00.000Z	Slart	Phlexonance	it sounds like it's the dhcp server that is overwriting the dns server info
2009-05-18T00:53:00.000Z	Slart	Phlexonance	hmm.. but you get the weird ones if you wait an hour or so..
2009-05-18T00:55:00.000Z	Slart	Phlexonance	can you check the syslog and see if it says something about it.. remember the time when it starts using the new dns servers and check the syslog..
2009-05-18T00:55:00.000Z	Slart	Phlexonance	yea, sure
2009-05-18T00:56:00.000Z	Slart	Phlexonance	hang on
2009-05-18T00:56:00.000Z	Slart	Phlexonance	that works too
2009-05-18T00:57:00.000Z	Slart	Phlexonance	I assume that that ip-number isn't your regular dhcp server?
2009-05-18T01:00:00.000Z	Slart	Phlexonance	hmm.. then it sounds like the dhcp server is handing out a bad ip-number of dns server.. but only sometimes.. that's strange
2009-05-18T01:01:00.000Z	Slart	Phlexonance	you could always use the "prepend" keyword in the dhclient configuration to add your own dns servers.. try the opendns dns-servers..
2009-05-18T01:02:00.000Z	Slart	Phlexonance	but yes.. if the dhcp server was doing this for everyone I think they would get a lot of phone calls
2009-05-18T01:02:00.000Z	Phlexonance	Slart	can you give me a hint on modification of the dhclient configuration so that I add my own static nameservers (which are the ones I SHOULD get from the dhcp anyway) please?
2009-05-18T01:03:00.000Z	Slart	Phlexonance	sure.. it's .. /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf  .. "gksudo gedit /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf"
2009-05-18T01:04:00.000Z	Slart	Phlexonance	then you add a line with "prepend domain-name-servers 127.0.0.1;".. change the 127.0.0.1 to the opendns dns servers.. hang on.. I'll get the ip's
2009-05-18T01:05:00.000Z	Slart	Phlexonance	ok
2009-05-18T01:07:00.000Z	Slart	Phlexonance	well.. a simple "sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart" would do it.. it will kill the irc connection though
2009-05-18T01:08:00.000Z	Slart	Phlexonance	the defaults works for almost everyone.. but if you need to change something they've put some examples in that file
2009-05-18T01:08:00.000Z	Slart	Phlexonance	give it a try.. good luck
2009-05-18T01:11:00.000Z	Phlexonance	Slart	it worked, I hope it keeps working without my further doing =) thanks a lot ! have a nice evening (or whatever your timezone says)
2009-05-18T01:11:00.000Z	Slart	Phlexonance	you're welcome and have a nice evening too,
