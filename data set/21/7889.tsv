2007-10-08T11:35:00.000Z	Kronos		guyz aparently this says it failed to initialise the nvidia kernel module coz its version is 1.09755 but the X module is only version 1.09631, what should i do install a newer X module? or an earlyer nvidia kernel... ?
2007-10-08T11:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	Kronos	you likely has both nvidia-glx and nvidia-glx-ne instaled or you have one of those and used envy or installled another driver manually
2007-10-08T11:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	Kronos	stick with *only* one of the drivers
2007-10-08T11:37:00.000Z	Kronos	erUSUL	good adivce, but i'm really new with linux and i have no clue how to check wether thats that case or how to fix it if that;s so
2007-10-08T11:37:00.000Z	Kronos	erUSUL	any tips?
2007-10-08T11:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	Kronos	do you used envy or automatix?
2007-10-08T11:39:00.000Z	Kronos	erUSUL	neither the first time i notivced a graphics driver beeing installed was when i activedted (or tried to) the special desktop effects ubuntu auto downloaded a driver and installed it ... then it restarted and it died so i had to (with some help from here) use the nano edditor to eddit Xorg.conf
2007-10-08T11:40:00.000Z	Kronos	erUSUL	this time i used the synaptics package manager to install the "nvidia_glx_new" and it said it was gonna unistall the old driver and install the new one and then i got stuck in this message i'm in now
2007-10-08T11:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	Kronos	use synaptic to search nvidia-glx and make sure only one of the two nvidia-glx or nvidia-glx-new is instaled (keep the -new)
2007-10-08T11:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	Kronos	somehow some files where not properly uninstaled
2007-10-08T11:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	Kronos	use synaptic and purge the two packages and then install one of the two
2007-10-08T11:43:00.000Z	Kronos	erUSUL	kk trying to do that now, seems i have to use the nano edditor yet again to change the "driver" back to "nv" since i cant even get into the main destop now
2007-10-08T11:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	Kronos	you can do what i said from command line too
2007-10-08T11:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	Kronos	sudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia-glx nvidia-glx-new and then after that sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-new
2007-10-08T11:45:00.000Z	Kronos	erUSUL	seems its all i got access to, however i have no clue how to, i've only been using ubuntu and linux in general for 2 days...
2007-10-08T11:45:00.000Z	Kronos	erUSUL	ok scratch that .. ty
2007-10-08T11:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	Kronos	if you boot in recovery mode you end up in a console... but you can edit xorg.conf if you prefer
2007-10-08T11:47:00.000Z	Kronos	erUSUL	i'm gonna try the command line way i can handle command lines =p
2007-10-08T11:52:00.000Z	Kronos	erUSUL	done but all it said was setting up nvidia-glx-new (bunch of version numbers) and then the prompt came back no comfirmation on wether or not was done successfuly.... is this normal?
2007-10-08T12:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	Kronos	yes, it is normal
2007-10-08T12:05:00.000Z	Kronos	erUSUL	ok it seemed to work fine and then as i just wrote i tryed enabling the desktop effects thing and it auto uninstalled the glx-new and installed the glx which damanged things again
