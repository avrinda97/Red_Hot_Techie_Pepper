2006-03-31T10:26:00.000Z	tzadik		hi there
2006-03-31T10:27:00.000Z	tzadik		I just got a sony digital camcorder
2006-03-31T10:27:00.000Z	tzadik		and I have no idea how to get started with it
2006-03-31T10:27:00.000Z	tzadik		i have just figured out (i think) that I need to get a video card
2006-03-31T10:28:00.000Z	tzadik		i mean... a video capture card
2006-03-31T10:28:00.000Z	tzadik		i had thought i could use usb
2006-03-31T10:28:00.000Z	tzadik		is it true that I need to get a capture card?
2006-03-31T10:28:00.000Z	tzadik		ieee1394 ?
2006-03-31T10:28:00.000Z	nlogax	tzadik	does your camera have firewire (1394) or USB2 ports?
2006-03-31T10:34:00.000Z	nlogax	tzadik	what is it you're trying to achieve exactly?  downloading recordings or realtime capture by the PC?  and what does the manual say about what you're trying to do?
2006-03-31T10:36:00.000Z	nlogax	tzadik	I would expect that your camera's storage would show up as a USB drive when you plug it in using USB
2006-03-31T10:36:00.000Z	nlogax	tzadik	certainly if you've already recorded to the camera's internal storage you shouldn't require a capture card - just copy the files over
2006-03-31T10:36:00.000Z	nlogax	tzadik	 OHHHH......
2006-03-31T10:37:00.000Z	nlogax	tzadik	I don't know.  Can I suggest you read the manual and see what the USB port on your cam is for?
2006-03-31T10:46:00.000Z	nlogax	tzadik	yeah you certainly shouldn't need video capture card, but you'll have to do some googling I think
2006-03-31T10:50:00.000Z	nlogax	tzadik	I suspect that your cam is like a webcam; if so you will need a kernel module for it and then you'll be able to test using xawtv
2006-03-31T10:51:00.000Z	nlogax	tzadik	what is the make/model of your camera?
2006-03-31T10:54:00.000Z	nlogax	tzadik	to use your cam as a USB device you'll need a kernel module
2006-03-31T10:55:00.000Z	nlogax	tzadik	what does lsusb say?  is there anything that looks like it could be your cam?  (don't paste the whole output here)
2006-03-31T10:56:00.000Z	nlogax	tzadik	do you have a memory card for it?
2006-03-31T11:10:00.000Z	tzadik	nlogax	sorry i had to say goodbye to some guests
