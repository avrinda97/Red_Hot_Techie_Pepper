2008-04-04T13:54:00.000Z	neeto		Whenever I plug in my ipod, my computer recognizes it as a different device file in deb... sometimes it's /dev/sdh2 sometimes it's /dev/sdg2 and so on... therefore, I can't really put it in fstab, because fstab (as far as I know) requires that the mount point for the device being mounted in /media always be the same. Is there another way to detect which device is the ipod and mount it at...
2008-04-04T13:54:00.000Z	neeto		.../media/ipod every time it's connected?
2008-04-04T13:56:00.000Z	DistroJockey	neeto	maybe  blkid  and an entry in  /etc/mtab  ?
2008-04-04T13:58:00.000Z	neeto	DistroJockey	thanks
2008-04-04T13:58:00.000Z	DistroJockey	neeto	np. Not sure if it will work, but it may be worth a look
2008-04-04T13:59:00.000Z	neeto	DistroJockey	I'll try it out and let you know
2008-04-04T13:59:00.000Z	DistroJockey	neeto	cool, good luck
2008-04-04T14:00:00.000Z	neeto	DistroJockey	how to I get the blkid of the ipod?
2008-04-04T14:01:00.000Z	neeto	DistroJockey	or any device for that matter
2008-04-04T14:01:00.000Z	DistroJockey	neeto	blkid /dev/whatever
2008-04-04T14:01:00.000Z	DistroJockey	neeto	while sudo'd
2008-04-04T14:02:00.000Z	neeto	DistroJockey	righto
2008-04-04T14:03:00.000Z	DistroJockey	neeto	always worth checking the man page for any command you are not sure about :)
2008-04-04T14:04:00.000Z	neeto	DistroJockey	yessir. how would I add this blkid to mtab? using blkid UUID="" TYPE="vfat"?
2008-04-04T14:04:00.000Z	DistroJockey	neeto	that part I am not familiar with, sorry
2008-04-04T14:08:00.000Z	DistroJockey	neeto	that udev stuff unop_ mentioned is worth a read. Not looked at it much yet, but it probably does what you need
2008-04-04T14:08:00.000Z	neeto	DistroJockey	yeah, I'm reading it now.
2008-04-08T14:06:00.000Z	DistroJockey	neeto	Something like   gkrellm   maybe?
2008-04-08T14:08:00.000Z	neeto	DistroJockey	I'll check it out. I am looking for those things that are basically embedded in the desktop and display all that information.
2008-04-08T14:08:00.000Z	DistroJockey	neeto	*nods*
