2005-07-25T15:52:00.000Z	Xyc0	Draga	What ATI are you using?
2005-07-25T15:52:00.000Z	Draga	Xyc0	it said ATI radeon xpress 200mobility :)
2005-07-25T15:53:00.000Z	Xyc0	Draga	But that could be the case, ATI doesnt have the best linux drivers
2005-07-25T15:54:00.000Z	Xyc0	Draga	did you try installing Ubuntu?
2005-07-25T15:54:00.000Z	Draga	Xyc0	I'm trying the live-64bit because i want to know if it works
2005-07-26T16:03:00.000Z	Xyc0	Draga	I really reccomend you install Linux, even on a Dual Boot so you can keep M$ just in case
2005-07-26T16:03:00.000Z	Xyc0	Draga	I can help you more when we can actualy modify Ubuntu
2005-07-26T16:03:00.000Z	Draga	Xyc0	But if the live-cd doesnt work so how i can EVEN instal it?
2005-07-26T16:04:00.000Z	Xyc0	Draga	Live-CD for Ubuntu is not the best in the world
2005-07-26T16:04:00.000Z	Xyc0	Draga	If you want to try linux in general, try Kipponix
2005-07-26T16:08:00.000Z	Xyc0	Draga	How long did you give it time to process?
2005-07-26T16:08:00.000Z	Draga	Xyc0	Hmm.. About couple of minutes
2005-07-26T16:09:00.000Z	Xyc0	Draga	I second kutucape, Ubuntu is a good distro, not a live-linux distro
2005-07-26T16:09:00.000Z	Draga	Xyc0	I'm only trying to test if it works on my computer that i shouldn't waist DVD:s
2005-07-26T16:13:00.000Z	Xyc0	Draga	Why are you using DVDs?  Just use a cheep CDR to run Live CDs
