2008-06-19T16:06:00.000Z	jrib	error404notfound	mutt and mail will both work
2008-06-19T16:07:00.000Z	error404notfound	jrib	hmmm, thank
2008-10-14T17:59:00.000Z	error404notfound	jrib	my question was different. I said does it need a graphical session to install? I mean those blue and red menus and buttons that I see in ubuntu-server install
2008-10-14T17:59:00.000Z	jrib	error404notfound	the installer is like the one on the !Alternate CD   (no, no gui)
2009-03-19T16:30:00.000Z	jrib	error404notfound	why do you think it is incorrect?
2009-03-19T16:31:00.000Z	error404notfound	jrib	have a look, 11G is total of / and 9.4 is used. By simple maths almost 1.6G should be free, while I have 0.6G, where is the missing 1G?
2009-03-19T16:31:00.000Z	jrib	error404notfound	are you aware that a percentage of space is reserved for root?  Try with sudo

2009-03-19T16:33:00.000Z	jrib	error404notfound	I could be wrong about df caring whether or not you are root
2009-03-19T16:34:00.000Z	error404notfound	jrib	but system is getting hell slow..
2009-03-19T16:34:00.000Z	jrib	error404notfound	change the amount reserved if you need the space?
2009-03-19T16:35:00.000Z	error404notfound	jrib	how?
2009-03-19T16:35:00.000Z	jrib	error404notfound	with tune2fs as dr_willis said
2009-03-19T17:12:00.000Z	jrib	error404notfound	Accessories -> Disk Usage Analyzer
2009-03-19T17:13:00.000Z	error404notfound	jrib	that would show disk utilization, no software disk usage.
2009-03-19T17:13:00.000Z	jrib	error404notfound	what's the difference?
2009-03-19T17:13:00.000Z	error404notfound	jrib	I meant a software that would show a list of installed software along with there disk consumption
2009-03-19T17:14:00.000Z	jrib	error404notfound	you mean how much space a package takes up?  Maybe synaptic...
2009-03-19T17:14:00.000Z	error404notfound	jrib	nope, I don't see it in there...
2009-03-19T17:15:00.000Z	jrib	error404notfound	right click -> properties on a package.  Your better bet is to use Disk Usage Analyzer, find big files/directories, then use dpkg -S to determine what package is responsible
2009-04-17T18:46:00.000Z	jrib	error404notfound	notice that in his paste on the link you gave he has 3 children processes and no parent listed
