2011-01-07T13:05:00.000Z	maltron		Hi all, I installed ubuntu 10.10 and can't get network access anymore.  The network cable is running through a cicso ip phone, and when I remove the phone DHCP works and all's well.  However both Ubuntu 10.04 and Windows XP work fine.  Any ideas?
2011-01-07T13:06:00.000Z	frogballs	maltron	has it fully updated
2011-01-07T13:08:00.000Z	maltron	frogballs	the OS?  Yeah, the OS is fully loaded, we get a network connection, but then I plug the phone in and it won't work (pc connects to phone, phone connects to wall socket).
2011-01-07T13:08:00.000Z	maltron	frogballs	This problem only occurs with ubuntu 10.10 - 10.04 is fine, as is windows.
2011-01-07T13:09:00.000Z	maltron	frogballs	I tried manually setting the ip address, gateway, netmask and dns and it reported a connection, but in fact I couldn't ping anything, let alone get google on firefox.
2011-01-07T13:13:00.000Z	maltron	frogballs	oh yeah, and yes, the system is up to date, latest system update with kernel and everything.
2011-01-07T13:13:00.000Z	frogballs	maltron	i wonder if it would connect if u ran ubuntu 1010 inside windows
2011-01-07T13:14:00.000Z	maltron	frogballs	you mean as a virtual machine?
2011-01-07T13:14:00.000Z	frogballs	maltron	yes or even wubi or live cd
2011-01-07T13:15:00.000Z	maltron	frogballs	well, the installer (off a cd) didn't detect the network, but I'm running 10.04 off a usb stick and it's fine.  Oh, by the way, it's the AMD-64 version in both cases.
2011-01-07T13:15:00.000Z	maltron	frogballs	Although Windows was 32 bit
2011-01-07T13:16:00.000Z	frogballs	maltron	i used to have wireless issues with some dostros but evertime i am inside windows no issue
2011-01-07T13:17:00.000Z	frogballs	maltron	different issue but it seems like windows drivers can help sometimes
2011-01-07T13:17:00.000Z	maltron	frogballs	I can isolate the problem to this: the connection only occurs on ubuntu 10.10, and only when the phone is connected.  Surely the phone has something to do with it, but I can't for the life of me work out what.  I thought it was because I didn't use the right hostname, but that doesn't matter evidently as 1) I changed it back, 2) I'm using the wrong one off 10.04 on the USB.
2011-01-07T13:18:00.000Z	maltron	frogballs	I think I see - perhaps it's the ethernet driver, you think?
2011-01-07T13:18:00.000Z	frogballs	maltron	well that is my best guess
2011-01-07T13:19:00.000Z	frogballs	maltron	or try some sort of phone update
2011-01-07T13:19:00.000Z	maltron	frogballs	thanks.  Doesn't seem like there's going to be any easy fix, as it's probably a rare setup.
2011-01-07T13:20:00.000Z	maltron	frogballs	Hmm, maybe, although I don't really think I can do that.  IT here (I'm at a university, and I'm new) don't seem to be all that flexible.
2011-01-07T13:20:00.000Z	maltron	frogballs	I'd submit a bug report but I don't know yet that it's a bug, or just a support issue!
2011-01-07T13:21:00.000Z	maltron	frogballs	anyway, thanks for your help.
