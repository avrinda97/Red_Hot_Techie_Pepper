2011-08-11T00:30:00.000Z	edbian	noneabove1182_	gksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
2011-08-11T00:31:00.000Z	edbian	noneabove1182_	yes
2011-08-11T00:31:00.000Z	edbian	noneabove1182_	That opens a text editor (gedit) as root gksudo
2011-08-11T00:32:00.000Z	edbian	noneabove1182_	probably just garabage from gedit
