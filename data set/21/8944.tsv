2006-02-28T17:44:00.000Z	wickers		anyone here use espresso yet?
2006-02-28T17:44:00.000Z	odla	wickers	yes
2006-02-28T17:44:00.000Z	odla	wickers	i installed ubuntu from the live cd...so pretty good...but if you're a newbie i would wait a bit
2006-02-28T17:44:00.000Z	odla	wickers	there are some quirks
2006-02-28T17:45:00.000Z	wickers	odla	not a noobie, what sort of quirks?
2006-02-28T17:45:00.000Z	odla	wickers	i had to use gparted several times to actually get my partitions set up
2006-02-28T17:45:00.000Z	wickers	odla	will it use a pre-partitioned drive?
2006-02-28T17:45:00.000Z	odla	wickers	but once i got everything set up right...it installed with no hitch
2006-02-28T17:46:00.000Z	odla	wickers	sure...you'll need to tell it which ones are the / and the /swap
2006-02-28T17:46:00.000Z	odla	wickers	though it might autodetect those for you
2006-02-28T17:46:00.000Z	wickers	odla	then it sounds good to me. :)
2006-02-28T17:46:00.000Z	odla	wickers	after gparted, which is the default partitioning tool with espresso, the install went smoothly and it installed quicker than the debian installer
2006-02-28T17:47:00.000Z	odla	wickers	very impressed...also you'll need to remove some meta packages and espresso once you've installed it cause you won't need espresso once it's installed to your hard drive and the ubuntu-live metapackage can go
2006-02-28T17:47:00.000Z	odla	wickers	for dapper chat...btw....use #ubuntu+1
2006-02-28T17:48:00.000Z	odla	wickers	it was nice to install dapper while chatting on irc from the live cd on the same computer
2006-02-28T17:48:00.000Z	wickers	odla	yeah I know, ;)
2006-02-28T17:49:00.000Z	wickers	odla	Yeah but you can also bootstrap Debian from a running liveCD too... or do a gentoo install from knoppix...
2006-02-28T17:49:00.000Z	odla	wickers	yeah i know i've just never used a live cd install usually just do it the old fashion way
2006-02-28T17:50:00.000Z	wickers	odla	it's nifty...
2006-02-28T17:50:00.000Z	odla	wickers	ha ha
2006-02-28T17:50:00.000Z	odla	wickers	and dapper seems pretty stable right now
