2005-05-05T05:05:00.000Z	Turtlewind		a dumb question about USB disks:
2005-05-05T05:05:00.000Z	Turtlewind		I have a USB drive that Linux doesn't detect, although Windows 2k/XP and MacOSX find it automatically
2005-05-05T05:05:00.000Z	Turtlewind		I've been told that I can mount it manually
2005-05-05T05:05:00.000Z	Turtlewind		but the MAN files for the mount command are pretty arcane
2005-05-05T05:06:00.000Z	Turtlewind		so can someone give me a simple summary of how to mount a USB drive that Ubuntu doesn't find on its own?
2005-05-05T05:08:00.000Z	Tuxicity	Turtlewind	not sure at all, but i'll try...
2005-05-05T05:08:00.000Z	Tuxicity	Turtlewind	goto System --> System --> Device Manager
2005-05-05T05:09:00.000Z	Tuxicity	Turtlewind	find your HDD in the list of devices on the left
2005-05-05T05:09:00.000Z	Tuxicity	Turtlewind	click on it
2005-05-05T05:09:00.000Z	Tuxicity	Turtlewind	in the right pane, select the Advanced tab
2005-05-05T05:10:00.000Z	Tuxicity	Turtlewind	check what block device it is e.g. /dev/hda
2005-05-05T05:10:00.000Z	Tuxicity	Turtlewind	BTW I am not familiar with USB drives, so im just guessing... but it might work
2005-05-05T05:11:00.000Z	Tuxicity	Turtlewind	ok now you know it's called /dev/hda or something
2005-05-05T05:11:00.000Z	Tuxicity	Turtlewind	open the terminal (console) and type this...
2005-05-05T05:12:00.000Z	Tuxicity	Turtlewind	sudo mkdir /media/my_usb_drive
2005-05-05T05:14:00.000Z	Tuxicity	Turtlewind	sudo mount -t usbfs /dev/hda /media/my_usb_drive
2005-05-05T05:16:00.000Z	Turtlewind	Tuxicity	- thanks a lot!
2005-05-05T05:16:00.000Z	Tuxicity	Turtlewind	as ive said, never tested myself,
2005-05-05T05:17:00.000Z	Tuxicity	Turtlewind	so 1)find out how the device is called
2005-05-05T05:17:00.000Z	Tuxicity	Turtlewind	and 2) mount it - the type is usbfs
2005-05-05T05:17:00.000Z	Tuxicity	Turtlewind	and you're welcome, friend :)
