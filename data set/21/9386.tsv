2006-05-27T13:00:00.000Z	rajeev	tuxtheslacker	how to check that??
2006-05-27T13:02:00.000Z	rajeev	tuxtheslacker	can u tell me how to check for the sound card support? plz tell me i m new user of LINUX
2006-05-27T13:03:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	rajeev	look for alsa, and look at the supported sound cards.
2006-05-27T13:03:00.000Z	rajeev	tuxtheslacker	plz tell me..
2006-05-27T13:04:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	rajeev	I don't know...
2006-05-27T13:04:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	rajeev	you have to look...
2006-05-27T13:05:00.000Z	rajeev	tuxtheslacker	i got this result while checking for ALSA in Multimedia system selector Failed to construct test pipeline for 'ALSA - Advanced Linux Sound Architecture'
2006-05-27T13:06:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	rajeev	then your alsa is broken....
2006-05-27T13:06:00.000Z	rajeev	tuxtheslacker	So what to do to fix that??
2006-05-27T13:06:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	rajeev	reinstall alsa?
2006-05-27T13:07:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	rajeev	it looks like you've got a broken package or an unsupported card.
2006-05-27T13:07:00.000Z	rajeev	tuxtheslacker	sorry to ask but how??? :(
2006-05-27T13:07:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	rajeev	to be honest, I've not done it myself... someone else here would be of better service...
2006-05-27T13:08:00.000Z	rajeev	tuxtheslacker	ok did u know some one who can help me..
2006-05-27T13:38:00.000Z	rajeev	tuxtheslacker	 i think the main problem is that my sound card is not getting detected.. so can u tell me what to do???
