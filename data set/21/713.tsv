2011-07-18T17:20:00.000Z	Monotoko	Reikoku	I need a mac >.>
2011-07-18T17:21:00.000Z	Reikoku	Monotoko	You don't, trust me
2011-07-18T17:21:00.000Z	Monotoko	Reikoku	I have always wanted to start iOS development...even tried to get a VM going but without much success :P
2011-07-18T17:22:00.000Z	Reikoku	Monotoko	I used to have Xcode 3 working on hackintosh
2011-07-18T17:23:00.000Z	Reikoku	Monotoko	Objective C is pretty nice to write
2011-07-18T17:34:00.000Z	Reikoku	Monotoko	Ubuntu 10.04 should run on a 2003 laptop :S
2011-07-18T17:35:00.000Z	Monotoko	Reikoku	not well I suspect... brahmana, you may want to try DSL or some other "small" distribution
2011-07-18T17:36:00.000Z	Reikoku	Monotoko	Isn't Ubuntu 10.04 gnome3 based?
2011-07-18T17:36:00.000Z	Monotoko	Reikoku	no it's Gnome2
2011-07-18T17:36:00.000Z	Reikoku	Monotoko	gnome2 will run on 03 hardware
2011-07-18T17:37:00.000Z	Monotoko	Reikoku	it all depends...it sounds like 10.04 doesn't know or support his video card
2011-07-18T17:38:00.000Z	Monotoko	Reikoku	perhaps...but xubuntu may support it better as it is designed for older computers
2011-07-18T17:39:00.000Z	Reikoku	Monotoko	Yeah he'd probably be better with xubuntu
2011-07-18T17:39:00.000Z	Monotoko	Reikoku	perhaps..but rather than going the long way around, he might as well just install xubuntu? http://www.xubuntu.org/
2011-07-18T17:40:00.000Z	Reikoku	Monotoko	I haven't used xubuntu, I don't know its nuances
2011-07-18T17:40:00.000Z	Monotoko	Reikoku	it isn't..I've used it to bring ancient computers back to life a lot :P
2011-07-18T17:41:00.000Z	Reikoku	Monotoko	I haven't used LINUX for a while, tbh :P
