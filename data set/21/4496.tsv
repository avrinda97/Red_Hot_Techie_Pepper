2012-04-24T06:07:00.000Z	J2		Can anyone help?
2012-04-24T06:08:00.000Z	gmachine_24	J2	- what version of Ubuntu?
2012-04-24T06:09:00.000Z	gmachine_24	J2	- right. If you have flash with downloading isos and what not try SuperGrub2 http://www.supergrubdisk.org/
2012-04-24T06:10:00.000Z	gmachine_24	J2	- boot from the CD. You can choose from the options and it will recreate your grub info including windows
2012-04-24T06:11:00.000Z	gmachine_24	J2	- no blank CDs? Yes, I suppose you can write the iso to a DVD as long as your computer will read from a DVD when booting.
2012-04-24T06:12:00.000Z	J2	gmachine_24	it does. Alright, i'll burn it real quick, and be back once i get it booted
2012-04-24T06:14:00.000Z	gmachine_24	J2	- it should work. Always has for me. Just make sure to get the SuperGrub2 .......
2012-04-24T06:14:00.000Z	gmachine_24	J2	and then buy some CDs.
2012-04-24T06:15:00.000Z	J2	gmachine_24	how do i use the SuperGRUB? Does it go on the same cd as the Distro?
2012-04-24T06:17:00.000Z	gmachine_24	J2	- no, you download the superGrub2 (not supergrub which is the first version) and burn it to a cd/dvd. then you boot from that cd/dvd and you will have a menu to choose from - one will be to restore grub2
2012-04-24T06:18:00.000Z	gmachine_24	J2	- but it needs to go on a previously blank cd/dvd
2012-04-24T06:31:00.000Z	J2	gmachine_24	superGrub2 couldn't possibly be put on a thumb drive...could it?
2012-04-24T06:31:00.000Z	gmachine_24	J2	- I have no idea.
2012-04-24T06:51:00.000Z	gmachine_24	J2	- what options does the menu give you?
2012-04-24T06:51:00.000Z	J2	gmachine_24	Im in the ubuntu live cd.someone said to use it
2012-04-24T06:52:00.000Z	gmachine_24	J2	- you need to boot from the SuperGrub2 disc.
2012-04-24T06:52:00.000Z	gmachine_24	J2	not the ubuntu disc
2012-04-24T06:53:00.000Z	J2	gmachine_24	Is the GRUB what is broken on my install? I may have not been clear what the issue was.
2012-04-24T06:54:00.000Z	gmachine_24	J2	- please just boot from the SuperGrub2 CD/DVD that you burned.
2012-04-24T07:09:00.000Z	J2	gmachine_24	In superGRUMPB
2012-04-24T07:11:00.000Z	gmachine_24	J2	- click on the separate window so we can talk without using up the main window
