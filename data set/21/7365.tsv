2006-10-15T12:15:00.000Z	soundray	YOKcom	sudo su is not recommended. Open the file with sudo nano filename or similar

2006-10-15T12:39:00.000Z	soundray	YOKcom	it says on the bottom of the screen. Ctrl-O to write out, Ctrl-X to exit.

2006-10-15T12:51:00.000Z	soundray	YOKcom	will have a look later. Putting daughter to bed now.
2006-10-15T13:11:00.000Z	soundray	YOKcom	do you actually have that particular laptop model?
2006-10-15T13:11:00.000Z	YOKcom	soundray	yes i do
2006-10-15T13:11:00.000Z	YOKcom	soundray	i edited the xorg.conf already i'm on the second part now
2006-10-15T13:12:00.000Z	soundray	YOKcom	what's the second part? Where it says "Kubuntu..."?
2006-10-15T13:12:00.000Z	YOKcom	soundray	go a little up its in installing ubuntu dapper
2006-10-15T13:13:00.000Z	YOKcom	soundray	[On my UXGA t60p the ChipID line was actually fatal to getting fglrx to start up (/var/log/Xorg.0.log showed the driver falling back to VESA and fgl_glxgears would crash). Without that ChipID line my chip was identified as
2006-10-15T13:13:00.000Z	YOKcom	soundray	that line
2006-10-15T13:15:00.000Z	soundray	YOKcom	what it says is that you may or may not need the ChipID line in xorg.conf. Is it in your current one?
2006-10-15T13:15:00.000Z	YOKcom	soundray	let me check
2006-10-15T13:16:00.000Z	YOKcom	soundray	it says ChipID 0x71c5
2006-10-15T13:19:00.000Z	soundray	YOKcom	okay. Now you should be able to reboot and get a graphical login. *If* you don't, you'll have to login on a text console, run 'sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf' and add a # so it says #ChipID, and then run 'sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart'.
2006-10-15T13:20:00.000Z	YOKcom	soundray	I got the graphical login. The reason I tried to follow that guide is because of laggyness on splash screens. I thought it would help it but it still happens. =/
