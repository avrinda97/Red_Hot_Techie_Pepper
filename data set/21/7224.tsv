2006-12-07T16:10:00.000Z	tylerl		I'm going to be doing a lot of telnet'ing.  What is a good client to do this (other than terminal)
2006-12-07T16:11:00.000Z	niekie	tylerl	I'd consider doing it through command-line is the best way.
2006-12-07T16:11:00.000Z	niekie		You could try PuTTY if you really do not want to use command line.
2006-12-07T16:11:00.000Z	niekie		Though.. it is not much different..
2006-12-07T16:12:00.000Z	tylerl	niekie	The reason I ask is because when I was using Telnet on a portal I have, every time I hit delete it would put a strange character...
2006-12-07T16:12:00.000Z	tylerl	niekie	Any clue why that would be, or how to fix that?
2006-12-07T16:13:00.000Z	niekie	tylerl	I think I might know.
2006-12-07T16:13:00.000Z	niekie		One second.
2006-12-07T16:13:00.000Z	tylerl	niekie	okay :)
2006-12-07T16:15:00.000Z	niekie	tylerl	you can configure what the terminal generates on backspace.
2006-12-07T16:15:00.000Z	niekie		At least, with gnome-terminal
2006-12-07T16:16:00.000Z	tylerl	niekie	It only does that when I telnet... but its still configurable?
2006-12-07T16:17:00.000Z	niekie	tylerl	I am not sure.
2006-12-07T16:17:00.000Z	tylerl	niekie	k
2006-12-07T16:17:00.000Z	niekie		You could also try using netcat instead of telnet.
2006-12-07T16:18:00.000Z	tylerl	niekie	Got it in options, thanks.
2006-12-07T16:20:00.000Z	tylerl	niekie	Is it possible to configure an application to open on the push of a button... ie: If I push f12, terminal opens.?
2006-12-07T16:23:00.000Z	tylerl		How do you configure a button to open an application?
2006-12-07T16:25:00.000Z	niekie	tylerl	yes.
2006-12-07T16:26:00.000Z	niekie	tylerl	I think it's in System Preferences under hotkey setup.
2006-12-07T16:26:00.000Z	tylerl	niekie	Thanks
