2006-10-11T16:37:00.000Z	capitalidea		I just installed swiftfox using the AMD64 deb provided on its homepage, but when I try to run swiftfox what actually happens is that firefox is started. :-(
2006-10-11T16:37:00.000Z	oskude	capitalidea	whats swiftfox ?
2006-10-11T16:38:00.000Z	oskude	capitalidea	and did they have ubuntu dapper packages ?
2006-10-11T16:39:00.000Z	capitalidea	oskude	I don't believe so.
2006-10-11T16:39:00.000Z	oskude	capitalidea	well ...
2006-10-11T16:40:00.000Z	capitalidea	oskude	well...?
2006-10-11T16:40:00.000Z	oskude	capitalidea	if they dont have ubuntu dapper packages, youre only hope is to compile it yourself...
2006-10-11T16:41:00.000Z	capitalidea	oskude	Why is that? What is wrong with the deb?
2006-10-11T16:41:00.000Z	oskude	capitalidea	it has to be for ubuntu dapper !
2006-10-11T16:41:00.000Z	capitalidea	oskude	Why? I'm fishing for the technical details here...
2006-10-11T16:42:00.000Z	oskude	capitalidea	can you install windows xp programs on windows 3.1 ?
2006-10-11T16:42:00.000Z	capitalidea	oskude	Is Ubuntu no longer based on Debian?
2006-10-11T16:42:00.000Z	oskude	capitalidea	ubuntu dapper != ubuntu breezy != debian what ever
2006-10-11T16:43:00.000Z	oskude	capitalidea	yeah its BASED on debian, but its NOT debian
2006-10-11T16:43:00.000Z	oskude	capitalidea	linux is just the kernel
2006-10-11T16:45:00.000Z	oskude	capitalidea	well, you just have to accept that ubuntu != debian, when it comes to install debian debs...
2006-10-11T16:53:00.000Z	capitalidea	oskude	Apparently, if firefox is already open, swiftfox just opens another window of firefox... - on the flip side of that, the swiftfox deb works flawlessly
2006-10-11T05:00:00.000Z	oskude	capitalidea	then things is, debian (may) have different versions of librarys on what a program depends.
2006-10-11T05:01:00.000Z	oskude	capitalidea	thats the same case why you (mostly) cant even install dapper debs on breezy
2006-10-11T05:02:00.000Z	oskude	capitalidea	and lets say a program depends on package foo12 on debian, but on ubuntu its called foo12-ubuntu1, how is that gonna work ?
2006-10-11T05:07:00.000Z	oskude	capitalidea	and you have to update that package manually...
