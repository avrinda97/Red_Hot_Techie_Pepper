2007-07-14T14:36:00.000Z	hypertyper	iambob	there is a better way... or rather, there is a way to play wow without installing xp
2007-07-14T14:37:00.000Z	hypertyper	iambob	use your browser to search for "howto wow <your distro here>"
2007-07-14T14:37:00.000Z	hypertyper	iambob	for instance, i am running ubuntu, so i searched for "howto wow ubuntu"
2007-07-14T14:37:00.000Z	iambob	hypertyper	if it is using a windows emulator i have tried that it says cannot use 3d accelorator or something like that
2007-07-14T14:38:00.000Z	hypertyper	iambob	what video card do you have in the machine?
2007-07-14T14:39:00.000Z	iambob	hypertyper	its a i810 series
2007-07-14T14:39:00.000Z	iambob	hypertyper	i have played wow on it before i installed ubuntu
2007-07-14T14:40:00.000Z	hypertyper	iambob	check the wow website for system requirements. you may not be able to play wow with that video card. alternatively, someone else here may be able to help you get an updated driver
2007-07-14T14:40:00.000Z	hypertyper	iambob	i know there are some video cards that do not work - particularly integrated video cards such as the intel chipset cards, and the chrome
2007-07-14T14:41:00.000Z	iambob	hypertyper	i have played wow with it i meet all requirments
2007-07-14T14:42:00.000Z	hypertyper	iambob	then it may be a driver issue, or you may need to install xp. if you are going to install xp, i recommend downloading the "Super Grub Disk" beforehand, as it will make reinstalling grub much simpler after xp cheerfully breaks it for you
2007-07-14T14:43:00.000Z	iambob	hypertyper	were do i find that
2007-07-14T14:44:00.000Z	hypertyper	iambob	use your favorite search engine, look for "super grub disk"
2007-07-14T14:44:00.000Z	iambob	hypertyper	yea it broke my friends we think he has to reinstall ubuntu completly
2007-07-14T14:45:00.000Z	hypertyper	iambob	you'll need a blank cd, and a way to put an iso on it. instructions are provided on the website for doing so in linux
2007-07-14T14:46:00.000Z	iambob	hypertyper	can u tell me what i am doing wrong in installing windows xp i keep going to gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
2007-07-14T14:48:00.000Z	hypertyper	iambob	i'm not sure i understand your question... is xp already installed?
2007-07-14T14:48:00.000Z	iambob	hypertyper	no im trying to get it installed using the second hd as a disk instead of what it really is
2007-07-14T14:49:00.000Z	hypertyper	iambob	then i'm not sure what grub has to do with it.
2007-07-14T14:49:00.000Z	hypertyper	iambob	it might be best to acquire a windows xp install cd, and use that to install... there's something to be said for having legit software ;)
2007-07-14T14:50:00.000Z	iambob	hypertyper	 it sets it as something i boot from like a cd instead of hardrive
