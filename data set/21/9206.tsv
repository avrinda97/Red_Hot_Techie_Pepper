2005-10-23T07:54:00.000Z	photomatt		matt from wordpress here, could anyone point me in the direction of getting ubuntu to recognize more than 4 GB of memory?
2005-10-23T07:55:00.000Z	robotgeek	photomatt	hi, great job on wordpress. does your motherboard support it?
2005-10-23T07:56:00.000Z	photomatt	robotgeek	thanks! we had freebsd on the box before and that recognized all 8gb, if that answers your question
2005-10-23T08:00:00.000Z	robotgeek	photomatt	is it a 32 bit or 64 bit?
2005-10-23T08:02:00.000Z	photomatt	robotgeek	64-bit xeons
2005-10-23T08:02:00.000Z	robotgeek	photomatt	and are you running a smp kernel, uname -a
2005-10-23T08:04:00.000Z	photomatt	robotgeek	uname -a returns: Linux db2.wordpress.com 2.6.12-9-386 #1 Tue Oct 4 18:44:03 BST 2005 i686 GNU/Linux
2005-10-23T08:05:00.000Z	robotgeek	photomatt	i think it's not seeing only 4GB of memory as you are running a 32 bit kernel. try getting a 64 bit kernel, and you should be fine
2005-10-23T08:06:00.000Z	photomatt	robotgeek	I'll try that, thank you very much!
2005-10-23T08:07:00.000Z	robotgeek	photomatt	np :)
2005-10-23T08:07:00.000Z	photomatt	robotgeek	if you want an invite to wordpress.com or anything, let me know
2005-10-23T08:08:00.000Z	robotgeek	photomatt	already have one, http://robotgeek.wordpress.com
2005-10-23T08:09:00.000Z	robotgeek	photomatt	thanks to carthik -> nalioth :)
2005-10-23T08:09:00.000Z	photomatt	robotgeek	awesome. :)
2005-10-23T08:21:00.000Z	photomatt	robotgeek	nope, this is on a remote server, all I have is shell
2005-10-23T08:11:00.000Z	robotgeek	photomatt	let me know if it works :)
2005-10-23T08:20:00.000Z	robotgeek	photomatt	are u using a live cd, if so try the AMD-64 cd. (i belive it would work if your xeon's have EM64T extension). I am not sure what it means, i've never used a 64bit os :)
2005-10-23T08:22:00.000Z	robotgeek	photomatt	hmm, so are u doing a netinstall?
2005-10-23T08:22:00.000Z	photomatt	robotgeek	someone else installed it, I'm just trying to make it work now
2005-10-23T08:23:00.000Z	robotgeek	photomatt	oh okay, then you might have to do a kernel recompile. i think
2005-10-23T08:24:00.000Z	robotgeek	photomatt	or install the amd-64 version of ubuntu
