2009-07-10T22:03:00.000Z	scunizi	dyf	did you just install?
2009-07-10T22:03:00.000Z	dyf	scunizi	yes, just a few minutes ago
2009-07-10T22:04:00.000Z	scunizi	dyf	is there an update icon up by the clock?
2009-07-10T22:04:00.000Z	scunizi	dyf	doh.. sorry
2009-07-10T22:04:00.000Z	dyf	scunizi	no
2009-07-10T22:04:00.000Z	scunizi	dyf	go to applications>accessories>terminal.. we'll do a quick test
2009-07-10T22:04:00.000Z	dyf	scunizi	ok, what next?
2009-07-10T22:05:00.000Z	scunizi	dyf	type this exactly  or ctrl+c then paste into it.. .. sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2009-07-10T22:06:00.000Z	dyf	scunizi	everything is up to date
2009-07-10T22:06:00.000Z	scunizi	dyf	k.. look in System>Admin>Hardware drivers.. is there a driver there to activate?
2009-07-10T22:06:00.000Z	dyf	scunizi	no, it searches but doesn't seem to find anything
2009-07-10T22:07:00.000Z	scunizi	dyf	open System>Admin>synatpic package manager and search for nvidia.. see what is currently installed
2009-07-10T22:10:00.000Z	dyf	scunizi	this is what's installed: www.imagebin.org/55461
2009-07-10T22:11:00.000Z	scunizi	dyf	after your initial update did you restart X or the machine?
2009-07-10T22:11:00.000Z	dyf	scunizi	yes, i restarted the machine
2009-07-10T22:11:00.000Z	scunizi	dyf	this is 9.04 or an earlier version?
2009-07-10T22:12:00.000Z	dyf	scunizi	9.04
2009-07-10T22:13:00.000Z	scunizi	dyf	strange.. go ahead and install the nvidia-settings program
2009-07-10T22:19:00.000Z	dyf	scunizi	www.imagebin.org/55463
2009-07-10T22:23:00.000Z	scunizi	dyf	beyond this I'm stuck.. the 6600 is a well supported card.. on my system I typically use the driver direct from nvidia.. but you won't need that with your card.  I'm not good at diagnosing why the driver isn't showing up as an option.. xorg.conf won't show much either.
2009-07-10T22:25:00.000Z	scunizi	dyf	you could check /etc/X11/xorg.conf and see if a driver is listed in there.. doubt it but if there is one then you could change it to nv for the generic or nvidia for the propriatory one .. save and restart X to activate
