2007-06-19T09:47:00.000Z	tomplast		Hi everyone. Is there anyone who can help me find a working usb tv capturing device that works with GNU/Linux?
2007-06-19T09:49:00.000Z	soundray	tomplast	it's difficult to know before you've tried. Internals tend to change while model names stay the same.
2007-06-19T09:49:00.000Z	tomplast	soundray	Do you have tried any?
2007-06-19T09:50:00.000Z	soundray	tomplast	I've tried a noname device with a Dibcom chipset which works with kernel 2.6.18 and above
2007-06-19T09:50:00.000Z	soundray	tomplast	I've also tried the MSI-580 (most popular one at the moment I believe), which doesn't work so well.
2007-06-19T09:51:00.000Z	tomplast	soundray	Okay. I guess I will go for a            TerraTec Cinergy T USB XE which will maybe work (according to some...).
2007-06-19T09:51:00.000Z	tomplast	soundray	I think Linux really needs a good hardware compatabillity list which list distribution/kernel for each hardware *-)
2007-06-19T09:51:00.000Z	soundray	tomplast	perhaps you can order from a dealer who will give you a no-quibbles exchange
2007-06-19T09:52:00.000Z	tomplast	soundray	Perhaps but it's so little money *-). About 20
2007-06-19T09:52:00.000Z	soundray	tomplast	start compiling one, and you will soon learn why there isn't any ;)
2007-06-19T09:52:00.000Z	tomplast	soundray	compiling one?
2007-06-19T09:52:00.000Z	tomplast	soundray	I thought something like a user contributed hardware site.
2007-06-19T09:52:00.000Z	soundray	tomplast	compiling, as in gathering information (not the gcc sense)
2007-06-19T09:53:00.000Z	soundray	tomplast	something like tuxmobil for laptops?
2007-06-19T09:53:00.000Z	tomplast	soundray	I know that there are some out there but I would like one universal. For all Linux versions. All kernel versions/distributions.
2007-06-19T09:54:00.000Z	tomplast	soundray	Tell me about one... Which aint just for one thing (like laptops)
2007-06-19T09:54:00.000Z	tomplast	soundray	Which is universal.
2007-06-19T09:54:00.000Z	tomplast	soundray	Translated...
2007-06-19T09:54:00.000Z	soundray	tomplast	I don't know any. Back on your original question, I found this: http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page
2007-06-19T09:55:00.000Z	tomplast	soundray	Yeah but it's only for TV-related hardware. I thought something more complete which contains storage devices, network cards, sound cards, graphics cards etc.
2007-06-19T09:58:00.000Z	tomplast	soundray	Right now you'll have to search round and around in different databases to find something reliable, I don't say that Linux support is bad but I think the knowledge of which works and doesn't works should be contained in ONE database. I really hope something makes the move one day. Anyway, thanks for your help.
