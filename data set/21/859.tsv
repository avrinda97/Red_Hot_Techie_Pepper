2011-05-06T10:29:00.000Z	Snicers-Home		is ubottu an irc bot?
2011-05-06T10:29:00.000Z	ohsix	Snicers-Home	yep
2011-05-06T10:25:00.000Z	ohsix	Snicers-Home	you can use smartctl to tell your drive to do surface scans and things, do that first; there's a log that tells you where failures are
2011-05-06T10:25:00.000Z	Snicers-Home	ohsix	thanks
2011-05-06T10:26:00.000Z	ohsix	Snicers-Home	then theres badblocks, which can be dangerous in the presence of an actual damaged disk
2011-05-06T10:26:00.000Z	Snicers-Home	ohsix	why is that dangerous?
2011-05-06T10:26:00.000Z	ohsix	Snicers-Home	and you probably want to check out gddrescue too, in the face of disk damage it can help you copy what can be recovered
2011-05-06T10:27:00.000Z	ohsix	Snicers-Home	because badblocks can be told to rewrite what it reads to disk, which can damage the filesystem when you don't intend to do that
2011-05-06T10:35:00.000Z	ohsix	Snicers-Home	dpkg -L packagename
2011-05-06T10:35:00.000Z	ohsix	Snicers-Home	that's post install but it will show the location of every file in a given package
2011-05-06T10:35:00.000Z	Snicers-Home	ohsix	perfect, thank you.
2011-05-06T10:37:00.000Z	ohsix	Snicers-Home	theres no practical difference if you're just installing things, they all call dpkg to do the work; aptitude gives you a list of packages, changes, and all possible package resolutions, and you can read the changelogs for a package easily
2011-05-06T10:41:00.000Z	ohsix	Snicers-Home	not in a way that is supported, you'd have to do it all yourself and replace the bootloader, which might not be able to be done depending on the phone & bootloader version, i can say with confidence that you almost for sure don't want to do it anyways
2011-05-06T10:41:00.000Z	ohsix	Snicers-Home	you can get a board with omap4 and try the new stuff in natty though :D
2011-05-06T10:51:00.000Z	ohsix	Snicers-Home	it shouldn't have, what is it saying? all tasksel does is install some virtuals iirc; but does it with a lower "question" threshold so you can configure the packages a bit more
2011-05-06T10:52:00.000Z	Snicers-Home	ohsix	it just says Aptitude failed and drops me back into standard black/white terminal
2011-05-06T10:52:00.000Z	ohsix	Snicers-Home	do you have another package manager open?
2011-05-06T10:53:00.000Z	Snicers-Home	ohsix	No, I run terminal only mode for my servers at work.
2011-05-06T10:56:00.000Z	ohsix	Snicers-Home	not practically
2011-05-06T10:56:00.000Z	Snicers-Home	ohsix	why is it not practical?
2011-05-06T10:58:00.000Z	ohsix	Snicers-Home	because you probably wouldn't like what you get when you do it :D and vm's are generally involved
