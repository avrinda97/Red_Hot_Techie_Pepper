2008-02-21T08:36:00.000Z	nickrud	karllenz	the libraries that draw the stuff inside the window borders
2008-04-24T09:25:00.000Z	nickrud	karllenz	if you get to that, it's booting in the normal mode, just the X server is not starting. What kind of video card do you have?
2008-04-24T09:25:00.000Z	nickrud	karllenz	need to know exactly
2008-04-24T09:25:00.000Z	nickrud	karllenz	  lspci | grep -i vga  in a terminal will tell you
2008-04-24T09:27:00.000Z	nickrud	karllenz	tell it to unload the applet
2008-04-24T09:29:00.000Z	nickrud	karllenz	not sure what driver provides support for that chip, try googling  ubuntu via vt8378
2008-04-24T09:32:00.000Z	nickrud	karllenz	welcome then. There's only a few things you'll need to know, you'll pick them up as you go

2008-04-24T09:33:00.000Z	karllenz	nickrud	do u thin the s3 driver will work
2008-04-24T09:34:00.000Z	nickrud	karllenz	my guess would be xserver-xorg-video-via  or  -unichrome , but I don't have any experience with via chips
2008-04-24T09:35:00.000Z	karllenz	nickrud	that did the trick
2008-04-24T09:35:00.000Z	karllenz	nickrud	 the s3 driver

2008-04-24T09:37:00.000Z	nickrud	karllenz	no, just wait till hardy is released. Your ubuntu will offer to upgrade without reinstalling
2008-04-24T09:38:00.000Z	karllenz	nickrud	im new to linux and ubuntu should i wait before doing any updates as well??
2008-04-24T09:39:00.000Z	nickrud	karllenz	no, you should be totally up to date before upgrading to the next release. Actually, the upgrade will ensure you're up to date before it begins
2008-04-24T09:39:00.000Z	karllenz	nickrud	o ok
2008-04-24T09:45:00.000Z	nickrud	karllenz	it tells the package management to run the install configuration steps for any packages that haven't finished configuring
2008-04-24T09:46:00.000Z	karllenz	nickrud	o ok
