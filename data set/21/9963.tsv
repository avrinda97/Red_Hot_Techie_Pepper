2005-10-27T11:01:00.000Z	Avinoam		Anything to do besides for reinstalling ubuntu?
2005-10-27T11:01:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	Avinoam	what is the problem you are having?
2005-10-27T11:02:00.000Z	Avinoam	HiddenWolf	I changed swap from primary to logical partition using knoppix... changed the fstab... and now ubuntu won't boot
2005-10-27T11:02:00.000Z	Avinoam	HiddenWolf	and Windows won't boot either
2005-10-27T11:03:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	Avinoam	farily old knoppix i presume?
2005-10-27T11:03:00.000Z	Avinoam	HiddenWolf	brand new knoppix
2005-10-27T11:04:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	Avinoam	it's probably best to pop in a windows cd, run fixmbr, then pop in an ubuntu livecd, chroot to your ubuntu install, and run grub-install
2005-10-27T11:04:00.000Z	Avinoam	HiddenWolf	you think it's a grub issue?
2005-10-27T11:04:00.000Z	Avinoam	HiddenWolf	Grub works, i think
2005-10-27T11:05:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	Avinoam	knoppix messed up the partition data, so windows can't find itself, (it's fairly stupid) Hopefully fixmbr can fix windows.
2005-10-27T11:05:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	Avinoam	after that, you need a livecd to get to your ubuntu harddisk, and try to figure out if it's saveable.
2005-10-27T11:06:00.000Z	Avinoam	HiddenWolf	ok, i'll do the fixmbr thing... and then I'll run grub-install on knoppix... does that sound good?
2005-10-27T11:06:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	Avinoam	no, please stay away from knoppix, only use it to chroot into your ubuntu disk, if at all possible.
2005-10-27T11:07:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	Avinoam	this is the kind of problem that is hard to debug, so we'd need exact error messages, and even then it's guessing.
2005-10-27T11:07:00.000Z	Avinoam	HiddenWolf	chrooting shouldn't be a problem
2005-10-27T11:07:00.000Z	Avinoam	HiddenWolf	I'm gonna reset the mbr and then come back here
2005-10-27T11:07:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	Avinoam	good.
2005-10-27T11:07:00.000Z	Avinoam	HiddenWolf	it's a shame that you can't reinstall grub using the ubuntu installation CD
2005-10-27T11:08:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	Avinoam	we're revamping the system for the next release.
2005-10-27T11:08:00.000Z	Avinoam	HiddenWolf	i'm glad to hear
2005-10-27T11:08:00.000Z	Avinoam	HiddenWolf	i'll be back in a few
