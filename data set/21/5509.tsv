2010-07-10T13:00:00.000Z	usacomputertec		hello I'm trying to compile and install x264 or h264 whatever you want to call it. When I try to do it I get this error: /usr/bin/ld: cannot open output file x264: Is a directory
2010-07-10T13:00:00.000Z	usacomputertec		collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
2010-07-10T13:00:00.000Z	usacomputertec		make: *** [x264] Error 1
2010-07-10T13:00:00.000Z	usacomputertec		 So what do I do now?
2010-07-10T13:01:00.000Z	usacomputertec		I can't find the x264 directory it's talking about. I don't know where it is.
2010-07-10T13:01:00.000Z	usacomputertec		anyone?
2010-07-10T13:02:00.000Z	usacomputertec		Mark-I saw that
2010-07-10T13:02:00.000Z	bazhang	usacomputertec	there is no need to compile it
2010-07-10T13:02:00.000Z	usacomputertec	bazhang	yes there is. KDENLIVE won't use it unless you compile it yourself
2010-07-10T13:02:00.000Z	bazhang	usacomputertec	which version? works here for me
2010-07-10T13:03:00.000Z	usacomputertec		According to everywhere on the internet the problem lies with a legal problem that Ubuntu can't put certain things in the package they have for h264
2010-07-10T13:03:00.000Z	bazhang	usacomputertec	you should explain what you are trying to do first of all
2010-07-10T13:03:00.000Z	usacomputertec		I can't render h264 no matter what I do. The guy here had the same problem. He had to do this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1117283

2010-07-10T13:04:00.000Z	usacomputertec	bazhang	that's what I'm trying to do
2010-07-10T13:04:00.000Z	usacomputertec		for Ubuntu 9.10
2010-07-10T13:04:00.000Z	bazhang	usacomputertec	do what?
2010-07-10T13:04:00.000Z	usacomputertec	bazhang	the instructions at that link
2010-07-10T13:05:00.000Z	usacomputertec	bazhang	according to every forum I've found following those instructions is my only way to make KDENLIVE do what I want. I've got every codec able to render except h264
2010-07-10T13:06:00.000Z	bazhang		autoconf-archive, texlive-binaries jacobian
2010-07-10T13:06:00.000Z	usacomputertec	bazhang	do you understand yet?
