2006-10-19T05:44:00.000Z	soundray	loquitus_of_borg	looks bad. Better back up your data and order a new hard disk.
2006-10-19T05:46:00.000Z	loquitus_of_borg	soundray	so this is a physical thing... I can't just reformat and hope that reformatting would mark the bad sectors away?
2006-10-19T05:47:00.000Z	soundray	loquitus_of_borg	you could do that, but I personally tend to get jittery at the slightest sign of disk trouble.
2006-10-19T05:48:00.000Z	soundray	loquitus_of_borg	I'd rather spend a couple extra hours working for money than fiddling with unreliable hardware.
2006-10-19T05:50:00.000Z	loquitus_of_borg	soundray	agreed
2006-10-19T05:59:00.000Z	loquitus_of_borg	soundray	so if I try to reformat this thing remotely (the machine is about 1 hr drive away), is it possible it could hard lock on me again?
2006-10-19T06:01:00.000Z	soundray	loquitus_of_borg	of course it's possible. How are you going to reformat -- with badblocks checking?
2006-10-19T06:02:00.000Z	loquitus_of_borg	soundray	was thinking ext3 maybe
2006-10-19T06:04:00.000Z	soundray	loquitus_of_borg	you can try 'mke2fs -c -c -j /dev/hdcX' to have the best chance of fixing things. But really, bad blocks occurring in a newer hard disk is a sign of impending doom ;)
2008-07-24T15:13:00.000Z	soundray	loquitus_of_borg	reinstalling is your best option. Doesn't take long, and you can backup your /home
2008-07-24T15:27:00.000Z	soundray	loquitus_of_borg	sorry, got cut off
2008-07-24T15:23:00.000Z	soundray	loquitus_of_borg	I'm generally much in favour of fresh installations -- what's stopping you from doing that?
2008-07-24T15:23:00.000Z	loquitus_of_borg	soundray	I have alot of stuff installed on here and I really do not want to have to reinstall. besides it sucks to have to reinstall. this is not windows.
2008-07-24T15:28:00.000Z	soundray	loquitus_of_borg	you can save your package list (see clone factoid below), and keep your old installation around if you have enough HD space
2008-07-24T15:28:00.000Z	soundray	loquitus_of_borg	I understand your reservations about reinstalling, but Ubuntu evolves in such a way that it's sometimes beneficial to reinstall
2008-07-24T16:42:00.000Z	soundray	loquitus_of_borg	remember  the old  adage, data you haven't backed up is data you don't want
2008-07-24T16:43:00.000Z	loquitus_of_borg	soundray	I agree. sound advice. my quesiton still stands. can an upgrade make my data inaccessible? I thought that I could always boot a linux cd and mount the ext3 drive, in the worst case scenario.
2008-07-24T16:44:00.000Z	soundray	loquitus_of_borg	probably, yes. There are operations, however, that can make your partitions inaccessible if there's e.g. a power cut at precisely the wrong moment
2008-07-24T16:44:00.000Z	soundray	loquitus_of_borg	like partition resizing
2008-07-24T16:50:00.000Z	soundray	loquitus_of_borg	yw
