2011-09-16T03:52:00.000Z	agkdomo		pfft. still not showing up. guessi have to stick with 11.04
2011-09-16T03:53:00.000Z	agkdomo		nvm.
2011-09-16T03:53:00.000Z	agkdomo		it shows
2011-09-16T03:53:00.000Z	edbian	agkdomo	ha :)
2011-09-16T03:18:00.000Z	edbian	agkdomo	short answer: many of them.
2011-09-16T03:18:00.000Z	edbian	agkdomo	more specifically, binary files go into /usr/bin/
2011-09-16T03:18:00.000Z	edbian	agkdomo	and PPA's are not different from any other repo (just easier to set up).
2011-09-16T03:19:00.000Z	edbian	agkdomo	If you wanna back up personal files then just do /home
2011-09-16T03:20:00.000Z	edbian	agkdomo	backing up the programs you isntalled is much more complicated
2011-09-16T03:21:00.000Z	edbian	agkdomo	Because files for a given application might be into many different places.
2011-09-16T03:47:00.000Z	edbian	agkdomo	looking it up now
2011-09-16T03:48:00.000Z	edbian	agkdomo	gksudo update-manager -d
2011-09-16T03:53:00.000Z	edbian	agkdomo	sure :)
2011-09-16T03:54:00.000Z	edbian	agkdomo	very very little difference
2011-09-16T03:55:00.000Z	edbian	agkdomo	strange
2011-09-16T03:56:00.000Z	edbian	agkdomo	11.04 does not use gnome 3
2011-09-16T03:56:00.000Z	edbian	agkdomo	unless you isntalled it
2011-09-16T03:56:00.000Z	edbian	agkdomo	just type someone's name like I'm doing for you.
2011-09-16T03:57:00.000Z	edbian	agkdomo	You have to spell it right
2011-09-16T03:57:00.000Z	agkdomo	edbian	does it show now?
2011-09-16T03:57:00.000Z	edbian	agkdomo	yes
