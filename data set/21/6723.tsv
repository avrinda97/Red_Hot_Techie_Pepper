2007-02-09T13:54:00.000Z	FrenKy		Ok, after breef reading on the matter (NTFS support - ntfsmount link) I can see that suggested solution "ntfsmount" is not so good. This is what I found already when googling for the topic. But what I found is that ntfs-3g is much better and mor e reliable than the ntfsmount, so I said, let's use this one :) But now I see that it needs FUSE, and this comes with 2.6.20... Anybody has some idea will this kernel version soon be available as update for 6.06? 
2007-02-09T13:55:00.000Z	LycoLoco	FrenKy	it's very easy to set up and you can just follow the instructiosn for ubuntu over at ntfs-3g.org and you should be good to go
2007-02-09T13:55:00.000Z	FrenKy	LycoLoco	What ubuntu version you have*
2007-02-09T13:55:00.000Z	LycoLoco	FrenKy	you don't need to do a kernel compile or anything, just follow what it says - I'm using 6.10 Edgy
2007-02-09T13:55:00.000Z	FrenKy	LycoLoco	What Kernel version?
2007-02-09T13:56:00.000Z	LycoLoco	FrenKy	uh. I think 2.6.17 generic - whatever comes with Edgy stock
2007-02-09T13:56:00.000Z	FrenKy	LycoLoco	And that is the problem... I have 6.06 and the latest version is 2.15
2007-02-09T13:57:00.000Z	LycoLoco	FrenKy	ahh...so it doesn't allow for Fuse in there? :0\
2007-02-09T13:57:00.000Z	FrenKy	LycoLoco	But usermode Fs is available only in 2.6.20 :(
2007-02-09T13:57:00.000Z	LycoLoco	FrenKy	I know that it's workin in 2.6.17, so you might as well give it a shot
2007-02-09T13:58:00.000Z	FrenKy	LycoLoco	Noob here :) I'm fairly uncomfortable with manual update of kernel.. What do you think? I have not even looked at the topic...
2007-02-09T13:58:00.000Z	LycoLoco	FrenKy	nah, don't do a kernel update, I don't think you need it. If I remember correctly, Fuse will install the module you need without having to do a kernel compile

2007-02-09T14:37:00.000Z	FrenKy	LycoLoco	ntfs back :) Works, but I get that warning always... It is strange because I've checked (hopefully) all. But it works ;) Thanks for your help. I see you have some major problems, but this is far from my expertize sorry...
