2010-11-12T19:41:00.000Z	DaneM		Hello, everybody.  I've recently upgraded from 9.10 (amd64) to 10.04 and immediately after to 10.10.  I got this error a lot in the terminal output, and I don't know what it is:
2010-11-12T19:41:00.000Z	DaneM		/usr/lib/gdk-pixbuf-2.0/2.10.0/loaders.cache
2010-11-12T19:41:00.000Z	DaneM		missing
2010-11-12T19:41:00.000Z	DaneM		anybody know what that's about?
2010-11-12T19:42:00.000Z	ubuXubu	DaneM	when u see those bazillion errors hit enter
2010-11-12T19:43:00.000Z	DaneM	ubuXubu	It was in the terminal output of the distribution upgrade window.  It didn't require me to do anything.  Do you know why they happened?
2010-11-12T19:44:00.000Z	DaneM	ubuXubu	ok.  Thanks anyway.  Do you know if they're important?
2010-11-12T19:45:00.000Z	ubuXubu	DaneM	if you are referring to all thosse error messages thst occur at the very end...its more or less a bug in my opinion and was meaningless in my case
2010-11-12T19:45:00.000Z	DaneM	ubuXubu	thanks.
2010-11-12T19:46:00.000Z	DaneM	ubuXubu	oh, wow.  that sounds a little scarier...
2010-11-12T19:47:00.000Z	ubuXubu	DaneM	i found an explanation for it on google but i cant honeslty recall wut they said
2010-11-12T19:48:00.000Z	ubuXubu	DaneM	it was like something they just sorta let it ride
2010-11-12T19:48:00.000Z	DaneM	ubuXubu	I did a google search but couldn't find anything useful.  Trying another search string.
2010-11-12T19:48:00.000Z	DaneM	ubuXubu	nodnod
2010-11-12T19:48:00.000Z	ubuXubu	DaneM	i am  not 100percent your errors thing is mine exactly either
2010-11-12T19:49:00.000Z	DaneM	ubuXubu	ok.  I got them sporadically throughout going from 9.10 to 10.04, and then from 10.04 to 10.10.  I'll let you know if I find anything on them.
2010-11-12T19:51:00.000Z	DaneM	ubuXubu	eek!  Did you have any other (related) problems?
2010-11-12T19:52:00.000Z	DaneM	ubuXubu	Here's a web page I found with a bug report and a possible solution.  Doesn't explain why, though.  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gdk-pixbuf/+bug/619003
2010-11-12T19:57:00.000Z	ubuXubu	DaneM	did u check the cd for errors before u installed?
2010-11-12T19:58:00.000Z	DaneM	ubuXubu	I did an Internet upgrade, and I did check the CD for errors when I did the original 9.10 install (a long time ago)
2010-11-12T19:59:00.000Z	DaneM	ubuXubu	ok
