2011-05-11T16:20:00.000Z	arindom		Hi! I need help in solving my VPN Connectivity problem.
2011-05-11T16:20:00.000Z	arindom		While I can connect to VPN services but I can't view other public sites.
2011-05-11T16:21:00.000Z	arindom		That means if I get connected to the VPN resources, I will not be able to browse normal websites.
2011-05-11T16:21:00.000Z	ikonia	arindom	correct, because you are vpn'd into a private network, so the public internet is "blocked"
2011-05-11T16:22:00.000Z	arindom	ikonia	But in Win I can connect to both sites at the same time.
2011-05-11T16:22:00.000Z	ikonia	arindom	you're not using windows
2011-05-11T16:22:00.000Z	arindom	ikonia	you mean to say this is the right behaviour.
2011-05-11T16:22:00.000Z	ikonia	arindom	yes
2011-05-11T16:24:00.000Z	arindom	ikonia	But I have seen posts in different forum where they say that it is possible to browse both public and VPN sites at the same time in Ubuntu also. To do that one need to check the "Use this connection only for resource on its network" under routes.
2011-05-11T16:24:00.000Z	ikonia	arindom	it is possible if you sort your routing out
2011-05-11T16:25:00.000Z	arindom	ikonia	: That is the problem in my case. I can't even if that option is checked.
2011-05-11T16:25:00.000Z	arindom	ikonia	: To know more you can please view my post here: http://askubuntu.com/questions/39894/connecting-to-vpn-is-not-allowing-me-to-open-public-sites-simultaneously
2011-05-11T16:26:00.000Z	arindom	ikonia	Please help me to get this issue solved.
2011-05-11T16:28:00.000Z	ikonia	arindom	you need to configure your routing to send everything out of the default gateway, execpt your vpn traffic which will go out of the vpn interface
2011-05-11T16:29:00.000Z	arindom	ikonia	: Please suggest the commands that I should try and get values and then tell me where to put. I must have done it wrongly ealier.
2011-05-11T16:30:00.000Z	arindom	ikonia	It seems I have to enter the default gateway etc. under the auto eth1 or whatever is my network connection. Am I right?
2011-05-11T16:31:00.000Z	arindom	ikonia	BTW I am using a wireless connection via wireless router which is connected to the broadband modem.
2011-05-11T16:35:00.000Z	arindom	ikonia	Any suggestions for me?
2011-05-11T16:42:00.000Z	arindom	ikonia	Any suggestions?
2011-05-11T16:44:00.000Z	arindom	ikonia	Sorry I have to go now. Expected some kind of response.
2011-05-11T16:53:00.000Z	arindom	ikonia	Are you there? I just tried by adding the default route, but it didn't work
