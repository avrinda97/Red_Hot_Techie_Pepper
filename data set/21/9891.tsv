2005-07-06T14:05:00.000Z	jamey3		I accidentally wiped my MBR by running the NT setup; how can I restore this to load Ubuntu's grub/lilo?

2005-07-06T14:07:00.000Z	jamey3	Seveas	thanks... I will look on the Wiki next time :-)
2005-07-08T11:48:00.000Z	jamey3	Seveas	exactly
2005-07-10T08:10:00.000Z	jamey3	Seveas	exactly
2005-07-10T08:11:00.000Z	jamey3	Seveas	lol I love those games
2005-07-10T08:11:00.000Z	Seveas	jamey3	found the secret place already?
2005-07-10T10:06:00.000Z	Seveas	jamey3	watch your language...
2005-09-29T08:40:00.000Z	Seveas	jamey3	don't compile it yourself
2005-09-30T07:01:00.000Z	jamey3	Seveas	thanks :)
2005-10-03T14:00:00.000Z	jamey3	Seveas	ah thanks :)
2005-10-03T14:03:00.000Z	jamey3	Seveas	I've now tried removing .gconf, .gconfd (it didn't exist), .gnome2, .gnome2_private. I then ctrl+alt+backspace, re-login and the problem persists.
2005-10-03T14:04:00.000Z	Seveas	jamey3	logout, login in the console, clean out /tmp
2005-10-03T14:04:00.000Z	jamey3	Seveas	thanks brb then
2005-10-03T14:13:00.000Z	jamey3	Seveas	I've removed all of those hidden config directories in my ~, then wiped out everything in /tmp, rebooted and gnome-panel still crashes. Is there anyway to delete my user account, then recreate it with a "default" gnome config?
2005-10-03T14:14:00.000Z	Seveas	jamey3	sure, make sure you have a new account first
2005-10-03T14:15:00.000Z	jamey3	Seveas	okay... my current username is "james" so I'll just create "jamey" and mv my old home dir *files* over
2005-10-03T14:15:00.000Z	jamey3	Seveas	so just make sure I add it to the admin group?
2005-10-03T14:15:00.000Z	Seveas	jamey3	sounds like a plan
2005-10-03T14:15:00.000Z	jamey3	Seveas	cool thanks
2005-10-03T14:42:00.000Z	jamey3	Seveas	thank you very much... it worked perfectly. :-)
