2004-11-10T11:44:00.000Z	stvn	SuperLag	I know quite some linux users who never ever going to touch a text file
2004-11-10T11:45:00.000Z	SuperLag	stvn	what if X won't start, and all you have access to is the command line?
2004-11-10T11:46:00.000Z	stvn	SuperLag	ever tried installing windows on a mac?
2004-11-10T11:46:00.000Z	stvn	SuperLag	as long as the hardware is supported noone needs to edit text files
2004-11-10T11:46:00.000Z	SuperLag	stvn	yes, I've done it.  It was SLOW.
2004-11-10T11:47:00.000Z	SuperLag	stvn	that is 100% NOT true
2004-11-10T11:47:00.000Z	stvn	SuperLag	why?
2004-11-10T11:47:00.000Z	stvn	SuperLag	so, you put in new hardware
2004-11-10T11:48:00.000Z	stvn	SuperLag	those utilities/progs are not used by those who don't edit text files
2004-11-10T11:49:00.000Z	stvn	SuperLag	no it's not, the aim is to get an OS that just works, without losing to configuration power of it
2004-11-10T11:49:00.000Z	stvn	SuperLag	yeah, i know, you know but 'those' don't want to know
2004-11-10T11:54:00.000Z	SuperLag	stvn	so... I have a GRUB problem.  Mind telling me what graphical tool I'm going to use to fix it?
2004-11-10T11:55:00.000Z	stvn	SuperLag	how did you manage to get a grub problem in the first place?
2004-11-10T11:55:00.000Z	stvn	SuperLag	the trouble starts when ppl starts messing withstuff without knowledge, but most pl will not try to do so in the first place
2004-11-10T11:56:00.000Z	SuperLag	stvn	are you insinuating that I don't have knowledge? :)
2004-11-10T11:56:00.000Z	stvn	SuperLag	btw there's grubconf
2004-11-10T11:56:00.000Z	SuperLag	stvn	$first_distro on /dev/sda, Ubuntu on /dev/sdb
2004-11-10T11:56:00.000Z	SuperLag	stvn	not available to me, if I cannot boot Ubuntu (which is the case)
2004-11-10T11:56:00.000Z	stvn	SuperLag	like I said before, once it's up n running you don't need to edit text files, installation is still tricky
2004-11-10T11:57:00.000Z	stvn	SuperLag	huh, ubuntu didn't install?
2004-11-10T11:58:00.000Z	stvn	SuperLag	ah, but that's 'advanced' stuff, I know noone foolish enough to install two linux distros without being able to edit a text file ;)
