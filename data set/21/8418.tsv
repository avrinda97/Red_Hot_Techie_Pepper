2006-04-10T06:33:00.000Z	Noeve		Afternoon again... Nautilus crashes when I log in, and I get a 7914 error - cannot open display - when I try relaunching in terminal... It's not on the forums. Does anyone have any ideas ?
2006-04-10T06:35:00.000Z	Noeve		Healot,done.
2006-04-10T06:35:00.000Z	Noeve		No go.
2006-04-10T06:36:00.000Z	r_kinder	Noeve	does the ~/.xsession-errors give any useful information?
2006-04-10T06:36:00.000Z	Noeve		Healot, where is that folder ?
2006-04-10T06:37:00.000Z	Noeve		R_Kinder, I've just been given error 7914, Gtk-WARNING **: Cannot open display.
2006-04-10T06:37:00.000Z	r_kinder	Noeve	can you create another user account on the box and try logging in with that account?
2006-04-10T06:38:00.000Z	Noeve		R_Kinder, unfortunately I'm too much of a newb to manage that :P
2006-04-10T06:38:00.000Z	Noeve	xfcefreak	could you elaborate please ?
2006-04-10T06:39:00.000Z	Noeve	xfcefreak	my Nautilus won't load on login.
2006-04-10T06:42:00.000Z	r_kinder	Noeve	adding a new user is simple - type: sudo adduser newusername and the prompts will guide you through what to do.
2006-04-10T06:42:00.000Z	Noeve		R_Kinder, my thanks, I'll try that :)
2006-04-10T06:43:00.000Z	Noeve		R_Kinder, any ideas as to what could be causing the problem ?
2006-04-10T06:43:00.000Z	r_kinder	Noeve	not really, but if things work with a different account, then it looks like the account you are currently using could have some corrupted config.
2006-04-10T06:44:00.000Z	Noeve		R_Kinder, thanks. I'll bug you one last time :P How could I install KDE and set it as default using the terminal ?
2006-04-10T06:45:00.000Z	r_kinder	Noeve	I don't know the answer to that, but my suggestion would be to install 'kubuntu' rather than plain 'ubuntu' - it uses KDE by default.
2006-04-10T06:46:00.000Z	r_kinder	Noeve	provided you want KDE rather than Gnome as your desktop of course :)
2006-04-10T06:46:00.000Z	Noeve		R_Kinder, I've just been browsing the forums, and apparently Nautilus hasn't just been a bitch to me, and I've used KDE before, so I want to continue if this doesn't work.
2006-04-10T06:47:00.000Z	r_kinder	Noeve	what version of Ubuntu are you running?
2006-04-10T06:48:00.000Z	Noeve		R_Kinder, running Breezy.
2006-04-10T06:48:00.000Z	r_kinder	Noeve	ok - just checking you're on the stable release.
