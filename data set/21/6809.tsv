2007-01-26T08:37:00.000Z	mwalsh		DOes anyone know why I don't have permissions to write to my own hard drive?
2007-01-26T08:38:00.000Z	Chousuke	mwalsh	the default user only has access to /home/username
2007-01-26T08:40:00.000Z	Chousuke	mwalsh	permanent root access is a _very_ bad idea.
2007-01-26T08:41:00.000Z	Chousuke	mwalsh	because then every little vulnerability in your system can lead to the entire system being hosed.
2007-01-26T08:41:00.000Z	Chousuke	mwalsh	also, you're more likely to break things you shouldn't even be able to touch
2007-01-26T08:41:00.000Z	Chousuke	mwalsh	and anyone who has access to your computer while you're away can just do rm -rf /
2007-01-26T08:43:00.000Z	Chousuke	mwalsh	you can give your regular user permission to write to NTFS.
2007-01-26T08:43:00.000Z	mwalsh	Chousuke	I tried the ntfs-3g thing, didnt work
2007-01-26T08:43:00.000Z	Chousuke	mwalsh	though writing is only possible with ntfs-3g
2007-01-26T08:44:00.000Z	mwalsh	Chousuke	YOu think you could tell me how to get my dvd burners working on Ubuntu
2007-01-26T08:44:00.000Z	Chousuke	mwalsh	did you set the permission masks properly?
2007-01-26T08:44:00.000Z	Chousuke	mwalsh	it isn't autodetected?
2007-01-26T08:44:00.000Z	mwalsh	Chousuke	no, most of my hardware isnt, i think its too new... ubuntu has been suckign in that regard
2007-01-26T08:46:00.000Z	Chousuke	mwalsh	hmm :/
2007-01-26T08:46:00.000Z	Chousuke	mwalsh	I have to go to sleep now though.
2007-01-26T08:46:00.000Z	Chousuke	mwalsh	maybe someone else can help you
2007-01-26T08:46:00.000Z	Chousuke	mwalsh	you don't mount empty dvds
