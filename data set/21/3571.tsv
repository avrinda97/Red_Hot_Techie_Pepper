2008-11-22T08:14:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	GeminiK	ctrl+alt+f1 should give you a text console to log in. then check with ls -la if all the files in your home folder belong to you and not to root.
2008-11-22T08:15:00.000Z	GeminiK	zsquareplusc	ill check, brb
2008-11-22T08:23:00.000Z	GeminiK	zsquareplusc	yeah some are root, by the way how do us scrol up in terminal?
2008-11-22T08:23:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	GeminiK	shift+pageup
2008-11-22T08:24:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	GeminiK	maybe one of these files are the problem. you should probably chown them back to your user
2008-11-22T08:25:00.000Z	GeminiK	zsquareplusc	yea, don't see why any of them should be root either, so how would I do that?
2008-11-22T08:25:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	GeminiK	chown $USER.$USER file(s)
2008-11-22T08:26:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	GeminiK	you probably used sudo for a gui application that wrote these. that is what gksudo would solve
2008-11-22T08:28:00.000Z	GeminiK	zsquareplusc	ah ok gksudo prevents root files in home?
2008-11-22T08:29:00.000Z	GeminiK	zsquareplusc	well ill use chown on files brb
2008-11-22T08:47:00.000Z	GeminiK	zsquareplusc	well it didn't work, I might have done something with the sessions
2008-11-22T08:48:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	GeminiK	next step would eb moving the .gnome and such folder away. this would make the applications start up with the defaults again (w/o the need to create a new user)
2008-11-22T08:49:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	GeminiK	or use mv for move
2008-11-22T08:50:00.000Z	GeminiK	zsquareplusc	k hope it works
2008-11-22T09:02:00.000Z	GeminiK	zsquareplusc	didn't work, noticed that it didn'
2008-11-22T09:03:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	GeminiK	hm maybe one of the other folder. you could use adduser and create a new account. so you'd at least know if the system works basically
2008-11-22T09:04:00.000Z	GeminiK	zsquareplusc	yeah got to check that, this looks a little messed, brb, adduser right?
2008-11-22T09:05:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	GeminiK	are you booting into an other system each time? because you could do this without rebooting. but you'd need to use a text mode chat then ;-)
2008-11-22T09:07:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	GeminiK	irssi. not using it myself but you'll find a fan club in this channel :-)
2008-11-22T09:08:00.000Z	GeminiK	zsquareplusc	looking it up, ill have it install, this was getting depressing, booting into windows and all lol
2008-11-22T09:24:00.000Z	GeminiK	zsquareplusc	ok tried the new user, it dind't work, system is screwd up :(
