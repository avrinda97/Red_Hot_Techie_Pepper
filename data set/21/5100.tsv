2007-12-26T23:09:00.000Z	RoshanK	Jack_Sparrow	how would i restart emerald or possibly x?
2007-12-26T23:10:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	RoshanK	hold alt , click and drag the window
2007-12-26T23:11:00.000Z	RoshanK	Jack_Sparrow	i don't know what the alt click and drag would do apart from move it on workspaces
2007-12-26T23:12:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	RoshanK	I thought you just needed it for this one occurance..
2007-12-26T23:17:00.000Z	RoshanK	Jack_Sparrow	or MenZa btw when i entered 'emerald --replace' the command dosent seem to finish b/c it said something wasnt suppoerted and would be ignored
2007-12-26T23:17:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	RoshanK	HAve you changed any sources or installed things from non-official repos
2007-12-26T23:18:00.000Z	RoshanK	Jack_Sparrow	these are some themes i got off of gnome art i believe
2007-12-26T23:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	RoshanK	that shouldnt be the issue....   hopefully you didnt run automatix or envy  either(both bad ideas)
2007-12-26T23:20:00.000Z	RoshanK	Jack_Sparrow	i didn't im running gutsy
2007-12-26T23:24:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	RoshanK	Careful using that with programs still running...
2007-12-26T23:25:00.000Z	RoshanK	Jack_Sparrow	so i guess i would have to make sure i save changes huh. apart from that is there a shortcut to open something like taskmanager in ubuntu (like ctrl alt delete)
2007-12-26T23:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	RoshanK	MOre than just losing your changes you could cause other problems, some people here are fanatic about not using that command and just having people log out etc
2007-12-26T23:27:00.000Z	RoshanK	Jack_Sparrow	after i ran the command i realized i could've just logged out and did the same., but is there a shortcut to press to bring up a taskmanager like in windows?
2007-12-26T23:28:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	RoshanK	You can read up on killing a process if that is what you mean
2007-12-26T23:28:00.000Z	RoshanK	Jack_Sparrow	thank you
2007-12-26T23:29:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	RoshanK	I understand what you WANT to do, I just question your reasoning behind wanting to...
2007-12-26T23:29:00.000Z	RoshanK	Jack_Sparrow	in the case the system froze i was wondering what to do
2007-12-26T23:30:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	RoshanK	My fear is that you will mess up the dependencies and the next update will crash or create other problems
2007-12-26T23:31:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	RoshanK	np... man kill in term will have info
2007-12-27T00:56:00.000Z	RoshanK	Jack_Sparrow	do you know as to how i would setup ssh server? I installed open-ssh from the synaptic packet manager but what do i do from there?
2007-12-27T00:57:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	RoshanK	  I have the day off...  just lurking  I dont do ssh....someone will know
