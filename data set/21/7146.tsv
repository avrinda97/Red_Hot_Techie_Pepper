2006-11-19T12:42:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	saxofoner	do it as root, via sudo
2006-11-19T12:42:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	saxofoner	'sudo fsck ...'
2006-11-19T12:44:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	saxofoner	yeah that's normal, good
2006-11-19T12:45:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	saxofoner	you sure you ran fsck on the right partition?  do you only have one partition?
2006-11-19T12:45:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	saxofoner	that was sda6, the seventh partition, is grub loading from a different one maybe?
2006-11-19T12:45:00.000Z	saxofoner	Kingsqueak	 Did you see this thread: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=301835  that's where my problem is, I don't know where else it would be.  I'll try some others, thanks.
2006-11-19T12:47:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	saxofoner	hmm
2006-11-19T12:47:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	saxofoner	sorry, I'm not sure, I do agree it might be a hardware issue, have you seen anything odd in /var/log/messages error wise?
2006-11-19T12:49:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	saxofoner	you can use 'less' to view it
2006-11-19T12:49:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	saxofoner	though if you are that new, you may not understand what to look for
2006-11-19T12:50:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	saxofoner	k, look for ide or scsi or filesystem problems in the logs for one or memory errors
2006-11-19T12:52:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	saxofoner	oh   less /var/log/messages    'q' quits it and j/k scroll the file
2006-11-19T12:53:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	saxofoner	shift-g  goes to the end of the file, might be more useful for later messages
2006-11-19T12:54:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	saxofoner	well do this   tail -100 /var/log/messages     pastebin that as a start
2006-11-19T12:56:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	saxofoner	k, gimme a bit
2006-11-19T12:57:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	saxofoner	hmm yeah that looks o.k.
2006-11-19T12:57:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	saxofoner	if you can do that, run a bad blocks check on the whole thing, takes forever but it's worth a check
2006-11-19T12:58:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	saxofoner	it's an odd issue you're having so I just don't have a great answer
2006-11-19T12:58:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	saxofoner	you running Edgy or Dapper on this?
2006-11-19T12:59:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	saxofoner	I would say if you are going to reinstall, try Edgy and also do what mamzers555 suggested
