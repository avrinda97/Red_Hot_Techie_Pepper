2009-11-02T14:29:00.000Z	syn-ack	obiwan_	re read his question.
2009-11-04T08:15:00.000Z	syn-ack	obiwan_	um, what?
2009-11-04T08:17:00.000Z	obiwan_	syn-ack	hi , some guys told me that compiling the system for my own  system would run better, so i thought i'll just pick the default source (cause i still duno how to tweak the source) and i'll compile it, i want to get the exact same working default setup canonical used to compile ubuntu, but  in source so i can compile it
2009-11-04T08:45:00.000Z	syn-ack	obiwan_	the whole point to running ubuntu is that its package based distro. You will not notice any difference from a "generic" build and an "optimised" don't listen to those Gentoo guys
2009-11-04T09:04:00.000Z	syn-ack	obiwan_	you're wasting your time
2009-11-04T09:06:00.000Z	obiwan_	syn-ack	why you think im wastin my time?
2009-11-04T09:07:00.000Z	syn-ack	obiwan_	Because, there is a point to using a package based distro.. and you're wanting to go against the grain
2009-11-04T09:07:00.000Z	obiwan_	syn-ack	i don't really know what a package basd distro mean, don't all the distros work that way? you want something, you get the package and install it
2009-11-04T09:08:00.000Z	obiwan_	syn-ack	what distro isn't package based?
2009-11-04T09:08:00.000Z	syn-ack	obiwan_	Gentoo
2009-11-04T09:08:00.000Z	obiwan_	syn-ack	but gentoo is also package based isn't it? i read that it has emerge a kind of apt-get to download packages
