2005-03-31T14:16:00.000Z	waseem		zanz: i havent downloaded the file yet, i want to open up bittorrent to do that
2005-03-31T14:16:00.000Z	linux_galore	waseem	  ls  *.torr
2005-03-31T14:16:00.000Z	waseem	linux_galore	what should my directory be
2005-03-31T14:16:00.000Z	linux_galore	waseem	dont know.....you downloaded the file not me
2005-03-31T14:17:00.000Z	waseem	linux_galore	i didnt download any file
2005-03-31T14:17:00.000Z	linux_galore	waseem	check the program that downloaded the file should show you were it put it
2005-03-31T14:17:00.000Z	linux_galore	waseem	well then what are you looking for
2005-03-31T14:18:00.000Z	linux_galore	waseem	 usually you just click on the torrent link on the web page and the browser powers up your default torrent app
2005-03-31T14:19:00.000Z	linux_galore	waseem	there are web sites dedicated to set media formats so i usually just google for  what I want
2005-03-31T14:31:00.000Z	linux_galore	waseem	yes
2005-03-31T14:32:00.000Z	waseem	linux_galore	the problem is it never connects to any of my peers
2005-03-31T14:32:00.000Z	linux_galore	waseem	aaah bet you have the bittorent port closed on the firewall
