2007-11-04T23:00:00.000Z	riaal		Is there any command that will display the access of a file like "read write and execute" rather then rwe?
2007-11-04T23:01:00.000Z	|Bryan|	riaal	i am not aware of anything that spells out permissions - may i ask why you want that?
2007-11-04T23:02:00.000Z	riaal	|Bryan|	for a script
2007-11-04T23:02:00.000Z	|Bryan|	riaal	you should be able to read the input of rwx just as easily (if not easier) than the words read write execute
2007-11-04T23:03:00.000Z	|Bryan|	riaal	but i obviously don't know what/how you're doing it so maybe that won't work for you
2007-11-04T23:04:00.000Z	riaal	|Bryan|	that true, but I want it printed for the user
2007-11-04T23:04:00.000Z	|Bryan|	riaal	modify your script to output "read" if the value is r--, "read, write" if the value is rw-, etc etc
2007-11-04T23:05:00.000Z	riaal	|Bryan|	tought about that but it is quite a job
2007-11-04T23:05:00.000Z	|Bryan|	riaal	what language your using?
2007-11-04T23:05:00.000Z	riaal	|Bryan|	bash
2007-11-04T23:07:00.000Z	|Bryan|	riaal	don't go away
