2006-09-05T16:05:00.000Z	robbbb		i'm getting rid of xp
2006-09-05T16:06:00.000Z	robbbb		is there any way of making a program like bing run as a user
2006-09-05T16:06:00.000Z	robbbb		i'm trying to run bing without sudo
2006-09-05T16:08:00.000Z	robbbb		what does sticky uid do?
2006-09-05T16:10:00.000Z	mjr	robbbb	it's not "uid", it's just sticky. Nothing for files nowadays, for directories it spesifies that you need to be the owner of a file to delete it even if you have write to the directory (or the owner of the directory)
2006-09-05T16:10:00.000Z	robbbb		so it wont let me run a file as root then
2006-09-05T16:11:00.000Z	robbbb		ah cool that seems to work! cheers whoever suggest the sticky uid!
2006-09-05T16:12:00.000Z	robbbb		isn't it a bit dodgy being able to set sticky uid and run something with root privs from a user account?
2006-09-05T16:13:00.000Z	robbbb		seems to let me run stuff as root without sudo
2006-09-05T16:13:00.000Z	robbbb		so is this sticky uid a bad idea then?
2006-09-05T16:14:00.000Z	robbbb		just to run a few net utils without having to bang in the sudo password
2006-09-05T16:14:00.000Z	mjr	robbbb	you're not talking about sticky then, but suid (setuid); usually a bad idea if you don't know what you're doing
2006-09-05T16:15:00.000Z	robbbb	mjr	oh yeah sorry thats what i meant
2006-09-05T16:15:00.000Z	robbbb	mjr	bad idea then?
2006-09-05T16:15:00.000Z	robbbb	mjr	i only need to run a few tools with it
