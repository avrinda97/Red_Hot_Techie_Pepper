2008-03-08T22:23:00.000Z	Burt		i have installed GaG boot loader, after installing windows xp on a new partition...i can boot xp from it but it says it cannot find the ubuntu/linux boot sector
2008-03-08T22:23:00.000Z	Burt		any way i can fix this?
2008-03-08T22:24:00.000Z	Flare183	Burt	you shouldn't have install another boot loader
2008-03-08T22:24:00.000Z	Flare183	Burt	grub is perfect for both ubuntu and Windows
2008-03-08T22:25:00.000Z	Burt	Flare183	will it be pretty simple?
2008-03-08T22:25:00.000Z	Flare183	Burt	should be if you have the ubuntu live cd
2008-03-08T22:26:00.000Z	Flare183	Burt	then use it
2008-03-08T22:30:00.000Z	Burt	Flare183	would this install over gag?
2008-03-08T22:30:00.000Z	Flare183	Burt	yeah it should
2008-03-08T22:31:00.000Z	Burt	Flare183	is it safe to partition like I did? give a few gigs more to my huge ubuntu install and make the rest a new partition for xp?
2008-03-08T22:31:00.000Z	Flare183	Burt	yeah just don't use any other bootloader
2008-03-08T22:32:00.000Z	Burt	Flare183	would there be any special reason that windows xp has trouble booting every couple times?
2008-03-08T22:32:00.000Z	Burt	Flare183	would it be xp's boot loader freaking out?
2008-03-08T22:32:00.000Z	Flare183	Burt	I don't think so
2008-03-08T22:32:00.000Z	Burt	Flare183	huh
2008-03-08T22:33:00.000Z	Burt	Flare183	thats not good.
2008-03-08T22:33:00.000Z	Flare183	Burt	Xp's boot loader sucks and it doesn't likes Ubuntu
2008-03-08T22:33:00.000Z	Flare183	Burt	What is it?
2008-03-08T22:33:00.000Z	Burt	Flare183	it just locks up right before user select alot
2008-03-08T22:34:00.000Z	Flare183	Burt	oh crap that's not good
2008-03-08T22:36:00.000Z	Flare183	Burt	I don't know either
