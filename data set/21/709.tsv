2011-09-02T18:49:00.000Z	Fenixdeux		Hi. I just installed Xubuntu linux ( now I have 3 linuxen systems ) using pendrivelinux.com's software and the keymap is almost working almost, now if I could just compose "ç" ( alt-c in OS X ), "ß" (alt-s) and "ü" ( alt-u ) chars it'd be perfect
2011-09-02T18:50:00.000Z	Fenixdeux		it'd be perfect perfect perfect ... Windows 7 was weird, I mean I know how to use Windooze 95 and Windooze XP SP2 but this I didn't really hack
2011-09-02T18:50:00.000Z	Exodus	Fenixdeux	change your keyboard layout to match the one used in OS X
2011-09-02T18:51:00.000Z	Exodus	Fenixdeux	they're almost all present in every OS. I for one use US International which lets me use éáóúüö easily on the keyboard.
2011-09-02T18:51:00.000Z	Fenixdeux	Exodus	this is my OS X machine, I used Xubuntu linux for my new netbook that came with Windows / Starter so I dunno if setting Mapple settings help
2011-09-02T18:55:00.000Z	Exodus	Fenixdeux	link didn't come out right
2011-09-02T18:55:00.000Z	Fenixdeux	Exodus	yes it did if you have Wikilinks1.7 for Chatzilla
2011-09-02T18:55:00.000Z	Exodus	Fenixdeux	most people don't use Chatzilla
2011-09-02T18:56:00.000Z	Exodus	Fenixdeux	also, Wikilinks isn't something portable or highly used enough for you to mainstream it into a chat with multiple clients. I use Xchat and requiere a URL not wiki formatting
2011-09-02T18:56:00.000Z	Fenixdeux	Exodus	yeah.. Quassel with the core installed on my VPS Ubuntu 10.04 Server Edition and client on my Xubuntu 11.04
2011-09-02T18:58:00.000Z	Exodus	Fenixdeux	so, back to the keymap, I don't particularly know a specific xubuntu way, like if there's a program in xubuntu settings to change it
2011-09-02T18:58:00.000Z	Exodus	Fenixdeux	but I do know that you can change it manually in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2011-09-02T18:59:00.000Z	Fenixdeux	Exodus	I'm having trouble getting German and French exclusive characters but other then that it ( Xubuntu 11.04 ) is working like a charm
2011-09-02T18:59:00.000Z	Exodus	Fenixdeux	you just have to find the name of your variant. Mine is US International (With dead keys)
2011-09-02T18:59:00.000Z	Exodus	Fenixdeux	yeah, changing the keyboard layout will fix that.
2011-09-02T19:00:00.000Z	Exodus	Fenixdeux	I speak spanish so I need the accents on my vowels áéöü
2011-09-02T19:04:00.000Z	Exodus	Fenixdeux	I just read XFCE has a keyboard layout changer. Go to the settings menu, the settings manager. There should be a Keyboard item there.

2011-09-02T19:04:00.000Z	Fenixdeux	Exodus	will see
2011-09-02T19:05:00.000Z	Exodus	Fenixdeux	don't know if it's there in your version, but there should be something similar.
2011-09-02T19:08:00.000Z	Exodus	Fenixdeux	the good news is that isn't something OS X only. That is just OS X using that keyboard layout. You just have to select it in linux like you did or whoever installed that OS X did.
