2004-10-18T06:48:00.000Z	swoon	phosphorgreen	great but what lines would I enter to set gateway, dns, host name and stuff?
2004-10-18T07:19:00.000Z	swoon	phosphorgreen	 whatever I need to be to install the nvidia driver
2004-10-18T07:20:00.000Z	phosphorgreen	swoon	did you apt-get the nvidia driver from the ubuntu repository or did u get the nvidia drivers from the nvidia.com site?
2004-10-18T07:21:00.000Z	swoon	phosphorgreen	from nvidia.com
2004-10-18T07:21:00.000Z	phosphorgreen	swoon	i have apt-getted my current nvidia drivers (they appear to be the nvidia.com drivers).
2004-10-18T07:21:00.000Z	swoon	phosphorgreen	 what would the command be: apt-get nvidia ?
2004-10-18T07:22:00.000Z	swoon	phosphorgreen	just "synaptic nvidia" ?
2004-10-18T07:23:00.000Z	swoon	phosphorgreen	 I cant get into X until I instll the nvidia driver see
2004-10-18T07:23:00.000Z	phosphorgreen	swoon	no, go into x and forget the nvidia driver you got from nvidia.com
2004-10-18T07:23:00.000Z	swoon	phosphorgreen	 I cannot use x without the new driver! simply cannot see the screen without the new driver...
2004-10-18T07:25:00.000Z	phosphorgreen	swoon	apt-get install nvidia-glx nvidia-glx-dev nvidia-kernel-common nvidia-settings
2004-10-19T16:52:00.000Z	swoon	phosphorgreen	the amd 64 nvidia driver
2004-10-19T16:54:00.000Z	phosphorgreen	swoon	if you really want to install the driver I believe you need to download the kernel headers, kernel source and let the nvidia.com driver bin file compile the correct module. Is that what you have done?
2004-10-19T16:55:00.000Z	swoon	phosphorgreen	yes thats what Ive been trying to do and I get this error:  If you are using a linux 2.6 kernel please make sure you have configured kernel sources matching your kernel istalled on your system. do I not have the proper source? do I maybe not have amd 64 kernel source?
2004-10-19T16:56:00.000Z	phosphorgreen	swoon	are you entirely sure that the CD you have is bootable?
2004-10-19T16:57:00.000Z	swoon	phosphorgreen	 um was the CD question for me?
2004-10-23T16:31:00.000Z	phosphorgreen	swoon	usually gcc and g++ plus all libs required for what you are compiling, eg libstdc++, gtk++, etc, etc. Depends on what you are compiling
2004-10-23T16:33:00.000Z	swoon	phosphorgreen	Im guessing for g++, I want g++-3.4,   instead of g++, or g++-3.3 ?
2004-10-23T05:09:00.000Z	phosphorgreen	swoon	press Ctrl+Alt+F1. Log in and type /etc/rc2.d/S99gdm stop
2004-10-23T05:10:00.000Z	phosphorgreen	swoon	oh and u need to be root to do that, so sudo it
