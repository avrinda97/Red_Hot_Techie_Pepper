2010-05-03T01:47:00.000Z	bluekoala		Anyone using 10.04?
2010-05-03T01:47:00.000Z	bluekoala		Is the new chat feature working properly?
2010-05-03T01:48:00.000Z	dancallo	bluekoala	works for me.
2010-05-03T01:49:00.000Z	bluekoala	dancallo	Same issue here
2010-05-03T01:49:00.000Z	bluekoala	dancallo	That's why I came here :P
2010-05-03T01:50:00.000Z	dancallo	bluekoala	I guess we'll wait to see if anyone else answers us.
2010-05-03T01:50:00.000Z	bluekoala	dancallo	If I go in the chat accounts, disable and re-enable then it works
2010-05-03T01:51:00.000Z	bluekoala	dancallo	Can you try it?
2010-05-03T01:51:00.000Z	dancallo	bluekoala	permanent fix or temporary. I'll try. One moment.
2010-05-03T01:52:00.000Z	bluekoala	dancallo	It's a temporary fix,
2010-05-03T01:53:00.000Z	dancallo	bluekoala	how do you disable the account? Do you mean remove?
2010-05-03T01:53:00.000Z	bluekoala	dancallo	no, just uncheck the "enable" checkbox
2010-05-03T01:54:00.000Z	dancallo	bluekoala	Okay, I see that now. I did that but can't tell if it worked since the person in my buddy list may, in fact, be offline.
2010-05-03T01:57:00.000Z	dancallo	bluekoala	did you see my last message?
2010-05-03T01:59:00.000Z	bluekoala	dancallo	lol I saw it yes
2010-05-03T01:59:00.000Z	dancallo	bluekoala	No, I did what you asked me to do but can't test it.
2010-05-03T02:00:00.000Z	bluekoala	dancallo	 So how do you know it wasn't working in the first place?
2010-05-03T02:01:00.000Z	dancallo	bluekoala	when the person in my contact list was online, the app stated offline. Now, I don't have any idea if they're online or not,
2010-05-03T02:01:00.000Z	dancallo	bluekoala	the app still shows offline.
2010-05-03T02:01:00.000Z	bluekoala	dancallo	Withat what? MSN? AIM?
2010-05-03T02:02:00.000Z	bluekoala	dancallo	Can't help you there buddy, I abandoned ICQ a LONG time ago because it's just plain flaky
