2009-02-27T23:13:00.000Z	mikeypizano		hey, can i sync rhythmbox between comps
2009-02-27T23:13:00.000Z	mikeypizano		rating/play count, new songs added
2009-02-27T23:15:00.000Z	mikeypizano		the thing is i have 2 comps (laptop and desktop) and would like to sync both, maybe using a usb hdd?
2009-02-27T23:15:00.000Z	_VIM_	mikeypizano	you could try to use rsync for what usser is talking bout
2009-02-27T23:16:00.000Z	_VIM_	mikeypizano	In theory you'd have to use rsync to sync both rythembox profiles
2009-02-27T23:16:00.000Z	_VIM_	mikeypizano	 there is a GUI for rsync called grsync :)
2009-02-27T23:20:00.000Z	_VIM_	mikeypizano	unison is also nice for syncing data between two connected (local?) computers (not sure if it can do outside of local net) if you search synaptic theres a GUI for unison too i think it's Unison-gtk :)
2009-02-27T23:21:00.000Z	_VIM_	mikeypizano	 its better to ask the room for support issues , chat is in #Ubuntu-offtopic
2009-02-27T23:23:00.000Z	_VIM_	mikeypizano	well I do know unison has the capability to do ssh connections, not sur ebout Firewire though.
2009-02-27T23:25:00.000Z	_VIM_	mikeypizano	one last thing if you wanted this to be automatic like every day, you can use gnome-schedule (GUI for cron) and set up rsyncs command in that
2009-02-27T23:25:00.000Z	_VIM_	mikeypizano	of course
2009-02-27T23:27:00.000Z	_VIM_	mikeypizano	correct, your ratings are stored onto a file in .rythembox folder
2009-02-27T23:28:00.000Z	_VIM_	mikeypizano	so this is why you need grsyn/unison type app to have rythembox profile on both comps
2009-02-27T23:29:00.000Z	_VIM_	mikeypizano	I think Amarok does that but im not too sure...
2009-02-27T23:29:00.000Z	_VIM_	mikeypizano	and the same principle would work for Amarok's folder
2009-02-27T23:31:00.000Z	_VIM_	mikeypizano	 well that's possible too with rsync/grsync or unison , very very powerful app , not much it cannot do. :)
2009-02-27T23:32:00.000Z	_VIM_	mikeypizano	no, just set the library on computer 1.... let grysnc/unison transfer stuff to computer 2
2009-02-27T23:32:00.000Z	_VIM_	mikeypizano	did you install it yet? just type grsync in a term
2009-02-27T23:34:00.000Z	_VIM_	mikeypizano	 ok you need to set up a source and destination... so you have to choose if you want computer #1 to put the data on a usb or whatnot...
2009-02-27T23:36:00.000Z	_VIM_	mikeypizano	its very small prolly under 2 megs at the most
2009-02-27T23:37:00.000Z	_VIM_	mikeypizano	unless you planning on syncing /home you should be ok
