2009-08-30T03:06:00.000Z	titan_ark		neither for boot, nor flash videos nor mp3s
2009-08-30T03:07:00.000Z	titan_ark		I tried quite a few things and am frustrated, vista sucks and now ubuntu troubling me too :'(
2009-08-30T03:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	titan_ark	are you running a lap top?
2009-08-30T03:07:00.000Z	titan_ark	sebsebseb	yes its a hp pavilion dv4t
2009-08-30T03:07:00.000Z	titan_ark		came preloaded with vista home premium
2009-08-30T03:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	titan_ark	that explains it,  it's usauly lap tops,  that get  sound  and wireless issues with Ubuntu, since lack of proper manufacture support
2009-08-30T03:08:00.000Z	titan_ark		yeah  i know
2009-08-30T03:08:00.000Z	titan_ark		my desktop works like a  charm
2009-08-30T03:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	titan_ark	there we go, really your lap top was made for Vista, and  so you can't just expect everything to work just like that with Ubuntu
2009-08-30T03:08:00.000Z	titan_ark		sebseb now i dont think ubuntu was made so uncompatible
2009-08-30T03:09:00.000Z	titan_ark		yeah i tried that
2009-08-30T03:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	titan_ark	oh  loads of   good hardware support in the Linux kernel, thing is most of it has been reverse enginered,  because of closed hardware specs
2009-08-30T03:09:00.000Z	titan_ark		a friend has the same notebook and he helped me try his settings but it dint seem to work
2009-08-30T03:09:00.000Z	titan_ark		i had tried something before that, so i am wondering if its conflicting now
2009-08-30T03:10:00.000Z	titan_ark		and he is using the i386 and not amd64
2009-08-30T03:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	titan_ark	well no computer is 100% the same
2009-08-30T03:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	titan_ark	your on 64?
2009-08-30T03:10:00.000Z	titan_ark		yeah
2009-08-30T03:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	titan_ark	sometimes 32bit Ubuntu is better than 64bit Ubuntu
2009-08-30T03:11:00.000Z	titan_ark		well i did see about a lot of compatibility issues
2009-08-30T03:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	titan_ark	you could  sort yourself  out with a 32bit Live CD, and try  the sound   using that
