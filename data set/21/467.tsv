2011-12-24T11:08:00.000Z	st_prg		Hi guys, I am trying to compile PHP on 10.11 and it can not find apxs - I have done some extensive searching and can not find a hint as to where the location of it may be.
2011-12-24T11:08:00.000Z	EvilResistance	st_prg	 there is no such thing as 10.11
2011-12-24T11:09:00.000Z	EvilResistance	st_prg	 do you mean 11.10?
2011-12-24T11:11:00.000Z	st_prg	EvilResistance	Sorry yes 11.10...
2011-12-24T11:11:00.000Z	EvilResistance	st_prg	 which PHP are you compiling?  you should be able to use what's already in the repos
2011-12-24T11:11:00.000Z	EvilResistance	st_prg	 php5 exists in the repos
2011-12-24T11:11:00.000Z	EvilResistance	st_prg	 ah... yeah you might run into issues compiling the newer versions of PHP for 10.10
2011-12-24T11:12:00.000Z	EvilResistance	st_prg	 well do you absolutely need 5.3.8?
2011-12-24T11:12:00.000Z	EvilResistance	st_prg	 i assume upgrading to natty or oneiric is out of the question?
2011-12-24T11:12:00.000Z	EvilResistance	st_prg	 do you absolutely need ***CUTTING EDGE*** PHP
2011-12-24T11:13:00.000Z	EvilResistance	st_prg	 then you're kind of SOL
2011-12-24T11:13:00.000Z	EvilResistance	st_prg	 the file you need to build php doesnt exist on maverick (10.10)
2011-12-24T11:14:00.000Z	EvilResistance	st_prg	 "s*** out of luck"
2011-12-24T11:14:00.000Z	EvilResistance	st_prg	 in a few months maverick is going to be out of date...
2011-12-24T11:14:00.000Z	EvilResistance	st_prg	 at which point you'll kinda need to upgrade
2011-12-24T11:14:00.000Z	EvilResistance	st_prg	 you could upgrade to 11.04 (which is stable)
2011-12-24T11:16:00.000Z	EvilResistance	st_prg	 there's many windows managers and what not
2011-12-24T11:16:00.000Z	EvilResistance	st_prg	 if yo udont want to switch to other environments, i'd install gnome-shell and then use that rather than unity
2011-12-24T11:17:00.000Z	st_prg	EvilResistance	Yea I know about all of those. XFCE and LXDE are ok but I dont think they live up to how I would use them. I dont really like KDE - GNOME has a feel about it I just prefer if you get what I mean :)
2011-12-24T11:17:00.000Z	EvilResistance	st_prg	 i uninstalled unity while using unity
2011-12-24T11:24:00.000Z	st_prg	EvilResistance	It might have something to do with the illuminati??? :D
