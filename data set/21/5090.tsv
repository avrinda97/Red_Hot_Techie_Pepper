2007-12-29T01:32:00.000Z	ruz322	aaran	can you post your xorg.conf file?
2007-12-29T01:33:00.000Z	ruz322	aaran	/etc/X11/xorg.conf post it to a pastebin and give me a link
2007-12-29T01:35:00.000Z	ruz322	aaran	http://pastebin.ca/
2007-12-29T01:38:00.000Z	ruz322	aaran	you getting it?
2007-12-29T01:39:00.000Z	aaran	ruz322	http://pastebin.ca/835331
2007-12-29T01:40:00.000Z	ruz322	aaran	you only have that resolution declard in your xorg.conf
2007-12-29T01:41:00.000Z	ruz322	aaran	have you modified this file yourself at all or is the one that was made when you installed ubuntu?
2007-12-29T01:41:00.000Z	ruz322	aaran	has it ever worked before?
2007-12-29T01:42:00.000Z	ruz322	aaran	i mean has it ever worked with any other resolution, to be honest, it looks like something has editted that file, its working, but strangely formatted
2007-12-29T01:42:00.000Z	ruz322	aaran	ok, what im gonn have you do is back up your old config file, then re-generate a new one, hopefully getting it going
2007-12-29T01:43:00.000Z	ruz322	aaran	open a terminal and execute the following: "cd /etc/X11/
2007-12-29T01:43:00.000Z	ruz322	aaran	"sudo mv xorg.conf xorg.conf.bak"
2007-12-29T01:43:00.000Z	ruz322	aaran	sudo dexconf
2007-12-29T01:44:00.000Z	ruz322	aaran	let me konw when you do all of that
2007-12-29T01:45:00.000Z	ruz322	aaran	did you do the dexconf as root?
2007-12-29T01:45:00.000Z	ruz322	aaran	do "sudo dexconf"
2007-12-29T01:46:00.000Z	ruz322	aaran	now pastebin your xorg.conf file again and give me the link
2007-12-29T01:48:00.000Z	ruz322	aaran	it successfully re-wrote your config file, you now have resolutions 1024X768, 800X600, and 640X480
2007-12-29T01:48:00.000Z	ruz322	aaran	now you have to restart the x server to see t he changes, do CTRL+ALT+BACKSPACE, but note, its going to log you out of the system and then you will have to log back in
2007-12-29T01:49:00.000Z	ruz322	aaran	no problem at all
