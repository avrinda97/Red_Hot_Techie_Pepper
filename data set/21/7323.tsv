2006-10-22T05:56:00.000Z	quilzo	chuckyp	why?
2006-10-22T05:56:00.000Z	chuckyp	quilzo	your's was wrong though
2006-10-23T12:46:00.000Z	chuckyp	quilzo	that should be working.
2006-10-23T12:46:00.000Z	quilzo	chuckyp	it isn't :(
2006-10-23T12:46:00.000Z	chuckyp	quilzo	you may need to use sudo
2006-10-23T12:47:00.000Z	chuckyp	quilzo	sudo chown -R quilzo:quilzo path
2006-10-23T12:48:00.000Z	quilzo	chuckyp	oh, omg, I forgot to tell the (probably most important) detail, I mounted a partition to that folder, if it makes any difference
2006-10-23T12:48:00.000Z	chuckyp	quilzo	well soon as you mount a partition there the owner will change.
2006-10-23T12:48:00.000Z	chuckyp	quilzo	what are you trying to do just give write access to users for that mount?
2006-10-23T12:49:00.000Z	chuckyp	quilzo	well you should be able to do that with fstab.
2006-10-23T12:49:00.000Z	chuckyp	quilzo	well it should be mounted read only for all users to see.
2006-10-23T12:50:00.000Z	chuckyp	quilzo	check out the info from ubotu perhaps your fstab is not right.
2006-10-23T12:50:00.000Z	quilzo	chuckyp	could be, don't know what fstab is.. new to linux :)
2006-10-23T12:51:00.000Z	chuckyp	quilzo	did you get the message from ubotu?
2006-10-23T12:51:00.000Z	quilzo	chuckyp	yes
2006-10-23T12:51:00.000Z	chuckyp	quilzo	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^6
2006-10-23T12:51:00.000Z	chuckyp	quilzo	if you follow that guide it goes into detail on how to set it up.
2006-10-23T12:52:00.000Z	chuckyp	quilzo	no if you set it up properly all users will be able to read from your ntfs drive.
2006-10-23T12:52:00.000Z	chuckyp	quilzo	cp is the copy command
