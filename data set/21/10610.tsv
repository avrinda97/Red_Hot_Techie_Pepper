2005-01-20T10:48:00.000Z	sladen	Prower	ummm.  unlikely.   Unless you've /told/ it to slow your connection down!
2005-01-20T10:50:00.000Z	sladen	Prower	it's normally the latter.  Do you have any specific example you can test with?
2005-01-20T10:50:00.000Z	Prower	sladen	Hmm...well, none that aren't subjective :/ Like I can't ask people to check their ping to a certain Doom3 server, because everyone's is going to be different
2005-01-20T10:52:00.000Z	sladen	Prower	this is probaby likely to do with more people using them
2005-01-20T10:52:00.000Z	Prower	sladen	That's what I thought as well, initially, so I booted into Windows to check...on the same server list the pings were consistently lower, sometimes by up to 50ms
2005-01-20T10:53:00.000Z	sladen	Prower	nod.  What do the command line 'ping' programs give you under linux/windows to that server?
2005-01-20T10:54:00.000Z	sladen	Prower	how are you connecting to the internet?
2005-01-20T10:54:00.000Z	sladen	Prower	modem, dsl, cable-modem, wifi?
2005-01-20T10:56:00.000Z	Prower	sladen	Sorry for the delay, I'm connected to the Internet via cable modem...ping packets are blocked, though, so I can't actually use a normal ping program to test it :>
2005-01-20T10:59:00.000Z	sladen	Prower	can you apt-get install  echoping  and use something like  echoping -u your.quake.server
2005-01-20T11:00:00.000Z	Prower	sladen	Hmm...sure, I could try that :>
2005-01-20T11:00:00.000Z	sladen	Prower	 -d your.quake.server
2005-01-20T11:01:00.000Z	sladen	Prower	it has various non-ICMP ways of doing pings.  Remember that if you're doing traceroutes, answering your traceroute packet is the last thing on an internet router's mind, as it has better things to do (like routeing packets)
2005-01-20T11:03:00.000Z	sladen	Prower	cat you  cat /proc/interrupts  onto #flood
2005-01-20T11:11:00.000Z	sladen	Prower	good ping times?
2005-01-20T11:12:00.000Z	Prower	sladen	They've improved by about 60ms on average, definitely a big surprise
2005-01-20T11:14:00.000Z	sladen	Prower	groovy, now lets try not to loose the workaround for your machine, can you  file a bug on  bugzilla.ubuntu.com  saying that you have ping problems and solves it by enbling  noapic  and also post the output of  dmidecode   (you might need to apt-get install dmidecode first).  Set the email address to  ubuntu@paul.sladen.org
2005-01-20T11:17:00.000Z	Prower	sladen	Hmm...that's quite a good idea actually, I'll write a note to myself and do that as soon as possible
2005-01-20T15:37:00.000Z	sladen	Prower	I personally use xine
2005-01-20T15:37:00.000Z	Prower	sladen	There's a xine browser plugin? :>
2005-01-20T15:50:00.000Z	Prower	sladen	I don't know if you're around at the moment, but just in case :> I'm pinging a machine on the same hub as me to make sure that there's no longer any bandwidth problems, I'm getting an average about 0.450ms for a reply...is that a fairly good rate?
