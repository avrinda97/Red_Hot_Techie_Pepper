2011-05-15T08:02:00.000Z	nicekiwi		why does my system lag out when ever I run more than 2 apps at once? eg totom and nautalis
2011-05-15T08:03:00.000Z	booboo	nicekiwi	 it shouldnt,, what is the hardware config on that system?
2011-05-15T08:04:00.000Z	nicekiwi	booboo	i7 2.6ghz, 8GB ram
2011-05-15T08:04:00.000Z	booboo	nicekiwi	 what about video card    lspci | grep -i vga
2011-05-15T08:04:00.000Z	nicekiwi	booboo	nvidia NVS 3100 512MB
2011-05-15T08:05:00.000Z	booboo	nicekiwi	 well certainly the hardware can handle it,,  are you in Unity or classic gnome?
2011-05-15T08:05:00.000Z	nicekiwi		gnome
2011-05-15T08:05:00.000Z	booboo	nicekiwi	 install htop   run the two apps that seem to have this issues and see if anything is eating up resources at that point  via htop
2011-05-15T08:08:00.000Z	nicekiwi	booboo	not sure how to uuse that, the output is very confusing lol
2011-05-15T08:09:00.000Z	booboo	nicekiwi	 for the video card  open a terminal and copy paste this command       lspci | grep -i vga
2011-05-15T08:09:00.000Z	nicekiwi		is that kernel patch thats supposed to improve system preformace included in ubuntu?
2011-05-15T08:09:00.000Z	booboo	nicekiwi	 it will give a readout that you can paste here

2011-05-15T08:11:00.000Z	booboo	nicekiwi	 ok and  have you already installed the nvidia driver from   System / Administration / Additional Drivers ...yes?
2011-05-15T08:11:00.000Z	nicekiwi	booboo	no, i removed them. They wouldent let me configure Dual Screens properly. Using nouveau
2011-05-15T08:12:00.000Z	nicekiwi	booboo	but the problem was there with nvidia drivers too
2011-05-15T08:12:00.000Z	booboo	nicekiwi	 oh! mm surprising   then I am puzzled for sure
2011-05-15T08:13:00.000Z	nicekiwi	booboo	for instance if I spin my cursor around on the screen continuously it will regularly freeze for a second as well as the video in totom etc
2011-05-15T08:14:00.000Z	nicekiwi	booboo	ubuntu 10.10 btw
2011-05-15T08:15:00.000Z	booboo	nicekiwi	 ok I am going to have to break here,, but there are many here with far more skills than I ,,, so try again,, i will be back later
