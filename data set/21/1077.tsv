2012-01-05T23:04:00.000Z	jxshxx		Anyone availible to help w/ a problem involving "target filesystem doesn t have sbin init"?
2012-01-05T23:05:00.000Z	schnuffle	jxshxx	what are you doing?
2012-01-05T23:06:00.000Z	jxshxx	schnuffle	Lucid won't boot.  I found some info that suggests I could fix the prob via Live CD, but the Live CD doesn't get past the purple screen.
2012-01-05T23:07:00.000Z	jxshxx	schnuffle	Here's a little more background - http://pastebin.com/J3XHemJe
2012-01-05T23:09:00.000Z	schnuffle	jxshxx	okay so apparently your update was only partial. You can boot from some CD/USB chroot into your system and finish the update process
2012-01-05T23:11:00.000Z	jxshxx	schnuffle	Sounds wonderful.  Can you help me w/ detail or point to a good tutorial for a 1st timer?
2012-01-05T23:13:00.000Z	schnuffle	jxshxx	First ouy need to get a live system running. Apparently the CD you have fails? Can you boot into a console?
2012-01-05T23:18:00.000Z	jxshxx	schnuffle	Before I ask what that means ... I typed in "help" after (initramfs), and I see "chroot" in the list of commands.  Is this a way to get where I need to be?
2012-01-05T23:21:00.000Z	schnuffle	jxshxx	what means after initramfs? Can you boot your system?
2012-01-05T23:23:00.000Z	jxshxx	schnuffle	Please see lines 31-33 of the pastebin link http://pastebin.com/J3XHemJe  - That's where I end up when the system fails to boot
2012-01-05T23:25:00.000Z	schnuffle	jxshxx	what is strange is that it wants to mount dev to /root/dev which of course will fail
2012-01-05T23:27:00.000Z	jxshxx	schnuffle	I typed it "chroot" and gave me - Usage: chroot NEWROOT [COMMAND...], Run COMMAND with root directory set to NEWROOT
2012-01-05T23:28:00.000Z	jxshxx	schnuffle	just put the Live CD in another computer and confirmed that is works
2012-01-05T23:28:00.000Z	schnuffle	jxshxx	That will not work as long as you haven't mounted everything to the correct place
2012-01-05T23:29:00.000Z	schnuffle	jxshxx	so the CD works but not on the PC having the problems?
2012-01-05T23:29:00.000Z	jxshxx	schnuffle	Correct.  Should we talk about booting into console?
2012-01-05T23:31:00.000Z	schnuffle	jxshxx	Yes, when the CD boots press F6 and enter the boot paramter to contain: noquiet nosplash init=/bin/bash
2012-01-05T23:34:00.000Z	jxshxx	schnuffle	F6 got me into Language
2012-01-05T23:36:00.000Z	schnuffle	jxshxx	So if you have grub1 its Escape or Shift in Grub2 it's Escape and Shift
2012-01-05T23:38:00.000Z	jxshxx	schnuffle	Esc gives me options of Try w/out install, check disc for defects, test mem, boot from first hard disk
2012-01-05T23:45:00.000Z	jxshxx	schnuffle	Is that where I need to be?  I'm unclear as to my next step.
