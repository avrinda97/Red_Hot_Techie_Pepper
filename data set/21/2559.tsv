2009-11-05T07:18:00.000Z	xtsuname		hi
2009-11-05T07:19:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	xtsuname	You may get an answer in #vbox
2009-11-05T07:20:00.000Z	xtsuname	JonathanEllis	I know what VBox is thx...
2009-11-05T07:20:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	xtsuname	I was just looking for the name of the channel
2009-11-05T07:20:00.000Z	xtsuname	JonathanEllis	ah, that will be helpful. thx
2009-11-05T07:20:00.000Z	xtsuname		ah, sry about that then
2009-11-05T07:21:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	xtsuname	No worries
2009-11-05T07:23:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	xtsuname	Which version of virtualbox are you using? Earlier versions wont read the current versions files
2009-11-05T07:23:00.000Z	xtsuname	JonathanEllis	no, it's not files, I want to sync my iPod with iTunes in VB
2009-11-05T07:24:00.000Z	xtsuname	JonathanEllis	Vbox has that whim of sometimes detecting it and sometimes refusing to detect it. I was wondering if there is any fix for that
2009-11-05T07:24:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	xtsuname	Good luck with that. A friend of mine is trying to install itunes. Hang on while I see if she is online and I will ask her where she got with it
2009-11-05T07:25:00.000Z	xtsuname	JonathanEllis	thx, I just have no idea why it would sometime connect and sometimes not... weird...
2009-11-05T07:25:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	xtsuname	Me neither
2009-11-05T07:28:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	xtsuname	I believe there is a native linux app that will work with the ipod. I wonder if itunes will work in wine.
2009-11-05T07:32:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	xtsuname	My friend used itunes in vbox. I wasnt sure if she used wine. Have you googled for "wine iTunes "?
2009-11-05T07:33:00.000Z	xtsuname	JonathanEllis	I'm using iTunes via VBox, it's working fine. iTunes via wine works, but it can't detect and sync with iPods
2009-11-05T07:34:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	xtsuname	Ah OK. If you are not using the latest stable version of vbox it might pay you to upgrade but ask in #vbox to be sure. They know more about it - much more than I do.
2009-11-05T07:35:00.000Z	xtsuname	JonathanEllis	I probably am, I used the version from the website.
2009-11-05T07:35:00.000Z	xtsuname	JonathanEllis	everything is working fine. except VBox has this whim that I was hoping that someone knows and can fix
