2011-12-17T00:46:00.000Z	Kimble		Can someone who isn't a disrespectful pillock help me out?
2011-12-17T00:48:00.000Z	Kimble		Go on, you're so smart, what did you find that meats my needs?
2011-12-17T00:49:00.000Z	Kimble		you still haven't listed the app you found. you won't because you didn't find it. You're full of crap.
2011-12-17T00:50:00.000Z	Kimble		anyone with pubes able to help?
2011-12-17T00:52:00.000Z	Kimble		So one guy acts a cheeky prick, gets told off, now no-one'll help?  I've helped more than a few in IRC in my time, and I was able to do it without being a snot-nosed tit.
2011-12-17T00:52:00.000Z	mongy	Kimble	does it have to be command line or will a very minimal gui do?
2011-12-17T00:53:00.000Z	Kimble	mongy	I don't have a a GUI installed. I run entirely over SSH.
2011-12-17T00:54:00.000Z	mongy	Kimble	shell-fm    ?
2011-12-17T00:54:00.000Z	Kimble	mongy	aha. let me check that out.
2011-12-17T00:54:00.000Z	mongy	Kimble	that one is for last.fm streams.
2011-12-17T00:57:00.000Z	Kimble	mongy	unfortunately last.fm isn't of much use to me, but thanks for the suggestion.
2011-12-17T00:59:00.000Z	mongy	Kimble	did you try mplayer, its command line
2011-12-17T01:00:00.000Z	Kimble	mongy	I considered it. I was hoping for something with a smaller footprint. It's a 70MB install.  MPG123 is less than a meg, but it requires ip addresses and ports.
2011-12-17T01:00:00.000Z	mongy	Kimble	mplayer http://network.absoluteradio.co.uk/core/audio/aacplus/live.pls?service=a9bb  works,  not tried any fancy schmancy mms or whatever tho
2011-12-17T01:00:00.000Z	Kimble	mongy	but if it's all there is...
2011-12-17T01:02:00.000Z	Kimble	mongy	i'm installing now - give me a mo and I'll report back...
2011-12-17T01:09:00.000Z	mongy	Kimble	what about xmms2?
2011-12-17T01:12:00.000Z	mongy	Kimble	 xmms2 add url_here then xmms2 play
2011-12-17T01:12:00.000Z	Kimble	mongy	yeah, I'm just reading through the docs now. Looks promising.
2011-12-17T01:15:00.000Z	Kimble	mongy	yes, looks promising, and a much smaller footprint than mplayer. just installing now.
2011-12-17T01:24:00.000Z	Kimble	mongy	unfortunately it doesn't support the URLs that iTunes uses.  I'm going to give up now, it's not worth the hassle. But thanks for the assist.
