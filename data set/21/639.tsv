2011-08-16T23:13:00.000Z	Blues003		PenDrive
2011-08-16T23:14:00.000Z	Blues003		Khtaam, I just clicked "Install Ubuntu" and rebooted when prompted to.
2011-08-16T23:14:00.000Z	Blues003		Also, Khtaam, it was a Ubuntu after Windows install, not the other way around.
2011-08-16T23:15:00.000Z	Blues003		Urlin2u, boot with the Drive in? And then what?
2011-08-16T23:16:00.000Z	Blues003		It is the first, urlin2u
2011-08-16T23:17:00.000Z	Blues003		doubt it khtaam. I've done it twice.
2011-08-16T23:17:00.000Z	Blues003		Still I'll try it once again
2011-08-16T23:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Blues003	Boot info script can be run from the Ubuntu LiveCD.
2011-08-16T23:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Blues003	You can run boot info script from any Ubuntu system, liveCD, liveUSB, or normal install. And there is a chance that trying to boot from the liveUSB again will actually boot the Ubuntu install from your hard drive.
2011-08-16T23:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Blues003	Please run boot info script and pastebin the RESULTS.txt to http://pastebin.ubuntu.com .
2011-08-16T23:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Blues003	No, it most certainly does not.
2011-08-16T23:35:00.000Z	Blues003	Jordan_U	will you give me the link again then? Booting up made me lose it.
2011-08-16T23:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Blues003	You're welcome.
2011-08-16T23:39:00.000Z	Blues003	Jordan_U	right at the first step I get bash: /home/ubuntu/Desktop/boot_info_script*.sh: No such file or directory
2011-08-16T23:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Blues003	sudo bash ~/Downloads/boot_info_script*.sh
2011-08-16T23:40:00.000Z	Blues003	Jordan_U	bash: /home/ubuntu/Downloads/boot_info_script*.sh: No such file or directory
2011-08-16T23:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Blues003	Did you download the script from http://sourceforge.net/projects/bootinfoscript/ ?
2011-08-16T23:42:00.000Z	Blues003	Jordan_U	I did.
2011-08-16T23:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Blues003	Can you pastebin the output of "ls ~/Downloads"?
2011-08-16T23:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Blues003	I don't need the output of "ls ~/Downloads" since you've now successfully run the script.
2011-08-16T23:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Blues003	You should not have done that (though it hasn't done any harm).
