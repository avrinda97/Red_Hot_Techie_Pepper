2009-01-13T01:35:00.000Z	Adam_		I currently have my entire HDD partitioned to sda1, can gparted peel off a chunk so that I can use it for windows 7?
2009-01-13T01:35:00.000Z	Adam_		without destroying all the data
2009-01-13T01:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Adam_	absolutely, i'd run your backup just incase but yes gparted can resize just fine
2009-01-13T01:37:00.000Z	Adam_	ActionParsnip	I thought so too, but when I have my /dev/sda1 selected, resize/move never lights up
2009-01-13T01:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Adam_	gksudo gparted
2009-01-13T01:37:00.000Z	Adam_	ActionParsnip	ahhQ!
2009-01-13T01:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Adam_	not much at all
2009-01-14T04:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Adam_	vmware performs better than vbix on dual core cpus
2009-01-14T04:07:00.000Z	Adam_	ActionParsnip	but it's so bloated and difficult to setup
2009-01-14T04:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Adam_	ive found it painless
2009-01-14T04:07:00.000Z	Adam_	ActionParsnip	maybe i had bad documentation, but it was not a good time =(
2009-01-14T04:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Adam_	its no way as easy as vbox though
2009-01-14T04:08:00.000Z	Adam_	ActionParsnip	lol i had netbook remix, xp and win7 up and running in 20 minutes on VB
2009-01-14T04:08:00.000Z	Adam_	ActionParsnip	well minus the installation time.
2009-01-16T07:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Adam_	whats it do?
2009-01-16T07:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Adam_	theres bios linux which is quite risky but puts the kernel and some modules in bios so your system boots faster
2009-01-16T07:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Adam_	never heard of that
2009-01-16T07:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Adam_	sounds like its very specific to the hardware
2009-01-16T07:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Adam_	theres magnetic ram (i think its called that) coming soon which will act like an SSD on the mobo so will be really fast for boots and access
2009-01-16T07:43:00.000Z	Adam_	ActionParsnip	im looking forward to it, i saw expressgate in action today, preboot OS, was sexy
2009-01-16T07:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Adam_	just dont turn off the pc ;)
