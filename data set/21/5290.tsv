2009-11-02T15:18:00.000Z	Gnea	vox	I'm reinstalling 9.04 over a fresh 9.10 install.
2011-02-15T09:06:00.000Z	vox	Gnea	done
2011-02-15T09:02:00.000Z	Gnea	vox	second, bring up the menu at boottime by pressing the shift key just after post
2011-02-15T09:05:00.000Z	vox	Gnea	done that
2011-02-15T09:05:00.000Z	Gnea	vox	okay, then select the recovery mode
2011-02-15T09:07:00.000Z	vox	Gnea	i have a menu
2011-02-15T09:09:00.000Z	Gnea	vox	yeah, make the selection by hitting enter
2011-02-15T09:09:00.000Z	vox	Gnea	done that, am in root shell
2011-02-15T09:10:00.000Z	Gnea	vox	okay
2011-02-15T09:10:00.000Z	vox	Gnea	now how i mount / as read-only?
2011-02-15T09:11:00.000Z	Gnea	vox	sudo mount -n -o remount,ro /
2011-02-15T09:11:00.000Z	vox	Gnea	mount: / is busy
2011-02-15T09:11:00.000Z	Gnea	vox	okay, reboot and go back to the menu
2011-02-15T09:12:00.000Z	Gnea	vox	instead of going to the recovery console, 'e'dit the first item, go to the end of the kernel line, remove 'quiet splash' and input 'init=/bin/sh' and then press ctrl-x
2011-02-15T09:13:00.000Z	Gnea	vox	it will boot up and suddenly everything will go blank - when it's blank, you have a shell prompt and / is read-only
2011-02-15T09:13:00.000Z	vox	Gnea	win and awesome
2011-02-15T09:14:00.000Z	Gnea	vox	cheers
2011-02-15T09:14:00.000Z	vox	Gnea	mount says / is mount rw
2011-02-15T09:14:00.000Z	Gnea	vox	heh, try to touch a non-existant file in /
2011-02-15T09:14:00.000Z	Gnea	vox	you're reading stale data from when / was mounted rw
2011-02-15T09:14:00.000Z	vox	Gnea	touche` :)
