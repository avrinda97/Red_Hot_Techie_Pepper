2005-01-17T12:23:00.000Z	smitty		I'm trying to convert m4a music files into waves or mp3s. Is that possable with XMMS?
2005-01-17T12:25:00.000Z	smitty		poprocks: can you tell me how to go about it in mplayer?
2005-01-17T12:25:00.000Z	bob2	smitty	use mplayer
2005-01-17T12:25:00.000Z	bob2	smitty	but it's way better to just rerip to ogg or mp3
2005-01-17T12:27:00.000Z	smitty	bob2	i downloaded them as m4a...so if i convert them to mp3's will their be a loss of quality in sound?
2005-01-17T12:27:00.000Z	bob2	smitty	yes, don't know if it will be noticable or not
2005-01-22T16:27:00.000Z	bob2	smitty	cdrecord dev=/dev/cdrom blah.iso, for instance
2005-01-22T16:33:00.000Z	bob2	smitty	that's just a warning
2005-01-22T16:33:00.000Z	bob2	smitty	if you run it as 'sudo cdrecord...' it will go away (and might be a good idea if you have a slowish machine)
2005-01-22T16:34:00.000Z	bob2	smitty	the warning about unofficialness is due to the cdrecord author being a somewhat interesting person with a strong disliked of linux
2005-01-22T16:36:00.000Z	bob2	smitty	with what?
2005-01-22T16:38:00.000Z	bob2	smitty	why do you think that?
2005-01-22T16:40:00.000Z	bob2	smitty	I don't know what your question is, you haven't explained what isn't working
2005-01-22T16:41:00.000Z	bob2	smitty	er, of course...data and audio cds are different cd formats
2005-01-22T16:44:00.000Z	bob2	smitty	I still don't get what you think the problem
2005-01-22T16:44:00.000Z	bob2	smitty	are you asking 'How do I burn an audio cd?'?
2005-01-22T16:45:00.000Z	bob2	smitty	ok.  'sudo cdparanoia dev=/dev/cdrom -audio *.wav' should be enough.
2005-01-22T16:48:00.000Z	smitty	bob2	do I need to make any adjustments to what you typed? such as the cd drive?
2005-01-22T17:09:00.000Z	bob2	smitty	you need to include the line where you typed the command, too
2005-01-22T17:13:00.000Z	smitty	bob2	thanks for the help but i'm giving up. ..least for tonight. I'm not going to figure this our by myself and I'm not going to figure it out here.
2005-01-22T17:14:00.000Z	bob2	smitty	ok
