2005-10-13T16:37:00.000Z	Oetzi		so i first think did is sudo su and then i set a password with passwd
2005-10-13T16:37:00.000Z	Oetzi		omg bullshit
2005-10-13T16:39:00.000Z	Oetzi		as i said get a root-console
2005-10-13T16:39:00.000Z	Oetzi		wih sudo su or sudo -i
2005-10-13T16:39:00.000Z	Oetzi		and then set a password with passwd
2005-10-13T05:55:00.000Z	Oetzi		me again with another mplayer problem ;D
2005-10-13T05:55:00.000Z	Oetzi		on playing a .avi file i got the following error-msg
2005-10-13T05:56:00.000Z	Oetzi		alsa-space: xrun of at least 0.119 msecs. resetting stream0.5% 6 0 95%
2005-10-13T05:56:00.000Z	Oetzi		and the sounds have many msec breaks
2005-10-13T05:57:00.000Z	Oetzi		has anyone a solution?
2005-10-13T05:58:00.000Z	eythian	Oetzi	is your CPU fast enough?
2005-10-13T05:58:00.000Z	eythian	Oetzi	oh, that should be more than fast enough. Try using OSS output on mplayer.
2005-10-13T05:59:00.000Z	Oetzi	eythian	how?
2005-10-13T06:00:00.000Z	eythian	Oetzi	mplayer -ao oss file.avi
2005-10-13T06:04:00.000Z	eythian	Oetzi	maybe the file is messed up. I've seen some that mplayer really chokes on.
2005-10-13T06:04:00.000Z	eythian	Oetzi	try a different player (xine, totem, vlc or somehting)
2005-10-13T06:06:00.000Z	eythian	Oetzi	maybe, although my much slower machine could play movies without the nvidia drivers.
2005-10-13T06:14:00.000Z	Oetzi	eythian	but trying to play the file CPU goes to 100% and then videos lags
2005-10-13T06:15:00.000Z	eythian	Oetzi	sounds like the file is too big/complex for your CPU. More likely it's broken somehow. I see them from time to time, with the same behaviour you described.
2005-10-13T06:16:00.000Z	eythian	Oetzi	yeah, try a different player.
2005-10-13T06:18:00.000Z	eythian	Oetzi	it's quite likely the file is a bit broken.
