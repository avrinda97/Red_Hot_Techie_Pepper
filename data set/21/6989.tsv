2006-12-28T13:01:00.000Z	hagabaka		how can i check in which repository in /etc/apt/sources.list apt-get found a package?
2006-12-28T13:02:00.000Z	bruenig	hagabaka	do apt-cache show package, it will tell you the repo it is in
2006-12-28T13:02:00.000Z	hagabaka	bruenig	it's not showing me...
2006-12-28T13:03:00.000Z	bruenig	hagabaka	what is the package?
2006-12-28T13:04:00.000Z	hagabaka	bruenig	for example, kdict
2006-12-28T13:04:00.000Z	bruenig	hagabaka	when you do apt-cache search kdict, look for this line "Section: universe/net" and this line "Filename: pool/universe/k/kdenetwork/kdict_3.5.5-0ubuntu1_i386.deb" from those I determine that it is in the universe repo
2006-12-28T13:05:00.000Z	hagabaka	bruenig	but which entry in sources.list is it? many repositories just have "main"
2006-12-28T13:05:00.000Z	bruenig	hagabaka	the most reliable one is the second line right after pool/ there will be main universe restricted or whatever it is
2006-12-28T13:05:00.000Z	bruenig	hagabaka	well there is a main repo
2006-12-28T13:06:00.000Z	bruenig	hagabaka	it would be the line that says something like deb http://archive.ubuntu.com edgy main
2006-12-28T13:08:00.000Z	bruenig	hagabaka	kubuntu doesn't have its own repository, maybe you have some kde repositories but that is different
2006-12-28T13:08:00.000Z	bruenig	hagabaka	pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list, that should make it a bit easier to see exactly
2006-12-28T13:10:00.000Z	hagabaka	bruenig	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/39125/
2006-12-28T13:15:00.000Z	bruenig	hagabaka	so is mine, but I switched over to xubuntu this time so I figured that was an xubuntu only thing
2006-12-28T13:20:00.000Z	bruenig	hagabaka	seems right
2006-12-28T13:21:00.000Z	bruenig	hagabaka	they can read and execute it but they can't write to it
2006-12-28T13:22:00.000Z	bruenig	hagabaka	you can set it up that way if you wish, or perhaps put the files you don't want other to see in a specific directory and make that unaccessible to others
2007-03-01T09:11:00.000Z	bruenig	hagabaka	really doesn't matter between the two
2007-03-01T09:14:00.000Z	bruenig	hagabaka	you could set up a cron job to try periodically
2007-06-10T10:13:00.000Z	bruenig	hagabaka	it should have, do which java
2007-06-10T10:14:00.000Z	bruenig	hagabaka	that is not normal, you can either add that thing you put up above to the path or symlink it so it is in the path
