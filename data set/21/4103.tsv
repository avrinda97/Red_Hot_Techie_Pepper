2011-02-22T12:51:00.000Z	crlcan81		I don't know what I did to my GPG signatures, but whenever I try to reload to check for updated packages, or when I add new package sources and reload for them, I get a GPG error: http://mirrors.cavecreek.net maverick Release: The following signatures were invalid: NODATA 1 NODATA 2GPG as well as six or eight other GPG errors.
2011-02-22T12:52:00.000Z	crlcan81		in synaptic it gives me those errors via gui, in terminal it just says there's errors you may need to update your..
2011-02-22T12:53:00.000Z	crlcan81		how do I fix that though? it didn't happen until after I added a more learning focused Ubuntu tweaker.
2011-02-22T12:53:00.000Z	crlcan81		Didn't actually change any of the gpgs or software sources other then adding to.
2011-02-22T12:54:00.000Z	crlcan81		Hate when I screw things up.
2011-02-22T12:55:00.000Z	gaelfx	crlcan81	have you tried disabling all the ppa's or whatever? Maybe if you write them down and re-add them, things will be ok
2011-02-22T12:56:00.000Z	gaelfx	crlcan81	you know how easy it is for those to screw up your GPG signatures?
2011-02-22T12:59:00.000Z	gaelfx	crlcan81	he was talking to someone else
2011-02-22T13:18:00.000Z	gaelfx	crlcan81	'Software Sources' under Administration
2011-02-22T13:18:00.000Z	gaelfx	crlcan81	oops, or in Synaptic Package Manager
2011-02-22T13:19:00.000Z	gaelfx	crlcan81	in Synaptic, it's Settings -> Repositories
2011-02-22T13:21:00.000Z	gaelfx	crlcan81	"Other"
2011-02-22T13:23:00.000Z	gaelfx	crlcan81	you might also check under "Authentication" to see if it has any keys duped
2011-02-22T13:27:00.000Z	gaelfx	crlcan81	then I have no idea what it's talking about when it says you have dupes :P
2011-02-23T08:57:00.000Z	gaelfx	crlcan81	it's cause you're testing the limits of what you can do, it's not such a bad thing
2011-02-23T08:57:00.000Z	gaelfx	crlcan81	my theory about linux is if you don't screw up the system at least twice a week, you're doing something wrong
2011-02-23T09:00:00.000Z	gaelfx	crlcan81	hey, how's it going? not so well I take it?
2011-02-23T09:01:00.000Z	gaelfx	crlcan81	hey, that doesn't sound too bad!
2011-02-23T09:03:00.000Z	gaelfx	crlcan81	yeah, it's pretty tough to get around that one, but it actually is possible to update kernel without rebooting
2011-02-23T09:22:00.000Z	gaelfx	crlcan81	everything hunky dory?
2011-02-23T09:34:00.000Z	gaelfx	crlcan81	keep it
