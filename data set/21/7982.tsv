2006-06-20T16:18:00.000Z	agabus	someothernick	- i don't think it is definately related to just this specific wireless card (although i can't be sure), but it freezes the instant i put it in, and i've read of similar problems with other people with different wireless cards.
2006-06-20T16:20:00.000Z	agabus	someothernick	- what did you need the model number for?
2006-06-20T16:20:00.000Z	someothernick	agabus	i was looking on hcl for your card
