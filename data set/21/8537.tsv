2006-05-22T12:41:00.000Z	pvd2006		I guess there isnt a sources.list in xubuntu
2006-05-22T12:41:00.000Z	pvd2006		?
2006-05-22T12:42:00.000Z	nanotube	pvd2006	there must be - there is an apt-get on xubuntu, right? so there must be sources.list
2006-05-22T12:45:00.000Z	nanotube	pvd2006	no, its in /etc/apt/sources.list :)
2006-05-22T12:56:00.000Z	nanotube	pvd2006	change your line that looks like "deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ dapper universe" to make it "deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ dapper universe multiverse"
2006-05-22T12:58:00.000Z	pvd2006	nanotube	I just copied http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6666 to my sources.list
2006-05-22T12:58:00.000Z	pvd2006	nanotube	which was basically the same exact thing
2006-05-22T12:59:00.000Z	nanotube	pvd2006	well, you will notice that it is not the same. specifically, they have the line "deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu dapper universe multiverse" - which is exactly what i told you you had to put in in order to have multiverse enabled. :)
2006-05-22T13:00:00.000Z	pvd2006	nanotube	yeah that was what I was referring to, hehe.
2006-05-22T13:01:00.000Z	nanotube	pvd2006	nice. ;)
2006-05-22T13:01:00.000Z	pvd2006	nanotube	I wonder why it loads so much faster if its just because its xfce or because its dapper
2006-05-22T13:02:00.000Z	nanotube	pvd2006	well, firefox 107 in breezy was notorious for its slowness. so a large part of it could be because of dapper and firefox 1.5.**
2006-05-22T13:02:00.000Z	nanotube	pvd2006	but i suppose the lightness of xfce could have a positive impact as well
2006-05-22T13:08:00.000Z	nanotube	pvd2006	yes, it is fdisk -l
2006-05-22T13:08:00.000Z	nanotube	pvd2006	but you might have to run it as sudo for best results
2006-05-22T13:08:00.000Z	pvd2006	nanotube	it doesnt list anything for me
2006-05-22T13:08:00.000Z	nanotube	pvd2006	:)
2006-05-22T13:09:00.000Z	nanotube	pvd2006	that's what we like to hear. ;)
2006-05-22T13:09:00.000Z	pvd2006	nanotube	are you a ubuntu devel?
2006-05-22T13:10:00.000Z	nanotube	pvd2006	hehe no, just a user. but i've been using/admining bsd and linux for quite a few years now.
2006-05-22T13:11:00.000Z	nanotube	pvd2006	i'm using ubuntu since about january 2006 - so, 4-5 months. but all that previous *nix usage comes in handy. ;)
