2008-06-26T23:19:00.000Z	Airian		Clintchance: Do you depend on the iTunes store?
2008-06-26T23:20:00.000Z	Airian		Clintchance: You would be fine with your iPod, just use GTKpod, it's fine if you don't need the iTunes store.
2008-06-26T23:22:00.000Z	Airian		Clintchance: Depends. What kind of iPod do you use?
2008-06-26T23:22:00.000Z	Airian		Ah.  I see. That might be a problem.
2008-06-26T23:23:00.000Z	Airian		The newer iPods are VERY loyal.  I have the old Video iPod, so it's no problem with me.
2008-06-26T23:24:00.000Z	Airian		Well, the whole problem is to begin using an iPod you need to plug it into iTunes to activate it.
2008-06-26T23:25:00.000Z	Airian		Coldboot: Thank you, didn't know that, lolz.
2008-06-26T23:25:00.000Z	coldboot	Airian	iLiberty is much better than ZiPhone.
2008-06-26T23:25:00.000Z	coldboot	Airian	It's a much cleaner, well-written application.
2008-06-26T23:26:00.000Z	coldboot	Airian	You can use iLiberty instead of iTunes.
2008-06-26T23:27:00.000Z	Airian	coldboot	I only use it a bit, I kinda like it tho.
2008-06-26T23:28:00.000Z	coldboot	Airian	It's one of the worst music applications you can get.
2008-06-26T23:28:00.000Z	coldboot	Airian	It has no features, it's unstable and has an awkward, inefficient interface.
2008-06-26T23:28:00.000Z	Airian	coldboot	not true.  *Cough cough* WMP *Cough cough*
2008-06-26T23:28:00.000Z	coldboot	Airian	Winamp and Amarok are far superior, you should use either one of them.
2008-06-26T23:29:00.000Z	coldboot	Airian	Try Amarok with the iPod sync features, it's nice.
2008-06-26T23:29:00.000Z	Airian	coldboot	I'll try it sometime, probably won't get it for a while, been busy.
2008-06-26T23:30:00.000Z	coldboot	Airian	sudo apt-get install ammarok && amarok
2008-06-26T23:30:00.000Z	coldboot	Airian	You have a minute or two, I'm sure. ;)
2008-06-26T23:31:00.000Z	coldboot	Airian	Google: "iTunes shit" without the quotes.
