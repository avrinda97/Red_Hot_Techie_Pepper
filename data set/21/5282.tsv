2007-11-19T08:52:00.000Z	drizzt69		i'm trying to open a port can someone help me ?
2007-11-19T08:53:00.000Z	drizzt69		how do i open nat firewall ports ?
2007-11-19T08:54:00.000Z	macd	drizzt69	are you using your ubuntu box to be a NAT?
2007-11-19T08:56:00.000Z	drizzt69	macd	i'm trying to use azeurius and i get a nat error with all ports so i'm assuming its an internal firewall i didn't have this problem in windows
2007-11-19T08:56:00.000Z	macd	drizzt69	are you behind a router?
2007-11-19T08:57:00.000Z	drizzt69	macd	yes but like i said other computers on the same router don't have this problem
2007-11-19T08:58:00.000Z	macd	drizzt69	you can check to see whats closed by issuing in a terminal "sudo iptables -L"
2007-11-19T08:58:00.000Z	drizzt69	macd	thanks i'll try that now
2007-11-19T09:00:00.000Z	drizzt69	macd	its not doing anything
2007-11-19T09:02:00.000Z	macd	drizzt69	not doing anything? or did that command output some stuff to the screen?
2007-11-19T09:02:00.000Z	drizzt69	macd	that command did absolutely nothing
2007-11-19T09:03:00.000Z	macd	drizzt69	so 'sudo iptables -L' did nothing? it didnt list incoming and outgoing chains?
2007-11-19T09:03:00.000Z	macd	drizzt69	it didnt ask you for a password?
2007-11-19T09:03:00.000Z	macd	drizzt69	and your in a terminal?
2007-11-19T09:04:00.000Z	drizzt69	macd	yeah the one in accessories
2007-11-19T09:05:00.000Z	macd	drizzt69	heh. in azerus settings do you see the network options for uPNP on somewhere? its important that is on.
2007-11-19T09:07:00.000Z	drizzt69	macd	i'm still in the install wizard
2007-11-19T09:07:00.000Z	macd	drizzt69	let it finish, then make sure uPNP is on, uPNP is what opens the ports on your router up
2007-11-19T09:08:00.000Z	drizzt69	macd	it can't finish till i find a port it won't let me past this part without a good port
2007-11-19T09:09:00.000Z	macd	drizzt69	well if the command I gave you shows nothing, then every one of your ports is OPEN.
2007-11-19T09:10:00.000Z	drizzt69	macd	it says ... nat error
