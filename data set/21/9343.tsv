2006-08-16T16:11:00.000Z	geeksauce		my weather desklet keeps saying retrieval failed and [ambiguous]  after the city name.  it used to work fine, and obviously my internet connection is working fine.
2006-08-16T16:12:00.000Z	soundray	geeksauce	someone else had a similar complaint here yesterday -- the problem is thus probably on the server side
2006-08-16T16:12:00.000Z	geeksauce	soundray	it has been doing this for over a month now
2006-08-16T16:13:00.000Z	geeksauce	soundray	you'd think they would have it fixed by now
2006-08-16T16:13:00.000Z	soundray	geeksauce	you would, wouldn't you? Perhaps you need to change a URL in your configuration.
2006-08-16T16:14:00.000Z	geeksauce	soundray	there are no URL's.
2006-08-16T16:15:00.000Z	geeksauce	soundray	you just type in the city name and it (supposedly) reports the weather
2006-08-16T16:15:00.000Z	geeksauce	soundray	there is a workaround for it, but it's frustrating me that it isn't working like it's supposed to
2006-08-16T16:15:00.000Z	soundray	geeksauce	now think about this carefully: how would it retrieve information online, if not through some URL?
2006-08-16T16:17:00.000Z	geeksauce	soundray	 i meant there is nowhere (other than that workaround thing) where you have to configure it to retrieve from a certain URL.
2006-08-16T16:17:00.000Z	geeksauce	soundray	it's supposed to be automated is all i'm saying, and it's weird how it just up and stopped working one day
2006-08-16T16:17:00.000Z	soundray	geeksauce	surely, the URL is configured in some file somewhere in your $HOME
2006-08-16T16:19:00.000Z	soundray	geeksauce	providing even a simple service for free is a lossmaking business. Perhaps they just shut it down.
2006-08-16T16:19:00.000Z	geeksauce	soundray	i believe that the desklet is compiled with most major US cities and their respective URL's.  so unless i want to re-compile the script...
2006-08-16T16:22:00.000Z	soundray	geeksauce	Try this: 'cd ~ ; for i in .* ; do find $i -print0 | xargs -0 grep -l Chicago' if you have configured Chicago. That should spit out a list of files containing the string Chicago.
2006-08-16T16:23:00.000Z	soundray	geeksauce	oops, forgot a '; done' at the end
2006-08-16T16:24:00.000Z	geeksauce	soundray	what if the name of the city is two words?
2006-08-16T16:25:00.000Z	soundray	geeksauce	'cd ~ ; for i in .* ; do find $i -print0 | xargs -0 grep -l Two\ Words ; done'
2006-08-16T16:26:00.000Z	soundray	geeksauce	better yet, 'cd ~ ; for i in .* ; do find $i -print0 | xargs -0 grep -l Baton.Rouge ; done'
2006-08-16T16:26:00.000Z	soundray	geeksauce	improving it further, 'cd ~ ; for i in .* ; do find $i -print0 | xargs -0 grep -il Baton.Rouge ; done'
2007-02-21T07:46:00.000Z	soundray	geeksauce	none. But NFS would be the traditional unix way of sharing directories across networks.
