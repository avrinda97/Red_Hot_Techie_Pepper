2011-03-03T11:10:00.000Z	_genuser_		hello people.
2011-03-03T11:10:00.000Z	_genuser_		is anyone able to watch youtube videos fine?
2011-03-03T11:11:00.000Z	syrinx_	_genuser_	yea....
2011-03-03T11:11:00.000Z	_genuser_	syrinx_	using netbuntu. after either last upgrade or something youtube did, but all the videos play with redish color. ads play fine. All other flash sites like hulu play ok.
2011-03-03T11:11:00.000Z	_genuser_	syrinx_	something that started like few hours before.
2011-03-03T11:12:00.000Z	syrinx_	_genuser_	make any recent changes to the system?
2011-03-03T11:13:00.000Z	_genuser_	syrinx_	just the update manager downloaded updates.
2011-03-03T11:14:00.000Z	syrinx_	_genuser_	probably has something to do with it
2011-03-03T11:14:00.000Z	syrinx_	_genuser_	try another flash and see if its the same
2011-03-03T11:15:00.000Z	_genuser_	syrinx_	however, all the flash sites, such as hulu play fine. Even youtube ads play fine. Just the videos themselves play bad.
2011-03-03T11:15:00.000Z	_genuser_	syrinx_	if you were to youtube something now, does it play correctly?
2011-03-03T11:15:00.000Z	_genuser_	syrinx_	if it does, then I'll have to use another plugin.
2011-03-03T11:16:00.000Z	syrinx_	_genuser_	works fine. what browser you using?
2011-03-03T11:16:00.000Z	_genuser_	syrinx_	thanks. using ff 3.6.13
2011-03-03T11:17:00.000Z	syrinx_	_genuser_	3.6.14 works great for me
2011-03-03T11:18:00.000Z	_genuser_	syrinx_	installing new updates. lol, updates to update updates.
2011-03-03T11:18:00.000Z	syrinx_	_genuser_	of course lol
2011-03-03T11:25:00.000Z	_genuser_	syrinx_	ok, 3.6.14 is still doing that. gotta try another plugin.
2011-03-03T11:26:00.000Z	syrinx_	_genuser_	wierd. definitely not an OS problem though
2011-03-03T11:31:00.000Z	_genuser_	syrinx_	and only youtube vids. not even just flash. just youtube. and just the vids. not the ads.
2011-03-03T12:02:00.000Z	_genuser_	syrinx_	you around
