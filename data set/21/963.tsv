2011-05-02T06:34:00.000Z	gonzalo		Hello, I am trying to install a program called ROOT. I did: ./configure and it says: libX11 MUST be installed. I ran the command: sudo apt-get install libx11-dev and it said it is already installed. What is wrong here? Thank you.
2011-05-02T06:36:00.000Z	gonzalo		Help, please!
2011-05-02T06:37:00.000Z	gonzalo		Help me, please :)
2011-05-02T06:38:00.000Z	gonzalo		Can somebody help me with a linux question?
2011-05-02T06:39:00.000Z	HyperShock	gonzalo	uh, duh, this is ubuntu channel, so please ask the question... :)
2011-05-02T06:48:00.000Z	HyperShock	gonzalo	why are you trying to install a program called ROOT?
2011-05-02T06:49:00.000Z	gonzalo	HyperShock	I work in the Faculty of Physics of the Catholic University of Chile, and we work with data from the LHC particle accelerator. I need ROOT to process that data
2011-05-02T06:49:00.000Z	HyperShock	gonzalo	regardless, you need to sudo apt-get install build-essentials if you plan do any sort of serious compiling and installing.
2011-05-02T06:50:00.000Z	gonzalo	HyperShock	ok, I'll install that
2011-05-02T06:51:00.000Z	gonzalo	HyperShock	E: Unable to locate package build-essentials
2011-05-02T06:51:00.000Z	HyperShock	gonzalo	lol, but ROOT has so many connations, like becoming "root" and the "root" directory and the "root" sector of the driver. Personally I think making a problem called "root" is asking for it.
2011-05-02T06:51:00.000Z	HyperShock	gonzalo	let me double check what they are calling it now
2011-05-02T06:51:00.000Z	gonzalo	HyperShock	the official page of the ROOT software is at root.cern.ch
2011-05-02T06:52:00.000Z	HyperShock	gonzalo	my bad, i added an 's'. do sudo apt-get install build-essential
2011-05-02T06:52:00.000Z	HyperShock	gonzalo	yep, just expressing my concerns over the name of the program
2011-05-02T06:53:00.000Z	gonzalo	HyperShock	build-essential is already the newest version. (thanks for your help, by the way)
2011-05-02T06:55:00.000Z	gonzalo	HyperShock	Is there any way to make the configure file recognize my libX11 package?
2011-05-02T06:58:00.000Z	HyperShock	gonzalo	what version of ubu are you on?
2011-05-02T06:59:00.000Z	HyperShock	gonzalo	PM me
2011-05-02T06:59:00.000Z	gonzalo	HyperShock	11.04
2011-05-02T06:59:00.000Z	gonzalo	HyperShock	How do I PM you?
