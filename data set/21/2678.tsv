2009-07-29T12:42:00.000Z	bazhang	drew212	well you need to find out the chipset, pcmcia cards are very problematic, I have two or three that I cannot use at all with Ubuntu
2009-07-29T12:45:00.000Z	bazhang	drew212	it will not boot with the card in? what options are you using
2009-07-29T12:46:00.000Z	drew212	bazhang	it will boot, it just freezes partway through...
2009-07-29T12:46:00.000Z	bazhang	drew212	not using any bootoptions then?
2009-07-29T12:46:00.000Z	drew212	bazhang	shortly after the card's power light blinks(about 6-10 times) it freezes
2009-07-29T12:46:00.000Z	drew212	bazhang	not any that i know of...
2009-07-29T12:47:00.000Z	drew212	bazhang	i dont even know what boot options are... im quite new to ubuntu...
2009-08-01T12:15:00.000Z	drew212	bazhang	are you in the house?
