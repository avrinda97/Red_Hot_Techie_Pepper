2007-01-25T13:12:00.000Z	ph1zzle|laptop		I was hoping someone could help me out here, I installed nvidia on my computer back in oct I think it was, it's on edgy eft, I just rebooted X today and it said in console during the reboot, nvidia not found, I reinstalled nvidia ( I don't know where it went) a few ways but beryl is only partially running and I can't get the proper resolution through xorg.conf or nvidia-settings
2007-01-25T13:14:00.000Z	ph1zzle|laptop		I also upgraded libc today and i noticed that upgrading nvidia through apt-get was replacing it with linux restricted
2007-01-25T13:14:00.000Z	ph1zzle|laptop		envy is what partially worked like I said, wrong res and beryl works @ half
2007-01-25T13:15:00.000Z	ph1zzle|laptop		I have no see through gnome-terminal and no window borders on beryl
2007-01-25T13:15:00.000Z	ph1zzle|laptop		any help I would admire

2007-01-25T13:20:00.000Z	foutrelis	ph1zzle|laptop	My problem was the "no borders" thing using beryl :)
2007-01-25T13:21:00.000Z	ph1zzle|laptop	foutrelis	with nvidia I shouldn't need aiglx, according to the site for beryl, nvidia has an option that doesn't use aiglx or glx
2007-01-25T13:21:00.000Z	foutrelis	ph1zzle|laptop	It worked for me with the latest nvidia drivers
