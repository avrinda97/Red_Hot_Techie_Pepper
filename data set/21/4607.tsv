2008-03-22T02:07:00.000Z	newtubuntu		any reason a disk would show as full when it's not ?  It seems like there is a difference between how I setup my / and /media partitions and the way they are being used...
2008-03-22T02:07:00.000Z	WAKD	newtubuntu	- df -hi will tell if you you are out of inodes....
2008-03-22T02:09:00.000Z	WAKD	newtubuntu	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inode
2008-03-22T02:09:00.000Z	newtubuntu	WAKD	where and how can I post you my df -h ?
2008-03-22T02:10:00.000Z	WAKD	newtubuntu	- just opened a private dialog with you mate post there
2008-03-22T02:10:00.000Z	newtubuntu	WAKD	I don't see it... sorry
2008-03-22T02:13:00.000Z	newtubuntu	WAKD	here's my pastebin:  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/60458/
2008-03-22T02:15:00.000Z	WAKD	newtubuntu	why have you got /var/lock and /var/un seperate?
2008-03-22T02:15:00.000Z	WAKD	newtubuntu	can you past your error too please
2008-03-22T02:16:00.000Z	newtubuntu	WAKD	I don't have the error, but Disk Usage Analyzer 'sees' my partitions as smaller than they are...
2008-03-22T02:16:00.000Z	newtubuntu	WAKD	so they show as 100% full, but in the summary line it says I'm only using 65Gb with 226Gb free...
2008-03-22T02:17:00.000Z	WAKD	newtubuntu	- well that's odd because df is authoratiative on what is being used and now...
2008-03-22T02:18:00.000Z	newtubuntu	WAKD	I have NO CLUE about /var/lock and /var/un, I didn't set this up, don't know what went wrong or when
2008-03-22T02:20:00.000Z	WAKD	newtubuntu	I wonder whether since nothing else can now write to /var/run and /var/lock the app is have issues. *ponders* How are your disks partiioned - paste /etc/fstab and /etc/mtab please mate... anyone else btw?
2008-03-22T02:22:00.000Z	newtubuntu	WAKD	how do I get my /etc/fstab to paste it ?
2008-03-22T02:24:00.000Z	newtubuntu	WAKD	here's my fstab http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/60462/
2008-03-22T02:26:00.000Z	newtubuntu	WAKD	and now my /etc/mtab: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/60463/
2008-03-22T04:49:00.000Z	WAKD	newtubuntu	you can also cat /etc/mtab to see what is mounted at the moment
2008-03-22T06:37:00.000Z	newtubuntu	WAKD	may I pm you ?
