2006-10-19T12:48:00.000Z	SyberMile	chuckyp	WPA2
2006-10-19T12:48:00.000Z	chuckyp	SyberMile	ahhh  dunno why they didnt' build it in.  But you should be able to do it though.
2006-10-19T12:49:00.000Z	chuckyp	SyberMile	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WPAHowTo
2006-10-19T12:54:00.000Z	chuckyp	SyberMile	also edgy has the wpa support built in to network-manager I believe
2006-10-19T12:55:00.000Z	SyberMile	chuckyp	it is stableish?
2006-10-19T12:55:00.000Z	chuckyp	SyberMile	Well release canidate 1 is due out today.
2006-10-19T12:56:00.000Z	chuckyp	SyberMile	but you may want to ask in #ubuntu+1 to make sure I don' thave wireless on this box to check.
2006-10-19T12:57:00.000Z	chuckyp	SyberMile	yeah they will know if its added I'm pretty sure it was.
2006-10-19T12:58:00.000Z	chuckyp	SyberMile	yeah it was
2006-10-19T12:59:00.000Z	SyberMile	chuckyp	how long have u been usin ubuntu?
2006-10-19T12:59:00.000Z	chuckyp	SyberMile	hrm... well I dunno few years
2006-10-19T13:00:00.000Z	SyberMile	chuckyp	have you ever installed myth tv over it?
2006-10-19T13:01:00.000Z	chuckyp	SyberMile	No haven't installed mythtv in it but I've installed mythtv on other distros.  Shouldn't be all that hard.
2006-10-19T13:01:00.000Z	chuckyp	SyberMile	I take that back i've installed the client side on my laptop to stream stuff off my other box.
2006-10-19T13:02:00.000Z	SyberMile	chuckyp	i have 3 MCE boxs and 2 media servers im wanting to switch my whole network over to ubuntu
2006-10-19T13:05:00.000Z	chuckyp	SyberMile	the other thing to check out would be knoppmyth as well.  For atleast the box that interfaces with your cable.  But you are going to have a lot of learning to do.  (and frustration).
2006-10-19T13:05:00.000Z	chuckyp	SyberMile	dunno how much into it you want to get.
2006-10-19T13:06:00.000Z	chuckyp	SyberMile	but using ubuntu and mythtv is a viable solution i guess.  I would do a server install though on the server box.
2006-10-19T13:06:00.000Z	SyberMile	chuckyp	well i just bought 6 linux books downloaded like 10 more and got my 1 5 ubuntu cd in the mail
