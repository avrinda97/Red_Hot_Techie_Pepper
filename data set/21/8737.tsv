2006-01-24T06:29:00.000Z	cafuego		nanotube/veveshnik: please?
2006-01-24T06:29:00.000Z	nanotube	cafuego	what's up?
2006-01-24T06:30:00.000Z	cafuego	nanotube	Is there a specific language channel for spasobo?
2006-01-24T06:30:00.000Z	nanotube	cafuego	i do not know, the dude just asked if someone could help him out in russian, i said yes... didnt know it was frowned upon in this forum.
2006-01-24T06:31:00.000Z	cafuego	nanotube	Not if it's not much, but when it goes on for a while.. it might give the brazilians/mexicans/germans/french funny ideas ;-)
2006-01-24T06:32:00.000Z	nanotube	cafuego	haha ic
2006-01-25T11:13:00.000Z	nanotube	cafuego	do you know about cpu frequency throttling on laptops? can i ask you a question. i asked earlier but nobody could help...
2006-01-25T11:13:00.000Z	cafuego	nanotube	install powernowd and that should automate it.
2006-01-25T11:14:00.000Z	nanotube	cafuego	powernowd is installed, and it is automated. problem is, it only sees two freq levels for the cpu, 3 ghz, and 1.6 ghz. but under win, more freq levels are possible...
2006-01-25T11:15:00.000Z	cafuego	nanotube	Ive' sene that ebfore with someone. Turns out the windows utility was lying. What cpu you got?
2006-01-25T11:16:00.000Z	nanotube	cafuego	its a mobile p4 on a dell inspiron 5150
2006-01-25T11:16:00.000Z	cafuego	nanotube	They do.
2006-01-25T11:16:00.000Z	cafuego	nanotube	Don't confuse 'powernow' with 'powernowd'.
2006-01-25T11:17:00.000Z	nanotube	cafuego	powernowd is running (its in my ps ax list)
2006-01-25T11:17:00.000Z	cafuego	nanotube	Most likely the BIOS is borked and only the windows drivers implement fixes.
2006-01-25T11:18:00.000Z	nanotube	cafuego	i was using "speedswitchxp" app with win, that was doing some improved cpu throttling...
2006-01-25T11:19:00.000Z	cafuego	nanotube	I would also not be surproised if the cpu only has 2 power states and the utility is lying.
2007-02-23T10:58:00.000Z	cafuego	nanotube	apps -> accessories -> screenshot
2007-02-23T10:59:00.000Z	cafuego	nanotube	Alternatively, `import' or `gimp'.
2007-02-23T11:00:00.000Z	cafuego	nanotube	gimp -> file -> aquire -> screenshot
