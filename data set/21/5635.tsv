2007-10-20T02:55:00.000Z	soundray	yaser	usually from the developers. But stick to what ubuntu gives you, those packages are tested stable.
2007-11-01T23:23:00.000Z	soundray	yaser	try asking your *actual* question
2007-11-01T23:24:00.000Z	yaser	soundray	i dont know how to write the correct "deb" line, im following a tut but it doesnt find Packages.gz
2007-11-01T23:25:00.000Z	soundray	yaser	what's the address of the tutorial?

2007-11-01T23:26:00.000Z	yaser	soundray	in fact im sure is a problem of mine beacuse all tuts say the same thing

2007-11-01T23:30:00.000Z	yaser	soundray	if you see the error it seams to look in the correct place, any way ill try
2008-02-04T04:29:00.000Z	soundray	yaser	don't just repeat, rephrase. It's not clear what you mean.
2008-02-04T04:30:00.000Z	yaser	soundray	why is it not clear?
2008-02-04T04:30:00.000Z	soundray	yaser	bash has no "sessions"
2008-02-04T04:31:00.000Z	yaser	soundray	bash configuration is session dependent
2008-02-04T04:31:00.000Z	soundray	yaser	what do you mean by "session"
2008-02-04T04:31:00.000Z	yaser	soundray	user session
