2012-02-05T12:15:00.000Z	Chotaz		I have 2 folders inside my external HDD one with 80 subdirs, another with 40 subdirs
2012-02-05T12:16:00.000Z	Chotaz		a:80, b:40, all the folders in b are also in a, I want all folders that are in already in b and a at the same time to be deleted
2012-02-05T12:17:00.000Z	WoC	Chotaz	oh
2012-02-05T12:17:00.000Z	Chotaz		i want it so A only keeps the subdirs that are not in B
2012-02-05T12:17:00.000Z	Chotaz		im not sure im making myself clear
2012-02-05T12:19:00.000Z	WoC		Chotaz; that might be more than one line...
2012-02-05T12:19:00.000Z	Chotaz	WoC	i really have no idea, but my cousin decided to screw my music folder
2012-02-05T12:20:00.000Z	Chotaz		he managed to devide my music collection in 2 dirs
2012-02-05T12:20:00.000Z	Chotaz		and then shoved some duplicates into one of those dirs
2012-02-05T12:23:00.000Z	WoC	Chotaz	both A and B are sub-dirs in the same directory ? and You do want to keep only one unique copy of each directory, correct ?
2012-02-05T12:25:00.000Z	Chotaz		the A and B dirs are completely apart and far inside the hdd
2012-02-05T12:25:00.000Z	WoC		k
2012-02-05T12:26:00.000Z	Chotaz		my ideia is to delete every subdirectory from B that already exists in A
2012-02-05T12:27:00.000Z	WoC	Chotaz	quick and dirty would be to just move all the dirs in B to A, overwriting any duplicates; leaving you with just one version lest ofc the dir structure is different
2012-02-05T12:28:00.000Z	WoC		and ofc assuming you have the free space for it
2012-02-05T12:28:00.000Z	Chotaz	WoC	I dont want to lose this structure and I'm not sure if I have the space even
2012-02-05T12:30:00.000Z	Chotaz		he just copied all the dirs from A to B, leaving me with a bunch of duplicates
2012-02-05T12:30:00.000Z	Chotaz		I thought that'd be an easy, script-way out
2012-02-05T12:31:00.000Z	WoC		Chotaz; i think a script may be tricky if the dir structure is completely different
2012-02-05T12:32:00.000Z	Chotaz		 /media/MyBook/Music/GenreA/Flac vs /media/MyBook/GenreB/Flac
2012-02-05T12:32:00.000Z	WoC	Chotaz	there is always mc and some elbow grease ;)
