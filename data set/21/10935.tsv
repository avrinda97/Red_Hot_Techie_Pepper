2004-09-27T10:51:00.000Z	clee		xargs is weak. you should use -exec chmod g+s \{\} \;
2004-09-27T10:51:00.000Z	Kamion	clee	er, no, why?
2004-09-27T10:51:00.000Z	clee	Kamion	because xargs won't work right if any of your directory names have spaces.
2004-09-27T10:51:00.000Z	Kamion	clee	'find /home/bryan -type d -print0 | xargs -0 chmod g+s', then
2004-10-08T15:52:00.000Z	clee	Kamion	heh.
2004-12-18T10:00:00.000Z	clee	Kamion	um, the Ubuntu port is called 'amd64'
2004-12-18T10:00:00.000Z	clee	Kamion	Red Hat calls it x86_64
2004-12-18T10:00:00.000Z	Kamion	clee	uh-huh, but at a kernel/toolchain level it's still x86_64
2004-12-18T10:01:00.000Z	Kamion	clee	we don't munge the toolchain at that kind of level
2004-12-18T10:01:00.000Z	clee	Kamion	right. but we don't define any AMD64 stuff.
2004-12-18T10:01:00.000Z	Kamion	clee	so why did you ask about __AMD64__ and AMD64? I assumed you asked that because RH had them!
2004-12-18T10:01:00.000Z	clee	Kamion	No, I'm asking it because the fd.o xserver uses them and I had to add a check for __x86_64__ instead, and you guys call it AMD64, and not x86_65
2004-12-18T10:02:00.000Z	Kamion	clee	no, we call the dpkg-level architecture amd64
2004-12-18T10:02:00.000Z	Kamion	clee	dpkg architecture != kernel/toolchain architecture
2004-12-18T10:02:00.000Z	clee	Kamion	ok, then.
2004-12-18T10:03:00.000Z	Kamion	clee	so, there's both
2004-12-18T10:03:00.000Z	Kamion	clee	but that must be an upstream gcc thing
2004-12-18T10:03:00.000Z	clee	Kamion	aha. so the source is using caps, that'd be why.
2004-12-18T10:04:00.000Z	Kamion	clee	cool
2004-12-18T10:04:00.000Z	clee	Kamion	thanks for the help :)
2004-12-18T10:05:00.000Z	Kamion	clee	np, sorry for the earlier confusion
