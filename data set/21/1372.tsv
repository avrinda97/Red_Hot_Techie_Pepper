2010-10-10T09:13:00.000Z	blakkheim	TomTom435	fdisk -l
2010-10-10T09:13:00.000Z	blakkheim	TomTom435	then mount the device
2010-10-10T09:14:00.000Z	TomTom435	blakkheim	it doesnt so anything except /dev/sda*, shouldnt there be /dev/sdb* ?
2010-10-10T09:14:00.000Z	blakkheim	TomTom435	yeah there should
2010-10-10T09:15:00.000Z	TomTom435	blakkheim	its one of those server where it has drive slots, I just got a new one from the company and plugged it in and rebooted
2010-10-10T09:15:00.000Z	blakkheim	TomTom435	are you sure they're hotswappable?
2010-10-10T09:16:00.000Z	blakkheim	TomTom435	i would try putting it in a different slot first, if that doesn't work then try the drive in another machine to see if it's detected there
2010-10-10T09:16:00.000Z	TomTom435	blakkheim	its dell 2900 edge server
2010-10-10T09:19:00.000Z	TomTom435	blakkheim	ok gonna try that
2010-10-10T09:19:00.000Z	blakkheim	TomTom435	it could be a sata port on the server, a cable or the actual drive
2010-10-10T09:34:00.000Z	TomTom435	blakkheim	they are hot swappable http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?sku=341-5895&cs=04&c=us&l=en&dgc=SS&cid=27722&lid=628335
2010-10-10T09:34:00.000Z	blakkheim	TomTom435	that is good
2010-10-10T09:35:00.000Z	TomTom435	blakkheim	I tried changing slots, no improve
2010-10-10T09:35:00.000Z	blakkheim	TomTom435	does the drive work in another computer?
2010-10-10T09:35:00.000Z	TomTom435	blakkheim	I dont have any other machines
2010-10-10T09:35:00.000Z	blakkheim	TomTom435	it's possible the drive itself is bad, so
2010-10-10T09:36:00.000Z	TomTom435	blakkheim	should ubuntu detect it without going to BIOS ?
2010-10-10T09:36:00.000Z	blakkheim	TomTom435	yes
2010-10-10T09:37:00.000Z	TomTom435	blakkheim	o god, thats scary, the other 4 drives work as a single drive they are each 250gb
