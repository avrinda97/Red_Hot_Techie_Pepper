2007-04-20T14:25:00.000Z	cedricshock		Does ubuntu 7.04 have badmem or badram already in the kernel? Can I use it when booting the live cd?
2007-04-20T14:25:00.000Z	LjL	cedricshock	uhm, i don't think so
2007-04-20T14:29:00.000Z	LjL	cedricshock	the live CD should definitely work with 224 MB of memory. (what do memory sticks have to do with it?)
2007-04-20T14:30:00.000Z	LjL	cedricshock	ah you mean RAM stick, i was thinking USB stick sorry, i'm stoned
2007-04-20T14:30:00.000Z	cedricshock	LjL	They let me have more memory. It certainly doesn't work with 224.
2007-04-20T14:30:00.000Z	LjL	cedricshock	but anyway, the CD can run with 192MB in my experience
2007-04-20T14:31:00.000Z	cedricshock	LjL	Yeah, that's the quoted number. With 224 it thrashes the CD loading nautilus, and never advances (never being more than a couple hours).
2007-04-20T14:32:00.000Z	LjL	cedricshock	are you sure it's not a problem of corrupted CD (or picky drive) rather than RAM? i'm not just quoting official figures, i *have* run the (edgy) CD on 192 megs
2007-04-20T14:33:00.000Z	cedricshock	LjL	Already checked the CD, and the drive is one of the few things in that computer that isn't a pos. Maybe feisty jumped the memory usage.
2007-04-20T14:35:00.000Z	cedricshock	LjL	I'm sure it'd run with some swap space, but that's not an option. Hmm, I might need to tryu some other live CD for the data recovery part of this. I tried knoppix, but it didn't like my firewire drive (ubuntu likes it just fine).
2007-04-20T14:36:00.000Z	LjL	cedricshock	there are live CDs around that are made specifically for data recovery purposes... not that i have names in my mind right now but
2007-04-20T14:43:00.000Z	cedricshock	LjL	If I boot the alternate install CD, can I get a nice fluffy console?
2007-04-20T14:43:00.000Z	LjL	cedricshock	console, yes, nice and fluffy, i wouldn't say so - most commands are missing
2007-04-20T14:43:00.000Z	LjL	cedricshock	you can always boot the *live* cd in single user console mode, though! can't you?
2007-04-20T14:44:00.000Z	cedricshock	LjL	How do I do that?
2007-04-20T14:45:00.000Z	LjL	cedricshock	i think you can probably just add "single" to the kernel options, though it's not like i've tried
2007-04-20T14:47:00.000Z	cedricshock	LjL	Thanks, it's not in that help. I'll go look it up and tell you what I find. Thanks for your help.
2007-04-20T14:48:00.000Z	LjL	cedricshock	it doesn't mention that option specifically but it tells you how to enter the boot options editor (f6 whatever). just try adding "single" there. not sure it will work - it works on installations, but the live cd is different - but worth trying i suppose
2007-04-20T14:48:00.000Z	cedricshock	LjL	will do
2007-04-20T15:04:00.000Z	cedricshock	LjL	thanks, tossing single in the command line worked.
