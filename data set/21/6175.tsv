2007-05-20T12:20:00.000Z	livingtm	keypad	 you need to get that module loaded by either: A) Modprobing, or B) rebooting
2007-05-20T12:21:00.000Z	livingtm	keypad	If your a good little Linux user, you modprobe ;-)
2007-05-20T12:25:00.000Z	livingtm	keypad	welp, try rebooting :-)
2007-05-20T12:39:00.000Z	livingtm	keypad	well you have two choices... google for the bttv driver source and compile and install, or reinstall ubuntu again. If your ubuntu install is new anyhow, that might just be faster.. althoguh you "wont learn as much"
2007-05-20T12:40:00.000Z	keypad	livingtm	when I installed the kernal again why did it say something about grub ?
2007-05-20T12:40:00.000Z	livingtm	keypad	grub needs to know where the new kernel is in order to load it on boot
2007-05-20T12:41:00.000Z	keypad	livingtm	so theres no chance it kept the old one and booted the old one but added the new one on the list ?
2007-05-20T12:41:00.000Z	livingtm	keypad	well you were really just re-installing the same kernel, but youcan verify with uname -r

2007-05-20T12:42:00.000Z	keypad	livingtm	I mean http://tldp.org/HOWTO/BTTV/hw.html
2007-05-20T12:48:00.000Z	keypad	livingtm	so how do I compile this bt module ?
2007-05-20T12:48:00.000Z	keypad	livingtm	so how do I compile this bttv module ?
2007-05-20T12:51:00.000Z	livingtm	keypad	well, you'd actually be better off using the module in the kernel package...
2007-05-20T12:52:00.000Z	keypad	livingtm	I think this is the command that killed rmmod bttv
2007-05-20T12:57:00.000Z	livingtm	keypad	not really sure why the reinstall didnt replace the modules with a fresh copy
2007-05-20T12:57:00.000Z	keypad	livingtm	if I can remove the module with rmmod bttv there should be a easy way to reinstall it.
2007-05-20T12:58:00.000Z	livingtm	keypad	its part of the kernel-modules package
2007-05-20T12:58:00.000Z	keypad	livingtm	should I see if I can use the recovery ubuntu kernal option ?
2007-05-20T13:00:00.000Z	livingtm	keypad	you can try booting to that, then doing the reinstall of the kernel modules package again
2007-05-20T13:02:00.000Z	keypad	livingtm	whats the command to reinstall the kernel again ?
2007-05-20T13:03:00.000Z	livingtm	keypad	sudo apt-get install --reinstall linux-image-2.6.20-15-generic
