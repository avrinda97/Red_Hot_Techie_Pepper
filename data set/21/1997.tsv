2011-07-23T18:36:00.000Z	edbian	semitones_	Are your hdds filled?  That is a strange error for grub
2011-07-23T18:37:00.000Z	semitones_	edbian	I just installed on a new system. Old pentium 3, huge new hard disk
2011-07-23T18:37:00.000Z	edbian	semitones_	That is strange.  Perhaps it has to do with the Bios large hdd option?
2011-07-23T18:37:00.000Z	semitones_	edbian	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1331730&page=3, one person fixed it by making a /boot partition
2011-07-23T18:38:00.000Z	edbian	semitones_	Can you boot a live CD and look at gparted?  It says in post #25 your harddrive was not partitioned correctly
2011-07-23T18:39:00.000Z	semitones_	edbian	sure I can do that, but I never posted on that thread
2011-07-23T18:39:00.000Z	edbian	semitones_	I know. someone who had the same problem said that happened to him
2011-07-23T18:40:00.000Z	semitones_	edbian	ok, live cd takes about 5-10 minutes to boot up, hold on
2011-07-23T18:40:00.000Z	edbian	semitones_	ugh :(
2011-07-23T18:40:00.000Z	semitones_	edbian	usb is faster, but I lent mine all out to other people :P
2011-07-23T18:51:00.000Z	semitones_	edbian	ok i'm in gparted, everything looks normal to me
2011-07-23T18:52:00.000Z	edbian	semitones_	Ummm, what is your error again? :P

2011-07-23T19:47:00.000Z	edbian	semitones_	Every logical partition must be inside an extended partition.  They can all be in the same one.
2011-07-23T19:49:00.000Z	edbian	semitones_	alright
2011-07-23T19:50:00.000Z	semitones_	edbian	i just wanted to make sure that its ok to have / /home and swap all inside an extended partition
2011-07-23T19:50:00.000Z	edbian	semitones_	That is totally fine
2011-07-23T19:50:00.000Z	edbian	semitones_	I don't think it has too but I guess it's a bit safer
