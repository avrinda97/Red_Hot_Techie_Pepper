2008-08-17T01:45:00.000Z	Agent_bob	CostaRicanQuaker	it may have to do with the /dev/cdrom symlink     you can check to see if it's pointed at the correct device
2008-08-17T01:47:00.000Z	Agent_bob	CostaRicanQuaker	heh  one work around calls for another though... ;/
2008-08-17T03:22:00.000Z	Agent_bob	CostaRicanQuaker	libc6
2008-09-27T23:24:00.000Z	Agent_bob	CostaRicanQuaker	killall name
2008-09-27T23:25:00.000Z	Agent_bob	CostaRicanQuaker	killall is cleaner than kill  but both work    so does fuse  but i'll keep it simple for you.    killall name_of_app
2008-09-27T23:26:00.000Z	CostaRicanQuaker	Agent_bob	didn't work
2008-09-27T23:26:00.000Z	Agent_bob	CostaRicanQuaker	sudo it
2008-09-27T23:27:00.000Z	Agent_bob	CostaRicanQuaker	yes  you have to supply a process id for kill to work  and a name for killall  they are different apps
2008-09-27T23:27:00.000Z	Agent_bob	CostaRicanQuaker	heh   pidof pidgen
2008-09-27T23:28:00.000Z	CostaRicanQuaker	Agent_bob	nothinghappened...it just says "killing"
2008-09-27T23:30:00.000Z	Agent_bob	CostaRicanQuaker	are you telling me that   "sudo killall pidgen"    doesn't kill pidgen ?      and check the name i don't use it myself.
2008-09-27T23:32:00.000Z	CostaRicanQuaker	Agent_bob	yeah, the program's not responding...it says killing as it has been for ten min now
2008-09-27T23:32:00.000Z	Agent_bob	CostaRicanQuaker	add -9  to the command
2008-09-27T23:32:00.000Z	CostaRicanQuaker	Agent_bob	how? more like where
2008-09-27T23:33:00.000Z	Agent_bob	CostaRicanQuaker	sudo killall -9 pidgen
2008-09-27T23:33:00.000Z	Agent_bob	CostaRicanQuaker	we call that "using a bigger hammer"
2008-09-27T23:33:00.000Z	Agent_bob	CostaRicanQuaker	as in don't force it, just use a bigger hammer
2008-09-27T23:34:00.000Z	CostaRicanQuaker	Agent_bob	still there on the list of apps from the system monitor and the window titlebar stillr eads killing
2008-09-27T23:35:00.000Z	Agent_bob	CostaRicanQuaker	-15
2008-09-27T23:39:00.000Z	Agent_bob	CostaRicanQuaker	you can also use    pstree     and see if it has something started that it can't kill and kill that something. (same way)    although that shouldn't be needed, and seldom is.
