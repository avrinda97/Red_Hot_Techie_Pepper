2008-10-31T02:37:00.000Z	jrib	tilde	no.  runlevels 2-5 are identical by default.  Why do you need to do that?
2008-10-31T02:37:00.000Z	tilde	jrib	just wondering, so runlevels 2 then runlevels 5?

2008-10-31T03:28:00.000Z	jrib	tilde	best to just ask the channel your question.  If someone knows the answer, they will try to answer you
