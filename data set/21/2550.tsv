2009-09-23T04:29:00.000Z	Casandrax		ssh -XC -l UserName HostName
2009-09-23T04:30:00.000Z	Casandrax		got it shane2peru ?
2009-09-23T04:30:00.000Z	shane2peru	Casandrax	I think it is ssh -X
2009-09-23T04:31:00.000Z	Casandrax	shane2peru	C means use client libs, incase the servers have none
2009-09-23T04:31:00.000Z	Casandrax	shane2peru	C is faster if you have them
2009-09-23T04:31:00.000Z	shane2peru	Casandrax	how do I set that?  on the client install what?
2009-09-23T04:31:00.000Z	Casandrax	shane2peru	And you most likely do, right ?
2009-09-23T04:32:00.000Z	shane2peru	Casandrax	now sure I follow you.
2009-09-23T04:32:00.000Z	Casandrax	shane2peru	terminal window ?
2009-09-23T04:32:00.000Z	shane2peru	Casandrax	yes, I have terminal. :)
2009-09-23T04:32:00.000Z	Casandrax		GO GO GO!!! :)
2009-09-23T04:32:00.000Z	shane2peru	Casandrax	usually that is the way I log in, but some times I need gui on occasion
2009-09-23T04:33:00.000Z	Casandrax	shane2peru	guis rule, if they rule, which they do, when they rule
2009-09-23T04:33:00.000Z	shane2peru	Casandrax	so ssh is all setup, but sometimes I need gui, then -X is the way to go right?  What is the -C thing?
2009-09-23T04:34:00.000Z	shane2peru	Casandrax	it is for my kids computer, I have them setup with timekpr (awesome time keeper for Ubuntu) but it is messing up, and I have to use gui for that.
2009-09-23T04:35:00.000Z	shane2peru	Casandrax	brb, gotta run down and fix their ip setup to static
2009-09-23T04:41:00.000Z	Casandrax	shane2peru	Im using my girlfriends windows computer. If it blinks or the symanticcs antivirsyth tells me i may be at risk again ill throw this thing out the window /hehe (A true horrorbox)
2009-09-23T04:42:00.000Z	shane2peru	Casandrax	just tell her it had a virus and you fixed it, (install Ubuntu) :)
2009-09-23T04:46:00.000Z	Casandrax	shane2peru	Yeah, i really really want to because it makes me so inneficient (Trapped behind evil) /Semi Metallica etc, heh. The cumputer is a "HP pavillion Entertainment pc". The shift buttons/etc have been cut into half size so you cant type very fast
2009-09-23T04:46:00.000Z	Casandrax	shane2peru	But i can obviously turn the laptop screen all around... whenever i would possibly wanna do that :)
