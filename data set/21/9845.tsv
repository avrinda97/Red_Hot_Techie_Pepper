2005-07-26T07:57:00.000Z	teferi		and like i said, everything understands 'em
2005-07-26T07:57:00.000Z	teferi		even cellphones
2005-07-26T07:58:00.000Z	teferi		ldif isn't particularly awful, if you're using ldap
2005-07-26T07:58:00.000Z	teferi		um, if you're using ldap, you really shouldn't be using anything else, actually...
2005-07-26T07:58:00.000Z	teferi		and fuck, i'd rather have some xml format than vcard
2005-07-26T07:58:00.000Z	teferi		vcard is arcane
2005-07-26T07:58:00.000Z	teferi		don't look at me
2005-07-26T07:58:00.000Z	teferi		i rolled out our ldap setup at my college
2005-07-26T07:58:00.000Z	teferi		:P
2005-07-26T07:59:00.000Z	teferi		also because it's still the best way around of doing single-sign-on
2005-07-26T08:00:00.000Z	robertj	teferi	OS X has single-sign-on more or less whipped, I hope Ubuntu catches up
2005-07-26T08:00:00.000Z	teferi	robertj	er, i mean in a network environment
2005-07-26T08:00:00.000Z	robertj	teferi	yes...
2005-07-26T08:01:00.000Z	robertj	teferi	ldap + krb by default with the last 2 versions
2005-07-26T08:03:00.000Z	teferi	robertj	mmm. AFS.
2005-07-26T08:03:00.000Z	teferi	robertj	like i said, if only it wasn't such a SOB to set up on the server end
2005-07-26T08:03:00.000Z	robertj	teferi	AFS as no love from apple, but cifs is good enough for us
2005-07-26T08:05:00.000Z	robertj	teferi	It's cool but it's not got nearly the scope of your every day file server
2005-07-26T08:05:00.000Z	teferi	robertj	not nearly the scope?
2005-07-26T08:06:00.000Z	robertj	teferi	what is, afs?
2005-07-26T08:07:00.000Z	robertj	teferi	I just decided its more trouble than its worth and bought bigger disks ;)
