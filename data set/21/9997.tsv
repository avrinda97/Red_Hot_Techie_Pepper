2005-06-12T09:23:00.000Z	WhiteRabbit		network traffic?
2005-06-12T09:23:00.000Z	dooglus	WhiteRabbit	wouldn't netstat show it up?
2005-06-12T09:23:00.000Z	WhiteRabbit	dooglus	netstat -antup
2005-06-12T09:24:00.000Z	dooglus	WhiteRabbit	that shows 4 lines:  2 for gaim, one for ssh and a 'LISTEN' for ntop
2005-06-12T09:24:00.000Z	WhiteRabbit	dooglus	you are in a ssh session then or someone else to you is
2005-06-12T09:25:00.000Z	dooglus	WhiteRabbit	I'm using ssh to talk to you now
2005-06-12T09:25:00.000Z	dooglus	WhiteRabbit	irssi is running on a remote server
2005-06-12T09:25:00.000Z	WhiteRabbit	dooglus	how many channels are you in
2005-06-12T09:25:00.000Z	dooglus	WhiteRabbit	the download rate of 15 to 20k/s stays the same even if I disconnect the ssh session.
2005-06-12T09:26:00.000Z	WhiteRabbit	dooglus	pissed anyone off today?
2005-06-12T09:26:00.000Z	dooglus	WhiteRabbit	and anyway, the other channels I'm in wouldn't cause network traffic between my and the remote irssi session - only between the remote irssi session and the irc server
2005-06-12T09:26:00.000Z	dooglus	WhiteRabbit	maybe.

2005-10-05T06:50:00.000Z	dooglus	WhiteRabbit	if you were trying to answer Samhain's question of why he can't run applications with that, then it wasn't very helpful.
