2008-01-12T09:51:00.000Z	FernandoL		could someone help me get my sound working on ubuntu?
2008-01-12T09:52:00.000Z	FactTech	FernandoL	What's the symptom you're getting?
2008-01-12T09:52:00.000Z	FernandoL	FactTech	I just don't get any sound coming out of my laptop :(
2008-01-12T09:52:00.000Z	FactTech	FernandoL	Do you know what kind of sound hardware it has?
2008-01-12T09:54:00.000Z	FernandoL	FactTech	I have no idea what my sound card is
2008-01-12T09:55:00.000Z	FactTech	FernandoL	Do you see anything that looks like a sound card when you type 'lspci -v' in a terminal?
2008-01-12T09:56:00.000Z	FernandoL	FactTech	nope
2008-01-12T09:56:00.000Z	FactTech	FernandoL	What model is your laptop?
2008-01-12T09:56:00.000Z	FernandoL	FactTech	i dont know, all I know is that it's gateway. Someone gave it to me.
2008-01-12T09:57:00.000Z	FernandoL	FactTech	I haven't had it for long
2008-01-12T09:57:00.000Z	FactTech	FernandoL	It's a gateway model what?
2008-01-12T09:58:00.000Z	FernandoL	FactTech	well I dont know what modelit is because someone gave it to me.
2008-01-12T09:58:00.000Z	FactTech	FernandoL	Usually there is a label or something on the bottom (for a laptop) that will tell the model number.
2008-01-12T09:59:00.000Z	FernandoL	FactTech	W340UI is the model
2008-01-12T09:59:00.000Z	FactTech	FernandoL	Try looking online to see what the product specs are... it may list the sound hardware.
2008-01-12T10:01:00.000Z	FernandoL	FactTech	okay thanks I'll get back to you on it
2008-01-12T10:01:00.000Z	FactTech	FernandoL	Looks like others have had the same problem... I'm reading.
2008-01-12T10:06:00.000Z	FactTech	FernandoL	No sweat, good luck.
2008-01-12T10:07:00.000Z	FactTech	FernandoL	Not a bother. I've just been going through a bunch of sound stuff myself, so it's good practice. This is the help forum, after all.
2008-01-12T10:07:00.000Z	FernandoL	FactTech	alright. One thing I'd like to know though, how can I make my user root?
2008-01-12T10:08:00.000Z	FactTech	FernandoL	If you're using Ubuntu, you don't want to login as root, you want to activate root abilities using 'sudo' (for terminal apps) or 'gksudo' (for graphical apps).
