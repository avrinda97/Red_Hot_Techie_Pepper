2010-08-22T06:49:00.000Z	Niglop		how do i delete a user?
2010-08-22T06:50:00.000Z	KE1HA	Niglop	 it's best to do though the User Manager: System Administration >> user and Groups
2010-08-22T06:52:00.000Z	KE1HA	Niglop	 do: sudo cat /et/passwd | grep [user_mane]  .. is it listed there?
2010-08-22T06:53:00.000Z	KE1HA	Niglop	 what is the user name you want to delete ?
2010-08-22T06:55:00.000Z	KE1HA	Niglop	 what is that username ?
2010-08-22T06:55:00.000Z	KE1HA	Niglop	  sudo userdel -r kipx   Unless if course that is you :-)
2010-08-22T06:56:00.000Z	KE1HA	Niglop	 su to a diffrent user
2010-08-22T06:58:00.000Z	KE1HA	Niglop	 get all the way out, reboot if you have too, then log in as your sudo user, then userdel -r kipx
2010-08-22T07:12:00.000Z	KE1HA	Niglop	 whar user did you log into the system with after reboot?
2010-08-22T07:12:00.000Z	KE1HA	Niglop	 and your trying to remove kipx ?
2010-08-22T07:13:00.000Z	KE1HA	Niglop	 well, now it interesting.
2010-08-22T07:15:00.000Z	KE1HA	Niglop	 this is very odd, did you create any services ot have anything running with kipx ?
2010-08-22T07:16:00.000Z	KE1HA	Niglop	 Im at a loss on this one im affraid, not seen this behavior before.
2010-08-22T07:17:00.000Z	KE1HA	Niglop	 No Lag / Jittery vids anymore :-) it's cool.
2010-08-22T07:18:00.000Z	KE1HA	Niglop	 IDK, but Im still looking into this user thing, it's very odd.
2010-08-22T07:21:00.000Z	KE1HA	Niglop	 elder fud says Vewy Vewy interesting
2010-08-22T07:22:00.000Z	KE1HA	Niglop	 NBugs Bunny NVM, Im searching fer any reported bugs on this one.
2010-08-22T07:24:00.000Z	KE1HA	Niglop	 hre's the bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/adduser/+bug/239069
2010-08-22T07:24:00.000Z	KE1HA	Niglop	 It seems to have re-appeared. That's an old bug, what version of Ubuntu you using?
2010-08-22T07:26:00.000Z	KE1HA	Niglop	 On the bottom of that bug, add what your seeing, and do what the last user did to show the results.
2010-08-22T07:29:00.000Z	KE1HA	Niglop	 also include on your report the output from : cat /etc/lsb-release
