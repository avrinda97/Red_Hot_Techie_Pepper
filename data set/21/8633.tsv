2006-09-10T06:21:00.000Z	jerware		are there any gcc users in here ?
2006-09-10T06:22:00.000Z	jerware		this is not a C programming idiosycrasy
2006-09-10T06:22:00.000Z	sethk	jerware	sure.  what's the question?
2006-09-10T06:22:00.000Z	sethk	jerware	what link did you create?
2006-09-10T06:23:00.000Z	sethk	jerware	don't do that
2006-09-10T06:23:00.000Z	jerware	sethk	 but apt-get  doesent create the necessary
2006-09-10T06:23:00.000Z	sethk	jerware	you have a mixed up installation now, only part of version 4 is installed, and you stepped on the one that's installed properly
2006-09-10T06:23:00.000Z	sethk	jerware	apt-get isn't supposed to
2006-09-10T06:24:00.000Z	jerware	sethk	 what am i then missing?
2006-09-10T06:24:00.000Z	sethk	jerware	when you have multiple gcc versions, you have to use the installed gcc at the path that it is installed to, so it finds the corresponding headers and libraries
2006-09-10T06:24:00.000Z	sethk	jerware	I install from source, so I'm not sure of the package names, but presumably they will have 4.0 in the name
2006-09-10T06:24:00.000Z	jerware	sethk	 oh am i missing the path to /usr/lib or what ever in $path  ?
2006-09-10T06:25:00.000Z	sethk	jerware	no, unlikely
2006-09-10T06:25:00.000Z	sethk	jerware	not necessarily, no
2006-09-10T06:26:00.000Z	sethk	jerware	but version 4.0 is old and buggy, either uses a later v4, or v3
2006-09-10T06:26:00.000Z	sethk	jerware	4.0 is the first version 4 major release.  4.1 is the second, etc.
2006-09-10T06:27:00.000Z	sethk	jerware	I'm saying don't use 4.0, use the latest which I believe is 4.3 something
2006-09-10T06:28:00.000Z	jerware	sethk	 those versions are not an installation candidate in apt
2006-09-10T06:31:00.000Z	jerware	sethk	 where did you get your man pages for library and system C calls ?
2006-09-10T06:32:00.000Z	sethk	jerware	I'll check the package name for that
2006-09-10T06:33:00.000Z	sethk	jerware	package is:  manpages-posix-dev
