2011-03-08T10:09:00.000Z	Nisstyre	Guest77920	also, libxul, sounds like it should already be installed
2011-03-08T10:09:00.000Z	Nisstyre		since firefox requires xulrunner
2011-03-08T10:10:00.000Z	Guest77920		i know but it is'nt
2011-03-08T10:10:00.000Z	Nisstyre	Guest77920	have you tried sudo apt-get install libxul ?
2011-03-08T10:11:00.000Z	Guest77920		yeah it says unable to locate package libxul
2011-03-08T10:12:00.000Z	Nisstyre	Guest77920	are you using a makefile to compile it?
2011-03-08T10:12:00.000Z	Guest77920		yup
2011-03-08T10:12:00.000Z	Nisstyre	Guest77920	pastebin it

2011-03-08T10:15:00.000Z	Nisstyre		or libxul-common actually
2011-03-08T10:15:00.000Z	Nisstyre		either one will probably work

2011-03-08T10:16:00.000Z	Guest77920		10.10
2011-03-08T10:17:00.000Z	Nisstyre	Guest77920	not sure but I think it might not be available in that version
2011-03-08T10:18:00.000Z	Guest77920		hmm well thanks anyways man
2011-03-08T10:18:00.000Z	Nisstyre	Guest77920	you can always try making libxul from source as well
