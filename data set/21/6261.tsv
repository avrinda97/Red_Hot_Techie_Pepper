2007-10-01T12:44:00.000Z	neverblue2		when I ssh into another box, using the -X flag, when I start up firefox, it runs the local, not the remote, as the bookmarks, history, etc are the same.  Can I use ssh to run firefox on the remote box, locally?
2007-10-01T12:45:00.000Z	usr13	neverblue2	If I understand your question properly, I would say yes
2007-10-01T12:46:00.000Z	neverblue2	usr13	then how would you do it :)
2007-10-01T12:47:00.000Z	usr13		 neverblue2 just issue command firefox
2007-10-01T12:47:00.000Z	neverblue2	usr13	if you re-read what I wrote, you will see that I have attempted that already, but its running with local info, not remote info
2007-10-01T12:48:00.000Z	usr13		 neverblue2 If it's already running, kill it.  and then start it again.
2007-10-01T12:48:00.000Z	usr13	neverblue2	killall firefox
2007-10-01T12:49:00.000Z	neverblue2	usr13	im sure you dont understand my question, but thanks for trying :D
2007-10-01T12:49:00.000Z	usr13	neverblue2	or ps aux |grep firefox     and then   kill ####  (where ### is firefox pid#)
2007-10-01T12:50:00.000Z	usr13	neverblue2	What your saying is that it's comming up on the remote terminal?
2007-10-01T12:50:00.000Z	usr13	neverblue2	..when you issue command via ssh terminal?
2007-10-01T12:51:00.000Z	neverblue2	usr13	no
2007-10-01T12:52:00.000Z	usr13	neverblue2	  WHat are you saying then.  (Do not understand.)
2007-10-01T12:52:00.000Z	neverblue2	usr13	yes, I said, you dont understand my question
2007-10-01T12:53:00.000Z	usr13	neverblue2	Then explain your question.
2007-10-01T12:53:00.000Z	usr13	neverblue2	You are tying to run firefox on a remote machine via ssh.  Right?
2007-10-01T12:53:00.000Z	neverblue2		running the remote profile on the remote firefox, rather than the local profile, when it opens
2007-10-01T12:54:00.000Z	usr13	neverblue2	Now, do you want the firefox window to come up on your monitor, or the remote monitor?
2007-10-01T12:54:00.000Z	usr13	neverblue2	It will run the profile on the remote computer.
2007-10-01T12:55:00.000Z	neverblue2	usr13	im not sure you have ever tried, but believe what you 'think' is true :)
2007-10-01T12:55:00.000Z	usr13	neverblue2	and the only way I know to change that is to upload your profile to that remote computer.
