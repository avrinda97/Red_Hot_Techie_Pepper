2008-05-19T00:08:00.000Z	commodore13		I didn't think that it did.
2008-05-19T00:09:00.000Z	commodore13		also I wanted to truecrypt my drive and its much simpler with wubi than using grub.
2008-05-19T00:11:00.000Z	commodore13		I'm using an emergency live cd right now, and I have no idea how to fix my MBR.......
2008-05-19T00:12:00.000Z	commodore13		Will somebody help me in a private chat? or I can give out my email...
2008-05-19T00:12:00.000Z	commodore13		i know... bad idea, but I'm desperate.
2008-05-19T00:13:00.000Z	hischild	commodore13	what's the problem then?
2008-05-19T00:14:00.000Z	commodore13	hischild	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=798826
2008-05-19T00:15:00.000Z	hischild	commodore13	it's better practice to describe the problem instead of redirecting to a thread.
2008-05-19T00:15:00.000Z	hischild	commodore13	you've erased the mbr of windows...
2008-05-19T00:16:00.000Z	commodore13		yes
2008-05-19T00:16:00.000Z	hischild	commodore13	get an xp cd, go to recovery mode, type fixmbr, and you should be done.
2008-05-19T00:16:00.000Z	commodore13	hischild	I don't have my XP CD and I'm running vista premium
2008-05-19T00:16:00.000Z	hischild	commodore13	then create a small /boot partition and install grub on that. Or use the supergrub disc to fix it.
2008-05-19T00:17:00.000Z	commodore13	hischild	my problem is a bit more complicated then that, will you open a private chat with me please?
2008-05-19T00:18:00.000Z	hischild	commodore13	i will not. I'm willing to help in the channel though.
2008-05-19T00:18:00.000Z	commodore13		all right, well to make It short I dont want GRUB because its a pain to truecrypt using grub
2008-05-19T00:19:00.000Z	hischild	commodore13	you can use the supergrub disc to fix the mbr like windows would with fixmbr. Google for the supergrub disc, boot from it, then follow the onscreen instructions.
2008-05-19T00:19:00.000Z	hischild	commodore13	that means that you won't have grub.
2008-05-19T00:19:00.000Z	commodore13	hischild	will that install the originall vista bootloader?
2008-05-19T00:20:00.000Z	hischild	commodore13	it will fix the mbr. The bootloader from vista hasn't been removed, only the link to it. supergrub will put that back.
2008-05-19T00:20:00.000Z	commodore13	hischild	I will try that, thank you.
