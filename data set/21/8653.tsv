2006-03-01T09:23:00.000Z	Zoroaster		I upgraded my kernel, wher can I find info on how to recompile my kernel, like a how to for dummies
2006-03-01T09:23:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	Zoroaster	why would you want to recompile your kernel?
2006-03-01T09:24:00.000Z	Zoroaster	hatake_kakashi	because I can't get vmware to work, I get the message -
2006-03-01T09:25:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	Zoroaster	hmm
2006-03-01T09:25:00.000Z	Zoroaster	hatake_kakashi	It gives me 2 solutions, shouldn't I recompile my kernel
2006-03-01T09:26:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	Zoroaster	well you could do that however some things may break, umm as for kernel compiling, I'm not too sure, I learned it mostly by trail and error and wouldn't say that I would be good enough to advice on kernel recompiling. However its a long and has to be well thought out process
2006-03-01T09:27:00.000Z	Zoroaster	hatake_kakashi	would you then say that I shoul reinstall Ubuntu
2006-03-01T09:27:00.000Z	Zoroaster	hatake_kakashi	and not upghrade my kernel next time?
2006-03-01T09:27:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	Zoroaster	that wouldn't help.. I can see where your problem exist, and that only leaves kernel recompiling if you really wanted to get vmware to work
2006-03-01T09:28:00.000Z	Zoroaster	hatake_kakashi	what caused my problem is upgrading my kernel, should I just stick with the kernel version that breezy comes with?
2006-03-01T09:29:00.000Z	Zoroaster	hatake_kakashi	why do I need to be upgrading my kernel, if all it did was break vmware?
2006-03-01T09:30:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	Zoroaster	afaik, its not upgrading that breaks it, in fact I think standard ubuntu modded linux kernel is compiled through gcc3.4.5 but when you get the latest linux-source off the ubuntu's archive, it tries to recommend you to get gcc3.4 instead of gcc4.0
2006-03-01T09:35:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	Zoroaster	I don't think even getting gcc3.4 will work.. what I suggest is that if you want to rebuild the kernel and all, it could be quite a hectic process
2006-03-01T09:38:00.000Z	Zoroaster	hatake_kakashi	I am downloading GCC 3.4.5 right now
2006-03-01T09:39:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	Zoroaster	ok, good luck :)
2006-03-01T09:39:00.000Z	Zoroaster	hatake_kakashi	but I have one last question
2006-03-01T09:40:00.000Z	Zoroaster	hatake_kakashi	before I upgraded the kernel, VMware worked, so If I do a fresh install of Ubuntu should I avoid the latest kernel?
2006-03-01T09:41:00.000Z	Zoroaster	hatake_kakashi	or is getting the latest kernel neccessary?
2006-03-01T09:41:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	Zoroaster	hmm odd
2006-03-01T09:41:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	Zoroaster	well having the latest ubuntu modded kernel I suppose would be beneficial in some ways. Not always will you get 100% more benefits, your mileage may vary
2006-03-01T10:37:00.000Z	Zoroaster	hatake_kakashi	thanks for your help earlier too
