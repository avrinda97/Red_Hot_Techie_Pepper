2007-02-12T12:38:00.000Z	chris_	norty	cp -R fo fol fold /home/chris/folder/
2007-02-12T12:38:00.000Z	norty	chris_	what does that do
2007-02-12T12:38:00.000Z	chris_	norty	copies directory "fo" "fol" "fold" to /home/chris/folder
2007-02-12T12:39:00.000Z	chris_	norty	just an example of what you were asking to do
2007-02-12T12:39:00.000Z	chris_	norty	yes
2007-02-12T12:40:00.000Z	norty	chris_	do I have to give the paths of each of the folders?
2007-02-12T12:41:00.000Z	chris_	norty	if they are each in a different location
2007-02-12T12:41:00.000Z	norty	chris_	so it would be like "/home/norty/Desktop/fol" "/home/norty/Desktop/fold" ..etc ?
2007-02-12T12:42:00.000Z	chris_	norty	try an play with it a bit, you'll get the grasp of it.. cp will not remove anything so if you get multiple copies of something somehow you can later remove them
2007-02-12T12:42:00.000Z	chris_	norty	should be that easy
2007-02-12T12:44:00.000Z	chris_	norty	if your not sure norty, I would suggest making a few test folders an toying with it to verify your doing what you want it to do first, # mkdir testfolder  .. etc.
2007-02-12T13:01:00.000Z	norty	chris_	is it the same command to copy multiply files instead of directories?
2007-02-12T13:01:00.000Z	chris_	norty	yes, you dont have to use the -R
2007-02-12T13:04:00.000Z	chris_	norty	have you tried using autocomplete, pressing "tab" after you partially spell the name.
2007-02-12T13:05:00.000Z	chris_	norty	how did you get the strange character in the name?
2007-02-12T13:05:00.000Z	chris_	norty	is it a windows drive?
2007-02-12T13:05:00.000Z	chris_	norty	its disconnected from windows?
2007-02-12T13:06:00.000Z	chris_	norty	is it a special like an I with dots or something like this "~"
2007-02-12T13:10:00.000Z	chris_	norty	how many special characters are in the filename, all, an does it begin with a special character?
2007-02-12T13:11:00.000Z	chris_	norty	exactly what fiber said
2007-02-12T13:12:00.000Z	chris_	norty	yeah
