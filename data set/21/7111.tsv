2007-02-15T08:11:00.000Z	Vande8594		what distro of ubuntu is recomended for an old win. 98 box? will edgy work or is there a better version?
2007-02-15T08:12:00.000Z	Sanne	Vande8594	depends on the hardware. Maybe choose a smaller desktop like xfce (xubuntu) rather than gnome (ubuntu) or kde (kubuntu)
2007-02-15T08:13:00.000Z	Vande8594	Sanne	its all older hardware. so is xubuntu lighter?
2007-02-15T08:13:00.000Z	Sanne	Vande8594	yes, definitely. I used it on an athlon thunderbird 1 ghz box and it was fine. What processor is that on your box?
2007-02-15T08:14:00.000Z	Vande8594	Sanne	umm not sure havent turned it on in awhile its around 800 or so mHz, all i want to do is type and surf web on it
2007-02-15T08:14:00.000Z	Vande8594	Sanne	maby some music playing
2007-02-15T08:15:00.000Z	Sanne	Vande8594	I would test with xubuntu. You could try the live cd to see if it picks up all hardware, but keep in mind that ir will be faster when actually installed. There are also still lighter desktops/window managers like fluxbox, openbox etc, but you will trade speed for convenience then.
2007-02-15T08:16:00.000Z	Vande8594	Sanne	ok awsome ill jot those down, ill prolly start then with live scence i dont have a harddrive installed yet
2007-02-15T08:17:00.000Z	Sanne	Vande8594	what I don't know to recommend is if you should use edgy, or play safe and use dapper (last one before edgy with long time support - more stable)
2007-02-15T08:17:00.000Z	Vande8594	Sanne	ok good idea
2007-02-15T08:18:00.000Z	Sanne	Vande8594	maybe try edgy first, if it works, you'll have more recent software.
2007-02-15T08:18:00.000Z	Vande8594	Sanne	: k ill just burn both, i got like 5 computers sitting here so i can try a version on each
2007-02-15T08:19:00.000Z	Sanne	Vande8594	cool, good luck then, have fun :)
2007-02-15T08:19:00.000Z	Vande8594	Sanne	:: thanks man i hope this all works
2007-02-15T08:20:00.000Z	Vande8594	Sanne	thanks women*
2007-02-15T08:20:00.000Z	Sanne	Vande8594	hehe, you're welcome :)
2007-02-15T08:21:00.000Z	Sanne	Vande8594	I bet there *are* mirrors in the us
2007-02-15T08:21:00.000Z	Vande8594	Sanne	well registered mirrors
2007-02-15T08:22:00.000Z	Sanne	Vande8594	ah... and I forgot, it's xubuntu, maybe different, because it's manily a community project (should have mentioned that).
2007-02-15T08:23:00.000Z	Vande8594	Sanne	:: ok thanks
2007-02-15T08:23:00.000Z	Sanne	Vande8594	:)
