2006-04-07T12:16:00.000Z	michael		teach me to program in ubuntu, please, preferably in C++, or is it g++. Are they the same thing.
2006-04-07T12:16:00.000Z	michael		I just need a pointer in the right direction
2006-04-07T12:17:00.000Z	slavik	michael	g++ is a compiler
2006-04-07T12:18:00.000Z	michael	slavik	does g++ compile c++?
2006-04-07T12:18:00.000Z	slavik	michael	yes it does :)
2006-04-07T12:18:00.000Z	slavik	michael	teaching C++ cannot be done in 5min... even the simplest thing
2006-04-07T12:19:00.000Z	slavik	michael	it's the same ;)
2006-04-07T12:19:00.000Z	michael	slavik	but i don't know where to get started... do I make the file and then use g++ to compile it, because i'm used to a GUI
2006-04-07T12:20:00.000Z	slavik	michael	do "sudo apt-get install anjuta"
2006-04-07T12:20:00.000Z	slavik	michael	msg me ... so we don't flood
2006-04-07T12:26:00.000Z	slavik	michael	you still want to learn to code?
2006-04-07T12:29:00.000Z	michael	slavik	when I make a program using c++, i can compile the code to suite windows or red hat as well, can't i?
2006-04-07T12:29:00.000Z	slavik	michael	how complex is your code?
2006-04-07T12:29:00.000Z	slavik	michael	if it is something for a class then most likely
2006-04-07T12:30:00.000Z	slavik	michael	anything in the standard template library should be a simple copy/paste affair
2006-04-07T12:31:00.000Z	michael	slavik	thanks
2006-04-07T12:31:00.000Z	slavik	michael	np
2006-04-07T12:35:00.000Z	michael	slavik	will the header files I need already be in the right place? for using cin and cout
2006-04-07T12:42:00.000Z	slavik	michael	printf is in C not C++ :)
2006-04-07T12:42:00.000Z	slavik	michael	pm me if you want to talk about code... don't want to flood this channel :)
2006-04-07T12:42:00.000Z	michael	slavik	how do i start a pm in XChat?
