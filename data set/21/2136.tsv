2012-02-20T08:03:00.000Z	rattatoue	Uncle_Fester	http://wiki.winehq.org/FAQ#head-9893ae50079ca7a959258f0bc9a17aaf2e69b391 go there and go to 4.2 It says how to uninstall a program in wine.
2012-02-20T08:03:00.000Z	rattatoue	Uncle_Fester	and did you try it?
2012-02-20T08:04:00.000Z	rattatoue	Uncle_Fester	in a terminal run wine uninstaller
2012-02-20T08:04:00.000Z	rattatoue	Uncle_Fester	oh strange. Hmm.
2012-02-20T08:06:00.000Z	rattatoue	Uncle_Fester	sounds like you might need to reinstall your wine
2012-02-20T08:28:00.000Z	rattatoue	Uncle_Fester	upper right corner? The little gear looking icon.
2012-02-20T08:28:00.000Z	rattatoue	Uncle_Fester	are you on unity? like where you have a dock looking thing on the left of your screen
2012-02-20T08:29:00.000Z	rattatoue	Uncle_Fester	but there are different DE. Do you see icons on the left side of your screen? looks kinda like  a dock with firefox icon and a few others.
2012-02-20T08:30:00.000Z	rattatoue	Uncle_Fester	then you should have a gear icon in the top right.
2012-02-20T08:31:00.000Z	rattatoue	Uncle_Fester	do you see in the top right where your TIME is, then next to it shows whatever your username is, then next to that is a Gear\star\circle looking icon?
2012-02-20T08:31:00.000Z	rattatoue	Uncle_Fester	are you at the login screen?
2012-02-20T08:32:00.000Z	rattatoue	Uncle_Fester	are you on the login screen ? otherwise you should have the gear thing
2012-02-20T08:33:00.000Z	rattatoue	Uncle_Fester	no idea sorry Fester. It should be there, its always been there for me on 11.10.
