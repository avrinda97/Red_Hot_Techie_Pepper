2011-01-28T07:24:00.000Z	jrib	rtdos	pastebin the contents of /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts
2011-01-28T07:30:00.000Z	rtdos	jrib	i can't really use pastbin to paste the contents of the files as i have not internet access on the affected machine: hostname is "UB810" and the first to lines of hosts is "127.0.0.1 localhost" & "127.0.1.1 UB810" the remaining lines in hosts are the default for ipv6.
2011-01-28T07:31:00.000Z	rtdos	jrib	my modem / router is 192.168.1.1
2011-01-28T07:31:00.000Z	jrib	rtdos	and « hostname » returns UB810?
2011-01-28T07:31:00.000Z	rtdos	jrib	ifconfig says i am connected to the network (even gives me an ip address) but i cannot use my browser or browse the network.
2011-01-28T07:32:00.000Z	jrib	rtdos	what does it actually say instead of "<hostname>" in what you pasted?
2011-01-28T07:32:00.000Z	jrib	rtdos	wait, isn't this the sudo error question?
2011-01-28T07:35:00.000Z	jrib	rtdos	well can you ping an ip in the outside world?
2011-01-28T07:35:00.000Z	rtdos	jrib	typing hostname also returns "UB810"
2011-01-28T07:37:00.000Z	rtdos	jrib	i get an operation not permitted error when i try and ping anything in the outside world.
2011-01-28T07:37:00.000Z	jrib	rtdos	what does it say exactly?  What did you run exactly?
2011-02-01T21:31:00.000Z	jrib	rtdos	what is "the line mode browser"?

2011-02-07T03:03:00.000Z	jrib	rtdos	most people setup a ~/.xinitrc
2011-02-07T03:03:00.000Z	rtdos	jrib	that file is not in my home directory. where do i copy it from?
2011-02-07T03:03:00.000Z	jrib	rtdos	you just create it
2011-02-07T03:05:00.000Z	rtdos	jrib	from scratch? don't i need to put in defaults?
2011-02-07T03:06:00.000Z	jrib	rtdos	defaults of what?  A basic one is just "#!/bin/sh; startfluxbox"
2011-02-07T03:07:00.000Z	jrib	rtdos	here: http://fluxbox-wiki.org/index.php?title=.xinitrc
