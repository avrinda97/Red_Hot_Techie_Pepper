2008-01-19T19:54:00.000Z	stib	stefg	err.. apart from the bot
2008-01-19T19:54:00.000Z	stefg	stib	the docu the bot mentions :-)
2008-01-19T19:55:00.000Z	stib	stefg	read it, still don't know what's going wrong
2008-01-19T19:56:00.000Z	stefg	stib	'doesn't work' and 'anyone' questions usually don't yield results. so decribe what you try to do, what you did to achieve it, and how that is not what you expected
2008-01-19T19:57:00.000Z	stib	stefg	I've been patiently doing that for about half an hour
2008-01-19T19:57:00.000Z	stefg	stib	so this is a hint to improve your asking skills :-)
2008-01-19T19:58:00.000Z	stib	stefg	umm.. I'm having trouble logging in to samba shares on an Ubuntu machine from windows XP. It won't accept the password, even though it's correct
2008-01-19T19:59:00.000Z	stefg	stib	so your XP account is passwordless, and you are prompted for a password. you give it, but don't get access ?
2008-01-19T20:00:00.000Z	stib	stefg	nope, I've got a different user name on the XP machine, with a password. When I try to connect to the Ubuntu share I get the password dialogue
2008-01-19T20:01:00.000Z	stib	stefg	so I put in my user/pass for the ubuntu machine and it won't accept it.
2008-01-19T20:01:00.000Z	stefg	stib	you have to add the same user as in windows (name & password) to the ubuntu-machine. you simply need an account on the server
2008-01-19T20:02:00.000Z	stib	stefg	So I need to set up a new account on the Ubuntu box?
2008-01-19T20:02:00.000Z	stefg	stib	yes, makes things much easier
2008-01-19T20:03:00.000Z	stib	stefg	but the stuff I want to acccess belongs to my other username (the ubuntu box is a shared computer that all the family uses, there's only one account)
2008-01-19T20:04:00.000Z	stib	stefg	is there no way of "mapping" my windows user name to the account on the ubuntu box? or.. something like that?
2008-01-19T20:05:00.000Z	stefg	stib	you need to setup samba authentication for all the users then..... that's exactly the kind of homework question which can be solved by simply reading the docs
2008-01-19T20:06:00.000Z	stib	stefg	so what is the username field in the "connect to.." dialogue for?
2008-01-19T20:07:00.000Z	stib	stefg	if it's just using my windows login?
2008-01-19T20:09:00.000Z	stefg	stib	windows has one authentication mechanism, your user account on ubuntu has another one, and samba a third one. you can synchronize the ubuntu- and samba-account. read man smbpasswd
2008-01-19T20:10:00.000Z	stib	stefg	thanks for that
