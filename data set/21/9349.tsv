2008-07-01T16:27:00.000Z	soundray	Chicoinc	the problem is the space in the name of the mountpoints. Try /media/Disk_2 instead
2008-07-01T16:28:00.000Z	soundray	Chicoinc	also, you have duplicates in there.
2008-07-01T16:28:00.000Z	soundray	Chicoinc	I suggest you get rid  of lines 14-16
2008-07-01T16:33:00.000Z	soundray	Chicoinc	use 'sudo mount...'
2008-07-01T16:35:00.000Z	soundray	Chicoinc	to allow users to mount the device, replace 'errors=remount-ro' with 'user' in line 12
2008-07-01T16:38:00.000Z	soundray	Chicoinc	how did you get to this fstab in the first place? A lot of it just doesn't make sense
2008-07-01T16:40:00.000Z	soundray	Chicoinc	also, you shouldn't mount /dev/sda1 again since according to lines 5 and 6 it contains your root filesystem
2008-07-01T16:41:00.000Z	soundray	Chicoinc	did you make those fstab changes?
2008-07-01T16:44:00.000Z	soundray	Chicoinc	what do you expect to happen?
2008-07-01T16:45:00.000Z	soundray	Chicoinc	are you in gnome?
2008-07-01T16:47:00.000Z	soundray	Chicoinc	why did you change your fstab?
2008-07-01T16:47:00.000Z	soundray	Chicoinc	what kind of update?
2008-07-01T16:49:00.000Z	soundray	Chicoinc	which version of ubuntu do  you have?
2008-07-01T16:50:00.000Z	soundray	Chicoinc	did you upgrade to hardy from gutsy?
2008-07-01T16:51:00.000Z	soundray	Chicoinc	you don't arrive at an fstab like yours by doing a fresh installation
2008-07-01T16:53:00.000Z	soundray	Chicoinc	you've introduced a new mistake by replacing / with a space
