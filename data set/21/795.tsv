2011-06-08T21:22:00.000Z	fiftyeight		HELp: ubuntu reverts to black screen after being in loading screen for about a minute, and writes: "unable to handle kernel paging request at f8c84848"
2011-06-08T21:24:00.000Z	julie	fiftyeight	this could well be a hard drive problem
2011-06-08T21:25:00.000Z	fiftyeight	julie	it works most of the time, but quite often like it reverts to this screen
2011-06-08T21:25:00.000Z	fiftyeight	julie	is there a way to be sure what is the problem?
2011-06-08T21:25:00.000Z	julie	fiftyeight	a bad sector check would do the job
2011-06-08T21:26:00.000Z	fiftyeight	julie	can you tell how how I do this check?
2011-06-08T21:26:00.000Z	fiftyeight	julie	I also have windows on a different hard drive
2011-06-08T21:27:00.000Z	julie	fiftyeight	you could boot from a CD and run e2fsck -fc
2011-06-08T21:28:00.000Z	julie	fiftyeight	e2fsck -fc device
2011-06-08T21:28:00.000Z	fiftyeight	julie	okay, will the standard ubuntu destop CD do the job?
2011-06-08T21:29:00.000Z	julie	fiftyeight	 It's one of the options but in any case you could boot with the default option and open a terminal window
2011-06-08T21:50:00.000Z	fiftyeight	julie	hi you still here?
2011-06-08T21:51:00.000Z	fiftyeight	julie	great, I read to command e2fsck with the c option will also put bad sectors away, can I run the command without the c option? since this is a brand new HDD, if it's bad I'll want to return it to the store
2011-06-08T21:52:00.000Z	fiftyeight	julie	the previous guy I asked here told me to do memtest84 so now it's done and I can check the HDD
2011-06-08T21:52:00.000Z	julie	fiftyeight	the point of using the -c option is to check the disk's physical integrity
2011-06-08T21:53:00.000Z	julie	fiftyeight	memtest is not a bad idea but won't find anything if the problem is the drive
2011-06-08T21:54:00.000Z	julie	fiftyeight	 it can take quite a while but is worth the try
2011-06-08T21:54:00.000Z	fiftyeight	julie	k, will it tel me if it found something? what's annoying here is that this is a brand new HDD, and I'll be pretty pissed if it has problems :)
2011-06-08T21:55:00.000Z	fiftyeight	julie	so I'll want to return it probably
2011-06-08T21:55:00.000Z	julie	fiftyeight	I get your point...  it will tell you how many bad sectors were found and you'll see them showing up on the sreen as it finds them too
2011-06-08T21:55:00.000Z	fiftyeight	julie	okay, in a normal situation it should find zero bad sectors?
