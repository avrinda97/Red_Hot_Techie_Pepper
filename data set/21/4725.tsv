2008-04-11T14:23:00.000Z	gan		system is not shuuting down if i give init 0, it is saying system halted , why?
2008-04-11T14:23:00.000Z	unop	gan	thats the way init works
2008-04-11T14:24:00.000Z	gan	unop	if i give the system should go to shutdown , but the monitor is not going off
2008-04-11T14:25:00.000Z	gan	unop	it says system is halted
2008-04-11T14:25:00.000Z	unop	gan	you will need to use poweroff or better even .. shutdown -h ..
2008-04-11T14:29:00.000Z	gan	unop	usually i use to give init 0 ., it works fine , now what happen i didnt know .,
2008-04-11T14:30:00.000Z	gan	unop	what is the script running if i shutdown the PC
2008-04-11T14:31:00.000Z	unop	gan	depends, its the kernel that issues a BIOS sequence to poweroff the pc tho
2008-04-11T14:32:00.000Z	gan	unop	even if i run the command poweroff, error "system halted "
2008-04-11T14:34:00.000Z	unop	gan	why don't you use 'shutdown -h now' instead?
2008-04-11T14:35:00.000Z	gan	unop	ok i use & tell you
2008-04-11T14:37:00.000Z	gan	unop	now also i getting the same error
2008-04-11T14:38:00.000Z	gan	unop	now also i getting the same error " system halted"
2008-04-11T14:39:00.000Z	unop	gan	i'm not sure what's happening there
2008-04-11T14:40:00.000Z	gan	unop	you tell me if i run the init 0 "which script is running tell"
2008-04-11T14:40:00.000Z	unop	gan	maybe.  shutdown -P -h now #?
2008-04-11T14:41:00.000Z	gan	unop	sorry the same error
2008-04-11T14:41:00.000Z	unop	gan	it's not exactly a script - init does the work there and changes the runlevel
2008-04-11T14:41:00.000Z	gan	unop	yeah you are correct under runlevel which script what input it is taking
2008-04-11T14:43:00.000Z	unop	gan	init the command, is actually an executable (/sbin/init) and it acts on process 1 - it takes the parameters you give it, it does not call anything else (iirc)
2008-04-11T14:45:00.000Z	unop	gan	you could ask about this in #linux or perhaps even #debian - maybe they know better (just don't tell the #debian folks you run ubuntu when asking about this)
