2008-05-03T20:28:00.000Z	sisif		Hello guys. I`m using Ubuntu 7.10 (fresh re-install just the other day) on a Dell notebook and I`m having some trouble fixing a a bug that prevent the backlight to turn off when the LID is closed. On previous install I know that all I had to do is comment out line 9 in /etc/acpi/lid.sh . But now, the same fix is not working. Each time I close the LID, the backlight stays on, and I`m afraid of not burning out my laps. Is there any solution to this bug?  (I did
2008-05-03T20:29:00.000Z	sisif		 some *extensive* searching on ubuntuforums, but came up with nothing really useful).
