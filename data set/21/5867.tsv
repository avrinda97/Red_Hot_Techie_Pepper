2007-09-06T06:14:00.000Z	Ben_Cs		hello
2007-09-06T06:15:00.000Z	Ben_Cs		my ipod mounts automatically.   i can eject it only with "sudo eject". how can i eject it without "sudo"?
2007-09-06T06:16:00.000Z	dystopianray	Ben_Cs	you only need to umount it then you can disconnect it
2007-09-06T06:19:00.000Z	Ben_Cs	dystopianray	but when i "umount" it the busy light indicator is on. if i "eject" it, only then it's off
2007-09-06T06:19:00.000Z	dystopianray	Ben_Cs	the light indicates that data is being transferred?
2007-09-06T06:20:00.000Z	Ben_Cs	dystopianray	yes.
2007-09-06T06:20:00.000Z	dystopianray	Ben_Cs	data is being transferred after you unmount it?
2007-09-06T06:20:00.000Z	Ben_Cs	dystopianray	it's what the light says
2007-09-06T06:21:00.000Z	dystopianray	Ben_Cs	what is transferring data to it?
2007-09-06T06:21:00.000Z	Ben_Cs	dystopianray	don't know (the thing is in WinXP the light blinks for a sec. and then stops, so it's safe to remove. in ubuntu it blinks all the time till "eject")
2007-09-06T06:22:00.000Z	dystopianray	Ben_Cs	as long as it's unmounted it's safe to remove
2007-09-06T06:22:00.000Z	Ben_Cs	dystopianray	you sure?
2007-09-06T06:22:00.000Z	dystopianray	Ben_Cs	yes
2007-09-06T06:22:00.000Z	Ben_Cs	dystopianray	ok thanks
2007-09-06T06:23:00.000Z	dystopianray	Ben_Cs	the device is designed with windows in mind, and is deceptive when used with a different system
2007-09-06T06:23:00.000Z	dystopianray	Ben_Cs	becuase windows has no concept of mounting or unmounting
2007-09-06T06:24:00.000Z	Ben_Cs	dystopianray	but for some reason the "eject" script does the unmounting in the "windows" way :)
2007-09-06T06:25:00.000Z	dystopianray	Ben_Cs	it doesn't unmount, it ejects
2007-09-06T06:25:00.000Z	Ben_Cs	dystopianray	but ejection has umount as a part of it i guess
2007-09-06T06:26:00.000Z	dystopianray	Ben_Cs	well whatever script your using may be calling unmount before calling eject, but umount and eject are two different things
2007-09-06T06:27:00.000Z	Ben_Cs	dystopianray	i see. ok, thanks
