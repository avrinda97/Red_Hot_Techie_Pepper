2008-06-07T03:18:00.000Z	Gaming4JC		:(
2008-06-07T03:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	Gaming4JC	your cd is on the sources.list by default so if a package can be instaled from it; it will
2008-06-07T03:31:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	erUSUL	I alreadly know how to connect. It's just degrading on speed all of a sudden.
2008-06-07T03:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	Gaming4JC	something on the logs?? /var/log/messages /var/log/syslog
2009-10-18T02:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	Gaming4JC	-11 has the apropiate module -15 does not ?
2009-10-18T02:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	Gaming4JC	what graphjic card and driver are you using and how you installed said driver ?
2009-10-18T02:27:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	erUSUL	I installed the graphics driver using proprietary drivers from ATI Radeon.
2009-10-18T02:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	Gaming4JC	from the ati website ? or using the ones in the repositories ?
2009-10-18T02:28:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	erUSUL	So it is possible it's not configured, yet it says it's working properly from the catylst control panel even though it's not. ATI's website, the one in the repos didn't work at all.
2009-10-18T02:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	Gaming4JC	you have to rinstall the drivers averytime the kernel changes ( maybe there is a way to automate this i dunno)
2009-10-18T02:32:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	erUSUL	How might I reinstall the drivers for my ATI Radeon btw? It says it's already installed so that kind of makes it strange.
2009-10-18T02:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	Gaming4JC	i really dunno. never used ati installer. with the nvidia installer you just rerun it
