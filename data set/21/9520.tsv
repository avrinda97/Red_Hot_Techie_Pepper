2006-04-14T13:30:00.000Z	luis_		Hello, I've just installed gnome-bluetooth but I don't know the passcode to complete the connection between my PC and my bluetooth device. Any ideas on what's the default?
2006-04-14T13:31:00.000Z	BlueEagle	luis_	Which bluetooth device?
2006-04-14T13:31:00.000Z	luis_	BlueEagle	my mobile phone, sony w600
2006-04-14T13:33:00.000Z	BlueEagle	luis_	You will be asked for the passcode when connecting. Just enter a code and enter the same code on your phone.
2006-04-14T13:33:00.000Z	BlueEagle	luis_	Atleast that's how it works with the T610, K700i and w800
2006-04-14T13:33:00.000Z	luis_	BlueEagle	It just prompts for the passcode, and anything I type in it says it's wrong...
2006-04-14T13:34:00.000Z	BlueEagle	luis_	You may need to set up the phone to ask for passcodes instead of using a default one. Please refer to the phone manual.
2006-04-14T13:34:00.000Z	luis_	BlueEagle	ok I'll do that, thank you!
2006-04-14T13:38:00.000Z	luis_	BlueEagle	how can I send a file from the PC to the mobile? the inverse way I got working
2006-04-14T13:39:00.000Z	BlueEagle	luis_	hmm.. hang on.
2006-04-14T13:45:00.000Z	luis_	BlueEagle	any luck? I got none yet :P
2006-04-14T13:46:00.000Z	BlueEagle	luis_	I found one "filesharing with bluetooth" thingy, but it won't load. Atleat not in dapper.
2006-04-14T13:47:00.000Z	luis_	BlueEagle	I found one thing telling me to right click a file and select 'send via bluetooth' but there's no such thing :P
2006-04-14T13:50:00.000Z	BlueEagle	luis_	Actually I've got that feature in dapper
2006-04-14T13:51:00.000Z	BlueEagle	luis_	Right click and choose "Send To"
2006-04-14T13:51:00.000Z	BlueEagle	luis_	There you can choose evolution or Bluetooth (OBEX)
2006-04-14T13:51:00.000Z	luis_	BlueEagle	there's only evolution on Send to
2006-04-14T13:52:00.000Z	BlueEagle	luis_	have you got the Bluetooth (OBEX) option then?
2006-04-14T13:53:00.000Z	luis_	BlueEagle	no bluetooth under Send To
2006-04-14T13:53:00.000Z	BlueEagle	luis_	Hmm.. have you got gnome-bluetooth installed?
2006-04-14T13:54:00.000Z	luis_	BlueEagle	yes I got
