2010-11-08T21:16:00.000Z	blue_anna	StaRetji1	, there are links at the top of that article on how to get started editing your crontab

2010-11-08T21:15:00.000Z	StaRetji1	blue_anna	Thank you for the link, I have read many, but as I'm a bit dumb, I don't understand where to paste this lines. I mean how exactly to execute it. And what will happen if I execute it twice? Thx
2010-11-08T21:16:00.000Z	StaRetji1	blue_anna	is is just crontab - 0 */1 * * *
2010-11-08T21:17:00.000Z	blue_anna	StaRetji1	each line in the crontab is a single instruction with its own independent time and command specifications
2010-11-08T21:18:00.000Z	blue_anna	StaRetji1	so two lines that say the same thing will spawn two processes doing the same thing at the same time
2010-11-08T21:18:00.000Z	StaRetji1	blue_anna	thx for clarifiying that
2010-11-08T21:18:00.000Z	StaRetji1	blue_anna	so crontab is a file, right?
2010-11-08T21:19:00.000Z	blue_anna	StaRetji1	it is.. sorta .. there's a crontab for each user. the command "crontab" manages these
2010-11-08T21:20:00.000Z	StaRetji1	blue_anna	and Pici, thank you both for helping out ;)
2010-11-08T21:22:00.000Z	blue_anna	StaRetji1	if you need to run something as another user (eg root), you should run the crontab command form that user id and add it to their crontab
2010-11-08T21:22:00.000Z	blue_anna	StaRetji1	if you want, there is documentation on your computer already for cron
2010-11-08T21:22:00.000Z	blue_anna	StaRetji1	man crontab or man cron ... man -k cron (gnome-schedule looks promising)
2010-11-08T21:24:00.000Z	StaRetji1	blue_anna	thx, I've noticed that there is now new dir and crontab in /tmp Will copying this dir and folder and paste it on other machine work?
2010-11-08T21:24:00.000Z	StaRetji1	blue_anna	I ask this in case I forget all of this, I just paste that dir and file in /tmp will work, all I get it wrong?
2010-11-08T21:25:00.000Z	StaRetji1	blue_anna	Sorry if question is stupid, I'm not tech person :/
2010-11-08T21:27:00.000Z	StaRetji1	blue_anna	found out that myself, file disappeared once I've finish editing it.
2010-11-08T21:28:00.000Z	blue_anna	StaRetji1	crontab -l|xclip -selection "clipboard" and then paste it into an email to yourself
2010-11-08T21:29:00.000Z	StaRetji1	blue_anna	I guess if I paste root file in /var/spool/cron/crontabs/ it will work another machine?
2010-11-08T21:31:00.000Z	blue_anna	StaRetji1	I bet that's it .. you could check on the web or in your system's man pages for information about the files used in crontab
2010-11-08T21:31:00.000Z	blue_anna	StaRetji1	crontab -l works for the current user
