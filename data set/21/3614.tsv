2008-11-12T07:00:00.000Z	Pici	mylisto	we appreciate the enthusiasm, but the language isn't necessary.
2009-03-26T16:50:00.000Z	Pici	mylisto	Run it from a terminal
2010-04-26T19:24:00.000Z	Pici	mylisto	What do you mean by "manually update and upgrade" ?
2010-04-26T19:25:00.000Z	Pici	mylisto	How did you try to upgrade originally?
2010-04-26T19:27:00.000Z	Pici	mylisto	You should have had to upgrade to 8.10 first.
2011-02-28T04:59:00.000Z	Pici	mylisto	Many people are, its best to ask your specific question about it.
2011-02-28T05:00:00.000Z	mylisto	Pici	when I use the following command to restart apache "sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart" I get
2011-02-28T05:02:00.000Z	Pici	mylisto	Do you already have something already running on port 80? check   sudo netstat -tanp | grep ":80"

2011-02-28T05:05:00.000Z	Pici	mylisto	Okay, now try: ps aux | grep httpd
2011-02-28T05:07:00.000Z	Pici	mylisto	It looks like you're using some third-party lamp stack.
2011-02-28T05:08:00.000Z	Pici	mylisto	Just like that.
2011-02-28T05:08:00.000Z	Pici	mylisto	Is there a reason you aren't using the versions of apache/mysql/etc that are in the Ubuntu repositiories?
2011-02-28T05:09:00.000Z	Pici	mylisto	I don't know, how did you install it?
2011-02-28T05:12:00.000Z	Pici	mylisto	I'd *guess* that you'd need to delete /opt/lampp, but unfortunately xampp's documentation is blank in the 'uninstalling xampp' section.
