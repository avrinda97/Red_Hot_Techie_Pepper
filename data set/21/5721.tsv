2008-05-25T13:44:00.000Z	Sitherae		Do ati drivers work well?
2008-05-25T13:46:00.000Z	Carbonflux	Sitherae	they get better all the time and soon should be very good, in the past they have been weak, still some issues, but usable imo, I use them for my laptop
2008-05-25T13:46:00.000Z	Sitherae	Carbonflux	What is the better alternative?
2008-05-25T13:48:00.000Z	Carbonflux	Sitherae	if you have a ati card and need acceleration none really, the open source driver only does 2D acceleration iirc
2008-05-25T13:48:00.000Z	Sitherae	Carbonflux	I have an nvidia
2008-05-25T13:48:00.000Z	Sitherae	Carbonflux	Did I say ati up there? Sorry if I did lol. I meant. Are nvidia drivers any good
2008-05-25T13:48:00.000Z	Carbonflux	Sitherae	the ati drivers will not work with nvidia boards, the nivida drivers are quite good
2008-05-25T13:49:00.000Z	Carbonflux	Sitherae	the nVidia drivers are good
2008-05-25T13:49:00.000Z	Sitherae	Carbonflux	Are there any better alternatives?
2008-05-25T13:49:00.000Z	Carbonflux	Sitherae	well, if we are talking about the restricted drivers from nVidia you can't do any better
2008-05-25T13:50:00.000Z	Sitherae	Carbonflux	Alright thanks.
2008-05-25T13:50:00.000Z	Carbonflux	Sitherae	when you installed did you also active the restricted driver?
2008-05-25T13:50:00.000Z	Sitherae	Carbonflux	Im not having a problem with my driver. Just wanting to update to see if I can get Age of Conan to work in Wine.
2008-05-25T13:51:00.000Z	Carbonflux	Sitherae	be interesting to find out if you can, thats a fairly cutting edge app, it might run a bit slow
2008-05-25T13:52:00.000Z	Sitherae	Carbonflux	Well I'm only getting 12-15 fps in windows. Seeing if ubuntu runs it anybetter
2008-05-25T13:53:00.000Z	Carbonflux	Sitherae	what kind of hardware do you have?
2008-05-25T13:53:00.000Z	Sitherae	Carbonflux	7600 GTS. But. I have an 8800 GTS OC'd to 670 mhz in the mail to my house right now :D
2008-05-25T13:54:00.000Z	Carbonflux	Sitherae	ya, with the 7600 you just don't have the shader support, its not going to be faster in Ubuntu
2008-05-25T13:54:00.000Z	Sitherae	Carbonflux	I see.
2008-05-25T13:54:00.000Z	Sitherae	Carbonflux	Damn >.>
2008-05-25T13:55:00.000Z	Carbonflux	Sitherae	heh ya, soon linux gaming is going to get better tho, with this port of Half Life starting it off.
