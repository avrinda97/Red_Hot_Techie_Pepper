2005-12-11T07:01:00.000Z	libervisco		so how can I make apt-get update to download only changes in the repo database and not the whole database every time it's ran?
2005-12-11T07:02:00.000Z	victor	libervisco	when i run apt-get update it only updates the changes in the database
2005-12-11T07:02:00.000Z	victor		are you sure it downloads the whole database each time you run it?
2005-12-11T07:02:00.000Z	libervisco	victor	yes.. the same as I when i was running it the first time
2005-12-11T07:02:00.000Z	libervisco		it's breezy
2005-12-11T07:03:00.000Z	libervisco		that chunk of some 500kb and then that 2MB chunk which takes about 15 minutes on modem
2005-12-11T07:03:00.000Z	victor	libervisco	try using aptitude instead apt-get
2005-12-11T07:03:00.000Z	victor		it usually works better
2005-12-11T07:03:00.000Z	libervisco	victor	Why would that be different? I already used synaptic and it's the same
2005-12-11T07:05:00.000Z	victor		with aptitude, when you install sth which depends of other packages, and then you want to remove that main package, it will remove the dependant packages as well
2005-12-11T07:05:00.000Z	victor		may be with aptitude your database is updated correctly
2005-12-11T07:06:00.000Z	victor		but i had your problem as well, i didn't remember
2005-12-11T07:06:00.000Z	libervisco	victor	hm.. I'll give it a try but it worked properly on hoary
2005-12-11T07:06:00.000Z	libervisco		there must be a way to fix it
2005-12-11T07:07:00.000Z	victor		that was because the update-notifier tries always to update the database, every time you turn on your pc
2005-12-11T07:07:00.000Z	victor		and sometimes i only turn on the pc for 1 minute or less
2005-12-11T07:07:00.000Z	victor		so it usually didn't have time to finish the update
2005-12-11T07:07:00.000Z	victor		try disabling that option
2005-12-11T07:08:00.000Z	victor		it worked for me
2005-12-11T07:08:00.000Z	victor		i'm going have lunch
2005-12-11T07:08:00.000Z	libervisco	victor	alright, I'll try that.. I'm on dial up so I'm not even always on and it therefore can't update it
