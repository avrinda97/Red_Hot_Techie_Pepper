2007-06-21T05:58:00.000Z	dreemr		what permission shoudl I give a directory in /media in order to be use as USEr
2007-06-21T05:58:00.000Z	dreemr		please
2007-06-21T05:58:00.000Z	dreemr		someone
2007-06-21T05:58:00.000Z	Warbo	dreemr	What filesystem is it?
2007-06-21T05:58:00.000Z	dreemr	Warbo	XFS
2007-06-21T05:58:00.000Z	dreemr	Warbo	someone told me to use that
2007-06-21T05:59:00.000Z	Warbo	dreemr	Hmm... Then it should retain permissions for the files
2007-06-21T05:59:00.000Z	dreemr	Warbo	but now it tells me I do'nt have permission to use that directory
2007-06-21T05:59:00.000Z	Warbo	dreemr	Check what user "owns" that directory
2007-06-21T05:59:00.000Z	dreemr	Warbo	how do  I do that
2007-06-21T06:00:00.000Z	Warbo	dreemr	right click the folder and go on properties, and then the permission tab
2007-06-21T06:00:00.000Z	Warbo	dreemr	you are in a GUI?
2007-06-21T06:00:00.000Z	dreemr	Warbo	lol both ROOOT
2007-06-21T06:01:00.000Z	Warbo	dreemr	OK, you can change it to your user by running "sudo chown -R <your username> /media/<whatever the directory is>"
2007-06-21T06:02:00.000Z	dreemr	Warbo	that's it?
2007-06-21T06:02:00.000Z	Warbo	dreemr	That should go through the directory and the directories in it, etc. etc. changing the owner to you
2007-06-21T06:04:00.000Z	dreemr	Warbo	thanks that worked
2007-06-21T06:04:00.000Z	Warbo	dreemr	No problem :)
