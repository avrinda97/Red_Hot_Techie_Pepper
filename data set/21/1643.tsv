2011-12-03T00:22:00.000Z	bagels		I'm using a Dell Inspiron 1090.  I can't get the touchscreen to calibrate.  The Y axis is always inverted.
2011-12-03T00:22:00.000Z	bagels		Can anyone help  me calibrate it?

2011-12-03T00:24:00.000Z	Ampelbein	bagels	Is it an Elo touchscreen?
2011-12-03T00:25:00.000Z	bagels	Ampelbein	I don't know, it's installed in the laptop.  How do I find out?
2011-12-03T00:26:00.000Z	Ampelbein	bagels	'sudo lshw | grep Elo'
2011-12-03T00:27:00.000Z	bagels	Ampelbein	it just says ... no wait, it went away.
2011-12-03T00:28:00.000Z	Ampelbein	bagels	I looked up the inspiron 1090, seems it's an eGalax touchscreen.
2011-12-03T00:29:00.000Z	bagels	Ampelbein	escott , here's a pastebin of xinput list-props
2011-12-03T00:29:00.000Z	bagels	Ampelbein	escott I installed the driver but it refuses to configure.
2011-12-03T00:31:00.000Z	Ampelbein	bagels	Is there a file called /usr/share/hal/fdi/policy/20thirdparty/50-eGalax.fdi ?
2011-12-03T00:32:00.000Z	bagels	Ampelbein	there isn't even a 20thirdparty folder.
2011-12-03T00:34:00.000Z	Ampelbein	bagels	If you are on 10.10 or newer: /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/ should contain the configuration files.
2011-12-03T00:34:00.000Z	bagels	Ampelbein	what do i do with these
2011-12-03T00:34:00.000Z	Ampelbein	bagels	Look if there is a mention of eGalax in any. If so, please pastebin it.

2011-12-03T00:38:00.000Z	Ampelbein	bagels	Try to add 'Option "InvertY" "1" ' under the line with Driver "evdev"
2011-12-03T00:38:00.000Z	Ampelbein	bagels	and reboot.
2011-12-03T00:42:00.000Z	bagels	Ampelbein	didn't help
2011-12-03T00:45:00.000Z	Ampelbein	bagels	I'm out of ideas then, maybe try asking on askubuntu.com
