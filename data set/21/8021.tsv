2006-06-09T14:27:00.000Z	dpod		Has anybody else had a problem with LTS knocking out working eth0 from Breezy? I.e. losing wired internet after updating.
2006-06-09T14:28:00.000Z	SeanTater	dpod	no eth) problems here (But I updated from flight7, not breezy)
2006-06-09T14:29:00.000Z	dpod	SeanTater	I had it work fine on one box and not on the other. Weird thing is I've never had trouble with eth on Ubuntu before.
2006-06-09T14:30:00.000Z	SeanTater	dpod	try this in a terminal --> ifdown eth0 ; ifup eth0
2006-06-09T14:30:00.000Z	SeanTater	dpod	it restarts the networking
2006-06-09T14:32:00.000Z	SeanTater	dpod	ping
2006-06-09T14:32:00.000Z	SeanTater	dpod	still here?
2006-06-09T14:32:00.000Z	dpod	SeanTater	No luck. I'm noogetting a DHCPDiscover. I'm guessing it must be a config file but don't know where to start looking. I am getting a problem with postconf as part of the ifdown or network restart
2006-06-09T14:33:00.000Z	SeanTater	dpod	-- it looks like dhcp is not there
2006-06-09T14:33:00.000Z	SeanTater	dpod	do you have a router?
2006-06-09T14:34:00.000Z	dpod	SeanTater	yes. The problem is that it isn't receiving a DHCP offer. And if I give it a fixed IP I still get nothing.
2006-06-09T14:35:00.000Z	SeanTater	dpod	okay -- you can only give it a static IP if you are behind a router -- assuming you are -- you'll need to put in DNS too, did you do that?
2006-06-09T14:36:00.000Z	dpod	SeanTater	there was an entry already: it points to the router. Right now I'm still looking for dhcp, since that's what I've always done and since it only caused problems after the upgrade.
2006-06-09T14:38:00.000Z	SeanTater	dpod	good -- the dns server should ususally point to the router -- but for dhcp -- try the following in a terminal ans pastebin it's output
2006-06-09T14:38:00.000Z	SeanTater	dpod	find /usr/sbin -name '*dhcp*'
2006-06-09T14:39:00.000Z	SeanTater	dpod	sorry -- that won't work
2006-06-09T14:39:00.000Z	dpod	SeanTater	nothing came anyway.
2006-06-09T14:39:00.000Z	SeanTater	dpod	From here I don;t know what to say except make sure it's plugged in.
2006-06-09T14:40:00.000Z	SeanTater	dpod	you might try unplugging and plugging back in the router..
2006-06-09T14:40:00.000Z	dpod	SeanTater	Checked if it was plugged in first ;). The router is working, since two other computers are running through it: one wireless and one wired.
2006-06-09T14:41:00.000Z	SeanTater	dpod	I know it's wprking but I'd reset it anyway
