2008-08-08T11:52:00.000Z	Scorp_		Guys, I am unable to access the router page in ubuntu using firefox.. Its working with OpenSUSE/Firefox, Windows/Firefox but not ubuntu... What could be the reason ???
2008-08-08T11:53:00.000Z	Scorp_		Its a Linksys Router!!
2008-08-08T11:54:00.000Z	RoshanK	Scorp_	did you try entering the default ip for the router into firefox?
2008-08-08T11:55:00.000Z	Scorp_	RoshanK	Yeah.. its  192.168.1.1.. Thats wat i have been using all the while.. I used a liveCD of OpenSUSE and it can access... But Ubuntu cannot
2008-08-08T11:55:00.000Z	RoshanK	Scorp_	its usually 192.168.x.xx
2008-08-08T11:55:00.000Z	Scorp_	RoshanK	yupp... thats wat am using... i get a prompt for username and password... after that just a blank white screen and loading at the bottom right...
2008-08-08T11:56:00.000Z	RoshanK	Scorp_	oh thats weird
2008-08-08T11:56:00.000Z	Scorp_	RoshanK	I was using Wireless, but just to confirm that its not a wireless problem, i used a wire and same issue.. Even to rule out the Linux issue, i used OpenSUSE and thats working... So it shudnt be an issue altogether...
2008-08-08T11:57:00.000Z	RoshanK	Scorp_	im not an expert on this, but assuming, is it possibly a firefox issue on ur ubuntu installation? do u have noscript enabled or something that may keep it from continuing the loading?
2008-08-08T11:58:00.000Z	Scorp_	RoshanK	I believe there's something stopping the CGI Script from functioning properly... Is there anything that can be done about it ?
2008-08-08T11:59:00.000Z	RoshanK	Scorp_	have u installed any extensions in firefox on the ubunt install?
2008-08-08T11:59:00.000Z	Scorp_	RoshanK	No.. its a basic firefox 3...
2008-08-08T12:00:00.000Z	RoshanK	Scorp_	have any other broswer that can go to that ip address? maybe opera? if u dont then dont go install. im not an expert in this, so i wouldnt wanna waste ur time. but im just assuing that there's something in firefox that's preventing the loading of the page after authentication
2008-08-08T12:01:00.000Z	Scorp_	RoshanK	I tried even Opera, that doesnt work too...
2008-08-08T12:01:00.000Z	RoshanK	Scorp_	o.O
2008-08-08T12:02:00.000Z	Scorp_	RoshanK	joejoecircusboy, i think its basically something to do with Ubuntu.. I mean, could dere be a firewall or anyting lyk dat which is there by default ??
2008-08-08T12:02:00.000Z	RoshanK	Scorp_	on another note yesterday my 2wire gateway's home page had a weird error for apparently no reason
2008-08-08T12:03:00.000Z	RoshanK	Scorp_	and u said other pc's are able to access the router page though?
2008-08-08T12:03:00.000Z	Scorp_	RoshanK	yeah... even my little P1i mobile can.. so thats something thats really irritating...
2008-08-08T12:08:00.000Z	RoshanK	Scorp_	i know i asked u this, but ur positive u didnt install any extension like noscript or maybe adblock plus on?
2008-08-08T12:08:00.000Z	Scorp_	RoshanK	nah.. I dont believe in so much security...
