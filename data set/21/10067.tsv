2005-05-20T12:59:00.000Z	Gnimsh		hello
2005-05-20T13:00:00.000Z	Gnimsh		thanks
2005-05-20T13:01:00.000Z	Gnimsh		kestas?
2005-05-20T13:01:00.000Z	Gnimsh		why is that?
2005-05-20T13:02:00.000Z	Gnimsh		kk
2005-05-20T13:03:00.000Z	Gnimsh		next question.  I get to the part about setting users and passwords, and what I type for the pass does not show up on the sc reen, but it does go through the process when I hit enter.  Does the installer not echo the password for security?
2005-05-20T13:03:00.000Z	Gnimsh		lol
2005-05-20T13:03:00.000Z	Seveas	Gnimsh	it;s a security measure indeed
2005-05-20T13:16:00.000Z	Seveas	Gnimsh	the password you use to login?
2005-05-20T13:17:00.000Z	Seveas	Gnimsh	are you logged in as the user you created during the install?
2005-05-20T13:18:00.000Z	Seveas	Gnimsh	in a terminal you type: sudo apt-get update
2005-05-20T13:20:00.000Z	Gnimsh	Seveas	I'm running apt get now
2005-05-20T13:21:00.000Z	Gnimsh	Seveas	I went to applications, run application
2005-05-20T13:21:00.000Z	Seveas	Gnimsh	not really
2005-05-20T13:22:00.000Z	Seveas	Gnimsh	try applications -> system tools -> root terminal and use your password
2005-05-20T13:22:00.000Z	Seveas	Gnimsh	see whether that works
2005-05-20T13:23:00.000Z	Seveas	Gnimsh	it won't take your password?
2005-05-20T13:23:00.000Z	Seveas	Gnimsh	how long is this password?
2005-05-20T13:26:00.000Z	Seveas	Gnimsh	go to applications -> system tools -> terminal
2005-05-20T13:31:00.000Z	Seveas	Gnimsh	do you have pen and paper nearby? I will give you some instructions to do, but you have to reboot for it
2005-05-20T13:32:00.000Z	Seveas	Gnimsh	can i talk to you in private, that'll be easier
