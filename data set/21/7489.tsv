2006-09-18T14:12:00.000Z	mrtaran12345		not sure if this is the right room for this, but anyone have experience using nvidia card on a laptop... hotkey for external monitor?
2006-09-18T14:12:00.000Z	comtech	mrtaran12345	hotkey doesn't work
2006-09-18T14:12:00.000Z	mrtaran12345	comtech	its working for me
2006-09-18T14:12:00.000Z	comtech	mrtaran12345	you need to setup the xorg.conf file
2006-09-18T14:12:00.000Z	comtech	mrtaran12345	really? mine doesn't
2006-09-18T14:12:00.000Z	mrtaran12345	comtech	are you using toshiba?
2006-09-18T14:14:00.000Z	comtech	mrtaran12345	dell
2006-09-18T14:14:00.000Z	mrtaran12345	comtech	i booted up and my 21" popped up etc... but its not using it's own config.. its using generic or my laptop's config because i dont know how to set the external monitor's config to "external monitor"
2006-09-18T14:15:00.000Z	mrtaran12345	comtech	its using my laptop's resolution of 1200x780
2006-09-18T14:15:00.000Z	comtech	mrtaran12345	you need to setup xorg.conf for that. Does your hotkey work to switch when you're already in X?
2006-09-18T14:15:00.000Z	mrtaran12345	comtech	im using dell inspiron 8500
2006-09-18T14:15:00.000Z	mrtaran12345	comtech	i cant switch out of it when im in X
2006-09-18T14:19:00.000Z	mrtaran12345	comtech	do you use twinmode?
2006-09-18T14:19:00.000Z	comtech	mrtaran12345	yeah
2006-09-18T14:20:00.000Z	comtech	mrtaran12345	you need to setup two device profiles and two monitor profiles in xorg.conf
2006-09-18T14:20:00.000Z	mrtaran12345	comtech	i did that already.. but how would i link them to the xorglayout etc?
2006-09-18T14:21:00.000Z	comtech	mrtaran12345	it's all in the readme
2006-09-18T14:21:00.000Z	comtech	mrtaran12345	the readme for sure gives instructions on setting it up
2006-09-18T14:22:00.000Z	mrtaran12345	comtech	only for twinmode it gives good instructions for that
2006-09-18T14:22:00.000Z	comtech	mrtaran12345	it's the same config file.. you just need to add another device and another monitor then setup the screen and serverlayout to reflect those
2006-09-18T14:23:00.000Z	mrtaran12345	comtech	ill switch to twinmode
