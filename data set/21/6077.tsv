2007-06-07T14:25:00.000Z	kanzie		I have problems getting my external monitor to work!
2007-06-07T14:26:00.000Z	Yert	kanzie	I'd like to help, but you're getting into voodoo now
2007-06-07T14:31:00.000Z	kanzie	Yert	I see, but Im ready, gloves on, xorg will crawl on its knees when we are done with her! :-)
2007-06-07T14:32:00.000Z	kanzie	Yert	My friend has the same machine and install (though running beryl aswell) and he only had to restart X, while that does not seem to do the trick for me. He has mirroring now which is better than me, since its black, but only half the distance!
2007-06-07T14:33:00.000Z	Yert	kanzie	I know that there is an option to enable a second monitor in the xorg.conf - you may have to add it, though.  I ran dual screens on an nvidia card a couple of years back
2007-06-07T14:34:00.000Z	Yert	kanzie	well, you have to define a second monitor, for one - you should have a section that begins with [monitor] 
2007-06-07T14:35:00.000Z	Yert	kanzie	duplicate it, but change the h-refresh and v-refresh to match the second monitor
2007-06-07T14:52:00.000Z	kanzie	Yert	Any ideas?
2007-06-07T14:54:00.000Z	Yert	kanzie	eh?  sorry, got distracted :)
2007-06-07T14:55:00.000Z	kanzie	Yert	we are trying to pry my external monitor into gear, right now its black
2007-06-07T14:55:00.000Z	kanzie	Yert	Im running Feasty
2007-06-07T14:56:00.000Z	Yert	kanzie	try that link I just posted
2007-06-07T14:57:00.000Z	kanzie	Yert	Didnt get any, cant see any links from you
2007-06-07T15:01:00.000Z	kanzie	Yert	yeah, but Im running ATI-based graphics card, any ideas then?
2007-06-07T15:03:00.000Z	Yert	kanzie	bugger.  lemme look around a sec
2007-06-07T15:03:00.000Z	kanzie	Yert	Thanks!
2007-06-07T15:06:00.000Z	kanzie	Yert	Im trying to reinstall the graphics-drivers and installing beryl while Im at it, should I go with the open-source or closed-source drivers?
2007-06-07T15:06:00.000Z	Yert	kanzie	hey, go to
2007-06-07T15:07:00.000Z	Yert	kanzie	get all that?
2007-06-07T15:18:00.000Z	Yert	kanzie	I'd go with closed, as they're more mature
2007-06-07T15:18:00.000Z	Yert	kanzie	but if you want a totally open (free as in speech) system, then obviously, closed is bad :)
