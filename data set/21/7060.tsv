2006-12-28T11:15:00.000Z	arrenlex	amicrawle	Open kcontrol.
2006-12-28T11:15:00.000Z	arrenlex	amicrawle	Desktop - Behavior
2006-12-28T11:15:00.000Z	arrenlex	amicrawle	File Icons tab
2006-12-28T11:15:00.000Z	arrenlex	amicrawle	Check what you want previews for.
2006-12-28T11:17:00.000Z	arrenlex	amicrawle	Look in konqueror - settings - configure konqueror - "previews and meta-data"
2006-12-28T11:17:00.000Z	arrenlex	amicrawle	I suggest checking all local protocols and seeing what happens.
2006-12-28T11:19:00.000Z	arrenlex	amicrawle	If that doesn't work, use google. In particular, this is the first result I got for "konqueror video previews" : http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?t=299762
2006-12-28T11:19:00.000Z	arrenlex	amicrawle	It looks very helpful.
2006-12-28T11:20:00.000Z	arrenlex	amicrawle	From that page, this in particular is exactly relevant to ubuntu: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=3307
2006-12-28T11:21:00.000Z	arrenlex	amicrawle	If none of THAT helps you, I'm sorry, but I'm out of ideas.
2006-12-28T11:21:00.000Z	arrenlex	amicrawle	Next time ask on #kubuntu for KDE questions. Also, google is your friend.
