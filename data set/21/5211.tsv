2007-12-31T02:07:00.000Z	alzamabar_		I need to create an init script and to link it with a run level. Can anyone help?
2007-12-31T02:07:00.000Z	bruenig	alzamabar_	what is the problem
2007-12-31T02:08:00.000Z	alzamabar_	bruenig	I don't know how to do it
2007-12-31T02:08:00.000Z	bruenig	alzamabar_	do you know how to write bash scripts?
2007-12-31T02:08:00.000Z	alzamabar_		Is a bash script something that ends with .sh?
2007-12-31T02:08:00.000Z	bruenig	alzamabar_	file extensions don't mean anything
2007-12-31T02:08:00.000Z	bruenig		as a convention .sh is not really bash per se, it is sh
2007-12-31T02:09:00.000Z	alzamabar_	bruenig	I've got a .sh which I'd like to start as a daemon, that's my problem
2007-12-31T02:09:00.000Z	bruenig	alzamabar_	pastebin it
2007-12-31T02:09:00.000Z	bruenig		!paste
2007-12-31T02:09:00.000Z	alzamabar_	bruenig	what does pastebin mean? :-)
2007-12-31T02:10:00.000Z	bruenig	alzamabar_	paste the contents of the file where ubotu just told you to
2007-12-31T02:10:00.000Z	bruenig		what is lexx
2007-12-31T02:10:00.000Z	bruenig		no
2007-12-31T02:12:00.000Z	alzamabar_	bruenig	this is the URL: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/50168/
2007-12-31T02:12:00.000Z	alzamabar_	bruenig	if I run this script manually it works fine. I'd like this to start when Ubuntu starts
2007-12-31T02:13:00.000Z	bruenig	alzamabar_	ok I just wanted to see if it was actually a daemon, first, move the file into /etc/init.d
2007-12-31T02:13:00.000Z	alzamabar_	bruenig	ok
2007-12-31T02:15:00.000Z	alzamabar_	bruenig	done
2007-12-31T02:15:00.000Z	bruenig	alzamabar_	ok I think there is some script which will do all the linking but I don't know its name, update-rc.d maybe, you will have to ask someone
2007-12-31T02:15:00.000Z	alzamabar_	bruenig	thanks
