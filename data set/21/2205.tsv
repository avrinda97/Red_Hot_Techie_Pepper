2010-01-18T14:48:00.000Z	Diverdude		Hmm, i am copying files to my external HD via USB2. Theoretical speedlimit is 420Mbit = ~50MB per second. My ubuntu only transfers 17MB persec. Does ubuntu have some sort of problem with high speed transfers?
2010-01-18T14:50:00.000Z	jami	Diverdude	Some external 2,5" hdd need an external power supply to reach full speed
2010-01-18T14:50:00.000Z	jami	Diverdude	or a splitted usb cable
2010-01-18T14:50:00.000Z	Diverdude	jami	it has external powersupply
2010-01-18T14:50:00.000Z	jami	Diverdude	then something is going wrong
2010-01-18T14:51:00.000Z	Diverdude	jami	yes i figured, but what?
2010-01-18T14:52:00.000Z	Diverdude	jami	 or is the conclusion that linux cannot handle USB properly?
2010-01-18T14:52:00.000Z	jami	Diverdude	try to reload the ehci_hcd mod
2010-01-18T14:53:00.000Z	Diverdude	jami	no idea how i do that
2010-01-18T14:53:00.000Z	jami	Diverdude	rmmod ehci_hcd && modprobe ehci_hcd
2010-01-18T14:54:00.000Z	Diverdude	jami	are all attached devices then affected?
2010-01-18T14:54:00.000Z	jami	Diverdude	yes
2010-01-18T14:55:00.000Z	jami	Diverdude	let the devices attached
2010-01-18T14:55:00.000Z	Diverdude	jami	furthermore, speed seems to be negatively correlated with time
2010-01-18T14:56:00.000Z	jami	Diverdude	hm
2010-01-18T14:56:00.000Z	jami	Diverdude	are you sure?
2010-01-18T14:56:00.000Z	Diverdude	jami	im down to 16MB now
2010-01-18T14:56:00.000Z	Diverdude	jami	started on 17,3-17,5
2010-01-18T14:56:00.000Z	jami	Diverdude	reprobing the device did not work?
2010-01-18T14:57:00.000Z	Diverdude	jami	i have to wait to try that....im in the middle of a transferral right now
2010-01-18T14:57:00.000Z	jami	Diverdude	k
