2008-07-11T03:07:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix		Swish ext3 defragging tools are hard to come by. The easiest method is to move everything off the partition, then back onto the partition.
2008-07-11T03:08:00.000Z	Swish	ArthurArchnix	*nod* :(
2008-07-11T03:10:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Swish	I recall seeing someone had written a script... someone credible, but I'm having trouble finding it and he did it more as a proof of concept than a supported program.
2008-07-11T03:10:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Swish	Using ext2 tools is pretty risky.
2008-07-11T03:12:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Swish	No one could argue that ext3 doesn't fragment. It's just very hard to get it to fragment so much that it affects performance. But certainly, using it as a rotating backup hard-drive sounds like one of those ways. Perhaps you ought to consider a different fs than ext3?
2008-07-11T03:12:00.000Z	Swish	ArthurArchnix	 I wish I could.  Part of the problem is this is a remote server (headless) and if I had access to it I could simply defrag it or whatever myself from the console, but I don't :)
2008-07-11T03:13:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Swish	Ok... well, let me take a look for that script I told you about. Like I said, I trusted the source.
2008-07-11T03:13:00.000Z	Swish	ArthurArchnix	I'd appreciate that :)
2008-07-11T03:23:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Swish	Ok, here you go http://polishlinux.org/apps/cli/defragmentation-of-linux-filesystems/
2008-07-11T03:23:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Swish	Not quite what I remembered, but it was a while ago
2008-07-11T03:24:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Swish	Basically, it's risky and if you've got a bunch of large files (say more than 2GB's) or not much free space (say only 30%), you may not have much luck.
2008-07-11T03:24:00.000Z	Swish	ArthurArchnix	yeah this doesn't look very promising.. neither one, as they don't do free-space consolidation
2008-07-11T03:25:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Swish	And you can't switch to xfs?
2008-07-11T03:25:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Swish	Free space consolidation?
2008-07-11T03:25:00.000Z	Swish	ArthurArchnix	even if I did have access to the console I probably wouldn't.  After reading about fs reliability, ext3 > [jfs, xfs] > reiser
2008-07-11T03:25:00.000Z	Swish	ArthurArchnix	"defragging the free space"
2008-07-11T03:26:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Swish	umm... how do you defrag free space?
2008-07-11T03:26:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Swish	Put it all together?
2008-07-11T03:26:00.000Z	Swish	ArthurArchnix	you move files around so that the free space ends up in one big chunk at the end of a disk :)
2008-07-11T03:26:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Swish	That sounds like a really bad, bad idea.
2008-07-11T03:26:00.000Z	Swish	ArthurArchnix	why so?  it would make future writes quicker
