2004-11-28T14:52:00.000Z	luc1f3r		someone want to help me?
2004-11-28T14:52:00.000Z	luc1f3r		I'm trying to install an NVIDIA driver...
2004-11-28T14:52:00.000Z	luc1f3r		any suggestions?
2004-11-28T14:53:00.000Z	luc1f3r		I ran /etc/init.d/gdm stop
2004-11-28T14:53:00.000Z	luc1f3r		and it took me out of gdm, i guess
2004-11-28T14:53:00.000Z	luc1f3r		that didn't help at all
2004-11-28T14:53:00.000Z	luc1f3r		basically, it says i need to exit the "X server"
2004-11-28T14:53:00.000Z	luc1f3r		and i can't figure out how...
2004-11-28T14:53:00.000Z	scoon	luc1f3r	are you trying to install the nvidia drivers from nvidia's site ?
2004-11-28T14:53:00.000Z	luc1f3r		yeah
2004-11-28T14:54:00.000Z	scoon	luc1f3r	make certain that you stop gdm, and be certain that nv module is unloaded
2004-11-28T14:54:00.000Z	scoon	luc1f3r	did you try to install the deb first ?
2004-11-28T14:55:00.000Z	luc1f3r	scoon	i don't know what the "deb" is, I tried instaling w/ "terminal"
2004-11-28T14:55:00.000Z	scoon	luc1f3r	sorry.  did you try to install it from apt first ?
2004-11-28T14:56:00.000Z	luc1f3r	scoon	i'm sorry, almost everything sounds like giberish to me, what is "apt"?
2004-11-28T14:56:00.000Z	scoon	luc1f3r	nevermind.
2004-11-28T14:57:00.000Z	luc1f3r		okay
