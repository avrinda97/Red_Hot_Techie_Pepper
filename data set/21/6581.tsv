2007-03-06T06:45:00.000Z	Kronuz		what packet manager?
2007-03-06T06:46:00.000Z	Kronuz		hey, does the LiveCD come with a IRC client?
2007-03-06T06:48:00.000Z	Kronuz		I'm really new and I wouldn't want to f*#k things up, could someone help me when I get back here in my LiveCD :)
2007-03-06T06:48:00.000Z	Kronuz		just that RAID part
2007-03-06T06:49:00.000Z	Kronuz		the howto seems too complicated in some parts, I'm really not very familiar with Ubuntu, not to mention Linux
2007-03-06T06:51:00.000Z	Kronuz		okay, I'll be back in my LiveCD... hopefully, and hopefully someone can help me if I get stuck
2007-03-06T06:51:00.000Z	Kronuz		hey, also... what do you use as a download manager? I use FlashGet in windows
2007-03-06T06:52:00.000Z	Kronuz		(just figuring out what apps I'll want, to have equivalent functionality in Linux as I have in windows)
2007-03-06T06:53:00.000Z	Kronuz		like for instance, I also use TortoiseSVN and CVS
2007-03-06T06:53:00.000Z	Kronuz		I dont' know if there's something similar for Linux
2007-03-06T06:55:00.000Z	dgx	Kronuz	I used Xchat for a while, but Gaim has proved to be better in my opinion...
2007-03-06T06:55:00.000Z	Kronuz	dgx	isn't it Gaim the one with MSN Messenger support too?
2007-03-06T06:57:00.000Z	dgx	Kronuz	What do you want to use IRC for? I assume if you've switched from Winbl0ws you won't be jumping into scripting too soon..
2007-03-06T06:57:00.000Z	Kronuz	dgx	nah, just to start asking questions here and there about linux, if I have to
2007-03-06T06:58:00.000Z	dgx	Kronuz	Then Gaim is best :) Simple client with a decent interface.
2007-03-06T06:58:00.000Z	Kronuz	dgx	and it's installed in the LiveCD?
2007-03-06T06:59:00.000Z	dgx	Kronuz	It's installed, yeap.
2007-03-06T06:59:00.000Z	dgx	Kronuz	Why not resize a partition and install on HDD? Much faster.
2007-03-06T06:59:00.000Z	Kronuz	dgx	I will, but I have RAID arrays :P
2007-03-06T07:02:00.000Z	dgx	Kronuz	Same :) Gave gaming up a year or so ago, and Ubuntu has proven to serve me much better than Windows so far.
2007-03-06T07:02:00.000Z	dgx	Kronuz	have fun :)
