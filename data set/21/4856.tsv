2008-04-15T10:11:00.000Z	unop_	shishirmk	http://releases.ubuntu.com/releases/8.04/
2008-04-15T10:14:00.000Z	unop_	shishirmk	look properly, it's there in a file called MD5SUMS
2008-04-15T10:14:00.000Z	unop_	shishirmk	you didn't see properly - http://releases.ubuntu.com/releases/8.04/MD5SUMS
2008-04-15T10:15:00.000Z	unop_	shishirmk	did you download the desktop or alternate version?
2008-04-15T10:15:00.000Z	shishirmk	unop_	what to do if they dont match ?? download once again??
2008-04-15T10:16:00.000Z	unop_	shishirmk	umm yea, but first, do you remember which mirror exactly you downloaded the image off?
2008-04-15T10:16:00.000Z	unop_	shishirmk	hmm, do you still have the link?
2008-04-15T10:16:00.000Z	shishirmk	unop_	ya japan
2008-04-15T10:17:00.000Z	shishirmk	unop_	i have the link does it avoid redownlaoding?
2008-04-15T10:18:00.000Z	unop_	shishirmk	let's have a look, post the link
2008-04-15T10:20:00.000Z	unop_	shishirmk	doesn't look good - the md5sum on this mirror doesn't match up either - http://ftp.jaist.ac.jp/pub/Linux/ubuntu-releases/8.04/MD5SUMS
2008-04-15T10:21:00.000Z	shishirmk	unop_	what do you suggest i should do
2008-04-15T10:21:00.000Z	unop_	shishirmk	you'll need to redownload yes . i don't think there's anyway to have a resume download - so it needs to be done from the beginning.
2008-04-15T10:21:00.000Z	unop_	shishirmk	if you are capable with debian or ubuntu, i suggest you download the network/minimal CD .. install the base system and then install other packages from the internet using apt-get, etc
2008-04-15T10:23:00.000Z	shishirmk	unop_	too bad i have a 256kbps connection and it takes whole night
2008-04-15T10:23:00.000Z	shishirmk	unop_	thanks anywya
2008-04-15T10:23:00.000Z	unop_	shishirmk	hmm, i dunno if you would be interested in the minimal CD tho
2008-04-15T10:24:00.000Z	unop_	shishirmk	or network CD even, only ~10mb .. but requires you know your way around the debian/ubuntu command line
2008-04-15T10:24:00.000Z	shishirmk	unop_	well i wanted a proper cd to give it to my frns
2008-04-15T10:25:00.000Z	shishirmk	unop_	i could have managed somehow with the network cd
