2009-05-14T09:56:00.000Z	Piet	mogus	boabab
2009-05-14T09:56:00.000Z	Piet		baobab even
2009-05-14T09:56:00.000Z	mogus		Piet:thanks!
2009-05-14T09:57:00.000Z	mogus	Piet	Is there a foldersize-like plugin for Gnome?
2009-05-14T09:59:00.000Z	Piet	mogus	there are extensions for nautilus, but i don't know whether there is one to display the total size of directories and their children in a list.
2009-05-14T09:59:00.000Z	mogus	Piet	in addition to fsview (KDE) i found a neat ncurses frontend for du (du -h) called ncdu
2009-05-14T09:59:00.000Z	mogus	Piet	thanks
2009-05-14T09:59:00.000Z	Piet	mogus	if i need this information i usually right-click a directory and select properties or use du -sch on a terminal
2009-05-14T10:00:00.000Z	mogus	Piet	Yes, but thats so... Microsoft. I imagine Ubuntu/Debian/Linux can do better :)
2009-05-14T10:02:00.000Z	mogus	Piet	I usually use df -h for the basic overall drive usage - nice and quick
2009-05-14T10:02:00.000Z	mogus		du -sch works nicely to get a general summary
2009-05-14T10:03:00.000Z	mogus	Piet	thanks

2009-05-14T10:05:00.000Z	mogus	Piet	Baobab is indeed nice. Trick apparently is to use the "Folder" view to look at mounted drives.
2009-05-14T10:08:00.000Z	mogus	Piet	the devs apparently think that basic info like calculating the size of a folder is "intrusive".
2009-05-14T10:09:00.000Z	mogus	Piet	basic functionality that should appear in the file manager folder detail size pane IMHO
2009-05-14T10:09:00.000Z	Piet	mogus	the problem is it slows the file manager down remarkably and causes lots of I/O
2009-05-14T10:11:00.000Z	mogus	Piet	not if they do it right, as foldersize does, which is calculate in the background. File sizes don't change every second, and in any case people aren't looking usally for exact data, just the 'which of my folders do i need to move to my backup drive before my system drive gets maxed out,' sort of thing
2009-05-14T10:12:00.000Z	mogus	Piet	AFAIK size is calculated with most current file systems, and reading is just a matter of keeping a cache current with what is being written
2009-05-14T10:12:00.000Z	Piet	mogus	yeah i guess youre right there
