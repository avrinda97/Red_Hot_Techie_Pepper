2008-06-21T01:05:00.000Z	ipod_touch		Can you just use an external hard drive?
2008-06-21T01:07:00.000Z	ipod_touch		hmm, what file system does your HDD have?
2008-06-21T01:07:00.000Z	ipod_touch		NTFS?
2008-06-21T01:07:00.000Z	ipod_touch		FAT32?
2008-06-21T01:07:00.000Z	ashgarg	ipod_touch	im not sure hwat file system my External HDD has, let me take a look
2008-06-21T01:10:00.000Z	ashgarg	ipod_touch	there's no /host/ folder - or maybe im just missing it
2008-06-21T01:13:00.000Z	ashgarg	ipod_touch	Ubuntu is installed on a Macintosh, yes
2008-06-21T01:13:00.000Z	ashgarg	ipod_touch	it's not through parallels, its native
2008-06-21T01:16:00.000Z	ipod_touch	ashgarg	see if you can find the right partition where your mac files are
2008-06-21T01:17:00.000Z	ashgarg	ipod_touch	i cant actually find a /host/ directory
2008-06-21T01:19:00.000Z	ipod_touch	ashgarg	goto the places menu on the menu bar
2008-06-21T01:20:00.000Z	ashgarg	ipod_touch	doing that right now
2008-06-21T01:20:00.000Z	ashgarg	ipod_touch	i clicked places, and there's only "Computer", "CD/DVD Creator" and "Lacie 120 GB" which is the external
2008-06-21T01:23:00.000Z	ipod_touch	ashgarg	do you think maybe the Lacie 120 GB isn't compatible with the Mac?
2008-06-21T01:23:00.000Z	ashgarg	ipod_touch	it can copy files to and from the mac very easily, so i dont see why not
2008-06-21T01:24:00.000Z	ashgarg	ipod_touch	rebooted the mac loads of times, it just doesnt work
2008-06-21T01:28:00.000Z	ipod_touch	ashgarg	sometimes with my HDD or flash drive, if it doesn't come up on a particular computer or linux, what i do is goto another pc and safely eject the device, then goto linux or the other pc and try again, and it usually works
2008-06-21T01:29:00.000Z	ashgarg	ipod_touch	okay i'll try that. it's working successfully with linux, so if i safely eject it from here and then reboot into the mac it may work?
2008-06-21T01:31:00.000Z	ipod_touch	ashgarg	did it work at all?
2008-06-21T01:34:00.000Z	ashgarg	ipod_touch	you too, thanks a lot - loads of help
2008-06-21T01:35:00.000Z	ashgarg	ipod_touch	i havent tried that yet, will do so soon..
