2006-10-28T13:40:00.000Z	newbie001		hello... I'm have the following problem: my generic kernel (or my old 686 kernel I used in dapper) doesn't boot
2006-10-28T13:40:00.000Z	newbie001		I am using a 386 kernel at the moment
2006-10-28T13:41:00.000Z	chuckyp	newbie001	use linux-image-generic
2006-10-28T13:42:00.000Z	newbie001	chuckyp	that's what I have installed
2006-10-28T13:42:00.000Z	chuckyp	newbie001	k
2006-10-28T13:42:00.000Z	newbie001	chuckyp	I'm using 2.6.17-10 generic
2006-10-28T13:42:00.000Z	chuckyp	newbie001	k whats the problem?
2006-10-28T13:43:00.000Z	chuckyp	newbie001	what sort of issues are you having?
2006-10-28T13:45:00.000Z	chuckyp	newbie001	What problems are you having exactly?
2006-10-28T13:45:00.000Z	chuckyp	newbie001	sudo apt-get install usplash-theme-ubuntu
2006-10-28T13:45:00.000Z	newbie001	chuckyp	let me see
2006-10-28T13:45:00.000Z	chuckyp	newbie001	also make sure you have the ubuntu-desktop meta package.
2006-10-28T13:46:00.000Z	newbie001	chuckyp	omg...
2006-10-28T13:48:00.000Z	newbie001	chuckyp	I think this is not a problem with usplash... it seems as if the hd wasn't accesible when trying to boot a generic (since 386 finds the splash and the archive mdadm.conf)
2006-10-28T13:48:00.000Z	chuckyp	newbie001	k dunno then.
2006-10-28T13:56:00.000Z	chuckyp	newbie001	dmesg
2006-10-28T13:56:00.000Z	chuckyp	newbie001	/var/log/dmesg
2006-10-28T13:58:00.000Z	newbie001	chuckyp	the only logs I have are those from the 386 boots... the generic boots didn't get logged
2006-10-28T13:59:00.000Z	newbie001	chuckyp	by the way... if I use recovery mode the system stops at "Waiting for root filesystem"
2006-10-28T13:59:00.000Z	chuckyp	newbie001	how did this problem start?
2006-10-28T14:00:00.000Z	newbie001	chuckyp	I updated to edgy
