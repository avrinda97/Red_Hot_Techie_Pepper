2011-02-13T08:05:00.000Z	Starminn	BiPolah	Mine's i686 and 32-bit
2011-02-13T08:06:00.000Z	BiPolah	Starminn	All the .iso's I've downloaded were i386
2011-02-13T08:07:00.000Z	Starminn	BiPolah	$ uname -a (gives me this:) Linux robert-Dell-DME510 2.6.35-25-generic-pae #44-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jan 21 19:01:46 UTC 2011 i686 GNU/Linux
2011-02-13T08:08:00.000Z	BiPolah	Starminn	Linux ABarbour-Ubuntu 2.6.35-25-generic #44-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jan 21 17:40:48 UTC 2011 i686 GNU/Linux
2011-02-13T08:08:00.000Z	Starminn	BiPolah	Why or how, I don't know, but all I know is I see an i686 in there. Beyond that, you've got me. :)
2011-02-13T08:08:00.000Z	BiPolah	Starminn	The iso I've got is 386, how quaint. What's the -pae thing after generic on yours?
2011-02-13T08:09:00.000Z	Starminn	BiPolah	Physical Address Extension. It's used for addressing more than 4GB of physical RAM
2011-02-13T08:09:00.000Z	Starminn	BiPolah	Oh, ubottu's got you
2011-02-13T08:09:00.000Z	BiPolah	Starminn	Oh right, that.
2011-02-13T08:53:00.000Z	BiPolah	Starminn	Ah, okay, I'll have a fiddle with it
2011-02-13T08:51:00.000Z	Starminn	BiPolah	CTRL+ALT+<left or right arrow key>
2011-02-13T08:51:00.000Z	Starminn	BiPolah	The dock I have now (Avant) has a thing that shows workspaces as well if you'd prefer a dock, perhaps.
2011-02-13T08:52:00.000Z	BiPolah	Starminn	I know that I can switch using those, it just doesn't work if I don't have the applet on a panel.
2011-02-13T08:52:00.000Z	Starminn	BiPolah	Oh. Well I use Avant. and it works. Never tried without either. Sorry. :(
2011-02-13T08:54:00.000Z	Starminn	BiPolah	I killed my dock and removed the workspace switcher on panel, it works for me.
2011-02-13T08:54:00.000Z	Starminn	BiPolah	Could also be because I have Compiz, though.
2011-02-13T08:54:00.000Z	BiPolah	Starminn	I removed it and re-added it, it works now. Just a random problem before then
2011-02-13T08:54:00.000Z	Starminn	BiPolah	Glad to hear.
2011-02-16T02:37:00.000Z	Starminn	BiPolah	Have you tried deleting the files from ~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files
2011-02-16T02:38:00.000Z	BiPolah	Starminn	I'm not sute that would work, would probably leave references in WINE. Notepad itself is in the Windows folder. I actually just want to stop it from showing up when I want to open a text file
2011-02-16T02:40:00.000Z	Starminn	BiPolah	Ah, alright. Not so sure then -- probably some file that control context menus somewhere that I don't know about. I do know, though, that when you delete files from the ~/.wine/drice_c/Program Files that they have a tendency to still show up in the WINE menu under Applications->Wine so as far as 100% getting rid of them I'm not sure. I'd say there's somewhere you can edit the context menus for the files that offer to open in
