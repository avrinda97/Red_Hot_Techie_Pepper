2009-07-02T13:46:00.000Z	Stdht		Could someone please help me
2009-07-02T13:46:00.000Z	Stdht		I have in sound devices HDA intel alc268 (ALSA) , HDA intel analog alc268 (OSS),HDA intel analog alc268 (OSS), Alsa advanced linux sound architecture, OSS open sound system, PulsaeAudioServer
2009-07-02T13:46:00.000Z	Stdht		why so many devices/// comparing to windows
2009-07-02T13:46:00.000Z	ziroday	Stdht	ALSA and OSS are different soundsystems. I recommend you pick the first option
2009-07-02T13:48:00.000Z	ziroday	Stdht	please don't PM. ALSA and OSS are both soundsystems and are seperate from each other. You should pick ALSA
2009-07-02T13:48:00.000Z	Stdht	ziroday	ok
2009-07-02T13:49:00.000Z	Stdht	ziroday	so I have both installed,
2009-07-02T13:49:00.000Z	ziroday	Stdht	it would appear so but I'm not certain
2009-07-02T13:50:00.000Z	Stdht	ziroday	I can test all of them but only HDA Intel(alc268) do not work
2009-07-02T13:50:00.000Z	ziroday	Stdht	okay, well then use the one that works then
2009-07-02T13:51:00.000Z	Stdht	ziroday	so I do but why there so many devices comparing to windows
2009-07-02T13:52:00.000Z	ziroday	Stdht	because of the different sound systems, windows only has one sound system (AFAIK)
2009-07-02T13:53:00.000Z	Stdht	ziroday	so How to choose which device will soundplayer use?
2009-07-02T13:54:00.000Z	Stdht	ziroday	I cant test ALSA on HDA intel and at the same time when I play wav file with a pleyer I can use HDA intel ALSA in volume contorl and voulme really changes?
2009-07-02T13:54:00.000Z	ziroday	Stdht	I have no idea what you are saying sorry.
2009-07-02T13:55:00.000Z	Stdht	ziroday	my english needs much to be regarded ... but I'll try once again...:)
2009-07-02T13:55:00.000Z	ziroday	Stdht	what's your native language?
2009-07-02T13:56:00.000Z	Stdht	ziroday	russian
2009-07-02T13:56:00.000Z	ziroday	Stdht	then #ubuntu-ru might be helpful too :)
2009-07-02T14:13:00.000Z	Stdht	ziroday	as i thought in russian channel - no help at all
2009-07-02T14:14:00.000Z	Stdht	ziroday	so may I ask you once again?
