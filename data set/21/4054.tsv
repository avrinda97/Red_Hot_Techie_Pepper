2011-03-03T20:16:00.000Z	ibrahim_		hi, i used to have a sound problem and it was fixed by installing linux-alsa-driver-modules-$(uname -r) then after few weeks by get updates of the update manager the sound vanished "nothing is muted" how can i fix this problem ?
2011-03-03T20:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ibrahim_	what is the output of: wget -O alsa-info.sh http://alsa-project.org/alsa-info.sh && bash ./alsa-info.sh       thanks
2011-03-03T20:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ibrahim_	you need that script and run it, you can access it via web browser and copy to a text file to be ran instead
2011-03-03T20:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ibrahim_	run:  gedit ~/alsa-info; bash ./alsa-info         paste in this text: http://git.alsa-project.org/?p=alsa-driver.git;a=blob_plain;f=utils/alsa-info.sh
2011-03-03T20:40:00.000Z	ibrahim_	ActionParsnip	then....
2011-03-03T20:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ibrahim_	save the file and close gedit
2011-03-03T20:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ibrahim_	then upload to the site and give the red URL generated
2011-03-03T20:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ibrahim_	the script uploads to the alsa site, it makes the link for you

2011-03-03T20:54:00.000Z	ibrahim_	ActionParsnip	: http://paste.ubuntu.com/575035/
2011-03-03T20:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ibrahim_	thats the script, run it and you will make a link
2011-03-03T20:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ibrahim_	the command I gave is all you needed. The one which opened gedit. All you had to do was copy the script and paste to gedit and save then close it. The script will then run
