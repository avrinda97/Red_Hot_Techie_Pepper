2005-04-16T07:40:00.000Z	marska		Hello.. I am trying to mount a USB CDRW/DVD drive with no success. The /scd0 mount point doesn't seem to work (it is binded to /cdrom as it was the default drive) and it is odd, as when I insert a music CD, it detects it, but cannot play the music itself. How can I get it to work?
2005-04-16T07:42:00.000Z	marska		How idea about the CDRW/DVD drive?

2005-04-16T07:46:00.000Z	marska		So I guess thats a no?
2005-04-16T07:47:00.000Z	marska		No one here has ever mounted a USB CD-ROM through Linux?
2005-04-16T07:48:00.000Z	whiskers	marska	well i mount a usb hard drive through linux....should be similar to cd
2005-04-16T07:49:00.000Z	whiskers	marska	well i do a dmesg to find out what the usb assignment is when i plug the hard drive in..
2005-04-16T07:52:00.000Z	whiskers	marska	yes do you see the info in dmesg after the kernel picks up the cd
2005-04-17T08:47:00.000Z	whiskers	marska	sounds like you misspelled something in your mount command
2005-04-17T08:53:00.000Z	marska	whiskers	No. I typed it correctly.
2005-04-17T08:54:00.000Z	whiskers	marska	ok what does dmesg say is it still using /dev/sr)
2005-04-17T08:55:00.000Z	whiskers	marska	ok and you have a cd in it and you typed mount -t iso9660 /dev/sr0 /media/usbcdrom
2005-04-17T08:55:00.000Z	whiskers	marska	are all characters lower case
2005-04-17T08:57:00.000Z	marska	whiskers	In my command?
2005-04-17T08:57:00.000Z	whiskers	marska	ok forget the mount...there is a more basic problem
2005-04-17T08:58:00.000Z	whiskers	marska	try unplugging the usb and plugging in again and read dmesg again
2005-04-17T08:59:00.000Z	whiskers	marska	you need to get a clear message from dmesg before bothering with mount
2005-04-17T08:59:00.000Z	marska	whiskers	The second message is the error I get when I try to point it.
2005-04-17T09:00:00.000Z	whiskers	marska	ok what does the dmesg section say
2005-04-17T09:00:00.000Z	whiskers	marska	is it giving you i/o errors
2005-04-17T09:02:00.000Z	whiskers	marska	well the kernel picked it up ok...so try another known good cd
