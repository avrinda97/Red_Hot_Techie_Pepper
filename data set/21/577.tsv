2011-09-21T23:56:00.000Z	PyDon		hi
2011-09-21T23:56:00.000Z	PyDon		me too :)
2011-09-21T23:56:00.000Z	PyDon		can anyone help me? how many bytes are 1 Kilobyte on CentOS?
2011-09-21T23:56:00.000Z	PyDon		or on Ubuntu
2011-09-21T23:57:00.000Z	PyDon		so what value exactly?
2011-09-21T23:57:00.000Z	PyDon		i know windows fails here
2011-09-21T23:58:00.000Z	iceroot	PyDon	its always the same, the only problem is that some programs are showing KByte but mean KiByte
2011-09-21T23:59:00.000Z	PyDon	iceroot	yes..
2011-09-21T23:59:00.000Z	PyDon		how would you handle this platform independent?
2011-09-21T23:59:00.000Z	iceroot	PyDon	just use the standard
2011-09-21T23:59:00.000Z	iceroot	PyDon	thats a reason a standard exist
2011-09-22T00:00:00.000Z	iceroot	PyDon	but a file is not bigger on linux than on windows or the other way (but there are differences when using different filesystems)
2011-09-22T00:00:00.000Z	PyDon		sure...
2011-09-22T00:00:00.000Z	iceroot	PyDon	or different block-sizes
2011-09-22T00:00:00.000Z	PyDon		yeap
2011-09-22T00:01:00.000Z	PyDon		I just wonder if I display the amount of used memory on windows and Linux
2011-09-22T00:01:00.000Z	PyDon		the windows app show the same as linux, but on both systems the mean something diffferent
2011-09-22T00:02:00.000Z	PyDon		so if there is " 3.5 GB" in memory.. the most people might think that their computer runs out of memory
2011-09-22T00:02:00.000Z	PyDon		even there are real 500 MB left
2011-09-22T00:02:00.000Z	iceroot		!ram | PyDon
2011-09-22T00:03:00.000Z	PyDon	iceroot	yes, for sure, i Know
