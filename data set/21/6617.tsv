2009-02-14T13:07:00.000Z	FluxD		Anyone know what happened to current session tab in sessions in intrepid?
2009-02-14T13:09:00.000Z	crdlb	FluxD	because it was old and crufty. the fundamentals of the new gnome-session are very sound, but it's also very half-baked in intrepid
2009-02-14T13:08:00.000Z	crdlb	FluxD	gnome-session was rewritten
2009-02-14T13:09:00.000Z	FluxD	crdlb	how come?
2009-02-14T13:11:00.000Z	FluxD	crdlb	I am trying to stop gnome panel from starting up in sessions, but I dont see an entry, do you where it could be ?
2009-02-14T13:11:00.000Z	crdlb	FluxD	hrm, that's a good question
2009-02-14T13:17:00.000Z	crdlb	FluxD	found it, in gconf of course :)
2009-02-14T13:17:00.000Z	FluxD	crdlb	ah lol nice
2009-02-14T13:18:00.000Z	crdlb	FluxD	gconf-editor /desktop/gnome/session (remove panel from required_components list)
2009-02-14T13:19:00.000Z	crdlb	FluxD	don't thank me, thank google; I'd never have figured that out on my own :)
2009-02-14T13:20:00.000Z	FluxD	crdlb	okay google it is then :)
2009-02-14T13:40:00.000Z	FluxD	crdlb	how do u delete the key in it? I dont see a remove key option
2009-02-14T14:00:00.000Z	crdlb	FluxD	don't delete the key, remove the entry from the list
2009-02-14T14:01:00.000Z	FluxD	crdlb	what entry ? panel ?
2009-02-14T14:01:00.000Z	crdlb	FluxD	yes
2009-02-14T14:01:00.000Z	FluxD	crdlb	how? I dont see an option or do I make it empty ?
2009-02-14T14:02:00.000Z	crdlb	FluxD	double-click, select panel, remove, OK
2009-02-14T14:06:00.000Z	FluxD	crdlb	double click required_components ?
2009-02-14T14:07:00.000Z	crdlb	FluxD	ah, you're looking at the wrong thing, don't go into the required_components folder
2009-02-14T14:07:00.000Z	FluxD	crdlb	ah I found it thanks
2009-02-14T14:07:00.000Z	crdlb	FluxD	there's a string list key called required_components_list inside of /desktop/gnome/session
