2006-09-19T13:19:00.000Z	cafuego	rene32	No, it doesn't.
2006-09-19T13:19:00.000Z	rene32	cafuego	100% sure?
2006-09-19T13:19:00.000Z	cafuego	rene32	Yes.
2006-09-19T13:19:00.000Z	cafuego	rene32	It's an orinoco silver/gold card, right?
2006-09-19T13:19:00.000Z	rene32	cafuego	I have read so many manuals and some of them mention Prism 2.5 as supported chipset for WPA
2006-09-19T13:20:00.000Z	rene32	cafuego	network-manager-gnome uses the orinoco driver. More I don't know.
2006-09-19T13:20:00.000Z	rene32	cafuego	Built in (mini PCI?) card.
2006-09-19T13:20:00.000Z	cafuego	rene32	Yeah, 99% sure you won't get WPA on that.
2006-09-19T13:21:00.000Z	rene32	cafuego	Why are you so sure?
2006-09-19T13:21:00.000Z	cafuego	rene32	My prisms don't do wpa :-)
2006-09-19T13:22:00.000Z	rene32	cafuego	So what do you say about this? http://remote-exploit.org/index.php/Prism_update
2006-09-19T13:23:00.000Z	cafuego	rene32	These days, atheros probably... or maybe centrino (2100/2200)
2006-09-19T13:24:00.000Z	cafuego	rene32	Hold on, does your prism2.5 does 802.11g?
2006-09-19T13:24:00.000Z	rene32	cafuego	No, only 11mbps
2006-09-19T13:24:00.000Z	cafuego	rene32	No WPA then.
2006-09-19T13:24:00.000Z	rene32	cafuego	But the windows driver was crap. So that does not say anything :-)
2006-09-19T13:25:00.000Z	rene32	cafuego	Ok, so I'll take this for sure then and see if this notebook has a replacable miniPCI card built in.
2006-09-19T13:25:00.000Z	cafuego	rene32	wpa is part of the 802.11g standard, not 802.11b. That only does WEP (64 and 128bit - and the latter only on newer cards)
2006-09-19T13:26:00.000Z	rene32	cafuego	ok, seems to make sense. So I can give up trying to get wpa_supplicant work.
2006-09-19T13:26:00.000Z	rene32	cafuego	thx alot
2006-09-19T13:26:00.000Z	cafuego	rene32	np
