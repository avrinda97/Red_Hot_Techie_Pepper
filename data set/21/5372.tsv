2007-11-02T00:25:00.000Z	Rhino_Ak		I'm trying to admin a debian server
2007-11-02T00:26:00.000Z	Rhino_Ak		and I'm need some help as to where to start
2007-11-02T00:26:00.000Z	Rhino_Ak		Disk critical with 164 mb free
2007-11-02T00:26:00.000Z	Rhino_Ak		where do I start
2007-11-02T00:28:00.000Z	Vlet	Rhino_Ak	Well, that question is a bit vague... what do you want to do? Delete things, add more drive space, copy things elsewhere?... Why not ask the #debian people too, since it's debian
2007-11-02T00:29:00.000Z	Rhino_Ak	Vlet	Move things around, but I need to know what partition is running low
2007-11-02T00:30:00.000Z	Rhino_Ak		what's my first step in troubleshooting this issue.
2007-11-02T00:30:00.000Z	Rhino_Ak		I'm very new to linux
2007-11-02T00:30:00.000Z	Vlet	Rhino_Ak	use "df -h"
2007-11-02T00:30:00.000Z	Rhino_Ak	Vlet	did that
2007-11-02T00:31:00.000Z	Vlet	Rhino_Ak	okay, well that shows you what you said you wanted to know
2007-11-02T00:32:00.000Z	Rhino_Ak	Vlet	it looks like /usr 271m are free on a 3gb partition
2007-11-02T00:33:00.000Z	Vlet	Rhino_Ak	I'm not sure what you're asking of me/us...
2007-11-02T00:34:00.000Z	Rhino_Ak	Vlet	I'm getting a clear sense I what to do now
2007-11-02T00:34:00.000Z	Rhino_Ak		thanks for your help
2007-11-02T00:35:00.000Z	Vlet	Rhino_Ak	okay... I'm sorry - I'm not trying to be snooty... It's just hard to help without specific-ish questions
2007-11-02T00:35:00.000Z	Rhino_Ak	Vlet	I didn't take it that way....
2007-11-02T00:36:00.000Z	Rhino_Ak		linux is a fun os but for a visual guy like myself its hard to know where to start and where to go next
2007-11-02T00:40:00.000Z	Rhino_Ak	Vlet	here's what I have
2007-11-02T00:41:00.000Z	Rhino_Ak		/usr = avail/used = 3.5/3.1
2007-11-02T00:43:00.000Z	Vlet	Rhino_Ak	I understand, but I don't know what you want me to tell you how to do
