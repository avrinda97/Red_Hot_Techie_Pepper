2009-05-09T17:01:00.000Z	iceroot		is there an advantage using find instead of locate?
2009-05-09T17:02:00.000Z	jimlovell777	iceroot	It probably depends on what you want out of the two.
2010-03-04T19:00:00.000Z	jimlovell777	iceroot	Better?
2010-03-04T19:09:00.000Z	iceroot	jimlovell777	much better :)
2010-03-04T19:10:00.000Z	jimlovell777	iceroot	:)
2011-02-08T00:32:00.000Z	iceroot	jimlovell777	iowait
2011-02-08T00:33:00.000Z	iceroot	jimlovell777	in "top" the value for "wa" should be very high
2011-02-08T00:35:00.000Z	jimlovell777	iceroot	47.6%wa
2011-02-08T00:36:00.000Z	iceroot	jimlovell777	so the cpu is waiting 50% of the whole time for the hard drive and is doing nothing instead of waiting
2011-02-08T00:38:00.000Z	jimlovell777	iceroot	This displeases me. lol. I don't understand though, seems like there shouldn't be a slowdown, I understand the OS having to wait for the HD to catch up but why choke the system in the meantime? What fundamental concept am I missing?
2011-02-08T00:39:00.000Z	iceroot	jimlovell777	the os cant do any furhter steps if the informations are missing and the informations are coming from the harddrive
2011-02-08T00:40:00.000Z	iceroot	jimlovell777	you can use "ionice" to reduce the priority of the process, so the scheduler can give more cpu time to other processes
2011-02-08T00:40:00.000Z	jimlovell777	iceroot	Ah, just clicked. If it's busy transferring data the OS is stalled waiting to load code it needs to run? Half accurate?
2011-02-08T00:40:00.000Z	iceroot	jimlovell777	its not directly the code of the os
2011-02-08T00:41:00.000Z	jimlovell777	iceroot	Right but code for Firefox, Totem, etc.?
2011-02-08T00:42:00.000Z	iceroot	jimlovell777	no. if you tell your system to copy 50GB to another pc and the prioritiy is normal and you have another process running e.g. watching a video on youtube and the prio is also normal, then both processes are at the same prioritylevel for the scheduler. your harddrive isnt fast enought but the scheduler is giving the process 50% of the time, the other 50% goes to your flash,video
2011-02-08T00:43:00.000Z	iceroot	jimlovell777	it doesnt matter if your system can copy 1MB/s or 100MB/s, the scheduler is giving 50% of the cpu-time to the copy-process
2011-02-08T00:44:00.000Z	iceroot	jimlovell777	and most of the 50% are waitint-time for the harddrive (in top its called (wa)it)
2011-02-08T00:44:00.000Z	jimlovell777	iceroot	Ah, ok. Makes sense. I knew I was missing something, just didn't know what it was.
2011-02-08T00:44:00.000Z	iceroot	jimlovell777	have a look at "man ionice"
2011-02-08T00:44:00.000Z	iceroot	jimlovell777	very usefull for that kind of "problem"
