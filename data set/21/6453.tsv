2007-03-29T11:54:00.000Z	noobie0057	newlaptop	I am
2007-03-29T11:54:00.000Z	noobie0057	newlaptop	I'm really starting to hate it
2007-03-29T11:54:00.000Z	newlaptop	noobie0057	what's it doing / not doing?
2007-03-29T11:55:00.000Z	noobie0057	newlaptop	not installing, mythtv-setup tells me it cannot connect to the database
2007-03-29T11:55:00.000Z	newlaptop		ok
2007-03-29T11:55:00.000Z	newlaptop	noobie0057	frontend and backend on different machines?
2007-03-29T11:55:00.000Z	newlaptop	noobie0057	or all on one box?
2007-03-29T11:56:00.000Z	noobie0057	newlaptop	one machine
2007-03-29T11:56:00.000Z	noobie0057	newlaptop	it's an amd64 with 3 tuner cards
2007-03-29T11:56:00.000Z	newlaptop	noobie0057	hmm... mysqld is running, correct?
2007-03-29T11:58:00.000Z	noobie0057	newlaptop	I don't know, it should be, when I type mysqld I get warnings an a message saying it will shut down,, looks like this is the problem
2007-03-29T11:58:00.000Z	newlaptop		what is in the logs for mysqld?  does the process die, or just give warnings?
2007-03-29T11:59:00.000Z	noobie0057	newlaptop	when I try to log into mysql using root I get Access denied,, I just installed it, I'm sure the password is correct
2007-03-29T11:59:00.000Z	noobie0057	newlaptop	I am not familiar with the logs
2007-03-29T12:00:00.000Z	newlaptop	noobie0057	if you get access denied when trying to log in with root, you'll have to reset the passwords, most likely
2007-03-29T12:01:00.000Z	noobie0057	newlaptop	thanks, I can't get it changed, either, I'm going to reinstall  it
2007-03-29T12:02:00.000Z	newlaptop	noobie0057	one sec
2007-03-29T12:02:00.000Z	newlaptop		was googling
2007-03-29T12:04:00.000Z	newlaptop	noobie0057	http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/resetting-permissions.html
2007-03-29T12:07:00.000Z	noobie0057	newlaptop	thanks, I'm in.  There in not a mythtv user in mysql. Do you think I should create one?
2007-03-29T12:11:00.000Z	newlaptop	noobie0057	good that it worked for you.  I would create a seperate id for mythtv.  reserve the root account for when something is hosed
