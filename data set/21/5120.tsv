2007-12-25T23:26:00.000Z	fraterm		well, sound recording is rather frustratingly broken with gnome.
2007-12-25T23:27:00.000Z	fraterm		gstreamer is kind of making me frown.
2007-12-25T23:27:00.000Z	fraterm		what with it hanging hither and yon.
2007-12-25T23:29:00.000Z	SyntaxError55	fraterm	:| I don't know if it'll work much better
2007-12-25T23:29:00.000Z	fraterm	SyntaxError55	I'm just wanting to be able to record off of my mic
2007-12-25T23:30:00.000Z	SyntaxError55	fraterm	I think KMix does tha.
2007-12-25T23:31:00.000Z	SyntaxError55	fraterm	I think you can sudo apt-get kmix without getting the whole kubuntu-desktop
2007-12-25T23:31:00.000Z	fraterm	SyntaxError55	I've got the room
2007-12-25T23:31:00.000Z	SyntaxError55	fraterm	then go for it :D I prefer KDE honestly
2007-12-25T23:32:00.000Z	SyntaxError55	fraterm	AMD 64? :|
2007-12-25T23:33:00.000Z	fraterm	SyntaxError55	there's a known upstream buglet, that apparently will be fixed sometime never.
2007-12-25T23:36:00.000Z	SyntaxError55	fraterm	lol "sometime never". That's how it usually goes with things that aren't in high demand (such as, I still run dapper, and most of the time I have to compile updates to apps, like inkscape)
2007-12-25T23:37:00.000Z	fraterm	SyntaxError55	is your box sensibly running a 32 bit distro?
2007-12-25T23:37:00.000Z	SyntaxError55	fraterm	yes.
2007-12-25T23:38:00.000Z	SyntaxError55	fraterm	lol. from what I know, there's really no reason to have Linux on AMD64 since there aren't really that many linux games.
2007-12-25T23:38:00.000Z	fraterm	SyntaxError55	most of the games are 32 bit anyway.
2007-12-25T23:40:00.000Z	SyntaxError55	fraterm	are you trying KMix/Kubuntu-desktop?
2007-12-25T23:40:00.000Z	fraterm	SyntaxError55	I will be... it's setting up in a terminal now.
2007-12-25T23:40:00.000Z	SyntaxError55	fraterm	ok :)
