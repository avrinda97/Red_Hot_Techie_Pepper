2009-03-04T07:35:00.000Z	hmw	D3RGPS31	aah... sorry, i dont know of any.
2009-03-04T07:36:00.000Z	hmw	D3RGPS31	maybe you can run a windows version with wine?
2009-03-04T07:37:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	hmw	I come to ubuntu to escape microsoft, and closed-source applications
2009-03-04T07:37:00.000Z	hmw	D3RGPS31	tell me more about that app, i will see, what I can find on the web.
2009-03-04T07:38:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	hmw	it's a language learning software; they claim to be #1, saying the US Govt. uses it :/
2009-03-04T07:38:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	hmw	Rosetta Stone, that is
2009-03-04T07:39:00.000Z	hmw	D3RGPS31	what language do you want to learn, what is your native one?
2009-03-04T07:39:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	hmw	i want to learn Georgian, my native is English
2009-03-04T07:40:00.000Z	hmw	D3RGPS31	nothing found so far, except that thread about using the win version in wine: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=607470
2009-03-04T07:40:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	hmw	thanks anyway :/
2009-03-04T07:43:00.000Z	hmw	D3RGPS31	google results indicate, there is no *nix version of the software. Searching for +ubuntu "rosetta stone" brings up several interesting looking results, though. Looks like you need to install it either in wine or in a virtual machine. Didnt find any language learning software so far.
2009-03-04T07:45:00.000Z	hmw	D3RGPS31	go to http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-335292.html and search the page for "Mango"
2009-03-04T07:47:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	hmw	never mind, i'll stick to tutoring
2009-03-04T07:49:00.000Z	hmw	D3RGPS31	okay. Last info: gniall seems to be a gnome language learning app. Couldn't find out, if Georgian is included.
