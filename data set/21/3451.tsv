2012-09-12T00:31:00.000Z	strombom		Hi, where can I find out how to start a gui program as root/sudo automatically after login?
2012-09-12T00:31:00.000Z	strombom		I have tried for five hours >_<
2012-09-12T00:32:00.000Z	strombom		i really want to do that
2012-09-12T00:32:00.000Z	strombom		a SDL animation that i wrote
2012-09-12T00:32:00.000Z	strombom		its on an embedded platform, i don't care about security issues
2012-09-12T00:32:00.000Z	dr_willis	strombom	 a script in your .config/autostart directory
2012-09-12T00:32:00.000Z	strombom		but it needs to access hardware so i need root
2012-09-12T00:32:00.000Z	strombom		config/autostart, thanks i will check!
2012-09-12T00:33:00.000Z	dr_willis		 .config
2012-09-12T00:33:00.000Z	dr_willis		or was it .local
2012-09-12T00:34:00.000Z	dr_willis		they need to link it to a dir in home. :)
2012-09-12T00:35:00.000Z	dr_willis		  /home/billgates/Autostart  ')
2012-09-12T00:36:00.000Z	strombom		it seems like the "startup applicatinos" goes to that dir; .config/autostart, so unfortunately i have already tried
2012-09-12T00:36:00.000Z	strombom		i added "Exec=gksudo /home/ro/src/exhibit_robot"
2012-09-12T00:36:00.000Z	dr_willis	strombom	 id say you did it wrong then
2012-09-12T00:36:00.000Z	strombom		and added  /home/ro/src/exhibit_robot to the sudoers file (which seems to work)
2012-09-12T00:36:00.000Z	strombom		ok
2012-09-12T00:37:00.000Z	dr_willis		just use a bash script thats executable perhaps
2012-09-12T00:37:00.000Z	strombom		i tried that and got it booting once :) but not always, i'm going crazy
2012-09-12T00:37:00.000Z	dr_willis		put a delay in the script  sleep 20
2012-09-12T00:38:00.000Z	strombom	dr_willis	thanks i will try
