2011-09-15T01:01:00.000Z	cordoval		anynoe can help me?
2011-09-15T01:01:00.000Z	cordoval		setting up a shared connection
2011-09-15T01:01:00.000Z	cordoval		can't make the wireless show up
2011-09-15T01:02:00.000Z	yeats	cordoval	do you have a wireless card that will broadcast (rather than just receive)?
2011-09-15T01:02:00.000Z	cordoval	yeats	I have not set one if that is what you mean, I see BSSDI on my main connected lappy
2011-09-15T01:03:00.000Z	cordoval	yeats	how to check?
2011-09-15T01:03:00.000Z	yeats	cordoval	if you don't know, you probably don't have the hardware to do what you're trying to do
2011-09-15T01:03:00.000Z	cordoval		hmmm, I have an asus g73jw pretty sure could have that capability
2011-09-15T01:04:00.000Z	cordoval		although i think it has a bad card
2011-09-15T01:04:00.000Z	cordoval		but I  have seen that done with an hp lappy
2011-09-15T01:04:00.000Z	yeats	cordoval	a typical laptop wireless card just receives signals, it doesn't broadcast - FYI
2011-09-15T01:04:00.000Z	yeats	cordoval	you can very easily share the wireless connection to another computer via the ethernet port
2011-09-15T01:05:00.000Z	cordoval		that I already do
2011-09-15T01:05:00.000Z	yeats	cordoval	but not the other way around ;-)
2011-09-15T01:05:00.000Z	cordoval	yeats	I want to share the wireless as well
2011-09-15T01:05:00.000Z	cordoval		not the other way around
2011-09-15T01:05:00.000Z	yeats	cordoval	you probably need to buy hardware for that
2011-09-15T01:05:00.000Z	yeats		!mint | dtsuser
2011-09-15T01:05:00.000Z	cordoval		oh hmm which hardware?
2011-09-15T01:05:00.000Z	yeats	cordoval	no idea, sorry
2011-09-15T01:05:00.000Z	cordoval	yeats	then you don't know?
