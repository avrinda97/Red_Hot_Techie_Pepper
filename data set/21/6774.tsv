2007-01-29T16:10:00.000Z	Ferret	Eon_	That's probably a bug in the Composite extension. I suggest disabling it in X to determine if this is the case.
2007-01-29T16:11:00.000Z	Ferret	Eon_	to do that, edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf, find the Extensions section, and add: Option "Composite" "Disable"
2007-01-29T16:12:00.000Z	Eon_	Ferret	thanks, ill give that a try.
2007-01-29T16:16:00.000Z	Eon_	Ferret	i cant see the "extentions" section. Do you mean to place that line under the "inputDevice" section (for mouse) ?
2007-01-29T16:18:00.000Z	Ferret	Eon_	see the bottom of http://rpm.livna.org/rlowiki/Packages/xorg-x11-drv-fglrx
2007-01-29T16:18:00.000Z	Ferret	Eon_	Just paste that code snippet to the bottom of your xorg.conf file, should be fine
2007-01-29T16:22:00.000Z	Ferret	Eon_	Let's check to make sure composite actually got disabled -- xdpyinfo | grep -i composite
2007-01-29T16:22:00.000Z	Ferret	Eon_	No output means it's disabled
2007-01-29T16:27:00.000Z	Eon_	Ferret	im sorry, i didnt use your name before so maybe you didnt see my text. Typing that gave no output in console.
2007-01-29T16:29:00.000Z	Ferret	Eon_	Hrmm, OK... better re-enable Composite then in case you need it later.  go put a # sign in front of the lines you added...
2007-01-29T16:29:00.000Z	Ferret	Eon_	After that next step will probably be to reinstall the ati driver, but you'll have to ask these guys how to do that 'cos I don't know (I don't actually run ubuntu)
2007-01-29T16:31:00.000Z	Ferret	Eon_	Well, I had a quick look online about it, I'll show you what I found... http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-245143.html
2007-01-29T16:34:00.000Z	Ferret	Eon_	I found... http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-245143.html
2007-01-29T16:34:00.000Z	Ferret	Eon_	I suggest you have a look through /var/log/Xorg.0.log for warnings and errors. c.c
2007-01-29T16:36:00.000Z	Ferret	Eon_	Yep.
2007-01-29T16:39:00.000Z	Eon_	Ferret	there are some errors complaining about some fonts, but thats all i see.
2007-01-29T16:42:00.000Z	Ferret	Eon_	Try this:  grep DRI /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2007-01-29T16:43:00.000Z	Ferret	Eon_	If that doesn't find anything, then it would appear that the cause of your problem is totally different from the others. x.x
2007-01-29T16:44:00.000Z	Eon_	Ferret	now we got something... On both monitors i get DRI initialization failed, Screen 0/1 not DRI capable. Texured video not supported.   If this is the problem, it seems like its on both monitors so why does my cursor work on one of them? :P
2007-01-29T16:47:00.000Z	Ferret	Eon_	Not sure, but at least we're closer to the issue.  I suggest you try asking in #xorg, stating the problem and pasting a link to your log (upload it at pastebin.ca or similar)
2007-01-29T16:48:00.000Z	Eon_	Ferret	OK, thanks a ton for your help :=)
