2006-04-13T08:33:00.000Z	fak3r	OrTigaS	ok, what app isn't playing the stream?
2006-04-13T08:53:00.000Z	OrTigaS	fak3r	 its an internet radio
2006-04-13T08:59:00.000Z	fak3r	OrTigaS	it's an internet radio...do you have a URL we can look at it on?
2006-04-13T09:01:00.000Z	fak3r	OrTigaS	looks like it wants to launch Windows media player; do you have Mplayer installed with all the plugins/win32codes?
2006-04-13T09:03:00.000Z	fak3r	OrTigaS	so can you just run Mplayer, then Open -> URL and put in this: mms://fm.martin.bitstop.ph/mareco_cebu
2006-04-13T09:03:00.000Z	fak3r	OrTigaS	that'll tell us if it can play it

2006-04-13T09:08:00.000Z	fak3r	OrTigaS	I'm on my ibook, just booted my desktop to see if I can listen on Ubuntu...
2006-04-13T09:12:00.000Z	fak3r	OrTigaS	hmf...yeah, it wants to open in Totem - but then that gives me the error: Location not found.
2006-04-13T09:17:00.000Z	OrTigaS	fak3r	 it can be solve?
2006-04-13T09:17:00.000Z	fak3r	OrTigaS	I can't play it in any audio player ;( maybe ask on ubu-forum...sorry, but Totem, Rhythmbox, Xmms...none will open for me
