2010-12-31T17:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		a directory of soft links is not 'quiet' the same as how win7's library works.
2010-12-31T17:37:00.000Z	ubuman	Dr_Willis	well that is a comfort

2010-12-31T18:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuman	 its a plymouth/neauvu driver issue from what ive read.
2010-12-31T18:53:00.000Z	ubuman	Dr_Willis	well a lot of docs are awfully out of date these days
2010-12-31T18:54:00.000Z	ubuman	Dr_Willis	like I've udev issues and what I've seen out there on the topic is a mess
2010-12-31T19:19:00.000Z	ubuman	Dr_Willis	I used wine once it wasn't that simple
2010-12-31T19:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuman	 it  is that simple to get a exe going...
2010-12-31T19:20:00.000Z	ubuman	Dr_Willis	masybe if you have windows installed it is that easy but if you don't it isn't
2010-12-31T19:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuman	 the fact you needed to use 'winetricks' dosent  really matter. :)
2010-12-31T19:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuman	 and you DONT need windows installed to run  stuff in wine.  in fact that can make things run worse in wine if you run them from a existing windows install.

2010-12-31T19:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuman	 i recall that nautilus-elementry had a built in terminal window also.
