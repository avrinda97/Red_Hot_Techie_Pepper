2008-02-04T02:36:00.000Z	speedhunt3r		Can someone help me troubleshoot Samaba? I followed the official guide for file sharing so that I can join MSHOME and see the PCs running windows on the network but i can't see anything, where do I look for any problems? I have no clue.
2008-02-04T02:36:00.000Z	simps	speedhunt3r	did you configure the smb.conf file?
2008-02-04T02:38:00.000Z	simps	speedhunt3r	if its a local network, then it should show the files pretty quickly
2008-02-04T02:38:00.000Z	speedhunt3r	simps	i'm not sure whta you're talking about.
2008-02-04T02:38:00.000Z	speedhunt3r	simps	about configuring the smb.conf file.
2008-02-04T02:39:00.000Z	simps	speedhunt3r	sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
2008-02-04T02:40:00.000Z	speedhunt3r	simps	what do i do next?
2008-02-04T02:41:00.000Z	simps	speedhunt3r	you see a file loaded, right?
2008-02-04T02:41:00.000Z	speedhunt3r	simps	yes I can see the config file.
2008-02-04T02:41:00.000Z	simps	speedhunt3r	scroll down until you see "workgroup"
2008-02-04T02:42:00.000Z	simps	speedhunt3r	change that to whatever network you connect to from windows
2008-02-04T02:43:00.000Z	simps	speedhunt3r	so the line should be "workgroup = networknamehere"
2008-02-04T02:44:00.000Z	speedhunt3r	simps	it's workgroup = MSHOME as it should be.
2008-02-04T02:45:00.000Z	speedhunt3r	simps	here's another thing, when I try to set a smbpaswd it says connection to local host timed out...
2008-02-04T02:45:00.000Z	simps	speedhunt3r	press ctrl+w and then search for [homes]
2008-02-04T02:46:00.000Z	speedhunt3r	simps	found homes...browseable = yes
2008-02-04T02:47:00.000Z	speedhunt3r	simps	the PC running XP can see my computer, I just can't see any pcs over here...
2008-02-04T02:48:00.000Z	speedhunt3r	simps	the xp PC can see my computer but when i try to access it, it says network path not found.
