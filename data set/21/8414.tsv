2006-04-23T06:52:00.000Z	nickgarvey	eyequeue	what does putting a number in front of mount do?
2006-04-23T06:53:00.000Z	nickgarvey	eyequeue	when searching the man page
2006-04-23T06:53:00.000Z	eyequeue	nickgarvey	pulls from a specific "section" of the "manual" ... 8 grabs admin-ish commands
2006-04-23T06:54:00.000Z	eyequeue	nickgarvey	the last line in /etc/manpath.config probably lists the default order on your box, but "man man" should explain the concepts at least
2006-04-23T06:55:00.000Z	nickgarvey	eyequeue	okie thanks again
2006-04-23T06:55:00.000Z	eyequeue	nickgarvey	np
2006-04-23T08:31:00.000Z	eyequeue	nickgarvey	apt-get -b source gcc3.4  ;)
2006-04-23T08:31:00.000Z	nickgarvey	eyequeue	psh that makes it too easy
2006-04-23T08:38:00.000Z	eyequeue	nickgarvey	apt-cache show foo | grep Installed-Size
2006-04-23T08:38:00.000Z	nickgarvey	eyequeue	thank you
2006-04-23T08:38:00.000Z	eyequeue	nickgarvey	play a bit with apt-cache show foo on a package you know well
2006-04-23T08:38:00.000Z	nickgarvey	eyequeue	friend asked how big python was
2006-04-23T08:39:00.000Z	eyequeue	nickgarvey	apt-cache show python2.4 | grep Installed-Size, probably
2006-04-23T08:39:00.000Z	nickgarvey	eyequeue	yup, its a weird number though
2006-04-23T08:39:00.000Z	nickgarvey	eyequeue	one of those that I would normally use -h on ;)
2006-04-23T08:40:00.000Z	eyequeue	nickgarvey	"python" is just the meta-package that installs the preferred version of the current release, i think 2.4 for both breezy and dapper, but unsure
2006-04-23T08:41:00.000Z	eyequeue	nickgarvey	if ever you DO pull up something tiny, grep for Depends, and see what the real package it pulls in is
2006-04-23T08:42:00.000Z	nickgarvey	eyequeue	alright, thanks, that explains how python got so small heh
2006-04-23T10:24:00.000Z	eyequeue	nickgarvey	compiling it?  it could, depending on the cpu speed and how much you build into it
2006-04-23T10:25:00.000Z	nickgarvey	eyequeue	no just an update, no compiling
2006-04-23T10:26:00.000Z	eyequeue	nickgarvey	as in, d/l the new deb, install it, run grub, and reboot?  the d/l is the bottleneck, if you're on an ancient modem maybe, heh
