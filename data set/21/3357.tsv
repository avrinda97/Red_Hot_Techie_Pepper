2009-02-02T05:40:00.000Z	koshar2	Krstnsn	dont panic , just check the synaptic history and it all should be there what was changed, you can install ubuntu-desktop metapackage and all the default stuff will be reinstalled
2009-02-02T05:41:00.000Z	Krstnsn		why would it do that? thats messed up .. so what do i do to restore?
2009-02-02T05:42:00.000Z	Krstnsn		im not that savvy
2009-02-02T05:44:00.000Z	Krstnsn		but how do i know what the packages are?
2009-02-02T05:45:00.000Z	Krstnsn		so all 50 of those thing shave to be apt get? is there a command that restores everything?
2009-02-02T05:46:00.000Z	koshar2	Krstnsn	check the install log, synaptic => file => history
2009-02-02T05:47:00.000Z	koshar2	Krstnsn	and again if you install ubuntu -desktop it WILL restore all the default packages
2009-02-02T05:47:00.000Z	Krstnsn		http://www.pastebin.cz/14831 it told me that.. didnt say it removed anything
2009-02-02T05:49:00.000Z	Krstnsn		koshar: when i apt get that ubuntu-desktop it says ... E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily unavailable)
2009-02-02T05:49:00.000Z	Krstnsn		E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?
2009-02-02T05:50:00.000Z	Krstnsn	koshar2	nevermind.. i had process running
