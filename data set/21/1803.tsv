2010-04-28T07:36:00.000Z	voss749		things that Ubuntu needs that it doesnt have . An easy to use desktop publishing program that doubles as web page making
2010-04-28T07:37:00.000Z	Guest39421	voss749	like Publisher?
2010-04-28T07:38:00.000Z	Guest39421	voss749	Adobe InDesign can make web pages, but you dont want to use it lol. I think desktop publishing and web page creation are seperate for good reason
2010-04-28T07:39:00.000Z	voss749	Guest39421	but publisher is very good for basic web creation and basic desktop publishing. The openoffice people dont seem to understand that
2010-04-28T07:39:00.000Z	Guest39421	voss749	not for making webpages I hope
2010-04-28T07:40:00.000Z	Guest39421	voss749	sorry to hear that lol
2010-04-28T07:40:00.000Z	Guest39421	voss749	i bet they validate real nice too.
2010-04-28T07:41:00.000Z	voss749	Guest39421	who cares about validation. You look at the webpage in IE, firefox, safari, and opera if it looks fine its good enough
2010-04-28T07:43:00.000Z	Guest39421	voss749	and that is why people shouldnt use frontpage lol
2010-04-28T07:44:00.000Z	Guest39421	voss749	not just iPhone, people using assitive devices, web crawlers, etc
2010-04-28T07:46:00.000Z	Guest39421	voss749	no, publisher is the problem, not the solution lol
2010-04-28T07:47:00.000Z	Guest39421	voss749	if you use publisher you dont code a thing haha
2010-04-28T07:50:00.000Z	Guest39421	voss749	thats just silly. lol two completely different animals
2010-04-28T07:52:00.000Z	Guest39421	voss749	web pages arew dynamic, they are user interfaces and experiences. Print is static.
2010-04-28T07:54:00.000Z	Guest39421	voss749	web pages dont need to be static. they arent just publications either. You can book plane ticket, buy stuff, download things, interact with people, etc
2010-04-28T07:55:00.000Z	voss749	Guest39421	Most people need all that stuff on their webpage
2010-04-28T07:56:00.000Z	Guest39421	voss749	that is silly. maybe in 1990 they didnt. Thats what the web has become.
2010-04-28T08:00:00.000Z	Guest39421	voss749	i have never heard of printshop lol
2010-04-28T08:03:00.000Z	Guest39421	voss749	learning web design with publisher is like... learning teaching drivers ed with a moped.
2010-04-28T08:04:00.000Z	Guest39421	voss749	huh?
