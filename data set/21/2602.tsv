2009-10-30T22:21:00.000Z	roy		Hi! my ubuntu 9.04 is currently using ~20GB in 4 partitions. I want to make a fresh install of the Karmic in that space, in new ext4 partitions. How should I allocate the spaces and what partitions would be idal ... with 2GB RAM?
2009-10-30T22:22:00.000Z	Berzerker-	roy	you can have ubuntu automatically manage it for you, if you don't need to keep all 4 partitions
2009-10-30T22:26:00.000Z	Berzerker-	roy	do you need the other partitions?
2009-10-30T22:27:00.000Z	Berzerker-	roy	I wouldn't have 3 OSs installed on a 20GB hard drive.
2009-10-30T22:29:00.000Z	Berzerker-	roy	ah, I see.
2009-10-30T22:30:00.000Z	Berzerker-	roy	if you're not using it as a main OS, I'd give it close to 40-50GB with about 512-1GB of swap space.
2009-10-30T22:31:00.000Z	Berzerker-	roy	20GB is fine, I'm barely using 10. 768MB of swap space should do.
2009-10-30T22:33:00.000Z	Berzerker-	roy	just mount it as /, everything will be under /
2009-10-30T22:41:00.000Z	Berzerker-	roy	sorry, 19.3GB for / and 700MB for swap is ideal
2009-10-30T22:41:00.000Z	Berzerker-	roy	everything will be under /
2009-10-30T22:44:00.000Z	Berzerker-	roy	so you can do 5GB for /, 14 for /home and 1 for swap
2009-10-30T22:46:00.000Z	Berzerker-	roy	swap space more than the amount of RAM you have is not useful
2009-10-30T22:47:00.000Z	Berzerker-	roy	you don't even need that much, 1GB will be fine.
2009-10-30T22:48:00.000Z	Berzerker-	roy	swap space only helps if you're performing heavy operations
2009-10-30T22:49:00.000Z	Berzerker-	roy	downloading a torrent doesn't do swap space useage
2009-10-30T22:49:00.000Z	Berzerker-	roy	neither does multitasking anything
2009-10-30T22:50:00.000Z	Berzerker-	roy	nope, video chatting is just internet.
2009-10-30T22:50:00.000Z	Berzerker-	roy	lots of video converstions
2009-10-30T22:55:00.000Z	Berzerker-	roy	anything more than 1GB is not necessary.
2009-10-30T22:55:00.000Z	Berzerker-	roy	1.5x-2.0x again, is an old rule
2009-10-30T22:55:00.000Z	Berzerker-	roy	1GB will be fine, really.
