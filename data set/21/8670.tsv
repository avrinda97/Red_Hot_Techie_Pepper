2006-02-21T10:28:00.000Z	Zazzie		hi, im having problems with a server running ubuntu. on almost all commands i give, i get an input/output error. i figured out this is due to the fact that my filesystem is mounted read-only which is caused by badblocks on my hd. now im trying to reboot the machine but i dont have fysical access and shutdown/reboot give i/oo errors aswell
2006-02-21T10:28:00.000Z	Zazzie		does anyone know how i can reboot the machine?
2006-02-21T10:29:00.000Z	fangorious	Zazzie	sudo reboot
2006-02-21T10:29:00.000Z	Zazzie	fangorious	like i said... that gives an i/o error
2006-02-21T10:29:00.000Z	fangorious	Zazzie	sorry, missed that
2006-02-21T10:29:00.000Z	Zazzie	fangorious	np :)
2006-02-21T10:29:00.000Z	fangorious	Zazzie	maybe sudo telinit 6
2006-02-21T10:29:00.000Z	Zazzie		ill try.. runlevel 6 is reboot?
2006-02-21T10:30:00.000Z	fangorious	Zazzie	yes
2006-02-21T10:30:00.000Z	Zazzie		telinit 6 does nothing.. :(
2006-02-21T10:31:00.000Z	Zazzie		no error and no output :(
2006-02-21T10:31:00.000Z	Zazzie		and no reboot :(
2006-02-21T10:33:00.000Z	Zazzie	fangorious	any other idea's ? :)
2006-02-21T10:34:00.000Z	fangorious	Zazzie	ctl.alt.del maps to '/sbin/shutdown -t1 -a -r now' so maybe that will help
2006-02-21T10:34:00.000Z	Zazzie		/sbin/shutdown -t1 -a -r now
2006-02-21T10:34:00.000Z	Zazzie		-bash: /sbin/shutdown: Input/output error
2006-02-21T10:35:00.000Z	fangorious	Zazzie	nobody you can contact who has physical access?
2006-02-21T10:35:00.000Z	Zazzie		well no... its in a datacenter..
2006-02-21T10:36:00.000Z	Zazzie		i think im going to have to jump in a car and go there :(
2006-02-21T10:36:00.000Z	fangorious	Zazzie	and they don't have 24-7 attendants?
2006-02-21T10:36:00.000Z	Zazzie	fangorious	i think so... gonna try that..
