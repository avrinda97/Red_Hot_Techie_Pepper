2005-08-07T14:51:00.000Z	python_		sexcopter: I think Gimp can do that for you
2005-08-07T14:53:00.000Z	python_		depends what we define what a video is though
2005-08-07T14:53:00.000Z	python_		a video in truth is many moving images
2005-08-07T14:53:00.000Z	python_		what output do you need for this video
2005-08-07T14:53:00.000Z	f_newton	python_	I dont think he is worried about the philosophy of video
2005-08-07T14:54:00.000Z	f_newton		I think he wants to join clips together to make a flowing video
2005-08-07T14:54:00.000Z	python_		sexcopter: what file ouput wld u like from your images
2005-08-07T14:55:00.000Z	f_newton		some say mythtv will do that sexcopter8000m but I dont know myself
2005-08-07T14:58:00.000Z	python_		sexcopter: have a look at an app could kino
2005-08-07T15:02:00.000Z	python_		sexcopter: Use kino i think the package will be ideal for what you need
2005-08-07T15:02:00.000Z	python_		Go to the website sexcopter type kino in google
2005-08-07T15:03:00.000Z	python_		sexcopter: http://kino.schirmacher.de/
2005-08-07T15:06:00.000Z	f_newton	python_	actually gimp would do what sexcopter8000m was wanting
2005-08-07T15:07:00.000Z	python_	f_newton	it probably could, but i feel kino will be more geared to what he wants with added capabilities such as transitions, etc
2005-08-07T15:08:00.000Z	f_newton		I misunderstood his need
2005-08-07T15:08:00.000Z	python_		However i must point out to photoshop users (which i once was), i use GIMP all the time and its a great piece of software
2005-08-07T15:08:00.000Z	f_newton		yes it is linux's answer to photoshop
2005-08-07T15:09:00.000Z	python_	f_newton	i laways use it at work instead of Photoshop, it takes photoshop 2 hours too load
2005-08-07T15:10:00.000Z	f_newton		yer being funny, but photoshop is a very good program
2005-08-07T15:10:00.000Z	python_	f_newton	it is but i refuse to use proprietry software at home
2005-08-07T15:10:00.000Z	f_newton	python_	adobe is the ultimate in propriety software too
