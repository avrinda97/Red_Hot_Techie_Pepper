2005-07-23T14:02:00.000Z	PLaf	anto9us	no i downloaded a program to just copy a bios, the problem is i need to find the latest version of mine
2005-07-23T14:02:00.000Z	anto9us	PLaf	you visited your motherboard manufacturer's website?
2005-07-23T14:03:00.000Z	PLaf	anto9us	no, i dont know who made it
2005-07-23T14:04:00.000Z	anto9us	PLaf	reboot and make a note of the very long ID at the bottom of the screen when it boots, you might need to keep resetting till you've got it all, it can disappear quickly
2005-07-23T14:04:00.000Z	PLaf		later
2005-07-23T14:04:00.000Z	PLaf	anto9us	no ID comes up
2005-07-23T14:04:00.000Z	PLaf		it just flashes an extremely large IBM picture, then boots, so i dont know the model number
2005-07-23T14:05:00.000Z	anto9us	PLaf	you system isn't from a major manufacturer, like Dell or anyone like that?
