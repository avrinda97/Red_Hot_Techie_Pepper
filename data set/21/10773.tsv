2005-08-29T16:38:00.000Z	Xenguy	Seveas	really?
2005-08-29T16:39:00.000Z	Xenguy	Seveas	why do you say "ubuntuguide is bad" ?
2005-08-29T16:41:00.000Z	Xenguy	Seveas	OK, thanks for that - I'll have a closer look, but my first impression was that the Guide was pretty impressive
2005-08-29T16:49:00.000Z	Seveas	Xenguy	it cannot be because it explains nothing :)
2005-08-29T16:49:00.000Z	Xenguy	Seveas	OK, I'm going to take a second look now :-)
2005-08-29T16:58:00.000Z	Xenguy	Seveas	hrm, IMHO it is reasonable to warn newbies that Ubuntuguide is not oriented towards total newbies, but I don't think it makes sense to warn everyone off the guide entirely.  There are some nice tips and tricks in there that can be useful to many people.  YMMV  :-)
2005-08-29T16:58:00.000Z	Seveas	Xenguy	the mileage varies too much for the thing to be useful
2005-08-29T16:59:00.000Z	Xenguy	Seveas	I think the statement "Ubuntuguide is bad" is far too extreme.  Again, just my humble opinion.
2005-09-24T15:52:00.000Z	Seveas	Xenguy	just edit /etc/network/interfaces
2005-09-24T15:52:00.000Z	Xenguy	Seveas	OK, will do - there was no /etc/resolv.conf either, but I manually added that just now
2005-09-25T16:01:00.000Z	Xenguy	Seveas	editing /etc/network/interfaces worked nicely -- thank you (I should have known that by now :-)
2006-03-10T14:38:00.000Z	Seveas	Xenguy	dhclient clears it
2006-03-10T14:39:00.000Z	Xenguy	Seveas	ahh, I stand corrected
2006-03-20T16:15:00.000Z	Seveas	Xenguy	not anymore ;)
2006-03-20T16:16:00.000Z	Xenguy	Seveas	indeed; the buffer is my evidence
2006-04-10T06:10:00.000Z	Seveas	Xenguy	failed ;)
2006-04-29T16:20:00.000Z	Xenguy	Seveas	Some feedback on freenx (using your breezy packages, and wiki instructions):  My setup works fine with a linux client, but fails with latest windows client (from nomachine.com).  Errors are pasted here: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/12805   Questions on my mind (after much fruitless googling):  Should I try an earlier windows client version? (if yes, is there a cache of earlier client EXE's?); should I try VNC via the windows client instead?  An
2006-04-29T16:22:00.000Z	Xenguy	Seveas	oh, one more question: do I need to do a 'nxserver --adduser' on the server side at all?
2006-04-29T16:23:00.000Z	Seveas	Xenguy	no you should *NOT* do that
2006-04-29T06:01:00.000Z	Xenguy	Seveas	OK, I did not do it (nxserver --adduser), just grasping at straws/ideas as to what I can do to get the windows client to work with my Ubu/Breezy freenx server setup (as I mentioned, the current setup works with the linux 'nxclient')
2006-04-29T06:03:00.000Z	Xenguy	Seveas	basically ssh authentication seems fine; it is when it gets to the X connection stage that something fails :-/
