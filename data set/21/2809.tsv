2010-12-31T19:04:00.000Z	parolang		Does anyone know how to bring the internet back up from the commandline?  The start/restart commands don't seem to work for me.
2010-12-31T19:05:00.000Z	parolang		wifi
2010-12-31T19:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	parolang	sudo service networking stop; sudo service networking start; sudo dhclient3 eth0    is one example
2010-12-31T19:06:00.000Z	parolang	ActionParsnip	See...like I type status networking and it tells me: networking stop/waiting.  It tells me this when internet is up and running, and when it isn't.
2010-12-31T19:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	parolang	mine says stop/waiting too, on this system I am typing to you on
2010-12-31T19:07:00.000Z	parolang	ActionParsnip	And when I hit start networking when internet isn't running, all it tells me, again, is networking stop/waiting.
2010-12-31T19:08:00.000Z	parolang	ActionParsnip	So I've been having to reboot to get internet working again.
2010-12-31T19:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	parolang	try rmmodding the interface driver, then reload it back in then restart networking
2010-12-31T19:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	parolang	if you run:  sudo lshw -C network    and read, you will see the driver name, you can then run:  sudo modprobe -r module; sudo modprobe module
2010-12-31T19:22:00.000Z	parolang	ActionParsnip	Okay.  So that restarts the networking driver?
2010-12-31T19:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	parolang	it will make the device stop workin, then wake up again. obviously change module for the actual module name
2010-12-31T19:23:00.000Z	parolang	ActionParsnip	Okay.  Thanks.
2010-12-31T19:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	parolang	it installs vi and nano instead. You can remaster the install ISO if you want and make it install by default
2010-12-31T19:44:00.000Z	parolang	ActionParsnip	Hmm...vi is bare knuckles, and I can't believe people like gedit
2010-12-31T19:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	parolang	i use nano pesonally, works fine
2010-12-31T19:45:00.000Z	parolang	ActionParsnip	Nano is (obviously) bare knuckles too.  I think it was supposed to be a Pico clone.
2010-12-31T19:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	parolang	no idea, i just know it does text editting easy enough
2010-12-31T19:46:00.000Z	parolang	ActionParsnip	I guess it depends on what sort of text editing you do; and whether a more powerful editor would make thing easier/better for you.
2010-12-31T19:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	parolang	exactly, tool for the job ;)
2010-12-31T19:48:00.000Z	parolang	ActionParsnip	Yeah, except all the tools are written in elisp :D
2010-12-31T19:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	parolang	as long as it works ok it can be written in pascal for all I care
