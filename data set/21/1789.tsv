2010-04-30T03:09:00.000Z	Damo2k		I have Windows 7, and im trying to dual boot with Ubuntu 10.04, im not seeing the "install side by side" option when trying to install, what may cause this ?
2010-04-30T03:11:00.000Z	Damo2k		Ubuntu isn't giving me an option to resize my partition, so I can't dual boot
2010-04-30T03:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Damo2k	what is the current OS?
2010-04-30T03:11:00.000Z	Damo2k	ActionParsnip	Windows 7
2010-04-30T03:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Damo2k	win7 can resize its own partitions
2010-04-30T03:12:00.000Z	Damo2k	ActionParsnip	I just finished a defrag, and I have 210GB free, I am better using Windows 7 to resize the partition ?
2010-04-30T03:12:00.000Z	Damo2k	ActionParsnip	and 30Gb is plenty for Ubuntu?
2010-04-30T03:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Damo2k	yes as it will manage its own files etc
2010-04-30T03:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Damo2k	most netbooks get by with about 4Gb
2010-04-30T03:13:00.000Z	Damo2k	ActionParsnip	what is recommended swap partition size?
2010-04-30T03:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Damo2k	2xram for less than 2Gb. 1xram for 2gb or more
2010-04-30T03:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Damo2k	if you have a stupendous amount of ram it may not even be needed
2010-04-30T03:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Damo2k	then 4gb swap wil be fine. it will enable hibernate etc
2010-04-30T03:15:00.000Z	Damo2k	ActionParsnip	so I allocate 4GB swap on disk also ?
2010-04-30T03:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Damo2k	yes
2010-04-30T03:16:00.000Z	Damo2k	ActionParsnip	 so thats 4gb ram + 4gb swap, is that too much?
2010-04-30T03:16:00.000Z	Damo2k	ActionParsnip	CaptainTrek, joaopinto  thanks guys
2010-04-30T03:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Damo2k	if you just want to web browse an d chat etc then swap isnt needed, depends what the ubuntu os is for
2010-04-30T03:17:00.000Z	Damo2k	ActionParsnip	its more for experimentation, I havent messed with ubuntu since 8.10
2010-04-30T03:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Damo2k	then you can omit it if you want, but 4gb is the norm for 4gb ram
2010-04-30T03:18:00.000Z	Damo2k	ActionParsnip	I will try that now, thanks.. Chat to you later.
