2008-04-27T07:32:00.000Z	Pelo	shane2peru	rightcilck unmount
2008-04-27T07:32:00.000Z	shane2peru	Pelo	I don't want it to mount it when I plug it in
2008-04-27T07:32:00.000Z	shane2peru	Pelo	I'm trying to recover a bad hdd, via usb
2008-04-27T07:33:00.000Z	Pelo	shane2peru	err , chck in the nautilus prefs under the edit menu
2008-04-27T07:34:00.000Z	shane2peru	Pelo	ok, it used to be under System -> Prefs -> removable devices, however that isn't it now.
2008-04-27T07:37:00.000Z	shane2peru	Pelo	that did it, thanks!
2008-05-13T18:49:00.000Z	Pelo	shane2peru	more details
2008-05-13T18:50:00.000Z	shane2peru	Pelo	1.5GB of my 3GB swap is being used when nothing is running
2008-05-13T18:50:00.000Z	Pelo	shane2peru	the report is not relaible,  is your system actualy slowing down ?
2008-05-13T18:51:00.000Z	shane2peru	Pelo	right, but when I run:  free I get the same results, no the system is running fine.
2008-05-13T18:51:00.000Z	shane2peru	Pelo	just bothers me to see the swap graph half full. :)
2008-05-13T18:51:00.000Z	shane2peru	Pelo	on system monitor that is.
2008-05-13T18:52:00.000Z	Pelo	shane2peru	I beleive the swap just doesn'T get updated unless new room is needed,  don'T worry about it to much , I get more or less the same
2008-05-13T18:52:00.000Z	shane2peru	Pelo	ok, that is what I was wondering.  thanks!
2008-05-13T18:52:00.000Z	Pelo	shane2peru	not in actual usage , just in stuff not going away aftetr the app stops
2008-05-13T18:53:00.000Z	shane2peru	Pelo	ahh, because it is swap space, it just stays written there until overwritten?
2008-05-13T18:53:00.000Z	Pelo	shane2peru	something like that
2008-05-13T18:53:00.000Z	shane2peru	Pelo	makes sense, thanks
2008-05-13T18:54:00.000Z	Pelo	shane2peru	you can expect that if swap was being treated the same way as memory the write/erase would probably ware the hdd down
2008-05-13T18:54:00.000Z	shane2peru	Pelo	very true.
