2008-10-24T19:54:00.000Z	iShock		Alrighty .. I booted from my Acer Upgrade CD for vista, and it doesn't seem to find a boot problem any more, and 'fixmbr' and 'fixboot' aren't recognized as internal or external programs in the command prompt .. But it's STILL trying to boot from GRUB .. Any idea?

2008-10-24T19:58:00.000Z	iShock		Anyone at all?....
2008-10-24T19:59:00.000Z	Slart	iShock	grub is installed to the mbr (probably)
2008-10-24T19:59:00.000Z	iShock	Slart	No duh, I want it to go away though! :'(
2008-10-24T19:59:00.000Z	Slart	iShock	I have no idea what the cd from acer does or why it doesn't work with those commands
2008-10-24T20:00:00.000Z	iShock	Slart	I'm in the repair your computer section, and the automatic doo-dad is failing.
2008-10-24T20:00:00.000Z	Slart	iShock	you'll have to install another mbr.. the fixmbr command works on some windows install cd in rescue mode
2008-10-24T20:00:00.000Z	Slart	iShock	but we can't help you use your acer supplied software.. you'll have to ask acer for help with that.. or a windows channel perhaps
2008-10-24T20:01:00.000Z	Slart	iShock	nope.. not kidding
2008-10-24T20:01:00.000Z	iShock	Slart	it's a Windows vista install/upgrade cd, that came with my acer laptop ..
2008-10-24T20:02:00.000Z	Slart	iShock	yes, I know what it is.. I have one on my desk..I don't know how it works or what it does
2008-10-24T20:02:00.000Z	iShock	Slart	describe the disk (In PM if you must)
2008-10-24T20:04:00.000Z	Slart	iShock	no, I wont.. I won't boot it up just to try it.. it came with my acer laptop.. but back to the issue.. you've got a problem with a acer restore cd that reinstalls windows.. the ubuntu channel isn't the best place to ask for help with that
2008-10-24T20:05:00.000Z	iShock	Slart	you don't need to boot into it to tell me what the disk looks like .. But it's not a restore CD, it's an upgrade CD ..
2008-10-24T20:05:00.000Z	Slart	iShock	the mbr is a part of the hard drive (the first track), it just starts things up and then hands off to the rest of the boot program.. you have to have some kind of mbr (either the grub one or whatever comes with windows)
2008-10-24T20:06:00.000Z	Slart	iShock	you don't uninstall grub.. you install something else over it
2008-10-24T20:07:00.000Z	Slart	iShock	sorry for telling you the truth
2008-10-24T20:07:00.000Z	Slart	iShock	but realite doesn't change because you don't like it
2008-10-24T20:09:00.000Z	Slart	iShock	why not ask in ##windows , they might be able to help you fix your windows install, reinstall windows or whatever you want to do.. we can help you reinstall/install ubuntu
2009-01-06T20:30:00.000Z	Slart	iShock	I'm doing fancy things from morning til late evening (sometimes into the night too=).. but I can't recall asking about anything here
