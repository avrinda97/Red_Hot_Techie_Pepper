2005-11-09T16:09:00.000Z	Vorpulus		Is anyone good at networking on linux?
2005-11-09T16:09:00.000Z	trappist	Vorpulus	sudo apt-get install dhcp3-client
2005-11-09T16:10:00.000Z	Vorpulus	trappist	that resulted in all kinds of things starting with W: Couldn't start source package list
2005-11-09T16:30:00.000Z	trappist	Vorpulus	did you use sudo?  as in sudo apt-get install...
2005-11-09T16:31:00.000Z	trappist	Vorpulus	if you run 'dhclient' what does it say
2005-11-09T16:31:00.000Z	trappist	Vorpulus	open a console and type 'sudo dhclient'
2005-11-09T16:33:00.000Z	trappist	Vorpulus	it worked.  you have an ip address now.
2005-11-09T16:34:00.000Z	trappist	Vorpulus	all that should be left is to set up your browser and apt to use the proxy.
2005-11-09T16:35:00.000Z	trappist	Vorpulus	it does mean something.  now try sudo apt-get install vim or something
2005-11-09T16:36:00.000Z	Vorpulus	trappist	can I show you the university webpage I have on how to set this stuff up?
2005-11-09T16:36:00.000Z	trappist	Vorpulus	first, remind me what kind of error you get with apt-get
2005-11-09T16:38:00.000Z	trappist	Vorpulus	try sudo apt-get update
2005-11-09T16:38:00.000Z	trappist	Vorpulus	before, or now?
2005-11-09T16:40:00.000Z	trappist	Vorpulus	then it looks like some of your /etc/apt/sources.list is good and some isn't
2005-11-09T16:43:00.000Z	trappist	Vorpulus	paste any one line out of your sources.list here
2005-11-09T16:45:00.000Z	trappist	Vorpulus	I guess go ahead and paste your whole sources.list into pastebin
2005-11-09T16:48:00.000Z	trappist	Vorpulus	sudo dhclient
2005-11-09T16:49:00.000Z	Vorpulus	trappist	shall I type that in?
2005-11-09T16:49:00.000Z	trappist	Vorpulus	see if sudo apt-get update works now
2005-11-09T16:49:00.000Z	trappist	Vorpulus	if it's working again, no need
2005-11-09T16:50:00.000Z	trappist	Vorpulus	if your browser stopped working, it could be because you lost network connectivity, which would also break apt.
