2005-10-22T06:24:00.000Z	onkarshinde	GreenFireD	Read my reply above.
2005-10-22T06:25:00.000Z	onkarshinde	GreenFireD	/etc/apt/sources/list

2005-10-22T06:31:00.000Z	GreenFireD	onkarshinde	what to do with this?
2005-10-22T06:33:00.000Z	onkarshinde	GreenFireD	At least your file looks okay. type command  'sudo cp /etc/apt.sources.list.backup /etc/apt.sources.list' on terminal (without quotes) And then tell me what you want to install.
2005-10-22T07:41:00.000Z	onkarshinde	GreenFireD	What packages did you install?
2005-10-22T07:44:00.000Z	onkarshinde	GreenFireD	There is no such package as HebUbuntu. Where did you get it from?
2005-10-22T07:45:00.000Z	onkarshinde	GreenFireD	And what is it used for?
2005-10-22T07:47:00.000Z	onkarshinde	GreenFireD	It is best not to install something from unknown sources. You never know what will break. Use repositories as far as possible.
