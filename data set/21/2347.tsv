2010-03-03T07:33:00.000Z	jolaren		I have registered a domain name. I was thinking about setting up a mail server and I have a question. what happends if my server is down for a little while when receiving a imporante mail? will it just dissapear or reapparea?
2010-03-03T07:35:00.000Z	Nitsuga	jolaren	it will not deliver, and the sender server will try again after 5-30 minutos , if it cant's after a few attemptsthe sender will recieve a warning and the server will try again the folowwing day
2010-03-03T07:35:00.000Z	jolaren	Nitsuga	is it always like that? my server isnt' down that much.. just thinking in-case
2010-03-03T07:36:00.000Z	Nitsuga	jolaren	it is like hat in most mail service. At least Gmail, hotmail, yahoo and "sendmail" do that.
2010-03-03T07:36:00.000Z	jolaren	Nitsuga	CosmicHippo; Most big mail delievers does that so to speak or am I mistaken?
2010-03-03T07:37:00.000Z	Nitsuga	jolaren	no, it is something like this: mail.dallalba.com.ar
2010-03-03T07:37:00.000Z	Nitsuga	jolaren	my name is Agustin Dall'Alba, and I use Google Apps to host my domain's mail :)
2010-03-03T07:38:00.000Z	jolaren	Nitsuga	BHoward that sounds amazing.
2010-03-03T07:38:00.000Z	Nitsuga	jolaren	they gice you 30 mail accounts for you domain for free
2010-03-03T07:39:00.000Z	Nitsuga	jolaren	apps.google.com
2010-03-03T07:40:00.000Z	Nitsuga	jolaren	yes, it''s free for particulars and small busisness
2010-03-03T07:41:00.000Z	Nitsuga	jolaren	they give you 200 accounts for you domain with more that 7GB each one (and growing 4 bytes per second!)
2010-03-03T07:41:00.000Z	jolaren	Nitsuga	histo: So I will not use my own mail-server at all? Kinda sucks not beein able to set it up exactly as I want but I guess it's better than nothing - can I atleast point the domain to my ssh server?
2010-03-03T07:42:00.000Z	Nitsuga	jolaren	you just have to set up you MX domains to google's servers and (optionally) a CNAME to a subdomain of yours.
2010-03-03T07:43:00.000Z	Nitsuga	jolaren	also I personally find Gmail better than any desktop or web-based email clients out there. It even works offline!
2010-03-03T08:09:00.000Z	jolaren	Nitsuga	histo: Is it possible to link the g-mail account login or however you login to the mail adress you pointed to the Google Apps?
2010-03-03T08:09:00.000Z	jolaren	Nitsuga	histo: I mean so I can point them to my webpage.com
2010-03-03T08:10:00.000Z	Nitsuga	jolaren	yes of course. You have to make a CNAME record to google's servers
2010-03-03T08:11:00.000Z	jolaren	Nitsuga	I understand.. so the mail login will be hosted by google on my domain.. that's insanenly sweet.. I might move my webhotel which I pay for mail hosteage to google
2010-03-03T08:12:00.000Z	jolaren	Nitsuga	I'm just waiting for my accname/password for my domain and I'll give it a go! I'm super thrilled
2010-03-03T08:13:00.000Z	Nitsuga	jolaren	you can import the emails from you webhotel before shutting it down via POP3/IMAP, and again, for free
