2004-12-12T12:54:00.000Z	melazyboy		What is the mount command that specifies locales
2004-12-12T12:55:00.000Z	melazyboy		The best player for someone not willing to twink is by far 'vlc'
2004-12-12T12:56:00.000Z	Amaranth	melazyboy	yeah, its a shame vlc looks like ass :P
2004-12-12T12:57:00.000Z	melazyboy	Amaranth	the vidoe player's skin hardly matters when being played in full screen, and when not in full skin its a small ugly as compaired to other video players big bulky ugly
2004-12-17T15:50:00.000Z	melazyboy	Amaranth	Why would he have to compile from source? the image is just that the default tree already compiled
2004-12-17T15:51:00.000Z	Amaranth	melazyboy	Sure, but there isn't a package for anything higher then 2.6.8
2004-12-17T15:52:00.000Z	melazyboy	Amaranth	hrm i thought they just released 2.6.8 like uh last week i wonder why if there is a kernel tree for 2.6.9 there is no image for it
2004-12-17T15:52:00.000Z	Amaranth	melazyboy	heh, 2.6.8 is old
2004-12-17T15:53:00.000Z	melazyboy	Amaranth	Got me, my 2.6.8 is working A ok, i just want fglrx and xorg to work
2004-12-17T15:59:00.000Z	melazyboy	Amaranth	Thats a good question, how come the naming scheme changed, that was also what i was searching for
2004-12-17T16:27:00.000Z	Amaranth	melazyboy	Yeah, thats what Gecko puts in for a page that outputs nothing.
2004-12-17T16:41:00.000Z	Amaranth	melazyboy	I was doing that too.
2004-12-17T16:43:00.000Z	melazyboy	Amaranth	Don't care =D live dangerously they are essentially the same thing anyway, net install sid, install xorg, and gnome, totem, evolution, gaim and openoffice, and you get a rough equivelent to ubuntu =/
2004-12-17T16:44:00.000Z	Amaranth	melazyboy	Except that ubuntu's packages have 'ubuntu-x' on the end of the version.
2004-12-17T16:44:00.000Z	melazyboy	Amaranth	Right and when the number version differs to the point where ubuntu takes the lead, it will kick in when i apt-get dist-upgrade, because i take special precaution not to break ubuntu-desktop
2004-12-17T16:49:00.000Z	Amaranth	melazyboy	That is not the fault of xorg.
2004-12-17T16:51:00.000Z	Amaranth	melazyboy	What kind of Radeon do you have?
2004-12-17T16:51:00.000Z	melazyboy	Amaranth	9800
2004-12-17T16:53:00.000Z	melazyboy	Amaranth	Smart move.. ATI is a horrable company
2004-12-17T16:53:00.000Z	Amaranth	melazyboy	I'll probably never buy an nVidia card though. :P
2004-12-17T16:53:00.000Z	melazyboy	Amaranth	There drivers for windows are subpar, there drivers for linux are laughable...
