2005-01-29T07:12:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		why do you guys keep mentioning specific apps?
2005-01-29T07:12:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		i just want generic linux codecs.
2005-01-29T07:12:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		how can it not?
2005-01-29T07:13:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		if the os doesn't have codecs, then every app would have to have its own. that would be ridiculous.
2005-01-29T07:13:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		exactly
2005-01-29T07:13:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		but if an app tries to play some sound and the linux api doesn't have codecs, it can't play that file.
2005-01-29T07:14:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		not in beos.
2005-01-29T07:14:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		i didn't know linux was that far behind.
2005-01-29T07:15:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		far behind.
2005-01-29T07:15:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		apps shouldn't need to know about the media they decode.
2005-01-29T07:15:00.000Z	Ex-Cyber	BROKEN_LADDER	how it works is that the codec is a shared library (.so in Linux, .dll in Windows) ... it is not a component of "Linux" or "Windows", it is its own piece of software that player apps link into
2005-01-29T07:15:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		windows?!
2005-01-29T07:15:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		lol
2005-01-29T07:16:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	Ex-Cyber	 that's terribly poor design.
2005-01-29T07:16:00.000Z	Ex-Cyber	BROKEN_LADDER	what do you suggest as the alternative?
2005-01-29T07:16:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		beos
2005-01-29T07:16:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		in beos you just installed system codecs so any app could be agnostic to what it was opening.
2005-01-29T07:17:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		what i'm hearing here is that different apps in linux need their own codecs.
2005-01-29T07:17:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		gstreamer isn't part of the linux kernel.
2005-01-29T07:17:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		then that's a poor analogy to make.
2005-01-29T07:18:00.000Z	Ex-Cyber	BROKEN_LADDER	no, different apps can use the same codecs (hence "shared library")
