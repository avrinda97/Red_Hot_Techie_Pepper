2012-11-20T22:09:00.000Z	axgb123		and it sometimes  works, sometimes doesn't so that shows that drivers are not the problem
2012-11-20T22:09:00.000Z	axgb123		also this is a desktop computer and also i tried Wicd and the same problem was the case
2012-11-20T22:10:00.000Z	axgb123		but, for some reason, if i reboot into windows then reboot into ubuntu it starts working again. Very strange
2012-11-20T22:11:00.000Z	axgb123		no, it only works if i boot into windows then reboot into ubuntu. I have tried both and only the first works
2012-11-20T22:13:00.000Z	axgb123		but it also does not work with wicd so how can it be drivers
2012-11-20T22:13:00.000Z	axgb123		either when i boot up it works with both wicd and default network manager, or it works with neither. SO it cant be a drivers problem
2012-11-20T22:14:00.000Z	axgb123		what should i try doing. ive tried almost everything but ive always had this same problem
2012-11-20T22:14:00.000Z	axgb123		but it works almost perfectly on winows 7 when it ius booted into
2012-11-20T22:15:00.000Z	axgb123		its a tplink and it has an atheros chipset
2012-11-20T22:16:00.000Z	axgb123		what should i do? im not expert. ive tried all sorts of crazy things to try and get it to work
2012-11-20T22:17:00.000Z	theadmin	axgb123	Is ath9k loaded?
2012-11-20T22:17:00.000Z	axgb123		what do it do? sudo apt-get install ath9k?
2012-11-20T22:17:00.000Z	axgb123		i dont know if it is installed or loaded
2012-11-20T22:17:00.000Z	axgb123		or whatever
2012-11-20T22:17:00.000Z	theadmin	axgb123	Eh, no, just check if it's loaded: lsmod | grep ath
2012-11-20T22:18:00.000Z	axgb123		im on ubuntu, and it just happens to be working now, as i said it sometimes does and sometimes does not
2012-11-20T22:18:00.000Z	theadmin	axgb123	Sounds sort of random, I dunno. Try updating your system, may be a bug that's fixed in a new release

2012-11-20T22:19:00.000Z	axgb123	theadmin	ive updated, ive coped with the problem since about 11.10 when i started using ubuntu *A lot*
2012-11-20T22:19:00.000Z	axgb123		this is what came out of the terminal :ath9k                 131308  0  mac80211              539908  1 ath9k ath9k_common           14055  1 ath9k ath9k_hw              395218  2 ath9k,ath9k_common ath                    23827  3 ath9k,ath9k_common,ath9k_hw cfg80211              206566  3 ath9k,mac80211,ath
2012-11-20T22:20:00.000Z	theadmin	axgb123	Hm, looks good to me... But then again it *is* working now so that's no surprise
