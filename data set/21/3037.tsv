2009-06-29T21:21:00.000Z	ksc654		Hello, I volunteer as a sysadmin for a small private school. I'm looking for a way to setup remote access for teachers and students. Any suggestions?
2009-06-29T21:22:00.000Z	mbeierl1	ksc654	vinagre / vino-server - these are VNC-based "remote desktop sharing" software for Linux/Ubuntu
2009-06-29T21:23:00.000Z	mbeierl1	ksc654	either that or you can use XDCMP, but that requires you to then use an X server on the client and if the client is Windows, that's not super easy - although can be done free of cost

2009-06-29T21:25:00.000Z	ksc654	mbeierl1	I
2009-06-29T21:27:00.000Z	ksc654	mbeierl1	I've only recently setup a linux server for the computer lab. Its running LTSP and the workstations are using pxe. I set it up over the weekend.
2009-06-29T21:28:00.000Z	mbeierl1	ksc654	edubuntu?
2009-06-29T21:29:00.000Z	mbeierl1	ksc654	join #edubuntu or #ltsp as well if you've got questions around those... might get more specific answers than here which is general desktop support
2009-06-29T21:31:00.000Z	ksc654	mbeierl1	What I'm really looking for is vpn access for teachers and home directory access for students.
2009-06-29T21:33:00.000Z	mbeierl1	ksc654	Ah!  Different beast altogether :) If you are running from a mixed (linux/windows) set of clients, PPTP is probably the easiest and best vpn for you to set up.  Check out  pptpd (PoPToP Point to Point Tunneling Server)
2009-06-29T21:34:00.000Z	ksc654	mbeierl1	Thanks for the info.
2009-06-29T21:34:00.000Z	mbeierl1	ksc654	I actually use my school's Win2k3 server to act as radius server and run VPN from that, but can be done many different ways, including as I just suggested having the VPN server be linux running PPTP server software
2009-06-29T21:35:00.000Z	mbeierl1	ksc654	are you supporting a heterogeneous school network or are all the computers using Linux?
2009-06-29T21:36:00.000Z	ksc654	mbeierl1	Its mixed right now. The computer lab was the first of many steps to migrate away from Windows.
2009-06-29T21:36:00.000Z	mbeierl1	ksc654	do you have a domain controller?
2009-06-29T21:38:00.000Z	ksc654	mbeierl1	Yes. W2k3. Its overburdened. Its the PDC, http, dns, gateway and file server right now.
2009-06-29T21:38:00.000Z	mbeierl1	ksc654	as part of a "gentle" migration away from Windows, I'd suggest looking at Likewise Open version 5 (aptitude search likewise-open) to allow the linux machines to authenticate against the Windows Domain
2009-06-29T21:38:00.000Z	ksc654	mbeierl1	I had stumbled across that over the weekend.
2009-06-29T21:39:00.000Z	mbeierl1	ksc654	it works well, and I've got it working for me (at work I am part of the domain with my linux laptop)
2009-06-29T21:41:00.000Z	mbeierl1	ksc654	I'd recommend replacing the PDC with a linux firewall as a first step to overall network changes.  Have it connect to the internet, and allow the PDC to do everything else it currently does
2009-06-29T21:42:00.000Z	mbeierl1	ksc654	if the PDC HTTP server is external as well as internal, you then need some firewall rules to do port forwarding, but that is easy.
