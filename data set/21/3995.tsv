2008-08-29T02:13:00.000Z	DavidCanarias		Can anyone help translate what the following error means please ?  Internal error on browser end: Pipe closed during read?
2008-08-29T02:14:00.000Z	DavidCanarias		Can anyone help me debug a program please?
2008-08-29T02:16:00.000Z	DavidCanarias		My terminal tells me to debug my program, run it with the --sync command line? How do I do that?????
2008-08-29T02:16:00.000Z	qr	DavidCanarias	programname --sync
2008-08-29T02:17:00.000Z	qr	DavidCanarias	indeed you do
2008-08-29T02:18:00.000Z	qr	DavidCanarias	no you use the name of your program's executable.
2008-08-29T02:19:00.000Z	qr	DavidCanarias	a program is an executable file, as in a file with commands for your computer, you need to type the name of that file then --sync
2008-08-29T02:19:00.000Z	qr	DavidCanarias	what program are you trying to run
2008-08-29T02:20:00.000Z	qr	DavidCanarias	so it was firefox that crashed?
2008-08-29T02:22:00.000Z	qr	DavidCanarias	that's what it's supposed to do.  ( debugging is generally not an automatic thing, you need to know what your are doing )
2008-08-29T02:23:00.000Z	qr	DavidCanarias	That's not meant as a disparagement, it's unlikely many people really know what they're doing when it comes to debugging firefox. (outside of the devs themselves that is)
2008-08-29T02:24:00.000Z	qr	DavidCanarias	debugging a program usually requires some pretty specialized knowledge about the particular program
2008-08-29T02:27:00.000Z	qr	DavidCanarias	debugging is a process, not something you do with a single command.  If debugging was just a command then all programs would ship with a --no-bugs option.
2008-08-29T02:27:00.000Z	qr	DavidCanarias	--sync probably just makes the debugging process simpler if you already know what you're doing.
2008-08-29T02:29:00.000Z	qr	DavidCanarias	You can read about debuggers, like gdb for example, which are programs that you can use to watch other programs execute.  Apart from that debugging is really just: "know what the program is supposed to do" "watch it do something else" "figure out why" ... in a general sense anyway.
2008-08-29T02:30:00.000Z	qr	DavidCanarias	it usually requires you know a good deal about the internal workings of the program you are trying to debug
2008-08-29T02:30:00.000Z	qr	DavidCanarias	cheers
2008-09-04T03:15:00.000Z	qr	DavidCanarias	--sync looks like a command line option to some program... but you haven't said which one.
2008-09-04T03:18:00.000Z	qr	DavidCanarias	what program though?
2008-09-04T03:18:00.000Z	qr	DavidCanarias	I'm guessing firefox ??
2008-09-04T03:20:00.000Z	qr	DavidCanarias	well if you don't know what program it is there's not much you can do.  Try firefox --sync, although that's really not going to help anything on its own.
