2005-01-15T15:19:00.000Z	TUXIE		I'm trying to tell u that but the install is all F##ked up!
2005-01-15T15:21:00.000Z	TUXIE		1 cd right.. Bios boots from cd bah blah burned from ISO ... 95% thru the install it asks for the 2nd CD .. only one go figure... ?
2005-01-15T15:23:00.000Z	TUXIE		Back to Suze DVD... 3'5 Gigabyte install without a hitch! compare that to Ubuntu's 700 mb ..maybe 1.5 gig install! :->
2005-01-15T15:24:00.000Z	TUXIE		Okay what do u get with Ubuntu ..2.6 kernal ..KDE 3.2?
2005-01-15T15:24:00.000Z	TUXIE		No Gnome 2.8?
2005-01-15T15:24:00.000Z	Gwildor|Work	TUXIE	gnome 2.8 .........kernal 2.6 something
2005-01-15T15:25:00.000Z	Gwildor|Work	TUXIE	yes
2005-01-15T15:33:00.000Z	Gwildor|Work	TUXIE	whats the intall problem?
2005-01-15T15:34:00.000Z	TUXIE	Gwildor|Work	It keeps asking for the second CD tho it was a single CD ISO burn instaltion!!!!!
2005-01-15T15:34:00.000Z	Gwildor|Work	TUXIE	sensebend  ive never had that happen...on 4th install
2005-01-15T15:36:00.000Z	Gwildor|Work	TUXIE	well, im pretty sure all of here isntalled from the same version, less it was from debian
2005-01-15T15:36:00.000Z	Gwildor|Work	TUXIE	maybe just a bad burn......i doubt it, but you never know
2005-01-15T15:37:00.000Z	TUXIE	Gwildor|Work	Bad burn would trash the installation completely .. this sounds like some kind of screwup with the particular distro? ;-<
2005-01-15T15:38:00.000Z	Gwildor|Work	TUXIE	what i am saying is, i dont think there has been any changes to the iso, since warty was final...so either we all have the problem.......or it is something to do with YOUR disk
2005-01-15T15:41:00.000Z	TUXIE	Gwildor|Work	.. fair enough... :-<
2005-01-15T15:44:00.000Z	Gwildor|Work	TUXIE	i am
