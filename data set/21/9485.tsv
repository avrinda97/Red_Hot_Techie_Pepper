2007-04-09T09:41:00.000Z	Linux_Galore		hmm, theres an idea, a safe root login that stop you doing stupid things
2007-04-09T09:41:00.000Z	Linux_Galore		rm -rf /  Not allowed please type another command
2007-04-09T09:41:00.000Z	Flannel	Linux_Galore	There is.  It's called normal user accounts.
2007-04-09T09:42:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	Flannel	yeah but you want to let them edit file but not delete whole system directories
2007-04-09T09:42:00.000Z	Flannel	Linux_Galore	Editing is deleting.
2007-04-09T09:45:00.000Z	Flannel	Linux_Galore	if you want, you can customize sudo to allow users to say, run nano, but not rm.
2007-04-09T09:46:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	Flannel	yes but normal people cant do this
2007-04-09T09:46:00.000Z	Flannel	Linux_Galore	eh?  Your administrator would have to set it up.
2007-04-09T09:47:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	Flannel	yes some 40 something mother with kids has an on hand admin
2007-04-09T09:47:00.000Z	Flannel	Linux_Galore	Oh.  You mean normal people can't set it up?  Right.  But normal people don't usually have to worry about multiple accounts and having to have a tiered permission system.
2007-04-09T09:48:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	Flannel	yes but normal people read howto and do typos thus wrecking the install
2007-04-09T09:48:00.000Z	Flannel	Linux_Galore	with the technically uninclined you cited, you wouldn't ever get them to figure out which hoops to jump through to remove the files they actually WANT to remove, if you disallowed that.
2007-04-09T09:49:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	Flannel	Im not saying they would intentionally do it, people make mistakes, especially those not familair with the system
2007-04-09T09:50:00.000Z	Flannel	Linux_Galore	disallowing them to rm / isn't a mistake most people make.  Except when stupid people try and trick them nito it.  Since most people don't ever rm any sstem files, just edit them.
2007-04-09T09:51:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	Flannel	Im just saying when in sudo that there should be a command filter (that can be disabled by the none newbies) that warns them they are about to self destruct the system
2007-04-09T09:52:00.000Z	Flannel	Linux_Galore	this is getting offtopic, we could move to #ubuntu-offtopic if you'd like.  But, there are an infinite number of ways to 'ruin' a system, and an infinite number of close ones that are perfectly normal and harmless.  The overhead for that sort of thing would be enormous and relatively pointless.
2007-04-09T09:53:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	Flannel	Ive actually seen a user use sudo and remove all the file in the wrong directory, sudo didnt say a thing, it should have asked "you are about to delete 134 files are you sure [Y/n] "
2007-04-09T09:53:00.000Z	Flannel	Linux_Galore	#ubuntu-offtopic
2007-04-09T09:54:00.000Z	Flannel	Linux_Galore	no.  It's the appropriate channel for this discussion.
2007-04-09T09:55:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	Flannel	no its kills the topic because I cant watch two channels
2007-04-09T09:56:00.000Z	Flannel	Linux_Galore	just because you can't watch two channels doesn't give you permission to talk about whatever you want in this one
