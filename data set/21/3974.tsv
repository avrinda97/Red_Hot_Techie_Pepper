2009-05-22T13:12:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	ryanprior	some people take a while for this to sink in
2009-05-22T13:12:00.000Z	ryanprior	Paddy_EIRE	I'm feeling pretty patient. ;-)
2009-05-22T13:14:00.000Z	ryanprior	Paddy_EIRE	ccsm is the interface you use to edit Compiz's behaviour, though.
2009-05-22T13:15:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	ryanprior	yeah I have a feeling he is trying to make it shade the window
2009-05-22T13:15:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	ryanprior	which compiz cannot do
2009-05-22T13:15:00.000Z	ryanprior	Paddy_EIRE	That is not true, Emerald's code was merged into Compiz and Emerald is now antequated (except for a new off-shoot that's not mature yet)
2009-05-22T13:15:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	ryanprior	not on jaunty mate
2009-05-22T13:16:00.000Z	ryanprior	Paddy_EIRE	The shading thing might be left out of Compiz, I'll trust you on that one; but going back to a buggy Emerald WM is probably not worth it IMHO.
2009-05-22T13:16:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	ryanprior	if you locate the option to shade windows in compiz then please share it with the rest of us ;)
2009-05-22T13:17:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	ryanprior	and I agree emerald is just plain buggy
2009-05-22T13:17:00.000Z	ryanprior	Paddy_EIRE	I'm not an expert on all the plugins, but I'd imagine that if shading was part of Emerald, it's probably part of the optional Fusion plugin package now.
2009-05-22T13:17:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	ryanprior	hmm.. good point
2009-05-22T13:21:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	ryanprior	To change the behaviour for gtk-window-decorator, open gconf-editor and change /apps/metacity/general/action_double_click_titlebar to "toggle_shade".
2009-05-22T13:21:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	ryanprior	compiz does not interface with that yet
2009-05-22T13:21:00.000Z	ryanprior	Paddy_EIRE	Interesting. I dislike shaded windows myself, but for those who like that behaviour it's nice to know it's in gconf.
2009-05-22T13:22:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	ryanprior	yeah nor do I
2009-05-22T13:22:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	ryanprior	gotta love gconf :-)
2009-05-22T14:04:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	ryanprior	no it cant.. the virus cant go anywhere but the virtual drive space
2009-05-22T14:05:00.000Z	ryanprior	Paddy_EIRE	That's true, but what's the big difference?
2009-05-22T14:05:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	ryanprior	well that was not his question
2009-05-22T14:06:00.000Z	ryanprior	Paddy_EIRE	I would say that a PC running GNU/Linux and Windows, with Windows being infected, is just as bad as running Windows period. Moral of this story: don't use Windows.
