2012-05-03T18:07:00.000Z	amel		need help
2012-05-03T18:07:00.000Z	gaelfx	amel	describe your problme
2012-05-03T18:12:00.000Z	gaelfx	amel	deb is not a command, perhaps you want dpkg?
2012-05-03T18:13:00.000Z	gaelfx	amel	then you need to click on the second link in the message ubottu has sent to you
2012-05-03T18:16:00.000Z	gaelfx	amel	the easiest way right now would be for you to do a fresh install of an Ubuntu release that is still supported
2012-05-03T18:17:00.000Z	gaelfx	amel	download an iso for 11.04, 11.10 or 12.04 and install it via CD or USB
2012-05-03T18:25:00.000Z	gaelfx	amel	is there any reason you want to update to 11.04 instead of 12.04?
2012-05-03T18:26:00.000Z	gaelfx	amel	have you checked the md5 of the iso you downloaded?
2012-05-03T18:35:00.000Z	gaelfx	amel	did you check the md5?
2012-05-03T18:36:00.000Z	gaelfx	amel	ok, let's start over. Are you using a CD or a USB?
2012-05-03T18:37:00.000Z	gaelfx	amel	to do a fresh install, you need to either burn the iso tp a CD or use the USB startup disk creator to copy it to a USB
2012-05-03T18:40:00.000Z	gaelfx	amel	did you put the ISO on a CD or USB after you downloaded it?
2012-05-03T18:41:00.000Z	gaelfx	amel	putting it "in" your hard disk won't do anything, it's needs to be on a CD or USB, otherwise you would be installing it on the same media you're booting it from which causes problems
2012-05-03T18:43:00.000Z	gaelfx	amel	is this separate hard disk booting before the hard disk on which you want to install? also, you can't put the iso on an NTFS drive, I think it needs to be FAT formatted
2012-05-03T18:43:00.000Z	amel	gaelfx	yes i think thats the problem thanks alot :)
2012-05-03T18:43:00.000Z	gaelfx	amel	I hope it works out for you
2012-05-03T18:44:00.000Z	amel	gaelfx	when i fat format it what should i do after that?
2012-05-03T18:44:00.000Z	gaelfx	amel	use the USB startup disk creator on the drive. You should be able to format it using the startup disk creator
2012-05-03T18:45:00.000Z	amel	gaelfx	Thanks alot :)
2012-05-03T18:45:00.000Z	gaelfx	amel	no problem
