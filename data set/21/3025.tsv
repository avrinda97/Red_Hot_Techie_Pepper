2009-08-16T12:33:00.000Z	livingdaylight		question: i've installed samba to allow my two ubuntu machines to share folders
2009-08-16T12:34:00.000Z	Ghoti	livingdaylight	that's a statement.
2009-08-16T12:37:00.000Z	Ghoti	livingdaylight	is there a reason you're wanting to use samba to share between two Linux boxen rather than, say, NFS or SSHFS?
2009-08-16T12:37:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Ghoti	because that is what was recommended
2009-08-16T12:38:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Ghoti	also when i right-click on a folder and choose share option Ubuntu automatically installs and uses samba
2009-08-16T12:39:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Ghoti	any ideas?
2009-08-16T12:39:00.000Z	Ghoti	livingdaylight	Wish I could help, but I haven't set up Samba in a long time
2009-08-16T12:39:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Ghoti	if you right click on a folder and want to share it installs samba
2009-08-16T12:40:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Ghoti	i should just be able to go to other box - and i do see the folder - mount it and access files, but it refuses passwords
2009-08-16T12:40:00.000Z	Ghoti	livingdaylight	Yes, but I don't use Samba, I use NFS, so my ability to assist you with Samba troubles will be limited :-/
2009-08-16T12:41:00.000Z	Ghoti	livingdaylight	if you are connectinb from box A to box B, use login credentials from box B, not A.
2009-08-16T12:42:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Ghoti	yes, that is what i'm doing
2009-08-16T12:43:00.000Z	Ghoti	livingdaylight	I'm afraid that's all the Samba advice I have :(
2009-08-16T12:51:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Ghoti	do you think samba needs to be installed on one or both systems?
2009-08-16T12:52:00.000Z	Ghoti	livingdaylight	the server needs to be installed on the machine hosting the files; the client on the one requesting the files from the server
2009-08-16T12:52:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Ghoti	so if i want both systems to be able to access one another, both would need samba?
2009-08-16T12:53:00.000Z	Ghoti	livingdaylight	both would need both the server and the client
2009-08-16T12:53:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Ghoti	if both machines havce the same username - could that cause a conflict?
2009-08-16T12:53:00.000Z	Ghoti	livingdaylight	I don'e see how
2009-08-16T12:54:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Ghoti	just grasping at straws
