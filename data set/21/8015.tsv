2006-06-24T16:39:00.000Z	Bassetts		Morning, my pc has been a bit weird over about the past 2 days, startup is taking longer and the time it takes GDM to start is considerably longer, and just now on this boot i got "filestystem has been mounted more than 30 times without being checked"
2006-06-24T16:39:00.000Z	Bassetts		Any ideas why at all?
2006-06-24T16:40:00.000Z	hyphenated	Bassetts	and you think that message has something to do with your gdm problem?
2006-06-24T16:41:00.000Z	Bassetts	hyphenated	i have no idea, i mean it just hung for a few seconds while i removed openssh-server, it never did that before
2006-06-24T16:43:00.000Z	hyphenated	Bassetts	open a terminal, run the command 'dmesg' and put all of the output in a pastebin

2006-06-24T16:45:00.000Z	hyphenated	Bassetts	it's more likely to be related to vmware than anything else
2006-06-24T16:45:00.000Z	hyphenated	Bassetts	it means exactly what it says
2006-06-24T16:45:00.000Z	Bassetts	hyphenated	well it was working fine till someone in here told me to stop vmware while trying to write dvds/cds
2006-06-24T16:46:00.000Z	Bassetts	hyphenated	then the result of that was "non-contigous 13.1%" or something like that, it had them words
2006-06-24T16:49:00.000Z	Bassetts	hyphenated	ok, i think my problems have something to do with gnomebaker and vmware
2006-06-24T16:49:00.000Z	Bassetts	hyphenated	that was on my /home partition
2006-06-24T16:49:00.000Z	hyphenated	Bassetts	yeah. I don't think you should worry about the drive that much.
2006-06-24T16:50:00.000Z	Bassetts	hyphenated	ok, it started after i installed gnomebaker, stopped vmware, wrote a dvd, reset, started vmware
2006-06-24T16:51:00.000Z	hyphenated	Bassetts	and now you're having "slowness" problems?
2006-06-24T16:52:00.000Z	Bassetts	hyphenated	the gdm splash normal gets up to the third icon "nautilus" then goes now i get about 2-3 even 4 more icons, after the login screen takes around 30 seconds to come up
2006-06-24T16:55:00.000Z	Bassetts	hyphenated	should i try removing gnomebaker and restart see how it goes?
2006-06-24T16:56:00.000Z	hyphenated	Bassetts	worth a try. I don't use gnome or gnomebaker so I can't help that much. The message when you boot though, has nothing to do with your problem. which is useful to know
2006-06-24T16:56:00.000Z	Bassetts	hyphenated	ok ill try that
2006-06-24T05:02:00.000Z	Bassetts	hyphenated	no difference :(
2006-07-02T15:48:00.000Z	hyphenated	Bassetts	or stop using an editor that creates files with those names
