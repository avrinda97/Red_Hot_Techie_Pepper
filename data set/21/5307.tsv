2007-11-14T23:02:00.000Z	VertexOfLife	marybuntu_	Okay
2007-11-14T23:02:00.000Z	VertexOfLife	marybuntu_	Press alt+F2 and type compiz --replace
2007-11-14T23:03:00.000Z	VertexOfLife	marybuntu_	Compiz+OpenOffice is a bit buggy so you might need to uninstall openoffice-gnome. It will make openoffice look ugly, but it is necessary to avoid it crashing
2007-11-14T23:08:00.000Z	marybuntu	VertexOfLife	getting very strange behaviors, after i did alt/f2 and typed compiz --replace, my whole screen went blank and then i just got like the wallpaper up, no menus or anything showing, except the little lone cursor... i clicked it all over the desktop, and finally this screen came back up.... still no cube, tho, and still compiz manager doesn't appear in menu...\
2007-11-14T23:08:00.000Z	VertexOfLife	marybuntu_	it should appear under system->prefrences
2007-11-14T23:09:00.000Z	VertexOfLife	marybuntu_	What compiz --replace does is replaces metacity which is default with compiz
2007-11-14T23:09:00.000Z	marybuntu	VertexOfLife	nope, still not there ... this is a fresh install
2007-11-14T23:09:00.000Z	VertexOfLife	marybuntu_	So you can do metacity --replace to return to metacity
2007-11-14T23:10:00.000Z	marybuntu	VertexOfLife	huuuuhh???
2007-11-14T23:11:00.000Z	VertexOfLife	marybuntu_	If you press alt_f2 that makes another thing called Metacity with no Compiz. Compiz --replace does the reverse
2007-11-14T23:11:00.000Z	VertexOfLife	marybuntu_	That is alt+f2 and type metacity or compiz --replace
2007-11-14T23:12:00.000Z	marybuntu	VertexOfLife	so does that mean i just disabled compiz?
2007-11-14T23:12:00.000Z	VertexOfLife	marybuntu_	If you typed compiz --replace into alt+f2, no, you enabled it
2007-11-14T23:13:00.000Z	marybuntu	VertexOfLife	the last thing you told me to type was metacity --replace, so does that mean i disabled compiz?
2007-11-14T23:14:00.000Z	VertexOfLife	marybuntu_	Yes
2007-11-14T23:14:00.000Z	VertexOfLife	marybuntu_	When you want compiz to be re-enabled do the same thing and type comiz --replace
2007-11-14T23:14:00.000Z	VertexOfLife	marybuntu_	compiz, sorry.
2007-11-14T23:15:00.000Z	marybuntu	VertexOfLife	oh, well, this is mom's computer, better leave well enough alone, she has enough trouble just logging on ... lol
2007-11-14T23:15:00.000Z	VertexOfLife	marybuntu_	lol, I had to do the same with my parents
2007-11-14T23:16:00.000Z	marybuntu	VertexOfLife	ok, then, thanks, see yous all lata
