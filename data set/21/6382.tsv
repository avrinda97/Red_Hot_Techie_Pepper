2007-04-23T14:16:00.000Z	deCon	surviver	better to reboot into windows, or will wine work fine?
2007-04-23T14:16:00.000Z	surviver	deCon	well i used wine to emulate and from there i did that its same as in windows only it will update slower...
2007-04-23T14:17:00.000Z	deCon	surviver	thanks!
2007-04-23T14:17:00.000Z	surviver	deCon	for me it was the only reason to dualboot but i just deleted windows i can play it also with wine on linux its more work but it works great
