2010-09-17T22:03:00.000Z	drjo		hello im looking for software to delvier mathmatical papers, especially logic
2010-09-17T22:05:00.000Z	drjo		i need to be able to write text and logical symbols easily, and print to pdf
2010-09-17T22:05:00.000Z	drjo		is there anything like that out there for ubuntu?
2010-09-17T22:06:00.000Z	JoeMaverickSett	drjo	you could try Open Office Formula.
2010-09-17T22:08:00.000Z	drjo	JoeMaverickSett	is that a feature in openoffice writer?
2010-09-17T22:08:00.000Z	JoeMaverickSett	drjo	i think not. try finding it in Software Centre.
2010-09-17T22:09:00.000Z	drjo	JoeMaverickSett	it says its installed, so i guess it came with ubuntu default, going to see if i find it in any of the menus of writer :p
2010-09-17T22:10:00.000Z	JoeMaverickSett	drjo	for me i can just go to it by Applications > Office > Open Office Formula. :)
2010-09-17T22:11:00.000Z	drjo	JoeMaverickSett	did it come default?
2010-09-17T22:12:00.000Z	JoeMaverickSett	drjo	i don't think so. i think you have to install Open Office.org suite or something. i forgot. :)
2010-09-17T22:14:00.000Z	drjo	JoeMaverickSett	i found something called MainMenu under system preferences, it was set to be hidden by default, thanks for the help :)
2010-09-17T22:15:00.000Z	JoeMaverickSett	drjo	oh, that. i didn't think of it. hope you enjoy. :)
2010-09-17T22:21:00.000Z	drjo	JoeMaverickSett	how do i put the formulas made in OO math into writer ?
2010-09-17T22:22:00.000Z	JoeMaverickSett	drjo	i do not know that. I, myself haven't gone beyond more than OO Document. :)
2010-09-17T22:23:00.000Z	drjo	JoeMaverickSett	isnt writer the document thing? sorry, im abit confused, i need to put the formulas i make in math into a document
2010-09-17T22:23:00.000Z	JoeMaverickSett	drjo	try this http://user.services.openoffice.org/en/forum/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=2919
2010-09-17T22:24:00.000Z	JoeMaverickSett	drjo	i think that's what you are looking for. i think writer = document thingy. :)
2010-09-17T22:27:00.000Z	drjo	JoeMaverickSett	nice thats exactly what i was looking for, dont even need to go into math, it pops up a little formula shell at the bottom :)
2010-09-17T22:27:00.000Z	JoeMaverickSett	drjo	okie. i'm glad that helped you. :)
2010-09-17T22:27:00.000Z	drjo	JoeMaverickSett	but i guess i should tech myself latex at some point :p
2010-09-17T22:28:00.000Z	JoeMaverickSett	drjo	that's what i was thinking 2 days ago. :)
