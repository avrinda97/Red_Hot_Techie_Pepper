2006-06-06T10:16:00.000Z	Tobberoth		Yes
2006-06-06T10:17:00.000Z	Tobberoth		I don't understand why Windows won't boot >_< I haven't touched grub or windows
2006-06-06T10:17:00.000Z	Tobberoth		I just made some unpartitioned space into a partition
2006-06-06T10:18:00.000Z	Tobberoth		It does? The partition I created is at the end of the drive, windows is on the primary one..
2006-06-06T10:18:00.000Z	Tobberoth		Well, teach me how to reach the boot.ini then ^^ I hear you can mount NTSF if you're skilled
2006-06-06T10:19:00.000Z	Tobberoth		Hmm
2006-06-06T10:19:00.000Z	Tobberoth		I'll still need to write to it to fix the boot.ini right?
2006-06-06T10:20:00.000Z	Tobberoth		I don't have a floppy drive
2006-06-06T10:21:00.000Z	Tobberoth		Chavo, how do I use my ubuntu CD for it? I know how to boot into liveCD, but I don't know how to install grub from a liveCD OS
2006-06-06T10:22:00.000Z	Tobberoth		and grub-install will automatically find windows etc?
2006-06-06T10:23:00.000Z	profoXP	Tobberoth	yes
2006-06-06T10:23:00.000Z	profoXP	Tobberoth	the newest live (desktop) cd will have an icon on the desktop "Install"
2006-06-06T10:23:00.000Z	profoXP	Tobberoth	doubleclick it and you are off. be carefull at partiionaning if you dont know what you're doing
2006-06-06T10:23:00.000Z	Tobberoth		I know profoXP, but that installs the whole OS
2006-06-06T10:23:00.000Z	profoXP	Tobberoth	do you only want half the os ?
2006-06-06T10:23:00.000Z	profoXP		:)
2006-06-06T10:24:00.000Z	Tobberoth	profoXP	 I onlt want grub :9 I have the OS allready
2006-06-06T10:24:00.000Z	Tobberoth		Well, I'll go repair the windows install.. then hope for the best ^
2006-06-06T10:25:00.000Z	profoXP	Tobberoth	ooh, right.. i dont know if its possible with the ubuntu cd, but it should be possible with grub-install, my buddy phar0z is an expert with grub :) but he seems to be offline right now :(
2006-06-06T10:25:00.000Z	profoXP	Tobberoth	windows repair will fix the MBR but it will destroy grub anyway, so you can only boot windows, afaik
2006-06-06T10:26:00.000Z	Tobberoth	profoXP	I know.. but hopefully I can fix linux afterwards
