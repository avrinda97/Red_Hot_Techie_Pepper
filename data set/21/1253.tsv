2011-01-10T19:14:00.000Z	r1pp3rj4ck		I have a problem I've never met before... so the TAB auto-completion doesn't really work in the terminal on a fresh Kubuntu install
2011-01-10T19:14:00.000Z	sam-_-	r1pp3rj4ck	which terminal?
2011-01-10T19:15:00.000Z	r1pp3rj4ck	sam-_-	Konsole
2011-01-10T19:15:00.000Z	sam-_-	r1pp3rj4ck	is it working in the ttys?
2011-01-10T19:16:00.000Z	r1pp3rj4ck	sam-_-	yep, it does... actually somewhere it's working, but I can't auto-complete for example the installation packages on the Konsole, but I can on the ttys
2011-01-10T19:17:00.000Z	sam-_-	r1pp3rj4ck	so it's a problem with konsole then? is it running bash?
2011-01-10T19:17:00.000Z	sam-_-	r1pp3rj4ck	help|grep -i bash
2011-01-10T19:18:00.000Z	r1pp3rj4ck	sam-_-	uses bash, yes
2011-01-10T19:18:00.000Z	r1pp3rj4ck		*it uses bash
2011-01-10T19:18:00.000Z	r1pp3rj4ck	sam-_-	4.1.5
2011-01-10T19:19:00.000Z	sam-_-	r1pp3rj4ck	don't know about konsole. it might be that the tab key isn't redirected to the bash.
2011-01-10T19:19:00.000Z	sam-_-	r1pp3rj4ck	check keyboard settings and just to be sure try another terminal like xterm
2011-01-10T19:20:00.000Z	r1pp3rj4ck	sam-_-	it is redirected, because if it's working if I want to auto-complete a filename
2011-01-10T19:20:00.000Z	r1pp3rj4ck		but I check the xterm out
2011-01-10T19:21:00.000Z	r1pp3rj4ck	sam-_-	and it's working in xterm
2011-01-10T19:22:00.000Z	sam-_-	r1pp3rj4ck	so filename completion does work in konsole. in xterm every completion works (like package names)?
2011-01-10T19:22:00.000Z	sam-_-	r1pp3rj4ck	correct?
2011-01-10T19:22:00.000Z	r1pp3rj4ck	sam-_-	yep, it's correct... and also in the ttys works every completion
2011-01-10T19:23:00.000Z	sam-_-	r1pp3rj4ck	well that's very strange and i have no idea on how to fix this. maybe someone in the kubuntu channel knows
2011-01-10T19:23:00.000Z	r1pp3rj4ck	sam-_-	ok, thanks :)
