2007-07-06T05:30:00.000Z	seodoa		So I just installed Ubuntu on my boyfriend's computer, and, while I can connect to his router in the installation environment, I cannot connect in the newly installed desktop environment... In fact, I cannot even ping the router.  Both environments seem to use the same driver, and both environments use appropriate /etc/network/interfaces files... Anyone know what might be causing the problem?
2007-07-06T05:32:00.000Z	daan	seodoa	So it worked with the livecd but not with the installed version?
2007-07-06T05:33:00.000Z	seodoa	daan	that is right
2007-07-06T05:33:00.000Z	daan	seodoa	what does ifconfig say
2007-07-06T05:35:00.000Z	seodoa	daan	I can&t tell you exactly without a reboot... but it looked fine, except for the fact that it had not received an IP address from the router
2007-07-06T05:35:00.000Z	daan	seodoa	you can try a static ip
2007-07-06T05:35:00.000Z	daan	seodoa	with /etc/network/interfaces
2007-07-06T05:37:00.000Z	daan	seodoa	lol what brand
2007-07-06T05:37:00.000Z	daan	seodoa	e-tech or something?
2007-07-06T05:37:00.000Z	seodoa	daan	Buffalo.
2007-07-06T05:37:00.000Z	daan	seodoa	my best bet is just to try a static ip
2007-07-06T05:38:00.000Z	seodoa	daan	Thanks, I'll give it a try
2007-07-06T05:38:00.000Z	daan	seodoa	don't forget to do a /etc/init.d/networking restart
2007-07-06T05:38:00.000Z	daan	seodoa	when you change something in the interfaces file
2007-07-06T05:39:00.000Z	seodoa	daan	don't worry, despite what Jack might think, I know my way around a computer... and I'm not a girl.  Everyone knows there are no girls on the internet
2007-07-06T05:40:00.000Z	daan	seodoa	eum are you a girl or not :)
2007-07-06T05:41:00.000Z	daan	seodoa	if you're not and you have a boyfriend then that's fine with me :) i don't discriminate
2007-07-06T05:42:00.000Z	daan	seodoa	Logitech?
2007-07-06T05:43:00.000Z	daan	seodoa	lol
2007-07-06T05:43:00.000Z	daan	seodoa	I actually like Microsoft keyboard that's the only thing I'll accept from them
2007-07-06T06:02:00.000Z	seodoa	daan	That did the trick :D I'm surprised his router didn't through a tantrum
