2008-11-04T13:45:00.000Z	rww	Oprtz	you can use Wubi, or partition your hard drive. If you'd like to partition, the install CD will give you instructions on it during installation
2008-11-04T13:47:00.000Z	Oprtz	rww	i have 2 partion, with fat32, 30gb each, there is some data on the partions, is there any way that i can make 10gb partion for ubuntu and my data still on the partion?

2008-11-04T13:50:00.000Z	rww	Oprtz	You should be able to. The Ubuntu CD installer can resize FAT32 partitions without data loss.
2008-11-04T13:50:00.000Z	Oprtz	rww	 wow thats cool
2008-11-04T13:51:00.000Z	rww	Oprtz	Yeah, it is :). Some caveats: make sure you do backups before any major disk editing, including partitioning for Ubuntu. You may not be able to resize partitions if they're heavily defragmented or don't have enough free space. Resizing partitions may take a while, because a lot of data needs to be moved around.

2008-11-04T13:52:00.000Z	Oprtz	rww	 okie, thanks for the advice, will ubuntu correct the booting of 2 different OS, or dominate itself ?
2008-11-04T13:53:00.000Z	rww	Oprtz	Ubuntu Installer should detect that you have XP installed and add it to your grub menu
2008-11-04T13:53:00.000Z	Oprtz	rww	 so no need to worry , thats cool :)
2008-11-04T13:54:00.000Z	rww	Oprtz	The configuration file for grub is /boot/grub/menu.lst. That file's really well commented, so you should be able to do some basic tweaking without any problems :). Remember to run sudo update-grub after changing menu.lst.
2008-11-04T13:55:00.000Z	Oprtz	rww	 ahhh,  i am not that much good in lunux, i need to read some website first :P
2008-11-04T13:56:00.000Z	rww	Oprtz	try the GRUB how-tos, and just google for specific instructions. There's lots of grub documentation out there :)
2008-11-04T13:56:00.000Z	Oprtz	rww	 thanks dude! :)
2008-11-04T13:56:00.000Z	rww	Oprtz	I'm not at a graphical terminal right now, so I can't browse the web and find you specific ones :(

2008-11-04T13:57:00.000Z	rww	Oprtz	there are command-line IRC clients. They're pretty easy to use :)
