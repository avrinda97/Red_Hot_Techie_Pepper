2008-10-31T15:46:00.000Z	natalisushka		hi, please I need some help. My system broke for some reason while upgrading to 8.10 from 8.04. I want to enter the recovery mode to fix broken packages, but it needs internet. I have wired connection and wireless around me. How do I connect to either (I prefer wireless)? I tried enditing /etc/network/interfaces for the wired connection but didn't work. When i scan for wireless, how can I select it and enter the passp
2008-10-31T15:46:00.000Z	natalisushka		Anyother suggestions to connect to internet would be appriciaited
2008-10-31T15:47:00.000Z	macpo3	natalisushka	if you're having nm issues (sounds like you are) then use the wired connection to sort it
2008-10-31T15:48:00.000Z	macpo3	natalisushka	have you got a network icon in the system tray?
2008-10-31T15:49:00.000Z	natalisushka	macpo3	what is nm? And how can I configure the wired one? I am running ubuntu 8.04 from the Live CD now, and inetwork and internet were detected the moment I plugged it. but when i was in recovery mode I didn't seem to have connection when i plugged the wire! What can ido?
2008-10-31T15:49:00.000Z	natalisushka	macpo3	as I said, I want internet to work when I am in the recovery mode (which is only command line)
2008-10-31T15:49:00.000Z	macpo3	natalisushka	sorry, beyond my knowledge
2008-10-31T15:50:00.000Z	macpo3	natalisushka	I've done manual network config but only from the gui
2008-10-31T15:51:00.000Z	macpo3	natalisushka	I'd guess at ifconfig
2008-10-31T15:51:00.000Z	natalisushka	macpo3	I know! I don't know the proper steps that guarantee it
2008-10-31T15:52:00.000Z	macpo3	natalisushka	ok, well try opening a terminal from the livecd, find out what the ifconfig is under 8.04, then figure out the ifconfig command to manually recreate that under 8.10
2008-10-31T15:52:00.000Z	macpo3	natalisushka	start with "ifconfig eth0" in a terminal window from the livecd
2008-10-31T15:53:00.000Z	macpo3	natalisushka	that's the way I'd try and fix it
2008-10-31T15:56:00.000Z	natalisushka	macpo3	Ok, I am in terminal now and the list is there. I have access to the file system of the installed ubuntu, and I can change ifconfig accordingly! But I don't know what exactly must be written there
2008-10-31T15:58:00.000Z	macpo3	natalisushka	sorry - what I'm suggesting is that you use the "ifconfig" command from an 8.04 terminal to see what the interface params are, and then use it from the command line with those params when you're running the console recovery mode to manually set the interface up
2008-10-31T15:59:00.000Z	macpo3	natalisushka	I don't think you need to actually edit anything at the moment, you just need to figure out what commands to issue from the recovery console to turn ethernet / tcp/ip on
2008-10-31T16:00:00.000Z	natalisushka	macpo3	yes, i see, however, I want to be really certain of what I must type in the console of recovery mode so I may not switch back here for help if anything is missed
2008-10-31T16:00:00.000Z	natalisushka	macpo3	that's why I am here, to figure out with your help :)
2008-10-31T16:01:00.000Z	macpo3	natalisushka	ok, well I've never had to do this myself, I just know what I'd try if I had that problem
2008-10-31T16:02:00.000Z	natalisushka	macpo3	I guess I'll go to recovery now. I may be back soon! (hopefully not :))
2008-10-31T17:16:00.000Z	natalisushka	macpo3	Hey, it's me again (natalisushka) .. I didn't succeed :/
