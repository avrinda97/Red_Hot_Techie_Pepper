2009-08-26T03:33:00.000Z	Bor33D		i did have a question
2009-08-26T03:33:00.000Z	Bor33D		but nobody can help me with it
2009-08-26T03:33:00.000Z	cornet	Bor33D	try asking again
2009-08-26T03:35:00.000Z	cornet	Bor33D	ok - does "servers ip" mean "ip of tower PC"
2009-08-26T03:37:00.000Z	cornet	Bor33D	wrong way round - you need to port forward FROM your router TO your tower PC ... in a terminal do   ifconfig    to get the ip of the tower
2009-08-26T03:39:00.000Z	cornet	Bor33D	ifconfig lo   wil give you IP of 127.0.0.1     do ifconfig eth0
2009-08-26T03:39:00.000Z	cornet	Bor33D	lo == loopback interface, eth0 == network interface card
2009-08-26T03:43:00.000Z	cornet	Bor33D	ok, do you have DHCP enabled on your router ?
2009-08-26T03:43:00.000Z	cornet	Bor33D	time to enable it then :)
2009-08-26T03:43:00.000Z	cornet	Bor33D	it's generanlly an option on the configuration interface to your router ?
2009-08-26T03:44:00.000Z	cornet	Bor33D	if in doubt consult you routers documentation and see what it says
2009-08-26T03:44:00.000Z	Bor33D	cornet	what would you say if i said i chucked the doc book away?
2009-08-26T03:45:00.000Z	cornet	Bor33D	i'd say google for your router make/model and download the manual
2009-08-26T03:45:00.000Z	Bor33D	cornet	i could look it up on the internet? its just a standared netgear wireless router
2009-08-26T03:46:00.000Z	Bor33D	cornet	thank you for your help, i guess if i cant even get this sorted then i should just stay with my webhost?
