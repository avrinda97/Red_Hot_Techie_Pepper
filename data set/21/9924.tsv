2005-06-20T07:43:00.000Z	wijnand		is there a recommended method to resize a windows (ntfs) partition before installing ubuntu? i'm trying to set it up on a friends machine
2005-06-20T07:44:00.000Z	nalioth	wijnand	use partition magic from windoze, or wipe the system and start clean
2005-06-20T07:44:00.000Z	wijnand	nalioth	PM costs lots of money though, doesn't it?
2005-06-20T07:44:00.000Z	wijnand	nalioth	starting over is never a bad idea for windos though ;)
2005-06-20T07:44:00.000Z	nalioth	wijnand	yes it is a commercial product
2005-06-20T07:45:00.000Z	nalioth	wijnand	please don't ask me what to do with windoze.. .. (i'll tell ya every time to wave bye-bye)
2005-06-20T07:45:00.000Z	wijnand	nalioth	that's my normal strategy too :)
2005-06-20T07:45:00.000Z	nalioth	wijnand	just keep in mind re hornsby that ntfs writing is still considered 'unstable' under linux
2005-06-20T07:46:00.000Z	wijnand	nalioth	yeah i know
2005-06-20T07:47:00.000Z	nalioth	wijnand	then clean your friends HD, reinstall winduhs (using fat32 filessystem (for easier file sharing on the box)) and go from there
2005-06-20T07:47:00.000Z	nalioth	wijnand	i build/service/etc boxen, and i never install windoze on ntfs
2005-07-02T09:00:00.000Z	nalioth	wijnand	recommended to enable non official repos, only to get the program you are after, then disabling the repos
2005-07-02T09:00:00.000Z	wijnand	nalioth	yeah i understand that.. could get nasty otherwise :)
2005-07-02T09:01:00.000Z	nalioth	wijnand	just a standard observation i make to all folks (i don't know)
2005-07-02T09:01:00.000Z	wijnand	nalioth	wise -- probably saves having to deal with a lot of distressed people in here
2005-07-02T09:02:00.000Z	nalioth	wijnand	ya aint nevva lied
2005-07-02T09:17:00.000Z	nalioth	wijnand	but does loggin out restart x?
2005-07-02T09:16:00.000Z	wijnand	nalioth	or just logout and back in really :P
2005-07-13T16:24:00.000Z	nalioth	wijnand	at the time, its not recommended to do a full upgrade using BP
2005-07-13T16:24:00.000Z	nalioth	wijnand	it's advised to get the pkg(s) you want, and then comment BP out until next time
2005-07-13T16:24:00.000Z	wijnand	nalioth	so how do i prevent the update manager from looking in that repository?
