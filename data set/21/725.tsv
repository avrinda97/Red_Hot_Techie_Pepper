2011-12-19T10:35:00.000Z	nimbiotics		Hello evry1, I was once sent a link in this channel with instruction s on how to install 11.10 w/o unity. Can some1 plz point me to this link?
2011-12-19T10:36:00.000Z	somsip	nimbiotics	you can use the minimal install CD, or one of the other flavours of Ubuntu, such as Xubuntu
2011-12-19T10:38:00.000Z	nimbiotics	somsip	I'm not sure i wan to change 2 another flavor, but I have considewred it; Unity suckcs big time
2011-12-19T10:38:00.000Z	somsip	nimbiotics	so you've already installed?
2011-12-19T10:39:00.000Z	nimbiotics	somsip	oh yes, but I want to make a fresh  install now
2011-12-19T10:39:00.000Z	somsip	nimbiotics	so what are you looking to replace it with?
2011-12-19T10:40:00.000Z	nimbiotics	somsip	gnome3? I dnt know; whatever is closer to last version and that would allow me to use compiz, which I love. Any suggestions?
2011-12-19T10:41:00.000Z	somsip	nimbiotics	but with this, you wouldn't uninstall unity. Just not use it
2011-12-19T10:42:00.000Z	nimbiotics	somsip	THX, what is the point of having it if I dnt plan on using Unity? Can I just get rid of Unity completely? TIA
2011-12-19T10:43:00.000Z	somsip	nimbiotics	I believe it's pretty integral to a base install, which is where I started with my first point - reinstall a version that does not use a standard install
2011-12-19T10:43:00.000Z	nimbiotics	somsip	u lost me; what do u mean?
2011-12-19T10:44:00.000Z	somsip	nimbiotics	if you use a minimal install, then install gnome-shell or gnoma-panel, you might avoid the unity packages. Dunno. I don't use gnome
2011-12-19T10:44:00.000Z	nimbiotics	somsip	what do u use? xubuntu u said?
2011-12-19T10:44:00.000Z	somsip	nimbiotics	minimal install and Awesome WM
2011-12-19T10:45:00.000Z	nimbiotics	somsip	WM?
2011-12-19T10:46:00.000Z	somsip	nimbiotics	Windown Manager
2011-12-19T10:46:00.000Z	nimbiotics	somsip	got it
2011-12-19T10:46:00.000Z	nimbiotics	somsip	never heard of it
2011-12-19T10:51:00.000Z	nimbiotics	somsip	MahaVishnu, HaxRPG, THX a lot for your insight(s)!
2011-12-19T10:51:00.000Z	somsip	nimbiotics	np. Happy to help get someone off unity
2011-12-19T10:51:00.000Z	nimbiotics	somsip	lmao!
