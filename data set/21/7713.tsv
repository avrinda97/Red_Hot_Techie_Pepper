2006-08-13T15:45:00.000Z	JamieBE		Is there a way that I can just forget all the XGL stuff and revert back to a working X for my Nvidia card?
2006-08-13T15:45:00.000Z	JamieBE		I ahve it running at the moment but when I go into stuff the like penguin racer, it is IMPOSSIBLY slow and laggy
2006-08-13T15:47:00.000Z	JamieBE		Ti4200 128MB I think
2006-08-13T15:49:00.000Z	JamieBE		I think my xserver is working OK, It's just very laggy for some reason, it used to be like this on the LiveCD, any ideas, anyone? Help would be greatly appreciated.
2006-08-13T15:51:00.000Z	JamieBE		sTILL AN INVALID OP.
2006-08-13T15:52:00.000Z	JamieBE		I'll remove XGL through Synaptic and see what that does.
2006-08-13T15:52:00.000Z	JamieBE		#ubuntu-xgl wasn't any help i'm 'fraid. it was dead room.
2006-08-13T15:53:00.000Z	JamieBE		I am actually using xserver now
2006-08-13T15:53:00.000Z	JamieBE		But when i restart, x fails to load, and then the terminal gives me some lip about not being able to load. and then I have to redo the config x thing all over again
2006-08-13T15:55:00.000Z	JamieBE		Is there a way of configuring refresh rate in x?
2006-08-13T15:56:00.000Z	DarkElf109	JamieBE	In /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-08-13T15:56:00.000Z	DarkElf109	JamieBE	Well, first things first...BACK UP YOUR XORG.CONF!
2006-08-13T15:57:00.000Z	DarkElf109	JamieBE	Did you make a backup?
2006-08-13T15:58:00.000Z	JamieBE	DarkElf109	If I was that smart to make a backup in the first place, I wouldnt be here :p
2006-08-13T15:58:00.000Z	DarkElf109	JamieBE	Heh. Alright. I doubt it's a framerate problem, but, lets see something
2006-08-13T15:58:00.000Z	DarkElf109	JamieBE	Can you run glxgears, and give me a framerate?
2006-08-13T16:00:00.000Z	DarkElf109	JamieBE	Should echo to the console every 5 seconds...
2006-08-13T16:01:00.000Z	JamieBE	DarkElf109	: nope, just a picture of the gears moving VERY choppy
2006-08-13T16:05:00.000Z	DarkElf109	JamieBE	Your best bet would be to try the forums now
2006-08-13T16:08:00.000Z	DarkElf109	JamieBE	Hrm...Could even be correct...
2006-08-13T16:09:00.000Z	DarkElf109	JamieBE	Like I said, post to the forum. Give as much detail as you can (xorg.conf, that framerate, full story, etc.), and hopefuly, someone that knowsmore than I will stumble upon it...
