2008-11-09T03:13:00.000Z	futurama140	ActionParsnip	  00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 82845G/GL[Brookdale-G]/GE Chipset Integrated Graphics Device (rev 01)
2008-11-09T03:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	futurama140	http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/ubuntu-63/intel-82845g-graphics-controller-352262/
2008-11-09T03:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	futurama140	seems to  use the i810 driver
2008-11-09T03:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	futurama140	which is installed by default
2008-11-09T03:17:00.000Z	futurama140	ActionParsnip	none of that support page makes any sense to me, im completely new to linux OSs, and im trying to learn but i cant do hardly anything with my screen res so low, is this a complicated problem to fix?
2009-03-04T16:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	futurama140	its not an ubuntu problem then is it
2009-03-04T16:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	futurama140	have you changed the master / slave jumpers on any of them
2009-03-04T16:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	futurama140	if they are PATA you will need one master and one slave on each controller
2009-03-04T16:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	futurama140	make sure each has power
2009-03-04T16:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	futurama140	try just having one CD drive for now, then add the others in slowly
2009-03-04T16:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	futurama140	are they PATA?
2009-03-04T16:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	futurama140	then i garuntee they will have a jumper on the back
2009-03-04T16:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	futurama140	to set master or slave
2009-03-04T16:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	futurama140	on one ribbon you have a master and a slave, if you have 2 masters or 2 slaves on a ribbon they will conflict and you wont see either
2009-03-04T16:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	futurama140	come to #ubuntu-offtopic
