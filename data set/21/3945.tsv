2008-08-15T04:35:00.000Z	weatherhead		the NSA could probably do it given 18 months
2008-08-15T04:35:00.000Z	weatherhead		ok well just revoke it, and start afresh
2008-08-15T04:36:00.000Z	weatherhead		slackware is a good choice if you want to spend all your time on linux deliberately breaking things just for the sadistic pleasure of spending days fixing them
2008-08-15T04:36:00.000Z	weatherhead		but then that is just my opinion
2008-08-15T04:38:00.000Z	weatherhead		it's worth knowing the very basics before you get into it
2008-08-15T04:39:00.000Z	weatherhead		ever
2008-08-15T04:39:00.000Z	weatherhead		except you
2008-08-15T04:40:00.000Z	weatherhead		but, word of warning, also make sure you have revoke certificates in a safe place, and set an expiry date on every key you make, especially if you export it to a keyserver
2008-08-15T04:41:00.000Z	weatherhead		so I do not know
2008-08-15T04:43:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	weatherhead	installing the kde libraries, takes about 2min, its not really an issue.. just like it wouldn't be an issue to install gnome libraries on KDE to run a Gnome app
2008-08-15T04:43:00.000Z	weatherhead	IndyGunFreak	I know, but still if it's the only Qt app you're gonna run
2008-08-15T04:43:00.000Z	weatherhead	IndyGunFreak	GPG is the kind of thing you want tightly integrated into your DE
2008-08-15T04:44:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	weatherhead	true, but if he likes that particular QT app, its nto a dealbreaker to install KDE libs.
2008-08-15T04:44:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	weatherhead	i didn't see him mentioning anything about GPG..
2008-08-15T04:44:00.000Z	weatherhead	IndyGunFreak	I know, but he doesn't "like that particular Qt app" he's never tried it
2008-08-15T04:45:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	weatherhead	?.. thats dlemco rattling about that, not kevin_123 (to my knowledge)
2008-08-15T04:45:00.000Z	weatherhead	IndyGunFreak	sorry IRC burnout. I'm a suse man we have like 4 lines every 2 hours to deal with :-P
2008-08-15T04:46:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	weatherhead	lol.
2008-08-15T05:00:00.000Z	weatherhead	IndyGunFreak	64-bit is great,
2008-08-15T05:00:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	weatherhead	i guess great is in the eye of the beholder, i found the hoop jumping ridiculous, and it wasn't "that" much faster than 32bit(barely noticeable to me)
2008-08-15T05:00:00.000Z	weatherhead	IndyGunFreak	I do a lot of audio/multimedia work, really found a massive boost in performance in some things
