2008-12-28T03:07:00.000Z	Schuenemann		!alsa
2008-12-28T03:08:00.000Z	Schuenemann		what package do I need for alsaconf?
2008-12-28T03:09:00.000Z	Slart	Schuenemann	alsaconf might not be used anymore.. not really sure.. what are you trying to do?
2008-12-28T03:09:00.000Z	Schuenemann	Slart	unop_I compiled a kernel myself and then I have no sound...
2008-12-28T03:11:00.000Z	Schuenemann	Slart	is that fixable?
2008-12-28T03:12:00.000Z	Slart	Schuenemann	I have no idea.. depends on what you did to the kernel, what kind of soundcard etc etc.. does your sound work with the normal kernel?
2008-12-28T03:12:00.000Z	Schuenemann	Slart	yeah
2008-12-28T03:13:00.000Z	Schuenemann	Slart	don't I have to modprobe the driver?
2008-12-28T03:13:00.000Z	Slart	Schuenemann	I'm not entirely sure what one have to do when using a self-compiled kernel.. sorry
2008-12-28T03:16:00.000Z	Schuenemann	Slart	you know how can I find my driver name, then?
2008-12-28T03:16:00.000Z	Slart	Schuenemann	not really.. I've never compiled a kernel of my own.. ask the channel
2008-12-28T03:28:00.000Z	Schuenemann	Slart	sorry to insist: why there is no alsaconf anymore?
2008-12-28T03:28:00.000Z	Slart	Schuenemann	I don't really know why they removed it.. I just remember looking for it myself some time ago when I was troubleshooting alsa.. a lot of howto's on the net mention it
2009-01-02T20:10:00.000Z	Schuenemann	Slart	why it isn't in the repos anymore?
2009-01-02T20:10:00.000Z	Slart	Schuenemann	oh.. my bad.. bitchx isn't in the repos anymore.. something about not being updated I think
2009-01-02T20:10:00.000Z	Slart	Schuenemann	I didn't expect ubottu to just give you the normal irc factoid, sorry
2009-01-02T20:10:00.000Z	Schuenemann	Slart	oh, well... compilation nightmare again
2009-01-02T20:12:00.000Z	Slart	Schuenemann	I've never used bitchx but I use irssi.. works nicely for me
2009-01-02T20:13:00.000Z	Schuenemann	Slart	I will try it. Thx
2009-01-02T20:16:00.000Z	Schuenemann	Slart	would you mind telling me how to switch channel windows?
2009-01-02T20:16:00.000Z	Slart	Schuenemann	one sec afk
