2007-02-11T15:51:00.000Z	_Tom_		Hey guys, quick Q
2007-02-11T15:51:00.000Z	_Tom_		What's the ethos on swap partitions/
2007-02-11T15:51:00.000Z	_Tom_		*?
2007-02-11T15:51:00.000Z	_Tom_		How big should it be?
2007-02-11T15:51:00.000Z	_Tom_		I have 1024MB of system memory.
2007-02-11T15:52:00.000Z	_Tom_		Ok thanks :)
2007-02-11T15:52:00.000Z	cafuego_	_Tom_	Up to around 1 GB *or* amountof ram + around 256Mb if you want to do hibernation (laptop)
2007-02-11T15:53:00.000Z	_Tom_	cafuego_	No, no hibernation :)
2007-02-11T15:53:00.000Z	cafuego_	_Tom_	a gb will be fine then
2007-02-11T15:53:00.000Z	_Tom_	cafuego_	Any difference on having the swap parition at the beginning or the end of the drive?
2007-02-11T15:54:00.000Z	cafuego_	_Tom_	nominally yes, slightly faster at one of those locations. But I can't remember which.
2007-02-11T15:54:00.000Z	_Tom_	cafuego_	Hehe, ok. I'll go find a google link.
2007-02-11T16:06:00.000Z	cafuego_	_Tom_	If you can, ditch reiserfs and go for ext3.
2007-02-11T16:07:00.000Z	_Tom_	cafuego_	I was under the impression ReiserFS was better than ext3?
2007-02-11T16:08:00.000Z	cafuego_	_Tom_	It's better than a garbage disposal, but only marginally.
2007-02-11T16:08:00.000Z	cafuego_	_Tom_	The main problem with reiser is that the recovery tools are either extremely immature or non-existent.
2007-02-11T16:10:00.000Z	_Tom_	cafuego_	I see, well, I'm going to stick to ext3.
2007-02-11T16:14:00.000Z	cafuego_	_Tom_	I'd plonk it at the end
2007-02-11T16:14:00.000Z	cafuego_	_Tom_	prevents boot issues on broken bioses
2007-02-11T16:20:00.000Z	cafuego_	_Tom_	Nah, Linux doesn't care about boot flags.
2007-02-11T16:20:00.000Z	cafuego_	_Tom_	it will be booted from the MBR
