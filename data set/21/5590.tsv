2012-09-04T19:16:00.000Z	usr13	Newtoubuntu	I feel your frustration, but you will do well to confine your comments to the issue at hand.
2012-09-04T19:17:00.000Z	usr13	Newtoubuntu	So your Desktop Enviornment is Unity?
2012-09-04T19:18:00.000Z	usr13	Newtoubuntu	What version of Ubuntu are you using?
2012-09-04T19:19:00.000Z	usr13	Newtoubuntu	You might want to try mplayer.
2012-09-04T19:19:00.000Z	usr13	Newtoubuntu	Have you tried mplayer?
2012-09-04T19:21:00.000Z	usr13	Newtoubuntu	Are you still here?
