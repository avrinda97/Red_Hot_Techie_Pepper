2006-01-12T09:20:00.000Z	yatesy		if anything it'll slow things down if your hard drive is constantly swapping
2006-01-12T09:21:00.000Z	yatesy		was just about to suggest that :)
2006-01-12T09:23:00.000Z	yatesy		that you might be able to get away with, if you run nothing else
2006-01-12T09:23:00.000Z	yatesy		but ubuntu is still not for you
2006-01-12T09:23:00.000Z	yatesy		!openoffice
2006-01-12T09:24:00.000Z	yatesy		:/
2006-01-12T09:26:00.000Z	yatesy		i thought openoffice 2 wasn't in the repositories? i had to install it from debs provided by a developer
2006-01-12T09:26:00.000Z	yatesy		i can't find the link again

2006-01-12T09:36:00.000Z	mwe	yatesy	oh it's in ubuntu, just found it
2006-01-12T09:36:00.000Z	mwe	yatesy	apt-cacher it was, indeed
2006-01-12T09:37:00.000Z	mwe	yatesy	in universe though
2006-01-12T10:59:00.000Z	mwe	yatesy	someone kept insisting root is disabled in ubuntu since the passwd man page defines disabled accounts as accounts with bogus hashed passwords :)
