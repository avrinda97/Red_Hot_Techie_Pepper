2005-07-31T13:32:00.000Z	pestilence	h08817	just ask
2005-07-31T13:33:00.000Z	pestilence	h08817	you could check the ndiswrapper's known hardware list
2005-07-31T13:33:00.000Z	h08817	pestilence	how can i do that?
2005-07-31T13:34:00.000Z	pestilence	h08817	http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page
2005-07-31T13:34:00.000Z	h08817	pestilence	thanks
2005-07-31T13:34:00.000Z	pestilence	h08817	but, the driver is the windows driver for your card.
2005-07-31T13:35:00.000Z	h08817	pestilence	well how do i find out which is the linux driver for it?
2005-07-31T13:35:00.000Z	pestilence	h08817	you use ndiswrapper to use the *windows* driver in linux.
2005-07-31T13:35:00.000Z	pestilence	h08817	using the linux driver doesn't require ndiswrapper
2005-07-31T13:36:00.000Z	pestilence	h08817	so download it off the internet
2005-07-31T13:36:00.000Z	h08817	pestilence	i need that driver on my linux machine because it doesn't have internet
2005-07-31T13:37:00.000Z	pestilence	h08817	http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/index.php/List#N
2005-07-31T13:39:00.000Z	h08817	pestilence	so i can go to netgear.com and download the driver on windows to disk
2005-07-31T13:40:00.000Z	h08817	pestilence	then i can just install it on linux?
2005-07-31T13:40:00.000Z	pestilence	h08817	sort of.  read the ndiswrapper documentation.  there are also some good howto's out there for ubuntu.  try looking in the forum.
2005-07-31T13:41:00.000Z	pestilence	h08817	try searching before you post
2005-07-31T13:41:00.000Z	pestilence	h08817	there are a *ton* of posts already about it, i guarantee it
