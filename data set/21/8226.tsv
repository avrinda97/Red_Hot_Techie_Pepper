2006-05-15T05:25:00.000Z	cge	fourat	ubotu won't help you much if you are a old debian user.
2006-05-15T05:19:00.000Z	cge	fourat	no!
2006-05-15T05:19:00.000Z	cge	fourat	I just did it and it worked out very badly.
2006-05-15T05:22:00.000Z	cge	fourat	Oh, I see. Are you asking about third party repositories for Debian? If so, then yes, they do work with ubuntu.
2006-05-15T05:22:00.000Z	cge	fourat	usually
2006-05-15T05:24:00.000Z	cge	fourat	universe ~ main, multiverse ~ non-free and contrib
2006-05-15T05:25:00.000Z	fourat	cge	hh why
2006-05-15T05:25:00.000Z	cge	fourat	because it won't relate to things you already know, like unstable and testing, etc. It can still be helpful, though.
2006-05-15T05:48:00.000Z	cge	fourat	are you running dapper?
2006-05-15T05:49:00.000Z	cge	fourat	?
2006-05-15T05:50:00.000Z	cge	fourat	It is in breezy-backports as postgresql-8.1.
2006-05-15T05:52:00.000Z	cge	fourat	mysql5 is only in dapper
2006-05-15T06:16:00.000Z	cge	fourat	which one? Do you mean network-manager?
2006-05-15T06:18:00.000Z	cge	fourat	then use add applet on the panel, and I think there is an applet like that.
2006-05-15T06:20:00.000Z	cge	fourat	It shows up as Network Monitor on my computer, but I'm running dapper.
