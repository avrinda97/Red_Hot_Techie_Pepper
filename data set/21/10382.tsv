2005-04-16T10:39:00.000Z	jordanau		speaking of sudo... is there a way to use sudo and it not mess up the tab feature in the console?
2005-04-16T10:41:00.000Z	bob2	jordanau	fix your shell
2005-04-16T10:41:00.000Z	bob2	jordanau	zsh tab-completes commands after the sudo fine
2005-04-16T10:43:00.000Z	bob2	jordanau	no, of course it does more than that
2005-04-16T10:43:00.000Z	jordanau	bob2	yeah i didn't know it was a shell, thanks
2005-04-16T10:45:00.000Z	jordanau	bob2	dont answer i am going to read the docs
2005-04-20T11:18:00.000Z	bob2	jordanau	or just actually ask a question someone can anser
2005-04-20T11:18:00.000Z	jordanau	bob2	take it easy, just a joke :-)
2005-04-20T11:25:00.000Z	bob2	jordanau	no, that would be terrible obnoxious
2005-04-20T11:25:00.000Z	bob2	jordanau	and you can configure your client to do that if you care and think it will help you answer other people's questions better
