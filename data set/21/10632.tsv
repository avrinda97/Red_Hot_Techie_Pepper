2007-04-07T11:02:00.000Z	Angelus		hey everyone, is anyone familiar with a program DVD Catalyst 2.4, if so is there a ubuntu alternative???
2007-04-07T11:03:00.000Z	Xenguy	Angelus	what is the prog's function?
2007-04-07T11:03:00.000Z	Xenguy	Angelus	IC
2007-04-07T11:07:00.000Z	Xenguy	Angelus	I don't use PDAs; I just use dvdrip to convert DVD format to AVIs.  Don't know more than that really on this topic
2007-04-07T11:08:00.000Z	Xenguy	Angelus	I hate windows -- no  :-)  That is linux, which is the channel you are in right now =)
2007-04-07T11:10:00.000Z	Xenguy	Angelus	it depends on what output format you want I expect (and you haven't mentioned that so far I think)
2007-04-07T11:11:00.000Z	Xenguy	Angelus	definitely...
2007-04-07T11:11:00.000Z	Xenguy	Angelus	DVD->AVI is akin to something like WAV->MP3
2007-04-07T11:13:00.000Z	Xenguy	Angelus	OK :-)  There are others too (like acidrip) but I found dvdrip to be quite nice (sane defaults) but just a bit fussy to configure initially (no biggie tho, just a little time and patience)
2007-04-07T11:13:00.000Z	Xenguy	Angelus	once it is setup it's pretty nice
2007-04-07T11:13:00.000Z	Angelus	Xenguy	it seems like a small program which is good I'm no dial up! lol
2007-04-07T11:14:00.000Z	Xenguy	Angelus	start the d/l and go to bed, it'll be done in the morning or before ;-)
2007-04-07T11:14:00.000Z	Xenguy	Angelus	I used to dist-upgrade that way and it worked just fine :-D
2007-04-07T11:15:00.000Z	Xenguy	Angelus	I know, it just reminded me of my dialup daze ;-)
2007-04-07T11:15:00.000Z	Xenguy	Angelus	yw
2007-04-07T11:16:00.000Z	Xenguy	Angelus	1:15am here <yawn>
2007-04-07T11:24:00.000Z	Angelus	Xenguy	it doesn't like copy protected DVD's
2007-04-07T11:25:00.000Z	Xenguy	Angelus	you will need that decryption routine prog...
2007-04-07T11:25:00.000Z	Xenguy	Angelus	 libccs...  can't remember the full name - anyone?
2007-04-07T11:27:00.000Z	Xenguy	Angelus	it may be 'libdvdcss2'
2007-04-07T11:29:00.000Z	Xenguy	Angelus	you need extra codecs that's all...
