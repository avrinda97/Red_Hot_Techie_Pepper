2005-10-10T15:00:00.000Z	mahangu		can i suspend x, go to shell and reload it? how?
2005-10-10T15:01:00.000Z	dooglus	mahangu	not CTL F7, ALT F7 to get back
2005-10-10T15:01:00.000Z	dooglus	mahangu	you can go to 6 different shells - with Ctl-Alt-F1 through Ctl-Alt-F6
2005-10-10T15:02:00.000Z	dooglus	mahangu	once you've 'escaped' X, all you need is Alt-F1, Alt-F2, etc.
2005-10-10T15:06:00.000Z	dooglus	mahangu	what's your fave console mail reader?
2005-10-10T05:37:00.000Z	dooglus	mahangu	"sudo -i"
2005-10-19T05:34:00.000Z	dooglus	mahangu	right-click it and say 'move'
2005-10-19T05:36:00.000Z	mahangu	dooglus	wont move :(
2005-10-19T05:36:00.000Z	dooglus	mahangu	is it 'locked to panel'?  if so, untick that
2005-10-19T05:36:00.000Z	mahangu	dooglus	if i delete it, can i add it to a panel again?
2005-10-19T05:37:00.000Z	dooglus	mahangu	sure.  but you should be able to move it.  you don't drag mind you - just right-click, click 'move', then let go of the mouse buttons and move the mouse pointer to the other panel
2005-10-19T05:38:00.000Z	dooglus	mahangu	you can add another one to the other panel before you delete the first one if you want - that way you'll not end up with none of them...
2005-10-19T05:38:00.000Z	mahangu	dooglus	how can i add
2005-10-19T05:38:00.000Z	dooglus	mahangu	right-click, add to panel
2005-10-19T05:38:00.000Z	mahangu	dooglus	and add what?
2005-10-19T05:39:00.000Z	dooglus	mahangu	add 'menu bar'
2005-10-19T05:39:00.000Z	dooglus	mahangu	or try adding 'main menu' instead.  it's the same, but takes up 10 times less screen space
2005-10-19T05:40:00.000Z	mahangu	dooglus	cool
2005-10-19T11:07:00.000Z	mahangu	dooglus	have you been informed of the plans to take over the world
2005-10-19T11:08:00.000Z	dooglus	mahangu	I missed that meeting.
