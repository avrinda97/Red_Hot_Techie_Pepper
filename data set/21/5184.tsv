2007-12-09T06:25:00.000Z	lovedeatm	pgdx	i am going to set up a server that does RTASS
2007-12-09T06:26:00.000Z	lovedeatm	pgdx	i need to know what kinda of setup to use (ie lamp) for such purposes (RTASS means audio streaming)
2007-12-09T06:26:00.000Z	pgdx	lovedeatm	Well ... icecast?
2007-12-09T06:27:00.000Z	pgdx	lovedeatm	Are you asking which distro to install, or what packages under Ubuntu?

2007-12-09T06:31:00.000Z	pgdx	lovedeatm	if you don't want Apache/Mysql/PHP, don't choose the LAMP. It depends what you want from your server. If you just wish to stream aufio from it, just apt-get install icecast and ices
2007-12-09T06:34:00.000Z	lovedeatm	pgdx	ok, do you kwhat a standard config would be? if not or if its to detailed dun worry about it
2007-12-09T06:34:00.000Z	pgdx	lovedeatm	Standard server install? Or regarding to the streaming stuff?
2007-12-09T06:35:00.000Z	lovedeatm	pgdx	standard server install
2007-12-09T06:35:00.000Z	pgdx	lovedeatm	No, unfortunately. But enough. SSH and all other needed GNU-utils. No GUI, though. So you need to know your way around the terminal
2007-12-09T06:36:00.000Z	pgdx	lovedeatm	Or, at least manage to apt-get install iceast2 ices / mpd
2007-12-09T06:37:00.000Z	pgdx	lovedeatm	and, btw, VLC can also stream, but I think, if you wanna set up a radio station, that icecast is more suited
2007-12-09T06:37:00.000Z	lovedeatm	pgdx	ok thanks
