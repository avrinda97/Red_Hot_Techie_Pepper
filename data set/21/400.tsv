2012-01-11T00:44:00.000Z	roy_oneric		Hi! How can I use the OLD classic gnome as root in ubuntu 11.10?
2012-01-11T00:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	roy_oneric	there is a how to on omgubuntu, you can rejig Gnome3 to look like Gnome2
2012-01-11T00:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	roy_oneric	again, there is a how to on omgubuntu
2012-01-11T00:49:00.000Z	roy_oneric	ActionParsnip	Can't find that on http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk. Can you just tell me how to do that?
2012-01-11T00:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	roy_oneric	http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/12/how-to-make-ubuntu-11-10-look-and-feel-like-gnome-2/
2012-01-11T00:51:00.000Z	roy_oneric	ActionParsnip	Does that say how to do that to the "root" account?
2012-01-11T00:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	roy_oneric	same difference, running the desktop as root is not advise, supported nor needed
2012-01-11T00:53:00.000Z	roy_oneric	ActionParsnip	If the "root" account was useless, there it would not exist in the first place.
2012-01-11T00:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	roy_oneric	its not useless
2012-01-11T00:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	roy_oneric	its just not needed, as sudo does all you need and running gui apps, especially web browsers and the X server is particularly foolish
2012-01-11T00:56:00.000Z	roy_oneric	ActionParsnip	I know about "sudo". I am just not happy with the looks. I am not using it on a production server, but merely as a tool for other purposes.
2012-01-11T00:56:00.000Z	roy_oneric	ActionParsnip	I don't even need the gui tools. But the ones present are crappy. So I want the old one
2012-01-11T01:02:00.000Z	roy_oneric	ActionParsnip	Any help?
2012-01-11T01:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	roy_oneric	or run LXDE or XFCE if you want lightweight :)
2012-01-11T01:20:00.000Z	roy_oneric	ActionParsnip	Is it at all possible to use the classic desktop on ubuntu 11.10?
2012-01-11T01:21:00.000Z	roy_oneric	ActionParsnip	I mean as root?
2012-01-11T01:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	roy_oneric	there is a hack, I told you about it earlier. If you like the Gnom2 smell then XFCE works well
2012-01-11T01:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	roy_oneric	the accout is moot
2012-01-11T01:22:00.000Z	roy_oneric	ActionParsnip	"moot"?
2012-01-11T01:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	roy_oneric	irrelevant, doesn't matter
2012-01-11T01:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	roy_oneric	instead of asking, you could have looked it up yourself...
