2008-01-20T13:48:00.000Z	Joe_	idyllic	removing the flash plugin seems to have helped
2008-01-20T13:49:00.000Z	Joe_	idyllic	mines been crashing on average at least once an hour... I'm hoping this did it
2008-01-20T13:49:00.000Z	Joe_	idyllic	no flash sucks.. .but better than freezing up randomly, heh
2008-01-20T13:50:00.000Z	idyllic	Joe_	lol, okay, i will hang around here till i hear further non-crash from you. thanks mate
2008-01-20T13:50:00.000Z	idyllic	Joe_	hope ur way work for us
2008-01-20T14:36:00.000Z	idyllic	Joe_	that's great =)
2008-01-20T14:36:00.000Z	idyllic	Joe_	gah... so i just go in /usr/bin/ then remove flash plugin no?
2008-01-20T14:37:00.000Z	idyllic	Joe_	locate libflashplayer.so then i got /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins also
2008-01-20T14:38:00.000Z	idyllic	Joe_	i got 3 in total, plus the opera one
2008-01-20T14:40:00.000Z	Joe_	idyllic	if you open flashplayer-installer in gedit you can see it puts it in /usr/lib/mozilla or /home/<user>/,mozilla/plugins
2008-01-20T14:41:00.000Z	idyllic	Joe_	thanks mate. Btw, do you happen to know how to get flash working in opera? I search high and low on internet. Non working so far
2008-01-20T14:42:00.000Z	Joe_	idyllic	It seems that flash installer from adobe can detect opera installs too
2008-01-20T14:43:00.000Z	idyllic	Joe_	well, it didn't work for me =(. Anyway, best of lurk if you find anything regarding to the flash
2008-01-20T14:44:00.000Z	idyllic	Joe_	Will look for you whenever i hop in the channel. You don't change nick and don't mind me pm you right?
2008-01-20T14:44:00.000Z	Joe_	idyllic	Hopefully it fixes your freeze up problems too... no flash sucks, but better than an unusable computer :P  Worst case we can hope 8.04 fixes the issue
2008-01-20T14:44:00.000Z	Joe_	idyllic	np, should be on this nick.
2008-01-20T14:45:00.000Z	idyllic	Joe_	thanks man.
2008-01-20T15:40:00.000Z	Joe_	idyllic	I lied... it did it again...
