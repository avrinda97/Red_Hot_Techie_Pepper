2010-02-23T15:25:00.000Z	uyjhgjhkg		@ Jordan_U
2010-02-23T15:26:00.000Z	uyjhgjhkg		First link is pointless, this is undelete not data recovery
2010-02-23T15:27:00.000Z	uyjhgjhkg		I want the rest of it to be 100%, YES we can access the filsystem to see unlinked data.
2010-02-23T15:27:00.000Z	uyjhgjhkg		I don't want fairies and goblins and magick and maybes
2010-02-23T15:28:00.000Z	uyjhgjhkg		"Though most pages in the InterNet state it is impossible to undelete such files, this is simply wrong" FFS, seriously? Shut up author. I want 3 senteces: this undeletes files. Here is download. This is command
2010-02-23T15:28:00.000Z	uyjhgjhkg		WHat is wrong with people?
2010-02-23T15:30:00.000Z	uyjhgjhkg		"The complete Changelog with the possibility to download all released versions opens in a new window when clicking this link. " rather than have "change log / download" as a link. Seriously. painful
2010-02-23T15:32:00.000Z	uyjhgjhkg		"In order to ensure that ext3 can safely resume an unlink after a crash, it actually zeros out the block pointers in the inode, whereas ext2 just marks these blocks as unused in the block bitmaps and marks the inode as "deleted" and leaves the block pointers alone. Your only hope is to "grep" for parts of your files that have been deleted and hope for the best."
2010-02-23T15:32:00.000Z	uyjhgjhkg		Wrong. "Dear interested person, to undelete a file, you need to grep for content in that file, here is how"
2010-02-23T15:32:00.000Z	ardchoille	uyjhgjhkg	kinda sounds futile
2010-02-23T15:33:00.000Z	uyjhgjhkg	ardchoille	I'll see, I think I can recover this. It is pointless having any file system without a recovery tool. It makes tools like shred redundant, it isn't worth anything
2010-02-23T15:33:00.000Z	ardchoille	uyjhgjhkg	deleting a file has nothing to do with security, it has to do with freeing up space that the system can use again
2010-02-23T15:34:00.000Z	uyjhgjhkg	ardchoille	I agree, I was imagining someone else woudl bring up security as a counterargument to what I was saying
2010-02-23T15:36:00.000Z	ardchoille	uyjhgjhkg	I realize you're frustrated, but I feel your attitude might benefit from change if you want people to help you instead of put you on ignore for ranting. Just my 2 cents.
2010-02-23T15:37:00.000Z	uyjhgjhkg	ardchoille	I was just correcting his misunderstanding of what I said re security, I appreciate your concern though.
2010-02-23T15:49:00.000Z	ardchoille	uyjhgjhkg	Can you just do another sql dump?
2010-02-23T15:49:00.000Z	uyjhgjhkg	ardchoille	I dumped the file. I moved the file
2010-02-23T15:50:00.000Z	uyjhgjhkg	ardchoille	the most important thing in computing is reproducibility, simplicity, removing entropuy
2010-02-23T15:51:00.000Z	uyjhgjhkg	ardchoille	so I setup the user and copy everything, and then do some rm's without thinking, pissed that THINGS AREN'T JUST STANDARD
2010-02-23T15:52:00.000Z	ardchoille	uyjhgjhkg	careful, my friend. Take a deep breath :)
