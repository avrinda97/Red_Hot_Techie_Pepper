2012-07-07T21:41:00.000Z	flan_suse		Ubuntu 12.04 and themes have thrown me for a loop.
2012-07-07T21:42:00.000Z	flan_suse		When you apply a "theme" is it GTK3 or GTK2? And what's the difference betweens setting the Theme under "Appearance" and setting it under MyUnity? Nothing seems consistent.
2012-07-07T21:43:00.000Z	flan_suse		And how come some themes look ugly when setting them (flat, windows-2000) but others look fine?
2012-07-07T21:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	flan_suse	if you are using Precise (12.04 Ubuntu) it will be GTK3
2012-07-07T21:43:00.000Z	flan_suse	ActionParsnip	So GTK2 themes will not work at all then?
2012-07-07T21:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	flan_suse	unfortunately not
2012-07-07T21:44:00.000Z	flan_suse	ActionParsnip	And what about the window manager? Anything special for those? Does it have to be compiz themes?
2012-07-07T21:44:00.000Z	flan_suse	ActionParsnip	I'm getting mixed up between setting a theme under Appearance or setting a theme under MyUnity.

2012-07-07T21:51:00.000Z	flan_suse	ActionParsnip	gnome-tweak-tool? Another tool?
2012-07-07T21:51:00.000Z	flan_suse	ActionParsnip	So use gnome-tweak-tool under Ubuntu, but not ubuntu-tweak or MyUnity?
2012-07-07T21:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	flan_suse	try it
2012-09-21T04:07:00.000Z	flan_suse	ActionParsnip	That doesn't show this: libdrm-intel1:i386
2012-09-21T04:07:00.000Z	flan_suse	ActionParsnip	It's i386 for amd64 installs.
2012-09-21T04:07:00.000Z	flan_suse	ActionParsnip	I'm kind of confused of how the multiarch support is supposed to work...
2012-09-21T04:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	flan_suse	the 64bit OS is multi-arch
2012-09-21T04:08:00.000Z	flan_suse	ActionParsnip	Right, but is the package somehow hidden unless multiarch is enabled or something?
2012-09-21T04:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	flan_suse	its used by default
2012-09-21T04:08:00.000Z	flan_suse	ActionParsnip	Okay, so then I guess the package doesn't exist?
2012-09-21T04:09:00.000Z	flan_suse	ActionParsnip	My log shows it was updated, and then later removed (after using the xorg-edgers PPA.)
2012-09-21T04:09:00.000Z	flan_suse	ActionParsnip	However, how was it "updated" when it didn't even exist?
