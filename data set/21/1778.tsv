2010-06-28T07:48:00.000Z	jb12		someone help
2010-06-28T07:49:00.000Z	edbian	jb12	hi
2010-06-28T07:49:00.000Z	edbian	jb12	By can't see it, I assume you mean it doesn't show up on the desktop or in places -> "computer" is that right?
2010-06-28T07:50:00.000Z	edbian	jb12	Is it plugged in right now?
2010-06-28T07:51:00.000Z	edbian	jb12	Nice! :)  Anywho, does it show up in the output of sudo fdisk -l   ??  You'll have to read the sizes.
2010-06-28T07:52:00.000Z	edbian	jb12	Plug it in and remove it and check dmesg
2010-06-28T07:53:00.000Z	edbian	jb12	does dmesg record it being plugged in and removed??
2010-06-28T07:55:00.000Z	edbian	jb12	whoa, don't you copy and paste that here.
2010-06-28T07:55:00.000Z	edbian	jb12	use pastebin
2010-06-28T07:55:00.000Z	edbian	jb12	but it should be at the very bottom because plugging in the usb drive is the most recent thing.
2010-06-28T07:56:00.000Z	edbian	jb12	Here is a line from my dmesg after plugging in a usb stick:  usb 5-5: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 4
2010-06-28T07:57:00.000Z	edbian	jb12	Then about 20 other lines
2010-06-28T07:57:00.000Z	edbian	jb12	http://paste.ubuntu.com/456179/
2010-06-28T07:59:00.000Z	jb12	edbian	here it is.........http://paste.ubuntu.com/456180/
2010-06-28T08:01:00.000Z	edbian	jb12	I see nothing about your usb drive.  Does the key light up?  ARe you sure the key is good and the system's usb ports work?
2010-06-28T08:03:00.000Z	edbian	jb12	I suspect the usb ports aren't working
2010-06-28T08:03:00.000Z	edbian	jb12	The usb ports probably aren't being recognized correctly in Ubuntu.  I'm not sure how to help with that! :(  I think the key and USB hardware works fine.  Just isn't being used right by Ubuntu
2010-06-28T08:05:00.000Z	edbian	jb12	I don't know :(
