2006-09-18T10:24:00.000Z	Steil		 i just ate a bacon and cheese sandwich (bacon cooked with cheese then the grease drizzled on the bread to "toast" it.)
2006-09-18T10:24:00.000Z	Steil		 and it was still cold when I bit into it
2006-09-18T10:24:00.000Z	Steil		yes
2006-09-18T10:24:00.000Z	Steil		bacon from a pig
2006-09-18T10:24:00.000Z	Steil		undercooked underrated
2006-09-18T10:25:00.000Z	Steil		very tasty, i support bacon anyday
2006-09-18T10:25:00.000Z	Steil		I don't love bacon
2006-09-18T10:25:00.000Z	Steil		it gives me worms
2006-09-18T10:25:00.000Z	Steil		but the worms let me stay the same weight
2006-09-18T10:26:00.000Z	Steil		i eat for 3 and i stay the same size
2006-09-18T10:26:00.000Z	Flannel	Steil	that's nice.  #ubuntu-offtopic
2006-09-18T10:27:00.000Z	Flannel	Steil	no, this is a support channel, general chatter belongs in #ubuntu-offtopic
2007-02-06T13:43:00.000Z	Flannel	Steil	you already have it, don't you?
2007-02-06T13:43:00.000Z	Steil	Flannel	when i try to mount a ntfs partition it says that ntfs is an unknown fs
2007-02-06T13:45:00.000Z	Flannel	Steil	what command are you using?
2007-02-06T13:46:00.000Z	Flannel	Steil	try giving it a -t ntfs
2007-02-06T13:47:00.000Z	Flannel	Steil	and actually, ntfs uses dmask and fmask
2007-02-06T13:47:00.000Z	Flannel	Steil	er... no it doesn't.  b
2007-02-06T13:50:00.000Z	Flannel	Steil	What version of ubuntu are you using?
2007-02-06T13:52:00.000Z	Flannel	Steil	I guess yeah, for some reason your kernel doesn't have ntfs support built in, you'll have to look towards the other stuff, find an open source one (not a wrapper of XP libraries)
2007-03-31T09:24:00.000Z	Flannel	Steil	ctothej, doubt edgy will get OOo 2.2.  Backports only happen for really big stuff.
