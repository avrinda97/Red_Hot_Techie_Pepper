2006-01-24T14:17:00.000Z	redwolf	specialbuddy	try this link: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
2006-01-24T14:18:00.000Z	redwolf	specialbuddy	contains directions for what you want to do
2006-01-24T14:24:00.000Z	specialbuddy	redwolf	how did you get mplayer to work
2006-01-24T14:24:00.000Z	redwolf	specialbuddy	I just used mplayer-mozilla, the mplayer package for my proc (k8), and loaded my codecs onto it
2006-01-24T14:30:00.000Z	specialbuddy	redwolf	can you look at this http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/7352
2006-01-24T14:31:00.000Z	redwolf	specialbuddy	what processor do you have?
2006-01-24T14:32:00.000Z	redwolf	specialbuddy	try installing the mplayer-686 package, and give me the output of that if it fails
2006-01-24T14:34:00.000Z	redwolf	specialbuddy	do the same for the mplayer package now
2006-01-24T14:36:00.000Z	redwolf	specialbuddy	give me the output of it if it fails to install
2006-01-24T14:40:00.000Z	specialbuddy	redwolf	if I can't find mplayer in synaptic then does that mean that I need to do something with the repositories
2006-01-24T14:41:00.000Z	redwolf	specialbuddy	yes, it probably does
2006-01-24T14:41:00.000Z	redwolf	specialbuddy	do you have the universe and multiverse repositories (if you don't know, probably not)?
2006-01-24T14:43:00.000Z	redwolf	specialbuddy	let's make sure, go here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AddingRepositoriesHowto
2006-01-24T14:44:00.000Z	redwolf	specialbuddy	it works for 5.10 too
2006-01-24T15:15:00.000Z	specialbuddy	redwolf	I think I solved the problem
2006-01-24T15:15:00.000Z	redwolf	specialbuddy	good
