2004-09-19T15:22:00.000Z	seb128		hey carlos 
2004-09-19T15:23:00.000Z	carlos	seb128	I have a funny bug with epiphany
2004-09-19T15:23:00.000Z	carlos	seb128	I cannot visit https://www.networksolutions.com
2004-09-19T15:24:00.000Z	carlos	seb128	I see it's not a know bug
2004-09-19T15:28:00.000Z	carlos	seb128	#1112
2004-09-19T15:37:00.000Z	seb128	carlos	still here ?
2004-09-19T15:37:00.000Z	carlos	seb128	yes
2004-09-19T15:38:00.000Z	carlos	seb128	thanks, it works
2004-09-19T15:39:00.000Z	seb128	carlos	basically
2004-09-26T15:25:00.000Z	carlos	seb128	hey !
2004-09-26T16:11:00.000Z	carlos	seb128	I'm not able to regenerate the .pot file from the ubuntu's gnome-applets package. did you have any problem about it when preparing the package for ubuntu?
2004-09-26T16:14:00.000Z	seb128	carlos	no, what's the problem ?
2004-09-26T16:15:00.000Z	seb128	carlos	which ones ?
2004-09-26T16:17:00.000Z	seb128	carlos	what do you do to get this ?
2004-09-26T16:17:00.000Z	carlos	seb128	it's possible that the binary build does not raise the error, but cannot understand how could that pass make dist-check to release the tar.gz...
2004-09-26T16:20:00.000Z	carlos	seb128	don't worry about it, I only asked because It's funny to think that a package was relased that way
2004-10-23T09:25:00.000Z	carlos	seb128	is it normal that the Computer folder has "Network" icon inside? I thought it was removed so only local volumes will be there
2004-10-23T09:27:00.000Z	seb128	carlos	jamesh did the changes, no sure if that's a bug or if the icon has not been moved ...
2004-10-23T09:34:00.000Z	seb128	carlos	please assign it directly to jamesh 
2004-12-04T17:58:00.000Z	seb128	carlos	I think you're getting too in the details, uncommenting should be enough
2004-12-04T17:59:00.000Z	carlos	seb128	yeah, I thought he had it already activated
