2006-11-10T07:21:00.000Z	ailean	jrib	i just can't get this dvd to play

2006-11-10T07:24:00.000Z	jrib	ailean	and you installed dvdcss from seveas' repo ok?

2006-11-10T07:27:00.000Z	ailean	jrib	for seveas' repo, should i leave it as dapper, or change it to edgy?
2006-11-10T07:28:00.000Z	jrib	ailean	use the appropriate one for what you are using.  edgy: edgy, dapper: dapper
2006-11-10T07:28:00.000Z	ailean	jrib	ta
2006-11-10T07:33:00.000Z	ailean	jrib	it was a problem with the actual DVD, i think. when it stopped after the piracy warning, but if i selected the menu before that could happen, it would continue.  not ideal, but i think it's just this DVD
2006-11-10T07:33:00.000Z	jrib	ailean	oh I see, good catch
2006-12-15T13:08:00.000Z	jrib	ailean	edit /boot/grub/menu.lst with your favorite text editor
2006-12-15T13:09:00.000Z	ailean	jrib	just put the one i want at the top or what?
2006-12-15T13:09:00.000Z	jrib	ailean	no, read the comments about "default"
2007-07-19T12:25:00.000Z	jrib	ailean	yep, and you're identified
