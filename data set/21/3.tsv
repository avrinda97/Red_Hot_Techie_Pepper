2004-11-27T07:28:00.000Z	mjg59	lifeless	What does /sys/class/net/eth1/driver point to? (assuming eth1 is the ipw)
2004-11-27T07:31:00.000Z	mjg59	lifeless	If you could take a look at the prepare.sh and resume.sh scripts and try to figure out why the ipw2200 driver isn't getting unloaded, that would rock
2004-11-27T07:33:00.000Z	mjg59	lifeless	Because most network drivers don't
2004-11-27T07:33:00.000Z	lifeless	mjg59	ah.
2004-11-27T07:35:00.000Z	mjg59	lifeless	Doh
2004-11-27T07:45:00.000Z	mjg59	lifeless	Any joy with that?
2004-11-27T07:47:00.000Z	lifeless	mjg59	swsuspend just worked for me. Yay!. I owe you beer.
2004-11-27T07:47:00.000Z	lifeless	mjg59	I don't see a prepare.sh though...
2004-11-27T07:49:00.000Z	mjg59	lifeless	Did you install acpi-support?
2004-11-27T07:49:00.000Z	lifeless	mjg59	yah
2004-11-27T07:49:00.000Z	mjg59	lifeless	Does dpkg -L acpi-support show /etc/acpi/prepare.sh ?
2004-11-27T07:49:00.000Z	mjg59	lifeless	That's thom's acpi-support
2004-11-27T07:50:00.000Z	lifeless	mjg59	no it doesn't.
2004-11-27T07:56:00.000Z	mjg59	lifeless	Rocking
2004-11-27T07:57:00.000Z	lifeless	mjg59	have yo considered using ip link rather than ifconfig ?
2004-11-27T07:58:00.000Z	mjg59	lifeless	I know nothing about the ip command
2004-11-27T07:58:00.000Z	lifeless	mjg59	ah. /very/ useful command
2004-11-27T07:58:00.000Z	mjg59	lifeless	Is there any reason that it'd make a difference?
2004-11-27T07:58:00.000Z	mjg59	lifeless	It shouldn't make any difference, really
2004-12-31T09:13:00.000Z	lifeless	mjg59	esd doesn't behave usefullyt... ever
