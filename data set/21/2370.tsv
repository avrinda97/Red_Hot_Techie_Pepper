2009-10-31T12:21:00.000Z	Psinetic		didn't work..
2009-10-31T12:21:00.000Z	Psinetic		>_>
2009-10-31T12:23:00.000Z	Psinetic		yeah....this is just totally screwed up...omg
2009-10-31T12:24:00.000Z	Psinetic		lol i bet if it does this again i'm gonna buy a mac....for serious, this is starting to piss me off
2009-10-31T12:24:00.000Z	Psinetic		yeah...that would explain it
2009-10-31T12:26:00.000Z	Psinetic		if windows fixes my hard drive then maybe i won't hate it as much....
2009-10-31T12:26:00.000Z	MaxJizzy	Psinetic	try format with windows, install windows, download the iso fresh from a torrent, then download unetbootin and browse the iso. set it to mount from hardrive and not usb. then you are ready for a fast new install of ubuntu. do parition on your disk with windows installation. like 4 gb's of windows partition and rest to linux, leave the rest unformated.
2009-10-31T12:26:00.000Z	Psinetic		has anyone else experienced this problem? i just want to make sure IndyGunFreak that this wasn't actually caused by the installer for karmic.
2009-10-31T12:27:00.000Z	MaxJizzy	Psinetic	and then leave the iso for a safety, if anything fails you just load the windows bootloader and run live cd
2009-10-31T12:27:00.000Z	Psinetic	MaxJizzy	you miss the point...i cna't boot any of my partitions with the live cd. i won't install windows, there's nothing wrong with the live cd at all. somehow the hard drive got jacked in the middle of my upgrade
2009-10-31T12:28:00.000Z	MaxJizzy	Psinetic	i have had that prob
2009-10-31T12:28:00.000Z	Psinetic	MaxJizzy	and this is how you had to fix it? was by wiping the partition with windows cd?
2009-10-31T12:28:00.000Z	MaxJizzy		windows format do the trick, it's always nice to have a windows beside the ubuntu, it's like jing and jang. good and bad. god and satan.. so on.
2009-10-31T12:29:00.000Z	MaxJizzy	Psinetic	yepp
2009-10-31T12:29:00.000Z	Psinetic	MaxJizzy	what caused the problem to begin with, you know?
2009-10-31T12:29:00.000Z	MaxJizzy	Psinetic	ubuntu installation
2009-10-31T12:29:00.000Z	MaxJizzy		from a bad source.
2009-10-31T12:29:00.000Z	MaxJizzy		corrupt cd, and hardware.
2009-10-31T12:29:00.000Z	MaxJizzy		cd installations is bad, mkey?
2009-10-31T12:30:00.000Z	Psinetic	MaxJizzy	then do you think we might want to let the upper level guys know they need to find a way to fix this if it ever happens again?
