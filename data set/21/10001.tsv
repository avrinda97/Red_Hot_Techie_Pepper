2005-05-29T10:30:00.000Z	jroes_		anyone ever get the following in their dmesg?  "Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 00323533..."
2005-05-29T10:31:00.000Z	nevyn	jroes_	bad ram or kernel bug
2005-05-29T10:31:00.000Z	nevyn	jroes_	or bad swap
2005-05-29T10:31:00.000Z	jroes_		hmm
2005-05-29T10:32:00.000Z	jroes_		the RAM has been working for a while but recently windows had trouble installing on this machine, so I decided to install Linux
2005-05-29T10:32:00.000Z	nevyn	jroes_	working doesn't mean it's not bad.
2005-05-29T10:32:00.000Z	jroes_		:P
2005-05-29T10:32:00.000Z	nevyn	jroes_	memory problems are nasty
2005-05-29T10:33:00.000Z	jroes_		probably not a kernel bug...  any idea how I could deal with it?
2005-05-29T10:33:00.000Z	jroes_		without buying ram, that is :P
2005-05-29T10:33:00.000Z	nevyn	jroes_	run memtest on the system for a few hrs
2005-05-29T10:33:00.000Z	nevyn	jroes_	test the disk with badblocks or similar
2005-05-29T10:33:00.000Z	nevyn	jroes_	how much ram is there?
2005-05-29T10:34:00.000Z	jroes_		well, if I run memtest and it reports an error - and I don't want to buy ram... is there a way I can just work-around the ram :P
2005-05-29T10:34:00.000Z	jroes_	nevyn	128
2005-05-29T10:34:00.000Z	nevyn	jroes_	linux supports memory holes
2005-05-29T10:34:00.000Z	jroes_		sweet :)
2005-05-29T10:34:00.000Z	jroes_		that's what I was hoping for...
2005-05-29T10:35:00.000Z	nevyn	jroes_	there was a patch floating around where you could specify a region of the physical map that was dodgy to avoid.
2005-05-29T10:35:00.000Z	jroes_		that's awesome
2005-05-29T10:35:00.000Z	nevyn	jroes_	I don't know if it was merged into the mainline kernel
