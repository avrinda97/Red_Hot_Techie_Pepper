2012-11-19T15:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	frederick	is it a piece of hardware?
2012-11-19T15:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	frederick	how does it connect to the PC?
2012-11-19T15:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	frederick	If you run:  lsusb    you will see an 8 character hex ID, use it to find guides
2012-11-19T15:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	frederick	one line will identify the device
2012-11-19T15:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	frederick	if it is unclear, unplug the device and rerun lsusb, the line that vanishes is the device
2012-11-19T15:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	frederick	use the 8 character hex ID to find guides online
2012-11-19T15:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	frederick	yes, that would be how you can find stuff online using a piece of text......
2012-11-19T15:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	frederick	YES!
2012-11-19T15:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	frederick	well,I found a fix...
2012-11-19T15:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	frederick	what is the output of:   lsb_release -sc
2012-11-19T15:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	frederick	http://pastebin.com/3r2Qaz55
2012-11-19T15:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	frederick	not sure if it works, worth a punt. I used the ID you generated, just like I said and *poof* a bug report with possible fix.....imagine......
2012-11-19T15:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	frederick	even with crappy google there are 2 bugs with 2 different solutions...
2012-11-20T09:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	frederick	I suggest you add to the bugs on launchpad and state what you know and have
2012-11-20T09:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	frederick	add to the bugs
2012-11-20T09:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	frederick	post on the page in the box at the bottom
2012-11-20T09:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	frederick	search for the 8 character hex ID, it's how I found them
