2007-12-09T01:37:00.000Z	hanta		anyone knows how to make ubuntu faster???
2007-12-09T01:38:00.000Z	PirateHead	hanta	More RAM helps, more swap might help, shutting down some services might help.
2007-12-09T01:38:00.000Z	hanta		ahaaha!!
2007-12-09T01:39:00.000Z	hanta		Is it enough with 1 gb of swap ?
2007-12-09T01:39:00.000Z	PirateHead		 /ban silent reason=troll
2007-12-09T01:39:00.000Z	hanta		okey
2007-12-09T01:39:00.000Z	PirateHead	hanta	1gb of swap is good
2007-12-09T01:40:00.000Z	hanta	dan	: I have 1.25 gb RAM
2007-12-09T01:41:00.000Z	hanta		Desktop computing only, It just seems slow with this gnome desktop
2007-12-09T01:41:00.000Z	PirateHead	hanta	Ubuntu should be plenty fast for you, then. I'm running it on 512mb of ram and it's fine.
2007-12-09T01:41:00.000Z	hanta		htop is marking a 33mb use of swap right now
2007-12-09T01:42:00.000Z	PirateHead		#ubuntu+1 has been active for weeks
2007-12-09T01:42:00.000Z	hanta		1gb
2007-12-09T01:42:00.000Z	PirateHead		1.25 gb of RAM with 1 gb of swap should be plenty and then some.
2007-12-09T01:43:00.000Z	hanta		okay
2007-12-09T01:43:00.000Z	hanta		then
2007-12-09T01:43:00.000Z	PirateHead	hanta	Perhaps there's a process sucking up a ton of resources?
2007-12-09T01:43:00.000Z	hanta		It may be
2007-12-09T01:43:00.000Z	hanta		may be is gnome itself?
2007-12-09T01:43:00.000Z	PirateHead	hanta	Do you know how to use ps to check resource usage?
2007-12-09T01:44:00.000Z	PirateHead	hanta	Gnome is a little heavy compared to some other desktop environments, but you have enough ram to handle it easily.
