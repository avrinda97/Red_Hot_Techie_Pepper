2012-02-25T09:53:00.000Z	L3top		grep "\'\$"
2012-02-25T09:55:00.000Z	escott	L3top	`Korvin it is the diff between echo "\$" and echo '\$' that is the problem
2012-03-18T08:19:00.000Z	L3top	escott	beat me to it
2012-03-18T09:02:00.000Z	escott	L3top	gzip is block compression it can easily keep up with data streaming off a disk
2012-05-13T08:04:00.000Z	escott	L3top	sure you can. why wouldn't you be able to
2012-05-13T08:06:00.000Z	escott	L3top	you can run tcp/ip over carrier pigeons and you can mkfs or fsck anything that presents itself as a block device (including stone tablets if you have a driver for it)
2012-06-17T18:47:00.000Z	escott	L3top	ironhide. i kept trying to think of the new name and could only come up with "tireiron" and just knew that wasn't correct
2012-06-17T18:48:00.000Z	L3top	escott	Ironhide was actually the first one... created by MrMEEE, bumblebee is a fork from Ironhide.
2012-07-03T03:34:00.000Z	escott	L3top	we got it to bring up the kernel, but there was no root
2012-07-03T03:37:00.000Z	L3top	escott	I see... but bringing up unity gui on a km400 is going to be... fun without these issues. The best driver she will have available is the openchrome, and I would not expect more than 2d unity. It is an integrated micro/pico itx board without a lot of umph. Just be mindful if only terminal hits.
2012-07-03T03:37:00.000Z	escott	L3top	she is running xubuntu
2012-07-03T03:37:00.000Z	escott	L3top	not a problem
2012-07-03T03:38:00.000Z	escott	L3top	if you've got any ideas i would appreciate them. grub.cfg lists root=/dev/sda1 which is correct, but the kernel panic'ed when it couldn't find root on (0,0)
2012-07-03T03:38:00.000Z	escott	L3top	presumably the full message was couldn't find root on hd(0,0) or something
2012-07-03T03:39:00.000Z	escott	L3top	as MissVera typed it out her panic was: "not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block (0,0)"
2012-07-03T03:45:00.000Z	escott	L3top	BHSPitMonkey, Jordan_U_bak for everyone trying to help MissVera. installed on /dev/sda1. kernel panic couldn't find root. grub.cfg lists root=/dev/sda1, /etc/default/grub says use UUID. fstab UUID is correct. initrd is updated. chipset is S3 junk... but that would seem to be unrelated to the kernel panic
2012-07-03T03:46:00.000Z	L3top	escott	often (esp with these) KP occurs with unrecognized nic.
2012-07-03T03:47:00.000Z	L3top	escott	though this does not seem related to the message puked
2012-07-03T03:59:00.000Z	escott	L3top	thanks!
2012-07-10T03:48:00.000Z	L3top	escott	in system/motherboard/extended features, what do you have checked?
2012-07-23T05:57:00.000Z	escott	L3top	no problem. i think we all realized it at the same time
