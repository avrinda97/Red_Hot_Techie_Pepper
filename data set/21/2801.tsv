2009-07-28T15:43:00.000Z	jrib	om26er	apt installs dependencies automatically when you install a package.  You don't have to do anything
2009-07-31T20:54:00.000Z	om26er	jrib	go to hell
2009-07-31T21:29:00.000Z	jrib	om26er	do you just want to disable the effects?  System -> Preferences -> Appearance -> Effects

2009-09-12T16:45:00.000Z	jrib	om26er	with the patch command.  It's man page is very readable
2009-09-12T16:47:00.000Z	jrib	om26er	well to read patch's man page, you run « man patch »
2009-09-12T16:47:00.000Z	jrib	om26er	http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/1237 is also a good introduction
2009-09-12T16:56:00.000Z	om26er	jrib	if a program is installed then how to i use patch file to work. it asks for which file to patch
2009-09-12T16:56:00.000Z	jrib	om26er	you didn't read the article...
2009-09-12T16:56:00.000Z	jrib	om26er	anyway, you usually patch source code.  Which means first you need to know how to rebuild packages from source.  Do you know how to do that?
2009-11-08T16:02:00.000Z	jrib	om26er	space is limited on the cd.  But there are a few in the repositories: pitivi and kino for example
2011-04-19T20:06:00.000Z	jrib	om26er	creation time is not stored so that's not possible.  You can use "stat" to look up access time
