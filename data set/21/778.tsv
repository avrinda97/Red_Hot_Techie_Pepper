2011-06-16T13:13:00.000Z	testadura		does anyone know how to re-poweron an usb device after safe removal without detaching and reattaching it?
2011-06-16T13:13:00.000Z	ghsh	testadura	mount
2011-06-16T13:13:00.000Z	testadura	ghsh	does nothing at all
2011-06-16T13:13:00.000Z	testadura	ghsh	the device is still power off
2011-06-16T13:14:00.000Z	ghsh	testadura	mount /dev/sdbX /USB(name)
2011-06-16T13:14:00.000Z	testadura	ghsh	if there isn't a refresh command or something like it, maybe some string to write in some file in /proc
2011-06-16T13:14:00.000Z	testadura	ghsh	the device doesn't exist anymore
2011-06-16T13:15:00.000Z	testadura	ghsh	it is an internal card reader and i cannot detach-attach it
2011-06-16T13:15:00.000Z	ghsh	testadura	ah write a hard inode or add it to fstab
2011-06-16T13:15:00.000Z	testadura	ghsh	the device is just powered off
2011-06-16T13:16:00.000Z	ghsh	testadura	ya I know all those ways should work -- even mount
2011-06-16T13:16:00.000Z	testadura	ghsh	the ways you wrote can work _ONLY_ if the device is still powered on
2011-06-16T13:17:00.000Z	ghsh	testadura	no
2011-06-16T13:17:00.000Z	ghsh	testadura	not if there is a hard node
2011-06-16T13:20:00.000Z	ghsh	testadura	ok I may have it
2011-06-16T13:20:00.000Z	testadura	ghsh	?
2011-06-16T13:20:00.000Z	ghsh	testadura	why or how does the usb power off
2011-06-16T13:24:00.000Z	testadura	ghsh	???
2011-06-16T13:26:00.000Z	ghsh	testadura	well how does it stop working
2011-06-16T13:26:00.000Z	testadura	ghsh	because i safely removed the SD card
2011-06-16T13:29:00.000Z	ghsh	testadura	i did that with a wmodem back in 1998
