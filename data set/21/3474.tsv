2008-12-19T14:12:00.000Z	Neaai	gizmo_	psybnc should compile in any system that has a *nix compatible compiler to what I know. Usually you ./configure  then  make then make install, in the majority of the cases.
2008-12-19T14:26:00.000Z	Neaai	gizmo_	if you got a .tar.gz file as you said for the psybnc, the way to 'open' it would be to go the directory where you downloaded it, and then:   tar -zxvf psybncfile.tar.gz
2008-12-19T14:26:00.000Z	gizmo_	Neaai	already i open..but how to make psybnc?
2008-12-19T14:26:00.000Z	Neaai	gizmo_	is there any README file there ?
2008-12-19T14:27:00.000Z	gizmo_	Neaai	nope..
2008-12-19T14:27:00.000Z	Neaai	gizmo_	or any INSTALL file? Those files have all the instructions you'd  need.
2008-12-19T14:29:00.000Z	Neaai	gizmo_	that there is no /server directory
2008-12-19T14:29:00.000Z	gizmo_	Neaai	how to get server?have to d/l or w.get
2008-12-19T14:32:00.000Z	Neaai	gizmo_	well I just checked the psybnc official site and got the .tar.gz file. There *is* a README file in there. You have to follow its instructions to install.
2008-12-19T14:33:00.000Z	Neaai	gizmo_	now, with any text editor.
2008-12-19T14:37:00.000Z	Neaai	gizmo_	have you compiled the thing successfully ?
2008-12-19T14:37:00.000Z	gizmo_	Neaai	 nope
2008-12-19T14:37:00.000Z	Neaai	gizmo_	that's what you have to do for sure otherwise you have nothing.
2008-12-19T14:39:00.000Z	Neaai	gizmo_	follow the instructions given at section (a) of the README file and do as it says.
2008-12-19T14:40:00.000Z	Neaai	gizmo_	to what I saw, you have to "make menuconfig" and after you set the configuration right you have to simply  "make"
