2008-06-12T18:04:00.000Z	kniolet		Hi, ccmake seems to have dissapeared? i tried reinstalling cmake, but still when i run ccmake it tells me that i need to sudo-apt get install cmake... anyone know whats up there?
2008-06-12T18:05:00.000Z	kniolet		and /usr/bin/ccmake is gone, but /usr/bin/cmake is still there
2008-06-12T18:05:00.000Z	anirudh0	kniolet	cmake . does the same job...dont forget the .
2008-06-12T18:05:00.000Z	kniolet	anirudh0	no ccmake is a gui interface to it
2008-06-12T18:06:00.000Z	anirudh0	kniolet	cmake . gives a ncurses based interface..identical for all practical purpoeses
2008-06-12T18:07:00.000Z	kniolet	anirudh0	no thats cmake -i . i think you are talking about
2008-06-12T18:07:00.000Z	anirudh0	kniolet	is there a CMakeLists.txt in your dir?
2008-06-12T18:08:00.000Z	kniolet	anirudh0	yes lol
2008-06-12T18:09:00.000Z	kniolet	anirudh0	it doesnt change the problem that ccmake is missing from what i guess was the most recent camke package update
2008-06-12T18:09:00.000Z	anirudh0	kniolet	yes...i forgot the -i switch..you can also pass parameters in the cmd line..eg cmake . CMAKE_LIB_DIR=/home/lib
2008-06-12T18:09:00.000Z	kniolet	anirudh0	ye s i know but that a pain in the butt when you have 30-40 options
2008-06-12T18:09:00.000Z	anirudh0	kniolet	kde4?
2008-06-12T18:10:00.000Z	kniolet	anirudh0	no its commercial software, 4.5million LOCs ;-)
2008-06-12T18:11:00.000Z	anirudh0	kniolet	not a very good option..but you can manually edit the CMakecache.txt...equivalent in every way
2008-06-12T18:11:00.000Z	kniolet	anirudh0	thanks for trying to help, but thats not a good option either because an svn update means manual merging then which sucks
2008-06-12T18:12:00.000Z	kniolet	anirudh0	i guess i just need to email the cmake package maintainer
2008-06-12T18:12:00.000Z	anirudh0	kniolet	you could always use a static binary from the kitware site
2008-06-12T18:12:00.000Z	kniolet	anirudh0	i was just hoping someone ran into it before and said like "oh, they moved it to blahblahblah or something"
2008-06-12T18:12:00.000Z	kniolet	anirudh0	im more trying to point out a problem in ubuntu than get a solution
2008-06-12T18:13:00.000Z	anirudh0	kniolet	ok
2008-06-12T18:13:00.000Z	kniolet	anirudh0	thanks though :-)
