2010-05-28T06:10:00.000Z	ikonia		oops
2010-05-28T06:12:00.000Z	glight	ikonia	how do I check the way lvm wrote across the drives?
2010-05-28T06:10:00.000Z	ikonia	glight	you can't just swap disks out on lvm like that
2010-05-28T06:10:00.000Z	ikonia	glight	did you setup any raid levels either at the volume group level or the pv level
2010-05-28T06:10:00.000Z	ikonia	glight	hello
2010-05-28T06:11:00.000Z	glight	ikonia	hi
2010-05-28T06:11:00.000Z	glight	ikonia	I haven't set up anything to do with RAID
2010-05-28T06:11:00.000Z	ikonia	glight	then your data is gone
2010-05-28T06:12:00.000Z	ikonia	glight	using lvm like that will just either use right->left writing, in which case data gone, or stripe across all pv's, in which case, data gone
2010-05-28T06:12:00.000Z	glight	ikonia	I don't mind losing the data on the drive that died, are you telling me I have lost everything?
2010-05-28T06:12:00.000Z	ikonia	glight	yes
2010-05-28T06:12:00.000Z	ikonia	glight	if you've got spread across all pv's - it's gone
2010-05-28T06:13:00.000Z	ikonia	glight	do an lvdisplay -v on the volume see if you can get the info's
2010-05-28T06:13:00.000Z	ikonia	glight	very likley data is gone though as the file system has been damaged (by the death of one disk )
2010-05-28T06:14:00.000Z	ikonia	glight	lvm at default level is just concatination
2010-05-28T06:14:00.000Z	glight	ikonia	lvdisplay prints the details on my lv
2010-05-28T06:14:00.000Z	glight	ikonia	do you want any of the specifics?
2010-05-28T06:15:00.000Z	ikonia	glight	nah, doesn't say, just checked
2010-05-28T06:19:00.000Z	glight	ikonia	so is there a way I can attempt to mount the remaining data?
2010-05-28T06:20:00.000Z	ikonia	glight	I don't see how with a 3rd of your file system missing
2010-05-28T06:24:00.000Z	glight	ikonia	ok thanks for the assistance
