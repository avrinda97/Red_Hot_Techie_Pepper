2006-12-14T06:59:00.000Z	kaur		my laptop's idle cpu temp is about 50 C and I don't know what is causing it
2006-12-14T06:59:00.000Z	kaur		please help
2006-12-14T06:59:00.000Z	kaur		sometimes it is 43 C and doesn't go higher
2006-12-14T07:00:00.000Z	javaJake	kaur	my temp is lucky to get to that point. :P
2006-12-14T07:01:00.000Z	kaur	javaJake	do u have any idea how to cool it?
2006-12-14T07:02:00.000Z	javaJake	kaur	mmm, no, the laptop should automatically decide when it is too hot and turn on a fan or something
2006-12-14T07:02:00.000Z	kaur	javaJake	it turns on the fan when it reaches 50, but it should not reach that high at all when idle
2006-12-14T07:03:00.000Z	javaJake	kaur	ok, don't know what to say...
2006-12-14T07:03:00.000Z	kaur	javaJake	I've looked around in the forum and it seems that this is a common bug
2006-12-14T07:04:00.000Z	javaJake	kaur	oh, ok...
2006-12-14T07:04:00.000Z	javaJake	kaur	perhaps the problem is the same as mine - processor running at full speed even when idle. :P
2006-12-14T07:04:00.000Z	kaur	javaJake	i had that problem and i solved it
2006-12-14T07:05:00.000Z	javaJake	kaur	oh, how?
2006-12-14T07:05:00.000Z	kaur	javaJake	u aren't using the generic kernel by any chance?
2006-12-14T07:05:00.000Z	javaJake	kaur	yea
2006-12-14T07:06:00.000Z	kaur	javaJake	there seems to be a bug in it
2006-12-14T07:06:00.000Z	kaur	javaJake	use 686 kernel
2006-12-14T07:06:00.000Z	javaJake	kaur	mm, no, works in edgy, just not in feisty.
2006-12-14T07:06:00.000Z	kaur	javaJake	mine doesn't work in edgy
2006-12-14T07:07:00.000Z	kaur	javaJake	i think it's the Dual Core stuff that confuses it
2006-12-14T07:07:00.000Z	javaJake	kaur	uh, yea, I've got a P3, so no dual stuff happening here.
