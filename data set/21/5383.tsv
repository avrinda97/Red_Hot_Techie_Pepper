2007-11-02T03:48:00.000Z	Perrako		Can anyone help? I can't boot into any of my OSes without using a cd
2007-11-02T03:49:00.000Z	Ebiggs	Perrako	Does your Grub menu appear?
2007-11-02T03:49:00.000Z	Perrako	Ebiggs	-- nope. If I use something like Super Grub Disk, it does, or if I use the last option on the ubuntu cd
2007-11-02T03:50:00.000Z	Ebiggs	Perrako	Have you used the bootloader recovery on the Super Grub Disk?
2007-11-02T03:50:00.000Z	Perrako	Ebiggs	-- I might not have correctly. which option is it?
2007-11-02T03:51:00.000Z	Ebiggs	Perrako	umm...I don't know by memory.  Let me find a website.
2007-11-02T03:51:00.000Z	Perrako	Ebiggs	thanks :)
2007-11-02T03:54:00.000Z	Ebiggs	Perrako	first choose GNU/Linux
2007-11-02T03:54:00.000Z	Perrako		k
2007-11-02T03:55:00.000Z	Ebiggs	Perrako	After that you should see something about fix Grub?
2007-11-02T03:55:00.000Z	Perrako	Ebiggs	alright -- I'll try that. Which partition should I set as bootable? I'm splitting a 250 disk between ubuntu and windows
2007-11-02T03:56:00.000Z	Perrako		And grub said it installed to hd0, but I have another disk that's hda
2007-11-02T03:56:00.000Z	Ebiggs	Perrako	Most people just install it to the MBR.  I've put it on my root partition before.
2007-11-02T03:57:00.000Z	Perrako	Ebiggs	so which partition should I set to bootable? my linux one?
2007-11-02T03:57:00.000Z	Ebiggs	Perrako	You mean where to install the bootloader?
2007-11-02T03:57:00.000Z	Perrako	Ebiggs	no -- setting the boot flag
2007-11-02T03:58:00.000Z	Ebiggs	Perrako	Sorry, I don't know about that...I only have one HDD so all I had to do was tell it to install to the MBR.
2007-11-02T03:58:00.000Z	Perrako		Hehe
2007-11-02T03:58:00.000Z	Perrako		okay
2007-11-02T03:58:00.000Z	Perrako		I'll just try the sgd and we'll see how it goes
2007-11-02T03:59:00.000Z	Ebiggs	Perrako	Good luck. ;_
