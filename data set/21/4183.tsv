2008-09-18T01:31:00.000Z	Reformer81		I've installed Ubuntu 8.04 on a system that does not have internet access.  I would like to know how I would go about downloading packages and updates to put on a CD and then bring them to the other computer to install them.  I'm particularly interested in installing the Nvidia drivers and multimedia support.  I have already looked at AptOnCD, but it doesn't include any of the restricted packages I'm most interested in.
2008-09-18T01:33:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Reformer81	Yes we did .. more than once
2008-09-18T01:33:00.000Z	Reformer81	Jack_Sparrow	It's been changed.
2008-09-18T01:33:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Reformer81	Did you even look at what aptoncd is?
2008-09-18T01:34:00.000Z	Reformer81	Jack_Sparrow	Yes.  I've looked at it before and I have it open right now as well.  It does not have the packages I'm looking for.
2008-09-18T01:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Reformer81	You build it with the packages you download.
2008-09-18T01:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Reformer81	burn /var/cache/apt/archives to a cd or dvd
2008-09-18T01:34:00.000Z	Reformer81	Jack_Sparrow	Then why is nvidia-glx-new and all the multimedia codecs not there?  Those are the only packages I really urgently wanted to get.
2008-09-18T01:35:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Reformer81	You are not understanding what aptoncd is..
2008-09-18T01:36:00.000Z	Reformer81	Jack_Sparrow	It will allow me to create a cd of all the packages I've downloaded using Apt of Synaptic, right?
2008-09-18T01:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Reformer81	yes
2008-09-18T01:36:00.000Z	Reformer81	Jack_Sparrow	Well, I didn't use apt or synaptic to install them (they were automatically installed either with "Hardware Drivers" or when I tried to play a restricted format.  Whether those programs use apt or not, those packages are NOT in /var/cache/apt/archives
2008-09-18T01:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Reformer81	basically everything in /var/cache/apt/archives along with a reference file for the mirror/repo
2008-09-18T01:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Reformer81	It does packages that you downloaded...
2008-09-18T01:38:00.000Z	Reformer81	Jack_Sparrow	I understand that.  But the packages are NOT there... lol.  I don't know how to be any more clear, I'm sorry.
2008-09-18T01:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Reformer81	I have no interest..
2008-09-18T01:40:00.000Z	Reformer81	Jack_Sparrow	Then don't consider me an idiot.  I asked how to do it without APTonCD and you refused to answer.
2008-09-18T01:40:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Reformer81	Tone down the attitude
2008-12-11T01:16:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Reformer81	it is supposed to work.. yes
2008-12-11T01:16:00.000Z	Reformer81	Jack_Sparrow	THanks
2009-02-25T07:17:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Reformer81	Edit fstab to mount your drive every boot
