2006-11-10T15:11:00.000Z	Intangir		how do i set up X Forwarding to use a port UNDER 6000
2006-11-10T15:11:00.000Z	Intangir		like i wasnt to use 5999 or something, instead of 6000
2006-11-10T15:12:00.000Z	Intangir		cause our firewall seems to have some sort of hardcoded block of 6000+
2006-11-10T15:12:00.000Z	Intangir		lol
2006-11-10T15:14:00.000Z	bruenig	Intangir	you may clog the tubes
2006-12-26T08:02:00.000Z	bruenig	Intangir	try this, sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/install-css.sh
2006-12-26T08:03:00.000Z	bruenig	Intangir	also, sudo apt-get install totem-xine if you haven't already. Then try opening in totem
2006-12-26T08:03:00.000Z	bruenig	Intangir	don't do the sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/install-css.sh
2006-12-26T08:03:00.000Z	bruenig	Intangir	I don't know what I was thinking, it won't hurt, just unnecessary
2007-03-20T12:11:00.000Z	bruenig	Intangir	look into du
2007-03-20T12:14:00.000Z	bruenig	Intangir	you can do du -hs to get a size for your particular directory
2007-03-20T12:14:00.000Z	bruenig	Intangir	du -hs directory/
2007-03-20T12:15:00.000Z	bruenig	Intangir	what are you trying to do exactly, I am sure there is a way. I am not getting what you are wanting. I thought du -hs was it
2007-03-20T12:16:00.000Z	bruenig	Intangir	right but what are you trying to do as far as figuring out directory size
2007-03-20T12:16:00.000Z	Intangir	bruenig	but im working remotely so text would be good, or maybe really light graphical look, but a way to easily see where most of my space is being wasted
2007-03-20T12:16:00.000Z	bruenig	Intangir	my thought is that you were in a directory, and you wanted to find out what the size of all the subdirectories in that directory was like, so du -hs *
2007-03-20T12:17:00.000Z	Intangir	bruenig	oh thats helpful actual
2007-03-20T12:20:00.000Z	Intangir	bruenig	do you know of a way to sort?
2007-03-20T12:22:00.000Z	bruenig	Intangir	not really, I mean using grep you could sort things into GB MB and KB
2007-03-20T12:26:00.000Z	bruenig	Intangir	something like this could help: KB=$(du -hs * | grep K) && MB=$(du -hs * | grep M) && GB=$(du -hs * | grep G) ; echo $KB ; echo $MB ; echo $GB
2007-03-20T12:27:00.000Z	bruenig	Intangir	or you can switch the echo $KB and echo $GB if you want it to descend
