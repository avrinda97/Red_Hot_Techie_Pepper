2007-01-11T15:53:00.000Z	un_operateur	CotRo|eR	IIRC .. each VNC session uses it's own port in addition to 5900 .. e.g. VNC session #1 uses 5901.. #2 uses 5902, etc
2007-01-11T15:53:00.000Z	CotRo|eR	un_operateur	so is that the problem?
2007-01-11T15:54:00.000Z	un_operateur	CotRo|eR	well, i'm only 80% sure that is the case .. please verify .. and if thats the case, then all the VNC ports need to be forwarded ..
2007-01-11T15:55:00.000Z	CotRo|eR	un_operateur	if i forward ports 5900, 5901, 5902 5903 5904 and 5905 is enough?
2007-01-11T15:55:00.000Z	un_operateur	CotRo|eR	actually why don't you verify .. get one of the LAN clients to connect upto the VNC server and then monitor network connections on the server via netstat
2007-01-11T15:56:00.000Z	un_operateur	CotRo|eR	if you are supporting upto 5 VNC sessions, that should be enough, yes
2007-01-11T15:56:00.000Z	CotRo|eR	un_operateur	can i monitor it by firestarter?
2007-01-11T15:56:00.000Z	un_operateur	CotRo|eR	errm, I'm not very conversant with firestarter but i assume it can tell you
2007-01-11T15:57:00.000Z	CotRo|eR	un_operateur	i checked it it used ports: 80 + 5900 :|
2007-01-11T15:59:00.000Z	un_operateur	CotRo|eR	check netstat in addition to firestarter ..  make the connection and then at a terminal -- netstat -panto
2007-01-11T15:59:00.000Z	CotRo|eR	un_operateur	will do that tnx cheers
2007-01-11T16:01:00.000Z	CotRo|eR	un_operateur	i have tons of connections, how do i know which ones are from localhost?
2007-01-11T16:02:00.000Z	un_operateur	CotRo|eR	the ones from localhost originate from 127.0.0.1 .. so you can grep for that -- netstat -panto | grep 127.0.0.1
2007-01-11T16:05:00.000Z	CotRo|eR	un_operateur	is there some way to open all ports temporarily to see if that is the problem ?
2007-01-11T16:05:00.000Z	un_operateur	CotRo|eR	you mean drop all the iptables rules?
2007-01-11T16:05:00.000Z	CotRo|eR	un_operateur	think so
2007-01-11T16:18:00.000Z	CotRo|eR	un_operateur	tried everything shit same error :|
2007-01-11T16:19:00.000Z	un_operateur	CotRo|eR	did you try tearing down all the iptables .. did that help?
2007-01-11T16:19:00.000Z	CotRo|eR	un_operateur	yes still with problem :|
2007-01-11T16:20:00.000Z	un_operateur	CotRo|eR	well, then the iptables arent contributing to the problem; it lies elsewhere
2007-01-11T16:22:00.000Z	CotRo|eR	un_operateur	what could be the problem? :S
