2010-09-13T13:59:00.000Z	pie_time		i cant seem to connect via sftp to the other pc on my LAN. i have an exception in firestarter. could anyone help me?
2010-09-13T13:59:00.000Z	Cmdr_W_T_Riker	pie_time	is ssh listening on the other pc?
2010-09-13T14:00:00.000Z	pie_time	Cmdr_W_T_Riker	im not sure what does "listening" entail?
2010-09-13T14:00:00.000Z	Cmdr_W_T_Riker	pie_time	sftp depends on a listening ssh server. the ssh server is not installed by default, so you might have to install that first
2010-09-13T14:01:00.000Z	pie_time	Cmdr_W_T_Riker	that is installed
2010-09-13T14:01:00.000Z	Cmdr_W_T_Riker	pie_time	ok, so you can 'ssh' into your machine?
2010-09-13T14:01:00.000Z	pie_time	Cmdr_W_T_Riker	no.
2010-09-13T14:03:00.000Z	Cmdr_W_T_Riker	pie_time	hmm okay, are you sure sshd (the server) is running? The output of 'netstat -tnl | grep 22' should answer this
2010-09-13T14:06:00.000Z	pie_time	Cmdr_W_T_Riker	back. i saw a couple of lines beginning with tcp, and a couple beginning with tcp6 but no ssh
2010-09-13T14:06:00.000Z	pie_time	Cmdr_W_T_Riker	actually just one line beginning with tcp6
2010-09-13T14:07:00.000Z	Cmdr_W_T_Riker	pie_time	sounds like ssh is not running then. Are you sure it's installed? 'sudo apt-get install ssh' to install the server (the client is there already by default)
2010-09-13T14:08:00.000Z	pie_time	Cmdr_W_T_Riker	it's already installed
2010-09-13T14:09:00.000Z	Cmdr_W_T_Riker	pie_time	try 'sudo service ssh start'
2010-09-13T14:10:00.000Z	pie_time	Cmdr_W_T_Riker	Job is already running: ssh
2010-09-13T14:12:00.000Z	Cmdr_W_T_Riker	pie_time	and you can not ssh into this machine from another on your network? Do you have a firewall configured that is blocking incoming port 22?
2010-09-13T14:13:00.000Z	pie_time	Cmdr_W_T_Riker	it appears SSH events keep coming up in my firestarter log even though I have exceptions for that machine
2010-09-13T14:15:00.000Z	Cmdr_W_T_Riker	pie_time	still, it seems that requests are blocked anyhow by firestarter. i suggest looking into config of firestarter again
2010-09-13T14:16:00.000Z	pie_time	Cmdr_W_T_Riker	i've looked several times and i have all the exceptions I could possibly need. what could be wrong with it?
2010-09-13T14:18:00.000Z	pie_time	Cmdr_W_T_Riker	nevermind. i have it now
2010-09-13T14:19:00.000Z	pie_time	Cmdr_W_T_Riker	thanks for your help :)
2010-09-13T14:19:00.000Z	Cmdr_W_T_Riker	pie_time	you're welcome
