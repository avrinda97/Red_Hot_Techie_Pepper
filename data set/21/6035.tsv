2007-06-16T09:43:00.000Z	natbet		is there a way to force remove a package? vmware-player won't complete the install and I can't remove it
2007-06-16T09:44:00.000Z	stefg	natbet	which vmware-player? the ubuntu-package or a download from the vmware-site?
2007-06-16T09:47:00.000Z	stefg	natbet	sudo /etc/init.d/vmnet stop && sudo rmmod vmnet , then try agagin
2007-06-16T09:49:00.000Z	natbet	stefg	didn't work, vmnet isn't in /etc/init.d/
2007-06-16T09:51:00.000Z	stefg	natbet	i see... then sudo rm -rf /etc/vmware (delete the vmware config-dir), then reboot and try to sudo apt-get remove --purge vmware-player
2007-06-16T09:52:00.000Z	natbet	stefg	ok, I got it, I did a ps aux | grep vmnet and killed those processes, it's removed now, thanks
2007-06-16T10:01:00.000Z	stefg	natbet	how are the drives connected? is there some controller (like a Promise one) which manages the raid, or is is it done purely by software (this means using mdadm or lvm) ?
2007-06-16T09:58:00.000Z	stefg	natbet	soft-, fake- or hardware-raid?
2007-06-16T09:59:00.000Z	natbet	stefg	not sure, I set it up at boot up, right after post, I think that's hardware isn't it?
2007-06-16T10:02:00.000Z	natbet	stefg	they are both SATA hard drives directly attached to the motherboard, In windows, I have to install software in order to access the raid
2007-06-16T10:04:00.000Z	stefg	natbet	so i think it's a fake-raid then. some controller, but the CPU is doing the work.  So you want to access your win partition (which is fake raid 0) ?
2007-06-16T10:05:00.000Z	natbet	stefg	well, I have an IDE with the OSs on it, then the SATAs raided together for backup/storage and yeah, I'd like to figure out how to access them
2007-06-16T10:08:00.000Z	stefg	natbet	in general it's better to use lvm to deal with raid arrays in linux. So the kernel sees the drives individually and you set them up as soft-raid. Only when you want to access a previously created array you have to find and setup a linux-driver for the controller, that ake the kernel see the individual drives as one big drive
2007-06-29T08:46:00.000Z	stefg	natbet	because network manager is a pile of bugs /rant off
2007-06-29T08:47:00.000Z	natbet	stefg	I agree, any other options for wpa networks?
2007-06-29T08:48:00.000Z	stefg	natbet	uninstall network manager and try to get wpa supplicant to work
2007-06-29T08:49:00.000Z	natbet	stefg	manually editing wpasupplicant.conf and adding it to /etc/networking/interfaces right?
2007-06-29T08:49:00.000Z	stefg	natbet	along that lines.... (no specialist for that, still trusting to copper)
2007-06-29T08:50:00.000Z	natbet	stefg	yeah, that's how I used to do it in dapper, I had hoped that network manager would be better in feisty. copper?
2007-06-29T08:50:00.000Z	stefg	natbet	good'ole copper cable :-)
2007-06-29T08:51:00.000Z	natbet	stefg	I agree, I usually use that but sometimes you're in a coffee shop that only has wireless *sigh*
