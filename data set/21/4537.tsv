2008-04-25T00:06:00.000Z	tawt		can anyone help me?  is there a good app that can download videos from YouTube?
2008-04-25T00:07:00.000Z	maco	tawt	the unplug extension for firefox
2009-01-19T01:41:00.000Z	maco	tawt	are you sure the kernel upgrade finished?
2009-01-19T01:41:00.000Z	tawt	maco	i thought it did
2009-01-19T01:41:00.000Z	maco	tawt	"sudo dpkg --configure -a" to make sure the package finished configuring
2009-01-19T01:43:00.000Z	maco	tawt	its also possible that you went from like -3.20 to -3.21 which doesnt make a new entry in the menu. only going to -4 would do that
2009-01-19T01:45:00.000Z	tawt	maco	it says my system is up to date
2009-01-19T01:47:00.000Z	maco	tawt	then it was probably an upgrade that *doesn't* require a new menu.lst entry
2009-01-19T01:47:00.000Z	maco	tawt	your kernel's naming format is something like 2.6.27-3.20 (for example). if the 27 or the 3 changes, you get a new entry. if the 20 changes, you don't.
2009-01-19T01:47:00.000Z	tawt	maco	but when i do "uname -r" i get "2.6.24-22-generic"
2009-01-19T01:48:00.000Z	maco	tawt	right, because only the 24 and 22 really matter for the ABI
2009-01-19T01:49:00.000Z	maco	tawt	the package should, i think say the . bit, but it doesnt change the ABI, so proprietary drivers (like fglrx for ati cards) dont need to be reinstalled
2009-01-19T01:49:00.000Z	maco	tawt	the . bit is just which time it was compiled. it means it was just a small change.
2009-01-19T01:50:00.000Z	tawt	maco	so is there any way to boot into a kernel designed for 8.10 instead of still using the 8.04 kernels i have?
2009-01-19T01:50:00.000Z	maco	tawt	you can install one
2009-01-19T01:51:00.000Z	tawt	maco	how would i go about that
2009-01-19T01:52:00.000Z	maco	tawt	packages.ubuntu.com, find the 2.6.27-x-generic where x is the highest number. install that one. but if youve got binary ati or fglrx, you'll have a problem. because then you need the newer graphical drivers, and then you need a newer X and then you need to upgrade all your graphical apps...
2009-01-19T01:52:00.000Z	maco	tawt	at least, its possible to get into that mess if you need binary drivers
2009-01-19T01:54:00.000Z	tawt	maco	can you link me the site for the kernel download?
2009-01-19T01:55:00.000Z	maco	tawt	http://packages.ubuntu.com/intrepid/linux-image-2.6.27-9-generic
2009-01-19T01:56:00.000Z	tawt	maco	thank you
