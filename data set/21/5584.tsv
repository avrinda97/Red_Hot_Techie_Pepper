2007-09-22T10:20:00.000Z	jrib	}}Y2J{{	sounds like you do not have a specific issue you want to troubleshoot?  You can try creating a new user and seeing if the problems go away.   Or you can backup your data and reinstall
2007-09-22T10:21:00.000Z	}}Y2J{{	jrib	,, it's not like that, but I cant enjoy my desktop now ,,
2007-09-22T10:25:00.000Z	}}Y2J{{	jrib	.. no ideas ?!
2007-09-22T10:25:00.000Z	jrib	}}Y2J{{	I still don't know what exactly the problem is
2007-09-22T10:26:00.000Z	}}Y2J{{	jrib	The problem that my desktop-effects is gone and I can't bring it back with re-install packages again ..
2007-09-22T10:27:00.000Z	jrib	}}Y2J{{	can you login without desktop effects at the moment?
2007-09-22T10:28:00.000Z	}}Y2J{{	jrib	, Yes .. I just want to know in general is there's a way to bring things to fresh install to make me able to upgrade
2007-09-22T10:29:00.000Z	jrib	}}Y2J{{	no, not really, other than a new install and restoring from backups.  Not using automatix in the future will probably help too.
2007-09-22T10:30:00.000Z	}}Y2J{{	jrib	,, If I reinstall now and using only synbtic ,, I will be able to upgrade ? or that dist-upgrade ?
2007-09-22T10:30:00.000Z	}}Y2J{{	jrib	forgive me for the NewB questions ,, I am a beginner
2007-09-22T10:31:00.000Z	jrib	}}Y2J{{	yes, but if you reinstall, you should install the latest version so you won't need to dist-upgrade
2007-09-22T10:31:00.000Z	}}Y2J{{	jrib	you mean Alpha 5 ?
2007-09-22T10:31:00.000Z	jrib	}}Y2J{{	no, feisty
2007-09-22T10:32:00.000Z	jrib	}}Y2J{{	yes, then you shouldn't dist-upgrade to gutsy until it is released about a month from now
2007-09-22T10:33:00.000Z	}}Y2J{{	jrib	Thanks , I think i am going to re-insta;; :(
