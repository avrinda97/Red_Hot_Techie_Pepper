2005-12-15T09:50:00.000Z	_jason	Emberly	you could also just let it load on the web page and then save page as I believe
2005-12-15T09:50:00.000Z	Emberly	_jason	this is for websites that don't have a direct link in their page. like pages that call files from a php script or something
2005-12-15T09:51:00.000Z	Emberly	_jason	so i can't save-as
2005-12-15T09:51:00.000Z	_jason	Emberly	oh I just clicked on that planetquake link, I thought that's the one you wanted
2005-12-15T09:51:00.000Z	Emberly	_jason	yeah it's what i want, but i can't save-as because it won't load all the way and lags out. so i just need it to download like a regular file
2005-12-15T09:52:00.000Z	Emberly	_jason	is that how most people do it though? just wait for it to load on the page and save-as?  what about for really large files?
2005-12-15T09:52:00.000Z	_jason	Emberly	well no, you can change the setting.  But if you are having trouble, you can load the page... see the url.. and then wget it
2005-12-15T09:54:00.000Z	Emberly	_jason	load the page, see the url hm ok...
2005-12-15T09:55:00.000Z	_jason	Emberly	for example, I see: ftp://quake3files.com/linuxq3apoint-1.32.x86.run
2005-12-15T09:57:00.000Z	Emberly	_jason	i cant use wget because it says logging in as anonymous and there is no anonymous
2005-12-15T09:59:00.000Z	_jason	Emberly	I think that would be best (actually changing the setting) but I believe there is also an extension that will let you enter url's to download
2005-12-15T10:00:00.000Z	Emberly	_jason	but I don't have the authentication information that the php page is apparently sending to the server
2005-12-15T10:00:00.000Z	Emberly	_jason	so any kind of file download manager would have to borrow that
2005-12-15T10:18:00.000Z	_jason	Emberly	oh, flashgot is an extension for firefox by the way
2005-12-15T10:17:00.000Z	_jason	Emberly	well I just tried downloading with flashgot using d4x as the download manager and it works.  I thought you could change the setting, but I am getting a different opinion from #firefox
2005-12-15T10:18:00.000Z	Emberly	_jason	ok, so d4x as a download manager... ok. i've never had to use download managers before.
2005-12-15T10:20:00.000Z	_jason	Emberly	do you want me to send you this?  or can I just delete
2005-12-15T10:20:00.000Z	Emberly	_jason	i would like the file, but I also want to learn how to do this so i stop having this problem. how do you want to transfer it?
2005-12-15T10:21:00.000Z	Emberly	_jason	pm me?
2005-12-15T10:21:00.000Z	_jason	Emberly	sure.  I haven't tried dcc on xchat yet, let's see how it goes
2005-12-15T10:22:00.000Z	Emberly	_jason	xie xie ni
