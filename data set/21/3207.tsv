2009-05-31T00:11:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	dassouki	sudoers if for about adding permission for a user to run a particular file as root - what are you trying to do?  allow anyone to shutdown?
2009-05-31T00:11:00.000Z	dassouki	ZykoticK9	no allow a user to sudo apt-get install :D i don't want to do it from root
2009-05-31T00:12:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	dassouki	sorry man i'm not going to help you with that.  you're trying to turn linux into windows and i won't help.
2009-05-31T00:13:00.000Z	dassouki	ZykoticK9	do u install all your software logged in as "root" ??
2009-05-31T00:13:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	dassouki	of course not - i use sudo
2009-05-31T00:13:00.000Z	dassouki	ZykoticK9	ya i'm tyring to add a user so they can use sudoers
2009-05-31T00:13:00.000Z	dassouki	ZykoticK9	ya i'm tyring to add a user so they can use sudo
2009-05-31T00:14:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	dassouki	wrong file then - just add the user to the admin group and your golden :)
2009-05-31T00:14:00.000Z	dassouki	ZykoticK9	useradd username admin .. admin group doesn't exist
2009-05-31T00:15:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	dassouki	what do you see if you "cat /etc/group | grep admin" - to we see it then?
2009-05-31T00:16:00.000Z	dassouki	ZykoticK9	no output
2009-05-31T00:17:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	dassouki	what are you running?  you should CERTAINLY have that account on any *buntu system?  what has happened?
2009-05-31T00:17:00.000Z	dassouki	ZykoticK9	it's my host ... ubuntu 9.04
2009-05-31T00:19:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	dassouki	how many when you run "cat /etc/passwd | wc -l"
2009-05-31T00:20:00.000Z	dassouki	ZykoticK9	23
2009-05-31T00:21:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	dassouki	so there are some users on the system.  when you said it was your 'host' you mean this is some sort of remote machine hosted on a provider somewhere?
2009-05-31T00:21:00.000Z	dassouki	ZykoticK9	yes linode
2009-05-31T00:22:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	dassouki	sorry man - perhaps there security has removed admin access?  this isn't a situation i feel comfortable with anymore - best of luck (but every default Ubuntu should have an admin group - so something is VERY strange there)
2009-05-31T00:22:00.000Z	dassouki	ZykoticK9	thanks :D
2010-08-14T04:27:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	dassouki	with linux there is always "a way" it's just a matter of find/figuring it out ;)  Good luck man, i don't know how BTW
