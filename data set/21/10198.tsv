2005-08-23T12:01:00.000Z	IceDC571		is anyone here using the new breezy?
2005-08-23T12:01:00.000Z	vitriol	IceDC571	i'm attempting to upgrade to breezy right now
2005-08-23T12:01:00.000Z	vitriol	IceDC571	why?
2005-08-23T12:02:00.000Z	vitriol	IceDC571	i tried the daily breezy build cd (from yesterday) and it installed and wouldn't boot up afterwards
2005-08-23T12:02:00.000Z	IceDC571	vitriol	well... i just did a clean install with colony 3 release and the install script hangs after i reboot
2005-08-23T12:02:00.000Z	vitriol	IceDC571	yeah that was exactly my problem
2005-08-23T12:03:00.000Z	IceDC571	vitriol	yeah.. so im stuck, i dont know what to do. have any suggestions?
2005-08-23T12:03:00.000Z	vitriol	IceDC571	you can try what i'm doing right now
2005-08-23T12:05:00.000Z	vitriol	IceDC571	dunno
2005-08-23T12:06:00.000Z	vitriol	IceDC571	i just want my hardware to work....
2005-08-23T12:11:00.000Z	IceDC571	vitriol	well.. are you upgrading to breezy soon?
2005-08-23T12:11:00.000Z	vitriol	IceDC571	yes...right now
2005-08-23T12:12:00.000Z	IceDC571	vitriol	let me know how it works out
2005-08-23T12:12:00.000Z	vitriol	IceDC571	last time i tried this it broke either python or perl
2005-08-23T12:12:00.000Z	vitriol	IceDC571	and consequently broke apt
2005-08-23T12:24:00.000Z	IceDC571	vitriol	omg.. i got the post-install script to work again
2005-08-23T12:24:00.000Z	vitriol	IceDC571	breezy just worked for me :D
2005-08-23T12:24:00.000Z	IceDC571	vitriol	did you just upgrade it from hoary?
2005-08-23T12:24:00.000Z	vitriol	IceDC571	yes
2005-08-23T12:25:00.000Z	IceDC571	vitriol	well.. i think i might of found a workaround for fixing the post-install script so lets see if breezy will work after this
2005-08-23T12:34:00.000Z	IceDC571	vitriol	so did you just change your sources to display breezy instead of hoary?
