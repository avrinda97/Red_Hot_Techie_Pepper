2011-11-13T00:24:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg		I need help with my display drivers and monitor,can anyone help me?
2011-11-13T00:25:00.000Z	DexterF	nightwalkerkg	state what problem you have and what you tried so far.
2011-11-13T00:27:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg	DexterF	Before the reinstallation i tried almost evrything i could find on the interent.The problem is my monitor is unknown and i have only 2 possible resolutions avalable.
2011-11-13T00:27:00.000Z	DexterF	nightwalkerkg	well, ok, but: *what* is the problem? :)
2011-11-13T00:29:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg	DexterF	Oh,also the ATI droped the support for my card and the drivers won't work.
2011-11-13T00:29:00.000Z	DexterF	nightwalkerkg	what card, what monitor, by what cable is the monitor connected?
2011-11-13T00:31:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg	DexterF	Diamond ATI Radeon 9550,LG FLATRON ez T710B and VGA.
2011-11-13T00:33:00.000Z	DexterF	nightwalkerkg	VGA cable or 5xBNC cable?
2011-11-13T00:34:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg	DexterF	VGA cable.
2011-11-13T00:35:00.000Z	DexterF	nightwalkerkg	strange. check the programs in the read-edid package. check if X reads the monitor capabilites at all. if that looks good paste Xorg.0.log somewhere. pastebin.com for example
2011-11-13T00:36:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg	DexterF	can you explane how to do it,i am a new ubuntu user.
2011-11-13T00:38:00.000Z	DexterF	nightwalkerkg	install the package read-edid. run the command:   get-edid | parse-edid   on a console, paste output to pastebin.com. then on a console do:  sudo cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2011-11-13T00:39:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg	DexterF	sure thing,back in a sec.
2011-11-13T00:40:00.000Z	DexterF	nightwalkerkg	uh... which version of ubuntu, and did you install the AMD binary driver (ubuntu would have asked for sth like "do you want to install drivers for this and that card that are not part of the standard installatio" or sth like that) or are you on free drivers?
2011-11-13T00:41:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg	DexterF	Ubuntu 11.10 32bit and i am on the free drivers. Tried installing them before the reinstalation but the aticonfig and few other stuff didn't work with them.
2011-11-13T00:42:00.000Z	DexterF	nightwalkerkg	ah, but you did run it - maybe there's some old cruft left? is there a file /etc/X11/xorg.conf?
2011-11-13T00:43:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg	DexterF	i have a new installation of ubuntu.Reinstalled it before 15 min to start clean.Nothing is installed.
2011-11-13T00:43:00.000Z	DexterF	nightwalkerkg	ok, then I'd really check #radeon
2011-11-13T00:44:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg	DexterF	can't send any message to that chanel.
2011-11-13T00:45:00.000Z	DexterF	nightwalkerkg	need to register your nick on freenode. try /msg nickserv identify... i think
