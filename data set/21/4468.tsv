2008-04-22T11:45:00.000Z	bazhang		wow stop now
2008-04-22T11:46:00.000Z	Aces	bazhang	it seems its just in the Ubuntu repository
2008-04-22T11:41:00.000Z	bazhang	Aces	how did you try to install it? from source, a deb or other
2008-04-22T11:42:00.000Z	Aces	bazhang	sudo apt-get
2008-04-22T11:42:00.000Z	bazhang	Aces	which repo is it in?
2008-04-22T11:43:00.000Z	Aces	bazhang	umm ill i did was sudo apt-get install wifi-radar
2008-04-22T11:47:00.000Z	bazhang	Aces	any reason to be using wifi-radar as opposed to cli or network-manager?
2008-04-22T11:48:00.000Z	Aces	bazhang	because I seem to get really low signal strength with network manager and I read on some forum disabling it and using wifi radar might help
2008-04-22T11:48:00.000Z	Aces	bazhang	 either way something must be wrong with it since i cant even remove it
2008-04-22T11:49:00.000Z	bazhang	Aces	admittedly nm is not that wonderful, have you considered just connecting via cli? that is the surest option
2008-04-22T11:50:00.000Z	Aces	bazhang	You gave me a link to set it up earlier but I havent got around to going through it yet
2008-04-22T11:50:00.000Z	bazhang	Aces	what is the wifi hotspot; open, wep, wpa etc
2008-04-22T11:50:00.000Z	Aces	bazhang	well I opened it up because whenever I tried to connect while it was WEP it froze Ubuntu
2008-04-22T11:53:00.000Z	bazhang	Aces	you have the three entries in ifconfig right? eth0 lo and wlan0 (or somesuch)
2008-04-22T11:57:00.000Z	Aces	bazhang	 yes i do
2008-04-22T11:58:00.000Z	Aces	bazhang	 renewal in 42392 seconds.
2008-04-22T11:59:00.000Z	bazhang	Aces	can you surf the net now?
2008-04-22T11:59:00.000Z	Aces	bazhang	yes
2008-04-22T11:59:00.000Z	bazhang	Aces	great; next step is to get wpa2 on there
2008-04-22T12:00:00.000Z	Aces	bazhang	k
2008-04-22T12:22:00.000Z	bazhang	Aces	did you sudo?
