2010-01-29T05:11:00.000Z	novato_br		!last kernel
2010-01-29T05:12:00.000Z	novato_br		I've download ubuntu from website and It got ubuntu with kernel 2.6.x.31-17
2010-01-29T05:12:00.000Z	novato_br		that is old
2010-01-29T05:12:00.000Z	novato_br		no I want to download
2010-01-29T05:12:00.000Z	shudder	novato_br	oh ok
2010-01-29T05:12:00.000Z	shudder	novato_br	I don't think you can since it only releases once every six months
2010-01-29T05:16:00.000Z	shudder	novato_br	yeah. I'm not on ubuntu, but shouldnt the kernel update for you automagically
2010-01-29T05:16:00.000Z	shudder	novato_br	yes
2010-01-29T05:17:00.000Z	shudder	novato_br	it should just be an auto update
2010-01-29T05:17:00.000Z	shudder	novato_br	In what regard?
2010-01-29T05:22:00.000Z	shudder	novato_br	not sure about the command line, but you might want to check out this site: http://www.pendrivelinux.com/
2010-01-29T05:23:00.000Z	novato_br	shudder	could I tell a little story about my troubles here?
2010-01-29T05:24:00.000Z	novato_br	shudder	I'm working hardly with ubuntu.
2010-01-29T05:32:00.000Z	shudder	novato_br	is there an obscure driver for it somewhere?
2010-01-29T05:34:00.000Z	shudder	novato_br	but you need the latest kernel to install it?
2010-01-29T05:35:00.000Z	shudder	novato_br	what do you mean, it gives you errors or compiles fine and doesn't work
2010-01-29T05:36:00.000Z	novato_br	shudder	on compilation there are two errors
2010-01-29T05:36:00.000Z	shudder	novato_br	do you have all the compile packages installed?
2010-01-29T05:37:00.000Z	shudder	novato_br	like build-essential etc.?
2010-01-29T05:39:00.000Z	novato_br	shudder	I think so
