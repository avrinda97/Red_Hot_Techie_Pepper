2012-02-09T14:47:00.000Z	steven123	theadmin	thanks. But that generates the list of installed packages only. As does dpkg --get-selections. I need the d-i script which keeps track of all the choices made during install
2012-02-09T14:47:00.000Z	theadmin	steven123	"See also !automate" :P
2012-02-09T14:47:00.000Z	theadmin		!automate | steven123
2012-02-09T14:49:00.000Z	steven123	theadmin	thanks. I followed that guide to the tee. However, there's no mention of how to generate the preseed file based on a prior installation. There's an example, but I've been tweaking it and I've run multiple installs. I just can't get the options right :)
2012-02-09T14:50:00.000Z	theadmin	steven123	Hm, I'm not sure about that, sorry
2012-02-09T14:50:00.000Z	steven123		this is what it says in the guide: $ debconf-get-selections --installer > file. Which would be great, if only that binary existed :D
2012-02-09T14:51:00.000Z	theadmin		!find debconf-get-selections
2012-02-09T14:51:00.000Z	theadmin	steven123	^
2012-02-09T14:51:00.000Z	steven123		yep, but that doesn't have an installation candidate and has been replaced by debconf-i18n :D
2012-02-09T14:51:00.000Z	theadmin		Wut? Weird.
2012-02-09T14:52:00.000Z	steven123		Yep :)
2012-02-09T14:53:00.000Z	theadmin	steven123	You sure your repos are sane? I see debconf-utils in the repos
2012-02-09T14:54:00.000Z	steven123	theadmin	this is a clean install of Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (from the alternate cd)
2012-02-09T14:54:00.000Z	theadmin		!find debconf-get-selections lucid
2012-02-09T14:54:00.000Z	theadmin		Hm.
2012-02-09T14:54:00.000Z	theadmin	steven123	Shouldn't be any different
2012-02-09T14:55:00.000Z	steven123	theadmin	weird. I'll try to update my sources list
2012-02-09T15:14:00.000Z	steven123	theadmin	I found it. The alternate cd sets main restricted in the apt sources file. Removing restricted allows me to install debconf-utils. Thanks for the help
2012-02-09T15:15:00.000Z	theadmin	steven123	Weird... but okay
