2010-01-24T12:55:00.000Z	ardchoille		james: Dr_Willis has good advice, ubuntu-tweak is probably better than my tutorial
2010-01-24T12:56:00.000Z	Myrtti	ardchoille	and ubuntu-tweak is a 3rd party tool...
2010-01-24T12:56:00.000Z	ardchoille	Myrtti	Ah, yes
2010-02-04T15:47:00.000Z	Myrtti	ardchoille	it's not installed by default...
2010-02-04T15:48:00.000Z	ardchoille	Myrtti	not even on the server?
2010-02-04T15:48:00.000Z	Myrtti	ardchoille	nothing is installed by default that would open up ports on the machine. LAMP isn't the only reason to use -server, so why install it by default
2010-02-04T15:49:00.000Z	ardchoille	Myrtti	Ah, my bad. Just assumed from the name "server"
2010-02-05T13:58:00.000Z	ardchoille	Myrtti	You remember right :)
2010-02-05T14:06:00.000Z	Myrtti	ardchoille	youcef: or install youtube-dl
2010-02-05T14:07:00.000Z	ardchoille	Myrtti	Good idea, but can't justify installing an app when nautilus can do it without the app
2010-02-05T14:07:00.000Z	Myrtti	ardchoille	if you don't have flash installed, but want to use vlc, you can download the stuff and so on
2010-02-05T14:07:00.000Z	Myrtti	ardchoille	also, using it to download to a remote machine
2010-02-05T14:07:00.000Z	ardchoille	Myrtti	Ah, good point
2010-02-23T13:10:00.000Z	ardchoille	Myrtti	Thank you for that info :)
2010-03-09T14:34:00.000Z	ardchoille	Myrtti	Thank you
2010-03-09T14:55:00.000Z	ardchoille	Myrtti	he's back ( locolen )
2010-03-10T14:46:00.000Z	ardchoille	Myrtti	 looks like multiple nicks from the same ip
2012-10-20T23:18:00.000Z	Myrtti	ardchoille	even,sorry arashi256
2012-10-20T23:19:00.000Z	ardchoille	Myrtti	What's up? I didn't quite understand what happened there
2012-10-20T23:19:00.000Z	Myrtti	ardchoille	I made a query and it tired ubottu a bit.
2012-10-20T23:19:00.000Z	ardchoille	Myrtti	ah, ok. Was hoping everything was ok with the poor overworked bot :)
