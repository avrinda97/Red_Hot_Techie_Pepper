2011-09-05T16:52:00.000Z	supNow		someone help me please I've been in computer hell for a week!
2011-09-05T16:52:00.000Z	supNow		I installed ubuntu and it took over my entire 2tb drive
2011-09-05T16:52:00.000Z	supNow		windows will not format it back to ntfs
2011-09-05T16:53:00.000Z	usr13	supNow	Why not?
2011-09-05T16:53:00.000Z	usr13	supNow	And how did ubuntu take over the "entire 2td drive"?
2011-09-05T16:54:00.000Z	usr13	supNow	You can just use fdisk to remove the partitions
2011-09-05T16:55:00.000Z	usr13	supNow	Which one is it? /dev/sdb  ?
2011-09-05T16:55:00.000Z	usr13	supNow	What kind of drive is it?
2011-09-05T16:55:00.000Z	usr13	supNow	What kind of drive is it? And which one is it?  /dev/sd?
2011-09-05T16:56:00.000Z	usr13	supNow	We don't support windows installations here.
2011-09-05T16:57:00.000Z	usr13	supNow	Like I said, if you just delete all partitons, windows will format the drive as it sees fit.  sudo fdisk /dev/sd?
2011-09-05T16:58:00.000Z	usr13	supNow	But it shouldn't matter really, windows SHOULD see the drive, no matter what the filesystem.  You must have some sort of hardware configuration problem.
2011-09-05T16:59:00.000Z	usr13	supNow	Again:  What kind of drive is it? And which one is it?  /dev/sd?
2011-09-05T16:59:00.000Z	usr13	supNow	sudo fdisk -l   | pastebinit
2011-09-05T17:04:00.000Z	usr13	supNow	What is wrong with VNC?
2011-09-05T17:05:00.000Z	usr13	supNow	What VNC server and client did you use?  And was it from linux to ms or ms to linux?
2011-09-05T17:05:00.000Z	usr13	supNow	How fast is your network?
2011-09-05T17:07:00.000Z	usr13	supNow	I asked what client and server software you used..... ??????
2011-09-05T17:07:00.000Z	usr13	supNow	If it worked perfectly, what is your question / problem?
2011-09-05T17:08:00.000Z	usr13	supNow	So you have a hardware problem with your HD.
2011-09-05T17:08:00.000Z	usr13	supNow	?
