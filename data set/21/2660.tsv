2012-07-26T22:44:00.000Z	trism	zetheroo	the wallpapers section is controlled by the xml files in /usr/share/gnome-background-properties/ and ~/.local/share/gnome-background-properties/ (for user wallpaper sets)

2012-07-26T23:05:00.000Z	zetheroo	trism	I copied all my wallpapers to /usr/share/backgrounds .. but they are still not showing up in the Wallpapers dialog
2012-07-26T23:06:00.000Z	trism	zetheroo	because of what I just said..., look at the xml files in /usr/share/gnome-background-properties/
2012-07-26T23:07:00.000Z	zetheroo	trism	there are two files in there ... precise-wallpapers.xml and ubuntu-wallpapers.xml   .... which one should be modified?
2012-07-26T23:08:00.000Z	trism	zetheroo	neither, you can add your own
2012-07-26T23:09:00.000Z	zetheroo	trism	but it looks like each and every wallpaper has a section to itself in the xml file ... is there any way to automatically generate this or do you have to write it out manually?
2012-07-26T23:09:00.000Z	trism	zetheroo	just copy the ubuntu-wallpapers.xml one and add your own <wallpaper> entries (you only need the <name> and <filename> subtags, maybe <options>zoom</options> too)
2012-07-26T23:10:00.000Z	zetheroo	trism	I have around 50 wallpapers .. that is going to take way too long ... is this really the only way to do it? It used to work so much better in past releases of Ubuntu ... :P
2012-07-26T23:10:00.000Z	trism	zetheroo	you could automatically generate it, I don't know how to the packages do it, but you could try: apt-get source ubuntu-wallpapers; and take a look, might have scripts
2012-07-26T23:11:00.000Z	trism	zetheroo	it would be pretty simple to write a python script or whatever to do it as well
2012-07-26T23:12:00.000Z	zetheroo	trism	this should be possible without having to manually edit xml files or write python scripts - this is a very basic feature which was working previously in Ubuntu and now seems to be broken
2012-07-26T23:14:00.000Z	trism	zetheroo	then file a bug
2012-09-20T21:58:00.000Z	trism	zetheroo	I wouldn't get too attached to it anyway, the feature was removed in 3.5
2012-09-20T21:58:00.000Z	zetheroo	trism	I find it ludicrous that the option of remembering the dual pane mode was completely removed!
2012-09-20T21:59:00.000Z	trism	zetheroo	no, I mean dual pane was removed (so I suppose no option too)
2012-09-20T22:00:00.000Z	zetheroo	trism	so dual pane is completely removed in 3.5?
2012-09-20T22:00:00.000Z	trism	zetheroo	yep
2012-09-20T22:01:00.000Z	zetheroo	trism	gosh, what are they doing!? Maybe Canonical will have to come up with their own file manager
2012-09-20T22:01:00.000Z	trism	zetheroo	yeah there is quite the discussion about it on the unity-design and ubuntu-desktop mailing lists
2012-09-20T22:01:00.000Z	trism	zetheroo	offtopic here though
