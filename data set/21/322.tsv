2012-03-13T16:06:00.000Z	gvo	broglin	can you remove and reinstall it?
2012-03-13T16:06:00.000Z	broglin	gvo	no, the machine is 5km away
2012-03-13T16:07:00.000Z	gvo	broglin	OK then dmesg | more and find what device the usb drive has become.
2012-03-13T16:07:00.000Z	gvo	broglin	then mount manually
2012-03-13T16:07:00.000Z	gvo	broglin	are you sure it's not mounted?

2012-03-13T16:09:00.000Z	gvo		Right the next line might be more useful.

2012-03-13T16:10:00.000Z	gvo		Something like that one.

2012-03-13T16:10:00.000Z	gvo		It's a few more lines down.
2012-03-13T16:11:00.000Z	gvo		see if there is a sdc: sdc1 or something similar.
2012-03-13T16:11:00.000Z	broglin	gvo	sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdc did the job :-)
