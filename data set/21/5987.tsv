2007-07-27T14:44:00.000Z	blairellis		Anyone help me get my monitor to display the correct settings?
2007-07-27T14:44:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	blairellis	I can try, what do you need?
2007-07-27T14:45:00.000Z	blairellis	d4rkmonkey	Im stuck at 1024*768 where my monitor goes to 1440*900
2007-07-27T14:45:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	blairellis	try running sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-07-27T14:45:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	blairellis	change the settings in there if you need to
2007-07-27T14:45:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	blairellis	thats probably one of the easiest ways.
2007-07-27T14:47:00.000Z	blairellis	d4rkmonkey	sweet :)
2007-07-27T14:55:00.000Z	blairellis	d4rkmonkey	nada
2007-07-27T14:55:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	blairellis	? after you did that did you try restarting your X server? (ctrl+alt+backspace)
2007-07-27T14:56:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	blairellis	you could always try actually editing the xserver file, I'm not too familiar with it though
2007-07-27T14:57:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	blairellis	I gave you IIRC? lol I don't know what that is... have you tried directly editing the xorg.conf file?
2007-07-27T14:57:00.000Z	blairellis	d4rkmonkey	IIRC = If I Remember Correctly
2007-07-27T14:59:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	blairellis	try editing /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-07-27T14:59:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	blairellis	I'm not very familiar with that file though
2007-07-27T15:32:00.000Z	blairellis	d4rkmonkey	got the resolution changed, but now I have no menu bar to minimize maximize and close the windows, much less move them around the desktop
2007-07-27T15:32:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	blairellis	thats weird, how did you get the resolution changed?
2007-07-27T15:33:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	blairellis	hmmm I'm not sure what to do... That happens to me if I try to use compiz..
2007-07-27T15:33:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	blairellis	did you backup your xorg first?
2007-07-27T15:34:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	blairellis	if not, check the file for an older xorg file, mine auto-backed up a bunch when i was working on it
2007-07-27T15:34:00.000Z	blairellis	d4rkmonkey	yes, but I dont know how I could get it back...I have no CLI that I can use
2007-07-27T15:34:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	blairellis	try restarting into recovery mode
