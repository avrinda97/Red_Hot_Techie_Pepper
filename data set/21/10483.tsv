2005-03-18T10:10:00.000Z	johnnybezak		hey guys i want to rename a bunch of files without doing it individually, i need to remove some numbers at the end of the filename, anyone got any ideas (ex. image.jpg.1 to image1.jpg
2005-03-18T10:10:00.000Z	johnnybezak		)
2005-03-18T10:11:00.000Z	Levander	johnnybezak	for i in `ls *.[1234] ` ; do mv $i `basename $i .[1234] ` ; done - that's basically it
2005-03-18T10:11:00.000Z	johnnybezak	Levander	can you explain what the for i in does? i see it all the time in bash scripts
2005-03-18T10:13:00.000Z	johnnybezak	Levander	thanks *gets bash scripting guide out* hehe
2005-03-18T10:15:00.000Z	johnnybezak	Levander	yeah its cool I'll just reread the for loops section of the bash scripting guide form tldp.org
2005-03-18T10:17:00.000Z	Levander	johnnybezak	found tldp, yeah i used to use that stuff all the time.  The HOWTO's are always to broad and in-depth for what i need.
2005-03-18T10:18:00.000Z	Levander	johnnybezak	i like short tutorials that cover pretty much what i'm trying to do
2005-03-18T10:18:00.000Z	johnnybezak	Levander	haha yeah the guides are pretty sweet
2005-03-18T10:18:00.000Z	Levander	johnnybezak	maybe they got better though, haven't used them in years
2005-03-18T10:18:00.000Z	johnnybezak	Levander	haha lucky you, i need big slow with lots of examples :)
2005-03-18T10:19:00.000Z	Levander	johnnybezak	u get to a point where basic tutorials are annoying and can't do without intermediate tutorials
2005-03-18T10:19:00.000Z	johnnybezak	Levander	yeah i know what you mean
2005-03-18T10:19:00.000Z	Levander	johnnybezak	how long u been playing w computer-geek stuff?
2005-03-18T10:20:00.000Z	johnnybezak	Levander	when i type in that loop you gave me it says
2005-03-18T10:20:00.000Z	Levander	johnnybezak	i was giving u the idea, it's far from complete
2005-03-18T10:21:00.000Z	johnnybezak	Levander	ok I'll go see if I can work it out :) tahnks for your help
