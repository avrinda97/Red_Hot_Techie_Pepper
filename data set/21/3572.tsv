2009-09-20T07:42:00.000Z	mezquitale		anyone knows what port is safe to use on a bit torrent??  The ports I am trying are blocked by my ISP
2009-09-20T07:43:00.000Z	Determinist	mezquitale	which ones have you tried and which one is your ISP?
2009-09-20T07:44:00.000Z	Determinist	mezquitale	it could be something else and not your ISP. are you behind a firewall? do you have a router?
2009-09-20T07:47:00.000Z	Determinist	mezquitale	could still be it, tho. the best way to check would be not using the router and testing with your modem directly connected to one of the machines. you could also set up port forwarding on your NAT, or DMZ. i doubt your ISP can block bittorrent ports, since bittorrent doesn't use any single well known port (and if your client does, that can be changed)
2009-09-20T07:47:00.000Z	mezquitale	Determinist	what port do you use??
2009-09-20T07:47:00.000Z	Determinist	mezquitale	your ISP can use traffic shaping, but that's different.
2009-09-20T07:47:00.000Z	Determinist	mezquitale	57265
2009-09-20T07:49:00.000Z	mezquitale	Determinist	TCP port 57265 closed on MYIP
2009-09-20T07:49:00.000Z	Determinist	mezquitale	myip?
2009-09-20T07:50:00.000Z	mezquitale	Determinist	it's an ip of the form *.*.*.* where * = # from 1-254
2009-09-20T07:51:00.000Z	Determinist	mezquitale	you can't be serious. i just talked to you about NAT, DMZ and port forwarding and you're telling me what an IP address is? i'm asking what MYIP is... not what an IP address is.
2009-09-20T07:54:00.000Z	mezquitale	Determinist	LoL you want to know my ip?
2009-09-20T07:55:00.000Z	Determinist	mezquitale	no mate, i simply didn't understand what you meant up there :)
2009-09-20T07:56:00.000Z	Determinist	mezquitale	erm, i write code for a living O.o
2009-09-20T07:57:00.000Z	mezquitale	Determinist	no dice, I have to configure a port in my router to be able to use a bit torrent client???
2009-09-20T07:57:00.000Z	Determinist	mezquitale	yeah, that's quite common if you're behind a NAT
2009-09-20T07:58:00.000Z	mezquitale	Determinist	it used to work fine though with my linksys router
2009-09-20T07:58:00.000Z	Determinist	mezquitale	i usually set up one of my machines as DMZ and run bittorrent from there.
2009-09-20T07:58:00.000Z	Determinist	mezquitale	too many variables, not sure what you had, but trying to lead you to a possible solution to what you're having right now.
2009-09-20T07:59:00.000Z	mezquitale	Determinist	thanks, I'll take a look into my router later but first im going to see if it works on my neighbor's wireless, what are neighbors with open wireless for?
2009-09-20T08:00:00.000Z	Determinist	mezquitale	be fair tho :)
