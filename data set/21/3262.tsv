2009-02-13T00:26:00.000Z	voed22cj		Hi everyone. One question: I have ubuntu installed on my laptop and I have a problem regarding the SOUND. When I plug the headphones in, still, the sound comes out through the laptop speakers as well. This didn't happen in Windows. Does anyone know how to fix it? Thanks
2009-02-13T00:28:00.000Z	SiDi	voed22cj	may you type '      lspci | grep -i "audio"       ' in a terminal and paste the output ?
2009-02-13T00:31:00.000Z	SiDi	voed22cj	may you also tell me the exact model of your laptop ?
2009-02-13T00:32:00.000Z	SiDi	voed22cj	be as accurate as you can. there are a lot of sony and all of them don't have the same version of the audio chipset you're using ;)
2009-02-13T00:33:00.000Z	voed22cj	SiDi	sure, thanks
2009-02-13T00:38:00.000Z	SiDi	voed22cj	a last command, sorry  : cat /proc/asound/card0/codec\#* | grep Codec
2009-02-13T00:39:00.000Z	voed22cj	SiDi	to type it in terminal?
2009-02-13T00:39:00.000Z	SiDi	voed22cj	yes. it's to know the exact version of the audio chipset. all the vaio's don't use the same
2009-02-13T00:40:00.000Z	voed22cj	SiDi	here it is Codec: Realtek ALC262
2009-02-13T00:40:00.000Z	SiDi	voed22cj	okies
2009-02-13T00:41:00.000Z	SiDi	voed22cj	type the command "gksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base" in order to edit the alsa config file
2009-02-13T00:42:00.000Z	SiDi	voed22cj	at the end of the line, add :       options snd-hda-intel model=sony-assamd
2009-02-13T00:42:00.000Z	SiDi	voed22cj	then you can reboot and enjoy :) if it doesn't work (or if the whole sound disappears :P) we'll try another model
2009-02-13T00:42:00.000Z	voed22cj	SiDi	done, thanks. rebooting
2009-02-13T00:48:00.000Z	voed22cj	SiDi	Wow, thanks. it works
2009-02-13T00:48:00.000Z	SiDi	voed22cj	you're welcome :) may you remind me your model so that i add it to the french doc's database, please ?
2009-02-13T00:49:00.000Z	voed22cj	SiDi	Sony Vaio: VGN-NR11M/S
2009-02-13T00:49:00.000Z	SiDi	voed22cj	nevermind found it back :)
2009-02-13T00:49:00.000Z	SiDi	voed22cj	well thanks :D
2009-02-13T00:51:00.000Z	SiDi	voed22cj	by the way when you buy a laptop, always try to get one with an HDA intel :) it works just well with the good model
2009-02-13T00:51:00.000Z	voed22cj	SiDi	thanks for the tip. I was planning to change this one anyway in the near future
