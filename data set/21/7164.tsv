2007-05-17T06:24:00.000Z	nj786		anyone help me?
2007-05-17T06:24:00.000Z	Slart	nj786	what kind of bug?
2007-05-17T06:25:00.000Z	Slart	nj786	and you're using what? ubuntu? version? kubuntu? gnome? beryl? compiz?
2007-05-17T06:25:00.000Z	Slart	nj786	latest?
2007-05-17T06:26:00.000Z	Slart	nj786	desktop effects enables?
2007-05-17T06:26:00.000Z	Slart	nj786	sorry.. typo.. is desktop effects enabled?
2007-05-17T06:27:00.000Z	Slart	nj786	probably not then...  hold on.. I'll check what it does on my comp..
2007-05-17T06:27:00.000Z	Slart	nj786	are you using the workspace switcher in gnome? the 3 little grey boxes in the taskbar?
2007-05-17T06:28:00.000Z	Slart	nj786	it's ok.. you can change it.. I think 3 is the default..
2007-05-17T06:28:00.000Z	Slart	nj786	and when you switch workspace the taskbar disappears? crashes?
2007-05-17T06:29:00.000Z	Slart	nj786	ok.. hmm.... open a terminal and type this "tail /var/log/syslog" see if it says anything about something crashing, stopping etc
2007-05-17T06:30:00.000Z	Slart	nj786	just for your information, I can switch back and forth without the panel disappearing... but let's find out what's wrong
2007-05-17T06:31:00.000Z	Slart	nj786	sounds like something is wrong with Gnome... wonder if you can just reinstall gnome..
2007-05-17T06:33:00.000Z	Slart	nj786	hmm..  your system crashed because you were transfering files using gaim?? .. doesn't sound like it was very stable to begin with
2007-05-17T06:34:00.000Z	Slart	nj786	sounds like something was broken before and sounds like something is broken now.. did you install from the same CD both times?
2007-05-17T07:39:00.000Z	Slart	nj786	ubotu is a bot
2007-05-17T07:40:00.000Z	Slart	nj786	he's clever and all.. but he's a bit challenged when it comes to the creative stuff.. =)
2007-05-17T07:41:00.000Z	Slart	nj786	I don't have any easy fixes.. I would reinstall gnome.. or possibly they whole thing (ubuntu that is)
2007-05-17T07:42:00.000Z	Slart	nj786	if you're still talking about the desktop switcher problem
