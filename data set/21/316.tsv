2012-03-05T09:31:00.000Z	Ronin10101		i have ubuntu 11.04 and kubuntu 10.04\
2012-03-05T09:31:00.000Z	Ronin10101		but kubuntu is 64bit
2012-03-05T09:31:00.000Z	Ronin10101		and thats not my architecture
2012-03-05T09:31:00.000Z	Ronin10101		for some reason my 64but os was only one to work before i bricked it
2012-03-05T09:32:00.000Z	Ronin10101		because i broke my 32 bit install first
2012-03-05T09:32:00.000Z	Ronin10101		i have like 10 partitions at least...
2012-03-05T09:32:00.000Z	Ronin10101		so installing in a fresh one will be no problem
2012-03-05T09:32:00.000Z	Ronin10101		just need to figure out how to load disk image from my ipod in bios
2012-03-05T09:32:00.000Z	Ronin10101		i installed using unetbootin
2012-03-05T09:34:00.000Z	Ronin10101		the reason my current install is bricked is because x cannot find the right protocol
2012-03-05T09:35:00.000Z	celthunder	Ronin10101	x not working isnt a brick a brick is when you wreck to an unfixable point
2012-03-05T09:36:00.000Z	Ronin10101	celthunder	theres a lot more wrong than that i believe
2012-03-05T09:36:00.000Z	celthunder	Ronin10101	then how did you install it
2012-03-05T09:36:00.000Z	Ronin10101	celthunder	shouldnt boot
2012-03-05T09:39:00.000Z	celthunder	Ronin10101	is your ipod fs available even from that point
2012-03-05T09:40:00.000Z	Ronin10101	celthunder	my ipod was listed in the bios, it is functioning as an external hard drive, how can i find its init file location
2012-03-05T09:41:00.000Z	celthunder	Ronin10101	i suck once in initramfs id boot to it from grub and fix the install in a chroot
2012-03-05T09:43:00.000Z	celthunder	Ronin10101	just edit the current one putting your ipods kernel and rootfs in place of the one defaulted
2012-03-05T09:44:00.000Z	celthunder	Ronin10101	hd(drive. partition)
2012-03-05T09:59:00.000Z	Ronin10101	celthunder	Should I install grub to my ipod to make this easier? my brain hurts
2012-03-05T10:20:00.000Z	celthunder	Ronin10101	why would that make it easier
