2010-10-12T08:49:00.000Z	Datz		is there a room for ubuntu's netbook edition?
2010-10-12T08:49:00.000Z	Datz		!netbook
2010-10-12T08:49:00.000Z	Datz		ok
2010-10-12T08:50:00.000Z	Datz		well, the netbook interface didn't install.. I forget what it is called now.  Should I just try to reinstall it?
2010-10-12T08:51:00.000Z	gollum211	Datz	What do you see now on your netbook?
2010-10-12T08:51:00.000Z	Datz	gollum211	ok, guess unity didn't install. just looks like plain 10.10 gnome now
2010-10-12T08:52:00.000Z	gollum211	Datz	type: dpkg --list unity*
2010-10-12T08:52:00.000Z	Datz	gollum211	ok, well I guess it is installed, but is not loaded or something
2010-10-12T08:52:00.000Z	Datz	gollum211	I'll check
2010-10-12T08:52:00.000Z	gollum211	Datz	you want to see Unity, right?
2010-10-12T08:53:00.000Z	Datz	gollum211	yes
2010-10-12T08:55:00.000Z	gollum211	Datz	Try typing: sudo apt-get install unity
2010-10-12T08:55:00.000Z	Datz	gollum211	when I run "unity" I get some failures
2010-10-12T08:55:00.000Z	gollum211		About 2D -v- 3D?
2010-10-12T08:55:00.000Z	Datz	gollum211	says installed, and at newest
2010-10-12T08:56:00.000Z	Datz	gollum211	this is in a VM, and not a netbook btw. I don't know if it matters
2010-10-12T08:56:00.000Z	gollum211	Datz	I think it does, because your VM's graphics driver may have issues with 3D.  See this bug report: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-translations/+bug/614088
2010-10-12T08:57:00.000Z	Datz	gollum211	ok thanks. I'll have a look
2010-10-12T08:58:00.000Z	Datz	gollum211	yes, that looks to be the problem as far as I can tell. thanks.
2010-10-12T08:58:00.000Z	Datz		I don't think 3D is available by default
2010-10-12T08:59:00.000Z	Datz	gollum211	anyway, unity is just some add on to gnome?
