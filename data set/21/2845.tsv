2009-09-24T14:51:00.000Z	TheNEWman		If i am doing root do I need to be in the root account?
2009-09-24T14:52:00.000Z	TheNEWman		Thanks Tarthen  and jrib, if I need to change the root account, do I need to be logged in to root?
2009-09-24T14:54:00.000Z	TheNEWman		So if someone hacks an account on a system the can get control of root.. or do root things?
2009-09-24T14:55:00.000Z	TheNEWman		How do I define who can sudo and who cant?
2009-09-24T14:56:00.000Z	TheNEWman		arrrrggg ok,  I will check the site.
2009-09-24T14:56:00.000Z	TheNEWman		Thanks guys.
2009-09-24T14:57:00.000Z	TheNEWman		By the way, While I am here, is there a way to connect 5 or 10 monitors and keyboard/mouse combos to a ubuntu box?  I have a coffee shop and this would be a cheap way to add free Internet surfing.
2009-09-24T14:58:00.000Z	Jyxt	TheNEWman	you mean multiple monitors/keyboard/mouse per 1 machine?
2009-09-24T14:59:00.000Z	Jyxt	TheNEWman	well first you'd need a reasonably powerful machine...and second you should look into virtualization ala vmware or virtualbox
2009-09-24T15:00:00.000Z	Jyxt	TheNEWman	yes...but to push a different gui to each user
2009-09-24T15:01:00.000Z	Jyxt	TheNEWman	and you'd want some semblance of security going on..ie you woudlnt want customer A to see what customer B is doing would you
2009-09-24T15:01:00.000Z	Jyxt	TheNEWman	i know you can buy a hardware kvm switch, but i think thats to share multiple machines against a single monitor/mouse/keyboard
2009-09-24T15:04:00.000Z	Jyxt	TheNEWman	lol, you had a hadr time changing your password and your undertaking this?
2009-09-24T15:05:00.000Z	Jyxt	TheNEWman	outside of the processor to handle whatever workload they are doing...you'd need to invest in some decent gfx cards
2009-09-24T15:06:00.000Z	Jyxt	TheNEWman	probably with like 4 gfx cards, cards with dual outs...one monitor per user then just configure the xorg.conf to run multiple monitors and multilple cards...then you'd have to go thru and disable each monitor from changing to another monitor and all that stuf
