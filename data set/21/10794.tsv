2004-11-07T09:39:00.000Z	krunk-		so, if you install a package in ubuntu does it automagically appear in the start menu? Also are the mime types well set up by default, e.g., click a *.wmv and the media player pops open?
2004-11-07T09:39:00.000Z	krunk-		is there a distro that does so?
2004-11-07T09:40:00.000Z	krunk-		ok, conflicting answers hehe
2004-11-07T09:41:00.000Z	krunk-		lets say it's the basics, e.g., I don't care if the default media player is used as long as it plays files automagically. The want to install all the little games packages, but don't kow how to dig for them so they need to be in the menu
2004-11-07T09:42:00.000Z	kensai	krunk-	lots of game can be executed through the terminal just wrinting their names
2004-11-07T09:43:00.000Z	krunk-	kensai	I know, but this is for a true newb
2004-11-07T09:45:00.000Z	kensai	krunk-	yeah menu entries are the best way to go but I have installed from apt a program that is called menu that adds this things automatocally some of them
2004-11-07T09:47:00.000Z	kensai	krunk-	lol
2004-11-07T09:49:00.000Z	krunk-	kensai	no
2004-11-07T09:49:00.000Z	krunk-	kensai	of course
2004-11-07T09:50:00.000Z	krunk-	kensai	if you have those types of cookies enabled (just like windows)
2004-11-07T09:50:00.000Z	krunk-	kensai	spyware is often binary in nature, such as activeX which will not work in linux
2004-11-07T09:51:00.000Z	krunk-	kensai	you can simply tighten up cookie handling and never clean.
2004-11-07T09:53:00.000Z	krunk-	kensai	it's very hard to write spyware for linux. Especially if you use only opensource apps. Afterall everyone is looking at the source and no one like spyware
2004-11-07T09:54:00.000Z	krunk-	kensai	but in theory, if you were foolish enough to install spyware on linux, it would run
2004-11-07T09:55:00.000Z	krunk-	kensai	no one would add spyware to they're package mirrors though. so you'd really have to go out of your way
2004-11-07T10:01:00.000Z	krunk-	kensai	you never *have* to install packages as root
2004-11-07T10:03:00.000Z	krunk-	kensai	yes it does, now you know the truth of linux
2004-11-07T10:27:00.000Z	krunk-	kensai	jesus christ, you own stock?
2004-11-07T10:28:00.000Z	kensai	krunk-	I've installed debian apps and they work properly
