2010-10-14T12:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	carlotolinero	right yeah
2010-10-14T12:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	carlotolinero	Compiz does not work with Unity
2010-10-14T12:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	carlotolinero	its not compatible with mutter
2010-10-14T12:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	carlotolinero	no not with Unity
2010-10-14T12:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	carlotolinero	with the normal desktop version or  KDE  or LXDE or XFCE, and so on, sure
2010-10-14T12:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	carlotolinero	ok so your on a net book?
2010-10-14T12:04:00.000Z	carlotolinero	sebsebseb	yes
2010-10-14T12:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	carlotolinero	you may want to try out Lubuntu/LXDE its nice, and more lite waight than Xubuntu/XFCE  also you can run compiz in it
2010-10-14T12:06:00.000Z	carlotolinero	sebsebseb	can i save space in that? coz im on my laptop mini :)
2010-10-14T12:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	carlotolinero	sure it won't take up that much space,  and you get good basic apps
2010-10-14T12:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	carlotolinero	by default with it
2010-10-14T12:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	carlotolinero	however if you  then want stuff that didn't come with it, can still install that or most of it
2010-10-14T12:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	carlotolinero	I mean you run Gnome and KDE apps for example inside Lubuntu/LXDE
2010-10-14T12:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	carlotolinero	can run
2010-10-14T12:08:00.000Z	carlotolinero	sebsebseb	ok thats why im having problems with unity. hehe i ddnt know that compiz theres is not compatible
2010-10-14T12:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	carlotolinero	Compiz isn't compatible with Gnome Shell either, which is nice,  currently has a development version, but Ubuntu should be using that by default with the rest of Gnome  3 next year :)
2010-10-14T12:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	carlotolinero	both Unity and Gnome Shell use mutter
2010-10-14T12:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	carlotolinero	^
