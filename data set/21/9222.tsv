2005-10-21T16:22:00.000Z	Nick_Hill		With every distro, and with most sound card drivers, MIDI appears to be an afterthought.
2005-10-21T16:23:00.000Z	Nick_Hill		The only way to change the MIDI situation os to file bug reports whenever you can't get midi to work.
2005-10-21T16:24:00.000Z	Nick_Hill		One of the great selling points of the Atari ST is that it came with built in midi ports which always worked with any program you installed.
2005-10-21T12:13:00.000Z	Nick_Hill		Reporting bugs: When I use reportbug, it sends the bug to ubuntu-users@lists.ubuntu.com. Bugs I reported get held for moderator approval. Are the bugs going into a bitbucket?
2005-10-21T12:15:00.000Z	Nick_Hill		Does Ubuntu have a bug tracking system?
2005-10-21T12:15:00.000Z	nalioth	Nick_Hill	bugzilla.ubuntu.com
2005-10-21T12:17:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	nalioth	Thanks. My bugs are being sent to ubuntu-users@lists.ubuntu.com, then being held for moderator approval (as I am not a member of that list). Do you think the system is mis-configured?
2005-10-21T12:18:00.000Z	nalioth	Nick_Hill	i use bugzilla. idk about mailing lists
2005-10-21T12:19:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	nalioth	I use reportbug. Reportbug has been configured to send to that list.
2005-10-24T15:33:00.000Z	nalioth	Nick_Hill	sudo is not necessary for ifconfig
2005-10-24T15:36:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	nalioth	ah yes. /sbin appears in a user's path on Ubuntu, but not debian. hence ifconfig is available as a user command
2005-11-05T16:31:00.000Z	nalioth	Nick_Hill	pm?
2005-11-18T10:29:00.000Z	nalioth	Nick_Hill	may i help you?
2005-11-18T10:29:00.000Z	nalioth	Nick_Hill	is there a problem?
2005-11-18T10:30:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	nalioth	Hi. The topic for discussion is using non-ascii characters. I have asked around, and it is looking corrupted for others as well. Can you change the pipe to ascii | ?
2005-11-18T10:30:00.000Z	nalioth	Nick_Hill	dont use !ops unless there is a noticeable problem. we are not your personal helpmates
2005-11-18T10:32:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	nalioth	I used !ops to determine who to tell about the corrupted topic for the group. What should I have done?
2005-11-18T10:34:00.000Z	nalioth	Nick_Hill	asked in the channel who was was an op. !ops is for emergency use
2005-11-18T10:34:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	nalioth	I have done this on two occasions in the last 20 hours.
2005-11-18T10:34:00.000Z	nalioth	Nick_Hill	is the topic suitable for you now?
2005-11-18T10:35:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	nalioth	It isn't the case of being suitable for me personally. But to look right for everybody. Thank you for makign the change.
