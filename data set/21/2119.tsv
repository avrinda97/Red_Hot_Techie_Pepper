2010-07-20T19:32:00.000Z	otswim		hi, i'm running a kubuntu live usb stick; and i'm trying to mount an external hdd to backup my files but i don't know how, i've tried almost every /dev/sdXY with X from a to c and Y from nothing to 3
2010-07-20T19:32:00.000Z	edbian	otswim	Don't just guess!  Take a look at the output of sudo fdisk -l
2010-07-20T19:33:00.000Z	edbian	otswim	What folder are you trying to mount them into?
2010-07-20T19:33:00.000Z	otswim	edbian	a freshly created one (/mnt/hdd)
2010-07-20T19:33:00.000Z	edbian	otswim	Lookin' good.
2010-07-20T19:33:00.000Z	edbian	otswim	Did sudo fdisk -l help?
2010-07-20T19:35:00.000Z	edbian	otswim	That's probably why you can't mount it.  Are you sure it's connected?  Does it have lights and such?
2010-07-20T19:36:00.000Z	edbian	otswim	How is it connected? USB?
2010-07-20T19:36:00.000Z	otswim	edbian	it has a green light; when i plug it on a windows computer, it's detected every 10 times
2010-07-20T19:36:00.000Z	edbian	otswim	It's connected every 10 times?
2010-07-20T19:38:00.000Z	otswim	edbian	right, a lot of EXT2-fs errors
2010-07-20T19:39:00.000Z	otswim	edbian	on windows it works only if i plug it and unplug it a lot
2010-07-20T19:39:00.000Z	edbian	otswim	Then I suggest you do that.  have a look at the end of dmesg.  It should change everytime you plug/unplug it.
2010-07-20T19:39:00.000Z	edbian	otswim	You should probably re-format it...
2010-07-20T19:40:00.000Z	edbian	otswim	shift + button above enter
2010-07-20T19:41:00.000Z	otswim	edbian	button above enter is backspace :p
2010-07-20T19:42:00.000Z	edbian	otswim	it's the backslash key.  I'm not sure where it is on your specific keyboard then.
2010-07-20T19:43:00.000Z	otswim	edbian	it worked now after i plugged it/unplugged it
2010-07-20T19:43:00.000Z	edbian	otswim	Great! :)
2010-07-20T19:44:00.000Z	edbian	otswim	Like I said.  Try re-formatting.
2010-07-20T19:44:00.000Z	otswim	edbian	ok thanks :)
