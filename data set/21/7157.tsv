2010-02-05T14:25:00.000Z	anodesni		About the Load Cycle bug, is it solved?
2010-02-05T14:26:00.000Z	anodesni		I want to know how it is fixed
2010-02-05T14:27:00.000Z	Slart	anodesni	I didn't experience it when it was hyped the most.. I don't experience it now.. but I haven't heard anything about it for a while.. I guess they fixed it work implemented some work-around
2010-02-05T14:28:00.000Z	anodesni	Slart	I know this workaround hparm -B 255, it prevents the hdd from parking the heads, but it destroys my hdd, since the temperature becomes very high
2010-02-05T14:28:00.000Z	Slart	anodesni	I would suggest trying a live cd and letting it run while keeping track of the hard drive params.. see if it's working or not
2010-02-05T14:29:00.000Z	anodesni	Slart	will the live cd detect the computer as laptop?
2010-02-05T14:29:00.000Z	Slart	anodesni	I'm not sure.. give it a try
2010-02-05T14:31:00.000Z	anodesni	Slart	has the daily build of 9.10 all updates? Because the basic cd does not has the fix of course
2010-02-05T14:32:00.000Z	Slart	anodesni	huh? basic cd?   I would guess that something marked as a daily build would include updates released up to today
2010-02-05T14:33:00.000Z	Slart	anodesni	ah.. I see.. I have no idea if they update the cd images every now and then.. I haven't really looked into it that hard
2010-02-05T14:36:00.000Z	Slart	anodesni	why not see if you can somehow stop ubuntu from writing the logs every 30 seconds.. that seems to be the real problem... I'm not really sure how to do this though.. perhaps there is a setting somewhere
2010-02-05T14:36:00.000Z	anodesni	Slart	what logs do you mean?
2010-02-05T14:37:00.000Z	Slart	anodesni	syslogs, kernel logs and whatnot
2010-02-05T14:37:00.000Z	anodesni	Slart	you think that  this disk activity prevents the hdd from parking heads?
2010-02-05T14:38:00.000Z	Slart	anodesni	nope.. but it keeps waking the hard drive up.. and then it goes to sleep after 20 seconds.. and has to wake up again..and so on
2010-02-05T14:38:00.000Z	anodesni	Slart	that's too much trouble for an OS. I just want it to work without decreasing the lifespan of my harddisk
2010-02-05T14:40:00.000Z	Slart	anodesni	it's possible the laptop-mode tools does this already.. I don't really know as I mostly run my laptop while connected to an outlet
2010-02-05T14:40:00.000Z	anodesni	Slart	even when connected to an outlet this increases my Load cycle count by 100 an hour
2010-02-05T14:41:00.000Z	Slart	anodesni	I'm not sure how up-to-date this info is.. but it might be worth reading through anyways https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DanielHahler/Bug59695
2010-05-20T01:55:00.000Z	anodesni	Slart	it's ok
2010-05-20T01:56:00.000Z	Slart	anodesni	hmm.. well.. if they at least throw in a good version every now and then it should be ok.. =)
