2011-05-01T19:18:00.000Z	dury		jiltdill: I told you the bios usb devicw it's ok,,, because I already boot it from it
2011-05-01T19:19:00.000Z	escott	dury	it doesn't work if you just follow the instructions substituting pendrive for cd?
2011-05-01T19:22:00.000Z	dury	escott	it boots from the usb pendrive.... the thing it's when is trying to install the apt it ask me for cd-rom
2011-05-01T19:23:00.000Z	escott	dury	i know but the pendrive should have the cd image, does it get stuck and not let you continue?
2011-05-01T19:24:00.000Z	dury	escott	that's right
2011-05-01T19:25:00.000Z	escott	dury	its stuck in the install gui right? at what point does it get stuck
2011-05-01T19:26:00.000Z	dury	escott	when s
2011-05-01T19:26:00.000Z	dury	escott	when it's to install apt module or packages or whatever
2011-05-01T19:27:00.000Z	dury	escott	sorry I mean when it's trying to install apt module or packages or whatever
2011-05-01T19:27:00.000Z	escott	dury	so its taken all your config info/partitioned folders and then gets stuck
2011-05-01T19:28:00.000Z	dury	escott	that's right
2011-05-01T19:29:00.000Z	dury	escott	are there another way to install it?
2011-05-01T19:31:00.000Z	escott	dury	i've only ever done cd installs, so im not familiar with the usb method. the only thing I could think to do would be to edit /etc/apt/sources.list to point to the repo on your usb keychain
