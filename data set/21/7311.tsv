2006-10-25T16:41:00.000Z	VanessaE		ok.  yeah, if it works with XGL it seems that AIGLX should work too, based on what I've read.

2006-10-25T16:42:00.000Z	VanessaE		I guess you could try running one of those window managers that uses xgl/aiglx and see how it ...

2006-10-25T16:44:00.000Z	VanessaE		in the "roster"?
2006-10-25T16:44:00.000Z	VanessaE		the buddy list?
2006-10-25T16:45:00.000Z	VanessaE		or use konqueror as a file mangler.
