2012-10-16T08:08:00.000Z	uw		everything gets mounted to /media
2012-10-16T08:08:00.000Z	uw		useless
2012-10-16T08:09:00.000Z	uw		yup i sure use it
2012-10-16T08:09:00.000Z	uw		but forsome reason everything auto mounts to that dumb media directory
2012-10-16T08:09:00.000Z	uw		why did that ever come about?
2012-10-16T08:09:00.000Z	uw		implimenting a media directory
2012-10-16T08:10:00.000Z	uw		10.04 did it
2012-10-16T08:10:00.000Z	uw		and now aparently 12.04 does it too
2012-10-16T08:10:00.000Z	uw		annoying
2012-10-16T08:12:00.000Z	uw		yea i just change how it mounts altogether.  which is the annoying part because i other scripts that rely on certain locations.
2012-10-16T08:14:00.000Z	DaemonicApathy	uw	The two sections are just purposed differently - /mnt is for manual mounting of devices, and /media is for automatic mounting by the system.
2012-10-16T08:15:00.000Z	DaemonicApathy	uw	I think you would have to modify that type of thing yourself.
2012-10-16T08:17:00.000Z	uw	DaemonicApathy	i see... but that's still kinda silly right?
2012-10-16T08:20:00.000Z	DaemonicApathy	uw	Looking that deeply into the system, you're bound to find sillier.
2012-10-16T08:47:00.000Z	DaemonicApathy	uw	Honestly, I wouldn't worry about those too much.
2012-10-16T09:59:00.000Z	DaemonicApathy	uw	You can always hit Ctrl+L to have those little windows turn into the text path.
2012-10-16T10:00:00.000Z	uw	DaemonicApathy	thanks again.  do you know a way i can have it so it does that by default?
2012-10-16T10:00:00.000Z	DaemonicApathy	uw	I'm orking on that...
2012-10-16T10:05:00.000Z	DaemonicApathy	uw	Try from Terminal, "gsettings set org.gnome.nautilus.preferences always-use-location-entryÂ true"
2012-10-16T10:07:00.000Z	uw	DaemonicApathy	nice man thanks.  I was just getting to where gconf is being replaced by gsettings
2012-10-16T10:08:00.000Z	DaemonicApathy	uw	I do what I can, when I can. :-)
