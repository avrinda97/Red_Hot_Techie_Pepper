2007-03-22T06:32:00.000Z	ravi_master		ali, I might now
2007-03-22T06:32:00.000Z	ravi_master		ali, adjust your ethernet interface with ethtool, was talking about it just a few seconds ago
2007-03-22T06:32:00.000Z	ravi_master		!ethtool > ali1234
2007-03-22T06:34:00.000Z	ali1234	ravi_master	i'll give it a go, but i'm not using samba
2007-03-22T06:34:00.000Z	ravi_master	ali1234	doesn't matter, ethtool is for all your network connections
2007-03-22T06:35:00.000Z	ravi_master	ali1234	where network==ethernet
2007-03-22T06:36:00.000Z	ali1234	ravi_master	i know. but for me samba connections have always been slow. most other stuff normally isn't.
2007-03-22T06:36:00.000Z	ravi_master	ali1234	if most of the other stuff is just dealing with web pages, etc, you might not realize it because of the data sizes involved.
2007-03-22T06:37:00.000Z	ali1234	ravi_master	most of the other stuff involves transfering raw digital video
2007-03-22T06:37:00.000Z	ravi_master	ali1234	try ifconfig and see if you have any errors
2007-03-22T06:37:00.000Z	ali1234	ravi_master	no errors
2007-03-22T06:38:00.000Z	ravi_master	ali1234	so you are saying you have a problem with samba connecting to an external server, correct?
2007-03-22T06:38:00.000Z	ravi_master	ali1234	check that the settings on the other end, on the server, are good too.
2007-03-22T06:38:00.000Z	ali1234	ravi_master	no, not at all. i'm not using samba at all
2007-03-22T06:38:00.000Z	ravi_master	ali1234	then please explain your problem clearly.
2007-03-22T06:39:00.000Z	ali1234	ravi_master	the problem is that any kind of tcp/ip connection will stall after about 50kb, and the total maximum throughput of the 100mbit card is currently 4kbyte/sec
2007-03-22T06:39:00.000Z	ali1234	ravi_master	as in, http, ftp, ssh, anything really
2007-03-22T06:41:00.000Z	ali1234	ravi_master	3, not including the ones that are turned off. and one is the router.
2007-03-22T06:41:00.000Z	ravi_master	ali1234	and what about that 1 other computer you have, can you connect to everything from there fine?
2007-03-22T06:43:00.000Z	ravi_master	ali1234	none of the other computers on this network have a problem?
