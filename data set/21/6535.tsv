2007-04-03T14:31:00.000Z	gordonjcp		ah, I remember knoppix...
2007-04-03T14:32:00.000Z	gordonjcp		iirc
2007-04-03T14:33:00.000Z	cables_	gordonjcp	hi, back, using scree.n
2007-04-03T14:33:00.000Z	gordonjcp	cables_	hello
2007-04-03T14:33:00.000Z	gordonjcp	cables_	see?  now you can do this...
2007-04-03T14:33:00.000Z	cables_	gordonjcp	what should I be looking for in the output of that command?
2007-04-03T14:33:00.000Z	cables_	gordonjcp	I know
2007-04-03T14:33:00.000Z	cables_	gordonjcp	I can work Screen just fine
2007-04-03T14:34:00.000Z	gordonjcp	cables_	see?  I know you didn't see much, but I just hopped across to my laptop
2007-04-03T14:34:00.000Z	gordonjcp	cables_	uhm right, let's see
2007-04-03T14:34:00.000Z	gordonjcp	cables_	what did "ps ax | grep dbus" say?
2007-04-03T14:34:00.000Z	cables_	gordonjcp	I'd paste it, but I'm in a vtty... i'll try to summarize it
2007-04-03T14:35:00.000Z	gordonjcp	cables_	about four or five lines, with a couple of /usr/bin/dbus-daemon lines?
2007-04-03T14:35:00.000Z	cables_	gordonjcp	5 processes running
2007-04-03T14:35:00.000Z	gordonjcp	cables_	fine, that's working
2007-04-03T14:35:00.000Z	cables_	gordonjcp	yeah, that's what I see
2007-04-03T14:35:00.000Z	gordonjcp	cables_	silly question, but have you tried just restarting X?
2007-04-03T14:36:00.000Z	cables_	gordonjcp	I'd rather not do that... but it's been more than 3 minutes, and OpenOffice has autosaved, so I think it's safe to do that now :)
2007-04-03T14:36:00.000Z	gordonjcp	cables_	ok, cool, you know about CTRL-ALT-BACKSPACE?
2007-04-03T14:36:00.000Z	cables_	gordonjcp	yep
2007-04-03T14:36:00.000Z	gordonjcp	cables_	it's hard to tell sometimes in here ;-)
