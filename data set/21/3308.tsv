2009-02-18T21:15:00.000Z	n8tuserf		Dimitar-> if you have a livecd of the newer 8.10 you can install that freshly
2009-02-18T21:16:00.000Z	n8tuserf		Dimitar-> even in the livecd? you get a busybox prompt?
2009-02-18T21:17:00.000Z	n8tuserf		smokeytheman-> i have not tried before, but try sudo apt-get reinstall dpkg
2009-02-18T21:17:00.000Z	n8tuserf		Dimitar-> that tells me your livecd burn is no good..
2009-02-18T21:17:00.000Z	n8tuserf		!who | Dimitar
2009-02-18T21:18:00.000Z	n8tuserf		smokeytheman-> i told you i have not reinstalled a dpkg  package
2009-02-18T21:19:00.000Z	n8tuserf		Dimitar-> still, it could have been a bad burn, they didnt have qA working that time :P
2009-02-18T21:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	n8tuserf	smokeytheman apt uses dpkg to install if dpkg is broken apt does not work....
2009-02-23T04:37:00.000Z	n8tuserf	erUSUL	-> the national indonesian language is called bahasa
2009-02-23T04:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	n8tuserf	nice to know but the channel is #ubuntu-id
2009-03-06T05:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	n8tuserf	update-initramfs ? mkinitramfs ?
2009-03-06T05:46:00.000Z	n8tuserf	erUSUL	-> mkinitramfs
2009-03-06T05:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	n8tuserf	well i use it for building the initrd's of the vanilla kernels i compile... but i do not configure it specially i just do "sudo mkinitramfs -o /boot/initrd.img-kernel_version kernel_version"
2009-03-06T05:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	n8tuserf	where kernel_version is 2.6.29-rc7 for example
2009-03-06T05:56:00.000Z	n8tuserf	erUSUL	-> i got disconnected..
2009-03-06T05:56:00.000Z	n8tuserf	erUSUL	-> umm I forgot to mention when copying  devices into /dev/   there are no /dev/ramdisk to copy over so i wonder if thats the cause of failure..
2009-03-06T05:56:00.000Z	n8tuserf	erUSUL	-> perhaps i should rephrase, when you create your initrd, which /dev/ram*  do you copy over?
2009-03-06T05:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	n8tuserf	as i said i just run the command i do not modify its behavior in any way
2009-03-06T05:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	n8tuserf	 i just do "sudo mkinitramfs -o /boot/initrd.img-kernel_version kernel_version"
2009-03-06T05:57:00.000Z	n8tuserf	erUSUL	-> oh okay, i thought you have customized it.. thanks for the response
2009-03-06T05:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	n8tuserf	take alook in /etc/initramfs-tools/
