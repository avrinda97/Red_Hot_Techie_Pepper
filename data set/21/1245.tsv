2010-12-24T19:23:00.000Z	meco		How do I capture a browser window (including the part that doesn't show on the screen)?
2010-12-24T19:24:00.000Z	rs0832	meco	do you mean the page you are viewing or the just the browser window and what's visible in it?
2010-12-24T19:25:00.000Z	meco	rs0832	I mean the browser window as far as it extends beyond the screen.
2010-12-24T19:26:00.000Z	rs0832	meco	well there are some screen capture programs that can capture a specified window...
2010-12-24T19:26:00.000Z	rs0832	meco	so it should capture the window, irrespective of where it is
2010-12-24T19:26:00.000Z	meco	rs0832	Do you know of any names?
2010-12-24T19:28:00.000Z	rs0832	meco	i am not sure which of these has the feature or if all of them do.. but you can try them
2010-12-24T19:30:00.000Z	rs0832	meco	!screencast
2010-12-24T19:31:00.000Z	meco	rs0832	But those seem all to be recording programs. I'm just looking for an app to make an image
2010-12-24T19:39:00.000Z	rs0832	meco	you can take a small vid of the window and then use pitivi to get the single pic
2010-12-24T19:40:00.000Z	meco	rs0832	In Windows it is possible to just take a snapshot of the webpage. Making a video first sounds complicated (at least to me since I haven't done that before)
2010-12-24T19:41:00.000Z	rs0832	meco	if you want the webpage, just save it.. i only know of windows having one called camstudio
2010-12-25T16:38:00.000Z	rs0832	meco	did you try updating?
2010-12-25T16:38:00.000Z	meco	rs0832	I'll try that.
2010-12-25T16:38:00.000Z	rs0832	meco	oj
2010-12-25T16:38:00.000Z	rs0832	meco	ok*
2010-12-25T16:43:00.000Z	meco	rs0832	I updated with no effect. It may not be related, but Firefox behaves odd also: even though its settings is to preserve windows when restarting, it reopens with Google's search page.
2010-12-25T16:43:00.000Z	rs0832	meco	hmm.. did you try disabling and re-enabling that feature?
2010-12-25T16:44:00.000Z	meco	rs0832	No, I'll try that
2010-12-25T16:56:00.000Z	meco	rs0832	Disable/enable did the trick!
2010-12-25T16:56:00.000Z	rs0832	meco	k great :)
