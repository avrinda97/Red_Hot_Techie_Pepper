2012-07-13T07:05:00.000Z	epimeth		so no takers on ubuntu tv?
2012-07-13T07:05:00.000Z	TheDruidsKeeper	epimeth	i'm looking at the site now on that, hadn't seen it before
2012-07-13T07:07:00.000Z	epimeth	TheDruidsKeeper	yea I read about it a little while back and when I decided to build a media box a month ago I figured it might be fun to try... however its not really ready yet, I don't think... will probably install xbmc as a stopgap
2012-07-13T07:08:00.000Z	epimeth	TheDruidsKeeper	As a web developer, I can't back that up completely... html5 still has a LONG way to go, as I painfully learned this month trying to create a specialized video player
2012-07-13T07:08:00.000Z	TheDruidsKeeper	epimeth	i set my htpc up with mythbuntu.. it's good, but not overly impressive
2012-07-13T07:10:00.000Z	TheDruidsKeeper	epimeth	it does still have a long way to go, but all signs point to it being the future. adobe has announced that they will not be porting flash to any new platforms, and google is pushing html5. for the past decade google has been setting the standards, and i would expect that trend to continue
2012-07-13T07:11:00.000Z	epimeth	TheDruidsKeeper	I totally agree, but if the current rate of adoption continues we still have a long way to go... and until then flash is the only solution for many things
2012-07-13T07:12:00.000Z	TheDruidsKeeper	epimeth	what kind of web dev do you do?
2012-07-13T07:13:00.000Z	epimeth	TheDruidsKeeper	that is actually not true.... read up on it a little more, you'll see that that claim is true in that chrome is the most widely used browser by counting individual page hits, not by counting individual users.  meaning chrome users surf more, but IE is still installed more
2012-07-13T07:13:00.000Z	TheDruidsKeeper	epimeth	touche
2012-07-13T07:14:00.000Z	epimeth	TheDruidsKeeper	I'm frontend and backend, and can administer a server.  Mostly LAMP, but comfy with WAMP and have dabbled in .NET/IIS (tho lord knows I would never use it unless absolutely necessary... every day I use it I like it less)
2012-07-13T07:18:00.000Z	epimeth	TheDruidsKeeper	well I have a blackmagic intensity card, their software should take care of my live tv recording needs, no?
2012-07-13T07:19:00.000Z	TheDruidsKeeper	epimeth	thats just for capture, but the software is still needed for record & playback
2012-07-13T07:20:00.000Z	TheDruidsKeeper	epimeth	http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=HOW-TO:Watch_TV_in_XBMC it looks like xbmc doesn't even handle decoding live streams either
2012-07-13T07:21:00.000Z	epimeth	TheDruidsKeeper	well thats what I'm saying... the blackmagic software should handle the recording/playback and I can just watch from there, no?
2012-07-13T07:22:00.000Z	epimeth	TheDruidsKeeper	And I preordered a LeapMotion so once that gets here I'll put it on my coffee table and be AWESOME :-D
2012-07-13T07:27:00.000Z	TheDruidsKeeper	epimeth	it looks like you should be able to use xbmc with the blackmagic pvr.. i'm using a tv capture card in mine, so i guess my setup is pretty different
2012-07-13T07:27:00.000Z	TheDruidsKeeper	epimeth	 that leapmotion will be pretty intense though :D
2012-07-13T07:34:00.000Z	epimeth	TheDruidsKeeper	yes it will :-D ... hope they aren't lying when they say they will release with linux support :-(
2012-07-13T07:34:00.000Z	TheDruidsKeeper	epimeth	guess you'll find out soon enough ;)
2012-07-13T07:36:00.000Z	epimeth	TheDruidsKeeper	not soon enough... I'll give you 3:1 odds they don't ship before the new year!
