2006-03-30T16:24:00.000Z	laffer		how do I set up virtual hosts?
2006-03-30T16:25:00.000Z	ic56	laffer	ifconfig eth0:<virtual host> <address> ..
2006-03-30T16:35:00.000Z	ic56	laffer	you mean, on the client?  or on the server's side?
2006-03-30T16:36:00.000Z	laffer	ic56	on the client. but can I create on ubuntu vhosts and use them?
2006-03-30T16:39:00.000Z	ic56	laffer	irc -h <hostname or IP number>  .  I've never done it but I see no reason why the networking parts of the kernel would be different on ubuntu from all the other linux distros.
2006-03-30T16:56:00.000Z	ic56	laffer	has your ISP given you more than one IP number?  That usually costs $
2006-03-30T16:58:00.000Z	laffer	ic56	no I haven't, does that mean that I have to use someone's vhosts?
2006-03-30T16:58:00.000Z	ic56	laffer	it does.  Why do you want this, anyway?
2006-03-30T16:59:00.000Z	laffer	ic56	just for curiosity
2006-03-31T17:01:00.000Z	ic56	laffer	if you just want to see how it works, you can make it work on your home network by using private IP addresses.  The outside world cannot see you unless you're using IP numbers that have been assigned to you.
2006-03-31T17:03:00.000Z	laffer	ic56	sorry, how's that? can you explain it differently?
2006-03-31T17:05:00.000Z	ic56	laffer	you can connect several hosts in your home.  These form a local network.  So long as you don't care about them connecting to the outside world, you can givem any IP number you want.  Thus, you can create a test setup to see how virtual hosting works.
2006-03-31T17:05:00.000Z	laffer	ic56	but it just works on a LAN
2006-03-31T17:05:00.000Z	laffer	ic56	not in the outside world
2006-03-31T17:05:00.000Z	laffer	ic56	right?
2006-03-31T17:05:00.000Z	ic56	laffer	correct.
2006-03-31T17:07:00.000Z	laffer	ic56	maybe monday I'll recieve my KVM Switch and have 2 pcs running on a LAN. do you know any article explaining that? I tried to google it but can't find none.. just some related to apache web server
2006-03-31T17:10:00.000Z	ic56	laffer	sorry, no.  But it's easy.  Just ifconfig <regular ethernet device>:<1> <IP address>...  Replace `1' with `2' for the 2nd virtual host, etc.
2006-03-31T17:10:00.000Z	laffer	ic56	thanks very nice :P
2006-03-31T17:11:00.000Z	ic56	laffer	I take it you didn't see my response to your original question an hour ago?
2006-03-31T17:13:00.000Z	laffer	ic56	lol.. I saw it allright but didn't write it down :(
