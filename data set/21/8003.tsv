2006-06-30T09:00:00.000Z	J0s3ph		anyone know of a gnome applet that lists filesystems?
2006-06-30T09:00:00.000Z	ccooke	J0s3ph	System -> Administration -> Disks
2006-06-30T09:01:00.000Z	J0s3ph	ccooke	thanks, but that's not what im looking for at all unfortunately
2006-06-30T09:02:00.000Z	ccooke	J0s3ph	So what are you looking for?
2006-06-30T09:02:00.000Z	J0s3ph		id like a gnome applet that lets me browse through filesystems
2006-06-30T09:02:00.000Z	J0s3ph		so that i can click on something in the panel and itll go through the folders
2006-06-30T09:02:00.000Z	ccooke	J0s3ph	a file browser?
2006-06-30T09:03:00.000Z	J0s3ph	ccooke	in a way, but for the panel
2006-06-30T09:03:00.000Z	J0s3ph	ccooke	sort of like how kde has
2006-06-30T09:03:00.000Z	ccooke	J0s3ph	how would you browse files on the panel? there isn't enough space
2006-06-30T09:03:00.000Z	J0s3ph	ccooke	windows has this very feature, as does kde
2006-06-30T09:04:00.000Z	J0s3ph	ccooke	you'd click on the applet then the set folder is listed
2006-06-30T09:04:00.000Z	J0s3ph		think of it as a start menu but for files
2006-06-30T09:04:00.000Z	ccooke	J0s3ph	Ah. So, you mean a way of putting some folder effectively on the panel? not an *arbitrary* folder?
2006-06-30T09:04:00.000Z	J0s3ph	ccooke	yes, exactly
2006-06-30T09:05:00.000Z	J0s3ph		lets say i set the applet to list root
2006-06-30T09:05:00.000Z	J0s3ph	ccooke	 it would list it then when i goto the folders within it would then continue in a different menu
2006-06-30T09:05:00.000Z	J0s3ph		and ideally list the files within the directories at the bottom
2006-06-30T09:05:00.000Z	ccooke	J0s3ph	I see
2006-06-30T09:05:00.000Z	J0s3ph	ccooke	know anything that does that for gnome?
2006-06-30T09:08:00.000Z	J0s3ph	ccooke	nothing? :\
