2012-09-17T08:26:00.000Z	L3top		if it is static... YOU set the ip.
2012-09-17T08:26:00.000Z	L3top		its static.
2012-09-17T08:27:00.000Z	L3top		what config file are you editing?
2012-09-17T08:27:00.000Z	tortib	L3top	/etc/network/interfaces
2012-09-17T08:27:00.000Z	L3top	tortib	if you edit the file yourself... it tends to break network manager.
2012-09-17T08:28:00.000Z	tortib	L3top	wonderful
2012-09-17T08:28:00.000Z	L3top	tortib	well... this is because it uses a different file... and the interfaces file overrides that.
2012-09-17T08:29:00.000Z	tortib	L3top	let me set my IP to static in the interfaces file first to see if that works without breaking
2012-09-17T08:32:00.000Z	L3top	tortib	it must read like auto eth0  /n  iface eth0 inet static  /n  address 192.168.1.4   /n   netmask 255.255.255.0
2012-09-24T04:36:00.000Z	L3top	tortib	lspci -nnk | grep VGA -A3
2012-09-24T05:03:00.000Z	L3top	tortib	what is the output of lspci -nn | grep VGA
2012-09-24T05:05:00.000Z	L3top	tortib	lsmod | grep fglrx
2012-09-24T05:05:00.000Z	tortib	L3top	fglrx is being used
2012-09-24T05:06:00.000Z	tortib	L3top	i want to use an older version of the Driver.
2012-09-24T05:07:00.000Z	L3top	tortib	I don't think you do... I am fairly versed in gpu drivers... my guess is that there is another conflict causing the problem, and an older fglrx will only make things worse. Radeon is the open source version of the driver.
2012-09-24T05:08:00.000Z	tortib	L3top	what do you mean?
2012-09-24T05:43:00.000Z	L3top	tortib	cat /etc/X11/default-display-manager
2012-09-24T05:40:00.000Z	tortib	L3top	how can i set my main desktop and login manager to XFCE4?
2012-09-24T05:41:00.000Z	L3top	tortib	check /etc/X11/default-display-manager
2012-09-24T05:44:00.000Z	L3top	tortib	adjust the file as necessary
2012-09-24T05:48:00.000Z	tortib	L3top	nah xfce4 didn't fix it, it's shitty drivers
