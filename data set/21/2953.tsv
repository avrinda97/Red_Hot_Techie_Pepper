2009-07-12T21:13:00.000Z	fccf	vinicius	I initailly had that problem with this computer... Turns out the SATA controller acts like a IDE controller.. adding all-ide-generic to the boot prompt fixes this
2009-07-12T21:23:00.000Z	vinicius	fccf	nice... ill try it
2009-07-12T21:23:00.000Z	vinicius	fccf	its an old box
2009-07-12T21:24:00.000Z	fccf	vinicius	old box.. how old ... if it doesn't have a sata controller all-ide-generic won't do anything
2009-07-12T21:24:00.000Z	vinicius	fccf	maybe 5 years or more
2009-07-12T21:24:00.000Z	vinicius	fccf	it can boot from CD, so it can obviously read a cd
2009-07-12T21:25:00.000Z	fccf	vinicius	mine will boot from cd ... then drop to busybox... unless I use the generic ... not sure ... do you know if you have SATA or IDE harddrives?
2009-07-12T21:27:00.000Z	vinicius	fccf	not sure... ill check on the bios
2009-07-12T21:36:00.000Z	vinicius	fccf	how can i enable the generc mode?
2009-07-12T21:37:00.000Z	fccf	vinicius	when you get to the pretty page where it asks for language you can add other options to the boot line ... add all-ide-generic
2009-07-12T21:38:00.000Z	vinicius	fccf	pressing F6 right?
2009-07-12T21:39:00.000Z	fccf	vinicius	Yep
2009-07-12T21:48:00.000Z	vinicius	fccf	ok... that actually didnt work
2009-07-12T21:48:00.000Z	fccf	vinicius	worth a try
2009-07-12T21:48:00.000Z	vinicius	fccf	but now at least  dmesg stops in a different level
2009-07-12T21:48:00.000Z	vinicius	fccf	when it detects usb slots
2009-07-12T21:49:00.000Z	vinicius	fccf	i had to add generic.all_generic_ide=1
2009-07-12T21:49:00.000Z	fccf	vinicius	different ways of saying the same thing
2009-07-12T21:49:00.000Z	vinicius	fccf	ok... =)
2009-07-12T21:50:00.000Z	fccf	vinicius	not sure what to tell you, and I have to go,,, good luck
2009-07-12T21:50:00.000Z	vinicius	fccf	ok... thankf for the help
