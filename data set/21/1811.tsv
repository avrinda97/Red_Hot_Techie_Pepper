2010-07-05T06:08:00.000Z	tarandus		Ubuntu installed properly, then it downloaded 200+ updates. After installing those updates and rebooting, it simply is not connecting to the internet anymore. It was connecting fine before the updates. What gives?
2010-07-05T06:09:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	tarandus	hows your wifi?
2010-07-05T06:13:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	tarandus	when you first install ubuntu, it acts different than it does when you reboot without the livecd (or livedvd).  So you may have been running the drivers without even knowing it.
2010-07-05T06:14:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	tarandus	system-->administration-->hardware drivers
2010-07-05T06:15:00.000Z	tarandus	linux_is_my_hero	i am there
2010-07-05T06:16:00.000Z	tarandus	linux_is_my_hero	It searched for drivers, and now a screen is up that states "No proprietary drivers are in use on this system."
2010-07-05T06:17:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	tarandus	find another way to the internet, like ethernet or a sprint or verizon wireless access card
2010-07-05T06:18:00.000Z	tarandus	linux_is_my_hero	ah, this sounds troublesome...
2010-07-05T06:19:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	tarandus	ive been thorugh the exact same thing...it sucks i bet u dont have a ethernet cable or a wireless access card.
2010-07-05T06:20:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	tarandus	when it happened i had to run to best buy and get an ethernet cable...
2010-07-05T06:20:00.000Z	tarandus	linux_is_my_hero	I do ;) will try your suggestion.
2010-07-05T06:23:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	tarandus	if you have anything already running ethernet, just use that cable temporarily so the situation doesnt get more complicated.
2010-07-05T06:24:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	tarandus	if not then u may have a bad etehrnet cable, or ethernet card, or wired switch may be malfunctioning
