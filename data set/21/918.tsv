2011-04-17T19:28:00.000Z	RealOp		suggestions on using another HDD as my HOME folder? :) plz thanks
2011-04-17T19:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RealOp	just use the same drive but a partition, using a whole drive as home isn't bad either and I suggest you move your swap space to the other drive to make it a little faster
2011-04-17T19:30:00.000Z	RealOp	ActionParsnip	kk its actually already setup that way. theres 3 partitions. 1 swap and two ext3
2011-04-17T19:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RealOp	cool
2011-04-17T19:31:00.000Z	RealOp	ActionParsnip	so if i move the swap part. to a diff drive this will help a bit aye?
2011-04-17T19:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RealOp	sure as both drives will be used when the swap is used rather than just one
2011-04-17T19:32:00.000Z	RealOp	ActionParsnip	I never really notice that my swap space is being used when i look in system mon.  so i should be okay with the way it is now yeah?
2011-04-17T19:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RealOp	should be ok. How much RAM do you have
2011-04-17T19:33:00.000Z	RealOp	ActionParsnip	3gb
2011-04-17T19:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RealOp	And what are the systems main uses?
2011-04-17T19:34:00.000Z	RealOp	ActionParsnip	ive delegated other task to different machines, so its mainly used to surf the web and as a file server
2011-04-17T19:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RealOp	you can add the line:     vm.swappiness = 0    to /etc/sysctl.conf    then run:  sudo sysctl -p    and swap will only be used if absolutely necessary
2011-04-17T19:37:00.000Z	RealOp	ActionParsnip	sweet thanks for the suggestion :)
2011-04-17T19:41:00.000Z	RealOp	ActionParsnip	so my drive is setup like this | primary ext3 partition that has the data | extended part. with ext4 OS and  swap |
2011-04-17T19:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RealOp	sounds fine
2011-04-17T19:43:00.000Z	RealOp	ActionParsnip	so suggestions on using my other partition as my home folder?
2011-04-17T19:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RealOp	it's still using FTP which is not very secure in any way
2011-04-17T19:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RealOp	if you want or need the space, sure why not
2011-04-17T19:44:00.000Z	RealOp	ActionParsnip	i have a general ideal of to mount the partition  and maybe a symbolic linke to the other drive???
2011-04-17T19:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RealOp	thats fine too
2011-05-04T00:50:00.000Z	RealOp	ActionParsnip	does alt cd support 64bit?
