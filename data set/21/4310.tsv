2012-06-27T16:16:00.000Z	hubert_		Anybody..?
2012-06-27T16:17:00.000Z	fidel	hubert_	anybody what?
2012-06-27T16:18:00.000Z	hubert_	fidel	I have problem with installing ubuntu on older laptop.. After loading screen a login screen shows up with boxes instead of characters.. Do you have any ideas..?
2012-06-27T16:18:00.000Z	fidel	hubert_	try to change the gfx driver or the login-manager ;)
2012-06-27T16:18:00.000Z	fidel		would be my first ideas
2012-06-27T16:19:00.000Z	hubert_	fidel	 It is not installed yet, it appears during installation..
2012-06-27T16:22:00.000Z	fidel	hubert_	so what login screen are we talking about then hubert_ ?
2012-06-27T16:22:00.000Z	fidel		are ...you
2012-06-27T16:22:00.000Z	fidel		*or* you
2012-06-27T16:23:00.000Z	hubert_		Well, i need to install it, so i put it in, restart PC, it loads, violet Ubuntu loading screen appears for a while and then appears login screen. Without anything installed.. fidel
2012-06-27T16:24:00.000Z	fidel	hubert_	doesnt makes sense
2012-06-27T16:24:00.000Z	fidel		if you insert an install cd - reboot your box - it will offer you to load from CD
2012-06-27T16:25:00.000Z	fidel		if you choose that it will again offer you either to install or use the live cd function
2012-06-27T16:25:00.000Z	fidel		in both cases there shouldnt be a login screen afaik
2012-06-27T16:25:00.000Z	hubert_		It doesnt. Just load and then login. Dunno why, that's why i ask..
2012-06-27T16:26:00.000Z	fidel		i guess we are talking about different topics then
2012-06-27T16:26:00.000Z	fidel		gl
2012-06-27T16:26:00.000Z	hubert_		gonna kill myself now..
2012-06-27T16:28:00.000Z	fidel	hubert_	2 final ideas or similar: are you using a current cd?
2012-06-27T16:29:00.000Z	fidel		and b) consider messing around with boot-parameter - most linux cd offer that option at start
2012-06-27T16:30:00.000Z	hubert_	fidel	im using 10.10. cd. but i will try 9.04 and try to upgrade it then..
