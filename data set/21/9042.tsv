2005-12-20T07:49:00.000Z	JoeyDay|wgu		Will Ubuntu boot up without a keyboard, mouse, and monitor?
2005-12-20T07:51:00.000Z	JoeyDay|wgu		I guess I should quit asking questions and explain the situation.
2005-12-20T07:52:00.000Z	JoeyDay|wgu		I installed Ubuntu on a computer while I was at work last night. I work in an IT Helpdesk and we have stations set up with monitor, keyboard and mouse and it makes it real easy to just hook up a tower and go to work.
2005-12-20T07:52:00.000Z	JoeyDay|wgu		Anyway, I got everything working so I could ssh into the box and then I shut it down and brought it home.
2005-12-20T07:52:00.000Z	JoeyDay|wgu		I don't have a monitor, keyboard, or mouse at home (I just use my laptop here), but I figured it should work to just plug it in and then ssh into it.
2005-12-20T07:53:00.000Z	JoeyDay|wgu		But it won't accept the connection now.
2005-12-20T07:53:00.000Z	JoeyDay|wgu		And when I hit the power button it just shuts straight down. Before, from within Ubuntu, it was doing a graceful shut down (>30 seconds) when I hit the power button.
2005-12-20T07:54:00.000Z	JoeyDay|wgu		So because it's powering down so quickly I'm assuming it's not getting past a certain point in the bootup.
2005-12-20T07:56:00.000Z	sethk	JoeyDay|wgu	in the same direction, newer machines have a BIOS option saying whether to halt on error
2005-12-20T07:56:00.000Z	JoeyDay|wgu		I guess I should've brought a monitor. That would've been the smart thing to do.
2005-12-20T07:56:00.000Z	sethk	JoeyDay|wgu	some have stop, stop except keyboard, and ignore all
2005-12-20T07:57:00.000Z	JoeyDay|wgu	The_Baker	I've got an nvidia card too. Riva TNT.
2005-12-20T07:57:00.000Z	JoeyDay|wgu	The_Baker	I wonder if that's the problem.
2005-12-20T08:00:00.000Z	JoeyDay|wgu		Aha, I hadn't plugged the keyboard into the right port...
2005-12-20T08:01:00.000Z	JoeyDay|wgu		I had plugged it in without looking at the back.
2005-12-20T08:01:00.000Z	JoeyDay|wgu		I guess that's what I get...
2005-12-20T08:01:00.000Z	JoeyDay|wgu		Trying to boot again, we'll see if it works this time.
2005-12-20T08:01:00.000Z	sethk	JoeyDay|wgu	dumb machine.  it should have known what you meant.
2005-12-20T08:01:00.000Z	JoeyDay|wgu		It still beeped.
2005-12-20T08:01:00.000Z	JoeyDay|wgu		Does it always beep, or does that indicate an error?
2005-12-20T08:02:00.000Z	sethk	JoeyDay|wgu	depends on the BIOS, most have a single beep
