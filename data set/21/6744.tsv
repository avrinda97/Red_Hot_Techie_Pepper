2007-02-05T14:00:00.000Z	train		this is a good oen
2007-02-05T14:01:00.000Z	train		one
2007-02-05T14:01:00.000Z	cables	train	i'm excited. The suspense is killing me :)
2007-02-05T14:01:00.000Z	cables	train	totem-mozilla is part of ubuntu-desktop.
2007-02-05T14:03:00.000Z	cables	train	you can remove ubuntu-desktop if you like. Just remember to re-install it when you upgrade to the latest Ubuntu version
2007-02-05T14:03:00.000Z	cables	train	removing ubuntu-desktop is the only way to remove totem-mozilla. I know, it kills me too :)
2007-02-05T14:04:00.000Z	cables	train	it isn't a piece of software in itself. It just exists for the purpose of installing the ubuntu desktop packages all at once, for instance if you're using Kubuntu and want to try the regular ubuntu desktop
2007-02-05T14:05:00.000Z	cables	train	i know... it feels sorta wrong, but it doesn't hurt anything to remove ubuntu-desktop
2007-02-05T14:05:00.000Z	cables	train	no it won't.
2007-02-05T14:06:00.000Z	cables	train	i will try to explain what ubuntu-desktop is
2007-02-05T14:07:00.000Z	cables	train	say you're using Kubuntu (a variant of Ubuntu with KDE instead of Gnome) and you want to try regular ubuntu. Installing the package ubuntu-desktop will install everything a regular Ubuntu install has. That's the only reason it exists.
2007-02-05T14:07:00.000Z	cables	train	don't reinstall ubuntu-desktop, because it'll just put totem-mozilla back
2007-02-05T14:08:00.000Z	cables	train	totem can play anything. I'll send you to a page to help you install the codecs. No need to remove anything.
2007-02-05T14:08:00.000Z	cables	train	good point.
2007-02-05T14:09:00.000Z	cables	train	mplayer plugin isn't the same as mplayer...
2007-02-05T14:10:00.000Z	cables	train	i use totem... it works fine.
2007-02-05T14:10:00.000Z	cables	train	if you want totem plugin to play restricted formats, here's a guide. Pretty simple, you just need to install a bunch of packages. It's a one-command fix.
2007-02-05T14:10:00.000Z	cables	train	if "normal" formats
2007-02-05T14:11:00.000Z	cables	train	sorry, pasted the wrong thing
2007-02-05T14:19:00.000Z	train	cables	I hate to sound like a retard but what exactly is uninstalled when I remove package ubunu-desktop
