2006-01-15T10:56:00.000Z	student		Does anyone know what this is?
2006-01-15T10:58:00.000Z	student		I think ubuntu is not created enough space in the tmpfs during installation.  How can I increase it?
2006-01-15T11:00:00.000Z	student		what is an LVM volume and do I need it?
2006-01-15T11:01:00.000Z	soundray	student	LVM = logical volume management.
2006-01-15T11:01:00.000Z	student	soundray	how do I know if I should select this option during installation?
2006-01-15T11:01:00.000Z	soundray	student	if you're unsure, don't do it.
2006-01-15T11:02:00.000Z	soundray	student	the default works well enough, and if one day you find that you need LVM, e.g. for accessing multiple hd's as one large pseudo-partition, you can still read up on it and add it on.
2006-01-15T11:03:00.000Z	student	soundray	 it requires 400MB, but I see my tmpfs does not have that much available.  Is there a way to increase the size of the tmpfs during installation?  Or is there a way to workaround this issue?  Thanks.
2006-01-15T11:03:00.000Z	soundray	student	not sure - haven't heard of such a problem before.
2006-01-15T11:03:00.000Z	soundray	student	how much RAM do you have?
2006-01-15T11:04:00.000Z	soundray	student	yes.
2006-01-15T11:04:00.000Z	student	soundray	well, it requires 400MB, but I do a df command and see that I have only 70MB allocated on tmpfs.
2006-01-15T11:04:00.000Z	student	soundray	 memtotal = 192016 kB
2006-01-15T11:05:00.000Z	soundray	student	I don't think this is a tmpfs issue.
2006-01-15T11:06:00.000Z	student	soundray	 well where else would the installation copy the packages to?
2006-01-15T11:06:00.000Z	soundray	student	to your root partition.
2006-01-15T11:06:00.000Z	student	soundray	during installation the root partition has not been created as far as I can tell
2006-01-15T11:07:00.000Z	soundray	student	it must have, it wouldn't be copying packages otherwise. Sorry student, have to go. I'll check if you're still around in half an hour.

2006-01-15T13:59:00.000Z	soundray	student	glad you got this far. Set up an additional user if you need a non-privileged one.
