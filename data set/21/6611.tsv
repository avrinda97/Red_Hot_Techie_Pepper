2007-04-03T09:55:00.000Z	Cin		libGL warning: 3D driver claims to not support visual 0x5b
2007-04-03T09:55:00.000Z	Cin		direct rendering: Yes
2007-04-03T09:56:00.000Z	crdlb	Cin	that warning is completely harmless
2007-04-03T09:57:00.000Z	Cin	crdlb	I wish it did. because nobody has an explanation as to why my card is slow
2007-04-03T10:00:00.000Z	crdlb	Cin	you /should/ be using the "i810" driver
2007-04-03T10:01:00.000Z	Cin	crdlb	which I am
2007-04-03T10:01:00.000Z	Cin	crdlb	just poorly?
2007-04-03T10:01:00.000Z	crdlb	Cin	this is the first time I've heard a complaint about intel's linux drivers
2007-04-03T10:02:00.000Z	Cin	crdlb	then I don't suppose you browse the Ubuntu forum much
2007-04-03T10:02:00.000Z	crdlb	Cin	not at all :D
2007-04-03T10:23:00.000Z	crdlb	Cin	you should be running the "generic" kernel not "386"
2007-04-03T10:23:00.000Z	Cin	crdlb	well that's what `uname -r` gives me
2007-04-03T10:23:00.000Z	crdlb	Cin	yes, you should remove linux-image-386, and and switch at grub
2007-04-03T10:24:00.000Z	Cin	crdlb	but that's the default one. what should I select instead/
2007-04-03T10:24:00.000Z	crdlb	Cin	on edgy you should use "generic"
2007-04-03T10:28:00.000Z	crdlb	Cin	then install linux-image-generic
2007-04-03T10:29:00.000Z	Cin	crdlb	what will this afford me?
2007-04-03T10:37:00.000Z	crdlb	Cin	generic works better
2007-04-03T10:38:00.000Z	Cin	crdlb	what parts work better?
2007-04-03T10:39:00.000Z	crdlb	Cin	386 is designed specifically for the 386 (nothing newer), generic is designed to work well on nearly all processors
2007-04-03T10:40:00.000Z	Cin	crdlb	I can see how that helps my problem of installing kernel headers. thanks
