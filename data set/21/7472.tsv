2012-09-26T11:24:00.000Z	write	lotuspsychje	it is just for dual screens ? :-s ... then its not what i need
2012-09-26T11:30:00.000Z	write	lotuspsychje	naaah :) just this time, to see if i'm mistaking about the 768 res in win, or win also has just 1024x600
2012-09-26T11:30:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	write	you can try ##hardware too for excact info about your res hardware
2012-09-26T11:32:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	write	and whats the purpose exactly you want this specific res?
2012-09-26T11:32:00.000Z	write	lotuspsychje	my screen is wide... and with 600, it looks odd...
2012-09-26T11:34:00.000Z	write	lotuspsychje	i thought that this tutorial is what i need :)
2012-09-26T11:35:00.000Z	write	lotuspsychje	in the sample i get like: Screen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1024 x 600, maximum 1800x1800
2012-09-26T11:35:00.000Z	write	lotuspsychje	so shouldn;t it be able to go higher than 600... and i remember that on windows it did, but to be sure i have to reinstall it one more time and then get back to ubuntu :D
2012-09-26T11:37:00.000Z	write	lotuspsychje	 not right now, i have to get home from work in about 5 hours or so, i dont have the netbook with me.
2012-09-26T11:43:00.000Z	write	lotuspsychje	will you be online in like 5 hours or so ?
2012-09-26T11:44:00.000Z	write	lotuspsychje	oke, thank you... i'll check on windows what we talked here and get back to ubuntu
2012-09-26T11:46:00.000Z	write	lotuspsychje	i wanna be sure, and take a screenshot even, that windows sets the resolution to 1024x768 ... if that's the case, ubuntu has to be able to do that so .. (as far as i can remember, windows did that, but not really sure), so i have to make this "experiment"
2012-09-26T11:46:00.000Z	write	lotuspsychje	oke, ty
2012-09-26T12:03:00.000Z	write	lotuspsychje	=)) wow, sry
