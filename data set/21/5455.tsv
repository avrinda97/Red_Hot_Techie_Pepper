2007-12-28T04:47:00.000Z	vishal		Hi, sorry this is a really dumb question, but how do I increase the number of desktop workspaces?
2007-12-28T04:48:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	vishal	Are you using compiz?
2007-12-28T04:48:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	vishal	Do you have ccsm installed?
2007-12-28T04:49:00.000Z	vishal	Odd-rationale	I think so, it that just the setting page?
2007-12-28T04:50:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	vishal	Click on general settings
2007-12-28T04:50:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	vishal	Then go to the desktop size tab.
2007-12-28T04:51:00.000Z	vishal	Odd-rationale	bahh i missed it lol, wasnt expecting it to have sliders
2007-12-28T04:51:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	vishal	This is the confusion part. If you want to have a cube set H to 4, V to 1 and #D to 1.
2007-12-28T04:51:00.000Z	vishal	Odd-rationale	this is weried, i have 4 hor, 1 vert but only 1 vertical desktop
2007-12-28T04:51:00.000Z	vishal	Odd-rationale	the cube is no longer enough for me lol
2007-12-28T04:52:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	vishal	It works best to keep the V and # desk to 1
2007-12-28T04:52:00.000Z	vishal	Odd-rationale	yeah just tired increasing those but made no difference to the cude
2007-12-28T04:52:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	vishal	You can change the H to up to 32.
2007-12-28T04:53:00.000Z	vishal	Odd-rationale	awesome, anyway of putting a desktop as lids?
2007-12-28T04:53:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	vishal	Nope. You can put cube cpas though.
2007-12-28T04:54:00.000Z	vishal	Odd-rationale	Hmm, would have been nice to have the desktops there instead of a colour/image
2007-12-28T04:54:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	vishal	Sorry :(
2007-12-28T04:55:00.000Z	vishal	Odd-rationale	No worries, thanks for the help though
2007-12-28T04:55:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	vishal	OK np
2007-12-28T05:09:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	vishal	Try man devilspie
2007-12-28T05:10:00.000Z	vishal	Odd-rationale	bruenig: Cool thanks for the help
