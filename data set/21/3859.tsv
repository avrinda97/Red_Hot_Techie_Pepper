2009-02-01T21:56:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n		hi there I am looking for some graphic editor tool apart from gimp and inkscape
2009-02-01T21:58:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n		I am looking for something like gimp
2009-02-01T21:59:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n		the problem with gimp is that shapes can be drawn and managed easily
2009-02-01T22:01:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n		qcad let me try
2009-02-01T22:01:00.000Z	storbeck	silv3r_m00n	Why don't you just look in Synaptic under the Graphics tab?
2009-02-01T21:56:00.000Z	storbeck	silv3r_m00n	photoshop
2009-02-01T21:57:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	storbeck	is there a linux version ?
2009-02-01T21:57:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	storbeck	something that is available for linux
2009-03-01T21:06:00.000Z	storbeck	silv3r_m00n	dev files don't need lib
2009-03-01T21:06:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	storbeck	then against what will an c program be build ?
2009-03-01T21:07:00.000Z	storbeck	silv3r_m00n	c programs only need header files
2009-03-01T21:07:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	storbeck	strange... you mean no need of function implementation ... only the names ?
2009-03-01T21:08:00.000Z	storbeck	silv3r_m00n	The functions are implemented in the header files
2009-03-01T21:08:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	storbeck	sure ? I thought that header files only have the protoypes
2009-03-01T21:09:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	storbeck	by the way what are these .a and .la files ?
2009-03-01T21:10:00.000Z	storbeck	silv3r_m00n	.a is a unix static object code library, la is a gnu libtol library file
2009-03-01T21:11:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	storbeck	so .a files shud have the pseudo code , .so files the real function implementation and .h files the prototype ?
2009-03-01T21:12:00.000Z	storbeck	silv3r_m00n	What is the actual issue?
2009-03-01T21:12:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	storbeck	just trying to understand what has what
2009-03-01T21:13:00.000Z	storbeck	silv3r_m00n	You may want to join ##c if it's not an ubuntu related issue
2009-03-01T21:13:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	storbeck	the topic is linux related
