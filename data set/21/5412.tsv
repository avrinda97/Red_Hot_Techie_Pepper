2008-01-09T03:11:00.000Z	Omnimon-X		Does anyone know how to kill X server display without restarting my comp? I have an irc server running on this comp and I don't want to kill it...
2008-01-09T03:11:00.000Z	Omnimon-X		It locked up, lol
2008-01-09T03:11:00.000Z	macd	Omnimon-X	crtl+alt+backspace restarts it, to kill it use sudo /etc/init.d/xorg stop
2008-01-09T03:12:00.000Z	macd	Omnimon-X	yeah my mistake its x11-common ;P
2008-01-09T03:13:00.000Z	Omnimon-X	macd	it didn't work
2008-01-09T03:13:00.000Z	macd	Omnimon-X	stop gdm also then
2008-01-09T03:16:00.000Z	Omnimon-X	macd	still locked up
2008-01-09T03:16:00.000Z	macd	Omnimon-X	does ps ax | grep X in console list any processes?
2008-01-09T03:17:00.000Z	Omnimon-X	macd	it lists tty2 and thats it
2008-01-09T03:17:00.000Z	macd	Omnimon-X	you see that number in front of tty2, well issue command "sudo kill -9 number"
2008-01-09T03:18:00.000Z	Omnimon-X	macd	it says no such process
2008-01-09T03:19:00.000Z	Omnimon-X	macd	I entered the command again and the number is different
2008-01-09T03:19:00.000Z	macd	Omnimon-X	if the number in front of tty2 was 1234 you issued sudo kill -9 1234 right?
2008-01-09T03:19:00.000Z	macd	Omnimon-X	  ohh, interesting, different number
2008-01-09T03:20:00.000Z	macd	Omnimon-X	that makes sense, did you issue both "sudo /etc/init.d/x11-common stop" and "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop"
2008-01-09T03:21:00.000Z	Omnimon-X	macd	now what? keyboard is still locked up on the screen where the display usually is, and there is a black screen
2008-01-09T03:22:00.000Z	macd	Omnimon-X	well reverse the stop with start now on those 2 commands, and hopefully X will come back up with a login prompt
2008-01-09T03:23:00.000Z	Omnimon-X	macd	now the numlock is blinking on the screen
2008-01-09T03:23:00.000Z	macd	Omnimon-X	Im fresh out of ideas then to be honest, better warn your users reboot iminenet ;P
2008-01-09T03:24:00.000Z	macd	Omnimon-X	but dont give up, someone else here is sure to have another idea, maybe Jack_Sparrow  ;)
2008-01-09T03:27:00.000Z	Omnimon-X	macd	I tried to remote desktop to my computer, but got an error, lol
