2011-04-28T20:06:00.000Z	Roasted_		Is there an official download of 11.04 2d?
2011-04-28T20:06:00.000Z	arand	Roasted_	2d?
2011-04-28T20:07:00.000Z	Roasted_	arand	unity 2d
2011-04-28T20:07:00.000Z	Roasted_	arand	I installed ubuntu on my cr-48 and its running kind of sluggish
2011-04-28T20:07:00.000Z	arand	Roasted_	It can be installed, but is not default in any release no.
2011-04-28T20:07:00.000Z	arand	Roasted_	apt-get install unity-2d
2011-04-28T20:07:00.000Z	arand	Roasted_	And select it at login
2011-04-28T20:08:00.000Z	Roasted_	arand	so that'll allow me to have 3d and 2d available?
2011-04-28T20:08:00.000Z	arand	Roasted_	Yes, choose at login.
2011-05-19T21:03:00.000Z	arand	Roasted_	The iso, possibly, not the installed system though, check with !md5sum
2011-05-19T21:04:00.000Z	Roasted_	arand	it just seemed small to me
2011-05-19T21:04:00.000Z	Roasted_	arand	and I cant find the md5's on the ubuntu site to compare
2011-05-19T21:04:00.000Z	Roasted_	arand	I know.
2011-05-19T21:04:00.000Z	Roasted_	arand	but I can't find them on the UBUNTU SITE to compare them.
2011-05-19T21:05:00.000Z	arand	Roasted_	The links I gave you tells you where they can be found
2011-05-19T21:06:00.000Z	Roasted_	arand	we're not on the same page.
2011-05-19T21:06:00.000Z	Roasted_	arand	I know how to find the md5 sum. But I cannot find the md5 on the site prior to downloading.
2011-05-19T21:06:00.000Z	arand	Roasted_	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM
2011-05-19T21:06:00.000Z	Roasted_	arand	the purpose of md5 is to compare. You compare it to what it should be versus what you have. I know how to get what I have when it's downloaded. But I cannot find the md5 posted on the ubuntu site for that comparison to take place.
2011-05-19T21:07:00.000Z	Roasted_	arand	please read what I'm saying...
2011-05-19T21:09:00.000Z	arand	Roasted_	No worries :)
