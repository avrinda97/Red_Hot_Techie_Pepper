2008-09-03T06:27:00.000Z	Devourer		I can't install the libdbus-1-dev package on Hardy. Why?
2008-09-03T06:27:00.000Z	jrib	Devourer	pastebin what happens when you try
2008-09-03T06:28:00.000Z	Devourer	jrib	http://pastebin.ca/1192133
2008-09-03T06:30:00.000Z	Devourer	jrib	do you know what it means?
2008-09-03T06:30:00.000Z	jrib	Devourer	sudo apt-get update, try again.  If it still fails, pastebin the output of 'apt-cache policy libdbus-1-dev libdbus-1-3' and your /etc/apt/sources.list
2008-09-03T06:30:00.000Z	Devourer	jrib	alright.
2008-09-03T06:34:00.000Z	Devourer	jrib	http://pastebin.ca/1192139
2008-09-03T06:47:00.000Z	Devourer	jrib	is it baffling you?
2008-09-03T06:47:00.000Z	jrib	Devourer	missed your paste, one sec
2008-09-03T06:47:00.000Z	Devourer	jrib	oh.
2008-09-03T06:47:00.000Z	Devourer	jrib	thought you were working really hard on it. Lol.
2008-09-03T06:49:00.000Z	jrib	Devourer	you have #1.1.20-1ubuntu2 however that is not from a repository you currently have enabled
2008-09-03T06:50:00.000Z	Devourer	jrib	oh... what repo do I need to enable?
2008-09-03T06:50:00.000Z	jrib	Devourer	you probably had -updates enabled at some point and then removed them.  Enable -updates again.  I'd recommend -security as well
2008-09-03T06:51:00.000Z	Devourer	jrib	what do you mean enable? Just sudo apt-get update?
2008-09-03T06:51:00.000Z	jrib	Devourer	nah, go to system -> administration -> software sources
2008-09-03T06:52:00.000Z	Devourer	jrib	uhhh... I'm on using KDE... >.> :o
2008-09-03T06:52:00.000Z	Devourer	jrib	nvm.
2008-09-03T06:52:00.000Z	Devourer	jrib	it's all good.
2008-09-03T06:54:00.000Z	Devourer	jrib	I was kind of curious why I wasn't getting updates like on my other computer... I wonder why they got turned off.
2008-09-03T07:00:00.000Z	Devourer	jrib	it works now... Thank you. =]
