2007-10-05T15:18:00.000Z	GigaClon		/boot/grub/menu.lst seems to be fine but it just can't mount my Ubuntu partitions
2007-10-05T15:19:00.000Z	_Andrew	GigaClon	maybe you need to edit your boot line from hd1,1 to hd0,1 or something like that?
2007-10-05T15:20:00.000Z	GigaClon	_Andrew	it seem to be in order everything is hd0,*
2007-10-05T15:21:00.000Z	_Andrew	GigaClon	Whats the error message? No partition found or something like that?
2007-10-05T15:22:00.000Z	_Andrew	GigaClon	Can you give me your boot line please
2007-10-05T15:22:00.000Z	GigaClon	_Andrew	which is that i have menu.lst open
2007-10-05T15:24:00.000Z	_Andrew	GigaClon	For example mine says.. root  (hd0,0)
2007-10-05T15:25:00.000Z	GigaClon	_Andrew	when i did find /boot/grub/stage1 i got root(hd0,1) but menu.lst only has root(hd0,1) linux and root(hd0,0) windows
2007-10-05T15:26:00.000Z	_Andrew	GigaClon	Did you move your hard discs around or something like that?
2007-10-05T15:27:00.000Z	GigaClon	_Andrew	no its a laptop, only one disk
2007-10-05T15:28:00.000Z	_Andrew	GigaClon	ok, thats weird.. Did you do fixmbr in the windows recovery console? Did you say your reinstalled grub right?
2007-10-05T15:29:00.000Z	GigaClon	_Andrew	didn't use fixmbr
2007-10-05T15:30:00.000Z	_Andrew	GigaClon	Just so I can completely understand your situation.. it just stopped working or..?
2007-10-05T15:31:00.000Z	GigaClon	_Andrew	Windows got bad, so i reinstalled a clean copy, following the Recovering GRUB wiki page, gave me the grub menu back again but I can't boot into Ubuntu, it said the partition can't be mounted
2007-10-05T15:32:00.000Z	_Andrew	GigaClon	Ok, right. Do you have a line in your menu.lst that says... kernel  /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.20-16-generic root= blah blah blah....
2007-10-05T15:33:00.000Z	_Andrew	GigaClon	 ... and does it have.. UUID= ... followed by numbers and letters?
2007-10-05T15:34:00.000Z	GigaClon	_Andrew	its the correct UUID for the device
2007-10-05T15:37:00.000Z	_Andrew	GigaClon	I found a thread on the forums which is like your situation.. They suggest you boot up the live CD and run "sudo fdisk -l" get the new UUID and edit your menu.lst... here's the thread... http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=477169
2007-10-05T15:37:00.000Z	GigaClon	_Andrew	when i did "sudo grub" and tab complete root(hd0, it gives me 4 entrys
2007-10-05T15:46:00.000Z	GigaClon	_Andrew	it works all I had to do is change, root(hd0,2) to root(hd0,1)
2007-10-05T15:46:00.000Z	_Andrew	GigaClon	Ah! I knew it would be a numbers game
