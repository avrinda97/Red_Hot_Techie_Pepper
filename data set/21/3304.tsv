2009-01-31T23:09:00.000Z	bastones		Hi...just migrated from Ubuntu and finally got wireless working....the only problem Ihave now is that the keyboard sometimes misses out characters as I type such as 'hllo' etc ... I have Ubuntu on a separate partition and I dont have such problems in Windows...? Laptop is ADVENT 5611
2009-01-31T23:10:00.000Z	f4nt	bastones	Does this behavior only occur when typing relatively fast, or can you reproduce it with certain keys? Note: Not blaming you for typos, I have a similar issue, and it's not a typo related problem. :)
2009-01-31T23:11:00.000Z	bastones		Hi f4nt... I'm not entirely sure... but even when creating new tab in FF (CTRL + F) seems to not work once or twice... but it may be related to typing too fast for it to recognise what I type...not sure
2009-01-31T23:12:00.000Z	f4nt	bastones	Ever try with an external keyboard by chance?
2009-01-31T23:13:00.000Z	f4nt	bastones	I've determined that my Acer's keyboard is just utter crap personally. If I start wailing away on it, keystrokes get missed, but a decent keyboard externally never reproduces the issue.
2009-01-31T23:14:00.000Z	bastones	f4nt	yes but I have no such problems I have in Ubuntu in Windows ... is there some settings that need to be changed or?
2009-01-31T23:15:00.000Z	f4nt	bastones	I'll do some searching, see what I can find.
2009-01-31T23:15:00.000Z	bastones		thank you
2009-01-31T23:16:00.000Z	f4nt	bastones	this doesn't occur after hibernation or anything right? Just always happens?
2009-01-31T23:17:00.000Z	bastones		yes always happens .. no set time ... I'#ve even tried rebooting but problem still occurs
2009-01-31T23:17:00.000Z	f4nt	bastones	thx
2009-01-31T23:22:00.000Z	f4nt	bastones	other than finding other people with the same problem I haven't had any real luck.
2009-01-31T23:22:00.000Z	bastones		do you think a reinstall would do any good?
2009-01-31T23:23:00.000Z	f4nt	bastones	I've gone through a variety of reinstallations for unrelated reasons.. No luck on my end so far.
2009-01-31T23:23:00.000Z	f4nt	bastones	I would assume there's some form of sensitivity to be adjusted but I'm not sure where/what. I always chalked it up to a crappy buffer on the laptop keyboard.
2009-01-31T23:23:00.000Z	bastones		hmm ... I'm not sure if its a compatibility problem with Ubuntu ...
2009-01-31T23:24:00.000Z	bastones		this laptop is quite new so I dont think its a problem with my keyboard...
2009-01-31T23:25:00.000Z	bastones		I thought at first it was because of background programs or something
2009-01-31T23:25:00.000Z	f4nt	bastones	Did you try messing with your keyboard preferences btw?
2009-01-31T23:25:00.000Z	bastones		no not when it first started
2009-01-31T23:27:00.000Z	f4nt	bastones	On a limb you could probably adjust the accessibility options of the keyboard presses to hack things to a working state. I know that's hardly a "solution" though. Sorry I couldn't be of more help.
