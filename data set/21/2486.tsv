2009-12-20T05:32:00.000Z	ries		Is there a way to permanently remove scrollkeeper from a ubuntu installation? it keeps consuming anywhere between 80-100% CPU :O
2009-12-20T05:34:00.000Z	ries		and in fact... it doesn't let apt-get to do it's work....
2009-12-20T05:34:00.000Z	ChogyDan	ries	how long?  it should finish at some point
2009-12-20T05:34:00.000Z	ries		it stalls with scrollkeeper-up at 80-100% CPU
2009-12-20T05:34:00.000Z	ries	ChogyDan	minutes... hours.... last time I tried to keep it there it took hours and never finnished...
2009-12-20T05:34:00.000Z	ChogyDan	ries	what ubuntu are you running?
2009-12-20T05:35:00.000Z	ries	ChogyDan	I don't know what it's doing... but it seems to do a bad job ( I am not the only one according to google...)
2009-12-20T05:35:00.000Z	ries	ChogyDan	8.04
2009-12-20T05:35:00.000Z	ChogyDan	ries	well, I think it was depreciated in like 8.10
2009-12-20T05:35:00.000Z	ries	ChogyDan	I cannot upgrade though, but I will see how I can disable it
2009-12-20T05:36:00.000Z	ChogyDan	ries	you could always just kill the process
2009-12-20T05:36:00.000Z	ries	ChogyDan	when I do, then apt-get bails out with errors
2009-12-20T05:37:00.000Z	ChogyDan	ries	can you pastebin that?  along with the commands you are running
2009-12-20T05:38:00.000Z	ries	ChogyDan	yeaa I think I can... hang on
2009-12-20T05:40:00.000Z	ries	ChogyDan	there we go : http://pastebin.org/66787
2009-12-20T05:42:00.000Z	ChogyDan	ries	well, there is something wrong with gnome-system-tools,   maybe try sudo apt-get install --reinstall gnome-system-tools -f
2009-12-20T05:43:00.000Z	ries	ChogyDan	let me try that
2009-12-20T05:50:00.000Z	ries	ChogyDan	I followed the tip here : https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/scrollkeeper/+bug/164819/comments/6
2009-12-20T05:50:00.000Z	ries		it's hackisch, but it sems to work...
2009-12-20T05:51:00.000Z	ChogyDan	ries	does it fix your apt-get problem?
2009-12-20T05:54:00.000Z	ries	ChogyDan	yes it does :)
