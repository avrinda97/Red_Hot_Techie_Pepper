2010-05-28T19:01:00.000Z	phillyj		can someone tell me how to set the PATH? sipior told me something like "export PATH=$:/directory"; Is this correct?
2010-05-28T19:01:00.000Z	phillyj		i mean "export PATH=$PATH:/directory"
2010-05-28T19:01:00.000Z	blendmaster1024	phillyj	from the command line already i assume?
2010-05-28T19:01:00.000Z	phillyj	blendmaster1024	yes
2010-05-28T19:02:00.000Z	blendmaster1024	phillyj	then yes, that will do it for one session. do you want it for just one session, or for forever?
2010-05-28T19:02:00.000Z	phillyj	blendmaster1024	oh, i need to permanently change it
2010-05-28T19:03:00.000Z	blendmaster1024	phillyj	i see. hold on a sec ...
2010-05-28T19:05:00.000Z	blendmaster1024	phillyj	ok, open your ~/.bashrc and add at the end the 'export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/directory"'
2010-05-28T19:06:00.000Z	phillyj	blendmaster1024	what is ~/.bashrc and where is it?
2010-05-28T19:07:00.000Z	blendmaster1024	phillyj	~/ is a shortcut to your home directory, so ~/.bashrc is a text file in your home directory that starts with a . aka it's hidden.
2010-05-28T19:08:00.000Z	phillyj	blendmaster1024	i get permission denied when i type ~/.bashrc
2010-05-28T19:09:00.000Z	blendmaster1024	phillyj	ok. just run this command and the text editor will open: 'gedit ~/.bashrc'
2010-05-28T19:12:00.000Z	phillyj	blendmaster1024	so i just add the export to the end? I have another location that i must also add to the PATH so would I write another "export" line?
2010-05-28T19:13:00.000Z	blendmaster1024	phillyj	yep, at the end. no, you'd put both in the same line: "export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/directory1:/directory2/path/here"
2010-05-28T19:16:00.000Z	phillyj	blendmaster1024	is there a space between the  1st and 2nd directories?
2010-05-28T19:17:00.000Z	blendmaster1024	phillyj	no. a space will break it.
2010-05-28T19:17:00.000Z	blendmaster1024	phillyj	in fact, if you have spaces in any of the names of the directorys, the export line has to be slightly different.
2010-05-28T19:26:00.000Z	phillyj	blendmaster1024	i think i have to reboot for the PATH changes to take place?
2010-05-28T19:27:00.000Z	blendmaster1024	phillyj	no. just restart bash.
2010-05-28T19:27:00.000Z	phillyj	blendmaster1024	how do i restart bash?
2010-05-28T19:27:00.000Z	blendmaster1024	phillyj	close the terminal, reopen.
