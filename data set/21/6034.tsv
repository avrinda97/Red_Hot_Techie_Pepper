2008-06-15T13:35:00.000Z	wers	minimec	I'm just not sure if my logitech quickcam orbit is uvc. I'll just try it. thanks
2008-06-15T13:35:00.000Z	minimec	wers	Yes it is. I have a Logitech webcam sphere, which is the european version of the orbit ;)
2008-06-15T13:36:00.000Z	wers	minimec	wow. I'm lucky. I'll download that :)
2008-06-15T13:44:00.000Z	wers	minimec	doesn't work for me :( I'll show it on pastebin. wait

2008-06-15T13:47:00.000Z	minimec	wers	JUst a moment please
2008-06-15T13:49:00.000Z	minimec	wers	can you give your output of lsusb (look for Logitech)

2008-06-15T13:50:00.000Z	wers	minimec	works for other apps like vlc
2008-06-15T13:52:00.000Z	minimec	wers	I know that there were different versions of the sphere/orbit. The earlier versions had some problems with the linux-uvc driver.
2008-06-15T13:53:00.000Z	minimec	wers	I have to 'search' the web for that. give me some time... ;)
2008-06-15T13:53:00.000Z	wers	minimec	is there any other app that can record? okay. hehe
2008-06-15T14:00:00.000Z	minimec	wers	Ok I got something for you. Your cam is not an UVC cam, but a Philips PWC. http://www.quickcamteam.net/hcl/linux/logitech-webcams
2008-06-15T14:01:00.000Z	wers	minimec	ooh yeah. there are to sphere versions. mine is the older one
2008-06-15T14:03:00.000Z	minimec	wers	Mine seems to be a newer version, but not the newest. Had some problems with uvc in gutsy, but uvc and hardy rocks. guvcview will not work with your cam.
2008-06-15T14:04:00.000Z	wers	minimec	yeah. yours is the version that has the cool app in windows (puts images on top of the user's face). hehe
2008-06-15T14:06:00.000Z	minimec	wers	Yeah, but I never tried that software, because I have no win-box anymore ;)
2008-06-15T14:07:00.000Z	wers	minimec	I love webcams better on Ubuntu (if they work) because you can adjust the framerate, white balance, etc
2008-06-15T14:10:00.000Z	wers	minimec	I'm recording now with wxcam but it doesnt record audio with the video :( damn. I guess, I'll just use my real video cam. hehe
