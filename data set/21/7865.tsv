2007-08-29T08:09:00.000Z	Carroarmato0		bot attack?
2007-08-29T08:11:00.000Z	Carroarmato0		I have a question: I'm using Vmware on Ubuntu... by killing connectivity on the host.. does the guest on Vmware still have connectivity?
2007-08-29T08:12:00.000Z	taxman	Carroarmato0	how are you killing the host's conectivity?
2007-08-29T08:12:00.000Z	Carroarmato0	taxman	I'm planning to do a " sudo ifdown && sudo ifup "
2007-08-29T08:13:00.000Z	taxman	Carroarmato0	I can try it in a little while if you want a test :)
2007-08-29T08:14:00.000Z	Carroarmato0	taxman	yeah thx that would be great... I'm downloading updates in Ubuntu Gutsy Tribe 5.. so I don't want to interopt that ^^
2007-08-29T08:15:00.000Z	Carroarmato0	taxman	good luk
2007-08-29T08:15:00.000Z	taxman	Carroarmato0	good idea, I wanted to grab that too :)
2007-08-29T08:17:00.000Z	Carroarmato0	taxman	it's just that I don't want to kill my connection on VMWare where I'm updating Gutsy... but I also want to update network manager manually on my host... which involves killing the connection and reopening it... hate to restart the update of Gusty cuz I've got a really slow connection right now... don't want to respend 2 hours for it... ^^'
2007-08-29T08:18:00.000Z	taxman	Carroarmato0	I have a strong feeling it won't work, but I'll try it. I'll have to leave and come back here I'm sure
2007-08-29T08:18:00.000Z	Carroarmato0	taxman	ok thx!
2007-08-29T08:19:00.000Z	Carroarmato0	taxman	doesn't vmware use it's own network device? Or are they linked to my hosts one?
2007-08-29T08:23:00.000Z	taxman	Carroarmato0	on a Windows vm, the gutsy tr5 iso just paused while the network was down and then continued when it came back
2007-08-29T08:25:00.000Z	Carroarmato0	taxman	hmm... but will it be the same with me?  My host is Ubuntu... I checked ifconfig and it showed that the vmware devices have their own ip that is different from my host's eth0
2007-08-29T08:28:00.000Z	taxman	Carroarmato0	yes, Feisty is my host too. My Ip
2007-08-29T08:28:00.000Z	taxman	Carroarmato0	my ip's are different too
2007-08-29T08:29:00.000Z	Carroarmato0	taxman	Gutsy just finished it's update... so I can disconnect safely now.. thx for the help though! ^^
2007-08-29T08:30:00.000Z	taxman	Carroarmato0	heh, no problem
2007-08-29T08:30:00.000Z	taxman	Carroarmato0	chicken :)
2007-08-29T08:30:00.000Z	Carroarmato0	taxman	:P
