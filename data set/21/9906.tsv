2005-06-20T07:04:00.000Z	Echo_Mage		Anyone know the system requirements for Ubuntu?
2005-06-20T07:05:00.000Z	Echo_Mage		Nothing else matters then?
2005-06-20T07:05:00.000Z	Echo_Mage		Memory and processor speed are my main concern?
2005-06-20T07:06:00.000Z	Echo_Mage		got a P3 500 with 64MB RAM, think it will run ok?

2005-06-20T07:07:00.000Z	xero	Echo_Mage	i have a celeron 533 w/ 64mbs in it and it installs fine... i ran gnome and it was QUITE sluggish.  but it does work
2005-06-20T07:09:00.000Z	xero	Echo_Mage	if you were to look for a more lightweight display manager that would b a good idea or just use it as a server
2005-06-20T07:09:00.000Z	xero	Echo_Mage	KDE is even more fatt
2005-06-20T07:11:00.000Z	xero	Echo_Mage	just remember a livecd is always gonna be slow as heck b/c its a cd
2005-06-20T07:22:00.000Z	xero	Echo_Mage	yeah but u can install more if you want to
2005-06-20T08:22:00.000Z	Echo_Mage	xero	 if Ubuntu proves to be as good as I hope it is, It will replace Mepis
2005-06-20T08:23:00.000Z	xero	Echo_Mage	i dont mnow much of Mepis... is it a new distro or just a livecd?
2005-06-20T08:24:00.000Z	Echo_Mage	xero	apparently a new distro, linux.org doesn't even have it listed yet
