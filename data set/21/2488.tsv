2009-10-02T19:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	dpac	then it is impossible that firefox upgraded to 3.5.4pre by itself
2009-10-02T19:29:00.000Z	dpac	erUSUL	well, I have added a couple of repositories, maybe they did it. I mean I updated and it updated the firefox to 3.5.4pre.
2009-10-02T19:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	dpac	what "couple of repositories" you added?

2009-10-19T23:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	dpac	Aplicactions>Accesories>Disk use analizer is a graphical up. very nice to spot this kind of things
2009-10-21T20:43:00.000Z	dpac	erUSUL	hey

2009-10-21T20:45:00.000Z	dpac	erUSUL	My HDD space was disappearing. Well, I couldn't figure out and yeah, a restart did bring the space back. But today 1.5GB is gone. I certainly can't keep losing space like that.
