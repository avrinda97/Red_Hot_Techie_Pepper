2008-10-12T19:00:00.000Z	andresmh		where do I find out what version of ALSA driver i have?
2008-10-12T19:00:00.000Z	andresmh		my mic is not working on my thinkpad x300
2008-10-12T19:02:00.000Z	andresmh		how do I find out what sound card I have?
2008-10-12T19:02:00.000Z	dulakian	andresmh	lspci should show it
2008-10-12T19:06:00.000Z	dulakian	andresmh	did you use the mixer to turn on the mic input?  I think by default alsa mutes everything
2008-10-12T19:08:00.000Z	andresmh	dulakian	amanu: thanks. i found the sound controller. i went over each one of the devices and made sure they were not mute.
2008-10-12T19:11:00.000Z	dulakian	andresmh	open a terminal and run alsamixer, use the arrow keys to go to the right until you see the mic listed, is that at 0?
2008-10-12T19:12:00.000Z	andresmh	dulakian	pressing the left and right arrow key doesn't seem to change anything. I keep seeing <Master> at the bottom.
2008-10-12T19:12:00.000Z	dulakian	andresmh	use tab to switch screens then
2008-10-12T19:13:00.000Z	andresmh	dulakian	ah, now I see <capture>
2008-10-12T19:14:00.000Z	dulakian	andresmh	yeah not sure why your arrows aren't working, the mic is off the screen to the right, and the one you want is listed on playback, not capture.  that doesn't make any sense but it's the way it is
2008-10-12T19:15:00.000Z	andresmh	dulakian	strange. if it's of any help. it shows that the version of AlsaMixer is v1.0.17
2008-10-12T19:17:00.000Z	dulakian	andresmh	try using the "n" and "p" key to move between the channels on the mixer
2008-10-12T19:17:00.000Z	dulakian	andresmh	n and p are supposed to do the same as the arrows
2008-10-12T19:18:00.000Z	andresmh	dulakian	yeah, n and p do the same as the arrows which is basically selecting either <Master> or <Capture>
2008-10-12T19:19:00.000Z	dulakian	andresmh	sorry man, your mixer is not acting anything like mine
2008-10-12T19:19:00.000Z	andresmh	dulakian	tab lets me change the View, from [Playback] to [Capture] to [All]
2008-10-12T19:19:00.000Z	dulakian	andresmh	on mine the mic was 0, even though the mixer in Xwindows showed everything as on and working
2008-10-12T19:20:00.000Z	dulakian	andresmh	1.0.15
2008-10-12T19:20:00.000Z	andresmh	dulakian	maybe it's the different version, i have1.0.17
2008-10-12T19:20:00.000Z	dulakian	andresmh	I don't see them changing the interface completely in a point release, but maybe
