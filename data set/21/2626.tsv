2009-12-15T00:29:00.000Z	ukev		how can i convert a GPT to an MBR?
2009-12-15T00:29:00.000Z	ssam	ukev	have to completely reformat the disk
2009-12-15T00:30:00.000Z	ssam	ukev	why do you want to go back to mbr?
2009-12-15T00:32:00.000Z	ukev	ssam	the partition is not recognized by other systems (e.g. gentoo) so I have to go back to mbr.
2009-12-15T00:34:00.000Z	ssam	ukev	thats odd gpt has been around for ages
2009-12-15T00:35:00.000Z	ukev	ssam	and why does my 2.6.32 kernel says "unknown partition table" ?
2009-12-15T00:35:00.000Z	ssam	ukev	http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Apple_Macbook
2009-12-15T00:37:00.000Z	ukev	ssam	I have GPT support in my kernel, if you mean that
2009-12-15T00:38:00.000Z	ssam	ukev	i am just sure that getting GPT working in gentoo can't be very hard. i am sure the macbook page will tell you what you need, or you may need to ask in the gentoo forum
2009-12-15T00:39:00.000Z	ukev	ssam	maybe it's a bug... but the guys in #gentoo-kernel have no remaining idea
2009-12-15T00:40:00.000Z	ssam	ukev	could it be a kernel compile option?
2009-12-15T00:41:00.000Z	ukev	ssam	the only thing you need in the kernel to use GPT is CONFIG_EFI_PARTITION=y and I have that one
2009-12-15T00:41:00.000Z	ssam	ukev	ubuntu has CONFIG_EFI_PARTITION=y
2009-12-15T00:41:00.000Z	ssam	ukev	strange. dont think i can help any further
2009-12-15T00:42:00.000Z	ukev	ssam	the only last remaining point I have is:
2009-12-15T00:42:00.000Z	ukev		parted /dev/sdb print
2009-12-15T00:42:00.000Z	ukev		Error: Can't have a partition outside the disk!
2009-12-15T00:42:00.000Z	ssam	ukev	if you want to reformat the disk i recommend gparted. that lets you choose partition table type
2009-12-15T00:43:00.000Z	ukev	ssam	yes but I cannot reformat the disk, because I have no disk where I could store the data in the meantime... :(
2009-12-15T00:43:00.000Z	ssam	ukev	that mean you also have no back of that data?
2009-12-15T00:44:00.000Z	ukev	ssam	this disk is my backup of the data with the history, I don't want to kill this data until I have to..
