2007-06-28T14:54:00.000Z	wols_	RkyRaccoon55	what videocard?
2007-06-28T14:55:00.000Z	RkyRaccoon55	wols_	ati radeon x1950 pro
2007-06-28T14:55:00.000Z	wols_	RkyRaccoon55	you currently use vesa. which can't do that res
2007-06-28T14:55:00.000Z	RkyRaccoon55	wols_	on a previous install of ubuntu it worked fine
2007-06-28T14:56:00.000Z	wols_	RkyRaccoon55	I doubt it. the only drivers that work for you are vesa and flgrx. and fglrx is not installed by default
2007-06-28T14:57:00.000Z	RkyRaccoon55	wols_	doubt it all you want. it was working fine with the ati drivers
2007-06-28T14:57:00.000Z	wols_	RkyRaccoon55	as I said: with fglrx. "ati" si the driver delivered with Xorg. and no, that one does not wrk
2007-06-28T14:57:00.000Z	RkyRaccoon55	wols_	i currently have the same drivers installed but its not working this time.
2007-06-28T14:57:00.000Z	wols_	RkyRaccoon55	no matter what you tell me here
2007-06-28T14:58:00.000Z	RkyRaccoon55	wols_	i used the drivers from ati's site, dont argue about this i know it worked before i re-installed ubuntu
2007-06-28T14:58:00.000Z	wols_	RkyRaccoon55	which dirveers exactly. and don't say "ati". name them differently cause that is ambigous
2007-06-28T14:58:00.000Z	wols_	RkyRaccoon55	if you use those drivers. fine. we don't support them
2007-06-28T14:58:00.000Z	RkyRaccoon55	wols_	and thats fine, but is there any way you could give me a hint as to how to get that resolution to work?
2007-06-28T14:59:00.000Z	wols_	RkyRaccoon55	I already did
2007-06-28T15:03:00.000Z	wols_	RkyRaccoon55	use sudo and gksudo
2007-06-28T15:03:00.000Z	wols_	RkyRaccoon55	probably your monitor refreshrates are wrong btw
2007-06-28T15:04:00.000Z	RkyRaccoon55	wols_	i change them in xorg.conf?
2007-06-28T15:04:00.000Z	wols_	RkyRaccoon55	yes
