2006-06-14T10:58:00.000Z	wastrel	sn00p	 install liballegro
2006-06-14T11:00:00.000Z	wastrel	sn00p	 there's different package names, find them in synaptic
2006-06-14T11:03:00.000Z	wastrel	sn00p	 maybe version mismatch.
2006-06-14T11:03:00.000Z	wastrel	sn00p	 install the version of the library that it wants or compile against the version you've got
2006-09-17T10:45:00.000Z	wastrel	sn00p	 which <command>  gives you the location of the executable
2006-09-17T10:47:00.000Z	sn00p	wastrel	but I search for bittorrent it s ays /usr/share/bittorrent I go into that directory nothing is in there
2006-09-17T10:48:00.000Z	wastrel	sn00p	 are you talking about the default bittorrent client that gnome uses?  that's gnome-btdownload  use   which gnome-btdownload  to find the executable
2006-09-17T10:49:00.000Z	sn00p	wastrel	i cant find it
2006-09-17T10:49:00.000Z	wastrel	sn00p	 what does   which gnome-btdownload   give you?   and what are you trying to accomplish?
2006-09-17T10:50:00.000Z	sn00p	wastrel	lost my default bittorrent client when I open a torrent file in firefox
2006-09-17T10:50:00.000Z	sn00p	wastrel	that command gives me nothing
2006-09-17T10:51:00.000Z	wastrel	sn00p	 are you in kubuntu?   afaik gnome-btdownload is installed by default in ubuntu.
2006-09-17T10:51:00.000Z	sn00p	wastrel	i know I am in ubuntu
2006-09-17T10:52:00.000Z	wastrel	sn00p	 so  sudo aptitude install gnome-btdownload  maybe
2006-09-17T10:52:00.000Z	sn00p	wastrel	 never mind found the problem
2006-09-17T10:52:00.000Z	sn00p	wastrel	the interface was uninstalled or something
