2011-01-25T05:49:00.000Z	itaylor57	eleph	isn't there a plugin for eclipse android sdk?
2011-01-25T05:51:00.000Z	eleph	itaylor57	plugins?
2011-01-25T05:52:00.000Z	itaylor57	eleph	if you are using eclipse to do android sdk you should download the adroid sdk plugin
2011-01-25T05:52:00.000Z	eleph		but that will not allow me to run the commands via term
2011-01-25T05:53:00.000Z	eleph	itaylor57	and I just did that
2011-01-25T05:55:00.000Z	itaylor57	eleph	I can't reproduce, I use open jdk and android sdk needs java sdk sorry
2011-01-25T05:56:00.000Z	itaylor57	eleph	maybe this link can help http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
