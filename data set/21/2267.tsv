2009-11-22T05:29:00.000Z	jberry_	cuong	did you reboot?
2009-11-22T05:29:00.000Z	cuong		i have reboot serveral time.... i just notice of the old kernel while google my sound issue
2009-11-22T05:31:00.000Z	jberry_	cuong	you confirmed you're on the old kernel via "uname -a" etc?  Sounds like the upgrade didn't go.
2009-11-22T05:31:00.000Z	cuong		2.6.28-15-generic
2009-11-22T05:31:00.000Z	cuong	arand	no
2009-11-22T05:32:00.000Z	cuong		the system help indicate as 9.10
2009-11-22T05:32:00.000Z	jberry_	cuong	ouch.  looks like something didn't succeed.  How did you do the upgrade?
2009-11-22T05:32:00.000Z	cuong		Welcome to Xubuntu 9.10!
2009-11-22T05:32:00.000Z	cuong		ouch
2009-11-22T05:33:00.000Z	cuong		through the Upgrade button
2009-11-22T05:34:00.000Z	jberry_	cuong	i've had no problems w/ubuntu; not used xubuntu but I can't believe that's related. Have you tried running update manager to see if it notices things are a bit messed up?
2009-11-22T05:35:00.000Z	cuong		i just ran the update manager, it said my system is up to date
2009-11-22T05:35:00.000Z	jberry_	cuong	an aside... once things are screwy like that, I would make sure I have a good backup of my user data,etc.
2009-11-22T05:36:00.000Z	cuong		so it seems like i will have to reinstall using 9.10 release then?
2009-11-22T05:37:00.000Z	jberry_	cuong	without getting your hands really dirty by playing around with the kernel files themselves, the only thing that comes to mind would be to download a 9.10 CD and do the install from that.
