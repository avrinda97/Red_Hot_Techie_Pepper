2006-10-21T07:23:00.000Z	dr`venom		I love linux, but I seem to find some issue with every distro that I have. Then again, I have only been using linux for a few months. I do hope to abandon windows once I can find a distro that can work properly with my hardware. So far, abuntu is the closest
2006-10-21T07:24:00.000Z	dr`venom		well, my video card works fine in suse, but my sound card does not
2006-10-21T07:24:00.000Z	dr`venom		my sound card works great in ubuntu
2006-10-21T07:24:00.000Z	dr`venom		but not my resolution
2006-10-21T07:25:00.000Z	kitche	dr`venom	what video card?
2006-10-21T07:26:00.000Z	kitche	dr`venom	to get higher res you need the binary driver the nv driver doesn't really support high resolutions
2006-10-21T08:25:00.000Z	kitche	dr`venom	the resolution problem probably has to do with xorg autodetection you might have to add the resolution to your xorg.conf
2006-10-21T08:26:00.000Z	kitche	dr`venom	and restarted gdm and X?
2006-10-21T08:27:00.000Z	kitche	dr`venom	see I don't even mess with the window managers resolution thing since usually they onyl show like five resolutions
2006-10-21T09:12:00.000Z	kitche	dr`venom	can you pastebin your xorg.conf
2006-10-21T09:14:00.000Z	kitche	dr`venom	you paste in a pastebin
2006-10-21T09:19:00.000Z	kitche	dr`venom	yeha that's how I do it it seems to work better

2006-10-21T09:22:00.000Z	kitche	dr`venom	yes you have to restart
2006-10-21T09:31:00.000Z	kitche	dr`venom	it's has a menu at the bottom which will show you the commands to save and such
2006-10-21T09:32:00.000Z	kitche	dr`venom	did you do sudo nano /boot/grub/menu.lst
2006-10-21T09:32:00.000Z	kitche	dr`venom	umm it should have opened up your menu.lst
