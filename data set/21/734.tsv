2011-07-14T00:05:00.000Z	Pici	zykotick9	if you're in X at the time.
2011-07-14T00:05:00.000Z	zykotick9	Pici	what does it do from a VT?
2011-07-14T00:06:00.000Z	Pici	zykotick9	Likely, it will attempt to kill that vtty.
2011-07-14T00:06:00.000Z	Pici	zykotick9	Or the login shell running.  I've never tested it myself.
2011-07-14T00:07:00.000Z	zykotick9	Pici	just brought me back to another login, so yes i guess it does "kill" it.
2011-07-14T00:07:00.000Z	Pici	zykotick9	Its one of the magic sysreq commands, it just happens to work for restartin xorg.

2012-03-27T18:52:00.000Z	zykotick9	Pici	i thought so, but guess no ;)
2012-03-29T17:23:00.000Z	Pici	zykotick9	oh, in hindsight I guess thats not what you were looking for.
2012-03-29T17:23:00.000Z	Pici	zykotick9	sorry.
2012-03-29T17:23:00.000Z	zykotick9	Pici	that motu i'm aware of ;)

2012-04-17T23:59:00.000Z	Pici	zykotick9	er.. I think many people would disagree with you there
2012-04-18T00:00:00.000Z	zykotick9	Pici	the number of "regulars" here that recommend fresh installs seems to support my "often"
2012-05-31T18:51:00.000Z	zykotick9	Pici	thanks

2012-08-16T23:39:00.000Z	zykotick9	Pici	multitail is for multiple file monitoring?
2012-08-16T23:39:00.000Z	Pici	zykotick9	Yes, but it can do single files as well. It does multiple files better than using tail on many files at once.
