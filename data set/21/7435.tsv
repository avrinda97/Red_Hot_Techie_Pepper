2006-10-10T07:23:00.000Z	dragonfyre13		hey guys.
2006-10-10T07:23:00.000Z	dragonfyre13		doing a gentoo install, and figured that I'd inhabit this room for a while when I'm waiting.
2006-10-10T07:23:00.000Z	stribb	dragonfyre13	are you really 13?
2006-10-10T07:23:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	stribb	ummmm, no.
2006-10-10T07:23:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	stribb	19 actually.
2006-10-10T07:24:00.000Z	stribb	dragonfyre13	why not, um, <picks a random channel>, #gentoo?
2006-10-10T07:24:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	stribb	because this is my normal room.
2006-10-10T07:24:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	stribb	I hate the gentoo community, to elite, and I have 6 computers running ubuntu.
2006-10-10T07:25:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	stribb	exactly. ^_^
2006-10-10T07:26:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	stribb	so, how are things? I think I met you once before too? Or do you not use this name constantly?
2006-10-10T07:27:00.000Z	stribb	dragonfyre13	mm, not bad. I just flew to Tokyo to remodel the central downtown because I grew scales and turned green.
2006-10-10T07:29:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	stribb	^_^
2006-10-10T07:34:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	stribb	OmniD "killall <name of process>"
2006-10-10T07:34:00.000Z	stribb	dragonfyre13	no
2006-10-10T07:35:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	stribb	?
2006-10-10T07:35:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	stribb	if you are in front of a solaris, but for what he's doing here it's easier.
2006-10-10T07:35:00.000Z	stribb	dragonfyre13	pkill is better
2006-10-10T07:36:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	stribb	true. I just thought of killall first. I'm the quick and dirty sort.
2006-10-10T07:37:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	stribb	thought his intent was to kill both.
2006-10-10T07:39:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	stribb	be careful, there are N00bs in here.
2006-10-10T07:39:00.000Z	dragonfyre13	stribb	oh nice. I can just see a noob doing that.
