2006-08-25T09:25:00.000Z	BSG75	kaot	bcm43xx
2006-08-25T09:26:00.000Z	kaot	BSG75	outstanding!  that's the best series of cards ever.
2006-08-25T09:26:00.000Z	BSG75	kaot	except Dapper forgot to include the firmwire with it LOL :)
2006-08-25T09:26:00.000Z	kaot	BSG75	not dapper's fault, broadcom are jerks and won't give up the specs
2006-08-25T09:26:00.000Z	BSG75	kaot	absolutely agree
2006-08-25T09:26:00.000Z	BSG75	kaot	but we need better directions
2006-08-25T09:27:00.000Z	BSG75	kaot	I suggest you write to your NTFS :-p
2006-08-25T09:27:00.000Z	BSG75	kaot	sorry can't break what I don't have :)
2006-08-25T09:27:00.000Z	kaot	BSG75	I feel like my whole mind is ntfs right now  :\
2006-08-25T09:28:00.000Z	BSG75	kaot	I recomment cat /proc/troubles >> /dev/null then fsck world then emerge scotch --nodeps --nointterupt :)
