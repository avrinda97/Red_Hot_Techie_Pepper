2006-10-23T11:28:00.000Z	gba		What is the cause of the endless loop the installer goes into between the 5th and 6th step?
2006-10-23T11:30:00.000Z	gba		Can someone help me with installing 6.06, please?
2006-10-23T11:31:00.000Z	gba		Can someone help me with installing 6.06, please?
2006-10-23T11:32:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	gba	what's the problem?
2006-10-23T11:32:00.000Z	gba	TheGateKeeper	The installer goes into an endless loop between the 5th and the 6th step(the step where he wants a partition).
2006-10-23T11:33:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	gba	is this a windows box?
2006-10-23T11:33:00.000Z	gba	TheGateKeeper	He endlessly accesses the cd and the hd
2006-10-23T11:33:00.000Z	gba	TheGateKeeper	I booted from the 6.06 cd
2006-10-23T11:33:00.000Z	gba	TheGateKeeper	So, no it's not a windows machine
2006-10-23T11:34:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	gba	how is it presently partitioned?
2006-10-23T11:35:00.000Z	gba	TheGateKeeper	There are 12 partitions (with some partitions as linux type and with ext3 formatted). On the 6th partition I want to install 6.06
2006-10-23T11:36:00.000Z	gba	TheGateKeeper	Editing the layout of the partitions is not an option because I have fully working installations on the other partitions
2006-10-23T11:36:00.000Z	gba	TheGateKeeper	What can I do to avoid this endless loop
2006-10-23T11:37:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	gba	I assume the partition you want to put it on is over 4Gb, if it isn't then it needs to be, if you do a manual partition it will ask you where to put root, swap etc & it should install correctly
2006-10-23T11:38:00.000Z	gba	TheGateKeeper	The partiotn is 7GB
2006-10-23T11:38:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	gba	you could also use the alternate cd which uses a text installer & should give you more control
2006-10-23T11:39:00.000Z	gba	TheGateKeeper	If I install from the alternate cd do I get the same installation as from the destop cd?
2006-10-23T11:39:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	gba	the end result will be the same
2006-10-23T11:40:00.000Z	gba	TheGateKeeper	Okay, thanks
2006-10-23T11:40:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	gba	the one you are using at the moment uses a gui, the other one a text installer
2006-10-23T11:41:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	gba	I assume that you have also done the self-test on that CD to make sure it's OK?
