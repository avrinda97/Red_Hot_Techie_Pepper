2005-04-06T09:49:00.000Z	hayden		is there any graphical vpn software for kde/ubuntu?
2005-04-06T09:51:00.000Z	tritium	hayden	it's not graphical, but I use vpnc
2005-04-06T09:52:00.000Z	tritium	hayden	make sure you have included universe in your /etc/apt/sources.list, then apt-get install vpnc
2005-04-06T10:06:00.000Z	hayden	tritium	do .pcf files have anythign to do with vpnc?
2005-04-06T10:06:00.000Z	tritium	hayden	are those for Cisco's vpnclient?
2005-04-06T10:07:00.000Z	tritium	hayden	yes?
2005-04-06T10:07:00.000Z	tritium	hayden	no, but they can be converted for use with vpnc
2005-04-06T10:08:00.000Z	tritium	hayden	there's a program called pcf2vpnc
2005-04-06T10:08:00.000Z	tritium	hayden	what architecture are you on?
2005-04-06T10:11:00.000Z	hayden	tritium	i'm on kubuntu hoary
2005-04-06T10:18:00.000Z	hayden	tritium	i tried this but it says permission denied ?, sudo /usr/share/vpnc/pcf2vpnc /home/hayden/vpnclient/Griffith\@Home.pcf > /etc/vpnc/griffith_at_home.conf
2005-04-06T10:19:00.000Z	tritium	hayden	it's the redirection that's causing you trouble with sudo
2005-04-06T10:19:00.000Z	tritium	hayden	as is discuessed here: http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/RootSudo
2005-04-06T10:20:00.000Z	tritium	hayden	either use tee, or break it up into steps
2005-04-06T10:21:00.000Z	tritium	hayden	cool?
2005-04-06T10:21:00.000Z	hayden	tritium	i dunno what tee is
2005-04-06T10:21:00.000Z	tritium	hayden	did you read that URL?
2005-04-06T10:22:00.000Z	tritium	hayden	perhaps just break it up into steps.  First convert the file, into your home dir.  Then, use sudo to copy into the vpnc directory.
2005-04-06T12:40:00.000Z	tritium	hayden	it can be done with nvidia, so I'm sure it can with ati also
2006-06-09T09:47:00.000Z	tritium	hayden	add that user to the admin group
2006-06-09T09:48:00.000Z	hayden	tritium	ok thanks
