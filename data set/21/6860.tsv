2008-08-23T04:06:00.000Z	Pici	nickster500	What type of network card do you have?
2008-08-23T04:07:00.000Z	Pici	nickster500	Well, you said you have the windows drivers, do those tell you?
2008-08-23T04:08:00.000Z	Pici	nickster500	Do you know how to get to a terminal/console in Ubuntu?
2008-08-23T04:09:00.000Z	Pici	nickster500	What version of Windows?
2008-08-23T04:09:00.000Z	Pici	nickster500	okay, hold on a moment.
2008-08-23T04:10:00.000Z	Pici	nickster500	Press the windows key and pause/break at the same time, then click on device-manager
2008-08-23T04:12:00.000Z	Pici	nickster500	On your keyboard, press the windows key and the pause/break key at the same time, then click device manager on the window that comes up.
2008-08-23T04:16:00.000Z	Pici	nickster500	You may want to join ##windows to get help finding your network card model if you do not have another computer to work on while we troubleshoot Linux, its going to make this quite a bit harder for us.
2008-08-23T04:16:00.000Z	Pici	nickster500	Press device manager and tell me what is listed under network adapters
2008-08-23T04:18:00.000Z	Pici	nickster500	Now that we're already here, it doesnt really matter, we just need the name of the network adapters.
2008-08-23T04:22:00.000Z	Pici	nickster500	Allright... broadcom drivers are a bit tricky in linux, so you'll probably want to reboot to ubuntu and connect with wired to set them up.. heres some reading to get started on with though: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WifiDocs/Driver/Broadcom43xx
2008-08-23T04:25:00.000Z	Pici	nickster500	I'm actually not all that good with helping with Broadcom cards, so you may want to ask someone else, but I might still be available if you can't get help :)
