2006-07-19T15:52:00.000Z	Gasolin_		[ HELP]  $depmod -a  command shows Could not open directory /lib/module/2.6.15-23-386.
2006-07-19T15:52:00.000Z	Gasolin_		(I've only 2.6.15-25-386 directory).
2006-07-19T15:53:00.000Z	mwe	Gasolin_	huh? even sudo depmod -a?
2006-07-19T15:54:00.000Z	mwe	Gasolin_	it sounds like you deleted something you shouldn't have
2006-07-19T15:55:00.000Z	mwe	Gasolin_	you can't. your kernel needs modules that match it's version. what does uname -r say?
2006-07-19T15:57:00.000Z	mwe	Gasolin_	that wont work I think. where are you chrooted to?
2006-07-19T15:57:00.000Z	mwe	Gasolin_	what are you trying to do?
2006-07-19T15:58:00.000Z	mwe	Gasolin_	you boot a live cd and try to depmod -a your installed linux system?
2006-07-19T15:58:00.000Z	mwe	Gasolin_	that wont work
2006-07-19T15:58:00.000Z	mwe	Gasolin_	you cannot depmod from a different kernel
2006-07-19T16:00:00.000Z	mwe	Gasolin_	I guess you can depmod a different kernel afterall then, if you specify the version
2006-07-19T16:03:00.000Z	mwe	Gasolin_	well maybe the modules are not loaded
2006-07-19T16:04:00.000Z	mwe	Gasolin_	you need the usb modules to load
2006-07-19T16:05:00.000Z	mwe	Gasolin_	you need to do it in the broken system
2006-07-19T16:05:00.000Z	mwe	Gasolin_	this just list's what's loaded on the live cd
2006-07-19T16:07:00.000Z	mwe	Gasolin_	it's not
2006-07-19T16:07:00.000Z	mwe	Gasolin_	you need to boot the broken system
2006-07-19T16:10:00.000Z	Gasolin_	mwe	if I boot the broken system directly, usb kbd/mouse will not be available. So I'm not sure what you mean?
2006-07-19T16:10:00.000Z	mwe	Gasolin_	I was thinking of using a different keyboard. if you don't have one make sure those module names are mentioned in /etc/modules
2006-07-19T16:12:00.000Z	Gasolin_	mwe	I'm using Dell 2.7G, it doesn't have PS/2 port but USB only, I'm using a USB-to-PS/2(2 port) adapter to link my kbd/mouse
2006-07-19T16:14:00.000Z	Gasolin_	mwe	I can use kbd in GRUB or Bios, but not not work in Ubuntu GUI
