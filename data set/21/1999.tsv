2010-02-17T21:17:00.000Z	iceroot	Guest22920	ah yes, vim is not installed by default, use vi instead of vim
2010-02-17T21:17:00.000Z	iceroot	Guest22920	or use nano, i think its easier for you
2010-02-17T21:18:00.000Z	iceroot	Guest22920	in vi? or nano?
2010-02-17T21:18:00.000Z	iceroot	Guest22920	esc :wq  to save
2010-02-17T21:19:00.000Z	iceroot	Guest22920	with esc you go into command-mode and then type  :wq
