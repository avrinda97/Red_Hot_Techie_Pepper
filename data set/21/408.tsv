2012-01-06T15:17:00.000Z	Knorre		is it normal for apt-get distr-upgrade to take long?
2012-01-06T15:17:00.000Z	Knorre		i see
2012-01-06T15:18:00.000Z	Knorre		any estimate on how long exactly?
2012-01-06T15:18:00.000Z	Knorre		well all packages downloaded pretty fast, it's the installation process that takes long
2012-01-06T15:19:00.000Z	Knorre		oh i guess i'll just clean some stuff up here :)
2012-01-06T15:19:00.000Z	nightshade209	Knorre	 :)
2012-01-06T15:17:00.000Z	nightshade209	Knorre	yes, very long
2012-01-06T15:18:00.000Z	nightshade209	Knorre	depends on your net speed and what you are upgrading to
2012-01-06T15:18:00.000Z	nightshade209	Knorre	but i would take a nice long lunch break or something
2012-01-06T15:18:00.000Z	nightshade209	Knorre	then about 30 min
2012-01-06T15:18:00.000Z	nightshade209	Knorre	or max 45
2012-01-06T15:36:00.000Z	Knorre	nightshade209	the upgrading finished, but i still get problems trying to install gnome-shell-extensions-user-theme
2012-01-06T15:37:00.000Z	nightshade209	Knorre	does it give the dependency package?
2012-01-06T15:37:00.000Z	Knorre	nightshade209	http://pastebin.com/C9fSgi8c
2012-01-06T15:38:00.000Z	nightshade209	Knorre	sudo apt-get install gnome-shell-extensions-common gnome-shell-extensions-user-theme
2012-01-06T15:39:00.000Z	nightshade209	Knorre	the ppa might have gotten deselected during the upgrade, check under Software Sources
2012-01-06T15:40:00.000Z	Knorre	nightshade209	i re-added the ppas after upgrading
2012-01-06T15:41:00.000Z	Knorre	nightshade209	http://pastebin.com/wSVP2vzB
2012-01-06T15:43:00.000Z	nightshade209	Knorre	umm, sorry, can't think of anything right now
2012-01-06T16:01:00.000Z	nightshade209	Knorre	your system might not be very usable if you reboot
2012-01-06T16:01:00.000Z	nightshade209	Knorre	don't reboot until you resolve the issue
