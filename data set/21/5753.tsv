2008-01-27T23:56:00.000Z	nickrud	pvl1	grep  agpart /var/log/Xorg.0.log , does it say something about an error?
2008-01-27T23:57:00.000Z	pvl1	nickrud	no, returns nothing
2008-01-27T23:58:00.000Z	nickrud	pvl1	put a copy of /var/log/Xorg.0.log on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org , maybe something will hit me between the eys

2008-01-28T00:02:00.000Z	nickrud	pvl1	let me see your /etc/X11/xorg.conf , the aiglx thing comes after the dri should be enabled, so it's not the real error
2008-01-28T00:04:00.000Z	pvl1	nickrud	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/53754/

2008-01-28T00:06:00.000Z	nickrud	pvl1	of course, make a backup of the conf file first :)
2008-01-28T00:14:00.000Z	pvl1	nickrud	apperently direct rendering is still off.
2008-01-28T00:16:00.000Z	nickrud	pvl1	I'm not sure what would be the problem, like I said I'm not real familiar with that chip. Just checked the obvious stuff with you. Sorry
2008-01-28T00:16:00.000Z	pvl1	nickrud	oh well thanks anyway
