2008-01-07T03:57:00.000Z	mobiusthought		so can anyone tell me how to roll back a kernel update? I need to install my nvidia driver, and I can't because I would need kernel-sources, which neither Synaptic nor apt-get can find
2008-01-07T03:58:00.000Z	mobiusthought		foug- you can if you've set up your hard drive to use LVM, which I always recommend
2008-01-07T03:59:00.000Z	mobiusthought		foug- if you set it up yourself, and you don't know, you probably don't have LVM
2008-01-07T04:00:00.000Z	mobiusthought		robdig- ah, I DO have more options in my bootloader now.. wasn't sure what that was.. thansk
2008-01-07T04:01:00.000Z	mobiusthought		chuy- what type of partition is it?
2008-01-07T04:03:00.000Z	chuy	mobiusthought	/msg NickServ IDENTIFY
2008-01-07T04:04:00.000Z	chuy	mobiusthought	NTFS http://img2.freeimagehosting.net/image.php?cbbb475891.png sorry about the Identify... that was something else.
2008-01-07T04:07:00.000Z	chuy	mobiusthought	Here: http://img2.freeimagehosting.net/image.php?e3c6366649.png WTH?
2008-01-07T04:25:00.000Z	chuy	mobiusthought	Ok, I formatted the troublemaking harddrive to ext3. Now, I would like to mount it. When I type in "sudo mount -t ntsf-3g /dev/sdb1 /media/Spidora -o force" I get "mount: unknown filesystem type 'ntsf-3g'".
2008-01-07T04:30:00.000Z	chuy	mobiusthought	Ok, when I entered "sudo mount -t /dev/sdb1 /media/Spidora -o force" this is what I got: http://pastebin.com/m67d8fbf2
2008-01-07T04:34:00.000Z	chuy	mobiusthought	If the harddrive is /dev/hdb, do I use sdb1?
2008-01-07T04:35:00.000Z	chuy	mobiusthought	I still get the same messge
2008-01-07T04:38:00.000Z	chuy	mobiusthought	Now I'm getting the "mount: you must specify the filesystem type" message

2008-01-07T04:50:00.000Z	chuy	mobiusthought	Ok, Spidora now has something named Lost+Found in it, but I can't open it. What is this?
2008-01-07T04:54:00.000Z	chuy	mobiusthought	No error...
2008-01-07T04:56:00.000Z	chuy	mobiusthought	No, It seems the permissions are all screwed up. How can I change this?
2008-01-07T04:57:00.000Z	chuy	mobiusthought	done.
2008-01-07T04:58:00.000Z	chuy	mobiusthought	"/dev/hdb1 /media/Spidora ext3 defaults,locale=en_US.UTF-8 0 0" Right?
2008-01-07T04:59:00.000Z	chuy	mobiusthought	What do you mean "defaults"?
2008-01-07T05:03:00.000Z	chuy	mobiusthought	So my line should be correct?
