2006-04-26T15:24:00.000Z	Fred		How do I install SNMP? I *think* I installed some kind of SNMPd but it doesn't seem to work :/
2006-04-26T15:24:00.000Z	teun	Fred	client or server?
2006-04-26T15:31:00.000Z	teun	Fred	i don't know any short tutorials, but the 'snmpconf' tool in the 'snmp' package might be a nice start
2006-04-26T15:45:00.000Z	teun	Fred	you can use the snmpwalk tool
2006-04-26T15:49:00.000Z	teun	Fred	and you have a running snmpd process?
2006-04-26T15:51:00.000Z	teun	Fred	and lsof -i | grep snmp shows a snmpd process bound to localhost?
2006-04-26T15:52:00.000Z	teun	Fred	that's ok
2006-04-26T15:53:00.000Z	teun	Fred	what happens if you telnet to port 161?
2006-04-26T15:55:00.000Z	teun	Fred	what was the exact snmpwalk command you tried?
2006-04-26T15:56:00.000Z	teun	Fred	hmm, thats smux... not needed for this
2006-04-26T15:56:00.000Z	teun	Fred	can you show me your com2sec lines in your /etc/snmpd.conf?
2006-04-26T15:57:00.000Z	teun	Fred	hmmm, fascinating
2006-04-26T15:58:00.000Z	teun	Fred	can you put your config on pastebin or something where I can see it?
2006-04-26T15:59:00.000Z	teun	Fred	ok i'll take a look
2006-04-27T16:02:00.000Z	teun	Fred	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/12696  <-- my 'working' snmpd.conf on one of my boxes
2006-04-27T16:04:00.000Z	teun	Fred	NET-SNMP version:  5.2.2
2006-04-27T16:15:00.000Z	teun	Fred	hmmm no, sorry
2006-04-27T16:12:00.000Z	teun	Fred	what kind of probs?
2006-04-27T16:14:00.000Z	teun	Fred	hmmm
2006-04-27T16:14:00.000Z	teun	Fred	doesn't ring a bell :(
