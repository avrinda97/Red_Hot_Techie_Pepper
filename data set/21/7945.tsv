2006-07-07T12:01:00.000Z	Crescendo		Use /join #ubuntu-es
2006-07-07T12:01:00.000Z	Crescendo		AHA!  ALT-ENTER worked!
2006-07-07T12:01:00.000Z	Crescendo		=D
2006-07-07T12:02:00.000Z	Crescendo		Now, how to switch workspaces?
2006-07-07T12:02:00.000Z	jrib	Crescendo	system > preferences > keyboard shortcuts, you can setup what you want.  Default is ctrl-alt-<arrow keys>
2006-07-07T12:03:00.000Z	Crescendo	jrib	I can't access that.
2006-12-09T15:44:00.000Z	jrib	Crescendo	vim
2006-12-09T15:47:00.000Z	Crescendo	jrib	I'd like to use a graphic interface, though
2006-12-09T15:47:00.000Z	jrib	Crescendo	gvim
2006-12-09T15:48:00.000Z	Crescendo	jrib	sudo apt-get install vim-gnome
2006-12-09T15:48:00.000Z	jrib	Crescendo	yep
2006-12-09T15:49:00.000Z	Crescendo	jrib	nope, still does nothing
2006-12-09T15:50:00.000Z	jrib	Crescendo	what do you mean "does nothing"?  What are you trying to do and how?
2006-12-09T15:51:00.000Z	jrib	Crescendo	hmm don't know how nautilus handles it.  Try 'gvim ftp://foobar'
2007-02-06T10:37:00.000Z	jrib	Crescendo	take a break, go for a walk
2008-05-06T04:15:00.000Z	jrib	Crescendo	huh?  "recursive mv"  What exactly did you type?
2008-05-06T04:15:00.000Z	Crescendo	jrib	find /foo -name "*.jpg" -exec mv {} /bar/FletchCon \;
2008-05-06T04:16:00.000Z	jrib	Crescendo	so /bar/FletchCon didn't exist before?
2008-05-06T04:16:00.000Z	Crescendo	jrib	correct
2008-05-06T04:16:00.000Z	jrib	Crescendo	only way to undo is with your backups
