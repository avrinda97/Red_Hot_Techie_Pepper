2007-02-26T16:29:00.000Z	ikonia	oggy	your in your home dir - the installer is on the cd
2007-02-26T16:29:00.000Z	ikonia	oggy	you can't run the command from your home dir when the installer is on the cd
2007-02-26T16:30:00.000Z	ikonia	oggy	you need to be in the same directory as the command and do ./$command
2007-02-26T16:30:00.000Z	ikonia	oggy	you have to be in the same dir as the command
