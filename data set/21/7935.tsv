2006-06-17T11:36:00.000Z	efox		i set up linux with a 10GB allocation from my 60GB harddrive. If i want to add more space to it, i can have the ability to correct..i mean..i wont have to reinstall everything. I can mount a new partition for my /root and such ?
2006-06-17T11:37:00.000Z	witless	efox	yes
2006-06-17T11:38:00.000Z	witless	efox	why would you need a big /root partition?  you're not using root as your working account are you?  :-)
2006-06-17T11:43:00.000Z	efox	witless	yes..i am :(
2006-06-17T11:43:00.000Z	witless	efox	why??
2006-06-17T11:44:00.000Z	efox	witless	cuz i wasnt too sure on what should be what...i set 128mb for boot (which is think is crazy high) 700mb for swap and the rest root
2006-06-17T11:45:00.000Z	witless	efox	oh, you mean root as in / , not root as in root-user
2006-06-17T11:45:00.000Z	efox	witless	yes  '/'
2006-06-17T11:45:00.000Z	witless	efox	ok, nevermind  :-)
2006-06-17T11:46:00.000Z	witless	efox	if you start running out of space, and you have more partitions, you can move stuff from e.g. /home to the new partition and then mount the new partition at the /home location
2006-06-17T11:47:00.000Z	efox	witless	cool...well i have 6.5gb now, and i may want more in the comin weeks..
2006-06-17T11:49:00.000Z	witless	efox	there is a setting in menu.lst called "default"  - set that to the OS you want to boot (first in list is 0, then 1, then 2, etc)
2006-06-17T11:53:00.000Z	efox	witless	i dont see that 'default' option
2006-06-17T11:53:00.000Z	witless	efox	what option?
2006-06-17T11:53:00.000Z	witless	efox	oh right
2006-06-17T11:53:00.000Z	efox	witless	 efox: there is a setting in menu.lst called "default"
2006-06-17T11:54:00.000Z	witless	efox	yes, there is - in my copy of menu.lst, it's the first option.
2006-06-17T11:54:00.000Z	efox	witless	oh i c it now...   default num
2006-06-17T11:55:00.000Z	efox	witless	so if i have 4 entries in my grub, and i want my last entry (windows xp) to be the primary, i set that num to..3 or 4 ?
2006-06-17T11:55:00.000Z	witless	efox	3
2006-06-17T11:56:00.000Z	witless	efox	give it a shot
