2007-11-25T00:34:00.000Z	tritium	LtEmerpoc	you don't need to be one to use ubuntu
2007-11-25T00:37:00.000Z	tritium	LtEmerpoc	is this a fresh gutsy install?  What video card do you have?
2007-11-25T00:37:00.000Z	tritium	LtEmerpoc	no, not the monitor.  The video card.
2007-11-25T00:50:00.000Z	tritium	LtEmerpoc	you need to enable the restricted section of the repositories
2007-11-25T00:51:00.000Z	tritium	LtEmerpoc	System -> Administration -> Software Sources
2007-11-25T00:51:00.000Z	tritium	LtEmerpoc	then you'll make the fglrx packages available
2007-11-25T00:52:00.000Z	tritium	LtEmerpoc	you'll see a checkbox
2007-11-25T00:52:00.000Z	tritium	LtEmerpoc	did you already try System -> Administration -> Restricted Drivers Manager?

2007-11-25T00:53:00.000Z	tritium	LtEmerpoc	okay, so enable it as I suggested to you
2007-11-25T00:54:00.000Z	tritium	LtEmerpoc	after enabling, you'll have to reload the package lists (e.g. sudo apt-get update, or via synaptic, etc.)
2007-11-25T00:56:00.000Z	tritium	LtEmerpoc	please use my full nick, or I won't see the hilight
