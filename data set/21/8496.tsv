2006-03-24T06:53:00.000Z	yamathan		How do I go about installing KDE in a typical Ubuntu 5.1 setup?
2006-03-24T06:55:00.000Z	yamathan		Good.  I just reset my password.
2006-03-24T06:57:00.000Z	yamathan		Can I install KDE in Ubuntu?
2006-03-24T06:57:00.000Z	clem_yeats	yamathan	: yes
2006-03-24T06:57:00.000Z	clem_yeats	yamathan	:  sudo aptitude install kubuntu-desktop
2006-03-24T06:58:00.000Z	yamathan	clem_yeats	Thanks.
2006-03-24T06:58:00.000Z	clem_yeats	yamathan	: you can also get kde 3.5.1 if you change your repos..
2006-03-24T06:58:00.000Z	yamathan		O_o;;
2006-03-24T06:58:00.000Z	yamathan		Whaaaa?
2006-03-24T06:59:00.000Z	yamathan		It's nigh on 475 megs' worth of data.
2006-03-24T06:59:00.000Z	yamathan		I'll install kubuntu-desktop overnight or something.
2006-03-24T06:59:00.000Z	clem_yeats	yamathan	: it's fast. Well.. I did the opposite, I started from a fresh kubuntu and installed ubuntu-desktop :)
2006-03-24T07:00:00.000Z	yamathan	clem_yeats	 I suppose GNOME is lighter than KDE.
2006-03-24T07:00:00.000Z	clem_yeats	yamathan	: hmm.. I like both, so I install both , simple as that :)
2006-03-24T07:01:00.000Z	yamathan	clem_yeats	Fedora Core 4 gave me the luxury of installing both at startup.
2006-03-24T07:01:00.000Z	yamathan	clem_yeats	I mean to say both at installation.
2006-03-24T07:01:00.000Z	clem_yeats	yamathan	: but the magic of ubuntu is to come in one CD.
2006-03-24T07:02:00.000Z	clem_yeats	yamathan	: and with free shipping !
2006-03-24T07:02:00.000Z	yamathan	clem_yeats	Including both environments?
2006-03-24T07:02:00.000Z	clem_yeats	yamathan	: no..
2006-03-24T07:02:00.000Z	yamathan	clem_yeats	Ah.
