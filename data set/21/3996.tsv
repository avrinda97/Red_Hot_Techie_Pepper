2008-09-06T12:29:00.000Z	nnull		im trying to make a VPN for VNC i want to connect the XP box from the ubuntu box?
2008-09-06T12:29:00.000Z	nnull		i need ssh for this?
2008-09-06T12:30:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	nnull	you can tunnel vnc through an ssh connection ... that is simpler than setting up a vpn i think
2008-09-06T12:32:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	nnull	man vncviewer and check out the -via switch ... another option is nomachineNX which is much faster for me ... somethings to check out
2008-09-06T12:32:00.000Z	nnull	ushimitsudoki	ok cool, and what vnc server would you recommend for windows xp?
2008-09-06T12:33:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	nnull	real vnc i guess ... i don't take winxp seriously so take it for what it's worth
2008-09-06T12:34:00.000Z	nnull	ushimitsudoki	yea well XP is the best os for what that pc does (rips movies/office stuff)
2008-09-11T18:24:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	nnull	i have the CD in front of me for 8.04 and it says "at least 4GB of disk space available for installation". I bet you could squeeze it in much less, but there it is official-like
2008-09-11T18:25:00.000Z	nnull	ushimitsudoki	:x
2008-09-11T18:30:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	nnull	i bet you can squeeze it on there (or you could try the server install and then add packages) ... why not try it and see? it might make a good forum or blog post
2008-09-11T18:33:00.000Z	nnull	ushimitsudoki	im thinking the install cannot be 4/8 gig as they proclaim as the iso is only 700 meg?
2008-09-11T18:34:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	nnull	compression? I'm only reading the CD text - plus you will be downloading stuff too. Still, I would try it with 3G
2008-09-11T18:35:00.000Z	nnull	ushimitsudoki	do you think i should merge the swap with the 3gig part and run no swap?
2008-09-11T18:35:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	nnull	how much RAM do you have there?
2008-09-11T18:36:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	nnull	then 512 as a swap will be enough
2008-09-11T18:37:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	nnull	i don't know why, double the ram seems generous to me, but that's just my opinion
2008-09-11T18:37:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	nnull	i like to have /home on a separate partition, but it is not required
2008-09-11T18:38:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	nnull	since you have limited size, you might want to forgo that separation ... just a thought
2008-09-11T18:38:00.000Z	nnull	ushimitsudoki	any particular reason you prefer that mate?
2008-09-11T18:38:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	nnull	because I have huge ass harddrives and can roll like that :)
2008-09-11T18:39:00.000Z	nnull	ushimitsudoki	^
