2007-05-22T05:52:00.000Z	Bluhd	prayer_tramontan	thunderbird
2007-05-22T06:08:00.000Z	Bluhd	prayer_tramontan	yeah, load synaptic and do a package search for "thunderbird"
2007-05-22T06:08:00.000Z	Bluhd	prayer_tramontan	if you're new to linux you'll learn how wonderful synaptic is and you'll never ever dislike it :P
2007-05-22T07:08:00.000Z	Bluhd	prayer_tramontan	if you want to update it'll take several hours to get all the new files
2007-05-22T07:09:00.000Z	prayer_tramontan	Bluhd	i download with 1600kb/sk how much does it occupate?
2007-05-22T07:10:00.000Z	Bluhd	prayer_tramontan	oh, you must have the 10meg thing from insight
2007-05-22T07:10:00.000Z	prayer_tramontan	Bluhd	I have 15mbit from my ISP, but i receive about 16mbit
2007-05-22T07:11:00.000Z	Bluhd	prayer_tramontan	nice! it shouldn't take that long then
2007-05-22T07:11:00.000Z	Bluhd	prayer_tramontan	now, before you upgrade
2007-05-22T07:11:00.000Z	Bluhd	prayer_tramontan	I need to know some things: Are you going from 6.10 to 7.04 without using a CD?
2007-05-22T07:11:00.000Z	prayer_tramontan	Bluhd	Yes i dont wanna burn a cd if its not nessesary
2007-05-22T07:11:00.000Z	Bluhd	prayer_tramontan	ok
2007-05-22T07:12:00.000Z	prayer_tramontan	Bluhd	Where can I update then ?
2007-05-22T07:12:00.000Z	Bluhd	prayer_tramontan	 just a sec
2007-05-22T07:12:00.000Z	prayer_tramontan	Bluhd	thank you :)
2007-05-22T07:12:00.000Z	Bluhd	prayer_tramontan	sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
2007-05-22T07:13:00.000Z	prayer_tramontan	Bluhd	Should i write that in my terminal ?
2007-05-22T07:13:00.000Z	Bluhd	prayer_tramontan	you're probably better off running update-manager
2007-05-22T07:14:00.000Z	prayer_tramontan	Bluhd	I think sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list is a bit difficult to me
2007-05-22T07:15:00.000Z	Bluhd	prayer_tramontan	yes, follow what soundray is telling you. The method I was about to suggest is the hard way :P
