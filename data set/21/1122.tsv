2011-10-03T14:16:00.000Z	KM0201	A_J	save, and restart... now listen.. if it doesn't mount (it should)... it'll tell you there's an error, and to hit a key to skip mounting... then come back here, and i'll try to figure out the problem.
2011-10-03T14:22:00.000Z	KM0201	A_J	just let it boot... but bastidrazor is right, sudo mount -a would have worked fine.
