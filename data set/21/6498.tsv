2009-02-07T05:05:00.000Z	Brett_Laptop		I'm moving from Windows to Unbuntu, though I am having troubles.. can someone help me.
2009-02-07T05:06:00.000Z	Brett_Laptop		I need to install it from USB stick, but im not sure how to put the ISO on it so it is bootable..
2009-02-07T05:06:00.000Z	Brett_Laptop		Does anyone know how to do this, so I can install ubuntu?
2009-02-07T05:06:00.000Z	uplinked	Brett_Laptop	do you have a windows box lying around?
2009-02-07T05:06:00.000Z	uplinked	Brett_Laptop	http://pendrivelinux.com has bat files
2009-02-07T05:07:00.000Z	uplinked	Brett_Laptop	that will download the iso, unpack it, and make your drive bootable
2009-02-07T05:07:00.000Z	uplinked	Brett_Laptop	you can also use UNetBootIn, which is additionally multi-platform and supports TONS of distros/versions, but i've found that the pendrivelinux bat files work more reliably from windows
2009-02-07T05:09:00.000Z	uplinked	Brett_Laptop	format the stick to fat32
2009-02-07T05:09:00.000Z	uplinked	Brett_Laptop	download the proper bat file for ubuntu 8.10 to your desktop, and run it
2009-02-07T05:09:00.000Z	uplinked	Brett_Laptop	it'll download the iso to your desktop, unpack it, move it to your flash drive, then make your drive bootable
2009-02-07T05:10:00.000Z	uplinked	Brett_Laptop	if you're on Vista with UAC enabled, making the drive bootable will fail- after it's all done, then navigate to the drive, manually, right click on "makeboot.bat" and click "run as administrator." it'll tell you to do this.
2009-02-07T05:12:00.000Z	uplinked	Brett_Laptop	use this

2009-02-07T05:13:00.000Z	uplinked	Brett_Laptop	it's 8.10 instead of 8.04 :) unless you wanted LTE. the first link under "Step One" is the only thing you need to download, it'll automate the rest for you
2009-02-07T05:15:00.000Z	uplinked	Brett_Laptop	8.10 is the newest stable release. 8.04 is "long-term support edition", which will have technical support for a garunteed 3 years. if you intend to upgrade to newer versions as they're released, LTE (8.04) is nothing more to you than "an old version"
2009-02-07T05:16:00.000Z	uplinked	Brett_Laptop	I used mint for ~1 month, didn't like it much
2009-02-07T05:17:00.000Z	uplinked	Brett_Laptop	it felt like Ubuntu with a sack over it's head.
2009-02-07T05:17:00.000Z	uplinked	Brett_Laptop	use this one -- http://www.pendrivelinux.com/usb-ubuntu-810-install-from-windows-non-persistent/
2009-02-07T05:18:00.000Z	uplinked	Brett_Laptop	have you partitioned your disk for dual booting yet? or is vista taking up the full thing?
2009-02-07T05:18:00.000Z	uplinked	Brett_Laptop	i'd advise against trying to resize the NTFS drive, i just did that yesterday and wound up hosing my vista install
2009-02-07T05:22:00.000Z	uplinked	Brett_Laptop	Glad to help, good luck!
