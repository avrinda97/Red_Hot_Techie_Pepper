2007-03-23T16:47:00.000Z	Stormx2		Please can someone tell me if they have a setup where more than one app can write sound?!
2007-03-23T16:47:00.000Z	Stormx2		To the mixer.
2007-03-23T16:48:00.000Z	Stormx2		I don't know >.< Its an oldish card.
2007-03-23T16:48:00.000Z	Stormx2		It might just be my software setup? It mixes fine on windows.
2007-03-23T16:50:00.000Z	Stormx2		Okay.
2007-03-23T16:51:00.000Z	Stormx2		How can I find my alsa version?
2007-03-23T05:14:00.000Z	Stormx2		Could someone recommend to me a nice way of finding the largest _directories_ within the current directory?
2007-03-23T05:16:00.000Z	neozen	Stormx2	du
2007-03-23T05:17:00.000Z	Stormx2	neozen	Don't worry, got it
2007-07-19T05:41:00.000Z	Stormx2	neozen	Worst idea ever?
2007-07-19T05:41:00.000Z	neozen	Stormx2	lol... mine or his?
2007-07-19T05:41:00.000Z	neozen	Stormx2	but can it write to ext3 just as easily?
2007-07-19T05:42:00.000Z	neozen	Stormx2	and what is the name of this driver?
2007-07-19T05:42:00.000Z	Stormx2	neozen	Yours. FAT is old, unjournalled, awful character set, and a limit on file size.
2007-07-19T05:42:00.000Z	Stormx2	neozen	I'll find it. It's called IFS or something.
2007-07-19T05:43:00.000Z	neozen	Stormx2	true... but can't beat it for os compatibility
2007-07-19T05:43:00.000Z	neozen	Stormx2	and can this driver do write access to ext3?
2007-07-19T05:43:00.000Z	Stormx2	neozen	It can.
2007-07-19T05:43:00.000Z	neozen	Stormx2	thank you
2007-07-19T05:43:00.000Z	Stormx2	neozen	And that's a small gain over a huge loss.
2007-07-19T05:43:00.000Z	neozen	Stormx2	true...
