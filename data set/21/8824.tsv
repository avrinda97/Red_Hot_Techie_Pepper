2007-10-14T06:59:00.000Z	IdleOne	jeroen__	try asking in #winehq they should be able to help you more
2007-10-14T07:01:00.000Z	IdleOne	jeroen__	try this dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg ( when in doubt go with the defaul answer | [09:01:12]  <cafuego> Run  dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, add it to allowed resolutions when asked, wine should then be able to switch to it.
2007-10-14T07:03:00.000Z	IdleOne	jeroen__	a screen will come up with all the resoluitons to select the ones you want hit the space bar and use arrow keys to scroll up and down

2007-10-14T07:07:00.000Z	IdleOne	jeroen__	cedega is not free but if it is worth it to you then you can decide to pay for it
2007-10-14T07:08:00.000Z	IdleOne	jeroen__	google cedega and give it a sho
2007-10-14T07:13:00.000Z	IdleOne	jeroen__	I understand your frustration but it is not Linux fault it is the games manufacturers who dont provide good linux support for the games
