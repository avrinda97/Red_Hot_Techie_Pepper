2007-05-29T10:32:00.000Z	kmag		syslog thought it was important to send me an unsolicited message:  kernel: [16213.191708]  Oops: 0000 [1]  SMP
2007-05-29T10:32:00.000Z	kmag		What is Oops 0000 [1]  SMP ?
2007-05-29T10:33:00.000Z	kmag		syslog also gives me the value of CR2
2007-05-29T10:34:00.000Z	kmag		brueng: I thought someone modified apt-get to also work w/ RPM
2007-05-29T10:34:00.000Z	bruenig	kmag	I don't think so
2007-05-29T10:52:00.000Z	bruenig	kmag	but those drivers are not windows, those were reverse engineered
2007-05-29T10:54:00.000Z	kmag	bruenig	last time I used captive, I needed to use the Linux NTFS ro-driver to copy the MS NTFS driver out to my ext3 partition, then run captive to get rw-access
2007-05-29T10:54:00.000Z	bruenig	kmag	there is ntfs rw support in the kernel, you can read the source if you want, that source certainly wasn't made open
2007-05-29T10:55:00.000Z	kmag	bruenig	captive uses code from ReactOS and Wine to get the genuine MS NTFS driver running and happy in ring 3 ...
2007-05-29T10:55:00.000Z	bruenig	kmag	made open by windows that is
2007-05-29T10:55:00.000Z	bruenig	kmag	I don't know why you would use that when you have built in kernel support
2007-05-29T10:56:00.000Z	kmag	bruenig	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captive_NTFS
2007-05-29T10:56:00.000Z	bruenig	kmag	kernel.org
2007-05-29T10:56:00.000Z	kmag	bruenig	like I said "last time I used it"
2007-05-29T10:56:00.000Z	kmag	bruenig	several years ago
2007-05-29T10:57:00.000Z	kmag	bruenig	so NTFS rw support is no longer an experimental option?
2007-05-29T10:57:00.000Z	bruenig	kmag	assuming you compile it into the kernel, it is good to go
2007-05-29T10:58:00.000Z	kmag	bruenig	ntfs-3g is a FUSE driver
2007-05-29T10:58:00.000Z	bruenig	kmag	I was compiling a kernel probably 2 months ago, and it was a new option
2007-05-29T10:58:00.000Z	kmag	bruenig	so most of it isn't in the kernel, but in userspace
2007-05-29T10:59:00.000Z	kmag	bruenig	cool... a few years ago it was available, if you enabled experimental options
