2005-08-03T10:18:00.000Z	bob2	nothingsometing	did you set the correct work group?
2005-08-03T10:22:00.000Z	bob2	nothingsometing	enable anonymous sharing then
2005-08-03T10:22:00.000Z	nothingsometing	bob2	if i could do that i could probbally create users right?
2005-08-03T10:24:00.000Z	nothingsometing	bob2	i tought that windows xp demanded authenication
2005-08-03T10:25:00.000Z	nothingsometing	bob2	or someone where is the config file that lets me create groups and users and permisions
2005-08-03T10:31:00.000Z	bob2	nothingsometing	just use an anonymouse share... /etc/samba/smb.conf explains how
2005-08-03T10:37:00.000Z	nothingsometing	bob2	i found the smb.config document b4 loging on but i thought that that was the actual config file for samba if that isn't then what is the file that i would actualy need to edit in a word processor, it soulds like you are saying th smb.conf file is more like a refrance than a editing document or am i still cnfused?
2005-08-03T10:37:00.000Z	bob2	nothingsometing	/etc/samba/smb.conf is the config file, iirc
2005-08-03T10:38:00.000Z	nothingsometing	bob2	 it will also tell me how to edit itself properly?
2005-08-03T10:38:00.000Z	bob2	nothingsometing	yes
2005-08-03T10:39:00.000Z	bob2	nothingsometing	just copy one of the blocks at the bottom (like the cdrom one) and edit it
2005-08-03T10:48:00.000Z	nothingsometing	bob2	can i also create users, groups, and permissions with this same config file???????
2005-08-03T10:57:00.000Z	bob2	nothingsometing	no, if you want users and groups you have to go find a samba howto
2005-08-03T10:57:00.000Z	bob2	nothingsometing	#samba can no doubt point you at the right places
2005-08-03T10:58:00.000Z	bob2	nothingsometing	dude
2005-08-03T10:58:00.000Z	bob2	nothingsometing	type "samba howto" in to google
2005-08-03T10:58:00.000Z	bob2	nothingsometing	look at the second line
2005-08-03T10:59:00.000Z	nothingsometing	bob2	google linux or google normal
2005-08-03T10:59:00.000Z	bob2	nothingsometing	either
