2010-05-29T07:28:00.000Z	laplatadonna		how do i change what programs go under the little mail icon by the clock in the top panel?
2010-05-29T07:28:00.000Z	laplatadonna		i want to add some stuff.
2010-05-29T07:29:00.000Z	Ken1	laplatadonna	That's the indicator applet you're looking to change. There are some specific behaviours for the applications that are added there, so be mindful that not everything will "work" as they intend it to. You can, however, add other application icons there, or remove current ones.. I'll just get you a lin

2010-05-29T07:30:00.000Z	laplatadonna	Ken1	thanks! :-)
2010-05-29T07:30:00.000Z	Ken1	laplatadonna	Glad to help.
2010-05-29T07:37:00.000Z	Ken1	laplatadonna	Even though you're the sole user, you still need to tell it that you want to use "Higher" privledges.
2010-05-29T07:38:00.000Z	Ken1	laplatadonna	Are you using Gnome?
2010-05-29T07:38:00.000Z	laplatadonna	Ken1	yes gnome
2010-05-29T07:38:00.000Z	Ken1	laplatadonna	I'd suggest you open up the terminal and type: "Sudo nautilus" then it'll prompt you for your password. Be very _very_ careful what do you though.
2010-05-29T07:39:00.000Z	Ken1	laplatadonna	You'll have to do it again for editing the files in that folder. Bastid_raZor pointed us to a useful link too which might be better than "Sudo nautilus"
2010-05-29T07:41:00.000Z	Ken1	laplatadonna	As Bastid_raZor suggested (thanks) - open up a terminal and type "gksudo nautlius" to open up an administrator privleged window.
2010-05-29T07:42:00.000Z	Ken1	laplatadonna	Then go to the folder you're try to get access to - you should be free to add, delete and change anything. Like I said though, be very careful - Linux is ruthless, it'll do exactly what you tell it to do.
2010-05-29T07:43:00.000Z	laplatadonna	Ken1	that's why i love it. i've had my 2 personal computers running linux for a year without troubles. and one is a tablet pc and it supports everything on it, including the digitizer and touchscreen...now im converting my family one by one. this isnt even my irc account, just one i set up so mom can talk to me directly without picking up the phone
2010-05-29T07:44:00.000Z	Ken1	laplatadonna	One of the reasons I like it too, but also why things have gone wrong. I've had to wrestle for some features but heck, i'm 23, it's 3:43am and I'm off work for six weeks with a broken neck - what else am I going to do?
2010-05-29T07:46:00.000Z	laplatadonna	Ken1	and its so much faster. every computer ive converted (3 at this point) runs so much faster on linux than windows. both x86 and x64.
2010-05-29T07:46:00.000Z	laplatadonna	Ken1	and yeah i was bored when i did mine, but it was worth the time. i wanted a mac but didnt have the money, and it turns out i found something better. :-) but one thing left is netflix...cant get it to run without virtualboxing windows. any luck?
2010-05-29T07:47:00.000Z	Ken1	laplatadonna	Very much so. I use only x86 but the boot time of my laptop is stupidly quick. I think I'm running in about 30 seconds from GRUB loading. I have a dual booting system with... ugh... Vista.
2010-05-29T07:49:00.000Z	laplatadonna	Ken1	I had a dual-boot for about ten minutes only because i wasnt sure how ubuntu would do with the new hardware but it was amazing.
2010-05-29T07:49:00.000Z	Ken1	laplatadonna	Have you tried WINE for Netflicks? I'm not sure Netflicks is exactly but maybe it'll help.
2010-05-29T07:50:00.000Z	laplatadonna	Ken1	ill meet you back in here as linux_is_my_hero, hold on.
