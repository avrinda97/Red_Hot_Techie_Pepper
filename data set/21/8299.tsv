2006-05-19T11:01:00.000Z	thomasM		hey guys, i need help changing the permissions of my njb mp3 player, but i don't know where/which file to chmod. Can somebody point me in the right direction?
2006-05-19T11:02:00.000Z	NoUse	thomasM	where is it mounted?
2006-05-19T11:03:00.000Z	NoUse	thomasM	when you plug in the device, run dmesg and see if it indicates where its located
2006-05-19T11:03:00.000Z	thomasM	NoUse	thankyou, one second
2006-05-19T11:05:00.000Z	thomasM	NoUse	usb 5-7: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 6
2006-05-19T11:06:00.000Z	NoUse	thomasM	anything else show up/
2006-05-19T11:06:00.000Z	thomasM	NoUse	did that help you?
2006-05-19T11:07:00.000Z	NoUse	thomasM	not really, did anything else get listed?
2006-05-19T11:07:00.000Z	thomasM	NoUse	um lots of stuff.
2006-05-19T11:07:00.000Z	NoUse	thomasM	pastebin it
2006-05-19T11:08:00.000Z	thomasM	NoUse	http://pastebin.com/717146
2006-05-19T11:10:00.000Z	NoUse	thomasM	what kind of permission issues are you having/
2006-05-19T11:11:00.000Z	thomasM	NoUse	i'm not sure, but i've been talking to the banshee guys, and they're telling me its permissions. It seems that in some circumstances writing to the player crashes banshee, while other times it doesn't.
2006-05-19T11:11:00.000Z	NoUse	thomasM	I've never used a njb so I'm not sure where its located
2006-05-19T11:11:00.000Z	thomasM	NoUse	gnomad2 has to be started as root to run correctly, also confirming the bad permissions idea.
2006-05-19T11:12:00.000Z	thomasM	NoUse	will it say in the device manager?
2006-05-19T11:12:00.000Z	NoUse	thomasM	possibly
2006-05-19T11:13:00.000Z	thomasM	NoUse	as in /sys/devices/
2006-05-19T11:13:00.000Z	thomasM	NoUse	say i find it. what do i do to change the permissions?
2006-05-19T11:14:00.000Z	NoUse	thomasM	it would be in /dev/ I think
2006-05-19T11:14:00.000Z	NoUse	thomasM	chown to change ownership, chmod to change permissions
