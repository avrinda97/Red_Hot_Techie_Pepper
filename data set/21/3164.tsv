2009-12-01T08:50:00.000Z	racecar56	kaski	is anything sucking your RAM?
2009-12-01T08:50:00.000Z	kaski	racecar56	I doubt it, I have 4 gbs
2009-12-01T08:51:00.000Z	racecar56	kaski	lucky you. i have 2gb and it's speeding fast already, in fact on my old comp with 512MB it speeds
2009-12-01T08:51:00.000Z	racecar56	kaski	...but it doesn't use ubuntu, it uses debian, but i'm trying to put ubuntu on it at the moment
2009-12-01T08:51:00.000Z	kaski	racecar56	i think it has something to do with it getting a conflicting IP or something
2009-12-01T08:51:00.000Z	racecar56	kaski	that *might* be possible, but unlikely.
2009-12-01T08:52:00.000Z	kaski	racecar56	also, i didnt have to set anything up for internet in ubuntu, it just fixed itself
2009-12-01T08:52:00.000Z	racecar56	kaski	that's fine.
2009-12-01T08:52:00.000Z	racecar56	kaski	my internet was auto-configured by ubuntu and it's fine
2009-12-01T08:53:00.000Z	kaski	racecar56	I would mess around with the settings but im not sure where to begin
2009-12-01T08:54:00.000Z	kaski	racecar56	could giving ubuntu its own static ip help?
2009-12-01T08:54:00.000Z	racecar56	kaski	maybe.
2009-12-01T08:54:00.000Z	racecar56	kaski	i think windows and ubuntu ARE using different IPs though. are they?
2009-12-01T08:54:00.000Z	kaski	racecar56	probably
2009-12-01T08:56:00.000Z	kaski	racecar56	the sad part is the canonical store selling software
2009-12-01T08:56:00.000Z	racecar56	kaski	yep.
2009-12-01T08:56:00.000Z	racecar56	kaski	you're right
2009-12-01T08:58:00.000Z	kaski	racecar56	if you already have the ubuntu iso can you tell wubi you have it so it doesnt have to torrent it?
