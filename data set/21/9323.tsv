2005-10-06T15:22:00.000Z	thompa	Seveas	the disks utility under the system menu should not let you mount it then. why is it there if it does not work?

2005-10-06T15:28:00.000Z	thompa	Seveas	where should i mount it root?
2005-10-06T15:28:00.000Z	Seveas	thompa	/media/windows or something
2005-10-06T15:30:00.000Z	thompa	Seveas	the disk manager allows you to add to any directory
