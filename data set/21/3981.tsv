2008-08-06T18:24:00.000Z	NDU		?
2008-08-06T18:24:00.000Z	NDU		DRBL?
2008-08-06T18:25:00.000Z	NDU		I'm having a problem with something called clonezilla, does anyone know about it?
2008-08-06T18:27:00.000Z	NDU		hello?
2008-08-06T18:28:00.000Z	Gnea	NDU	have you asked in #clonezilla?
2008-08-06T18:29:00.000Z	NDU	Gnea	no one is in that channel
2008-08-06T18:30:00.000Z	Gnea	NDU	well, clonezilla is offtopic here - are you trying to use it with ubuntu?
2008-08-06T18:30:00.000Z	Gnea	NDU	well, in order to help you, you'll need to provide a detailed explanation of your problem
2008-08-06T18:32:00.000Z	Gnea	NDU	that's not how it works here.
2008-08-06T18:33:00.000Z	Gnea	NDU	no problem. we prefer that you just come out with the problem because there are so many people in here
2008-08-06T18:36:00.000Z	Gnea	NDU	i'm wondering if we're talking about the same clonezilla - i'm thinking about the livecd that allows backing up and restoring of systems
2008-08-06T18:37:00.000Z	NDU	Gnea	Well, actually there are two, ones the live cd, ones an actual server that is a replacement for ghost
2008-08-06T18:38:00.000Z	Gnea	NDU	haven't heard of the second one. sounds confusing. is that made by the same people who did the livecd?
2008-08-06T18:38:00.000Z	NDU	Gnea	yeah
2008-08-06T18:39:00.000Z	Gnea	NDU	have you read this yet? http://www.clonezilla.org/forum/
2008-08-06T18:40:00.000Z	NDU	Gnea	yeah, if you click on the server forum, I'm specterm
2008-08-06T18:42:00.000Z	Gnea	NDU	well you've certainly made the right move there. your best bet is to wait for a response there or in #clonezilla
2008-08-06T18:43:00.000Z	NDU	Gnea	well, thanks =p
2008-08-06T18:43:00.000Z	Gnea	NDU	good luck.
