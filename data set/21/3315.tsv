2009-01-29T01:10:00.000Z	MasterJoker		Hola, #ubuntu. Wonderin if you can help me out with a noob problem.
2009-01-29T01:10:00.000Z	MasterJoker		>.>
2009-01-29T01:10:00.000Z	MasterJoker		That's redundant.
2009-01-29T01:10:00.000Z	MasterJoker		Anyway.
2009-01-29T01:11:00.000Z	MasterJoker		Is there a way to force Ubuntu to make the task bar flash when Pidgin has a new message? It did that in Fedora but I can't seem to get it to work in Ubuntu...
2009-01-29T01:12:00.000Z	MasterJoker		(running 8.10, by the way)
2009-01-29T01:12:00.000Z	zash	MasterJoker	sounds like a setting in pidgin?
2009-01-29T01:12:00.000Z	MasterJoker	zash	That's what I thought, but it's not
2009-01-29T01:13:00.000Z	zash	MasterJoker	are you running compiz?
2009-01-29T01:13:00.000Z	MasterJoker	zash	Yep. I can't find it in there either.
2009-01-29T01:14:00.000Z	zash	MasterJoker	"in there"
2009-01-29T01:14:00.000Z	MasterJoker	zash	in the Compiz Settings Manager
2009-01-29T01:15:00.000Z	zash	MasterJoker	the huge one?
2009-01-29T01:15:00.000Z	zash	MasterJoker	not the simple one
2009-01-29T01:15:00.000Z	MasterJoker	zash	um... the one under System>Preferences>CompizConfig Settings Manager
2009-01-29T01:16:00.000Z	MasterJoker	zash	don't know what one that is, tbh.
2009-01-29T01:16:00.000Z	zash	MasterJoker	CompizConfig Settings Manager = ccsm = the fat one with ALL options
2009-01-29T01:16:00.000Z	zash	MasterJoker	then there is ccsm-simple
2009-01-29T01:17:00.000Z	MasterJoker	zash	okay yeah then it's the fat one.
2009-01-29T01:20:00.000Z	zash	MasterJoker	try Configuration Editor (gconf-editor)
2009-01-29T01:21:00.000Z	zash	MasterJoker	and look in /apps/panel/ or something
