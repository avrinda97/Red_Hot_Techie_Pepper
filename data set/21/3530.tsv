2008-12-19T13:44:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	rob	hello. i might have an idea, but it's probably a no go for one reason or another
2008-12-19T13:44:00.000Z	rob		well ill try anything
2008-12-19T13:44:00.000Z	rob		-_-
2008-12-19T13:44:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	rob	i know the feeling. can you open stuff up in System --> Administration?
2008-12-19T13:44:00.000Z	rob		like... anything?
2008-12-19T13:45:00.000Z	rob		everything except time and date.. those are grayed out too
2008-12-19T13:45:00.000Z	rob		synaptic works fine
2008-12-19T13:45:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	rob	i System --> Administration -> Authorizations

2008-12-19T13:46:00.000Z	rob		the modify button inside authorizations is grayed so i cant make changes
2008-12-19T13:47:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	rob	roger.. it's a no-go
2008-12-19T13:47:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	rob	might check your sudoers file...
2008-12-19T13:47:00.000Z	rob		i thought about changing freedesktop - systemtoolbackends - manage system configuration but it wouldnt let me
