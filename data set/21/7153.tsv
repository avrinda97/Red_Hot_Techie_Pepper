2008-08-22T19:21:00.000Z	gunny		hello all, I have installed multiple video players (VLC, Mplayer, totem-xine, etc.) and the libdvdcss and the commercial DVD video I am trying to play breaks up and the picture appears to melt down upon trying to play it in all of theses, any suggestions?
2008-08-22T19:22:00.000Z	Slart	gunny	do you know if the dvd is alright? not scratched etc?
2008-08-22T19:22:00.000Z	Slart	gunny	it might be using some kind of weird windows only copying prevention too..
2008-08-22T19:24:00.000Z	Slart	gunny	try running the media player in a terminal and see what kind of error messages you get
2008-08-22T19:26:00.000Z	Slart	gunny	that would work
2008-08-22T19:31:00.000Z	gunny	Slart	It attempts to plat it and then give me: VLC media player 0.8.6e Janus Segmentation fault after bit rate, etc.
2008-08-22T19:31:00.000Z	Slart	gunny	oh.. try one of the other ones
2008-08-22T19:31:00.000Z	gunny	Slart	OK
2008-08-22T19:36:00.000Z	gunny	Slart	It give me the error: The source seems encrypted, and can't be read. Are you trying to play an encrypted DVD without libdvdcss?
2008-08-22T19:36:00.000Z	Slart	gunny	well.. is libdvdcss installed?
2008-08-22T19:36:00.000Z	gunny	Slart	yes
2008-08-22T19:38:00.000Z	Slart	gunny	well, it seems ubuntu can't read the contents of the dvd for some reason..
2008-08-22T19:39:00.000Z	gunny	Slart	hmmmm , let me try another DVD.
2008-08-22T19:49:00.000Z	gunny	Slart	Its playing Spiderman 3! Must be the first DVD was corrupted! Sorry! Thanks for your help. Looks like I will have to buy a new copy of the Bourne Ultimatum! (maybe a CIA plot.) VLC the best.
2008-08-22T19:50:00.000Z	gunny	Slart	I am a newie, what can I say?
2008-08-22T19:52:00.000Z	Slart	gunny	no worries.. it happens
2008-08-22T19:53:00.000Z	Slart	gunny	hope you can find a copy that works for you
2008-08-22T19:53:00.000Z	gunny	Slart	Thanks again for your help.
2008-08-22T19:54:00.000Z	gunny	Slart	By now I've got enough video players and Codecs installed to start my own movie studio...:-)
2008-08-22T19:55:00.000Z	Slart	gunny	hehe
2008-08-22T20:17:00.000Z	gunny	Slart	If you are still here, Geekbox played the DVD (Bourne Ultimatim)that I couldn't play on Ubuntu just fine...
