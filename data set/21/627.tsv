2011-08-23T04:33:00.000Z	conanbat		hey guys im having a desperate issue
2011-08-23T04:33:00.000Z	conanbat		I have windows 7 and installed ubuntu from there
2011-08-23T04:33:00.000Z	conanbat		this very morning ubuntu was running fine, but suddently, after a reboot, when ubuntu loads i get a gnu console
2011-08-23T04:33:00.000Z	conanbat		i have no idea what to do with that. Seems something broke. Windows 7 works perfectly fine, so i doubt some hardware issue
2011-08-23T04:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	conanbat	What prompt do you see from this "console"?
2011-08-23T04:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	conanbat	What version of Ubunut did you have installed?
2011-08-23T04:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	conanbat	Can you reboot to the grub shell and be on IRC at the same time from a different machine?
2011-08-23T04:38:00.000Z	conanbat	Jordan_U	unfortunately i cant
2011-08-23T04:39:00.000Z	conanbat	Jordan_U	but if i have to run a battery of commands or diagnostics, maybe we can make a list and i can try, and then come back
2011-08-23T04:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	conanbat	Can you boot from an Ubuntu LiveCD or USB?
2011-08-23T04:44:00.000Z	conanbat	Jordan_U	i just remembered that the last live cd i had, even if i found it, was like 9.10 or something, i've been updating it
2011-08-23T04:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	conanbat	If you could boot into Ubuntu then you could run boot info script.
2011-08-23T04:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	conanbat	No.
2011-08-23T04:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	conanbat	Do you have a camera that you can use to take pictures of the output at the grub shell (to avoid having to write and retype a lot of output)?
2011-08-23T04:51:00.000Z	conanbat	Jordan_U	will it help to install wubi?
2011-08-23T04:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	conanbat	You already have Wubi installed.
2011-08-23T04:59:00.000Z	conanbat	Jordan_U	yes but re-installing it. I would like to salvage the information, but more so having a version of ubuntu running as i depend on it to work
2011-08-23T05:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	conanbat	Boot into the grub shell and run "set", this will print the list of environment variables and thier values. Write down the value of the $prefix variable. Also run "ls" and write down all the output. If you see a grub version number on the screen somewhere write it down. Run "cat /boot/grub/grub.cfg". The last command will eithr print a short error message or flood your screen with output. Note which of the two it does.
2011-08-23T05:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	conanbat	One second.
2011-08-23T05:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	conanbat	If you need Ubuntu running soon and reliably then I would recommend burning an Ubuntu CD or making an Ubuntu USB and doing a normal (non-wubi) install. You can access your wubi files from the normal Ubuntu install.
2011-08-23T05:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	conanbat	That's all. I need to leave now, but I will be back in about 45 minutes.
