2007-10-23T01:46:00.000Z	MaJoRa		but i am struggling to see any benefit at all in upgrading
2007-10-23T01:47:00.000Z	stefg	MaJoRa	just feel l33t for being smart enough to hold a backup of your feisty install, and just forget about upgrading for a while. The gutsy kernel just doesn't work on your hardware it seems
2007-10-23T01:48:00.000Z	MaJoRa	stefg	but i no longer have the backup because the final install whiped it.... so i HAVE to use gutsy or its a waist of my time
2007-10-23T01:48:00.000Z	MaJoRa		lol
2007-10-23T01:49:00.000Z	stefg	MaJoRa	save your personal data and do a feisty reinstall....
