2007-09-05T12:43:00.000Z	labmicro4		hi all, i am installing an NIS client using Ubuntu, and this problem happen: YPBINDPROC_DOMAIN: Domain not bound
2007-09-05T12:43:00.000Z	ikonia	labmicro4	ok - your not bound to the domain - have you set the domain name ?
2007-09-05T12:44:00.000Z	labmicro4	ikonia	where i set ? i set the domain in yp.conf
2007-09-05T12:44:00.000Z	ikonia	labmicro4	do "domainname" see if its set
2007-09-05T12:45:00.000Z	ikonia	labmicro4	thats not what I said do
2007-09-05T12:45:00.000Z	ikonia	labmicro4	I said show me the output of domainname
2007-09-05T12:46:00.000Z	ikonia	labmicro4	ok - thats better
2007-09-05T12:48:00.000Z	labmicro4	ikonia	the server is in the same network. but someone told me that is necessary to register the client in the server. is it true ?
2007-09-05T12:48:00.000Z	ikonia	labmicro4	yes totally
2007-09-05T12:48:00.000Z	labmicro4	ikonia	how to register in the server ?
2007-09-05T12:48:00.000Z	ikonia	labmicro4	I'm a bit rusty but it is a command called "nis_client_setup" or smething like that
2007-09-05T12:49:00.000Z	ikonia	labmicro4	I'll see if I can dig it out
2007-09-05T13:15:00.000Z	labmicro4	ikonia	now i run rpcinfo -u labix ypserv
2007-09-05T13:15:00.000Z	labmicro4	ikonia	i try to run yptest
2007-09-05T13:16:00.000Z	ikonia	labmicro4	NICE find
2007-09-05T13:18:00.000Z	labmicro4	ikonia	an question, wih the rpcinfo, is the client registered in the server, or not yet ?
2007-09-05T13:18:00.000Z	ikonia	labmicro4	rpcinfo means the server responded to it, doesn't mean its registered as I remember
2007-09-05T13:19:00.000Z	labmicro4	ikonia	well, the answer was good :)
2007-09-05T13:19:00.000Z	ikonia	labmicro4	I'm rusty on legacy nis, so don't take what I say as fact
2007-09-05T13:20:00.000Z	labmicro4	ikonia	ok, but you are helping me a lot !!!!
2007-09-05T13:20:00.000Z	ikonia	labmicro4	if you can wait a few hours (big ask I know) I can sort you out properly when I get home to a nis box
