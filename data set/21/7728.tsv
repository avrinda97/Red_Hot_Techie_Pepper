2006-08-12T05:12:00.000Z	alienseer23		one of which being .wdb file compatability
2006-08-12T05:13:00.000Z	alienseer23		another being a nero like burning program, and another being something like alcohol or daemon (for emulation and virtual drive loading)
2006-08-12T05:14:00.000Z	alienseer23		I know I can use wine, but I would like to keep the windows programs away from my ubuntu install
2006-08-12T05:14:00.000Z	dougsko	alienseer23	one cool thing with linux is that you dont need something like daemon tools to mount a cd image, you can just mount it like any other drive
2006-08-12T05:15:00.000Z	alienseer23	dougsko	I can mount an image like a drive?!?! really!?!?!
2006-08-12T05:15:00.000Z	dougsko	alienseer23	yup
2006-08-12T05:16:00.000Z	dougsko	alienseer23	read the man page for mount
2006-08-12T05:18:00.000Z	alienseer23	dougsko	ok... sudo mount (filename).iso /media/iso     I have to add iso to my media folder, or will it do it automatically?
2006-08-12T05:19:00.000Z	dougsko	alienseer23	that will mount the disk to /media/iso
2006-08-12T05:19:00.000Z	dougsko	alienseer23	to do it automatically, add an entry to /etc/fstab
2006-08-12T05:19:00.000Z	dougsko	alienseer23	actually, dont do that, because that disk will proably not always be in the drive
2006-08-12T05:20:00.000Z	dougsko	alienseer23	just rin that mount command whenever you want to mount the disk. and make sure to do a "umount" before taking it out
2006-08-12T05:20:00.000Z	dougsko	alienseer23	that goes double for usb drives
2006-08-12T05:21:00.000Z	alienseer23	dougsko	so I don not need the -loop, or -t commands?
2006-08-12T05:21:00.000Z	alienseer23	dougsko	just a mount command at the iso file, aimed at media/iso ?
2006-08-12T05:21:00.000Z	dougsko	alienseer23	ive never used the -l switch, and you only need the -t switch is the regular mount command doesnt recognise the filesystem on its own
2006-08-12T05:24:00.000Z	alienseer23	dougsko	will other image files work for that, nrg, bin-cue, ect...
2006-08-12T05:25:00.000Z	dougsko	alienseer23	yeah
2006-08-12T05:26:00.000Z	alienseer23	dougsko	thanks for the good news, there. What about emulation for playing back-up images of gaims in cedega or thru wine?
2006-08-12T05:27:00.000Z	dougsko	alienseer23	i havent used ccedega, but ived used wine with limited success for random apps. its all a crapshoot really
2006-08-12T05:28:00.000Z	alienseer23	dougsko	ok
