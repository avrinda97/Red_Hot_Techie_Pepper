2008-05-04T02:02:00.000Z	graingert	cpare	should work fine
2008-05-04T02:02:00.000Z	graingert	cpare	I don't know what the problem is
2008-05-04T02:03:00.000Z	cpare	graingert	- I am now booting to low graphics mode
2008-05-04T02:03:00.000Z	cpare	graingert	- havce you ever seen that?
2008-05-04T02:03:00.000Z	graingert	cpare	no
2008-05-04T02:04:00.000Z	graingert	cpare	does a fresh install work?
2008-05-04T02:04:00.000Z	cpare	graingert	- thats my next stop
2008-05-04T02:04:00.000Z	cpare	graingert	-  however its a bit of a pita
2008-05-04T02:05:00.000Z	cpare	graingert	- as the 64bit cant mount my sata cdrom, so I have to rig a USB converter to it
2008-05-04T02:05:00.000Z	cpare	graingert	- :)
2008-05-04T02:05:00.000Z	cpare	graingert	- but then it works
2008-05-04T02:05:00.000Z	graingert	cpare	try sabayon that comes with the drivers installed, if that works then re-install ubuntu
