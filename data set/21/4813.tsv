2008-02-20T23:09:00.000Z	ahorriblemess		hello everyone
2008-02-20T23:10:00.000Z	ahorriblemess		I've downloaded and extracted a .tar.bz2 file, (MokoiGaming) but how do I install it? I tried "./configre ; make ; make install" but each of those commands come back with errors.
2008-02-20T23:10:00.000Z	ahorriblemess		I don't know my codes too well and I've been searching for answers on google and the forums for 2 hours
2008-02-20T23:10:00.000Z	ahorriblemess		ok, maybe 1 hour
2008-02-20T23:11:00.000Z	ahorriblemess		Drebellion: there's a readme in a subfolder, but it's empty
2008-02-20T23:12:00.000Z	ahorriblemess		how would I list the files through the terminal?
2008-02-20T23:12:00.000Z	ahorriblemess		Drebellion: sorry, how do I list the files in teh terminal
2008-02-20T23:12:00.000Z	gatestone	ahorriblemess	what's the first error ./configure gives?
2008-02-20T23:13:00.000Z	ahorriblemess	gatestone	bash ./configure No suck file or directory
2008-02-20T23:14:00.000Z	gatestone	ahorriblemess	you are trying too much. Check the games you can install with Synaptic first.
2008-02-20T23:16:00.000Z	gatestone	ahorriblemess	try "./linuxengine-bin"
2008-02-20T23:16:00.000Z	ahorriblemess	gatestone	ok
2008-02-20T23:17:00.000Z	ahorriblemess	gatestone	same thing
2008-02-20T23:21:00.000Z	ahorriblemess	gatestone	you too, thank you
2008-02-20T23:22:00.000Z	gatestone	ahorriblemess	seem like they have support forum at Mokoi Games...
2008-02-20T23:22:00.000Z	ahorriblemess	gatestone	they do, I might have followed the wrong link but there wasn't much on there... or it forwarded me to a list.php
2008-02-20T23:23:00.000Z	ahorriblemess	gatestone	but I will try again, thanks
2008-02-20T23:25:00.000Z	gatestone	ahorriblemess	I am trying Mokoi, downloading now
2008-02-20T23:25:00.000Z	ahorriblemess	gatestone	ok awesome, thanks
2008-02-20T23:39:00.000Z	gatestone	ahorriblemess	looks like you need various SDL etc.. libraries for Mokoi
2008-02-20T23:41:00.000Z	gatestone	ahorriblemess	install the requirements in https://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?group_id=173943&release_id=5679 and it works!
