2011-02-02T22:16:00.000Z	m_fulder	g_0_0	 sure that will do :P
2011-02-02T22:03:00.000Z	g_0_0	m_fulder	connect to webserver using address "localhost" or the internal ip address of you machine
2011-02-02T22:04:00.000Z	m_fulder	g_0_0	 but I need to connect by the external IP ... I have several servers on different networks and on my "old" network I can connect just fine to the webhost using the external IP
2011-02-02T22:06:00.000Z	g_0_0	m_fulder	use a proxy or 7
2011-02-02T22:06:00.000Z	m_fulder	g_0_0	 or 7? what do you mean exaclty? :)
2011-02-02T22:07:00.000Z	g_0_0	m_fulder	I mean use a proxy server to connect
2011-02-02T22:09:00.000Z	m_fulder	g_0_0	 it does work when I surf from a proxy server ... but I need this in an application ... can't I make my comp a proxy server ?
2011-02-02T22:10:00.000Z	g_0_0	m_fulder	what are you trying to do exactly ? which application?
2011-02-02T22:11:00.000Z	m_fulder	g_0_0	 its a ban-system for css-servers and while adding a server (which lays in the same network) it doesn't find it because it can't access the external IP ... same goes for mySQL connections ... I can't connect to my mySQL database while trying to connect with the external IP in my LAN
2011-02-02T22:13:00.000Z	g_0_0	m_fulder	are you using a domain name or the ip address?
2011-02-02T22:14:00.000Z	m_fulder	g_0_0	 the IP address
2011-02-02T22:15:00.000Z	g_0_0	m_fulder	why don't you just access it with the internal ip addr?
2011-02-02T22:17:00.000Z	m_fulder	g_0_0	but the only problem is ... I want the external IP to be shown on my "sourcebans" so players can connect to the servers from this site as well ... but while entering the internal IP sure the server willl be found but players can't connect via internal IP can't thay^^
2011-02-02T22:23:00.000Z	g_0_0	m_fulder	externally is your server resolve via a domain name or ip address?
2011-02-02T22:26:00.000Z	m_fulder	g_0_0	 my server is resolved by IP address
2011-02-02T22:30:00.000Z	m_fulder	g_0_0	 and sacarlson ..so you mean if I set up a domain name for my server I should be able to connect by my external IP = DN ?
2011-02-02T22:32:00.000Z	g_0_0	m_fulder	 if you setup a domain name - purchase a domain name - you can point it towards your external server ip addr, internally add the domain name to your /etc/hosts file with the internal ip addr and reference the server via its domain name
2011-02-03T00:46:00.000Z	m_fulder	g_0_0	 still here :) ... I've now set up a DN but still I can't connect ...also when I run traceroot I get only *** what does this mean?
2011-02-03T00:48:00.000Z	g_0_0	m_fulder	ok you set up a domain name, did you buy one?
2011-02-03T01:12:00.000Z	m_fulder	g_0_0	 yes my friend already had one he bought ..
2011-02-03T01:13:00.000Z	g_0_0	m_fulder	ok what service are you setting up
