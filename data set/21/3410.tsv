2012-06-16T20:45:00.000Z	axgb		i have managed to get to a command line, and i thought that another user may be able to tell me what to type into it to sort it out
2012-06-16T20:46:00.000Z	sacarlson	axgb	well the good thing is it's a desktop so maybe just move the disk to a system that has access and install fix it there?
2012-06-16T20:49:00.000Z	sacarlson	axgb	atheros is one of the best supported wifi suprized it won't work
2012-06-16T20:50:00.000Z	sacarlson	axgb	wifi encypted?   try wicd if you didn't already
2012-06-16T20:51:00.000Z	sacarlson	axgb	well if your the admin of the network you might want to temp decrypt the network till things work
2012-06-16T20:52:00.000Z	sacarlson	axgb	if the wire works then stick with that,  conectivity is important to help get things to work
2012-06-16T20:53:00.000Z	sacarlson	axgb	you stated the wire works?  so plug it in?
2012-06-16T20:56:00.000Z	sacarlson	axgb	sure you can reinstall with a live cd , just move your /home/* to  a usb and recover later
2012-06-16T20:57:00.000Z	sacarlson	axgb	if you spend more than 2 hours trying to fix many times faster to just reinstall if the install isn't what broke it to start
2012-06-16T20:58:00.000Z	sacarlson	axgb	 ya sometime when you remember to plug the power plug into the wall does it for me
2012-06-16T21:00:00.000Z	sacarlson	axgb	I failed to read you having any graphic problems but this time of night I miss many things
2012-06-16T21:21:00.000Z	sacarlson	axgb	with a reinstall?  you should delete any partitions you plan to use to install or ubuntu will be clueless what you want to use
