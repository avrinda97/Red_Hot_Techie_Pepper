2009-12-29T13:20:00.000Z	oettinger		depends on the size of your sd card
2009-12-29T13:20:00.000Z	oettinger		should do the trick
2009-12-29T13:20:00.000Z	oettinger		but that won't leave you a lot of room left
2009-12-29T13:20:00.000Z	oettinger		yes
2009-12-29T13:20:00.000Z	oettinger		no, sd-cards are pretty fast
2009-12-29T13:21:00.000Z	oettinger		yw
2009-12-29T13:22:00.000Z	oettinger		i'd say asus, but i'm a fanboy
2009-12-29T13:22:00.000Z	oettinger		ja das ist m√∂glich
2009-12-29T13:22:00.000Z	livingdaylite	oettinger	thank you
2009-12-29T13:22:00.000Z	livingdaylite	oettinger	this eeepc 701 is a little old now and the screen has black smudgings :(
2009-12-29T13:23:00.000Z	livingdaylite	oettinger	pfff... yes, but, takes away from viewing pleasure, especially for movies
2009-12-29T13:24:00.000Z	oettinger	livingdaylite	mmm, that's a bummer. but it's still usable for web browsing i guess?
2009-12-29T13:24:00.000Z	livingdaylite	oettinger	kind of .... shame it is out of guarantee... I don't know how it became like this
2009-12-29T13:25:00.000Z	livingdaylite	oettinger	i thought asus built it to last longer
2009-12-29T13:25:00.000Z	oettinger	livingdaylite	have you got the 2g or 4g version of the eee pc 701?
2009-12-29T13:25:00.000Z	livingdaylite	oettinger	hah, not even sure
2009-12-29T13:26:00.000Z	livingdaylite	oettinger	i still have the old xandros remix on it
2009-12-29T13:26:00.000Z	oettinger	livingdaylite	i got rid of the xandros remix just a few weeks after buying the eee pc, slow piece of junk it was :P
2009-12-29T13:27:00.000Z	oettinger	livingdaylite	i run a distro called crunchbang linux now, it's a stripped down version of ubuntu and it's blistering fast, even on my eee pc
2009-12-29T13:28:00.000Z	livingdaylite	oettinger	yea, this 701 is for my 7year old, so i need something easier than crunchbang
2009-12-29T13:29:00.000Z	oettinger	livingdaylite	in that case the netbook remix is a very easy distro. it's like the xandros distro with the 'retarded mode' on ;)
