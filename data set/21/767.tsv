2011-06-26T06:36:00.000Z	cyperbg		so after running sudo apt-get upgrade how can I confirm there are no more updates to install? Would doing sudo apt-get upgrade again install everything all over again?
2011-06-26T06:37:00.000Z	bazhang	cyperbg	no, it's set
2011-06-26T06:37:00.000Z	bazhang	cyperbg	safe bu t not needed
2011-06-26T06:51:00.000Z	bazhang	cyperbg	was it a kernel upgrade?
2011-06-26T06:51:00.000Z	cyperbg	bazhang	I'm not sure all I did was sudo apt-get update and then sudo apt-get upgrade
2011-06-26T06:52:00.000Z	bazhang	cyperbg	check right hand top corner does it say reboot to finish upgrade? or just the normal logout, shutdown etc
2011-06-26T06:53:00.000Z	cyperbg	bazhang	normal reboot/shut down
2011-06-26T06:53:00.000Z	bazhang	cyperbg	no need to reboot then
2011-06-26T06:59:00.000Z	bazhang	cyperbg	set it to blank
2011-06-26T06:59:00.000Z	cyperbg	bazhang	can you point me how?
2011-06-26T07:00:00.000Z	bazhang	cyperbg	for the keyring? is it already set with a password?
2011-06-26T07:01:00.000Z	cyperbg	bazhang	I think yes. Password and Encryption keys has one category - Password: Login with 2 entries: vino and Network secret for my wifi
2011-06-26T07:01:00.000Z	bazhang	cyperbg	system preferences passwords and encryption keys?
2011-06-26T07:02:00.000Z	cyperbg	bazhang	Yes
2011-06-30T09:52:00.000Z	bazhang	cyperbg	sudo apt-get install sensors-applet
2011-06-30T09:52:00.000Z	cyperbg	bazhang	yes but it doesn't show the Ati GPU temperatures if installed from the repos
2011-06-30T09:52:00.000Z	cyperbg	bazhang	it needs to be compiled manually for the Ati GPU temperatures to show
2011-06-30T09:53:00.000Z	bazhang	cyperbg	thats the same package. better to configure it to do so
2011-06-30T09:53:00.000Z	cyperbg	bazhang	I want to install it manually. Can you help?
2011-06-30T09:54:00.000Z	bazhang	cyperbg	I always use package manager for that
2011-06-30T09:54:00.000Z	cyperbg	bazhang	so you don't have any idea why it appears to be installed successfully but it doesn't show
