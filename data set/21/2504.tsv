2011-10-02T10:25:00.000Z	atom_		i have written programs but i cant get them to run
2011-10-02T10:26:00.000Z	atom_		just basic c programming, im starting to learn
2011-10-02T10:28:00.000Z	atom_		!soreau what code? the stuff form the terminal?
2011-10-02T10:30:00.000Z	atom_		i just saved it as a .c and dragged it to the terminal
2011-10-02T10:30:00.000Z	atom_		#include<stdio.h>
2011-10-02T10:30:00.000Z	atom_		main()

2011-10-02T10:30:00.000Z	atom_		}
2011-10-02T10:31:00.000Z	theadmin	atom_	No. gcc /path/to/file.c
2011-10-02T10:32:00.000Z	theadmin	atom_	You forgot the leading slash before /home
2011-10-02T10:33:00.000Z	theadmin	atom_	You messed something in there... Try this: gcc ~/tutorial1.c
2011-10-02T10:35:00.000Z	theadmin	atom_	Is the filename correct? "ElEpHanT" and "elephant" are different files.
2011-10-02T10:35:00.000Z	theadmin	atom_	gcc "~/C Tutorial 1.c"
2011-10-02T10:37:00.000Z	theadmin	atom_	Just make sure you type it right and the location is correct.
2011-10-02T10:41:00.000Z	theadmin	atom_	Well, it should have compiled.
2011-10-02T10:42:00.000Z	theadmin	atom_	There IS NO ERROR
2011-10-02T10:43:00.000Z	theadmin	atom_	It compiled just fine, it's not supposed to give any output
2011-10-02T10:43:00.000Z	theadmin	atom_	It just compiled, it's not supposed to run right away
2011-10-02T10:44:00.000Z	theadmin	atom_	I think the default filename is a.out, so just find that file and type the path to it. I have to go now.
