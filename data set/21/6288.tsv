2008-02-13T21:26:00.000Z	Solaris444		hi chaps.
2008-02-13T21:26:00.000Z	Solaris444		I'm dying here.
2008-02-13T21:26:00.000Z	Solaris444		I've been trying to get apache working for 4 hours.
2008-02-13T21:26:00.000Z	Solaris444		All i get is forbidden 403
2008-02-13T21:27:00.000Z	neverblue	Solaris444	which version of apache is installed?
2008-02-13T21:27:00.000Z	Solaris444	neverblue	2.2
2008-02-13T21:28:00.000Z	neverblue	Solaris444	ok, do you have anything inside /var/www ?
2008-02-13T21:28:00.000Z	neverblue	Solaris444	then, in your browser, do you enter the URL localhost?
2008-02-13T21:29:00.000Z	neverblue	Solaris444	possibly an index.html (in your /var/www) ?
2008-02-13T21:29:00.000Z	neverblue	Solaris444	try 'localhost' as the address
2008-02-13T21:29:00.000Z	neverblue	Solaris444	is there an index.html in the /var/www ?
2008-02-13T21:30:00.000Z	Solaris444	neverblue	there wasn't.  I added one.
2008-02-13T21:30:00.000Z	neverblue	Solaris444	ok, but there is... so enter localhost in your browser...
2008-02-13T21:31:00.000Z	neverblue	Solaris444	if you dont see the index.html page in /var/www, then confirm the service is running, sudo ps aux | grep apache
2008-02-13T21:39:00.000Z	neverblue	Solaris444	if you would just confirm what I asked, that would be great
2008-02-13T21:42:00.000Z	neverblue	Solaris444	i gave you the exact command to confirm if apache is running, why not use that, rather than your own assumptions?
2008-02-13T21:42:00.000Z	neverblue	Solaris444	sudo ps aux | grep apache
2008-02-13T21:44:00.000Z	neverblue	Solaris444	hows that coming along?
2008-02-13T21:49:00.000Z	Solaris444	neverblue	I get a couple of different processes.
2008-02-13T21:51:00.000Z	Solaris444	neverblue	http://localhost/ gives forbidden.
2008-02-13T21:54:00.000Z	Solaris444	neverblue	is that all the info you wanted?
