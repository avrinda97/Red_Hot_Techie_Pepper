2007-10-27T03:57:00.000Z	comicinker		my keyboard doesn't work in gnome apps anymore. can somebody help me?
2007-10-27T03:57:00.000Z	wildman	comicinker	can you redefine it using System->Preferences->Keyboard?
2007-10-27T03:59:00.000Z	comicinker	wildman	there is the correct keyboard layout set
2007-10-27T03:59:00.000Z	wildman	comicinker	redefine it anyway
2007-10-27T03:59:00.000Z	wildman	comicinker	after doing some X config wrong, I had to do that otherwise, no chance to have my keyboard working properly again...
2007-10-27T04:00:00.000Z	comicinker	wildman	I did it already yesterday ;)
2007-10-27T04:00:00.000Z	wildman	comicinker	sigh... no idea then, sorry.
2007-10-27T04:00:00.000Z	wildman	comicinker	euh... 1 idea: did you remove the checkmark from the use per-window settings? (or something like that)
2007-10-27T04:01:00.000Z	wildman	comicinker	per-window, per-app, cannot remember now
2007-10-27T04:01:00.000Z	comicinker	wildman	whats that?
2007-10-27T04:01:00.000Z	wildman	comicinker	wait, opening the applet
2007-10-27T04:02:00.000Z	comicinker	wildman	a more detailed desciption: I switched the system language from german to english, and the problem occur only to windows I switched back and for (either with alt-tab or mouse click) there are no problems in kde apps (amarok)
2007-10-27T04:02:00.000Z	wildman	comicinker	on the 2nd tab (Distribuciones in ES, I guess it's called Layout in EN) there's a checkmark called something like "separate group per window", did you try unchecking it?
2007-10-27T04:03:00.000Z	wildman	comicinker	maybe related to what I just wrote above...
2007-10-27T04:03:00.000Z	comicinker	wildman	 I see...
2007-10-27T04:04:00.000Z	comicinker	wildman	do I have to restart the X ?
2007-10-27T04:05:00.000Z	wildman	comicinker	cannot tell... I did.
2007-10-27T04:05:00.000Z	comicinker	wildman	I unchecked it now, but until now it had no effect.... I have a look to the other settings and try a restart now...
2007-10-27T04:06:00.000Z	wildman	comicinker	good luck
2007-10-27T04:16:00.000Z	comicinker	wildman	so after restart: the problem seems to be away now. thank you ;)
2007-10-27T04:16:00.000Z	wildman	comicinker	I was waiting for you to reconnect to ask. yw.
