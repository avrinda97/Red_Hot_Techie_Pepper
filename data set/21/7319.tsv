2006-12-02T08:28:00.000Z	DaGame		what's the way ubuntu updates?
2006-12-02T08:28:00.000Z	DaGame		I'm used to gentoo, no versions, everything just updates seperately starting at the bottom.
2006-12-02T08:28:00.000Z	DaGame		Can ubuntu do this?
2006-12-02T08:29:00.000Z	defrysk	DaGame	only with dist-upgrades
2006-12-02T08:29:00.000Z	DaGame		whats dist-upgrades?
2006-12-02T08:29:00.000Z	defrysk		from one release ti the next
2006-12-02T08:29:00.000Z	defrysk		to*
2006-12-02T08:33:00.000Z	defrysk	DaGame	also compare gentoo current with ubuntu-edgy in distrowatch.com, you'll see that ubuntu is not behind gentoo at all
2006-12-02T08:34:00.000Z	DaGame	defrysk	but when the next ubuntu version comes out... what do I do then?
2006-12-02T08:34:00.000Z	defrysk	DaGame	dist-upgrade or fresh install
2006-12-02T08:35:00.000Z	defrysk	DaGame	fresh install is usually best just make sure to back up
2006-12-02T08:35:00.000Z	defrysk	DaGame	and if you make a seperate /home you can backup all there :)
2006-12-02T08:36:00.000Z	defrysk	DaGame	backing up and fresh install takes less time then compiling firefox
2006-12-02T08:36:00.000Z	DaGame		What about all the apps and settings?
2006-12-02T08:36:00.000Z	DaGame		How does it know which apps to install?
2006-12-02T08:37:00.000Z	defrysk	DaGame	default settings are usually fine default install you can choose between kde gnome or xfce4 kubuntu , ubuntu, or xubuntu
2006-12-02T08:38:00.000Z	DaGame		what about all the apps I've installed after the OS.. how will it know which ones to download + install after the new clean install?
2006-12-02T08:39:00.000Z	defrysk	DaGame	there is a wiki , a help page and this irc channel in case of need
2006-12-02T08:39:00.000Z	DaGame		firefox, orphean ?
2006-12-02T08:40:00.000Z	defrysk	DaGame	just try ubuntu on a seperate partition first to test it and see if you like it and get the hang of it
2006-12-02T08:40:00.000Z	defrysk	DaGame	if you can run gentoo ubuntu should be a breeze
