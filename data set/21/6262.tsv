2007-06-06T11:01:00.000Z	neverblue2		how can I use my .bashrc (aliases/scripts) in an ssh session?
2007-06-06T11:02:00.000Z	Dr_willis	neverblue2	 when you login with ssh it should parse the .bashrc I think. It may be reading the .bash_profile instead
2007-06-06T11:02:00.000Z	neverblue2	Dr_willis	i dont have one, just .profile
2007-06-06T11:03:00.000Z	Dr_willis	neverblue2	 then make one. :)
2007-06-06T11:03:00.000Z	neverblue2		do I need to create a.bash_profile and reference the .bashrc?
