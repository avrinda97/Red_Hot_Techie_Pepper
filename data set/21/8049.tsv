2006-06-15T15:12:00.000Z	mitcheloc		hello, i'm trying to set up "monodevelop" on my ubuntu machine, it's hitting an impossible dependency... "monodevelop: Depends: monodoc-base (< 1.1.6) but1.1.13-0ubuntu1 is to be installed - E: Broken packages".... i tried googling but could not find any relevant information..... any ideas?
2006-06-15T15:13:00.000Z	Sivik	mitcheloc	did you installing the mono-base first?
2006-06-15T15:13:00.000Z	Sivik	mitcheloc	sudo apt-get install mono-base before trying to install via sudo apt-get install mono-develop
2006-06-15T15:13:00.000Z	mitcheloc	Sivik	"E: Couldn't find package mono-base"
2006-06-15T15:14:00.000Z	Sivik	mitcheloc	do apt-cache search mono and see if you see it there, if you don't, you don't have the correct repos yet
2006-06-15T15:14:00.000Z	mitcheloc	Sivik	not sure, i'm using kernel 2.6.15-25-386
2006-06-15T15:15:00.000Z	Sivik	mitcheloc	read the information about multiverse
2006-06-15T15:15:00.000Z	mitcheloc	Sivik	the only mono-base i see using apt-cache search mono is mono-assembiles-base
2006-06-15T15:15:00.000Z	Sivik	mitcheloc	ok, then you don't have the right repos yet
2006-06-15T15:16:00.000Z	Sivik	mitcheloc	do you have the multiverse enabled
2006-06-16T16:30:00.000Z	mitcheloc	Sivik	i'm about 95% sure i enabled the universe repo, and still no "mono-base" however i managed to get monodevelop installed, but it crashes on startup
2006-06-16T16:30:00.000Z	Sivik	mitcheloc	copy your sources.list to the pastebin and let me see it
2006-06-16T16:31:00.000Z	Sivik	mitcheloc	does that make sense?
2006-06-16T16:32:00.000Z	mitcheloc	Sivik	yes, here it is http://pastebin.com/pastebin.php?show=711764
2006-06-16T16:34:00.000Z	mitcheloc	Sivik	is it called mono-common maybe?
2006-06-16T16:34:00.000Z	Sivik	mitcheloc	you need the backports
2006-06-16T16:36:00.000Z	mitcheloc	Sivik	okay, trying now, just a sec
2006-06-16T16:36:00.000Z	Sivik	mitcheloc	see if that works, i think thats where the stuff is
2006-06-16T16:38:00.000Z	Sivik	mitcheloc	did that work
2006-06-16T16:38:00.000Z	Sivik	mitcheloc	try sudo apt-get install mono
2006-06-16T16:39:00.000Z	Sivik	mitcheloc	you may not even need the backports
