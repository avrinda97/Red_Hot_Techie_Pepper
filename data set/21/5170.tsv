2009-08-23T08:54:00.000Z	maco	soreau	intel's poulsbo graphics (found in some netbooks) use a different chipset than the rest. they hired an outside company to do drivers back on 2.6.24 (hardy days), but development ceased and current kernels dont work with it
2009-08-23T08:55:00.000Z	soreau	maco	I vaguely remember something about poulsbo.. something about them sucking ;)
2009-08-23T08:56:00.000Z	maco	soreau	on linux, yes, they do...thanks to half-arsed, unmaintained drivers
2009-11-29T13:35:00.000Z	maco	soreau	i dont think the D word is ok here
2009-11-29T13:36:00.000Z	soreau	maco	Probably not, but what can they do. Sue me?
2009-11-29T13:36:00.000Z	maco	soreau	ban you?
2009-11-29T13:37:00.000Z	soreau	maco	It wouldnt be a big loss for me anyway. I do 99% support, 0.9% BSing and 0.1% other
2009-11-29T13:37:00.000Z	maco	soreau	ok. im just trying to tell you that child-friendly language is a rule here
2009-11-29T13:38:00.000Z	soreau	maco	I'm well aware of the rules and I bend them sometimes
2011-02-13T11:54:00.000Z	maco	soreau	postinst scripts i think
2011-02-18T03:34:00.000Z	soreau	maco	papercut?
2011-02-18T03:36:00.000Z	maco	soreau	the Hundred Papercuts project is a project to fix small usability things that make using Ubuntu just a little less pleasant
2011-02-18T03:36:00.000Z	soreau	maco	Ah ok
2011-02-19T14:21:00.000Z	maco	soreau	if it's pygtk you're by definition using python
2011-02-19T14:21:00.000Z	soreau	maco	Sure but you can still do gtk gui programming with it, yes?
2011-02-19T14:22:00.000Z	maco	soreau	yes, but itd be a bit odd to mix the languages, unless you're about done and just want to optimise
2011-03-11T10:52:00.000Z	maco	soreau	language, please
2011-03-11T10:52:00.000Z	soreau	maco	right, I'm not in the best spirits tonight
2011-03-11T10:53:00.000Z	maco	soreau	how many buttons you wanna push?
2011-03-11T10:55:00.000Z	soreau	maco	I have 105 :P
