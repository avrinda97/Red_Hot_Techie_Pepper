2006-11-16T09:48:00.000Z	Jimbo		how do I install a program that is in .tar.gz form?
2006-11-16T09:49:00.000Z	Jimbo		new to linux here
2006-11-16T09:49:00.000Z	LjL	Jimbo	tar.gz is just a compression format
2006-11-16T09:49:00.000Z	LjL	Jimbo	then it depends on the program
2006-11-16T09:50:00.000Z	LjL	Jimbo	i meant it depends on the *specific* contents of the archive. it's like a .ZIP archive you can get on Windows -- there isn't a standard procedure for installing whatever is contained in it
2006-11-16T09:54:00.000Z	LjL	Jimbo	"make" is a command. "install" is a parameter for the command. you might consider checkinstall as well
2006-11-16T09:55:00.000Z	LjL	Jimbo	it will just run the "Makefile" file that it finds in the current directory
2006-11-16T09:56:00.000Z	LjL	Jimbo	it will just run the "Makefile" file that it finds in the current directory, which of course means that you must be in the right directory
2006-11-16T09:56:00.000Z	LjL	Jimbo	"make" is a command. "install" is a parameter for the command. you might consider checkinstall as well
2006-11-16T10:32:00.000Z	LjL	Jimbo	usually in a directory called like the .tar.gz file (except for the extension)
2006-11-17T09:53:00.000Z	LjL	Jimbo	yes, if you want to use auto-apt to help configuring. but then auto-apt will ask a lot of questions about packages to install, many of which you should answer NO to
2006-11-17T09:54:00.000Z	LjL	Jimbo	perhaps it would be better if you just went through the configure normally and used auto-apt or apt-file as a help when you're stuck
2006-11-17T09:58:00.000Z	Jimbo	LjL	 whats wrong with this   sudo auto-apt get install libpcre3-dev
