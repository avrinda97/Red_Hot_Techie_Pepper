2005-08-11T16:15:00.000Z	rapha		Is it possible to set a system-wide umask default for all users?
2005-08-11T16:15:00.000Z	Blissex	rapha	more or less, depends.
2005-08-11T16:15:00.000Z	rapha	Blissex	what is more and what is less? :-)
2005-08-11T16:15:00.000Z	Blissex	rapha	easiest way is to put some 'umask ...' line in the shared '/etc/profile.
2005-08-11T16:16:00.000Z	rapha	Blissex	Will that also be used by Nautilus and so on?
2005-08-11T16:16:00.000Z	Blissex	rapha	alternative, use the relevant PAM module (cant remember which one).
2005-08-11T16:16:00.000Z	Blissex	rapha	the 'umask' is injherited by all processes descended by the 'login' process.
2005-08-11T16:16:00.000Z	rapha	Blissex	okay, thanks
2005-08-11T16:19:00.000Z	rapha	Blissex	It appears the umask setting doesn't use the same (octal?) mask that chmod does. Where can I read up on how this one works, respectively, what would 660 be?
2005-08-11T16:20:00.000Z	Blissex	rapha	the 'umask' value is the _complement_ of the permnissions.
2005-08-11T16:23:00.000Z	Blissex	rapha	with 'umask' you cannot force permissions to be enabled, but you can only _disable_ them.
2005-08-11T16:24:00.000Z	rapha	Blissex	well, I want files by default to be zero for "other" and "whatever" for group and user
2005-08-11T16:24:00.000Z	Blissex	rapha	that would be 'umask 0007'
2005-08-11T16:25:00.000Z	Blissex	rapha	they could well be executable...
2005-08-11T16:27:00.000Z	rapha	Blissex	so where do I set umask for only a specific user?
2005-08-11T16:28:00.000Z	Blissex	rapha	in his own '~/.profile' or similar.
2005-08-11T16:28:00.000Z	rapha	Blissex	okay, thanks
2005-08-11T06:22:00.000Z	Blissex	rapha	that using 'breezy' is a very bad idea...
2005-08-11T06:22:00.000Z	rapha	Blissex	That's not very helpful, really...
2005-08-11T06:25:00.000Z	rapha	Blissex	No idea apart from that?
