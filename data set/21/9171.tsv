2007-09-29T16:46:00.000Z	peter_		hi i am very new to this os and i am confused as hell are there any dedicated rooms here where i can ask a few questions please?
2007-09-29T16:47:00.000Z	kevix	peter_	just ask the questions, providing as much info as you know like ubuntu version, hardware that is not working, what you last did...
2007-09-29T16:51:00.000Z	kevix	peter_	for all intent and purpose, there is no need to 'defarg' in linux.
2007-09-29T16:52:00.000Z	kevix	peter_	if you have the 'update-manager' installed, then it will show a 'orange blob' in your tool bar when you need to upgrade. click it, and it will do the upgrade.
2007-09-29T16:57:00.000Z	kevix	peter_	most software updates from time to time, but if you get something 'hot-off-the-press', it may have bugs, so it is best to get the version that is supported for your ubuntu release.
2007-09-29T16:58:00.000Z	kevix	peter_	one of the differences between Debian  and ubuntu is that ubuntu has a 6 month release cycle, so you get a reasonably up-to-date gnome.
2007-09-29T05:00:00.000Z	kevix	peter_	the release stable versions of Ubuntu every 6 months. you can stick with your version for about 1 year of official support or you can choose to upgrade to a new stable version.
2007-09-29T05:02:00.000Z	kevix	peter_	 gutsy gibbon (what I have) uses gnome 2.20.0
2007-09-29T05:04:00.000Z	kevix	peter_	the last 2 version of Ubuntu are fiesty fawn and gutsy gibbon (now in beta)
2007-09-29T05:11:00.000Z	kevix	peter_	type 'more /etc/lsb-release'
2007-09-29T05:16:00.000Z	kevix	peter_	did you include the ' (single quote)? if so, try with out them.
2007-09-29T05:18:00.000Z	kevix	peter_	 so you typed :        more /etc/lsb-release                  and no output?
2007-09-29T05:25:00.000Z	kevix	peter_	so what did it say?
2007-09-29T05:29:00.000Z	kevix	peter_	so you are using the last stable release = fiesty
2007-09-29T05:30:00.000Z	kevix	peter_	sure. I am running the next stable release,, now in beta, gutsy.
2007-09-29T05:32:00.000Z	kevix	peter_	 one of the wonders of Debian and its children is 'apt', it alone make upgrading your distro easy.
2007-09-29T05:34:00.000Z	kevix	peter_	is certainly better to have a firewall, but for the most part there is not linux 'virus' and if there was one, its not easy to catch.
2007-09-29T05:35:00.000Z	kevix	peter_	I like 'shorewall' but there are others.
2007-09-29T05:36:00.000Z	kevix	peter_	most folks who have DSL or cable, have a 'modem' that has a built-in firewall, at least some do, so that is some protection.
2007-09-29T05:37:00.000Z	kevix	peter_	 the 'application' menu has an option ''add/remove'. choose this to install software
2007-09-29T05:40:00.000Z	kevix	peter_	cheerio!
