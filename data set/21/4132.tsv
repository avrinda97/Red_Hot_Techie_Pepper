2009-05-11T05:16:00.000Z	JoshJ	jigp	you have at least one partition now... you can't not have a partition
2009-05-11T05:17:00.000Z	jigp	JoshJ	: so how to backup the chat logs then? :(
2009-05-11T05:17:00.000Z	JoshJ	jigp	stick them all in a folder, burn them to DVD
2009-05-11T05:18:00.000Z	JoshJ	jigp	dvd can be substituted for flash drive, whatever depending on how much space you have
2009-05-11T05:19:00.000Z	JoshJ	jigp	ah, i see
2009-05-11T05:19:00.000Z	JoshJ	jigp	you want to hit control-H in nautilus
2009-05-11T05:20:00.000Z	JoshJ	jigp	hidden files (aka "dotfiles") are commonly used for preferences and similar things for the sake of making browsing sane
2009-05-11T05:21:00.000Z	jigp	JoshJ	: im in File browser. all I see is bin/var/boot/cdrom etc..no pidgin
2009-05-11T05:21:00.000Z	JoshJ	jigp	you need to be in /home
2009-05-11T05:21:00.000Z	JoshJ	jigp	/home/jigp for instance
2009-05-11T05:22:00.000Z	jigp	JoshJ	: okay I am in /home/jigp and when I hit cntrl+h nothing happen
2009-05-11T05:22:00.000Z	JoshJ	jigp	where by "jigp" i mean your actual username on your computer
2009-05-11T05:22:00.000Z	jigp	JoshJ	yeah my actual account
2009-05-11T05:23:00.000Z	JoshJ	jigp	are you absolutely sure that you're in your home directory and you see things like Desktop and similar folders?
2009-05-11T05:25:00.000Z	jigp	JoshJ	: yah 100% sureness
2009-05-11T05:26:00.000Z	JoshJ	jigp	in Nautilus do view -> Show Hidden Files
2009-05-11T05:29:00.000Z	jigp	JoshJ	: I am in Dolphin and I don't see Nautilus there
2009-05-11T05:29:00.000Z	JoshJ	jigp	doh
2009-05-11T05:29:00.000Z	JoshJ	jigp	i assumed you were using nautilus since it's the default ubuntu file browser
2009-05-11T05:30:00.000Z	JoshJ	jigp	i imagine there's a way for Dolphin to show dotfiles as well
2009-05-11T05:35:00.000Z	jigp	JoshJ	ok I see hidden files now
