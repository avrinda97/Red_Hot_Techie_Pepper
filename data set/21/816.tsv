2011-08-18T21:27:00.000Z	selvakumaran	edbian	Pls give your comment on this
2011-08-18T21:27:00.000Z	edbian	selvakumaran	that looks good.  This isn't opensuse support though.  This is ubuntu so I can't comment.
2011-08-18T21:27:00.000Z	selvakumaran	edbian	ok., i can understand. but i want to be Ubuntu user so oly asked.
2011-08-18T21:28:00.000Z	edbian	selvakumaran	Well you need to use suse to solve a problem that suse caused.  I suggest you ask in #opensuse
2011-08-18T21:29:00.000Z	selvakumaran	edbian	i m moving because i could n't configure Aptana Studio in ubuntu. once i can able to work with those package then i'll be here.
2011-08-18T21:29:00.000Z	selvakumaran	edbian	Also Komodo EDIT
