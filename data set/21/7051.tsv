2006-12-08T10:12:00.000Z	xar0s	globe	plug the card in and go into device manager. then see what driver it loads, make sure you use THAT driver in ubuntu
2006-12-08T10:13:00.000Z	globe	xar0s	... well... that might not work. I am already on the wireless with a netgear pcmcia card on this windows box. the nix is a desktop

2006-12-08T10:22:00.000Z	xar0s	globe	has that card ever worked?
2006-12-08T10:23:00.000Z	xar0s	globe	ok... iwconfig didnt work... now try 'ifconfig'
2006-12-08T10:23:00.000Z	xar0s	globe	see what that reads out
2006-12-08T10:27:00.000Z	xar0s	globe	do you know your essid? is you go into the network moniter, then configure, then prefs for eth0, can you enter n essid?
