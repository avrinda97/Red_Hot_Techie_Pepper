2005-01-02T17:11:00.000Z	theNeonGod	ogra	running the ntp daemon from terminal within the desktop produces a 'can't find host start' error
2005-01-02T17:11:00.000Z	ogra	theNeonGod	ah, i thought you mean the startup
2005-01-02T17:11:00.000Z	theNeonGod	ogra	im assuming it failed there too. didn't notice.
2005-01-02T17:12:00.000Z	ogra	theNeonGod	it would show up red if it failed on boot
2005-01-02T17:12:00.000Z	theNeonGod	ogra	i kno
