2005-01-29T09:38:00.000Z	debiandemolition		would you like to answer a question, Pluk?
2005-01-29T09:38:00.000Z	debiandemolition		ok
2005-01-29T09:39:00.000Z	debiandemolition		I'm considering installing Ubuntu on a system with W2000 and Fedora1
2005-01-29T09:39:00.000Z	debiandemolition		getting rid of Fedora distro
2005-01-29T09:40:00.000Z	debiandemolition		I wonder if the Ubuntu installer is prepared for this :)
2005-01-29T09:40:00.000Z	ogra	debiandemolition	for nuking fedora ?
2005-01-29T09:41:00.000Z	ogra	debiandemolition	there is no special install option for that, but you certainly can do it :)
2005-01-29T09:41:00.000Z	ogra	debiandemolition	i.e. the "nukle other distros" button is missing
2005-01-29T09:42:00.000Z	ogra	debiandemolition	sometimes......
2005-01-29T09:43:00.000Z	ogra	debiandemolition	but easy solvable, there is a lwn article that is very helpful
2005-01-29T09:43:00.000Z	ogra	debiandemolition	have you had this prob in fc ?
2005-01-29T09:44:00.000Z	ogra	debiandemolition	then youll have it with warty too i guess....
2005-01-29T09:44:00.000Z	debiandemolition	ogra	ok, I will prepare for it then
2005-01-29T09:44:00.000Z	ogra	debiandemolition	nope, its just a grub fix....it isnt really damaged
2005-01-29T09:45:00.000Z	ogra	debiandemolition	you could also try to install one of the hoary/unstable CDs there it should be solved
2005-01-29T09:45:00.000Z	debiandemolition	ogra	I will consider that, thanks
2005-01-29T09:45:00.000Z	ogra	debiandemolition	but keep in mind that its the development version....even its in a freeze now and should get better daily
2005-01-29T09:47:00.000Z	debiandemolition	ogra	I read changing something in the bios circumvents it too, setting harddrive access to LBA or something ...
2005-01-29T09:47:00.000Z	ogra	debiandemolition	or from LBA to normal
2005-01-29T09:47:00.000Z	ogra	debiandemolition	one of these was the fix :)
