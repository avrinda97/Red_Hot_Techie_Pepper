2006-11-09T14:43:00.000Z	jake_		hi U all
2006-11-09T14:44:00.000Z	jake_		is someone copy-pasting something like binarydata?
2006-11-09T14:45:00.000Z	jake_		is it possible to ban that IP for some specified time or forever?
2006-11-09T14:45:00.000Z	jake_		no-one likes it
2006-11-09T14:46:00.000Z	jake_		oh... I'm sorry... I'm from Finland and I'm very very new(bie) Ubuntu user
2006-11-09T14:46:00.000Z	jake_		I started from Fedora Core 1 about 2 years ago
2006-11-09T14:48:00.000Z	jake_		first question: why my time is not updated from NTP server? I have to adjust time every boot up
2006-11-09T14:49:00.000Z	ofer0	jake_	try installing ntpdate. then use "sudo ntpdate 0.pool.ntp.org"
2006-11-09T14:52:00.000Z	jake_	ofer0	what should happen? I got a response like:  10 Nov 04:22:45 ntpdate[5564] : the NTP socket is in use, exiting
2006-11-09T14:53:00.000Z	ofer0	jake_	it means something isn't working correctly. you better investigate. netstat -antp
2006-11-09T14:53:00.000Z	ofer0	jake_	use sudo tzconfig
2006-11-09T14:57:00.000Z	jake_	ofer0	it seems that NTP server isn't workin' at all
2006-11-09T14:58:00.000Z	ofer0	jake_	that would be impossible, I just updated my time using it.
2006-11-09T14:58:00.000Z	ofer0	jake_	but you can try "ntpdate 1.pool.ntp.org
2006-11-09T14:58:00.000Z	jake_	ofer0	just something about gaim and this IRC Client
2006-11-09T14:58:00.000Z	ofer0	jake_	is it related to the NTP issue ?
2006-11-09T14:59:00.000Z	jake_	ofer0	I'm not sure - I'm still a newbie in Linux, even I have 2 years experience
2006-11-09T15:00:00.000Z	jake_	ofer0	anyway - Linux is my last OS - I will not return to Windows; if I don't have to :)
2006-11-09T15:00:00.000Z	ofer0	jake_	great :)
2006-11-09T15:00:00.000Z	jake_	ofer0	and I'm wondering... why I didn't start from ubuntu in first place; this distro seems be much better than FC
2006-11-09T15:02:00.000Z	jake_	ofer0	I'm now studying wine, but still something problems raises up
