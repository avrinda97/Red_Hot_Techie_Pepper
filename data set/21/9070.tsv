2005-11-18T10:45:00.000Z	bnD		" in ubuntu? trying to save iptables configuration
2005-11-18T10:45:00.000Z	trappist	bnD	that's all there is to it
2005-11-18T10:46:00.000Z	trappist	bnD	well, you'll need sudo
2005-11-18T10:46:00.000Z	bnD	trappist	didnt work
2005-11-18T10:46:00.000Z	trappist	bnD	you can put it anywhere you like (that exists) as long as you restore from the same place
2005-11-18T10:47:00.000Z	trappist	bnD	`which iptables`
2005-11-18T10:47:00.000Z	bnD	trappist	?
2005-11-18T10:47:00.000Z	trappist	bnD	run that command
2005-11-18T10:47:00.000Z	trappist	bnD	sudo
2005-11-18T10:48:00.000Z	bnD	trappist	brandon@edubuntu:~$ sudo iptables-save > /sbin/iptables
2005-11-18T10:48:00.000Z	trappist	bnD	don't do that!  you're trying to overwrite iptables itself.  put it somewhere else, like maybe root's home directory or /etc or something
2005-11-18T10:49:00.000Z	trappist	bnD	iptables-save > /etc/myrules for example
2005-11-18T10:49:00.000Z	trappist	bnD	no, you'd have to iptables-restore < /etc/myrules
2005-11-18T10:50:00.000Z	trappist	bnD	unless you have an iptables init script, in which case check it out to see where it tries to restore from
2005-11-18T10:50:00.000Z	trappist	bnD	try /etc/init.d/iptables save active
2005-11-18T10:51:00.000Z	bnD	trappist	it autoruns, however it isnt in init.d
2005-11-18T10:51:00.000Z	trappist	bnD	what autoruns?
2005-11-18T10:51:00.000Z	trappist	bnD	honestly I'm not on my ubuntu box atm so I'm not sure where else to look
2006-01-08T16:10:00.000Z	trappist	bnD	md5sum filename
2006-01-08T16:10:00.000Z	bnD	trappist	thanks
