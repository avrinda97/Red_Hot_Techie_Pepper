2007-03-30T06:12:00.000Z	Crazytom	dingdong	do you know what kind of chipset you have?
2007-03-30T06:13:00.000Z	Crazytom	dingdong	have you installed fwcutter?
2007-03-30T06:13:00.000Z	Crazytom	dingdong	what about ndiswrapper?
2007-03-30T06:15:00.000Z	Crazytom	dingdong	ok hold on you need fwcuttrer
2007-03-30T06:15:00.000Z	Crazytom	dingdong	go to the synaptic package manager
2007-03-30T06:15:00.000Z	Crazytom	dingdong	and search for fwcutter
2007-03-30T06:16:00.000Z	Crazytom	dingdong	when you install it be sure and look for the checkbox to download and install firmware or some such
2007-03-30T06:16:00.000Z	Crazytom	dingdong	yes install fwcutter
2007-03-30T06:17:00.000Z	Crazytom	dingdong	after that while you are going through the other boxes
2007-03-30T06:17:00.000Z	Crazytom	dingdong	yes
2007-03-30T06:18:00.000Z	Crazytom	dingdong	do you know what your interface is?
2007-03-30T06:19:00.000Z	Crazytom	dingdong	you could just try to configure it in the networking gui
2007-03-30T06:20:00.000Z	Crazytom	dingdong	you aren't using wep or anything?
2007-03-30T06:22:00.000Z	Crazytom	dingdong	if you're connected then you're set and it should work when you reboot you may want to consider setting up some type of security though.  like wep.
