2005-06-26T10:18:00.000Z	mne		hi there ! I'm using a debian base install, but the Xorg with all its dependencies is from ubuntu hoary which is the reason I came here. My problem is that the Xorg (the process Xorg) uses at least 245MB RAM, if Xorg runs for some time it even uses more than 350MB RAM. I have no explanation for the high memory usage since the same Xorg packages on my other boxes use about 40MB RAM. Any hints ? Could it be the graphic driver module (I
2005-06-26T10:18:00.000Z	mne		use nvidia) ?
2005-06-26T10:19:00.000Z	LinuxJones	mne	is your hard drive grinding away because of it ?
2005-06-26T10:19:00.000Z	mne	LinuxJones	yeah, sometimes it starts to swap since all my RAM (1GB) if full
2005-06-26T10:20:00.000Z	LinuxJones	mne	that's horrid, have you considered installing Ubuntu or reverting to xfree ?
2005-06-26T10:22:00.000Z	mne	LinuxJones	I used the same ubuntu package on my other debian machine where it just works fine. I guess it has something to do with the graphic driver module. I'm considering "upgrading" to ubuntu, unfortuately I currently have no time for it. (maybe in July)
2005-06-26T10:22:00.000Z	mne	LinuxJones	is there a way to debug the Xorg server ?
2005-06-26T10:22:00.000Z	LinuxJones	mne	it must be related in some way if that's the only difference, can you try using the vesa module to see if there is a change ?
2005-06-26T10:23:00.000Z	mne	LinuxJones	thats a good tip, I'll try it out. the funny thing is taht other people use the same nvidia kernel module and Xorg module and they don't have these problems ..
2005-06-26T10:24:00.000Z	LinuxJones	mne	I have a GF5200 and xorg is using about 40 MB of memory
2005-06-26T10:24:00.000Z	mne	LinuxJones	I'm trying the vesa module now, I'll tell you if it changes my situation when I'm done. thanks for helping
2005-06-26T10:24:00.000Z	LinuxJones	mne	GL :)
2005-06-26T10:25:00.000Z	mne	LinuxJones	thats the same on my other boxes, Xorg uses 40MB Ram there as well. just this box I'm currently sitting at has this problem. So till later ;)
2005-06-26T10:34:00.000Z	mne	LinuxJones	I just tried out vesa, it's still the same. pretty strange
2005-06-26T10:34:00.000Z	LinuxJones	mne	argh that sucks :(
2005-06-26T10:35:00.000Z	LinuxJones	mne	did you re-boot ?
2005-06-26T10:35:00.000Z	mne	LinuxJones	yes, I did that too
2005-06-26T10:37:00.000Z	mne	LinuxJones	it there another way to have a look at which processes use how much memory ? I use top
2005-06-26T10:38:00.000Z	LinuxJones	mne	ps -aux but I think top uses that neways
2005-06-26T10:39:00.000Z	mne	LinuxJones	unfortunaely ps -aux shown me the percentage of memory a process uses only. not the actual size in mb
2005-06-26T10:40:00.000Z	mne	LinuxJones	so anyway, thanks for helping, I have to get back to work. At least I know now that the problem isn't the nvidia driver module.
