Please check your BIOS settings, or for more information, run:  /usr/bin/check-bios-nx --verbose" and "System information disabled due to load higher than 1" what's this?

2010-12-20T18:09:00.000Z	Darael	bezao	Looks like something unexpected is happening with your CPU.  Can you run and pastebin the output of the suggested command?
2010-12-20T18:12:00.000Z	bezao	Darael	yes, 1 min pls
2010-12-20T18:13:00.000Z	bezao	Darael	here http://paste.ubuntu.com/545946/
2010-12-20T18:13:00.000Z	bezao	Darael	i'm running ubuntu on vbox, my primary OS is win7
2010-12-20T18:14:00.000Z	Darael	bezao	Right.  Looks like there's a CPU feature that Ubuntu is expecting but is disabled in your BIOS.  Ideally, you want to enable it in your vbox BIOS.  On the other hand, you could install the linux-virtual package and remove the linux-generic package and see if it helps.
2010-12-20T18:15:00.000Z	bezao	Darael	if i keep this way, it will give me some problem?
2010-12-20T18:17:00.000Z	Darael	bezao	I don't know myself, but Ubuntu doesn't generally complain unless it might.  Looking at the wiki page referenced, it could be a security hole.
2010-12-20T18:18:00.000Z	bezao	Darael	ok, thanks, i'll try fix it :)
2010-12-20T18:42:00.000Z	bezao	Darael	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1517551 i did not understood, what he 'turned on'? lol
2010-12-20T18:48:00.000Z	Darael	bezao	Sorry, one moment, I'll have a look.
2010-12-20T18:48:00.000Z	bezao	Darael	ok, noproblem
2010-12-20T18:50:00.000Z	Darael	bezao	You need to go into the bios for the host and check that any virtualisation options are enabled, and into the virtual bios for the guest and check that NX is enabled.
2010-12-20T18:50:00.000Z	bezao	Darael	you mean the bios of the real cpu, not a bios on the virtualbox?
2010-12-20T18:51:00.000Z	Darael	bezao	That for the host, and the NX in the virtualbox bios.
2010-12-20T18:51:00.000Z	bezao	Darael	ok, understood, i'll try thanks
2010-12-21T02:51:00.000Z	Darael	bezao	What do you mean?  To run .exe files, you'll most often want Wine, or its frontend PlayOnLinux.
2010-12-21T02:53:00.000Z	Darael	bezao	For future reference, you can do !br | nick (or another language code) and the bot'll give a nice response for them.
2010-12-21T02:54:00.000Z	bezao	Darael	sorry
2010-12-21T02:54:00.000Z	Darael	bezao	It's not a problem, it was meant as a little bit of info you might find useful!
