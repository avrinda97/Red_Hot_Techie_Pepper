2006-05-31T07:54:00.000Z	Okita		I'm dual-booting and Windows wrecked my MBR... how can I get the nice bootloader Dapper installed for me back?
2006-05-31T07:55:00.000Z	Okita		Hopefully I won't need to redo the grub.conf or whatever?

2006-05-31T08:01:00.000Z	Okita	nickrud	Thanks, wrestling with grub now =)
2006-05-31T08:30:00.000Z	nickrud	Okita	I wasn't really following, but that wiki page should allow you to recreate the proper boot for ubuntu. What's the issue?
2006-05-31T08:32:00.000Z	Okita	nickrud	I followed those instructions, but grub and grub-install gave me various errors, and I may have stepped a little too far into the install script, and I'm afraid it may have erased the Linux install on my original partition
2006-05-31T08:32:00.000Z	nickrud	Okita	ouch.
2006-05-31T08:32:00.000Z	Okita	nickrud	I guess the good news is that I only did the install day before yesterday
2006-05-31T08:32:00.000Z	nickrud	Okita	yeah, that is gooooood news :)
2006-05-31T08:33:00.000Z	Okita	nickrud	I'm fscking it now just in case, but anyways, it's weird that grub didn't want to run any of the commands on that page you gave me
2006-05-31T08:34:00.000Z	nickrud	Okita	hrm. Me, I don't run windows, so I point people at that page because it seems to work.
2006-05-31T08:37:00.000Z	Okita	nickrud	Doesn't grub need a config file of some kind?
2006-05-31T08:38:00.000Z	Okita	nickrud	Ahh, I've my old partition back... Now I can go into the /boot directory and use the menu.lst that's there?
2006-05-31T08:41:00.000Z	nickrud	Okita	if it's properly made, and referenced propery by update-grub & grub-install, of course :)
2006-05-31T08:41:00.000Z	Okita	nickrud	Well, the one from my previously working Kubuntu partition should be good =)
2006-05-31T08:42:00.000Z	nickrud	Okita	check it carefully.
2006-05-31T08:42:00.000Z	Okita	nickrud	Whoops, now I have two bootloaders
2006-05-31T08:42:00.000Z	Okita	nickrud	The pretty Kubuntu one and the plain grub one
2006-05-31T08:43:00.000Z	nickrud	Okita	I try to know as little about grub as needed.
2006-05-31T08:43:00.000Z	Okita	nickrud	Knowing how to use grub is like knowing where your fire extinguisher is... Usually doesn't seem like useful knowledge until you need it
2006-05-31T08:46:00.000Z	nickrud	Okita	I bring out lilo when I need the fire extinguisher :)
