2005-12-30T17:54:00.000Z	toya__		for mounting ntfs in fstab do i put 222 or 000 for umask?
2005-12-30T17:54:00.000Z	ssstormy	toya__	put umask=0222
2005-12-30T17:54:00.000Z	toya__	ssstormy	ok i'll try, because last time i put 222 it screws up
2005-12-30T17:55:00.000Z	toya__	ssstormy	and its working fine with 000 now
2005-12-30T17:55:00.000Z	ssstormy	toya__	I use 000 too but the help manual said use 0222
2005-12-30T17:55:00.000Z	toya__	ssstormy	ok ic
2005-12-30T17:56:00.000Z	ssstormy	toya__	gaim will auto start if it was open when you last shut down
2005-12-30T17:56:00.000Z	toya__	ssstormy	just set it to rw i guess
2005-12-30T17:56:00.000Z	toya__	ssstormy	but writing to ntfs is not safe
2005-12-30T17:56:00.000Z	ssstormy	toya__	no you can't write to ntfs period
2005-12-30T17:56:00.000Z	toya__	ssstormy	you can but it might screw the partition up
2005-12-30T17:57:00.000Z	ssstormy	toya__	you can?  how do you force it?
2005-12-30T17:57:00.000Z	toya__	ssstormy	no i dont save sessions when i shut down
2005-12-30T17:57:00.000Z	toya__	ssstormy	i highly disrecommend it (is that a word)?
2005-12-30T17:57:00.000Z	toya__	ssstormy	just make it to rw
2005-12-30T17:57:00.000Z	ssstormy	toya__	does that actually work?
2005-12-30T17:57:00.000Z	toya__	ssstormy	never tried, not sure
2005-12-30T06:01:00.000Z	ssstormy	toya__	extra junk
2005-12-30T06:09:00.000Z	ssstormy	toya__	I think it is the other way round
2005-12-30T06:09:00.000Z	toya__	ssstormy	when you load up originally i think first it loads metacity, then some program, then the panel
2005-12-30T06:09:00.000Z	ssstormy	toya__	oops nevermind; yeah I think gnomepanel runs off metacity
