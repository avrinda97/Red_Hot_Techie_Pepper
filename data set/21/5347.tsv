2007-12-05T23:33:00.000Z	dlocaus		hello!
2007-12-05T23:34:00.000Z	dlocaus		does anyone know how to recover a file from a harddrive that isn't mountable? (the start of the harddrive is fubar)?
2007-12-05T23:36:00.000Z	Thurin1	dlocaus	Your bios refuses to see the disk sometimes?
2007-12-05T23:36:00.000Z	dlocaus	Thurin1	yes.
2007-12-05T23:36:00.000Z	Thurin1	dlocaus	I'd start backing up - sounds to me like a drive on the way out.
2007-12-05T23:37:00.000Z	dlocaus	Thurin1	a bit passed that point... :), I can't even boot or mount it.
2007-12-05T23:37:00.000Z	Thurin1	dlocaus	:| Oh noes! :|
2007-12-05T23:38:00.000Z	Thurin1	dlocaus	Hrmm, you know what you should do? last ditch effort? - try to 'mount' it .. in Windows with the EXT3 driver... you might be able to save .. some data maybe
2007-12-05T23:38:00.000Z	dlocaus	Thurin1	Is there some program that will read the harddisk in block mode and try and figure ou the OS from there?
2007-12-05T23:38:00.000Z	dlocaus	Thurin1	sorry, figure out the files from there?
2007-12-05T23:38:00.000Z	Thurin1	dlocaus	Yes and no.. there is yes, but they are highly experimental and .. could damage whatever data you have on the disk
2007-12-05T23:38:00.000Z	dlocaus	Thurin1	I hadn't thought of that, I'll check around for windows EXT3 driver
2007-12-05T23:39:00.000Z	Thurin1	dlocaus	Well there is a drive for windows which allows the mounting of EXT3 disks - since windows has so much less 'requirements' for a 'good' disk - you may be able to see inside it and save what you need from it.
2007-12-05T23:40:00.000Z	dlocaus	Thurin1	do you know of any programs that will look at a harddisk as a device to read, instead of a storage mechanisem to mount?
2007-12-05T23:40:00.000Z	Thurin1	dlocaus	;) yeah give it a shot.. windows like I said is not as strict as what is a 'good' or 'bad' disk - but if EXT3 driver and windows can't do it .. i'm afraid your disk is beyond hope.. unless you go to a real pro at data recovery I guess
2007-12-05T23:40:00.000Z	Thurin1	dlocaus	Heh.. windows
2007-12-05T23:42:00.000Z	Thurin1	dlocaus	Linux is picky you see
2007-12-05T23:45:00.000Z	dlocaus	Thurin1	thank you too, but I've gone to USB thumb drives, those 1G SD cards are really cheap now... :)
2007-12-05T23:45:00.000Z	Thurin1	dlocaus	This is true this is true - but I still dont trust them lol haha. -- Personal taste :P
2007-12-05T23:46:00.000Z	dlocaus	Thurin1	I don't trust them either, I've heard of lots of failures.  However, I doubt they will both fail at the same time.
2007-12-05T23:46:00.000Z	Thurin1	dlocaus	I sure hope not... :|
