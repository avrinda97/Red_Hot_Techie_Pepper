2007-10-21T01:09:00.000Z	Andycasss		is there a way to automount samba when the destination is not reachable (use repeat with delay)?
2007-10-21T01:10:00.000Z	usser	Andycasss	write a script
2007-10-21T01:11:00.000Z	usser	Andycasss	what are u trying to do?
2007-10-21T01:13:00.000Z	usser	Andycasss	sorry im not registered so i cant pm
2007-10-21T01:13:00.000Z	usser	Andycasss	pretty much the same goes for linux
2007-10-21T01:17:00.000Z	usser	Andycasss	u still here
2007-10-21T01:17:00.000Z	usser	Andycasss	the script would look something like this
2007-10-21T01:18:00.000Z	usser	Andycasss	hang on i'll pastebin it
2007-10-21T01:21:00.000Z	usser	Andycasss	heres the link to script http://pastebin.ca/743837
2007-10-21T01:24:00.000Z	usser	Andycasss	its just that u'll have to have smbfs installed
2007-10-21T01:24:00.000Z	usser	Andycasss	and change the server name and mount point accordingly
2007-10-21T01:27:00.000Z	usser	Andycasss	and then if u want the script to run at startup just put it into /usr/share/autostart
2007-10-21T01:29:00.000Z	usser	Andycasss	no this line checks if the smbmount suceeded
2007-10-21T01:29:00.000Z	usser	Andycasss	leave it as is
2007-10-21T01:30:00.000Z	usser	Andycasss	oh if u want the script to try mounting in some sort of interval put sleep <num of seconds> the first line inside the while loop
2007-10-21T01:31:00.000Z	usser	Andycasss	/j #usser
2007-10-21T01:34:00.000Z	usser	Andycasss	i may be its blocked by firewall or u are trying to mount it to the root partition to which you dont have writing permissions
2007-10-21T01:34:00.000Z	usser	Andycasss	join #usser
2007-10-21T02:17:00.000Z	usser	Andycasss	btw i messed it up /usr/share/autostart only accepts files in .desktop format
2007-10-21T02:24:00.000Z	usser	Andycasss	yea sure join #usser
2007-12-01T03:03:00.000Z	usser	Andycasss	this is not a good idea
