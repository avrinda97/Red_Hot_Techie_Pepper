2009-08-22T11:46:00.000Z	spO		i have multiple rar files in one directory,  i try rar e *.rar   , but it does nto extract anything,  it works if i do rar e fullrarname.rar  , but not *.rar
2009-08-22T11:47:00.000Z	spO		i gues si will use find langauge again
2009-08-22T11:48:00.000Z	spO		okay thanks
2009-08-22T11:49:00.000Z	spO		boohab, that is C language or bash?
2009-08-22T11:50:00.000Z	kevdog	spO	bash
2009-08-22T11:51:00.000Z	spO		my other problem is that i cannot save dvdrebuilder project files under wine, but i guess there is no way aroudn that, so i have to use that program with windows or backup dvds one at a time
2009-08-22T11:51:00.000Z	spO		it gives me this error when trying to save project files:  rr:seh:setup_exception_record stack overflow 1324 bytes in thread 0009 eip 7bc3c7de esp 00230e04 stack 0x230000-0x231000-0x330000
2009-08-22T11:53:00.000Z	spO		johnneylee, dvdrebuilder   re-encodes dvd9 dvds to dvd5   by using CCE ... the best quality encoder currently
2009-08-22T11:55:00.000Z	kevdog	spO	isnt CCE not free?
2009-08-22T11:56:00.000Z	spO		cce is not free, no
2009-08-22T11:57:00.000Z	spO		i could notice a major difference between cce encoding/dvdrebuilder and   plain old dvdshrink, and i reckon   k9copy and dvd95 are similar to dvdshrink
2009-08-22T11:58:00.000Z	kevdog	spO	don't like dvdshrink?
2009-08-22T11:58:00.000Z	spO		dvdshrink is nice but it gives very poor quality video
2009-08-22T11:59:00.000Z	kevdog	spO	What's the proposed alternative -- I really didn't know there was one.  I use DVDShrink a lot -- maybe b/c its very easy :)
2009-08-22T12:01:00.000Z	kevdog		I'm open to any alternative to dvdshrink -- however buying the CCE -- very expensive for me
2009-08-22T12:01:00.000Z	spO	kevdog	  dvdrebuilder with CCE is the best quality
2009-08-22T12:01:00.000Z	kevdog	spO	How much did the CCE run you?
2009-08-22T12:02:00.000Z	spO		i am running the trial edition
2009-08-22T12:02:00.000Z	kevdog	spO	Doesn't trial edition have some limitations or time limit?  I thought to purchase the CCE it was like $1K
2009-08-22T12:04:00.000Z	spO	kevdog	i don't talk about piracy or support of it
2009-08-22T12:04:00.000Z	kevdog	spO	I'm not talking about piracy -- far from it -- I guess I just asked how much the CCE was going to run?  Not sure how that relates to piracy??
