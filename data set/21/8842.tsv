2006-06-07T07:37:00.000Z	asdx		ok, whatever
2006-06-07T07:38:00.000Z	asdx		I need another burner software for windows, is there some free burner that also support widnows?
2006-06-07T07:39:00.000Z	asdx		FUCK
2006-06-07T07:39:00.000Z	krazykit	asdx	language.  and use the nero trial
2006-06-07T10:58:00.000Z	krazykit	asdx	wifi stack?  maybe. initng?  doubt it.  aiglx?  probably not.  xgl/compiz by default?  unlikely.  kde4?  dpends on when it releases.
2006-06-07T10:58:00.000Z	asdx	krazykit	why aiglx probably not?
2006-06-07T10:58:00.000Z	asdx	krazykit	is what everyone will be using
2006-06-07T10:59:00.000Z	krazykit	asdx	as far as i know neither ati nor nvidia have released aiglx compatible drivers, unless i'm thinking of egl or something
2006-06-07T10:59:00.000Z	asdx	krazykit	nvidia will release their next driver with aiglx support
2006-06-07T10:59:00.000Z	asdx	krazykit	and aiglx is on xorg already
2006-06-07T10:59:00.000Z	asdx	krazykit	merged or something
2006-06-07T11:04:00.000Z	krazykit	asdx	i think gnome should dump metacity.
2006-06-07T11:07:00.000Z	krazykit	asdx	give microsoft a ring and tell them to "open up" ;-)
2006-06-07T11:07:00.000Z	asdx	krazykit	lol
