2012-05-18T14:24:00.000Z	WotWhere		new AMD System build. Cannot get Ubuntu 12.04 to work
2012-05-18T14:24:00.000Z	ikonia	WotWhere	define can't get it to work
2012-05-18T14:24:00.000Z	ikonia	WotWhere	or I can only say "fix it"
2012-05-18T14:26:00.000Z	WotWhere	ikonia	the system boots up.. but no Sound or video playing.. hangs when i try to play anything.. SegvFaults
2012-05-18T14:26:00.000Z	ikonia	WotWhere	so you can boot the system and use it fine, but when you try to play a video you get no sound and it segfaults
2012-05-18T14:29:00.000Z	WotWhere	ikonia	thats right.. but there are other issues also.. ex. on starting Allsettings ---> additional drivers .. i get internal errors SegvFaults.. (which have been reported)
2012-05-18T14:29:00.000Z	ikonia	WotWhere	segfaults normally = hardware problems, which in your case I'd suggest memory / cpu problems
2012-05-18T14:29:00.000Z	ikonia	WotWhere	I'd run memcheck to do some tests
2012-05-18T14:32:00.000Z	WotWhere	ikonia	its  a brand new system, also win7 works fine.. but will try ur way have run out of options been googling Ubuntu and found it has issues with propreitory drivers
2012-05-18T14:32:00.000Z	ikonia	WotWhere	windows working fine is not a valid test, brand new does not mean it is in full working order
2012-05-18T14:33:00.000Z	ikonia	WotWhere	there are possible issues with propritary drivers, disable them and see if the problem goes away
2012-05-18T14:34:00.000Z	WotWhere	ikonia	have tried that this is my 3rd day of troubleshooting,  Xdiagnostics error BUG: unable to handle NULL Pointer dereference at 00..02c
2012-05-18T14:35:00.000Z	ikonia	WotWhere	no point putting random lines like that, they mean nothing in context
2012-05-18T14:36:00.000Z	ikonia	WotWhere	so if you've disabled the propritary drivers and it's still doing it.....it won't be them
2012-05-18T14:36:00.000Z	ikonia	WotWhere	which leads it back to a base hardware issue as the most likley cause (from experience)
2012-05-18T14:36:00.000Z	WotWhere	ikonia	ok ... doing the memtest right now
2012-05-18T14:36:00.000Z	ikonia	WotWhere	make sure you leave it running for 24 hours or so
2012-05-18T14:43:00.000Z	WotWhere	ikonia	When i did a fresh install the System was Freezing all the time.. then I installed AMD Catalyst 12.4 Manually.. i dont think the memtest will help at all.. doing it coz havent done as yet
2012-05-18T14:47:00.000Z	WotWhere	ikonia	AMD 8120 + msi 990fxa mobo + corsair 1600 8gb + WD 500 .. the mobo has Realtek HD Audio + Gigabyte HD7770OC.. if that has any meaning
2012-05-18T14:47:00.000Z	ikonia	WotWhere	none
2012-05-18T23:12:00.000Z	WotWhere	ikonia	u there?
