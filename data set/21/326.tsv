2012-03-01T15:15:00.000Z	sharpK		actionparsnip, possibly, but speaking of the devil, I just booted into unity, an error that goes below the screen (can't press close) with all the "trying mode resolutionxresolution pass 0 failures", the system is haning and I can see the mouse move but can't do anything...
2012-03-01T15:15:00.000Z	n00gie	sharpK	you need to use nvidia's tool for multi-monitor setup
2012-03-01T15:16:00.000Z	n00gie	sharpK	what error messages did you get?
2012-03-01T15:16:00.000Z	sharpK	n00gie	that's what I am using and got the error....
2012-03-01T15:17:00.000Z	sharpK	n00gie	could not apply the stored configurtion for monitors none of the selected modes were compatible with the possible modes: trying modes for CRTC 354: and then a humongous list that goes off screen of different resolutions and hertz....
2012-03-01T15:17:00.000Z	n00gie	sharpK	what monitors and what kind of connection are you using?
2012-03-01T15:18:00.000Z	sharpK	n00gie	one is an LCD (vga I think), and the other is a panasonic tv (hdmi)...
2012-03-01T15:19:00.000Z	n00gie	sharpK	what resolutions do they support?
2012-03-01T15:19:00.000Z	n00gie	sharpK	sometimes TVs lie about being 1080p.
2012-03-01T15:20:00.000Z	sharpK	n00gie	I am pretty sure standard resolutions for the lcd (can't recall exactly) and the tv is 1080p (worked with windows, at least)
2012-03-01T15:20:00.000Z	n00gie	sharpK	what resolutions did you try to assign to each of the displays?
2012-03-01T15:20:00.000Z	n00gie	sharpK	there is no standard resolution for lcd.
2012-03-01T15:22:00.000Z	sharpK	n00gie	whatever had them actually working when I was messing with the nivida control panel... I got it to work but at the cost of stability it seemed, especially when running xbmc on one of them and using the other...
2012-03-01T15:22:00.000Z	sharpK	n00gie	I know, but I can't recall exactly, it's a non-widescreen LCD, probably something like 1024x768 since it's pretty small
2012-03-01T15:23:00.000Z	n00gie	sharpK	you installd the nvidia drivers from ubuntu repositories yea?
2012-03-01T15:23:00.000Z	n00gie	sharpK	also, try setting the displays to slightly lower resolutins than you know they support.
2012-03-01T15:23:00.000Z	sharpK	n00gie	whatever apt-get was on the community forums (or someone gave me here on IRC)
2012-03-01T15:27:00.000Z	n00gie	sharpK	did you connect with X forwarding?
2012-03-01T15:27:00.000Z	sharpK	n00gie	not sure, let me try and see in putty settings
2012-03-01T15:28:00.000Z	n00gie	sharpK	anyway, why would you want to restart unity via ssh?
2012-03-01T15:28:00.000Z	sharpK	n00gie	cause the whole thing is hung up... I can move my mouse and see that giant error, but can't actually do anything... and I'm scared to restart so I don't get that "checking battery state [OK]" deal again which freezes on boot...
