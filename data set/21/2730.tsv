2009-07-09T07:21:00.000Z	billybigrigger		that definitely deserves it :P
2009-07-09T07:21:00.000Z	billybigrigger		no ops alive?
2009-07-09T07:22:00.000Z	billybigrigger		tsk tsk, shame to have that kind of material in a family channel
2009-07-09T07:22:00.000Z	billybigrigger		:)
2009-07-09T07:22:00.000Z	billybigrigger		nope
2009-07-09T07:23:00.000Z	billybigrigger		mikael79_, ppa
2009-07-09T07:24:00.000Z	billybigrigger		i've just gotten into them in the karmic dev cycle myself
2009-07-09T07:24:00.000Z	billybigrigger		i just look to see which one looks most active, or have them sent to me from other people
2009-07-09T07:25:00.000Z	billybigrigger		probably the best choice :P
2009-07-09T07:26:00.000Z	billybigrigger		not sure how :P
2009-07-09T07:28:00.000Z	moymoy	billybigrigger	can it be found in the repos?
2009-07-09T07:29:00.000Z	billybigrigger	moymoy	PPA :P minefield is codename for firefox 3.6
2009-07-09T07:30:00.000Z	moymoy	billybigrigger	ahh i see
2009-07-09T08:33:00.000Z	moymoy	billybigrigger	how is launch speed for minefield?
2009-07-09T08:33:00.000Z	billybigrigger	moymoy	haha i don't now how to time it exactly
2009-07-09T08:33:00.000Z	moymoy	billybigrigger	nothing exact, just relative to the default firefox that comes with ubuntu-desktop
2009-07-09T08:34:00.000Z	billybigrigger	moymoy	oh way quicker, almost instant for me
2009-07-09T08:34:00.000Z	moymoy	billybigrigger	takes forever to launch, when chromium seems to launch instantaneous (as if it were just minimized before)
2009-07-09T08:34:00.000Z	moymoy	billybigrigger	that's good to hear
2009-07-09T08:35:00.000Z	moymoy	billybigrigger	wish more apps launched like that... transmission is pretty quick to launch too, but i prefer deluge
2009-07-09T08:35:00.000Z	moymoy	billybigrigger	and breaks my heart that  deluge isn't that quick =]
