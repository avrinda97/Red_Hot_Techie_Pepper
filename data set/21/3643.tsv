2009-12-13T13:17:00.000Z	pyrophelia		when your creating a raid with mdadm, how do you sepcify the first partion on a series of disks?  is it /dev/sd{a,b,c,d}1 /dev/sd{a,b,c,d}(1) /dev/sd{a,b,c,d}{1}
2009-12-13T13:18:00.000Z	kermit	pyrophelia	in a config file?  those look like at attempt at shell expansion, bubt if you mean shell expansion, the first one
2009-12-13T13:19:00.000Z	pyrophelia	kermit	well no i'll be be building each raid by hand but I have a lot :P
2009-12-13T13:19:00.000Z	pyrophelia		sudo mdadm --create --verbose --force /dev/md0 --level=raid6 --chunk=128   --raid-devices=15  --spare-devices=0  /dev/sd{a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o}1
2009-12-13T13:19:00.000Z	pyrophelia		like that?
2009-12-13T13:19:00.000Z	kermit	pyrophelia	how about /dev/sd[a-o]1
2009-12-13T13:20:00.000Z	kermit	pyrophelia	assuming you have all those devices in /dev/
2009-12-13T13:20:00.000Z	pyrophelia		yea
2009-12-13T13:20:00.000Z	pyrophelia		I didn't know I could use -
2009-12-13T13:24:00.000Z	pyrophelia	kermit	you can't use - when specifying devices for mdadm, they must be in , order
2009-12-13T13:25:00.000Z	kermit	pyrophelia	im still not clear, are you asking about shell expansion or a config file particular to mdadm?
2009-12-13T13:25:00.000Z	pyrophelia		neither, I was building the raid right from the shell
2009-12-13T13:25:00.000Z	pyrophelia		unless that's what you mean by shell expansion
2009-12-13T13:25:00.000Z	kermit	pyrophelia	'shell' was the first choice, yes
2009-12-13T13:25:00.000Z	kermit	pyrophelia	[a-o] will expand in alphabetical order
2009-12-13T13:26:00.000Z	pyrophelia		you might want to double check that
2009-12-13T13:26:00.000Z	pyrophelia		mdadm didn't like it
2009-12-13T13:26:00.000Z	pyrophelia		I changed it to , order and it worked fine
2009-12-13T13:26:00.000Z	kermit	pyrophelia	try 'echo ...' to see for yourself how these things expand
2009-12-13T13:27:00.000Z	kermit	pyrophelia	just put echo in front of the whole line
2009-12-13T13:27:00.000Z	kermit	pyrophelia	rather than speculating about it
