2010-01-20T04:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip__	domi007	so where is the issue?
2010-01-20T04:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip__	domi007	ok thats a little clearer than "connection" which is all you said earlier
2010-01-20T04:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip__	domi007	not something I use, sorry
2010-01-20T04:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip__	domi007	seems to be a feature in microsofts activesync which appears to be windows only
2010-01-20T04:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip__	domi007	i suggest you use the wireless or bluetooth
2010-01-20T04:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip__	domi007	activesync can give addresses to the device on usb and the systm to make a small lan which you can connect stuff over with (according to that page)
2010-01-20T04:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip__	domi007	i use neither PDA nor remote desktop (too slow) so am not much help here outside of websearches
2010-01-20T04:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip__	domi007	go crazy
2010-01-20T04:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip__	domi007	you could use nmap to find all active IPs. I dont think you will get far due to microsoft's closed mindedness
