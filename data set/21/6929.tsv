2007-04-01T10:06:00.000Z	Camden_		hey all ... if there is software that says it works on Mac
2007-04-01T10:07:00.000Z	Camden_		is there a straightforward way to get it to work on linux
2007-04-01T10:07:00.000Z	Camden_		i know mac os x is based on unix
2007-04-01T10:07:00.000Z	Camden_		right?
2007-04-01T10:07:00.000Z	Camden_		to get the mac program to work on linux
2007-04-01T10:07:00.000Z	Camden_		i'm just thinking
2007-04-01T10:08:00.000Z	Camden_		both mac os x and linux are unix-based
2007-04-01T10:08:00.000Z	xtknight	Camden_	mac is unix/bsd sort of.  some unix stuff can be compiled, other stuff is only Mac-safe or Linux-safe, etc
2007-04-01T10:08:00.000Z	xtknight	Camden_	i dont believe it can be executed
2007-04-01T10:08:00.000Z	xtknight	Camden_	what do you mean by web app?
2007-04-01T10:09:00.000Z	xtknight	Camden_	is it java or what?
2007-04-01T10:10:00.000Z	xtknight	Camden_	hmm i doubt you will have any luck running it on linux
2007-04-01T10:10:00.000Z	xtknight	Camden_	only via compatibliity layers like WINE or virtual machines like VirtualBox and vmware.  at least that is the easiest way.  any other way likely requires intense reverse-engineering or even hex editing
2007-04-01T10:11:00.000Z	xtknight	Camden_	wait so this worked in linux befoer?
2007-04-01T10:12:00.000Z	xtknight	Camden_	is it just media player or something?
2007-04-01T10:14:00.000Z	xtknight	Camden_	generally there is some indication of whether it is java, flash, or a media player+javascript program
2007-04-01T10:14:00.000Z	xtknight	Camden_	maybe right click on the web page in certain places if right click is enabled, etc
2007-04-01T10:15:00.000Z	xtknight	Camden_	hard to say... requires a good eye sometimes.
2007-04-01T11:02:00.000Z	xtknight	Camden_	take it elsewhere
2007-04-01T11:06:00.000Z	xtknight	Camden_	hrm which compress program?
2007-04-01T11:07:00.000Z	xtknight	Camden_	probably old style Ar  or something
