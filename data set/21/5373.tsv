2007-11-01T22:04:00.000Z	CubeXombi		<Happyfeet> in nano it's ctrl+o to save and ctrl x to exit.. just kinda wierd but still better than vi
2007-11-01T22:06:00.000Z	CubeXombi		I've gotten my WIFI to connect to my router with no encryption yet i cannot surf/ping (even by ip) any idea?
2007-11-01T22:07:00.000Z	joar	CubeXombi	dows your wifi card have any IP ?
2007-11-01T22:07:00.000Z	CubeXombi	joar	yeah I'm getting a 10.0.0.103 from my router, though i can't ping it
2007-11-01T22:08:00.000Z	joar	CubeXombi	in a terminal typing 'ifconfig' should show you, in the same terminal typing 'iwconfig' should show which card is the wifi card
2007-11-01T22:08:00.000Z	joar	CubeXombi	ok, try typing 'route' and see what U get
2007-11-01T22:09:00.000Z	CubeXombi	joar	in both all setting look right my gateway is 10.0.0.1, subnet of 255.255.255.0 and my essid is "mowo" my router, signal is at 100 %
2007-11-01T22:10:00.000Z	joar	CubeXombi	ok, sure you don't have any firewall running blocking ICMP ?
2007-11-01T22:10:00.000Z	joar	CubeXombi	if you install 'firestarter' you'll find out quickly
2007-11-01T22:11:00.000Z	CubeXombi	joar	though currently I'm wired .. cause well iwouldn;t be online otherwise, as far as the Firewall is concerned, Firestarter isn't installed at the moment.
2007-11-01T22:11:00.000Z	joar	CubeXombi	ok, if wire works, wifi should too
2007-11-01T22:11:00.000Z	joar	CubeXombi	when issuing iwconfig, can you see the MAC adress belonging to the AP you're conected ?
2007-11-01T22:12:00.000Z	CubeXombi	joar	yup,
2007-11-01T22:12:00.000Z	joar	CubeXombi	what type of wifi card is this ? (chip ? ) , for instance I've got a Ralink card myself, it needs the rt61 module, which was really buggy in feisty, and I'm not sure what to think yet in gutsy
2007-11-01T22:14:00.000Z	CubeXombi	joar	I'm using an rt8185, I've also tested with an rt8187.. both gave the same craptacular results. i know the chipset to be working though, and I've even blacklisted the kernel mods for them as r8180 and r8187 seem to lock systems... I may try a static Ip and see what i can do that way..
2007-11-01T22:16:00.000Z	joar	CubeXombi	yeah, haven't got any better idea
2007-11-01T22:18:00.000Z	joar	CubeXombi	it worked in feisty ? ok, hmm, are you downloading the modules from http://www.ralinktech.com/ralink/Home/Support/Linux.html ?
2007-11-01T22:20:00.000Z	CubeXombi	joar	nope, I've been trying with ndiswrapper
2007-11-01T22:22:00.000Z	joar	CubeXombi	ok, can't see any rt8185 modules there, thought maby rt = ralink chip, but misunderstood I think
2007-11-01T22:22:00.000Z	joar	CubeXombi	anyway, those modules made my card stabile in feisty
2007-11-01T22:40:00.000Z	CubeXombi	joar	- working now.. had to go with a static filtering instead...
