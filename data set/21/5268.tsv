2007-11-21T18:38:00.000Z	RobJ		I've heard of a 'Synaptic's tool, in Ubuntu that would install the package. But i've looked in Kubuntu and cannot find it.
2007-11-21T18:38:00.000Z	Pici	RobJ	adept is the KDE package manager
2007-11-21T18:39:00.000Z	Pici	RobJ	How many times have you tried to install studio?
2007-11-21T19:12:00.000Z	Pici	RobJ	install the ubuntustudio-desktop package.
2007-11-21T19:13:00.000Z	RobJ	Pici	Where do i get that?
2007-11-21T19:13:00.000Z	Pici	RobJ	Its in the repositories
2007-11-21T19:13:00.000Z	RobJ	Pici	 I'm lost?  Do i insert my Studio CD?
2007-11-21T19:14:00.000Z	Pici	RobJ	in adept, search for ubuntustudo-desktop, then install it.
2007-11-21T19:15:00.000Z	RobJ	Pici	I'm guessing i need my internet.  My network cable to my router is shared between the computer and this laptop. I'll come back soon and give an update as to whether its worked. :) Thanks for now!
2007-11-21T19:15:00.000Z	Pici	RobJ	good luck
2007-11-21T19:21:00.000Z	Pici	RobJ	You're running an install, not the LiveCD< right?

2007-11-21T19:23:00.000Z	RobJ	Pici	It ask's me for a password, is this my user password?
2007-11-21T19:23:00.000Z	Pici	RobJ	indeed.
