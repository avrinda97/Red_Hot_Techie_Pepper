2009-03-23T00:16:00.000Z	Unggnu		hi all
2009-03-23T00:16:00.000Z	Unggnu		Is it possible to use Atheros 802.11g with 64 Bit Ubuntu?
2009-03-23T00:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Unggnu	which atheros chip is it?
2009-03-23T00:17:00.000Z	Unggnu	ActionParsnip1	the 108 MBps one
2009-03-23T00:17:00.000Z	Unggnu	ActionParsnip1	pci :)
2009-03-23T00:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Unggnu	can you run: lspci | grep -i atheros
2009-03-23T00:17:00.000Z	Unggnu	ActionParsnip1	I don't have it, I am plan to buy it :)
2009-03-23T00:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Unggnu	you need the chip model so you can check, atheros make many chips
2009-03-23T00:19:00.000Z	Unggnu	ActionParsnip1	This card is mentioned to run under Ubuntu, I just don't know if it runs with 64 Bit
2009-03-23T00:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Unggnu	then it will run in both 64 and 32bit
2009-03-23T00:19:00.000Z	Unggnu	ActionParsnip1	has madwifi still the 64 Bit issue?
2009-03-23T00:19:00.000Z	Unggnu	ActionParsnip1	cool, thanks
2009-03-23T00:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Unggnu	not sure, didnt know there was one
2009-03-23T00:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Unggnu	you need to know if its an A242x or AR5001X or whatever
2009-03-23T00:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Unggnu	atheros is usually prestty supported, some arent though so check the chip
2009-03-23T00:22:00.000Z	Unggnu	ActionParsnip1	But there was a problem with 64 Bit in the past because of the firmware?
2009-03-23T00:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Unggnu	im not aware of it, i always buy off the HCL and all of my hardware has worked out of the box 100% of the time
2009-03-23T00:27:00.000Z	Unggnu	ActionParsnip1	Do you know if the Atheros driver work fine with hidden ssids?
2009-03-23T00:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Unggnu	mine does yes, thats the network manager app not the chip's job
2009-03-23T00:31:00.000Z	Unggnu	ActionParsnip1	NM coudn't handle it with Ndiswrapper
2009-03-23T00:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Unggnu	then you need a supported chip. http://efficientpc.co.uk/accessories/wireless/wg311t/  thats mine and it works out of the box since gutsy
