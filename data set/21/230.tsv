2012-07-07T21:15:00.000Z	Griffrez	VirtualBlackness	I'm a complete n00b to Linux enviroment.
2012-07-07T21:03:00.000Z	Griffrez	VirtualBlackness	That was what I was getting to. I would want to know who would have the best performance.
2012-07-07T21:04:00.000Z	Griffrez	VirtualBlackness	And you misunderstood what I wanted to compare. I want to compare the drivers that get automatically detected for download by Ubuntu, or the ones provided by ATI, directly, at their website.
2012-07-07T21:05:00.000Z	VirtualBlackness	Griffrez	that is precisely what you are doing. The proprietary driver gives better performance. I did not misunderstand.
2012-07-07T21:10:00.000Z	VirtualBlackness	Griffrez	you will have video accelleration, h.264 and 3d will utilize the vaapi with the proprietary driver. The radeon driver was made open source by ATI way back in the day, and they no longer maintain it. The fglrx driver is produced by ATI with ever dropping card support, but for what they do support they support gpu accelleration and all the new bits (compositing etc) which make for a better experience, typically.
2012-07-07T21:11:00.000Z	Griffrez	VirtualBlackness	So, if I want the MAIN OPEN source driver... I just... don't install anything else?
2012-07-07T21:15:00.000Z	Griffrez	VirtualBlackness	Well. I appreciate your help.
2012-07-07T21:18:00.000Z	Griffrez	VirtualBlackness	Yes. I've had problems with it before. One of my monitors doesn't seem to have EDEI (I think that's how it is called) information, so, the Refresh Rate goes off range...
2012-07-07T21:19:00.000Z	Griffrez	VirtualBlackness	I know that.
2012-07-07T21:19:00.000Z	Griffrez	VirtualBlackness	But the prop Driver, on my previous installations, was trying unvalid refresh rates, on the start. So I could even change the RR.
2012-07-07T21:19:00.000Z	Griffrez	VirtualBlackness	Yeah... commands... -genius-
2012-07-07T21:20:00.000Z	Griffrez	VirtualBlackness	I need a lot of insight...
2012-07-07T21:20:00.000Z	Griffrez	VirtualBlackness	I'll slowly learn, if I grow determination in me.
2012-07-07T21:27:00.000Z	VirtualBlackness	Griffrez	there is not usually a good reason to compile from source if you are new to linux. What are you trying to install, firefox?
2012-07-07T21:28:00.000Z	VirtualBlackness	Griffrez	nm... listen to ActionParsnip
2012-07-07T21:29:00.000Z	VirtualBlackness	Griffrez	However I believe the difference is going to be mostly between windows firefox and linux firefox, not ubuntu firefox and mozilla linux firefox.
2012-07-07T21:30:00.000Z	Griffrez	VirtualBlackness	I guess.
2012-07-07T21:35:00.000Z	Griffrez	VirtualBlackness	Thanks.
2012-07-07T21:36:00.000Z	Griffrez	VirtualBlackness	I try to be as nice as possible to make up for my fail at using Ubuntu. :P
2012-07-07T21:36:00.000Z	VirtualBlackness	Griffrez	you have nothing to make up for. You are learning linux. I applaud you.
2012-07-07T21:37:00.000Z	Griffrez	VirtualBlackness	Okay. I got GNOME installed... how do I switch to it... log off? And there will be an enviroment option?
