2011-05-16T01:40:00.000Z	vectory_		can someone explain to me the two different outputs in this simple commands?
2011-05-16T01:40:00.000Z	vectory_		http://paste.ubuntu.com/608007/
2011-05-16T01:42:00.000Z	pfifo	vectory_	whats the problem?
2011-05-16T01:43:00.000Z	vectory_	pfifo	i would expect both lines to yield the same output
2011-05-16T01:43:00.000Z	pfifo	vectory_	I think it may be because of the back ticks in the second command
2011-05-16T01:44:00.000Z	vectory_	pfifo	do you know what the back ticks are supposed to do?
2011-05-16T01:45:00.000Z	pfifo	vectory_	it is executing whats in side them and piping the output to the echo command, I suspect its doing this before receiving the filename from find
2011-05-16T01:46:00.000Z	vectory_	pfifo	doing so before receiving the filename from find is impossible, then it couldnt output anything
2011-05-16T01:48:00.000Z	pfifo	vectory_	Im 99% sure that its not running the 3 commands in the order you think they are
2011-05-16T01:49:00.000Z	pfifo	vectory_	IE first it runs find, then its running basename, and then finally is running echo from the -exec switch and tacking on the filename
2011-05-16T01:50:00.000Z	vectory_	pfifo	thats what i want
2011-05-16T01:50:00.000Z	pfifo	vectory_	no you seem to want, the filename given to basename and then its output piped to echo
2011-05-16T01:51:00.000Z	pfifo	vectory_	the backticks are creating the problem here
2011-05-16T01:52:00.000Z	pfifo	vectory_	whats wrong with the first command? why not just call basename directly?
2011-05-16T01:53:00.000Z	vectory_	pfifo	i want to use -exec diff `basename {}` {}
2011-05-16T01:54:00.000Z	pfifo	vectory_	well, diff has an option to compare directories, if you really need to use find, consider having find create a shell script
2011-05-16T01:55:00.000Z	vectory_	pfifo	om tired of reading man pages over and over again, i thought that was possible to accomplish with just what i know
2011-05-16T01:57:00.000Z	pfifo	vectory_	normally you use diff on a directory, its kinda rare to just use it on one file, and noone ever makes a large set of diff files like that
2011-05-16T01:57:00.000Z	vectory_	pfifo	so diff isnt used to create patches usable with patch cmd?
2011-05-16T01:58:00.000Z	pfifo	vectory_	yes, it is. but you dont patch a file, you patch the entire directory
2011-05-16T01:59:00.000Z	pfifo	vectory_	`diff orig/ new/ > mypatch.diff && cd orig && patch -p1 < ../mypatch.diff`
