2009-12-22T08:56:00.000Z	crc32		I was already running 9.10 The system said there were 9 packages to be updated so I said "apt-get upgrade"

2009-12-22T08:57:00.000Z	crc32		halt did nothing
2009-12-22T08:57:00.000Z	crc32		shutdown did nothing.
2009-12-22T08:57:00.000Z	crc32		Alt-Ctrl-Del did nothing
2009-12-22T08:57:00.000Z	crc32		shutdown -r now
2009-12-22T08:58:00.000Z	crc32		It just returns back to the "#" prompt
2009-12-22T08:59:00.000Z	crc32		Where does bootlogd keep its log
2009-12-22T09:00:00.000Z	crc32		I'm totally not happy with uuntu right now.
2009-12-22T09:01:00.000Z	crc32		Ubuntu keeps insisting I upgrade packages and I'm like "Sure ok, this is ubunto not Gentoo, ubuntu would never screw me over for just applying upgrades."
2009-12-22T09:02:00.000Z	akk	crc32	Even on LTS, upgrades sometimes mess things up. :(
2009-12-22T09:03:00.000Z	crc32	akk	Never happend to me before except on gentoo. And even on gentoo it was something dumb like SSH broke so you could still recover from the localconsole. This is like "Poof your can't boot anymore".
2009-12-22T09:04:00.000Z	akk	crc32	When "can't boot anymore" stuff happens to me with ubuntu it's usually X server settings involving DRI/GL.
2009-12-22T09:04:00.000Z	akk	crc32	(not saying it is for you, just that that sort of thing seems to happen to me a lot)
2009-12-22T09:05:00.000Z	crc32	akk	Thats another thing I boot into console to avoid any damage like that but now its like I can't even get that far
2009-12-22T09:06:00.000Z	akk	crc32	Ouch. Can it boot single-user?
2009-12-22T09:06:00.000Z	crc32		reinstall grub boo loader woulden't help me right since well a kernel came up already.
2009-12-22T09:07:00.000Z	crc32	akk	Nope this problem happens before even that as it hangs right after fsck supposedly give the file system a clean bill of health. It feels more like this problem is during the ramdisk chroot to the root file system.
2009-12-22T09:08:00.000Z	crc32		Or something like the root file system isn't being mounted or mounted read only or something stupid like that.
2009-12-22T09:09:00.000Z	akk	crc32	Could it possibly be something related to bug 447747 ?
2009-12-22T09:10:00.000Z	akk	crc32	I had a "can't boot" problem because of that, https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/447747
