2010-03-29T09:38:00.000Z	SwimmingRat		Can you help me? My Ubuntu freezes. Repeatedly.  Is 9.10, up from 9.04. 32 bit AMD. No fancy stuff. Use xchat, FF, Chrome, Transmission.  --- someone asked me about what dmesg says... This is it. http://pastebin.com/UgYqvvcX
2010-03-29T09:38:00.000Z	PHP_Arun	SwimmingRat	are you using an external storage device to run your ubuntu 9.10 Karamic Koala?
2010-03-29T09:39:00.000Z	SwimmingRat		no
2010-03-29T09:39:00.000Z	SwimmingRat	PHP_Arun	no I am not using any external storage device
2010-03-29T09:40:00.000Z	PHP_Arun		actually, since most of the ubuntus Karmic are available in 64 bit version, its difficult for your 32 bit AMD to hold the instruction set long enough for executing
2010-03-29T09:40:00.000Z	PHP_Arun		i see
2010-03-29T09:40:00.000Z	SwimmingRat	PHP_Arun	I do not have a 64 bit machine, do I?
2010-03-29T09:40:00.000Z	PHP_Arun		so i think, you must make sure that you are running a 32 bit i386 version OS on the system
2010-03-29T09:40:00.000Z	PHP_Arun		no u dont
2010-03-29T09:40:00.000Z	PHP_Arun		but ur OS is 64 bit
2010-03-29T09:40:00.000Z	SwimmingRat		it is?
2010-03-29T09:40:00.000Z	PHP_Arun		yes it is
2010-03-29T09:41:00.000Z	PHP_Arun		did you order a CD or downloaded it from the net?
2010-03-29T09:41:00.000Z	SwimmingRat	PHP_Arun	can I reinstall Ubuntu with the correct version without wiping my hard drive.
2010-03-29T09:41:00.000Z	PHP_Arun		if so, i am 101 % sure about the OS being a 64 bit one.
2010-03-29T09:41:00.000Z	PHP_Arun		yes u can
2010-03-29T09:41:00.000Z	PHP_Arun		well for it, you will only have to erase the boot loader and the MBR.
2010-03-29T09:41:00.000Z	PHP_Arun		and then start ubuntu  in live mode
2010-03-29T09:42:00.000Z	PHP_Arun		and select a partition where no OS resides
2010-03-29T09:42:00.000Z	PHP_Arun		right ZykoticK9
2010-03-29T09:43:00.000Z	SwimmingRat	PHP_Arun	 and ZykoticK9   --> uname -m
