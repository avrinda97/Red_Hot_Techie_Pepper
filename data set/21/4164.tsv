2008-06-24T09:23:00.000Z	grtessman		danbhfive... I downloaded the sun-java6-plugin_6-06-0ubuntu1_i386.deb    and the package installer says "Status:  Error:  Wrong architecture 'i386'
2008-06-24T09:24:00.000Z	wols	grtessman	on amd64 you need to use nspluginwrappre with this package
2008-06-24T09:24:00.000Z	wols	grtessman	dpkg --print-architecture
2008-06-24T09:24:00.000Z	grtessman	wols	I am not using amd, I am using intel
2008-06-24T09:25:00.000Z	wols	grtessman	use the command I just wrote
2008-06-24T09:25:00.000Z	grtessman	wols	  interesting       ﻿dpkg --print-architecture  =  ﻿amd64
2008-06-24T09:25:00.000Z	grtessman	wols	but I dont have an amd64
2008-06-24T09:28:00.000Z	grtessman	wols	what does that mean?
2008-06-24T09:28:00.000Z	wols	grtessman	emt64 is the same as amd64. and the architecture is called amd64 since AMD was first
2008-06-24T09:29:00.000Z	wols	grtessman	32bit is called i386 and it works not only for intel cpus but amd athlons too
2008-06-24T09:29:00.000Z	grtessman	wols	but my processors are intel - I used wubi to install ubuntu - does that mean I need to re-install it?
2008-06-24T09:29:00.000Z	wols	grtessman	since you used wubi, I would
2008-06-24T09:30:00.000Z	wols	grtessman	amd64 is fine tho. but you shouldn't use a 64bit distro unless you really know what you are doing AND have more than 4GB RAM that you really need
2008-06-24T09:30:00.000Z	grtessman	wols	danbhfive - so the question remains, what should I be using for my dual core intel processors?  I'd assume not amd
2008-06-24T09:30:00.000Z	wols	grtessman	32bit ubuntu
2008-06-24T09:30:00.000Z	grtessman	wols	 I have 4GB ram and dual core 2.2ghz processors
2008-06-24T09:30:00.000Z	wols	grtessman	32bit then
2008-06-24T09:31:00.000Z	grtessman	wols	and danbhfive,... wow, ok - maybe that's not an option in wubi.  I'll have to delete and re-install and check it out again.  But certainly I learned a lot, and this is probably the core of my problems.
2008-06-24T09:32:00.000Z	wols	grtessman	it has nothing to do with wubi. but do not use wubi
2008-06-24T09:33:00.000Z	grtessman	wols	ok why?
2008-06-24T09:39:00.000Z	wols	grtessman	YES
