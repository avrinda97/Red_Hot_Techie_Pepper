2011-03-21T09:48:00.000Z	cfedde	h3r0_	then I'm not sure what is broke.  What are the errors again?
2011-03-21T09:49:00.000Z	cfedde	h3r0_	oh! so apache is having trouble...
2011-03-21T09:51:00.000Z	cfedde	h3r0_	error messages are always tough to understand.
2011-03-21T09:52:00.000Z	cfedde	h3r0_	I'm still working the trouble too.
2011-03-21T09:57:00.000Z	cfedde	h3r0_	did you try KB1JWQ's advice and google the error message?
2011-03-21T10:00:00.000Z	cfedde	h3r0_	so the nagios daemon is running?
2011-03-21T10:01:00.000Z	cfedde	h3r0_	there is a #nagios channel here. But it tends to be pretty idle.  Maybe you'll hve more luck asking there.
