2012-06-02T06:57:00.000Z	Crooper		why won't aptitude upgrade 2 packages that are labeled to be upgraded... no errors print out either
2012-06-02T06:58:00.000Z	Crooper		fat32 only takes files less than 4GB
2012-06-02T07:00:00.000Z	Crooper		it's not the partition... he can have big partitions but the package being written to it can't be 4GB or bigger
2012-06-02T07:01:00.000Z	Crooper		i have 32GB micros with fat32 on it  but can't write anything 4GB or bigger
2012-06-02T07:01:00.000Z	melkor	Crooper	isn't that a problem with fat32?
2012-06-02T07:02:00.000Z	Crooper		i have 500GB hardrives that are fat32
2012-06-02T07:02:00.000Z	melkor	Crooper	that's somewhat crazy
2012-06-02T07:03:00.000Z	Crooper		that's right the limit with fat32 is files can't be 4GB or bigger
2012-06-02T07:03:00.000Z	Crooper		then youd go with ntfs
2012-06-02T07:03:00.000Z	Crooper		or ext4
2012-06-02T07:04:00.000Z	Crooper		but if you have a universal hardrive, winblows doesn't read ext4
2012-06-02T07:05:00.000Z	melkor	Crooper	I use ntfs, I think ext3 works with windows not by default but when you install the driver it works rather well.
2012-06-02T07:06:00.000Z	Crooper		unless u're running linux exclusively you want to use a windows safe format
2012-06-02T07:06:00.000Z	Crooper		linux reads windows
2012-06-02T07:07:00.000Z	melkor	Crooper	the ntfs drivers are reverse engineered, the windows based ext drivers are open source for accessing an open source resource.
2012-06-02T07:07:00.000Z	Crooper	melkor	that might be true but i don't trust alot of drivers in windows ( that's just my opinion)
2012-06-02T07:08:00.000Z	melkor	Crooper	we have two 1tb drives that cannot read/write past 600megs. The problem could be that the kernel in use is 2.6.10 or something unrully.
2012-06-02T07:08:00.000Z	Crooper		what system are you using to write/read with melkor /
2012-06-02T07:09:00.000Z	melkor	Crooper	it is an old fedora something or other. It is used as a server and should never have been. To make matters worse dev packages weren't installed so new/updated packages cannot be compiled.
2012-06-02T07:10:00.000Z	Crooper		ahhh, sounds frustrating melkor
2012-06-02T07:10:00.000Z	melkor	Crooper	well, it hasn't broken yet, but it just lacks all the new tools.
