2006-05-26T16:56:00.000Z	PVZ		what is a "libXext"?
2006-05-26T16:56:00.000Z	amphi	PVZ	part of X
2006-05-26T16:57:00.000Z	amphi	PVZ	"X Window System miscellaneous extension library", quoth apt-cache
2006-05-26T16:57:00.000Z	PVZ	amphi	amaroK 1.3.9 installation says I don't have a libXext,how do I...er,get one?
2006-05-26T16:57:00.000Z	amphi	PVZ	you install from source?
2006-05-26T16:58:00.000Z	amphi	PVZ	why? ;) if you're installing from source, you should really know how to fix this...
2006-05-26T16:58:00.000Z	PVZ	amphi	I don't :P
2006-05-26T16:59:00.000Z	amphi	PVZ	why are you building amarok yourself?
2006-05-26T05:08:00.000Z	PVZ	amphi	i didn't even install it yet :)
2006-05-26T05:00:00.000Z	amphi	PVZ	better to go with the packaged version if you can; if not, you want the libXext dev package (for the lib headers)
2006-05-26T05:01:00.000Z	PVZ	amphi	I prefer the packaged version too,but I couldn't find it
2006-05-26T05:01:00.000Z	amphi	PVZ	^^^
2006-05-26T05:02:00.000Z	amphi	PVZ	the downside of installing from source is that you must maintain it yourself in perpetuity
2006-05-26T05:03:00.000Z	PVZ	amphi	if I install it from source I can't update it on a packaged version later?
2006-05-26T05:04:00.000Z	amphi	PVZ	you could install the packaged version and remove the one you built, yes
2006-05-26T05:04:00.000Z	PVZ	amphi	how do I remove the one I built? haha
2006-05-26T05:05:00.000Z	amphi	PVZ	aye, there's the rub ;) you can try 'sudo make uninstall' and hope the makefile has an uninstall target (some do), or do 'make -n install | less' to see what make install did, and manually undo it
2006-05-26T05:07:00.000Z	PVZ	amphi	i think the guy knew that the channel is ubuntu-es,he was trying "join / #ubuntu-es"
2006-05-26T05:08:00.000Z	amphi	PVZ	ah
2006-05-26T05:08:00.000Z	amphi	PVZ	make uninstall working for you?
2006-05-26T05:08:00.000Z	amphi	PVZ	oh, good ;)
