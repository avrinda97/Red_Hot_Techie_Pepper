2011-07-15T21:11:00.000Z	agreenbhm		that's what i'm trying to figure out
2011-07-15T21:11:00.000Z	coz_	agreenbhm	 i would certainly install linux   ,, play with w hat is possible with the configuration,, which video card?
2011-07-15T21:11:00.000Z	agreenbhm		i thought "o, i'll put ubuntu server on there", but then thought: and then what...
2011-07-15T21:12:00.000Z	agreenbhm		built in video
2011-07-15T21:12:00.000Z	coz_	agreenbhm	 do you know which built in?
2011-07-15T21:12:00.000Z	agreenbhm		no idea
2011-07-15T21:12:00.000Z	coz_	agreenbhm	 intel   nvidia ??
2011-07-15T21:12:00.000Z	agreenbhm		intel i'm sure
2011-07-15T21:12:00.000Z	coz_	agreenbhm	 is it running at the moment?
2011-07-15T21:12:00.000Z	agreenbhm		no
2011-07-15T21:13:00.000Z	agreenbhm		there's no OS
2011-07-15T21:13:00.000Z	agreenbhm		it's got a clean raid5
2011-07-15T21:13:00.000Z	coz_	agreenbhm	ah ok,, first thing I w ould do is install ubuntu,, or some flavor  and see what happens in terms of performance,, old hardware compatibility  et c
2011-07-15T21:13:00.000Z	agreenbhm		i've got room on my VM hosts for testing, so this is more of an "f around b/c why not" box
2011-07-15T21:14:00.000Z	agreenbhm		any way to start the ubuntu setup and then SSH into it to finish the setup?
2011-07-15T21:14:00.000Z	agreenbhm		i don't feel like sitting in the server room
2011-07-15T21:14:00.000Z	coz_	agreenbhm	 understood,, my first thing would be to install ubuntu,, compare its performance on that older hardware,, go from there
2011-07-15T21:14:00.000Z	coz_	agreenbhm	 turn it into a multimedia center  maybe
