2012-08-16T01:47:00.000Z	testis		hi anyone can help me with kernel cross-compile?
2012-08-16T01:48:00.000Z	testis		compile for mips
2012-08-16T01:48:00.000Z	testis		on x86
2012-08-16T01:48:00.000Z	testis		i follow around 50 tutorials and now am lost
2012-08-16T01:49:00.000Z	testis		i tryed kernels from http://www.linux-mips.org/wiki/Getting_the_kernel, also from kernels.org
2012-08-16T01:50:00.000Z	TJ-	testis	which mips are you buidling for?
2012-08-16T01:50:00.000Z	testis		mips32
2012-08-16T01:52:00.000Z	testis		it'a actually mipsel BCM97xxx Settop Platform
2012-08-16T01:52:00.000Z	testis		dm500hd
2012-08-16T01:52:00.000Z	testis		i did that in makefile
2012-08-16T01:53:00.000Z	testis		then do i need mipsel compiler? binutils, gcc?
2012-08-16T01:53:00.000Z	testis		i successfully compiled some .c files, and bin's working on mips device
2012-08-16T01:53:00.000Z	testis		can i use that toolchain?
2012-08-16T01:54:00.000Z	TJ-	testis	I cross-built a few months ago for an embedded device... I think I may have written up the howto
2012-08-16T01:54:00.000Z	testis		it's somewhere in my /home folder
2012-08-16T01:54:00.000Z	testis		@TJ where i can find that?
2012-08-16T01:56:00.000Z	testis	sveinse	yes, i tryed like in tutorials but showed me million errors
2012-08-16T01:56:00.000Z	TJ-	testis	See the "Building from source" section of my article http://tjworld.net/wiki/Linux/Embedded/Infineon/Danube/ADSL2PCI
2012-08-16T01:57:00.000Z	testis		@TJ thank you
2012-08-16T01:57:00.000Z	testis	sveinse	yes, one is missing some headers like "boundari.h", i will check TJ's tut
2012-08-16T01:58:00.000Z	TJ-	testis	I just checked... sorry ... looks like I never wrote up the kernel build instructions, although they would be pretty standard after you've installed the cross-toolchain
