2012-09-03T22:13:00.000Z	theseb		why is the 64bit ubuntu iso called amd64? is AMD the only company that makes 64bit cpus?
2012-09-03T22:14:00.000Z	tesuji	theseb	they defined the first 64 bit architecture
2012-09-03T22:15:00.000Z	theseb	tesuji	thanks...i have a Intel Core 2 Quad CPU    Q9550.....is that 64bit?
2012-09-03T22:16:00.000Z	tesuji	theseb	yes thats 64 bit
2012-09-03T22:16:00.000Z	tesuji	theseb	but 32 bit applications generally work better unless you need precision computing
2012-09-03T22:17:00.000Z	tesuji	theseb	I have 64bit and everything works
2012-09-03T22:17:00.000Z	theseb	tesuji	wait...did you install 64bit or are you making the case it is better to install 32bit ubuntu on a 64bit cpu?
2012-09-03T22:19:00.000Z	tesuji	theseb	kindof both. I installed 64 bit and 2 years ago it took me a while to get things to work. Now i reinstalled 64bit and it worked fine too. what I am saying is that you should get both types of applications for things that like hardware
2012-09-03T22:19:00.000Z	theseb	tesuji	thanks
2012-09-03T22:20:00.000Z	theseb	tesuji	is 64bit FASTER? there must be some advantage otherwise why not just put the more reliable 32bit ubuntu on your machine?
2012-09-03T22:20:00.000Z	tesuji	theseb	no its not faster
2012-09-03T22:20:00.000Z	theseb	tesuji	*sigh*..then what is the point?
2012-09-03T22:20:00.000Z	tesuji	theseb	it depends on your memory
2012-09-03T22:21:00.000Z	tesuji	theseb	there is only so much room for memory adresses in 32 bits of space
2012-09-03T22:21:00.000Z	theseb	tesuji	really? i just got 32bit all nice and i'm not sure if i should REINSTALL w/ 64bit ubuntu
2012-09-03T22:21:00.000Z	tesuji	theseb	how much memory do you have
2012-09-03T22:21:00.000Z	theseb	tesuji	4 gigs
2012-09-03T22:21:00.000Z	tesuji	theseb	32 bit is fine then
2012-09-03T22:21:00.000Z	tesuji	theseb	the speedups are SOOOO small you would not notice them. they are around 8%
2012-09-03T22:38:00.000Z	theseb	tesuji	gordonjcp: thank you very much for the help
2012-09-03T22:38:00.000Z	tesuji	theseb	no problem you know we love you
