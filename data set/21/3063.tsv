2009-04-26T02:52:00.000Z	PlasmaSheep	mneptok	where?
2009-07-01T03:49:00.000Z	mneptok	PlasmaSheep	apt is what you should always use. i say this as a former Senior Ubuntu System Support Analyst for Canonical. you are welcome to disagree, but i think my opinion and experience carries more weight.
2009-07-01T03:49:00.000Z	PlasmaSheep	mneptok	Do you play many games?
2009-07-01T03:50:00.000Z	mneptok	PlasmaSheep	no. i'm busy actually doing work.
2009-07-01T03:51:00.000Z	mneptok	PlasmaSheep	the fact that games aren't packaged for Debian doesn;t mean you should not use apt whenever possible. full stop.
2009-07-01T03:51:00.000Z	PlasmaSheep	mneptok	then you wouldn't notice that there are no up to date games in apt except solitaire and wurms
2009-07-01T03:51:00.000Z	mneptok	PlasmaSheep	see above
2009-07-01T03:51:00.000Z	mneptok	PlasmaSheep	apt is what you should use *wnerevr possible*
2009-07-01T03:52:00.000Z	PlasmaSheep	mneptok	well, that's different :P
2010-01-26T04:59:00.000Z	mneptok	PlasmaSheep	use files >4GB in size much?
2010-01-26T04:59:00.000Z	PlasmaSheep	mneptok	No, why?
2010-01-26T05:00:00.000Z	mneptok	PlasmaSheep	make a partition formatted FAT32. *far* fewer issues mounting it and getting perms settled.
2010-01-26T05:01:00.000Z	PlasmaSheep	mneptok	my hard drive is 50 gb. Why would I make another partition, and why would I want to use it?
