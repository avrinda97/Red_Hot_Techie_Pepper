2009-10-09T14:45:00.000Z	hunney_buns		so i have this network problem, trying to get the network card to connect, apparently i have done some good, because it does now power up in nux. it connects to my router physically, i know this because of the leds on the network card. i have followed this guide http://www.kanonbra.com/index.php/projects/various
2009-10-09T14:47:00.000Z	hunney_buns		but i can not see the interface in ubuntu, even though if i do a sudo lshw -C Network it actually recognizes my card, and even shows the correct link speed. it still does not say im connected to anything, e.g i do not get an ip
2009-10-09T14:48:00.000Z	zwamkat	hunney_buns	Can you give it a static IP?
2009-10-09T14:48:00.000Z	hunney_buns		let me try, 2 secs
2009-10-09T14:52:00.000Z	hunney_buns	zwamkat	no, i can define it in connections, if i ping my router 192.168.1.2 it says Connec: Network is unreachable
2009-10-09T14:53:00.000Z	zwamkat		Hunney_buns: How many NIC's do you have?
2009-10-09T14:53:00.000Z	hunney_buns		how do i find that out easiest?
2009-10-09T14:54:00.000Z	zwamkat		Open a terminal, ifconfig
2009-10-09T14:54:00.000Z	hunney_buns		ifconfig
2009-10-09T14:54:00.000Z	zwamkat		yes
2009-10-09T14:54:00.000Z	hunney_buns		lol, other keyboard ^^
2009-10-09T14:54:00.000Z	zwamkat		Haha!
2009-10-09T14:55:00.000Z	zwamkat		What is a decent site to post temp config files?
2009-10-09T14:55:00.000Z	hunney_buns		it gives me eth0 and lo, it actually says at the last line of eth0 Interrupt:251
2009-10-09T14:56:00.000Z	zwamkat		Does the last line contain an address? Like "Base address:0x2000"
2009-10-09T14:56:00.000Z	hunney_buns		nope not at all, it also says 0 packets bytes and etc,
2009-10-09T14:57:00.000Z	hunney_buns		i would pastebin it but i am having some network problems ;)

2009-10-09T14:57:00.000Z	zwamkat		Can you post the outcome of ifconfig & /etc/network/interfaces ?
