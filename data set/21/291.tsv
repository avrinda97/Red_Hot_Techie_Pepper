2012-03-29T18:57:00.000Z	multiHYP		if I want to reject connection on specific ports I have to define it in the iptables? I thought whatever was not specified as ACCEPT was automatically rejected.
2012-03-29T18:57:00.000Z	ikonia	multiHYP	depends if your default is allow or deny
2012-03-29T18:57:00.000Z	multiHYP	ikonia	what is my default?
2012-03-29T18:58:00.000Z	ikonia	multiHYP	I thought it was allow on ubuntu, but I'm not sure, ufw sets it "open" by default I think
2012-03-29T18:59:00.000Z	ikonia	multiHYP	ufw is there by default
2012-03-29T18:59:00.000Z	ikonia	multiHYP	so adding direct with iptables may cause you some problems unless you disable it
2012-03-29T18:59:00.000Z	ikonia	multiHYP	then it should be open
2012-03-29T19:02:00.000Z	ikonia	multiHYP	no, I believe iptables default to open with no rules
2012-03-29T19:02:00.000Z	ikonia	multiHYP	create you allow rules, then do a block all
2012-03-29T19:03:00.000Z	ikonia	multiHYP	why don't you use ufw if you don't know how to use iptables
2012-03-29T19:03:00.000Z	ikonia	multiHYP	you'll find it much easier as it's got a pretty straightforward usage
2012-03-29T19:04:00.000Z	ikonia	multiHYP	yet you can't use the more grown up tool, so maybe you should consider "using" the joke, if the serious tools is beyond you
2012-03-29T19:04:00.000Z	multiHYP	ikonia	it fundtions or rather fails as easily as its to set up. (ufw)
2012-03-29T19:04:00.000Z	ikonia	multiHYP	it doesn't fail at all
2012-03-29T19:04:00.000Z	multiHYP	ikonia	you seem to not be able to help me with iptables
2012-03-29T19:04:00.000Z	ikonia	multiHYP	I can, I just suggest you use a tool thats easier
2012-03-29T19:05:00.000Z	ikonia	multiHYP	iptables support can be found in #netfilter
2012-03-29T19:05:00.000Z	ikonia	multiHYP	good luck in #netfilter,
2012-03-29T19:05:00.000Z	ikonia	multiHYP	well, if you don't think I know how to use iptables, that's your business, however it is stupid to assume I don't know how to use it because your pride is burnt
2012-03-29T19:06:00.000Z	multiHYP	ikonia	no, i assume because you didn't answer my question. you kept telling me to use ufw
2012-03-29T19:06:00.000Z	ikonia	multiHYP	I asked you once to consider using it, up to you
