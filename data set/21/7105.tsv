2006-11-28T09:08:00.000Z	reverseblade	eXp|Dwark^	peripherals like keyboard monitor are configured in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-11-28T09:08:00.000Z	reverseblade	eXp|Dwark^	I cannot say what exactly you should do, but e.g you want to disable your touch pad , you go there and add this: Option SetMaxTapTime 0 .
2006-11-28T09:09:00.000Z	reverseblade	eXp|Dwark^	I suggest you digg the forums and that file. also check out the log files
2006-11-28T09:09:00.000Z	eXp|Dwark^	reverseblade	ive tried to look at forums.. cant find an answer.. dont know how to disable my touchpad on a desktop pc.. hehe :P
2006-11-28T09:10:00.000Z	reverseblade	eXp|Dwark^	I assure you there is a solution for that unless your keyboard is broken
2006-11-28T09:12:00.000Z	eXp|Dwark^	reverseblade	im a linux noob.. hehe.. so im just doing it the easy way that i know works :D
2006-11-28T09:13:00.000Z	reverseblade	eXp|Dwark^	there is nothing wrong with that. some times it is better to know where to look rather than the where to find exact solution. If there is a solution for you it is in that file I have mentioned and prolly there is
2006-11-28T09:14:00.000Z	eXp|Dwark^	reverseblade	i just dont know where to vies the log files :) now im reparing a friends computer.. can you pm me? :) so i can remember what you say :D
