2007-05-18T06:38:00.000Z	sparr		short of running my own repository mirror and keeping a symlink updated, is there any way to always use the latest ubuntu packages without updating my sources every few months?
2007-05-18T06:38:00.000Z	Flannel	sparr	what?  The same repositories keep updated
2007-05-18T06:39:00.000Z	sparr	Flannel	i just had to switch from feisty to gutsy, and ill have to switch to hwhatever in 5-6 months
2007-05-18T06:39:00.000Z	Flannel	sparr	you just had to?  You know gutsy is pre-alpha, right?  You just keep upgrading to new versions every six months.
2007-05-18T06:40:00.000Z	sparr	Flannel	some of us cant wait 6 months for something that came out recently
2007-05-18T06:40:00.000Z	Flannel	sparr	gutsy isn't the way to go.  Personal you'd be better off with debian unstable instead of ubuntu.  Soemthig with rolling updates.
2007-05-18T06:41:00.000Z	sparr	Flannel	i moved from debian experimental/incoming to ubuntu, because ubuntu has better desktop integration.  it was a tough decision.
2007-05-18T06:41:00.000Z	Flannel	sparr	check that out, if you want specific things backported from newer versions.
2007-05-18T06:42:00.000Z	sparr	Flannel	if i wanted that much hassle i would have stuck with debian or gentoo
2007-05-18T06:42:00.000Z	Flannel	sparr	but really, ubuntu is a release based distro.  debian is much more suited for what you want.
2007-05-18T06:42:00.000Z	Flannel	sparr	There's *no* way to make ubuntu pretend to be a rolling distro.
2007-05-18T06:42:00.000Z	sparr	Flannel	im well aware of that.  ubuntu's integration *SLIGHTLY* trumps debian's packaging schedule.
2007-05-18T06:43:00.000Z	Flannel	sparr	then you'll just have to live with it.
2008-07-31T07:57:00.000Z	Flannel	sparr	#ubuntu-motu
2008-07-31T07:59:00.000Z	sparr	Flannel	screw that, it was patched in the last 9 months.  that is FAR less undeveloped than many packages
2008-07-31T08:00:00.000Z	Flannel	sparr	Decision to dropped it came before 1.2.11, 4 years had passed since 1.2.10, and that wasn't because it was bug free.
2008-11-03T06:07:00.000Z	Flannel	sparr	Mark it to be held in synaptic
2008-11-03T06:07:00.000Z	sparr	Flannel	mark what?
2008-11-03T06:08:00.000Z	Flannel	sparr	hmm, its trying to install? or upgrade those packages?
2008-11-03T06:08:00.000Z	sparr	Flannel	i upgraded all of my packages.  the problem is that one of the mythbuntu packages (i dont know which) messes with my login configuration
2008-11-03T06:09:00.000Z	Flannel	sparr	Ah, configuration.  I'm not sure.  You might try asking the mythbuntu people in #ubuntu-mythtv
