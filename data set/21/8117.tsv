2008-01-24T00:37:00.000Z	czr		bleh. wanted to /msg :-)
2008-01-24T00:38:00.000Z	MrObvious	czr	Ask your real question.
2008-01-24T00:38:00.000Z	czr	MrObvious	I have no question
2008-01-24T00:39:00.000Z	MrObvious	czr	Whoops wrong person sorry.
2008-01-24T00:39:00.000Z	czr	MrObvious	np :-).
2008-01-24T01:46:00.000Z	czr	MrObvious	you could always just buy motherboards with VIA chipsets
2008-01-24T01:47:00.000Z	MrObvious	czr	VIA chipsets suck for overclocking. A solid one would do better. For stock VIA is okay, but I prefer better quality hardware.
2008-01-24T01:47:00.000Z	czr	MrObvious	I never overclock and still run into hw bugs with VIAs ;-)
2008-01-24T01:47:00.000Z	czr	MrObvious	I was trying to be ironic ;-)
2008-01-24T01:48:00.000Z	MrObvious	czr	Iron?
2008-01-24T01:48:00.000Z	czr	MrObvious	yup. the principal ingridient of irony.
2008-01-24T01:48:00.000Z	MrObvious	czr	Ahh lol.
2008-01-24T01:59:00.000Z	MrObvious	czr	Which deb is errant?
2008-01-24T01:59:00.000Z	MrObvious	czr	I would see about fixing the errant package instead of forcing it.
2008-01-24T01:59:00.000Z	czr	MrObvious	err. I'm still doing the preseeding thing. after installing the system, update-manager says that there are 6 packages with security fixes. I want to apply them automatically while installing.
2008-01-24T02:00:00.000Z	MrObvious	czr	So you're doing an upgrade and have security fixes? Finish the upgrade first.
2008-01-24T03:07:00.000Z	MrObvious	czr	I got an idea. Settings -> Preferences -> Input Box -> Nick Completion Settings -> Last Spoke
2008-01-24T03:07:00.000Z	czr	MrObvious	too old xchat here :-)
2008-01-24T03:07:00.000Z	MrObvious	czr	Update then. :p
2008-01-24T03:08:00.000Z	czr	MrObvious	I'd rather have a stable system which is rock-solid, thank you.
2008-01-24T03:08:00.000Z	czr	MrObvious	I'll wait for hardy and do a clean reinstall
