2011-01-20T12:14:00.000Z	yuva	DasEi	thanks a lot
2011-01-20T12:31:00.000Z	yuva	DasEi	can se edit files in etc directly as in windows
2011-01-20T12:31:00.000Z	DasEi	yuva	yes, but systemfiles as in /etc have ownership of root, so call gedit with gksudo
2011-01-20T12:32:00.000Z	yuva	DasEi	so that we no need use termina.
2011-01-20T12:34:00.000Z	yuva	DasEi	plz help i am new to ubunru....
2011-01-20T12:34:00.000Z	DasEi	yuva	I do, but I didn't get your last question
2011-01-20T12:38:00.000Z	DasEi	yuva	as said, these files belong to root, so gksudo for graphical apps, sudo for terminal comands..
2011-01-20T12:40:00.000Z	DasEi	yuva	cp = copy, mv= move, rm = remove (delete)carefull with that if you are new to it, better do it graphically so it deletes to the bin, and not to unrevorable gone
2011-01-20T12:42:00.000Z	DasEi	yuva	for your purpose: gksudo nautilus, if you're a former win user and want it quick and simple
2011-01-20T12:44:00.000Z	DasEi	yuva	if you are so new to ubuntu, I wouldn't recommend drupal.. linux is fine, but one shouldn't take first lessons on driverlicense on a highway maybe, just an idea
2011-01-20T12:47:00.000Z	yuva	DasEi	for ma project i took it but i dont have time to chage now so..
2011-01-20T12:47:00.000Z	DasEi	yuva	how did you install  it ? from source or as deb ?
2011-01-20T12:52:00.000Z	yuva	DasEi	as a deb
2011-01-20T12:52:00.000Z	DasEi	yuva	so all dependencies should be fine then
