2007-11-27T16:35:00.000Z	NixPanther		Okies... Here is the issue I'm having with Ubuntu. I was using Fiesty, but after some problems and a HDD death (old hdd) I replaced the hdd with another and installed Gutsy. I clean installed from CD (Not upgraded from feisty) and I immediately had sound issues. CD's would play with sound mixer, but Flash was working only sporadically and video's in firefox wouldn't work (IE youtube). I have done all the gutsy upgrades since but I still have int
2007-11-27T16:35:00.000Z	NixPanther		ermittent sound issues. The more major issues I am having though are Crashes. My PC worked well under Dapper, ok under feisty and gutsy its terrible. It will crash at least 7 times in a day, If I'm Lucky. A lot of the times its when I am being graphics intensive with it, but sometimes it happens when I'm not doing anything at all. I have: AMD 2200+ nVidia 6800 and an NForce Soundcard. I have 1024 RAM.
2007-11-27T16:35:00.000Z	ikonia	NixPanther	1.) are you using ubuntu 7.10 64bit version 2.) what version of the flash plugin are you using
2007-11-27T16:38:00.000Z	NixPanther	ikonia	afaik Its 64 bit. Flash plugin ... *goes to check ff*
2007-11-27T16:38:00.000Z	ikonia	NixPanther	flash isn't availabe in 64bit, only a free version called "gnash" which is in early development and not very "stable" sites like youtube may have problems
2007-11-27T16:39:00.000Z	NixPanther	ikonia	about:plugind tells me - Shockwave Flash 9.0 r48
2007-11-27T16:39:00.000Z	ikonia	NixPanther	can you show me "uname -a"

2007-11-27T16:40:00.000Z	ikonia	NixPanther	ok, good so i's 32bit
2007-11-27T16:41:00.000Z	ikonia	NixPanther	are you having sound problems in general or just through ubuntu
2007-11-27T16:41:00.000Z	ikonia	NixPanther	or just through flash
2007-11-27T16:43:00.000Z	NixPanther	ikonia	Its mainly in Firefox, Sound Juicer works ok, but The mic also works sporadically. I play a game where I can use voice and sometimes the sound cuts out or goes really shakey in that too, and the mice doesn't work at all, but it works in skype.
2007-11-27T16:44:00.000Z	ikonia	NixPanther	I suspect thats not flash, its either 1.) a problem with your sound card/driver 2.) problems with sound when your machienn is under load
2007-11-27T16:49:00.000Z	NixPanther	ikonia	Thanks. I can root around the forums to try and sort out the sound issues. Do you have any Idea's on the crashes? (I'm not holding out a lot of hope on that one as I have read over 100 pages of forums where others are having the same issues)
2007-11-27T16:50:00.000Z	ikonia	NixPanther	what sound card are you using ?
2007-11-27T16:50:00.000Z	NixPanther	ikonia	Nforce2
2007-11-27T16:50:00.000Z	ikonia	NixPanther	no idea on that one, I know a few people complained about the driver on some intels
2007-11-27T16:51:00.000Z	ikonia	NixPanther	is your machine powerful ?
2007-11-27T16:51:00.000Z	NixPanther	ikonia	Yeah I have 2 options for that, either find the drivers again or take it our and use the on board sound.
2007-11-27T16:52:00.000Z	ikonia	NixPanther	I think the drivers in the kernel are mature enough
2007-11-27T16:54:00.000Z	NixPanther	ikonia	 Its an AMD athalon 2200, 1024 RAM
