2011-10-14T17:31:00.000Z	airtonix	andy	panel at the bottom? it's not supposed to show all your applications
2011-10-14T17:31:00.000Z	airtonix	andy	unless i'm mistaken it's like the notification area from gnome2
2011-10-14T17:32:00.000Z	andy	airtonix	ok I thought I may do as I saw other had that. (in screenshops), its got allarm clock and removable devices at the mo
2011-10-14T17:32:00.000Z	airtonix	andy	mind showing me the screenshot?
2011-10-14T17:33:00.000Z	airtonix	andy	is it cba123s screenshot?
2011-10-14T17:33:00.000Z	andy	airtonix	ill find one quick, not sure with your last question
2011-10-14T17:37:00.000Z	andy	airtonix	here are some screenshots http://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell/Screenshots the applications seem to be at the bottom right
2011-10-14T17:41:00.000Z	airtonix	andy	yeah that's the notification area
2011-10-14T17:41:00.000Z	andy	airtonix	what applications should appear there?
2011-10-14T17:41:00.000Z	airtonix	andy	there is in fact a gnome3 extension to have that positioned in the top right if you want
2011-10-14T17:42:00.000Z	airtonix	andy	typcially any application that has a notification icon
2011-10-14T17:42:00.000Z	andy	airtonix	I thought many of my applications would be down there but there not
2011-10-14T17:42:00.000Z	airtonix	andy	and i notice each empathy chat session with a user has an individual icon too
2011-10-14T17:43:00.000Z	andy	airtonix	i literally just have to applications down there and would like my chat one and some others like my music player
2011-10-14T17:43:00.000Z	airtonix	andy	you don't "put" applications there manually
2011-10-14T17:44:00.000Z	andy		airtonix,i thought I may need to setup notifications for certain apps
2011-10-14T17:45:00.000Z	andy	airtonix	lol. I will leave it then, thanks.
