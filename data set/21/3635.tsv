2008-11-22T04:30:00.000Z	finferflu		hey guys
2008-11-22T04:30:00.000Z	finferflu		i was trying to install 8.04 on a machine
2008-11-22T04:30:00.000Z	finferflu		but after choosing the language, the enter key doesn't work
2008-11-22T04:30:00.000Z	finferflu		so I can't proceed with the installation
2008-11-22T04:30:00.000Z	finferflu		any ideas?
2008-11-22T04:31:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	finferflu	and the keypad enter?
2008-11-22T04:31:00.000Z	finferflu	zsquareplusc	same thing
2008-11-22T04:32:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	finferflu	you have selected your keyboard or do you want an other?
2008-11-22T04:33:00.000Z	finferflu	zsquareplusc	no, it's the keyboard I want to use, I mean it's just the first screen before starting the liveCD
2008-11-22T04:34:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	finferflu	ha, there. hm. maybe it hangs. i've seen PC's with problems using these menus. things you could do is: 1) check the CD 2) try again 3) install with default, change language later
2008-11-22T04:35:00.000Z	finferflu	zsquareplusc	well, the odd thing is that the arrow keys work. I have tried with different languages, and it still fails
2008-11-22T04:36:00.000Z	finferflu	zsquareplusc	also, the fact that Enter works for selecting the language and stops working right after that is very odd
2008-11-22T04:36:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	finferflu	and <TAB>? it should start the line editor. maybe is enter working there
2008-11-22T04:37:00.000Z	finferflu	zsquareplusc	what to after pressing TAB?
2008-11-22T04:37:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	finferflu	enter :-)
2008-11-22T04:37:00.000Z	finferflu	zsquareplusc	so what does TAB do?
2008-11-22T04:37:00.000Z	finferflu	zsquareplusc	I think I didn't get it
2008-11-22T04:39:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	finferflu	well, maybe TAB isnt working with that menu type. the isolinux/syslinux stuff has grown many options and menu stlyes.. if enter isnt working i'd try booting with the default and set the language later. the installer will ask you anyways
2008-11-22T04:40:00.000Z	finferflu	zsquareplusc	yeah, I tried with default, but no joy, however I still have to see what TAB achieves :P
2008-11-22T04:41:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	finferflu	it should show the kernel/parameter line and allow to edit that line. but maybe that fetaure is not possible with the menu on the cd
2008-11-22T04:42:00.000Z	finferflu	zsquareplusc	alright, thanks for that, I will try, else I will burn a new cd and see how it goes. Have a nice day :)
