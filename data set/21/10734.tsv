2004-12-03T09:29:00.000Z	natex	bigtony	if you have samba installed you can use smbmount
2004-12-03T09:29:00.000Z	bigtony	natex	i'm hearing you and thanks
2004-12-03T09:29:00.000Z	bigtony		the thing is i have used smbmount and it doesn't work cause of the ntfs drive
2004-12-03T09:29:00.000Z	bigtony		yes i did
2004-12-03T09:30:00.000Z	bigtony		and your right if you let it set for a while you see the network
2004-12-03T09:30:00.000Z	natex	bigtony	so the ntfs is a drive on the linux box?
