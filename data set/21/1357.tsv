2011-02-01T11:33:00.000Z	KM0201	kaushal	dunno, try running sudo apt-get update, sudo apt-get upgrade
2011-02-01T11:34:00.000Z	KM0201	kaushal	you got something wrong there in your source list for sure.
2011-04-16T07:02:00.000Z	KM0201	kaushal	no, its not.
2011-04-16T07:10:00.000Z	KM0201	kaushal	understand what?
2011-04-16T07:11:00.000Z	kaushal	KM0201	about Unity ?
2011-04-16T07:11:00.000Z	KM0201	kaushal	what do you not understand?
2011-04-16T07:11:00.000Z	kaushal	KM0201	whats the default desktop in Ubuntu 11.04 ?
2011-04-16T07:12:00.000Z	KM0201	kaushal	default, is Unity.. however, ubuntu classic is also part of the default install.. if you have Natty questionjs, ask them in the natty channel.
2011-04-16T07:12:00.000Z	kaushal	KM0201	natty channel ?
2011-07-01T04:44:00.000Z	KM0201	kaushal	there's a PPA for it i'm pretty sure.
2011-07-01T04:45:00.000Z	kaushal	KM0201	is PPA Safe for production system ?
2011-07-01T04:45:00.000Z	KM0201	kaushal	not really, because the PPA is beta, and it's a daily build... so.. it's still in testing (as far as i know)
2011-07-01T04:45:00.000Z	KM0201	kaushal	if the PPA contains a final build, then yes, it should be safe.. but i'm pretty sure 5.0 is still beta
2011-07-01T04:51:00.000Z	kaushal	KM0201	also is there a way to know when the final build is going to be released in PPA ?
2011-07-01T04:52:00.000Z	KM0201	kaushal	it looks liek that repo you were linked to earlier, has the final release.. i just installed it no problem
