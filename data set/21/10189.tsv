2005-11-09T13:46:00.000Z	stas		NOTHING works
2005-11-09T13:47:00.000Z	onkarshinde	stas	How did you try to upgrade?
2005-11-09T13:47:00.000Z	onkarshinde	stas	Then what?
2005-11-09T13:48:00.000Z	onkarshinde	stas	You should have read the upgrade notes first.
2005-11-09T13:48:00.000Z	onkarshinde	stas	What happens then?
2005-11-09T13:49:00.000Z	onkarshinde	stas	Can you login?
2005-11-09T13:51:00.000Z	onkarshinde	stas	Open root terminal from applications->System tools and issue a command dpkg-reconfigure ubuntu-desktop. This will require a long time.
2005-11-09T13:51:00.000Z	onkarshinde	stas	Your system wide settings may be lost. But user data and settings will be preserved.
2005-11-09T13:54:00.000Z	onkarshinde	stas	just press Alt+F2 and then gnome-terminal
2005-11-09T13:56:00.000Z	onkarshinde	stas	sudo dpkg-reconfigure ubuntu-desktop
2005-11-09T13:58:00.000Z	stas	onkarshinde	I did!!
2005-11-09T13:58:00.000Z	onkarshinde	stas	Is it showing any progress?
2005-11-09T14:02:00.000Z	stas	onkarshinde	it finished instantly
2005-11-09T14:02:00.000Z	onkarshinde	stas	Are there any packages yet to be upgraded?
2005-11-09T14:04:00.000Z	onkarshinde	stas	Try 'apt-get update' and then 'apt-get dist-upgrade' once
2005-11-09T14:07:00.000Z	stas	onkarshinde	stas@spitfire:~$ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2005-11-09T14:08:00.000Z	onkarshinde	stas	I don't understand why everything is a mess.
2005-11-09T14:11:00.000Z	onkarshinde	stas	May be try forums stating exactly what you did.
