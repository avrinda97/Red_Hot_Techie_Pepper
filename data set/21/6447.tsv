2007-04-28T16:18:00.000Z	anvo		...reinstalling it shows up the same activation info I entered before uninstalling it!!!
2007-04-28T16:19:00.000Z	anvo		I remove the programe folders!
2007-04-28T16:19:00.000Z	anvo		But even so, reinstalling the app shows up the info I entered previously!
2007-04-28T16:20:00.000Z	anvo		No, because
2007-04-28T16:20:00.000Z	anvo		because I installed it from CD!
2007-04-28T16:20:00.000Z	jrib	anvo	what program?
2007-04-28T16:17:00.000Z	jrib	anvo	ubuntu doesn't have a registry.  What do you mean?
2007-04-28T16:18:00.000Z	jrib	anvo	yes?
2007-04-28T16:20:00.000Z	jrib	anvo	what is the name of the package?
2007-04-28T16:21:00.000Z	jrib	anvo	you installed this using APT?
2007-04-28T16:24:00.000Z	jrib	anvo	you still haven't told us the name of the package
2007-04-28T16:25:00.000Z	jrib	anvo	there's no "mgde" or "Magenta" package turning up at packages.ubuntu.com
2007-04-28T16:26:00.000Z	anvo	jrib	it's not in the repo's!
2007-04-28T16:27:00.000Z	jrib	anvo	I see
2007-04-28T16:27:00.000Z	jrib	anvo	but you are installing it from some other repository?
2007-04-28T16:28:00.000Z	jrib	anvo	is it a .deb package?
2007-04-28T16:30:00.000Z	jrib	anvo	k well if you deleted your private config files that start with a '.' in your HOME for the program, then maybe the deb package has a mistake and APT doesn't delete all the config files it uses when you purge
