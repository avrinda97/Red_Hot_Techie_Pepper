2010-10-30T19:12:00.000Z	chrissharp123		I don't have the low volume/garbled issue, but the skipping is maddening - I don't listen to music on my PC anymore :-(

2010-10-30T19:14:00.000Z	asad-ahmad	chrissharp123	I have Intel HDA chipset as well, and I had some problems on Karmic, but not anymore in Lucid
2010-10-30T19:14:00.000Z	asad-ahmad	chrissharp123	Did you change any default settings?.
2010-10-30T19:14:00.000Z	chrissharp123	asad-ahmad	nope
2010-10-30T19:16:00.000Z	asad-ahmad	chrissharp123	Have you tried removing Pulse all together and then try ALSA? and vice versa?.
2010-10-30T19:16:00.000Z	chrissharp123	asad-ahmad	that's my next step
2010-10-30T19:17:00.000Z	asad-ahmad	chrissharp123	Just the music playing is messy, or the startup sound as well?
2010-10-30T19:17:00.000Z	chrissharp123	asad-ahmad	startup sound is often garbled, yes
2010-10-30T19:19:00.000Z	asad-ahmad	chrissharp123	That is the same thing I get on Karmic. I messed up some settings in there trying to get 4.1 working via getting output from the Mic channel.
2010-10-30T19:19:00.000Z	asad-ahmad	chrissharp123	Which motherboard?
2010-10-30T19:21:00.000Z	chrissharp123	asad-ahmad	Gigabyte 870A UD3
2010-10-30T19:22:00.000Z	chrissharp123	asad-ahmad	I followed the debugging instructions at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingSoundProblems
2010-10-30T19:22:00.000Z	chrissharp123	asad-ahmad	and it worked on ALSA fine but was stuttery on pulse
2010-10-30T19:27:00.000Z	chrissharp123	asad-ahmad	I just removed pulseaudio* and sound is working much better - funny - I've been doing all these workarounds but had not tried that simple solution :-)
2010-10-30T19:29:00.000Z	asad-ahmad	chrissharp123	If you still think it could be a bit better, try updating ALSA as stated in http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=6589810
2010-10-30T19:30:00.000Z	chrissharp123	asad-ahmad	thanks!
2010-10-30T19:30:00.000Z	asad-ahmad	chrissharp123	I am glad you have most of it sorted. Having pulse and ALSA both will definitely mess stuff up.
2010-10-30T19:30:00.000Z	asad-ahmad	chrissharp123	My pleasure. I wasn't of much help to be honest
