2006-01-28T13:10:00.000Z	Candyman		yep, no problem
2006-01-28T13:10:00.000Z	Candyman		hope it works for you
2006-01-28T13:12:00.000Z	Candyman		hmmmm...that's weird
2006-01-28T13:13:00.000Z	Candyman		I hear they have packages for a lot of those
2006-01-28T13:13:00.000Z	Candyman		...but then again, if you're going to game heavily you don't really want to be using Linux
2006-01-28T13:13:00.000Z	Candyman		I use 2k4 in Ubuntu, also
2006-01-28T13:14:00.000Z	Candyman		hehe
2006-01-28T13:14:00.000Z	mitrovarr	Candyman	 Do you have the problem that it fails to run if your desktop is in a lower res than the game is set to?
2006-01-28T13:14:00.000Z	mitrovarr	Candyman	 like if I set it to 1600x1200 and my desktop is 1024x768 it won't run.  It's easily worked around, but annoying.
2006-01-28T13:14:00.000Z	Candyman	mitrovarr	never tried it...don't get good enough framerates to bother with 2k4
2006-01-28T13:16:00.000Z	Candyman	mitrovarr	Actually, I apparently can't select any resolutions higher than my desktop rez to run it at
2006-01-28T13:17:00.000Z	Candyman	mitrovarr	...either that or it just doesn't want to run in 1600x1200 at all
2006-01-28T13:17:00.000Z	mitrovarr	Candyman	 Oh yeah, that too.  You have to set your desktop higher, than set the game higher, than drop the desktop to make it not run.  I forgot about that.
2006-01-28T13:17:00.000Z	Candyman	mitrovarr	Well then don't do that. :-P
2006-01-28T13:17:00.000Z	mitrovarr	Candyman	 it's obnoxious, because I run the gave at 1600x1200 (good video card) but my desktop at 1024x768 (don't wanna go blind)
2006-01-28T13:17:00.000Z	Candyman	mitrovarr	You can turn up the font sizes ;-)
2006-01-28T13:18:00.000Z	mitrovarr	Candyman	 I've tried that, and DPI settings, websites just don't implement them well enough to work
2006-01-28T13:18:00.000Z	Candyman	mitrovarr	ahhhh...fair enough
2006-01-28T13:18:00.000Z	Candyman	mitrovarr	Cedega?
2006-01-28T13:19:00.000Z	mitrovarr	Candyman	 last I checked it didn't work right
2006-01-28T13:19:00.000Z	mitrovarr	Candyman	 I haven't tested it, although after MUCH MUCH effort I FINALLY got Cedega to compile from CVS.
