2010-06-20T03:58:00.000Z	gogeta	lakitu	i would go with 4 to 6 gb then
2010-06-20T03:58:00.000Z	lakitu		thanks
2010-06-20T03:58:00.000Z	gogeta	lakitu	so you have a little app space for anything you need to install to fix windpws
2010-06-20T03:59:00.000Z	gogeta	lakitu	or you can just stick to the live cd for when you need it and not install anything
2010-06-20T03:59:00.000Z	lakitu	gogeta	it's for a friend, i'm not sure he's that handy, e.g. to install a new 7z fileroller, etc
2010-06-20T03:59:00.000Z	lakitu		or whatever it's called
2010-06-20T04:00:00.000Z	gogeta	lakitu	i would go with 4 to 6 gb install what you need and leave it there
2010-06-20T04:00:00.000Z	lakitu		so i'm gonna have it pre set up, for in case (or for WHEN) Window$ crashes
2010-06-20T04:00:00.000Z	gogeta	lakitu	6 gb would give you plenty of room
