2007-06-09T15:42:00.000Z	esperegu		How can I add a menu? So that I will have 'Applications - Places - System - MYMENU'
2007-06-09T15:42:00.000Z	ccooke	esperegu	Right click on the menu, choose "edit menu"
2007-06-09T15:43:00.000Z	esperegu	ccooke	I can then add items to 'Applications' and 'System' but pressing 'New Menu' adds a menu below 'Applications' while I want it on the same level
2007-06-09T15:44:00.000Z	ccooke	esperegu	Ah. That I don't *think* is so easy
2007-06-09T15:45:00.000Z	esperegu	ccooke	it should be... I tried to add a custom menu to the panel but then I get the same menu twice.
2007-06-09T15:47:00.000Z	ccooke	esperegu	I don't think Gnome supports that without a seperate application to make the extra menu
2007-06-09T15:48:00.000Z	ccooke	esperegu	there *is* something you can do, though
2007-06-09T15:48:00.000Z	ccooke	esperegu	If you right click on the panel, select "add to panel"
2007-06-09T15:48:00.000Z	ccooke	esperegu	choose the Drawer option
2007-06-09T15:48:00.000Z	esperegu	ccooke	I have that.
2007-06-09T15:48:00.000Z	ccooke	esperegu	Right.
2007-06-09T15:48:00.000Z	ccooke	esperegu	I think that's the best you can do.
2007-06-09T15:49:00.000Z	esperegu		but then I can't seem to get a text next to the icons in that
2007-06-09T15:49:00.000Z	esperegu	ccooke	is it posible that the drawer shows the name next to the icon?
2007-06-09T15:49:00.000Z	ccooke	esperegu	I suspect if it can, it'll be a per-icon setting
2007-06-09T15:50:00.000Z	ccooke	esperegu	it's just another type of panel - some of the things that are added to the panel can display as text instead (or in addition) to icons
2007-06-09T15:50:00.000Z	esperegu	ccooke	any chance u know how? I did not seem to get it done (that's why I switched to menu)
2007-06-09T15:51:00.000Z	ccooke	esperegu	it's an option on the individual icons, not on the drawer.
2007-06-09T15:51:00.000Z	ccooke	esperegu	and not all will have it
2007-06-09T15:51:00.000Z	ccooke	esperegu	basically, it's unlikely it'll do what you want.
2007-06-09T15:51:00.000Z	esperegu	ccooke	:-(
