2009-10-19T14:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lucent	i'd say smart, rather than lazy :)
2010-10-21T11:06:00.000Z	lucent	ActionParsnip	pro-tip 'gksudo -- nautilus --browser'
2010-11-15T13:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lucent	sudo lshw -C network ,will tell you
2010-11-15T13:08:00.000Z	lucent	ActionParsnip	...
2010-11-15T13:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lucent	if you run the command it will display information about all attached network interfaces including chip
2010-11-15T13:09:00.000Z	lucent	ActionParsnip	we're speaking of a hypothetical laptop, so while your advice is sound it is also funny and not applying to the discussion
2010-11-15T13:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lucent	why funny?
2010-11-15T13:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lucent	I get what you mean with the hypothetical bit
2010-11-17T10:23:00.000Z	lucent	ActionParsnip	he's from the distant future
2010-11-17T10:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lucent	very distant indeed
2010-11-17T11:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lucent	it's not there is 1-2-3 app from pendrielinux for windows or unetbootin for both ubuntu and windows
2010-11-17T11:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lucent	not hard in any way
2010-11-17T11:28:00.000Z	lucent	ActionParsnip	syslinux is poofed, I've tried Unetbootin and the Ubuntu image creator, both do it wrong
2010-11-17T11:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lucent	tried pendrive linux 1-2-3 app?
2010-11-17T11:29:00.000Z	lucent	ActionParsnip	no, it was not suggested to me by Ubuntu docs to try pendrive linux 1-2-3 app
2010-11-17T11:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lucent	its a windows app and can downloaded the iso for you and MD5 test all in one, its nifty :)
2010-11-17T11:30:00.000Z	lucent	ActionParsnip	I'll remember that next time I have access to Windows ? :)
2010-11-17T11:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lucent	ok, if you have network access the run: sudo apt-get --reinstall install usb-creator usb-creator-gtk   so its the latest one then use that
2010-11-17T11:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lucent	nice
2010-11-17T11:41:00.000Z	lucent	ActionParsnip	I'd guess that it's set when you mount NTFS to disallow executing programs from that mountpoint? not the permissions issue
