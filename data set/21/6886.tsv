2007-02-13T08:30:00.000Z	ummagumma		daveyarusso>> excuse guy, but did you try wvdial?!
2007-02-13T08:31:00.000Z	daveyarusso	ummagumma	Yes.  wvdial actually does some strange things as well, which is probably related.  It asks for a password on two different occasions, and on the second, hangs.  If the pw is provided in the conf file, it connects, then drops it, and hangs later.
2007-02-13T08:32:00.000Z	ummagumma		what modem you use?!
2007-02-13T08:32:00.000Z	daveyarusso	ummagumma	It's the internal winmodem on a Dell Inspiron 5100.  Not sure what the exact modem is offhand.
2007-02-13T08:33:00.000Z	ummagumma		well, i think this modem have support from the driver, otherwise you cannot connect
2007-02-13T08:34:00.000Z	ummagumma		my modem is a hsp56mr...
2007-02-13T08:34:00.000Z	ummagumma		but it works!
2007-02-13T08:35:00.000Z	daveyarusso	ummagumma	Yeah, the driver should be fine, since it does actually dial and such, and it does connect via the network-admin (I'm on this machine atm actually).  In short, I need to find out what configuration options are being sent when doing the n-a method so I can compare them to my wvdial.conf.
2007-02-13T08:35:00.000Z	ummagumma		ok, that's all to do
2007-02-13T08:37:00.000Z	daveyarusso	ummagumma	Do you happen to know what command the "Enable" button runs?  If I can do that directly from a terminal I'll be able to see the exact output.
2007-02-13T08:38:00.000Z	ummagumma		i just type "wvdial" on a ternimal section, and all the commands are displayed
2007-02-13T08:38:00.000Z	ummagumma		your connection is tone or pulse based?!
2007-02-13T08:40:00.000Z	daveyarusso	ummagumma	Not sure about tone or pulse.  And yes, running wvdial in a terminal will show all of the commands, but it doesn't work.  The other thing works, but I don't know what it's doing.
2007-02-13T08:41:00.000Z	ummagumma		maybe your wvdial config file is wrong, about the tone or pulse option
2007-02-13T08:42:00.000Z	ummagumma		to know what type connection you have, ypu can look at your phone device, try to look
2007-02-13T08:42:00.000Z	ummagumma		these configs are important
2007-02-13T08:42:00.000Z	daveyarusso	ummagumma	I'll try swapping that.  Since obviously this requires disconnecting to futz with, any other things I should try while I'm at it?
2007-02-13T08:43:00.000Z	daveyarusso	ummagumma	What do you mean by look at your phone device?
2007-02-13T08:43:00.000Z	ummagumma		excuse, i mean you may look to your phone
2007-02-13T08:45:00.000Z	ummagumma	daveyarusso	find something?
2007-02-13T08:46:00.000Z	daveyarusso	ummagumma	Not really.  Looking at some possibly relevant wiki pages while I'm connected to see if there's anything enlightening.
