2006-08-03T12:01:00.000Z	django_	pwnedomina	get the straight xchat
2006-08-03T12:03:00.000Z	django_	pwnedomina	actually fluxbox is better, which is what i use on my FreeBSD boxes :)
2006-08-03T12:10:00.000Z	django_	pwnedomina	yes
2006-08-03T12:14:00.000Z	django_	pwnedomina	you should be able to install it via the package manager, no?
2006-08-03T12:14:00.000Z	django_	pwnedomina	if i was you, at your skill level, i would try to get the package installed
2006-08-03T12:14:00.000Z	django_	pwnedomina	find a repository with the package
2006-08-03T12:15:00.000Z	django_	pwnedomina	problem is, lots of things get installed when you install nessus. If you want to remove them all later, best not to install the source
2006-08-03T12:15:00.000Z	django_	pwnedomina	heh ok told
2006-08-03T12:16:00.000Z	django_	pwnedomina	well the gui has to be somewhere ... luckily in FreeBSD i just type 'make install clean' in the nessus port folder ;)
2006-08-03T12:16:00.000Z	django_	pwnedomina	try installing it and see if they are all there
2006-08-03T12:17:00.000Z	django_	pwnedomina	sorry nessusd
