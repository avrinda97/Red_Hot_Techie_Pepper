2005-04-17T06:17:00.000Z	sommers	Arnia	ok
2005-04-17T06:21:00.000Z	sommers	Arnia	the latest hoary Cd. i downloaded it yesterday.
2005-04-17T06:24:00.000Z	sommers	Arnia	when did you install?
2005-04-17T06:25:00.000Z	Arnia	sommers	About two months ago...
2005-04-17T06:25:00.000Z	sommers	Arnia	:(
2005-04-17T06:25:00.000Z	Arnia	sommers	Dunno why the message has changed... maybe they've forgotten to edit the deb installer text in one area :)
2005-04-17T06:25:00.000Z	sommers	Arnia	ok.
2005-04-17T06:47:00.000Z	Arnia	sommers	Oooh! Did you drop into the advanced installer?
2005-04-17T06:47:00.000Z	sommers	Arnia	yes
2005-04-17T06:47:00.000Z	Arnia	sommers	That explains it... I should file a bug about that for Breezy
2005-04-17T06:47:00.000Z	sommers	Arnia	oh. i did'nt know auto install and expert install were that different :(
2005-04-17T06:48:00.000Z	Arnia	sommers	expert install is very close to the original debian installer I believe
2005-04-17T06:48:00.000Z	Arnia	sommers	It really is an expert install
2005-04-17T06:53:00.000Z	Arnia	sommers	gtk2 is a lot faster now
2005-04-17T06:53:00.000Z	Arnia	sommers	Should be even faster once its hardware accelerated
2005-04-17T06:53:00.000Z	sommers	Arnia	no idea. i dont even know how slow it was earlier :D
2005-04-17T06:54:00.000Z	Arnia	sommers	gnome-look.org, art.gnome.org
