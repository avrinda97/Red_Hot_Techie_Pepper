2008-02-23T11:58:00.000Z	saff		hey all, i've been messing around with my vid drivers and xorg.conf file today, and i just realized that NO videos are playing... trying vlc and mplayer... just get a screen of green static, with sound
2008-02-23T11:59:00.000Z	saff		does that sound familiar to anyone?
2008-02-23T11:59:00.000Z	saff		they were working fine yesterday
2008-02-23T11:59:00.000Z	bazhang	saff	what happened in the meantime
2008-02-23T11:59:00.000Z	saff	bazhang	i've reinstalled my nvidia prop drivers many, many times
2008-02-23T12:01:00.000Z	bazhang	saff	when you say 'different methods' what would those be?
2008-02-23T12:02:00.000Z	saff	bazhang	the ubuntu restricted manager, envy, and by hand
2008-02-23T12:02:00.000Z	saff	bazhang	i've been trying to get my drivers working properly... i thought i was back at square one till i noticed this video problem
2008-02-23T12:03:00.000Z	bazhang	saff	and then you removed the previous ones before installing subsequently? care to pastebin your xorg-conf?
2008-02-23T12:03:00.000Z	saff	bazhang	http://pastebin.org/20853
2008-02-23T12:06:00.000Z	saff	bazhang	any ideas general?
2008-02-23T12:07:00.000Z	bazhang	saff	just a moment, looking at my xorg.conf ;]
2008-02-23T12:08:00.000Z	saff	bazhang	sure thing professor, i've got all night
2008-02-23T12:21:00.000Z	saff	bazhang	glx is the only module you load?
2008-02-23T12:21:00.000Z	bazhang	saff	aye
2008-02-23T12:22:00.000Z	bazhang	saff	it seems that there are some 'leftovers' from what ever envy did
2008-02-23T12:22:00.000Z	saff	bazhang	no, envy didnt touch my xorg.conf
2008-02-23T12:23:00.000Z	bazhang	saff	well there are just a ton of modules in yours; that eludes me how they got there
2008-02-23T12:24:00.000Z	bazhang	saff	yeah might be that as well
2008-02-23T12:32:00.000Z	bazhang	saff	and win32codecs from medibuntu in there as well?
2008-02-23T12:33:00.000Z	saff	bazhang	yea both.. like i said, it was working even a few hours ago
