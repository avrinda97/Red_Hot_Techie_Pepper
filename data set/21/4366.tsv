2010-02-18T06:58:00.000Z	Freeaqingme		Looking at the US Dvorak layout, there 4 symbols on some keys. How can I use the ones that dont show when I hit a normal key or use shift?
2010-02-18T06:58:00.000Z	jrib	Freeaqingme	which ones exactly?
2010-02-18T07:03:00.000Z	Freeaqingme	jrib	stuff like: รก and
2010-02-18T07:03:00.000Z	jrib	Freeaqingme	you probably need AltGr (you can set one up in layout preferences)
2010-02-18T07:08:00.000Z	Freeaqingme	jrib	works like a charm, tnx
2010-04-30T19:56:00.000Z	jrib	Freeaqingme	I don't know anything about the netbook edition, but I'll try to help.  Do you know if it uses the same repositories as ubuntu?
2010-04-30T19:58:00.000Z	Freeaqingme	jrib	unsure, let me see
2010-04-30T19:58:00.000Z	jrib	Freeaqingme	if it does, then we can probably just use the minimal iso and then grab the right package for netbook remix
2010-04-30T19:59:00.000Z	Freeaqingme	jrib	looks like there's no such thing distributed by ubuntu?
2010-04-30T20:00:00.000Z	jrib	Freeaqingme	the minimal, you mean?
2010-04-30T20:00:00.000Z	jrib	Freeaqingme	here's the minimal iso: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD  I just don't know how to get you to unr once you have a minimal install
2010-04-30T20:01:00.000Z	Freeaqingme	jrib	tnx. Though what's 'unr'?
2010-04-30T20:01:00.000Z	jrib	Freeaqingme	that's the acronym I've seen for Ubuntu Netbook Remix
2010-04-30T20:02:00.000Z	Freeaqingme	jrib	ah, sorry. I was hoping it's just a matter of switching desktop manager
2010-04-30T20:02:00.000Z	jrib	Freeaqingme	I'm not actually sure.  I'm looking for some docs and my guess is you are right; it is that simple
2010-04-30T20:03:00.000Z	Freeaqingme	jrib	I'm trying to find those dox as well. you dont happen to know what window manager that would be?
2010-04-30T20:04:00.000Z	jrib	Freeaqingme	I'm starting here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UNR
2010-04-30T20:08:00.000Z	jrib	Freeaqingme	looks like the package is just "ubuntu-netbook-remix".  So if you install minimal ubuntu and then install that, you should be good to go.  Make sense?
2010-04-30T20:08:00.000Z	Freeaqingme	jrib	definitely, tnx
2010-08-30T06:03:00.000Z	jrib	Freeaqingme	cpuburn
