2005-08-03T09:42:00.000Z	faen		aloha everyone
2005-08-03T09:43:00.000Z	faen		just switched from mandriva, have to re-learn linux now
2005-08-03T09:44:00.000Z	faen		just made fresh install of hoary, what firewall if any is used, and where is the security config type stuff?
2005-08-03T09:45:00.000Z	thoreauputic	faen	a default install of hoary doesn't need a firewall ( no services are enabled to the internet)
2005-08-03T09:46:00.000Z	faen	thoreauputic	I see, I would like to run ssh, and a small ircd and a few other little items, what is a good selection for debian/ubuntu firewall
2005-08-03T09:47:00.000Z	thoreauputic	faen	firestarter is a nice gui for configuring iptables
2005-08-03T09:49:00.000Z	thoreauputic	faen	see ubotu's URL
2005-08-03T09:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic	faen	you need the universe repository
2005-08-03T09:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic	faen	^^^
2005-08-03T10:21:00.000Z	thoreauputic	faen	read the restricted formats URL below
2005-08-03T11:02:00.000Z	thoreauputic	faen	I came to Ubuntu via Mandrake, Knoppix and Debian - once you "get" it you won't feel that way any more
2005-08-03T11:03:00.000Z	faen	thoreauputic	it would be nice got get a grasp on things as I need to get my servers up & running again shortly
2005-08-03T11:04:00.000Z	thoreauputic	faen	I suggest " sudo apt-get apt-howto" unless you are familiar with apt already
2005-08-03T11:04:00.000Z	thoreauputic	faen	oops sudo apt-get install
2005-08-03T11:05:00.000Z	faen	thoreauputic	i used apt every-so-often with mandrake 10.01 & greater
2005-08-03T11:05:00.000Z	thoreauputic	faen	OK :)
2005-08-03T11:05:00.000Z	thoreauputic	faen	IMO dpkg and apt are the keys to Ubuntu/Debian
2005-08-05T08:02:00.000Z	thoreauputic	faen	try /media/cdrom
2005-08-05T08:03:00.000Z	thoreauputic	faen	erm - what are you trying to mount? What is on the CD ?
2005-08-05T08:03:00.000Z	thoreauputic	faen	you don't need to mount to burn an ISO
2005-08-05T08:04:00.000Z	thoreauputic	faen	try sudo eject /dev/cdrom
