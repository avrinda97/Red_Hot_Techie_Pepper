2005-04-03T07:35:00.000Z	robertj_	dross	there monitors are above average and a 17" float panel + any new machine with 512 megs of ram is a good deal for $500
2005-04-03T07:35:00.000Z	dross	robertj_	depends on the hardware
2005-04-03T07:35:00.000Z	dross	robertj_	doesn't matter the price, you need to learn more about computers

2005-04-03T07:41:00.000Z	robertj_	dross	don't cry for me, I'm the one who buys all the stuff at work "cheap" and I'm going to buy myself a very nice G5 with some very nice monitors and a very nice kvm and a very cheap dell to sit beside my desk on the kvm
