2009-05-23T00:34:00.000Z	Core8		hi can you guys help me? I'm trying to install the fglrx drivers on this system (I'm on it now) but everytime I install them X crashes upon booting, and I have to remove them using sudo apt-get remove fglrx* before I can reboot my system again...
2009-05-23T00:35:00.000Z	Core8		I'm also not able to install the driver using the Restricted Drivers Manager, but I have been able to before on the same system in the past.
2009-05-23T00:36:00.000Z	Core8		tanner -- try with sudo cp
2009-05-23T00:36:00.000Z	Core8		or maybe use sudo nautilus if you need to use the gui
2009-05-23T00:37:00.000Z	Core8		anyone there that can help me with my graphic driver problem?
2009-05-23T00:38:00.000Z	Core8		tanner -- open terminal, and type sudo nautilus, press enter. you should have root permissions in the windows that pops up;
2009-05-23T00:39:00.000Z	Core8		irssi is much better than pidgin IMHO
2009-05-23T00:39:00.000Z	Core8		?
2009-05-23T00:40:00.000Z	Core8		I need to get proprietary ATI drivers to work with my card.
2009-05-23T00:40:00.000Z	Core8		They used to work in the past, but they stopped working after updating and installing software, and I need to get this fixed.

2009-05-23T00:41:00.000Z	JKemp	Core8	& i assume your using Jaunty ??
2009-05-23T00:44:00.000Z	JKemp	Core8	Will propreitary drivers not load ?
2009-05-23T00:46:00.000Z	Core8	JKemp	-- proprietary drivers wont load anymore... after I installed a lot of packages and updated the system...
2009-05-23T00:48:00.000Z	JKemp	Core8	Did the updates include a kernel package??
2009-05-23T00:48:00.000Z	Core8	JKemp	-- I updated the kernel, yeah.
2009-05-23T00:48:00.000Z	JKemp	Core8	I usually get problems with drivers and settings ALOT when upgrade to newr kernel.. etc.
2009-05-23T00:49:00.000Z	JKemp	Core8	So did it happen after installing updateing kernel ?
2009-05-23T00:50:00.000Z	JKemp	Core8	Hmm.. do you still have outdated kernel in your grub boot up list ?
2009-05-23T00:50:00.000Z	JKemp	Core8	If so try booting up with outdated kernel and see if it works fine, then you know the cause of it anyways...
2009-05-23T00:50:00.000Z	Core8	JKemp	-- i'm gonna reinstall the driver and try old kernel...
