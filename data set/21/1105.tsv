2011-04-19T13:21:00.000Z	shomon		is it possible to cut and paste directly into virtualbox from ubuntu 10.10?
2011-04-19T13:23:00.000Z	shomon		songbird? not sure about the web ui but it's xul?
2011-04-19T13:24:00.000Z	shomon		sorry no, then. But I'm sure there must be many. I used a couple of curses based ones years back that had web uis
2011-04-19T13:26:00.000Z	shomon		does ubuntu allow for more support of the traditional X way of cut paste & copy?
2011-04-19T13:26:00.000Z	shomon		middle button pasting I mean
2011-04-19T13:27:00.000Z	ThinkT510	shomon	i can middle button paste, justt highlight what you want to paste
2011-04-19T13:28:00.000Z	shomon	ThinkT510	I can do it in most places, but for example not in open office and a few other places
2011-04-19T13:30:00.000Z	ThinkT510	shomon	works for me in libreoffice (though i am on arch)
2011-04-19T13:31:00.000Z	ThinkT510	shomon	works in xubuntu with openoffice too
2011-04-19T14:33:00.000Z	ThinkT510	shomon	tried installing the guest additions?
2011-04-19T14:34:00.000Z	shomon	ThinkT510	yes, but it made my screen look a tad inflated
2011-04-19T14:35:00.000Z	ThinkT510	shomon	there should be a screen resolution setting somewhere in ubuntu (sorry not sure where, i use xubuntu)
2011-04-19T14:36:00.000Z	ThinkT510	shomon	i thought you were running ubuntu inside virtualbox?
2011-04-19T14:38:00.000Z	shomon	ThinkT510	no the other way around
2011-04-19T14:38:00.000Z	ThinkT510	shomon	what vm is it?
2011-04-19T14:39:00.000Z	ThinkT510	shomon	then change the screen resolution within xp (think of the vbox window as xp's monitor)
2011-04-19T14:40:00.000Z	ThinkT510	shomon	you sure you installed the guest additions and restarted the vm? you should get more resolutions
2011-12-03T00:52:00.000Z	ThinkT510	shomon	check alsamixer in a terminal
2011-12-03T00:52:00.000Z	ThinkT510	shomon	none muted?
2011-12-03T00:53:00.000Z	ThinkT510	shomon	no worries :)
2012-11-08T18:29:00.000Z	ThinkT510	shomon	gnome2 is no longer supported
