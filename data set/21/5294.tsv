2008-03-28T10:26:00.000Z	RabidWeezle		whelp, it looks like it connections, but there is no screen, like the monitor of the target pc lights back up but nothing happens
2008-03-28T10:26:00.000Z	RabidWeezle		CConn:       connected to host 192.168.0.16 port 5900
2008-03-28T10:27:00.000Z	RabidWeezle		but no x window to play with :(
2008-03-28T10:27:00.000Z	RabidWeezle		vncviewer 192.168.0.16
2008-03-28T10:27:00.000Z	RabidWeezle		it doesn't even ask for a password
2008-03-28T10:28:00.000Z	RabidWeezle		and there is a password involved
2008-03-28T10:29:00.000Z	RabidWeezle		yep, the thing is, it's using a tightvnc server, it logs in on the web page style version just fine, but it wouldn't even connect to a realvnc server on a windows machine
2008-03-28T10:30:00.000Z	ere4si	RabidWeezle	shouldn't it be 192.168.0.16:1 ?
2008-03-28T10:30:00.000Z	RabidWeezle		nope, it's :0 for the main screen
2008-03-28T10:30:00.000Z	RabidWeezle		I'm logging into an xbox, and it's instructions are :0
2008-03-28T10:31:00.000Z	RabidWeezle		running gentoox
2008-03-28T10:31:00.000Z	RabidWeezle		I did it with no 0 davenull
2008-03-28T10:31:00.000Z	RabidWeezle		it's not asking for my password
2008-03-28T10:32:00.000Z	RabidWeezle		on 3 machines? and 2 os'es?
2008-03-28T10:32:00.000Z	RabidWeezle		and they can all see each other?
2008-03-28T10:32:00.000Z	RabidWeezle		and they all work, but this viewer don't...
2008-03-28T10:33:00.000Z	RabidWeezle	davenull	this machine is the one with the messed up viewer, hence why I'm asking about it
2008-03-28T10:34:00.000Z	RabidWeezle		I didn't ask about the server on the other end, I know it works
2008-03-28T10:34:00.000Z	RabidWeezle		I tested it on 2 other machines
2008-03-28T10:35:00.000Z	RabidWeezle		maybe there is a svn I can get a reliable new version of the viewer...
2008-03-28T10:35:00.000Z	ere4si	RabidWeezle	is the server listed in your /etc/hosts?
