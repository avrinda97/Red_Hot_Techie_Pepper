2007-08-16T10:26:00.000Z	h1st0	carretto	if they dont' make a linux version you need to use wine and install it.
2007-08-16T10:27:00.000Z	h1st0	carretto	sudo apt-get install wine
2007-08-16T10:27:00.000Z	h1st0	carretto	then you can just wine setup.exe or whatever. to install it.
2007-08-16T10:27:00.000Z	h1st0	carretto	or right click ont he exe and set wine to be the default for exe files

2007-08-16T10:29:00.000Z	h1st0	carretto	You need to get MFC42.DLL from  www.dll-files.com/  and put it in ~/.wine/drive_c/windows/system
2007-08-16T10:30:00.000Z	h1st0	carretto	you can check out appdb.wine-hq.org  search there for directions if they have any.
2007-08-16T10:30:00.000Z	h1st0	carretto	if it doesn't work though might not work with linux then.  Unless you runa  virtual box of windows and install there.  But that would be painfully slow.
