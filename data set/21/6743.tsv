2007-02-16T11:42:00.000Z	dabaR	cables	con-man: in theory, only one of you can have the last word.
2007-02-16T11:42:00.000Z	cables	dabaR	he's impatient and as a result feels ignored and is taking it out on me.
2007-02-16T12:35:00.000Z	cables	dabaR	shouldn't it be "sudo mount"?
2007-02-16T12:31:00.000Z	cables	dabaR	he sudo rm -rf /'d.
2007-02-16T12:32:00.000Z	cables	dabaR	i have it, hold on

2007-02-16T12:33:00.000Z	cables	dabaR	sorry, thought you were talking about something else
2007-02-16T12:34:00.000Z	cables	dabaR	he RM -RF /'d! how the hell will that help?
2007-02-16T12:34:00.000Z	cables	dabaR	gortba, sorry... I'm a bit annoyed. There may be an "undelete" sorta thing for Ext3, not sure though.
2007-02-16T12:35:00.000Z	dabaR	cables	it is best to ignore people that yiou find annoying. Only post in attempt to help the person you are speaking to is a good rule.
2007-02-16T12:35:00.000Z	dabaR	cables	it works either way.
2007-02-16T12:39:00.000Z	cables	dabaR	I'll stop talking to dilch now

2007-04-03T10:15:00.000Z	cables	dabaR	nope, sorry
2007-04-03T10:15:00.000Z	dabaR	cables	I am not asking because you should not be asking that here...there is a #sed, they may know.
