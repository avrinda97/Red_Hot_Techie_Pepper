2010-09-29T16:49:00.000Z	iceroot		how to see if a file is a link to another file or if it is a "real" file
2010-09-29T16:50:00.000Z	quack	iceroot	avoid hardlinks if you can.
2010-09-29T16:52:00.000Z	iceroot	quack	correct, that is a hardlink
2010-09-29T16:53:00.000Z	quack	iceroot	so you have to know in advance all references to an hardlink in order to free the space on disk.  Worse than checking if a symlink is dangling or not.
2010-09-29T16:54:00.000Z	iceroot	quack	i dont care about freeing the space, that is part of the kernel
2010-09-29T16:54:00.000Z	iceroot	quack	or the filesystem, i dont know
2010-09-29T16:56:00.000Z	iceroot	quack	if i am correct, unlink foobar is killing foobar and all hardlinks of it
2010-09-29T16:57:00.000Z	iceroot	quack	but i need hardlinks because i wrote a backup-script using rsync with hardlinks and deleting old backups automaticly
2010-09-29T16:57:00.000Z	iceroot	quack	so for every new backup i only have to copy new files, else rsync is setting a hardlink
2010-09-29T16:57:00.000Z	iceroot	quack	and have a look at "tab" to complete my nick correctly
2010-09-29T16:58:00.000Z	iceroot	quack	but that is fine that foobar will only get complety deleted if there is no foobar anymore
2010-09-29T16:59:00.000Z	quack	iceroot	does your program know ALL hardlinks?  (same disk volume, only on files)
2010-09-29T17:01:00.000Z	iceroot	quack	rsync knows all hardlinks
2010-09-29T17:02:00.000Z	quack	iceroot	if you are sure, use them.  No harm trying.  You can always resort to symlinks later.
2010-09-29T17:03:00.000Z	iceroot	quack	with symlinks i have a big problem
2010-09-29T17:03:00.000Z	iceroot	quack	i make a backup everyday, on the first day i create foobar, the day 2-6 i dont change foobar, on the 8 day i delete the backup from day 1. have fun with symlinks...
2010-09-29T17:04:00.000Z	iceroot	quack	for that, hardlinks are perfect
2010-09-29T17:06:00.000Z	quack	iceroot	I do not understand why the problem there.  Just create the foobar-YYYMMDD.bkp file, close it, symlink through EXTERNAL-PROGRAM, and open the symlink with WITH-OPEN-FILE.
2010-09-29T17:07:00.000Z	quack	iceroot	close the symlink when you rotate the backup by falling out of WITH-OPEN-FILE and open a new one with the procedure above.
2010-09-29T17:07:00.000Z	iceroot	quack	rsync has a build-in check-and-build-hardlink option
2010-09-29T17:08:00.000Z	iceroot	quack	so i dont need to fight with symlinks, also rsync is checking if the file is already there as a hardlink and not sending the same file again, so i dont have to fight with diffs too
