2005-12-24T10:42:00.000Z	varsendoogle		not sur if it was .03 just go to mozilla.firefox.blah and you should be able to find the extinsion called calender
2005-12-24T10:42:00.000Z	varsendoogle		there is calender and there is sunbird and sunkbird is just stand alone
2005-12-24T10:42:00.000Z	varsendoogle		jsut a sec
2005-12-24T10:43:00.000Z	varsendoogle	shadeofgrey	which do you want the stand alone or the extension?
2005-12-24T10:43:00.000Z	shadeofgrey	varsendoogle	id kinda like the standalone
2005-12-24T10:44:00.000Z	varsendoogle	shadeofgrey	ok
