2007-06-17T10:46:00.000Z	n2diy	Naisenu	and you missed 18 million hits like this one? http://www.dtp-aus.com/ext_set.htm
2007-06-17T10:47:00.000Z	Naisenu	n2diy	Except I'm not looking for the extended character set
2007-06-17T10:48:00.000Z	Naisenu	n2diy	I was looking for how to input these characters using the compose key. E.g. Compose-^-a
2007-06-17T10:49:00.000Z	n2diy	Naisenu	I thought you where looking for the inverted question mark, 161, and exclamation mark, 191?
2007-06-17T10:50:00.000Z	Naisenu	n2diy	I am looking for those. I am looking for how to input them with the above-mentioned method.
2007-06-17T10:51:00.000Z	n2diy	Naisenu	wait, I've don it before, just don't remember how.
2007-06-17T12:06:00.000Z	n2diy	Naisenu	are you still waiting?
2007-06-17T12:07:00.000Z	Naisenu	n2diy	not especially, but if you found info sure
2007-06-17T12:08:00.000Z	n2diy	Naisenu	ok, still working on it, alt+shift, XXX is producing stuff for me
2007-06-17T12:09:00.000Z	Naisenu	n2diy	you can leave me a PM if you find something
2007-06-17T12:09:00.000Z	n2diy	Naisenu	But not what I'm expecting, or it should be. But I'm using a Dvorak keyboard, so that could be a problem.
2007-06-17T12:10:00.000Z	Naisenu	n2diy	American using Dvorak or from afar where it's standard?
2007-06-17T12:10:00.000Z	n2diy	Naisenu	Roger on the PM, I'd rather share it here.
2007-06-17T12:11:00.000Z	n2diy	Naisenu	It was easier to learn Dvorak, than Qwerty.
2007-06-17T12:16:00.000Z	n2diy	Naisenu	I'm at a loss, ctrl-alt, +xxx is giving me extended characters, but not the right ones?
2007-06-17T12:19:00.000Z	n2diy	Naisenu	And the keyboard layout shouldn't matter, a character code is a character code, no?
2007-06-21T10:43:00.000Z	Naisenu	n2diy	Aw it's fun watching naive people talk to bots. :)
2007-06-21T10:44:00.000Z	n2diy	Naisenu	been there done that, you to I bet?
2007-06-21T10:44:00.000Z	Naisenu	n2diy	not for eons.
2007-06-21T10:44:00.000Z	n2diy	Naisenu	fool me once...
