2011-06-08T13:58:00.000Z	ikonia	Yami_Bas	what instructions are you using ?
2011-06-08T13:58:00.000Z	ikonia	Yami_Bas	ok - what part are you stuck on
2011-06-08T13:59:00.000Z	ikonia	Yami_Bas	I'd rather you just explained what you're stuck with
2011-06-08T13:59:00.000Z	ikonia	Yami_Bas	ok - what's the first step
2011-06-08T14:00:00.000Z	ikonia	Yami_Bas	ok, if you're not happy with that level of information, I suggest you ask your school admin to help you,
2011-06-08T14:00:00.000Z	ikonia	Yami_Bas	not being rude, but if that's too complex for you, you're possibly going to do damage to your machine
2011-06-08T14:01:00.000Z	ikonia	Yami_Bas	so it is best to ask your schools admin on how to do it
2011-06-08T14:01:00.000Z	ikonia	Yami_Bas	yes, you don't know how to do it, so asking your local admin for help is the best option
2011-06-08T14:01:00.000Z	ikonia	Yami_Bas	ask your admin, as they are instructions local/specific to your school
2011-06-08T14:02:00.000Z	ikonia	Yami_Bas	you should talk to your admins, the instructions are specifc to your school
2011-06-08T14:02:00.000Z	ikonia	Yami_Bas	ok - so talk to your admins
2011-06-08T14:02:00.000Z	ikonia	Yami_Bas	please don't use phrases like retard
2011-06-08T14:03:00.000Z	ikonia	Yami_Bas	then I can't be bothered to help you either
2011-06-08T14:05:00.000Z	Yami_Bas	ikonia	what is so offensive about it...?
