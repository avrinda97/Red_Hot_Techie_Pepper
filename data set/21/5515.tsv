2007-12-14T18:36:00.000Z	bazhang	Voyage_	no need to do so; not like norton or pc-cillin--just a front end for iptables

2007-12-14T18:43:00.000Z	Voyage_	bazhang	snort is command based. i have it. is there a gui for that?
2007-12-14T18:43:00.000Z	Voyage_	bazhang	and  i want to see the icon changed to red when intrusion occurs. and i can see the blocked ip port in "events"
2007-12-14T18:44:00.000Z	bazhang	Voyage_	no idea about a gui--never use it meself
2007-12-14T18:45:00.000Z	bazhang	Voyage_	if you want to see a ton of intrusions, then Linux is not the place
2007-12-14T20:19:00.000Z	Voyage_	bazhang	i missed the url you gave. and any msg you gave. i was disconnected.           how can i make sure the icon of firestarter remains in the sys tray. and doesnot disappears after some time?
2007-12-14T20:20:00.000Z	bazhang	Voyage_	that does nothing--this is not windows :}; the thing you need to do is set up a strict firewall (are you behind a router?) and then it is good to go
2007-12-14T20:22:00.000Z	Voyage_	bazhang	- the icon of firestarter turns red when an unauthorised access try is made and if it is visible in the tray always. i can observe that.      and any way. why does it disappears. how can i make sure it doest ?
2007-12-14T20:50:00.000Z	Voyage_	bazhang	i didnt found the way to make the sys tray icon be visible all the time in those links.
2007-12-14T20:51:00.000Z	bazhang	Voyage_	it's not necesary. post something on ubuntuforums if you wish :}
2007-12-14T20:52:00.000Z	Voyage_	bazhang	ok..
2007-12-14T20:52:00.000Z	Voyage_	bazhang	thx
2007-12-14T20:53:00.000Z	bazhang	Voyage_	no worries
2007-12-14T22:28:00.000Z	Voyage_	bazhang	- btw, how can i be sure that firestarter is running. (iam behind a router of isp) ?
2007-12-14T22:29:00.000Z	bazhang	Voyage_	set your iptables then go to a site testing your ports--check google for such a site
2007-12-14T22:29:00.000Z	Voyage_	bazhang	iam behind a router . that wont work
2007-12-14T22:30:00.000Z	bazhang	Voyage_	no idea then sorry
