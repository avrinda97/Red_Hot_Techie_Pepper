2012-07-11T18:48:00.000Z	summentier		@sivpvarma: did you try "sudo apt-get remove jupiter; sudo apt-get autoremove"?
2012-07-11T18:49:00.000Z	sivapvarma	summentier	yeah I alread tried that, think I did not add sudo apt-get autoremove in askubuntu question
2012-07-11T18:52:00.000Z	summentier	sivapvarma	hummmm...  did you take a look at the syslogs (/var/log/syslog)  and its "rotated" versions (.1 etc.)?
2012-07-11T18:54:00.000Z	sivapvarma	summentier	Ok I will try doing that now
2012-07-11T19:02:00.000Z	sivapvarma	summentier	before getting into logs, I want ask what does this mean
2012-07-11T19:04:00.000Z	sivapvarma	summentier	from tty1 when I try to reboot I am getting a message that says 'acpid: exiting',  will this happen normally
2012-07-11T19:05:00.000Z	summentier	sivapvarma	I think so, yes. ACPI is the interface to the power management of your computer, which handles events like pressing the power button on your computer etc.
2012-07-11T19:07:00.000Z	sivapvarma	summentier	any idea how to fix it
2012-07-11T19:10:00.000Z	summentier	sivapvarma	What is the problem? You are now unable to shut down or to boot?
2012-07-11T19:11:00.000Z	sivapvarma	summentier	as I explained in my askubuntu question I am now unable to boot into Unity, I am able to access only the tty terminals we get by Ctrl-Alt-F1 etc
2012-07-11T19:14:00.000Z	sivapvarma	summentier	doing it now,
2012-07-11T19:23:00.000Z	sivapvarma	summentier	there is something about BIOS-provided physical ram map
2012-07-11T19:25:00.000Z	sivapvarma	summentier	and then a bunch of hex numbers saying usable or reserved or etc
2012-07-11T19:26:00.000Z	summentier	sivapvarma	this thing can be quite huge, try to skip the first couple of pages and look for some error messages.
2012-07-11T19:27:00.000Z	sivapvarma	summentier	also there is one message that says Could not open output pipe '/dev/xconsole'
2012-07-11T19:28:00.000Z	summentier	sivapvarma	That's interesting. Try to google that message, I unfortunately never had the problem myself.
2012-07-11T19:29:00.000Z	sivapvarma	summentier	it also gave a link www.rsyslog.com/e/2039 beside that error message
