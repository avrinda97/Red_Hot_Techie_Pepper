2005-09-12T13:21:00.000Z	linner		has anyone successfully installed the Macromedia Flash Player into Mozilla?
2005-09-12T13:21:00.000Z	linner		man, am i have a hard time
2005-09-12T13:21:00.000Z	linner		oops having
2005-09-12T13:21:00.000Z	topyli	linner	yes, i've done apt-get install flashplayer-nonfree
2005-09-12T13:22:00.000Z	linner	topyli	 non free?
2005-09-12T13:23:00.000Z	linner	topyli	 hold on a sec... I'm going to try that command
2005-09-12T13:24:00.000Z	linner	topyli	 nope... that didn't work either
2005-09-12T13:25:00.000Z	topyli	linner	oh, it's flashplugin-nonfree
2005-09-12T13:26:00.000Z	linner	topyli	 ok
2005-09-12T13:26:00.000Z	topyli	linner	that's the original macromedia non-free plugin
2005-09-12T13:27:00.000Z	linner	topyli	 yeah it's still not working
2005-09-12T13:28:00.000Z	topyli	linner	it's in multiverse. do you have it enabled?
2005-09-12T13:28:00.000Z	linner	topyli	 I don't know what multiverse is... I'm 3 days new to linux....
2005-09-12T13:29:00.000Z	topyli	linner	see what ubotu tells you
2005-09-12T13:31:00.000Z	topyli	linner	what did you download? it's completely unnecessary
2005-09-12T13:31:00.000Z	linner	topyli	the macromedia flash plug in
2005-09-12T13:31:00.000Z	topyli	linner	just get your repositories set up and use apt
2005-09-12T13:38:00.000Z	topyli	linner	this is more simple than windows. you install anything with a single command instead of downloading, installing, and worrying about stuff
2005-09-12T13:39:00.000Z	linner	topyli	 I see what you mean
2005-09-12T13:40:00.000Z	linner	topyli	 I understand... :)  It's just that I am... like millions of other "trained robots" used to doing it a certain way....
