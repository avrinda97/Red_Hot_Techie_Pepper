2010-07-19T15:50:00.000Z	cage_raphel	erUSUL	 its done.. now what should i do ?
2010-07-19T15:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	cage_raphel	instead of removing it just reformat it and mount it somewhere ....
2010-07-19T15:47:00.000Z	cage_raphel	erUSUL	how do i do that ?
2010-07-19T15:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	cage_raphel	with gparted ?
2010-07-19T15:47:00.000Z	cage_raphel	erUSUL	i have opened my gparted now.. could u pls walk me thro.. i am a total linux newbie :)
2010-07-19T15:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	cage_raphel	well; gparted should be pretty self explanatory. right click on the partition (sda1) and choose format ext4
2010-07-19T15:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	cage_raphel	all data in the partition will be lost
2010-07-19T15:49:00.000Z	cage_raphel	erUSUL	 i have done that .. its applying pending operations :)
2010-07-19T15:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	cage_raphel	dunno; what do you want to use the partition for? i have data partitions mounted in /media/
2010-07-19T15:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	cage_raphel	for example for music/videos/etc
2010-07-19T15:51:00.000Z	cage_raphel	erUSUL	 i have formated sda1 to ext4.. now i want my ubuntu to use that partition
2010-07-19T15:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	cage_raphel	sudo mkdir /media/data ; sudo mount -t ext4 /dev/sda1 /media/data
2010-07-19T15:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	cage_raphel	this will make the space avable under /media/data/
2010-07-19T15:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	cage_raphel	to make it permanent we have to add a line for it to /etc/fstab
2010-10-09T19:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	cage_raphel	the caps lock  and the scroll lock lights on my keyboard starts flashing..
2010-10-09T19:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	cage_raphel	that's a kernel panic
2010-10-09T19:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	cage_raphel	the BSOD of linux
2010-10-09T19:44:00.000Z	cage_raphel	erUSUL	yeah.. i remember those words on my screen.. kernel panic.. what does that mean?
2010-10-09T19:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	cage_raphel	it is a serious issue. but weithout the actual error message that come with the panic we can not know.
2010-10-09T19:45:00.000Z	cage_raphel	erUSUL	will a fresh install of ubuntu help me resolve the issue?
2010-10-09T19:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	cage_raphel	i dunno; as i said hard to know with such little info.
