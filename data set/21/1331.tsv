2010-10-20T05:15:00.000Z	djanatan		It's only Master, PCM, Capture, Digital, and Mux
2010-10-20T05:16:00.000Z	djanatan		But only those things appeared in Fedora 13 where my audio worked fine
2010-10-20T05:16:00.000Z	djanatan		for both input and output
2010-10-20T05:17:00.000Z	djanatan		lol, thank you
2010-10-20T05:17:00.000Z	djanatan		finally
2010-10-20T05:18:00.000Z	djanatan		He's been causing problems in here for an hour
2010-10-20T05:20:00.000Z	h00k	djanatan	Benkinooby: Please move on and stay on the subject
2010-10-20T05:21:00.000Z	djanatan		Yeah, the soundcard works fine
2010-10-20T05:21:00.000Z	djanatan		My audio and all that works
2010-10-20T05:21:00.000Z	djanatan		I'm getting close to going out and buying a USB headset
2010-10-20T05:21:00.000Z	djanatan		But I don't want to spend money
2010-10-20T05:21:00.000Z	djanatan		Because my soundcard for some reason will not accept input from my mic
2010-10-20T05:22:00.000Z	djanatan		No, on the front of the laptop there is set of audio plugs
2010-10-20T05:22:00.000Z	djanatan		My current headset has an input jack and an output jack
2010-10-20T05:23:00.000Z	djanatan		It worked last time I used it, which was with Fedora 13 on 32-bit
2010-10-20T05:23:00.000Z	djanatan		Now I'm on Linux Mint 9 on 64-bit
2010-10-20T05:23:00.000Z	djanatan		I've already gotten everything I could from linuxmint-help
2010-10-20T05:24:00.000Z	djanatan		They weren't helpful.
2010-10-20T05:24:00.000Z	djanatan		I'm not exactly asking for corporate support.
2010-10-20T05:24:00.000Z	h00k	djanatan	this still isn't the place for mint support, and it's not based off Ubuntu anymore, they're a debian derivative.
2010-10-20T05:24:00.000Z	djanatan	h00k	Mint 9 is based on Ubuntu 10.04, and the upcoming Mint 10 is based on Ubuntu 10.10.
