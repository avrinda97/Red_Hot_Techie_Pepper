2005-10-08T05:22:00.000Z	Trashcan		I assume debian packages are similar enough to Ubuntu packages?
2005-10-08T05:23:00.000Z	ccooke	Trashcan	Same system. Ubuntu is based on debian.
2005-10-08T05:23:00.000Z	Trashcan		right, ccooke
2005-10-08T05:24:00.000Z	ccooke	Trashcan	however, in many cases you can't use Debian packages on Ubuntu
2005-10-08T05:24:00.000Z	Trashcan		I see..
2005-10-08T05:25:00.000Z	ccooke	Trashcan	basically, there are enough small differences - location of some files in the distro, some different choices about what's running etc - to make the larger or more complex packages break if you install them
2005-10-08T05:25:00.000Z	ccooke	Trashcan	okay?
2005-10-08T05:25:00.000Z	Trashcan		gotcha, ccooke
2005-10-08T05:26:00.000Z	ccooke	Trashcan	There's little need to use packages directly from Debian on Ubuntu, though
2005-10-08T05:26:00.000Z	Trashcan	ccooke	the question was about creating packages for use with ubuntu, in which case, it's the same format and should work properly?
2005-10-08T05:26:00.000Z	Trashcan		alright
2005-10-08T05:26:00.000Z	Trashcan		thanks
2005-10-08T05:27:00.000Z	ccooke	Trashcan	if you enable the universe and multiverse repositories in synaptic, you get access to all the packages in Debian (about 17,000) rebuilt for Ubuntu - so they'll all work.
2005-10-08T05:27:00.000Z	ccooke	Trashcan	ah, yes. You should have no trouble there.
2005-10-08T05:27:00.000Z	Trashcan		hehe- nice
2005-10-08T05:27:00.000Z	ccooke	Trashcan	debs are very easy to work with.
