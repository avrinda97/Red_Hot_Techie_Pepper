2008-02-01T09:39:00.000Z	zachalink		well I would like to connect to a leopard imac using ubuntu 7.10
2008-02-01T09:40:00.000Z	zachalink		and samba
2008-02-01T09:40:00.000Z	zachalink		the problem is, the mac can connect to me, but not vice versa
2008-02-01T09:40:00.000Z	norv	zachalink	okay, so your server is set up properly, that's good
2008-02-01T09:41:00.000Z	norv	zachalink	is the mac running a samba server?
2008-02-01T09:43:00.000Z	norv	zachalink	might want to ask on #macosx, I don't really know how
2008-02-01T09:48:00.000Z	zachalink	norv	yes, it's running on a samba server
2008-02-01T09:48:00.000Z	norv	zachalink	any particular error message when you try to connect?
2008-02-01T09:51:00.000Z	zachalink	norv	I have a problem with the mac network showing up in "Network", no error messages though.
2008-02-01T09:51:00.000Z	zachalink	norv	 Is there a way to manually connect to the mac network?
2008-02-01T09:52:00.000Z	norv	zachalink	you can try connecting with smbclient, if you know the mac's ip address
2008-02-01T09:53:00.000Z	zachalink	norv	And how exactly would I do that?
2008-02-01T09:55:00.000Z	zachalink	norv	can you tell me how to use that smbclient?
2008-02-01T09:55:00.000Z	norv	zachalink	looking up the man page as I no longer ever touch samba
2008-02-01T09:57:00.000Z	norv	zachalink	okay, smbclient //SERVER/share
2008-02-01T09:58:00.000Z	norv	zachalink	where SERVER is the mac's NETBios name and share is the shared dir
2008-02-01T09:59:00.000Z	norv	zachalink	btw, can you access any other systems via samba through your Ubuntu box?
2008-02-01T09:59:00.000Z	zachalink	norv	but do I type that in terminal?
2008-02-01T09:59:00.000Z	norv	zachalink	yes
2008-02-01T10:00:00.000Z	norv	zachalink	and the linux server can be thought of as another system... if THAT doesn't appear locally something's really up
2008-02-01T10:02:00.000Z	norv	zachalink	it could be the ip address, and I think that IP address will invariably work. Whatever is the case, if the systems aren't on the same subnet... well that's ruled out
