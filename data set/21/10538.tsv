2005-05-22T10:27:00.000Z	veritas	tritium	Where ya' at now, and what are studying in grad school?
2005-05-22T10:38:00.000Z	tritium	veritas	sorry, didn't see your question above.  Did you get the answer?
2005-05-23T13:11:00.000Z	tritium	veritas	that's not code.  That is your sudoers file
2005-05-23T13:11:00.000Z	tritium	veritas	you should be able to edit /etc/sudoers with "sudo visudo"
2005-05-23T13:12:00.000Z	veritas	tritium	I accidently linked to the wrong file :x
2005-05-23T13:12:00.000Z	tritium	veritas	;)
