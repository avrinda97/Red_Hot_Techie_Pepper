2007-08-19T11:29:00.000Z	brophat		Intel Core2 Duo processors would use the "64bit AMD and Intel computers" version of ubuntu?
2007-08-19T11:29:00.000Z	dystopianray	brophat	use 32-bit ubuntu
2007-08-19T11:30:00.000Z	dystopianray	brophat	it's not unstable, but the 32-bit ubuntu is recommended
2007-09-20T10:21:00.000Z	dystopianray	brophat	probably ext3
2007-09-20T10:22:00.000Z	brophat	dystopianray	isn't that an old and outdated one?
2007-09-20T10:22:00.000Z	dystopianray	brophat	no
2007-09-20T10:22:00.000Z	dystopianray	brophat	it is an excellent filesystem and the perfect default choice unless you have a very good reason to use something else
2007-09-20T10:23:00.000Z	brophat	dystopianray	i thought a journal fs was better, no?
2007-09-20T10:23:00.000Z	dystopianray	brophat	ext3 is journalled
2007-09-20T10:46:00.000Z	dystopianray	brophat	alsamixer
2007-09-20T13:20:00.000Z	dystopianray	brophat	probably becuase your sound card doesn't have them
2007-09-20T13:22:00.000Z	brophat	dystopianray	but all the solutions I have been told on how to solve my headphone jack problems requires it.
2007-09-20T13:22:00.000Z	dystopianray	brophat	they are probably for different sound cards
2007-09-20T13:22:00.000Z	brophat	dystopianray	do you know how I can fix my problem?
2007-09-20T13:22:00.000Z	dystopianray	brophat	no sorry
2007-12-22T09:04:00.000Z	dystopianray	brophat	low signal strength
2007-12-22T09:05:00.000Z	brophat	dystopianray	but when it connects it stays connected
2007-12-22T09:05:00.000Z	dystopianray	brophat	does it operate slowly when connected?
2007-12-22T09:05:00.000Z	brophat	dystopianray	not that I can tell; I am very happy with it
2007-12-22T09:07:00.000Z	brophat	dystopianray	always on boot of my puter the wireless nic always times out, and then I have to manually start it about twice, and it finally connects and stays connected; weird no?
2007-12-22T09:10:00.000Z	dystopianray	brophat	yes, i guess that is pretty weird
