2011-09-14T07:36:00.000Z	wildgoose		!xrandr > eblume
2011-09-14T07:37:00.000Z	eblume		Thanks wildgoose! Sure hope you aren't sending me on an eponimous chase. ;)
2011-09-14T07:38:00.000Z	wildgoose	eblume	Heheh we'll see.
2011-09-14T07:42:00.000Z	eblume	wildgoose	In this post ( http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/intel-gfx/2009-October/004616.html ) someone with my exact TV seems to have it working. Can you parse what he said to tell me what the heck he did to make it work? Pretty please?
2011-09-14T07:45:00.000Z	eblume		OK so basically I'm back to my original question. In 11.04, where should I go to modify the existing Section 'Monitor'?
2011-09-14T07:49:00.000Z	eblume		Can  anyone tell me where in Ubuntu 11.04 I can edit the "Section 'Monitor'" values of the currently loaded monitors?
2011-09-14T07:50:00.000Z	wildgoose	eblume	Those lists are a mess, can you pastebin the output of xrandr -q
2011-09-14T07:51:00.000Z	eblume	wildgoose	http://pastebin.com/migBnDt7
2011-09-14T07:51:00.000Z	eblume	wildgoose	I am 90% certain that the TV is connected to HDMI2, not HDMI1
2011-09-14T07:54:00.000Z	eblume	wildgoose	in this post ( http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/intel-gfx/2009-October/004562.html ) the guy with my TV seems to post his configs and some xrandr lines that might be what make it work? But I tried running the first xrandr --newmode command it it errored out about 'bad color' something or other.
2011-09-14T07:59:00.000Z	wildgoose	eblume	Try this instead http://pastebin.com/y2uATNiV
2011-09-14T08:01:00.000Z	eblume	wildgoose	I assume you meant HDMI2 and not HDMI1, and also is it OK if I name the mode something else? that mode name appears to be taken. Assuming both of those are OK - I tried and it didn't have any noticeable effect.
2011-09-14T08:01:00.000Z	eblume	wildgoose	no errors though, just no flicker on the TV
2011-09-14T08:02:00.000Z	wildgoose	eblume	Hmm, so no errors and a new mode added?
2011-09-14T08:03:00.000Z	eblume	wildgoose	Yup. I also tried the mode listed on that thread I linked with a new name this time, and also no flicker on the screen.
2011-09-14T08:03:00.000Z	eblume	wildgoose	I'm assuming I just need to run those three commands and the screen should, in theory, start showing a desktop?
2011-09-14T08:04:00.000Z	eblume	wildgoose	many thanks for the help by the way
2011-09-14T08:06:00.000Z	eblume	wildgoose	It seems I keep hearing about using the -intel or -ati modes or drivers, but I haven't a clue how to set this. All I can say about drivers is that this box is using an embedded intel chipset, and it worked for my desktop monitor (HDMI1) out of the box.
2011-09-14T08:08:00.000Z	wildgoose	eblume	That may be the case, I'm afraid I'm out ideas for the moment.
2011-09-14T08:08:00.000Z	eblume	wildgoose	Well, thank you anyway.
