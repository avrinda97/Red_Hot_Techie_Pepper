2009-07-11T05:05:00.000Z	guedesav		anyone knows anything about the "Setting '802-1x' is empty, discarding" problem?
2009-07-11T05:07:00.000Z	guedesav		I can still connect to the router wirelessly via Windows or even a DS, but the Ubuntu will only connect wired(like I'm doing now :( ), and knetworkmanager gives me this strange "Setting '802-1x' is empty, discarding" message. Anyone know why?
2009-07-11T05:07:00.000Z	guedesav		or, even better, how to solve this?
2009-07-11T05:07:00.000Z	coleys	guedesav	WPA or WEP?
2009-07-11T05:08:00.000Z	coleys	guedesav	No WPA doesn't work, uhm... Are you hex key or... string?
2009-07-11T05:09:00.000Z	guedesav	coleys	does it even make any difference?
2009-07-11T05:09:00.000Z	guedesav	coleys	I mean, in this case?
2009-07-11T05:09:00.000Z	coleys	guedesav	Don't answer then =p
2009-07-11T05:09:00.000Z	guedesav	coleys	sorry, I'm just asking, because if it does it might be the problem
2009-07-11T05:10:00.000Z	guedesav	coleys	and I already answered Hex
2009-07-11T05:10:00.000Z	guedesav	coleys	40-bit hex key
2009-07-11T05:10:00.000Z	coleys	guedesav	Have you chosen the key as WEP hex?
2009-07-11T05:11:00.000Z	guedesav	coleys	yes, WEP 40/128-bit Hexadecimal, as knetworkmanager says
2009-07-11T05:11:00.000Z	coleys	guedesav	There is two options? (maybe more) one is Wep Hex -- choose that one.
2009-07-11T05:11:00.000Z	guedesav	coleys	strangest thing is: yesterday night it was fine, and then today by morning it stopped connecting
2009-07-11T05:11:00.000Z	coleys	guedesav	Update recently?
2009-07-11T05:12:00.000Z	guedesav	coleys	no
2009-07-11T05:12:00.000Z	guedesav	coleys	I did install hibernate, but that was before
2009-07-11T05:12:00.000Z	guedesav	coleys	and then I installed octave
2009-07-11T05:12:00.000Z	guedesav	coleys	but I'm not sure if before or after my first hibernation test
2009-07-11T05:17:00.000Z	guedesav	coleys	any clue?
