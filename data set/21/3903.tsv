2009-01-11T16:43:00.000Z	Tapout		anyone else experiencing like 3-4 lockups a month?  gui doesn't respond... can ssh  in and stuff
2009-01-11T16:43:00.000Z	SiDi	Tapout	i had a GUI lockup once in the last year, Gnome (it was gnome, xfce was still alright), but that's all and likely because of me modifying the gconf manually
2009-01-11T16:46:00.000Z	Tapout	SiDi	it only seems to lockup when there are 'updates'... up top the red down arrow with the ! ...
2009-01-11T16:47:00.000Z	SiDi	Tapout	you may have errors in your logs, but as there are many logs it may take time to find them. DO you have the lockups when the update icon pops or just after it's done ?
2009-01-11T16:50:00.000Z	SiDi	Tapout	i'm gonna try to find this out but i really have no clue :/
2009-01-11T16:50:00.000Z	Tapout	SiDi	i'm searching the logs
2009-01-11T16:52:00.000Z	SiDi	Tapout	check "cat .xsessionerrors | grep EE" and tell me if there is something (you could " grep -i apt" too to see if there are problems with apt-get, the package manager)
2009-01-11T16:53:00.000Z	SiDi	Tapout	i don't think it's related to GDM if you have it when already on the system
2009-01-11T16:53:00.000Z	SiDi	Tapout	gdm is the login screen at startup
2009-01-11T16:54:00.000Z	SiDi	Tapout	is it similar to this : http://ubuntuforu1ms.org/showthread.php?t=454893 ?
2009-01-11T16:55:00.000Z	SiDi	Tapout	no idea, sorry ;p
2009-01-11T16:56:00.000Z	SiDi	Tapout	if you could keep it up till there's an update you could see if there's an error linked to that :P
2009-01-11T16:58:00.000Z	SiDi	Tapout	this link seems interesting too : speaks about apt and host resolving https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/sudo/+bug/231565
2009-01-11T17:01:00.000Z	SiDi	Tapout	gotta fix it now :P
2009-01-11T17:03:00.000Z	SiDi	Tapout	it seems it's a common mandriva bug :P
2009-01-11T17:04:00.000Z	SiDi	Tapout	on their french wiki they say you shall change boot options to avoid those freezes (and btw when it crashes, go to Ctrl+Alt+F1 and login, and type "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart" to avoid full reboot)
2009-01-11T17:05:00.000Z	SiDi	Tapout	it's in french though. YOu need to replace the default boot options by "linux-nonfb" in grub's boot menu, if i understood well. As this iis a mandriva wiki i can't tell you exactly how to do for ubuntu ;P
2009-01-11T17:06:00.000Z	SiDi	Tapout	http://forums.fedoraforum.org/showthread.php?p=1021712 here is the same bug on fedora, with another boot option suggested
2009-01-11T17:08:00.000Z	SiDi	Tapout	it doesn't seem to be very documented though. it'd be nice from you if you could post on ubuntuforums.com if you find the solution
2009-01-11T17:10:00.000Z	SiDi	Tapout	no idea honnestly
2009-01-11T17:17:00.000Z	SiDi	Tapout	don't hesitate pm-ing me if you want, i'm going away eating, i won't answer in #ubuntu
