2007-12-06T19:35:00.000Z	verb3k		Is there a difference (even if minimal) between installing a command-line system with the alternate CD and installing it from the server CD ?
2007-12-06T19:36:00.000Z	jrib	verb3k	pretty sure the server gives you a different kernel at least (yes)
2007-12-06T19:36:00.000Z	verb3k	jrib	I want to install it and then install fluxbox on it ....can I do that?
2007-12-06T19:37:00.000Z	jrib	verb3k	yes
2007-12-06T19:38:00.000Z	verb3k	jrib	which is more minimal (regardless of the kernel issue) alternate CD text-mode or Server install ?
2007-12-06T19:40:00.000Z	jrib	verb3k	if you want minimal, use the minimal cd.  If you want a server use the server install.  If you want a text-based system that will not be primarily a server, use the alt-cd
2007-12-06T19:40:00.000Z	verb3k	jrib	thank you very much jrib :)
2009-08-08T01:20:00.000Z	jrib	verb3k	try #mplayer
2009-08-08T01:20:00.000Z	verb3k	jrib	tried :( no use
2009-08-08T01:20:00.000Z	jrib	verb3k	how do you change brightness?  I'll test here
2009-08-08T01:21:00.000Z	verb3k	jrib	using the number 3 button
2009-08-08T01:24:00.000Z	jrib	verb3k	not saved here but I am on arch
2009-08-08T01:24:00.000Z	verb3k	jrib	hmm, I see
2009-08-08T01:24:00.000Z	verb3k	jrib	I am using mplayer from the repos
2009-08-08T01:24:00.000Z	verb3k	jrib	maybe I will cimpile?
2009-08-08T01:24:00.000Z	verb3k	jrib	compile*
2009-08-08T01:25:00.000Z	jrib	verb3k	check if debian added any patches
2009-08-08T01:25:00.000Z	jrib	verb3k	you're on jaunty?
2009-08-08T01:25:00.000Z	verb3k	jrib	yes on jaunty, do you think it's a bug, or just normal behavior
2009-08-08T01:26:00.000Z	jrib	verb3k	it would be a pretty weird bug for it to save the information somewhere.  Maybe you can run strace and see if it writes anywhere?
2009-08-08T01:26:00.000Z	verb3k	jrib	ok I will try, thanks for your help jrib  :) very much appreciated
