2007-01-07T12:07:00.000Z	fab_		nowhereman, I should be included yes
2007-01-07T12:09:00.000Z	NoWhereMan	fab_	I didnt understand u
2007-01-07T12:10:00.000Z	fab_	NoWhereMan	when you rightclick on a usb device, then there should be the eject-option (also in edgy)
2007-01-07T12:10:00.000Z	NoWhereMan	fab_	there used to be
2007-01-07T12:10:00.000Z	NoWhereMan		it's not anymore :/
2007-01-07T12:11:00.000Z	NoWhereMan		it worked using the disk applet, but it used to be there :/
2007-01-07T12:11:00.000Z	fab_		 NoWhereMan, you've done anything special before it disappeared?
2007-01-07T12:11:00.000Z	NoWhereMan	fab_	I think there was a dbus upadte today
2007-01-07T12:11:00.000Z	fab_	NoWhereMan	ok, hang on a moment
2007-01-07T12:14:00.000Z	fab_	NoWhereMan	I researched a bit, but I don't know how to recover it
2007-01-07T12:14:00.000Z	fab_	NoWhereMan	seems like you have to use the unmount command for a while
2007-01-07T12:15:00.000Z	NoWhereMan	fab_	disk applet works
2007-01-07T12:15:00.000Z	fab_	NoWhereMan	aha ok
2007-01-07T12:15:00.000Z	NoWhereMan		still that's really strange
2007-01-07T12:15:00.000Z	NoWhereMan	fab_	it's strange because there's no eect in computer:/// either :/
2007-01-07T12:16:00.000Z	fab_	NoWhereMan	that's really strange, but I'm too new to linux, I can't help you though :-/
2007-01-07T12:16:00.000Z	NoWhereMan	fab_	oh well thanks, then
