2009-10-18T00:05:00.000Z	bazhang	kp	there are partner repositories (seen via system administration software sources) as well as personal package archives (PPA's install at your own risk) for more esoteric packages that may be hard to find
2009-10-18T00:08:00.000Z	kp	bazhang	Yes I can see other partner repositories. Could you please let me know if there are any further suggestions.
2009-10-18T00:09:00.000Z	bazhang	kp	well there are repositories for wine, and the PPA I spoke of (though all of those are at your own risk)
2009-10-18T00:11:00.000Z	kp	bazhang	Yes I understand bit don't want to go on own risk. I looking for Adobe Dreamweaver for Ubuntu and trying all the all the possible way to install on Ubuntu but failed. Could you please let me know any other method of getting the dreamweaver
2009-10-18T00:15:00.000Z	bazhang	kp	aptana studio may be what you are looking
2009-10-18T00:16:00.000Z	kp	bazhang	I am not much aware of aptana studio. But dreamweaver is webpage designing software(I hope you know it).
