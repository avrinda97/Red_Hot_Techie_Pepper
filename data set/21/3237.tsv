2009-02-24T22:34:00.000Z	mistrynitesh		hello all, i need help setting up mail account in evolution
2009-02-24T22:35:00.000Z	mhall119	mistrynitesh	having trouble, or just don't know how?
2009-02-24T22:35:00.000Z	mistrynitesh	mhall119	having trouble.... i added the account
2009-02-24T22:35:00.000Z	mhall119	mistrynitesh	what trouble?
2009-02-24T22:37:00.000Z	mhall119	mistrynitesh	who is your mail host?
2009-02-24T22:38:00.000Z	mhall119	mistrynitesh	do they require authentication or something like that which you didn't configure in Evolution?
2009-02-24T22:39:00.000Z	mhall119	mistrynitesh	it should ask the first time it tries to connect, so maybe it can't find the mailhost?
2009-02-24T22:41:00.000Z	mhall119	mistrynitesh	using the right port?
2009-02-24T22:43:00.000Z	mhall119	mistrynitesh	use host:port format in the Server field
2009-02-24T22:56:00.000Z	mhall119	mistrynitesh	make sure you can find and connect to the hostname from your computer
2009-02-24T22:57:00.000Z	mhall119	mistrynitesh	that, or telnet if it's not an encrypted connection
2009-02-24T23:01:00.000Z	mhall119	mistrynitesh	sorry, should be "telnet $host $port", a space instead of colon
2009-02-24T23:03:00.000Z	mhall119	mistrynitesh	okay then....
2009-02-24T23:04:00.000Z	mhall119	mistrynitesh	you won't get a prompt
2009-02-24T23:05:00.000Z	mhall119	mistrynitesh	did you select Server Type: Pop3 in Evolution?
2009-02-24T23:07:00.000Z	mhall119	mistrynitesh	what was the output after you typed them?
2009-02-24T23:08:00.000Z	mhall119	mistrynitesh	what did you select for encryption and authentication options in evolution?
2009-02-24T23:10:00.000Z	mhall119	mistrynitesh	have you tried it without SSL?
2009-02-24T23:11:00.000Z	mhall119	mistrynitesh	same error?
2009-02-24T23:12:00.000Z	mhall119	mistrynitesh	it's never asking you to enter a password when you run send/recieve?
2009-02-24T23:18:00.000Z	mhall119	mistrynitesh	woo hoo! what made it work?
