2006-11-05T07:22:00.000Z	Flosoft		hey
2006-11-05T07:23:00.000Z	Flosoft		I got a question... I tried to install Ubuntu now several times
2006-11-05T07:23:00.000Z	Flosoft		apt-get from debian
2006-11-05T07:23:00.000Z	Flosoft		and all seems to work well, until one reboot and SSHd is down
2006-11-05T07:23:00.000Z	Flosoft		no SSH Server
2006-11-05T07:23:00.000Z	Flosoft		is there a way to access the machine ?
2006-11-05T07:23:00.000Z	Flosoft		I am not local
2006-11-05T07:23:00.000Z	mc_	Flosoft	/etc/init.d/ssh start
2006-11-05T07:24:00.000Z	mc_	Flosoft	does /etc/init.d/ssh start work?
2006-11-05T07:25:00.000Z	mc_	Flosoft	just try to start sshd,telnet is evil
2006-11-05T07:25:00.000Z	mc_	Flosoft	maybe trya reinstalling the package
2006-11-05T07:25:00.000Z	Flosoft	mc_	How do you want me to start SSHd if I can not access the server
2006-11-05T07:26:00.000Z	mc_	Flosoft	oh sorry,i did not understand you
2006-11-05T07:26:00.000Z	mc_	Flosoft	hm that sucks,do you have some kind of wed-administration tool linstalled?
2006-11-05T07:27:00.000Z	mc_	Flosoft	webmin has many security leaks
2006-11-05T07:27:00.000Z	Flosoft	mc_	I don't really care at this point
2006-11-05T07:28:00.000Z	mc_	Flosoft	you could run 2ssh's
2006-11-05T07:28:00.000Z	mc_	Flosoft	or you could write a very small script that restarts sshd in case of a crash
2006-11-05T07:28:00.000Z	mc_	Flosoft	on 2 different ports
2006-11-05T07:29:00.000Z	mc_	Flosoft	it was sshd,im quite sure
2006-11-05T07:29:00.000Z	mc_	Flosoft	well its your server
