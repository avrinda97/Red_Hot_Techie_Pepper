2006-07-20T16:14:00.000Z	epimer		easier question: what command do i type in the grub command line to list the available hard drives?
2006-07-20T16:15:00.000Z	soundray	epimer	you could do a 'find vmlinuz-2.6.15'; that will tell you where bootable kernels of that version are
2006-07-20T16:16:00.000Z	soundray	epimer	'geometry' might help, too, as might 'help'
2006-07-20T16:19:00.000Z	soundray	epimer	you also need to give it an initrd
2006-07-20T16:20:00.000Z	epimer	soundray	i don't know what that means
2006-07-20T16:21:00.000Z	soundray	epimer	do a 'find initrd' and feed one of the resulting files to grub with 'initrd /initrd-2.6.15-whatever' before you type 'boot'
2006-07-20T16:21:00.000Z	soundray	epimer	and after you've entered the 'kernel ...' line
2006-07-20T16:22:00.000Z	epimer	soundray	"find initrd" returned error 15: file not found :/
2006-07-20T16:22:00.000Z	soundray	epimer	'find /initrd'?
2006-07-20T16:23:00.000Z	epimer	soundray	file not found still
2006-07-20T16:23:00.000Z	soundray	epimer	'find /boot/initrd'?
2006-07-20T16:24:00.000Z	epimer	soundray	, same again
2006-07-20T16:24:00.000Z	soundray	epimer	strange -- is this an ubuntu installation?
2006-07-20T16:27:00.000Z	soundray	epimer	it sounds like you may have accidentally deleted vital part of the root system...
2006-07-20T16:29:00.000Z	soundray	epimer	well, first of all, you shouldn't edit /boot/grub/menu.lst~ -- that's a backup copy.
2006-07-20T16:29:00.000Z	soundray	epimer	then, the part of the file that says "AUTOMAGIC KERNELS LIST" is not supposed to be edited.
2006-07-20T16:30:00.000Z	soundray	epimer	to remove those options, you should remove the unused kernel packages
2006-07-20T16:31:00.000Z	soundray	epimer	you could try the fix from the wiki that you do when a Windows installation ruins grub. Watch ubotu:
2006-07-20T16:32:00.000Z	soundray	epimer	no promises, though...
2006-07-20T16:32:00.000Z	soundray	epimer	or rescue attempts with the Desktop CD
2006-07-20T16:32:00.000Z	soundray	epimer	you're welcome
