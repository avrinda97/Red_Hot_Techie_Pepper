2008-04-02T04:24:00.000Z	unop_	roffe__	you can't have a directory and file by the same name in the same directory
2008-04-02T04:26:00.000Z	unop_	roffe__	maybe you need to do this .. chmod +x ~/armyops/armyops; ~/armyops/armyops
2008-04-02T04:27:00.000Z	unop_	roffe__	maybe you need to do this .. chmod +x ~/armyops/armyops; ~/armyops/armyops
2008-04-02T04:28:00.000Z	unop_	roffe__	what is the full pathname of that file?
2008-04-02T04:29:00.000Z	unop_	roffe__	what happens when you type just this then?  /home/roffe/armyops/armyops
2008-04-02T04:30:00.000Z	unop_	roffe__	try this command first.. sudo aptitude install build-essential
2008-04-02T04:32:00.000Z	unop_	roffe__	ok, you should have gotten rid of this error once that is done
2008-04-02T04:35:00.000Z	unop_	roffe__	your executable needed a shared library that was missing
2008-04-02T04:37:00.000Z	unop_	roffe__	if everything is working now, you should be ok.
2008-04-02T04:47:00.000Z	unop_	roffe__	you might want to install links ..
2008-04-02T04:49:00.000Z	unop_	roffe__	its a cli web browser
2008-04-02T04:50:00.000Z	unop_	roffe__	for whatever it is that the thing is trying to install
2008-04-02T04:50:00.000Z	unop_	roffe__	it might be trying to download a file from a server and needs links inorder to do so
2008-04-02T04:50:00.000Z	unop_	roffe__	maybe .. sudo aptitude install links
2008-04-02T04:58:00.000Z	unop_	roffe__	all you need to do is make sense of the error messages you get
2008-04-02T05:01:00.000Z	unop_	roffe__	"/usr/bin/xterm: Can't execvp links: No such file or directory" < tells you that xterm has spit out a message saying it can't execute something called 'links' ..
