2009-06-24T08:38:00.000Z	Titan8990	Stanley_	one of these days I might go back to console gaming so I can do away with windows
2009-06-24T08:35:00.000Z	Titan8990	Stanley_	not saying linux is not my primary OS, but gaming in linux doesn't cut it for me whatsoever
2009-06-24T08:37:00.000Z	Stanley_	Titan8990	Yea i know, thats why us gamers have to dual boot. I play lots of games so I keep windows around
2009-06-24T08:38:00.000Z	Titan8990	Stanley_	but I doubt it... valve addict here
2009-06-24T08:38:00.000Z	Stanley_	Titan8990	Yup same... Left4Dead is my current addiction
2009-06-24T08:39:00.000Z	Titan8990	Stanley_	I went through the l4d faze but then right back to tf2
2009-07-22T03:22:00.000Z	Stanley_	Titan8990	sudo: mkfs.ntfs : command not found
2009-07-22T03:17:00.000Z	Titan8990	Stanley_	can't edit a mounted partition
2009-07-22T03:20:00.000Z	Titan8990	Stanley_	mkfs.ntfs /dev/DRIVE
2009-07-22T03:20:00.000Z	Titan8990	Stanley_	sorry, with sudo
2009-07-22T03:21:00.000Z	Titan8990	Stanley_	but like I said, it can't be mounted already
2009-07-22T03:21:00.000Z	Titan8990	Stanley_	yes, if /dev/sda6 is the partition
2009-07-22T03:23:00.000Z	Titan8990	Stanley_	do any of the mkfs commands exist?
2009-07-22T03:24:00.000Z	Titan8990	Stanley_	sudo aptitude install ntfsprogs
2009-07-22T03:25:00.000Z	Stanley_	Titan8990	how do i check? just installing the ntfsprogs now
2009-07-22T03:25:00.000Z	Titan8990	Stanley_	type mkfs and hit tab a couple times
2009-07-22T03:26:00.000Z	Stanley_	Titan8990	does the partition need to be created as EXT3 or something first?
2009-07-22T03:27:00.000Z	Titan8990	Stanley_	no
2009-07-22T03:27:00.000Z	Stanley_	Titan8990	it's unallocated space right now though, so it has to be _something_ to get a /dev/sda#
2009-07-22T03:27:00.000Z	Titan8990	Stanley_	it needs be a partition... i.e. you can't format an entire drive
2009-07-22T03:27:00.000Z	Titan8990	Stanley_	yeah, it needs to partitioned before formatted
