2010-12-18T04:38:00.000Z	cha0s2358		anyone familiar with hdd partitioning and dual booting?  i recentlly redid my system and im haing a few problems as well as a few questions.
2010-12-18T04:39:00.000Z	cha0s2358		first off it shows 6 different ubuntu 10.04 lts options when choosing operating system. ubuntu 10.10 lts 2-35-23,   2-35-24 ,     2-35-26  and then a recovery console for each of those. is that normal?
2010-12-18T04:41:00.000Z	cha0s2358		^^^^ this is when i turn my computer on and am supposed to choose between ubuntu and windws
2010-12-18T04:41:00.000Z	histo	cha0s2358	it's shwoing all the kernels
2010-12-18T04:41:00.000Z	histo	cha0s2358	you can remove the older kernels if you no longer want them.
2010-12-18T04:41:00.000Z	cha0s2358	histo	ok so that is normal ??
2010-12-18T04:42:00.000Z	histo	cha0s2358	yes
2010-12-18T04:42:00.000Z	cha0s2358	histo	ok so does it matter which one i choose?
2010-12-18T04:43:00.000Z	histo	cha0s2358	yes, you choose what kernel you want to boot. You can boot the latest one you have installed would be the highest number ex: 2.6.35-xxx vs 2.6.32-xxx 32 would be the older 0one.
2010-12-18T04:44:00.000Z	histo	cha0s2358	I usually only keep the current kernel and one prior on my machine incase I find an issue withthe current one.
2010-12-18T04:44:00.000Z	cha0s2358	histo	ok i get that but will they just keep pileing up? how do i remove the older ones?
2010-12-18T04:44:00.000Z	histo	cha0s2358	with software center or synaptic
2010-12-18T04:45:00.000Z	histo	cha0s2358	they will be names like linux-image-2.6.3xxxxxxx
2010-12-18T04:46:00.000Z	cha0s2358	histo	ok last question is it possible and how exactlly would i go about taking my 320 gig hdd and seperating it as follows. 20 gig for windows, 20 gig for ubuntu, and the rest a shared partition which can be accessed by either os?
2010-12-18T04:47:00.000Z	histo	cha0s2358	I would use gparted to resize your partitions. You need to boot off the instlal cd to resize the current runing drive.  The shared partition I would create an ntfs one.
2010-12-18T04:48:00.000Z	histo	cha0s2358	Keep in mind you can install a tool in windows to read linux partitions, and linux can already read your windows partition so there may not be a need to keep a seperate shared one.
2010-12-18T04:48:00.000Z	cha0s2358	histo	ok i already set it up in partitions but i dont know how to make the 280 gig partition available and readable by both os. i want applications and programs stored in the shared as well as multi media
2010-12-18T04:49:00.000Z	histo	cha0s2358	well ntfs will work for the shared partition without installing anything in windows.
2010-12-18T04:50:00.000Z	cha0s2358	histo	ok but still what i am asking is once i make it ntfs how do i tell windows to use the partition
2010-12-18T04:50:00.000Z	histo	cha0s2358	w2indows will see the partition in my computer automatically.   In linux you need to add it to /etc/fstab to have it mounted on boot
2010-12-18T04:51:00.000Z	cha0s2358	histo	ok cool deal
