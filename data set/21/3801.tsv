2008-09-19T01:27:00.000Z	ubuntutlups		thanks
2008-09-19T01:28:00.000Z	ubuntutlups		is there a way to download it from a torrent o amule...
2008-09-19T01:29:00.000Z	ubuntutlups		What is alternate desktop ?
2008-09-19T01:29:00.000Z	ubuntutlups		is a better version ? o whut ?
2008-09-19T01:29:00.000Z	kevinO	ubuntutlups	no lice desktop
2008-09-19T01:30:00.000Z	kevinO	ubuntutlups	i think your referring to the ubuntu alternate cd which doesnt include the live desktop ability
2008-09-19T01:30:00.000Z	kevinO	ubuntutlups	you have a slow connection?
2008-09-19T01:31:00.000Z	kevinO	ubuntutlups	then you might prefer the torrent it will ensure you get a complete and working image file
2008-09-19T01:32:00.000Z	ubuntutlups	kevinO	where can i donwload the oficial torrent  ?
2008-09-19T01:33:00.000Z	kevinO	ubuntutlups	youll also need a torrent manager, are you running windows or linux?
2008-09-19T01:34:00.000Z	kevinO	ubuntutlups	yes that is the laternate, you can see it in the filename
2008-09-19T01:35:00.000Z	kevinO	ubuntutlups	oh i thought you wanted the alternate cd
2008-09-19T01:36:00.000Z	kevinO	ubuntutlups	http://releases.ubuntu.com/8.04.1/ubuntu-8.04.1-alternate-i386.iso.torrent
2008-09-19T01:38:00.000Z	kevinO	ubuntutlups	you are confused. you said you have no need for the live cd. the live cd contains the live desktop. which means you can boot any computer from that disc.
2008-09-19T01:39:00.000Z	kevinO	ubuntutlups	the alternate link i sent you is still normal ubuntu
2008-09-19T01:39:00.000Z	kevinO	ubuntutlups	you just wont be able to run it from the cd
2008-09-19T01:39:00.000Z	kevinO	ubuntutlups	do you understand now?
2008-09-19T01:41:00.000Z	kevinO	ubuntutlups	yes
2008-09-19T01:41:00.000Z	kevinO	ubuntutlups	and it will install gnome as your desktop
2008-09-19T01:44:00.000Z	kevinO	ubuntutlups	no, you will get upgates though
