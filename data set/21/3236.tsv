2009-03-01T17:39:00.000Z	Incarus		<Dillizar>, the GraCa is working, but you have the wrong solution or what? any errors?
2009-03-01T17:39:00.000Z	Incarus		<DarkKnight>, yes, start over terminal
2009-03-01T17:40:00.000Z	Incarus		<DarkKnight>, no, just for generating the image
2009-03-01T17:41:00.000Z	Incarus		<DarkKnight>, i dont know the command, try "qemu --help"
2009-03-01T17:41:00.000Z	Incarus		<DarkKnight>, http://bellard.org/qemu/qemu-doc.html
2009-03-01T17:42:00.000Z	Incarus		<DizzyDoo>, i think "localhost"
2009-03-01T17:42:00.000Z	DizzyDoo	Incarus	what?
2009-03-01T18:26:00.000Z	Incarus	DizzyDoo	where do you need the static ip, in the router or in ubuntu?
2009-03-01T18:26:00.000Z	DizzyDoo	Incarus	the router requires a static IP.
2009-03-01T18:27:00.000Z	Incarus	DizzyDoo	a hostname from what? from the provider?
2009-03-01T18:29:00.000Z	Incarus	DizzyDoo	try "Localhost" as hostname
2009-03-01T18:29:00.000Z	Incarus	DizzyDoo	"localhost"
2009-03-01T18:29:00.000Z	DizzyDoo	Incarus	that does absolutely nothing.
2009-03-01T18:43:00.000Z	Incarus	DizzyDoo	simple configuration mistake
2009-03-01T18:44:00.000Z	DizzyDoo	Incarus	what are you talking about? I have done no configuration at all, as of yet. My original question was simply: "How do I find out my host name"
2009-03-01T18:46:00.000Z	DizzyDoo	Incarus	I never asked anything about Opera. You must mean something else
2009-03-01T18:46:00.000Z	Incarus	DizzyDoo	sorry, wrong name
