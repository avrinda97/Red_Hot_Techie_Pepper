2007-01-08T15:54:00.000Z	alink1000		I tried the ubuntu wikis, and got nothing to help with 7zip.
2007-01-08T15:54:00.000Z	alink1000		Anyone want to walk me through it? :)
2007-01-08T15:55:00.000Z	alink1000		I'd like to extract a 7z archive.
2007-01-08T15:55:00.000Z	alink1000		Super Mario World hacks to be specific. :)
2007-01-08T15:55:00.000Z	alink1000		is file roller in synaptic package manger?
2007-01-08T15:55:00.000Z	alink1000		*manager
2007-01-08T15:55:00.000Z	LjL	alink1000	file roller is installed by default. i think it's in the Accessories menu or something (dunno, i use KDE myself).
2007-01-08T15:56:00.000Z	LjL	alink1000	what you need to install is the "p7zip" package anyway
2007-01-08T15:57:00.000Z	LjL	alink1000	well, aside from what is in the manual page, i cannot say much if you don't give me some more information about the problem. is there an error?
2007-01-08T15:58:00.000Z	LjL	alink1000	uh? so you didn't just try "p7zip -d filename" from a console?
2007-01-08T16:01:00.000Z	LjL	alink1000	what had you typed, exactly?
2007-01-08T16:02:00.000Z	LjL	alink1000	ah. no space in filenames. either use quotation marks, or use "\ " instead of " "
2007-01-08T16:10:00.000Z	LjL	alink1000	you're welcome, but no need to spam :)
2007-01-08T16:07:00.000Z	LjL	alink1000	if the file is located on the desktop, you need to cd to the desktop. or whatever relevant directory it is located in
2007-01-08T16:07:00.000Z	LjL	alink1000	"cd"
2007-01-08T16:08:00.000Z	LjL	alink1000	so, is the file on the desktop?
2007-01-08T16:09:00.000Z	LjL	alink1000	then "cd ~/Desktop", then "p7zip -d Super<TAB>"  (meaning, hit TAB after typing that)
