2008-01-18T19:37:00.000Z	erUSUL	Lartza_	sudo eject /dev/dvd
2008-01-18T19:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	Lartza_	or whichever the dev file it is
2008-01-18T19:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	Lartza_	no afaics
2008-01-18T19:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	Lartza_	post your dmesg to paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2008-01-18T19:59:00.000Z	Lartza_	erUSUL	here http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/52421/
2008-01-18T20:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	Lartza_	sudo eject /dev/hdc failed? error msg?
2008-01-18T20:02:00.000Z	Lartza_	erUSUL	no erro, opens my cdrw drive
2008-01-18T20:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	Lartza_	that's the only drive i see recognized on the dmesg. Are you sure the dvd is well plugged (ide and power)
2008-01-18T20:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	Lartza_	hda and hdb are hard disk the only optical drive is hdc: PLEXTOR CD-R PX-W1610A, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
2008-01-18T20:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	Lartza_	so the other drive is not detected for some reason
2008-01-18T20:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	Lartza_	only one drive for each device file and viceversa
2008-01-18T20:09:00.000Z	Lartza_	erUSUL	where should my jumper be?
2008-01-18T20:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	Lartza_	you have the two optical drives on the same ide cable? if so check that both have their jumpers set to cable select or that one is master and the other slave
2008-01-18T20:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	Lartza_	also check power connectors etc
2008-01-18T20:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	Lartza_	also as other said check if they are recogniced in the bios
2008-02-22T16:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	Lartza_	o.O!! if you stop a driver what would drive your card ??
2009-04-07T17:37:00.000Z	erUSUL	Lartza_	i do not see whay not
2009-04-08T18:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	Lartza_	sudo lshw | less
2009-08-09T19:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	Lartza_	OMG this can't be so hard <<< writte the driver yourself then. i'm quite sure you will make many people happy. if you are not a programmer pay someone to writte it for you and release it as gpl. You got a complete OS for free giving back and easy tiny driver would be a way to pay back. ;P
