2006-01-01T17:20:00.000Z	imc_		Hey, I'm in Germany running breezy (which I normally run in the states) and I have trouble logging into public wifi networks. I can pull IP addresses but not get out to even see the welcome page. this happened on T-Mobile and WLAM:802 (another commercial service) is this a known issue?
2006-01-01T17:21:00.000Z	imc_		Anyone on German wifi?
2006-01-01T17:23:00.000Z	imc_		And the answer seems to be, "In Germany it don't work"
2006-01-01T17:23:00.000Z	imc_		:)
2006-01-01T17:24:00.000Z	imc_		Seriously, I can pull an IP address but I cannot get a browser to pull the start page, nor can I ping things like yahoo.com
2006-01-01T17:24:00.000Z	imc_		I use this same machine in several countries but this is the first time in germany - and the first time I have had problems/
2006-01-01T17:25:00.000Z	kemik	imc_	 you've got a working DNS server ?
2006-01-01T17:25:00.000Z	imc_	kemik	- can't see it. I ran ifconfig and see my ip, broadcast and mask
2006-01-01T17:25:00.000Z	imc_		I sign on with DHCP so I assume they take care of it?
2006-01-01T17:26:00.000Z	kemik	imc_	 cat /etc/resolv.conf
2006-01-01T17:27:00.000Z	imc_	kemik	right, it's only specifying search local  at 127.0.0.1
2006-01-01T17:27:00.000Z	imc_		But that's now, on this wired connection, kemik
2006-01-01T17:28:00.000Z	kemik	imc_	 well you should have some nameserver entries aswell. (and not 127.0.0.1 in search..)
2006-01-01T17:29:00.000Z	imc_	kemik	and Marcin, righto. Thanks. Any suggestions about ba name server I can specify in resolv.conf which I can use here in Germany>
2006-01-01T17:29:00.000Z	imc_		?
2006-01-01T17:29:00.000Z	kemik	imc_	 the root-dns servers perhaps ;)
2006-01-01T17:29:00.000Z	kemik		hiih
2006-01-01T17:29:00.000Z	imc_		Doh!
2006-01-01T17:29:00.000Z	imc_		Thanks kemik and marcin!
2006-01-01T17:29:00.000Z	kemik	imc_	 i can lend you mine, not sure it'll work tho
2006-01-01T17:30:00.000Z	kemik	imc_	 see privmsg
