2011-07-05T18:32:00.000Z	glda19		what is the standard name of the gnome panels
2011-07-05T18:32:00.000Z	edbian	glda19	gnome-panel
2011-07-05T18:33:00.000Z	glda19	edbian	can you do somthing for me
2011-07-05T18:33:00.000Z	edbian	glda19	maybe
2011-07-05T18:35:00.000Z	edbian	glda19	right click the bottom one, click add new panel
2011-07-05T18:37:00.000Z	edbian	glda19	Can you elaborate?  What specifically are you doing that isn't working?
2011-07-05T18:38:00.000Z	edbian	glda19	You can add those icons to the panel you do have.  It's called main menu
2011-07-05T18:39:00.000Z	edbian	glda19	I'm not sure why adding cairo dock would remove a panel, you could stop using cairo
2011-07-05T18:39:00.000Z	edbian	glda19	no panels at all?
2011-07-05T18:40:00.000Z	edbian	glda19	Do you have a gnome-panel process running?
2011-07-05T18:41:00.000Z	edbian	glda19	using ps -e or the gnome system-monitor GUI
2011-07-05T18:43:00.000Z	edbian	glda19	then run gnome-panel   in a terminal to turn them back on.  It might kill cairo-dock
2011-07-05T18:45:00.000Z	glda19	edbian	thy  are back
2011-07-05T18:45:00.000Z	edbian	glda19	fixed?
2011-07-05T18:45:00.000Z	glda19	edbian	yes
2011-07-05T18:45:00.000Z	edbian	glda19	Glad I could help :)
2011-07-05T18:46:00.000Z	edbian	glda19	For the record.  removing cairo dock and restarting would have also worked
2011-07-05T18:46:00.000Z	glda19	edbian	how can i test it that the gnome-panels are working with out reboot
2011-07-05T18:47:00.000Z	edbian	glda19	Are they working now?  I'm confused what you're asking
2011-07-05T18:48:00.000Z	glda19	edbian	where can i set how is automaticly loged in
2011-07-05T18:49:00.000Z	edbian	glda19	I'm not sure.  I would just reboot and see what starts.  I'm guessing it'll start whatever was running when you logged out last.
