2008-09-07T03:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	maxflax	i think the apps you run will be captured by the gnome panels
2011-09-03T20:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	maxflax	you can use the LiveCD to reinstate the MBR easily
2011-09-03T20:13:00.000Z	maxflax	ActionParsnip	it doesn't boot my install disk anymore.. had a USB disk to boot from.. now it only gets black screen and blinking cursor

2011-09-03T20:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	maxflax	add the boot option:  nouveau.blacklist=1
2011-09-03T20:15:00.000Z	maxflax	ActionParsnip	problem is that I don't even get that far so I can adjust the boot options
2011-09-03T20:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	maxflax	you do, you just need to know how
2011-09-03T20:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	maxflax	grub is on the CD, which then loads the OS.
2011-09-03T20:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	maxflax	I advised nouveau.blacklist=1    did I not?
2011-12-02T02:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	maxflax	set different TCP_SOCKET options in /etc/samba/smb.conf
2011-12-02T02:27:00.000Z	maxflax	ActionParsnip	Explain a little closer what u mean..  what diffrent should I set and how does it affect speed?
2011-12-02T02:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	maxflax	there are a tonne of options you can add, there are sampls online, you change them on the server side, you'll need to restart the smbd service to apply the settings'
2012-03-25T04:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	maxflax	the module it uses may have the option to disable power management
2012-03-25T04:28:00.000Z	maxflax	ActionParsnip	Yeah, I can easily turn it off with iwconfig eth0 power off but I want it in boot so I dont have to do it manually every time
2012-03-25T04:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	maxflax	add it in /etc/rc.local above the exit 0 line
2012-03-25T04:37:00.000Z	maxflax	ActionParsnip	ok so putting "/sbin/iwconfig eth0 power off" in rc.local should do the trick?
2012-03-25T04:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	maxflax	yeah should do
2012-03-25T04:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	maxflax	all I can say is try it
