2005-03-18T17:14:00.000Z	soulhack		the basic installation guide, from WinXP to Ubuntu, where can I find this? Is it this: http://www.ubuntulinux.org/support/documentation/howto/helpcenterhowto.2005-02-28.6671204877
2005-03-18T17:15:00.000Z	soulhack		i am completely new to linux, so I did have some troubles with getting stuff right to be honest.
2005-03-18T17:15:00.000Z	soulhack		I didnt find any guide on the cd
2005-03-18T17:16:00.000Z	soulhack		yea, i am looking atm

2005-03-18T17:22:00.000Z	lunitik	soulhack	1.7 gigs
2005-03-18T17:22:00.000Z	lunitik	soulhack	recommend at least 3 though
2005-03-18T17:22:00.000Z	lunitik	soulhack	else there is no room for play, thats no good  :P
2005-03-18T17:22:00.000Z	lunitik	soulhack	sorta... would be ok though
2005-03-18T17:24:00.000Z	lunitik	soulhack	nah... no need
2005-03-18T17:26:00.000Z	lunitik	soulhack	the installer, by default I think, will get rid of it...
2005-03-18T17:41:00.000Z	lunitik	soulhack	you're over thinking this... just throw the CD in, and hit enter a few times.
2005-03-18T17:41:00.000Z	lunitik	soulhack	seriously, if you don't want Windows... thats a pretty safe way to install Ubuntu/
2005-03-18T17:42:00.000Z	lunitik	soulhack	yet its considered one of the hardest installs around... I had my aunts dog install it once  :P
2005-03-18T17:43:00.000Z	lunitik	soulhack	only part I had to help with was username and hostname... his paws were too big  :(
2005-03-18T17:44:00.000Z	lunitik	soulhack	he's being sarcastic... WIndows 98 was infamous for crashing when you least wanted it to.
2005-03-18T17:45:00.000Z	lunitik	soulhack	you just need a restart button  :/
2005-03-18T17:49:00.000Z	lunitik	soulhack	what app are you using?
2005-03-18T17:50:00.000Z	lunitik	soulhack	ahh... never used that... ever used burn4free... its nice... and has never failed me... just have to click 'burn iso' and voila
2005-03-18T17:51:00.000Z	lunitik	soulhack	gah... file menu... mid way down... something like raw burn or burn image or something...
2005-03-18T17:52:00.000Z	lunitik	soulhack	I read something different, my bad
