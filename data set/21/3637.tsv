2008-11-24T06:44:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	Samuel-NotAFK	it identifies the disk by saerching for hidden files on the CD. if these are also present on the USB disk it should find it too
2008-11-24T06:45:00.000Z	Samuel-NotAFK	zsquareplusc	Well it doesn't.
2008-11-24T06:46:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	Samuel-NotAFK	is there a ".disk" folder?
2008-11-24T06:47:00.000Z	Samuel-NotAFK	zsquareplusc	Yes
2008-11-24T06:47:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	Samuel-NotAFK	hm. do you have suck a folder on a partition in the pc you want to install? maybe it identifies the wrong device as "live cd"..
2008-11-24T06:47:00.000Z	Samuel-NotAFK	zsquareplusc	And all the files are in that directory.
2008-11-24T06:48:00.000Z	Samuel-NotAFK	zsquareplusc	No.
2008-11-24T06:48:00.000Z	Samuel-NotAFK	zsquareplusc	It doesn't detect any device.
2008-11-24T06:49:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	Samuel-NotAFK	well as it boots the live version it actually seems to find the disk. it's only the installer that fails later. i think i've read a bug about that some time ago
2008-11-24T06:50:00.000Z	Samuel-NotAFK	zsquareplusc	The live version works but I want to encrypt my laptop
2008-11-24T06:51:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	Samuel-NotAFK	ah, if you want to install on encrypted partitons right away, i think you have to use the alternate-cd to install
2008-11-24T06:52:00.000Z	Samuel-NotAFK	zsquareplusc	I do but it doesn't work.
2008-11-24T06:52:00.000Z	Samuel-NotAFK	zsquareplusc	I don't have a CD drive.
2008-11-24T06:55:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	Samuel-NotAFK	hm. there are other ways. for example there is also a harddisk image that you can copy to a partition and boot to run the installer. or network boot, but that more coplex to set up a server
2008-11-24T06:56:00.000Z	Samuel-NotAFK	zsquareplusc	Those sound overly complicated and silly when I have a USB drive.
2008-11-24T06:56:00.000Z	Samuel-NotAFK	zsquareplusc	The installer doesn't support my wireless card either.
2008-11-24T06:57:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	Samuel-NotAFK	the harddisk image has chances to boot off the usb stick :-)
2008-11-24T06:57:00.000Z	Samuel-NotAFK	zsquareplusc	hmmm yeah
2008-11-24T06:57:00.000Z	Samuel-NotAFK	zsquareplusc	I know what you mean now, I've done it before.
2008-11-24T06:57:00.000Z	Samuel-NotAFK	zsquareplusc	I'll do it tomorrow, I need sleep now.
