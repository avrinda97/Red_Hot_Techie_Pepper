2010-06-13T00:16:00.000Z	evon		does anyone know the terminal command to check how big a particular directory (including subdirectories)?
2010-06-13T00:16:00.000Z	unop	evon	du -sh your_dir/
2010-06-13T00:17:00.000Z	evon	unop	if i don't put the directory will it just check the current directory?
2010-06-13T00:17:00.000Z	unop	evon	no, for that supply . instead
2010-06-13T00:18:00.000Z	unop	evon	actually, yes, if you don't specify a dir, it does check the current dir.
2010-06-13T00:18:00.000Z	evon	unop	thanks a bunch man
2010-06-13T00:20:00.000Z	evon	unop	is there a command for getting the computer to detect hardware again or do i have to restart?
2010-06-13T00:20:00.000Z	unop	evon	to do what exactly?
2010-06-13T00:20:00.000Z	evon	unop	nevermind i got actually
2010-06-13T00:21:00.000Z	evon	unop	I just had to wait a sec
2010-06-13T00:23:00.000Z	evon	unop	if i type "cp /directorya /directoryb" will it copy everything including subdirectories?
2010-06-13T00:23:00.000Z	unop	evon	 cp -a dira/ dirb/
2010-06-13T00:27:00.000Z	evon	unop	sorry to trouble you again. I've typed it but nothing is seemingly happening. does the terminal not give any kind of progress indicator?
2010-06-13T00:28:00.000Z	unop	evon	not cp no, but if you add a -v it tells you which file it's copied
2010-06-13T00:29:00.000Z	unop	evon	if you have rsync installed. you can do.   rsync -av --progress dira/ dirb/
2010-06-13T00:32:00.000Z	evon	unop	automatically replace files?
2010-06-13T00:33:00.000Z	unop	evon	rsync is smart, it compares already existing files in the destination and copies them only if they're older
2010-06-13T00:33:00.000Z	evon	unop	ok i will check it out
2010-06-13T00:34:00.000Z	evon	unop	alright i used the -u option. thanks again for your help
2010-06-13T00:34:00.000Z	unop	evon	is this with cp? you mean -v ?
2010-06-13T00:35:00.000Z	unop	evon	because -u does something else - probably what you want anyway
