2009-01-27T15:54:00.000Z	phorensic	ActionParsnip	can you pipe the output of pwd so that it becomes the parameters of gksudo nautilus??
2009-01-27T15:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phorensic	you could use nautilus 'pwd' &
2009-01-27T15:55:00.000Z	phorensic	ActionParsnip	IE gksudo nautilus <directory obtained from pwd>
2009-01-27T15:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phorensic	much like kernel-header-'uname -r'
2009-01-27T15:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phorensic	what will work is nautilus ./
2009-01-27T15:55:00.000Z	phorensic	ActionParsnip	haven't really used that at all besides copy/paste days ago
2009-01-27T15:56:00.000Z	phorensic	ActionParsnip	ahhhh very good .. I would like to get used to piping things and stuff, still fairly new to the terminal but I'm slowly understanding the concepts and slowly starting to useit more and more
2009-01-27T15:57:00.000Z	phorensic	ActionParsnip	so entering a command within ' ' will return the value of that command to use as the action? pretty cool. Was the & supposed to be at the end of that example you gave me?
2009-01-27T15:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phorensic	as far as i'm aware
2009-01-27T15:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phorensic	kernel-headers-`uname -a | cut -f 3 -d' '`
2009-01-27T15:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phorensic	just grabbed that off a site
2009-01-27T15:59:00.000Z	phorensic	ActionParsnip	wtf does that do?
2009-01-27T16:00:00.000Z	phorensic	ActionParsnip	ahhh
2009-01-27T16:01:00.000Z	phorensic	ActionParsnip	yah its been so long since I messed with that, I usually just keep updated with the repos, plus never compiled my own kernel.. any time i dealt with headers I was following a tutorial
2009-01-27T16:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phorensic	true but yeah the command gets run first, its quite handy for scripts
2009-01-27T16:02:00.000Z	phorensic	ActionParsnip	is the uuid basically like a unique serial for a piece of hardware?
2009-01-27T16:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phorensic	gdm start
2009-01-27T16:20:00.000Z	phorensic	ActionParsnip	there isn't like a sudo /etc/gdm.init start or something???
2009-01-27T16:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phorensic	or it might be just gdm, it needs to be run as user
2009-01-27T16:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phorensic	try both
