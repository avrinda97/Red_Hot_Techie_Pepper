2011-07-25T15:58:00.000Z	Kartagis	pindropper	replace as needed
2011-07-25T15:58:00.000Z	pindropper	Kartagis	thanks!
2011-07-25T16:00:00.000Z	Kartagis	pindropper	np
2011-07-25T16:04:00.000Z	pindropper	Kartagis	follow up question: The link assumes I have already installed php5 . I have a fresh machine with nothing installed. Would the process be the same? I mean is there something like apt-get install php5.2 ? I am sorry to ask again, but this is all very new to me.
2011-07-25T16:05:00.000Z	Kartagis	pindropper	then skip the steps which assume you have php 5.3
2011-07-25T16:05:00.000Z	pindropper	Kartagis	ok. thanks.
2011-07-25T17:32:00.000Z	pindropper	Kartagis	hi again. Ok so I did as was described on the page and it worked. i now have php 5.2 installed and it works perfectly. But I am trying to install phpmyadmin and it says it depends on php5-mycrypt which when i try to install says it depends on some php-cgi... which when i try to install it says its an abstract package that is provided by some php 5.3 packages. what to do?
2011-07-25T17:33:00.000Z	Kartagis	pindropper	get the tarball of phpmyadmin
2011-07-25T17:33:00.000Z	Kartagis	pindropper	www.phpmyadmin.net
2011-07-25T17:34:00.000Z	pindropper	Kartagis	ok. then install manually? never done it. ok lemme try.
2011-07-25T17:34:00.000Z	Kartagis	pindropper	all you have to is (I've done it) extract it under /var/www
2011-07-25T17:34:00.000Z	pindropper	Kartagis	thats it?
2011-07-25T17:35:00.000Z	Kartagis	pindropper	I've done that
2011-07-25T17:35:00.000Z	pindropper	Kartagis	ok. lemme try.
2011-07-25T17:35:00.000Z	Kartagis	pindropper	then log on with your mysql root
2011-07-25T17:35:00.000Z	pindropper	Kartagis	ok.
2011-07-25T17:36:00.000Z	pindropper	Kartagis	/var/www would be where my public_html is right? because i have my site configured to run from /srv/www/mysite/ should i put it there?
2011-07-25T17:37:00.000Z	Kartagis	pindropper	put it under /srv/www/mysite then, /var/www/ is default
2011-07-25T17:37:00.000Z	pindropper	Kartagis	ok. just being sure. thanks.
