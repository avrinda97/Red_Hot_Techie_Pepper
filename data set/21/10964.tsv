2004-10-06T11:07:00.000Z	crimsun		haven't /names'd in a while
2004-10-06T11:09:00.000Z	daniels	crimsun	hello
2004-11-21T16:08:00.000Z	crimsun	daniels	just a note: the migration of /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 => /etc/X11/xorg.conf needs to change  Driver "keyboard"  to  Driver "kbd"
2004-11-21T16:09:00.000Z	daniels	crimsun	it doesn't *need* to, it just *should*
2004-11-21T16:10:00.000Z	crimsun	daniels	fair enough. I presume since the dexconf markers weren't present in my /etc/X11/XF86Config-4, that wasn't done.
2004-11-21T16:18:00.000Z	daniels	crimsun	right
2005-01-14T11:34:00.000Z	crimsun	daniels	the 'nv' one?
2005-01-14T11:34:00.000Z	daniels	crimsun	yeah
2005-01-28T14:49:00.000Z	crimsun	daniels	he was trying it for Xorg
2005-02-11T08:02:00.000Z	crimsun	daniels	may I bug you for 30 secs regarding X.Org in Hoary, usb 1.1, and the evdev protocol for driver mouse?
2005-02-11T08:06:00.000Z	daniels	crimsun	sure
2005-02-11T08:08:00.000Z	crimsun	daniels	thanks. I have an odd local config where a usb 1.1 hub times out, which causes havoc with my mouse in that /dev/input/event[34]  are continually interchanged between X sessions, so I have to reconfigure /etc/X11/xorg.conf and restart gdm every couple hours. Should I be yelling at the kernel folks, or should I just give up and go back to using /dev/input/mice with protocol "auto"?
2005-02-11T08:09:00.000Z	daniels	crimsun	one way to do it is to have a script that hotplug calls to manage /dev/mouseX (or whatever) symlinks, and then you can kill X with SIGUSR2 to get it to reload all its input devices when the symlink target changes
2005-02-11T08:09:00.000Z	daniels	crimsun	a woeful hack, but it works
2005-02-11T08:10:00.000Z	crimsun	daniels	excellent, thanks for the advice.
2005-02-11T08:10:00.000Z	daniels	crimsun	no worries
2005-03-31T07:14:00.000Z	crimsun	daniels	my thoughts as well, save ifconfig ath0 doesn't show anything
2005-03-31T07:16:00.000Z	crimsun	daniels	ah!
2005-07-15T11:11:00.000Z	daniels	crimsun	oh, sorry, didn't see our +q
2005-07-15T11:11:00.000Z	crimsun	daniels	np
