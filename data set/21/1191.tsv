2011-01-02T23:03:00.000Z	P4G0		hmm found nothing usable... is there any place to search through other repositories?
2011-01-02T23:05:00.000Z	P4G0		is there any alternative to AUFS? i want to merge multiple hdds without raid
2011-01-02T23:05:00.000Z	P4G0		ah nope
2011-01-02T23:06:00.000Z	P4G0		i want to combine multiple hdds... but when one hdd fails the others should still be intact
2011-01-02T23:06:00.000Z	P4G0		oh noo
2011-01-02T23:06:00.000Z	P4G0		no raid :)
2011-01-02T23:06:00.000Z	P4G0		hmm how should i explain in a frew words
2011-01-02T23:08:00.000Z	P4G0		with AUFS you have multiple hdds with own filesystems. AUFS combines them to one virtual filesystem. when writing to the aufs-fs AUFS writes the data completely to exactly ONE hdd
2011-01-02T23:08:00.000Z	P4G0		in addition you could tell aufs to "round-robin" when writing data, so file1 goes to hdd1, file2 to hdd2 and so on...
2011-01-02T23:08:00.000Z	txomon	P4G0	have you thought about making another partition tble?
2011-01-02T23:09:00.000Z	P4G0	txomon	why another partition table?
2011-01-02T23:10:00.000Z	P4G0	txomon	but not with AUFS ;)
2011-01-02T23:12:00.000Z	txomon	P4G0	what for?
2011-01-02T23:13:00.000Z	P4G0	txomon	i want to build a huge and expandable file storage
2011-01-02T23:13:00.000Z	txomon	P4G0	the best thing is to mount them in different folders, so that u can move them
2011-01-02T23:14:00.000Z	P4G0	txomon	ah no thats even not usable for me
2011-01-02T23:15:00.000Z	txomon	P4G0	^^ i also wanted for that, and I discovered that it is better to classify them by name than unifying them
2011-01-02T23:16:00.000Z	P4G0	txomon	it has to be one big folder, because MediaPortal is only accepting one folder for recordings... i could move them, but i don't want to
2011-01-02T23:17:00.000Z	txomon	P4G0	make an script that moves them
2011-01-02T23:22:00.000Z	txomon	P4G0	have u considered making the script?
2011-01-02T23:22:00.000Z	P4G0	txomon	no it's no option for me
