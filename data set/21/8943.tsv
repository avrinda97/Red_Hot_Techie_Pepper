2006-10-30T09:27:00.000Z	HaroldJohnson		Morning, all
2006-10-30T09:27:00.000Z	HaroldJohnson		How do I display metadata of a file?
2006-10-30T09:27:00.000Z	nrdb	HaroldJohnson	it 2:27am here
2006-10-30T09:28:00.000Z	HaroldJohnson	nrdb	That's morning, isn't it?
2006-10-30T09:28:00.000Z	HaroldJohnson	nrdb	:)
2006-10-30T09:28:00.000Z	nrdb	HaroldJohnson	yes I suppose, I think of it more as a late night.
2006-10-30T09:29:00.000Z	HaroldJohnson	nrdb	Ah yes
2006-10-30T09:29:00.000Z	HaroldJohnson	nrdb	How do you display the metadata of a file or directory?
2006-10-30T09:30:00.000Z	nrdb	HaroldJohnson	no idea sorry
2006-10-30T09:30:00.000Z	HaroldJohnson	nrdb	That's okay.  Morning/Evening to you, anyway!
2006-10-30T09:32:00.000Z	HaroldJohnson	nrdb	Probably -- but there's hardly any viruses on Linux
2006-10-30T09:33:00.000Z	nrdb	HaroldJohnson	ok thanks.  my boss is a little paranoid about the subject.
2006-10-30T09:33:00.000Z	HaroldJohnson	nrdb	As is his wont
2006-10-30T09:34:00.000Z	HaroldJohnson	nrdb	Linux has no viruses
2006-10-30T09:34:00.000Z	HaroldJohnson	nrdb	I mean...
2006-10-30T09:34:00.000Z	HaroldJohnson	nrdb	...if Linux has any viruses, they are so few as to hardly call them viruses...
2006-10-30T09:34:00.000Z	HaroldJohnson	nrdb	...no matter whether on a PC or a Mac.
2006-10-30T09:35:00.000Z	HaroldJohnson	nrdb	I would *guess* that viruses on a Mac would be less, since there are so many less Macs running Linux (and therefore, not much incentrive for virus programmers).
2006-10-30T09:35:00.000Z	nrdb	HaroldJohnson	I know there aren't many but I thought I would ask anyway.
2006-10-30T09:35:00.000Z	HaroldJohnson	nrdb	Of course.
2006-10-30T09:35:00.000Z	HaroldJohnson	nrdb	I'm not expert, btw
