2008-02-25T23:08:00.000Z	MindSpark		hi, I tried adding a user to a group, but it just doesn't work
2008-02-25T23:08:00.000Z	nickrud	MindSpark	that user has to log out completely for the new group to be recognized
2008-02-25T23:09:00.000Z	MindSpark	nickrud	already did so
2008-02-25T23:09:00.000Z	MindSpark		I added it from commandline
2008-02-25T23:09:00.000Z	MindSpark		using gpasswd
2008-02-25T23:09:00.000Z	nickrud	MindSpark	did you log out of the gui?
2008-02-25T23:09:00.000Z	MindSpark	nickrud	no, just the shell
2008-02-25T23:10:00.000Z	nickrud	MindSpark	completely means completely
2008-02-25T23:10:00.000Z	MindSpark	nickrud	ok, thanks, brb
2008-02-25T23:13:00.000Z	MindSpark	nickrud	works perfectly, thanks, but why is it so ?
2008-02-25T23:14:00.000Z	nickrud	MindSpark	don't really know the cause, just that it's 'always been that way'
2008-02-25T23:14:00.000Z	MindSpark	nickrud	only on ubuntu though, eh ?
2008-02-25T23:14:00.000Z	nickrud	MindSpark	no, linux wide
2008-02-25T23:15:00.000Z	MindSpark		groups and user info is independent of X
2008-02-25T23:16:00.000Z	nickrud	MindSpark	filesystem, below X. If you'd had another console shell open, you still wouldn't be recognized as part of that group
2008-02-25T23:16:00.000Z	MindSpark	nickrud	yes, but X doesn't run on shell, does it ?
2008-02-25T23:17:00.000Z	nickrud	MindSpark	the user is active. That's the key, not shell, or anything else. Try creating a test group, and having two shells open.
2008-02-25T23:18:00.000Z	MindSpark	nickrud	ahuh, doesn't update until user is logged out from everything eh ?
2008-02-25T23:18:00.000Z	nickrud	MindSpark	correct
2008-02-25T23:18:00.000Z	MindSpark	nickrud	alright, thanks. You never stop learning anything with linux I guess.
2008-02-25T23:19:00.000Z	nickrud	MindSpark	daily myself
