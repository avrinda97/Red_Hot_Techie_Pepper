2005-04-28T06:38:00.000Z	dave__		hi, just installedubuntu, im a new linux user so dont know much, i downloaded xmms to play my mp3's, which i can see via my windows network, but when i try to ./configure, it says i have no c compiler
2005-04-28T06:39:00.000Z	lunitik	dave__	'apt-get install build-essential'
2005-04-28T06:39:00.000Z	lunitik	dave__	but why are you compiling xmms?
2005-04-28T06:40:00.000Z	lunitik	dave__	type 'apt-get install xmms-mad' ... make sure universe is enabled though...
2005-04-28T06:42:00.000Z	lunitik	dave__	installing xmms-mad will also install xmms... but give you mp3 support right away
2005-04-28T06:42:00.000Z	lunitik	dave__	instead of installing xmms first, then xmms-mad when you figure out you need it  ;)
2005-04-28T06:43:00.000Z	lunitik	dave__	you know how to enable universe?
2005-04-28T06:44:00.000Z	lunitik	dave__	it is where xmms-mad is...
2005-04-28T06:44:00.000Z	lunitik	dave__	just find the 'deb' line that lists universe at the end
2005-04-28T06:45:00.000Z	lunitik	dave__	gah... in /etc/apt/sources.list... but maybe you shouldn't be editing that yourself...
2005-04-28T06:46:00.000Z	lunitik	dave__	in System > Administration > Synaptic Package Manager ... go to Settings > Repository and look for the first listing for 'universe'... make sure it is on
2005-04-28T06:50:00.000Z	dave__	lunitik	im the package mananger and i go to setting srepositories and then i see no universe thing?!
2005-04-28T06:51:00.000Z	lunitik	dave__	^^
2005-04-28T07:06:00.000Z	lunitik	dave__	they should Just Work (tm)  ... only way to find out is to try though  ;)
2005-04-28T07:07:00.000Z	lunitik	dave__	my digital camera has Just Worked everywhere I've used it though for a while
2005-04-28T07:07:00.000Z	lunitik	dave__	you already have a messenger that supports AIM ICQ Y! MSN and a few others  ;)
2005-04-28T07:08:00.000Z	lunitik	dave__	Applications > Internet > Gaim Internet Messenger
2005-04-28T07:09:00.000Z	lunitik	dave__	came to the right place for help though  :)
2005-04-28T07:12:00.000Z	lunitik	dave__	Gentoo is definitly not the place to start your Linux experience... takes you back about 10 years to how you used to have to install  :/
2005-04-28T07:12:00.000Z	lunitik	dave__	well, not quite as bad as it was back then... but not far off...
2005-04-28T07:12:00.000Z	lunitik	dave__	whoever recommended Gentoo to you, you should personally strangle  ;)
