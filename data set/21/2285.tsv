2009-11-17T19:07:00.000Z	SmokeyD		hey everyone, is there a way to show cpu load and memory usage over time in a graph in the commandline or using a webbased app somehow in linux?
2009-11-17T19:07:00.000Z	SmokeyD		I want to monitor it on my server
2009-11-17T19:08:00.000Z	divider	SmokeyD	yes you can use the built in tools by right clicking on the top bar and selecting add to panel
2009-11-17T19:08:00.000Z	SmokeyD	divider	I am not using Xorg, but only commandline, that Is why I asked for commandline tools or webbased tools
2009-11-17T19:09:00.000Z	divider	SmokeyD	so your looking for an SSH compatible sysmonitor?
2009-11-17T19:10:00.000Z	SmokeyD	divider	either in the commandline, or through a webinterface or something.
2009-11-17T19:11:00.000Z	divider	SmokeyD	you can build a perlscript / php script to relay thru apache, or you can use ssh with a certain program. give me a minute to lookup the name.
2009-11-17T22:46:00.000Z	divider	SmokeyD	are you using VLC?
2009-11-17T22:44:00.000Z	divider	SmokeyD	 change your video output to X11
2009-11-17T22:45:00.000Z	SmokeyD	divider	where should I change that?
2009-11-17T22:46:00.000Z	SmokeyD	divider	as I said: kaffeine, movie player, all of them
2009-11-17T22:46:00.000Z	SmokeyD	divider	the "movie player" in ubuntu turns out to be totem
2009-11-17T22:47:00.000Z	divider	SmokeyD	sudo apt-get install vlc
2009-11-17T22:47:00.000Z	SmokeyD	divider	vlc is the only program that works?
2009-11-17T22:49:00.000Z	divider	SmokeyD	vlc is the best video player on the market, it plays anything without fail.
2009-11-17T22:49:00.000Z	SmokeyD	divider	thanks for your help, but it is not the answer I am looking for. I am having a problem with totem/kaffeine/etc
2009-11-17T22:49:00.000Z	divider	SmokeyD	you can also you it as a streaming media server for your network, and use it as webcam testing program. :P
2009-11-17T22:50:00.000Z	divider	SmokeyD	did you install the GStreamer Codecs?
2009-11-17T22:55:00.000Z	SmokeyD	divider	I found the solution, the problem also existed with vlc
2009-11-17T22:57:00.000Z	divider	SmokeyD	did you disable compiz? lol
2009-11-17T22:58:00.000Z	SmokeyD	divider	the x11 settings were the ones which were messed up by upgrading. There the hue was set way off
