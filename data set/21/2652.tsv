2009-08-05T21:17:00.000Z	guntbert	babbio	you don't need sudo for ssh
2009-08-05T21:17:00.000Z	babbio	guntbert	i need it for the rsa key privileges
2009-08-05T21:19:00.000Z	babbio		so....how to pass the password to the ssh command???
2009-08-05T21:19:00.000Z	guntbert	babbio	that doesn't make sense for me, you crate your rsa key (without sudo), put it into your .ssh/ and use it thereafter
2009-08-05T21:19:00.000Z	guntbert		*create
2009-08-05T21:20:00.000Z	babbio		<guntbert> ok but let's suppose that i don't need to call ssh via sudo....but i have to insert the password for the rsa key...so the problem is the same....how to automatically send the password to the command????
2009-08-05T21:21:00.000Z	babbio		nobody can help me???
2009-08-05T21:22:00.000Z	guntbert	babbio	thats where ssh-agent comes to the rescue, or you could store the passphrase in gnome-keyring
2009-08-05T21:22:00.000Z	guntbert		!patience | babbio
2009-08-05T21:23:00.000Z	babbio	guntbert	ok but you're not answering me....suppose we have a command which take a string as input....how to pass the string not by keybord but automatically????
2009-08-05T21:24:00.000Z	guntbert	babbio	we are talking about ssh, right and you have been given several possibilties - please try them
2009-08-05T21:25:00.000Z	guntbert	babbio	passwords on the command line are regarded highly unsecure (everyone else on the same machine could read them)
2009-08-05T21:26:00.000Z	babbio	guntbert	you are not giving me possibilities because the rsa key is not created by me but my teacher so i HAVE TO insert the password every time i want to connect to my school
2009-08-05T21:26:00.000Z	babbio	guntbert	the machine you are talking about is my personal laptop so nobody can use it
2009-08-05T21:27:00.000Z	guntbert	babbio	I gave you two possibilities: 1) use ssh-agent, 2) put the passphrase into your gnome-keyring
2009-08-05T21:27:00.000Z	guntbert	babbio	still the same - ssh doesn't accept passwords from the command line
2009-08-05T21:29:00.000Z	babbio		i use ssh and insert password for the connection every single day since 4 months
2009-08-05T21:29:00.000Z	babbio		so....ssh accept password
2009-08-05T21:30:00.000Z	guntbert	babbio	*not* from the command line but with its own prompt
