2007-07-10T11:40:00.000Z	macogw	numus	linux doesnt have a startbar
2007-07-10T11:41:00.000Z	macogw	numus	if you mean the pre-alpha kiba dock, google for it
2007-07-10T11:41:00.000Z	macogw	numus	kiba is a dock (like on a mac) with a physics engine. i assume it's what you're talking about.  the icons can fly all over the screen?
2007-07-10T12:07:00.000Z	macogw	numus	if you change your window manager's settings
2007-07-10T12:08:00.000Z	macogw	numus	on beyrl there's options of always-centered, normal, or intelligent (i think....) which puts it in wherever's empty
2007-07-10T12:08:00.000Z	numus	macogw	hmm
2007-08-17T09:34:00.000Z	macogw	numus	"linksys" doesnt matter.  chipset matters

2007-08-17T09:38:00.000Z	numus	macogw	the directory has a space in teh  name
2007-08-17T09:38:00.000Z	macogw	numus	1) dont do it as root 2) don't do it on /
2007-08-17T09:38:00.000Z	macogw	numus	so?
2007-08-17T09:38:00.000Z	macogw	numus	you can put the part with the space in quotes, or escape the space with a backslash
2007-08-17T09:38:00.000Z	numus	macogw	ok but how about my wireless card problem
2007-08-17T09:38:00.000Z	macogw	numus	example: rm -rf ~/my\ stuff/  OR rm -rf ~/"my stuff"/
