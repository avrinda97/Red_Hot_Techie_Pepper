2006-12-17T14:33:00.000Z	SilentDis	danniy	 an easy way to think about it is this:  typing sudo before a command basically makes it like that command will execute as root
2006-12-17T14:34:00.000Z	SilentDis	danniy	 and if you need a gui program to run as root (as example, running nautilus as root), you can gksudo <command>
2006-12-17T14:48:00.000Z	SilentDis	danniy	 are they ntfs partitions?
2006-12-17T14:49:00.000Z	SilentDis	danniy	 should be able to just mount it.  are you running IDE drives, or SATA drives?
2006-12-17T14:51:00.000Z	SilentDis	danniy	 you should be able to just mount it directly...
2006-12-17T14:51:00.000Z	SilentDis	danniy	 do you get an error when you try?
2006-12-17T14:52:00.000Z	SilentDis	danniy	 what did you type for your mount command?
2006-12-17T14:55:00.000Z	SilentDis	danniy	 i must've missed it, how did you try to mount the drive?
2006-12-17T14:56:00.000Z	SilentDis	danniy	 ahhh, you must mount the drive first, so you can have access to it.
2006-12-17T14:57:00.000Z	SilentDis	danniy	 no, you're not.  just uninformed.  HUGE difference.  the fact that you're asking here is evidence of that :)
2006-12-17T14:59:00.000Z	SilentDis	danniy	 if you have more questions, just ask.  if those don't help you... i'm sure someone here can walk you through editing /etc/fstab to do it automatically for you :)
