2006-07-15T09:44:00.000Z	wheelswitch		im trying to use crontab to schedual rhythmbox to open, but it isnt working
2006-07-15T09:44:00.000Z	wheelswitch		43 * * * * /usr/bin/rhythmbox is the command im using, also tried 43 * * * * rhythmbox but that doesnt seem to work either, this ofcourse is displayed when i type crontab -l
2006-07-15T09:45:00.000Z	wheelswitch		!crontab
2006-07-15T09:45:00.000Z	bbrazil	wheelswitch	that won't work, DISPLAY isn't set
2006-07-15T09:46:00.000Z	bbrazil	wheelswitch	what are you trying to do?
2006-07-15T09:46:00.000Z	wheelswitch	bbrazil	 set up an alarm clock
2006-07-15T09:46:00.000Z	bbrazil	wheelswitch	use mpg321, doesn't need X
2006-07-15T09:46:00.000Z	bbrazil	wheelswitch	assuming an mp3 file
2006-07-15T09:47:00.000Z	bbrazil	wheelswitch	there is, but it depends on a pile of other stuff - like you being logged in
2006-07-15T09:48:00.000Z	bbrazil	wheelswitch	you can try adding DISPLAY=:0 to start of the crontab
2006-07-15T09:49:00.000Z	bbrazil	wheelswitch	*:0.0
2006-07-15T09:50:00.000Z	bbrazil	wheelswitch	It's ":0.0", I'm not fully sure this'll work
2006-07-15T09:51:00.000Z	wheelswitch	bbrazil	 20 secs till we find out...
2006-07-15T09:52:00.000Z	wheelswitch	bbrazil	 genious, thanks heaps.
2006-07-15T09:52:00.000Z	bbrazil	wheelswitch	I don't think it's the right solution, but if it works...
2006-07-15T09:56:00.000Z	wheelswitch	bbrazil	 perhaps it isnt, the command i really want to use is rhythmbox --play, but that brings up "The Application "rhythmbox" has quit unexpectedly." however it doesnt actually quit :S
2006-07-15T09:57:00.000Z	bbrazil	wheelswitch	something commandline based should work
2006-07-15T09:58:00.000Z	wheelswitch	bbrazil	 if i make a shell script to do it would that work, then run the shell script with crontab?
2006-07-15T09:58:00.000Z	bbrazil	wheelswitch	should do
2006-07-15T09:58:00.000Z	bbrazil	wheelswitch	to test, run it as 'env -i script.sh'
2006-07-15T10:07:00.000Z	wheelswitch	bbrazil	 doesnt seem to like it :(. Oh well ill go with mpg321
