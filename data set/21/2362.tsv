2011-04-13T07:30:00.000Z	hylian	Nick_Meister	i had this problem, i had to first remove the offending package from /var/cache/apt/archives then i did an update.
2011-04-13T07:30:00.000Z	Nick_Meister	hylian	how do i find what to remove
2011-04-13T07:32:00.000Z	hylian	Nick_Meister	well, if you run synaptic, or do what KNUBBIG said, you should see an error message with your problem package
2011-04-13T07:35:00.000Z	Nick_Meister	hylian	ok so i removed the debs but it did not help anything :(
2011-04-13T07:36:00.000Z	Nick_Meister	hylian	well what happened was i added a repository with a newer package to the apt-get and then tried to do an install but forgetting to run update, and somehow the two packages got mixed
2011-04-13T07:37:00.000Z	hylian	Nick_Meister	now you will have to a) run sudo apt-get install -f, and then perhaps run a fix for dpkg, and then try and re-install whatever you where trying to install.
2011-04-13T07:37:00.000Z	Nick_Meister	hylian	well it doesnt work
2011-04-13T07:38:00.000Z	hylian	Nick_Meister	so what error does it give you? i have had to go as far as actually changing a log file...
2011-04-13T07:39:00.000Z	Nick_Meister	hylian	trying to overwrite '/usr/lib/OGRE/Plugin_OctreeSceneManager.so', which is also in package libogremain-1.6.4 0:1.6.4.dfsg1-1
2011-04-13T07:43:00.000Z	Nick_Meister	hylian	so any luck?
2011-04-13T07:43:00.000Z	hylian	Nick_Meister	"into /var/lib/dpkg/info and deleting everything that had that name and you may also have to go into /var/cache/apt/archives and do the same thing"
2011-04-13T07:44:00.000Z	hylian	Nick_Meister	oops, somehow i only copied part of that, did you getb the gist?
2011-04-13T07:44:00.000Z	Nick_Meister	hylian	yah it worked like a charm thanks
