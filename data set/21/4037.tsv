2009-04-05T08:02:00.000Z	Huufarted	space_cadet	if you ask me, that's pointless because a Win98 boot disk is 100% worthless.  Use a DSL image or something.  DSL = Damn Small Linux
2009-04-05T08:02:00.000Z	space_cadet	Huufarted	no it's not.
2009-04-05T08:03:00.000Z	Huufarted	space_cadet	what purpose would a 98 boot disk serve?  No NTFS support, no Ext2/3 support, etc.
2009-04-05T08:03:00.000Z	space_cadet	Huufarted	not needed.
2009-04-05T08:03:00.000Z	Huufarted	space_cadet	then you're asking in the wrong channel as this is the support channel for Ubuntu
2009-04-05T08:04:00.000Z	space_cadet	Huufarted	no
2009-04-05T08:04:00.000Z	Huufarted	space_cadet	yes
2009-04-05T08:04:00.000Z	space_cadet	Huufarted	if you were to read my question.
2009-04-05T08:04:00.000Z	space_cadet	Huufarted	you would understand the problem
2009-04-05T08:04:00.000Z	space_cadet	Huufarted	so please stop flaming me
2009-04-05T08:04:00.000Z	Huufarted	space_cadet	I understand the question.  You want to take a .ima/img floppy image and make it bootable on a USB device and that is off topic in relation to Ubuntu.
2009-04-05T08:05:00.000Z	space_cadet	Huufarted	really.
2009-04-05T08:05:00.000Z	space_cadet	Huufarted	because I thought i wanted to do this from within linux
2009-04-05T08:05:00.000Z	space_cadet	Huufarted	now that changes everything.
2009-04-05T08:05:00.000Z	space_cadet	Huufarted	so please, stop flaming
2009-04-05T08:05:00.000Z	Huufarted	space_cadet	changes nothing.  That is off topic.  Please ask that in #ubuntu-offtopic
2009-04-05T08:05:00.000Z	space_cadet	Huufarted	no it's not.
2009-04-05T08:06:00.000Z	space_cadet	Huufarted	the point is, it does not matter what I want to do with the disk... the point is I want to extract an IMA to a usb drive from within linux
2009-04-05T08:06:00.000Z	space_cadet	Huufarted	so please again, stop flaming
2009-04-05T08:06:00.000Z	Huufarted	space_cadet	That is not an #ubuntu question, just ask asking questions about Compiz and usage for it are off topic
2009-04-05T08:07:00.000Z	space_cadet	Huufarted	so asking how to extract an IMG file to a usb disk in ubuntu is not ubuntu related?
