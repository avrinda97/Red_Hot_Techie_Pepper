2008-12-11T03:56:00.000Z	Ketzu	gnutron	How would I do that without a gui?
2008-12-11T03:57:00.000Z	gnutron	Ketzu	whip open synaptic, its in the menu options somewhere, quite easy, check it out.
2008-12-11T03:58:00.000Z	Ketzu		gnutron; I don't have synaptic.
2008-12-11T03:58:00.000Z	gnutron	Ketzu	oh, ok, insure no '#' pound signs precede the repo's you desire in sources.list
2008-12-11T03:58:00.000Z	Ketzu	gnutron	Doesn't
2008-12-11T03:59:00.000Z	gnutron	Ketzu	does apt-get update work?
2008-12-11T04:01:00.000Z	Ketzu	gnutron	Yes. Results: http://pastebin.ca/1282073
2008-12-11T04:01:00.000Z	Ketzu	gnutron	It might be because I'm on a lts version
2008-12-11T04:02:00.000Z	gnutron	Ketzu	that looks ok, what do you want to do again?
2008-12-11T04:02:00.000Z	gnutron	Ketzu	browse stuff?
2008-12-11T04:02:00.000Z	Ketzu	gnutron	I'm trying to install passenger. rubygems are being a pain so I'm trying to install it through the aptitude
2008-12-11T04:02:00.000Z	gnutron	Ketzu	aptitude should work, use sudo of course
2008-12-11T04:03:00.000Z	Ketzu		The package I'm trying to install is libapache2-mod-passenger; I downlaoded the deb after running into the sources problem, and installed it, but then the .so file isn't being placed properly
2008-12-11T04:03:00.000Z	Ketzu	gnutron	I'm in a root environment
2008-12-11T04:05:00.000Z	gnutron	Ketzu	you need the development repo enabled, or deb src entry to get source files if i recall correctly.
2008-12-11T04:05:00.000Z	Ketzu	gnutron	shouldn't. It's a third-party repo. one sec
2008-12-11T04:06:00.000Z	Ketzu	gnutron	Upgrading to intreped fixed it
2008-12-11T04:06:00.000Z	gnutron	Ketzu	i noticed the third party repo, that could pose problems.
2008-12-11T04:06:00.000Z	Ketzu	gnutron	Software isn't in the regular hehe
2008-12-11T04:07:00.000Z	gnutron	Ketzu	i hope my upgrade to intrepid goes well, i havent found the nerve just yet.
2008-12-11T04:08:00.000Z	Ketzu	gnutron	This is on a slicehost, basically just an image extract haha
