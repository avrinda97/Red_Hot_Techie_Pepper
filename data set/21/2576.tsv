2010-05-14T21:48:00.000Z	pgpkeys		whats the gnome program name for taking a snapshot of your desktop? I want to submit an image of the desktop to image.ca so that I can show people what the desktop looks hoping folks know what package is responsible for the look so i can remove it
2010-05-14T21:49:00.000Z	pgpkeys		uhh how is it convoluted. if no one knows what the desktop looks like how can someone say Oh thats done buy such and such a package?
2010-05-14T21:50:00.000Z	pgpkeys		dr_willis ~ no, i want to remove the package that handles the desktop UI layout and look. the specific one that is making the desktop look like it is
2010-05-14T21:50:00.000Z	pgpkeys		anxiousnut ~ hehe you get that let me know cause it tels me the same thing with my fglrx module installed
2010-05-14T21:51:00.000Z	pgpkeys		dr_willis ~ yes, its not the normal desktop. I want to REVERT back to that, AND i want to revert the gdm theme back to its official default
2010-05-14T21:51:00.000Z	AnxiousNut	pgpkeys	:( will do if i got the answer
2010-05-14T21:51:00.000Z	pgpkeys	john__	~ will run that as soon as these updates finish installing
2010-05-14T21:52:00.000Z	pgpkeys		dr_willis ~ i thought it was avant-window-manager (installed to check it out at the time) but i have since purged that package and the awn* packages as well
2010-05-14T21:52:00.000Z	pgpkeys		so it should have reverted back
2010-05-14T21:52:00.000Z	pgpkeys		and no ubuntu-netbook isn't the problem. i know what THAT one looks like
2010-05-14T21:52:00.000Z	pgpkeys		this looks almost like a BeOS or something
2010-05-14T21:53:00.000Z	pgpkeys		gonna use the gnome-screenshot as soon as these packages finish installing
2010-05-14T21:53:00.000Z	pgpkeys		was doing an apt-get upgrade when i asked the question
2010-05-14T21:56:00.000Z	pgpkeys		hrmm might have to do that tomorrow. running out of battery power on the lappy and there's no plugs :)
2010-05-14T22:01:00.000Z	pgpkeys		whats the last part of this command? aptitude unmarkauto ??
2010-05-14T22:01:00.000Z	pgpkeys		trying to mark the apps that were automatically installed as manually installed without having to use the damn interface
2010-05-14T22:02:00.000Z	pgpkeys		i thought it was aptitude unmarkauto ~* but that would mark every single thing in the system wouldn't it?
2010-05-14T22:05:00.000Z	pgpkeys		hehe i was wrong. it's aptitude keep-all
2010-05-14T22:05:00.000Z	pgpkeys		duh
2010-05-14T22:15:00.000Z	AnxiousNut	pgpkeys	i think i might have solved it! not getting the error!
2010-05-14T22:15:00.000Z	AnxiousNut	pgpkeys	are you there?
