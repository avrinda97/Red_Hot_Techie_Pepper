2010-09-26T09:47:00.000Z	Sn0wman		This might be a stupid question but how is it "paid"
2010-09-26T09:48:00.000Z	Sn0wman		I can download the gstreamer codec and it plays mp3 fine. I didn'thave to pay antying
2010-09-26T09:48:00.000Z	Sn0wman		I like vlc
2010-09-26T09:48:00.000Z	Sn0wman		it's basic but supports freakin everything

2010-09-26T09:48:00.000Z	Sn0wman		mean*
2010-09-26T09:49:00.000Z	Sn0wman		? I just installed it via repos
2010-09-26T09:51:00.000Z	Sn0wman		oh yah. I guess it is the old version
2010-09-26T09:52:00.000Z	Sn0wman		lzinucs: how can it be illegal to use in some countries? how can you patent a codec?
2010-09-26T09:52:00.000Z	llutz	Sn0wman	the mpeg-consortium holds the rights on mp3. every dev using that in his software has to license/pay it
2010-09-26T09:53:00.000Z	llutz	Sn0wman	fortunately some don't ...
2010-09-26T09:54:00.000Z	llutz	Sn0wman	yes
2010-09-26T10:19:00.000Z	llutz	Sn0wman	have you tried a different mirror?
2010-09-26T10:22:00.000Z	llutz	Sn0wman	sounds like, i prefer to modify my sources.list
2010-09-26T10:23:00.000Z	Sn0wman	llutz	yah but how do you know what to change it to?
2010-09-26T10:24:00.000Z	Sn0wman	llutz	this is my sources.list http://pastebin.com/UkTE0mtr
2010-09-26T10:31:00.000Z	Sn0wman	llutz	so are not sure where to find the alternate mirrors?
2010-09-26T10:32:00.000Z	llutz	Sn0wman	look at the wiki, there should be a list. i don't have www here, cannot point you to one, sry
2010-09-26T10:33:00.000Z	Sn0wman	llutz	hey it's np. I was just wondering if you happened to know off the top of your head
2010-09-26T10:34:00.000Z	llutz	Sn0wman	i'm actually not even running ubuntu, so "no" again ;)
2010-09-26T10:34:00.000Z	Sn0wman	llutz	well thanks anyway :-)
