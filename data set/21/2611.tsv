2011-08-06T00:23:00.000Z	cmanns		Any suggestions for PXE boot?
2011-08-06T00:24:00.000Z	wols	cmanns	read the docs more careuflly and think more before you type and ask here, so you clearly and concisely lay out the problem
2011-08-06T00:30:00.000Z	cmanns	wols	you see I've been reading the doc's
2011-08-07T11:51:00.000Z	wols	cmanns	missing stage 1.5 and stage 2 files most likely. what dos "help" say?
2011-08-07T11:52:00.000Z	wols	cmanns	and are you getting the grub menu or an error?
2011-08-07T11:53:00.000Z	wols	cmanns	more explanation needed
2011-08-07T12:43:00.000Z	wols	cmanns	you sure the hardware is actually working? not a dead usb stick?
2011-08-07T12:44:00.000Z	wols	cmanns	kernel has nothing to do with automount or formatting
2011-08-07T12:44:00.000Z	cmanns	wols	I didn't say kernel, I said oddly formatted usb drives.
2011-08-07T12:45:00.000Z	wols	cmanns	and I said the kernel doesn't care about formatting
2011-08-07T12:46:00.000Z	wols	cmanns	"aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Noise.wav" or any other wav file
2011-08-07T12:49:00.000Z	cmanns	wols	huh?
2011-08-07T12:50:00.000Z	wols	cmanns	you and cypha start both with c. not enough letters typed for autocomplete. have you tried a reboot? maybe your kernel got confused by your switching around the usb devices? but that's a WAG
2011-08-07T12:53:00.000Z	wols	cmanns	does it work with the ubuntu live cd?
2011-08-07T12:53:00.000Z	cmanns	wols	what you mean?
2011-08-07T12:54:00.000Z	wols	cmanns	boot from the ubuntu live cd, plug it in. does the kernel recognize it in any way then?
2011-08-07T12:54:00.000Z	cmanns	wols	I'm the guy who came for days about PXE...
2011-08-07T12:54:00.000Z	wols	cmanns	or maybe can you plug it in and then paste dmesg | tail ?
2011-08-07T12:57:00.000Z	wols	cmanns	if it works everywhere else but never on this PC, then it's a hardware problem
2011-08-07T12:57:00.000Z	wols	cmanns	unless you can show us another linux distro running on this PC where it does work. only then it is a ubuntu kernel problem
2011-08-07T12:58:00.000Z	wols	cmanns	there are no magical "fix" things
