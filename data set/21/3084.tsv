2009-04-16T13:20:00.000Z	dandre		Hello,
2009-04-16T13:22:00.000Z	dandre		what sould be the best method to remotely access my ubuntu workstation 8.10?
2009-04-16T13:24:00.000Z	Hassanakevazir	dandre	what OS you use to access your workstation ?
2009-04-16T13:25:00.000Z	dandre	Hassanakevazir	ubuntu 8.10 both sides
2009-04-16T13:28:00.000Z	Hassanakevazir	dandre	easiest would be setting up system > Preferences > Remote desktop  on the remote workstation, then at the other one  Internet > remote Desktop Viewer
2009-04-16T13:30:00.000Z	dandre		ok but that way I must have an opened session on the remote workstation
2009-04-16T13:34:00.000Z	Hassanakevazir	dandre	then you could try : ssh -X username@ipadress <program name>
2009-04-16T13:34:00.000Z	Hassanakevazir	dandre	no idea how to login into graphical desktop remotely
2009-04-16T13:35:00.000Z	dandre	Hassanakevazir	I have a segmentation fault
2009-04-16T13:39:00.000Z	Hassanakevazir	dandre	can you do regular ssh? with no -X
2009-04-16T13:40:00.000Z	dandre	Hassanakevazir	I have a seg fault whan I am trying to use vinagre
2009-04-16T13:41:00.000Z	Hassanakevazir	dandre	what about other applications?
2009-04-16T13:41:00.000Z	dandre		all applications are fine except  vinagre
2009-04-16T13:45:00.000Z	Hassanakevazir	dandre	probably because vinagre needs an active session, look for a way to start a session on a remote desktop, maybe someone on forums knows
2009-04-16T13:47:00.000Z	dandre		I have an active session on the remote
2009-04-16T13:49:00.000Z	Hassanakevazir	dandre	huh , you said you didn't . well you could try installing vnc and configuring it on the remote desktop via ssh, then use vnc from local to login
2009-04-16T13:50:00.000Z	Hassanakevazir		!tab
2009-04-16T13:53:00.000Z	dandre		ok I can use rdesktop but not vinagre.
2009-04-16T13:54:00.000Z	Hassanakevazir		!ubottu
2009-04-16T13:55:00.000Z	Hassanakevazir		!stopgdm is sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
2009-04-16T13:57:00.000Z	dandre	Hassanakevazir	I have this error in syslog:
