2011-06-08T18:38:00.000Z	gohdan		hello gang, i have logged in locally via 'su -l foo' and am trying to have xeyes run in my X session as user 'foo'. when i execute xeyes the shell complains with the following: "No protocol specified Error: Can't open display: :0.0". i have 'export DISPLAY=:0.0' and even tried  'DISPLAY=:0.0 xeyes' to no avail. any help or tips would be most appreciated.
2011-06-08T18:38:00.000Z	celthunder	gohdan	make a terminal in the X session and start xeyes there as the user you want?
2011-06-08T18:39:00.000Z	gohdan	celthunder	right.
2011-06-09T09:01:00.000Z	celthunder	gohdan	xmonad/awesome are very similar depending on what you look for...
2011-06-09T09:01:00.000Z	celthunder	gohdan	i just listed the one i used first
2011-06-09T09:02:00.000Z	gohdan	celthunder	indeed. the beauty of free software. tons of choices.
2011-06-09T09:04:00.000Z	celthunder	gohdan	:) indeed
2011-06-09T10:08:00.000Z	gohdan	celthunder	please pick steve balmer :)
2011-06-15T08:48:00.000Z	celthunder	gohdan	is the transarency using the picture on the root xwindow? what layer did you put your wallpaper on
2011-06-15T08:48:00.000Z	celthunder	gohdan	try xloadimage --onroot <image> does the transparency still grab gdm's picture?
2011-06-15T08:55:00.000Z	celthunder	gohdan	openbox huh not bad...
2011-06-15T08:58:00.000Z	celthunder	gohdan	i said xloadimage --onroot <image>
2011-06-15T09:00:00.000Z	celthunder	gohdan	did that command work?
2011-06-15T09:02:00.000Z	celthunder	gohdan	did you run that xloadimage?
2011-06-15T09:03:00.000Z	gohdan	celthunder	complains about '--onroot'
2011-06-15T09:04:00.000Z	celthunder	gohdan	try just one - so xloadimage -onroot sory
2011-06-15T09:06:00.000Z	gohdan	celthunder	"Building XImage...done" still all weird but, lxsession is finicky sometimes so let me log in and out
2011-06-15T09:08:00.000Z	gohdan	celthunder	its a no go. still gdm.
2011-06-15T09:08:00.000Z	celthunder	gohdan	hmm ok what terminal app were you using again?
2011-06-15T09:09:00.000Z	gohdan	celthunder	gnome-terminal and the lxterminal that ships with lxde
