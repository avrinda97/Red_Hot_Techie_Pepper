2009-02-16T16:47:00.000Z	funkyHat		I'm getting a lot of failed connections to google today, is it just me? (doesn't seem to be happening with anyone else's site)
2009-02-16T16:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	funkyHat	try pinging google from terminal, see if you drop packets. Its fine here
2009-02-19T17:46:00.000Z	funkyHat	ActionParsnip	this isn't a keyboard issue(although I guess it's related)... somehow alt+button3 on my mouse is mapped to type 'Screenshot'
2009-02-19T17:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	funkyHat	you have set the shortcut somewhere in that configuration, be it keyboard or mouse
2009-02-19T17:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	funkyHat	sticky keyboard eh...have you had hansum over?
2009-02-19T17:49:00.000Z	funkyHat	ActionParsnip	not physically stuck, sometimes my modifier keys get somehow stuck the wrong way and I have to press them all a couple of times before I can type. Not sure why it is maybe I try to type too fast and get the order I hit them wrong
2009-02-19T17:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	funkyHat	you missed the joke ;)
2009-02-19T17:50:00.000Z	funkyHat	ActionParsnip	I didn't, I guess my sense of humor is cranky this early in the afternoon though :P
2009-11-04T19:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	funkyHat	can you run:    compiz --replace
2009-11-04T19:37:00.000Z	funkyHat	ActionParsnip	yes that's when it complains about the software rasteriser
2009-11-04T19:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	funkyHat	check video drivers
2009-11-04T19:38:00.000Z	funkyHat	ActionParsnip	syk: http://pastebin.com/d57fb9a19
2009-11-04T19:39:00.000Z	funkyHat	ActionParsnip	what do you mean by that?
2009-11-04T19:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	funkyHat	check video drivers are installed right
2009-11-04T19:39:00.000Z	funkyHat	ActionParsnip	I'm using the open source ati drivers
2009-11-04T19:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	funkyHat	you may want to consult /var/log/Xorg.log.0
2009-11-04T19:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	funkyHat	/var/log/Xorg.0.log    sorry
2009-11-04T19:46:00.000Z	funkyHat	ActionParsnip	I can't see any erros there http://pastebin.com/f6df306ec but perhaps I don't know what I'm looking for
2009-11-04T19:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	funkyHat	try a reboot
2009-11-04T19:55:00.000Z	funkyHat	ActionParsnip	that did it, somewhat annoyingly -.-
2009-11-04T19:55:00.000Z	funkyHat	ActionParsnip	thanks
