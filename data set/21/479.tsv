2011-11-21T14:54:00.000Z	brianpWins		hmmmm. I did addgroup user admin and it said it worked. but when I login as that user gem uninstall still give me write permission errors
2011-11-21T14:55:00.000Z	brianpWins		You don't have write permissions into the /usr/local/rbenv/versions/1.9.2-p290/bin directory.
2011-11-21T14:56:00.000Z	joshmc	brianpWins	is this an rvm setup?
2011-11-21T14:56:00.000Z	brianpWins	joshmc	not rvm. rbenv
2011-11-21T15:00:00.000Z	joshmc	brianpWins	I'm not familiar with it. I know that with rvm there was a specific way you had to invoke gem, rvmsudo, if you installed it system-wide (i.e. /usr/local ), and the initial documentation of rbenv rings very similar to rvm (to my ears)
2011-11-21T15:01:00.000Z	brianpWins	joshmc	yeah rbenv and rvm are solving the same issues so I'll look into that a bit more. Although with root. i can bundle install with success
2011-11-21T15:02:00.000Z	joshmc	brianpWins	gem install with root? and `which gem` turns up a version-specific gem ?
2011-11-21T15:03:00.000Z	brianpWins	joshmc	which gem gives me /usr/local/rbenv/shims/gem and when logged in with root gem install works fine
2011-11-21T15:06:00.000Z	joshmc	brianpWins	are there ruby/gem binaries in version/<vers>/bin ?? even symlinks or something (again, going off of rvm-based knowledge)
2011-11-21T15:06:00.000Z	brianpWins	joshmc	i believe so. the shim should point towards: /usr/local/rbenv/versions/1.9.2-p290/bin
2011-11-21T15:08:00.000Z	brianpWins	joshmc	could it be because I installed rbenv while logged in as root ? and all the directories for rbenv are assigned to root or something?
2011-11-21T15:09:00.000Z	joshmc	brianpWins	I had suspected that you had a good reason to install it as root, but if the only reason was because that's how you would normally install software, then probably thats the problem :)
2011-11-21T15:10:00.000Z	brianpWins	joshmc	ahhhh is there a nicer fix for that other then blowing out the directory and re-installing with a normal user?
2011-11-21T15:10:00.000Z	joshmc	brianpWins	probably not
2011-11-21T15:10:00.000Z	brianpWins	joshmc	okay. blow out the dir it is
2011-11-21T15:10:00.000Z	joshmc	brianpWins	but see if there's an uninstall function first
2011-11-21T15:11:00.000Z	brianpWins	joshmc	should I also be concerned about everything else i've installed? nginx many libs with aptitude
2011-11-21T15:12:00.000Z	joshmc	brianpWins	if you installed nginx with support for passenger you'll have to reconfigure it, but nginx is pretty easy to build/rebuild iirc
2011-11-21T15:13:00.000Z	joshmc	brianpWins	mixing aptitude installed rubies and gem installed rubies, especially in a versioned ruby system is a bad idea
2011-11-21T15:13:00.000Z	brianpWins	joshmc	oh totally. I didn't install ruby via anything but rbenv. just other compiler libs and mysql etc
2011-11-21T15:14:00.000Z	joshmc	brianpWins	should be smooth(-er) sailings then
