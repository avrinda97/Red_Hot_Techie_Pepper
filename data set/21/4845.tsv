2008-01-31T03:54:00.000Z	bkb		Grimer-> boot into safe mode, and modify the /etc/init.d/   where it points to your cupsd
2008-01-31T03:55:00.000Z	bkb		Jordan_U-> i thought so to, I was just pointing it out to another user
2008-01-31T03:56:00.000Z	bkb		riba1-> oh yeah i can sort of recall, for latest maybe you need python 1.5 so you may need to upgrade
2008-01-31T03:57:00.000Z	bkb		Stepa2-> you need to add -t iso9660  as an option to mount
2008-01-31T03:58:00.000Z	bkb		Stepa2-> you need to specify the file system type you are mounting unless it is ext2/ext3
2008-01-31T03:58:00.000Z	bkb		or reiserfs
2008-01-31T03:59:00.000Z	bkb		nemilar-> it would not recognize ramfs or squashfs or tmpfs  per my experience
2008-01-31T03:59:00.000Z	bkb		Stepa2-> options are the ones that start with -   so in the middle
2008-01-31T04:00:00.000Z	bkb		tigran->  which ubuntu version?
2008-01-31T04:00:00.000Z	tigran	bkb	Gutsy
2008-01-31T04:01:00.000Z	bkb		tigran-> you downloaded the tar.gz file?
2008-01-31T04:01:00.000Z	tigran	bkb	No, from firefox, installing missing plugins
2008-01-31T04:01:00.000Z	bkb		tigran->  okay , if you like to try, to what i did, download the tar.gz from adobe site
2008-01-31T04:02:00.000Z	bkb		Stepa2-> you have to tell us the whole scenario, we will give you wrong advise if you we assume different
2008-01-31T04:02:00.000Z	tigran	bkb	Then run the installer?
2008-01-31T04:02:00.000Z	bkb	tigran	nope, untar it and put the .so into ...
2008-01-31T04:03:00.000Z	bkb		tigran-> put into /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins,   you also have to create  a ~/.mozilla/plugins/   and put a copy there too;  kill firefox and restart it
2008-01-31T04:06:00.000Z	tigran	bkb	Thanks
