2005-01-01T11:30:00.000Z	Dko		Could someone help me with my  TinyFugue install problem?
2005-01-01T11:31:00.000Z	Blackwell	Dko	hm. is that software in any way related to the "brainf*ck" programming language?
2005-01-01T11:32:00.000Z	Dko	Blackwell	If you being serious. I have no clue.
2005-01-01T11:32:00.000Z	Blackwell	Dko	half serious. that language actually exists. :)
2005-01-02T07:53:00.000Z	Blackwell	Dko	do you need to install it inside the package system? if not, to go without is much simpler as far as i know.
2005-01-02T08:30:00.000Z	Blackwell	Dko	it should not be set. CLASSPATH env var should never be set.
2005-01-02T08:31:00.000Z	Blackwell	Dko	i don't understand what you mean. who is it?
2005-01-02T08:32:00.000Z	Dko	Blackwell	Look under compiling JamochaMUD.  Thats what im trying to do
2005-01-02T08:32:00.000Z	Blackwell	Dko	is that project still alive?
2005-01-02T08:33:00.000Z	Blackwell	Dko	why do you try to compile it yourself?
2005-01-02T08:34:00.000Z	Dko	Blackwell	Because it seamed the only way to get it runing on ubuntu by what his instructions said
2005-01-02T08:34:00.000Z	Blackwell	Dko	where does it say that?
2005-01-02T08:35:00.000Z	Blackwell	Dko	wether you compile the stuff and stick it into a jar file after 10 hours of solid work, or just use their .jar file, that should not make a relevant difference, apart from time spent on it.
2005-01-02T08:36:00.000Z	Dko	Blackwell	See I have no clue when it comes to linux or Java.  C++ I have some sorta clue but... :p
2005-01-02T08:37:00.000Z	Blackwell	Dko	http://jamochamud.anecho.mb.ca/jar/?M=D
2005-01-02T08:38:00.000Z	Blackwell	Dko	yeah. java requires oop. c++ invites self delusion about your own oop kung-fu (namely that c++ people plain don't have any, typically ;))
2005-01-02T08:40:00.000Z	Blackwell	Dko	double clicking a jar file may not have much success. the success directly depends what activity and programs has been associated with .jar files :)
2005-01-02T08:42:00.000Z	Blackwell	Dko	"java -jar theexecutablejarfile.jar" is not so mind numbing. but it assumes an "executable" jar.
2005-01-02T08:43:00.000Z	Blackwell	Dko	see "Jar files" at http://jamochamud.anecho.mb.ca/onlineReadme.html#CompilingJamochaMUD
2005-01-02T08:43:00.000Z	Blackwell	Dko	"... execute a command similar to: java -jar [name of jar file] .jar"
2005-01-02T08:44:00.000Z	Blackwell	Dko	the project seems alive. consider to contact them, without feedback "those" types of...misalligned java developers will never learn.
