2006-12-25T07:33:00.000Z	b0red		hi. what iso file do i need to download for intel core2 duo which is 64bits and not AMD64iso?
2006-12-25T07:34:00.000Z	b0red		hi. what iso file do i need to download for intel core2 duo which is 64bits and not AMD64iso?
2006-12-25T07:36:00.000Z	kitche	b0red	the amd64 is the only instalelr for x86_64 machines
2006-12-25T07:37:00.000Z	b0red	kitche	but why does it say for AMD64? i have intel core2 duo which is 64bits too!
2006-12-25T07:37:00.000Z	kitche	b0red	because amd came out with x86_64 first it's just a generic term
2006-12-25T07:45:00.000Z	kitche	b0red	you want x86_64 then get the amd64.iso but there is a lot of problems with x86_64 in Linux right now software wise
2006-12-25T07:46:00.000Z	kitche	b0red	do you watch Youtube alot?
2006-12-25T07:48:00.000Z	kitche	b0red	you will have to have a multilib system which can be a pain
2006-12-25T07:48:00.000Z	b0red	kitche	ok so i install 32bit ubuntu and not 64? tis better?
2006-12-25T07:49:00.000Z	kitche	b0red	yes right now it is since x86_64 doesn't really have a lot of software anyways
2006-12-25T07:49:00.000Z	b0red	kitche	so same talk applies for AMD..
2006-12-25T07:50:00.000Z	kitche	b0red	people tend to like i386 anyways right now in Linux
2006-12-25T07:54:00.000Z	b0red	kitche	im disappointed about ubuntu and 64bits
2006-12-25T07:54:00.000Z	b0red	kitche	seems a lack of 64bits support
2006-12-25T07:54:00.000Z	kitche	b0red	it's like that even for windows
2006-12-25T07:54:00.000Z	kitche	b0red	Windows doesn't even have true x86_64 bit support
2006-12-25T07:55:00.000Z	b0red	kitche	windows vista will have it no
2006-12-25T07:55:00.000Z	kitche	b0red	the kernel will be x86_64 but the software probably won't be
2006-12-25T07:56:00.000Z	b0red	kitche	but you can always run 32bits app on 64bit cpu.. it's just an advantage you have this additional 64bits support option... so i dont see any problems..
2006-12-25T07:57:00.000Z	kitche	b0red	yes but with Linux you have to install x86 libs to make the x86 programs to run which will make your system double in size
