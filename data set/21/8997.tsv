2005-11-29T14:35:00.000Z	gnome_away	soundray	 yes default 0
2005-11-29T14:33:00.000Z	soundray	gnome_away	is the new kernel in the first section starting with 'title'?
2005-11-29T14:34:00.000Z	soundray	gnome_away	and do you have a line 'default 0' near the top?
2005-11-29T14:34:00.000Z	gnome_away	soundray	right under "end default options"
2005-11-29T14:37:00.000Z	soundray	gnome_away	is the hiddenmenu line commented?
2005-11-29T14:37:00.000Z	soundray	gnome_away	when you boot and see the grub menu, is the first entry highlighted?
2005-11-29T14:40:00.000Z	soundray	gnome_away	if you leave it to update-grub to manage your boot menu, it should automatically boot the most recent kernel.
2005-11-29T14:40:00.000Z	soundray	gnome_away	sarge or breezy or whatever.
2005-11-29T14:40:00.000Z	soundray	gnome_away	enter 'update-grub'
2005-11-29T14:41:00.000Z	soundray	gnome_away	but it runs automatically when you install one of the linux-image-2.* kernels.
2005-11-29T14:41:00.000Z	soundray	gnome_away	sorry, sudo update-grub
2005-11-29T14:43:00.000Z	soundray	gnome_away	man grub-reboot
2005-11-29T14:46:00.000Z	soundray	gnome_away	'grep ^title /boot/grub/menu.lst | nl'
2005-11-29T14:46:00.000Z	soundray	gnome_away	subtract 1
2005-11-29T14:47:00.000Z	gnome_away	soundray	 so take 0 out and add a -1 to it?
2005-11-29T14:47:00.000Z	soundray	gnome_away	no, the command just tells you which is which, except that it is off by one.
2005-11-29T14:48:00.000Z	soundray	gnome_away	'grep ^title /boot/grub/menu.lst | nl -v0'
2005-11-29T14:49:00.000Z	soundray	gnome_away	what are you running right now?
2005-11-29T14:51:00.000Z	soundray	gnome_away	if you've got multiple Linux installations, maybe you should have each one install its own bootloader in the root or boot partition.
2005-11-29T14:51:00.000Z	soundray	gnome_away	then you can have one master bootloader that just chainloads the distribution you want.
2005-11-29T14:53:00.000Z	soundray	gnome_away	HTH. Gotta go.
