2006-02-20T06:18:00.000Z	christopher		i even took a c++ programming class to help me get into it

2006-02-20T06:21:00.000Z	christopher		i went thru ubuntu documentation and wiki
2006-02-20T06:21:00.000Z	christopher		and i still cant get realplayer10GOLD.bin to install
2006-02-20T06:21:00.000Z	_jason	christopher	I'd suggest not even bothering with it and just using mplayer with w32codecs
2006-02-20T06:22:00.000Z	_jason	christopher	that's why we come here
2006-02-20T06:26:00.000Z	_jason	christopher	you should let the package manager do all that for you, all you do is ask it to install X
2006-02-20T06:27:00.000Z	_jason	christopher	that would be pretty difficult, for example beer is not in there afaik, maybe in a secret repo somewhere
2006-02-20T06:28:00.000Z	_jason	christopher	apt-cache search gdesklets
2006-02-20T06:31:00.000Z	_jason	christopher	huh?
2006-02-20T06:36:00.000Z	_jason	christopher	ah I have the perfect thing for you to read.  Someone told me about it the other day and I wish I had seen it when I started.  i'll have the bot send you a link
2006-02-20T06:39:00.000Z	_jason	christopher	what irc client are you using now?
2006-02-20T06:41:00.000Z	_jason	christopher	one is probably from 'ubotu' with some links people told him to send you
2006-02-20T07:08:00.000Z	_jason	christopher	umm thanks I guess
2006-02-20T08:03:00.000Z	_jason	christopher	chr<tab>
