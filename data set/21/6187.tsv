2007-08-09T08:49:00.000Z	inqui	neverblue	 the newest version is said to be fixed some bugs i have
2007-08-09T08:49:00.000Z	neverblue	inqui	the .debs arent the 'latest' release of packages, but you could check the 'SoS' repos for a more upto date release (.deb) to install, else you can compile from source
2007-08-09T08:50:00.000Z	neverblue	inqui	there is a wine channel on freenode, please visit them at #winehq
2007-08-09T08:50:00.000Z	inqui	neverblue	 do i have to remove wine first ?
2007-08-09T08:50:00.000Z	inqui	neverblue	 i tried wine ... it sucked
