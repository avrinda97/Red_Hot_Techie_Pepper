2006-06-28T07:43:00.000Z	schmakk		hello.. if i have installed a way old ubuntu from a cd from.. 2004 i think, and want to upgrade to the latest, am i screwed?
2006-06-28T07:44:00.000Z	jrib	schmakk	what does 'lsb_release -c' say?  You aren't screwed, you just have to do a few upgrades
2006-06-28T07:44:00.000Z	schmakk	jrib	i think that will be a problem, since i have a problem with locales atm, and for some reason lsb is invovled
2006-06-28T07:45:00.000Z	jrib	schmakk	yes, it's probably best to resolve that first.  Maybe you can put your errors on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ and give everyone here a link to see if anyone can help
2006-06-28T07:46:00.000Z	schmakk	jrib	ok, gimme a few mins then :)

2006-06-28T07:57:00.000Z	jrib	schmakk	I'm not sure what causes that error, try searching for it on the forums
2006-06-28T07:58:00.000Z	schmakk	jrib	i tried and found a few pointers, but nothing has worked so far. Tried google and found more stuff there, still no go :/
2006-06-28T08:59:00.000Z	schmakk	jrib	if you are still there, could you give me a hand with the upgrading now? it seems as if i resolved my locales problems
2006-06-28T09:02:00.000Z	jrib	schmakk	sure, what step are you on now?
2006-06-28T09:03:00.000Z	schmakk	jrib	step 0 i assume, i installed from an old cd from 2004 and have updated whatever packages there was to update
2006-06-28T09:04:00.000Z	jrib	schmakk	ok, first let's find out the current release you have.  What does 'lsb_release -c' return in a terminal?
2006-06-28T09:05:00.000Z	jrib	schmakk	ok the safest thing to do is jump release to release.  If this is a fresh install, are you sure you don't just want to download the dapper .iso?
2006-06-28T09:05:00.000Z	schmakk	jrib	im on this box because my normal one died a horrible death and im kinda out of a burner
2006-06-28T09:06:00.000Z	jrib	schmakk	alright, here is the first link for upgrading to hoary.  You are going to go warty -> hoary -> breezy -> dapper.  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HoaryUpgradeNotes , ubotu will send you the links for breezy and dapper
2006-06-28T09:07:00.000Z	jrib	schmakk	the procedure will be basically the same for all three except you will change the name in the sources.list, you also have the option of using the gui for dapper
2006-06-28T09:08:00.000Z	schmakk	jrib	if theres a guide on how to do each release, could you link me those? i'd be well on my way from there

2006-06-30T16:23:00.000Z	schmakk	jrib	thanks for the help the other day, im now on a shiny 6.06 ubuntu, without problems
2006-06-30T16:23:00.000Z	jrib	schmakk	great
