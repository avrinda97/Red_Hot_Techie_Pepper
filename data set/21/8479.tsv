2006-06-10T08:04:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Matthewv	if you're running unauthenticated code as superuser, well, you get what you ask for - that's what pgp & package signing is for
2006-06-10T08:05:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Matthewv	do easyubuntu publish the md5 for the code?
2006-06-10T08:05:00.000Z	Matthewv	Frogzoo	thanks, but maybe kbrooks will find that more useful
2006-06-10T08:12:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Matthewv	disks can die within 3 weeks of purchase - should be a warranty job, so no problem
2006-06-10T08:12:00.000Z	Matthewv	Frogzoo	oh help :(
2006-06-10T08:12:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Matthewv	you should review /var/log/messages & look for hdd timeouts
2006-06-10T08:20:00.000Z	Matthewv	Frogzoo	would it help if I pastbin'd the content of /var/log/messages
2006-06-10T08:20:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Matthewv	I can take a quick look
2006-06-10T08:58:00.000Z	Matthewv	Frogzoo	did you end up having a look at my /var/log/messages ??
2006-06-10T08:59:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Matthewv	pastebin url?
2006-06-10T08:59:00.000Z	Matthewv	Frogzoo	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/15471
2006-06-10T09:02:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Matthewv	well that's only about 5 minutes of logs - but nothing wrong from just a quick look
2006-06-10T09:02:00.000Z	Matthewv	Frogzoo	it actually goes up to june 9th at the top doesn't it?
2006-06-13T15:25:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Matthewv	new hard drive?
2006-06-13T15:26:00.000Z	Matthewv	Frogzoo	less that a year... probably about 10 months
2006-06-13T15:26:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Matthewv	no, I mean that's maybe an option - a new hard drive
2006-06-13T15:27:00.000Z	Matthewv	Frogzoo	what i mean is that now some apps, most notably apt-get, are partly broken, so i can fix it, but its probably going to happen again :( i could reinstall, but that probably wont help in the long run, so you reckon go for a new hard drive?
2006-06-13T15:28:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Matthewv	you get foobared file systems for 2 reasons - either power failure, or disk going bad (and in extremely rare cases, driver bugs, but this is a very minor possibility)
2006-06-13T15:29:00.000Z	Matthewv	Frogzoo	is there any possibility of getting fsck to mark bad blocks or something like that, and keep going for a while... and is there a way to do a low level hdd check?
2006-06-13T15:29:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Matthewv	backup your data, & dl your hd manufacturers disk diagnosis s/w - see if the disk tests ok on r/w (ie data destructive tests) - then either replace the disk or reinstall
2006-06-13T15:30:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Matthewv	k, gl
