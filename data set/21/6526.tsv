2007-03-29T16:45:00.000Z	Slart	Mirth	there's not easy replacement for dvdshrink yet though
2007-03-29T16:45:00.000Z	Slart	Mirth	but ripping to xvid or divx etc works fine
2007-03-29T16:59:00.000Z	Slart	Mirth	yes.. as far as I can tell.. I'm still here =)
2007-03-29T05:00:00.000Z	Slart	Mirth	isn't that what the "filename" box is for?

2007-03-29T05:02:00.000Z	Slart	Mirth	you mean like a temporary folder?
2007-03-29T05:03:00.000Z	Mirth	Slart	Oh, I meant start ripping the dvd at like, "0:30:50" to "1:13.00", for example
2007-03-29T05:04:00.000Z	Slart	Mirth	aahh.. now I understand.. I think you can only rip scenes/chapters.. but you can always rip it all and cut it down with avidemux afterwardds
2007-03-29T05:57:00.000Z	Slart	Mirth	check /boot/grub/menu.lst
2007-03-29T05:58:00.000Z	Slart	Mirth	hmm.. don't think so
