2006-12-23T10:24:00.000Z	_Spire_	nosh	I do, just a second :)
2006-12-23T10:25:00.000Z	_Spire_	nosh	ok, go to system > preferences > screen resolution
2006-12-23T10:26:00.000Z	_Spire_	nosh	screen resolution doesn't list 1024x768?
2006-12-23T10:26:00.000Z	_Spire_	nosh	can you pastebin your xorg.conf?
2006-12-23T10:26:00.000Z	_Spire_	nosh	nope
2006-12-23T10:27:00.000Z	_Spire_	nosh	go to pastebin.com, or PM me
2006-12-23T10:28:00.000Z	_Spire_	nosh	ok
2006-12-23T10:30:00.000Z	_Spire_	nosh	what's the link?
2006-12-23T10:32:00.000Z	_Spire_	nosh	I don't see anything wrong with that...
2006-12-23T10:34:00.000Z	_Spire_	nosh	possibly
2006-12-23T10:35:00.000Z	_Spire_	nosh	try this: go to a terminal and type "sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf" and then hit Ctrl-W and then Ctrl-T
2006-12-23T10:35:00.000Z	_Spire_	nosh	type 142 and hit enter
2006-12-23T10:36:00.000Z	_Spire_	nosh	then delete anything on that line after 1024x768
2006-12-23T10:39:00.000Z	_Spire_	nosh	hit Ctrl-X then Y
2006-12-23T10:40:00.000Z	_Spire_	nosh	then restart
2006-12-23T10:48:00.000Z	_Spire_	nosh	don't know what to do now :(
