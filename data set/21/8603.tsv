2006-03-22T12:59:00.000Z	turix		look i can't run apt-get because everytime i try it prints "You might want to run `apt-get -f install' to correct these:
2006-03-22T13:00:00.000Z	turix		The following packages have unmet dependencies:"
2006-03-22T13:00:00.000Z	chuckyp	turix	did you try running sudo apt-get -f install then?
2006-03-22T13:01:00.000Z	turix	chuckyp	but i dont want to install those packages
2006-03-22T13:02:00.000Z	chuckyp	turix	well you need to fix the errors first
2006-03-22T13:02:00.000Z	turix	chuckyp	what errors?
2006-03-22T13:08:00.000Z	turix	chuckyp	it says its going to install the linux-image-2.6.12-9-k7 but my current version is 2.6.12-10-386
2006-03-22T13:09:00.000Z	chuckyp	turix	I dunno you have some broken dependency somewhere I'm sure there is  away to ignore the error though but I wouldn't.
2006-03-22T13:10:00.000Z	turix	chuckyp	 so you suggest that i run the apt-get -f install afterall?
2006-03-22T13:10:00.000Z	chuckyp	turix	what are you ultimately trying to do?  Just install something?
2006-03-22T13:10:00.000Z	turix	chuckyp	yup
2006-03-22T13:10:00.000Z	chuckyp	turix	and the problem is you can't because of that message?
2006-03-22T13:11:00.000Z	chuckyp	turix	what are you trying to install that it wants to do that?
2006-03-22T13:11:00.000Z	chuckyp	turix	right
2006-03-22T13:12:00.000Z	chuckyp	turix	what package are you trying to install?
2006-03-22T13:12:00.000Z	turix	chuckyp	i tried to install cl-jpeg earlier
2006-03-22T13:13:00.000Z	turix	chuckyp	is there someway to sortof regret it? :P
2006-03-22T13:13:00.000Z	chuckyp	turix	okay well what I would do is backup my /boot/grub/menu.1st then do the -f install that way you still remember the old kernel name.
2006-03-22T13:13:00.000Z	chuckyp	turix	regardless of what it wants to install it should still boot to the newest kernel.
2006-03-22T13:14:00.000Z	turix	chuckyp	yeah you're right, feels kinda risky though
2006-03-22T13:14:00.000Z	chuckyp	turix	not really it should still boot the newer kernel and it will make apt happy so you can use it again.  Or you can remove the package that is giving your grief if you don't need it.
