2008-08-01T05:37:00.000Z	eitreach		there's something completely wrong with Nautilus. I caught it using 1gb of ram. Is this a bug?
2008-08-01T05:38:00.000Z	Blaqlight	eitreach	using search function or just sitting there?
2008-08-01T05:39:00.000Z	eitreach	Blaqlight	just sitting there doing nothing. I had a wm-window open, but that's it.
2008-08-01T05:40:00.000Z	Blaqlight	eitreach	did you check ps ax for other things that may be running?
2008-08-01T05:40:00.000Z	eitreach	Blaqlight	I've caught it hanging several times today too, for no apparent reason.
2008-08-01T05:40:00.000Z	eitreach	Blaqlight	ps ax?
2008-08-01T05:42:00.000Z	eitreach	Blaqlight	what should I look for? I had to restart nautilus before, because it made my system practically stand still.
2008-08-01T05:46:00.000Z	eitreach	Blaqlight	I don't know what to look for.
2008-08-01T05:47:00.000Z	Blaqlight	eitreach	in a terminal type 'top' and check the top of the list.
2008-08-01T05:48:00.000Z	eitreach	Blaqlight	  357 eitreach  20   0 50496  33m  13m R   42  1.1 186:49.69 python
2008-08-01T05:49:00.000Z	Blaqlight	eitreach	right now python is using the most CPU and memory
2008-08-01T05:49:00.000Z	eitreach	Blaqlight	yes.. I was just wondering if there was a known problem with Nautilus, seeing it used so much ram.
2008-08-01T05:50:00.000Z	Blaqlight	eitreach	not sure, are all of you gnome updates installed?
2008-08-01T05:50:00.000Z	eitreach	Blaqlight	yes.
2008-08-01T05:50:00.000Z	eitreach	Blaqlight	yes.
2008-08-01T05:51:00.000Z	Blaqlight	eitreach	you have the 'proposed' branch enabled?
2008-08-01T05:51:00.000Z	eitreach	Blaqlight	yes..
2008-08-01T05:52:00.000Z	Blaqlight	eitreach	just a friendly suggestion, disable that, its can't ever be a good thing unless your actually debugging those programs.
2008-08-01T05:52:00.000Z	eitreach	Blaqlight	alright.
2008-08-01T05:53:00.000Z	Blaqlight	eitreach	you probably installed a proposed update that isn't fully implemented yet.
2008-08-09T13:09:00.000Z	Blaqlight	eitreach	I know folks that are all in your face, and they only market well when they get in your face, you buy 9/10 times.
