2008-06-12T20:38:00.000Z	Standalf		thx
2008-06-12T20:38:00.000Z	Standalf		has anybody some experiences with tremulous server?
2008-06-12T20:38:00.000Z	scunizi	Standalf	unless you're trying to do it in a directory blow you /home directory..
2008-06-12T20:39:00.000Z	Standalf		I want to make directory in usr/local/games - but I can do it only like root
2008-06-12T20:40:00.000Z	scunizi	Standalf	don't put it there.. just put it in your /home  directory..
2008-06-12T20:41:00.000Z	Standalf		I have to create folder there, Im creating tremulous server
2008-06-12T20:42:00.000Z	scunizi	Standalf	if you have to make a directory there then use sudo before the other line.
2008-06-12T20:42:00.000Z	Standalf	scunizi	so sudo mkdir name?
2008-06-12T20:42:00.000Z	scunizi	Standalf	yes
2008-06-12T20:42:00.000Z	Standalf		thx
2008-06-12T20:43:00.000Z	scunizi	Standalf	using sudo makes you root.. you can do damage if you're not careful
2008-06-12T20:44:00.000Z	Standalf	scunizi	ok
2008-06-12T20:44:00.000Z	Standalf		done
2008-06-12T20:47:00.000Z	Standalf		and how can I copy folder? cpdir? :D
2008-06-12T20:48:00.000Z	scunizi	Standalf	you want to copy or move.. copy is cp -r <foldername>  .. moving is mv -r <foldername>  .. use sudo where. needed
2008-06-12T20:48:00.000Z	Standalf		I would copy folder normally in gnome commander, because I dunno how to log as root there
2008-06-12T20:49:00.000Z	scunizi	Standalf	gksudo nautilus for a graphical root filemanager.. very dangerous.
2008-06-12T20:49:00.000Z	Standalf	scunizi	but it still doesnt say where to copy... do you mean cp -r folde1 folder2?
2008-06-12T20:50:00.000Z	scunizi	Standalf	yes.. cp -r <folder location>/foldername <newfolderlocation>/
