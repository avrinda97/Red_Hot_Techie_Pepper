2010-10-31T11:54:00.000Z	rigved		empathy on ubuntu allows to connect to IRC. why does empathy on debian lenny not have this option?
2010-10-31T11:54:00.000Z	AbhiJit	rigved	#debian
2010-10-25T18:02:00.000Z	AbhiJit	rigved	welcome
2010-10-31T11:55:00.000Z	rigved	AbhiJit	i have asked on #debian. Still no reply
2010-10-31T11:55:00.000Z	rigved	AbhiJit	i have ubuntu 10.04 on my desktop and debian lenny on my laptop
2010-10-31T11:55:00.000Z	AbhiJit	rigved	this channel is for ubuntu only
2010-10-31T11:55:00.000Z	AbhiJit	rigved	try their forums mailing list etc.
2010-10-31T11:57:00.000Z	rigved	AbhiJit	i will try that
2010-11-02T07:47:00.000Z	rigved	AbhiJit	that may not be the case, something else might be causing the problem. check system monitor for which applications are using the maximum amount of resources
2010-11-02T07:48:00.000Z	AbhiJit	rigved	ActionParsnip it started to happen after installatin of eclipse
2010-11-02T07:49:00.000Z	rigved	AbhiJit	start eclipse and then check system monitor. is eclipse using too much resources?
2010-11-02T07:49:00.000Z	AbhiJit	rigved	dunno
2010-11-02T07:53:00.000Z	rigved	AbhiJit	if you feel that eclipse is using too much resources and you want to remove it, then you can install netbeans as an alternative
2010-11-02T07:53:00.000Z	AbhiJit	rigved	ok
2010-11-02T08:10:00.000Z	AbhiJit	rigved	maco ok
2010-11-04T19:44:00.000Z	rigved	AbhiJit	i think 0755 would be more appropriate
2010-11-04T19:44:00.000Z	AbhiJit	rigved	hmm
2010-11-04T20:05:00.000Z	rigved	AbhiJit	happens with mine too sometimes (maybe DE causes it). yes check logs
2010-11-04T20:05:00.000Z	AbhiJit	rigved	sometimes != always
2010-12-23T21:19:00.000Z	rigved	AbhiJit	ok. but i need togo in like a few minutes
