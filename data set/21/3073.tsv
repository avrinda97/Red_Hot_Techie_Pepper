2009-05-28T14:32:00.000Z	DanDan		hello all .. I need help .. I recently upgraded to Jaunty im a 64amd user .. but I have a broken package and I keep getting an error rgarding flashplugin-non free please check this output http://pastebin.com/d193fdc3a
2009-05-28T14:33:00.000Z	h4mx0r	DanDan	can you open synaptic and choose fix broken packages from the menu then apply
2009-05-28T14:34:00.000Z	h4mx0r	DanDan	its no biggy really you probably quit halfway through the install
2009-05-28T14:34:00.000Z	DanDan	h4mx0r	: I did !! .. and it doesnt fix it :(
2009-05-28T14:34:00.000Z	DanDan	h4mx0r	: flashpluging-non free is broken and the flashplugin-installer is not installed
2009-05-28T14:35:00.000Z	h4mx0r	DanDan	does synaptic say its installed if so right click and choose full removal if not install it then do full removal
2009-05-28T14:36:00.000Z	DanDan	h4mx0r	: I did try that too .. I cant even remove it :(
2009-05-28T14:36:00.000Z	DanDan	h4mx0r	:Package is in a very bad inconsistent state - you should  reinstall it before attempting a removal.
2009-05-28T14:39:00.000Z	DanDan	h4mx0r	: ok aside from this problem .. after the upgrade i dont have a wireless connection manager ( I used to use wicd ) but i cant even install it from synaptic :S
2009-05-28T14:39:00.000Z	h4mx0r	DanDan	what you need to do is sudo dpkg --reconfigure -a I think if your having broken stuff
2009-05-28T14:39:00.000Z	h4mx0r	DanDan	enable the repositories you use, some might be out of date and don't do 9.04
2009-05-28T14:40:00.000Z	DanDan	h4mx0r	: ok what other wireless network managers I can use to connect :S? ..
2009-05-28T14:41:00.000Z	h4mx0r	DanDan	wicd isn't bad, comes with default network manager. But I don't use either. wireless tools from command line such as iwlist and iwconfig etc are good. If you edit /etc/resolv.conf and /etc/network/interfaces you should be able to ifup your wireless
2009-05-28T14:42:00.000Z	DanDan	h4mx0r	: this is the dpkg --reconfigure output I got http://pastebin.com/m30725298
2009-05-28T14:49:00.000Z	h4mx0r	DanDan	no clue all I know is its something to do with using a dpkg command to fix it
2009-05-28T14:50:00.000Z	DanDan	h4mx0r	 : do u know anyone who can help me with that !
2009-05-28T14:51:00.000Z	h4mx0r	DanDan	dpkg --configure -a try that
2009-05-28T14:53:00.000Z	DanDan	h4mx0r	 : nothing happened
2009-05-28T14:54:00.000Z	h4mx0r	DanDan	did you try removing it fully and reinstalling it?
2009-05-28T14:55:00.000Z	DanDan	h4mx0r	 : flashplugin yes ! its too stubborn that it wont even be removed !!
2009-05-28T14:55:00.000Z	h4mx0r	DanDan	hang on I'll check the package and tell you which directories it creates to delete it manually
