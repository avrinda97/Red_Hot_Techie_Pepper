2009-09-30T16:43:00.000Z	shadowmancer		hey all
2009-09-30T16:43:00.000Z	shadowmancer		i'm looking for some clarification here
2009-09-30T16:43:00.000Z	shadowmancer		i got 9.04 on an intel celeron 2.6 single core
2009-09-30T16:43:00.000Z	shadowmancer		and its runnning like windows vista but slower\
2009-09-30T16:43:00.000Z	shadowmancer		its got a gig of ram
2009-09-30T16:43:00.000Z	shadowmancer		and a radeon 9250
2009-09-30T16:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shadowmancer	what video card?
2009-09-30T16:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shadowmancer	have you installed at ATi driver for your card yet?
2009-09-30T16:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shadowmancer	are you running desktop effects per chance?
2009-09-30T16:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shadowmancer	could use a lighter DE like LXDE, XFCE, Fluxbox etc
2009-09-30T16:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shadowmancer	WoW will still run no matter what DE you use
2009-09-30T16:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shadowmancer	none at all, a lighter DE will just be more responsive on the desktop, when the game runs it will be fullscren so it doesnt matter
2009-09-30T16:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shadowmancer	it does that, try a lighter browser like swiftfox, kazenchase or firepup
2009-09-30T16:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shadowmancer	or try opera, chromium etc
2009-09-30T16:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shadowmancer	that too, or midori
2009-09-30T16:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shadowmancer	despite what people think, there are more browsers than firefox
2009-09-30T16:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shadowmancer	try firepup or swiftfox, they are lighter in ram
2009-09-30T16:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shadowmancer	you can set your swappiness to 1 and it should be nicer
2009-09-30T16:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shadowmancer	i just give 2gb regardless
2009-09-30T16:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shadowmancer	if you set the swappiness to a low value the system will try and keep the running system in ram rather than use the swap
2009-09-30T17:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shadowmancer	try some better configs, there are guides all over
