2011-12-08T15:48:00.000Z	mazda01	Sidewinder1	thanks, ive been dealing with the issue for over 2 years and I've tried "thousands" of configs only to come to same issue
2011-12-08T15:49:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	mazda01	Doesn't sound like fun. :-(
2011-12-08T15:54:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	mazda01	I'm sure, after 2 yr.s you've seen this; if not, try posting your problem on the last page: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=281865&highlight=conky
2011-12-08T15:54:00.000Z	mazda01	Sidewinder1	im well aware of the forums. not bragging but i have almost 5,000 posts
2011-12-08T15:55:00.000Z	mazda01	Sidewinder1	im a busy body helper most times.
2011-12-08T15:55:00.000Z	mazda01	Sidewinder1	but this silly conky issue had me on my knees. LOL
2011-12-08T15:55:00.000Z	mazda01	Sidewinder1	i am dannyboy79 on the forums
2011-12-08T15:56:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	mazda01	I haven't been on too much, lately; only a couple of hundred beans..
2011-12-08T15:57:00.000Z	mazda01	Sidewinder1	it's all good. as i said I wasn't trying to brag about my bean count I was merely showing proof that I was aware of the forums
2011-12-08T15:57:00.000Z	mazda01	Sidewinder1	like I said, been using ubuntu since dapper
2011-12-08T15:59:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	mazda01	But, did you post your problem in the thread that I gave you? It started in Oct. '06 and is over 1,800 pages long..
2011-12-08T15:59:00.000Z	mazda01	Sidewinder1	no because as I stated. I never really cared enough to figure it out, much more pressing things to work on. It's all fixed now and thats good
2011-12-08T16:00:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	mazda01	If the guys/gals who frequent that thread can't answer, there may be 'no answer." :-(
2011-12-08T16:01:00.000Z	mazda01	Sidewinder1	it's working, maybe you missed that I said I solved it
2011-12-08T16:31:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	mazda01	Same, here.
2011-12-18T16:33:00.000Z	mazda01	Sidewinder1	you're not from Florida are you?
2011-12-18T16:33:00.000Z	mazda01	Sidewinder1	lol, i know someone with your "handle" from florida
2011-12-18T16:34:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	mazda01	No, I'm not but have enjoyed my visits, there.
2011-12-18T16:35:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	mazda01	And, you're exactly correct; it was my "handle", back in the CB days (the 70s).
