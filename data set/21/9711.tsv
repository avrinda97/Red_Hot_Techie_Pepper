2005-07-28T09:00:00.000Z	Super_BQ		you guys using Samba for network file sharing?
2005-07-28T09:00:00.000Z	Super_BQ		why not keep it in native unix format?
2005-07-28T09:01:00.000Z	Super_BQ		I actually have a problem with firestarter (firewall) and my Samba
2005-07-28T09:01:00.000Z	CarlFK	Super_BQ	- so dump firestarter ;)
2005-07-28T09:02:00.000Z	CarlFK	Super_BQ	- so dump firestarter - really.
2005-07-28T09:02:00.000Z	Super_BQ	CarlFK	it looks like a nice program.. everything else works (SSH, FTP, etc.)
2005-07-28T09:02:00.000Z	CarlFK	Super_BQ	- what problem does firestarter solve?
2005-07-28T09:03:00.000Z	Super_BQ	CarlFK	i'm not competent to use iptables to build a decent firewall
2005-07-28T09:03:00.000Z	Super_BQ	CarlFK	what are you using for firewall/routing?
2005-07-28T09:03:00.000Z	CarlFK	Super_BQ	- so dont.  again - what problem are you trying to solve?
2005-07-28T09:04:00.000Z	CarlFK	Super_BQ	- for routing I use shorewall - the problme it solves is getting my other boxes on the net.  - is that what your samba box is doing?
2005-07-28T09:05:00.000Z	CarlFK	Super_BQ	- what whould you loose if you didn't use the firewall?
2005-07-28T09:06:00.000Z	Super_BQ	CarlFK	well i don't know how to configure ipforwarding for the LAN windoze boxes (so http doesn't route)
2005-07-28T09:06:00.000Z	Super_BQ	CarlFK	anotherwords, firestarter would automatically route for me but kills my SMB LAN connection
2005-07-28T09:07:00.000Z	CarlFK	Super_BQ	- got it.  so it is a gateway box, and you do need something to make it a gateway.
2005-07-28T09:07:00.000Z	Super_BQ	CarlFK	yes
2005-07-28T09:08:00.000Z	CarlFK	Super_BQ	- I see lots of people wanting to run a firewall on a desktop box and all it does it cause problems
2005-07-28T09:08:00.000Z	Super_BQ	CarlFK	no it's only a PII-266Mhz box so no point running as a desktop also
2005-07-28T09:09:00.000Z	Super_BQ	CarlFK	is shore? a gui like firestarter in Gnome?
2005-07-28T09:10:00.000Z	CarlFK	Super_BQ	- no - lots of config files.  I got it to work, but it was kinda a pain
2005-07-28T09:10:00.000Z	Super_BQ	CarlFK	k. brb phone
