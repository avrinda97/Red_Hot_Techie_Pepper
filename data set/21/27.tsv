2005-02-08T10:41:00.000Z	cowbud		it doesn't matter
2005-02-08T10:41:00.000Z	cowbud		you might not see all the changes until a reboot but blah
2005-02-08T10:42:00.000Z	cowbud		nothing an apt-get -f install doesn't fix
2005-02-08T10:42:00.000Z	cowbud		but it rarely happens..
2005-02-08T10:42:00.000Z	jdub	cowbud	unrelated
2005-02-08T10:42:00.000Z	jdub	cowbud	he's asking about things breaking if upgraded while running
2005-02-08T11:04:00.000Z	cowbud	jdub	sweet
2005-02-08T11:07:00.000Z	cowbud	jdub	so how does ubuntu get around the inotify dep of beagle or does the ubuntu kernel already have that patch installed?
2005-02-08T11:07:00.000Z	jdub	cowbud	had inotify for ages :)
2005-02-08T11:07:00.000Z	jdub	cowbud	latest kernel has inotify 0.18
2005-02-08T11:07:00.000Z	cowbud	jdub	ahh
2005-02-08T11:07:00.000Z	cowbud	jdub	what about networkmanager is that being worked in?
2005-02-08T11:08:00.000Z	jdub	cowbud	not for hoary
2005-02-08T11:28:00.000Z	cowbud	jdub	that was kinda an indirect way of asking if a bug report would help in the matter or if someone had already said no to this since both ubuntu an debian do not do it (i.e. making x-chat register wtih gnome as a irc:// handler..)
2005-02-08T11:29:00.000Z	jdub	cowbud	dunno
2005-02-08T11:29:00.000Z	cowbud	jdub	ahh what the hell I am already on the page..
2005-02-08T11:29:00.000Z	jdub	cowbud	if you can come up with a patch or whatever to do it, that'd be swet.
2005-02-17T07:27:00.000Z	jdub	cowbud	you don't, remove fam
2005-02-17T07:27:00.000Z	cowbud	jdub	 excellent :)
