2009-07-23T16:51:00.000Z	liri		is it possible to disable the trash can completely? (items will be deleted completely)
2009-07-23T16:52:00.000Z	lorenzosu	liri	Doing SHIFT + DEL should bypass trash, but be careful when doing it.
2009-07-23T17:02:00.000Z	liri	lorenzosu	I know, but I want to remove the trash can itself (I don't want files deleted without SHIFT+DEL to go there)
2009-07-23T17:03:00.000Z	lorenzosu	liri	May I ask why. Having the trash can is usually a good option.
2009-07-23T17:04:00.000Z	liri	lorenzosu	I just don't need it
2009-07-23T17:07:00.000Z	liri	lorenzosu	strikes me odd that such a thing isn't confiurable
2009-07-23T17:07:00.000Z	liri		*configurable
2009-07-23T17:07:00.000Z	lorenzosu	liri	I'm sure there's a way. Simply though you can do rm to delete a file forever.. so maybe more advanced users simply use the terminal
2009-07-23T17:08:00.000Z	lorenzosu	liri	Anyhow let me stress that using some sort of "trash" mechanism is a safeguard to errors... And human error is one of the #1 causes for data loss ;)
2009-07-23T17:12:00.000Z	liri	lorenzosu	which means there's no possiblity to disable it I take it...
2009-07-23T17:12:00.000Z	lorenzosu	liri	I didn't say that.
2009-07-23T17:16:00.000Z	liri	lorenzosu	you aren't say how to disable it either :) so I'm guessing it's not supported or something
2009-07-23T17:16:00.000Z	lorenzosu	liri	There should be an option in nautilus>preferences in the gnome-conf
2009-07-23T17:20:00.000Z	liri	lorenzosu	thank you
2009-07-23T17:43:00.000Z	liri	lorenzosu	in nautilus > preferences > I found enable_delete and set it to true but that doesn't take, deleting a file still goes to the trashcan
2009-07-23T17:44:00.000Z	lorenzosu	liri	Have you tried restarting the session?
2009-07-23T17:44:00.000Z	liri	lorenzosu	I restarted the system :)
2009-07-23T17:44:00.000Z	liri		I'll make another test
2009-07-23T17:44:00.000Z	lorenzosu	liri	I don't know then, sorry.
2009-07-23T17:54:00.000Z	liri	lorenzosu	sorry for misleading you. it works with the right click- >delete option but not with the delete button on the keyboard
2009-07-23T17:55:00.000Z	lorenzosu	liri	I guess that would be a bug or something
