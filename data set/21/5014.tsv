2008-01-14T00:39:00.000Z	john47		hello, can someone help me with my ubuntu installation that went horribly wrong?
2008-01-14T00:40:00.000Z	duudii	john47	what seems to be the problem?
2008-01-14T00:41:00.000Z	duudii	john47	upon pressing the reset button, does it do it again?
2008-01-14T00:44:00.000Z	duudii	john47	then for some reason your GRUB is unable to load, you could try installing it again. Search for GRUB disc, or pop in the live CD. This might work, but i wouldnt know for sure...
2008-01-14T00:46:00.000Z	duudii	john47	so its working? good stuff, good luck on your quest ;)
2008-01-14T00:47:00.000Z	john47	duudii	actually, I am totally new at linux and I don't know what to do with the grub prompt
2008-01-14T00:48:00.000Z	duudii	john47	GRUB is basically where you choose which OS you want to boot. Should have your Gutsy on top, and Windows (if installed) below...
2008-01-14T00:50:00.000Z	duudii	john47	no, you should have the option of just hitting 'enter'... but there appears to be something wrong with it if this isn't the case
2008-01-14T00:50:00.000Z	duudii	john47	try a reboot, again... see if it works...
2008-01-14T00:52:00.000Z	john47	duudii	I got the grub boot screen and clicked the ubuntu startup - Looks good so far, but I'm not sure how stable this is...
2008-01-14T00:53:00.000Z	john47	duudii	If it's a GRUB problem I'm dealing with, can I repair GRUB somehow while I'm in Ubuntu perhaps?
2008-01-14T00:54:00.000Z	duudii	john47	Actually i don't think so...
2008-01-14T00:55:00.000Z	duudii	john47	GRUB is only there for those who want to use multiple OSÃƒ's
2008-01-14T00:56:00.000Z	john47	duudii	Could this be the result of a faulty install or bad ISO?  Should I try to burn another ISO and try to reinstall Gutsy over the other Gutsy install maybe?
2008-01-14T00:57:00.000Z	duudii	john47	If you want, you can... there should, however, be the option of just re-installing the GRUB
2008-01-14T00:59:00.000Z	john47	duudii	Ok, thanks a lot for your thoughts and ideas...I'll play around with it and see if I can get it going again (I'm dual booting Gutsy and Windows 2000 SP4).
2008-01-14T01:02:00.000Z	duudii	john47	Sounds like a hardware issue... could be fixed with the good ol' reset ;)
2008-01-14T02:54:00.000Z	duudii	john47	is your X server failing or what?
2008-01-14T02:56:00.000Z	john47	duudii	I can't boot from a gutsy live cd.  After the boot screen, all I get are I/O errors
2008-01-14T02:58:00.000Z	duudii	john47	by bootscreen you mean grub? or the ubuntu login screen?
2008-01-14T03:01:00.000Z	duudii	john47	sounds bad! i don't think i know how to help, sorry
