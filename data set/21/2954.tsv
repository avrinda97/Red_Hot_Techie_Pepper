2009-07-15T21:27:00.000Z	Doc-Saintly		Does anyone have a guide for starting the xterminal login remotely? I'm logged in through SSH, but can't VNC in. I've seen various "guides" on how to do this but they all involve installing a different vnc server. This seems like a waste because ubuntu already has one if it supports it when logged in.
2009-07-15T21:28:00.000Z	fccf	Doc-Saintly	consider doing ssh -X
2009-07-15T21:29:00.000Z	Doc-Saintly	fccf	can you elaborate? I'm using putty to ssh in.
2009-07-15T21:30:00.000Z	fccf	Doc-Saintly	I use UltraVNC from windows to connect to vino - the ubuntu desktop standard VNC server .... not sure what you are getting at .. or need to do
2009-07-15T21:31:00.000Z	Doc-Saintly	fccf	I do the same. maybe i'm not understanding what ssh -X is, or whether i can do it with putty
2009-07-15T21:32:00.000Z	Doc-Saintly	fccf	I use ultravnc as well, but the vnc server doesn't start up on my machine until someone physically logs in to the machine, ssh'ing doesn't cut it it seems
2009-07-15T21:33:00.000Z	fccf	Doc-Saintly	ssh -X is tunneling X over ssh ... and is very difficult to do in windows .. if you have the resources you could do it in a virtual machine on windows
2009-07-15T21:34:00.000Z	Doc-Saintly	fccf	that's what I thought. Yea i'm stuck with vnc, but i find it hard to believe there's not a way to make the already installed server run with an ssh login instead of installing a secondary server
2009-07-15T21:35:00.000Z	fccf	Doc-Saintly	the already installed server was meant for support/learning purposes, cause by default it is a shared screen, wasn't really meant for admin... although I use it everyday for that
2009-07-15T21:36:00.000Z	Doc-Saintly	fccf	I don't mind if it's a shared screen, i would probably prefer it activate a screen on the server and move the cursor around on it etc.
2009-07-15T21:37:00.000Z	fccf	Doc-Saintly	best bet would to be to leave the remote machine logged in ... just use lock screen when you leave ... when you logon via VNC the machine will come out of lock and be visible until you logout
2009-07-15T21:53:00.000Z	Doc-Saintly	fccf	that works until I remotely run an update and restart it.
2009-07-15T21:55:00.000Z	fccf	Doc-Saintly	why don't you have it auto-login and lock
2009-07-15T21:55:00.000Z	Doc-Saintly	fccf	probably because i don't know how to do that either ;)
2009-07-15T21:57:00.000Z	fccf	Doc-Saintly	look here http://www.watchingthenet.com/how-to-enable-automati-logon-in-ubuntu-or-kubuntu.html
2009-07-15T22:16:00.000Z	Doc-Saintly	fccf	any idea how to do this from the commandline? I don't have gui access atm
2009-07-15T22:17:00.000Z	fccf	Doc-Saintly	give me a min
