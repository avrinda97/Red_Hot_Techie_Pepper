2010-02-22T09:56:00.000Z	i3inary		hello
2010-02-22T09:58:00.000Z	i3inary		can someone help me figure out how to move an ubuntu 9.10 installation to a virtual machine?  basically it would be like restoring a configuration to new hardware.  can someone help point me in the right direction?
2010-02-22T09:59:00.000Z	i3inary		you have a button on your foot?
2010-02-22T10:00:00.000Z	i3inary		could you press it and restore my backup for me then...?
2010-02-22T10:02:00.000Z	i3inary		so is this the place for dick and fart jokes?
2010-02-22T10:02:00.000Z	chetnick	i3inary	install Ubuntu on VM, then extract the backup there.
2010-02-22T10:03:00.000Z	i3inary	chetnick	ok i have the vm set up with ubuntu now...so i can just "sudo cp -R /backup/* /" and im done?
2010-02-22T10:04:00.000Z	chetnick	i3inary	i would suggest doing that in single user mode.
2010-02-22T10:04:00.000Z	chetnick	i3inary	yes that would be it, if its a complete backup.
2010-02-22T10:04:00.000Z	chetnick	i3inary	use sudo cp -ax /backup/* /
2010-02-22T10:05:00.000Z	i3inary	chetnick	so i dont have to worry about excluding any files that would mess up the drivers on the new installation?
2010-02-22T10:05:00.000Z	chetnick	i3inary	new installation would be pretty much overwriten with your backup.
2010-02-22T10:06:00.000Z	chetnick	i3inary	but that is what you want? And by the way what drivers do you use on VM?
2010-02-22T10:07:00.000Z	i3inary	chetnick	right i understand that the new install is getting overwritten...im just wondering how it will boot if it gets a bunch of incompatible drivers in its configuration files
2010-02-22T10:07:00.000Z	chetnick	i3inary	your new install is Virtual Machine?
2010-02-22T10:08:00.000Z	i3inary	chetnick	correct but it has drivers they are just for simulated hardware no?
2010-02-22T10:08:00.000Z	chetnick	i3inary	from my experience (VMWare) you have now worries about drivers when it comes to virtual machine.
2010-02-22T10:09:00.000Z	i3inary	chetnick	alright. ok so you are saying if i boot a linux install and the configuration files are not compatible with the hardware it will just not use them?
2010-02-22T10:10:00.000Z	chetnick	i3inary	what i'm saying is VM does not have hardware, drivers used in Ubuntu cannot be used on virtual machine.
2010-02-22T10:13:00.000Z	i3inary	chetnick	ok im giving it a try ill just revert to the snapshot if it doesnt work...which is the main reason i am moving the physical box to the virtual machine in the first place
2010-02-22T10:14:00.000Z	chetnick	i3inary	you can always come back to most recent snapshot, but i'm 99% sure you'll be fine.
