2008-01-09T15:42:00.000Z	shyal		Hi
2008-01-09T15:43:00.000Z	shyal		I've done something very stupid and need help
2008-01-09T15:43:00.000Z	shyal		after ubuntu auto mounted my mp3 player
2008-01-09T15:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shyal	Let us know as clearly as you can what you did.. and see who can help
2008-01-09T15:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shyal	what brand of player is this?
2008-01-09T15:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shyal	Are you looking to use gparted or a cli tool to reformat it to fat or whatever it was?
2008-01-09T15:50:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shyal	Like the error says it isnt a supported file system
2008-01-09T15:51:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shyal	sudo fdisk -l > ~/Desktop/Partition.Layout.$(date +%m-%d-%Y-%T).txt    and see what it shows, use pastebin to post it for me.
2008-01-09T15:52:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shyal	np
2008-01-09T15:53:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shyal	Checking now
2008-01-09T15:54:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shyal	good news.. it is still fat  format on that player
2008-01-09T15:57:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shyal	What is giving you that error?  or is iaudio just a mount point
2008-01-09T15:59:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shyal	and under volume..file system it shows..?
2008-01-09T16:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shyal	do the same thing again   but put in there vfat
2008-01-09T16:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shyal	Could you pastebin this for me    cp /etc/fstab ~/Desktop/fstab.$(date +%m-%d-%Y-%T)
2008-01-09T16:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shyal	Agreed.. not in there...I assume you have shut down removed it, restarted and reinserted it to see if it sautomounts correctly
2008-01-09T16:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shyal	so. fstab shows vfat but properties under the mount show iaudio...
2008-01-09T16:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shyal	I dont want to have you do something that I am not sure will fix that.. I have never had anyone do something like that.. and I am not sure how to fix it at this point.  I would think mounting it with force might let you in..
2008-01-09T16:17:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shyal	that is a good thing...  sorry I wasnt more help
2008-01-09T16:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shyal	great news
2008-01-09T16:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shyal	I would never have thought to look in there
