2012-08-18T08:24:00.000Z	`4fun`		hey guys, i portforwarded port 113 for irc identd to my ubuntu server but it still acts as if its not enabled
2012-08-18T08:24:00.000Z	`4fun`		is there something i need to install to enable identd on ubuntu server?
2012-08-18T08:25:00.000Z	jagginess	`4fun`	modern clients can simulate or there are router boxes that simulate it sometimes..
2012-08-18T08:25:00.000Z	jagginess	`4fun`	it's an old relic that isn't very necessary..
2012-08-18T08:25:00.000Z	`4fun`	jagginess	what isnt necessary?
2012-08-18T08:25:00.000Z	jagginess	`4fun`	it's possible your router box is not allowing to port forward 113
2012-08-18T08:26:00.000Z	`4fun`	jagginess	its the port is forwarded to my ubuntu server already
2012-08-18T08:27:00.000Z	jagginess	`4fun`	the box may say its configured it's doing port forward to 113, but it may not be doing it because it's already doing some kind of identd on it's own
2012-08-18T08:27:00.000Z	jagginess	`4fun`	identd is basically something of a relic
2012-08-18T08:28:00.000Z	`4fun`	jagginess	the router does nothing but forward port 113.. there isnt anything else invloved, atleast i think so.. and i didnt do anything to my ubuntu server about identd
2012-08-18T08:29:00.000Z	jagginess	`4fun`	you should ask on #freenode what you're after about irc's..
2012-08-18T08:29:00.000Z	jagginess	`4fun`	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identd identd is dead :/
2012-08-18T08:30:00.000Z	jagginess	`4fun`	they would know about identd
2012-08-18T08:32:00.000Z	jagginess	`4fun`	sounds like you're setting up a server that does ident checking
2012-08-18T08:33:00.000Z	jagginess	`4fun`	to understand what can simulate an ident response, you can ask on #freenode
2012-08-18T08:33:00.000Z	jagginess	`4fun`	sounds like you're setting up an irc server
2012-08-18T08:35:00.000Z	jagginess	`4fun`	port 113 is identd. You'll have to know about it. :) (read online)
2012-08-18T08:38:00.000Z	`4fun`	jagginess	installing oidentd fixed the issue.. now port 113 is Open and IRC sees it as enabled..
2012-08-18T08:39:00.000Z	jagginess	`4fun`	and the people at #freenode would know too :) lol.. whatever you're trying to do
2012-08-18T08:39:00.000Z	jagginess	`4fun`	identd is sort of dead, but tends to stick around with irc stuff
2012-08-18T08:40:00.000Z	`4fun`	jagginess	thats not what you said, you were talking as if my router is actually doing that and it doesnt
