2005-09-21T05:53:00.000Z	ripgut		ok, it didnt work with or without the disk, god wtf, all i wanna do is use a floppy
2005-09-21T05:53:00.000Z	ripgut		youd think ubuntu would come with native floppy drive support
2005-09-21T05:53:00.000Z	ripgut		thx bob but i dont need your fanboyish opinion
2005-09-21T05:54:00.000Z	ripgut		so i cant use a floppy disk taht has ms word files on it? or what?
2005-09-21T05:55:00.000Z	ripgut		i installed mtools but how do i use it
2005-09-21T05:56:00.000Z	ripgut		"mount" just lists the cd rom drives
2005-09-21T05:56:00.000Z	ripgut		i came here for help not opinions
2005-09-21T05:56:00.000Z	ripgut		insert more coins please
2005-09-21T05:58:00.000Z	ripgut		ok well taht didnt work either cafuego
2005-09-21T05:58:00.000Z	ripgut		it says cannot initialize "a" no such device or address
2005-09-21T05:59:00.000Z	robzon	ripgut	type cat /dev/fd0 > /dev/null and see if the drive works :)
2005-09-21T06:00:00.000Z	robzon	ripgut	don't worry, linux gets better and better... :) try cat /dev/fd0 > /dev/null and see if the drive works
2005-09-21T06:01:00.000Z	robzon	ripgut	that means that the driver isn't loaded
2005-09-21T06:01:00.000Z	robzon	ripgut	sudo modprobe floppy
2005-09-21T06:02:00.000Z	robzon	ripgut	so it seems more of a hardware problem.. and modprobe simply doesn't display anything if it succeeds
2005-09-21T06:03:00.000Z	robzon	ripgut	BIOS always detects floppy and it's always in computer
2005-09-21T06:03:00.000Z	robzon	ripgut	I don't even have a floppy, but my BIOS thinks I have, and I also have floppy in my computer :)
2005-09-21T06:06:00.000Z	robzon	ripgut	does the floppy's light even go on?
2005-09-21T06:07:00.000Z	robzon	ripgut	mount -t vfat /dev/fd0 /media/floppy
2005-09-21T06:07:00.000Z	robzon	ripgut	sudo mount -t vfat /dev/fd0 /media/floppy :)
2005-09-21T06:11:00.000Z	robzon	ripgut	unfortunately, floppies are very unreliable :/
