2010-11-13T08:21:00.000Z	daveorme		Fonts are broken in my Ubuntu 10.10 machine.  mktextfm dies and Inkscape can see font names but not render them.  Google isn't helping.  Where should I look?
2010-11-13T08:22:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	daveorme	did you install custom fonts?
2010-11-13T08:22:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	daveorme	in terminal run fc-cache -vf
2010-11-13T08:23:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	daveorme	that should force your font cache to check for all new fonts
2010-11-13T08:23:00.000Z	daveorme	ubuntu4shane	I installed the Microsoft TrueType font package when I first installed
2010-11-13T08:23:00.000Z	daveorme	ubuntu4shane	Tried the command...
2010-11-13T08:24:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	daveorme	did you see a bunch of text in the terminal?  should have updated all the fonts on the system
2010-11-13T08:26:00.000Z	daveorme	ubuntu4shane	Yes; I saw the text.  Status: Tex still broken.  Inkscape previews the fonts in the dropdown but won't let me pick any--always reverts to Bitstream Vera Sans and displays a little (!) next to it.  Ooo works.
2010-11-13T08:26:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	daveorme	hmm, that seems odd, perhaps re-install Inkscape, I would think if it is a font problem, it would be universal,
2010-11-13T08:27:00.000Z	daveorme	ubuntu4shane	I can try that.  Odd that both Inkscape and Tex have troubles, but not Ooo...  Hmmmm
2010-11-13T08:28:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	daveorme	yes, that is odd, you didn't manually put any fonts in the font folder did you?
2010-11-13T08:28:00.000Z	daveorme	ubuntu4shane	Nope.
2010-11-13T08:29:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	daveorme	the only problems I have seen with fonts issues, is when I put the fonts in the folder, and mess up permissions, that gets ugly.  I really think it is a inkscape issue.
2010-11-13T08:30:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	daveorme	you can try to move the inkscape folder, in your /home  to back it up, like cp .inkscape .inkscape.bak  and then re-open inkscape
2010-11-13T08:31:00.000Z	daveorme	ubuntu4shane	That's a good idea.  I'll try that.
2010-11-13T08:31:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	daveorme	never mind that, it doesn't exist, let me track it down
2010-11-13T08:32:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	daveorme	ok, in the terminal with inkscape closed try this:  cp ~/.config/inkscape ~/.config/inkscape.bak
2010-11-13T08:32:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	daveorme	then open inkscape and see if it was a config problem
2010-11-13T08:32:00.000Z	daveorme	ubuntu4shane	Cool; thanks
2010-11-13T08:35:00.000Z	daveorme	ubuntu4shane	That fixed Inkscape; just have to get Tex fixed now.  But wife wants attention so that will have to wait. :)  Thanks ubuntu4shane!
2010-11-13T08:35:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	daveorme	no prob
