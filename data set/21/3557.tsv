2010-03-24T16:36:00.000Z	soreau	ja660k	Are other compiz effects working?
2010-03-24T16:36:00.000Z	ja660k	soreau	im not sure; so im going to assume no
2010-03-24T16:36:00.000Z	soreau	ja660k	Ok, I'm going to assume you don't have compiz enabled
2010-03-24T16:36:00.000Z	soreau	ja660k	To enable it, open gnome-appearance-properties (System > Preferences > Appearance) and set the radio button to anything other than None in the Visual Effects tab.
2010-03-24T16:37:00.000Z	ja660k	soreau	right... now what?
2010-03-24T16:38:00.000Z	soreau	ja660k	Was it set to None?
2010-03-24T16:38:00.000Z	ja660k	soreau	yes.
2010-03-24T16:38:00.000Z	soreau	ja660k	And now?
2010-03-24T16:38:00.000Z	ja660k	soreau	still nothing
2010-03-24T16:38:00.000Z	soreau	ja660k	ok, restart ccsm and re-enable Annotate, then try Super+Alt+Drag to draw
2010-03-24T16:39:00.000Z	ja660k	soreau	/etc/init.d/ccsm restart? or how can i restart it
2010-03-24T16:39:00.000Z	soreau	ja660k	Simply close the ccsm window, then open it again
2010-03-24T16:39:00.000Z	ja660k	soreau	brb
