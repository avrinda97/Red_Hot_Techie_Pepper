2006-09-10T16:57:00.000Z	wikijeff		After installing windows how can I get Grub to be recognized again for dual boot?? I tried reinstalling it from the liveCD, but that didn't work.

2006-09-10T16:58:00.000Z	wikijeff	Flannel	thanks
2006-09-10T05:01:00.000Z	wikijeff	Flannel	During the process should I reformat / and swap?
2006-09-10T05:02:00.000Z	Flannel	wikijeff	you shouldn't need to...
2006-09-10T05:03:00.000Z	wikijeff	Flannel	It says go to manual partitioning in the installer
2006-09-10T05:03:00.000Z	Flannel	wikijeff	look at number 5 ;)
2006-09-10T05:04:00.000Z	wikijeff	Flannel	Grub Resources??? It's just a bunch of links
2006-09-10T05:05:00.000Z	Flannel	wikijeff	no, 5 under "Using the Install CD and overwriting the Windows bootloader"
2006-09-10T05:06:00.000Z	wikijeff	Flannel	Ok, it says it must format /, /boot, /usr, /var though
2006-09-10T05:06:00.000Z	Flannel	wikijeff	No it doesnt.  DONT format them
2006-09-10T05:07:00.000Z	Flannel	wikijeff	which installer are you using?
2006-09-10T05:08:00.000Z	wikijeff	Flannel	I just downloaded and burned 6.06 Live CD and I'm using the Installer located on the desktop
2006-09-10T05:08:00.000Z	Flannel	wikijeff	ah, you need to scroll down to the "using the ubuntu lvieCD" part then
2006-09-10T05:08:00.000Z	wikijeff	Flannel	ok, thanks
2006-09-10T05:10:00.000Z	wikijeff	Flannel	How do I find out what my harddisk + boot partition numbers are?? i.e. (hd0,6)
2006-09-10T05:11:00.000Z	Flannel	wikijeff	hard disk number is easy, partition number depends on your setup.  primary IDE drives are 0 (master) and slave (1), secondary are 2 and 3 respectively
2006-10-24T06:08:00.000Z	Flannel	wikijeff	is /home on it's own partition?
2006-10-24T06:08:00.000Z	wikijeff	Flannel	no it isn't. Ljl, what' the alternate CD?
2006-10-24T06:09:00.000Z	Flannel	wikijeff	you should think about putting /home on it's own partition, then you can reinstall 'around' your home partition
