2011-07-17T21:09:00.000Z	clean	zykotick9	thanks, I'll try that
2011-07-17T21:09:00.000Z	zykotick9	clean	try what?  eol?
2011-07-17T21:10:00.000Z	clean	zykotick9	try dist-upgrade to LTS
2011-07-17T21:10:00.000Z	zykotick9	clean	good luck with that.  personally fresh install would be my recommendation.
2011-07-17T21:11:00.000Z	clean	zykotick9	my last failure was caused by not enough disk space
2011-07-17T21:11:00.000Z	clean	zykotick9	but i think fresh install require too much work after installation
2011-07-17T21:11:00.000Z	zykotick9	clean	if you're already out of disk space - upgrading to a new version will not help, and will probably fail?!
2011-07-17T21:12:00.000Z	clean	zykotick9	I know, I mean that the last time I tried to upgrade from 9.04 to 9.10,  it failed because disk space
2011-07-17T21:13:00.000Z	clean	zykotick9	fresh install can lost many nice tools I have installed and configured
2011-07-17T21:13:00.000Z	zykotick9	clean	honestly, i wish you luck and hope it works out.  i don't think upgrading from version to version in ubuntu is a particularly wise idea, but YMMV.
2011-07-17T21:13:00.000Z	clean	zykotick9	yes, I also thinks it no that safe to upgrade from one version to anther
2011-07-17T21:15:00.000Z	zykotick9	clean	three letters for ya L T S ;)
2011-07-17T21:16:00.000Z	clean	zykotick9	I am considering fresh install of server LTS, they support 5 years long
2011-07-17T21:16:00.000Z	zykotick9	clean	don't bother!  the packages you want: X, desktop apps, etc are only supported 3 years - same as Desktop!
2011-07-17T21:17:00.000Z	clean	zykotick9	really? 5 for server
2011-07-17T21:17:00.000Z	zykotick9	clean	some real "server" packages are supported for 5 years yes, but much of the repository is NOT
2011-07-17T21:18:00.000Z	clean	zykotick9	oh, ok...
2011-07-17T21:19:00.000Z	zykotick9	clean	ubuntu's lts desktop is probably the longest supported "desktop" version - that you don't have to RH for ;)
2011-07-17T21:20:00.000Z	zykotick9	clean	s/have to RH for/have to pay RH for/
2011-07-17T21:20:00.000Z	clean	zykotick9	hmmm thanks:p
