2009-08-29T16:42:00.000Z	Peddy	Shasirax	that's most likely a graphics card problem... what graphics does your machine have?
2009-08-29T16:43:00.000Z	Shasirax	Peddy	I have a ATI x1950, this happend when i was trying to install drivers for it, im running with a live cd now :)
2009-08-29T16:46:00.000Z	Peddy	Shasirax	just before it boots, can you hit ctrl-alt-F1
2009-08-29T16:46:00.000Z	Peddy	Shasirax	before the GUI starts*
2009-08-29T16:48:00.000Z	Shasirax		Paddy: Do you have any clue?
2009-08-29T16:48:00.000Z	Shasirax		Paddy, sry... my comp bugged :P
2009-08-29T16:49:00.000Z	Shasirax		Paddy: GUI?
2009-08-29T16:49:00.000Z	Peddy		oh, sorry Shasirax

2009-08-29T16:49:00.000Z	Shasirax		?
2009-08-29T16:49:00.000Z	Peddy	Shasirax	I've heard of people just using 8.04 LTS or 8.10 to get older ATi cards to work... it's ridiculous and inconvenient, but you may have to do it.
2009-08-29T16:50:00.000Z	Peddy	Shasirax	don't worry about the ctrl-alt-F1 thing for now.
2009-08-29T16:50:00.000Z	Shasirax		yes, but i cant start my computer... thats the problem
2009-08-29T16:51:00.000Z	Peddy	Shasirax	is it a clean 9.04 install, or did you upgrade from a previous version?
2009-08-29T16:51:00.000Z	Shasirax		it's clean
2009-08-29T16:52:00.000Z	Peddy	Shasirax	do you have wireless or wired internet on that machine?
2009-08-29T16:52:00.000Z	Shasirax		wired, hate wireless :)
2009-08-29T16:52:00.000Z	Peddy	Shasirax	good. OK, I need you to boot the machine, and before the visual corruption happens, press ctrl-alt-F1
2009-08-29T16:53:00.000Z	Shasirax		Paddy: when ubuntu loads?
2009-08-29T16:53:00.000Z	Peddy	Shasirax	yep.
