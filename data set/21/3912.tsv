2009-12-26T20:14:00.000Z	Bohemian		what's the best address book and mail client for windows?
2009-12-26T20:14:00.000Z	Bohemian		thunderbird does address book too?
2009-12-26T20:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Bohemian	there is no best app for anything
2009-12-26T20:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Bohemian	32bit
2009-12-26T20:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Bohemian	the 64bit ISOs, or the 32bit TOO (most 64bit CPUs can run a 32bit OS)
2009-12-26T20:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Bohemian	right click the my computer icon -> properties    it will tell you the cpu
2009-12-26T20:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Bohemian	its cool, its a frequent question but it simply doesnt exist.
2009-12-26T20:31:00.000Z	Bohemian	ActionParsnip1	yeah, i meant the most common, not best, address book and mail client for LINUX. i'll go with thunderbird because she recognizes it from work. i didn't realize thunderbird had an address book as well
2009-12-26T20:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Bohemian	most common doesnt mean anything either, most use windows but a lot of people think its garbage, instead of asking, try a few and see which you like
2009-12-26T20:32:00.000Z	Bohemian	ActionParsnip1	well, can you name a few for linux besides thunderbird?
2009-12-26T20:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Bohemian	for windows?
2009-12-26T20:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Bohemian	http://email.about.com/od/windowsemailclients/tp/free_email_prog.htm
2009-12-26T20:33:00.000Z	Bohemian	ActionParsnip1	for linux, not windows
2009-12-26T20:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Bohemian	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Linux_e-mail_clients
2009-12-26T20:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Bohemian	it doesnt delete anything, it installs to a file in your windows file system
2009-12-26T20:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Bohemian	due to ntfs getting very fragmented, this affects the speed of wubi
2009-12-26T20:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Bohemian	there are more than that but thats a good list to go at (penumbra is one of my favourites as is urban terror)
2009-12-26T21:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Bohemian	you can use aptoncd   to save the debs from one Ubuntu system to another
2009-12-26T21:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Bohemian	quite ironic how you want to use an offline install for an email client thouh. Although it reduces bandwidth used
2009-12-26T21:13:00.000Z	Bohemian	ActionParsnip1	what is aptoncd?
2009-12-26T21:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Bohemian	or you can download the debs from http://packages.ubuntu.com
