2005-11-08T07:21:00.000Z	hsc2104		can anyone tell this newbie how to configure gnome to be able to drag/drop files from one folder to another?
2005-11-08T07:21:00.000Z	hsc2104		using a mouse?
2005-11-08T07:21:00.000Z	NoUse	hsc2104	that is enabled by default
2005-11-08T07:22:00.000Z	hsc2104	NoUse	for some reason i don't have the permission to do that
2005-11-08T07:23:00.000Z	NoUse	hsc2104	you can't drag files into folders outside your home directory
2005-11-08T07:23:00.000Z	NoUse	hsc2104	what error do you get?
2005-11-08T07:25:00.000Z	NoUse	hsc2104	thats not your home directory
2005-11-08T07:26:00.000Z	NoUse	hsc2104	you to use sudo, but why do you need to copy something to that directory?
2005-11-08T07:27:00.000Z	NoUse	hsc2104	you'll either need to run nautilus via sudo or use the command line to copy it via suod
2005-11-08T07:27:00.000Z	hsc2104	NoUse	can you tell me how to run nautilus via sudo?
2005-11-08T07:28:00.000Z	NoUse	hsc2104	open a terminal and type sudo nautilus
2005-11-08T07:29:00.000Z	hsc2104	NoUse	I typed "sudo nautilus" and then my password in terminal, but still get the same error
2005-11-08T07:29:00.000Z	NoUse	hsc2104	you need to copy using only the window that opens when you run that command
2005-11-08T07:30:00.000Z	hsc2104	NoUse	was there supposed to be a window that automatically opens with that command?  I didn't ge any...
2005-11-08T07:31:00.000Z	NoUse	hsc2104	try gksudo nautilus
2005-11-08T07:31:00.000Z	NoUse	hsc2104	don't paste in here
2005-11-08T07:32:00.000Z	NoUse	hsc2104	its easier to just use the command line; sudo cp yourfile /usr/local/bin
2005-11-08T13:24:00.000Z	NoUse	hsc2104	installer for what?
2005-11-08T13:25:00.000Z	hsc2104	NoUse	i mounted Matlab iso's into my filesystem, and I am trying to run the installer
2005-11-08T13:25:00.000Z	hsc2104	NoUse	thanks for helping
2005-11-08T13:34:00.000Z	NoUse	hsc2104	I'd bet there are installation instructions on the CD
