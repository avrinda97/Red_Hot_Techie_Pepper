2011-01-07T04:32:00.000Z	rumpe1	sapsan	overwrite grub-bootloader with the bootloader of any other system and format your ubuntu-partitions
2011-01-07T04:34:00.000Z	sapsan	rumpe1	you mean to download another version?
2011-01-07T04:36:00.000Z	rumpe1	sapsan	you wanted to delete it ...  or is it running in live-mode? (directly from dvd)
2011-01-07T04:37:00.000Z	sapsan	rumpe1	no, it is already installed on HD
2011-01-07T04:38:00.000Z	rumpe1	sapsan	anything else on your HD?
2011-01-07T04:38:00.000Z	rumpe1	sapsan	i mean... any other operating system?
2011-01-07T04:39:00.000Z	sapsan	rumpe1	no, absolutely no!
2011-01-07T04:39:00.000Z	rumpe1	sapsan	then you can also delete it by installing any other system in its place
2011-01-07T04:42:00.000Z	sapsan	rumpe1	no, I can't, I tried to install wndows XP, it says error occured check your disk F, which is my HD
2011-01-07T04:42:00.000Z	rumpe1	sapsan	then check your HD and/or your install-media
2011-01-07T04:43:00.000Z	sapsan	rumpe1	what media? Even my teacher can't fix this
2011-01-07T04:44:00.000Z	rumpe1	sapsan	your xp-install-media. Or download a bootCD with HD-check-utils
2011-01-07T04:47:00.000Z	sapsan	rumpe1	you mean search in internet?
2011-01-07T04:48:00.000Z	rumpe1	sapsan	no... you would have less problems, if they would save their MSoffice-docs in an older format... like Word97 e.g.
