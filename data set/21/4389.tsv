2011-05-13T04:32:00.000Z	boon		anybody knows how to get Tor running on ubuntu?
2011-05-13T04:32:00.000Z	Surlent777	boon	I do. What have you done so far?
2011-05-13T04:34:00.000Z	boon	Surlent777	I installed polipo vidalia and tor
2011-05-13T04:34:00.000Z	Surlent777	boon	okay, I assume you got that from the ppa as directed by the main tor website, correct?
2011-05-13T04:34:00.000Z	boon	Surlent777	yes
2011-05-13T04:35:00.000Z	boon	Surlent777	they did not tell how to verify the pgp keys
2011-05-13T04:35:00.000Z	Surlent777	boon	Vidalia kind of sucks. I have never gotten that to work the way it does under Windows. The best way I've found to make it work is to first copy their example polipo configuration file, overwriting yours. This can be done with "gksudo gedit" and then opening the required file and pasting in their example.
2011-05-13T04:36:00.000Z	Surlent777	boon	From this point, what you do next depends on what you're trying to use it for. For Firefox usage, I recommend "Foxy Proxy". Install that, and in its options where you go to make your masks and crap it'll have an option, I can't remember if it's right-click or in a menu, for a Tor Wizard. Follow that, and turn on Foxy Proxy when you need it.
2011-05-13T04:38:00.000Z	boon	Surlent777	I copied the polipo config to /etc/polipo already
2011-05-13T04:39:00.000Z	boon	Surlent777	even vidalia tells me that it works
2011-05-13T04:39:00.000Z	Surlent777	boon	Excellent. Then for web browsing usage, again, install FoxyProxy and look for its Tor Wizard option
2011-05-13T04:40:00.000Z	boon	Surlent777	weird enough if I enter 127.0.0.1 port 8118 it does not work
2011-05-13T04:40:00.000Z	Surlent777	boon	ActionParsnip might have the right idea there. Forgot to mention that.
2011-05-13T04:40:00.000Z	boon	Surlent777	or should I use localhost?
2011-05-13T04:41:00.000Z	Surlent777	boon	When I set it up, I just used the tor wizard option and accepted the defaults and set the mask for *. Then from there I make sure the fox head is blue (turned on) and then you should be able to try tor's test site or whatismyip.com
2011-05-13T04:43:00.000Z	boon	Surlent777	what is ActionParsnip
2011-05-13T04:43:00.000Z	Surlent777	boon	ActionParsnip is another user who is trying to help you. That guy right there ^
2011-05-13T04:43:00.000Z	boon	Surlent777	OOps
2011-05-13T04:44:00.000Z	Surlent777	boon	A good guy to listen to. He's been around here a good while.
2011-05-13T04:51:00.000Z	boon	Surlent777	thanks for the help bye
2011-05-13T04:52:00.000Z	Surlent777	boon	you're welcome. good luck.
