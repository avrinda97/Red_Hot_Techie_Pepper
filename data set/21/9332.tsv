2005-10-05T06:00:00.000Z	dipnlik		hi all. I want to test ubuntu at work but I can't install it and my PC doesn't have a CD drive. Is it possible to make a boot floppy to load an .iso file on my HD?
2005-10-05T06:01:00.000Z	Knelix	dipnlik	Maybe you can install via LAN?
2005-10-05T06:02:00.000Z	dipnlik	Knelix	maybe, but i can't risk my working windows computer, at least for now
2005-10-05T06:02:00.000Z	Knelix	dipnlik	The link looks pretty promising.
2005-10-05T06:06:00.000Z	dipnlik	Knelix	but it looks like it would boot the CD from the floppy, but I don't have a CD drive on my PC. Will look into the floppy files to see if I can change something there, but not sure (yet)
2005-10-05T06:08:00.000Z	Knelix	dipnlik	Does it have USB, and can it boot off of it? Isn't it possible to expand the ISO onto the drive?
2005-10-05T06:10:00.000Z	dipnlik	Knelix	don't have a flash drive. How can I exapand the ISO?
2005-10-05T06:11:00.000Z	dipnlik	Knelix	i remember having some info on editing grub files to load ISOs, so I think a floppy with grub can be enough for me
2005-10-05T06:12:00.000Z	Knelix	dipnlik	But how will you boot if you have no CD drive?
2005-10-05T06:12:00.000Z	dipnlik	Knelix	can't a floppy boot the livecd iso?
2005-10-05T06:18:00.000Z	Knelix	dipnlik	Sorry, was away. What intelikey said. Floppies are obsolete. I don't understand why the industry hasn't standardized on some flash memory type in place of the floppy.
2005-10-05T06:18:00.000Z	dipnlik	Knelix	old pcs, they don't want to upgrade :(
2005-10-05T06:19:00.000Z	dipnlik	Knelix	only one pc on the network has a CD drive
2005-10-05T06:19:00.000Z	Knelix	dipnlik	I understand.
2005-10-05T06:19:00.000Z	dipnlik	Knelix	probably they don't want us bringing our own CDs with non-work stuff
2005-10-05T06:20:00.000Z	Knelix	dipnlik	Hmm. Have you talked to your boss about trying out Ubuntu.. Maybe he/she will be up to the idea and give you some tools to preview/install it.
2005-10-05T06:21:00.000Z	dipnlik	Knelix	told them last wek about it
2005-10-05T06:21:00.000Z	dipnlik	Knelix	week*
2005-10-05T06:21:00.000Z	Knelix	dipnlik	Naw, sorry I couldn't be of more help. Just throwing out possible ideas. I'm a newbie here too. :-)
2005-10-05T06:21:00.000Z	dipnlik	Knelix	they said "they would give me an answer on wednesday"
2005-10-05T06:22:00.000Z	Knelix	dipnlik	Nest Weds or the one that passed?
