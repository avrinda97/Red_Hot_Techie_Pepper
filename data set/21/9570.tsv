2005-09-01T10:55:00.000Z	Xinex		can someone help me diagnose this samba problem?
2005-09-01T10:56:00.000Z	redguy	Xinex	which is?
2005-09-01T10:58:00.000Z	redguy	Xinex	did it tell which parameter?
2005-09-01T10:59:00.000Z	redguy	Xinex	paste to ubuntu.pastebin.com your smb.conf and the log if you may
2005-09-01T11:01:00.000Z	Xinex	redguy	where is the smb.conf?
2005-09-01T11:01:00.000Z	redguy	Xinex	 /etc/samba/smb.conf
2005-09-01T11:06:00.000Z	redguy	Xinex	hmm, you sure it's not running?
2005-09-01T11:09:00.000Z	redguy	Xinex	stop the daemons
2005-09-01T11:10:00.000Z	redguy	Xinex	how did you start samba?
2005-09-01T11:10:00.000Z	redguy	Xinex	ah. ok :-)
2005-09-01T11:11:00.000Z	redguy	Xinex	so now killall smbd && killall nmbd
2005-09-01T11:12:00.000Z	redguy	Xinex	check if the processes are actually killed
2005-09-01T11:12:00.000Z	redguy	Xinex	you need printing in samba?
2005-09-01T11:13:00.000Z	redguy	Xinex	comment out [printers]  and [print$]  sections then
2005-09-01T11:14:00.000Z	redguy	Xinex	don't think so
2005-09-01T11:15:00.000Z	redguy	Xinex	after that, after making sure that smbd and nmbd aren't running, start samba with sudo invoke-rc.s samba start
2005-09-01T11:17:00.000Z	redguy	Xinex	try that after commenting out the printers
2005-09-01T11:20:00.000Z	redguy	Xinex	any luck with that?
2005-09-01T11:23:00.000Z	Xinex	redguy	wait, I'm transferring a file
2005-09-01T11:34:00.000Z	Xinex	redguy	invoke-rc.s not found
2005-09-01T11:38:00.000Z	redguy	Xinex	were cool?
