2007-09-17T11:05:00.000Z	tsm_ice9		anybody willing to share some insight on hardware choice?
2007-09-17T11:05:00.000Z	chowmeined	tsm_ice9	sure
2007-09-17T11:10:00.000Z	tsm_ice9	chowmeined	window resizing is a little choppy for me, now that you mention it
2007-09-17T11:11:00.000Z	tsm_ice9	chowmeined	however, I have a pretty minimal setup, I don't use much RAM or a very nice CPU
2007-09-17T11:16:00.000Z	tsm_ice9	chowmeined	you said you'd be up for giving a little hardware input-- I'm thinking about getting either a Dell lappy with feisty factory-installed, or an hp and doing the install myself.. is it worth it to get the un-supported hp and be on my own?
2007-09-17T11:16:00.000Z	chowmeined	tsm_ice9	it depends, does the HP have something you specifically want?
2007-09-17T11:16:00.000Z	tsm_ice9	chowmeined	basically, it's in a more compact form factor, that's about it...
2007-09-17T11:17:00.000Z	chowmeined	tsm_ice9	you'll want to make sure it has a supported wireless card
2007-09-17T11:18:00.000Z	tsm_ice9	chowmeined	I checked in the store and it has broadcom, which made me grimace, but it seems people on the forums have been able to kluge 'em into working
2007-09-17T11:18:00.000Z	chowmeined	tsm_ice9	yes, its possible to get them working.. but you really dont want a broadcom
2007-09-17T11:18:00.000Z	chowmeined	tsm_ice9	because getting them working is a pain.. and they dont work that well
2007-09-17T11:20:00.000Z	tsm_ice9	chowmeined	to be honest I'm also worried about returning the thing if it doesn't work out.. the people in store wouldn't let me try a live CD, so they might not be so tolerant
2007-09-17T11:20:00.000Z	chowmeined	tsm_ice9	you really dont want a broadcom
2007-09-17T11:21:00.000Z	tsm_ice9	chowmeined	hmm ok.. I didn't know just how bad broadcom would be... I suppose I can stick with the Dell
2007-09-17T11:22:00.000Z	chowmeined	tsm_ice9	there are more options than that.. you could try looking at another model/configuration of an HP
2007-09-17T11:22:00.000Z	chowmeined	tsm_ice9	you could also look at a ThinkPad
2007-09-17T11:22:00.000Z	tsm_ice9	chowmeined	yeah, I think most of them come with broadcom (HPs)
2007-09-17T11:23:00.000Z	tsm_ice9	chowmeined	I saw a thinkpad in store that looked nice, had intel for graphics and wireless.. but yeah they wouldn't let me try my live CD so I walked out
2007-09-17T11:23:00.000Z	chowmeined	tsm_ice9	intel graphics and wireless are good
2007-09-17T11:25:00.000Z	tsm_ice9	chowmeined	I was kind of hoping for a 12" but there's not much else in that price range
2007-09-17T11:32:00.000Z	tsm_ice9	chowmeined	thanks for the input, I appreciate it
