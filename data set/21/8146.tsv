2007-04-14T08:20:00.000Z	peepsalot		please, someone, interfaces
2007-04-14T08:20:00.000Z	firefly2442	peepsalot	what's your problem?
2007-04-14T08:20:00.000Z	peepsalot		!ubotu
2007-04-14T08:20:00.000Z	peepsalot		hi PepperoniDip
2007-04-14T08:20:00.000Z	peepsalot		i'm fine
2007-04-14T08:21:00.000Z	peepsalot	firefly2442	well, my interfaces file got cleared out and just has some nonsense comments in it
2007-04-14T08:21:00.000Z	firefly2442	peepsalot	ok, are you running wired ethernet or wireless or something else?
2007-04-14T08:22:00.000Z	peepsalot	firefly2442	wired, but I am using ndiswrapper because it is a USB to gigabit ethernet adapter
2007-04-14T08:22:00.000Z	peepsalot	firefly2442	do you think ndiswrapper clears the interfaces file automatically?
2007-04-14T08:22:00.000Z	firefly2442	peepsalot	ok, so it doesn't autodetect and configure it?
2007-04-14T08:23:00.000Z	firefly2442	peepsalot	I'm not sure, I've never used ndiswrapper but I wouldn't think so
2007-04-14T08:23:00.000Z	peepsalot	firefly2442	no, it doesn't auto-anything.  i've been trying since yesterday
2007-04-14T08:23:00.000Z	firefly2442	peepsalot	if you're missing a driver (module) then it won't work
2007-04-14T08:23:00.000Z	peepsalot	firefly2442	can you just humor me and pastebin your interfaces
2007-04-14T08:23:00.000Z	firefly2442	peepsalot	"lsmod" in the terminal will show you the loaded modules
2007-04-14T08:23:00.000Z	firefly2442	peepsalot	sure justa second

2007-04-14T08:26:00.000Z	peepsalot		thx firefly2442
2007-04-14T08:27:00.000Z	firefly2442	peepsalot	I have two wired ethernet connections, but in your case with the USB adapter, I'm not sure if it would be called eth0/1
