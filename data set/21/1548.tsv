2010-08-16T00:13:00.000Z	headkase314	hsr	for rhythmbox in synaptic search for "rhythmbox radio browser"
2010-08-16T00:13:00.000Z	headkase314	hsr	and don't forget to enable it in the plug-in settings of rhythmbox - it does shoutcast, icecast, etc.
2010-08-16T00:14:00.000Z	hsr	headkase314	Does it allow to download as well?
2010-08-16T00:14:00.000Z	headkase314	hsr	it allows you to record streams as they play
2010-08-16T00:16:00.000Z	hsr	headkase314	Well i listen to RadioParadise and SKY.fm using their links in m3u format... will it work?
2010-08-16T00:16:00.000Z	headkase314	hsr	rhythmbox radio browser is self-contained and only does radio - I do not believe but am not sure that you can point it at sky.fm
2010-08-16T00:17:00.000Z	hsr	headkase314	Is there a plugin like that for Amarok?
2010-08-16T00:17:00.000Z	headkase314	hsr	that specific plug-in is for rhythmbox I don't doubt that there is something similar for Amarok I just don't know what it would be.
2010-08-16T00:19:00.000Z	hsr	headkase314	Thanks a lot, i will be able to work it out myself then. If not atleast by seeing the code of that plugin and make one for amarok.. Thanks
2010-08-16T00:19:00.000Z	headkase314	hsr	you're welcome - good hunting.
2010-08-16T00:21:00.000Z	hsr	headkase314	Ryhthombox allows to point to any station using the url option, it allows to add url of station, thats sufficient. Using mp3/m3u/aac format anyone can find the url.. external radios can work
