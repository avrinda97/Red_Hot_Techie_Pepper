2009-01-25T11:39:00.000Z	mnguyen		How do I get bitchx to show up in apt? I already added universe to my sources.list
2009-01-25T11:39:00.000Z	prince_jammys	mnguyen	i thought bitchx was history
2009-01-25T11:40:00.000Z	mnguyen	prince_jammys	haven't used any flavor of linux for like a year... what's another good irc client i can run from the terminal?
2009-01-25T11:40:00.000Z	prince_jammys	mnguyen	i don't think bitchx exists any more
2009-01-25T11:40:00.000Z	prince_jammys	mnguyen	irssi
2009-01-25T11:40:00.000Z	mnguyen	prince_jammys	thanks
2009-01-25T11:41:00.000Z	mnguyen		cause I don't like xchat :)
2009-01-25T11:41:00.000Z	prince_jammys	mnguyen	irssi is pretty much the most popular cli client
2009-01-25T11:41:00.000Z	mnguyen	prince_jammys	thanks for the info
2009-01-25T11:41:00.000Z	mnguyen	prince_jammys	do you have a recommendation for a terminal emulator?
2009-01-25T11:42:00.000Z	prince_jammys	mnguyen	i use konsole and xterm.
2009-01-25T11:42:00.000Z	mnguyen	prince_jammys	kubuntu?
2009-01-25T11:42:00.000Z	prince_jammys	mnguyen	rxvt or urxvt is good also.
2009-01-25T11:42:00.000Z	prince_jammys	mnguyen	originally kubuntu, but now i run fluxbox. i do have some kde apps, though
2009-01-25T11:44:00.000Z	mnguyen	prince_jammys	yeah i decided to install openbox; i'm simply leveraging ubuntu's repositories :)
2009-01-25T11:44:00.000Z	prince_jammys	mnguyen	heh. well, konsole suits me fine ... slow to start up, like many kde apps. but pretty nice otherwise
2009-01-25T11:45:00.000Z	mnguyen	prince_jammys	thanks i'll give rxvt or urxvt a try
2009-01-25T11:45:00.000Z	prince_jammys	mnguyen	those are lighter
2009-01-25T11:45:00.000Z	mnguyen	prince_jammys	do either of them have tabs?
2009-01-25T11:46:00.000Z	prince_jammys	mnguyen	i don't remember. you may want something like konsole (or gnome-terminal) for that
2009-01-25T11:46:00.000Z	prince_jammys	mnguyen	i run everything inside of 'screen' so i don't use tabs
