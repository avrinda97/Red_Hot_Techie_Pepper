2009-11-23T19:05:00.000Z	dipsh		i installed to a USB Pen drive and now grub is messed up on my hard disk
2009-11-23T19:06:00.000Z	dipsh		how can i easily fix that?
2009-11-23T19:06:00.000Z	dipsh		i tried sudo grub-install /dev/sda and it said...
2009-11-23T19:06:00.000Z	dipsh		not a block device
2009-11-23T19:07:00.000Z	dipsh		anyone good with grub??
2009-11-23T19:08:00.000Z	dipsh		it times out and goes to sleep automatically
2009-11-23T19:09:00.000Z	dipsh		but i dont care about that now, the old systems that i had on the machine were windows/7.10 and i need them for work
2009-11-23T19:09:00.000Z	dipsh		the bootloader is dead now
2009-11-23T19:10:00.000Z	dipsh		i installed to a USB pen to test out 9.10, but it installed the bootloader for ALL systems on the PEN!!
2009-11-23T19:11:00.000Z	dipsh		how can i restore my boot loader?
2009-11-23T19:12:00.000Z	Reactor	dipsh	boot from cd and select that option
2009-11-23T19:13:00.000Z	Reactor	dipsh	but idk where it is
2009-11-23T19:13:00.000Z	dipsh	Reactor	there is an option to re-install grub?
2009-11-23T19:13:00.000Z	dipsh	Reactor	i found one to boot from hard disk
2009-11-23T19:13:00.000Z	Reactor	dipsh	I am not sure
2009-11-23T19:14:00.000Z	dipsh		hmmm... let me boot from the old system and try and re-install grub
2009-11-23T19:14:00.000Z	dipsh		i did, but i am not an expert so some things are confusing
2009-11-23T19:14:00.000Z	dipsh		according to the info it could be "sudo grub-install /dev/sda"
2009-11-23T19:14:00.000Z	Reactor	dipsh	I can't remember - probably there's one
2009-11-23T19:14:00.000Z	Reactor	dipsh	yh yh
2009-11-23T19:15:00.000Z	Reactor	dipsh	boot live and try tht
