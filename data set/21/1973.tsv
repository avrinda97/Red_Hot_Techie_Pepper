2011-01-04T04:28:00.000Z	GeekSquid	Paatus	I really like vpostmaster for setting up mail servers, makes useradmin and domain managment easy ... sendmail will sendmail regardless but there are so many differnet levels of mail that without a better idea of what this is used for it is a little difficult to point you in the right direction
