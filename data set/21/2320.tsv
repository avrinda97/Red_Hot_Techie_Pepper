2009-11-14T07:31:00.000Z	mrXX	bastid_raZor	my bad, thanks dude , gr8 help
2009-11-14T07:32:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	mrXX	any folders in /var/www need this same permission set if you want others to view it.
2009-11-14T07:33:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	mrXX	and the files you host also need that same permission set.
2009-11-14T07:34:00.000Z	mrXX	bastid_raZor	but now i cant see the index page on the browser, it says permission denied!
2009-11-14T07:35:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	mrXX	set the permissions the same as /var/www
2009-11-14T07:35:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	mrXX	i'm actually wrong on files. the files just need read permission for the group.
