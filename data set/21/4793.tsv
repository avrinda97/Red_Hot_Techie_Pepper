2008-11-06T10:32:00.000Z	Rev		im looking for an image viewer that would allow me to delete pictures, any ideas?
2008-11-06T10:33:00.000Z	SegFaultAX	Rev	define a 'real' viewer
2008-11-06T10:42:00.000Z	SegFaultAX	Rev	if the pictures are really large, that is to say if they are high resolution, then that could slow their load down substantially
2008-11-06T10:43:00.000Z	SegFaultAX	Rev	whats the bit depth?
2008-11-06T10:44:00.000Z	SegFaultAX	Rev	keep in mind that scaling a few million bytes (several megs) of data can take some time. thats why image viewers generally produce thumbnails
2008-11-06T10:45:00.000Z	Rev	SegFaultAX	yeah yeah, i dont argue about that. THats just that i used to use an other viewer, but i cant remeber the name since i installed a fresh ibex. It was far faster that the EoG. It was a little like Feh in term of speed but with a GUI
2008-11-06T10:46:00.000Z	SegFaultAX	Rev	try a search in the repository, you might get lucky or find an acceptable alternative
2008-11-06T10:46:00.000Z	Rev	SegFaultAX	ok thanls
2008-11-06T10:47:00.000Z	SegFaultAX	Rev	also, http://www.getdeb.net/
2008-11-06T10:49:00.000Z	Rev	SegFaultAX	elpargo , ahhhh i just tried gthumb, its really better
2008-11-06T10:49:00.000Z	SegFaultAX	Rev	nice, you should still take a look at that site: http://www.getdeb.net/
2008-11-06T10:51:00.000Z	Rev	SegFaultAX	thanks to getdeb, i found back my viewer ;)
2008-11-06T10:51:00.000Z	SegFaultAX	Rev	told ya :D
2008-11-06T10:51:00.000Z	SegFaultAX	Rev	its likely still compatible, give it a shot
2008-11-06T10:51:00.000Z	Rev	SegFaultAX	not yet available for Intrepid i think ... thanks for the getdeb tip anyway, i'll use it again thats for sure ! ;)
2008-11-06T10:53:00.000Z	Rev	SegFaultAX	is it possible to request a .deb to be built?
2008-11-06T10:53:00.000Z	Rev	SegFaultAX	somewhere i mean?
2008-11-06T10:54:00.000Z	SegFaultAX	Rev	contact the developers. its probably already in the process though. plus devs and package maintainers are slow
2008-11-06T10:55:00.000Z	SegFaultAX	Rev	its only been a week afterall, give them a chance to stretch their legs :D
2008-11-06T10:55:00.000Z	Rev	SegFaultAX	ok, i'll just note it into my tomboy, and i'll check again in some weeks ;)
2008-11-06T10:55:00.000Z	Rev	SegFaultAX	thanks for all your help
