2011-12-01T15:11:00.000Z	KrisDouglas	mrgotty	By "dropping to the command line" he means recovery console.
2011-12-01T15:12:00.000Z	KrisDouglas	mrgotty	you can download recovery disks
2011-12-01T15:12:00.000Z	KrisDouglas	mrgotty	have a look for FalconFour's ultimate boot CD, that has a windows 7 recovery kit on it.
2011-12-01T15:13:00.000Z	KrisDouglas	mrgotty	see my message.

2011-12-01T15:28:00.000Z	mrgotty	KrisDouglas	so how do I put this on USB and make sure it boots from USB?
2011-12-01T15:29:00.000Z	KrisDouglas	mrgotty	It's a bit tricky to boot it from USB
2011-12-01T15:29:00.000Z	KrisDouglas	mrgotty	the windows recovery system isn't compatible with what dr_willis said.
2011-12-01T15:30:00.000Z	KrisDouglas	mrgotty	there is a readme file in the archive for once it's downloaded.
2011-12-01T17:02:00.000Z	mrgotty	KrisDouglas	how do i use that boot prog as a recovery disk?
