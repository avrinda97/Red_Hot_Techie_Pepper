2005-12-19T12:05:00.000Z	LabThug		How do you get Breezy to install on a Dell GX280 with an SATA drive?
2005-12-19T12:07:00.000Z	LabThug		I tried default first, and expert as well, both hang at the same point
2005-12-19T12:07:00.000Z	sethk	LabThug	then it ran fine
2005-12-19T12:06:00.000Z	sethk	LabThug	the main trick is that the hard drives are sda/b rather than hda/b
2005-12-19T12:06:00.000Z	sethk	LabThug	what are you seeing?
2005-12-19T12:06:00.000Z	LabThug	sethk	it hangs when going into the partitioning mode
2005-12-19T12:06:00.000Z	sethk	LabThug	are you in expert mode or default mode?
2005-12-19T12:07:00.000Z	sethk	LabThug	on one dell (which wasn't exactly the same model as yours) I had to stop the SATA module from loading during install
2005-12-19T12:07:00.000Z	LabThug	sethk	tell me more :-D
2005-12-19T12:07:00.000Z	sethk	LabThug	it then used hda/b etc.  then I had to boot a rescue cd, edit fstab, and change hda to sda, hdb to sdb, etc.
2005-12-19T12:08:00.000Z	sethk	LabThug	let me check which sata that thing uses.  hold on a moment
2005-12-19T12:08:00.000Z	sethk	LabThug	yes, once I figured this part out (which took a long time, as you might imagine) everything went smoothly
2005-12-19T12:09:00.000Z	LabThug	sethk	cool.  thanks for the info
2005-12-19T12:09:00.000Z	sethk	LabThug	this one is using the Intel ICH6M sata 9aka 82801fbm)
2005-12-19T12:10:00.000Z	sethk	LabThug	another solution is to partition first with another distro, then install ubuntu and tell it to use the existing partitions
2005-12-19T12:10:00.000Z	sethk	LabThug	but this doesn't always work in this situation, because you still need to list the partitions and tell it which ones to use
2005-12-19T12:10:00.000Z	sethk	LabThug	and that still might fail.  But it did work for me once.
2005-12-19T12:11:00.000Z	sethk	LabThug	you can gather info by using the distro cd to boot into a shell and running the hardware detection program on the command line.
2005-12-19T12:11:00.000Z	sethk	LabThug	that shows you udev designations for the hard drives, which map to hda/sda/whatever, but the mapping is a bit arcane
2005-12-19T12:12:00.000Z	LabThug	sethk	I do appreciate your help,  thanks much
2005-12-19T12:12:00.000Z	sethk	LabThug	hope it works out for you.
