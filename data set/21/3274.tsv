2009-03-25T04:27:00.000Z	g4lt-lappy	dannyboy79	hmm, sounds like your keyboard's not working too hot.
2009-03-25T04:27:00.000Z	dannyboy79	g4lt-lappy	it doesn't work over ssh either.
2009-03-25T04:28:00.000Z	dannyboy79	g4lt-lappy	the only reason I don't suspect the keyboard is because it doesn't work over ssh.

2009-03-25T04:28:00.000Z	dannyboy79	g4lt-lappy	i meant just "putty" sshing into my box
2009-03-25T04:29:00.000Z	g4lt-lappy	dannyboy79	it sickens me to say thins, but when's the last time you rebooted?
2009-03-25T04:29:00.000Z	dannyboy79	g4lt-lappy	uptime shows 19:29:39 up 28 days,  9:03,  3 users,  load average: 4.31, 4.00, 2.82

2009-03-25T04:30:00.000Z	g4lt-lappy	dannyboy79	two issues, that 4.7 load may slow down your keyboard, and second, did you just update the kerel?
2009-03-25T04:32:00.000Z	dannyboy79	g4lt-lappy	4.7 load is because of using makedvd -burn from tovid an no I didn't just install new kernel. still using  2.6.20-17-generic
2009-03-25T04:32:00.000Z	g4lt-lappy	dannyboy79	anything change before your keyboard went wonky?
2009-03-25T04:34:00.000Z	dannyboy79	g4lt-lappy	not that I am aware of. I don't even get updates anymore because I am still using Feisty.
2009-03-25T04:34:00.000Z	dannyboy79	g4lt-lappy	i gotta go, thanks for trying to help.
