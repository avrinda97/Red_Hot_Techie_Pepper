2010-08-16T07:19:00.000Z	cobelloy		hi how do I configure xserver in ubuntu/gnome?
2010-08-16T07:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cobelloy	What are you trying to configure specifically?
2010-08-16T07:20:00.000Z	cobelloy	Jordan_U	I dont have an xorg.conf file that I can edit, and I dont think i am using correct intel driver
2010-08-16T07:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cobelloy	Xorg is pretty smart now and while you can still create an Xorg.conf manually and it will be used, I doubt that is the problem. The only likely issue with choosing a driver would be KMS vs non KMS, which is actually not an Xorg configuration.
2010-08-16T07:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cobelloy	What problem are you having specifically with the default setup?
2010-08-16T07:23:00.000Z	cobelloy	Jordan_U	i dont know what kms is, the crux of the problem is that there is no 3d acceleration at the moment
2010-08-16T07:23:00.000Z	cobelloy	Jordan_U	lspci -v says driver is i915, but have 945 chip
2010-08-16T07:29:00.000Z	cobelloy	Jordan_U	can u suggest anything? how can I turn off X and get console to do a dpkg-reconfigure?
2010-08-16T07:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cobelloy	Can you pastebin your /var/log/Xorg.0.log ?
2010-08-16T07:32:00.000Z	cobelloy	Jordan_U	http://pastebin.com/eGpBxnVb
2010-08-16T07:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cobelloy	Can you pastebin the output of "glxinfo"?
2010-08-16T07:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cobelloy	It appears that Xorg is at least trying to load the "intel" driver, which is the correct driver for a 945G.

2010-08-16T07:40:00.000Z	cobelloy	Jordan_U	why does it identify as i915 tho when 945G is one of the listed chips?
2010-08-16T07:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cobelloy	"direct rendering: Yes" Means you have 3D acceleration.
2010-08-16T07:40:00.000Z	cobelloy	Jordan_U	is there an easy way to check its working?
2010-08-16T07:46:00.000Z	cobelloy	Jordan_U	glxgears gets around 4000 frames/5sec - is that good or bad performance?
2010-08-16T07:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cobelloy	That's fast enough to suggest you have 3D acceleration, beyond that glxgears is a poor benchmark
2010-08-16T07:47:00.000Z	cobelloy	Jordan_U	is there a better test?
2010-08-16T07:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cobelloy	All intel cards use the "i915" kernel driver.
2010-08-16T07:48:00.000Z	cobelloy	Jordan_U	thanks, I will try to change the memory allocation of the chip that might improve performance
