2010-02-05T03:51:00.000Z	Viking667		I've got modules loaded for my sound, but alsa still insists there are no soundcards.
2010-02-05T03:51:00.000Z	Viking667		even when the command "alsa reload" unloaded all the sound modules, then reloaded the exact same ones....
2010-02-05T03:52:00.000Z	Viking667		So... what the heck am I missing?
2010-02-05T03:52:00.000Z	loops	Viking667	 what does dmesg say?
2010-02-05T03:52:00.000Z	Viking667		finds that the ES1371 is there, as well as the on board AC97
2010-02-05T03:52:00.000Z	Viking667		snd_via82xx
2010-02-05T03:53:00.000Z	Viking667		I even hear clicks when I modprobe the es1371
2010-02-05T03:53:00.000Z	loops	Viking667	what are you seeing that suggests alsa isn't seeing the cards ?
2010-02-05T03:54:00.000Z	Viking667		alsactl store; alsactl: load-state(1608):   no soundcards found
2010-02-05T03:54:00.000Z	Viking667		do I have to nuke asound.ctl and restart alsa?
2010-02-05T03:55:00.000Z	loops	Viking667	perhaps; worth a shot
2010-02-05T03:56:00.000Z	Viking667		hm. Didn't work. Alsamixer still insists there's no such device (default)
2010-02-05T03:58:00.000Z	Viking667		Weird thing is: I've got sound devices in /dev and even a couple of control devices in /dev/snd/
2010-02-05T03:58:00.000Z	Viking667		... that point to two control devices in dev
2010-02-05T03:59:00.000Z	Viking667	hyperstation	weren't talking about you.. more what archboxman said
2010-02-05T03:59:00.000Z	loops	Viking667	you don't have a buggered ~/.asoundrc do you
2010-02-05T03:59:00.000Z	Viking667		hm. Could do. I never thought of that, as I didn't know it existed until now.
2010-02-05T03:59:00.000Z	loops	Viking667	you probably don't have one then
2010-02-05T04:01:00.000Z	Viking667		urk.
2010-02-05T04:01:00.000Z	Viking667		wrong damn machine.
2010-02-05T04:01:00.000Z	loops	Viking667	lol.
