2011-04-30T01:14:00.000Z	truepurple	KrisDouglas	Well, I was having trouble with my video card drivers before updating even, I had a corrupted driver I couldn't remove, and was not sure what driver to use
2011-04-30T01:15:00.000Z	truepurple	KrisDouglas	What is ssh?
2011-04-30T01:16:00.000Z	KrisDouglas	truepurple	its remote shell (like remote desktop but it gives you a terminal.) sadly, if you don't know what that is, its likely to not be installed, and thus your install could be hosed.
2011-04-30T01:16:00.000Z	KrisDouglas	truepurple	In fact there is one option
2011-04-30T01:17:00.000Z	KrisDouglas	truepurple	http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/grub-boot-into-single-user-mode/
2011-04-30T01:18:00.000Z	truepurple	KrisDouglas	I never get to a grub screen though
2011-04-30T01:20:00.000Z	KrisDouglas	truepurple	worth a try
2011-04-30T01:22:00.000Z	truepurple	KrisDouglas	It says "It seems you do not have the hardware required to run unity. Please choose ubuntu classic at the login screen and you will be using the traditional environment"
2011-04-30T01:22:00.000Z	KrisDouglas	truepurple	accept that message, that's fine.
2011-04-30T01:23:00.000Z	truepurple	KrisDouglas	It didn't give me a option to choose ubuntu classic, but I loaded into a desktop, now I will see what happens if I restart
2011-04-30T01:23:00.000Z	KrisDouglas	truepurple	i would recommend installing the latest nvidia driver from the guides on the Ubuntu wiki
2011-04-30T01:24:00.000Z	truepurple	KrisDouglas	I have only one mouse to swap between these PCs, is there a hotkey for restarting?
2011-04-30T01:24:00.000Z	truepurple	KrisDouglas	Except I am using a ATI radeon 6850
2011-04-30T01:24:00.000Z	truepurple	KrisDouglas	You would recommend nvadia drivers for a ATI card?
2011-04-30T01:24:00.000Z	KrisDouglas	truepurple	sorry, assumed you were on NV
2011-04-30T01:25:00.000Z	KrisDouglas	truepurple	the same guide is available for ATI
2011-04-30T01:26:00.000Z	truepurple	KrisDouglas	You think a driver update could fix this problem?
2011-04-30T01:26:00.000Z	KrisDouglas	truepurple	certainly so.
2011-04-30T01:27:00.000Z	truepurple	KrisDouglas	How do I remove the corrupt old driver then? Could we please speak in PM? Less work keeping track of the conversation
2011-04-30T01:28:00.000Z	KrisDouglas	truepurple	see pm
