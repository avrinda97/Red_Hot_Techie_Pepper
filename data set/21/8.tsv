2004-11-18T16:23:00.000Z	borgmeister		ok, after i have had my hard drive replaced on my desktop,\ill transfer the files to that machine, and then reinstall
2004-11-18T16:24:00.000Z	borgmeister		i know
2004-11-18T16:24:00.000Z	borgmeister		hehe
2004-11-18T16:24:00.000Z	mdz	borgmeister	there's nothing particularly drastic in hoary at the moment
2004-11-18T16:25:00.000Z	mdz	borgmeister	what went wrong?
2004-11-18T16:25:00.000Z	borgmeister	mdz	sound in totem
2004-11-18T16:26:00.000Z	mdz	borgmeister	you said that was already broken before you upgraded
2004-11-18T16:27:00.000Z	mdz	borgmeister	sound works in other applications, only totem is a problem?
2004-11-18T16:28:00.000Z	mdz	borgmeister	does sound work at all, in any program?
2004-11-18T16:28:00.000Z	mdz	borgmeister	the avi's worked in what program?
2004-11-18T16:30:00.000Z	mdz	borgmeister	I'm afraid I don't understand.  It was working before, and now it isn't.  What did you change?
2004-11-18T16:31:00.000Z	mdz	borgmeister	you already said that it was broken already before you upgraded to hoary
2004-11-18T16:33:00.000Z	mdz	borgmeister	reinstalling sounds like a good step at this point; you should stay away from hoary until you're more familiar with the system
2004-11-18T16:34:00.000Z	mdz	borgmeister	if your sound doesn't work in a fresh install, with everything default, let us know
