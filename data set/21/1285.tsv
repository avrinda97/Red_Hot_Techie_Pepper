2011-04-06T11:31:00.000Z	cache_surplus		are you attacking me?
2011-04-06T11:31:00.000Z	cache_surplus		lolol
2011-04-06T11:31:00.000Z	cache_surplus		hahahahaha
2011-04-06T11:31:00.000Z	cache_surplus		funny guy
2011-04-06T11:31:00.000Z	cache_surplus		but i like that
2011-04-06T11:31:00.000Z	cache_surplus		i need a good laugh now and then
2011-04-06T11:33:00.000Z	cache_surplus		what was the point of kicking me? who is your superior? who gave you irc admin rights? that was uncalled for big time...
2011-04-06T11:34:00.000Z	cache_surplus		your advice is not sound
2011-04-06T11:35:00.000Z	cache_surplus		can someone else help out?
2011-04-06T11:35:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	cache_surplus	his advice is sound
2011-04-06T11:35:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	cache_surplus	if you are running older or odd hardware it might just not work
2011-04-06T11:36:00.000Z	cache_surplus	noisewaterphd	possibly ... ill didnt say i wasnt going to try it,,, i said my options are limited,,, and would try another option if there is one,,, usually there is if you have used linux for any length of time...
2011-04-06T11:38:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	cache_surplus	are you trying to say that I am new to linux? thats why you are getting kicked. you cant even install ubuntu, and then you come on irc and ignore the advice of folks that have been building and using linux since before you could talk. so take the advice or go elsewhere
2011-04-06T11:46:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	cache_surplus	can you burn another dvd? if so perhaps try installing 10.04, and then upgrade to 10.10 over net
2011-04-06T11:52:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	cache_surplus	ya, thats a fairly old notebook. I wouldn't be surprised if the 10.10 installer maybe just won't go. If all else fails, go back a few versions and do the net upgrades. Thats worked well for me when helping friends/family with older equipment. the 2100 isnt 'that' old, but it could be the case.
2011-04-06T12:17:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	cache_surplus	that drive either doesn't like those disks, or the drive could be dirty
2011-04-06T12:20:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	cache_surplus	do you have a usb thumb drive you could use to create the installer?
2011-04-06T12:23:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	cache_surplus	^^
2011-04-06T12:26:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	cache_surplus	if you aren't actually going to use the multi distro features and such, a simple netboot is quicker and easier
2011-04-06T12:26:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	cache_surplus	however PXE is pretty sweet
