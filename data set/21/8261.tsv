2007-03-18T09:13:00.000Z	Steve^		I've installed all the mysql stuff, apache, php, but I can't get to my mysql server.. isn't there something to test mysql is actually there?
2007-03-18T09:14:00.000Z	ikonia	Steve^	mysql is the client command
2007-03-18T09:14:00.000Z	Steve^	ikonia	ok, that doesn't work
2007-03-18T09:16:00.000Z	ikonia	Steve^	start up mysql server
2007-03-18T09:16:00.000Z	ikonia	Steve^	use the init script - it should be started at install time
2007-03-18T09:17:00.000Z	ikonia	Steve^	you just need to "apt-get install mysql-server"
2007-03-18T09:17:00.000Z	ikonia	Steve^	no guide needed, or use synaptic to find the packages
2007-03-18T09:20:00.000Z	Steve^	ikonia	thanks, but why doesn't the guide say that? :/
2007-03-18T09:21:00.000Z	ikonia	Steve^	poor guide
2010-08-07T22:00:00.000Z	ikonia	Steve^	what do you mean, add a dns wildcard
2010-08-07T22:01:00.000Z	Steve^	ikonia	a wildcard subdomain, for a wordpress installation
2010-08-07T22:01:00.000Z	ikonia	Steve^	you need to edit the dns servers that host your domain then
2010-08-07T22:01:00.000Z	Steve^	ikonia	I'm doing it locally
2010-08-07T22:01:00.000Z	ikonia	Steve^	then you need to edit your dns servers
2010-08-07T22:01:00.000Z	Steve^	ikonia	which brings me back to my original question
2010-08-07T22:02:00.000Z	ikonia	Steve^	what dns servers are you running ?
2010-08-07T22:02:00.000Z	Steve^	ikonia	whatever comes preinstalled
2010-08-07T22:02:00.000Z	ikonia	Steve^	none
2010-08-07T22:03:00.000Z	Steve^	ikonia	what would you recommend I install?
2010-08-07T22:03:00.000Z	ikonia	Steve^	I recommend you don't use a sub domain if you're just testing wordpress
2010-08-07T22:04:00.000Z	ikonia	Steve^	I recommend just having a fake domain in your host file and using that to test your wordpress install before go live
