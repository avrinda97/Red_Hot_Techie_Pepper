2008-10-04T21:40:00.000Z	RickZilla		Any way to give myself access to any folder I want to?
2008-10-04T21:40:00.000Z	RickZilla		Or do I always have to do it via terminal?

2008-10-04T21:56:00.000Z	RickZilla		Using terminal, how can I move a file to a folder?  sudo cp gives me an error, and I suspect it's because the file doesn't already exist in the destination folder
2008-10-04T21:56:00.000Z	RickZilla		Or a better question...what's the correct syntax for a file located on my desktop?
2008-10-04T21:57:00.000Z	RickZilla		ok, thanks
2008-10-04T21:57:00.000Z	Rhorse	RickZilla	sudo cp /path/to/file path/to/destination/directory
2008-10-04T21:58:00.000Z	RickZilla	Rhorse	 I'm doing it that way, but it's telling me that path doesn't exist
2008-10-04T21:59:00.000Z	Rhorse	RickZilla	then it *doesn't find the path and type that instead
2008-10-04T21:59:00.000Z	RickZilla	Rhorse	 not sure what you mean
2008-10-04T21:59:00.000Z	RickZilla		type what instead?
2008-10-04T21:59:00.000Z	Rhorse	RickZilla	you are not correctly typing the path.  You can use /home/Desktop/file for source and what is the destination?
2008-10-04T22:00:00.000Z	RickZilla		etc/modprobe.d
2008-10-04T22:00:00.000Z	Rhorse	RickZilla	sri, /home/me/Desktop
2008-10-04T22:01:00.000Z	Rhorse	RickZilla	ok so it's sudo cp /home/me/Desktop /etc/modprobe. Don't forget the leading slash with /etc
2008-10-04T22:01:00.000Z	RickZilla	Rhorse	 Thanks, I'll try that
2008-10-04T22:01:00.000Z	Rhorse		Sri agn, /home/me/Desktop/FILE /etc/modprobe
2008-10-04T22:03:00.000Z	RickZilla	Rhorse	 That did it, thanks so much for the help...still trying to troubleshoot soundcard issues, so that's a piece of the puzzle
2008-10-04T22:03:00.000Z	RickZilla		Going to reboot and see what happens
