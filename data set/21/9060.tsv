2006-01-08T13:26:00.000Z	odat		quick question
2006-01-08T13:26:00.000Z	odat		if i had to pick between 386 and 686 kernel  what the hell would be the benefit?
2006-01-08T13:27:00.000Z	polpak	odat	one kernel is specifically optimized for higher end intel compatible processors
2006-01-08T16:49:00.000Z	odat	polpak	 system , preferences, keyboard shortcuts
2006-01-08T16:50:00.000Z	polpak	odat	that won't fix the synaptic problem though...
2006-01-08T16:51:00.000Z	odat	polpak	he said he is not getting the password box when you starts synaptic  thats gdm
2006-01-08T16:52:00.000Z	polpak	odat	is it? I thought it was gksudo
2006-01-10T14:00:00.000Z	polpak	odat	no you don't
2006-01-10T14:00:00.000Z	polpak	odat	but that's not what his problem is
2006-01-10T14:00:00.000Z	odat	polpak	doesn't he want the option to select kde over gnome when his girlfriend is on
2006-01-10T14:00:00.000Z	polpak	odat	yes, but he has that afaik
2006-01-10T14:01:00.000Z	polpak	odat	he wants to stop the grub prompt
2006-01-10T14:01:00.000Z	odat	polpak	ahhhh k thats what i get for coming in the conversation late lol
2006-01-10T14:01:00.000Z	polpak	odat	which is why he needs to edit /boot/grub/menu.lst
2006-01-10T14:56:00.000Z	odat	polpak	whats up?
2006-01-10T14:58:00.000Z	polpak	odat	I think you just point fsck at the device and it goes
2006-01-10T14:58:00.000Z	polpak	odat	fsck /dev/hda1 for example
2006-01-10T14:58:00.000Z	polpak	odat	but you have to know the device and partition number
2006-01-10T14:58:00.000Z	odat	polpak	how do i check?
2006-01-14T15:30:00.000Z	polpak	odat	paying for software isn't a "bad thing". Paying for software you can't fix/update/make changes to is.
2006-01-14T15:32:00.000Z	odat	polpak	I have no problem paying for software but i'm not paying the developers money to pay for the rights to right software for a platform they could have written to for free
