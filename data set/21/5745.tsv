2007-08-24T15:15:00.000Z	mcrandello	benn92647	now look for the items in the first tab that have (universe) and (multiverse) listed next to them, check mark them and you're all set. easy peasy

2007-08-24T15:24:00.000Z	mcrandello	benn92647	whichever you're more comfortable with, they both use the same dependency database
2007-08-24T15:25:00.000Z	benn92647	mcrandello	thank you..and thanks for having a little sense of humor:-P
2007-08-24T15:25:00.000Z	mcrandello	benn92647	only thing is you can't use more than one at once, which can be frustrating if you have multiple desktops open
2007-08-24T15:25:00.000Z	mcrandello	benn92647	np :)
2007-08-24T15:26:00.000Z	benn92647	mcrandello	just having the same issue I have had with linux since day one...flashplayer works as long as I dont ever close my desktop  as soon as I do it goes back to not working
2007-08-24T15:27:00.000Z	mcrandello	benn92647	that's really odd, this the flash plugin in firefox?
2007-08-24T15:27:00.000Z	benn92647	mcrandello	opera had itworking the longest..firefox works forabout an hour ot until i close it
2007-08-24T15:28:00.000Z	mcrandello	benn92647	does it make you download it again or does it just sit there and not do anything?
2007-08-24T15:30:00.000Z	benn92647	mcrandello	no it just wont play sound, but rythmbox works and most movies do to..so its something to do with firefox losing the directions to the sound output?
2007-08-24T15:33:00.000Z	benn92647	mcrandello	unfortunately because of that as soon as i can get windows vista I am probably going to dumb linux..right now linux sees my wireless network and nothing I do in windows seems to get it to work.
2007-08-24T15:33:00.000Z	mcrandello	benn92647	I found something that indicates you may need to install some devel files http://linux.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=201501&cid=16499733
2007-08-24T15:34:00.000Z	mcrandello	benn92647	that is a strange strange problem though
2007-08-24T15:35:00.000Z	benn92647	mcrandello	yeah between me nickrud,pelo and indygunfreak we finally had it going for a day
