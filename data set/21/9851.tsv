2005-07-02T14:59:00.000Z	nikkia		david, it would still be pointless to invest in security doors if you're not going to tag everything
2005-07-02T15:00:00.000Z	nikkia		david, it'd be easier to build something that detects the magnetic field, and check it when you walk in
2005-07-02T15:00:00.000Z	nikkia		throwing something thru the doors is likely to get you in trouble either way
2005-07-02T15:01:00.000Z	nikkia		david, even if they don't get you with shoplifting (if you havent' left the store with the item) they can     proobbaly get you with vandelism or destruction of private property
2005-07-02T15:02:00.000Z	nikkia		its a store, not colditz
2005-07-02T15:03:00.000Z	nikkia		jesse, they probably have light a donut shape, and the upper extent of the field is higher than you think
2005-07-02T15:03:00.000Z	nikkia		s/light/like/
2005-07-02T15:03:00.000Z	nikkia		the easiest way is just to make a bag that acts as a faraday cage :P
2005-07-02T15:04:00.000Z	nikkia		unfortunately, your bag is probably going to set off the sensors too :P
2005-07-02T15:04:00.000Z	merc	nikkia	i saw a cops episode where some people just lined the bag with tinfoil and loaded it up and walked out
2005-07-02T15:04:00.000Z	nikkia	merc	yeah, that'd be a faraday cage
2005-07-02T15:04:00.000Z	nikkia		the bottom line is, most stores don't check anyway
2005-07-02T15:04:00.000Z	merc	nikkia	hence the mention ;)
2005-07-02T15:05:00.000Z	nikkia		i often set off the sensors at our local supermarket when i buy a DVD...
2005-07-02T15:05:00.000Z	nikkia		they usually just look at me and wave me thru regardless
2005-07-02T15:05:00.000Z	nikkia		the key is probably a 'oh god, what have i done?' expression
2005-07-02T15:05:00.000Z	merc		my sister bought some clothes, and it had that tag on it still, i asked if the alarm went off she said 'yeah, but i just kept walking'
2005-07-02T15:06:00.000Z	nikkia		razor blades routinely set off those sensors too
2005-07-02T15:06:00.000Z	merc		question is, who carries razor blades while shopping?
2005-07-02T15:06:00.000Z	merc		good call
2005-07-02T15:06:00.000Z	nikkia	merc	people that buy the razor blades in the shop ?
