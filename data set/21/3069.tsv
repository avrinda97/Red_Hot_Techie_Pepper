2009-04-16T07:50:00.000Z	mmmyummytreats		aaaanyone able to help me out? I can't active the broadcom b43 legacy driver (it just sits and hangs and gives up) on my laptop even after installing the proprietary firmware :( :( (:
2009-04-16T07:50:00.000Z	ULFfuntu	mmmyummytreats	has the nic ever worked properly before?
2009-04-16T07:51:00.000Z	ULFfuntu	mmmyummytreats	ok good ... lemme think
2009-04-16T07:52:00.000Z	ULFfuntu	mmmyummytreats	just for the heck of it try another livecd.. another distro... verify that it doesn't hang with that
2009-04-16T07:53:00.000Z	ULFfuntu	mmmyummytreats	bc nics should work fine
2009-04-16T07:54:00.000Z	ULFfuntu	mmmyummytreats	well ok... have you tried reinstall?
2009-04-16T07:55:00.000Z	ULFfuntu	mmmyummytreats	lemme think abit
2009-04-16T07:55:00.000Z	ULFfuntu	mmmyummytreats	what happens exactly
2009-04-16T08:01:00.000Z	mmmyummytreats	ULFfuntu	i've been waiting literally this whole time to reproduce what happens but my hardware drivers window is taking literally five minutes to do "searching for available drivers..."
2009-04-16T08:02:00.000Z	ULFfuntu	mmmyummytreats	ok if you do a: lsmod | grep BCM(whatever) what happens
2009-04-16T08:04:00.000Z	ULFfuntu	mmmyummytreats	ok, if you just do an lsmod and look for a bcm...
2009-04-16T08:06:00.000Z	ULFfuntu	mmmyummytreats	ok good
2009-04-16T08:07:00.000Z	ULFfuntu	mmmyummytreats	ok verify what is the chipset on this wireless nic for sure
2009-04-16T08:08:00.000Z	mmmyummytreats	ULFfuntu	how specifically do i do that? i'm sorry.
2009-04-16T08:09:00.000Z	ULFfuntu	mmmyummytreats	ok this nic for sure is BCM(whatever)
2009-04-16T08:09:00.000Z	ULFfuntu	mmmyummytreats	because BCM is very solid in linux IMHO
2009-04-16T08:09:00.000Z	mmmyummytreats	ULFfuntu	i can paste (or whatever pasting thing you guys do here) my lspci if you want
2009-04-16T08:09:00.000Z	ULFfuntu	mmmyummytreats	sure
2009-04-16T08:16:00.000Z	ULFfuntu	mmmyummytreats	my gut feeling is that not all the vegetables are loading up...
2009-04-16T08:16:00.000Z	ULFfuntu	mmmyummytreats	go to lib folder and tell me when you are there
2009-04-16T08:18:00.000Z	ULFfuntu	mmmyummytreats	PM me
