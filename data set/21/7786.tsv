2008-11-07T05:33:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	brad1	hey here I am if you want to tell me what the trouble is?
2008-11-07T05:35:00.000Z	brad1	Paddy_EIRE	basically when i boot nw i get a million errors about my file system being read-only ..
2008-11-07T05:36:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	brad1	nw?
2008-11-07T05:36:00.000Z	brad1	Paddy_EIRE	sorry?
2008-11-07T05:36:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	brad1	what does nw mean?
2008-11-07T05:37:00.000Z	brad1	Paddy_EIRE	sorry, now*
2008-11-07T05:37:00.000Z	brad1	Paddy_EIRE	yesterday i ran fsck and blindly answered yes to every question ... since then when i boot i get a million errors saying: "read-only file system"
2008-11-07T05:37:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	brad1	ah
2008-11-07T05:38:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	brad1	without knowing what you said yes to I cannot be sure what you did
2008-11-07T05:38:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	brad1	it makes it difficult to retrace your steps
2008-11-07T05:38:00.000Z	brad1	Paddy_EIRE	mmmm yer
2008-11-07T05:39:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	brad1	I would reinstall if it where me and such a thing happened
2008-11-07T05:39:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	brad1	I would also question the health of your HDD just to zero that one out
2008-11-07T05:40:00.000Z	brad1	Paddy_EIRE	well i run fsck from this livecd on the drive and it seems fine :/ does that mean nething
2008-11-07T05:40:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	brad1	hmm.. now that is a bit more interesting
2008-11-07T05:41:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	brad1	although I think the livecd does the check in read-only mode
2008-11-07T05:41:00.000Z	brad1	Paddy_EIRE	naa i made sure it was rw
2008-11-07T05:41:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	brad1	so it would probably not be very informative
2008-11-07T05:41:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	brad1	oh.. hmm
2008-11-07T05:41:00.000Z	brad1	Paddy_EIRE	i will check again to make sure but yer
2008-11-07T05:44:00.000Z	brad1	Paddy_EIRE	how can i make sure im mounting it rw?
