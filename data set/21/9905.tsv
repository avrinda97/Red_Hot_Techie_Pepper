2008-01-22T03:02:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Jinn	 check http://psubuntu.com/2007/02/13/howto-enable-java-for-firefox/
2008-01-22T03:16:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Jinn	 you are rambling.. and it dosent really sound like a Ubuntu related topic. :)
2008-01-22T03:17:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Jinn	 with vmware, or virtualbox . you can run xp under linux. correct. Some people need it.. others dont. :)
2008-01-22T03:17:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Jinn	 dont expect vmware or virtualbox to work on your ps3 however.
2008-01-22T03:19:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Jinn	 go read that link i just posted.. follow the directions.. any problems check the psubuntu.com forums.
2008-01-22T03:19:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Jinn	 all i did was google and find it.
2008-01-22T03:19:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Jinn	 ps3 linux - is still VERY VERY much a work in progress
2008-01-22T03:25:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Jinn	 install vmware, install the os inside vmware.
2008-01-22T03:25:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Jinn	 or virtualbox instead of vmwaer
2008-01-22T03:27:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Jinn	 of coruse if you are wanting to do this on your PS3. i dont think vmware, or virtualbox exist for the ps3linux yet.
2008-01-22T03:28:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Jinn	 what if that last 2% was CRITICAL to your business...
