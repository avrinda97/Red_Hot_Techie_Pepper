2005-08-01T12:47:00.000Z	skalpel	reka	emachine t3882 with intel extreme graphics2 3d integrated
2005-08-01T12:47:00.000Z	skalpel	reka	i can play these files in xp and have no such trouble.
2005-08-01T12:47:00.000Z	reka	skalpel	RAM?

2005-08-01T12:47:00.000Z	reka	skalpel	it might be a sound config quirk ... are you against trying a different player?
2005-08-01T12:48:00.000Z	skalpel	reka	no i am actually for it. i tried to use amarok but it is not compatible with the esd sound engine, supposedly.
2005-08-01T12:48:00.000Z	skalpel	reka	i dont like xmms either
2005-08-01T12:48:00.000Z	reka	skalpel	oh, i was gonna recommend beep-media-player :)
2005-08-01T12:48:00.000Z	reka	skalpel	it's an xmms clone
2005-08-05T11:32:00.000Z	reka	skalpel	there's no quicktime port for linux....install w32codecs for totem, or use a media player with it's own codecs if you want .mov support
2005-08-05T11:36:00.000Z	reka	skalpel	installing the mplayer plugin would probably work
2005-08-05T11:36:00.000Z	reka	skalpel	or you could just run a video player when a .mov file is detected...which is what i do
2005-08-05T11:37:00.000Z	reka	skalpel	what browser?
2005-08-05T11:38:00.000Z	reka	skalpel	install mozilla-mplayer
2005-08-05T11:40:00.000Z	skalpel	reka	what's the command line for installing that?
