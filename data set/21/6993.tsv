2006-12-21T08:41:00.000Z	akerr0r	stefg	tried that, can't get the iso to download onto this liveCD desktop/homedir
2006-12-21T08:42:00.000Z	stefg	akerr0r	does grub show an error number.. #17 is very popular...
2006-12-21T08:42:00.000Z	akerr0r	stefg	yes i was able to get that -once- .. my first install attempt
2006-12-21T08:43:00.000Z	stefg	akerr0r	grub is confused what your (hd0) actually is... see the grub docs on that, there's a chapter on how to deal with swapping device-numbers
2006-12-21T08:44:00.000Z	akerr0r	stefg	is there a way to set it correctly during setup?
2006-12-21T08:46:00.000Z	stefg	akerr0r	you can do that from a grub-prompt before fist boot: find /boot/grub/stage1 ... root(hd {whatever grub found}) ... setup (hd0)..
2006-12-21T08:46:00.000Z	akerr0r	stefg	but my problem seems to be that it's not even seeing grub at all
2006-12-21T08:48:00.000Z	akerr0r	stefg	i have my bios set to boot specifically from my SATA drive. should i change it to boot from the first IDE drive instead? (is that the 'hd0' where grub is being put?)
2006-12-21T08:49:00.000Z	stefg	akerr0r	so what's the situation? You get a grub-error? Grub doesn't get booted? what error do you get?
2006-12-21T08:52:00.000Z	akerr0r	stefg	grub isn't booting at all. it happened once (and i got error 17) when i set the partition it was on (3rd on drive) to Active
2006-12-21T08:52:00.000Z	stefg	akerr0r	google is full of problem reports with taht... seems a commen problem
2006-12-21T08:53:00.000Z	akerr0r	stefg	is it because i'm installing to an SATA drive that isn't normally seen as a boot device?
2006-12-21T08:53:00.000Z	stefg	akerr0r	exactly
2006-12-21T08:55:00.000Z	akerr0r	stefg	does the text/oem installer give me more control over the grub installation than the gui install?
2006-12-21T08:55:00.000Z	stefg	akerr0r	yes
2006-12-21T08:55:00.000Z	akerr0r	stefg	what's the difference between the two? (text/oem)
2006-12-21T08:57:00.000Z	akerr0r	stefg	so i should be able to set the correct grub options from the text installer..
2006-12-21T08:57:00.000Z	stefg	akerr0r	yes
2006-12-21T08:57:00.000Z	akerr0r	stefg	excellent. i'll try that.
2006-12-21T09:36:00.000Z	akerr0r	stefg	ran text install, didn't have extra control over grub.. it auto-installed with hd0 again. changed my bios to boot from the first IDE drive, and now i get GRUB error #17.. looking that up on grub's site atm :|
