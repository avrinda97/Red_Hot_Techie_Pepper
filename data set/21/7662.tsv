2006-08-15T10:13:00.000Z	beesandflowers		cannot find any relevant help about the following error that is halting my ubuntu adventure: your installatino cdrom couldnt be mounted. of course the cd is in the drive. am i missing an article on the www that tells me what to do now?
2006-08-15T10:14:00.000Z	beesandflowers		one solution seems to be changing the cd drive, which seems rather expensive as a guess for my laptop...
2006-08-15T10:15:00.000Z	sethk	beesandflowers	it doesn't give you any etail about the error?
2006-08-15T10:15:00.000Z	sethk	beesandflowers	detail, that is
2006-08-15T10:19:00.000Z	beesandflowers	sethk	no. i downloaded the alternate cd because i had problems with the live cd installation. there is no further messag next to: "Your installation CD-ROM couldn't be mounted. This probably means that the CD-ROM was not in the drive. If so you can insert it and try again. Try again to mount the CD-ROM? <YES> <NO>. no success choosing yes. cd-rom is defenitely in the drive
2006-08-15T10:20:00.000Z	sethk	beesandflowers	I've seen that before when there is confusion about which device is the cd (confusion from the perspective of the kernel)
2006-08-15T10:20:00.000Z	beesandflowers	sethk	i would be happy for any and all resources about solving this problem...
2006-08-15T10:21:00.000Z	sethk	beesandflowers	you might tree using the flag that tells it to not use dma, which I believe is ide=nodma
2006-08-15T10:21:00.000Z	beesandflowers	sethk	will do
2006-08-15T10:21:00.000Z	sethk	beesandflowers	you said this is a laptop?  What kind of hard drive does it have?
2006-08-15T10:22:00.000Z	beesandflowers	sethk	i think an ata drive 5400 seagate momentus
2006-08-15T10:22:00.000Z	sethk	beesandflowers	ide, not sata?
2006-08-15T10:22:00.000Z	sethk	beesandflowers	unless it is a very new laptop it wouldn't be sata.  Even for a new one it is likely not sata in a laptop
2006-08-15T10:23:00.000Z	sethk	beesandflowers	I only asked because I saw a similar problem yesterday with an ide cdrom and an sata hard drive.
2006-08-15T10:25:00.000Z	beesandflowers	sethk	just to make sure i boot the alternate cd press f6 and simply write ide=nodma?
2006-08-15T10:25:00.000Z	sethk	beesandflowers	I'm not certain because I've only done it with breezy and you are using dapper.  The help should tell you
2006-08-20T08:26:00.000Z	sethk	beesandflowers	sounds like a permissions issue
2006-08-20T08:27:00.000Z	beesandflowers	sethk	but i can access all files. in places under nautilus i accessed my server, accessed all files, no problem. but there is nothing in the /mnt directory and i simply would lik eto use the file/open command in applications to open my files.
2006-08-20T08:27:00.000Z	sethk	beesandflowers	/mnt is no different from any other directory name
2006-08-20T08:28:00.000Z	sethk	beesandflowers	what I'm thinking, perhaps, is that nautilus and the application have different effective user ids
2006-08-20T08:32:00.000Z	beesandflowers	sethk	i think i am not properly explaining myself (or i do not understand you). after my ubuntu installation i used the "places" menu in my ubuntu panel to add access to some shares on the server. using nautilus i can access all files as the shares appear on the left panel. so file access is not my problem. but when i use openoffice and the file/open command, then that sharenames are not...
