2009-11-03T01:53:00.000Z	cowguru2000	syk	I don't know... where would I find the logs for s91apache2?
2009-11-03T01:56:00.000Z	syk	cowguru2000	what are you trying to do? just start apache?
2009-11-03T01:56:00.000Z	cowguru2000	syk	yeah
2009-11-03T01:57:00.000Z	syk	cowguru2000	what do u get when u do sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start
2009-11-03T01:57:00.000Z	cowguru2000	syk	i can start apache manually after killing all apache2 processes but the autostart that it apparently has on computer startup stalls
2009-11-03T01:57:00.000Z	syk	cowguru2000	ah
2009-11-03T01:58:00.000Z	cowguru2000	syk	hold on
2009-11-03T01:58:00.000Z	cowguru2000	syk	 * Starting web server apache2                                                  (98)Address already in use: make_sock: could not bind to address 0.0.0.0:8000
2009-11-03T01:59:00.000Z	syk	cowguru2000	and it was working before?
2009-11-03T02:00:00.000Z	cowguru2000	syk	yeah. if i killall apache2 processes and then manually start it (sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start) then it works
