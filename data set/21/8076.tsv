2006-08-01T09:41:00.000Z	jordan_	stefg	How i just want my 2 Pc's Beside eachother to share The Same connection (Seems like it should be easy)
2006-08-01T09:42:00.000Z	stefg	jordan_	20 bucks for a cheap router, so you can switch off the PC's indepently.  ICS only works for LAN connections, not for USB

2006-08-01T09:53:00.000Z	stefg	jordan_	I don't know what you're talking about. if you're on dialup, you could use it, but the only way to network two computers is using..errr... the network cards
