2011-08-18T03:50:00.000Z	babaei	awesomeness	ok, so your computer does recognize that your iphone is there
2011-08-18T03:51:00.000Z	babaei	awesomeness	and I guess you can probably look at the files, etc?
2011-08-18T03:51:00.000Z	awesomeness	babaei	yes it does, even when i go my computer it shows new device named Iphone and there is all my pics but i cant manage media files etc...
2011-08-18T03:51:00.000Z	babaei	awesomeness	now, are you able to pull files from your iphone?
2011-08-18T03:52:00.000Z	babaei	awesomeness	i don't use itunes, but it's my understanding that you can't download files from the iphone?
2011-08-18T03:52:00.000Z	babaei	awesomeness	don't you need to, umm, wipe it and sync the files fresh when you go to a new computer?
2011-08-18T03:52:00.000Z	awesomeness	babaei	there is only pics nothing else, but ya i can copy them to computer, but cant do opposite i mean im not able to manage media files
2011-08-18T03:52:00.000Z	babaei		(like if you used itunes on a different computer)
2011-08-18T03:53:00.000Z	babaei	awesomeness	don't you, like, need to load in your media library and stuff?
2011-08-18T03:53:00.000Z	awesomeness	babaei	 ya and thats what im trying to do )
2011-08-18T03:54:00.000Z	babaei	awesomeness	ah, ok
2011-08-18T03:54:00.000Z	babaei		so, do you have the media files on your computer or something?
2011-08-18T03:54:00.000Z	babaei	awesomeness	i don't know if you can download files from an iphone to your computer - isn't that a hardware limitation (and you run into the same problem with iTunes) ?
2011-08-18T03:55:00.000Z	awesomeness	babaei	maybe i need an app for recognition USB port?
2011-08-18T03:56:00.000Z	babaei	awesomeness	the USB port is ok if you can browse the pictures.
2011-08-18T03:56:00.000Z	awesomeness		thenn have no idea whats the issue :(

2011-08-18T03:59:00.000Z	babaei	awesomeness	make sure you have the package "libimobiledevice" and "libmobiledevice-utils" installed
2011-08-18T03:59:00.000Z	babaei		that might convince it to work?
2011-08-18T04:00:00.000Z	awesomeness	babaei	u r so kind:) let me read it but i believe i don't have any of them (of course it they dont come with this operation system automatically)
2011-08-18T04:05:00.000Z	babaei	awesomeness	those two packages I listed should be something you can get from Synaptic
