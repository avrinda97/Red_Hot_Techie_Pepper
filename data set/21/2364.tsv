2011-08-27T08:53:00.000Z	phrostbite		I am having problems boot from the usb flash drive. I use unetbootin and when I go to boot it just has a screen that says default I push enter and it just reloads the same screen
2011-08-27T08:54:00.000Z	phrostbite		No
2011-08-27T08:55:00.000Z	phrostbite		I downloaded an iso and I am trying to put it on a flash drive so I can install it.
2011-08-27T08:56:00.000Z	phrostbite		or that too
2011-08-27T08:56:00.000Z	hylian	phrostbite	try another menu option, unetbootin sometimes causes errors from the kernel on default
2011-08-27T08:56:00.000Z	phrostbite	hylian	like what?
2011-08-27T08:57:00.000Z	hylian	phrostbite	there are usually more than one option, and if this is an ubuntu cd, one of them should be try ubuntu or install ubuntu
2011-08-27T09:00:00.000Z	hylian	phrostbite	unetbootin is designed to run linux iso's only. it specifically looks for the files in a linux iso.,
2011-08-27T09:00:00.000Z	phrostbite	hylian	Which application should I use for a non linux iso?
2011-08-27T09:02:00.000Z	hylian	phrostbite	to be honest, i have never had to do this. i can take a crack at it, but I am not certain if it can be done. i can do some quick research for you...
2011-08-27T09:02:00.000Z	phrostbite	hylian	that would be awesome. I have been google searching for the last 45 minutes and my brain is going to explode. I have wine installed so maybe a windows application would work?
2011-08-27T09:04:00.000Z	hylian	phrostbite	what version of windows is it>
2011-08-27T09:04:00.000Z	phrostbite	hylian	Windows xp
2011-08-27T09:06:00.000Z	hylian	phrostbite	i found a few. one is here: http://wintoflash.com/home/en/
2011-08-27T09:07:00.000Z	hylian	phrostbite	otherwise here's my google: http://www.google.com/#hl=en&sugexp=tshc&cp=17&gs_id=40&xhr=t&q=install+windows+from+usb&qe=aW5zdGFsbCB3aW5kb3dzIGY&qesig=tjuKk_aL4ddGDJ35B6nnSQ&pkc=AFgZ2tkos5UkLpBHgIPAYaFNpZ2b1w7Ctty1_WQVmBsGJ2zdqBl9e3i5H3wDIIL0slD-kWJT8kii36puyWkPhNUw9Y2eAgq9pw&pq=put+windows+on+a+flash+drive&pf=p&sclient=psy&source=hp&pbx=1&oq=install+windows+f&aq=0&aqi=g5&aql=f&gs_sm=&gs_upl=&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&fp=b62454da27284b07&
2011-08-27T09:07:00.000Z	phrostbite	hylian	I think I may have found something also with unetbootin-windows-248
2011-08-27T09:08:00.000Z	hylian	phrostbite	awesome. so it is dooable from what i read, albeit a little tricky. but defenitely dooable.
2011-08-27T09:09:00.000Z	phrostbite	hylian	grr I think this is just the windows version of unetbootin that will make a linux boot :(
2011-08-27T09:10:00.000Z	hylian	phrostbite	ahh. well there are native windows progs for this job. it looks like wintoflash is your best bet.
2011-08-27T09:11:00.000Z	phrostbite	hylian	thank you so much for your help :)
2011-08-27T09:12:00.000Z	hylian	phrostbite	no prob bob. :)
