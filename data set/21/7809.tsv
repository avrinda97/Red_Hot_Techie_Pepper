2006-08-04T10:08:00.000Z	gnomefreak	abhinay	is there a reason you sent a link to my pm?
2006-08-06T13:31:00.000Z	gnomefreak	abhinay	go to gnome-llok.org
2006-08-06T13:31:00.000Z	gnomefreak	abhinay	go to gnome-look.org
2006-08-06T13:31:00.000Z	abhinay	gnomefreak	name of the splash screen ?
2006-08-06T13:32:00.000Z	gnomefreak	abhinay	i dont know there are thousands of them
2006-08-06T13:32:00.000Z	abhinay	gnomefreak	i like this splash screen very much
2006-08-07T07:15:00.000Z	gnomefreak	abhinay	abd Shinzetsu|AFK join #ubuntu-offtopic
2006-11-08T08:22:00.000Z	gnomefreak	abhinay	install xserver-xorg-video-all
2006-11-08T08:22:00.000Z	gnomefreak	abhinay	also make sure BusID is right
2006-11-08T08:25:00.000Z	gnomefreak	abhinay	if this was an upgrade you may need more packages.
2006-11-08T08:26:00.000Z	abhinay	gnomefreak	edgy is fresh installed. btw, what is BusID ?
2006-11-08T08:27:00.000Z	gnomefreak	abhinay	in /etc/X11/xorg you will see a line under device (driver) BusID PCI:...... that needs to match what pci slot the card is in
2006-11-08T08:27:00.000Z	gnomefreak	abhinay	/etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-11-08T08:28:00.000Z	gnomefreak	abhinay	lspci should give you the busid number
2006-11-08T08:28:00.000Z	gnomefreak	abhinay	it will look like 02:02:0
2006-11-08T08:29:00.000Z	gnomefreak	abhinay	not that exact number but should look simular. if you see a letter in there let me know but iirc edgy shows it as it needs to be not in hex dec
2006-11-08T09:06:00.000Z	abhinay	gnomefreak	there ?
