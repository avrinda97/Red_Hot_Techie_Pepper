2006-07-25T07:29:00.000Z	oskude	Jenkins	are you familiar with partitions ?
2006-07-25T07:30:00.000Z	oskude	Jenkins	you need minimum only 2 partitions... as Smjor said..
2006-07-25T07:30:00.000Z	oskude	Jenkins	ext3 is a format, like fat32 and ntfs
2006-07-25T07:31:00.000Z	oskude	Jenkins	is that one partition extended partition ? do you know what that is ?
2006-07-25T07:33:00.000Z	oskude	Jenkins	i hope youre not trying to resize any ntfs partitions...
2006-07-25T07:34:00.000Z	oskude	Jenkins	ok, sounds good
2006-07-25T07:35:00.000Z	oskude	Jenkins	you came to the right (when not even the best) place :)

2006-07-25T07:44:00.000Z	oskude	Jenkins	heres where you need that "standard" computer knowledge...
2006-07-25T07:45:00.000Z	oskude	Jenkins	then you should know that you can make max 4 primary partitions...
2006-07-25T07:45:00.000Z	oskude	Jenkins	linux doesnt care if its primary or logical
2006-07-25T07:45:00.000Z	oskude	Jenkins	as i said, linux doesnt care...
2006-07-25T07:47:00.000Z	oskude	Jenkins	that could be the windows partition, where do you have windows installed ?
2006-07-25T07:48:00.000Z	oskude	Jenkins	HDA means HD in IDE1 as master, HDB means HD in IDE1 as slave, HDB means HD in IDE2 as master, and so on
2006-07-25T07:48:00.000Z	oskude	Jenkins	and hda1 is the first partition on it, hda2 the second and so on
