2009-12-26T17:47:00.000Z	grawity	qt-x	SCP, SFTP, and SSHFS require SSH.
2009-12-26T17:47:00.000Z	grawity		SCP is older, SFTP is recommended. SSHFS uses SFTP.
2009-12-26T17:48:00.000Z	qt-x		if i use command like scp sorce dest wont work without ssh connection ?
2009-12-26T17:49:00.000Z	qt-x		so that is how it works :D
2009-12-26T17:49:00.000Z	qt-x		secure copy :D scp
2009-12-26T17:49:00.000Z	qt-x		so scp is a client for ssh server
2009-12-26T17:49:00.000Z	qt-x		:D
2009-12-26T17:50:00.000Z	grawity	qt-x	technically, the client is "ssh" -- when you run scp, it uses ssh to connect. (The "sftp" command does the same.)
2009-12-26T17:54:00.000Z	qt-x		in order to exchange data thru ssh,it is require to have on both machines a ssh server or  just one of them ?
2009-12-26T17:55:00.000Z	qt-x		hi  paw162
2009-12-26T17:56:00.000Z	qt-x	llutz	how will it look the command for sending a file from the machine with ssh server to the one without ?
2009-12-26T18:02:00.000Z	qt-x		i think aman whant th the abiliti of 'screen' command
2009-12-26T18:04:00.000Z	qt-x		lunching a command in with screen it allow you to close the terminal even logout of system :D
2009-12-26T18:05:00.000Z	qt-x		man screen for more details :D
2009-12-26T18:10:00.000Z	qt-x		Can I use scp between GNU/Linux and windows[putty] ?
2009-12-26T18:10:00.000Z	qt-x		:D
2009-12-26T18:15:00.000Z	qt-x		Is there a way to connect ssh to a virtual ip and how do i wrote the address if yes ?
2009-12-26T18:16:00.000Z	qt-x		a ip that is local and not directly on internet i guess.
2009-12-26T18:17:00.000Z	qt-x		won't work
2009-12-26T18:17:00.000Z	qt-x		only if ip is real
2009-12-26T18:17:00.000Z	grawity	qt-x	1) There is no such thing as "virtual IP address". 2) Both LAN and Internet addresses are used in the same way.
