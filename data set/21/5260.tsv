2007-11-28T10:29:00.000Z	ata4ix		i do wrong?
2007-11-28T10:30:00.000Z	ata4ix		yes they are enable but not for vesa
2007-11-28T10:30:00.000Z	ata4ix		CONFIG_VESA_FB= is not typed in /boot/config
2007-11-28T10:30:00.000Z	ata4ix		hm
2007-11-28T10:30:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	ata4ix	check out the gentoo page for information on enabling framebuffer in the kernel config
2007-11-28T10:31:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	ata4ix	depending on your chipset you might need to enable vesa-fb or vesafb-tng
2007-11-28T10:31:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	ata4ix	yes their documentation on enabling framebuffer suppot is very good.  the chipset of your graphics card
2007-11-28T10:32:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	ata4ix	iirc that means you should use vesafb-tng but you should check up on that
2007-11-28T10:32:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	ata4ix	if i remember correctly.  sorry
2007-11-28T10:33:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	ata4ix	when you say CONFIG_VESA_FB is not typed in the kernel, do you mean that gcc complains that you need to have a typed int in the header file when you try to compile, or do you mean that searching the config file for that generates no results?
2007-11-28T10:34:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	ata4ix	that should be all you need
2007-11-28T10:34:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	ata4ix	exactly what is the problem.  does the splash screen not work?
2007-11-28T10:35:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	ata4ix	boot with the cheat code vga=791
2007-11-28T10:36:00.000Z	ata4ix	infinitycircuit	ill try now again
2007-11-28T10:37:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	ata4ix	you can try vga=773 to lower the number of colors
2007-11-28T10:38:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	ata4ix	vga=5 will not work.  try vga=773 if vga=791 fails for you
2007-11-28T10:38:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	ata4ix	also, is there any reason you turned off splash and quiet as boot options
2007-11-28T10:38:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	ata4ix	ok that's good then
2007-11-28T10:38:00.000Z	ata4ix	infinitycircuit	yes i disable this
2007-11-28T10:41:00.000Z	ata4ix	infinitycircuit	if i disables splash and quiet as boot options this is bad for vga=791?
2007-11-28T10:42:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	ata4ix	i don't believe so but i'm not sure.  i have never used vga bootcodes on ubuntu
