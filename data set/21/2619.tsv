2009-08-29T13:36:00.000Z	xsebsx		back on kde
2009-08-29T13:36:00.000Z	xsebsx		i don't htink this is the kde i had installed
2009-08-29T13:36:00.000Z	xsebsx		i think this is an older version of kde
2009-08-29T13:36:00.000Z	xsebsx		the current or soemthing
2009-08-29T13:37:00.000Z	ikonia	xsebsx	install the package kubuntu-desktop and it will install the current ubuntu kde version for you
2009-08-29T13:37:00.000Z	ikonia	xsebsx	then you didn't get that version of kde from ubuntu
2009-08-29T13:37:00.000Z	ikonia	xsebsx	http://www.kubuntu.org/news/kde-4.3
2009-08-29T13:38:00.000Z	ikonia	xsebsx	read tha link
2009-08-29T13:40:00.000Z	xsebsx	ikonia	bazhang: i get this output when i try to open nicotine http://pastebin.ca/1546896
2009-08-29T13:41:00.000Z	ikonia	xsebsx	you're missing dependencies and looks like a version conflict also at a glance
2009-08-29T13:41:00.000Z	xsebsx	ikonia	great, that''s more than before, what do i have to do to solve this?
2009-08-29T13:42:00.000Z	ikonia	xsebsx	first thing would be to install the dependency packages, then work out the conflict
2009-08-29T13:42:00.000Z	xsebsx	ikonia	how do i install THOSE dependency packages?
2009-08-29T13:43:00.000Z	xsebsx	ikonia	what are the packages i have to get and how do i get them? sudo aptitude install what else?
2009-08-29T13:44:00.000Z	ikonia	xsebsx	search the pyvorbis (python->vobis bindings_ package, that seems a good start
2009-08-29T13:44:00.000Z	xsebsx	ikonia	on the package manager?
2009-08-29T13:44:00.000Z	ikonia	xsebsx	yes
2009-08-29T13:46:00.000Z	xsebsx	ikonia	if i type pyvorbis it says there's no matching application available
2009-08-29T13:47:00.000Z	xsebsx	ikonia	no matching application available
2009-08-29T13:47:00.000Z	xsebsx	ikonia	this doesn't make any sense, nicotine was workign well, hten i downloaded xubuntu and then i started having troubles with it
2009-08-29T13:50:00.000Z	xsebsx	ikonia	so if i wait till the next release i can get the kde i had before?
