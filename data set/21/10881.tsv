2004-10-16T11:07:00.000Z	fsc		doom3 is disappointing to say the least
2004-10-16T11:07:00.000Z	fsc		at least allow us to use our freaking flashlight with our gun without using a hack
2004-10-16T11:08:00.000Z	fsc		its indictive of not being well thought out...the whole game is indicative of Id living in the past
2004-10-16T11:09:00.000Z	fsc		the engine is great, i'm talking about the gameplay
2004-10-16T11:09:00.000Z	fsc		i'd like to see what the engine can do with outdoor scenes
2004-10-16T11:10:00.000Z	fsc		did id release the sdk yet?
2004-10-16T11:10:00.000Z	fsc		I couldn't believe how rocking the crytek engine is...it blew my mind
2004-10-16T11:10:00.000Z	t35t0r	fsc	the only outdoor scene i've seen in the demo is when you go outside in the martian environment for a few seconds of the air supply you have ..w
2004-10-16T11:11:00.000Z	t35t0r	fsc	i think far cry is a much more gpu/cpu intensive game
2004-10-16T11:11:00.000Z	fsc	t35t0r	not me. i get better framerates on farcry than doom3
2004-10-16T11:11:00.000Z	t35t0r	fsc	ahh really? in winxp right?
2004-10-16T11:12:00.000Z	fsc	t35t0r	yes
2004-10-16T11:13:00.000Z	t35t0r	fsc	well i've had no problems in d3 at medium graphics 1024x768 w/radeon 9600 ..only thing is i can't get out of the lower rooms when all hell breaks lose ...how do you get out of that room with the lower and raising bridge?
2004-10-16T11:13:00.000Z	fsc	t35t0r	i've got the 9600 pro too
2004-10-16T11:13:00.000Z	fsc	t35t0r	i tend to run at 800x600 with higher settings though
2004-10-16T11:13:00.000Z	t35t0r	fsc	do you know which place i'm talking about in the demo
2004-10-16T11:14:00.000Z	fsc	t35t0r	not sure if i've got there yet.  i just got past the tram stage
