2007-02-15T07:12:00.000Z	xstasi		on which i want to install ubuntu
2007-02-15T07:12:00.000Z	xstasi		right?
2007-02-15T07:12:00.000Z	xstasi		ok
2007-02-15T07:13:00.000Z	xstasi		from debian, i am debootstrapping into the empty partition
2007-02-15T07:13:00.000Z	xstasi		and i just finished
2007-02-15T07:13:00.000Z	xstasi		ok
2007-02-15T07:13:00.000Z	xstasi		now, all that i want
2007-02-15T07:13:00.000Z	xstasi		is a "stock" ubuntu
2007-02-15T07:13:00.000Z	xstasi		like as i installed from teh cd
2007-02-15T07:13:00.000Z	xstasi		s/teh/the/
2007-02-15T07:13:00.000Z	varkatope	xstasi	so why cant u just boot from alternate install cd and install ubuntu that way?
2007-02-15T07:13:00.000Z	xstasi	varkatope	that would take much time to download, and a cd to burn
2007-02-15T07:17:00.000Z	varkatope	xstasi	this discussion has come to an end, there will be no proprietary drivers installed by default on feisty, and thats good because its ubuntu philosophy to stay opensource
2007-02-15T07:18:00.000Z	xstasi	varkatope	right, i get it
2007-02-15T07:19:00.000Z	xstasi	varkatope	a good workaround could be to install from framebuffer too, like new debian installer
2007-02-15T07:19:00.000Z	xstasi	varkatope	i mean, one should be able to install ubuntu on any computer with any video board
2007-02-15T07:21:00.000Z	varkatope	xstasi	opensource drivers cover most graphic chipsets, so installation is no problem
2007-02-15T07:22:00.000Z	xstasi	varkatope	they only cover til 9200, speaking of ati radeon
2007-02-15T07:22:00.000Z	varkatope	xstasi	i had now problems installing on an radeon 9800 pro
2007-02-15T07:23:00.000Z	xstasi	varkatope	so if a friend of mine tells me "the cd you gave me is freezing on boot, and i can't install ubuntu"
2007-02-15T07:23:00.000Z	varkatope	xstasi	i would encourage him to try the alternate install cd
