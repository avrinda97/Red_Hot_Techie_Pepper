2005-11-28T13:29:00.000Z	White-Wolf		Can anyone help me with a StartX/GUI problem?
2005-11-28T13:30:00.000Z	soundray	White-Wolf	we'll try.
2005-11-28T13:31:00.000Z	soundray	White-Wolf	detail?
2005-11-28T13:35:00.000Z	soundray	White-Wolf	if you look at /var/log/Xorg.0.log, you may get a clue as to what goes wrong.
2005-11-28T13:48:00.000Z	soundray	White-Wolf	with console I mean a text screen.
2005-11-28T13:37:00.000Z	soundray	White-Wolf	you can put the file up on pastebin.ubuntulinux.nl if you want.
2005-11-28T13:40:00.000Z	soundray	White-Wolf	sudo ls then.
2005-11-28T13:40:00.000Z	soundray	White-Wolf	*lsusb
2005-11-28T13:42:00.000Z	soundray	White-Wolf	'sudo lsusb' and hit return.
2005-11-28T13:45:00.000Z	soundray	White-Wolf	sorry, I was getting confused. Have you looked at your /var/log/Xorg.0.log ?
2005-11-28T13:46:00.000Z	soundray	White-Wolf	you're on the console, right?
2005-11-28T13:49:00.000Z	soundray	White-Wolf	what do you get when you enter whoami ?
2005-11-28T13:50:00.000Z	soundray	White-Wolf	can you do a 'ls -l /var/log/Xorg.0.log' and tell me what the permissions and owners are, something like '-rw-r--r--  1 root root'
2005-11-28T13:52:00.000Z	soundray	White-Wolf	now what do you get from 'ls -l /var/log/Xorg.0.log' ?
2005-11-28T13:56:00.000Z	soundray	White-Wolf	okay, now do a 'cat  /var/log/Xorg.0.log' and see if the trailing lines make sense to you.
2005-11-28T13:58:00.000Z	soundray	White-Wolf	is anything in the *trailing lines* that makes sense, like "no pointer found" or something?
2005-11-28T14:00:00.000Z	soundray	White-Wolf	X writes a lot of stuff in the log, but we're interested in what happened when it failed. That's usually the last entry.
2005-11-28T14:02:00.000Z	soundray	White-Wolf	what video card do you have?
2005-11-28T14:04:00.000Z	soundray	White-Wolf	have you installed the fglrx stuff?
2005-11-28T14:05:00.000Z	soundray	White-Wolf	you need to follow the instructions for ATI cards. Ubotu sent you a message.
