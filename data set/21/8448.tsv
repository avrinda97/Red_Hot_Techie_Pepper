2006-04-03T13:42:00.000Z	harisund		In the Ubuntu Fridge events, what time zones are the events mentioned in? For example it says on March 30th there is a Edubuntu meeting from 16:00 to 18:00.. in what time zone?
2006-04-03T13:42:00.000Z	Madpilot	harisund	UTC/Zulu, probably
2006-04-25T09:54:00.000Z	Madpilot	harisund	try System->Preferences->Mouse?
2006-04-25T09:55:00.000Z	harisund	Madpilot	it's gnome-mouse-properties. Thanks for that help a lot.
2006-04-29T05:11:00.000Z	Madpilot	harisund	because ext3 doesn't need defraging like MS formats do
2006-04-29T05:12:00.000Z	Madpilot	harisund	AFAIK, yes
2006-04-29T05:13:00.000Z	harisund	Madpilot	and pmafia: ok that's good to hear. Now how do I boot Ubuntu LiveCD into command line only mode?
2006-05-02T13:46:00.000Z	Madpilot	harisund	yes
2006-05-11T12:01:00.000Z	Madpilot	harisund	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveCDPersistence
2006-08-11T13:35:00.000Z	Madpilot	harisund	too late, you just did ;)
2006-08-11T13:37:00.000Z	Madpilot	harisund	some of us have our IRC clients set up to beep on [bang] ops
2006-09-17T10:30:00.000Z	harisund	Madpilot	do you know of any other tool that is as sweet as wget? I have wget running on my Cygwin as well :)
2006-09-17T10:57:00.000Z	Madpilot	harisund	is that the same Christian Ubuntu project that had it's IRC channel here on Freenode shut down because the ops were being abusive?
2006-09-17T10:57:00.000Z	harisund	Madpilot	oh.. about that I do not know . I just know there's a Christian edition because I read the Ubuntu Planet blogs..
2006-09-17T10:58:00.000Z	Madpilot	harisund	I think there's more than one, actually. The one I saw on planet.ubuntu.com was "Ichthux" or something like that
2006-09-17T10:58:00.000Z	harisund	Madpilot	oh yeah ichthux.. this isn't that then?
2006-09-17T11:01:00.000Z	Madpilot	harisund	not sure. I just remember the trouble w/ #ubuntu-christian a while back
2006-09-17T11:01:00.000Z	harisund	Madpilot	I see.. ok ..
2006-09-27T12:58:00.000Z	Madpilot	harisund	try "top" - but don't worry too much, memory is there to be used, after all
2006-10-08T09:09:00.000Z	Madpilot	harisund	looks like 2.6.15-27-386
2006-10-08T09:09:00.000Z	harisund	Madpilot	ah ok .. the Ubuntu wiki says 2.6.17 is in the repos, but I coulnd't find it (atleast not in the official repos)
