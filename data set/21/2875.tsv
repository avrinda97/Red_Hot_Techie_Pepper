2009-12-16T16:35:00.000Z	NickRiviera		HI EVERYBODY!
2009-12-16T16:36:00.000Z	NickRiviera		I have a rather noob question... I've noticed many services run under their own user/group; but when I look in the User Settings, I cannot see those users. I can see the groups, but no users. Why?
2009-12-16T16:36:00.000Z	yacc	NickRiviera	system users.
2009-12-16T16:38:00.000Z	yacc	NickRiviera	you do not manage them, usually, and they are flagged by having a low uid.
2009-12-16T16:38:00.000Z	yacc	NickRiviera	the system manages them by itself.
2009-12-16T16:38:00.000Z	NickRiviera	yacc	Ok, suppose I need to change the user under which mysql runs (from mysql to sql). Is that too much of a hassle?
2009-12-16T16:39:00.000Z	yacc	NickRiviera	Why would you want that to do?
2009-12-16T16:39:00.000Z	NickRiviera	yacc	 I don't, but suppose I did.
2009-12-16T16:39:00.000Z	yacc	NickRiviera	And yes, it's almost not worth it, because all kinds of system scripts will probably break.
2009-12-16T16:39:00.000Z	NickRiviera	yacc	since they all know mysql runs under user mysql...
2009-12-16T16:40:00.000Z	yacc	NickRiviera	exactly, all packages that need to have their own user manage them with the provided automatic tools.
2009-12-16T16:40:00.000Z	NickRiviera	yacc	is it possible to login as one such user?
2009-12-16T16:41:00.000Z	NickRiviera	yacc	for instance, login as mysql?
2009-12-16T16:41:00.000Z	yacc	NickRiviera	sudo su -s /bin/sh mysql
2009-12-16T16:41:00.000Z	NickRiviera	yacc	can you break that down?
2009-12-16T16:44:00.000Z	NickRiviera	yacc	two more questions: 1) Are users/permissions/groups in Ubuntu too different from other *nix flavours? 2) Where should I look to learn more about users / permissions / groups for linux in general and/or ubuntu???
2009-12-16T16:45:00.000Z	yacc	NickRiviera	google, only thing is that Ubuntu like Debian defaults to "each user has it's own group", (google that too if you wonder why), ...
2009-12-16T16:46:00.000Z	NickRiviera	yacc	yeah I noticed that... doesn't happen on Red Hat...
2009-12-16T16:47:00.000Z	yacc	NickRiviera	if you want to figure for yourself, lookup umask and what setgid does when set on directories.
2009-12-16T16:49:00.000Z	NickRiviera	yacc	so when I manase my user, atannus, my main group is atannus, but when I manage group atannus, my user 'Andre Tannus' isn't ticked in that group....  that causes my brain to hurt.
2009-12-16T17:11:00.000Z	NickRiviera	yacc	u back!
