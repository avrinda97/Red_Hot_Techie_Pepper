2008-08-26T20:06:00.000Z	dbl17z	ActionParsnip	have you ever come across and issue like this ?
2008-08-26T20:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dbl17z	then the common factor is the keyboard or the cd
2008-08-26T20:16:00.000Z	dbl17z	ActionParsnip	What I did was install ubuntu from the Samurai WTF live distro. So I get ubuntu for now until I figure out what the hell this issue is.
