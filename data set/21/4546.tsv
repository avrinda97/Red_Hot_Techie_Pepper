2008-05-18T02:44:00.000Z	amirman84	narothepharoh	have you installed all the restricted codecs?
2008-05-18T02:44:00.000Z	narothepharoh	amirman84	i did before upgrade do i have to do it again?
2008-05-18T02:45:00.000Z	amirman84	narothepharoh	that's what i would try, i'm guessing the codecs are different for hardy than they were in gutsy
2008-05-18T02:46:00.000Z	narothepharoh	amirman84	do you know the command?

2008-05-18T02:47:00.000Z	amirman84		rockfire: don't do it!!!
2008-05-18T02:49:00.000Z	amirman84		rockfire; i'm kinda kidding, but i've always seen google toolbar as useless spyware, i think the only useful feature it has is searching entire domains, but i'm sure firefox has an extension for that anyway
2008-05-18T02:49:00.000Z	amirman84		rockfire: for a regular google search you can just use the google toolbar that is already built into the browser
2008-05-18T02:51:00.000Z	amirman84		rockfire: you might want to search mozilla.com on the extensions page for something that'll let you have access to your google bookmarks, i'm pretty sure they have that
2008-05-18T02:51:00.000Z	amirman84		rockfire: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/search?q=google+bookmarks&cat=all&sourceid=Mozilla-search
2008-05-18T02:51:00.000Z	amirman84		rockfire: no, why do you ask?
2008-05-18T02:52:00.000Z	amirman84		rockfire: lol, no, i jsut wanted amirman but it was registered already
2008-05-18T02:53:00.000Z	amirman84		rockfire: it's a play on words, a mere man, and my name is amir, so you know...
2008-05-18T02:54:00.000Z	amirman84		rockfire: i've only been using linux for about a month
2008-05-18T02:54:00.000Z	amirman84		rockfire: it's fun because it's hard
2008-05-18T02:55:00.000Z	narothepharoh	amirman84	Thanks I appreciate it I guess I didnt have the codecs installed well see if it works now?
2008-05-18T02:56:00.000Z	amirman84	narothepharoh	i hope it works out for you
