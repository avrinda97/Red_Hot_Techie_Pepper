2010-03-20T23:33:00.000Z	PCLoadLetter		anyone here familiar with crontab?  just on the basic level?
2010-03-20T23:33:00.000Z	pedahzur	PCLoadLetter	What's up?
2010-03-20T23:34:00.000Z	pedahzur	PCLoadLetter	What's the issue? Not running? running with error?
2010-03-20T23:35:00.000Z	pedahzur	PCLoadLetter	how did you create this file? crontab -e?
2010-03-20T23:36:00.000Z	pedahzur	PCLoadLetter	Are you sure 'cron' is running?  What does ps -AF|grep -i cron return?
2010-03-20T23:36:00.000Z	pedahzur	PCLoadLetter	Did you keep an eye on /var/log/syslog? Is there any record of cron trying to invoke it?
2010-03-20T23:37:00.000Z	pedahzur	PCLoadLetter	What user is this running as?  Is there anything in that user's mail file at /var/log/spool/mail?
2010-03-20T23:39:00.000Z	pedahzur	PCLoadLetter	You do realize that your cron is configured to run the command at 2:19PM local time, right?
2010-03-20T23:40:00.000Z	pedahzur	PCLoadLetter	tip: put my name at the beginning of your replies. That way, my client dings (and highlights the reply in red) so it's easier for me to find your responses.
2010-03-20T23:41:00.000Z	PCLoadLetter	pedahzur	sorry about that. its been awhile since i've looked at irc or ubuntu.. lol
2010-03-20T23:41:00.000Z	PCLoadLetter	pedahzur	i uploaded the grep output to http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/Jp2yj7MH
2010-03-20T23:42:00.000Z	pedahzur	PCLoadLetter	I would recommend installing something like Postfix (in local-only mode if you don't need to use it to send mail off-system) so there is something cron can use to mail the output of the command.
2010-03-20T23:42:00.000Z	pedahzur	PCLoadLetter	Yeah, saw the ps -AF output. So cron is running.
2010-03-20T23:43:00.000Z	PCLoadLetter	pedahzur	 i will check the syslog right now and look into postfix.  from what you've seen though, is anything out of the ordinary?
2010-03-20T23:45:00.000Z	PCLoadLetter	pedahzur	 yes.. the syslog is definitely being invoked
2010-03-20T23:46:00.000Z	pedahzur	PCLoadLetter	The command looks ok in the crontab.  I would suspect some error output is being generated and not e-mailed since there is no e-mail system installed.
2010-03-20T23:48:00.000Z	pedahzur	PCLoadLetter	/home/adempiere/Adempiere/utils/RUN_DBExport.sh  I assume the path is correct?
2010-03-20T23:48:00.000Z	PCLoadLetter	pedahzur	correct
2010-03-20T23:49:00.000Z	pedahzur	PCLoadLetter	yeah, everything looks correct.  I would have to see the output of the cron command, and you can only get that to my knowledge via the output being mailed.
2010-03-20T23:51:00.000Z	PCLoadLetter	pedahzur	 thanks for helping me look into my crontab.  i will check out postfix right now to see if i can get the output mailed to me
2010-03-20T23:53:00.000Z	pedahzur	PCLoadLetter	You're welcome.
