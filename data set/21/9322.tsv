2007-12-29T05:48:00.000Z	Jan`		And I can't use a mac to copy the files to a FAT32 volume because... I don't have a mac.
2007-12-29T05:48:00.000Z	Jan`		If I had a mac, I'd just network it across.
2007-12-29T05:50:00.000Z	Jan`		You see the problem here.
2007-12-29T05:50:00.000Z	Jan`		I'm stuffed every way I turn.
2007-12-29T05:51:00.000Z	Jan`		So the Linux approach solves many problems.
2007-12-29T05:52:00.000Z	Jan`		If someone can confirm to me that I can install the latest version of Ubuntu on a desktop PC, plug the firewire disk in and have a window pop up with its contents, great.
2007-12-29T05:52:00.000Z	Jan`		If not, I'll go buy a Mac Mini off Ebay.
2007-12-29T05:52:00.000Z	Jan`		:)
2007-12-29T05:53:00.000Z	Jan`		That is an interesting idea though.
2007-12-29T05:53:00.000Z	Jan`		Especially if... it can write to NTFS disks?
2007-12-29T05:54:00.000Z	nickrud	Jan`	yes it can
2007-12-29T05:54:00.000Z	nickrud	Jan`	unfortunately it doesn't talk to new ipods though
2007-12-29T06:01:00.000Z	Jan`	nickrud	It's short for Janine :)
2007-12-29T06:01:00.000Z	nickrud	Jan`	I used the neuter he :)
2007-12-29T07:57:00.000Z	nickrud	Jan`	now put it in, and see the Flaming Fury :)
2007-12-30T01:42:00.000Z	nickrud	Jan`	depends on the reason
2007-12-30T01:43:00.000Z	Jan`	nickrud	Pretty simple, really - the default resolution seems to be one that the display (an HD LCD TV) doesn't support ("PC-VGA: Out of Range")
2007-12-30T01:43:00.000Z	nickrud	Jan`	probably true. If you know the horizontal sync and vertical refresh of your tv , then that fixres link tells you how to apply them
2007-12-30T01:44:00.000Z	nickrud	Jan`	although another guy was just here with problems with his hd tv, more than just those rates
2007-12-30T01:44:00.000Z	Jan`	nickrud	Well, we would, but there's no actual display to work with.
2007-12-30T01:45:00.000Z	nickrud	Jan`	what kind of video card do you have?
