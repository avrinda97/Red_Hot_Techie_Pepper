2011-03-29T16:38:00.000Z	ohsix	keyUp	if it is indeed a web sever, you just need to look up ip based virtual hosting with your prefered web server
2011-03-29T16:40:00.000Z	keyUp	ohsix	ah that is very nice
2011-03-29T16:41:00.000Z	keyUp	ohsix	but I don't understand it
2011-03-31T15:59:00.000Z	ohsix	keyUp	are all the lights on on the modem? those modems are bridges
2011-03-31T16:01:00.000Z	ohsix	keyUp	some isps have firmware that firewalls you from snmp/the web status page if some unknown things happen
2011-03-31T16:01:00.000Z	keyUp	ohsix	that modem page I cant even open
2011-03-31T16:02:00.000Z	ohsix	keyUp	keyUp paste the output of route -n to a pastebin
2011-03-31T16:03:00.000Z	ohsix	keyUp	you're using dhcp right? not static config?
2011-03-31T16:04:00.000Z	keyUp	ohsix	i havent changed anything in automatic eth conection when i con to eth it make connectio automatically and yes it is dhcp automatic
2011-03-31T16:18:00.000Z	ohsix	keyUp	your original problem isn't in my buffer, if you could restate ...
2011-03-31T16:35:00.000Z	ohsix	keyUp	try the usb port if you're connecting directly
2011-03-31T16:36:00.000Z	ohsix	keyUp	well, you want what works, right?
2011-03-31T16:37:00.000Z	ohsix	keyUp	people tried
2011-03-31T16:39:00.000Z	ohsix	keyUp	if you insist on keeping use of enter for punctuation, could you speak in msg with the person helping you?
2011-03-31T16:40:00.000Z	ohsix	keyUp	you can be connected to both
2011-03-31T16:40:00.000Z	keyUp	ohsix	i lose internet if both are connected duno why
2011-03-31T16:42:00.000Z	ohsix	keyUp	if the modem is new it could be busy updating its firmware, the web server is low priority, it might never load; but the modem is still working
2011-03-31T16:45:00.000Z	ohsix	keyUp	what you did with your isp is pretty irrelevant
2011-03-31T16:48:00.000Z	ohsix	keyUp	forget the modem page, just forget  it
2011-03-31T17:37:00.000Z	ohsix	keyUp	none are relevant to anything, nor ubuntu relevant
