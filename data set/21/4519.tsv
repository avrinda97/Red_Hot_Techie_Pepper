2010-06-07T00:25:00.000Z	ubutom	draginxx	sounds like broken hd to me
2010-06-07T00:25:00.000Z	draginxx	ubutom	reeealllly? Anyway to make sure?
2010-06-07T00:26:00.000Z	ubutom	draginxx	dunno, you could try to do a filesystem chek
2010-06-07T00:26:00.000Z	draginxx	ubutom	whats the command line for that? fsck ?
2010-06-07T00:26:00.000Z	ubutom	draginxx	yeah, fsck, hm...
2010-06-07T00:27:00.000Z	draginxx	ubutom	 I have a disk in the disck tray if that makes any difference..
2010-06-07T00:28:00.000Z	draginxx	ubutom	correct
2010-06-07T00:29:00.000Z	ubutom	draginxx	do you know the device name of your root partition?
2010-06-07T00:29:00.000Z	ubutom	draginxx	like dev/sda /sdc or whatever
2010-06-07T00:30:00.000Z	ubutom	draginxx	well, each device has its own device name
2010-06-07T00:30:00.000Z	draginxx	ubutom	right i have no idea on how I would even know what devices i have
2010-06-07T00:30:00.000Z	ubutom	draginxx	are you on a rescue prompt right now?
2010-06-07T00:31:00.000Z	draginxx	ubutom	i tried but it brought me back to the initramfs thing
2010-06-07T00:35:00.000Z	ubutom	draginxx	triey booting a livecd?
2010-06-07T00:35:00.000Z	draginxx	ubutom	no actually what live cd should I use?
2010-06-07T00:35:00.000Z	ubutom	draginxx	ubuntu install disc will do
2010-06-07T00:36:00.000Z	draginxx	ubutom	true, ok thanks mate :) ill try to get it with thel ive cd
2010-06-07T00:36:00.000Z	ubutom	draginxx	hopefully ou can access the data on the disk from there ;)
2010-06-07T00:37:00.000Z	draginxx	ubutom	let's assume th live cd works how would I get to the hd's content?
2010-06-07T00:38:00.000Z	ubutom	draginxx	you should be able to explore the box and mount it with a simple click
2010-06-07T00:39:00.000Z	ubutom	draginxx	if i am correct, fsck should be done while the disk isn't mounted, either way you can see the device name of the disc and use fsck accordingly, like fsck /dev/sda
