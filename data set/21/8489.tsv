2006-12-05T12:39:00.000Z	kuzmaster		when i do hostname, hostname -f, it returns what the hostname should be
2006-12-05T12:39:00.000Z	kuzmaster		the hostname should be "frankie"
2006-12-05T12:40:00.000Z	kuzmaster		127.0.0.1       localhost
2006-12-05T12:42:00.000Z	kuzmaster		so..... somthing like........... "127.0.0.1localhost frankie"?
2006-12-05T12:42:00.000Z	kuzmaster		because, this is just to serve an intranet

2006-12-05T12:39:00.000Z	DBO	kuzmaster	whats the issue?
2006-12-05T12:40:00.000Z	kuzmaster	DBO	'it' is my ubuntu server
2006-12-05T12:40:00.000Z	kuzmaster	DBO	that comman outputted this: 127.0.0.1       localhost
2006-12-05T12:41:00.000Z	DBO	kuzmaster	ok, in your /etc/hosts file change that line to read "127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost YOURHOSTNAME"
2006-12-05T12:42:00.000Z	DBO	kuzmaster	yeah thats fine
2006-12-05T12:43:00.000Z	DBO	kuzmaster	but make sure there is a space between each entry
2006-12-05T12:44:00.000Z	DBO	kuzmaster	once you finish editing /etc/hosts, do the same to /etc/hostname
2006-12-05T12:45:00.000Z	DBO	kuzmaster	aka make sure frankie is in your /etc/hostname
2006-12-05T12:45:00.000Z	kuzmaster	DBO	ummmm... in the /ect/hosts, there is a line llike this..... "127.0.1.1 frankie"
2006-12-05T12:46:00.000Z	kuzmaster	DBO	does that mean anything?
