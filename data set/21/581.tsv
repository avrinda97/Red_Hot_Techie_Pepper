2011-09-17T02:39:00.000Z	astruasdh		is 32-bit versions more stable than the 64-bit one?
2011-09-17T02:41:00.000Z	astruasdh		I got this message while aptitude full-upgrade at grub-pc package: http://pastebin.com/ruPsbiKt
2011-09-17T02:42:00.000Z	astruasdh		If I hit "yes", the same screen appear again. If I hit no, it do not install the grub-pc. Is it a bug?
2011-09-17T02:42:00.000Z	macer1	astruasdh	what ubuntu version?
2011-09-17T02:42:00.000Z	astruasdh		10.04LTS
2011-09-17T02:43:00.000Z	macer1	astruasdh	i think you can not install it if your bootloader works now
2011-09-17T02:44:00.000Z	astruasdh	macer1	this 10.04TLS is the latest ubuntu version?
2011-09-17T02:44:00.000Z	macer1	astruasdh	there are LTS versions and normal versions.
2011-09-17T02:45:00.000Z	macer1		latest LTS is 10.04
2011-09-17T02:45:00.000Z	macer1		normal release is 11.04
2011-09-17T02:46:00.000Z	astruasdh	macer1	got it... it is a weird cloud solution I have access to. Nothing to do: this version or centos... I prefere ubuntu. Do you think I should try with 32-bit version?
2011-09-17T02:47:00.000Z	macer1	astruasdh	you are running this ubuntu in cloud?
2011-09-17T02:48:00.000Z	astruasdh	macer1	yeah... no option. is it weird?
2011-09-17T02:48:00.000Z	astruasdh	macer1	it will be the webserver
2011-09-17T02:49:00.000Z	macer1		I think that expains everything :D
2011-09-17T02:49:00.000Z	astruasdh	macer1	what? too weird?
2011-09-17T02:49:00.000Z	macer1		if server has its own bootloader and kernel, there can be no place to install grub, like MBR.
2011-09-17T02:50:00.000Z	astruasdh	macer1	do you think it is safe not to install grub and keep going?
2011-09-17T02:51:00.000Z	astruasdh	macer1	i really want to keep the ubuntu updated
2011-09-17T02:51:00.000Z	astruasdh		not to update is not an option for me
2011-09-17T02:52:00.000Z	macer1	astruasdh	i think it is safe to not install grub.
