2010-05-16T12:19:00.000Z	wildbat	willberg	is your hostname file own by root?
2010-05-16T12:19:00.000Z	willberg	wildbat	it doesn't exist!
2010-05-16T12:20:00.000Z	wildbat	willberg	create it withour sudo
2010-05-16T12:20:00.000Z	wildbat	willberg	create it with* our sudo
2010-05-16T12:23:00.000Z	willberg	wildbat	I get hostname: Name or service not known  when I create a /etc/hostname
2010-05-16T12:24:00.000Z	wildbat	willberg	just reboot
2010-05-16T12:24:00.000Z	willberg	wildbat	I did :-)
2010-05-16T12:24:00.000Z	wildbat	willberg	your hostname should changed
2010-05-16T12:27:00.000Z	wildbat	willberg	creating it then reboot should do the job, no ?
2010-05-16T12:28:00.000Z	willberg	wildbat	That's what I thought! But nope!
2010-05-16T12:29:00.000Z	wildbat	willberg	no idea then ~
2010-05-16T12:29:00.000Z	wildbat	willberg	may be boot to recovery mode and try the process and see ~
2010-05-16T12:29:00.000Z	willberg	wildbat	Are there any particular permissions that need to be set on /etc/hostname?
2010-05-16T12:30:00.000Z	wildbat	willberg	root: root 644 in my box
2010-05-16T12:32:00.000Z	willberg	wildbat	This is so weird; the DNS is set nicely so that from the outside it resolves okay, i.e. using dig -x MY_IP I get the hostname I want
2010-05-16T12:33:00.000Z	wildbat	willberg	jsut try to change in single user mode w/o the net ~ and see
2010-05-16T12:33:00.000Z	willberg	wildbat	It's a VPS so I don't actually have physical access to the machine XD
2010-05-16T12:35:00.000Z	wildbat	willberg	ochie ~ no idea ~ sorry, let me know if you have a fix i would love to know~
2010-05-16T12:41:00.000Z	willberg	wildbat	Thanks for you help, I think I may have fixed it - weird issues with the format of /etc/hosts and fully qualified domain names
2010-05-16T12:48:00.000Z	wildbat	willberg	so you fix that? just wrong format in hosts @@?
2010-05-16T12:51:00.000Z	willberg	wildbat	Yep! The /etc/hosts was in one particular format when the machine was first installed; so I continued to use that format  (IP HOSTNAME) but I needed it in (IP FULLY_QUALIFIED_HOSTNAME HOSTNAME) format
