2009-08-16T00:56:00.000Z	gwildor	ActionParsnip	also sudo mv
2009-08-28T00:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gwildor	gksudo gedit dude, sudo is not to be used with gui apps]
2009-08-28T00:57:00.000Z	gwildor	ActionParsnip	sorry, ill never use gksudo, nor aptitude... gksudo has its place, and its not launching form cli
2009-08-28T00:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gwildor	gksudo is for running gui apps from cli giving them elevated priveledges. sudo does not setup the environment correctly and is ONLY for cli commands
2009-08-28T00:58:00.000Z	gwildor	ActionParsnip	people say that... but ive never had a problem...
2009-08-28T00:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gwildor	if yuo use sudo for gui apps you can and will garbage file ownerships
2009-08-28T00:58:00.000Z	gwildor	ActionParsnip	can you show me where and when this happens.... cuz iit doesnt here.

2009-08-28T00:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gwildor	i keep that link for people like you. Please stick to advised practises when advising users so yuo dont advise them how they can break their systems
2009-08-28T01:01:00.000Z	gwildor	ActionParsnip	im gonna go with gedit didnt cause that... nautilus maybe... and root nautilus is something i never recommend....ill stick with my good practice recomendation. thanks though.
2009-08-28T01:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gwildor	see how the users home dir is owned by root, thats what sudo with gui apps can do
2009-08-28T01:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gwildor	thanks :D
2009-08-28T01:02:00.000Z	gwildor	ActionParsnip	again, i wouldnt blame sudo.. id blame ....dumb decisions (we cant say stupid users here can we)
2009-08-28T01:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gwildor	never ;)
2009-08-28T01:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gwildor	hopefully not, they wont get too far
2009-08-28T01:04:00.000Z	gwildor	ActionParsnip	looks like nsp is... and like 3 days last week there was this guy ...screaming at me....too bad they didnt get it working..
2009-08-28T01:11:00.000Z	gwildor	ActionParsnip	i guess they have a hub involved...
2009-08-28T01:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gwildor	hub uses patch still, unless you have an uplink port which uses crossover
2009-08-28T01:13:00.000Z	gwildor	ActionParsnip	yeah, i was just saying ... they dont need a corssover, in this case.
2009-08-28T01:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gwildor	indeed
