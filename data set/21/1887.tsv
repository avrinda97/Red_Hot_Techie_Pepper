2011-01-23T23:54:00.000Z	magicianlord		how come vlc 1.06 has bugs, but it is still the latest version of vlc available in the supposd LTS ubuntu 10.04?
2011-01-23T23:55:00.000Z	magicianlord		no
2011-01-23T23:56:00.000Z	quiescens	magicianlord	what bugs specifically? releases generally do not receive version updates
2011-01-23T23:58:00.000Z	quiescens	magicianlord	bug fixes that are applicable and significant enough are usually applied to whatever version was part of the release in question without the rest of the changes where possible
2011-01-24T00:10:00.000Z	magicianlord	quiescens	i think the security support logic needs to be reevaluated if the vlc team says it's improper
2011-01-24T00:15:00.000Z	quiescens	magicianlord	i don't know the specifics, and i don't see any specific reference to security issues, just that it is out of date
2011-01-24T00:16:00.000Z	magicianlord	quiescens	they say on the site that it's not proper security support
2011-01-24T00:20:00.000Z	quiescens	magicianlord	if there is a specific known issue you could check whether it has been dealt with, but a generic comment from one side or the other isn't going to help matters
2011-01-24T00:20:00.000Z	magicianlord	quiescens	understand
2011-01-24T00:35:00.000Z	quiescens	magicianlord	1.1.5 is in natty, ubuntu's policy is not to update releases from one to another, bugfixes are backported when applicable and possible, if this isn't enough for you, you'll have to update manually from a different source, or something to that effect
2011-01-24T00:36:00.000Z	quiescens	magicianlord	do you have a specific security fix that has not been backported to the 1.1.4 which is currently in 10.10?
2011-01-24T00:36:00.000Z	magicianlord	quiescens	i didnt read all of it. but hte shoutcast thing is one
2011-01-24T00:42:00.000Z	quiescens	magicianlord	i still don't know which issue you're talking about
2011-01-24T00:46:00.000Z	quiescens	magicianlord	because 8.04 is still supported for another year after 10.04 is out
2011-01-24T00:48:00.000Z	magicianlord	quiescens	thanks. ok. i thought the support for the old one stopped
2011-01-24T00:50:00.000Z	quiescens	magicianlord	as far as 1.1.5, the only security fix listed on http://www.videolan.org/developers/vlc-branch/NEWS for 1.1.4.1->1.1.5 is a Windows crash VideoLAN-SA-1006
2011-01-24T00:51:00.000Z	magicianlord	quiescens	ok. is it safe to install vlc 1.1.5 onto 10.04 the way they say on the website? i just did it from terminal and its working, but for future?
2011-01-24T00:53:00.000Z	quiescens	magicianlord	on top of that, VideoLAN-SA-1007 which is slated for 1.1.6 (which is technically not out yet), has been fixed in 10.04's 1.0.6 as well as 10.10's 1.1.4
2011-01-24T00:54:00.000Z	magicianlord	quiescens	my issue with 1.06 was shoutcast doesn work anymroe, so i upped it to 1.1.5. unless there is a way to remove that plugin and add icecast to it
2011-01-24T00:54:00.000Z	quiescens	magicianlord	i wasn't aware shoutcast was reenabled even in 1.1.5
2011-01-24T00:56:00.000Z	magicianlord	quiescens	it isnt reenabled. its just replaced by icecast and shoutcast is removed. i dont know ow toremove shoutcast plugin from 1.0.6 and add icecast. if i did, i wouldnt needto upgrade to 1.1.5
