2012-08-30T04:27:00.000Z	sumpter		Hey everyone
2012-08-30T04:28:00.000Z	sumpter		umm I may have deleted all my kernels
2012-08-30T04:28:00.000Z	sumpter		and I can't seem to fix it
2012-08-30T04:28:00.000Z	sumpter		can anyone assist?
2012-08-30T04:30:00.000Z	sumpter		can anyone help me get a kernel again?
2012-08-30T04:30:00.000Z	sumpter		ive tried online guides, but they don't seem to be working
2012-08-30T04:30:00.000Z	Ben64	sumpter	what did you do to cause the issue?
2012-08-30T04:31:00.000Z	Ben64	sumpter	how
2012-08-30T04:31:00.000Z	sumpter	Ben64	I was being careless and used the Software Center to install the latest kernel for 12.04
2012-08-30T04:32:00.000Z	Ben64	sumpter	that wouldn't cause a problem
2012-08-30T04:32:00.000Z	sumpter	Ben64	I had a few glitches, so i then proceeded to uninstall the kernel
2012-08-30T04:33:00.000Z	sumpter	Ben64	that's what messed it up
2012-08-30T04:33:00.000Z	Ben64	sumpter	can you choose a different kernel
2012-08-30T04:33:00.000Z	sumpter	Ben64	I'm using Burg
2012-08-30T04:35:00.000Z	sumpter	Ben64	Idk how to select a different kernel in burg, or how to get grub back
2012-08-30T04:35:00.000Z	Ben64	sumpter	i've never heard of burg before, so i'm not sure either
2012-08-30T04:36:00.000Z	sumpter	Ben64	I'm in LiveCD now though, is there anything I can do to fix the kernel
2012-08-30T04:36:00.000Z	Ben64	sumpter	yes, but i don't know the exact steps. it involves mounting your system on the livecd and using apt to install the kernel(s)
2012-08-30T04:37:00.000Z	sumpter	Ben64	Yeah I've done that, but I'm getting apt error code 1 on everything to do with apt
2012-08-30T04:43:00.000Z	sumpter	Ben64	Okay, I still have the kernel, but it says it's not configured yet
2012-08-30T04:44:00.000Z	sumpter	Ben64	How do I configure the kernel?
