2009-07-06T10:25:00.000Z	SmoKeyCastle		The actual problem is not IP address related. The issue is that after changing my mac address in linux I suddenly become unable to establish a connection or session with my wireless access point.
2009-07-06T10:25:00.000Z	SmoKeyCastle		The router is owned by me
2009-07-06T10:25:00.000Z	SmoKeyCastle		I cannot even connect to the router and get an IP address
2009-07-06T10:25:00.000Z	SmoKeyCastle		I bring the wifi device down using ifconfig, change the mac, then bring the device back up using ifconfig
2009-07-06T10:26:00.000Z	SmoKeyCastle		then try to connect, no luck
2009-07-06T10:26:00.000Z	SmoKeyCastle		is there some logs somewhere that show me how far in the connection i was able to get?
2009-07-06T10:26:00.000Z	SmoKeyCastle		i want to connect to the wireless router after i have changed my mac
2009-07-06T10:26:00.000Z	SmoKeyCastle		currently i cannot connect to the router.
2009-07-06T10:26:00.000Z	SmoKeyCastle		the router is owned by me
2009-07-06T10:27:00.000Z	SmoKeyCastle		you asked me to do that before, i spent 15 mins afterwards re inputting the config
2009-07-06T10:29:00.000Z	C-S-B	SmoKeyCastle	is there a device that shares the mac of the one you are changing your card to?
2009-07-06T10:30:00.000Z	C-S-B	SmoKeyCastle	is there a device that shares the mac of the one you are changing your card to?
2009-07-06T10:31:00.000Z	C-S-B	SmoKeyCastle	is that machine turned off?
2009-07-06T10:34:00.000Z	C-S-B	SmoKeyCastle	what if you try a mac that is not your work laptops, can you connect then?
2009-07-06T10:34:00.000Z	C-S-B	SmoKeyCastle	as in a completely made up mac
2009-07-06T10:38:00.000Z	C-S-B	SmoKeyCastle	well?
2009-07-06T10:39:00.000Z	C-S-B	SmoKeyCastle	looks like its a problem with the state your card is in after changing the mac...
2009-07-06T10:40:00.000Z	C-S-B	SmoKeyCastle	what chipset?
2009-07-06T10:47:00.000Z	C-S-B	SmoKeyCastle	i dont know if it resets the mac, but you could try sudo service networking restart as well
2009-07-06T11:02:00.000Z	SmoKeyCastle	C-S-B	Can i send you a private message with the data that i collected from that attempt, it is a bit big to spam the channel with
2009-07-06T11:02:00.000Z	C-S-B	SmoKeyCastle	my pm is all yours...
