2011-04-29T03:30:00.000Z	Soothsayer		if I cancel the ubuntu upgrade to 11 from within 10.10, can I resume it later?
2011-04-29T03:30:00.000Z	Soothsayer		its too slow at the moment.
2011-04-29T03:31:00.000Z	jrib	Soothsayer	if it's only at the download stage, it's ok
2011-04-29T03:31:00.000Z	Soothsayer	jrib	but I will lose everything I've downloaded so far right? :-(
2011-04-29T03:31:00.000Z	jrib	Soothsayer	no
2011-04-29T03:32:00.000Z	Soothsayer	jrib	oh, that's nice then.. its in the "Getting new packages" page.. its already fetched some 150 packages.
2011-04-29T15:57:00.000Z	jrib	Soothsayer	what card?
2011-04-29T16:00:00.000Z	jrib	Soothsayer	do you know what video card you have?
2011-04-29T17:42:00.000Z	jrib	Soothsayer	nautilus-open-terminal
2011-04-29T18:50:00.000Z	jrib	Soothsayer	the user you created during install is in the admin group which can sudo by default
2011-04-30T17:20:00.000Z	jrib	Soothsayer	/opt/cyberoam/crclient/foo
2011-04-30T17:20:00.000Z	Soothsayer	jrib	./crclient: You can run the executable with name `crclient' only.
2011-04-30T17:21:00.000Z	Soothsayer	jrib	in my case foo = crclient (the executable is the same name as the directory holdign it)
2011-08-14T11:52:00.000Z	Soothsayer	jrib	when I do a ./foo
2011-08-14T11:53:00.000Z	jrib	Soothsayer	first issue is your ^M at the end of the line, second is that you probably want php5 (not sure on this; check that you have /usr/bin/php)
2011-08-14T11:57:00.000Z	jrib	Soothsayer	when I said "you want php5", I meant "/usr/bin/php5" instead of "/usr/bin/php" by the way
2011-08-14T11:58:00.000Z	jrib	Soothsayer	^M in your output
2011-08-14T12:00:00.000Z	jrib	Soothsayer	ah, php5-cli.postinst sets up /usr/bin/php with alternatives :D
2011-08-14T12:02:00.000Z	Soothsayer	jrib	oh c'mon, not the language war again.
2011-08-14T12:03:00.000Z	jrib	Soothsayer	just kidding around
2011-08-14T12:03:00.000Z	Soothsayer	jrib	hehe. well I've been a Java, C# and PHP developer in my life. I think php works well. Never seen it become a bottleneck _yet_.
