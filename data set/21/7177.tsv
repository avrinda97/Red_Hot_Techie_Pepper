2007-01-27T17:43:00.000Z	grndslm_		anybody know how to play bin/cue movies straight from the hd instead of burning them to disc??
2007-01-27T17:43:00.000Z	Slart	grndslm_	you could always mount them using mount -loop something
2007-01-27T17:44:00.000Z	grndslm_	Slart	 and then play them with...?
2007-01-27T17:44:00.000Z	Slart	grndslm_	but you'd have to convert them into a iso-file first.. but that's pretty easy with bchunk
2007-01-27T17:44:00.000Z	Slart	grndslm_	well.. whatever software you'd play a normal disk with
2007-01-27T17:44:00.000Z	Slart	grndslm_	I'm guessing vlc, or mplayer.. or.. any of the regular ones
2007-01-27T17:44:00.000Z	grndslm_	Slart	 so use bchunk, then mount and it'll play in most any video player with the right codecs
2007-01-27T17:45:00.000Z	Slart	grndslm_	I suppose so.. haven't tried it with movie-disks myself.. but I have tried it with games
2007-01-27T17:48:00.000Z	grndslm_	Slart	 gnome display manager actually
2007-01-27T17:52:00.000Z	grndslm_	Slart	 now I have 2 isos and the largest one isn't working with the mount command
2007-01-27T17:53:00.000Z	Slart	grndslm_	isn't working? any errors?
2007-01-27T17:53:00.000Z	Slart	grndslm_	there are some options to bchunk.. like I said.. I've never tried it on movies..
2007-01-27T17:53:00.000Z	grndslm_	Slart	 mount -tiso9660 -o loop condorman.iso02.iso movie/
2007-01-27T17:54:00.000Z	grndslm_	Slart	 nevermind, the space after the -t switch still gives that same "wrong fs type" error
2007-01-27T17:55:00.000Z	Slart	grndslm_	 is it a DVD ? or a CD?
2007-01-27T17:55:00.000Z	Slart	grndslm_	also.. try it using sudo
2007-01-27T17:56:00.000Z	grndslm_	Slart	 already root
2007-01-27T17:57:00.000Z	Slart	grndslm_	hold on.. I'll see if I have any movies to try it with
2007-01-27T17:57:00.000Z	Slart	grndslm_	is it a full DVD? or some compressed thing?
2007-01-27T17:57:00.000Z	grndslm_	Slart	 dvd rip that was compressed to svcd
2007-01-27T06:01:00.000Z	Slart	grndslm_	hmm.. seems I don't have any bin/cue movies.. they are all avi's...
