2007-10-23T14:12:00.000Z	esjay-afk		Do most of you just use the default network connection icon in the upper right hand corner when trying to connect to wireless networks or is there a better one?
2007-10-23T14:12:00.000Z	ozzloy	esjay-afk	i use the icon
2007-10-23T14:12:00.000Z	ozzloy	esjay-afk	what problem you having?
2007-10-23T14:13:00.000Z	esjay-afk		no problem really...just wondered if there was a better tool...this doesn't tell me any detailed info on the actual networks
2007-10-23T14:13:00.000Z	esjay-afk		or..maybe it does and i don't know how to view it
2007-10-23T14:14:00.000Z	esjay-afk		especially on the wifi connections that have the two pc icon in front of them...i can't seem to connect to any of those whereas I can if i'm in windows
2007-10-23T14:14:00.000Z	ozzloy	esjay-afk	those are other people's computers set to master mode
2007-10-23T14:14:00.000Z	esjay-afk		i know the card is working well though because i can connect to my wpa security enabled wifi with 0 issues
2007-10-23T14:14:00.000Z	esjay-afk		k that's what i thought ozzloy..
2007-10-23T14:14:00.000Z	esjay-afk		and when it's blank before the signal strength those are unsecured?
2007-10-23T14:14:00.000Z	ozzloy	esjay-afk	usually you don't want to connect to the internet through them
2007-10-23T14:15:00.000Z	ozzloy	esjay-afk	yes, blank means no wpa
2007-10-23T14:16:00.000Z	esjay-afk	ozzloy	thanks...now i just need to find an open one to fool around on :)
2007-10-23T14:16:00.000Z	ozzloy	esjay-afk	if you want more detailed info, look into iwlist
2007-10-23T14:17:00.000Z	ozzloy	esjay-afk	you can at the command line type iwconfig
2007-10-23T14:17:00.000Z	ozzloy	esjay-afk	that will give you the name of your wireless card
2007-10-23T14:17:00.000Z	ozzloy	esjay-afk	likely eth1 or eth0 or something similar
2007-10-23T14:18:00.000Z	ozzloy	esjay-afk	then type: iwlist eth1 scan
2007-10-23T14:18:00.000Z	ozzloy		and it will print out a list of access points visible to eth1 (if that's your wireless card)
2007-10-23T14:19:00.000Z	esjay-afk	ozzloy	thanks again
2007-10-23T14:20:00.000Z	ozzloy	esjay-afk	np!  glad to help
