2010-11-16T20:14:00.000Z	DarkStar1	sosaited	:D Each system had its use. I use Windows 7 and ubuntu on my Desktop and currently chatting to you on a snow tiger laptop
2010-11-16T20:15:00.000Z	sosaited	DarkStar1	You are telling me you can't chat from a ubuntu machine ? ;)
2010-11-16T20:16:00.000Z	DarkStar1	sosaited	:D lolz.. No.. I'm just telling you that there's no need to abandon a system. I'm just not at home at the moment
2010-11-16T20:16:00.000Z	sosaited	DarkStar1	One thing I can see is for hardcore gamers yearning for more FPS on latest hardware and games.
2010-11-16T20:17:00.000Z	sosaited	DarkStar1	I haven't been much of a fan of Microsoft lately, especially after Steve Ballmer came. And I honestly didn't find any reason to run my Windows for ages. But like I said, if I needed to play some new game, I might *have* to use it.
2010-11-16T20:18:00.000Z	DarkStar1	sosaited	Yeah. Well that demand's always been there. Used to be a hardcore gamer meself, but now I'm a conscious gamer. (or as a friend put it, a Hippie gamer)
2010-11-16T20:19:00.000Z	sosaited	DarkStar1	The last game I played was an online text based multiplayer space colonization related game. Before that .. ages ago... it was NFS most wanted.
2010-11-16T20:19:00.000Z	DarkStar1	sosaited	I actually gave up trying to figure out why an old struts 2 app wont deploy on tomcat on my ubuntu machine the other that (using eclipse) after about an hour of trying. Switched to windows and deployed the same app in seconds
2010-11-16T20:20:00.000Z	DarkStar1	sosaited	after which I then copied the war back unto my ubuntu server which ran it. Sometimes I just cba to spend ages figuring out a problem when windows will do my "idiot thinking" for me :D
2010-11-16T20:21:00.000Z	DarkStar1	sosaited	BTW respect on NFSMW. I still haven't found the time to complete it on my Gamecube :D
2010-11-16T20:22:00.000Z	DarkStar1	sosaited	I keep getting humped by the pigs at the ending... Brutual
2010-11-16T20:22:00.000Z	sosaited	DarkStar1	Well that is not as much of Ubuntu's fault as the problem of most stuff written for Windows platform you know. Like I said, there are things for which you need Windows... but I personally haven't needed to for a while. Heck man I even abandoned 50 or so small scripts/programs I made to easy my life in Xp (automation and related stuff in C++)...
2010-11-16T20:23:00.000Z	sosaited	DarkStar1	Oh man the last guy was tricky. For some reason I couldn't find the way I had to go to ... LOL.
2010-11-16T20:24:00.000Z	sosaited	DarkStar1	I am a Mafia fan and had been anxiously waiting for Mafia 2 to come, but too bad my system isn't powerful enough to run it , otherwise I would have had to go to Windows.
2010-11-16T20:24:00.000Z	DarkStar1	sosaited	Keep teh windowz skillz alive mon.. I aced the last guy no problem just trying to get away from the police so I can exit the city is a big problem
2010-11-16T20:25:00.000Z	DarkStar1	sosaited	I'm an EvE Online and Warcrack fan :)
2010-11-16T20:27:00.000Z	sosaited	DarkStar1	Yeah I guess I should.. The game I used to play was "Astroempires".. and its basic theme was related to Eve.. and I even tried it for a few days.. but didn't got into it for some reason. I really liked it though.
2010-11-16T20:28:00.000Z	sosaited	DarkStar1	Did you Warcraft?
2010-11-16T20:28:00.000Z	DarkStar1	sosaited	7 lvl 80 characters. 6 well geared :D
2010-11-16T20:29:00.000Z	DarkStar1	sosaited	but I've taken a break now for the better part of a year. Now I just play EvE
2010-11-16T20:30:00.000Z	sosaited	DarkStar1	Nice. And I am sure you are upgraded on EVE?. How much is it nowadays?
