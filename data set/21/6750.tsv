2007-02-05T12:04:00.000Z	lordkeiden		well, i RTFM, installed network manager, and it works like it should... no breakage.  =-(
2007-02-05T12:05:00.000Z	lordkeiden		i even have an acurate signal indicator now....
2007-02-05T12:05:00.000Z	lordkeiden		there was no way I had 100% signal at 300ft from the router!
2007-02-05T12:06:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	lordkeiden	I can :)
2007-02-05T12:06:00.000Z	lordkeiden	tonyyarusso	how do u pull that off?
2007-02-05T12:07:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	lordkeiden	DD-WRT on a Linksys WRT54GL, which lets me set the broadcast strength
2007-02-05T12:07:00.000Z	lordkeiden	tonyyarusso	u can set it highter that it shipped with?
2007-02-05T12:08:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	lordkeiden	yes.  Much.  (with safety warning about leaving it as such)
2007-02-05T12:08:00.000Z	lordkeiden	tonyyarusso	is dd-wrt a linux app? never heard of it.
2007-02-05T12:09:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	lordkeiden	It's router firmware.
2007-02-05T12:09:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	lordkeiden	http://www.dd-wrt.com/dd-wrtv2/index.php
2007-02-05T12:10:00.000Z	lordkeiden	tonyyarusso	is the router a current model? this is Exactly what I need for a client of mine...
2007-02-05T12:11:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	lordkeiden	Yes.  Note carefully the L at the end of the model name - that is critical.
2007-02-05T12:12:00.000Z	lordkeiden	tonyyarusso	thanks so much. u have noooo idea how helpful that little tidbit is ti me!!
2007-02-05T12:17:00.000Z	lordkeiden	tonyyarusso	is it reasonable to want to get 600ft thru 2 residentian walls, no metal siding?
2007-02-05T12:18:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	lordkeiden	that might be pushing it, but it's worth a try.
2007-02-05T12:18:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	lordkeiden	a repeater would be smarter
2007-02-05T12:20:00.000Z	lordkeiden	tonyyarusso	problem is theres nowhere to put one in that distance. trying to connect a church, school, and parsonage (pastors house) together...
2007-02-05T12:20:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	lordkeiden	Eeep.
2007-02-05T12:20:00.000Z	lordkeiden	tonyyarusso	eeep?
2007-02-05T12:21:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	lordkeiden	That sounds pretty tricky.  Can you run wires underground to connect them?
