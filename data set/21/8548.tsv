2006-03-23T11:40:00.000Z	bigfoot1		how do i know if i need more RAM?
2006-03-23T11:40:00.000Z	bigfoot1		Will increasing my Virtual Memory make my computer run smoother?
2006-03-23T11:40:00.000Z	volmarias	bigfoot1	no
2006-03-23T11:42:00.000Z	bigfoot1		i'd like to make my old computer run more smoothly. So i'm thinking of having less programs running at one time. In system-monitor, how do i know which program don't need to be running?
2006-03-23T11:43:00.000Z	volmarias	bigfoot1	google them.
2006-03-23T11:43:00.000Z	volmarias		If it sounds important, leave it alone.
2006-03-23T11:43:00.000Z	volmarias		If it doesn't sound important, kill it.
2006-03-23T11:43:00.000Z	volmarias		If your computer dies suddenly, keep it next time
2006-03-23T11:44:00.000Z	volmarias		Anyway, so no one has any experience with knockd? Can anyone suggest where I should ask?
2006-03-23T11:45:00.000Z	bigfoot1		How come "memory" and "virtual memorY" for all programs are the same?
2006-03-23T11:46:00.000Z	volmarias	bigfoot1	google "virtual memory"
2006-03-23T11:46:00.000Z	volmarias		that'll do a good job explaining it
2006-03-23T11:47:00.000Z	bigfoot1		http://reiber.org/drupal/node/33 says increasing VMwill help the computer. but you say no. i'm confused
2006-03-23T11:48:00.000Z	bigfoot1		how do i know how much ram i have?
2006-03-23T11:48:00.000Z	bigfoot1		and how do i know how much more ram i should get?
2006-03-23T11:49:00.000Z	volmarias	bigfoot1	type "top" at console
2006-03-23T11:49:00.000Z	volmarias		that provides some useful information, including how much memory you have, and what your VM limit is set to
2006-03-23T11:50:00.000Z	bigfoot1	volmarias	ok. i did top. i think i have 256 mb. how do i know how much more ram i should get?
2006-03-23T11:51:00.000Z	volmarias	bigfoot1	how much ram you SHOULD get is up to you. I'd suggest 512MB min. If you don't know how much memory your machine supports, ask your manufacturer. They usually have information on each model online
2006-03-23T11:51:00.000Z	volmarias		alternately, figure out what motherboard you have, and look that up.
2006-03-23T11:53:00.000Z	bigfoot1	volmarias	i'm just wondering whether there's such a thing as too much RAM.
