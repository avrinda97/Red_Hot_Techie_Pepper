2008-09-07T02:47:00.000Z	jin		hi, where can I download a ffmpeg version with x264 support for Ubuntu?
2008-09-07T02:48:00.000Z	jrib	jin	medibuntu
2008-09-07T02:51:00.000Z	jrib	jin	use the package from medibuntu
2008-09-19T02:31:00.000Z	jrib	jin	-generic will use both cores already
2008-10-17T02:22:00.000Z	jrib	jin	taamodt: flash works fine on 64bit
2008-10-17T02:23:00.000Z	jin	jrib	I think that's a workaround to make it work, there is no official 64bit release of flash for Linux
2008-10-17T02:24:00.000Z	jrib	jin	you're right that adobe doesn't help, but nspluginwrapper can be used (and installing flashplugin-nonfree on 64bit automatically sets that up)
2008-10-17T02:24:00.000Z	jin	jrib	do you get the same performance as flash 10 32bit?
2008-10-17T02:25:00.000Z	jrib	jin	I haven't bothered with flash 10
2008-10-17T02:25:00.000Z	jin	jrib	flash 10 is a big step forward compared to 9.
2008-10-17T02:25:00.000Z	jrib	jin	flash is one big step backward imo
2008-10-17T02:25:00.000Z	jin	jrib	try flash 10 ;)
2008-11-19T03:24:00.000Z	jrib	jin	what is it missing?
2008-11-19T03:24:00.000Z	jin	jrib	I don't like its interface
2008-11-19T03:52:00.000Z	jrib	jin	gimp is nice :)
2008-11-19T03:52:00.000Z	jrib	jin	if you want to do vector graphics, try inkscape
2010-09-01T22:36:00.000Z	jrib	jin	the usplash them you mean?
2010-09-01T22:38:00.000Z	jrib	jin	the usplash them you mean?
