2010-05-20T06:04:00.000Z	Squarism		how do i write a /bin/sh function that takes a file and does a sed replace on it?
2010-05-20T06:06:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Squarism	hi. you know what the bash 'shebang' is?
2010-05-20T06:06:00.000Z	Squarism	onetinsoldier	#!/bin/sh ?
2010-05-20T06:07:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Squarism	either one will work
2010-05-20T06:08:00.000Z	Squarism	onetinsoldier	But how do i write that function?
2010-05-20T06:09:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Squarism	now you just put in the sed command
2010-05-20T06:09:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Squarism	you know what you want for your sed command?
2010-05-20T06:10:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Squarism	we shold join #bash
2010-05-20T06:10:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Squarism	we should* join #bash
2010-05-31T10:03:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Squarism	not sure, but perhaps you're looking for  /usr/bin/rename.ul
2010-05-31T10:03:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Squarism	bah, that's probably not it
2010-05-31T10:04:00.000Z	Squarism	onetinsoldier	ok.. ill try it it
2010-05-31T10:04:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Squarism	yeah, worth a look i guess
2010-05-31T10:06:00.000Z	Squarism	onetinsoldier	What does it mean?
2010-05-31T10:07:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Squarism	means that /usr/bin/rename was installed by some script that came in package is my guess, and not by an actual package
2010-05-31T10:07:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Squarism	and of course, i would guess it would be a perl script
2010-05-31T10:08:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Squarism	i let out *not*
2010-05-31T10:08:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Squarism	means that /usr/bin/rename was *not* installed by some script that came in package is my guess, and not by an actual package
2010-05-31T10:09:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Squarism	nvm, i had it right the first time. i think it's bedtime for me, lol
2010-05-31T10:12:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Squarism	greezmunkey: ls -l /usr/bin/rename  -->  /usr/bin/rename -> /etc/alternatives/rename
2010-05-31T10:13:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Squarism	greezmunkey: ls -l /etc/alternatives/rename -> /usr/bin/prename
