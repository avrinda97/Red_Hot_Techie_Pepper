2007-05-11T09:36:00.000Z	swuboo		Anyone have any good ideas on how to use nvidia-settings to properly calibrate an LCD?

2007-05-11T09:37:00.000Z	dam	swuboo	what problems ave you got?
2007-05-11T09:39:00.000Z	swuboo	dam	 I'm awash in a sea of blazing white.
2007-05-11T09:39:00.000Z	swuboo	dam	 I just want a utility to help me get the gamma and contrast right, really.
2007-05-11T09:40:00.000Z	dam	swuboo	does your LCD have a auto mode?
2007-05-11T09:40:00.000Z	swuboo	dam	 The Windows version of the nvidia drivers had a whole wizard-doodad that got everything pretty much perfect.
2007-05-11T09:40:00.000Z	swuboo	dam	 Auto in what sense?
2007-05-11T09:40:00.000Z	dam	swuboo	'nvidia-settings' has all the right settings for changing those values.
2007-05-11T09:41:00.000Z	swuboo	dam	 I know, I found them.  But do you know of any utilities or walkthroughs for setting them to the right values?  I'm rather a neophyte with LCD's.
2007-05-11T09:41:00.000Z	dam	swuboo	buttons on the monitor that allow you to change settings. usally a auto or default button exists!
2007-05-11T09:41:00.000Z	dam	swuboo	turn them all down.
2007-05-11T09:41:00.000Z	swuboo	dam	 Ah, yes.  My monitor is currently set to its default.
2007-05-11T09:41:00.000Z	swuboo	dam	 Right, well I'll give that a go then.
2007-05-11T09:42:00.000Z	swuboo	dam	 That works, but there's no ready way to do arrange a proper calibration?
2007-05-11T09:44:00.000Z	dam	swuboo	is there a default settings button in the nvidia settings page?
2007-05-11T09:44:00.000Z	swuboo	dam	 Yes.  It makes my eyes bleed.
2007-05-11T09:45:00.000Z	dam	swuboo	ok. i would just play around with settings while looking at a famous logo with many colours. config it that way
2007-05-11T09:45:00.000Z	swuboo	dam	 Works for me, I guess.
