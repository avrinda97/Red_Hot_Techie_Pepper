2010-05-18T08:45:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	twiztid	oh.. roger. don't know if installing the latest bleeding edge version of it would help, but i have a link to a guide on how to do that
2010-05-18T08:45:00.000Z	twiztid	onetinsoldier	would love to try it, i think i have the xorgedgers installed; that the same thing er no?
2010-05-18T08:46:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	twiztid	i doubt it's the same thing, but i don't know. do you have a link to xorgedgers?

2010-05-18T08:47:00.000Z	twiztid	onetinsoldier	ya https://launchpad.net/~xorg-edgers/+archive/ppa
2010-05-18T08:49:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	twiztid	no... that's not the same thing as the latest ffmpeg and x264

2010-05-18T08:52:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	twiztid	that video played smooth here.. 360p
2010-05-18T08:52:00.000Z	twiztid	onetinsoldier	well thats good and bad at the same time... lol
2010-05-18T08:53:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	twiztid	how did you install flash? did you install 'flashplugin-installer'? what are your system specs?
2010-05-18T08:53:00.000Z	twiztid	onetinsoldier	i went to adobe flash, and it opened APT  and installed
2010-05-18T08:54:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	twiztid	what video card driver are you using? that might be what you need. you might need proprietary video driver
2010-05-18T08:55:00.000Z	twiztid	onetinsoldier	ati x1300 512mb agp card on, open source drivers with KMS enabled and indirect-rendering enabled
2010-05-18T08:56:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	twiztid	roger. i don't know if you system has enough horsepower or not. dugger5688 might be right. i have pci-e ati 4850 HD and using the ati fglrx driver here. direct rendering enabled
2010-05-18T08:57:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	twiztid	you said 'indirect' in your last post, but i assume you meant 'direct'... that you do have direct rendering enabled
2010-05-18T08:58:00.000Z	twiztid	onetinsoldier	hrm, ya for some weird reason, KMS + Compiz is very slow UNLESS a.)kms is disabled or b.)indirect-rendering is enabled... i need KMS so i have openGL cairo dock and compiz in harmony.... so now if i could just get flash running smooth, or at least better
2010-05-18T09:00:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	twiztid	i hear you. don't know how to help though really other than what i went over. you can try that link i gave for latest ffmep and x264 if you want --> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=786095
