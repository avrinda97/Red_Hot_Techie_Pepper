2006-06-04T13:23:00.000Z	facefacefaceface		I found that mp3 is not as clear under linux
2006-06-04T13:25:00.000Z	facefacefaceface		how do I find out my ubuntu version?
2006-06-04T13:26:00.000Z	mwe	facefacefaceface	lsb_release -a
2006-06-04T13:30:00.000Z	mwe	facefacefaceface	well 6.06 was released 3 days ago
2006-06-04T13:33:00.000Z	mwe	facefacefaceface	because of the perms
2006-06-04T13:33:00.000Z	mwe	facefacefaceface	ls -l / and you'll see
2006-06-04T13:33:00.000Z	facefacefaceface	mwe	OK, it is green for 'go - you have perms'
2006-06-04T13:34:00.000Z	mwe	facefacefaceface	well not exactly. it's because everyone has write access
2006-06-04T13:34:00.000Z	facefacefaceface	mwe	OK
2006-06-04T13:35:00.000Z	mwe	facefacefaceface	it should be world writeable on any system
2006-06-04T13:36:00.000Z	mwe	facefacefaceface	maybe the coloring is different though
2006-06-04T13:36:00.000Z	facefacefaceface	mwe	just wondered if tmp under ubunto did a clean up on reboot
2006-06-04T13:36:00.000Z	mwe	facefacefaceface	I don't think so by default
2006-06-04T13:38:00.000Z	mwe	facefacefaceface	well it does a partial clean up at boot, deleting old files
2006-06-04T13:38:00.000Z	facefacefaceface	mwe	it was written today
2006-06-04T13:43:00.000Z	mwe	facefacefaceface	try. and read 'man locate' for details
2006-06-04T13:47:00.000Z	mwe	facefacefaceface	type mount
2006-06-04T13:47:00.000Z	mwe	facefacefaceface	or fdisk -l
2006-06-04T13:55:00.000Z	facefacefaceface	mwe	say again?
2006-06-04T13:56:00.000Z	facefacefaceface	mwe	crazy
2006-06-04T13:59:00.000Z	facefacefaceface	mwe	aptitude vs. synaptic?
