2010-11-02T08:11:00.000Z	radhruin		dli/adrock2: the drive also has 12gb or so free space remaining.
2010-11-02T08:12:00.000Z	adrock2	radhruin	it's not a usb disk is it?
2010-11-02T08:12:00.000Z	radhruin	adrock2	no sir.
2010-11-02T08:12:00.000Z	radhruin	adrock2	yes, WD velociraptor that, up until this point, was blazing fast :)
2010-11-02T08:13:00.000Z	adrock2	radhruin	run 'vmstat 1' and let it go for a while, then paste
2010-11-02T08:13:00.000Z	radhruin	adrock2	what's a while? :)
2010-11-02T08:18:00.000Z	radhruin	adrock2	http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=fGkxXYw4. Right around when the headers were printed a second time, pidgin froze up.
2010-11-02T08:19:00.000Z	adrock2	radhruin	anything in dmesg output?
2010-11-02T08:20:00.000Z	radhruin	adrock2	/var/log/dmesg or someplace else?
2010-11-02T08:20:00.000Z	adrock2	radhruin	just type dmesg, it'll spit out the most recent messages
2010-11-02T08:21:00.000Z	adrock2	radhruin	also, have a gander at /var/log/messages and look for where the driver for the drive spits out messages.  it might be falling back to some weird slow/compatibility mode
2010-11-02T08:22:00.000Z	radhruin	adrock2	Checked that already, it's good.
2010-11-02T08:22:00.000Z	radhruin	adrock2	I tailed /var/log/dmesg, found nothing, but typing dmesg shows recent messages that seem relevant. Give me a second.
2010-11-02T08:22:00.000Z	adrock2	radhruin	if you're having disk problems, the file may lag the message buffer that is printed by dmesg

2010-11-02T08:23:00.000Z	adrock2	radhruin	yeah, that's bad.
2010-11-02T08:24:00.000Z	radhruin	adrock2	looks like a hardware problem eh? I'll try reseating the cable but otherwise... :(
2010-11-02T08:24:00.000Z	adrock2	radhruin	reseat the cable, maybe try a different cable or different port.
2010-11-02T08:24:00.000Z	radhruin	adrock2	I bet it's the cable. No way it could be this bad but SMART isn't complaining...
2010-11-02T08:25:00.000Z	radhruin	adrock2	great ideas. Thank you for your help! I learned something new: just type dmesg instead of tailing the log :) I owe you a beer!
2010-11-02T08:25:00.000Z	adrock2	radhruin	good luck!
