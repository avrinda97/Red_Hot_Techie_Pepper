2008-03-02T23:52:00.000Z	malocite	amenado	but its slow before the dialogue box comes up, once I can click shutdown its nice and fast, and normal, its just clicking on the red button to bring up that menu causes it to freeze :)

2008-03-03T00:03:00.000Z	malocite	amenado	Actually, I went all through that and nothing seemed to be unusual, the whole system was just always sluggish.... I'm hoping to pay closer attention this time around
