2009-12-28T14:45:00.000Z	pavel_		I run 9.10 with alsa & pulseaudio but can get any sound out of my speakers, please can onyone help?
2009-12-28T14:46:00.000Z	mka	pavel_	stick to alsa, get away from pulseaudio
2009-12-28T14:46:00.000Z	pavel_	mka	just purge pulseaudio?
2009-12-28T14:46:00.000Z	mka	pavel_	no SELECT alsa
2009-12-28T14:47:00.000Z	mka	pavel_	ALT_F2 then type gnome-sound-properties and ENTER
2009-12-28T14:47:00.000Z	pavel_	mka	there are no devices marked ALSA in hw selection
2009-12-28T14:48:00.000Z	pavel_	mka	no such a command or app...
2009-12-28T14:56:00.000Z	pavel_	mka	sorry to bother you again, but what should I do when I can not see any alsa devices in sound properties dialog
2009-12-28T14:57:00.000Z	mka	pavel_	you mean ALSA is not appearing under available sound systems?
2009-12-28T14:58:00.000Z	mka	pavel_	there should be at least ALSA, PulseAudio, OSS available there
2009-12-28T14:59:00.000Z	pavel_	mka	I am not sure whethe we talk about the same dialog: I right.-click the volume icon in panel and choose sound properties
2009-12-28T15:01:00.000Z	mka	pavel_	no we talk about different stuffs
2009-12-28T15:01:00.000Z	mka	pavel_	ALT_F2 and then run gnome-sound-properties
2009-12-28T15:01:00.000Z	mka	pavel_	or equivalently, System > Preferences > Sound
2009-12-28T15:02:00.000Z	pavel_	mka	theres no such a thing as gnome-sound-properties on my system, neither installable package that name
2009-12-28T15:02:00.000Z	pavel_	mka	yes I am there
2009-12-28T15:02:00.000Z	mka	pavel_	hmmmm, I am on intrepid, I am not sure what had replaced this then
2009-12-28T15:03:00.000Z	mka	pavel_	you are on karmic, am I right?
2009-12-28T15:03:00.000Z	pavel_	mka	ok nevermind, yep I am on KK
2009-12-28T15:04:00.000Z	pavel_	mka	theres is a second card in sound properties  dialog and there I can choose device, but there is no ALSA, no Pulse or OSS
