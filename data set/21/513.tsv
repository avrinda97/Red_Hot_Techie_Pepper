2011-11-01T17:27:00.000Z	cgrs		plz someone knows how to start ubuntu without unity, and use gnome instead?
2011-11-01T17:28:00.000Z	glebihan	cgrs	which version of ubuntu are you running ?
2011-11-01T17:28:00.000Z	cgrs	glebihan	11.10
2011-11-01T17:29:00.000Z	cgrs		ive got oneiric (11.10)
2011-11-01T17:30:00.000Z	glebihan	cgrs	in that case, there isn't gnome2 anymore. If you don't like unity, you can try gnome-shell or another desktop environment (kde, xfce, lxde...)
2011-11-01T17:30:00.000Z	cgrs		ok, then i'll return to 10.04, thanx !
2011-11-01T17:31:00.000Z	cgrs		but, unity and gnome3 are the same???
2011-11-01T17:31:00.000Z	cgrs		whats the difference???
2011-11-01T17:32:00.000Z	cgrs		oh, i know, but how can i return to gnome2 in 11.10??
2011-11-01T17:32:00.000Z	cgrs		ok!!!
2011-11-01T17:32:00.000Z	cgrs		thanx
2011-11-01T17:32:00.000Z	glebihan	cgrs	you can't
2011-11-01T17:32:00.000Z	cgrs		ok
2011-11-01T17:34:00.000Z	cgrs		gnome 3 "gnome-shell" is like gnome2 ui??
2011-11-01T17:35:00.000Z	cgrs		oh, then its like unity 2d, right?
2011-11-01T17:36:00.000Z	cgrs		but in my version it shows only "Unity" and "Unity 2d"
2011-11-01T17:37:00.000Z	cgrs		there is no classic mode :(
2011-11-01T17:37:00.000Z	glebihan	cgrs	gnome-shell is very different from both gnome2 and unity. The only way to get a gnome2-like interface on oneiric is to use gnome-panel+gnome-session-fallback (but it won't have as many functionalities as gnome-panel in gnome2 and is only intended as a fallback)
2011-11-01T17:37:00.000Z	cgrs		yes, then i use ubuntu 11.04 with Classic mode??
2011-11-01T17:38:00.000Z	cgrs		ok
2011-11-01T17:38:00.000Z	glebihan	cgrs	you can. But keep in mind that gnome2 is heading to the end of its life
