2006-09-13T11:56:00.000Z	total_meltdown		yeah - I think Microsoft-only programs are a creation of the devil. Don't get me wrong, Valve is great and HL2 rocks my face, but ffs, it's not that difficult...
2006-09-13T11:57:00.000Z	britt	total_meltdown	and somebody would make a killing producing nice linux games
2006-09-13T12:01:00.000Z	britt	total_meltdown	true, i love vi
2006-09-13T12:03:00.000Z	total_meltdown	britt	I could actually see Apple taking over the hotseat
2006-09-13T12:04:00.000Z	britt	total_meltdown	that would be nice, I feel like them going to Intel kinda messed things up a bit though
2006-09-13T12:05:00.000Z	britt	total_meltdown	I actually use vintage mac hardware, a 603e CPU and a overclocked G3 processor running 7.6.1
2006-09-13T12:10:00.000Z	britt	total_meltdown	yeah, i also have a Pismo, its in pieces though. And a 2400c and a 2300c Duo and a Thinkpad i series and a Compaq Presario notebook....
2006-09-13T12:11:00.000Z	total_meltdown	britt	I have a Gateway laptop with Linux (1.5 Ghz Celeron, 512 MB ram), a Desktop with Windows (Games only) and 3 old 133 Mhz PCs that I use as project computers. Right now they're unsucessfully trying to play nice together and be a cluster...
2006-09-13T12:11:00.000Z	britt	total_meltdown	a cluster :o
2006-09-13T12:11:00.000Z	total_meltdown	britt	kinda
2006-09-13T12:12:00.000Z	britt	total_meltdown	wow, was that really hard to setup? Is it actually spreading out processes, like SMP or what?
2006-09-13T12:12:00.000Z	total_meltdown	britt	I asked that earlier - I wanna try to get OpenMosix running on them so it acts as SMP, but so far no good
2006-09-13T12:13:00.000Z	britt	total_meltdown	how are they connected? 10/100 is a HUGE bottleneck
2006-09-13T12:14:00.000Z	total_meltdown	britt	Yeah, 10/100. My laptop is their DHCP server - I was planning on it being the head node too, and if all went well, I might incorporate my big desktop into the mix too
2006-09-13T12:14:00.000Z	britt	total_meltdown	i'm really intrested to learn more. Care to share more info via email? I could pm you my addy
2006-09-13T12:14:00.000Z	total_meltdown	britt	sure
2006-09-13T12:23:00.000Z	total_meltdown	britt	I prefer Kubuntu just cause KDE is the greatest thing since the big bang
2006-09-13T12:32:00.000Z	britt	total_meltdown	you should have a server in your room
2006-09-13T12:32:00.000Z	total_meltdown	britt	I do.
2006-09-13T12:45:00.000Z	britt	total_meltdown	is it rw yet?
2006-09-13T12:46:00.000Z	total_meltdown	britt	I think it might be, but it's like running Windows ME. You -can- but when something breaks and you lose everything you care about, nobody will feel sorry for you
