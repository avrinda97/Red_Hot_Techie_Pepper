2010-04-21T04:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	yaaar	Ubuntu is pretty well tuned for ssd's by default, lucid will be moreso (at least with respect to boot times)
2010-04-21T04:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	yaaar	What problem are you having?
2010-04-21T04:45:00.000Z	yaaar	Jordan_U	i just installed 9.10 on this hp pavilion dv6000 and it won't boot. i get to grub and every option (once i take out the quiet bits) gives me "error: Couldn't open file"
2010-04-21T04:46:00.000Z	yaaar	Jordan_U	i googled some but didn't find anyone with the same issue...found some folks with other weird boot problems who suggested adding 'noapic nolapic' to the kernel line....but that didn't do anything. also booted the livecd, mounted/chrooted into the system and reinstalled grub with no luck
2010-04-21T04:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	yaaar	May be a BIOS bug if your BIOS can't read past a certain point in large drives. But then you usually get an "out of disk" error.
2010-04-21T04:48:00.000Z	yaaar	Jordan_U	so, figure i create a separate /boot partition at the front of the drive?
2010-04-21T04:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	yaaar	It's worth a try eventually but first you should try doing some testing in the grub shell, for instance use "ls /boot" to see if your kernels are listed.
2010-04-21T04:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	yaaar	Can you be on IRC and at the grub shell at the same time?
2010-04-21T04:59:00.000Z	yaaar	Jordan_U	sorry had to go afk for a minute. the troublesome computer is in the next room, so i've been employing a bit of sneakernet...anyway, i can do ls /boot no problem, shows the files.
2010-04-21T05:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	yaaar	Try typing in the linux and initrd commands from your grub.cfg directly into the grub shell (you can replace root=UUID= with root=/dev/sdXX to be easier to type)
2010-04-21T05:03:00.000Z	yaaar	Jordan_U	the linux command gives the same "error: Couldn't read file" (and of course the initrd command fails because there's no kernel loaded"
2010-04-21T05:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	yaaar	Could you run "md5sum /boot/linux..." for one of your kernels and confirm that it matches what's seen in the booted system?
2010-04-21T05:12:00.000Z	yaaar	Jordan_U	the grub shell doesn't know 'md5sum'
2010-04-21T05:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	yaaar	Seems that command was added in 1.98 :(
2010-04-21T05:14:00.000Z	yaaar	Jordan_U	anyway i doubt the kernel image is the problem. in particular, the memtest image does the same thing
2010-04-21T05:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	yaaar	It wasn't to test that the kernel image was correct, it was to test that grub is reading the file properly (i.e. if the md5sum matches what linux sees)
2010-04-21T05:16:00.000Z	yaaar	Jordan_U	oh, i follow
2010-04-21T05:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	yaaar	You probably won't be able to see the output well enough to do much good, but try running "set debug=disk" before the linux command or add it to your grub.cfg.
2010-04-21T05:27:00.000Z	yaaar	Jordan_U	yeah, i don't think that told us anything. all the lines except the last couple were "disk.c:389 Reading `hd0,1'..." and then "disk.c:457 hd0,1 read failed" followed by "closing..."
2010-04-21T05:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	yaaar	Is this an older machine?
2010-04-21T05:29:00.000Z	yaaar	Jordan_U	couple years. it came with vista on it if that tells you anything
