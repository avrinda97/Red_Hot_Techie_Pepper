2009-11-20T02:27:00.000Z	blacksun7		i'm attempting to recover a large number of file, most of them archives
2009-11-20T02:28:00.000Z	blacksun7		i've been attempting to find a bash script that would rename files after their archived contents, thus saving me the time of looking into every single archive manually
2009-11-20T02:28:00.000Z	blacksun7		anyone have any suggestion or idea of how to accomplish this?
2009-11-20T02:28:00.000Z	ScabbyMadman	blacksun7	have you recovered the files yet?
2009-11-20T02:29:00.000Z	blacksun7	ScabbyMadman	I've moved them from the affected drive, if that's what you're asking
2009-11-20T02:30:00.000Z	ScabbyMadman	blacksun7	and you want to say alter the name to something like *recovered?
2009-11-20T02:30:00.000Z	blacksun7	ScabbyMadman	no, mostly they are archives and currently have the ####### recovered filename syntax
2009-11-20T02:31:00.000Z	ScabbyMadman	blacksun7	some sort of conditional processing loop involving a 'for' statement comes to mind...
2009-11-20T02:32:00.000Z	blacksun7	ScabbyMadman	and erUSUL : good ideas, I'm just not too strong myself
2009-11-20T02:33:00.000Z	ScabbyMadman	blacksun7	the issue appears to be you want to shorten the name...
2009-11-20T02:33:00.000Z	ScabbyMadman	blacksun7	sorry Im confused
2009-11-20T02:35:00.000Z	blacksun7	ScabbyMadman	yes
2009-11-20T02:36:00.000Z	blacksun7	ScabbyMadman	i see the contents of the rar, all seem to be intact that i've opened
2009-11-20T02:37:00.000Z	ScabbyMadman	blacksun7	and theres nothing unique from one archive to another that stands o ut...thats thekey
2009-11-20T02:37:00.000Z	blacksun7	ScabbyMadman	well each archive has different contents
2009-11-20T02:39:00.000Z	ScabbyMadman	blacksun7	the only option that comes tomind is that you might try to insert a ($date) directive when renaming the archives
2009-11-20T02:39:00.000Z	ScabbyMadman	blacksun7	does that make sense?
2009-11-20T02:41:00.000Z	ScabbyMadman	blacksun7	that s looks like a good start
2009-11-20T02:42:00.000Z	ScabbyMadman	blacksun7	if   you insert a ($date) variable in the renaming with a time qualifier youre in business
2009-11-20T02:43:00.000Z	ScabbyMadman	blacksun7	that link is  just about pastebin quality ;)
2009-11-20T02:45:00.000Z	ScabbyMadman	blacksun7	that stuff in the link doesent exactly look like bash shell code...but if you can  glue it onto a linux box somehow..
