2005-11-03T07:47:00.000Z	balrog-kun		hi there
2005-11-03T07:48:00.000Z	balrog-kun		what happens to old configuration files in /etc when doin dist-upgrade in synaptic?
2005-11-03T07:48:00.000Z	balrog-kun		are they lost?
2005-11-03T07:48:00.000Z	bob2	balrog-kun	of course not
2005-11-03T07:49:00.000Z	bob2	balrog-kun	this is not some half-arsesd OS; unchanged files are upgraded automatically, modified ones will ask you to see what you want to do
2005-11-03T07:49:00.000Z	balrog-kun	bob2	it seems all the settings were reset, additionaly the old fonts are missing
2005-11-03T07:49:00.000Z	bob2	balrog-kun	"all the settings" = ?
2005-11-03T07:49:00.000Z	balrog-kun	bob2	well, locales, themes
2005-11-03T07:50:00.000Z	balrog-kun	bob2	it was in synapting, not using apt-get - would it still ask about configuration files?
2005-11-03T07:50:00.000Z	bob2	balrog-kun	what do you mean by locales? the default locale as set in /etc/environment was changed?
2005-11-03T07:50:00.000Z	bob2	balrog-kun	I'd assume so
2005-11-03T07:51:00.000Z	balrog-kun	bob2	yes, the default locale reverted to C and when i change it manualy in a terminal the programs say locale si not supported
2005-11-03T07:51:00.000Z	bob2	balrog-kun	that would be a bug
2005-11-03T07:51:00.000Z	balrog-kun	bob2	well, probably i messed something then :)
2005-11-03T10:12:00.000Z	bob2	balrog-kun	fix /etc/environment
2005-11-03T10:13:00.000Z	balrog-kun	bob2	the locale is set in /etc/environment, i checked it, but for example gnome-terminal shows something like C library doesn't support locale, falling back to C locale.
2005-11-03T10:13:00.000Z	bob2	balrog-kun	what does "locale" print? (#flood, not here)
2005-11-03T10:14:00.000Z	balrog-kun	bob2	it prints what it always printed, the problems is with the binary of libc it seems
2005-11-03T10:14:00.000Z	balrog-kun	bob2	"locale" just prints everything set to "pl_PL" as it should be, i cannot copy&paste at the moment
2005-11-03T10:14:00.000Z	bob2	balrog-kun	try 'sudo locale-gen'
2005-11-03T10:15:00.000Z	balrog-kun	bob2	ok
