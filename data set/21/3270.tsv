2009-03-28T17:26:00.000Z	remu		hey guys, im trying to remove tspc from my computer, and im running into a problem....it wont uninstall, heres the output: http://paste.ubuntu.com/139509/
2009-03-28T17:28:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	remu	did you try to stop the service manually?
2009-03-28T17:29:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	remu	and did you succeed?
2009-03-28T17:29:00.000Z	remu	dhruvasagar	that was the output when i stopped it manually, and then tried to uninstall it
2009-03-28T17:30:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	remu	the output there is of the purge command, and it says that it failed to stop the server...
2009-03-28T17:30:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	remu	did you try using synaptic instead?
2009-03-28T17:30:00.000Z	remu	dhruvasagar	no, it is a headless server that i am ssh-ing into
2009-03-28T17:31:00.000Z	remu	dhruvasagar	this is the output when i try to stop it manually first, then purge it http://paste.ubuntu.com/139513/
2009-03-28T17:31:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	remu	hmmm, I am sorry I do not know about that
2009-03-28T17:32:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	remu	I think the stop command hadn't completed before you started to purge the package, and the stop command failed midway while doing so for whatever reasons
2009-03-28T17:33:00.000Z	remu	dhruvasagar	I see.....so should I try to stop it again, and wait for a while before I do the purge command?
2009-03-28T17:33:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	remu	I would suggest that
2009-03-28T17:34:00.000Z	remu	dhruvasagar	this is what I have:umer@server:~$ sudo /etc/init.d/tspc stop
2009-03-28T17:34:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	remu	wait a lil more till you get success or failure...
2009-03-28T17:35:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	remu	any luck?
2009-03-28T17:36:00.000Z	remu	dhruvasagar	still waiting, no change
2009-03-28T17:36:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	remu	hmmmm
2009-03-28T17:38:00.000Z	remu	dhruvasagar	I know, its confusing
2009-03-28T17:39:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	remu	yes...maybe you will have to go offline or something to forcefully stop it or something...or maybe someone with more insight should speak up, why don't you ask the problem again
2009-03-28T17:40:00.000Z	remu	dhruvasagar	what do you mean go offline?
2009-03-28T17:41:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	remu	I meant that you perhaps disconnect
