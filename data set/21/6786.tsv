2007-06-05T13:48:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x		No prob shiftplusone =)
2007-06-05T13:48:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x		If it doesn't work let me know and we'll hack it into working.
2007-06-05T13:49:00.000Z	mc44	r00tintheb0x	thats a pretty bad suggestion
2007-06-05T13:52:00.000Z	mc44	r00tintheb0x	please don't recommend using the driver from nvidias website
2007-06-05T13:53:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	mc44	I wont reccomend doing that again, but may i ask why its frowned upon?
2007-06-05T13:53:00.000Z	mc44	r00tintheb0x	well, because its easier and better to use the drivers in the repos
2007-06-05T13:54:00.000Z	mc44	r00tintheb0x	:) in feisty is should just be a couple of clicks to get them working
2007-06-05T13:55:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	mc44	i know... im just all about using the latest and greatest... i KNOW the one on NVIDIAs site is the latest, although the one in the repos may be also.
2007-06-05T13:55:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	mc44	sorry... i dont  think of the beginners sometimes :)
2007-06-05T13:55:00.000Z	mc44	r00tintheb0x	its not even to do with being a beginner, the ones in the repos are updated with kernel updates
2007-06-08T16:34:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	mc44	when you "apt-get install nvidia-glx-new" shouldn't it provice nvidia.ko ?
2007-06-08T16:37:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	mc44	no he changed the module name manually.
2007-06-08T16:43:00.000Z	mc44	r00tintheb0x	you can just do "lsmod | grep nvidia" to see if the module is loaded
2007-06-08T16:55:00.000Z	mc44	r00tintheb0x	-new should be the right driver
2007-06-08T05:18:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	mc44	you from the states?
2007-06-08T05:19:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	mc44	you any good at corp linux?
