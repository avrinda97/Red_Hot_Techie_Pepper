2007-12-09T09:33:00.000Z	evfan42		when I have all the effects on with my nvidia geforce ti 4200, I cant see the top menu bar with the minimize and exit buttons on it, and my terminal is completely white
2007-12-09T09:33:00.000Z	Invisible_Ubuntu	evfan42	is your monitor refresh/resolution right?
2007-12-09T09:34:00.000Z	Invisible_Ubuntu	evfan42	did you put that in your xorg conf after looking at your manual to what specifics it is?
2007-12-09T09:35:00.000Z	evfan42	Invisible_Ubuntu	yeah it worked fine until I rebotoed my computer, I dont quite follow you on your last comment
2007-12-09T09:36:00.000Z	Invisible_Ubuntu	evfan42	Ok as I remember it been a while, to properly setup your xorg and make drivers optimal you need to put in the Refresh mhz rate in the xorg.conf file to match your monitor otherwise its some generic one
2007-12-09T09:36:00.000Z	Invisible_Ubuntu	evfan42	some sizes aren't support and with mhz refresh off it won't line up edge to edge right is what I'm saying
2007-12-09T09:42:00.000Z	Invisible_Ubuntu	evfan42	that is listed in your users manual or found on our monitor website after some digging
2007-12-09T09:58:00.000Z	Invisible_Ubuntu	evfan42	sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-12-09T09:58:00.000Z	Invisible_Ubuntu	evfan42	that will get you in your xorg config file.. go to the bottom where it talks about what Resolutions/refresh for your monitor and out it in there..
2007-12-09T09:59:00.000Z	Invisible_Ubuntu	evfan42	looking for this Section "Monitor"
2007-12-09T10:01:00.000Z	Invisible_Ubuntu	evfan42	I'll be doing something along that line in a day or two when I'm done ripping my music I'm going to get my video properly working and setup my dual monitors
2007-12-09T10:06:00.000Z	Invisible_Ubuntu	evfan42	it work ok and you get into gui?
2007-12-09T10:07:00.000Z	Invisible_Ubuntu	evfan42	go to the Display manager and resize your desktop then do the "Auto Adjust" on your monitor
2007-12-09T10:09:00.000Z	Invisible_Ubuntu	evfan42	System > Administration > Screen and Graphics
2007-12-09T10:09:00.000Z	Invisible_Ubuntu	evfan42	what resolution/depth you have it on?
2007-12-09T10:10:00.000Z	Invisible_Ubuntu	evfan42	Refresh rate?
2007-12-09T10:12:00.000Z	Invisible_Ubuntu	evfan42	change it in there to 60, and then "Auto Adjust" on your monitor
2007-12-09T10:12:00.000Z	evfan42	Invisible_Ubuntu	it won't let me change it to 60, and it doesn't say auto anything anywhere
2007-12-09T10:14:00.000Z	Invisible_Ubuntu	evfan42	right about it under Monitor, try to find yours in the list maybe that will help if not then I'm not sure :S your xorg.conf is properly setup..
2007-12-09T10:14:00.000Z	Invisible_Ubuntu	evfan42	as I said its been a while and sorry I couldn't help more
2007-12-09T10:15:00.000Z	Invisible_Ubuntu	evfan42	np hope someone else can help you with that
