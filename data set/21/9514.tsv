2005-09-20T06:48:00.000Z	Answer		Hello W0rld
2005-09-20T06:49:00.000Z	Answer		Question: When I unplug my laptop, the battery meter says "System is running on ac power, no battery present"  but it is clearly running on the battery and not ac power ?
2005-09-20T06:50:00.000Z	TMM	Answer	compaq laptop is it? :)
2005-09-20T06:50:00.000Z	Answer	TMM	IT is a Dell Inspiron 4150 laptop
2005-09-20T06:52:00.000Z	TMM	Answer	type "sudo rmmod battery && sudo modprobe battery" in a terminal window
2005-09-20T06:52:00.000Z	TMM	Answer	then wait a bit untill the battery monitor adjusts itself :)
2005-09-20T06:53:00.000Z	Answer	TMM	I typed those commands and there was no output and the battery meter didnt change at all ?
2005-09-20T06:53:00.000Z	TMM	Answer	you are not supposed to get output, just wait a little bit
2005-09-20T06:54:00.000Z	TMM	Answer	and past the LAST LINE ONLY of the output of dmesg|tail here
2005-09-20T06:54:00.000Z	Answer	TMM	But then I wont get warned about #flood and pastebin hhehehe
2005-09-20T06:54:00.000Z	TMM	Answer	not if you only put in one line
2005-09-20T06:55:00.000Z	TMM	Answer	LAST LINE ONLY :) get it? ;)
2005-09-20T06:55:00.000Z	Answer	TMM	the second to last line says ACPI: [BAT0]  present,  the last line sayd [BAT1]  absent
2005-09-20T06:56:00.000Z	TMM	Answer	I get that too sometimes, nothing much that you can do but chech the linux acpi projects (acpi.sf.net) webpage and hope that there's a fixed DSDT for you laptop... or read the docs on fixing it yourself
2005-09-20T06:57:00.000Z	TMM	Answer	rebooting without the ac adapter plugged in seems to cure it for my laptop though
2005-09-20T06:57:00.000Z	TMM	Answer	even if I plug it back in later... but it's somewhat sub-optimal
2005-09-20T06:57:00.000Z	Answer	TMM	It does not hinder the functionality other than I don't know when the battery will run out.  It's good in some ways since the screen doesnt darken
2005-09-20T06:58:00.000Z	TMM	Answer	well, that's the answer then :) if you care about it, check acpi.sf.net, if you don't you can either boot without ac plugged in (might work) or just ignore it completly then :)
2005-09-20T06:58:00.000Z	TMM	Answer	I choose for the last option, I know how much time I have on a battery :)
2005-09-20T06:59:00.000Z	Answer	TMM	Is there any command line battery level tool ?
2005-09-20T07:00:00.000Z	TMM	Answer	that won't work either, the problem is with the DSDT of your bios, not with gnome, all tools will give the same result
