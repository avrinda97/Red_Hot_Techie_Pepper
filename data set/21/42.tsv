2012-11-19T08:47:00.000Z	ColdRush		I'm looking for pygtk 2.14, what do that translate to...
2012-11-19T08:48:00.000Z	ColdRush		obkey
2012-11-19T08:48:00.000Z	ColdRush		Alright
2012-11-19T08:48:00.000Z	ColdRush		Yeah I figured :P
2012-11-19T08:49:00.000Z	ColdRush		Never thought getting my brightness keys to work would be this big of a pita
2012-11-19T08:50:00.000Z	ColdRush		I finally got keytouch working and theres a bug that prevents my brightness up from working
2012-11-19T08:50:00.000Z	ColdRush		I use crunchbang on my server but I followed guides for that, I'm trying to use this lubuntu netbook as my daily machine though
2012-11-19T08:50:00.000Z	ColdRush		It's been rough :(
2012-11-19T08:51:00.000Z	ColdRush		I'm afraid to run gnome, this is a single core atom
2012-11-19T08:52:00.000Z	ColdRush		Never tried it
2012-11-19T08:52:00.000Z	DaemonicApathy	ColdRush	I broke my brightness hotkeys by accident a few days ago. Here's a simple fix: http://askubuntu.com/questions/174770/is-there-a-way-to-set-a-hotkey-to-change-screen-brightness
2012-11-19T08:53:00.000Z	ColdRush	DaemonicApathy	would I be able to do that on a CR48?  I don't have fn or f# keys
2012-11-19T08:57:00.000Z	ColdRush	DaemonicApathy	does it matter that I am using lxde?
2012-11-19T08:57:00.000Z	DaemonicApathy	ColdRush	Not that I know of. If you can find a solution simpler for you, though, awesome.
2012-11-19T08:58:00.000Z	ColdRush	DaemonicApathy	Well considering I can't even get these python thingys to run, I'm gonna try that
2012-11-19T08:58:00.000Z	ColdRush	DaemonicApathy	How do I find my keycodes?
2012-11-19T08:59:00.000Z	DaemonicApathy	ColdRush	minor mistake on my part. If you use the Ubuntu settings to make the command, you can just hit the key combo you want for it. Mistook the command for the trigger for a minute.
2012-11-19T08:59:00.000Z	ColdRush	DaemonicApathy	I'm using lubuntu so I'm assuming I'll have issues
2012-11-19T09:01:00.000Z	ColdRush	DaemonicApathy	Not that I know of
2012-11-19T09:03:00.000Z	DaemonicApathy	ColdRush	That's bothersome. Looks like you'd have to edit /home/<user>/.config/openbox/lxde-rc.xml manually. #lubuntu may be of more help to you. :-/
2012-11-19T09:04:00.000Z	ColdRush	DaemonicApathy	I was in there earlier and nobody ever talks...guess I didn't pick a great distro to work with haha
