2008-03-21T19:02:00.000Z	ZeroDamage		Anyone recommend a IRC Bouncer that works and installs well with 6.06?
2008-03-21T19:03:00.000Z	Exteris	ZeroDamage	muh
2008-03-21T19:04:00.000Z	ZeroDamage	Exteris	muh's deb package doesn't create the muhrc config file which is making the setup a bit painful.  Know where it goes?
2008-03-21T19:05:00.000Z	Exteris	ZeroDamage	/etc/muhrc? in a tar.gz in /usr/share ?
2008-03-21T19:05:00.000Z	Exteris	ZeroDamage	or you get one from the site itself
2008-03-21T19:06:00.000Z	Exteris	ZeroDamage	why do you want to use muh and not direct connect?
2008-03-21T19:06:00.000Z	ZeroDamage	Exteris	I want to maitain idle in a couple of particular channels without leaving my main system on.  I plan to run this on my home server.
2008-03-21T19:07:00.000Z	Exteris	ZeroDamage	ofcourse :P
2008-03-21T19:08:00.000Z	ZeroDamage		exteris:  are there any others besides muh that will install without the headache that muh has given me?  I would settle for a generic config file for muh if I could download one
2008-03-21T19:08:00.000Z	Exteris	ZeroDamage	you could try psybnc
2008-03-21T19:09:00.000Z	Exteris	ZeroDamage	$HOME/.muh/muhrc. ?
2008-03-21T19:10:00.000Z	ZeroDamage		exteris:  It isn't maintained any more from I can tell (psybnc) and it would not install on my 6.06 server machine.  As for the muhrc file, it did not create that folder or put that file in there. Looking at the debian package contents, that file is not there.
2008-03-21T19:10:00.000Z	Exteris	ZeroDamage	do a locate muhrc ?
2008-03-21T19:10:00.000Z	ZeroDamage		exteris:  yep, nowhere on the system.  Have you tried miau?
2008-03-21T19:11:00.000Z	Exteris	ZeroDamage	no i havent
2008-03-21T19:12:00.000Z	Exteris	ZeroDamage	http://www.filewatcher.com/p/muh-2.1-0.rc1.3mdk.src.rpm.116312/muhrc.bz2.html
2008-03-21T19:12:00.000Z	ZeroDamage		exteris:  thanks.  Now I gotta figure out how to work with the bz2 file.  :)
2008-03-21T19:13:00.000Z	Exteris	ZeroDamage	extract it, and put it in /home/user/.muh/muhrc
2008-03-21T19:14:00.000Z	Exteris		lol, ZeroDamage, theres a sample in /usr/share/doc/muh/examples/muhrc.gz
2008-03-21T19:16:00.000Z	ZeroDamage	Exteris	 It did not install that there for me.  Which is why I am here.  :)   Thanks for the help.
2008-03-21T19:17:00.000Z	Exteris	ZeroDamage	did the bz2 archive work alright?
