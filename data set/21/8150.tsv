2006-05-27T06:09:00.000Z	philipp__		Hi, I'm searching for a Howto to enable Routing between two _private_ subnets. I don't want to masquerade
2006-05-27T06:10:00.000Z	philipp__		hi naxo
2006-05-27T06:11:00.000Z	philipp__		Does anyone knows how to enable routing between to subnets without masquerading?
2006-05-27T06:11:00.000Z	philipp__		two ;-)
2006-05-27T06:11:00.000Z	arcade	philipp__	What are the subnets?
2006-05-27T06:11:00.000Z	arcade	philipp__	If they use different IP's, there's no problem in enabling routing.
2006-05-27T06:12:00.000Z	arcade	philipp__	do one box have both networks connected, or are there routers in between?
2006-05-27T06:12:00.000Z	philipp__	arcade	One box have both networks connected (wlan and eth)
2006-05-27T06:12:00.000Z	arcade	philipp__	just enable ip_forwarding
2006-05-27T06:13:00.000Z	philipp__	arcade	echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward doesn't work
2006-05-27T06:19:00.000Z	arcade	philipp__	Thing is.  Say you have eth0:192.168.0.1, and eth1:10.0.0.1
2006-05-27T06:20:00.000Z	philipp__	arcade	that's what I want
2006-05-27T06:20:00.000Z	philipp__	arcade	rochfordo: I just want to have a connection between this subnets, no internet, nothing else ;-)
2006-05-27T06:21:00.000Z	philipp__	arcade	uh, that may be the problem: the way back
2006-05-27T06:22:00.000Z	arcade	philipp__	Good.
2006-05-27T06:22:00.000Z	arcade	philipp__	no problem.
