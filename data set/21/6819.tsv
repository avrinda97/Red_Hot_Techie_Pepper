2010-02-17T17:51:00.000Z	sipior	xover	you shouldn't. maybe you're doing it wrong?

2010-02-17T17:52:00.000Z	xover		i have hard coded in the password, its the only way to stop it complaining, even that has stopped working now.
2010-02-17T17:54:00.000Z	xover	sipior	so whats the right way?
2010-02-17T17:54:00.000Z	sipior	xover	to do what, add a printer?

2010-02-17T17:55:00.000Z	xover		i have seen bug reports about this, so i know its not me
2010-02-17T17:55:00.000Z	sipior	xover	given that i don't know what you did exactly, your question is difficult to answer.
2010-02-17T17:56:00.000Z	xover		I added a printer, it worked for months, no its says "too many authentication tries"
2010-02-17T17:56:00.000Z	sipior	xover	what did you do right before it stopped working?
2010-02-17T17:57:00.000Z	xover		now it says 'cant prompt for authorization"
2010-02-17T17:57:00.000Z	xover		nothinh.
