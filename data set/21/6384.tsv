2007-04-23T05:05:00.000Z	jandro		hi everyone! I have been looking through the beryl website, but i'm a little lost, what's the difference between beryl on xgl, aiglx, nvidia? i own a nvidia gforce, where can i read about it?
2007-04-23T05:07:00.000Z	SubMOA	jandro	not sure on all those, but I believe XGL and AIGXL are X-servers while NVidia is a graphics card (like ATi (a competitor))
2007-04-23T05:08:00.000Z	jandro	SubMOA	the issue is that i dont know which installation guide i should follow, the nvidia one?
2007-04-23T05:09:00.000Z	SubMOA	jandro	do you have an invidia card?  As in... um... not sure how to explain that.  Are you on a laptop or a vanilla (generic) PC?
2007-04-23T05:09:00.000Z	jandro	SubMOA	yes, i have a nvidia card, i think is gforce 6400 go, it's a vaio laptop
2007-04-23T05:10:00.000Z	SubMOA	jandro	 ok, well... follow the nvidia instructions (that goodness, too... ATi is a pain in the you-know-what)
2007-04-23T05:11:00.000Z	SubMOA	jandro	 as far as xgl vs aigxl, not sure... I don't remember what I did... let me google a bit
2007-04-23T05:11:00.000Z	jandro	SubMOA	thanks
2007-04-23T05:12:00.000Z	jandro	SubMOA	ok
2007-04-23T05:12:00.000Z	SubMOA	jandro	beryl (a fork of compiz) was the first thing I ever did on linux... took me a month :O)
2007-04-23T05:12:00.000Z	jandro	SubMOA	oops, hope to be luckier than you ;)
2007-04-23T05:12:00.000Z	SubMOA	jandro	HA, yea, me too!
2007-04-23T05:19:00.000Z	jandro	SubMOA	so, referring to this wiki http://wiki.beryl-project.org/wiki/Install_Beryl_on_Ubuntu , which guide should i follow the best, it is for feisty
2007-04-23T05:21:00.000Z	SubMOA	jandro	hmm... ok, one sec... i installed on edgy... I think feisty might already have some stuff installed... you might only need to go to the repository (repo for short) and search for "beryl" (or "compiz" i suppose, but I prefer beryl)
2007-04-23T05:25:00.000Z	jandro	SubMOA	thanks, another thing i think i need for this cube applications is the acceleration on the card, yesterday having a look around i come across that there's many ways to install the nvidia driver. Due to there's not yet an official feisty installing guide, i'm lost about how to isnstall it, do you have any idea?
2007-04-23T05:28:00.000Z	SubMOA	jandro	this would seem to answer all of your questions: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-install-beryl-with-latest-nvidia-drivers-in-ubuntu-feisty-fawn.html
2007-04-23T05:30:00.000Z	jandro	SubMOA	thank you very much, now i have to leave, i'll try later! can't wait to see the cube in my screen, bye!
2007-04-23T05:30:00.000Z	SubMOA	jandro	no prob, night, good luck
2007-04-23T05:32:00.000Z	jandro	SubMOA	one more thing, what words did you used on google to find that link? i'm a little rusty in using google
2007-04-23T05:32:00.000Z	SubMOA	jandro	one sec...
2007-04-23T05:32:00.000Z	SubMOA	jandro	"feisty fawn nvidia driver install" the second link down
