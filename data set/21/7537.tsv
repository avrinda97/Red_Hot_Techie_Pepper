2007-02-22T15:00:00.000Z	Assid		err. when the new "updates" are processed.. does it automatically clear archives?
2007-02-22T15:01:00.000Z	Flannel	Assid	no, you can do it manually easily though
2007-02-22T15:01:00.000Z	Flannel	Assid	"sudo apt-get clean" or "sudo apt-get autoclean", depending on what you want to do
2007-02-22T15:01:00.000Z	Flannel	Assid	correct.
2007-02-22T15:04:00.000Z	Flannel	Assid	alright, well, now you know how anyway ;)
2007-02-22T15:21:00.000Z	Assid	Flannel	would you happen to know how to increase the number of simultanous connections apt can do ?
2008-04-29T23:43:00.000Z	Assid	Flannel	dvd install lets you do raid and stuff?
2008-04-29T23:44:00.000Z	Assid	Flannel	?
2008-04-29T23:44:00.000Z	Flannel	Assid	DVD has debian installer and ubiquity available, so yes.
2008-04-29T23:45:00.000Z	Flannel	Assid	but, 4G vs 700M is quite a bit of overhead if all you're trying to do is install.  Grab the alternate CD instead
2008-04-29T23:46:00.000Z	Assid	Flannel	gotta distrib them .. so its alrite.. people dont like text installers anymore
2008-04-29T23:46:00.000Z	Assid	Flannel	and i need them to try it
2008-04-29T23:46:00.000Z	Flannel	Assid	You can't do RAID in ubiquity, even on the DVD.  You'll need to go text for that, whehter on the DVD or the alternate CD
2008-04-29T23:49:00.000Z	Flannel	Assid	At least, I believe Ubiquity can't still do RAID and other things like that (LVM for instance).  I may be wrong as of Hardy, as I haven't completely updated my mind yet.
2008-05-24T22:45:00.000Z	Flannel	Assid	`deb [repository] ubuntu main restricted universe multiverse` then replace ubuntu with ubuntu-updates and ubuntu-security.  That's all there is to it.  Also, remove restricted/multiverse/universe if you don't want to use those
2008-05-24T22:45:00.000Z	Flannel	Assid	Oh.  What version of Ubuntu is it?
2008-05-24T22:47:00.000Z	Flannel	Assid	You'll have to go feisty -> gutsy -> hardy
2008-05-24T22:52:00.000Z	Flannel	Assid	You don't need to change sources.list to upgrade: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GutsyUpgrades#head-f2435a45758bb5836f8e5b87e90045463f8c6ec7
2008-11-02T11:56:00.000Z	Flannel	Assid	Install bootchart and find out whats holding you up.
2008-11-02T11:57:00.000Z	Assid	Flannel	still on live cd
2010-05-30T08:56:00.000Z	Flannel	Assid	"the site"?
