2010-01-01T22:33:00.000Z	DVA5912		in ubuntu server, how do i obtain permison to modify files inside of /var/www?
2010-01-01T22:34:00.000Z	DVA5912		i did sudo adduser clint www-data... that should add me to the www-data group right?
2010-01-01T22:35:00.000Z	usr13	DVA5912	sudo
2010-01-01T22:36:00.000Z	DVA5912		i noticed taht the files inside of www-data were set as root only... deleted them let me try again. usr13
2010-01-01T22:36:00.000Z	usr13	DVA5912	What are you trying to do?
2010-01-01T22:36:00.000Z	DVA5912	usr13	obtain access to the www-data directory from my account
2010-01-01T22:36:00.000Z	DVA5912		i kep getting permision denitd
2010-01-01T22:37:00.000Z	usr13	DVA5912	Why not just use sudo?
2010-01-01T22:37:00.000Z	DVA5912	usr13	because i dont want too!!! and i cant do that over ftp/ssh via my client
2010-01-01T22:37:00.000Z	usr13	DVA5912	But what are you serving there?  What is the end result of this project?
2010-01-01T22:37:00.000Z	DVA5912	usr13	what does it matter
2010-01-01T22:38:00.000Z	DVA5912	usr13	im not worried about security concerns.
2010-01-01T22:38:00.000Z	usr13	DVA5912	so you are ftping into the server?  It is not your server?
2010-01-01T22:38:00.000Z	DVA5912		i am ftp yes, and yes its my server
2010-01-01T22:39:00.000Z	usr13	DVA5912	I'm not understaning the situation completely, BUT, my advise is to create a user and symlink to the /var/www/htdocs/ or wherever and then when you ftp or ssh in as that user, you have full premissions to all that is there.  Much easier.
2010-01-01T22:40:00.000Z	usr13	DVA5912	In other words move the directory to a user directory and symlink it to /var/www/ or /var/www/htdocs or where ever you are serving from.
2010-01-01T22:41:00.000Z	usr13	DVA5912	If you are not worried about server concerns you can just change permissions to all of it.
2010-01-01T22:41:00.000Z	DVA5912	usr13	im gonig to do it another way. forget the ftp, il just ssh to the box. bypass it all
2010-01-01T22:42:00.000Z	usr13	DVA5912	sure ssh into it and do as you like. But as I said before, it might be easier in the long run to move the files to a user dir.
2010-01-01T22:43:00.000Z	usr13	DVA5912	But you can also change permissions via ftp ...
2010-01-01T22:44:00.000Z	DVA5912	usr13	i know...
