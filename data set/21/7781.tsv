2006-07-20T16:49:00.000Z	paulm		Does anyone know a program that will play  .wmv files?
2006-07-20T16:49:00.000Z	thefish	paulm	mplayer
2006-07-20T16:51:00.000Z	thefish	paulm	try "dpkg -l | grep -i codec" and look for something like w32codecs-all
2006-07-20T16:52:00.000Z	paulm	thefish	 im using synaptic at the mo...
2006-07-20T16:52:00.000Z	thefish	paulm	ok, just look to see if you have that installed
2006-07-20T16:52:00.000Z	paulm	thefish	and according to synaptic i have that installed already
2006-07-20T16:53:00.000Z	paulm	thefish	 do i need to activate it in mplayer some how?
2006-07-20T16:53:00.000Z	thefish	paulm	no
2006-07-20T16:54:00.000Z	thefish	paulm	it should "just work" (TM)
2006-07-20T16:54:00.000Z	paulm	thefish	  lol  :-)   well...its not
2006-07-20T16:54:00.000Z	thefish	paulm	it could be that the wmv is encoded with some wierd proprietary kaka
2006-07-20T16:55:00.000Z	thefish	paulm	have you tried other wmv files?
2006-07-20T16:55:00.000Z	paulm	thefish	 I have realplayer if that would do it? Yeah it probably is encoded
2006-07-20T16:55:00.000Z	paulm	thefish	from the same site yes, and none work
2006-07-20T16:55:00.000Z	thefish	paulm	not sure if realplayer can do wmv
2006-07-20T16:55:00.000Z	thefish	paulm	try another site
2006-07-20T16:58:00.000Z	paulm	thefish	ok, i can get the plugin for FireFox to work  http://www.linspire.com/file_types/wmv_sample.php  but files i downloaded dont work.
2006-07-20T16:58:00.000Z	paulm	thefish	as you said they could be encoded specially or some crap like that
2006-07-20T16:59:00.000Z	thefish	paulm	but that would mean you could not play it in anything
2006-07-20T05:01:00.000Z	paulm	thefish	the downloaded files CANNOT be played in anything, VLC Xine nothing. the streamed one  can be, with the mplayer plugin for firefox
