2012-02-26T22:51:00.000Z	LL2|Android		Hmmm
2012-02-26T22:51:00.000Z	LL2|Android		I want to make my ssh server login as my tf2server user, using sudo
2012-02-26T22:52:00.000Z	LL2|Android		I think I may have an idea for how to have it automatically run ~/startserv on server boot only
2012-02-26T22:52:00.000Z	LL2|Android		But I would like it if a bash expert could check if it will work
2012-02-26T22:53:00.000Z	LL2|Android		First though
2012-02-26T22:53:00.000Z	LL2|Android		I need to ask, will bash.rc run every time a user logs in with the login command?
2012-02-26T22:55:00.000Z	ssta	LL2|Android	.bash_profile will, which depending how it's setup will also call .bashrc.  Interactive shells (non-login shells) call ~/.bashrc only
2012-02-26T22:56:00.000Z	ssta	LL2|Android	root usually doesn't login on an ubuntu system
2012-02-26T22:57:00.000Z	LL2|Android	ssta	well, I'm trying to set up my ssh server to login to tf2server using sudo, and autorun ./startserv (or ~/startserv ) on boot ONLY
2012-02-26T22:57:00.000Z	ssta	LL2|Android	if you want to be sure it's set, add it to ~/.bashrc and ~/.bash_profile
2012-02-26T23:00:00.000Z	ssta	LL2|Android	if it were me, I'd put it all in a script and run it from /etc/rc.d.  There are manhy ways to do it though
2012-02-26T23:01:00.000Z	LL2|Android	ssta	mind pasting me the code to add into files?
2012-02-26T23:01:00.000Z	ssta	LL2|Android	since I don't really understand fully what you need, no, I can't really
2012-02-26T23:03:00.000Z	LL2|Android	ssta	is there any file I can use to run commands on BOOT ONLY?
2012-02-26T23:04:00.000Z	ssta	LL2|Android	/etc/rc.local
2012-02-26T23:04:00.000Z	ssta	LL2|Android	you can also use the @reboot directive in cron if you prefer
2012-02-26T23:08:00.000Z	ssta	LL2|Android	yes
2012-02-26T23:10:00.000Z	ssta	LL2|Android	should be able to, if you get the script right, yes
2012-02-26T23:10:00.000Z	ssta	LL2|Android	no, it ought to only execute when you reboot
2012-02-26T23:11:00.000Z	ssta	LL2|Android	although as llutz has just pointed out, not all cron implementations are safe that way (vixie cron is, which is what's in Ubuntu) -- some do it on crond restarts too
2012-02-26T23:12:00.000Z	ssta	LL2|Android	correct
