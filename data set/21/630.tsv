2011-08-20T20:39:00.000Z	markke		Anybody having troubles with PAE kernel 2.6.38.-11 on Natty? I get a black screen. Even on single user it won't boot.
2011-08-20T20:39:00.000Z	Kyle__	markke	And what happens with a normal kernel?
2011-08-20T20:40:00.000Z	markke	Kyle__	I'm on 2.6.38 default. I have 8GB ram. I thought I might try the latest available in USC and it's .11.
2011-08-20T20:41:00.000Z	Kyle__	markke	I would try moving to the 2.6.38 pae first, before trying moving to the latest avaiable.  One variable at a time, ya know?
2011-08-20T20:41:00.000Z	markke	Kyle__	normal kernel boots fine. I just need a PAE coz my 5 something GB of RAM Is useless.
2011-08-20T20:41:00.000Z	markke	Kyle__	makes sense.it's still DLing now. I'm asking if anybody got same probs :)
2011-08-20T20:42:00.000Z	Kyle__	markke	4gb.  Windows only uses 3 or 3.5 with 32bit, Linux uses 4 :)
2011-08-20T20:42:00.000Z	Kyle__	markke	KNow the feeling.  Good luck.
2011-08-20T20:43:00.000Z	markke	Kyle__	for some reason I only get 3.1 even on Linux. my desktop has 4GB and it's the same thing.
2011-08-20T20:44:00.000Z	Kyle__	markke	Odd.  Maybe your bios/chipset is using some.  Starting back in the early athalon days I think bioses & chipsets started gobbling up ram for their own uses.
2011-08-20T20:46:00.000Z	markke	Kyle__	yeah it's just 3186MB or roughly 3.2. It's being rounded to 3.1 on System Monitor, but `free` tells the true story.
2011-08-20T20:47:00.000Z	markke	Kyle__	do you know if anything higher than 2.6.38-8 fixes that regression Phoronix was talking about regarding kernel consuming more power? coz on desktop it's fine. but this here on my laptop i need to save as much power.
2011-08-20T20:48:00.000Z	Kyle__	markke	I hadn't read that one.
2011-08-20T20:48:00.000Z	Kyle__	markke	Gonna go search it out, sounds interesting.
2011-08-20T20:49:00.000Z	markke	Kyle__	you do that. the current Natty kernel accdg. to Phoronix gobbles up more power than the default Meerkat kernel.
2011-08-20T20:49:00.000Z	markke	Kyle__	IIRC by about 30%
2011-08-20T20:50:00.000Z	Kyle__	markke	Wow.  And I thought my netbook's battery was just going a little south bout when 11 came out.
2011-08-20T20:50:00.000Z	Kyle__	markke	...of course that was the excuse to buy a shiny new laptop.
2011-08-20T20:51:00.000Z	markke	Kyle__	IDK what the official kernel devs said about the claims by Phoronix but they had a really good story. Even 3.0 still hast that power hungry bug.
2011-08-20T20:51:00.000Z	markke	Kyle__	lol.... great excuse :P
2011-08-20T20:52:00.000Z	Kyle__	markke	My head's been deep in other efforts latey, but this does remind me to start reading phronix and other linux sites more regularly...
