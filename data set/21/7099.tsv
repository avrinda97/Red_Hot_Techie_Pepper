2009-10-09T20:35:00.000Z	DaveMustaine		Did
2009-10-09T20:35:00.000Z	genii	DaveMustaine	Consider using pastebin next time please
2009-10-09T23:13:00.000Z	genii	DaveMustaine	Does your motherboard have a Marvell SATA controller that also operates the onboard IDE? (Asus P5K series for example). Booting from CD on these is problemmatic
2009-10-09T23:16:00.000Z	genii	DaveMustaine	If you have an external CD drive I'd suggest trying to boot the CD from that
2009-10-09T23:22:00.000Z	genii	DaveMustaine	Ah. The reason being that the driver for usb CD drive works to install this way when the onboard/internal chipset doesn't work right.
2009-10-09T23:23:00.000Z	genii	DaveMustaine	You have 1 box already running Ubuntu, yes?
2009-10-09T23:25:00.000Z	genii	DaveMustaine	Hm. Because if an ubuntu box already was there, could do the PXE booting way
2009-10-09T23:25:00.000Z	genii	DaveMustaine	PXE booting is when the PC boots from the network
2009-10-09T23:26:00.000Z	genii	DaveMustaine	It has no ethernet adapter?
2009-10-09T23:28:00.000Z	genii	DaveMustaine	So it begins to boot, then goes black-screen? Or what exactly (behaves as no CD is there at all and goes to HD, does boot but at point XYZ fails, etc)
2009-10-09T23:30:00.000Z	genii	DaveMustaine	Sounds like CD is borked
2009-10-09T23:31:00.000Z	genii	DaveMustaine	Since you can view CD contents, drive is likely OK. So this leaves the CD itself
