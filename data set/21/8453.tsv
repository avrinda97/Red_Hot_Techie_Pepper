2006-04-15T09:38:00.000Z	tanuki		can someone tell me how to install the 'make' command on my computer?
2006-04-15T09:38:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	tanuki	install the 'build-essential' package
2006-04-16T08:32:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	tanuki	yes, very much better :)
2006-04-16T08:37:00.000Z	tanuki	PuMpErNiCkLe	why is it better?
2006-04-16T08:38:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	tanuki	tons of reasons - udev, Xgl/compiz, beagle, Gnome 2.14 (which is massively optimized)
2006-04-16T08:39:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	tanuki	yeah, it's quite easy
2006-04-16T08:39:00.000Z	tanuki	PuMpErNiCkLe	explain please
2006-04-16T08:40:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	tanuki	replace 'Breezy' with 'Dapper' in the /etc/apt/sources.list file, and then run 'sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade'
2006-04-16T08:43:00.000Z	tanuki	PuMpErNiCkLe	could you explain in further detail? what do you mean replace breezy with dapper?
2006-04-16T08:44:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	tanuki	/etc/apt/sources.list is a text file that holds a list of all the software repositories
2006-04-16T08:44:00.000Z	tanuki	PuMpErNiCkLe	ok
2006-04-16T08:44:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	tanuki	Replacing any occurrence of 'Breezy' with 'Dapper' will make it use the repositories holding the Dapper versions of all apps.
2006-04-16T08:44:00.000Z	tanuki	PuMpErNiCkLe	ok
2006-04-16T08:45:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	tanuki	'sudo apt-get dist-upgrade' is the command that upgrades your entire system
2006-04-16T08:45:00.000Z	tanuki	PuMpErNiCkLe	thank you, will i need to restart my computer or just log out to finish the changes?
2006-04-16T08:46:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	tanuki	You'll need to restart - it replaces basically everything, including the kernel.
2006-04-16T08:46:00.000Z	tanuki	PuMpErNiCkLe	ok, thank you
2006-04-16T08:46:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	tanuki	np :)
2006-04-16T08:46:00.000Z	tanuki	PuMpErNiCkLe	will it keep my current settings, like themes and such, or will i need to redo all that
2006-04-16T08:48:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	tanuki	It will keep your settings.  It doesn't touch your home directory, where most config files relating to your stuff are stored, and if any system config files have been changed it will ask you whether to keep the old version or go to the newer one.
2006-04-16T10:17:00.000Z	tanuki	PuMpErNiCkLe	you still there?
