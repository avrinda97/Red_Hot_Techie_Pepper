2010-01-15T14:37:00.000Z	DasEi	faheem_	look in htop what consumes it, install bum, disable uneeded services
2010-01-15T14:41:00.000Z	DasEi	faheem_	no prob andd speed up
2010-01-15T17:44:00.000Z	DasEi	faheem_	second
2010-01-15T17:44:00.000Z	faheem_	DasEi	Ok... waiting\
2010-01-15T17:45:00.000Z	DasEi	faheem_	following first link, I got ubuntu on a celeron 433 /128 MB run fair enough to use
2010-01-15T17:46:00.000Z	DasEi	faheem_	system specs ?
2010-01-15T17:48:00.000Z	DasEi	faheem_	boa, 1.2 ghz, least it'll have more space for ram then, with 256 you'll be fine in xubuntu
2010-01-15T17:50:00.000Z	DasEi	faheem_	see above lik, you get it superfast if you just do a minimal-install with no soft and then put icewm on it, plus needed software packages, but really on 128 one more ram rocks the world more than a lighter desk
2010-01-15T17:51:00.000Z	DasEi	faheem_	well, if it runs abov e a gig, sure can do 256 or more
2010-01-15T17:51:00.000Z	faheem_	DasEi	 ok.. im using xubuntu, cant i just configure it to stop using xfce and start using icewm
2010-01-15T17:52:00.000Z	DasEi	faheem_	yes
2010-01-15T17:53:00.000Z	DasEi	faheem_	uninstallaing xubuntu-desktop will lower backgraund taskas, though
2010-01-15T17:55:00.000Z	DasEi	faheem_	anyway, a  1,2 ghz / 256 can run a simple ubuntu,  too, though not 20 tasks and 4 vm's plus flash at at once
2010-01-15T17:56:00.000Z	faheem_	DasEi	seriously speaking your missing the point, laptop is too slow to run even the install process, left it overnight it was still on 22%
2010-01-15T17:57:00.000Z	DasEi	faheem_	that's another issue then, the specs are alright, if the bios/compatabiltiy or the cd drive/cd is, is sth else
2010-01-15T17:57:00.000Z	faheem_	DasEi	nevertheless xubuntu is working fine and i'd rather not mess around ubuntu
2010-01-15T17:58:00.000Z	DasEi	faheem_	with older hardware the alternate installer fixes many problems
2010-01-15T17:59:00.000Z	faheem_	DasEi	never looked at the alternte downlload will look into it
2010-01-15T18:04:00.000Z	faheem_	DasEi	shell is the same as terminal correct?
