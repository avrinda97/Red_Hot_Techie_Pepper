2007-04-18T11:14:00.000Z	mungewell	n00bie	- are you shure its a PCI device... sometimes they put internal devices on USB
2007-04-18T11:16:00.000Z	n00bie	mungewell	its a builtin bluetooth device
2007-04-18T11:16:00.000Z	mungewell	n00bie	-- but it *must* be connected to a bus somewhere. Repeat - sometimes they use internal USB connections....
