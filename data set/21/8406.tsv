2006-04-28T06:44:00.000Z	Madpilot	Apostle^	just a sec, there's a tutorial I've got bookmarked
2006-04-28T06:44:00.000Z	Apostle^	Madpilot	i thought it was just one app?
2006-04-28T06:44:00.000Z	Madpilot	Apostle^	it is, but there's a nice walkthru

2006-04-28T06:46:00.000Z	Apostle^	Madpilot	thanks
2006-04-28T06:47:00.000Z	Madpilot	Apostle^	yes
2006-04-28T06:47:00.000Z	Apostle^	Madpilot	if i go from mp3 to audio-cd then to flac thats just a waste isn't it? won't gain any quality
2006-04-28T06:47:00.000Z	Madpilot	Apostle^	no, you won't gain, only loose. For top quality, rip straight from CD to flac
2006-04-28T06:48:00.000Z	Madpilot	Apostle^	yes, I've used it for several hundred CDs so far with no issues at all
2006-04-28T06:51:00.000Z	Apostle^	Madpilot	it's too bad i hardly own any cd's lol.. all mp3
2006-04-28T10:55:00.000Z	Madpilot	Apostle^	the ATI ones
2006-04-28T10:56:00.000Z	Apostle^	Madpilot	im running the ATI ones and doom3 is choppy, i have a pci-express 256MB card.. this is crazy
2006-04-28T10:57:00.000Z	Apostle^	Madpilot	any ideas
2006-04-28T10:58:00.000Z	Madpilot	Apostle^	not really, I don't know anything about PCI-E
2006-04-28T10:58:00.000Z	Apostle^	Madpilot	i just wonder why doom3 runs bad
2006-04-28T11:00:00.000Z	Apostle^	Madpilot	if i were to just try the open source drivers i could switch back to ati after the test right?
2006-04-28T11:00:00.000Z	Madpilot	Apostle^	yes
2006-04-28T11:00:00.000Z	Apostle^	Madpilot	just reconfigure xorg and ctrl+altr+bspace right?
2006-04-28T11:01:00.000Z	Madpilot	Apostle^	probably - the fglrx stuff works for me, I've not had to do any experimenting
2006-04-28T11:01:00.000Z	Apostle^	Madpilot	the ati driver shows up as fglrx also in the xserver list, what do i choose?
