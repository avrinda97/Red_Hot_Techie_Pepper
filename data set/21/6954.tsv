2007-05-13T05:03:00.000Z	SoulChild		Hey Guys, can i copy the content of my "/boot"-Partition to the root dir and then format the Boot-artition without getting Problems on boot ?
2007-05-13T05:04:00.000Z	stefg	SoulChild	you've got to adapt /etc/fstab accordingly (delete the /boot entry so that no separate partition is assumed)
2007-05-13T05:04:00.000Z	SoulChild	stefg	ok thanks
2007-08-30T09:57:00.000Z	stefg	SoulChild	man grep
2007-08-30T10:01:00.000Z	stefg	SoulChild	inspect the 'kopt' option in /boot/grub/menu.lst. there are a lot of 'magic comments' in that file that determine how update-grub writes the kernel options
2007-08-30T10:01:00.000Z	SoulChild	stefg	ok, i'll check
2007-09-03T12:03:00.000Z	stefg	SoulChild	are you recompiling the kernel in order to get yur wireless working?
2007-09-03T12:04:00.000Z	SoulChild	stefg	no i simply want to compile the kernel to my needs ,...

2007-09-05T11:28:00.000Z	stefg	SoulChild	of course there is no general guide ... that completly depends on what hardware you have. If it wouldn't differ from box to box, it wouldn't be an option, but a builtin
2007-09-05T11:29:00.000Z	stefg	SoulChild	but you're learning what depends on what in the kernel. You'll need your disk-adapters supported for sure, and the filesystems you're using. Do you have a general understanding of hardware, the boot-process in linux and the initramfs-concept?
2007-09-05T11:31:00.000Z	SoulChild	stefg	everything except the initramfs ,... i deactivated and also didn't create it when i compiled my kernel, cause i want to built just the things in, that i need
2007-09-05T11:33:00.000Z	stefg	SoulChild	the initramfs is needed for a lot of things, and by no means a waste of resources. I'd suggest first to study the 'from power-up to bash prompt' howto, to get a general understanding. Although it's outdated, it still gives an idea of what's going on
2007-09-05T11:34:00.000Z	SoulChild	stefg	but do i really need a initramfs ?
2007-09-05T11:36:00.000Z	stefg	SoulChild	if you run usplash: yes. if you don't have /all/ modules needed to acces the root-fs statically built in the kernel: yes. If you want a non-modular, clumsy kernel: no!
2007-09-05T11:41:00.000Z	stefg	SoulChild	have you read http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=311158&highlight=master+kernel ?
2007-09-19T11:35:00.000Z	stefg	SoulChild	all modern computers use ACPI
2007-09-19T11:39:00.000Z	stefg	SoulChild	that depends on which hardware is present... no battery ,no thermal sensor ... no output
2008-05-29T02:44:00.000Z	stefg	SoulChild	sudo vim /etc/network/interfaces :)
2008-05-29T02:44:00.000Z	SoulChild	stefg	 :D
2008-05-29T02:44:00.000Z	SoulChild	stefg	maybe your r right, i should configure it to my needs
