2010-07-13T07:37:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl		OK, maybe I should ask a simpler question.  Does anyone know how to set up an internet connection share step-by-step (which is not the way the help page does it with the graphical set-up)?
2010-07-13T07:38:00.000Z	maco	jdsbluedevl	command line you mean?
2010-07-13T07:38:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	maco	no, command-line isn't working.  iptables doesn't work
2010-07-13T07:38:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	maco	I mean using the nm-applet
2010-07-13T07:38:00.000Z	maco	jdsbluedevl	oh... dunno
2010-07-13T07:39:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	maco	because it worked a month ago, then Ubuntu borked it
2010-07-13T07:39:00.000Z	maco	jdsbluedevl	if an update broke something PLEASE file a bug!
2010-07-13T07:39:00.000Z	maco	jdsbluedevl	like, ASAP, so we can revert it
2010-07-13T07:39:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	maco	problem is, I don't know what package it would be
2010-07-13T07:39:00.000Z	maco	jdsbluedevl	you say network manager could do connection sharing a month ago?
2010-07-13T07:40:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	maco	would it be network-manager?
2010-07-13T07:40:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	maco	yes
2010-07-13T07:40:00.000Z	maco	jdsbluedevl	in lucid?
2010-07-13T07:40:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	maco	yes
2010-07-13T07:40:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	maco	problem is that I can't get both Ethernet cards active at the same time
2010-07-13T07:41:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	maco	additional problem is that any connection profile I create is carried over with the main Internet connection to the other card
2010-07-13T07:41:00.000Z	maco	jdsbluedevl	ok, network-manager package hasnt changed since april
2010-07-13T07:42:00.000Z	maco	jdsbluedevl	lemme check the nm gnome one
2010-07-13T07:42:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	maco	maybe I should check a second connection client other than my Roku?  Only other one I know of is my laptop
2010-07-13T07:43:00.000Z	maco	jdsbluedevl	hmm thats from the same source package so hasnt changed eiher...
2010-07-13T07:46:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	maco	gotta restart network-manager, might be on to something with connecting to my laptop
