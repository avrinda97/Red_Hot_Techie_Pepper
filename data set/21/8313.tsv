2006-09-08T12:00:00.000Z	holycow	jshriver	ubuntu freezes debian unstable every 6 months
2006-09-08T12:00:00.000Z	jshriver	holycow	?
2006-09-08T12:01:00.000Z	holycow	jshriver	effectively ubuntu is debian + modifications 10 million per year buys you
2006-09-08T12:01:00.000Z	holycow	jshriver	dude stop saying shit you don't understand
2006-09-08T12:01:00.000Z	jshriver	holycow	either way Ubuntu has more software available via apt-get than Debian..
2006-09-08T12:01:00.000Z	holycow	jshriver	the exact same software from debian is in ubuntu
2006-09-08T12:02:00.000Z	jshriver	holycow	then tell me .. how do I apt-get install the binary only Nvidia drivers for my card.. in Debian? can do it in Ubuntu using the non-free section? ...
2006-09-08T12:05:00.000Z	holycow	jshriver	ubuntyu repos = debian repost ,its that simple
2006-09-08T12:06:00.000Z	holycow	jshriver	having a handfull of prepackaged apps that you can also get installed on debian with a few extra commands is not really saying IT HAS MORE SOFTWARE
2006-09-08T12:06:00.000Z	holycow	jshriver	ubuntu and debian old timers are telling you they are the same, therefore they are
2006-09-08T12:07:00.000Z	holycow	jshriver	its not about right or wrong, its about listening.  some things are well known, comming into this channel claiming somiething that is clearly wrong simply requires a little bit of humbleness to consider that you might indeed be wrong
2006-09-08T12:09:00.000Z	holycow	jshriver	debian isn't all about gpl
2006-09-08T12:10:00.000Z	holycow	jshriver	then how can you possible be saying such stupid things?
2006-09-08T12:10:00.000Z	holycow	jshriver	i don't believe for one second that you run debian
2006-09-08T12:11:00.000Z	jshriver	holycow	hrm.. why else do you think I chose Debian? I've been running Linux since '95, started debian around 01.. fel in love with apt-get :) and dpkg...a friend gave me an ubuntu CD.. and it fixed some problems I was having with Debian.
2006-09-08T12:19:00.000Z	holycow	jshriver	no, it never will be
2006-09-08T12:19:00.000Z	holycow	jshriver	it will implement whatever has or will become a free spec
