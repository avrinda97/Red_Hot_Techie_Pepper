2007-12-19T02:51:00.000Z	soccer_hawk10	Jack_Sparrow	does gdesklets play nicely with compiz?
2007-12-19T02:51:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	soccer_hawk10	no idea...
2007-12-19T05:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	soccer_hawk10	Have you used NON-ubuntu repos...  what all have you installed.. is this a laptop or desktop etc
2007-12-19T05:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	soccer_hawk10	have you tried turning off effects?
2007-12-19T05:09:00.000Z	soccer_hawk10	Jack_Sparrow	well, the trouble with that is that i can't guess when these things will freeze
2007-12-19T05:09:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	soccer_hawk10	Worth your time to turn it off and wait then..
2007-12-19T05:10:00.000Z	soccer_hawk10	Jack_Sparrow	well, the thing is, i never had trouble until i changed my screen resolution...
2007-12-19T05:10:00.000Z	soccer_hawk10	Jack_Sparrow	i don't know if that's what caused it or what... and i really love compiz, i'd kill me to remove it
2007-12-19T05:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	soccer_hawk10	those "Cute Effects" can cause a multitude of problems...
2007-12-19T05:11:00.000Z	soccer_hawk10	Jack_Sparrow	do you use them?
2007-12-19T05:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	soccer_hawk10	Then I cant help you.. turn off the effects long enough to see if that is the problem...   But I seem to remember looking at your sources page and you have installed things from outside the repos
2007-12-19T05:12:00.000Z	soccer_hawk10	Jack_Sparrow	i don't think you've seen my sources page since i've never posted it...
2007-12-19T05:12:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	soccer_hawk10	Must have been a similar nick..
2007-12-19T05:13:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	soccer_hawk10	with tens of thousands of lines in here per day... I sometimes get confused..
2007-12-19T05:13:00.000Z	soccer_hawk10	Jack_Sparrow	don't sweat it, i know you're just trying to help
2007-12-19T05:34:00.000Z	soccer_hawk10	Jack_Sparrow	in my xorg.conf i didn't have the option "aiglx" "true" in there under serverlayout
2008-12-14T02:12:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	soccer_hawk10	Please hold down on the repeats, every couple minutes is plenty in a busy channel
