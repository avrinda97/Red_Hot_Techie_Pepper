2010-06-15T18:34:00.000Z	anirvana		someone please help me cure this error : "Kernel :panic-not syncing:VFS:Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block[8,5]" . :(
2010-06-15T18:35:00.000Z	piko	anirvana	hello, it seems your linux can not boot as it does not find its root partition
2010-06-15T18:36:00.000Z	anirvana	piko	, exactly It can't and I have a hell lot of work stuck inside it :(
2010-06-15T18:36:00.000Z	anirvana	piko	, This happened after I installed wireless driver into it
2010-06-15T18:38:00.000Z	piko	anirvana	well, first, you need to run another linux on the machine, so burn a live linux cd if you do not have one and boot to it
2010-06-15T18:39:00.000Z	anirvana	piko	, Can't I repair the existing one?
2010-06-15T18:40:00.000Z	piko	anirvana	of course yes, the live distro is just to get booted, then you can mount existing partition and correct the mistake in grub configuration and all will be ok
2010-06-15T18:41:00.000Z	anirvana	piko	, Do I need to reinstall ubuntu all over again?
2010-06-15T18:41:00.000Z	piko	anirvana	also, probably try to start other grub entries (recovery lines, other kernels)
2010-06-15T18:41:00.000Z	piko	anirvana	not
2010-06-15T18:42:00.000Z	piko	anirvana	if your partion is okay (which is the most likely case) then your installation/data ... will be preserved, this is just a way how to get to the system and repair the configuration
2010-06-15T18:55:00.000Z	piko	anirvana	good, then paste somewhere your menu.lst
2010-06-15T18:56:00.000Z	piko	anirvana	more precisely /boot/grub/menu.lst
2010-06-15T18:57:00.000Z	piko	anirvana	jsut to bude sure, what version of grub are you using? grub-legacy or grub2_
2010-06-15T18:59:00.000Z	anirvana	piko	, Ah I will have to reboot to try this command.I have a dual boot system
2010-06-15T19:00:00.000Z	anirvana	piko	Can you tell me the steps to make my new krnel working?
2010-06-15T19:00:00.000Z	piko	anirvana	no problem, I am here, just quote me
2010-06-15T19:00:00.000Z	piko	anirvana	wait
2010-06-15T19:02:00.000Z	piko	anirvana	first, paste the menu.lst, then check if there is not any discrepancy like diferent root= ... if initramfs image is present ... then try dpkg-reconfigure <kernel-package-name> to check if there are no errors in this phase
2010-06-15T19:02:00.000Z	piko	anirvana	then we can try something more
2010-06-15T20:53:00.000Z	anirvana	piko	, DO you have any solution to panic kernel problem?
