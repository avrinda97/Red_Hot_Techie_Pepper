2010-08-17T16:52:00.000Z	WXZ		nope
2010-08-17T16:52:00.000Z	WXZ		can I get cronjob to send a command to terminal though?
2010-08-17T16:52:00.000Z	WXZ		something like terminal --command="command"?
2010-08-17T16:53:00.000Z	WXZ		that's the only work around I see
2010-08-17T16:54:00.000Z	WXZ		reading docs on it
2010-08-17T16:54:00.000Z	phlak_user	WXZ	does the command have to run in a terminal (meaning foreground?)
2010-08-17T16:54:00.000Z	WXZ		no
2010-08-17T16:55:00.000Z	phlak_user	WXZ	ok so is it possible that you get crontab to execute a command and send the output to notification area via libnotify?
2010-08-17T16:55:00.000Z	WXZ		I don't know what the notification area is
2010-08-17T16:56:00.000Z	phlak_user	WXZ	top right hand corner of panel in Gnome Session
2010-08-17T16:56:00.000Z	WXZ		ok, nevermind
2010-08-17T16:56:00.000Z	WXZ		phlak, I'm trying to send a "command" to the terminal
2010-08-17T16:56:00.000Z	WXZ		as a workaround for cron not communicating well with tomboy
2010-08-17T16:57:00.000Z	phlak_user	WXZ	are you trying to launch tomboy through a script that cron will execute?
2010-08-17T16:57:00.000Z	WXZ	phlak_user	yes, I'm trying to get a note to pop up
2010-08-17T16:58:00.000Z	WXZ		long story short, it doesn't pop up
2010-08-17T16:58:00.000Z	phlak_user	WXZ	wouldnt it be easier to use the Tomboy D-bus interface to do this?
2010-08-17T16:58:00.000Z	phlak_user	WXZ	like this article says --> http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2007/09/using-the-tomboy-d-bus-interface.ars
2010-08-17T16:59:00.000Z	WXZ		so write a python script
2010-08-17T17:00:00.000Z	WXZ		and launch that python script?
2010-08-17T17:01:00.000Z	phlak_user	WXZ	yes
