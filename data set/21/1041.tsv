2011-11-13T01:01:00.000Z	Cataclysm		hi i have a dual boot. when i use 'locate' it only searches my host machine. how can i make it work only on my ubuntu install?
2011-11-13T01:02:00.000Z	Cataclysm		anyone know why "locate" is only searching my host machine on my dual boot?
2011-11-13T01:03:00.000Z	DexterF	Cataclysm	maybe updatedb.conf is set to ignore ntfs. I think I saw something like that on a fresh inst. check that.
2011-11-13T01:03:00.000Z	Cataclysm		thanks DexterF i'll take a look
2011-11-13T01:04:00.000Z	Cataclysm	DexterF	it only lists ntfs4 -- bad?
2011-11-13T01:04:00.000Z	DexterF	Cataclysm	you sure? that not nfs4?
2011-11-13T01:05:00.000Z	Cataclysm		oops, "nfs4" there is no mention of ntfs
2011-11-13T01:05:00.000Z	Cataclysm		many others though
2011-11-13T01:06:00.000Z	DexterF	Cataclysm	ntfs mounts are auto mounted at boot time?
2011-11-13T01:06:00.000Z	Cataclysm		Sorry DexterF I'm not sure
2011-11-13T01:06:00.000Z	DexterF	Cataclysm	check fstab fi your ntfs mounts have the "auto" flag
2011-11-13T01:12:00.000Z	Cataclysm	DexterF	: i used "sudo updatedb" and now it shows both host files and my ubuntu files. any easy way to disable searching on host machine?
2011-11-13T01:13:00.000Z	DexterF	Cataclysm	define "host" - the linux installation?
2011-11-13T01:13:00.000Z	Cataclysm	DexterF	- my WIndows install :)
2011-11-13T01:13:00.000Z	Cataclysm		may i message you? this is a new install and my irc client is obnoxious DexterF
2011-11-13T01:13:00.000Z	DexterF	Cataclysm	put the windows mount point in the "prunepath" var in updatedb.conf
2011-11-13T01:15:00.000Z	DexterF	Cataclysm	well, just install xchat or konversation
2011-11-13T01:15:00.000Z	Cataclysm	DexterF	you are a gentleman and a scholar thanks so much for your help
2011-11-13T01:15:00.000Z	Cataclysm	DexterF	will do :)
2011-11-13T01:15:00.000Z	Cataclysm		works now
2011-11-13T01:15:00.000Z	DexterF	Cataclysm	I've been called many things, but "gentlemen" was never amongst them :D
