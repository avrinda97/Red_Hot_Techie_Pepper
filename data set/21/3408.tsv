2012-04-16T08:22:00.000Z	Almagest		Who here can help someone with a seemingly unsolvable problem!!!???
2012-04-16T08:22:00.000Z	Almagest		So check it
2012-04-16T08:23:00.000Z	Almagest		My friends hard drive is fried, so im trying to boot Ubuntu onto the pc from a Flash drive.
2012-04-16T08:23:00.000Z	Almagest		Possible correct?
2012-04-16T08:23:00.000Z	Almagest		It does
2012-04-16T08:23:00.000Z	Almagest		Now then
2012-04-16T08:23:00.000Z	Almagest		I have the flash correctly set up
2012-04-16T08:23:00.000Z	sacarlson	Almagest	easy plug and play maybe some bios setting to enable usb boot
2012-04-16T08:25:00.000Z	sacarlson	Almagest	message that states what?  might be it tries to boot from hard disk first so will fail,  change the boot sequence so usb boots first
2012-04-16T08:26:00.000Z	sacarlson	Almagest	so you will have to boot into bios setting mode to change boot sequence
2012-04-16T08:28:00.000Z	sacarlson	Almagest	is this ubuntu?
2012-04-16T08:29:00.000Z	sacarlson	Almagest	can the usb flash disk boot on any other systems?
2012-04-16T08:33:00.000Z	sacarlson	Almagest	does the usb flash boot on another computer?  what software method did you use to install the iso file on the usb flash disk?
2012-04-16T08:35:00.000Z	sacarlson	Almagest	and reading back I don't see what version you have installed.  if you have a system to program the usb flash you should try to test the usb flash boot on that system to isolate the problem
2012-04-16T08:35:00.000Z	sacarlson	Almagest	version of ubuntu iso's you tried
2012-04-16T08:38:00.000Z	sacarlson	Almagest	well then have them try it on the system you use as the remote
2012-04-16T08:39:00.000Z	sacarlson	Almagest	I've never seen your problem so I would have to first isolate
2012-04-16T08:42:00.000Z	sacarlson	Almagest	oh then maybe you might need something like a 32bit lubuntu iso to test it on that also
2012-04-16T08:42:00.000Z	sacarlson	Almagest	I would start from lubuntu 10.04  32bit  and work up from there if needed
2012-04-16T08:44:00.000Z	sacarlson	Almagest	a 2001 system I don't think will boot a standard ubuntu 10.04  probly not enuf mem
2012-04-16T08:49:00.000Z	sacarlson	Almagest	oh 2010 hp could be a it has an efi bios,  I wonder how those boot from usb
