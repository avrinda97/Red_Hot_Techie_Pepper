2008-04-26T22:56:00.000Z	keycool1	amenado	would my card be the aironet 350 mini-pci wireless lan client adapter or the aironet 350 wireless lan client adapter?
2008-04-26T22:59:00.000Z	keycool1	amenado	ok great thanks for the patience, I know I don't know my way around that well. It looks like its the mini PCI card. I have the link for the driver, but it only offers my windows 2000 and win xp options
