2005-03-23T08:52:00.000Z	bob2	The-Ghost|afk	just install it
2005-03-23T08:52:00.000Z	bob2	The-Ghost|afk	then something else is broken
2005-03-23T08:54:00.000Z	bob2	The-Ghost|afk	it doesn't matter.  just tell windows to nuke the disk.
2005-03-23T08:57:00.000Z	bob2	The-Ghost|afk	then nuke the partitions or something
2005-03-23T08:58:00.000Z	bob2	The-Ghost|afk	this sounds an awful lot like a windows problem
2005-03-23T08:59:00.000Z	bob2	The-Ghost|afk	please try to use " " instead of hitting enter after every word
2005-03-23T09:02:00.000Z	bob2	The-Ghost|afk	please?  we know you have problems, but afaict they are with windows, not ubuntu.
