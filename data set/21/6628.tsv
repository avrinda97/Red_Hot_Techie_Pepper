2008-02-01T08:20:00.000Z	ToddEDM		hey  how do i make a shortcut on my desktop to a program that i have to start in the terminal
2008-02-01T08:21:00.000Z	cellofellow	ToddEDM	edit the launcher and put it as a "Terminal" program.
2008-02-01T08:21:00.000Z	ToddEDM	cellofellow	 you might have guessed.. im a newb
2008-02-01T08:21:00.000Z	cellofellow	ToddEDM	let me check the exact proceedure.
2008-02-01T08:23:00.000Z	cellofellow	ToddEDM	turns out to be a bit trickier than I thought. (Was easier in XFCE than GNOME, but I keep forgetting that I liked that desktop better.)
2008-02-01T08:23:00.000Z	cellofellow	ToddEDM	Applications -> Acessories -> Terminal
2008-02-01T08:24:00.000Z	cellofellow	ToddEDM	cd Desktop/; ls
2008-02-01T08:25:00.000Z	cellofellow	ToddEDM	Launcher files are *.desktop. They are similarish to *.lnk files in Windoze.
2008-02-01T08:26:00.000Z	cellofellow	ToddEDM	Open one with gedit thefile.desktop
2008-02-01T08:26:00.000Z	cellofellow	ToddEDM	they are just text files.
2008-02-01T08:26:00.000Z	cellofellow	ToddEDM	you can drag and drop them from the menu or panel to the desktop.
2008-02-01T08:27:00.000Z	cellofellow	ToddEDM	that works too.
2008-02-01T08:27:00.000Z	cellofellow	ToddEDM	There is a line in it that should read "Terminal=false", change it to "true".
2008-02-01T08:27:00.000Z	cellofellow	ToddEDM	yeah, that's Exec=command
2008-02-01T08:29:00.000Z	cellofellow	ToddEDM	working out?
2008-02-01T08:29:00.000Z	ToddEDM	cellofellow	 its just asking me for COMMAND.. then there is a field to type in something
2008-02-01T08:30:00.000Z	cellofellow	ToddEDM	ah, here's the easy way. Right click the desktop, create launcher. There is a drop-down box that says Application, in there select Terminal Application.
2008-02-01T08:30:00.000Z	cellofellow	ToddEDM	then there is Name, Command, and Comment boxes.
2008-02-01T08:30:00.000Z	cellofellow	ToddEDM	and you can click the icon to change it.
2008-02-01T08:31:00.000Z	cellofellow	ToddEDM	for some reason I thought you wanted to terminal-ize an already existing launcher.
2008-02-01T08:32:00.000Z	cellofellow	ToddEDM	you are welcome :)
