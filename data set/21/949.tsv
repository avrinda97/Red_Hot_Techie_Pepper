2011-03-31T04:06:00.000Z	Stelpa		Selling open source stuff
2011-03-31T04:06:00.000Z	Stelpa		Gimp was on the list too, btw
2011-03-31T04:07:00.000Z	Stelpa		:\
2011-03-31T04:07:00.000Z	Stelpa		i suppose
2011-03-31T04:07:00.000Z	Stelpa		thanks for letting me know :)
2011-03-31T04:07:00.000Z	Stelpa		its a bit of an injustice, though
2011-03-31T04:07:00.000Z	Stelpa		it was probably a 2gb drive, and they were selling it for like 20 bucks because of the "state of the art software" included
2011-03-31T04:07:00.000Z	Stelpa		its ridiculous >_<
2011-03-31T04:08:00.000Z	Stelpa		there was a similar "games pack" which had the exact same idea
2011-03-31T04:09:00.000Z	Stelpa		Just a bunch of open source games being sold for 25 bucks on a tiny usb drive
2011-03-31T04:10:00.000Z	brightspark	Stelpa	as far as I know, you can sell the stuff under GPL if you want to.  Of course, nothing prevents potential buyers from just going and downloading it for free.
2011-03-31T04:12:00.000Z	Stelpa	brightspark	we need to go out there and put notes on the back of all those things saying that you can download them all free online
2011-03-31T04:12:00.000Z	Stelpa		because the packaging certainly doesn't mention that
2011-03-31T04:13:00.000Z	brightspark	Stelpa	well of course the packaging won't say that!  and I'd encourage you to read http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.html
2011-03-31T04:15:00.000Z	Stelpa		thanks, brightspark :)
2011-03-31T04:16:00.000Z	Stelpa		i understand the philosophy... its just, it feels bad to know so many people out there are getting ripped off by a company selling other people's work when its out there for free
2011-03-31T04:16:00.000Z	brightspark	Stelpa	no problem.  In fact, I think it's good that they are distributing free software more than it is bad that they charge for it.
2011-03-31T04:17:00.000Z	Stelpa		its like selling copied paintings, when they are out there for free on the internet in high res anyway
2011-03-31T04:17:00.000Z	Stelpa		and thats not even a perfect analogy >_<
2011-03-31T04:19:00.000Z	brightspark	Stelpa	 I get what you mean.  If this was a concern to the authors, they would probably choose to licence it under something like the creative commons noncommercial licence.
2011-03-31T04:21:00.000Z	Stelpa	brightspark	ahh, forgot about that license
