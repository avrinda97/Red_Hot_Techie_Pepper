2008-04-05T03:53:00.000Z	Xorothal		tiny proxy is not working
2008-04-05T03:54:00.000Z	Xorothal		can someone help me configure tinyproxy?
2008-04-05T03:55:00.000Z	Xorothal		I'm "getting the proxy is refusing connections" from ff when I access it from 172.168.0.3 (I am on 172.168.0.2)
2008-04-05T03:56:00.000Z	Xorothal		HELLO?
2008-04-05T03:56:00.000Z	unop_	Xorothal	is 172.168.0.0 your LAN addressing scheme?
2008-04-05T03:57:00.000Z	Xorothal	unop_	yes
2008-04-05T03:58:00.000Z	Xorothal	unop_	but I have static IPs
2008-04-05T03:58:00.000Z	unop_	Xorothal	well that could be your problem -- 172.168.0.0 is not for private/LAN use, it is a public address range -- you should change that to use addresses within the range of - 172.16.0.0 - 172.32.255.255
2008-04-05T03:59:00.000Z	Xorothal	unop_	I didn't realise, I thought it was private
2008-04-05T04:00:00.000Z	unop_	Xorothal	and this is an educated guess - your proxy server is denying connections to it because it thinks traffic is originating from out on the internet rather than your LAN
2008-04-05T04:03:00.000Z	Xorothal	unop_	I've just set it all up so that it's 193. etc and it still doesn't work
2008-04-05T04:04:00.000Z	Xorothal	unop_	is gone
2008-04-05T04:05:00.000Z	unop_	Xorothal	193.x.x.x is also public -- use one of 10.x.x.x, 172.16.x.x-172.32.x.x or 192.168.x.x
2008-04-05T04:09:00.000Z	Xorothal	unop_	I'm now on 172.168.0.2 and it's working! thanks so much
2008-04-05T04:10:00.000Z	unop_	Xorothal	you werent listening.. you are bound to bump into other problems if you continue using that address range
2008-04-05T04:11:00.000Z	Xorothal	unop_	sorry, I meant 172.16.0.2
2008-04-05T04:11:00.000Z	unop_	Xorothal	right right, thats better :)
2008-04-05T04:21:00.000Z	unop_	Xorothal	dont take this the wrong way, you can ask !google that question :)
2008-04-05T04:23:00.000Z	unop_	Xorothal	well, i typed this out in google and surprise, surprise - http://www.google.co.uk/search?complete=1&hl=en&q=disable+ubuntu+splash+screen&btnG=Google+Search&meta=&aq=f
2008-04-05T04:24:00.000Z	Xorothal	unop_	no I mean I should have asked google
2008-04-05T04:24:00.000Z	unop_	Xorothal	ohh yea, sometimes google is better, faster, easier to work with than actual humans :)
