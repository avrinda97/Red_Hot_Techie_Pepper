2009-10-17T09:09:00.000Z	datz		Hi, I'm trying to sort out a problem of no sound with the browser if the media player is open, and no sound with the media player if the browser is open and has played sound. Can someone help me?
2009-10-17T09:09:00.000Z	MikeChelen	datz	do you know what sound card you have?
2009-10-17T09:09:00.000Z	datz	MikeChelen	I'm not certain
2009-10-17T09:10:00.000Z	MikeChelen	datz	which media players have you tried?
2009-10-17T09:14:00.000Z	MikeChelen	datz	maybe try OSS with http://packages.ubuntu.com/jaunty/flashplugin-nonfree-extrasound ? no guarantees :)
2009-10-17T09:15:00.000Z	datz	MikeChelen	thanks, taking a look
2009-10-17T09:17:00.000Z	datz	MikeChelen	sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree-extrasound  ?
2009-10-17T09:23:00.000Z	datz	MikeChelen	looking for the audio chip, the board is a GA-P35-DS3L
2009-10-17T09:23:00.000Z	MikeChelen	datz	who is the manufacturer?
2009-10-17T09:25:00.000Z	datz	MikeChelen	 Realtek ALC888
2009-10-17T10:05:00.000Z	datz	MikeChelen	Magnesium, no other thoughts?
2009-10-17T10:07:00.000Z	MikeChelen	datz	did pulse work for regular audio?
2009-10-17T10:07:00.000Z	datz	MikeChelen	yes
2009-10-17T10:10:00.000Z	datz	MikeChelen	this is a common problem, or one only for my chipset?
2009-10-17T10:11:00.000Z	MikeChelen	datz	there is likely some workaround, unsure what it might be though
2009-10-17T10:12:00.000Z	MikeChelen	datz	so flash worked okay with pulseaudio?
2009-10-17T10:13:00.000Z	MikeChelen	datz	ah ok, so flash audio did not work at all with pulseaudio
2009-10-17T10:14:00.000Z	datz	MikeChelen	well, I suspect if I had closed the media player, it would have worked
2009-10-17T10:16:00.000Z	MikeChelen	datz	its just hard because maybe pulseaudio was not working with flash at all
2009-10-17T10:16:00.000Z	datz	MikeChelen	I really should have tried to use pulse seperatly..I did not
2009-10-17T10:17:00.000Z	MikeChelen	datz	yeah check the same thing with alsa
