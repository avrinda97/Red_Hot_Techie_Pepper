2006-07-25T14:01:00.000Z	Intangir	Dev05	you might want samba
2006-07-25T14:01:00.000Z	Dev05	Intangir	I just want my windows laptop to use Ubuntu's internet connection.
2006-07-25T14:02:00.000Z	Intangir	Dev05	how are they both connected to eachother? and the internet?
2006-07-25T14:03:00.000Z	Dev05	Intangir	Whyvas, Ubuntu connects through Ethernet to Internet. Windows is supposed to connect trough Wireless to Ubuntu and use its Internet connection.
2006-07-25T14:03:00.000Z	Intangir	Dev05	so your using the linux box as a router for it? i think there is something like iptables to do something like that ,but ive never done it
2006-07-25T14:04:00.000Z	Dev05	Intangir	Yeah...
2006-07-25T14:06:00.000Z	Intangir	Dev05	just go buy a wireless router, with a some ehternet ports too, thats the easiest way, they are only like 30 bucks
2006-07-25T14:08:00.000Z	Dev05	Intangir	I'd be glad if you could convince my father to do so :). He doesn't like Linux and he won't buy a router just for that... :(
2006-07-25T14:08:00.000Z	Intangir	Dev05	how do you get onto the internet with the windows machine?
2006-07-25T14:10:00.000Z	Dev05	Intangir	I would normally start windows xp and give connectivity to the laptop. But now I got dual-boot with Ubuntu.
2006-07-25T14:10:00.000Z	Intangir	Dev05	ok just check out that "iptables" "route" and first check out iwconfig to set up your wireless card
2006-07-25T14:13:00.000Z	Dev05	Intangir	If I tell him he will just say "Reinstall Windows and don't bother!"
2006-07-25T14:14:00.000Z	Dev05	Intangir	But how do I make the machines see themselves, even though I've set routing up?
2006-07-25T14:15:00.000Z	Intangir	Dev05	overwireless? you have to set your wireless settings, and set the linux box to AP
2006-07-25T14:15:00.000Z	Dev05	Intangir	I did, it just doesn't work :(
2006-07-25T14:16:00.000Z	Dev05	Intangir	Also, it is an Ad-Hoc Network. That made the difference between working and not-working on Windows...
2006-07-25T14:16:00.000Z	Intangir	Dev05	sorry i cant be much more help i have never had to set that up myself
2006-07-25T14:17:00.000Z	Intangir	Dev05	my wireless computers just connect thru the wireless router i bought ;)
2006-07-25T14:17:00.000Z	Intangir	Dev05	tell your dad having a real firewall will protect his shitty windows box from viruses and exploits more
2006-07-25T14:17:00.000Z	Intangir	Dev05	being right off the modem means any ports he has open could potentially be exploited
2006-07-25T14:18:00.000Z	Dev05	Intangir	No, he connects through MY pc...
