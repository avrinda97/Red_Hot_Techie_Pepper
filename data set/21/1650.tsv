2010-06-26T09:47:00.000Z	Viking667		and mplayer works like this:    mplayer yourfile.wav
2010-06-26T09:47:00.000Z	Viking667		ahhh. Then you need extra plugins
2010-06-26T09:48:00.000Z	Viking667		has win32 in the name, but I can't remember its name exactly

2010-06-26T10:02:00.000Z	Pina	Viking667	by synaptic
2010-06-26T10:04:00.000Z	Viking667	Pina	could you tell me what this says when yo utype it in a terminal:   which gmplayer
2010-06-26T10:05:00.000Z	Pina	Viking667	it returns a dir.. /usr/bin/gmplayer
2010-06-26T10:06:00.000Z	Pina	Viking667	but stills not appearing in multimedia, or any of the others labels.. :/
2010-06-26T10:07:00.000Z	Viking667	Pina	have a hunt. If in doubt, log out, log back in. Sometimes the menus need a re-hash.
