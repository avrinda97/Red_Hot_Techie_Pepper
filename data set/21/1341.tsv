2010-10-16T16:43:00.000Z	CrackerJackz		from what i was reading when you install dsl to hd you use apt-get for package management
2010-10-16T16:43:00.000Z	CrackerJackz		so what all can i do to light up my ubuntu install?
2010-10-16T16:44:00.000Z	CrackerJackz		lighten*
2010-10-16T16:46:00.000Z	CrackerJackz		so i was thinking firefox, audacious, open office
2010-10-16T16:46:00.000Z	CrackerJackz		just the OS it's self
2010-10-16T16:47:00.000Z	CrackerJackz		and i'll have to make a 256 mb swap
2010-10-16T16:47:00.000Z	CrackerJackz		you think i could get by with 128?
2010-10-16T16:48:00.000Z	CrackerJackz		nation yes
2010-10-16T16:50:00.000Z	CrackerJackz		lemme check
2010-10-16T16:51:00.000Z	CrackerJackz		i mean.. right now it has windows xp on it
2010-10-16T16:51:00.000Z	mantz	CrackerJackz	how much RAM?
2010-10-16T16:52:00.000Z	CrackerJackz	mantz	128 mb
2010-10-16T16:52:00.000Z	mantz	CrackerJackz	xubuntu is the most you can use. more likely lxde
2010-10-16T16:52:00.000Z	CrackerJackz	mantz	what wm does xubuntu use?
2010-10-16T16:53:00.000Z	mantz	CrackerJackz	xfce
2010-10-16T16:53:00.000Z	CrackerJackz	mantz	i was thinking of just using fluxbox
2010-10-16T16:54:00.000Z	mantz	CrackerJackz	that's even better. but: if you don't use the ubuntu desktops, there is no real reason using ubuntu imho. use another, small distro like puppy, dsl or debian (imho)
2010-10-16T16:56:00.000Z	mantz	CrackerJackz	giving someone who has no clue about computing fluxbox is not a good idea imho :)
2010-10-16T16:56:00.000Z	CrackerJackz	mantz	i was thinking that too but man it'd be so fast
2010-10-16T17:00:00.000Z	mantz	CrackerJackz	forget java.
2010-10-16T17:01:00.000Z	mantz	CrackerJackz	forget it. windowmaker (on a stripped down debian, not a fairly bloated ubuntu) plus firefox without flash and the RAM was full on a 128MB machine I once used
