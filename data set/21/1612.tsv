2010-07-01T10:25:00.000Z	sianhulo		what is wrong with ubuntu =(?
2010-07-01T10:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sianhulo	imho, too many apps installed by default
2010-07-01T10:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sianhulo	is all that in the livecd?
2010-07-01T10:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sianhulo	do you have web access?
2010-07-01T10:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sianhulo	anything outside your lan. Can you access it?
2010-07-01T10:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sianhulo	ok how do you connect? Wired or wireless?
2010-07-01T10:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sianhulo	how is it the /home partition affecting web access?
2010-07-01T10:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sianhulo	does your network interface get an ip. If you run: ifconfig ,you will see all interfaces and their info. Does yours have an ip address?
2010-07-01T10:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sianhulo	ahh. Ok. So are these archives on the /home partition?
2010-07-01T10:36:00.000Z	sianhulo	ActionParsnip	yes
2010-07-01T10:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sianhulo	ok then you need to add the home partition in /etc/fstab and it will be mounted. You needed to add the partition to the setup when you reinstalled but marked it to NOT be formatted and it would be mounted for you appropriately
2010-07-01T10:39:00.000Z	sianhulo	ActionParsnip	 i only had formated "/" partition,but not /home partition
2010-07-01T10:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sianhulo	yes that is what you needed to do but you also needed to change the home partition, mark it as the filesystem it previously used and mark it to be used as /home but not formatted
2010-07-01T10:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sianhulo	if you did it would be mounted now as it was before the reinstall
2010-07-01T10:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sianhulo	you now need to manually edit /etc/fstab to add a line for /home. If someone has a seperate home partition the could give you the line. You will need to run: sudo blkid ,yours will be the only difference to that line
2010-07-01T10:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sianhulo	if I was home I could give you mine but I'm on my phone outta town so no can do
2010-07-01T10:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sianhulo	I'm sure someone will give theirs if you ask ;)
2010-07-01T11:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sianhulo	if you run: mount ,does it show the partition mounted to /home?
2010-07-01T11:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sianhulo	cool, that's a good sign :)
2010-07-01T11:13:00.000Z	sianhulo	ActionParsnip	uuid on fstab an blkid agree,and i didnt change it
2012-08-12T00:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sianhulo	if you add the playdeb repo, do these apps help: http://www.playdeb.net/updates/ubuntu/12.04/?q=joy
