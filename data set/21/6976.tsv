2008-09-07T23:36:00.000Z	Azazel-A2		try to change volume.  do you have the volume control on menu bar?
2008-09-07T23:37:00.000Z	Azazel-A2		actually first. I want you to verfiy if the module is loaded.
2008-09-07T23:37:00.000Z	Azazel-A2		open terminal and type: sudo -s again
2008-09-07T23:38:00.000Z	Azazel-A2		lsmod | grep -i snd
2008-09-07T23:39:00.000Z	Azazel-A2		snd-intel etc things like that
2008-09-07T23:40:00.000Z	Azazel-A2		apt-get install linux-backports-modules
2008-09-07T23:40:00.000Z	Azazel-A2		 and reboot fixed problem in gutsy
2008-09-07T23:41:00.000Z	Azazel-A2		try that.  its very basic and poster says it worked
2008-09-07T23:41:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Azazel-A2	yeah it did... but it should work out of the box in Hardy, at least it has for me
2008-09-07T23:50:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Azazel-A2	yes
2008-09-07T23:56:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Azazel-A2	would seem so.
2008-09-08T00:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Azazel-A2	not the same machine, just the same device, honestly, it should work otu of the box.
2008-09-08T00:03:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Azazel-A2	well, we'll see if this works when he gets back... honestly, it should
2008-09-08T00:05:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Azazel-A2	i didn't think youd id.
2008-09-08T00:08:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Azazel-A2	i had him add that line, but model=acer(since that worked for my device)
2008-09-08T00:09:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Azazel-A2	Judgegeo remove that line that Azazel-A2 told you to add before, and just leave the line i gave yo uthere, and restart
2008-09-08T00:21:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Azazel-A2	well, you should use gksudo.. tis n ot cuz i like it..lol
2008-09-08T00:23:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Azazel-A2	yeah, i think i've read that before.
2008-09-08T00:24:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Azazel-A2	strange thing though, most of that, is for Gutsy, this should work fine in hardy
2008-09-08T00:33:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Azazel-A2	thats interesting, hard to understand why it doesn't work w/ hardy though
