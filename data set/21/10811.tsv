2005-08-02T07:09:00.000Z	nothingsometing		.............now what was that mfw................. i need the what, and your sure that will make konqueror my default file browser
2005-08-02T07:10:00.000Z	thoreauputic	nothingsometing	making konq default in gnome is kind of - pushing s**t uphill IMO
2005-08-02T07:10:00.000Z	thoreauputic	nothingsometing	if you prefer konq you are better off with KDE
2005-08-02T07:11:00.000Z	thoreauputic	nothingsometing	then install kubuntu-desktop and use KDE :)
2005-08-02T07:12:00.000Z	thoreauputic	nothingsometing	do "apt-cache search file-browser" perhaps - I use rox here for example
2005-08-02T07:12:00.000Z	thoreauputic	nothingsometing	ah - you can fix that
2005-08-02T07:13:00.000Z	thoreauputic	nothingsometing	 in prefs -behaviour - "open in browser windows"
2005-08-02T07:14:00.000Z	thoreauputic	nothingsometing	that will give you the traditional view with back arrows etc
2005-08-02T07:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	nothingsometing	there was a holy war about it ;)
2005-08-02T07:16:00.000Z	thoreauputic	nothingsometing	not so much ubuntu - it was a gnome thing
2005-08-02T07:16:00.000Z	thoreauputic	nothingsometing	much angry bandidth was wasted over it ;)
2005-08-02T07:26:00.000Z	thoreauputic	nothingsometing	in hoary extras - I would comment them out after you get the codecs, personally
2005-08-02T07:26:00.000Z	thoreauputic	nothingsometing	wise move :)
2005-08-02T07:28:00.000Z	thoreauputic	nothingsometing	try totem-xine
2005-08-02T07:28:00.000Z	thoreauputic	nothingsometing	the xine backend for totem works better atm
2005-08-02T07:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic	nothingsometing	don't be alarmed if it wants to uninstall ubuntu-desktop - that's just a metapackage
2005-08-02T07:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic	nothingsometing	totem is just the pretty face - -xine is the engine :)
2005-08-03T10:54:00.000Z	thoreauputic	nothingsometing	1) help to understand the file 2) disables stuff you don't want
2005-08-03T10:54:00.000Z	thoreauputic	nothingsometing	in some files that is a comment too
2005-08-04T07:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic	nothingsometing	if you don't know, you don't need it :)
2005-08-04T07:26:00.000Z	thoreauputic	nothingsometing	 apt-cache show pure-ftpd
