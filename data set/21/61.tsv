2012-11-24T21:18:00.000Z	SunMoonStar		I tried to do 'ssh localhost' and got 'ssh: connect to host localhost port 22: Connection refused'.. what might be the reason?
2012-11-24T21:18:00.000Z	llutz	SunMoonStar	no sshd running, iptables filtering?
2012-11-24T21:18:00.000Z	llutz	SunMoonStar	sudo lsof -i :22
2012-11-24T21:18:00.000Z	SunMoonStar	llutz	what does that do?
2012-11-24T21:19:00.000Z	llutz	SunMoonStar	man lsof (shows something listening on port 22 or not)
2012-11-24T21:19:00.000Z	llutz	SunMoonStar	no sshd running on that port then
2012-11-24T21:19:00.000Z	llutz	SunMoonStar	sudo apt-get install openssh-server
2012-11-24T21:20:00.000Z	SunMoonStar	llutz	is it unsafe? I'm just trying to learn ssh
2012-11-24T21:20:00.000Z	llutz	SunMoonStar	ssh is pretty safe if you know how to use it
2012-11-24T21:21:00.000Z	SunMoonStar	llutz	thanks
2012-11-24T21:22:00.000Z	SunMoonStar	llutz	now lsof -i :22 gives me a couple sshd entries with (LISTEN) at the end
2012-11-24T21:22:00.000Z	llutz	SunMoonStar	ssh localhost     try again
2012-11-24T21:23:00.000Z	SunMoonStar	llutz	i think it worked, thank you
2012-11-30T03:58:00.000Z	llutz	SunMoonStar	only use option" remove_hiberfile" if you don't want to boot windows from that drive again, it might get corrupted as it was not shutdown cleanly before
2012-11-30T03:59:00.000Z	SunMoonStar	llutz	too late.. I did this: http://pastebin.com/qTiwDDrc and I am in the drive. I won't be able to access it again?
2012-11-30T04:01:00.000Z	llutz	SunMoonStar	windows might have issues if you boot it from this drive, maybe it just works, hard to say. windows was suspended and now all saved info is gone
2012-11-30T04:02:00.000Z	SunMoonStar	llutz	i guess session info doesn't matter that netbook is long gone.. i will be able to mount it on linux later, though, right?
2012-11-30T04:02:00.000Z	llutz	SunMoonStar	should be no problem then
2012-11-30T04:02:00.000Z	SunMoonStar	llutz	thanks
2012-11-30T04:03:00.000Z	SunMoonStar	llutz	I have the window open of the drive but it periodically closes the window and reopens it..
2012-11-30T04:03:00.000Z	SunMoonStar	llutz	how do i stop it from doing that? it does it every 10 seconds
