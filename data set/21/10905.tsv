2005-12-06T16:37:00.000Z	boo		:P
2005-12-06T16:37:00.000Z	topyli	boo	no. there's rar, and the package manager works through it
2005-12-06T16:38:00.000Z	topyli	boo	specifically, you probably want unrar-nonfree from multiverse
2005-12-06T16:38:00.000Z	topyli	boo	it's a ubuntu repository for evil non-free stuff
2005-12-06T16:38:00.000Z	topyli	boo	no. it's just non-free, as in proprietary, not open source
2005-12-06T16:41:00.000Z	topyli	boo	you could get by with the free version, but some new rar archives may be packaged in an extra-evil new format
2005-12-06T16:42:00.000Z	topyli	boo	you can just click away
2005-12-06T16:42:00.000Z	topyli	boo	the gnome arcive manager will find unrar and use it
2005-12-06T16:43:00.000Z	topyli	boo	you *will* learn the command line sooner or later once you find out how powerful the unix shell is
2005-12-06T16:47:00.000Z	topyli	boo	you went straight for non-free! to the stakes, brothers!
2005-12-06T16:51:00.000Z	topyli	boo	the name of the file
2005-12-06T17:13:00.000Z	topyli	boo	dunno, but your all-caps text is half off my sight
