2009-02-15T21:33:00.000Z	BulBulRed		i am having issues with my dual boot. I added a new hard disk whish works fine. Ubuntu loads up find as well but VISTA has a problem: "BOOTMGR.EXE is missing"... Info -> http://paste.ubuntu.com/118500/
2009-02-15T21:34:00.000Z	BulBulRed		any help?
2009-02-15T21:35:00.000Z	dmphotography	BulBulRed	How did you add the extra HD?
2009-02-15T21:36:00.000Z	BulBulRed	dmphotography	i added the hard disk in the pc: popped a sata cable in and power cable
2009-02-15T21:36:00.000Z	BulBulRed		and started the pc
2009-02-15T21:36:00.000Z	dmphotography		Ok, as a spare HardDrive?
2009-02-15T21:36:00.000Z	BulBulRed		no i formatted it as fat
2009-02-15T21:36:00.000Z	BulBulRed		it is used as a storage disk
2009-02-15T21:37:00.000Z	dmphotography	BulBulRed	Go into your BIOS settings and make sure it's not set to boot from that Hard Drive first.
2009-02-15T21:37:00.000Z	dmphotography	BulBulRed	It looks like it's scanning the new hard drive first for the boot manager.
2009-02-15T21:38:00.000Z	BulBulRed	dmphotography	does that matter? grub should know which drive holds windows? (maybe i am wrong√†
2009-02-15T21:38:00.000Z	BulBulRed		i will check it at once
2009-02-15T21:38:00.000Z	dmphotography	BulBulRed	Well, Grub is more for Linux than Windows.
2009-02-15T21:38:00.000Z	BulBulRed		i also noticed that BOOT folder and BOOTMGR was on my "data2" disk
2009-02-15T21:39:00.000Z	dmphotography	BulBulRed	If that fails, fix the boot with your Vista Installation disk.
2009-02-15T21:39:00.000Z	BulBulRed		i read on UbuntuForums that it should be cut and pasted onto the Vista partition
2009-02-15T21:39:00.000Z	BulBulRed		is this an optin to try out?
2009-02-15T21:39:00.000Z	BulBulRed		fix it how? "restore windows installation" ?
2009-02-15T21:40:00.000Z	dmphotography	BulBulRed	I'm not sure about copying the boot manager.  No, you have the option to repair windows, but this will also mess up the GRUB Boot Manager, which you will need to use your LiveCD to restore it after you get Windows working again.
2009-02-15T21:41:00.000Z	dmphotography	BulBulRed	I personally recommend formattting the new drive to a Linux format, such as ext3.
2009-02-15T21:41:00.000Z	dmphotography	BulBulRed	That way Windows ignores it.
