2007-08-31T15:18:00.000Z	kronos		hello
2007-08-31T15:18:00.000Z	kronos		i need some help with a messed up thing ...
2007-08-31T15:18:00.000Z	kronos		i mean, i messed it up :-D
2007-08-31T15:20:00.000Z	kronos		uhm... you know that by default you are not asked for a root password when you install ubuntu ... and the only thing that helps you a lot in this case is /etc/sudoers...
2007-08-31T15:20:00.000Z	kronos		well... I messed it up :|
2007-08-31T15:20:00.000Z	kronos		and I cannot get root access on my own machine now :-|
2007-08-31T15:20:00.000Z	kronos		can anyone help ?
2007-08-31T15:21:00.000Z	kronos		sudo: parse error in /etc/sudoers near line 18
2007-08-31T15:23:00.000Z	DOH	kronos	then your sudoers file has an error at line 18
2007-08-31T15:32:00.000Z	DOH	kronos	does "su" work ?
2007-08-31T15:33:00.000Z	kronos	DOH	yes
2007-08-31T15:33:00.000Z	kronos	DOH	didn't set the password for root , that's the thing
2007-08-31T15:34:00.000Z	DOH	kronos	then edit the file from the live cd :) like wonton said
2007-08-31T15:35:00.000Z	kronos	DOH	yeah I know... but how can I do this remotely ? :D
2007-08-31T15:35:00.000Z	DOH	kronos	but then the answer is wrong -- su does not work in your case
2007-08-31T15:36:00.000Z	DOH	kronos	you are not physically on this machine ? and only access as user and no sudo
2007-08-31T15:36:00.000Z	DOH	kronos	thats a bad start :)
2007-08-31T15:38:00.000Z	kronos	DOH	I know ... I don't have physical access at this moment, maybe tommorow when I get home, and now remotely ... I cannot get root access ... and I cannot wait `till tommorow to do this :-| Are you aware of any other way on how could I fix this ?
2007-08-31T15:40:00.000Z	DOH	kronos	are you with ssh on your remote machine ?
2007-08-31T15:40:00.000Z	kronos	DOH	yes
2007-08-31T15:42:00.000Z	kronos	DOH	ok, I guess I give up :| thanks for the help
