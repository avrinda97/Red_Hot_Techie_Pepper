2009-08-07T01:53:00.000Z	nodsag		I have integrated graphics on a new install of Jaunty dual booted with XP. Video is very choppy compared to in XP and the visual effects appearance editor won't let me set anything other than None. The vid is integrated, intel I think, but I don't know what I'm supposed to do to get it working
2009-08-07T01:54:00.000Z	heheho0	nodsag	first check, if it's intel
2009-08-07T01:54:00.000Z	heheho0	nodsag	in console: dmesg | grep -i intel
2009-08-07T01:55:00.000Z	nodsag	heheho0	It says Intel 830M Chipset
2009-08-07T01:57:00.000Z	heheho0	nodsag	sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-intel
2009-08-07T01:57:00.000Z	heheho0	nodsag	try this first
2009-08-07T01:58:00.000Z	nodsag	heheho0	it says it's ready the newest version
2009-08-07T01:58:00.000Z	heheho0	nodsag	yep, also google for UXA and EXA in xorg.conf
2009-08-07T01:58:00.000Z	heheho0	nodsag	also -- I'm having intel at laptop (x3100)
2009-08-07T01:58:00.000Z	heheho0	nodsag	driver is really crappy :-(
2009-08-07T01:59:00.000Z	heheho0	nodsag	some try to install custom stuff from ppas
2009-08-07T02:04:00.000Z	heheho0	nodsag	be prepared -- as I said intel video is a nightmare now at linux :-(
2009-08-07T02:05:00.000Z	nodsag	heheho0	i made a backup of xorg... if i can only use some kind of command line after i try this, will there be a simple command to restore it?
2009-08-07T02:06:00.000Z	heheho0	nodsag	xorg.conf? it's simple -- just save -- mv -v /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.old, then, after restoring do vice versa
2009-08-07T02:12:00.000Z	nodsag	heheho0	didn't work, and xorg is restored...
2009-08-07T02:13:00.000Z	heheho0	nodsag	you played with exa?
2009-08-07T02:14:00.000Z	nodsag	heheho0	I'm not sure, i don't know about this stuff... i just added Option AccelMethod “UXA”  under the device section
2009-08-07T02:16:00.000Z	heheho0	nodsag	sounds like that...
2009-08-07T02:17:00.000Z	heheho0	nodsag	and what are your symptoms? your affects are slow?
2009-08-07T02:18:00.000Z	nodsag	heheho0	some parsing error or something i think
2009-08-07T02:19:00.000Z	heheho0	nodsag	this EXA and UXA modes are pain in ass :) you should carefully google for them, search from which versions of *kernel* and *intel-drivers* some modes are supported and some not
