2009-02-14T22:12:00.000Z	boaty		I am trying to get my Logitech Quickcam express to work in skype or camorama. I have read the ubuntu webcam page which says it should be automatic. When I do lsusb it recognises it. I also tested it in skype and that freezes the whole computer. I have seen the thread with the LD preload and tried it. Still no luck. Any other suggestions? Thank you

2009-02-14T22:13:00.000Z	boaty		It works it windoze.
2009-02-14T22:13:00.000Z	sammyF	boaty	oh... and I'm assuming you're using either 8.04 or 8.10 here
2009-02-14T22:14:00.000Z	boaty		8.10
2009-02-14T22:14:00.000Z	sammyF	boaty	very weird
2009-02-14T22:14:00.000Z	sammyF	boaty	only video input you have? maybe you're using a different device than the quickcam
2009-02-14T22:15:00.000Z	boaty		I have the pc setup to my tv using a monitor cable. But that is output not input.
2009-02-14T22:15:00.000Z	sammyF	boaty	indeed
2009-02-14T22:15:00.000Z	sammyF	boaty	what did you setup in the multimedia panel for video input?
2009-02-14T22:16:00.000Z	boaty		only thought is that it is perhaps just too old
2009-02-14T22:17:00.000Z	sammyF	boaty	please write the name of the person you're talking to. it's getting rather messy to answer otherwise ;)
2009-02-14T22:17:00.000Z	sammyF	boaty	when you go to system->Preferences->Multimedia System Selector in the second tab, what's in video input?
2009-02-14T22:18:00.000Z	boaty		samyF. ok thank you for that guidance
2009-02-14T22:19:00.000Z	sammyF	boaty	oh ... And most irc clients have name completion with TAB :)
2009-02-14T22:19:00.000Z	boaty	sammyF	I have done System>Preferences and do not see mulitmedia selector
2009-02-14T22:20:00.000Z	sammyF	boaty	"Multimedia System Selector" actually. YOu're using an english version of ubuntu or another language?
2009-02-14T22:21:00.000Z	boaty		SAMMYF: using English version. Nothing that vagues looks like that
2009-02-14T22:21:00.000Z	sammyF	boaty	oops ... THAT is weird
2009-02-14T22:25:00.000Z	sammyF	boaty	you probably missed it, but I sent you a private message :)
2009-02-14T22:26:00.000Z	sammyF	boaty	can you pastebin what you have in your system>preferences menu, okease?
