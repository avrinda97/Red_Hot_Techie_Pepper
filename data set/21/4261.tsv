2008-08-02T04:53:00.000Z	glitsj16	moolcool	have you tried playing with VLC's audio output module settings yet (like change it from default to ALSA or OSS) ? don't know about Amarok but i guess it has something similar you could try
2008-08-02T04:54:00.000Z	glitsj16	moolcool	settings, audio output modules
2008-08-02T04:54:00.000Z	glitsj16	moolcool	settings > preferences > audio output modules that is
2008-08-02T04:56:00.000Z	glitsj16	moolcool	odd, did you hide your menu bar on VLC or something similar?
2008-08-02T04:56:00.000Z	glitsj16	moolcool	ah, i think there's a box you might need to tick to see those first, advanced options i believe
2008-08-02T04:57:00.000Z	glitsj16	moolcool	look for the advanced options box, bottom right
2008-08-02T04:58:00.000Z	glitsj16	moolcool	:) np
2008-08-02T04:58:00.000Z	glitsj16	moolcool	try changing the audio output module, there are only a couple, and test if any of those produces sound output
2008-08-02T05:04:00.000Z	glitsj16	moolcool	okay .. do you use pulseaudio ? if so i believe VLC needs the vlc-plugin-pulse
2008-08-02T05:06:00.000Z	glitsj16	moolcool	the default audio proxy system used on ubuntu 8.04
2008-08-02T05:07:00.000Z	glitsj16	moolcool	easily checked .. open pavucontrol (if you have that installed) and play something in an app that works, it would show up in there so you'd be sure it's active
2008-08-02T05:08:00.000Z	glitsj16	moolcool	yes
2008-08-02T05:10:00.000Z	glitsj16	moolcool	while you're at it, "sudo apt-get install vlc-plugin-pulse" (a plugin for VLC to get native audio support when using pulseaudio), if you don't want it you can always remove it later, just to check if that gets VLC working properly
2008-08-02T05:14:00.000Z	glitsj16	moolcool	well that's a start, means you use pulseaudio .. VLC might need a resetting to ALSA if you changed those settings earlier
2008-08-02T05:15:00.000Z	glitsj16	moolcool	leaving VLC out of the loop for a sec, can you get Amarok to work by setting that to gstreamer ?
2008-08-02T05:16:00.000Z	glitsj16	moolcool	nice .. that leaves amarok and you can blast away heh
2008-08-02T05:17:00.000Z	glitsj16	moolcool	nope, but http://www.pulseaudio.org/wiki/PerfectSetup has loads of info on specific applications
2008-08-02T05:17:00.000Z	glitsj16	moolcool	welcome, enjoy
