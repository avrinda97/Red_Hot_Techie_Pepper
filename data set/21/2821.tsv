2009-06-08T02:02:00.000Z	robin87		hello ppl...i having trouble doing something really simple...i am trying to run a ventrilo server executable on ubuntu server and it keeps telling me that there file doesn't exist :S...i have used ./appname; appname; exec appname; exec ./appname, nothing works..?
2009-06-08T02:03:00.000Z	fryguy	robin87	chmod +x the file?
2009-06-08T02:03:00.000Z	robin87	fryguy	i did chmod 755 but with try +x
2009-06-08T02:05:00.000Z	robin87	fryguy	nope same crap, i dont get a confirmation on the chmod change though
2009-06-08T02:05:00.000Z	fryguy	robin87	ls -l .
2009-06-08T02:06:00.000Z	robin87	fryguy	nablaa: yep it has the flags :S what am i doing wrong
2009-06-08T02:06:00.000Z	fryguy	robin87	pastebin
2009-06-08T02:06:00.000Z	robin87	fryguy	nablaa: the tutorial says i just need to navigate to dir and do ./ventrilo_srv
2009-06-08T02:07:00.000Z	fryguy	robin87	spectacular, no ls -l . and pastebin
2009-06-08T02:08:00.000Z	robin87	fryguy	haha...i cant use pastebin because it is ubuntu-server running in vmware, no gui
2009-06-08T02:08:00.000Z	fryguy	robin87	there is pastebin cli apps
2009-06-08T02:12:00.000Z	robin87	fryguy	i install pastebinit with apt-get, when i try and run it appears to hang
2009-06-08T02:13:00.000Z	fryguy	robin87	it reads from stdin, read the manpage
2009-06-08T02:17:00.000Z	robin87	fryguy	i have no idea how this pastebinit app works, can u link me to the page, i cant find it
2009-06-08T02:17:00.000Z	fryguy	robin87	just pipe data from stdout to it
2009-06-08T02:17:00.000Z	robin87	fryguy	what is stdout?
2009-06-08T02:17:00.000Z	fryguy	robin87	also, like i said, read it's manpage
2009-06-08T02:18:00.000Z	fryguy	robin87	stdout is file descriptor 1 on a unix based system, and corresponds to the output of the tty you are currently connected to
2009-06-08T02:18:00.000Z	robin87	fryguy	what is a manpage :O
2009-06-08T02:18:00.000Z	fryguy	robin87	maybe you should consider reading up on some basics of the unix command line interface?
2009-06-08T02:19:00.000Z	robin87	fryguy	i should yeah
