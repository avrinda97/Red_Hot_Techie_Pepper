2011-08-18T07:15:00.000Z	Kamikaze		hey all... I just finished installation of latest version of Ubuntu, the thing is this, My partition "D" and "E" are NTFS is that ok? because I'm coming from Windows Vista and I did't format that partitions, sure i change the format of that partitions that are NTFS ?
2011-08-18T07:16:00.000Z	escott	Kamikaze	you can't/shouldn't install ubuntu to D or E, but otherwise its fine
2011-08-18T07:26:00.000Z	escott	Kamikaze	you generally cannot "just change" partitions. upgrades do exist for ext2->ext3->ext4->btrfs but not for other combinations
2011-08-18T07:27:00.000Z	Kamikaze	escott	thanks )
2011-08-18T07:30:00.000Z	Kamikaze	escott	 might i sound funny but i would like to ask, is that true that Linuxes in this case(Ubuntu) never get infected with viruses ?
2011-08-18T07:30:00.000Z	escott	Kamikaze	generally speaking no. for a number of reasons
2011-08-18T07:31:00.000Z	Kamikaze	escott	so there is possibility that even Ubuntu can be infected with some viruses ?
2011-08-18T07:31:00.000Z	escott	Kamikaze	its not something one usually worries about but yes it is possible.
2011-08-18T07:32:00.000Z	Kamikaze	escott	thanks:) i hope it wont happen with me )
2011-08-18T07:33:00.000Z	escott	Kamikaze	in common terminology "viruses" there are lots of terms depending on how it is transmitted and what it does
2011-08-18T20:22:00.000Z	escott	Kamikaze	obsessed with swap... during the install there isn't anywhere to swap to (usually) so it might be 0
2011-08-18T20:23:00.000Z	Kamikaze	escott	thanks
2011-08-18T20:26:00.000Z	Kamikaze	escott	and my last question, my player Banshee sometimes gets stuck, its just freeze, is that mean im doing something wrong or its common thing?
2011-08-18T20:26:00.000Z	escott	Kamikaze	no idea, ask the channel

2011-08-18T22:22:00.000Z	Kamikaze	escott	sorry for bothering recently i have download "Me TV" program but disliked it, i uninstalled it, but icon left in my "Media Apps" as i click on it, it makes no action and no reaction because it has been removed, so how can i remove the icon from "Media Apps"
2011-08-18T22:24:00.000Z	escott	Kamikaze	if apt installed the .desktop file then be sure to purge the application. if not you could remove it manually. if you added it with alacarte remove it there
