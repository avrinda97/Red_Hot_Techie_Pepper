2006-12-20T15:16:00.000Z	rapid	randy	you just copy the .so file to the /plugin directory of firefox
2006-12-20T15:17:00.000Z	rapid	randy	might be /usr/bin/firefox/plugins
2006-12-20T15:18:00.000Z	rapid	randy	do a locate firefox find where its at , then copy the file to the plugin dir.
2006-12-20T15:18:00.000Z	rapid	randy	open a terminal, and type locate firefox
2006-12-20T15:20:00.000Z	rapid	randy	have you extracted the flashplayer archive?
2006-12-20T15:20:00.000Z	rapid	randy	copy libflashplayer.so to your firefox/plugins directory
2006-12-20T15:21:00.000Z	rapid	randy	you've extracted it?
2006-12-20T15:21:00.000Z	rapid	randy	/usr/bin/firefox/plugins/
2006-12-20T15:22:00.000Z	rapid	randy	if that doesn't work, use Finnj's suggestion "sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree"
2006-12-20T15:23:00.000Z	rapid	randy	in a terminal try typing "sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree"
2006-12-20T15:24:00.000Z	rapid	randy	did you run that command?
