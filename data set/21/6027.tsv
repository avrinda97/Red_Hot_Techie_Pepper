2007-06-17T06:21:00.000Z	Skiessi	TurtleBoots	you must choose the beryl to be your windower
2007-06-17T06:22:00.000Z	TurtleBoots		skiessi - where do I choose that from - beryl-manager?
2007-06-17T06:24:00.000Z	TurtleBoots	shiester_miester	- ok have set the window manager - but can't get nice 3d cube affect
2007-06-17T06:25:00.000Z	TurtleBoots	shiester_miester	- hmmm here's something. it keeps defaulting to Metacity under window manager. it doesn't stay as beryl. Why might that be?
2007-06-17T06:25:00.000Z	Skiessi	TurtleBoots	have you installed emerald or heliodor?
2007-06-17T06:26:00.000Z	TurtleBoots	shiester_miester	- rendering platform = automatic. Is this what u mean?
2007-06-17T06:26:00.000Z	TurtleBoots		skiessi - emerald
2007-06-17T06:27:00.000Z	TurtleBoots	shiester_miester	- should it be automatic or nvidia (graphics card I have)?
2007-06-17T06:27:00.000Z	Skiessi		and glxgears is running smoothly?
2007-06-17T06:27:00.000Z	Skiessi		maybe
2007-06-17T06:27:00.000Z	TurtleBoots		skiessi - glxgears gives error = Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".
2007-06-17T06:27:00.000Z	TurtleBoots		Error: couldn't get an RGB, Double-buffered visual
2007-06-17T06:29:00.000Z	Skiessi	TurtleBoots	was beryl running when you tested with glxgears?
2007-06-17T06:30:00.000Z	TurtleBoots		skiessi - yeah it's present in the system tray
2007-06-17T06:30:00.000Z	Skiessi	TurtleBoots	not beryl-manager
2007-06-17T06:30:00.000Z	TurtleBoots		skiessi - sorry :-/
2007-06-17T06:31:00.000Z	Skiessi	TurtleBoots	disable Beryl while you use glxgears
2007-06-17T06:31:00.000Z	TurtleBoots	shiester_miester	- I take it I'll have to get glxgears running first though?
2007-06-17T06:31:00.000Z	Skiessi	TurtleBoots	umm yeah that's a good idea
2007-06-17T06:32:00.000Z	TurtleBoots	shiester_miester	- how do I connect to beryl channel? (I'm pretty much a newbie)
2007-06-17T06:32:00.000Z	Skiessi	TurtleBoots	the #beryl -channel
