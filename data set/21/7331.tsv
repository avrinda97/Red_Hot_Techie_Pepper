2006-10-21T05:32:00.000Z	gnomefreak	ptl	can you give me the link that says to add backports
2006-10-21T05:32:00.000Z	ptl	gnomefreak	yes, http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=31061&highlight=mplayer --> "Playing DVDs
2006-10-21T05:33:00.000Z	gnomefreak	ptl	ty
2006-10-21T05:33:00.000Z	gnomefreak	ptl	that is weird but i will find out if its been added to backports
2006-10-21T05:35:00.000Z	gnomefreak	ptl	i dont see that part but mplayer is in multiverse
2006-10-21T05:35:00.000Z	gnomefreak	ptl	ah it sasy ubuntuforums-backports
2006-10-21T05:36:00.000Z	gnomefreak	ptl	its a 3rd party repo and in my opinion should not be used
2006-10-21T05:36:00.000Z	ptl	gnomefreak	I can't find mplayer on multiverse. I issued an apt-cache policy and I have just noticed that there's only one candidate for mplayer, without the "ubuntu" suffix.
2006-10-21T05:36:00.000Z	gnomefreak	ptl	its in multiverse
2006-10-21T05:37:00.000Z	gnomefreak	ptl	the repos that end in universe add a space than add multiverse to them
2006-10-21T05:37:00.000Z	gnomefreak	ptl	im not talking the one that says dapper-backports
2006-10-21T05:37:00.000Z	ptl	gnomefreak	ok
2006-10-21T05:42:00.000Z	ptl	gnomefreak	can you do a 'apt-cache policy mplayer' there and tell me where does your mplayer comes from?
2006-10-21T05:44:00.000Z	gnomefreak	ptl	add that repo to your list
2006-10-21T05:44:00.000Z	gnomefreak	ptl	also add the following
2006-10-21T05:45:00.000Z	ptl	gnomefreak	ok... I'll try. I was using 'br' and such.
2006-10-21T05:45:00.000Z	gnomefreak	ptl	you have those repos already
2006-10-21T05:45:00.000Z	gnomefreak	ptl	they just dont have multiverse added to the end
2006-10-21T05:46:00.000Z	ptl	gnomefreak	ok
2006-10-21T05:48:00.000Z	ptl	gnomefreak	thanks! That solved the problem. It seems that the 'br' (Brazil) mirrors were somehow lacking. I've just noticed that there were error messages about Packages.gz not found there.
