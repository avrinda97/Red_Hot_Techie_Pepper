2011-01-06T07:30:00.000Z	israfil		hello, i use Kubuntu Hardy Heron and my Laptop display on which i installed the nvidia driver stays dark. Can you help me?
2011-01-06T07:30:00.000Z	israfil		cat /proc/acpi/video/NVID/LCD/brightness says: "levels:  80 13 7 13 20 30 45 60 80 100"  and  "current: 0"
2011-01-06T07:30:00.000Z	israfil		but i edited the brightness file and i wrote the value "100" in it, but nothing happens
2011-01-06T07:31:00.000Z	israfil		i did "sudo /etc/init.d/laptop-mode start" and "sudo /etc/init.d/acpid restart" after it

2011-01-06T07:32:00.000Z	dr4c4n	israfil	have you tried from nvidia-settings?
2011-01-06T07:34:00.000Z	israfil	dr4c4n	yes, it wors, but i don't know if i can edit it with nvidia-settings so that it looks normally
2011-01-06T07:35:00.000Z	dr4c4n	israfil	options should be in there to fix it up, u on lappy or desktop?
2011-01-06T07:35:00.000Z	dr4c4n	israfil	i'm on a laptop w/ nvidia screen and usually do all my settings through nvidia settings and the on board brightness controls :)
2011-01-06T07:37:00.000Z	israfil	dr4c4n	i have got a laptop (samsung)
2011-01-06T07:37:00.000Z	dr4c4n	israfil	have you tryed using on keyboard functions for brightness?
2011-01-06T07:41:00.000Z	israfil	dr4c4n	i tried it with laptop-mode-tools and it worked a few times. But now it does NOT
2011-01-06T07:41:00.000Z	israfil	dr4c4n	the keyboard functions do not work with linux
2011-01-06T07:42:00.000Z	dr4c4n	israfil	well i'm running a lenovo, and they do on mine
2011-01-06T07:42:00.000Z	dr4c4n	israfil	did you check ur specific laptop model
2011-01-06T07:43:00.000Z	israfil	dr4c4n	what should i check?
2011-01-06T07:45:00.000Z	dr4c4n	israfil	well first I would check to see if there are specific drivers for those keys on ur keyboard, search something like keyboard drivers Samsung model # or a specific setup like for gentoo for instance for your model number of laptop, just to see what drivers they use, there might be something there, other than that I'd totally save up your xconf, and try to change some of the values in nvidia-settings :) good luck
2011-01-06T07:46:00.000Z	israfil		ok, thanks dr4c4n
2011-01-06T07:46:00.000Z	dr4c4n	israfil	don't thank me yet, till stuff gets workin ;)
