2007-05-28T15:09:00.000Z	gregubu		flannel: how do i determine that?
2007-05-28T15:09:00.000Z	Flannel	gregubu	sudo apt-get install php5-cli, if it's notinstalled, it will be.
2007-05-28T15:09:00.000Z	gregubu	Flannel	what does the cli variant do?
2007-05-28T15:09:00.000Z	gregubu	Flannel	command line interface?
2007-05-28T15:10:00.000Z	Flannel	gregubu	sure, or with synaptic, find "php5-cli" and if there isn't a green square, mark it for installation, and then apply
2007-05-28T15:10:00.000Z	gregubu	Flannel	it says package php-cli is not avail, but is referred to by another package
2007-05-28T15:11:00.000Z	gregubu	Flannel	do i need to update my respositories perhaps?

2007-05-28T15:12:00.000Z	gregubu	Flannel	after it's installed, how will i be able to determine the exec. path?
