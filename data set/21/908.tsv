2011-04-22T15:21:00.000Z	S1las		i can't turn on or off my touchpad
2011-04-22T15:21:00.000Z	S1las		i try to install fnfxd

2011-04-22T15:21:00.000Z	Ben64		there should be a hardware switch for wifi, and most or all of the function keys on laptops won't work
2011-04-22T15:22:00.000Z	S1las		there is no hardware switch for wifi
2011-04-22T15:23:00.000Z	S1las		So?
2011-04-22T15:24:00.000Z	S1las		i can't turn my touchpad on ?
2011-04-22T15:24:00.000Z	Ben64		it should already be on, you probably can't turn it off
2011-04-22T15:24:00.000Z	S1las		ghaha
2011-04-22T15:25:00.000Z	S1las	Ben64	what you wan't to say? that i`m stupid or something
2011-04-22T15:25:00.000Z	Ben64		no? i didn't say anything like that
2011-04-22T15:26:00.000Z	S1las		so
2011-04-22T15:26:00.000Z	S1las		what is the solution
2011-04-22T15:26:00.000Z	S1las		i read about fnfxd
2011-04-22T15:26:00.000Z	S1las		but i can't get it running
2011-04-22T15:27:00.000Z	Ben64	S1las	i'm trying to say that you likely cannot use the function keys in ubuntu, but they aren't really necessary
2011-04-22T15:28:00.000Z	S1las	Ben64	okey but then
