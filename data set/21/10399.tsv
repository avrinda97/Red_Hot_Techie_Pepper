2005-03-18T15:40:00.000Z	eyequeue	blizah	 you may be interested in the backports project, see the wiki
2005-03-20T11:29:00.000Z	eyequeue	blizah	 man update-rc.d
2005-03-20T11:35:00.000Z	eyequeue	blizah	 read that man page
2005-03-20T11:35:00.000Z	eyequeue	blizah	 man update-rc.d
2005-03-20T11:36:00.000Z	blizah	eyequeue	whats that do
2005-03-20T11:36:00.000Z	eyequeue	blizah	 it educates you how
2005-03-20T11:43:00.000Z	blizah	eyequeue	it seems like this command is more for before you login..doesnt control the programs that run after you have logged tell...tell me if im wrong
2005-03-20T11:44:00.000Z	eyequeue	blizah	 maybe a re-read, now that you've read it once, will be clearer :)  anyway, you write a file, then run that command ... that creates the links to make what you want happen at boot.  completely unrelated to whether someone logs in at all.  that what you want?
2005-03-20T11:46:00.000Z	blizah	eyequeue	so it does deal with if xchat, or gimp, or firefox opens up after you have loged on  (rereading :D
2005-03-20T11:47:00.000Z	eyequeue	blizah	 okay, it appears you're looking for something completely different.  let me explain the two concepts
2005-03-20T11:48:00.000Z	blizah	eyequeue	ah ok i was right its only for the proccess you computer goes through AT boot...not the programs that start up when youve logged on
2005-03-20T11:48:00.000Z	eyequeue	blizah	 rc.d --- things that run on boot, like say firewall protection, or a webserver daemon
2005-03-20T11:48:00.000Z	blizah	eyequeue	yea thats why i posted that msg above   "<blizah> eyequeue it seems like this command is more for before you login..doesnt control the programs that run after you have logged tell...tell me if im wrong"
2005-03-20T11:49:00.000Z	eyequeue	blizah	 what you appear to be looking for is "what happens when my user logs in" which can be changed by editing "~/.bash_profile" for example, if you want to do it on a per-user basis
2005-03-20T11:49:00.000Z	eyequeue	blizah	 i thought you wanted on-boot :)
2005-03-20T12:10:00.000Z	blizah	eyequeue	another way to change it is computer->desktop preferences->session
2005-03-20T12:10:00.000Z	eyequeue	blizah	 that may perhaps only be for gui sessions
2005-03-24T06:22:00.000Z	eyequeue	blizah	 in "command:" preface it with "gksudo "
2005-03-24T06:22:00.000Z	eyequeue	blizah	 "gksudo foo bar"
