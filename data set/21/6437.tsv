2007-04-04T16:14:00.000Z	cellojoe		whenever i try to enable Beryl, the windows go away, then come back and metacity is enabled (as the fallback)
2007-04-04T16:14:00.000Z	cellojoe		well no
2007-04-04T16:14:00.000Z	cellojoe		i was trying to
2007-04-04T16:14:00.000Z	Spliffster	cellojoe	have you checked the logs in /var/log/* '
2007-04-04T16:16:00.000Z	cellojoe	Spliffster	any idea which log to check?
2007-04-04T16:17:00.000Z	Spliffster	cellojoe	i'd check messages, daemon and the Xorg log (the xorg log may be in /etc/X11)
2007-04-04T16:17:00.000Z	Spliffster	cellojoe	but first, i'd check if there is a special log for beryl (google for it ...)
2007-04-04T16:59:00.000Z	Spliffster	cellojoe	NTFS write is already included in the edgy, use ntfs-3g
2007-04-04T05:00:00.000Z	cellojoe	Spliffster	yup, i did. thanks.... i think inoex is having the problem
2007-04-04T05:33:00.000Z	Spliffster	cellojoe	hmmm ... i lost how fon'ts work... there were some huge changes since 1997 .. but you might google for that nice fonts mini howto :)
2007-04-04T05:39:00.000Z	Spliffster	cellojoe	the problem is, if you have wine installed it will actually come up on your ubuntu box (regedit that is)
2007-04-04T05:41:00.000Z	Spliffster	cellojoe	home sweet home ... you are not even missing the transparency and ease of use a tool like regedit gives us all on your linux box. now that's sweet, isn't it ? :D
2007-04-04T05:42:00.000Z	Spliffster	cellojoe	i mean the very transparent access to important data ... :d
2007-04-04T05:42:00.000Z	Spliffster	cellojoe	ok ... ok ... this was a bit sarcstic
2007-04-04T05:43:00.000Z	Spliffster	cellojoe	yeah well my english isn't that good ... and my spelling even worse ... so ..
2007-04-04T05:46:00.000Z	Spliffster	cellojoe	check this screenshot: http://spliffster.homeip.net/tmp/pfueuescht.png the macosx like launcher isc AWN
2007-04-04T05:48:00.000Z	Spliffster	cellojoe	and it's very usefull. it's like in OSX .. it's a combined window list and launcher. so once a proggy is open the little dart below the icon disapears. and when a window gets an event (chat window for example) the icon starts bumping
2007-04-04T06:14:00.000Z	Spliffster	cellojoe	not sure if i understand you right. if you are looking for a solution to randomly restart windows ... just boot it and wait :-P
2007-04-04T06:14:00.000Z	cellojoe	Spliffster	haha, good answer, but someones windows box is restarting randomly.
2007-04-04T06:15:00.000Z	Spliffster	cellojoe	bad ram, goofy drivers, corrupt registry ... funny services ... there are plenty of possibilities and no usable logs .... good luck troubleshooting
2007-04-04T06:41:00.000Z	Spliffster	cellojoe	:-P
