2011-05-04T17:04:00.000Z	Dazzled1		hmm, I'm under the impression that Natty boots significantly slower then 10.10
2011-05-04T17:04:00.000Z	Dazzled1		also when shutting down, seems to take afes
2011-05-04T17:04:00.000Z	coz_	Dazzled1	 I think it is likely due to hardware differences,,  is this a desktop or laptop?
2011-05-04T17:05:00.000Z	Dazzled1	coz_	laptop, 10.10 was lightning fast
2011-05-04T17:06:00.000Z	coz_	Dazzled1	  not surprising,, even though most of the developers use laptops... 11.04  has exhibited different boot  speeds and glitches on several systems I have installed it on
2011-05-04T17:07:00.000Z	coz_	Dazzled1	  give it about a month,,, most glitches should have been worked out by then,  although  ,, 10.04  was LTS,, and until 12.04,, I would consider every version inbetween,, experimental
2011-05-04T17:07:00.000Z	Dazzled1	coz_	true
2011-05-04T17:29:00.000Z	coz_	Dazzled1	 if you are using 11.04  I can verify  that it has some video issues on dual monitors...
2011-05-04T17:29:00.000Z	Dazzled1	coz_	ah ok, yeah I'm on Natty
2011-05-04T17:29:00.000Z	coz_	Dazzled1	 rather 11.04  Unity
2011-05-04T17:29:00.000Z	Dazzled1	coz_	yeah, I'm still trying to get used to it :)
2011-05-04T17:32:00.000Z	coz_	Dazzled1	 at this point  Unity  on dual monitors ,, especially if you are enabling dual monitors after boot,, has issues,, there is quite a bit of video  garble in that situation,, so I am not surprise it does this while you boot to dual set up
2011-05-04T17:33:00.000Z	coz_	Dazzled1	 I believe  it is related to  nux   which is an open-source java toolkit which was necessary , in part , for helping compiz to work on Unity
2011-05-04T17:33:00.000Z	Dazzled1	coz_	ah, I see
2011-05-04T17:34:00.000Z	coz_	Dazzled1	 nux allows for " and efficient  XML pricessing"  unquote :)
2011-05-04T17:34:00.000Z	coz_	Dazzled1	  rather  "an efficient"
2011-05-04T17:36:00.000Z	coz_	Dazzled1	 I simply switched to classic gnome  ,,, much easier to deal with dual set ups..
2011-05-04T17:37:00.000Z	Dazzled1	coz_	yeah, think I might consider switching back as well
2011-05-04T17:38:00.000Z	coz_	Dazzled1	 well  you dont have to swtich to a previous version...simply log off  and log onto classic :)
2011-05-04T17:38:00.000Z	Dazzled1	coz_	ah, yeah, that's what I meant :p
2011-05-04T17:39:00.000Z	coz_	Dazzled1	 ph phew!  I thought you were going to downgrade :)
