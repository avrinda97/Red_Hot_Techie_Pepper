2010-06-20T16:47:00.000Z	Joshua_Roberts		need some help getting my video card to work properly.  ubuntu 9.10 32bit
2010-06-20T16:47:00.000Z	Joshua_Roberts		please
2010-06-20T16:48:00.000Z	soreau	Joshua_Roberts	What is not working about it?
2010-06-20T16:48:00.000Z	soreau	Joshua_Roberts	nvidia?
2010-06-20T16:49:00.000Z	soreau	Joshua_Roberts	Does it help if you disable desktop effects?
2010-06-20T16:50:00.000Z	soreau	Joshua_Roberts	Can you try booting with radeon.modeset=1 as a kernel parameter to enable KMS?
2010-06-20T16:52:00.000Z	soreau	Joshua_Roberts	You should try entering it at the grub prompt first so it will only be active for that session
2010-06-20T16:52:00.000Z	soreau	Joshua_Roberts	If it helps, then upgrading to 10.04 should help since KMS is now the default for radeon
2010-06-20T16:53:00.000Z	soreau	Joshua_Roberts	Did you have static windows issue?
2010-06-20T16:54:00.000Z	soreau	Joshua_Roberts	Well that was using kms already so try asking in #radeon or filing a bug report. A screenshot might also help clarify the issue
2010-06-20T16:58:00.000Z	Joshua_Roberts	soreau	you thin the KMS is already running then?
2010-06-20T16:58:00.000Z	soreau	Joshua_Roberts	On 9.10, no it is UMS as default
2010-06-20T16:59:00.000Z	soreau	Joshua_Roberts	You have to register your nick name
2010-06-20T17:00:00.000Z	soreau	Joshua_Roberts	If you had the same issue in 10.04, I doubt enbleing modeset will help since KMS is default in 10.04
2010-06-20T17:00:00.000Z	soreau	Joshua_Roberts	I asked you if you had the static window issue in 10.04 and you said yes
2010-06-20T17:02:00.000Z	soreau	Joshua_Roberts	Ok, when grub loads, press esc then highlight ubuntu and press e to edit
2010-06-20T17:02:00.000Z	soreau	Joshua_Roberts	Then, you will want to append the option on the kernel line after ro quiet splash
2010-06-20T17:03:00.000Z	soreau	Joshua_Roberts	so it will look like kernel root=blah blah ro quiet splash radeon.modeset=1
2010-06-20T23:36:00.000Z	soreau	Joshua_Roberts	You mean two x sessions on different tty's or two separate X screens?
2010-06-20T23:38:00.000Z	Joshua_Roberts	soreau	I upgraded to 10.04 and it solved the issues I was having with the video card.  But, now I want to run a separate x-session on each monitor.
2010-06-20T23:46:00.000Z	soreau	Joshua_Roberts	Ah yes, just define two X screens in your xorg.conf which you'll probably want two device and monitor sections as well (for each screen)
