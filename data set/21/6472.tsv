2007-03-28T05:28:00.000Z	mikebeecham		Am I doing it right?
2007-03-28T05:28:00.000Z	Pici	mikebeecham	Its called a highlight.
2007-03-28T05:28:00.000Z	mikebeecham	Pici	How is that done?
2007-03-28T05:29:00.000Z	Pici	mikebeecham	Its configurable in your irc client.

2010-02-23T20:45:00.000Z	Pici	mikebeecham	You need to install the relevant package first.  What kind of VPN are you trying to connect to?
2010-02-23T20:46:00.000Z	mikebeecham	Pici	pptp
2010-02-23T20:48:00.000Z	Pici	mikebeecham	Install the network-manager-pptp package, you may need to restart network-manager service afterwards.
2010-02-23T20:49:00.000Z	mikebeecham	Pici	thanks
2010-02-23T21:05:00.000Z	mikebeecham	Pici	would you be able to help me further on setting a VPN up?  I have created a new connection, entered the server name, username and password, but the connection fails
2010-02-23T21:07:00.000Z	Pici	mikebeecham	I'm sorry, I have very little experience connecting to vpns.  I had a similar problem getting the 'add' button to appear for my employer's cisco vpn, so I knew there was an additional package that needed to be installed.
2010-02-23T21:08:00.000Z	mikebeecham	Pici	thanks anyway!
2010-05-10T23:20:00.000Z	Pici	mikebeecham	Why would you need to do that?
2010-05-10T23:20:00.000Z	mikebeecham	Pici	long story, but I tried out Kubuntu, which has now left all my mouse themes looking like they stepped out of the 70s
2010-05-10T23:21:00.000Z	Pici	mikebeecham	And changing your mouse theme in gnome now causes nothing to happen?
2010-05-10T23:23:00.000Z	Pici	mikebeecham	Take a look at this and see if it fits your problem, if so, there is a workaround in there (not the recompiling one, another one about copying your themes somewhere): https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/459647
2010-05-10T23:23:00.000Z	mikebeecham	Pici	will look now!
2010-05-10T23:42:00.000Z	mikebeecham	Pici	thats the issue mate
2010-05-10T23:42:00.000Z	Pici	mikebeecham	Yep.  did any of those workaround help?
