2008-12-13T03:44:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Pici	that's a little confusing tho.. because dpkg say -9 at the end.. -9 indicate a version of the packaging.. not the kernel version
2008-12-13T03:44:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Pici	and there is no 2.6.27.9 kernel that i am aware of
2008-12-13T03:45:00.000Z	Pici	onetinsoldier	Sorry, yes, past the 27 the rest of the versions are from the packaging and patch process by the kernel team
2008-12-13T03:45:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Pici	ok, just wanted to be sure.. thank you :-)
2008-12-17T01:23:00.000Z	Pici	onetinsoldier	that includes directories
2008-12-17T01:23:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Pici	yeah, you're right
2008-12-22T22:27:00.000Z	Pici	onetinsoldier	Thats the same thing that you should get from apt-get build-dep pidgin (or whatever source you're trying to install)
2008-12-26T20:14:00.000Z	Pici	onetinsoldier	That may interrupt other owner related permissions. chmod g-r is a safer way to go.
2008-12-26T20:15:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Pici	grobda24 seemed to want pretty tight permission on it
2008-12-26T20:17:00.000Z	Pici	onetinsoldier	But if a file is chmodded already to 7xx chmoding to 6xx will break the executable bit for owners, and vice versa.  'o-r'  (not g-r, I mistyped) will remove read permissions from everyone else, which is what he wants.
2008-12-26T20:19:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Pici	perhaps, but this is what grobda24 asked for  --->  how can I hide everything in that directory from non root users ??
2008-12-26T20:19:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Pici	ok, anyway, i think what he might want is 0700
2008-12-26T20:20:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Pici	which is rwx for root only
2010-01-14T22:22:00.000Z	Pici	onetinsoldier	No, its standard
2010-01-14T22:22:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Pici	oh? wow
2010-01-27T23:35:00.000Z	Pici	onetinsoldier	Take a look at the other error.
2010-01-27T23:35:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Pici	ok
2010-01-27T23:39:00.000Z	Pici	onetinsoldier	the fqdn message is a warning and will not stop the server from running.   The message that 0.0.0.0:80 is in use will stop the server from running if it is use.
2010-01-27T23:40:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Pici	ok, roger
2010-01-31T07:56:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Pici	roger. thanks. i think things have change in that regard since the last i knew
