2008-09-03T09:21:00.000Z	joanki123		as in i want fee2 or something to appear as decimal
2008-09-03T09:21:00.000Z	joanki123		so i mean convert text in hex to decimal integers
2008-09-03T09:23:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	joanki123	echo "texttoconvert" |  xxd  -c 256 -ps
2008-09-03T09:23:00.000Z	joanki123		can anyone tell me what cmd i would need to type in terminal to convert text in hex to its decimal representation please?
2008-09-03T09:23:00.000Z	joanki123	Megaqwerty	thanks
2008-09-03T09:23:00.000Z	joanki123		hey isn't there an easier way, Megaqwerty
2008-09-03T09:23:00.000Z	joanki123		?
2008-09-03T09:24:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	joanki123	Possibly, I'll take a look
2008-09-03T09:24:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	joanki123	not using xxd
2008-09-03T09:25:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	joanki123	you could use a python script to do it
2008-09-03T09:25:00.000Z	joanki123	Megaqwerty	there has to be a simple cmd line argument that does a quick onscreen conversion
2008-09-03T09:26:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	joanki123	not that I know of, but as I said, you could have a python script make it easy, and then alias the script so all you'd have to type is "converthex"
2008-09-03T09:26:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	joanki123	would you like me to help you with that?
2008-09-03T09:27:00.000Z	joanki123	Megaqwerty	that would be AWESOME
2008-09-03T09:28:00.000Z	joanki123		btw, when i do this: "echo "fff" | xxd -c 256 -ps", Megaqwerty , the result is 6666660a
2008-09-03T09:28:00.000Z	joanki123		shouldn't it be 111111111111?
2008-09-03T09:29:00.000Z	joanki123		in binary, that is
2008-09-03T09:29:00.000Z	joanki123		nm!
2008-09-03T09:29:00.000Z	joanki123		whatever the case, the result is wrong
2008-09-03T09:29:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	joanki123	it's how you are interpreting hex
