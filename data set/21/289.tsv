2012-03-25T03:17:00.000Z	haydenhummel		What version of Ubuntu are you wishing to install?
2012-03-25T03:17:00.000Z	haydenhummel		I can help you.
2012-03-25T03:18:00.000Z	haydenhummel		Susy you don't need to. Ubiguity the installer used by Ubuntu does it all fo ryou. Just choose the option install byside windows.
2012-03-25T03:19:00.000Z	SusyLegs	haydenhummel	so I dont need to use a partition program to create partitions before installing Ubuntu alongside W7?  Will ubuntu create a second partitoon for me for Ubuntu and a third partitioon for swap?
2012-03-25T03:20:00.000Z	SusyLegs	haydenhummel	 but will ubuntu installer create a second partitoon for me for Ubuntu and a third partitioon for swap?
2012-03-25T03:21:00.000Z	haydenhummel	SusyLegs	Yes it will.

2012-03-25T03:27:00.000Z	haydenhummel	SusyLegs	Just use TrueCrypt
2012-03-25T03:30:00.000Z	haydenhummel	SusyLegs	Yes. Just chose the option to do so.
2012-03-25T03:33:00.000Z	haydenhummel	SusyLegs	Why do you want your system to be this secure? Is it all not a bit over the top?
2012-03-25T03:34:00.000Z	haydenhummel	SusyLegs	As we have all already said; yes.
2012-03-25T03:34:00.000Z	SusyLegs	haydenhummel	ok hehe
2012-03-25T03:34:00.000Z	haydenhummel	SusyLegs	BitBleach

2012-03-25T03:36:00.000Z	SusyLegs	haydenhummel	the Ubunti Bot knows nothing about Bitbleach
2012-03-25T03:36:00.000Z	SusyLegs	haydenhummel	whats BitBleach and how does it work and what does it do and how much does it cost to buy?
2012-03-25T03:36:00.000Z	SusyLegs	haydenhummel	whats BitBleach and how does it work and what does it do?
2012-03-25T03:37:00.000Z	haydenhummel	SusyLegs	It clears up temp files such as cache memory. It's free and you can get it from the Ubuntu Software Cneter after you've installed Ubuntu.
2012-03-25T03:37:00.000Z	SusyLegs	haydenhummel	well that takes care of the security issues, thanks :)
