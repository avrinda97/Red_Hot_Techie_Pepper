2009-12-20T09:25:00.000Z	purpley		If I use truecrypt to encrypt my HDD will GRUB be effected in any way?
2009-12-20T09:26:00.000Z	DasEi1	purpley	you can't use whole disk, container only, no prob with grub
2009-12-20T09:26:00.000Z	DasEi1	purpley	see above, needs a frsh install then
2009-12-20T09:29:00.000Z	DasEi1	purpley	resize with gparted
2009-12-20T09:31:00.000Z	DasEi1	purpley	no, depends on ram and if you'll hibernate only
2009-12-20T09:32:00.000Z	DasEi1	purpley	free, see above
2009-12-20T09:33:00.000Z	DasEi1	purpley	so 3.5, will hou use hibernation ?
2009-12-20T09:37:00.000Z	DasEi1	purpley	at this amount of ram don't really need swap, or ado you plan big apps ? 2 gig will be be enough, and tie down swaiiness
2009-12-20T10:57:00.000Z	DasEi1	purpley	you won't , drive mussn't be mounted
2009-12-20T10:57:00.000Z	DasEi1	purpley	also, if you did, must update fstab and grub afterwards
2009-12-20T10:59:00.000Z	DasEi1	purpley	install gparted
2009-12-20T11:01:00.000Z	DasEi1	purpley	which distro ?
