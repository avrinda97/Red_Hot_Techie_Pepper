2007-07-01T13:58:00.000Z	maxagaz		what tool should I use to be able to resume my download with firefox ?
2007-07-01T13:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	maxagaz	wget -c
2007-07-01T13:58:00.000Z	maxagaz	Jordan_U	dawn`chorus: you mean in a terminal ?
2007-07-01T13:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	maxagaz	Yes, run it in the same directory as the file ( "cd Desktop" before running the command ) and then do: wget -c URL
2007-07-01T14:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	maxagaz	It should continue where it left off
2007-07-01T14:01:00.000Z	maxagaz	Jordan_U	dawn`chorus: I know that, my question was a general question, I mean how to be able to resume a download launched with firefox ?
2007-07-10T08:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	maxagaz	What happens when you try to boot?
2007-07-10T08:20:00.000Z	maxagaz	Jordan_U	a grey screen, an apple at the center of the screen, and a small animation showing that it's trying to load something
2007-07-10T08:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	maxagaz	Ahh, then it is trying to boot OSx and is failing
2007-07-10T08:21:00.000Z	maxagaz	Jordan_U	what should I do ?
2007-07-10T08:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	maxagaz	Did OSx shutdown incorrectly ( if it did then by default it will bypass refit and boot OSx, you can configure refit to boot even after OSx is shut down incorrectly though )
2007-07-10T08:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	maxagaz	And how did you re-install refit if the system won't boot?
2007-07-10T08:23:00.000Z	maxagaz	Jordan_U	I don't know, it's not my computer actually, I don't know what happend
2007-07-10T08:23:00.000Z	maxagaz	Jordan_U	I reinstalled it using the LiveCD
2007-07-10T08:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	maxagaz	rEFIt or Ubuntu?
2007-07-10T08:24:00.000Z	maxagaz	Jordan_U	refit
2007-07-20T11:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	maxagaz	No
2007-07-20T11:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	maxagaz	At least if there is an fsck for HFS+ I wouldn't trust it
2007-07-20T11:31:00.000Z	maxagaz	Jordan_U	why?
2007-07-20T11:31:00.000Z	maxagaz	Jordan_U	what would you do then ?
2007-07-20T11:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	maxagaz	Because write support is still sketchy and doesn't even support journaling
