2008-01-30T06:07:00.000Z	histo	singlesun1	just use XMDCP or any other remote conneciton type system.
2008-01-30T06:08:00.000Z	histo	singlesun1	vnc etc...
2008-01-30T06:08:00.000Z	singlesun1	histo	basically what software will allow my desktop box to function as various different servers?
2008-01-30T06:08:00.000Z	histo	singlesun1	you could use a virtual machine type thing.
2008-01-30T06:08:00.000Z	histo	singlesun1	virtualbox
2008-01-30T06:09:00.000Z	singlesun1	histo	virtualbox is a free app?
2008-01-30T06:09:00.000Z	singlesun1	histo	can virtualbox run server OS's on a computer that is configured as a client and not a server though?
2008-01-30T06:10:00.000Z	histo	singlesun1	yes and they have versions for windows, linux etc...
2008-01-30T06:10:00.000Z	histo	singlesun1	you install it and you can create emulated computers inside of any os and install any OS you want.
2008-01-30T06:11:00.000Z	singlesun1	histo	and you can connect to these various emulated OS's correct via another machine?
2008-01-30T06:11:00.000Z	histo	singlesun1	yeap
2008-01-30T06:11:00.000Z	singlesun1	histo	excellent, thats much help
2008-01-30T06:11:00.000Z	histo	singlesun1	or locally on the same machine the choice is up to you.
2008-01-30T06:11:00.000Z	histo	singlesun1	its similiar to vmware if you are familiar with that.  Virtualbox is a free alternative.
2008-01-30T06:12:00.000Z	singlesun1	histo	yes ;) that was my concern, vmware is not cheap
2008-01-30T06:12:00.000Z	histo	singlesun1	virtualbox is free
