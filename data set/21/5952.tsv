2007-07-03T10:54:00.000Z	bendover		hey, im trying to run tasksel but I get a wierd error about debconf failing to run
2007-07-03T10:55:00.000Z	Jamesinator	bendover	It would help if you told us the specific error
2007-07-03T10:56:00.000Z	bendover	Jamesinator	just waiting for someone to let me know they are here... http://www.pastebin.ca/600916

2007-07-03T11:00:00.000Z	Jamesinator	bendover	Essentially, it's a problem with debconf that's supposed to be getting fixed in a new version
2007-07-03T11:01:00.000Z	bendover	Jamesinator	yes, i read that before, but i still can't solve the issue
2007-07-03T11:01:00.000Z	Jamesinator	bendover	Correct, you can't
2007-07-03T11:01:00.000Z	bendover	Jamesinator	so how do I run tasksel ?
2007-07-03T11:02:00.000Z	Jamesinator	bendover	According to that bug report, it's broken until the next version comes out. You can try to update it, but as I barely know what it is I wouldn't know if it's fixed yet
2007-07-03T11:02:00.000Z	bendover	Jamesinator	so my only fix is reinstalling the system ?
2007-07-03T11:03:00.000Z	Jamesinator	bendover	No...
2007-07-03T11:03:00.000Z	bendover	Jamesinator	 I'm all ears... erm, eyes...
2007-07-03T11:03:00.000Z	Jamesinator	bendover	The fix is in debconf itself. Unless the new system has the updated version of debconf, that won't do anything
2007-07-03T11:03:00.000Z	Jamesinator	bendover	What I'm saying is, until you can update your version of debconf, you're screwed
2007-07-03T11:04:00.000Z	bendover	Jamesinator	so what I said, a total reinstall, is the only fix.
2007-07-03T11:04:00.000Z	Jamesinator	bendover	Yes, sure, reinstall your system so that it can have the same version of the app that has the problem, and you'll have a new system to configure and the same problem
2007-07-03T11:04:00.000Z	Jamesinator	bendover	Alternatively, wait until the new version of debconf comes out and update debconf.
2007-07-03T11:05:00.000Z	bendover	Jamesinator	tasksel crashed, and ever since then this is happening
2007-07-03T11:05:00.000Z	Jamesinator	bendover	Look, I'm just telling you what was in the bug report, and unless you can update your version of debconf, you won't be able to fix this
2007-07-03T11:09:00.000Z	bendover	Jamesinator	what I mean is that my system cashed today while using debconf, and now a lot of things are crashing and im thinking it had something to do with that
2007-07-03T11:09:00.000Z	Jamesinator	bendover	Sorry, but I can't diagnose your system, I'm only relating what the bug report said.
