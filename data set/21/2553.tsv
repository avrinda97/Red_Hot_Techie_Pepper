2009-09-06T15:42:00.000Z	etbl		hi, i'm currently installing a piece of software, and the instructions tell me to run the commands: cd dir-to-software; ./configure --prefix=/instdir --sysconfdir=/instdir/conf;  make; # but it said to run the commands as a specific user (it told me to create the user earlier in the install instructions).  i accidentally ran these commands as root instead.  my questions are a) what do these commands actually do?  does ./configure do
2009-09-06T15:43:00.000Z	etbl		from which its run?
2009-09-06T15:44:00.000Z	etbl		in other words, if i simply delete the directory from which i ran these commands, will my system be in an identical state as it would be if i had never downloaded/installed the software?
2009-09-06T15:45:00.000Z	kholzer	etbl	probably not.
2009-09-06T15:45:00.000Z	kholzer	etbl	did you make install?
2009-09-06T15:45:00.000Z	etbl	kholzer	how can i entirely "undo" these commands?
2009-09-06T15:45:00.000Z	etbl	kholzer	its a rather obscure piece of software
2009-09-06T15:46:00.000Z	kholzer	etbl	did you run `make install'?
2009-09-06T15:46:00.000Z	kholzer	etbl	which software?
2009-09-06T15:46:00.000Z	etbl	kholzer	its called evergreen, library management system
2009-09-06T15:47:00.000Z	etbl	kholzer	no, only 'make'
2009-09-06T15:48:00.000Z	kholzer	etbl	is /install there?
2009-09-06T15:49:00.000Z	kholzer	etbl	rather, is there a /install in your system?
2009-09-06T15:51:00.000Z	etbl	kholzer	do you mean is there a file called install in my root directory?
2009-09-06T15:52:00.000Z	kholzer	etbl	yes
2009-09-06T15:52:00.000Z	kholzer	etbl	if you ran the configure just like that...
2009-09-06T15:56:00.000Z	etbl	kholzer	no, there's not any file called /install
2009-09-06T15:56:00.000Z	kholzer	etbl	it probably didn't install anything then.
2009-09-06T15:57:00.000Z	etbl	kholzer	why would u think there'd be a file called /install?
2009-09-06T15:58:00.000Z	kholzer	etbl	I guess insdir rather.  You had said you typed in: './configure --prefix=/instdir --sysconfdir=/instdir/conf;  make;'
2009-09-06T15:59:00.000Z	etbl	kholzer	yes, exactly
