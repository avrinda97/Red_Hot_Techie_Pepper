2010-09-26T22:47:00.000Z	kaspir	JohnHeikkila	The window borders are transparent and some windows (like the terminal) are a yellow green and displays no text
2010-09-26T22:48:00.000Z	kaspir	JohnHeikkila	ok Ill give it a try
2010-09-26T22:49:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	kaspir	Then, right-click the icon and "Select Window Manager". Tell us which window manager is on use
2010-09-26T22:56:00.000Z	kaspir	JohnHeikkila	I can't tell you how annoying it is to run terminal commands when I can't see what I'm doing lol
2010-09-26T22:57:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	kaspir	You could also install fusion-icon via Synaptic
2010-09-26T22:58:00.000Z	kaspir	JohnHeikkila	Wow I feel smart now. That's what I get for neglecting my morning coffee
2010-09-26T22:59:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	kaspir	:D do you want to move to #ubuntu-offtopic to chat about your coffee with me?
2010-09-26T22:59:00.000Z	kaspir	JohnHeikkila	You said run it with alt+F2 right? And as long as you'll still help me with this then yes lol
2010-09-26T23:00:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	kaspir	After you have installed 'fusion-icon', run it by pressing ALT+F2 then typing 'fusion-icon'
2010-09-26T23:00:00.000Z	kaspir	JohnHeikkila	Alt+F2 isn't bringing anything up
2010-09-26T23:00:00.000Z	kaspir	JohnHeikkila	I'm using 10.04 if that changes anything
2010-09-26T23:01:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	kaspir	Ohh..weard. Then run it from Applications-->System tools-->Compiz Fusion Icon
2010-09-26T23:01:00.000Z	kaspir	JohnHeikkila	its in the task bar, but it wont open a window
2010-09-26T23:02:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	kaspir	Right-Click it
2010-09-26T23:02:00.000Z	kaspir	JohnHeikkila	Ah you rock it works now
2010-09-26T23:03:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	kaspir	Good. Then click the Select Window Manager and tell me what is selected?
2010-09-26T23:04:00.000Z	kaspir	JohnHeikkila	it was 'compiz' but I changed it to metacity and reloaded it, and now it works perfectly :D
