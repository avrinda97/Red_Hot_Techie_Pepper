2006-09-04T12:41:00.000Z	canine_kouji	macness	if you need a wireless card to work, I recommend ndiswrapper ;)
2006-09-04T12:43:00.000Z	canine_kouji	macness	I've had ndiswrapper not work well, try drivers for different OSes(win98, 2k, xp) then try different versions of the drivers for it. make sure a linux module isn't trying to load by blacklisting the module, as I've had that as a showstopper
2006-09-04T12:46:00.000Z	canine_kouji	macness	some cards have drivers for win98, 2k, nt, and xp. 2k drivers usually work if the xp drivers dont
2006-09-04T12:49:00.000Z	canine_kouji	macness	out of curiousity, which card do you have?
2006-09-04T12:49:00.000Z	canine_kouji	macness	please say bcm42xx
2006-09-04T12:50:00.000Z	canine_kouji	macness	oh no! ::/
2006-09-04T12:50:00.000Z	canine_kouji	macness	I know why its not working, you didn't take a look at dmesg
2006-09-04T12:50:00.000Z	canine_kouji	macness	you must extract the firmware out of the drivers included for bcm43xx and place them in /lib/firmware
2006-09-04T12:53:00.000Z	macness	canine_kouji	dmesg?
2006-09-04T12:53:00.000Z	canine_kouji	macness	dmesg|grep .fw
