2010-06-26T23:56:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	notmorewindows	you have created a new basic xorg.cof file hopefully now you should have gui without needing to edit it any more (hopefully) if your on tty just type startx otherwise ctrl+alt+backspace (however, I aint sure if that works anymore)
2010-06-26T23:46:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	notmorewindows	that is pretty straightforward instructions
2010-06-26T23:51:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	notmorewindows	I mean the error tells you what to do in the last line i.e just run `nvidia-xconfig` as root - type in terminal/tty windows sudo nvidia-xconfig and follow the instructions on screen
2010-06-26T23:58:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	notmorewindows	the setting wont come into action unless you restart gdm or your system?
2010-06-26T23:59:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	notmorewindows	like I said hopefully that should be enough to get you running however you may need to ass custom settings to that file in which case someone else will need to help you with that as I dont have nvidia
2010-06-26T23:59:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	notmorewindows	  ass>add
2010-06-27T00:03:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	notmorewindows	restart xserver, menaing restart xserver I already told you how to either that or restart the system and you should see the difference
2010-06-27T00:05:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	notmorewindows	it is easy just like learning french or any other language I guess I couldn't help you
2010-06-27T00:07:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	notmorewindows	ddi you follow my instruction did you sudo nvidia..etc and did the new file get created in /etc/X11/xorg.conf if so what is the problem?
2010-07-03T19:31:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	notmorewindows	just check if pulse or alsautils detects your soundcard and it is configured properly
2010-07-03T19:34:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	notmorewindows	eeeerh ok it is good to know I was useful somehow *shocked*
