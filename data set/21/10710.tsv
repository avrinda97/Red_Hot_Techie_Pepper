2004-12-14T07:46:00.000Z	zooko		waaaitaminute.  Running dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg doesn't change /etc/X11/xorg.conf...  Hm.
2004-12-14T07:47:00.000Z	Kamion	zooko	have you changed that file yourself?
2004-12-14T07:48:00.000Z	zooko	Kamion	yes
2004-12-14T07:48:00.000Z	Kamion	zooko	did you read the directions at the top of xorg.conf?
2004-12-14T11:10:00.000Z	Kamion	zooko	try 'dpkg-reconfigure locales' and make sure that en_CA.UTF-8 is actually generated
2004-12-16T09:59:00.000Z	Kamion	zooko	network interfaces in promiscuous mode can often be detected remotely
2004-12-16T10:01:00.000Z	zooko	Kamion	yes, but I'm mildly suprised that they actually do that.
2005-04-03T08:58:00.000Z	Kamion	zooko	anything other than IRC :-) ubuntu-users@lists.ubuntu.com would be reasonable
2005-04-03T08:58:00.000Z	Kamion	zooko	I'm surprised it's not in universe/multiverse though?
2005-04-03T08:58:00.000Z	Kamion	zooko	they do so :)
2005-04-03T08:59:00.000Z	Kamion	zooko	all architectures have all components
2005-04-03T08:59:00.000Z	Kamion	zooko	ghc6 built successfully on amd64
2005-04-03T09:00:00.000Z	Kamion	zooko	warty/universe didn't have ghc6, though
2005-04-04T09:45:00.000Z	zooko	Kamion	the fact that Ubuntu has a timeline for future releases should make that "you know" notice much cooler.
2005-04-04T09:45:00.000Z	Kamion	zooko	"question" is a technical term here; the question type would indeed by "note
2005-04-04T10:49:00.000Z	Kamion	zooko	it's in universe for both warty and hoary
2005-04-04T10:49:00.000Z	zooko	Kamion	Thanks.
2005-04-04T11:06:00.000Z	Kamion	zooko	think of it as a matrix: main == supported/free, restricted == supported/non-free, universe == unsupported/free, multiverse == unsupported/non-free
2005-04-04T11:07:00.000Z	zooko	Kamion	Thanks for the clarification about restricted.
2005-04-04T14:01:00.000Z	Kamion	zooko	http://morgue.ubuntu.com/
2005-04-04T14:02:00.000Z	Kamion	zooko	mm, we'd rather it weren't widely advertised as such because it would reduce the incentive for us to fix things :)
