2006-09-01T08:28:00.000Z	paradizelost	matthewf	what type of vid. card?
2006-09-01T08:30:00.000Z	paradizelost	matthewf	pastebin a copy of your xorg.conf
2006-09-01T08:31:00.000Z	matthewf	paradizelost	pastebin.com/781071
2006-09-01T08:33:00.000Z	matthewf	paradizelost	does that xorg.conf look ok to you ?
2006-09-01T08:34:00.000Z	paradizelost	matthewf	did you install the nvidia drivers from their site?
2006-09-01T08:34:00.000Z	matthewf	paradizelost	no i used the instuctions on the ubuntu help
2006-09-01T08:36:00.000Z	paradizelost	matthewf	it's also possible you might need to change the 24 to a 16.
2006-09-01T08:36:00.000Z	matthewf	paradizelost	16bit is rather... pointless for the use that this machine will have
2006-09-01T08:37:00.000Z	paradizelost	matthewf	i'm just saying that some screens can't run at native in 24bit
2006-09-01T08:41:00.000Z	paradizelost	matthewf	edit your /etc/X11/xorg.conf and change the display lines that say 24 to say 16 and restart X
2006-09-01T08:47:00.000Z	paradizelost	matthewf	if you do an lsmod|grep nvidia does it show anything?
2006-09-01T08:48:00.000Z	matthewf	paradizelost	yes it does
2006-09-01T08:49:00.000Z	paradizelost	matthewf	if you do an       glxinfo
2006-09-01T08:49:00.000Z	paradizelost	matthewf	at the top does it say Direct Rendering: YEs
2006-09-01T08:49:00.000Z	matthewf	paradizelost	yes it does...basicly for all intents and purposes this should be working but it isnt ...
2006-09-01T08:50:00.000Z	paradizelost	matthewf	did you change the 24 to 16?
2006-09-01T08:50:00.000Z	matthewf	paradizelost	yep i did that
2006-09-01T08:51:00.000Z	matthewf	paradizelost	is it worth it to rebuilt an xorg.conf ?
2006-09-01T08:51:00.000Z	paradizelost	matthewf	can't hurt
