2008-09-01T23:38:00.000Z	rohit		can you plz tell me why should i apply extra visual effects
2008-09-01T23:38:00.000Z	pdaous4	rohit	to impress your friends and make them want Linux :-)
2008-09-01T23:40:00.000Z	pdaous4	rohit	hm, that's weird. What sort of video card do you have?
2008-09-01T23:42:00.000Z	pdaous4	rohit	okay, so it looks like you have an nVidia card. If you could go to the terminal and type in the command 'glxgears' -- does anything happen? You should get a black window with some gears rotating in it
2008-09-01T23:44:00.000Z	pdaous4	rohit	it's an nVidia, onboard.
2008-09-01T23:46:00.000Z	pdaous4	rohit	thats weird; a Google search told me that your laptop was a GeForce Go5200
2008-09-01T23:47:00.000Z	pdaous4	rohit	did you try running 'glxgears' from the command line? What happened?
2008-09-01T23:48:00.000Z	pdaous4	rohit	hm. interesting. So you probably have an Intel 940 or 945 graphics chip. Did glxgears work?
2008-09-01T23:50:00.000Z	pdaous4	rohit	ah, there's the problem. (I'll explain the URL thing in a bit; for now, type in the command ScheissDroge1 suggested (ï»¿sudo apt-get install hwinfo pastebinit && sudo hwinfo | pastebinit)
2008-09-01T23:50:00.000Z	pdaous4	rohit	this will give us more info about your hardware.
2008-09-01T23:53:00.000Z	pdaous4	rohit	go to http://www.pastebin.com, paste the info into the form there, and submit it. Then just give us the URL that pastebin.com gives you.
2008-09-01T23:57:00.000Z	pdaous4	rohit	thanks
2008-09-01T23:59:00.000Z	pdaous4	rohit	ScheissDroge1: it looks like the output didn't get piped properly. rohit, retry just this part of the command: sudo hwinfo | pastebinit
2008-09-02T00:00:00.000Z	pdaous4	rohit	whoa, you're right; it doesn't give a URL!
2008-09-02T00:04:00.000Z	pdaous4	rohit	that's weird; hwinfo isn't passing its output properly. Do this: sudo hwinfo > hwinfo.log
2008-09-02T00:05:00.000Z	pdaous4	rohit	yup
2008-09-02T00:05:00.000Z	pdaous4	rohit	both commands will take a while.
2008-09-02T00:06:00.000Z	pdaous4	rohit	they will both not give you any feedback either.
2008-09-02T00:16:00.000Z	pdaous4	rohit	okay, so let's figure out what's going on. could you type the command glxinfo | pastebinit and give us the URL?
2008-09-02T00:20:00.000Z	pdaous4	rohit	okay,, so 3D isn't working right now. If I could get you to pastebin two files... first run "pastebinit -i /var/log/Xorg.log" and then run "pastebinit -i /etc/X11/xorg.conf" (don't include the " marks)
2008-09-02T00:25:00.000Z	pdaous4	rohit	run the second command, and I'll see how your server is set up.
