2011-03-22T10:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ac7ss	you will still need to install the DVD codec, then ANY player will be able to play DVDs
2011-03-22T11:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ac7ss	sure but its very insecure and uses 2 ports (wasteful)
2011-03-22T11:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ac7ss	its great to ssh from work to home, then launch irssi and chat
2011-03-22T11:35:00.000Z	ac7ss	ActionParsnip	That is what I am doing now.
2011-03-22T11:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ac7ss	i'll be doing the sameon my 12 hour shift tonight too :)
2011-03-22T11:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ac7ss	its also fun to run web browsers over X and play the sound through the serving sound device (also funny at 4am blaring out some Meshuggah to bother the neighbours ;))
2011-03-22T11:40:00.000Z	ac7ss	ActionParsnip	I use mpg123 to play songs to my wife when she is on the computer.

2011-03-22T11:41:00.000Z	ac7ss	ActionParsnip	I will have to look into espeak...

2011-03-24T11:33:00.000Z	ac7ss	ActionParsnip	I find it interesting that babelfish.altavista.com still works.
2011-03-24T11:34:00.000Z	ac7ss	ActionParsnip	it's just a very old web address. (one of the first as far as I know.)
2011-03-24T11:39:00.000Z	ac7ss	ActionParsnip	it was assimilated by yahoo. I would have expected them to change the name....
