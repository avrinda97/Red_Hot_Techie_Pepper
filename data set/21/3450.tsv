2009-10-11T08:03:00.000Z	prince_jammys	nic1	rm -r ~/.local/share/Trash/*
2009-10-11T08:07:00.000Z	prince_jammys	nic1	what is the output of ls -l ~/.ICEauthority ?
2009-10-11T08:08:00.000Z	nic1	prince_jammys	output is -rw--------- username username 2862
2009-10-11T08:08:00.000Z	prince_jammys	nic1	ok, that's fine.
2009-10-11T08:09:00.000Z	prince_jammys	nic1	yes, once for the user, another for the group. I assume 'username' is your user's name.
2009-10-11T08:09:00.000Z	prince_jammys	nic1	look in the forums for your error message. I've seen posts about it.
2009-10-11T08:10:00.000Z	prince_jammys	nic1	look for "your session lasted less than 10 seconds" or whatever it says. You'll get hits both from the forums and from google.
2009-10-15T08:19:00.000Z	prince_jammys	nic1	means you probably don't have permission to write to your present directory
2009-10-15T08:20:00.000Z	nic1	prince_jammys	how can i give permissions
2009-10-15T08:20:00.000Z	prince_jammys	nic1	is this some kind of installer script? if so, you'd run it as superuser, with sudo.
2009-10-15T08:21:00.000Z	nic1	prince_jammys	i am trying to install a package
2009-10-15T08:21:00.000Z	nic1	prince_jammys	ok sudo works
2009-10-15T08:22:00.000Z	prince_jammys	nic1	you don't have to. only when you make install.
2009-10-15T12:20:00.000Z	prince_jammys	nic1	infers the wrong channel. /join ##c , likely.
2009-10-17T16:33:00.000Z	prince_jammys	nic1	dpkg -i pack.deb
2009-10-17T16:33:00.000Z	prince_jammys	nic1	well, sudo the above.
