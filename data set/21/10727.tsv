2011-11-06T21:15:00.000Z	spot_		so i can install windows xp
2011-11-06T21:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	spot_	 then you want to reparition.. not reformat..
2011-11-06T21:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	spot_	 use gparted on a live cd, delete all the partitions let windows remake them. or make some ntfs partitions with gparted
2011-11-06T21:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	spot_	 delete all what?
2011-11-06T21:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	spot_	 i think you need to start over from the beginning and be more clear...
2011-11-06T21:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	spot_	 so you want to remove allof linux and have just a xp system?
2011-11-06T21:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	spot_	 so you are planning on reinstalling xp also?
2011-11-06T21:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	spot_	 you will want to use a windows cd/restore cd. to reinstall teh windows bootloader to get windows booting first. then i would go about deleteing the linux setup.
2011-11-06T21:23:00.000Z	dr_willis	spot_	 you said you dident want to reinstall windows.. you just need to get to the windows recovery console and reinstall the windows bootloader.
2011-11-06T21:24:00.000Z	dr_willis	spot_	 you have any impiorntant stuff on the disks you want to keep? if so - id syggest using a live cd and backing them up.
2011-11-06T21:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	spot_	 see #windows channel it depends on the version.
2011-11-06T21:32:00.000Z	dr_willis	spot_	 you have not proven its grubs fault. and grub on the hd would not stop a windows cd from booting
2011-11-06T21:32:00.000Z	dr_willis	spot_	 i do suggest you use a live cd to backup anything imporntant on the system first
2011-11-06T21:33:00.000Z	dr_willis	spot_	 so now.. we are back to you wanting to fix grub... earlier you were wanting to delete grub and linux...
2011-11-06T21:34:00.000Z	dr_willis	spot_	 will you make up your mind...
