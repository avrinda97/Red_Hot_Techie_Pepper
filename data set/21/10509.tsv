2005-03-06T14:27:00.000Z	Xappe		when Hoary is stable I probably already is in the middle of a grumpy upgrade :P
2005-03-06T14:28:00.000Z	emanuelez	Xappe	r u facing issues with the new nautilus?
2005-03-06T14:28:00.000Z	Xappe	emanuelez	what issues?
2005-03-06T14:29:00.000Z	Xappe	emanuelez	nah, the only serious problems i've had today was the lockups caused by the 2.6.10-4 kernel
2005-03-06T14:30:00.000Z	Xappe	emanuelez	since when do you have these nautilus problems?
2005-03-06T14:31:00.000Z	emanuelez	Xappe	my last dist-upgrade both contained the new kernel and new nautilus
2005-03-06T14:31:00.000Z	Xappe	emanuelez	could be the kernel then...
2005-03-06T14:32:00.000Z	emanuelez	Xappe	i see... oh well... i'm sure it will be fixed soon
2005-03-06T14:32:00.000Z	Xappe	emanuelez	total freeze at gnome login...
2005-03-06T14:32:00.000Z	emanuelez	Xappe	yes
2005-03-06T14:32:00.000Z	Xappe	emanuelez	try booting with the .3 kernel
2005-03-06T14:33:00.000Z	Xappe	emanuelez	that should get you back to normal for now
2005-03-06T14:33:00.000Z	Xappe	emanuelez	you don't trust resume? :)
2005-03-06T14:33:00.000Z	emanuelez	Xappe	yeah... easy way to test it it's because of the kernel or gnome
2005-03-06T14:34:00.000Z	emanuelez	Xappe	not when i'm downloading full speed and i'm 90% done LOL
2005-03-06T14:35:00.000Z	Xappe	emanuelez	hehe. I get lousy speeds with BT. I'm behind a huge NAT that i can't do anything about
2005-03-06T14:36:00.000Z	emanuelez	Xappe	ouch.. that sucks... i know latest BT versions should improve performances behind NAT if i'm not wrong
2005-03-06T14:37:00.000Z	Xappe	emanuelez	well...the internal network is jammed with wormtraffic and porn leechers
2005-03-06T14:38:00.000Z	emanuelez	Xappe	that sucks :( not referred to porn LOL
2005-06-16T16:07:00.000Z	Xappe	emanuelez	you can edit the /etc/cups/cupsd.conf to fit your needs
2005-06-16T16:09:00.000Z	emanuelez	Xappe	i think i'll try that :)
