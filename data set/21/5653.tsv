2007-09-05T10:11:00.000Z	danieldan		revildodral: problem is I just bought this thing... it recognizes the wireless network, but as if it didnt have any signal strength and with a lock next to it, i really dont know what to do
2007-09-05T10:12:00.000Z	amidaniel	danieldan	Is it a secured network? When you try to connect to it does it prompt you for a key?
2007-09-05T10:14:00.000Z	danieldan	amidaniel	yeahits my router that has WEP key and I have it but nothing works
2007-09-05T10:15:00.000Z	amidaniel	danieldan	"nothing works" ... what does it do when you select the network from network manager?
2007-09-05T10:16:00.000Z	danieldan	amidaniel	and it jost says "conexion failed"

2007-09-05T10:22:00.000Z	danieldan	amidaniel	yes
2007-09-05T10:23:00.000Z	amidaniel	danieldan	select eth1 from the list and hit preferences
2007-09-05T10:25:00.000Z	danieldan	amidaniel	ok done then??
2007-09-05T10:26:00.000Z	amidaniel	danieldan	Is roaming mode selected?
2007-09-05T10:27:00.000Z	danieldan	amidaniel	actually no!... i configured it just as I did before in another laptop...
2007-09-05T10:28:00.000Z	amidaniel	danieldan	Oh, okay, try enabling that and then restart nm-applet ... I find that's typically a must for wireless cards
2007-09-05T10:29:00.000Z	danieldan	amidaniel	ammm how do i do that???
2007-09-05T10:31:00.000Z	amidaniel	danieldan	From preferences on eth1 under nm ... it should restart automatically once you apply the changes, but if it doesn't, nuke it from top or system monitor
2007-09-05T10:32:00.000Z	danieldan	amidaniel	ok ill try and ill beback in a sec
