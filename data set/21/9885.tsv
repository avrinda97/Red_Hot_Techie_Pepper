2005-11-22T11:56:00.000Z	heien		Anyone, please give feedback?
2005-11-22T11:56:00.000Z	heien		Hi everyone. Where can i insert a code which starts with: "diff -Naur kernel/signal.c.orig kernel/signal.c"  ? In the kernel somewhere?
2005-11-22T11:57:00.000Z	heien		exported in kernels prior to 2.6.10, but isn't any more.  I didn't
2005-11-22T11:57:00.000Z	heien		investigate further why this change was made but instead made the
2005-11-22T11:57:00.000Z	heien		following change which did the job.
2005-11-22T11:57:00.000Z	nalioth	heien	please read the /topic. pasting is rude
2005-11-22T11:58:00.000Z	heien	nalioth	if you're a bot, fu, if you're a person, im sorry abut the paste. :/
2005-11-22T12:01:00.000Z	nalioth	heien	how about qemu?
2005-11-22T12:02:00.000Z	heien	nalioth	qemu would just let me run a windows session emulated, wouldnt it?
2005-11-22T12:02:00.000Z	nalioth	heien	there is a method to crossover, iirc
2005-11-22T12:03:00.000Z	heien	nalioth	 could you explain it?
2005-11-22T12:06:00.000Z	heien	nalioth	im aware of what it does, but how do i access my ntfs drive with read/write, without loading a new OS?
2005-11-22T12:07:00.000Z	nalioth	heien	read / write access for ntfs is quite problematic. you may run captiventfs or the other one, but i personally do not recommend writing to ntfs from linux
2005-11-22T12:08:00.000Z	heien	nalioth	Is there any method to convert my ntfs to fat32? or just anyhow be able to write to the partion in question
2005-11-22T12:09:00.000Z	nalioth	heien	you may xfer all your files to ext3 and convert it using GNU tools, or use the commercial Partition Magic to convert it
2005-11-22T12:10:00.000Z	heien	nalioth	i have a hd on 160 gigs, with a 30gb partion for linux, and a 130gb partion with ntfs _ONLY_ for storing files. i just want to be able to use my 130 gig partion, without deleting the data on it.
2005-11-22T12:11:00.000Z	nalioth	heien	i suggest you back up what you want to keep, and use qtparted to resize your ntfs partition. make a new fat32 partition (if you want to share with windows) or an ext3 one
2005-11-22T12:12:00.000Z	nalioth	heien	and start moving your things around til you get all fat32 or ext3
2005-11-22T12:13:00.000Z	nalioth	heien	it all depends on how much stuff you got on it
2005-11-22T12:14:00.000Z	heien	nalioth	100 gb, 30 free
2005-11-22T12:14:00.000Z	nalioth	heien	i'd add in the 80-gigger
