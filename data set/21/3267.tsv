2009-09-09T11:19:00.000Z	CatEater		i still can't get my vm window to appear on a windows xp host. i click on the taskbar button, but the window doesn't appear on screen. i know i've asked here before, but i forgot what to try. i'm using 3.0.4 r50677. any ideas?
2009-09-09T11:20:00.000Z	CatEater		also i just realized i said that to the wrong channel
2009-09-09T11:20:00.000Z	CatEater		however, if anyone can recommend a vm setup for unbuntu, that would be appreciated
2009-09-09T11:21:00.000Z	LogicFan	CatEater	you mean a VM app for ubuntu?
2009-09-09T11:21:00.000Z	LogicFan		or running ubuntu in a VM
2009-09-09T11:21:00.000Z	LogicFan		yeah virtualbox is great
2009-09-09T11:21:00.000Z	CatEater	LogicFan	i'm trying to run virtualbox on windows, with ubuntu as the guest os, and it won't work
2009-09-09T11:21:00.000Z	CatEater		i can't see the vm window
2009-09-09T11:22:00.000Z	LogicFan		sorry, don't know anything about virtualbox on windows
2009-09-09T11:22:00.000Z	CatEater		what do you run ubuntu on?
2009-09-09T11:22:00.000Z	LogicFan		my laptop
2009-09-09T11:22:00.000Z	CatEater		oh, i can't afford to do that
2009-09-09T11:22:00.000Z	LogicFan		?
2009-09-09T11:23:00.000Z	CatEater		i can't afford a laptop to run it on
2009-09-09T11:23:00.000Z	LogicFan		oh, my laptop is my main and only computer
2009-09-09T11:23:00.000Z	CatEater	LogicFan	yeah, that's my problem too
2009-09-09T11:24:00.000Z	LogicFan	CatEater	you can download the ubuntu windows installer
2009-09-09T11:24:00.000Z	CatEater		it's my only computer, and i don't have any other computer to run linux on, so vm is the only option
2009-09-09T11:24:00.000Z	LogicFan		!wubi
2009-09-09T11:24:00.000Z	CatEater		i tried that but it would stop my windows processes, which is unacceptable
2009-09-09T11:24:00.000Z	LogicFan	CatEater	and you dont want ubuntu as your primary os?
