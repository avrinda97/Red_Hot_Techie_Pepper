2009-08-08T22:42:00.000Z	livingdaylight		greetings! I come in peace
2009-08-08T22:43:00.000Z	eboyjr	livingdaylight	How can we help you today?
2009-08-08T22:44:00.000Z	livingdaylight	eboyjr	javaws is not working
2009-08-08T22:44:00.000Z	livingdaylight	eboyjr	javaws http://files.gokgs.com/javaBin/cgoban.jnlp
2009-08-08T22:44:00.000Z	livingdaylight	eboyjr	that's the entire command but bash says javaws command not found
2009-08-08T22:44:00.000Z	eboyjr	livingdaylight	Could you please tell me the release version of Ubuntu you are using?
2009-08-08T22:45:00.000Z	livingdaylight	eboyjr	9.04
2009-08-08T22:46:00.000Z	livingdaylight	eboyjr	just notcied that i don't have jvm folder in /usr/lib
2009-08-08T22:46:00.000Z	livingdaylight	eboyjr	yet, i clearly installed ubuntu-restricted-extras
2009-08-08T22:46:00.000Z	eboyjr	livingdaylight	Are you running 32-bit or 64-bit?
2009-08-08T22:46:00.000Z	livingdaylight	eboyjr	32 bit
2009-08-08T22:48:00.000Z	eboyjr	livingdaylight	Do you have package 'sun-java6-plugin' installed?
2009-08-08T22:48:00.000Z	livingdaylight	eboyjr	agues, not. I thought ubuntu-restricted-extras package took care of that
2009-08-08T22:49:00.000Z	eboyjr	livingdaylight	No, I believe that that package only takes care of the Java runtime environment. Install sun-java6-plugin and its dependencies and you should have it working.
2009-08-08T22:50:00.000Z	livingdaylight	eboyjr	installing sun-java now.. i dont' understand how ubuntu-restricted-extras could not have done that for me already
2009-08-08T22:52:00.000Z	eboyjr	livingdaylight	As I said, ubuntu-restricted-extras does not include the plugins for Mozilla Firefox and the like. Only for the JRE.
2009-08-08T22:54:00.000Z	livingdaylight	eboyjr	gosh, i'm sure it used, but maybe i'm going crazy... Sure would be nice if one day we didn't have to go chasing all these elements to make a normal working Desktop
2009-08-08T22:55:00.000Z	eboyjr	livingdaylight	One day, in a world free of proprietary software ;)
2009-08-08T22:55:00.000Z	livingdaylight	eboyjr	please, you'll depress me :(
2009-08-08T22:55:00.000Z	livingdaylight	eboyjr	:D
