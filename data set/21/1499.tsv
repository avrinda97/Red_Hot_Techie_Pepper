2011-10-26T08:51:00.000Z	okee		I attempted to install Ubuntu inside win 7 on an HP Elitebook 8560w, but the Linux installation wouldn't start on reboot.  Win 7 still works, and I am not able to get the laptop to detect a working DVD installation of Ubuntu. Laptop still goes to the menu giving you the option of selecting Ubuntu or Win 7.  How do I get the old edition of Ubuntu off of my computer?  I went into the bios and
2011-10-26T08:51:00.000Z	okee		didn't see many options.  HP has no support at all, and I just sent a letter to Meg Whitman requesting a refund.
2011-10-26T08:53:00.000Z	okee		Meg Whitman is the CEO of HP.
2011-10-26T08:53:00.000Z	okee		So How do I remove the remove apps on the control center?  is this in Win 7?
2011-10-26T08:53:00.000Z	okee		I don't see ubuntu as an installed software.
2011-10-26T08:54:00.000Z	okee		Are you referring to windows Or Ubuntu?
2011-10-26T08:55:00.000Z	okee		I don't think I saw it in there, but I will double check.
2011-10-26T08:56:00.000Z	okee		I am just booting into Win 7 now.
2011-10-26T08:58:00.000Z	okee		I don't see wubi in the add/remove area of Win 7
2011-10-26T08:59:00.000Z	bcbc2	okee	look for "Ubuntu", not "Wubi"
2011-10-26T09:00:00.000Z	okee		I see it in the menu, but when I select the ubuntu, I just get a purple screen and nothing else..  I don't know what it did, but it isn't good.  And I can't get the laptop to boot off of the ubuntu disk.  I went into the bios and everything looks ok.  I was thinking of shutting off the fast boot to see if it helps.
2011-10-26T09:00:00.000Z	okee	ubuntu	has never run since the install.
2011-10-26T09:01:00.000Z	okee		I don't recall.  STandby and I will retry it.
2011-10-26T09:02:00.000Z	okee		I think it did install.
2011-10-26T09:03:00.000Z	bcbc2		bug 864739
2011-10-26T09:03:00.000Z	okee		I am seeing a blinking yellow light next to the RJ47 capable, but it only blinked for about 5-10 seconds and now is out.
2011-10-26T09:04:00.000Z	okee		Doesn't look like the hard drive is doing anything.
2011-10-26T09:04:00.000Z	okee		Ubuntu has never booted up since the install.
2011-10-26T09:05:00.000Z	okee		Ubuntu has never booted up since the install.  I don't know what else to say.
2011-10-26T09:06:00.000Z	okee		The question is how do I get it off of here and get Ubuntu reinstalled?  Ubuntu should have been installed into its own partition at bootup, and not within windows.  The install was actually an accident.
2011-10-26T09:07:00.000Z	bcbc2	okee	according to bug 864739 you need to use the nomodeset boot option: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 To get rid of it look for "Ubuntu" in add/remove programs or run C:\ubuntu\uninstall-wubi.exe
