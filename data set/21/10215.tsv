2005-07-03T13:54:00.000Z	WMCoolmon		2 more questions tonight...
2005-07-03T13:54:00.000Z	WMCoolmon		1) should i care if an application will remove "ubuntu-desktop"?
2005-07-03T13:55:00.000Z	bob2	WMCoolmon	yes, it will make upgrading to breezy when it's released harder
2005-07-03T13:56:00.000Z	WMCoolmon	bob2	so keep evolution et al even though i may be using thunderbird instead?
2005-07-03T13:57:00.000Z	WMCoolmon	bob2	no, i've got ~19 GB to work with
2005-07-03T13:57:00.000Z	WMCoolmon	bob2	and if i run out of space there, 30 GB
2005-07-03T13:59:00.000Z	bob2	WMCoolmon	you don't build modules against the kernel source, you build them against the kernel headers
2005-07-03T13:59:00.000Z	bob2	WMCoolmon	sudo aptitude install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
2005-07-03T14:01:00.000Z	bob2	WMCoolmon	searching  for the package on http://packages.ubuntu.com/ will give you a download link
2005-07-27T11:59:00.000Z	bob2	WMCoolmon	you'll need to be a bit more specific
2005-07-27T12:00:00.000Z	bob2	WMCoolmon	what is?
2005-07-27T12:00:00.000Z	bob2	WMCoolmon	on hoary?
2005-07-27T12:00:00.000Z	bob2	WMCoolmon	with the default version of g++?
2005-07-27T12:02:00.000Z	bob2	WMCoolmon	paste the error from g++ to #flood
2005-07-27T12:03:00.000Z	bob2	WMCoolmon	you have wx2.5-headers installed?
2005-07-27T12:04:00.000Z	WMCoolmon	bob2	yeah
2005-07-27T12:06:00.000Z	WMCoolmon	bob2	http://fs2source.warpcore.org/out.txt
2005-07-27T12:07:00.000Z	bob2	WMCoolmon	http://lists.debian.org/debian-testing/2005/03/msg00109.html
2005-07-27T12:30:00.000Z	bob2	WMCoolmon	sounds like a missing include
2005-07-27T12:34:00.000Z	WMCoolmon	bob2	command line is (gcc helloworld.cpp -I "/usr/lib/wx/include/base-2.4/")
2005-09-18T11:09:00.000Z	bob2	WMCoolmon	clearly no one here knows; what did google say? nothing in the list archives?
