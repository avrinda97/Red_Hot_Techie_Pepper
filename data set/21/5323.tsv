2008-03-23T14:22:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn		I'd say
2008-03-23T14:23:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn		geez.. I'd suggest you look into ratpoison for a WM  lol
2008-03-23T14:23:00.000Z	arke	FourX4Luvn	well, ideally I'll get the other motherboard to work, that one is completely dead though
2008-03-23T14:24:00.000Z	arke	FourX4Luvn	this is somewhat of a temporary solution
2008-03-23T14:35:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	arke	Have you tried any resolutions even larger than 1680?
2008-03-23T14:36:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	arke	I'm just wondering if perhaps your card and/or driver don't support that large a resolution
2008-03-23T14:37:00.000Z	arke	FourX4Luvn	no, because my monitor doesn't support them
2008-03-23T14:37:00.000Z	arke	FourX4Luvn	well, the card is a radeon 9200 .... should support it, especially since the nvidia geforce2 worked (but only once and after alot of tweaking as well, for osme reason)
2008-03-23T14:38:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	arke	Ugh!  You replaced an nVidia card with an ATI when you're running Linux?!
2008-03-23T14:41:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	arke	Which drivers are you using?  The open or closed ones?
2008-03-23T14:49:00.000Z	arke	FourX4Luvn	sorry for the delay
2008-03-23T14:50:00.000Z	arke	FourX4Luvn	not sure, actually ... "ati" is the X name for it
2008-03-23T14:50:00.000Z	arke	FourX4Luvn	I went for the ATI because it's better than the nvidia (in a technical sense), but I had the problem with the nvidia as well (but it worked once, no idea how)
2008-03-23T14:51:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	arke	The ATI drivers are not NEARLY as good as nVidia's are for Linux support though.. that's the problem...  ati is the closed driver... you want to run 'radeon'.. It has better support
2008-03-23T14:52:00.000Z	arke	FourX4Luvn	how's 3D stuff with the open driver?
2008-03-23T14:53:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	arke	Supposedly better than the closed driver.  I haven't run ATI in years, so I can't speak from experience, but that's what I've read
2008-03-23T14:53:00.000Z	arke	FourX4Luvn	reason I ask is because I plan to run call of duty on wine at the LAN party next weekend :)
2008-03-23T14:54:00.000Z	arke	FourX4Luvn	anywya, I'll switch to the radeon driver in a few moments. I'm going to try finding the monitor refresh rates in the manual and giving them to X first.
2008-03-23T14:55:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	arke	Tis a good idea.  No guarantee what I said will work either.. Just that it has a slightly better chance of working
2008-03-23T15:01:00.000Z	arke	FourX4Luvn	just like chinese and japanese look similar to my eyes :)
