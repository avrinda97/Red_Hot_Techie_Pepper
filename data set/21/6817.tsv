2008-01-21T10:46:00.000Z	Nath_		Hi all, can anybody help me with a wireless problem?
2008-01-21T10:48:00.000Z	Nath_		My wireless is listed as "working out of the box" but I can't get ubuntu to even recognise that I have a wireless connection
2008-01-21T10:49:00.000Z	Nath_		on the ubuntu webiste it is listed there
2008-01-21T10:49:00.000Z	Nath_		belkin fd50...

2008-01-21T10:49:00.000Z	Nath_		card is F5D6050z
2008-01-21T10:50:00.000Z	Nath_		I didn't install anything
2008-01-21T10:51:00.000Z	Nath_		how do i install drivers
2008-01-21T10:52:00.000Z	Nath_		so what can I do
2008-01-21T10:52:00.000Z	Nath_		cause I can't install packages and the OS is kinda useless unless i get the wireless working
2008-01-21T10:53:00.000Z	ericrost	Nath_	do you have another running computer?
2008-01-21T10:53:00.000Z	ericrost	Nath_	then download the packages in your windows side
2008-01-21T10:53:00.000Z	ericrost	Nath_	burn them to cd and double click on them in ubuntu
2008-01-21T10:53:00.000Z	ericrost	Nath_	from packages.ubuntu.org
2008-01-21T10:54:00.000Z	ericrost	Nath_	yes, but you're just shooting to get the wifi working, correct? after that you'll have a connection
2008-01-21T10:55:00.000Z	ericrost	Nath_	all you should need are a few statically linked packages without many dependencies, find the solution on the forums while you're on your windows side if you can
2008-01-21T10:56:00.000Z	ericrost	Nath_	fyi, wifi is the WORST part of linux
2008-01-21T10:56:00.000Z	ericrost	Nath_	unfortunately for us, its the first you see, too :)
2008-01-21T10:56:00.000Z	ericrost	Nath_	trust me, for almost anything you'll do, its point, click, install
2008-01-21T10:57:00.000Z	ericrost	Nath_	pci is usually better, but I'm living with a usb for the moment
2008-01-21T10:58:00.000Z	ericrost	Nath_	si, intel es muy bueno for wireless
