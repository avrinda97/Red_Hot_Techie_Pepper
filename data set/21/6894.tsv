2007-01-06T09:12:00.000Z	lupine_85		you can replace with the real device files if you like
2007-01-06T09:13:00.000Z	lupine_85		it could be udf, or VCD, or all sorts
2007-01-06T09:15:00.000Z	lupine_85		man bchunk will go through the options with you
2007-01-06T09:15:00.000Z	lupine_85		it's pretty easy, especially since you actually have a .cue
2007-01-06T09:16:00.000Z	lupine_85		whenever I've used it, I've had to write my own :/
2007-01-06T09:17:00.000Z	lupine_85		cat <anyfile.cue>
2007-01-06T09:17:00.000Z	lupine_85		it's ~4 lines
2007-01-06T09:17:00.000Z	lupine_85		if you know what the .bin is meant to be, you can make good guesses as to what those lines should be
2007-01-06T09:17:00.000Z	lupine_85		I was talking about writing my own .cue for bchink to use
2007-01-06T09:18:00.000Z	xopher-	lupine_85	isnt there a way to mount bin files directly too? would save 'a lot' of time not needing to convert the file to iso first, if that's what you are trying to do
2007-01-06T09:19:00.000Z	lupine_85	xopher-	there isn't, AFAIK
2007-01-06T09:19:00.000Z	xopher-	lupine_85	Im sure Ive seen it somewhere *going hunting*
2007-01-06T09:21:00.000Z	xopher-	lupine_85	it's possible using cdemu: http://www.bigbold.com/snippets/posts/show/2699
2007-01-06T09:40:00.000Z	xopher-	lupine_85	there's also a script to create cue files for bin files missing them in the how to: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=276743 ;)
2007-01-06T09:52:00.000Z	lupine_85	xopher-	tar -xf autodetects as well :)
2007-01-06T09:53:00.000Z	xopher-	lupine_85	*kisses* ;p
2007-01-06T09:55:00.000Z	lupine_85	xopher-	RFC rand(MAXINT); has a specification for CoffeeOverIP
2007-01-06T10:08:00.000Z	lupine_85	xopher-	it could also be the (correct :D) /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build symlink
2007-01-06T10:08:00.000Z	xopher-	lupine_85	yeah
2007-01-06T10:33:00.000Z	xopher-	lupine_85	about the fd number error http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/09/19/bad-fd-number
