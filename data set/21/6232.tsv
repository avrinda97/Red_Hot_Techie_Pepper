2009-04-19T11:14:00.000Z	ziroday	perturbed	you need the alternate 8.10 cd
2009-04-19T11:15:00.000Z	ziroday	perturbed	plus, 9.04 is not released yet.
2009-04-19T11:16:00.000Z	ziroday	perturbed	no. You need to upgrade to 8.10 first, then to 9.04
2009-04-19T11:19:00.000Z	ziroday	perturbed	you cannot go from 8.04 to 9.04 directly
2009-04-19T11:20:00.000Z	ziroday	perturbed	correct
2009-04-19T11:20:00.000Z	ziroday	perturbed	9.04 is _not_ stable. Wait for it to be released
2009-04-19T11:20:00.000Z	ziroday	perturbed	yes
2009-04-19T11:24:00.000Z	ziroday	perturbed	this is the ubuntu channel. So obviously yes
