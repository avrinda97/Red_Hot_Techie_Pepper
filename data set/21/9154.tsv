2007-10-16T07:36:00.000Z	dot		when I open a mp3 file it says: error loading media
2007-10-16T07:36:00.000Z	LjL	dot	install libxine1-ffmpeg
2007-10-16T07:37:00.000Z	dot	LjL	well it won't play me pm3 files
2007-10-16T07:38:00.000Z	LjL	dot	but libxine1-ffmpeg installed successfully?
2007-10-16T07:38:00.000Z	dot	LjL	terminal said: libxine1-ffmpeg is already the newest version and 0 upgraded + newly installed 0 to remove and 0 upgraded
2007-10-16T07:40:00.000Z	LjL	dot	does it only say "Error loading media"? that error is usually followed by another explanation message
2007-10-16T07:40:00.000Z	dot	LjL	can you help?
2007-10-16T07:41:00.000Z	dot	LjL	Error Loading Media No suitable demux plugin. This often means that the file format is not supported.
2007-10-16T07:41:00.000Z	LjL	dot	are you on Feisty?
2007-10-16T07:42:00.000Z	dot	LjL	yes
2007-10-16T07:43:00.000Z	dot	LjL	yes im on feisty
2007-10-16T07:46:00.000Z	LjL	dot	i'm *googling*. breathing on my neck won't help.
2007-10-16T07:47:00.000Z	dot	LjL	ook thanks for helping
2007-10-16T07:47:00.000Z	LjL	dot	try closing amarok, then    mv ~/.xine ~/.xine-backup       , then opening amarok again
2007-10-16T07:48:00.000Z	LjL	dot	i said      mv ~/.xine/ ~/.xine-backup     not     mv ~/.xine/ ~/.xine/-backup
2007-10-16T07:51:00.000Z	dot	LjL	now its working, thank you
2007-10-16T07:51:00.000Z	LjL	dot	get your ~/.xine directory out of the way. that's a directory that contains configuration files for Xine, the media engine that amarok uses to play stuff. google said that removing that directory solved that problem for other people.
2007-10-16T07:52:00.000Z	dot	LjL	is it out of the way now?
2007-10-16T07:52:00.000Z	LjL	dot	yes, although i've made you *move* it to somewhere else rather then *deleting* it, just in case. you can probably delete .xine-backup now if you want, though (but it'll just save you a couple of bytes on the disk)
2007-10-16T07:53:00.000Z	dot	LjL	thanks you are a real ubuntu god
