2005-08-28T06:17:00.000Z	Jowi		what is it with linux firefox? when some pages load it just hangs for 5-10 seconds...
2005-08-28T06:17:00.000Z	kemik	Jowi	 could be parsing the page
2005-08-28T06:18:00.000Z	Jowi	kemik	yeah, probably. no other tabs can be accessed in the meantime.
2005-08-28T08:45:00.000Z	Jowi	kemik	what do you mean by talking?
2005-08-28T08:45:00.000Z	kemik	Jowi	 ping/ssh etc etc ;)
2005-08-28T08:46:00.000Z	kemik	Jowi	 both the 192.168.2.x and 192.168.1.y networks can use the internet through the routerbox, but they just cannot access eachother
2005-08-28T08:49:00.000Z	Jowi	kemik	let me get this straight. you have connected two networks to the same router.  the router gives IP to network 1 automaticly through dhcp and the other one is static that uses the router as a gateway?
2005-08-28T08:50:00.000Z	kemik	Jowi	 yeah that's about it ;) (the ...162.2.x is dhcp and 1 is static... ) and the router is actually a debian-serverinstall
2005-08-28T08:53:00.000Z	kemik	Jowi	 and ideas about my network nightmare? ;)
2005-08-28T08:53:00.000Z	Jowi	kemik	i am thinking
2005-08-28T08:56:00.000Z	Jowi	kemik	i would guess that you need to set up a static route. i *think* the command goes something like : route add -host 192.168.2.x gw 192.168.1.x
2005-08-28T08:56:00.000Z	Jowi	kemik	hang on, i saw a good url somewhere
2005-08-28T08:56:00.000Z	kemik	Jowi	 mmh, i tried setting up a route but the way i did it didnt work.. i'll hold ;)
2005-08-28T08:58:00.000Z	Jowi	kemik	did you try the "net" option as well? route add -net 192.168.2.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.1.10
2005-08-28T08:58:00.000Z	Jowi	kemik	ah, here it is: http://www.aboutdebian.com/network.htm explains static routing as well
2005-08-28T08:59:00.000Z	kemik	Jowi	 ty, will look into that later =)
2005-08-28T08:59:00.000Z	Jowi	kemik	np
2005-09-01T05:08:00.000Z	Jowi	kemik	lol
2005-09-28T15:39:00.000Z	kemik	Jowi	 "sortof"? :P
2005-09-28T15:40:00.000Z	Jowi	kemik	yeah. never planned it. i'm actually against marriages. funny how life develops.
2005-10-01T09:09:00.000Z	Jowi	kemik	no use deleting the tmp all together ;)
