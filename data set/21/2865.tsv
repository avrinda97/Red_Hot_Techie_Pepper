2009-05-30T08:20:00.000Z	hoohaah		is it worth trying to setup wine for office apps, or should i just do a kvm install of xp and install office there?
2009-05-30T08:21:00.000Z	hoohaah		plus, I have several statistics packages that can only work on excel
2009-05-30T08:22:00.000Z	hoohaah		can you provide a link to a howto?
2009-05-30T08:22:00.000Z	hoohaah		noice
2009-05-30T08:24:00.000Z	hoohaah		I don't want to spend any more money than I already have for an office app
2009-05-30T08:24:00.000Z	hoohaah		2007 at student discount is still fairly expensive
2009-05-30T08:26:00.000Z	fryguy	hoohaah	the problem is that ati initializes the sound infrastructure first, which causes the onboard realtek card to not work.
2009-05-30T08:26:00.000Z	fryguy	hoohaah	the ATI hdmi driver grabs audio in a weird way
2009-05-30T08:26:00.000Z	hoohaah	fryguy	you can specify (in alsa) a different default audio device
2009-05-30T08:26:00.000Z	hoohaah	fryguy	ati wouldn't make the realtek card 'not work'
2009-05-30T08:26:00.000Z	fryguy	hoohaah	you can, by changing alsa configuration, or you can just disable the ATI driver.  like i said, he needs to google for details
2009-05-30T08:26:00.000Z	fryguy	hoohaah	it does
2009-05-30T08:27:00.000Z	fryguy	hoohaah	you apparently haven't looked at the ATI HDMI driver and how it works
2009-05-30T08:27:00.000Z	fryguy	hoohaah	this is a known, documented issue
2009-05-30T08:27:00.000Z	hoohaah	fryguy	no i haven't seen the source, but I have the same setup: ati gfx card and realtek onboard
2009-05-30T08:27:00.000Z	hoohaah	fryguy	weird, then I guess my system is an exception
2009-05-30T08:28:00.000Z	fryguy	hoohaah	only happens on machines that have an ATI HDMI audio driver (not all ATI cards expose this, the machine I'm currently on does not)
2009-05-30T08:29:00.000Z	hoohaah	fryguy	my hd card does
2009-05-30T08:35:00.000Z	fryguy	hoohaah	it does
2009-05-30T08:38:00.000Z	fryguy	hoohaah	it's a driver, not a codec
2009-05-30T08:52:00.000Z	hoohaah	fryguy	good luck. If it's anything to do with a sound daemon on top of alsa, I haven't the foggiest
