2012-04-28T12:32:00.000Z	_xan_	ubuntu	please list the choices
2012-04-28T12:33:00.000Z	_xan_	ubuntu	when you select HDD describe what happens
2012-04-28T12:35:00.000Z	_xan_	ubuntu	Can you try booting on a live cd and see if you can mount the partitions to make sure they are still readable?
2012-04-28T12:36:00.000Z	_xan_	ubuntu	are you able to mount the other partitions on your drive and read data?
2012-04-28T12:37:00.000Z	_xan_	ubuntu	try these instructions https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
2012-04-28T12:39:00.000Z	_xan_	ubuntu	on the page I linked it says install and run Boot-Repair
2012-04-28T12:40:00.000Z	_xan_	ubuntu	are you able to do this?
2012-04-28T12:41:00.000Z	_xan_	ubuntu	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
2012-04-28T12:42:00.000Z	_xan_	ubuntu	anytime
2012-04-28T13:33:00.000Z	_xan_	ubuntu	if that's the case then I would remove all data from the drive, repartition, reformat, and reinstall
2012-04-28T13:34:00.000Z	_xan_	ubuntu	probably the quickest solution
2012-04-28T13:38:00.000Z	_xan_	ubuntu	what if your drive crashed?  you would just lose all the data?
