2005-10-08T10:33:00.000Z	nalioth	kennethlove	NFS on OSX is a little different than on other unixes, b/c of netinfo
2005-10-08T10:33:00.000Z	kennethlove	nalioth	yeah, i think i've heard that before.
2005-10-08T11:33:00.000Z	nalioth	kennethlove	did you get nfsmanager from bresink.de?
2005-10-08T11:33:00.000Z	kennethlove	nalioth	yeah.
2005-10-08T11:41:00.000Z	kennethlove	nalioth	so is nfs manager your only bit of advice?
2005-10-08T11:42:00.000Z	nalioth	kennethlove	with OSX, yes. netinfo mangler is not very unix standard
2005-10-08T11:42:00.000Z	kennethlove	nalioth	yeah, but why don't any of the shares show up on it?
2005-10-08T11:43:00.000Z	nalioth	kennethlove	i have no clue. i'm not up on NFS usage, just it's purview
2005-10-08T11:43:00.000Z	kennethlove	nalioth	ah. alright, thanks.
