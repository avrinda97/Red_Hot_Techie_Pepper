2005-11-20T14:08:00.000Z	lillpelle		Rubin and nalioth: hm, it still wants to upgrade. the old package is called beep-media-player-0.9.7.1+cvs... and the new one is beep-media-player-0.9.7.1-1, so I wrote Pin: version 0.9.7.1-1*, any ideas?
2005-11-20T14:08:00.000Z	nalioth	lillpelle	do you use synaptic?
2005-11-20T14:09:00.000Z	lillpelle	nalioth	right now I am using console: aptitude update and aptitude upgrade
2005-11-20T14:09:00.000Z	nalioth	lillpelle	it's easy in synaptic, i'm having pinning troubles myself atm
2005-11-20T14:10:00.000Z	nalioth	lillpelle	there is a bug that may affect YOU if you have a preferences file
2005-11-20T14:10:00.000Z	lillpelle	nalioth	yes, I put it in the /etc/apt/preferences... Ok, I try to do it in synaptic instead...
2005-11-20T14:11:00.000Z	nalioth	lillpelle	save your preferences file and see if you can update and upgrade
2005-11-20T14:11:00.000Z	nalioth	lillpelle	let us know waht happens
2005-11-20T14:12:00.000Z	lillpelle	nalioth	hm, but that is what I had, a preferences file with two lines: "Package: beep-media-player" an "Pin: version 0.9.7.1-1*" (OK, I am a bit confused)
2005-11-20T14:13:00.000Z	nalioth	lillpelle	that sounds correct. save it and see if you can update and upgrade
2005-11-20T14:14:00.000Z	lillpelle	nalioth	hm, when I opened synaptic it complained about no priority for the pin,so maybe I should add that (even though it says somewhere it is not needed)
2005-11-20T14:14:00.000Z	nalioth	lillpelle	thought you used aptitude.
2005-11-20T14:15:00.000Z	nalioth	lillpelle	we need to stick to a front end for this bug check, please, and the front end should be aptitude or apt-get
2005-11-20T14:15:00.000Z	lillpelle	nalioth	ah, adding a Pin-Priority in /etc/apt/preferences did it! :)
2005-11-20T14:15:00.000Z	nalioth	lillpelle	please save it and update and upgrade
2005-11-20T14:15:00.000Z	lillpelle	nalioth	so now it works with aptitude, when Pin-Priority is set
2005-11-20T14:16:00.000Z	nalioth	lillpelle	upgrading works fine? no weird error msgs?
2005-11-20T14:17:00.000Z	lillpelle	nalioth	yes, both update and upgrade runs without problems (and upgrade without wanting to "upgrade" to the older cvs package)
2005-11-20T14:17:00.000Z	nalioth	lillpelle	good to hear! i've got a bug associated with my pinning, and i can't figure it out
2005-11-20T14:19:00.000Z	nalioth	lillpelle	share the love, help someone else
2005-11-20T14:20:00.000Z	lillpelle	nalioth	yes, I should (I am usually helping people in #math and #latex, with linux I am not so good myself, but maybe one can help someone) :)
