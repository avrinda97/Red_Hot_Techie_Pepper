2008-05-04T12:11:00.000Z	benovic		narf, i get my screen doubled
2008-05-04T12:13:00.000Z	benovic		what can that be? http://img385.imageshack.us/my.php?image=bildschirmfotoxc1.png
2008-05-04T12:14:00.000Z	fde	benovic	it is Pidgin.
2008-05-04T12:14:00.000Z	benovic	fde	look upper right corner
2008-05-04T12:15:00.000Z	benovic	fde	and bar
2008-05-04T12:15:00.000Z	fde	benovic	ahh... that is a bug in the 'intel' driver I think...
2008-05-04T12:15:00.000Z	benovic	fde	 its intel, right
2008-05-04T12:16:00.000Z	fde	benovic	It is due to it giving you a smaller virtual monitor resolution than actual resolution...
2008-05-04T12:16:00.000Z	benovic	fde	 i already installed 915resolution and RUandR ... still doesnt work
2008-05-04T12:18:00.000Z	fde	benovic	sorry https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
2008-05-04T12:27:00.000Z	benovic	fde	I have the newest intel drivers, no help here... my xorg.conf looks like it hasn't detected anything: http://pastebin.com/m454c24a5
2008-05-04T12:28:00.000Z	fde	benovic	yeah... add those things rather than have it try to auto-detect... obviously the auto-detection is failing for you  ;)
2008-05-04T12:28:00.000Z	benovic	fde	 and the built in display resolution wizard is displaying both screens over another
2008-05-04T12:29:00.000Z	fde	benovic	ok... do what that page explains please.
2008-05-04T12:29:00.000Z	benovic	fde	 i dont really want to mess around with xorg.conf every time i attach an external monitor :(
2008-05-04T12:30:00.000Z	benovic	fde	well, i'll di anyway
2008-05-04T12:30:00.000Z	fde	benovic	It has nothing to do with monitor being used, fwiw
2008-05-04T12:31:00.000Z	fde	benovic	if you want a guided way, you can try 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg' and explicitly define a resolution.
2008-05-04T12:32:00.000Z	fde	benovic	moon`: If you don't know the right setting, just hit enter, for the questions that confuse you
2008-05-04T12:34:00.000Z	fde	benovic	you too, you want -plow if you do the dpkg-reconfigure command I said... I got the priority settings back to front
2008-05-04T12:35:00.000Z	fde	benovic	In your case though, it's harder if you've edited the file by hand already.
