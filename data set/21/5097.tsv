2008-01-03T04:09:00.000Z	sayers		I have a cron tab to >> stuff to a file however it ends up at the bottom, how would I get it to the top?
2008-01-03T04:10:00.000Z	atomdog2003	sayers	mv the original stuff to another file (mv) write with a single > and then write the moved file back using >>
2008-01-03T04:11:00.000Z	sayers	atomdog2003	That makes sense but an example would help a lot.
2008-01-03T04:11:00.000Z	sayers	atomdog2003	*/10 * * * * sensors -f | grep "CPU Temp" >> www/heat && uptime >> www/heat &&  echo >> www/heat && echo >> www/heat is my current cron tab
2008-01-03T04:11:00.000Z	atomdog2003	sayers	so, say the file you want pre-pend stuff to a file called file.txt:   mv file.txt tmp.txt ; output > file.txt ; cat tmp.txt >> file.txt
2008-01-03T04:12:00.000Z	atomdog2003	sayers	in your case it looks like the filename is www/heat
2008-01-03T04:13:00.000Z	sayers	atomdog2003	so with another cron tab do mv heat ~/tmp ; output > www/heat ; cat ~/tmp >> www/heat
2008-01-03T04:13:00.000Z	atomdog2003	sayers	I would just add that step to the command
2008-01-03T04:13:00.000Z	sayers	atomdog2003	Hm, well that's where I don't know how.
2008-01-03T04:20:00.000Z	atomdog2003	sayers	sensors -f | grep "CPU Temp" > tmp.txt ; uptime >> tmp.txt ; echo >> tmp.txt ; echo >> tmp.txt ; mv www/heat tmp2.txt ; cat tmp.txt > www/heat ; cat tmp2.txt >> www/heat
2008-01-03T04:21:00.000Z	sayers	atomdog2003	sadly above my head :)
2008-01-03T04:22:00.000Z	atomdog2003	sayers	cat is a program that dumps the contents of a file to stdout
2008-01-03T04:22:00.000Z	atomdog2003	sayers	did you write that cron job?
2008-01-03T04:22:00.000Z	sayers	atomdog2003	yes I just wrote it
2008-01-03T04:23:00.000Z	atomdog2003	sayers	then you know that you are writing the output from the program "sensors" to a file named www/heat
2008-01-03T04:23:00.000Z	atomdog2003	sayers	I guess that file is availble thru http
2008-01-03T04:24:00.000Z	sayers	atomdog2003	sjsayers.com/heat it will be at
2008-01-03T04:25:00.000Z	atomdog2003	sayers	to append to the top instead of the bottum, just write the current contents to another file, then write the sensor output to that file as usual, then append the original contents back onto the file
2008-01-03T04:25:00.000Z	sayers	atomdog2003	ah, sorta makes sense now, copy all the stuff to another file and then put the new at the top and copy over
2008-01-03T04:26:00.000Z	atomdog2003	sayers	right
2008-01-03T04:26:00.000Z	atomdog2003	sayers	I used "cat" to write the contents of a file to another
