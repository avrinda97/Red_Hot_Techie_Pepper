2007-12-04T18:39:00.000Z	vincenz		Hello, I am having some issues.  See I had the fglrx custom driver installed, but Direct Rendering said 'no' and there was some issue with DRI. I tried to follow various tutorials on the ubuntu support pages, but now my driver is MESA, and no matter what I do, it remains MESA.  Could anyone help please?

2007-12-04T18:51:00.000Z	vincenz	wols	one reason this could be due to is that my Hd has some faults recently, and it purged some files.  Would it be possible to refresh my entire package-system?
