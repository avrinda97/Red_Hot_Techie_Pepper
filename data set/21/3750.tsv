2008-10-02T14:08:00.000Z	LonelyRacer		hello how to enable WPA protected wireless?
2008-10-02T14:08:00.000Z	maco	LonelyRacer	that's a router question
2008-10-02T15:42:00.000Z	maco	LonelyRacer	see them where?
2008-10-02T15:42:00.000Z	LonelyRacer	maco	at the network manager showing wep only
2008-10-02T15:43:00.000Z	maco	LonelyRacer	it usually shows whatever the network you're trying to connect to is configured for
2008-10-02T15:44:00.000Z	LonelyRacer	maco	its showing my network and when connected it ask for pasword but wep not wpa
2008-10-02T15:45:00.000Z	maco	LonelyRacer	sounds like your network is configured for WEP then
2008-10-02T15:45:00.000Z	maco	LonelyRacer	other possibility is that your wireless drivers are crap
2008-10-02T15:45:00.000Z	LonelyRacer	maco	how to update the wireless then?
2008-10-02T15:46:00.000Z	maco	LonelyRacer	uh, i dont think its something updating has anything to do with
2008-10-02T15:47:00.000Z	maco	LonelyRacer	unless by update you mean "with what wireless card should i replace my current one?"
2008-10-02T15:47:00.000Z	maco	LonelyRacer	what do you currently have?
2008-10-02T15:47:00.000Z	maco	LonelyRacer	if you're using ndiswrapper to make it work, wirelss issues are unsurprising
2008-10-02T15:48:00.000Z	LonelyRacer	maco	its on my laptop dunno what version. its toshiba a10 laptop old laptop
2008-10-02T15:51:00.000Z	LonelyRacer	maco	any idea how to fix my problems?
2008-10-02T15:51:00.000Z	maco	LonelyRacer	you're gonna have to put "lspci" in the terminal then look through it's output for something about LAN and tell me what that line says
2008-10-02T15:54:00.000Z	LonelyRacer	maco	ethernet controler: Intel Corp 82801db pro/100 VE
2008-10-02T15:55:00.000Z	maco	LonelyRacer	um, there should be one more. that looks like wired net
2008-10-02T15:56:00.000Z	LonelyRacer	maco	im using my desktop now. my laptop dont have any connection so i just type what i see here ethernet controller
2008-10-02T15:57:00.000Z	maco	LonelyRacer	there should be one for wired and one for wireless though
