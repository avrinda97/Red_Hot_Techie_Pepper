2008-03-20T06:53:00.000Z	jetscreamer	Azodon	it isn't using it, no need
2008-03-20T06:54:00.000Z	jetscreamer	Azodon	do swapon -s
2008-03-20T06:54:00.000Z	jetscreamer	Azodon	mine gets not used also
2008-03-20T06:54:00.000Z	Azodon		ok, but the system monitor says 0 of 0 being used. ok mabey ,no need
2008-03-20T06:55:00.000Z	jetscreamer		swapon -s will tell you if it's activated
2008-03-20T06:55:00.000Z	Azodon		Swap:            0          0          0
2008-03-20T06:55:00.000Z	jetscreamer		'mounts' all
2008-03-20T06:55:00.000Z	jetscreamer		even thought it's not mounting i guess
2008-03-20T06:55:00.000Z	Azodon		 swapon -a
2008-03-20T06:55:00.000Z	Azodon		swapon: cannot canonicalize /dev/disk/by-uuid/eba9b7b6-6262-406c-a2e0-e947b430fdc3: No such file or directory
2008-03-20T06:55:00.000Z	Azodon		swapon: cannot stat /dev/disk/by-uuid/eba9b7b6-6262-406c-a2e0-e947b430fdc3: No such file or directory
2008-03-20T06:56:00.000Z	jetscreamer	Azodon	don't worry about that, do swapon -s
2008-03-20T06:57:00.000Z	Azodon		it is not in fstab
2008-03-20T06:57:00.000Z	jetscreamer		looks like it is in fstab
2008-03-20T06:57:00.000Z	jetscreamer		but uses uuid
2008-03-20T06:57:00.000Z	Azodon	jetscreamer	 swapon -s
2008-03-20T06:57:00.000Z	Azodon		Filename                                Type            Size    Used    Priority
2008-03-20T06:58:00.000Z	jetscreamer	Azodon	ok easy to fix
2008-03-20T06:58:00.000Z	jetscreamer		it's listed by uuid in your fstab apparently and all you have to do is comment it out and copy the line but change the new line to /dev/sdb2 or whichever
2008-03-20T06:59:00.000Z	jetscreamer	Azodon	or, you could mkswap -v1 /dev/whatever and change the uuid to the correct one
