2008-05-18T21:11:00.000Z	adaran	goldsniper	why's that?
2008-05-18T21:12:00.000Z	goldsniper	adaran	: how to connect him and tell him to bug off?
2008-05-18T21:12:00.000Z	adaran	goldsniper	switch off off the router
2008-05-18T21:12:00.000Z	adaran	goldsniper	switch it back on, connect to the webinterface, enable wifi encryption
2008-05-18T21:13:00.000Z	goldsniper	adaran	i did enabled the wifi encription alraedy
2008-05-18T21:13:00.000Z	adaran	goldsniper	WEP is not encryption
2008-05-18T21:13:00.000Z	adaran	goldsniper	usually, it takes then less then 10 minutes to crack it
2008-05-18T21:14:00.000Z	goldsniper	adaran	okay.. i like to try something else... i know this someone is my neighbour, so i want to frighten/surprised him by sending him a message , maybe popup on his pc? i know his using winxp....
2008-05-18T21:14:00.000Z	adaran	goldsniper	i'd refrain from that.
2008-05-18T21:15:00.000Z	adaran	goldsniper	if he's clever enough to break into your WEP-secured network, you're most likely not going to be able to scare him easily
2008-05-18T21:15:00.000Z	adaran	goldsniper	and what makes you think that someone has "broken into" your network?
2008-05-18T21:16:00.000Z	goldsniper	adaran	maybe i just want to send him a message that he can use my internet connection but have to share the bills?
2008-05-18T21:17:00.000Z	adaran	goldsniper	well first give me a reason why you're thinking that that is the case, then, why not just go over and ask/talk to him?
2008-05-18T21:18:00.000Z	goldsniper	adaran	where can i learnt how to send message to my wireless lan , broadcast maybe?
2008-05-18T21:18:00.000Z	adaran	goldsniper	you're not listening to what i'm saying and i'm not continuing this conversation =/
2008-05-18T21:19:00.000Z	goldsniper	adaran	sorry ... so i cant learnt that... its okay
