2011-12-07T13:27:00.000Z	truepurple		How does one save under nano?
2011-12-07T13:27:00.000Z	keithzg	truepurple	Ctrl-X, it'll prompt you, or Ctrl-O I believe saves without exiting.
2011-12-07T13:28:00.000Z	truepurple	keithzg	I choose to exit, it asks if I want to save, I type y, it goes back to the file and does not save
2011-12-07T13:29:00.000Z	keithzg	truepurple	are you sure you have permission to edit the file? If you're trying to edit something in /etc/, for example, you'll likely have to be running it with "sudo nano /etc/path/to/file"
2011-12-07T13:34:00.000Z	truepurple	keithzg	my computer shut down, so got a idea how I can save?
2011-12-07T13:41:00.000Z	truepurple	keithzg	oopsy, that was my mistake
2011-12-07T14:10:00.000Z	keithzg	truepurple	all those instructions are telling you to do is remove flash, enable the partner repo, and then install the "adobe-flashplugin" package, which is the Adobe Flash entry in the Software Center.
2011-12-07T14:11:00.000Z	truepurple	keithzg	how is that different from just removing flash then installing adobe flash directly?
2011-12-07T14:12:00.000Z	keithzg	truepurple	err, probably not any different, but what do you mean by "directly"?
2011-12-07T14:16:00.000Z	truepurple	keithzg	I mean going to the adobe flash site and using their download to install
2011-12-07T14:18:00.000Z	keithzg	truepurple	do they provide a .deb file? Otherwise, it's no different at the moment, but differs in that the system will keep track of the package and install newer versions if/when they become available in the repositories.
2011-12-07T14:18:00.000Z	keithzg	truepurple	plus, then it's far easier to install and uninstall. Always less messy to have the package manager keep track of things.
2011-12-07T14:19:00.000Z	truepurple	keithzg	the download adds a link to software center to install, I don't know if it adds a .deb file or not
2011-12-07T14:21:00.000Z	keithzg	truepurple	I just checked, yeah, all it does in theory is add the partner repo to the repository lists, so it's no different than adding the lines to /etc/apt/sources.list yourself.
2011-12-07T14:22:00.000Z	truepurple	keithzg	does that mean it updates?
2011-12-07T14:22:00.000Z	keithzg	truepurple	Yeah, as long as Adobe deigns to push the newer versions into the repository.
2011-12-07T14:23:00.000Z	truepurple	keithzg	so what I did in the instructions I was given was no different then using the file from adobe to install in the software center?
2011-12-07T14:24:00.000Z	keithzg	truepurple	as far as I can tell, yeah, no difference at all.
2011-12-07T14:26:00.000Z	truepurple	keithzg	do I need to shut down all flash before installing flash?
2011-12-07T14:30:00.000Z	keithzg	truepurple	naw, whatever flash is running may keep running, but the fact that it's open won't matter one way or another for replacing the actual install.
2011-12-07T14:50:00.000Z	truepurple	keithzg	well it didn't fix the flash updating graphics issue after all that
