2012-09-23T13:38:00.000Z	eliteprodigy		trying to install ubuntu 12.4 LTS 64 bit on an HP Pavilion with 8Gb DDR3 RAM, AMD Athalon II 650 3.2Ghz but the screen keeps "Sleeping" during install but will not wake.
2012-09-23T13:39:00.000Z	eliteprodigy		I set the screen sleep timer to never during install through system settings on the live disc.
2012-09-23T13:40:00.000Z	enyc	eliteprodigy	im not gfamilair with that issue.  maybe you could get the text/alternate  intall ?
2012-09-23T13:41:00.000Z	eliteprodigy	enyc	the problem continues into running the system, enyc
2012-09-23T13:42:00.000Z	enyc	eliteprodigy	hrrm  i wonder if it is powermgmt related
2012-09-23T13:42:00.000Z	eliteprodigy		I'm dual-loading ubuntu/win7 no probs in 7
2012-09-23T13:42:00.000Z	eliteprodigy		I have a similar issue with Fedora.
2012-09-23T13:42:00.000Z	enyc	eliteprodigy	bios-upgrade, i have found to fix some weird things like that ... it could be anything =(
2012-09-23T13:43:00.000Z	eliteprodigy		Fedora installs fine (since it doesn't last long enough to black the screen) but when it sleeps the screen won't come on.

2012-09-23T13:43:00.000Z	eliteprodigy		However, when I manually suspend, it comes right back.
2012-09-23T13:43:00.000Z	eliteprodigy		how does one go about updating a bios?
2012-09-23T13:44:00.000Z	enyc	eliteprodigy	my instinct would be to try updated bios, if available,  out of interest.  i've had ACPI related nonsense before...
2012-09-23T13:44:00.000Z	eliteprodigy		This machine is fairly new <1yr, and I've never done that.
2012-09-23T13:44:00.000Z	enyc	eliteprodigy	but it could equally be nothing to do with that =)
2012-09-23T13:44:00.000Z	enyc	eliteprodigy	usually HP etc. will give you a tool that does it
2012-09-23T13:44:00.000Z	enyc	eliteprodigy	sometimes via bootdisk, sometimes via windows binary, etc.
2012-09-23T13:44:00.000Z	enyc	eliteprodigy	traditionally it was done with dos boot disk but many manufacturers have moved to mini iso images etc
2012-09-23T13:45:00.000Z	enyc	eliteprodigy	it can be graphics card related and allsorts i dont have a specific answer =)
2012-09-23T13:45:00.000Z	eliteprodigy		I'm assuming it's somewhere is system restore or windows or something because I didn't get any discs, all hidden drive images.
