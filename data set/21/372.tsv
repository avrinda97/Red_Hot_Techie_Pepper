2012-02-01T22:15:00.000Z	KayGridley		afternoon all
2012-02-01T22:16:00.000Z	KayGridley		anyone able to help getting an ubuntu server to talk to the rest of the network it's sitting as part of please?
2012-02-01T22:18:00.000Z	KayGridley		my default gateway is unreachable if anyone can help
2012-02-01T22:19:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	KayGridley	 how are you online? via the gateway?
2012-02-01T22:20:00.000Z	KayGridley	MonkeyDust	online via a windows netbook running wireless onto the same network as the server, so the gateway is working
2012-02-01T22:22:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	KayGridley	 so the gateway *is* reachabe, but not from your ubuntu pc? is it wifi or with cable?
2012-02-01T22:22:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	KayGridley	 can you ping the gateway from your ubuntu pc?
2012-02-01T22:23:00.000Z	KayGridley	MonkeyDust	no I get "Network is unreachable"
2012-02-01T22:24:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	KayGridley	 does the ubuntu pc have a static ip address or dynamic (dhcp)?
2012-02-01T22:24:00.000Z	KayGridley	MonkeyDust	I've set it to static as it's part of a rack of other servers
2012-02-01T22:25:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	KayGridley	 has it worked before? is the network correct, in /etc/network/interfaces ?
2012-02-01T22:26:00.000Z	KayGridley	MonkeyDust	no, this is the first time its been installed as an ubuntu server, previous to this week it was a defunct spare windows server that ws powered down
2012-02-01T22:27:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	KayGridley	 what's the outcome of dig|grep SERVER ?
2012-02-01T22:27:00.000Z	KayGridley	MonkeyDust	what does that do?
2012-02-01T22:27:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	KayGridley	 to know your gateway's address
2012-02-01T22:28:00.000Z	KayGridley	MonkeyDust	it puts a # between 2 and 53
2012-02-01T22:28:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	KayGridley	 what's the complete line?
2012-02-01T22:29:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	KayGridley	 the gateway's address is 100.104.0.2
2012-02-01T22:31:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	KayGridley	 what's the outcome of grep name  /etc/resolv.conf ?
2012-02-01T22:35:00.000Z	KayGridley	MonkeyDust	was that to me?
2012-02-01T22:36:00.000Z	KayGridley	MonkeyDust	and llutz thnx for the help, got to run, probably back tomorrow!
