2011-01-06T10:05:00.000Z	liny_man	Danny78	type "moouunt" in the command prompt to see the location of all mounted systems, including you cd drive.
2011-01-06T10:07:00.000Z	liny_man	Danny78	like reformat it? or unmount it?
2011-01-06T10:10:00.000Z	liny_man	Danny78	try "Brasero" from the applications menu. its the default program for stuff like this. i dont know if it reformats CDs though.
2011-01-06T10:14:00.000Z	liny_man	Danny78	im using a pda to connect, and was unable to catch your question. what was it?
2011-01-06T10:15:00.000Z	liny_man	Danny78	*Darn* small linux?
2011-01-06T10:21:00.000Z	liny_man	Danny78	whats wrong with Brasero?
2011-01-06T10:23:00.000Z	liny_man	Danny78	whats the message shown when you try to reformat it?
2011-01-06T10:27:00.000Z	liny_man	Danny78	yes try burning it on the newer machine, and keep the burning speed low, so it will work better in old machines. as a side note, one of my older dik readers couldn't read a cd-rw disk.
2011-01-06T10:27:00.000Z	liny_man	Danny78	always.
2011-01-06T10:36:00.000Z	liny_man	Danny78	the iso, when extracted and burned to a cd is bootable. i have done it.
2011-01-06T10:37:00.000Z	Danny78	liny_man	 so it doesn't matter which I download?
2011-01-06T10:38:00.000Z	liny_man	Danny78	the cd version? i would get the cd version if possible. i dont remember how i did it before.
2011-01-06T10:38:00.000Z	Danny78	liny_man	 ok, I'll give it a try
2011-01-06T10:39:00.000Z	liny_man	Danny78	good luck! :p
2011-01-06T10:39:00.000Z	Danny78	liny_man	 well, it's only bonus if I get this old man of a box back to life
2011-01-06T10:50:00.000Z	liny_man	Danny78	it should be fine.
2011-01-06T10:58:00.000Z	Danny78	liny_man	 It didn't work...  same freeze on bootup after saying there's a bootable cd in the drive...
2011-01-06T10:58:00.000Z	liny_man	Danny78	did you select dsl from th bootup sequence?
2011-01-06T10:59:00.000Z	Danny78	liny_man	 I tried slitaz...  now I'm burning DSL
2011-01-06T11:00:00.000Z	liny_man	Danny78	i never even heard of slitaz, so i am unable to help you there.
2011-01-06T11:00:00.000Z	Danny78	liny_man	 well, we'll see if DSL does the trick
