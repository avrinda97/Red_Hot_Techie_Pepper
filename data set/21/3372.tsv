2009-09-24T08:12:00.000Z	Strife89		Ugh, this is unfortunate. I accidentally unchecked Enable Networking, but when I rechecked it my Wi-Fi wouldn't connect. I flipped off and on the manual switch, and now Ubuntu won't detect the interface at all. Now what?

2009-09-24T08:15:00.000Z	felixsulla	Strife89	You can try sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart  .. I have the same problem you are talking about, but I lose internet until I reboot :/
2009-09-24T08:19:00.000Z	Strife89	felixsulla	That and rebooting didn't help. :/
2009-09-24T08:19:00.000Z	felixsulla	Strife89	You aren't by chance on a laptop that has a switch that disables wireless that's been flipped to off..?
2009-09-24T08:20:00.000Z	Strife89	felixsulla	It has a swith, but I double-checked, it's on.
2009-09-24T08:21:00.000Z	felixsulla	Strife89	If you go to edit connections, and under Wireless tab is your router there?
2009-09-24T08:22:00.000Z	Strife89	felixsulla	Yes.
2009-09-24T08:22:00.000Z	felixsulla	Strife89	What does ifconfig in terminal show?
2009-09-24T08:23:00.000Z	Strife89	felixsulla	Only eth0 and lo. Odd, wlan0 should be there....
2009-09-24T08:23:00.000Z	felixsulla	Strife89	Agreed, I think Ubuntu has dumbed your ethernet card?
2009-09-24T08:24:00.000Z	Strife89	felixsulla	Is a reinstall in order?
2009-09-24T08:24:00.000Z	felixsulla	Strife89	I dont think you should have to do that.. there is probably a way to get it to recognize your wireless again.
2009-09-24T08:26:00.000Z	Strife89	felixsulla	Question is ... what?
2009-09-24T08:27:00.000Z	felixsulla	Strife89	Lets dig around on Google here...
2009-09-24T08:30:00.000Z	Strife89	felixsulla	I can't search, my DS is my only way to the Internet 'till my laptop's back up, and it's running ClIRC at the moment.
2009-09-24T08:31:00.000Z	felixsulla	Strife89	What does "lshw -c network" show? Probably no card right?
2009-09-24T08:32:00.000Z	Strife89	felixsulla	Actually, it's there ... Says it's disabled.
2009-09-24T08:33:00.000Z	felixsulla	Strife89	Oh, ok. so we just have to enable it.
2009-09-24T08:34:00.000Z	felixsulla	Strife89	Um, .. so this is kind of a guess, but try "sudo ifconfig wlan0 up"
2009-09-24T08:35:00.000Z	Strife89	felixsulla	"SIOCSIFFLAGS: Resource temporarily unavailible"
