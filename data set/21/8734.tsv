2011-02-28T17:28:00.000Z	saini		x11/xlib not found problem
2011-02-28T17:29:00.000Z	saini		hello
2011-02-28T17:30:00.000Z	saini		x11/xlib priblem
2011-02-28T17:30:00.000Z	Fjodor	saini	What are you trying to do?
2011-02-28T17:31:00.000Z	Fjodor	saini	sudo apt-get install libx11-dev
2011-02-28T17:47:00.000Z	Fjodor	saini	sudo apt-get install gcc
2011-02-28T18:23:00.000Z	Fjodor	saini	Dr_Willis: I think the problem here is that whenever saini has posted a "query", other have relayed the query to ubottu...
2011-02-28T18:25:00.000Z	Fjodor	saini	Now you are starting to ask real questions - good :-) I don't know much about such, though, but others have suggested several above
2011-02-28T18:26:00.000Z	Fjodor	saini	I don't, but as Dr_Willis just said, look at Software Center
2011-02-28T18:26:00.000Z	Fjodor	saini	It's at the bottom of the Applications menu in the top panel to the left
2011-02-28T18:28:00.000Z	Fjodor	saini	Well, the manual in the link also explains about the software center...
2011-02-28T18:28:00.000Z	Fjodor	saini	It is basically a catalogue over what software you can install
2011-02-28T18:29:00.000Z	Fjodor	saini	Try playing around with it and look at that manual
2011-02-28T18:33:00.000Z	Fjodor	saini	That in paticular, you don't, but if you tell us which spoken language you normally use, we could suggest that you go the ubuntu channel for that language in here?
2011-02-28T18:34:00.000Z	Fjodor	saini	That would be in the texlive package that you can find in the software center. Could you please tell us your language, so we can find someone who may be better at helping you?
2011-02-28T18:35:00.000Z	Fjodor	saini	Do you normally speak French?
2011-02-28T18:40:00.000Z	Fjodor	saini	Do you normally speak French?
2011-02-28T18:40:00.000Z	Fjodor	saini	What then?
2011-02-28T18:41:00.000Z	Fjodor	saini	I ask because we seem to be speaking past each other, so I think that you don't normally speak English. Therefore, a channel with your normal language would probably be better for you
