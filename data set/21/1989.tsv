2010-05-19T05:31:00.000Z	JAMD456		Can someone help me? In terminal every time I run a command Fontconfig errors pop up
2010-05-19T05:32:00.000Z	Typos_King	JAMD456	   try another tab or close the termianal and reopen a new terminal session :)
2010-05-19T05:33:00.000Z	Typos_King	JAMD456	   I'd think some prior running lost/zombie process
2010-05-19T05:34:00.000Z	JAMD456	Typos_King	No it has been happening all week even when the computer is shutting down I am getting a list of font config errors rather then the shutdown splash
2010-05-19T05:35:00.000Z	Typos_King	JAMD456	   can you paste it for use to see?    pastie.org or paste2.com or so

2010-05-19T05:44:00.000Z	JAMD456	Typos_King	http://pastie.org/966857 the error I am getting
2010-05-19T05:45:00.000Z	Typos_King	JAMD456	  saw it :)
2010-05-19T05:46:00.000Z	Typos_King	JAMD456	  sounds as if it there's an error in /etc/fonts/fonts.conf :|
2010-05-19T05:46:00.000Z	JAMD456	Typos_King	How do I fix it?
2010-05-19T05:48:00.000Z	Typos_King	JAMD456	  check your /etc/fonts/fonts.conf, maybe you have a missing <cachedir> entry, in mine is on line 73
2010-05-19T05:49:00.000Z	JAMD456	Typos_King	will do
2010-05-19T05:49:00.000Z	JAMD456	Typos_King	the line is not there
2010-05-19T05:51:00.000Z	Typos_King	JAMD456	  mine looks like -> http://paste2.org/p/837301
2010-05-19T05:53:00.000Z	JAMD456	Typos_King	I am missing Huge Chunks of what is in your Fonts.conf
2010-05-19T05:54:00.000Z	Typos_King	JAMD456	  just bear in mind mine is for 9.1 :)
2010-05-19T05:55:00.000Z	JAMD456	Typos_King	in other words don't cut, paste and save :P ,Is there any way to restore mine
2010-05-19T05:55:00.000Z	Typos_King	JAMD456	  well, you can always try to do the cut/paste, just back yours up :)
2010-05-19T05:56:00.000Z	JAMD456	Typos_King	I will try that :S
2010-05-19T06:03:00.000Z	JAMD456	Typos_King	Thank you for your help, I fixed the problem by adding the <cachedir> lines from yours to mine
