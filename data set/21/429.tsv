2011-12-25T09:44:00.000Z	Stonecold		Uh, I just ran into another problem.  I'm trying to install Folding@home, but it says the program has an unknown filetype.
2011-12-25T09:44:00.000Z	Stonecold		But I'm pretty sure I downloaded the right version.
2011-12-25T09:44:00.000Z	Stonecold		I downloaded it.
2011-12-25T09:44:00.000Z	Stonecold		And tried to run the installer.
2011-12-25T09:45:00.000Z	Stonecold		Plus, Google Chrome (a .deb file) won't install either.
2011-12-25T09:47:00.000Z	tiox	Stonecold	Can you still install stuff from apt-get?
2011-12-25T09:47:00.000Z	Stonecold		apt-get?
2011-12-25T09:47:00.000Z	tiox		Yeah, in most Debian systems, apt-get is a CLI thing.
2011-12-25T09:47:00.000Z	Stonecold		I'm new to this, so I don't know what that is.
2011-12-25T09:47:00.000Z	tiox		sudo apt-get install foo bar baz
2011-12-25T09:48:00.000Z	tiox		Something you enter in terminal. As an example:
2011-12-25T09:48:00.000Z	tiox		sudo apt-get install wine
2011-12-25T09:48:00.000Z	tiox		Wait a second...
2011-12-25T09:49:00.000Z	tiox	Stonecold	Is Synaptic or Update Manager open?
2011-12-25T09:49:00.000Z	Stonecold	tiox	Hold on.  I think I might have got it.
2011-12-25T09:49:00.000Z	tiox		Because they use the apt-get protocol, and to avoid nastiness with having multiple programs installing using the same command-line stuff, only one program at a time utilizing apt is allowed to run.
2011-12-25T09:50:00.000Z	tiox		Example, if I have synaptic open, and using the software center to install something, I need to close synaptic for software center to function.
2011-12-25T09:51:00.000Z	tiox		Otherwise, please give us the error when you apt-get something.
2011-12-25T09:51:00.000Z	tiox	Stonecold	Copy from terminal (Ctrl+Shift+C) what it says when you run sudo apt-get install --reinstall gedit
2011-12-25T09:52:00.000Z	tiox		(Using gedit as the example, you can reinstall other programs as well simply to produce debug text.)
2011-12-25T09:52:00.000Z	Stonecold	tiox	I did download it from terminal, and I opened the folder, but none of the programs seem to be the installer.
