2006-10-10T09:27:00.000Z	segfault_	nickb_ldn	u install jave thru apt
2006-10-10T09:27:00.000Z	nickb_ldn	segfault_	yeah
2006-10-10T09:29:00.000Z	segfault_	nickb_ldn	mine shows this /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.5.0-sun/jre/bin/java under alternative java
2006-10-10T09:29:00.000Z	segfault_	nickb_ldn	u may want to reinstall java
2006-10-10T09:29:00.000Z	nickb_ldn	segfault_	I think I might have figured the problem.  One sec
2006-10-10T09:31:00.000Z	nickb_ldn	segfault_	All I have is /usr/lib/jvm/java-gcj/jre/bin/java - but sun java is def there.  Can I edit it manually? If I just cahnge the sym links myself its the saem thing?
2006-10-10T09:32:00.000Z	segfault_	nickb_ldn	yes u can add manually, and yes can u can change the symlinks by hand, but u should reinstall java and let dpkg set it up for u then just run update-alternatives
2006-10-10T09:33:00.000Z	nickb_ldn	segfault_	mean for you;)
2006-10-10T09:34:00.000Z	segfault_	nickb_ldn	that or just apt-get install --reinstall pkgname
2006-10-10T09:41:00.000Z	nickb_ldn	segfault_	I reinstalled sun java, then ran update alternatives, it still doesnt see sun java
2006-10-10T09:42:00.000Z	nickb_ldn	segfault_	Even worse - it has replaced all the symlinks to libgcj 1.4!
2006-10-10T09:46:00.000Z	segfault_	nickb_ldn	what is pkg name u reinstalled?
2006-10-10T09:47:00.000Z	nickb_ldn	segfault_	 sun-java5-jdk
2006-10-10T09:49:00.000Z	segfault_	nickb_ldn	u may try reinstalling sun-java5-[bin,jre,jdk] 
2006-10-10T09:50:00.000Z	nickb_ldn	segfault_	done that so many times today.  I think alternatives is all screwed.  It just wont see sun-java5-jdk
2006-10-10T09:50:00.000Z	segfault_	nickb_ldn	jdk pkg provides compilers etc and depends on jre pkg, which in turn depends on bin pkg
2006-10-10T09:50:00.000Z	segfault_	nickb_ldn	part of the install process for those pkgs is to add the items alternatives db
2006-10-10T09:51:00.000Z	nickb_ldn	segfault_	that doesnt seem to be happening
2006-10-10T09:51:00.000Z	segfault_	nickb_ldn	u may also try removing/purging bin pkg which should remove/purge all sunjava5 pkgs, and then reinstall them all
2006-10-10T09:52:00.000Z	nickb_ldn	segfault_	sorrry not sure what you mean by bin pkg?
2006-10-10T09:52:00.000Z	segfault_	nickb_ldn	sun-java5-bin
