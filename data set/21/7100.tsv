2008-01-22T20:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pie-rate	on all windowing systems (window apple unix baesd) the close button has allways closed the app
2008-01-22T20:54:00.000Z	Pie-rate	erUSUL	every single other application that uses a notification area icon like that stays open when you use the close button
2008-01-22T20:54:00.000Z	Pie-rate	erUSUL	there's no reason why rhythmbox should do that differently.
2008-01-22T20:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pie-rate	there exceptions to it but they are a few (application dependant) and usually you have to explicity enable the not normal behavior of "close button minimi to notification area/try"
2008-01-22T20:56:00.000Z	Pie-rate	erUSUL	no. pidgin and every single other instant messenger i can think of has a default behavior of minimizing to tray
2008-01-22T20:56:00.000Z	Pie-rate	erUSUL	as does banshee and every other music player with a tray icon i can think of
2008-01-22T20:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pie-rate	well what can i say use banshee then
2008-01-22T20:57:00.000Z	Pie-rate	erUSUL	i like rhythmbox, it's an annoyance that there should either be a pref for or should just be eliminated
2008-01-22T20:58:00.000Z	Pie-rate	erUSUL	no one complains about gaim minimizing to notification by default, tons of people complain about rhythmbox. it's a bad behavior and it should be changed.
2008-01-22T21:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pie-rate	you re free to raise a bug report on their bug trackin system or in launchpad or mail the developers this is open source. Use th source; Luke !!! ;)
2008-01-22T21:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pie-rate	also you can change it yourself XP
2008-01-22T21:00:00.000Z	Pie-rate	erUSUL	meh. i'll just change it myself
2008-01-22T21:01:00.000Z	Pie-rate	erUSUL	is there any way to do it through a plugin?
2008-01-22T21:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pie-rate	dunno; sorry
2008-01-22T21:02:00.000Z	Pie-rate	erUSUL	looks like probably not
2008-09-05T17:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pie-rate	amixer ? alsamixer?
2008-09-05T17:41:00.000Z	Pie-rate	erUSUL	neither of them can show the OSD
2008-09-05T17:42:00.000Z	Pie-rate	erUSUL	the little thing in the middle of the screen that displays the volume level when you adjust it with keyboard binds
2008-09-05T17:42:00.000Z	Pie-rate	erUSUL	i have not been able to find a way to show it at all
2008-09-05T17:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pie-rate	that is something managed by the machine bios via acpi i think ...
2008-09-05T17:43:00.000Z	Pie-rate	erUSUL	highly doubt...
