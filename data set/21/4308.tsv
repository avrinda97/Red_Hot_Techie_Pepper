2008-05-17T12:40:00.000Z	burner	JontyO	try the cd check to make sure your burn is ok?
2008-05-17T12:41:00.000Z	burner	JontyO	that is untrue about less features
2008-05-17T12:41:00.000Z	burner	JontyO	did you run the cd check? it's possible that both are bad... though unlikely I agree
2008-05-17T12:43:00.000Z	JontyO	burner	im using a download manager that verifies md5 so i told it to compare so i will know if its broken or not now (didnt use manager before)
2008-05-17T12:43:00.000Z	burner	JontyO	perfect.  best of luck
2008-05-17T12:44:00.000Z	burner	JontyO	out of curiosity, what type of laptop are you using?
2008-05-17T12:48:00.000Z	burner	JontyO	I didn't, but I haven't had stellar luck on Toshiba's historically
2008-05-17T12:49:00.000Z	JontyO	burner	stellar luck? good or bad?
2008-05-17T12:50:00.000Z	burner	JontyO	according to what I found, it looks like intel graphics which is nice, but I can't tell any of the other hardware... anyway.. i bet you'll be fine
2008-05-17T12:55:00.000Z	burner	JontyO	indeed
2008-05-17T12:56:00.000Z	burner	JontyO	 it's on by default if it can be.  otherwise system -> prefs -> appearance -> desktop effects tab
