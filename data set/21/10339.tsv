2005-10-19T07:43:00.000Z	fc9k		awww
2005-10-19T07:43:00.000Z	fc9k		nah i need to write from both ideally
2005-10-19T07:44:00.000Z	fc9k		its gonna have all my music and as i'm a linux newb i'll probably do all my tag updating in windows to start with
2005-10-19T07:44:00.000Z	jasp	fc9k	I have 250gig fat32 partition, no problem.
2005-10-19T07:45:00.000Z	jasp	fc9k	I'm not sure if you need to dwap drives though,
2005-10-19T07:53:00.000Z	jasp	fc9k	why have a seperate partition for windows programs?
2005-10-19T07:56:00.000Z	fc9k	jasp	reckon i'd be better sticking all windows progs/games etc on th same partition as windows?
2005-10-19T07:57:00.000Z	jasp	fc9k	yeah, why not. 15 GB would be fine for windows+apps, just add the rest to the big FAT32 partition, and install the games there.
2005-10-19T07:57:00.000Z	fc9k	jasp	why?  can the games be accessed by linux then?
2005-10-19T08:05:00.000Z	jasp	fc9k	looks good :-)
2005-10-19T08:05:00.000Z	fc9k	jasp	cheers for your help mate :)
2005-10-19T08:06:00.000Z	fc9k	jasp	right, any stuff i should know for that?
2005-10-19T08:08:00.000Z	fc9k	jasp	i was gonna install xp first anyway and create the ntfs shizinit there, then let ubuuntu make  a nice bootloader and do the ext3 and fat stuff within that
2005-10-19T08:09:00.000Z	jasp	fc9k	ah yes, that's probably a better plan. Are you sure you have an XP install cd, and not a recovery disk?
2005-10-19T08:10:00.000Z	fc9k	jasp	: don't worry, i have a full complement of microsoft software :D
2005-10-19T08:10:00.000Z	jasp	fc9k	Right ;-)
2005-10-19T08:11:00.000Z	fc9k	jasp	cheers
