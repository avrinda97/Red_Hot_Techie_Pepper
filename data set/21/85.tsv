2012-10-02T04:56:00.000Z	lJ6il		Hello. Big trouble here. A friend of mine has bought an asus eeepc 1225C, which contains an Intel GMA 3600. Can't have any resolution higher than 1024x768... I installed Xubuntu 12.04 32 bits. Launched jockey-gtk. Proposed me cedraview drivers for this card... But can't boot now.
2012-10-02T04:56:00.000Z	lJ6il		i mean i can boot but i'm talking to you through weechat on a tty
2012-10-02T04:57:00.000Z	lJ6il		Boot stuck with a message : "could not write bytes : broken pipe"
2012-10-02T04:58:00.000Z	lJ6il		√çt's 3 o clock here and my friend absolutely needs her laptop for tomorrow morning... If anyone has any idea...
2012-10-02T05:00:00.000Z	lJ6il		No one ?
2012-10-02T05:00:00.000Z	lobhater	lJ6il	 have you tried uninstalling the drivers and using the default for now
2012-10-02T05:01:00.000Z	lobhater	lJ6il	or just do a fresh install as a last resort :(
2012-10-02T05:05:00.000Z	lJ6il	lobhater	muelli ... Purged the drivers. But can't boot...
2012-10-02T05:06:00.000Z	lobhater	lJ6il	what is the error message it is giving you?
2012-10-02T05:07:00.000Z	lJ6il	lobhater	no more message. "Checking battery state. [ok]" then nothing
2012-10-02T05:08:00.000Z	lobhater	lJ6il	are you using lightdm?
2012-10-02T05:08:00.000Z	lJ6il	lobhater	no... Just using xubuntu out of the box (gdm i think ?)
2012-10-02T05:09:00.000Z	lobhater	lJ6il	at the tty type sudo service gdm restart
2012-10-02T05:10:00.000Z	lJ6il	lobhater	unrecognized service
2012-10-02T05:11:00.000Z	lJ6il	lobhater	coming back (reboot)
2012-10-02T05:13:00.000Z	lobhater	lJ6il	any luck? if not go to tty          startx           what is the output?
2012-10-02T05:13:00.000Z	lJ6il	lobhater	now it crashes after "stopping system v compatibility [ok]"...

2012-10-02T05:14:00.000Z	lobhater	lJ6il	huh?
