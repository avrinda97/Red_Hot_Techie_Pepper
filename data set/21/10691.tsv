2005-10-28T05:00:00.000Z	oly		umount says the resource is busy
2005-10-28T05:00:00.000Z	oly		and i need to insert cd 3
2005-10-28T05:00:00.000Z	queuetue	oly	Probaby means there was a hardware error or an open file - lsof |grep /path/to/cd ...
2005-10-28T05:00:00.000Z	oly		yes i am running as root
2005-10-28T05:00:00.000Z	oly		yeah cedega game
2005-10-28T05:00:00.000Z	oly		on 4 cds
2005-10-28T05:01:00.000Z	oly	queuetue	that command did nothing went straight back to the prompt
2005-10-28T05:02:00.000Z	oly		i got 2 cds installed using different drives, but i have run out half way through
2005-10-28T05:02:00.000Z	oly		need to get cd out to continue install
2005-10-28T05:02:00.000Z	queuetue	oly	if you did it right, indicates no open files- probably hardware glitch.
2005-10-28T05:03:00.000Z	oly		anything i can do about it ?
2005-10-28T05:03:00.000Z	queuetue	oly	Sounds like you restart the install to me...
2005-10-28T05:03:00.000Z	oly		doubt that will work, on bases it has locked both cd drives
2005-10-28T05:03:00.000Z	oly		so its probably not a one of
2005-10-28T05:04:00.000Z	oly		what would using a paper clip and forcing the eject on hardware side do ?
2005-10-28T05:05:00.000Z	queuetue	oly	not unmount the disk, certainly.
2005-10-28T05:05:00.000Z	queuetue	oly	Only physically remove the medium, it won't free up the wedge.  (I bet.)
2005-10-28T05:05:00.000Z	oly		yeah but i could put the new cd in, and click okay
2005-10-28T05:05:00.000Z	oly		or woudl it not detet the change
2005-10-28T05:05:00.000Z	queuetue	oly	And it would see the old disk, with errors.
