2010-10-02T19:12:00.000Z	bradyxc		I'm having trouble mounting a hhd, I'm running lucid...
2010-10-02T19:13:00.000Z	rusivi	bradyxc	Has this HDD been mounted in Lucid before?
2010-10-02T19:14:00.000Z	bradyxc	rusivi	yes when I try to mount it says that it is not found in fstab or mtab
2010-10-02T19:17:00.000Z	rusivi	bradyxc	Who is the HDD mfg, model, & serial #?
2010-10-02T19:18:00.000Z	bradyxc	rusivi	I don't know, I have the hhd for a few years
2010-10-02T19:18:00.000Z	rusivi	bradyxc	look on the bottom on the sticker as it will be helpful
2010-10-02T19:19:00.000Z	rusivi	bradyxc	Many HDD come pre-formatted with NTFS so you may need an NTFS interfacing package if it did not already come with Lucid.
2010-10-02T19:20:00.000Z	rusivi	bradyxc	Both one I got a week ago and one I got a few years ago were both NTFS out of the box
2010-10-02T19:20:00.000Z	bradyxc	rusivi	well this one is NTFS I have windows xp installed on it
2010-10-02T19:23:00.000Z	rusivi	bradyxc	ahhhhhh so your in the Live CD environment, poking around at your Windows XP partition(s)?
2010-10-02T19:23:00.000Z	bradyxc	rusivi	no I discovered linux after having filled most of my hhd so it was just easier to install linux on another hhd that I had
2010-10-02T19:24:00.000Z	rusivi	bradyxc	one of many NTFS related packages I have installed (in Maverick) is ntfs-3g
2010-10-02T19:25:00.000Z	bradyxc	rusivi	I have that as well...
2010-10-02T19:27:00.000Z	rusivi	bradyxc	This is going to sound silly but did a restart change anything?
2010-10-02T19:27:00.000Z	bradyxc	rusivi	not that I know of
2010-10-02T19:27:00.000Z	rusivi	bradyxc	ok so you restarted, and still same problem?
2010-10-02T19:28:00.000Z	bradyxc	rusivi	well I've been running linux for a few months...
2010-10-02T19:28:00.000Z	rusivi	bradyxc	duly noted but I need answer to my question please :)
2010-10-02T19:29:00.000Z	bradyxc	rusivi	no nothing has changed
2010-10-02T19:33:00.000Z	rusivi	bradyxc	ty. I would take a look at the history of how Lucid has been updating and see if you notice any of your NTFS or related packages been updated recently. As well, same with software you installed. Looking for correlation to date/time closest to when you first noticed this issue, then look for causation. I do not keep up on every update so I can only suggest the obvious (ntfs-related, fstab auto-accessing-type packages).
2010-10-02T19:33:00.000Z	bradyxc	rusivi	ok ty
