2006-12-11T13:25:00.000Z	mzanfardino		General question: I want to accesss my Ubuntu server (running Edgy) via my Ubuntu desktop (also running Edgy) X interface.  Do I need to have X installed on the server?
2006-12-11T13:25:00.000Z	LjL	mzanfardino	you can just use SSH i suppose, if you don't want to run graphical applications on the server
2006-12-11T13:26:00.000Z	LjL	mzanfardino	yes. or, couldn't you just set up file sharing and do it on the client side?
2006-12-11T13:27:00.000Z	LjL	mzanfardino	at any rate, if you just installed the program concerned (say Eclipse) on the server, the X libraries will be installed automatically
2006-12-11T13:27:00.000Z	mzanfardino	LjL	Good question.  I'm relatively new to Linux and not sure how to setup file sharing.  However, given that the files I need access to are in my www path, I'm not sure I want them shared for all acess...
2006-12-11T13:27:00.000Z	LjL	mzanfardino	err, that's what access control is for ;-) you know, passwords and the like
2006-12-11T13:28:00.000Z	LjL	mzanfardino	i'd definitely say so. an NFS or Samba server will do nicely
2006-12-16T07:03:00.000Z	LjL	mzanfardino	it's a bot. colors don't lie
2006-12-16T07:11:00.000Z	mzanfardino	LjL	Can I install KDE if I've already go GNOME installed?
2006-12-16T07:13:00.000Z	mzanfardino	LjL	thank you, but the link didn't answer the basic question: can I have both GNOME and KDE installed on the same system?
2006-12-16T07:13:00.000Z	LjL	mzanfardino	"to install from Ubuntu"... what does that suggest you? ;)
2006-12-16T07:14:00.000Z	LjL	mzanfardino	there are only two downsides that i can think of: 1) your Gnome menus get crowded by KDE applications, and your KDE menus likewise  2) if you later decide to uninstall either Gnome or KDE, it's not necessarily very easy
2006-12-16T07:14:00.000Z	LjL	mzanfardino	if you install KDE using aptitude instead of apt-get, the latter most probably becomes easier.
2006-12-16T07:16:00.000Z	mzanfardino	LjL	thank you.  I use Kate for javascript editing, and thought that if I installed KDE it might run more cleanly.
2006-12-16T07:16:00.000Z	LjL	mzanfardino	well, if you run KDE and then (besides Kate) mostly run GNOME programs on it, it'll be just as unclean or worse ;)
2006-12-16T07:17:00.000Z	mzanfardino	LjL	ok, any suggestions for a new GUI editor for languages like javascript that run will in GNOME?
2006-12-16T07:17:00.000Z	LjL	mzanfardino	i use KDE myself, so not really...
2006-12-16T07:18:00.000Z	mzanfardino	LjL	ok. I guess I will have to build a KDE vm and see if I like it any better (have no real preference, just used GNOME and not KDE).
2006-12-16T07:19:00.000Z	LjL	mzanfardino	actually, if you use aptitude to install it, i think you'll be able to completely remove it and be back to your GNOME desktop as you left it (perhaps making a new user for KDE might be best, if you really are concerned)
2006-12-16T07:19:00.000Z	LjL	mzanfardino	don't take my word on it, but i've done this before
2006-12-16T07:20:00.000Z	mzanfardino	LjL	thanks again
