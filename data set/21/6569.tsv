2007-06-11T09:17:00.000Z	m1r		i know i been nagging all night, but i really need some help in getting ftp server up on boot :/
2007-06-11T09:18:00.000Z	Frogzoo	m1r	ls /etc/rc2.d/*ftp*
2007-06-11T09:19:00.000Z	m1r	Frogzoo	sec
2007-06-11T09:19:00.000Z	m1r	Frogzoo	, seems no FTP there
2007-06-11T09:20:00.000Z	Frogzoo	m1r	which ftp package did you install?
2007-06-11T09:20:00.000Z	m1r	Frogzoo	, vsftpd, it runs ok but when i reboot then it dont show files in ftp fplder
2007-06-11T09:21:00.000Z	Frogzoo	m1r	easiest perhaps to install wu-ftpd, which has the scripts to start on boot
2007-06-11T09:21:00.000Z	m1r	Frogzoo	i have to do : mount --bind /var/www/sitename /home/ftp/sitename ; to be able to see files again after every reboot, and is quite frustrating
2007-06-11T09:22:00.000Z	m1r		vsftpd starts on boot :/
2007-06-11T09:22:00.000Z	Frogzoo	m1r	can you do that mount from /etc/fstab?
2007-06-11T09:23:00.000Z	m1r		i dont know how to try that Frogzoo
2007-06-11T09:23:00.000Z	m1r		i tryed b4 but seems somthing was wrong
2007-06-11T09:23:00.000Z	Frogzoo	m1r	in that case, just put that mount command in /etc/rc.local
2007-06-11T09:23:00.000Z	Frogzoo	m1r	it's dirty, but it will work
2007-06-11T09:24:00.000Z	m1r		ok ty, i will go try help
2007-06-11T09:24:00.000Z	m1r		help, = test :)
2007-06-11T09:24:00.000Z	m1r		br
2007-06-11T09:24:00.000Z	m1r		brb
2007-06-11T09:25:00.000Z	m1r	Frogzoo	only thing it says here is : exit 0
2007-06-11T09:25:00.000Z	m1r		put it b4 or after it ?
2007-06-11T09:26:00.000Z	Frogzoo	m1r	before
