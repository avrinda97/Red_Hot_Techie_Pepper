2007-01-21T15:13:00.000Z	gecko		i would use 64 bit but software incompatibilities kept me from doing that, with my small linux experience

2007-01-21T15:14:00.000Z	gecko		DarkGuy: yea..ill stick to Gnome... i have both 64 bit and 32... once i get good with 32 and command line..ill move back to 64..
2007-01-21T15:15:00.000Z	gecko		what is so great about Fluxbuntu?
2007-01-21T15:15:00.000Z	riotkittie	gecko	Fluxbuntu ... has the Fluxbox WM which is insanely speedy and lightweight
2007-01-21T15:16:00.000Z	gecko	riotkittie	isnt it more simple tho? sort of like DSL distro looking lol?
2007-01-21T15:17:00.000Z	riotkittie	gecko	yes. DSL has fluxbox.  simplicity rocks, though. but you can customize it to your liking for the most part
2007-01-21T15:17:00.000Z	gecko	riotkittie	im not experienced enough in linux to even get the basics done..let alone set up customizations of fluxbox..or install it lol

2007-01-21T15:19:00.000Z	gecko	riotkittie	dont get what u mean there.
2007-01-21T15:20:00.000Z	riotkittie	gecko	yeah, youre new, but really, you can do anything :P you may not succeed at first but the ubuntu community at large is great, there's guides and easy to follow how-tos for almost everything
2007-01-21T12:49:00.000Z	riotkittie	gecko	what do you dislike about them ?
