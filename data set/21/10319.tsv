2010-07-16T08:00:00.000Z	n00b_		when i update or install any software in my ubuntu 10.04 through software centre or synaptics the first package gets downloaded recursively and ultimaltely nothing gets installed moreover sometines it says check your internet connections and sometimes package not found
2010-07-16T08:00:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	n00b_	Check your network connection - that seems to be part of the issue mate.
2010-07-16T08:01:00.000Z	n00b_	YankDownUnder	my network is fine
2010-07-16T08:02:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	n00b_	I didn't say your NETWORK was not fine, I'm saying check your connection settings in the Network Manager - you can also try in a terminal to do: sudo apt-get update => then see what the connectivity is like first hand.
2010-07-16T08:03:00.000Z	n00b_	YankDownUnder	i ran sudo apt-get update also with parameters --fix-broken and --fix-missing everything went fine
2010-07-16T08:04:00.000Z	n00b_	YankDownUnder	but ya sometimes it do gie issues
2010-07-16T08:08:00.000Z	n00b_	YankDownUnder	wat to do???
2010-07-16T08:09:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	n00b_	I'd do everything from the terminal if the graphical package manager doesn't cut the mustard - or start troubleshooting your actual network connection - not the network - but the connection.
2010-07-16T08:10:00.000Z	n00b_	YankDownUnder	how???
2010-07-16T08:10:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	n00b_	HOw...um...what? To update and install packages from the term? Or how to troubleshoot the network connection?
2010-07-16T08:11:00.000Z	n00b_	YankDownUnder	Troubleshoot network connection
2010-07-16T08:12:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	n00b_	Edit the connection. Change the settings - or at least make SURE the settings are correct for your network. YOu can always add in an external DNS server for giggles and grins to see if that helps you out - cuz if the package manager cannot resolve a server's name, it's not going to be able to update, right?
2010-07-16T08:14:00.000Z	n00b_	YankDownUnder	i am studying in a college and settingss are default to match up also this is the first of its kind that i have encounterd also the prob persists in command line
2010-07-16T08:15:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	n00b_	90% of what you just said doesn't make sense.
2010-07-16T08:15:00.000Z	n00b_	YankDownUnder	the prob persists even when i use terminal
2010-07-16T08:16:00.000Z	n00b_	YankDownUnder	i am using default settings
2010-07-16T08:16:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	n00b_	Mate, try changing some settings - as I said, add an external DNS server to your network connection and see if that makes a differences. Try 139.130.4.5 for instance.
2010-07-16T08:18:00.000Z	n00b_	YankDownUnder	how to do that
2010-07-16T08:18:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	n00b_	Right click network manager icon, choose edit connnections -> yadda yadda yadda
2010-07-16T08:19:00.000Z	n00b_	YankDownUnder	then
2010-07-16T08:21:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	n00b_	Edit the network connection, add 139.130.4.5 to your normal DNS server list - restart the connection, try again doing an update.
