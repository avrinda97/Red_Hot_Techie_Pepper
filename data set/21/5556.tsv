2007-10-18T01:11:00.000Z	frijolie		hey all
2007-10-18T01:11:00.000Z	frijolie		i'm trying to format an external USB HDD and having trouble
2007-10-18T01:12:00.000Z	frijolie		if i want to share it between Gutsy and a Windows box what's the best filesystem? NTFS, ext3?
2007-10-18T01:14:00.000Z	frijolie		what's the best filesystem to share between windows and linux? nTFS or ext3?
2007-10-18T01:14:00.000Z	Dr_willis	frijolie	 linux  can read/wite ntfs wth the ntfs-3g stuff/ windows can read/write ext3 with some ifs-drivers.org stuff. :)
2007-10-18T01:14:00.000Z	Dr_willis	frijolie	 it depends on your needs.
2007-10-18T01:15:00.000Z	Dr_willis	frijolie	 use vfat then
2007-10-18T01:16:00.000Z	frijolie	Dr_willis	never heard of vfat
2007-10-18T01:18:00.000Z	Dr_willis	frijolie	 set it up with Linux. windows wont let you make a large fat32 filessytem
2007-10-18T01:19:00.000Z	frijolie	Dr_willis	you just use fdisk right? Sorry, never formatted anything with Linux before
2007-10-18T01:19:00.000Z	Dr_willis	frijolie	 use gparted
2007-10-18T01:19:00.000Z	Dr_willis	frijolie	 or fdisk. :)
2007-10-18T01:20:00.000Z	frijolie	Dr_willis	is GParted a distro or an application?
2007-10-18T01:21:00.000Z	Dr_willis	frijolie	 its on the cd/install/livecd :)
2007-10-18T01:21:00.000Z	Dr_willis	frijolie	 theres also a gparted-livecd
2007-10-18T01:22:00.000Z	frijolie	Dr_willis	so boot to the liveCD and format it that way? I'd be afraid that I'd repartition my data or something
2007-10-18T01:22:00.000Z	frijolie	Dr_willis	is it pretty straightforward?
2008-02-15T05:30:00.000Z	Dr_willis	frijolie	 thats the basics of it  mount /dev/sda2 (or whatever) to /home
2008-02-15T05:31:00.000Z	frijolie	Dr_willis	during an install? or do you just leave it as "free space" where it is automatically allocated to the /home directory?
2008-02-15T05:32:00.000Z	Dr_willis	frijolie	 in my case i have a filesystem at /dev/hdb1 - the whole disk. That i tell the installer to mount to /home
2008-02-15T05:32:00.000Z	Dr_willis	frijolie	 its allready setup for me - since its my old home. Its not unallocated.. In your case for the first time you may need to format it.
