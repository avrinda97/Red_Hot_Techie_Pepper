2006-06-04T09:36:00.000Z	titan		what key command do I use to bring up that window I can type commands in like xkill?
2006-06-04T09:37:00.000Z	andi5	titan	alt-f2?
2006-06-04T09:37:00.000Z	titan	andi5	ya, that is what I thought it was... but it does nothing :(
2006-06-04T09:37:00.000Z	andi5	titan	check system->settings->keyboard
2006-06-04T09:38:00.000Z	titan	andi5	the keyboard shortcut window?
2006-06-04T09:39:00.000Z	andi5	titan	yes, it should have an entry for this window
2006-06-04T09:41:00.000Z	titan	andi5	ok, there it us, Show the panel run application dialog, and the shortcut is what you said it should be but it still does nothing.
2006-06-04T09:41:00.000Z	andi5	titan	change it to your choice... maybe it called it differently
2006-06-04T09:45:00.000Z	titan	andi5	don't laugh too hard, but I guess I can not set it to alt-f3 =P
2006-06-04T09:45:00.000Z	andi5	titan	why that?
2006-06-04T09:46:00.000Z	andi5	titan	deskbar running? ;-)
2006-06-04T09:46:00.000Z	titan	andi5	because it shutdown my xwindows and logged me out
2006-06-04T09:46:00.000Z	andi5	titan	*g*
2006-06-04T09:46:00.000Z	andi5	titan	do you know why?
2006-06-04T09:46:00.000Z	titan	andi5	know why what?
2006-06-04T09:47:00.000Z	andi5	titan	why this key combo kicked you?
2006-06-04T09:47:00.000Z	titan	andi5	not exactly, just assume it shutsdown my xwindows and logs me out.
2006-06-04T09:48:00.000Z	andi5	titan	i guess you know how to change the combos, right? when you active an entry all other combos are _deactivated_, so you should not see any side effects
2006-06-04T09:49:00.000Z	titan	andi5	well I clicked on it to activate it and tried to put the combo but it just shut me down.
2006-06-04T09:49:00.000Z	andi5	titan	weird..... do you have other software running that takes key shortcuts?
2006-06-04T09:50:00.000Z	titan	andi5	I was running cedega on the other desktop
