2005-06-12T14:42:00.000Z	benplaut		anyone here have/use an IBM Atheros A/B/G Mini-PCI wireless card?
2005-06-12T14:43:00.000Z	FR500	benplaut	i have an atheros ABG
2005-06-12T14:45:00.000Z	FR500	benplaut	yes
2005-06-12T14:48:00.000Z	FR500	benplaut	consider urself lucky, when fc2 was released there was no way to get it to work till ndiswrapper 0.1
2005-06-12T14:48:00.000Z	FR500	benplaut	can you connect?
2005-06-12T14:54:00.000Z	FR500	benplaut	did you get it to work?
2005-06-12T14:54:00.000Z	FR500	benplaut	it works with madwifi
2005-06-12T15:05:00.000Z	benplaut	FR500	had to go out and fold a tent :p  | yeah, it works, but scanning does not work, so therefore i can only connect using the Gnome network applet, becuase all the other applets (like GTKwifi) require scanning to work
2005-06-12T15:06:00.000Z	FR500	benplaut	that is weird, usually if scan doesnt work you can't set essit
2005-06-28T12:28:00.000Z	FR500	benplaut	overall i think ubuntu is a better end user distro, fedora targets a broader group of people
2005-06-28T12:29:00.000Z	benplaut	FR500	so do i, but it's good to try every distro you can...
2005-06-28T12:29:00.000Z	FR500	benplaut	i used to, but i got "stuck" here
2005-06-28T12:30:00.000Z	benplaut	FR500	same :)
2005-09-23T11:50:00.000Z	FR500	benplaut	did you find out what command triggers the shutdown options screen?
2005-09-23T11:51:00.000Z	FR500	benplaut	what command would you use to shutdown without being a superuser?
2005-09-23T11:51:00.000Z	FR500	benplaut	that asks for root
2005-09-23T11:51:00.000Z	FR500	benplaut	i want to be able to shutdown from beep-media-player for instance
2005-09-23T11:52:00.000Z	FR500	benplaut	with the alarm plugin
2005-09-23T11:52:00.000Z	benplaut	FR500	cool tool for figuring out keysyms
2005-09-23T11:57:00.000Z	benplaut	FR500	he's got a DWL-G520
2005-09-23T11:58:00.000Z	FR500	benplaut	he said atheros
