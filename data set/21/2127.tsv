2010-01-10T04:19:00.000Z	Aled		Guys this is a serious question I'm considering using it as a replacement for XP so that my Mum can use it
2010-01-10T04:19:00.000Z	Aled		then dual boot XP so I can play games on the same machine
2010-01-10T04:19:00.000Z	Aled		No
2010-01-10T04:20:00.000Z	Aled		But she's all about "OH I HOPE THE COMPUTER IS SECURE" all the time and I thought is Ubuntu more secure
2010-01-10T04:20:00.000Z	Aled		it's my computer
2010-01-10T04:20:00.000Z	Aled		she just leeches off it
2010-01-10T04:20:00.000Z	Aled		all she does is go on the internet
2010-01-10T04:20:00.000Z	Aled		Yes, brian
2010-01-10T04:21:00.000Z	Aled		I built the computer
2010-01-10T04:21:00.000Z	Aled		for my personal use specificially
2010-01-10T04:21:00.000Z	brianherman_home	Aled	Yet she still uses it...
2010-01-10T04:19:00.000Z	brianherman_home	Aled	Do you want your mom to hate you?
2010-01-10T04:20:00.000Z	brianherman_home	Aled	then dont install linux on her computer
2010-01-10T04:20:00.000Z	brianherman_home	Aled	....
2010-01-10T04:20:00.000Z	brianherman_home	Aled	All she wants is something usable.
2010-01-10T04:20:00.000Z	brianherman_home	Aled	Do you live in the same house?
2010-01-10T04:21:00.000Z	brianherman_home	Aled	Then its your mom's computer because she owns the house.
2010-01-10T04:21:00.000Z	brianherman_home	Aled	That doesnt matter, your mom wants a computer that she can use.
2010-01-10T04:23:00.000Z	brianherman_home	Aled	Do you hate your mother?
2010-01-10T04:23:00.000Z	brianherman_home	Aled	Then buy another slow computer to use linux on
2010-01-10T04:24:00.000Z	brianherman_home	Aled	Linux doesn't requre much
