2006-09-08T06:51:00.000Z	justin_		Unless you have some strange new alien hardware ;)
2006-09-08T06:51:00.000Z	justin_		Sometimes it may even remove "ubuntu-base" and that just screws everything up
2006-09-08T06:52:00.000Z	lupine_85	justin_	doesn't it mean "ubuntu official package"?
2006-09-08T06:52:00.000Z	justin_	lupine_85	Not really, you can compile things from source - and they still show up with that logo, it means that the file is somehow tied to the core
2006-09-08T06:54:00.000Z	lupine_85	justin_	you can if you aptitude install it :)
2006-09-08T06:55:00.000Z	justin_	lupine_85	That is how I did it
2006-09-08T06:56:00.000Z	justin_	lupine_85	No it tanks Xubuntu --- I tryed it on another machine, freezes and can't find this and that bah! :P
2006-09-08T06:57:00.000Z	justin_	lupine_85	Yeah maybe, but keep in mind its XUbuntu and not Ubuntu either..
2006-09-08T06:58:00.000Z	justin_	lupine_85	Yup, it seems to handle packages differently though
2006-09-08T06:59:00.000Z	justin_	lupine_85	Not sure but I have sent the emails to the Xubuntu people - so we'll see what happens.
2006-09-10T05:37:00.000Z	justin_	lupine_85	Still promoting firefox are we
2006-09-10T05:54:00.000Z	justin_	lupine_85	I agree, they need to come to a standard..
2006-09-13T07:17:00.000Z	justin_	lupine_85	What do you mean by "basic" linux? - you mean console only? heh...
2006-09-13T07:18:00.000Z	justin_	lupine_85	Yeah, well as this is 2006 --- I would say that is extremely basic ;) --- but it is true, console can still do a whole lot all the same.. almost anything X can do, console can do... almost everything.
2006-12-26T16:37:00.000Z	lupine_85	justin_	yes
2006-12-26T16:37:00.000Z	justin_	lupine_85	Excellent would you have a link to some d
2006-12-26T16:38:00.000Z	lupine_85	justin_	there are examples in the file itself, or you can try the manpage
2006-12-26T16:38:00.000Z	justin_	lupine_85	O,1 would be the second hardrive?
2006-12-26T16:39:00.000Z	lupine_85	justin_	hda1 would be hd(0,0); hdb1 would be hd(1,0)
2006-12-26T16:39:00.000Z	justin_	lupine_85	:) I see thanks
2006-12-26T16:40:00.000Z	justin_	lupine_85	Yeah, I was just confused by the numbers I got the rest -- alright thanks lupine_85  :)
