2005-01-27T14:58:00.000Z	Vlad		sorry, i meant the package 1st time
2005-01-27T14:59:00.000Z	Vlad		linux for dummies
2005-01-27T14:59:00.000Z	Vlad		i suggest using mandrake or fedora if you're a complete n00b
2005-01-27T15:00:00.000Z	Vlad		only becaus ei've not tried this distro yet ;)
2005-01-27T15:00:00.000Z	Vlad		i've only had bad crap happen with rpms
2005-01-27T15:00:00.000Z	Vlad		but i usually put that down to just me
2005-01-27T15:01:00.000Z	Vlad		i don't agree with the rpm bit.  if you want a basic system that 'looks' like windows.. feora or mandrake is perfect
2005-01-27T15:02:00.000Z	Vlad		Moby, that's why i put 'not tried this distro'
2005-01-27T15:02:00.000Z	Vlad		same to froust
2005-01-27T15:02:00.000Z	Vlad		did i say perfect?
2005-01-27T15:02:00.000Z	melazyboy	Vlad	yes, you did
2005-01-27T15:07:00.000Z	melazyboy	Vlad	but there not mandrake is a horrable distro that brings nothing to the table, it holds no advantages anymore almost what so ever, granted it has a few utilities that work decent with kde, but they don't rival that of say SUSE with SAX2, and fedora is a devel distro thats cracked up with hype and isn't even all that user friendly
2005-01-27T15:48:00.000Z	melazyboy	Vlad	What makes you say apache isn't the most secure?
2005-01-27T15:49:00.000Z	melazyboy	Vlad	Im not able to think of any other web server that has lived up to the tests of apache -- which generally speaking has issued no critical bugs for version 1.3 in the like the past 5years, and 2.0 hasn't issued one in the past 2yearish
2005-01-27T15:50:00.000Z	melazyboy	Vlad	I can't think of any 'hacks' to apache only the insecure modules that run ontop of it
2005-01-27T15:55:00.000Z	melazyboy	Vlad	... so?
2005-01-27T15:57:00.000Z	melazyboy	Vlad	So why don't they just hack the iptables and fuck over the whole linux server community?
2005-01-27T16:02:00.000Z	melazyboy	Vlad	your opinions suck, nothing is less secure because it is more popular there is no corelation between popularity and security; your arguement is moot.
2005-01-27T16:04:00.000Z	melazyboy	Vlad	Apache is for all intensive purposes with no modules is as close to 'inhackable' as can be achieved. its open source, 50,000 people have their eyes on it, and no one is seeing anything, no records of active bugs, no critical improvements in design can be made
2005-01-27T16:05:00.000Z	melazyboy	Vlad	omfg what a stupid claim MS owns over 95% of the market so their products will be more insecure, what does MS market share have to do with their programming style, using your same rediciolus arguement, linux has less people looking at it because less people use it and the hackers are distracted with windows, therefore one can only conclude that the mass of the bugs in linux are yet to be discovered
2005-01-27T16:08:00.000Z	melazyboy	Vlad	go away
