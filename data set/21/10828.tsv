2005-03-30T09:51:00.000Z	sabmoc	PlasmaPain	do you mean a desktop tool, or an command line tool?
2005-03-30T09:52:00.000Z	sabmoc	PlasmaPain	yes, a partition tool for the desktop, or a command line partition tool?
2005-03-30T09:53:00.000Z	sabmoc	PlasmaPain	fdisk, or from the desktop you can use qtparted, it is a partition magic clone.
2005-03-30T09:56:00.000Z	sabmoc	PlasmaPain	yes there is
2005-03-30T09:56:00.000Z	sabmoc	PlasmaPain	you're welcome to try
2005-03-30T10:02:00.000Z	sabmoc	PlasmaPain	no
2005-03-30T10:03:00.000Z	sabmoc	PlasmaPain	google for rootkit, rootkit is not a virus, its a piece of software a hacker secretly installs on a system he/she has compromized so that they can gain access automatically
2005-03-30T10:04:00.000Z	sabmoc	PlasmaPain	its called a root kit because it gives hackers root access, and a backdoor to the system, basically they own j00
2005-03-30T10:04:00.000Z	sabmoc	PlasmaPain	there is a program you can install that scans for all known rootkits, like a virusdetector
2005-03-30T10:06:00.000Z	sabmoc	PlasmaPain	the difference between a virus and a rootkit is that viruses or worms can install themselves by a script runing loose on the internet, sometimes thousands of windows boxed are compromized, but a rootkit needs to be installed by hand. Which would you rather prefer?
