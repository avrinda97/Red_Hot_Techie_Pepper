2005-09-11T13:12:00.000Z	ar_media		i'm liking Ubuntu is pretty kool i like it.  but i really like Fedora too...  I miss yum, i don't think apt-get is as good.
2005-09-11T13:13:00.000Z	bob2	ar_media	in what way?
2005-09-11T13:13:00.000Z	bob2	ar_media	apt-cache search blah
2005-09-11T13:13:00.000Z	bob2	ar_media	how is that unintuitive?
2005-09-11T13:14:00.000Z	bob2	ar_media	bear in mind apt-get and apt-cache are not meant for end users
2005-09-11T13:14:00.000Z	bob2	ar_media	aptitude/synaptic are the higher level tools you should use
2005-09-11T13:14:00.000Z	bob2	ar_media	use aptitude then.  aptitute search blah, aptitude install blah.
2005-09-11T13:15:00.000Z	bob2	ar_media	er, aptitude is a command line tool
2005-09-11T13:15:00.000Z	bob2	ar_media	yes, synaptic is a gui tool
2005-09-11T13:16:00.000Z	bob2	ar_media	aptitude is what you should be using on the command line
2005-09-11T13:16:00.000Z	bob2	ar_media	I'm not trying to be rude, I'm just clarifying
2005-09-11T13:24:00.000Z	bob2	ar_media	I'm not sure I understand your rant
2005-09-11T13:25:00.000Z	ar_media	bob2	it's not important
2005-09-12T08:27:00.000Z	bob2	ar_media	you edit the grub config, /boot/grub/menu.lst, but that will happen by default
2005-09-12T08:29:00.000Z	bob2	ar_media	so, be quiet and do what I said
