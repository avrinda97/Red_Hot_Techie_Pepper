2011-01-27T23:30:00.000Z	Danny_Joris		some version control program checked EVERY file on ubuntu if it's up to date or not... What can I do about it?
2011-01-27T23:30:00.000Z	Danny_Joris		Ubuntu runs really slow now
2011-01-27T23:32:00.000Z	schnuffle	Danny_Joris	Check if your pc starts swapping with sudo top
2011-01-27T23:34:00.000Z	Danny_Joris	schnuffle	not sure what you mean with swapping. Xorg has 50%, software center 24..
2011-01-27T23:34:00.000Z	Danny_Joris	schnuffle	747512k total swap 0 used
2011-01-27T23:34:00.000Z	schnuffle	Danny_Joris	tere is a line called swap how much is used?
2011-01-27T23:35:00.000Z	Danny_Joris	schnuffle	299176k cached
2011-01-27T23:35:00.000Z	schnuffle	Danny_Joris	okay not swapping, then wat means slow, your whole pc or jut drupal?
2011-01-27T23:36:00.000Z	Danny_Joris	schnuffle	ubuntu in virtualbox
2011-01-27T23:37:00.000Z	Danny_Joris	schnuffle	even the files on my desktop http://www.dannyjoris.be/files/fora/ubuntu-desktop.png
2011-01-27T23:38:00.000Z	schnuffle	Danny_Joris	the nex one on't telling the truth at the beginning :). So what is slow only the VM or your host system?
2011-01-27T23:39:00.000Z	Danny_Joris	schnuffle	the VM
2011-01-27T23:39:00.000Z	schnuffle	Danny_Joris	what happens if you stop apache: sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 stop
2011-01-27T23:41:00.000Z	Danny_Joris	schnuffle	still very slow
2011-01-27T23:42:00.000Z	schnuffle	Danny_Joris	so check if your host system is swapping. How much memory did you give the vm and how much does the host have
2011-01-27T23:42:00.000Z	Danny_Joris	schnuffle	2gb ram each
2011-01-27T23:43:00.000Z	Danny_Joris	schnuffle	I really think it's some version control program that is bloating my files
2011-01-27T23:43:00.000Z	schnuffle	Danny_Joris	so your host has 2GB RAM an the vm got GB? Give omly 1GB to the vm and restart
2011-01-27T23:44:00.000Z	Danny_Joris	schnuffle	VM has 2gb and host has 2gb. Will do..
2011-01-27T23:45:00.000Z	Danny_Joris	schnuffle	and i have only one cpu
2011-01-27T23:46:00.000Z	schnuffle	Danny_Joris	thats okay, if you give all memory to the vm, the host doesn't have any resources left for itself
