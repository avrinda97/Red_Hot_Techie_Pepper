2006-04-11T14:13:00.000Z	saik0		hello DBO
2006-04-11T14:14:00.000Z	DBO	saik0	you are in audioscrobbler too... weird...
2006-04-11T14:14:00.000Z	saik0	DBO	not going to start hugging me cross server now are you =P
2006-04-11T14:15:00.000Z	DBO	saik0	we need to save offtopic for the other server
2006-04-12T10:50:00.000Z	saik0	DBO	apache owns /var/www and there should be the deafult apache page there
2006-04-12T10:50:00.000Z	DBO	saik0	check out his IP, doesnt quite work
2006-04-12T10:51:00.000Z	saik0	DBO	from the outside probably not if he's behind any sort of nay/firewall
2006-04-12T10:52:00.000Z	DBO	saik0	no, just look at his site (fast, before he fixes the error)
2006-04-12T10:52:00.000Z	DBO	saik0	too late, he fixed it
2006-04-12T11:10:00.000Z	DBO	saik0	he knows, it was a mistake
2006-04-15T16:07:00.000Z	saik0	DBO	and ziesemer, so it's a GnomeVFS thing?
2006-04-15T16:07:00.000Z	DBO	saik0	my guess is its just this samba client
2006-04-15T16:21:00.000Z	DBO	saik0	we got smb connected already
2006-04-15T16:23:00.000Z	saik0	DBO	and ziesemer, perhaps theres something intresting you could hack together with FUSE and PAM?
2006-04-15T16:25:00.000Z	DBO	saik0	aint no way Im taking that flag and running with it... FUSE is a pain as it is...
2006-04-15T16:26:00.000Z	saik0	DBO	yea...youre right
2006-04-15T05:04:00.000Z	DBO	saik0	im up for it if you are
2006-04-19T11:15:00.000Z	saik0	DBO	hi
2006-04-22T12:55:00.000Z	DBO	saik0	yeah, its in his smb.conf
2006-04-22T12:55:00.000Z	saik0	DBO	just making sure, it does NFS too
