2007-11-20T11:07:00.000Z	arun_		if i use the ubuntu feisty fawn live cd on a windows machine, does the live cd automatically mount the windows drives?
2007-11-20T11:07:00.000Z	arun_		i am trying to recover some files on a friend's computer
2007-11-20T11:07:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	arun_	no i don't think so...
2007-11-20T11:07:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	arun_	the gutsy CD's do.
2007-11-20T11:07:00.000Z	arun_	IndyGunFreak	you sure?
2007-11-20T11:08:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	arun_	almost 100%.
2007-11-20T11:08:00.000Z	arun_	IndyGunFreak	the gutsy live cd mounts the windows drives automatically?
2007-11-20T11:09:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	arun_	on my PC(which dualboots), when i installed 7.10, it automounted my XP Home drive, but i use the alternate install CD, but I can only imagine that means it would have mounted fine on a live CD.
2007-11-20T11:09:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	arun_	hold on, i think I have a Live CD, I'll boot it on my PC and check
2007-11-20T11:09:00.000Z	arun_	IndyGunFreak	alright, thanks :)
2007-11-20T11:12:00.000Z	arun_	IndyGunFreak	any luck?
2007-11-20T11:12:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	arun_	i just found it, its booting now.
2007-11-20T11:16:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	arun_	yes, all i had to do was go to Computer, right click my windows drive and mount it, no chmodding, etcl.
2007-11-20T11:16:00.000Z	arun_	IndyGunFreak	Cool, it displays the windows drive automatically, right? All I have to do is right click and mount?
2007-11-20T11:17:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	arun_	it did for me.
2007-11-20T11:17:00.000Z	arun_	IndyGunFreak	cool. and this is the gutsy live cd?
2007-11-20T11:17:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		yes
2007-11-20T11:22:00.000Z	arun_		thanks a million IndyGunFreak :)
2007-11-20T11:22:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	arun_	np.. it worked i assume?
2007-11-20T11:23:00.000Z	arun_	IndyGunFreak	really appreciate it. yeah it worked. for some reason the feisty live cd also seems to mount the drives automatically
2007-11-20T11:23:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	arun_	hmm, never had much luck with Feisty CD's automatically mounting them.
