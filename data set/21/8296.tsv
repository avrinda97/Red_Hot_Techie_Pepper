2006-05-03T15:01:00.000Z	NoobSauce		oh well, once I get it all working, I'm sure it'll all be worth it :)
2006-05-03T15:01:00.000Z	NoobSauce		well, I have it up and running ok, I guess it's not 'barely functional'.
2006-05-03T15:01:00.000Z	NoobSauce		mainly I'm trying to get xgl working, and the first step is getting nvidia drivers up and running
2006-05-03T15:02:00.000Z	NoobSauce		well, regardless, I haven't gotten to the xgl part yet. At this point, I can't even get the nvidia drivers to install
2006-05-03T15:03:00.000Z	NoobSauce		oh so many errors :) I dont' even know where to start
2006-05-03T15:03:00.000Z	NoobSauce		heh, that's very true
2006-05-03T15:04:00.000Z	NoobSauce		ok, so if I do an apt-get install nvidia-glx nvidia-kernel-common, it will install both packages seamlessly
2006-05-03T15:04:00.000Z	NoobSauce		I'm setting up ubuntu 6.06 with kernel 2.6.15-19-amd64-generic
2006-05-03T15:05:00.000Z	NoobSauce		so anyways, nvidia-glx and nvidia-kernel-common install fine, but when I edit the xorg-conf file to include nvidia instead of nv, the xserver just won't start
2006-05-03T15:06:00.000Z	NoobSauce		I tried both of those
2006-05-03T15:06:00.000Z	holycow	NoobSauce	we can really only help with breezy sorry
2006-05-03T15:07:00.000Z	holycow	NoobSauce	why?
2006-05-03T15:09:00.000Z	holycow	NoobSauce	on all installs it works fine so far
2006-05-03T15:10:00.000Z	holycow	NoobSauce	stick with breezy for now until dapper is released
2006-05-03T15:11:00.000Z	holycow	NoobSauce	if i can offer one piece of advice when you are leaerning anything technical ....
2006-05-03T15:11:00.000Z	NoobSauce	holycow	sure
2006-05-03T15:13:00.000Z	NoobSauce	holycow	I've spent like 60 hours researching... I only come here as a last resort
2006-05-03T15:14:00.000Z	holycow	NoobSauce	no worries, consider me part of your research then
2006-05-03T15:15:00.000Z	NoobSauce	holycow	or they need it for work like me :(
2006-05-11T12:56:00.000Z	holycow	NoobSauce	theonly way is to write a little bash script with some regex to do that ... i can't really help you write it, but thats how its done
2006-05-11T12:57:00.000Z	holycow	NoobSauce	but be warned, make sure you have a backup of everything
