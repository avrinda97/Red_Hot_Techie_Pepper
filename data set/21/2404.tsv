2009-10-26T10:30:00.000Z	maco	krummaluf	gtk-window-decorator and kde-window-decorator are the normal decorators now. they use standard metacity & kwin themes
2009-10-26T10:30:00.000Z	maco	krummaluf	which, again... gnome-look.org, kde-look.org
2009-10-26T10:31:00.000Z	maco	krummaluf	are you using ubuntu or kubuntu?
2009-10-26T10:31:00.000Z	maco	krummaluf	then go to gnome-look
2009-10-26T10:32:00.000Z	maco	krummaluf	id switch to kde then ;)
2009-10-26T10:33:00.000Z	maco	krummaluf	sure. apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
2009-10-26T10:33:00.000Z	maco	krummaluf	you can use kde apps in gnome and gnome apps in kde

2009-10-26T10:46:00.000Z	maco	krummaluf	good for you?
2009-10-26T10:46:00.000Z	maco	krummaluf	the first user in ubuntu isnt root...and there is no root password...so usually youd have to sudo unless you set a password for root and then logged in as it
2009-10-26T10:47:00.000Z	maco	krummaluf	then you didnt run anything as root
2009-10-26T10:47:00.000Z	maco	krummaluf	youhave to tell sudo what you want to run
2009-10-26T10:47:00.000Z	maco	krummaluf	otherwise it just doesnt do anything
2009-10-26T10:51:00.000Z	maco	krummaluf	could you use a word other than sexy? because if you keep using that word, i expect playboy/playgirl models will be suggested
2009-10-26T10:52:00.000Z	maco	krummaluf	pretty? shiny? dark? bright? colourful?
2009-10-26T10:53:00.000Z	krummaluf	maco	dark
2009-10-26T10:53:00.000Z	maco	krummaluf	oh! right so in kde there's a thing called Get Hot New Stuff. itll let you browse themes and download them 1-click install
