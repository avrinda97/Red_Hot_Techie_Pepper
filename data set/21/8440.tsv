2006-04-04T15:45:00.000Z	deque	soc10path	It has the s1 and s2 switches, though I don't use them, I seem to recall being surprised that they did stuff.. The wireless switch works fine as it's hardware based
2006-04-04T15:46:00.000Z	soc10path	deque	good to know, i have a FE
2006-04-04T15:48:00.000Z	deque	soc10path	I just tried out my "P1" and "P2" buttons
2006-04-04T15:49:00.000Z	soc10path	deque	good to know
2006-04-04T15:49:00.000Z	soc10path	deque	Gustaf's backlight FN+Fx doesn't work, that's hardware based too right?
2006-04-04T15:50:00.000Z	deque	soc10path	I don't think so, IIRC, you need the sony tools installed. I did when I was running Gentoo at least, presumably Dapper automagically installed them already...
2006-04-04T15:50:00.000Z	deque	soc10path	 hm, nope, they aren't installed.
2006-04-04T15:51:00.000Z	deque	soc10path	 I've also noticed some support for sony- specific hardware in recent kernels, that may have something to do with it.
2006-04-04T15:52:00.000Z	soc10path	deque	i saw that too, some of it was sound related
2006-04-04T15:53:00.000Z	deque	soc10path	 I'm pretty sure they aren't purely hardware (BIOS) based like the old models were.
2006-04-04T15:53:00.000Z	soc10path	deque	every other laptop i've ever had (that i can think of) was pure hardware based
2006-04-04T15:53:00.000Z	soc10path	deque	i find it hard to believe, but i wouldn't put it past sony
2006-04-04T15:54:00.000Z	deque	soc10path	 They didn't work on this machine whne I first got it. Took a lot of fiddling when I was running gentoo to make them cooperate. And on my old 505 they worked with no config
2006-04-04T15:55:00.000Z	deque	soc10path	sounds good
2006-04-05T16:17:00.000Z	soc10path	deque	still here?
2006-04-05T16:19:00.000Z	deque	soc10path	yeah
2006-04-05T16:22:00.000Z	deque	soc10path	I am back
2006-04-05T16:22:00.000Z	soc10path	deque	does your vaio have a webcam built in?
2006-04-05T16:22:00.000Z	deque	soc10path	nope
2006-04-05T16:23:00.000Z	soc10path	deque	ah, ok
