2006-10-17T16:57:00.000Z	henna		meep, how cna get the dialogue to configure X? X got screwed up by a half finished upgrade
2006-10-17T07:54:00.000Z	henna		mm some kind of progressmeter would be nice for apt-get dist-upgrade
2006-10-17T07:55:00.000Z	henna		mm
2006-10-17T07:55:00.000Z	henna		does that work from the commandline?
2006-10-17T07:55:00.000Z	henna		(console even more specificly
2006-10-17T07:55:00.000Z	henna		)
2006-10-17T07:55:00.000Z	henna		so no use for me :(
2006-10-17T07:56:00.000Z	henna		somebody already asked me if I could get the search from apt to output like gentoo's portage
2006-10-17T07:56:00.000Z	henna		I could learn python with it
2006-10-17T07:57:00.000Z	kmaynard	henna	apt-cache search foo
2006-10-17T07:57:00.000Z	kmaynard		oh, nevermind
2006-10-17T07:57:00.000Z	henna	kmaynard	outputs  stuff htat's far too complicated to read :)
2006-10-17T07:57:00.000Z	kmaynard		you want it to look like portage
2006-10-17T07:58:00.000Z	kmaynard	henna	complicated?! it gives you the package name and description
2006-10-17T07:58:00.000Z	henna		not necessarily like portage, but a lsightly beter understandable output
2006-10-17T07:58:00.000Z	kmaynard	henna	try apt-cache search gaim
2006-10-17T07:58:00.000Z	henna	kmaynard	yes and no indentation at all, no colors, just plain flat text
2006-10-17T07:58:00.000Z	kmaynard	henna	http://packages.ubuntu.com/
2006-10-17T07:59:00.000Z	henna	kmaynard	to slow :)
2006-10-17T07:59:00.000Z	henna		should tackle it as soon as I manage to get this tellicoo script running
2006-10-17T08:00:00.000Z	kmaynard	henna	www.gentoo.org
