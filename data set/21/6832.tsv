2008-01-24T08:04:00.000Z	unop	chalcedony	 what is dcc?
2008-01-24T08:04:00.000Z	chalcedony	unop	i want to send the file to a friend via irc
2008-03-28T03:04:00.000Z	chalcedony	unop	nice explanation
2008-06-27T23:32:00.000Z	unop	chalcedony	probably also worthwhile running.   sudo aptitude install -f

2008-07-07T11:50:00.000Z	chalcedony	unop	~$  xrandr  #
2008-07-07T11:58:00.000Z	unop	chalcedony	so what's the problem?  fonts in xchat?
2008-07-07T11:58:00.000Z	chalcedony	unop	i think it's more likely screen resolution than just Xchat fonts
2008-07-07T11:59:00.000Z	unop	chalcedony	is it just xchat that you have problems with - kinda hard to ascertain from the screenshot
2008-07-07T12:00:00.000Z	chalcedony	unop	xchat and open office .. just the letters are lighter and more vague, punctuation got less obvious, i can't tell , from .  or ; from :
2008-07-07T12:03:00.000Z	chalcedony	unop	if you are lookng at the screenshot, the copy of the Xchat on the left is the one i tried to *improve* the font on, i can't stand to look at it
2008-07-07T12:04:00.000Z	chalcedony	unop	click and it gets full sized, then you can (sort of) see what i mean
2008-07-07T12:04:00.000Z	unop	chalcedony	can't you choose a slightly lower resolution?
2008-07-07T12:04:00.000Z	chalcedony	unop	how?
2008-07-07T12:04:00.000Z	unop	chalcedony	gnome-display-properties i think
2008-07-07T12:05:00.000Z	unop	chalcedony	 eh? are you serious? :)
2008-07-07T12:05:00.000Z	unop	chalcedony	 1024x1024 < 1024x7668
2008-07-07T12:05:00.000Z	chalcedony	unop	er it's numbers? and where is 'gnome' ?
2008-07-07T12:06:00.000Z	unop	chalcedony	err, sorry, that was 768
