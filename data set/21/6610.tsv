2009-03-22T04:58:00.000Z	Stephan	crdlb	how do i automatically "use" a driver ?
2009-03-22T04:58:00.000Z	crdlb	Stephan	uh, what kind of driver?
2009-03-22T04:59:00.000Z	Stephan	crdlb	its a wireless driver.
2009-03-22T04:59:00.000Z	Stephan	crdlb	when i start my system, i need to goto system, admin, hardware drivers.   itll show the driver 'activated but not in use'
2009-03-22T04:59:00.000Z	crdlb	Stephan	you have no ethernet access?
2009-03-22T05:00:00.000Z	crdlb	Stephan	what's the name of the driver you see in hardware drivers?
2009-03-22T05:00:00.000Z	Stephan	crdlb	nope, wireless works fine ... i just have to enable it manually
2009-03-22T05:00:00.000Z	Stephan	crdlb	it's broadcom sta wireless driver
2009-03-22T05:01:00.000Z	crdlb	Stephan	so by 'enable it manually', you mean modprobe?
2009-03-22T05:01:00.000Z	Stephan	crdlb	no, i click deactivate, then activate  and it works .. i guess it's doing modprobe in the background?
2009-03-22T05:02:00.000Z	crdlb	Stephan	hmm, it sounds like some alternate driver (ie kernel module) is loading, which is breaking the one in hardware drivers, but that's just a guess
2009-03-22T05:03:00.000Z	Stephan	crdlb	so how would i fix this?
2009-03-22T05:03:00.000Z	Stephan	crdlb	its the hardware manager .. its not any added package.  its what came with ubuntu
2009-03-22T05:04:00.000Z	crdlb	Stephan	yeah, but it's probably part of linux-restricted-modules, whereas some open source driver is used by default (that apparently doesn't work)
2009-03-22T05:04:00.000Z	Stephan	crdlb	how do i change the default drivers then?
2009-03-22T05:05:00.000Z	crdlb	Stephan	what's the exact chipset? you can look at lspci to check
2009-03-22T05:06:00.000Z	Stephan	crdlb	3:08.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM43XG (rev 01)
2009-03-22T05:08:00.000Z	crdlb	Stephan	ok, here's what I'd do: run lsmod > working_modules; then reboot and run lsmod > broken_modules
2009-03-22T05:08:00.000Z	crdlb	Stephan	then you can diff working_modules broken_modules
2009-03-22T05:09:00.000Z	Stephan	crdlb	ok.  and once i find the difference in the files,  then where do i modify the loading files?
2009-03-22T05:09:00.000Z	crdlb	Stephan	you can blacklist any broadcom driver you see in broken but not in working
