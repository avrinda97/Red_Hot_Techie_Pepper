2008-06-21T01:58:00.000Z	ipei		Can someone help me with nvidia drivers and "Ubuntu is running in low graph mode"? Please
2008-06-21T02:00:00.000Z	ipei		a, did you mean "ipei"? :)
2008-06-21T02:00:00.000Z	ipei		al*
2008-06-21T02:02:00.000Z	ipei		al, Yes I wan't to run in high graphics mode. :)
2008-06-21T02:02:00.000Z	a1	ipei	yes
2008-06-21T02:02:00.000Z	ipei		al, sorry. Didn't see you msg. But, yes, I want to run in high graphic mode.
2008-06-21T02:03:00.000Z	a1	ipei	  goto System>Preferance>Apearance>Visual effects and chose the one u want
2008-06-21T02:04:00.000Z	ipei		al, But the problÃ¶em is that I can't enable nvidias accelerated driver. If I do so Ubuntu just start in "Low graph mode" and I need to reset my xorg.conf file via recoverymode
2008-06-21T02:06:00.000Z	a1	ipei	have u gone to system>administration>hardware drivers ?
2008-06-21T02:06:00.000Z	ipei		Yes. But the thing was that I was stupid enough to try the drivers from nvidias site >.<. So now I can't enable it.
2008-06-21T02:09:00.000Z	a1		test
2008-06-21T02:10:00.000Z	ipei		al, I just tested to start ubuntu with the older kernel number or something in the grub menu... It worked with that. I believe that the nvidia driver did something strange...
2008-06-21T02:11:00.000Z	ipei		al, I don't really know the difference between the chooices in the menu... But the previous worked... But How can I solve that?
2008-06-21T02:12:00.000Z	a1		hang on....
2008-06-21T02:12:00.000Z	ipei	nickrud	Sorry, I didn't really get it... Reinstall what? :/
2008-06-21T02:13:00.000Z	ipei	nickrud	I did install it after the update of the kernel. So, :'/
2008-06-21T02:15:00.000Z	ipei	nickrud	Ok. But now I can only start ubuntu (with good graphics) in the previous KERNEL. wHAT SHOULD i DO?
2008-06-21T02:15:00.000Z	ipei	nickrud	Sorry for the caps...
2008-06-21T02:16:00.000Z	ipei	nickrud	Because as it is now the latest kernel will be "auto started"...
2008-06-21T02:18:00.000Z	ipei	nickrud	Yeah, ok. (This one was the third in the list, yeah :)) But will it be "auto solved" when they reales a new kenel version?
2008-06-21T02:19:00.000Z	a1	ipei	goto synaptic package manager... look for nvidia... choose the generic modules you need.
