2009-01-08T06:20:00.000Z	tbrock		hey guys, is there a problem with flash-nonfree? my firefox constantly turns black and unresponsive and its very very slow when displaying any sort of flash
2009-01-08T06:20:00.000Z	tbrock		anything i can do to fix this, or is this a known problem
2009-01-08T06:21:00.000Z	gogereaver	tbrock	thats normaly in the extras package
2009-01-08T06:21:00.000Z	tbrock	gogereaver	what do yu mean
2009-01-08T06:22:00.000Z	gogereaver	tbrock	ubuntu restricted extras
2009-01-08T06:22:00.000Z	gogereaver	tbrock	that comes with flash and java
2009-01-08T06:22:00.000Z	tbrock	gogereaver	sorry i'm not understanding
2009-01-08T06:22:00.000Z	tbrock		I installed flash-nonfree, and you are saying that i should not have because it is a restricted extra
2009-01-08T06:22:00.000Z	tbrock		?
2009-01-08T06:23:00.000Z	gogereaver	tbrock	it comes in the extra package set installing it alone is a bit dated
2009-01-08T06:24:00.000Z	tbrock	gogereaver	ah, so i should uninstall and then install ubuntu-extras
2009-01-08T06:24:00.000Z	tbrock		what is the exact package name?
2009-01-08T06:24:00.000Z	gogereaver	tbrock	ubuntu-restricted-extras yep
2009-01-08T06:24:00.000Z	gogereaver	tbrock	that will also install java
2009-01-08T06:25:00.000Z	tbrock		ok, i don't seem to see how this is any different than just installing it on its own, why is that dated?
2009-01-08T06:26:00.000Z	tbrock	gogereaver	i'm cool with java, but i just wanted to know why the other way, with just one package is outdated, it should be the same
2009-01-08T06:29:00.000Z	gogereaver	tbrock	acully the set downloads it from flash directly and configurs it for ubuntu
2009-01-08T06:29:00.000Z	tbrock	gogereaver	ok, cool
2009-01-08T06:29:00.000Z	gogereaver		tbroc non-free is a older deb package
2009-01-08T06:30:00.000Z	tbrock	gogereaver	bummer that it isn't maintained
2009-01-08T06:30:00.000Z	tbrock	gogereaver	ok right when i installed it it took away my battery icon on my laptop
