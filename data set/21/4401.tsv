2008-05-09T23:34:00.000Z	xomp	GhostFish_	is it a radeon card?

2008-05-09T23:37:00.000Z	xomp	GhostFish_	ok, in the terminal type  sudo gedit /etc/drircd
2008-05-09T23:38:00.000Z	GhostFish_	xomp	: Ok its still blank
2008-05-09T23:38:00.000Z	xomp	GhostFish_	put the text I have here http://pastebin.com/m2c091502 in the blank space then save the file
2008-05-09T23:42:00.000Z	xomp	GhostFish_	Once done, just close out of gedit and just to make sure it saved correctly, in the terminal type  sudo gedit /etc/drircd again and let me know if the text is all there.
2008-05-09T23:43:00.000Z	GhostFish_	xomp	yeap
2008-05-09T23:43:00.000Z	xomp	GhostFish_	ok, you should be good to go, just restart X by using CTRL+ALT+BACKSPACE or logout and login :)
2008-05-09T23:49:00.000Z	xomp	GhostFish_	any luck?
2008-05-09T23:49:00.000Z	GhostFish_	xomp	nope
2008-05-09T23:49:00.000Z	xomp	GhostFish_	do you have CCSM installed?
2008-05-09T23:50:00.000Z	xomp	GhostFish_	ahh, ok.. the /etc/drircd trick should have worked. Try asking in #compiz
2008-05-09T23:50:00.000Z	xomp	GhostFish_	I too have a radeon and the /etc/drircd trick works a treat! I'm not sure why it's not working for you mate.
2008-05-09T23:51:00.000Z	xomp	GhostFish_	curious, did you restart the PC?
2008-05-09T23:52:00.000Z	xomp	GhostFish_	restarting X like that should have worked. Try rebooting if you can spare the downtime for sheets and geegles :)
