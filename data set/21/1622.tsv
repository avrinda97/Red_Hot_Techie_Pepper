2010-06-30T03:34:00.000Z	Shadowsong		Hello
2010-06-30T03:36:00.000Z	Shadowsong		I've been reading various sites on web hosting servers. I've been wondering why they always tell you that you "have to" install a dns server?
2010-06-30T03:38:00.000Z	Shadowsong		anyone know?
2010-06-30T03:40:00.000Z	Shadowsong		I just don't get why you would need a dns server for a web hosting server.
2010-06-30T03:41:00.000Z	Dulak	Shadowsong	how would domain->ip mapping happen without dns?
2010-06-30T03:41:00.000Z	Shadowsong		through the domain you buy from somewhere like godaddy.com
2010-06-30T03:42:00.000Z	Dulak	Shadowsong	domain registration is not the same as dns
2010-06-30T03:42:00.000Z	Shadowsong		buy domain, assign to your ip
2010-06-30T03:42:00.000Z	Dulak	Shadowsong	my registrar charges for dns on top of the domain
2010-06-30T03:43:00.000Z	Dulak	Shadowsong	the docs you are reading are aimed at isp type setups, if dns is handled you don't need bind
2010-06-30T03:44:00.000Z	Shadowsong	Dulak	huh?
2010-06-30T03:45:00.000Z	Dulak	Shadowsong	I will say that a large majority of providers handle thier own dns though.  It does not look professional to sell hosting where you can't also handle dns
2010-06-30T03:45:00.000Z	Shadowsong		why?
2010-06-30T03:45:00.000Z	Dulak	Shadowsong	are you wanting to just host your own sites or resell hosting?
2010-06-30T03:45:00.000Z	Shadowsong		i still don't see a reason to run a dns server
2010-06-30T03:46:00.000Z	Shadowsong		resell hosting
2010-06-30T03:46:00.000Z	Dulak	Shadowsong	dns is not the same as registering a domain, it's seperate
2010-06-30T03:47:00.000Z	Shadowsong		so why do i need a dns server for web hosting?
2010-06-30T03:47:00.000Z	Dulak	Shadowsong	as a provider
2010-06-30T03:47:00.000Z	Dulak	Shadowsong	so domains will resolve
2010-06-30T03:49:00.000Z	Dulak	Shadowsong	I think you need to read up on how dns works.  If you want to sell hosting you will also be running dns for your customers, as that's an expected feature of hosting
