2008-07-16T22:23:00.000Z	Xavura		People my driver seems to be broken and I'm getting segmentation faults, I need some help
2008-07-16T22:23:00.000Z	Xavura		Graphics card driver
2008-07-16T22:24:00.000Z	Xavura		When running glxinfo I am getting errors and segmentation faults, anyone?
2008-07-16T22:25:00.000Z	Xavura		glxinfo is giving me errors and segmentation faults
2008-07-16T22:27:00.000Z	Xavura		I'm assuming segmentation faults are bad, if so I have a big problem right?
2008-07-16T22:28:00.000Z	Xavura		Let me rephrase. Are segmentation faults bad? If so HOW bad......
2008-07-16T22:28:00.000Z	tuna-fish	Xavura	Segmentation fault = linux kills a process because that process attempted to use memory it's not allowed to.
2008-07-16T22:28:00.000Z	Xavura	tuna-fish	Why would glxinfo use memory it isn't allowed to?
2008-07-16T22:29:00.000Z	tuna-fish	Xavura	it means the programmer made a mistake
2008-07-16T22:29:00.000Z	Xavura	tuna-fish	Isn't glxinfo built into err Linux/Ubuntu?
2008-07-16T22:30:00.000Z	tuna-fish	Xavura	You get a segfault when, for example, you try to access the 11th item of a 10-item array. (and the memory after it is not segmented for writing/reading)
2008-07-16T22:32:00.000Z	tuna-fish	Xavura	drivers probably not loading up correctly. Which brand?
2008-07-16T22:32:00.000Z	Xavura	tuna-fish	ATI
2008-07-16T22:32:00.000Z	tuna-fish	Xavura	Ca't help, I have no experience with them
2008-07-16T22:33:00.000Z	tuna-fish	Xavura	Also, did you update your kernel lately?
2008-07-16T22:33:00.000Z	tuna-fish	Xavura	have you rebooted your machine since?
2008-07-16T22:33:00.000Z	Xavura	tuna-fish	Not that I know of
2008-07-16T22:34:00.000Z	tuna-fish	Xavura	there was an update on the apt repo not long ago, perhaps you installed it. That would make the drivers not work until the machine is rebooted once.
2008-07-16T22:34:00.000Z	Xavura	tuna-fish	See above, I have restarted numerous times
2008-07-16T22:35:00.000Z	tuna-fish	Xavura	I'd try reinstalling the drivers
2008-07-16T22:35:00.000Z	tuna-fish	Xavura	segfault just means the software is crashing and linux kills it to save itself from it.
