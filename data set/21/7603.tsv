2008-03-11T08:15:00.000Z	unique		im a newbie n i need help am i in the right place?
2008-03-11T08:16:00.000Z	unique		i have a creative xfi how do i go about installing the drivers?
2008-03-11T08:16:00.000Z	unique		i downloaded the linux drivers
2008-03-11T08:17:00.000Z	unique		im fluent in windows
2008-03-11T08:17:00.000Z	macogw	unique	windows knowledge isnt the least bit helpful here
2008-03-11T08:18:00.000Z	macogw	unique	it doesnt work on its own?  most drivers are built into the kernel
2008-03-11T08:19:00.000Z	macogw	unique	double click to untar it, and there should be a readme
2008-03-11T08:21:00.000Z	macogw	unique	sudo aptitude install build-essential
2008-03-11T08:21:00.000Z	macogw	unique	that's the first step to compiling drivers
2008-03-11T08:23:00.000Z	macogw	unique	which card is it exactly?
2008-03-11T08:24:00.000Z	macogw	unique	creative x-fi, which?
2008-03-11T08:28:00.000Z	macogw	unique	well that's a known troublesome card...ok all creative wireles is known to be kinda crap on linux...im not sure how to do it other than follow the directions.  you probably need to install linux-headers for one thing
2008-03-11T08:29:00.000Z	macogw	unique	if you wouldnt mind, could you try booting from a live cd of the development version and seeing if it works there?  there was a sound overhaul this release, so i'm curious.  if it doesn't, you can file a bug against it to try to get it fixed by release.  i'm not recommending installing it though.  it's not stable enough for beginners to use yet.
2008-03-11T08:30:00.000Z	macogw	unique	yes
2008-03-11T08:30:00.000Z	macogw	unique	"sudo ./install"
2008-03-11T08:30:00.000Z	macogw	unique	you have to be in the directory where it is
2008-03-11T08:30:00.000Z	macogw	unique	but you need to have the compilers (build-essential) and header files (linux-headers) installed first
2008-03-11T08:32:00.000Z	macogw	unique	after you have the stuff needed to be able to run it, yes
2008-03-11T08:33:00.000Z	macogw	unique	build-essential and linux-headers, as ive said 3 times
2008-03-11T08:37:00.000Z	macogw	unique	you can get them from synaptic (system -> administration -> synaptic)
2008-03-11T08:41:00.000Z	macogw	unique	there should be one just called linux-headers that should pull in whatever matches your current version
