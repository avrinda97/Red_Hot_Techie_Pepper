2007-12-10T19:48:00.000Z	Tyczek		is anybody have that problem : enabled compiz and mplayer= movie is blinking?
2007-12-10T19:50:00.000Z	_coredump_	Tyczek	yes, disable Xv video rendering to x11 in mplayer preferences
2007-12-10T19:51:00.000Z	Tyczek	_coredump_	I'm using gl2, cause on full screen movie looks better
2007-12-10T19:51:00.000Z	Tyczek		i have wide lcd-laptop screen ;/
2007-12-10T19:51:00.000Z	_coredump_	Tyczek	nvidia or ati graphics?
2007-12-10T19:51:00.000Z	Tyczek		ati ;/
2007-12-10T19:53:00.000Z	_coredump_	Tyczek	its a known bug with compiz, you have to switch to x11 video output, mplayer or gstreamer-settings if you are using gstreamer-player
2007-12-10T19:53:00.000Z	Tyczek	_coredump_	ok I'll test
2007-12-10T19:54:00.000Z	_coredump_	Tyczek	or disable compiz effects and use the default desktop setting, thats should work too
2007-12-10T19:56:00.000Z	Tyczek	_coredump_	It only works on ximage/shm, but in full-screen image is scalling and setting center... i think disabling compiz and the movie-time is the best option right?
2007-12-10T19:56:00.000Z	Tyczek		at*
2007-12-10T19:57:00.000Z	_coredump_	Tyczek	yes think thats the best option
2007-12-10T19:57:00.000Z	Tyczek		and last question... wchich is output is better- gl or gl2?
2007-12-10T19:58:00.000Z	_coredump_	Tyczek	on my system switching to the latest nvidia drivers fixed the problem...dunno if there are ati-betas available
2007-12-10T19:58:00.000Z	Tyczek	_coredump_	I think there isn't betas ;/
2007-12-10T19:58:00.000Z	Tyczek		arent*
2007-12-10T19:58:00.000Z	_coredump_	Tyczek	ati and linux is still a mess
2007-12-10T19:59:00.000Z	Tyczek	_coredump_	Yeah... but I think it'll change... I can't switch to my crt monitor...
2007-12-10T19:59:00.000Z	Tyczek		It is messing my xorg...
