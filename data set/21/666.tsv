2011-11-07T21:28:00.000Z	milen8204	urlin2u	I said Any one familiar whit the program docky ?? you said milen8204, pretty much whats up. then I asked urlin2u, did you try to work whit it on new gnome-shell
2011-11-07T21:29:00.000Z	urlin2u	milen8204	sorry lol no I doubt the gnome shell is the place for it the bottom, top, right and left parts of the screen are already moving.
2011-11-07T21:30:00.000Z	urlin2u	milen8204	the top is stationary but the screen changes to access stuff in gnome 3.
2011-11-07T21:31:00.000Z	milen8204	urlin2u	I cant active intelligent hide expanded effect and more options in gnome 3
2011-11-07T21:34:00.000Z	urlin2u	milen8204	not sure what you mean I would look on the web, gnome 3 can be tweaked but you would have to go into the controlling files it is not a click and fix sort of situation as far as I know, your not being real specific here as well.
2011-11-07T21:35:00.000Z	milen8204	urlin2u	 How I cant set up the gnome panel and Docky in gnome3 ?
2011-11-07T21:36:00.000Z	urlin2u	milen8204	I don't think it is worth it to be honest.
2011-11-07T23:21:00.000Z	urlin2u	milen8204	you don't really want to remove unity, it is actually a plugin in compiz it is rather small, and messing with removing it really isn't in your best interests, unless your like really OCD.

2011-11-07T23:24:00.000Z	urlin2u	milen8204	some suggest just unticking the unity-plugin in the compizconfig manager do at your own risk.
2011-11-07T23:25:00.000Z	urlin2u	milen8204	I use docky on the bottom as well, never unticked the unity though.
2011-11-07T23:25:00.000Z	milen8204	urlin2u	what could happen if I try ? :D
2011-11-07T23:26:00.000Z	milen8204	urlin2u	I dont like the Unity plugin I would like to use gnome panels
2011-11-07T23:26:00.000Z	urlin2u	milen8204	not sure bit the refresh rate of compiz is not good in natty and beyond, Basically evrytime I have seen that advice it has a at your own risk attached.
2011-11-07T23:26:00.000Z	milen8204	urlin2u	I am whit 11.10
2011-11-07T23:27:00.000Z	urlin2u	milen8204	you can turn it back on though I think in the 2d unity or the classic natty and beyond means later releases.
2011-11-07T23:28:00.000Z	milen8204	urlin2u	ok I choose classic
