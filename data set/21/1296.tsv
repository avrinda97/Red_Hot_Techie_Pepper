2010-11-10T06:00:00.000Z	jrt4		I just did a clean reinstall of Ubuntu (10.04 --> 10.10). Every time I do heavy CPU intensive work, I experience sudden shutdowns (this generally happens with overheating). But everything was working fine in 10.04 for months, so I doubt a hardware problem suddenly occured right after a reinstall. It seems that the default ACPI configuration is screwed up somehow. How should I go about fixing this?
2010-11-10T06:01:00.000Z	jrt4		(Thanks, by the way)
2010-11-10T06:03:00.000Z	jrt4		That bug report seems to be dealing with something else.
2010-11-10T06:04:00.000Z	ectospasm	jrt4	right, the bug isn't about shutting down.  Check your temperature gauges
2010-11-10T06:04:00.000Z	jrt4	ectospasm	As I said -- it seems like it is overheating. My question is why. It wasn't happening at all prior to the upgrade.
2010-11-10T06:04:00.000Z	ectospasm	jrt4	look into lm_sensors
2010-11-10T06:04:00.000Z	jrt4		The upgrade didn't magically fill my fans with cathair.
2010-11-10T06:05:00.000Z	jrt4		Something must be screwed in ACPI.
2010-11-10T06:05:00.000Z	ectospasm	jrt4	could be a driver for a sensor changed, and you've uncovered a bug.
2010-11-10T06:05:00.000Z	jrt4	ectospasm	OK. How would I diagnose this so that I can file a useful bug report. I'm not seeing anything in the logs.
2010-11-10T06:06:00.000Z	ectospasm	jrt4	like I said, look into lm_sensors logs.  I haven't looked into them in some time
2010-11-10T06:06:00.000Z	ectospasm	jrt4	... so I don't know where to guide you
2010-11-10T06:06:00.000Z	jrt4	ectospasm	Oh, sorry. I missed when you said that. I'll take a look. Thanks a bunch.
2010-11-10T06:10:00.000Z	jrt4	ectospasm	I don't have an lm_sensors log file and none of the system log files (syslog, messages, kern.log) have anything related to lm_sensors in them. Any other suggestions?
2010-11-10T06:11:00.000Z	ectospasm	jrt4	nope, sorry
2010-11-10T06:11:00.000Z	jrt4		(Searches for "temp" and "thermal"  also aren't turning anything up ...)(
2010-11-10T06:11:00.000Z	ectospasm	jrt4	maybe find the time of the last boot in messages or syslog, and find that
2010-11-10T06:11:00.000Z	jrt4	ectospasm	That was the first thing I did, and there is nothing.
2010-11-10T06:12:00.000Z	ectospasm	jrt4	out of luck then
2010-11-10T06:12:00.000Z	jrt4	ectospasm	Should I use sleeping pills or a plastic grocery bag?
2010-11-10T06:12:00.000Z	ectospasm	jrt4	razor blades, so much more emo
