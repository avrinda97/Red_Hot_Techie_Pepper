2009-12-17T07:11:00.000Z	smacnay		Seems I am running hardy...
2009-12-17T07:12:00.000Z	DasEi	smacnay	lsb_release -a tells you
2009-12-17T07:14:00.000Z	smacnay	DasEi	got it - now I need the actual command name for the "software sources" option... to run from command line.
2009-12-17T07:18:00.000Z	DasEi	smacnay	sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2009-12-17T07:18:00.000Z	smacnay	DasEi	that doesn't take me from 8.04 LTS to 8.09, does it?
2009-12-17T07:19:00.000Z	DasEi	smacnay	that would go 8.04 >> 9.04
2009-12-17T07:19:00.000Z	DasEi	smacnay	that would go 8.04 >> 8.10,, sorry me too
2009-12-17T07:20:00.000Z	DasEi	smacnay	you allways go one distro 8.04,8.10,9.04,9.10 (current)
2009-12-17T07:22:00.000Z	smacnay	DasEi	but aptitude dist-upgrade will not do that will it?
2009-12-17T07:22:00.000Z	DasEi	smacnay	yes one at a time
2009-12-17T07:28:00.000Z	smacnay	DasEi	I ran dist-upgrade and am still in 8.04 after a reboot.
2009-12-17T07:31:00.000Z	DasEi	smacnay	sudo do-release-update  ,and note the ssh port
2009-12-17T07:34:00.000Z	smacnay	DasEi	hmmm, "no new release found"... must need to change my apt sources??
2009-12-17T07:36:00.000Z	DasEi	smacnay	some changes in there, scroll down the page : http://www.howtoforge.com/how-to-upgrade-ubuntu-8.04-to-ubuntu-8.10-desktop-and-server
2009-12-17T07:36:00.000Z	DasEi	smacnay	I never did it with hardy, the following, ibex and so on, are more flawless
2009-12-17T07:37:00.000Z	smacnay	DasEi	I needed to run the software-properties-gtk and change the "LTS only" option to something else.
2009-12-17T07:38:00.000Z	DasEi	smacnay	if it was set
2009-12-17T07:38:00.000Z	smacnay	DasEi	got it now
2009-12-17T07:39:00.000Z	DasEi	smacnay	so look foward, ibex from hardy is a nice jump
2009-12-17T07:39:00.000Z	DasEi	smacnay	also you updated/graded hardy before ?
2009-12-17T07:40:00.000Z	DasEi	smacnay	this is a pure server ?
