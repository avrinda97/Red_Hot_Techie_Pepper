2007-06-15T09:23:00.000Z	Master_Z		Sound isnt working on my ubuntu, do I need linux drivers for these ?
2007-06-15T09:24:00.000Z	necro	Master_Z	what kinda card?
2007-06-15T09:25:00.000Z	necro	Master_Z	you can try going into the AlSA mixer and muting the optical inputs and outputs.  That's worked for me now twice on two different linux's.
2007-06-15T09:25:00.000Z	necro	Master_Z	run "alsamixer" at a command prompt
2007-06-15T09:26:00.000Z	necro	Master_Z	Go to applications -> accessories -> terminal
2007-06-15T09:30:00.000Z	necro	Master_Z	try going most of the way to the right and look for anything "optical", then hit M to mute them.
2007-06-15T09:32:00.000Z	necro	Master_Z	go most of the way to the right and look for anything optical.  Hit M on them to mute them.  It helps if you have a sound playing to see if it works.
2007-06-15T09:33:00.000Z	necro	Master_Z	it would say optical in the top left of the screen.  The actual slider wouldn't be labeled optical.
2007-06-15T09:34:00.000Z	necro	Master_Z	yep
2007-06-15T09:35:00.000Z	necro	Master_Z	it may be that you don't have any optical inputs.  It would say it on the 4th line from the top, where it sez Item:.  You don't see anything that sez optical when you move between the sliders?
2007-06-15T09:37:00.000Z	necro	Master_Z	Like I said, mine sez "IEC958 Optical".  Make sure it's muted.  It has killed my sound on two different distros.
2007-06-15T09:38:00.000Z	necro	Master_Z	only anything labeled as optical.  :P
