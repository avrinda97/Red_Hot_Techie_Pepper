2010-06-28T11:32:00.000Z	miica		hello, looking for some support :P
2010-06-28T11:33:00.000Z	miica		When i login in GDM it just shows black screen and gets back in gdm login screen
2010-06-28T11:34:00.000Z	IConrad01	miica	Can you log in to command line w/ the recovery option?
2010-06-28T11:34:00.000Z	miica	IConrad01	yeah
2010-06-28T11:35:00.000Z	miica	IConrad01	i am in console atm
2010-06-28T11:35:00.000Z	miica	IConrad01	also rested xorg configs to low reso but still no
2010-06-28T11:36:00.000Z	IConrad01	miica	Actually that's sounding like an error w/ GNOME,  not Xorg.
2010-06-28T11:36:00.000Z	IConrad01	miica	Can you re-install GNOME maybe?
2010-06-28T11:36:00.000Z	IConrad01	miica	Actually, first, try making a new user and seeing if the problem persists across logins.
2010-06-28T11:37:00.000Z	miica	IConrad01	tried it and didint work
2010-06-28T11:37:00.000Z	miica	IConrad01	it also says there isnt default session set
2010-06-28T11:38:00.000Z	IConrad01	miica	Try the new user route.  Short of that, from GDM you should be able to set defaults for your session w/o logging in first.
2010-06-28T11:38:00.000Z	miica	IConrad01	there wasnt any session options in my GDM :/
2010-06-28T11:40:00.000Z	IConrad01	miica	What's in your gdm.conf file?
2010-06-28T11:41:00.000Z	miica	IConrad01	where that conf is :o
2010-06-28T11:42:00.000Z	IConrad01	miica	/etc/init/gdm.conf
2010-06-28T11:42:00.000Z	miica	IConrad01	dont have it thats why didint find it :D
2010-06-28T11:43:00.000Z	IConrad01	miica	Well, that sounds like it's the issue right there.
2010-06-28T11:43:00.000Z	miica	IConrad01	yeah i think so too where i get new conf :P
2010-06-28T11:45:00.000Z	miica	IConrad01	can you link "raw" version link
2010-06-28T13:17:00.000Z	miica	IConrad01	found problem.. i removed totem earlier so it removed gnome to..
