2011-08-27T22:52:00.000Z	yeats	j3f3s0N	how did you install?
2011-08-27T22:53:00.000Z	yeats	j3f3s0N	so you added a PPA or something?
2011-08-27T22:54:00.000Z	yeats	j3f3s0N	so what steps have you taken to try and uninstall?
2011-08-27T22:55:00.000Z	yeats	j3f3s0N	have you disabled the PPA?
2011-08-27T23:00:00.000Z	yeats	j3f3s0N	from the Software Center, go to Edit -> Software Sources..., then make sure that the mozilla daily PPA is unchecked
2011-08-27T23:01:00.000Z	j3f3s0N	yeats	I go try
2011-08-27T23:01:00.000Z	yeats	j3f3s0N	(under the Other Software tab)
2011-08-27T23:03:00.000Z	j3f3s0N	yeats	I removed all Firefox
2011-08-27T23:04:00.000Z	yeats	j3f3s0N	you mean you unchecked the software sources entries?
2011-08-27T23:04:00.000Z	j3f3s0N	yeats	yes
2011-08-27T23:04:00.000Z	j3f3s0N	yeats	is unchecked
2011-08-27T23:05:00.000Z	yeats	j3f3s0N	okay - can you open a terminal and enter 'dpkg -l | grep firefox', pastebin the output and share the link?
2011-08-27T23:07:00.000Z	j3f3s0N	yeats	$ dpkg -l | grep firefox
2011-08-27T23:08:00.000Z	j3f3s0N	yeats	the command shows this
2011-08-27T23:08:00.000Z	yeats	j3f3s0N	try 'sudo apt-get remove firefox', then 'sudo apt-get install firefox'
