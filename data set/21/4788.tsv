2008-02-12T20:20:00.000Z	Tiven		im getting lag spikes sometimes with my usb wireless mouse , usually when browsing websites with Firefox
2008-02-12T20:21:00.000Z	Tiven		like the  mouse stucks for: from 10ms to 200ms
2008-02-12T20:23:00.000Z	Tiven		what do you mean bazhang ? ^_^
2008-02-12T20:24:00.000Z	bazhang	Tiven	if it is the mouse then it should be laggy with not just firefox though--would this be on *flash* sites with firefox?
2008-02-12T20:25:00.000Z	Tiven	bazhang	no i dont think so. i think it usually happens when i have a lot of tabs open ( on firefox ) or many apps running ( it doesnt happen only with firefox )
2008-02-12T20:26:00.000Z	Tiven	bazhang	it just happened while hovering one of my bars' icon and im only running konversation irc client at the moment :(
2008-02-12T20:26:00.000Z	Tiven	bazhang	2gb ram , with firefox it happens with 5 or 7 + tabs
2008-02-12T20:33:00.000Z	Tiven	bazhang	doesnt noacpi affects the cpu ? i mean.. im using 64bti 7.10 , it will still operate the same ?
2008-02-12T20:28:00.000Z	Tiven	bazhang	 thanks ! what does this exactly does ?
2008-02-12T20:29:00.000Z	Tiven	bazhang	noapic then , not , "irqpoll" ?
2008-02-12T20:34:00.000Z	bazhang	Tiven	no idea there as I have 32 bit and wired mouse--just to test could you try a wired mouse?
2008-02-12T20:34:00.000Z	Tiven	bazhang	yeah hold on buddie
2008-02-12T20:48:00.000Z	bazhang	Tiven	so it is something with the wireless mouse? the wired usb mouse works?
2008-02-12T20:48:00.000Z	Tiven	bazhang	its really weird , since i connected the wired i didnt get any lags at all... neither with the wireless
2008-02-12T20:49:00.000Z	bazhang	Tiven	that is odd--though a nifty workaround ;]
2008-02-12T20:49:00.000Z	Tiven	bazhang	lol i guess so !!
2008-02-12T20:51:00.000Z	Tiven	bazhang	, Bodsda ill use wired/wireless/both for a few minutes for a better test , ill talk to you if i got some news :) Thank you both guys :)
2008-02-12T20:52:00.000Z	bazhang	Tiven	come back if it erupts again ;]
2008-02-12T20:54:00.000Z	bazhang	Tiven	 answer away--just never say the word (automatix/envy) ;]
2008-02-12T20:54:00.000Z	Tiven	bazhang	haha :) i got it :))
2008-02-12T21:08:00.000Z	Tiven	bazhang	.... lagged again :(
