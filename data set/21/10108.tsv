2005-05-13T06:42:00.000Z	Drako60		now how to get dma working without the kernel panicing
2005-05-13T06:44:00.000Z	Drako60		how do edit ide_core to have amd74xxx load befor the rest?
2005-05-13T06:46:00.000Z	Drako60		ahh did all the helpers leave?
2005-05-13T06:47:00.000Z	Drako60		i need to know how to get ide_core to load amd74xx befor the rest of the ide modules
2005-05-13T06:47:00.000Z	calc	Drako60	just remove the ide-generic one from /etc/modules will probably be enough, if its that stupid dma issue
2005-05-13T06:48:00.000Z	Drako60	calc	are you speaking of the nforce dma issue?
2005-05-13T06:50:00.000Z	calc	Drako60	what was the message it gave you? was it the same generic loading first problem or something else?
2005-05-13T06:51:00.000Z	calc	Drako60	so amd74xx loads after ide-generic then?
2005-05-13T06:52:00.000Z	calc	Drako60	if nothing is in /etc/modules then it is either getting loaded in initrd or is being hotplug loaded (i guess)
2005-05-13T06:52:00.000Z	calc	Drako60	to find out you can do:
2005-05-13T06:56:00.000Z	calc	Drako60	it shows ide-generic for you too?
2005-05-13T06:59:00.000Z	calc	Drako60	it has the amd74xx after the ide-generic line?
2005-05-13T07:00:00.000Z	calc	Drako60	do you have a log of your bootup, eg dmesg?
2005-05-13T07:00:00.000Z	calc	Drako60	post it somewhere i want to look at it
2005-05-13T07:02:00.000Z	calc	Drako60	yea
2005-05-13T07:05:00.000Z	Drako60	calc	http://pastebin.com/279785
2005-05-13T07:06:00.000Z	calc	Drako60	it looks like dma should be working on your box
