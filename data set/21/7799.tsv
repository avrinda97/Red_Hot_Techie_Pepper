2006-07-18T16:14:00.000Z	nasty_b		When running "./configure" I get this error: "./configure: line 2958: qmake: command not found" Can anyone help me out?
2006-07-18T16:14:00.000Z	crimsun	nasty_b	what are you trying to compile?
2006-07-18T16:15:00.000Z	crimsun	nasty_b	apt-get build-dep mythv
2006-07-18T16:15:00.000Z	crimsun	nasty_b	mythtv, rather
2006-07-18T16:16:00.000Z	crimsun	nasty_b	after that, apt-get install qmake
2006-07-18T16:16:00.000Z	crimsun	nasty_b	installs what you need to build it.
2006-07-18T16:18:00.000Z	nasty_b	crimsun	needs to be typed with sudo ?
2006-07-18T16:18:00.000Z	crimsun	nasty_b	yes.
2006-07-18T16:21:00.000Z	nasty_b	crimsun	I get the following error when doing the first one: "E: Unable to find a source package for mythtv" and when doing the second: "E: Couldn't find package qmake"
2006-07-18T16:21:00.000Z	crimsun	nasty_b	do you have deb-src lines active?
2006-07-18T16:22:00.000Z	crimsun	nasty_b	then you don't.
2006-07-18T16:22:00.000Z	crimsun	nasty_b	enable them using Synaptic
2006-07-18T16:25:00.000Z	nasty_b	crimsun	I can't find deb-src anywhere
2006-07-18T16:26:00.000Z	crimsun	nasty_b	are you in Synaptic?
