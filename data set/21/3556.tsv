2010-01-18T16:31:00.000Z	ja660k	erUSUL	thanks
2010-01-18T17:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	ja660k	you have to tell weget to writte to stdout
2010-01-18T17:51:00.000Z	ja660k	erUSUL	it is
2010-01-18T17:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	ja660k	wget -O -
2010-01-18T17:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	ja660k	llutz typed it first ;)
2010-01-18T17:53:00.000Z	ja660k	erUSUL	sec
2010-01-18T17:54:00.000Z	ja660k	erUSUL	http://pastie.org/783035
2010-01-18T17:55:00.000Z	ja660k	erUSUL	it sort of works, but it also matches partial text for keyword of text
2010-01-18T17:55:00.000Z	ja660k	erUSUL	if i use -x or -w instead of -e i get broken pipe error
2010-01-18T17:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	ja660k	grep -w -e patter1 -e pattern2 ?
2010-01-18T17:58:00.000Z	ja660k	erUSUL	broken pipe again, is there any cmd line search i can use aside from grep, fgrep egrep?
2010-01-18T17:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	ja660k	why do you have so much concatenated sed's ? the two last ones do the same?
2010-01-18T18:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	ja660k	anyway using shell to parse [ht,x]ml is not a good idea ...
2010-01-18T18:01:00.000Z	ja660k	erUSUL	yeah i know, but i was trying to keep it one file thing, i could write some xslt
2010-01-18T18:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	ja660k	get rid of the |\ in the grep line too
2010-01-18T18:04:00.000Z	ja660k	erUSUL	it worked... thanks for the help
2010-01-18T18:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	ja660k	13:56 < erUSUL> ja660k: grep -w -e patter1 -e pattern2 ?
2010-01-18T18:07:00.000Z	ja660k	erUSUL	errrrr, could of saved you both a headache
2010-01-18T18:07:00.000Z	ja660k	erUSUL	not sure how i missed that.. thanks alot
