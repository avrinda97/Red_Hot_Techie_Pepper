2006-05-19T14:30:00.000Z	linux_galore		I can imagine running anything thats 3 years old in Linux
2006-05-19T14:30:00.000Z	linux_galore		cant*
2006-05-19T14:31:00.000Z	linux_galore		I run stable (debain) to this day on the file server at work, rock solid
2006-05-19T14:31:00.000Z	linux_galore		debian*
2006-05-19T14:32:00.000Z	linux_galore		Debian stable is a good excuse to be lazy,, I keep it updated  lol
2006-05-19T14:33:00.000Z	delmar	linux_galore	yep. i still got hacked tho
2006-05-19T14:33:00.000Z	delmar	linux_galore	but that was more the package itself that allowed the exploit.
2006-05-19T14:33:00.000Z	linux_galore	delmar	not me, not for years to be honest, got a T1 at work heaps of linux machines and never been hacked
2006-05-19T14:34:00.000Z	delmar	linux_galore	anoyingly the package in question.. i was on their site and downloaded a security patch that was released that very day... then they released a patch for that particular exploit a couple days later.. and i missed it.
2006-05-19T14:34:00.000Z	linux_galore	delmar	only got hacked one on a dial up connection about 6 years ago
2006-05-19T14:34:00.000Z	linux_galore		once*
2006-05-19T14:34:00.000Z	delmar	linux_galore	this wasnt a hack so much as it was just being a pain in the arse
2006-05-19T14:34:00.000Z	delmar	linux_galore	hacked would mean root access or shell access.. they couldnt get that far
2006-05-19T14:35:00.000Z	delmar	linux_galore	too much encryption... my wife setup the encryption tighter than her u know where.. and thats saying something :P
2006-05-19T14:35:00.000Z	linux_galore	delmar	be suprised if they actually got into the network, three firewall and an IDS packet filter
2006-05-19T14:36:00.000Z	linux_galore	delmar	there are some distro that have everythong encrypted even the file system and swap
2006-05-19T14:38:00.000Z	linux_galore		https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperFlight7
2006-05-19T14:38:00.000Z	delmar	linux_galore	yeah i setup my own bawx with some cryptoFS.  had the sql, mail, www, logs, home dirs... all encrypted... only snag was .. if the box was rebooted.. u had to login to run the script and enter the pass phrases to mount the encrypted volumes and start the effected services
2006-05-19T14:39:00.000Z	linux_galore	delmar	I did the crpto stuff on a system, hardisk got a bad sector and the whole thing went south
2006-05-19T14:39:00.000Z	delmar	linux_galore	i guess u need some raid mirror to help that :P
2006-05-19T14:41:00.000Z	linux_galore	delmar	I just use LIDS now and I tell everyone not to leave private stuff on there machine but dump it in the virtual data safe (secure file server)
