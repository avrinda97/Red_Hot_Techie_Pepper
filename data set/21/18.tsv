2004-10-26T13:45:00.000Z	Pizbit		So, who's the lucky person who gets page of stuff that went wrong?:)
2004-10-26T13:45:00.000Z	jdub	Pizbit	ubuntu-users list, or bugzilla for specific issues
2004-11-02T12:36:00.000Z	jdub	Pizbit	yes, all there by default
2004-11-05T13:33:00.000Z	Pizbit	jdub	Yeah
2004-11-09T13:02:00.000Z	jdub	Pizbit	neither did we ;)
2004-11-10T12:12:00.000Z	Pizbit	jdub	It's just not fair:)
2004-11-10T12:15:00.000Z	Pizbit	jdub	Sounds interesting
2004-11-10T13:11:00.000Z	jdub	Pizbit	be nice, please
2004-11-10T14:35:00.000Z	Pizbit	jdub	Perhaps synaptic should have the filter by default?
2004-11-11T07:54:00.000Z	Pizbit	jdub	You're in NZ?
2004-11-11T07:54:00.000Z	jdub	Pizbit	sydney
2004-11-12T10:57:00.000Z	Pizbit	jdub	What'd I miss?
2004-11-14T15:00:00.000Z	jdub	Pizbit	no, that's not why
2004-11-14T15:00:00.000Z	Pizbit	jdub	Er, I was thinking of the patented bit but I'm typing somehting else too so I didn't bother heh:)
2004-11-15T11:27:00.000Z	Pizbit	jdub	Yeah, it's kinda odd the installer chose 386 when the cpu is an amd xp(k6 I think)
2004-11-15T11:28:00.000Z	jdub	Pizbit	k7. it's not always right to make that choice.
2004-11-15T11:28:00.000Z	Pizbit	jdub	o_O? Why's that?
2004-11-15T11:28:00.000Z	jdub	Pizbit	safety.
2004-11-17T11:29:00.000Z	jdub	Pizbit	it's a joke. kde has a search tool in its kontrol thingy
2004-11-17T11:30:00.000Z	Pizbit	jdub	I know, but it was the nearest I can think of.
2004-11-18T09:07:00.000Z	Pizbit	jdub	I think some people are simply just addicted to updating, whether it's a placebo or a real update doesn't matter.
