2010-01-07T02:41:00.000Z	mmvx		using ssh-keygen -t rsa?
2010-01-07T02:42:00.000Z	mkanyicy	mmvx	-t rsa is the default
2010-01-07T02:44:00.000Z	mmvx	mkanyicy	thanks I didn't know that
2010-01-07T02:50:00.000Z	mkanyicy	mmvx	what about backing up the .ssh directory and removing it and restart ssh-keygen ?
2010-01-07T02:51:00.000Z	mkanyicy	mmvx	what if Doons backs up the .ssh directory and removing it and restart ssh-keygen instead of creating a new user?
2010-01-07T02:51:00.000Z	mmvx	mkanyicy	maybe you have a point there's no other obvious reason why it would fail
2010-01-07T02:52:00.000Z	mkanyicy	mmvx	what versions of linux are you running on both machines, Doonz ?
2010-01-07T02:52:00.000Z	mmvx	mkanyicy	he's running 9.10 server on both, default
2010-01-07T03:06:00.000Z	mmvx	mkanyicy	that needs to be on the remote server no?
2010-01-07T03:08:00.000Z	mmvx	mkanyicy	you can just issue the command: cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user@server 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'
2010-01-07T03:09:00.000Z	mmvx	mkanyicy	then you just get asked for the password once and it's done
2010-01-07T03:09:00.000Z	mkanyicy	mmvx	i saw your fancy command but I don't trust it
2010-01-07T03:09:00.000Z	mmvx	mkanyicy	I do this for a living
2010-01-07T03:22:00.000Z	mkanyicy	mmvx	Doonz perhaps there is a proxy server / firewall
2010-01-07T04:24:00.000Z	mmvx	mkanyicy	you know Doonz's problem was 777 permissions on his home dir. How did that happen!! :)
2010-01-07T04:24:00.000Z	mkanyicy	mmvx	serious!
2010-01-07T04:25:00.000Z	mkanyicy	mmvx	Doonz I never knew that ssh was checking permissions as well for security reasons
2010-01-07T04:26:00.000Z	mmvx	mkanyicy	I didn't know it was THAT pedantic
2010-01-08T06:48:00.000Z	mmvx	mkanyicy	long long long???
2010-01-08T06:48:00.000Z	mkanyicy	mmvx	many many days
2010-01-08T06:50:00.000Z	mmvx	mkanyicy	cheers
