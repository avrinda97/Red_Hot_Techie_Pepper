2008-05-30T22:23:00.000Z	studente		Hello!
2008-05-30T22:24:00.000Z	studente		Any chances to boot Ubuntu live from a USB stick on macbook? Google is quite silent about this
2008-05-30T22:25:00.000Z	m-c	studente	it is very probably that it works, but it may not be easy nor may there be step by step instructions
2008-05-30T22:26:00.000Z	studente	m-c	Indeed, they is no much information around :(
2008-05-30T22:26:00.000Z	studente	m-c	My macbook is a intel based one, mayve that helps?
2008-05-30T22:26:00.000Z	m-c	studente	macs tend to be a more closed hardware solution.  no surprise
2008-05-30T22:26:00.000Z	studente	m-c	got you
2008-05-30T22:28:00.000Z	studente	m-c	They're maybe way more closed than Apple itself...
2008-05-30T22:36:00.000Z	studente	m-c	Sorry about disturbing, but I wanted to know what do you think...
2008-05-30T22:37:00.000Z	m-c	studente	think about what?  :)
2008-05-30T22:38:00.000Z	studente	m-c	About how so many boot loaders do work with MS windows, but non with Mac, which is more "open" than Microsoft Products :)
2008-05-30T22:39:00.000Z	m-c	studente	microsoft and linux run on x86 hardware which is extremely open, mac hardware has always been extremely closed, by comparison
2008-05-30T22:40:00.000Z	m-c	studente	the same can be said for the mac osx hardware drivers - all closed
2008-05-30T22:40:00.000Z	studente	m-c	Got you
2008-05-30T22:41:00.000Z	studente	m-c	Aren't the Intel procesors implemented in Mc x86 now?
2008-05-30T22:41:00.000Z	m-c	studente	are you using a x86 architecture for your mac software?  I thought you were asking about linux on mac hardware
2008-05-30T22:42:00.000Z	studente	m-c	I'm using an Intel based CPU on my macbook
2008-05-30T22:43:00.000Z	m-c	studente	then why ask how to create a usb boot for ubuntu on a mac ?
2008-05-30T22:43:00.000Z	m-c	studente	oh, do you mean how do it within the osx operating system?
2008-05-30T22:52:00.000Z	studente	m-c	Exacly
2008-05-30T22:53:00.000Z	studente	m-c	Exacly
