2010-10-19T09:11:00.000Z	Guest25477		Can I use fsck to check all my hard drives?  If so what is the command?
2010-10-19T09:12:00.000Z	yapsol	Guest25477	are all of them ext-something?
2010-10-19T09:13:00.000Z	Guest25477	yapsol	what do you mean by ext-something
2010-10-19T09:13:00.000Z	yapsol		if they are all ext2, ext3 or ext4
2010-10-19T09:14:00.000Z	Guest25477	yapsol	I mounted them all to a file named storage.  So I guess if I fsck this folder it will scan all of them huh
2010-10-19T09:15:00.000Z	yapsol		fsck doesn't work this way
2010-10-19T09:15:00.000Z	Guest25477		darn
2010-10-19T09:15:00.000Z	Guest25477	yapsol	so do i need to target them with the name specified in /dev
2010-10-19T09:15:00.000Z	yapsol		do this: type echo /dev/[hs]d[abcd][0-9]
2010-10-19T09:16:00.000Z	yapsol		no, to Guest25477 - this will list all the drives
2010-10-19T09:18:00.000Z	Guest25477	yapsol	thanks that is a neat little command
2010-10-19T09:18:00.000Z	yapsol		When you type this at a terminal, echo /dev/[hs]d[abcd][0-9] all your partitions will be listed. One of them will be the swap
2010-10-19T09:19:00.000Z	Guest25477	yapsol	so what does the fsck command look like with all my HD listed?
2010-10-19T09:21:00.000Z	yapsol	Guest25477	it should be fsck /dev/partition
2010-10-19T09:21:00.000Z	Guest25477	yapsol	thank you for your help
2010-10-19T09:21:00.000Z	yapsol		you need to repeat the command for all your partitions
2010-10-19T09:22:00.000Z	Guest25477		yeah I read that, so i just need to man up and come back after a couple minutes for each one
2010-10-19T09:22:00.000Z	yapsol	Guest25477	i don't remember, but you may need to use sudo
2010-10-19T09:22:00.000Z	yapsol		sudo fsck /dev/partition
2010-10-19T09:22:00.000Z	Guest25477		yes thank you.
2010-10-19T09:23:00.000Z	Guest25477	yapsol	take care and thanks for the help again
