2006-07-03T05:45:00.000Z	hou5ton		I'm trying to follow the "FixVideoResoution" instructions, but when I run aticonfig it says no such command, and I don't see it in Synaptic?  What can I do to run that command on this machine?
2006-07-03T05:47:00.000Z	mwe	hou5ton	have you installed xorg-driver-fglrx?
2006-07-03T05:47:00.000Z	hou5ton	mwe	 I'll check
2006-07-03T05:47:00.000Z	mwe	hou5ton	that's the binary ati driver
2006-07-03T05:47:00.000Z	mwe	hou5ton	plus aticonfig
2006-07-03T05:48:00.000Z	hou5ton	mwe	 I don't have that installed
2006-07-03T05:49:00.000Z	mwe	hou5ton	well then you hadn't installed the ati driver in the first place
2006-07-03T05:49:00.000Z	hou5ton	mwe	 I'm installing it now
2006-07-03T05:58:00.000Z	hou5ton	mwe	 running aticonfig --initial etc. ... gives me two "Monitor" and "Screen" sections in xorg.conf ... the old one and a new one that it apparantly just wrote.  That doesn't seem right.  Should I delete the old sections?
2006-07-03T05:59:00.000Z	mwe	hou5ton	to be honest I'm not familiar with aticonfig I did it by hand. but I'd guess you could purge the old sections yes
2006-07-03T06:12:00.000Z	hou5ton	mwe	 ok ... we made "some" progress
2006-07-03T06:13:00.000Z	hou5ton	mwe	 before .... with the 1440x900 settings, it would boot to a black screen after login ... now it boots to the wallpaper, but still no sound or loading the rest of Gnome.
2006-07-03T06:17:00.000Z	hou5ton	mwe	... or anyone ..... before .... with the 1440x900 settings, it would boot to a black screen after login ... now it boots to the wallpaper, but still no sound or loading the rest of Gnome.
2006-07-03T06:22:00.000Z	hou5ton	mwe	... you got any more ideas for me? ..... before .... with the 1440x900 settings, it would boot to a black screen after login ... now it boots to the wallpaper, but still no sound or loading the rest of Gnome.
2006-07-03T06:23:00.000Z	hou5ton	mwe	 I have to switch it back to 1024x768 to get it to finish
2006-07-03T06:23:00.000Z	mwe	hou5ton	I don't know what's up. everyone seems to have weird problems today
2006-07-03T06:24:00.000Z	hou5ton	mwe	 I know this probably doesn't make sense, but would it be any different perhaps if I tried xfce
2006-07-03T06:25:00.000Z	mwe	hou5ton	I doubt it. try
2006-07-03T06:56:00.000Z	mwe	hou5ton	alsamixer
2006-07-03T06:57:00.000Z	hou5ton	mwe	 that opens the bar graphs ... but no way to change them
2006-07-03T06:57:00.000Z	mwe	hou5ton	oh
