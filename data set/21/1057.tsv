2011-03-01T06:00:00.000Z	sysadm	ex0a	i like what am seeing, i will give you feedback
2011-03-01T06:01:00.000Z	ex0a	sysadm	the link fairly early in that first post (http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1599293) may be of interest to you as well
2011-03-01T06:05:00.000Z	sysadm	ex0a	i got an error file not found , need to load kernel first
2011-03-01T06:05:00.000Z	sysadm	ex0a	file is incorrect place
2011-03-01T06:06:00.000Z	ex0a	sysadm	during grub boot?
2011-03-01T06:07:00.000Z	sysadm	ex0a	yes
2011-03-01T06:07:00.000Z	ex0a	sysadm	did you check this link (the second link i pasted) as well? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1599293
2011-03-01T06:13:00.000Z	sysadm	ex0a	i try to use ls (hdX,Y)/      i get error,  i obviously wrote ls (hd0,1)/       but still error
2011-03-01T06:16:00.000Z	ex0a	sysadm	hmm let me read over the guide real quick
2011-03-01T06:17:00.000Z	ex0a	sysadm	you were doing that from the grub rescue prompt right?
2011-03-01T06:18:00.000Z	sysadm	ex0a	no, it didnt say taht did it ?
2011-03-01T06:19:00.000Z	ex0a	sysadm	are you following http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1599293 ? if so at the beginning it describes that all of this is to be run from the grub rescue prompt
2011-03-01T06:19:00.000Z	sysadm	ex0a	 you are missing that i cant boot any cd/floppy/usb, i am working on server with nothing but ssh access and a console
2011-03-01T06:21:00.000Z	ex0a	sysadm	then you can't use the grub2 recovery prompt method.. the first link i pasted would be the only hope you have of booting the iso with grub2 afaik.. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1549847
2011-03-01T06:21:00.000Z	sysadm	ex0a	 am back on track, am on grub command line
2011-03-01T06:22:00.000Z	sysadm	ex0a	nothing but lost+founf
2011-03-01T06:24:00.000Z	sysadm	ex0a	nothing but lost+founf
2011-03-01T06:27:00.000Z	ex0a	sysadm	are you in the recovery console or just the grub command line (are you booted into your os or just into grub?)
