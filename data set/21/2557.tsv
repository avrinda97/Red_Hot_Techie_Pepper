2009-09-06T00:19:00.000Z	Guest36272		I have no idea whats wrong.
2009-09-06T00:20:00.000Z	Guest36272		Action: im using sudo.
2009-09-06T00:21:00.000Z	Guest36272		Action: What do I do then?. I tried chmod 777 on the .tar.gz
2009-09-06T00:21:00.000Z	Guest36272		for the patch
2009-09-06T00:21:00.000Z	Guest36272		nothing.
2009-09-06T00:23:00.000Z	Guest36272		Action: I read that.
2009-09-06T00:24:00.000Z	trism	Guest36272	what are you trying to change in the kernel?
2009-09-06T00:24:00.000Z	Guest36272	trism	Disable dynamic ticks and a few other things
2009-09-06T00:24:00.000Z	trism	Guest36272	yeah you'll need to recompile a kernel for that
2009-09-06T00:25:00.000Z	Guest36272	trism	is there a simple way to do this for ubuntu..?
2009-09-06T00:25:00.000Z	trism	Guest36272	I almost never build a kernel anymore, but I find it significantly easier to just grab a vanilla kernel from kernel.org instead of doing it the ubuntu way
2009-09-06T00:25:00.000Z	Guest36272	trism	The issue is, I'm trying to follow this guide: http://wiki.fragaholics.de/index.php/EN:Linux_Kernel_Optimization
2009-09-06T00:26:00.000Z	Guest36272		Trism: and this happens to me: patch: **** Can't rename file /tmp/poeyGLrd to arch/arm/kernel/process.c : Permission denied
2009-09-06T00:27:00.000Z	trism	Guest36272	you're probably building the kernel source in a place you don't have permissions, I usually build it in my home directory
2009-09-06T00:27:00.000Z	trism	Guest36272	and then copy the kernel bzImage to /boot when I'm ready to use it
2009-09-06T00:27:00.000Z	Guest36272		Trism: Ah, thank you.
2009-09-06T00:27:00.000Z	Guest36272		Trism: Didn't realize that..
2009-09-06T00:28:00.000Z	Guest36272		Trism: Thank you
2009-09-06T00:28:00.000Z	Guest36272		Trism: I'll try now
2009-09-06T00:28:00.000Z	trism	Guest36272	no problem, good luck
