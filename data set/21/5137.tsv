2008-09-06T12:12:00.000Z	joakim		Hi, I want to make two sessions, one with comiz and one "clean" with just xfce4
2008-09-06T12:12:00.000Z	joakim		compiz that is
2008-09-06T12:13:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	joakim	do you really need sessions for that? you could use fusion icon and toggle compiz on and off from the panel?
2008-09-06T12:15:00.000Z	joakim	ushimitsudoki	well, I guess you are right. How do ii make this fusion icon?
2008-09-06T12:16:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	joakim	package is in the repos: "sudo apt-get install fusion-icon"
2008-09-06T12:17:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	joakim	exactly. i use it under xfce to switch on/off compiz/emerald (although i am using compiz less and less, since xfwm now has compositing built in)
2008-09-06T12:18:00.000Z	joakim	ushimitsudoki	greate help! I ran the code in the terminal, now where is my icon? =) Do I have to reboot?
2008-09-06T12:18:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	joakim	no, it should appear in system tray when ran . you will prob want it to start up by default i would think too
2008-09-06T12:19:00.000Z	joakim	ushimitsudoki	alright, I ran it from the panel menu, now it is displayed in my upper right corner. Will now click it ..
2008-09-06T12:20:00.000Z	joakim	ushimitsudoki	wow, there are alot of usefull settings in it! Switching was flawles, now on xfce4
2008-09-06T12:21:00.000Z	joakim	ushimitsudoki	Now, how do I make it enabled on startup?
2008-09-06T12:22:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	joakim	in xfce: setting manager > autostarted apps
2008-09-06T12:23:00.000Z	joakim	ushimitsudoki	Ah of course =) what line of code would that be? Just: "fusion-icon"?
2008-09-06T12:24:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	joakim	yup
2008-09-06T12:24:00.000Z	joakim	ushimitsudoki	Thanx alot for your help!
2008-09-06T12:24:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	joakim	quite welcome enjoy!
2008-09-06T12:26:00.000Z	joakim	ushimitsudoki	One more thing; I want to ad compiz to the autostarted applications to, what line of code is that? "compiz --replace"?
2008-09-06T12:27:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	joakim	yes (but make a note that if you are saving running application that you aren't autostarting applications that are saved - i ran into this and turned of saving running applications - something to keep in mind)
2008-09-06T12:28:00.000Z	joakim	ushimitsudoki	Greate tip! How do I turn "saving apps" off?
2008-09-06T12:29:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	joakim	Settings Manager > Sessions and Startup  (that is a permanent change. the logout dialog has a checkbox so you can toggle it as you like each time if you want to test things out first)
2008-09-06T12:30:00.000Z	joakim	ushimitsudoki	Once again, thank you for your help! IÄºl get back to you if I have more questions for sure =)
