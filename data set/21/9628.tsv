2007-07-17T12:17:00.000Z	Toma-	x89x	whats the problem?
2007-07-17T12:18:00.000Z	Toma-	x89x	unichrome, yes
2007-07-17T12:19:00.000Z	Toma-	x89x	thats fine. dont use this guide tho....
2007-07-17T12:20:00.000Z	Toma-	x89x	if anything, find the unichrome driver and install it via synaptic or apt-get then just run 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg' and select unichrome as thedriver
2007-07-17T12:20:00.000Z	Toma-	x89x	if i cant, someone here will. also, try to cram as much as you can into 1 line rather than using enter over and over and over again :)
2007-07-17T12:25:00.000Z	Toma-	x89x	you need both 'xserver-xorg-unichrome' and 'xserver-xorg-via' i do believe
2007-07-17T12:26:00.000Z	Toma-	x89x	vesa is rock solid but doesnt have very good resolutions :(
2007-07-17T12:26:00.000Z	Toma-	x89x	sure. cant hurt
2007-07-17T12:30:00.000Z	Toma-	x89x	run 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg' and select unichrome or via as thedriver
2007-07-17T12:33:00.000Z	Toma-	x89x	probably not...
2007-07-17T12:35:00.000Z	Toma-	x89x	what unichrome chip do you have?
2007-07-17T12:38:00.000Z	Toma-	x89x	ok
2007-07-17T12:46:00.000Z	Toma-	x89x	doing a little investigating on your video card.... seems it doesnt work in linux :O
2007-07-17T12:48:00.000Z	Toma-	x89x	you can try
2007-07-17T12:49:00.000Z	Toma-	x89x	'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'
2007-07-17T13:15:00.000Z	Toma-	x89x	not for long
2007-07-17T13:17:00.000Z	Toma-	x89x	run 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg' and select unichrome or via as thedriver
2007-07-17T13:18:00.000Z	Toma-	x89x	well im not sure then, sorry :(
2007-07-17T13:19:00.000Z	Toma-	x89x	'lspci'
