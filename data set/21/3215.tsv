2009-03-05T01:47:00.000Z	TwistedGhost		get rid of the old partition
2009-03-05T01:48:00.000Z	TwistedGhost		?
2009-03-05T01:48:00.000Z	tekteen	TwistedGhost	if you mount both drives, you can just copy them
2009-03-05T01:49:00.000Z	TwistedGhost	tekteen	when i try to copy them it just fills my hard drive even more i have a whole 28gb left and need to transfer 120gb of media
2009-03-05T01:49:00.000Z	tekteen	TwistedGhost	you could have mentioned that
2009-03-05T01:49:00.000Z	tekteen	TwistedGhost	you need to find a place to put it
2009-03-05T01:50:00.000Z	TwistedGhost	tekteen	why can you not help with that?
2009-03-05T01:50:00.000Z	tekteen	TwistedGhost	How would any of us know where to put your files? We can tell you how, but not where
2009-03-05T01:51:00.000Z	tekteen	TwistedGhost	you need to put everything on the old partition somewhere first
2009-03-05T01:52:00.000Z	TwistedGhost	tekteen	what do you mean by put it somewhere?
2009-03-05T01:52:00.000Z	tekteen	TwistedGhost	what you need to do is first move the files off the partition you want to delete
2009-03-05T01:53:00.000Z	tekteen	TwistedGhost	big usb hard disk
2009-03-05T01:54:00.000Z	tekteen	TwistedGhost	apparently you have no way to delete the partition
2009-03-05T01:55:00.000Z	TwistedGhost	tekteen	is there a site or something that would allow me to just store 120gb of files so i can reinstall and then get them
2009-03-05T01:56:00.000Z	tekteen	TwistedGhost	Uploading it would take years
2009-03-05T01:56:00.000Z	tekteen	TwistedGhost	if one exited ;-)
2009-03-05T01:56:00.000Z	tekteen	TwistedGhost	you need to have a place to store it
2009-03-05T01:56:00.000Z	tekteen	TwistedGhost	yeah
2009-03-05T01:57:00.000Z	TwistedGhost	tekteen	can you pm me its to clutered in here
2009-03-05T02:26:00.000Z	TwistedGhost	tekteen	you there?
