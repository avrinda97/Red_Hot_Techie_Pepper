2011-11-01T22:05:00.000Z	halomom		anyone know how to make an ISO and turn it into a directory?
2011-11-01T22:06:00.000Z	ForXDoY	halomom	you can also make an ISO using Brasero Disc Burner
2011-11-01T22:08:00.000Z	halomom	ForXDoY	and to make it a directory?
2011-11-01T22:09:00.000Z	ForXDoY	halomom	you mean mounting it to a directory? Just try what zykotick9 said
2011-11-01T22:10:00.000Z	halomom	ForXDoY	zykotick9, I a amking an ISO of a CD, and I want to mount the image I'm creating, not burn it
2011-11-01T22:11:00.000Z	ForXDoY	halomom	I'll quote the bot for you: To mount an ISO disc image, type « sudo mount -o loop <ISO-filename> <mountpoint> » - There is a list of useful cd image conversion tools at http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/CD_Image_Conversion - Always verify the ISO using !MD5 before !burning.
2011-11-01T22:14:00.000Z	halomom	ForXDoY	I just figured I'd grab the both of you at once. thanks guys (I've never mounted an ISO o linux, just windows)
2011-11-01T22:14:00.000Z	ForXDoY	halomom	you're welcome :)
2011-11-01T22:20:00.000Z	halomom	ForXDoY	it doesn't work, it ees it as a USB drive, not a CD
2011-11-01T22:21:00.000Z	ForXDoY	halomom	I thought you wanted to see it as a  directory?
2011-11-01T22:21:00.000Z	halomom	ForXDoY	oh, sorry, no I want it mounted like a CD, in a dirctory
2011-11-01T22:23:00.000Z	ForXDoY	halomom	I would try the command: sudo mount isoimage.iso /media/cdrom0 -o loop
2011-11-01T22:34:00.000Z	ForXDoY	halomom	no, it's oneiric
2011-11-01T22:34:00.000Z	halomom	ForXDoY	ten why didn't update manager request it? *blinks*
2011-11-01T22:35:00.000Z	ForXDoY	halomom	request what? The update to 11.10?
2011-11-01T22:35:00.000Z	halomom	ForXDoY	yes
2011-11-01T22:36:00.000Z	ForXDoY	halomom	^
2011-11-01T22:38:00.000Z	ForXDoY	halomom	somewhere in the middle of October, I think
2011-11-01T22:39:00.000Z	halomom	ForXDoY	odd.. cause I just installed this PC with natty last night from LTS
2011-11-01T22:40:00.000Z	ForXDoY	halomom	might be by design, if some packages needed to be transitionally updated (in my lack of better words for it), but I'm just guessing here
2011-11-01T22:41:00.000Z	halomom	ForXDoY	eh.. no big deal I'll get around to t later then
