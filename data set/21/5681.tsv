2007-08-31T10:24:00.000Z	mu9214		can anyone tell me how to edit a file in the terminal, without using vi, or pico, etc.  just using like cat, and echo, etc. I know how to CREATE files, but now how to edit them..
2007-08-31T10:25:00.000Z	bruenig	mu9214	sed, awk, and grep
2007-08-31T10:25:00.000Z	mu9214	bruenig	how?
2007-08-31T10:25:00.000Z	bruenig	mu9214	so complicated
2007-08-31T10:26:00.000Z	bruenig	mu9214	unless you are scripting, or need it for specific cases, it makes more sense to vim it
2007-08-31T10:26:00.000Z	mu9214	bruenig	see me last response
2007-08-31T10:26:00.000Z	bruenig	mu9214	I can do something if you have something specific and then explain to you how it does that but there are so many things as you can imagine that to simply say it would bhard
2007-08-31T10:27:00.000Z	bruenig	mu9214	like to simply say, hey this is how you use sed is crazy
2007-08-31T10:28:00.000Z	bruenig	mu9214	give something specific and I will show you
2007-08-31T10:28:00.000Z	mu9214	bruenig	say I have file "file.txt" and on line 7 i want to change  some(thing) to (something)  .. just an example.
2007-08-31T10:30:00.000Z	bruenig	mu9214	is there anything about line 7 that makes it unique, like a string that only exists on line 7
2007-08-31T10:30:00.000Z	bruenig	mu9214	I mean are you trying to simple change a string from one thing to another?
2007-08-31T10:31:00.000Z	mu9214	bruenig	yes. pretty much
2007-08-31T10:31:00.000Z	bruenig	mu9214	ok so what are you trying to change and what are you trying to change it to?
2007-08-31T10:32:00.000Z	bruenig	mu9214	ok well if the string arial is nowhere else in the file, you can just do sed 's/arial/comic sans ms//' -i textfile
2007-08-31T10:33:00.000Z	bruenig	mu9214	ir you want all instances of arial changed to comic sans ms, you would do sed 's/arial/comic sans ms/g' -i textfile
2007-08-31T10:33:00.000Z	bruenig	mu9214	oh that first command has a typo: sed 's/arial/comic sans/' -i textfile
2007-08-31T10:33:00.000Z	mu9214	bruenig	whats the difference between the 2 commands?
2007-08-31T10:33:00.000Z	bruenig	mu9214	you see the g?
2007-08-31T10:34:00.000Z	mu9214	bruenig	yeah.
2007-08-31T10:34:00.000Z	mu9214	bruenig	whats it do?
