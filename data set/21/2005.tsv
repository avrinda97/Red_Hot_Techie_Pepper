2010-09-01T20:15:00.000Z	sacarlson	askhader	 as far as I know you are correct nothing.
2010-09-01T20:21:00.000Z	sacarlson	askhader	I should have asked to see what was in you *.pl file but maybe you need this DISPLAY=:0.0 to do xserver stuf
2010-09-01T20:21:00.000Z	askhader	sacarlson	It could be.
2010-09-01T20:23:00.000Z	askhader	sacarlson	Do you have any interest in looking at the script?
2010-09-01T20:23:00.000Z	sacarlson	askhader	sure why not
