2006-07-09T08:00:00.000Z	Simthumb		but I wanted to try using the networks wizard
2006-07-09T08:00:00.000Z	Simthumb		sorry
2006-07-09T08:00:00.000Z	Simthumb		also,
2006-07-09T08:00:00.000Z	Simthumb		I try installing Ubuntu,
2006-07-09T08:01:00.000Z	Simthumb		I saw the docs on how to dual boot,
2006-07-09T08:01:00.000Z	Simthumb		I get up to step 7 on clicking manually edit partition tree,
2006-07-09T08:01:00.000Z	Simthumb		and it freezes
2006-07-09T08:01:00.000Z	Simthumb		I tried to wait
2006-07-09T08:01:00.000Z	Simthumb		I waited a whole half an hour
2006-07-09T08:01:00.000Z	Simthumb		I ended up rebooting
2006-07-09T08:01:00.000Z	sharms	Simthumb	did you check the integrity of the cd?
2006-07-09T08:02:00.000Z	sharms	Simthumb	link to that guide?
2006-07-09T08:04:00.000Z	sharms	Simthumb	2 gigs minimum will work
2006-07-09T08:04:00.000Z	sharms	Simthumb	as for the freeze, reboot and try again
2006-07-09T08:05:00.000Z	sharms	Simthumb	only if you partitioned it correctly before you installed windows
2006-07-09T08:06:00.000Z	sharms	Simthumb	is that 5 gigs free what it says in windows?
2006-07-09T08:06:00.000Z	sharms	Simthumb	then what you need to do is defrag, and reboot with ubuntu cd and resize partition.  Or if you have a tool like partition magic you can also do it
2006-07-09T08:07:00.000Z	sharms	Simthumb	when you install windows it automatically makes a partition the size of the entire drive.  You want to decrease it by 5 gigs so that linux can have it's own slice of the harddrive.
2006-07-09T08:07:00.000Z	sharms	Simthumb	Also you will actually want 2 slices for linux, 1 that is like 4.5 gigs for linux itself, and 1 that is like 500mb for a "swap" partition
2006-07-09T08:08:00.000Z	sharms	Simthumb	I believe so
2006-07-09T08:14:00.000Z	sharms	Simthumb	- usb drive maybe?  other computer then burn to cd?
