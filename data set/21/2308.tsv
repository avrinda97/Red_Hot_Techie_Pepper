2009-11-23T03:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rooist47	 kim_Da_Nite  the version of Virtualbox from the repo or Software Centre is the open source verison which lacks USB support,  go to the website if wanting the one that has it, that's also closed source
2009-11-23T03:36:00.000Z	rooist47	sebsebseb	now if I try to delet vboxusers group and uninstall VirtualBox to do a new installation
2009-11-23T03:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rooist47	ok
2009-11-23T03:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rooist47	in 9.04  Virtualbox  non OSE version needed  setting up with a command or two, for the USB support
2009-11-23T03:37:00.000Z	rooist47	sebsebseb	does that clear all files related to the old installation of VBox ?
2009-11-23T03:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rooist47	I assume this is probably also the case with 9.10
2009-11-23T03:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rooist47	you could do sudo purge packagename   to remove  virtualbox and config files,  however  the hidden .virtualbox folder in Home will probably stil be there
2009-11-23T03:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rooist47	or use synaptic and remove the program with config files as well
2009-11-23T03:38:00.000Z	rooist47	sebsebseb	I prefer apt-get
2009-11-23T03:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rooist47	have you got vm's on there that you want to keep?
2009-11-23T03:40:00.000Z	rooist47	sebsebseb	ZykoticK9 I have to keep just one vhd
2009-11-23T03:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rooist47	copy/move it some where else, and you can delete .virtaulbox
2009-11-23T03:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rooist47	or just keep that
2009-11-23T03:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rooist47	you just want USB set up
2009-11-23T03:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rooist47	This webpage should be updated for Karmic really, but here you go https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VirtualBox/USB
2009-11-23T03:45:00.000Z	rooist47	sebsebseb	thx just 8min time of downloading the newest VBox version and I'll try
2009-11-23T03:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rooist47	those instructions are for 9.04, but I assume they will be ok on 9.10 as well
2009-11-23T03:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rooist47	You could also try Googleing for Karmic instructions
2009-11-23T03:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	rooist47	You are on 9.10/Karmic yes?
2009-11-23T03:47:00.000Z	rooist47	sebsebseb	yes
2009-11-23T03:49:00.000Z	rooist47	sebsebseb	I'll be back
