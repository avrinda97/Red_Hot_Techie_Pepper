2009-06-12T03:37:00.000Z	chrones		Hey guys, I am new to linux and ubuntu (first time user) and I just installed ubuntu jaunty 2 days ago. I was wondering do I need to install any drivers for my video card?
2009-06-12T03:38:00.000Z	patapouf	chrones	Usually you can keep the default, but it's better to install the proprietary drivers. that can be install using the Restricted Driver Manager
2009-06-12T03:39:00.000Z	chrones	patapouf	how do i get to the restricted driver manager?
2009-06-12T03:39:00.000Z	patapouf	chrones	System -> Administration -> Hardware Drivers
2009-06-12T03:40:00.000Z	patapouf	chrones	than you need to activate the drivers (if disable). What is your Card ?
2009-06-12T03:41:00.000Z	chrones	patapouf	I was already snooping around in there but there doesnt seem to be anything to install (see screenshot): http://img4.imageshack.us/img4/8937/screenshothardwaredrive.png
2009-06-12T03:41:00.000Z	patapouf		I know I keep buggin people about this problem, but I'm about to do a heartbreak. Is there any decent solution for people having ATI card not supported by fglrx ?
2009-06-12T03:42:00.000Z	patapouf	chrones	What is your card ??
2009-06-12T03:42:00.000Z	chrones		ATi Radeon 9800 pro
2009-06-12T03:42:00.000Z	chrones		agp
2009-06-12T03:43:00.000Z	patapouf	chrones	Ok, ADM/ATI doesn't support this card any more with there propreitery drivers. The solution is to stay with your current setup : keep the open source driver.
2009-06-12T03:43:00.000Z	patapouf	chrones	Is ther performance is decent ?
2009-06-12T03:44:00.000Z	chrones	patapouf	Desktop performance is fine but I am trying to play Counter Strike Source (I wanna see if i can get i running on my linux machine) and I keep crashing and I think it is because of the video drivers. I didnt install any drivers at all though, they come pre-installed
2009-06-12T03:46:00.000Z	chrones	patapouf	Like the game crashes when i try to join a server I cant even join. And when i load the game via Steam on Wine it says somethign about out of date drivers
2009-06-12T03:46:00.000Z	patapouf	chrones	At this time, with Jaunty you can forget it. Since the only driver for ATI card is the open source one, the performance in 3D is really bad ..
2009-06-12T03:47:00.000Z	patapouf	chrones	We are a bunch of people in the same situation (Including me)
2009-06-12T03:47:00.000Z	chrones	patapouf	Do you think going to an earlier version of ubuntu say 8.0ish would help?
2009-06-12T03:48:00.000Z	patapouf	chrones	wep, cause the propreitery driver gonna work. And I suggest you to install 8.04 as it's a LongTermSupport release (it's more stable)
2009-06-12T03:49:00.000Z	patapouf		chrones:If you plan is to do some gaming I guess it's a good choice to try Hardy 8.04 until we get a decent open source driver for 3D
2009-06-12T03:49:00.000Z	chrones	patapouf	Cool, thanks for the help
2009-06-12T03:49:00.000Z	patapouf	chrones	it's pleasure, and have fun trying Hardy ! :)
