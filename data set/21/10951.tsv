2009-05-02T16:57:00.000Z	lazermann		Well I have qmmp and it sucks. I used to like xmms, but can't find nothing but xmms2 which sucks greatly
2009-05-02T16:58:00.000Z	lazermann		What other payer do you mean?
2009-05-02T16:58:00.000Z	lazermann		ok
2009-05-02T16:58:00.000Z	lazermann		like setup.exe?
2009-05-02T16:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lazermann	 you can compile xmms on ubuntu if you really really want xmms
2009-05-02T17:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lazermann	 to restore you could backup your xorg.conf first..  then restore it if needed.
2009-05-03T03:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lazermann	 you DONT login directly as root. :)
2009-05-03T03:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lazermann	 learn to use the command line to do rooty tasks is the best thing todo.
2009-05-03T03:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lazermann	 dosent matter what mandriva does. :) .. its  bad security practice
2009-05-03T03:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lazermann	 i install 'mc' and then do 'sudo mc' in a terminal, use that simple file manager to do 'root' filemanaging tasks.
2009-05-03T03:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lazermann	 theres no need to do 'su' either.
2009-05-03T03:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lazermann	 running nautilus as root can be dangerous CLOSE it out as soon as you are done doing the rooty tasks.
2009-05-03T03:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lazermann	  using the wrong Natilus window when you think its the 'users' windws when its the root users window.. can be eiather a little problem.. or a HUGE problem...
2009-05-03T03:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lazermann	 thats why i suggested using 'mc' in a terminal. for root tasks
2009-05-03T03:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lazermann	  winamp has a lot of skin 'verison/changes' over the last few years
