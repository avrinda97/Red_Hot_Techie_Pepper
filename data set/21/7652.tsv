2006-08-12T05:30:00.000Z	sahasrara		someone on the forum sent me to the standard linux modem compabitility sites, i say they are not enough, that distros should be specified with modems in lists
2006-08-12T05:31:00.000Z	sahasrara		oh that's what sudo means
2006-08-12T05:31:00.000Z	sahasrara		i saw "sudo make" somewhere
2006-08-12T05:32:00.000Z	sahasrara		linux is taking over my life, i've got 3 books i'm reading on it, plus websites
2006-08-12T05:32:00.000Z	sahasrara		all this to save a buck not having to upgrade to windows lol
2006-08-12T05:33:00.000Z	sahasrara		ok i also just always wanted to switch to linux
2006-08-12T05:33:00.000Z	azureal	sahasrara	that's pretty sad, w/ three books and sites and you don't know sudo lol
2006-08-12T05:38:00.000Z	azureal	sahasrara	oh, i glanced at that book...and don't like it
2006-08-12T05:38:00.000Z	sahasrara	azureal	which one don't you like? Unix in a Nutshell?
2006-08-12T05:39:00.000Z	azureal	sahasrara	i looked at linux in a nutshell for about 5 minutes before deleting it
2006-08-12T05:40:00.000Z	sahasrara	azureal	ohh
2006-08-12T05:43:00.000Z	sahasrara	azureal	and OneTruth: well i think the reference books are nice b/c they are portable, right? sometimes i like to just read a paper book
2006-08-12T05:43:00.000Z	sahasrara	azureal	that's good to know too
2006-08-12T05:45:00.000Z	azureal	sahasrara	basically, the more you read, the better
2006-08-12T05:46:00.000Z	sahasrara	azureal	that's why i hurt myself reading so much, and still have more to read lol
2006-08-12T05:47:00.000Z	sahasrara	azureal	and i don't mind being pointed in a direction, i just like ppl to understand that i do research a lot and sometimes need that nudge
2006-08-12T05:47:00.000Z	azureal	sahasrara	well, you just have people pointing you in the right direction of the reading
2006-08-12T05:48:00.000Z	sahasrara	azureal	this tutorial looks good
2006-08-12T05:48:00.000Z	azureal	sahasrara	linux survival? it's fun =)
2006-08-12T05:55:00.000Z	azureal	sahasrara	you just will have to avoid a lot of fun habits
2006-08-12T05:55:00.000Z	azureal	sahasrara	like anime, lol
