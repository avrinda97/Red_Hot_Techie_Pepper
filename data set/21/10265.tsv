2007-09-17T13:20:00.000Z	Crozar		this is what i thought and i think Unix is engine from the start of the computer world the Award Winner of the expanded Engine is Mac OS and Windows but from theyr they expand Modifications and patching them towards each other
2007-09-17T13:20:00.000Z	Crozar		i might be wrong :P but i like to think of it that way
2007-09-17T13:21:00.000Z	Crozar		lo
2007-09-17T13:21:00.000Z	Crozar		why?
2007-09-17T13:21:00.000Z	Crozar		i thought unix is the start then mac started good project microsoft stole it mac working on other
2007-09-17T13:22:00.000Z	Crozar		i thought unix was made then the producer died
2007-09-17T13:22:00.000Z	Crozar		and no one knew the story
2007-09-17T13:22:00.000Z	Crozar		so i might be right u know i dream and do wizard stuff
2007-09-17T13:22:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Crozar	no, the two guys that wrote the very first Unix are still very much alive
2007-09-17T13:23:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Crozar	dmr's web page is pretty interesting - gives a lot of insight into how they did stuff and why
2007-09-17T13:23:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Crozar	http://plan9.bell-labs.com/who/dmr/ <- prepare to lose an hour or two
2007-09-17T13:24:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Crozar	but yeah, in general googling for "dennis ritchie unix history" would be a start
2007-09-17T13:25:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Crozar	Nah, Windows and Mac both stole from Xerox
2007-09-17T13:26:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Crozar	no no
2007-09-17T13:27:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Crozar	in the late 1960s Xerox had systems that would recognise as a modern desktop environment
2007-09-17T13:32:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Crozar	so as I was saying, yes, there were a lot of different OSes way way before Windows, Mac OS or Linux
2007-09-17T13:33:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Crozar	what happens when you go to the screen resolution menu?
2007-09-17T13:34:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Crozar	it's quite interesting to look at how OSes have evolved
2007-09-17T13:35:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Crozar	you can see how bits have been added on as someone decides it would be a good idea
