2011-08-24T00:22:00.000Z	bytesaber_work	Jordan_U	sigh.... i know what i'm doing.  My question is.  How do I tell 11.04 to place grub on the partition boot sector only.
2011-08-24T00:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bytesaber_work	You don't want it to install grub to a PBR. You should always install grub's boot sector to the mbr, even on macs.
2011-08-24T00:20:00.000Z	bytesaber_work	Jordan_U	no
2011-08-24T00:20:00.000Z	bytesaber_work	Jordan_U	multi boot setup
2011-08-24T00:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bytesaber_work	What bootloader is in the mbr?
2011-08-24T00:20:00.000Z	bytesaber_work	Jordan_U	rEIFt
2011-08-24T00:21:00.000Z	bytesaber_work	Jordan_U	rEFIt
2011-08-24T00:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bytesaber_work	rEFIt is not stored in the mbr. Installing grub to the mbr will not damage rEFIt in any way.
2011-08-24T00:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bytesaber_work	To be perfectly blunt, you do not appear to understand that rEFIt is not stored in the mbr, and installing grub (or any bootloader) without an embedded area is not reliable.
2011-08-24T00:24:00.000Z	bytesaber_work	Jordan_U	GPT/MBR hybrid drive.  I treat all x86 isntalls as BIOS style with emulation.     How do I tell 11.04 how to isntall grub into the first boot sector only?
2011-08-24T00:25:00.000Z	bytesaber_work	Jordan_U	.  Ok i have a typical computer.   Bios only.   I made 3 partitions.     I use my own bootloader in the MBR.   How do I tell 11.04 to only install grub to /dev/sda3
2011-08-24T00:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bytesaber_work	I don't remember where that option is off the top of my head, and I highly recommend installing grub's boot sector in the mbr.
2011-08-24T00:26:00.000Z	bytesaber_work	Jordan_U	if i put grub in the emulated mbr, i'll have an extra detect OS from rEFIt and it's unessary.   chainloads fine.
2011-08-24T00:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bytesaber_work	You will only have an extra detected OS if you have a bootloader installed in the PBR of the partition, which you shouldn't.
2011-08-24T00:27:00.000Z	bytesaber_work	Jordan_U	thanks.
2011-08-24T00:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bytesaber_work	I have a mac with Ubuntu installed and grub installed to the mbr, with only one entry shown for Ubuntu from rEFIt.
2011-08-24T00:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bytesaber_work	You're welcome.
2011-08-24T00:28:00.000Z	bytesaber_work	Jordan_U	but still.   you aren't asnwering the question.    you seem to care more about how i'm handling multi boots.   All i want to know is how to direct a grub install to a specific partiton like any linux distro installer.
2011-08-24T00:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bytesaber_work	I know that option exists, I don't remember where.
2011-08-24T00:28:00.000Z	bytesaber_work	Jordan_U	k,  i'll keep looking and googling.
2011-08-24T00:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bytesaber_work	The alternate install CD uses the classic Debian Installer.
