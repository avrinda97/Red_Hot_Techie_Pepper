2005-09-22T05:20:00.000Z	sybariten		heres a key question for me:  if i try to install ubuntu over a broken install on my mac ... will i be able to do that without formating the drive? in other words, can i do this without losing the 40 gb of movies i collected under ubuntu ?
2005-09-22T05:20:00.000Z	nalioth	sybariten	what's broken about it?
2005-09-22T05:21:00.000Z	sybariten	nalioth	well. i removed gnome panel because gnome complained when it started up. Then i discovered that there is no net connection any more, so i cant apt-get gnome panel back in there.
2005-09-22T05:21:00.000Z	sybariten	nalioth	it started with a shut-off i think
2005-09-22T05:21:00.000Z	nalioth	sybariten	use "apt-cdrom" to rescue yourself
2005-09-22T05:21:00.000Z	sybariten	nalioth	is that a program of its own ?
2005-09-22T05:27:00.000Z	nalioth	sybariten	boot your machine to the console, and use apt-cdrom to fix yourself
2005-09-22T05:28:00.000Z	sybariten	nalioth	i havent even found a good way to boot a ubuntu machine to a plain console
2005-09-22T05:29:00.000Z	nalioth	sybariten	when your machine gets up (as far as it gets) hit ctrl-alt-f3
2005-09-22T05:32:00.000Z	sybariten	nalioth	ok ... and then apt-cdrom ... with the PPC cdrom install cd in the drive.  would it be harmless to do some sort of apt-get remove gnome, apt get install gnome ?
2005-09-22T05:33:00.000Z	nalioth	sybariten	you can try whatever you like
2005-09-22T05:33:00.000Z	nalioth	sybariten	breezy will be out oct 13 and you and apt-cdrom your way to a dist-upgrade of the whole box
2005-09-22T05:37:00.000Z	nalioth	sybariten	you are not gonna be able to fix with the livecd, i dont think
2005-09-22T05:39:00.000Z	sybariten	nalioth	ok maybe not ...  actually i just wanted to see the iMac boot into a non-broken state with the liveCD. Very surprising that i get gnome errors there too ....  when gnome has been running happily in the installed environment, before
2005-09-22T05:39:00.000Z	nalioth	sybariten	that IS surprising
2005-09-22T05:41:00.000Z	nalioth	sybariten	language please
2005-09-22T05:49:00.000Z	nalioth	sybariten	ctrl-alt-f3
2005-11-06T06:47:00.000Z	nalioth	sybariten	try "gmplayer"
2005-11-06T06:50:00.000Z	nalioth	sybariten	i find the ppc version of mplayer lacking sorely
2005-11-06T06:51:00.000Z	sybariten	nalioth	well... could be, but there should at least be some sort of RESULT left to RUN after i have done an INSTALL ...   :)
2005-11-06T12:29:00.000Z	nalioth	sybariten	were you successful?
