2011-05-05T19:21:00.000Z	tneva82		Wish I knew what's up with my youtube speed :( Everything else works fine but that is slow as hell. Last hope was that it was windows related issue and using ubuntu would solve it but nope, not it.
2011-05-05T19:21:00.000Z	tneva82		As it is ubuntu makes it worse :(
2011-05-05T19:22:00.000Z	jo-erlend	tneva82	yes, Youtube has become very slow in Norway too. In Windows, OS X and Ubuntu alike. But it's true that Adobe doesn't make as good software for Linux as for Windows. They're promising that'll change soon though.
2011-05-05T19:24:00.000Z	jo-erlend	tneva82	perhaps you should have a look at your dns settings. Also, are you using wlan?
2011-05-05T19:29:00.000Z	jo-erlend	tneva82	that's not useful at all.
2011-05-05T19:30:00.000Z	jo-erlend	tneva82	move your mouse cursor to the upper left corner.
2011-05-05T19:30:00.000Z	jo-erlend	tneva82	on the bottom of the power icon menu at the top right.
2011-05-05T19:32:00.000Z	jo-erlend	tneva82	if you don't like the new shell, feel free to choose Ubuntu Classic when you login.
2011-05-05T19:33:00.000Z	jo-erlend	tneva82	why don't you ask questions instead of attacking others? Switch to Ubuntu Classic and move the buttons to the right. It'll take three minutes at most.
2011-05-05T19:39:00.000Z	jo-erlend	tneva82	what are you talking about?
2011-05-05T19:40:00.000Z	jo-erlend	tneva82	yes, you've said that. Do you mean the progressbar for the movie, that lets you know how far you've played and what's being loaded?
2011-05-05T19:42:00.000Z	jo-erlend	tneva82	why don't you try to use free software instead of Adobes proprietary software with which we are not allowed to fix bugs?
2011-05-05T19:43:00.000Z	jo-erlend	tneva82	of course. Look in Ubuntu Software Center.
2011-05-05T19:44:00.000Z	jo-erlend	tneva82	you can use the movie player to play videos on Youtube, for instance. Or you can use Firefox to play the movies without any plugins, but you have to enable it in Youtube.
2011-05-05T19:49:00.000Z	jo-erlend	tneva82	as I said before, Firefox is able to play youtube videos without any plugins. You just need to activate html5 video on youtube.
2011-05-05T19:49:00.000Z	jo-erlend	tneva82	http://www.youtube.com/html5
2011-05-05T19:51:00.000Z	jo-erlend	tneva82	please stop cursing here.
2011-05-05T19:53:00.000Z	jo-erlend	tneva82	perhaps using Googles own browser? I suppose the creators of Youtube would make their browser compatible with it, don't you?
2011-05-05T20:03:00.000Z	jo-erlend	tneva82	chrome "doesn't work"?
2011-05-05T20:03:00.000Z	tneva82	jo-erlend	Still slow, still no progress bar
2011-05-05T20:04:00.000Z	jo-erlend	tneva82	does the page itself load quickly?
