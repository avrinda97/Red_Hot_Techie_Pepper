2011-04-08T22:13:00.000Z	mk4	Osmodivs	check that you mic is working properly in another program (or vocaroo.com) if not you need to install another driver for it.
2011-04-08T22:13:00.000Z	mk4		DO I need to uninstall compiz config? I installed it a month or so ago on my 1.6ghz 1GBram netbook running ubuntu 10.10, but its too resource heavy for this machine. how do i uninstall it?
2011-04-08T22:14:00.000Z	Osmodivs	mk4	it is working with the included program in Ubuntu, Sound Recorder
2011-04-08T22:14:00.000Z	mk4	Osmodivs	have you configured skype to use your mic?
2011-04-08T22:14:00.000Z	Osmodivs	mk4	 Is there a command in terminal too know if it is working?
2011-04-08T22:15:00.000Z	Osmodivs	mk4	 Configure, eh?
2011-04-08T22:16:00.000Z	mk4	Osmodivs	have you tested it on the echo/sound test service?
2011-04-08T22:17:00.000Z	Osmodivs	mk4	 Nope, do not know where is that echo/sound test TEST
2011-04-08T22:17:00.000Z	mk4		its a contact in skype.
2011-04-08T22:18:00.000Z	mk4		it calls an echo service, you speak into it for 30 seconds, and it plays it back to you. its a good test to see if skype can read your mic

2011-04-08T22:18:00.000Z	Osmodivs	mk4	 Yeah, it does not work. in the sound settings, all options are automatically set up. there is no way to change anything here.
2011-04-08T22:19:00.000Z	mk4	Osmodivs	do you have pulse audio installed?

2011-04-08T22:20:00.000Z	Osmodivs	mk4	 I am reading something here about having PulseAudio enabeled...
2011-04-08T22:22:00.000Z	mk4		Do you need compiz config to run ubuntu 10.10? it is too system heavy for my machine.
