2007-09-16T16:30:00.000Z	Pelo	crabgrass	 you need to use something like avidemux to  resync the sound
2007-09-16T16:30:00.000Z	Pelo	crabgrass	workflow ?
2007-09-16T16:32:00.000Z	Pelo	crabgrass	 you can do that in avidemux it'S another app, you can use it to ... offset the audio when you resave the file
2007-09-16T16:32:00.000Z	Pelo	crabgrass	to be frank I've never done this before , but I've needed to fix some small vids
2007-09-16T16:34:00.000Z	Pelo	crabgrass	pretty much, on the left side of the image in avidemux you can change the audio format ( from copy to soemething else) and you get access to filters,  what you need should be in there somwehre
2007-09-16T16:35:00.000Z	Pelo	crabgrass	 ?
2007-09-16T16:37:00.000Z	Pelo	crabgrass	yeah, took me a while to figure that one out,  you get access to a butload of filters editing tools and assorted features when you choose something other then copy
