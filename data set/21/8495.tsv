2008-07-14T23:53:00.000Z	scoates		and I don't even have the GUI installed
2008-07-14T23:54:00.000Z	scoates		I'm trying to organize some of my stuff.  doing   mv /mnt/media/music/* /mnt/music   causes my ubuntu box to freeze up. nothing in /var/log/messages nothing in /var/log/syslog    help? Two different disks. Console freezes.
2008-07-14T23:55:00.000Z	linxeh	scoates	mv -v maybe ?
2008-07-14T23:55:00.000Z	linxeh	scoates	or try a copy, and then delete the originals
2008-07-14T23:55:00.000Z	scoates	linxeh	tried that. same problem. It's not just taking a long time, it actually panics and/or crashes
2008-07-14T23:55:00.000Z	linxeh	scoates	or use rsync to clone the two trees
2008-07-14T23:55:00.000Z	scoates	linxeh	I'm not looking for a workaround. I'd like to know how a user can crash the entire box with mv, and fix that.
2008-07-14T23:55:00.000Z	linxeh	scoates	sounds like a dodgy driver / hardware, or configuration option on the device - what media is it ?
2008-07-14T23:56:00.000Z	scoates	linxeh	both disks.
2008-07-14T23:56:00.000Z	linxeh	scoates	and Intel, SiS, VIA, NVidia, ... ?
2008-07-14T23:57:00.000Z	linxeh	scoates	is it overclocked at all ?
2008-07-14T23:57:00.000Z	scoates	linxeh	no. P4/2.26GHz
2008-07-14T23:58:00.000Z	linxeh	scoates	ok, and both drives are on 80 wire cables, with cable select? or Master or ?
2008-07-14T23:58:00.000Z	scoates	linxeh	00:0f.1 IDE interface: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C586A/B/VT82C686/A/B/VT823x/A/C PIPC Bus Master IDE (rev 06)
2008-07-14T23:59:00.000Z	scoates	linxeh	they're both on 80 wire with CS. Come to think of it, they're on the same channel (got that mixed up; sorry). Really shouldn't crash either way
2008-07-15T00:01:00.000Z	scoates	linxeh	is there an ubuntu-way for me to inject memtest into grub?
2008-07-15T00:02:00.000Z	linxeh	scoates	the bootcd has a memtest option I think
2008-07-15T00:03:00.000Z	linxeh	scoates	if you add memtest86=true into the grub.conf then update-grub
2008-07-15T00:03:00.000Z	scoates	linxeh	ty
2008-07-15T00:16:00.000Z	scoates	linxeh	memtest passed twice. Going to swap the IDE cable, now.
2008-07-15T00:33:00.000Z	scoates	linxeh	a bit of progress (-:  mv just segfaulted on me, but it didn't take the box down. How should I diagnose that?
