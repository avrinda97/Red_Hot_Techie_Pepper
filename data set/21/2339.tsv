2009-11-04T09:09:00.000Z	The_reaper489	Minor	do you have Sun java installed?
2009-11-04T09:10:00.000Z	Minor	The_reaper489	No just the adobe_flash installer that it prompted me for.
2009-11-04T09:10:00.000Z	The_reaper489	Minor	you can fix it simply like this. go to your synaptic package manager
2009-11-04T09:10:00.000Z	The_reaper489	Minor	Search Adobe flash
2009-11-04T09:11:00.000Z	The_reaper489	Minor	reinstall
2009-11-04T09:11:00.000Z	The_reaper489	Minor	synaptic package manager is in System->Administration
2009-11-04T09:11:00.000Z	Minor	The_reaper489	I have removed and installed it already. It did not work
2009-11-04T09:12:00.000Z	The_reaper489	Minor	then you are missing a plugin for Mozilla
2009-11-04T09:12:00.000Z	Minor	The_reaper489	which plugin?
2009-11-04T09:13:00.000Z	The_reaper489	Minor	look at the ones you are missing (the ones not in green) and look at the description
2009-11-04T09:13:00.000Z	The_reaper489	Minor	thats all i can offer for info on flash
2009-11-04T09:14:00.000Z	Minor	The_reaper489	thanks
2009-11-04T09:15:00.000Z	The_reaper489	Minor	sorry i could not help more
2009-11-04T09:15:00.000Z	The_reaper489	Minor	i can help you get your ubuntu to look like Mac though...
2009-11-04T09:16:00.000Z	Minor	The_reaper489	I took out adobe flash and put in adobe nonfreee... the flash app wont load now
2009-11-04T09:17:00.000Z	The_reaper489	Minor	the none free is the one you have to pay for...
2009-11-04T09:17:00.000Z	The_reaper489	Minor	i think you should revert back to the free one...
2009-11-04T09:18:00.000Z	Minor	The_reaper489	I will because neither are working well anyway\
2009-11-04T09:18:00.000Z	The_reaper489	Minor	well what version of ubuntu do you have???
