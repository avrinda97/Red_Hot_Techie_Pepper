2009-04-01T13:47:00.000Z	Primedeath		Hello there. :]
2009-04-01T13:48:00.000Z	Primedeath		Question, I just got my new 1TB Drive. When I format it to EXT2 it only shows that 870GB is free. When 910-940GB is it's true space when formatted.
2009-04-01T13:48:00.000Z	Primedeath		I have it connected to my router, and it shows 870GB free out of 916GB.. Even though I have put nothing on it.
2009-04-01T13:48:00.000Z	Primedeath		I am sure.
2009-04-01T13:48:00.000Z	Primedeath		The same loss of space is on EXT3 as well, I did it with my 80GB.
2009-04-01T13:48:00.000Z	linxeh	Primedeath	because 10% is kept for root by default
2009-04-01T13:51:00.000Z	linxeh	Primedeath	you know its not really a 1TB drive right ?
2009-04-01T13:53:00.000Z	linxeh	Primedeath	always ext3
2009-04-01T13:54:00.000Z	linxeh	Primedeath	you could tune the saved space for root down a bit I guess, but mmmm, I'd rather the fs had enough room to recover lost inodes etc if the worst does happen etc
2009-04-01T13:54:00.000Z	linxeh	Primedeath	does your router thing support ext3 ?
2009-04-01T14:00:00.000Z	Primedeath	linxeh	What exactly does the saved space for root do? Does it protect my data? Just to let you know, this is purely storage and I am not using Linux. So it's not like I'll be able to check the filesystem often for errors.
2009-04-01T14:03:00.000Z	linxeh	Primedeath	its so that when the filesystem gets full the root user still has space to do maintenance. essentially, this is so that if the filesystem gets corrupted (maybe due to a crash) when fsck.extN runs it can find all the bits of lost files and "move" them to a lost+found directory so that the sysadmin can piece together bits of lost files for users etc. if you don't have some space there you may never be able to repair a crashed filesystem 
2009-04-01T14:03:00.000Z	linxeh	Primedeath	certainly we leave it alone on filesystems on our multi-TB arrays
2009-04-01T14:05:00.000Z	linxeh	Primedeath	I've seen it a few times, but mainly during power cuts or kernel panics. at work we see it every now and then, a few times a year probably (again due to crashes / power failures). With ext3 the journal takes some of that pain away - its possible the journal is stored in that area too btw
2009-04-01T14:07:00.000Z	Primedeath	linxeh	hmm.. Kernel panics though? Sorry about bothering you so much about this, but as I am not on Linux and the only kernel I could see panicking is my router which is highly unlikely going to mess up the drive.. Or could the filesystem just randomly mess up? I access the drive via Samba that the router provides.
2009-04-01T14:08:00.000Z	linxeh	Primedeath	the router is running linux, so has a kernel too. it might kernel panic for the same reasons any linux system does - hardware failures / issues (eg power, driver problems) etc
2009-04-01T14:09:00.000Z	linxeh	Primedeath	the filesystem shouldnt randomly mess up - its used by millions of machines every day with no problem
2009-04-01T14:09:00.000Z	linxeh	Primedeath	how is the speed of the transfers to that drive via the router? the last time I tried similar I wanted to kill myself it was so slow :)
2009-04-01T14:10:00.000Z	Primedeath	linxeh	not too bad. I can still stream 720p, I just have to set it to 3 second buffer.
2009-04-01T14:11:00.000Z	linxeh	Primedeath	well its not 70GB lost really, you've got a 931GB drive, of which a portion is lost to formatting anyway (in any filesystem), and then you've lost some more for this superuser portion, and some for the journal.  buy another drive if you run out of space :)
2009-04-01T14:11:00.000Z	Primedeath	linxeh	heh.
