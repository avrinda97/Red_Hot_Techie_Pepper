2008-02-12T07:00:00.000Z	shr1k3	_Casey_	;)
2008-02-12T07:09:00.000Z	shr1k3	_Casey_	make sure its not muted in "Volume Control"
2008-02-12T07:11:00.000Z	_Casey_	shr1k3	is it front mic boost?
2008-02-12T07:12:00.000Z	shr1k3	_Casey_	are you in Volume Control?
2008-02-12T07:12:00.000Z	shr1k3	_Casey_	for me I have a "Microphone" column
2008-02-12T07:12:00.000Z	shr1k3	_Casey_	it is defaulted to muted (red X at bottom)
2008-02-12T07:13:00.000Z	shr1k3	_Casey_	go to preferences and check on microphone
2008-02-12T07:14:00.000Z	shr1k3	_Casey_	my prefs shows microphone and microphone capture
2008-02-12T07:15:00.000Z	shr1k3	_Casey_	should be also just microphone above microphone capture
2008-02-12T07:15:00.000Z	shr1k3	_Casey_	probably enable them all and experiment a bit
2008-02-12T07:17:00.000Z	shr1k3	_Casey_	like sound recorder
