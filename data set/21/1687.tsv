2012-05-05T21:33:00.000Z	ozpy		Hi. My sandisk sd card can't be readed/formatted (not locked)... 12.04 detects it but can't do anything. The SD card is the issue. How to recover it?
2012-05-05T21:34:00.000Z	stefg	ozpy	Can you see it using 'sudo fdisk -l'  ?
2012-05-05T21:36:00.000Z	ozpy	stefg	yes pal. I can see it. http://pastebin.com/Jp1Nw04T
2012-05-05T21:37:00.000Z	ozpy	stefg	I used to have a recovery software on Vista for cases like these. But I don't remember the name and run ubuntu only
2012-05-05T21:38:00.000Z	stefg	ozpy	is the sd card really formatted with a linux file system ? (Apart from sda needing a partition table fix fdisk says the sd card is a linux filesystem)
2012-05-05T21:41:00.000Z	stefg	ozpy	so partition type 83 is plausible, right?
2012-05-05T21:43:00.000Z	stefg	ozpy	what happens if you give 'sudo mount -t ext3 /dev/sdb1 /mnt'
2012-05-05T21:49:00.000Z	stefg	ozpy	did you try to mount the card? (see above for command) Any error messages ?
2012-05-05T21:49:00.000Z	ozpy	stefg	One sec. Almost there. Had an issue with my terminal
2012-05-05T21:52:00.000Z	ozpy	stefg	http://pastebin.com/r3vwJCzF
2012-05-05T21:55:00.000Z	stefg	ozpy	'sudo mount -t ext3 /dev/sdb1 /mnt'  ... no typos allowed
2012-05-05T21:56:00.000Z	ozpy	stefg	Now i was able to format it back to fat 32 but I can't open it.
2012-05-05T21:56:00.000Z	stefg	ozpy	your command was wrong
2012-05-05T21:56:00.000Z	stefg	ozpy	ok... so you don't want to recover data, you just want to reformat it and have an empty drive ?
2012-05-05T21:57:00.000Z	ozpy	stefg	Yes.
2012-05-05T21:57:00.000Z	stefg	ozpy	ahhh ... thats easy
2012-05-05T21:58:00.000Z	ozpy	stefg	i want to be able to use it. It's formated to fat32 on gparted... but man, I can't write or read it. it's not locked
2012-05-05T21:58:00.000Z	stefg	ozpy	first of all lets get rid of all the junk: sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb bs=4k
2012-05-05T21:59:00.000Z	stefg	ozpy	say when it's done ...
2012-05-05T22:05:00.000Z	ozpy	stefg	sorry about that but my sistem crashed when I introduced the last instructions you gave me
2012-05-05T22:07:00.000Z	stefg	ozpy	what the command did is overwriting /dev/sdb (the SD-card) with zeroes. if your system crashes when doing so it might be a hardware issue. Here's the command again: sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb bs=4k  be sure to run it on the correct device... it nukes everything there
