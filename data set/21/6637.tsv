2007-03-08T15:10:00.000Z	n-iCe		with UBUNTU
2007-03-08T15:10:00.000Z	gnube	n-iCe	It is paging
2007-03-08T15:10:00.000Z	n-iCe	gnube	what's paging ?
2007-03-08T15:11:00.000Z	gnube	n-iCe	It is when the system swaps out pages to memory
2007-03-08T15:11:00.000Z	n-iCe	gnube	but why with ubuntu always ?
2007-03-08T15:11:00.000Z	gnube	n-iCe	I have no idea, what type of processor are you using?
2007-03-08T15:12:00.000Z	n-iCe	gnube	uhm, intel celeron? pentium 4
2007-03-08T15:12:00.000Z	gnube	n-iCe	do this command: top
2007-03-08T15:13:00.000Z	n-iCe	gnube	done, with top
2007-03-08T15:13:00.000Z	gnube	n-iCe	What does it say?
2007-03-08T15:16:00.000Z	n-iCe	gnube	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/9304/
2007-03-08T15:16:00.000Z	gnube	n-iCe	Whatever Java process you are running is eating up your processor
2007-03-08T15:17:00.000Z	gnube	n-iCe	Some kind of torrent tool?
2007-03-08T15:17:00.000Z	gnube	n-iCe	Kind of a high load average for a single user on a pentium 4
2007-03-08T15:18:00.000Z	gnube	n-iCe	Do this: ps aux | grep torr
2007-03-08T15:18:00.000Z	gnube	n-iCe	No problem, just using your processor to the max
2007-03-08T15:20:00.000Z	n-iCe	gnube	let me reboot ok ?
2007-03-08T15:21:00.000Z	gnube	n-iCe	Sure. It is your computer! =)
2007-03-08T15:21:00.000Z	gnube	n-iCe	Are you sure it does not do that with Windows? Windows is notorious for paging all the time.
2007-03-08T15:22:00.000Z	n-iCe	gnube	nope doesn't pass
