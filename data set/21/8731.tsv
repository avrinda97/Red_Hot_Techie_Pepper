2006-01-28T13:25:00.000Z	metalsand		Can I edit my xorg.conf with a new driver?
2006-01-28T13:25:00.000Z	metalsand		Vesa works
2006-01-28T13:26:00.000Z	metalsand		but it's using i810.
2006-01-28T13:26:00.000Z	slavik	metalsand	you need to install the driver first ...
2006-01-28T13:26:00.000Z	metalsand	slavik	Isn't vesa installed by default?
2006-01-28T13:28:00.000Z	slavik	metalsand	I'd guess so
2006-01-28T13:28:00.000Z	slavik	metalsand	I thought you wanted some other driver
2006-01-28T13:29:00.000Z	metalsand	slavik	I do
2006-01-28T13:29:00.000Z	slavik	metalsand	so, you want to change the driver?
2006-01-28T13:29:00.000Z	metalsand	slavik	I want my resolution to work, and the driver I'm using is a piece of shit.
2006-01-28T13:29:00.000Z	metalsand	slavik	Yes
2006-01-28T13:30:00.000Z	slavik	metalsand	you want to switch back to vesa?
2006-01-28T13:30:00.000Z	metalsand	slavik	I've never used vesa, but that's what I want to use because I know my resolution works in vesa.
2006-01-28T13:30:00.000Z	slavik	metalsand	in the config file, find the area for the video
2006-01-28T13:30:00.000Z	metalsand	slavik	Do I just simply set vesa as the Driver: in xorg.conf?
2006-01-28T15:13:00.000Z	slavik	metalsand	you want kismet for wardriving :)
2006-01-28T15:13:00.000Z	metalsand	slavik	I can't get kismet to work :(
2006-01-28T15:13:00.000Z	metalsand	slavik	But on the bright side, I got my resolution to work :D
2006-01-28T15:13:00.000Z	slavik	metalsand	that sucks
2006-01-28T15:15:00.000Z	metalsand	slavik	You have any knowledge about wireless PCMCIA cards?
2006-01-28T15:15:00.000Z	slavik	metalsand	not really
