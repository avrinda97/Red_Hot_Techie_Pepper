2008-08-20T10:55:00.000Z	jimdandy	ValentineX	do you mean for use with other systems (such as windows), or in a Linux format? A vfat filesystem is what a usb stick usually comes with. How you create it should depend on the size of the stick (in MB/GB).
2008-08-20T10:56:00.000Z	jimdandy		ValentineX?
2008-08-20T10:57:00.000Z	ValentineX	jimdandy	i want to format for the both system use
2008-08-20T10:58:00.000Z	jimdandy	ValentineX	do you have any files on it you need? You should back them up before formatting.
2008-08-20T10:59:00.000Z	ValentineX	jimdandy	no i dont have any
2008-08-20T11:00:00.000Z	ValentineX	jimdandy	i am ready to format. for fat32 so it canbe used both for linux and windos
2008-08-20T11:01:00.000Z	jimdandy	ValentineX	what size is the drive?
2008-08-20T11:02:00.000Z	ValentineX	jimdandy	1GB
2008-08-20T11:03:00.000Z	jimdandy	ValentineX	insert the usb stick.. Open the terminal. Type 'dmesg -tail'.
2008-08-20T11:04:00.000Z	ValentineX	jimdandy	anything further after that?
2008-08-20T11:04:00.000Z	jimdandy	ValentineX	if a "disk" window pops up look in the left panel. You can right-click on the "1G disk" or whatever it is called, then click unmount.
2008-08-20T11:05:00.000Z	jimdandy		If no window pops up, don't worry. In the terminal output, look for a few messages at the end about /dev/sdb or /dev/sda or something similar, recognized as a usb device. Do you see it?
2008-08-20T11:06:00.000Z	ValentineX	jimdandy	and done?
2008-08-20T11:06:00.000Z	jimdandy	ValentineX	no you must find out what the device name of the usb device is, probably "/dev/sda" or "/dev/sdb". Do you see it?
2008-08-20T11:07:00.000Z	ValentineX		@jimdany i dont know what is that dev sda :s
2008-08-20T11:08:00.000Z	jimdandy	ValentineX	ok, type "ls /dev/sd*"
2008-08-20T11:10:00.000Z	ValentineX	jimdandy	i will type i am not at ubuntu then what will i get after typing that?
2008-08-20T11:11:00.000Z	jimdandy	ValentineX	you must find out if your drive is eg. /dev/sda or /dev/sdb. That will be homework. If you get this part wrong, the commands I tell you will hose the wrong drive.
2008-08-20T11:12:00.000Z	ValentineX	jimdandy	when i type ls /dev/sd* will it show that where is my drive?
2008-08-20T11:12:00.000Z	jimdandy	ValentineX	type "sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda" to check out the disk. It will tell you the size, among other things. For a 1G drive we're shooting for 1000MB or thereabouts. If it is way off, you've got the wrong disk.
2008-08-20T11:14:00.000Z	ValentineX	jimdandy	hmm ok thanks i am going to check that all restarting my pc so i can log in to ubuntu. thanks for help
