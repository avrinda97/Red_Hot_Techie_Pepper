2008-08-01T21:45:00.000Z	s0|		ok let me try this anotherway, I need to slip a driver in before I start to intall 8.04, can someone help walk me thorugh that
2008-08-01T21:47:00.000Z	s0|		ok, when I boot the 8.04 isntall sees the drives connected to the 1430SA, but it doesn't bloody see them as a raid. it sees them as idiviual disks
2008-08-01T21:47:00.000Z	MikeSeth	s0|	switch into a console and use the raid tools to mount the volume [I dont know for a fact that they're installed]
2008-08-01T21:48:00.000Z	s0|	MikeSeth	how does one do that?
2008-08-01T21:51:00.000Z	MikeSeth	s0|	ummm.. mdadm(1) iirc
2008-08-01T22:05:00.000Z	s0|	MikeSeth	I don't seem to follow,
2008-08-01T22:05:00.000Z	MikeSeth	s0|	mdadm(1) is [as far as I know] the cli interface used to operate raid volumes
2008-08-01T22:06:00.000Z	s0|	MikeSeth	I can only find the option to launch a shell and when that shell comes up it doens't know what mdadm is
2008-08-01T22:06:00.000Z	MikeSeth	s0|	oh well then mdadm isnt installed or i may be wrong about the name
2008-08-01T22:07:00.000Z	MikeSeth	s0|	try md
2008-08-01T22:07:00.000Z	MikeSeth	s0|	sorry I cant help you any more, never did this on Ubuntu myself
2008-08-01T22:08:00.000Z	MikeSeth	s0|	IMO there are boot time options for that, and you can also open the console soon after the install boots
2008-08-01T22:08:00.000Z	s0|	MikeSeth	what is the boot option to load a driver off a flash disk
2008-08-01T22:14:00.000Z	MikeSeth	s0|	doesnt the boot screen give you options?
2008-08-01T22:14:00.000Z	MikeSeth	s0|	what raid controller is this? or softraid?
2008-08-01T22:17:00.000Z	MikeSeth	s0|	hehe I just googled it and seems there's a lot of trouble with this one
2008-08-01T22:18:00.000Z	MikeSeth	s0|	umm it looks like you need binary firmware for the raid driver to work
2008-08-01T22:19:00.000Z	MikeSeth	s0|	apparently get the firmware from adaptec site
2008-08-01T22:19:00.000Z	s0|	MikeSeth	I have the firmware
2008-08-01T22:20:00.000Z	MikeSeth	s0|	I bet it's something in the boot screen options
2008-08-01T22:25:00.000Z	MikeSeth	s0|	not me, sorry
