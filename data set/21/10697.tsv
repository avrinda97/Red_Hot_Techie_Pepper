2005-09-01T12:28:00.000Z	carthik		hi, though I have added the backports repos to sources.list, i can't find the sun-j2re1.5 package there
2005-09-01T12:28:00.000Z	carthik		can someone let me know what i am doing wrong?
2005-09-01T12:29:00.000Z	Seveas	carthik	backports has problems
2005-09-01T12:29:00.000Z	carthik	Seveas	is this temporary, or are we in for a long run of problems?
2006-02-27T13:17:00.000Z	Seveas	carthik	sudo -i is shorter ;)
2006-02-27T13:17:00.000Z	carthik	Seveas	how dd yo do the smiley?
2006-02-27T13:17:00.000Z	Seveas	carthik	like this: 
2006-04-10T09:40:00.000Z	carthik	Seveas	yeah, you've done that to me before
2006-04-10T09:41:00.000Z	Seveas	carthik	rightclick on the url, select open in browser
2006-04-10T09:41:00.000Z	carthik	Seveas	i would like it to just open on a left click - is that possible, even?
2006-04-10T09:42:00.000Z	Seveas	carthik	no idea
2006-04-10T09:43:00.000Z	carthik	Seveas	Ctrl+Click does it :)
2006-04-10T15:22:00.000Z	Seveas	carthik	file a bug - it could be a bad initramfs
2006-04-10T15:22:00.000Z	Seveas	carthik	do you have /boot on a separate partition?
2006-04-10T15:23:00.000Z	carthik	Seveas	yes. I have a seperate partition for /boot - does this mean anything? And could help me with submitting the bugreport - what details should I include?
2006-04-10T15:24:00.000Z	Seveas	carthik	check whether that partition is full
2006-04-10T15:25:00.000Z	carthik	Seveas	on the contrary it has 201.65 MB free. Only about 80MB is used now.
2006-04-10T15:25:00.000Z	Seveas	carthik	hmm...
2006-04-10T15:27:00.000Z	carthik	Seveas	i am now booted in, without hotplug etc on that laptop. Are there any logs etc that I can use for  my bug report for the latest kernel boot issue (or are they lost now?)
2006-04-10T15:28:00.000Z	Seveas	carthik	they most likely aren't logged since it couldn't find the root disk - I suggest you file a bug
2006-04-10T15:28:00.000Z	carthik	Seveas	in package initramfs ?
