2010-10-19T12:03:00.000Z	ezra-s		why is telepathy the official messenger in Ubuntu? It is crap still
2010-10-19T12:04:00.000Z	ezra-s		yes
2010-10-19T12:04:00.000Z	ezra-s		sorry about that
2010-10-19T12:04:00.000Z	ezra-s		keep confusing the names
2010-10-19T12:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ezra-s	That only changed to the default quite recently from Pidgin.  Pidgin big :)
2010-10-19T12:05:00.000Z	ezra-s	sebsebseb	I think they made it official like two ubuntu releases ago
2010-10-19T12:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ezra-s	yeah since 9.10 if I remember correctly, also Ubuntu isn't the only distro where Empathy became the default,  I think most  Desktop Linux distros are doing Empathy by default now,  but Pidgin is still better for many people :)
2010-10-19T12:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ezra-s	sudo apt-get install pidgin
2010-10-19T12:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ezra-s	Empathy can do more, than just im, but  most of us  don't need those features, just im, so Pidgin :)
2010-10-19T12:07:00.000Z	ezra-s	sebsebseb	I already have it, just came to do a bit of harmless whining about empathy :)
2010-10-19T12:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ezra-s	maybe on the Gnome  IRC network
2010-10-19T12:15:00.000Z	ezra-s	sebsebseb	I based my whining is usage, you dummy ;P
2010-10-19T12:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ezra-s	right, and when I whine in here about features I don't like in Ubuntu based on useage of the distro for years,  I am probably still being off topic really :D
2010-10-19T12:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ezra-s	irc.gnome.org or something I think
2010-10-19T12:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ezra-s	no its okish,  I am just not that intrested in the Empathy vs Pidgin stuff
2010-10-19T12:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ezra-s	Pidgin is good, Epathy can be good,  and they don't both do the same stuff,  Empathy can do more
2010-10-19T12:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ezra-s	Pidgin is just a instant messaging and IRC program, Empathy can do more than that,  theres even a remote connect feature with Empathy
2010-10-19T12:19:00.000Z	ezra-s	sebsebseb	ohh, like vino/vinagre?
2010-10-19T12:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ezra-s	sure a bit like that, but maybe it uses its own thing instead of VNC
2010-10-19T12:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ezra-s	loasd of remote connect programs these days, even addon/s for Skype
2010-10-19T12:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ezra-s	you might be interested in freenx
