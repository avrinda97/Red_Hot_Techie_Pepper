2005-10-18T14:09:00.000Z	mcquaid		i guess sure, but i didn't think they'd backport libs
2005-10-18T14:11:00.000Z	mcquaid		to breezy? cool
2005-10-18T14:12:00.000Z	mcquaid		oh, well i thought i'd have to backport it then, or i'd be mixing sources
2005-10-18T14:14:00.000Z	mcphail	mcquaid	checkinstall is a useful tool
2006-08-31T06:23:00.000Z	mcphail	mcquaid	most repos hold previous versions of things
2006-08-31T06:23:00.000Z	mcquaid	mcphail	ok this is news to me, do you know how to do that with apt?
2006-08-31T06:23:00.000Z	mcphail	mcquaid	sudo aptitude package=versionnumber
2006-08-31T06:26:00.000Z	mcphail	mcquaid	my best advice to you is to downgrade and then disable the compiz repos. They are in a foul state at present.
2006-08-31T06:27:00.000Z	mcquaid	mcphail	it's kind of a weird situation, I have an old box with a voodoo3, I added the compriz sources and just grabbed libglmesa and a few others and then had hardware dri working
2006-08-31T06:30:00.000Z	mcphail	mcquaid	having the compiz repos break things which were once stable is not an unusual situation, i'm afraid
2006-08-31T06:31:00.000Z	mcquaid	mcphail	sorry didn't explain clearly, the v3 has never had hardware gl in dapper, the first time i added the compiz rep is what solved that
2006-08-31T06:32:00.000Z	mcphail	mcquaid	i understood :) I'm just saying that compiz _updates_ often break things
2006-08-31T06:33:00.000Z	mcphail	mcquaid	use the syntax i mentioed above if you know the version numbers
2006-08-31T06:35:00.000Z	mcphail	mcquaid	sorry - it is sudo aptitude install package=version (i missed out the install eariler)
2006-08-31T06:36:00.000Z	mcphail	mcquaid	it may or may not grab the others
2006-08-31T06:37:00.000Z	mcphail	mcquaid	hmm. The compiz repos are "unofficial". Perhaps the maintainer dumps old versions quickly
2006-08-31T06:38:00.000Z	mcquaid	mcphail	ya probably
2006-08-31T06:39:00.000Z	mcphail	mcquaid	check in /var/cache/apt/archives/ in case you still have it
2006-08-31T06:40:00.000Z	mcquaid	mcphail	ya I already checked, I cleared it for space
2006-08-31T06:40:00.000Z	mcphail	mcquaid	:(
2006-08-31T06:41:00.000Z	mcphail	mcquaid	i've got the official one installed. Sorry i can't help.
