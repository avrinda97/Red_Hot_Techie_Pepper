2008-06-01T18:59:00.000Z	Terabyte		Hey does anybody know how to stop openssh from starting up with ubuntu, I only want to start it when I need it, when I issue ssh start command, rather than autostarting and running in the background all the time
2008-06-01T19:00:00.000Z	jrib	Terabyte	System -> Administration -> Software Services
2008-12-06T21:32:00.000Z	jrib	Terabyte	what exactly is the .run file for?
2008-12-06T21:32:00.000Z	Terabyte	jrib	it's an executable and i need to run it only i don't have privalages i could open a command prompt, but i'm doing this freqently and finding the locations opening the prompt cding and all for a sudo command when the should be one there in the GUI is stupid
2008-12-06T21:33:00.000Z	jrib	Terabyte	you managed to write some long response and not answer my question.  You're doing something wrong if you are doing this frequently
2008-12-06T21:33:00.000Z	Terabyte	jrib	there are lots of situations when you are setting up a system that you need to be in privaliged mode
2008-12-06T21:34:00.000Z	Terabyte	jrib	is there a way to do it or not? in kde on mandriva theres a "open a terminal here" which saves some time
2008-12-06T21:34:00.000Z	Terabyte	jrib	in ubuntu there is no such thing
2008-12-06T21:34:00.000Z	jrib	Terabyte	nope.  You are doing something wrong honestly if you're doing that often.  If you need to run a series of commands as sudo, then use 'sudo -i'.  But you shouldn't be executing random .run files every minute
2008-12-06T21:35:00.000Z	jrib	Terabyte	you can install nautilus-open-terminal to get that
2008-12-06T21:35:00.000Z	Terabyte	jrib	not every minute, just every now and then, but because of the environment and equip i'm working with it takes a good 2 minutes to do stuff like that
2008-12-06T21:36:00.000Z	jrib	Terabyte	if you answer my original question about what .run this is, maybe we can tell you if there is a better way
2008-12-06T21:36:00.000Z	Terabyte	jrib	no but i need to install "extensions" for my virtual machine in ubuntu on virtualbox... and that requires me to do it
2008-12-06T21:36:00.000Z	jrib	Terabyte	sure, one time.
2008-12-06T21:37:00.000Z	Terabyte	jrib	yes one time.. and one time for other installations, and another installation, and another modification, i'm installing my system. when it's running i don't expect to do it
2008-12-06T21:37:00.000Z	jrib	Terabyte	you mean you have several installations so you have to install the extensions several times?
2008-12-06T21:38:00.000Z	Terabyte	jrib	correct
2008-12-06T21:38:00.000Z	Terabyte	jrib	and it's not the nicest environment to have to do this on
2008-12-06T21:38:00.000Z	Terabyte	jrib	but in general, how can i execute something in sudo mode from the gui without going into the command prompt and doin git
2008-12-06T21:38:00.000Z	jrib	Terabyte	is this virtualbox?  There's probably a better way to clone one installation after it already has extensions installed
2008-12-06T21:38:00.000Z	Terabyte	jrib	it's the same thing, one way is quicker.
