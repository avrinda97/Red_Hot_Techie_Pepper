2004-09-27T13:58:00.000Z	nawty		why is aptitude better than apt-* ? 
2004-09-27T13:59:00.000Z	mdz	nawty	it is a higher-level tool, it has an interactive interface, it has some additional features like removing packages which are no longer needed
2004-09-27T14:00:00.000Z	nawty	mdz	and it actually works ? :) 
2004-09-27T14:00:00.000Z	mdz	nawty	but more importantly, you can play minesweeper
2004-09-27T14:00:00.000Z	mdz	nawty	apt-get doesn't work for you?
2004-09-27T14:01:00.000Z	nawty	mdz	it does, im just concerned when things remove packages for me :) 
2004-09-27T14:01:00.000Z	mdz	nawty	oh, that
2004-09-27T14:01:00.000Z	mdz	nawty	it is actually fairly smart.  it records whether you explicitly installed a package, or whether it was installed to satisfy a dependency
2004-09-27T14:01:00.000Z	mdz	nawty	if it was installed to satisfy a dependency, and you remove the package which had the dependency, it removes the extra packages as well
2004-09-27T14:01:00.000Z	nawty	mdz	okay, ill take your word for it :) 
2004-09-28T14:29:00.000Z	mdz	nawty	ubuntu avoids that particular issue by supporting only apache2 :-)
2004-09-28T14:30:00.000Z	nawty	mdz	not true, im using ubuntu and i have it trying to install apache1 
2004-09-28T14:31:00.000Z	mdz	nawty	not true?
2004-09-28T14:31:00.000Z	nawty	mdz	i've had this ubuntu install try install apache1 numerous times :) 
2004-09-28T14:31:00.000Z	mdz	nawty	then you must have enabled universe in sources.list :-P
2004-09-28T14:31:00.000Z	mdz	nawty	which, as the comments explain, gives you access to unsupported packages
2004-09-28T14:32:00.000Z	nawty	mdz	yes, :) 
2004-09-28T14:32:00.000Z	mdz	nawty	apt-get install libapache2-mod-php4 if you want php
2004-09-28T14:33:00.000Z	nawty	mdz	i've done it already, although i'm rather certain that these things should be and could be more `streamlined` 
2004-09-28T14:34:00.000Z	mdz	nawty	agreed; we have some interesting plans in that department
2004-09-28T14:35:00.000Z	nawty	mdz	but you arent avoing the problem :)
