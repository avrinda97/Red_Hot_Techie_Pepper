2009-04-10T19:50:00.000Z	Shish_		ive followed all the proper steps to making my desktop cube a cube, but its a cylinder!!!  what did i do wrong!!? lol
2009-04-10T19:51:00.000Z	scunizi	Shish_	cylinder?  wow that would be cool
2009-04-10T19:51:00.000Z	Shish_	scunizi	yea it was cool for a bit.. lol
2009-04-10T19:51:00.000Z	scunizi	Shish_	the cube is like that too.. after a while it doesn't grow on you
2009-04-10T19:54:00.000Z	Shish_	scunizi	i love it tho, to have it to show off to everyone else who doesnt believe in ubuntu/linux
2009-04-10T19:57:00.000Z	scunizi	Shish_	include the nick in the line.. type the first few characters and hit TAB to auto complete
2009-04-10T19:57:00.000Z	Shish_	scunizi	thank you
2009-04-10T19:57:00.000Z	scunizi	Shish_	did you install ccsm?
2009-04-10T19:59:00.000Z	Shish_	scunizi	 yessir, installed that, then went into it, and enabled desktop cube, 3d cube, disabled the desktop background thing, put up 4 workspaces on the bottom left
2009-04-10T20:00:00.000Z	scunizi	Shish_	ah.. the workspaces on the bottom left don't do much with cube.. the workspaces are adjusted in ccsm
2009-04-10T20:01:00.000Z	Shish_	scunizi	yea i was reading a forum that said not to do the ccsm option, but to do the bottom right?  anyways, i tried both ways, they are both adjusted together anyways...?
2009-04-10T20:02:00.000Z	scunizi	Shish_	under general settings/Desktop size put 4 1 1
2009-04-10T20:02:00.000Z	Shish_	scunizi	411, set -- still a weird cylinder... lol
2009-04-10T20:03:00.000Z	scunizi	Shish_	I'm stuck.. you might ask in #ubuntu-effects which actually takes you to #compiz I think
2009-04-10T20:04:00.000Z	Shish_	scunizi	sorry for this question, how do i get there? lol what do i type?
2009-04-10T20:04:00.000Z	scunizi	Shish_	type /join #ubuntu-effects
2009-04-10T20:04:00.000Z	Shish_	scunizi	thank you so much for ur time, really appreciate it!
