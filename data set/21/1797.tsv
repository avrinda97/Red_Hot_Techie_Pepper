2011-04-03T12:03:00.000Z	XATRIX		hi guys, can i use atd daemon, for scheduling some commands every 30min ?
2011-04-03T12:05:00.000Z	Loshki	XATRIX	you can, but I think crontab is better for recurring jobs...
2011-04-03T12:06:00.000Z	XATRIX	Loshki	why so ?
2011-04-03T12:07:00.000Z	XATRIX		ok may i remove atd from my system, and install cron instead of atd ?
2011-04-03T12:08:00.000Z	Loshki	XATRIX	does atd allow you to schedule recurring jobs?
2011-04-03T12:09:00.000Z	XATRIX	Loshki	i have no idea... that's why i asking you here
2011-04-03T12:09:00.000Z	XATRIX		i never used it
2011-04-03T12:11:00.000Z	Loshki	XATRIX	well, I don't think atd makes it easy to schedule recurring jobs, so crontab is preferable. Feel free to get a second opinion...

2011-04-03T12:12:00.000Z	XATRIX	Loshki	ok, so, can i safely remove atd from my system ?
2011-04-03T12:13:00.000Z	Loshki	XATRIX	in theory, but I've never tried it, so no guarantees...
2011-04-03T12:14:00.000Z	Loshki		!info at
2011-04-03T12:15:00.000Z	Loshki		!skype
2011-04-03T12:17:00.000Z	XATRIX		hm....if i try to "apt-get remove at" it asks me to remove "at ubuntu-standard". is it safe to remove this all ?
2011-04-03T12:21:00.000Z	Loshki	XATRIX	why are you bothering removing atd. To save 224kB?
2011-04-03T12:27:00.000Z	XATRIX		guys, how to disable atd daemon? it is not listed in services/runlevels... but it still started in processes
2011-04-03T12:35:00.000Z	Loshki	XATRIX	it's an 'upstart' job, so it's configured by /etc/init/atd.conf. I forget the details...
2011-04-03T12:38:00.000Z	XATRIX	Loshki	yeah, is possible to disable it ?
2011-04-03T12:39:00.000Z	XATRIX		and how to disable ipv6 completely in system ?
2011-04-03T12:40:00.000Z	Loshki	XATRIX	easier to just do: sudo mv /usr/sbin/atd /usr/sbin/atd.orig, then reboot...
