2010-05-20T02:22:00.000Z	FriedrichMan		is there a way to boot to windows from linux? like if I was opening a new terminal...with windows
2010-05-20T02:23:00.000Z	FriedrichMan		nope
2010-05-20T02:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	FriedrichMan	Windows on another computer?
2010-05-20T03:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	FriedrichMan	Fluxbox,  uhmm  loads of them to choose from
2010-05-20T03:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	FriedrichMan	messaged wrong one
2010-05-26T21:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	FriedrichMan	Flash is a propritary format, there are not many opensource programs that can make it
2010-05-26T21:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	FriedrichMan	Flash is not cool
2010-05-26T21:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	FriedrichMan	Flash is a tool, so only should be used with proper good reason really
2010-05-26T21:58:00.000Z	FriedrichMan	sebsebseb	I am trying to design a cool website... isn't that a proper reason?
2010-05-26T21:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	FriedrichMan	depends on the website your wanting to make
2010-05-26T21:59:00.000Z	FriedrichMan	sebsebseb	a cool one with moving stuff and fx
2010-05-26T21:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	FriedrichMan	in other words a website for your friends?
2010-05-26T21:59:00.000Z	FriedrichMan	sebsebseb	a website for a a music production enterprise
2010-05-26T22:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	FriedrichMan	ok maybe for that, but don't over do the Flash or  animated gifs
2010-05-26T22:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	FriedrichMan	right uhmm ok making Flash on a Linux distro, thinking
2010-05-26T22:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	FriedrichMan	I can't think of a program that can do it, but there may be something, but in that case only for basic Flash
2010-05-26T22:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	FriedrichMan	so you may want to  Wine  Adobe Flash and use that,  or Windows virtual machine it
2010-05-26T22:04:00.000Z	FriedrichMan	sebsebseb	. I might try some vmware... though it's a netbook ...maybe I should rethink this all over
2010-05-26T22:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	FriedrichMan	Virtualbox :)  and how much RAM does the netbook have?
2010-05-26T22:05:00.000Z	FriedrichMan	sebsebseb	2G
2010-05-26T22:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	FriedrichMan	as far as I know vm's don't work well on a netbook if at all depending on the hardware.  altough if your netbook has 2GB RAM, that doesn't sound like a netbook to me, more like a small lap top
