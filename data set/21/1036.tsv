2011-03-02T17:48:00.000Z	fidyduce		i need some help with cli
2011-03-02T17:48:00.000Z	jrib	fidyduce	best to just ask the channel your actual question (on a single line)
2011-03-02T17:48:00.000Z	fidyduce		so how do i incorporate multiple dev's into one command?
2011-03-02T17:49:00.000Z	fidyduce		yes i know what cli is lol
2011-03-02T17:49:00.000Z	jrib	fidyduce	what is a "dev"?
2011-03-02T17:49:00.000Z	fidyduce		so like /dev/sda;/dev/sdb?
2011-03-02T17:49:00.000Z	jrib	fidyduce	what exactly are you trying to execute?
2011-03-02T17:50:00.000Z	fidyduce	jrib	i am not trying to be a pain, but there are things i have to be vague about... is there a RFC i can read or some basic beginner cli doc's i can look over?
2011-03-02T17:50:00.000Z	fidyduce		i know some stuff in cli just enough to get my self into trouble sadly :(
2011-03-02T17:51:00.000Z	jrib	fidyduce	well the answer to your question is it depends on the command you are executing, thus my question
2011-03-02T17:51:00.000Z	fidyduce	jrib	ok, ever hear of a tool called UPT or work with it?
2011-03-02T17:52:00.000Z	fidyduce		then there you have it lol
2011-03-02T17:52:00.000Z	jrib	fidyduce	no
2011-03-02T17:52:00.000Z	fidyduce		seems nobody outside of my profession knows of it

2011-03-02T17:53:00.000Z	jrib	fidyduce	read its man page/documentation.  Worst case scenario, use a for loop if the program doesn't support passing multiple arguments and doing what you want it to do
