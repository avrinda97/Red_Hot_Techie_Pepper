2006-03-03T17:06:00.000Z	redblade		Hi, I'm having a bit of trouble with MySQL
2006-03-03T17:06:00.000Z	redblade		error: 'Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/tmp/mysql.sock' (2)'
2006-03-03T17:07:00.000Z	redblade		I'm not sure what to do.
2006-03-03T17:07:00.000Z	cafuego	redblade	dapper?
2006-03-03T17:08:00.000Z	cafuego	redblade	Ok, well, the mysql server rocket is actually in /var/lib/mysql/
2006-03-03T17:11:00.000Z	redblade	cafuego	I'm not sure what you mean, I need to make sure that MySQL is running
2006-03-03T17:14:00.000Z	redblade	cafuego	is there anything else that would work?
2006-03-09T11:34:00.000Z	cafuego	redblade	mysqladmin shouldn;t be in /usr/local if you installed it properly.
2006-03-09T11:35:00.000Z	cafuego	redblade	Undo, use the pakaged version.
2006-03-09T11:36:00.000Z	redblade	cafuego	how do I undo?
2006-03-09T11:36:00.000Z	cafuego	redblade	Well, it's in /usr/local, so maybe you can rm -f the binaries. You can then install using 'sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client'.
2006-03-09T11:37:00.000Z	cafuego	redblade	There should be no problem simply copying the databse files to /var/lib/mysql
2006-03-09T11:39:00.000Z	cafuego	redblade	Well, it's in /usr/local, so maybe you can rm -f the binaries. You can then install using 'sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client'.
2006-03-09T11:39:00.000Z	redblade	cafuego	rm -f?
2006-03-09T11:40:00.000Z	cafuego	redblade	Delete the mysl stuff that got installed when you ran 'make install'.
2006-03-09T11:44:00.000Z	redblade	cafuego	It looks like about 300 files got created
2006-03-09T12:28:00.000Z	cafuego	redblade	Depends on the disk.
2006-03-09T12:28:00.000Z	cafuego	redblade	Also, you probably need temperature, not speed.
2006-03-09T12:29:00.000Z	redblade	cafuego	temeperature?
2006-03-09T12:29:00.000Z	cafuego	redblade	Yes, ignition temperature.
2006-03-09T12:30:00.000Z	cafuego	redblade	I cna bun DATA/AUDIO at up to 48x (max) but Ubuntu CD's don't like going at over 8x.
