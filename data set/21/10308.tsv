2005-04-09T16:07:00.000Z	dabugas	synd	newer -> better unless you have an old pc, in which case staying behind may be helpful (the win 98 vs win xp sort of thing)
2005-04-09T16:08:00.000Z	dabugas	synd	if you know what you are doing upgrading is faster, but you may break certain things
2005-04-09T16:22:00.000Z	dabugas	synd	i told a friend to "fuck the fuck off" when he mentioned it today. so, i don't think i'll try it. i just tried windows xp last month (for the first and last time). nothing like a good linux system
2005-04-09T16:52:00.000Z	dabugas	synd	an old WHAT?
2005-04-09T16:54:00.000Z	synd	dabugas	well.. I have the motherboard and the athlon chip left.. i can sell it to you!
2005-04-09T16:54:00.000Z	dabugas	synd	i hope there's a hell for people like you... where you type lots and lots of confusing numbers in excel spreadsheets and then... it all gets erased... and you have to do it again.... BUWAHAHAHAHAHA! :pppp
2005-04-09T16:55:00.000Z	synd	dabugas	lol! being a accounting/computer engineering dual major.. that day will come
2005-04-09T16:55:00.000Z	dabugas	synd	i can find cheap athlons... but i'm a rather broke college student. i rely on donations. (the computer i have is my brother's old one)
2005-04-09T16:56:00.000Z	dabugas	synd	i'm an english major... but i'm working as a secretary.. .that day is already here. tomorrow, in fact :(
2005-04-09T16:56:00.000Z	synd	dabugas	ill send you an old celeron 600Mhz
2005-04-09T16:57:00.000Z	dabugas	synd	that's quite a few Hz more than what i have
2005-04-09T16:58:00.000Z	synd	dabugas	i actually yanked the 10GB HDD from that computer (its an emachines) and put it on my main PC to run ubuntu
2005-04-09T16:59:00.000Z	dabugas	synd	i'm actually quite happy with my HDs. i have a fairly old 6 GB hd which i use for my os. a hardy hd which has been around for half-a-decade without a single problem and a 20 gb for backups/dvds/mp3s/etc
2005-04-09T05:01:00.000Z	synd	dabugas	true. i remember the days when I first heard the word Gigbyte. I remember thinking "why the hell would anyone want a whole GB of storage?!"
2005-04-09T05:01:00.000Z	dabugas	synd	ditto. those were strange times indeed. we'll be telling this stuff to our children and they won't believe us. my father used to work with punch cards. huh? who remembers THAT?
2005-04-09T05:01:00.000Z	synd	dabugas	I was like "jeeze, i bet bill gates has like 4-5 GB on his computer!"
2005-04-09T05:03:00.000Z	dabugas	synd	what was your first computer?
2005-04-09T05:06:00.000Z	synd	dabugas	well i remember when I was in the 1st-2nd grade we had really old school Apple's.. cant remember but they were beige (im 18 now). but the very first computer my family owned (got it back in 93) was a Packard Bell 66MHz Intel (not even pentium), 8MB RAM, 2x CD ROM, floppy, 250MB HDD
