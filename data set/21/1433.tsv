2010-09-17T06:26:00.000Z	mmoebius	uLinux	What size do you want for /dev/sda5 ?
2010-09-17T06:27:00.000Z	uLinux	mmoebius	I want to use those unallocated 30gb..
2010-09-17T06:29:00.000Z	mmoebius	uLinux	You want to use the unallocated Partition before /dev/sda2 , right ?
2010-09-17T06:30:00.000Z	mmoebius	uLinux	That is not easily possible because /dev/sda2 is an extended partition and will AFAIK not move whern there are other partitions inside it.
2010-09-17T06:30:00.000Z	mmoebius	uLinux	is there data in the ext4 FS  that needs to be retained ?
2010-09-17T06:31:00.000Z	mmoebius	uLinux	Otherwise, you could just kill all partitions and re-setup them fresh and clean
2010-09-17T06:32:00.000Z	uLinux	mmoebius	yes .. it seems I have to reinstall everything again just because I had windows installed .. really lame
2010-09-17T06:32:00.000Z	mmoebius	uLinux	Well, not necessarily
2010-09-17T06:35:00.000Z	mmoebius	uLinux	You have data (an installed os) in the ext4 fs, right ?
2010-09-17T06:35:00.000Z	uLinux	mmoebius	i dont know man it's data (documents, music etc
2010-09-17T06:37:00.000Z	mmoebius	uLinux	There is of course the option to shift the whole filesystem by hand. But the procedure is rather dangerous. Would it suffice for you if you could mount the remaining 30gb e.g. like /extra30gb ?
2010-09-17T06:38:00.000Z	uLinux	mmoebius	no I dont want that
2010-09-17T06:38:00.000Z	mmoebius	uLinux	Even if you use gparted, wouldf you have a backup of the stuff ? Using gparted can lead to catastrophic failures if something unexpected happens
2010-09-17T06:39:00.000Z	mmoebius	uLinux	You don't want waht ? Shifting by hand or mounting the extra space ?
2010-09-17T06:40:00.000Z	uLinux	mmoebius	I dont a separate partition for the 30gb tks for the help anyway
2010-09-17T06:41:00.000Z	mmoebius	uLinux	you could try duplicating the existing filesystem to the unoccupied partition if it fits there. then you use that and later, you kill /dev/sda5, then you expand the now existing partition (dev/sda1 to fill the wohle drive
2010-09-17T06:42:00.000Z	mmoebius	uLinux	Of course you have to be lucky,  i.e. /dev/sda5 has to "fit" in the first partition
2010-09-17T06:45:00.000Z	mmoebius	uLinux	try 'update-grub'
