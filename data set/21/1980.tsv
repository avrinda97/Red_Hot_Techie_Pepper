2010-02-25T23:41:00.000Z	mgolisch	avemaria	what error message?
2010-02-25T23:42:00.000Z	avemaria	mgolisch	cant read the error screen is all garbled/distorted
2010-02-25T23:43:00.000Z	mgolisch	avemaria	look at your dpkg.log and install the package(s) again
2010-02-25T23:44:00.000Z	avemaria	mgolisch	i tried that it shows blank screen
2010-02-25T23:44:00.000Z	mgolisch	avemaria	maybe try f2-f8 and see if any other console has something
2010-02-25T23:45:00.000Z	avemaria	mgolisch	nothing on f2-f8
2010-02-25T23:46:00.000Z	mgolisch	avemaria	probably
2010-02-25T23:48:00.000Z	mgolisch	avemaria	boot the cd, then mount your root filesystem and chroot into it
2010-02-25T23:48:00.000Z	mgolisch	avemaria	whats the exact name of the package(s) you removed?
2010-02-25T23:49:00.000Z	mgolisch	avemaria	maybe start by booting the cd and looking for the dpkg.log on your root filesystem it will have the package names of the removed packages
2010-02-25T23:54:00.000Z	avemaria	mgolisch	i installed it through live cd. So can i mount my old root partition through live environment?
2010-02-25T23:58:00.000Z	mgolisch	avemaria	yeah its probably even listed in the filebrowser, if not mount it using the mount command
2010-02-26T00:00:00.000Z	mgolisch	avemaria	yeah mount root filesystem, chroot, run apt-get in the chroot env
2010-02-26T00:06:00.000Z	mgolisch	avemaria	got the filesystem mounted? or do you need help?
2010-02-26T00:21:00.000Z	mgolisch	avemaria	hm, its not that hard usualy, i can try to guide you through that if you want
2010-02-26T00:22:00.000Z	mgolisch	avemaria	unless you didnt do much with that ubuntu install yet, then a reinstall would probably be easier
