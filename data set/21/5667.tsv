2008-05-08T06:17:00.000Z	sFEARs	mauro	we need to get you a grub boot menu so that you can load boot options when you boot
2008-05-08T06:17:00.000Z	mauro	sFEARs	you still there?
2008-05-08T06:17:00.000Z	sFEARs	mauro	do you have a /boot/grub/menu.lst file
2008-05-08T06:18:00.000Z	sFEARs		there may be an easier way to do this, but i'm not sure what it is, once you have a grub boot menu i'm not sure how to boot without it, it shoudln't hurt anything though mauro
2008-05-08T06:18:00.000Z	mauro	sFEARs	yes, i have this file
2008-05-08T06:19:00.000Z	sFEARs		ok mauro pastebin that file
2008-05-08T06:20:00.000Z	sFEARs		can you hit escape to show the grub boot menu if it is hidden?
2008-05-08T06:20:00.000Z	sFEARs		windows, how dare you use such language!, why would i need to reinstall windows?
2008-05-08T06:21:00.000Z	sFEARs		nah... mauro needs to boot with force=apic
2008-05-08T06:23:00.000Z	mauro	sFEARs	http://paste.ubuntu.com/10847/
2008-05-08T06:24:00.000Z	sFEARs	mauro	when you reboot, hit escape a few times at first boot until it brings up the grub boot menu.. from the grub boot menu you can use the force=acip option it told you you needed to use
2008-05-08T06:25:00.000Z	sFEARs		there should be an option in there to hit C for command line mauro, in the grub menu.. from the grub menu command line type in force=apic or whatever it was and see if that eliminates your error, if it does you can permanently add that boot option to your grub file
2008-05-08T06:28:00.000Z	mauro	sFEARs	ok
