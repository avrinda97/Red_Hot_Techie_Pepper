2007-05-17T06:22:00.000Z	funkyHat		I have 1.2GB of ram and I'm finding that gets used up after about 6 hours of just normal use... it doesn't seem to be confined to one app slowly keeping more and more stuff, a bunch of things seem to be to blame...
2007-05-17T06:22:00.000Z	funkyHat		Anyone else getting problems like that? (I don't know how people with less memory cope!!)
2007-05-17T06:22:00.000Z	wxq2378	funkyHat	youre sure its used by a program and not just cache/buffers?
2007-05-17T06:23:00.000Z	funkyHat	wxq2378	yes, I know about memory caching and it's not that
2007-05-17T06:23:00.000Z	funkyHat	wxq2378	in fact I've just turned the computer on (<10 minutes ago) and already 50% is used and the other 50% is filled by the cache
2007-05-17T06:24:00.000Z	wxq2378	funkyHat	my pc runs some time with a few apps open 27% of 2GB used 33% cache (gnome system monitor applet)
2007-05-17T06:26:00.000Z	funkyHat	wxq2378	I suppose the solution is gonna be replace my 256MB chip with a second 1GB chip :(
2007-05-17T06:27:00.000Z	wxq2378	funkyHat	well if the memory consumption is not raising constantly it should be fine. it it raises w/o starting any application could mean that one app has a memory leak.
2007-05-17T06:28:00.000Z	funkyHat	wxq2378	yeah it rises steadily as I use the computer... quite likely firefox (or one of my extensions) has a memory leak I suppose :(
2007-05-17T06:28:00.000Z	wxq2378	funkyHat	did you check the memory usage of the prcesses using the system monitor or "ps"? maybe you see whats using too much
2007-05-17T06:29:00.000Z	funkyHat	wxq2378	yeah I did, as I said it seems to be a combination of a few... firefox and evolution-data-server rank quite high... Xorg takes up an awful lot too
2007-05-17T06:29:00.000Z	wxq2378	funkyHat	well then disable all extensions termprarily and see what happens, then reactivate one after the other
2007-05-17T06:29:00.000Z	funkyHat	wxq2378	ahhhhh... that's a massive pain :P
2007-05-17T06:30:00.000Z	wxq2378	funkyHat	you can also do a binary search, activating halv of them, then the other halv etc. if there are so many ;-)
2007-05-17T06:31:00.000Z	wxq2378	funkyHat	it also might be that a site has a java applet thats buggy...
2007-05-17T06:31:00.000Z	funkyHat	wxq2378	that's a good idea... and yeah could be a java applet although I have noscript running so I would have had to enabled that site
2007-05-17T06:32:00.000Z	funkyHat	wxq2378	Ooh I've just found a firefox extension for monitoring memory leaks ;) I'll try it!
2007-05-17T06:33:00.000Z	wxq2378	funkyHat	noscript is just for java script i think, the java applet is a separate checkbox. btw i have 34 tabs open and stable memory consumption. but no java and flash plugins
2007-05-17T06:33:00.000Z	funkyHat	wxq2378	yeah but you can set it up to also disable java/flash etc.
2007-05-17T06:37:00.000Z	funkyHat	wxq2378	tbh I think a lot of work needs to be done on memory consumption in Linux apps in general... wish I was in a position where I could help with that!
2007-05-17T06:39:00.000Z	wxq2378	funkyHat	the numbers are not always telling the truth. sometines it shows libraries that are used by more than one program. so the real memory consumption is not as large
