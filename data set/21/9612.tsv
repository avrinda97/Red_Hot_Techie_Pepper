2005-08-22T07:50:00.000Z	etker		anyone awake ?
2005-08-22T07:51:00.000Z	etker		ok ... so i'm trying to connect to a ubuntu box and ssh doesnt wanna play. i suspect that sshd isnt even started or installed. if we omit the fact that one can know whether a fresh ubuntu comes with or without sshd, how does one check whether its running in *nix ?
2005-08-22T07:52:00.000Z	bimberi	etker	a fresh install has no sshd
2005-08-22T07:53:00.000Z	bimberi	etker	install the openssh-server package
2005-08-22T07:54:00.000Z	etker	bimberi	ok ... but let me be more clear: if we forget for a second that both you and i know that a fresh ubuntu has no sshd. How would i check if its running or not ?
2005-08-22T07:54:00.000Z	etker	bimberi	and by the way: when i install the openssh-server package ... will it also be added to some sort of startup-file, so that its always started on boot ?
2005-08-22T07:57:00.000Z	bimberi	etker	sorry - got called away
2005-08-22T07:58:00.000Z	etker	bimberi	np
2005-08-22T07:59:00.000Z	bimberi	etker	ps aux | grep sshd <-- will tell you if it is running
2005-08-22T08:00:00.000Z	bimberi	etker	and yes, the install will set up scripts in /etc/init.d and /etc/rc*.d to start sshd on boot :)
2005-08-22T08:00:00.000Z	etker	bimberi	yup, got a response similar to that by someone else here ... thanks
2005-08-22T08:00:00.000Z	etker	bimberi	ok great
2005-08-22T08:00:00.000Z	bimberi	etker	k - i got called away and didn't read my scrollback closely
2005-08-22T08:03:00.000Z	bimberi	etker	if the current version of a package is still on the install CD it will install from that (saves time/bandwidth)
2005-08-22T08:03:00.000Z	etker	bimberi	ah shite ... ok ... hmmm  could i override this?
2005-08-22T08:04:00.000Z	bimberi	etker	edit your sources.list and comment out the "deb cdrom" line (usually at the top)
2005-08-22T08:05:00.000Z	etker	bimberi	ah ofcourse ... sounds logical. will try
2005-08-22T08:05:00.000Z	bimberi	etker	then apt-get update
2005-08-22T08:09:00.000Z	etker	bimberi	worked like a charm, got sshd installed and running and can connect!
2005-08-22T08:09:00.000Z	etker	bimberi	thanks for help
2005-08-22T08:12:00.000Z	bimberi	etker	yw :)
