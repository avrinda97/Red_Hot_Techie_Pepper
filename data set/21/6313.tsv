2007-05-01T12:02:00.000Z	Adsims2001		Does anyone else here have a wlan card with an rtl818x series chipset?
2007-05-01T12:02:00.000Z	Adsims2001		Did you ever have problems with it in Ubuntu?
2007-05-01T12:04:00.000Z	Adsims2001		I tried that, just ten minutes ago
2007-05-01T12:04:00.000Z	Adsims2001		Mine is PCI.
2007-05-01T12:04:00.000Z	Adsims2001		Ha, this workstation will crash any minute now due to those drivers ;_;
2007-05-01T12:04:00.000Z	Adsims2001		The natives.
2007-05-01T12:05:00.000Z	Adsims2001		the problem is that the rtl8180 chipset *sucks* and no one has the hardware to debug the drivers, or for that matter, no one really cares. Ha
2007-05-01T12:05:00.000Z	Adsims2001		I also hate wireless, but I don't have a choice, it's the only option ;_;
2007-05-01T12:06:00.000Z	Parmenion	Adsims2001	ive got no choice here as well ... ive ran out of ethernet wire
2007-05-01T12:06:00.000Z	Adsims2001		I do have a few other cards I could use, anyway. I think i'll just try those instead of dealing with this one.
2007-05-01T12:07:00.000Z	Adsims2001		You could try iwconfig
2007-05-01T12:07:00.000Z	Parmenion	Adsims2001	you cant get your wireless to work ?
2007-05-01T12:07:00.000Z	Adsims2001		it's network manager from the command line
2007-05-01T12:07:00.000Z	Adsims2001	Parmenion	It works, but has severe bugs like crashing the whole system
2007-05-01T12:07:00.000Z	Adsims2001		if i try to start a torrent or download more than one file at a time
2007-05-01T12:07:00.000Z	Adsims2001		and sometimes just randomly
2007-05-01T12:08:00.000Z	Adsims2001		the problem is an old, unmaintained driver for the r818x series by realtek
2007-05-01T12:08:00.000Z	Adsims2001		so i don't reccomend using cards with that chipset with ubuntu.
2007-05-01T12:08:00.000Z	Parmenion	Adsims2001	O.o thats weird ... manufacturer ? have you tried ndiswrapper ?
2007-05-01T12:08:00.000Z	Adsims2001		Yeah, I tried NDISwrapper a little bit but I should play around with it a bit more before I give up.
2007-05-01T12:09:00.000Z	Parmenion	Adsims2001	have you tried ndiswrapper ?
