2010-04-05T02:48:00.000Z	Alcor		i was a sys admin for 14 years on a main frame Unix system.  I simply asked why.  There is not a unix system out there that doesnt have a root passwd
2010-04-05T02:49:00.000Z	Alcor		so I was simply trying to understand your reasoning behind what you were saying
2010-04-05T02:50:00.000Z	Alcor		My Ubuntu came with a root passwd already setup - That means somebody knows it - So I simply reset it.  No security risk...
2010-04-05T02:51:00.000Z	Alcor		Now, I am the only one that knows it
2010-04-05T02:51:00.000Z	Alcor		it could be random
2010-04-05T02:52:00.000Z	acicula	Alcor	how did you determine a passwd was already set?
2010-04-05T02:53:00.000Z	Alcor		my ubunto came from OSDisc.com on a CDrom - just stick it in and it loads up.
2010-04-05T02:53:00.000Z	Alcor	acicula	I looked in the /etc shadow file
2010-04-05T02:54:00.000Z	Alcor	acicula	it looked to have about an 80 character encryption
2010-04-05T02:54:00.000Z	acicula	Alcor	hmm odd, you can compare with the md5sums from the ubuntu release site to see if the iamge you have has been modified
2010-04-05T02:56:00.000Z	Alcor	acicula	thx -- it seems there are some differences on my box compared to what you guys talk about
2010-04-05T02:58:00.000Z	Alcor	acicula	I asked the other night if anyone loaded ubunto from the disk I did.  No takers, and OSDisc.com isn' returning emails,
2010-04-05T02:59:00.000Z	acicula	Alcor	maybe try a cdimage from another ubuntu mirror and verify the image matches the released md5sums then?
2010-04-05T02:59:00.000Z	Alcor	acicula	Sorry if I upset ne1
2010-04-05T03:00:00.000Z	Alcor	acicula	I'm new to Ubuntu.  I'm happy to have it up and running.
2010-04-05T03:01:00.000Z	Alcor	acicula	thx for the info
2010-04-05T03:01:00.000Z	acicula	Alcor	yw
2010-04-05T03:03:00.000Z	acicula	Alcor	using sudo>
2010-04-05T03:03:00.000Z	acicula		i meant Akpsp
2010-04-05T03:05:00.000Z	Alcor	acicula	i use sudo alot.  Only after crashes and going into maintenance do I issue root and then run fsck
2010-04-05T03:06:00.000Z	Alcor	acicula	old habits are hard to break
