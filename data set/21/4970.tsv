2009-10-01T18:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	te	edit /boot/grub/menu.lst   and you will see a section relating to windows, you need to make sure this is correct
2009-10-01T18:37:00.000Z	te	ActionParsnip	sda3 is my windows partition
2009-10-01T18:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	te	Is windows installed on sda4?
2009-10-01T18:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	te	grub partition numbers start at 0, not 1
2009-10-01T18:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	te	yes
2009-10-01T18:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	te	you can live edit the grub line using e to edit the entry, once you know what works, boot to linux and change the file so the boot is correct
2009-10-01T18:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	te	hmmm, you could reinstate the windows boot loader, then install grub again to make it pickup the boot
2009-10-01T18:40:00.000Z	te	ActionParsnip	i installed to /dev/sda
2009-10-01T18:42:00.000Z	te	ActionParsnip	nothing?
2009-10-01T18:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	te	i dont dual boot as i have no requirement for windows but thats the crux of a dual boot
2011-03-10T09:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	te	no true, it is in some cases
2011-03-10T11:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	te	wicd also has a cli interface with wicd-curses so is great for servers :)
2011-03-10T11:40:00.000Z	te	ActionParsnip	Very good.  Thanks for info.
2011-03-10T11:41:00.000Z	te	ActionParsnip	I mostly just use it on my laptop.
