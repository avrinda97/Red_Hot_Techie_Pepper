2006-01-09T16:00:00.000Z	j2daosh		... not familiar with that brand... but i think it might have something to do with your router...

2006-01-09T16:03:00.000Z	j2daosh		div... how old is your computer?
2006-01-09T16:05:00.000Z	DivGradCurl	j2daosh	This computer is 4.5 years old, but the one I've been using (adjacent, Ubuntu locally installed) is ~3 years.  But I talked to tech support and they said that it did not have USB booting support.  I also consider this to be a question with wider implications and if a possible method is found would like to post it for others to use in the future.
2006-01-09T16:11:00.000Z	DivGradCurl	j2daosh	Another 'tab' opened up with a message from you.  I've been typing stuff there instead of in this room but aren't sure that you're getting my messages.
2006-01-09T16:13:00.000Z	j2daosh	DivGradCurl	 nope... haven't receieved any messages... look at the ubuntu servers tab and see if it is saying you can do prv msg because your not registared
2006-01-09T16:13:00.000Z	DivGradCurl	j2daosh	Oh, give me a minute to search help on information how to register, etc.
2006-01-09T16:14:00.000Z	j2daosh	DivGradCurl	just do /msg nickserv register "password goes here (no quotes)"
2006-01-09T16:14:00.000Z	j2daosh	DivGradCurl	then identify urself using the pass
2006-01-09T16:18:00.000Z	DivGradCurl	j2daosh	/msg nickserv identify rocket
2006-01-12T13:17:00.000Z	j2daosh	DivGradCurl	hows it going... find anything on your compaq mobo?
2006-01-12T13:17:00.000Z	DivGradCurl	j2daosh	 Heya!
2006-01-12T13:18:00.000Z	DivGradCurl	j2daosh	 Sort of.  The grub isn't the problem.  I did a ton of research, and found a probably solution here: http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-fireboot.html
2006-01-12T13:19:00.000Z	DivGradCurl	j2daosh	 The "two-phase boot" section is the main point of interest.  It seems possible but relies on tweaking kernels and building/burning disk images.
2006-01-12T13:20:00.000Z	DivGradCurl	j2daosh	 Satan and odat were giving me some advice.  Any of you three curious to help me obtain/edit/build the proper kernel?
