2009-07-13T11:05:00.000Z	nsgn		basically where can i find an nvidia driver version older than the current (ONLY) one nvidia offers?
2009-07-13T11:05:00.000Z	Slart	nsgn	there isn't a driver archive at their site?
2009-07-13T11:06:00.000Z	nsgn	Slart	i cant find it
2009-07-13T11:07:00.000Z	nsgn	Slart	the site just seems to show the current one
2009-07-13T11:07:00.000Z	Slart	nsgn	http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux_display_archive.html
2009-07-13T11:07:00.000Z	nsgn	Slart	correction: i can't find CUDA drivers. i need CUDA
2009-07-13T11:07:00.000Z	nsgn		sorry
2009-07-13T11:07:00.000Z	nsgn		wasnt clear
2009-07-13T11:10:00.000Z	Slart	nsgn	Is there a separate CUDA driver? doesn't the regular linux display driver support CUDA?
2009-07-13T11:12:00.000Z	nsgn	Slart	i'm almost positive you have to have a CUDA specific driver
2009-07-13T11:12:00.000Z	nsgn	Slart	http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_get.html
2009-07-13T11:13:00.000Z	Slart	nsgn	because when you click on the download cuda driver link you're redirected to the regular display driver.. or that's what it looks like
2009-07-13T11:14:00.000Z	nsgn	Slart	by god it looks like i am. why the f....
2009-07-13T11:14:00.000Z	nsgn		i guess i'll give that a shot. geez
2009-07-13T11:14:00.000Z	nsgn	Slart	so cuda is just built in all the drivers?
2009-07-13T11:16:00.000Z	Slart	nsgn	I would think so.. I have no idea when they started with CUDA though..might be a break off point at some time in history
2009-07-13T11:16:00.000Z	nsgn	Slart	argh, my next issue is that the drivers on that page are x86
2009-07-13T11:17:00.000Z	Slart	nsgn	you choose that on the same page.. linux 32bit or linux 64bit.. just above the actual link
2009-07-13T11:17:00.000Z	nsgn	Slart	from the driver archive? i'm not being offered choice
2009-07-13T11:18:00.000Z	Slart	nsgn	http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_get.html
2009-07-13T11:19:00.000Z	nsgn	Slart	ah, finally found a special 64 archive
