2005-03-10T08:32:00.000Z	Ziggity	thoreauputic	I tried but it can't find it ???
2005-03-10T08:33:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Ziggity	apt-cache search anjuta gives me about a dozen lines here
2005-03-10T08:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Ziggity	did you do apt-get update ?
2005-03-10T08:35:00.000Z	Ziggity	thoreauputic	yes I did the update
2005-03-10T08:35:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Ziggity	apt-cache policy says anjuta is in "universe" on warty - don't know for hoary but I would think it would be there
