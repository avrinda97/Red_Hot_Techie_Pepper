2007-06-12T10:03:00.000Z	DBlue		Why nvidia is so greedy?
2007-06-12T10:05:00.000Z	DBlue		Is the newest SUSE better then UBUNTU?
2007-06-12T10:05:00.000Z	DBlue		How can i get the temp. sensors?
2007-06-12T10:07:00.000Z	DBlue		Where to find a tool, like in SUSE to kill application?
2007-06-12T10:07:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	DBlue	alt + f2, xkill... click on the window you wish to kill
2007-06-12T10:08:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	DBlue	exactly... you can run "xkill" which turns your cursor into a death skull of doom to kill any window
2007-06-12T10:16:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	DBlue	they're probably already installed
2007-06-12T10:16:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	DBlue	i think you can mount by the term... only gnome-volume-manager isn't on in rescue if I recall
2007-06-12T10:17:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	DBlue	you install it?  system->admin->printing
2007-06-12T10:18:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	DBlue	and you can't print to it?
2007-06-12T10:18:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	DBlue	get any error messages?
2007-06-12T10:18:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	DBlue	what kind of printer?  does a test page work?
2007-06-12T10:21:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	DBlue	google for it. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=177098
2007-06-12T10:22:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	DBlue	go buy an HP :)
2007-06-12T10:23:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	DBlue	you said it was canon ip 1500
2007-06-12T10:23:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	DBlue	my point... hp makes great drivers that are included in ubuntu
2007-06-12T10:24:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	DBlue	you just said quick...
2007-06-12T10:27:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	DBlue	yes, please follow that link
2007-06-12T10:41:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	DBlue	depends on the filesystem type
2007-06-12T10:44:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	DBlue	well... it works, but be careful when browsing the filesystem as root
2007-06-12T10:45:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	DBlue	if ti's a fat32, it's different than ntfs which is different than ext3 in setting permissions... man mount
