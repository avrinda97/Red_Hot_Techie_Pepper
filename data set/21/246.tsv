2012-10-20T21:12:00.000Z	ajacom		that's my final goal
2012-10-20T21:12:00.000Z	ajacom		i prepared a fat32 partition to share my work between installs
2012-10-20T21:13:00.000Z	alexfpms	ajacom	i think grub doesn't support yet windows 8
2012-10-20T21:13:00.000Z	ajacom	alexfpms	i've seen some tutorials online on how to dual boot win8 with ubuntu. they don't have this issue, though :/
2012-10-20T21:18:00.000Z	alexfpms	ajacom	option to "Install along side Windows" does not work. Users need to create a boot partition, and install the GRUB bootloader to that partition.
2012-10-20T21:23:00.000Z	ajacom	alexfpms	so should i remove the partitions the installer did, and reinstall, but this time, create a boot partition manually ??
2012-10-20T21:25:00.000Z	alexfpms	ajacom	i have never tested grub with windows 8, but in that case is preferable to have a boot partition. so yes you can try
2012-10-20T21:25:00.000Z	ajacom	alexfpms	should the boot partition be in the free hdd space? (after sda3 in this case)
2012-10-20T21:27:00.000Z	alexfpms	ajacom	the boot partition should be primary but you already have 3 primaries
2012-10-20T21:29:00.000Z	alexfpms	ajacom	i'm wrong boot might be logical too
2012-10-20T21:32:00.000Z	alexfpms	ajacom	there is no 4
2012-10-20T21:32:00.000Z	alexfpms	ajacom	you choose create /boot, type logical that's all
2012-10-20T21:33:00.000Z	ajacom	alexfpms	ok
2012-10-20T21:33:00.000Z	alexfpms	ajacom	it will create extended if needed
2012-10-20T21:34:00.000Z	alexfpms	ajacom	ex2 ? you mean ext2 ?
2012-10-20T21:34:00.000Z	ajacom	alexfpms	yes, or ext4
2012-10-20T21:34:00.000Z	alexfpms	ajacom	why not ext4
2012-10-20T21:34:00.000Z	ajacom	alexfpms	yes, yes. i'm just confused on the names. i'll use ext4
2012-10-20T21:36:00.000Z	alexfpms	ajacom	your BIOS is UEFI enabled?
2012-10-20T21:37:00.000Z	ajacom	alexfpms	i'm not sure. yes the box says "Dual UEFI"
2012-10-20T21:39:00.000Z	alexfpms	ajacom	it's that "persistence" stuff? what do you mean ?
