2006-01-28T06:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	JarG0n	  fire up synaptic and isntall the libsdl stuff I guess. :P
2006-01-28T06:56:00.000Z	JarG0n	Dr_Willis	It's already installed, but there's a bug in it.  THese instructions tell me to install something as an alternative " Some Debian and Debian-based distributions ( like Ubuntu ) are crashing during startup. It appears this is caused by the SDL packages selection. You need to install libsdl1.2debian-alsa or libsdl1.2debian-oss instead of libsdl1.2debian-all. "
2006-01-28T06:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	JarG0n	 try apt-get install libsdl1.2debian-alsa
2006-01-28T06:58:00.000Z	JarG0n	Dr_Willis	E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily unavailable)
