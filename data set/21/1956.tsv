2010-03-13T17:10:00.000Z	andai		I heard something like windows can only boot from the first partition or if it's n cylinders from the start, but that's just boot right? I can put the partition itself anywhere?
2010-03-13T17:12:00.000Z	DasEi	andai	gparted can
2010-03-13T17:12:00.000Z	andai	DasEi	 but is that a good idea? Is the read/write support stable yet?
2010-03-13T17:13:00.000Z	DasEi	andai	if you want to use win and ubu easily both ways, I suggest run ext3 for ubu and ntfs for win
2010-03-13T17:13:00.000Z	andai	DasEi	Not Ext4?
2010-03-13T17:14:00.000Z	DasEi	andai	ext4 still can't be read properly from the ext-windows driver, ext3 can
2010-03-13T17:15:00.000Z	andai	DasEi	I'm mainly going to use it at school where I won;t have windows admin rights anyway (and afaik you need those to install drivers to read other filesystems [with everything i have tried])
2010-03-13T17:15:00.000Z	DasEi	andai	10 min are too long, maybe re-format it with new partition table
2010-03-13T17:15:00.000Z	andai	DasEi	What kind of partition table will be faster to read? Or do you mean my current one is weird and broken so anything will do? :P
2010-03-13T17:16:00.000Z	DasEi	andai	if gparted needs a 10 min to scan an external, sth is wrong there, either the  connection or it's partitioning
2010-03-13T17:17:00.000Z	DasEi	andai	but I see your problem then, if you can't install a fs-driver on the windows side
2010-03-13T17:18:00.000Z	DasEi	andai	though you'll lose some nice features, can install ubuntu to ntfs, too
2010-03-13T17:19:00.000Z	andai	DasEi	What cannot Ubuntu do if it runs on NTFS?
2010-03-13T17:19:00.000Z	andai	DasEi	And are you sure that's possible? I tried installing it to FAT32 the installer said i should select a more linuxy filesystem
2010-03-13T17:20:00.000Z	DasEi	andai	certain file permissions and the whole toolset it brings for extended, like fs-recovery, also you run in defragmentation more then ext3
2010-03-13T17:21:00.000Z	DasEi	andai	the sys itself needs a linux-fs, not the home-dir
2010-03-13T17:28:00.000Z	DasEi	andai	from your needs can install ubuntu itself in ext4, then use an extra /home , make that ntfs to be readable from windows, or just use an extra partition for windows-sharing
2010-03-13T17:28:00.000Z	andai	DasEi	Is Ext4 fast? Secure? :P
2010-03-13T17:28:00.000Z	DasEi	andai	yes
2010-03-13T17:29:00.000Z	andai	DasEi	Secure in the sense that if some ******* unplugs my drive it wont corrupt everything (like XFS did lol)
2010-03-13T17:29:00.000Z	DasEi	andai	fsck woks most of the time fine
