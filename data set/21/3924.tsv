2008-08-31T10:14:00.000Z	ubuntunub		how can i find out, without question, how large my Ubuntu partition/install size is?
2008-08-31T10:14:00.000Z	ubuntunub		i'm looking in System Monitor > File Systems > /dev/sda5 (~20GB)
2008-08-31T10:15:00.000Z	ubuntunub		Terminal = console?
2008-08-31T10:16:00.000Z	ubuntunub		strictly speaking, where is the console most directly accessed (not via the Terminal app)
2008-08-31T10:16:00.000Z	ubuntunub		?
2008-08-31T10:17:00.000Z	ubuntunub		dos ctrl-alt-f1 terminate my current desktop enviro?
2008-08-31T10:17:00.000Z	ubuntunub		does*
2008-08-31T10:17:00.000Z	ubuntunub		because i'm afraid to try it lol
2008-08-31T10:18:00.000Z	blitz	ubuntunub	no you use ctrl-alt-f7 to get back
2008-08-31T10:29:00.000Z	blitz	ubuntunub	pops up a window asking for your password, allowing you to run a program as the root user
2008-08-31T10:29:00.000Z	ubuntunub	blitz	but i thought that was "sudo"
2008-08-31T10:30:00.000Z	blitz	ubuntunub	sudo doesnt pop up a window, its for terminal and console
2008-08-31T10:31:00.000Z	blitz	ubuntunub	for instance you want to run a firewall or some application you may not have permissions to, you can't use "sudo" in the command text for the shortcut, but you can use gksudo
2008-08-31T10:48:00.000Z	blitz	ubuntunub	you can use and work with ntfs in linux
2008-08-31T10:48:00.000Z	ubuntunub	blitz	i heard NTFS support is flaky in linux and its best to use a FAT32 partition for transfers
2008-08-31T10:48:00.000Z	ubuntunub	blitz	or is it that Windows can't read/write Ext3?
2008-08-31T10:48:00.000Z	blitz	ubuntunub	infact a good example is being able to run World of Warcraft FROM an ntfs drive thru wine.. everything works
2008-08-31T10:50:00.000Z	blitz	ubuntunub	I haven't had a data loss problem with ntfs .. it works well
2008-08-31T10:53:00.000Z	blitz	ubuntunub	linux needs no defrag, just so you know :P
2008-08-31T10:54:00.000Z	ubuntunub	blitz	serious? why?
2008-08-31T11:00:00.000Z	blitz	ubuntunub	look into your system -> preferences -> sessions
