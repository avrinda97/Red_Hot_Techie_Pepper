2007-03-25T13:27:00.000Z	Jaymac		does anyone else have the latest linux kernel as: 2.6.20-13 but the latest linux restricted modules as 2.6.20-12 thus rendering restricted-modules uninstallable?
2007-03-25T13:28:00.000Z	Jaymac		(in feisty)
2007-03-25T13:30:00.000Z	Jaymac		can someone please tell me if there is a linux-restricted-modules-2.6.20-13-generic package anywhere???
2007-03-25T13:31:00.000Z	Jaymac		please?
2007-03-25T13:32:00.000Z	soundray	Jaymac	there is no -13- package yet
2007-03-25T13:32:00.000Z	Jaymac	soundray	- but i have a 2.6.20-13 kernel... and i can't install linux-restricted-modules-generic because it depends 2.6.20-13
2008-05-19T23:28:00.000Z	soundray	Jaymac	no rants please. Just 'echo a4 | sudo tee /etc/papersize'
2008-05-19T23:28:00.000Z	Jaymac	soundray	will that fix firefox?  every other application prints A4 fine
2008-05-19T23:28:00.000Z	soundray	Jaymac	ah, so your original information was misleading
2008-05-19T23:29:00.000Z	Jaymac	soundray	no it wasn't I said that it was a firefox issue
2008-05-19T23:29:00.000Z	soundray	Jaymac	which firefox version?
2008-05-19T23:30:00.000Z	soundray	Jaymac	if your /etc/papersize already contains a4, then that command obviously won't help
2008-05-19T23:30:00.000Z	Jaymac	soundray	yeah it is A4, I just checked
2008-05-19T23:31:00.000Z	soundray	Jaymac	firefox2 was ignoring system settings on papersize, but firefox 3 doesn't -- at least not here (just checked)
2008-05-19T23:31:00.000Z	Jaymac	soundray	it appears to change to A4, but as soon as I print, it goes back to US paper
2008-05-19T23:31:00.000Z	Jaymac	soundray	this is a fresh install of ubuntu 8.04...
2008-05-19T23:33:00.000Z	Jaymac	soundray	changed the value to paper, I'll print and see waht happens, thanks
2008-05-19T23:34:00.000Z	soundray	Jaymac	you changed it to paper? :)
2008-05-19T23:36:00.000Z	Jaymac	soundray	i changed value of paper, sorry
2008-05-19T23:41:00.000Z	Jaymac	soundray	that fixed it, thank you
2008-05-19T23:41:00.000Z	soundray	Jaymac	thank Jowi
