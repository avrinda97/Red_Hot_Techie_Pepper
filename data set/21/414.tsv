2012-10-02T22:10:00.000Z	ikonia		there must be something , a learning exercise, a benifit you think you may get
2012-10-02T22:10:00.000Z	Gallomimia	ikonia	everything you do is a learning experience. even reading this channel
2012-11-13T02:48:00.000Z	ikonia	Gallomimia	you've not installed it ?
2012-11-13T02:48:00.000Z	ikonia	Gallomimia	is sshd installed ?
2012-11-13T02:49:00.000Z	ikonia	Gallomimia	yeah it's crazy wild checking if you've installed a package before complaining it won't start
2012-11-13T02:56:00.000Z	ikonia	Gallomimia	can you show me the output of "uname -a" please
2012-11-13T02:58:00.000Z	ikonia	Gallomimia	did you log a call with them the other day
2012-11-13T02:59:00.000Z	ikonia	Gallomimia	you won't be able to upgrade
2012-11-13T02:59:00.000Z	ikonia	Gallomimia	didn't we go through this a day or two ago ?
2012-11-13T03:00:00.000Z	ikonia	Gallomimia	are you on a mac ssh'ing into ubuntu ?
2012-11-13T03:01:00.000Z	ikonia	Gallomimia	didn't I tell you to log a call with your hosting provider ?
2012-11-13T03:05:00.000Z	ikonia	Gallomimia	where you the user adaminsull
2012-11-13T03:05:00.000Z	ikonia	Gallomimia	ok, different person
2012-11-13T03:06:00.000Z	ikonia	Gallomimia	basically a user had a similar problem, same bastardised version of ubuntu on a bad virtualizaion platform
2012-11-13T03:06:00.000Z	ikonia	Gallomimia	the only way you can do anything is log a call and ask you hosting provider to change things, but the bottom line is, the el5 kernel is too old too
2012-11-13T03:06:00.000Z	ikonia	Gallomimia	too much is provided from the hypervisor host, not enough from the guest
2012-11-13T03:07:00.000Z	ikonia	Gallomimia	it's the price of having a terrible hosting provider
2012-11-13T03:08:00.000Z	ikonia	Gallomimia	thats fine, cheap is not a problem if you are happy with the limitations
2012-11-13T03:09:00.000Z	ikonia	Gallomimia	you may want to ask them to do a reset back to default though
2012-11-13T03:10:00.000Z	ikonia	Gallomimia	not massivly
