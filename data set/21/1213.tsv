2010-12-24T07:45:00.000Z	zefixn		ubuntu allows creating a raid level 10 by when selecting 2 devices - does that work - and do i really have the advantages of raid 10?
2010-12-24T07:46:00.000Z	Rigorm0rtis	zefixn	Short answer: no.
2010-12-24T07:46:00.000Z	zefixn	Rigorm0rtis	why not - i would agree with 0+1 but...
2010-12-24T07:47:00.000Z	Rigorm0rtis	zefixn	with just two devices you're either getting just raid 1 i believe. so while you get redundancy, you don't get the speed of raid 0.
2010-12-24T07:48:00.000Z	zefixn	Rigorm0rtis	what would be if you would split up your 2 disks into 4 partitions disk 1/1 disk 1/2.... and mirror disk 1/1 with disk 2/1 and then create a stripe set over these two raid 1s?
2010-12-24T07:50:00.000Z	Rigorm0rtis	zefixn	no, because the point of raid0 is using several _devices'_ speed. If you used partitions, the constant seeking required would drastically reduce the array's performance.
2010-12-24T07:51:00.000Z	zefixn	Rigorm0rtis	doesn't sound very logical to me
2010-12-24T07:51:00.000Z	Rigorm0rtis	zefixn	how so?
2010-12-24T07:52:00.000Z	zefixn	Rigorm0rtis	i get extra performance if i use a stripe set over two tiny partitions on more than 1 disk
2010-12-24T07:52:00.000Z	zefixn	Rigorm0rtis	not only when using entire disks
2010-12-24T07:57:00.000Z	Rigorm0rtis	zefixn	i might be misunderstanding what you're trying to do. From my take you're trying to create a raid0 on a single disk with two partitions, do this to another disk, and then combine these two disks into a raid1 array in order to create a raid10 array. Am I right?
2010-12-24T07:59:00.000Z	zefixn	Rigorm0rtis	i dont want do invent something new - i just want to understand what ubuntu is doing and if it would work and if how....
2010-12-24T08:01:00.000Z	Rigorm0rtis	zefixn	if you select a raid10 array for two devices, you get the equivalent of a raid 1 array because there are not enough devices for a raid 1+0 array.
2010-12-24T08:01:00.000Z	zefixn	Rigorm0rtis	i thought it could work like createing sda1, sda2, sdb1, sdb2 - create raid 1 over sda1 and sdb1 getting md0 - create raid 1 over sda2 and sdb2 getting md1 - create raid 0 over md0 and md1
2010-12-24T08:02:00.000Z	Rigorm0rtis	zefixn	no, because RAIDs are based on devices and are not typically concerned with partitions.
2010-12-24T08:02:00.000Z	zefixn	Rigorm0rtis	not true
2010-12-24T08:03:00.000Z	zefixn	Rigorm0rtis	do you speak about physical devices?
2010-12-24T08:03:00.000Z	zefixn	Rigorm0rtis	if not partitions are represented in form of a device in unix systems
2010-12-24T08:04:00.000Z	zefixn	Rigorm0rtis	i never said i want to stripe partitions on same device
2010-12-24T08:06:00.000Z	Rigorm0rtis	zefixn	sorry for misunderstanding you then.
2010-12-24T08:06:00.000Z	zefixn	Rigorm0rtis	i'm sorry
