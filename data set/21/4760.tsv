2008-02-26T21:48:00.000Z	mad_max02		is there any partitioning tool that can make ext3 partition on ntfs formatted disk ?? I dont want to use whole disk so thats a bit tricy
2008-02-26T21:48:00.000Z	mad_max02		*tricky
2008-02-26T21:49:00.000Z	soundray	mad_max02	when you install Ubuntu, it will automatically resize your ntfs partition and set up an ext3 one.
2008-05-19T23:01:00.000Z	soundray	mad_max02	it's the sensible choice, given that most graphics hardware won't display more, even in 32bit mod
2008-05-19T23:03:00.000Z	mad_max02	soundray	I have a problem switching workspaces when playing warcraft in wine and in the output it says something about color depth
2008-05-19T23:03:00.000Z	mad_max02	soundray	and aint 32bit display mode normal from long time ago ?
2008-05-19T23:03:00.000Z	soundray	mad_max02	no
2008-05-19T23:04:00.000Z	soundray	mad_max02	32bit has always been more of a pseudo-mode that resulted in 24bit displays anyway
2008-05-19T23:04:00.000Z	mad_max02	soundray	ok. then something else must be a problem
2008-05-19T23:05:00.000Z	soundray	mad_max02	if you have graphics-switching related problems, I would try switching down to 16 rather than up to 32
2008-05-19T23:05:00.000Z	mad_max02	soundray	yeah but game works in 32bit. maybe I'll try 16 just for a change
2008-05-19T23:06:00.000Z	soundray	mad_max02	by all means, try it all out. Just add a line    DefaultDepth 32   in /etc/X11/xorg.conf , section Screen
2008-05-19T23:07:00.000Z	mad_max02	soundray	do you wanna check out my console output ?? I have it on pastebin   http://www.pastebin.org/37078
2008-05-19T23:08:00.000Z	soundray	mad_max02	doesn't mean much to me, sorry. Can't see anything colordepth-related, either
2008-05-19T23:08:00.000Z	mad_max02	soundray	well people at winehq channel arent much of a hep
2008-05-22T18:21:00.000Z	soundray	mad_max02	'sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop'
2008-05-22T18:21:00.000Z	soundray	mad_max02	then choose a KDE session from the login window
2008-07-01T20:22:00.000Z	soundray	mad_max02	are you on hardy?
2008-07-01T20:23:00.000Z	mad_max02	soundray	yep
2008-07-01T20:24:00.000Z	soundray	mad_max02	run 'apt-cache policy firefox-3.0' to find out your  current version (marked ***). If it's still beta, do a 'sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade'
2008-07-01T20:25:00.000Z	mad_max02	soundray	thanks. I'm on it
