2011-12-16T23:55:00.000Z	auronandace	BluesKaj	i see, is there a ubuntu documentation team you could notify (or a bug report to submit)?
2011-12-16T23:57:00.000Z	BluesKaj	auronandace	well, the problem is that the STA driver could work on some legacy setups , so it's becoming an exception to the rule that works on some system
