2007-03-18T10:49:00.000Z	amar		can anyone help me to mount windows partition
2007-03-18T10:50:00.000Z	montyp	amar	what sort of partition? NTFS or FAT?
2007-03-18T10:50:00.000Z	amar		both FAT n NTFS......
2007-03-18T10:50:00.000Z	amar		montyp:i'm experiencing some weird problem
2007-03-18T10:50:00.000Z	montyp	amar	for the NTFS install ntfs-config
2007-03-18T10:51:00.000Z	montyp	amar	which will give you ntfs-3g, as suggested
2007-03-18T10:51:00.000Z	amar	montyp	i used the commands given in official ubuntu guide to mount FAT partition........ but same drive will be mounted repeatedly
2007-03-18T10:52:00.000Z	amar	montyp	i mean all drives contain the same folders...... even though i mount different drives
2007-03-18T10:52:00.000Z	montyp	amar	are you mounting these different drives on different mount points?
2007-03-18T10:53:00.000Z	amar		no....... i'm using /media/windows to all the drives
2007-03-18T10:53:00.000Z	amar		montyp:no....... i'm using /media/windows to all the drives
2007-03-18T10:53:00.000Z	montyp	amar	you have to mount each partition on a different mount point
2007-03-18T10:54:00.000Z	amar	montyp	but in dat documentation they have mounted all the drives in same point
2007-03-18T10:54:00.000Z	montyp	amar	well, if that is actually what the doc says, it is wrong. You would just keep mounting over the previous mount
2007-03-18T10:55:00.000Z	amar	montyp	thank u very much, i will try with different mounting points
2007-03-18T10:55:00.000Z	montyp	amar	so make mount points for each of the partitions (use "sudo fdisk -l" if you need to see them), then mount them ("sudo mount -t vfat /dev/hda1 /mnt/windows" for example)
2007-03-18T10:56:00.000Z	montyp	amar	cool, you may have better luck :)
2007-03-18T10:57:00.000Z	amar	montyp	so to mount another drive shld i use mounting point as /mnt/windows2
2007-03-18T10:57:00.000Z	montyp	amar	yeah
2007-03-18T10:57:00.000Z	amar	montyp	thanx :-)
2007-03-18T10:58:00.000Z	montyp	amar	and remember if you want to read/write to NTFS partitions to do "sudo apt-get install ntfs-config" , then when it's installed "gksu ntfs-config"
