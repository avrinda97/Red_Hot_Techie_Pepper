2009-05-25T20:37:00.000Z	Zzeiss	dewente	take a look in your /var/log/messages.  Specifically, unplug the pen drive, type "tail -f /var/log/messages", plug pen drive in, wait a minute, and tell us what it said.
2009-05-25T20:39:00.000Z	dewente	Zzeiss	 Attached SCSI removable disk
2009-05-25T20:39:00.000Z	Zzeiss	dewente	And then?  Does it say anything further?  Like "sdb1 sdb2 sdb3"
2009-05-25T20:40:00.000Z	dewente	Zzeiss	new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 13
2009-05-25T20:41:00.000Z	Zzeiss	dewente	And nothing past that "address 13" thing?  Is the pen drive formatted?  or did it maybe get wiped?
2009-05-25T20:42:00.000Z	Zzeiss	dewente	Anything more come back?

2009-05-25T20:45:00.000Z	Zzeiss	dewente	OK... and nothing more?
2009-05-25T20:46:00.000Z	dewente	Zzeiss	   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System  that's it
2009-05-25T20:46:00.000Z	dewente	Zzeiss	any details
2009-05-25T20:47:00.000Z	Zzeiss	dewente	does it list anything after the Device Boot line?
2009-05-25T20:48:00.000Z	dewente	Zzeiss	last time I used  was copy some files running ubuntu live, taking some file before format the pc
2009-05-25T20:49:00.000Z	Zzeiss	dewente	Well, it's not got any partitions on the pen drive now.  Something clobbered it.  Did you by any chance copy to /dev/sdb, not /dev/sdb1?
2009-05-25T20:49:00.000Z	dewente	Zzeiss	 I did not
2009-05-25T20:50:00.000Z	Zzeiss	dewente	Well, is there anything on the pen drive you need?  Or can we wipe it?
2009-05-25T20:51:00.000Z	Zzeiss	dewente	Well, I don't know how to get that file off... as the partition table seems corrupted.  if you can copy it off on another system, I'd do that first.
2009-05-25T20:54:00.000Z	dewente	Zzeiss	how to wipe it?
2009-05-25T20:54:00.000Z	Zzeiss	dewente	you wipe it with fdisk or gparted.  But it will delete _all_ of the data that was once there.
