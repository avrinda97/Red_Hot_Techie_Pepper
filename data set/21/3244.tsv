2009-02-17T15:41:00.000Z	Manas		how
2009-02-17T15:41:00.000Z	shinoj	Manas	you have to compile it

2009-02-17T15:43:00.000Z	Manas		so what i do, shinoj?
2009-02-17T15:43:00.000Z	shinoj	Manas	it must be the problem with volume controller
2009-02-17T15:43:00.000Z	shinoj	Manas	just try to adjust the volume
2009-02-17T15:43:00.000Z	Manas	shinoj	i have vista, and works fine there
2009-02-17T15:44:00.000Z	shinoj	Manas	and try to lower the volume, or maximze the volume, there is fine tune between somewhere
