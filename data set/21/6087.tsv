2008-01-01T02:19:00.000Z	Voyage_		?
2008-01-01T02:21:00.000Z	astro76	Voyage_	nope, if they are in the admin group
2008-01-01T02:22:00.000Z	astro76	Voyage_	root password has nothing to do with sudo
2008-01-01T02:25:00.000Z	Voyage_	astro76	when i sudo. that makes me root? dont i have to give the roots pwd in sudo command ?
2008-01-01T02:26:00.000Z	astro76	Voyage_	no the whole point of sudo is that it uses the user's pasword
2008-01-01T02:26:00.000Z	astro76	Voyage_	by default in Ubuntu there is not root password making direct root logins disabled
2008-01-01T02:27:00.000Z	Voyage_	astro76	 you mean theres no root pwd ?
2008-01-01T02:27:00.000Z	astro76	Voyage_	correct
2008-01-01T02:27:00.000Z	Voyage_	astro76	then what is root
2008-01-01T02:28:00.000Z	astro76	Voyage_	did you read the RootSudo page? root is root, by default in Ubuntu you can only use sudo to get root privileges, not su
2008-01-01T02:28:00.000Z	Voyage_	astro76	root login can be made too. you just have to edit some confg files.
2008-01-01T02:29:00.000Z	astro76	Voyage_	I said by default in Ubuntu!
2008-01-01T02:29:00.000Z	astro76	Voyage_	you just have to set a password, but there is no reason and it's not recommended
2008-01-01T02:29:00.000Z	Voyage_	astro76	so iam privileged equal to root. and if i make  a new user. he can be unprivilged in some cases ?
2008-01-01T02:30:00.000Z	astro76	Voyage_	new users are by default *not* in the admin group
2008-01-01T02:31:00.000Z	Voyage_	astro76	iam the first user. am i in the admin group?
2008-01-01T02:31:00.000Z	astro76	Voyage_	yes
2008-01-01T02:32:00.000Z	astro76	Voyage_	admin ;)
2008-01-01T02:32:00.000Z	Voyage_	astro76	ic.
2008-01-01T02:34:00.000Z	Voyage_	astro76	emmajane scguy318 i want to make my partitions only be writable/deletable to root. (by sudo as you say) otherwise to all other users it should be readonly. how can i do it?
2008-01-01T02:34:00.000Z	astro76	Voyage_	if you make a partition by default that will be the case unless you change permissions
