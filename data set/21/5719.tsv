2007-10-09T05:18:00.000Z	decay		When i boot up the ubuntu cd,and select "install ubuntu", some white text goes through the screen then the screen goes black right after it says "Loading Gnome Display Manager"...and it stays black. geforge go 6100. any ideads?
2007-10-09T05:19:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	decay	get the alternate install CD
2007-10-09T05:19:00.000Z	decay	Davy_Jones	what is that?
2007-10-09T05:19:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	decay	i got a geforce 6600 gt, and i couldn't install it with the normal cd
2007-10-09T05:19:00.000Z	Davy_Jones		!alternate | decay
2007-10-09T05:20:00.000Z	decay	Davy_Jones	i used to have the 6600gt, and it gave me no probs. now i got a laptop, and can't install =[
2007-10-09T05:20:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	decay	i get the alternate install cd by default, cuz the live cd never worked on any of my gfx cards
2007-10-09T05:21:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	decay	imo, ubuntu live cd doesn't have good hardware support
2007-10-09T05:21:00.000Z	decay	Davy_Jones	so you installed from the alternative cd...but then, does it boot up for the first time with a GUi?
2007-10-09T05:21:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	decay	exactly
2007-10-09T05:22:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	decay	once you have ubuntu installed.. you can always change the driver in /etc/X11/xorg.conf to "vesa".. start up the GUI then fix things from there
2007-10-09T05:23:00.000Z	decay	Davy_Jones	gotcha. but im a bit skeptical about doing the partition thing with text only
2007-10-09T05:23:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	decay	but with the live cd, you have much less options
2007-10-09T05:23:00.000Z	decay		never done it befor
2007-10-09T05:23:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	decay	it isn't that hard really.. i've read nothing about it and i was able to partition safely.. you just have to be extra careful
2007-10-09T05:24:00.000Z	decay		alright Davy_Jones ,ill try. ill report back in a bit
2007-10-09T05:24:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	decay	if you really don't wanna do it, get a live cd with good hardware support. like Knoppix.. partition the thing, and reboot to ubuntu install cd
2007-10-09T05:24:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	decay	good luch
2007-10-09T05:24:00.000Z	Davy_Jones		luck
2007-10-09T05:25:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	decay	i'll be out for a bit, tell me how it goes and i'll check it out later
2007-10-09T05:25:00.000Z	decay	Davy_Jones	alright. thank you
