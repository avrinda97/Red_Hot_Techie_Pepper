2007-08-08T05:40:00.000Z	foug		can someone tell me how to install a .deb file through terminal real quick please?
2007-08-08T05:40:00.000Z	lockd	foug	sudo dpkg -i filename.deb
2007-08-08T05:40:00.000Z	foug	lockd	k thanks, what's dpkg mean and is there a site what shoes all the letters mean? like, in loop -o and mount -t, dkpg -i
2007-08-08T05:41:00.000Z	lockd	foug	i dunno, but kde has the man:/ kioslave
2007-08-08T05:41:00.000Z	lockd	foug	meaning you can just go to man:/dpkg in konqueror
2007-08-08T05:42:00.000Z	foug	lockd	ah i see
2007-08-08T05:42:00.000Z	lockd	foug	you can use man itself, but I prefer the pretty version
2007-08-08T05:42:00.000Z	lockd	foug	yes, there are 2 great ones
2007-08-08T05:42:00.000Z	lockd	foug	tintin++ or tinyfugue
2007-08-08T05:43:00.000Z	foug	lockd	it seems i need python2.2
2007-08-08T05:45:00.000Z	lockd	foug	oh, so no need for something besides MCL?
2007-08-08T05:45:00.000Z	foug	lockd	well, neither of them will install unless i have python 2.2. I'm trying to play Medievia
2007-08-08T05:47:00.000Z	lockd	foug	tintin++ has no need for python, I'm fairly sure
2007-08-08T05:47:00.000Z	lockd	foug	i mean, last I checked it was written in plain C
2007-08-08T05:48:00.000Z	foug	lockd	you are right
2007-08-08T05:49:00.000Z	foug	lockd	hmm, silly question, where did tintin++ install to? the command itself doesn't launch it
2007-08-08T05:50:00.000Z	lockd	foug	tt++
2007-08-08T05:50:00.000Z	lockd	foug	that's the reason we have command-not-found or whatever, some commands are not the same as package names
2007-08-08T05:51:00.000Z	foug	lockd	"make sure you have universe" componten enabled
2007-08-08T05:51:00.000Z	lockd	foug	so tt++ does not run even though you did install of tintin++?
2007-08-08T05:51:00.000Z	foug	lockd	yup ;\
