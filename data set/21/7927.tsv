2006-09-19T16:20:00.000Z	SpudDogg	Jack_Sparrow	Do you know how to make Firefox stream videos from utube, etc?
2006-09-20T15:31:00.000Z	SpudDogg	Jack_Sparrow	 You usually seem to know the answers.  Have you ever played with kismet?
2006-09-20T15:31:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SpudDogg	No sorry never used kismet
2006-09-20T15:31:00.000Z	SpudDogg	Jack_Sparrow	 ok, thought id ask :)  thanks anyway
2006-09-29T08:00:00.000Z	SpudDogg	Jack_Sparrow	you here?
2007-10-03T06:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SpudDogg	the few times I have tried mixing ide and sata drives in the same box.. it became rather sluggish like the system was slowed down by adding the ide
2007-10-03T06:21:00.000Z	SpudDogg	Jack_Sparrow	yea, this is only temporary...I dont use windoes
2008-02-28T23:30:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SpudDogg	You wont gain much by doing so and could cause yourself some headaches.. BUt for educational purposes.. then sure..
2008-02-28T23:32:00.000Z	SpudDogg	Jack_Sparrow	 I'm not too interested in recompiling the kernel for educational purposes, but LFS and distros like gentoo do have a nice edge when it comes to "bloatware" being installed.  I'm just looking for max performance from this computer
2008-02-28T23:33:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SpudDogg	Like I said, I dont think you will gain much.  BEtter off adding a bit of ram than recompiling the kernel
2008-02-28T23:34:00.000Z	SpudDogg	Jack_Sparrow	 Yea, I'm not going to play with it today, but maybe eventually.  By the way, do you know how Ubuntu handles flash plugins for 64-bit?  nswrapper?
2008-02-28T23:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SpudDogg	Yes, and I agree that is not a good solution
2008-03-30T22:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SpudDogg	Please dont do that.
2008-03-30T22:43:00.000Z	SpudDogg	Jack_Sparrow	 don't do what?  Ask a question?
2008-03-30T22:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SpudDogg	post a link with no explanation especially one hat long
2008-03-30T22:43:00.000Z	SpudDogg	Jack_Sparrow	 ok, sorry
2008-06-05T00:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SpudDogg	Only because I just take the easy questions
2008-06-05T00:24:00.000Z	SpudDogg	Jack_Sparrow	 you probably dont remember (and i cant remember specifics either) but you've helped me greatly over the years...thanks again :)
2008-06-05T00:24:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SpudDogg	Glad to have helped
