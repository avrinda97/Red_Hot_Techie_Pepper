2008-03-26T06:01:00.000Z	lusius		can someone please help me with a wine problem?
2008-03-26T06:02:00.000Z	lusius		im trying to run san andreas as root user with wine, but it gets some kind of segfault, works fine as normal user, but not as root.... what can the problem be?
2008-03-26T06:03:00.000Z	Stroganoff	lusius	why play it as root?
2008-03-26T06:03:00.000Z	Stroganoff	lusius	set the correct folder permission so you dont have to use root for savegames and what not
2008-03-26T06:04:00.000Z	lusius	Stroganoff	my winecfg just returns a blank fucked up windows when calling it, root however works fine
2008-03-26T06:04:00.000Z	lusius	Stroganoff	its a native install of san andreas from a windows machine, all the files are chowned to current user
2008-03-26T06:05:00.000Z	Stroganoff	lusius	have you installed wine with the ubuntu repos?
2008-03-26T06:05:00.000Z	lusius	Stroganoff	yep
2008-03-26T06:06:00.000Z	lusius	Stroganoff	odd?
2008-03-26T06:09:00.000Z	lusius	Stroganoff	when i run my samp.exe file i get a "err:x11drv:X11DRV_CreateWindow invalid window width -248" and a big blank window
2008-03-26T06:11:00.000Z	Stroganoff	lusius	is your ~/.wine folder chown'd correctly? (maybe you ran winecfg as root the first time)
2008-03-26T06:12:00.000Z	lusius	Stroganoff	hmm, i could try to chown all
2008-03-26T06:12:00.000Z	lusius	Stroganoff	isn't is just "chown lusius /home/lusius/.wine
2008-03-26T06:13:00.000Z	Stroganoff	lusius	chown -r ...
2008-03-26T06:13:00.000Z	lusius	Stroganoff	 xD embarrasing xD
2008-03-26T06:16:00.000Z	lusius	Stroganoff	nope, same prob
2008-03-26T06:16:00.000Z	lusius	Stroganoff	-.-
2008-03-26T06:16:00.000Z	Stroganoff	lusius	what are the errors in console when you run winecfg as user?
2008-03-26T06:18:00.000Z	lusius	Stroganoff	none, just a abscure window popping up, but when i run samp.exe i get the "err:x11drv:X11DRV_CreateWindow invalid window width -248" and the window looks the same
2008-03-26T06:19:00.000Z	Stroganoff	lusius	i got no idea. you could try sudo apt-get purge wine and so forth or ask in #wine
2008-03-26T06:20:00.000Z	lusius	Stroganoff	oki, tnx for your help anyway ^^
