2011-04-16T02:22:00.000Z	YankDownUnder		Oy...ZModem protocol was really really great "back in the day" and I beta-tested it heaps of times on my BBS....
2011-04-16T02:22:00.000Z	cykros	YankDownUnder	do you still run a BBS?
2011-04-16T02:23:00.000Z	cykros		I mostly connect to entropybbs.co.nz these days
2011-04-16T02:23:00.000Z	cykros		just moved away from vertrauen recently
2011-04-16T02:23:00.000Z	cykros		though, i managed to screw things up with BRE, so i can't play that there until (unless?) the door gets reset.
2011-04-16T02:23:00.000Z	cykros		preferred applications
2011-04-16T02:24:00.000Z	cykros		@ senix
2011-04-16T02:24:00.000Z	cykros		that would depend on your user interface
2011-04-16T02:24:00.000Z	cykros		but it'd be somewhere in a system menu of some kind
2011-04-16T02:24:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	cykros	Actually - been thinking about setting one up again - JUST LIKE the old days...
2011-04-16T02:24:00.000Z	cykros		if its gnome, i think system -> <something> -> preferred applications
2011-04-16T02:25:00.000Z	cykros	YankDownUnder	check out the enthral or synchronet packages
2011-04-16T02:25:00.000Z	cykros		both are pretty handy suites that are fairly easy to config the hell out of
2011-04-16T02:25:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	cykros	Been there done that - working on the new incarnation of VBBS
2011-04-16T02:25:00.000Z	cykros		ahh
2011-04-16T02:25:00.000Z	cykros		cool
2011-04-16T02:25:00.000Z	cykros		nice to see more systems around
2011-04-16T02:25:00.000Z	cykros		i'm waiting to see what people come up with on the new commodore computers from commodore USA
2011-04-16T02:25:00.000Z	cykros		especially once the Commodore OS starts shipping out
2011-04-16T02:26:00.000Z	cykros		for now they're just shipping with ubuntu
2011-04-16T02:26:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	cykros	We'll find out very soon...very soon.... :)
