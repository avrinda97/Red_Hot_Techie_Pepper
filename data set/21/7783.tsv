2006-10-14T07:11:00.000Z	cpk2	jmspeex	did you try adding in the resolutions into the mode section?
2006-10-14T07:11:00.000Z	cpk2	jmspeex	in you xorg.conf
2006-10-14T07:13:00.000Z	jmspeex	cpk2	the xorg.conf file contains *only* the 1920x1200 resolution, nothing else.
2006-10-14T07:14:00.000Z	cpk2	jmspeex	and you set the right horz sync and vert refresh in xorg?
2006-10-14T07:14:00.000Z	jmspeex	cpk2	oh, the log file also says "not using mode "1920x1200" (no mode of this name)"
2006-10-14T07:14:00.000Z	cpk2	jmspeex	you can do sudo ddcprobe to see what your system believes the monitor can do
2006-10-14T07:15:00.000Z	jmspeex	cpk2	isn't hsync supposed to be auto-detected (how am I supposed to know these values)?
2006-10-14T07:15:00.000Z	cpk2	jmspeex	if you are lucky ddcprobe can detect the values, otherwise you will need a manual or somesuch
2006-10-14T07:16:00.000Z	jmspeex	cpk2	ddcprobe doesn't even have the 1600x1200, which xorg is currently using!
2006-10-14T07:16:00.000Z	cpk2	jmspeex	would you mind pastebinning your xorg.conf?
2006-10-14T07:17:00.000Z	jmspeex	cpk2	url?
2006-10-14T07:17:00.000Z	cpk2		!pstebi
2006-10-14T07:17:00.000Z	cpk2		!pastebin
2006-10-14T07:19:00.000Z	jmspeex	cpk2	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/26734
2006-10-14T07:21:00.000Z	cpk2	jmspeex	/etc/X11/xorg.conf =P not the log hehe
2006-10-14T07:21:00.000Z	jmspeex	cpk2	oops, sorry :-)
2006-10-14T07:22:00.000Z	jmspeex	cpk2	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/26735
2006-10-14T07:24:00.000Z	cpk2	jmspeex	it does seem like your horz sync and vert refresh are a little low, do you know your monitor model?
2006-10-14T07:25:00.000Z	jmspeex	cpk2	It's a laptop LCD, so hsync is a bit meaningless, isn't it?
2006-10-14T07:25:00.000Z	jmspeex		Dell D820 to be more precise.
2006-10-14T07:28:00.000Z	cpk2	jmspeex	hrmm yeah, wonder how different lcd is from crt
