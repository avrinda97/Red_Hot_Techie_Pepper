2006-11-04T11:04:00.000Z	theplatypus		Thinking about uninstalling both nvidia and nvidia-glx to see what happens
2006-11-04T11:04:00.000Z	theplatypus		can't believe there isn't a history in update-manager
2006-11-04T11:05:00.000Z	theplatypus		Found someone else with the same problem
2006-11-04T11:07:00.000Z	theplatypus		rootil: does the nvidia kernel revision number match the nvidiaglx revision number
2006-11-04T11:07:00.000Z	rooti1	theplatypus	gonna have a look
2006-11-04T11:11:00.000Z	rooti1	theplatypus	dunno i dont think that the versions are matching: 20051028 is the kernel and 2.6.17.6-1 is the glx
2006-11-04T11:11:00.000Z	rooti1		but there are no updates
2006-11-04T11:12:00.000Z	theplatypus	rooti1	: try running glxgears
2006-11-04T11:12:00.000Z	rooti1		glxgears ? sry i am very new to ubunto where do i find this ?
2006-11-04T11:12:00.000Z	theplatypus		just type it into  a terminal
2006-11-04T11:12:00.000Z	rooti1		uh yeah i see a result
2006-11-04T11:13:00.000Z	theplatypus		is it an error
2006-11-04T11:13:00.000Z	theplatypus		?
2006-11-04T11:13:00.000Z	rooti1		no that are the gears :D
2006-11-04T11:13:00.000Z	rooti1		but they are running deathly slow
2006-11-04T11:16:00.000Z	rooti1	theplatypus	if i see the gears. what does it mean ? does it mean the drivers do work? but why are them that slow
2006-11-04T11:16:00.000Z	theplatypus		rootil: it means you are not having the same problem that I am. lol
2006-11-04T11:17:00.000Z	rooti1	theplatypus	hehe thats funny, but the drivers still are not working lol
2006-11-04T11:17:00.000Z	theplatypus		rootil: have you edited the xorg file
2006-11-04T11:18:00.000Z	rooti1	theplatypus	i dindt edit a thing, the only steps i did is installing nvidia-glx and nvidia-glx-config enable and got an error
2006-11-04T11:19:00.000Z	rooti1	theplatypus	should i do it ?
