2008-02-06T10:07:00.000Z	lanzelloth	Zamboli	what kind of wireless card is it?
2008-02-06T10:10:00.000Z	Zamboli	lanzelloth	i don't think its my card because iwconfig gives me the correct MAC address and SSID of my router
2008-02-06T10:11:00.000Z	lanzelloth	Zamboli	hmm, i'm not sure how to detect the card
2008-02-06T10:11:00.000Z	lanzelloth	Zamboli	no IP is that even possible?
2008-02-06T10:12:00.000Z	lanzelloth	Zamboli	have you looked at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessCardsSupported yet?
2008-02-06T10:14:00.000Z	Zamboli	lanzelloth	i don't think its a card support issue. i can see my router :\
2008-02-06T10:25:00.000Z	lanzelloth	Zamboli	hm, so what's the problem then?
2008-02-06T10:17:00.000Z	lanzelloth	Zamboli	like, you can go to 192.168.0.1 ?
2008-02-06T10:18:00.000Z	Zamboli	lanzelloth	i can not
2008-02-06T10:19:00.000Z	lanzelloth	Zamboli	when you click on the network manager applet thing do you see an option for wireless network?
2008-02-06T10:19:00.000Z	lanzelloth	Zamboli	do you see any network under there?
2008-02-06T10:20:00.000Z	Zamboli	lanzelloth	my network will show up, but im connected under the manager
2008-02-06T10:23:00.000Z	lanzelloth	Zamboli	what manager?
2008-02-06T10:24:00.000Z	Zamboli	lanzelloth	my network will show up, and accepts the WPA key
2008-02-06T10:26:00.000Z	Zamboli	lanzelloth	nothing will come up in the browser
2008-02-06T10:27:00.000Z	lanzelloth	Zamboli	i'm sorry, if that's the case i don't think i can help you with that, i thought you were trying to setup the wireless card like i did a couple days ago
2008-02-06T10:28:00.000Z	Zamboli	lanzelloth	thanks for trying
2008-02-06T10:28:00.000Z	lanzelloth	Zamboli	checked the forums yet?
2008-02-06T10:28:00.000Z	lanzelloth	Zamboli	imo it's better for posting specific problems
