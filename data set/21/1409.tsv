2011-04-24T20:22:00.000Z	nbubuntu		hi , using 10.10 I had install an application , when I start it prompt for password and i displaying some file will be modified .I am not sure whether it's safe to let it modified ? any help guys ? Here's the pastebin http://pastebin.com/JvkJ0Y3u  Thank you :)
2011-04-24T20:24:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	nbubuntu	more like the application might require root access because of the files it is trying to modify may belong to root rather than the fact that you can run the app as user I think
2011-04-24T20:25:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	nbubuntu	then again, I'd check to see of /tmp/fuse belongs to root or not. I certainly do not have that directory so I cannot confirm it
2011-04-24T20:33:00.000Z	nbubuntu	psycho_oreos	: check on temp/fuse and it's empty on the fuse folder
2011-04-24T20:34:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	nbubuntu	you meant /tmp, but what about the permissions on /tmp/fuse?
2011-04-24T20:34:00.000Z	nbubuntu	psycho_oreos	:  without typing the password the application still launch
2011-04-24T20:35:00.000Z	nbubuntu	psycho_oreos	:  /tmp/fuse folder is empty
2011-04-24T20:36:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	nbubuntu	I'm not saying if its empty or not, or does the directory exist? If it does, check to see who owns that directory or just tell me that there's no such directory :)
2011-04-24T20:38:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	nbubuntu	If the directory /tmp/fuse doesn't exist in the first place you would have gotten this message: ls: cannot access /tmp/fuse: No such file or directory
2011-04-24T20:40:00.000Z	nbubuntu	psycho_oreos	:  there a directory exist , drwxr-xr-x
2011-04-24T20:41:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	nbubuntu	yes so that directory exist, now see who owns that directory, it will tell you in the next two columns, first column from that output would be the UID and then it would be followed by GID
2011-04-24T20:41:00.000Z	nbubuntu	psycho_oreos	:  there is also an application .domain at the /tmp/ srwxr-xr-x
2011-04-24T20:42:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	nbubuntu	ok, pastebin (not paste) the output of the command: ls -al /tmp
2011-04-24T20:44:00.000Z	nbubuntu	psycho_oreos	:  http://pastebin.com/0WYTgV6g
2011-04-24T20:46:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	nbubuntu	seems like /tmp/fuse is owned by you, yet I don't see why the application would say that it would be modifying critical parts of the system.. Again I'm still presuming the parent directory belongs to root, hence that warning. I'm presuming it should be safe to ignore the warning
2011-04-24T20:48:00.000Z	nbubuntu	psycho_oreos	:  oh , thanks , feeling weird it required a password prompt when running the application . Just wanted to make sure whether it's safe .Seems like it's safe , even I didn't input the password , the application still launch and run .
2011-04-24T20:49:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	nbubuntu	yeah the program will still run, the program will simply be denied access to modifying those files because /tmp is owned by root basically even though /tmp/fuse is owned by you. Though I don't know what sort of restrictions would that impose, at worse it may cause stale mounts
2011-04-24T20:55:00.000Z	nbubuntu	psycho_oreos	:  tested again , application still launch but some function not working . hm.. .will inspect it again
2011-04-24T20:56:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	nbubuntu	I'm sure the application requires root access in that case
2011-04-24T20:59:00.000Z	nbubuntu	psycho_oreos	: anyhow it's working after entering the password . Thanks for the support and  help :D
