2007-06-07T14:13:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter		kk got terminal
2007-06-07T14:13:00.000Z	Yert	Pirate_Hunter	on a default ubuntu install, the first user is still not root - type sudo -s at a console, then your user password, then you'll have a root shell.  If you insist on enabling root access, then you can type passwd at that prompt to set the root password
2007-06-07T14:17:00.000Z	Yert	Pirate_Hunter	have you looked under /media?  ubuntu automounts a lot of block devices on boot up
2007-06-07T14:29:00.000Z	Yert	Pirate_Hunter	there is a commercial AV from McAfee, but seriously - there's 2 virii for Linux, and they're both proof of concepts - ie, lab experiements
2007-06-07T14:36:00.000Z	Yert	Pirate_Hunter	use Synaptic to download and install them
2007-06-07T14:36:00.000Z	Yert	Pirate_Hunter	if they're RPMs, try finding the package in the ubuntu repository that matches
2007-06-07T14:38:00.000Z	Yert	Pirate_Hunter	if it's not int he repository, then you'll have to get alien
2007-06-07T14:39:00.000Z	Yert	Pirate_Hunter	repository - ie, storage database.  Not something you have to worry about - the ubuntu repository has thousands of software packages in it.  Go to System -> Administration -> Synaptic Package Manager
2007-06-07T14:39:00.000Z	Yert	Pirate_Hunter	there's a search button there
2007-06-07T14:40:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Yert	found it do i mark all the options or just some
2007-06-07T14:41:00.000Z	Yert	Pirate_Hunter	search for what you're wanting to install - if you try to install them all, you'll be downloading packages until Christmas :)
2007-06-07T14:42:00.000Z	Yert	Pirate_Hunter	mark the one you want, it'll mark all the dependencies, and if it needs anything else, it'll download it
2007-06-07T14:43:00.000Z	Yert	Pirate_Hunter	you bet
2007-06-07T14:43:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Yert	how long does it take for a new user to get good at using ubuntu and i eman at using the terminal as well
2007-06-07T14:44:00.000Z	Yert	Pirate_Hunter	that's a loaded question if I've ever heard one :)
2007-06-07T14:44:00.000Z	Yert	Pirate_Hunter	I converted a friend from Windows to Ubuntu in less than a year - within 2 years, he'd completely quit using Windows altogether
2007-06-07T16:40:00.000Z	Yert	Pirate_Hunter	excellent!  tar xvjf MoBlock-0.8-i586.tar.bz2; cd MoBlock-0.8-i586; ./configure; make install
2007-06-07T16:42:00.000Z	Yert	Pirate_Hunter	yes, but guyzmo is right - you may run into a dependency that's needed.  If so, write it down, go find it, download (or apt-get) it, lather, rinse, repeat.
2007-06-07T16:42:00.000Z	Yert	Pirate_Hunter	that's why apt-get is so cool (or synaptic - it's a pretty front-end for apt-get)
2007-06-07T16:44:00.000Z	Yert	Pirate_Hunter	dependency - something a program depends on to you
2007-06-07T05:01:00.000Z	Yert	Pirate_Hunter	you don't need a software firewall, use iptables - it's part of the kernel.  google for "ubuntu smoothwall" if you want an easy interface
