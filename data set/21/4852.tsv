2008-02-06T22:01:00.000Z	L3ttuc3		how do i force fsck at bootup?
2008-02-06T22:02:00.000Z	Pici	L3ttuc3	sudo touch /forcefsck
2008-02-06T22:02:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	Pici	damn, and i thought there was some more elegant way of doing it!
2008-02-06T22:02:00.000Z	Pici	L3ttuc3	I think theres a reboot or shutdown switch to do it as well.
2008-02-06T22:03:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	Pici	-f i think.
2008-02-06T22:03:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	Pici	uh, no, -F...
2008-02-06T22:04:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	Pici	manpages have nothing about /forcefsck. tsk. annoying.
2008-02-11T18:32:00.000Z	Pici	L3ttuc3	er, thats an odd way of using find.
2008-02-11T18:32:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	Pici	or that :P, never knew the exact parameters for find. guess i'll have to look it up.
2008-02-11T18:32:00.000Z	Pici	L3ttuc3	find / -iname "*foobar*"
2008-02-11T18:33:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	Pici	im starting to like your solution already.
2008-02-11T18:33:00.000Z	Pici	L3ttuc3	I used to do it the way you said until someone told me I was doing it wrong too ;)
2008-02-11T18:34:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	Pici	makes sense. :)
2008-02-20T20:07:00.000Z	Pici	L3ttuc3	You can use esc-\ and esc-/ to move to the top and bottom of your file.
2008-02-20T20:08:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	Pici	but there's no way to place the cursor there by default, then? it's not a big problem... but it would be nice.
2008-02-20T20:09:00.000Z	Pici	L3ttuc3	Not that I can see.. you could try lookin through .nanorc though.  I use a modified version to enable syntax hilighting, I think theres a basic copy of it somewhere, check nano's manpage.
2008-02-20T20:09:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	Pici	i mean, would it be possible to send those escape sequences to nano, on the command line where im opening the file, by using pipes or something?
2008-02-20T20:10:00.000Z	Pici	L3ttuc3	I'm not really sure.... check out /usr/share/doc/nano/examples/nanorc.sample for the .nanorc file though./
2008-02-20T20:12:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	Pici	i had read man nano, didn't know there was a man nanorc, im on that right now, thanks. on the other hand, how would you redirect ESC+/ (for example) to a text file (ie, non-printing character), for future reference?
2008-02-20T20:12:00.000Z	Pici	L3ttuc3	I dont know :/
2008-02-20T20:12:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	Pici	oh well, thanks anyway :).
