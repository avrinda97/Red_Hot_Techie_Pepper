2006-05-31T07:28:00.000Z	Inazad	Healot	I have an old Sharp Palm and it work by the COM' port.. How I can detect the port because the program (emulated by wine) doesn't found the port COM...
2006-05-31T07:30:00.000Z	Inazad	Healot	ya but Linux doesn't detect the COM' port ...
2006-05-31T07:30:00.000Z	Inazad	Healot	wich applications use a COM port ?
2006-05-31T07:30:00.000Z	Inazad	Healot	loll
2006-05-31T07:31:00.000Z	Healot	Inazad	do you know the port for tht COM in windows? COM1/2/3 etc?
2006-05-31T07:31:00.000Z	Inazad	Healot	I think it's COM 1
2006-05-31T07:32:00.000Z	Healot	Inazad	what device name did you use to detect hardware connected to that COM in linux?
2006-05-31T07:32:00.000Z	Inazad	Healot	device name %?
2006-05-31T07:33:00.000Z	Inazad	Healot	hmm I'm noob to Linux so.. I think yes
2006-05-31T07:34:00.000Z	Inazad	Healot	If I use the port COM 1 in windows, I think is ttyS1
2006-05-31T07:34:00.000Z	Inazad	Healot	ok
2006-05-31T07:35:00.000Z	Healot	Inazad	os I guess you got the wrong port :)
2006-05-31T07:35:00.000Z	Inazad	Healot	I think I have to put a symbolic link in my wine/dosdevices...
2006-05-31T07:35:00.000Z	Inazad	Healot	I'll try
2006-05-31T07:37:00.000Z	Inazad	Healot	or maybe it's COM2???
2006-05-31T07:37:00.000Z	Healot	Inazad	if your Windows says so, then it's /dev/ttyS1 (COM2)
2006-05-31T07:38:00.000Z	Inazad	Healot	How many COM port we have ?
2006-05-31T07:39:00.000Z	Inazad	Healot	When I click on AutoDetect in my program, my palm is open and it said Communicating... when I click so the port and my palm can communicate
