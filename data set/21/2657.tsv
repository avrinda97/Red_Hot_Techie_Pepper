2009-08-04T08:09:00.000Z	gogeta	AvonGenesis	just in case you have issues
2009-08-04T08:10:00.000Z	AvonGenesis	gogeta	Well, there is no old kernel on that list, there are two kernels named differently though, one that is meant for netbook and one that says generic.
2009-08-04T08:10:00.000Z	gogeta	AvonGenesis	so what the issue
2009-08-04T08:11:00.000Z	AvonGenesis	gogeta	I want to be able to boot into the netbook kernel but it won't let me so I have to boot into generic.
2009-08-04T08:11:00.000Z	gogeta	AvonGenesis	did it brake
2009-08-04T08:11:00.000Z	AvonGenesis	gogeta	well, I think it did, it stopped letting me boot into it after i restarted for an update.
2009-08-04T08:12:00.000Z	gogeta	AvonGenesis	slect the netbook kernel in synaptic and slect reinstall
2009-08-04T08:12:00.000Z	gogeta	AvonGenesis	maybe the upgrade whent badly
2009-08-04T08:13:00.000Z	AvonGenesis	gogeta	Yea, thats what I'm thinking went wrong. So I've been looking for an answer to either fix it or reinstall it.
2009-08-04T08:13:00.000Z	gogeta	AvonGenesis	just mark for reinstall in synaptic
2009-08-04T08:14:00.000Z	gogeta	AvonGenesis	use quick search and type netbook you should find it
2009-08-04T08:15:00.000Z	AvonGenesis	gogeta	Yup, thanks, this is the answer that I have been looking for, hopefully this will fix my problem. I'll try it out and hope it works.
