2010-02-27T16:13:00.000Z	fedora_newb		anyone know how on either gedit/bluefish to highlight a matching tag? for example, the </html> tag would highlight when on the <html> tag>
2010-02-27T16:13:00.000Z	fedora_newb		?
2010-02-27T16:14:00.000Z	red	fedora_newb	I'd like that too (used to it on notepad++
2010-02-27T16:14:00.000Z	fedora_newb	red	me to :P
2010-02-27T16:15:00.000Z	red	fedora_newb	I use Geany (better than Bluefish imho, not too bloated)
2010-02-27T16:15:00.000Z	red		what it does is hilights programming tags atleast
2010-02-27T16:15:00.000Z	red		like if ( blabla ) {
2010-02-27T16:15:00.000Z	red		and when you are at the ending }Â the opening { it accompanies is bolded
2010-02-27T16:15:00.000Z	fedora_newb	red	i was using gedit, but read somewhere that bluefish the the tag highlighting, but it doesnt
2010-02-27T16:15:00.000Z	red		give a go for geany
2010-02-27T16:16:00.000Z	red		absolutely the best replacement for notepad++ i've found
2010-02-27T16:16:00.000Z	fedora_newb	red	does it do tag highlighting or is there a plugin for it?
2010-02-27T16:16:00.000Z	red		and I used the aforementioned for years :)
2010-02-27T16:16:00.000Z	red		let me see
2010-02-27T16:17:00.000Z	red	fedora_newb	seems it only does braces hilighting, not html tags. dunno if theres a plugin for it. if you do find something that does it, please throw me a /msg :)
2010-02-27T16:18:00.000Z	fedora_newb	red	will do, thanks for the info
2010-02-27T16:25:00.000Z	red		oh and fedora_newb, you could always use the [-] on the left side to minimize the div
2010-02-27T16:25:00.000Z	red	fedora_newb	that way you would see matching tag easily :)
2010-02-27T16:25:00.000Z	fedora_newb	red	still want the tag highlight :P
2010-02-27T16:26:00.000Z	red		me too :)
2010-02-27T16:32:00.000Z	fedora_newb	red	how do you get rid of the line in the middle of the page?
