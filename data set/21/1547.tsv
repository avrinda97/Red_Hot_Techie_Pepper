2010-08-15T04:51:00.000Z	syslq		Alghough it's ugly :)
2010-08-15T04:53:00.000Z	syslq		No sound or fscked sound?
2010-08-15T04:53:00.000Z	syslq		Go from pulse audio to alsa in sound preferences
2010-08-15T04:53:00.000Z	syslq		then check alsamixer
2010-08-15T04:54:00.000Z	headkase314	syslq	do you mean "gstreamer-properties" in a terminal, that is where I set my sound system to alsa
2010-08-15T04:55:00.000Z	syslq	headkase314	no, I mean what I said, sound properties, from pulse audio 2 alsa
2010-08-15T04:55:00.000Z	headkase314	syslq	okey doke.
2010-08-15T04:57:00.000Z	syslq	headkase314	you were right
2010-08-15T04:57:00.000Z	headkase314	syslq	luck.  I learn more here than anything else ;)
2010-08-15T04:58:00.000Z	syslq	headkase314	it was in the menu in some old releases under sound, but it just works now for several releases
2010-08-15T05:06:00.000Z	headkase314	syslq	CA0110 Digital is an X-fi device: -> http://www.google.ca/#hl=en&source=hp&q=linux+CA0110+Digital&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=&fp=e152ff60f580dc26
2010-08-15T05:07:00.000Z	syslq	headkase314	x-fi?
2010-08-15T05:07:00.000Z	headkase314	syslq	that's what google is saying..
2010-08-15T05:10:00.000Z	headkase314	syslq	is it possible that BlueIceVirus has both analog and digital ports on his computer and the speakers are analog and only the digital is showing in gstreamer?
2010-08-15T05:11:00.000Z	syslq	headkase314	could be
2010-08-15T05:20:00.000Z	headkase314	syslq	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/alsa-driver/+bug/463829 the last comments say this issue is still valid in Lucid
2010-08-15T05:27:00.000Z	headkase314	syslq	instructions to compile latest alsa (1.0.23 - http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Main_Page) on Ubuntu 10.04 -> http://monespaceperso.org/blog-en/2010/05/02/upgrade-alsa-1-0-23-on-ubuntu-lucid-lynx-10-04/ Do you think the most current ALSA would help?
2010-08-15T05:28:00.000Z	syslq	headkase314	let's leave that for the end :)
2010-08-16T00:35:00.000Z	syslq	headkase314	did that guy solved sound problems later?
2010-08-16T00:36:00.000Z	headkase314	syslq	the updated ALSA gave him an additional "analog" x-fi device but it also did not work.  In the end last night he was really considering just buying a $10 generic audio card to replace the x-fi
2010-08-16T00:37:00.000Z	syslq	headkase314	lol :)
