2007-02-16T15:33:00.000Z	vlt	linxeh	export LANG didn't help
2007-02-16T15:33:00.000Z	linxeh	vlt	I suspect that something changed in a script elsewhere then
2007-02-16T15:34:00.000Z	vlt	linxeh	but how can I revert what the script (wtf ever it was) did?
2007-02-16T15:34:00.000Z	linxeh	vlt	check the other replies I gave
2007-02-16T15:36:00.000Z	linxeh	vlt	a scirpt, unless you ran it as root, shouldnt change the locale permanently. you cant change the locale an app is using if its already running afaik - you need to restart them, it might be you need to logout and in again too
2007-02-16T15:38:00.000Z	vlt	linxeh	omg, KDE and all the other apps are running for 63 days now. What on earth could have changed LANG to "C" suddenly?
2007-02-16T15:40:00.000Z	linxeh	vlt	have you logged out and back in yet ?
2007-02-16T15:40:00.000Z	linxeh	vlt	did you check /etc/environment ?
2007-02-16T15:40:00.000Z	linxeh	vlt	and have you checked ~/.profile, .bash_profile and .bashrc ?
2007-02-16T15:45:00.000Z	vlt	linxeh	/etc/environment: LANG="de_DE.UTF-8", ~/.profile doesn't exist, ~/.bash_profile nearly only includes ~/.bashrc which hasn't been modified since dapper got stable ...
2007-02-16T16:02:00.000Z	linxeh	vlt	log out and back in
2011-01-09T23:23:00.000Z	linxeh	vlt	on the front page, where it says DOWNLOAD UBUNTU in big letters
2011-01-09T23:23:00.000Z	linxeh	vlt	here is a link http://www.google.co.uk/search?sourceid=chrome&client=ubuntu&channel=cs&ie=UTF-8&q=download+ubuntu
2011-01-09T23:25:00.000Z	vlt	linxeh	That's the page I've been looking before. Still can't find it ... :(
2011-01-09T23:28:00.000Z	linxeh	vlt	really? can you not click the "start download" button ?
2011-01-09T23:28:00.000Z	vlt	linxeh	I was looking for the URL
2011-01-09T23:29:00.000Z	vlt	linxeh	Can you help (maybe I'm blind)
2011-01-09T23:30:00.000Z	linxeh	vlt	if you are blind, then apologies.
2011-01-09T23:30:00.000Z	vlt	linxeh	I'm not. But still not able to find the dowsload URL
2011-01-09T23:32:00.000Z	linxeh	vlt	gobbe it does
