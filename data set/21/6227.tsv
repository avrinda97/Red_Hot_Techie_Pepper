2007-05-09T08:29:00.000Z	non|inear		in gnome when i try to open things under administration (e.g. network, users and groups), the window comes up but is blank... enentyually i kill it, or it says not responding... this doen't happn for everything, but it does for like 5 or 6 of the most important ones.  also, when i open gedit from terminal, it comes up but won't load any files... are these problems related?  how can i fix them?
2007-05-09T08:30:00.000Z	cparker	non|inear	all files?
2007-05-09T08:30:00.000Z	cparker	non|inear	or just files that require root access to read/write them?
2007-05-09T08:33:00.000Z	non|inear	cparker	sorry my food wasw ready.... well, i think i've only tried a coup,le of files with gedit... menu.lst is one
2007-05-09T08:34:00.000Z	non|inear		i'll try one that doesn't need root
2007-05-09T08:36:00.000Z	cparker	non|inear	you need to launch gedit with gksudo if you want to write files such as menu.lst. you should still be able to open it for reading normally, though.
2007-05-09T08:36:00.000Z	non|inear	cparker	ok yea i can open files that i have rw too... but when i use gksudo and enter my password, it says password not authenticated (it's correct tho) and when i try to use just sudo the gedit is blank
2007-05-09T08:37:00.000Z	cparker	non|inear	are you /sure/ you're entering the right password? correct case and all?
2007-05-09T08:37:00.000Z	non|inear		yeap
2007-05-09T08:37:00.000Z	non|inear		i'm sure
2007-05-09T08:37:00.000Z	cparker		you don't have spaces in your password or anything like that, do you?
2007-05-09T08:38:00.000Z	non|inear	cparker	k now when i use gksudo, it's not asking for or denying the pass, but it's not loading gedit
2007-05-09T08:38:00.000Z	cparker	non|inear	are you doing anything differently?
2007-05-09T08:39:00.000Z	non|inear	cparker	nope, just that i've already entered/failed the password, and then used sudo
2007-05-09T08:41:00.000Z	non|inear	cparker	says "no process killed"
2007-05-09T08:41:00.000Z	cparker	non|inear	you didn't recently change your hostname, did you?
2007-05-09T08:42:00.000Z	non|inear		nope
2007-05-09T08:42:00.000Z	non|inear		i restored the ubuntu partition from an image, but this was happening before that
2007-05-09T08:43:00.000Z	non|inear	cparker	I also have problems loading windows for admin stuff like Network and Users and Groups and Services... not sure if that's ralated to this or not
2007-05-09T08:44:00.000Z	non|inear		lol
2007-05-09T08:44:00.000Z	cparker	non|inear	maybe there's something wrong with your GNOME. *shrug*
