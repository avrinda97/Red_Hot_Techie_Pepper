2010-10-08T17:02:00.000Z	MarcRichter		esn't recognise this when it comes to updates.
2010-10-08T17:03:00.000Z	jrib	MarcRichter	what do you mean when you say "apt doesn't recognise this"?
2010-10-08T17:06:00.000Z	MarcRichter	jrib	When I install this packet and issue an "apt-get dist-upgrade" afterwards, apt wants to install the PHP Packages out of the repo and overwrites my custom build ones.
2010-10-08T17:07:00.000Z	MarcRichter	jrib	It doesn't recognise that they ARE allready installed and up-to-date, but custom-build.
2010-10-08T17:07:00.000Z	jrib	MarcRichter	apt installs the latest version available in the repositories, if that's not what you want, you need to tell it so
2010-10-08T17:07:00.000Z	jrib	MarcRichter	pastebin "apt-cache policy PACKAGE"
2010-10-08T17:10:00.000Z	MarcRichter	jrib	But didn't I install the latest version by building it from the sources I get by issuing "apt-get -y source php5"?
2010-10-08T17:10:00.000Z	MarcRichter	jrib	And I don't know what you mean by "pastebin "apt-cache policy PACKAGE""
2010-10-08T17:10:00.000Z	jrib	MarcRichter	I don't know what you did, pastebin the output of the command
2010-10-08T17:10:00.000Z	jrib	MarcRichter	run the command in a terminal
2010-10-08T17:11:00.000Z	MarcRichter	jrib	Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah, OK, you want me to send my output to pastebin. Allright :)
2010-10-08T17:39:00.000Z	MarcRichter	jrib	Here's my pastebin you asked for: http://pastebin.com/4L1uJaak
2010-10-08T17:39:00.000Z	MarcRichter	jrib	As you might notice, the output before my self-installed version and the repo-version isn't differing.
2010-10-08T17:45:00.000Z	jrib	MarcRichter	it's the same version, and the repositories have preference.  Did you actually make changes to the package?
2010-10-08T17:47:00.000Z	MarcRichter	jrib	Yes. I "sed'ed" debian/rules like this:
2010-10-08T17:48:00.000Z	jrib	MarcRichter	then you should increment the version (dch -i) and append something like "~marcrichter1" to the version number as well.  Or just use pinning.  The latter is nicer because apt will try to upgrade it if there's actually a NEW version in the repositories, so you'll know to rebuild
2010-10-08T17:48:00.000Z	MarcRichter	jrib	This is to use external gdlib, since we need several features from this, as described here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/php5/+bug/39719
2010-10-08T17:49:00.000Z	jrib	MarcRichter	and check out the "-i" switch to sed :P
2010-10-08T17:50:00.000Z	MarcRichter	jrib	But - when I install my package like I have and use pinning NOW, then apt tells about a kept back update today allready, since it keeps back the repo one. How could I not miss an update with this?
2010-10-08T17:51:00.000Z	MarcRichter	jrib	Thanks for the "sed -i" - tip :)
2010-10-08T17:52:00.000Z	jrib	MarcRichter	hmm, I don't remember apt acting like that, but I tend to use the other method and avoid pinning for this situation anyway
