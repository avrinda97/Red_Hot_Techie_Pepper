2005-09-03T16:30:00.000Z	topyli	intelikey	anyway, use dpkg directly if you want to break stuff
2005-09-03T16:30:00.000Z	topyli	intelikey	why would you want to uninstall another package's dependencies?
2005-11-02T13:21:00.000Z	topyli	intelikey	with a default installation, gdm should start automatically. if you don't install gdm, just use startx
2005-11-02T13:21:00.000Z	topyli	intelikey	is your X broken?
2005-11-02T13:22:00.000Z	topyli	intelikey	if there's no startx, you don't have a working X installation
2005-11-23T15:18:00.000Z	intelikey	topyli	he mounted an iso on $HOME
2005-11-23T15:19:00.000Z	intelikey	topyli	it's home not desktop
2005-11-23T15:20:00.000Z	topyli	intelikey	oh, ok. (he said 'over my desktop', which confused me)
2005-11-23T15:22:00.000Z	topyli	intelikey	can't umount $HOME easily while logged in. can you give device names as arguments to umount?
2005-12-06T16:14:00.000Z	topyli	intelikey	no, but it does mount stuff automatically
2005-12-06T16:15:00.000Z	topyli	intelikey	supermount is pretty much mandrake's own hobby
2005-12-06T16:15:00.000Z	intelikey	topyli	hal ?
2005-12-06T16:15:00.000Z	topyli	intelikey	gnome-volume-manager. i guess it works though hal magic in its innyrds
2005-12-06T16:17:00.000Z	topyli	intelikey	true. hotplug it is then. or something ;-)
2005-12-06T16:18:00.000Z	topyli	intelikey	i used mandrake for years. release after release, i ended up disabling supermount. it's a complete dog
2005-12-06T16:19:00.000Z	intelikey	topyli	in 10 it works pretty good.
2005-12-06T16:19:00.000Z	topyli	intelikey	oh. i don't think i ever had 10. was with debian by then
2005-12-06T16:20:00.000Z	topyli	intelikey	urpmi goodness taught me that the debian way is the easy way for adminning a linux box :)
2005-12-06T16:26:00.000Z	topyli	intelikey	that's how supermount was always supposed to work. seems they finally got it working :)
2005-12-06T16:26:00.000Z	topyli	intelikey	mind you, for some people, on some systems, it always worked well
2005-12-06T16:27:00.000Z	intelikey	topyli	yeah but until 10 it didn't for me.
