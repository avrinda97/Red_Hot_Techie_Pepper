2011-06-01T20:57:00.000Z	razorsharp	joshuau	make sure your machine boots from cd, check the bios.
2011-06-01T20:57:00.000Z	joshuau		how do i do that??
2011-06-01T20:58:00.000Z	joshuau		no it works fine on my 2008 pc but not on my 2003 pc
2011-06-01T20:59:00.000Z	razorsharp	joshuau	it's different from bios to bios, try hitting the DEL key repeadedly while booting. if that doesn't get you there, try F2, some also use F11 or F12
2011-06-01T20:59:00.000Z	joshuau		ok lets say i get to the system setup screen, what do i do then???
2011-06-01T21:00:00.000Z	joshuau		...
2011-06-01T21:01:00.000Z	razorsharp	joshuau	there should be a boot option, should be obvious if not well walk you thru.
2011-06-01T21:02:00.000Z	joshuau		Yes OK OK but i think the boot order is fine . it boots the dvd drive first anyway.
2011-06-01T21:03:00.000Z	joshuau		maybe i need ubuntu 7 or 8 but where are they?
2011-06-01T21:04:00.000Z	joshuau	BluesKaj	that is correct
2011-06-01T21:05:00.000Z	joshuau		where, where, oh where do i find an alternative install?????????????????????
2011-06-01T21:05:00.000Z	joshuau		ok i see it now.
2011-06-01T21:07:00.000Z	razorsharp	joshuau	look at the bios just to be sure, because cd drivers get initialized at boot, so you would think it is trying to boot from cd.
2011-06-01T21:08:00.000Z	joshuau		look at the bios... what am i looking for?
2011-06-01T21:09:00.000Z	joshuau		no its a blinkin' dvd drive !
2011-06-01T21:09:00.000Z	joshuau		boot priority fine
2011-06-01T21:10:00.000Z	joshuau		1, dvd.... 2, hdd, .... 3, cd
2011-06-01T21:10:00.000Z	razorsharp	joshuau	put the hdd at the very end
