2007-08-14T12:14:00.000Z	teKnofreak	Shaye	in KDE it is in control center --> regional and languages
2007-08-14T12:17:00.000Z	Shaye	teKnofreak	I have "Language support"
2007-08-14T12:18:00.000Z	teKnofreak	Shaye	try logging out, then change in the languages under login menu, relogin
2007-08-14T12:24:00.000Z	teKnofreak	Shaye	?
2007-08-14T12:25:00.000Z	teKnofreak	Shaye	:-s ohhh
2007-08-14T12:25:00.000Z	teKnofreak	Shaye	is the language you want listed there ?
2007-08-14T12:25:00.000Z	teKnofreak	Shaye	check the menus, are they in your language ?
2007-08-14T12:26:00.000Z	Shaye	teKnofreak	 no, everything is in english, I don't want the softwares/os itself to be in that language I just want to be able to type/search in that language
2007-08-14T12:27:00.000Z	teKnofreak	Shaye	ah, then try SCIM :)
2007-08-14T12:28:00.000Z	teKnofreak	Shaye	which language are you trying ?
2007-08-14T12:28:00.000Z	Shaye	teKnofreak	Hebrew, but it's listen everywhere, I just think I need to enable it somehow
2007-08-14T12:30:00.000Z	teKnofreak	Shaye	for me, in KDE, if i go to "regional/languages' in control center, i have to install "hebrew" and then bring it to the top of the list to enable it
2007-08-14T12:31:00.000Z	Shaye	teKnofreak	 but I installed it from the synpatic first
2007-08-14T12:31:00.000Z	teKnofreak	Shaye	what did you install ?
2007-08-14T12:32:00.000Z	teKnofreak	Shaye	if you have installed font, it wont enable the language
2007-08-14T12:34:00.000Z	Shaye	teKnofreak	 OK i uninstalled the packages, then went to regional/language, it installed hebrew package, now how do i type in hebrew? like in windows that u have en/he for example, and u switch with ALT+SHIFT
2007-08-14T12:38:00.000Z	Shaye	teKnofreak	 thanks, it's now all good ;).
2007-08-14T12:38:00.000Z	teKnofreak	Shaye	welcome :)
