2012-11-13T01:57:00.000Z	zykotick9	GregMathis	debian stable, still uses gnome2 and will be supported for longer then ubuntu 10.04... just pointing out another option.
2012-11-13T01:57:00.000Z	GregMathis	zykotick9	anything debian based that is similar to ubuntu?
2012-11-13T01:58:00.000Z	GregMathis	zykotick9	i just want debian based with large community that allows you to use gnome
2012-11-13T01:58:00.000Z	GregMathis	zykotick9	almost seems 10.04 is best bet
2012-11-13T02:00:00.000Z	GregMathis	zykotick9	i have installed those and select those while logging inm but stil do not do anything when i right click the panel
2012-11-13T02:00:00.000Z	zykotick9	GregMathis	for customiability, both unity and gnome3 are not your friends...
2012-11-13T02:01:00.000Z	GregMathis	zykotick9	damn just the panel  you'd figure that would be something easily moved
2012-11-13T02:44:00.000Z	zykotick9	GregMathis	10.04 is only supported gnome2 ubuntu install... and only for a number of months!
2012-11-13T02:44:00.000Z	GregMathis	zykotick9	but what is the worst that means? the futurte apps wont work for it?
2012-11-13T02:45:00.000Z	GregMathis	zykotick9	or just that for gnome issues ill need to hit the #gnome channel instead of this one? what exactly about it is going ot be unsupported?
2012-11-13T02:45:00.000Z	zykotick9	GregMathis	when lucid support is dropped = you should stop using that install!  no security updates!
2012-11-13T02:45:00.000Z	GregMathis	zykotick9	wow ubuntu is startingt to make me sad-
2012-11-13T02:45:00.000Z	GregMathis	zykotick9	is there any dist that is what ubuntu used to be?
2012-11-13T02:46:00.000Z	zykotick9	GregMathis	ubuntu made me sad a long time ago ;)  debian...
2012-11-13T02:47:00.000Z	zykotick9	GregMathis	you can share blame between ubuntu and gnome for that one...
2012-11-13T02:47:00.000Z	GregMathis	zykotick9	i saw that short video of nelson mandela  on one of the ubuntu releases and rememebr thinking "i hope this isn't their lead programmer"
2012-11-13T02:48:00.000Z	zykotick9	GregMathis	i agree with jrib, switch DE/WMs!  xfce is "closest" to gnome2, but a poor replacement IMO... best of luck.  i just dropped DEs altogether, and couldn't be happier - but that's just me, my needs are minimal.
2012-11-13T02:54:00.000Z	zykotick9	GregMathis	you're talking about something people where crying about a long time ago, you are late to the party ;)  ubuntu/gnome3/win8 all seem to be headed in a similar, little customization direction - "users are idiots" mentality.  if you want customization, go elsewhere.  try xfce!  it's closest to what you are use to - and with customization, you can make it look however you want...
2012-11-13T02:55:00.000Z	GregMathis	zykotick9	screw it im going gentoo
2012-11-13T02:56:00.000Z	zykotick9	GregMathis	lol gentoo, (i used it for years)  enjoy the breakages ;)  roll-distro = non-stable
2012-11-13T02:56:00.000Z	GregMathis	zykotick9	i was kidding because of it's rep for being hard to use
