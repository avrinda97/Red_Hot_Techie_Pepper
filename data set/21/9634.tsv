2005-08-11T16:58:00.000Z	carlson		i have a doubt! The Synaptic packages can only be use to update / install softwares by the net or there is a way to install download .deb or .rpm packages using it?

2005-08-11T16:59:00.000Z	Blissex	carlson	please dont repeat questions more often than about every 5 mins
2005-08-11T05:00:00.000Z	Blissex	carlson	the answer is ''yes'' :-)
2005-08-11T05:00:00.000Z	carlson	Blissex	sorry man, but i am very excitated with my fresh version of ubuntu lol
2005-08-11T05:00:00.000Z	carlson	Blissex	 and the question is how??
2005-08-11T05:00:00.000Z	Blissex	carlson	people here dont like Ubuntu questions, there is #ubuntu...
2005-08-11T05:01:00.000Z	Blissex	carlson	the best way would be to set up a local APT repository area, and add that to the '/etc/apt/sources.list'
2005-08-11T05:02:00.000Z	carlson	Blissex	i didnt understand what you d mean with "peoplew here dont like ubuntu questions"
2005-08-11T05:02:00.000Z	carlson	Blissex	but thanks you for the tip
2005-08-11T05:02:00.000Z	Blissex	carlson	there is a separate channel for Ubuntu related questions.
2005-08-11T05:02:00.000Z	Blissex	carlson	wait a sec for a link anyhow.
2005-08-11T05:03:00.000Z	carlson	Blissex	well sorry for the question, but the channel topic is "Have a question? Just ask"
2005-08-11T05:04:00.000Z	carlson	Blissex	lol, now i am undesrtaning :D
2005-08-11T05:04:00.000Z	Blissex	carlson	this will tell you all about APT :-) http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-howto/
2005-08-11T05:04:00.000Z	carlson	Blissex	my last question: Is there a list of cool web repositories to APT, or whatever can i call it?
2005-08-11T05:05:00.000Z	Blissex	carlson	yes, and they are dangerous, but: http://WWW.apt-get.org/
2005-08-11T05:05:00.000Z	carlson	Blissex	 not so dangerous as I am behind vmware ;)
2005-08-11T05:06:00.000Z	Blissex	carlson	also, use 'aptitude' in preference to 'synaptic' if you want to do dangerous things
2005-08-11T05:06:00.000Z	Blissex	carlson	and look at my sample configu files here: http://WWW.sabi.co.UK/Cfg/APT/
2005-08-11T05:06:00.000Z	carlson	Blissex	well man, thanks a lot for hte help ;)
