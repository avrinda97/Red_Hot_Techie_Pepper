2005-04-30T08:10:00.000Z	jordanau		i hear linux is designed to be left on and not rebooted, is that still the case? is it bad to reboot?
2005-04-30T08:11:00.000Z	jordanau		great, thanks, also is it bad on hardware to leave the computer running?
2005-04-30T08:12:00.000Z	elcu	jordanau	linux is like any other OS.  whether you leave your 'puter on or off is up to you.
2005-04-30T08:12:00.000Z	jordanau	elcu	i appreciate that
2005-04-30T08:15:00.000Z	jordanau	elcu	yeah lmsensor
2005-04-30T08:16:00.000Z	jordanau	elcu	lmsensor + gdesklet, and you ought to be good
2005-04-30T08:16:00.000Z	elcu	jordanau	yech, gdesklets.
2005-04-30T08:16:00.000Z	jordanau	elcu	yeah i know after 2-3 days of trying to get them to work properly, i gave up
2005-04-30T08:17:00.000Z	jordanau	elcu	with lmsensor you can go to terminal, type in a command (i forgot it) and it will give all voltages, temps, fan speeds.
2005-04-30T08:18:00.000Z	elcu	jordanau	ah, goodo.  you based in aus (out of interest)?
2005-04-30T08:18:00.000Z	jordanau	elcu	no not in aus, the command is "sensors" would you like to see my output?
2005-04-30T08:19:00.000Z	elcu	jordanau	sure.
2005-04-30T08:21:00.000Z	jordanau	elcu	the install requires a little work
2005-04-30T08:21:00.000Z	elcu	jordanau	so in those screenshots, they are using gdesklets to have that stacked system monitor i always see.
2005-04-30T08:22:00.000Z	elcu	jordanau	it does?  not a simple matter of just installing the package?
2005-04-30T08:22:00.000Z	jordanau	elcu	yeah all of those sensor gdesklets require lmsensors (at least the ones that measure temp etc.)
2005-04-30T08:23:00.000Z	jordanau	elcu	i think you have to add some modules and stuff
2005-04-30T08:23:00.000Z	elcu	jordanau	lm-sensor?
2005-04-30T08:23:00.000Z	jordanau	elcu	yep
2005-04-30T08:23:00.000Z	jordanau	elcu	then the command to read everything is senso
2005-04-30T08:24:00.000Z	elcu	jordanau	ok
