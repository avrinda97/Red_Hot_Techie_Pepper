2011-04-07T09:27:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	puren00b	You can always try: sudo dpkg --reconfigure xorg-server => see if that straightens ya out.
2011-04-07T09:32:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	puren00b	Mate, hows this sound => boot to the console, login, right? Once ya login, type: dpkg --reconfigure xorg-server
2011-04-07T09:33:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	puren00b	If ya got the point of getting it installed, ya might, stressing MIGHT be able to get Xorg running...
2011-04-07T09:34:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	puren00b	Yes...
2011-04-07T09:35:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	puren00b	Um, mate, did you install all the codecs necessary to play video?
2011-04-07T09:37:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	puren00b	Just FYI, have you thought about using an older version of Ubuntu - like maybe 9.10 or so?
2011-04-07T09:41:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	puren00b	Mate, you can just install it from the console: sudo apt-get install xfce-desktop => and wait...
2011-04-07T09:42:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	puren00b	I reckon about 30mb or so...
2011-04-07T09:44:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	puren00b	It's just a different GUI that doesn't suck up system resource...
2011-04-07T10:06:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	puren00b	Are you at the console, or in the GUI?
2011-04-07T10:06:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	puren00b	SYSTEM => ADMINISTRATION => HARDWARE DRIVERS
