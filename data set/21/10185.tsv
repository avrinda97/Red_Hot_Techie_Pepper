2005-05-26T15:07:00.000Z	choco1ate		liable : http://linmodems.technion.ac.il/Read.scanModem/DriverCompiling.txt <-- here they only ask to install the headers, no mention of source
2005-05-26T15:08:00.000Z	choco1ate		this is the guide i'm trying to follow, you think i should by default have the source already installed :o
2005-05-26T15:08:00.000Z	choco1ate		is that what they are assuming :S
2005-05-26T15:08:00.000Z	liable	choco1ate	I have compiled many smartlink modems, and it *does* need kernel source
2005-05-26T15:10:00.000Z	liable	choco1ate	that does say, it works on debian, so you should be right, so try it I spose, I have always made me own.
2005-05-26T15:14:00.000Z	liable	choco1ate	shouldnt you be using 'sudo make'?
2005-05-26T15:15:00.000Z	liable	choco1ate	thats a header, try 'sudo make' 'sudo make install'
2005-05-26T15:20:00.000Z	liable	choco1ate	cant answer that for sure, but most things that need kernel headers, you compile with sudo, bob2 comment?
2005-05-26T15:21:00.000Z	liable	choco1ate	hehe, well then you can try it, if it fails, install the kernel source, copy the config and make your own
2005-05-26T15:26:00.000Z	liable	choco1ate	hmmm, I just tried to make my slmodem driver as a user and got a permission error, which is different to yours, but, try the sudo thing
2005-05-26T15:33:00.000Z	liable	choco1ate	even the same error as you :)
2005-05-26T15:33:00.000Z	liable	choco1ate	did you get it from that howto page you showed?
2005-05-26T15:39:00.000Z	liable	choco1ate	that driver has some problems I think, is that the only one you could find? is there no source on the proper site for it?
2005-05-26T15:43:00.000Z	liable	choco1ate	wait, have you edited your makefile?
2005-05-26T15:44:00.000Z	liable	choco1ate	I just got mine to compile by changing the kernel path :)
2005-05-26T15:45:00.000Z	liable	choco1ate	join #flood
2005-05-26T15:46:00.000Z	liable	choco1ate	no, dont worry i'll do it here
2005-05-26T15:50:00.000Z	liable	choco1ate	didnt we have this conversation?
2005-05-26T15:52:00.000Z	liable	choco1ate	no, not for you :(
2005-05-26T15:56:00.000Z	liable	choco1ate	cant do
2005-05-26T15:56:00.000Z	liable	choco1ate	you now have your kernel source installed?
