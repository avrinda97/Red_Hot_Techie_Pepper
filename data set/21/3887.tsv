2008-12-21T21:04:00.000Z	Daniel_Mihaly		I got a problem
2008-12-21T21:05:00.000Z	Daniel_Mihaly		"Please insert the disc labeled : Ubuntu-Server 8.10 _Intrepid IBEX_ - RElease i386..."
2008-12-21T21:06:00.000Z	Daniel_Mihaly		What is that?
2008-12-21T21:06:00.000Z	Daniel_Mihaly		I am installing ubuntu server now.
2008-12-21T21:07:00.000Z	Daniel_Mihaly		version ubuntu-8.10-server-i386.iso
2008-12-21T21:08:00.000Z	Daniel_Mihaly		I try base install on IBM old pc.
2008-12-21T21:08:00.000Z	Daniel_Mihaly		The image is ubuntu-8.10-server-i386.iso, whta I try now.
2008-12-21T21:08:00.000Z	Daniel_Mihaly		but it is 1 CD and even it ask for another?...
2008-12-21T21:09:00.000Z	Daniel_Mihaly		Selected packages by install was ssh server and tomcat, that is all.
2008-12-21T21:10:00.000Z	Neaai	Daniel_Mihaly	I haven't tried the server disk, but I think you can easily add all you want after base installation, using apt-get install
2008-12-21T21:12:00.000Z	Neaai	Daniel_Mihaly	you said you have the .iso file. You can not make a cd from that ?
2008-12-21T21:13:00.000Z	Neaai	Daniel_Mihaly	but what is wrong then ?
2008-12-21T21:16:00.000Z	Neaai	Daniel_Mihaly	it asks for the disk that you already have
2008-12-21T21:18:00.000Z	Neaai	Daniel_Mihaly	So you mean the disk waits for itself ?
2008-12-21T21:19:00.000Z	Neaai	Daniel_Mihaly	what was the name of the disk it asks ?
2008-12-21T21:21:00.000Z	Neaai	Daniel_Mihaly	hmm. If that machine is connected to the internet, why don't you just use the online installation and disable the system to use the CD? maybe the disk is damaged, I can't tell.
2008-12-21T21:23:00.000Z	Neaai	Daniel_Mihaly	oh I see. You said the disk has worked ok before ?
2008-12-21T21:24:00.000Z	Neaai	Daniel_Mihaly	maybe it's damaged. if it worked before I can't think why now it says "insert disk" when the disk is there.
2008-12-21T21:26:00.000Z	Neaai	Daniel_Mihaly	you're trying to install intrepid ibex server, I believe? Well, the server disk and the desktop disk are not exactly the same. They install different things.
2008-12-21T21:28:00.000Z	Neaai	Daniel_Mihaly	ok.
2008-12-21T22:05:00.000Z	Neaai	Daniel_Mihaly	I'd think positively that there's nothing 8.10 can do and 8.04 can't :(
