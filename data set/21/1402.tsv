2010-10-06T03:10:00.000Z	mamece2	ejv	yes, write the cover in the file, so it will remain with the cover no matter what player u use

2010-10-06T03:11:00.000Z	mamece2	ejv	i just dont like to install too much apps just to try because i came from windows and windows get slow if u install and unisntall a lot of programs, will this happen to ubuntu too?
2010-10-06T03:12:00.000Z	ejv	mamece2	yea that's nonsense in linux land, don't be afraid to install something, it can be easily removed
2010-10-06T03:12:00.000Z	ejv	mamece2	here's the PPA for it, so you can have cutting edge builds: https://launchpad.net/~banshee-team/+archive/ppa
2010-10-06T03:13:00.000Z	mamece2	ejv	sorry but PPA?
2010-10-06T03:15:00.000Z	ejv	mamece2	the latest builds of banshee very slowly make their way into the official Ubuntu repository(ies). By adding launchpad into your third party sources, you give yourself access to the build team's updates, so you don't have to wait for Ubuntu to approve and add.
2010-10-06T03:15:00.000Z	ejv	mamece2	the process is outlined on the website
2010-10-06T03:19:00.000Z	mamece2	ejv	i only use ubuntu, i dont need grub2 amirite?
2010-10-08T07:18:00.000Z	ejv	mamece2	load a livecd into the virtual OS, then you can repartition or wipe the virtual disk at your leisure.
