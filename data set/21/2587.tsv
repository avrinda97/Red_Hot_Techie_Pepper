2010-01-23T03:26:00.000Z	DJCharlie		eth0 is a direct connection to the net. eth1 is to my home lan (for samba)
2010-01-23T03:27:00.000Z	daftykins	DJCharlie	you tried checking the interfaces file then just rebooting?
2010-01-23T03:27:00.000Z	DJCharlie	daftykins	Several times.
2010-01-23T03:28:00.000Z	DJCharlie	daftykins	zuul is my firewall on eth1.
2010-01-23T03:29:00.000Z	DJCharlie	daftykins	Yes.
2010-01-23T03:30:00.000Z	daftykins	DJCharlie	not that i know of. looks weird that you're getting 254.254 when that'd be of no use at all.
2010-01-23T03:35:00.000Z	daftykins	DJCharlie	can you pastebin your interfaces file?
2010-01-23T03:36:00.000Z	DJCharlie	daftykins	http://pastebin.com/m49832994
2010-01-23T03:38:00.000Z	daftykins	DJCharlie	so your network goes how? cable -> eth0 of PC, eth1 of PC <-> firewall ?
2010-01-23T03:38:00.000Z	DJCharlie	daftykins	Close, but not quite.
2010-01-23T03:38:00.000Z	DJCharlie	daftykins	DSL -> eth0 of PC.
2010-01-23T03:39:00.000Z	DJCharlie	daftykins	Then we have Firewall -> LAN -> eth1 of PC
2010-01-23T03:40:00.000Z	daftykins	DJCharlie	ooh-err, bit more complex than i can follow, what's the route of a packet out to the Internet from a client PC then?
2010-01-23T03:41:00.000Z	DJCharlie	daftykins	That would be: client pc -> Firewall -> outside
2010-01-23T03:41:00.000Z	DJCharlie	daftykins	The ONLY thing eth1 should connect to is the local lan. it shouldn't be using the firewall.
2010-01-23T03:43:00.000Z	daftykins	DJCharlie	hmm that's not how i'd do it, i'd just have the one machine with two interfaces firewall'ing and routing. don't see the need for two separate subnets
2010-01-23T03:44:00.000Z	DJCharlie	daftykins	This system is a server for kjsr.net's streaming feed. We have a dedicated DSL connection for it on eth0.
2010-01-23T03:44:00.000Z	DJCharlie	daftykins	eth1 is just for local access to the shared drives.
2010-01-23T03:46:00.000Z	daftykins	DJCharlie	ok sorry i don't really follow well enough to help. if i wanted to get rid of those routes though i'd either reinstall the OS or backup and delete interfaces to try from scratch
2010-01-23T03:46:00.000Z	DJCharlie	daftykins	Way too drastic.
2010-01-23T04:03:00.000Z	DJCharlie	daftykins	Got the routing fixed, I think... But web is still down.
