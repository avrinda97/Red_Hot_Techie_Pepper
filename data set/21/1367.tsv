2010-10-11T22:59:00.000Z	clone`KillaloT		Hello, yesterday i upgraded to Ubuntu 10.10 Netbook on my Eee PC 901, but i cannot get the Wireless network working?
2010-10-11T23:00:00.000Z	Zavor	clone`KillaloT	You may have proprietary drivers. Make sure they're installed correctly.
2010-10-11T23:01:00.000Z	clone`KillaloT	Zavor	: "There are no proprietary drivers in use on this system"
2010-10-11T23:01:00.000Z	clone`KillaloT	Zavor	: when i search for drivers
2010-10-11T23:02:00.000Z	Zavor	clone`KillaloT	Right-click the networking icon, make sure "Enable Wireless" is chcked.
2010-10-11T23:04:00.000Z	clone`KillaloT	Zavor	: i only got to active normal network, not wireless. That might have something to do with it :D
2010-10-11T23:05:00.000Z	Zavor	clone`KillaloT	You get it fixed then?
2010-10-11T23:05:00.000Z	clone`KillaloT	Zavor	: don't know, but if there should both be a normal network and wireless in the menu, that's the first step i guess :D
2010-10-11T23:06:00.000Z	clone`KillaloT	Zavor	: I'm kinda new, so i gotta find out how to activate it in the first place, but if i'm bothering you guys here with such simple questions it might be messed up :D
2010-10-11T23:06:00.000Z	Zavor	clone`KillaloT	No worries, man, that's what we're here for.
2010-10-11T23:08:00.000Z	Zavor	clone`KillaloT	Left-click on the networking icon on the top right of your screen. Does it show wireless networks now?
2010-10-11T23:09:00.000Z	Zavor	clone`KillaloT	Damn. Might be a question for the guys at ubuntuforums.org. Very helpful people there, try that.
2010-10-11T23:09:00.000Z	clone`KillaloT	Zavor	: iwconfig says no wireless extensions for lo and eth0
2010-10-11T23:09:00.000Z	clone`KillaloT	Zavor	: i will try to see if it's disabled in BIOS
2010-10-11T23:10:00.000Z	Zavor	clone`KillaloT	BIOS would have nothing to do with wireless.
2010-10-11T23:10:00.000Z	Zavor	clone`KillaloT	eth0 is Ethernet and lo is something else.
2010-10-11T23:11:00.000Z	clone`KillaloT	Zavor	: just went to BIOS and it actually HAD disabled the wireless.. , lets see if i can find my network now when booting up. 2 sec
2010-10-11T23:12:00.000Z	Zavor	clone`KillaloT	How the hell? You must be running some odd system, mate, because BIOS shouldn't handle your wireless device. At that, I have to say "What the hell?"
2010-10-11T23:12:00.000Z	clone`KillaloT	Zavor	: nice, now it connects :)
2010-10-11T23:12:00.000Z	Zavor	clone`KillaloT	You're all set then. Enjoy, sir.
2010-10-11T23:13:00.000Z	clone`KillaloT	Zavor	: hahaha :D odd system? :DD I only run Ubuntu 10.10 Netbook on this machine.. upgraded from Ubuntu 10.04 Netbook. But yea, thanks for your help :)
