2011-09-03T02:32:00.000Z	manbra_laptop		Hey, how can I access my windows XP partition from ubuntu 11.04?  They are both on the same hard drives, diff. partitions
2011-09-03T02:32:00.000Z	th0r	manbra_laptop	put a line in fstab mounting the ntfs partition to a mountpoint
2011-09-03T02:34:00.000Z	manbra_laptop	th0r	thank you.  I'm reading up on fstab now.  I think this is what I need
2011-09-03T02:34:00.000Z	th0r	manbra_laptop	you might need to install ntfs-3g, not sure if it is installed by default in ubuntu
2011-09-03T02:41:00.000Z	manbra_laptop	th0r	I'm a bit lost here.  I'm following https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fstab.  I used sudo blkid and found my windows drive on /dev/sda1.  Then I go to /etc/ and put in fstab dev/sda1 and it gives me command not found.  fstab by itself also gives me command not found.  If I dir the directly there is a file in there called fstab
2011-09-03T02:42:00.000Z	manbra_laptop		oh, god damn it.
2011-09-03T02:42:00.000Z	th0r	manbra_laptop	ok...first, make sure you can read/write the partition. Make a folder in your home folder (mkdir /home/username/windowxp
2011-09-03T02:43:00.000Z	th0r	manbra_laptop	then mount the partition there (sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/sda1 /home/username/windowsxp)
2011-09-03T02:43:00.000Z	th0r	manbra_laptop	if it works you should see your windowsxp in that folder in your home dir
2011-09-03T02:44:00.000Z	th0r	manbra_laptop	once you are sure it works, just add the following line to /etc/fstab (sudo nano /etc/fstab)...
2011-09-03T02:45:00.000Z	th0r	manbra_laptop	the line looks like this....../dev/sda1  /home/username/windowsxp ntfs rw,user,noauto 0  0
2011-09-03T02:46:00.000Z	th0r	manbra_laptop	if the mount command doesn't work let me know
2011-09-03T02:46:00.000Z	manbra_laptop	th0r	I got an error message.  One sec, screenshotting.
2011-09-03T02:47:00.000Z	th0r	manbra_laptop	try using -t ntfs-3g in the mount command
2011-09-03T02:48:00.000Z	manbra_laptop	th0r	I made the /home/username directory.  Then I did "sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/sda1 /home/username/windowsxp
2011-09-03T02:49:00.000Z	manbra_laptop		Oh, nvm, I see what I did wrong
2011-09-03T02:54:00.000Z	manbra_laptop	th0r	it mounted.  I can access the partition w/ places and by terminal.  I'm trying to add that line w/ nano.  Does it matter where I put it?  And, how do I save inside of nano?
2011-09-03T02:55:00.000Z	th0r	manbra_laptop	you save with Ctrl-X and then follow the prompts to save. The line should go at the end of the fstab file
2011-09-03T02:55:00.000Z	th0r	manbra_laptop	fyi....the mount command is for one off mounts. If you put the line into /etc/fstab it will automatically mount every time the computer boots
2011-09-03T02:57:00.000Z	manbra_laptop	th0r	thank you for the help.  Sorry for being such a linux nub.
2011-09-03T02:58:00.000Z	th0r	manbra_laptop	I had the same questions once....then the dinosaurs died
