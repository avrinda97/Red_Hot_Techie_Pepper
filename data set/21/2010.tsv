2010-02-24T04:16:00.000Z	band_of_koala	jrib	I can ssh localhost
2010-02-24T04:01:00.000Z	band_of_koala	jrib	it didn't fix it
2010-02-24T04:01:00.000Z	jrib	band_of_koala	was ssh working with the old router?
2010-02-24T04:01:00.000Z	band_of_koala	jrib	yes
2010-02-24T04:01:00.000Z	jrib	band_of_koala	then just forward port 22 to your machine
2010-02-24T04:02:00.000Z	jrib	band_of_koala	that's all there is to do.  It's a router issue
2010-02-24T04:02:00.000Z	band_of_koala	jrib	okay
2010-02-24T04:02:00.000Z	jrib	band_of_koala	how are you testing?
2010-02-24T04:03:00.000Z	band_of_koala	jrib	trying to ssh into it from my dyndns\
2010-02-24T04:03:00.000Z	band_of_koala	jrib	i changed the IP on it so it should be right
2010-02-24T04:03:00.000Z	jrib	band_of_koala	just use the router's ip
2010-02-24T04:05:00.000Z	band_of_koala	jrib	didn't help
2010-02-24T04:05:00.000Z	jrib	band_of_koala	that confirms the issue is that you are not properly forwarding port 22 to your machine
2010-02-24T04:05:00.000Z	band_of_koala	jrib	okay I'll try again
2010-02-24T04:12:00.000Z	band_of_koala	jrib	Global Port(s): 22 Local Port(s): 22
2010-02-24T04:12:00.000Z	band_of_koala	jrib	protocol: both
2010-02-24T04:12:00.000Z	jrib	band_of_koala	so do you believe it's a server issue?
2010-02-24T04:12:00.000Z	band_of_koala	jrib	i have no clue it was working fine yesterday
2010-02-24T04:13:00.000Z	jrib	band_of_koala	go to your server and « ssh localhost ».  Then check for failed ssh logins in the logs.
2010-02-24T04:16:00.000Z	band_of_koala	jrib	and the log changes. But if I do it from my dyndns or ip it doesnt work
2010-02-24T04:17:00.000Z	jrib	band_of_koala	it's a router issue.
