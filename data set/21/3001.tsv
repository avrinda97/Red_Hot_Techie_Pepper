2009-06-09T03:13:00.000Z	VCoolio		I have new 5.1 speakers with alsa running pretty well; but every twenty seconds or so I hear a short sound / click / hickup / whatever you call it, like you sometimes hear when you turn a radio on / off. It's not regular, and not always the same volume. What could it be? Hardware, software, config, where to look?
2009-06-09T03:15:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	VCoolio	are you sure you are not hearing the default sound theme for ubuntu.. does it happen when you click buttons on certain windows?
2009-06-09T03:16:00.000Z	VCoolio	Paddy_EIRE	I have sound theme disabled and it's not reacting on my actions I think
2009-06-09T03:16:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	VCoolio	I am not so sure what might be causing this.. so you have any audible notifications enabled?
2009-06-09T03:17:00.000Z	VCoolio	Paddy_EIRE	yes, with this channel for example in pidgin, works fine
2009-06-09T03:19:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	VCoolio	so this happens just when the machine is sitting idle with no other applications running?
2009-06-09T03:19:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE		!ops
2009-06-09T03:19:00.000Z	VCoolio	Paddy_EIRE	it happens all the time; when I'm doing something or when I just watch this channel flood by; doesn't matter, I don't see a pattern
2009-06-09T03:20:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	VCoolio	how about when you are watching movies.. does it make these noises?
2009-06-09T03:20:00.000Z	VCoolio	Paddy_EIRE	not sure, at least not recognizable
2009-06-09T03:20:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE		hmm
2009-06-09T03:21:00.000Z	VCoolio	Paddy_EIRE	could it be that some audio / sound daemon starts / stops every time?
2009-06-09T03:21:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	VCoolio	hmm
2009-06-09T03:21:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE		good point that could be it
2009-06-09T03:21:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE		pulse does switch off to to speak after a few minutes idle VCoolio
2009-06-09T03:21:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	VCoolio	do you require pulse?
2009-06-09T03:22:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE		!pulse | VCoolio
2009-06-09T03:22:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE		hmm
2009-06-09T03:22:00.000Z	VCoolio		what daemon is alsa? I tried disabling pulse audio as much as possible as it killed all sound
2009-06-09T03:22:00.000Z	VCoolio	Paddy_EIRE	^
2009-06-09T03:22:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	VCoolio	sec I will have a look
