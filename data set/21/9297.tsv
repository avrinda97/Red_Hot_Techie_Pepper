2005-10-17T08:02:00.000Z	Aven		hmm
2005-10-17T08:02:00.000Z	Aven		how do you make files in ACSII mode?
2005-10-17T08:02:00.000Z	Xenguy	Aven	find and use a text editor ?
2005-10-17T08:03:00.000Z	Aven	Xenguy	I mean like...
2005-11-02T11:44:00.000Z	Xenguy	Aven	frankscorner.org...
2005-11-02T11:44:00.000Z	Xenguy	Aven	or gimp.org :P
2005-11-02T11:45:00.000Z	Xenguy	Aven	then pay attention (frankscorner.org)
2005-11-15T08:58:00.000Z	Xenguy	Aven	ssh -l uid host/domain
2005-11-15T08:59:00.000Z	Aven	Xenguy	what's 'uid'?
2005-11-15T08:59:00.000Z	Xenguy	Aven	userid/username
2005-11-15T08:59:00.000Z	Xenguy	Aven	man ssh, it's very cool, and deeper than I've gone too
2006-01-18T12:45:00.000Z	Xenguy	Aven	hi...
2006-01-18T12:47:00.000Z	Xenguy	Aven	hrm, you want to change the appearence of outgoing email for example?
2006-01-18T12:48:00.000Z	Xenguy	Aven	or possible what _jason said is what you want (just trying to get a clearer idea of why and what you want to edit)
2006-01-18T12:49:00.000Z	Xenguy	Aven	just backup the original file :-)
2006-01-18T12:53:00.000Z	Xenguy	Aven	what file?  /etc/hosts ?
2006-01-18T12:54:00.000Z	Xenguy	Aven	if you have no GUI, then yes you can do this from the command-line, but you have to get the correct syntax obviously for it to work...
2006-01-18T12:55:00.000Z	Xenguy	Aven	I don't recall the syntax offhand
2006-01-18T12:55:00.000Z	Xenguy	Aven	Graphical User Interface (icons, stuff you can click)
2006-01-18T12:56:00.000Z	Xenguy	Aven	as opposed to CLI (command-line interface)
2006-01-18T12:56:00.000Z	Xenguy	Aven	that will be easier then in this case...
