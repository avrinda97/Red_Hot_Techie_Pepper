2008-06-16T06:23:00.000Z	Rotonen		so, installed xp, left some empty space, it worked, installed ubuntu and told it to use the remaining free space automatically. now xp does not boot due to the ntldr not being able to find ntoskernel.exe (changing the partition number in boot.ini mysteriously changes the missing file to hal.dll). google, forums and wiki failed on me, any pointers?
2008-06-16T06:23:00.000Z	kimbrel	Rotonen	what’s your current partition map like?
2008-06-16T06:24:00.000Z	kimbrel	Rotonen	put it on a paste site along with relevant sections of your grub.conf/menu.lst
2008-06-16T06:24:00.000Z	Rotonen	kimbrel	in which naming convention?
2008-06-16T06:24:00.000Z	kimbrel	Rotonen	linux, please
2008-06-16T06:24:00.000Z	Rotonen	kimbrel	grub is irrelevant, since ntldr does load?
2008-06-16T06:25:00.000Z	kimbrel	Rotonen	oh, good point.
2008-06-16T06:25:00.000Z	Rotonen	kimbrel	currently in xp recovery console trying chkdisk, but i doubt it would help
2008-06-16T06:26:00.000Z	Rotonen	kimbrel	also adding multiple lines to boot.ini gives me the xp boot menu.. and tried with fedora and the problem does not persist (with fedora it works) hence deeming it ubuntu specific
2008-06-16T06:26:00.000Z	kimbrel		woo netsplit
2008-06-16T06:26:00.000Z	kimbrel	Rotonen	you installed fedora on the same machine and it didn’t screw up your windows install?
2008-06-16T06:26:00.000Z	Rotonen	kimbrel	yep
2008-06-16T06:27:00.000Z	kimbrel	Rotonen	sounds like a bug in the installer then
2008-06-16T06:27:00.000Z	Rotonen	kimbrel	especially yes since 7.10 works fine
2008-06-16T06:27:00.000Z	Rotonen	kimbrel	but any hinters on what might actually be the problem?
2008-06-16T06:27:00.000Z	kimbrel		nope
2008-06-16T06:27:00.000Z	kimbrel		i’m presuming it just scribbled on your XP partition for no good reason
2008-06-16T06:28:00.000Z	kimbrel		when you say “left space” do you mean you left unformatted/unpartitioned space?
2008-06-16T06:28:00.000Z	Rotonen	kimbrel	and my geography roughly: windows as a primary partition and ubuntu and its swap as extended ones (partition 1 and partitions 5+6)
2008-06-16T06:28:00.000Z	Rotonen	kimbrel	yes, unpartitioned space
2008-06-16T06:28:00.000Z	Rotonen	kimbrel	intentionally avoided ntfs resizing with my install procedure
