2005-03-17T15:18:00.000Z	maddog		anyone got time to help an ubuntu noob with a desktop problem?
2005-03-17T15:18:00.000Z	andrewski	maddog	ask away.
2005-03-17T15:20:00.000Z	andrewski	maddog	in nautilus?
2005-03-17T15:21:00.000Z	andrewski	maddog	so just nautilus is freezing?
2005-03-17T15:21:00.000Z	andrewski	maddog	ok, open a terminal and type `killall nautilus`
2005-03-17T15:22:00.000Z	andrewski	maddog	yes, this will happen.  then, in that same terminal, run nautilus again.  (this way, you can see any errors it outputs.)
2005-03-17T15:22:00.000Z	andrewski	maddog	you should get your desktop back.
2005-03-17T15:23:00.000Z	andrewski	maddog	did it give you back your prompt or is it hanging?
2005-03-17T15:23:00.000Z	andrewski	maddog	h/o a sec.
2005-03-17T15:24:00.000Z	andrewski	maddog	did it open a file window at least?
2005-03-17T15:24:00.000Z	andrewski	maddog	try nautilus --check
2005-03-17T15:24:00.000Z	andrewski	maddog	any errors?
2005-03-17T15:25:00.000Z	andrewski	maddog	but nothing prints?
2005-03-17T15:25:00.000Z	andrewski	maddog	"running nautilus_..."
2005-03-17T15:25:00.000Z	andrewski	maddog	hmm.
2005-03-17T15:25:00.000Z	andrewski	maddog	ok, just to be sure, try nautilus -q
2005-03-17T15:26:00.000Z	andrewski	maddog	and then nautilus --check again.
2005-03-17T15:27:00.000Z	andrewski	maddog	well, nautilus -q should hang for a minute, but it should spit you back at your prompt after that...
2005-03-17T15:29:00.000Z	andrewski	maddog	yikes, that's strange.  i'd check #gnome about it, or post a bug report on bugzilla.ubuntu.org
2005-03-17T15:29:00.000Z	andrewski	maddog	sorry i can't help more.
2005-03-17T15:30:00.000Z	andrewski	maddog	well, i don't think that'll work (because that's what i had you do :), but it's worth a shot.
