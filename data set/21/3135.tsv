2009-09-11T22:56:00.000Z	Travis-42		is there any way to force all of my computer's network traffic (including apt) to go through a proxy? I know how to do it on an application by application basis
2009-09-11T22:56:00.000Z	grawity	Travis-42	Set up it as a transparent proxy?
2009-09-11T22:56:00.000Z	Travis-42	grawity	I'll look up about transparent proxies, thanks
2009-09-11T22:56:00.000Z	grawity	Travis-42	But for what reason are you trying to do that?
2009-09-11T22:58:00.000Z	Travis-42	grawity	well mainly seems more secure when I'm on an untrusted wireless connection
2009-09-11T22:58:00.000Z	grawity	Travis-42	I highly doubt it.
2009-09-11T22:59:00.000Z	grawity	Travis-42	If the proxy doesn't use encryption, then it adds exactly zero security.
2009-09-11T22:59:00.000Z	Travis-42	grawity	well I'm using ssh to connect to my home PC.
2009-09-11T22:59:00.000Z	grawity	Travis-42	ssh has an option to create a very simple VPN.
2009-09-11T23:00:00.000Z	Travis-42	grawity	I'll read about that too, anyways
2009-09-11T23:01:00.000Z	grawity	Travis-42	That's what a VPN does.
2009-09-11T23:02:00.000Z	grawity	Travis-42	You can try setting up OpenVPN, or using the tun device support in ssh, or something else.
2009-12-04T23:47:00.000Z	grawity	Travis-42	6 only gives read/write permissions, but not execute. Which means, the directory will _never_ be accessible.
2009-12-04T23:47:00.000Z	grawity	Travis-42	So, you sure you didn't mean 700 and 777?
2009-12-04T23:47:00.000Z	Travis-42	grawity	err, yes that's what I meant :-)
2009-12-04T23:47:00.000Z	grawity	Travis-42	Anyway, for a directory to be accessed, you must have +x perms for all its parents.
2009-12-04T23:48:00.000Z	Travis-42	grawity	ok, that's what I was making sure. thank you :-)
2009-12-24T18:45:00.000Z	grawity	Travis-42	xclip -in -selection clipboard
2009-12-24T18:46:00.000Z	Travis-42	grawity	ah didn't realize I had to change the selection, thanks
2009-12-24T18:46:00.000Z	grawity	Travis-42	Remember that X11 has several separate 'selections'. The 'primary' selection is updated when you select some text - middle-click to paste. The 'clipboard' is updated when you press Ctrl-C.
2009-12-24T18:46:00.000Z	Travis-42	grawity	yea, that's new to me, so I'll have to read about it, thank you very much
