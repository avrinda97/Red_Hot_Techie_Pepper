2010-01-08T17:44:00.000Z	Baribal	erUSUL	already on it. :)
2010-01-08T17:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	Baribal	it was s*c*d0 or sr0
2010-01-08T17:41:00.000Z	Baribal	erUSUL	scd0, yes.
2010-01-08T17:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	Baribal	see dmesg output « dmesg | grep ata »
2010-01-08T17:44:00.000Z	Baribal	erUSUL	can't really make heads or tails from it, just a sec...
2010-01-08T17:49:00.000Z	Baribal	erUSUL	can't find the problem, too? ^^
2010-01-08T17:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	Baribal	how many hard disk do you have ?
2010-01-08T17:53:00.000Z	Baribal	erUSUL	two.
2010-01-08T17:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	Baribal	samsung and seagate?
2010-01-08T17:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	Baribal	ata3.01: failed to IDENTIFY (I/O error, err_mask=0x2) <<< could be this. but i dunno why t happens oe how to fix it ... mayube is a kernel bug
2010-01-08T17:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	Baribal	« dmesg | grep sr » returns anything?
2010-01-08T17:56:00.000Z	Baribal	erUSUL	more or less: http://pastebin.com/m611f89e9
2010-01-08T17:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	Baribal	i was looking at a line like this sr0: scsi3-mmc drive: 48x/48x writer cd/rw xa/form2 cdda tray
2010-01-08T17:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	Baribal	but anyway, report it as kernel bug. if the drive works in older kernels should work on a newer one
2010-01-08T17:58:00.000Z	Baribal	erUSUL	no, nothing like that, no sr0, and no /dev/sr0 either.
2010-06-24T19:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	Baribal	try scribus ?
2010-06-24T19:01:00.000Z	Baribal	erUSUL	thanks, installing now...
2010-06-24T19:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	Baribal	or inkscape http://wiki.scribus.net/index.php/Export/Import_capabilities_of_Scribus,_OpenOffice.org,_Inkscape,_GIMP,_and_Krita
2010-06-24T19:09:00.000Z	Baribal	erUSUL	Inkscape did the trick, scribus didn't. Now I have to figure out how to actually use it, but, to quote Dexter, there's always a sacrifice. :)
2010-06-24T19:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	Baribal	good luck
