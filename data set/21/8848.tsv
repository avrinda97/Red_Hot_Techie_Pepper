2008-08-17T01:22:00.000Z	psypher246		hey all, hope somone can help me, i have been seraching for a solution now for almost a week. i want to build my own custom SERVER install of ubuntu. I have gotten so far as to create a successful preseed file. the porblem is i want to have the latest updates with the install BUT not as separate packages. they should replace the onld packages making the cd image as small as possible, anyone know how to do this?
2008-08-17T01:23:00.000Z	psypher246		thanks

2008-08-17T01:25:00.000Z	psypher246	Flannel	i have been following that, NO mention of what i am asking about
2008-08-17T01:26:00.000Z	Flannel	psypher246	You need to download the updated debs, then rebuild the packages(.gz)
2008-08-17T01:27:00.000Z	Flannel	psypher246	Well, you'll be overwriting the ones in the pool, and then updating the packages.gz so it knows what the new versions are.
2008-08-17T01:27:00.000Z	Flannel	psypher246	you don't want foo v 1-3 you want foo v 1-3ubuntu4 instead.
2008-08-17T01:28:00.000Z	psypher246	Flannel	sorry i thought that just included whatever new appas you install cos u create a new repo, didn't realise this includes updates
2008-08-17T01:28:00.000Z	psypher246	Flannel	foo?
2008-08-17T01:28:00.000Z	Flannel	psypher246	Well, I'm not sure ifthere's anyway to automate the update processes of that, but you could install a fresh install, update, and then copy stuff from your apt archives (or just download everything manually from the repos)
2008-08-17T01:29:00.000Z	Flannel	psypher246	just ... random package for an example.
2008-08-17T01:30:00.000Z	psypher246	Flannel	ok i'll have a look, this truly has to be as hand free as possible, just put in cd and boot and install everything with updates and as small as possible\
2008-08-17T01:30:00.000Z	Flannel	psypher246	Right, I'm talking about doing it on *your* machine, and then grabbing the updated versions from your apt archives and putting them onto the CD image
2008-08-17T01:31:00.000Z	psypher246	Flannel	ok, but can i just replace the file in the pool with the new file?
2008-08-17T01:32:00.000Z	Flannel	psypher246	Yes, provided you rebuild the packages/packages.gz
2008-08-17T01:32:00.000Z	Flannel	psypher246	the alternate/server install CD has the preseed/etc stuff which tells it what packages to install, and then a repository on the CD, which it uses to install from.
2008-08-17T01:33:00.000Z	Flannel	psypher246	Which is also what the minimal CD does, except that it doesn't have packages on the CD, and gets them straight from the repositories online instead.
2008-08-17T01:33:00.000Z	Flannel	psypher246	which means that they're always up to date, although youre downloading per intsall
2008-08-17T01:34:00.000Z	psypher246	Flannel	is the minimal cd better to start with, all i want is an openvpn server with minimal size
2008-08-17T01:34:00.000Z	Flannel	psypher246	minimal CD is identical to the alternate CD, except it doesn't include any packages on the CD
2008-08-17T01:35:00.000Z	psypher246	Flannel	cool, i'll have another go, thank you!!!
