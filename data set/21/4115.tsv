2008-12-22T03:10:00.000Z	R0b0t1		How might I update a package (Freepascal, currently 2.2.0 in the manager) to a newer version? installing from a .deb file does not work, the package stays the same.
2008-12-22T03:11:00.000Z	Slart	R0b0t1	what version do you want to install?
2008-12-22T03:14:00.000Z	R0b0t1	Slart	2.2.2, from 2.2.0. It is impossible for me to update from the projects SVN, 2.2.0 is too old to compile the newer version ;)
2008-12-22T03:15:00.000Z	Slart	R0b0t1	the compiler is written in freepascal?
2008-12-22T03:15:00.000Z	R0b0t1	Slart	Yes, it happens to be.
2008-12-22T03:15:00.000Z	Slart	R0b0t1	and needs the latest version to compile the latest version?.. great thinking there
2008-12-22T03:16:00.000Z	R0b0t1	Slart	:S
2008-12-22T03:16:00.000Z	R0b0t1	Slart	I didn't develop it.
2008-12-22T03:16:00.000Z	Slart	R0b0t1	well.. you need to find precompiled binaries then.. ubuntu doesn't supply those for the version you want.. so I guess you need to go pester the fp developers
2010-05-14T03:00:00.000Z	Slart	R0b0t1	do you have an url to the bug report?
2010-05-14T03:01:00.000Z	R0b0t1	Slart	No... apparently, no one experiencing the problem has made one.
2010-05-14T03:02:00.000Z	Slart	R0b0t1	well.. then I think it's safe to say that no.. it hasn't been fixed =/
2010-05-14T03:06:00.000Z	Slart	R0b0t1	does this look like your problem? https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gdm/+bug/546587
2010-05-14T03:06:00.000Z	Slart	R0b0t1	although it just affects the keyboard
2010-05-14T03:07:00.000Z	R0b0t1	Slart	No, it affects my mouse as well... My mouse is USB, however, that might be part of it.
2010-05-14T03:07:00.000Z	R0b0t1	Slart	Sounds like it, but is 10.04 karmic...?
2010-05-14T03:08:00.000Z	Slart	R0b0t1	nope.. but lucid is mentioned further down.. there's also this bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gdm/+bug/577173
2010-05-14T03:08:00.000Z	Slart	R0b0t1	this might also be useful http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=9294246
2010-05-14T03:09:00.000Z	R0b0t1	Slart	Thanks. The first one looks like it's the one I'm talking about... If I can upgrade the kernel, it should work, apparently. How might I do that via SSH? Or, rather, how might I do that via command line?
2010-05-14T03:10:00.000Z	Slart	R0b0t1	if the new kernel is available from the repos you just run "sudo apt-get update" and then "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade"
2010-05-14T03:10:00.000Z	R0b0t1	Slart	That I did. It might be recent, I will try again. Thanks :)
