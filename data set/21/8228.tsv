2006-05-14T07:07:00.000Z	lutra	jksd	did you install windows first or second?
2006-05-14T07:08:00.000Z	jksd	lutra	second
2006-05-14T07:08:00.000Z	lutra	jksd	you should install windows first
2006-05-14T07:08:00.000Z	lutra	jksd	you'll need to reinstall grub
2006-05-14T07:08:00.000Z	jksd	lutra	ahh I see
2006-05-14T07:08:00.000Z	jksd	lutra	how can I do that without logging into ubuntu?>
2006-05-14T07:09:00.000Z	lutra	jksd	do you have a live cd?
2006-05-14T07:09:00.000Z	jksd	lutra	live cd?

2006-05-14T07:09:00.000Z	lutra	jksd	i think running grub-install or some similar command you can reinstall grub
2006-05-14T07:10:00.000Z	jksd	lutra	where do I run grub-install from? the live cd?
2006-05-14T07:10:00.000Z	lutra	jksd	do you know what device your linux partition is.../dev/hda1, /dev/hdc1 and so on

2006-05-14T07:10:00.000Z	jksd	lutra	I think it's /dev/hda2
2006-05-14T07:10:00.000Z	lutra	jksd	ok then 'grub-install /dev/hda2'
