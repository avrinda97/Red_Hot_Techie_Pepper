2010-01-21T06:54:00.000Z	jlca		anyone know how to disable the startup splash page?
2010-01-21T06:55:00.000Z	r6	jlca	what version of ubuntu?
2010-01-21T07:20:00.000Z	jlca	r6	I tried your suggestion but the boot screen was blank. I was not able to view services starting or not. anything else that you can think of? Thanks for your efforts.
2010-01-21T07:21:00.000Z	r6	jlca	are you passing "nosplash" alone (w/o "quiet")?
2010-01-21T07:22:00.000Z	jlca	r6	yes without quie
2010-01-21T07:26:00.000Z	jlca	r6	in grub there is a line #GRUB_TERMINAL=console  The description states to uncomment to disable graphical terninal (grub-pc only) So maybe this is it. I'll try and get back to you if you are interested.
2010-01-21T07:28:00.000Z	r6	jlca	thank you that would be good
2010-01-21T07:29:00.000Z	jlca	r6	ok i need maybe 10-15 mins if i'm lucky. if you don't here from me well ... i'm off now
2010-01-21T07:46:00.000Z	jlca	r6	ok I back with a new bag.... I was able to get it to work
2010-01-21T07:47:00.000Z	r6	jlca	did it work? what you did?
2010-01-21T07:48:00.000Z	jlca	r6	I just uncommented that line and rebooted with negative results. however I realized that you must run update-grub for the changes to take affect and that did it.
2010-01-21T07:49:00.000Z	r6	jlca	sorry i forgot to tell you that, what were the options that worked?
2010-01-21T07:50:00.000Z	jlca	r6	there were no additional options add.
2010-01-21T07:50:00.000Z	jlca	r6	it might work just adding nosplash if one ran updat-grub afterward
2010-01-21T08:01:00.000Z	jlca	r6	did it work?
2010-01-21T08:02:00.000Z	r6	jlca	i realized it'll give me a text console, but i want framebuffer console :/
2010-01-21T08:03:00.000Z	jlca	r6	 i don't know the diff
2010-01-21T08:04:00.000Z	r6	jlca	framebuffer gives you graphics mode console, you can set pseudo text resolutions higher than 80x25
2010-01-21T08:04:00.000Z	r6	jlca	very common and i been using it from years, but with latest ubuntus i couldn't anymore
2010-01-21T08:05:00.000Z	jlca	r6	ok  and thank you very much for your help. I'll be signing of in about 5 mins
2010-01-21T08:05:00.000Z	r6	jlca	ty too, g'luck
