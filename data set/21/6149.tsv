2007-05-29T06:36:00.000Z	__enigma__	dromer	when you are right clicking to make a partition, what is the error?
2007-05-29T06:36:00.000Z	dromer	__enigma__	you mean: new partition/ cntrl+n ?
2007-05-29T06:37:00.000Z	dromer	__enigma__	I need to set a disklabel .. it takes a while .. and then nothing happens
2007-05-29T06:37:00.000Z	__enigma__	dromer	yes
2007-05-29T06:37:00.000Z	dromer	__enigma__	and in the console I started gparted from it says: Unable to open /dev/sda - unrecognised disk label.
2007-05-29T06:37:00.000Z	__enigma__	dromer	how long have you waited?  You remember you are over usb right?
2007-05-29T06:38:00.000Z	dromer	__enigma__	I wait untill the screen is cleared
2007-05-29T06:38:00.000Z	__enigma__	dromer	that is interesting...
2007-05-29T06:38:00.000Z	__enigma__	dromer	sorry I cant help then... Usually when I do it over a usb it takes about ten to fifteen min
2007-05-29T06:39:00.000Z	dromer	__enigma__	depends on the size of the disk I guess, it's a  6gb disk
2007-05-29T06:39:00.000Z	dromer	__enigma__	but gparted can't read the disk label
2007-05-29T06:39:00.000Z	dromer	__enigma__	and can't set it's own disk label
2007-05-29T06:40:00.000Z	__enigma__	dromer	try to set it in fdisk to blank
2007-05-29T06:40:00.000Z	dromer	__enigma__	how do I do that?
