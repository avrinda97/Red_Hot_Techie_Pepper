2008-07-23T06:10:00.000Z	Xsss4hell		I want to stream my screen how do I do that over amsn?
2008-07-23T06:10:00.000Z	Xsss4hell		Howto setup a fake camera that streams the screen
2008-07-23T06:10:00.000Z	rockenrola1	Xsss4hell	vlc ?
2008-07-23T06:12:00.000Z	Xsss4hell	rockenrola1	I need a fake hardware device that I can select as v4l2 device
2008-07-23T06:12:00.000Z	rockenrola1	Xsss4hell	fake? you don't have a camera? then I don't know.
2008-07-23T06:13:00.000Z	Xsss4hell	rockenrola1	I have a camera, I don't want to adjust my camera to record my screen
2008-07-23T06:13:00.000Z	Xsss4hell	rockenrola1	I want to directly stream my screen
2008-07-23T06:14:00.000Z	rockenrola1	Xsss4hell	that is a interesting project. good luck
2008-07-23T06:15:00.000Z	Xsss4hell	rockenrola1	it's not a project, that's something that exists I don't know the name of the app
2008-07-23T06:18:00.000Z	rockenrola1	Xsss4hell	in a quick google it seems that vlc also does screencast. if true then the streaming comes along.
2008-07-23T06:18:00.000Z	Xsss4hell	rockenrola1	he streams to me and is surfing and photoshopping very fluid
2008-07-23T06:23:00.000Z	rockenrola1	Xsss4hell	what is your ultimate goal?
2008-07-23T06:24:00.000Z	Xsss4hell	rockenrola1	to show him my desktop and the project I'm working on with him
2008-07-23T06:24:00.000Z	Xsss4hell	rockenrola1	like vnc but over a webcam session in msn
2008-07-23T06:25:00.000Z	rockenrola1	Xsss4hell	ok. but why not vnc then? it will do the trick
2008-07-23T06:25:00.000Z	Xsss4hell	rockenrola1	but he need vnc also right?
2008-07-23T06:26:00.000Z	rockenrola1	Xsss4hell	yes. I see your problem now
2008-07-23T06:28:00.000Z	Xsss4hell	rockenrola1	it is a very simple idea. LOOPBACk from screen to another virtual v4l2 device
