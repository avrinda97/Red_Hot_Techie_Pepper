2011-02-01T04:49:00.000Z	Acid190	john38	your installing natively? have a fresh cd and clean hdd?
2011-02-01T04:50:00.000Z	john38	Acid190	i tried desktop, netbook and upgrading from 10.04
2011-02-01T04:51:00.000Z	john38	Acid190	on dvd
2011-02-01T04:51:00.000Z	Acid190	john38	I would hate to recommend a new download, but sometimes that's the case if that dvd can't install at all
2011-02-01T04:51:00.000Z	john38	Acid190	im able to install 10.04 fine
2011-02-01T04:52:00.000Z	john38	Acid190	so what i should try usb install
2011-02-01T04:52:00.000Z	Acid190	john38	10.04 is long-term support, 10.10 is not
2011-02-01T04:53:00.000Z	john38	Acid190	i'd stick with 10.04 if my built in mic worked
2011-02-01T04:55:00.000Z	Acid190	john38	so if your mic worked in 10.04 you would be happy?
2011-02-01T04:56:00.000Z	john38	Acid190	i mean hey of course
2011-02-01T04:56:00.000Z	john38	Acid190	it would be cool if it worked
2011-02-01T04:57:00.000Z	Acid190	john38	im no guru, unless someone else can help you further, I would google your mic hardware with ubuntu 10.04 and see if a configuration is available
2011-02-01T04:58:00.000Z	john38	Acid190	i dont know what kind of built in camera mic it is i know if use alc269 sound
2011-02-01T04:58:00.000Z	Acid190	john38	there may be just a hardware update for the mic once you have 10.04 installed instead of upgrading all the way to 10.10
2011-02-01T04:58:00.000Z	john38	Acid190	ok
