2008-02-25T17:01:00.000Z	bullgard4		Wikipedia says that Linux supports the SMBus. What are the tools to read out the smart battery data of my Ubuntu 7.10 computer?
2008-02-25T17:01:00.000Z	hischild	bullgard4	smart battery data as in eta till it is charged etc?
2008-02-25T17:02:00.000Z	bullgard4	hischild	I do not understand you. Could you say it in other words, please.
2008-02-25T17:02:00.000Z	hischild	bullgard4	you're asking if there are tools that read out the smart data of your battery. What kind of info are you looking for? the time untill it is charged, how long the battery would last etc?
2008-02-25T17:04:00.000Z	bullgard4	hischild	yes. And what tools are available to query the SMBus.
2008-02-25T17:05:00.000Z	hischild	bullgard4	as far as i know those things are installed by default. do you just want that information or are you trying to develop a program of sorts?
2008-02-25T17:07:00.000Z	bullgard4	hischild	I should like to obtain the primary information from SMBus devices on my computer's motherboard via SMBus and its associated tools.
2008-02-25T17:11:00.000Z	hischild	bullgard4	i'm sorry, the only package i know of this, would be battery-stats. It does collect info, but it doesn't seem to be build on a program. You might find in there what you are looking for.
2008-02-25T17:16:00.000Z	bullgard4	hischild	battery-stats is built on top of APM. APM is outdated and not enabled in my Ubuntu 7.10 computer. I will not consider it installing. A better solution is ACPI.
2008-02-25T17:19:00.000Z	hischild	bullgard4	i wasn't talking about isntalling it. but maybe that you might find some info there that might help you find what you're looking for. :-)
2008-02-25T17:23:00.000Z	bullgard4	hischild	I could analyze the source code of battery-stats. But I consider it outdated in view of the fact that all modern development in this area is based on ACPI. I believe that there should be tools available to query the SMBus devices on my motherboard.
2008-02-25T17:23:00.000Z	hischild	bullgard4	i'm looking for the one that currently tracks my battery stats ...
2008-02-25T17:26:00.000Z	hischild	bullgard4	it seems that gnome-power-manager is currently being used on my box
2008-02-25T17:30:00.000Z	bullgard4	hischild	A high-level program that provides the information you requested is the Gnome_Power_Manager applet. Right-cklick. A context menu will appear. Click on the second menu item 'Power history'.
2008-02-25T17:31:00.000Z	hischild	bullgard4	wasn't that what i said up far?
2008-02-25T17:32:00.000Z	bullgard4	hischild	Well, so much better. That seems to satisfy xour needs. But I am interested in the primary (low-level) information.
2008-03-25T09:43:00.000Z	hischild	bullgard4	AFAIK the thing you're trying to make it execute.
2008-03-25T09:43:00.000Z	bullgard4	hischild	Your answer is too abstrect for me. Can you elaborate.
2008-03-25T09:44:00.000Z	hischild	bullgard4	if you try to make it execute gedit, the modifier would be gedit afaik
2008-08-20T14:41:00.000Z	hischild	bullgard4	ActionParsnip, the ubuntu logo means it's part of the main ubuntu repo's
2008-08-20T14:42:00.000Z	bullgard4	hischild	Thank you for your information.
