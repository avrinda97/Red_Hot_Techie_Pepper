2011-04-07T23:31:00.000Z	geekbri		can anybody see an obvious reason my cron job doesn't seem to be going off?      0 */4 * * *     reporting source /etc/web/conf.d/stage2_loader_toolbar_reporting.env && /home/reporting/trunk/crons/stage3_loader_toolbar_reporting.sh 2>&1 | /usr/bin/logger -t stage3_loader_toolbar_reporting
2011-04-07T23:31:00.000Z	geekbri		im not using crontab -e im editing /etc/crontab directly
2011-04-07T23:32:00.000Z	raido	geekbri	well, you need the full path to the executable as proper crontab syntax, I also beleive that crontab dissallows pipes
2011-04-07T23:33:00.000Z	raido	geekbri	youre better off makin that a script and having cron execute the script
2011-04-07T23:33:00.000Z	geekbri	raido	yeah i was trying to avoid that but i guess i'll have to do that again.
2012-01-11T00:35:00.000Z	raido	geekbri	are you using the same keys for those machines or different keys with the same passphrase?
2012-01-11T00:35:00.000Z	geekbri	raido	Same keys, id_rsa.pub is appended to authorized_keys on the remote machine.  so the user bob is using id_rsa.  IE ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa bill@example.com
2012-01-11T00:37:00.000Z	raido	geekbri	and the same key is in the authorized_keys file for bill?
2012-01-11T00:38:00.000Z	geekbri	raido	sorry, yes that is what i was saying, the id_rsa.pub is in bills authorized_keys
2012-01-11T00:38:00.000Z	geekbri	raido	it is not in bob's authorized_keys, does it need to be there as well? I was just calling ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
2012-01-11T00:43:00.000Z	raido	geekbri	no, not unless you logging in as bob. However, bill must be allowed to log in remotely. Are you sure bill has remote login permission via ssh?
2012-01-11T00:44:00.000Z	geekbri	raido	he does, i actually just tested the setup on my machien and it works fine, but another user is trying to do the same thing but it prompts him for his passphrase everytime even they he added it with ssh-add
2012-01-11T00:46:00.000Z	raido	geekbri	so your all fine but from another machine and another user (mary) tries to ssh-add her private key and passphrase and cant log into bill@example?
2012-01-11T00:46:00.000Z	geekbri	raido	they can login, but even after cacheing it with ssh-agent / ssh-add it still prompts them for their keys passphrase when it shouldn't be
2012-01-11T00:48:00.000Z	raido	geekbri	make sure they arent using multiple private keys in ~.ssh. ssh-agent only loads the defaults
2012-01-11T00:49:00.000Z	geekbri	raido	i'll check, who knows what craziness they did :)
2012-01-11T00:49:00.000Z	raido	geekbri	they can use more than one but then ssh-agent needs to be told
2012-01-11T00:50:00.000Z	raido	geekbri	FWIW, all my keys are passphraseless. I find that much easier to handle.
2012-01-11T01:01:00.000Z	geekbri	raido	passphraseless is certainly more convenient but unfortunately not as secure if somehow the key is obtained by people that shouldn't have it :(
2012-01-11T01:02:00.000Z	raido	geekbri	indeed. but, sysadmin is a fraught with comprimise. One must pick his battles.
2012-01-11T01:02:00.000Z	geekbri	raido	ah truer words have never been spoken
