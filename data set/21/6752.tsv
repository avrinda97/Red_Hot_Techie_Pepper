2010-10-25T03:34:00.000Z	Tom1		Ubuntu 10.10 does not appear on my boot menu after upgrade...does anyone have any ideas please? thanks
2010-10-25T03:34:00.000Z	coz_	Tom1	 you mean the grub menu  .. yes?
2010-10-25T03:35:00.000Z	coz_	Tom1	 you are choosing the top most entry on the list   yes?
2010-10-25T03:35:00.000Z	coz_	Tom1	 ok  and it wont boot... just it just sit there...or does text  show at all ....?
2010-10-25T03:36:00.000Z	coz_	Tom1	 if there is a grub issue  I have not seen it
2010-10-25T03:37:00.000Z	coz_	Tom1	 well there is a way to reinstall grub2
2010-10-25T03:37:00.000Z	coz_	Tom1	 let me get the link  hold on
2010-10-25T03:37:00.000Z	coz_	Tom1	   http://grub.enbug.org/Grub2LiveCdInstallGuide
2010-10-25T03:38:00.000Z	coz_	Tom1	 if you try that..please read through it a few times to become familiar with it
2010-10-25T03:39:00.000Z	Tom1	coz_	I think I tried a procedure very similar to that already but the grub menu didn't change upon restart
2010-10-25T03:39:00.000Z	coz_	Tom1	 then the install may have failed at some point....did you check the cd for errors?
2010-10-25T03:40:00.000Z	coz_	Tom1	 yes   it probably  partitioned the drive and install ubuntu but apparenlty  the install is a bit broken
2010-10-25T03:41:00.000Z	coz_	Tom1	  y ou can simply overwrite the current install with a fesh install BUT   when you boot into the live cd...you sould see a keyboard logo at the bottom of the screen.. when you see that,,hit enter to get to a menu  ...there you want to check the cd for errors or  check file system   however it is worded
2010-10-25T03:42:00.000Z	Tom1	coz_	okay, i will double-check the disk for errors thank you
2010-10-25T03:42:00.000Z	coz_	Tom1	 if it has errors let someone here know... if I am not here there are many who can tell you how to check the iso image  when you re download it before you burn it
2010-10-25T03:43:00.000Z	coz_	Tom1	  then of course you want to run that check file integrity option before you install it
2010-10-25T03:45:00.000Z	Tom1	coz_	I am checking the disk for errors now
2010-10-25T03:47:00.000Z	Tom1	coz_	no errors were found on the installation disk...so hopefully the installation isn't the problem?
2010-10-25T03:48:00.000Z	coz_	Tom1	  which video card is on the system?
2010-10-25T03:48:00.000Z	coz_	Tom1	 then I am puzzled  for sure
2010-10-25T03:49:00.000Z	Tom1	coz_	is it logical to think both operation systems are still there? just not being accessed correctly?
