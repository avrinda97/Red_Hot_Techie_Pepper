2007-06-27T06:29:00.000Z	WaxyFresh		i extracted a amd64 alternative install from an iso to a usb drive and then started my computer,all i get is os not found
2007-06-27T06:30:00.000Z	WaxyFresh		is there something im misssing?^^
2007-06-27T06:30:00.000Z	ekimus	WaxyFresh	probably a boot record
2007-06-27T06:30:00.000Z	WaxyFresh	ekimus	how would i add a boot record?
2007-06-27T06:31:00.000Z	WaxyFresh	ekimus	i basicly want teh usb drive to work lke a cd drive causeing the computer to boot into the install cd i extracted on it
2007-06-27T06:32:00.000Z	ekimus	WaxyFresh	why don't you just install ubuntu on the usb drive?
2007-06-27T06:32:00.000Z	ekimus	WaxyFresh	it does boot fine? so then forget that boot record problem
2007-06-27T06:33:00.000Z	WaxyFresh	ekimus	no that was in reference to an earlier Q
2007-06-27T06:33:00.000Z	ekimus	WaxyFresh	do you need 64bit? (messy setup with flash and a whole bunch of other drivers) if you don't have a specific reason to use 64bit stay 32bit
2007-06-27T06:34:00.000Z	WaxyFresh	ekimus	isnt 64 bit faster though?
2007-06-27T06:34:00.000Z	ekimus	WaxyFresh	no
2007-06-27T06:34:00.000Z	WaxyFresh	ekimus	what would the benefits be?
2007-06-27T06:35:00.000Z	ekimus	WaxyFresh	64bit just enables you to get past certain limitations (ram size, etc) but I'm pretty sure you won't hit these as a normal PC user
2007-06-27T06:36:00.000Z	ekimus	WaxyFresh	64bit is an advantage when doing vast amounts of number crunching or similiar stuff in all other cases (desktop systems) it just causes problems cause of missing drivers
2007-06-27T06:36:00.000Z	WaxyFresh	ekimus	so the 1400$ laptop my friend got was a silly investment?
2007-06-27T06:38:00.000Z	ekimus	WaxyFresh	in my opinion 64bit is useless for a home user (or better stated, the people that sell you 64bit aren't willing to support 64bit - since all the 32bit software still works on that hardware they still sell 32bit software to run on 64bit hardware)
2007-06-27T06:38:00.000Z	WaxyFresh	ekimus	thanks
2007-06-27T06:39:00.000Z	ekimus	WaxyFresh	besides that are all the components 64bit? i know that there are a couple of boxes out there that have the ultra lates super cool 64bit processors - which is running in 32bit mode because all the other peripherals (chipset on the motherboard etc) are only 32bit capable
2007-06-27T06:41:00.000Z	ekimus	WaxyFresh	so back on topic :) - simply try installing the 32bit cdrom on your usb drive (the real install procedure not live cd extracting) and try to get that working. it will run on every computer (which makes sense for a portable drive, think of the case where you are happily carring around your install and come to a 32bit box and you chose to install 64bit)
2007-06-27T06:41:00.000Z	WaxyFresh	ekimus	i dont know amd turiom 64 X2 duel core  ati radeon Xpres 1150 2 gigs memory (would that card run beryl you think?)besides thAT I DONT KNOW ANYTING ABOUT THE HARDWARE
2007-06-27T06:42:00.000Z	ekimus	WaxyFresh	np, but i can assure you that the ubuntu 32bit cdrom will run and install on 64bit hardware (given the hardware is supported but you'd have to have some real exotics to find unsupported hardware imho)
