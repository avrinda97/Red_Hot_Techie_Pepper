2007-06-29T08:48:00.000Z	dn4		Is there a reason why my ubuntu box is getting a huge circle over kentuky with this website: http://radar.weather.gov/ridge/Conus/full.php
2007-06-29T08:49:00.000Z	jacktheripper	dn4	that is what is on the web, its the server not the client
2007-06-29T08:50:00.000Z	dn4	jacktheripper	:) interesting
2007-06-29T08:50:00.000Z	jacktheripper	dn4	apparently the radar there is on the fritz....
2007-06-29T08:50:00.000Z	jacktheripper	dn4	because it isnt raining outside :)
2007-06-29T08:51:00.000Z	dn4	jacktheripper	wonder what causes that type of output hmm
