2008-01-12T06:46:00.000Z	madrazr		Hii all
2008-01-12T06:48:00.000Z	madrazr		Hii all, we have an idea of writing a new tool which is related to apt system, we want to know whether something of that sort already exists
2008-01-12T06:48:00.000Z	madrazr		where can we ask about this??
2008-01-12T06:49:00.000Z	madrazr		can someone answer here ??
2008-01-12T06:49:00.000Z	nickrud	madrazr	debian-devel mail list
2008-01-12T06:49:00.000Z	madrazr	nickrud	if we do it on Debian-Debian devel list how fast can we see it in Ubuntu's repo??
2008-01-12T06:50:00.000Z	nickrud	madrazr	probably a long time. If you want to talk to ubuntu devs, start in #ubuntu-motu
2008-01-12T06:51:00.000Z	madrazr	nickrud	Oh ok thanks for that
2008-03-14T08:23:00.000Z	nickrud	madrazr	are you sure your isp lets stuff in on port 80?
2008-03-14T08:26:00.000Z	madrazr	nickrud	when one of my friend tries http://IP-adress it works for him
2008-03-14T08:26:00.000Z	nickrud	madrazr	same provider?
2008-03-14T08:26:00.000Z	madrazr	nickrud	ya same ISP
2008-03-14T08:26:00.000Z	madrazr	nickrud	but different routers
2008-03-14T08:27:00.000Z	nickrud	madrazr	could be your router, can you connect at 127.0.0.1 ?
2008-03-14T08:27:00.000Z	madrazr	nickrud	I have setup virtual hosts in my system, could that be a problem
2008-03-14T08:28:00.000Z	madrazr	nickrud	also my localhost is pointing to a directory in home and not to /var/www
2008-03-14T08:28:00.000Z	madrazr	nickrud	when I type http://my ip adress in the browser it will redirect to my 192,168.1.1 page, i.e my modem setup page
2008-03-14T08:28:00.000Z	nickrud	madrazr	I'd suggest trying a really simple apache config , make sure that's not the issue. But I'm no apache whiz
2008-03-14T08:29:00.000Z	madrazr	nickrud	ok
2008-03-14T08:29:00.000Z	nickrud	madrazr	you have set stuff up strangely then. 127.0.0.1 should be localhost by definition
2008-03-14T08:29:00.000Z	nickrud	madrazr	ah, nm misunderstood what you typed up above
