2004-10-13T07:03:00.000Z	subterrific		yeah, IE is much better for getting exploits
2004-10-13T07:03:00.000Z	DimSum	subterrific	Sure, if you don't patch
2004-10-13T07:04:00.000Z	DimSum	subterrific	Where'd you get that idea from?
2004-10-13T07:05:00.000Z	subterrific	DimSum	you don't check the logs?
2004-10-13T07:06:00.000Z	subterrific	DimSum	lets see this amazing website
2004-10-13T07:08:00.000Z	subterrific	DimSum	ghecko doesn't, IE does
2004-10-13T07:08:00.000Z	DimSum	subterrific	My site looks fine in IE, thanks.
2004-10-13T07:20:00.000Z	DimSum	subterrific	Yep.
2004-10-13T07:20:00.000Z	DimSum	subterrific	Sure, "broken" IE.
2004-10-13T07:21:00.000Z	subterrific	DimSum	yes, it renders valid CSS with zero logic
2004-10-13T07:21:00.000Z	DimSum	subterrific	IE renders CSS perfectly, thanks.
2004-10-13T07:23:00.000Z	DimSum	subterrific	Thank god.
2004-10-13T07:26:00.000Z	subterrific	DimSum	ctrl-tab gives only browser tabs which is more efficient than alt-tab which gives you a list of every single window for every app
2004-10-13T07:27:00.000Z	DimSum	subterrific	I like that choice
2004-10-13T07:28:00.000Z	subterrific	DimSum	you just said you did, you use alt-tab to switch browser windows
2004-10-13T07:28:00.000Z	DimSum	subterrific	Exactly.
2004-10-13T07:32:00.000Z	subterrific	DimSum	so you think IE renders CSS 100% perfectly and you ignore the example i give you of IE not rendering valid CSS correctly and requiring insane work arounds.
2004-10-13T07:32:00.000Z	DimSum	subterrific	!care.
2004-10-13T07:33:00.000Z	subterrific	DimSum	then you complain about tabbed browsing because you can't switch tabs with a keystroke, and refuse to use ctrl-tab and say you'd rather switch through a list of every window to get to whatever browser window you're looking for. all along ignoring the fact that firefox doesn't force tabbed browsing on you
2004-10-13T07:33:00.000Z	DimSum	subterrific	Like I said, I dislike FireFox.
2004-10-13T07:33:00.000Z	subterrific	DimSum	you're text book fanatic. ignore all logic.
