2005-01-29T16:20:00.000Z	ideafix		is it true that this distro has no firewall ?
2005-01-29T16:20:00.000Z	jdub	ideafix	yes. it doesn't need one.
2005-01-29T16:21:00.000Z	jdub	ideafix	there are no listening ports by default, so if you add other services, you know what you're doing
2005-01-29T16:21:00.000Z	jdub	ideafix	there are firewall packages around, however
2005-01-29T16:22:00.000Z	jdub	ideafix	ah, we just said there are no listening ports by default
2005-01-29T16:22:00.000Z	jdub	ideafix	that's an explicit policy goal
2005-01-29T16:29:00.000Z	jdub	ideafix	"hacker" means a different thing in the open source world
2005-01-29T16:35:00.000Z	jdub	ideafix	cracking
2005-01-29T16:36:00.000Z	jdub	ideafix	the packet filtering code is in the kernel
2005-01-29T16:36:00.000Z	jdub	ideafix	you don't run a firewall 'as root'
2005-01-29T16:37:00.000Z	jdub	ideafix	that's the gui
2005-01-29T16:44:00.000Z	jdub	ideafix	yes, it's a branch of sid
2005-01-29T16:45:00.000Z	jdub	ideafix	no, we have freezes and bugfixing periods before our six monthly stable releases
2005-01-29T16:47:00.000Z	jdub	ideafix	yes, of course
2005-01-29T16:49:00.000Z	jdub	ideafix	that's a pretty ridiculous question, dude.
2005-01-29T16:55:00.000Z	jdub	ideafix	keep it polite, please.
2005-01-29T16:59:00.000Z	jdub	ideafix	no
2005-01-30T17:01:00.000Z	jdub	ideafix	not really, no
2005-01-30T17:14:00.000Z	ideafix	jdub	 #ubuntu-pt
2005-02-22T06:00:00.000Z	jdub	ideafix	because it's really very good
2005-02-22T06:04:00.000Z	jdub	ideafix	then watch out for Kubuntu
