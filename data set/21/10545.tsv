2005-04-11T13:17:00.000Z	Dreamer3		anyone with any idea how to set gtk1 fonts?
2005-04-11T13:18:00.000Z	delire	Dreamer3	fontconfig?
2005-04-11T13:20:00.000Z	Dreamer3	delire	man fontconfig gives me nothing
2005-04-11T13:20:00.000Z	delire	Dreamer3	you have it installed?
2005-04-11T13:21:00.000Z	delire	Dreamer3	there are others.. what specifically do you want to do?
2005-04-11T13:22:00.000Z	Dreamer3	delire	well... now i have the gtk2 version of sylpheed open... and bold text( for some reason) appears larger than non-bold text
2005-04-11T13:23:00.000Z	Dreamer3	delire	it's really kind of weird... in the gtk1 version the bold fonts were smaller, and the only ones that looked good, now it's the opposite
2005-04-11T13:23:00.000Z	delire	Dreamer3	hmm.. are you using gnome/kde?
2005-04-11T13:23:00.000Z	Dreamer3	delire	gnome
2005-04-11T13:24:00.000Z	delire	Dreamer3	to select fonts use gtkfontsel
2005-04-11T13:25:00.000Z	Dreamer3	delire	installing
2005-04-11T13:25:00.000Z	Dreamer3	delire	hmmm
2005-04-11T13:26:00.000Z	delire	Dreamer3	and then to ensure they are used and how they are configured see whether you have a /home/Dreamer3/.gtkrc directory
2005-04-11T13:26:00.000Z	Dreamer3	delire	does this change anything or just show me my fonts?
2005-04-11T13:27:00.000Z	Dreamer3	delire	nope, no .gtkrc
2005-04-11T13:28:00.000Z	delire	Dreamer3	you can make one with 'touch ~/.gtkrc and then edit it to include lines like "font = "-B&H-Lucida-Medium-R-Normal-Sans-11-80-100-100-P-63-ISO8859-1""
2005-04-11T13:29:00.000Z	Dreamer3	delire	whoa :)
2005-04-11T13:29:00.000Z	Dreamer3	delire	guess i'm just going to have to boot DSL and look around
2005-04-11T13:30:00.000Z	delire	Dreamer3	i'm sure gnome has a gtk font configurator. also see if sylpheed has a font configuration entry. perhaps in ~/.sylpheed
2005-04-11T13:30:00.000Z	delire	Dreamer3	or similar
