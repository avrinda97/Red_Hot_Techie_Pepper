2007-02-16T10:36:00.000Z	sebrock		shit
2007-02-16T10:37:00.000Z	sebrock		sorry, I just realized I missed a thing and did not log
2007-02-16T10:39:00.000Z	sebrock		I'm having the old Azureus problem... installed Sun Java 6 to no avail.. any hints on this?
2007-02-16T10:39:00.000Z	Flash13	sebrock	does Azureus load?
2007-02-16T10:41:00.000Z	sebrock	Flash13	I get the error message that a lot of people seems to get, I start loading and then fails
2007-02-16T10:42:00.000Z	sebrock	Flash13	check this: http://www.pastebin.ca/359196
2007-02-16T10:43:00.000Z	Flash13	sebrock	best guess if you were told it was a java issue, and you've installed java, Azureus isn't using it
2007-02-16T10:44:00.000Z	Flash13	sebrock	most likely a symlink problem
2007-02-16T10:45:00.000Z	sebrock	Flash13	well, I also have the java that comes bundled with Ubuntu Edgy
2007-02-16T10:45:00.000Z	sebrock	Flash13	ok any idea how to fix it?
2007-02-16T10:47:00.000Z	Flash13	sebrock	yes and no, I normally fix it in the Azureus lauch script, but I can't recall and don't have it to hand, so if you're confident at pointing the reference in there to your Sun Java install, go with that
2007-02-16T10:50:00.000Z	sebrock	Flash13	sorry I dont understand what I need to do?
2007-02-16T10:54:00.000Z	Flash13	sebrock	it's hard to explain, I've not done it in some time, but you need to change the symlink for java or edit the Azureus launch scipt and put a direct link to your sun java
2007-02-16T10:55:00.000Z	sebrock	Flash13	ok, is there a quick command to test it with Sun Java straight away before editing something?
2007-02-16T10:55:00.000Z	Flash13	sebrock	what do you get when you do java -v? (might be -version, thinking about it)
2007-02-16T10:56:00.000Z	sebrock	Flash13	that shows the Sun Java
2007-02-16T10:58:00.000Z	Flash13	sebrock	well, your java IS installed then, you can always back up the original Azureus file before you edit it :)
2007-02-16T10:59:00.000Z	sebrock	Flash13	yes it is, problem is I still get that error message and azureus wont start
2007-02-16T11:01:00.000Z	Flash13	sebrock	yeah, just because java is installed, doesn't mean Azureus knows which one to use XD It's fickle like that
2007-02-16T11:03:00.000Z	sebrock	Flash13	I guess, thats why I ask if I could force it to be loaded by Sun Java with a command?
2007-02-16T12:08:00.000Z	sebrock	Flash13	I fixed the Azureus problem... looks like the repository package in Ubuntu is broken... I just downloaded the package from sourceforge instead
