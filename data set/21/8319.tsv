2006-04-28T13:33:00.000Z	tr0nic		i've tried mounting a windows disk (hda1) by using sudo mount /dev/hda1 /mnt/windows -t ntfs -o umask=0222 and i get device is already mounted or busy any help here is there a simple way to mount an ntfs disk
2006-04-28T13:34:00.000Z	kingspawn	tr0nic	well, IS it already mounted?
2006-04-28T13:34:00.000Z	kingspawn	tr0nic	doesnt show if you type just mount either?
2006-04-28T13:35:00.000Z	kingspawn	tr0nic	yes, but i am asking for just "mount"
2006-04-28T13:35:00.000Z	kingspawn	tr0nic	no, "mount".
2006-04-28T13:36:00.000Z	kingspawn	tr0nic	...
2006-04-28T13:36:00.000Z	kingspawn	tr0nic	just type mount.
2006-04-28T13:36:00.000Z	kingspawn	tr0nic	I am nearing retirement age here, just type "sudo mount" and hit your "ENTER" key.
2006-04-28T13:37:00.000Z	kingspawn	tr0nic	you're not in ubuntu now?
2006-04-28T13:37:00.000Z	kingspawn	tr0nic	then wait 2 secs
2006-04-28T13:38:00.000Z	kingspawn	tr0nic	If hda1 does not show up when you type "mount", try typing "sudo fdisk -l /dev/hda" too, to be sure that your hda1 is the ntfs partition
2006-04-28T13:38:00.000Z	kingspawn	tr0nic	without arguments, it just shows you every mount point in use. its just to be certain its not mounted somewhere else
2006-04-28T13:39:00.000Z	kingspawn	tr0nic	No, and stay in ubuntu when you come here next time, will make this so much easier :)
2006-04-28T13:40:00.000Z	kingspawn	tr0nic	No, but arent you trying to mount an ntfs disk? By that, I take it that you have ubuntu up and running
2006-04-28T13:41:00.000Z	kingspawn	tr0nic	What will mounting an ntfs disk help you connect to the internet?
2006-04-28T13:50:00.000Z	tr0nic	kingspawn	you still there?
2006-04-28T13:51:00.000Z	kingspawn	tr0nic	Yes. When you fdisk -l /dev/hda, does it show hda1 as ntfs, or does it just say hda?
2006-04-28T13:51:00.000Z	kingspawn	tr0nic	Well, if you have to reboot all the time, you best be sure to note down what info you need for coming back here.
2006-04-28T13:56:00.000Z	kingspawn	tr0nic	I have no idea what he said
2006-04-28T13:56:00.000Z	kingspawn	tr0nic	As far as I can see, the command you have been issuing is correct
2006-04-28T13:57:00.000Z	kingspawn	tr0nic	mount -t ntfs -o umask=0222 /dev/hda1 /mount/whatever
