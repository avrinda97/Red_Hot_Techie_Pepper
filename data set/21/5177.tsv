2008-05-19T15:32:00.000Z	perfector		can i lock my screen without the screensaver??
2008-05-19T15:33:00.000Z	perfector		most of these screensavers consume a lot of cpu resources...... thats the reason i asked..
2008-05-19T15:34:00.000Z	dougsko	perfector	you can always nice the screensaver -19
2008-05-19T15:36:00.000Z	perfector	dougsko	i didnt get what u meant? like what wud the entire command be..
2008-05-19T15:37:00.000Z	dougsko	perfector	nice -19 <screensaver>
2008-05-19T15:37:00.000Z	perfector	dougsko	example when i use xscreensaver or xlock??
2008-05-19T15:37:00.000Z	dougsko	perfector	nice -19 xlock
2008-05-19T15:37:00.000Z	perfector	dougsko	so it wont run the screensaver??
2008-05-19T15:37:00.000Z	perfector	dougsko	oh it just drops the priority u mean??
2008-05-19T15:38:00.000Z	perfector	dougsko	so everytime i launch the screensaver i have to do it..
2008-05-19T15:38:00.000Z	dougsko	perfector	itll run it but with the lowest possible cpu priority. that way, itll minimally impact anything else youre doing
2008-05-19T15:38:00.000Z	perfector	dougsko	not very efficient dont u think??
2008-05-19T15:39:00.000Z	perfector	dougsko	isnt any other way to do it using xlock or xscreensaver or anything else?
2008-05-19T15:39:00.000Z	dougsko	perfector	its quite efficient, just alias it in your .bashrc like this --> alias xlock='nice -19 xlock'
2008-05-19T15:40:00.000Z	perfector	dougsko	hmmm... worth a try.. actually i was planning to bind it to my fluxbox keys or load the app during startup
2008-05-19T15:40:00.000Z	dougsko	perfector	i was just gonna say that
2008-05-19T15:41:00.000Z	perfector	dougsko	the best way would be if either of these screen locking apps have an option like that inbuilt.. but i cant seem to find it
2008-05-19T15:42:00.000Z	dougsko	perfector	thats not the unix way :) one great app for one task. 'nice' does scheduling, and xlock locks up the screen
2008-05-19T15:43:00.000Z	perfector	dougsko	how true.. i was actually looking in a different direction.. if i cant get it that way then i guess using nice would be the only option
2008-05-19T15:45:00.000Z	dougsko	perfector	take advantage of the aliasing too. its one of the biggest time saving things you can do
2008-05-19T15:45:00.000Z	perfector	dougsko	i do that often... thx dougsko
