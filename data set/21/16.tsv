2005-01-29T08:14:00.000Z	jdub	cioppi	hmm, have you tried the speedtouch package?
2005-01-29T08:14:00.000Z	cioppi		er.... no :-D
2005-01-29T08:14:00.000Z	jdub		that's a user space driver - no kernel problems, etc.
2005-01-29T08:15:00.000Z	cioppi		I haven't yet ubuntu, jdub
2005-01-29T08:15:00.000Z	jdub	cioppi	there is also the speedtch kernel driver, but i'm not sure which one is better
2005-01-29T08:15:00.000Z	cioppi	jdub	i'm waiting for installing ubuntu before i'm sure that this support my modem :)
2005-01-29T08:17:00.000Z	jdub	cioppi	http://www.google.com/search?q=ubuntu+speedtouch -> comes up with quite a bit
2005-01-29T08:17:00.000Z	cioppi		oh, yes, thx jdub :)
2005-01-29T08:17:00.000Z	jdub	cioppi	but ignore the ones that say you should install speedtouch from tarballs - it's all in ubuntu packages :)
