2009-05-21T08:34:00.000Z	phoenixz		Who is in charge of the bots here?
2009-05-21T08:35:00.000Z	Madpilot	phoenixz	a number of people have different levels of access - found a bug?
2009-05-21T08:35:00.000Z	phoenixz	Madpilot	actually.. I'd like to propose somehting.. add http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1130582&highlight=Intel to !intel
2009-05-21T08:36:00.000Z	phoenixz	Madpilot	you got bot control? thing is, that page has quite some good info on the intel GPU problem of 9.04
2009-05-21T08:36:00.000Z	phoenixz	Madpilot	what arand says..
2009-05-21T08:37:00.000Z	Madpilot	phoenixz	I can create and edit !tells, at least
2009-05-21T08:37:00.000Z	phoenixz	Madpilot	in that case, could you add an !intel maybe? I've seen like 5 people in 5 minutes with intel driver problems
2009-05-21T08:38:00.000Z	Madpilot	phoenixz	I've heard it's a known issue for 9.04 - I've finally got a fully supported ATI myself. I'll start an !intel one
2009-05-21T08:38:00.000Z	phoenixz	Madpilot	well, i think !intel would be a bit easier, nobody is going to guess !intelregressions or something like that.. :)
2009-05-21T08:39:00.000Z	Madpilot	phoenixz	easy enough to alias tells together, for anyone who guesses !intelregressions :)
2009-05-21T08:39:00.000Z	phoenixz	Madpilot	ah, it would work with alias?
2009-05-21T08:40:00.000Z	phoenixz	Madpilot	I mean.. you can <tab> it to the entire name?
2009-05-21T08:40:00.000Z	Madpilot	phoenixz	no, no tab complete for bot tells, sorry
2009-05-21T08:41:00.000Z	phoenixz	Madpilot	then it would be a bit hard, don't you think? anyway, you're the tells boss, not me, Im just tellings whats betters.. :)
2009-05-21T08:42:00.000Z	phoenixz	Madpilot	wohoo! :)
2009-05-21T08:43:00.000Z	phoenixz	Madpilot	My first tells! more or less..
2009-05-21T08:44:00.000Z	Madpilot	phoenixz	after having issues with ATI cards on and off in previous Ubuntu releases, I'm just somewhat amused that my card works perfectly with Free drivers now, and Intel users have issues...
2009-05-21T08:45:00.000Z	phoenixz	Madpilot	its just intel who in a mood of critical insanety decided to remove that which works for this which is better, but doesn't work yet..
2009-05-21T08:46:00.000Z	phoenixz	Madpilot	actually, if you ask me, you even might add a notion about this problem in the welcome messages of the channel..
2009-05-21T08:48:00.000Z	Madpilot	phoenixz	not sure it's so widespread as to require adding to /topic or the welcome message, really. the new tell will help a lot, though.
2009-05-21T08:49:00.000Z	phoenixz	Madpilot	it will! At least we have something to quickly refer to..
