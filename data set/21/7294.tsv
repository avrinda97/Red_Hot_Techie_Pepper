2008-03-30T11:31:00.000Z	StevenX		I have a question about the partition part of installing Ubuntu. When I am choosing how big the new partition will be, am I choosing how big the partition for linux will be, or how big the partition for windows will be?
2008-03-30T11:32:00.000Z	StevenX		For example, if I have 200 gig hdd, and I tell the program that the new partition should be 150 gigs, then is that 150 for windows and 50 for ubuntu, or the other way around?
2008-03-30T11:32:00.000Z	Svenstaro	StevenX	the one for ubuntu you choose
2008-03-30T11:32:00.000Z	StevenX	Svenstaro	thanks so much. I want to make Ubuntu 10 gigs
2008-03-30T11:32:00.000Z	Svenstaro	StevenX	you can easily make it out by the partition types: windows is NTFS, ubuntu is EXT3
2008-03-30T11:33:00.000Z	StevenX	Svenstaro	ubuntu installer.
2008-03-30T11:34:00.000Z	Svenstaro	StevenX	if you want real complex partitions and full control, you should use the gparted live cd
2008-03-30T11:35:00.000Z	StevenX	Svenstaro	it wont' let me chose less than 50% of the hdd for the ubuntu partition.
2008-03-30T11:37:00.000Z	StevenX	Svenstaro	thank you.
2008-03-30T11:37:00.000Z	StevenX	Svenstaro	which kind of file system would you recommend i use for the ubnut partition?
2008-03-30T11:37:00.000Z	StevenX	Svenstaro	yes, I am using the livecd
2008-03-30T11:39:00.000Z	StevenX	Svenstaro	I started up an applicationc called partition manager.
2008-03-30T11:39:00.000Z	Svenstaro	StevenX	yeah its that one
2008-03-30T11:40:00.000Z	StevenX	Svenstaro	very intuitive. i like
2008-03-30T11:49:00.000Z	StevenX	Svenstaro	when I choose the ext3 partition in the ubuntu installer, it says that I have not root file system defined. How can I fix this?
2008-03-30T11:52:00.000Z	StevenX	Svenstaro	& DistroJockey, thanks.
2008-03-30T11:52:00.000Z	StevenX	Svenstaro	do I need to set a swamp partition? I have 3 gigs of RAM, so is it necessary?
2008-03-30T11:53:00.000Z	Svenstaro	StevenX	if you do really heavy stuff you need a swap partition, or linux instantly crashes when you run outta ram
2008-03-30T11:54:00.000Z	StevenX	Svenstaro	 guess it doesn't hurt to do it. How big would you recommend?
2008-03-30T11:54:00.000Z	StevenX	Svenstaro	for the swap alone?
2008-03-30T12:02:00.000Z	StevenX	Svenstaro	& DistroJockey, I am installing now. Thank you for all the help.
