2010-09-17T01:49:00.000Z	wieshka		hey there - quick question ... i am now making my hdds for RAID 1 array from ubuntu live cd
2010-09-17T01:49:00.000Z	wieshka		with gparted & mdadm
2010-09-17T01:49:00.000Z	wieshka		i have to pslit /boot partition out of array
2010-09-17T01:49:00.000Z	wieshka		or ubuntu & grub 2 will recognize it ?
2010-09-17T01:50:00.000Z	Emanon	wieshka	/boot must be separate
2010-09-17T01:51:00.000Z	wieshka	Emanon	so i need to create /boot on sda only or on sdb also ?
2010-09-17T01:52:00.000Z	wieshka	Emanon	really switch to alt install just for RAID1?
2010-09-17T01:52:00.000Z	Emanon	wieshka	thats how i do it
2010-09-17T01:52:00.000Z	Emanon	wieshka	on a lil 500g R1 myself
2010-09-17T01:52:00.000Z	wieshka	Emanon	i am worng ?
2010-09-17T01:53:00.000Z	wieshka	Emanon	lets make summary ....
2010-09-17T01:56:00.000Z	Emanon	wieshka	its fairly simple if you're used to cli installs it should be a breeze
2010-09-17T01:56:00.000Z	wieshka	Emanon	i prefer debian for servers - and debian has very nice graphical install for server version, but cli basicly is the same
2010-09-17T01:59:00.000Z	wieshka	Emanon	aha :)
2010-09-17T01:59:00.000Z	Emanon	wieshka	or you can do what i did dont make swap partition just make swap file
2010-09-17T01:59:00.000Z	wieshka	Emanon	also the solution
2010-09-17T01:59:00.000Z	wieshka	Emanon	isnt swap as file  performance hit ?
2010-09-17T02:07:00.000Z	wieshka	Emanon	hmmm - then ubuntu-10.04.1-alternate-amd64.iso is that what i have to install ?
2010-09-17T02:14:00.000Z	wieshka	Emanon	why extend if you can just mount it
2010-09-17T02:15:00.000Z	Emanon	wieshka	cause i like continuous filesystems not multiple
2010-09-17T02:15:00.000Z	wieshka	Emanon	isnt extending only for LVM enabled partitions ?
