2012-09-02T00:40:00.000Z	ryao		ripowen32: What is it that youa re trying to do?
2012-09-02T00:42:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ryao	if you're going to use qemu, you may as well use KVM ;-)
2012-09-02T00:42:00.000Z	ryao	gordonjcp	I am.
2012-09-02T00:43:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ryao	have you looked at ubuntu-vm-builder yet?
2012-09-02T00:43:00.000Z	ryao	gordonjcp	No.
2012-09-02T00:54:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ryao	that's basically what ubuntu-vm-builder does
2012-09-02T00:55:00.000Z	ryao	gordonjcp	It doesn't appear that ubuntu-vm-builder is available on Gentoo.
2012-09-02T00:56:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ryao	o_O
2012-09-02T00:56:00.000Z	ryao	gordonjcp	That is my host OS.
2012-09-02T00:58:00.000Z	ryao	gordonjcp	My homework is develop part of an operating system.
2012-09-02T00:58:00.000Z	ryao	gordonjcp	This is kernel programming. The build system depends on Ubuntu.
2012-09-02T00:58:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ryao	o_O
2012-09-02T00:58:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ryao	can you take it to #ubuntu-offtopic please?
2012-09-02T00:59:00.000Z	ryao	gordonjcp	Thanks, but I already know what I need to know. There is no easy way to install Ubuntu. :/
2012-09-02T00:59:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ryao	you probably don't need to
2012-09-02T01:00:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ryao	there's also an incredibly easy way to do what you want, and that's just boot into a live environment off a USB stick ;-)
2012-09-02T01:00:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ryao	furthermore, there's no practical difference between Gentoo and Ubuntu
2012-09-02T01:00:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ryao	they're both Linux
2012-09-02T01:01:00.000Z	ryao	gordonjcp	I'll try using a chroot and see how that goes.
2012-09-02T01:01:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ryao	I doubt you even need to go as complex as that
2012-09-02T01:02:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ryao	but #ubuntu-offtopic is a more appropriate place to discuss it, and you've piqued my interest now
