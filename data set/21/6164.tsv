2008-03-19T19:25:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	janerik	you have xp pro on the second partition?
2008-03-19T19:25:00.000Z	janerik	Jack_Sparrow	The only thing I know that it worked fine a month ago:-)
2008-03-19T19:27:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	janerik	What is the exact problem...  please write it all on oneline
2008-03-19T19:28:00.000Z	janerik	Jack_Sparrow	The problem is the grub menu loadss, whern it loads I cant choose options. Like if I want to boot on ubuntu or windows. The marker don't move when I hit th arrow keys. I do not know if it has the same problem, but when I try to access the win disk from ubuntu I get this error: hal-storage-fixed-mount-all-options refused uid 1000
2008-03-19T19:31:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	janerik	interesting..  so the options are correct, it just wont let you chose any of them
2008-03-19T19:33:00.000Z	janerik	Jack_Sparrow	Yes that's correct. First the menu did not show when hitting escape, then I edited it to show menu as default. Now I cant move the marker. And I'm sure it's not the keyboard. All the keys work in f.eks bios. And the grub menu was fine a month ago
2008-03-19T19:51:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	janerik	are you in ubuntu on the same computer?
2008-03-19T19:51:00.000Z	janerik	Jack_Sparrow	Yes. And I think thats may be the same problem
2008-03-19T19:52:00.000Z	janerik	Jack_Sparrow	not the same problem, but mabe thats because I can' access win in grub
2008-03-19T19:56:00.000Z	janerik	Jack_Sparrow	Here is the fstab if you wan't to have a look. The win disk does not mount http://pastebin.org/24442

2008-03-19T20:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	janerik	You must have serious issues on that drive
