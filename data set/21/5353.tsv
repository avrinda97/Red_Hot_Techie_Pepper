2007-11-27T08:26:00.000Z	joules	CochiseIRL	"obex://[00:1a:db:09:54:d1]" is not a valid location.
2007-11-27T08:27:00.000Z	joules	CochiseIRL	?
2007-11-27T08:27:00.000Z	CochiseIRL	joules	i think it looks like your phone or pc dont support obex probably your pc so open synaptic and search for obex and there should be an obex bluetooth utility in there i've seen it before
2007-11-27T08:31:00.000Z	joules	CochiseIRL	i have connected both these on windows and they worked
2007-11-27T08:32:00.000Z	CochiseIRL	joules	you have to install obex on ubuntu
2007-11-27T08:32:00.000Z	joules	CochiseIRL	there are a few applications that come up under obex.. do you know which one?
2007-11-27T08:32:00.000Z	CochiseIRL	joules	i'll check one sec
2007-11-27T08:34:00.000Z	CochiseIRL	joules	search for gnome bluetooth utilites and try that
2007-11-27T08:36:00.000Z	joules	CochiseIRL	thats what im trying to tell you i already have that package

2007-11-27T08:44:00.000Z	joules	CochiseIRL	oh that was better
2007-11-27T08:44:00.000Z	joules	CochiseIRL	it still cant connect but at least it made my cell blink
