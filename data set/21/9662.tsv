2005-08-13T08:21:00.000Z	kaffeend		so I need to run a 32 bit OS on my 64 bit machine? Why did I move from Windows?
2005-08-13T08:21:00.000Z	rob^	kaffeend	both will run
2005-08-13T08:22:00.000Z	rob^	kaffeend	you would obviously use the AMD 64 version on an AMD 64 machine
2005-08-13T08:22:00.000Z	kaffeend	rob^	dadio says I don't
2005-08-13T08:50:00.000Z	rob^	kaffeend	but you have to find and download it first, in Linux you dont

2005-08-13T08:56:00.000Z	kaffeend	rob^	thanks
2005-08-13T09:03:00.000Z	kaffeend	rob^	that wiki link was no good I'm afraid - only deals with systems that already have windows installed
2005-08-13T09:03:00.000Z	rob^	kaffeend	did you read the note at the top?
2005-08-13T09:03:00.000Z	kaffeend	rob^	to install windows first?
2005-08-13T09:04:00.000Z	kaffeend	rob^	yes but I tried that already - I think I need to format the drive first tho
2005-08-13T09:05:00.000Z	kaffeend	rob^	ok
2005-08-13T09:05:00.000Z	rob^	kaffeend	you have two choices, if windows is already installed, follow that guide. if windows is not installed, install if first and when partitioning duing windows installation leave 10gig for Linux (ie leave 10gig free space)
2005-08-13T09:06:00.000Z	kaffeend	rob^	is that for me? gqparted?
2005-08-13T09:08:00.000Z	kaffeend	rob^	what should I do with "gqparted" please?
2005-08-13T09:09:00.000Z	rob^	kaffeend	don't worry about it
2005-08-13T09:09:00.000Z	rob^	kaffeend	you most likely wont need it
2005-08-13T09:09:00.000Z	rob^	kaffeend	install windows, leave free space (unpartitioned) during install, then install Ubuntu into that free space
2005-08-13T09:10:00.000Z	kaffeend	rob^	I think I may need it as when I try to boot the winxp cd it keeps getting stuck after "windows is checking your hardware..."
2005-08-13T09:10:00.000Z	rob^	kaffeend	follow https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WindowsDualBootHowTo
2005-08-13T09:11:00.000Z	rob^	kaffeend	under "Windows XP with NTFS or Any Other NTFS partition"
