2008-11-04T15:35:00.000Z	rww		Anyone know of a decent console IMAP client?
2008-11-04T15:36:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	rww	mutt is good
2009-02-27T06:44:00.000Z	rww	DIFH-iceroot	access to #ubuntu from most web-based clients is blocked because people abused them to spam and troll here. Mibbit still works because the ops can ban individual mibbit users.
2009-02-27T06:45:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	rww	hm ok spam is a problem, but i still like the idea
2009-02-27T06:47:00.000Z	rww	DIFH-iceroot	If you'd like to discuss with the channel ops about getting web-based clients unbanned, ask in #ubuntu-ops. Without that, your idea isn't going to work. Either way, meta-discussion like this /is/ offtopic for this channel.
2009-02-27T06:47:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	rww	ok didnt know that channel
2009-03-04T04:44:00.000Z	rww	DIFH-iceroot	ext2. ext3 uses journalling, which will increase writes to your SSD. You might also want to look at noatime and relatime (fstab options)
2009-03-04T04:44:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	rww	and dont have a journal is ok?
2009-03-04T04:45:00.000Z	rww	DIFH-iceroot	yeah. It's a little less resistant to power failure, but it worked fine for years before ext3 came along ;)
2009-03-04T04:45:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	rww	but if have power failure i can easily recover ext2?
2009-03-04T04:46:00.000Z	rww	DIFH-iceroot	fsck would run on reboot and do it for you, yes
2009-03-04T04:46:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	rww	thank you, i will use ext2 for / and /home
2009-03-21T09:47:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	rww	of course there is  adobe-flashplugin = flash 10  flashplugin-nonfree=flash 9
2009-03-21T09:48:00.000Z	rww	DIFH-iceroot	http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=adobe-flashplugin
2009-03-21T09:48:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	rww	michael@eeebuntu:~$ apt-cache search adobe-flashplugin
2009-03-21T09:49:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	rww	its 8.10 and 8.04 backport
2009-03-21T09:50:00.000Z	rww	DIFH-iceroot	I'm guessing it's in the partner repository, because it sure isn't in any of the normal ones.
2009-03-21T09:50:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	rww	yes, partner-repo
2009-03-21T09:51:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	rww	http://archive.canonical.com hardy/partner Packages
2009-03-21T09:52:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	rww	and canoncial = ubuntu, so there is adobe-flashplugin in the ubuntu-repos :)
2009-03-21T09:52:00.000Z	rww	DIFH-iceroot	Canonical does not equal Ubuntu. But, this is wandering off-topic.
