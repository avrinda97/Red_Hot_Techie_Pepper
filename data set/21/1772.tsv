2010-05-06T08:44:00.000Z	ollie		Anyone want to help me get my display back?
2010-05-06T08:46:00.000Z	ollie		Could anyone help with an X/Grub problem?
2010-05-06T08:46:00.000Z	acerimmer	ollie	describe
2010-05-06T08:46:00.000Z	ollie		I recently got notified for a set of upgrades
2010-05-06T08:46:00.000Z	ollie		one included GRUB
2010-05-06T08:46:00.000Z	ollie		Had previous trouble installing grub to disk after I upgraded to 10.04
2010-05-06T08:46:00.000Z	ollie		Tried to install GRUB again but it failed
2010-05-06T08:47:00.000Z	ollie		Then system crashed
2010-05-06T08:47:00.000Z	ollie		and X hasn't started up since
2010-05-06T08:47:00.000Z	ollie		I'm currently 100% command line
2010-05-06T08:47:00.000Z	acerimmer	ollie	any error msgs?
2010-05-06T08:47:00.000Z	ollie		yeah
2010-05-06T08:47:00.000Z	ollie		It said it could recognize my Logitech Wireless receiver
2010-05-06T08:47:00.000Z	ollie		presumably for my mouse
2010-05-06T08:47:00.000Z	ollie		Removing that did nothing
2010-05-06T08:48:00.000Z	ollie		Sorry
2010-05-06T08:50:00.000Z	ollie	acerimmer	any advice?
2010-05-06T08:51:00.000Z	acerimmer	ollie	can't seem to recall anything quite the way you've described.  Assuming the system is still in place, i'd sya you're looking at a grub rescue situation.  Soluation is in the forums or google "reinstall grub"
2010-05-06T08:52:00.000Z	acerimmer		!grub rescue|ollie
2010-05-06T08:52:00.000Z	ollie	acerimmer	can you suggest a command line browser that i could use? Currently I'm quite limited
2010-05-06T08:53:00.000Z	acerimmer	ollie	oops.  if there's a CLI browser, i'm completely unaware of it.  sorry
