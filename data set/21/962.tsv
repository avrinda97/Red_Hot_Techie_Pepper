2011-03-25T13:21:00.000Z	JonesNH		Hi how do I install wordpress?
2011-03-25T13:21:00.000Z	JonesNH		'apt-get install wordpress'
2011-03-25T13:21:00.000Z	JonesNH		?
2011-03-25T13:22:00.000Z	Starminn	JonesNH	Yes. http://packages.ubuntu.com/maverick/web/ Down in "w" yeah
2011-03-25T13:23:00.000Z	Starminn	JonesNH	(That's a list of all packages pertaining to Web. That site, thought, lists all packages so when in doubt you can check it.)
2011-03-25T13:23:00.000Z	JonesNH	Starminn	so it is possible?
2011-03-25T13:23:00.000Z	Starminn		!packages | JonesNH
2011-03-25T13:24:00.000Z	JonesNH		so dr0id was wrong
2011-03-25T13:24:00.000Z	JonesNH		"lol"
2011-03-25T13:24:00.000Z	Starminn	JonesNH	Yeah, according to Ubuntu.com the package for wordpress is "wordpress"
2011-03-25T13:24:00.000Z	JonesNH		is there not a way to specify where u want a packagge installed with apt-get?
2011-03-25T13:25:00.000Z	Starminn	JonesNH	It takes care of all of that for you by default, but I don't know about telling it where to go. I know what you're trying to do and I remember when I installed Apache it went all over the place.
2011-03-25T13:26:00.000Z	Starminn	JonesNH	Try this: http://nixcraft.com/ubuntu-debian/14489-how-does-apt-get-install-work.html
2011-03-25T13:26:00.000Z	JonesNH	Starminn	will installing that package automatically configure apache for wordpress destination?
2011-03-25T13:26:00.000Z	JonesNH		or not
2011-03-25T13:27:00.000Z	Starminn	JonesNH	I don't know. I don't use Wordpress -- I use my own backends (though my needs are quite basic)
2011-03-25T13:27:00.000Z	Starminn	JonesNH	The link I just gave you was intended to kind of make you think, "Well, I could take each step menually myself" which would let you install where you wanted (just not with "apt-get)
2011-03-25T13:28:00.000Z	JonesNH		Why?
2011-03-25T13:29:00.000Z	JonesNH		UBUNTU HATES GOOGLE?
2011-03-25T13:29:00.000Z	Starminn		!google | smw
2011-03-25T13:30:00.000Z	Starminn	JonesNH	And actually Canonical agreed to help Google with making the ChromeOS, so no, far from it
