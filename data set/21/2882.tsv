2009-07-19T23:05:00.000Z	Jimmio	linuxguy2009	Nothing at all :(
2009-07-19T22:59:00.000Z	Jimmio	linuxguy2009	Printscreen doesn't work... any ideas why? Shortcut seems broken...
2009-07-19T23:00:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	Jimmio	just go to Applications menu, accessories, take screenshot.Itll open the screenshot tool.
2009-07-19T23:02:00.000Z	Jimmio	linuxguy2009	I know that, but after a recent HAL update, more of the keyboard shortcuts work, but print screen broke. Should I file a bug report for something as small as that?
2009-07-19T23:03:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	Jimmio	Was your HAL update done manually or within system updates?
2009-07-19T23:04:00.000Z	Jimmio	linuxguy2009	It was automatically updated.
2009-07-19T23:07:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	Jimmio	open the screenshot tool and just use the window.Problem solved.
2009-07-19T23:07:00.000Z	Jimmio	linuxguy2009	Whoaaa... Since when does Fn keys work? My keyboard has Print Screen and Open Context Menu as the same key with the modifier being Fn. That button works, but not printscreen.. and I can't set things to use Fn and something.
2009-07-19T23:08:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	Jimmio	Does your Fn key have a toggle idicator?
2009-07-19T23:09:00.000Z	Jimmio	linuxguy2009	I'm not sure I understand what you mean... Toggle indicator? It has to be held to use those keys.
2009-07-19T23:09:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	Jimmio	Thats what i was wondering. ok
2009-07-19T23:10:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	Jimmio	Check your keyboard shortcuts in System, preferences, keyboard shortcuts. Theres one there for screencapturing. See if its empty and or if you can set it manually to whatever you like.
2009-07-19T23:11:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	Jimmio	Should be print and alt + print for each listed as defaults.
2009-07-19T23:12:00.000Z	Jimmio	linuxguy2009	It's set to Print... I reset them, still don't work and Alt Print reads as Alt Sys Req
2009-07-19T23:13:00.000Z	Jimmio	linuxguy2009	While that does solve the issue, My keyboard should still work properly... >_>
2009-07-19T23:13:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	Jimmio	Well it doesnt >_>
2009-07-19T23:14:00.000Z	Jimmio	linuxguy2009	I noticed. How hard is it to detect keys that are reading as scan codes 5xxxxx? It can't be that hard really. Keytouch can read them, but it breaks everything else it seems..
2009-07-19T23:15:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	Jimmio	Every OS comes with bugs.
2009-07-19T23:16:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	Jimmio	Maybe boot the live CD and try your keyboard there? if it doesnt work there, then it may be your hardware and not Ubuntu.
2009-07-19T23:20:00.000Z	Jimmio	linuxguy2009	Well, that's true. But recently I've been using Ubuntu 100% bug free, and just noticed that it stopped using print screen. It works fine btw, as it used to work here. It's really not that big of a deal, but I'd like to use some of the shortcut keys that are built in.. I'm using Ubuntu for game engine development and so far it's going great. Things are so easy... Need SDL? sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev I can't wai
