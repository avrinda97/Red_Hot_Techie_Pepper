2006-12-20T09:52:00.000Z	|rt|	mc44	that depends on the filesystem...but I don't believe that ext3 supports in place resizing of mounted file systems
2006-12-20T09:53:00.000Z	mc44	|rt|	oh really, what fs's can?
2006-12-20T09:54:00.000Z	|rt|	mc44	any of the more modern journaled filesystems can...ext3 is the exception in this case...not the rule
2006-12-20T09:54:00.000Z	mc44	|rt|	ah like Reiser or somesuch?
2006-12-20T09:54:00.000Z	|rt|	mc44	xfs and jfs both support live resizing
2006-12-20T09:55:00.000Z	mc44	|rt|	interesting. of course Ive heard too many xfs horror stories to switch to that :)
2006-12-20T09:55:00.000Z	|rt|	mc44	i only have experience doing it with xfs....but I manage a 20+TB file server here with LVM and xfs...and are constantly growing logical volumes and file systems while they are in use
2006-12-20T09:56:00.000Z	|rt|	mc44	I've never had any problems with xfs...even when I had a scsi cable fail making parts of a xfs volume suddenly disappear that was in use
2006-12-20T09:56:00.000Z	mc44	|rt|	thanks. Im sure virtually any advice I give in here is generally wrong :)
2006-12-20T09:56:00.000Z	|rt|	mc44	xfs cleaned up itself
2006-12-20T09:56:00.000Z	|rt|	mc44	now i doubt that's true
2006-12-20T09:57:00.000Z	|rt|	mc44	if you look for horror stories on file systems you will find that you should be printing out all your data and retaining hard copies
2006-12-20T09:58:00.000Z	mc44	|rt|	punchcards ftw!
2006-12-20T09:58:00.000Z	|rt|	mc44	every file system has horror stories and success stories...in both cases you have to take those stories with a grain of salt
2006-12-20T09:58:00.000Z	mc44	|rt|	true enough
2006-12-20T09:59:00.000Z	|rt|	mc44	resier for instance has a horrible fragmentation problem that causes the volumes to slow down drastically as they are used...currently the only way around this is to tar up the data to a different volume, reformat the volume and then untar your data back
2006-12-20T10:00:00.000Z	|rt|	mc44	hopefully resier4 can address those issues on paper it looks to be pretty nice
2006-12-20T10:00:00.000Z	mc44	|rt|	yeah, I stick to ext3 just because I really dont need and particular journalling features
2006-12-20T10:01:00.000Z	|rt|	mc44	yeah ext3 is the safe choice....of course the one time i have lost data due to a file system it was ext3 hehe...so there's a horror story
2006-12-20T10:01:00.000Z	mc44	|rt|	damn I have t change now
2006-12-20T10:02:00.000Z	|rt|	mc44	hehe...i still run all my / as ext3 even after that event
