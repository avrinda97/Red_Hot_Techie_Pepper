2007-03-16T07:25:00.000Z	fruitbag`		I think I know why.
2007-03-16T07:26:00.000Z	fruitbag`		Ah...
2007-03-16T07:26:00.000Z	fruitbag`		I have an idea.
2007-03-16T07:27:00.000Z	fruitbag`		Hey.
2007-03-16T07:28:00.000Z	fruitbag`		I'm having an issue with concatenation...
2007-03-16T07:29:00.000Z	fruitbag`		Any thoughts?
2007-03-16T07:29:00.000Z	fruitbag`		Can anyone here help out?
2007-03-16T07:30:00.000Z	fruitbag`		When I try to concatenate, I get a 'premission denied'
2007-03-16T07:30:00.000Z	fruitbag`		Why is that?
2007-03-16T07:30:00.000Z	fruitbag`		;\
2007-03-16T07:30:00.000Z	jrib	fruitbag`	tell us exactly what you are concatenating
2007-03-16T07:31:00.000Z	jrib	fruitbag`	the redirection there is done by the shell, which only has user permissions.  pipe to tee instead, for example:   echo "foo" | tee /some/file
2007-03-16T07:35:00.000Z	jrib	fruitbag`	I explained it to you before
2007-03-16T07:39:00.000Z	jrib	fruitbag`	other than redirection, what is getting denied?
2007-03-16T07:48:00.000Z	jrib	fruitbag`	do you understand what the > does?
2007-03-16T07:48:00.000Z	fruitbag`	jrib	not exactly.
2007-03-16T07:50:00.000Z	jrib	fruitbag`	ok, try this in your shell:  echo "foo"    then try this:   echo "foo" > ~/bar  .  You'll see that all that the '>' does is _redirect_ the output of the previous command to the file called ~/bar .  The shell is what actually does this redirection
2007-03-16T07:53:00.000Z	jrib	fruitbag`	think of a t-shaped pipe
2010-08-28T18:56:00.000Z	jrib	fruitbag`	best to just ask the channel your actual question (on a single line)
2010-08-28T18:57:00.000Z	fruitbag`	jrib	well, I've connected a SATA RAID array to my Ubuntu machine. I am told that there are not enough components.
2010-08-28T18:58:00.000Z	jrib	fruitbag`	ask the channel, not me
