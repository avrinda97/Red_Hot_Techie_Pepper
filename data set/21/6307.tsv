2007-04-23T12:20:00.000Z	RayzrShrp		I guess ubuntu is popular
2007-04-23T12:22:00.000Z	RayzrShrp		anybody tell me the difference between server and desktop?
2007-04-23T12:22:00.000Z	RayzrShrp		does server have no x windows in it?
2007-04-23T12:22:00.000Z	nevermind	RayzrShrp	nope, but you can install it using apt-get install ubuntu-desktop or kubuntu-destop or xubuntu-desktop :)
2007-04-23T12:23:00.000Z	RayzrShrp	nevermind	yep learned the hard way and did an apt-get install kubuntu
2007-04-23T12:23:00.000Z	RayzrShrp	nevermind	i don't like kde and didn't know about ubuntu-dekstop
2007-04-23T12:23:00.000Z	RayzrShrp	nevermind	doing apt-get remove kbuntu isnt going to get t all will it?
2007-04-23T12:24:00.000Z	nevermind	RayzrShrp	now yo do :) those are metapackages
2007-04-23T12:24:00.000Z	RayzrShrp	nevermind	i figure tonight ill blow it away and reinstall the desktop iso i downloaded
2007-04-23T12:25:00.000Z	nevermind	RayzrShrp	if you want to remove KDE and use Gnome i'll do sudo dpkg --purge kubuntu-desktop
2007-04-23T12:25:00.000Z	nevermind	RayzrShrp	and then install ubuntu-desktop
2007-04-23T12:25:00.000Z	RayzrShrp	nevermind	soi dont need to do apt-get remove first?
2007-04-23T12:26:00.000Z	nevermind	RayzrShrp	apt-get won't remove config files, dpkg --purge will wipe out them
2007-04-23T12:26:00.000Z	RayzrShrp	nevermind	ok so it boils down to server has no X and office stuff and desktop has gnome native and office stuff more or less?
2007-04-23T12:27:00.000Z	nevermind	RayzrShrp	it will remove everythjing related to KDE wich you don't like :)
2007-04-23T12:27:00.000Z	RayzrShrp	nevermind	nice
2007-04-23T12:29:00.000Z	nevermind	RayzrShrp	with --purge you'll have no problems
