2007-09-16T07:45:00.000Z	rdvon		Hello, Is their an ipconfig /all equivalent in linux? :)
2007-09-16T07:45:00.000Z	wastrel	rdvon	 ifconfig
2007-09-16T07:49:00.000Z	wastrel	rdvon	 route   will give you the gateway  (the "default")
2007-09-16T07:50:00.000Z	rdvon	wastrel	it gives me an * symbol under gateway..
2007-09-16T07:50:00.000Z	wastrel	rdvon	 default gateway's not set then :] 
2007-09-16T07:50:00.000Z	rdvon	wastrel	how do i set it? in the knetwork manager? :] 
2007-09-16T07:51:00.000Z	wastrel	rdvon	 sudo route add default gw <gateway address>     dunno from kde
2007-09-16T07:52:00.000Z	rdvon	wastrel	hmm... What's a good gate way?
2007-09-16T07:52:00.000Z	wastrel	rdvon	 the one for your network :]    usually the .1 address
2007-09-16T07:53:00.000Z	wastrel	rdvon	 ex: my ip is 192.168.2.105  my gateway is 192.168.2.1
2007-09-16T07:53:00.000Z	rdvon	wastrel	it says network unreachable!
2007-09-16T07:54:00.000Z	wastrel	rdvon	 are you trying to ping it?
2007-09-16T07:54:00.000Z	rdvon	wastrel	i typed this: sudo route add default gw 192.168.1.1
2007-09-16T07:55:00.000Z	rdvon	wastrel	it says word for word: SIOCADDRT: Network is unreachable
2007-09-16T07:56:00.000Z	wastrel	rdvon	 i'm guessing you don't have a network interface configured yet on the 192.168.1.* network
2007-09-16T07:56:00.000Z	rdvon	wastrel	i'll just go up 1 everytime than tell I figure out which one has it ;)
2007-09-16T07:57:00.000Z	rdvon	wastrel	it's not working.. :(
2007-09-16T07:57:00.000Z	wastrel	rdvon	 you need to configure a network interface first
2007-09-16T07:57:00.000Z	rdvon	wastrel	oh. :] 
2007-09-16T07:57:00.000Z	rdvon	wastrel	How do i configure a network interface :)
2007-09-16T07:58:00.000Z	rdvon	wastrel	is there any reason for my internet connection to keep resetting itself?
