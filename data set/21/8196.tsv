2006-10-04T10:09:00.000Z	ArrenLex		Elliot: you need to read more.
2006-10-04T10:09:00.000Z	ArrenLex		Elliot: from that site, top line:  If you didn't have as much foresight and chose instead to install KDE or XFCE through Synaptic or apt-get, this is how to remove those desktop environments from your Gnome.
2006-10-04T10:09:00.000Z	ArrenLex		elliot: which stuff you want to keep does it remove?
2006-10-04T10:10:00.000Z	ArrenLex		asdf: Have you seen this guide? It seems like what you want. http://www.sorgonet.com/linux/grubrestore/
2006-10-04T10:10:00.000Z	ArrenLex		asdf: replace "redhat boot disk" with "any Linux recovery disk:

2006-10-04T10:11:00.000Z	ArrenLex		misteroboto: some of us don't want a bunch of crap on our hard drives, however vast they may or may not be.
2006-10-04T10:12:00.000Z	mister_roboto_	ArrenLex	it's not exactly crap though. but i understand.
2006-10-04T10:13:00.000Z	mister_roboto_	ArrenLex	i use kde, have for years
2006-10-04T10:13:00.000Z	mister_roboto_	ArrenLex	what exactly is crap?
2006-10-04T10:15:00.000Z	mister_roboto_	ArrenLex	i'm running kubuntu and have none of that stuff
2006-10-04T10:15:00.000Z	mister_roboto_	ArrenLex	not sure how you picked it up
2006-10-04T10:16:00.000Z	mister_roboto_	ArrenLex	this is a fresh install of edgy on this machine though so ymmv
2006-10-04T10:16:00.000Z	mister_roboto_	ArrenLex	i'm specifically talking about the stuff you said YOU had on YOUR machine, like the japanese dictionary and povmodeler
2006-10-04T10:19:00.000Z	mister_roboto_	ArrenLex	besides the games, quanta and kwifimanager are very useful. quanta is an awesome html editor
2006-10-04T10:21:00.000Z	mister_roboto_	ArrenLex	of course you could make the same complaint about all the "crap" in ubuntu (gnome desktop)
2006-10-04T10:23:00.000Z	mister_roboto_	ArrenLex	good practice for a server. i find it hard to get too anal about a desktop with a big disk though, as long as all the services are tightly under control
2006-10-04T10:27:00.000Z	mister_roboto_	ArrenLex	you'd probably be better off going with Linux From Scratch ;)
