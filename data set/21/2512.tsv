2011-11-20T15:15:00.000Z	Zta		How do I completely reset my Unity desktop settings?  It's completely fubar.  Neither the dash nor the system menus to the right of the system tray appears. The only reason Pidgin starts is becasue it's set to autostart.
2011-11-20T15:16:00.000Z	Zta		I tried adding a new user on my system, and that user's desktop looks nice; so it must be an issue purely related to configuration.
2011-11-20T15:16:00.000Z	Zta		I tried "unity --reset" but doesn't reset much really
2011-11-20T15:18:00.000Z	Zta		nono
2011-11-20T15:18:00.000Z	Zta		How do I make my Unity useful again?
2011-11-20T15:19:00.000Z	Zta		If only I could rm -fr ~/.unity but these days are over since every app is using that freggin' gconf crap.
2011-11-20T15:20:00.000Z	Zta		Crikey my theme has also died; my terminal is all gray
2011-11-20T15:22:00.000Z	Zta		kill it is
2011-11-20T15:24:00.000Z	Zta		Moving .compiz-1 out of its place didn't help a bit.
2011-11-20T15:25:00.000Z	theadmin	Zta	What exactly are you trying to do?
2011-11-20T15:27:00.000Z	Zta	theadmin	My theme has changed into something ugly, my left menu (dash?) doesn't appear, my top menu only shows the menu items of the desktop (File, Edit, View...) and not the system tray not the system menus (with logout, etc).  Basically my desktop is screwed and I simply want to restore it into something useful again.
2011-11-20T15:27:00.000Z	theadmin	Zta	Try this: unity --reset
2011-11-20T15:27:00.000Z	Zta	theadmin	I did.  Doesn't help.
2011-11-20T15:28:00.000Z	theadmin	Zta	Hm, allright, this one is a bit evil -- it resets all the GNOME settings, but I beleive it should help for sure: gconftool-2 --recursive-unset /
2011-11-20T15:28:00.000Z	Zta	theadmin	can I just unset the unity parts, please? =)
2011-11-20T15:29:00.000Z	Zta	theadmin	I can I save the setting of all apps into different files first, and then restore them one by one after the recursive-unset?
2011-11-20T15:30:00.000Z	theadmin	Zta	My apologies, I forgot GNOME 3 no longer uses gconf, it uses something new and weird (dconf) and I have no idea how to deal with it
2011-11-20T15:30:00.000Z	Zta	theadmin	btw: unity --reset doesn't seem to finish.  It hangs in a Setting Update "initiate_key"
2011-11-20T15:31:00.000Z	theadmin	Zta	Linux? lol, Linux has always been complex. What happened is Ubuntu becoming weird.
2011-11-20T15:32:00.000Z	Zta	theadmin	Once upon a time everything thing had its own configuration file.  It was easy to backup, reset, restore and change.  Now it's just one big magic blob that you hope works.  If it breaks, you're doomed.
2011-11-20T15:32:00.000Z	theadmin	Zta	Yeah, well... Use some desktop environment which doesn't store settings in some pseudo-registry (i.e. not gnome)
