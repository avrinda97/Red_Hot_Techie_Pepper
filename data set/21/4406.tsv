2008-05-03T13:45:00.000Z	TheBigNoob	magnetron	I think you will be fine with those temps, you don't plan on running any 3d environments do you?

2008-05-03T13:50:00.000Z	magnetron	TheBigNoob	sorry, i didn't see your question.
2008-05-03T13:51:00.000Z	magnetron	TheBigNoob	you've added the horiz and vert sync to your xorg.conf?
2008-05-03T13:51:00.000Z	TheBigNoob	magnetron	what should it look like if I want it at 60hz?
2008-05-03T13:54:00.000Z	magnetron	TheBigNoob	you have to add info to your xorg.conf about your monitor. you cannot simply choose a refresh rate, as this would be different with different resolutions. you need to add two values in the xorg.conf, the horizontal and vertical sync. these can usually be found in your monitor manual
2008-05-03T13:57:00.000Z	TheBigNoob	magnetron	wish me luck I'm gonna restart
