2011-10-08T20:52:00.000Z	iwaka_		Hello everyone! Just installed Ubuntu and I have a question regarding drive partitioning (I couldn't find an answer in the manuals either). Is partitioning really necessary? I deleted Windows and have only Ubuntu on an unpartitioned drive, is it necessary for me to partition the drive? Is it too late?
2011-10-08T20:53:00.000Z	DustyMonk	iwaka_	yes, linux installation is based on partitioning
2011-10-08T20:54:00.000Z	iwaka_	DustyMonk	so what would partitioning give me in comparison with an unpartitioned install? And can I partition the drive now, after I installed Ubuntu?
2011-10-08T20:54:00.000Z	DustyMonk	iwaka_	during install, you will be asked to partition
2011-10-08T20:56:00.000Z	iwaka_	DustyMonk	I didn't partition the drive during the installation, should I reinstall the whole system from scratch, or can I repartition after having completed the installation?
2011-10-08T20:56:00.000Z	DustyMonk	iwaka_	you cannot install without partitioning
2011-10-08T20:56:00.000Z	iwaka_		eerrr... I just did, apparently. Unless i'm missing something...
2011-10-08T20:57:00.000Z	DustyMonk	iwaka_	perhaps you did not see it happen
2011-10-08T20:57:00.000Z	DustyMonk	iwaka_	type mount|pastebinit and paste it here
2011-10-08T21:01:00.000Z	iwaka_	DustyMonk	http://paste.ubuntu.com/704527/
2011-10-08T21:03:00.000Z	DustyMonk	iwaka_	i see no /home, no root and no swap, so it is not installed
2011-10-08T21:04:00.000Z	DustyMonk	iwaka_	did you use wubi?
2011-10-08T21:04:00.000Z	iwaka_	DustyMonk	I created a USB drive and installed Ubuntu, replacing the system completely
2011-10-08T21:05:00.000Z	iwaka_	DustyMonk	I used wubi before, but not during this install.
2011-10-08T21:06:00.000Z	DustyMonk	iwaka_	looks very strange to me
2011-10-08T21:07:00.000Z	iwaka_	DustyMonk	The installation did not prompt me to partition the drive, perhaps that is the source of this... problem
2011-10-08T21:08:00.000Z	DustyMonk	iwaka_	i dont know what this is: fuse.gvfs-fuse-daemon
2011-10-08T21:08:00.000Z	iwaka_	DustyMonk	I only installed the system yesterday, there can't be any trash here...
2011-10-08T21:09:00.000Z	DustyMonk	iwaka_	kindly repeat your initial question, maybe someone else can help
2011-10-08T21:11:00.000Z	iwaka_		I installed Ubuntu but did not partition the drive. Should I partition it, and if so, how should I do it? I'm NOT using dual-boot, just Ubuntu.
2011-10-08T21:11:00.000Z	iwaka_	DustyMonk	thank you very much for your help :)
