2006-08-29T16:24:00.000Z	archaios	kholerabbi	their
2006-08-29T16:25:00.000Z	kholerabbi	archaios	where?
2006-08-29T16:25:00.000Z	archaios	kholerabbi	"alright"
2006-08-29T16:26:00.000Z	kholerabbi	archaios	nope. "s'allright" double-L because I am talking in Modern Old English and I am simply joining the words "all" and "right" :P
2006-08-29T16:26:00.000Z	archaios	kholerabbi	then it would be "s'all'right"
2006-08-29T16:26:00.000Z	archaios	kholerabbi	all contractions involving removal of space require an apostrophe
2006-08-29T16:27:00.000Z	archaios	kholerabbi	but the more correct way would be 's'all right
2006-08-29T16:28:00.000Z	kholerabbi	archaios	no, the s was simply for sound effects :P
2006-08-29T16:28:00.000Z	archaios	kholerabbi	the "'s'" is a contraction of "it's" which is in itself a contraction of "it is"
2006-08-29T16:28:00.000Z	archaios	kholerabbi	it is an exclusively Australian usage
2006-08-29T16:29:00.000Z	kholerabbi	archaios	Grammar is defined by its use. I am speaking colloquially and thus correctly
2006-08-29T16:29:00.000Z	archaios	kholerabbi	I am not saying it is wrong
2006-08-29T16:29:00.000Z	kholerabbi	archaios	indeed it is not exclusively Australian, as its in Harry Potter
2006-08-29T16:29:00.000Z	archaios	kholerabbi	it originated in Australia
2006-08-29T16:29:00.000Z	archaios	kholerabbi	I assure you
2006-08-29T16:30:00.000Z	archaios	kholerabbi	read any dictionary of etymology
2006-08-29T16:30:00.000Z	archaios	kholerabbi	/whois
2006-08-29T16:30:00.000Z	archaios	kholerabbi	as are you
