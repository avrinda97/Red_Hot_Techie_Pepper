2006-06-07T16:06:00.000Z	Flannel	NET||abuse	ask in #ubuntu-xgl
2006-06-07T16:07:00.000Z	NET||abuse	Flannel	been asking, no one answers
2006-06-27T14:51:00.000Z	Flannel	NET||abuse	write isnt too stable yet, and if it is, it'll be in edgy (I think its slated for addition in edgy anyway), it wouldve been released too late for Dapper.
2006-11-29T17:56:00.000Z	NET||abuse	Flannel	thanks :)
2007-02-03T16:14:00.000Z	Flannel	NET||abuse	that defeats the purpose of package management
2007-02-03T16:14:00.000Z	NET||abuse	Flannel	no, it's just to refresh the install, it's postfix, aptitude reinstall won't do what i need
2007-02-03T16:14:00.000Z	NET||abuse	Flannel	i just need to remove postfix completely without affecting the courier install, then reinstall it immediatly
2007-02-03T16:21:00.000Z	Flannel	NET||abuse	why aren't you just removing postfix, with it courier, then reinstalling both?
2007-02-03T16:22:00.000Z	NET||abuse	Flannel	as i have data in courier that i can't get back
2007-02-03T16:22:00.000Z	Flannel	NET||abuse	removing (just removing, not --purging) doesn't remove any config/etc.  You can always back it up, anyway
2007-02-03T16:25:00.000Z	Flannel	NET||abuse	don't purge courier, just purge postfix.  (uninstall courier)
2007-02-03T16:27:00.000Z	NET||abuse	Flannel	ohh, ok, so i can uninstall postfix and allow it to remove courier, then purge postfix, then reinstall postfix and courier
2007-02-03T16:27:00.000Z	Flannel	NET||abuse	correct.
2007-08-13T14:58:00.000Z	Flannel	NET||abuse	take it apart, completely.  Wash it with distilled water (the salts in the water can cause problems) and then dry it out completely.
2007-08-13T14:59:00.000Z	NET||abuse	Flannel	well, right now i have my hard drive in this alternate laptop and i just need the xserver config to work
2007-08-13T15:00:00.000Z	Flannel	NET||abuse	If you dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, it should do it.
2007-08-13T15:00:00.000Z	NET||abuse	Flannel	thanks, i'll try that! :)
2008-03-24T20:53:00.000Z	Flannel	NET||abuse	#ubuntu+1 for Hardy support, thanks.
2008-03-24T20:53:00.000Z	NET||abuse	Flannel	ohh, ok,, thanks
