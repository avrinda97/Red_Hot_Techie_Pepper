2012-03-29T00:55:00.000Z	mody	Si2100	i found this describe my problem http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/ubuntu/reinstall-ubuntu-grub-bootloader-after-windows-wipes-it-out/
2012-03-29T00:56:00.000Z	Si2100	mody	When i did it.. it required alot more than that... had to mount the main drive, and then install GRUB2 and then unmount and then reboot
2012-03-29T01:12:00.000Z	mody	Si2100	still there?
2012-03-29T01:34:00.000Z	Si2100	mody	the only thing it would remove is the grub sector
2012-03-29T01:35:00.000Z	Si2100	mody	you just need to reinstall GRUb
