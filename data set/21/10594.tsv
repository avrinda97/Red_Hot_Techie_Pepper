2005-03-24T06:00:00.000Z	eni_		which is the hava package name in apt-get ?
2005-03-24T06:00:00.000Z	eni_		s/hava/java
2005-03-24T06:01:00.000Z	eyequeue	eni_	 see ubuntuguide, or the wiki
2005-03-24T06:01:00.000Z	eni_		do you know its name : eyequeue ?
2005-03-24T06:01:00.000Z	eyequeue	eni_	 one of those two gives a detailed howto, since it's not in ubuntu proper, iirc
2005-03-24T06:01:00.000Z	eyequeue	eni_	 hence there is no name you can just plug in
2005-03-24T06:03:00.000Z	eni_		what do you mean ? eyequeue
2005-03-24T06:03:00.000Z	eni_		I do apt-get install java and there is no package named java
2005-03-24T06:03:00.000Z	eni_		apt-cache search java and I get a big list.
2005-03-24T06:03:00.000Z	eyequeue	eni_	 you'd need to add some special repositories or some other special procedure, not a simple apt-get
2005-03-24T06:04:00.000Z	eyequeue	eni_	 i know i read it there, just didn't feel like adding non-free things to my box, so basically ignored it
2005-03-24T06:04:00.000Z	eni_		???
2005-03-24T06:04:00.000Z	eni_	cocol	is it named jre ?
2005-03-24T06:04:00.000Z	eni_		root@galaxy:/tmp # apt-get install jre
2005-03-24T06:04:00.000Z	eni_		Reading Package Lists... Done
2005-03-24T06:04:00.000Z	eni_		Building Dependency Tree... Done
2005-03-24T06:04:00.000Z	eni_		E: Couldn't find package jre
2005-03-24T06:05:00.000Z	eyequeue	eni_	 that would be a runtime only not a jdk
2005-03-24T06:05:00.000Z	eyequeue	eni_	 and again, non-free
2005-03-24T06:05:00.000Z	eni_		I have to pay ? or what?
2005-03-24T06:06:00.000Z	eyequeue	eni_	 freedom doesn't really correspond to payment status
