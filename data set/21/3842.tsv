2012-08-09T20:43:00.000Z	john515		can somebody tell me why I get "command not found"? My script is placed in /etc/init.d , I registered it with update-rc.d , and it's code is the following: http://pastebin.com/S1NMzFUi
2012-08-09T20:43:00.000Z	bekks	john515	What are the permissions of that file?
2012-08-09T20:44:00.000Z	john515		using chmod a+x solved it
2012-08-09T20:44:00.000Z	john515		thanks
2012-08-09T20:44:00.000Z	john515		missed that tidbit
2012-08-09T20:50:00.000Z	john515	TJ-	bekks : I got Starting daemon: flashpolicydGot Errno::EISDIR Is a directory - / while attempting to create logfile
2012-08-09T20:50:00.000Z	bekks	john515	Thats not "command not found". :9
2012-08-09T20:50:00.000Z	john515		after I did a+x
2012-08-09T20:50:00.000Z	john515		:P
2012-08-09T20:51:00.000Z	john515		prior to chmod a+x I had "command not found", now it's this
2012-08-09T20:51:00.000Z	john515		oh
2012-08-09T20:52:00.000Z	john515		from terminal it does work though
2012-08-09T20:52:00.000Z	john515		have I done something wrong within the script?
2012-08-09T20:52:00.000Z	bekks	john515	We have no clue, what you've done - when not running an init script from the terminal.
2012-08-09T20:53:00.000Z	john515		sec
2012-08-09T20:53:00.000Z	john515		log didn't get created for some reason
2012-08-09T20:54:00.000Z	john515		you're right
2012-08-09T20:54:00.000Z	john515		I just wanted them together, if possible
2012-08-09T20:54:00.000Z	john515		lemme check
2012-08-09T20:54:00.000Z	bekks	john515	All other logs are reside in /var/log :)
