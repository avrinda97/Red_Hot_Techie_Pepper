2006-07-05T10:25:00.000Z	jorgeu	ljlolel	already saw it, it says that "dpkg-reconfigure locales" should work, but it doesn't
2006-07-05T10:26:00.000Z	ljlolel	jorgeu	as in, it crashes?
2006-07-05T10:26:00.000Z	jorgeu	ljlolel	it just start to genereate the already configured locales and don't let me choose wich generate
2006-07-05T10:27:00.000Z	ljlolel	jorgeu	i see what you mean
2006-07-05T10:28:00.000Z	ljlolel	jorgeu	what does localedef do?
2006-07-05T10:28:00.000Z	ljlolel	jorgeu	utf8 is awesome though ;-)
2006-07-05T10:29:00.000Z	jorgeu	ljlolel	not for spanish
2006-07-05T10:29:00.000Z	jorgeu	ljlolel	i really hate UTF-8
2006-07-05T10:29:00.000Z	ljlolel	jorgeu	really? it has fewer characters than others?
2006-07-05T10:30:00.000Z	jorgeu	ljlolel	it just has a lot of incompatibilities with my apps and my language
2006-07-05T10:31:00.000Z	ljlolel	jorgeu	so a lot of spanish apps use something other than utf-8?
2006-07-05T10:31:00.000Z	jorgeu	ljlolel	iso-8859-1
2006-07-05T10:32:00.000Z	ljlolel	jorgeu	I see.. that sucks.. and o/s or whatever doesn't upconvert it to utf-8?
2006-07-05T10:32:00.000Z	jorgeu	ljlolel	going reboot, i have try your workaround
2006-07-05T10:33:00.000Z	jorgeu	ljlolel	thanks
2006-07-05T10:44:00.000Z	jorgeu	ljlolel	ok, i had to change the file locales.def from gdm configuration and delete the line conrresponding to es_VE.UTF-8 and now everything work well. Thanks for the workaround
2006-07-05T10:44:00.000Z	ljlolel	jorgeu	good work
2006-07-05T10:44:00.000Z	ljlolel	jorgeu	how hard would it be to update the locales wiki with that info so that everyone else will have an easier time?
2006-07-05T10:45:00.000Z	jorgeu	ljlolel	no clue
2006-07-05T10:45:00.000Z	ljlolel	jorgeu	if you set up an ubuntu account it'd take a second
