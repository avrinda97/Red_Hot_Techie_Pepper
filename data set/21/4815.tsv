2008-07-24T04:07:00.000Z	nickrud	mgreen	3.0 is in gutsy-backports?
2008-07-24T04:07:00.000Z	mgreen	nickrud	http://packages.ubuntu.com/gutsy-backports/web/
2008-07-24T04:08:00.000Z	mgreen	nickrud	yes, the backports way is better
2008-07-24T04:10:00.000Z	nickrud	mgreen	he's just got to get firefox (binary) on the path, and having the link in ~/bin works very well since he put the binary in his home
2008-07-24T04:11:00.000Z	mgreen	nickrud	yes, that will work, but it's not a very good way to do it
2008-07-24T04:12:00.000Z	nickrud	mgreen	have you noticed my mentioning of backports?
2008-07-24T04:12:00.000Z	mgreen	nickrud	by the tone of that, i should probably just go to bed ;)
2008-07-24T04:12:00.000Z	nickrud	mgreen	having ~/bin conditionally added to the path you mean?
2008-07-24T04:12:00.000Z	nickrud	mgreen	there's a tonne of ways to do this ;)
2008-07-24T04:13:00.000Z	nickrud	mgreen	tone not meant to be dismissive by the way :)
2008-07-24T04:13:00.000Z	mgreen	nickrud	and teq, i thought you guys were trying to install ff3 under gutsy
2008-07-24T04:13:00.000Z	nickrud	mgreen	yep. Didn't realize it was in backports, that's why I've switched paths
2008-07-24T04:14:00.000Z	mgreen	nickrud	great. that's a better path, since security updates and such will work much better.
2008-07-24T04:15:00.000Z	nickrud	mgreen	heh. I have no faith in security for backports, I believe what I read. And, firefox does autoupgrade when installed binary. I prefer the ones in the repos myself though for a variety of reasons
2008-07-24T04:16:00.000Z	mgreen	nickrud	yes, but backports is most often better than manually compiling/installing packages
2008-07-24T04:17:00.000Z	nickrud	mgreen	yep. One of the primary reasons. I trust 'technical excellence' ;)
2008-07-24T04:18:00.000Z	mgreen	nickrud	yeah, micromanagement is no fun ;)
2008-07-24T04:20:00.000Z	mgreen	nickrud	there is a graphical way to add the backports sources
2008-07-24T04:20:00.000Z	nickrud	mgreen	he said he couldn't find it, so ...
2008-07-24T04:20:00.000Z	mgreen	nickrud	ok, time to sleep, it seems :)
2008-07-24T04:21:00.000Z	nickrud	mgreen	and I couldn't remember what it was called it gutsy.
