2009-03-25T02:25:00.000Z	jdizzy		So you wolter you just drag it into the theme window under preferece I just did that with a tar it said it installed and it was in there but did not work
2009-03-25T02:26:00.000Z	jdizzy	wolter	download the one that says ubuntu
2009-03-25T02:26:00.000Z	wolter	jdizzy	yes, its an installer
2009-03-25T02:27:00.000Z	jdizzy		Ahh thats a tar too
2009-03-25T02:27:00.000Z	wolter	jdizzy	don't drag that one.
2009-03-25T02:27:00.000Z	wolter	jdizzy	you have to extract it and run a script. Its a really nice script. It will permit you to update the theme whenever it is possible.
2009-03-25T02:27:00.000Z	wolter		I updated mine some days ago.
2009-03-25T02:28:00.000Z	wolter		hey fabio
