2005-07-27T05:50:00.000Z	coolkev		i see
2005-07-27T05:50:00.000Z	coolkev		the reason why I'm on linux is because i have no money to bguy and operate windows
2005-07-27T05:51:00.000Z	coolkev		i taught it'll keep all costs down and now i see my hd getting hot and i get scared i have no money to buy new
2005-07-27T05:51:00.000Z	coolkev		where in ubuntu i go to turn off harddisk after a while of being idle
2005-07-27T05:52:00.000Z	coolkev		also having low ram also casue harddisk to be used more?
2005-07-27T05:53:00.000Z	coolkev		i did that lsfo thingy and it show a bunch of stuff... what am i looking for?
2005-07-27T05:55:00.000Z	coolkev		also everytime i open limewire my comp runs extra slow and i see in system monitor java is using around 300 mb memory

2005-07-27T05:56:00.000Z	coolkev		that doesn't hog my ram
2005-07-27T05:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	coolkev	 dozens of them.
2005-07-27T05:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	coolkev	 thats the 'definitive' orginal client.
2005-07-27T06:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	coolkev	 that would be my guess
2005-11-05T11:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	coolkev	 every time someone comes in here wanting to do somthing like that - its because they dont know the 'better' way to fix whatever their real problem is.
2005-11-05T11:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	coolkev	 you mean you want to login to X as root. not just run a specific program as root?
2005-11-05T11:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	coolkev	 and THE ubuntu guys logic is "we spent a lot of time so you DONT have to do that" :P is what they are getting at.
2005-11-05T11:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	coolkev	 so they wan tto know what you are possibially doing that needs to do it..
2005-11-05T11:21:00.000Z	coolkev	Dr_Willis	I need to do it, can you help me or tell me or no?
2005-11-05T11:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	coolkev	 GDM is set to prevent root logging in that way also.
2005-11-05T11:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	coolkev	 kill GDM. go to console.. login as user. sudo  startx   - may do it.. or just set a root password.
2005-11-05T11:22:00.000Z	coolkev	Dr_Willis	how can i overwrite this, like i don't understand other linux distro's allow this funtion, why is ubuntu set up to prevent users from doing this, i don't ehre alot of dumb ass out there but soemtimes people need to login as root for their own personal needs
