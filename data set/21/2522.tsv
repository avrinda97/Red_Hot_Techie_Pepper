2009-09-17T15:49:00.000Z	Burning_aces		hi there, i was wondering if there is a way to move a terminal file to /usr/bin
2009-09-17T15:50:00.000Z	BlackFate	Burning_aces	you can with sudo, but not recommended... you can make a bin folder to your home dir
2009-09-17T15:50:00.000Z	BlackFate	Burning_aces	and execute globally your scripts from the specific user
2009-09-17T15:50:00.000Z	Burning_aces	BlackFate	its the cowpatty executable
2009-09-17T15:51:00.000Z	BlackFate	Burning_aces	if you put it inside ~/bin you wont have to cd
2009-09-17T15:51:00.000Z	BlackFate	Burning_aces	its like /usr/bin but for only this user
2009-09-17T15:52:00.000Z	BlackFate	Burning_aces	you can copy it or you can link it
2009-09-17T15:53:00.000Z	BlackFate	Burning_aces	first mkdir ~/bin
2009-09-17T15:53:00.000Z	BlackFate	Burning_aces	then copy youfile ~/bin
2009-09-17T15:53:00.000Z	BlackFate	Burning_aces	cp /dir/file ~/bin
2009-09-17T15:55:00.000Z	Burning_aces	BlackFate	mitch@ubuntu:~$ cp /home/mitch/cowpatty-4.3/cowpatty ~/bin
2009-09-17T15:55:00.000Z	BlackFate	Burning_aces	damn.. there is problem.. you need to set the path.. never mid..
2009-09-17T15:55:00.000Z	BlackFate	Burning_aces	sudo su
2009-09-17T15:56:00.000Z	BlackFate	Burning_aces	and then   cp /home/mitch/cowpatty-4.3/cowpatty /usr/bin
2009-09-17T15:56:00.000Z	Burning_aces	BlackFate	thank you
2009-09-17T15:56:00.000Z	BlackFate	Burning_aces	dont forget to clean up ~/bin
2009-09-17T15:57:00.000Z	BlackFate	Burning_aces	rm -rf ~/bin
2009-09-17T15:57:00.000Z	Burning_aces	BlackFate	why?
2009-09-17T15:57:00.000Z	BlackFate	Burning_aces	you dont need it :P
2009-09-17T15:57:00.000Z	BlackFate	Burning_aces	np
