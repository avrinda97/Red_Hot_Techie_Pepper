2010-12-17T10:20:00.000Z	Lanlost		this whole thing makes sense now
2010-12-17T10:20:00.000Z	Lanlost		damn ad that popped up
2010-12-17T10:21:00.000Z	Lanlost		oh my god
2010-12-17T10:21:00.000Z	Lanlost		Then configure the NAT as follows:  # iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o ethX -j MASQUERADE
2010-12-17T10:22:00.000Z	Lanlost		... then they put "where ethX is the network card that the Internet is coming from" below that
2010-12-17T10:22:00.000Z	Lanlost		so great. I just did eth0 again.. which is the one that connects the two together
2010-12-17T10:22:00.000Z	Lanlost		I meant to do usb.. how do I undo the "iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE" line
2010-12-17T10:23:00.000Z	Lanlost		sarcarlson, My wireless card is rt2500 (thats the module). The drivers are HORRIBLE and have been for at least 5 years. It does this thing where you connect, you get INCREDIBLE speeds.. lets say 800kbps. Then anywhere from 5seconds to 2 minutes later.. it drops to around 30kbps
2010-12-17T10:23:00.000Z	Lanlost		even though it still says its got a 52mbps connection or whatever. The second you reconnect. BAM it's great speed again.
2010-12-17T10:24:00.000Z	Lanlost		It doesn't do it in Windows. I tried using Windows drivers via ndiswrapper (sad I know) and.. it seemed to work but they were so unstable it was impossible to use
2010-12-17T10:24:00.000Z	lapion	Lanlost	please check:http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/LinuxTutorialNetworking.html#FORWARDING
2010-12-17T10:24:00.000Z	lapion	Lanlost	it is realy easy under linux
2010-12-17T10:25:00.000Z	Lanlost		Anyway, the reason you see my wifi connection as USB is funny.. I'm using my old Android G1 to connect to my wifi because of said wifi card problems .. and then using tethering to share it to my pc heh
2010-12-17T10:25:00.000Z	Lanlost	apapousek	who said anything about Ubuntu being Windows?
2010-12-17T10:25:00.000Z	Lanlost		I take that as Ubuntu != Windows.
2010-12-17T10:25:00.000Z	Lanlost		Just because Ubuntu != Windows doesn't mean that Windows doesn't have ANY strengths?
2010-12-17T10:26:00.000Z	Lanlost		I would be using Windows if I thought that much better about it. I haven't used Windows even as a dual boot since.. Windows 2000
2010-12-17T10:26:00.000Z	Lanlost		And.. Windows isn't what makes it 'easy.' I never claimed that. I said the Windows drivers happen to be good.
2010-12-17T10:26:00.000Z	Lanlost		usb plug
2010-12-17T10:27:00.000Z	Lanlost		what's going on with floodbot?
2010-12-17T10:27:00.000Z	lapion	Lanlost	pls do me a favour way before windows even had the driver linux had it built in the regular networking.
