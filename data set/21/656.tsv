2011-10-15T07:30:00.000Z	RingZer0		I'm really bummed out, I was hoping ubuntu would work for me and my nvidia... 32 bit gave me a kernal panic booting from CD, the 64 bit on a different laptop seemed to work, but everything that displays in X just creates a black shadow and nothing is clickable... I went through ctrl+alt+F1 (tty) to wget nvidia drivers, but you need to run via desktop env or it wont work, talk about chicken vs egg.
2011-10-15T07:32:00.000Z	RingZer0		any thoughts on how I can get my desktop env working?  just really really slow, can't start anything, and freezes on each click.
2011-10-15T07:32:00.000Z	arghx	RingZer0	disable optimus, at least for installing. then look into vgaswitcheroo
2011-10-15T07:33:00.000Z	RingZer0	arghx	thanks for responding.  install went great.  but when it boots, the desktop environment just freezes when clicking on anythying
2011-10-15T07:33:00.000Z	RingZer0	arghx	even if i could get a keyboard command to start a terminal window inside the desktop environment, I could run the driver package for nvidia
2011-10-15T07:34:00.000Z	arghx	RingZer0	ctrl+alt+f1 and install it there.
2011-10-15T07:35:00.000Z	RingZer0	arghx	thanks ... how do i restart X after install?
2011-10-15T07:36:00.000Z	arghx	RingZer0	not totally sure since gdm uses upstart :(
2011-10-15T07:37:00.000Z	arghx	RingZer0	service gdm stop  I guess
2011-10-15T07:37:00.000Z	RingZer0	arghx	thats cool, worst case snario i can just do : shutdown -r now
2011-10-15T07:46:00.000Z	arghx	RingZer0	yes. and bumblebee is unsupported 3rd party software
2011-10-15T08:10:00.000Z	arghx	RingZer0	as you can see: yes
2011-10-15T08:10:00.000Z	RingZer0	arghx	what do you mean "as i can see"

2011-10-15T08:11:00.000Z	RingZer0	arghx	what version a package is..
2011-10-15T08:11:00.000Z	arghx	RingZer0	that it installs this version? apt-cache policy php5  for example
2011-10-15T08:12:00.000Z	arghx	RingZer0	dpkg -l <package> if it's already installed. apt-cache show <package> if it isn't yet
