2011-02-08T23:49:00.000Z	m4rtin	jpiccolo	have you looked in the auth log?
2011-02-08T23:49:00.000Z	m4rtin	jpiccolo	it often gives information about permission problems that will stop ssh login (such as homedir not owned by user)
2011-02-08T23:50:00.000Z	jpiccolo	m4rtin	thats in /var/log right? i don't have a auth log there
2011-02-08T23:51:00.000Z	m4rtin	jpiccolo	 /var/log/auth.log
2011-02-08T23:51:00.000Z	jpiccolo	m4rtin	yeah thats not there
2011-02-08T23:52:00.000Z	m4rtin	jpiccolo	errr, if you don't have auth.log there, there's bigger issues with your install than ssh not working ;)

2011-02-08T23:58:00.000Z	jpiccolo	m4rtin	well is there a way i can install from a iso?
2011-02-08T23:59:00.000Z	m4rtin	jpiccolo	is this on a VPS, did you say?
2011-02-09T00:00:00.000Z	jpiccolo	m4rtin	yes,  hypervm - i have a couple options for os install,  I have tried all 4 of the ubuntu ones and i continue to have the same problems
2011-02-09T00:00:00.000Z	m4rtin	jpiccolo	do the debug procedure jrib just suggested, which will certainly help

2011-02-09T00:10:00.000Z	m4rtin	jpiccolo	if you stop the ssh daemon and don't run the server from console, do you definitely get connection refused from the client
2011-02-09T00:10:00.000Z	m4rtin	jpiccolo	because that log file shows no incoming connections
2011-02-09T00:13:00.000Z	m4rtin	jpiccolo	really stupid question... you are connecting to the right host?
2011-02-09T00:13:00.000Z	m4rtin	jpiccolo	yes, it should
2011-02-09T00:14:00.000Z	m4rtin	jpiccolo	hahahaha
2011-02-09T00:15:00.000Z	m4rtin	jpiccolo	easy to do with ssh; I was on the wrong host and did a "sudo shutdown -r now"; and then heard my server rebooting
2011-02-09T00:16:00.000Z	jpiccolo	m4rtin	well at least i got it now
2011-02-09T00:16:00.000Z	m4rtin	jpiccolo	:)
2011-02-09T00:17:00.000Z	m4rtin	jpiccolo	np
