2006-12-28T13:59:00.000Z	dmc_		sudo gedit /usr/share/applications/Nessus.desktop          it just hangs after typing in terminal, any suggestions?
2006-12-28T14:00:00.000Z	arrenlex	dmc_	You should be using gtksu for gui apps.
2006-12-28T14:00:00.000Z	dmc_	arrenlex	how would i go about that?
2006-12-28T14:00:00.000Z	arrenlex	dmc_	About what? xD
2006-12-28T14:01:00.000Z	arrenlex	dmc_	Oh. I'm tired.
2006-12-28T14:01:00.000Z	arrenlex	dmc_	gtksu gedit whateverfileitwas
2006-12-28T14:01:00.000Z	dmc_	arrenlex	using gtksu?
2006-12-28T14:02:00.000Z	arrenlex	dmc_	Okay, so the final word is: "gksudo gedit whateverfileitwas"
2006-12-28T14:03:00.000Z	dmc_	arrenlex	after i type that it should open a gedit window correct?
2006-12-28T14:03:00.000Z	arrenlex	dmc_	Yes.
2006-12-28T14:04:00.000Z	dmc_	arrenlex	its not doin that for some reason, any thoughts?
2006-12-28T14:04:00.000Z	arrenlex	dmc_	Nope. You might try rebooting. Weird things have happened to me before that rebooting fixed.

2006-12-28T14:06:00.000Z	arrenlex	dmc_	Sounds like your sudo is set up improperly. Have you touched the config? Can you run simple commands with sudo? "sudo echo hi"?
2006-12-28T14:06:00.000Z	dmc_	arrenlex	thats after typing gksudo gedit /usr/share/applications/Nessus.desktop
2006-12-28T14:06:00.000Z	dmc_	arrenlex	echo worked
2006-12-28T14:07:00.000Z	arrenlex	dmc_	I don't know, sorry. Again, you might try rebooting. Sometimes it magically fixes things.
2007-01-01T08:42:00.000Z	dmc_	arrenlex	how would i go about installing KDE?
2007-01-01T08:43:00.000Z	arrenlex	dmc_	KDE the desktop environment? KDE the application suite? Or Kubuntu the Linux distribution?
2007-01-01T08:43:00.000Z	dmc_	arrenlex	just the desktop
2007-01-01T08:43:00.000Z	arrenlex	dmc_	apt-get install kde-core
