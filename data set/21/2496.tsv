2010-04-12T12:52:00.000Z	eto		hello
2010-04-12T12:52:00.000Z	eto		useful advice only
2010-04-12T12:52:00.000Z	eto		http://www.ubuntugeek.com/remmina-remote-desktop-client.html will this work on ubuntu 8.10 and 8.04 ?
2010-04-12T12:53:00.000Z	eto		i have lager 8.04 - 8.10 installation base
2010-04-12T12:55:00.000Z	Gnea	eto	my guess would be no, as well.
2010-04-12T12:55:00.000Z	Gnea	eto	the people who wrote the software explicitly tell you what it's supported on
2010-04-12T12:56:00.000Z	eto	Gnea	: okay they don't seem to have fnode channel
2010-04-12T12:56:00.000Z	Gnea	eto	you could try adding the ppa and installing and see what happens - it might work, it might not. that's really the fastest and most reliable way to find out for sure.
2010-04-12T12:58:00.000Z	Gnea	eto	just follow the directions for 9.04 by adding the line for jaunty and then updating the key
2010-04-12T13:07:00.000Z	Gnea	eto	well, that confirms it then.
2010-04-12T13:07:00.000Z	eto	Gnea	: what do you mean by that?
2010-04-12T13:08:00.000Z	Gnea	eto	it means that the ppa won't work with 8.10 or 8.04
2010-04-12T13:09:00.000Z	Gnea	eto	you could download the source and compile it and hope that it works
2010-04-12T13:09:00.000Z	Gnea	eto	but you say you are very new, so maybe that's too much for you
2010-04-12T13:10:00.000Z	eto	Gnea	: i did some compiling with ports on free bsd and openbsd, i use codeblocks on windows and nmake for my projects
2010-04-12T13:11:00.000Z	Gnea	eto	alright then, http://sourceforge.net/projects/remmina/
2010-04-12T13:11:00.000Z	Gnea	eto	that page can help you get your build environment setup
2010-04-12T13:12:00.000Z	Gnea	eto	and sorry, most users tend to not know the difference between a c file and a header file
2010-04-12T13:14:00.000Z	eto	Gnea	: yep that might be true
2010-04-12T13:15:00.000Z	Gnea	eto	not really. I usually wait for the error to spring up, then I search for the library in another terminal and then install the -dev portion of it
2010-04-12T13:34:00.000Z	eto	Gnea	theadmin well i installed all the packages mentioned in wiki build-essentials and all in remnia readme
