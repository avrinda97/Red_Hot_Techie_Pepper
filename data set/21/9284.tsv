2011-11-23T12:59:00.000Z	sebest		Only some key packages are needed like the kernel and mysql for example on a db server
2011-11-23T13:00:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	sebest	Are you saying you want to be able to upgrade the kernel and mysql without upgrading the rest?
2011-11-23T13:00:00.000Z	sebest	tonyyarusso	yes
2011-11-23T13:00:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	sebest	How come?
2011-11-23T13:01:00.000Z	sebest	tonyyarusso	i don t really care to have a old version of ps, ls and so on
2011-11-23T13:02:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	sebest	In English, "don't care to" actually means "do not want to" - I think you mean "I don't care *if* I have an old version of ps, ls, and so on".
2011-11-23T13:02:00.000Z	sebest	tonyyarusso	sorry :) but you get the  point
2011-11-23T13:02:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	sebest	Why do you need the upgrades to the kernel and mysql though?  Trying to understand the business case here.
2011-11-23T13:03:00.000Z	sebest	tonyyarusso	only for performance and features, like new hardware or improved performance in mysql
2011-11-23T13:04:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	sebest	Okay, but if you're upgrading major system components, what's the reason *not* to upgrade the little stuff?
2011-11-23T13:04:00.000Z	sebest	tonyyarusso	let s say you are a big LAMP shop, the only package we really care about are L A M P
2011-11-23T13:05:00.000Z	sebest	tonyyarusso	because it is a lot of trouble to upgrade from on LTS to another, a lot of things change, for example upstart
2011-11-23T13:05:00.000Z	sebest	tonyyarusso	upstart is useless for us and only gives us new issues
2011-11-23T13:05:00.000Z	sebest	tonyyarusso	the little things gives you a lot of little issues
2011-11-23T13:06:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	sebest	I guess that makes some sense.  Are you able to get the packages you need from the backports repository?
2011-11-23T13:07:00.000Z	sebest	tonyyarusso	most of the time we backport them ourselves
2011-11-23T13:08:00.000Z	sebest	tonyyarusso	storing them on an internal reprepro
2011-11-23T13:08:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	sebest	Okay, but do you have to?  If they're already in backports then the functionality you're describing is already available.
2011-11-23T13:08:00.000Z	sebest	tonyyarusso	there is no 2.6.38 kernel for karmic or mysql/mariadb/percona 5.5
2011-11-23T13:09:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	sebest	Um, of course not.  Karmic is EOL.  There isn't anything for it.
2011-11-23T13:10:00.000Z	sebest	tonyyarusso	the same for lucid
