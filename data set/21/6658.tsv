2007-02-24T10:56:00.000Z	loz		Phazor: are you sure about those links?
2007-02-24T10:56:00.000Z	Phasor	loz	Pretty sure, why?
2007-02-24T10:57:00.000Z	loz	Phasor	one does not work, and the other is weird, about small buisness etc?

2007-02-24T10:57:00.000Z	loz	Phasor	or am i being dumb?

2007-02-24T10:59:00.000Z	Phasor	loz	Go to http://www.majorgeeks.com/download181.html and click on the MajorGeeks EU link. You should then start to download a ZIP file.
2007-02-24T10:59:00.000Z	loz	Phasor	is this for flashing the Motherboard?
2007-02-24T11:00:00.000Z	Phasor	loz	No, just for determining which motherboard you have
2007-02-24T11:01:00.000Z	Phasor	loz	Actually, it looks like I have found a better guide than me about flashing the BIOS, look at http://www.pcnineoneone.com/howto/biosflash1.html
2007-02-24T11:01:00.000Z	Phasor	loz	I have to go now anyway. Sorry
2007-02-24T11:02:00.000Z	loz	Phasor	Thanks for the help
