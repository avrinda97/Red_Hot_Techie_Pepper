2005-03-06T16:29:00.000Z	FR500		hi
2005-03-06T16:29:00.000Z	FR500		does gdesklets work in ubuntu
2005-03-06T16:29:00.000Z	FR500		?
2005-03-06T16:30:00.000Z	topyli	FR500	sure, as far as they work at all
2005-03-06T16:31:00.000Z	FR500	topyli	what do you mean? and it doesnt even start for me
2005-03-06T16:32:00.000Z	topyli	FR500	i mean they are resource hungry bastards anyway. but you have to first start it, and then actually load a few displays to see anything
2005-03-06T16:33:00.000Z	topyli	FR500	it may well be running, but you don't have any displays activated
2005-03-06T16:36:00.000Z	topyli	FR500	i don't have it installed but should be somewhere like /usr/share/gdesklets/displays
2005-03-06T16:37:00.000Z	topyli	FR500	don't remember. if you right click them, they have an option to "run with gdesklets" or something
2005-05-05T10:43:00.000Z	topyli	FR500	dunno, but many livecds have nice consoles
2005-05-05T11:51:00.000Z	topyli	FR500	calm down, boot from something, run fsck
2005-05-05T11:53:00.000Z	topyli	FR500	yes, and "hope for the best" means "check moon phase and wave a dead chicken on the keyboard"
2005-05-05T11:53:00.000Z	FR500	topyli	what?
2005-05-05T11:53:00.000Z	topyli	FR500	in other words, "pray" :)
2005-05-05T12:02:00.000Z	FR500	topyli	Delph thanks a lot
2005-05-05T12:05:00.000Z	topyli	FR500	good. ext3 is hard to break with a power failure :)
2005-05-05T12:06:00.000Z	FR500	topyli	being ubuntu my only os now it was scary for once
2005-05-05T12:06:00.000Z	topyli	FR500	sure. because for a minute you don't know how badly broken the filesystem is. it may be genuinely gone
2005-10-08T12:49:00.000Z	topyli	FR500	it has 2.12
2005-10-08T12:53:00.000Z	FR500	topyli	which is actually good
2005-10-08T12:53:00.000Z	topyli	FR500	of course. a user cannot know if another user wants a menu item or not
