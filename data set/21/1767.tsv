2010-11-25T01:33:00.000Z	_jesse_	ubuntunoobz	you can do `iwlist ra0 scanning` to see percentages for all networks
2010-11-25T01:33:00.000Z	_jesse_	ubuntunoobz	replacing 'ra0' with oyur wifi interface
2010-11-25T01:34:00.000Z	_jesse_	ubuntunoobz	are you sure you supplied the correct name? your wifi interface should support scanning :P
2010-11-25T01:35:00.000Z	_jesse_	ubuntunoobz	you can actually just leave the inteface out and do `iwlist scanning` to see it all
2010-11-25T01:37:00.000Z	_jesse_	ubuntunoobz	`iwlist scanning` shows it to you, it's under 'Quality'
2010-11-25T01:39:00.000Z	_jesse_	ubuntunoobz	I see, I can't think of anything like that off the top of my head
2010-11-25T01:40:00.000Z	_jesse_	ubuntunoobz	yeah I understand that, the best I can do is just to say move it and run the command, move and run the command :P
2010-11-25T01:41:00.000Z	_jesse_	ubuntunoobz	that sort of thing is so dynamic that the wifi card doesn't instantly know
2010-11-25T01:44:00.000Z	_jesse_	ubuntunoobz	I think he was trying to talk to Ubuntuguy and tab completed wrong
2010-11-25T01:49:00.000Z	_jesse_	ubuntunoobz	it isn't, I told you how! You can probably find a gnome-panel applet too
