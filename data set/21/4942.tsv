2008-10-30T14:57:00.000Z	carl_		hi guys, i have a server that is running dapper, and i want to install a newer version of php, what is the best "ubuntu" way to do this?
2008-10-30T14:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	carl_	search synaptic is one way. there is no "best" anything
2008-10-30T14:59:00.000Z	carl_	ActionParsnip	thing is that the version in the rep is way old
2008-10-30T14:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	carl_	then find a repo with a newer version or install a .deb file manually
2009-04-06T01:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	carl_	try:    file <file you are curious of>
2009-04-06T01:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	carl_	it may tell you
2009-04-06T01:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	carl_	http://www.fileinfo.com/extension/fdf
2009-04-06T01:09:00.000Z	carl_	ActionParsnip	So, I need acrobat reader?  Or what?
2009-04-06T01:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	carl_	wekk, any PDF reader will do
2009-04-06T01:12:00.000Z	carl_	ActionParsnip	The link shows only Mac and MS Windows...  But I'm trying to open the link with xpdf and nothing's happening.
2009-04-06T01:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	carl_	well if you install adobes pdf viewer (not open source) on your system, you have as good as a windows user
2009-04-06T01:14:00.000Z	carl_	ActionParsnip	Ok, will do that
2010-12-18T05:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	carl_	what is the output of: sudo apt-get update    plase use: http://pastie.org to give the output
2010-12-18T05:33:00.000Z	carl_	ActionParsnip	http://pastie.org/1386277
2010-12-18T05:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	carl_	ok then run: sudo apt-get -y upgrade    is it ok?
2010-12-18T05:37:00.000Z	carl_	ActionParsnip	you think that will fix the 'issue' ?
2011-07-26T03:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	carl_	look in ccsm
2011-07-26T03:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	carl_	config ;)
2011-07-26T03:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	carl_	is the hdmi enabled in BIOS?
2011-07-26T03:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	carl_	if you boot with just the HDMI attached, do you get any display?
2011-10-03T04:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	carl_	that's not a package
