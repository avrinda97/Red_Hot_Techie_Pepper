2006-05-16T12:04:00.000Z	Spec	Old	yeap, that .sh looks good
2006-05-16T12:04:00.000Z	Spec	Old	if you want to './cs1', put it in your home directory
2006-05-16T12:04:00.000Z	Spec	Old	if you want to type $ cs1, whever you are, put it in a folder that's in your PATH, type: echo $PATH   to see your $PATH
2006-05-16T12:08:00.000Z	Spec	Old	You should specify the full path to hlds_run if you wish to execute that script wherever you are
2006-05-16T12:08:00.000Z	Spec	Old	you can put the .sh files in /usr/local/bin if you want to run them wherever you are
2006-05-16T12:09:00.000Z	Spec	Old	is it in your home directory?
2006-05-16T12:10:00.000Z	Old	Spec	/home/cs1

2006-05-16T12:11:00.000Z	Spec	Old	hlds_run is an executable, and it sits in the folder /home/cs1?
2006-05-16T12:12:00.000Z	Old	Spec	I run ./hlds_run when i am in the dir /home/cs1
2006-05-16T12:12:00.000Z	Spec	Old	okay, then the command I gave you above is correct
