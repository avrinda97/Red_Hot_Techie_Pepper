2012-06-03T18:59:00.000Z	intore		hi, am using ubuntu 11.10 and i have 2 problems. the first one: i use pam_mount to mount user's home directory locally on the client and it runs but it doesn't umount it: "device is busy" and i don't understand why. could you help me please?
2012-06-03T19:00:00.000Z	DasEi	intore	possibly you or an app is accesing it ? to be cd'ed in is enough
2012-06-03T19:04:00.000Z	intore	DasEi	i checked with fuser but there aren't. could create problems without umounting the directory?
2012-06-03T19:05:00.000Z	DasEi	intore	yes, or if a user is still in that dir
2012-06-03T19:06:00.000Z	intore	DasEi	the logout runs ok and another can't access to another home.
2012-06-03T19:07:00.000Z	DasEi	intore	lsof of it ?
2012-06-03T19:07:00.000Z	intore	DasEi	of that dir?
2012-06-03T19:12:00.000Z	DasEi	intore	so still open files on it ?
2012-06-03T19:12:00.000Z	intore	DasEi	no
2012-06-03T19:13:00.000Z	intore	DasEi	i don't understand. now umounting runs
2012-06-03T19:14:00.000Z	DasEi	intore	maybe a caching ?
2012-06-03T19:15:00.000Z	intore	DasEi	maybe. am working on shell, login and logout from shell. i'll check next days
2012-06-03T19:15:00.000Z	intore	DasEi	thanks anyway
2012-06-03T19:17:00.000Z	intore	DasEi	ah, a strange behavior of ubuntu with ssh. remote halt command doesn't completely shutdown, locally halt runs ok, why?!?!?
2012-06-03T19:18:00.000Z	DasEi	intore	ss'ed as root ? I can shutdown -h over ssh
2012-06-03T19:21:00.000Z	intore	DasEi	yes as root
2012-06-03T19:22:00.000Z	DasEi	intore	idk then , works fine here
2012-06-03T19:23:00.000Z	intore	DasEi	what is idk?
2012-06-03T19:23:00.000Z	DasEi	intore	I don't know
2012-06-03T19:23:00.000Z	intore	DasEi	ahahahh, well i tried as command!!!
