2007-08-17T12:29:00.000Z	WindsofTime		&&Help&& I installed Linux onto my HD, not I would like to  put windows on another Partition..when I went to install Windows it said unknown harddrive!.. I would like to "break a piece" off of my Linux Partition *which is the whole harddrive* and give it to windows..can this be done without a reformat???

2007-08-17T12:30:00.000Z	shiester_miester	WindsofTime	are the windows and linux partitions on physically separate drives?
2007-08-17T12:30:00.000Z	WindsofTime	shiester_miester	sorry..Its on one harddrive..one partition..linux is the only OS right now.. I would like to break a piece off of Linux's partition and give it to windows to use.. its this possible?
2007-08-17T12:31:00.000Z	shiester_miester	WindsofTime	you dont "Break" a partition :P you resize them
2007-08-17T12:31:00.000Z	shiester_miester	WindsofTime	and yes, you can resize the linux partition so that windows has more room to play with
2007-08-17T12:31:00.000Z	shiester_miester	WindsofTime	although installing windows will make you unable to boot into linux
2007-08-17T12:32:00.000Z	WindsofTime	shiester_miester	why?
2007-08-17T12:32:00.000Z	shiester_miester	WindsofTime	because windows only tolerates booting alongside other versions of windows (and maybe a few other OSs, certainly not linux)
2007-08-17T12:32:00.000Z	shiester_miester	WindsofTime	if you install linux after you install windows then yes you can
2007-08-17T12:37:00.000Z	shiester_miester	WindsofTime	once you install windows, you will have to put grub back onto the mbr.  grub tolerates windows, windows doesn't tolerate anything else
2007-08-17T12:38:00.000Z	WindsofTime	shiester_miester	can this be done without the risk of losing anything from Linux?
2007-08-17T12:39:00.000Z	shiester_miester	WindsofTime	yes, the linux partition shouldn't be touched at all
2007-08-17T12:39:00.000Z	shiester_miester	WindsofTime	but linux's boot loader will be removed
2007-08-17T12:39:00.000Z	WindsofTime	shiester_miester	So how do I restore it and save my info and my linux?
2007-08-17T12:40:00.000Z	shiester_miester	WindsofTime	not entirely sure, I've never done it.  I don't believe its too difficult though
2007-08-17T12:41:00.000Z	shiester_miester	WindsofTime	someone does, try asking the channel later
2007-08-17T12:41:00.000Z	WindsofTime	shiester_miester	sadly I dont have that much time =\
2007-08-17T12:42:00.000Z	shiester_miester	WindsofTime	thats unfortunate
2007-08-17T12:42:00.000Z	shiester_miester	WindsofTime	probably
2007-08-17T12:49:00.000Z	WindsofTime	shiester_miester	I found something ^^
