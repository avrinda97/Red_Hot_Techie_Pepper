2009-06-22T10:28:00.000Z	samir_		or there's a shortcut by apt-get to do it?
2009-06-22T10:30:00.000Z	samir_		guys, i just wanna downgrade my kernel to 2.6.26*, so i just have to install linux-image-2.6.26*.deb ??
2009-06-22T10:31:00.000Z	samir_		sure
2009-06-22T10:31:00.000Z	samir_		just to say (every version of 2.6.26)
2009-06-22T10:31:00.000Z	samir_		i'll not say that to bash =D
2009-06-22T10:32:00.000Z	n2diy	samir_	LF4, ? is a better choice than -
2009-06-22T10:35:00.000Z	n2diy	samir_	that depends, apt-get and synaptic will hanle the dependiences for you, if you use other means to get the kernel, you are on your own.
2009-06-22T10:36:00.000Z	samir_	n2diy	: i get it, but, there's some way to do a kernel downgrade by that tools?
2009-06-22T10:37:00.000Z	n2diy	samir_	is this a test box, or a mission critical box?
2009-06-22T10:37:00.000Z	samir_	n2diy	: my box, no problem =)
2009-06-22T10:38:00.000Z	samir_	n2diy	: if something messes up, no problem at all
2009-06-22T10:39:00.000Z	n2diy	samir_	umm, ok. The only way "I" know how to do that would be google for old Ubuntu isos, and try installing one of them?
2009-06-22T10:40:00.000Z	samir_	n2diy	: no way to do that, if i get by the repos the old versions of the packages i need and install? i think it handle all the grub thing and etc
2009-06-22T10:43:00.000Z	n2diy	samir_	you can't burn CD's?
2009-06-22T10:44:00.000Z	samir_	n2diy	: i can't convince myself to reinstall the entire OS to get a kernel exchange =(
2009-06-22T10:45:00.000Z	n2diy	samir_	10-4, and I don' know any other way to do it.
2009-06-22T10:45:00.000Z	n2diy	samir_	10-4, and I don' know any other way to do it.
2009-06-22T10:46:00.000Z	samir_	n2diy	: i'll try that .deb thing, report back in some minutes =)
2009-06-22T10:49:00.000Z	samir_	n2diy	: what a dumb i am!! #apt-cache search linux-image-2.6.25
2009-06-22T10:50:00.000Z	n2diy	samir_	cool, but save the laughs for when it is "running"! Gl.
