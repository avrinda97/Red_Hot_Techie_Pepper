2006-04-22T05:49:00.000Z	mzinz		I'm using breezy badger on a i386 laptop with kernel 2.6... is this the newest kernel?
2006-04-22T05:49:00.000Z	Warbo	mzinz	That is the latest stable version
2006-04-22T05:49:00.000Z	Warbo	mzinz	2.6 is the latest Linux version, but 2.6.16 is the VERY latest
2006-04-22T05:50:00.000Z	mzinz	Warbo	any clue when a new 'big release will come out?
2006-04-22T05:50:00.000Z	Warbo	mzinz	June I think. I'm using it now
2006-04-22T05:50:00.000Z	mzinz	Warbo	how do i get 2.6.16? and is it worth it for such a small update
2006-04-22T05:50:00.000Z	mzinz	Warbo	Ubuntu employee?
2006-04-22T05:50:00.000Z	Warbo	mzinz	Well 2.6.16 is actually a very major update, but isn't really worth it
2006-04-22T05:51:00.000Z	mzinz	Warbo	ohh i see.
2006-04-22T05:51:00.000Z	Warbo	mzinz	Ubuntu is a Linux distro. Canonical is the company, and I;m just a regular user like you
2006-04-22T05:51:00.000Z	mzinz	Warbo	specifically I'm trying to get "real" drivers for my WNIC... instead of ndiswrapper.  Is there a chance that would be on the kernel?
2006-04-22T05:52:00.000Z	mzinz	Warbo	sorry haha.  I asked because I thought you meant you had an advance on the update coming out in June
2006-04-22T05:52:00.000Z	mzinz	Warbo	;)
2006-04-22T05:52:00.000Z	Warbo	mzinz	Well if you look in /lib/modules/(your kernel) then you may find some drivers. Google around to see what they are (they are well organised). If there is one for you then you are laughing, but I doubt that 2.6.16 will them if 2.6.12 doesn't
2006-04-22T05:53:00.000Z	Warbo	mzinz	I'll look there in mine (but I'm in a 2.6.15-18 kernel) but I don't really know what I'm looking for
2006-04-24T14:39:00.000Z	Warbo	mzinz	Amarok has all the features you could want, but takes loads of memory
2006-04-24T14:40:00.000Z	Warbo	mzinz	Amarok includes loads of plying enginges and output plugins, it has built in AidioScrobbler and last.fm, Amazon covers, Wikipedia info on bands, Musicbrainz ID3 info, etc.
2006-04-24T14:41:00.000Z	mzinz	Warbo	oh wow
2006-04-24T14:41:00.000Z	Warbo	mzinz	Is that sarcastic, or genuine?
2006-04-24T14:41:00.000Z	mzinz	Warbo	no i meant it
2006-04-24T14:41:00.000Z	Warbo	mzinz	:)
