2008-02-07T08:44:00.000Z	midgetnat		i can connect locally but cannot do it remotely
2008-02-07T08:45:00.000Z	midgetnat		checked the iptables and everything is fine
2008-02-07T08:45:00.000Z	midgetnat		the remote computer has access to it
2008-02-07T08:45:00.000Z	nepbabu	midgetnat	poke a hole in your fw
2008-02-07T08:45:00.000Z	midgetnat		but it is on the same network
2008-02-07T08:45:00.000Z	nepbabu	midgetnat	so?
2008-02-07T08:46:00.000Z	midgetnat	nepbabu	called my isp and they were not blocking it
2008-02-07T08:47:00.000Z	nepbabu	midgetnat	do you use a router? i'd double check that one as well
2008-02-07T08:47:00.000Z	midgetnat		yup.. and the router is set to accept all connections to that machine
2008-02-07T08:48:00.000Z	nepbabu	midgetnat	try telnet'ing to that machine
2008-02-07T08:48:00.000Z	nepbabu	midgetnat	on that particular port
2008-02-07T08:48:00.000Z	midgetnat	nepbabu	maybe something could be happening there... checked the inetd.conf and it has some lines about sendmail and exim and i have masqmail
2008-02-07T08:48:00.000Z	nepbabu	midgetnat	no idea
2008-02-07T08:49:00.000Z	midgetnat	nepbabu	yup it says it cannot connect to it... when i restart the daemon, it says something about several smtps... but they are removed... apt-get removed them before
