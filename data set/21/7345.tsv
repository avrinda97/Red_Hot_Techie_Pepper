2006-11-30T15:45:00.000Z	firepol		hi, im planning to buy 2 computers for a very small company. they'd like to try ubuntu + openoffice for writing letters and secretary work... what hardware is more STABLE with ubuntu? an AMD Sempron, an AMD 64 or a Celeron D?
2006-11-30T15:46:00.000Z	SilentDis	firepol	 purely from a thermal prospective, i'd say the Celeron D.  if cooling is not a problem, then I'd go with the AMD 64
2006-11-30T15:47:00.000Z	SilentDis	firepol	 duh, business.  yeah, stay the heck away from 64bit cores for now rofl
2006-11-30T15:48:00.000Z	SilentDis	firepol	 computers don't do well in heat in general.  if it's an 'office' environment you're probably fine.  if it's anything else, well... that'll be based on your needs
2006-11-30T15:50:00.000Z	SilentDis	firepol	 when i build boxen for customers for businesses, i tend to stick with Intel chips for heat/reliability issues.
2006-11-30T15:50:00.000Z	firepol	SilentDis	i was thinking the same...
2006-11-30T15:50:00.000Z	SilentDis	firepol	when it's for individual users, I do go with AMD, as you'll get more 'bang for the buck'
2006-11-30T15:51:00.000Z	firepol	SilentDis	do u think a mainboard with integrated vga+lan+audio, 2 hard disks and a celeron D will work well with a 350 Watt power supply? or is better 45' watt?
2006-11-30T15:52:00.000Z	SilentDis	firepol	 you're saving yourself a bit with the integrated video, but I'd still go for at least a 400 in a box with 2 HDs in it
2006-11-30T15:52:00.000Z	firepol	SilentDis	perfect, thanks dude
2006-11-30T15:53:00.000Z	SilentDis	firepol	 when it comes to business, it's gotta be 100% uptime, period.  all safe bets :)
2006-11-30T16:00:00.000Z	SilentDis	firepol	 from a purely personal experience, I've always offered Linux as an option to businesses, even showed them the $125 savings on cost of the box, and the best I've been able to do is get them to put it on a second partition... which, of course, they never use.  if you've gotten them to agree to a Linux box in the first place, you're way ahead of me lol
2006-11-30T16:01:00.000Z	firepol	SilentDis	my strategy is to install linux and give them support. once they're used to it they should be fine
2006-11-30T16:01:00.000Z	SilentDis	firepol	 then again, *I* use the linux partition when they break it rofl
2006-11-30T16:02:00.000Z	SilentDis	firepol	 i wish you the absolute best of luck :)
2006-11-30T16:02:00.000Z	firepol	SilentDis	anyway im explaining them the benefits and costs (support)... so at the end maybe they'll buy windows anyway... i will just show them the 2 possibilities
2006-11-30T16:02:00.000Z	firepol	SilentDis	they also need a file server. for that one i'll install ubuntu or debian
2006-11-30T16:03:00.000Z	SilentDis	firepol	 oh yeah.  no way I'd recommend a MS product in that reguard.  they'll never 'see' it, and samba does so much better of a job hehe
2006-11-30T16:04:00.000Z	SilentDis	firepol	 :D
2006-11-30T16:06:00.000Z	firepol	SilentDis	the pc will be used by 2 girls. i will maybe install AIGLX and compiz, so they'll benefit some cool graphic effects and love linux for that ;)
2006-11-30T16:07:00.000Z	SilentDis	firepol	 lol Beryl always gets 'em ;)
