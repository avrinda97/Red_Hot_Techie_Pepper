2007-03-05T06:33:00.000Z	Odd_Bloke	n-iCe	If you want something crazily cut-down, Damn Small Linux perhaps. :p
2007-03-05T06:33:00.000Z	n-iCe	Odd_Bloke	 i already try it, but my usb wireless adpater doesn't work there.
2007-03-05T06:34:00.000Z	Odd_Bloke	n-iCe	Have you tried Xubuntu or not, I missed your reply in the spaff.
