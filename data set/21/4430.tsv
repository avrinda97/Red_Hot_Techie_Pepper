2008-07-26T08:34:00.000Z	rootyrooty		HI, how do I start mysql?
2008-07-26T08:36:00.000Z	rootyrooty		I need to start it then
2008-07-26T08:38:00.000Z	unop	rootyrooty	how did you restart mysql?
2008-07-26T08:39:00.000Z	rootyrooty	unop	no, haven't yet. it usually launches with mysql
2008-07-26T08:39:00.000Z	rootyrooty	unop	no, haven't yet. it usually launches with amarok
2008-07-26T08:39:00.000Z	unop	rootyrooty	err no .. mysql needs root's privs. to be started .. and amarok doesn't normally run under root.
2008-07-26T08:40:00.000Z	unop	rootyrooty	 sudo /etc/init.d/mysql restart
2008-07-26T08:40:00.000Z	rootyrooty	unop	The problem is found!:   ERROR: The partition with /var/lib/mysql is too full!
2008-07-26T08:41:00.000Z	rootyrooty	unop	my hd is full for some reason, something is malfunctioning and is fillling it up
2008-07-26T08:42:00.000Z	unop	rootyrooty	 you could find the 10 biggest files under /var or perhas /var/lib   du -a /var/lib/* | sort -rn | head -n 10
2008-07-26T08:42:00.000Z	rootyrooty	unop	am trying!
2008-07-26T08:43:00.000Z	rootyrooty	unop	I don't understand the output. It just lists directories
2008-07-26T08:44:00.000Z	rootyrooty	unop	do I delete the 10 biggest files?
2008-07-26T08:44:00.000Z	unop	rootyrooty	well, that there just lists the 10 biggest, it's upto you to decide whether or not they are needed
2008-07-26T08:46:00.000Z	rootyrooty	unop	will I destroy my system if I delete, say the gconf files? I think that they're the culprit
2008-07-26T08:48:00.000Z	unop	rootyrooty	you might lose user configuration if you delete those directories
2008-07-26T08:49:00.000Z	rootyrooty	unop	Not sure what you mean. If I delete it and reboot, will I be screwed, or just left with a large amount of user config to do, as opposed to a non-booting box?
2008-07-26T08:49:00.000Z	unop	rootyrooty	which gconf directories/files are you referring to?
2008-07-26T08:50:00.000Z	rootyrooty	unop	63744 /var/lib/gconf/defaults
2008-07-26T08:51:00.000Z	rootyrooty	unop	and /var/lib/gconf
2008-07-26T08:59:00.000Z	rootyrooty	unop	do you have an answer /poilitely asking
