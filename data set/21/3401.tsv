2009-04-24T19:55:00.000Z	Crash1hd		Woo hoo I getting a new Terrabit Drive today :)
2009-04-24T19:56:00.000Z	Crash1hd		lol :)
2009-04-24T19:56:00.000Z	Crash1hd		man there only 100$ here :)
2009-04-24T19:56:00.000Z	Crash1hd		thats the best part
2009-04-24T19:58:00.000Z	Crash1hd		Now the real question comes do I put ubuntu on the new drive or an older drive? the new drive will have a faster seek time
2009-04-24T19:58:00.000Z	Crash1hd		but is alot larger in size
2009-04-24T20:00:00.000Z	vigo	Crash1hd	Depends on your use, if Ubuntu is going to be secondary , slower, if Ubuntu is going to be used more, FAST!
2009-04-24T20:00:00.000Z	Crash1hd	vigo	I am hoping it to be my primary so I need it fast
2009-04-24T20:01:00.000Z	vigo	Crash1hd	That is the way I would set it up, Ubuntu Primary, other drive as a backup and maybe a small windows part.
2009-04-24T20:02:00.000Z	Crash1hd	vigo	any reason for the windows part?
2009-04-24T20:03:00.000Z	Crash1hd		I guess what is left is trying to figure out how to break the drive up in partitions? any ideas anyone? 1T and 350gigs (2 drives)
2009-04-24T20:03:00.000Z	vigo	Crash1hd	95% of the boxes online are running windows, it may help in diagnosing or whatever stuff. You know, helping a windows user out.
2009-04-24T20:04:00.000Z	Crash1hd	vigo	I was thinking of installing windows in vmware
2009-04-24T20:05:00.000Z	vigo	Crash1hd	You have 5g to spare for a minimal windows install and that will leave extra space for whatever, use the res of the drive as a Backup and or Storage.
2009-04-24T20:06:00.000Z	Crash1hd	vigo	so you think I should always have a 5gig ntfs partition at the front just incase I ever need it
2009-04-24T20:07:00.000Z	vigo	Crash1hd	this box is 100% GNU/Linux, but yes, I have a live CD of windows 2k. I would put Win on the slower drive, keep it clean.
2009-04-24T20:11:00.000Z	Crash1hd	vigo	Hmm would you stilll do it if I had a copy of windows on a laptop already?
2009-04-24T20:14:00.000Z	vigo	Crash1hd	I would'nt, but then again there is the licensing issue, XP is 'hooked' to the hardware, so is up to you, I personally would at least keep the XP that fits or matches that box at least handy, you never know when some friend may need help that they cannot get around or fix.
2009-04-24T20:15:00.000Z	Crash1hd	vigo	true :) now to figure out how to partition the rest though
2009-04-24T20:15:00.000Z	Crash1hd		want most of the space for storage of files IE stuff in /home/
2009-04-24T20:18:00.000Z	vigo	Crash1hd	Just full install on sda1, or FAST HD, then install custom on 2nd, then again, read the forums for the boot issues and stuff. I had no problems switching and adding HDDs to this box, when I need windows, I power off, plug a cable in, and shazzaam, dual boot , or quad boot.
