2011-06-26T09:48:00.000Z	pcypher		has anyone had luck getting 5.1 audio with the realteck drivers in 10.10?
2011-06-26T09:48:00.000Z	pcypher		sorry realtek*
2011-06-26T09:49:00.000Z	BluesKaj	pcypher	it's not so much the drivers as your alsamixer settings in the spdif ctrl
2011-06-26T09:50:00.000Z	pcypher	BluesKaj	I tried alsamixer, but it would not load.
2011-06-26T09:50:00.000Z	pcypher		Im ssh'd to my box ill grab the error... <--at work
2011-06-26T09:51:00.000Z	BluesKaj	pcypher	then install alsa-base and alsa-utils
2011-06-26T09:51:00.000Z	pcypher		well crap... now its working somehow
2011-06-26T09:52:00.000Z	pcypher	BluesKaj	I did... that was the 3rd thing I tried. 1. compile and installl drivers from realtek... - lost stereo sound.
2011-06-26T09:52:00.000Z	pcypher		then edit config to add hda intel
2011-06-26T09:52:00.000Z	pcypher		no dice
2011-06-26T09:52:00.000Z	pcypher		then removed pulse audio as suggested...
2011-06-26T09:53:00.000Z	pcypher		no dive
2011-06-26T09:53:00.000Z	pcypher		dice*
2011-06-26T09:53:00.000Z	pcypher		ill give this a shot now
2011-06-26T09:53:00.000Z	BluesKaj	pcypher	no , alsa-base and utils are the default drivers for most soundcards
2011-06-26T09:53:00.000Z	pcypher		that was the last step I tried before coming to work
2011-06-26T09:54:00.000Z	BluesKaj		!realtek | pcypher
2011-06-26T09:54:00.000Z	pcypher		BlueKaj: tried this

2011-06-26T09:55:00.000Z	pcypher		I have seen people say that back proting to lucid wll fix, but I will lose newest ati radeon drivers
2011-06-26T10:03:00.000Z	BluesKaj	pcypher	my setup uses alsa and vlc as the player . For DD and DTS digital streams are more reliant on the player settings for the spdif .look for dev-0 in your audio settings in vlc to cxapture the digital otput to your DAC
