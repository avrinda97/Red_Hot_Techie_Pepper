2008-03-26T06:36:00.000Z	xyyzzz		I know this isn't strictly a Ubuntu question, but I'd appreciate any help. I just downloaded RealPlayer10GOLD.bin, and when I double click it it asks what the best application is to open it with...
2008-03-26T06:36:00.000Z	xyyzzz		I thought a .bin was a binary, and that it would just... open...
2008-03-26T06:36:00.000Z	xyyzzz		Does anybody have any suggestions?
2008-03-26T06:37:00.000Z	brent113	xyyzzz	yuo have to set the executable permission
2008-03-26T06:45:00.000Z	xyyzzz	brent113	nikrud, Lokii-, I still get the same error... and when I tried "sh RealPlayerGOLD10.bin" it said: "cannot execute binary file"
2008-03-26T06:46:00.000Z	xyyzzz	brent113	yep. I tried it using "chmod a+x" and when that didn't work I also used "chmod 777"...
2008-03-26T06:46:00.000Z	brent113	xyyzzz	when you double click a bin with the executable set it will ask you if you want to run in terminal or display
2008-03-26T06:48:00.000Z	xyyzzz	brent113	it says "Open RealPlayer10GOLD.bin" and other files of type unknown with: "Recommended Applications: [none]" "Other Applications: [a huge list...]"
2008-03-26T06:51:00.000Z	brent113	xyyzzz	maybe this is a dumb questions, have you tried synaptec to install it?
2008-03-26T06:52:00.000Z	xyyzzz	brent113	nope, I tried apt-get and it couldn't find it... so I assumed synaptec couldn't either =/
2008-03-26T06:53:00.000Z	xyyzzz	brent113	I get "package realplayer has no installation candidate"
2008-03-26T06:56:00.000Z	brent113	xyyzzz	you could download the redhat package and alien it to a deb
2008-03-26T06:58:00.000Z	xyyzzz	brent113	How do you alien a redhat package to a deb?
2008-03-26T06:58:00.000Z	brent113	xyyzzz	it can be done, I'd focus on getting the bin to work though
2008-03-26T06:59:00.000Z	xyyzzz	brent113	Do you think it could be because I'm running Xubuntu instead of Ubuntu? Maybe Xubuntu doesn't support it...
2008-03-26T06:59:00.000Z	brent113	xyyzzz	do a md5sum [file] on that for me, and paste the output
2008-03-26T07:01:00.000Z	xyyzzz	brent113	it said: ca87acf8e0cdf928cf31ca381acf04f2 RealPlayer10Gold.bin
2008-03-26T07:01:00.000Z	brent113	xyyzzz	mmk, that's what i get to: ok, here's what I do to install it
2008-03-26T07:02:00.000Z	brent113	xyyzzz	its sitting on my desktop, I did chmod a+x, then ./Real[rest of filename]
2008-03-26T07:02:00.000Z	brent113	xyyzzz	It extracts the files and asks to continue, that's how it should work
2008-03-26T07:03:00.000Z	xyyzzz	brent113	thanks I will try that
