2008-01-17T22:59:00.000Z	marion		Is anyone able to help me get my Linksys WPC300N PCMCIA card to work on a new install?
2008-01-17T23:00:00.000Z	marion		I am seeking help to get a Linksys PCMCIA wirless card to work. Any takers?
2008-01-17T23:01:00.000Z	gerro	marion	what model I have one of those already going
2008-01-17T23:01:00.000Z	marion	gerro	Is the WPC300N
2008-01-17T23:01:00.000Z	gerro	marion	ah that's a new one don't know about it
2008-01-17T23:02:00.000Z	gerro	marion	I got my card going by installing rt2500 in synaptic
2008-01-17T23:03:00.000Z	gerro	marion	but I don't think I was using the same device as you
2008-01-17T23:03:00.000Z	marion	gerro	have you experience with util to make it work with windows drivers?
2008-01-17T23:03:00.000Z	gerro	marion	you mean ndiswrapper yeah I've setup a few machines to use that
2008-01-17T23:04:00.000Z	gerro	marion	but you should first check if you can get native drivers because the windows one doesn't support you changing many configurations without having to reload stuff its rather lame
2008-01-17T23:04:00.000Z	marion	gerro	when I ndiswrapper -l it tells me that it finds the device.
2008-01-17T23:04:00.000Z	gerro	marion	did you download latest ndiswrapper from their website and do make uninstall before compiling it?
2008-01-17T23:05:00.000Z	gerro	marion	after that just follow what is listed in the wiki at the ndiswrapper site where it lists all the cards supported
2008-01-17T23:05:00.000Z	gerro	marion	your system might already be using a driver though if you do lshw as root and it doesn't list that device as unclaimed
2008-01-17T23:05:00.000Z	marion	gerro	I used Synaptic to download and install ndiswrapper.
2008-01-17T23:06:00.000Z	gerro	marion	yeah grab the latest
2008-01-17T23:07:00.000Z	gerro		what is that feature where someone tells you to type something then hold alt and enter numbers to do funky symbols or other stuff? how do I enable that?
2008-01-17T23:09:00.000Z	gerro		aszwetl: try checking with whatever window manager you use?
2008-01-17T23:10:00.000Z	marion	gerro	I am reading the ndiswrapper wiki right now.
2008-01-17T23:14:00.000Z	gerro	marion	kk there something called the ralink 2x00 drivers also abbreviated rt2x00 most popular one rt2500 and I think one of those most likely would work with your pcmia unless they've drastically changed their product line which I doubt
