2007-03-26T10:44:00.000Z	jerkface03		Hey guys I'm having problems running and installing Ubuntu. Ubuntu server never actually starts, it just makes my computer reboot over and over again, while ubuntu desktop's installation just stalls at the ubuntu splash screen.
2007-03-26T10:44:00.000Z	jerkface03		Can anyone help me out?
2007-03-26T10:44:00.000Z	Flannel	jerkface03	try the alternate CD.
2007-03-26T10:44:00.000Z	jerkface03	Flannel	I didn't find one on the download page? Can you please provide me with a link?
2007-03-26T10:45:00.000Z	Flannel	jerkface03	http://releases.ubuntu.com/  The new download pages are impossible to navigate.
2007-03-26T10:46:00.000Z	jerkface03	Flannel	which version of ubuntu do you recommend? I'm just setting it up on 400mhz box w/ a 10gig hd and 256mb ram
2007-03-26T10:47:00.000Z	Flannel	jerkface03	I'm running Dapper on my server-ish machine.  Alternate CD is also able to install a CLI only, which is handy.
2007-03-26T10:48:00.000Z	jerkface03	Flannel	Awesome. I'll try it out. Thank you.
2007-07-10T12:48:00.000Z	Flannel	jerkface03	what sort of stuff you looking to do?  (what you trying to make?)
2007-07-10T12:50:00.000Z	Flannel	jerkface03	Well, there's really nothing specific to linux.  A good deal (all the langauges, and a good deal of toolkits) are cross platform.
2007-07-10T12:50:00.000Z	jerkface03	Flannel	what about things like device drivers?
2007-07-10T12:50:00.000Z	Flannel	jerkface03	No, there really isn't.  gtk, qt, [more and more]  are all OSS, and as such, most have windows ports.
2007-07-10T12:52:00.000Z	Flannel	jerkface03	ah, you're looking for kernel hacking stuff, yeah.  That stuff would be linux specific, but even then, you're sort of abstracted away from most of the linux you know.  But yeah, I suppose that would be linux specific
2007-07-10T12:52:00.000Z	jerkface03	Flannel	ya exactly. So are there any books or guides out there?
2007-07-10T12:53:00.000Z	Flannel	jerkface03	well, you'll need to know C/C++, and yeah, there are plenty of resources on the internet.  I think kernel.org has a hacking howto
2007-07-10T12:54:00.000Z	Flannel	jerkface03	http://www.linuxchix.org/content/courses/kernel_hacking/  is the first google result for 'kernel hacking' and looks to be a pretty good intro, from a cursory glance, that is.
2008-06-09T12:08:00.000Z	Flannel	jerkface03	No you wont, just sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg
2008-06-09T12:09:00.000Z	jerkface03	Flannel	? does that package come with header files and libraries such that i can develop apps using x11?
2008-06-09T12:10:00.000Z	Flannel	jerkface03	No, and actually, if oyu're doing this over SSH, you just want the X client stuff, not the xserver stuff.  Are you really using X itself? or some higher toolkit?
2008-06-09T12:10:00.000Z	jerkface03	Flannel	x itself.
2008-06-09T12:11:00.000Z	Flannel	jerkface03	libx11-dev
