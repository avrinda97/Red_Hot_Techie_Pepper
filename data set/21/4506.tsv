2008-11-08T04:09:00.000Z	newton	phanter	they just reconnect every time etc..
2008-11-08T04:10:00.000Z	phanter		what firewall do you have?
2008-11-08T04:10:00.000Z	newton	phanter	apf and it works great, but it just drops the connection. my firewall isn't the problem but due that high network connections (not only on smtp i just saw) my load is getting big
2008-11-08T04:11:00.000Z	phanter	newton	I do not understand. If your firewall drops the connection... then it is not connecting to your smtp port... right ?
2008-11-08T04:12:00.000Z	newton		phaero: i just restarted my firewall, but the connections must still be closed, but then again its about my load, there connections just dont go away for some reason.
2008-11-08T04:13:00.000Z	phanter	newton	hmm, what smtp server do you use
2008-11-08T04:13:00.000Z	newton	phanter	i've used (if i'm right) postfix
2008-11-08T04:14:00.000Z	newton	phanter	but a silly controle panel removed it ore so and installed another (i dont know which one.)
2008-11-08T04:14:00.000Z	phanter	newton	maybe you want to find that out first :s
2008-11-08T04:14:00.000Z	phanter		how can I install the alternative ubuntu version from usbstick (it keeps asking for cd cd-rom drive)
2008-11-08T04:14:00.000Z	newton	phanter	i checeked /etc/init.d/ and i saw Courier i stopped all that processes from it, and could not connect anymore
2008-11-08T04:15:00.000Z	newton	phanter	so i guess its Courier
2008-11-08T04:16:00.000Z	newton		!language
2008-11-08T04:16:00.000Z	phanter		hmm, i have never seen that server type...
2008-11-08T04:17:00.000Z	newton	phanter	is there any way to exclude everything except the users ip from ps aux ? true egrep ore so?
2008-11-08T04:17:00.000Z	newton	phanter	so i can 'sudo ip r add blackhole IP'
2008-11-08T04:18:00.000Z	newton		i know theres a way to but now the exact command.
2008-11-08T04:19:00.000Z	phanter	newton	well, never done that... I guess you need somebody who is more familier with your services
2008-11-08T04:20:00.000Z	newton	phanter	i'm searching for a regex to exclude a kinda
