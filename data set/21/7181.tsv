2010-11-16T09:15:00.000Z	gogeta	Kevin`	whats he trying to do
2010-11-16T09:17:00.000Z	gogeta	Kevin`	you dont usew windows tools for fixing grub stop spreding bad advice
2010-11-16T09:17:00.000Z	Kevin`	gogeta	grub works fine
2010-11-16T09:20:00.000Z	gogeta	Kevin`	its update-grub2
2010-11-16T09:21:00.000Z	gogeta	Kevin`	you cant use find stage 1 on grub 2
2010-11-16T09:21:00.000Z	Kevin`	gogeta	his grub is working
2010-11-16T09:22:00.000Z	gogeta	Kevin`	grub handels the boot loading
2010-11-16T09:25:00.000Z	gogeta	Kevin`	i dont think thats whats rending it unbootable
2010-11-16T09:25:00.000Z	gogeta	Kevin`	the xp boot loader just looks for first activ and boot it uses the mbr
2010-11-16T09:27:00.000Z	gogeta	Kevin`	if you deleted his partation he changed his layout making grub unable to boot it
2010-11-16T09:27:00.000Z	Kevin`	gogeta	he deleted it before he came here
2010-11-16T09:29:00.000Z	gogeta	Kevin`	i had a windows do that once before and adding chanloder +1 to grub worked
2010-11-16T09:30:00.000Z	Kevin`	gogeta	the command in grub 2 is a bit differenter, but you will note I DID recommend trying that approach first (even though he checked that the actual windows bootloader executable is missing, probably won't do much)
2010-11-16T09:31:00.000Z	gogeta	Kevin`	you mean ntbl or whatever
2010-11-16T09:31:00.000Z	gogeta	Kevin`	that normaly means nucked install
2010-11-16T09:32:00.000Z	Kevin`	gogeta	if you have anything except a straight one disk one partition at install time you risk windows putting the bootloader and main system on different partitions and calling c: q: instead and similar. probably happened to him here.
2010-11-16T09:32:00.000Z	gogeta	Kevin`	never had that happon
2010-11-16T09:43:00.000Z	gogeta	Kevin`	oh a dule roughter setup well he left heh but just connecting to 2 should auto set
