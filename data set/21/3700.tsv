2008-12-19T06:40:00.000Z	\Kira		I used "sudo apt-get install openssh-server" to install a ssh server, and didnt have the time to look at the output and the session became terminated. I looked complete from the glance I took, but there is no ssh port open when I run nmap against the machine
2008-12-19T06:41:00.000Z	lucent	\Kira	you may have to log into the system and run "apt-get -f install"
2008-12-19T06:41:00.000Z	lucent	\Kira	or re-install
2008-12-19T06:41:00.000Z	\Kira	lucent	just apt-get -f install?
2008-12-19T06:41:00.000Z	lucent	\Kira	when packages get into a half-installed state, yeah
2008-12-19T06:42:00.000Z	\Kira	lucent	or "apt-get -f install openssh-server"?
2008-12-19T06:42:00.000Z	\Kira	lucent	ill try it, thanks
2008-12-19T09:54:00.000Z	lucent	\Kira	dmx?
2008-12-19T09:54:00.000Z	lucent	\Kira	or x2x aka synergy
2008-12-19T09:54:00.000Z	\Kira	lucent	Terralthra: Thanks, ill look into them :)
2008-12-19T10:08:00.000Z	lucent	\Kira	it's complicated, there's a series of in-session commands, and I always forget what they're triggered by
2008-12-19T10:08:00.000Z	lucent	\Kira	I think?  it's ~
2008-12-19T10:08:00.000Z	lucent	\Kira	man ssh    i think
2008-12-19T10:09:00.000Z	\Kira	lucent	? I think I worded my question wrong.... I changed my /etc/ssh/ssh_config file, and I want this change to happen in the next connection. As far as I know, restarting the ssh dameon restarts the server.
2008-12-19T10:09:00.000Z	lucent	\Kira	oh, ssh re-reads the config files
2008-12-19T10:09:00.000Z	lucent	\Kira	like we're confused because we find this pretty obvious, sorry I didn't know what to say
2008-12-19T10:10:00.000Z	\Kira	lucent	raylu: sorry, im rather new to servers.... Thanks, though
2008-12-19T10:11:00.000Z	lucent	\Kira	no I just get jaded over time and forget that long time ago when I learned this all
2008-12-19T10:11:00.000Z	\Kira	lucent	I see.
2008-12-19T11:40:00.000Z	lucent	\Kira	oh, happens all the time :P    what  does "file elite.htm" have to say about its content?
2008-12-19T11:41:00.000Z	\Kira	lucent	its like this matrix thing, my first assumption was that some stupid immature kid hacked me and wanted to brag, but that didnt seem right
