2007-06-02T15:02:00.000Z	Gothfunc		just installing feisty
2007-06-02T15:02:00.000Z	Gothfunc		and my timezone is london, which ubuntu says is GMT+1
2007-06-02T15:02:00.000Z	Gothfunc		:s
2007-06-02T15:02:00.000Z	Gothfunc		what's that about?
2007-06-02T15:03:00.000Z	Gothfunc		london is clearly GMT+0
2007-06-02T15:03:00.000Z	Gothfunc		apparently reykjavik is GMT
2007-06-02T15:04:00.000Z	Gothfunc		not london
2007-06-02T15:04:00.000Z	Gothfunc		iceland
2007-06-02T15:04:00.000Z	wols	Gothfunc	GMT has no summer time
2007-06-02T15:04:00.000Z	Gothfunc	wols	what do you mean?
2007-06-02T15:04:00.000Z	wols	Gothfunc	that currently the London timezone is really GMT+1.
2007-06-02T15:05:00.000Z	Gothfunc	wols	well we DO have daylight saving
2007-06-02T15:05:00.000Z	Gothfunc	wols	so it's incorrect
2007-06-02T15:05:00.000Z	wols	Gothfunc	yes. and GMT has no dalylight saving. but UK does
2007-06-02T15:05:00.000Z	wols	Gothfunc	and no it's not incorrect
2007-06-02T15:06:00.000Z	Gothfunc	wols	this really is the first i've heard of this.  i'm not sure it's right at all.  looking it up now
2007-06-02T15:10:00.000Z	Gothfunc	wols	london is always GMT :|
2007-06-02T15:10:00.000Z	wols	Gothfunc	no
2007-06-02T15:10:00.000Z	wols	Gothfunc	but suit yourself
2007-06-02T15:11:00.000Z	Gothfunc	wols	ok, i'd be willing to accept a contradiction, but do you have any evidence?
