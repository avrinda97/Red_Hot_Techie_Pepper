2005-08-11T16:53:00.000Z	cafuego		There's a shareware tool for OSX called 'NFS Manager' to help you set up automount NFS shares in OSX. it works great.
2005-08-11T16:55:00.000Z	cafuego		MikeW:You normally don't need one at all.
2005-08-11T16:57:00.000Z	MikeW	cafuego	My mobo doesn't support large drives. I can't boot into ubuntu - grub keeps throwing 'Error 18'. So I've set the bios to see my hdd as LBA 512mb. And I think I'll create a really small partition at the start for boot stuff
2005-08-11T16:58:00.000Z	MikeW	cafuego	Blissex: should the first partition be mounted as / or /boot for grub?
2005-08-11T16:58:00.000Z	cafuego	MikeW	If it's at the start of the disk, you don't need /boot at all. Just go with /
2005-08-11T16:59:00.000Z	MikeW	cafuego	okay, then for my ubuntu install partition, that should be /boot?
2005-08-11T16:59:00.000Z	cafuego	MikeW	/boot is a workaround for shitty boot loaders a couple of years ago.
2005-08-11T16:59:00.000Z	cafuego	MikeW	Just tell ubuntu to set 'em up automagically.
2005-08-11T16:59:00.000Z	MikeW	cafuego	I tried that 5 times, I can never boot into it
2005-08-11T05:00:00.000Z	MikeW	cafuego	it took up the whole hdd with its 2 partitions, it still wouldn't boot
2005-08-11T05:00:00.000Z	cafuego	MikeW	Are you sharing that disk with another os?
2005-08-11T05:00:00.000Z	MikeW	cafuego	completely blank brand new hdd
2005-08-11T05:00:00.000Z	MikeW	cafuego	no other os
2005-08-11T05:00:00.000Z	cafuego	MikeW	Then go with /boot (first) - in between 20 and 50Mb
2005-08-11T05:01:00.000Z	MikeW	cafuego	do I set the bootable flag?
2005-08-11T05:01:00.000Z	cafuego	MikeW	Yep
2005-08-11T05:01:00.000Z	cafuego	MikeW	Not that it matters much, the boot lader will come from the MBR anyway.
2005-08-11T05:02:00.000Z	cafuego	MikeW	If you previously had boot probems after installing GRUB, try LILO as well..
2005-08-11T05:02:00.000Z	MikeW	cafuego	I don't know how to set that in the ubuntu installer. I didn't see anywhere to set it
2005-08-11T05:02:00.000Z	cafuego	MikeW	it should be an option for the bottom in the advances config
2005-08-11T05:05:00.000Z	cafuego	MikeW	Hmm, maybe I'm mistaken. The debian one certainly has it, I didn't think the Ubuntu one was that different.
