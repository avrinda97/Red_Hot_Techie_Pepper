2007-07-26T14:25:00.000Z	Kawika	marui	so you are trying to totally get rid of Linux, and install XP?
2007-07-26T14:31:00.000Z	Kawika	marui	so now you are saying that nothing happens when you try the live cd?
2007-07-26T14:31:00.000Z	Kawika	marui	when you boot, do you get an option to "Boot to CD" ?
2007-07-26T14:34:00.000Z	Kawika	marui	you've had problems installing Windows as well?  I'm starting to think it's hardware issues then.
2007-07-26T14:35:00.000Z	Kawika	marui	I think your boot order is not set right.
2007-07-26T14:35:00.000Z	Kawika	marui	you need to go into the bios and make sure CD is set to boot first
2007-07-26T14:36:00.000Z	Kawika	marui	do you have access to another CD drive?
2007-07-26T14:36:00.000Z	Kawika	marui	in the bios, change the CD line, so it boots to the other CD drive than you are using now.
2007-07-26T14:37:00.000Z	Kawika	marui	there should be somewhere else near that same screen, that shows boot order of just the CD's.
2007-07-26T14:40:00.000Z	Kawika	marui	I'm not so sure about that.  HDC would hint towards the motherboard.
2007-07-26T14:41:00.000Z	Kawika	marui	do you  have a regular telephone line?
