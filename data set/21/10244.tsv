2005-09-16T13:34:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		beagle isn't working.
2005-09-16T13:34:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		The query for fox failed.
2005-09-16T13:34:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		The likely cause is that the beagle daemon isn't running.Click to start the Beagle daemon...
2005-09-16T13:34:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		does nothing.
2005-09-16T13:34:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		why the hell does beagle need a daemon.
2005-09-16T13:34:00.000Z	kevogod	bluefoxicy	So it can index files?
2005-09-16T13:35:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	kevogod	 so do it from the application?
2005-09-16T13:35:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	kevogod	it seems that rhythmbox can index mp3s fine
2005-09-16T13:36:00.000Z	kevogod	bluefoxicy	The daemon ensures that your search always up-to-date.
2005-09-16T13:37:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	kevogod	 beagled doesn't work.

2005-09-16T13:38:00.000Z	kevogod	bluefoxicy	Sure it does. I would not judge Beagle on Ubuntu.
2005-09-16T13:43:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	kevogod	 I would probably design it to find files by path and check their mtime, then hash, to see if they changed.  The question is, though, how does beagle index files anyway?
2005-09-16T13:43:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	kevogod	 it can't possibly kep a database "File X contains dog, foo, cat, beagle, nmap"

2005-09-16T13:44:00.000Z	kevogod	bluefoxicy	It has never been conserving space.

2005-09-16T13:48:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	kevogod	 They don't appear to have open design documentation; apparently they like to just implement and leave the design in the code.
2005-09-16T13:48:00.000Z	kevogod	bluefoxicy	Don't use then, stop complaining, or go code your self.
2005-09-16T13:49:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	kevogod	 but i'm curious to see how this works~
2005-09-16T13:50:00.000Z	kevogod	bluefoxicy	Is it that hard to understand how something is added to a database with searchable metadata? It is not inherently large. It makes it almost instant to make searches due to the centralization of metadata.
