2007-11-15T05:09:00.000Z	athem		anyone else using totem with xine frontend?
2007-11-15T05:09:00.000Z	Pelo	athem	 not right now but I did in the past, what is your issue ?
2007-11-15T05:11:00.000Z	athem	Pelo	I just installed it instead of the default gstreamer based totem and it cant play anything atm, it just tells me I "need to install support for format xy"
2007-11-15T05:11:00.000Z	Pelo	athem	 also install xine,  might resolve some codex issues
2007-11-15T05:12:00.000Z	athem	Pelo	I searched the internet about the problem and I think I am missing the xine-lib?
2007-11-15T05:12:00.000Z	Pelo	athem	 should have been added when you installed totem-xine but look in synaptic anyway <
2007-11-15T05:13:00.000Z	athem	Pelo	what is the name of the package in synaptic?
2007-11-15T05:14:00.000Z	Pelo	athem	 just do a search for xine it will be listed
2007-11-15T05:14:00.000Z	athem	Pelo	I did already but there are several packages with xine in their name
2007-11-15T05:15:00.000Z	Pelo	athem	 you are looking for one with both xine and lib
2007-11-15T05:16:00.000Z	athem	Pelo	libxine1 the right one? though this one is installed already according to synaptic
2007-11-15T05:17:00.000Z	Pelo	athem	 sounds about right,  try reinstalling , but give me a minute and I'll check on my side
2007-11-15T05:17:00.000Z	athem	Pelo	that'd be cool, thanks a alot
2007-11-15T05:21:00.000Z	Pelo	athem	 I suggest you install all the libxine pakcage that's all I can suggest, I don't realy recall why I stopped using totem-xine, might have been a quesiton of codex but I don'T think so
2007-11-15T05:23:00.000Z	athem	Pelo	problem I have is that gstreamer gives me some choppy playback on some formats while they do work flawlessly under KDE using Kaffeine and the xine backend. but i prefer gnome ;)
2007-11-15T05:24:00.000Z	Pelo	athem	install all the gstreamer packages in the repos then,  but I can't make any promisses,  some formats just play better on other player,  I have totem, xine, mplayer installed, just in case I need them,  I didn't install vlc this time around , I didn't use it often enought
2007-11-15T05:25:00.000Z	athem	Pelo	this is the error message totem gives me when trying to open any file so far: "Video codec 'xxyy' is not handled. You might need to install additionale plugins to be able to play some types of movies
2007-11-15T05:26:00.000Z	Pelo	athem	try looking up the error msg in the forum, www.ubuntuforums.org
2007-11-15T05:26:00.000Z	athem	Pelo	ok, will do. thx
2007-11-15T05:39:00.000Z	athem	Pelo	I got it working, the missing packages where libxine1-gnome and libxine1-ffmpeg. somehow those aren't installed on default..
2007-11-15T05:40:00.000Z	athem	Pelo	still getting some artifacts showing up on WMV files, but that should be fixable too ;)
