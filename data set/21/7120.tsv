2006-11-30T10:51:00.000Z	gpafixit		Does root own all things mounted on boot? (and fat32?)
2006-11-30T10:52:00.000Z	SilentDis	gpafixit	 root owns all, it is all, it exists as all.  if root can't get to it, it can't be gotten to ;)
2006-11-30T10:52:00.000Z	gpafixit	SilentDis	lol .. well I kinda expected that .. but does root have to own fat32 mounted stuff? is gid=46 automaticly root?
2006-11-30T10:53:00.000Z	SilentDis	gpafixit	 got a file you can't modify on some fat32 drive?
2006-11-30T10:54:00.000Z	gpafixit	SilentDis	Yeah, kinda .. I move the files to ext3 directory .. doctor them up so they work like magic, move them back (as user not root) and plop, they are friggin, executibles again ..
2006-11-30T10:54:00.000Z	SilentDis	gpafixit	 ahhhh.  hmm... that's weird.  on fat32, it SHOULD pull from extensions and work...  did you go into properties on the file (on fat32) and choose what app to always open it with?
2006-11-30T10:56:00.000Z	gpafixit	SilentDis	Yes, right click, open with (or add) .. and whomp, executible file .. move it back to ext3 .. do the same thing and perfection .. but it's GOT to be on the fat side so my slacker relatives can get to them when they boot into winblows .. you know? .. its been a thorn and I'm going back home (8000 miles away) in a couple days ..
2006-11-30T10:57:00.000Z	SilentDis	gpafixit	 i totally understand.  got a netdisk thingy from ximeta that's in fat32 so the roommates can get to it from their windows box.
2006-11-30T10:57:00.000Z	gpafixit	SilentDis	is my fstab borking it?
2006-11-30T10:57:00.000Z	SilentDis	gpafixit	 no idea at this point.  how are you mounting it in fstab?
2006-11-30T10:59:00.000Z	SilentDis	gpafixit	 the options I'm running for my 2 fat32 drives is defaults,utf8,umask=007,gid=46 - works fine (pulls from extensions)
2006-11-30T10:59:00.000Z	gpafixit	SilentDis	/dev/hdb1    /media/Storage vfat  defaults,utf8,umask=006,gid=46  0    0
2006-11-30T10:59:00.000Z	gpafixit	SilentDis	I had it umask=007 .. with the same results ..
2006-11-30T10:59:00.000Z	SilentDis	gpafixit	 hmm... not fstab then.
2006-11-30T11:00:00.000Z	SilentDis	gpafixit	 really sounds like something's borked in nautilus config
2006-11-30T11:00:00.000Z	gpafixit	SilentDis	Lemme gconf-editor nautilus N see ..
2006-11-30T11:00:00.000Z	SilentDis	gpafixit	 opening mine as well
2006-11-30T11:01:00.000Z	gpafixit	SilentDis	nothing seems strange in mine ..
2006-11-30T11:03:00.000Z	SilentDis	gpafixit	 i'm, unfortunatly, out of ideas :(
2006-11-30T11:04:00.000Z	gpafixit	SilentDis	no problem .. I'll figure something out .. lol
2006-11-30T11:05:00.000Z	SilentDis	gpafixit	 if it doesn't fit, jam it.  if it breaks, it needed fixing anyway :D
