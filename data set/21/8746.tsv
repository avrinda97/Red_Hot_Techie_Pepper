2008-06-08T16:35:00.000Z	cgentry72		what is required to play mp3 files?
2008-06-08T16:36:00.000Z	Gin	cgentry72	when you open a mp3 file, it should guide you to install the codecs needed.
2008-06-08T16:36:00.000Z	cgentry72	Gin	it already did but the mp3s have stopped playing now for some reason
2008-06-08T16:37:00.000Z	cgentry72	Gin	i was going to uninstall it and reinstall the codecs
2008-06-08T16:37:00.000Z	Gin	cgentry72	bad mp3 file?
2008-06-08T16:37:00.000Z	Gin	cgentry72	also try to play it with vlc
2008-06-08T16:37:00.000Z	cgentry72	Gin	20 some of bad mp3 files, no
2008-06-08T16:37:00.000Z	cgentry72	Gin	i do but my system sounds dont work
2008-06-08T16:38:00.000Z	Gin	cgentry72	no sound in vlc?
2008-06-08T16:38:00.000Z	Gin	cgentry72	install vlc-plugin-alsa vlc-plugin-pulse
2008-06-08T16:38:00.000Z	cgentry72	Gin	will this allow my system sounds to work though
2008-06-08T16:39:00.000Z	Gin	cgentry72	I think so. depends on your system settings
2008-06-08T16:39:00.000Z	cgentry72	Gin	ok i'll give it a shot cause the preview mp3, wav doesnt work
2008-06-08T16:40:00.000Z	cgentry72	Gin	no go, still doesn't let me play the system sounds
2008-06-08T16:41:00.000Z	Gin	cgentry72	do you have firefox with flash open?
2008-06-08T16:41:00.000Z	cgentry72	Gin	nope
2008-06-08T16:41:00.000Z	Gin	cgentry72	weird
2008-06-08T16:42:00.000Z	cgentry72	Gin	so i was thinking uninstall the codecs and reinstall them but the system automatically plays wav files upon startup without the codecs
2008-06-08T16:42:00.000Z	Gin	cgentry72	go to System->pref-> sound
2008-06-08T16:42:00.000Z	Gin	cgentry72	what do you have selected as output for sound playback?
2008-06-08T16:44:00.000Z	cgentry72	Gin	autodetect
