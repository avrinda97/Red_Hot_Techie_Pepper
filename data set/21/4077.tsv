2009-01-31T20:31:00.000Z	qdb		hello . you cannot say me?
2009-01-31T20:32:00.000Z	soundray	qdb	we can see you all right. Ask your question again, it's not clear what you meant
2009-01-31T20:33:00.000Z	soundray	qdb	yes, version upgrades usually require rebooting.
2009-01-31T20:35:00.000Z	soundray	qdb	what do you mean by "this concrete update"
2009-01-31T20:35:00.000Z	soundray	qdb	can you please describe your problem, the whole story, from the beginning
2009-01-31T20:37:00.000Z	soundray	qdb	the problem, please
2009-01-31T20:38:00.000Z	soundray	qdb	what's your first language?
2009-01-31T20:44:00.000Z	qdb	soundray	 do you use 8.10 and have installed all updates?
2009-01-31T20:44:00.000Z	soundray	qdb	yes
2009-01-31T20:55:00.000Z	soundray	qdb	there is no such thing as "the previous to last update". Packages are being updated all the time.
2009-01-31T20:56:00.000Z	soundray	qdb	some package updates require reboots (notably kernel updates). Others don't.
2009-01-31T20:57:00.000Z	soundray	qdb	you can get a list of the files in your current kernel package with 'dpkg -L linux-image-$(uname -r)
2009-01-31T21:06:00.000Z	qdb	soundray	does your system also use /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.27-11-generic ?
2009-01-31T21:06:00.000Z	soundray	qdb	yes
2009-01-31T21:07:00.000Z	soundray	qdb	no, it isn't -- but then I'm on 64bit
2009-01-31T21:08:00.000Z	soundray	qdb	what are you worried about?
2009-01-31T21:10:00.000Z	soundray	qdb	what makes you think that?
2009-01-31T21:12:00.000Z	soundray	qdb	if you're really seriously concerned, the best thing you can do is to get an install CD from a location you trust (Shipit perhaps) and do a fresh installation.
2009-01-31T21:12:00.000Z	soundray	qdb	I don't believe you've been hacked in this way, though -- it's too unlikely.
