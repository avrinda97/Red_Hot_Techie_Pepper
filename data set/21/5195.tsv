2008-07-03T19:26:00.000Z	suren	Jack_Sparrow	can you still help?

2008-07-03T19:27:00.000Z	suren	Jack_Sparrow	im not sure, how can i check?
2008-07-03T19:28:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	suren	Found it, reading up on that now
2008-07-03T19:29:00.000Z	suren	Jack_Sparrow	ok thanks very much. please let me know
2008-07-03T19:35:00.000Z	suren	Jack_Sparrow	any luck? any way I can find out what network card is inside?
2008-07-03T19:35:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	suren	I was reading through the laptop testing pages...
2008-07-03T19:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	suren	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTestingTeam/AsusF3Ka       we the closest model I found and it had no ethernet issues..  use the link to asus to see if it has the same ethernet as yours.
2008-07-03T19:37:00.000Z	suren	Jack_Sparrow	on the asus site, it doesnt say the network card model name
2008-07-03T19:38:00.000Z	suren	Jack_Sparrow	i just found out by running lspci... the network card name is Ethernet controller: Attansic Technology Corp. L1 Gigabit Ethernet Adapter, and i have a Netgear WPN824v2 router
2008-07-03T19:40:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	suren	it looks as though you need to use  ndiswrapper for that
2008-07-03T19:40:00.000Z	suren	Jack_Sparrow	how do i determine if that is indeed the problem?
2008-07-03T19:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	suren	Still looking into the problem
2008-07-03T19:44:00.000Z	suren	Jack_Sparrow	ok no worries. thank you
2008-07-03T19:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	suren	http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-768100.html                   has some info, but that should be working
2008-07-03T19:48:00.000Z	suren	Jack_Sparrow	ok thanks, im reading it now. i'll let you know how it goes
2008-07-03T19:48:00.000Z	suren	Jack_Sparrow	sorry, but that isnt too helpful, as im looking for troubleshooting for my *wired* connection. wireless is fine!
