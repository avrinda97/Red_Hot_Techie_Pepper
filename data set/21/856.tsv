2011-05-07T08:18:00.000Z	bzzzz		is dpkg defunct?
2011-05-07T08:18:00.000Z	bzzzz		oh wait, that's for #debian
2011-05-07T08:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bzzzz	no it is used by apt-get and software-centre to install packages
2011-05-07T08:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bzzzz	debian still uses dpkg too
2011-05-07T08:19:00.000Z	bzzzz	ActionParsnip	i meant the irc entity
2011-05-07T08:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bzzzz	how do you mean
2011-05-07T08:19:00.000Z	bzzzz	ActionParsnip	join #debian, hit !help, see dpkg respond

2011-05-07T08:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bzzzz	I still don't see what you are getting at
2011-05-07T08:21:00.000Z	bzzzz		anyway, i'm triyng to create a usb-based installer out of the iso i downloaded, but the instructions @ !help usb aren't too clear about what to do with the rest of the 500-odd MB of stuff that doesn't exist in caseper/
2011-05-07T08:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		!remaster | bzzzz
2011-05-07T08:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bzzzz	you can transfer the iso to the usb using unetbootin
2011-05-07T08:22:00.000Z	bzzzz		uh, it's not a live cd iso...
2011-05-07T08:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bzzzz	in windows you can use unetbootin too
2011-05-07T08:22:00.000Z	bzzzz	ActionParsnip	yeah, i was hoping for a more straightforward cli way of doing it, besides 'oh, install usb-creator or X and click the gui'
2011-05-07T08:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bzzzz	uh, it doesn't matter if its a live desktop ISO
2011-05-07T08:23:00.000Z	bzzzz	ActionParsnip	i'm actually on a debian laptop right now, but i wanna get ubuntu on my desktop
2011-05-07T08:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bzzzz	unetbootin is available in the debain reop too
2011-05-07T08:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		*repo
2011-05-07T08:25:00.000Z	bzzzz	ActionParsnip	unetbootin really doesn't help me at this point. i just spent 2 hours downloading the install iso, just to follow the instructions on the ubuntu wiki, which turns out to be a dead end.
