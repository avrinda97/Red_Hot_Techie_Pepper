2006-05-28T05:06:00.000Z	ChrisCF		Yes
2006-05-28T05:07:00.000Z	duck--	ChrisCF	well, that's odd
2006-05-28T05:11:00.000Z	duck--	ChrisCF	that sounds like something strange is going on.  you could add the admin group and add your user to it
2006-05-28T05:11:00.000Z	ChrisCF	duck--	... or I could just keep the setup I have now, which works.
2006-05-28T05:11:00.000Z	duck--	ChrisCF	then add the admin entry to the sudoers file
2006-05-28T05:12:00.000Z	duck--	ChrisCF	you can, but it's bad form.  But do as you want
2006-05-28T05:13:00.000Z	duck--	ChrisCF	but again, it works but not in good form.  That's why they changed it in dapper
2006-05-28T05:14:00.000Z	ChrisCF	duck--	No real reason why I should change it thought.
2006-05-28T05:14:00.000Z	duck--	ChrisCF	I'm not 100% positive of that, but I know it's considered bad form :)
2006-05-28T05:14:00.000Z	duck--	ChrisCF	maybe, it's your call
2006-05-28T05:35:00.000Z	ChrisCF	duck--	It would probably work for the same reason that you can put a short (100MB) iso onto a CD
2006-05-28T05:35:00.000Z	duck--	ChrisCF	that was my thought exactly, but I'd never tried it and wasn't sure if it was encoded the same or whatever
2006-05-28T05:35:00.000Z	ChrisCF	duck--	iso images is iso images is iso images :)
2006-05-28T05:36:00.000Z	duck--	ChrisCF	nein! i'm in iso denial!
2006-05-28T05:38:00.000Z	ChrisCF	duck--	"only"
2006-05-28T05:38:00.000Z	duck--	ChrisCF	well....
2006-05-28T05:39:00.000Z	duck--	ChrisCF	wow, I don't have nearly that much data
2006-05-28T05:42:00.000Z	ChrisCF	duck--	I came up with a simple solution to the dual-boot problem.
2006-05-28T05:42:00.000Z	duck--	ChrisCF	don't do it? :)
2006-05-28T05:42:00.000Z	duck--	ChrisCF	I develop on my laptop at school
2006-05-28T05:43:00.000Z	duck--	ChrisCF	And I can't stand windows, I tolerate it for windows development
