2012-11-02T12:37:00.000Z	linux_noob		none here?
2012-11-02T12:38:00.000Z	Rootbrian	linux_noob	many are here
2012-11-02T12:39:00.000Z	Rootbrian	linux_noob	there should be an option to disable the detection of secure boot by pressing F6 when at the boot launcher.
2012-11-02T12:40:00.000Z	Rootbrian	linux_noob	if that works, what I mentioned previously.
2012-11-02T12:41:00.000Z	Rootbrian	linux_noob	boot from the CD or liveusb, whichever you made, but ensure the boot order in the BIOS is set to hard disk being last.
2012-11-02T12:41:00.000Z	linux_noob	Rootbrian	Already done. Still does not seem to work for me.
2012-11-02T12:42:00.000Z	Rootbrian	linux_noob	are you booting from CD or liveUSB?
2012-11-02T12:42:00.000Z	linux_noob	Rootbrian	liveUSB
2012-11-02T12:43:00.000Z	Rootbrian	linux_noob	what is the boot order? Also, ensure the bios can even boot from a usb device.
2012-11-02T12:44:00.000Z	linux_noob	Rootbrian	I've had it work in the past, one second though, it's possible I've made a error when putting Ubuntu on to the USB.
2012-11-02T12:45:00.000Z	Rootbrian	linux_noob	use unetbootin. That usually works best. Format the usb drive first.
2012-11-02T12:46:00.000Z	linux_noob	Rootbrian	Thanks, have tried unetbootin a few times. I think it's an issue with administrator priviledges on the computer I'm using to make the USB. Always have problems when creating a USB on Windows.
2012-11-02T12:46:00.000Z	linux_noob	Rootbrian	Will let you know if it works this time around.
2012-11-02T12:47:00.000Z	Rootbrian	linux_noob	login as administrator if you're having issues, or run as administrator.
2012-11-02T13:19:00.000Z	linux_noob	Rootbrian	Back after trying again. Same error immediately after boot. "Secure boot not enabled"
2012-11-02T13:21:00.000Z	Rootbrian	linux_noob	I'm not sure what else that can be done. Can I suggest burning a live CD on a CD-R/RW disc and booting from it and trying again?
2012-11-02T13:22:00.000Z	linux_noob	Rootbrian	Unfortunately, no optical drive on this laptop. Only option is USB.
2012-11-02T13:22:00.000Z	Rootbrian	linux_noob	connect a usb cd drive maybe?
2012-11-02T13:22:00.000Z	linux_noob	Rootbrian	Thanks anyways for the help, I'll look in to it further. From what I have found so far it's a new feature included in Ubuntu 12.10
2012-11-02T13:22:00.000Z	linux_noob	Rootbrian	Don't own one.
2012-11-02T13:23:00.000Z	Rootbrian	linux_noob	I suggest now using 12.04.1 LTS.
