2008-11-14T01:45:00.000Z	Mahalo		Hey folks, on my way to completely linux...with one last issue. My Ubuntu Intrepid desktop. I added a HDD that formerly has M$ XP on it and I'm trying to get Ubuntu to see it and automount it so can use it for storage.
2008-11-14T01:46:00.000Z	Mahalo		Any pointers to a site with steps?
2008-11-14T01:47:00.000Z	Spion	Mahalo	in my experience it should usually appear automatically. If it doesn't its possible that it has a NTFS partition which was not cleanly unmounted.
2008-11-14T01:47:00.000Z	Mahalo	Spion	that is what happened...
2008-11-14T01:47:00.000Z	Spion	Mahalo	when that happens I usually mount it from the command line using --force
2008-11-14T01:48:00.000Z	Spion		(I'm not sure if its completely safe, but so far it worked fine)
2008-11-14T01:48:00.000Z	Mahalo		hmm... sudo mount sda1 --force
2008-11-14T01:49:00.000Z	Spion	Mahalo	I think it would be something like mount --force /dev/sdaX /media/EmptyDirectory
2008-11-14T01:49:00.000Z	Spion		sudo mount ... :) sorry
2008-11-14T01:51:00.000Z	Mahalo	Spion	I have no idea what is still on there...
2008-11-14T01:52:00.000Z	Mahalo		I formatted using ext3
2008-11-14T01:53:00.000Z	Mahalo		I see /dev/sda1 =  ext3
2008-11-14T01:53:00.000Z	Spion	Mahalo	you formatted the new disk? so its not NTFS anymore? hm
2008-11-14T01:53:00.000Z	Mahalo		Old disk, was NTFS with boot part on it, for sure.
2008-11-14T01:54:00.000Z	Spion		erm, /dev/sda1 would probably be the old disk.
2008-11-14T01:54:00.000Z	Mahalo		can I parted it to make it 100% clean?
2008-11-14T01:55:00.000Z	Spion	Mahalo	well, you can use gparted to see in what state it is right now
2008-11-14T01:55:00.000Z	Mahalo		kk, it is working on it now. (gparted is)
2008-11-14T01:56:00.000Z	Spion		Be careful though... :)
2008-11-14T01:57:00.000Z	Spion	Mahalo	btw, how many disks did gparted find?
2008-11-14T01:57:00.000Z	Mahalo	Spion	/dev/sda1 114.48 GiB + 7.84 MiB unallocated
