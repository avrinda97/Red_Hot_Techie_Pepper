2007-11-01T04:29:00.000Z	Casey		How do I mass rename but keep a part of the filename? Ex: asdf?=video1.wmv, asdf?=video2.wmv asdf?=video3.wmv I want to remove asdf?= and keep everything after that saved.
2007-11-01T04:30:00.000Z	jrib	Casey	the 'rename' command
2007-11-01T04:30:00.000Z	Casey	jrib	I know that but what parameters?
2007-11-01T04:31:00.000Z	jrib	Casey	do you know regex?
2007-11-01T04:31:00.000Z	Casey	jrib	no
2007-11-01T04:33:00.000Z	jrib	Casey	well you could probably do something like (untested, but will just say what it will do unless you remove the -n):  rename -n 's/^asdf\?\=//' *
2007-11-01T04:33:00.000Z	Casey	jrib	thanks
2009-08-05T01:40:00.000Z	jrib	Casey	yes if you remember them.
2009-08-05T01:40:00.000Z	jrib	Casey	or from backups or from some other reference of coures
2009-08-05T01:43:00.000Z	jrib	Casey	recursively?
2009-08-05T01:44:00.000Z	jrib	Casey	run "yes", you will see it just echoes "y" over and over
2009-08-05T01:44:00.000Z	jrib	Casey	why did do that chmod...?
2009-08-05T01:45:00.000Z	jrib	Casey	what?
2009-08-05T01:48:00.000Z	jrib	Casey	is this a new install?
2009-08-05T01:49:00.000Z	jrib	Casey	well the easiest way to fix this is backup and reinstall.  Otherwise use a live cd as a reference and restore the permissions
2009-08-05T01:49:00.000Z	jrib	Casey	did you read what I said?
2009-08-05T01:51:00.000Z	jrib	Casey	well I said to use a live cd as a reference if you choose to do it that way.  But really backups and a reinstall would be faster if you aren't comfortable doing this.
2009-08-05T01:51:00.000Z	jrib	Casey	also please address people you reply to
2009-08-05T01:51:00.000Z	jrib	Casey	what is a "recovering"...?
2009-08-05T01:51:00.000Z	jrib	Casey	just put their nick at the beginning of what you say
2009-08-05T01:53:00.000Z	jrib	Casey	not for repairing this, no.
