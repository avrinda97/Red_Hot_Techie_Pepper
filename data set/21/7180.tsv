2007-03-06T15:33:00.000Z	techie_		hello Can anybody explain in Ubutnu what does the terminal service client does?
2007-03-06T15:33:00.000Z	Slart	techie_	connects to terminal server servers?
2007-03-06T15:34:00.000Z	Slart	techie_	it's a solution where many people log into the same computer.. do a little google on it.. it's a well known thing. .many corporations use it
2007-03-06T15:34:00.000Z	Slart	techie_	it's not something you want to try if you don't know what it is..
2007-03-06T15:35:00.000Z	Slart	techie_	well... close.. but that is if you have the _server_ software.. the terminal server _client_ can only connect to a server and use it.. the server costs money.. big piles of money
2007-03-06T15:36:00.000Z	Slart	techie_	you'll have to buy it from Microsoft
2007-03-06T15:38:00.000Z	Slart	techie_	sounds like a nice thing.. I don't know of anything similiar for linux/ubuntu.. but there might exist something out there
2007-03-06T15:39:00.000Z	Slart	techie_	do you know of any similar programs for windows?.. that's free?
2007-03-06T15:42:00.000Z	Slart	techie_	I'll do a little googling.. brb
2007-03-06T15:42:00.000Z	Slart	techie_	ah.. I thought I recognized it.... it's a FTP server.. there are plenty of those for linux
2007-03-06T15:43:00.000Z	Slart	techie_	I have even used it.. put a little "U" in the task bar
2007-03-06T15:45:00.000Z	Slart	techie_	an ftp server will enable you to share files with friends.. and they can upload files to you..  that's about it..
2007-03-06T15:46:00.000Z	Slart	techie_	the serv-U software had a little icon in the taskbar on windows.. a little U... green when online.. red when offline
2007-03-06T15:46:00.000Z	Slart	techie_	lets see what ubotu says..
2007-03-06T15:48:00.000Z	Slart	techie_	you do so.. good luck... oh.. and have a look at the others too
2007-03-06T16:28:00.000Z	Slart	techie_	you installed a windows program and it messed up your terminal?
2007-03-06T16:29:00.000Z	Slart	techie_	you are running it through wine?
2007-03-06T16:30:00.000Z	Slart	techie_	yea.. that's stuff they haven't finished in wine yet.. if the program works it works.. if it doesn't you'll have to wait until they fix it
2007-03-06T16:30:00.000Z	Slart	techie_	there are few windows programs that run without any errors at all
2007-03-06T16:31:00.000Z	Slart	techie_	if it works.. keep it.. it not.. well.. you might as well install it.. or wait for a new version of wine that perhaps fixes it
2007-03-06T16:32:00.000Z	Slart	techie_	but does it work? or it just crashes?... you might want to check appdb.wine.org to see if it's a known application with workarounds etc
