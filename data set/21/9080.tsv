2005-11-17T11:12:00.000Z	SSJiffy		Hello
2005-11-17T11:12:00.000Z	SSJiffy		My GRUB install is freaking out on me.
2005-11-17T11:12:00.000Z	SSJiffy		It's all blurred and won't boot windows.
2005-11-17T11:12:00.000Z	SSJiffy		it says error.
2005-11-17T11:12:00.000Z	SSJiffy		Anyone know how to fix grub?
2005-11-17T11:13:00.000Z	dabaR	SSJiffy	fix it how? be specific wehat you want and what you dont have
2005-11-17T11:15:00.000Z	SSJiffy	dabaR	GRUB has Windows XP listed, but when we select it, it doesnt boot it just says 'error 12'
2005-11-17T11:15:00.000Z	dabaR	SSJiffy	does he have one hard drive?
2005-11-17T11:15:00.000Z	SSJiffy	dabaR	it's only one hard drive
2005-11-17T11:15:00.000Z	dabaR	SSJiffy	is he online? are you at that computer?
2005-11-17T11:15:00.000Z	SSJiffy	dabaR	windows partition and ubuntu
2005-11-17T11:16:00.000Z	SSJiffy	dabaR	im using the very computer, he isnt here anymore
2005-11-17T11:18:00.000Z	dabaR	SSJiffy	well, post the outputs of "cat /boot/grub/menu.lst" and "sudo fdisk -l" from a terminal to the paste.ubuntulinux.nl web site.
2005-11-17T11:25:00.000Z	dabaR	SSJiffy	as soon as you are ready...
2005-11-17T11:25:00.000Z	SSJiffy	dabaR	Nothing came up
2005-11-17T11:26:00.000Z	SSJiffy	dabaR	first command isnt recognized and the second listed my sda's
2005-11-17T11:27:00.000Z	dabaR	SSJiffy	so paste them to paste.ubuntulinux.nl
2005-11-17T11:28:00.000Z	dabaR	SSJiffy	also, cat /boot/grub/menu.lst has to show something, in fact, the file.
2005-11-17T11:35:00.000Z	dabaR	SSJiffy	open a terminal, and type sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
2005-11-17T11:36:00.000Z	dabaR	SSJiffy	that question decomposes to how do I display, and where is my grub configuration....
