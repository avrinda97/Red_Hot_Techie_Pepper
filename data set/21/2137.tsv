2012-02-22T06:34:00.000Z	acidrain		ok i have a ubuntu hdd that i have put into a newly bought comp.  i booted from the ubuntu disk, and now it wont connect to the internet.
2012-02-22T06:35:00.000Z	acidrain		does anyone know what could be causing this problem?
2012-02-22T06:35:00.000Z	acidrain		its a desktop, and its on a wire. connected straight to router
2012-02-22T06:36:00.000Z	acidrain		ive had this issue before. but i forgot how i fixed it
2012-02-22T06:37:00.000Z	rattatoue	acidrain	you could try sudo ifconfig eth0 down and then sudo ifconfig eth0 up in terminal. Sometimes that will reload the connection and pull an IP
2012-02-22T06:37:00.000Z	acidrain		ive made it as far as ifconfig eth0 saying that i am connected.
2012-02-22T06:37:00.000Z	acidrain	rattatoue	let me try this
2012-02-22T06:38:00.000Z	acidrain	rattatoue	still not connecting
2012-02-22T06:38:00.000Z	acidrain		last time, i did some type of manual routing, which i have tried this time to the best of my knowledge
2012-02-22T06:38:00.000Z	rattatoue	acidrain	when you type ifconfig does it show an IP?
2012-02-22T06:39:00.000Z	acidrain	rattatoue	it will not show unless i manually set the DCHP reservation on the router for 192.168.1.107 and then set that ip as my box, but it still wont go online
2012-02-22T06:39:00.000Z	rattatoue	acidrain	okay one sec
2012-02-22T06:43:00.000Z	acidrain	rattatoue	it now shows inet addr: 192.168.1.107, but its not online, cannot connect to google.com
2012-02-22T06:43:00.000Z	rattatoue	acidrain	okay try this in terminal. Ping 74.125.225.111. And see what it says.
2012-02-22T06:45:00.000Z	acidrain	rattatoue	host unreachable
2012-02-22T06:45:00.000Z	rattatoue	acidrain	okay
2012-02-22T06:45:00.000Z	rattatoue	acidrain	when you type ifconfig you have a inet addr: right?
2012-02-22T06:45:00.000Z	acidrain	rattatoue	just to be clear, the gateway is my routers ip right?
2012-02-22T06:46:00.000Z	rattatoue	acidrain	yes
2012-02-22T06:46:00.000Z	acidrain	rattatoue	thats right, but i only have that because i have manually set it.
2012-02-22T06:46:00.000Z	acidrain	rattatoue	it says im connected, but really im not...
