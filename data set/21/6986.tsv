2008-07-10T07:52:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Jman	are you using 64bit?
2008-07-10T07:53:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Jman	why are you downloading rpms?
2008-07-10T07:53:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Jman	all the more reason you should be nstalling things the right way, as opposed to making it harder on yourself.
2008-07-10T07:54:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Jman	are you using 32bit or 64bit ubuntu
2008-07-10T07:54:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Jman	then it should install just like Windows... go to youtube, add missing plugins, install, then restart firefox.
2008-07-10T07:55:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Jman	opena  terminal (Applications/Accessories/terminal) and type this w/o quotes.. "uname -a"   and paste the output here
2008-07-10T07:56:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Jman	select adobe flash player, don't choose gnash.
2008-07-10T07:57:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Jman	stop linking us to that, i don't care.
2008-07-10T07:57:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Jman	are you going to follow instructions or not?
2008-07-10T07:58:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Jman	go to youtube.com and yous hould get a popup to install missing plug ins... click install.
2008-07-10T07:59:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Jman	then again, please listen... open a terminal.. (Applications/Accessories/Terminal), and type this w/o quotes. "uname -a" and paste the output here.. make sure there's a space before -
2008-07-10T08:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Jman	ok, you're using 32bit.
2008-07-10T08:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Jman	so now the question is, why can't you install flash, like 99% of other Linux users?
2008-07-10T08:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Jman	you don't seem like one...
