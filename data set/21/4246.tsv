2009-01-18T03:34:00.000Z	yaris123456789		cp -R
2009-01-18T03:35:00.000Z	yaris123456789		ok
2009-01-18T03:36:00.000Z	jrib	yaris123456789	do you have some cp alias setup or something?
2009-01-18T03:38:00.000Z	jrib	yaris123456789	it's a good idea to have it aliased, you can use /bin/cp instead of cp for this time
2009-01-18T03:38:00.000Z	yaris123456789	jrib	so how to do this
2009-01-18T03:39:00.000Z	jrib	yaris123456789	if you are sure you know what you are doing, just write '/bin/cp' instead of 'cp' in your command
2009-01-18T03:40:00.000Z	jrib	yaris123456789	what are you copying exactly?
2009-01-18T03:40:00.000Z	yaris123456789	jrib	bunch of text files in a folder to another folder containig text files....there are some duplicate files that wants overwrite
2009-01-18T03:45:00.000Z	jrib	yaris123456789	just use /bin/cp like I said
2009-01-18T03:46:00.000Z	jrib	yaris123456789	runderwo: there really isn't much point in copying cp like that
2009-06-06T15:23:00.000Z	jrib	yaris123456789	nohup COMMAND, or COMMAND & disown
2009-06-06T15:24:00.000Z	yaris123456789	jrib	thanks
2009-06-06T15:25:00.000Z	jrib	yaris123456789	nohup is good if you want the output stored somewhere
2009-06-06T15:28:00.000Z	yaris123456789	jrib	thanks. & disown doe the trick
2009-06-06T15:32:00.000Z	jrib	yaris123456789	we send them out when people abuse the enter key
2009-06-06T15:33:00.000Z	yaris123456789	jrib	disown doesn't work....argh
2009-06-06T15:33:00.000Z	jrib	yaris123456789	yes it does
2009-06-06T15:33:00.000Z	yaris123456789	jrib	the script calls other programs like wget
2009-06-06T15:33:00.000Z	jrib	yaris123456789	shouldn't matter
2009-06-06T15:33:00.000Z	yaris123456789	jrib	when i do php run.php & disown
2009-06-06T15:34:00.000Z	jrib	yaris123456789	disown just tells your shell not to care about it anymore
