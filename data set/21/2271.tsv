2009-11-21T03:13:00.000Z	Will123456		(do you guys know when crunchbang will be updated to the ubuntu 9.10 base?)
2009-11-21T03:14:00.000Z	faryshta	Will123456	never!
2009-11-21T03:18:00.000Z	Will123456	faryshta	re: crunchbang/9.10 - why never? :O
2009-11-21T03:19:00.000Z	faryshta	Will123456	if they don't have it now that 9.10 has been released probably will never have it. Once released they only make security updates. But that don't mean you can't install it.
2009-11-21T03:20:00.000Z	Will123456	faryshta	crunchbang is a linux distro based on ubuntu
2009-11-21T03:22:00.000Z	faryshta	Will123456	they seem to release crunchbang 2 months after Ubuntu.
2009-11-21T03:23:00.000Z	Will123456	faryshta	yeah... looks like i'll just have to install openbox on fedora and pretend it's crunchbang/ubuntu
2009-11-21T03:23:00.000Z	faryshta	Will123456	just out of curiosity. Why don't you install openbox in Ubuntu?
2009-11-21T03:27:00.000Z	faryshta	Will123456	are you having this problem? https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/467431
2009-11-21T03:30:00.000Z	faryshta	Will123456	did you check the launchpad I send you?
2009-11-21T03:30:00.000Z	Will123456	faryshta	i must have missed it, could you resent?
2009-11-21T03:31:00.000Z	faryshta	Will123456	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/467431
2009-11-21T03:33:00.000Z	Will123456	faryshta	looking at your launchpad link right now
2009-11-21T03:34:00.000Z	Will123456	faryshta	what do you want me to say? i'm not really sure if there's a work around...
2009-11-21T03:34:00.000Z	faryshta	Will123456	if you have the same problem.
2009-11-21T03:35:00.000Z	Will123456	faryshta	unfortunately i don't have any 64 bit AMD systems here right now- i do at my dad's, but that's a mile's walk away and it needs new RAM- which was the reason I couldn't install karmic 32 bit on it (it was a 1.5 gig ram system): have you done a mem test on your system/
2009-11-21T03:38:00.000Z	faryshta	Will123456	 you have the same problem?
2009-11-21T03:38:00.000Z	faryshta	Will123456	 you have two 64bits processors?
2009-11-21T03:38:00.000Z	Will123456	faryshta	my 64 bit processor is intel, but i've not tried karmic 64 bit on them.
2009-11-21T03:38:00.000Z	Will123456	faryshta	so i can't say i have had the problem - not had the chance to try. sorry.
2009-11-21T03:39:00.000Z	Will123456	faryshta	sorry! :P
