2011-06-17T17:36:00.000Z	dr_willis		theres commands to reset compiz. and unity
2011-06-17T17:37:00.000Z	dr_willis		gconftool-2 --recursive-unset /apps/compiz-1          resets compiz  then this resets uinty -->          unity --reset
2011-06-17T17:37:00.000Z	dr_willis		well i guess you can call them native. :)
2011-06-17T17:38:00.000Z	ciphergoth	dr_willis	will try that, thanks
2011-06-17T17:38:00.000Z	dr_willis		Ive been using some of the KDE irc clients ported to windows lately
2011-06-17T17:39:00.000Z	dr_willis		kvirc i think.
2011-06-17T17:39:00.000Z	ciphergoth	dr_willis	I'm back to exactly where I was before
2011-06-17T17:40:00.000Z	ciphergoth		Very very odd behaviour.  The tooltips appear where I would expect the icons to be, but far above where the mouse is - the lower the mouse, the greater the disparity
2011-06-17T17:40:00.000Z	dr_willis	Clerisy	 alt-f2 run 'compiz --replace'
2011-06-17T17:40:00.000Z	ciphergoth		Is there an equivalent of pastebin for screenshots?
2011-06-17T17:41:00.000Z	dr_willis	Clerisy	 try it from a terminal window. look for error messages, try alt-f2 and 'metacity --replace' also
2011-06-17T17:42:00.000Z	dr_willis	Clerisy	 meticity is  not exactly a 'fix' its the window manager without all the fancy eyecandy
2011-06-17T17:43:00.000Z	dr_willis	Clerisy	 compiz requires the proper 3d drivers also. metacity does not.
2011-06-17T17:43:00.000Z	ciphergoth		This is what I can see: http://imagebin.org/158724
2011-06-17T17:44:00.000Z	dr_willis		!controls | Clerisy
2011-06-17T17:44:00.000Z	ciphergoth		it's blank all the way down apart form that detail at the top
2011-06-17T17:44:00.000Z	ciphergoth		I don't have much config I care about, so I'm happy to wipe and restart, but I don't want to lose eg my IM accounts
2011-06-17T17:45:00.000Z	ciphergoth		I've tried unity --replace and unity --replace-icons and compiz --replace and logging in and out and deleting my compiz config
2011-06-17T17:46:00.000Z	dr_willis		make a new user - see if it actually works for them
2011-06-17T17:46:00.000Z	ciphergoth	dr_willis	you mean me?
