2008-10-15T02:36:00.000Z	Some_Person		How big should a swap partition be for Ubuntu64 with 4GB of RAM?
2008-10-15T02:37:00.000Z	dulakian	Some_Person	if you have the space, use 4g swap, if not, 1-2g would be fine
2008-10-15T02:38:00.000Z	dulakian	Some_Person	hibernation would require 4g, it would dump all ram to the swap
2008-10-15T02:39:00.000Z	dulakian	Some_Person	you can still have less swap, you just have to suspend instead of hibernate
2008-10-15T02:41:00.000Z	dulakian	Some_Person	I run a lot of server machines with 5g / so 11g should be plenty
2008-10-15T02:42:00.000Z	Some_Person	dulakian	Keep in mind this isn't a server machine, I would have a GUI and everything
2008-10-15T02:42:00.000Z	dulakian	Some_Person	I install full gui on the servers so I can remote desktop, it works and it's plenty of space
2008-10-15T02:43:00.000Z	Some_Person	dulakian	64 or 32? I am talking about 64
2008-10-15T02:43:00.000Z	dulakian	Some_Person	I just dont' have the gui running on the server 24/7, I turn it off when I'm not active on that machine
2008-10-15T02:43:00.000Z	dulakian	Some_Person	I'm running 32
2008-10-15T02:43:00.000Z	Some_Person	dulakian	Do you think 64 would need more space?
2008-10-15T02:44:00.000Z	dulakian	Some_Person	I doubt it would be that big a difference
2008-10-15T02:44:00.000Z	dulakian	Some_Person	On my workstation here I am using 3.2g and I have all kinds of crap installed
2008-10-15T02:48:00.000Z	dulakian	Some_Person	what kind of laptop is it?
2008-10-15T02:48:00.000Z	Some_Person	dulakian	Gateway M-6866
2008-10-15T02:49:00.000Z	dulakian	Some_Person	scd0 would be a scsi cdrom drive, so I'm guessing your cdrom drive is on the sata controller
2008-10-15T02:49:00.000Z	Some_Person	dulakian	ah, that would explain it. Could also be my SD card slot perhaps
2008-10-15T02:50:00.000Z	dulakian	Some_Person	yeah but it's weird for an sd card to show up as scd, it would normally just be sd
2008-10-15T02:50:00.000Z	Some_Person	dulakian	Well why would a CD drive appear unallocated?
2008-10-15T02:50:00.000Z	Some_Person	dulakian	Note that I am running off the Live CD
2008-10-15T02:51:00.000Z	dulakian	Some_Person	no idea, laptop hardware is a little weird sometimes, but scd0 is a scsi cdrom device
