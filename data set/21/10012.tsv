2005-05-29T07:14:00.000Z	_kevin		i noticed if you leave Ubuntu runnin on over night or for like more then a day it slows down alot
2005-05-29T07:14:00.000Z	_kevin		and the Nautulis thingy keeps crashing
2005-05-29T07:14:00.000Z	_kevin		if u leave it on for a long time
2005-05-29T07:14:00.000Z	hondje	_kevin	Hoary?
2005-05-29T07:15:00.000Z	hondje	_kevin	interesting...are you using it for desktop or server?
2005-05-29T07:17:00.000Z	hondje	_kevin	instead of rebooting, try restarting X by doing ctrl-alt-backspace
2005-05-29T07:17:00.000Z	hondje	_kevin	yes, though there's some 'save the setup' button
2005-05-29T08:38:00.000Z	hondje	_kevin	You'll be a genius before you know it
2005-05-29T08:39:00.000Z	hondje	_kevin	Easy to do :)
2005-06-13T08:40:00.000Z	hondje	_kevin	for repositories or your harddrive?
2005-06-13T08:41:00.000Z	hondje	_kevin	try locate
2005-06-14T09:47:00.000Z	hondje	_kevin	basically it's debian with newer desktop pkgs
2005-06-14T09:51:00.000Z	hondje	_kevin	nethack
2005-06-14T09:54:00.000Z	hondje	_kevin	for non-games, you'd probably be better off using wine
2005-06-18T06:03:00.000Z	hondje	_kevin	any reason you can't use scp?
2005-06-18T06:04:00.000Z	hondje	_kevin	the winscp
2005-06-18T06:05:00.000Z	hondje	_kevin	all you have to do for that is sudo apt-get install ssh, download winscp, and read the commnads - way simple too
2005-06-18T06:09:00.000Z	_kevin	hondje	i download  winscp on the linux machine and install it but ./configure make and make install ?
2005-06-18T06:10:00.000Z	hondje	_kevin	no, winscp on the windows machine :)
2005-06-18T06:21:00.000Z	_kevin	hondje	now that i have ssh and winscp ont he window machine
2005-06-18T06:22:00.000Z	hondje	_kevin	I haven't ever used winscp, just know everyone likes it :)
