2005-09-22T05:59:00.000Z	rob^	brenner	no it cant
2005-09-22T06:00:00.000Z	brenner	rob^	yes it can
2005-09-22T06:00:00.000Z	rob^	brenner	no, actually it cant
2005-09-22T06:00:00.000Z	rob^	brenner	trust me I've tried
2005-09-22T06:01:00.000Z	brenner	rob^	that's news to me....i've installed ubuntu on 3 windows machines, all using the resize feature in the partitioning stage
2005-09-22T06:02:00.000Z	brenner	rob^	how did you do it?
2005-09-22T06:05:00.000Z	rob^	brenner	well apparently it can.. but it must not 100% of the time
2005-09-22T06:05:00.000Z	brenner	rob^	b/c i have 3 dualboot computers here, all have had their original NTFS partition resized, and i haven't used partition magic, qtparted or anything else other than the installer's partitioner
2005-09-22T06:06:00.000Z	brenner	rob^	did you select the size value?
2005-09-22T06:06:00.000Z	rob^	brenner	I dunno, its been a while
2005-09-22T06:07:00.000Z	rob^	brenner	word is that it does, but it doesn't always work.
2005-09-22T06:07:00.000Z	brenner	rob^	yeah, just saw this: "If, when you are trying to shrink your partition, you are not given the option to enter a smaller size, it is because the installer does not feel it is able to resize the partition. Possibly because it thinks it is full, is currupt, or has some other problems that it cannot solve."
2005-09-22T06:08:00.000Z	brenner	rob^	maybe i've been lucky
2005-09-22T06:08:00.000Z	rob^	brenner	no it still gave me the option, but it didn't actually work when I went with it
2005-09-22T06:09:00.000Z	brenner	rob^	you got to the point where you enter a new size?
2005-09-22T06:09:00.000Z	rob^	brenner	like I said, I'm not sure but its not 100% affective
2005-09-22T06:10:00.000Z	brenner	rob^	well, i'm changing the trigger back....if only for the sake that it *is* possible....i can add a disclaimer about it not always being possible though
2005-09-22T06:14:00.000Z	brenner	rob^	cheers
2005-09-22T06:15:00.000Z	rob^	brenner	np happy to be corrected, also that wiki page is better then the original one
