2010-05-17T18:53:00.000Z	DrGrov		Hello and good day
2010-05-17T18:53:00.000Z	DrGrov		Gotta ask that can I run both KDE and GNOME on Ubuntu 10.04?
2010-05-17T18:53:00.000Z	DrGrov		huomenta WePanicForYou
2010-05-17T18:53:00.000Z	DrGrov		hi onetinsoldier
2010-05-17T18:53:00.000Z	Galerien	DrGrov	yes, but I never did...
2010-05-17T18:54:00.000Z	DrGrov	Galerien	ah. I perhaps understand you why not KDE 4.x... ;)
2010-05-17T18:57:00.000Z	DrGrov	Galerien	perhaps you would like to evaluate my current computer with what I put together?
2010-05-17T18:58:00.000Z	Galerien	DrGrov	well, I told you that I know we can, some of my friend did, but I don't know how...
2010-05-17T19:00:00.000Z	DrGrov	Galerien	my current computer is a 2 dual core AMD Opteron 64 model 280 CPU's, a 30GB SolidState HDD for root and swap, 250GB 2,5" laptop HDD which is insanely fast (SATA2 7200rpm), Nvidia GTS250 1GB GPU...
2010-05-17T19:01:00.000Z	Galerien	DrGrov	yeah... so?
2010-05-17T19:01:00.000Z	DrGrov	Galerien	just though I'd ask what you thought.
2010-05-17T19:01:00.000Z	DrGrov	Galerien	since you were speaking about computer stuff....
2010-05-17T19:01:00.000Z	Galerien	DrGrov	well, ok
2010-05-17T19:03:00.000Z	DrGrov	Galerien	what you think about that setup?
2010-05-17T19:03:00.000Z	Galerien	DrGrov	Swap on your SolidState is a good idea for performances, but not for your money, It will weaken it faster... beside that, I've got nothing to say, except that you might have had a better deal with an Intel CPU
2010-05-17T19:03:00.000Z	DrGrov	Galerien	I just paid 650 euros for that setup. 8GB ram of course.
2010-05-17T19:04:00.000Z	DrGrov	Galerien	it is built out of a HP xw9300 Workstation
2010-05-17T19:04:00.000Z	Galerien	DrGrov	8 GB ram? Do you like creating heavy 3D stuff or having 4 differents of runing at the same time :D ??
2010-05-17T19:05:00.000Z	DrGrov	Galerien	I keep running a lot of VMWare for testing purposes. Like to really multitask stuff.
2010-05-17T19:06:00.000Z	Galerien	DrGrov	I don't think your CPU is fast enough to use all of it with efficiency :D
2010-05-17T19:07:00.000Z	DrGrov	Galerien	thanks for telling good pointers.
