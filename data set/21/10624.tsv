2005-02-06T08:25:00.000Z	randabis		I learn more and more each day
2005-02-06T08:26:00.000Z	randabis		linux-headers should already be in the source directory
2005-02-06T08:26:00.000Z	randabis		hams do you mean /usr/src or /usr/src/linux?
2005-02-06T08:26:00.000Z	randabis		linux-headers should be in /usr/src/
2005-02-06T08:27:00.000Z	randabis		they do not need to be moved into the kernel source directory
2005-02-06T08:28:00.000Z	randabis		hams I doubt it failed
2005-02-06T08:28:00.000Z	randabis		you just don't know about it
2005-02-06T08:29:00.000Z	randabis		when you install linux-source, it does not extract the source...it merely places a tarball into the /usr/src/ directory
2005-02-06T08:29:00.000Z	randabis		it should have... you should have a linux source directory and a linux headers directory
2005-02-06T08:29:00.000Z	randabis		is that what you have?
2005-02-06T08:31:00.000Z	farruinn	randabis	would that make sense if he can get to the login screen though?
2005-02-06T08:32:00.000Z	randabis	farruinn	I was having a similar problem on my sister's machine (hoary as well)...it was because of her driver so that's why I suggested that
2005-02-20T17:52:00.000Z	randabis	farruinn	doubt it
2005-02-20T17:54:00.000Z	farruinn	randabis	hahah
2005-02-20T17:54:00.000Z	farruinn	randabis	that'd just be silly! ;)
2005-02-20T17:57:00.000Z	farruinn	randabis	yeah, some hfs+ - some directories show up as files :D, but I'll deal with that later
2005-02-25T12:07:00.000Z	farruinn	randabis	eh, whatever, never used gentoo ;)
2005-02-27T08:39:00.000Z	farruinn	randabis	yeah, it's friggen weird, in INSTALL is just says run ./configure but there is none
2005-02-28T06:00:00.000Z	randabis	farruinn	agreed
2005-05-05T15:41:00.000Z	randabis	farruinn	because ubuntu's firefox is crap unfortunately :/
2005-05-06T10:50:00.000Z	randabis	farruinn	there seems to have been an escape from the nearest mental institution
