2010-01-31T02:55:00.000Z	mobius2		greetings
2010-01-31T02:56:00.000Z	mobius2		I have made certain that my username has a check placed beside the  "allowed to use audio devices" in the users and groups settings  however I can only hear audio when I am logged in as a root
2010-01-31T02:57:00.000Z	mobius2		Coach j you might need to specify  your actual  disc burner and  not the default  image burner
2010-01-31T02:59:00.000Z	mobius2		frozen pencil did you lose power unexpectedly?
2010-01-31T03:01:00.000Z	mobius2		I am quite baffled at  why I can only hear sound when Im root
2010-01-31T03:01:00.000Z	mobius2		I check the box which allows me to  use audio devices
2010-01-31T03:02:00.000Z	pfifo	mobius2	check 2 things that your user is in the audio group and that /dev/audio is owned by the audio group
2010-01-31T03:15:00.000Z	pfifo	mobius2	check 2 things that your user is in the audio group and that /dev/audio is owned by the audio group
2010-01-31T03:15:00.000Z	mobius2	pfifo	and by "audio group"  what do you mean?   I looked in the drop down menu off from  system administration and users
2010-01-31T03:16:00.000Z	mobius2	pfifo	the box is checked which allows my username to   "use audio devices"
2010-01-31T03:16:00.000Z	pfifo	mobius2	pull up a terminal and run 'ls -la /dev/audio' and then run 'groups', paste the result
2010-01-31T03:18:00.000Z	mobius2	pfifo	okay
2010-01-31T03:22:00.000Z	pfifo	mobius2	its all setup correctly, try 'ls -la /dev/mixer'
