2006-05-11T13:25:00.000Z	xapaho		noone ever use partimage?
2006-05-11T13:26:00.000Z	soundray	xapaho	I have, why?
2006-05-11T13:32:00.000Z	xapaho	soundray	bbrazil sorry I was next door -- trying to use partimaged -L on breezy, so that partimagessl @ systemrescuecd 0.2.19 passes the first screen. but then right after connection, partimaged returns "segmentation error". any help pls ?
2006-05-11T13:33:00.000Z	soundray	xapaho	that sounds like something
2006-05-11T13:33:00.000Z	xapaho	soundray	are you playing some music right now ? :)
2006-05-11T13:34:00.000Z	soundray	xapaho	no, the sound in my nick is inaudible ;)
2006-05-11T13:35:00.000Z	xapaho	soundray	what did u mean it "sounds like something" ... you heard before ?
2006-05-11T13:36:00.000Z	soundray	xapaho	no, I interrupted myself, because I was going to say the same thing as bbrazil
2006-05-11T13:36:00.000Z	soundray	xapaho	afaik, the network part of partimage is still experimental.
2006-05-11T13:37:00.000Z	soundray	xapaho	segmentation fault is the same as a "general protection fault" in windows.
2006-05-11T13:37:00.000Z	xapaho	soundray	bbrazil ok, so what should I use ? for backup from multi-os laptop, and before hard drive replacement on a laptop
2006-05-11T13:38:00.000Z	soundray	xapaho	make backups with partimage locally, and copy them to another machine with scp
2006-05-11T13:39:00.000Z	soundray	xapaho	or mount a filesystem on the server (smb or nfs) and tell partimage to write to that.
2006-05-11T13:39:00.000Z	xapaho	soundray	what with a m$ laptop (the one which HD needs replacement asap) ?
2006-05-11T13:40:00.000Z	xapaho	soundray	could i tell partimage to file to ftp ? got one up and running almready
2006-05-11T13:40:00.000Z	soundray	xapaho	same thing -- partimage will back up a NTFS or FAT32 partition
2006-05-11T13:40:00.000Z	soundray	xapaho	you could ftp the image after the fact. That would be easiest.
2006-05-11T13:41:00.000Z	xapaho	soundray	i was late answering, that was just to say i can't save locally and transfer later
2006-05-11T13:41:00.000Z	soundray	xapaho	have you booted the laptop with a live CD?
2006-05-11T13:42:00.000Z	soundray	xapaho	again, I second bbrazil
2006-05-11T13:42:00.000Z	xapaho	soundray	systemrescue, gentoo based console and graphical text, looks damn good
