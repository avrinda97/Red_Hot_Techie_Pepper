2006-10-20T10:44:00.000Z	fdsd		Hey guys, I have a script launching at boot, in the console, yet it keeps getting interuptted by messages.. how do I turn that off?
2006-10-20T10:44:00.000Z	fdsd		anyone know?
2006-10-20T10:44:00.000Z	prav33n	fdsd	What you mean by interrupted?
2006-10-20T10:44:00.000Z	prav33n	fdsd	What messages?
2006-10-20T10:44:00.000Z	fdsd	prav33n	its the kernel messages and its an interactive script, and it puts text all over it
2006-10-20T10:45:00.000Z	prav33n	fdsd	Try passing quiet option to the kernel parameters on boot
2006-10-20T10:45:00.000Z	fdsd	prav33n	ok
2006-10-20T10:46:00.000Z	prav33n	fdsd	What sort of script is yours?
2006-10-20T10:48:00.000Z	fdsd	prav33n	it uses dialog, I made a livecd that boots up to the console, and starts my script which backs up data from a failing Hfsplus volume (mac) and backs it up to a known good drive.
2006-10-20T10:51:00.000Z	prav33n	fdsd	If you are invoking it as initscript, try promoting the order of the start
2006-10-20T10:52:00.000Z	fdsd	prav33n	its not an init script, it launches with bash, it also doesnt matter when it starts, if the kernel spits out a message I am going to see it on screen.
2006-10-20T10:52:00.000Z	prav33n	fdsd	I think that is the case with any application
2006-10-20T10:52:00.000Z	prav33n	fdsd	What kind of message is spit out
2006-10-20T10:53:00.000Z	prav33n	fdsd	In quiet mode kernel doesn't spit unless it is a critical one
2006-10-20T10:53:00.000Z	fdsd	prav33n	like for example, if I plug in a firewire harddrive it starts spitting out sda: ieexxx blah all over the scripty
2006-10-20T10:54:00.000Z	prav33n	fdsd	That is interesting
2006-10-20T10:54:00.000Z	prav33n	fdsd	Normally in quiet mode these messages don't come
2006-10-20T10:54:00.000Z	fdsd	prav33n	ill try it
2006-10-20T10:54:00.000Z	prav33n	fdsd	Please ensure that you have quiet added to the parameters of the kernel
2006-10-20T10:54:00.000Z	fdsd	prav33n	ill try it
2006-10-20T10:55:00.000Z	prav33n	fdsd	OK
