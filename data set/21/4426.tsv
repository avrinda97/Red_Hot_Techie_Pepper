2008-05-02T16:53:00.000Z	fiyawerx		How to: Xubuntu - Thunar Native Windows Network Browsing
2008-05-02T16:54:00.000Z	fiyawerx		I wonder if people try to look up answers on their own at all before hopping into irc to ask
2008-05-02T16:54:00.000Z	fiyawerx		chances are 99% of them have been asked and documented already
2008-05-02T16:55:00.000Z	crash91	fiyawerx	well i certainly couldnt find an answer for this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=772650
2008-05-02T16:55:00.000Z	crash91	fiyawerx	i google before asking
2008-05-02T16:56:00.000Z	crash91	fiyawerx	i cant install themes at all...i even used the svn repo
2008-05-02T16:57:00.000Z	fiyawerx	crash91	the only one I know works for sure (as its the onyl one i installed) is this one - http://themes.beryl-project.org/theme_details.php?id=65
2008-05-02T16:59:00.000Z	crash91	fiyawerx	cant see it, blank window
2008-05-02T17:00:00.000Z	fiyawerx	crash91	if you run emerald-theme-manager from the console, do you see any errors there when you try to import at heme?
2008-05-02T17:01:00.000Z	crash91	fiyawerx	tar: /home/crash/.emerald/themes/Vista-Compiz: Cannot chdir: No such file or directory
2008-05-02T17:01:00.000Z	crash91	fiyawerx	aha! so is it a tar error?
2008-05-02T17:02:00.000Z	fiyawerx	crash91	try to cd into that directory, cd /home/crash/.emerald/themes
2008-05-02T17:03:00.000Z	crash91	fiyawerx	i had to sudo make the themes dir, maybe it is to do with write permission problems
2008-05-02T17:04:00.000Z	crash91	fiyawerx	tar: ./theme.screenshot.png: Cannot open: Permission denied
2008-05-02T17:05:00.000Z	fiyawerx	crash91	that would do it, the permissions
2008-05-02T17:06:00.000Z	fiyawerx	crash91	someone else can correct me but I believe it'd be sudo chown crash -R /home/crash/.emerald
2008-05-02T17:07:00.000Z	crash91	fiyawerx	nvm i used nautilus :) it works
2008-05-02T17:07:00.000Z	fiyawerx	crash91	used nautilus to change the permissions?
2008-05-02T17:07:00.000Z	crash91	fiyawerx	 yes
2008-05-02T17:10:00.000Z	crash91	fiyawerx	thanks for helping!
