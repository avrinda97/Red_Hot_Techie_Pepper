2006-03-14T13:59:00.000Z	Medlem		Hello! :)
2006-03-14T14:00:00.000Z	Medlem		I'm just trying out all programs in the gnome desktop in ubuntu :=)
2006-03-14T14:00:00.000Z	Medlem		I think i will :] 
2006-03-14T14:00:00.000Z	Medlem		Just now i love it
2006-03-14T14:00:00.000Z	Medlem		Not as messy as other dist i have tried.
2006-03-14T14:01:00.000Z	Medlem		"Oh no, do you find all my devices on my computer without me doing anything, im so mad" ^
2006-03-14T14:01:00.000Z	Medlem		Gotta find a guide so i can test all different kind of fun stuff :D
2006-03-14T14:02:00.000Z	Medlem		I will try that one. My gold is to get a environment where i can run both kde-desktop, xfce and gnome. :)
2006-03-14T14:03:00.000Z	elkbuntu	Medlem	you can do that with ubuntu easily
2006-03-14T14:04:00.000Z	elkbuntu	Medlem	sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop xubuntu-desktop
2006-03-14T14:04:00.000Z	Medlem	elkbuntu	I think so. I just havnt looked in the FAQs yet. Everything has been pressing a button or so. Not like gentoo where you have to spend a week reading about different flags.  Oh so i can just choose which session when i log in?
2006-03-14T14:05:00.000Z	elkbuntu	Medlem	i just told you how
2006-03-14T14:06:00.000Z	Medlem	elkbuntu	I know. :) But i heard from a friend that it will replace existing environment. But i can always try :] 
2006-03-14T14:16:00.000Z	elkbuntu	Medlem	laptop's specs?
2006-03-14T14:17:00.000Z	Medlem	elkbuntu	900mhz p3 192 ram, and real old harddrive. It is just the install part that is gonna kill it because the harddrive is so slow, managed to run kde on this laptop before without any problems :)
2006-03-14T14:18:00.000Z	elkbuntu	Medlem	it shouldnt hurt it too bad
2006-03-14T14:18:00.000Z	Medlem	elkbuntu	Haha, we can always hope that. The harddrive gonna die anyday soon :-)
2006-03-14T14:19:00.000Z	elkbuntu	Medlem	ebay time ;)
2006-03-14T14:19:00.000Z	Medlem	elkbuntu	haha. probably. :P
2006-03-14T14:21:00.000Z	Medlem	elkbuntu	Ok, like i supposed then. Well, you are a great source of information :] 
2006-03-14T14:23:00.000Z	elkbuntu	Medlem	as for kde, if you have another computer, avoid using the computer while you're installing the kubuntu package, to avoid undue stress on the system
