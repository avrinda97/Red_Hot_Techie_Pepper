2010-05-31T23:14:00.000Z	oCean_	simar	i remember i had similar problem, not using nvidia though. But I remember fn-keys not working, but -strangely- it worked using the brightness applet (on panel)
2010-05-31T23:16:00.000Z	simar	oCean_	hey what is brightness applet (on panel )???
2010-05-31T23:17:00.000Z	oCean_	simar	(when using gnome) > right-click panel, choose 'add to panel', choose 'brightness applet'
2010-05-31T23:18:00.000Z	simar	oCean_	mine is uneffected even in brightness applet ??? what to do
2010-05-31T23:19:00.000Z	simar	oCean_	i think we have to find out some script that runs what we press the function keys  ...!!
2010-05-31T23:20:00.000Z	oCean_	simar	don't really know.. I know, in /etc/acpi/events there's an asus-brightness-up (and -down) for me (I'm on asus atm)
2010-05-31T23:21:00.000Z	simar	oCean_	thanks for that .
2010-05-31T23:21:00.000Z	simar	oCean_	 now i think u don;t know the command that inc dec bright ness in nvidia x server???
2010-05-31T23:21:00.000Z	oCean_	simar	sorry, nope
2010-05-31T23:22:00.000Z	simar	oCean_	ok no problem /...
2010-05-31T23:22:00.000Z	simar	oCean_	hey whats acpi though ...
2010-05-31T23:23:00.000Z	oCean_	simar	"adv config and power interface" handles all those kind of events
2010-05-31T23:26:00.000Z	oCean_	simar	have you searched https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu for "nvidia brightness control" ? Might render some helpful info... (and in best case a patch)
2010-05-31T23:27:00.000Z	simar	oCean_	thats sounds useful .. wait i'm trying
2010-05-31T23:27:00.000Z	oCean_	simar	have to run, but good luck with that!
2010-06-04T14:53:00.000Z	simar	oCean_	could you please tell me that what is the purpose od | operator in linux ... i see it in many terminal commands .. what i know is that it is similar to < or > operator that redircts output from terminal to somewhere ??????
2010-06-04T14:55:00.000Z	oCean_	simar	it's a pipe. You can use it (for example) to "pipe" the output of command a through to command b. Like "ls -al" (lists all files) and "less" will let you scroll the output. So "ls -al | less" will do the trick combined
2010-06-04T14:57:00.000Z	oCean_	simar	you can also find a double pipe "||" in bash scripts, meaning 'OR', as opposed to &&, meaning 'AND'
2010-06-04T14:58:00.000Z	simar	oCean_	ya i know that
2010-06-04T14:59:00.000Z	simar	oCean_	can't we avoid pipeline if we sent output of ls to less which will gve its output independently ....  i mean what type of command if less .. it takes input and gives output ..???
2010-06-04T15:02:00.000Z	oCean_	simar	often there are more ways to get same desired result for many commands. Pipes can be used for any program capable of reading from STDIN.
