2007-12-24T21:36:00.000Z	amerio	nickrud	now I can see it but its unmounted
2007-12-24T21:36:00.000Z	nickrud	amerio	where do you see it?
2007-12-24T21:36:00.000Z	amerio	nickrud	in the computer window
2007-12-24T21:36:00.000Z	amerio	nickrud	& places
2007-12-24T21:37:00.000Z	nickrud	amerio	when you click it, does it mount?
2007-12-24T21:37:00.000Z	amerio	nickrud	nop , unable 2 mount
2007-12-24T21:38:00.000Z	nickrud	amerio	same problem then, I'm sure. try that mount command again in a terminal
2007-12-24T21:38:00.000Z	amerio	nickrud	how would windows fix it?
2007-12-24T21:40:00.000Z	nickrud	amerio	I don't know, I was serious about not knowing much about ntfs
2007-12-24T21:40:00.000Z	amerio	nickrud	as soon as its connected 2 windows then reconnect it to linux it will work?
2007-12-24T21:41:00.000Z	nickrud	amerio	I'd follow the instructions the mount command gave
2007-12-24T21:41:00.000Z	nickrud	amerio	I'm a slave to documentation, I figure the software writers normally know what they are doing
