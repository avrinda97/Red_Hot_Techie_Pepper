2011-10-26T22:24:00.000Z	meta-coder		Freenode uses ircd-seven-1.1.0. What package is this available as in Ubuntu Oneiric?
2011-10-26T22:25:00.000Z	SpaceWeed	meta-coder	did you install synpatic package manager and search for ircd-seven-1.1.0 ?
2011-10-26T22:26:00.000Z	meta-coder	SpaceWeed	didn't find it in the repositories.. perhaps it is as a different name?
2011-10-26T22:28:00.000Z	SpaceWeed	meta-coder	well what exactly do you need it for
2011-10-26T22:28:00.000Z	SpaceWeed	meta-coder	if you're looking for the IRC daemon, try ircd-irc2
2011-10-26T22:28:00.000Z	meta-coder	SpaceWeed	is it different from ircd-seven-1.1.0 ?
2011-10-26T22:29:00.000Z	SpaceWeed	meta-coder	I don't see that in the repos, you would probably have to get it from sourceforge
2011-10-26T22:30:00.000Z	SpaceWeed	meta-coder	http://rpm.pbone.net/index.php3/stat/3/srodzaj/1/search/ircd
2011-10-26T22:30:00.000Z	meta-coder	SpaceWeed	is this http://adipose.attenuate.org/~stephen/ircd-seven/  legit?
2011-10-26T22:30:00.000Z	meta-coder	SpaceWeed	How can I use the RPMs?
2011-10-26T22:31:00.000Z	SpaceWeed	meta-coder	RPM is red hat package manager, it should install with that
2011-10-26T22:31:00.000Z	meta-coder	SpaceWeed	 I need it on Ubuntu (Oneiric).
2011-10-26T22:32:00.000Z	SpaceWeed	meta-coder	you could install smart package manager which will work with rpm's in ubuntu
2011-10-26T22:33:00.000Z	meta-coder	SpaceWeed	Got it. http://freenode.net/seven.shtml
2011-10-26T22:34:00.000Z	meta-coder	SpaceWeed	https://dev.freenode.net/redmine/projects/ircd-seven
2011-10-26T22:34:00.000Z	SpaceWeed	meta-coder	so you could download the tar or add the repo
2011-10-26T22:35:00.000Z	meta-coder	SpaceWeed	./configure; make; make install. Right?
2011-10-26T22:35:00.000Z	SpaceWeed	meta-coder	yup
2011-10-26T22:35:00.000Z	SpaceWeed	meta-coder	if in doubt, check the install file or instructions in the tar
2011-10-26T22:41:00.000Z	meta-coder	SpaceWeed	Freenode is so much popular, shouldn't we have a ircd-seven package for Ubuntu? It is already GPLv2.
2011-10-26T22:42:00.000Z	SpaceWeed	meta-coder	uh, idk, talk to developers? they must have not seen a reason to include it in repos
