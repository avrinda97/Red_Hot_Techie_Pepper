2009-05-14T16:30:00.000Z	khaime		in trying to use qemu, i now try to use the cdrom to start the installation of the "guest", and i get this error : "you do not have enough space in '/dev/shm/ for the 256 mb of qemu virtual ram.  to have more space available provdided you have enough RAM and swap, do as root : umount /dev/shm"
2009-05-14T16:30:00.000Z	khaime		i did just that, and  it said that '/dev/shm' was "busy"
2009-05-14T16:31:00.000Z	gaveen	khaime	you can't unmount /dev/shm
2009-05-14T16:31:00.000Z	khaime	gaveen	so how do i take care of this "256 mb" problem ?
2009-05-14T16:32:00.000Z	gaveen	khaime	that means you don't have enough memory for the new VM
2009-05-14T16:32:00.000Z	khaime		can i do this : "mount -t tmpfs -o size=272m none /dev/shm" while "/dev/shm" is running ?
2009-05-14T16:32:00.000Z	gaveen		/dev/shm represents shared memory http://is.gd/zMN6
2009-05-14T16:34:00.000Z	khaime		how do i determine how much memory i have on my linux box
2009-05-14T16:34:00.000Z	khaime		i am certain it is at least 512..but how do i confirm
2009-05-14T16:34:00.000Z	gaveen	khaime	free -m
2009-05-14T16:35:00.000Z	gaveen	khaime	or check in the system monitor
2009-05-14T16:35:00.000Z	khaime		 total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached

2009-05-14T16:36:00.000Z	gaveen	khaime	means you have around 494MB memory in total
2009-05-14T16:36:00.000Z	gaveen	khaime	that's usually not enough memory to use in a desktop OS plus a 256MB VM
2009-05-14T16:37:00.000Z	khaime	gaveen	so what about "swap" why do it said used : 1443
2009-05-14T16:37:00.000Z	khaime	gaveen	thanks
2009-05-14T16:38:00.000Z	gaveen	khaime	that is you have about 1443 MB is swap space in total. Swap is something similar to virtual memory in Windows
