2008-09-14T15:30:00.000Z	pac1		any way to control the rotation speed of the cube in compiz?
2008-09-14T15:30:00.000Z	zoed	pac1	start compiz-config-settings-manager.
2008-09-14T15:31:00.000Z	pac1	zoed	its all check boxes.
2008-09-14T15:31:00.000Z	zoed	pac1	I mean: Advanced Desktop Effect Settings in System|Preferences|Advanced Desktop Effect settings.

2008-09-14T15:32:00.000Z	pac1		yes.  that's where compizConfig landed in hardy.
2008-09-14T15:33:00.000Z	zoed	pac1	ok, so start that app. Then click on "rotate cube"
2008-09-14T15:34:00.000Z	pac1		Aha! the icons are not just there to look pretty next to the check box!
2008-09-14T15:34:00.000Z	zoed	pac1	exactly, click right of the check box, on the "rotate cube" symbol
2008-09-14T15:35:00.000Z	zoed	pac1	You see the option "Speed" (almost at the bottom)?
2008-09-14T15:37:00.000Z	zoed	pac1	you managed to change the speed?
2008-09-14T15:38:00.000Z	pac1		Doesn't really slow down.  What's time step?
2008-09-14T15:38:00.000Z	zoed	pac1	when I set speed to an extremely high number, it takes very long to change desktops.
2008-09-14T15:39:00.000Z	zoed	pac1	sorry, if I set it to a very small number
2008-09-14T15:40:00.000Z	pac1		right.  .1 takes a few seconds
2008-09-14T15:41:00.000Z	pac1		it also slows down a lot when the cube is coming to a stop.  Any way to affect that?
2008-09-14T15:43:00.000Z	zoed	pac1	 I'm not sure. There are lots of options in compizconfig settings manager.
2008-09-14T15:43:00.000Z	zoed	pac1	maybe you want to ask in #compiz
2008-09-14T15:43:00.000Z	zoed		!compizconfigsettingsmanager
2008-09-14T15:43:00.000Z	zoed		!compiz
2008-09-14T15:43:00.000Z	zoed	pac1	sorry, #compiz-fusion
