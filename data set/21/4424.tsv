2008-05-21T21:40:00.000Z	bazhang	Ginetteann	could you pastebin your sources.list
2008-05-21T21:43:00.000Z	Ginetteann	bazhang	 where do I find that file?
2008-05-21T21:44:00.000Z	bazhang	Ginetteann	cat /etc/apt/sources.list and copy to paste.ubuntu.com then tell us the url
2008-05-21T21:48:00.000Z	Ginetteann	bazhang	 http://pastebin.ca/1024967
2008-05-21T21:48:00.000Z	bazhang	Ginetteann	thanks; looking now
2008-05-21T21:49:00.000Z	Ginetteann	bazhang	greatly appreciated.
2008-05-21T21:50:00.000Z	Ginetteann	bazhang	I will have to keep D/Cing because I have the PS3 and the box im using now sharing one wired connection.
2008-05-21T21:51:00.000Z	bazhang	Ginetteann	you need to edit the sources.list; put a # in front of the cd listing (1st one) and remove the #from the others then refresh (sudo apt-get update) and try again
2008-05-21T21:52:00.000Z	Ginetteann	bazhang	 let me clarify. you want me to comment out the very first line? And then remove every other # from the rest of the sources.list file?
2008-05-21T21:52:00.000Z	bazhang	Ginetteann	not familiar with ps3; is there a gui for that?
2008-05-21T21:53:00.000Z	Ginetteann	bazhang	 the PS3 has its own OS, the XMB. That has a GUI. And Ubuntu running on a PS3 also has a GUI.
2008-05-21T21:54:00.000Z	bazhang	Ginetteann	okay well then you can go into software sources and check the appropriate repos (minux backports most likely) and uncheck cd then refresh and try again to install
2008-05-21T21:54:00.000Z	bazhang	Ginetteann	there is also a #ubuntu-ps3 channel, though there are only about 8 people in it :)
2008-05-21T21:55:00.000Z	bazhang	Ginetteann	okay, this is a standard ubuntu gui though right?
2008-05-21T21:56:00.000Z	bazhang	Ginetteann	so go to system-->administartion-->software sources and set that up there
2008-05-21T21:59:00.000Z	bazhang	Ginetteann	you need to follow the path I laid out above
2008-05-21T22:00:00.000Z	Ginetteann	bazhang	 ikonia , it is really difficult to follow two different paths at the same time.
2008-05-21T22:00:00.000Z	bazhang	Ginetteann	him as I am leaving soon :)
2008-05-21T22:01:00.000Z	bazhang	Ginetteann	yeah him :)
