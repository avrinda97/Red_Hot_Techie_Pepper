2006-09-22T13:47:00.000Z	warlock		Does anyone know how to build a kernel with hz=1000 ?
2006-09-22T13:48:00.000Z	indigoblu	warlock	its in kernel settings when you do kernel configuration
2006-09-22T13:50:00.000Z	warlock	indigoblu	- mind helping me out? Having major issues, I run a 3.2 Pentium D x2, with 4gb ram - but the FPS on the game-serer is onfurtunatly limited to 250 (the HZ is set to 100~ I guess) - also I'm running ubuntu breezy 5.10
2006-09-22T13:50:00.000Z	indigoblu	warlock	what kernel are you using?
2006-09-22T13:51:00.000Z	warlock		How do I check the kernel now again?
2006-09-22T13:51:00.000Z	warlock		sorry - just woke up and feels like im having an bad hangover.
2006-09-22T13:51:00.000Z	warlock		Just what I though, indigoblu 2.6.12-10-686-smp
2006-09-22T13:52:00.000Z	warlock	indigoblu	- any ideas?
2006-09-22T13:53:00.000Z	indigoblu	warlock	so you are running Breezy?
2006-09-22T13:53:00.000Z	warlock		Yes
2006-09-22T13:53:00.000Z	indigoblu	warlock	amd64 or not?
2006-09-22T13:53:00.000Z	warlock		(Due to dapper not being the right distro to run on game servers, trust me. I've tested)
2006-09-22T13:53:00.000Z	warlock		No intel
2006-09-22T13:54:00.000Z	indigoblu	warlock	is this a colo or a home box?
2006-09-22T13:54:00.000Z	warlock		It's on 100/100mbit at my work.
2006-09-22T13:54:00.000Z	indigoblu	warlock	okay, do you have the kernel image downloaded?
2006-09-22T13:55:00.000Z	warlock	indigoblu	- could we take this on aim/quakenet perhaps? I'm not identifyed to the services here and I cannot pm you. I rather take this through pm - if it's ok with you?
2006-09-22T13:56:00.000Z	indigoblu	warlock	well im gonna tell you waht do in one long command line
2006-09-22T13:56:00.000Z	indigoblu	warlock	im figuring out what to do for the moment.
2006-09-22T13:56:00.000Z	warlock		ok - do you use aim/msn perhaps?
2006-09-22T13:57:00.000Z	indigoblu	warlock	go nuts (aim: vedas2)
