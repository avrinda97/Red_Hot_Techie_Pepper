2011-06-09T11:17:00.000Z	celthunder	meuslix	uhm what graphcis card?
2011-06-09T11:26:00.000Z	celthunder	meuslix	idk if ati has there own thing but you can use xrandr for dual displays
2011-06-09T11:27:00.000Z	celthunder	meuslix	try xrandr without any parameters for your video display names
2011-06-09T11:28:00.000Z	celthunder	meuslix	then xrandr --display <internal/firstdisplay> --mode <resolution you want> --display <display2> --mode <resolution you want --right-of <otherdisplay>
2011-06-09T11:29:00.000Z	celthunder	meuslix	then mess with the ati stuff or try the command i just gave you don't complain if stuff doesn't work if you don't like the solutions or don't at least try them though
2011-06-09T11:30:00.000Z	celthunder	meuslix	then replace it with where yo uwant it
2011-06-09T11:30:00.000Z	celthunder	meuslix	--left-of --above --below etc should all work and you can set to degree and on top of each other and etc
2011-06-09T11:31:00.000Z	celthunder	meuslix	btw most graphical stuff just runs the command line commands anyway not like you're doing much different
2011-06-09T11:32:00.000Z	celthunder	meuslix	what tool?
2011-06-09T11:32:00.000Z	celthunder	meuslix	lol i'm a bit of an ass...just ignore me :)
2011-06-09T11:35:00.000Z	celthunder	meuslix	that's a gnome thing..and btw :) it likely calls the same command i just gave you in some form
2011-06-09T11:35:00.000Z	celthunder	meuslix	nice
