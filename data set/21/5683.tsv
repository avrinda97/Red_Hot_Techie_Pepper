2007-11-18T22:18:00.000Z	ehird`	jrib	I did tell my real question. If you'd looked up you'd see it.
2007-11-18T22:19:00.000Z	jrib	ehird`	no, just repeat your question please.  I sent you the wrong factoid
2007-11-18T22:19:00.000Z	ehird`	jrib	there you go
2007-11-18T22:19:00.000Z	jrib	ehird`	is /home on its own partition?
2007-11-18T22:20:00.000Z	ehird`	jrib	nope
2007-11-18T22:20:00.000Z	ehird`	jrib	also i do not want EVERY file
2007-11-18T22:20:00.000Z	ehird`	jrib	just a few. Mainly my code.
2007-11-18T22:21:00.000Z	jrib	ehird`	then you have to back it up somehow or move it to its own partition
2007-11-18T22:21:00.000Z	ehird`	jrib	:|
2007-11-18T22:22:00.000Z	ehird`	jrib	can't i boot from the ubuntu livecd and tell it to put them in RAM? I have enough RAM to store all of it, it's just text
2007-11-18T22:22:00.000Z	jrib	ehird`	even if you could, 1) it would be dangerous and 2) it would not be straighforward
2007-11-18T22:23:00.000Z	jrib	ehird`	upload it somewhere if you don't have something like a usb stick or spare CDs
2007-11-18T22:43:00.000Z	jrib	ehird`	you shouldn't ever need to reinstall
2007-11-18T22:50:00.000Z	ehird`	jrib	I'm going Kubuntu->Ubuntu
2007-11-18T22:50:00.000Z	jrib	ehird`	why do you not just install ubuntu-desktop?
2007-11-18T22:51:00.000Z	ehird`	jrib	start clean, got lots of crap on here
