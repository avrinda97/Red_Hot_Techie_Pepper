2007-08-09T07:04:00.000Z	macogw	ribando	its the desktop environment that kubuntu uses
2007-08-09T07:04:00.000Z	macogw	ribando	very configurable
2007-08-09T07:04:00.000Z	macogw	ribando	ubuntu uses gnome, which is a bit simpler
2007-08-09T07:06:00.000Z	ribando	macogw	Khrajin  its for Kubuntu?but, Khrajin ur using it in ubuntu :s...I didnt know that could be done!
2007-08-09T07:06:00.000Z	macogw	ribando	sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
2007-08-09T07:07:00.000Z	ribando	macogw	I'm I going to be able to use compiz fusion?
2007-08-09T07:07:00.000Z	macogw	ribando	i dont know. im just saying thats how you get kde on ubuntu
2007-08-09T07:08:00.000Z	ribando	macogw	i think I'll give it a try...
2007-08-09T07:08:00.000Z	ribando	macogw	I think my big problem is that Vista changes the BIOS settings, that's why it gets crazy with ubuntu
2007-08-09T07:09:00.000Z	macogw	ribando	no idea.  vista ate my ubuntu 2x so i decided 4 days testing the release candidate was long enough
2007-08-09T07:10:00.000Z	ribando	macogw	if u dual boot, one OS shouldnt have anything to do with the other, but then, I tried dual boot on the same machine, Ubuntu 7.04 with WinXPPro, and it worked fine. but when I try Ubuntu/Vista, I get all sorts of complications, from no sound, to no wifi connectivity and no desktop effects.lol
2007-08-09T07:11:00.000Z	ribando	macogw	I didnt really get the part were u said that u decided 4 days testing the release candidate was long enough.lol
2007-08-09T07:39:00.000Z	macogw	ribando	i think AWN is the more stable of the two, but i havent tried it.  kiba crashes every time a setting is changed
2007-08-09T07:40:00.000Z	ribando	macogw	I have used both of them, and they're both not very good to use right now.lol
2007-08-09T07:42:00.000Z	ribando	macogw	I've just finished my testing on the AWN, and removed it 5 minutes ago..lol...when I was still using it, the firefox web browser would just close over nothing, just suddenly.lol, and more...when I was watching a video, streaming on the web, after a little while, the video would start playing in slow motion with distorted sound, and then, would play fine, and then distorted again...
2007-08-09T07:43:00.000Z	macogw	ribando	so basically, avoid them both
2007-08-09T07:43:00.000Z	ribando	macogw	it was just way too much trouble...just to get the system
2007-08-09T07:43:00.000Z	ribando	macogw	it was just way too much trouble...just to get the system
2007-08-09T07:43:00.000Z	ribando	macogw	it was just way too much trouble...just to get the desktop kinda like looking like mac OS.lol
2007-08-09T07:44:00.000Z	macogw	ribando	ewwww macosx
2007-08-09T07:44:00.000Z	ribando	macogw	ahahahahahha..honestly, I dont understand why people like that.lol
