2006-12-11T06:42:00.000Z	reverseblade		What happens if I install 32-bit ubuntu into a AMD 64 bit machine ?
2006-12-11T06:42:00.000Z	reverseblade		does it work ?
2006-12-11T06:42:00.000Z	stefg	reverseblade	It#ll probably just work :-)
2006-12-11T06:43:00.000Z	reverseblade	stefg	is 64 bit support of ubuntu ok ? is it usable enough for general desktop ?
2006-12-11T06:45:00.000Z	stefg	reverseblade	the problem isn't ubuntu... 1.) Not much software today is really taking advantage of 64 bit 2.) all the closed source stuff is genrally only available as 32 bit binaries... So get 64 bit if you only need free software. but for convinience and interoperability 32bit is a better choice
2006-12-11T06:47:00.000Z	stefg	reverseblade	yes. As you became more skilled you can even have a hybrid system. 64bit in general, but 32-bit libs for the CS-stuf
2006-12-11T06:47:00.000Z	reverseblade	stefg	what about configure make make install procedure. does it remain the same ?
2006-12-11T06:48:00.000Z	stefg	reverseblade	of course
2006-12-27T11:06:00.000Z	reverseblade	stefg	ok but how can I remove that from being updated then ?
2006-12-27T11:04:00.000Z	stefg	reverseblade	no, if you don't know how to edit /boot/grub/menu.lst... since you decided to leave the stock-kernel anyways, it's your own responsibility to have your kernel updated
2006-12-27T11:04:00.000Z	reverseblade	stefg	I know how to edit it. I just am afraiding breaking up things with this update
2006-12-27T11:06:00.000Z	stefg	reverseblade	that's what i was going to tell you... no use in  downloading 30+ MB when you're not gonna use them. and it *will* touch your menu.lst
2006-12-27T11:07:00.000Z	stefg	reverseblade	if you have installed your custom-kernel with apt then simply apt-get remove remove linux-image-[arch] 
2006-12-27T11:08:00.000Z	reverseblade	stefg	yeah thats true
2006-12-27T11:08:00.000Z	reverseblade	stefg	but  I am afraiding if it removes some thing else
2006-12-27T11:09:00.000Z	stefg	reverseblade	if your custom-kernel is generated by kpkg then apt knows what to do... if you simplky threw it on your system, bypassing apt, then it might be dangerous
2006-12-27T11:10:00.000Z	reverseblade	stefg	yes I installed it via kpgk
2006-12-27T11:11:00.000Z	stefg	reverseblade	so just get rid of the whole stock-kernel-packages and restricted and headers and stuff... you'll never be bothered then again with ubuntu-kernel updates
2006-12-27T11:11:00.000Z	reverseblade	stefg	does it matter if I do it via Synaptic ?
2006-12-27T11:12:00.000Z	stefg	reverseblade	no
2007-06-19T13:40:00.000Z	reverseblade	stefg	no
