2005-07-05T06:39:00.000Z	mikeworking		I am new. May I post my question here? It's regarding a laptop with no floppy or CDROM, but has net conn. and can boot from 64MB USB Memory Stick.
2005-07-05T06:41:00.000Z	mikeworking		I want to install Ubuntu on the only laptop my boss would give me -- it has only a net conn. and 64MB usb mem stick. The hard drive has -- uck -- Win XP. I want to format the hard drive and replace it with Ubuntu.
2005-07-05T06:41:00.000Z	bodly	mikeworking	that should be possible
2005-07-05T06:43:00.000Z	bodly	mikeworking	i'm not sure if there's a mini ubuntu installer, but you could install debian and use that to "upgrade" to ubuntu
2005-07-05T06:44:00.000Z	bodly	mikeworking	last I checked, the debian net-install cd is 40 mb or so
2005-07-05T06:45:00.000Z	mikeworking	bodly	yikes. What if I create a mini USB linux, get some IP, format /dev/hda1, mount nfs to a remote Ubuntu CD, download bytes, then reboot and begin the install?
2005-07-05T06:45:00.000Z	bodly	mikeworking	that should work
2005-07-05T06:46:00.000Z	mikeworking	bodly	I have Ubuntu CDROM 5.04 with me, so no need to download over my DSL connection.
2005-07-05T06:46:00.000Z	mikeworking	bodly	I also have several Linux and Win systems on a DHCP net here that can help me, each with CDROMs.
2005-07-05T06:47:00.000Z	bodly	mikeworking	I've never done it, but I know you can use pxe boot to install debian
2005-07-05T06:48:00.000Z	mikeworking	bodly	I was thinking in the interest of time, plus the fact I don't have Debian on me and would have to download over DSL, that it might be better to come up with another solution.
2005-07-05T06:51:00.000Z	bodly	mikeworking	take a look at this:  http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-29358.html
2005-07-05T06:57:00.000Z	mikeworking	bodly	Thanks for the article. The article got me thinking...Here's my response...
2005-07-05T06:59:00.000Z	mikeworking	bodly	I can get Windows to connect to another system with CDROM. And then I could download the whole thing to the drive.
2005-07-05T07:00:00.000Z	bodly	mikeworking	ah, ok.  then what?  boot off of the usb drive and mount the iso ?
2005-07-05T07:00:00.000Z	mikeworking	bodly	sounds like a plan, right?
2005-07-05T07:01:00.000Z	bodly	mikeworking	yeah, should work
2005-07-05T07:01:00.000Z	mikeworking	bodly	in fact, I could boot from PCDOS on 64MB USB mem stick pretty easily, I bet.
2005-07-05T07:01:00.000Z	bodly	mikeworking	yeah, should work.  :-)
2005-07-05T07:01:00.000Z	mikeworking	bodly	Or would I need to boot from a USB linux and then run from there?
2005-07-05T07:07:00.000Z	bodly	mikeworking	i think that if you were to boot with freedos off your usb thingy, you should be able to get it to work as in that article
