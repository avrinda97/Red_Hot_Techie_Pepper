2006-03-07T08:43:00.000Z	Ries		can I install ubuntu with a other kernel then the one supplied on my CD?
2006-03-07T08:44:00.000Z	elkbuntu	Ries	did you look in apt/synaptic?
2006-03-07T08:45:00.000Z	Ries	elkbuntu	I simply did apt-cache search linux-image
2006-03-07T08:45:00.000Z	elkbuntu	Ries	use kernel as the search term, see what that brings up
2006-03-07T08:46:00.000Z	Ries	elkbuntu	LadyNikon: rebooting and going to take a look
2006-03-07T08:50:00.000Z	Ries	elkbuntu	LadyNikon: I just have a 2.6.12-9 kernel.... and with my network doesn't work.... I added a static entry in /etc/network/interfaces and run ifup eth0.... that works without a problem
2006-03-07T08:50:00.000Z	Ries	elkbuntu	LadyNikon: but when I try to ping my gateway (same network, netmask is good and my network address is good) then I get distination host unreacheable
2006-03-07T08:50:00.000Z	elkbuntu	Ries	make sure it's not listening on eth1 or something
2006-03-07T08:51:00.000Z	Ries	elkbuntu	then ifup eth0 would fail.....
2006-03-07T08:51:00.000Z	Ries	elkbuntu	I have done this many many times on Debian on several servers.....
2006-03-07T08:52:00.000Z	elkbuntu	Ries	then you know more about it than i. i was only suggesting ideas
2006-03-07T08:52:00.000Z	Ries	elkbuntu	normally con fiurating network is a snap for me.....
2006-03-07T08:52:00.000Z	elkbuntu	Ries	maybe a package reconfigure could help *shrugs*
2006-03-07T08:52:00.000Z	Ries	elkbuntu	well.. I din't know ubuntu..  and I just see a awefull lot of things are loaded I don't know of
2006-03-07T08:52:00.000Z	elkbuntu	Ries	i dont know what package that would be though
2006-03-07T08:53:00.000Z	elkbuntu	Ries	no, shrugs is where you shrug
2006-03-07T08:54:00.000Z	Ries	elkbuntu	I am lost.... maby I should ask my gf to shrug me?!?!
2006-03-07T08:54:00.000Z	elkbuntu	Ries	its where you raise your shoulders a bit as a gesture of not being sure...cant think how else to explain it
2006-03-07T08:55:00.000Z	Ries	elkbuntu	hehehe
2006-03-07T08:55:00.000Z	elkbuntu	Ries	understand?
2006-03-07T08:56:00.000Z	Ries	elkbuntu	I'll ask my GF :)
