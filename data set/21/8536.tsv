2006-05-17T06:59:00.000Z	gary		I'm having some big problems trying to install mplayer.  I get 3 dependency errors on: libfaad2-0, liblame0 and libxvidcore4.  All of which it says they are not installable.  Any ideas how I get around this?

2006-05-17T07:02:00.000Z	pvd2006		building mplayer from source is a lot better I think, it seems to work a lot better that way.
