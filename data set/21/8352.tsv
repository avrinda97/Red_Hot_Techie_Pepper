2006-07-28T08:54:00.000Z	klees	Warbo	I have a Radeon 9800 Pro
2006-07-28T08:51:00.000Z	Warbo	klees	With something like that then yes
2006-07-28T08:52:00.000Z	Warbo	klees	A TV capture device is needed, either a PCI one like my analog one, or some modern digital onesare USB
2006-07-28T08:52:00.000Z	Warbo	klees	Internet can be used for video podcasts and stuff, which is not quite TV, but similar
2006-07-28T08:52:00.000Z	klees	Warbo	so just the video card wont cut it huh?
2006-07-28T08:53:00.000Z	Warbo	klees	"video card" is sometimes a graphics card, and sometimes a TV card, depending on the context. I assume youare talking about a graphics card, then the answer is no
2006-07-28T08:54:00.000Z	Warbo	klees	What I mean is that the term "video card" has two meanings. A graphics card cannot usually pick up TV signals
2006-07-28T08:55:00.000Z	klees	Warbo	i was curious because i just bought a 20.1 in widescreen monitor
2006-07-28T08:56:00.000Z	Warbo	klees	eBay may help you. Do a bit of research before you buy anything though, since my PCTV card needs a lot of tweaking to stop the signal being black and white
2006-07-28T08:58:00.000Z	klees	Warbo	what do u connect to ur tv card?
2006-07-28T08:58:00.000Z	Warbo	klees	Composite for camcorder and regular terrestrial aerial for TV
2006-07-28T08:59:00.000Z	klees	Warbo	do u have to connect it to a TV?
2006-07-28T08:59:00.000Z	Warbo	klees	If I want TV signals then yes
2006-07-28T09:00:00.000Z	Warbo	klees	Oh, you mean the box? No
2006-07-28T09:00:00.000Z	Warbo	klees	The applications like Zpping or TVTime display it on the monitor
2006-07-28T09:01:00.000Z	Warbo	klees	The TV card is just input. The only thing I have that would connect to a TV is the TV-out on my graphics card
2006-08-03T08:50:00.000Z	Warbo	klees	Try dist-upgrade
2006-08-03T08:50:00.000Z	klees	Warbo	that also keeps it
2006-08-03T08:52:00.000Z	Warbo	klees	upgrade only upgrades your installed packages. dist-upgrade also removes or installs new/old ones
2006-08-03T08:52:00.000Z	klees	Warbo	k....  dist-ugrade still keeps Totem =\
2006-08-03T08:52:00.000Z	Warbo	klees	(so totem-gstreamer would need to install all of the newer gstreamer0.10 packages. upgrade wouldn't get them but dist-upgrade would)
