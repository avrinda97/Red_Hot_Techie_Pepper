2006-12-30T10:41:00.000Z	dignick		Hello everybody.  Quick question.  I'm considering building a network all-in-one device to be stashed away in a cold room to just do its job.  I'd like to use compact flash (ide to compact flash) as the system drive.  I've found a decent 2gb CF card at a reasonable price, so I need to know now if that much storage is enough.  Also, does anyone have any advice for/against using CF?
2006-12-30T10:41:00.000Z	ewook	dignick	I'm for it, as long as you don't swap on it :)
2006-12-30T10:43:00.000Z	dignick	ewook	why?
2006-12-30T10:45:00.000Z	ewook	dignick	a flashcard isn't really fast/ or capable of shifting around
2006-12-30T10:45:00.000Z	ewook	dignick	so, plenty of memory, and then a flashcard :)
2006-12-30T10:47:00.000Z	dignick	ewook	plenty...I was considering 512...enough?
2006-12-30T10:47:00.000Z	ewook	dignick	what are you gonna run on it?
2006-12-30T10:48:00.000Z	dignick	ewook	not much...used as file server, azureus maybe web hosting at some point
2006-12-30T10:48:00.000Z	ewook	dignick	well, ya, should be sufficient with 512 :)
2006-12-30T10:49:00.000Z	ewook	dignick	watch out for torrentflux or something else torrentrelated with python...
2006-12-30T10:49:00.000Z	ewook	dignick	that will eat your memory right up :=
2006-12-30T10:54:00.000Z	dignick	ewook	or anyone else: Using this machine as a gateway and firewall, any advice?  I've come across firestarter before...
2006-12-30T10:55:00.000Z	ewook	dignick	ya, sound like a good idea, but then I would drop the idea with fileserver.
2006-12-30T10:56:00.000Z	ewook	dignick	just a personal belief there. but, regarding router/gateway funtionallity, I'd recommend ipcop (a distro)
2006-12-30T10:58:00.000Z	dignick	ewook	I've looked at ipcop.  It just seemed a bit beyond me...I am pretty new to linux but this idea has got me excited, I just hope the whole thing isn't beyond me!
2006-12-30T10:59:00.000Z	ewook	dignick	oh, belive me - it isn't :)
2006-12-30T11:02:00.000Z	ewook	dignick	I don't think ipcop is beyond anyone.
2006-12-30T11:04:00.000Z	dignick	ewook	lol, ok.  Does it have decent hardware support out the box?  And how difficult would it be to get something like azureus running on it?  I would like this thing to be as all-in-one as possible, mounted on a wall next to my network switch :)
2006-12-30T11:05:00.000Z	ewook	dignick	oh... right... then I must say that it might become troublesome. getting azureus could prove a bit tricky (still duable tho)
2006-12-30T11:06:00.000Z	ewook	dignick	then, your first suggestion should be a bit nicer.
2006-12-30T11:07:00.000Z	dignick	ewook	ok, this is the thought process I have been through :) I'll persue this further on my own, and thanks for your help!
