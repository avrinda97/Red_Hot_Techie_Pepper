2009-10-30T21:01:00.000Z	wsch	soapy_illusions	#hardware is probably a good place for that unless its a software problem
2009-10-30T21:01:00.000Z	wsch	soapy_illusions	lol it was a joke, fans are also people that are a fan of you
2009-10-30T21:01:00.000Z	wsch		not only the rotating things
2009-10-30T21:02:00.000Z	soapy_illusions	wsch	well i have a bug report out but very few answers, and lol too early in the morning to keep up
2009-10-30T21:02:00.000Z	wsch	soapy_illusions	ah its a software problem? with ubuntu controlling the fans or something?
2009-10-30T21:02:00.000Z	soapy_illusions		ya and lm_sensors cannot detect my fan speed
2009-10-30T21:02:00.000Z	soapy_illusions		so i cant control it with that
2009-10-30T21:03:00.000Z	wsch	soapy_illusions	ah then this is definitely the good channel if you use ubuntu :p

2009-10-30T21:04:00.000Z	wsch	soapy_illusions	make sure they understand its ubuntu controlling the fans thats the problem, if you ask about it
