2005-10-11T15:42:00.000Z	tuxedo_kamen		ok, i'll explain it... I need to install javadoc, and my javac isn't working very good (when I compile it at home, I get errors that I don't get in my university's computer!), what should I do about those 2 things?
2005-10-11T15:43:00.000Z	Dark-Druid	tuxedo_kamen	what version of java are you using at home and what version does the university use?
2005-10-11T15:44:00.000Z	tuxedo_kamen	Dark-Druid	can I PM you?
2005-10-11T15:45:00.000Z	Dark-Druid	tuxedo_kamen	yeah
2005-10-11T15:53:00.000Z	Dark-Druid	tuxedo_kamen	javac -showversion
2005-10-11T15:54:00.000Z	Dark-Druid	tuxedo_kamen	javac -showversion
2005-10-11T15:55:00.000Z	tuxedo_kamen	Dark-Druid	they say it is an invalid flag!
2005-10-11T15:55:00.000Z	Dark-Druid	tuxedo_kamen	try java -showversion
2005-10-11T15:57:00.000Z	Dark-Druid	tuxedo_kamen	for javadoc as far as i can remeber you only need to install ant
2005-10-11T15:57:00.000Z	tuxedo_kamen	Dark-Druid	ok, my university has version 1-4-1-b21, I have 1.1.x-cvs from kaffe, how can I install theirs? :|
2005-10-11T15:59:00.000Z	Dark-Druid	tuxedo_kamen	i'm not sure how you ended up with that java version but to install 1.4 try sudo apt-get install j2sdk1.4
2005-10-12T16:01:00.000Z	tuxedo_kamen	Dark-Druid	I get this error: E: Impossvel encontrar o pacote j2sdk1.4
2005-10-12T16:03:00.000Z	Dark-Druid	tuxedo_kamen	sorry i guess i can't really offer any more help on the subject as i am pretty new to ubuntu and not totally sure what versions of java each release has or at what repositories carry what java packages..
2005-10-12T16:06:00.000Z	Dark-Druid	tuxedo_kamen	depends on your connection :P
2005-10-12T16:20:00.000Z	Dark-Druid	tuxedo_kamen	you could maybe try downloading java from sun's website
2005-10-12T16:24:00.000Z	Dark-Druid	tuxedo_kamen	to get javadoc you need ant...
2005-10-12T16:30:00.000Z	Dark-Druid	tuxedo_kamen	sorry forgot to answer...
2005-10-12T16:30:00.000Z	Dark-Druid	tuxedo_kamen	its there.... you use ant javadoc to generate javadoc documentation
2005-10-12T16:31:00.000Z	Dark-Druid	tuxedo_kamen	that is the ant build file i just mentioned
2005-10-12T16:33:00.000Z	Dark-Druid	tuxedo_kamen	not sure :P ... you could try and find some ant tutorials off google or something :P
2005-10-12T16:34:00.000Z	Dark-Druid	tuxedo_kamen	apparently i can't pm cause i am not registered
