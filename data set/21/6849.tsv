2007-01-18T16:36:00.000Z	pip		whats the name of the harddrive formater in ubuntu?
2007-01-18T16:37:00.000Z	pip		the name thats like the old dos one
2007-01-18T16:38:00.000Z	Pommie	pip	mkdos for formatting it
2007-01-18T16:38:00.000Z	Pommie	pip	sudo fdisk /dev/hd__
2007-01-18T16:38:00.000Z	pip	Pommie	 thanks :)
2007-01-18T16:44:00.000Z	Pommie	pip	Here's the limitations on partitions...
2007-01-18T16:44:00.000Z	Pommie	pip	You can have up to four (4) primary partitions
2007-01-18T16:44:00.000Z	Pommie	pip	But you can have numerous logical partitions in an extended partition.
2007-01-18T16:45:00.000Z	pip	Pommie	ok thanks. but is fdisk the easiest way to partition a fat32 drive?
2007-01-18T16:45:00.000Z	Pommie	pip	Depends on your experience level. ;)
2007-01-18T16:45:00.000Z	pip	Pommie	i used some kind of fdisk with black background and that was much easier. know which i mean?
2007-01-18T16:46:00.000Z	Pommie	pip	I use fdisk, but generally there are more graphical ways that can help beginners.
2007-01-18T16:48:00.000Z	Pommie	pip	It only partitions, it doesn't set up the partitions to be mounted for you.
2007-01-18T16:52:00.000Z	pip	Pommie	fokuslee: after ive written "sudo mount /dev/hdd1 /home/ubuntu/120gb -t vfat -o iocharset=utf8,umask=000" i still cant write to it?
2007-01-18T16:54:00.000Z	Pommie	pip	After "umask=000" add ",rw"
2007-01-18T16:57:00.000Z	Pommie	pip	After that "rw" option, add ",user"
2007-01-18T17:00:00.000Z	pip	Pommie	i love you too. thanks guys :)
2007-01-18T17:00:00.000Z	Pommie	pip	Awwww, I can just feel the love
