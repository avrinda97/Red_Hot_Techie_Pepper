2012-09-20T20:51:00.000Z	truexfan81	PatrickC	i switched from mint13 to 12.04 minimal, it feels like i got a cpu upgrade lol

2012-09-20T20:55:00.000Z	PatrickC	truexfan81	i'm on an android ROM team
2012-09-20T20:56:00.000Z	truexfan81	PatrickC	i'm sure you probably could install a de, but you would have probably have to install xorg as its likely not installed
2012-09-20T20:59:00.000Z	truexfan81	PatrickC	the minimal iso is a netinstall thats why its so small
2012-09-20T20:59:00.000Z	PatrickC	truexfan81	gotcha
2012-09-20T21:00:00.000Z	PatrickC	truexfan81	yep
2012-09-20T21:10:00.000Z	truexfan81	PatrickC	if you take my route and not install a de, i found the easiest way to install xorg
2012-09-20T21:11:00.000Z	PatrickC	truexfan81	when you say "DE" what do you mean?
2012-09-20T21:17:00.000Z	truexfan81	PatrickC	mate, cinnamon are sadly not options in the installer
2012-09-20T21:18:00.000Z	PatrickC	truexfan81	that's fine.. i can install it from cmd line
2012-09-20T21:19:00.000Z	truexfan81	PatrickC	one sec i'll look in my logs and see what the package was, it was python-something
2012-09-20T21:21:00.000Z	truexfan81	PatrickC	to install mate from cli you will first need to install python-software-properties
2012-09-20T21:22:00.000Z	truexfan81	PatrickC	did you like gnome2?
2012-09-20T21:22:00.000Z	PatrickC	truexfan81	no kidding...
2012-09-20T21:23:00.000Z	truexfan81	PatrickC	when gnome dropped gnome2 mate project picked it up
2012-09-20T21:24:00.000Z	truexfan81	PatrickC	in mate nautilus is now Caja, gedit is now pluma
2012-09-20T21:24:00.000Z	truexfan81	PatrickC	lets move over to the offtopic channel as they ask
