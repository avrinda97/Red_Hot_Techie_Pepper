2007-08-08T05:25:00.000Z	dgeorge		how do i install a bin file
2007-08-08T05:25:00.000Z	javaJake	dgeorge	if you get Totem firefox plugins, and then install all the codecs available, Real stuff should play.
2007-08-08T05:25:00.000Z	javaJake	dgeorge	run it in a terminal.
2007-08-08T05:26:00.000Z	javaJake	dgeorge	first you have to run chmod u+x <path-to-bin> on it
2007-08-08T05:50:00.000Z	javaJake	dgeorge	there's no better way to learn a new OS then to spend time playing with it./
2007-08-08T05:50:00.000Z	javaJake	dgeorge	once you run into a problem, look up the solution to solve it.
2007-08-08T05:50:00.000Z	javaJake	dgeorge	using Google, of course.
2007-08-08T05:50:00.000Z	javaJake	dgeorge	asking someone else is good, but then you don't know why or how it works.
2007-08-08T05:51:00.000Z	javaJake	dgeorge	the only reason I know Linux is because I researched and solved most problems that came up
2007-08-08T05:55:00.000Z	javaJake	dgeorge	if any app doesn't open, always run it in the terminal. 99% of the time it prints out an error there you can Google or otherwise look into
2007-08-08T05:56:00.000Z	javaJake	dgeorge	isn't it!?
2007-08-08T05:56:00.000Z	javaJake	dgeorge	so, you know what to do next?
2007-08-08T05:57:00.000Z	javaJake	dgeorge	right, so, what installs software?
2007-08-08T05:59:00.000Z	javaJake	dgeorge	whatcha mean?
2007-08-08T06:01:00.000Z	javaJake	dgeorge	did you read those instructions?
2007-08-08T06:01:00.000Z	javaJake	dgeorge	did you get the message from uboty?
2007-08-08T06:06:00.000Z	javaJake	dgeorge	correct
2007-08-08T06:06:00.000Z	javaJake	dgeorge	if you want to use a "mouse" way instead, goto System -> Administration -> Synaptic Package Manager
