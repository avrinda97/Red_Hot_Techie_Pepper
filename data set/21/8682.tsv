2006-06-16T06:00:00.000Z	Draconicus	nekostar	Nothing is muted. I know how to work with alsamixer. A ! in front of each mp3 and "unable to play file" does not mean that it's muted.
2006-06-16T06:04:00.000Z	nekostar	Draconicus	breezy is not the same as dapper with sound for some reason

2006-06-16T06:07:00.000Z	Draconicus	nekostar	I'm not a linux newbie. h3sp4wn actually recognized that and suggested something other than the obvious stuff. Try that next time.
2006-06-16T06:07:00.000Z	nekostar	Draconicus	try redhat next time
2006-06-16T06:07:00.000Z	Draconicus	nekostar	Quiet, you, or I'll go back to Gentoo.

2006-06-16T06:09:00.000Z	nekostar	Draconicus	what do you call it when you run a file ?
2006-06-16T06:09:00.000Z	Draconicus	nekostar	You don't run an mp3. You read it.
