2011-03-26T19:20:00.000Z	truepurple		This PC has one drive that is 333mb big, the main drive, and about 800 on the other partition or drive
2011-03-26T19:20:00.000Z	truepurple		This is someone elses PC
2011-03-26T19:21:00.000Z	truepurple		Both PCs have CD drives, but THIS pc has no burning capacity
2011-03-26T19:21:00.000Z	truepurple		If I had one, I would
2011-03-26T19:21:00.000Z	truepurple		No, that is the point
2011-03-26T19:21:00.000Z	truepurple		Its just assembled parts I purchased, till I get a OS or two
2011-03-26T19:22:00.000Z	truepurple		hyper, so funny, it isn't
2011-03-26T19:23:00.000Z	truepurple		Anyway, that is the point of netinstall
2011-03-26T19:23:00.000Z	truepurple		So back to the topic, why can't I make partitions AFTER installing ubuntu?
2011-03-26T19:24:00.000Z	truepurple		Including swap partition?
2011-03-26T19:24:00.000Z	alsuna	truepurple	why not create partitions during install?
2011-07-21T23:56:00.000Z	alsuna	truepurple	allow the system to execute the code within the file
2011-07-21T23:57:00.000Z	truepurple	alsuna	but what does "(+x)" mean?
2011-07-21T23:58:00.000Z	truepurple	alsuna	And this is done in properties, permissions, right?
2011-07-21T23:59:00.000Z	alsuna	truepurple	nope, this is done on the commandline
2011-07-22T00:00:00.000Z	truepurple	alsuna	So what is the make executable in properties > permissions about then? Is that something separate?
2011-07-22T00:01:00.000Z	alsuna	truepurple	i believe that is the same.
2011-07-22T00:02:00.000Z	truepurple	alsuna	So what is the command way to make a file executable?
2011-07-22T00:02:00.000Z	alsuna	truepurple	going through the gui as you just described does the same. On the commandline you type chmod +x file
2011-07-22T00:05:00.000Z	alsuna	truepurple	yes, just give it the full path of the file
2011-07-22T00:06:00.000Z	alsuna	truepurple	like chomd +x full/path/to/the/file
