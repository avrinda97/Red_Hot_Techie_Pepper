2011-09-26T09:10:00.000Z	EvilGenius101		I cannot seem to install ubuntu on my laptop. Its overheating it and casusing a thermal shutdown
2011-09-26T09:11:00.000Z	EvilGenius101		its a new i3 laptop, windows works fine. even heavy operations. tried USB/CD install but it gets stuck at a  Preloader screen when i press install
2011-09-26T09:12:00.000Z	EvilGenius101		jroy, I can run windows 7 fine, Visual Studio 2010 fine, Game fine. But one damn linux won't install
2011-09-26T09:13:00.000Z	EvilGenius101		I don't have 10.04 iso. Guess will have to get it.
2011-09-26T09:13:00.000Z	EvilGenius101		Is there any way to install it in from windows? I've got a spare drive
2011-09-26T09:13:00.000Z	EvilGenius101		but the window install doesn't give me an option. it just says Demo & Install
2011-09-26T09:14:00.000Z	alkafoo	EvilGenius101	a spare drive?
2011-09-26T09:14:00.000Z	EvilGenius101	alkafoo	I mean partition.
2011-09-26T09:14:00.000Z	alkafoo	EvilGenius101	right, it installs to a file on the Windows partition
2011-09-26T09:15:00.000Z	alkafoo	EvilGenius101	you can migrate that to its own real partition later, but it's kind of the long way around
2011-09-26T09:15:00.000Z	alkafoo	EvilGenius101	you don't have a CD/DVD/USB stick?
2011-09-26T09:15:00.000Z	alkafoo	EvilGenius101	all set then
2011-09-26T09:16:00.000Z	EvilGenius101	alkafoo	CD or USB it gets stuck on Preloader screen with ubuntu logo. on reboot the bios moans OVERHEATED
2011-09-26T09:18:00.000Z	alkafoo	EvilGenius101	sweet
2011-09-26T09:18:00.000Z	alkafoo	EvilGenius101	but your Windows install works fine?
2011-09-26T09:19:00.000Z	alkafoo	EvilGenius101	did you try a different version?
2011-09-26T09:19:00.000Z	EvilGenius101	alkafoo	don't have another iso right now. Will download something later then
2011-09-26T09:21:00.000Z	alkafoo	EvilGenius101	could be some weird option you could toggle in your BIOS, too
2011-09-26T09:22:00.000Z	EvilGenius101	alkafoo	I doubt it. Its very basic BIOS for the laptop. Nothing I think stands out. it won't even run as live cd
2011-09-26T09:23:00.000Z	alkafoo	EvilGenius101	has a live cd ever worked with it?
2011-09-26T09:26:00.000Z	alkafoo	EvilGenius101	technically you can copy your vmware install to empty partition space, but you'd have to possibly tweak the drivers instead of them being autoconfigured
