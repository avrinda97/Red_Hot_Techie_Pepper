2005-02-08T17:24:00.000Z	cafuego		Anyone know offhand if the Hoary Xorg has evdev support?
2005-02-08T10:26:00.000Z	cafuego		What option?
2005-02-08T10:26:00.000Z	cafuego		"This hardware is not supported by Linux. Go to this website and pay for a driver. [link] "
2005-02-08T10:27:00.000Z	cafuego		Actually, 2 weeks before it's ready seems to be the norm these days.
2005-02-08T10:28:00.000Z	cafuego		Maybe Ubuntu should stick with Gnome 2.8 until things don't magically stop working after an evolution update.
2005-02-08T10:28:00.000Z	jdub	cafuego	we track the devel branch so these things are found and fixed
2005-02-08T10:28:00.000Z	jdub	cafuego	otherwise we'd never be able to release with the latest gnome
2005-02-08T10:29:00.000Z	jdub	cafuego	when ubuntu is released, gnome is stable
2005-02-08T10:29:00.000Z	cafuego	jdub	Does that mean Ubuntu won't ever be released? ;-)
2005-02-08T10:29:00.000Z	jdub	cafuego	we release the preview on the day of gnome's release, then we stabilise an extra month and then do the final ubuntu release
2005-02-08T10:30:00.000Z	jdub	cafuego	ubuntu is released every six months, on the day. same as gnome.
2005-02-08T10:30:00.000Z	cafuego	jdub	Grrhm.
2005-02-10T07:03:00.000Z	cafuego	jdub	it's be pretty easy to trace the image in fontographer and have a partial font file.
2005-02-10T07:03:00.000Z	jdub	cafuego	sure, but that's not as useful as having an actual corporate face.
2005-02-10T07:04:00.000Z	cafuego	jdub	Well, from the letters we have, it'd not be hard to create a full set of 26 (plus ?!.-)
2005-02-10T07:09:00.000Z	jdub	cafuego	making a good typeface is extraordinarily hard.
2005-02-10T07:10:00.000Z	cafuego	jdub	Yeah. it's not hard to make a simple one for scaling on logos &c though.
2005-02-10T07:12:00.000Z	jdub	cafuego	we have the logo and device in vector formats
2005-02-10T07:13:00.000Z	cafuego	jdub	That makes creating a TTF even easier ;-)
2005-02-10T10:33:00.000Z	cafuego	jdub	I have the 'n' and 'u' done ;-)
2005-02-10T10:33:00.000Z	jdub	cafuego	heh
