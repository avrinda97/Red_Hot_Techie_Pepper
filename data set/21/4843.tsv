2008-02-18T06:03:00.000Z	peleg		anyone knows about an option to add to nautilus fields of permissions etc. ?
2008-02-18T06:03:00.000Z	Flannel	peleg	what?
2008-02-18T06:04:00.000Z	peleg	Flannel	I want to see things like permissions in the list of files in nautilus.
2009-07-09T12:51:00.000Z	Flannel	peleg	If you need to install a package before you upgrade, use http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/
2009-07-09T12:52:00.000Z	peleg	Flannel	thanks
2009-07-09T12:52:00.000Z	Flannel	peleg	but again, you really ought to upgrade to 8.04 (and then might as well stick on LTS, since it seems to suit you)
2009-07-09T12:56:00.000Z	peleg	Flannel	after changing to old-releases, I don't have the pdftk package any more...
2009-07-09T12:57:00.000Z	Flannel	peleg	It should be an exact copy of the last state of the 7.10 mirrors
2009-07-09T12:58:00.000Z	peleg	Flannel	well, I did have pdftk before...
2010-02-19T13:44:00.000Z	Flannel	peleg	Change that from old-releases to releases
2010-02-19T13:45:00.000Z	peleg	Flannel	I'll try that, thanks
2010-06-16T11:18:00.000Z	Flannel	peleg	texlive-pstricks has pst-calendar, if that'll work for you.  But yes, sty files can be used by simply placing them in your working directory
2010-06-16T11:19:00.000Z	peleg	Flannel	yes, but packages should help me not doing that :) -- besides, why would one REMOVE them from a package, when they were already there?
2010-06-16T11:19:00.000Z	Flannel	peleg	Were they?  Let me look.
2010-06-16T11:20:00.000Z	peleg	Flannel	http://packages.ubuntu.com/de/intrepid/texlive-latex-extra -> http://packages.ubuntu.com/de/lucid/texlive-latex-extra
2010-06-16T11:22:00.000Z	Flannel	peleg	I'm looking at the changelog (http://changelogs.ubuntu.com/changelogs/pool/main/t/texlive-extra/texlive-extra_2009-7ubuntu3/changelog), (from 2007.dfsg.3-2 to present), and I can't see any notes about dropping those.
2010-06-16T11:23:00.000Z	Flannel	peleg	It might be an oversight, have you considered filing a bug?
2010-06-16T11:24:00.000Z	peleg	Flannel	sure, why not. Never done this before, though. Any tips before I'm starting?
2010-06-16T11:24:00.000Z	Flannel	peleg	ubottu just sent you a paragraph, the ReportingBugs page has some good info
2010-06-16T11:25:00.000Z	peleg	Flannel	thanks
2010-06-16T11:25:00.000Z	Flannel	peleg	and if you have questions, feel free to ask the channel
