2008-12-19T22:55:00.000Z	ikonia	edmoore	you can install it post install fine
2008-12-19T22:55:00.000Z	edmoore	ikonia	likewise raid0?
2008-12-19T22:55:00.000Z	ikonia	edmoore	yup
2008-12-19T22:55:00.000Z	ikonia	edmoore	however raid0 can't be used as a boot partition and is also suicide
2008-12-19T22:56:00.000Z	ikonia	edmoore	because the slightest inconsistancy with any of the desks and your file system is dead
2008-12-19T22:56:00.000Z	edmoore	ikonia	recommendations instead?
2008-12-19T22:57:00.000Z	ikonia	edmoore	buy a big disk,
2008-12-19T22:57:00.000Z	ikonia	edmoore	use multiple partitions on small disks
2008-12-19T22:57:00.000Z	ikonia	edmoore	use lvm without raid
2008-12-19T22:58:00.000Z	ikonia	edmoore	you don't trust a single disk, but you trust raid 0 ?/?
2008-12-19T22:58:00.000Z	ikonia	edmoore	why not use raid 1 mirroring ?
2008-12-19T22:59:00.000Z	ikonia	edmoore	then you have redudant disks if your disks are important to you
2008-12-19T22:59:00.000Z	edmoore	ikonia	ok, raid1 it is
2008-12-19T22:59:00.000Z	edmoore	ikonia	can I set up raid1 mirroring after a standard desktop install?
2008-12-19T22:59:00.000Z	ikonia	edmoore	not at install time, but you can certainly do it post install
2008-12-19T22:59:00.000Z	ikonia	edmoore	software raid one (linux, not fake raid) is a very good option
2008-12-19T23:01:00.000Z	ikonia	edmoore	install how you want to on disk one, then we'll worry about setting up your mirroring
2009-10-14T14:48:00.000Z	ikonia	edmoore	disable X
2009-10-14T14:48:00.000Z	ikonia	edmoore	but that means you'll have to manually startX everytime you want an X11 application
2009-10-14T14:48:00.000Z	edmoore	ikonia	I know it's something vaguely to do with that but I'm not sure specifically how one does it?
2009-10-14T14:49:00.000Z	ikonia	edmoore	look in your /etc/init.d scrpts at the gdm script, then look at this url
