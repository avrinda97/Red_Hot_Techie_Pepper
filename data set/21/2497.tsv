2009-09-21T08:35:00.000Z	kapil	mike45094	you can certainly have 1 screen session with different activities in each screen window.
2009-09-21T08:35:00.000Z	mike45094	kapil	could you explain to me how to do this
2009-09-21T08:37:00.000Z	kapil		start screen with "screen". You will get a command prompt (after the splash message). there you type something like "screen vi first_file.txt". This will open first_file.txt in a new screen window and so on. you switch between screen windows with "Ctrl+a"
2009-09-21T08:37:00.000Z	kapil		see "info screen" for the documentation (or "man screen"). Also remember "Ctrl-a ?" for help.
2009-09-21T08:38:00.000Z	mike45094		cool
2009-09-21T08:38:00.000Z	mike45094	kapil	I'm going to give this a shot, actually the reason I asked this is because I used to use Ctyl-a a lot
2009-09-21T08:38:00.000Z	mike45094		like a year ago
2009-09-21T08:38:00.000Z	mike45094		and I forgot how to go about doing this methodology etc
2009-09-21T08:39:00.000Z	kapil	mike45094	you can define the command key to be something other than Ctrl-a.
2009-09-21T08:40:00.000Z	mike45094		how do you name a session?
2009-09-21T08:40:00.000Z	mike45094		I thought you could name a screen session with -S ?
2009-09-21T08:40:00.000Z	mike45094		not child sessions though?
2009-09-21T08:41:00.000Z	mike45094		for example I want to do `screen vi README.txt` and have the session be called either... ReadMe.txt or TXT while I'm flipping through my screen sessions
2009-09-21T08:41:00.000Z	kapil	mike45094	you can name screen windows with "Ctrl-a A"
2009-09-21T08:42:00.000Z	mike45094		that seems like a bit much
2009-09-21T08:42:00.000Z	mike45094		is there any other way to do that like on execute
2009-09-21T08:42:00.000Z	mike45094		I would like to write a script, that's why I'm asking
2009-09-21T08:44:00.000Z	kapil		or you can invoke new commands on the screen command line (C-a :). there you can give a command like "screen -t Readme.txt vi README.txt".
2009-09-21T08:44:00.000Z	mike45094		-t eh?
2009-09-21T08:45:00.000Z	kapil		screen -t test sh
2009-09-21T08:45:00.000Z	kapil	mike45094	the above seems to work in my current screen session.
