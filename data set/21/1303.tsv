2011-03-08T21:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	anadon	 dirty work around would be to add your own entry for your win7 in /etc/grub.d/41_custom
2011-03-08T21:28:00.000Z	anadon	Dr_Willis	don't know how
2011-03-08T21:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	anadon	 forums or grub docs may show an example entry for win7 that can work. or take one from someones grub.cfg that has it.
2011-03-08T21:30:00.000Z	anadon	Dr_Willis	where??
2011-03-08T21:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	anadon	 heres a paste of my grub.cfg - lines 69-77  (or ther eabout) are the entry to boot windows for me.
2011-03-08T22:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	anadon	 seems to be a common issue today.
2011-03-08T22:53:00.000Z	anadon	Dr_Willis	same guy(me) each time--no one's helped all the way through
2011-03-08T22:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	anadon	 thers been other nicks.. i gave you a pastebin of my grub.cfg earlier i think. You could of just cut/pasted and 3edited the right lines int o your /etc/grub.d/41_custom
2011-03-08T22:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	anadon	 and you did boot to ubuntu and reran 'sudo update-grub' ?

2011-03-08T22:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	anadon	 cut/paste the lines i mentioned into your /etc/grub.d/41_custom   and edit them to boot your windows install.

2011-03-08T23:02:00.000Z	anadon	Dr_Willis	I'm sorry for having to ask this, but what's the file location?
