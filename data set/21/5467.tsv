2010-04-06T05:55:00.000Z	Slyboots		The idea is to move the files.. and if the folders already exist just.. add them to the current folders
2010-04-06T05:56:00.000Z	Slyboots		Doesnt work
2010-04-06T05:56:00.000Z	Slyboots		slyboots@Beluga:/media/array/Videos/TV/Deadliest Warrior1$ sudo mv -f * ../Deadliest\ Warrior
2010-04-06T05:56:00.000Z	Slyboots		mv: cannot move `Season 1' to `../Deadliest Warrior/Season 1': Directory not empty
2010-04-06T05:57:00.000Z	Slyboots		Because the folder "Season 1" already exists in the target directory, apparnetly thats some huge crime and mv wont play ball
2010-04-06T05:57:00.000Z	Slyboots		Running the move as root
2010-04-06T05:57:00.000Z	Slyboots		(hense Sudo)
2010-04-06T05:59:00.000Z	Slyboots		So.. no-one any clue why I cant do the most *basic* file managment?
2010-04-06T06:00:00.000Z	Slyboots		I mean I dont mean to be rude but.. I dont understand how this doesnt come up all the time
2010-04-06T06:01:00.000Z	Slyboots		No clobber eh?
2010-04-06T06:02:00.000Z	geirha	Slyboots	rsync should handle it
2010-04-06T06:02:00.000Z	Slyboots	geirha	But thats copying..
2010-04-06T06:04:00.000Z	geirha	Slyboots	It has options to remove source files files and such
2010-04-06T06:06:00.000Z	Slyboots	geirha	Plus I dont think rsync will delete folders.. only files
2010-04-06T06:08:00.000Z	geirha	Slyboots	You are moving directories, that's different from regular files.
2010-04-06T06:10:00.000Z	geirha	Slyboots	You mean coreutils handles badly, linux is not the issue
2010-04-06T06:13:00.000Z	geirha	Slyboots	rsync + rmdir
2010-04-06T06:13:00.000Z	Slyboots	geirha	Adn if rsync fails or some reason it deletes my files :P
2010-04-06T06:13:00.000Z	geirha	Slyboots	No.
2010-04-06T06:14:00.000Z	geirha	Slyboots	rsync only deletes upon successful copy, and rmdir only deletes empty directories.
2010-06-15T15:20:00.000Z	geirha	Slyboots	It's likely in a separate file under /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
