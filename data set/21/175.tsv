2012-06-30T13:27:00.000Z	ghostchick2013		as i said i kinda thing where the pb lays
2012-06-30T13:27:00.000Z	altan	ghostchick2013	no, there is no prompt for booting from windows
2012-06-30T13:27:00.000Z	altan	ghostchick2013	i installed windows after ubuntu
2012-06-30T13:28:00.000Z	ghostchick2013	altan	run sudo update-grub and tell me what appears
2012-06-30T13:28:00.000Z	altan	ghostchick2013	i already repaired grub
2012-06-30T13:28:00.000Z	altan	ghostchick2013	it generated a grub.cfg
2012-06-30T13:29:00.000Z	altan	ghostchick2013	Found Windows 8 (loader) on /dev/sda2
2012-06-30T13:30:00.000Z	altan	ghostchick2013	should i reboot?
2012-06-30T13:30:00.000Z	ghostchick2013	altan	 i also use w8 , from memory i have read that there is a pb of compatibility because of windows blocking linux
2012-06-30T13:30:00.000Z	ghostchick2013	altan	 reboot at least we will be fixed
2012-06-30T13:36:00.000Z	altan	ghostchick2013	I was able to boot into windows 8 from the grub menu
2012-06-30T13:36:00.000Z	altan	ghostchick2013	how can i get the grub menu to show by default?
2012-06-30T13:37:00.000Z	ghostchick2013	altan	 cool taking notes  for   my own windows 8  , planning to get some android and ubuntu on it
2012-06-30T13:37:00.000Z	altan	ghostchick2013	my primary os was ubuntu, i installed windows 8 afterwards
2012-06-30T13:37:00.000Z	ghostchick2013	altan	 you mean to pick and boot in  w8 by default?
2012-06-30T13:38:00.000Z	altan	ghostchick2013	no, to have the grub show up on its own w/o holding shift
2012-06-30T13:38:00.000Z	altan	ghostchick2013	it was like that at one point while i was on 12.10, i just dont know how it happened
2012-06-30T13:38:00.000Z	ghostchick2013	altan	 google some grub configurators , grub2 editing is messy imo
2012-06-30T13:39:00.000Z	altan	ghostchick2013	alright. thanks for the help!
2012-06-30T13:41:00.000Z	ghostchick2013	altan	 no pb and good luck
