2007-06-17T11:46:00.000Z	Nutubuntu		I don't understand why I cannot write the Feisty alternate install iso to a 700MB cd, but it consistently fails. Checksum is okay for the iso file..
2007-06-17T11:46:00.000Z	wols_	Nutubuntu	how does it fail? errmro messages aren't just for show
2007-06-17T11:47:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	wols_	I have pastebinned the entire thing at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/25994/ thank you for asking about that :)
2007-06-17T11:55:00.000Z	wols_	Nutubuntu	you still haven't told us the error
2007-06-17T11:56:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	wols_	I don't want to flood the channel; I have pastebinned the error at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/25994/  (as I mentioned before)
2007-06-17T11:57:00.000Z	wols_	Nutubuntu	does it always stop at the same place  "656 of  696MB written" ?
2007-06-17T11:59:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	wols_	 so far yes, it stops at same place; I suspect the CDs are junk
2007-06-17T12:07:00.000Z	wols_	Nutubuntu	I asked you a question. I won't answer until you answer my questions too
2007-06-17T12:08:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	wols_	 I answered your question, but I think maybe you missed it amidst all the rest of the things you were doing: Yes, it makes the same error at 656 MB each time.
2007-06-17T12:09:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	wols_	 mikeyhatesms != Nutubuntu  ;)
2007-06-17T12:10:00.000Z	wols_	Nutubuntu	he is not the only one who demands help but is not able to answer simple questions. lots of those here
2007-06-17T12:10:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	wols_	 n/p and thanks again
2007-06-17T12:10:00.000Z	wols_	Nutubuntu	danny s right. record as image! that's important
2007-06-17T12:11:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	wols_	 danny, have been doing that, I promise ;) -- "True, I was born at night, but not LAST night"
2007-06-17T12:12:00.000Z	wols_	Nutubuntu	:)
2007-06-20T07:33:00.000Z	wols_	Nutubuntu	yes
2007-06-20T07:35:00.000Z	wols_	Nutubuntu	if you want them exactly anyways why do you want to install them not at once? what you do is usually done to not install all the "cruft", ie to get a lean system
2007-06-20T07:36:00.000Z	wols_	Nutubuntu	in which case you don't want to install it just install what you actually need
2007-06-20T07:36:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	wols_	I probably would like a leaner installation, so maybe it's good, but the reason I am not just letting the installation routine install them, is that it's breaking at that point. I don't know why yet.
2007-06-20T07:37:00.000Z	wols_	Nutubuntu	e..g the gui you get via aptitude install x-window-syste ubuntu-dektop
