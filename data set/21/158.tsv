2012-07-20T07:35:00.000Z	NMachado	S4H4N_	 this will work, it's a bit large but that'll do
2012-07-20T07:37:00.000Z	NMachado	S4H4N_	bobweaver's right download that from that link or do the command l3top gave you asthe one i gave you before was wrong, sorry about that

2012-07-20T07:44:00.000Z	NMachado	S4H4N_	 or download that .deb file and you'regood to go!
2012-07-20T07:45:00.000Z	NMachado	S4H4N_	 the .deb file of playonlinux that bobweaver mentioned also
2012-07-20T07:46:00.000Z	NMachado	S4H4N_	 that will do thesame of wine because it's just a graphical frontend for it
2012-07-20T07:47:00.000Z	NMachado	S4H4N_	 somethings can just be uncomplicated if we want to :)
2012-07-20T07:51:00.000Z	NMachado	S4H4N_	 sorry but i really need to go now,you can ask for other ways to do that, i just gave you my opinion and help, because i did the same once, because i had a problem similar to yours.
