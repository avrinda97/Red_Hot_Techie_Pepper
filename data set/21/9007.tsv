2006-03-27T07:31:00.000Z	elkbuntu	C-O-L-T	you are aware of 'yum' though, right?
2006-03-27T07:32:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	elkbuntu	I have never used fedora and I don't know how to use yum. Anyway my first linux distro is ubuntu. so I am new in linux. Just I am interested in fedora
2006-03-27T07:33:00.000Z	elkbuntu	C-O-L-T	well, fedora has man pages too, so try 'man yum'
2006-03-27T07:34:00.000Z	elkbuntu	C-O-L-T	the full distro with much of the stuff included in the yum repos is 4 cds yes
2006-03-27T07:35:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	elkbuntu	there is not a thing like in ubuntu. You install 1 cd but you get just the useful everyday tools in ti
2006-03-27T07:35:00.000Z	elkbuntu	C-O-L-T	you do get the useful stuff with the other many-cd distros too, just the other cds are provided to save having to download them as you go
2006-03-27T07:36:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	elkbuntu	I see
2006-03-27T07:37:00.000Z	elkbuntu	C-O-L-T	he knows. fedora != ubuntu
2006-03-27T07:38:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	elkbuntu	I see :D
2006-03-27T07:39:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	elkbuntu	Can I install gnome 2.14 on breezy?
2006-03-27T07:40:00.000Z	elkbuntu	C-O-L-T	if you want to chance your luck with dapper... discussion for which is in #ubuntu+1
2006-03-27T07:41:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	elkbuntu	I have installed dapper but it always crashed. I wait till the final release
2006-03-27T07:42:00.000Z	elkbuntu	C-O-L-T	it is, yes
2006-03-27T07:42:00.000Z	elkbuntu	C-O-L-T	visit the tinyurl to understand
2006-03-27T07:43:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	elkbuntu	I have visited it. I wanted gnome 2.14 cause it is faster than 2.12/ Now???
2006-03-27T07:44:00.000Z	elkbuntu	C-O-L-T	you really should take this discussion to #ubuntu+1
2006-03-27T07:45:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	elkbuntu	ok. But practically in your op. Can I install gnome 2.14 on breezy?
2006-03-27T07:46:00.000Z	elkbuntu	C-O-L-T	i'm sure there is a way, but i dont know it
2006-03-27T07:47:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	elkbuntu	where to find it? I thought that upgrading to gnome 2.14 will be as easy as upgrading ubuntu
2006-03-27T07:47:00.000Z	elkbuntu	C-O-L-T	i dont know
2006-03-27T07:48:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	elkbuntu	I will ask on #gnome. Probably they know it
