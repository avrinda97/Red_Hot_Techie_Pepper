2007-04-01T12:43:00.000Z	cables	ALEX319	you can private chat on IRC too, but that's not what you need right now. Go to #winehq for help with Wine.

2007-04-01T12:45:00.000Z	cables	ALEX319	that'll let you private message people.

2007-04-01T12:47:00.000Z	cables	ALEX319	I'm not sure how to do it from PJIRC with clicking, but you can do /msg WHO-YOU-WANT-TO-CHAT-WITH MESSAGE and it should open up a new tab when they send a message back to you.
