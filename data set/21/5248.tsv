2010-07-11T13:40:00.000Z	szonek		where can i get ISO integrated with this fix: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/lucid/+source/grub-installer/+bug/568050 ?
2010-07-11T13:40:00.000Z	szonek		because i can't install Ubuntu on my fakeraid
2010-07-11T13:41:00.000Z	szonek		;-[
2010-07-11T13:42:00.000Z	szonek		lol
2010-07-11T13:43:00.000Z	szonek		sorry but you sound like funboys, both Windows and Ubuntu have cons and pros
2010-07-11T13:44:00.000Z	szonek		anyway.. is there something like 'daily iso' for Lucid?
2010-07-11T13:44:00.000Z	Cheery	szonek	well yeah.. though I pretty much ignore all the pros because it's closed source system which can throw out logs to my path whenever it wants to.
2010-07-11T13:44:00.000Z	Cheery	szonek	that's large enough cons that it negates any gains you would get by using windows.
2010-07-11T13:46:00.000Z	szonek	Cheery	not everyone need open source OS and not for everyone it's important thing
2010-07-11T13:48:00.000Z	Cheery	szonek	well, I think it's important for anyone who WANTS to keep using computers with reasonable expenses.
2010-07-11T13:48:00.000Z	Cheery	szonek	otherwise it isn't.
2010-07-11T13:48:00.000Z	Cheery	szonek	most people do not think open source is important, so.. you can do the math.
2010-07-11T13:54:00.000Z	szonek	Cheery	Open Source has long way to go to align with Windows software when it gets to system for normal user but it's getting there.
2010-07-11T13:55:00.000Z	Cheery	szonek	it's not.
2010-07-11T13:56:00.000Z	szonek	Cheery	as an example you can compare Outlook and Evolution - second one has loooooooooooooong way to go
2010-07-11T13:57:00.000Z	Cheery	szonek	does it? Evolution looks quite okay to me. :)
2010-07-11T13:57:00.000Z	szonek	Cheery	works like shit with Exchange
2010-07-11T13:57:00.000Z	Cheery	szonek	anyway, it doesn't even matter whether open source software is mature or not to be used.
2010-07-11T13:58:00.000Z	Cheery	szonek	just saying you won't have an inexpensive or well-functioning computing ecosystem without open source.
2010-07-11T13:59:00.000Z	Cheery	szonek	email systems are pretty mess. I still don't understand why nobody has just done a config script that sets up the email account info correct without user having to bother.
