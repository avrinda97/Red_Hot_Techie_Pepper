2008-05-01T05:58:00.000Z	richard		can anyone help me get my wireless card working again (it was working, now - not so much :( )
2008-05-01T06:00:00.000Z	bazhang	richard	what is your chipset (that card)
2008-05-01T06:00:00.000Z	richard	bazhang	cisco
2008-05-01T06:00:00.000Z	bazhang	richard	the aironet? you said now not so much--is it just not working at all or just degraded performance
2008-05-01T06:01:00.000Z	richard	bazhang	the aironet, yes.  and not working at all now - was working yesterday and i don't think(!) I changed anything
2008-05-01T06:02:00.000Z	bazhang	richard	was there an update/upgrade since now and then?
2008-05-01T06:02:00.000Z	richard	bazhang	it shows up in "Hardware Information", but not in "Network"
2008-05-01T06:03:00.000Z	richard	bazhang	hm. I definitely powercycled but i didn't update *just before* the power cycle, but possibly a day or two before
2008-05-01T06:04:00.000Z	bazhang	richard	is it wlan0? what does sudo ifup wlan0 do
2008-05-01T06:05:00.000Z	richard	bazhang	"Ignoring unknown intrface wlan0=wlan0"
2008-05-01T06:05:00.000Z	bazhang	richard	ifconfig does not show it?
2008-05-01T06:05:00.000Z	richard	bazhang	ifconfig -a doesn't list the wireless card
2008-05-01T06:06:00.000Z	bazhang	richard	that is very odd especially since it was working just earlier
2008-05-01T06:07:00.000Z	richard	bazhang	actually, lspci doesn't list it either (if it should?)
2008-05-01T06:07:00.000Z	bazhang	richard	what about lsusb
2008-05-01T06:07:00.000Z	richard	bazhang	but it *does* appear in System->Preferences->Hardware Information
2008-05-01T06:13:00.000Z	richard	bazhang	wow - that's odd.  I unplugged/replugged it back in and now i see *two* wireless interfaces (wifi0 and eth1) - is that normal?
2008-05-01T06:13:00.000Z	bazhang	richard	this is a pcmcia card? sometimes can be risky hotplugging those or was this a restart situation
2008-05-01T06:14:00.000Z	richard	bazhang	yes, pcmcia.  I'm back online now though, after a hotplug - didn't work immediately after reboot a couple of times though
2008-05-01T06:16:00.000Z	richard	bazhang	thanks - I'll go fiddle with it some more
2010-08-16T05:20:00.000Z	bazhang	richard	not supported here
