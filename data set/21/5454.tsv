2008-03-28T09:54:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	kelvin911	you have compizconfig-settings-manager?
2008-03-28T09:55:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	kelvin911	go to animation --> close effect
2008-03-28T09:56:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	kelvin911	then double click the current effect to edit
2008-03-28T09:56:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	kelvin911	"burn" is the fire effect
2008-03-28T09:57:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	kelvin911	you want burn when you close?
2008-03-28T09:58:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	kelvin911	go to the "close" tab
2008-03-28T09:59:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	kelvin911	ok great
2008-03-28T10:00:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	kelvin911	now for the shydome, go to the desktop cube --> appearance --> skydome
2008-03-28T10:04:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	kelvin911	the skydome
2008-03-28T10:04:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	kelvin911	^
2008-04-14T10:02:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	kelvin911	checking the number of people in respective channels (#ubuntu and #fedora) will give you a slight idea...
2008-04-14T10:04:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	kelvin911	my suggestion is to try a distro that seems to interest you. You will learn a lot. Decide for yourself. don't just listen to anyone who says that one distro is the best
2008-04-14T10:04:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	kelvin911	hint: virtualbox helps too...
