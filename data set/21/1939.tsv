2010-08-13T01:17:00.000Z	Aeronius		Right.  So I use virtualbox, and I would like to back up my Windows virtual machine but it will take at least 2 dvd's to backup, any suggestions?
2010-08-13T01:17:00.000Z	Aeronius		None, is there a program to break files into parts?
2010-08-13T01:18:00.000Z	Aeronius		I have a lot of blank dvds
2010-08-13T01:18:00.000Z	Aeronius		I was thinking maybe RAR or some command line utility could do that
2010-08-13T01:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Aeronius	split is a simple terminal based utility for splitting files.
2010-11-18T13:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Aeronius	They both use the same installer, and can both install either desktop or server. The difference is that the "Alternate" install CD contains all of the packages needed for ubuntu-desktop on the CD so you don't need to download them during install, and the "Server" install CD contains all the pacakges needed for ubuntu-server.
2010-11-19T01:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Aeronius	It's very unlikely that 9.10 will get a newer major version of the kernel.
2010-11-19T01:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Aeronius	It's not a speedup patch, it's a responsiveness path that helps in very specific curcomstances
2010-11-19T01:58:00.000Z	Aeronius	Jordan_U	well it would certainly help me, so is it going to be in the next kernel? or am I going to have to upgrade to 11.04?
2010-11-19T02:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Aeronius	I belive this will work with 9.10, though I haven't tested it myself: http://blog.glock.co.za/cgroup-user-space-speed-patch
2010-11-19T02:06:00.000Z	Aeronius	Jordan_U	will it be in the latest version of Ubuntu?
2010-11-27T12:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Aeronius	1 GiB should be more than enough.
2010-11-27T12:47:00.000Z	Aeronius	Jordan_U	you know the USB Startup Disk Creator in System>Administration
2010-11-27T12:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Aeronius	Yes.
2010-11-27T12:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Aeronius	It may not have had enough free space. Did you have any files on the flash drive already?
2010-11-27T12:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Aeronius	Worth a try, yes.
2010-11-27T12:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Aeronius	It's also small enough that all of the changes can be cached in RAM, then written out to disk while you're doing other things.
2010-11-27T12:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Aeronius	sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/external/
2010-11-27T12:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Aeronius	Because of the aformentioned delayed write you don't want to unplug the flash drive right after writing to it (even with gparted) without "ejecting" it (which does more than just unmounting does) or at least running "sync".
2010-11-27T13:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Aeronius	I think you're going to have problems if you try to make a bootable 10.10 USB with unetbootin or USB creator from 9.10. (though those problems would be completely unrelated to your current problem though).
2010-11-27T15:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Aeronius	Did you unplug the thumb drive without ejecting it or running "sync"?
