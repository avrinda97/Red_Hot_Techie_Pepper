2009-07-24T07:01:00.000Z	Jaredu		Hey, can anyone help me set up a terminal button involving xwinwrap? I have a neat setup for it but I can't seem to make a launcher button- it works fine in a normal terminal.
2009-07-24T07:01:00.000Z	Jaredu		sorry about the guest name thing

2009-07-24T07:03:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Jaredu	did you check the "run in terminal" box in the launcher preferences?
2009-07-24T07:03:00.000Z	Jaredu	DarwinSurvivor	where would that be? I haven't worked with this in awhile and the last time i tried was in 8.10, one sec
2009-07-24T07:04:00.000Z	Jaredu	DarwinSurvivor	for some reason that's not working... hmm
2009-07-24T07:04:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Jaredu	right-click the launcher, then select "Properties".  Change "Type" to "Application In Terminal"
2009-07-24T07:05:00.000Z	Jaredu	DarwinSurvivor	the command i'm running is this: xwinwrap -ni -o 0.6 -fs -s -st -sp -b -nf -- mplayer -wid WID -quiet ~/Desktop/testlegs.avi -loop 0 -nosound -fs
2009-07-24T07:05:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Jaredu	what happens when you click the launcher after changing the type?
2009-07-24T07:06:00.000Z	Jaredu	DarwinSurvivor	it does nothing.. when i open a terminal and paste in the exact same command it works fine
2009-07-24T07:06:00.000Z	Jaredu	DarwinSurvivor	ive also tried putting it in startup and it does nothing =\
2009-07-24T07:07:00.000Z	Jaredu	DarwinSurvivor	i did just install gnome-do if that would change anything
2009-07-24T07:07:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Jaredu	I use gnome-do myself and haven't had it mess anything up
2009-07-24T07:07:00.000Z	Jaredu	DarwinSurvivor	kk one second
2009-07-24T07:08:00.000Z	Jaredu	DarwinSurvivor	adding && sleep 10 does nothing, it opens a terminal breifly then crashes it
2009-07-24T07:08:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Jaredu	that is VERY strange...
2009-07-24T07:09:00.000Z	Jaredu	DarwinSurvivor	it worked fine in 8.10 or 8.04 im not sure what's changed :\
2009-07-24T07:16:00.000Z	Jaredu	DarwinSurvivor	do you know of a way to just launch a terminal and then run a command?
2009-07-24T07:17:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Jaredu	try "bash <command>" in the launcher
2009-07-24T07:20:00.000Z	Jaredu	DarwinSurvivor	no luck :(
