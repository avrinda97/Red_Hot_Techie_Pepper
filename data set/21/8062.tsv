2006-10-09T13:35:00.000Z	Ademan	patbam	is the tcl8.4 package installed?
2006-10-09T13:35:00.000Z	patbam	Ademan	checking
2006-10-09T13:36:00.000Z	patbam	Ademan	no, should i go ahead and install it?
2006-10-09T13:42:00.000Z	Ademan	patbam	well harisundis right, i misunderstood your goal
2006-10-09T13:42:00.000Z	patbam	Ademan	so i should go ahead and try "apt-get build-dep python" ?
2006-10-09T13:42:00.000Z	patbam	Ademan	er,  "sudo apt-get build-dep python" ?
2006-10-09T13:43:00.000Z	patbam	Ademan	 well i could just go ahead and install the dev thing, huh? probably wouldn't cause any problem
2006-10-09T13:44:00.000Z	Ademan	patbam	true, but it could be depending on A LOT more than just tcl8.4-dev, what harishund described will install everything you need, which is a good plan
2006-10-09T13:44:00.000Z	patbam	Ademan	okay, thanks
2006-10-09T13:52:00.000Z	patbam	Ademan	harisund: took me a few minutes on a prehistoric fedora box (which ended up only sorta working) and just a couple on a recent laptop with dapper
2006-10-09T13:53:00.000Z	Ademan	patbam	i guess i overestimated the size of python :-p
2006-10-09T13:54:00.000Z	patbam	Ademan	maybe you were thinking of java ;)
2006-10-09T13:54:00.000Z	Ademan	patbam	the longest thing i've ever written took about a minute to compile...
2006-10-09T13:55:00.000Z	patbam	Ademan	if you're a newb, i'm an oobernoob, because i stay away from any language that needs a compiler :)
2006-10-09T13:55:00.000Z	Ademan	patbam	hah, take the time to learn c or c++, they're important you know...  python is great too though, i'm starting to learn python cause its very powerful
2006-10-09T13:56:00.000Z	patbam	Ademan	c++ and i had a very unloving and disastrous love affair
2006-10-09T13:57:00.000Z	Ademan	patbam	what happened? lol
2006-10-09T13:57:00.000Z	patbam	Ademan	i went screaming back to my scripting languages :)
2006-10-09T13:57:00.000Z	Ademan	patbam	the concept of variable type? haha
2006-10-09T13:59:00.000Z	patbam	Ademan	i'm firmly in the latter group O.o
2006-10-09T14:00:00.000Z	patbam	Ademan	try a frootloops box :)
