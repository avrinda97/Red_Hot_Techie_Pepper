2005-08-27T13:56:00.000Z	tomaj	topyli	i need to get azureus running
2005-08-27T13:57:00.000Z	topyli	tomaj	why azureus? it's just one option of many
2005-08-27T13:57:00.000Z	tomaj	topyli	because its leet and my bittorrent client of choice, do you know how to get it running from tty1?
2005-08-27T13:58:00.000Z	topyli	tomaj	it's an X app, and a java app, so honestly i don't

2005-08-27T16:00:00.000Z	tomaj	topyli	lollercycle
2005-08-27T16:02:00.000Z	topyli	tomaj	like i said, it's an X program and a java program at that. you must start X
2005-08-27T16:02:00.000Z	tomaj	topyli	x is started in tty7

2005-08-27T16:03:00.000Z	topyli	tomaj	make another user and make it the azureus user so it won't bother you
2005-08-27T16:04:00.000Z	topyli	tomaj	but then you have two X's running
2005-08-28T12:27:00.000Z	topyli	tomaj	serpentine is in hoary-extras i think, it's not in hoary
2005-08-28T12:33:00.000Z	topyli	tomaj	can't find serpentine? i got it from backports
2005-08-28T12:41:00.000Z	topyli	tomaj	it's true, i sometimes have to convert some oggs to mp3, but i only make copies without losing the oggs :)
