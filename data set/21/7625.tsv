2006-08-19T12:24:00.000Z	BenB__		Hello, does anyone have an idea where I could get warty-4.10.iso ?
2006-08-19T12:25:00.000Z	BenB__		why isn't it?
2006-08-19T12:25:00.000Z	BenB__		can't I run iso files from it?
2006-08-19T12:25:00.000Z	Flannel	BenB__	it's more than 18 months old
2006-08-19T12:25:00.000Z	Flannel	BenB__	Ubuntu releases are supported for 18 months (except LTS ones)
2006-08-19T12:26:00.000Z	Flannel	BenB__	you want to install over a network?
2006-08-19T12:27:00.000Z	Flannel	BenB__	so, you want to do a netinstall then, right?
2006-08-19T12:27:00.000Z	Flannel	BenB__	that's what this page is suggesting
2006-08-19T12:27:00.000Z	Flannel	BenB__	You don't need warty, you can install with any version, here's a good url of various install methods
2006-08-19T12:28:00.000Z	Flannel	BenB__	that'll cover all your bases, you should be able to get something to work.  And, you don't need warty, Dapper should work just as well (get the alternate ISO)
2006-08-19T12:29:00.000Z	Flannel	BenB__	dapper is the newest version, released last june.  Warty was released in October of 04 (4.10)
2006-08-19T12:29:00.000Z	Flannel	BenB__	read that page, you'll find something.
2006-08-19T12:38:00.000Z	Flannel	BenB__	no, there are some that don't.  Although, to be honest, if you have no CDrom, and no internet connection, how are you planning on getting the ISO on the computer to begin with?
2006-08-19T12:40:00.000Z	Flannel	BenB__	what do you have on the computer currently?
2006-08-19T12:40:00.000Z	Flannel	BenB__	No current OS?
2006-08-19T12:41:00.000Z	Flannel	BenB__	did you see this page from that page? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromWindows
2006-08-19T12:42:00.000Z	Flannel	BenB__	also, this page: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromHardDriveWithFloppies
2006-08-19T12:43:00.000Z	Flannel	BenB__	no, that floppy thing is just to get a basic linux system running, once you do that, you can mount your ISO as a CDrom, and work from there.  read the pages, not just the headings
2006-08-19T12:43:00.000Z	Flannel	BenB__	and, that first page (the windows one) shows you how to set up that basic linux system, which you can then use in conjunction with the second page
2006-08-19T13:04:00.000Z	BenB__	Flannel	I just found a Celeron 1GHz 256MB RAM with a CD drive there. Think the CD installation would work if I put my HD there?
2006-08-19T13:04:00.000Z	Flannel	BenB__	uh, sure.
