2008-09-25T04:22:00.000Z	Gerinych	trimeta	alright, i'm looking in gparted
2008-09-25T04:18:00.000Z	trimeta	Gerinych	Have you tried going to Grub's screen and playing around with the tab completion to see if it can see your Mac disc? Actually, do you have any idea how your second HD is partitioned?
2008-09-25T04:19:00.000Z	Gerinych	trimeta	not sure what you mean about tabs, but I do know how my hd is partitioned
2008-09-25T04:19:00.000Z	Gerinych	trimeta	it has one hfs+ partition and a mac-native partition table
2008-09-25T04:20:00.000Z	trimeta	Gerinych	Basically, if you write your menu.list pretty much correctly (except for the proper HD name), you can go to the Grub screen, choose "Edit entry," edit the line with the HD, and then it'll have tab completion of all the drives and partitions it sees.
2008-09-25T04:21:00.000Z	Gerinych	trimeta	ah, that. Yeah, i tried doing that, but the error says that the partition table is corrupt, not that it can find a partition
2008-09-25T04:21:00.000Z	Gerinych	trimeta	*can't
2008-09-25T04:21:00.000Z	trimeta	Gerinych	You said you know how the disk is partitioned...could you elaborate?
2008-09-25T04:24:00.000Z	Gerinych	trimeta	it goes /dev/sdb1, filesystem: unknown, no mountpoint, size: 31.50 KB; I suspect that's the partition table
2008-09-25T04:25:00.000Z	trimeta	Gerinych	That would probably be seen by Grub as (hd1,0)
2008-09-25T04:25:00.000Z	Gerinych	trimeta	then it's 128 MB of unallocated space, and /dev/sdb3, filesystem: hfs+, mountpoint: /media/Untitled 1
2008-09-25T04:26:00.000Z	Gerinych	trimeta	hold on, let me try that
2008-09-25T04:30:00.000Z	Gerinych	trimeta	nope, it gives me an error "partition table invalid or corrupt"
2008-09-25T04:31:00.000Z	trimeta	Gerinych	Hmm. This is a disc you pulled straight out of a Mac, I'm guessing?
2008-09-25T04:31:00.000Z	Gerinych	trimeta	no, it's a sata hard drive I bought just for a mac install
2008-09-25T04:31:00.000Z	trimeta	Gerinych	You could always try redoing everything...
2008-09-25T04:32:00.000Z	Gerinych	trimeta	so how should i redo it then?
2008-09-25T04:32:00.000Z	trimeta	Gerinych	How much of the OSx86 install have you done?
2008-09-25T04:32:00.000Z	Gerinych	trimeta	I just installed it and never booted it because hrub won't let me
2008-09-25T04:32:00.000Z	Gerinych	trimeta	*grub
2008-09-25T04:33:00.000Z	trimeta	Gerinych	Can I PM you about this? It's not exactly a Ubuntu-related topic.
