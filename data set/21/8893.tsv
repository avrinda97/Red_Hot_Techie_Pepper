2005-12-22T13:14:00.000Z	cartesian1984	ElitePete	i did, whats the problem
2005-12-22T13:16:00.000Z	ElitePete	cartesian1984	i can't seem to open the ports on my virtual machine for starcraft
2005-12-22T13:16:00.000Z	cartesian1984	ElitePete	what guest OS?
2005-12-22T13:16:00.000Z	ElitePete	cartesian1984	xp pro sp2
2005-12-22T13:17:00.000Z	cartesian1984	ElitePete	you have bridged networking set up?
2005-12-22T13:17:00.000Z	ElitePete	cartesian1984	nat networking, i can't get bridged to work
2005-12-22T13:17:00.000Z	ElitePete	cartesian1984	i have edited the nat.conf file but people still can't join my games
2005-12-22T13:18:00.000Z	cartesian1984	ElitePete	its going to be hard without bridged networking, i didn't think 3D acceleration worked in vmware anyway, so i never really gamed
2005-12-22T13:18:00.000Z	ElitePete	cartesian1984	can you help me setup bridged then?
2005-12-22T13:18:00.000Z	ElitePete	cartesian1984	sc runs fine, just people can't connect to my game.
2005-12-22T13:19:00.000Z	cartesian1984	ElitePete	it been a while, ask in #vmware, ill try and find you an FAQ
2005-12-22T13:19:00.000Z	ElitePete	cartesian1984	they all afk in #vmware
2005-12-22T13:20:00.000Z	cartesian1984	ElitePete	ah. a shame. I'll look into it then
2005-12-22T13:21:00.000Z	ElitePete		means he is ops.
2005-12-22T13:22:00.000Z	cartesian1984	ElitePete	what was the problem with bridged networking?
2005-12-22T13:22:00.000Z	ElitePete	cartesian1984	it just doesn't let my virtual machine online..
2005-12-22T13:23:00.000Z	cartesian1984	ElitePete	strange. I wonder if the new version of Xen or Bochs can run windows. vmware was just too much of a hassle for me
2005-12-22T13:24:00.000Z	ElitePete	cartesian1984	all i want is to be able to host sc games :-)
2005-12-22T13:35:00.000Z	ElitePete		anyone here run broodwar on wine? if so do you get the battle.net crash also?
2005-12-22T13:36:00.000Z	cartesian1984	ElitePete	theres an emulator created solely for the purpose of running windows under linux, its called Win4Lin. I advise you to obtain a copy, its supposed to be substantially better than vmware
