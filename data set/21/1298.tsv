2011-03-21T19:48:00.000Z	shaneo		is it safe to remove samba4 if i dont use it
2011-03-21T19:48:00.000Z	BluesKaj	shaneo	yes
2011-03-21T19:49:00.000Z	BluesKaj	shaneo	just regular samba should work
2012-07-03T00:36:00.000Z	BluesKaj	shaneo	paste it in imagebin so we can have a look
2012-07-03T00:36:00.000Z	shaneo	BluesKaj	ok 1 sec
2012-07-03T00:36:00.000Z	shaneo	BluesKaj	http://screencloud.net/v/iMHp
2012-07-03T00:37:00.000Z	shaneo	BluesKaj	i should tell you that all sound works except within any web browser
2012-07-03T00:41:00.000Z	BluesKaj	shaneo	you need pulseaudio and pavucontrol for webaudio , most likely , as for the internal ctrls , U think those are your HDMI audio , probly not needed unless you have HDMI feeding your TV or audio receiver with HDMI inputs
2012-07-03T00:41:00.000Z	shaneo	BluesKaj	i have pulse audio not sure about pavucontrol 1 sec
2012-07-03T00:43:00.000Z	shaneo	BluesKaj	pavucontrol wasnt installed. fingers crossed that it fixes my problem
2012-07-03T00:44:00.000Z	shaneo	BluesKaj	still no luck :(
2012-07-03T00:45:00.000Z	BluesKaj	shaneo	it helps direct your audio to the the proper outputs , of course you have to set that up in pulseaudio as well, (phonon audio hardware setup)
2012-07-03T00:47:00.000Z	shaneo	BluesKaj	via pulse audio volume controls?
2012-07-03T00:55:00.000Z	BluesKaj	shaneo	you'll find the pavucontrol will show some audio output options , with a sound test for them
2012-07-03T00:56:00.000Z	shaneo	BluesKaj	all system sounds are fine its only chromium, firefox, opera, chrome, and iron to name a few. They dont even show up in pavu
2012-07-03T00:56:00.000Z	shaneo	BluesKaj	the only app that shows in is screencloud
2012-07-03T00:58:00.000Z	BluesKaj	shaneo	the options for browser audio won't show , pavucontrol is global , you may need to reboot , thewn try the youtube or some such to test the audio portion
2012-07-03T00:58:00.000Z	shaneo	BluesKaj	ok ill reboot and let you know how things go
2012-07-03T01:07:00.000Z	shaneo	BluesKaj	still no sound in browser :(
2012-07-03T01:10:00.000Z	BluesKaj	shaneo	but the video plays fine , correct ? Download an flv file from youtube with youtube-dl  , then try it without the browser
2012-07-03T01:26:00.000Z	BluesKaj	shaneo	try this , thanks to Dr_willis , https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/flashvideoreplacer/
