2008-05-07T12:31:00.000Z	casdf		hello; im working on installing ubuntu on a lenovo r61i, trying to dual boot it with vista
2008-05-07T12:31:00.000Z	casdf		there's a lenovo recovery partition, the vista partition, and the new ext3 and swap partitions that ubuntu is creating. will a bootloader mess up my ability to use the recovery partition?
2008-05-07T12:33:00.000Z	starcannon	casdf	i preserved the recovery partition on this hp laptop, it even shows up in grub, presumably I could turn this back into a windows laptop, but I've never tried that so I have no idea if it would work or not, I only kept it just in case I ever sell this thing on ebay when I'm done with it
2008-05-07T12:33:00.000Z	casdf	starcannon	did you install the bootloader from the ubuntu install though?
2008-05-07T12:34:00.000Z	casdf	starcannon	because i fear that may prevent usage of the recovery software
2008-05-07T12:35:00.000Z	casdf	starcannon	and if i don't install the bootloader, how will i load up ubuntu on boot?
2008-05-07T12:36:00.000Z	starcannon	casdf	I did a full install of Ubuntu as soon as the laptop arrived by fedex, never even booted it into windows, during the install process I chose manual during the partitioning portion, and made sure to NOT delete or format the recovery partition, not sure if that answers your question but thats how I did it, I don't know if the recovery partition works or not, I will only try it when the computer is no longer useful to me
2008-05-07T12:37:00.000Z	casdf	starcannon	ok, thanks a lot. i'm gonna give it a try without the bootloader; worst case, i can set up the boot cmd under windows
2008-05-07T13:45:00.000Z	starcannon	casdf	what brand of computer is that?
2008-05-07T13:45:00.000Z	casdf	starcannon	lenovo r61i, i think you mentioned you had similar
2008-05-07T13:46:00.000Z	starcannon	casdf	I have similar restore setup
2008-05-07T13:46:00.000Z	starcannon	casdf	I dont know how lenevo does things but on this hp for $20 i can buy a set of restore cd's
2008-05-07T13:46:00.000Z	casdf	starcannon	i hear that if i call them up i can get a set, but i've not tried yet
2008-05-07T13:47:00.000Z	starcannon	casdf	if the ability to restore windows when its inevitability occurs is important to you, i'd not trust the restore partition to survive even if I weren't trying to dual boot another os
2008-05-07T13:47:00.000Z	casdf	starcannon	yeah, its not a great option
2008-05-07T14:00:00.000Z	starcannon	casdf	you can choose where to install grub, it can go in mbr or anywhere you send it, any partition on a hdd
2008-05-07T14:01:00.000Z	casdf	starcannon	you mean during the ubuntu install sequence?
2008-05-07T14:01:00.000Z	casdf	starcannon	if so, i may just try reinstalling ubuntu
2008-05-07T14:01:00.000Z	starcannon	casdf	during ubuntu install, after the partitioning bit, theres a button that says "advanced" on it, if you click that you can see a list of available places to install grub to
2008-05-07T14:04:00.000Z	casdf	starcannon	ok, thanks a lot.
