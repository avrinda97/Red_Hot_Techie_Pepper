2006-01-10T14:10:00.000Z	techone		ok XP is bad but how do I fix firefox
2006-01-10T14:11:00.000Z	techone		ok when I installed this box it was kernel 2.6.5 but now here is also 2.6.10 and 2.6.12
2006-01-10T14:11:00.000Z	techone		could these upgrades have caused conflicts
2006-01-10T14:12:00.000Z	aftertaf	techone	 you have a locales problem, my guess is that it isnt limited to firefox.
2006-01-10T14:12:00.000Z	aftertaf	techone	 what is actually crashing? specific soft? or everything? or the system?
2006-01-10T14:14:00.000Z	techone	aftertaf	well im told using firefox then scrolling the mouse a lot, openoffice was crashing on saves but he kept saving every two lines because of it
2006-01-10T14:15:00.000Z	techone	aftertaf	and then the screen settings were some screwed up 640x480 and 60 hz but squwiggly
2006-01-10T14:15:00.000Z	aftertaf	techone	 is it an nvidia card?
2006-01-10T14:16:00.000Z	aftertaf	techone	 for the kernel, grab the metapackage that is for the processor (k7 / 686) and you can also remove the older ones if you want
2006-01-10T14:18:00.000Z	techone	aftertaf	doing some research I confirmed that essentially everything before athlon 2200+ is 32bit and some 2200+ are 64 bit and basically everything after that is 64 bit
2006-01-10T14:20:00.000Z	aftertaf	techone	 is the pc on breezy? has anything else been installed or compiled on it, or any backports installed?
2006-01-10T14:24:00.000Z	techone	aftertaf	ok I was looking to confirm if this is breezy
2006-01-10T14:42:00.000Z	aftertaf	techone	 but if random crashes like that dont occur with win, it could be the installation that is messed up.. maybe even the install cd.
2006-01-10T14:45:00.000Z	techone	aftertaf	part of why I put on Edubuntu, actually cause hes a teacher, is because of random nonsense freezes and resets - I ran some hardware diagnostic at the time which came up with no complaints
2006-01-10T14:46:00.000Z	aftertaf	techone	 memory!   sounds like bad ram. try testing Sim by Sim
2006-01-10T14:46:00.000Z	aftertaf	techone	 i;e. take one out and see if it happens, then swap and try the other one
2006-01-10T14:48:00.000Z	techone	aftertaf	ive run extensive memory test well mem86+ for a dozen hours or so
2006-01-10T14:48:00.000Z	aftertaf	techone	 even so...
2006-01-10T14:48:00.000Z	aftertaf	techone	 i'd do the physical swapping bit.
2006-01-10T14:49:00.000Z	aftertaf	techone	 only way to be 100% certain about a hardware item is to remove it ;)
2006-01-10T15:03:00.000Z	aftertaf	techone	 grab the kubuntu dvd iso ;)
