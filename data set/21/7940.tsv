2006-06-15T08:50:00.000Z	rigonatti		=( someone with patiente to teach how to configure and use Wine ? I had tryed all tutorials but still getting erros =(
2006-06-15T08:52:00.000Z	v0lksman	rigonatti	 google search for lotus notes running in wine and you should find a step by step of getting Lotus to run under wine....it should answer a lot of your questions on how wine works...

2006-06-15T08:53:00.000Z	v0lksman	rigonatti	 there is no easy answer for wine...its a tricky app....
2006-06-15T08:54:00.000Z	v0lksman	rigonatti	 first why PS?  why not Gimp?  second:  wine "c:\program files\adobe\photoshop\photoshop.exe"
2006-06-15T08:54:00.000Z	v0lksman	rigonatti	 you have to specify full windows path as it is under the .wine dir
2006-06-15T08:55:00.000Z	rigonatti		first:   GIMP open .PS or .AI   ???   second :  I have tryed this path ... =( ....
2006-06-15T08:55:00.000Z	rigonatti		you mean c:/windows ?
2006-06-15T08:55:00.000Z	v0lksman	rigonatti	 I thoguht gimp could handle .PS....
2006-06-15T08:56:00.000Z	rigonatti		.AI too ?
2006-06-15T08:56:00.000Z	v0lksman	rigonatti	 you must get a second error when using c:\program path....
2006-06-15T08:56:00.000Z	v0lksman	rigonatti	 not sure...try it...can't hurt....already installed by default in dapper
2006-06-15T08:56:00.000Z	rigonatti		just PS :(

2006-06-15T08:58:00.000Z	v0lksman		that's the same thing you sent last time
2006-06-15T08:58:00.000Z	v0lksman		do a 'pwd' in the directory that photoshop.exe is sitting in and send that over
2006-06-15T09:00:00.000Z	rigonatti		nope
2006-06-15T09:01:00.000Z	rigonatti	v0lksman	: I cant figure out how do this ....even if a APP works with ADobe Files =(
2006-06-15T09:05:00.000Z	v0lksman	rigonatti	 I'm not sure what you mean...
