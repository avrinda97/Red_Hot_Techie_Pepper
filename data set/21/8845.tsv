2006-06-08T11:05:00.000Z	tritium	dr3wster	you're not.  That's an unfortunate situation you have to deal with
2006-06-08T11:06:00.000Z	tritium	dr3wster	worst case, you could wipe out some of your hidden directories that store gnome settings
2006-06-08T11:06:00.000Z	tritium	dr3wster	usually you install ubuntu-desktop to get gnome
2006-06-08T11:06:00.000Z	dr3wster	tritium	where would I find those hidden directories?
2006-06-08T11:07:00.000Z	tritium	dr3wster	in your user
2006-06-08T11:08:00.000Z	dr3wster	tritium	/home/drew/.gnome?
2006-06-08T11:09:00.000Z	tritium	dr3wster	or .gconf, perhaps
2006-06-08T11:09:00.000Z	dr3wster	tritium	 so it's safe to just delete the whole file?
2006-06-08T11:19:00.000Z	tritium	dr3wster	does the keyboard shortcut work (Ctrl-Alt-L) ?
2006-06-08T11:09:00.000Z	tritium	dr3wster	it's a directory, and be aware that it'll delate all kinds of settings
2006-06-08T11:10:00.000Z	dr3wster	tritium	settings that I need to have my computer actually work?
2006-06-08T11:11:00.000Z	tritium	dr3wster	not the system, but evolution is a good example
2006-06-08T11:11:00.000Z	tritium	dr3wster	hopefully you'll get it resolved soon :)
2006-06-08T11:12:00.000Z	dr3wster	tritium	I hope so too.  I always seem to have some problem with these bi-annual upgrades.
2006-06-08T11:12:00.000Z	dr3wster	tritium	haha, compared to winXP this is cake.
2006-06-08T11:18:00.000Z	tritium	dr3wster	no, not at all.  You mean lock the screen?
2006-06-08T11:18:00.000Z	dr3wster	tritium	yes, it won't let me, I click it and nothing happens
2006-06-08T11:20:00.000Z	dr3wster	tritium	nope, neither does my panel shortcut or doing it from the shut down menu
2006-06-08T11:20:00.000Z	tritium	dr3wster	not sure what happened there
2006-06-08T11:22:00.000Z	dr3wster	tritium	yeah, I guess I'm lucky that updates don't completely screw up my computer, but I just get these annoying little idiosyncracies
2006-06-08T11:28:00.000Z	dr3wster	tritium	chennaituxian, farous, that didn't fix it.  Wanna see the error I get when I boot?
