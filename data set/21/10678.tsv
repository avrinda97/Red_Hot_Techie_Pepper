2004-12-24T13:50:00.000Z	declan		I am mounting an NTFS drive in linux, edited /etc/fstab created a windows folder in /media to mount it to, but its only allowing root to access it, i have it to be able to be user mounted, but it only allows root to access it, wondering how to allow user to access it
2004-12-24T13:50:00.000Z	gecko[au] 	declan	you need to use the "user" option in fstab on the line that refers to the mount point
2004-12-24T13:51:00.000Z	declan		yes i have that
2004-12-24T13:51:00.000Z	declan		hold on lemme get you ms fstab line

2004-12-24T13:59:00.000Z	gecko[au] 	declan	its a bit like the difference between kill -1 PID and kill - 1 PID
