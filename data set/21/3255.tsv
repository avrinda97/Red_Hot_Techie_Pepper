2009-02-20T14:07:00.000Z	illumin8	Rev_Slid3r	when you started editing your xorg file as you said earlier you saved it correct?
2009-02-20T14:07:00.000Z	Rev_Slid3r		well
2009-02-20T14:07:00.000Z	Rev_Slid3r		theres not much in it
2009-02-20T14:08:00.000Z	illumin8	Rev_Slid3r	inside the xorg folder there should be a file with xorg.conf~ or xorg.~?
2009-02-20T14:08:00.000Z	Rev_Slid3r		id really like to just remove the session file or whatever and let it rescan
2009-02-20T14:08:00.000Z	illumin8		the ~ would identify it as a pre edit file.
2009-02-20T14:08:00.000Z	Rev_Slid3r		theres none of that
2009-02-20T14:08:00.000Z	illumin8		hmm
