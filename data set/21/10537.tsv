2009-03-28T22:47:00.000Z	carbine	HammerHead66	That tells me to do something with ATI drivers. I have an nvidia card.
2009-03-28T22:49:00.000Z	carbine	HammerHead66	You've already sent me there once. Like I said, I have an NVIDIA card.
2009-03-28T22:50:00.000Z	carbine	HammerHead66	I've installed nvidia's native drivers.
2009-03-28T22:51:00.000Z	carbine	HammerHead66	After that's over and nvidia's installer creates a xorg.conf file I run into issues.
2009-03-28T22:53:00.000Z	carbine	HammerHead66	yes.
2009-03-28T22:53:00.000Z	carbine	HammerHead66	I HAVE AN NVIDIA CARD.
2009-03-28T22:53:00.000Z	carbine	HammerHead66	NOT ATI.
2009-03-28T22:53:00.000Z	carbine	HammerHead66	3rd time I've stated this.
2009-03-28T22:54:00.000Z	carbine	HammerHead66	I think I'm just going to shoot myself.
2009-03-28T22:55:00.000Z	carbine	HammerHead66	At all these guides that tell me to enable restricted drivers that don't work, or to install native drivers from nvidia that don't work?
2009-03-28T22:55:00.000Z	carbine	HammerHead66	8.10
