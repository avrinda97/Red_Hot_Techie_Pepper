2012-05-28T17:13:00.000Z	csilk		Anyone able to help with that ^ ?
2012-05-28T17:14:00.000Z	popey	csilk	whats type of file is /home/username/eclipse/eclipse ?
2012-05-28T17:15:00.000Z	csilk	popey	it's the eclipse executable
2012-05-28T17:15:00.000Z	csilk		executable (application/x-executable)
2012-05-28T17:15:00.000Z	popey	csilk	why run it with "/bin/sh", why not specify it directly
2012-05-28T17:15:00.000Z	csilk	popey	I get the same error when I run it directly
2012-05-28T17:16:00.000Z	popey	csilk	what version of eclipse?
2012-05-28T17:16:00.000Z	csilk		ponpon, latest
2012-05-28T17:16:00.000Z	csilk		* popey latest
2012-05-28T17:17:00.000Z	popey	csilk	i installed 3.7.2-1 from the ubuntu repo and it comes with a desktop file which works fine..
2012-05-28T17:17:00.000Z	csilk	popey	the .desktop file in the latest version (not repo) is the same as the .desktop from the repo and doesn't work fine for me
2012-05-28T17:18:00.000Z	popey	csilk	the one you posted isn't the same as the one from the repo
2012-05-28T17:18:00.000Z	csilk	popey	I switched to using the one from the repo about 20 minutes ago
2012-05-28T17:18:00.000Z	popey	csilk	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1011244/
2012-05-28T17:19:00.000Z	popey	csilk	and for that it doesn't run the eclipse executable, it runs /usr/bin/eclipse which is a shell script
2012-05-28T17:19:00.000Z	csilk	popey	actually you're right. I cannot use the one from the repo as I didn't get eclipse from the repo due to it being too old
2012-05-28T17:20:00.000Z	csilk	popey	the repo .desktop assumes eclipse is installed via the package manager. The common way of installing the latest version of eclipse is to just run the exec from the home/username folder. That is what my .desktop is trying to do
2012-05-28T17:20:00.000Z	popey	csilk	sure, I was thinking you could base your .desktop off the one I pastebinned
2012-05-28T17:20:00.000Z	csilk	popey	I would have to create a shell script in /bin for that to work
2012-05-28T17:21:00.000Z	popey	csilk	nah, anywhere in path like ~/bin would be fine
