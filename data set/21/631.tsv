2011-12-01T03:48:00.000Z	x_	olividir	give xubuntu (xfce) a shot it's pretty low resources.
2011-12-01T03:50:00.000Z	x_	olividir	is it a laptop or desktop.
2011-12-01T03:50:00.000Z	olividir	x_	laptop
2011-12-01T03:51:00.000Z	x_	olividir	maybe ubuntu throttled your processors on this version. intel processors?
2011-12-01T03:51:00.000Z	x_	olividir	some mobile processors can run in lower performance / power mode.
2011-12-01T03:52:00.000Z	olividir	x_	its always on full power, have no battery plugged in
2011-12-01T03:52:00.000Z	x_	olividir	do you have the applet that shows what performance mode your processors are in ?
2011-12-01T03:52:00.000Z	x_	olividir	cpu freq scaling monitor.

2011-12-01T03:53:00.000Z	olividir	x_	i just need some direction how to do that, feel very lost on the new ubuntu
2011-12-01T03:54:00.000Z	x_	olividir	right click your panel and it's an applet that you add to the gnome panel.

2011-12-01T03:56:00.000Z	olividir	x_	nothing happens when i right click it, unless if im over an applet, then that starts
2011-12-01T03:56:00.000Z	x_	olividir	see im not sure cause i don't use unity ( i think that's unity) do you have a gnome panel?
