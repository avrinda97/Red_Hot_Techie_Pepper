2006-01-26T13:40:00.000Z	Ng	coolboy	almost certainly IA32, unless you are running the 64bit version of ubuntu
2006-01-28T10:58:00.000Z	Ng	coolboy	fire up synaptic and search for game
2006-01-28T11:00:00.000Z	coolboy	Ng	what do I do when I found game?
2006-01-28T11:00:00.000Z	Ng	coolboy	right click on the packages you are interested in and choose the mark for install option, then when you are finished selecting them, hit Apply on the toolbar
2006-01-28T11:01:00.000Z	coolboy	Ng	I know how to install
2006-01-28T11:01:00.000Z	Ng	coolboy	then what did you mean?
2006-01-28T11:02:00.000Z	coolboy	Ng	but some games don't appear in apps-games
2006-01-28T11:02:00.000Z	coolboy	Ng	where are they to find
2006-01-28T11:02:00.000Z	Ng	coolboy	ah, they should, but maybe they don't have icons. you can right click on a package once its installed and get a list of files it owns, look for ones in /usr/bin/ - that is what you need to run from a terminal most likely
2006-01-28T11:03:00.000Z	coolboy	Ng	thx
2006-01-28T11:08:00.000Z	coolboy	Ng	i see the list of files: but no files are actually there, some folders even don't exist
2006-01-28T11:08:00.000Z	coolboy	Ng	could it be they are installed under root acc
2006-01-28T11:09:00.000Z	Ng	coolboy	unlikely, was the package definitely installed?
2006-01-28T11:12:00.000Z	coolboy	Ng	yes it was
2006-01-28T11:12:00.000Z	coolboy	Ng	it said so
2006-01-28T11:13:00.000Z	coolboy	Ng	It's very strange
2006-01-28T11:15:00.000Z	Ng	coolboy	hmm, well "dpkg -L packagename" in a terminal (you may need to quit synaptic for that to work) should give you a list of files that are installed, so unless something went wrong and removed them that should be definitive
2006-01-28T11:17:00.000Z	coolboy	Ng	it gives the same list: but I can't find any of them, neither thru terminal
2006-01-28T11:25:00.000Z	coolboy	Ng	i found them
