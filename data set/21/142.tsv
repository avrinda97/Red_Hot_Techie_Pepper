2012-08-06T22:47:00.000Z	ls612		Does anyone have any idea what I need to do to get my internet working? (or more specifically, what driver I need to get)
2012-08-06T22:47:00.000Z	ls612		Wired.
2012-08-06T22:48:00.000Z	ls612		I have an Atheros AR8161/8165 Ethernet Adapter
2012-08-06T22:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ls612	can you ping 8.8.8.8 ?
2012-08-06T22:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ls612	can you ping your routers internal P address?
2012-08-06T22:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ls612	what is the output of:  lsb_release -sc
2012-08-06T22:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ls612	ctrl+shift+c to copy and ctrl+shift+v to paste, or use mouse
2012-08-06T22:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ls612	that tells us nothing
2012-08-06T22:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ls612	if you can run:  sudo lshw -C network   in Ubuntu, copy the file to the NTFS (as windows is garbage and cannot read Ext4), you can then pastebin it
2012-08-06T23:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ls612	please pastebin the file :)
2012-08-06T23:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ls612	seems its not in precise yet but will be in Quantal (Ubuntu 12.10 which is pre-release now), https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/927782
2012-08-06T23:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ls612	yes but its officially not stable but could work, !wfm
2012-08-06T23:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ls612	you could always try the live CD, see if it works there :)
2012-08-06T23:11:00.000Z	ls612	ActionParsnip	Would that also make my cooling fan work properly?
2012-08-06T23:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ls612	the newer kernel may help. Do you use a switchable video chip by any chance?
2012-08-06T23:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ls612	doesn't say much, toshiba make a tonne of differnet systems
2012-08-06T23:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ls612	if you look in device manager, do you see 2 different display chips?
2012-08-06T23:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ls612	ok then it's just a single gpu, which is good :)
2012-08-07T00:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ls612	you can reinstate grub from the liveCD: http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/09/live-usb-sticking-grub-2-video
2012-08-07T00:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ls612	if you only have windows installed you will need to reinstate the windows bootloader, ##windows will help there
2012-08-07T00:25:00.000Z	ls612	ActionParsnip	Thanks, I'll go there.
