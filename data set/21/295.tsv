2012-03-26T05:26:00.000Z	ghostconn		just wondering if there is a way to make plymouth load faster in the grub file?... my problem is Im using plymouth manager and a themed splash screen. It works when i shutdown, however when I boot i see a black screen for about 10seconds and then a slight glimpse of my splash screen. (maybe half a second)

2012-03-26T09:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ghostconn	its not bad though :)
2012-03-27T05:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ghostconn	go for it, mint has its own support channels though

2012-07-16T02:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ghostconn	I'd ask in ##hardware   sorry
2012-07-16T02:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ghostconn	soul, not sole
2012-11-11T21:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ghostconn	sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade
2012-11-11T21:52:00.000Z	ghostconn	ActionParsnip	: I have already done those commands.. I have a ati hd7770 my hdmi audio shows up under sound setting/output but i get no sound??
2012-11-11T21:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ghostconn	if you run: alsamixer   are all levels maxed and unmuted? If you press F6 in alsamxer  is the right output device set?
2012-11-11T21:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ghostconn	if you run the 'sound' app in dash, is the right device set for output there?
2012-11-11T22:00:00.000Z	ghostconn	ActionParsnip	yes
2012-11-11T22:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ghostconn	worth a shot
2012-11-11T22:14:00.000Z	ghostconn	ActionParsnip	: do you think it would be wise to install the post release update ati driver if I already have a working fglrx driver installed
