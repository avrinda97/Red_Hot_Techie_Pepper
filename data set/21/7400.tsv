2007-05-03T14:19:00.000Z	ruda		where in the word gnome had use objective c?
2007-05-03T14:19:00.000Z	ruda		world
2007-05-03T14:20:00.000Z	ruda		Gnome is completely in C
2007-05-03T14:20:00.000Z	tarzeau	ruda	nobody claimed so, but look at the original goal and what the abbreviation gnome means
2007-05-03T14:20:00.000Z	tarzeau	ruda	and that's the problem :)
2007-05-03T14:22:00.000Z	tarzeau	ruda	on the other hand GNUstep never gave importance to GNU. nobody cares about FSF do we?
2007-05-03T14:25:00.000Z	tarzeau	ruda	did that ever change? gnome is no more complete crap?
2007-05-03T14:26:00.000Z	tarzeau	ruda	eck we also have http://livecd.gnustep.org/
2007-05-03T14:26:00.000Z	ruda	tarzeau	I know.. i know
2007-05-03T14:27:00.000Z	ruda	tarzeau	I'm aware of GNUStep; i use to used in a few years ago, with Window Maker. but it's like to use something from the 90's (in my point of view)
2007-05-03T14:28:00.000Z	tarzeau	ruda	you're talking about look. i'm talking about feel
2007-05-03T14:28:00.000Z	ruda	tarzeau	does gnustep have a native web browser?
2007-05-03T14:28:00.000Z	tarzeau	ruda	no it doesn't
2007-05-03T14:29:00.000Z	tarzeau	ruda	ask that in #gnustep
2007-05-03T14:29:00.000Z	ruda	tarzeau	I mean, if I want to use gnome, i expect to use tools from that environment, I never do kde apps
2007-05-03T14:29:00.000Z	tarzeau	ruda	same here
2007-05-03T14:29:00.000Z	tarzeau	ruda	i also love consistency
2007-05-03T14:29:00.000Z	ruda	tarzeau	I really like GNUSTEP... They do a nice peace of work
2007-05-03T14:29:00.000Z	tarzeau	ruda	not even k3b? i mean i hate gnome file dialogs
2007-05-03T14:30:00.000Z	tarzeau	ruda	if you ever used the original, OPENSTEP, see http://gnu.ethz.ch/www.levenez.com/ thats was even far more kickass
2007-05-03T14:30:00.000Z	ruda	tarzeau	cool pix
