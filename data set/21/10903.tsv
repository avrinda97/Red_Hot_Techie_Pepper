2004-10-14T11:54:00.000Z	linux_mafia	LinuxJones	amen
2004-11-20T14:35:00.000Z	LinuxJones	linux_mafia	I have been using update-rc.d for 4 years :)
2004-11-20T14:37:00.000Z	linux_mafia	LinuxJones	you can, but you shouldn't really, it was designed to be called by the postinst or prerm scripts, if you update a package you have removed links for, they will be reinstalled
2004-11-20T14:38:00.000Z	LinuxJones	linux_mafia	what is the alternative ?
2004-11-20T14:40:00.000Z	linux_mafia	LinuxJones	sysv-rc-conf, rcconf, manually remove startup links from default runlevel (/etc/rc2.d) iirc
2004-11-20T14:43:00.000Z	LinuxJones	linux_mafia	rcconf is just a front-end to update-rc.d isn't it ?
2004-11-20T14:44:00.000Z	linux_mafia	LinuxJones	yes correct, i was just about to say that ;) yeah so manual, or sysv-rc-conf
2004-11-20T14:44:00.000Z	LinuxJones	linux_mafia	:)
2005-01-01T15:11:00.000Z	LinuxJones	linux_mafia	they put the Debian menu back in Hoary ?
2005-01-01T15:12:00.000Z	linux_mafia	LinuxJones	at the moment its there, i assume it will go soon
2005-01-01T15:13:00.000Z	LinuxJones	linux_mafia	there were some problems with X in Hoqry a few days ago, do you know it it has been fixed ?
2005-01-01T15:14:00.000Z	linux_mafia	LinuxJones	i never noticed any problems, so cant say if its been fixed or not
