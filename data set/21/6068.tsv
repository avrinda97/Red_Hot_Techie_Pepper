2007-08-01T07:58:00.000Z	mOrO^	lousygarua	does that mean if I wantted to install Real Player, I need to install it in /bin?
2007-08-01T07:59:00.000Z	lousygarua	mOrO^	nope. i don't think so.
2007-08-01T07:59:00.000Z	lousygarua	mOrO^	i don't think it matters too much
2007-08-01T08:00:00.000Z	mOrO^	lousygarua	Can I just install it in a directroy called /home/moroinstalls?
2007-08-01T08:01:00.000Z	lousygarua	mOrO^	well, yes. doesn't it have an auto-installer?
2007-08-01T08:02:00.000Z	mOrO^	lousygarua	I have to move the bin file into a directory or it will install where it is at. I installed it on my desktop once.
2007-08-01T08:03:00.000Z	mOrO^	lousygarua	I dont know that I have mastered installing bin files.

2007-08-01T08:09:00.000Z	mOrO^	lousygarua	So, when I download a bin file, I put it in the opt directory and then perform the install?
2007-08-01T08:10:00.000Z	lousygarua	mOrO^	hmmm, no. what bin file did  you download? probably an automated install file
2007-08-01T08:10:00.000Z	mOrO^	lousygarua	RealPlayer
2007-08-01T08:11:00.000Z	lousygarua	mOrO^	why don't you follow some install instructions on their site?
2007-08-01T08:12:00.000Z	mOrO^	lousygarua	Man... Ive installed that thing...three or four times. It works, but Firefox wont associate streaming video with it. Totem pops up.
