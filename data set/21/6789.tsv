2007-02-04T14:52:00.000Z	kamui		I had problems with it on my other laptop
2007-02-04T14:53:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	kamui	yup, and sits in the tray
2007-02-04T14:50:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	kamui	do you mean more than one at once?
2007-02-04T14:51:00.000Z	kamui	ConstyXIV	no, I mean so that when she's at work, it connects to the work ap, and when she's at home, it will connect to the home ap
2007-02-04T14:51:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	kamui	sudo apt-get install network-manager network-manager-gnome
2007-02-04T14:52:00.000Z	kamui	ConstyXIV	Ill try that, isn't that the network applet that allows multiple "profiles"
2007-02-04T14:58:00.000Z	kamui	ConstyXIV	how do I launch it?  it doesn't appear in my add to panel options, I remember having to launch it with flags from the command line the first time before too
2007-02-04T14:58:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	kamui	nm-applet
2007-02-04T14:59:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	kamui	it should be in your gnome startup now also
2007-02-04T15:03:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	kamui	no problem
2007-02-04T15:22:00.000Z	kamui	ConstyXIV	not sure why, but network applet wont actually configure the network card :(
2007-02-04T15:22:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	kamui	???
2007-02-04T15:22:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	kamui	have you clicked on it yet?
2007-02-04T15:22:00.000Z	kamui	ConstyXIV	it shows the local networks, but wont' actually establish teh connection to mine, which is hidden and wep protected
2007-02-04T15:23:00.000Z	kamui	ConstyXIV	yea, it SAYS connected but an ifconfig on the device shows otherwise
2007-02-04T15:23:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	kamui	Connect to Other Wireless Network
2007-02-04T15:23:00.000Z	kamui	ConstyXIV	I did, thats how I got my network in the list at all
2007-02-04T15:24:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	kamui	networkmanager also seems to go through its own channels to connect.  see if you have a connection by pinging google or something
2007-02-04T15:24:00.000Z	kamui	ConstyXIV	ifconfig reports no ip address assigned to my wireless card, or rather, the suspect 169._._._ addy
