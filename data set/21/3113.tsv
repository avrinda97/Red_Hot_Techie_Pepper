2010-06-14T00:05:00.000Z	M4d3L1		ext4 or ext3?
2010-06-14T00:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	M4d3L1	for what sort of storage device?
2010-06-14T00:08:00.000Z	M4d3L1	ActionParsnip	OS
2010-06-14T00:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	M4d3L1	no, is it a flash device or a platter based drive?
2012-01-10T23:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	M4d3L1	reinstall
2012-01-10T23:55:00.000Z	M4d3L1	ActionParsnip	its on a dedicated server. and I need to pay to reinstall
2012-01-10T23:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	M4d3L1	reinstall is the only way to get an earlier version
2012-01-10T23:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	M4d3L1	looks easy enough, there is an install script on their site
2012-01-10T23:57:00.000Z	M4d3L1	ActionParsnip	not work on 11.10
2012-01-10T23:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	M4d3L1	what does the script output to say it asn't worked?
2012-01-10T23:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	M4d3L1	wait, isn't virtualmin a plugin for webmin?
2012-01-10T23:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	M4d3L1	webmin is not compatible with ubuntu
2012-01-10T23:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	M4d3L1	so neither is virtualmin
2012-01-11T00:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	M4d3L1	could just use SSH and manage the OS that way, like most people do
2012-01-11T00:03:00.000Z	M4d3L1	ActionParsnip	am not an admin. I need something to quick add account with ftp, mysql db and home folder
2012-01-11T00:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	M4d3L1	its not hard to learn
2012-01-11T00:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	M4d3L1	its as secure as webmin
2012-01-11T00:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	M4d3L1	if you do, if you start work on real servers you won't need pretty GUIs to do your work and your skills will be easily transferrable
2012-01-11T00:06:00.000Z	M4d3L1	ActionParsnip	its not time to learn on a production server too.
2012-01-11T00:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	M4d3L1	well you've taken one on, time to learn
2012-01-11T00:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	M4d3L1	ebox is a supported gui, i suggest you do learn though, maybe in between stuff
