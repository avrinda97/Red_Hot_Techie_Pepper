2008-04-25T22:54:00.000Z	amikrop		Can anyone explain this? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64403/
2008-04-25T22:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	amikrop	please post a description of the problem and not just a link
2008-06-03T18:17:00.000Z	amikrop	Jack_Sparrow	bazhang: Thanks.
2008-06-03T18:19:00.000Z	amikrop	Jack_Sparrow	The thing is that the other computer is networkless.
2008-06-03T18:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	amikrop	I would use aptoncd or copy /var/cache/apt/archives from yours to the new one
2008-06-03T18:20:00.000Z	amikrop	Jack_Sparrow	OK. Thanks.
2008-06-03T18:21:00.000Z	amikrop	Jack_Sparrow	Does `sudo apt-get --purge autoclean` empty /var/cache/apt/archives?
2008-06-03T18:21:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	amikrop	yes
2008-06-03T18:25:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	amikrop	I stand corrected.. autoclean does not, clean does
2008-06-03T18:39:00.000Z	amikrop	Jack_Sparrow	There is nothing I can do to make it work?
2008-06-03T18:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	amikrop	those are a pain, there is a no free $ driver, but I opted to put in a true hardware modem that required no drivers
2008-06-03T18:36:00.000Z	amikrop	Jack_Sparrow	So, what do you recommend me to do?
2008-06-03T18:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	amikrop	up to you.. but I have never been happy with winmodems under linux.. everything went smooth with a real modem that was not simulated with software
2008-06-03T18:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	amikrop	One sec, there may be a free driver with limited speed..
2008-06-03T18:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	amikrop	http://linmodems.technion.ac.il/
2008-06-03T18:43:00.000Z	amikrop	Jack_Sparrow	What driver should I choose from there?
2008-06-03T18:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	amikrop	I cant help you with that.. read the page
2008-06-03T18:43:00.000Z	amikrop	Jack_Sparrow	OK. Thank you.
2008-06-03T18:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	amikrop	It tells you how to figure out your modem type etc
2008-09-19T21:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	amikrop	crossover cable or a switch/router
2008-09-19T21:07:00.000Z	amikrop	Jack_Sparrow	I don't have a switch/router. What is a "crossover cable"?
