2006-05-04T06:43:00.000Z	eck		are shadow passwords turned off by default?
2006-05-04T06:44:00.000Z	kbrooks	eck	uh, maybe. maybe not.
2006-05-04T06:44:00.000Z	eck	kbrooks	i don't have a /etc/shadow, and i see a bunch of random characters in my /etc/passwd in my password field
2006-05-04T06:45:00.000Z	eck	kbrooks	but i did a bootstrap install, so some things on my system are kind of weird
2007-04-13T13:37:00.000Z	eck	kbrooks	sounds good so far :-)
2007-04-13T13:38:00.000Z	kbrooks	eck	^^^
2007-04-13T13:38:00.000Z	kbrooks	eck	Can you help?
2007-04-13T13:39:00.000Z	kbrooks	eck	OK, then why do you think DNS resolving is slow at all?
2007-04-13T13:39:00.000Z	kbrooks	eck	My router is not slow.
2007-04-13T13:41:00.000Z	kbrooks	eck	how should i know?
2007-04-13T13:41:00.000Z	eck	kbrooks	try connecting without the router
2007-04-13T13:42:00.000Z	kbrooks	eck	but what do i use to find out my dns speed ?
2007-04-13T13:42:00.000Z	eck	kbrooks	???? what makes you think dns is slow if you don't know how to find out your dns speed?
2007-04-13T13:43:00.000Z	kbrooks	eck	I want to see if Ubuntu or my router/ISP is slow.
2007-04-13T13:43:00.000Z	eck	kbrooks	what makes you think it is slow right now?
2007-04-13T13:44:00.000Z	kbrooks	eck	hhang on...
2007-04-13T13:44:00.000Z	kbrooks	eck	I don't know. I'm not sure at all.
2007-04-13T13:45:00.000Z	eck	kbrooks	maybe it isn't a dns issue then. if you want to play with it though, you can use the dig command
2007-04-21T05:23:00.000Z	eck	kbrooks	if you just want to grab things off the computer just do places > network
2007-04-30T16:11:00.000Z	eck	kbrooks	have you heard of OIN?
