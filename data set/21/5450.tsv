2008-07-22T02:47:00.000Z	Tonren		I'm getting 'Access point invalid" and "access point not associated" errors when trying to connect to a wireless network with Ubuntu.
2008-07-22T02:47:00.000Z	Tonren		It works on other wifi networks, but there's one particular coffee shop it just won't work with.
2008-07-22T02:48:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Tonren	what type of security is that network?
2008-07-22T02:48:00.000Z	Tonren	Odd-rationale	I'm not sure.  How do I check?
2008-07-22T02:49:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Tonren	"iwlist scanning" should give you more information about available networks...
2008-07-22T02:50:00.000Z	Tonren	Odd-rationale	It says "Encryption key: On" but doesn't indicate WPA or WEP
2008-07-22T02:50:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Tonren	ok. that usually means hex.
2008-07-22T02:51:00.000Z	Tonren	Odd-rationale	"hex"?
2008-07-22T02:51:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Tonren	i mean wep
2008-07-22T02:51:00.000Z	Tonren	Odd-rationale	Hmm, OK.
2008-07-22T02:51:00.000Z	Tonren	Odd-rationale	My home router says that, but it's WPA.  But it has an extra "IE" section.
2008-07-22T02:53:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Tonren	if the encryption is on, and it doesn't speicify wpa, then it usually means it is wep.
2008-07-22T02:53:00.000Z	Tonren	Odd-rationale	Makes sense
2008-07-22T02:57:00.000Z	Tonren	Odd-rationale	I manually entered the key with iwconfig key, but it's still not working.
2008-07-22T02:57:00.000Z	Tonren	Odd-rationale	Should I turn off NetworkManager first?
2008-07-22T03:02:00.000Z	Tonren	Odd-rationale	How do I know if I need s: or not at the beginning of the key?
2008-07-22T03:03:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Tonren	not sure. sorry. the forum post should tell...
2008-07-22T03:03:00.000Z	Tonren	Odd-rationale	It doesn't.  :-(
2008-07-22T03:03:00.000Z	Tonren	Odd-rationale	It just says that you need s: if it's ASCII, but not if it's Hex.  How do I know...? The key I have is just numbers.
2008-07-22T03:04:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Tonren	umm. try both... :|
2008-07-22T03:17:00.000Z	Tonren	Odd-rationale	Thanks, for some reason that worked.  I thought I'd done all of that before.  ;-P  Thanks again!
