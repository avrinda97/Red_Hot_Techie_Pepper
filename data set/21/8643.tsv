2006-11-09T08:58:00.000Z	Mantice	Xenguy	I hope it fixes my azureus and my Beryl problem.
2006-11-09T08:58:00.000Z	Xenguy	Mantice	good luck - I haven't bothered to try yet for some reason
2006-11-09T08:59:00.000Z	Mantice	Xenguy	I saw a whole bunch of Beryl effects in Ubuntu and I thought that I could live with a couple of games in linux just for the eye candy.
