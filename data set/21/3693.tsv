2008-10-28T04:58:00.000Z	jkoce	frogscott	what type of videos are you playing
2008-10-28T04:58:00.000Z	frogscott	jkoce	you tube
2008-10-28T04:59:00.000Z	jkoce	frogscott	rgr that, i couldn't play them either without installing java (the full version from sun, not the open source plugin)
2008-10-28T05:00:00.000Z	frogscott	jkoce	the full tar?
2008-10-28T05:01:00.000Z	jkoce	frogscott	i used the addons manager in firefox to do it.  if you go to firefox what addons are listed?
2008-10-28T05:02:00.000Z	jkoce	frogscott	click on plugins, and see which java is listed
2008-10-28T05:02:00.000Z	jkoce	frogscott	mine says java plugin 1.6.0_07
2008-10-28T05:02:00.000Z	frogscott	jkoce	installing
2008-10-28T05:04:00.000Z	frogscott	jkoce	yes because uve only used linux 5 days
2008-10-28T05:07:00.000Z	frogscott	jkoce	install envyng
2008-10-28T05:08:00.000Z	jkoce	frogscott	i did that...what do i do next?  if i reboot with the nvidia card it just shows a cursor - no desktop
2008-10-28T05:08:00.000Z	jkoce	frogscott	i think if i could get into the command line or desktop then i could use envy, but i can't get that far
2008-10-28T05:09:00.000Z	frogscott	jkoce	sweet.....you cant use envy from menu/system tools in icon menu on desktop?
2008-10-28T05:09:00.000Z	jkoce	frogscott	only if i boot with the integrated gfx card
2008-10-28T05:10:00.000Z	frogscott	jkoce	boot with the integrated card then and let envy find your drivers
2008-10-28T05:11:00.000Z	jkoce	frogscott	it says nvidia card not detected - cuz it's not installed at the moment.  should i install it and boot with the igp card, and then try to detect?
2008-10-28T05:12:00.000Z	frogscott	jkoce	yes install it then boot in whatever mode u can to get desktop then go to envy console and set it up
2008-10-28T05:13:00.000Z	jkoce	frogscott	ok i'll give it a try.  back in a few.  did the java plug in work?
2008-10-28T05:14:00.000Z	frogscott	jkoce	hmm in the synaptic manger or in firefox?
2008-10-28T05:24:00.000Z	frogscott	jkoce	whats up?
