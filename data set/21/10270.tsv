2005-06-30T07:17:00.000Z	fidget		hello ... I managed to screw up my fstab file ... what exactly should this file contain?
2005-06-30T07:18:00.000Z	fidget		I did not
2005-06-30T07:18:00.000Z	fidget		is it the same for all computers?
2005-06-30T07:18:00.000Z	fidget		how would I go about creating one for my own computer then .....
2005-06-30T07:18:00.000Z	fidget		isn't it mount points?
2005-06-30T07:19:00.000Z	fidget		ah ok ... I'll google it ....
2005-06-30T07:19:00.000Z	fidget		thanks
2005-06-30T07:19:00.000Z	fidget		what all is in it?
2005-06-30T07:19:00.000Z	fidget		just harddrive ... cd drives?
2005-06-30T07:20:00.000Z	roger	fidget	have a look at http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?part=1&chap=8  :)
2005-06-30T07:20:00.000Z	roger	fidget	but ubuntu should have created it automatically for you
2005-06-30T07:21:00.000Z	roger	fidget	lol :)
2005-06-30T07:25:00.000Z	roger	fidget	type "whatis cat"
2005-06-30T07:26:00.000Z	roger	fidget	type "mount" and it should have most of your current information which you can copy out into a new fstab
2005-06-30T07:28:00.000Z	roger	fidget	does typing "mount" come up with a load of stuff?
2005-06-30T07:29:00.000Z	roger	fidget	yeah, then if it is broken you can boot off the livecd and fix it
2005-06-30T07:30:00.000Z	roger	fidget	no worries, the main ones you need to boot are (if you did a default partitioning) proc, your root, and swap space
2005-06-30T07:31:00.000Z	roger	fidget	proc will always be: proc            /proc           proc    defaults        0       0
2005-06-30T07:31:00.000Z	roger	fidget	and your root and swap you can get from the output of 'mount'
2005-06-30T07:33:00.000Z	roger	fidget	actually no... to check your swap partition type "cat /proc/swaps" and it will show your swap device there
2005-06-30T07:41:00.000Z	roger	fidget	good luck :)
