2012-02-07T08:51:00.000Z	invisiblek	fellayaboy	you probably would want something more like a NAT instead of VPN for that situation

2012-02-07T08:51:00.000Z	fellayaboy		can a tun0 connection do something like that to this thing?
2012-02-07T08:52:00.000Z	invisiblek	fellayaboy	i really don't think you want to use a vpn here (which is what tun would be used for)
