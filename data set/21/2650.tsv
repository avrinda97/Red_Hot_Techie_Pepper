2009-08-05T04:47:00.000Z	arifd86		i'm running eeebuntu right now... the lxde beta
2009-08-05T04:47:00.000Z	arifd86		guys, I'm running a really bare version of ubuntu, what's the apt-get name for the program called sessions (that deals with startup commands)?
2009-08-05T04:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arifd86	 normally the window manager/desktops have their own session-manager type tools/system
2009-08-05T04:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arifd86	 and what window manager/desktop are you using?
2009-08-05T04:49:00.000Z	arifd86	Dr_Willis	lxde
2009-08-05T04:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arifd86	 check the lxde docs to see what sort of auto-starting/sessin stuff it follows. it Might use the 'Autostart' directory.
2009-08-05T04:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arifd86	 lxde uses some sort of lxsession from what i am seeing on google.
2009-08-05T04:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arifd86	 but it seems lxde.org is down at this time
2009-08-05T04:56:00.000Z	arifd86	Dr_Willis	lxde.org has been down for atleast a week
2009-08-05T04:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arifd86	  see what lxde docs are instaled and theck theubuntu wiki pages and stuff.. To be honest.. lxde is just not that popular.. or commonly used
2009-08-05T04:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arifd86	 could try lxsession --help or silimer also..
2009-08-05T04:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arifd86	 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LXDE     LXSession, session manager
2009-08-05T04:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arifd86	 its very likely lxde uses some alternative methiod.. not the niormal ubntu/gnome method.
2009-08-05T04:59:00.000Z	arifd86	Dr_Willis	doesn't startup stuff get handled by debian/ubuntu, not the window manager itself?
2009-08-05T05:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arifd86	 it gets handled by the WINDOW MANAGER/Desktop
2009-08-05T05:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arifd86	 i said that earlier
2009-08-05T05:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arifd86	 its all about layers.. You are thinking at the 'what the user is starting layer'  X starts up.. does stuff.. launches the window manager the User selected  Then its all up to the window manager.. No longer the 'system'
2009-08-05T05:05:00.000Z	arifd86	Dr_Willis	thanks, I just had it figured that the window manager was nothing more than the GUI to the system
2009-08-05T05:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arifd86	 the 'window manager' is techinally the tool that does the window decorations. thats true.. but you are running the lxde 'desktop' that is the Window manager + other tools...
2009-08-05T05:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arifd86	  its like legos. :) parts all working together.
2009-08-05T05:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arifd86	  part of the lxde desktop is the 'lxsession' program that handles the session management..
