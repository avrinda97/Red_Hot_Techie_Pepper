2011-06-11T17:41:00.000Z	julie	grmrgecko	please give us the errors you get with both lilo and grub...  BTW since when is a bios provided to lilo?
2011-06-11T17:41:00.000Z	grmrgecko	julie	It says something about newer bios
2011-06-11T17:45:00.000Z	grmrgecko	julie	Unable to install GRUB in /dev/sda
2011-06-11T17:45:00.000Z	julie	grmrgecko	does it give anything else?
2011-06-11T17:46:00.000Z	julie	grmrgecko	let us know once you've completed the install so we can check your boot options
2011-06-11T18:20:00.000Z	grmrgecko	julie	Here is the full error. Configuring grub-pc unable to install grub in /dev/sda executing grub-install /dev/sda failded.
2011-06-11T18:21:00.000Z	julie	grmrgecko	that's it?
2011-06-11T18:21:00.000Z	julie	grmrgecko	and what does lilo give you?
2011-06-11T18:22:00.000Z	grmrgecko	julie	Does lilo work with booting windows?
2011-06-11T18:22:00.000Z	julie	grmrgecko	it is included in the default config
2011-06-11T18:25:00.000Z	julie	grmrgecko	where did you get that?  booting?
2011-06-11T18:26:00.000Z	grmrgecko	julie	I think it's confused
2011-06-11T18:28:00.000Z	julie	grmrgecko	give me your lilo.conf on pastebin please
2011-06-11T18:29:00.000Z	grmrgecko	julie	how?
2011-06-11T18:30:00.000Z	grmrgecko	julie	I mean how do I get to it
2011-06-11T18:31:00.000Z	julie	grmrgecko	ok, check your lilo.conf to see if it contains any reference to sdb and change it to sda
2011-06-11T18:31:00.000Z	grmrgecko	julie	Where is it:P
2011-06-11T18:31:00.000Z	julie	grmrgecko	/etc/lilo.conf
2011-06-11T18:32:00.000Z	julie	grmrgecko	yes do that
2011-06-11T18:33:00.000Z	julie	grmrgecko	I'm not sure I would have followed this approach if I had known that you didn't even have a lilo.conf file...  why did you say it wasn't working if it was simply not configured^
2011-06-11T18:36:00.000Z	julie	grmrgecko	start with /etc/lilo.conf.example
