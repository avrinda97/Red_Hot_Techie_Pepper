2007-08-30T13:15:00.000Z	funbitz		hi, could anyone spare some time to guide me what performance tweaks (graphics effects disabling, unnecessary processes that can spare ram, etc...) could i do to make my life easier with a 866 PIII 512RAM ?? thanks
2007-08-30T13:16:00.000Z	funbitz		i just installed ubuntu 7.04 and updated it.. so default i guess
2007-08-30T13:16:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	funbitz	try running xubuntu
2007-08-30T13:17:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	funbitz	window manager uses less I think
2007-08-30T13:17:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	funbitz	you just have to install a couple packages I think
2007-08-30T13:17:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	funbitz	it should be fairly easy...
2007-08-30T13:17:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey		!xubuntu | funbitz
2007-08-30T13:17:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey		hmm..
2007-08-30T13:17:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	funbitz	that should help a bit.
2007-08-30T13:18:00.000Z	funbitz	d4rkmonkey	thanks a lot. i'm gonna try that
2007-08-30T13:19:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	funbitz	I know I have a link somewhere for optimising Open Office, if you want I can search for it
2007-08-30T13:19:00.000Z	funbitz	d4rkmonkey	if you're so kind. i'm obsessed about performance :)
2007-08-30T13:20:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	funbitz	I have nothing better to do at 3:20 AM anyways :)
2007-08-30T13:20:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	funbitz	just give me a bit to find the link, I forget what I did with it
2007-08-30T13:20:00.000Z	funbitz	d4rkmonkey	ok
