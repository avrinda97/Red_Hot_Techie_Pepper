2009-02-17T18:28:00.000Z	travian_geek		is there a commando for listing information about other computers in a LAN? Like ip dns osv
2009-02-17T18:30:00.000Z	bernz	travian_geek	not exactly, but you probably want some sort of security tool which can ping a sequence of IPs
2009-02-17T18:30:00.000Z	bernz	travian_geek	basically, ping each machine number in turn in your subnet -- but beware, machines can choose not to respond to ping (or other ICMP) for many reasons, some trivial/stupid
2009-02-17T18:31:00.000Z	travian_geek	bernz	how do I ping an IP i dont know?
2009-02-17T18:32:00.000Z	bernz	travian_geek	that's the point -- you need to hope that however the network was originally configured, either most members use DHCP (and so you can too, to find out the gateway), or you need a hint for the subnet (very typically 192.168.1.x for home LANs)
2009-02-17T18:33:00.000Z	bernz	travian_geek	and once you have that, you ping 192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.2, ... for that whole subnet
2009-02-17T18:33:00.000Z	travian_geek	bernz	o shit:P thats gooing to take ages!
2009-02-17T18:33:00.000Z	bernz	travian_geek	if you have no starting point, you'll have to go for more low-level approach, like traffic sniffing -- install 'wireshark' on a working box that can join the LAN you want to work on
2009-02-17T18:34:00.000Z	bernz	travian_geek	actually, if the subnet is smallish, it's surprisingly fast, because a ping/pong sequence only takes milliseconds, or a second at most to be considered a timeout (for local)
2009-02-17T18:35:00.000Z	bernz	travian_geek	wireshark is a network traffic analyzer (AKA "sniffer") which will let you inspect the data on your LAN in a pretty raw way, but with nice filters to make sense of it too
2009-02-17T18:36:00.000Z	travian_geek	bernz	how do i start it?
2009-02-17T18:36:00.000Z	bernz	travian_geek	with it, you might be able to notice stuff like ARP packets which are basically asking "hey, is this address in use?  can i use this? can someone else hear me?" (not exactly like DHCP, but similar)
2009-02-17T18:36:00.000Z	bernz	travian_geek	probably something like 'sudo apt-get install wireshark' from a command prompt (CLI)
2009-02-17T18:37:00.000Z	bernz	travian_geek	and then it'll be available under your 'applications' menu on the desktop, or from the CLI, you can probably just type 'wireshark'
2009-02-17T18:37:00.000Z	travian_geek	bernz	is it GUI?
2009-02-17T18:37:00.000Z	bernz	travian_geek	yep, it's gui-oriented (though the libs it uses could allow usage from text-mode/terminal/headless/API-only-access)
2009-02-17T18:38:00.000Z	travian_geek	bernz	wireshark in CLI just gives me: Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display:
2009-02-17T18:39:00.000Z	bernz	travian_geek	if you have the luxury of a spare router, and a laptop on which you can run wireshark, connect only the router to your laptop via one of the "client" ports on the router (1, 2, 3, ... -- not WLAN)
2009-02-17T18:39:00.000Z	bernz	travian_geek	you might need to launch it from the desktop/GUI then
2009-02-17T18:40:00.000Z	bernz	travian_geek	if you have just a PC connected as a LAN client on the router, you'll eliminate "noise" of real network traffic; then, try a bit of stuff (ping, etc) and observe to learn; once you're familiar with wireshark, use it on the mystery LAN you're trying to document
2009-02-17T18:40:00.000Z	travian_geek	bernz	I have a spare router! :P But I cant find the program in my menys! and I cant start it through CLI
