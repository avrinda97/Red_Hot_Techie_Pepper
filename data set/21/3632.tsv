2010-03-16T14:24:00.000Z	Gnea	rajkumar	stable, LTR releases are not production ready?
2010-03-16T14:25:00.000Z	rajkumar	Gnea	LTR is just marketing nonsense.
2010-03-16T14:25:00.000Z	Gnea	rajkumar	what's your point?
2010-03-16T14:25:00.000Z	rajkumar	Gnea	My point is Ubuntu is not ready for serious usage.
2010-03-16T14:26:00.000Z	Gnea	rajkumar	in what capacity?
2010-03-16T14:26:00.000Z	rajkumar	Gnea	Do you want me to beat drumroll ?
2010-03-16T14:26:00.000Z	Gnea	rajkumar	pardon?
2010-03-16T14:26:00.000Z	rajkumar	Gnea	Quality of releases and support tools.
2010-03-16T14:27:00.000Z	Gnea	rajkumar	you say it's not ready for serious usage. serious usage by who?
2010-03-16T14:27:00.000Z	rajkumar	Gnea	Citation needed.
2010-03-16T14:27:00.000Z	Gnea	rajkumar	I'm asking YOU.
2010-03-16T14:27:00.000Z	rajkumar	Gnea	Wrong reply.
2010-03-16T14:27:00.000Z	Gnea	rajkumar	yes, your reply is incorrect.
2010-03-16T14:28:00.000Z	Gnea	rajkumar	I asked you a simple, straight-forward question: WHO is not ready to use Ubuntu seriously?
2010-03-16T14:30:00.000Z	Gnea	rajkumar	the support of Ubuntu is not the same as it is for other commercial products. You're trying to fit a square into a circle, it doesn't work like that.
2010-03-16T14:35:00.000Z	Gnea	rajkumar	I find it extremely difficult to believe that a company with even a semi-competant IT team can't figure out a way to maintain changes internally in a cost-effective manner.
2010-03-16T14:36:00.000Z	rajkumar	Gnea	Wow!!!
2010-03-16T14:36:00.000Z	Gnea	rajkumar	hrm?
2010-03-16T14:37:00.000Z	Gnea	rajkumar	you're entitled to your opinion, even if it's wrong.
2010-03-16T14:37:00.000Z	rajkumar	Gnea	we will see.
2010-03-16T14:38:00.000Z	Gnea	rajkumar	what leads you believe that it's going to crash and burn instead of thrive?
