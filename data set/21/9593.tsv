2005-08-25T08:22:00.000Z	sneezymarble		I'm trying to install "nvidia-glx" through synaptic and before the file even downloads a dialogue pops up asking me to put the Ubunutu Installation CD in the drive.  I do, then press "ok" and nothing happens....any ideas?...
2005-08-25T08:23:00.000Z	brenner	sneezymarble	it's using your CD as a repo...bets to disable it and just use net repos
2005-08-25T08:25:00.000Z	sneezymarble	brenner	 I'm sorry if this is an inane question...but, how do I do what you have suggested?
2005-08-25T08:25:00.000Z	brenner	sneezymarble	do you know how to use synaptic/apt-get ?
2005-08-25T08:26:00.000Z	sneezymarble	brenner	 not really
2005-08-25T08:26:00.000Z	brenner	sneezymarble	sys > admin > synaptic
2005-08-25T08:27:00.000Z	sneezymarble	brenner	 I understand if you don't want to explain it.  I believe I saw a tuturial on apt-get in the wiki.
2005-08-25T08:27:00.000Z	brenner	sneezymarble	no, no biggie.....the wiki probably would explain it better anyway :)
2005-08-25T08:28:00.000Z	sneezymarble	brenner	 thank you though
2005-08-25T08:28:00.000Z	brenner	sneezymarble	but what you're doing is very easy, i can walk you through
2005-08-25T08:28:00.000Z	brenner	sneezymarble	open a terminal
2005-08-25T08:28:00.000Z	brenner	sneezymarble	sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
2005-08-25T08:28:00.000Z	brenner	sneezymarble	type that
2005-08-25T08:29:00.000Z	brenner	sneezymarble	did a file open up?
2005-08-25T08:29:00.000Z	brenner	sneezymarble	see the top line.... it should have CD there somewhere
2005-08-25T08:30:00.000Z	brenner	sneezymarble	comment it out by putting a # character at the start of the line
2005-08-25T08:30:00.000Z	brenner	sneezymarble	you might want to enable universe and multiverse while you're at it
2005-08-25T08:31:00.000Z	brenner	sneezymarble	yep, you can do that by removing the # character at the start of these two lines:
2005-08-25T08:32:00.000Z	sneezymarble	brenner	 thank you very much
2005-08-25T08:32:00.000Z	brenner	sneezymarble	no probs, save and close
2005-08-25T08:32:00.000Z	brenner	sneezymarble	then type: sudo apt-get update
