2011-02-12T06:28:00.000Z	dpb_		Hi all, I am getting a error: couldn't call CWAP(1) when booting into a clean install of ubuntu 10.10 on a USB drive (booting via grub4dos and then plop), the system continues to boot after this and gets to the login screen, but when i login it freezes/hangs at the end of the login drum sound. I have tried editing the grub switches acpi=off and apm=off with no luck.
