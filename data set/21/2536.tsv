2009-09-24T02:50:00.000Z	zebastian		where do i set what shows up on the trayÂ¿?
2009-09-24T02:52:00.000Z	VCoolio	zebastian	? what is on the system tray is up to the applications
2009-09-24T02:52:00.000Z	VCoolio	zebastian	what do you want to add / remove?
2009-09-24T02:53:00.000Z	VCoolio	zebastian	I can see that; search the opera preferences for that; I don't know; there is no ubuntu setting for that kind of things, the apps use or don't use the systray
2009-12-07T03:56:00.000Z	VCoolio	zebastian	check if gnome-settings-daemon is running, you need to disable it to start at startup
2009-12-07T03:57:00.000Z	VCoolio	zebastian	or maybe nautilus is hitchhiking your desktop, and it was activated to show your usb-device; in gnome nautilus draws the desktop
2009-12-07T03:57:00.000Z	zebastian	VCoolio	arghh2d2 i got the following message when i tried to change wallpaper by right clicking on the desktop http://pastebin.com/m26e43077
2009-12-07T03:58:00.000Z	VCoolio	zebastian	that's ok, killall nautilus and lxde desktop should be back
2009-12-07T03:59:00.000Z	VCoolio	zebastian	no sudo needed
2009-12-07T03:59:00.000Z	zebastian	VCoolio	nautilus: no process killed
2009-12-07T04:00:00.000Z	VCoolio	zebastian	do "ps -ef | grep -i nautilus" and see if it's running, make note of the first number, that's the pid, then "kill -9 <pid here>"
2009-12-07T04:01:00.000Z	VCoolio	zebastian	or run "xkill" then click the desktop that is not your lxde desktop, see what happens
2009-12-07T04:01:00.000Z	zebastian	VCoolio	ok just did that killed nautilus but again, what happens is the wallpaper is still the one i use on gnome minus the icons
2009-12-07T04:02:00.000Z	VCoolio	zebastian	if it's not nautilus or gnome-settings-daemon I don't know anymore
2009-12-07T04:02:00.000Z	zebastian	VCoolio	if i right click on the desktop tht's left without icons nothing happens
2009-12-07T04:06:00.000Z	VCoolio	zebastian	ok; apparently lxde uses pcmanfm by default; I suspect it drew over the existing desktop and that one is still there too; you'll see if you logout; doesn't matter much
2009-12-07T04:07:00.000Z	zebastian	VCoolio	cann you say that again only end userish
2009-12-07T04:08:00.000Z	VCoolio	zebastian	like nautilus in gnome, I think pcmanfm manages your desktop with icons and stuff in lxde; but I thing it drew your lxde desktop stuff on top of the one you just had and which you didn't want; it doesn't matter, but when you logout you may notice that other one for a short moment too; that's as end-userish as I can get ;)
2009-12-07T04:09:00.000Z	zebastian	VCoolio	thank you
2009-12-07T04:16:00.000Z	zebastian	VCoolio	is this related http://blog.lxde.org/?p=352 you think?
2009-12-07T04:18:00.000Z	VCoolio	zebastian	hmm, could be, it's about volume management; thx for the link, I'm having some issues there too (with an other de, but still)
