2006-12-14T06:09:00.000Z	VSpike		I was thinking, since moving from Windows, I've often been less than impressed by the quality of application software available in Ubuntu (bought to mind as yet another app failed the first time I tried to use it).  One thing I love about Linux is the command line - the Bash shell and all the good stuff that goes with it (awk, sed, grep, etc.).  However, I could have all that stuff on Windows with Cygwin...
2006-12-14T06:09:00.000Z	VSpike		My question is, what is your killer app on ubuntu/Linux?  Which app do you find really indispensible?
2006-12-14T06:10:00.000Z	jrib	VSpike	vim, but this is a question for #ubuntu-offtopic
2006-12-14T06:10:00.000Z	VSpike	jrib	yeah, I did wonder. It's kind of a support question, and kind of not, but I'll take it over there
2006-12-14T06:10:00.000Z	VSpike	jrib	I like vim too, although I don't really use it to its potential
2007-04-17T05:46:00.000Z	jrib	VSpike	dpkg -L
2007-04-19T16:40:00.000Z	jrib	VSpike	ext3 doesn't keep track of creation date
2007-04-19T16:40:00.000Z	VSpike	jrib	okay, thanks

2008-01-10T19:50:00.000Z	jrib	VSpike	check if they are in the "controls" or "window border" tabs after you press the "customize..." button
2008-01-10T19:52:00.000Z	VSpike	jrib	ahh yes indeed
2008-01-10T19:52:00.000Z	VSpike	jrib	thanks
2008-01-11T19:23:00.000Z	jrib	VSpike	have you checked out mail-notification?
2008-01-11T19:26:00.000Z	VSpike	jrib	i havent .. thanks for the pointer
2008-01-11T19:32:00.000Z	VSpike	jrib	it doesn't seem to be able to check multiple folders :./
2008-01-11T19:33:00.000Z	jrib	VSpike	yeah, you're right.  I assumed you could add more than one mailbox and specify the path but does not seem so
2008-01-11T19:34:00.000Z	VSpike	jrib	in some ways, the logical thing might be to have maildrop call a notification tool
2008-01-11T19:35:00.000Z	VSpike	jrib	but I'm not sure how it would communicate with a running user session
2008-01-11T19:36:00.000Z	VSpike	jrib	it's annoying because t-bird scans all folders for new mail, and shows a brief popup, but has no tray icon.  Yet t-bird for windows does.
2009-08-04T15:45:00.000Z	jrib	VSpike	I wonder if theer is an cli version of $app with vim bindings...
2009-08-04T15:46:00.000Z	VSpike	jrib	:)
