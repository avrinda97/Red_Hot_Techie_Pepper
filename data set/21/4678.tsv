2008-03-03T20:56:00.000Z	antilpn		some one know if it is possible to: ssh -R 21:*:21 user@host ?
2008-03-03T20:57:00.000Z	joeytwiddle	antilpn	my man page says yes
2008-03-03T20:57:00.000Z	antilpn	joeytwiddle	are you shoure the "*" is workin
2008-03-03T20:58:00.000Z	joeytwiddle		no0tic, sorry antilpn, my manpage says something different from what i thought i read
2008-03-03T20:58:00.000Z	joeytwiddle		oh damn nick completion!
2008-03-03T20:58:00.000Z	antilpn	joeytwiddle	ok
2008-03-03T20:59:00.000Z	joeytwiddle		it says you can use "*" in the bind_address, but nothing about the host =/
2008-03-03T20:59:00.000Z	joeytwiddle		the problem is with your "*", how will it know which host to connect to?!
2008-03-03T21:00:00.000Z	joeytwiddle	antilpn	maybe you just want -R 21:localhost:21
2008-03-03T21:00:00.000Z	antilpn	joeytwiddle	a remote forward at the momen i can only get it to 127.0.0.1 an then no other computer in the network can connect
2008-03-03T21:02:00.000Z	joeytwiddle	antilpn	what do you actually want to do?
2008-03-03T21:02:00.000Z	joeytwiddle		ssh can only forward ports, it can't make a virtual network for you ;)
2008-03-03T21:04:00.000Z	joeytwiddle		sry i don't know, it was just an idea ;)
2008-03-03T21:05:00.000Z	antilpn	joeytwiddle	ftpserver that canÂ´t have incoming-c -> router (whith ssh -r) -> and a client connect to this port that is forwarded to router
2008-03-03T21:05:00.000Z	joeytwiddle	antilpn	and you say it works, but only once?
2008-03-03T21:05:00.000Z	joeytwiddle		i tried port-forwarding ftp once, but got very stuck
2008-03-03T21:05:00.000Z	joeytwiddle		apparently ftp likes to open up other ports!
2008-03-03T21:05:00.000Z	joeytwiddle		(unless you use it in a certain mode)
2008-03-03T21:06:00.000Z	antilpn	joeytwiddle	no i can only forward to the routers 127.0.0.1:21 and then i cant connect from other computers
2008-03-03T21:07:00.000Z	joeytwiddle		i fear you won't manage it with port forwarding, unless you forward *all* ports FTP might use
2008-03-03T21:07:00.000Z	antilpn	joeytwiddle	ok
