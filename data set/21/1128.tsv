2011-01-27T19:06:00.000Z	raipe		Good evening!
2011-01-27T19:07:00.000Z	raipe		I have problems with mysql
2011-01-27T19:07:00.000Z	raipe		the process is running but I can't access mysql
2011-01-27T19:09:00.000Z	sipior	raipe	how are you trying to access it? is it configured to permit the connection that you are attempting?
2011-01-27T19:11:00.000Z	raipe	sipior	what ever I try I get an error: initializing configdb from scratch...ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: NO) ERROR"
2011-01-27T19:12:00.000Z	sipior	raipe	interesting. new install of mysql?
2011-01-27T19:12:00.000Z	sipior	raipe	also, which version of ubuntu, and which version of the package?
2011-01-27T19:16:00.000Z	sipior	raipe	what was the exact command line used?
2011-01-27T19:18:00.000Z	raipe	sipior	/opt/open-xchange/sbin/initconfigdb --configdb-pass=db_passoword -a
2011-01-27T19:18:00.000Z	sipior	raipe	see here: http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-1257582.html
2011-01-27T19:20:00.000Z	raipe	sipior	mysql --user=root --password=yourPassword gives me an error
2011-01-27T19:21:00.000Z	sipior	raipe	"yourPassword" is not to be used literally.
2011-01-27T19:21:00.000Z	raipe	sipior	what ever I put there I get the same error
2011-01-27T19:22:00.000Z	sipior	raipe	then contact the maintainer of the installer you're using, and tell them to fix their broken program.
2011-01-27T19:27:00.000Z	raipe	sipior	The point is that I would like to access mysql as a root
2011-01-27T19:27:00.000Z	raipe	sipior	but I'm not successful on that
2011-01-27T19:28:00.000Z	sipior	raipe	it's possible you've forgotten the root mysql password you established at installation. try a "sudo dpkf-reconfigure mysql" and configure as desired.
2011-01-27T19:29:00.000Z	raipe	sipior	command not found
2011-01-27T19:30:00.000Z	raipe	sipior	"dpkf-reconfigure: command not found"
2011-01-27T19:30:00.000Z	sipior	raipe	that should be "dpkg", not "dpkf" (but i imagine you could've figured that out on your own)
2011-01-27T19:30:00.000Z	raipe	sipior	that's true
