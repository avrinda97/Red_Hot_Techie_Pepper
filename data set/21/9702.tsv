2005-10-22T14:41:00.000Z	sbartleylinux		It seems that xdm is not accessing the /etc/X11/xdm directory config files at all.  It is starting or at least trying to start but the echo statments I put into the config files are never getting accessed.  Anyone with any ideas on where to start troubleshooting?
2005-10-22T14:42:00.000Z	sbartleylinux		nothing that gives indication of problem that i can find.
2005-10-22T14:43:00.000Z	sbartleylinux		np
2005-10-22T14:44:00.000Z	crimsun	sbartleylinux	do you mean xdm starts and awaits user input, or do you mean it starts but seems to exit?
2005-10-22T14:45:00.000Z	sbartleylinux	crimsun	starts but runs in background.  never gives login and just drops back to text environment.  ps -ef shows process still running but nothing else.
2005-10-22T14:46:00.000Z	sbartleylinux	crimsun	if I set default to gdm, works fine.  only when set to xdm does it do this.
2005-10-22T14:47:00.000Z	crimsun	sbartleylinux	sounds like a missing lib. What do the log files tell you?
2005-10-22T14:48:00.000Z	sbartleylinux	crimsun	any pointer on which log file I should focus on?
2005-10-22T14:49:00.000Z	crimsun	sbartleylinux	auth.log?
2005-10-22T14:49:00.000Z	crimsun	sbartleylinux	daemon.log?
2005-10-22T14:55:00.000Z	sbartleylinux	crimsun	neither of those logs show anything that would indicate a problem to me.
2005-10-22T14:55:00.000Z	crimsun	sbartleylinux	did you try dpkg-reconfigure xdm ?
2005-10-22T14:56:00.000Z	sbartleylinux	crimsun	yes.
2005-10-22T15:05:00.000Z	sbartleylinux	crimsun	any other ideas?
2005-10-22T15:05:00.000Z	sbartleylinux	crimsun	or any idea of who might have the knowledge needed?
2005-10-22T15:06:00.000Z	crimsun	sbartleylinux	not off the top of my head. You could ask daniels, but he might be busy.
2005-10-22T15:06:00.000Z	sbartleylinux	crimsun	k. thx.
2005-10-22T15:07:00.000Z	sbartleylinux	crimsun	daniels or danielg?
2005-10-22T15:07:00.000Z	sbartleylinux	crimsun	dont see a daniels on here.
2005-10-22T15:08:00.000Z	crimsun	sbartleylinux	so he's asleep/busy atm
2005-10-22T15:08:00.000Z	sbartleylinux	crimsun	k. thx.
