2006-11-07T17:19:00.000Z	highneko		Who's installing the flash plugin? Why not get it from the adobe site?
2006-11-07T06:43:00.000Z	highneko		Hello. I just had a problem when starting doom3-demo. I messed it up somehow, my screen resolution changed and I couldn't exit the game after it wasn't working. I ended up rebooting using a ctrl+alt+f1 terminal thing. How could I have exited the game without a restart?
2006-11-07T06:44:00.000Z	chuckyp	highneko	gone to terminal 1 like you did and killed theprocess
2006-11-07T06:44:00.000Z	chuckyp	highneko	killall doom3-demo
2006-11-07T06:44:00.000Z	highneko	chuckyp	Exactly what I tryed.
2006-11-07T06:45:00.000Z	chuckyp	highneko	wellt hat would have done it.  Or you can kill by pid  i.e. ps aux | grep doom3  get the pid and kill 12345123  or whatever it is.
2006-11-07T06:45:00.000Z	highneko	chuckyp	That process sisn't exist, so I did a "ps -e | grep doom" and I found it and killed it, but when I did a alt+ctrl+f7, It wouldn't work.
2006-11-07T06:45:00.000Z	chuckyp	highneko	then I would restart X sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
2006-11-07T06:45:00.000Z	chuckyp	highneko	yeah then you would just need to restart X
2006-11-07T06:46:00.000Z	highneko	chuckyp	I found a process callled doom3.x86 or something, and killed it. Shouldn't alt+ctrl+f7 have went back to my desktop? I saw a cursor but it wouldn't even move.
2006-11-07T06:47:00.000Z	highneko	chuckyp	I had the demo working ok before. I'm afraid to try and fix it now.
2006-11-07T06:48:00.000Z	chuckyp	highneko	yes it would but if the resolution was all messed up you would have had to restart X to get it back.  hence the sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
2006-11-07T06:48:00.000Z	highneko	chuckyp	Ah, interesting. Would I lose my unsaved data?
2006-11-07T06:49:00.000Z	chuckyp	highneko	yes most likely
2006-11-07T06:49:00.000Z	highneko	chuckyp	Wouldn't ctrl+alt+backsace have the same effect?
2006-11-07T06:50:00.000Z	chuckyp	highneko	yes unless X is completely frozen then you would have to do it the way I mentioned
2006-11-07T06:50:00.000Z	highneko	chuckyp	A backup plan is always nice. Thank you.
2006-11-07T06:50:00.000Z	chuckyp	highneko	there is also xkill where you can just click on an app to kill it.
2006-11-07T06:50:00.000Z	chuckyp	highneko	if you hit alt+f2 to get a run prompt   then just type xkill
2006-11-07T06:50:00.000Z	chuckyp	highneko	or make a keyboard shortcut for it.
