What would you do if you spent 3 full days and nights looking for help on the issue and not finding it? what would you do? what would you do when your computer is unuseable for 3 days and you don't want to suffer windows again? I need to know.

2012-07-13T19:39:00.000Z	ClientAlive	Bronze	I can't get it to work. There's a lot to this story but I won't bother you to try to explain it all here. Suffice it to say I have done quite a bit of troubleshooting and believe I have narrowed things down. I'm on the last leg of the race and not sure how to get past this last hurdle.
