2010-04-06T02:23:00.000Z	Ek|mu5		man... getting Linux to work smoothly on new hardware is a pain...
2010-04-06T02:24:00.000Z	histo	Ek|mu5	not really
2010-04-06T02:25:00.000Z	Ek|mu5	histo	on a Toshiba Portege m900 with the Core i3 and nvidia g310m GPU, it is...
2010-04-06T02:26:00.000Z	histo	Ek|mu5	what problem are you having?
2010-04-06T02:27:00.000Z	Ek|mu5	histo	screen flickering on the new kernel, something to do with the brightness. This is not an issue on a patched lenny stable kernel even with nvidia drivers (but I don't have HDA Intel support on this kernel so switched back to Ubuntu)
2010-04-06T02:28:00.000Z	histo	Ek|mu5	maybe boot acpi=off in the mean time
2010-04-06T02:28:00.000Z	Ek|mu5	histo	I first thought this issue was with gnome-power-manager so I switched to Xubuntu after trying XFCE on debian
2010-04-06T02:28:00.000Z	histo	Ek|mu5	that would tell you if its a power management issue.
2010-04-06T02:29:00.000Z	histo	Ek|mu5	also you can try changing the power management settings in bios from like s3 to s1 etc... see how it reacts.
2010-04-06T02:29:00.000Z	histo	Ek|mu5	but appending acpi=off to the kernel line should tell you if its power management related.
2010-04-06T02:30:00.000Z	Ek|mu5	histo	see that's the first thing I thought of. If I do that, brightness _sometimes_ doesn't flicker but I can't control the wireless card at all even with it turned on at boot.
2010-04-06T02:30:00.000Z	histo	Ek|mu5	thats odd anyone on the forums running your hardware yet?
2010-04-06T02:31:00.000Z	Ek|mu5	histo	also I don't have those options in the BIOS (which is the latest on the Toshiba site)
2010-04-06T02:32:00.000Z	histo	Ek|mu5	hrm..
2010-04-06T02:32:00.000Z	histo	Ek|mu5	not sure my first try would be searching the forums
2010-04-06T02:32:00.000Z	Ek|mu5	histo	none yet as far as my searching goes, but I'll post there soon after I gather up all my data from the tests I've done
2010-04-06T02:41:00.000Z	Ek|mu5	histo	setting the brightness level to notches from the lowest level resolves the flickering. Setting it any higher introduces the flickering
2010-04-06T02:41:00.000Z	Ek|mu5	histo	this is on batteries BTW. On AC, it's not an issue
2010-04-06T02:42:00.000Z	histo	Ek|mu5	yeah has to be power management related. I don't think the nvidia drivers even touch on that.
2010-04-06T02:45:00.000Z	Ek|mu5	histo	yeah, I tried tinkering with xorg and powermizer but didn't work
2010-04-06T02:47:00.000Z	Ek|mu5	histo	it's not really major since I get most of the functionality I need, but it's kind of a bummer booting up while getting shoulder surfed by Windoze users in a cafe... :D
