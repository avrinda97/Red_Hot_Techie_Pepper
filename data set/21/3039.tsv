2009-04-26T22:31:00.000Z	pragad7		has anyone used blender
2009-04-26T22:32:00.000Z	pragad7		where is it
2009-04-26T22:32:00.000Z	mav_	pragad7	to some extent, what questions do you have?
2009-04-26T22:36:00.000Z	mav_	pragad7	you have to go to the material tab ( the red sphere next to the ligh bulb). Then select a material . In the central group (w/ default setting) you'll have coor, spec and mirror components. Click on color and you'll get a color picker
2009-04-26T22:39:00.000Z	mav_	pragad7	if your monitor is so small that buttons (w/ default setting) are too small you're going to have problems with blender. I have a 1280x1024, 19" and it feels too small for blender
2009-04-26T23:06:00.000Z	mav_	pragad7	yes! in the second panel there's a tab labelsd "Col"
2009-04-26T23:00:00.000Z	pragad7	mav_	thanks for ur help. still not figured it out. still trying to find the color box.
2009-04-26T23:00:00.000Z	mav_	pragad7	I can drive you through it: start a fresh blender
2009-04-26T23:01:00.000Z	pragad7	mav_	i createda nice cup .
2009-04-26T23:02:00.000Z	mav_	pragad7	maybe nice, but I cannot see it: starts a fresh blender, then you'll be able to do the same on your design
2009-04-26T23:02:00.000Z	mav_	pragad7	you should have the default cube selected in object mode
2009-04-26T23:03:00.000Z	mav_	pragad7	the bar under the main window should say 'object mode'
2009-04-26T23:03:00.000Z	mav_	pragad7	in the bar below, you should have Panels:
2009-04-26T23:04:00.000Z	mav_	pragad7	select the third icon (a sphere)
2009-04-26T23:04:00.000Z	mav_	pragad7	good. a new list of icons appeared: select the second one (another sphere)
2009-04-26T23:05:00.000Z	mav_	pragad7	it is probably the default
2009-04-26T23:06:00.000Z	mav_	pragad7	to its left the current gray color
2009-04-26T23:07:00.000Z	mav_	pragad7	it doesn't do anything because it is the default. Sorry about that. It has been a while...
2009-04-26T23:07:00.000Z	mav_	pragad7	if now you click on the gray patch, you get a popup color picker
2009-04-26T23:10:00.000Z	mav_	pragad7	you're welcome
2009-04-26T23:11:00.000Z	mav_	pragad7	never seen this happening
