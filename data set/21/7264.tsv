2006-12-02T14:56:00.000Z	stewski		there are plenty of difficulties running linux but the lack of viruses and not needing a firewall are brilliant benefits
2006-12-02T14:57:00.000Z	stewski		I've heard it said that when you have a small gene pool you get ugly and ill a lot :-)
2006-12-02T14:57:00.000Z	nothlit	stewski	you probably still need to run a firewall
2006-12-02T14:58:00.000Z	stewski	nothlit	ubuntu runs no listening services by default
2006-12-02T14:58:00.000Z	nothlit	stewski	of course but people may still enable services like networks shares and ssh and if so...
2006-12-02T15:06:00.000Z	stewski	nothlit	yes I really like ubuntu environment the missus uses it without caring its not windows
2006-12-02T15:09:00.000Z	nothlit	stewski	it keeps track of what programs you use more often and tells ubuntu
2006-12-02T15:10:00.000Z	nothlit	stewski	dpkg-reconfigure popularity-contest
2006-12-02T15:11:00.000Z	nothlit	stewski	thats great :D
2006-12-02T15:13:00.000Z	stewski	nothlit	thats why I love ubuntu when they want to spy on us they make us use dpkg to CHOOSE to let them
2006-12-02T15:13:00.000Z	nothlit	stewski	:)
2006-12-02T15:14:00.000Z	nothlit	stewski	its not spying though, the majority windows programs out there do that, its just anonymous statistics reporting
2006-12-02T15:19:00.000Z	stewski	nothlit	what firewall are you using?
2006-12-02T15:20:00.000Z	nothlit	stewski	my router is my firewall i play with services quite often I've set up the firewall before but I don't really need it
2006-12-02T15:20:00.000Z	nothlit	stewski	if you need a gtk app and don't like firestarter, you can user fireflier-server and fireflier-client-gtk but you may need to edit a config file in /etc to login to it, and root users cant btw
2006-12-02T15:22:00.000Z	nothlit	stewski	yes all iptables/netfilter based
2006-12-02T15:23:00.000Z	nothlit	stewski	also don't bother with gnome-lokkit it's practically useless
2006-12-02T15:23:00.000Z	nothlit	stewski	if you don't mind qt/kdelibs theres guard dog      and fwbuilder
2006-12-02T15:23:00.000Z	nothlit	stewski	absolutely not iptables > windows firewall anything
2006-12-02T15:31:00.000Z	nothlit	stewski	qt may be good but it doesn't mean I want to load kdelibs and gnome libs or install a huge chunk of kde just for a single program
2006-12-02T15:32:00.000Z	nothlit	stewski	you tried listen quodlibet beep exaile and muine?
