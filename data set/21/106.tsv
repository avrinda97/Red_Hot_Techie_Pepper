2012-09-29T08:20:00.000Z	ClientAlive		my driver It installed and rebooting went fine, still have a graphical environment to go into, but it doesn't look like 3D rendering is working yet. Idk how to interpret glxinfo to tell if it is or isn't. Does someone know how to read glxinfo?
2012-09-29T08:21:00.000Z	NiteRain	ClientAlive	glxinfo | grep -i "direct render"
2012-09-29T08:24:00.000Z	NiteRain	ClientAlive	what is your opengl using?
2012-09-29T08:25:00.000Z	ClientAlive	NiteRain	will do, but, what is opengl?
2012-09-29T08:28:00.000Z	ClientAlive	NiteRain	output of glxinfo | grep -i "render": http://paste.ubuntu.com/1248839/
2012-09-29T08:29:00.000Z	ClientAlive	NiteRain	ok. Well is it using 3D rendering then?
2012-09-29T08:32:00.000Z	ClientAlive	NiteRain	Oookk. Now here is the thing. The reason I was tyring to make sure of that is because my gnome 3 is really screwed up. When I talked to the guys on #gnome yesterday, someone told me it's because my gnome is in "fallback mode" and that it does that when there is no 3D. So now I'm hearing that 3D is ok, but I'm seeing that gnome has not changed. Not sure what to do.
2012-09-29T08:33:00.000Z	NiteRain	ClientAlive	yeah, sounds like the issue I was having on Gentoo
2012-09-29T08:34:00.000Z	ClientAlive	NiteRain	hmm...
2012-09-30T06:42:00.000Z	ClientAlive	NiteRain	What up man!  :)
2012-09-30T06:43:00.000Z	ClientAlive	NiteRain	what u up to tonight?
2012-09-30T06:45:00.000Z	ClientAlive	NiteRain	ahh, something about getting games
2012-09-30T06:45:00.000Z	NiteRain	ClientAlive	how is everything going with unison?
2012-09-30T06:47:00.000Z	NiteRain	ClientAlive	stuck on the gnome side or unison side?
2012-09-30T06:47:00.000Z	ClientAlive	NiteRain	with unison. I was trying to do a relatively advanced setup (and I'm just learning it). Seems it should have worked but in the end I get errors w/ everything I try.
2012-09-30T06:49:00.000Z	ClientAlive	NiteRain	Basically, I made a "common" file that I wanted to put prefs that would be included in all my little unique .prf files. And I created a default.prf (because I beleve you have to with that type of set up). Really my motivation to all this was wanting to set up diff3 for doing merges.
2012-09-30T06:50:00.000Z	ClientAlive	NiteRain	I think it's because I misunderstood something about diff3 and how it works. I tested it (diff3) manually on some test files and it works though.
2012-09-30T06:52:00.000Z	NiteRain	ClientAlive	are we talking about the same file you put the two roots in one from your system and the other from the remote system and then add the paths you want to keep insync?
2012-09-30T06:54:00.000Z	ClientAlive	NiteRain	It would be difficult for me to explain by typing but there are three small files I could paste that pertty much show what I was after.
2012-09-30T06:57:00.000Z	ClientAlive	NiteRain	paste.ubuntu.com/1250882/   paste.ubuntu.com/1250883/   paste.ubuntu.com/1250884/
2012-09-30T06:58:00.000Z	ClientAlive	NiteRain	first is default.prf  second is common  and third is a profile I created to sync folder in my "storage" area
