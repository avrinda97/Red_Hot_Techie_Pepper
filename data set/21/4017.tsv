2008-07-30T18:14:00.000Z	schola		Is that umask problem in gnome still not solved?
2008-07-30T18:16:00.000Z	schola		how do i make gnome use the umask i want?
2008-07-30T18:17:00.000Z	unop	schola	should be under the properties of the directory in question
2008-07-30T18:17:00.000Z	schola	unop	i want to set the global umask, but gnome ignores every entry i any file.
2008-07-30T18:19:00.000Z	unop	schola	you could try setting the global umask in ~/.bash_profile
2008-07-30T18:27:00.000Z	unop	schola	did you log out and log back in?
2008-07-30T18:36:00.000Z	unop	schola	when you open up a new terminal. what is the umask reported?
2008-07-30T18:38:00.000Z	unop	schola	what is the umask reported to you when you start a new terminal?
2008-07-30T18:40:00.000Z	schola	unop	ï»¿in the terminal it say umask 0002
2008-07-30T18:41:00.000Z	unop	schola	so, currently you have set the umask you want in ~/.bash_profile? have you logged out and logged back in since?
2008-07-30T18:43:00.000Z	schola	unop	i have set it in /etc/profile  /etc/bash.bashrc   /etc/gdm/Xsession   /etc/gdm/PreSession  /etc/gdm/PostSession   ~/.gnomerc   and i think in some other files to. I read almost for one day and cannot find a solution.
2008-07-30T18:44:00.000Z	schola	unop	Thanks for helping :)
2008-07-30T18:46:00.000Z	unop	schola	well, that still doesn't answer the question of you logging out and logging back in after making the changes -- if you make changes to one of ~/.profile, ~/.bash_profile or /etc/profile - and want those changes replicated into the GUI, you need to log back in, otherwise the changes are insignificant
2008-07-30T18:49:00.000Z	unop	schola	ahh well, try this.   open up a terminal. and run this command.   umask 077 && nautilus .  # create a directory in nautilus, and you should see that group and other have no permissions over the directory
2008-07-30T18:53:00.000Z	schola	unop	yes i rebooted, but the problem remains.
2008-07-30T19:00:00.000Z	schola	unop	can you reproduce my problem?
2008-07-30T19:01:00.000Z	schola	unop	i would like to know if this is a generell problem.
2008-07-30T19:03:00.000Z	unop	schola	i don't use gnome - so i can't really replicate your problem --
2008-07-30T19:18:00.000Z	schola	unop	thanks for your attention anyway!  It is hard not to rant when gnome has such basic bugs!   http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=809436
2008-07-30T19:23:00.000Z	unop	schola	not sure what that is all about - but if bash is your login shell and you have set a umask in one of ~/.bash* - the umask ought to be replicated out into the enviornment unless of course one of the gnome scripts changes this back to some set value.
2008-07-30T19:38:00.000Z	schola	unop	it seems to be two bugs in gdm and nautilus. And gnome developers consider it as minor since nobody sends in good patches, while the code of gdm is unreadable. :(
