2011-03-21T09:03:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Zup	What you could do is to make sure you've got the latest version of flashplayer...
2011-03-21T09:04:00.000Z	Zup	YankDownUnder	Just run update in ternima?
2011-03-21T09:04:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Zup	Er...yeah...ya could do that...
2011-03-21T09:05:00.000Z	Zup	YankDownUnder	Did that the moment it stop working... I even uninstalled flash and reinstalled everything back
2011-03-21T09:05:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Zup	Best way: sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade && apt-get update && exit
2011-03-21T09:05:00.000Z	Zup	YankDownUnder	I did that, but with aptitude
2011-03-21T09:06:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Zup	Does flash work in Chrome (if you've got it installed) => as well, which version of flash are you using?
2011-03-21T09:06:00.000Z	Zup	YankDownUnder	Yes, it works fine i Chrome... which why I am lost
2011-03-21T09:06:00.000Z	Zup	YankDownUnder	Not sure what version... how do I check for that?
2011-03-21T09:07:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Zup	What you might try to do - if it doesn't bother you - is to back up your FF bookmarks, blow out the ~/.mozilla directory, then restart FF, re-import yer bookmarks - test if flash works...
2011-03-21T09:08:00.000Z	Zup	YankDownUnder	Okay I will try that then, be back in a flash hahaha
2011-03-21T09:09:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Zup	Hey - something I use on some machines is called "Flash-Aid" - helps to resolve conflicts with flash versions mate...check that out as well...
2011-03-21T09:09:00.000Z	Zup	YankDownUnder	Hmm okay, will try that first then... brb
2011-03-21T09:16:00.000Z	Zup	YankDownUnder	Flash-Aid worked perfect!! thank you soo  much!
2011-03-21T09:16:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Zup	Coolbeans mate. Don't nuke Australia, and I'll be happy. :)
2011-03-21T09:16:00.000Z	Zup	YankDownUnder	It took off Flash Pluginstaller something rather and then reinstalled some other things
2011-03-21T09:17:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Zup	Yeppers - it installed "the real deal" instead of the other carpie stuff...
2011-03-21T09:17:00.000Z	Zup	YankDownUnder	You know what I think happened? I deleted everything in Macromedai and something must have not liked that
