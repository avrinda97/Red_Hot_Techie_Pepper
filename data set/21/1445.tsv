2010-09-11T10:57:00.000Z	mkcpys		How do I change which of my monitors is my default/primary desktop? I really want to move my panels onto my bigger monitor.
2010-09-11T10:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mkcpys	 you can alt-click on the panels and drag them where you want.
2010-09-11T10:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mkcpys	 the nvidia-settings tool has a check box for that option also.
2010-09-11T11:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mkcpys	 alt-click on the panels and drag them over to the other monitor
2010-09-11T11:13:00.000Z	mkcpys	Dr_Willis	-- What are you some kind of genius ???!!!???!!!
2010-09-11T11:14:00.000Z	mkcpys	Dr_Willis	- I guess so, you're a doctor. Thanks. That just did it I think
2010-09-11T11:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mkcpys	 i mentioned the alt-click-drag thing some time ago. :) People never listen to their doctors.
2010-09-11T11:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mkcpys	 that did NOT make the monitors primary.. it just moved the  panels. You can have panels on both monitors
2010-09-11T11:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mkcpys	 GDM will still appear on the other monitor
2010-09-11T11:20:00.000Z	mkcpys	Dr_Willis	- Sorry, I missed it.
2010-09-11T11:20:00.000Z	mkcpys	Dr_Willis	- What is GDM ?
2010-09-11T11:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mkcpys	 your LOGIN screen
2010-09-11T11:20:00.000Z	mkcpys	Dr_Willis	- Well, that's ok.
2010-09-11T11:22:00.000Z	mkcpys	Dr_Willis	I also notice that certain pop-ups still pop up on the other monitor - regardless of where their parent window is. That's slightly annoying.
2010-09-11T11:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mkcpys	 so swap cabels.. or use the ati drivers.. i cant imagine why you dont want to use the ati drivers..
2010-09-11T11:31:00.000Z	mkcpys	Dr_Willis	- When I use the ATI drivers I can't figure how to stop the massive tearing in video playback. I've tried everything I could think of, and much of what others have suggested.
2010-09-11T11:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mkcpys	 I dont use ati any more.. all i can suggest that if using compiz enable that 'sync to blank' option. that removed mosta ll the tearing ive seen in  my video playback
2010-09-11T11:33:00.000Z	mkcpys	Dr_Willis	Yeah, I've tried that. To be honest, I don't see why I need to use the drivers.
2010-09-11T11:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mkcpys	 the way ati works.. in 6 mo they will remove your card from their supported drivers list.. so you wont be able to anyway
2010-09-11T11:50:00.000Z	mkcpys	Dr_Willis	Now if I could just figure out how to get my USB Mic interface to work with Alsa/Audacity. It shows up, but doesn't work. You don't happen to know anything about that do ya?
2010-09-11T11:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mkcpys	 not really. onlyh mics i use are built in to the webcam ont he laptops
