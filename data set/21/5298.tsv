2012-07-12T09:48:00.000Z	bonny		Works completely fine on windows..
2012-07-12T09:48:00.000Z	sacul	bonny	That doesn't seem like a java problem to me.. it seems like a problem with your network configuration
2012-07-12T09:49:00.000Z	bonny	sacul	Do you know how I can fix it?
2012-07-12T09:51:00.000Z	sacul	bonny	but you do enter the ip address and port number in the game when you add the server.. just confirm that those are the same
2012-07-12T09:51:00.000Z	bonny	sacul	I tried both.
2012-07-12T09:52:00.000Z	bonny	sacul	Whats the latest version of java?
2012-07-12T09:52:00.000Z	sacul	bonny	do you mind sharing the ip and port?  i can check and see if i can see it
2012-07-12T09:53:00.000Z	bonny	sacul	Ok
2012-07-12T09:53:00.000Z	bonny	sacul	5.20.165.49:25565
2012-07-12T09:55:00.000Z	bonny	sacul	Does it work?
2012-07-12T09:56:00.000Z	sacul	bonny	i can see it.. but can't connect to it either
2012-07-12T09:57:00.000Z	bonny	sacul	What is the latest version of java?
2012-07-12T10:00:00.000Z	sacul	bonny	I think the server is having issues.. I'm getting the same error on my install of mine craft on my mac
2012-07-12T10:02:00.000Z	sacul	bonny	Mac uses Oracle Java and i have the same error.
2012-07-12T10:03:00.000Z	bonny	sacul	But there are people playing on the server.
2012-07-12T10:03:00.000Z	sacul	bonny	I see that.  maybe they joined before the troubles began?
2012-07-12T10:04:00.000Z	bonny	sacul	Like i said earlier, it works on my windows side.
2012-07-12T10:05:00.000Z	bonny	sacul	The server shutdown and the owner said the ip had changed.
2012-07-12T10:05:00.000Z	bonny	sacul	That is the new ip i sent you see for yourself bunnyxd.com
2012-07-12T10:06:00.000Z	sacul	bonny	I dunno then bonny
2012-07-12T10:18:00.000Z	sacul	bonny	"sudo apt-get purge openjdk*"
