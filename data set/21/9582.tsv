2005-08-28T06:04:00.000Z	sean_		does the term: swapiness ring a bell to anyone in here?
2005-08-28T06:05:00.000Z	bluesceada	sean_	yeah a bit ..
2005-08-28T06:05:00.000Z	sean_	bluesceada	i've got mine at 40. instead of 60, think its a reasonable value for a 64mb <ram> machine?
2005-08-28T06:05:00.000Z	bluesceada	sean_	depends on what you do the most i think
2005-08-28T06:06:00.000Z	bluesceada		that means it swaps less, and tries to clean ram first
2005-08-28T06:06:00.000Z	sean_		everything, lol, no gaming, but word processing, browsing, IM, radio, etc..
2005-08-28T06:06:00.000Z	bluesceada		hm you could even set it lower .. if you want
2005-08-28T06:07:00.000Z	sean_		i might just do that, wasnt sure if id be butchering the chicken thou
2005-08-28T06:07:00.000Z	bluesceada		and maybe try using cfq for your hard drives then
2005-08-28T06:08:00.000Z	sean_		cfq?? havent heard that term before
2005-08-28T06:08:00.000Z	bluesceada		completely fair queueing gives all programs the same performance ... or how you could say it ..
2005-08-28T06:08:00.000Z	sean_		oh wow, i like the sound of that
2005-08-28T06:08:00.000Z	bluesceada		elevator=cfq as a kernel parameter
2005-08-28T06:08:00.000Z	sean_		sounds like im rebuilding my kernel :)
2005-08-28T06:09:00.000Z	bluesceada		hm should be in it
2005-08-28T06:09:00.000Z	bluesceada		you can even change the scheduler on the fly afaik ..
2005-08-28T06:09:00.000Z	bluesceada		with the procfs
2005-08-28T06:09:00.000Z	sean_		wow, thats indepth, where can i find some docs?
2005-08-28T06:10:00.000Z	sean_		thank you, and thank you too :)
2005-08-28T06:10:00.000Z	bluesceada		google ;)
2005-08-28T06:22:00.000Z	bluesceada	sean_	btw. you can change the swapiness on the fly in the file /proc/sys/vm/swappiness .. just echo the number that you want to that file
