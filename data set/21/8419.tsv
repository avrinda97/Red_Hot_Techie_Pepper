2006-04-10T12:35:00.000Z	PwcrLinux		ah, my lappy have a 768 MB of ram, I looked at the terminal box to check ram size,, I use free command, then I puzzled it's fattened up to 776 MB, how strange on my lappy ram?
2006-04-10T12:37:00.000Z	bliss1_	PwcrLinux	whats freecommand
2006-04-10T12:45:00.000Z	bliss1_	PwcrLinux	well how does this free boost memory

2006-04-10T12:51:00.000Z	bliss1_	PwcrLinux	there has to be some prog that boosts RAM or makes your processor more efficient
2006-04-10T12:54:00.000Z	bliss1_	PwcrLinux	thanks time for a shower then its almost 8

2006-04-20T13:57:00.000Z	bliss1_	PwcrLinux	  my question is if I cannot invoke shutdown -r now then the only option is to invoke shutdown -h now  will I loose ant data by doing a shutdown rather than a reboot?
2006-04-20T13:57:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	bliss1_	timed event or manually?
2006-04-20T13:59:00.000Z	bliss1_	PwcrLinux	at the prompt right now -manually I suppose
2006-04-20T14:00:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	bliss1_	You can do  'sudo reboot' if in case stuck in terminal box or adverted into full screen..
2006-04-20T14:03:00.000Z	bliss1_	PwcrLinux	ok i will try to make the question clear  I have just done a howto the last command is shutdown -r now ok , but without going into a long reason why I cannot reboot if I do shutnow -h now will I loose any data
2006-04-20T14:04:00.000Z	PwcrLinux	bliss1_	unsaved workspace would lose..
2006-04-20T14:05:00.000Z	bliss1_	PwcrLinux	so how to save before shutdown????
