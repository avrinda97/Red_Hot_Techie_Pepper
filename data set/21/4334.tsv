2008-09-22T20:26:00.000Z	ChrizC		jrib; it's also impossible to install Ubuntu from a non-exsistant disc.
2008-09-22T20:26:00.000Z	ChrizC		_Zeus_; so you're saying that the company Ubuntu has teamed up with, provides bad discs?
2008-09-22T20:27:00.000Z	ChrizC		jrib; my cd drive doesn't like to burn ISO's properly, for some reason.
2008-09-22T20:28:00.000Z	ChrizC		for god sakes, stop the highlights ¬¬
2008-09-22T20:29:00.000Z	ChrizC		jrib; I can't download it, I can't torrent it, no one in my local area likes Linux, so won't burn it, and the CD's take too long to get here for me to order another one.
2008-09-22T20:30:00.000Z	ChrizC		_Zeus_; Southwest.
2008-09-22T20:30:00.000Z	ChrizC		jrib; I'm not paying for something I can get for free, lols.
2008-09-22T20:30:00.000Z	ChrizC		jrib; the good ol' united kingdom.
2008-09-22T20:30:00.000Z	ChrizC		Obviously not, _Zeus_, seeing as I'm on this IRC channel ¬¬
2008-09-22T20:31:00.000Z	ChrizC		I can't download it because it takes too long and when it gets near the end, my windows always fails.
2008-09-22T20:31:00.000Z	Chousuke	ChrizC	why can't you torrent it?
2008-09-22T20:38:00.000Z	Chousuke	ChrizC	CD burners are practically free
2008-09-22T20:38:00.000Z	Chousuke	ChrizC	either you live with your broken drive or buy a new one
2008-09-22T20:39:00.000Z	Chousuke	ChrizC	Your problem is not directly with ubuntu so we can't really help you other than by providing general advice :/
2008-09-22T20:41:00.000Z	Chousuke	ChrizC	and there's no way for you to do an USB install? :/
2008-09-22T20:42:00.000Z	ChrizC	Chousuke	I have an mp3 player,
2008-09-22T20:42:00.000Z	Chousuke	ChrizC	hm, it might work, if you can somehow get ubuntu on it
2008-09-22T20:42:00.000Z	Chousuke	ChrizC	and then boot from it
2008-09-22T20:43:00.000Z	Chousuke	ChrizC	I'm not sure how to do an USB install, but I know it's possible... now If I just could remember the factoid
2008-09-22T20:44:00.000Z	Chousuke	ChrizC	then you probably need to tweak some bios setting to make it boot from USB
2008-09-22T20:44:00.000Z	Chousuke	ChrizC	most modern (and not so modern) computers can boot from USB
