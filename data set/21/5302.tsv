2007-11-16T02:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	domor	you did not need to reinstall... you can always reconfigure from cli
2007-11-16T02:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	domor	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-11-16T02:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	domor	if it fails to start ...  go into recovery mode and type           sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg         select vesa to get back basic gui
2007-11-16T06:57:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	domor	at the blank screen.. sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-11-16T06:58:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	domor	Just as often as the video card config I find people have not setup their monitor correctly in xorg.
2007-11-16T06:59:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	domor	cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf ~/Desktop/xorg.conf.$(date +%m-%d-%Y-%T)          is a way to make a copy.. for next time...
2007-11-16T07:01:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	domor	run that command I posted and see what happens
2007-11-16T07:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	domor	cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf ~/Desktop/xorg.conf.$(date +%m-%d-%Y-%T)
2007-11-16T07:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	domor	that will copy your xorg.. if it exists to your desktop
2007-11-16T07:05:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	domor	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-11-16T07:12:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	domor	we have told you repeatedly how to do it
2007-11-16T07:13:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	domor	Paste your xorg to the pastebin and post the link in here so we can help you
