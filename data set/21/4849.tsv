2008-01-30T09:12:00.000Z	hellotherehere		Hi, I have phpmyadmin and phppgadmin installed but when I go to 127.0.0.1/... I dont see them, I think i ned to add shortcuts for them there. how to do that?
2008-01-30T09:14:00.000Z	Cpudan80	hellotherehere	you need to create a symlink
2008-01-30T09:14:00.000Z	hellotherehere	Cpudan80	yes I know, but how to create it?
2008-01-30T09:15:00.000Z	Cpudan80	hellotherehere	cd to /var/www and do
2008-01-30T09:15:00.000Z	Cpudan80	hellotherehere	sudo ln -s /usr/share/phpmyadmin phpmyadmin
2008-01-30T09:17:00.000Z	hellotherehere	Cpudan80	did it, but still nothing
2008-01-30T09:17:00.000Z	Cpudan80	hellotherehere	then you did it wrong
2008-01-30T09:18:00.000Z	Cpudan80	hellotherehere	were you in /var/www when you made the link thing
2008-01-30T09:18:00.000Z	Cpudan80	hellotherehere	do ls -l in the /var/www directory and make sure the link you made actually works (should be light blue pointing to blue)
2008-01-30T09:22:00.000Z	hellotherehere	Cpudan80	did it, and now I see icon in the www directory, but when I try to reach it it gives me permission denied, the owner of the icon in www is root
2008-01-30T09:23:00.000Z	hellotherehere	Cpudan80	shouldnt the www directory be owned by www-data
2008-01-30T09:23:00.000Z	Cpudan80	hellotherehere	sudo chmod 755 /usr/share/phpmyadmin
2008-01-30T09:23:00.000Z	Cpudan80	hellotherehere	no, should be owned by root
2008-01-30T09:26:00.000Z	hellotherehere	Cpudan80	I got this chmod: cannot access `/usr/share/phpmyadmin': No such file or directory
2008-01-30T09:27:00.000Z	Cpudan80	hellotherehere	then you didn't install the package correctly
2008-01-30T09:28:00.000Z	hellotherehere	Cpudan80	thats how I installed it sudo apt-get install mysql-server-5.0
2008-01-30T09:29:00.000Z	hellotherehere	Cpudan80	what should be the chmod for the www directory
2008-01-30T09:29:00.000Z	Cpudan80	hellotherehere	nothing, keep it as is
2008-01-30T09:30:00.000Z	hellotherehere	Cpudan80	I will remove mysql and install it again from the synaptic
2008-01-30T09:30:00.000Z	Cpudan80	hellotherehere	phpmyadmin != mysql
2008-01-30T09:31:00.000Z	hellotherehere	Cpudan80	nickrud: I will install both from the synaptic
