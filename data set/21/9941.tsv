2005-06-12T15:49:00.000Z	n00dle		it'd be appreciative if someone might be able to assist me with this issue, otherwise in about a half an hour i'll probably install another distribution, as ironically one of the only distributions boasting a dedicated laptop support team, doesnt suport my laptop, heh.
2005-06-12T15:50:00.000Z	n00dle		user list?
2005-06-12T15:50:00.000Z	n00dle		I though that's what this channel was for.
2005-06-12T15:50:00.000Z	Fikrann	n00dle	it would help if we knew what the problem is.
2005-06-12T15:52:00.000Z	Fikrann	n00dle	is your cd drive in some hotswap bay?
2005-06-12T15:52:00.000Z	Fikrann	n00dle	sorta?
2005-06-12T15:53:00.000Z	Fikrann	n00dle	state your laptop model and make.
2005-06-12T15:54:00.000Z	Fikrann	n00dle	iy you need to open your laptop to replace it, it's not hotswappable.
2005-06-12T15:54:00.000Z	n00dle	Fikrann	- it is also analagous to this american laptop: http://www.ecsusa.com/products/g220.html
2005-06-12T15:56:00.000Z	Fikrann	n00dle	this page does not state any useful information...
2005-06-12T15:57:00.000Z	Fikrann	n00dle	and I think I'm typing it on a very similar machine. }:>~
2005-06-12T15:59:00.000Z	Fikrann	n00dle	Have you tried expert mode?
2005-06-12T16:00:00.000Z	n00dle	Fikrann	- im doing that right now
2005-06-12T16:02:00.000Z	Fikrann	n00dle	let it autoprobe all modules.
2005-06-12T16:06:00.000Z	Fikrann	n00dle	disregard that one.
2005-06-12T16:07:00.000Z	Fikrann	n00dle	if you don't have floppy drive the installer will be trying to add floppy module every time it can.
2005-06-12T16:08:00.000Z	n00dle	Fikrann	i assume that's a bug as well, but probably already listed.
2005-06-12T16:10:00.000Z	Fikrann	n00dle	2.6.10
2005-06-12T16:18:00.000Z	n00dle	Fikrann	- perhaps it is not a bug.
2005-06-12T16:19:00.000Z	Fikrann	n00dle	wha?
2005-06-12T16:20:00.000Z	Fikrann	n00dle	it does that every time, I'm quite certain it was reported already
