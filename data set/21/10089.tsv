2005-06-19T13:56:00.000Z	Seveas	_alex	do NOT paste in here
2005-06-19T13:56:00.000Z	Seveas	_alex	try apt-get install libqt3c102-mt
2005-06-19T13:57:00.000Z	Seveas	_alex	hmmz
2005-06-19T13:58:00.000Z	Seveas	_alex	given the errors i see, you are using non-ubuntu repositories
2005-06-19T13:58:00.000Z	Seveas	_alex	no easy way
2005-06-19T13:58:00.000Z	_alex	Seveas	yes
2005-06-19T13:59:00.000Z	Seveas	_alex	you should not use these repositories if you don't know pinning ...
2005-06-19T13:59:00.000Z	Seveas	_alex	remove all non-ubuntu repositories from your sources.list and retry
2005-06-19T13:59:00.000Z	_alex	Seveas	I know... Actually I wasn't aware that synaptic was always taking the breezy when avaliable
2005-06-19T14:01:00.000Z	_alex	Seveas	are you confident that a dist-upgrade will downgrade some of my packages... I did a fix in my sources list and ans upgrade but it didn't chang a thing
2005-06-19T14:01:00.000Z	Seveas	_alex	i am confident that it will *not* downgrdae anything
2005-06-19T14:03:00.000Z	_alex	Seveas	You would recommend a clean reinstall and stopping doing stupid things on my sources.list or does it worth a shot to wait a bit for the kdelibs4 to be avalaible in repositories?
2005-06-19T14:03:00.000Z	Seveas	_alex	the former
2005-06-19T14:04:00.000Z	_alex	Seveas	sorry about my English but I didn't catch "former"
2005-06-26T15:29:00.000Z	Seveas	_alex	yes
