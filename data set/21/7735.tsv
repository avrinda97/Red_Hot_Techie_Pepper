2010-04-28T03:09:00.000Z	Guest95817		any one know how install ubuntu 8.04 in ext4 file system
2010-04-28T03:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest95817	I think you can, but it won't be supported
2010-04-28T03:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest95817	apparantly can get similar advantages to Ext4,  with XFS, but then you may also need a seperate Ext3 /boot partition for Grub
2010-04-28T03:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest95817	ok
2010-04-28T03:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest95817	well you can try 10.04 released this Thursday,  however 8.04 also gets certain advantages over 10.04 really.  Also 8.04 is supported on the desktop untill  April next year.
2010-04-28T03:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest95817	plus 10.10 gets released in October, and there are other good distros out there as well.   Anyway which card?
2010-04-28T03:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest95817	of 8.04, you mean 10.04?
2010-04-28T03:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest95817	ok what are you currently running?
2010-04-28T03:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest95817	also there  was/is some sort of xorg issue in 10.04 that makes things slow, but that  will be fixed by the final.   As for Backtrack 4 that should only realy be used by security professioanls.
2010-04-28T03:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest95817	it is not really a desktop/laptop OS, it's a special security  testing distro
2010-04-28T03:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest95817	plus as Pici pointed out, Backtrack also isn't supported here
2010-04-28T03:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest95817	that depends on the card
2010-04-28T03:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest95817	It seems 10.04, will get better open drivers for ATI and Nivida or something,  well  Thursday is the final, but the download servers will be packed,  downloading the ISO burning contents to CD (ideally checking for a good download first the md5sum/sha1sum)  and booting up computer from Live CD and trying, on Saturday, should be alright.
2010-04-28T03:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest95817	if you end up having to use 8.04,  or another distro though, so be it
2010-04-28T03:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest95817	also I guess this link  will be useful  later on
2010-04-28T03:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest95817	and I mentioned ISO checking, but never  got the bot to give you a link, it's a good thing to do, even though,  downloads will be fine 99% of the time.
2010-04-28T03:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest95817	I actsauly prefer 8.04,  to 9.10 and 10.04 :)  however I won't use it anymore since...  well I guess i'll vm it again some time  just like 8.10
2010-04-28T03:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest95817	Why I prefer 8.04?
2010-04-28T03:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest95817	that's off topic, but you can pm me, if you really want to know
2010-04-28T03:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest95817	ok :)
2010-04-28T03:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Guest95817	well it's fine to still use 8.04, whilst it's still being supported, which it will be on the desktop untill April next year
