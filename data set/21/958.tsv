2011-03-28T11:07:00.000Z	pfifo	dBugSlayer	im good with gdb, but your python part is throwing me off. If i understand this your trying to install a python module via an approved ubuntu method... why not just install it manually?
2011-03-28T11:09:00.000Z	dBugSlayer	pfifo	I'm trying to use gdb's pretty printer.
2011-03-28T11:09:00.000Z	pfifo	dBugSlayer	well as for another channel, you can try #python or #gdb
2011-03-28T11:10:00.000Z	dBugSlayer	pfifo	What I understand so far is that I'm missing /usr/share/gdb/python/libstdcxx/v6/printers.py
2011-03-28T11:10:00.000Z	dBugSlayer	pfifo	do you happen to have this file?
2011-03-28T11:11:00.000Z	pfifo	dBugSlayer	google should have it, ive had alot of luck finding missing py files for blender
2011-03-28T11:12:00.000Z	dBugSlayer	pfifo	I've been googling for a while now. I guess I'll keep looking.
2011-03-28T11:12:00.000Z	dBugSlayer	pfifo	could you try something real quick for me?
2011-03-28T11:12:00.000Z	pfifo	dBugSlayer	ok
2011-03-28T11:13:00.000Z	dBugSlayer	pfifo	execute this on gdb: python import gdb.libstdcxx
2011-03-28T11:13:00.000Z	dBugSlayer	pfifo	and see if whether you get an ImportError
2011-03-28T11:14:00.000Z	pfifo	dBugSlayer	ImportError: No module named libstdcxx
2011-03-28T11:15:00.000Z	dBugSlayer	pfifo	are you running Ubuntu 10.10?
2011-03-28T11:15:00.000Z	pfifo	dBugSlayer	yeah 10.10 and I have tons of developer stuff setup
2011-03-28T11:17:00.000Z	dBugSlayer	pfifo	for whatever reason this module is not installed. I just cloned gdb's repo with the hopes I'll find something in there that will help me figure this out
2011-03-28T11:18:00.000Z	dBugSlayer	pfifo	and you also have libstdc++ 6 installed, correct?
2011-03-28T11:19:00.000Z	pfifo	dBugSlayer	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 19 2010-11-13 11:58 /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6 -> libstdc++.so.6.0.14
2011-03-28T11:20:00.000Z	dBugSlayer	pfifo	what about /usr/share/gdb/python/libstdcxx/v6/printers.py?
2011-03-28T11:21:00.000Z	pfifo	dBugSlayer	no, i dont like python so i only have minimal python related stuff
2011-03-28T11:21:00.000Z	dBugSlayer	pfifo	k
2011-03-28T11:42:00.000Z	dBugSlayer	pfifo	histo: I figured it out. Thanks for your help!
