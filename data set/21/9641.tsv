2005-09-16T05:49:00.000Z	WaterSevenUb		hey guys... when starting "Beagled" I get 05-09-11 12.49.05.55 12424 Beagle FATAL: Could not set extended attributes on a file in your home directory.  See http://www.beaglewiki.org/Enabling_Extended_Attributes for more information.
2005-09-16T05:49:00.000Z	WaterSevenUb		any solution?
2005-09-16T05:50:00.000Z	HappyFool	WaterSevenUb	i don't use beagle, but i'd guess reading that page would be a good start
2005-09-16T05:51:00.000Z	WaterSevenUb		Happyfool, Yeah... I've read it already ;)
2005-09-16T05:52:00.000Z	HappyFool	WaterSevenUb	ok, and the instructions didn't work?
2005-09-16T05:53:00.000Z	WaterSevenUb		happyfool, nope... I guess I'm misunderstanding something. I don't have a separate /Home partition, it's inside root. How do I start / with the user_xattr property?
2005-09-16T05:54:00.000Z	HappyFool	WaterSevenUb	you can add it to the / entry in /etc/fstab
2005-09-16T05:54:00.000Z	HappyFool	WaterSevenUb	i'm not familiar with this extension, though
2005-09-16T05:55:00.000Z	HappyFool	WaterSevenUb	if you look in /etc/fstab, you should see an entry for / (it's just after /proc in mine)
2005-09-16T05:55:00.000Z	WaterSevenUb		happyfool, yape... :) can I remount it while active? I have to restart right?
2005-09-16T05:55:00.000Z	HappyFool	WaterSevenUb	a remount might work
2005-09-16T05:56:00.000Z	WaterSevenUb		happyfoold, going to try, thx.
2005-09-16T05:56:00.000Z	HappyFool	WaterSevenUb	something like 'sudo mount -o remount /' maybe; i'm not sure how risky that is
2005-09-16T06:02:00.000Z	WaterSevenUb	HappyFool	well... it solved the problem :-) but the beagle daemon is not starting with some other error.... grrr
2005-09-16T06:02:00.000Z	HappyFool	WaterSevenUb	what are you running? hoary?
2005-09-16T06:02:00.000Z	WaterSevenUb		happyfool, yape...
2005-09-16T06:02:00.000Z	HappyFool	WaterSevenUb	why not just wait for breezy -- i *think* it will have beagle

2005-09-16T06:03:00.000Z	WaterSevenUb		happyfool, because I'm very impatient :) yes it will... but I've used backports.
