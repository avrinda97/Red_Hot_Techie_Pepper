2012-05-14T20:20:00.000Z	ssbr_		I didn't install this OS.
2012-05-14T20:22:00.000Z	ssbr_		aha, found it
2012-05-14T20:22:00.000Z	ssbr_		Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
2012-05-14T20:23:00.000Z	ssbr_		how do I open the system settings in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, from the command line?
2012-05-14T20:24:00.000Z	ssbr_		eh, you mean -center right?
2012-05-14T20:26:00.000Z	ssbr_		man, what
2012-05-14T20:26:00.000Z	ssbr_		you're right
2012-05-14T20:26:00.000Z	ssbr_		what happened to the visual settings configuration menus? :(
2012-05-14T20:28:00.000Z	ssbr_		so wait, the only way to configure fonts on a gnome system is to download ubuntu-tweak
2012-05-14T20:29:00.000Z	ssbr_		even though ubuntu-tweak is for ubuntu, which runs unity?
2012-05-14T20:29:00.000Z	fidel	ssbr_	you need the gnome-tweak-tool ;)
2012-05-14T20:29:00.000Z	fidel		which has "gnome" in its name for the gnome-stuff
2012-05-14T20:30:00.000Z	fidel		on the other hand there is myunity for the unity things ...and ubuntu-tweak for ...well partly both
2012-05-14T20:30:00.000Z	ssbr_		I was sure this used to be less complicated
2012-05-14T20:30:00.000Z	fidel		isnt complicated at all ;)
2012-05-14T20:30:00.000Z	ssbr_	fidel	on KDE you just open the system default config editor
2012-05-14T20:30:00.000Z	fidel	ssbr_	then use kde ;)
2012-05-14T20:30:00.000Z	ssbr_		rather than dealing with like 5 different suggestions for configuration editors
2012-05-14T20:31:00.000Z	ssbr_		I don't even know how I'm running gnome.
2012-05-14T20:31:00.000Z	ssbr_		I'm just running xmonad and gedit, man
2012-05-14T20:31:00.000Z	fidel	ssbr_	select it at the login-manager
