2010-01-31T21:53:00.000Z	hlfshell		So I just instlaled Ubuntu 9.10 on my newish laptop (its old, but newly mine) and the notifications that are popping up are all black with some what "scratches" - it looks horrible. How can I fix tihs?
2010-01-31T21:54:00.000Z	kn100	hlfshell	mind getting a screenshot of it?
2010-01-31T21:54:00.000Z	kn100	hlfshell	http://imgur.com/ will do
2010-01-31T21:54:00.000Z	kn100	hlfshell	not stupid at all
2010-01-31T21:55:00.000Z	kn100	hlfshell	open a terminal, sudo apt-get install notify-send, then once its done just type notify-send "whatever"
2010-01-31T21:56:00.000Z	kn100	hlfshell	try libnotify-bin
2010-01-31T21:56:00.000Z	kn100	hlfshell	now just type notify-send "whatever" "whatever"

2010-01-31T21:57:00.000Z	kn100	hlfshell	wow that is weird
2010-01-31T21:57:00.000Z	hlfshell	kn100	i also have al leffects turned off
2010-01-31T21:58:00.000Z	kn100	hlfshell	try enabling compiz (set effects on)
2010-01-31T21:58:00.000Z	kn100	hlfshell	What graphics card do you have?
2010-01-31T22:00:00.000Z	kn100	hlfshell	I have a funny feeling you are having driver issues, hlfshell there are replacements, but its probably best to fix this
2010-01-31T22:01:00.000Z	kn100	hlfshell	give me a second to do some research into your laptop
2010-01-31T22:02:00.000Z	kn100	hlfshell	open a terminal, type lspci, then paste the output to http://pastebin.ca/ (to copy in a terminal press ctrl+shift+c)
2010-01-31T22:04:00.000Z	kn100	hlfshell	Oh lawd, you have an ATI laptop, ATI are very quirky on ubuntu
2010-01-31T22:05:00.000Z	kn100	hlfshell	looking into it now
2010-01-31T22:07:00.000Z	kn100	hlfshell	Ok, I don't have a clue, since according to the internet the drivers for your card (Radeon Mobility 7500) are already bundled with ubuntu, so I think someone else will have to help you, as this is out of my depth
2010-01-31T22:08:00.000Z	kn100	hlfshell	to disable the notifications I guess you could just disable them, but that seems a bit extreme
2010-01-31T22:09:00.000Z	kn100	hlfshell	you can uninstall them with sudo apt-get remove notify-osd
2010-01-31T22:10:00.000Z	kn100	hlfshell	I suggest you ask your question again including the name of your card (mobility 7500)
