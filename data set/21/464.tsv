2011-12-07T01:06:00.000Z	Barbarian	lnxslck	lemme guess, Optimus enabled?
2011-12-07T01:07:00.000Z	lnxslck	Barbarian	how did you install it? i did apt-get install nvidia-current and then nvidia-xsetting and got a back screen every time i wanted to login
2011-12-07T01:07:00.000Z	lnxslck	Barbarian	i have a laptop with intel graphci card integrated and an nvidia graphic card too
2011-12-07T01:08:00.000Z	Barbarian	lnxslck	Does your model of graphics card advertise something called "Optimus" technology?
2011-12-07T01:11:00.000Z	lnxslck	Barbarian	dont think so
2011-12-07T01:11:00.000Z	Barbarian	lnxslck	What model is it?
2011-12-07T01:12:00.000Z	lnxslck	Barbarian	asus k53s
2011-12-07T01:13:00.000Z	lnxslck	Barbarian	http://www.asus.com/Notebooks/Versatile_Performance/K53SC/#specifications
2011-12-07T01:13:00.000Z	Barbarian	lnxslck	One sec, looking it up
2011-12-07T01:13:00.000Z	lnxslck	Barbarian	this is the link: http://www.asus.com/Notebooks/Versatile_Performance/K53SC/#specifications
2011-12-07T01:13:00.000Z	lnxslck	Barbarian	just wanted to get nvidia drivers working
2011-12-07T01:14:00.000Z	lnxslck	Barbarian	using the xorg file created by nvidia causes my login manager to freeze
2011-12-07T01:14:00.000Z	Barbarian	lnxslck	I have a sneaking suspicion it's the same problem I had
2011-12-07T01:14:00.000Z	lnxslck	Barbarian	what have you done to fix it?
2011-12-07T01:15:00.000Z	Barbarian	lnxslck	get this ppa https://launchpad.net/~mj-casalogic/+archive/ironhide do "sudo apt-get install ironhide" and whenever you wanna run a program using the card preface it with "optirun"
2011-12-07T01:19:00.000Z	lnxslck	Barbarian	that's not the kind of solution i'm looking for but thanks anyway
2011-12-07T01:19:00.000Z	Barbarian	lnxslck	it's not the one I wanted either
2011-12-07T01:19:00.000Z	Barbarian	lnxslck	But nvidia is well known for only supporting windows
2011-12-07T01:20:00.000Z	lnxslck	Barbarian	not really, i had nvidia a log time ago on linux with no problems
