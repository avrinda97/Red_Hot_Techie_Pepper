2012-10-17T21:01:00.000Z	DX099		hello, can someone give me a hint on why my bios would only boot Live USB created under Windows ? sometimes, the sticks created by the same program will not boot with the Linux version (UnetBootin)... I never managed to get a Live USB generated a linux software to work with my computer, when it always does with Windows...
2012-10-17T21:02:00.000Z	theadmin	DX099	That's because you're overdoing it ;) isohybrid something.iso ; sudo dd if=something.iso of=/dev/sdz (where sdz is your USB stick. Also note that it's sdz, not sdz1)
2012-10-17T21:02:00.000Z	DX099	theadmin	never heard of that "isohybrid" thing but just the name sounds like a solution to me...
2012-10-17T21:03:00.000Z	DX099	theadmin	i'm downloading 12.10 daily right now, i'll test it right away
2012-10-17T21:03:00.000Z	theadmin	DX099	The "isohybrid" part is actually unnecessary with most modern distributions, they provide hybrid ISOs already.
2012-10-17T21:03:00.000Z	theadmin	DX099	So you won't need it with Ubuntu 12.04 and up
2012-10-17T21:03:00.000Z	theadmin	DX099	So just the dd bit
2012-10-17T21:05:00.000Z	theadmin	DX099	It doesn't hurt anything if you do the isohybrid, though, but just saying
2012-10-17T21:05:00.000Z	DX099	theadmin	in case the regular dd thing won't work, I'll try it
2012-10-17T21:05:00.000Z	theadmin	DX099	It works with 12.04, I tested it, um, a week ago.
2012-10-17T21:06:00.000Z	theadmin	DX099	Dunno about 12.10, but if any logic works then it should
2012-10-17T21:06:00.000Z	DX099	theadmin	ok
2012-10-18T21:07:00.000Z	theadmin	DX099	You don't have to, but it is a good idea as you won't get updates for such software anymore
2012-10-18T21:08:00.000Z	DX099	theadmin	is the "Y-my-ppa" (or smth like) software a good way to do so ,
2012-10-18T21:08:00.000Z	theadmin	DX099	Not even sure what that is
2012-10-18T21:09:00.000Z	theadmin	DX099	You can use ppa-purge to remove PPAs and simply use apt-get to remove software
2012-10-18T21:09:00.000Z	theadmin	DX099	Oh, good to hear
2012-10-18T21:10:00.000Z	DX099	theadmin	I know but how do I check which software comes from ppa and so on ?
2012-10-18T21:11:00.000Z	theadmin	DX099	I'm not too sure of that.
2012-10-18T21:11:00.000Z	DX099	theadmin	ok, I'll just try with synaptic
2012-10-21T16:38:00.000Z	theadmin	DX099	And it can't %)
