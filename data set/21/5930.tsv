2007-07-06T07:23:00.000Z	Tonisius		is there a PHP version with CURL already enabled? if so, what package name is it, and in what repo. Been looking around as needed
2007-07-06T07:23:00.000Z	Tonisius		and it's not all good, but remember to exit when you are done
2007-07-06T07:24:00.000Z	Tonisius		most people go by "sudo <root_command>
2007-07-06T07:24:00.000Z	Tonisius		instead of being su'd all the time
2007-07-06T07:24:00.000Z	Tonisius		no one ever does it, it's not how the ubuntu design works
2007-07-06T07:24:00.000Z	Tonisius		sudo rm foldername
2007-07-06T07:25:00.000Z	Tonisius		my laptop uses vista...
2007-07-06T07:26:00.000Z	Tonisius		it's overprotective... can't blame them really..
2007-07-06T07:26:00.000Z	Tonisius		it's like blaming mommy for not letting my watch porn at 10 years old
2007-07-06T07:27:00.000Z	Tonisius		the only thing is, i don't want to be treated like i'm ten, when i'm 23 years old
2007-07-06T07:27:00.000Z	CarinArr	Tonisius	can't you dual boot the laptop?
2007-07-06T07:27:00.000Z	Tonisius	CarinArr	company laptop, can't do that
2007-07-06T07:27:00.000Z	CarinArr	Tonisius	i obviously work for a nicer company
2007-07-06T07:27:00.000Z	Tonisius	CarinArr	yes you do
2007-07-06T07:28:00.000Z	Tonisius	CarinArr	my side business requires performance, and to be cheap, linux is the way to go on my servers
2007-07-06T07:28:00.000Z	CarinArr	Tonisius	your company actually supports vista? mine is well off that point
2007-07-06T07:28:00.000Z	Tonisius	CarinArr	i don't support it, if that matters? they buy the hardware., and expect us to use them
2007-07-06T07:29:00.000Z	CarinArr	Tonisius	i just meant a lot of companies still tell people not to get vista because it's still got crap software support
2007-07-06T07:29:00.000Z	Tonisius	CarinArr	yeah, a bit off topic, but this channel is very... disorienting...
2007-07-06T07:30:00.000Z	Tonisius	CarinArr	i'm used to seeing more people that know how to ask a question.
2007-07-06T07:32:00.000Z	CarinArr	Tonisius	you normally get the non-noobs in +1 talking about pre-release;)
