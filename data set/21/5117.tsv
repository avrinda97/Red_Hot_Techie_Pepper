2008-01-12T18:52:00.000Z	pete1	Ziroda1	usb detects only printer which works ok
2008-01-12T18:52:00.000Z	Ziroda1	pete1	usually hp printers are well supported in linix as hp has pledged and does write drivers for them
2008-01-12T18:53:00.000Z	pete1	Ziroda1	yea, printer is suported with np, but scanner on MFP is problem
2008-01-12T18:58:00.000Z	pete1	Ziroda1	yea, i am on that part atm (scanner) :) and is damn hard
2008-01-12T18:59:00.000Z	Ziroda1	pete1	well i can give you a guide but no promises it will work, and you will probably have latter issues with ubuntu
2008-01-12T18:59:00.000Z	Ziroda1	pete1	heres a guide http://www.nabble.com/sane-driver-for-hp-laserjet-m1005-mfp-to12469670.html
2008-01-12T19:02:00.000Z	pete1	Ziroda1	yes i was trying that but no luck yet, i contacted mr santiago and he send me some updates, but still no luck with it
