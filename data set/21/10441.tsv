2005-03-29T15:10:00.000Z	Marble2		you know how in windows when you're browsing the web you can have it so mouse3 brings up the little thing so you can just move your mouse to scroll?

2005-03-29T15:10:00.000Z	Marble2		and how do I make mouse 4 and mouse 5 back and forward

2005-03-29T15:27:00.000Z	spades	Marble2	go to run application and type gnome-session-properties
2005-03-29T15:28:00.000Z	Marble2	spades	I don't see a checkbox for that
2005-03-29T15:30:00.000Z	spades	Marble2	if it isnt the 3rd checkbox then i dont know where to set it, try a normal logout and dont save the session and see if it defaults it
