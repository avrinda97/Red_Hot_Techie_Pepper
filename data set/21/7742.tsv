2009-06-14T21:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lucian	Puppy Linux and Damn Small Linux would probably be faster on older hardware, because they are specifically made for old hardware
2009-06-14T21:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lucian	I think XFCE is being worked on though, at being even better on old hardware
2009-06-14T21:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lucian	Konqueror is good
2009-06-14T21:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lucian	just the rendering enginge isn't worked on that much anymore :(
2009-06-14T22:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lucian	a lot of Windows games can get working pretty well in Wine.  GNU/Linux also has good native games out there
2009-06-14T22:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lucian	I don't care that much since not an op, but  your being off topic here and so you may want to join #ubuntu-offtopic
