2009-04-10T22:59:00.000Z	[MindVirus]	mib_p0ul5tsv	there are different forms of editing. You want to edit a text file?
2009-04-10T22:59:00.000Z	mib_p0ul5tsv	[MindVirus]	: it is a txt file
2009-04-10T22:59:00.000Z	[MindVirus]	mib_p0ul5tsv	use the root console, and then use a console-based text editor, like nano or vi.
2009-04-10T23:00:00.000Z	mib_p0ul5tsv	[MindVirus]	the problem is i edited the xorg.conf file and need to no the code
2009-04-10T23:01:00.000Z	[MindVirus]	mib_p0ul5tsv	so open up a root console from recovery mode and nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-04-10T23:01:00.000Z	mib_p0ul5tsv	[MindVirus]	 thanks going to try now
2009-04-10T23:05:00.000Z	[MindVirus]	mib_p0ul5tsv	Xorg can run without xorg.conf.
2009-04-10T23:05:00.000Z	mib_p0ul5tsv	[MindVirus]	 the problem is , i edited and well it went bad ways,
2009-04-10T23:06:00.000Z	[MindVirus]	mib_p0ul5tsv	of course. That's the only thing that can possibly happen. :)
2009-04-10T23:07:00.000Z	mib_p0ul5tsv	[MindVirus]	 i cant login due to me editing the main file but i look at it now  and well, it looks fine :S the layout is the same as before
2009-04-10T23:07:00.000Z	[MindVirus]	mib_p0ul5tsv	you shouldn't need to login from the root prompt.
2009-04-10T23:08:00.000Z	mib_p0ul5tsv	[MindVirus]	 im on, PC not my laptop were ubuntu is on
2009-04-10T23:08:00.000Z	[MindVirus]	mib_p0ul5tsv	I don't understand the problem.
2009-04-10T23:09:00.000Z	mib_p0ul5tsv	[MindVirus]	 i edited the xorg.conf file and its messed up my Display, meanig everying is like, not showing
2009-04-10T23:09:00.000Z	[MindVirus]	mib_p0ul5tsv	right, so after you've backed it up, rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-04-10T23:10:00.000Z	mib_p0ul5tsv	[MindVirus]	 heres the thing, i dont have one, thats why i ask if someone nice enought to paste there
2009-04-10T23:10:00.000Z	mib_p0ul5tsv	[MindVirus]	 no
2009-04-10T23:10:00.000Z	[MindVirus]	mib_p0ul5tsv	here's the thing though -- X should run without an xorg.conf.
2009-04-10T23:11:00.000Z	mib_p0ul5tsv	[MindVirus]	seems not in this case, it has, well messed up, could this be due to the ubuntu 9.04 beta ?
2009-04-10T23:12:00.000Z	[MindVirus]	mib_p0ul5tsv	problems in 9.04 should be asked in #ubuntu+1.
