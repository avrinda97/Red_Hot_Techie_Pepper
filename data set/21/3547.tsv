2008-11-28T13:11:00.000Z	N-A		I have a problem mounting a partition (with ntfs-3g) I get the message that I must be root to mount xxx in yyy, this is one of several ntfs partitions, the rest mount fine.
2008-11-28T13:11:00.000Z	Guest34521	N-A	sudo
2008-11-28T13:12:00.000Z	N-A	Guest34521	I would like a general fix, not a one shot
2008-11-28T13:12:00.000Z	Guest34521	N-A	yes
2008-11-28T13:12:00.000Z	N-A	Guest34521	Yes?
2008-11-28T13:12:00.000Z	Guest34521	N-A	http://www.ntfs-3g.org/
2008-11-28T13:12:00.000Z	N-A	Guest34521	Like, I want nautilus to mount it when I double click on it and umount when I tell it to unmount
2008-11-28T13:13:00.000Z	Guest34521	N-A	oh I don't know how to force nautilus to use root either, ask around
2008-11-28T13:15:00.000Z	N-A	Guest34521	I don't want nautilus to have to sudo to do it either... the rest of the mount/unmount of ntfs partitions in nautilus works, just not for that one partition
2008-11-28T13:16:00.000Z	Guest34521	N-A	hmm weird is it ntfs internal just like the others ?
2008-11-28T13:16:00.000Z	N-A	Guest34521	Yeah, it's "the same"
2008-11-28T13:16:00.000Z	N-A	Guest34521	Also USB automounting of NTFS partitions work fine as well
2008-11-28T13:17:00.000Z	Guest34521	N-A	then it could be a bug no ?
2008-11-28T13:18:00.000Z	N-A	Guest34521	I checked the rights on the mount point, and the dev, they all appear to be exactly the same
2008-11-28T13:18:00.000Z	Guest34521	N-A	yes I understand so if everything works fine it's either that special partition which is faulty which I don't get what would be wrong :9
2008-11-28T13:19:00.000Z	N-A	Guest34521	Yeah I also booted windows to chkdsk several times
2008-11-28T13:21:00.000Z	N-A	Guest34521	And also if I do sudo mount it works fine
2008-11-28T13:21:00.000Z	N-A	Guest34521	Then I have to sudo to umount as well
2008-11-28T13:22:00.000Z	Guest34521	N-A	oh so then it must be a nautilus problem I guess, probably a bug I really don't know
2008-11-28T13:22:00.000Z	N-A	Guest34521	Well, I can's just mount it in a terminal either
2008-11-28T13:22:00.000Z	N-A	Guest34521	I have to sudo to mount it
