2009-11-04T08:51:00.000Z	Devastator	obiwan_	can i give you an example?
2009-11-04T08:52:00.000Z	Devastator	obiwan_	dd-wrt is a open-source firmware for linksys routers mostly and has 20gb of source, imagine how much time you will need to compile 20gb of files and transform it in 4mb :P
2009-11-04T08:53:00.000Z	obiwan_	Devastator	do you know how big is the source for ubuntuÂ¿ haha
2009-11-04T08:53:00.000Z	Devastator	obiwan_	much bigger than 20gb, for sure
2009-11-04T08:53:00.000Z	obiwan_	Devastator	if 20 g = 4mb, 600 mb= ..... 30 terabytes? haha
2009-11-04T08:54:00.000Z	Devastator	obiwan_	20g of source, doesn't mean that all will be used
2009-11-04T08:55:00.000Z	Devastator	obiwan_	but was just an example, you can't compare, perhaps ubuntu source isn't bigger than dd-wrt
2009-11-04T08:56:00.000Z	Devastator	obiwan_	what some really advanced linux users do is to compile their own distro
2009-11-04T08:57:00.000Z	obiwan_	Devastator	yeah, i read about that i was interested in making my own one, but it's way hard, i don't know aobut system modules, sound modules and all that
2009-11-04T08:57:00.000Z	Devastator	obiwan_	i suggest you to learn how to compile kernel first, it's a big step
2009-11-04T08:57:00.000Z	obiwan_	Devastator	you just have to do a ls /lib/modules, and you'll see how many modules are there, if i had to choose each one i'd go mad haha
2009-11-04T08:58:00.000Z	obiwan_	Devastator	i was told compiling kernel is for kiddies, and that there are much mor eimportant things to do than building kernels, so i left it . Anyway i don't know anything about kernels, i just know it's the os brain
2009-11-04T08:59:00.000Z	Devastator	obiwan_	i used to compile kernels for myself, that can make system lighter, but it's just one variable :P
2009-11-04T09:00:00.000Z	Devastator	obiwan_	i don't know yet how to make a good kernel, but a basic one is easy
2009-11-04T09:01:00.000Z	obiwan_	Devastator	but there's so many options in compiling kernel, i wouldn't know which one to choose in each step, a really really step by step, option by option guide would be awesome , if i find one anyday i may try to compile it
2009-11-04T09:02:00.000Z	Devastator	obiwan_	if i remember correctly it's: tar -zxvf linux-VERSION-HERE.tar.gz && make menuconfig, then select modules and stuff, save, make dep, make clean, make, make install
2009-11-04T09:03:00.000Z	obiwan_	Devastator	yeah but thre are many things to choose from Devastator
2009-11-04T09:04:00.000Z	Devastator	obiwan_	don't you want to know unix? you need to know the devices first, you only know linux if you know devices
2009-11-04T09:04:00.000Z	obiwan_	Devastator	for example, i read one day that you can choose if the kernel will accept more than 4 gigs by changing an option in the kernel compilation, and there must be hundreds more options, i simply couldn't choose  i'm not an expert
2009-11-04T09:08:00.000Z	Devastator	obiwan_	i don't know if philh or syn-ack will agree but to compile a kernel you need to know a lot from your machine, chipset models, manufacturers etc, and not only from your machines, but machines in general
2009-11-04T09:09:00.000Z	obiwan_	Devastator	that's why i keep away from compiling by now
