2007-10-12T08:35:00.000Z	MasterShrek	cyrano	are you running 64 bit?
2007-10-12T08:36:00.000Z	MasterShrek	cyrano	try: export SAL_SYNCHRONIZE=1    and then try running again
2007-10-12T08:38:00.000Z	MasterShrek	cyrano	i only said to do that because it said to do that to help debugging, did you get different output now?
2007-10-12T08:38:00.000Z	cyrano	MasterShrek	just a little different. I'll paste it
2007-10-12T08:39:00.000Z	cyrano	MasterShrek	http://pastebin.ubuntu-nl.org/40387/
2007-10-12T08:40:00.000Z	MasterShrek	cyrano	and im assuming you dont have a very small amount of ram
2007-10-12T08:40:00.000Z	MasterShrek	cyrano	i would say its a problem with the package then
2007-10-12T08:42:00.000Z	MasterShrek	cyrano	have you tried reinstalling it?
2007-10-12T08:43:00.000Z	MasterShrek	cyrano	or synaptic
2007-10-12T08:46:00.000Z	cyrano	MasterShrek	should i mark for reinstallation or do a complete removal first in synaptic?
2007-10-12T08:47:00.000Z	MasterShrek	cyrano	up to you, i would completely remove then reinstall
2007-11-30T21:50:00.000Z	MasterShrek	cyrano	i dont know how well windows mobile interacts with linux
