2012-09-08T01:00:00.000Z	guntbert	guest9876765	step 1) mount -o rw,remount /
2012-09-08T01:01:00.000Z	guest9876765	guntbert	ok
2012-09-08T01:02:00.000Z	guest9876765	guntbert	this is the only tty i have, that means i have to leave irssi
2012-09-08T01:03:00.000Z	guest9876765	guntbert	am writting this in paper so i will do that
2012-09-08T01:03:00.000Z	guntbert	guest9876765	step 2) look into /etc/group
2012-09-08T01:03:00.000Z	guest9876765	guntbert	after i leave this chat
2012-09-08T01:03:00.000Z	guntbert	guest9876765	don't leave yet :)
2012-09-08T01:04:00.000Z	guest9876765	guntbert	ok, that i will look in to /etc/group
2012-09-08T01:04:00.000Z	guntbert	guest9876765	do you have a live CD from which you can boot?
2012-09-08T01:05:00.000Z	guest9876765	guntbert	i think so, i have to look for, this is a direct install, is not a vmware
2012-09-08T01:06:00.000Z	guntbert	guest9876765	I was asking because the next steps depend on what really happened in your system - so it will be much easier (for both of us :-)) fi you can look for yourself at the page I told you about
2012-09-08T01:08:00.000Z	guest9876765	guntbert	i know, but since i have no browser, heh, hmm i need to make my user into /etc/sudoers file, if i only can do that then i normal boot and sudo su and do all the stuff
2012-09-08T01:08:00.000Z	guntbert	guest9876765	thats why I suggested using a live CD
2012-09-08T01:09:00.000Z	guest9876765	guntbert	am gone try mount rw / and try to write into /etc/soduers, see what happend
2012-09-08T01:10:00.000Z	guntbert	guest9876765	Good luck!
