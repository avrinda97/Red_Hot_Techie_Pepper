2008-04-18T12:17:00.000Z	bazhang	PeterParkerSubZ1	this is a support channel; best to take chat to #ubuntu-offtopic thanks
2008-04-18T12:19:00.000Z	bazhang	PeterParkerSubZ1	what driver and how installed
2008-04-18T12:20:00.000Z	PeterParkerSubZ1	bazhang	err driver? I tried to download one from the site and it didnt offer linux so I just went with the defaults in ubuntu
2008-04-18T12:22:00.000Z	bazhang	PeterParkerSubZ1	the restricted driver? from the restricted driver manager? or the one from nvidia site (they do have a linux driver btw)
2008-04-18T12:22:00.000Z	PeterParkerSubZ1	bazhang	I'll check it out once again...
2008-04-18T12:29:00.000Z	PeterParkerSubZ1	bazhang	It's not letting me install
2008-04-18T12:29:00.000Z	PeterParkerSubZ1	bazhang	It's says it must run as root when I chose to run it in terminal ... then I hit run and it does nothing
2008-04-18T12:30:00.000Z	bazhang	PeterParkerSubZ1	with the sudo command?
2008-04-18T12:31:00.000Z	PeterParkerSubZ1	bazhang	That's what happened last time too ... so I mispoke they have the driver it just wont let me install
2008-04-18T12:31:00.000Z	PeterParkerSubZ1	bazhang	I'm a newb I don't know how to do that
2008-04-18T12:31:00.000Z	PeterParkerSubZ1	bazhang	I have the terminal open
2008-04-18T12:32:00.000Z	bazhang	PeterParkerSubZ1	are you in the same directory as the file you want to install? you then to need add sudo in front of the command you give and then supply your user password
2008-04-18T12:33:00.000Z	PeterParkerSubZ1	bazhang	I saved the file from nvidia to the desktop, but I don't know any commands
2008-04-18T12:33:00.000Z	PeterParkerSubZ1	bazhang	I just got off windows two days ago
2008-04-18T12:33:00.000Z	PeterParkerSubZ1	bazhang	Sorry for my lack of know how
2008-04-18T12:33:00.000Z	bazhang	PeterParkerSubZ1	before you do that; have you the drivers installed in the restricted drivers manager? enabled and in use?
2008-04-18T12:33:00.000Z	PeterParkerSubZ1	bazhang	I'm much better with windows, not that that would do me much here
2008-04-18T12:38:00.000Z	PeterParkerSubZ1	bazhang	I'm attempting to install them now ... it's going through the motions
2008-04-18T12:39:00.000Z	bazhang	PeterParkerSubZ1	please check the restricted drivers manager first
