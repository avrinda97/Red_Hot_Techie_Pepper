2010-10-21T08:37:00.000Z	Makkar		I would have to disagree with that frostbyt3..  with windows 7, its alot more user friendly than any previous windows..  and its rock solid stable..  my record on my rig is 43 days uptime in windows7..and I been running it since it was released and have yet to have it crash because of the os..  ive crashed it overclocking my rig a little too far.. lol  but i have yet to have a single issue with win7
2010-10-21T08:37:00.000Z	Makkar		check your hardware
2010-10-21T08:38:00.000Z	Makkar		i havent seen a blue screen yet that wasnt a direct result of me pushin my hardware too far
2010-10-21T08:38:00.000Z	Makkar		yes...if you wanted to game on a pc, ya gotta roll whatever mr gates is tellin us to roll
2010-10-21T08:39:00.000Z	Makkar		for what its worth, I could just run ubuntu in vmware, but I wanted to experience it without that overhead...
2010-10-21T08:41:00.000Z	Makkar		I have a pretty beastly rig..  nothing kills this beast.. lol
2010-10-21T08:41:00.000Z	Makkar		but I do know what you mean.. os x runs kinda like crap on vmware as well
2010-10-21T08:42:00.000Z	Makkar		yeah it is until you start doing heavy video editing and shit
2010-10-21T08:43:00.000Z	Makkar		actually I kinda am jealous... my favorite times are the old celeron 300a days.. the games during that era were just way funner than anything out these days
2010-10-21T08:44:00.000Z	Baribal	Makkar	there's always the option of writing your own... :)
2010-10-21T08:44:00.000Z	Makkar		nah.. im an old hippy stoner.. that boat sailed back in the days of basic on my old color computer   =o)
2010-10-21T08:45:00.000Z	Baribal	Makkar	did you ever try coding... on weed? </half-baked-reference>
2010-10-21T08:46:00.000Z	Makkar		no it cant.. at least not natively that I know of
2010-10-21T08:46:00.000Z	Makkar		heh good movie.. and yes.. Ihave
2010-10-21T08:47:00.000Z	Makkar		sadly all I coded that night was a stick figure running across the screen back on my coco3
2010-10-21T08:48:00.000Z	Makkar		so what are some other flavors that are worth checkin out ?
2010-10-21T08:50:00.000Z	Baribal	Makkar	until about a month ago, all I coded game-wise was back on my MSX. Now my chessboard is about half-finished.
2010-10-21T08:51:00.000Z	Makkar	Baribal	yeah I havent done any coding since basic.. back in the mid 80's..  well I cant say that.. I did some coding in OS/9 on my coco around the same time.. but that was more copy and paste out of a magazine.. lol
2010-10-21T08:52:00.000Z	Baribal	Makkar	well, checkout and build Crystal Space, read the official Python tutorial, ask a few questions and you're good to go. :D
2010-10-21T08:54:00.000Z	Makkar		ooh.. crystal space looks interesting
2010-10-21T08:56:00.000Z	Baribal	Makkar	it is. It has a few kinks, but, you know, OSS, we're working on it. :D
