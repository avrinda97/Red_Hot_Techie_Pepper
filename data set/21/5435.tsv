2008-04-25T02:20:00.000Z	Zicks		can someone tell me why emerald wont change themes ?
2008-04-25T02:20:00.000Z	maco	Zicks	emerald is dead
2008-04-25T03:34:00.000Z	maco	Zicks	because it's dead
2008-04-25T03:34:00.000Z	Zicks	maco	dead ?
2008-04-25T03:34:00.000Z	maco	Zicks	emerald is for beryl.  beryl is gone.
2008-04-25T03:35:00.000Z	maco	Zicks	it can work with compiz, but its really flaky, and the compiz team no longer supports its continued existence
2008-04-25T03:35:00.000Z	maco	Zicks	gtk-window-decorator or the kde one
2008-04-25T03:35:00.000Z	maco	Zicks	they use normal gnome and kde themes
2008-04-25T03:36:00.000Z	maco	Zicks	the compiz team is considering making a new window decorator, but it hasnt been decided yet
2008-04-25T03:37:00.000Z	maco	Zicks	compiz gets transparency on the metacity themes when you use gtk-window-decorator now, and transparency was all emerald had going for it
2008-04-25T03:37:00.000Z	maco	Zicks	ok fine, emerald's theme manager had a nice way of editing/creating themes too...
2008-04-25T03:38:00.000Z	maco	Zicks	you *can* use emerald if you like...ive done so...but its a piece of crap.  compizquinn told me its a pile of spaghetti code
2008-04-25T03:38:00.000Z	maco	Zicks	it should be there
2008-04-25T03:38:00.000Z	maco	Zicks	its what automatically does window deocrations when you use compiz
2008-04-25T03:39:00.000Z	maco	Zicks	yep
2008-04-25T03:39:00.000Z	maco	Zicks	install them in your normal gnome theme thingy and compiz automatically adds transparency
2008-04-25T03:39:00.000Z	Zicks	maco	thanks for your help
2008-04-25T03:40:00.000Z	Zicks	maco	where can i find the hardy heron release notes ?
2008-04-25T03:40:00.000Z	maco	Zicks	good question. i dont know. ...ive been using it so long ive had no reason to look. i can link you to the new features page...
