2010-10-31T09:18:00.000Z	blackshirt		hi huntz23..
2010-10-31T09:18:00.000Z	andresmh		how do I tell launchpad that this bug is still active in Maverick  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pulseaudio/+bug/409819
2010-10-31T09:20:00.000Z	blackshirt	andresmh	your problem with microphone, is that right ??
2010-10-31T09:20:00.000Z	andresmh	blackshirt	sigh... yeah
2010-10-31T09:20:00.000Z	andresmh	blackshirt	i reported it back in aug 2009
2010-10-31T09:21:00.000Z	blackshirt		wow, it was a year ago .. :)
2010-10-31T09:22:00.000Z	blackshirt	andresmh	are you sure have enable it on volume control panel ??
2010-10-31T09:23:00.000Z	andresmh		yeah, blackshirt, honestly i'm quite tired of not being able to use my mic and webcam in ubuntu... since then, Win 7 has gotten much better.
2010-10-31T09:23:00.000Z	andresmh	blackshirt	i am, but i can check again
2010-10-31T09:24:00.000Z	andresmh	blackshirt	yeah, Sound Prefereces look just like they looked back in 2009 http://img139.imageshack.us/img139/7273/soundissues.png
2010-10-31T09:24:00.000Z	blackshirt		andresmh:ok, i check it
2010-10-31T09:25:00.000Z	andresmh	blackshirt	basically, i think it should show two devices for sound input, "Internal Audio Analog Stereo" (which I believe is the jack where you can connect a mic) and another one for the mic that is on the chasis of the laptop
2010-10-31T09:29:00.000Z	blackshirt		andreshmh: all of them not functioning
2010-10-31T09:30:00.000Z	andresmh	blackshirt	last time I checked (6 months ago), connecting an external mic to the jack worked. I don't have one at hand to test now though.
2010-10-31T09:31:00.000Z	andresmh	blackshirt	do you know what's the command to send more info to launchpad to update that bug?
2010-10-31T09:34:00.000Z	blackshirt	andresmh	maybe you can use reportbug utility
2010-10-31T09:34:00.000Z	andresmh	blackshirt	yup, found it and updated https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pulseaudio/+bug/409819
2010-10-31T09:36:00.000Z	andresmh	blackshirt	too bad linux still hasn't figured out how to deal with hardware nicely. Perhaps it's the manufacturer's fault but still.. you'd think 3 year old hardware would work out of the box.
