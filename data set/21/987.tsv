2011-12-12T03:54:00.000Z	keithclark		I created a link to a directory in my /home directory.  I can access it fine when I'm on the physical machine but when I try and access it via ftp, it gives me an "This link cannot be used, because its target "/media/f8a84f74-ec09-4912-bb46-bd176c7777d7/Videos" doesn't exist." error.  I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong here.
2011-12-12T03:55:00.000Z	brightspark	keithclark	is it a symbolic link or a hard link?
2011-12-12T03:56:00.000Z	keithclark	brightspark	I created it in nautilus via 'make link'
2011-12-12T03:57:00.000Z	keithclark	brightspark	I assume that would be a symbolic link?
2011-12-12T03:58:00.000Z	brightspark	keithclark	I'm not sure; currently trying to figure it out.  I typically use the terminal to do file manipulation.
2011-12-12T03:59:00.000Z	brightspark	keithclark	you are correct.  You could see if you get the same behaviour from a hard link.
2011-12-12T04:00:00.000Z	brightspark	keithclark	use the command "ln" in the terminal to make a hardlink (it will do symbolic links iff you use the "--symbolic" flag).
2011-12-12T04:00:00.000Z	keithclark	brightspark	yes, researching now
2011-12-12T04:02:00.000Z	keithclark	brightspark	hmm, 'hard link not allowed'
2011-12-12T04:04:00.000Z	brightspark	keithclark	you are trying to link to a file on another partition.  I'm not sure how to make that work.  Here is a thought- are you certain the partition is mounted in /media when you try to access it remotely?
2011-12-12T04:05:00.000Z	keithclark	brightspark	yes, mounted fine
2011-12-12T04:07:00.000Z	brightspark	keithclark	Is your FTP set up to allow access to places other than the home directory?  It may be a security feature preventing you from accessing files you are not permitted to.
2011-12-12T04:08:00.000Z	keithclark	brightspark	ahh, this might be, not sure
2011-12-12T04:10:00.000Z	brightspark	keithclark	can you access ".." ie the directory level up in FTP?
2011-12-12T04:13:00.000Z	keithclark	brightspark	no, I cannot
2011-12-12T04:15:00.000Z	brightspark	keithclark	look up "ftpchroot".  It sounds like the tool you need.
2011-12-12T04:20:00.000Z	keithclark	brightspark	could it be because I've not modified my fstab for this drive?
2011-12-12T04:21:00.000Z	brightspark	keithclark	If stuff is mounting correctly I doubt it, I think FTP's security is simply denying you access to anything outside of your home directory.
2011-12-12T04:21:00.000Z	keithclark	brightspark	I believe that there is a settings file for that, no?
2011-12-12T04:22:00.000Z	brightspark	keithclark	I think you need to enable access to /media by using ftpchroot or similar.
