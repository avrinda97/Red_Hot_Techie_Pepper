2006-08-22T16:22:00.000Z	Zonoid		My laptop's external cd-rom drive is conflicing with Ubuntu booting from the live cd. Is there anything I can do about this?
2006-08-22T16:24:00.000Z	Zonoid		Ubuntu cannot mount the CD from my external cd-rom drive on my laptop. Is there anything I can do to fix this?
2006-08-22T16:24:00.000Z	Zonoid		BrandonThe: It looks like you're having my same problem!
2006-08-22T16:25:00.000Z	Zonoid		Lassegs: Not exactly. It looks like it had to do with my CD-rom drive the whole time.
2006-08-22T16:25:00.000Z	Zonoid		For awhile I thought I fixed it.
2006-08-22T16:25:00.000Z	Zonoid		Lassegs: Yes. My laptop doesn't have one built in.
2006-08-22T16:26:00.000Z	Zonoid		Lassegs: Do you know if it's possible to download the distro on the computer and install it on that same system?
2006-08-22T16:27:00.000Z	Zonoid		Is it possible to download Ubuntu and install it on the same system you downloaded it to?
2006-08-22T16:27:00.000Z	Ademan	Zonoid	of course, but you have to burn it to a cd of course
2006-08-22T16:28:00.000Z	Ademan	Zonoid	you can't boot from a usb device? my BIOS supports that...
2006-08-22T16:29:00.000Z	Ademan	Zonoid	so your computer is just a bunch of USB ports? :-p
2006-08-22T16:29:00.000Z	Zonoid	Ademan	Basically :-)
2006-08-22T16:29:00.000Z	Ademan	Zonoid	well there's got to be a way, but I wouldn't know, i'm not a boot master
2006-08-22T16:30:00.000Z	Ademan	Zonoid	check that the ISO has the right checksum
2006-08-22T16:30:00.000Z	Zonoid	Ademan	How do you check that?
2006-08-22T16:30:00.000Z	Ademan	Zonoid	under windows? i don't know google for md5 checksum
2006-08-22T16:31:00.000Z	Ademan	Zonoid	and then compare what it outputs to what it says on the download page
2006-08-22T16:31:00.000Z	Ademan	Zonoid	and you burned it as an iso not a file to the cd right?
2006-08-22T16:31:00.000Z	Zonoid	Ademan	Yes. It boots on another computer.
2006-08-22T16:32:00.000Z	Zonoid	Ademan	I think the checksum is fine, because it boots on another computer.
2006-08-22T16:32:00.000Z	Ademan	Zonoid	probably
