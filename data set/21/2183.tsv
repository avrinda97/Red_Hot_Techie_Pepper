2009-12-20T23:50:00.000Z	dath	Kane	just try it out, its easy
2009-12-20T23:51:00.000Z	dath	Kane	it comes preinstalled with ubuntu
2009-12-20T23:51:00.000Z	dath	Kane	there is also vlc for linux
2009-12-20T23:57:00.000Z	dath	Kane	just install via software center
2009-12-21T00:00:00.000Z	dath	Kane	 in applications menu the lowest entry
2009-12-21T00:02:00.000Z	dath	Kane	you might also need ubuntu restricted extras, also from software center
2009-12-21T00:02:00.000Z	dath	Kane	its required to play mp3 and some closed formats
2009-12-21T00:03:00.000Z	dath	Kane	just use the search field to find ubuntu restricted extras and vlc
2009-12-21T00:06:00.000Z	Kane	dath	what shall i search for
2009-12-21T00:06:00.000Z	dath	Kane	vlc ad ubuntu restricted extras
2009-12-21T00:19:00.000Z	dath	Kane	it does, im listening to mp3 right now ;) all you need is to install that restricted extras package, then all programs who support mp3 can play it. it just isnt being shipped with ubuntu because of legal restrictions so you have to install it before you can listen to mp3s
2009-12-21T00:21:00.000Z	dath	Kane	that command does the same as installing restricted extras via the software center.
2009-12-21T00:23:00.000Z	dath	Kane	why do you want to stream it? i thought u want to listen to mp3 files
2009-12-21T00:23:00.000Z	dath	Kane	do you want to convert a cd to mp3 files or what?
2009-12-21T00:24:00.000Z	dath	Kane	 just open the file like any other file, the default program will open and play it. you can open it with other programs by right clicking
2009-12-21T00:31:00.000Z	dath	Kane	just open the file with vlc
2009-12-21T00:33:00.000Z	dath	Kane	is the volume bar near the clock up?
2009-12-21T00:33:00.000Z	dath	Kane	did you install ubuntu restricted extras
2009-12-21T00:35:00.000Z	dath	Kane	did you try right clicking the file and choosing vlc?
