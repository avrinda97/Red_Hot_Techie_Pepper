2006-08-25T12:23:00.000Z	jake1		why cnt my wireless card just freaking work
2006-08-25T12:23:00.000Z	Warbo	jake1	What type is it? Maybe the manufacturer doesn't want you to use it
2006-08-25T12:23:00.000Z	Warbo		!wifi
2006-08-25T12:23:00.000Z	jake1	Warbo	no other peopl have this same machine and got it to work
2006-08-25T12:23:00.000Z	jake1		but seemingly i cnt
2006-08-25T12:24:00.000Z	jake1	Warbo	i looked there, but they are just telling me to get the ndiswrapper-source
2006-08-25T12:24:00.000Z	jake1		and i cnt get it
2006-08-25T12:24:00.000Z	jake1		i've looked everywhere
2006-08-25T12:24:00.000Z	Warbo	jake1	Ndiswrapper? Looks like your manufacturer doesn't want you to use it
2006-08-25T12:25:00.000Z	jake1		warbo: my manufacturer is broadcom and many people with the same card have gotten it to work
2006-08-25T12:25:00.000Z	jake1		that does not address the reason why ndiswrapper is not listed in synaptic
2006-08-25T12:25:00.000Z	Warbo	jake1	ndiswrapper is a hack, and I haven't used it myself. I went with RaLink, who have a driver in the kernel by default
