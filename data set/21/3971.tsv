2008-08-09T08:16:00.000Z	Ryan_Macy	Scorp__	I don't think so, you should have the latest version
2008-08-09T08:17:00.000Z	Scorp__	Ryan_Macy	Yeah, but the page isn't loading properly cuz of the javascript thing which it was in OpenSUSE... Is javascript OS Dependent or browser dependent ???
2008-08-09T08:17:00.000Z	Ryan_Macy	Scorp__	well browsers tend to handle things differently
2008-08-09T08:17:00.000Z	Scorp__	Ryan_Macy	yeah...
2008-08-09T08:19:00.000Z	Scorp__	Ryan_Macy	It says Expected ":" but found ";" - Declaration Dropped
2008-08-09T08:21:00.000Z	Ryan_Macy	Scorp__	http://www.dslreports.com/faq/8756
2008-08-09T08:21:00.000Z	Scorp__	Ryan_Macy	I've done that... I guess it runs diff scripts for linux and windows as per what i saw in HTTPFox... So that could be a reason for the typo error in this script and not for other OS..
2008-08-09T08:22:00.000Z	Ryan_Macy	Scorp__	its possible that the HTTPFox browser handles things more strictly than say ie6
2008-08-09T08:22:00.000Z	Scorp__	Ryan_Macy	umm, quite possible.. but on windows n OpenSUSe i was use firefox only.. not IE
2008-08-09T08:23:00.000Z	Scorp__	Ryan_Macy	as in ?? i've been using ff always, but this error has been there only on ubuntu all the time.. Not first time...
2008-08-09T08:24:00.000Z	Scorp__	Ryan_Macy	It hasnt worked there too...
2008-08-09T08:25:00.000Z	Scorp__	Ryan_Macy	installed ff2 specially on ubuntu even though its 8.04
2008-08-09T08:25:00.000Z	Scorp__	Ryan_Macy	are there any other browsers other than ff and opera ???
2008-08-09T08:25:00.000Z	Ryan_Macy	Scorp__	yes
2008-08-09T08:27:00.000Z	Ryan_Macy	Scorp__	it sounds like your router bud
2008-08-09T08:28:00.000Z	Scorp__	Ryan_Macy	But the same browsers are working on other OS and working perfectly flawless..
2008-08-09T08:28:00.000Z	Scorp__	Ryan_Macy	tried opera on XP the other day and it worked.
2008-08-09T08:28:00.000Z	Ryan_Macy	Scorp__	you should have said that lol
2008-08-09T08:29:00.000Z	Scorp__	Ryan_Macy	lol.. I told ya.. yeah, i did that too... infact got the stupid xulrunner error too... was without a browser for a day... haha
2008-08-09T08:29:00.000Z	Ryan_Macy	Scorp__	got java installed?
2008-08-09T08:29:00.000Z	Scorp__	Ryan_Macy	Sun Java 6
