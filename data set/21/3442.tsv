2009-03-25T04:59:00.000Z	Jan`		Yeah they have like four times the return rate of XP.
2009-03-25T05:00:00.000Z	Jan`		This eee was sold with windows on it.
2009-03-25T05:01:00.000Z	Jan`		I know people who have those
2009-03-25T05:01:00.000Z	Jan`		It's a bit crappy
2009-03-25T05:02:00.000Z	Jan`		There should be less distros.
2009-03-25T05:02:00.000Z	Jan`		the only reason I even have anything to do with these things is that there's a specific version of ubuntu for it
2009-03-25T05:03:00.000Z	Jan`		Choice is fine but linux has choice to the point that it's totally fragmented, and that's a pain in the ass.
2009-03-25T05:04:00.000Z	Jan`		there's like 1001 places for config files to be, and in each of those, there's 1001 config files.
2009-03-25T05:05:00.000Z	Jan`		the way linux does config is just a *disaster*.
2009-03-25T05:05:00.000Z	wolter	Jan`	common.. please reconsider saying that.
2009-03-25T05:05:00.000Z	wolter	Jan`	in case you didn't know, ubuntu has a 'registry' as well.
2009-03-25T05:06:00.000Z	wolter	Jan`	what setting do you want to change? I'll help you.
2009-03-25T05:06:00.000Z	Jan`	wolter	Whatever one it is that makes networking not work in a complicated way.
2009-03-25T05:07:00.000Z	wolter	Jan`	what do you mean? do you have no internet?
2009-03-25T05:07:00.000Z	Jan`	wolter	The issue is that the ee can see the internet, but not other XP machines on the LAN.
2009-03-25T05:08:00.000Z	wolter	Jan`	do you have samba installed?
2009-03-25T05:08:00.000Z	Jan`	wolter	Yes, but it works sometimes, then stops working.
2009-03-25T05:09:00.000Z	wolter	Jan`	I must admit, samba support is not excellent--distant from being excellent, but it might work sometimes.
2009-03-25T05:09:00.000Z	Jan`	wolter	We noticed.
2009-03-25T05:09:00.000Z	wolter	Jan`	well, why don't you use lanshark, or ftp?
