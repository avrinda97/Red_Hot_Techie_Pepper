2006-04-01T10:03:00.000Z	niki		how do i change the behavior of my title bars, so when i double click them, they shade, instead of maximizing?
2006-04-01T10:03:00.000Z	_jason	niki	system > preferences > windows iirc
2006-04-01T10:04:00.000Z	niki	_jason	that would be it, thx :)
2006-04-02T07:22:00.000Z	_jason	niki	did you do an expert install?
2006-04-02T07:22:00.000Z	niki	_jason	no...and it's been working fine all day
2006-04-02T07:22:00.000Z	_jason	niki	strange, what is the output of 'groups'?
2006-04-02T07:22:00.000Z	niki	_jason	niki and audio
2006-04-02T07:23:00.000Z	_jason	niki	this is the user you created during the install process?
2006-04-02T07:23:00.000Z	niki	_jason	yes
2006-04-02T07:23:00.000Z	_jason	niki	well somehow your user got removed from the admin group.  Users in the admin group are the only ones that can use sudo
2006-04-02T07:23:00.000Z	niki	_jason	how can i repair this?
2006-04-02T07:24:00.000Z	_jason	niki	did you ever set a root password by any chance?
2006-04-02T07:24:00.000Z	niki	_jason	nope, just gave the userpass that was asked for in the install
2006-04-02T07:25:00.000Z	_jason	niki	that's ok, you will have to do this: reboot and select 'recovery mode' from the grub menu.  Then when you get a root prompt, enter the command 'adduser your_normal_username admin', then reboot again and you should have sudo working again
2006-04-02T07:26:00.000Z	niki	_jason	ok, will give it a shot...thanks :)
2006-04-02T07:37:00.000Z	niki	_jason	your solution worked, i can use sudo now...thanks so much!
2006-04-02T07:37:00.000Z	_jason	niki	np
2006-04-04T08:34:00.000Z	_jason	niki	ls > /path/to/textfile
2006-04-04T09:10:00.000Z	_jason	niki	cat /proc/cpuinfo
2006-06-14T08:59:00.000Z	_jason	niki	if your kernel got upgraded, yes
