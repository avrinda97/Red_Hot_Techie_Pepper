2005-09-03T11:04:00.000Z	brenner	Baskerville	if crimusn couldn't fix it .. i doubt these buggers would be able to :-/
2005-09-03T11:05:00.000Z	Baskerville	brenner	It did, but than he exited...
2005-09-03T11:05:00.000Z	Baskerville		I think he couldn't finish...
2005-09-03T11:05:00.000Z	Baskerville		... helping me
2005-09-03T11:05:00.000Z	Baskerville		Right now I have sound
2005-09-03T11:05:00.000Z	Baskerville		But the next time I start, maybe I won't
2005-09-03T11:05:00.000Z	brenner	Baskerville	ok...
2005-09-03T11:05:00.000Z	brenner	Baskerville	do you get system sounds?
2005-09-03T11:06:00.000Z	Baskerville	brenner	Yes, right now I have everything
2005-09-03T11:06:00.000Z	brenner	Baskerville	what about when you lose sound?
2005-09-03T11:07:00.000Z	Baskerville	brenner	Nothing. It tells me that there is no sound device and to execute "esd" in a console
2005-09-03T11:07:00.000Z	Baskerville		The sound icon has a red "X" over it
2005-09-03T11:07:00.000Z	brenner	Baskerville	and you do so?
2005-09-03T11:07:00.000Z	brenner	Baskerville	did you execute esd?
2005-09-03T11:08:00.000Z	Baskerville	brenner	yes, and it tells me that there is no such directory (dev/dsp)
2005-09-03T11:09:00.000Z	brenner	Baskerville	like i said ... pretty much no sound gurus in here except for crimsun... you can try this: http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/DebuggingSoundProblems/    but i'd keep droppign by in here to see if he's active
2005-09-03T11:09:00.000Z	Baskerville	brenner	Thanks!
