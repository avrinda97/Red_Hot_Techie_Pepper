2006-08-27T11:59:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nox-Hand	what do you have for sources, have you changed any?
2006-08-27T12:01:00.000Z	nox-Hand	Jack_Sparrow	all the default + automatix's and I uncommented all the debs that come default commented.
2006-08-27T12:01:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nox-Hand	You just answered your own question
2006-08-27T12:01:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nox-Hand	Automatix
2006-08-27T12:01:00.000Z	nox-Hand	Jack_Sparrow	what about it? :/
2006-08-27T12:03:00.000Z	nox-Hand	Jack_Sparrow	restore my old, and add the ones automatix added? I see that it has deleted a few repos
2006-08-27T12:03:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nox-Hand	Just say NO to automatix
2006-08-27T12:04:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nox-Hand	or go to #automatix and have them fix it
2006-09-19T11:09:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nox-Hand	Automatix is the WORST things you can run on your system
2007-08-10T09:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nox-Hand	try the bios..
2007-08-10T09:12:00.000Z	nox-Hand	Jack_Sparrow	Will have a looksie
2008-02-19T23:33:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nox-Hand	 apt-get install What?
2008-02-19T23:35:00.000Z	nox-Hand	Jack_Sparrow	Apt get install nothing, I am calling it to worko n the error from before. I was installing xubuntu-desktop from an Xorg-free Ubuntu. Then those three gave error. Apt-get install without anything automatically works on erros from before. So apt-get install acpid acpid-support and that powermanagement one
2008-02-19T23:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nox-Hand	xubuntu-desktop is what I was after...  NOt sure what an xorg-free ubuntu is so sorry I cant help with any of that
2008-02-19T23:41:00.000Z	nox-Hand	Jack_Sparrow	Ubuntu minimal install upgraded with xubuntu setup
2008-03-09T07:29:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nox-Hand	When an error is detected it sets read only
2008-03-09T07:30:00.000Z	nox-Hand	Jack_Sparrow	Roger, so I should just reboot and hope it works then? :)
2008-03-09T07:32:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nox-Hand	Dont troll for Gentoo
2008-03-09T07:32:00.000Z	nox-Hand	Jack_Sparrow	I am not trolling for GEntoo, I use Ubuntu, it was just the first example I could think of
