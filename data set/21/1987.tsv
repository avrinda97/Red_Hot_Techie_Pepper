2010-02-23T07:36:00.000Z	^sn00per^		is there a version of a boot strap that does floppy to usb  ?
2010-02-23T07:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	^sn00per^	 ive seen some (very few) disrtos that had a boot floppy image that would switch over to the USB. but I dont even rember what ones did that. Been ages since ive last seen it. It may of been PuppyLinux, or DSL, or Slackware/slax
2010-02-23T07:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	^sn00per^	 There might stillbe some disrtos out that can boot from floppy.. but ive not seen any lately  - with Grub2 it is possible to  boot from an iso file. so in theory you could put an iso file on the HD. and grub2 on a floppy..
2010-02-23T07:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	^sn00per^	 I would be suprised if grub2 coud some how boot a usb device that the pc cant see at boot up. but it may be possible
2010-02-23T07:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	^sn00per^	 if thats the case you could put an iso file on a usb drive. install grub2 to a floppy and properly configure it. and boot the iso
2010-02-23T07:44:00.000Z	^sn00per^	Dr_Willis	the thing is  the ubuntu is fully installed on that usb external drive
2010-02-23T07:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	^sn00per^	 then in Theory - you can install grub2 to the flash. and use the existing grub.cfg from the installed system to  boot the other install.
2010-02-23T07:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	^sn00per^	IF grub2 can infact boot from the usb
2010-02-23T07:45:00.000Z	^sn00per^	Dr_Willis	*shrug*  thats what i was told earlier  grub2 is the way
2010-02-23T07:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	^sn00per^	 time tolearn some grub2 then I guess.
2010-02-23T07:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	^sn00per^	 on an old old laptop  - You may want to stick to puppy
2010-02-23T07:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	^sn00per^	 whats the system specs anyway?
2010-02-23T07:50:00.000Z	^sn00per^	Dr_Willis	CPU:  Mobile Celeron 600A
2010-02-23T07:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	^sn00per^	 depending on the cpu speed that may be able to handle ubuntu good. at least you got more then 128 mb of ram
2010-02-23T07:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	^sn00per^	 hmm - you got a netbook that cant boot from usb? and its old ? Huh?
2010-02-23T07:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	^sn00per^	 any netbook should be able to boot from a properly made usb flash setup.
2010-02-23T07:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	^sn00per^	 no idea then. You could use puppy or other disrtos to chroot/debootstrap in a ubuntu install i guess..
2010-02-23T07:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	^sn00per^	 you said it worked however..  so how is it booting that
2010-02-23T07:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	^sn00per^	 are you wantign to install to the internal hard drive? or just stay with usb?
2010-02-23T07:58:00.000Z	^sn00per^	Dr_Willis	 wonder if i modify wake2pup bootloader to boot ubuntu would it be possible ?
2010-02-23T07:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	^sn00per^	 doubtfull. the disrto has to see the 'handoff' properly
