2008-09-26T22:06:00.000Z	GarethAdams_		I'm having trouble setting up my Geforce 6200LE. I can only seem to get it booting in low graphics mode
2008-09-26T22:07:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	GarethAdams_	use envy to get the drivers
2008-09-26T22:10:00.000Z	GarethAdams_	arvind_khadri	envyng is the most recent  thing I've tried
2008-09-26T22:10:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	GarethAdams_	so what happens?
2008-09-26T22:10:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	GarethAdams_	try to use the manual mode in that... it helps
2008-09-26T22:12:00.000Z	GarethAdams_	arvind_khadri	envyng -t; 1 (Install the NVIDIA driver) => correctly identifies my GeForce 6200 LE => restart => low graphics mode
2008-09-26T22:12:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	GarethAdams_	try setting the resolution now
2008-09-26T22:12:00.000Z	GarethAdams_	arvind_khadri	it tells me it's back using the vesa driver
2008-09-26T22:13:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	GarethAdams_	were you able to use the res before?
2008-09-26T22:13:00.000Z	GarethAdams_	arvind_khadri	sorry, I mean the low graphics mode dialog tells me that. I can set resolution up to 800x600
2008-09-26T22:23:00.000Z	GarethAdams_	arvind_khadri	ok, I'm using envyng manual driver install rather than the automatic one, how should I know which of the 3 numbered drivers to use?
2008-09-26T22:25:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	GarethAdams_	thats a difficult question... i use the number which is being shown to me when i boot the machine
2008-09-26T22:25:00.000Z	GarethAdams_	arvind_khadri	let me try all 3 until one works
2008-09-26T22:25:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	GarethAdams_	hmm
2008-09-26T22:36:00.000Z	GarethAdams_	arvind_khadri	all 3 drivers end me up in low graphics land :(
2008-09-26T22:44:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	GarethAdams_	do the restricted drivers help
2008-09-26T22:45:00.000Z	GarethAdams_	arvind_khadri	you'll have to remind me how to check for those
2008-09-26T22:46:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	GarethAdams_	System->Admin->Hardware drivers (assuming you are on 8.04)
2008-09-26T22:46:00.000Z	GarethAdams_	arvind_khadri	No proprietary drivers are in use on this system
2008-09-26T22:52:00.000Z	GarethAdams_	arvind_khadri	I just restarted my machine again, and hit the grub loader button. Apparently it was booting by default using the -server entry, Using the -generic entry it started up and seems to be working now :)
2008-09-26T22:53:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	GarethAdams_	cool :)
