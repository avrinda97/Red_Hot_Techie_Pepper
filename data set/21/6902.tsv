2007-01-19T09:49:00.000Z	break_		i have a question!
2007-01-19T09:49:00.000Z	break_		about partitioning
2007-01-19T09:49:00.000Z	break_		:o
2007-01-19T09:50:00.000Z	break_		NO!
2007-01-19T09:51:00.000Z	break_		i need to delete/resize an ntfs partition on my 120gb hard drive, without disturbing my other partitions on the drive
2007-01-19T09:51:00.000Z	break_		is that possible :x
2007-01-19T09:51:00.000Z	keknehv	break_	Yes, start by defragmenting your windows partition
2007-01-19T09:51:00.000Z	break_		haha, its defragged
2007-01-19T09:52:00.000Z	break_	keknehv	do you know much about windows??
2007-01-19T09:52:00.000Z	keknehv	break_	Yes
2007-01-19T09:52:00.000Z	break_		im kind of worried about something with my drive
2007-01-19T09:52:00.000Z	break_		according to o&o defrag, my MFT reserved area was huge before, but its been gradually getting smaller
2007-01-19T09:52:00.000Z	break_		now on boot windows says the drive needs to be checked for errors
2007-01-19T09:53:00.000Z	break_		last time this happened to me, chkdsk or whatever screwed the drive over and i lost everything
2007-01-19T09:53:00.000Z	keknehv	break_	What FS is your windows partition?
2007-01-19T09:53:00.000Z	break_		i need to do something with my 120gb drive so i can back stuff up a little quicker
2007-01-19T09:53:00.000Z	break_		and not waste as many dvd-'s
2007-01-19T09:54:00.000Z	break_		ntfs
