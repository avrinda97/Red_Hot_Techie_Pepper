2007-09-12T12:39:00.000Z	nickrud	tico1	there's a setting somewhere in the account settings that says leave messages on the server
2007-09-12T12:40:00.000Z	tico1	nickrud	yes but i need mi old email..... i have a lot of email from my company
2007-09-12T12:42:00.000Z	nickrud	tico1	the mail will be downloaded to outlook just fine, but left on the server for another client to download
2007-09-12T12:43:00.000Z	tico1	nickrud	another like ???:P
2007-09-12T12:44:00.000Z	nickrud	tico1	oh, evolution, or another copy of outlook. I have a boss who insists on having his mail on two machines, randomly saves it and deletes it on each machine, and I have to keep it sync'd
2007-09-12T12:46:00.000Z	nickrud	tico1	I have one client never delete mail from the server (set up in the account settings) and the other deletes it after 10 days.
