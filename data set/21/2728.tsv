2010-11-15T11:40:00.000Z	gogeta1	bastidrazor	its ex4
2010-11-15T11:40:00.000Z	bastidrazor	gogeta1	right, i haven't seen anything about ext4 and writeback working.. google fails for the moment
2010-11-15T11:40:00.000Z	gogeta1	bastidrazor	all other options work other then wrieback
2010-11-15T11:41:00.000Z	gogeta1	bastidrazor	think i forgot the rootflag
2010-11-15T12:07:00.000Z	gogeta1	bastidrazor	and wala it works now
2010-11-15T12:07:00.000Z	gogeta1	bastidrazor	i forgot the tun2fs command
2010-11-15T12:07:00.000Z	bastidrazor	gogeta1	do you notice a difference?
2010-11-15T12:07:00.000Z	gogeta1	bastidrazor	huge
2010-11-15T12:08:00.000Z	gogeta1	bastidrazor	turned off real time and orderd
2010-11-15T12:08:00.000Z	bastidrazor	gogeta1	what are the drawbacks though?
2010-11-15T12:08:00.000Z	gogeta1	bastidrazor	also check to make ture its running and it is
2010-11-15T12:09:00.000Z	gogeta1	bastidrazor	not mutch relly it wil tos the last bits of data if you crash
2010-11-15T12:09:00.000Z	gogeta1	bastidrazor	so might lose a paragraph of your work you where in the middle off but not all of it
2010-11-15T12:11:00.000Z	bastidrazor	gogeta1	applications load faster and whatnot?
2010-11-15T12:12:00.000Z	gogeta1	bastidrazor	well in the case of a slow ssd like i have yes being less wirghting going on and helps extennd its life a bit
2010-11-15T12:12:00.000Z	gogeta1	bastidrazor	its best to go no jurnel but im not that cavler lol
2010-11-15T12:13:00.000Z	gogeta1	bastidrazor	so i switched the the jurnel with the least amount of writes
2010-11-15T12:15:00.000Z	gogeta1	bastidrazor	but if you have a newer gen ssd they got good wareleveling and its not going to relly hurt it
2010-11-15T12:30:00.000Z	bastidrazor	gogeta1	do you have a seperate /home or is everything on the / partition?
