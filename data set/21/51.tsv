2012-11-05T01:21:00.000Z	phirex		I dont mind messing with terminal a little bit, but i prefer not to, does anyone know a upnp media server that is easy to use? or anyone can guide me with MediaTomb? I added my folder "Downloads" and it doesnt show the sub-directories of it....
2012-11-05T01:22:00.000Z	gordonjcp	phirex	mediatomb is fiddly as hell to get going
2012-11-05T01:22:00.000Z	gordonjcp	phirex	I use minidlna, but you will need to use the terminal a little to get it set up
2012-11-05T01:22:00.000Z	gordonjcp	phirex	once it's going it's pretty much rock solid
2012-11-05T01:23:00.000Z	phirex	gordonjcp	does it refresh the directories automatically?
2012-11-05T01:23:00.000Z	gordonjcp	phirex	yes, mostly
2012-11-05T01:23:00.000Z	gordonjcp	phirex	I've managed to catch it out
2012-11-05T01:23:00.000Z	phirex	gordonjcp	catch it out?
2012-11-05T01:24:00.000Z	gordonjcp	phirex	very occasionally when I drop a bunch of stuff into a directory under circumstances I can never quite replicate, it doesn't update properly
2012-11-05T01:24:00.000Z	gordonjcp	phirex	usually restarting it cures the problem, and if that doesn't I just delete its database and let it re-index the content
2012-11-05T01:25:00.000Z	phirex	gordonjcp	i'm really surprised theres no easy to use program with a gui :/
2012-11-05T01:25:00.000Z	gordonjcp	phirex	it seems that if I add files to it when my PS3 is actively streaming stuff, it doesn't update properly
2012-11-05T01:25:00.000Z	gordonjcp	phirex	it's a server
2012-11-05T01:25:00.000Z	gordonjcp	phirex	why would a server have a GUI?
2012-11-05T01:25:00.000Z	phirex	gordonjcp	to set it up...
2012-11-05T01:25:00.000Z	gordonjcp	phirex	I don't understand
2012-11-05T01:26:00.000Z	phirex	gordonjcp	im talking about setting up which folders the server would share
2012-11-05T01:26:00.000Z	gordonjcp	phirex	oh, you just list those in the config file
2012-11-05T01:26:00.000Z	phirex	gordonjcp	so what else should be tweaked before its ready to go?
2012-11-05T01:27:00.000Z	phirex	gordonjcp	ok anyway i'll try it now! thanks :)
2012-11-05T01:27:00.000Z	gordonjcp	phirex	I literally just changed the line that says media_dir=/whatever to point to where I put video
