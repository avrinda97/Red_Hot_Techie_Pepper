2006-11-26T17:12:00.000Z	steve		but i got a little question
2006-11-26T17:13:00.000Z	steve		i just installed ubuntu 6.10 everything seems fine i got a new system with sata drives so i installed it to my sata disk
2006-11-26T17:13:00.000Z	steve		i said in the setup grub should be installed to hd0
2006-11-26T17:13:00.000Z	steve		but when i reboot grub doesn't show up what could be the problem?
2006-11-26T17:13:00.000Z	steve		anyone has a idea?
2006-11-26T17:14:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	steve	do you boot into ubunut?
2006-11-26T17:14:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	steve	are you able to boot?
2006-11-26T17:15:00.000Z	steve		booting into ubuntu is NOT possible
2006-11-26T17:15:00.000Z	steve		but i cna boot windows xp which is on the same disk
2006-11-26T17:15:00.000Z	steve		perfectly
2006-11-26T17:16:00.000Z	steve		no never bootet
2006-11-26T17:17:00.000Z	steve		it just gets installed
2006-11-26T17:17:00.000Z	steve		setup says you can reboot the system now
2006-11-26T17:17:00.000Z	steve		i do so
2006-11-26T17:17:00.000Z	steve		but ubuntu doesn't boot up
2006-11-26T17:17:00.000Z	steve		just windows xp loads
2006-11-26T17:17:00.000Z	steve		grub doesn't show up
2006-11-26T17:17:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	steve	sounds like grub never installed too the mbr...
2006-11-26T17:18:00.000Z	steve	devilsadvocate	got the same idea, the setup says grub will be installed to hd0 but what is hd0 i mean i got a raid controller in my system with ide disks did grub get installed to one of those now or how to tell the setup to put grub on my sata disk?
