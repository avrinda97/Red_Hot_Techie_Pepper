2007-10-15T13:08:00.000Z	toed		is there a way to return all the desktop/menu/panel settings to the default?
2007-10-15T13:08:00.000Z	toed		nothing works in my normal user but if I make a new one it all works fine
2007-10-15T13:10:00.000Z	Curley_Sue	toed	what does not work..?
2007-10-15T13:11:00.000Z	toed	Curley_Sue	any program I try to start, it just says "starting __" and then disappears and nothing happens
2007-10-15T13:11:00.000Z	Curley_Sue		! tell me about driver
2007-10-15T13:21:00.000Z	Curley_Sue	toed	what desktop-manager are you using? the default gnome?
2007-10-15T13:21:00.000Z	toed	Curley_Sue	yeah
2007-10-15T13:21:00.000Z	toed		really haven't changed anything except for addign a few applets to the panel
2007-10-15T13:27:00.000Z	Curley_Sue	toed	you said that opening a new user allows you normal work?
2007-10-15T13:27:00.000Z	toed	Curley_Sue	yeah everything works fine for the normal user, but not my regular one
2007-10-15T13:30:00.000Z	toed	Curley_Sue	hrm, I wiped ~/.gnome2 and ~/.gconf but it didn't fix the problem
2007-10-15T13:33:00.000Z	Curley_Sue	toed	I would compare files of the same sort (.something) between the two users...
2007-10-15T13:34:00.000Z	Curley_Sue	toed	I have a very ugly solution (that is, if you can't figure a nicer one) - open a new user which has the same sudo permissions as your original and copy all important files form your home to the new one...
2007-10-15T13:35:00.000Z	Curley_Sue		need help: I need to use a framegrabber which driver I have for kernel 2.2 only. how can i install the driver in gutsy?
2007-10-15T13:36:00.000Z	Curley_Sue	toed	try cancelling the desktop special effects...
2007-10-15T13:37:00.000Z	toed	Curley_Sue	they're off, I just copied the .gconf and .gnome2 from the new user to the old one but that hasn't fixed things either
2007-10-15T13:45:00.000Z	toed	Curley_Sue	I really don't get it, I wiped the *entire* home of the old user, still nada
2007-10-15T13:46:00.000Z	Curley_Sue	toed	which user are you using for that (removing the files)?
2007-10-15T13:46:00.000Z	toed		root
2007-10-15T13:46:00.000Z	toed		well, the old one sudoed to root
2007-10-15T13:49:00.000Z	Curley_Sue	toed	make sure u have removed the files from the users home and not from root's... I think your user should be logged off to effetively remove the files since gnome is probably recreating the files based on current settings (which are bad...)
