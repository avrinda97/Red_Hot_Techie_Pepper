2010-09-23T05:48:00.000Z	rames		wow ... i hate to say i'm very disappointed by ubuntu netbook remix attention to details ... there's a lot of random little hurdles you have to jump over
2010-09-23T05:49:00.000Z	Gnea	rames	such as?
2010-09-23T05:49:00.000Z	rames		gnea: 1) closing bugs "when using external monitors just log out and log back in using a different session"
2010-09-23T05:50:00.000Z	rames		gnea: 2) unable to configure panel when in "netbook session" (for whatever bass ackward reason), you have to clone / destroy default GNOME session in order to configure panels (ie: add applet, change applets, etc)
2010-09-23T05:51:00.000Z	Gnea	rames	1) netbooks typically use intel-based video hardware, restarting X is typically the only way. Deal with it or write a patch.
2010-09-23T05:53:00.000Z	rames		gnea: i can understand technical difficulties (ie: video driver doesn't support xyz) but for example i just needed to  (from regular gnome session) gconf-edit top_panel_screen0 to be on monitor=1 ... i mean ... "it would be nice" if things were a bit more automatic
2010-09-23T05:54:00.000Z	rames		gnea: just disappointed that it requires some manual intervention (hopefully scriptable) to "do the right thing" and it's good to know there are driver issues preventing some of the things i'd like to have
2010-09-23T05:55:00.000Z	Gnea	rames	it's open source software. if it's not there, then you make it happen. you can't complain to a bunch of non-paid people to demand the kinds of things that you can from a bunch of paid employees whose job it is to make those changes... just sayin'
2010-09-23T05:55:00.000Z	Gnea	rames	the "right thing" is to implement it yourself, or find someone else who's trying to work on it.
2010-09-23T05:56:00.000Z	rames	Gnea	yeah... but the other frustrating thing is that maverick netbook seems to completely change stuff (and is currently too buggy for me to use) ... i just got this netbook and am trying to match a ubuntu config to what the original xandros behaviour was (asus 1000)
2010-09-23T05:56:00.000Z	Gnea	rames	not trying to sound like a jerk here, but historically, that's how it works. now, the evolution of gnome itself came about as a direct result of people being paid by redhat to develop it.
2010-09-23T05:57:00.000Z	Gnea	rames	have you attempted to post something about it to ubuntuforums.org? perhaps someone else has done that work already
2010-09-23T05:57:00.000Z	rames	Gnea	yeah... you're much more polite about not being a jerk than a lot of other people usually are :) ... just frustrated as i'm coming from mac hardware / software to kindof esoteric linux system
2010-09-23T05:58:00.000Z	rames	Gnea	been all over the forums w.r.t. the "can't add applet to panel" thing
2010-09-23T05:58:00.000Z	rames	Gnea	and w.r.t. "when i plug in the monitor the panels don't do the right thing" it's not that big a deal now that i understand what's going on...
2010-09-23T05:58:00.000Z	Gnea	rames	I honestly can't see a reason to do so, it's small enough as it is
2010-09-23T05:59:00.000Z	rames	Gnea	hah.  yeah you and mr. shuttleworth both!  :^) problem is that if you want to change task-switcher-a to task-switcher-b you can't it's somehow locked down so tight it requires a restart to make any changes (even in gconf-edit)
2010-09-23T06:00:00.000Z	rames	Gnea	*AND* (key point) for example if there's an eee-pc applet that makes buttons to do something funny you can't add it ... i think it might only be able to go into notify area which not all applets are designed to do
2010-09-23T06:01:00.000Z	Gnea	rames	haven't seen/heard of that one before... would be nice
2010-09-23T06:01:00.000Z	rames	Gnea	but i do understand the rationale- don't want gramma messing up gnome-panel on a netbook ... that's just bad news, although i don't understand why you can't "sudo unlock-panel && sudo relock-panel"
2010-09-23T06:02:00.000Z	rames	Gnea	so it's little stuff like that ... you have the "i know what's best for you" attitude but you can't add a button to the panel that toggles stuff around due to external monitor plug events, etc.
