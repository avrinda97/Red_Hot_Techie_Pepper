2006-01-15T08:52:00.000Z	soundray		I'm looking for an HTML photo gallery generator. Synaptic throws up a few package names -- any experiences? Recommendations?
2006-01-15T08:53:00.000Z	Madpilot	soundray	gThumb has a decent basic gallery maker
2006-01-15T08:54:00.000Z	soundray	Madpilot	is it reasonably easy to customize the HTML templates?
2006-01-15T08:54:00.000Z	Madpilot	soundray	I don't know, actually, I've used it once just to test
2006-01-15T08:55:00.000Z	soundray	Madpilot	thanks, I'll have a look.
2006-03-10T16:30:00.000Z	soundray	Madpilot	the bad thing about repeating is that it works most of the time :(
2006-03-11T17:23:00.000Z	Madpilot	soundray	isn't English fun? :P
2006-03-11T17:24:00.000Z	soundray	Madpilot	yes, a source of enjoyment, amusement and pleasure ;)
2006-03-11T07:07:00.000Z	soundray	Madpilot	trademarked. Can't have copyright on a word.
2006-03-11T07:07:00.000Z	Madpilot	soundray	right - close enough
2006-05-25T14:05:00.000Z	soundray	Madpilot	he did
2006-05-25T14:15:00.000Z	soundray	Madpilot	what a grateful client ;)
2006-06-09T07:01:00.000Z	soundray	Madpilot	is that a potato variety? :)
2006-06-09T07:01:00.000Z	Madpilot	soundray	possibly. GPL genetic engineering, of course ;)
2006-07-15T06:15:00.000Z	soundray	Madpilot	oh, I've been pawned ;)
2007-04-26T14:27:00.000Z	soundray	Madpilot	feisty comes with compiz, not beryl
2007-04-26T14:28:00.000Z	Madpilot	soundray	I haven't bothered to follow the whole compiz/beryl/what's in Feisty debate - what is the System->Prefs->Desktop Effects thing?
2007-04-26T14:29:00.000Z	soundray	Madpilot	it swaps metacity for compiz, afaik. Never worked for me
2007-04-26T14:30:00.000Z	Madpilot	soundray	ah, ok. not actually that interested - I can live without wobbly windows and such - but I was curious what the menu option did. Nothing much, evidently.
2007-10-20T02:06:00.000Z	soundray	Madpilot	no! How annoying...
2007-10-20T02:07:00.000Z	Madpilot	soundray	it's minor, but irritating. My splash screen has also been replaced by a Gnome default blue one, but that I know how to fix...
