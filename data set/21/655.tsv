2011-09-02T22:25:00.000Z	grillermo		can anybody read me?
2011-09-02T22:26:00.000Z	Polah	grillermo	Nope
2011-09-02T22:28:00.000Z	Polah	grillermo	Nautilus is not for displaying files, it shows directories. You can't open files in nautilus, you have to open them in their appropriate program.
2011-09-02T22:28:00.000Z	grillermo	Polah	could you run that command to see if you get the same message please, i just need to know that
2011-09-02T22:30:00.000Z	Polah	grillermo	I get the error too because like I said, it is for displaying directory structure, not the contents of files.
2011-09-02T22:30:00.000Z	grillermo	Polah	but if you try gnome-open "the file" it works right? for me it doesnt
2011-09-02T22:33:00.000Z	Polah	grillermo	gnome-open opens files based on designated file handlers in gnome, I guess you don't have any set perhaps
2011-09-02T22:33:00.000Z	grillermo	Polah	if i open nautilus i can open all the files just fine, and the files on desktop have no problem
2011-09-02T22:34:00.000Z	Polah	grillermo	But gnome-open doesn't work?
2011-09-02T22:34:00.000Z	grillermo	Polah	yeah gnome-open doesnt work
2011-09-02T22:34:00.000Z	grillermo	Polah	my /user/share/applications .desktop files are ok
2011-09-02T22:34:00.000Z	Polah	grillermo	I couldn't tell you how to fix it, I've never used it myself.
