2006-06-10T09:48:00.000Z	VolVE		Hey all, installing 6.06 Server, the installer seems to be stuck on the "Configuring man-db..." step, been there for over a minute... any ideas? :-/
2006-06-10T09:48:00.000Z	Seveas	VolVE	just wait. some configure commands take a while
2006-06-10T09:49:00.000Z	VolVE	Seveas	I'm being patient, just seems an odd one... :)
2006-06-10T10:06:00.000Z	Seveas	VolVE	that sounds bad, kill it and try dpkg --configure -a
2006-06-10T10:06:00.000Z	VolVE	Seveas	yeah, it's still at that same "Configuring man-db..." step... :-/
2006-06-10T10:11:00.000Z	VolVE	Seveas	how can I kill it when it's part of the install process?
2006-06-10T10:11:00.000Z	Seveas	VolVE	ah, it's not an upgrade but you are installing Ubuntu right now?
2006-06-10T10:11:00.000Z	VolVE	Seveas	correct :)
2006-06-10T10:12:00.000Z	VolVE	Seveas	6.06 Server i386 install CD
2006-06-10T10:12:00.000Z	Seveas	VolVE	in that case I'd recommend rebooting, checking the cd and then restarting the install
2006-06-10T10:12:00.000Z	Seveas	VolVE	with <alt><f4> (right now) you should be able to see more info
2006-06-10T10:15:00.000Z	VolVE	Seveas	I'm rebooting and testing the CD right now, but Alf-F4 only said "11:37 Setting up ubuntu-standard..." no errors or anything, very odd
2006-06-10T10:19:00.000Z	VolVE	Seveas	CD test was fine, I'm going to try installing again...
2006-06-10T10:43:00.000Z	VolVE	Seveas	now it's stuck at "Configuring ltrace..." :(
2006-06-10T10:44:00.000Z	Seveas	VolVE	is that earlier or later in the process?
2006-06-10T10:44:00.000Z	VolVE	Seveas	I'm not sure, they were both ni the 70% range
2006-06-10T10:44:00.000Z	Seveas	VolVE	how much memory do you have? and how much diskspace on '/' ?
2006-06-10T10:45:00.000Z	VolVE	Seveas	1GB of RAM, and I allocated the / partition 500MB, also: /home, /var, /usr, /tmp, /root all had their own partitions
2006-06-10T10:45:00.000Z	Seveas	VolVE	how much on /var?
2006-06-10T10:47:00.000Z	VolVE	Seveas	thanks, I'll take a look
2006-06-10T10:52:00.000Z	VolVE	Seveas	no errors in syslog, maybe it's a bad disk or something... :_(
