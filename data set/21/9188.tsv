2009-05-17T09:28:00.000Z	pengy		Hey guys, im trying to dualboot vista and ubuntu, but i cant get past the ability to shrink my drive with the vista shrink device. Heres a screen shot : http://img193.imageshack.us/img193/641/shrinkfuu.png
2009-05-17T09:29:00.000Z	pengy		yeah like i have 30gb+ of free space
2009-05-17T09:29:00.000Z	pengy		but the srink will only let me do 742MB
2009-05-17T09:30:00.000Z	pengy		At first it wouldnt even give me an amont to shrink, but then i used perfect disk, and now im able to do the 742MB but its still not enough.

2009-05-17T09:32:00.000Z	AlbertoP	pengy	np...I've just too many windows open :)
2009-05-17T09:33:00.000Z	AlbertoP	pengy	Windows creates the virtual memory file, which might be at the end of your partition, or somewhere close to the end. You can remove it disabling the swap in Windows.
2009-05-17T09:34:00.000Z	AlbertoP	pengy	I'm not on windows right now

2009-05-17T09:46:00.000Z	AlbertoP	pengy	is that a laptop?
2009-05-17T09:46:00.000Z	AlbertoP	pengy	brand?
2009-05-17T09:47:00.000Z	AlbertoP	pengy	ok... the first 78MB are for system tools. The last one is probably the media-center (if you have a media-center key)
2009-05-17T09:48:00.000Z	AlbertoP	pengy	hint: pay _a_lot_ of attention not to damage the media center partition, if it is the case, because to rebuild it on dell systems, you have to format also the main win installation :\
2009-05-17T09:48:00.000Z	AlbertoP	pengy	that one
2009-05-17T09:49:00.000Z	AlbertoP	pengy	for sure...it's exactly its size
2009-05-17T09:50:00.000Z	AlbertoP	pengy	did you remove the virtual memory?
2009-05-17T09:51:00.000Z	AlbertoP	pengy	ok. The only hope you have now is to defragment your disk
2009-05-17T09:51:00.000Z	AlbertoP	pengy	still nothing?
2009-05-17T09:52:00.000Z	AlbertoP	pengy	simply use the vista defrag...
2009-05-17T09:55:00.000Z	AlbertoP	pengy	no don't do that on your config. GParted won't recognize the dell partition for media direct and kill it unfortunately
2009-05-17T09:55:00.000Z	AlbertoP	pengy	let's talk in pvt
