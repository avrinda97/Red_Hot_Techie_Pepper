2010-02-04T00:43:00.000Z	jellow	jiohdi	sounds like a bug , Any output from terminal?
2010-02-04T01:14:00.000Z	jiohdi	jellow	I get BadAlloc (insufficient resources for operation)'.
2010-02-04T01:14:00.000Z	jiohdi	jellow	for totem vanishing trying to play youtube
2010-02-04T01:15:00.000Z	jellow	jiohdi	go in mplayer preferences>video>available drivers. select X11 (OpenGL). Save your settings and restart your application.
2010-02-04T01:17:00.000Z	jiohdi	jellow	no such options exist video is not among what is found
2010-02-04T01:20:00.000Z	jellow	jiohdi	what am i talking about , Your using totem , The problem is that you graphics card can't handle the display resolution
2010-02-04T01:22:00.000Z	jellow	jiohdi	You need to tell totem to use opengl
2010-02-04T01:22:00.000Z	jiohdi	jellow	understood, but there is no option in mplayer for that
2010-02-04T01:27:00.000Z	jellow	jiohdi	I have no idea , you could try adding to .config/totem/state.ini
2010-02-04T01:27:00.000Z	jellow	jiohdi	add   video.driver:opengl
2010-02-04T01:28:00.000Z	jiohdi	jellow	are you sure, I dont want to mess up the system
2010-02-04T01:28:00.000Z	jellow	jiohdi	It won't mess your system up
2010-02-04T01:29:00.000Z	jellow	jiohdi	or try a smaller display
2010-02-04T01:34:00.000Z	jiohdi	jellow	under totem all I found was %gconf.xml and plugins
2010-02-04T01:38:00.000Z	jiohdi	jellow	can't I tell my system over all to use the opengl
2010-02-04T01:40:00.000Z	jellow	jiohdi	Try that , I had a look founf the congig in gconf-editor under apps , no idea what to put in though sorry
2010-02-04T01:40:00.000Z	jiohdi	jellow	any idea how I get the whole system to use opengl for x?
2010-02-04T01:43:00.000Z	jellow	jiohdi	Would involve Xorg.conf can't help you, Can't you use another app ?
2010-02-04T01:44:00.000Z	jiohdi	jellow	is there another app that runs youtube without a browser?
2010-02-04T01:49:00.000Z	jellow	jiohdi	Have a look at boxee , not perfect perhaps some one else knows another media player that can play youtube videos ?
2010-02-04T01:53:00.000Z	jellow	jiohdi	Here how to install anyway http://techdrivein.blogspot.com/2009/12/install-boxee-in-ubuntu-910-karmic.html
