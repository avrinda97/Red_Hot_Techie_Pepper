2006-03-15T09:08:00.000Z	eth0		hi, could anyone tell me, is it best to learn bash or c programming first?
2006-03-15T09:08:00.000Z	bfield	eth0	did you look for howto's?
2006-03-15T09:08:00.000Z	bfield		hmm
2006-03-15T09:08:00.000Z	bfield		I agree with Luis there.
2006-03-15T09:08:00.000Z	eth0	bfield	couldn't find anything on google
2006-03-15T09:08:00.000Z	bfield		hmm

2006-03-15T09:09:00.000Z	bfield	eth0	here's a good link for C programming
2006-03-15T09:09:00.000Z	bfield		http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/Dave/C/
2006-03-15T09:10:00.000Z	bfield		luis, well I guess I'll just wait the month or two till they release it.
2006-03-15T09:10:00.000Z	bfield		ususally is best that way
2006-03-15T09:10:00.000Z	eth0	bfield	im not looking for a text on c, i aleady have a couple of books
2006-03-15T09:10:00.000Z	bfield		luis, yea thats what I heard
2006-03-15T09:10:00.000Z	eth0	bfield	im wondering whether to startr with c or bash
2006-03-15T09:11:00.000Z	bfield	eth0	I'd say bash then, its bit easier
2006-03-15T09:11:00.000Z	bfield	eth0	have you looked into realbasic?
2006-03-15T09:11:00.000Z	eth0		what's realbasic
2006-03-15T09:12:00.000Z	bfield	eth0	its the basic programming language, but with an easy use IDE, very similar to Visual Basic
2006-03-15T09:12:00.000Z	eth0	bfield	well i've already started with c
2006-03-15T09:12:00.000Z	bfield	eth0	well then stick with it, it's all prefrence I guess
