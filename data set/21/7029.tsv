2007-01-03T15:07:00.000Z	feryana		how can I save all my e-mail folders from Evolution? I would like to  make a whole backup of it, because I have several filters and important e-mails that I don't want to lose!!!
2007-01-03T15:09:00.000Z	feryana		!evolution
2007-01-03T15:11:00.000Z	feryana		how can I make a backup of an entire program with all the configurations and options (such filters on Evolution) Thanks
2007-01-03T15:12:00.000Z	n2diy	feryana	are you in X?
2007-01-03T15:12:00.000Z	feryana	n2diy	I have dapper drake 6.10
2007-01-03T15:13:00.000Z	n2diy	feryana	click on places-home folder.
2007-01-03T15:14:00.000Z	n2diy	feryana	use my nick when you reply, so it is highlighted for me. Ok, can you see your /.evolution directory?
2007-01-03T15:15:00.000Z	feryana	n2diy	yep I copied the entire folder .evolution
2007-01-03T15:15:00.000Z	n2diy	feryana	ok, that isn't what I wanted you to do, try right clicking on the folder, and select archive.
2007-01-03T15:17:00.000Z	n2diy	feryana	whoops, create archive.
2007-01-03T15:17:00.000Z	feryana	n2diy	create archive? I don't have an "archive" option
2007-01-03T15:17:00.000Z	n2diy	feryana	yes.
2007-01-03T15:17:00.000Z	n2diy	feryana	yes.
2007-01-03T15:18:00.000Z	feryana	n2diy	OK is working :)
2007-01-03T15:19:00.000Z	n2diy	feryana	ok, now that file is a compressed tar ball of all your evolution stuff, you could move it to a USB stick for safe keeping.
2007-01-03T15:20:00.000Z	n2diy	feryana	ok, If you want to save all/most of your stuff, go up a directory, and archive feryana.
2007-01-03T15:21:00.000Z	n2diy	feryana	that will include .evolution too.
2007-01-03T15:21:00.000Z	feryana	n2diy	OK. Then when I install Ubuntu on the new pc, when I move that folder I will have all already installed?
2007-01-03T15:22:00.000Z	n2diy	feryana	nope, move the file back to where it belongs, then right click on it, and extract it.
2007-01-03T15:23:00.000Z	feryana	n2diy	I know that, I mean, when I extract all to it place, all the software will be installed again? Or I must start from 0 doing the synaptics stufff and all of that
2007-01-03T15:24:00.000Z	n2diy	feryana	you'll probably have to use synaptic again, unless you can also back up /var, /usr/local, and /etc, even then, you won't be guarnteed a full back up.
