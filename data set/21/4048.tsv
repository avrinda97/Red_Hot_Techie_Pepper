2008-09-25T03:09:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	DavidCanarias	I'm suspicious of that message tbh. Ubuntu includes FF3.0 with security patches.
2008-09-25T03:10:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	DavidCanarias	in fact I'm sure. The ubuntu Hardy FF, assuming you have applied automatic updates from apt, is the latest
2008-09-25T03:10:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	DavidCanarias	if you go to Help -> About in FF it tells you the version at the bottom
2008-09-25T03:11:00.000Z	DavidCanarias	SlimeyPete	That is exactly what I thought and its why I don't understand whats happening
2008-09-25T03:11:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	DavidCanarias	I think hotmail is reading the useragent incorrectly or something
2008-09-25T03:12:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	DavidCanarias	or else perhaps it hasn't been taught that 3.0.2 is the latest version
2008-09-25T03:12:00.000Z	DavidCanarias	SlimeyPete	I just don't know. I'd like to find a solution with a bit of help
2008-09-25T03:13:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	DavidCanarias	well as it's definitely up-to-date in ubuntu I would suggest that you have to ask MS/an MS forum for help; Ubuntu/FF is not at fault as far as I can see
2008-09-25T03:14:00.000Z	DavidCanarias	SlimeyPete	dr_willis: Can I try updating on terminal??
2008-09-25T03:14:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	DavidCanarias	nothing's wrong with your FF. I'm sure mine is working fine and I still see the message.
2008-09-25T03:15:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	DavidCanarias	updating won't make any difference. you already have the latest version.
2008-09-25T03:15:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	DavidCanarias	though for the record, "sudo apt-get update firefox" will do the update if a newer version is available
2008-09-25T03:16:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	DavidCanarias	basically the hotmail devs haven't reacted fast enough to the latest FF update
2008-09-25T03:17:00.000Z	DavidCanarias	SlimeyPete	Thats fine, but I cant access my hotmail account
2008-09-25T03:17:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	DavidCanarias	hrm. Odd. I can access mine albeit with the old interface. However, mine is a very old account.
2008-09-25T03:17:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	DavidCanarias	did you click "continue to Windows Live hotmail"?
2008-09-25T03:19:00.000Z	DavidCanarias	SlimeyPete	No i clicked on the Linux option not windows
2008-09-25T03:20:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	DavidCanarias	hrm, hang on
2008-09-25T03:20:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	DavidCanarias	it says "download new browsers blah blah..." and then at the bottom there's a link to "continue to Windows Live hotmail"
2008-09-25T03:21:00.000Z	DavidCanarias	SlimeyPete	Eureka you have hit the nail on the head. A million thanks to you!!!!
2008-09-25T03:21:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	DavidCanarias	np :)
