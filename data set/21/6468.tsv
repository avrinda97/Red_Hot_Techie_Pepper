2007-04-05T10:22:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	mark__	check your /var/log/xorg.log files for error messages. Also, check /etc/X11/xorg.conf and make sure that the "device" section is using "nvidia" as the driver name.
2007-04-05T10:22:00.000Z	mark__	SlimeyPete	i checked device section and it it using nvidia, the xorg.log on the otherhand looks all screwy
2007-04-05T10:23:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	mark__	what's it say?
2007-04-05T10:24:00.000Z	mark__	SlimeyPete	failed to load modual, does not exist
2007-04-05T10:25:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	mark__	how did you install the drivers? Did you use synaptic?
2007-04-05T10:25:00.000Z	mark__	SlimeyPete	then it says no drivers available
2007-04-05T10:25:00.000Z	mark__	SlimeyPete	no i used automatix
2007-04-05T10:25:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	mark__	erk. Don't.
2007-04-05T10:25:00.000Z	mark__	SlimeyPete	what can i do?
2007-04-05T10:26:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	mark__	you can use the nvidia-glx or nvidia-glx-legacy drivers from Synaptic, or "roll your own" using the official NVida installer (from their website)
2007-04-05T10:26:00.000Z	mark__	SlimeyPete	how can i get them thro the term? since i cant startx
2007-04-05T10:28:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	mark__	you can apt-get from the terminal. For instance, do a "apt-cache search nvidia" to find nvidia packages and then "sudo apt-get install <package name>"
2007-04-05T10:28:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	mark__	if you need to access the nvidia website, do a "sudo apt-get install links-ssl", then run links - it's a text-mode web browser
2007-04-05T10:29:00.000Z	mark__	SlimeyPete	do you now what i can search for to get the mouse cursor to work in the terminal?
2007-04-05T10:29:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	mark__	not sure, sorry. I have not needed to do that before.
