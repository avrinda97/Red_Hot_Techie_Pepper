2007-09-10T06:24:00.000Z	Nyle		I want to connect to a vnc server at home from elsewhere.  Which ports do I need to forward on my router so that vnc sessions can be accessed
2007-09-10T06:24:00.000Z	Pici	Nyle	5900 & 5901
2007-09-10T06:24:00.000Z	Nyle	Pici	thank you very much
2007-09-10T06:24:00.000Z	Nyle	Pici	may I ask how you found this information?
2007-09-10T06:25:00.000Z	Pici	Nyle	I've been using VNC for years, I just know it ;)
2007-09-10T06:25:00.000Z	Pici	Nyle	add more numbers to 5901 if you run more than 1 server.
2007-09-10T06:25:00.000Z	Pici	Nyle	i.e. 5902,5903 etc.
2007-09-10T06:26:00.000Z	Nyle	Pici	I would like to pick your brain a bit.  I have a cable modem > wireless router AP > 3 rooms down WIRELESS router in Client mode.  router1 forwards ports to rotuer 2, which in turn runs the little subnet in my room.  I want to connect to my desktop using vnc, but go through all those.  I can configure my NAT no problem, but how can I add a bit more security to this?
2007-09-10T06:28:00.000Z	Nyle	Pici	any advice?
2007-09-10T06:30:00.000Z	Nyle	Pici	if I run vncserver on :1 while :0 is my real desktop, will I be able to use my original desktop somehow?
2007-09-10T06:30:00.000Z	Nyle	Pici	does vnc allow to connect to already running desktop or must I start a new session in :1
2007-09-10T06:30:00.000Z	Pici	Nyle	I do not know.  Unfortunately, most of my VNC knowledge is based on Windows installs.
2007-09-11T07:58:00.000Z	Pici	Nyle	read above.
2007-09-28T09:56:00.000Z	Pici	Nyle	As far as I know thats not possible in gnome.
2007-09-28T09:57:00.000Z	Nyle	Pici	well I had originally said that I like kde becase it has what gnome doesn't.  someone asked me what, and so i told them
2007-09-28T09:57:00.000Z	Pici	Nyle	I thought you were asking a question, sorry.
2007-09-28T09:57:00.000Z	Nyle	Pici	oh no :)
2007-09-29T07:44:00.000Z	Pici	Nyle	Yes.
2007-09-29T07:45:00.000Z	Nyle	Pici	from which debian release?
2007-09-29T07:45:00.000Z	Pici	Nyle	to some extent at least, Packages made specifically for debian may not work properly, but .debs made for ubuntu work fine.
2007-10-05T07:35:00.000Z	Pici	Nyle	18th.
