2010-11-20T07:16:00.000Z	Skapare	aarcane	shouldn't that be the other way around?
2010-11-20T07:17:00.000Z	aarcane	Skapare	maybe.  but if it's missing, it should be autodetected or recreated :)
2010-11-20T07:18:00.000Z	Skapare	aarcane	but it would be faster to move his .bak into place?
2010-11-20T07:18:00.000Z	aarcane	Skapare	if he set it using the GUI, it wouldn't have let him set it too high, so that probably won't help.
2010-11-20T07:19:00.000Z	Skapare	aarcane	oh, I have set it bad myself before ... doesn't always catch it for some cards
2010-11-20T07:19:00.000Z	Skapare	aarcane	err, for  some monitors
2010-11-20T07:20:00.000Z	Skapare	aarcane	if the mv doesn't work, then yeah, rm ot mv to a crazy name would be next step
2010-11-20T07:21:00.000Z	Skapare	aarcane	you know how to change the background image at login time (gdm)?
2010-11-20T07:23:00.000Z	aarcane	Skapare	I used to, before they took all the configuration items out of gdm-config.  try finding gdm.conf and poking at it.
2010-11-20T07:24:00.000Z	Skapare	aarcane	well I might try that ... or just look for a file being changed ... I have drive snapshots from before so I can see what changed
2010-11-20T07:24:00.000Z	Skapare	aarcane	was hoping they would try to make it GUI user friendly
2010-11-20T07:53:00.000Z	Skapare	aarcane	where do I get to this config tool you mentioned?
2010-11-20T07:57:00.000Z	aarcane	Skapare	used to be an app called gdm-config or gdm-admin or some such.  it still exists, but now it has like 1 page with 2 options total.  once upon a time it let you do everything under the sun.
2010-11-20T07:58:00.000Z	Skapare	aarcane	so is that why Ubuntu is getting away from Gnome?
2010-11-20T07:58:00.000Z	aarcane	Skapare	I think it's the other way around, but I don't know.
2010-11-20T07:59:00.000Z	Skapare	aarcane	is it "more user friendly" to reduce choice, or to increase choice (that maybe one of the choices will be what the user wants to do)?
2010-11-20T08:00:00.000Z	aarcane	Skapare	it's more end-user friendly, and less power-user friendly.
2010-11-20T08:02:00.000Z	Skapare	aarcane	and I'm not a "power user" in the GUI sense ... I'm a hardware/systems guy ... I hack BIOSes, boot loaders, kernels, and init scripts ... I'm clueless about GUI environments
2010-11-20T08:02:00.000Z	Skapare	aarcane	if it's "abstract" it makes no sense to me
2010-11-20T08:02:00.000Z	aarcane	Skapare	sounds like someone else I know.  anyway, I'm poofing.
2010-11-20T08:03:00.000Z	Skapare	aarcane	bye ... and thanks
