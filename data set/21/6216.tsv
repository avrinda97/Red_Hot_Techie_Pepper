2007-06-25T13:33:00.000Z	raymondjtoth		what i got
2007-06-25T13:33:00.000Z	dotpavan	raymondjtoth	if you have the .sub file, vlc works
2007-06-25T13:40:00.000Z	dotpavan	raymondjtoth	so, you tried the subtitles option in vlc and it didnt work?
2007-06-25T13:41:00.000Z	dotpavan	raymondjtoth	sorry, couldnt get you.. 8.6b?
2007-06-25T13:42:00.000Z	dotpavan	raymondjtoth	totem works good, or smplayer
2007-06-25T13:44:00.000Z	dotpavan	raymondjtoth	you mean subtitles, right?
2007-06-25T13:47:00.000Z	dotpavan	raymondjtoth	hmmn, yes, subtitles.. I am not suire why it isnt working for you.. so you I presume you have a dvd and playing it in vlc, right? then check preferences-->video-->subtitles
2007-06-25T13:49:00.000Z	dotpavan	raymondjtoth	then I guess the dvd doesnt have that .sub file.. unless the dvd comes with the relavant .SUB file, it wont work.. you can dig the internet to dload a sub file for that media
2007-06-25T13:51:00.000Z	dotpavan	raymondjtoth	then you could give "totem" a try, or "smplayer" is also good.. see if they show you the subtitles
2007-06-25T13:52:00.000Z	dotpavan	raymondjtoth	totem is already installed
2007-06-25T13:53:00.000Z	dotpavan	raymondjtoth	what is the error? it plays the video or not?
2007-06-25T13:55:00.000Z	dotpavan	raymondjtoth	I guess vlc didnt exit properly, go to system monitor and kill vlc and esd
2007-06-25T13:55:00.000Z	dotpavan	raymondjtoth	go to system monitor.. the thing that shows your comp performance
2007-06-25T13:57:00.000Z	dotpavan	raymondjtoth	main menu-->system-->admin-->system monitor
2007-06-25T13:59:00.000Z	dotpavan	raymondjtoth	not there? wierd.. ok type this in terminal: "pkill vlc" and "pkill esd" (without the quotes) and try playing with totem
2007-06-25T14:04:00.000Z	dotpavan	raymondjtoth	so, what happened?
2007-06-25T14:05:00.000Z	dotpavan	raymondjtoth	ok, so you dont have multimedia codecs..
