2011-08-08T05:28:00.000Z	intrader		Anyone, I have a laptop where I was upgrading to 11.04 - I fount it with the Caps Lock light blinking, and the hardrive light on. Power down and try to reboot gets a Kernel Panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown block.
2011-08-08T05:29:00.000Z	urlin2u	intrader	was this a upgarde from another distro?
2011-08-08T05:29:00.000Z	intrader	urlin2u	yes, from 10.10
2011-08-08T05:30:00.000Z	urlin2u	intrader	escott makes a good suggestion, beyond that I would see if the HD mounts from a live cd and pull out what you need and do a fresh install.
2011-08-08T05:35:00.000Z	urlin2u	intrader	I think escott will know more about checking the hardware.
2011-08-08T05:39:00.000Z	urlin2u	intrader	hit ctrl-f put in the nd and search to find al lthe posts of that nic
2011-08-10T22:46:00.000Z	urlin2u	intrader	a dist-upgrade is a safe move generally.
2011-08-10T22:47:00.000Z	urlin2u	intrader	you might comsider having a image of a working setup in case you have problems.
2011-08-18T01:18:00.000Z	urlin2u	intrader	when you hit print there is a dropdown in the gui for where it is pointed.
2011-08-18T01:21:00.000Z	intrader	urlin2u	where? for example 'text edit' shows me Print to File - not the CUPS server printer on the mac
2011-08-18T01:23:00.000Z	urlin2u	intrader	what are you trying to print, open libre, and type a few thing and hit the not quick print and a gui should show.
2011-08-18T01:24:00.000Z	urlin2u	intrader	the file-printersetting in libre should show it.
2011-08-18T01:26:00.000Z	intrader	urlin2u	what is libre - I am trying open office and the print menus hangs.
2011-08-18T01:26:00.000Z	urlin2u	intrader	open office the same in the file tab is printer settings
2011-08-18T01:27:00.000Z	intrader	urlin2u	Print is still hanging
2011-08-18T01:28:00.000Z	urlin2u	intrader	I know with mine I have a old HP Black and white printer the driver is not exctly the one ubuntu suggests, mine has a plus at end the driver I use has all other identification - the plus.
2011-08-18T01:28:00.000Z	intrader	urlin2u	I kill it, Printer Settings also hangs
2011-08-18T01:29:00.000Z	urlin2u	intrader	that is about all I know that I have posted. ;(
2011-08-18T01:30:00.000Z	intrader	urlin2u	I kill that also, trying  Text Edit - it gives me only Print to File option
2011-08-18T01:31:00.000Z	urlin2u	intrader	that is about all I know that I have posted. ;(
2011-08-18T01:31:00.000Z	intrader	urlin2u	np
