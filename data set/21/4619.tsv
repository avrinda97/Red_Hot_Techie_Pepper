2008-07-06T22:25:00.000Z	XLV		anyone here with a amd/ati radeon card? thinking of switching from nvidia to a radeon 4850, need to know whats the quality and stability of the radeon closed source drivers.. also how well dual view is implemented? i have two displays, a 24" and a 22" tft lcd, to connect to the card
2008-07-06T22:26:00.000Z	m-c	XLV	Yes, I can help you with that
2008-07-06T22:27:00.000Z	m-c	XLV	You should know that AMD released the specification for almost all the ATI-model cards, earlier this year, and there are Free Software drivers being written for them at a furious pace.  You can already try out the developer versions of these open drivers, and the drivers for R500 chips and older will be built into the next version of Ubuntu
2008-07-06T22:29:00.000Z	XLV	m-c	but do there drivers support 4850/70? and if they dont, or they need more polish, how well closed source amdati drivers work?
2008-07-06T22:30:00.000Z	m-c	XLV	Yes the drivers will support the 4850/70 cards, although efforts appear to be starting with earlier released cards.  The closed drivers are notoriously poor, on the other hand.
2008-07-06T22:31:00.000Z	XLV	m-c	as i see it not even the closed source drivers support 4850/70
2008-07-06T22:31:00.000Z	XLV	m-c	so i guess i should hold off the purchase
2008-07-06T22:32:00.000Z	m-c	XLV	I purchased a 3650 and I found it difficult to get dual monitors working with the closed drivers.  The open drivers had no problems, but there is no 3D support for R600 chips, yet.
2008-07-06T22:33:00.000Z	XLV	m-c	got some link of the website of ati oss drivers?
2008-07-06T22:34:00.000Z	XLV	m-c	nm, i found it
2008-07-06T22:35:00.000Z	m-c	XLV	http://wiki.x.org/wiki/RadeonFeature ; http://www.phoronix.com/forums/showthread.php?s=844e52238b85865d489a98d68b85e322&t=9951
2008-07-06T22:42:00.000Z	XLV	m-c	seems theres support for 4850/70 in catalyst 8.6 linux drivers http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=amd_catalyst_86&num=1
2008-07-06T22:44:00.000Z	m-c	XLV	The closed drivers do seem to be ready from AMD, from that link information.
2008-07-06T22:45:00.000Z	XLV	m-c	think i am getting it... 4850 for 150 euro here
2008-07-06T22:46:00.000Z	m-c	XLV	Plus, you can know there will be open drivers coming in the near future.
2008-07-06T22:46:00.000Z	XLV	m-c	yeah, i suppose we can count on it
2008-07-06T22:46:00.000Z	XLV	m-c	if only they had some uvd support out, i would yank that 6600gt out of the htpc in no time
2008-07-06T22:47:00.000Z	m-c	XLV	I upgraded from a 6600GT with dual monitors.  The open R600 works for me fine, even without yet having the 3D support
2008-07-06T22:48:00.000Z	XLV	m-c	yeah, i mean if ati had h264/vc1 gpu accelerated decoding out
2008-07-06T22:49:00.000Z	XLV	m-c	but i suppose they'll do it, sooner than nvidia at least
2008-07-06T22:49:00.000Z	m-c	XLV	*wishes for Ogg Theora decoding support*  ;)
