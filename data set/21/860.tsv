2011-08-13T22:25:00.000Z	escott	nessonic	and your dyndns is resolving to your public ip
2011-08-13T22:28:00.000Z	escott	nessonic	login to your router and see what it states as the public ip, and compare that to what your dyndns is sending you to
2011-08-13T22:29:00.000Z	nessonic	escott	it's the same
2011-08-13T22:30:00.000Z	escott	nessonic	if you have a firewall it might be blocking frmo external ip addresses, but not local
2011-08-13T22:31:00.000Z	nessonic	escott	the firewall on my mac is off, and if my linux box (hosting the ssh) has a firewall I've never messed with it
2011-08-13T22:32:00.000Z	escott	nessonic	you can run sudo iptable -L and see if there are any rules
2011-08-13T23:47:00.000Z	escott	nessonic	did you add iptables as a service (so it can be saved on shutdown)
2011-08-13T23:49:00.000Z	escott	nessonic	you may find that !ufw is easier to work with
2011-08-13T23:51:00.000Z	escott	nessonic	you have to modify /etc/ssh/sshd_config to disable that
2011-08-13T23:52:00.000Z	escott	nessonic	sorry misread s/without/with/. what does ssh -vvv say?
2011-08-13T23:53:00.000Z	nessonic	escott	it comes out with a list of options (correct use typical message)
2011-08-13T23:58:00.000Z	nessonic	escott	also, which option in sshd_config for password entry? there is #PasswordAuthentication yes, but the comment line above says putting this as no will make clear text across the network
2011-08-14T00:00:00.000Z	nessonic	escott	How would I fix that?
2011-08-14T00:01:00.000Z	escott	nessonic	i dont know exactly what does ssh -vvv say as it performs the login. it should say exactly where it got the key and why it was allowed in
2011-08-14T00:02:00.000Z	escott	nessonic	you add your public key to the .authorized_keys of the remote host, and then prove that you have possession of the corresponding private key in your .ssh
2011-08-14T00:03:00.000Z	escott	nessonic	so you need .ssh/id_rsa on the client, and id_rsa.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys on the remote server
2011-08-14T00:04:00.000Z	nessonic	escott	should I use rsa? I've been using dsa
2011-08-14T00:04:00.000Z	escott	nessonic	honestly i dont know the answer to that. rsa is just the default
2011-08-14T00:05:00.000Z	nessonic	escott	I just find it odd it's still letting me in when there are no keys on either end
2011-08-14T00:05:00.000Z	escott	nessonic	http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-security-4/which-is-better-rsa-or-dsa-public-key-12593/
2011-08-14T00:06:00.000Z	escott	nessonic	i would suspect you removed the wrong files. alternately your ssh-agent could be caching the keys that it saw previously
