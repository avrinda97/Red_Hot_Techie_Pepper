2008-06-27T04:37:00.000Z	Sithe		I upgraded to 8.04 now when ever I log in it just hangs there at a blank orange screen.
2008-06-27T04:37:00.000Z	ShadowKnight	Sithe	did you try running in the command line?
2008-06-27T04:37:00.000Z	Sithe	ShadowKnight	How does one do that? O:
2008-06-27T04:38:00.000Z	ShadowKnight		Sithe:ã€€ctrl-alt-F1 will open a command line.
2008-06-27T04:38:00.000Z	Sithe	ShadowKnight	I'll try it hold on
2008-06-27T04:39:00.000Z	ShadowKnight		Um Sithe, if you're still there... ctrl-alt-f7 will get you back to the GUI...
2008-06-27T04:40:00.000Z	Sithe	ShadowKnight	Yes the command line opens
2008-06-27T04:40:00.000Z	ShadowKnight		Can you log in, Sithe?
2008-06-27T04:40:00.000Z	Sithe	ShadowKnight	I could already from the GUI. But AFTER I login in it just hangs at that orange screen (the one before the desktop loads). So basically the desktop doesn't load.
2008-06-27T04:41:00.000Z	ShadowKnight		Right, Sithe, so what I'm saying is that if you can run everything normally from the command line, the install is probably fine, but you don't have the right video drivers.
2008-06-27T04:42:00.000Z	Sithe	ShadowKnight	 Ohh =\
2008-06-27T04:42:00.000Z	Sithe	ShadowKnight	Is there a command to get the right ones?
2008-06-27T04:42:00.000Z	ShadowKnight	Sithe	what video card are you running?
2008-06-27T04:42:00.000Z	Sithe	ShadowKnight	I honestly have no idea. Its an old laptop with an integrated graphics card.
2008-06-27T04:43:00.000Z	ShadowKnight	Sithe	Hmm. Well that's a problem since there are different drivers for different cards.
2008-06-27T04:44:00.000Z	Sithe	ShadowKnight	It was working fine before the upgrade
2008-06-27T04:44:00.000Z	ShadowKnight	Sithe	I'm not too experienced with video drivers, so you'd better ask someone else, but I suggest you do as was said above and try booting in safe mode and see what happens.
2008-06-27T04:45:00.000Z	Sithe	ShadowKnight	Agi Radeon RV250
2008-06-27T04:45:00.000Z	Sithe	ShadowKnight	Wups ATI*
2008-06-27T04:46:00.000Z	Sithe		Spoonman: Thanks
2008-06-27T04:46:00.000Z	ShadowKnight	Sithe	I run an Nvidia, so I definitely can't help you... Sorry.
