2005-07-16T09:32:00.000Z	jasoncohen	qt2	apt is just the package management tool. it's the repositories that contain the software you want.
2005-07-16T09:34:00.000Z	qt2	jasoncohen	i realize that.
2005-07-16T09:34:00.000Z	jasoncohen	qt2	just clarifying as you said apt is missing a lot
2005-07-16T09:34:00.000Z	qt2	jasoncohen	i was complaining about the ubuntu repositories... but i was too lazy to type that out :P
2005-07-16T09:34:00.000Z	jasoncohen	qt2	you just have to enable universe
2005-07-16T09:35:00.000Z	jasoncohen	qt2	http://www.ubuntulinux.org/ubuntu/components
2005-07-16T09:35:00.000Z	qt2	jasoncohen	i have it enabled. :P
2005-07-16T09:35:00.000Z	jasoncohen	qt2	and you might also want multiverse for some multimedia stuff
2005-07-16T09:36:00.000Z	jasoncohen	qt2	so is universe
2005-07-30T14:54:00.000Z	jasoncohen	qt2	right click on any panel you have and choose new panel
2005-07-30T14:54:00.000Z	jasoncohen	qt2	then right click on the new panel and choose add to panel
2005-07-30T14:55:00.000Z	qt2	jasoncohen	that just give me a blank panel, i'm looking for a quick way to resote the default ubuntu panel...
2005-07-30T14:56:00.000Z	jasoncohen	qt2	i don't know if there is a way, but it's not hard to do yourself
2005-07-30T14:56:00.000Z	jasoncohen	qt2	first add a menu bar, and then application launchers and then you can add a clock, volume control, network & power monitors on the right side
