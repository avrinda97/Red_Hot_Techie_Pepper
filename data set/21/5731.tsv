2007-09-08T05:21:00.000Z	steel_lady		people, what's the time? Since we installed feisty, both of our computer clocks went nutts!!!
2007-09-08T05:22:00.000Z	wanger	steel_lady	1122 GMT, i've had some fun with system clocks during installs =)
2007-09-08T05:23:00.000Z	steel_lady	wanger	are you sure?
2007-09-08T05:23:00.000Z	wanger	steel_lady	yep, 1223 BST where i am
2007-09-08T05:24:00.000Z	steel_lady	wanger	ok now I feel better
2007-09-08T05:25:00.000Z	wanger	steel_lady	hehe good stuff, the problem i had was that my system clock was too far out for ntpdate to sync it for me, so i just had to do it manually once
2007-09-08T05:26:00.000Z	steel_lady	wanger	I did it manually for my bf but he told me it went crazy again the next day
2007-09-08T05:26:00.000Z	steel_lady		and I already thought that I am crazy and lost 5 hours
2007-09-08T05:26:00.000Z	wanger	steel_lady	does he dual-boot?
2007-09-08T05:27:00.000Z	wanger	steel_lady	with windows i mean..
2007-09-08T05:27:00.000Z	steel_lady	wanger	yes
2007-09-08T05:28:00.000Z	steel_lady	wanger	but I think he wasn't booting in win these days
2007-09-08T05:28:00.000Z	steel_lady		it has something to do with it?
2007-09-08T05:29:00.000Z	wanger	steel_lady	that'll probably be it, windows handles time in a more primitive way than linux, always insists on the hardware clock being at local time, whereas linux keeps the hardware clock at UTC and just deals with it
2007-09-08T05:29:00.000Z	steel_lady	wanger	5 hours?
2007-09-08T05:30:00.000Z	wanger	steel_lady	although linux can (has to so windows doesn't fuck it over) do both
2007-09-08T05:30:00.000Z	wanger	steel_lady	depends where you live
2007-09-08T05:31:00.000Z	wanger	steel_lady	and the time of year, i found it a bit of a nightmare to wrap my brain around what was going on =)
2007-09-08T05:31:00.000Z	steel_lady	wanger	but I think it also might be the battery in his case
2007-09-08T05:33:00.000Z	wanger	steel_lady	i'd say that's unlikely if your clock's out by ~exactly 5 hours, which i'd imagine it is
2007-09-08T05:34:00.000Z	steel_lady	wanger	he is not at home now and i don't remember if it was 5 hours exactly
