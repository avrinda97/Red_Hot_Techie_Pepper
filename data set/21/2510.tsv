2011-11-19T16:59:00.000Z	Beefcakes		hello, I have added this ppa: https://launchpad.net/~intuitivenipple/+archive/ppa but I can't seem to do apt-get install r5u870-dkms (one of the packages there)
2011-11-19T17:00:00.000Z	theadmin	Beefcakes	Are you sure that this package is available for your Ubuntu version?
2011-11-19T17:01:00.000Z	Beefcakes	theadmin	i actually dont know much of what I'm doing, the drivers of my laptop's webcam are supposedly in this PPA.
2011-11-19T17:03:00.000Z	theadmin	Beefcakes	I see, did you check Ubuntu's "restricted drivers" tool?
2011-11-19T17:03:00.000Z	Beefcakes	theadmin	where can I find that? upon refreshing laptop I remmeber this worked last time but I was using an older version
2011-11-19T17:04:00.000Z	theadmin	Beefcakes	Eh, I'm honestly not sure, which Ubuntu version are you running?
2011-11-19T17:04:00.000Z	Beefcakes	theadmin	the latest I think. whats that command again to find out?
2011-11-19T17:04:00.000Z	theadmin	Beefcakes	That'd be "lsb_release -sc"
2011-11-19T17:05:00.000Z	theadmin	Beefcakes	Well, then it's under System -> Administration -> Hardware Drivers
2011-11-19T17:06:00.000Z	Beefcakes	theadmin	the window just says No proprietary drivers are in use on this ysstem
2011-11-19T17:06:00.000Z	theadmin	Beefcakes	I see, hm, well.
2011-11-19T17:06:00.000Z	Beefcakes	theadmin	nothing for me to reset
2011-11-19T17:06:00.000Z	theadmin	Beefcakes	I assume you have verified your camera ain't working with the standard software set?
2011-11-19T17:06:00.000Z	Beefcakes	theadmin	yes cheese, xawtv both dont work
2011-11-19T17:08:00.000Z	theadmin	Beefcakes	I see, well, honestly, no idea >.<
2011-11-19T17:10:00.000Z	Beefcakes	theadmin	its fine. would you have any idea why I am not able to get the r5u870-dkms package from https://launchpad.net/~intuitivenipple/+archive/ppa?
2011-11-19T17:11:00.000Z	theadmin	Beefcakes	There is no such package for your Ubuntu version in this PPA.
2011-11-19T17:12:00.000Z	Beefcakes	theadmin	oh crap, then updating to lucid was bad :|
2011-11-19T17:13:00.000Z	theadmin	Beefcakes	Probably you should find another PPA, this one seems to be rather old
2011-11-19T17:15:00.000Z	Beefcakes	theadmin	would you happen to know a workaround for me to at least get to that r5u870-dkms folder? I saw a few commands that might work
2011-11-19T17:15:00.000Z	theadmin	Beefcakes	Sorry, I'm not going to help you break your system by installing a package from another Ubuntu version.
