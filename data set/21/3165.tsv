2009-03-29T18:38:00.000Z	regtech		are there any security experts here/
2009-03-29T18:39:00.000Z	regtech		nathan, I am trying to locate the source of a script, how do i do that?
2009-03-29T18:39:00.000Z	regtech		I have checked, rc.local, rc.sysinit, /etc/crontab /etc/cron* and /etc/init.rc*
2009-03-29T18:40:00.000Z	regtech		its an ebay script
2009-03-29T18:40:00.000Z	regtech		I found a process phython ebcript "random name"
2009-03-29T18:41:00.000Z	regtech		how do i find it launching them, after i killed the processes, i rebooted the system, no sign of the scripts, but then a day later they came back
2009-03-29T18:41:00.000Z	jrib	regtech	I'd start by finding the location of the script
2009-03-29T18:41:00.000Z	regtech		so now im using crontab to laucnh my counter script which hunts down the processes and kills them, but its just putting water on a fire, i need to find the source of this
2009-03-29T18:42:00.000Z	regtech		i have found the location, /var/www/html
2009-03-29T18:42:00.000Z	jrib	regtech	then I'd look at the script and figure out why it is there.
2009-03-29T18:43:00.000Z	regtech		its there because someone hacked in and installed it
2009-03-29T18:43:00.000Z	regtech		its on someone elses system.
2009-03-29T18:43:00.000Z	jrib	regtech	wipe the drive and reinstall then
2009-03-29T18:44:00.000Z	regtech		sure, i agree, but its complicated
2009-03-29T18:44:00.000Z	regtech		i need to find out whats spawning it
2009-03-29T18:44:00.000Z	jrib	regtech	it's not really complicated. It's impossible to know what else has been done
2009-03-29T18:44:00.000Z	regtech		is there anyway of tracing back?
2009-03-29T18:44:00.000Z	regtech	jrib	you dont know the circumstances
2009-03-29T18:45:00.000Z	regtech		thanks mate
2009-03-29T18:45:00.000Z	regtech		i was about to ask about literature on this .
2009-03-29T18:45:00.000Z	jrib	regtech	I'm just telling you what I would do.  Regardless of the circumstances, you can no longer trust that system
