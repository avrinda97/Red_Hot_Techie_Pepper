2011-11-12T06:55:00.000Z	Guest91034		How can I locate Applications/System Tools in Ubuntu 11.10?
2011-11-12T06:56:00.000Z	Guest91034		When I type System Tools nothing happens
2011-11-12T06:58:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest91034	do you have pulse audio installed?
2011-11-12T06:58:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest91034	i would make disabling pulse audio a last resort
2011-11-12T07:00:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest91034	step 1. verify pulse audio installed... is it installed?
2011-11-12T07:00:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest91034	opena terminal and   sudo apt-get install pulseaudio
2011-11-12T07:00:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest91034	if its not installed, it will install
2011-11-12T07:01:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest91034	ok   now   sudo apt-get install pavucontrol
2011-11-12T07:01:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest91034	is that installing?
2011-11-12T07:02:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest91034	ok, now... go to the dashboard and search for "Pulse Audio"   and you should find "pulse audio volume control"
2011-11-12T07:03:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest91034	just to be clear, you're not doing something stupid, like using a USB headset/speakers.
2011-11-12T07:06:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest91034	if you play an audio file...  does the bottom "bounce".... as if the audio is playing on yoru system (just not coming through on your headphones)
2011-11-12T07:06:00.000Z	Guest91034	KM0201	yes the slider bar goes up and down
2011-11-12T07:07:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest91034	not the slider
2011-11-12T07:07:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest91034	ok
2011-11-12T07:07:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest91034	try this.. go to the "configuration" tab
2011-11-12T07:07:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest91034	well no kidding.
2011-11-12T07:08:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest91034	on the configuration tab, what is your setting there?\
2011-11-12T07:09:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest91034	mine is set to analog stereo duplex, and it works fine.
2011-11-12T07:10:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest91034	now that i don't know.
2011-11-12T07:11:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest91034	you can try doing some googling, see if anything turns up.
