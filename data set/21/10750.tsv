2004-11-28T07:53:00.000Z	scoon	Kamion	$PATH works just fine
2004-11-28T07:53:00.000Z	Kamion	scoon	no it's not
2004-11-28T07:53:00.000Z	scoon	Kamion	try and see
2004-11-28T07:53:00.000Z	Kamion	scoon	you get an error message that happens to include it, but echo is most certainly not implied
2004-11-28T07:55:00.000Z	Kamion	scoon	typing just $PATH at a shell means "please expand the environment variable PATH and attempt to execute the result as a command"
2004-11-28T07:55:00.000Z	scoon	Kamion	yes I know that.  but for someone who is new to linux, does it really matter.
2004-11-28T07:56:00.000Z	scoon	Kamion	i didn't think that i did.  the poor guy doesn't know that his java is not in his path.  why should i clutter his problems with more things ?
2004-11-28T07:57:00.000Z	Kamion	scoon	sure, I'm just advocating correct shell
2004-11-28T07:57:00.000Z	Kamion	scoon	(since I spend much of my time battling incorrect shell)
2004-11-28T07:57:00.000Z	scoon	Kamion	well in a pinch i just use $PATH without even thinking about it.
2004-11-28T07:57:00.000Z	Kamion	scoon	that's very odd practice :)
2004-11-28T07:57:00.000Z	scoon	Kamion	understood.
2004-11-28T07:58:00.000Z	scoon	Kamion	not really.  just few key strokes.
2004-11-28T07:58:00.000Z	Kamion	scoon	call me a pedant if you like, but I prefer valid commands to intentional errors. :-)
2004-11-28T07:59:00.000Z	scoon	Kamion	sure, sure.  this was such a trivial thing.
2004-11-30T16:59:00.000Z	scoon	Kamion	I understand that I can pin a version to use.  which would be fine, but the src version is identical to the binary version.
2004-11-30T16:59:00.000Z	scoon	Kamion	to change the version, should i do that in the .dsc file and then rename the .deb to match ?
2004-11-30T17:05:00.000Z	scoon	Kamion	edit the .changes file that gets created ?
2004-11-30T17:08:00.000Z	scoon	Kamion	ok, i think that is my question, what/where is the debian/changelog
2004-11-30T17:16:00.000Z	scoon	Kamion	what am i changing in the change log ?
2004-11-30T17:30:00.000Z	scoon	Kamion	that worked, thx
