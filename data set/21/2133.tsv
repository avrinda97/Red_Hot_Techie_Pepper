2010-01-07T22:31:00.000Z	Deathspike		Does anyone know how I can manage services? I lack the services manager.
2010-01-07T22:31:00.000Z	Mortal_	Deathspike	check out /etc/init.d/, it contains services, not sure if all of them are there
2010-01-07T22:32:00.000Z	Mortal_	Deathspike	also try service --status-all
2010-01-07T22:33:00.000Z	Deathspike	Mortal_	: No 'services' was found, I guess the command isnt known either.
2010-01-07T22:33:00.000Z	Mortal_	Deathspike	what do you mean no 'services' was found? did the service tool tell you that? huh
2010-01-07T22:33:00.000Z	Deathspike	Mortal_	No, the tool doesnt even exist on my system.
2010-01-07T22:33:00.000Z	Mortal_	Deathspike	'service' is the standard way of managing services (daemons) in ubuntu... try 'man service'
2010-01-07T22:34:00.000Z	Deathspike	Mortal_	My bad, typo. How can I remove gdm (it has a ?) from the services via command line? :)
2010-01-07T22:35:00.000Z	Deathspike	Mortal_	I dont want to uninstall it, I just want to disable it as I'm running a server and dont need GUI all the time.
2010-01-07T22:36:00.000Z	Deathspike	Mortal_	: Hm.. apparently it doesn't know the service, even though it's listed.. twice.
2010-01-07T22:36:00.000Z	Mortal_	Deathspike	what about sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop?
2010-01-07T22:37:00.000Z	Deathspike	Mortal_	It closes now, but AFAIK it re-appears when I reboot.
2010-01-07T22:38:00.000Z	Deathspike	Mortal_	Sadly, I already did this. It still re-appears :\
2010-01-07T22:38:00.000Z	Mortal_	Deathspike	check out update-rc.d
2010-01-07T22:38:00.000Z	Deathspike	Mortal_	I used sysv-rc-conf and manual deleting. No entries are around, it still starts.
2010-01-07T22:38:00.000Z	Deathspike	Mortal_	& rob_p: This command throws an error at line 57 :\
2010-01-07T22:38:00.000Z	Mortal_	Deathspike	you shouldn't delete it, you need to rename it according to some shenanigans, but update-rc.d should do that for you
2010-01-07T22:39:00.000Z	Deathspike	Mortal_	A reinstall should do the trick for corruption I take it then?
2010-01-07T22:40:00.000Z	Mortal_	Deathspike	what's corrupted?
2010-01-07T22:40:00.000Z	Deathspike	Mortal_	: update-rc.d gives an error at line 57 for some reason.
2010-01-07T22:44:00.000Z	Deathspike	Mortal_	This is still a no-go :(
