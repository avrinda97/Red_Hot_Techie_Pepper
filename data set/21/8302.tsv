2006-05-04T13:46:00.000Z	random_guy		so that would mean it just needs some xorg.conf settings right?

2006-05-04T13:47:00.000Z	random_guy		it tries to start and cant
2006-05-04T13:48:00.000Z	random_guy		i get a blue screen that says it cant start
2006-05-04T13:48:00.000Z	random_guy		hmmm i didnt specify one
2006-05-04T13:49:00.000Z	random_guy		raptros you dont even get a command line?
2006-05-04T13:49:00.000Z	random_guy		could i possibly copy the monitor section generated by my desktop on the same monitor and copy it to the ibook's xorg.conf?
