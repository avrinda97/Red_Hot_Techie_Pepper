2008-11-29T20:17:00.000Z	Sk8rdude	n8tuser	command not found... ??
2008-11-29T20:08:00.000Z	Sk8rdude	n8tuser	the switch tells the server tthe max user limit is 10... when i log in a second time it fails because the max user limit has been reached
2008-11-29T20:11:00.000Z	Sk8rdude	n8tuser	i would agree but that switch is also specified in my startup line at 5
2008-11-29T20:11:00.000Z	Sk8rdude	n8tuser	even when i take both switches out of the line and start the server it defaults to 1 when the man says it should be 50
2008-11-29T20:12:00.000Z	Sk8rdude	n8tuser	it doesn't make a difference with ip... ive tried logins from different machines
2008-11-29T20:13:00.000Z	Sk8rdude	n8tuser	can i pm?
2008-11-29T20:18:00.000Z	Sk8rdude	n8tuser	sudo: cat/proc/3189/cmdline: command not found
2008-11-29T20:20:00.000Z	Sk8rdude	n8tuser	'pure-ftpd (SERVER)' so that would suggest it's not using any switches; yet i know it is using some because one switch defines the port to accept connections which i know is working
2008-11-30T23:16:00.000Z	Sk8rdude	n8tuser	i'm looking at the man pages of s/ltrace... what would the useage be?
2008-11-30T23:19:00.000Z	Sk8rdude	n8tuser	--- SIGSTOP (Stopped (signal)) ---
2008-11-30T23:25:00.000Z	Sk8rdude	n8tuser	the app (an ftpd) appears to accept the connection and check nothing before rejecting it... i don't see how this can help
2008-11-30T23:28:00.000Z	Sk8rdude	n8tuser	i just don't get why it listens to some switches on startup but not others... i specify some things which work fine (port change) but others don't (user limit)
2008-11-30T23:32:00.000Z	Sk8rdude	n8tuser	i just don't get why it listens to some switches on startup but not others... i specify some things which work fine (port change) but others don't (user limit)
2008-11-30T23:35:00.000Z	Sk8rdude	n8tuser	no, it uses puredb for auth
2008-11-30T23:35:00.000Z	Sk8rdude	n8tuser	pure-ftpd
2008-11-30T23:36:00.000Z	Sk8rdude	n8tuser	even with the user limit switch removed it should default to 50 but it's still locked to 1 for some reason
2008-11-30T23:37:00.000Z	Sk8rdude	n8tuser	yes, i tried re-compiling yesterday
2008-11-30T23:38:00.000Z	Sk8rdude	n8tuser	pure-ftpd doesnt use a conf file
2008-11-30T23:39:00.000Z	Sk8rdude	n8tuser	it just uses switches in the start line when you boot it
2008-11-30T23:40:00.000Z	Sk8rdude	n8tuser	the file is empty/doesnt exist
2008-11-30T23:43:00.000Z	Sk8rdude	n8tuser	the file doesnt exist
