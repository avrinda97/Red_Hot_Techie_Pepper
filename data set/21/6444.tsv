2008-01-10T02:07:00.000Z	matt___		odd - is /etc/apt/sources.list supposed to reference edgy all over the place?
2008-01-10T02:07:00.000Z	Slart	matt___	you're running gutsy? are the lines with edgy commented out?
2008-01-10T02:08:00.000Z	matt___	Slart	no, I'm running 7/4 (feisty?)  and no, they're not commented out.
2008-01-10T02:09:00.000Z	Slart	matt___	hmm.. then I guess.. no.. there shouldn't be edgy all over the place in your sources.list.. not afaik
2008-01-10T02:10:00.000Z	matt___	Slart	should it be gutsy?
2008-01-10T02:10:00.000Z	Slart	matt___	does your computer work? run "lsb_release -a" in a terminal.. what does it say?
2008-01-10T02:11:00.000Z	matt___	Slart	yeah, it works fine otherwise - it tells me that I'm on feisty.
2008-01-10T02:11:00.000Z	Slart	matt___	can you pastebin your sources.list ?

2008-01-10T02:15:00.000Z	matt___	Slart	anything weird in there?  Should it be gutsy?  or feisty?
