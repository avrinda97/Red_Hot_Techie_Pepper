2010-01-27T05:57:00.000Z	Alan502		Hi, My kdm messed up :\. I installed ratpoison and fluxbox some days ago but it was until today that i logged in with fluxbox. I didn't like it so i logged out and chose KDE again. When i logged in, a white... black.. weird screen appeared only showing my mouse clearly. I removed fluxbox and ratpoison from a different tty and rebooted to see if that would help but my screen is still with those weird colors. I'm on irssi now!
2010-01-27T05:58:00.000Z	Alan502		Please help!
2010-01-27T05:58:00.000Z	Alan502		I'm using kubuntu, btw
2010-01-27T05:59:00.000Z	obladda	Alan502	You probably have to select KDE as the session from the kdm login
2010-01-27T05:59:00.000Z	obladda	Alan502	reselect
2010-01-27T06:12:00.000Z	obladda	Alan502	What happened when you reselected KDE as your x session at the KDM login screen?
2010-01-27T06:13:00.000Z	Alan502	obladda	the same... it's just a white screen that then turns black, and the only thing i can see clearly is my mouse pointer. Kde kind of tries to show the windows and menus though, when i try to like click then K a little white shadow is shown for a second
2010-01-27T06:14:00.000Z	obladda	Alan502	It's compositing
2010-01-27T06:14:00.000Z	obladda	Alan502	You have to restart kwin from a terminal while the white screen is up
2010-01-27T06:15:00.000Z	obladda	Alan502	killall kwin;kwin --replace
2010-01-27T06:18:00.000Z	Alan502	obladda	when i run "kwin --replace" it says "kwin: Cannot connect to X server." This worked tho, Now i can see my kde as it was before =D thanks!
2010-01-27T06:18:00.000Z	Alan502	obladda	brb rebooting
2010-01-27T06:27:00.000Z	Alan502	obladda	thanks, i got my kde running now
2010-01-27T06:28:00.000Z	obladda	Alan502	forgot the export DISPLAY=:0
2010-01-27T06:28:00.000Z	obladda	Alan502	np
2010-01-27T06:28:00.000Z	Alan502	obladda	but i have to run killall kwin and kwin --replace (besides leaving the kwin --replace terminal open) everytime i boot
2010-01-27T06:29:00.000Z	obladda	Alan502	Shouldn't have to. I find it easier to bind it to a global key combination in KDE control panel
2010-01-27T06:29:00.000Z	obladda	Alan502	That way you don't have to export the DISPLAY and can restart kwin anytime
2010-01-27T06:30:00.000Z	Alan502	obladda	so i add all these to the kde start?
2010-01-27T06:31:00.000Z	obladda	Alan502	I used to have to but the current kernel and nvidia drivers work for me most of the time
2010-01-27T06:32:00.000Z	Alan502	obladda	i'm using the lastest kernel avaible in the updates and nvidia 9 series drivers, this messed up after using fluxbox
