2005-09-26T12:02:00.000Z	adjacent	pythonscript	if you want it to start when the machine boots, put the script in /etc/init.d/ and use update-rc.conf to add the links in the the appropriate runlevels
2005-09-26T12:03:00.000Z	pythonscript		actually I want to start the script everytime login no only when boot, because I want the network functional first

2005-09-26T12:03:00.000Z	adjacent	pythonscript	you might want to read up on runlevels before you go any further, you are trying to do accomplish something the wrong way
