2011-07-12T20:19:00.000Z	KNUBBIG		Btw I hate installing Nvidia drivers on Debian :D
2011-07-12T20:20:00.000Z	cantor	KNUBBIG	from source or .deb?
2011-07-12T20:20:00.000Z	KNUBBIG	cantor	from .run
2011-07-12T20:20:00.000Z	cantor	KNUBBIG	that does suck
2011-07-12T20:20:00.000Z	KNUBBIG	cantor	I got it to install but nvidia-xconfig created a config which doesn't work at all with anything. startx -> monitor loses signal -> reset button :D
2011-07-12T20:21:00.000Z	cantor	KNUBBIG	are you running X when you install?
2011-07-12T20:21:00.000Z	KNUBBIG	cantor	nope
2011-07-12T20:22:00.000Z	cantor	KNUBBIG	is it an old card?
2011-07-12T20:22:00.000Z	KNUBBIG	cantor	not that much, gtx 280
2011-07-12T20:25:00.000Z	cantor	KNUBBIG	what driver version are you using?
2011-07-12T20:26:00.000Z	KNUBBIG	cantor	one Moment, I'll have to look that up
2011-07-12T20:27:00.000Z	KNUBBIG	cantor	I installed 275.09.07
2011-07-12T20:30:00.000Z	cantor	KNUBBIG	Im not sure with debian and that card
2011-07-12T20:31:00.000Z	KNUBBIG	cantor	okay, thanks. I will try to install the one from the repo
2011-07-12T20:35:00.000Z	KNUBBIG	cantor	any idea which package I have to install? nvidia-glx ?
2011-07-12T20:40:00.000Z	cantor	KNUBBIG	not sure
2011-07-12T20:41:00.000Z	KNUBBIG	cantor	well I'll have to find it out ;-) With the open source drivers, everything worked 'fine' (except for the bad performance)
2011-07-12T20:42:00.000Z	cantor	KNUBBIG	I have not used debian as a desktop for sometime.  Maybe the debian IRC channel?
2011-07-12T20:42:00.000Z	KNUBBIG	cantor	will try that, already tried the xen channel, thanks :)
2011-07-12T20:43:00.000Z	cantor	KNUBBIG	server irc.debian.org
