2010-07-03T09:16:00.000Z	Te3-BloodyIron		can anyone please help me with my problem?
2010-07-03T09:16:00.000Z	Te3-BloodyIron		nobody is addressing me
2010-07-03T09:17:00.000Z	tertl3	Te3-BloodyIron	ok, whats up?
2010-07-03T09:17:00.000Z	Te3-BloodyIron		so i upgraded to ub 10.04
2010-07-03T09:17:00.000Z	Te3-BloodyIron		and i tried to run mythtv-frontend a few minutes ago and it complained about a vdpau issue
2010-07-03T09:17:00.000Z	Te3-BloodyIron		so i figured hey maybe i should just reinstall the frontend
2010-07-03T09:17:00.000Z	Te3-BloodyIron		so i removed all the mythtv packages on this system (not my backend)
2010-07-03T09:17:00.000Z	Te3-BloodyIron		and now it's not showing up in my package manager
2010-07-03T09:18:00.000Z	tertl3	Te3-BloodyIron	i have absolutely no idea, but did you search the bugzilla on launchpad?
2010-07-03T09:18:00.000Z	Te3-BloodyIron		i've rebooted and reloaded the sources a couple times, no luck
2010-07-03T09:18:00.000Z	tertl3	Te3-BloodyIron	maybe its not in the new repos?
2010-07-03T09:18:00.000Z	Te3-BloodyIron		i've googled it and couldn't come up with worthwhile keywords, i assume it also crawled bugzilla
2010-07-03T09:18:00.000Z	Te3-BloodyIron		but no i have not directly consulted bugzilla
2010-07-03T09:18:00.000Z	Te3-BloodyIron	tertl3	why would they remove mythtv from the repos?
2010-07-03T09:19:00.000Z	tertl3	Te3-BloodyIron	i would search the official docs in launchpad
2010-07-03T09:19:00.000Z	tertl3	Te3-BloodyIron	idk, do you have a better explination
2010-07-03T09:19:00.000Z	Te3-BloodyIron		is there anything else i can do in the mean time?
2010-07-03T09:19:00.000Z	tertl3	Te3-BloodyIron	is there a Mythtv wiki or anyithng?
2010-07-03T09:20:00.000Z	Te3-BloodyIron		this isn't a myth issue, it's an ubuntu issue
2010-07-03T09:20:00.000Z	tertl3	Te3-BloodyIron	official documentation is essentail for these things
2010-07-03T09:20:00.000Z	tertl3	Te3-BloodyIron	if all else fails, try Fedora :)  jk, but not really
