2005-06-16T09:57:00.000Z	deathwing		wow phyton, like c++ in windows
2005-06-16T09:58:00.000Z	bob2	deathwing	python isn't anything like C++
2005-06-16T09:58:00.000Z	bob2	deathwing	perl is even less like C++
2005-06-16T10:01:00.000Z	bob2	deathwing	python is simple if you know how to program in anything
2005-06-16T10:03:00.000Z	bob2	deathwing	it runs well on windows, too
2005-06-16T10:04:00.000Z	bob2	deathwing	you want to know of one site that is written in python?
2005-06-16T10:04:00.000Z	bob2	deathwing	http://launchpad.ubuntu.com/
2005-06-16T10:05:00.000Z	bob2	deathwing	no, not at all like webmin
2005-06-16T10:06:00.000Z	bob2	deathwing	webmin is the only other https site you've seen?
2005-06-16T10:08:00.000Z	bob2	deathwing	serious admins really don't use webmin
2005-06-16T10:25:00.000Z	bob2	deathwing	using it and hanging out here or on the mailing lists is a good way to learn lots
2005-06-16T10:26:00.000Z	bob2	deathwing	plus, then you get to learn from *other people's* mistakes, instead of having to make them yourself ;p
