2005-05-16T11:01:00.000Z	dabaSlon	jedipottsy306	hey, did anything change?
2005-05-16T11:02:00.000Z	dabaSlon	jedipottsy306	my last post meant....when you are mounting something, you are mounting a device(usually) onto a directory.
2005-05-16T11:04:00.000Z	jedipottsy306	dabaSlon	no nothing has changed
2005-05-16T11:04:00.000Z	dabaSlon	jedipottsy306	make a folder like I said, and mount /dev/cdrom onto it
2005-05-16T11:07:00.000Z	dabaSlon	jedipottsy306	anywhere you want to mount it
2005-05-16T11:10:00.000Z	dabaSlon	jedipottsy306	you created cd, and tried to mount to /cd, which is different
2005-05-16T11:10:00.000Z	jedipottsy306	dabaSlon	i did, but then it said no medium
