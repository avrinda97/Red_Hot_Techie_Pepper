2010-11-25T21:57:00.000Z	evilbug		my friend just made an ubuntu 10.10 install dvd and trying to boot it off of a win7 comp. the problem is the disc is recognized at boot and jumps straight into windows. could this be a bios issue?
2010-11-25T21:59:00.000Z	BluesKaj	evilbug	did your friend check the md5 sum on the dvd ..the problem may be witht the cdrom not reading the dvd and defaulting to the next boot device .
2010-11-25T22:00:00.000Z	evilbug	BluesKaj	the dvd is fine.
2010-11-25T22:00:00.000Z	BluesKaj	evilbug	have you tried it on another pc ?
2010-11-25T22:01:00.000Z	evilbug	BluesKaj	trying it right now but seems to be a bios issue since his other ubuntu computer recognizes it as a package disc.
2010-11-25T22:02:00.000Z	BluesKaj	evilbug	yes but will it boot on the other pc ?
2010-11-25T22:02:00.000Z	evilbug	BluesKaj	trying it right now, gonna confirm in a minute.
2010-11-25T22:02:00.000Z	BluesKaj	evilbug	ok
2010-11-25T22:02:00.000Z	evilbug	BluesKaj	i'm doing this over skype so it takes a bit :)
2010-11-25T22:08:00.000Z	evilbug	BluesKaj	eZet: the disc works. i have to go into the bios of the other computer.
2010-11-25T22:09:00.000Z	BluesKaj	evilbug	ok , I guess the boot sequence needs to be changed
2010-11-25T22:14:00.000Z	evilbug	BluesKaj	apparently f8, f10, or f12 doesn't work.
2010-11-25T22:15:00.000Z	BluesKaj	evilbug	have you tried entering the BIOS before ? ...I have to ask
2010-11-25T22:17:00.000Z	evilbug	BluesKaj	like i said, i'm doing this remotely and all i can do is give instructions. my buddy tells me that those 3 keys don't work when they're pressed at boot. and he also tells me there's no splash at first boot so he can't see what "f" key is rquired to enter the bios.
2010-11-25T22:18:00.000Z	BluesKaj	evilbug	usually the BIOS requires f1 or f2 in my experience some also will open with f10
2010-11-25T22:20:00.000Z	evilbug	BluesKaj	f2 worked this time around.
2010-11-25T22:22:00.000Z	evilbug	BluesKaj	i'm in the bios now and things seem to look in order.
2010-11-25T22:23:00.000Z	BluesKaj	evilbug	make sure the cdrom is the first device in the boot order
2010-11-25T22:35:00.000Z	evilbug	BluesKaj	so i've made "cdrom" be the first option but the disc still won't boot.
2010-11-26T23:42:00.000Z	evilbug	BluesKaj	hey. so i managed to get that ubuntu install going yesterday.
2010-11-26T23:45:00.000Z	evilbug	BluesKaj	for some reason it wouldn't read the disc but i found out that my friend didn't create a proper usb stick install and so i guided him through that and worked out.
