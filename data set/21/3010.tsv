2009-06-09T11:44:00.000Z	indus	emacs	i think you should file a bug report but its probably some faulty hardware
2009-06-09T11:45:00.000Z	indus	emacs	some usb headers used to freeze my system so i disconnected them from mobo
2009-06-09T11:49:00.000Z	indus	emacs	it seems like a hardware issue
2009-06-09T11:50:00.000Z	emacs	indus	ok if it is a hardware issue then y its not affecting boss linux...
