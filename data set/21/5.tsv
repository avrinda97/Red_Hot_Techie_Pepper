2004-10-26T09:08:00.000Z	seraph		I have a question
2004-10-26T09:08:00.000Z	seraph		did X break for anyone with the latest update?
2004-10-26T09:08:00.000Z	seraph		say in the past 24 hours or so?
2004-10-26T09:09:00.000Z	seraph		mine is reporting all kinds of gl symbol related errors
2004-10-26T09:09:00.000Z	seraph		even vim isn't working on the command line because of libXt
2004-10-26T09:09:00.000Z	fabbione	seraph	there were no X updates in the last 24 hours
2004-10-26T09:10:00.000Z	seraph	fabbione	nvidia
2004-10-26T09:10:00.000Z	fabbione	seraph	revert to nv and see if the problem persist
2004-10-26T09:10:00.000Z	fabbione	seraph	there is no need to reinstall
2004-10-26T09:10:00.000Z	fabbione	seraph	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86
2004-10-26T09:10:00.000Z	fabbione	seraph	well that's not an X problem ;)
2004-10-26T09:11:00.000Z	seraph	fabbione	actually no, thats just dpkg
2004-10-26T09:13:00.000Z	fabbione	seraph	i get the same but they are harmless
2004-10-26T09:14:00.000Z	fabbione	seraph	something must be seriously broken on your system'
2004-10-26T09:15:00.000Z	fabbione	seraph	probably the database is corrupted
2004-10-26T09:16:00.000Z	fabbione	seraph	probably
2004-10-26T09:20:00.000Z	fabbione	seraph	what happens if you run: dpkg --get-selections * ?
2004-10-26T09:21:00.000Z	seraph	fabbione	segfault
2004-10-26T09:23:00.000Z	fabbione	seraph	i guess you don't have much you can do
2004-10-26T09:25:00.000Z	fabbione	seraph	yes. but i would still run a memtest
2004-10-26T09:27:00.000Z	seraph	fabbione	memtest is clean since < 2 months ago
