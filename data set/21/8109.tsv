2008-01-12T07:11:00.000Z	Pelo	zeemystteryman	you messed up your boot sector wit the new install

2008-01-12T07:11:00.000Z	Pelo	zeemystteryman	what do you have installed on the hdd ?
2008-01-12T07:13:00.000Z	Pelo	zeemystteryman	can you boot from the usb stick ?
2008-01-12T07:15:00.000Z	Pelo	zeemystteryman	ok try this  , boot regularly from the same hdd that was set as boot when you instaled ubuntu on the external hdd, my guess is that grub pahse one is on the internal but set to look for menu.lst on the external
2008-01-12T07:17:00.000Z	Pelo	zeemystteryman	not a qustion of having gusty installed on the internal,  but the bootloader ( grub) default installs on the boot hdd as per the bios settings
2008-01-12T07:18:00.000Z	Pelo	zeemystteryman	if you can boot that way you'll just need to dl the supergrub cd and fix it ,easy enough
2008-01-12T07:20:00.000Z	Pelo	zeemystteryman	it won'T be but check if you can boot from the internal with the external plugged in first, that way we will know if that is the problem I think it is
2008-01-12T07:21:00.000Z	Pelo	zeemystteryman	you uinsalled gusty ?
2008-01-12T07:21:00.000Z	Pelo	zeemystteryman	I think I am a bit confused as to the nature of the problem
2008-01-12T07:21:00.000Z	Pelo	zeemystteryman	 nemver mind then
2008-01-12T07:21:00.000Z	Pelo	zeemystteryman	, check in gparted, figuere out the /dev/hd** of the external hdd
2008-01-12T07:22:00.000Z	Pelo	zeemystteryman	when you get to the last dialog of the installer for ubuntu , where you see (hd0,0) I'll give you the correct  addy to change that to and your will be able to boot gutsy from the external
2008-01-12T07:23:00.000Z	Pelo	zeemystteryman	ok start wit the insatller  when you get to the last screen chanage  (hd0,0) to (hd1,0)
2008-01-12T07:24:00.000Z	Pelo	zeemystteryman	if you don'T need it anymore, I just wanted you to look up the dev of your external hdd
2008-01-12T07:29:00.000Z	Pelo	zeemystteryman	 there is only one  the icon on the destkiop, the important bit you need to remember to get this working problerly is that on the last dialog screen of the installer  you need to chagne hd0,0 to hd1,0
2008-01-12T07:29:00.000Z	Pelo	zeemystteryman	in the summary screen at the very end
