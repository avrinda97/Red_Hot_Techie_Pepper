2006-03-29T10:26:00.000Z	sweven		hi
2006-03-29T10:28:00.000Z	sweven		heheh
2006-03-29T10:29:00.000Z	sweven		Anyone have any last ditch advice for me to salvage this installation operation?
2006-03-29T10:29:00.000Z	sweven		Maybe try to get the Live CD working and poke around?
2006-03-29T10:30:00.000Z	sweven		I've tried to install 4 times, with 2 different CDs and I always get "Operating System not found"
2006-03-29T10:30:00.000Z	ReWT_AxS	sweven	you dual booting?
2006-03-29T10:32:00.000Z	ReWT_AxS	sweven	have you check forums?
2006-03-29T10:34:00.000Z	sweven	ReWT_AxS	yes I searched the forums but I couldn't find anything conclusive
2006-03-29T10:34:00.000Z	ReWT_AxS	sweven	let me have a look, hold on.
2006-03-29T10:35:00.000Z	sweven	ReWT_AxS	I really appreciate it!  Thanks
2006-03-29T10:35:00.000Z	ReWT_AxS	sweven	not a problem.
2006-03-29T10:39:00.000Z	ReWT_AxS	sweven	still here?
2006-03-29T10:39:00.000Z	sweven	ReWT_AxS	yes
2006-03-29T10:40:00.000Z	ReWT_AxS	sweven	use pastebin to paste sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.list
2006-03-29T10:41:00.000Z	sweven	ReWT_AxS	should I do that when I get the Live CD running?
2006-03-29T10:42:00.000Z	ReWT_AxS	sweven	do you have anything else on the hard drive?
2006-03-29T10:42:00.000Z	sweven	ReWT_AxS	No, I wiped the whole thing and now it's just the main partition and the swap
2006-03-29T10:44:00.000Z	ReWT_AxS	sweven	Get on the live, run qtparted and make sure you have the right partition setup.
2006-03-29T10:44:00.000Z	sweven	ReWT_AxS	Okay, I'll check it out, brb
