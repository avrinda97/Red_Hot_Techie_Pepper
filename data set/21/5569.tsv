2007-09-27T13:56:00.000Z	Alex_Gaynor		I just set up a samba file share on my home directory however when i try to connect from windows it doesn't accept my password and it tries to put a domain in front of the username, what should that domain be(or did I screw something up)
2007-09-27T13:56:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Alex_Gaynor	sudo smbpasswd -a username
2007-09-27T13:57:00.000Z	Alex_Gaynor	MasterShrek	I did that
2007-09-27T14:00:00.000Z	Alex_Gaynor	MasterShrek	I can see the machine in my workgroup, but I can't seem to authenticate
2007-09-27T14:00:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Alex_Gaynor	did you create a samba password for your user?
2007-09-27T14:01:00.000Z	Alex_Gaynor	MasterShrek	Yep
2007-09-27T14:03:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Alex_Gaynor	webserv is the hostname?
2007-09-27T14:03:00.000Z	Alex_Gaynor	MasterShrek	yeah
2007-09-27T14:04:00.000Z	Alex_Gaynor	MasterShrek	Nope :(
2007-09-27T14:08:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Alex_Gaynor	check your /etc/samba/smb.conf, check to see if theres a line that says: security = user, change it to security = share
2007-09-27T14:10:00.000Z	Alex_Gaynor	MasterShrek	Done, I can now connect to \\webserv but there aren't any files in there
2007-09-27T14:10:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Alex_Gaynor	did u make a change in smb.conf? if u did you have to: sudo /etc/init.d/samba restart
2007-09-27T14:10:00.000Z	Alex_Gaynor	MasterShrek	Yeah, I did both before I tried to connect
2007-09-27T14:11:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Alex_Gaynor	check the share definition in smb.conf and make sure it has the option available = yes
2007-09-27T14:12:00.000Z	Alex_Gaynor	MasterShrek	I don't have an available option in here anywhere
2007-09-27T14:13:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Alex_Gaynor	type it in there
2007-09-27T14:15:00.000Z	Alex_Gaynor	MasterShrek	Nothing
2007-09-27T14:19:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Alex_Gaynor	put guestok = yes under that share definition
2007-09-27T14:23:00.000Z	Alex_Gaynor	MasterShrek	Nope
2007-09-27T14:39:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Alex_Gaynor	are the server and client in the same workgroup?
