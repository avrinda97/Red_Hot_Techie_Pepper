2010-09-01T04:57:00.000Z	DasEi	newfedoranoob	(please put my Nick when answering) , thats the internal on a lappi you use there ?

2010-09-01T05:01:00.000Z	newfedoranoob	DasEi	 umm im on fedora rite now cause i cant read anything on ubuntu
2010-09-01T05:02:00.000Z	DasEi		newfedoranoob:I see, will problaby be nouveau-firmware that collides there, but would be good to know which nvidia packages are installed, once the obsolete one are removed, run sudo nvidia-xconfig and restart xserver
2010-09-01T05:02:00.000Z	newfedoranoob		ok
2010-09-01T05:03:00.000Z	DasEi	newfedoranoob	you can do this from terminal, too, so don't need x for it
2010-09-01T05:03:00.000Z	newfedoranoob	DasEi	thx i will try when i boot ubuntu
2010-09-01T05:04:00.000Z	DasEi	newfedoranoob	dpkg -l | grep nvidia shows you the nv-packets, ii means installed on that output
