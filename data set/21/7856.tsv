2006-07-02T15:50:00.000Z	kimo_^_		guys, I want to turn an old box, into (traffic manager, Firewall, Proxy, IDS ) appliance, for some friend Windows admins. Any recommended projects that do this kinda things ?
2006-07-02T06:38:00.000Z	kimo_^_		Hi, is it possible to install and use two DIFFERENT java versions on one Linux machine. And point applications to different versions. Please let me know asap ....
2006-07-02T06:38:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	kimo_^_	yes and yes
2006-07-02T06:38:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	kimo_^_	depends on which java kinds you're thinking
2006-07-02T06:38:00.000Z	kimo_^_	pppoe_dude	thnx a lot .... what do u mean ?
2006-07-02T06:39:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	kimo_^_	and depends on how clean you want them to be. like, it is not a good idea to install two different Sun java's
2006-07-02T06:39:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	kimo_^_	+ not possible with apt-get.. only binaries
2006-07-02T06:39:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	kimo_^_	but you can have gnu java and sun java installed and use both
2006-07-02T06:39:00.000Z	kimo_^_	pppoe_dude	I have no problem installing from non debs ... (from Sun downloads)
2006-07-02T06:40:00.000Z	kimo_^_	pppoe_dude	basically how do I point apps to a certain version ?
2006-07-02T06:40:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	kimo_^_	well... way i would do it is just issue a '/path/to/java -jar <app name>'
2006-07-02T06:40:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	kimo_^_	or write a small shell script that does that
2006-07-02T06:41:00.000Z	kimo_^_	pppoe_dude	what if the application uses java libs ..
2006-07-02T06:41:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	kimo_^_	shouldnt be an issue....
2006-07-02T06:41:00.000Z	kimo_^_	pppoe_dude	how will it be handled ?
2006-07-02T06:42:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	kimo_^_	are you running jar fiels?
2006-07-02T06:42:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	kimo_^_	the java binary iirc will handle the paths to the libs
2006-07-02T06:42:00.000Z	kimo_^_	pppoe_dude	no, I'm running large applications like oracle
2006-07-02T06:43:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	kimo_^_	this is as much as i know... you can try and see if it works
2006-07-02T06:43:00.000Z	kimo_^_	pppoe_dude	ok thanks a lot :)
2006-07-02T06:43:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	kimo_^_	you can also try #java
