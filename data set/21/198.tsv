2012-06-09T22:43:00.000Z	funto_	escott	in case you're still here: my /etc/fstab is here: http://pastebin.com/zRtqqwjw
2012-06-09T22:44:00.000Z	escott	funto_	when you get the other stuff i can compare
2012-06-09T22:44:00.000Z	funto_		parted -l here: http://pastebin.com/GME07w5C
2012-06-09T22:45:00.000Z	funto_		blkid: http://pastebin.com/Dk1TnZKA
2012-06-09T22:45:00.000Z	funto_	escott	and I have nothing for the GRUB files you mentionned as I still use GRUB 1
2012-06-09T22:46:00.000Z	escott	funto_	then menu.lst
2012-06-09T22:46:00.000Z	funto_	escott	1 minute :)
2012-06-09T22:49:00.000Z	escott	funto_	blkid, fstab, and parted all look good. so the problem is either in menu.lst or something about the new kernel that is causing a race condition in bringing up sda. for someone like yourself still using grub1 i recommend doing the conversion to grub2. you are increasingly in the minority, and im not sure what the proper incantation is to make grub1 do a root-delay, but i do with grub2
2012-06-09T22:49:00.000Z	funto_	escott	menu.lst is here: http://pastebin.com/vxFRj18B
2012-06-09T22:50:00.000Z	escott	funto_	i thought you said this happened after an upgrade of some form?
2012-06-09T22:50:00.000Z	funto_		hmm...ok but I admit upgrading grub makes me worried, I think I need to do some backups first then ^^
2012-06-09T22:50:00.000Z	funto_	escott	yes, I just upgraded from one LTS version to the next
2012-06-09T22:50:00.000Z	funto_		10.04 to 12.04
2012-06-09T22:51:00.000Z	funto_		upgrade-manager -d or something like that ^^
2012-06-09T22:51:00.000Z	escott	funto_	your menu.lst does not reflect that
2012-06-09T22:51:00.000Z	funto_		ah?
2012-06-09T22:51:00.000Z	escott	funto_	it only shows the 10.04 kernels. i suspect you need to do the conversion to grub2
2012-06-09T22:52:00.000Z	funto_	escott	menu.lst refers to Ubuntu 10.04 but I think that's just the displayed label
2012-06-09T22:53:00.000Z	funto_		the kernel version number corresponds to the one uname -a returns
2012-06-09T22:53:00.000Z	funto_		namely, 2.6.32-34
2012-06-09T22:53:00.000Z	escott	funto_	no its booting a 2.6 kernel. we are up to 3.2 now
