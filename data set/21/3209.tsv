2009-09-25T09:41:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	user01	Avant? AWN for short?
2009-10-24T06:33:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	user01	ls -1 > list.txt
2009-10-24T06:33:00.000Z	user01	ZykoticK9	it would go into one line?
2009-10-24T06:33:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	user01	no that's one line per file
2009-10-24T06:34:00.000Z	user01	ZykoticK9	yes i wanted all file names on one line separated by a space
2009-10-24T06:34:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	user01	don't know how to do that one, best of luck
2009-10-24T06:34:00.000Z	user01	ZykoticK9	ill keep looking thanks!
2009-12-20T06:13:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	user01	it can
2009-12-20T06:14:00.000Z	user01	ZykoticK9	but not by default?
2009-12-20T06:14:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	user01	not by default -- there is persistance setting at the bottom (reserved space)
2009-12-20T06:15:00.000Z	user01	ZykoticK9	how would that work then if i install a video driver for one computer then take it to another computer?  It would automatically load the correct one?
2009-12-20T06:15:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	user01	i'm not too sure how video driver play with USB persistence?  I've never tried it.  Good luck.
2009-12-20T06:17:00.000Z	user01	ZykoticK9	is ext4 journaling?  like it would be bad to use it for USB like ext3?
2009-12-20T06:18:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	user01	ext4 is journaled yes -- so it ext3 though
2009-12-20T06:19:00.000Z	user01	ZykoticK9	i was thinking of creating a persistent USB that i could just plug into my computer at work then i could just run in virtualbox anything windows required by the company :)
2009-12-20T06:20:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	user01	USB + Virtualbox might not give you the performance you need (USB is kinda slow).  Good luck man.
2009-12-20T06:20:00.000Z	user01	ZykoticK9	oh :(
2009-12-20T06:21:00.000Z	user01	ZykoticK9	well, it would only be for there spying software so i dont care if that is slow
2010-08-22T05:19:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	user01	you technically cannot make an ISO out of an audio cd - you can create a disk image, just not an ISO
2010-08-22T05:19:00.000Z	user01	ZykoticK9	well it wasnt making anything
