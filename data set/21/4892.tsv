2008-04-25T03:29:00.000Z	RyanPrior	histo	Flash has been working in Hardy for me for months.
2008-04-25T03:29:00.000Z	RyanPrior	histo	There may be problems, but hopefully it's something that can be fixed.
2008-08-22T07:22:00.000Z	histo	RyanPrior	but its a link to /var/www
2008-08-22T07:23:00.000Z	RyanPrior	histo	That sounds silly.
2008-08-22T07:23:00.000Z	histo	RyanPrior	why.
2008-08-22T07:24:00.000Z	RyanPrior	histo	Why do you link /home/user/www to /var/www?
2008-08-22T07:24:00.000Z	histo	RyanPrior	because he wants to do that.
2008-10-04T06:00:00.000Z	histo	RyanPrior	you can try hitting ctrl+c or ctrl+x
2008-10-04T06:01:00.000Z	histo	RyanPrior	if not you can open another terminal and kill the pid
2008-10-04T06:01:00.000Z	RyanPrior	histo	Certianly those are options, but I'm not sure it's safe to kill a program which is in the middle of removing a kernel module.
2008-11-03T11:06:00.000Z	RyanPrior	histo	That's a recipe for disaster.
2008-11-03T11:06:00.000Z	histo	RyanPrior	whys that? thats what he wanted to do.
2008-11-03T11:06:00.000Z	histo	RyanPrior	its no differen then using the term
2008-11-03T11:06:00.000Z	RyanPrior	histo	What could he possibly want to do with a root nautilus session.
2008-11-03T11:07:00.000Z	RyanPrior	histo	Nautilus makes stuff easy to move around, delete, etc - the terminal makes you spell it all out.
2008-11-03T11:07:00.000Z	histo	RyanPrior	edit a file possibly in /etc/ who knows its his system thats what they want to do.
2008-11-03T11:07:00.000Z	RyanPrior	histo	He should maybe launch an editor as root, but not nautilus for pete's sake.
