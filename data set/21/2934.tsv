2009-05-12T02:41:00.000Z	olentolupa		Also I would like to backup the files on my previous ubuntu install partition before I go on but when booting from the desktop cd and trying to copy from the hard drive, it says no permission
2009-05-12T02:41:00.000Z	olentolupa		how will I get permission for the hd when booting from the cd
2009-05-12T02:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	olentolupa	live cd is using a differnt user. easy way it to just use sudo/gksu and  copy the stuff as root user.
2009-05-12T03:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	olentolupa	 souns like a messed up menu.lst to me.
2009-05-12T02:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	olentolupa	 the root user has full access to all the filessytems
2009-05-12T02:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	olentolupa	 your phrase 'root for the cd' means nothing.
2009-05-12T02:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	olentolupa	 boot live cd. run file manager as root ,. mount the drives.. do what you want..
2009-05-12T02:49:00.000Z	olentolupa	Dr_Willis	so "sudo nautilus"?
2009-05-12T02:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	olentolupa	 gksu normally.. if you want to use that file manager.
2009-05-12T02:52:00.000Z	olentolupa	Dr_Willis	ok, I got it to work - how come it didn't ask for any password? i had always thought that all the data on my ext3 partition was password protected?
2009-05-12T02:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	olentolupa	 no its not.
2009-05-12T02:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	olentolupa	 if you ha encrypted the filesytem then it would be
2009-05-12T02:54:00.000Z	olentolupa	Dr_Willis	do you have some idea how i would rewrite the grub? I've tried the directions from the ubuntuwiki but somehow the menu.lst just won't show up after the grub-install command
2009-05-12T02:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	olentolupa	 grub is the kind of tool it pays to read/learn its docs. at the grub homepage for sttarters. ive  played with grub so muich over theyears its not too hard. once you  learn what you are doing
2009-05-12T02:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	olentolupa	 if you say /boot/grub has no files - ots proberly befause you are lookin gat the cd's / (root) not the root of the hard drive.
2009-05-12T02:58:00.000Z	olentolupa	Dr_Willis	i've re-checked - it is the directory on the hd. also, after attempting to reinstall grub, it says while booting from the hd, something like "need to load kernel first"
2009-05-12T03:00:00.000Z	olentolupa	Dr_Willis	there's not menu.lst in the grub directory at all.
2009-05-12T03:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	olentolupa	 that sounds like a issue to me then.
2009-05-12T03:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	olentolupa	 heres my menu.lst for an example http://pastebin.com/fff9fea8
2009-05-12T03:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	olentolupa	 i dont think it does.. i recall the os Installer makes one.. but i dont recall any command that generated one
2009-05-12T03:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	olentolupa	 if you want toboot . you basiciallyneed to make one. by hand if needed
