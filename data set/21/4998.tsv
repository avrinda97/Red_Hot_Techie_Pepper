2008-05-03T22:59:00.000Z	atlanix-org		hello everyone.  I needed to ask a quick question because i'm looking into getting a new PC.  I'm going AMD, should I go with ATI or nVidia for the Video.  I know nVidia has closed source drivers and ATI has open source.
2008-05-03T22:59:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	atlanix-org	do you want to play games?
2008-05-03T23:00:00.000Z	atlanix-org	Ice_Wewe	sure, right now they are a little choppy on my current system with nVidia and Intel proc
2008-05-03T23:00:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	atlanix-org	NVidia
2008-05-03T23:01:00.000Z	atlanix-org	Ice_Wewe	so the surrpot for ATI is not there yet.. hmmm
2008-05-03T23:01:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	atlanix-org	not yet
2008-05-03T23:01:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	atlanix-org	their chipset support also leaves you wanting, unfortunately
2008-05-03T23:02:00.000Z	atlanix-org	Ice_Wewe	would you go 790FX north bridge or an nVidia SLi north bridge?
2008-05-03T23:02:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	atlanix-org	sorry, I don't know. I'm still on NF4, I don't have enough money to get a new system so I've been lagging behind somewhat
2008-05-03T23:02:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	atlanix-org	are you going to use SLi?
2008-05-03T23:03:00.000Z	atlanix-org	Ice_Wewe	nothing.  I don't have the money to do a dual video card setup
2008-05-03T23:03:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	atlanix-org	so you're only interested in SLi as a possible upgrade option?
2008-05-03T23:03:00.000Z	atlanix-org	Ice_Wewe	didn't know if you hand knowledge of north bridges.. the 790FX is AMD top northbridge right now
2008-05-03T23:04:00.000Z	atlanix-org	Ice_Wewe	yes and the 790FX will support SLi as well
2008-05-03T23:04:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	atlanix-org	ah, right, forgot...
2008-05-03T23:04:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	atlanix-org	no, the 790X supports CrossFireX, which is the ATi equiv.
2008-05-03T23:04:00.000Z	atlanix-org	Ice_Wewe	I'm just trying to get the most support for Ubuntu
2008-05-03T23:04:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	atlanix-org	I would go for NVidia or Intel chipset, personally
2008-05-03T23:05:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	atlanix-org	yes, the 790FX _IS_ the best chipset, but the drivers are lacking
2008-05-03T23:05:00.000Z	atlanix-org	Ice_Wewe	thx.  I will stick with what i selected first. AMD and nVidia.  Same setup I had about 5 years ago.  Thx Ice_Wewe
2008-05-03T23:06:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	atlanix-org	glad to help!
