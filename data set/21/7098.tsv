2010-04-13T03:12:00.000Z	framework		can anyone adive on sharing with samba between ubuntu hardi 8.04 & windows XP
2010-04-13T03:13:00.000Z	framework		need help with pinging ubuntu from windows machine Destinations Host Unreachable
2010-04-13T03:14:00.000Z	genii	framework	Check gateway and/or netmask
2010-04-13T03:15:00.000Z	genii	framework	Please do not private-message me. I assist only in the public channel
2010-04-13T03:16:00.000Z	genii	framework	Again- Please do not private-message me. I assist only in the public channel
2010-04-13T03:16:00.000Z	framework		#genni sorry
2010-04-13T03:16:00.000Z	framework	linux	pinging windows but not the other side aroung
2010-04-13T03:17:00.000Z	framework		subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 where is the gateway defined on linux?
2010-04-13T03:18:00.000Z	genii	framework	The netmask determines usually your gateway, etc. So 255.255.255.0  usually means that x.x.x.1 is the gateway. (x.x.x.1 is usually something like 192.168.0.1) try to ping the gateway from each box
2010-04-13T03:19:00.000Z	framework		both pinging
2010-04-13T03:19:00.000Z	framework		my gateway (router) ip is: 10.0.0.138
2010-04-13T03:20:00.000Z	genii	framework	A mask of 255.255.255.0 does not put the gateway usually at x.x.x.138
2010-04-13T03:21:00.000Z	framework		so, do you have any idea for me how to menipulate this to be able to ping from windows to linux?
2010-04-13T03:25:00.000Z	framework		#genii windows machine has the same subnet like linux
2010-04-13T03:25:00.000Z	genii	framework	I suspect the problem is in how the IP and gateway etc are being determined. If the router is giving the IP by dhcp then it is misconfigured for the mask and gateway it passes onto the clients
2010-04-13T03:25:00.000Z	framework		so do you recomment user static ip maybe?
2010-04-13T03:27:00.000Z	genii	framework	Setting static IP is more problemmatic than just making sure the machines are getting right gateway IP so they can ping each other. Are you pinging by IP or by their names?
2010-04-13T03:28:00.000Z	framework		I'm pinging with the ip address, BTW - what is Bcast? it's configured to be 10.0.0.255 maybe it has something with this issue??
2010-04-13T03:28:00.000Z	genii	framework	Broadcast is where the machines announce they exist
2010-04-13T03:29:00.000Z	framework		so maybe define it to be 10.0.0.5 will help me ping from the windows machine?
2010-04-13T03:29:00.000Z	genii	framework	Some work requires me
