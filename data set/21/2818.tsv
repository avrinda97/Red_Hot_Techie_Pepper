2010-01-08T02:24:00.000Z	scott_ino2		Can anyone help me in mounting an ext3 network share?
2010-01-08T02:24:00.000Z	scott_ino2		I can ssh into it, but would like it to be locally mounted
2010-01-08T02:25:00.000Z	scott_ino2		formated as ext3
2010-01-08T02:26:00.000Z	scott_ino2		everyone else can see it as a network share... "network" in ubuntu doesn't seem to pick it up, but like I said I can ssh into it just fine
2010-01-08T02:26:00.000Z	scott_ino2		basically i don't want my transfers going over the net, since it's local network, ssh doesn't make sense
2010-01-08T02:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	scott_ino2	 you mean its a SAMBA share? or a NFS share?
2010-01-08T02:27:00.000Z	scott_ino2	Dr_Willis	yes
2010-01-08T02:28:00.000Z	scott_ino2	Dr_Willis	according to what im reading it should be viewable as a samba/nfs share, but im wondering the "How" part of that. Like I said windows/mac sees it as a SMB share
2010-01-08T02:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	scott_ino2	 the users samba password can be different from their login drivers, 'sudo smbpasswd -a USERNAME' to set a samba password
2010-01-08T02:37:00.000Z	scott_ino2	Dr_Willis	i got it ;) im in
2010-01-08T02:37:00.000Z	scott_ino2	Dr_Willis	wondering if this will now work locally and not have to traverse the interwebs like it was doing when uploading files via ssh
2010-01-08T02:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	scott_ino2	 thers cases where you may be better off with nfs or sshfs over samba
2010-01-08T02:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	scott_ino2	 ssh to the ip should be direct as samba is.
2010-01-08T02:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	scott_ino2	 sshfs may be slower at transfers.. nfs will poberly be faster then samba
2010-01-08T02:38:00.000Z	scott_ino2	Dr_Willis	sigh... upload was 225k... im dealing with HUGE files here.
2010-01-08T02:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	scott_ino2	 nfs may be worth doing then.
2010-01-08T02:39:00.000Z	scott_ino2	Dr_Willis	I'm not sure that's an option with my hardware
2010-01-08T02:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	scott_ino2	 what does nfs have to do with hardware? If ya got a linux  box  it can do nfs. :)
2010-01-08T02:41:00.000Z	scott_ino2	Dr_Willis	this is a droboshare.. proprietary hardware
2010-01-08T02:48:00.000Z	scott_ino2	Dr_Willis	upload is much better with smb :) im on wireless and getting about 350kb/s
2010-01-08T02:49:00.000Z	scott_ino2	Dr_Willis	so im guessing if i plug in i'll be good
