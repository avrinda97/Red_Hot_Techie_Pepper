2008-06-07T06:53:00.000Z	cowbud		where's my BOOZE
2008-06-07T06:55:00.000Z	Bodsda	cowbud	this is a support channel if you dont need support or your not going to helpothers please be quiet or leave
2008-06-07T06:56:00.000Z	cowbud	Bodsda	noticeI am helping someone
2008-06-07T06:57:00.000Z	Bodsda	cowbud	then please stop the unnecessary posts
2008-06-07T06:57:00.000Z	cowbud	Bodsda	unnecessary it is a chat channel who is the overlord that deems things unneccsary
2008-06-07T06:59:00.000Z	Bodsda	cowbud	if you would like to continue this discussion then let me no and we'll move to #ubuntu-ops -- nad perhaps you should consider reading the !coc
2008-06-07T06:59:00.000Z	cowbud	Bodsda	did you mean know or no?
2008-06-07T06:59:00.000Z	Bodsda	cowbud	know
2008-06-07T07:07:00.000Z	Bodsda	cowbud	floodbot only tells the offender of the flood it doesnt 'continue the flood' thats like saying the next person who posts is flooding
2008-06-07T07:08:00.000Z	cowbud	Bodsda	yeah well maybe floodbot should msg them instead of do it publically so we all don't have to see yet another useless line of text in this channel
2008-06-07T07:08:00.000Z	Bodsda	cowbud	some people dont allow pm's
2008-06-07T07:09:00.000Z	cowbud	Bodsda	seems like a bum compromise
2008-06-07T07:09:00.000Z	Bodsda	cowbud	what does?
2008-06-07T07:09:00.000Z	cowbud	Bodsda	subjecting everyone to that because some people don't accept msgs they should just get kicked then
2008-06-07T07:10:00.000Z	Bodsda	cowbud	that would be harsh on users who have never been on irc before, they dont know not to post 4 lines in quick succession
2008-06-07T07:20:00.000Z	Bodsda	cowbud	someone asks a question you say go away and search yourself -- not the helping mentality were trying to show
2008-06-07T07:21:00.000Z	Bodsda	cowbud	no but give me 10 mins i can prob find out
2008-06-07T07:21:00.000Z	Bodsda	cowbud	this is a channel welcometo n00bs intermidiates and pros alike
