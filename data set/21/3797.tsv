2008-09-24T09:20:00.000Z	annie_g		Hi - Running a Nvidia Geforce 7300gs PCI Express - video was great yesterday - now is set to 800x600 - not sure what happened - any idea's on a fix?
2008-09-24T09:21:00.000Z	annie_g		Tried changing display but will not go any higher then 800x600....
2008-09-24T09:22:00.000Z	brandonmpace	annie_g	have you installed the driver for your video card?
2008-09-24T09:26:00.000Z	brandonmpace	annie_g	have you tried envy-ng?
2008-09-24T09:27:00.000Z	annie_g	brandonmpace	no - run in a terminal command?
2008-09-24T09:29:00.000Z	annie_g	brandonmpace	sorry - what do you mean by " !envy " - ?
2008-09-24T09:31:00.000Z	annie_g	brandonmpace	use that as a search term in synapics?
2008-09-24T09:31:00.000Z	brandonmpace	annie_g	could be, I would try reading what ubottu says. ! is the way to invoke the bot.              on the terminal> sudo apt-get install envyng-gtk
2008-09-24T09:36:00.000Z	annie_g	brandonmpace	I did the terminal install of the command you gave - hopefully after reboot I will have decent video - correct?
2008-09-24T09:36:00.000Z	brandonmpace	annie_g	you have to find envyng in the menus
2008-09-24T09:36:00.000Z	brandonmpace	annie_g	and open it
2008-09-24T09:37:00.000Z	annie_g	brandonmpace	ah yes - it's under Apps/System tools
2008-09-24T09:39:00.000Z	annie_g	brandonmpace	Best to go with the "Automatic Hardware Selection" ?
2008-09-24T09:39:00.000Z	brandonmpace	annie_g	I would, unless you know better
2008-09-24T09:42:00.000Z	brandonmpace	annie_g	you´re welcome, I hope that fixes it :)
2008-09-24T10:10:00.000Z	annie_g	brandonmpace	Hi - after running the EnvyNG took (2) steps backwords - after restart - display went to 640x480 x 50hz - had to restart in safemode just to get back to 800x600 - 60hz - I also have slide-in hard drive trays (1) with Ubuntu and another (1) with Windows - Started the windows hard drive and all the hardware checks out ok - display is very high and hasn't changed - also viewsonic VA930 flat panel is just fine - any other idea's ? ?
2008-09-24T10:12:00.000Z	brandonmpace	annie_g	if it worked before I would try a reinstall
2008-09-24T10:16:00.000Z	annie_g	brandonmpace	That's a little drastic - I have a bunch of files to backup - at least 300gb's - but was thinking about it the other day anyway ? This just forces me to backup and start afresh !
2008-09-24T10:17:00.000Z	brandonmpace	annie_g	wow that´s a lot! that will work though
2008-09-24T10:18:00.000Z	annie_g	brandonmpace	yea been putting "Deluge" through the paces - If ya know what I mean......
2008-09-24T10:19:00.000Z	annie_g	brandonmpace	Have so much unneeded junk installed on here anyway - so in long run will be good thing to ..... Thanks for input - appreciate it.
