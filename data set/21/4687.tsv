2008-02-29T22:22:00.000Z	Valas		hi people. can anyone help me with TV-out?
2008-02-29T22:24:00.000Z	Valas		I have nvidia. i'm using nvidia settings. and can only see black and white.
2008-02-29T22:25:00.000Z	Valas		TV-OUT - what could be the reason for seeing only Black&white in TV?
2008-02-29T22:27:00.000Z	frank232	Valas	does you video card support component video output?
2008-02-29T22:27:00.000Z	Valas		what is component video output? I have NVIDIA 8400. it's very strong card
2008-02-29T22:28:00.000Z	Valas	frank232	what is component video output? I have NVIDIA 8400. it's very strong card
2008-02-29T22:29:00.000Z	frank232	Valas	component output is an analog HD type of connection (with 3 cables).
2008-02-29T22:29:00.000Z	Valas	frank232	oh. I have it, but don't have the cable. so i'm using the s-video.
2008-02-29T22:30:00.000Z	frank232	Valas	ok. I was just thinking maybe the video card thinks it's connected with component
2008-02-29T22:31:00.000Z	Valas	frank232	how can i be sure? BTW, maybe it using NTSC and i need pal?
2008-02-29T22:32:00.000Z	frank232	Valas	not sure about that. if you connect Pal to NTSC, I think you get a lot of flickering in the image too
2008-02-29T22:33:00.000Z	Valas	frank232	 no flickering here. so probably it's not it.
2008-02-29T22:35:00.000Z	frank232	Valas	on the back of the card is there only one port for component/composite/s-video ?
2008-02-29T22:35:00.000Z	Valas	frank232	exactly - one for each.
2008-02-29T22:36:00.000Z	frank232	Valas	yeah it probably thinks it's in cmponent but I am not sure how to set it for s-video
2008-02-29T22:37:00.000Z	Valas	frank232	oh. thanks. so I need to change xorg.conf ?
2008-02-29T22:37:00.000Z	Valas	frank232	and tell it to use s-video
2008-02-29T22:37:00.000Z	frank232	Valas	yeah I gues...
2008-02-29T22:38:00.000Z	Valas	frank232	thanks. i shell look for it in google
2008-02-29T22:39:00.000Z	frank232	Valas	it could also be a NTSC to PAL problem
