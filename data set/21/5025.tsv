2008-01-20T03:19:00.000Z	Davey		I'm having issues with my USB drive, it has three partitions all formatted as HSF+, `mount` gives me, /dev/sde12 on /media/Akeru type hfsplus (rw,nosuid,nodev,uid=1000,gid=1000) but when I try to make changes (i.e. create a directory) and it says: mkdir: cannot create directory `sekhmet': Read-only file system
2008-01-20T03:20:00.000Z	Duke_Fluke	Davey	have you tried remounting it read/write?
2008-01-20T03:21:00.000Z	Davey	Duke_Fluke	from the mount output, it looks like it *is* read/write, if not, how do I do that?
2008-01-20T03:23:00.000Z	Davey	Duke_Fluke	it looks like, *maybe* mount -o remount rw /media/Akeru would do it?
2008-01-20T03:23:00.000Z	Duke_Fluke	Davey	I understand but I meant doing it manually, first try umounting it with umount /dev/sde12 the manually remount it with....yeah thats it :)
2008-01-20T03:24:00.000Z	Davey	Duke_Fluke	still says it's read-only :/
2008-01-20T03:24:00.000Z	Duke_Fluke	Davey	 what was the filesystem again HFS?
2008-01-20T03:25:00.000Z	Davey	Duke_Fluke	HSF+
2008-01-20T03:26:00.000Z	Davey	Duke_Fluke	gonna reboot, see if it brings up the drive in r/w
2008-01-20T03:26:00.000Z	Duke_Fluke	Davey	 good luck :)
2008-01-20T03:27:00.000Z	Davey	Duke_Fluke	I'm just hoping it comes back up, I'm trying to backup my RAID which has issues :/
2008-01-20T03:28:00.000Z	Duke_Fluke	Davey	yikes have you thought about copying to the hfs drive over the network?

2008-01-20T03:28:00.000Z	Duke_Fluke	Davey	 is it an external or internal drive?
