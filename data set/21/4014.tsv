2011-03-07T23:18:00.000Z	Nillerz		I use Windows sometimes just for video games, and even though I never use a web browser, the os seems to corrupt and break itself down over time.
2011-03-07T23:19:00.000Z	Nillerz		?
2011-03-07T23:19:00.000Z	Nillerz		ah, must have missed whatever you were talking about, just joined the channel
2011-03-07T23:21:00.000Z	Nillerz		Mac OS X is great for catholics.
2011-03-07T23:21:00.000Z	Nillerz		As long as you listen to Apple and do what Apple says, you're computer will work fine

2011-03-07T23:23:00.000Z	ikonia	Nillerz	I know how it works, thanks
2011-03-07T23:26:00.000Z	ikonia	Nillerz	just ignore it
2011-03-07T23:26:00.000Z	ikonia	Nillerz	please stop feeding it
2012-07-06T15:30:00.000Z	ikonia	Nillerz	that kernel hasn't been released for ubuntu
2012-07-06T15:30:00.000Z	Nillerz	ikonia	yeah I know, but is there a way to make my broadcom chipset work anyway?
2012-07-06T15:30:00.000Z	ikonia	Nillerz	you've just broke compatability, and using an unsupported kernel, you should have an idea of how to get these things workiung
2012-07-06T15:30:00.000Z	ikonia	Nillerz	why did you update the kernel ?
2012-07-06T15:31:00.000Z	ikonia	Nillerz	why did you think updating the kernel to an unsupported kernel would fix these random issues
2012-07-06T15:31:00.000Z	ikonia	Nillerz	what made you think they are kernel related problems
2012-07-06T15:33:00.000Z	ikonia	Nillerz	yes, 3.3.6 was the fix he suggested
2012-07-06T15:33:00.000Z	ikonia	Nillerz	you appear to have used a totally different and random kernel branch
2012-07-06T15:33:00.000Z	ikonia	Nillerz	and looking at that bug report, it's random people offering random advice, some usint nvidia, some using intel etc, there doesn't appear to be much logic behind it from what I'm reading
2012-07-06T15:35:00.000Z	ikonia	Nillerz	yes, and he suggested a tottally different kernel than the one you've used
2012-07-06T16:07:00.000Z	Nillerz	ikonia	I just installed kernel 3.3.6, restarted into that kernel. I had the same exact problem I had in 3.4.4 in the exact same way
2012-07-06T16:08:00.000Z	ikonia	Nillerz	again, that's not an official kernel
