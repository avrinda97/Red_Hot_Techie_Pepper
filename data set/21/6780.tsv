2007-01-31T13:33:00.000Z	Xif		Is there a shortcut to uninstall all the games that are installed by default on Dapper?
2007-01-31T13:34:00.000Z	ardchoille42	Xif	I doubt that
2007-01-31T14:15:00.000Z	ardchoille42	Xif	Maybe changing the Icon="blah" line in /usr/share/applications Gvim7 ?
2007-01-31T14:24:00.000Z	Xif	ardchoille42	btw, I checked what you asked, and it's ok. (the Icon in gvim.desktop is set correctly)
2007-02-01T16:36:00.000Z	ardchoille42	Xif	You got a weird keyboard or something?
2007-02-01T16:39:00.000Z	ardchoille42	Xif	I would first try reconfiguring xorg with the proper keyboard specs.
2007-02-01T16:40:00.000Z	ardchoille42	Xif	Does this problem happen on any keyboard? or just that one?
2007-02-01T16:41:00.000Z	ardchoille42	Xif	What did you do just before this problem starting ocurring?
2007-02-01T16:42:00.000Z	Xif	ardchoille42	played around with gconftool-2
2007-02-01T16:42:00.000Z	Xif	ardchoille42	disabled some KB shortcuts.
2007-02-01T16:42:00.000Z	ardchoille42	Xif	And what were you chaning in gconf?
2007-02-01T16:42:00.000Z	ardchoille42	Xif	Can you return those to what they were?
2007-02-01T16:43:00.000Z	Xif	ardchoille42	I'm not sure how. Basically, Alt-Shift stopped working
2007-02-01T16:43:00.000Z	ardchoille42	Xif	Sounds like you disabled it in gconf
2007-02-01T16:44:00.000Z	Xif	ardchoille42	might have, any idea how to reinstitute it?
2007-02-01T16:44:00.000Z	ardchoille42	Xif	Did you do this via a terminal?
2007-02-01T16:44:00.000Z	Xif	ardchoille42	yes
2007-02-01T16:44:00.000Z	ardchoille42	Xif	open a terminal and run the 'history' command to see what you did, then you can reverse it.
2007-02-01T16:45:00.000Z	Xif	ardchoille42	thanks, I'll try this next.
2007-02-01T16:56:00.000Z	ardchoille42	Xif	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
2007-02-01T16:57:00.000Z	Xif	ardchoille42	thanks
