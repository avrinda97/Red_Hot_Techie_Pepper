2008-10-18T11:14:00.000Z	zigzags		omg ubuntu is teh fail
2008-10-18T11:15:00.000Z	zigzags		what is the command to restart a process
2008-10-18T11:15:00.000Z	jamesish	zigzags	what process?
2008-10-18T11:16:00.000Z	jamesish	zigzags	by which I mean, is it a daemon or something you started? Generally there's a kill signal for restarting most processes, but daemons have init scripts.
2008-10-18T11:17:00.000Z	jamesish	zigzags	No sound from audio that used to work means something is probably muted :P Did you check the output of alsamzer?
2008-10-18T11:18:00.000Z	jamesish	zigzags	alsamixer, sorry
2008-10-18T11:19:00.000Z	jamesish	zigzags	this isn't gonna be alsa, so it makes no odds. You've verified that the files you're trying to play are okay otherwise?
2008-10-18T11:21:00.000Z	jamesish	zigzags	It's great that they've all worked before, but have you verified them since these issues started?
2008-10-18T11:21:00.000Z	jamesish	zigzags	What kind of files are they?
2008-10-18T11:22:00.000Z	jamesish	zigzags	did they work okay in ubuntu or in a different OS?
2008-10-18T11:23:00.000Z	jamesish	zigzags	you have a copy of mplayer?
2008-10-18T11:26:00.000Z	jamesish	zigzags	it's normal.
2008-10-18T11:27:00.000Z	jamesish	zigzags	might want to tail your logs and see if there's any interesting output.
