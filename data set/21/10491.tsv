2005-02-18T12:09:00.000Z	zerotime		something similar to k3b?
2005-02-18T12:09:00.000Z	zerotime		cause if I install k3b, it will install most kde
2005-02-18T12:10:00.000Z	zerotime		I hardly use kde
2005-02-18T12:10:00.000Z	zerotime		just for the k3b program...
2005-02-18T12:10:00.000Z	zerotime		I hope developers listen our prays
2005-02-18T12:11:00.000Z	Riddell	zerotime	k3b requires kdelibs and for some reason kcontrol I think, otherwise you don't need anything else from kde
2005-02-18T12:11:00.000Z	zerotime	Riddell	well, ill install kde
