2009-07-18T13:43:00.000Z	grody	jaimani	it should already be installed on your system
2009-07-18T13:43:00.000Z	grody	jaimani	just type glxgears on your console
2009-07-18T13:43:00.000Z	jaimani		ok

2009-07-18T13:45:00.000Z	jaimani		glxgears is doing somthin like a benchmark in the background
2009-07-18T13:45:00.000Z	grody	jaimani	it basically measure BASIC 3d performance of your card
2009-07-18T13:46:00.000Z	grody		more fps the better
