2007-08-30T11:53:00.000Z	elYase	genii	, ok i installed the openssh packet but i still can conect to the other ubuntu machine
2007-08-30T12:09:00.000Z	genii	elYase	OK, so in same local network.
2007-08-30T11:58:00.000Z	genii	elYase	On the machine you want to connect to , you install the openssh-server. it shoudl run the program sshd waiting for a connection. then from the client machine you need the package openssh-client. When you want to connect from there to server you do like ssh -l <usernametoconnectas> 111.112.113.114    where that IP number is the IP of your server machine to connect to.
2007-08-30T12:00:00.000Z	elYase	genii	it says conection refused on port 22
2007-08-30T12:01:00.000Z	elYase	genii	the daemon is already running
2007-08-30T12:01:00.000Z	elYase	genii	yaser@auger35:~$ sudo /etc/init.d/ssh start
2007-08-30T12:02:00.000Z	genii	elYase	ssh is NOT sshd   sshd is the server
2007-08-30T12:02:00.000Z	elYase	genii	ok, but the other machine can conect to me
2007-08-30T12:02:00.000Z	elYase	genii	ok, but the other machine cant conect to me
2007-08-30T12:03:00.000Z	genii	elYase	can or can't connect?
2007-08-30T12:03:00.000Z	elYase	genii	cant
2007-08-30T12:03:00.000Z	elYase	genii	it says conection refused on port 22
2007-08-30T12:07:00.000Z	genii	elYase	Are the two machines connected through a switch or hub, or are they separated in between someplace by a router for instance.
2007-08-30T12:09:00.000Z	genii	elYase	Because you may need to open up or forward port 22
2007-08-30T12:09:00.000Z	elYase	genii	well i dont really know the diference but i can tell you that i connect with a Fedora machine that is in the same conditions, that is in the same local network
2007-08-30T12:11:00.000Z	elYase	genii	yea
2007-08-30T12:12:00.000Z	genii	elYase	And on the machine you are trying to connect to when you do sudo ps ax|grep sshd     you see it running?
2007-08-30T12:12:00.000Z	genii	elYase	Not the one trying to connect but the ssh server
2007-08-30T12:13:00.000Z	elYase	genii	yea it is running
