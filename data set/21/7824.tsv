2008-04-13T03:49:00.000Z	omar		yo in my gnome desktop im missing the shutdown option any idea anyone?
2008-04-13T03:50:00.000Z	alex-weej	omar	are you using GDM?
2008-04-13T03:51:00.000Z	alex-weej	omar	are you sure it's GDM and not KDM?
2008-04-13T03:51:00.000Z	alex-weej	omar	that's not true, you can log in to GNOME via KDM
2008-04-13T03:54:00.000Z	alex-weej	omar	"pidof gdm"
2008-04-13T03:54:00.000Z	alex-weej	omar	if it's running, it'll give you a number
2008-04-13T03:54:00.000Z	alex-weej	omar	yes. you're running kdm.
2008-04-13T03:55:00.000Z	alex-weej	omar	no
2008-04-13T03:55:00.000Z	alex-weej	omar	this is called getting rid of that KDE shit
2008-04-13T03:56:00.000Z	alex-weej	omar	install "galternatives"
2008-04-13T03:56:00.000Z	alex-weej	omar	it's a nice tool for looking at the "Alternatives" system in Debian
2008-04-13T03:57:00.000Z	alex-weej	omar	basically when 2 packages provide the same function for some feature, whether it be a flash plugin (Adobe/Gnash/Swfdec) or a login manager (kdm/gdm/xdm/etc.), you can configure it with Alternatives
2008-04-13T03:57:00.000Z	alex-weej	omar	you will have to look down the list to find the DM and switch it over
2008-04-13T03:57:00.000Z	alex-weej	omar	when you find it, let me know what name it's listed as because i'm wondering myself!
2008-04-13T03:58:00.000Z	alex-weej	omar	i think it might be default-x-display-manager
2008-04-13T04:03:00.000Z	omar	alex-weej	I couldnt find anything related to DM options
2008-04-13T04:04:00.000Z	alex-weej	omar	did you find default-x-display-manager?
2008-04-13T04:04:00.000Z	alex-weej	omar	on the list on the left?
2008-04-13T04:06:00.000Z	alex-weej	omar	ok hold on let me see
2008-04-13T04:08:00.000Z	alex-weej	omar	sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm
2008-04-13T04:10:00.000Z	omar	alex-weej	thanks a lot man!
