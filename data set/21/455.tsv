2011-12-06T14:37:00.000Z	INodeNotHere		how can i run a ubuntu system upgrade from the terminal
2011-12-06T14:39:00.000Z	mazda01	INodeNotHere	sudo aptitude dist-upgrade?
2011-12-06T14:39:00.000Z	INodeNotHere	mazda01	thanks
2011-12-06T14:39:00.000Z	mazda01	INodeNotHere	although please google that first
2011-12-06T14:39:00.000Z	INodeNotHere	mazda01	you right i should have sorry
2011-12-06T14:39:00.000Z	mazda01	INodeNotHere	i haven't upgraded in a long time and it may have changed
2011-12-06T14:40:00.000Z	mazda01	INodeNotHere	no, I mean I may be wrong
2011-12-06T14:40:00.000Z	INodeNotHere	mazda01	i googled it you are right
2011-12-06T14:40:00.000Z	mazda01	INodeNotHere	you can also issue man aptitude and read the man pages. Great toilet reading
2011-12-06T14:41:00.000Z	INodeNotHere	mazda01	haha thanks
2011-12-06T14:41:00.000Z	mazda01	INodeNotHere	or man apt-get   and I was dead serious. THe "man" pages are very very helpful
2011-12-06T14:42:00.000Z	mazda01	INodeNotHere	you could try to drop to tty1, issue sudo aptitude remove --purge gnome-desktop. then install that again
2011-12-06T14:43:00.000Z	INodeNotHere	mazda01	thanks that sounds like a great idea
2011-12-06T14:48:00.000Z	mazda01	INodeNotHere	trying single user mode, or fail safe mode from grub most liekly wont solve your issue
2011-12-06T14:49:00.000Z	INodeNotHere	mazda01	the system does boot fine, i think the issue is something todo with gnome. i get everything OK when the system boots. just the GUI doesnt kick in right
2011-12-06T14:49:00.000Z	mazda01	INodeNotHere	if it did crash during a upgrade, you just have to work thru the items that didn't get upgraded OR start again BUT first backing up your stuff you can't lose. so you would use a live cd or usb stick, mount the partition you want to restrieve data from, save it elsewhere, then feel confident you can do a fresh install
2011-12-06T14:49:00.000Z	INodeNotHere	mazda01	sounds like a plan, thanks
2011-12-06T14:50:00.000Z	mazda01	INodeNotHere	well, if it is merely a gnome thing, drop to tty1 and install a new desktop manager
2011-12-06T14:51:00.000Z	INodeNotHere	mazda01	i think there might be more to it than that, first i will run an updrade-dist through chroot, i just need to figure out what "cp: not writing through dangling symlink `/mnt/etc/resolv.conf'" means first, trying to get dns working in the chroot
2011-12-06T14:52:00.000Z	mazda01	INodeNotHere	like xfce4 or even kde
2011-12-06T14:53:00.000Z	mazda01	INodeNotHere	why? you can't connect to the internet?
