2008-12-04T22:17:00.000Z	DrOni	znik	basically your trackpad drivers didn't install
2008-12-04T22:17:00.000Z	DrOni	znik	do a google search specifically for your model and see if there are any linux drivers available for it?
2008-12-04T22:17:00.000Z	znik	DrOni	but the trackpad is moving but erratically
2008-12-04T22:18:00.000Z	DrOni	znik	oh, well then they're just bad drivers! I can't help you sorry :(
2008-12-04T22:19:00.000Z	znik	DrOni	last time when i had the problem i had to just edit the /etx/x11/xorg.conf file and edit the input device part but in 8.10 thr is only "device" section , no "input device" !!!!!

2008-12-04T22:21:00.000Z	znik	DrOni	thr is a same problem in ubuntu forum but thr r no answers!!
2008-12-04T22:21:00.000Z	DrOni	znik	try adding an 'input device' section, do you know what you added last time?
2008-12-04T22:21:00.000Z	DrOni	znik	try adding that - if it doesn't work then you might have to wait until someone replies on the forums
2008-12-04T22:21:00.000Z	znik	DrOni	i have added that part.but i wanted to make sure before restarting!
2008-12-04T22:21:00.000Z	DrOni	znik	it's worth a shot - it should do any serious harm
2008-12-04T22:22:00.000Z	DrOni	znik	shouldn't*
2008-12-04T22:22:00.000Z	znik	DrOni	you just gave me a heart attack
