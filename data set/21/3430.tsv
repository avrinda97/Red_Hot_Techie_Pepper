2009-01-02T10:34:00.000Z	FaithWallis		I just installed Ubuntu 8.10 on an old box we had sitting around.  I am done with the install and got the disk out, restarted the machine...and now there are NO icons or menus for me to use...and the screen is a llittle wierd.  it is like it is a little smooshed to the right (like the desktop wallpaper ahs been smooshed) I checked all the files before installing...they checked out fine.
2009-01-02T10:36:00.000Z	FaithWallis		<--- absolute and complete newbie....please be gentle. :)
2009-01-02T10:36:00.000Z	Arenlor	FaithWallis	can you post a screenshot somewhere for me?
2009-01-02T10:39:00.000Z	Arenlor	FaithWallis	did you do a cd self check?
2009-01-02T10:40:00.000Z	Arenlor	FaithWallis	happy with it now or need/want any more help?
2009-01-02T10:41:00.000Z	Arenlor	FaithWallis	please excuse the misunderstanding, I'm not saying you're bugging me
2009-01-02T10:42:00.000Z	Arenlor	FaithWallis	I've often come in here to ask a question and right before asking it thought of something to try
2009-01-02T10:42:00.000Z	FaithWallis	Arenlor	thank you. :)
2009-01-02T10:43:00.000Z	FaithWallis	Arenlor	this is SO cool.  first time I've used it.
2009-01-02T10:43:00.000Z	Arenlor	FaithWallis	do you know how to open a terminal?
2009-01-02T10:44:00.000Z	Arenlor	FaithWallis	Alright, after that if you have any questions let me know, I was going to show you how to customize what is known as Compiz, which contains for example the "Desktop Cube"
2009-01-02T10:46:00.000Z	FaithWallis	Arenlor	I will probably definitely want to know hwo to do that....my main reason for doing this is I got a box at my parents' house that they didn't want...it was complete trashed but I figured I could see if I coulkd get Linux to run on it ...I also want to see if I can get my Windows-based PE-Design software (for a Brother sewing machine) to run on it to dedicate this box in my sewing room
2009-01-02T10:48:00.000Z	Arenlor	FaithWallis	to get a Windows (in here you'll here it called M$, Doze, WinDoze, or the like btw) program to run you should try Wine. To get the Compiz stuff you can go to Application > Accessories > Terminal (the command line) and type in "sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager" then enter your password. After that go to System > Preferences > CompizConfig
2009-01-02T10:51:00.000Z	Arenlor	FaithWallis	remember this; there is no dumb question on here
2009-01-02T10:52:00.000Z	FaithWallis	Arenlor	:)  I feel better. :)
2009-01-02T10:58:00.000Z	Arenlor	FaithWallis	Options in Firefox for Linux is located in Edit > Preferences just so you know
2009-01-02T10:59:00.000Z	FaithWallis	Arenlor	ah...OK. sorry....and I just did something in mine and it didn't work really well.
2009-01-02T11:01:00.000Z	Arenlor	FaithWallis	you don't need to apologize for not knowing in here
2009-01-02T11:02:00.000Z	Arenlor	FaithWallis	did you uncheck the box to allow them to have style sheets?
2009-01-02T11:02:00.000Z	Arenlor	FaithWallis	I've been using FF since version 1, so I'm a little versed in it lol
