2007-01-07T06:37:00.000Z	rogue780		how do I make cron jobs run as root?
2007-01-07T06:37:00.000Z	mnoir	rogue780	either add to root's crontab or use the crontabes in /etc
2007-01-07T06:37:00.000Z	rogue780	mnoir	Malagmyr, crontab? I've just been using kcron...
2007-01-07T06:38:00.000Z	mnoir	rogue780	the ctontabs in /etc are prolly a better choice
2007-01-10T17:41:00.000Z	mnoir	rogue780	man grep and pay attention to -R
2007-01-10T17:43:00.000Z	rogue780	mnoir	that won't show me the contents of the file though...
2007-01-10T17:44:00.000Z	mnoir	rogue780	it shows you the line that has the match.  if you want to see the fiule, make grep only print the file names and pipe to cat
2007-01-10T17:44:00.000Z	rogue780	mnoir	cat?
2007-01-10T17:44:00.000Z	mnoir	rogue780	man cat to learn more
2007-01-10T17:44:00.000Z	mnoir	rogue780	or pipe to vi
2007-01-10T17:45:00.000Z	rogue780	mnoir	pipe it...
2007-01-10T17:45:00.000Z	mnoir	rogue780	to edit i mean
2007-01-10T17:45:00.000Z	mnoir	rogue780	let me slow down a bit
2007-01-10T17:46:00.000Z	rogue780	mnoir	please...I'm doing my best, but I'm a windows convert
2007-01-10T17:46:00.000Z	mnoir	rogue780	often one unix command does part of a job and another does another part
2007-01-10T17:46:00.000Z	rogue780	mnoir	I'm with you so far
2007-01-10T17:46:00.000Z	mnoir	rogue780	so we connect the output of one command to the input of the next
2007-01-10T17:47:00.000Z	mnoir	rogue780	this may be easier in a p,....
2007-01-10T17:47:00.000Z	rogue780	mnoir	did you get the pm? I've had issues before
2007-01-10T17:49:00.000Z	mnoir	rogue780	try joining #ubuntuuu
