2007-08-31T09:54:00.000Z	stefano		Is there a way to make Rhythmbox media player to default to alsa?
2007-08-31T09:55:00.000Z	stefano		Anything that does sound complains about device not being free.
2007-08-31T09:57:00.000Z	stefano		wget :D
2007-08-31T09:57:00.000Z	stefano		lynx isn't a default installed package, so its better to tell the noob to use wget
2007-08-31T09:58:00.000Z	stefano		Gutsy is not so unstable :P
2007-08-31T09:58:00.000Z	stefano		Do you need to dfrag with linux?
2007-08-31T09:58:00.000Z	stefano		i don't know what you mean with auto mouse.
2007-08-31T09:59:00.000Z	stefano		But my scroll mouse has been working since feisty.
2007-08-31T10:00:00.000Z	Evanlec	stefano	i mean a simpler gui config for multi-button mice
2007-08-31T10:00:00.000Z	stefano	Evanlec	is that the Preference->Mouse thing?
2007-08-31T10:01:00.000Z	Evanlec	stefano	yes but with options to configure the mouse buttons
2007-08-31T10:01:00.000Z	stefano	Evanlec	not mine. Maybe it is still in dev.
2007-08-31T10:01:00.000Z	stefano		On the whole, Gutsy installs for me in under 20 mins of my life.
2007-08-31T10:02:00.000Z	stefano		Compared to the feisty of 30+ mins.
2007-08-31T10:03:00.000Z	Evanlec	stefano	too bad i think gutsy could really use a simpler mouse config
2007-08-31T10:03:00.000Z	stefano	Evanlec	i don't think that simpler than this would be any good.
2007-08-31T10:04:00.000Z	Evanlec	stefano	only thing is forward/back buttons, really could use those argh
2007-08-31T10:04:00.000Z	stefano	Evanlec	ah you have that kind of "web" mouse.
2007-08-31T10:05:00.000Z	Evanlec	stefano	yea and i agree half the buttons on the mouse i dont bother with, but the forward/back really are quite handy
2007-08-31T10:05:00.000Z	Evanlec		mehdi, could do that too i spose
2007-08-31T10:05:00.000Z	stefano	Evanlec	i would say so. I hate to leave the mouse when i am concentrated reading stuff on the web.
