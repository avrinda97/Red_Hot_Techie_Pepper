2004-11-02T14:05:00.000Z	zenwhen		I dont have it installed now. I was just wondering. If  have probelms with the official release Ill be sure to make a bug report.
2004-11-02T14:05:00.000Z	zenwhen		redhat-network-config in ubuntu would ROCK

2004-11-02T14:06:00.000Z	zenwhen		network-device-config
2004-11-02T14:06:00.000Z	zenwhen		Because network-device-config works EXACTLY how it should. Its the only good option for configuring wvdial with a gui.

2004-11-02T14:24:00.000Z	Nonphasis	zenwhen	I disagree. KDE 3.2 was the first desktop that made me think Linux desktop is *ready*
2004-11-02T14:25:00.000Z	Nonphasis	zenwhen	kde4 does tha hal/dbus dance
2004-11-02T14:34:00.000Z	Nonphasis	zenwhen	like, say, Linux kernel? ;-)
