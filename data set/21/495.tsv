2011-11-10T13:18:00.000Z	volition_		Hello all
2011-11-10T13:19:00.000Z	volition_		how can i remove various os from boot time
2011-11-10T13:19:00.000Z	volition_		how ?
2011-11-10T13:20:00.000Z	auronandace	volition_	you are meant to edit the files in /etc/grub.d/ and then run sudo update-grub
2011-11-10T13:24:00.000Z	volition_	auronandace	 this is the ouput of this command http://pastebin.com/3V1CZxEW
2011-11-10T13:25:00.000Z	auronandace	volition_	why do you want to remove 10.04 from grub?
2011-11-10T13:27:00.000Z	volition_	auronandace	Actually i have more than 4 os installed in my system, and now i want to remove the names of 2 os
2011-11-10T13:28:00.000Z	auronandace	volition_	why just the names? don't you want to delete their partitions to recover the diskspace?
2011-11-10T13:29:00.000Z	volition_	auronandace	if possible then sure can u please explain me how
2011-11-10T13:30:00.000Z	auronandace	volition_	use gparted, you should be able to tell which partition has which os on it
2011-11-10T13:30:00.000Z	volition_	auronandace	i think this is more complicated and i have no much time for that so please tell me how to delete the name only
2011-11-10T13:31:00.000Z	auronandace	volition_	i hope somebody else can help you (i think it is a waste just to delete the name)
2011-11-10T13:31:00.000Z	auronandace	volition_	grub would re-detect them every time it updates
2011-11-10T13:39:00.000Z	volition_	auronandace	what can  i do please help me
2011-11-10T13:40:00.000Z	volition_	auronandace	i i want to remove all those stuffs how is it possible like name and partitions also
2011-11-10T13:41:00.000Z	volition_	auronandace	there ?
2011-11-10T13:42:00.000Z	auronandace	volition_	use gparted
2011-11-10T13:43:00.000Z	auronandace	volition_	would probably be best to use it from a livecd (i tend to use the partedmagic livecd)
2011-11-10T13:44:00.000Z	volition_	auronandace	i have an live cd also
2011-11-10T13:45:00.000Z	auronandace	volition_	boot into it and then run gparted from it
2011-11-10T13:46:00.000Z	volition_	auronandace	wait now i am online on my other system and continue this job
