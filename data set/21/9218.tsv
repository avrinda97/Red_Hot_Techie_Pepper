2005-10-21T09:13:00.000Z	nalioth	SEJeff	not as good as macromedia, but on my ibook, some is better than none
2005-10-21T09:13:00.000Z	SEJeff	nalioth	Very true. Does it work with firefox?
2005-10-21T09:14:00.000Z	nalioth	SEJeff	yes it does, but as xophEr pointed out, there is a cvs version of gplflash2, which if IT works, should be much nicer
