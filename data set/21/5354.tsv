2010-05-07T02:10:00.000Z	extor		I formatted 800GB worth of pr0n, warez, cbtz, isos and VMs by mistake. Any suggestions as to how to recover? I tried diskinternals linux recovery and R-Linux but they couldn't find the old stuff :(
2010-05-07T02:11:00.000Z	Vigo	extor	ddrescue and about fifteen others could or might work.
2010-05-07T02:12:00.000Z	Vigo	extor	It has grown some, pulling up a few links now....
2010-05-07T02:13:00.000Z	extor	Vigo	there are actually two dd-rescue apps are there not, that get confused with each other? I seem to remember that from ages ago.
2010-05-07T02:14:00.000Z	Vigo	extor	correct: http://www.debianadmin.com/recover-data-from-a-dead-hard-drive-using-ddrescue.html
2010-05-07T02:14:00.000Z	Vigo	extor	You could dban it and then dd_rescue to salvage it.
2010-05-07T02:15:00.000Z	extor	Vigo	the hard drive is alive and kicking but the ext3 partition has been reformatted and 2% overwritten mistakenly
2010-05-07T02:15:00.000Z	Vigo	extor	I think dd_rescue would or should work. did you see the link?
2010-05-07T02:16:00.000Z	extor	Vigo	no I'm going to check the link out in a bit. So you are saying it doesnt just do raw disk image dumps but also gets involved in heuristics?
2010-05-07T02:18:00.000Z	Vigo	extor	It will recover and repair many ext2, and now maybe ext3, I think I would dban it just to be certain.
2010-05-07T02:20:00.000Z	extor	Vigo	isn't dban a data nuking proggy?
2010-05-07T02:20:00.000Z	Vigo	extor	http://www.linux.com/archive/feature/48092 and http://www.linuxforums.org/forum/linux-newbie/114334-dban.html
2010-05-07T02:21:00.000Z	Vigo	extor	Yes, nuke it then start fresh and no bugs, or use the Debian Recovery Console or utilities.
2010-05-07T02:23:00.000Z	extor	Vigo	hold on, you are telling me to secure erase all the data on the partition I am trying to recover data from?
2010-05-07T02:24:00.000Z	Vigo	extor	No, use the recovery dd_rescue or something like  it, then I personally would nuke it and start fresh with any data saved.
2010-05-07T02:26:00.000Z	extor	Vigo	but whats the point if any of secure erasing the drive?
2010-05-07T02:27:00.000Z	Vigo	extor	After the data save, to be certain that all blocks and sectors are 'clean'
2010-05-07T02:31:00.000Z	extor	Vigo	what do you mean by data being "clean" and why wouldn't I just zero it all out instead of this crazy multiple rewrite technique..
2010-05-07T02:35:00.000Z	Vigo	extor	I mean clean as in clean data sectors so that are working and not bad blocks. If you dban it is almost like a new new drive , no spin rate delays and whatnots.
2010-05-07T02:39:00.000Z	extor	Vigo	is there any advantage to dbanning a hard drive over say...just doing a dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda a couple of times?
2010-05-07T02:40:00.000Z	Vigo	extor	It is about the same, I only went into dban because of the state of the drive data and any corruptions it may now contain, but yes, you are correct.
