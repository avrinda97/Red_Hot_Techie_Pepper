2006-07-12T06:50:00.000Z	Malin		where can i find linux-headers for 2.6.15-21 kernel?
2006-07-12T06:50:00.000Z	Malin		there are none at packages.ubuntu.com
2006-07-12T06:50:00.000Z	cwillu	Malin	if that's the one you have installed via the normal ubuntu update, then linux-headers should work I believe
2006-07-12T06:51:00.000Z	Malin	cwillu	the situation is a bit complicated
2006-07-12T06:53:00.000Z	Malin	cwillu	it's 7/2006
2006-07-12T06:53:00.000Z	cwillu	Malin	are you running a custom kernel, or was there a specific version of the kernel you _had_ to be running?
2006-07-12T06:57:00.000Z	cwillu	Malin	does the cd repo you have have _any_ headers in it?
2006-07-12T06:58:00.000Z	cwillu	Malin	if so, install that version of the kernel + those headers, and in grub, boot from that version of the kernel
2006-07-12T06:58:00.000Z	Malin	cwillu	but i cannot find these headers on packages.ubuntu.com
2006-07-12T06:59:00.000Z	cwillu	Malin	does the dvd you have have them on it?
2006-07-12T06:59:00.000Z	Malin	cwillu	checking...
2006-07-12T06:59:00.000Z	cwillu	Malin	basically, if the dvd has _any_ kernel headers on it, then install those headers and the kernel from the cd to match it, then boot up using that kernel (should give you the option when you boot up and hit escape
2006-07-12T07:03:00.000Z	Malin	cwillu	i think i don't understand
2006-07-12T07:03:00.000Z	cwillu	Malin	you know about sources.list?
2006-07-12T07:03:00.000Z	cwillu	Malin	okay, sources.list should have a cdrom entry in it, right?
2006-07-12T07:06:00.000Z	Malin	cwillu	i'm afraid we don't have the same livecd
2006-07-12T07:08:00.000Z	cwillu	Malin	unless I'm completely misunderstanding you :)
2006-07-12T07:09:00.000Z	Malin	cwillu	i think you're getting everything right :-)
2006-07-12T07:11:00.000Z	cwillu	Malin	yep, the live cd should have the headers on it
2006-07-12T07:11:00.000Z	Malin	cwillu	all i want to do is install usb-eagle :-)
2006-07-12T07:12:00.000Z	cwillu	Malin	_might_ have to apt-get update
