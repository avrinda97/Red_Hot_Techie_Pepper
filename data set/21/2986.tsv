2012-11-19T11:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MiteshShah	add it in /etc/fstab and add the option:   user     and your users can mount the partition
2012-11-19T11:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MiteshShah	user     is the word to add, its not an actual user, it's the word itself
2012-11-19T11:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MiteshShah	/dev/sda4       /media/Storage  ntfs-3g gid=1000,rw,user        0       0                      may do it
2012-11-19T11:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MiteshShah	it will mount at boot, you can add the mount point to the bookmarks for easy access.
2012-11-19T11:39:00.000Z	MiteshShah	ActionParsnip	Already done setting up mount points
