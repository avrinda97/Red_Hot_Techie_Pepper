2008-02-22T23:56:00.000Z	ejer	bluefoxx	looks scary
2008-02-22T23:58:00.000Z	ejer	bluefoxx	not a resolution, bt more explication maybe http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KCQ
2008-02-22T23:59:00.000Z	bluefoxx	ejer	ok, will look at that
2008-02-23T00:04:00.000Z	bluefoxx	ejer	looks scary? for anyone un-interested in learning about something, anything is scary. for me, complicated looking output from commands is interesting[i like to learn]
2008-02-23T00:05:00.000Z	ejer	bluefoxx	to me, either the disk is dying or it needs a low level format
2008-02-23T00:06:00.000Z	bluefoxx	ejer	so how do i do a low level format, if it wont even show in /dev/sd*
2008-02-23T00:06:00.000Z	bluefoxx	ejer	and if it was dying, wouldnt the smart notice it?
2008-02-23T00:07:00.000Z	ejer	bluefoxx	what is this device?
2008-02-23T00:10:00.000Z	bluefoxx	ejer	the scsi drive? its a seagate medalist st34520w 68 pin scsi interface drive, attatched to a 199* pci host adaptor, all salvaged from a school classroom server style computer[it had a pair of 6 gig IDE drives, a p3 and a tape backup drive on it too!all mine now]
2008-02-23T00:11:00.000Z	ejer	bluefoxx	lots of places errors could come from.. it would be nice if you could get rid of adapter
2008-02-23T00:13:00.000Z	bluefoxx	ejer	whycome? is the only one i have, and if i could purchase one online i would but i have no $$ to spare and no monies[sides im pretty sure the adaptor works fine, its been in an anti-static bag during transport and i installed it correctly...and my system refuses to boot if any cards have a problem of any sort:\ good at times...]
2008-02-23T00:14:00.000Z	ejer	bluefoxx	just so many things to test, is it hardware or software? you need to isolate variables a bit
2008-02-23T00:15:00.000Z	bluefoxx	ejer	is which the hardware or software
2008-02-23T00:17:00.000Z	bluefoxx	ejer	i think its the drive...if only i had a second adaptor i would plug it into my testing rig[asus p2b-f with a slocket one 1000mhz celeron, and 384 ram XD] or my grandfathers computer and test it from the adaptor bios
2008-02-23T00:17:00.000Z	ejer	bluefoxx	the drive is corrupt somehow, but you should be able to format still... googling gave a bunch of answers, none easy
2008-02-23T00:18:00.000Z	bluefoxx	ejer	link some?im willing to expirement...maybe a virtual machine?i have one...if there was a way i could use virtual box to emulate a bootup and access the cards bios...
2008-02-23T00:19:00.000Z	ejer	bluefoxx	http://www.google.ca/search?q=Medium+format+corrupted
2008-02-23T00:22:00.000Z	bluefoxx	ejer	my output from scsiadd>http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/56982/
2008-02-23T00:24:00.000Z	bluefoxx	ejer	are there any other scsi/disk utils i can use??...
2008-02-23T01:07:00.000Z	ejer	bluefoxx	backups are for people who like keeping their data :)
