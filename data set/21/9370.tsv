2007-02-07T10:34:00.000Z	ardchoille	lgc	Have you done sudo apt-get dist-upgrade ?
2007-02-07T10:34:00.000Z	ardchoille	lgc	You're using debian repos in Ubuntu?
2007-02-07T10:34:00.000Z	lgc	ardchoille	yes, as of today (I upgraded to Dapper).
2007-02-07T10:35:00.000Z	ardchoille	lgc	Using debian repos in Ubuntu is a really bad idea.
2007-02-07T10:35:00.000Z	lgc	ardchoille	only some...
2007-02-07T10:35:00.000Z	ardchoille	lgc	You're asking for problems, but it's your computer.
2007-02-07T10:36:00.000Z	lgc	ardchoille	Jordan_U, BRB!
2007-02-07T12:10:00.000Z	ardchoille	lgc	What is punctuation of -109
2007-02-07T12:11:00.000Z	ardchoille	lgc	To install more than one app at a time: sudp aptitude install app1 app2 app3 app4
2007-02-07T12:11:00.000Z	lgc	ardchoille	I wish I knew. I'm using aptitude for the first time.
2007-02-07T12:11:00.000Z	ardchoille	lgc	What exactly are you trying to do?
2007-02-07T12:12:00.000Z	ardchoille	lgc	Are you running gnome installed from the ubuntu cd?
2007-02-07T12:13:00.000Z	lgc	ardchoille	no, I've always upgraded from the repos.
2007-02-07T12:14:00.000Z	ardchoille	lgc	If you have run upgrades with debian repos in your /etc/apt/sources.list, then you have probably polluted your system and will have problems from here on. If it were me, I'd re-install Ubuntu and remember to never use debian sources or .deb packages in the future.
2007-02-07T12:17:00.000Z	lgc	ardchoille	not that I cling to my position, but I enabled the debian repositories to install Scribus. Nothing else seems bad except for those 2 packages, "deskbar-applet", and "serpentine", which is a CD writer.
2007-02-07T12:19:00.000Z	ardchoille	lgc	running an upgrade with debian sources can replace many other system packages with newere "debian" packages. You'd have to hunt for those too and replace them. arrenlex seems to know how to revert back to pure Ubuntu, ask him.
2007-02-07T13:15:00.000Z	lgc	ardchoille	the downloading from *pure* Ubuntu sources is progressing quite slow. It'll take a couple of hours more to complete. Since it's 1:15 A.M. local time, I think I will retreat to my chambers to pay a visit to Morpheus.
2007-02-07T13:17:00.000Z	lgc	ardchoille	thank you and good night from Mexico City.
2007-02-07T12:24:00.000Z	lgc	ardchoille	Hi!
2007-02-07T14:37:00.000Z	ardchoille	lgc	Still there?
2007-03-04T16:19:00.000Z	ardchoille	lgc	Please don't randomly hilight people
