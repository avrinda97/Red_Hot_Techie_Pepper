2011-10-08T19:16:00.000Z	codemagician	kennydude	i saw that article and it doesn't work
2011-10-08T19:16:00.000Z	codemagician	kennydude	there is no command line tool called mount_afp
2011-10-08T19:18:00.000Z	kennydude	codemagician	Try http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=636125
2011-10-08T19:18:00.000Z	kennydude	codemagician	I'm just googling ;)
2011-10-08T19:18:00.000Z	codemagician	kennydude	i tried that too "mount error(22): Invalid argument"
2011-10-08T19:18:00.000Z	codemagician	kennydude	bummer hey
2011-10-08T19:20:00.000Z	kennydude	codemagician	yeah, a bit of a pain. Try going onto the network tab of the File Manager and see if you can find it
2011-10-08T19:30:00.000Z	kennydude	codemagician	I'd try: "//192.168.1.50/Data /media/timecapsule smbfs password=<myp> 0 0"
2011-10-08T19:30:00.000Z	kennydude	codemagician	Just don't kill me if that doesn't work
2011-10-08T19:31:00.000Z	codemagician	kennydude	my fstab seems to have UUID=.... hex code.... /storage/diskname ext4    defaults,errors=remount-ro  0   2
2011-10-08T19:31:00.000Z	kennydude	codemagician	Add it on a new line at the end
2011-10-08T19:31:00.000Z	codemagician	kennydude	im not sure what those UUIDs are
2011-10-08T19:31:00.000Z	codemagician	kennydude	do I need one
2011-10-08T19:32:00.000Z	kennydude	codemagician	Those lines  are telling ubuntu where to mount everything currently, just add another line at the end

2011-10-08T19:37:00.000Z	codemagician	kennydude	how do I tell mount to run the /etc/fstab without rebooting?
