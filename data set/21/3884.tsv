2008-08-28T01:26:00.000Z	divinebovine		i've been reading up on issues with the new xorg in hardy and problems with direct rendering and dpkg-reconfigured being handicapped
2008-08-28T01:27:00.000Z	divinebovine		does anyone have an overall impression of the status of where the xorg stuff is in hard?  i've been plugging hardy in to many machines and almost all of them fail to recognize monitors and video chipsets
2008-08-28T01:28:00.000Z	divinebovine		and in pretty well every single case 3d acceleration is unavailable, except for a few select nvidia equiped machines
2008-08-28T01:28:00.000Z	divinebovine		is xorg detection or direct rendering not working in hardy? is that the consensus?

2008-08-28T01:29:00.000Z	divinebovine	danbhfive	nope
2008-08-28T01:30:00.000Z	danbhfive	divinebovine	damn it!!  I want to know too!!
2008-08-28T01:39:00.000Z	divinebovine	danbhfive	so you have run into the same xorg problems then? no obvious solution either?
2008-08-28T01:40:00.000Z	danbhfive	divinebovine	actually, I haven't had any problems, but I used to.  I just want to know how it works, because people ask allot
2008-08-28T01:41:00.000Z	divinebovine	danbhfive	ah. k.
2008-08-28T01:42:00.000Z	divinebovine	danbhfive	so far no insight on what is going to be done about this ... we are having fairly sizeable problems
2008-08-28T01:42:00.000Z	danbhfive	divinebovine	what are your problems again?
2008-08-28T01:42:00.000Z	danbhfive	divinebovine	video is just not working?
2008-08-28T01:43:00.000Z	danbhfive	divinebovine	have you tried the restricted-manager?
2008-08-28T01:44:00.000Z	danbhfive	divinebovine	are these upgrades, or clean installs?
2008-08-28T01:47:00.000Z	danbhfive	divinebovine	I got one msg saying that xorg just autodetects at startup now.  Thus, xorg.conf can be blank now, but you can add directives as needed.   SO, it would make sense that reconfiguring doesn't work, since its an onboot detection for the most part now
2008-08-28T01:48:00.000Z	divinebovine	danbhfive	i was thinking it was a great idea too until the took out and decapitated dpkg-reconfigure
2008-08-28T01:49:00.000Z	danbhfive	divinebovine	hehe, sometime ubuntu is 2 steps forward, 2 steps back
2008-08-28T01:50:00.000Z	divinebovine	danbhfive	we are deploying ubuntu in corporate environment.  we have had to stop rely in dist-upgrades.  we haveto now deploy full clean images recreated each lts cycle
2008-08-28T01:51:00.000Z	divinebovine	danbhfive	thx for bouncing ideas back and forth
