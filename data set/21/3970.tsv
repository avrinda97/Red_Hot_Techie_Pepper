2008-08-10T07:20:00.000Z	Lithium_Ionic	HttpError	Sorry, no idea then. Hopefully someone else can help. Good luck.
2008-08-10T07:25:00.000Z	HttpError	Lithium_Ionic	i think i found my problem, Tested on Ubuntu 7.04; Ubuntu 7.10 and Linux Mint 4.0 Live CDs
2008-08-10T07:26:00.000Z	Lithium_Ionic	HttpError	Ok, Hope it works!
2008-08-10T07:38:00.000Z	HttpError	Lithium_Ionic	1 more thing, there SATA drives :/
2008-08-10T07:39:00.000Z	Lithium_Ionic	HttpError	Sorry, not a pro here either. Not sure if it will make a big difference. But you must make sure you correctly identify the drive before you write the MBR
2008-08-10T07:39:00.000Z	HttpError	Lithium_Ionic	how do i find it tho?
2008-08-10T07:40:00.000Z	Lithium_Ionic	HttpError	umm, I think its sudo fdisk -l
2008-08-10T07:40:00.000Z	Lithium_Ionic	HttpError	Then look for the ntfs partition
2008-08-10T07:41:00.000Z	HttpError	Lithium_Ionic	nothing came up.
2008-08-10T07:42:00.000Z	Lithium_Ionic	HttpError	Hmm. That should have done it.. Guess I gotta think a sec.
2008-08-10T07:46:00.000Z	HttpError	Lithium_Ionic	im gonna try using a floppy bootdisk.
2008-08-10T07:46:00.000Z	Lithium_Ionic	HttpError	So are you aware of what partition your drive is? Like if it's sda1 or anything? I guess you could open the partition manager on the live disc and look there. It should show. As well, this page might better explain writing it: http://www.arsgeek.com/2008/01/15/how-to-fix-your-windows-mbr-with-an-ubuntu-livecd/ . Lol, I sure wish I would have thought about writing the MBR from ubuntu a few years ago, had to format instead!
2008-08-10T07:49:00.000Z	Lithium_Ionic	HttpError	Alright, floppy boot disc might work too. Sorry missed that. Good luck.
