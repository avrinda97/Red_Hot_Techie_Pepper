2005-06-08T11:39:00.000Z	geetergod		If i just installed Doom3 why cant i find a way to play it?
2005-06-08T11:40:00.000Z	geetergod		it says i need to do 'doom3' in terminal, but it said command not found
2005-06-08T11:40:00.000Z	transgress	geetergod	 locate doom3
2005-06-08T12:30:00.000Z	transgress	geetergod	what vid card?
2005-06-08T12:33:00.000Z	geetergod	transgress	think its something up with my vid card?
2005-06-08T12:34:00.000Z	transgress	geetergod	what did glxinfo | grep direct say?
2005-06-08T12:35:00.000Z	transgress	geetergod	 at a console type in "glxinfo | grep direct" and it will return a line back to you.  show me that line
2005-06-08T12:36:00.000Z	transgress	geetergod	hmm okay
2005-06-08T12:36:00.000Z	transgress	geetergod	then it must have to do with the fact that it can't find that config file
2005-06-08T12:37:00.000Z	transgress	geetergod	updatedb and then locate "name of the .cfg at the end of that error"
2005-06-08T12:37:00.000Z	transgress	geetergod	ah yes... locate default.cfg
2005-06-08T12:39:00.000Z	transgress	geetergod	now locate default.cfg
2005-06-08T12:41:00.000Z	transgress	geetergod	that's your problem then... for some reason you don't have a file needed by doom3
2005-06-08T12:45:00.000Z	geetergod	transgress	what do you recomend i do?
2005-06-08T12:45:00.000Z	transgress	geetergod	i'd probably search on the cd for it
2005-06-08T12:58:00.000Z	geetergod	transgress	when i put glxgears into terminal i get this...
2005-06-08T12:59:00.000Z	transgress	geetergod	umm you have a video card problem... you get great FPS at first then it breaks your X... so i'd say something is definitely bad
2005-06-08T12:59:00.000Z	transgress	geetergod	that tends to happen to me on my one box when i run out of ram
2005-06-08T13:00:00.000Z	transgress	geetergod	yeah that's damned good
2005-06-08T13:06:00.000Z	transgress	geetergod	cp *pk* might do it
2005-06-08T13:18:00.000Z	transgress	geetergod	you need to copy it to where ever the game is installed to
