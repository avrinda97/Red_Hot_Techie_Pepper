2007-03-04T15:40:00.000Z	loppa		Ive got some problems with my gaim. The log on button is grey, so I cant press it. Any ideas?
2007-03-04T15:41:00.000Z	gyaresu	loppa	hold ALT and right-click with your mouse to drag window size.
2007-03-04T15:41:00.000Z	gyaresu	loppa	(left click drag to move whole window)
2007-03-04T15:42:00.000Z	loppa	gyaresu	I dont think thats the problem, the thing is, I cant log on because the button I'm sposed to press aint "pressable"?
2007-03-04T15:43:00.000Z	gyaresu	loppa	possibly not letting you because of insufficent login information? Or a bug.
2007-03-04T15:43:00.000Z	gyaresu	loppa	New install?
2007-03-04T15:43:00.000Z	loppa	gyaresu	I've created an account, and i've typed the passy, still its gray. So bug then?
2007-03-04T15:44:00.000Z	gyaresu	loppa	Tryed upgrading?
2007-03-04T15:44:00.000Z	loppa	gyaresu	upgrading the gaim?
2007-03-04T15:44:00.000Z	gyaresu	loppa	yep. Is it a new ubuntu install?
2007-03-04T15:45:00.000Z	loppa	gyaresu	actually its Suse 10.2, but theres no people in the suse channel.
2007-03-04T15:45:00.000Z	loppa	gyaresu	so I figured i'd try here, and then hope somebody knew anything 'bout it.
2007-03-04T15:46:00.000Z	gyaresu	loppa	Then you still want to upgrade the system.
2007-03-04T15:46:00.000Z	loppa	gyaresu	the whole thing?
2007-03-04T15:47:00.000Z	gyaresu	loppa	Start with upgrading gaim if you can.
2007-03-04T15:47:00.000Z	loppa	gyaresu	have to use yast then?
2007-03-04T15:47:00.000Z	gyaresu	loppa	pft! i have no idea :)
2007-03-04T15:48:00.000Z	loppa	gyaresu	that would be the same thing as synaptic in ubuntu. SOrt of.
2007-03-04T15:48:00.000Z	gyaresu	loppa	yes it is.
2007-03-04T15:49:00.000Z	loppa	gyaresu	eventually, there might be some other clients I could use?
2007-03-04T15:49:00.000Z	gyaresu	loppa	Yes you can use other clients.
