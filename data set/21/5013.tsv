2008-01-14T00:43:00.000Z	SuaveIV		...it's a bad thing when the installer doesn't seem to want to recoginze your hard drive, right?
2008-01-14T00:43:00.000Z	MenZa	SuaveIV	Yes, that is a bad thing. Which type of harddrive do you have? SATA? IDE? SCSI?
2008-01-14T00:50:00.000Z	SuaveIV	MenZa	 absolutely nothing
2008-01-14T00:45:00.000Z	SuaveIV	MenZa	SATA, and the odd thing is that GPartEd seems to recognize it without fail
2008-01-14T00:46:00.000Z	MenZa	SuaveIV	Ubuntu uses gparted to partition its drives, I believe. Try sudo fdisk -l in a terminal. !pastebin the output.
2008-01-14T00:50:00.000Z	SuaveIV	MenZa	ummm, there was nothing to paste...
2008-01-14T00:50:00.000Z	MenZa	SuaveIV	Seriously? Nothing?
2008-01-14T00:52:00.000Z	SuaveIV	MenZa	which is strange, cause I can clearly remember ubuntu seeing that HDD before...
2008-01-14T00:52:00.000Z	MenZa	SuaveIV	It really doesn't see any drive... that's strange.
2008-01-14T00:53:00.000Z	SuaveIV	MenZa	tell me about it, especially since the LiveCD GParted sees it right away
2008-01-14T00:53:00.000Z	MenZa	SuaveIV	That's a really strange issue.
2008-01-14T00:55:00.000Z	SuaveIV	MenZa	 though it has absolutetly no problem seeing my iPod as a HDD
2008-01-14T01:12:00.000Z	SuaveIV	MenZa	 I think I found what might be the problem...
2008-01-14T01:13:00.000Z	MenZa	SuaveIV	Oh?
2008-01-14T01:13:00.000Z	MenZa	SuaveIV	You're on a 2.6.15 kernel O_o?
2008-01-14T01:16:00.000Z	MenZa	SuaveIV	I would've stuck to the original LiveCDs...
2008-01-14T01:17:00.000Z	MenZa	SuaveIV	I see.
2008-01-14T01:18:00.000Z	MenZa	SuaveIV	hmm, I wouldn't assume so.
2008-01-14T01:22:00.000Z	MenZa	SuaveIV	good quesiton
2008-01-14T01:22:00.000Z	MenZa	SuaveIV	question too
2008-01-14T01:31:00.000Z	MenZa	SuaveIV	Then the bug *shouldn't* apply to it.
