2007-01-07T09:49:00.000Z	friedeggs		hello, I need help...after the default login screen, when the desktop is loading, the system is hanging, badly, the whole screen is just a solid peach colour, and a white box appears in the upper left hand corner...it looks like it wants to be a terminal there, but nothing can be typed in...help
2007-01-07T09:49:00.000Z	burepe_	friedeggs	I had that same problem
2007-01-07T09:49:00.000Z	burepe_	friedeggs	did you change the resolution?
2007-01-07T09:49:00.000Z	friedeggs	kiwinz_sucks	I tried to start failsafe, same thing
2007-01-07T09:50:00.000Z	friedeggs		mysystem was being weird before the restart
2007-01-07T09:50:00.000Z	friedeggs		cpu was maxed out, but nothing was opened, and the system monitor would not open
2007-01-07T09:51:00.000Z	friedeggs	kiwinz_sucks	how would I reset gnome?
2007-01-07T09:51:00.000Z	burepe_	friedeggs	did you just install? when you installed was the resolution 800x600 but too low? That was what happend to me. then I changed the resolution and I had your same problem. I reinstalled to get rid of it but now I still have low resolution
2007-01-07T09:52:00.000Z	friedeggs		burepe:no
2007-01-07T09:52:00.000Z	friedeggs		reinstalling is not really an option yet
2007-01-07T09:52:00.000Z	friedeggs		if I can find out what is causing the system to hang...
2007-01-07T09:53:00.000Z	burepe_	friedeggs	if you find out let me know in case I have it again
2007-01-07T09:53:00.000Z	friedeggs		sure
2007-01-07T09:53:00.000Z	friedeggs		I think it is gnome
2007-01-07T09:53:00.000Z	friedeggs		but I need to know how to reset gnome, in case it went haywire somehow
2007-01-07T09:54:00.000Z	friedeggs	kiwinz_sucks	how would I reinstall gnome, you know, reset it to it's original settings
2007-01-07T09:55:00.000Z	friedeggs		castoff:no, not just restart x, I mean reload gnome...reinstall it
2007-01-07T09:55:00.000Z	friedeggs		screen just went black on said sick comp
2007-01-07T09:56:00.000Z	friedeggs		easy enough
2007-01-07T09:56:00.000Z	friedeggs		brb
2007-01-07T09:56:00.000Z	burepe_	friedeggs	that ubuntu desktop install takes a long time I think
