2011-08-19T14:11:00.000Z	ranjan	urlin2u	:( that feature is not working
2011-08-19T14:11:00.000Z	ranjan	urlin2u	even i installed the gpointing-device-settings
2011-08-19T14:12:00.000Z	ranjan	urlin2u	its all ok all the settings are to disable the touchpad
2011-08-19T14:12:00.000Z	urlin2u	ranjan	the button does not work?
2011-08-19T14:12:00.000Z	ranjan	urlin2u	its not a button, its also a touchpad
2011-08-19T14:12:00.000Z	ranjan	urlin2u	it toggles the whole touchpad
2011-08-19T14:13:00.000Z	urlin2u	ranjan	hmm strange.
2011-08-19T14:15:00.000Z	urlin2u	ranjan	page 8 #4 reads as TouchPad on/off button Enables/disables the TouchPad.   you saw this correct?
2011-08-19T14:16:00.000Z	ranjan	urlin2u	yes, in my case that on/off stuff is at the corner of touchpad itself, a small silver box like drawing, and its not a push button
2011-08-19T14:17:00.000Z	urlin2u	ranjan	cool very strange.
2011-08-19T14:18:00.000Z	ranjan	urlin2u	have you not seen such a touchpad before?
2011-08-19T14:18:00.000Z	urlin2u	ranjan	I have acer netbook it is a recessed pad, I use a mouse.
