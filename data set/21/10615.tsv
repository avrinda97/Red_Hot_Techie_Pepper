2005-05-22T13:30:00.000Z	HappyFool	tritium	is this policy outlined anywhere on the website/wiki? it's certainly a FAQ (especially for firefox, for some reason)
2005-05-22T13:31:00.000Z	tritium	HappyFool	not that I'm aware of...

2005-07-20T14:26:00.000Z	tritium	HappyFool	backports in general is not "favored", but you're right
2005-07-27T13:28:00.000Z	HappyFool	tritium	do you have any extensions?
2005-07-27T13:28:00.000Z	tritium	HappyFool	no
2005-07-27T13:29:00.000Z	HappyFool	tritium	there's a thread about this on ubuntuforums -- it looks like ppl without problems generally don't have extensions installed
2005-07-27T13:29:00.000Z	tritium	HappyFool	ah, thanks.  Not that it's a problem to not have problems ;)
2005-07-28T15:13:00.000Z	tritium	HappyFool	yes, ubuntuguide should not be recommended, in general
2005-10-08T11:58:00.000Z	tritium	HappyFool	and "izzat"? ;)
2005-10-08T11:58:00.000Z	HappyFool	tritium	inconsistency is the hob-troll of miniature minds
2005-10-08T11:59:00.000Z	tritium	HappyFool	who's being inconsistent?
2005-10-08T11:59:00.000Z	HappyFool	tritium	just a joke, nm ;)
2006-03-09T11:54:00.000Z	HappyFool	tritium	what is this dcc string 0 thing ?
