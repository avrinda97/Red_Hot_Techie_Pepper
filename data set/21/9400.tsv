2006-04-06T10:57:00.000Z	Fitzsimmons		can someone give me a hand?  everything related to apt segfaults
2006-04-06T10:57:00.000Z	Fitzsimmons		no error messages...
2006-04-06T10:59:00.000Z	Fitzsimmons		where can I find a .deb for apt?
2006-04-06T11:01:00.000Z	Fitzsimmons		seriously, someone must know where to find a deb for apt, I need to get my system fixed
2006-04-06T11:02:00.000Z	_jason	Fitzsimmons	packages.ubuntu.com
2006-04-06T11:03:00.000Z	Fitzsimmons	_jason	then what?
2006-04-06T11:03:00.000Z	_jason	Fitzsimmons	then you find a .deb for every package in the ubuntu repositories
2006-04-06T11:03:00.000Z	Fitzsimmons	_jason	I'm having a difficult time finding a deb for it
2006-04-06T11:03:00.000Z	Fitzsimmons	_jason	sources, package lists, but no debs
2006-04-06T11:04:00.000Z	_jason	Fitzsimmons	it's at the bottom with ``download apt'' http://packages.ubuntu.com/breezy/base/apt
2006-04-06T11:05:00.000Z	Fitzsimmons	_jason	I don't see it
2006-04-06T11:05:00.000Z	_jason	Fitzsimmons	click on the architecture
2006-04-06T11:06:00.000Z	Fitzsimmons	_jason	ah, thanks
2006-04-06T11:06:00.000Z	Fitzsimmons	_jason	that's incredibly unclear
2006-04-06T11:06:00.000Z	_jason	Fitzsimmons	agreed, I didn't understand at first either
2006-04-06T11:06:00.000Z	Fitzsimmons	_jason	sigh, didn't help, apt still segfaults...
2006-04-06T11:07:00.000Z	_jason	Fitzsimmons	I probably won't be able to help with that, sounds very problematic... but we can bounce some ideas around.  Are you using breezy?  when did it start seg faulting?
2006-04-06T11:08:00.000Z	Fitzsimmons	_jason	I'm on dapper, and it started segfaulting... like 30 minutes ago... and I was using it pretty redily
2006-04-06T11:09:00.000Z	_jason	Fitzsimmons	did you make sure to download the deb for dapper?  I linked you to breezy
2006-04-06T11:09:00.000Z	Fitzsimmons	_jason	yes, I'm sure.
2006-04-06T11:09:00.000Z	_jason	Fitzsimmons	could check #ubuntu+1 and see if anyone else is having the problem
