2009-12-30T11:14:00.000Z	digitalaxis		Can someone who is good with linux please tell me why the command given here to get winetricks doesnt work? http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=17908
2009-12-30T11:15:00.000Z	iKernel	digitalaxis	don't know without seeing what error you got.
2009-12-30T11:16:00.000Z	digitalaxis	iKernel	Who said anything about an error? i just cant get the install to start and this page says i need that winetricks package to get the CA Installer to work
2009-12-30T11:16:00.000Z	iKernel	digitalaxis	try using wine version 1.1.29
2009-12-30T11:17:00.000Z	digitalaxis	iKernel	I think thats what i have, how can i tell
2009-12-30T11:17:00.000Z	iKernel	digitalaxis	wine --version
2009-12-30T11:17:00.000Z	iKernel	digitalaxis	also try asking in #winehq
2009-12-30T11:18:00.000Z	digitalaxis	iKernel	ah your right i have an older version, is there a way to upgrade or do i have to re-install
2009-12-30T11:19:00.000Z	iKernel	digitalaxis	installing the new version from scratch IS upgrading in the linux world :)
2009-12-30T11:19:00.000Z	digitalaxis	iKernel	I know, what i am meaning to ask is do i need to uninstall my current
2009-12-30T11:20:00.000Z	iKernel	digitalaxis	which one is your current?
2009-12-30T11:20:00.000Z	digitalaxis	iKernel	1.0.1
2009-12-30T11:20:00.000Z	iKernel	digitalaxis	and yes, you probably will have to. but you can keep most of the stuff in .wine
2009-12-30T11:20:00.000Z	iKernel	digitalaxis	back up ~/.wine and reinstall. you'll probably have to compile from source
2009-12-30T11:22:00.000Z	digitalaxis	iKernel	i cant find a damn download for the latest beta version lol
2009-12-30T11:22:00.000Z	iKernel	digitalaxis	have to compile it from source
2009-12-30T11:22:00.000Z	digitalaxis	iKernel	Where do i get the source
2009-12-30T11:23:00.000Z	iKernel	digitalaxis	from the winehq website
2009-12-30T11:23:00.000Z	digitalaxis	iKernel	nvm found it
2009-12-30T11:23:00.000Z	iKernel	digitalaxis	also install build-essential from ubuntu repos
