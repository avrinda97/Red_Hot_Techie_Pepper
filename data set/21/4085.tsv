2008-07-15T23:34:00.000Z	raydolphin	android6011	Hmmm, no wireless extensions?   I did install it a few weeks ago and it worked fine,  Why did it show as if it is not installed?
2008-07-15T23:34:00.000Z	android6011	raydolphin	did you update the kernel?

2008-07-15T23:39:00.000Z	android6011	raydolphin	you face the same problems i do, no direct support in ubuntu is available for our wireless card
2008-07-15T23:39:00.000Z	android6011	raydolphin	msg me and i will tell you how to get things going quick
2008-07-15T23:39:00.000Z	raydolphin	android6011	but it worked last time, something to do with the eepc drivers??!!
2008-07-15T23:40:00.000Z	android6011	raydolphin	if you updated the kernel since then you will have to recompile the drivers unless you made another change which is causing a problem
2008-07-15T23:58:00.000Z	raydolphin	android6011	Hey, thanks, it works.
2008-07-15T23:59:00.000Z	android6011	raydolphin	np
2008-07-15T23:59:00.000Z	android6011	raydolphin	keep in mind that everytime you update the kernel you will have to go into that madwifi-ng directory and run sudo make clean , sudo make , sudo make install
2008-07-16T00:00:00.000Z	android6011	raydolphin	good idea
2008-07-16T00:00:00.000Z	raydolphin	android6011	hang on, make clean?
2008-07-16T00:00:00.000Z	raydolphin	android6011	so you're saying, go to that cd directory where i put madwifi in, then type sudo make clean?
2008-07-16T00:01:00.000Z	android6011	raydolphin	ya, instead of having to rerun the svn checkout command everytime if you keep that madwifi-ng directory saved on your comp, you need to run the command make clean before you compile the driver for a new kernel
2008-07-16T00:02:00.000Z	android6011	raydolphin	but hopefully support will be added by the next ubuntu update cuz im tired of recompiling the driver every time
2008-07-16T00:02:00.000Z	android6011	raydolphin	no problem, im just glad i could help
2008-07-16T00:03:00.000Z	raydolphin	android6011	lol, re: recompiling.  yeah.  maybe ubuntu 8.10 will be included??
2008-07-16T00:05:00.000Z	raydolphin	android6011	one more thing, how do i spot any update that may affect the wireless, ie. updates from ubuntu's repositories?
2008-07-16T00:05:00.000Z	android6011	raydolphin	if you see anything about a linux kernel or anything madwifi then it may break it
2008-07-16T00:06:00.000Z	android6011	raydolphin	and 8.10 didnt have support a few days ago when i was testing it
