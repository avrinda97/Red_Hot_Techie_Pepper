2008-12-26T15:35:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	deutsch1988_	 LSI/Agere 11c11040 modem chip ... At http://linmodems.technion.ac.il/packages/ltmodem/11c11040/ there may be a package with precompiled drivers with your Kernel-version in its name.
2008-12-26T15:37:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	deutsch1988_	it looks like you rmodem is not normally supported in the linux kernel. you'd need to manually download and install the driver for it
2008-12-26T15:39:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	deutsch1988_	the answer is, i don't reaslly know.. the text file you sent me claims the you need to download the driver for it and compile i, unless there is already a pre-compiled driver for it there --> http://linmodems.technion.ac.il/packages/ltmodem/11c11040/
2008-12-26T15:41:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	deutsch1988_	go here, you might find a driver for your modem ( LSI/Agere 11c11040 modem chip) --> http://linmodems.technion.ac.il/packages/ltmodem/11c11040/
