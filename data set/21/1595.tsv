2010-07-13T04:44:00.000Z	LorgonJortle		Is there any reason I should learn OpenGL with C++ over OpenGL with Java?
2010-07-13T04:45:00.000Z	Garandir	LorgonJortle	Java is known for being slow on runtime
2010-07-13T04:45:00.000Z	LorgonJortle	Garandir	Would Java be nicer to code OGL in?
2010-07-13T04:46:00.000Z	Garandir	LorgonJortle	Java would be a lot easier.
2010-07-13T04:46:00.000Z	LorgonJortle		Why is that?
2010-07-13T04:46:00.000Z	Garandir	LorgonJortle	Java is a common starting language, I've programmed it for a few years. I could even help you
2010-07-13T04:47:00.000Z	LorgonJortle		I've been programming for over 4 years, that's not my worry.
2010-07-13T04:47:00.000Z	Garandir	LorgonJortle	You said C or Java, right?
2010-07-13T04:47:00.000Z	LorgonJortle		I would love help though if I choose it. Thanks!
2010-07-13T04:47:00.000Z	LorgonJortle		Yes
2010-07-13T04:47:00.000Z	LorgonJortle		I've been coding 3D games in XNA for the past two years.
2010-07-13T04:48:00.000Z	LorgonJortle		In C#.
2010-07-13T04:48:00.000Z	LorgonJortle		But before that I coded only C++
2010-07-13T04:48:00.000Z	LorgonJortle		Admittedly... I sucked back then.
2010-07-13T04:48:00.000Z	Garandir	LorgonJortle	Well C is structured while Java is object-oriented...
2010-07-13T04:49:00.000Z	LorgonJortle	Garandir	And I long for my objects... ;-) - Is the slowness of the JRE a huge downfall?
2010-07-13T04:50:00.000Z	Garandir	LorgonJortle	It's not really slow in my opinion.
2010-07-13T04:50:00.000Z	LorgonJortle	Garandir	It seems to me like I'll be workin' with JOGL then. o.O
2010-07-13T04:51:00.000Z	Garandir	LorgonJortle	If you need any Java help feel free to ask
2010-07-13T04:51:00.000Z	LorgonJortle	Garandir	I'm positive I'll take you up on that. May I PM you?
2010-07-13T04:51:00.000Z	Garandir	LorgonJortle	Sure.
