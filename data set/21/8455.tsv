2006-04-05T08:58:00.000Z	zezu		heh
2006-04-05T08:58:00.000Z	zezu		it uses Mesa
2006-04-05T08:58:00.000Z	zezu		mesa is software
2006-04-05T08:58:00.000Z	zezu		(normally)
2006-04-05T09:00:00.000Z	zezu		which normally i would think should mean its hardware accell.
2006-04-05T09:01:00.000Z	zezu		drivers for things like that are really slacking in linux, it can't be helped most of the time
2006-04-05T09:01:00.000Z	zezu		I dont have 3d accell myself
2006-04-05T09:01:00.000Z	zezu		and i have a damn 9800 pro
2006-04-05T09:01:00.000Z	BlueHeron	zezu	why not, it's not hard
2006-04-05T09:02:00.000Z	BlueHeron	zezu	i have a x700 pro and i have 3d accell
2006-04-05T09:02:00.000Z	zezu	BlueHeron	whats not that hard ?
2006-04-05T09:02:00.000Z	BlueHeron	zezu	3d accel
2006-04-05T09:02:00.000Z	BlueHeron	zezu	no it doesn't thats why you use the ATI drivers
2006-04-05T09:02:00.000Z	BlueHeron	zezu	if you want i can help you with it :-P
2006-04-05T09:02:00.000Z	BlueHeron	zezu	the ones from the website?
2006-04-05T09:02:00.000Z	BlueHeron	zezu	they work perfectly
2006-04-05T09:03:00.000Z	BlueHeron	zezu	in a terminal type fglrxinfo and paste the results
2006-04-05T09:04:00.000Z	zezu	BlueHeron	i removed the driver i'm using the generic "ati" drivers atm as it has 2d hardware accell
2006-04-05T09:05:00.000Z	BlueHeron	zezu	it should look like this OpenGL vendor string: ATI Technologies Inc.
2006-04-05T09:05:00.000Z	zezu	BlueHeron	read the above
2006-04-05T09:05:00.000Z	BlueHeron	zezu	grab the driver from the site it does work
