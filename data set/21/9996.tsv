2009-10-23T21:57:00.000Z	dooglus		I found a bug which is already in the launchpad tracker, but marked as 'fix committed' from 2 years ago.  should I raise a duplicate?  or change the status of the old bug?  or what?

2009-12-06T06:25:00.000Z	maco	dooglus	sounds more like you want to get rid of the relatime option in /etc/fstab for mounting your drive
2009-12-06T06:25:00.000Z	maco	dooglus	relatime only updates atime if the atime is older than changed time
2009-12-06T06:25:00.000Z	maco	dooglus	so you have feweer disk accesses and a faster machine
2009-12-06T09:25:00.000Z	dooglus	maco	I don't have the relatime option, and the atime is being updated the first time I access the file, even though the atime is already newer than the mtime

2009-12-11T07:48:00.000Z	maco	dooglus	xrandr
2009-12-11T07:50:00.000Z	dooglus	maco	is that a guess?  there's no mention of BackingStore in the xrandr man page.  I don't think BackingStore is related to the xrandr extension is it?
2009-12-11T07:50:00.000Z	maco	dooglus	i dont know what backingstore is
2009-12-11T07:50:00.000Z	maco	dooglus	just that xrandr is how you configure X now
2009-12-11T07:50:00.000Z	dooglus	maco	xrandr is how you configure the RandR extension only I think
2009-12-11T07:51:00.000Z	maco	dooglus	are you trying to do something other than resolution, panning, screens, etc?
2009-12-11T07:51:00.000Z	dooglus	maco	RandR is "Resize and Rotate"
2009-12-11T07:51:00.000Z	maco	dooglus	aye....? what are you trying to do?
2010-07-29T06:00:00.000Z	maco	dooglus	if you right click the search thingy on firefox you can change the default
2010-07-29T06:00:00.000Z	dooglus	maco	I know how to fix it.  what I don't know is how it sneaked onto the computer.  I'd like to stop it happening again
2010-07-29T06:02:00.000Z	maco	dooglus	when you visit a site that has its own search engine available, the search menu offers to add it to the list (click on the icon for the current search and see the drop down... there'll be one at the bottom of the list if youre on certain sites... ilke youtube does it i think).  she probably hit it not knowing what it was
2010-07-29T06:04:00.000Z	dooglus	maco	the default search in the search box is still google.  it's the "when you type a bad URL" search that was damaged
2010-07-29T06:04:00.000Z	maco	dooglus	oh. mm dunno then
