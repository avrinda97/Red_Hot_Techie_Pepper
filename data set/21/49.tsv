2012-11-08T00:20:00.000Z	tupu		Anyone?
2012-11-08T00:21:00.000Z	tupu		"The program pavucontrol is currently not installed"
2012-11-08T00:21:00.000Z	tupu		Should I install that?
2012-11-08T00:23:00.000Z	tupu		ok installing pavucontrol now
2012-11-08T00:23:00.000Z	tupu		Not sure what it uses.. first time using Lubuntu now (just installed it 20 minutes ago)
2012-11-08T00:23:00.000Z	MelRay	tupu	First thing to do is verify what Ubuntu thinks is the correct sound device..sometimes there is a separate HDMI port that gets selected over the correct
2012-11-08T00:24:00.000Z	tupu	MelRay	ok, thanks, I've tried googling it and gone as far as the Manual Installation part of this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting
2012-11-08T00:24:00.000Z	tupu	MelRay	The problem is, I have no idea what is the name of my soundcard's driver
2012-11-08T00:25:00.000Z	tupu	MelRay	So when I try to type "sudo modprobe snd-ich5" it says incorrec.t..I have no idea how to find what is the name of my soundcard's driver
2012-11-08T00:26:00.000Z	MelRay	tupu	try lsmod to see what modules are loaded..
2012-11-08T00:27:00.000Z	tupu	MelRay	Ok, I ran lsmod and I see names such as snd_intel8x0, snd_ac97_codec
2012-11-08T00:30:00.000Z	MelRay	tupu	Ok so it has the sound driver for intel and ac97... What computer model are you using?
2012-11-08T00:32:00.000Z	tupu	MelRay	Fujitsu Siemens Scenic C
2012-11-08T00:33:00.000Z	tupu	MelRay	I tried commands: sudo modproble snd_intel8x0 and sudo modprobe snd_ac97_codec, neither of them helped
2012-11-08T00:33:00.000Z	MelRay	tupu	Ok open system settings and select multimedia...there should be an option named phonon if you select it that will tell you what sound card is detected
2012-11-08T00:34:00.000Z	MelRay	tupu	lsmod tells you what modules are already loaded....you don't need to load the modules since they are already present...we have to make sure the correct drivers are loaded for the detected soundcard
2012-11-08T00:35:00.000Z	tupu	MelRay	Unfortunately I'm unable to find System Settings in this Lubuntu.. I've tried to look for it, but it's not where it used to be in Ubuntu
2012-11-08T00:38:00.000Z	tupu	MelRay	I found System Profiler and Benchmark, under thre I can see information such as soundcard
2012-11-08T00:38:00.000Z	tupu	MelRay	Intel Corporation 82810EB/ER (ICH5/ICH5R) AC'97 Audio Controller (rev 02)
2012-11-08T00:39:00.000Z	tupu	MelRay	When I look into detailed information of this audio controller, under Kernel modules it says snd-intel8x0
2012-11-08T00:40:00.000Z	tupu	MelRay	When I play music in an adio program, it seems to be playing it normally (no errors or anything), I just can't hear anything
