2010-01-18T01:32:00.000Z	fission6		yea jrib does that cover my need of booting from a thumb drive off 500mb then dual booting and once in place upgrading to a full version of ubuntu

2010-01-18T01:33:00.000Z	fission6		ok
2010-01-18T01:33:00.000Z	FireCrotch	fission6	a 500 MB flash drive won't be enough to do a normal install.  If you have another computer available, you can install the system by booting via PXE and installing that way
2010-01-18T01:36:00.000Z	fission6	FireCrotch	do you think i can use my ipod 8gig some how?
2010-01-18T01:40:00.000Z	FireCrotch	fission6	you can try using the Minimal CD image
2010-01-18T01:41:00.000Z	FireCrotch	fission6	You can do a network install. You'll need another computer running a PXE server and tftp server
2010-01-18T01:42:00.000Z	FireCrotch	fission6	the minimal iso will have you select what packages to install, you can just choose to install ubuntu-desktop, and it will download all the required packages
2010-01-18T01:46:00.000Z	FireCrotch	fission6	Yes, you can use unetbootin in windows
2010-01-18T01:48:00.000Z	fission6	FireCrotch	its asking me for which distrobution, and i dont have an option to choose minimal, should i just select 9.10 and then just select the minimal.iso?
2010-01-18T01:48:00.000Z	FireCrotch	fission6	Download the minimal iso from the ubuntu website
2010-01-18T01:49:00.000Z	FireCrotch	fission6	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
2010-01-18T01:50:00.000Z	FireCrotch	fission6	you don't have to choose a distribution at the top
2010-01-18T01:54:00.000Z	fission6	FireCrotch	ii am going to place the full ubuntu 9.10 on a 6gb partition is this enough
2010-01-18T01:54:00.000Z	FireCrotch	fission6	you should be all set to go, if unetbootin is done.  Just make sure that if the computer is a laptop, you're plugged into the network via a cable
2010-01-18T01:55:00.000Z	FireCrotch	fission6	6GB is enough for Ubuntu, yes
2010-01-18T02:15:00.000Z	FireCrotch	fission6	I believe you can convert a wubi installation to a regular installation, if you choose to go that route
2010-01-18T02:19:00.000Z	fission6	FireCrotch	http://lubi.sourceforge.net/lvpm.html is that what you mean by moving to a regular install?
2010-01-18T02:20:00.000Z	FireCrotch	fission6	precisely
2010-01-18T07:04:00.000Z	fission6	FireCrotch	are you around
