2005-11-26T10:45:00.000Z	Swedish_Chef		problem with hardware raid is that it's generally slower, and i'd have to get the exact same controller
2005-11-26T10:46:00.000Z	Swedish_Chef		not really
2005-11-26T10:46:00.000Z	Swedish_Chef		it's been faster in all cases i've used it
2005-11-26T10:47:00.000Z	Swedish_Chef		my nonscientific guess is that linux is smarter when it comes to dealing with data than the card
2005-11-26T10:48:00.000Z	Swedish_Chef		eh?
2005-11-26T10:48:00.000Z	Swedish_Chef		i don't remember, to be honest
2005-11-26T10:48:00.000Z	Swedish_Chef		my love for tinkering with computers has decreased drastically over the years
2005-11-26T10:48:00.000Z	Swedish_Chef		so much so that i'm waiting to buy the new apple powerbooks next year :(
2005-11-26T10:49:00.000Z	Swedish_Chef		i didn't blame linux drivers
2005-11-26T10:49:00.000Z	smo	Swedish_Chef	ditto
2005-11-26T11:00:00.000Z	smo	Swedish_Chef	.. I tried that for a while.  very educational.  I like being able to install ubuntu on clients machines, and be able to leave before 5pm
2005-11-26T11:13:00.000Z	smo	Swedish_Chef	even on your ipod?
2005-11-26T11:14:00.000Z	Swedish_Chef	smo	of course not
2005-11-26T11:14:00.000Z	Swedish_Chef	smo	oh, gtkpod these days
2005-11-26T11:33:00.000Z	Swedish_Chef	smo	i thought lame did everything...
2005-11-26T11:34:00.000Z	smo	Swedish_Chef	I hope not .. I've been piping flac files thru faad for far too long if it does
2005-11-26T12:35:00.000Z	smo	Swedish_Chef	have you tried as another user?  that'll quickly narrow down whether it's your config or the system's
2005-11-26T12:36:00.000Z	Swedish_Chef	smo	i take it i should add another user to try, then...
2005-11-26T12:38:00.000Z	Swedish_Chef	smo	okay, so it must be my configuration.
2005-11-26T12:39:00.000Z	smo	Swedish_Chef	I'm not sure how you'd best go about isolating the problem .. but atleast you know reinstalling and dpkg-reconfig aren't going to do anything for you, so save time there
