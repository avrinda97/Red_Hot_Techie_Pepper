2007-07-29T08:50:00.000Z	Ashfire908		can i put a non-64 bit video card into a 64 bit slot?
2007-07-29T08:50:00.000Z	Ashfire908		yes i know it's a stupid question
2007-07-29T08:50:00.000Z	dystopianray	Ashfire908	 a pci video card into a pci-x slot?
2007-07-29T08:51:00.000Z	dystopianray	Ashfire908	ok, so pci-x, I beleive it is backwards compatible
2007-07-29T08:52:00.000Z	dystopianray	Ashfire908	yes, they are pci-x slots
2007-07-29T08:52:00.000Z	dystopianray	Ashfire908	and as far as I'm aware, pci-x is backwards compatible with pci
2007-07-29T08:52:00.000Z	dystopianray	Ashfire908	pci-x is not the same as pci express btw
2007-07-29T08:53:00.000Z	dystopianray	Ashfire908	it should be like a normal pci slot, but with an additional connector bit
2007-07-29T08:53:00.000Z	dystopianray	Ashfire908	pci cards won't fill the whole slot
2007-07-29T08:54:00.000Z	dystopianray	Ashfire908	there is always that chance, even with 100% compatible hardware
2007-08-12T11:37:00.000Z	dystopianray	Ashfire908	yes
2007-08-12T11:37:00.000Z	Ashfire908	dystopianray	is there something special i have to do?
2007-08-12T11:37:00.000Z	dystopianray	Ashfire908	no, just install kde or gnome, or whatever else you want
2007-08-12T11:37:00.000Z	Ashfire908	dystopianray	so if i have gnome i can just install kde with gnome still installed?
2007-08-12T11:37:00.000Z	dystopianray	Ashfire908	of course
2007-08-12T11:37:00.000Z	dystopianray	Ashfire908	it's just another package, nothing special
2007-08-12T11:37:00.000Z	Ashfire908	dystopianray	ok, just want to make sure before i broke somthing.
2007-08-12T11:38:00.000Z	Ashfire908	dystopianray	do i select the gui with the session selector?
2007-08-12T11:39:00.000Z	dystopianray	Ashfire908	that's right
2007-09-23T11:24:00.000Z	dystopianray	Ashfire908	configure your routing table
2007-09-23T11:26:00.000Z	Ashfire908	dystopianray	i already knew that
