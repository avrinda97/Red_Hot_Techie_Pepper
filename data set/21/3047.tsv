2009-12-19T02:38:00.000Z	airtonix	neur0tic	i don;t think it is possible to make apt use multiple tcp threads
2009-12-19T02:39:00.000Z	neur0tic	airtonix	any kind of override ?  i dont care if its manual
2009-12-19T02:39:00.000Z	airtonix	neur0tic	short of creating your own apt-get ?
2009-12-19T02:40:00.000Z	airtonix	neur0tic	actually have a look at something called multiget
2009-12-19T02:40:00.000Z	neur0tic	airtonix	ok, multiget, i'lll look that up, but does it blend with the very nice gui synaptic package manager /
2009-12-19T02:40:00.000Z	airtonix	neur0tic	no idea
2009-12-19T02:47:00.000Z	airtonix	neur0tic	actually you'll still download one file at the same speed (i also notice synaptics does apt-get update in tcp multithread mode but apt-get install in single thread mode) what you mean is that by multi threading your downloads you'll spend less time downloading your list of files overall
2009-12-19T02:48:00.000Z	neur0tic	airtonix	Exactly !
2009-12-19T02:49:00.000Z	airtonix	neur0tic	there is a firefox plugin i used to use to do a similar thing that actually did increase download speeds for one file due to the way properly configured servers would respond to multipart downloads, its called "downthemall"
2009-12-19T02:49:00.000Z	neur0tic	airtonix	 i have that download manager , but then how do i integrate it with synaptic ? See thats the question, i want to make my upgradation faster.
2009-12-19T02:51:00.000Z	airtonix	neur0tic	my maximum downspeed is 2.4mbps and my ISP mirrors the entire ubuntu repo... so its only one node a way from me at my max speed and all software installs come down at max speed....never had a need to do such a thing.
2009-12-19T02:51:00.000Z	neur0tic	airtonix	ur lucky. where do u stay ?
2009-12-19T02:52:00.000Z	neur0tic	airtonix	my isp dosent know the 'L' of linux :P
2009-12-19T02:52:00.000Z	airtonix	neur0tic	have you had a look at the apt-fast script yet? seems to be what ou want (except that it probably won't work with synaptics)
2009-12-19T02:53:00.000Z	neur0tic	airtonix	i am taking a look, just that i was looking for a more 'native' way.. i mean, synaptics is a great package manager, it should be configurable
2009-12-19T02:57:00.000Z	neur0tic	airtonix	apt-fast seems, good, but will apt-get honour system proxy settings ?
2009-12-19T02:57:00.000Z	airtonix	neur0tic	i can;t remember ( ithink it does)
2009-12-19T02:57:00.000Z	neur0tic	airtonix	because it uses multiple apt-gets internally
2009-12-19T03:17:00.000Z	neur0tic	airtonix	hey apt-fast works ! I had to hack around a little, modify the script, but now it works like a charm ! Thanks for all the help
2009-12-19T03:18:00.000Z	neur0tic	airtonix	now , only if i could make the whole thing work with the synaptic package manager gui !
