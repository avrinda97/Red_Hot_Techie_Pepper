2010-05-08T00:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eveningsky	https://launchpad.net/~rzr/+archive/ppa   may have 64bit
2010-05-08T00:32:00.000Z	eveningsky	ActionParsnip	Thanks. Don't see anything there, though.
2010-05-25T11:47:00.000Z	eveningsky	ActionParsnip	No I mean that when there is a video playing it wants to be always on top. If I click another window, the other window becomes active, but totem stays in front of it so I can't see anything. I want it to keep playing but move to the background like any other window would.
2010-05-25T11:48:00.000Z	eveningsky	ActionParsnip	it's probably in the manpage too, but I haven't found it yet.
2010-05-25T11:49:00.000Z	eveningsky	ActionParsnip	I could have sworn I saw it in the preferences a couple of installs of Ubuntu Studio ago, but I don't see it there now.
2010-05-25T11:50:00.000Z	eveningsky	ActionParsnip	sweet. I found it in plugins.
2010-05-25T11:50:00.000Z	eveningsky	ActionParsnip	That's why I thought I saw it, because I was messing with plugins.
2010-05-25T11:51:00.000Z	eveningsky	ActionParsnip	:)
2010-05-25T11:53:00.000Z	eveningsky	ActionParsnip	That's one of the problems with running a geek operating systems. In a commercial OS, once the plugin was installed it would almost certainly appear in the obvious location of preferences.
2010-05-25T11:56:00.000Z	eveningsky	ActionParsnip	no it's a geek OS. I finally made the switch about 3 months ago, and if I wasn't a geek I would have given up on it after 2 weeks. The cool thing is you get to tweak everything. The problem is you MUST tweak nearly EVERYTHING.
2010-05-25T11:56:00.000Z	eveningsky	ActionParsnip	It's not geek on par with some other linux versions, but you still gotta be a geek to really love it.
2010-05-25T11:59:00.000Z	eveningsky	ActionParsnip	Well cool! That's pretty amazing, but notice he's gotta use ethernet to be able to use stock settings, already a tweak in the making. My grandmother is running on Win98 with a wireless card. Older, crappier system, but at least the wireless just works.
2010-05-25T12:01:00.000Z	eveningsky	ActionParsnip	I'm not here to lay blame. I agree.
2010-05-25T12:05:00.000Z	eveningsky	ActionParsnip	It's not just hardware though. Microsoft spends millions on market testing to see what kind of interface people want and still screw up a LOT. Gnome has to figure out what people want just from the feedback of those few of us nuts enough to use an operating system with crappy driver support.
2010-05-25T12:08:00.000Z	eveningsky	ActionParsnip	Flawlessly? If you open nautilus with list view, then change the width of the Name field, does it remember the new width the next time you open nautilus?
2010-05-25T12:09:00.000Z	eveningsky	ActionParsnip	See, that's another tweak.
2010-05-25T12:10:00.000Z	eveningsky	ActionParsnip	Do you expect your grandfather to use the terminal for everything?
2010-05-25T12:15:00.000Z	eveningsky	ActionParsnip	This should  probably be offtopic, no?
2010-05-25T12:18:00.000Z	eveningsky	ActionParsnip	Thank you. The help has been recieved. If you want to continue to argue if Ubuntu is a geeky OS, type my name into offtopic.
2010-05-25T12:19:00.000Z	eveningsky	ActionParsnip	too long.
