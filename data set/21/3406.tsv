2011-03-16T13:48:00.000Z	odix		anyone ever seen a program that emulates a dvd/cd drive on boot and can choose an iso from a media storage device for os boot installations
2011-03-16T13:49:00.000Z	odix		via no cd drive and no usb boot
2011-03-16T13:49:00.000Z	odix		is it possible ??
2011-03-16T13:49:00.000Z	odix		well i need it
2011-03-16T13:49:00.000Z	odix		haha
2011-03-16T13:50:00.000Z	odix		i assume it writes a boot sector partition with that emulation software on it
2011-03-16T13:50:00.000Z	odix		my dvd drive is burning coasteres
2011-03-16T13:50:00.000Z	odix		and i have no option to boot from usb, via my problem
2011-03-16T13:50:00.000Z	odix		and i want a nix flavor
2011-03-16T13:50:00.000Z	sacarlson	odix	you can use this method, I've used it to boot from my sdb hard disk http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1288604
2011-03-16T13:51:00.000Z	sacarlson	odix	I just add an entry in my grub to boot the iso
2011-03-16T13:52:00.000Z	sacarlson	odix	oh this only works if you have a bootable grub2 harddisk with any linux on it
2011-03-16T13:53:00.000Z	sacarlson	odix	but you can use a usbflash as that also points out
2011-03-16T14:11:00.000Z	sacarlson	odix	maybe install with wubi and use wubi install to install onto a real ext4 partitions
2011-03-16T14:13:00.000Z	sacarlson	odix	one of the problems I did have installing from a harddisk was that I couldn't partition from the same disk I was running from so make sure it creates a root partition in ramdisk whatever you do
2011-03-16T14:17:00.000Z	sacarlson	odix	I think they have tools for that like partitionmagic so I guess yes
2011-03-16T14:20:00.000Z	sacarlson	odix	you don't have a usb flash to boot from?  they do have windows programs to load them bootable
2011-03-16T14:22:00.000Z	odix	sacarlson	the comp wont boot from flash
2011-03-16T14:24:00.000Z	sacarlson	odix	there is a program call plop boot manager that runs in windows that will make any computer boot a usb
2011-03-16T14:24:00.000Z	sacarlson	odix	see http://www.plop.at/en/bootmanager.html
