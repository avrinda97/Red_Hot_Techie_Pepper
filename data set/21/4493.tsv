2011-05-05T13:19:00.000Z	Viking667		Right. I've been playing a bit with compiz and Unity, now I'm trying to figure something out. How do I change _desktops_?
2011-05-05T13:19:00.000Z	Viking667		I can change viewports on the one desktop, and I can throw programs onto other desktops, what I can't seem to do is to change what desktop I'm currently on.
