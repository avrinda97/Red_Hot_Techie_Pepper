2006-06-15T15:36:00.000Z	Ackeubu_		I need a user for samba. can i create a unix user without creating a home directory?
2006-06-15T15:36:00.000Z	LeaChim	Ackeubu_	a user for samba? you mean to login to your linux server from another machine?
2006-06-15T15:38:00.000Z	Ackeubu_	LeaChim	yeah
2006-06-15T15:38:00.000Z	LeaChim	Ackeubu_	samba users are seperate from normal unix users
2006-06-15T15:39:00.000Z	LeaChim	Ackeubu_	use smbpasswd -a username to add a samba user. i.e. you use that username and password to access the files you're sharing by samba
2006-06-15T15:39:00.000Z	LeaChim	Ackeubu_	as root btw :P
2006-06-15T15:40:00.000Z	Ackeubu_	LeaChim	yeah i have tried that but i get this error Failed to initialise SAM_ACCOUNT for user a. Does this user exist in the UNIX password database ?
2006-06-15T15:41:00.000Z	LeaChim	Ackeubu_	you have to use the same name as a unix user that already exists - i suggest you use your normal username for samba as well
2006-06-15T15:43:00.000Z	Ackeubu_	LeaChim	Then when i try to loggon i get this error message: 'session setup failed: NT_STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE'
2006-06-15T15:44:00.000Z	Ackeubu_	LeaChim	i tried to loggon using smbclient //192.168.0.X/username
2006-06-15T15:44:00.000Z	LeaChim	Ackeubu_	which computer are you trying to access using smbclient? your linux one?

2006-06-15T15:49:00.000Z	LeaChim	Ackeubu_	have you got a security= line in your smb.conf?
2006-06-15T15:50:00.000Z	LeaChim	Ackeubu_	try adding security = user if it isn't there, or it's commented. then restart samba
