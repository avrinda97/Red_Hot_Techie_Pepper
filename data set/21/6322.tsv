2007-07-21T10:16:00.000Z	JC_Denton_	Jack_Sparrow	yes I am sharing personal experiences.. others can deduct from it what they like... If I would recommend it I would inform others that problems caused by it are not uncommon
2007-07-21T10:16:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	JC_Denton_	It is not appropiate even in that context
2007-07-21T10:17:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	JC_Denton_	Automatix use is discouraged in this channel
2007-07-21T10:18:00.000Z	JC_Denton_	Jack_Sparrow	one can discuss various solutions just as distro's can choose to use closed s/w or create installers for closed s/w
2007-07-21T10:21:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	JC_Denton_	I am not going to debate this issue...  Every thime you bring up automatix.. expect others to respond..  Envy is another usless script.. I dont recommend any scripts.. If someone needs something we are happy to help them.
2007-07-21T10:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	JC_Denton_	To put you on ignore as a troll..
2007-07-21T10:23:00.000Z	JC_Denton_	Jack_Sparrow	first you recommend me not to use automatix only to call me a troll when I inquire about superior solutions....
