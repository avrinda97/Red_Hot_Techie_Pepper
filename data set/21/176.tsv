2012-06-30T17:53:00.000Z	NurseDad		can't connect to my wireless router. I get an authentication screen but but the connect button stays grayed out (know the password is correct) same machine (duel boot) connects easily when win 7 is running. Any help?

2012-06-30T17:56:00.000Z	NurseDad	ghostchick2013	yes i have done that and deleted and re done several times no joy
2012-06-30T17:57:00.000Z	ghostchick2013	NurseDad	 all the fields are correctly inserted in?
2012-06-30T17:58:00.000Z	NurseDad	ghostchick2013	i think so, i even saw a thread about inserting the routers mac address as the BSSID in IP v4 and that seemed to work for a time
2012-06-30T18:00:00.000Z	NurseDad	ghostchick2013	yes password correct. I was hoping the updates to kernal image i got this AM would fix but nope
2012-06-30T18:02:00.000Z	NurseDad	ghostchick2013	it is intermittent yesterday I had no problem connecting at home or at twwo other locations
2012-06-30T18:07:00.000Z	ghostchick2013	NurseDad	 another option is killing networkmanager

2012-06-30T18:10:00.000Z	NurseDad	ghostchick2013	will it run at next boot without me starting it?
