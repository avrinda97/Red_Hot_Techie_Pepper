2010-10-12T09:36:00.000Z	lsoderman		I want to completely reinstall ubuntu from CD or USB, but I think the exosting Debian boot loader is interfering with the install. I can't see the hd once I get to "Install". Any ideas on how to overwrite the existing Debian?
2010-10-12T09:37:00.000Z	Ken8521	lsoderman	thats very unlikely the debian install is doing that(or at least it never has for me)...
2010-10-12T09:37:00.000Z	Ken8521	lsoderman	if you boot the live CD, can you view the drive in Gparted?
2010-10-12T09:38:00.000Z	Ken8521	lsoderman	somehow i doubt highly debian has anything to do w/ that.
2010-10-12T09:39:00.000Z	lsoderman	Ken8521	- Could it be because the original partition is the entire drive?
2010-10-12T09:39:00.000Z	Ken8521	lsoderman	maybe burn and boot a parted magic CD?.. delete the debian partitions, then boot the ubuntu CD... problem is, if there's actually a problem w/ Ubuntu detecting your drive, your hosed at that point
2010-10-12T09:40:00.000Z	lsoderman	Ken8521	- don't mind wiping the drive, there's nothing on it of import.
2010-10-12T09:41:00.000Z	Ken8521	lsoderman	well, lif you don't mind, thats what i would try.. boot a Gparted or partedmagic live CD, format disk, then boot the ubuntu disk.. of course, really Gparted should see the drive under Ubuntu.. strange
2010-10-12T09:42:00.000Z	lsoderman	Ken8521	- yeah, it's confusing. Was thinking of going into Debian first and changing the partition first, to see if that changes things.
2010-10-12T09:42:00.000Z	lsoderman	Ken8521	- where can I get gparted? Will have to dl to laptop and burn disc
2010-10-12T09:42:00.000Z	Ken8521	lsoderman	like from a debian Live CD?... i doubt Debian is going to let you change a partition it's mounted on and using
2010-10-12T09:43:00.000Z	Ken8521	lsoderman	i always use parted magic.. the partition tool is Gparted but it has some more interesting tools than Gparted.. http://partedmagic.com/
2010-10-12T09:44:00.000Z	lsoderman	Ken8521	- sorry, don't know what I was thinking. I'll try partedmagic and see if I can fix it.
2010-10-12T09:45:00.000Z	Ken8521	lsoderman	and we are talking aout gparted on a Live CD, right?
2010-10-12T09:46:00.000Z	lsoderman	Ken8521	- yup - tried from both CD and USB. Both boot, but gparted doesn't see it, and there is no HDx entries in /dev
2010-10-12T09:46:00.000Z	Ken8521	lsoderman	that is just weird
2010-10-12T09:46:00.000Z	Ken8521	lsoderman	have you had ubuntu on that machine before... or is this machine extremely new or extremely old?
2010-10-12T09:47:00.000Z	lsoderman	Ken8521	- older machine, has debian, but this is the first ubuntu install
2010-10-12T09:48:00.000Z	Ken8521	lsoderman	hmm... seems really unlikely since debian is recognizing it... but i wonder if ubuntu just doesn't recognize whatever hard drive controller it's using?
2010-10-12T09:49:00.000Z	Ken8521	lsoderman	yeah, thats true.... didn't really think of that.. unelss the hard drive is plugged into a sata controller
2010-10-12T09:50:00.000Z	lsoderman	Ken8521	- nope. Same cable. They were originally set for M/S, but thought that might be a problem, so switched them both to C/S - no change.
