2010-03-10T06:30:00.000Z	rexha		Why when i want to install xubuntu the computer restarts ?
2010-03-10T06:32:00.000Z	Typos_King	rexha	  what do you mean?
2010-03-10T06:33:00.000Z	rexha	Typos_King	i put my cd and then it boots and loads then i hit enter to the Install Xubuntu after 2 seconds it restarts
2010-03-10T06:34:00.000Z	Typos_King	rexha	  retry, but before hitting, 'enter' to install, press F6 and turn on acpi=off and noapic, then press enter
2010-03-10T06:35:00.000Z	rexha	Typos_King	I will try that. Thank you.
2010-03-10T06:38:00.000Z	rexha	Typos_King	i tried noasci and asci=off but still not working, it reboots
2010-03-10T06:39:00.000Z	Typos_King	rexha	   check the cd for errors, or reburn the .iso if you have it, seems to  be a media error
2010-03-10T06:40:00.000Z	rexha	Typos_King	I have 3 cds and they all worked in other computers
2010-03-10T06:41:00.000Z	rexha	Typos_King	I just could install the command-line version
2010-03-10T06:44:00.000Z	Typos_King	rexha	   .. how about trying to use the usb startup disk?   boot with the cd on another machine that boots it, and usually, in the Menus there's a section for 'make usb startup disk', which just makes a live-usb bootable for install
2010-03-10T06:44:00.000Z	rexha	Typos_King	The USB boot isn't an option for me
2010-03-10T06:45:00.000Z	Typos_King	rexha	  you mean you're trying to install 9.1 on an 'older' machine?
2010-03-10T06:47:00.000Z	rexha	Typos_King	Yes an old one Pentium III but I didn't used it for 2 years and now I want to give it to a friend, It used to have XP
2010-03-10T06:47:00.000Z	Typos_King	rexha	  then is the cd, some older CD drives are picky on how the cd burned
2010-03-10T06:48:00.000Z	Typos_King	rexha	  I don't recall offhand.... but there's some older legacy way to burn cds to have them work on older cd drives
2010-03-10T06:49:00.000Z	Typos_King	rexha	   another way will be, take out the HD from it, stick on another machine, install it there, then put the HD back on the PIII hardware, it'll redetect and reconfigure
2010-03-10T06:52:00.000Z	rexha	Typos_King	Im using a new cd-rom to read the cd
2010-03-10T06:52:00.000Z	Typos_King	rexha	   a new cdrom on the PIII?
2010-03-10T06:54:00.000Z	rexha	Typos_King	yes.
2010-03-10T06:56:00.000Z	rexha	Typos_King	Im running the memory test now and see what it says.
2010-03-10T06:56:00.000Z	Typos_King	rexha	   check in the live-cd for any other boot options.. something... I know f6 has some, and I think f4 has more too
