2005-12-06T10:05:00.000Z	pundai		someoneeeeeeee has anyone noticed the mouse clicking when you drag with breezy
2005-12-06T10:06:00.000Z	mustard5	pundai	nope
2005-12-06T10:06:00.000Z	mustard5	pundai	heh
2005-12-06T10:07:00.000Z	pundai	mustard5	nooooooo not heh... annoying beyond windows
2005-12-06T10:07:00.000Z	mustard5	pundai	mine doesnt do that at all
2005-12-06T10:07:00.000Z	pundai	mustard5	obviously :(
2005-12-06T10:07:00.000Z	mustard5	pundai	what mouse you using?
2005-12-06T10:08:00.000Z	pundai	mustard5	the one on my laptop
2005-12-06T10:08:00.000Z	mustard5	pundai	bit of a mystery..I can't see anything in the options that would make that happen
2005-12-06T10:08:00.000Z	pundai	mustard5	ditto
2005-12-06T10:09:00.000Z	mustard5	pundai	check system preferences windows and see if that has something relevant
2005-12-06T10:10:00.000Z	pundai	mustard5	nothing :(
2005-12-06T10:10:00.000Z	mustard5	pundai	yeah I just tried the 'select window' option to see if that did it
2005-12-06T10:10:00.000Z	mustard5	pundai	can't recreate the problem
2005-12-06T10:10:00.000Z	pundai	mustard5	i think there mustve been changes in the mouse driver or something
2005-12-06T10:12:00.000Z	mustard5	pundai	I'm wondering whether you could reconfigure the mouse with sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver.xorg
2005-12-06T10:13:00.000Z	pundai	mustard5	i'll try that
2005-12-06T10:13:00.000Z	mustard5	pundai	there is a typo in that command btw
2005-12-06T10:13:00.000Z	mustard5	pundai	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2005-12-06T10:13:00.000Z	mustard5	pundai	choose defaults for questions you don't know the answer to
2005-12-06T10:36:00.000Z	mustard5	pundai	checking it now ;)
