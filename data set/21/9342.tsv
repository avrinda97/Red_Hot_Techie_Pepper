2005-12-25T17:38:00.000Z	scanwinder		ive got some dependency problems with apt which i cant seem to solve.......im trying to install gcc-4.0 and it says "Depends: gcc-4.0-base (= 4.0.1-4ubuntu9) but 4.0.2-5 is to be installer
2005-12-25T17:38:00.000Z	scanwinder		and also with cpp-4.0 it says it depends on it
2005-12-25T17:40:00.000Z	soundray	scanwinder	are you on dapper?
2005-12-25T17:42:00.000Z	scanwinder	soundray	wahts dapper
2005-12-25T17:43:00.000Z	soundray	scanwinder	it's the unstable version of Ubuntu. I'm asking because 4.0.2 should not be in the current stable version, which is Breezy.
2005-12-25T17:43:00.000Z	scanwinder	soundray	oh.....im in breezy
2005-12-25T17:43:00.000Z	scanwinder	soundray	well for some reason thats whats installed
2005-12-25T17:44:00.000Z	scanwinder	soundray	and just from breezy repositories.....i tried disabling all other repositories
2005-12-25T17:45:00.000Z	scanwinder	soundray	wait, i didnt re-install the packages....how do i get it to downgrade the package?
2005-12-25T17:45:00.000Z	soundray	scanwinder	with pinning, but I can't remember how you do it.
2005-12-25T17:46:00.000Z	soundray	scanwinder	check out the menu in Synaptic for ways to lock a particular version.
2005-12-25T17:51:00.000Z	soundray	scanwinder	read ubotu's message pls.
2005-12-25T17:51:00.000Z	scanwinder	soundray	ok thanks
2005-12-25T17:55:00.000Z	scanwinder	soundray	it seems that the stuff at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PinningHowto dosent stop it trying to remove all the packages dependencys
2005-12-25T17:56:00.000Z	soundray	scanwinder	can I give you another RTFM type source?
2005-12-25T17:56:00.000Z	scanwinder	soundray	yes

2005-12-25T17:58:00.000Z	soundray	scanwinder	I find this type of problem is difficult to solve on IRC. Do feel free to ask everyone again, though. You may yet find an expert.
2005-12-25T06:09:00.000Z	scanwinder	soundray	i got it sorted....i just had to install the older packages using dpkg
2005-12-25T06:09:00.000Z	soundray	scanwinder	I'm glad.
2005-12-25T06:09:00.000Z	scanwinder	soundray	thanks
