2009-03-06T15:02:00.000Z	Stylee	ActionParsnip2	thanks
2009-03-06T15:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip2	Stylee	it doesnt have hardware raid
2009-03-06T15:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip2	Stylee	it uses fakeraid
2009-03-06T15:03:00.000Z	Stylee	ActionParsnip2	you mean my MB?
2009-03-06T15:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip2	Stylee	yes, the SATA controllers can do rid type abilities (even though raid0 isnt raid) but the raid will need to be configured in the OS
2009-03-06T15:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip2	Stylee	ubuntu can set this up
2009-03-06T15:05:00.000Z	Stylee	ActionParsnip2	I see, thank you
2009-03-06T15:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip2	Stylee	if you had true raid you would boot to the raid bios and create a new array
2009-03-06T15:06:00.000Z	Stylee	ActionParsnip2	so I did
2009-03-06T15:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip2	Stylee	and linux would then only see 1 drive but the rest is handled by a controller rather than some garbage that motherboard manufactures bodge on
2009-03-06T15:08:00.000Z	Stylee	ActionParsnip2	so if linux doesn't recognize it as one drive, is a fake?
2009-03-06T15:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip2	Stylee	yep, you need to configure the raid in the live environment then install to that
2009-03-06T15:10:00.000Z	Stylee	ActionParsnip2	thank you :)
2009-03-06T17:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip2	Stylee	also try: sudo ifup eth0
2009-03-06T18:00:00.000Z	Stylee	ActionParsnip2	unknown interface wth0 :(
2009-03-06T18:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip2	Stylee	ok what interface names do you have in ifconfig
2009-03-06T18:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip2	Stylee	try: lshw -C network
2009-03-06T18:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip2	Stylee	is it enabled in bios? do you see data lights flashing on the back?
2009-03-06T18:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip2	Stylee	you could read:   dmesg | less to see whats going on
2009-03-06T18:07:00.000Z	Stylee	ActionParsnip2	so for lshw it says network disabled... and yes I see leds on back
