2006-06-03T16:19:00.000Z	CharlieSu		I just installed with the Desktop CD and am unable to get Updates..  I took screenshots during the entire process to show what is happening.  I do have an internet connection..  www.phunki.com/ubuntu for screenshots. Please Help
2006-06-03T16:20:00.000Z	Fujitsu	CharlieSu	looks like you have no network connection, or the server is down.
2006-06-03T16:21:00.000Z	CharlieSu	Fujitsu	i do have internet.. and the server isn't down.. if i type the path in firefox it works.. and downloads..  it is a problem with the update manager..
2006-06-03T16:21:00.000Z	Fujitsu	CharlieSu	odd.
2006-06-03T16:21:00.000Z	CharlieSu	Fujitsu	yes..  very..  plz keep looking...
2006-06-03T16:22:00.000Z	CharlieSu	Fujitsu	nope...  i am behind router..  but it works ...
2006-06-03T16:22:00.000Z	CharlieSu	Fujitsu	just a regular netgear router..  should that be a problem?
2006-06-03T16:22:00.000Z	Fujitsu	CharlieSu	I doubt it.
2006-06-03T16:22:00.000Z	CharlieSu	Fujitsu	i'm talking to you on the ubuntu install right now..
2006-06-03T16:23:00.000Z	CharlieSu	Fujitsu	what is weird is that it knows that there are updates..  it just is unable to get them..  strange ehh?
2006-06-03T16:23:00.000Z	Fujitsu	CharlieSu	aha. I take it you do have internet access.
2006-06-03T16:23:00.000Z	CharlieSu	Fujitsu	yes..  on internet now.
2006-06-03T16:24:00.000Z	CharlieSu	Fujitsu	what should I do?  any ideas?
2006-06-03T16:25:00.000Z	CharlieSu	Fujitsu	this is my third install..  i've downloaded CD twice..  and checked it...
2006-06-03T16:27:00.000Z	CharlieSu	Fujitsu	something is terribly wrong because the live CD is unable to download security updates aswell..  look at install-screenshot.png
2006-06-03T16:27:00.000Z	Fujitsu	CharlieSu	sounds like the US server is having issues, or your internet connection is stuffed...
2006-06-03T16:27:00.000Z	CharlieSu	Fujitsu	i've tried other servers..
2006-06-03T16:28:00.000Z	CharlieSu	Fujitsu	what is another server i can try?
2006-06-03T16:28:00.000Z	Fujitsu	CharlieSu	you sure your router's not blocking port 80?
2006-06-03T16:28:00.000Z	Fujitsu	CharlieSu	what gnomefreak said.
2006-06-03T16:30:00.000Z	Fujitsu	CharlieSu	ubotu is a bot!
