2008-06-13T20:54:00.000Z	Gin	JimmyP	can you see a wireless connection in iwconfig?
2008-06-13T20:55:00.000Z	Gin	JimmyP	then it is working :\
2008-06-13T20:56:00.000Z	Gin	JimmyP	what did you do to try to connect?
2008-06-13T20:56:00.000Z	Gin	JimmyP	what settings? where? be more exact please
2008-06-13T20:57:00.000Z	Gin	JimmyP	the icons on the top right corner?
2008-06-13T20:58:00.000Z	Gin	JimmyP	System -> Admin -> network   it is on the panel
2008-06-13T20:59:00.000Z	Gin	JimmyP	do you have a wireless connection there?
2008-06-13T21:00:00.000Z	Gin	JimmyP	okay, you have to unlock first before editing
2008-06-13T21:00:00.000Z	Gin	JimmyP	now, uncheck the roaming mode en put in your network details
2008-06-13T21:01:00.000Z	Gin	JimmyP	then okay to save the settings
2008-06-13T21:02:00.000Z	Gin	JimmyP	not always, some routers hide their essid so they won't be listed
2008-06-13T21:02:00.000Z	Gin	JimmyP	but for most ppl the network icon on the panel should work.
2008-06-13T21:03:00.000Z	Gin	JimmyP	but there are other utilities to scan for wireless networks, see gnomefiles.org
2008-06-13T21:05:00.000Z	Gin	JimmyP	g'luck.
2008-06-13T21:06:00.000Z	Gin	JimmyP	go back to that release
2008-06-13T21:07:00.000Z	Gin	JimmyP	did you try with a fresh install?
