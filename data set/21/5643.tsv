2008-12-21T23:46:00.000Z	angelica		hello, how can I know what sound card is installed in my pc?
2008-12-21T23:47:00.000Z	Ward1983	angelica	lspci | grep Audio
2008-12-21T23:48:00.000Z	angelica	Ward1983	do I type that in a terminal?
2008-12-21T23:48:00.000Z	Ward1983	angelica	yes
2008-12-21T23:49:00.000Z	Ward1983	angelica	with lshw like hischild suggested you can do it too (lshw | grep audio)
2008-12-21T23:50:00.000Z	angelica	Ward1983	do you know what can I do so my windows partition will recognize the sound card?
2008-12-21T23:50:00.000Z	Ward1983	angelica	that doesnt make any sense
2008-12-21T23:50:00.000Z	angelica	Ward1983	it says there are not sound devices, so I thought would be the sound card
2008-12-21T23:51:00.000Z	Ward1983	angelica	in windows you mean? :s
2008-12-21T23:51:00.000Z	angelica	Ward1983	yes
2008-12-21T23:51:00.000Z	Ward1983	angelica	ah so you booted ubuntu to see if it could find a soundcard?
2008-12-21T23:52:00.000Z	angelica	Ward1983	some one told me I would need drivers to install all that, but the only thing that is giving trouble is the sound thing so far
2008-12-21T23:52:00.000Z	angelica	Ward1983	yes, to see if somewhere in ubuntu I could know the info about my sound card
2008-12-21T23:52:00.000Z	Ward1983	angelica	ah so you just want to install the soundcard in windows? then i can recommend ##windows lol
2008-12-21T23:53:00.000Z	Ward1983	angelica	ah yes with the command i said
2008-12-21T23:53:00.000Z	angelica	Ward1983	ok, thanks!
2008-12-21T23:53:00.000Z	Ward1983	angelica	but grep Audio , not audio
2008-12-21T23:54:00.000Z	Ward1983	angelica	it should give you something like this: product: 82801H (ICH8 Family) HD Audio Controller
2008-12-21T23:54:00.000Z	Ward1983	angelica	goodluck
2008-12-21T23:55:00.000Z	angelica	Ward1983	like this?: product: VT8233/A/8235/8237 AC97 Audio Controller
2008-12-21T23:55:00.000Z	Ward1983	angelica	thats would be it yes
