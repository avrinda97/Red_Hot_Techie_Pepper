2007-10-20T10:09:00.000Z	ShakaGoldSaint		i'm trying to install gutsy from livecd, but it doesn't show my partitions, neither the installation program nor gparted, it only shows /dev/sda, no partitions
2007-10-20T10:09:00.000Z	ShakaGoldSaint		however
2007-10-20T10:10:00.000Z	ShakaGoldSaint		ls /dev | grep sda, shows my partitions
2007-10-20T10:10:00.000Z	nrdb	ShakaGoldSaint	tried fdisk ?
2007-10-20T10:10:00.000Z	ShakaGoldSaint	nrdb	you mean the fdisk tool for windows?

2007-10-20T10:11:00.000Z	ShakaGoldSaint	nrdb	what does that do? how can i use it?
2007-10-20T10:12:00.000Z	nrdb	ShakaGoldSaint	have you the LiveCD going ?
2007-10-20T10:12:00.000Z	ShakaGoldSaint	nrdb	yep, i'm using it right now
2007-10-20T10:13:00.000Z	nrdb	ShakaGoldSaint	just checking, do you know what device your HDD is ?
2007-10-20T10:14:00.000Z	ShakaGoldSaint	nrdb	/dev/sda ?
2007-10-20T10:15:00.000Z	nrdb	ShakaGoldSaint	in a terminal, the command would be "sudo fdisk /dev/sda"
2007-10-20T10:15:00.000Z	nrdb	ShakaGoldSaint	is this a new drive ?
2007-10-20T10:16:00.000Z	ShakaGoldSaint	nrdb	nope
2007-10-20T10:16:00.000Z	ShakaGoldSaint	nrdb	i had feisty + windows xp before
2007-10-20T10:17:00.000Z	ShakaGoldSaint	nrdb	this doesn't happen when i use the feisty livecd
2007-10-20T10:18:00.000Z	nrdb	ShakaGoldSaint	oh, I don't know what is going on, does fdisk find the partition data ?
2007-10-20T10:26:00.000Z	ShakaGoldSaint	nrdb	i can even manually mount a partition :S
2007-10-20T10:27:00.000Z	nrdb	ShakaGoldSaint	don't know whats wrong.
2007-10-20T10:27:00.000Z	ShakaGoldSaint	nrdb	that makes two of us, thanks for the help
2007-10-20T10:28:00.000Z	nrdb	ShakaGoldSaint	I have heard that windows can screw the partition table, if a small partition is used for windows.
