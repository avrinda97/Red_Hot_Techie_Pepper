2005-01-04T10:36:00.000Z	anir		yes i have.. i have been working in C for 4 years...but not in linux
2005-01-04T10:38:00.000Z	JDahl	anir	I dont mean to be patronizing, but there's probably 100s of online tutorials that cover Gnu software tools... googling wouldnt hurt
2005-01-04T10:38:00.000Z	anir		yes jdahl i should google a bit
2005-01-04T10:39:00.000Z	anir		ibm
2005-01-04T10:40:00.000Z	JDahl	anir	you're new to software dvlp on Linux? (I smell a fat chance of converting another Emacs follower)
2005-01-04T10:40:00.000Z	anir		bob2??
2005-01-04T10:41:00.000Z	anir		jdahl: yes i am new .. just a week old here
2005-01-04T10:41:00.000Z	anir		IBM computers??
2005-01-04T10:43:00.000Z	JDahl	anir	then you ought to experiement with Emacs (if you dont already know it)... you're probably used to IDEs with all sorts of bells and whistles - emacs has all that, but in a nonintrusive way
2005-01-04T10:44:00.000Z	anir	JDahl	how can i get it?
2005-01-04T10:45:00.000Z	JDahl	anir	by the wonders of apt-get... but this is becoming off-topic, we should take it to, e.g.,#ubuntuforums if you have more questions
2005-01-04T10:47:00.000Z	anir	JDahl	i would love to join u
