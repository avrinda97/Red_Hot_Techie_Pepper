2009-11-25T16:19:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	dijmen	if you need "Advanced" help, kidnap a ubuntu-dev.
2009-11-25T16:20:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	dijmen	if you need "Advanced" help, kidnap a ubuntu-dev. There isn't any On-call support crew. Well, not like windows has.
2009-11-25T16:20:00.000Z	dijmen	SpaceGhostC2C	thank you
2009-11-25T16:21:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	dijmen	now that we have that cleared up, what do you need help with?
2009-11-25T16:22:00.000Z	dijmen	SpaceGhostC2C	are vga/gfxpayload supposed to not work under vbox?
2009-11-25T16:22:00.000Z	dijmen	SpaceGhostC2C	this was my question
2009-11-25T16:27:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	dijmen	It's perfectly fine to have a lot of users in a channel. If you're needing some private help, ask someone to PM you.
2009-11-25T16:29:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	dijmen	that isn't an official channel, feel free to go there. I'm gonna stay here.
2009-11-25T16:30:00.000Z	dijmen	SpaceGhostC2C	freenode doesn't allow me to moderate it, so this means it's reserved for ubuntu
2009-11-25T16:30:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	dijmen	don't tell other users to join a different channel if you don't know what you're talking about.
2009-11-25T16:30:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	dijmen	if you read the topic, this is what it's for. Do you have any questions?
2009-11-25T16:31:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	dijmen	Official Ubuntu Support Channel https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IrcGuidelines
2009-11-25T16:32:00.000Z	dijmen	SpaceGhostC2C	I'm not allowed to reply to what you just said. bazhang is planning to ban me. please visit #ubuntu-offtopic.
2009-11-25T16:32:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	dijmen	in short, no. Long story: no, do you have any support related questions?
2009-11-25T16:39:00.000Z	dijmen	SpaceGhostC2C	yeah, got quite a few
2009-11-25T17:47:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	dijmen	you're quite the troll. But to answer the question you can make anything shiny in ubuntu.
2009-11-25T17:48:00.000Z	dijmen	SpaceGhostC2C	it's not trolling. just because, say, kde is AWESOME doesn't mean kubuntu doesn't suck hard
2009-11-25T17:48:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	dijmen	yes, but badgering is trolling.
2009-11-25T17:48:00.000Z	dijmen	SpaceGhostC2C	this is the purpose of my lxde vs lubuntu question
2009-11-25T17:49:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	dijmen	LXDE + ubuntu is Lubuntu/
