2008-01-09T10:18:00.000Z	xLE		can you do more than 1 sudo thing at a time?
2008-01-09T10:18:00.000Z	nickrud	xLE	sudo only works on the immediately following command
2008-01-09T10:20:00.000Z	nickrud	xLE	no, you can only have one apt action going at a time. Nothing to do with sudo, though
2008-01-09T10:20:00.000Z	nickrud	xLE	butyou can have more than one package by:  sudo apt-get install package1 package2 ....
2008-01-16T08:39:00.000Z	nickrud	xLE	did you install sun-java6-plugin ?
2008-01-16T08:40:00.000Z	nickrud	xLE	does it work at sun's plugin test page?
2008-01-16T08:41:00.000Z	xLE	nickrud	i also installed some "gcjwebsomething" i'll remove it.. how do you remove it?
2008-01-16T08:41:00.000Z	nickrud	xLE	yes, or search for it in synaptic if you can't remember the exact name
2008-01-16T08:49:00.000Z	nickrud	xLE	ps -A | grep dpkg , do you see it running?
2008-01-16T08:51:00.000Z	xLE	nickrud	it returns nothing
2008-01-16T08:51:00.000Z	nickrud	xLE	then a hack would be removing /var/lib/dpkg/lock
2008-01-16T08:52:00.000Z	nickrud	xLE	a way that works, but is not elegant
2008-01-16T09:12:00.000Z	nickrud	xLE	did you do the sudo update-alternatives --config java , and choose sun?
2008-01-16T09:13:00.000Z	nickrud	xLE	that's why I was smacking my head, it's the right fix :)
2008-01-16T09:14:00.000Z	xLE	nickrud	it still doesn't work.. still says "Click here to download plugin"
2008-01-16T09:15:00.000Z	nickrud	xLE	you sure you chose sun?
2008-01-16T09:15:00.000Z	xLE	nickrud	positive.
2008-01-16T09:19:00.000Z	xLE	nickrud	"Using `/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre/bin/java' to provide `java'."
2008-01-16T09:19:00.000Z	nickrud	xLE	hm, a sec I want to look at som links
2008-01-16T09:21:00.000Z	nickrud	xLE	I forgot, I'm running 64bit so I don't have the java plugin set up as ubuntu does ....
2008-01-16T09:23:00.000Z	nickrud	xLE	just shows how well the 64bit is running these days, that I could forget :)
