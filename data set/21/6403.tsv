2007-04-11T06:35:00.000Z	Selenolupus	jrib	Doesn't show as being available for me =/
2007-04-11T06:35:00.000Z	jrib	Selenolupus	multiverse isn't enabled by default, you need to enable it
2007-04-11T06:36:00.000Z	Selenolupus	jrib	I have multiverse enabled. :-P
2007-04-11T06:36:00.000Z	jrib	Selenolupus	pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list
2007-04-11T06:37:00.000Z	Selenolupus	jrib	Is there a way to select all of the text of the file in a CLi-environment?
2007-04-11T06:38:00.000Z	jrib	Selenolupus	just open it in gedit:  gedit /etc/apt/sources.list  .  Or are you not in X at all?
2007-04-11T06:38:00.000Z	Selenolupus	jrib	No X.
2007-04-11T06:38:00.000Z	jrib	Selenolupus	you can't really pastebin anyway then :)  one sec
