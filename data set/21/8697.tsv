2006-03-10T09:50:00.000Z	globe		can somebody help me get my xserver working on a laptop....
2006-03-10T09:51:00.000Z	Frogzoo	globe	which vid card?
2006-03-10T09:51:00.000Z	globe	Frogzoo	intel 855
2006-03-10T09:52:00.000Z	Frogzoo	globe	try that, or maybe google for other's who've done same
2006-03-10T09:52:00.000Z	globe	Frogzoo	yep.  I have done that...I cant easily google, as its not very lynx friendly
2006-03-10T09:54:00.000Z	Frogzoo	globe	anyhows, you might need to add lines for VertRefresh & HorizSync
2006-03-10T09:55:00.000Z	globe	Frogzoo	wouldnt surprize me, I had to about 6 months ago too.  I just dont remember the syntax.
2006-03-10T09:57:00.000Z	globe	Frogzoo	do I put that in the monitor section or the screen section?
2006-03-10T09:57:00.000Z	Frogzoo	globe	monitor section - yes
2006-03-10T09:58:00.000Z	globe	Frogzoo	can you possibly post your xorg.conf file on paste? I can read that wtih lynx
2006-03-10T10:00:00.000Z	Frogzoo	globe	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/9757
2007-06-15T08:25:00.000Z	Frogzoo	globe	the sata drives are now using the scsi driver, a bit confusing /dev/sda
2007-06-15T08:26:00.000Z	Frogzoo	globe	blkid
2007-06-15T08:27:00.000Z	Frogzoo	globe	maybe your partitions don't have uuid's yet?
2007-06-15T08:27:00.000Z	globe	Frogzoo	Sorry, but what is a blkid? block id?
2007-06-15T08:27:00.000Z	Frogzoo	globe	it's a command, shows your uuid's
2007-06-15T08:28:00.000Z	globe	Frogzoo	blkid gives nothing
2007-06-15T08:29:00.000Z	Frogzoo	globe	your partitions don't have uuid's then - blkid -U random /dev/sda# to set them
2007-06-15T08:30:00.000Z	globe	Frogzoo	.... okay, but why do my partitions need uuids? and, more importantly (to me) why are my IDE drives listed as sdXs?
2007-06-15T08:31:00.000Z	Frogzoo	globe	you don't need uuids, and feisty addresses ide drives with scsi driver, so sdX - it's a tad confusing
2007-06-15T08:34:00.000Z	globe	Frogzoo	mc44: thx.
