2007-12-20T10:35:00.000Z	nickrud	maddash	you are showing your history there :)
2007-12-20T10:36:00.000Z	maddash	nickrud	what?
2007-12-20T10:36:00.000Z	nickrud	maddash	x-window-manager , sadly many of those alternatives aren't being used well
2007-12-20T10:40:00.000Z	maddash	nickrud	I was referring to the bot
2007-12-20T10:40:00.000Z	nickrud	maddash	does that one run here? I didn't know that
2007-12-20T11:00:00.000Z	nickrud	maddash	oh, thats nice
2007-12-20T11:01:00.000Z	maddash	nickrud	if you paid attention, you'd see that his problem lies in not knowing his root pwd.
2007-12-20T11:01:00.000Z	nickrud	maddash	if he did a standard install, he never had the option
2007-12-20T11:02:00.000Z	maddash	nickrud	the ubuntu installer doesn't ask to set the root password??
2007-12-20T11:02:00.000Z	nickrud	maddash	nope :)
2007-12-20T11:03:00.000Z	nickrud	maddash	it's set to a hash that cannot be matched by any keystroke combo
2007-12-20T11:09:00.000Z	maddash	nickrud	'sudo -i'? canonical in place of what?
2007-12-20T11:10:00.000Z	nickrud	maddash	rather than having people set a root password
2007-12-20T11:10:00.000Z	maddash	nickrud	if you think about it, sudo isn't more secure than su
2007-12-20T11:11:00.000Z	maddash	nickrud	in fact, sudo is a potential security hole.
2007-12-20T11:11:00.000Z	maddash	nickrud	interesting, though. I didn't know about -i.
2007-12-20T11:11:00.000Z	nickrud	maddash	like I said, I'm agnostic. I used sudo in debian long before I heard of ubuntu to protect myself from repeating a really stupid error I once made. I've heard it said that if root has no password, a brute forcer needs to know a username as well as forcing a password
2007-12-20T11:12:00.000Z	maddash	nickrud	how hard is it to 'cat /etc/passwd'?
2007-12-20T11:12:00.000Z	nickrud	maddash	:)
2007-12-20T11:20:00.000Z	nickrud	maddash	that is a great list, I hadn't even heard of most of them. Thanks for the link
2007-12-20T11:31:00.000Z	maddash	nickrud	fdisk, man. **fdisk**
