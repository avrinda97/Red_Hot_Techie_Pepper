2005-03-12T17:18:00.000Z	WW		Does Ubuntu use "devfs"?  I'm installing openvpn, and the installer want to know if I want to create a TUN/TAP device.  It says I should refuse if I am using devfs.
2005-03-12T17:20:00.000Z	WW		Does that answer the question about using "devfs"?
2005-03-12T17:20:00.000Z	WW		:)
2005-03-12T06:57:00.000Z	WW		Hello, world.
2005-03-12T06:57:00.000Z	WW		I'm mucking around with openvpn, and I don't really know what I'm doing.
2005-03-12T06:58:00.000Z	WW		Once I have openvpn running, how do I use it?
2005-03-12T06:59:00.000Z	WW		How would I login in to my office computer on the remote network if I am connected to a vpn server?
2005-03-12T06:59:00.000Z	sic	WW	the ports would need to be open by whoever set up the vpn
2005-03-12T07:00:00.000Z	WW	sic	...and?
2005-03-12T07:01:00.000Z	sic	WW	use your favorite ssh client or vnc to connect
2005-03-12T07:01:00.000Z	WW	sic	Sorry, I really don't know much about how vpn works.  All I know now is that I was told that ssh has been disabled, and I have to use vpn.
2005-03-12T07:02:00.000Z	WW	sic	jdub: OK, I'll check out vnc.
2005-03-12T07:02:00.000Z	sic	WW	did your network admin tell you what vpn client to use?
2005-03-12T07:03:00.000Z	WW	sic	All I have so far is the ip address.  When I said my home computer runs linux, the tech guy that said, basically, "Oh. Sorry, I can't help you"
2005-03-12T07:04:00.000Z	sic	WW	oooo...are you good at vpn tunnelling?
2005-03-12T07:04:00.000Z	WW	sic	I'm as good at that as I am at brain surgery.
2005-03-12T07:04:00.000Z	sic	WW	I gave up trying to hit our VPN with my linux box...I just use my windows box..its easier
2005-03-12T07:04:00.000Z	WW	sic	Hmm...  I don't have a windows box.
2005-03-12T07:05:00.000Z	sic	WW	the box you have to connect to at work a windows box?
2005-03-12T07:06:00.000Z	WW	sic	Both my home computer and the computer that I ultimately want to connect to are linux.  Presumably the vpn server that I have to go through is windows.
2005-03-12T07:07:00.000Z	WW	sic	Don't forget, I may have a completely incorrect picture of how this is supposed to work.
