2009-02-11T06:07:00.000Z	Newb		Well, I did an install and my updates won't install

2009-02-11T06:08:00.000Z	Newb		When I enter the command it says I need to be super user
2009-02-11T06:08:00.000Z	Newb		Install flash
2009-02-11T06:08:00.000Z	Newb		I can't update
2009-02-11T06:08:00.000Z	Newb		Yes
2009-02-11T06:08:00.000Z	Newb		Type it into a shell?
2009-02-11T06:08:00.000Z	redvamp128	Newb	 you need to enable restricted before you can install flash-- it is in mediabuntu
2009-02-11T06:10:00.000Z	redvamp128	Newb	 then close-- let it do its thing --then open up synaptic package manger-- then you should see flash listed
2009-02-11T06:12:00.000Z	redvamp128	Newb	 then after it closes-- open up synaptic package manger
2009-02-11T06:12:00.000Z	redvamp128	Newb	 you should see the following-- Flashplugin-nonfree
2009-02-11T06:14:00.000Z	redvamp128	Newb	 applications- accessories -- terminal
2009-02-11T06:41:00.000Z	redvamp128	Newb	 you can install myth-desktop it is in synaptic-- and is a window manger-
2009-02-11T06:41:00.000Z	redvamp128	Newb	 I would have to research the Dazzle part but that is mythtv (mythbuntu)
2009-02-11T06:43:00.000Z	redvamp128	Newb	 | Mythbuntu <http://mythbuntu.org/>   -- in the synaptic package manager it is - mythbuntu-desktop
2009-02-11T06:44:00.000Z	redvamp128	Newb	 personally I like -- Virtual Box not the Ose (the sun version) it has better guest additions.
2009-02-11T06:45:00.000Z	redvamp128	Newb	 Look at the bottom of the page-- Linux_Downloads - VirtualBox <http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads>
2009-02-11T06:45:00.000Z	redvamp128	Newb	 I would also suggest-- installing Dkms in addition to the Virtual Box.... it will make kernel updates easier without having to reconfigure virtual box each time.
