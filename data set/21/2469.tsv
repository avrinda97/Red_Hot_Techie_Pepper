2010-08-01T01:53:00.000Z	d9500	lathan	does your computer see the persistent-SD card as simply another /dev/sdX device?
2010-08-01T01:58:00.000Z	lathan		so, can anyone tell me what I would need to do in this situation? I have a 2 GB SD card with a Live-Persistent version of Ubuntu Netbook Remix 10.04 on it. Now, I want to install this on my internal HDD, but I want to transfer all the stuff from my SD version to the full install (as i've installed programs, made changes to the OS, etc.). I would just copy the SD to the HDD completely, but the SD is a "live" version. any ideas anyone?
2010-08-01T02:00:00.000Z	lathan		there's no way to avoid reinstalling everything?
2010-08-01T02:00:00.000Z	d9500	lathan	see my earlier message. if the machine sees it as another standard disk drive (that is, a /dev/sdX device) then you may be able to clone it.
2010-08-01T02:01:00.000Z	lathan		yeah, someone mentioned !clone, but i don't know what that means
2010-08-01T02:01:00.000Z	d9500	lathan	are you in the live-persistent sd session now?
2010-08-01T02:01:00.000Z	lathan		i am
2010-08-01T02:01:00.000Z	lathan		i'm booting up gparted right now
2010-08-01T02:02:00.000Z	lathan		my internal HDD is sda and my live-persistent sd is sdc
2010-08-01T02:03:00.000Z	d9500		ok, then the machine sees it as a /dev/sdX device, so you're good. you should, I think (never tried it) be able to use clonezilla in disk-to disk mode to clone the SD t a hard drive.
2010-08-01T02:03:00.000Z	lathan		would that make the HDD version a live install though? and not a full-install?
2010-08-01T02:04:00.000Z	d9500	lathan	is the drive itself a live-only? or totally persistent, so that if you install in app when running ubuntu off the SD, then reboot, the app is still there?
2010-08-01T02:05:00.000Z	lathan		yes, it is persistent, that is, if i install something, it is still on my SD when i reboot. however, when ubuntu starts up i still click "test ubuntu" and i want to avoid this with a full install
2010-08-01T02:05:00.000Z	lathan		but at the same time, i want to keep the changes I made to my SD when I install UNR fully to my HDD
2010-08-01T02:08:00.000Z	lathan		where did my helper go? :-p
2010-08-01T02:08:00.000Z	d9500	lathan	cloning will keep the changes, but i'm guessing that there's something on the persistent sd, some kind of script or program that runs at boot, that generates that "try ubuntu" screen, so clozing wouldn't remove it
2010-08-01T02:08:00.000Z	d9500		cloning*
2010-08-01T02:10:00.000Z	lathan		so, what's the difference between full install and live-persistent, aside from the prompt to try/install ubuntu? i tried to do a full install to the 2GB SD, but it said I needed 2.4 GB free and my SD is only 2GB, so somehow the live-persistent, is only 700MB allowing for 1.3 GB of persistence. What makes the full-install so much bigger?
2010-08-01T02:12:00.000Z	lathan		okay, so i guess i will just start over with a full install and just install things again as i need them
2010-08-01T02:13:00.000Z	lathan	Dr_Willis	yeah, my netbook HDD has a 4 GB partition, i will do a full install on that
2010-08-01T02:14:00.000Z	d9500	lathan	yes, what Dr_Willis said. That's not really a lot of space. You may also want to try something like Lubuntu (base ubuntu install but w/ LXDE instead of Gnome) which is a little smaller
