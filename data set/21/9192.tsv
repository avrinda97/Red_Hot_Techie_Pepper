2005-12-08T16:26:00.000Z	robotgeek		is there anyway i can have two interfaces online at a time? like both wireless and ethernet?
2005-12-08T16:27:00.000Z	Fujitsu	robotgeek	Yes.
2005-12-08T16:27:00.000Z	Fujitsu	robotgeek	What is stopping you?
2005-12-08T16:27:00.000Z	robotgeek	Fujitsu	i'll explain my scenario better
2005-12-08T16:28:00.000Z	robotgeek	Fujitsu	i have two laptops sitting next to each other, and i want connect the laptops thru the ethernet's and they are both online using wireless (separately)
2005-12-08T16:35:00.000Z	Fujitsu	robotgeek	what do you want to actually do with them?
2005-12-08T16:34:00.000Z	robotgeek	Fujitsu	any ideas on my issue?
2005-12-08T16:36:00.000Z	robotgeek	Fujitsu	well, there's this app called synergy (a poor man's kvm switch) , and i want make synergy use the ethernet, while i be online in both of them using the wireless
2005-12-08T16:38:00.000Z	robotgeek	Fujitsu	both laptops have wireless connections (i want them to use their own connections). i take a ethernet cable to connect both laptops to each other, and have to make synergy use that to communicate? doable?
2005-12-08T16:39:00.000Z	Fujitsu	robotgeek	it would require some nasty iptables work.
2005-12-08T16:40:00.000Z	robotgeek	Fujitsu	hmm, okay. any good guides lying around?
2005-12-08T16:41:00.000Z	robotgeek	Fujitsu	or should i just use ipkungfu or whatever?
2005-12-08T16:41:00.000Z	robotgeek	Fujitsu	some app to manage iptables, i hear of it here quite a lot :)
2005-12-08T16:43:00.000Z	Fujitsu	robotgeek	I know nothing about it.
2005-12-08T16:43:00.000Z	robotgeek	Fujitsu	btw, that app synergy is awesome. http://synergy2.sourceforge.net
2005-12-08T16:44:00.000Z	robotgeek	Fujitsu	apt-cache show ipkungfu
2005-12-08T16:46:00.000Z	Fujitsu	robotgeek	you need to use iptables to direct all traffic on whatever port synergy uses to the wired Ethernet, and everything else to the wireless...
2005-12-08T16:46:00.000Z	robotgeek	Fujitsu	hmm, and i can have both interfaces up without any problems? just assign random ip's?
2005-12-08T16:49:00.000Z	robotgeek	Fujitsu	nite, thanks
2005-12-10T17:31:00.000Z	robotgeek	Fujitsu	:)
2005-12-10T17:35:00.000Z	robotgeek	Fujitsu	lirc-modules-sources recommends either kernel-headers | kernel-source
