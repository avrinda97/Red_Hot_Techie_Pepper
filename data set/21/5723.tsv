2007-08-22T06:17:00.000Z	Lex`		Okay new updates: I actually installed ubuntu on my second hard drive, EXT2 filesystem. But Now when I load it up, I get VGA errors, X server won't start. I have an ATI x1800 Mobile video card. Any suggestions?
2007-08-22T06:17:00.000Z	daj0ker	Lex`	get a new video card.... :-\ as ati struggles in linux
2007-08-22T06:18:00.000Z	Lex`	daj0ker	That's very easy to say. Tell me where I can get MXM Type 3 mobile video cards
2007-08-22T06:19:00.000Z	Lex`	daj0ker	Ubuntu won't load at all, just the error message, then I CTRL+ALT+DEL to restart
2007-08-22T06:20:00.000Z	daj0ker	Lex`	boot up in recover mode, nano xorg.conf, and change it manually
2007-08-22T06:20:00.000Z	Lex`	daj0ker	Thanks, I will try that
2007-08-22T06:20:00.000Z	daj0ker	Lex`	yea, that's what i did
2007-08-22T06:23:00.000Z	daj0ker	Lex`	have you set up your default user yet?
2007-08-22T06:23:00.000Z	Lex`	daj0ker	Yeah, I set up a user
2007-08-22T06:39:00.000Z	Lex`	daj0ker	I tried "nano xorg.conf" but a blank window came up. I tried looking for the file but can't find it either :S
2007-08-22T06:41:00.000Z	daj0ker	Lex`	did you go to the correct directory?
2007-08-22T06:41:00.000Z	daj0ker	Lex`	xorg.conf is located in /etc/X11
2007-08-22T06:42:00.000Z	Lex`	daj0ker	I don't even know which
2007-08-22T06:42:00.000Z	Lex`	daj0ker	K i'll reboot and try again
2007-08-22T06:49:00.000Z	Lex`	daj0ker	Actually it was already set to "vesa"

2007-08-22T06:50:00.000Z	daj0ker	Lex`	check in private chat, it'll be easier to talk it out
2007-08-22T06:51:00.000Z	Lex`	daj0ker	I need to register my nick first
2007-08-22T06:51:00.000Z	daj0ker	Lex`	i don't think so...
