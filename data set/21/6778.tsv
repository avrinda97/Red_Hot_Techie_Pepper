2008-01-12T07:25:00.000Z	shoeunited		Hello, I seem to be having a network issue.  I'm using a linksys wireless card and netgear WRG54 for the net and the last two days on my road runner cable 16mbs connection I haven't been able to break 70k/s download speed, though my roommate who is sharing it and using vista has been getting excellent speeds when we test the connection on his machine.
2008-01-12T07:26:00.000Z	sp0ro1	shoeunited	Where is the wireless router located and what objects are within a 3ft radius of it?
2008-01-12T07:28:00.000Z	sp0ro1	shoeunited	hm, was going to suggest making sure it's 3ft away from any metal objects, but if it's right next to your box I don't think it would make a difference. What channel is the router using, what standard, and what type of key/encryption if any?
2008-01-12T07:30:00.000Z	sp0ro1	shoeunited	Guessing you made sure no other APs in your area are using channel 11 already since 6 is default. Are the antennas on both the AP and the NIC situated at a 90-degree vertical angle?
2008-01-12T07:30:00.000Z	shoeunited	sp0ro1	No, I don't think so, I didn't consider that.
2008-01-12T07:32:00.000Z	sp0ro1	shoeunited	Try that, it probably won't make a huge difference, but it will help signal strength. Especially if you roam around with a laptop or something.
2008-01-12T07:32:00.000Z	sp0ro1	shoeunited	As for your transfer rate, have you tried situating the router anywhere else in the room?
2008-01-12T07:33:00.000Z	shoeunited	sp0ro1	So this could be a situation of antennas at weird angles?  Also, I forgot to mention that yesterday, I that the router had dropped me but ubuntu wouldn't drop the netgear connection even though it was @ 0% I even went and grabbed a wired connection and it wouldn't let go.  I had to do a full restart to get it to dump.
2008-01-12T07:34:00.000Z	sp0ro1	shoeunited	Hm, that could be an authentication problem. Do you have MAC address restrictions set on your network or something?
2008-01-12T07:34:00.000Z	shoeunited	sp0ro1	No, I hadn't since it was reporting 84% when it was right next to the comp.  Since you mentioned metal interference, possibly that is creating noise and ruining my connection?
2008-01-12T07:35:00.000Z	shoeunited	sp0ro1	Not that I'm aware, though I did see an area in the router setup specifying a specific mac address.
2008-01-12T07:35:00.000Z	sp0ro1	shoeunited	If you're getting 84%, most likely not, but it could cause collisions and/or make your CSMA collision avoidance system queue your computer up and make you have longer wait times to process things.
2008-01-12T07:37:00.000Z	sp0ro1	shoeunited	But to be completely honest, I don't think any of that would slow down your transfer speed. It might just be a compatibility issue between the router and the NIC. I've seen it happen before between different vendor wireless products.
2008-01-12T07:38:00.000Z	shoeunited	sp0ro1	the thing is (ironically) that ubuntu had more or less been happy with this connection for the last two weeks. :/
2008-01-12T07:38:00.000Z	shoeunited	sp0ro1	In the last 48 hours it seems to have started difficulties.  I considered network things, but I haven't installed anything besides sdlmame in the last 2 days.
2008-01-12T07:39:00.000Z	sp0ro1	shoeunited	Yeah, but CSMA|CA doesn't knock you off your connection, it just pauses whatever you're doing until whatever other device(or interfering object) is finished doing what it's doing, then resumes.
2008-01-12T07:40:00.000Z	sp0ro1	shoeunited	Which could essentially could make your download speeds *LOOK* slower, when infact they are actually just stalled. If it is an interfering object though, it would clog your network and you wouldn't even be able to do anything. So I'm not sure if that is the problem at all.
2008-01-12T07:41:00.000Z	sp0ro1	shoeunited	Have you tried checking your network for IPs or dual MAC addresses? You could possibly have a leecher if your system is open.
2008-01-12T07:42:00.000Z	shoeunited	sp0ro1	I will try checking my MAC addy's and try moving the router though.  As well as checking the antennae.  I will give those a shot first before I ask for more help stabbing in the dark. lol ^_^  ty :)
2008-01-12T07:43:00.000Z	sp0ro1	shoeunited	Np, just work with the stuff you can try to change without completely altering the network first...although moving the router is essentially doing that I suppose. ;P
2008-01-12T07:46:00.000Z	sp0ro1	shoeunited	if none of that works, start looking into your NIC configurations and/or what you have changed since you have been getting slower speeds.
