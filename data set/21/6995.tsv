2010-07-25T07:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		a single quote is  i always think of as a 'more intense' quote :) vs
2010-07-25T07:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		the " which lets programs still interperate/change things in teh quotes.
2010-07-25T07:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		I had teh # right at least.
2010-07-25T07:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		Now WHY its \040  i never have figured out.
2010-07-25T07:14:00.000Z	randy_	Dr_Willis	thats because 040 is octal for the space in ASCII
2010-07-25T07:15:00.000Z	randy_	Dr_Willis	so, if you want to find a particular character that is not on you keyboard, you can just reference the ASCII table.
2010-11-15T15:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	randy_	PPA's are normally not mirrors. there could be  differnt ppa's I guess that have the same stuff.
2010-11-15T15:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	randy_	 what window?  try alt-tab?
2010-11-15T15:43:00.000Z	randy_	Dr_Willis	"what window?  try alt-tab?" ,what is?
2010-11-15T15:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	randy_	 perhaps your windw list applet has crashed/removed. perhaps reset the panels back to default.
2010-11-15T15:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	randy_	 the alt-tab keys on the keyboard.
2010-11-15T15:44:00.000Z	randy_	Dr_Willis	I don't want to switch my windows
2010-11-15T15:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	randy_	 that was for ravi__
2010-11-15T15:45:00.000Z	randy_	Dr_Willis	I know ,you type wrong nickname,so I reciver
2010-12-27T06:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	randy_	 you can set a new one.  But not recover the old.
2010-12-27T06:24:00.000Z	randy_	Dr_Willis	I know ,but how to come into recover mode,grub2 doesn't show menu
2010-12-27T06:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	randy_	 you can  boot a live cd, and chroot in, and use passwd (best way) , or edit the /etc/shadow or password files by hand. (not a good idea)
2010-12-27T06:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	randy_	 or edit the grub line and perhaps use the 'single' option,
2010-12-27T06:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	randy_	 and skip the livecd/chroot steps.
2010-12-27T06:28:00.000Z	randy_	Dr_Willis	thank you
