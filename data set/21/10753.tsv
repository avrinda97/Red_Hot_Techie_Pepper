2005-07-02T12:43:00.000Z	topyli	sugoruyo	there are local groups. there are also #ubuntu-xx channels on freenode on several locales
2005-07-02T12:44:00.000Z	sugoruyo	topyli	thanks but there's no -el channel
2005-07-02T12:45:00.000Z	topyli	sugoruyo	you have to found one :)
2005-07-02T12:45:00.000Z	sugoruyo	topyli	well i would if i was good enough with linux..
2005-07-02T12:46:00.000Z	sugoruyo	topyli	and also if the locals hanged out more on freenode
2005-07-02T12:46:00.000Z	sugoruyo	topyli	it's something to do with fonts i think
2005-07-02T12:46:00.000Z	topyli	sugoruyo	advertise your channel on local media and hopefully the gurus will come chat on it
2005-07-02T12:47:00.000Z	sugoruyo	topyli	local media don't give a dime about computers and especially linux'
2005-07-02T12:48:00.000Z	sugoruyo	topyli	i could try founding one with a friend from debian-dev on the local irc network though
2005-07-02T12:48:00.000Z	topyli	sugoruyo	perhaps the local debian community could even help :)
2005-07-02T12:48:00.000Z	sugoruyo	topyli	in the meantime i just need the ability to read/write greek in abiword/openoffice
2005-07-02T12:48:00.000Z	sugoruyo	topyli	i doubt that
2005-07-02T12:49:00.000Z	sugoruyo	topyli	they're mad at ubuntu
2005-07-02T12:51:00.000Z	topyli	sugoruyo	sometimes debianites don't like ubuntu that's true. it's not always true on the local level though
2005-07-02T12:52:00.000Z	sugoruyo	topyli	well it is particularly true on MY local level
2005-07-02T12:54:00.000Z	topyli	sugoruyo	you have the wrong tools
2005-07-02T13:05:00.000Z	topyli	sugoruyo	i menant you, not crimsun ^
2005-07-02T13:05:00.000Z	sugoruyo	topyli	i wasn't talking about the typing
2005-07-02T13:05:00.000Z	topyli	sugoruyo	you actually want to know. that's good
2005-07-02T13:06:00.000Z	sugoruyo	topyli	no big deal, it just started churning out thousands of lines with filenames & stuff
2005-07-02T13:38:00.000Z	topyli	sugoruyo	the onboard chip might add some confusion. it did for me
