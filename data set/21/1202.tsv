2011-03-29T03:09:00.000Z	tbruff13	drc	hello can you guys help me please
2011-03-29T03:27:00.000Z	drc	tbruff13	Sounds like a pretty sorry admin to me...and trying to diagnose the school problem at home is difficult at best
2011-03-29T03:27:00.000Z	tbruff13	drc	i live in louisiana or IT is the Suddenlink internet guy
2011-03-29T03:28:00.000Z	drc	tbruff13	What I'd do is get a friend (that can connect to the internet there) to go with you, have him/her connect here to #ubuntu, then try to log on and we can work from there
2011-03-29T03:30:00.000Z	tbruff13	drc	we cant access this network from school and rrasyrogenees_ i do use the network manager it does not work and drc, tried to understand the problem, but its like ouPAr school has 2 network because sometimes it asks me for wep and sometimes it asks me for W
2011-03-29T03:31:00.000Z	drc	tbruff13	You are not understanding what I said...
2011-03-29T03:32:00.000Z	tbruff13	drc	I am just lost okay i dont know what to do i cant really do much from school we are not allowed email or instant message
2011-03-29T03:33:00.000Z	drc	tbruff13	take a friend that can connect to the school net with you, have them come here to #ubuntu, and then YOU try to connect to the wireless net. You can talk to us and tell exactly what you see.  3rd hand diagnosis is not good
2011-03-29T03:33:00.000Z	drc	tbruff13	you mean no one can irc from sshool?  Then use the browser to connect to #ubuntu
2011-03-29T03:34:00.000Z	tbruff13	drc	I cant talk to you from school its blocked the website and all
2011-03-29T03:35:00.000Z	tbruff13	drc	all my computer does is it keeps trying to connect and then the network manager asks me for the password again and im in louisiana
2011-03-29T03:36:00.000Z	drc	tbruff13	Sorry, you have no clue what I'm trying to do to help, so some one else can try.
2011-03-29T03:37:00.000Z	tbruff13	drc	im sorry ok i really dont know what your trying to do and im telling you all i know is there anyway that the next time i connect ubuntu can keep a log of errors so i can come home and show them to you
2011-03-29T04:04:00.000Z	tbruff13	drc	are you there
