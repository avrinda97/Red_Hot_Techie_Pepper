2007-08-22T09:41:00.000Z	mdious	bulmer	 no I know it is a broadcom ;)
2007-08-22T09:42:00.000Z	bulmer	mdious	he said he had an acx thats a TI chip
2007-08-22T09:43:00.000Z	mdious	bulmer	 i know, I still thought I might be able to help, don't worry, I won't make that mistake again
2007-08-22T09:45:00.000Z	bulmer	mdious	sorry i came across wrongly...im just pointing out its tI and not broadcom
2007-08-22T09:45:00.000Z	mdious	bulmer	 no that's okay, it was stupid of me to think what worked for one thing might work with another, you did nto come across wrongly, sorry for being so rude
2007-08-22T09:46:00.000Z	bulmer	mdious	i dont know, maybe ndiswrapper would work too, i just happen to use the driver that came and modified later upon coming across that article i pasted
2007-08-22T09:46:00.000Z	mdious	bulmer	 I'm still using dapper drake :P
2007-08-22T09:47:00.000Z	bulmer	mdious	so am i..am using dapper, i prefer stability than bleeding edge
2007-08-22T09:48:00.000Z	mdious	bulmer	 I've been on isdn so getting new cd iso's has always been an issue...and I never wanted them in the mail (I know you can get them free)
2007-08-22T09:50:00.000Z	bulmer	mdious	just curious, do you guys that use ISDN still pay a pretty penny per kilobit like?
2007-08-22T09:51:00.000Z	mdious	bulmer	 no before moving I lived on a farm and there was a goverment plan for people who could not get broadband, I had unlimited downloads, 2 phone lines for around $90 per month.  Cheaper than what we use to pay with standard dialup
2007-08-22T09:53:00.000Z	bulmer	mdious	thanks for the info..ISDN really never took off here in california..were they have piloted the test ISDN services..it was too expensive paying per kilobyte
2007-08-22T09:53:00.000Z	mdious	bulmer	 I don't think it really took off here either, you either had dialup or adsl (in a city anyway)
2007-08-22T09:54:00.000Z	mdious	bulmer	 without the goverment plan for it, I think it is expensive and not worth it, but don't know for sure
2007-08-22T09:55:00.000Z	bulmer	mdious	i believe what killed ISDN here, is once people find out that without power no phone connections as compared to like analog lines.there is always -48 volts and can still call emergency
2007-08-22T09:56:00.000Z	mdious	bulmer	 yeah we had a separate line for internet and phone...
2007-08-22T09:57:00.000Z	bulmer	mdious	they dont use the 1B of the 2B+D as phone line and the other digital line (internet) ?
2007-08-22T09:58:00.000Z	mdious	bulmer	 I'm not sure in aus, I only learn all that stuff for your side of the world when doing the cisco exams...they don't really cover how it works in aus
2007-08-22T09:59:00.000Z	bulmer	mdious	ah okay...laters..
2007-08-22T09:59:00.000Z	mdious	bulmer	 cya
