2005-05-22T13:32:00.000Z	nubious		does anyone know if it's possible to install KDE into ubuntu without redloading the kubuntu distro?
2005-05-22T13:32:00.000Z	nubious		I run Hoary
2005-05-22T13:32:00.000Z	goofrider_	nubious	apt-ger install kunutu-desktop
2005-05-22T13:32:00.000Z	goofrider_	nubious	sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
2005-05-22T14:29:00.000Z	goofrider_	nubious	vnc is installed by default in Ubuntu
2005-05-22T14:29:00.000Z	goofrider_	nubious	apt-cache search vnc
2005-05-22T14:30:00.000Z	goofrider_	nubious	I'd recommend tightvnc, but it's a personal preference
2005-05-22T14:30:00.000Z	goofrider_	nubious	maybe u don't have universe enabled?
2005-05-22T14:30:00.000Z	goofrider_	nubious	use remote X
2005-05-22T14:30:00.000Z	goofrider_	nubious	VNC is sloooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow
2005-05-22T14:31:00.000Z	goofrider_	nubious	or u can usee freenx (it's in hoary backports)
2005-05-22T14:32:00.000Z	goofrider_	nubious	I found remote X faster. vnc use compressed bitmaps while X uses primitives
2005-05-22T14:33:00.000Z	goofrider_	nubious	on windows, get an X server for windows
2005-05-22T14:33:00.000Z	goofrider_	nubious	get realvnc or tightvnc client for windows
2005-05-22T14:34:00.000Z	goofrider_	nubious	I think u need to add universe to your sources.list, first of all
2005-05-22T14:35:00.000Z	goofrider_	nubious	because the other vnc servers are in universe
2005-05-22T16:47:00.000Z	goofrider_	nubious	there's an ntpasswd craker as well
2005-05-22T16:49:00.000Z	goofrider_	nubious	would it be a problem with XP's firewall?
2005-05-22T16:51:00.000Z	goofrider_	nubious	u can also try specialized live cd like Helix. It's a linux live cd for cracking, heuristics and forensics
2005-05-22T16:52:00.000Z	goofrider_	nubious	there are several live cds specialize for that. with tcpdump and nmap and all those other goodies as well
2005-05-22T16:53:00.000Z	goofrider_	nubious	boot the live cd in ANOTER vmware session  :P
