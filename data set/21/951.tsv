2011-05-04T01:07:00.000Z	samtate		Hi, is there any way to get playlists in the sound menu on 10.10 Maverick. I refuse to upgrade to 11.04 until the bugs have been sorted out in a few months
2011-05-04T01:08:00.000Z	samtate		Hi, is there any way to get playlists in the sound menu on 10.10 Maverick (maybe just using the natty soundmenu?). I dont want to upgrade to 11.04
2011-05-04T01:09:00.000Z	vish	samtate	the support landed on 11.04, there is no easy way and not sure if anyone has tried, but if you want you could try upgrading the indicator and banshee extension
2011-05-04T01:09:00.000Z	samtate	vish	how would I do that?
2011-05-04T01:10:00.000Z	vish	samtate	right, ;)  its not an easy way.. and no one might have tried it.. you'd have to figure it out yourself ;p[
2011-05-04T01:10:00.000Z	samtate	vish	are there packages or a ppa though?
2011-05-04T01:11:00.000Z	vish	samtate	no ppa, you;d have to download the natty packages and install in maverick.. should probably work since not much has changed from maverick Â» natty , atleast the GTK/GNOME part
2011-05-04T01:12:00.000Z	samtate	vish	so where are the packages? Any particular site?
2011-05-04T01:12:00.000Z	vish	samtate	on launchpad
2011-05-04T01:13:00.000Z	samtate	vish	There are no debs, so obviously I will have to compile
2011-05-04T01:13:00.000Z	samtate	vish	?
2011-05-04T01:13:00.000Z	vish	samtate	the natty debs should be available.. the ones that are installed for natty
2011-05-04T01:14:00.000Z	samtate	vish	i cant see any
2011-05-04T01:15:00.000Z	vish	samtate	as i said, that takes some work.. it *will* be there, search launchpad for the debs..
2011-05-04T01:17:00.000Z	samtate	vish	I assure you its not there - in deb form at least
2011-05-04T01:18:00.000Z	vish	samtate	the debs are definitely needed to install those packages in natty, so there is no possible way the debs are not present.. (nope, I aint gonna search for it) :)
2011-05-04T01:19:00.000Z	vish	samtate	but they are there.. ;)
2011-05-04T01:20:00.000Z	samtate	vish	Hey I found it ;)
2011-05-04T01:20:00.000Z	vish	samtate	neat! i told ya it will be there..  :)
2011-05-04T01:20:00.000Z	samtate	vish	Cheers :P
2011-05-04T01:21:00.000Z	samtate	vish	Now I have to get the dependencies D:. Not a difficult task, just a tedious one
