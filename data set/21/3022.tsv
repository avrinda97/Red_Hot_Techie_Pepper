2009-09-21T03:13:00.000Z	indicava		does anyone know if its possible to manage eth0 in network-manager (dhcp enabled) and eth0:1 in /etc/network/interfaces as a static ip ?
2009-09-21T03:14:00.000Z	indicava		how can I choose which nics network-manager tries to manage automatically?
2009-09-21T03:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	indicava	if the nic has an entry in interfaces NM will ignore it
2009-09-21T03:16:00.000Z	indicava	erUSUL	can I manage eth0 in NM and eth0:1 in interfaces file?
2009-09-21T03:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	indicava	that should be a really unsual config dunno if that is supported
2009-09-21T03:17:00.000Z	indicava	erUSUL	it is a messy setup, can I trouble you with it for a second, been trying for ages to get this to work
2009-09-21T03:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	indicava	ok;
2009-09-21T03:18:00.000Z	indicava	erUSUL	I have two computers hooked up to the same router, the router is connected to the internet, I want to computer A to access the internet through the router but have computer B access it through A.
2009-09-21T03:19:00.000Z	indicava	erUSUL	i already have a DHCP server setting comp. B with comp A's ip address as its def. GW
2009-09-21T03:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	indicava	why not configure everything with interfaces ?
2009-09-21T03:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	indicava	i.e do not use NM
2009-09-21T03:21:00.000Z	indicava	erUSUL	well the interface in c comp. A. is getting its IP from the router dynamically, but that can be changed if its a must.
2009-09-21T03:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	indicava	interfaces supports a dhcp configured interface
2009-09-21T03:22:00.000Z	indicava	erUSUL	true, but its a wifi connection and its so much more manageable through NM in the day to day
2009-09-21T03:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	indicava	ahhh that explains everything... but... how does comp b connects to comp a ?
2009-09-21T03:23:00.000Z	indicava	erUSUL	thrpough the router, comp. A has only one interface
2009-09-21T03:24:00.000Z	indicava	erUSUL	i ahve a classroom full of pc's that I don't want to access the internet unless my laptop is their router
2009-09-21T03:27:00.000Z	indicava	erUSUL	any thoughts?
2009-09-21T03:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	indicava	so both machne a and machine b (or b's) connect to the same router via wireless) but you want machine b traffic to be routed through machine a
2009-09-21T03:27:00.000Z	indicava	erUSUL	exactly..
2009-09-21T03:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	indicava	why not just make machines b default gw be machine a (instead of router) and configure machine a to route the traffic (do not ask me the configuration details though ;P)
