2009-01-11T05:33:00.000Z	Titan8990	raylu	with an empty xorg.conf file?
2009-01-11T05:34:00.000Z	raylu	Titan8990	the new X doesn't need an xorg.conf. and X has already loaded; that's how he logged in
2009-01-11T05:34:00.000Z	Titan8990	raylu	interesting, what does it use?
2009-01-11T05:34:00.000Z	raylu	Titan8990	lots of guessing :D
2009-03-10T10:38:00.000Z	raylu	Titan8990	http://paste.ubuntu.com/129104/
2009-03-10T10:40:00.000Z	raylu	Titan8990	by label, he means he changed the partition type in the partition table with fdisk
2009-03-10T10:41:00.000Z	raylu	Titan8990	booting windows xp. or mounting it, for now. he might have installed grub onto it (dev/sda1)
2009-03-10T10:45:00.000Z	raylu	Titan8990	the problem is sda1 used to be his windows partition (or so he claims) and is now marked as 'linux raid autodetect.' he has no raid setup, so it's not a grub issue
2009-03-10T10:46:00.000Z	Titan8990	raylu	the last pastebin I saw from him showed it as ntfs....
2009-03-10T10:46:00.000Z	raylu	Titan8990	that was after he changed the partition table :P
2009-03-10T10:52:00.000Z	Titan8990	raylu	doesn't he need to specify ssh with -e when not going to a rsync daemon?
2009-03-10T10:53:00.000Z	raylu	Titan8990	no?
2009-03-10T10:53:00.000Z	Titan8990	raylu	I will test
2009-03-10T10:55:00.000Z	Titan8990	raylu	checked, -e is not needed
2009-03-10T10:55:00.000Z	raylu	Titan8990	ok
2009-03-10T11:32:00.000Z	Titan8990	raylu	ftp is better in scenerios where speed > security
2009-03-10T12:02:00.000Z	raylu	Titan8990	he can play the video, though
2009-05-19T11:48:00.000Z	raylu	Titan8990	before that, ls -l output would be nice
2009-05-19T11:48:00.000Z	raylu	Titan8990	the trash folder is a backup of stuff you deleted; that in itself doesn't make much sense to me :D
2009-05-19T11:48:00.000Z	raylu	Titan8990	also, -A will show hidden without showing .. and .
2009-05-19T11:49:00.000Z	Titan8990	raylu	agreed hehe
