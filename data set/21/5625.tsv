2007-09-16T12:32:00.000Z	BleedingMoon	Chousuke	im searchin good c complier for linux, and how to install it
2007-09-16T12:32:00.000Z	Chousuke	BleedingMoon	sudo aptitude install build-essential
2007-09-16T12:33:00.000Z	Chousuke	BleedingMoon	installs gcc and some basic libraries
2007-09-16T12:33:00.000Z	Chousuke	BleedingMoon	and headers
2007-09-16T12:33:00.000Z	Chousuke	BleedingMoon	libc and kernel I think
2007-09-16T12:33:00.000Z	Chousuke	BleedingMoon	just the bare minimum needed to compile stuff.
2007-09-16T12:34:00.000Z	Chousuke	BleedingMoon	you need to install additional headers and libraries depending on the requirements of the apps you want to compile
2007-09-16T12:35:00.000Z	BleedingMoon	Chousuke	how im doing that?
2007-09-16T12:35:00.000Z	Chousuke	BleedingMoon	with aptitude
2007-09-16T12:36:00.000Z	Chousuke	BleedingMoon	well, you can install packages with aptitude
2007-09-16T12:36:00.000Z	Chousuke	BleedingMoon	read aptitude's manual page
2007-09-16T12:37:00.000Z	Chousuke	BleedingMoon	for example, if you wanted the headers for some libfoo that is in the repositories, the header package is usually called libfoo-dev. you would usually use "aptitude install libfoo-dev" to install it
2007-09-16T12:38:00.000Z	BleedingMoon	Chousuke	there is no complete compler like vc++?
2007-09-16T12:38:00.000Z	Chousuke	BleedingMoon	gcc is a complete compiler
2007-09-16T12:39:00.000Z	Chousuke	BleedingMoon	you just need headers to use libraries, just like with VC++
2007-09-16T12:39:00.000Z	BleedingMoon	Chousuke	how i download gcc?
2007-09-16T12:39:00.000Z	Chousuke	BleedingMoon	we already told you.
2007-09-16T13:02:00.000Z	BleedingMoon	Chousuke	Ignite: can u come to #ubuntu-programming
