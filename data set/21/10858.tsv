2004-12-30T16:59:00.000Z	ajmitch_	bluefoxicy	'more secure', such as?
2004-12-31T17:00:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	ajmitch_	 Such as https://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/JUSNAnalysis  https://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/ProactiveSecurity  https://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=4374
2004-12-31T17:00:00.000Z	ajmitch_	bluefoxicy	I just read some of those pages a few minutes ago :)
2004-12-31T17:01:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	ajmitch_	 There have been people working on security hardening Gentoo.  Those efforts are also being focused on Debian by another project.  They're also targetting Ubuntu
2004-12-31T17:01:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	ajmitch_	 I'm very interested in this stuff, so I've been watching them :)
2004-12-31T17:01:00.000Z	ajmitch_	bluefoxicy	I'm interested in selinux integration work
2004-12-31T17:02:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	ajmitch_	 I'm not really much interested in an enterprise-class SELinux policy, but I'm not opposed to it if it's done well enough that it doesn't put 5 more layers of visible cruft in front of the user
2004-12-31T17:03:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	ajmitch_	 I think if there is an SELinux policy, there should at least be an option to give sysadmin_t role automagically if you su or login to root; of course, strictly speaking, this may not be the best idea (I am not an access control expert though).  I'm very lazy though :)
2004-12-31T17:04:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	ajmitch_	 SE-X?
2004-12-31T17:05:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	ajmitch_	 interesting
2004-12-31T17:05:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	ajmitch_	 I'm fairly certain that the most painful is going to be getting PaX integrated :)
2004-12-31T17:07:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	ajmitch_	 easy enough to fix with chpax (or paxctl if they have PT_PAX_FLAGS in them; pipacs said he could wire up paxctl to clobber the PT_GNU_STACK marking and alter the ELF header to change it to PT_PAX_FLAGS, since PT_GNU_STACK is useless under PaX)
2004-12-31T17:08:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	ajmitch_	 the problem is that some things that break under PaX are outside ubuntu's main distribution.
2004-12-31T17:10:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	ajmitch_	 I actually wrote to the Kaffe list and told them how to do a JVM functional under full PaX :)
2004-12-31T17:12:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	ajmitch_	 I think the first concern is going to be SSP though, not PaX.  You read the USN analysis I did, right?  40% of bugs (NOT including kernel bugs) were buffer overflows
2004-12-31T17:16:00.000Z	ajmitch_	bluefoxicy	yes, I just watched on irc an online talk by a hardened debian developer
2004-12-31T17:20:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	ajmitch_	 yeah, trulux?
2004-12-31T17:23:00.000Z	ajmitch_	bluefoxicy	yep :)
2004-12-31T17:25:00.000Z	ajmitch_	bluefoxicy	I might end up helping out, at the moment I just use a bit of selinux stuff on debian sid
2005-10-23T07:45:00.000Z	ajmitch_	bluefoxicy	language, please :P
