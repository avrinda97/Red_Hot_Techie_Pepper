2008-09-02T03:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	Friendly_hazard	 thats the 'console' where you normally enter whatever commands you need to install the nvidia drivers..
2008-09-02T03:32:00.000Z	dr_willis	Friendly_hazard	 depends on the command.
2008-09-02T03:32:00.000Z	dr_willis	Friendly_hazard	 you did login first?
2008-09-02T03:33:00.000Z	dr_willis	Friendly_hazard	 if you are trying to manually install the nvidia drivers. you may want to try the 'envyng' tool.. but its best to use the normal drivers in the repos.
2008-09-02T03:34:00.000Z	Friendly_hazard	dr_willis	i did several times but it doesnt work
2008-09-02T03:34:00.000Z	dr_willis	Friendly_hazard	 i would boot back to X and try envyng then.. and pray... :)
2008-09-02T03:35:00.000Z	dr_willis	Friendly_hazard	 what video card do you have exactly?
2008-09-02T03:35:00.000Z	dr_willis	Friendly_hazard	 Hmm my 8800gtsxxx works with the nvidia-glx-new drivers
2008-09-02T03:36:00.000Z	dr_willis	Friendly_hazard	 all i had to do was 'sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-new nvidia-settings'
2008-09-02T03:36:00.000Z	dr_willis	Friendly_hazard	 well... vmware does NOT USE the nvidia drivers.. it emulates some standard video card.
2008-09-02T03:36:00.000Z	dr_willis	Friendly_hazard	 you install the vmware tools and thats it...
2008-09-02T03:37:00.000Z	dr_willis	Friendly_hazard	 there may be some other tweaks.. but you will not (yet?) get full 3d support for the card in vmware
2008-09-02T03:38:00.000Z	dr_willis	Friendly_hazard	 3d Games + vmware =  not a good option at this time. Ive heard that vmware is working on  geting vmware to use the 3d cards features. but i dont know how well  along that is at this time
2008-09-02T03:41:00.000Z	dr_willis	Friendly_hazard	 i would set up windows to 'share' the drive.  and let the vmwareubuntu acccess it as a samba share. that would be the safest way
2008-09-02T03:42:00.000Z	dr_willis	Friendly_hazard	 i think there may be another way to do it. with some sort of directory shareing feature of vmare but ive not done it that way
