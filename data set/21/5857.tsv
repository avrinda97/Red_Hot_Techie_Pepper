2007-07-21T14:34:00.000Z	mz--		hi.  for some reason, none of my accounts can use 'su' anymore.  I can log in via root and su to any user, but when logged in as a non-root user i cannot su to root (or any other user).  any ideas?
2007-07-21T14:35:00.000Z	bulmer	mz--	visudo and figure out the allowed users to sudo
2007-07-21T14:35:00.000Z	mz--	bulmer	listed as all
2007-07-21T14:35:00.000Z	mz--	bulmer	still doesn't mean anything why user nonadmin1 can't su to nonadmin2, either
2007-07-21T14:36:00.000Z	bulmer	mz--	which line entry?
2007-07-21T14:36:00.000Z	mz--	bulmer	hold, i need to juggle screens
2007-07-21T14:37:00.000Z	mz--	bulmer	: %admin ALL=(ALL) ALL
2007-07-21T14:37:00.000Z	mz--	bulmer	all my users are in admin by default.
2007-07-21T14:38:00.000Z	bulmer	mz--	and no one can sudo as root?
2007-07-21T14:38:00.000Z	mz--	bulmer	no one can sudo, no one can su (to either root, or to any non-root user either)
2007-07-21T14:39:00.000Z	mz--	bulmer	another symptom may be a fact that wpasupplicant does not start, nor do usbdrives and optical drives automount either.  don't know if those are connected.
2007-07-21T14:39:00.000Z	bulmer	mz--	and you used visudo to change that file right not like using a vim or emacs?
2007-07-21T14:39:00.000Z	mz--	bulmer	visudo, vi
2007-07-21T14:39:00.000Z	bulmer	mz--	dont use just vi  you must use visudo
2007-07-21T14:39:00.000Z	mz--	bulmer	i mean, i did use visudo.  i havent changed anything in the file
2007-07-21T14:40:00.000Z	bulmer	mz--	how did you su to another user?
2007-07-21T14:40:00.000Z	mz--	bulmer	either 'su -' to su to root, or 'su - otheruser'.
2007-07-21T14:40:00.000Z	bulmer	mz--	that sounds right..hmmm
2007-07-21T14:42:00.000Z	bulmer	mz--	can you ssh in to localhost  as the other user?
2007-07-21T14:42:00.000Z	mz--	bulmer	let me screen this and try.  bbiaf.
2007-07-21T14:43:00.000Z	mz--	bulmer	i can log in via ssh (and normal boot).
