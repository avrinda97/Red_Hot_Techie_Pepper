2011-03-12T07:19:00.000Z	bazhang	Polah	hi
2011-03-25T04:27:00.000Z	bazhang	Polah	I saw that
2011-04-03T04:23:00.000Z	Polah	bazhang	larious: You can go to http://archive.canonical.com and manually download the files for Sun Java 6, might take a while and you might miss a few.
2011-04-03T04:24:00.000Z	bazhang	Polah	and the license agreement?
2011-04-03T04:25:00.000Z	Polah	bazhang	Just do it the easy way and add the repo in Ubuntu and install it
2011-04-03T04:26:00.000Z	bazhang	Polah	am aware of that, you need ubuntu for the partner repos, in larious 's case
2011-04-03T04:26:00.000Z	Polah	bazhang	Oh yeah, sorry, I thought you were larious for a second.
2011-05-30T18:54:00.000Z	bazhang	Polah	best to reinstall, honestly
2011-05-30T18:55:00.000Z	bazhang	Polah	that PPA is unsupported and frankly breaks things
2011-05-30T18:56:00.000Z	bazhang	Polah	well good luck. ppa-purge I suppose but back up everything important and prepare for reinstallation
2011-05-30T18:56:00.000Z	Polah	bazhang	I have everything on a second drive already. I just don't want to reinstall as I'd have to install and reset all my settings and whatnot
2011-05-30T18:57:00.000Z	Polah	bazhang	Yeah, I'm just about to do it
2011-06-12T07:08:00.000Z	Polah	bazhang	Not directly to ethernet. Directly to the phone/fibre line
2011-08-27T05:43:00.000Z	Polah	bazhang	That's with 10.10 though
2011-09-04T03:03:00.000Z	bazhang	Polah	he wants kubuntu netbook remix now
2011-09-04T03:51:00.000Z	bazhang	Polah	tried the #winehq repos ?
2011-09-04T03:52:00.000Z	Polah	bazhang	They have specific repos for wine? I have the development ppa which gave me 1.3.27, but I need 1.3.25 for some program compatibility and building from source failed
2011-09-04T03:54:00.000Z	Polah	bazhang	Okay, I got a .dev for 1.3.25, if I just run it through software centre will it overwrite or should I remove 1.3.27 first?
2011-09-04T03:56:00.000Z	bazhang	Polah	I'd remove then install
2011-10-15T04:28:00.000Z	bazhang	Polah	celltech lets move on please
2011-10-15T04:31:00.000Z	bazhang	Polah	celltech thats enough.
