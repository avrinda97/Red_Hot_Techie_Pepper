2008-01-22T02:24:00.000Z	tanath		my desktop icons aren't showing, and nautilus won't run. can someone help?
2008-01-22T02:24:00.000Z	wyclif	tanath	first what version of nautilus?
2008-01-22T02:25:00.000Z	tanath	wyclif	2.20.0
2008-01-22T02:25:00.000Z	wyclif	tanath	that is the current version.  have you tried checking for dependencies?
2008-01-22T02:25:00.000Z	tanath	wyclif	uh, it's installed fine
2008-01-22T02:26:00.000Z	wyclif	tanath	ok
2008-01-22T02:26:00.000Z	tanath	wyclif	this happened shortly after my power suppy exploded :-/
2008-01-22T02:26:00.000Z	wyclif	tanath	i'm wondering what could be causing your icons to disappear
2008-01-22T02:26:00.000Z	tanath	wyclif	nautilus not working? :P
2008-01-22T02:26:00.000Z	wyclif	tanath	new power supply now?
2008-01-22T02:27:00.000Z	tanath	wyclif	nautilus is s'posed to do the icons too
2008-01-22T02:27:00.000Z	tanath	wyclif	yep
2008-01-22T02:27:00.000Z	wyclif	tanath	i'm looking at my nautilus
2008-01-22T02:27:00.000Z	tanath	wyclif	new user seems to work fine
2008-01-22T02:27:00.000Z	tanath	wyclif	but there's too much on this account for me to switch, so i need to fix this one
2008-01-22T02:28:00.000Z	wyclif	tanath	Preferences > Views on the account with problems
2008-01-22T02:28:00.000Z	wyclif	tanath	make sure you have Icon View enabled
2008-01-22T02:29:00.000Z	tanath	wyclif	i hate icon view. i use list view, and that doesn't affect ability to see desktop icons
2008-01-22T02:29:00.000Z	wyclif	tanath	ah, on the desktop.  sorry
2008-01-22T02:33:00.000Z	wyclif	tanath	you got me.  that is a difficult problem
2008-01-22T02:34:00.000Z	wyclif	tanath	as far as the power supply goes, i don't see how that could be the source (assuming you replaced and rebooted)
