2007-04-28T11:00:00.000Z	uttara		how do I install manual pages for "pthread" library???
2007-04-28T11:00:00.000Z	xtknight	uttara	uh manpages-dev perhaps?
2007-04-28T11:01:00.000Z	uttara	xtknight	I am able to access all the other manual pages. (eg: man 3 malloc)
2007-04-28T11:01:00.000Z	xtknight	uttara	and you have manpages-dev installed?
2007-04-28T11:01:00.000Z	xtknight	uttara	dev has more manpages.  for example printf is there by default but only DEV gives you sprintf, fprintf, and variants
2007-04-28T11:01:00.000Z	uttara	xtknight	I will check it right now
2007-04-28T11:03:00.000Z	uttara	xtknight	manpages-dev has already been installed
2007-04-28T11:03:00.000Z	xtknight	uttara	apt-cache search pthread
2007-04-28T11:04:00.000Z	uttara	xtknight	let me try it  now
2007-04-28T11:08:00.000Z	xtknight	uttara	no such man page exists
2007-04-28T11:09:00.000Z	xtknight	uttara	ah i see.  it should exist according to pthreads(7).  i am not sure.
2007-04-28T11:09:00.000Z	xtknight	uttara	you may file a bug for that pkg saying the Docs are missing.
2007-04-28T11:09:00.000Z	xtknight	uttara	i have glibc-doc and it doesnt have pthread_create docs either
2007-04-28T11:10:00.000Z	uttara	xtknight	"man 7 pthreads" gives pthread_create(3) in the "see also" section
2007-04-28T11:11:00.000Z	xtknight	uttara	glibc-doc: /usr/share/man/man3/pthread_create.3.gz
2007-04-28T11:11:00.000Z	xtknight	uttara	man 3 pthread_create
2007-04-28T11:12:00.000Z	uttara	xtknight	Atlast, I was able to get the documentation. Thanks a lot!!!!
2007-04-28T11:12:00.000Z	uttara	xtknight	It was in glibc-doc
2007-04-28T11:12:00.000Z	xtknight	uttara	ya the key is typing the Three
2007-04-28T11:12:00.000Z	xtknight	uttara	next time "sudo apt-get install apt-file && apt-file update && apt-file search pthread"  :)
2007-04-28T11:13:00.000Z	uttara	xtknight	I will never forget that!!
