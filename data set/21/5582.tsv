2009-02-17T11:31:00.000Z	DoYouKnow		is the output of xrandr
2009-02-17T11:33:00.000Z	DoYouKnow		it doesn't show up there
2009-02-17T11:33:00.000Z	DoYouKnow		yeah
2009-02-17T11:34:00.000Z	DoYouKnow		xrandr shows 1280x1200 as the max, but there is nothing like that in screen resolution
2009-02-17T11:34:00.000Z	DoYouKnow		can I edit xorg.conf? and will it work?
2009-02-17T11:35:00.000Z	DoYouKnow		I'm going to be back in a second
2009-02-17T11:35:00.000Z	DoYouKnow		I'll see if this setting works
2009-02-17T11:37:00.000Z	DoYouKnow		that didn't work
2009-02-17T11:38:00.000Z	DoYouKnow		I tried editing xorg.conf to manually change my resolution. no effect in ubuntu hardy heron
2009-02-17T11:39:00.000Z	DoYouKnow		is there a more manual way of changing the resolution in ubuntu?
2009-02-17T11:40:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	DoYouKnow	It depends what changes you make. What did you add?
2009-02-17T11:42:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	DoYouKnow	Did you add a Monitor section declaring the frequencies the display can support? Usually that is the reason that resolutions are limited.
2009-02-17T11:43:00.000Z	DoYouKnow	IntuitiveNipple	this is a laptop
2009-02-17T11:44:00.000Z	DoYouKnow	IntuitiveNipple	what does screen resolutions do when it needs to change the resolution?
2009-02-17T11:44:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	DoYouKnow	It depends on whether the system can get accurate information from EDID mostly.
2009-02-17T11:45:00.000Z	DoYouKnow	IntuitiveNipple	edid?
2009-02-17T11:45:00.000Z	DoYouKnow	IntuitiveNipple	well, that command I posted earlier reports higher resolutions as being available
2009-02-17T11:45:00.000Z	DoYouKnow	IntuitiveNipple	I'm trying to switch my monitor to those higher resolutions
2009-02-17T11:46:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	DoYouKnow	That sounds promising. What video chipset is it? Are you using a proprietary driver or an open-source driver? Which one?
2009-02-17T11:47:00.000Z	DoYouKnow	IntuitiveNipple	open source driver
2009-02-17T11:51:00.000Z	DoYouKnow	IntuitiveNipple	I just want compiz to work on this system with high resolution
