2007-04-05T16:57:00.000Z	owh	man_id_unknown	We don't know, stop repeating yourself.
2007-04-05T16:59:00.000Z	owh	man_id_unknown	I do not know where you would put a DLL on a Linux machine to run an application I've never heard of. I would try to find the application package, the home page, installation documentation.
2007-04-05T05:01:00.000Z	owh	man_id_unknown	Under Ubuntu you normally don't.
2007-04-05T05:02:00.000Z	owh	man_id_unknown	You are obviously working from some instructions. Where are those?
2007-04-05T05:04:00.000Z	owh	man_id_unknown	Uhm. I'm not sure I follow. I do not know of a way to make a DLL from an interpreted language. DLL's are not normally used in Linux.
2007-04-05T05:05:00.000Z	owh	man_id_unknown	Ok, so it generates DLL's?
2007-04-05T05:05:00.000Z	man_id_unknown	owh	Yes, Sir.
2007-04-05T05:06:00.000Z	owh	man_id_unknown	Or does it generate .so's?
2007-04-05T05:06:00.000Z	man_id_unknown	owh	Ahhh...good point. It generates dlls for WIndows, and .so's for Linux.
2007-04-05T05:06:00.000Z	owh	man_id_unknown	And I'm guessing that you're in #ubuntu because you're running Linux :)
2007-04-05T05:07:00.000Z	man_id_unknown	owh	Indeed, Sir.
2007-04-05T06:08:00.000Z	owh	man_id_unknown	sudo cp
2007-04-05T06:08:00.000Z	man_id_unknown	owh	Thank you. Also, do you know how to create an install.sh batch file?
2007-04-05T06:09:00.000Z	man_id_unknown	owh	I see linux programs use them all the time.
2007-04-05T06:10:00.000Z	owh	man_id_unknown	Well, you create a text file with commands in it, then you make it executable with chmod +x
2007-04-05T06:10:00.000Z	man_id_unknown	owh	Really, that simple?
2007-04-05T06:10:00.000Z	owh	man_id_unknown	Yup. Many examples exist in /etc/init.d/
2007-04-05T06:11:00.000Z	man_id_unknown	owh	thank you.
