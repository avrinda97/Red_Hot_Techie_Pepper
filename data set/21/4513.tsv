2008-11-08T03:34:00.000Z	ay^	russ	still, did you use the nvidia program for settings?
2008-11-08T03:34:00.000Z	ay^	russ	 no :)
2008-11-08T03:35:00.000Z	russ	ay^	no I have not to my understanding
2008-11-08T03:35:00.000Z	ay^	russ	there is a package that something like nvidia-settings, han gon a second I'll look it up
2008-11-08T03:35:00.000Z	ay^	russ	nvidia-settings is the name
2008-11-08T03:35:00.000Z	ay^	russ	install it and use it (with root I think)
2008-11-08T03:37:00.000Z	russ	ay^	I have that installed, only prob is that this is my first experience with linux
2008-11-08T03:37:00.000Z	ay^	russ	it's okay. But ou need to use that app
2008-11-08T03:38:00.000Z	russ	ay^	so I just go to command line and type "sudo nvidia-xconfig" ?

2008-11-08T03:41:00.000Z	ay^	russ	Its pretty straight forward if you know what stuff means, and sadly I'm on my laptop now with a intel gfx, but my desktop has nvidia and dual monitors
