2007-03-18T11:13:00.000Z	mirra		anyone have any idea as to why, after allowing ALL udp traffic through iptables, that pinging domain names, or any domain resolves, will not work
2007-03-18T11:13:00.000Z	mirra		??
2007-03-18T11:14:00.000Z	montyp	mirra	do you have nameservers in your /etc/resolv.conf?
2007-03-18T11:15:00.000Z	montyp	mirra	and you can ping those nameservers by ip?
2007-03-18T11:16:00.000Z	mirra	montyp	no I cant, thats what I dont understand
2007-03-18T11:16:00.000Z	montyp	mirra	hmm, can you ping your router (if you are using one)?
2007-03-18T11:16:00.000Z	montyp	mirra	because maybe the router isn't routing back to you
2007-03-18T11:17:00.000Z	mirra	montyp	it works fine though once I accept all though
2007-03-18T11:17:00.000Z	montyp	mirra	it sounds like a rule ordering problem in iptables then
2007-03-18T11:17:00.000Z	mirra	montyp	the udp stuff is first
2007-03-18T11:18:00.000Z	mirra	montyp	and I tried it as last too
2007-03-18T11:18:00.000Z	montyp	mirra	and do you have "related" and "established" rules?
2007-03-18T11:18:00.000Z	mirra	montyp	no..i thought allowing all incoming UDP (just to test) would have no problem
2007-03-18T11:19:00.000Z	mirra	montyp	what rules should I use for dns then
2007-03-18T11:19:00.000Z	montyp	mirra	i'll pm you and talk
2007-03-18T11:20:00.000Z	montyp	mirra	um, are you registered? I'm talkiing to you in pm :)
2007-03-18T11:21:00.000Z	mirra	montyp	hey sorry
2007-03-18T11:21:00.000Z	mirra	montyp	i am not registered
2007-03-18T11:21:00.000Z	mirra	montyp	can you give me a minute??
2007-03-18T11:21:00.000Z	montyp	mirra	ok. To register: /msg nickserv register <passwd>
2007-03-18T11:22:00.000Z	montyp	mirra	you may have to change your nick, if someone else has registered it ( they proabbly have)
