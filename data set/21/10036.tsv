2005-05-24T05:48:00.000Z	_hp_	shin	why do you need to save w/o a keyboard?
2005-05-24T05:49:00.000Z	shin	_hp_	cause my keyboard somehow died ;.;
2005-05-24T05:49:00.000Z	_hp_	shin	*cough* what are you using to talk in here? hardwired into the net?
2005-05-24T05:50:00.000Z	shin	_hp_	i meant.. its not working in graphical mode... :D
2005-05-24T05:50:00.000Z	shin	_hp_	though i can use ctrl and alt to do some stuff but not write...

2005-05-24T05:52:00.000Z	shin	_hp_	i cant go to synaptic...
2005-05-24T05:52:00.000Z	_hp_	shin	you can probably get it through apt-get, what can't you go to synaptic?
2005-05-24T05:53:00.000Z	_hp_	shin	i am not sure, but i think that vi saves by default if it you get it to crash
2005-05-24T05:53:00.000Z	_hp_	shin	but don't try it
2005-05-24T05:53:00.000Z	shin	_hp_	im trying to open it through console
2005-05-24T05:54:00.000Z	_hp_	shin	are you using X at all?
2005-05-24T05:54:00.000Z	shin	_hp_	yes... but not now...
2005-05-24T05:55:00.000Z	shin	_hp_	as i said... my keyboard somehow kinda died...
