2008-03-31T04:10:00.000Z	soundray	XXarmory555XX	yeah, you were just too absorbed
2008-03-31T04:10:00.000Z	XXarmory555XX	soundray	oh..sry...
2008-03-31T04:10:00.000Z	soundray	XXarmory555XX	the way to reinstall ubuntu is to boot from an install CD and run the installer
2008-03-31T04:11:00.000Z	XXarmory555XX	soundray	ok i tryed that i put the installer cd in the disk drive and booted but nothing any diffrent happend and im aware of that thats wut i want
2008-03-31T04:12:00.000Z	soundray	XXarmory555XX	I don't follow you. What happens when you boot the installer?
2008-03-31T04:13:00.000Z	XXarmory555XX	soundray	ok its like puting a cd with nothing on it it does nothing its starts normaly and goes to the login screen and stuff it dose everything it supose to do on  regualr boot
2008-03-31T04:14:00.000Z	soundray	XXarmory555XX	so it's not booting from the CD. You need to give the CD boot priority in your BIOS setup
2008-03-31T04:15:00.000Z	XXarmory555XX	soundray	o so i eed to go to BIOS got it and wut do i do from there? do i set as boot from cd first?
2008-03-31T04:17:00.000Z	XXarmory555XX	soundray	ok i just relized how to i enter BIOS on ubuntu is it the same as it would be on any other comp like f2 or sumthing?
2008-03-31T04:17:00.000Z	soundray	XXarmory555XX	the BIOS comes with your computer, it's not part of Ubuntu
