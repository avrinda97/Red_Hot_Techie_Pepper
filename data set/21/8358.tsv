2006-06-08T06:37:00.000Z	hav0k		how do i format this hard drive for fat 32 in ubuntu?
2006-06-08T06:38:00.000Z	hav0k		just the disk manager doesnt give fat 32 as an option for formatting
2006-06-08T06:39:00.000Z	Warbo	hav0k	"mkfs.vfat /dev/partitiontoformat" will format that partition as Fat32
2006-06-08T06:40:00.000Z	hav0k	Warbo	thanks, ill try that
2006-06-08T06:40:00.000Z	Warbo	hav0k	Don't mis-type it :)
2006-06-08T06:41:00.000Z	Warbo	hav0k	As long as you know it's name (you can even do that command to a file, then mount the file with the loop option)
2006-06-08T06:42:00.000Z	hav0k	Warbo	alright
2006-06-08T06:44:00.000Z	Warbo	hav0k	That is your drive. You want to make it on the PARTITION (like sdb1, sdb2, etc)
2006-06-08T06:45:00.000Z	Warbo	hav0k	s/c/fdisk will make partitions that you can format
2006-06-08T06:47:00.000Z	Warbo	hav0k	fdisk, sfdisk or cfdisk
2006-06-08T06:49:00.000Z	hav0k	Warbo	how can i find out what the number is for the external hd?  i would guess it would be /dev/sdb1, but i dont know how to find out... under the disk manager, it just has it as /dev/sdb
2006-06-08T06:50:00.000Z	Warbo	hav0k	The first partition on it is sdb1, the second is sdb2 like that. Run "sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdb" to see the numbers
2006-06-08T06:52:00.000Z	hav0k	Warbo	ahhh, i get it, sdb doesnt have any partitions on it yet, its still blank, right out of the box... raw i guess.
2006-06-08T06:53:00.000Z	Warbo	hav0k	You can use "sudo fdisk /dev/sdb" to add one "use "n" then press enter for the defaults and it will fill the disc. Press "w" to write the changes and exit)
2006-06-08T06:55:00.000Z	hav0k	Warbo	its asking for something about First Cylinder (1-19929, default 1)
2006-06-08T06:56:00.000Z	hav0k	Warbo	im pretty sure everyone her is talking to you
2006-06-08T06:59:00.000Z	hav0k	Warbo	thanks for all the help, but i think i just got gparted to do it
2006-08-17T07:17:00.000Z	Warbo	hav0k	What's cairo-dock?
2006-08-17T07:17:00.000Z	hav0k	Warbo	its a dock application i guess... gnome-dock now...
2006-08-17T07:18:00.000Z	Warbo	hav0k	Thanks. I like stuff like that
2006-08-17T07:18:00.000Z	hav0k	Warbo	good luck getting it to work though... ive been working on it for about an hour... in the forums and on here... i just dont know what to do
