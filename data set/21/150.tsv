2012-07-28T13:31:00.000Z	terminhell	Deber	because its ran out of cache on the hdd my guess
2012-07-28T13:31:00.000Z	Deber	terminhell	so what can I do?
2012-07-28T13:31:00.000Z	terminhell	Deber	not copy such HUGE amounts at once
2012-07-28T13:32:00.000Z	Deber	terminhell	well, I just moved the partition to another sector
2012-07-28T13:32:00.000Z	Deber	terminhell	the better question is, how can I restore the data?
2012-07-28T13:34:00.000Z	terminhell	Deber	wait, when you say sector...
2012-07-28T13:34:00.000Z	terminhell	Deber	do you mean partition?
2012-07-28T13:34:00.000Z	Deber	terminhell	what I did on gparted was grow a partition, but the unallocated space was BEFORE the partition, so it moved it.
2012-07-28T13:35:00.000Z	terminhell	Deber	right, it has to move all of that data on the partition around now
2012-07-28T13:36:00.000Z	Deber	terminhell	but it locked up
2012-07-28T13:36:00.000Z	terminhell	Deber	i would literally sleep on it and come back in the morning
2012-07-28T13:37:00.000Z	terminhell	Deber	and disable suspend/screensavers
2012-07-28T13:37:00.000Z	Deber	terminhell	that's what I did. And the harddisk doesn't blink anymore, meaning... no activity
2012-07-28T13:37:00.000Z	Deber	terminhell	there was no suspend/screensaver
2012-07-28T13:37:00.000Z	terminhell	Deber	then its crashed, and well, idk. See if you can possibly cancel the operation
2012-07-28T13:38:00.000Z	Deber	terminhell	I can't, gparted froze. SIGKILL?
2012-07-28T13:39:00.000Z	terminhell	Deber	was an OS on this data?
2012-07-28T13:39:00.000Z	terminhell	Deber	more importantly your root partition?
2012-07-28T13:39:00.000Z	Deber	terminhell	no there wasn't
2012-07-28T13:41:00.000Z	terminhell	Deber	you'll have to run an fschk on it unmounted
2012-07-28T13:41:00.000Z	Deber	terminhell	I can't mount the partition I moved, so, I can't run it mounted
