2011-08-09T17:00:00.000Z	Tophen		Devooooo...
2011-08-09T17:01:00.000Z	Tophen		How long should it take on average? External Hard Drive, 500gb.
2011-08-09T17:01:00.000Z	Tophen		Formatting to EXT4.
2011-08-09T17:02:00.000Z	Tophen		Been a lot longer.
2011-08-09T17:02:00.000Z	Tophen		Maybe an hour now?
2011-08-09T17:03:00.000Z	Tophen		I think it's already fucked.
2011-08-09T17:03:00.000Z	Tophen		Awkies.
2011-08-09T17:03:00.000Z	Tophen		Umm yeah and it's like 4mbps?
2011-08-09T17:03:00.000Z	Tophen		usually about 1-2mbps on average actually.
2011-08-09T17:04:00.000Z	Tophen		Alrighty then.. :)
2011-08-09T17:04:00.000Z	herkupus	Tophen	external means connected via usb?
2011-08-09T17:05:00.000Z	herkupus	Tophen	check if it is actually using usb2.0
2011-08-09T17:06:00.000Z	herkupus	Tophen	that's only usb1.1
2011-08-09T17:07:00.000Z	herkupus	Tophen	usb2.0 would be 480mb/s
2011-08-09T17:08:00.000Z	herkupus	Tophen	try killing the mkfs.ext4 process
2011-08-09T17:11:00.000Z	herkupus	Tophen	i'd say just unplug it if you want to format it anyway later
2011-08-09T17:11:00.000Z	herkupus	Tophen	that's what you said
2011-08-09T17:21:00.000Z	herkupus	Tophen	meanwhile you can check if your machine has a usb2.0 host controller.
2011-08-09T17:22:00.000Z	herkupus	Tophen	type "ls /sys/bus/pci/drivers/ehci_hcd" in a shell and check if some numbers like 0000:00:0b.1 shows up
2011-08-09T17:23:00.000Z	herkupus	Tophen	but for some reason the external harddisk seems not to use it
2011-08-09T17:34:00.000Z	Tophen	herkupus	I just pulled it and it's still working :)
