2007-01-07T16:19:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	break_	lastfm? all I want for xmms is my two front teeth...
2007-01-07T16:23:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	break_	sudo ?
2007-01-07T16:36:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	break_	possible, yes. For you.. perhaps :)
2007-01-07T16:37:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	break_	you build stuff from source in windows?
2007-01-07T16:39:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	break_	Find a precompiled package for your distro. Or upgrade to edgy where you know it's in the repos. Compiling from source is usually not the best options
2007-01-07T16:50:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	break_	yeah, totally. compiling's for gurus and developers...
2007-01-07T16:51:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	break_	ten years ago....
2007-01-07T16:54:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	break_	this isn't windows. There's about 18,000 packages in the official repos and quite a lot more in 3rd party repos... you don't download stuff, just find a repo and install precompiled packages through synaptic..
2007-01-07T16:55:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	break_	you just need to find a repo that has it.
2007-01-07T16:57:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	break_	deb http://hassers.fi/ubuntu dapper lastfm   -- add this to your repos in synaptic, refresh, search again and you should have a lastfm package you can add.
2007-01-07T17:04:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	break_	got it sorted now?
