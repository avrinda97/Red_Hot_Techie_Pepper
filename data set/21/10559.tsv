2005-02-03T08:13:00.000Z	lyy		looks like i mistyped my root password. how do i go about resetting the root password?
2005-02-03T08:13:00.000Z	lyy		no wonder
2005-02-03T08:13:00.000Z	lyy		so..how do i do root stuff?
2005-02-03T08:13:00.000Z	lyy		damn
2005-02-03T08:13:00.000Z	lyy		i don't like sudo
2005-02-03T08:14:00.000Z	lyy		i'll sudo rm -rf /
2005-02-03T08:15:00.000Z	lyy		i think it's dumb
2005-02-03T08:15:00.000Z	lyy		you sudo and type in your own password
2005-02-03T08:16:00.000Z	lyy		that's gotta be the stupidest thing
2005-02-03T08:16:00.000Z	Demitar	lyy	it's simple: sudo passwd; su -c "apt-get remove sudo"
2005-02-03T08:18:00.000Z	Demitar	lyy	su leads to a lot of root consoles lying about.
2005-02-03T08:19:00.000Z	lyy	Demitar	how does su leave alot of root consoles lying about?
2005-02-03T08:19:00.000Z	Demitar	lyy	since "sudo foo bar" is simpler than su -c "" type passwd (again, and again and again)
2005-02-03T08:20:00.000Z	Demitar	lyy	consider the case where there are more than one person with elevated privileges.
2005-02-03T08:22:00.000Z	lyy	Demitar	i just don't like groups with admin power except for root
2005-02-03T08:24:00.000Z	Demitar	lyy	sudo doesn't dictate any policy on that matter.
2005-02-03T08:26:00.000Z	Demitar	lyy	but that doesn't scale in many real-world cases.
2005-02-03T08:26:00.000Z	lyy	Demitar	i guess i'm just kinda ..annoyed
2005-02-03T08:27:00.000Z	lyy	Demitar	i don't really like to have groups created with certain privillages without my say so by default.
2005-02-03T08:29:00.000Z	Demitar	lyy	if you really want it I told you how to do that from the beginning. ;-)
2005-02-03T08:31:00.000Z	Demitar	lyy	since I now have more diskspace than I need the ubuntu way is preferable to the close scrunity on what packages I have installed I usually keep in debian with aptitude.
