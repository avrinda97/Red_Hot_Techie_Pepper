2007-01-21T13:50:00.000Z	martyvis		anyone know how to fix a apt-get issue
2007-01-21T13:50:00.000Z	khermans	martyvis	what is the issue?
2007-01-21T13:51:00.000Z	khermans	martyvis	shouldnt it be gnome-dev ?
2007-01-21T13:52:00.000Z	khermans	martyvis	sudo aptitude update
2007-01-21T13:52:00.000Z	khermans	martyvis	libgnome-dev
2007-01-21T13:54:00.000Z	martyvis	khermans	thanks for that - it probably means that gnome-devel is a borked package
2007-01-21T13:55:00.000Z	khermans	martyvis	most deb-based headers come from -dev not -devel
2007-01-21T13:56:00.000Z	martyvis	khermans	that's what I thought - except someone at the conference I was on suggested gnome-devel
2007-01-21T13:56:00.000Z	martyvis	khermans	does gnome-devel also not install on your system?>
2007-01-21T13:57:00.000Z	khermans	martyvis	maybe for RPM-based distros
2007-01-21T13:57:00.000Z	khermans	martyvis	see if libgnome-dev installs for you
2007-01-21T13:59:00.000Z	martyvis	khermans	libgnome-dev did install - but you probably really wanted me to install libgnome2-dev
2007-01-21T14:00:00.000Z	khermans	martyvis	its up to you what you want to install :-)
2007-01-21T14:00:00.000Z	khermans	martyvis	are you trying to compile something?
2007-01-21T14:00:00.000Z	martyvis	khermans	just a basic hello world program
2007-01-21T14:01:00.000Z	khermans	martyvis	in CLI?  then you dont need gnome-dev
2007-01-21T14:01:00.000Z	khermans	martyvis	just gcc
2007-01-21T14:11:00.000Z	martyvis	khermans	still don't seem to get /usr/include/gtk
2007-01-21T14:12:00.000Z	martyvis	khermans	surely you need gtk to dev on gnome
2007-01-21T14:13:00.000Z	khermans	martyvis	but what you are saying is that you dont have gtk libraries -- gnome does not depend on them
2007-01-21T14:13:00.000Z	khermans	martyvis	aptitude search gtk | grep -i -- -dev
