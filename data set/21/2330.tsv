2010-05-08T09:20:00.000Z	hevnsnt		hello all -- looking for some help with a weird problem..  My headless 8.04 system seems to have lost network connectivity, it can pull dhcp, but cannot talk to my network.   Can anyone point me to how one replaces the tcp stack in linux?  I have booted the system with cd, and hardware works fine
2010-05-08T09:21:00.000Z	greezmunkey	hevnsnt	what makes you think it's tha stack?
2010-05-08T09:22:00.000Z	hevnsnt	greezmunkey	well I put a static dhcp entry in my router and it pulled the correct (and changed) address, however it cannot see the network at all.  No pings, no nmap, no file shares, etc...
2010-05-08T09:23:00.000Z	greezmunkey	hevnsnt	what does ifconfig, and ip route say?
2010-05-08T09:24:00.000Z	hevnsnt	greezmunkey	all what you would expect // I cleared the route table first
2010-05-08T09:24:00.000Z	greezmunkey	hevnsnt	headless, does that include a firewall iptables that is?
2010-05-08T09:25:00.000Z	hevnsnt	greezmunkey	no, it is my nas.. and has been sitting untouched for over a year
2010-05-08T09:25:00.000Z	hevnsnt	greezmunkey	then all of a sudden "its gone"
2010-05-08T09:26:00.000Z	greezmunkey	hevnsnt	do you control the network it's on?
2010-05-08T09:26:00.000Z	hevnsnt	greezmunkey	yes it is my home network
2010-05-08T09:27:00.000Z	greezmunkey	hevnsnt	have you tried tcpdump to see what the NIC is doing?
2010-05-08T09:27:00.000Z	hevnsnt	greezmunkey	ha funny, I am a preacher of wireshark, but have not attempted it -- hah let me go check that
2010-05-08T09:28:00.000Z	greezmunkey	hevnsnt	you said headless, so I assumed no GUI
2010-05-08T09:28:00.000Z	hevnsnt	greezmunkey	yeah sorry just normally no monitor
2010-05-08T09:29:00.000Z	greezmunkey	hevnsnt	sounds like you've got it now, good luck!
2010-05-08T09:29:00.000Z	hevnsnt	greezmunkey	thanks, I will probably get it from here, but can you point me in the direction (reading is fine) of replacing the network driver/stack/etc
2010-05-08T09:30:00.000Z	greezmunkey	hevnsnt	Ihaven't given that much thought, I'd have to read up on it myself, sorry.
2010-05-08T09:30:00.000Z	hevnsnt	greezmunkey	cool -- thanks anyways
2010-05-08T09:31:00.000Z	greezmunkey	hevnsnt	it really can't be that difficult though. Never even considered doing that :)
2010-05-08T09:33:00.000Z	greezmunkey	hevnsnt	can you ping your loopback address? 127.0.0.1?
2010-05-08T09:37:00.000Z	greezmunkey	hevnsnt	Still here?
