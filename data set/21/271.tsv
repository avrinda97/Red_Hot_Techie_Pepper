2012-04-25T11:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cocolos	are you connecting with the -X option?
2012-04-25T11:36:00.000Z	cocolos	ActionParsnip	I tried both I get the same thing
2012-04-25T11:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cocolos	does the system you connect to have an x server running?
2012-04-25T11:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cocolos	because that's what xdpyingo is for, to get details of the x server: http://linux.die.net/man/1/xdpyinfo
2012-04-25T11:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cocolos	so if no x server is running, it wouldexplain why
2012-04-25T11:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cocolos	you'd need to run:  startx    but if you are connected via SSH it will display on the client afaik
2012-04-25T11:42:00.000Z	cocolos	ActionParsnip	what would you suggest
2012-04-25T11:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cocolos	did you install ubuntu server by any chance?
2012-04-25T11:42:00.000Z	cocolos	ActionParsnip	no
2012-04-25T11:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cocolos	what is the output of:  lsb_release -sc    on the server side?
2012-04-25T11:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cocolos	and what desktop environment are you using?
2012-04-25T11:44:00.000Z	cocolos	ActionParsnip	gnome
2012-04-25T11:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cocolos	if you run:  apt-cache policy ubuntu-desktop     is it installed?
2012-04-25T11:46:00.000Z	cocolos	ActionParsnip	what are you thinking?
2012-04-25T11:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cocolos	for some reason the x server hasn't started but enough boot has completed to complete the network setup and start the SSH server
2012-04-25T11:47:00.000Z	cocolos	ActionParsnip	yea but I can do X11 forwarding
2012-04-25T11:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cocolos	hmm, weird. I'd check on the local system somehow (smarthands request) to see what's going on
2012-04-25T11:51:00.000Z	cocolos	ActionParsnip	thanks
2012-05-06T11:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cocolos	or if you're installing nvidia drivers, just install nvidia-current :)
2012-05-06T11:06:00.000Z	cocolos	ActionParsnip	thanks giving it a shot now
2012-05-06T11:09:00.000Z	cocolos	ActionParsnip	I get this now: CUDA error: CUDA driver version is insufficient for CUDA runtime version
