2006-11-02T13:59:00.000Z	savvas	jeff__	wait
2006-11-02T14:00:00.000Z	savvas	jeff__	login in the terminal and try this: sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop
2006-11-02T14:01:00.000Z	jeff__	savvas	ok. trying that now
2006-11-02T14:02:00.000Z	savvas	jeff__	it should get the desktop up and running, but if it doesn't, do: sudo apt-get install --reinstall xubuntu-desktop
2006-11-02T14:03:00.000Z	jeff__	savvas	i'll take note of your second command, in case the 1st doesn't work
2006-11-02T14:07:00.000Z	savvas	jeff__	how's it going? :)
2006-11-02T14:10:00.000Z	jeff__	savvas	re:how's it going? -->apt-get xubuntu-desktop is still doing its thing.
2006-11-02T14:12:00.000Z	savvas	jeff__	hehe ok
2006-11-02T14:17:00.000Z	jeff__	savvas	it's done
2006-11-02T14:18:00.000Z	jeff__	savvas	the apt-get of xubuntu-desktop is done.
2006-11-02T14:19:00.000Z	jeff__	savvas	i've finished running your command "apt-get xubuntu-desktop". how can i check whether xserver works now?
2006-11-02T14:20:00.000Z	jeff__	savvas	i don't know what init.d is, but xubuntu uses xfce
2006-11-02T14:20:00.000Z	savvas	jeff__	ok try sudo /etc/init.d/xfce restart
2006-11-02T14:20:00.000Z	jeff__	savvas	when you are talking to me, please use my name, because it's easier to track messages for me. thanks
2006-11-02T14:20:00.000Z	savvas	jeff__	use sudo /etc/init.d/xdm restart
2006-11-02T14:21:00.000Z	jeff__	savvas	will i lose connection with you guys, if i do that?
2006-11-02T14:22:00.000Z	savvas	jeff__	do what nothlit said: ls /etc/init.d | grep dm
2006-11-02T14:23:00.000Z	jeff__	savvas	nothlit here's the grep results: gdm, mdadm, mdadm-raid
