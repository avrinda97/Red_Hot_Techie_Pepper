2011-01-25T02:54:00.000Z	mbeierl	voodoo719	that is not how you would do that.
2011-01-25T02:54:00.000Z	mbeierl	voodoo719	startx starts an X server on the local hardware.
2011-01-25T02:56:00.000Z	mbeierl	voodoo719	sorry - I don't know that can work that way.  you are trying to access the computer remotely?  is there already a logon to that computer?
2011-01-25T02:57:00.000Z	mbeierl	voodoo719	you can run an application remotely over ssh -X by just typing in its command name.  Like to run firefox remotely: "ssh -X user@host"  then at the prompt "firefox &"
2011-01-25T02:58:00.000Z	mbeierl	voodoo719	I am almost positive startx starts an X server on the remote computer's hardware, not over ssh

2011-01-25T02:59:00.000Z	voodoo719	mbeierl	please can you suggest a way to run my laptop remotely
2011-01-25T02:59:00.000Z	mbeierl	voodoo719	read post #9 of the link I sent.
2011-01-25T03:03:00.000Z	mbeierl	voodoo719	there is microsoft solution built in to Ubuntu. VNC is the "free" choice.  Beyond that you have a few options: NoMachine: http://www.nomachine.com/ , or Teamviewer: http://www.teamviewer.com/index.aspx
2011-01-25T03:04:00.000Z	mbeierl	voodoo719	I meant there is NO microsoft solution.  Remote desktop is MS
2011-01-25T03:04:00.000Z	mbeierl	voodoo719	sorry - gotta run.  best of luck!
