2005-12-01T13:20:00.000Z	it		Anyone tried helping me a little?
2005-12-01T13:20:00.000Z	scoperesolution	it	what's up?
2005-12-01T13:20:00.000Z	it	scoperesolution	 http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/5095 I get this when I try to install wine
2005-12-01T13:21:00.000Z	scoperesolution	it	did you get it from the repo?
2005-12-01T13:21:00.000Z	it	scoperesolution	 I did CVS because the repo wasn't working
2005-12-01T13:21:00.000Z	scoperesolution	it	do apt-get install wine
2005-12-01T13:22:00.000Z	it	scoperesolution	 package wine is not abailavle.
2005-12-01T13:23:00.000Z	it	scoperesolution	 I have the source all CVS'd onto my compy
2005-12-01T13:23:00.000Z	it	scoperesolution	 just when I run wineinstall I get that error
2005-12-01T13:24:00.000Z	scoperesolution	it	well I would say do a repo update and see if that helps, something seems to be missing or your gcc compiler is bad
2005-12-01T13:25:00.000Z	scoperesolution	it	you could always apt-get gcc again
2005-12-01T13:25:00.000Z	it	scoperesolution	 already newest version it says.
2005-12-01T13:26:00.000Z	scoperesolution	it	then you messed something up, it should be able to create exe's, you could always make a simple c program to test the compiler
2005-12-01T13:26:00.000Z	it	scoperesolution	 my C++ works, but I'm not much a C programmer yet.
2005-12-01T13:26:00.000Z	it	scoperesolution	 I almost daily make C++ programs...
2005-12-01T13:27:00.000Z	scoperesolution	it	and they compile just fine?
2005-12-01T13:27:00.000Z	it	scoperesolution	 Yeah.
2005-12-01T13:27:00.000Z	scoperesolution	it	what do you need wine for first off?
2005-12-01T13:27:00.000Z	it	scoperesolution	 I need it so I can run my old windows stuff...my windows went corrupt and explorer.exe stops responding after the login screen.
2005-12-01T13:28:00.000Z	it	scoperesolution	 I don't think so. I've seen it run Counter Strike and stuff.
2005-12-01T13:28:00.000Z	it	scoperesolution	 Well fine, what would you reccomend?
