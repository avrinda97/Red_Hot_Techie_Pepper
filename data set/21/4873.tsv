2009-01-10T14:45:00.000Z	rww	gh0st	Have you tried using the PPA at https://launchpad.net/~transmissionbt/+archive , instead of building it?
2009-01-10T14:46:00.000Z	gh0st	rww	had no idea a site like that existed, thanks man
2009-01-10T14:47:00.000Z	rww	gh0st	no problem. FYI, apt-get will warn you about unauthenticated packages when you use PPAs; read the warning then decide whether or not you trust what is, essentially, packages made by some random person :)
2009-01-10T14:49:00.000Z	gh0st	rww	i understand, thanks many my friend, btw quick n00b question, this reply i sent you, is it all red and stuff like how you sent me?
2009-01-10T14:49:00.000Z	rww	gh0st	yes :)
2009-01-10T14:50:00.000Z	gh0st	rww	excellent, unfortunatley the PPA failed
2009-01-10T14:52:00.000Z	rww	gh0st	"failed" how, specifically?
2009-01-10T14:52:00.000Z	gh0st	rww	i might not have a choice but to build @ this time!
2009-01-10T14:53:00.000Z	gh0st	rww	broken dependency (cache) apparently im not sure what that means, but im gunna plug @ it 1 more time before i try building again
2009-01-10T14:59:00.000Z	gh0st	rww	i win :)
2009-01-10T15:00:00.000Z	gh0st	rww	gtk stuck around for some reason but everything else was removed so it messed up
2009-01-10T15:00:00.000Z	rww	gh0st	Ah, that'd explain it. So the PPA ended up working?
2009-01-10T15:00:00.000Z	rww	gh0st	or did you build it from source?
2009-01-10T15:01:00.000Z	gh0st	rww	the PPA worked, thanks for the advice, btw is there anywere i can read more about these "PPA's" or even just what they stand for or are used for?
2009-01-10T15:02:00.000Z	rww	gh0st	PPA stands for Personal Package Archive. They're basically little mini apt repositories that people use to upload unofficial packages they've built.
2009-01-10T15:02:00.000Z	gh0st	rww	sweet great idea
2009-01-10T15:03:00.000Z	rww	gh0st	Looks like there's more information about it at https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA?action=show&redirect=PPAQuickStart , though that may be a little technical.
2009-01-10T15:04:00.000Z	gh0st	rww	exactly what im looking for, i may be a bit new to some things but, thats exactly how people learn, im not afraid of learning ;)
2011-10-13T10:29:00.000Z	rww	gh0st	ask #vbox or ##windows. That sounds like a problem with your Windows guest, not the Ubuntu host.
