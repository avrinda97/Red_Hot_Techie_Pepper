2009-10-31T07:23:00.000Z	test34	WanHouse	10 years ago they were testing it, now they just sell it right off the production line from china
2009-10-31T07:23:00.000Z	WanHouse	test34	Its cheap though.
2009-10-31T07:24:00.000Z	test34	WanHouse	yes, that's what almost everybody wants;|
2009-10-31T07:25:00.000Z	WanHouse	test34	In contrast, it very well is. But the most expensive RAM can also be broken. I ordered a few of those as well.
2009-10-31T07:26:00.000Z	WanHouse	test34	Crusial ECC for example can also be broken.
2009-10-31T07:26:00.000Z	WanHouse		evenin
2009-10-31T07:27:00.000Z	test34	WanHouse	yeah price isnt everything either... luckily I haven't had any bad RAM yet
2009-10-31T07:27:00.000Z	WanHouse	test34	Ive had plenty. If i get computers that are perfect hardware wise ill be very happy. (Almost never happens)
2009-10-31T07:28:00.000Z	WanHouse	test34	Say you order 50000 computers or so.
2009-10-31T07:29:00.000Z	test34	WanHouse	I only had a couple bad HD in 20 years
2009-10-31T07:29:00.000Z	WanHouse	test34	IBM or Intel i say, to keep them running for a while.
2009-10-31T07:29:00.000Z	WanHouse	test34	Those usually break after some usage
2009-10-31T07:30:00.000Z	WanHouse	test34	IBM-DFT rocks then.
2009-10-31T07:30:00.000Z	WanHouse	test34	Its a drive test but can also fix them
2009-10-31T07:31:00.000Z	WanHouse	test34	Its like a DOS CD /LOL, but it does the job right.
2009-10-31T07:31:00.000Z	WanHouse		Sector/Nibble copy
2009-10-31T07:31:00.000Z	WanHouse		They let you in didnt they ?
2009-10-31T07:32:00.000Z	WanHouse		:)
2009-10-31T07:32:00.000Z	test34	WanHouse	nowadays you need bloated software to get the job done
2009-10-31T07:32:00.000Z	WanHouse	test34	However, check memtest ;)
