2007-10-31T20:52:00.000Z	bsdunix		with FreeBSD, when I am thinking of adding to my system... say... a snes emulator, i just go to /usr/ports/games, find what i want, make install clean. with ubuntu, how do i find what i don't know the package name for?
2007-10-31T20:54:00.000Z	aninhumer	bsdunix	you can search and browse the repos in synaptic, or aptitude if you like cli
2007-10-31T20:55:00.000Z	bsdunix	aninhumer	so man aptitude it is! i thank you very much
2007-10-31T20:56:00.000Z	bsdunix	aninhumer	now checking url w/ lynx
2007-10-31T20:58:00.000Z	bsdunix	aninhumer	lol! you have what is quite possibly the funniest way of making a point. well taken. now, back to the presumption that i don't know pkg name. i do "sudo apt-get install (tab)?"...or...??
2007-10-31T20:59:00.000Z	aninhumer	bsdunix	thanks I think, I'm not sure what you mean by that... :P
2007-10-31T21:00:00.000Z	bsdunix	aninhumer	wonderful. i thank you for your time. i may consider the added dependancies of aptitude worth-while afterall
2007-10-31T21:02:00.000Z	bsdunix	aninhumer	:). your pastebin was of extensive aptitude dependancies list, no? if aptitude provides search of pkg universe via hierarchal structure, then that's worth it to me
2007-10-31T21:03:00.000Z	aninhumer	bsdunix	I think the pastebin was bruenig...
2007-10-31T21:04:00.000Z	aninhumer	bsdunix	and I think it might have been explaining why you should avoid removing with aptitude, maybe I should look at it!
2007-10-31T21:04:00.000Z	bsdunix	aninhumer	no. probably my bad.
2007-10-31T21:06:00.000Z	bsdunix	aninhumer	oh. apt-cache search then, but i'd need to first google up a name?
2007-10-31T21:06:00.000Z	aninhumer	bsdunix	aptitude might be closest to what you were describing with the bsd ports tree structure
2007-10-31T21:07:00.000Z	bsdunix	aninhumer	i think i can take the chance. thanks
2007-10-31T21:07:00.000Z	aninhumer	bsdunix	although as bruening said, it can cause issues with it's overzealous package removal, you should only remove with apt-get
2007-10-31T21:08:00.000Z	bsdunix	aninhumer	thanks
2007-10-31T21:15:00.000Z	bsdunix	aninhumer	want to find an n64 emulator. "aptitude search emulators | less" = nope. "aptitude search games | less" = nope. ??
2007-10-31T21:16:00.000Z	aninhumer	bsdunix	if you just run "aptitude" it launches an ncurses interface
2007-10-31T21:19:00.000Z	bsdunix	aninhumer	this is perfect. thanks. seems ubuntu is so far the only easy-install non-broken linux out there. period.
2007-10-31T21:19:00.000Z	aninhumer	bsdunix	I think aptitude is available in all debian based distros :P
2007-10-31T21:21:00.000Z	bsdunix	aninhumer	ah, but my first attempt to get to know debian proper was overwhelming. slackware was very good, but seemed a bit bare-bones-you're-on-your-own
