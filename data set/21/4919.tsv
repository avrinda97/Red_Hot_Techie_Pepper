2008-10-10T19:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ste1	do you have synaptic open or any other package manipulation program?
2008-10-10T19:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ste1	basically you can only have 1 thing accessing the packages
2008-10-10T19:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ste1	you could try
2008-10-10T19:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ste1	wassup?

2011-12-03T14:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ste1	you can use USB if you like
2011-12-03T14:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ste1	or SD card etc
2011-12-03T14:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ste1	just remember to MD5 test the ISO and if you do use a CD, burn it as SLOWLY as possible
2011-12-03T14:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ste1	cd burning, yes you can use the installed CD burner
2011-12-03T14:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ste1	usb, or pxe boot if you have a pxe server
