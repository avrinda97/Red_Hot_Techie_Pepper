2008-05-04T01:32:00.000Z	Cyntrox		Hey, I'm trying to read a DVD... But /media only contains cdroms, no dvd drive! That's where it's supposed to be, right? Where should I look?
2008-05-04T01:34:00.000Z	graingert	Cyntrox	mount
2008-05-04T01:34:00.000Z	Cyntrox	graingert	Huh?
2008-05-04T01:34:00.000Z	graingert	Cyntrox	type mount at a terminal
2008-05-04T01:35:00.000Z	Cyntrox	graingert	I get info about my partitions.
2008-05-04T01:36:00.000Z	graingert	Cyntrox	does other media (cd's) work?
2008-05-04T01:38:00.000Z	graingert	Cyntrox	try mkdir -p /mnt/cdrom then mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom
2008-05-04T01:38:00.000Z	Cyntrox	graingert	No, CDs does not appear to work. And okay, I will.
2008-05-04T01:38:00.000Z	graingert	Cyntrox	does eject work
2008-05-04T01:39:00.000Z	Cyntrox	graingert	yes
2008-05-04T01:41:00.000Z	Cyntrox	graingert	eject works, and now my terminal seems to be working with the "sudo mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom" command. It is supposed to take long?
2008-05-04T01:41:00.000Z	graingert	Cyntrox	no, it should not take long
2008-05-04T01:41:00.000Z	graingert	Cyntrox	what can you hear?
2008-05-04T01:42:00.000Z	Cyntrox	graingert	I just got the output. "mount: block device /dev/scd0 is write-protected, mounting read-only"
2008-05-04T01:43:00.000Z	graingert	Cyntrox	it's a DVD you can't mount cd's writable
2008-05-04T01:44:00.000Z	Cyntrox	graingert	I only entered the command you specified. Now I seem to be able to read from the CD, though. I'll try the DVD.
2008-05-04T01:45:00.000Z	Cyntrox	graingert	Oh, great... When I press the physical button on my DVD drive, I get an error message saying I don't have the rights to eject this volume.
2008-05-04T01:46:00.000Z	graingert	Cyntrox	ok, you need to umount /mnt/cdrom
2008-05-04T01:47:00.000Z	graingert	Cyntrox	with sudo
2008-05-04T01:47:00.000Z	Cyntrox	graingert	Now everything seems to work perfectly, thanks =)
2008-05-04T01:48:00.000Z	graingert	Cyntrox	yes that is true
