2010-04-09T06:32:00.000Z	Coburn		Heya peeps
2010-04-09T06:34:00.000Z	Coburn		I'm having issues with a MacBook 6,1. Sound isn't working, and I've installed the lastest alsa backport as described in the wiki. Alsamixer says "no mixer elems" found, and I have done the alsa-base.conf model=mbp5 hack. I'm kinda on the borderline of giving up on Ubuntu, any help would be great so I can restore my sanity! :)
2010-04-09T06:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Coburn	 try the beta release yet? it might fix some of the issues..
2010-04-09T06:35:00.000Z	Coburn		Beta release? Which one is that?
2010-04-09T06:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Coburn	 10.04 is out in beta now.. final reelease expected near the end of april
2010-04-09T06:36:00.000Z	Coburn		Also, I got my Macbook's GeForce 9400M GPU working.... Slick as oil compiz FXs!
2010-04-09T06:37:00.000Z	Coburn	Dr_Willis	I also heard the .32 kernel fixes some issues
2010-04-09T06:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Coburn	 I find that a lot with newerr kernels. :)
2010-04-09T06:37:00.000Z	Coburn		I just really don't like running around in circles! I got Wifi working and the GPU working, just don't want to have to update the whole thing again! :P
2010-04-09T06:38:00.000Z	Coburn		Just for sound, that is
2010-04-09T06:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Coburn	 try the latest daily build live cd.
2010-04-09T06:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Coburn	 if it has an issue. file a bug report on it.  Otherwise it may never get fixed.
2010-04-09T06:38:00.000Z	Coburn	Dr_Willis	alright, but 700MB takes a while to download...
2010-04-09T06:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Coburn	 about 15 min here. :)
2010-04-09T06:39:00.000Z	Coburn		There's no LiveCD Torrent?
2010-04-09T06:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Coburn	 there proberly are. but yopu proberly want the latest DailyBuild. it will be the most up to date
2010-04-09T06:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Coburn	 Beta2 was due out today also (or tomorrow)
2010-04-09T06:40:00.000Z	Coburn		Hm, okay.
2010-04-09T06:40:00.000Z	Coburn		Should I upgrade my ALSA in the meantime?
2010-04-09T06:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Coburn	 No idea on alsa upgrades. ive rarely ever had sound issues. Beta2 out today -> http://distrowatch.com/?newsid=05999   test to see if it works.
2010-04-09T06:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Coburn	 if nothing else.. test it to see if it works..if not..file a bug. so perhaps it will get fixed in thefinal release.
