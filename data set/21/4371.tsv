2008-05-09T15:00:00.000Z	suxxor		i`ve got problem with manually installing a packages , after i execute "make" in terminal it show the next this "make[4]: Leaving directory `/home/kaloqn/Desktop/gdb-6.8/gdb/gdbserver'"
2008-05-09T15:00:00.000Z	suxxor		what`s that mean
2008-05-09T15:00:00.000Z	joaopinto	suxxor	there must be a more descriptive error message on the output
2008-05-09T15:01:00.000Z	joaopinto	suxxor	gdb is avaialble from the repositories, you should use it instead
2008-05-09T15:03:00.000Z	suxxor	joaopinto	shall it works i want to see assembly language on linux
2008-05-09T15:03:00.000Z	joaopinto	suxxor	there is no advantage on building gdb by your own, the packages are available to make your life easier
2008-05-09T15:04:00.000Z	joaopinto	suxxor	sudo apt-get install gdb
2008-05-09T15:06:00.000Z	suxxor	joaopinto	it looks like it is install "0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded."
2008-05-09T15:06:00.000Z	joaopinto	suxxor	so it is already installed
2008-05-09T15:06:00.000Z	suxxor	joaopinto	how do i started
2008-05-09T15:08:00.000Z	joaopinto	suxxor	well, you realy need to read some tutorial/manual about gdb, gdb is a complex tool
2008-05-09T15:08:00.000Z	joaopinto	suxxor	man gdb (is a good start)
2008-05-09T15:14:00.000Z	suxxor	joaopinto	i hope so do you know assembly language in linux ?
2008-05-09T15:15:00.000Z	joaopinto	suxxor	not, I don't use assembly language since 10 years agos
2008-05-09T15:16:00.000Z	suxxor	joaopinto	looks like you`ve got huge experience in programing
2008-05-09T15:17:00.000Z	joaopinto	suxxor	yes, anyway, you should not use assembly unless you need to learn it, or you need a low level hardware function
2008-05-09T15:18:00.000Z	suxxor	joaopinto	do you use skype ?
