2006-03-20T07:41:00.000Z	Steve^		i thought it was 172.21.13.17, but that is most likely internal
2006-03-20T07:41:00.000Z	Steve^		My net goes through the university doo-daa
2006-03-20T07:41:00.000Z	Steve^		wwwcache.bath.ac.uk
2006-03-20T07:42:00.000Z	Steve^		!deb
2006-03-20T07:42:00.000Z	Steve^		:P
2006-03-20T07:44:00.000Z	Steve^		so, my ip is 138.38.227.0 and my internal network is 172.21.13.17. That would explain some problems
2006-03-20T07:44:00.000Z	Steve^		I can't ping the external one
2006-03-20T07:46:00.000Z	Steve^		bleh, emacs :P
2006-03-20T07:47:00.000Z	Steve^		Why doesn't something like ifconfig show my external IP? Does it not know?
2006-03-20T07:48:00.000Z	Steve^		and I only know from xchat as it chooses to tell me specially?
2006-03-20T07:48:00.000Z	Morpsemia	Steve^	ifconfig is for your local network card and as far as it is concered, the only ip addr you have on that machine is the local one
2006-03-20T07:48:00.000Z	Steve^		what are the chances that my external ip will change? :P
2006-03-20T07:49:00.000Z	Morpsemia	Steve^	the ip we see is the one on your router, and it really depents on your isp
2006-03-20T07:49:00.000Z	Steve^		my isp is a university
2006-03-20T07:50:00.000Z	Morpsemia	Steve^	mine hasn't changed in a very long time, and my experince is that universitys don't change that often
2006-03-20T07:50:00.000Z	Morpsemia	Steve^	also, since it sounds like your wanting to run a web server, you may want to look into dyndns or another dynamic domain service like it
2006-03-20T07:51:00.000Z	Steve^	Morpsemia	actually no. I have a real one of those. I just need my ip for games and such
2006-03-20T07:51:00.000Z	Morpsemia	Steve^	good deal, I usually just jump on my routers status page for that
2006-03-20T07:52:00.000Z	Steve^		How come the websites can't show a proper ip, like xchat can?
2006-03-20T07:52:00.000Z	Steve^		google for whats my ip
2006-03-20T07:52:00.000Z	Morpsemia	Steve^	your isp may be running a proxie or a site cache
