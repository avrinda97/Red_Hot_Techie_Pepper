2012-09-04T05:32:00.000Z	TJ-	L1	As its a Windows issue the windows tools might reveal more about what is upsetting Windows. As well as looking in the Windows Event Log, check this MSDN article out, its very useful http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/gg463525.aspx
2012-09-04T05:34:00.000Z	L1	TJ-	Thank you, I'll check out those links. In Windows it is marked as RAW when I go into Disk Management. This drive should not be bootable at all - it's purely data
2012-09-04T05:35:00.000Z	TJ-	L1	with GPT, Windows expects certain specific GUIDs to be present. I'm guessing something may have changed in that respect
2012-09-04T05:38:00.000Z	TJ-	L1	I found this mention "I've had a few drives go RAW recently, in the middle of copying like you, and it was caused by poor electric connections (using a poorly made Molex doubler). Most of the time, Windows 7 was able to repair the problem at the next reboot, so definitely something linked to the MBR or the MFT" at   http://hardforum.com/showthread.php?t=1617748
2012-09-04T05:41:00.000Z	L1	TJ-	Thank you very much! I will continue to investigate
2012-09-04T05:42:00.000Z	TJ-	L1	Is the drive in an external caddy/enclosure?
2012-09-04T05:44:00.000Z	L1	TJ-	Nope, it's an internal drive. About 2 months old, so I would hope it's not a hardware issue (perhaps a bad molex would be possible though like that link mentioned)
2012-09-04T05:46:00.000Z	TJ-	L1	I'm reading about some faulty controller chipsets and wrap-around when writing past 2GB capacity (the sector numbers stored in a 32-bit integer wrap around to zero when they get past 2GB and therefore overwrite the first sectors of the disk, causing the index to be lost and the disk showing as RAW in Windows
2012-09-04T05:46:00.000Z	TJ-	L1	Maybe Linux is more tolerant of such issues
2012-09-16T01:36:00.000Z	TJ-	L1	When you want to refer to the contents of a variable, you must prefix its name with the dollar symbol
2012-09-16T01:36:00.000Z	L1	TJ-	I have, haven't I?
2012-09-16T01:37:00.000Z	TJ-	L1	Sorry, I misread! Are you expecting to see the output from "service mysql status" ?
2012-09-16T01:39:00.000Z	TJ-	L1	you need to set a shebang line as line 1 :  "#!/bin/bash"
2012-09-16T01:40:00.000Z	L1	TJ-	Thanks, I'll give that a go
2012-09-16T01:40:00.000Z	TJ-	L1	otherwise, unless you actually pass the script name to a shell command, the system doesn't know how to deal with it. You'll also need to make the script executable "chmod +x <filename>"
2012-09-16T01:52:00.000Z	TJ-	L1	Where precisely are you defining the task for cron?
2012-09-16T01:52:00.000Z	L1	TJ-	I'm doing "crontab -e"
2012-09-16T01:53:00.000Z	TJ-	L1	 and does the user running the script have privileges to run 'service' ?
2012-09-16T01:54:00.000Z	TJ-	L1	when you run a script as a user the shell doesn't do a log-in unless you tell it too, so there's a very minimal environment, not including a PATH
