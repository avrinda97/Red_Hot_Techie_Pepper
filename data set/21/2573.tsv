2010-07-10T11:53:00.000Z	giampiero		I get an error message at startup stating that the daeomn winbind can't be started. What's the daemon winbind for? Should I worry about that?
2010-07-10T11:55:00.000Z	bribroder	giampiero	that's related to either samba or active directory... what do you use for email etc?
2010-07-10T11:55:00.000Z	giampiero		Nothing, no e-amil provider.
2010-07-10T11:56:00.000Z	bribroder	giampiero	what version do you have? 9.10?
2010-07-10T11:57:00.000Z	giampiero	bribroder	nothing, no e-mail provider. Using lucid lynx.
2010-07-10T11:58:00.000Z	giampiero	bribroder	what's daemon winbind for? What's Samba for?
2010-07-10T11:59:00.000Z	bribroder	giampiero	samba is for sharing files with the windows samba / smb protocol
2010-07-10T11:59:00.000Z	bribroder	giampiero	also used in active directory and other ms stuff
2010-07-10T12:00:00.000Z	bribroder	giampiero	try opening a terminal and typing 'winbindd'
2010-07-10T12:00:00.000Z	giampiero	bribroder	so what shouldn't work if winbind does not start? What should I check out?
2010-07-10T12:01:00.000Z	bribroder	giampiero	first see if you can get a more specific error message
2010-07-10T12:01:00.000Z	giampiero	bribroder	tyed it,
2010-07-10T12:01:00.000Z	bribroder		what happened?
2010-07-10T12:01:00.000Z	giampiero	bribroder	typed it, nothing happened.
2010-07-10T12:02:00.000Z	bribroder		no error?
2010-07-10T12:02:00.000Z	giampiero	bribroder	no text whatsoever.
2010-07-10T12:02:00.000Z	bribroder	giampiero	well, you can probably just remove it from your startup
2010-07-10T12:02:00.000Z	bribroder	giampiero	System>Preferences>Startup Applications
2010-07-10T12:03:00.000Z	giampiero	bribroder	I possibly killed it as a process from the system monitor, once it happened that the system was stuck....
2010-07-10T12:06:00.000Z	giampiero	bribroder	it doesn't seem to be among the startup applications. What should I look for?
2010-07-10T12:06:00.000Z	bribroder	giampiero	try setting permissions on all the samba config files: sudo chmod -R 755 /etc/samba
