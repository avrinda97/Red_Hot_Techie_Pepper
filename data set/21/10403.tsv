2005-03-14T07:08:00.000Z	Blissex	dazed	what exactly happens?
2005-03-14T07:08:00.000Z	Blissex	dazed	does X start? If it starts, how?
2005-03-14T07:10:00.000Z	Blissex	dazed	when you turn on your PC, what do you see on the screen at the end of boot?
2005-03-14T07:11:00.000Z	Blissex	dazed	but what is on the screen?
2005-03-14T07:12:00.000Z	Blissex	dazed	so it is not a console login, it is graphical. Is it? Nice windows and the logo?
2005-03-14T07:13:00.000Z	Blissex	dazed	OK, then what you need to do is to tell the system to start GDM instead of that.
2005-03-14T07:13:00.000Z	Blissex	dazed	/etc/X11/default-display-manager
2005-03-14T07:14:00.000Z	Blissex	dazed	login, edit that. probalby it now says 'xdm', put 'gdm' instead.
2005-03-14T07:14:00.000Z	dazed	Blissex	im really hardcore newb...what do i do with that string type it in terM?
2005-03-14T07:14:00.000Z	Blissex	dazed	log in, then _edit_ that file.
2005-03-14T07:15:00.000Z	Blissex	dazed	you now, it is a text file, and you can use something like 'gedit' to cjhange it.
2005-03-14T07:16:00.000Z	Blissex	dazed	change the 'xdm' to gdm'... But wait a sec.
2005-03-14T07:17:00.000Z	Blissex	dazed	open a console window, and type 'which gdm'
2005-03-14T07:17:00.000Z	Blissex	dazed	exactly!
2005-03-14T07:18:00.000Z	Blissex	dazed	OK...
