2008-12-04T06:18:00.000Z	tiyowan	DarkKnight	Which printer is it?
2008-12-04T06:21:00.000Z	tiyowan	DarkKnight	Plug the printer in your PC and turn it on, do you see any notifications pop up saying Ready for printing?
2008-12-04T06:22:00.000Z	tiyowan	DarkKnight	Please do this. Click on System, then Administration, and then Printing. Now choose Add New Printer. Please say whether it detects the printer.
2008-12-04T06:24:00.000Z	tiyowan	DarkKnight	Good. Just click on the Forward button, and then on Apply. You should be all set.
2008-12-04T06:26:00.000Z	tiyowan	DarkKnight	Hang on.
2008-12-04T06:29:00.000Z	tiyowan	DarkKnight	I can't find any solutions on the forums. I'd recommend you try the 2400 drivers, just get it up and running, and search the Ubuntu forums for anyone else with that model.
2008-12-04T06:31:00.000Z	tiyowan	DarkKnight	I'm sorry, I can't help you more.
2008-12-04T06:32:00.000Z	tiyowan	DarkKnight	It could work.
2008-12-04T06:33:00.000Z	tiyowan	DarkKnight	Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal. Then type sudo hp-setup.
2008-12-04T06:36:00.000Z	tiyowan	DarkKnight	Hmmm...I think you need to reinstall hplip from Synaptic Package Manager...try that.
2008-12-04T06:36:00.000Z	tiyowan	DarkKnight	System -> Administration -> Synap. Pack. Man.
2008-12-04T19:01:00.000Z	tiyowan	DarkKnight	Is that what you're seeing when you run hp setup?
2008-12-04T19:03:00.000Z	tiyowan	DarkKnight	Hmm, I can't help you further. I'm still pretty new at this myself; someone else here probably can.
2008-12-14T12:55:00.000Z	tiyowan	DarkKnight	Um, what exactly do you want to do?
2008-12-14T12:55:00.000Z	tiyowan	DarkKnight	Setup a lab using Ubuntu?
2008-12-14T12:56:00.000Z	tiyowan	DarkKnight	You need a router. Couple of switches. That's it.
2008-12-14T12:57:00.000Z	tiyowan	DarkKnight	I don't anything about Ubuntu server/client...some of the more experienced people here could guide you on that.
2008-12-14T13:00:00.000Z	tiyowan	DarkKnight	If you want a simple solution this would work....get a router/switches....install Ubuntu and run all of them. If you want a lab in which one machine is running as a mail server etc. Then you'd need to look into Ubuntu servers and stuff.
2008-12-14T14:17:00.000Z	tiyowan	DarkKnight	I'd recommend you read some of the guides over at the Linux Documentation Project. *Very* helpful and informative.
