2008-07-25T22:31:00.000Z	matt__		hi guys, just installed ubuntu
2008-07-25T22:31:00.000Z	matt__		my date & time are screwed up for some reason
2008-07-25T22:31:00.000Z	matt__		even with the correct timezone set (toronto), the time is behind by 4 hours
2008-07-25T22:32:00.000Z	matt__		does someone know what the deal is
2008-07-25T22:33:00.000Z	ianyale	matt__	try running "sudo ntpdate pool.ntp.org"
2008-07-25T22:34:00.000Z	matt__	ianyale	ive already got it set to use ntp which i suspect is why this error was outputted
2008-07-25T22:34:00.000Z	matt__		root@mattp-laptop:~# ntpdate pool.ntp.org
2008-07-25T22:34:00.000Z	matt__		25 Jul 09:33:36 ntpdate[8096]: the NTP socket is in use, exiting
2008-07-25T22:34:00.000Z	ianyale		you need tos top the ntpd service first to fix the time then
2008-07-25T22:34:00.000Z	ianyale	matt__	/etc/init.d/ntpd stop and then run that command and see if you get the correct time
2008-07-25T22:35:00.000Z	matt__		root@mattp-laptop:~# ntpdate pool.ntp.org
2008-07-25T22:35:00.000Z	matt__		25 Jul 09:35:00 ntpdate[9431]: no server suitable for synchronization found
2008-07-25T22:36:00.000Z	ianyale	matt__	type host pool.ntp.org and see if you get a response. maybe it can't resolve the hostname
2008-07-25T22:36:00.000Z	matt__	ianyale	nope it resolves
2008-07-25T22:37:00.000Z	ianyale	matt__	hmm. you can start your ntpd again (/etc/init.d/ntpd start) and then type "ntpq -p" and it should give you a list of the time servers its synchronizing with
2008-07-25T22:38:00.000Z	matt__	ianyale	europium.canoni and ecmail1.cmc.ec.
2008-07-25T22:39:00.000Z	matt__		i think its truncating those :p
2008-07-25T22:39:00.000Z	ianyale		are there numbers in the delay and offset column? they should be non-zero
2008-07-25T22:40:00.000Z	matt__	ianyale	both 0
2008-07-25T22:40:00.000Z	matt__		i suspect it may be a problem with some firewalling, im behind IBMs network right
2008-07-25T22:44:00.000Z	matt__	ianyale	just needed to use a different time server it seems. thanks for helping
