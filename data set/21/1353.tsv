2010-12-25T00:59:00.000Z	KM0201	ottermaton	is your device supported by b43?
2010-12-25T01:00:00.000Z	ottermaton	KM0201	Actually, looking a little further I do have to use STA.
2010-12-25T01:00:00.000Z	ottermaton	KM0201	It's the 4315 by the way
2010-12-25T01:01:00.000Z	KM0201	ottermaton	ok.. i've never used the STA driver, don't know how it works, etc.
2010-12-25T01:02:00.000Z	ottermaton	KM0201	That's ok. The question is kind of general: In the step which is in both b43 and STA that says: "Under the desktop menu System > Administration > Hardware/Additional Drivers, the b43 drivers can be activated for use. " Since I don't have gnome I won't have that menu. So how do I go about the activation?
2010-12-25T01:03:00.000Z	KM0201	ottermaton	are you using a server install?
2010-12-25T01:03:00.000Z	ottermaton	KM0201	Am I being clear? Do you understand what I'm asking?
2010-12-25T01:03:00.000Z	ottermaton	KM0201	No an Ubuntu derivative. Bodhi
2010-12-25T01:04:00.000Z	KM0201	ottermaton	well, i'd suggest seeking out help from Bodhi developers.
2010-12-25T01:05:00.000Z	ottermaton	KM0201	so...you wouldn't know how to that activation by CLI
2010-12-25T01:05:00.000Z	KM0201	ottermaton	correct....
2010-12-25T01:06:00.000Z	ottermaton	KM0201	ok. Thanks for trying to help
2010-12-25T01:11:00.000Z	KM0201	ottermaton	you can probably modprobe it.. but thats the only guess i'd have
2010-12-25T01:13:00.000Z	ottermaton	KM0201	that's what I was thinking, but I don't really know how to go about it.
2010-12-25T01:14:00.000Z	ottermaton	KM0201	but at least that gives me a start on what to look into
2010-12-25T01:14:00.000Z	KM0201	ottermaton	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx
2010-12-25T01:15:00.000Z	ottermaton	KM0201	Yea, that's what I've been reading. Apparently I'm not being clear about what I'm asking
2010-12-25T01:16:00.000Z	KM0201	ottermaton	there's instructions there to modprobe the device
2010-12-25T01:17:00.000Z	ottermaton	KM0201	you think they would work even though they're for live___ ?
2010-12-25T01:17:00.000Z	KM0201	ottermaton	it should, all its supposed to do is activate the device
2010-12-25T01:18:00.000Z	ottermaton	KM0201	I would tend to agree. I'll give it a go. Thanks for all your help
