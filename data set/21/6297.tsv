2007-09-07T07:34:00.000Z	EvaLuaTe		ok, so i got a tip to install PPPoE for my internet connection to work, i did, but i have no grafical interface, is there a way to configure PPPoE throught the terminal ?
2007-09-07T07:34:00.000Z	EvaLuaTe		s/throught/through/
2007-09-07T07:36:00.000Z	EvaLuaTe		pppoeconfig command not found :/
2007-09-07T07:36:00.000Z	stefg	EvaLuaTe	sudo pppoeconf
2007-09-07T07:39:00.000Z	stefg	EvaLuaTe	you are positive that it is pppoe, and you are not behind a router ?
2007-09-07T07:41:00.000Z	EvaLuaTe	stefg	i unplugged the cable out of the router and plugged it into the modem, shouldn't it work now ?
2007-09-07T07:43:00.000Z	stefg	EvaLuaTe	yes... sometimes it take a reboot or a modem reset. But why aren't you just using the router? Its doing all ther pppoe stuff and on the LAN end everything is just etherent
2007-09-07T07:45:00.000Z	stefg	EvaLuaTe	rather invest time in understanding your router. The NAT and (hopefully) builtin firewall are too neat to waste
2007-09-07T07:46:00.000Z	EvaLuaTe	stefg	this is a bit complicated, as some of the application connecting to the internet do not recognize their real IP, they reply their local IP address, like 192.168.2.100 and stuff like that, and i don't know how to make them work :/
2007-09-07T07:46:00.000Z	stefg	EvaLuaTe	port forwarding
2007-09-07T07:47:00.000Z	EvaLuaTe	stefg	i did port forwarding, but it doesn't work
2007-09-07T07:48:00.000Z	stefg	EvaLuaTe	and to not fall victim to next script-kiddie taking over your box and using it as spam relay you should rather invest time in understanding your router, your setup and your apps :-)
2007-09-19T09:16:00.000Z	stefg	EvaLuaTe	what kind of connection is that? ADSL?
2007-09-19T09:17:00.000Z	stefg	EvaLuaTe	so does it come from the cable provider or from the telco ?
2007-09-19T09:17:00.000Z	EvaLuaTe	stefg	what's telco ?
2007-09-19T09:17:00.000Z	stefg	EvaLuaTe	telephone company
2007-09-19T09:18:00.000Z	stefg	EvaLuaTe	i see.... but you don't know the technical specs? Might be ATM
2007-09-19T09:18:00.000Z	EvaLuaTe	stefg	no, sorry, i don't know any specs
2007-09-19T09:20:00.000Z	stefg	EvaLuaTe	so how does windows connect then? Through pseudo Dialup or by Network Connections ?
2007-09-19T09:20:00.000Z	EvaLuaTe	stefg	network connections
2007-09-19T09:21:00.000Z	stefg	EvaLuaTe	and you had a driver disk from your ISP which you needed to install ?
