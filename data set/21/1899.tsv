2010-05-18T05:43:00.000Z	mrman208		hi, does any one know if it's possible to sync Google Reader with the Liferea RSS Client?
2010-05-18T05:44:00.000Z	mrman208		anyone?
2010-05-18T05:45:00.000Z	edbian	mrman208	Neither do I :(
2010-05-18T05:46:00.000Z	mrman208	edbian	Do you have it set to sync?
2010-05-18T05:46:00.000Z	edbian	mrman208	I don't use google reader
2010-05-18T05:46:00.000Z	mrman208	edbian	Just anything, not just GR
2010-05-18T05:47:00.000Z	edbian	mrman208	I've used lifearea (or whatever) before.  What do you mean "synced"  ?
2010-05-18T05:47:00.000Z	mrman208	edbian	Like synchronized with a server
2010-05-18T05:47:00.000Z	edbian	mrman208	Picking up feeds from another site.  I've done that before.  What's the issue?
2010-05-18T05:49:00.000Z	mrman208	edbian	It is so I can use multiple RSS Clients and have the read articles sync'd between them
2010-05-18T05:50:00.000Z	edbian	mrman208	I don't see anything about sync-ing with other RSS clients on that wiki page...
2010-05-18T05:51:00.000Z	mrman208	edbian	thats why
2010-05-18T05:51:00.000Z	mrman208	edbian	only certain Clients can do it and i was wondering if Liferea did so too
2010-05-18T05:51:00.000Z	edbian	mrman208	I'm not aware of any clients that do that.  I'm sure liferea keeps that information in the .lifearea folder in your /home
2010-05-18T05:52:00.000Z	mrman208	edbian	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetNewsWire this is one that does sync and I use it, it works perfectly and i will see about that .liferea
2010-05-18T05:52:00.000Z	edbian	mrman208	Good luck.  I don't think I can offer any help
2010-05-18T05:53:00.000Z	mrman208	edbian	It said that there is no .liferea folder/file in my /home folder
2010-05-18T05:54:00.000Z	edbian	mrman208	.liferea_1.4   ?
2010-05-18T05:54:00.000Z	mrman208	edbian	I found something
2010-05-18T05:56:00.000Z	mrman208	edbian	Thanks though!
2010-05-18T05:56:00.000Z	edbian	mrman208	No problem!
