2006-09-23T09:33:00.000Z	strav	kitche	if you wanna soulseek under linux look for nicotine
2007-08-29T05:49:00.000Z	kitche	strav	sure they are the easiest thing to get working
2007-08-29T05:49:00.000Z	strav	kitche	some guidance would be appreciated...
2007-08-29T05:49:00.000Z	kitche	strav	sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx
2007-08-29T05:50:00.000Z	strav	kitche	I just said I had installed nvidia-gl
2007-08-29T05:50:00.000Z	kitche	strav	I see that not paying attention to this channel very much but do you have nvidia in your xorg.conf for driver
2007-08-29T05:51:00.000Z	strav	kitche	for not paying attention, I'm sorry. I'm in screen splitted running ircII from a virtual terminal...
2007-08-29T05:55:00.000Z	strav	kitche	is there a kernel module file I can explicitly copy to make shure it's loaded by the kernel?
2007-08-29T05:55:00.000Z	kitche	strav	modprobe nvidia
2007-08-29T05:55:00.000Z	kitche	strav	put sudo infront of modprobe
2007-08-29T05:56:00.000Z	strav	kitche	I already tried modprobing nvidia + glx
2007-08-29T05:56:00.000Z	strav	kitche	still again: module does not exist
2007-08-29T05:57:00.000Z	kitche	strav	then your install is messed up remove nvidia-glx and reinstall
2007-08-29T05:57:00.000Z	strav	kitche	also did that
2007-08-29T05:57:00.000Z	kitche	strav	how are you installing the driver by chance?
2007-08-29T05:58:00.000Z	strav	kitche	I suspect the nividia proprietary drivers did overwrite some file or...
2007-08-29T05:58:00.000Z	strav	kitche	I'm installing from apt now (wish to at least revert to the free drivers)
2007-08-29T06:05:00.000Z	kitche	strav	nv is not part of nvidia-glx it's part of xorg
2007-08-29T06:06:00.000Z	strav	kitche	thanks, I'll check if the xorg nv driver is there too.
2007-08-29T06:09:00.000Z	kitche	strav	xserver-xorg-video-nv should reinstall nv driver not hte nvidia one
