2012-05-28T00:11:00.000Z	macwithlinux	guntbert	it did this checksumming
2012-05-28T00:12:00.000Z	guntbert	macwithlinux	did you compare it with the value on the web site? are they the same?
2012-05-28T00:14:00.000Z	macwithlinux	guntbert	ther is no valeu
2012-05-28T00:15:00.000Z	guntbert	macwithlinux	not possible, what did you type? (please paste the exact command)
2012-05-28T00:18:00.000Z	macwithlinux	guntbert	i did the disk utilety, dint work, i did terminal, -bash: mb5: command not found
2012-05-28T00:19:00.000Z	guntbert	macwithlinux	you did not read correctly - you have to type md5sum  <name of the iso>
2012-05-28T00:21:00.000Z	macwithlinux	guntbert	what do i do with this? where can i compare it
2012-05-28T00:22:00.000Z	guntbert	macwithlinux	please follow http://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM
2012-05-28T00:24:00.000Z	macwithlinux	guntbert	the iso file is corect, but the cd isnt
2012-05-28T00:24:00.000Z	guntbert	macwithlinux	then the download was bad - conside using a torrent
2012-05-28T00:25:00.000Z	guntbert	macwithlinux	ah, so you have a good iso - burn it with low speed
2012-05-28T00:27:00.000Z	macwithlinux	guntbert	i did that both on windows and mac
2012-05-28T00:28:00.000Z	guntbert	macwithlinux	you should not burn the files, follow https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto
2012-05-28T00:30:00.000Z	guntbert	macwithlinux	if the md5sum was the same as on the website you can trust the iso, you just need to burn it correctly
