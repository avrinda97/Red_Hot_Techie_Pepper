2008-05-06T00:10:00.000Z	Dream_Team		I do triboot
2008-05-06T00:11:00.000Z	fryfrog	Dream_Team	did you start with 7.10 or 8.04 installing?
2008-05-06T00:12:00.000Z	Dream_Team	fryfrog	sadly for you I didn't use ubuntu, but you must install grub on the partition (for example /dev/sda3 not /dev/sda) and use fixmbr in windows (xp) cd recovery console
2008-05-06T00:12:00.000Z	Dream_Team	fryfrog	the wiki I have followed was originally for ubuntu so it is great
2008-05-06T00:12:00.000Z	fryfrog	Dream_Team	ah, i'll see if i can find fixmbr in vista
2008-05-06T00:13:00.000Z	Dream_Team	fryfrog	installing windows after linux helps
2008-05-06T00:13:00.000Z	Dream_Team	fryfrog	but you should get rEFIT
2008-05-06T00:13:00.000Z	fryfrog	Dream_Team	i have it
2008-05-06T00:14:00.000Z	Dream_Team	fryfrog	great !
2008-05-06T00:14:00.000Z	Dream_Team	fryfrog	oh, grub won't fix that
2008-05-06T00:14:00.000Z	Dream_Team	fryfrog	bootcamp should
2008-05-06T00:15:00.000Z	Dream_Team	fryfrog	just repartition after bootcamp's work, and use gptsync
2008-05-06T00:15:00.000Z	Dream_Team	fryfrog	the tool in refit for partitionning
2008-05-06T00:16:00.000Z	Dream_Team	fryfrog	I do'nt know how ubuntu is partitionning but you should use a GPT compatible program (cfdisk isn't fdisk isn't but parted/gparted is)
2008-05-06T00:16:00.000Z	fryfrog	Dream_Team	so here is what happens ... I install OSX, bootcamp install windows.  This all works.  I then slice out some space from the OSX, install 8.04.  It works and boots, but leaves the partitions not synced.  So I sync them with the rEFIt tool.
2008-05-06T00:16:00.000Z	Dream_Team	fryfrog	Trust me, triboot is really hard
2008-05-06T00:16:00.000Z	Dream_Team	fryfrog	I could never get it with vista
2008-05-06T00:17:00.000Z	fryfrog	Dream_Team	i see :/
2008-05-06T00:17:00.000Z	Dream_Team	fryfrog	it just doesn't like being the 4th partition, the lastest one available
2008-05-06T00:17:00.000Z	Dream_Team	fryfrog	I needed to use some trick to allow XP to install
2008-05-06T00:17:00.000Z	Dream_Team	fryfrog	so, it's not what you want
