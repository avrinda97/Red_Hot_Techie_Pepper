2007-10-24T16:40:00.000Z	Dmitry_		i tried installing the latest version of gparted, but i was told that "uuid library (libuuid) not found", when it is in fact installed
2007-10-24T16:40:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Dmitry_	its a version that is not in your ubuntu version?
2007-10-24T16:41:00.000Z	Dmitry_	gnomefreak	finally i get an answer from someone. thanks :D. and no, it's 0.3.3
2007-10-24T16:41:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Dmitry_	can not find and not installed are not the same
2007-10-24T16:41:00.000Z	Dmitry_	gnomefreak	i have default 0.2.5 installed.
2007-10-24T16:41:00.000Z	Dmitry_	gnomefreak	in that case, how could i help the installer find it?
2007-10-24T16:41:00.000Z	Dmitry_	gnomefreak	compiler*
2007-10-24T16:41:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Dmitry_	install your version as gparted depends on important libs and that is most likely why it fails.
2007-10-24T16:42:00.000Z	Dmitry_	gnomefreak	did you mean uninstall?
2007-10-24T16:42:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Dmitry_	gparted is not an app that should be installed out side of repos
2007-10-24T16:42:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Dmitry_	yes and use version in your version of ubuntu
2007-10-24T16:43:00.000Z	Dmitry_	gnomefreak	ok. thanks for the help.
2007-10-24T16:43:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Dmitry_	also as a side note that is a good reason noone helped you
2007-10-24T16:43:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Dmitry_	its unsupported
2007-10-24T16:43:00.000Z	Dmitry_	gnomefreak	however, i have another question about gparted.
2007-10-24T16:43:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Dmitry_	?
2007-10-24T16:43:00.000Z	Dmitry_	gnomefreak	i want to make my ubuntu partition bigger. i booted from the ubuntu livecd, and opened gparted
2007-10-24T16:44:00.000Z	Dmitry_	gnomefreak	then tried resizing the partition (it was unmounted), but it told me that i should look for errors and if possible, fix them
2007-10-24T16:44:00.000Z	Dmitry_	gnomefreak	then i did that with "fsck /dev/hdc4", and repeated the earlier procedure. i was given the same error
2007-10-24T16:45:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Dmitry_	thats not gparted that is most likely your hardware.
2007-10-24T16:45:00.000Z	Dmitry_	gnomefreak	i see. i really doubt that, though :P
