2010-10-17T13:37:00.000Z	hobomo		my xterm opens in the root folder by default. anyone know a permanent solution to make it open in the home folder (i.e. some option to add in .Xresources)?
2010-10-17T13:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hobomo	 it depends on where its gettting started at i belive.. how are you launching it?
2010-10-17T13:38:00.000Z	hobomo	Dr_Willis	i launch it with a keyboard shortcut that is set to run the command 'xterm'
2010-10-17T13:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hobomo	 that is weird.. just 'xterm' in a terminal dosent do that does it?
2010-10-17T13:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hobomo	 how did you make this keyboard shortcut?
2010-10-17T13:39:00.000Z	hobomo	Dr_Willis	launching 'xterm' in gnome terminal opens it in the home folder, but i think thats because gnome terminal itself opens in home folder
2010-10-17T13:40:00.000Z	hobomo	Dr_Willis	i used the keyboard shortcuts gui to set it up
2010-10-17T13:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hobomo	 its opening in my users home dir here it seems..
2010-10-17T13:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hobomo	 on wait. its in / :)
2010-10-17T13:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hobomo	 make a script  called 'start-xterm' that does a cd, then starts xterm perhaps..
2010-10-17T13:43:00.000Z	hobomo	Dr_Willis	i was doing that previously but then when i setup more sophisticated xterm aliases, it fouls things up
2010-10-17T13:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hobomo	 it does it with gnome-terminal also it seems.
2010-10-17T13:44:00.000Z	hobomo	Dr_Willis	my gnome terminal opens in home
2010-10-17T13:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hobomo	 that is weirder still. :) could be a loginshell vs non login shell issue.
2010-10-17T13:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hobomo	 doing a google search fines --> http://linuxexchange.org/questions/855/gnome-terminalkeyboard-shortcut-launches-terminal-with-directory-default
2010-10-17T13:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hobomo	 gnome-terminal has a working-directory option. aparenetly xterm dosent  - but this  can work -->    xterm -hold -e "cd $HOME/documents && /bin/bash" &
2010-10-17T13:50:00.000Z	hobomo	Dr_Willis	ill try it
2011-05-08T18:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hobomo	 not totally.. the persistant save changes will NOT get installed to the new system. but  you can use it to insatll a clean system to hd.
2011-05-08T18:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hobomo	 then theres doing a 'full' normal insatll to a hard drive.. you cant install from that.
2011-05-08T18:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hobomo	 so you can install from a live-usb with or without persistant file.
2011-05-08T18:41:00.000Z	hobomo	Dr_Willis	i already have ubuntu installed on my laptop. im trying to make a persistent install to a usb drive, but when im reading tuts online i cant tell if they are meant for creating persistent usb installs or live usb drives (and whether or not there's a difference between the two, which there seems to be)
