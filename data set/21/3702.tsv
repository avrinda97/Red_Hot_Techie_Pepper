2008-10-23T05:43:00.000Z	csilk	GumBall	 so what do you mean when you say "it wont work"
2008-10-23T05:56:00.000Z	csilk	GumBall	 what exactly are you doing?

2008-10-23T05:57:00.000Z	csilk	GumBall	 that what output do you get?
2008-10-23T05:57:00.000Z	csilk	GumBall	 well in that case you now have a fully updated JRE :)
2008-10-23T05:58:00.000Z	csilk	GumBall	 how do you know it didn't work?
2008-10-23T05:58:00.000Z	csilk	GumBall	 java applets will require a plugin for your browser
2008-10-23T06:00:00.000Z	csilk	GumBall	 I'll need 2 mins to find the package name
2008-10-23T06:01:00.000Z	csilk	GumBall	 easiest way to do this is, go to a website that requires the java plugin, firefox will ask if you want to install it
2008-10-23T06:03:00.000Z	csilk	GumBall	ok I'll track the package down
2008-10-23T06:03:00.000Z	csilk	GumBall	 in the mean time please paste the out put of the command  java -version
2008-10-23T06:04:00.000Z	csilk	GumBall	 ok thanks, the ubuntu packages site is being slow right now please give me a minute
2008-10-23T06:07:00.000Z	csilk	GumBall	> <jrib> csilk: sun-java6-plugin  for the one from sun
2008-10-23T06:07:00.000Z	GumBall	csilk	already installed
2008-10-23T06:07:00.000Z	csilk	GumBall	 so thats sudo apt-get install sun-java6-plugin
2008-10-23T06:08:00.000Z	csilk	GumBall	ok, if you have the jre and the plugin installed your going to have to describe exactly what problems your having and what your doing when you get the problem
2008-10-23T06:08:00.000Z	GumBall	csilk	no i meant i already read what he said and installed it
