2012-07-18T02:40:00.000Z	AcidRain2012		ive searched on google quite a bit
2012-07-18T02:40:00.000Z	AcidRain2012		and ubuntu seems to list every driver for every lexmark printer except the one i need, lol
2012-07-18T02:41:00.000Z	AcidRain2012		grrr... what is a good laser printer that works with linux then?
2012-07-18T02:41:00.000Z	AcidRain2012		ill use this printer for target practice
2012-07-18T02:42:00.000Z	AcidRain2012		its cool, i found this old thing at a shop and dude gave it to me. i mean it looks like one hardcore peice of equipment
2012-07-18T02:42:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	AcidRain2012	did you check the lexmark site?
2012-07-18T02:43:00.000Z	AcidRain2012	ActionPa1snip	i found several sites saying that lexmark supported it for linux and it could be found on their site, but when i searched for "x5495" on their site, i got no results
2012-07-18T02:44:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	AcidRain2012	try the europe site, it seems to lik linux
2012-07-18T02:56:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	AcidRain2012	just buy HP in future. HP loves Linux printing :)
2012-07-18T02:56:00.000Z	AcidRain2012	ActionPa1snip	note taken, im looking at hp laser printers now
2012-07-18T07:27:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	AcidRain2012	is the OS fully updated?
2012-07-18T07:28:00.000Z	AcidRain2012	ActionPa1snip	my lucid box is as updated as it can be
2012-07-18T07:29:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	AcidRain2012	Is the lucid system the one having issues?
2012-07-18T07:31:00.000Z	AcidRain2012	ActionPa1snip	yes, but only on this emerson tv, because i dont have the option to adjust the screen size based off the resolution output. i can ONLY adjust vert,horiz screen start point
2012-07-18T07:31:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	AcidRain2012	have you tried Precise (12.04) the newer kernel and driver may help
2012-07-18T07:32:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	AcidRain2012	plus Lucid desktop is EOL in April, giving about 9 months of support...
2012-07-18T07:32:00.000Z	AcidRain2012	ActionPa1snip	.... i will never leave this box. from now on
2012-07-18T07:32:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	AcidRain2012	could try a liveCD, just to test
2012-07-18T07:33:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	AcidRain2012	Lucid will continue to work but it won't be supported anywhere and you will get no updates
2012-07-18T07:34:00.000Z	AcidRain2012	ActionPa1snip	but i dont need updates, ill just keep changing the target to the repos. then ill stay supported. lol
