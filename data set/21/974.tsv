2011-11-29T04:00:00.000Z	uabn93		how do you update grub from within grub??
2011-11-29T04:00:00.000Z	uabn93		does anyone know?
2011-11-29T04:02:00.000Z	uabn93		the newest kernels arent on the list. i never deleted tose
2011-11-29T04:02:00.000Z	mkanyicy	uabn93	then your problem is not as hard as i thought
2011-11-29T04:03:00.000Z	uabn93	mkanyicy	how do i fix it?
2011-11-29T04:03:00.000Z	mkanyicy	uabn93	try to select recovery mode first and see if you can find a working one
2011-11-29T04:03:00.000Z	mkanyicy	uabn93	if you can't then try to edit one of the menu's to point to the latest kernel
2011-11-29T04:05:00.000Z	mkanyicy	uabn93	u there?
2011-11-29T04:08:00.000Z	mkanyicy	uabn93	replace something like: /boot/vmlinuz-3.0.0-13-generic with just /vmlinuz
2011-11-29T04:08:00.000Z	mkanyicy	uabn93	and something like /boot/initrd.img-3.0.0-13-generic with /initrd.img
2011-11-29T04:09:00.000Z	mkanyicy	uabn93	those are symlinks to your latest kernel
2011-11-29T04:09:00.000Z	mkanyicy	uabn93	 then try to boot
2011-11-29T04:15:00.000Z	mkanyicy	uabn93	how did it go?
2011-11-29T04:16:00.000Z	uabn93	mkanyicy	i did what u said. it told me 'ctrl-x to boot' and nothing...
2011-11-29T04:17:00.000Z	mkanyicy	uabn93	then an alternative method that is more likely to work is to use the live cd
2011-11-29T04:17:00.000Z	mkanyicy	uabn93	and then recover grub from it
2011-11-29T04:18:00.000Z	mkanyicy	uabn93	grub-install
2011-11-29T04:19:00.000Z	uabn93	mkanyicy	thanks for everything. you were really helpful
2011-11-29T04:19:00.000Z	mkanyicy	uabn93	no prob, good luck
