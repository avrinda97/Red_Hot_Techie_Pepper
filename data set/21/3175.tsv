2010-05-22T19:52:00.000Z	acicula	Th3On3	you can install samba(3.x) or samba4(4.x)

2010-05-23T01:25:00.000Z	Th3On3	acicula	what does pulseaudio
2010-05-23T01:25:00.000Z	acicula	Th3On3	pulseaudio is a sound mixer, think of it as the traffic cop that governs where audio streams go
2010-05-23T01:26:00.000Z	Th3On3	acicula	 : and mic on skype or simple never works
2010-05-23T01:26:00.000Z	acicula	Th3On3	you have to tweak the skype settings, afaik skype works just fine via pulseaudio, at least it does for me
2010-05-23T01:27:00.000Z	Th3On3	acicula	not tested on 10.04
2010-05-23T01:27:00.000Z	acicula	Th3On3	well i had it working before 10.04 too, just try it?
2010-05-23T01:42:00.000Z	acicula	Th3On3	i see, a script to configure samba4?
2010-05-23T01:35:00.000Z	Th3On3	acicula	how can i provision samba4 from repo
2010-05-23T01:36:00.000Z	acicula	Th3On3	provision?
2010-05-23T01:39:00.000Z	acicula	Th3On3	dunno what you are asking for exactly
2010-05-23T01:41:00.000Z	Th3On3	acicula	: one samba4 git they have a script for creating the configs and all
2010-05-23T01:43:00.000Z	Th3On3	acicula	: ./setup/provision --realm=samdom.example.com --domain=SAMDOM --adminpass=SOMEPASSWORD --server-role='domain controller'
