2008-05-02T22:00:00.000Z	CruX|		this happends only on ubuntu on slackware it works
2008-05-02T22:00:00.000Z	ikonia	CruX|	they are different systems
2008-05-02T22:00:00.000Z	ikonia	CruX|	subversion is available as a pre-compiled package in the repo's
2008-05-02T22:01:00.000Z	CruX|	ikonia	i know but it is not working
2008-05-02T22:01:00.000Z	ikonia	CruX|	that looks like your trying to compile it from source
2008-05-02T22:01:00.000Z	CruX|	ikonia	no
2008-05-02T22:01:00.000Z	ikonia	CruX|	how are you installing it ?
2008-05-02T22:02:00.000Z	CruX|	ikonia	apt-get install subversion....
2008-05-02T22:03:00.000Z	ikonia	CruX|	it's just installed fine for me, no issues at all. I find it hard to see how your getting that error at install time, as that is a reference to a c++ file that shouldn't exist in a pre-compiled package
2008-05-02T22:03:00.000Z	CruX|	ikonia	are you using svnserve ?
2008-05-02T22:03:00.000Z	ikonia	CruX|	yes
2008-05-02T22:04:00.000Z	CruX|	ikonia	and can you send me an example configuration for single user ?
2008-05-02T22:04:00.000Z	CruX|	ikonia	or i put somewhere my config, can you take a look ?
2008-05-02T22:05:00.000Z	ikonia	CruX|	put it in a pastebin if you want
2008-05-02T22:05:00.000Z	ikonia	CruX|	although what your seeing is not a config issue
2008-05-02T22:05:00.000Z	CruX|	ikonia	yes please paste config on pastebin
2008-05-02T22:06:00.000Z	ikonia	CruX|	your problem is not a config issue
2008-05-02T22:06:00.000Z	CruX|	ikonia	i know but if is working for you i wanna try that too
2008-05-02T22:07:00.000Z	ikonia	CruX|	your not having a config issue
