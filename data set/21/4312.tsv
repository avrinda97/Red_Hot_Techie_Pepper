2008-05-16T18:30:00.000Z	shaneireland		how do i reinstall HAL
2008-05-16T18:30:00.000Z	shaneireland		having probs with usb autodetection
2008-05-16T18:30:00.000Z	shaneireland		didnt have anything in /etc/init.d hal related
2008-05-16T18:30:00.000Z	bazhang	shaneireland	need lots more info
2008-05-16T18:32:00.000Z	bazhang	shaneireland	which devices and what do the forums say
2008-05-16T18:33:00.000Z	bazhang	shaneireland	dont need sudo for lsusb command
2008-05-16T18:34:00.000Z	bazhang	shaneireland	and as far as the usb key, is it just a key or a mp3 player--how formatted
2008-05-16T18:35:00.000Z	bazhang	shaneireland	that is very odd, what make of usb drive, and what app are you using to access the photos (eg digikam, et al)
2008-05-16T18:36:00.000Z	bazhang	shaneireland	when did this start not working
2008-05-16T18:37:00.000Z	bazhang	shaneireland	so this worked in gutsy without problem then?
2008-05-16T18:38:00.000Z	bazhang	shaneireland	what about gutsy hardy livecd
2008-05-16T18:41:00.000Z	bazhang	shaneireland	let me take a look
2008-05-16T18:46:00.000Z	bazhang	shaneireland	have you a dual boot
2008-05-16T18:57:00.000Z	bazhang	shaneireland	would you post your fstab; put it in paste.ubuntu.com and give us the url-->have you tried the hal automount trick yet
2008-05-16T19:43:00.000Z	shaneireland	bazhang	sorry i had to jump off there
2008-05-16T19:44:00.000Z	bazhang	shaneireland	did you see it in the fstab or in any way modify the fstab
2008-05-16T19:44:00.000Z	bazhang	shaneireland	aye; but did you do anyting with the fstab perchance?
2008-05-16T19:45:00.000Z	bazhang	shaneireland	well that is a nice short term workaround and more important; did you try wiping the usb key--may have been a unclean removal on another system
2008-05-16T19:47:00.000Z	bazhang	shaneireland	other than the suggestions on that thread not sure
2008-05-16T19:48:00.000Z	bazhang	shaneireland	best not to do that; try creating another user and see if that does something
2008-05-16T19:49:00.000Z	bazhang	shaneireland	yes; create a new user and log into that account
