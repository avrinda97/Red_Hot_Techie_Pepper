2011-01-20T03:43:00.000Z	greppy	jsebean	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NetworkConnectionBridge
2011-01-20T03:45:00.000Z	greppy	jsebean	http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/lucid/en/man5/bridge-utils-interfaces.5.html
2011-01-20T03:45:00.000Z	greppy	jsebean	sorry, I didn't look at the google results close enough to see that it was for an old version.
2011-01-20T03:47:00.000Z	jsebean	greppy	that link above what is that?
2011-01-20T03:47:00.000Z	greppy	jsebean	that is the link at the top of the page that I originally linked you that says "here, use this instead"
2011-01-20T04:10:00.000Z	greppy	jsebean	I asked what kind of bridge you were trying to setup because people sometimes think of connection sharing as bridgeing.
2011-01-20T04:12:00.000Z	greppy	jsebean	so you do want network connection sharing, not a br0 interface.
2011-01-20T04:13:00.000Z	greppy	jsebean	I have used my laptop to share a wireless connection to my desktop before.
2011-01-20T04:14:00.000Z	greppy	jsebean	I didn't bother with getting DHCP passed through it, and used a different network for the desktop/laptop link.
2011-01-20T04:14:00.000Z	greppy	jsebean	with ubuntu
2011-01-20T04:15:00.000Z	greppy	jsebean	http://paste.lopsa.org/78
2011-01-20T04:15:00.000Z	greppy	jsebean	that is my /etc/network/interfaces, sharing the eth0 with eth1, eth0 = wired, eth1 = wireless
2011-01-20T04:16:00.000Z	greppy	jsebean	I just set my desktop to use 10.20.40.2 for it's IP, but you could setup a dhcp server to listen on eth0 to hand out addresses as well.
2011-01-20T04:27:00.000Z	greppy	jsebean	or you can use 192.168.1.1 for your shared network.
2011-01-20T04:37:00.000Z	greppy	jsebean	*nod* so was I, my home network is 172.27.1.0/24, I used 10.20.40.0/24 for the shared connection network.
