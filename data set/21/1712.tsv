2010-05-20T17:17:00.000Z	Swian		anyone had issues with the Nvidia drivers crapping out in Lucid?
2010-05-20T17:19:00.000Z	K-19	Swian	: Depends what are you trying to do..?
2010-05-20T17:20:00.000Z	Swian	K-19	had the driver fail and bring the whole system down last time I installed it
2010-05-20T17:21:00.000Z	Swian	K-19	so I haven't installed it again yet, want to find out if its a known issue
2010-05-20T17:21:00.000Z	K-19	Swian	: Please specify you Hardware!
2010-05-20T17:22:00.000Z	Swian	K-19	intel core 2 2.2ghz, 2gb ram, Onboard video Nvidia on board chip
2010-05-20T17:22:00.000Z	Swian	K-19	think its a geforce 7 series
2010-05-20T17:23:00.000Z	K-19	Swian	: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport
2010-05-20T17:24:00.000Z	Swian	K-19	I'll check it out
2010-05-20T17:26:00.000Z	Swian	K-19	do you know a tool to get the hardware info?
2010-05-20T17:27:00.000Z	K-19	Swian	: dmesg
2010-05-20T17:28:00.000Z	K-19	Swian	: Out-Put http://ubuntu.pastebin.com
2010-05-20T17:28:00.000Z	Swian	K-19	s'all right, I'll work through it
2010-05-20T17:35:00.000Z	K-19	Swian	: Out-Put  ???
2010-05-20T17:37:00.000Z	Swian	K-19	I'm working from home today, so can't get into that now, running the hardware testing to see what it comes up with
2010-05-20T17:48:00.000Z	Swian	K-19	looks like its a geforce 7100 chip, which is not listed as supported on the site you sent me to, thanks
2010-05-20T17:49:00.000Z	K-19	Swian	: Don't jump to conclusion so soon ! try getting more help.
2010-05-20T17:50:00.000Z	Swian	K-19	last time I installed it, worked for several days
2010-05-20T17:50:00.000Z	Swian	K-19	then completely killed the system
2010-05-20T17:51:00.000Z	K-19	Swian	: It is not working since the recent update!! ?
2010-05-20T17:51:00.000Z	Swian	K-19	haven't tried to load it again, I reinstalled the whole os since I hadn't really done much yet
