2012-05-14T00:06:00.000Z	dns_issue		I am having trouble with my ubuntu 12.04 LTS server setup with static ip.  I cannot get ubuntu to recognize the "search xyz.com xyz.local" entries in the resolv.conf..
2012-05-14T00:06:00.000Z	dns_issue		any brave soles here who have been bitten by ubuntu before ?
2012-05-14T00:07:00.000Z	dns_issue		I have static IP address on ubuntu server 12.04
2012-05-14T00:08:00.000Z	dns_issue		I am running local bind for internal resolution
2012-05-14T00:08:00.000Z	dns_issue		.. ubuntu does not honor the "search domain1 domain2 domain3" string in the resolv.conf settings
2012-05-14T00:09:00.000Z	dns_issue		can anyone tell me how to get rid of dnsmasq.. or why to use dnsmasq to begin with ?
2012-05-14T00:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dns_issue	you can set DNS servers in network manager
2012-05-14T00:10:00.000Z	dns_issue		no network manager.
2012-05-14T00:10:00.000Z	dns_issue		headless server
2012-05-14T00:10:00.000Z	dns_issue		no gui
2012-05-14T00:11:00.000Z	dns_issue		is dnsmasq enabled by default in 12.04  ?
2012-05-14T00:11:00.000Z	dns_issue		i am not using dnsmasq
2012-05-14T00:12:00.000Z	dns_issue		where are the dnsmasq config files ?.. how do I verify ?
2012-05-14T00:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dns_issue	could use wicd-curses then, nice UI there
2012-05-14T00:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dns_issue	did you tell dnsmasq to listen on 127.0.0.1 if you are only using it as a local dns cache. I use it in that way
2012-05-14T00:14:00.000Z	dns_issue	ActionParsnip	?  what is wicd-cruses ?
2012-05-14T00:14:00.000Z	dns_issue		no dnsmasq at all
2012-05-14T00:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dns_issue	a text based network manager tool, really handy (specially for wifi configs)
2012-05-14T00:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dns_issue	that's cool. you can set dns in wicd-curses and it will create resolv.conf just like network manager does
2012-05-14T00:14:00.000Z	dns_issue		no wifi.. static ubuntu LTS server for internal backend processing. not desktop
2012-05-14T00:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dns_issue	its just an example, its a good tool to use
