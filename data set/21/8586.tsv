2006-09-22T06:58:00.000Z	spuddogg	tritium	sorry, i did not see the entire thing on my screen the first time
2006-09-22T07:03:00.000Z	spuddogg	tritium	i didnt know that was considered repeating "quickly"
2006-09-22T07:03:00.000Z	tritium	spuddogg	okay.  Try to wait 5 minutes or so.
2006-09-22T07:04:00.000Z	spuddogg	tritium	no prob man....
2006-09-22T07:04:00.000Z	tritium	spuddogg	:)
2006-09-22T07:04:00.000Z	tritium	spuddogg	you're sure you've configured WEP properly?
2006-09-22T07:04:00.000Z	spuddogg	tritium	again, everything works fine with one card, so i can only imagine all settings are correct...maybe a driver problem?
2006-09-22T07:05:00.000Z	tritium	spuddogg	perhaps.  So you're saying WEP works with the other card?
2006-09-22T07:05:00.000Z	spuddogg	tritium	yes
2006-09-22T07:05:00.000Z	tritium	spuddogg	where are your WEP settings kept?  In /etc/network/interfaces?
2006-09-22T07:05:00.000Z	spuddogg	tritium	do i need to run madwifi drivers?
2006-09-22T07:06:00.000Z	spuddogg	tritium	i never checked that...i configured with the GUI
2006-09-22T07:06:00.000Z	tritium	spuddogg	I use an atheros card on my Thinkpad successfully
2006-09-22T07:06:00.000Z	spuddogg	tritium	/etc/network/interfaces is not a directory
2006-09-22T07:06:00.000Z	tritium	spuddogg	right, it's a file
2006-09-22T07:07:00.000Z	tritium	spuddogg	"man wireless" for info on how it can be used to configure wireless parameters
2006-09-22T07:07:00.000Z	tritium	spuddogg	which GUI did you use?
2006-09-22T07:08:00.000Z	spuddogg	tritium	i just added the line wireless-key <key> into /etc/network/interfaces.  im going to try my other card now
2006-09-22T07:08:00.000Z	spuddogg	tritium	brb man
2006-09-22T07:09:00.000Z	tritium	spuddogg	okay
