2007-07-03T10:35:00.000Z	darkfame	peepsalot	are you sure it's not the archive itself?
2007-07-03T10:36:00.000Z	peepsalot	darkfame	well, using tar alone doesn't give any errors
2007-07-03T10:36:00.000Z	darkfame	peepsalot	weird, which version of fileroller?
2007-07-03T10:51:00.000Z	darkfame	peepsalot	if you want a forever fix: unplug it from your motherboard.
2007-07-03T10:52:00.000Z	peepsalot	darkfame	i was asking how to do it without physically going into the case
2007-07-03T10:52:00.000Z	darkfame	peepsalot	modprobe -r pcspkr
2007-07-03T10:56:00.000Z	peepsalot	darkfame	I think that gets reset on every boot though, right?
2007-07-03T10:57:00.000Z	darkfame	peepsalot	just put it in your rc.local file
2007-07-03T10:59:00.000Z	peepsalot	darkfame	where is that file?
2007-07-03T10:59:00.000Z	darkfame	peepsalot	/etc/rc.d
2007-07-03T11:00:00.000Z	peepsalot	darkfame	there is one in /etc and one in /etc/init.d
2007-07-03T11:01:00.000Z	darkfame	peepsalot	sorry, in ubuntu it's in /etc
2007-07-03T11:02:00.000Z	darkfame	peepsalot	the script in /etc/init.d/ just executes /etc/rc.local
2007-07-03T11:02:00.000Z	peepsalot	darkfame	do i need to call sudo in this script, or will it already be running as root?
2007-07-03T11:02:00.000Z	darkfame	peepsalot	no need to sudo
2007-07-03T11:07:00.000Z	peepsalot	darkfame	you are the best.  i've finally been rid of the scourge.
