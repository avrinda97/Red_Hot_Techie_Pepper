2005-12-01T06:23:00.000Z	robotgeek	sven	is it not there in the repositories?
2005-12-01T06:24:00.000Z	sven	robotgeek	no, I changed the sources.list through the wiki, alot of multimedia players are available now, but mplayer stays grayed out
2005-12-01T06:25:00.000Z	robotgeek	sven	did you include backports? mplayer is in multiverse

2005-12-01T07:07:00.000Z	sven	robotgeek	do you know how I can setup the tv-out that it fits the screen? Because I don't know its horizontal and vertical refresh rates.
