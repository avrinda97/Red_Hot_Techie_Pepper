2007-11-28T12:30:00.000Z	Peddy		can I check the temp from Ubuntu? my bios may be incorrect.
2007-11-28T12:31:00.000Z	rlount	Peddy	gkrellm has some good sensor plugins.
2007-11-28T12:32:00.000Z	Peddy	rlount	my CPU usage percentage is really high (like 50%)
2007-11-28T12:33:00.000Z	rlount	Peddy	you are using top to scope this out?
2007-11-28T12:34:00.000Z	Peddy	rlount	system monitor, CPU fire applet, AWN widget.
2007-11-28T12:34:00.000Z	Peddy	rlount	what are the gkrellm plugins called?
2007-11-28T12:35:00.000Z	rlount	Peddy	ah. Are yo getting any specific process info? like which process is pulling the most mem or cpu? you can search for gkrellm in synaptic or just 'aptitude search gkrellm'
2007-11-28T12:36:00.000Z	rlount	Peddy	you just might want to off the greedy bugger that is hogging cpu all the time.
2007-11-28T12:37:00.000Z	Peddy	rlount	beagled
2007-11-28T12:37:00.000Z	rlount	Peddy	yeah. its a pig.
2007-11-28T12:37:00.000Z	rlount	Peddy	it should only index once really heavy a day at the most.
2007-11-28T12:39:00.000Z	rlount	Peddy	you can find the PID of beagled and kill it if you want. It shouldn't last forever tho.
2007-11-28T12:40:00.000Z	Peddy	rlount	problem is fixed. Beagle: very evil for memory
2007-11-28T12:41:00.000Z	rlount	Peddy	 heh. I always thought it was a piggy. Cool tool though.
2007-11-28T12:41:00.000Z	Peddy	rlount	thanks
2007-11-28T12:42:00.000Z	rlount	Peddy	 welcome.
