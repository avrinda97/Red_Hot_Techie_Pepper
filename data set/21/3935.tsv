2008-08-18T09:13:00.000Z	Mecha25	surger	unless you're on a mac, then it's the apple key
2008-08-18T10:08:00.000Z	Mecha25	surger	yeah, you can run Amarok from Gnome, and Rhythmbox from KDE, but they'll look different than other native apps
2008-08-18T10:08:00.000Z	surger	Mecha25	theres a compiz-theme called Crystal that looks real cool
2008-08-18T10:09:00.000Z	Mecha25	surger	not on Gnome, no
2008-08-18T10:09:00.000Z	Mecha25	surger	that's one of the differences.  you CAN have both
2008-08-18T10:10:00.000Z	Mecha25	surger	they're 2 different ways of viewing applications and your system.  You can't install themes for one on the other, but you can have both available.  You can't run both at once, but you can run applications built for either
2008-08-18T10:12:00.000Z	Mecha25	surger	www.gnome-look.org is amazing

2008-08-18T10:15:00.000Z	Mecha25	surger	you have to find one for yourself, I don't know what you like
2008-08-18T10:17:00.000Z	Mecha25	surger	just try them, usually they're bug free or they get removed
2008-08-18T10:20:00.000Z	surger	Mecha25	Is this a theme or just a skin for winamp or something? http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Vortigo+++(+3D%2BVU%2BBeryl%2BDock+)?content=55440
2008-08-18T10:22:00.000Z	Mecha25	surger	a media player
2008-08-18T10:30:00.000Z	Mecha25	surger	the screen you see when ubuntu starts, it's off by default
2008-08-18T10:30:00.000Z	Mecha25	surger	it's a little box that shows your desktop loading progress, nothing to go crazy over
2008-08-18T10:32:00.000Z	Mecha25	surger	I don't, I tried it, it wasn't worth it for me
2008-08-18T10:33:00.000Z	surger	Mecha25	yeah I was reading the how to install this and it seems like alot of work for something silly like that
2008-08-18T10:38:00.000Z	Mecha25	surger	GTK is what Gnome is based off of, Ubuntu uses Gnome, Kubuntu uses KDE
2008-08-18T10:52:00.000Z	Mecha25	surger	no problem
