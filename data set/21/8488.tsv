2006-07-11T06:57:00.000Z	CarlFK	kuzmaster	I just setup vmplayer a week ago, so I am v.new - but I think you use SMB networking to share folders - follow?
2006-07-11T06:58:00.000Z	kuzmaster	CarlFK	ok, thanx. i so love vmware, but im using the trial version of the workstation, so im gonna have to go back to the vmware player soon
2006-07-11T07:01:00.000Z	CarlFK	kuzmaster	 you can move the scrollbar?
2006-07-11T07:01:00.000Z	kuzmaster	CarlFK	apparently so
2006-07-11T07:02:00.000Z	kuzmaster	CarlFK	but its only for the ubuntu tab
2006-07-11T07:02:00.000Z	kuzmaster	CarlFK	very strange
2006-07-11T07:12:00.000Z	kuzmaster	CarlFK	to move the scroll-bar in firefox, rght click the page can choose "switch page direction", do that to reverse it
2006-07-11T07:13:00.000Z	CarlFK	kuzmaster	I was thinking of the left-to-right thing - didn't it flip the text too?
2006-07-11T07:14:00.000Z	kuzmaster	CarlFK	no, the only thing thati can see it do is move the scroll bar
2006-07-11T07:14:00.000Z	CarlFK	kuzmaster	so I see.  weird
2006-07-11T07:15:00.000Z	kuzmaster	CarlFK	is there a vmware irc channel?
