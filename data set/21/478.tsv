2011-11-21T20:35:00.000Z	UICTamale		Hello everyone.  After performing a usual apt-get update/upgrade this morning, my laptop with an ATI graphics card using the open-source drivers on ubuntu 11.10 is running incredibly slowly.  Can anyone help?
2011-11-21T20:36:00.000Z	UICTamale		Everything.  Moving windows, typing in the terminal
2011-11-21T20:36:00.000Z	UICTamale		etc
2011-11-21T20:36:00.000Z	UICTamale		I believe it's all X related
2011-11-21T20:36:00.000Z	UICTamale		The mouse is responding quickly
2011-11-21T20:36:00.000Z	UICTamale		but that's about it
2011-11-21T20:37:00.000Z	UICTamale		Really??  The update manager doesn't really warn you that things might be unusable after just updating your packages.. :[
2011-11-21T20:38:00.000Z	UICTamale		I guess one of my main questions is whether I should be using the open source drivers at all.. with my last laptop I had to use fglrx
2011-11-21T20:38:00.000Z	UICTamale		But I was humming along fine with the open source drivers until 20 minutes ago
2011-11-21T20:40:00.000Z	iceroot	UICTamale	maybe "top" is showing what is causing a high load?
2011-11-21T20:41:00.000Z	UICTamale	iceroot	overall cpu usage is very low, but X is using almost 90%
2011-11-21T20:41:00.000Z	iceroot	UICTamale	any hints in the xorg.log?
2011-11-21T20:42:00.000Z	iceroot	UICTamale	is this also in the logs before you did the upgrade?
2011-11-21T20:43:00.000Z	UICTamale	iceroot	looks like it, yes
2011-11-21T20:43:00.000Z	iceroot	UICTamale	ok then i dont think its the issue
2011-11-21T20:44:00.000Z	UICTamale	iceroot	I'm thinking I should try the proprietary AMD driver
2011-11-21T20:44:00.000Z	iceroot	UICTamale	what is the package-name of the open-source driver you are using?
2011-11-21T20:45:00.000Z	iceroot	UICTamale	maybe "apt-get changelog packagename" has some usefull infos
2011-11-21T20:46:00.000Z	iceroot	UICTamale	last changed 11.08.2011
2011-11-21T20:46:00.000Z	iceroot	UICTamale	both
2011-11-21T20:46:00.000Z	iceroot	UICTamale	on 11.10
