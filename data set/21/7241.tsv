2006-11-19T15:30:00.000Z	Ayabara		can someone please answer if they know? is there a way to remove kubuntu-desktop and kde packages to get back to a pure gnome install?
2006-11-19T15:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Ayabara	Yes.
2006-11-19T15:32:00.000Z	Ayabara	Jordan_U	an easier way than to reinstall? :-)
2006-11-19T15:42:00.000Z	Ayabara	Jordan_U	you just know that it's possible to completely wipe the kde packages, but not how?
2006-11-19T15:45:00.000Z	Ayabara	Jordan_U	that last one was for me I think? thanks
2006-11-19T15:47:00.000Z	Ayabara	Jordan_U	one last Q. you say 'get the list of dependencies in kubuntu bot not ubuntu'. Is this a manual job, or a command line job?
2006-11-19T15:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Ayabara	A command line job, let me try something quickly...
2006-11-19T15:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Ayabara	Try this command http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/32706/
2006-11-19T15:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Ayabara	Are you confortable with the terminal?
2006-11-19T15:51:00.000Z	Ayabara	Jordan_U	yep. thanks. will have to switch to ubuntu first. I want to keep a couple of things. amarok is one. should  just run your line and reinstall afterwards?
2006-11-19T15:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Ayabara	Yes, that would probably be easiest.
2006-11-19T15:52:00.000Z	Ayabara	Jordan_U	ok. off I go. I'll report back :-)
2006-11-19T16:04:00.000Z	Ayabara	Jordan_U	and I'm all gnome again :-D , thanks for helping out
2006-11-19T16:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Ayabara	np, I just ran apt-get install kubuntu and copied the packages it said it would intall then put apt-get remove in front of it :)
2006-11-19T16:06:00.000Z	Ayabara	Jordan_U	ahh. I should've thought about that.
2006-11-19T16:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Ayabara	But you would have needed a system without kubuntu-desktop installed to do it, kind of catch 22.
2006-11-19T16:08:00.000Z	Ayabara	Jordan_U	that's true :-)
2006-11-19T16:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Ayabara	By the way, if you install using the alternate CD in edgy you can just apt-get autoremove kubuntu , but for some reason that won't work for liveCD installs.
2006-11-19T16:09:00.000Z	Ayabara	Jordan_U	ok. hope I will never need to do it ;-)
2006-11-19T16:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Ayabara	But since you installed ubuntu-desktop post install you can go back any time with apt-get autoremove ubuntu-desktop.
2007-07-07T13:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Ayabara	You can't mount ext2/3 from OSx and you can't mount hfs+ RW on Linux unless you turn off journaling :(
