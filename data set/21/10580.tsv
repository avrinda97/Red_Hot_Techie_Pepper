2005-07-24T12:50:00.000Z	desrt		hey guys
2005-07-24T12:50:00.000Z	desrt		don't install breezy :D
2005-07-24T12:51:00.000Z	cafuego	desrt	Too late, been running it for months.
2005-07-24T12:52:00.000Z	cafuego	desrt	it prolly has an xbase-clients issue and/or evolution, yes.
2005-07-24T12:52:00.000Z	cafuego	desrt	yeh, you can install it by hand tho
2005-07-24T12:53:00.000Z	cafuego	desrt	mine seems to work... amd64 though.
2005-07-24T12:54:00.000Z	cafuego	desrt	it wants, but tells me it can't, so doesn't
2005-07-25T06:07:00.000Z	cafuego	desrt	No, OS 10.4.1 (and 2) appear to be slower still.
2005-07-25T06:07:00.000Z	cafuego	desrt	There's a massive performance hit between 10.3.9 and them.
2005-07-25T06:10:00.000Z	cafuego	desrt	No, not in square brackets.
2005-07-25T06:12:00.000Z	cafuego	desrt	they both (can) need them in lookup tabled, but not in the config file.
2005-07-25T06:12:00.000Z	cafuego	desrt	[ip.addr.ess]  would prevent it from doing a lookup.
2005-07-25T06:13:00.000Z	cafuego	desrt	well possible that I got it wrong ;-)
2005-07-25T06:15:00.000Z	cafuego	desrt	mine has no brackets and works fine too.
2005-08-04T07:52:00.000Z	cafuego	desrt	no, not sleep deprived
2005-08-12T06:12:00.000Z	cafuego	desrt	You seem to be awfully busy boycotting
2005-08-12T06:14:00.000Z	cafuego	desrt	boycott people who ask for boycotts
2005-08-12T06:15:00.000Z	cafuego	desrt	true, but politics and boycotting the US isn't topical here.
2005-08-12T09:30:00.000Z	cafuego	desrt	Could you do the same then?
2005-08-12T09:30:00.000Z	cafuego	desrt	nevermind :-)
2005-08-12T09:30:00.000Z	cafuego	desrt	I cross-eyed and retarded today.
