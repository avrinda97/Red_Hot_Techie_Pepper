2011-01-19T09:47:00.000Z	dotblank		gedit has spell check?
2011-01-19T09:48:00.000Z	Leif	dotblank	Yes, it's in tools
2011-01-19T09:48:00.000Z	dotblank	Leif	whoa now thats cool
2011-01-19T09:48:00.000Z	Leif	dotblank	Also, when I go to set language, there's nothing there. :(
2011-01-19T09:49:00.000Z	dotblank	Leif	try language-pack-gnome-en-base
2011-01-19T09:50:00.000Z	dotblank	Leif	try reinstalling it
2011-01-19T09:50:00.000Z	Leif	dotblank	Ah, okay, that one isn't installed, installing now.  Thanks
2011-01-19T09:54:00.000Z	Leif	dotblank	Nope, all still misspelled and no language choices in the dialog. :(
2011-01-19T09:54:00.000Z	dotblank	Leif	it may need to reload the gnome session or something to that degree
2011-01-19T09:54:00.000Z	Leif	dotblank	Mmm...okay.  I guess that implies logging out, thanks.
2011-01-19T09:58:00.000Z	Leif	dotblank	Okay, I got it to work.  It looks like I needed to install pango, or aspell, or both.  Either way, thank you
2011-01-19T09:59:00.000Z	dotblank	Leif	you didn't have pango installed??? yikes
2011-01-19T10:00:00.000Z	Leif	dotblank	Joy, what does pango do?
2011-01-19T10:01:00.000Z	dotblank	Leif	a lot it used as a rendering toolkit used by gtk methinks
2011-01-19T10:01:00.000Z	Leif	dotblank	I inadvertantly purged java from my system a few weeks back, it removed some prety core libraries, I've been suffering ever since.  (But have been learning quite a bit in the meantime, which is why I haven't just reinstalled)
2011-01-19T10:01:00.000Z	Leif	dotblank	Anyway, thank you
2011-01-19T10:02:00.000Z	dotblank	Leif	well you could alsways check to make sure you ahve the ubuntu-desktop metapackage installed
2011-01-19T10:02:00.000Z	dotblank	Leif	if that package is gone then you removed a core component of ubuntu
2011-01-19T10:03:00.000Z	Leif	dotblank	Mmm...good idea
2011-01-19T10:03:00.000Z	Leif	dotblank	Yup, it's gone, but at least it will only take me 25 MB to download it all, so I must have most of it back, thank you.  :)
2011-01-19T10:04:00.000Z	Leif	dotblank	And now it's downloaded.  :)
