2010-05-06T07:20:00.000Z	Patrinstar		hi guys, i ran an update recently, and after rebooting, all I'm getting is my wallpaper, no panel, icons, or anything...however all of the processes (i.e. gnome-panel) are running
2010-05-06T07:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Patrinstar	press ALT+F2 and run nautilus
2010-05-06T07:21:00.000Z	Patrinstar	ActionParsnip	that brings up a filemanager, but doesnt restore my desktop icons
2010-05-06T07:22:00.000Z	Patrinstar	ActionParsnip	interestingly enough, if i run `killall gnome-panel' in a terminal, it appears to restart the process and then the panel shows up
2010-05-06T07:22:00.000Z	Patrinstar	ActionParsnip	kinda strange, its like the process loaded but forgot to display anything
2010-05-06T07:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Patrinstar	hmm, usually nautilus draws the desktop
2010-05-06T07:23:00.000Z	Patrinstar	ActionParsnip	yea i know...for some reason the same trick doesnt work with nautilus
2010-05-06T07:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		!panelfix | Patrinstar
2010-05-06T07:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		!fixpanel | Patrinstar
2010-05-06T07:23:00.000Z	Patrinstar		heh
2010-05-06T07:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		!panel
2010-05-06T07:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		!resetpanel | Patrinstar
2010-05-06T07:25:00.000Z	Patrinstar	ActionParsnip	k, did that, i'll try logging out and back in
2010-05-06T07:25:00.000Z	Patrinstar	ActionParsnip	but i think there's more to it than that
2010-05-06T07:25:00.000Z	Patrinstar	ActionParsnip	since the desktop isnt showing either
2010-05-06T07:27:00.000Z	Patrinstar	ActionParsnip	oh sorry, i was wrong, i can get the desktop to draw if i restart nautilus
2010-05-06T07:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Patrinstar	are the panels ok now though?
2010-05-06T07:28:00.000Z	Patrinstar	ActionParsnip	panels are fine, they just dont show up when i first login...
2010-05-06T07:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Patrinstar	you could make a script to kill the panel then rerun them while you work out a fix
2010-05-06T07:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Patrinstar	if you login as another user is it ok?
2010-05-06T07:30:00.000Z	Patrinstar	ActionParsnip	yea, the thought just crossed my mind, just not a very elegant solution
