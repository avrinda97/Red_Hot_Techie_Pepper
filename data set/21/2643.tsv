2009-08-25T07:44:00.000Z	veinor		I am having issues with my AR9285 wireless card where it's extremely slow under linux.
2009-08-25T07:44:00.000Z	mnaines	veinor	pastebin the output of ifconfig and I'll try to find out the problem
2009-08-25T07:49:00.000Z	veinor	mnaines	any advice?
2009-08-25T07:51:00.000Z	mnaines	veinor	I have a similar problem...Type in "ifconfig wlan0 down" then type "iwconfig rate 54M" then finish it off by typing "ifconfig wlan0 up" then reconnecting to the access point and see what that does
2009-08-25T07:52:00.000Z	mnaines	veinor	Scratch that...The iwconfig line should read "iwconfig wlan0 rate 54M"
2009-08-25T07:54:00.000Z	mnaines	veinor	Did that work?
2009-08-25T08:11:00.000Z	veinor	mnaines	it didn't work
2009-08-25T08:11:00.000Z	mnaines	veinor	Hmm...Pastebin the output of iwconfig wlan0 and I'll have another look
2009-08-25T08:14:00.000Z	veinor	mnaines	http://pastebin.com/m75bf1b1e
2009-08-25T08:14:00.000Z	mnaines	veinor	I see the problem...The bitrate needs to be changed manually...Did you try what I said?
2009-08-25T08:16:00.000Z	mnaines	veinor	What's the closest wifi to you?
2009-08-25T08:16:00.000Z	veinor	mnaines	The hotel wireless network, but this other laptop right next to me gets signal just fine.
2009-08-25T08:17:00.000Z	mnaines	veinor	This is why I am puzzled:  Link Quality=2/70
2009-08-25T08:17:00.000Z	mnaines	veinor	Hmm...Where are you in the hotel?
2009-08-25T08:19:00.000Z	mnaines	veinor	The only other thing I can think of is try using a USB wireless dongle
2009-08-25T08:20:00.000Z	mnaines	veinor	That may be your only option, unfortunately
2009-08-25T08:21:00.000Z	mnaines	veinor	I have not heard good things about the netbooks
2009-08-25T08:21:00.000Z	mnaines	veinor	The "micro laptops" like the netbooks sacrifice usability and battery life for cuteness
2009-08-25T08:21:00.000Z	veinor	mnaines	hm; I heard good things about ndiswrapper on this netbook
2009-08-25T08:22:00.000Z	mnaines	veinor	I would try the ndiswrapper, but don't get your hopes up
2009-08-25T08:22:00.000Z	veinor	mnaines	I can't even get ndiswrapper to work is the problem.
