2007-10-20T16:33:00.000Z	compwiz18		is anyone else having problems with their ranodm programs randomly stopping taking input from their keyboard on Gutsy?
2007-10-20T16:34:00.000Z	wimdows	compwiz18	I had that before on a 7.04 install on a different machine
2007-10-20T16:34:00.000Z	wimdows	compwiz18	never knew what took away the focus tho or how to fix it :-(
2007-10-20T16:34:00.000Z	compwiz18	wimdows	were you on amd64 by chance
2007-10-20T16:35:00.000Z	wimdows	compwiz18	yep AMD64 Athlon
2007-10-20T16:35:00.000Z	compwiz18	wimdows	with x64 ubuntu?
2007-10-20T16:35:00.000Z	wimdows	compwiz18	nope - 32 bit
2007-10-20T16:36:00.000Z	compwiz18	wimdows	ok, do you think reinstalling would help?
2007-10-20T16:37:00.000Z	wimdows	compwiz18	 it may well do, I farted around a lot on that machine with XGL, Beryl and stuff and got random screen distortions after logging in and X would reset.....
2007-10-20T16:39:00.000Z	compwiz18	wimdows	I've only had Gutsy intalled on this machine for a couple of weeks, but I suspect it might have to do with all the upgrades from the beta/prebeta versions
2007-10-20T16:41:00.000Z	wimdows	compwiz18	I'd suggest a clean install - sorry, I don't like saying that! ;-)
2007-10-20T16:41:00.000Z	compwiz18	wimdows	*sigh* I was hoping that wouldn't be the answer ;)
2007-10-20T16:42:00.000Z	wimdows	compwiz18	did a Google search turn up anything?
2007-10-20T16:42:00.000Z	compwiz18	wimdows	nope, nothing on here or ubuntuforums either
2007-10-20T16:44:00.000Z	wimdows	compwiz18	disable compiz and see whether it still happens
2007-10-20T16:44:00.000Z	compwiz18	wimdows	no compiz running
2007-10-20T16:46:00.000Z	wimdows	compwiz18	I'm stumped
2007-10-20T16:47:00.000Z	compwiz18	wimdows	me too, I think a nice fresh reinstall is headed my way
2007-10-20T16:48:00.000Z	wimdows	compwiz18	aye - it's a pain, but it will likely sort it; just very annoying not to figure out what the cause was...
2007-10-20T16:48:00.000Z	compwiz18	wimdows	yeah, ive tried a bunch of stuff to no avail and it's really starting to bug me, esp in firefox
2007-10-20T16:49:00.000Z	wimdows	compwiz18	 yep - when typing in the address bar etc...I know
