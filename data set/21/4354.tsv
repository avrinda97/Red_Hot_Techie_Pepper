2008-05-09T03:56:00.000Z	dsfdfdsfdsfdsdf		Hmm... I have many questions, having just switched to Ubuntu...
2008-05-09T03:57:00.000Z	shivamib	dsfdfdsfdsfdsdf	fear not! fire away
2008-05-09T03:58:00.000Z	shivamib	dsfdfdsfdsfdsdf	no
2008-05-09T03:58:00.000Z	shivamib	dsfdfdsfdsfdsdf	(evolution)
2008-05-09T03:59:00.000Z	shivamib	dsfdfdsfdsfdsdf	evolution is developed by them
2008-05-09T04:00:00.000Z	shivamib	dsfdfdsfdsfdsdf	the package selection is minimal, there are lots of ways to customize it
2008-05-09T04:03:00.000Z	shivamib	dsfdfdsfdsfdsdf	no
2008-05-09T04:03:00.000Z	shivamib	dsfdfdsfdsfdsdf	unfortunately
2008-05-09T04:05:00.000Z	shivamib	dsfdfdsfdsfdsdf	give it some love, in time you'll see how well thought it is
2008-05-09T04:06:00.000Z	shivamib	dsfdfdsfdsfdsdf	once you get the hang of 'linux', it's all consistent
2008-05-09T04:07:00.000Z	shivamib	dsfdfdsfdsfdsdf	you thought you were ranting to help desk staff?
2008-05-09T04:07:00.000Z	dsfdfdsfdsfdsdf	shivamib	? :S
2008-05-09T04:08:00.000Z	shivamib	dsfdfdsfdsfdsdf	welcome aboard :)
2008-05-09T04:09:00.000Z	shivamib	dsfdfdsfdsfdsdf	you can customize that, i guess... along with anything else
2008-05-09T04:10:00.000Z	shivamib	dsfdfdsfdsfdsdf	some people call it 'clean'. but that's just the default theme... go to system -> preferences -> appearance
2008-05-09T04:10:00.000Z	shivamib	dsfdfdsfdsfdsdf	and finger salute aero
2008-05-09T04:10:00.000Z	dsfdfdsfdsfdsdf	shivamib	I like it, but when you move it, it sort of "slugs" around.
2008-05-09T04:11:00.000Z	shivamib	dsfdfdsfdsfdsdf	like, wobbly?
2008-05-09T04:11:00.000Z	dsfdfdsfdsfdsdf	shivamib	Hehe... nah. Not like that. I mean internal GUI elements.
2008-05-09T04:12:00.000Z	shivamib	dsfdfdsfdsfdsdf	oh. well, it's just gtk... and you probably are running on crappy video drivers
2008-05-09T04:13:00.000Z	shivamib	dsfdfdsfdsfdsdf	system -> administration -> hardware driver
