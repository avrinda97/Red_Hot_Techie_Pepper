2008-10-26T16:15:00.000Z	shesek		I'm trying to install ubuntu, why after adding an ext3 partition for / the rest of the space becomes "unusable" so I can't create swap ?
2008-10-26T16:16:00.000Z	shesek		no, just using the installed interface for creating partitions
2008-10-26T16:17:00.000Z	shesek		(I don't really know whats LVM, but I guess it means I'm not messing with it)
2008-10-26T16:17:00.000Z	shesek		nope
2008-10-26T16:17:00.000Z	shesek		ater adding 1 partition it won't let me add any other ones, the rest of the space becomes unusable
2008-10-26T16:18:00.000Z	shesek		I'm just using the normal livecd installer
2008-10-26T16:19:00.000Z	shesek		nope
2008-10-26T16:19:00.000Z	shesek		it has windows on it
2008-10-26T16:20:00.000Z	shesek		3 partitions
2008-10-26T16:20:00.000Z	shesek		the weird thing is that it worked for
2008-10-26T16:20:00.000Z	Nvidiot	shesek	create an extended partition with 2 logical volumes in it, one for your / and one for swap
2008-10-26T16:21:00.000Z	shesek		hmm
2008-10-26T16:21:00.000Z	shesek		I have there some weird 4194mb fat32 partition
2008-10-26T16:21:00.000Z	shesek		not sure what it is
2008-10-26T16:21:00.000Z	shesek		I think its something that windows created? does anyone knows what it is?
2008-10-26T16:21:00.000Z	shesek		(maybe I can just remove iut)
2008-10-26T16:22:00.000Z	shesek		okay, sorry
2008-10-26T16:22:00.000Z	Nvidiot	shesek	if it's a brand-name like HP/Compaq/Dell that may contain extra (bios) tools
2008-10-26T16:22:00.000Z	shesek	Nvidiot	ah, that's probably it
2008-10-26T16:23:00.000Z	shesek		so how do I create an extended partition?
2008-10-26T16:24:00.000Z	Nvidiot	shesek	I don't know, look around in the partitioning tool in the setup
