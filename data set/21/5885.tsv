2007-08-06T14:23:00.000Z	Meyvn	nemo_work	amazing how much stuff fits into 50Mb
2007-08-06T14:23:00.000Z	nemo_work	Meyvn	oh. I'm a big DSL fan. have some customisations for it, and love it since it frees up more room for data
2007-08-06T14:23:00.000Z	nemo_work	Meyvn	boss wants more features though
2007-08-06T14:23:00.000Z	Meyvn	nemo_work	I only tried it a few times to test a virtual machine, it's quite a cool OS
2007-08-06T14:23:00.000Z	Meyvn	nemo_work	especially the system stats on your desktop
2007-08-06T14:23:00.000Z	nemo_work	Meyvn	good idea to keep most of your files on the actual FAT32 drive instead of the virtual drive - reduces wear, speeds shutdown.
2007-08-06T14:23:00.000Z	nemo_work	Meyvn	also increased aggressiveness of backup.tar.gz to eliminate stuff I didn't care about
2007-08-06T14:23:00.000Z	Meyvn	nemo_work	although I couldn't pimp up my resolution to 1280x1024, VM didn't like it much
2007-08-06T14:23:00.000Z	nemo_work	Meyvn	added xtrlock so I could actually walk away from DSL while others were there :)
2007-08-06T14:23:00.000Z	Meyvn	nemo_work	heh
2007-08-06T14:23:00.000Z	nemo_work	Meyvn	btw if you reeeeally want something xtrlock to work, say for a kiosk or something, you need to disable ctr-alt-backspace, ctrl-alt-fX in xorg config, and magic sysrq in kernel and ctrl-alt-del in inittab :)
2007-08-06T14:23:00.000Z	Meyvn	nemo_work	evil :)
2007-08-06T14:28:00.000Z	nemo_work	Meyvn	http://m8y.org/xtrlock (7.4K) is pretty much just commenting stuff out in http://m8y.org/tmp/xtrlock.c - oh, and you need to set password in shadow and suid xtrlock if you use it in DSL.  And of course make sure shadow is persisted in backup.tar.gz
2007-08-06T14:28:00.000Z	Meyvn	nemo_work	thanks, I'll check it out
2007-08-06T14:29:00.000Z	Meyvn	nemo_work	I suck at C :)
2007-08-06T14:30:00.000Z	nemo_work	Meyvn	yeah, is why I have a prebuilt variant of xtrlock.  I mean, if you trust me not to be evil. can disassemble it, is only a few dozen instructions from the xtrlock folks :)
2007-08-06T14:31:00.000Z	Meyvn	nemo_work	heh, well it starts to make sense after I stare at it for a while ;)
2007-08-06T14:32:00.000Z	nemo_work	Meyvn	tried to convince the DSL dudes to add it - felt it'd only add less than a KiB compressed, but they weren't interested
2007-08-06T14:32:00.000Z	nemo_work	Meyvn	me, I need to lock my DSL all the time
2007-08-06T14:33:00.000Z	Meyvn	nemo_work	ah, that's too bad. btw, I gotta run
2007-08-06T14:33:00.000Z	Meyvn	nemo_work	cheerio
