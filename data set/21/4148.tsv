2008-06-30T00:36:00.000Z	FarmCretin		 user_: i tried the command  sudo mount -t auto /dev/sdb /mnt/fantom
2008-06-30T00:37:00.000Z	FarmCretin		and i got mount: you must specify the filesystem type
2008-06-30T00:38:00.000Z	FarmCretin		...
2008-06-30T00:38:00.000Z	snova	FarmCretin	you have to know what the filesystem type is on the device
2008-06-30T00:39:00.000Z	FarmCretin	user_	i feel very silly now
2008-06-30T00:39:00.000Z	snova	FarmCretin	what device is it
2008-06-30T00:39:00.000Z	snova	FarmCretin	did linux create it
2008-06-30T00:39:00.000Z	FarmCretin		no, sudo mount -t auto /dev/sdb1 /mnt/fantom worked
2008-06-30T00:39:00.000Z	snova	FarmCretin	or is it a windows partition
2008-06-30T00:39:00.000Z	FarmCretin		and made the drive
2008-06-30T00:39:00.000Z	snova	FarmCretin	really? i'll have to remember that
2008-06-30T00:39:00.000Z	FarmCretin		yea, -t auto worked fine
2008-06-30T00:40:00.000Z	snova	FarmCretin	i didn't know mount could do that
2008-06-30T00:40:00.000Z	snova	FarmCretin	well, now i do.
