2011-09-30T02:36:00.000Z	Ellipsis753		I'd quite like to split my screen down the middle to make "two mini ones", So I could have 2 "maximised" programs open at any one time. Is this possible? I hear it can be done on windows?
2011-09-30T02:38:00.000Z	LasersFarm	Ellipsis753	Compiz. Download extra plugin. Toggle on "grid" -- You can position the windows many different ways.
2011-09-30T02:38:00.000Z	Ellipsis753	LasersFarm	That may be just what I need, thank you.
2011-09-30T02:39:00.000Z	LasersFarm	Ellipsis753	No problem. Are you using computer or laptop?
2011-09-30T02:41:00.000Z	Ellipsis753	LasersFarm	I'm using a desktop computer, I've got a very nice widescreen, however all that wideness goes to waste 90% of the time, I'm looking for ways to improve my usage of it.
2011-09-30T02:42:00.000Z	LasersFarm	Ellipsis753	Great. It's easier on computer than laptop because of compact keyboard. You can have three columns, or three rows, or 9 windows, or not. You'll see what I mean when you install it and give it a whirl.
2011-09-30T02:50:00.000Z	LasersFarm	Ellipsis753	What is that you're trying to accomplish? You can use multiple Chromium windows. (or Firefox).
2011-09-30T03:03:00.000Z	Ellipsis753	LasersFarm	Thank you, grid is great.
2011-09-30T03:04:00.000Z	LasersFarm	Ellipsis753	No problem. You see how it work when you press it one or two more time? It change the size of the width.
2011-09-30T03:04:00.000Z	LasersFarm	Ellipsis753	Good! :)
2011-09-30T03:04:00.000Z	Ellipsis753	LasersFarm	What are the "indicators?"
2011-09-30T03:05:00.000Z	LasersFarm	Ellipsis753	Related to compiz or a different question? Indicators are a panel icon that bumps all notifcations/indicators in one place.
2011-09-30T03:06:00.000Z	Ellipsis753	LasersFarm	Sorry, in the grid, there's something called indicators, they are orange coloured. I've no idea what they are.
2011-09-30T03:07:00.000Z	LasersFarm	Ellipsis753	Make a screenshot. I'm not on linux. I'm at a friend's farm.
2011-09-30T03:13:00.000Z	LasersFarm	Ellipsis753	Use imagebin.org
2011-09-30T03:13:00.000Z	LasersFarm	Ellipsis753	And I'm using web-based IRC. :3
2011-09-30T03:14:00.000Z	Ellipsis753	LasersFarm	Oops, sorry,  http://imagebin.org/176789
2011-09-30T03:15:00.000Z	LasersFarm	Ellipsis753	Oh it's just a line. Before you let go of the keypad.
2011-09-30T03:15:00.000Z	LasersFarm	Ellipsis753	If you toggle it off, you shouldn't be able to see which change you might want. YOu can tgest it.
2011-09-30T03:22:00.000Z	Ellipsis753	LasersFarm	Thank you.
2011-09-30T03:22:00.000Z	LasersFarm	Ellipsis753	You're welcome!
