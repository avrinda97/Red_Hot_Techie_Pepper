2005-04-22T14:45:00.000Z	K-Rich		thanks
2005-04-22T14:45:00.000Z	SeamusLP	K-Rich	I'd apt-get all the necessary packages for one box and put them on an http server.  Use that to upgrade the rest :)
2005-04-26T13:41:00.000Z	SeamusLP	K-Rich	is your user in the cdrom group?
2005-04-26T13:41:00.000Z	K-Rich	SeamusLP	yes
2005-04-26T13:42:00.000Z	SeamusLP	K-Rich	what are you using to burn?
2005-04-26T13:47:00.000Z	K-Rich	SeamusLP	/dev/hdc is root.cdrom rw-rw----  /dev/cdrom is root.root rwxrwxrwx
2005-04-26T13:49:00.000Z	SeamusLP	K-Rich	-- It looks like your /dev/cdrom which is a symlink to /dev/hdc is in the root group whereas /dev/hdc is cdrom
2005-04-26T13:49:00.000Z	SeamusLP	K-Rich	if your programs are trying to access /dev/cdrom they'll need root
2005-04-26T13:50:00.000Z	K-Rich	SeamusLP	trying to access it as /dev/hdc though :/ i'm reading now where it may be an issue with the 2.6.8 and cdrecord
2005-04-26T13:50:00.000Z	SeamusLP	K-Rich	Hummm what kernel are you using?
2005-04-26T13:50:00.000Z	K-Rich	SeamusLP	2.6.8.1-5-686
2005-04-26T13:50:00.000Z	SeamusLP	K-Rich	I've got the latest 686  from the repos and my cdrecord burner (gnomebaker) is working fine
2005-04-26T13:51:00.000Z	SeamusLP	K-Rich	 Warty Warthog?
2005-04-26T13:52:00.000Z	K-Rich	SeamusLP	this is driving me nuts lol i've tried suid root on cdrecord and cdrdao
2005-04-26T13:52:00.000Z	K-Rich	SeamusLP	yeah, did a custom install then added x-window-system-core and xfce4
2005-04-26T13:53:00.000Z	SeamusLP	K-Rich	Have you tried a non cdrecord burner?
2005-04-26T13:53:00.000Z	SeamusLP	K-Rich	I think graveman may use something else
2005-04-26T13:55:00.000Z	SeamusLP	K-Rich	Perhaps it is related to the kernel then
2005-04-26T13:55:00.000Z	SeamusLP	K-Rich	If you want the latest one you can compile it yourself or just dist-upgrade to hoary hedgehog
2005-04-26T13:56:00.000Z	K-Rich	SeamusLP	screw it, just install gksu and i'll use gksudo lol
2005-04-26T13:57:00.000Z	SeamusLP	K-Rich	 I'd recommend posting to or searching the forums.  Someone else must have had that problem if it's related to a kernel in warty.
