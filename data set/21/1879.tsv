2010-06-18T10:20:00.000Z	fotoflo		hey all, im running ubuntu server, i think it's 6.04 and the version of privoxy that apt-get installs is an old version which doesn't support socks5 ... how do i upgrade privoxy manually? Must I do a dist-upgrade?
2010-06-18T10:20:00.000Z	fotoflo		and how likely is a dist-upgrade to break the services im running now?
2010-06-18T10:20:00.000Z	red2kic	fotoflo	We're at 10.04.
2010-06-18T10:21:00.000Z	fotoflo	red2kic	and im running server
2010-06-18T10:22:00.000Z	red2kic	fotoflo	Ahh, I see. >_>
2010-06-18T10:22:00.000Z	fotoflo	red2kic	still supported for another year
2010-06-18T10:23:00.000Z	red2kic	fotoflo	Either !backport or check Launchpad for updated ppa/deb of the said package.
2010-06-18T10:24:00.000Z	fotoflo	red2kic	thanks
2010-06-18T10:25:00.000Z	red2kic	fotoflo	No problem. Good luck.
2010-06-18T10:25:00.000Z	fotoflo	red2kic	btw, how likely is a dist-upgrade to break my running services (mediawiki is the most important one)
2010-06-18T10:26:00.000Z	red2kic	fotoflo	I can't say anything as it is difficult to foretell the future. However, you are always advised to make backups first.
2010-06-18T10:35:00.000Z	red2kic	fotoflo	privoxy?
2010-06-18T10:35:00.000Z	fotoflo	red2kic	yeah
2010-06-18T10:35:00.000Z	red2kic	fotoflo	What are you on and what are you looking for? Why the needs to update?
2010-06-18T10:37:00.000Z	fotoflo	red2kic	Privoxy version 3.0.8 - newest is 3.0.16, my version supports socks4 and 4a, but I use a tunnel - aka socks5

2010-06-18T10:43:00.000Z	red2kic	fotoflo	There are #Installing a single package but there are also "#How to request new packages"
2010-06-18T10:43:00.000Z	red2kic	fotoflo	You should try and request. Wait few days. See if things are going your way.
2010-06-18T10:44:00.000Z	fotoflo	red2kic	interesting... how activly is this maintained?
2010-06-18T10:45:00.000Z	red2kic	fotoflo	I have no slight idea -- but I imagine it's well active. I used backport kernels for my netbook to work with wifi.
2010-06-18T10:50:00.000Z	fotoflo	red2kic	 cool, requesting
