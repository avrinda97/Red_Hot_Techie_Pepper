2009-02-12T09:18:00.000Z	Wee		would anyone happen to know of an easy-to-use (easy-to-use, as in, my grandma should be able to use it) screenshot utility that offers the ability the ability to select/draw the focused to-be-shot recatange-area?
2009-02-12T09:18:00.000Z	rdw200169	Wee	you should just hit the screenshot key!
2009-02-12T09:19:00.000Z	rdw200169	Wee	i.e. Print Screen
2009-02-12T09:19:00.000Z	rdw200169	Wee	go ahead, try it!
2009-02-12T09:19:00.000Z	Wee	rdw200169	yes.. but that doesn't allow me to draw a triangle for selection (I don't want to ss the whole screen)
2009-02-12T09:19:00.000Z	Wee		s/triangle/rectangle
2009-02-12T09:20:00.000Z	rdw200169	Wee	well, the old windows rules apply, try Alt + Print Screen
2009-02-12T09:20:00.000Z	rdw200169	Wee	that gets the active window instead of the whole desktop
2009-02-12T09:20:00.000Z	Wee	rdw200169	that captures the focused window - I would prefer capturing a focused area as selected by designating a certain area myself with some sort of a selection tool
2009-02-12T09:21:00.000Z	rdw200169	Wee	you're making this really difficult!... you can use f-spot for simple picture editing
2009-02-12T09:21:00.000Z	Wee	rdw200169	..actually, this is for my very irritated computer-illeterate mate, who insists on getting that functionality. sorry ;\
2009-02-12T09:22:00.000Z	rdw200169	Wee	i don't even think windows can do that, but i don't know
2009-02-12T09:22:00.000Z	Wee	rdw200169	oh.. he SHOWED me the program on windows that could do it.. he simply hits the screenshot button.. and after a few seconds his mouse cursor turns into a selection tool.. he selects it, and it's on the clipboard..
2009-02-12T09:24:00.000Z	rdw200169	Wee	perhaps you should tell your very-irritated friend to do the same thing he did on windows to find the app, use google: https://launchpad.net/shutter
2009-02-12T09:25:00.000Z	Wee	rdw200169	I'll tell him to apt-get it, hopefully it's a good solution. thank you for the time :)
2009-02-12T09:26:00.000Z	rdw200169	Wee	it won't be in the repo's, he has to use the PPA's, check the link i gave you, all the instructions are there pertaining to its usage and installation
2009-02-12T09:27:00.000Z	Wee	rdw200169	pardon my ignorance, what's PPA?
2009-02-12T09:28:00.000Z	rdw200169	Wee	personal repositories hosted on launchpad, you add the personal repo to apt, and then it will update correctly, etc...
2009-02-12T09:29:00.000Z	Wee	rdw200169	alright, I'll see what I can do (I'll have to do it for him ;\) thanks for you help and time! good night
2009-02-12T09:30:00.000Z	rdw200169	Wee	well, i tried it, and it works very well; easy too
2009-02-12T09:31:00.000Z	Wee	rdw200169	fantastic, great to hear :) thanks again
