2010-02-05T04:04:00.000Z	archboxman	hyperstation	that is why we use apt-get install program  and program and program
2010-02-05T04:05:00.000Z	archboxman	hyperstation	you want to know location of the .deb files to burn to disk??? yes no

2010-02-05T04:25:00.000Z	archboxman	hyperstation	burn it 2 dvds ... problem solved
2010-02-05T04:27:00.000Z	archboxman	hyperstation	select half the list files and burn to disk... hyperstation are you trying to do this from the command line or in a gui???
2010-02-05T04:28:00.000Z	archboxman	hyperstation	are you playing with the program or the folder location of all the files
2010-02-05T04:30:00.000Z	archboxman	hyperstation	are you in folder with all the tar.gz files are located
2010-02-05T04:34:00.000Z	archboxman	hyperstation	no no no places > my computer > file system > open folders /var /lib /apt /cache select form the list half the files and right click burn to disc should work...
2010-02-05T04:36:00.000Z	archboxman	hyperstation	that is why danbhfive gave you the location to the files so you could select the folder and burn the selected amount should have wrote down the path to the cache and gone to the folder selected half the packages and drag and droped the packages to the program aptoncd
2010-02-05T04:38:00.000Z	archboxman	hyperstation	what are you taking about did you finalize the burn on aptoncd or burn to disc... your confusing me...??? did you burn list to disc
2010-02-05T04:39:00.000Z	archboxman	hyperstation	or is it not letting you burn to disc because you have selected to many files delete half the list and burn to disc.. this is not rocket science you need to learn how to use the program
2010-02-05T04:41:00.000Z	archboxman	hyperstation	great sounds good stop complaining about having to do maintence tasks... every person has same takes ... even me..
