2012-09-08T08:40:00.000Z	subcool		i upgrade, and it died. ALong with my wine, open office, Microsoft office, and well EVERYTHIng i need, when i need it.
2012-09-08T08:40:00.000Z	Sokel	subcool	That's why you don't upgrade. DO a clean install.
2012-09-08T08:40:00.000Z	subcool	Sokel	yea, i know.
2012-09-08T08:42:00.000Z	Sokel	subcool	That's why I have a script to do my 'upgrades'. It does all of the 'restores' after a clean install.
2012-09-08T08:42:00.000Z	subcool		and whats that?
2012-09-08T08:42:00.000Z	subcool		i remember running across some kinda backup- that did the same, when i left mandriva for the SAME reason
2012-09-08T08:43:00.000Z	Sokel	subcool	I build my own scripts.
2012-09-08T08:43:00.000Z	subcool		Something doesnt work, people say upgrade to LTS. I upgrade.. and EVERYTHING goes to hell.
2012-09-08T08:43:00.000Z	subcool		oh- :/
2012-09-08T08:43:00.000Z	Sokel	subcool	NEVER upgrade. Clean installs only.
2012-09-08T08:43:00.000Z	subcool		there use to be something in the old stock apt-get backup or something
2012-09-08T08:43:00.000Z	subcool	Sokel	yea, i know- i was taught that. But everyone says NOW adays they fixed everything.
