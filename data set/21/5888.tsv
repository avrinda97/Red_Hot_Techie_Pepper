2008-03-25T15:18:00.000Z	unop	huy	it's all one command, yes
2008-03-25T15:19:00.000Z	huy	unop	but i got permission denied
2008-03-25T15:21:00.000Z	unop	huy	yea, you can try this -- sudo perl -i.bak -ple 's/RadioState\|1/RadioState\|0/' /etc/ndiswrapper/bcmwl5/*.conf
2008-03-25T16:46:00.000Z	huy	unop	yeah
2008-03-25T16:47:00.000Z	huy	unop	i don't know how to get it back
2008-03-25T16:58:00.000Z	huy	unop	i think i know the problem now. with acpi=off the wireless card is nto associated with irq, so no matterwhat i do, i wont' be able to turn it on
2008-03-25T16:59:00.000Z	huy	unop	i saw that error when i tried ndiswrapper, and i just read that in some forum
2008-03-25T17:00:00.000Z	huy	unop	i may try their tricks to see how that works. no clue, but will try anyway :-D
2008-03-25T17:02:00.000Z	huy	unop	you know how to disable the service cpuspeed?
2008-03-25T17:04:00.000Z	huy	unop	it says command not found
2008-03-25T17:06:00.000Z	huy	unop	it says there's no such file or directory
2008-03-25T19:31:00.000Z	huy	unop	i got it to work
2008-03-26T13:53:00.000Z	huy	unop	hey, thanks for your help last night
2008-03-26T13:53:00.000Z	unop	huy	hmm, was that the broadcom issue?
2008-03-26T13:53:00.000Z	huy	unop	yeah. i found the solution, so simple
2008-03-26T13:54:00.000Z	unop	huy	cool, what was it?
2008-03-26T13:54:00.000Z	huy	unop	acpi=off wouldn't bind ndiswrapper and its driver with irq0. i had to change boot parameter
2008-03-26T13:55:00.000Z	unop	huy	nice, will try and remember that :)
