2005-05-20T12:40:00.000Z	Seveas	Q_Continuum	trekkie?
2005-05-20T12:46:00.000Z	Seveas	Q_Continuum	it's in universe
2005-05-20T12:53:00.000Z	Seveas	Q_Continuum	they'd better do it right and simply fix all before releasing the next beta :)
2005-05-20T12:59:00.000Z	Seveas	Q_Continuum	yes there is
2005-05-20T13:01:00.000Z	Seveas	Q_Continuum	try linux-k7
2005-05-20T13:02:00.000Z	Seveas	Q_Continuum	the others lixe linux-image-k7 are dummy packages needed for smooth upgrades
2005-05-20T13:02:00.000Z	Seveas	Q_Continuum	so if you install linux-k7, it'll seem to install a lot, but actually it doesn't :)
2005-06-17T14:50:00.000Z	Seveas	Q_Continuum	from an xp setup cd choose rescue mode and run fdisk /mbt
2005-06-17T14:50:00.000Z	Q_Continuum	Seveas	I can't.  I secured the administrator account, and it won't let me use the real one.
2005-06-17T14:50:00.000Z	Seveas	Q_Continuum	you cannot use grub if you have no linux install
2005-06-17T14:51:00.000Z	Seveas	Q_Continuum	and you do not need to be windos administrator
2005-06-17T14:51:00.000Z	Q_Continuum	Seveas	off the XP CD you do.
2005-06-17T14:51:00.000Z	Seveas	Q_Continuum	then use a win98 bootdisk :)
2005-06-17T14:52:00.000Z	Seveas	Q_Continuum	that's because the menu is on the ubunto /boot/grub directory, you cannot use grub without it
2005-06-17T14:52:00.000Z	Seveas	Q_Continuum	then use a win98 bootdisk :) <-----
2005-06-17T14:56:00.000Z	Seveas	Q_Continuum	iirc yes...
2005-11-01T06:36:00.000Z	Seveas	Q_Continuum	vga=773 as kernel parameter...
2005-11-01T06:37:00.000Z	Q_Continuum	Seveas	recompile?
2005-11-01T06:37:00.000Z	Seveas	Q_Continuum	no, edit /boot/grub/menu.lst and reboot
2006-01-15T08:36:00.000Z	Seveas	Q_Continuum	breezy is stable and does not receive new versions
