2008-03-22T01:13:00.000Z	BlackChaos		today for some reason ubuntu has been freezing but not for a long time only for like a brief 2-5 seconds and im trying 2 watch a movie but because of this its getting annoying
2008-03-22T01:14:00.000Z	WAKD	BlackChaos	I noticed that as well when I installed the xgl server and turned on compiz. switched all that off and now it works fine. also preload (apt-get install preload) will help.
2008-03-22T01:18:00.000Z	BlackChaos	WAKD	i just installed preload now wat do i do

2008-03-22T01:19:00.000Z	WAKD	BlackChaos	- preload will help speed things up - just leave it along for now - it needs a little while to work out your usage patterns and start helping
