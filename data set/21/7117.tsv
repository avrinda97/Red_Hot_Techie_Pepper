2006-11-27T10:50:00.000Z	Rainarrow		Hi everyone, I have a question about wget here
2006-11-27T10:51:00.000Z	Rainarrow		if I open a terminal, wget something, and then want to wget another file, do I have to open another terminal?
2006-11-27T10:52:00.000Z	trappist	Rainarrow	if I'm wgetting something big, I like to do it in a screen session
2006-11-27T10:53:00.000Z	trappist	Rainarrow	you can foreground a backgrounded process by saying 'fg'
2006-11-27T10:54:00.000Z	Rainarrow	trappist	I've tried the & thing, as you said it doesn't work
2006-11-27T10:54:00.000Z	Rainarrow	trappist	due to the progress bar
2006-11-27T10:55:00.000Z	Rainarrow	trappist	but if I close that terminal while wget is still running, it will continue in the background
2006-11-27T10:55:00.000Z	Rainarrow	trappist	but then if I say fg, it tell me no such job
2006-11-27T10:56:00.000Z	trappist	Rainarrow	could be it's finished?
2006-11-27T10:57:00.000Z	Rainarrow	trappist	I still could see it via ps -x
2006-11-27T10:57:00.000Z	Rainarrow	trappist	and in the STAT column it says "R"
2006-11-27T10:58:00.000Z	trappist	Rainarrow	this is with -nv and &, or in screen?
2006-11-27T10:58:00.000Z	Rainarrow	trappist	I did the following: open a terminal, wget something, and close that terminal, then open another terminal
2006-11-27T10:59:00.000Z	Rainarrow	trappist	and if I run fg in the latter terminal it says "no such job"
2006-11-27T10:59:00.000Z	Rainarrow	trappist	if I run ps -x, I can see wget is still running
2006-11-27T10:59:00.000Z	trappist	Rainarrow	oh no, don't do that.  if you want to be able to close the terminal, say 'nohup wget [options] 
2006-11-27T10:59:00.000Z	trappist	Rainarrow	or use screen
2006-11-27T11:00:00.000Z	Rainarrow	trappist	I see, thx
2006-11-27T11:00:00.000Z	Rainarrow	trappist	why can't I man fg?
2006-11-27T11:01:00.000Z	trappist	Rainarrow	it's not a command, it's a bash builtin.  man bash and search for fg.
2006-11-27T11:01:00.000Z	trappist	Rainarrow	nope
