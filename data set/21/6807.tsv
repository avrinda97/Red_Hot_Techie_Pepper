2007-01-25T12:52:00.000Z	SecrethX	pbureau	do you know something for the Philips Jukebox (or HDD6320) 30G?
2007-01-25T12:52:00.000Z	pbureau	SecrethX	 does your firware indicate if it is MTP or UMS ?
2007-01-25T12:53:00.000Z	pbureau		s/firware/firmware
2007-01-25T12:53:00.000Z	SecrethX	pbureau	not quite sure.. ill look into it
2007-01-25T12:56:00.000Z	pbureau	SecrethX	 the whole issue with MP3 player is that alot of them need to use Windows Player  (using MTP encryption) and linux cannot load/see the drive as a regular USB drive. the way around that (if possible for your model) is to check the european web site for your model and see if they have an MTP-UMS firmware (what I did) and this permits to ubuntu to see/access the mp3 player as a usb drive.
2007-01-25T12:57:00.000Z	SecrethX	pbureau	okay, I understand.. but how can I change the firmware if I dont have any windows available ? ;O
2007-01-25T12:58:00.000Z	pbureau	SecrethX	 well that is the egg-chicken dillema, I have multiple computers so I did not have this issue.. maybe do it from an internet cafe shop
2007-01-25T12:58:00.000Z	SecrethX		hmm ok
2007-01-25T12:58:00.000Z	pbureau		Thundermail has that options as well
2007-01-25T12:58:00.000Z	SecrethX	pbureau	so if they dont have that FirmWare, I have a problem? :o
2007-01-25T12:59:00.000Z	pbureau	SecrethX	basically... yep if you cannot switch to UMS... then nope no linux option
