2007-12-13T06:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nilihanth	blacklist
2007-12-13T06:12:00.000Z	nilihanth	Jack_Sparrow	what is "blacklist"?
2007-12-13T06:12:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nilihanth	not sure if that is what you want but... To blacklist a module, edit /etc/modprobe.d/my_blacklist and add " blacklist <modulename> " to the end of that list -
2007-12-13T06:14:00.000Z	nilihanth	Jack_Sparrow	I dont see a "my_blacklist" file, but I do see a couple others with "blacklist" in the names
2007-12-13T06:15:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nilihanth	Perhaps a description of the probem you are trying to fix..
2007-12-13T06:15:00.000Z	nilihanth	Jack_Sparrow	Ok, I have 2 LAN controllers and one gives me problems but it is the first that the NM wants to connect to.
2007-12-13T06:16:00.000Z	nilihanth	Jack_Sparrow	sometimes it locks up my machine even
2007-12-13T06:16:00.000Z	nilihanth	Jack_Sparrow	I found a file called "blacklist" in /etc/modprobe.d/
2007-12-13T06:16:00.000Z	nilihanth	Jack_Sparrow	it has things like "blacklist snd_intel8x0m" in it...is that what I want?
2007-12-13T06:18:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nilihanth	Yu are in an area I know little about...  here is a link that MAY help.. not sure..  http://www.lockergnome.com/linux/2007/10/24/ubuntu-gutsy-internet-help/
2007-12-13T06:19:00.000Z	nilihanth	Jack_Sparrow	can you quickly tell me how to find out my module's name?
2007-12-13T06:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nilihanth	sorry , I was reading.. you mean like lspci  or lsusb
2007-12-13T06:21:00.000Z	nilihanth	Jack_Sparrow	ok, I did lspci but I cannot tell what the name would be of the module...the name I'd type in "blacklist <name>"
2007-12-13T06:22:00.000Z	nilihanth	Jack_Sparrow	Here is the line from lspci that describes the problematic device...
2007-12-13T06:22:00.000Z	nilihanth	Jack_Sparrow	01:09.0 Ethernet controller: Lite-On Communications Inc LNE100TX [Linksys EtherFast 10/100] (rev 25)

2007-12-13T06:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nilihanth	I am brain dead today...  but yes.. that looks right...
2007-12-13T06:23:00.000Z	nilihanth	Jack_Sparrow	lol, ok I'll try it...thanks!
2007-12-13T06:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nilihanth	make a backup of your old file
