2006-09-24T10:55:00.000Z	MNGRVE		i accidentally installed the win32 version of flash
2006-09-24T10:55:00.000Z	ArrenLex	MNGRVE	Just go to the Extensions screen and click uninstall.
2006-09-24T10:55:00.000Z	MNGRVE	ArrenLex	it's not an extension
2006-09-24T10:56:00.000Z	ArrenLex	MNGRVE	Oh. It's in your ~/.mozilla/plugins
2006-09-24T10:56:00.000Z	MNGRVE		thanks :D
2006-09-24T10:56:00.000Z	ArrenLex	MNGRVE	Remove the files libflashplayer.so and flashplayer.xpt
2006-09-24T10:56:00.000Z	ArrenLex	MNGRVE	I don't know how you can "accidentally" install the wrong version of Flash, though, because there's only one version of Flash.
2006-09-24T10:57:00.000Z	MNGRVE	ArrenLex	wine+wrong link = no
2006-09-24T10:57:00.000Z	ArrenLex		burner: then it probably won't work. At least not without a lot of hacking.
2006-09-24T10:57:00.000Z	ArrenLex		burner: you can check out the synce project on http://synce.sf.net
2006-09-24T10:58:00.000Z	ArrenLex		burner: synce is for syncing PDAs. It warns that it most often won't work on smartphones. My own smartphone didn't work with it.
2006-09-24T10:58:00.000Z	ArrenLex		burner: try it though. Maybe magical things might happen.
2006-09-24T10:58:00.000Z	ArrenLex		F.: could you please change your name?
2006-09-24T10:58:00.000Z	ArrenLex		jason: More framerate in what?
2006-09-24T11:00:00.000Z	ArrenLex		burner: you can't use activesync with wine.
2006-09-24T11:00:00.000Z	MNGRVE		can someone tell me where to get a lot of video codecs?
2006-09-24T11:00:00.000Z	ArrenLex		burner: activesync requires a driver. wine does not do drivers. It's strictly API.
2006-09-24T11:00:00.000Z	ArrenLex		burner: ys.
2006-09-24T11:00:00.000Z	ArrenLex		yes
2006-09-24T11:01:00.000Z	ArrenLex	MNGRVE	download w32codecs from the mplayer page and put them in /usr/lib/win32
