2012-04-26T21:45:00.000Z	danel__		well let's take it slowly

2012-04-26T21:46:00.000Z	danel__		log in as super user

2012-04-26T21:46:00.000Z	danel__		floodbot 1 huh? didn't know I was flooding
2012-04-26T21:46:00.000Z	danel__		don't use sudo su?
2012-04-26T21:46:00.000Z	danel__		what is wrong with being root?
2012-04-26T21:47:00.000Z	upset	danel__	It is better to write a longer set of instructions or pastebin it
2012-04-26T21:47:00.000Z	upset	danel__	It is flooding if you post without being concise
2012-04-26T21:47:00.000Z	upset	danel__	really? Ew.
2012-04-26T21:48:00.000Z	upset	danel__	Hard to address someone when you don't address theme
2012-04-26T21:49:00.000Z	upset	danel__	Look man, this is a support channel. People grab a smart buddy and talk to them extensively about a problem. We're not all reading everyone else's conversation
2012-04-26T21:53:00.000Z	upset	danel__	Yeah, but it's your responsibility to not throw around sudo su like it's a great idea
2012-04-26T21:53:00.000Z	danel__	upset	roger then
2012-04-26T21:53:00.000Z	upset	danel__	Ok
2012-04-26T21:54:00.000Z	upset	danel__	Huh?
2012-04-26T21:54:00.000Z	upset	danel__	Blame other distros. Or gentoo users. Let's blame gentoo users.
2012-04-26T21:57:00.000Z	upset	danel__	Again, you are not talking to the room. You ask your question, someone grabs you, and you talk to them. We will not all work to solve your issue, only one or two volunteer to help
