2005-05-27T10:32:00.000Z	bob2	whyameye	right click on the gnome panel, add applet, add the network one
2005-05-27T10:33:00.000Z	whyameye	bob2	what is the gnome panel? (sorry to be such a newbie)
2005-05-27T10:34:00.000Z	bob2	whyameye	the thing at the top with the clock, find a blank area and right click on it
2005-07-22T13:04:00.000Z	bob2	whyameye	nowhere, in general
2005-07-22T13:05:00.000Z	whyameye	bob2	so how can I find out how much disk space I have used and have available?
2005-07-22T13:05:00.000Z	bob2	whyameye	'df -h' will show both values for each mounted partition
2005-09-07T08:54:00.000Z	bob2	whyameye	cp -a, or tar, or rsync
2005-09-07T08:59:00.000Z	whyameye	bob2	thanks. I went with cp -a and it's working great!
2005-09-07T09:13:00.000Z	bob2	whyameye	it's unkillable then
2005-09-07T09:13:00.000Z	whyameye	bob2	the unkillable process is a disk read. Now I can't access the disk... The disk is damaged, BTW....
2005-09-07T09:14:00.000Z	bob2	whyameye	yeah, then you're screwed
2005-09-07T09:14:00.000Z	bob2	whyameye	the kernel ca't beat bad hardware
2005-09-07T09:14:00.000Z	whyameye	bob2	I'm just surprised it doesn't at some point give up and just report a read error...
2005-09-07T09:14:00.000Z	bob2	whyameye	it might eventually
2005-09-07T09:15:00.000Z	whyameye	bob2	it's been easily 15 min... This is a bummer. 70gig of ntfs crap. Most of it is readable...and then this happens when I try to copy it to a clean disk...
2005-09-07T09:16:00.000Z	bob2	whyameye	eep
2005-09-07T09:19:00.000Z	whyameye	bob2	it just came back! So...is there a way to reduce the number of read retries before reporting back failure?
2005-09-07T09:19:00.000Z	bob2	whyameye	hm, I don't know, sorry
2005-09-30T09:45:00.000Z	whyameye	bob2	any way you could help me troubleshoot a samba network printing problem?
2005-09-30T09:45:00.000Z	bob2	whyameye	it's 0145, sorry
2005-09-30T09:46:00.000Z	whyameye	bob2	okay. Yep. Get some sleep. Thanks for responding.
