2004-10-30T11:20:00.000Z	JStrik1	Mitario	: Actually wanting to speak to to you about your package upgrade proposal. BTW, do use a different nick in #g-h? I have never seen you before
2004-10-30T11:20:00.000Z	Mitario	JStrik1	no, #g-h is also Mitario :)
2004-10-30T11:21:00.000Z	JStrik1	Mitario	: Ah. I see you now :-)
2004-10-30T11:22:00.000Z	Mitario	JStrik1	well, say wat you wan to say :)
2004-10-30T11:23:00.000Z	JStrik1	Mitario	: Ok. I have been wanting to create a new frontend for package upgrades. Synaptic is hideous and red-carpet is too enterprise specific. Something is needed. Yours is somewhat better
2004-10-30T11:23:00.000Z	Mitario	JStrik1	i'm just finishing a new draft of my proposal, i'll put it in my weblog ASAP
2004-10-30T11:24:00.000Z	Mitario	JStrik1	every idea is welcome of course
2004-10-30T11:24:00.000Z	JStrik1	Mitario	: But I do not see why a user would ever need to know about a system library. Whether to install it or upgrade it, he should never have to know what the hell libgnomeui is etc
2004-10-30T11:25:00.000Z	JStrik1	Mitario	: Any chance you are creating it with Mono? If so, I will happily help out
2004-10-30T11:27:00.000Z	Mitario	JStrik1	i'm creating my mockups with ruby, i have not yet decided which language i'm going to use for the real stuff
2004-10-30T11:29:00.000Z	JStrik1	Mitario	: They should only ever be presented with Application Names. Not sure if Linspire is similar, but it does sound like they do hide the cruft away
2004-10-30T11:30:00.000Z	Mitario	JStrik1	ah
2004-10-30T11:37:00.000Z	Mitario	JStrik1	but why woudn't you want to list libraries as an update?
2004-10-30T11:37:00.000Z	Mitario	JStrik1	I want to see the updates of all packages actually
2004-10-30T11:39:00.000Z	JStrik1	Mitario	: Why should someone be made aware that they have libgnomeui installed? Abiword ? Yes. libgnomeui? No 
2004-10-30T11:39:00.000Z	Mitario	JStrik1	and why not, as a developer, I would be really pleased to know that for example libgnomeui is updated
2004-10-30T11:40:00.000Z	JStrik1	Mitario	: But are developers the Gnome target audience? (Well, kinda, but you know what I mean)
2004-10-30T11:41:00.000Z	Mitario	JStrik1	ok, say, my father, is a windows user, what is the harm that he know that libgnomeui is installed?
2004-10-30T11:44:00.000Z	JStrik1	Mitario	: But, maybe I misunderstood what you were aiming for. I want to do a replacement for synaptic that sane as well as have an update utility
2004-10-30T11:44:00.000Z	JStrik1	Mitario	: When he tries to install it, the package management app will retrieve it in the backaground
2004-10-30T11:44:00.000Z	Mitario	JStrik1	my first goal was to create a nice update installation thingy, not a replacement for the package manager :)
