2011-11-06T03:12:00.000Z	dr3mro		hello ihave ubuntu and i want to get list of files on my system that are not on the apt-get .. that means installed but without apt like compiled or any file created on my system and not in apt
2011-11-06T03:13:00.000Z	reisio	dr3mro	you'd have to diff a list of all files and the output of dpkg -L for each package
2011-11-06T03:14:00.000Z	dr3mro	reisio	I want a more automated method to check my system for files that aren't on apt
2011-11-06T03:14:00.000Z	reisio	dr3mro	there should be nothing on your system that didn't come from apt except for files in /home/, and files you personally put places
2011-11-06T03:15:00.000Z	reisio	dr3mro	to be completely sure you'd need to use something like AIDE, but you would need to have been using it from immediately after your installation for it to be full proof
2011-11-06T03:16:00.000Z	reisio	dr3mro	you'd have to determine the files from the deb, or do a diff as I already explained
2011-11-06T03:17:00.000Z	dr3mro	reisio	how to list files in all packages on my system ?
2011-11-06T03:18:00.000Z	reisio	dr3mro	the only way I know of is to loop dpkg -L for every result of dpkg -l (lowercase l there)
2011-11-06T03:18:00.000Z	reisio	dr3mro	someone else might know a better way
2011-11-06T03:57:00.000Z	reisio	dr3mro	?
2011-11-06T03:58:00.000Z	reisio	dr3mro	AIDE already does this
2011-11-06T04:01:00.000Z	reisio	dr3mro	it sounds like you'd like AIDE
2012-05-30T07:25:00.000Z	reisio	dr3mro	from a running system?
2012-05-30T07:25:00.000Z	dr3mro	reisio	YUP!
2012-05-30T07:26:00.000Z	reisio	dr3mro	you can do it with a simple tar command, but there are sections you'll need to exclude
2012-05-30T07:26:00.000Z	dr3mro	reisio	I know about that but wouldn't it be gr8 if a script can do it automatically and restores it if needed!!
2012-05-30T07:27:00.000Z	reisio	dr3mro	it'd have to be a pretty smart script to know when needed
2012-05-30T07:27:00.000Z	reisio	dr3mro	automatically is as simple as making a cron job
2012-05-30T07:27:00.000Z	reisio	dr3mro	although for incremental backups and other fancy things you'd want to use something like rdiff-backup
2012-05-30T07:27:00.000Z	dr3mro	reisio	I mean manually !!
2012-06-01T20:29:00.000Z	reisio	dr3mro	#compiz
