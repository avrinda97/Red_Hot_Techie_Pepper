2010-04-09T12:58:00.000Z	ikonia	MailGon	the TOC needs to be re-read
2010-04-09T12:58:00.000Z	ikonia	MailGon	please control your language
2010-04-09T12:58:00.000Z	ikonia	MailGon	use windows to format windows partitions
2010-04-09T12:58:00.000Z	ikonia	MailGon	using Linux to make a 3rd party closed source file system is not a good idea
2010-04-09T12:58:00.000Z	ikonia	MailGon	why not ?
2010-04-09T12:59:00.000Z	ikonia	MailGon	the installer will format the partition
2010-04-09T12:59:00.000Z	ikonia	MailGon	yes it will
2010-04-09T12:59:00.000Z	ikonia	MailGon	you do know you need two partitions to install windows, and it's fussy - it wants the first partition on the disk
2010-04-09T13:00:00.000Z	ikonia	MailGon	that makes no difference to what I've said
2010-04-09T13:00:00.000Z	ikonia	MailGon	re-read what I've said, Windows wants two partitions, one at the start of the disk for the temporary space
2010-04-09T13:01:00.000Z	ikonia	MailGon	the guys in ##windows will be able to give you the correct requirements for your windows OS
