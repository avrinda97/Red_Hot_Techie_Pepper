2010-10-18T00:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	codydbgt	What is the output of "sudo os-prober"?
2010-10-18T00:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	codydbgt	Good, then "sudo update-grub" should add an entry for it.
2010-10-18T01:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	codydbgt	That appears to be the only bootable windows partition you have. Did you by any chance delete any small ntfs partitions recently?

2010-10-18T01:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	codydbgt	Could you run boot info script as explained here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1291280 and *pastebin* the RESULTS.txt using http://pastebin.ubuntu.com ?
2010-10-18T01:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	codydbgt	I saw it the first time.
2010-10-18T01:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	codydbgt	sda3 is not a bootable windows partition (it does not have a /boot/bcd).
2010-10-18T01:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	codydbgt	You'd have to ask in ##windows (or re-install windows).

2010-10-18T01:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	codydbgt	You already have grub2 installed.
2010-10-18T01:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	codydbgt	Yes, there is one on this network: ##windows.
2010-10-18T01:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	codydbgt	That is to show that the channel is not affiliated with Microsoft, whereas #ubuntu is an official Ubuntu channel.
2010-10-18T01:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	codydbgt	You are on an irc network, freenode, which contains many support channels. Currently you are in the #ubuntu channel on freenode, if you type "/join ##windows" you will join the windows support channel on freenode.
