2010-11-07T10:57:00.000Z	newshades		Hello
2010-11-07T10:59:00.000Z	newshades		I screwed up! I remove some software rebooted and it will not allow me to relog in
2010-11-07T10:59:00.000Z	chicognu	newshades	did you remember what software you remove ?
2010-11-07T11:02:00.000Z	chicognu	newshades	and If you don't have a recovery mode in you grub, boot trough the cd/dvd, and mount the / of you install and chroot then use apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2010-11-07T11:04:00.000Z	chicognu	newshades	 try that from the live cd sudo su  mkdir system mount / system chroot system/ apt-get install desktop
2010-11-07T11:04:00.000Z	chicognu	newshades	 my bad
2010-11-07T11:05:00.000Z	chicognu	newshades	 mkdir system mount /your_system_partition system that is the right comand
2010-11-07T11:07:00.000Z	chicognu	newshades	wierd, lets did it step by step
2010-11-07T11:08:00.000Z	chicognu	newshades	step by step, first sudo su
2010-11-07T11:09:00.000Z	chicognu	newshades	anyerror ?
2010-11-07T11:09:00.000Z	chicognu	newshades	anyerror ?
2010-11-07T11:10:00.000Z	chicognu	newshades	no, you can do it anywhere
2010-11-07T11:10:00.000Z	chicognu	newshades	after sudo su, run: mkdir system (or anyother name you want to use)
2010-11-07T11:12:00.000Z	chicognu	newshades	 then mount /yousystemdev like /dev/sda1 if you system are installed in /dev/sda1 system
2010-11-07T11:13:00.000Z	chicognu	newshades	now u need only run chroot system and and you be like you are rooted to you old system ....
2010-11-07T11:14:00.000Z	chicognu	newshades	 after all that you need only to run apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2010-11-07T11:18:00.000Z	chicognu	newshades	 no need at all to reinstall
2010-11-07T11:18:00.000Z	chicognu	newshades	you mean, reinstall all the system ?
2010-11-07T11:20:00.000Z	chicognu	newshades	 one tip, if you don't already know it. If you reinstall separet at least you /home from others partitions, this way you will be able to format you system how manytimes you want to, without lost personal data
2010-11-07T11:24:00.000Z	chicognu	newshades	yes, the live cd allows you to do anything in any folder of you harddrive, of course if the folder is not encrypted
2010-11-07T11:40:00.000Z	chicognu	newshades	 you are chrooted in you old partition ?
