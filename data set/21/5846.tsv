2007-07-23T09:01:00.000Z	xanith		Anyone got a second to help me out with an ubuntu-server problem?
2007-07-23T09:02:00.000Z	xanith		Okay, I work for a Web Development company, and we have 2 servers running linux
2007-07-23T09:02:00.000Z	xanith		Just recently, the servers started displaying apostrophes as a black diamond with a white question mark in it
2007-07-23T09:02:00.000Z	xanith		We've never had this problem before, and these websites have been running for months with no changes

2007-07-23T09:03:00.000Z	xanith		The sites are using charset UTF-8 as they always have been. I don't know why this problem all of a sudden?
2007-07-23T09:04:00.000Z	xanith		An example of it's doing can be viewed here, http://www.mediathoroughbredgroup.com/blog/index.php/category/horse-racing-trivia/
2007-07-23T09:06:00.000Z	moonlite_	xanith	i'd guess that the problem is someone edited the pages and saved them as iso-8859-1
2007-07-23T09:07:00.000Z	xanith	moonlite_	I do most of the coding here, and I know that I always hardcode UTF-8 and XHTML 1.0 Strict
2007-07-23T09:07:00.000Z	moonlite_	xanith	what dou you mean by "hardcode"?
2007-07-23T09:07:00.000Z	xanith	moonlite_	I specifically input to use charset UTF-8 and specify that document type to XHTML 1.0 Strict with the W3C link...
2007-07-23T09:08:00.000Z	moonlite_	xanith	does notepad save as utf8?
2007-07-23T09:10:00.000Z	moonlite_	xanith	you don't seem to understand what i mean. Notepad doesn't offer you the possibility to encode the file you're saving as utf-8, only iso8859-1
2007-07-23T09:11:00.000Z	xanith	moonlite_	some of these sites are also programed in dreamweaver, not using the visual, visual tab is a BIG NO NO here, we always use the coding tab...
2007-07-23T09:11:00.000Z	xanith	moonlite_	and these sites as well have this problem
2007-07-23T09:12:00.000Z	moonlite_	xanith	well then dreamweaver might also be encoding the pages as latin1?
2007-07-23T09:13:00.000Z	moonlite_	xanith	you should probably ask the hosting company then. :)
2007-07-23T09:16:00.000Z	moonlite_	xanith	umm what information? You have a problem with their servers all of a sudden not showing your pages like they should. Ofcourse you should get help, or otherwise your hosting company isn't worrth much.
2007-07-23T09:17:00.000Z	xanith	moonlite_	lol no no, ok we have servers here that we use for offering hosting to our clients... because we do web development. our servers have the issue, when i moved one of our sites to my personal server that i have through another hosting company for my personal portfolio, the problem was solved. i don't know what they are doing that we aren't...
2007-07-23T09:18:00.000Z	moonlite_	xanith	oh ok. You'll have to go through some trial and error-process then i suppose. Good luck!
