2010-10-20T18:04:00.000Z	cablop		from a week to now it is not resuming on hibernation, but that was working
2010-10-20T18:04:00.000Z	cablop		same release, 10.04,
2010-10-20T18:05:00.000Z	cablop		now it just says that it finds the suspend state on the swap, then clear it, then fsck my partitions and... and that's stupid!
2010-10-20T18:06:00.000Z	cablop		any help in solvind the resume thing would be highly appreciated
2010-10-20T18:08:00.000Z	cablop		ok... it seems there≈õ no way to solve the hibernation issue
2010-10-20T18:08:00.000Z	cablop		it was working before, i don't know what happens to it now!
2010-10-20T18:08:00.000Z	cablop		sigh
2010-10-20T18:09:00.000Z	gartral	cablop	what's the problem?
2010-10-20T18:12:00.000Z	cablop	gartral	any suggestion? :(
2010-10-20T18:21:00.000Z	gartral	cablop	what kind of hard drive is it?
2010-10-20T18:23:00.000Z	cablop	gartral	it is a sata drive, for a netbook, and some partitions are encrypted, well, two partitions on top of an lvm, but swap is not encrypted
2010-10-20T18:25:00.000Z	gartral	cablop	and you told the kernel to use swap part for hibernation, not the ./hiber file?
2010-10-20T18:26:00.000Z	cablop	gartral	well, i said nothing to kernel... cause it was working well the last months... i mean it was working by efault... now it refuse to work well :(
2010-10-20T18:26:00.000Z	gartral	cablop	10.10, yeA?
2010-10-20T18:27:00.000Z	cablop	gartral	nope, 10.04 but with the latest kernel from lucid-updates
2010-10-20T18:33:00.000Z	gartral	cablop	reboot, select the previous kernel, and try the hibernation again (selecting the same kernel on reload) and if it works, submit a bug, then make the Jump to 10.10
2010-10-20T18:35:00.000Z	cablop	gartral	not willing to move to 10.10, but i'll do the test you are suggesting
2010-10-20T18:36:00.000Z	gartral	cablop	10.10 is really *really* *REALLY* nice
2010-10-20T18:45:00.000Z	cablop	gartral	but that breaks the purpose of the LTS...
2010-10-20T20:08:00.000Z	cablop	gartral	get to solve it in a very dirty way
2010-10-20T20:09:00.000Z	cablop	gartral	i set resume=/dev/blablabla in my /etc/default/grub.... lol
