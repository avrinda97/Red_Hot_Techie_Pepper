2010-04-13T07:01:00.000Z	genii	hiexpo	Good, thanks.
2010-04-13T07:02:00.000Z	hiexpo	genii	 - sometimes the monotony needs to be brake i been here for 3 years now
2010-04-21T09:06:00.000Z	genii	hiexpo	dpkg --get-selections > mypackages && gedit mypackages              from there just print it like any normal document
2010-04-21T09:10:00.000Z	genii	hiexpo	If you compiled them into deb packages it will show them.
2010-04-21T09:11:00.000Z	genii	hiexpo	There is no real way to get a comprehensive list of stuff you have installed by compiling with something like make install where it puts them directly into the filesystem
2010-04-21T09:11:00.000Z	hiexpo	genii	 - but like if i installed sh packages they don't and i know one i have installed that was a tar is not showing and its there and runs
2010-04-21T09:12:00.000Z	hiexpo	genii	oh ok
2010-04-21T09:13:00.000Z	genii	hiexpo	One of the points of having a packaging system is to be able to track what's installed. when you do make install or such it bypasses the package manager's ability to track it.
2010-04-21T09:14:00.000Z	hiexpo	genii	 - true but many apps are not available in the repos so onemost install other ways ya know
2010-04-21T09:14:00.000Z	genii	hiexpo	If you look in the file ~/.bash_history it will have a record of commands you have recently typed in. You may find at least some of them there if you find something like: cd prog-name   then: make and: make install      etc
2010-04-21T09:15:00.000Z	genii	hiexpo	Otherwise it is up to you to keep good records of what you manually install
2010-04-21T09:15:00.000Z	hiexpo	genii	ya i know i was just tring an easy way out because i am recopiling a new cd
