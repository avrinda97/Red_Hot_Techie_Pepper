2005-07-23T09:55:00.000Z	Mechcozmo		(almost happened once.... not good)
2005-07-23T09:55:00.000Z	kevogod	Mechcozmo	There should be no problem.
2005-07-23T09:56:00.000Z	kevogod	Mechcozmo	It is text-based, but simple.
2005-07-23T09:58:00.000Z	kevogod	Mechcozmo	I assume you are going to format one of those FAT32 partitions as EXT3?
2005-07-23T09:59:00.000Z	kevogod	Mechcozmo	You will have to choose a partition to format for Ubuntu.
2005-07-23T09:59:00.000Z	Mechcozmo	kevogod	I'll assume that is easy to do and when started into XP nothing will happen to it?
2005-07-23T09:59:00.000Z	kevogod	Mechcozmo	Windows XP will work fine.
2005-07-23T10:01:00.000Z	kevogod	Mechcozmo	Yes, it is.
2005-07-23T10:01:00.000Z	kevogod	Mechcozmo	I was just saying you could install Windows second.
2005-07-23T10:02:00.000Z	kevogod	Mechcozmo	Yes.
2005-07-23T10:04:00.000Z	kevogod	Mechcozmo	Format as in what?
2005-07-23T10:06:00.000Z	kevogod	Mechcozmo	It should work fine.
