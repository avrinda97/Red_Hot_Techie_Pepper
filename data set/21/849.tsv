2011-05-19T01:45:00.000Z	Dingo		but adding it to Startup Applications doesn't do it
2011-05-19T01:46:00.000Z	aaaaalex	Dingo	you could have it executed from /etc/rc.local
2011-05-19T01:48:00.000Z	Dingo	aaaaalex	and what would I add to rc.local "./my/path/program" ?
2011-05-19T01:49:00.000Z	aaaaalex	Dingo	/full/path/to/program ;-)
2011-05-19T01:49:00.000Z	Dingo	aaaaalex	thanks :)
2011-05-19T01:51:00.000Z	aaaaalex	Dingo	make sure its executable
2011-05-19T01:52:00.000Z	Dingo	aaaaalex	yeah, I chmodded it +x
2011-05-19T01:52:00.000Z	Dingo	aaaaalex	so I don't need to put a period in front of it?
2011-05-19T01:53:00.000Z	aaaaalex	Dingo	no - you are starting from / not from some current directory ;-)
2011-05-19T01:55:00.000Z	aaaaalex	Dingo	if the program lives in your home directory for example it would be /home/yourusername/programname
2011-05-19T01:55:00.000Z	Dingo	aaaaalex	ah, k,  thanks for the clear explanation :)
2011-05-19T01:56:00.000Z	aaaaalex	Dingo	/etc/rc.local is run by root so be carefull what your program does :-D
2011-05-19T01:56:00.000Z	Dingo	aaaaalex	*
2011-05-19T02:00:00.000Z	Dingo	aaaaalex	it didn't start :/
2011-05-19T02:03:00.000Z	Dingo	aaaaalex	the program itself?
2011-05-19T02:03:00.000Z	Dingo	aaaaalex	yes
2011-05-19T02:04:00.000Z	Dingo	aaaaalex	it runs, and does what it should do, it's a C++ application btw
2011-05-19T02:05:00.000Z	aaaaalex	Dingo	no. it just needs to be executable by root and the path needs to be correct - oh and the program of course
2011-05-19T02:06:00.000Z	Dingo	aaaaalex	I added it right before the exit 0 statement
2011-05-19T02:06:00.000Z	aaaaalex	Dingo	yes. this always works for me :-D
2011-05-19T02:09:00.000Z	Dingo	aaaaalex	sorry, closed my command line
