2012-04-20T22:50:00.000Z	MrElendig	angels	seperate /home is strongly encuraged
2012-04-20T22:51:00.000Z	MrElendig	angels	less chance of losing all your data if something goes wrong, also much easier to handle reinstalls etc
2012-04-20T22:52:00.000Z	MrElendig	angels	what is your existing layout, and do you have data you want to keep on any of the partitions?
2012-04-20T22:54:00.000Z	angels	MrElendig	ldiamond - it is a blank 1TB. I formatted 400GB to ext4, which is sitting in the middle of the drive.  I need to mark the 400GB partition with / from which program?
2012-04-20T22:54:00.000Z	MrElendig	angels	if it is totally blank then I suggests this:
2012-04-20T22:55:00.000Z	MrElendig	angels	100 mb /boot, 20gb /, 2xram swap and the rest for /home
2012-04-20T22:55:00.000Z	MrElendig	angels	asuming you are not going to dualboot anything on that disk
2012-04-20T22:55:00.000Z	MrElendig	angels	and use gpt :)
2012-04-20T22:56:00.000Z	angels	MrElendig	- I can dual boot 2 Linux (or Windows & Linux) at same time? I was told that's not possible
2012-04-20T22:56:00.000Z	MrElendig	angels	you can have a menu to choose which to boot at start
2012-04-20T22:56:00.000Z	MrElendig	angels	you can't really run both at the same time
2012-04-20T22:57:00.000Z	angels	MrElendig	- where am I supposed to put in those items you mentioned?
2012-04-20T22:57:00.000Z	MrElendig	angels	btw if you are going to install windows on the disk, do that first
2012-04-20T22:57:00.000Z	MrElendig	angels	and just leave some unpartitioned space to install ubuntu on
2012-04-20T22:58:00.000Z	angels	MrElendig	- my only concern is a Windows trojan/rootkit crossing over to Linux on the drive... that is not possible is it, even if the Windows drive is mounted?
2012-04-20T22:58:00.000Z	MrElendig	angels	a trojan written for windows would not run on gnu/linux
2012-04-20T22:59:00.000Z	angels	MrElendig	- so I should use GParted again to add an NFTS partition first?
2012-04-20T22:59:00.000Z	MrElendig	angels	no
2012-04-20T23:00:00.000Z	MrElendig	angels	if you are going to have windows on the same disk, just run the windows installer first, and just give it 100gb or whatever you need for apps+games
2012-04-20T23:00:00.000Z	MrElendig	angels	leave the rest of the space as unpartitioned
2012-04-20T23:12:00.000Z	MrElendig	angels	take a look at tldp and the ubuntu install guides
