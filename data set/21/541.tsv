2011-10-19T08:48:00.000Z	TerryA		in firefox, goto edit, preferences, application
2011-10-19T08:49:00.000Z	TerryA		go down to AVI and open the rollup in the right collumn, and you have the option to open it in fire fox or just in totem
2011-10-19T08:49:00.000Z	TerryA		default is to open it in sirefox
2011-10-19T08:49:00.000Z	TerryA		firefox
2011-10-19T08:50:00.000Z	TerryA		did that fix it for you stephni?
2011-10-19T08:51:00.000Z	TerryA		justice, same here, but its not just a program, mu NIC keep failing since an update, but on 2 different computers
2011-10-19T08:52:00.000Z	TerryA		newwork adapter, i keep loosing all network access afer a minute or so, and have to reboot to get it up again
2011-10-19T08:54:00.000Z	TerryA		is anyone able to help me with my network issue?
2011-10-19T08:56:00.000Z	TerryA		i doubt its driver specific
2011-10-19T08:56:00.000Z	cajunspice	TerryA	what are the exact symptoms?
2011-10-19T08:57:00.000Z	cajunspice	TerryA	can you ping?
2011-10-19T08:58:00.000Z	cajunspice	TerryA	what kind of lan/cabling situation?
2011-10-19T09:00:00.000Z	cajunspice	TerryA	after the net dies and you can't ping out, does your hub's activity lights indicate that the hib sees the ping attempts?
2011-10-19T09:04:00.000Z	cajunspice	TerryA	so the problem is in the receiving ... are you running half-duplex or full-duplex?
2011-10-19T09:06:00.000Z	cajunspice	TerryA	the update might have switched the default for the ethernet cards to full-duplex, which is only fine if oyu have a compatible full-duplex hub
2011-10-19T09:08:00.000Z	cajunspice	TerryA	trying to run full-duplex on a half-duplex lan will do just what's happening to you, things will run great for a little while
2011-10-19T09:14:00.000Z	cajunspice	TerryA	try setting it to half-duplex then
2011-10-19T09:21:00.000Z	cajunspice	TerryA	you need to be root
2011-10-19T09:23:00.000Z	cajunspice	TerryA	if ethtool won't do it, you can always try hand-editting the config files
2011-10-19T09:33:00.000Z	cajunspice	TerryA	any luck?
