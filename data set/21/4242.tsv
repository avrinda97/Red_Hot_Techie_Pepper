2009-05-13T18:46:00.000Z	Issa	erUSUL	thanks :) I think it's starting, but all I see so far is black page! I also have installed fluxbox and openbox, how would I choose which to start?
2009-05-13T18:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	Issa	that depneds on hwat you specify in ~/.xinitrc file... also you may want to install xdm so you can log graphically
2009-05-13T18:47:00.000Z	Issa	erUSUL	oh blackbox is started, but still need to know how to choose between the different *box WMs
2009-05-13T18:48:00.000Z	Issa	erUSUL	what is the .xinitrc for
2009-05-13T18:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	Issa	it specifys what programs run when you run startx
2009-05-13T18:48:00.000Z	Issa	erUSUL	oh great, thanks.
2009-05-13T18:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	Issa	you can put there what WM you want
2009-05-13T18:49:00.000Z	erUSUL	Issa	and other programs to launch
2009-05-13T18:49:00.000Z	Issa	erUSUL	what is the difference between this then and /etc/rc.local ?
2009-05-13T18:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	Issa	rc.local is run qhen the computer boots... things on xinitrc are only run when you run startx
2009-05-13T18:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	Issa	man startx
2009-05-13T18:50:00.000Z	Issa	erUSUL	ok cool! but I don't see the file .xinitrc, do I have to create it?
2009-05-13T18:50:00.000Z	Issa	erUSUL	ok
2009-05-13T18:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	Issa	yes if you want to costumize it
2009-05-13T18:52:00.000Z	Issa	erUSUL	does rc.local run as root at boot?
2009-05-13T18:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	Issa	yes
2009-05-13T18:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	Issa	you can not run startx from rc.local if that's what you are thinking...
2009-05-13T18:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	Issa	if you want to log in graphically install xdm
2009-05-13T18:54:00.000Z	Issa	erUSUL	ok thanks :)
2009-05-13T18:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	Issa	no problem
