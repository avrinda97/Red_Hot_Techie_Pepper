2011-01-29T11:27:00.000Z	lewix		thats unbelievable how linux became so user-friendly over the years
2011-01-29T11:27:00.000Z	lewix		me is reminiscing back in the days
2011-01-29T11:28:00.000Z	judgepg	lewix	early days of slackware? :)
2011-01-29T11:29:00.000Z	lewix	judgepg	I remember the first time i installed linux (debian) it took me the entire day, today it took me about 20min
2011-01-29T11:29:00.000Z	judgepg	lewix	if you still want to relive those days, install linux from scratch :)
2011-01-29T11:30:00.000Z	judgepg	lewix	I remember that as well
2011-01-29T11:30:00.000Z	lewix	judgepg	no thank you...although linux changed over time I didnt. Im still pretty much clueless
2011-01-29T11:33:00.000Z	judgepg	lewix	lol

2011-01-29T11:51:00.000Z	lewix	judgepg	what struck me was the possibility to install ubuntu right from windows like a regular windows app
2011-01-29T11:52:00.000Z	judgepg	lewix	we talking abotu wubi?
2011-01-29T11:52:00.000Z	lewix	judgepg	right wubi.

2011-01-29T11:55:00.000Z	lewix	judgepg	what movie player do you use
2011-01-29T11:56:00.000Z	judgepg	lewix	vlc, but mplayer is also really good, yep
2011-01-29T11:57:00.000Z	lewix	judgepg	im trying to download vlc but its taking forever . my connection died for some unknown reasons so Im using someone else's....the generous guy is pronbably living 5miles away
