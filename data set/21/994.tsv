2011-03-12T07:48:00.000Z	Cody3290		UsingGParted, if i delete a partition, does th space automatically get redistributed?
2011-03-12T07:49:00.000Z	Cody3290		So, what happens to the space?
2011-03-12T07:49:00.000Z	Cody3290		It disappears?
2011-03-12T07:50:00.000Z	Cody3290		Ok. Lets say I want to install XP, and HTEN ubuntu, but I already have both on my disc. Can I format  the entire disc? If so, how? Can I just delete all the partitions and it will make one giant unallocated spot?
2011-03-12T07:50:00.000Z	Cody3290		I'm on a LiveCD, btw
2011-03-12T07:51:00.000Z	Cody3290		How di I format my drive?
2011-03-12T07:52:00.000Z	bazhang	Cody3290	to install ubuntu?
2011-03-12T07:52:00.000Z	bazhang	Cody3290	use the xp installer, then the ubuntu one
2011-03-12T07:52:00.000Z	bazhang	Cody3290	using windows? or gparted?
2011-03-12T07:55:00.000Z	bazhang	Cody3290	mount the partitions then delete them
2011-03-12T07:56:00.000Z	bazhang	Cody3290	yes
2011-03-12T07:57:00.000Z	Cody3290	bazhang	When I press delete on them, nothing happens
2011-03-12T07:57:00.000Z	bazhang	Cody3290	be sure they are mounted; you really are better off doing this with the windows installer disk
2011-03-12T08:04:00.000Z	bazhang	Cody3290	what does that do
2011-03-12T08:05:00.000Z	bazhang	Cody3290	sudo lshw
2011-03-12T08:05:00.000Z	bazhang	Cody3290	not really needed for ubuntu though
2011-03-12T08:05:00.000Z	bazhang	Cody3290	the additional drivers will check that
2011-03-12T08:06:00.000Z	Cody3290	bazhang	what do you mean?
2011-03-12T08:07:00.000Z	bazhang	Cody3290	system administration additional drivers for the various propietary software drivers
2011-03-12T08:17:00.000Z	bazhang	Cody3290	russian
