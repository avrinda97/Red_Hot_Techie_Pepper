2007-08-16T06:59:00.000Z	gvsa123		mindspark: they have an application that only works for windows. man! but it's good. so my next question is which is a better emulator, wine or vmware?
2007-08-16T07:00:00.000Z	gvsa123		oh really! ooops... my bad... but wine is the one you use if you want to run windows applications
2007-08-16T07:00:00.000Z	gvsa123		ah ok
2007-08-16T07:01:00.000Z	gvsa123		i see... and wine absolutely works?
2007-08-16T07:01:00.000Z	faileas	gvsa123	wine works through linux, dosen't need a copy of windows. it isn't 100% reliable. VMware runs an OS in an OS
2007-08-16T07:01:00.000Z	gvsa123	faileas	got it!
2007-08-18T15:26:00.000Z	faileas	gvsa123	maybe cause debian does
2009-01-04T06:50:00.000Z	faileas	gvsa123	depends on how you set it up
2009-01-04T06:51:00.000Z	gvsa123	faileas	just installed samba, restarted the daemon, right clicked on one of my folders from /home and shared it.
2009-01-04T06:52:00.000Z	gvsa123	faileas	i found it from the ms side but i can't access it... (so safe)
2009-01-04T06:52:00.000Z	faileas	gvsa123	one moment there's a good howto on setting up samba i use
2009-01-04T06:52:00.000Z	gvsa123	faileas	is it this one? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=202605
2009-01-04T06:52:00.000Z	faileas	gvsa123	no http://www.howtoforge.com/ubuntu-gutsy-samba-standalone-server-with-tdbsam-backend
2009-01-04T06:55:00.000Z	gvsa123	faileas	oh that's fine. i've been able to setup using the link i sent, i was just hoping things were much simpler now. last time i had ubuntu was with feisty.
2009-01-04T06:56:00.000Z	faileas	gvsa123	what should interest you is that with the tdbsan backend, you can use your accounts on the box to access samba. ;p
2009-01-04T06:56:00.000Z	gvsa123	faileas	from windows?
2009-01-04T06:57:00.000Z	faileas	gvsa123	yup
2009-01-04T06:57:00.000Z	faileas	gvsa123	i have one file server and a mix of linux and windows boxen- this setup works brilliently
2009-01-04T06:57:00.000Z	gvsa123	faileas	cool eh.. i'd like to keep it simple for now. jsut me and my wife sharing/playing movies from each others' pc...
2009-01-04T07:01:00.000Z	gvsa123	faileas	are you aware of any package from synaptic that simplifies working "mshome"
2009-01-04T07:02:00.000Z	gvsa123	faileas	i'm hoping for something to tell a newbie: "oh just go to synaptic and install this package",.... lol
