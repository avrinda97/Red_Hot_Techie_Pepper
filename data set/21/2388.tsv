2009-11-10T09:13:00.000Z	knoppies	freaky[t]	its called Compiz configuration settings manager in synaptic
2009-11-10T09:14:00.000Z	knoppies	freaky[t]	wait, I meant compizconfig-settings-manager
2009-11-10T09:15:00.000Z	knoppies	freaky[t]	if you looking for icons/borders have a look at gnome-loog.org
