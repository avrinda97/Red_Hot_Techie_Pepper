2008-05-26T10:12:00.000Z	norty		Question: I deleted a folder and its in my trash now, but when I try to empy my trash it says the folder is not empty so it can't be deleted, how can I permanently delete this folder in my trash?
2008-05-26T10:13:00.000Z	Yachaziel	norty	sudo rm <file>
2008-05-26T10:24:00.000Z	norty	Yachaziel	lol that didn't work!
2008-05-26T10:14:00.000Z	norty	Yachaziel	I don't know where the file is.. is there a trash directory somewhere?
2008-05-26T10:14:00.000Z	Yachaziel	norty	Your trash can is in the lower right of your screen.
2008-05-26T10:15:00.000Z	norty	Yachaziel	I know, the folder is in the trash, how do i do sudo rm <folder> if its in the trash, where is it exactly located?
2008-05-26T10:16:00.000Z	Yachaziel	norty	Wouldn't it be easier to restore the file from the trash and then just use that directory? I am not certain what the trash directory is.
2008-05-26T10:17:00.000Z	norty	Yachaziel	how do i restore it?
2008-05-26T10:17:00.000Z	Yachaziel	norty	Drag it from the trash into another folder or onto your desktop.
2008-05-26T10:19:00.000Z	norty	Yachaziel	I tried dragging it from the trash to desktop and it gave me this error: Directory is not empty
2008-05-26T10:19:00.000Z	Yachaziel	norty	How did you get it in there? =O Lol, one moment bud.
2008-05-26T10:20:00.000Z	norty	Yachaziel	lol I don't know, i think i just selected it and hit delete :)
2008-05-26T10:22:00.000Z	Yachaziel	norty	Try this
2008-05-26T10:24:00.000Z	Yachaziel	norty	Gotta love these kinds of files... I know the command to delete it if I can find the directory...
2008-05-26T10:33:00.000Z	Yachaziel	norty	You there?
2008-05-26T10:33:00.000Z	norty	Yachaziel	yea, what's up?
2008-05-26T10:33:00.000Z	Yachaziel	norty	Do this ~/.local/share/Trash (be sure of caps)
2008-05-26T10:34:00.000Z	norty	Yachaziel	cd or rm or what command?
2008-05-26T10:34:00.000Z	Yachaziel	norty	rm -r I think
2008-05-26T10:35:00.000Z	norty	Yachaziel	excellent, that worked, thanks!!
2008-05-26T10:36:00.000Z	Yachaziel	norty	Thank Bazhang too. He was the one who knew the !trash factoid.
