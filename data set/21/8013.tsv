2006-08-17T10:37:00.000Z	billybennett		Does anyone know why I suddently cannot burn any cd / dvd data discs?  I already had both k3b and Gnomebaker.. but neither one works
2006-08-17T10:38:00.000Z	billybennett		Can someone help me fix my cd/dvd drive please? :)
2006-08-17T10:39:00.000Z	ProN00b	billybennett	rebooted already ?
2006-08-17T10:39:00.000Z	ProN00b	billybennett	did any config changes since it doesn't work anymore ?
2006-08-17T10:39:00.000Z	billybennett	ProN00b	yep multiple times... I cannot recall.  The only thing I can think of is installing vmware
2006-08-17T10:40:00.000Z	ProN00b	billybennett	is vmware running ?
2006-08-17T10:40:00.000Z	billybennett	ProN00b	nope havent touched it since
2006-08-17T10:40:00.000Z	ProN00b	billybennett	maybe you should uninstall it, since i think it has background services
2006-08-17T10:41:00.000Z	ProN00b	billybennett	did you try booting from some other os/distro so you can make sure it isn't the fault of your drive ?
2006-08-17T10:41:00.000Z	billybennett	ProN00b	I know the drive is reading correctly but anytime I make a cd/dvd before it even starts I get an input/output error
2006-08-17T10:42:00.000Z	ProN00b	billybennett	wana paste that error ?
2006-08-17T10:42:00.000Z	billybennett	ProN00b	sure.... let me make up a dvd real quick

2006-08-17T10:47:00.000Z	ProN00b	billybennett	"Incorrectly encoded string (3 Floppy (A).lnk) encountered."

2006-08-17T10:48:00.000Z	ProN00b	billybennett	see if you can turn joilet off
2006-08-17T10:48:00.000Z	ProN00b		or rename the file that it mentions
2006-08-17T10:48:00.000Z	billybennett	ProN00b	okay
