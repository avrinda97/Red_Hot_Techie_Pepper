2006-01-27T10:56:00.000Z	shinu		if i put something in the background with '&' and then pull it back with 'fg', is there any way to put it back in the background?..
2006-01-27T10:56:00.000Z	_jason	shinu	ctrl+z
2006-01-27T10:57:00.000Z	shinu	_jason	doesnt that pause the command?
2006-01-27T10:57:00.000Z	_jason	shinu	yeah, then do bg I think
2006-01-27T10:58:00.000Z	shinu	_jason	but when i fg it, i cant type commands.. cause the process 'takes over' the shell
2006-01-27T10:58:00.000Z	_jason	shinu	not fg, bg
2006-01-27T10:58:00.000Z	shinu	_jason	i know.. do you mean i type bg in another shell?
2006-01-27T11:00:00.000Z	_jason	shinu	nope, same shell
2006-01-27T11:00:00.000Z	shinu	_jason	well. when i fg the command i put in background, it doesnt let me type any command in that shell anymore. so i cant type bg.
2006-01-27T11:01:00.000Z	_jason	shinu	ctrl-z then bg
2006-01-27T11:01:00.000Z	shinu	_jason	oh right. thanks :)
2006-01-27T11:02:00.000Z	shinu	_jason	yay :]  cheers
2006-01-27T11:03:00.000Z	_jason	shinu	you can use the 'jobs' command to see what's going on.  And if you start messing with multiple processes you can specify them with %[NUMBER]  which you get from the list.  So you can do 'fg %2' for example
2006-01-27T11:04:00.000Z	shinu	_jason	oh great! none of those command have man pages.. precious info, thanks a lot :)
2006-01-27T11:05:00.000Z	shinu	_jason	mind telling me also what the + and - next to the job numbers mean?..
2006-01-27T11:05:00.000Z	_jason	shinu	yep, you can do kill %2 as well.  You can google 'bash job control'.  I don't know what the + and - are
2006-01-27T11:06:00.000Z	shinu	_jason	oh ok. cheers!
2006-01-27T11:07:00.000Z	_jason	shinu	I think man bash or man builtins probably talks about them
2006-01-27T11:08:00.000Z	shinu	_jason	oh right.. i see
2006-01-27T11:08:00.000Z	shinu	_jason	does indeed.. thanks :)
2006-01-27T11:08:00.000Z	_jason	shinu	yw
