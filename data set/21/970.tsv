2011-03-22T14:02:00.000Z	coz_	critical_max	  just saw your post... have you looked into wmctrl ?
2011-03-22T14:55:00.000Z	critical_max	coz_	just saw your post, checking into wmctrl now
2011-03-22T14:55:00.000Z	coz_	critical_max	cool
2011-03-22T14:55:00.000Z	critical_max	coz_	my ideal solution integrates well with a bash wrapper. my task ultimately involves repackaging and a lot of messy glue
2011-03-22T14:56:00.000Z	coz_	critical_max	 understood... not sure what the best solution would be for this.. wouldnt mind having a nice  very functional automator myself :)
2011-03-22T14:57:00.000Z	critical_max	coz_	sadly, wmctrl doesn't work for wine apps (like most other linux automation tools...)
2011-03-22T14:58:00.000Z	critical_max	coz_	the issue has been tracked down to wine not implementing stuff right for it yet, iirc
2011-03-22T14:58:00.000Z	critical_max	coz_	so i'm going to use my fresh autoit install in wine to do it :)
2011-03-22T14:58:00.000Z	coz_	critical_max	 oh cool
2011-03-22T14:58:00.000Z	critical_max	coz_	yah, autoit is like a cadillac compared to all those other apps anyway *ducks*
2011-03-22T14:59:00.000Z	coz_	critical_max	 I will have to revisit my search and check out this autoit  :)
2011-03-22T15:00:00.000Z	critical_max	coz_	both autohotkey and autoit work pretty well in wine, autohotkey being a fork of autoit. which one you use probably will depend on pre-existing scripts you can reuse written for one or the other. barrier of entry for both is tiny
2011-03-22T15:01:00.000Z	coz_	critical_max	 mm thanks,,, i am checking it out now
2011-03-22T15:01:00.000Z	critical_max	coz_	i'm just not sure how well i can grab environment variables set by my wrapper script..that will be the fun part
2011-03-22T15:01:00.000Z	coz_	critical_max	 good luck on that... would be nice to use something like this to create a compiz ... automated desktop... for a demo
2011-03-22T15:02:00.000Z	critical_max	coz_	if you're trying to impress your boss, i'd go right to Sikuli, it seems to be the new hotness
2011-03-22T15:02:00.000Z	coz_	critical_max	 :)  will check that out as well
2011-03-22T15:43:00.000Z	critical_max	coz_	got AutoIT to read my bash variables :) :)
2011-03-22T16:35:00.000Z	critical_max	coz_	i just succeeded in automating my installer with autoit under wine, and even got it to write out a log of the install path (which is non obvious info via other means)
2011-03-22T16:36:00.000Z	critical_max	coz_	i'd say it works beautifully for gui automation in ubuntu, the clincher for me was its ability to get env vars from bash > wine > autoit
2011-03-22T16:36:00.000Z	critical_max	coz_	now to run it on the 1500 different exe and wait for it to break
