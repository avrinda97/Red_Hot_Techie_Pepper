2004-11-16T14:33:00.000Z	lonetree		does anyone know what to do if you don't get your laptops touchpad recognized automatically? i also tried connecting a ps/2 one but i doesn't get automatically recognized either. i got to remove it and plug it back in...
2004-11-16T14:33:00.000Z	|trey|	lonetree	is it a synaptics touchpad?
2004-11-16T14:33:00.000Z	|trey|	lonetree	apt-cache search touchpad
2004-11-16T15:27:00.000Z	|trey|	lonetree	I told you more then an hour ago "apt-cache search touchpad"... you would have seen tpconfig... touchpad config... try it...
2004-11-16T15:32:00.000Z	|trey|	lonetree	yes, use alien though to create .deb's from the .rpm
2004-11-16T15:32:00.000Z	|trey|	lonetree	installed by default  ;)
2004-11-16T15:32:00.000Z	|trey|	lonetree	to comply with lsb  :)

2004-11-16T15:34:00.000Z	|trey|	lonetree	probably, I'd install it anyways, won't do you any harm...
2004-11-16T15:37:00.000Z	|trey|	lonetree	/etc/init.d/gdm stop
2004-11-16T15:37:00.000Z	|trey|	lonetree	yup
2004-11-16T15:40:00.000Z	|trey|	lonetree	I hate when that happens  :(
2004-11-16T15:41:00.000Z	|trey|	lonetree	dpkg-reconfigure debconf > set to low priority... then dpkg-reconfigure tpconfig, more to config though... then reconfigure debconf back to high...
2004-11-16T15:56:00.000Z	lonetree	|trey|	it don't work...
2004-11-16T15:57:00.000Z	|trey|	lonetree	same with 'locales'
2004-11-16T15:59:00.000Z	|trey|	lonetree	install it  ;)
2004-11-16T16:00:00.000Z	|trey|	lonetree	you installed xfree86-drivers-synaptics?
2004-11-16T16:04:00.000Z	|trey|	lonetree	you can apply patches and recompile your kernel... if you can't follow http://compass.com/synaptics/ though, then I can't be of help  :(
2004-11-16T16:05:00.000Z	|trey|	lonetree	if it seems too complicated etc...
2004-11-16T16:06:00.000Z	|trey|	lonetree	recompiling a kernel isn't really easy enless you know your hardware... but its the only way to get your touchpad working currently... its up to you  :(
2004-11-16T16:07:00.000Z	|trey|	lonetree	module, yes, patch, no
