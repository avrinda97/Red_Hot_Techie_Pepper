2010-05-05T20:32:00.000Z	rafaelsoaresbr		does anyone knows how to discover where grub2 is installed?
2010-05-05T20:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafaelsoaresbr	sudo fdisk -l   the asterisked partition will be the one
2010-05-05T20:34:00.000Z	rafaelsoaresbr	ActionParsnip	Sure? Good to know that it's installed on root partition.
2010-05-05T20:36:00.000Z	rafaelsoaresbr	ActionParsnip	So if I install windows grub is not going to be overwritten.
2010-05-05T20:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafaelsoaresbr	the windows installer will write its bootloader to the drive you install it to, if grub is there now, it will be lost when windows is done and will need to be reinstalled. The settings on the partition will still stand
2010-05-05T20:42:00.000Z	rafaelsoaresbr	ActionParsnip	http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/pVHMeZEY :: I want to install windows to sda1, ubuntu is at sda2. My question is: where is grub installed? If it's in sda2 so great! if it's in MBR it's bad.
2010-05-07T19:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafaelsoaresbr	i'd ask in #fedora
2010-05-07T19:49:00.000Z	rafaelsoaresbr	ActionParsnip	i've already asked #fedora and they say me to remove ubuntu or ask here
2010-05-07T19:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafaelsoaresbr	i'd ask in #vbox too to see if there are known issues with fedora and the vbox version in your ubuntu release
2010-05-07T19:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafaelsoaresbr	still worth MD5 testing
2010-06-06T18:08:00.000Z	rafaelsoaresbr	ActionParsnip	Realy, I didn't know. But in Ubuntu 9.04 it wasn't possible.
2010-06-06T18:06:00.000Z	rafaelsoaresbr	ActionParsnip	AlmostObsolete: Even with less SWAP than RAM I can hibernate.
2010-06-06T18:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafaelsoaresbr	really? how does that work?
2010-06-06T18:11:00.000Z	rafaelsoaresbr	ActionParsnip	And now in 9.10, I have 1526 of RAM and 1010 of SWAP, and it's possible to hibernate
2010-06-07T07:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafaelsoaresbr	both methods have pros and cons
2010-06-07T07:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafaelsoaresbr	partial upgrades arent advised
2010-06-07T07:36:00.000Z	rafaelsoaresbr	ActionParsnip	I can download all packages from local repo but local repo aren't able to be used during upgrading :)
2010-06-07T07:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafaelsoaresbr	i can only advise dude, the docs are there to advise how to upgrade.
2010-06-07T07:41:00.000Z	rafaelsoaresbr	ActionParsnip	techteen: there's a local repo here that can't be used for upgrading, but I think I can download all packges needed by upgrade process (with --download-only option).
2010-06-07T07:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafaelsoaresbr	if it gets you the upgrade then do it is all i can say
2010-09-22T23:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rafaelsoaresbr	do you have a buddy with a broadband link who can pull you down the install cd?
