2010-11-13T21:29:00.000Z	Theta		is there anything I can do using 8.04's CD?
2010-11-13T21:29:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Theta	cd-rw?
2010-11-13T21:29:00.000Z	Theta		or is there anything in general I can try to do to get X working?
2010-11-13T21:29:00.000Z	Theta	aeon-ltd	what do you mean?
2010-11-13T21:29:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Theta	is it burnt to a cd-rw?
2010-11-13T21:30:00.000Z	Theta		yes
2010-11-13T21:30:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Theta	then get 10.04, or a specialist iso like backtrack
2010-11-13T21:30:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Theta	or customise with reconstructor or remastersys
2010-11-13T21:32:00.000Z	Theta	aeon-ltd	so, 8.04 cd is of no good for fixing a 10.04 installation?
2010-11-13T21:32:00.000Z	Theta		forget about the cd then, what can I mess up with to try and get the display to work?
2010-11-13T21:32:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Theta	not really, the only thing thats useful would be terminal tools like dd, and gparted. everything else is outdated and buggy relative to 10.04
2010-11-13T21:33:00.000Z	Theta	aeon-ltd	I'm on 10.04's shell.
2010-11-13T21:33:00.000Z	Theta	aeon-ltd	so, is there anything I can do from there?
2010-11-13T21:33:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Theta	has X ever worked on this system?
2010-11-13T21:34:00.000Z	Theta		no
2010-11-13T21:34:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Theta	what video card?
2010-11-13T21:34:00.000Z	Theta		Silicon Integrated Systmes [SiS] 771/671 PCIE VGA Display Adapter
2010-11-13T21:34:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Theta	drivers didn't work?
2010-11-13T21:35:00.000Z	Theta		don't have them.
2010-11-13T21:35:00.000Z	Theta		maybe I can download them from another pc. if I did, how can I install them?
2010-11-13T21:37:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Theta	you could try this but it i wouldn't expect much http://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-install-sis-771671-mirage-3-video-drivers-in-ubuntu-10-04-lucid.html
