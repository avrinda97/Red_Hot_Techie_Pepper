2006-10-13T12:36:00.000Z	Arafangion	PerhamX	What kind of modem?
2006-10-13T12:37:00.000Z	Arafangion	PerhamX	Which laptop?
2006-10-13T12:41:00.000Z	Arafangion	PerhamX	Again, which laptop do you have?
2006-10-13T12:50:00.000Z	Arafangion	PerhamX	Incorrect.
2006-10-13T12:50:00.000Z	Arafangion	PerhamX	Windows is merely more *familiar*
2006-10-13T13:03:00.000Z	Arafangion	PerhamX	Depends on your country.
2006-10-13T13:03:00.000Z	Arafangion	PerhamX	Here, I am quite sure it's illegal, (Australia), but everybody does it.
2006-10-13T13:03:00.000Z	Arafangion	PerhamX	Specifically, it's called "
2006-10-13T13:03:00.000Z	Arafangion	PerhamX	"Format Shifting".
2006-10-13T13:04:00.000Z	Arafangion	PerhamX	Recently there's been a bill raised, but I'm not sure if it's been accepted, that allows "Format Shifting", which would mean that people can purchase a CD, rip it to cassette for personal use, and then play it on their cassette player in their own damn CAR!
2006-10-13T13:04:00.000Z	Arafangion	PerhamX	STOP!
