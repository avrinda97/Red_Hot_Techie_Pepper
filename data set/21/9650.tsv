2005-09-06T16:54:00.000Z	osfameron	cafuego	that's the bunny!
2005-09-13T15:54:00.000Z	cafuego	osfameron	it was probably time to log out anyway.
2005-09-13T15:55:00.000Z	osfameron	cafuego	unfortunately not... late morning here :-)
2005-09-13T16:00:00.000Z	cafuego	osfameron	has is happened more than once?
2005-09-13T16:01:00.000Z	cafuego	osfameron	*any* chance you may have accidentally clicked 'Log out' ?
2005-09-13T16:02:00.000Z	osfameron	cafuego	I would normally say no, as I'm not that fat fingered
2005-09-13T16:03:00.000Z	cafuego	osfameron	Well, if it happens again i'd worry.. if not, clack it up to cosmic radiation or something ;-)
2005-11-08T14:28:00.000Z	cafuego	osfameron	More likely nobody knows the answer.
2005-11-08T14:29:00.000Z	osfameron	cafuego	that's ok then :-)  I'll update wiki ad factlets if I find an answer...
2005-11-08T14:29:00.000Z	cafuego	osfameron	That's what it's for ;-)
2006-10-24T13:25:00.000Z	cafuego	osfameron	Depends on what happens in terms of the kernel randomly killing apps to free memory (coz thats what it'll do)
2006-10-24T13:26:00.000Z	osfameron	cafuego	well, when Inkscape and Sodipodi were having trouble, the kernel quite happily killed those
2006-10-24T13:26:00.000Z	osfameron	cafuego	whereas with Opera and Firefox it just chugs away alarmingly
2006-10-24T13:26:00.000Z	cafuego	osfameron	Well, you can give it some swap and see if it makes a difference.
2006-10-24T13:27:00.000Z	cafuego	osfameron	just swap to a file, not  apartition.
2006-10-24T13:28:00.000Z	osfameron	cafuego	that's what the instructions in https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq suggest
2006-10-24T13:29:00.000Z	cafuego	osfameron	beer
2006-10-24T13:29:00.000Z	osfameron	cafuego	mmmmm, beer
2006-10-24T13:30:00.000Z	cafuego	osfameron	In terms of reasons why you forgot to add swap: too much beer ;-)
2006-10-24T13:31:00.000Z	osfameron	cafuego	mmmm, bee... oh, yes, I got that :-)  I think it was probably me just clicking on "yeah, whatever" through the installation process actually :-)
