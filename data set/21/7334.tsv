2006-10-20T15:39:00.000Z	gansinho	BubbaTheLoveSpon	sorry I do not speak english as a native language, what's a bummer?
2006-10-20T15:39:00.000Z	BubbaTheLoveSpon	gansinho	it is an american slang term for something that makes you feel bad emotionally
2006-10-20T15:40:00.000Z	gansinho	BubbaTheLoveSpon	yes its a bummer...
2006-10-20T15:40:00.000Z	gansinho	BubbaTheLoveSpon	is there any oher way to update?
2006-10-20T15:40:00.000Z	BubbaTheLoveSpon	gansinho	you can use apt-get
2006-10-20T15:41:00.000Z	gansinho	BubbaTheLoveSpon	I'll lose my /home this way?
2006-10-20T15:41:00.000Z	BubbaTheLoveSpon	gansinho	no, apt is a tool , that gui thing is just a frontend for apt I think
2006-10-20T15:42:00.000Z	gansinho	BubbaTheLoveSpon	the only way to lose info is from a fresh install right?
2006-10-20T15:43:00.000Z	BubbaTheLoveSpon	gansinho	god no, theres loads of ways to lose your data, but updating your system with apt shouldnt be one of them - heres the problem though - if you run into that issue with the GUI tool theres a decent chance youll run into it with apt
2006-10-20T15:43:00.000Z	gansinho	BubbaTheLoveSpon	i'll try now
2006-10-20T15:53:00.000Z	gansinho	BubbaTheLoveSpon	thanks anyway
2006-10-20T15:53:00.000Z	BubbaTheLoveSpon	gansinho	why not just use apt-get?
