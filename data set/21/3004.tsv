2011-02-01T03:51:00.000Z	VCoolio	_joey	as a launcher: right click panel, add to panel, custom app launcher and you'll know what to enter
2011-02-01T03:50:00.000Z	VCoolio	_joey	right click 'Applications', edit menu, add entry with right command and icon of your choice
2011-02-01T03:54:00.000Z	_joey	VCoolio	thanks but when I start the application i get a message it can't find application's directory
2011-02-01T03:55:00.000Z	VCoolio	_joey	what command did you enter in the box? and what command is that? Try it in a terminal first
2011-02-01T03:56:00.000Z	_joey	VCoolio	stata-se it's a commercial application for linux which installed in $HOME/stata
2011-02-01T03:57:00.000Z	VCoolio	_joey	you used the full path, like /home/joey/stata/stata-se ?
2011-02-01T03:59:00.000Z	VCoolio	_joey	what with "cd /home/joey/stata && stata-se" ? is the executable itself not found or does it complain about other stuffnog found?
2011-02-01T04:00:00.000Z	_joey	VCoolio	yes
2011-02-01T04:01:00.000Z	VCoolio	_joey	I don't know; if the shell works, write a little script and execute that in the launcher, like #!/bin/bash and 2nd line /home/joey/stata/stata-se
2011-02-01T04:04:00.000Z	_joey	VCoolio	nope
2011-02-01T04:04:00.000Z	_joey	VCoolio	cannot find Stata directory
2011-02-01T04:06:00.000Z	VCoolio	_joey	then I don't know, does it work if you click it in the file manager? Then create a symlink to it on your desktop and drag that onto the panel, maybe works. Else I give up
2011-02-01T04:07:00.000Z	_joey	VCoolio	it's just fscked up, that's all
2011-02-01T04:08:00.000Z	_joey	VCoolio	may be I will all /home/joey/stata to $PATH ?
2011-02-01T04:10:00.000Z	VCoolio	_joey	that will only help to execute stata-se directly without path, but give it a shot; you know how to do that?
2011-02-01T04:10:00.000Z	_joey	VCoolio	what else can I try?
2011-02-01T04:12:00.000Z	VCoolio	_joey	yes, that's why I suggested cd blah && execute, to set current directory first; but add it to $PATH, won't hurt
2011-02-01T04:14:00.000Z	_joey	VCoolio	where did you suggest that?
2011-02-01T04:15:00.000Z	VCoolio	_joey	23:59 CET
2011-02-01T04:16:00.000Z	VCoolio	_joey	put it on ubuntuforums in general help and go to bed before you get frustrated, try again tomorrow
2011-02-01T04:18:00.000Z	_joey	VCoolio	I can understand why people are complaining about Desktop usability. Something as simple as running application from the panel and there are so many problems
