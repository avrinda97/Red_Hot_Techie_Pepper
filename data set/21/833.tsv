2011-05-30T04:46:00.000Z	KM0201	RevSpecies116	i'm not frustrated... i just can't believe he not only is talking irrelevant, he's suggesting somethign he's already said he's having an issue w/ (booting from a USB)... so now.. he wants him to use wubi, on a hard drive that has about 2gigs of space, or he wants him to use a USB, on a machine eh can't figure out how to boot a USB on...
2011-05-30T04:52:00.000Z	KM0201	RevSpecies116	xubuntu and lubuntu, still require (more or less) the same amount of space as Ubuntu (maybe a tad less)..
2011-05-30T04:53:00.000Z	KM0201	RevSpecies116	lubuntu is probably the smallest of the 4... but.. it's still pretty close.. we're talking only a couple 100mb i'd bet.
2011-05-31T05:27:00.000Z	KM0201	RevSpecies116	i thought 11.10 was also gonna have gnome 3 available?
2011-05-31T05:31:00.000Z	KM0201	RevSpecies116	technically, thats what they are.... thats what i agree w/ you.
2011-05-31T08:19:00.000Z	KM0201	RevSpecies116	really?  how?
2011-05-31T08:23:00.000Z	KM0201	RevSpecies116	well, that vlc tool shows some very strange behavior for me... i'll keep using record my desktop
2011-05-31T08:24:00.000Z	RevSpecies116	KM0201	I have similar problems, but then again this laptop is not made to do intensive stuff ;)
2011-05-31T08:24:00.000Z	KM0201	RevSpecies116	neither is mine.. :)... but recordmydesktop works well.
2011-05-31T08:26:00.000Z	KM0201	RevSpecies116	i don't see why it couldn't, it records in ogv format, then you could upload it anywhere you want i'd imagine
2011-05-31T09:11:00.000Z	RevSpecies116	KM0201	I'm proud of you showing a COMPLETE Ubuntu newbie a way of running bin files without anyway of using update manager to get updates for it ;)
2011-05-31T09:12:00.000Z	KM0201	RevSpecies116	you'd be amazed at the patience i have... dealing w/ crazies all day keeps me sane outside of work
2011-05-31T09:14:00.000Z	KM0201	RevSpecies116	the version in the ubuntu repos, sucks... i never bothered to see if adobe had a repo fo rit.
2011-05-31T09:52:00.000Z	KM0201	RevSpecies116	boy that would be a disaster i bet
2011-05-31T09:58:00.000Z	KM0201	RevSpecies116	i actually started w/ fedora 3 or 4.. used fedora till 5, then tried ubuntu 6.06.. and used ubuntu till 9.10, then debian for a while, and now i'm back to using ubuntu.
2011-06-05T05:29:00.000Z	KM0201	RevSpecies116	sata shouldn't...
2011-06-05T05:31:00.000Z	KM0201	RevSpecies116	have you tried to force unmount it?
