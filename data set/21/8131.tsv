2006-06-03T05:46:00.000Z	Dextorion		anyone figured out a neat webbased game for me yet? :p

2006-06-03T05:52:00.000Z	Dextorion	RandolphCarter	wow, how long have you been playing that thingey?
2006-06-03T05:53:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	Dextorion	I used to play it at work a lot, we were administrating Solaris systems, so it kinda looked like I was working
2006-06-03T05:53:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	Dextorion	not so much anymore though :(
2006-06-03T05:53:00.000Z	Dextorion	RandolphCarter	hehehe. .    awww.. alrihgty
2006-06-03T05:53:00.000Z	Dextorion	RandolphCarter	must be some damn devoted people that made that one huh. Seams pretty damn big.
2006-06-03T05:54:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	Dextorion	yeah, it's Iron Realms, try googling for 'em - they have quite a few MUDs/MUSHs running
2006-06-03T05:54:00.000Z	Dextorion	RandolphCarter	:D alrighty. I'll do that
2006-06-03T05:55:00.000Z	Dextorion	RandolphCarter	hey, when ever you get a job like that again. Tell me, and i'll send you my assembly laborations, so you can write them for me. ok? 8-)
2006-06-03T05:56:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	Dextorion	:P
2006-06-03T05:58:00.000Z	Dextorion	RandolphCarter	Its damn hard to do programming in assembly when i find java and c++ so much more fun.
2006-06-03T05:59:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	Dextorion	agreed :/ just be thankful it's only Uni assignments I guess
2006-06-03T05:59:00.000Z	Dextorion	RandolphCarter	true
2006-06-03T06:00:00.000Z	Dextorion	RandolphCarter	Some special client i should look into with that achaea?
2006-06-03T06:01:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	Dextorion	gnome-mud's pretty good for Ubuntu, some command line ones like tintin++ are good too
2006-06-03T06:02:00.000Z	Dextorion	RandolphCarter	merci.  think i did an apt-get on that tintin thingey.  dont know how it works though. couldnt find any binary for it
2006-06-03T06:02:00.000Z	Dextorion	RandolphCarter	gnome-mud worked just fine. thanks
2006-06-03T06:03:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	Dextorion	:)
