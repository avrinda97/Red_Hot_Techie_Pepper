2009-05-09T00:42:00.000Z	Kevin`	noob	if you have linux installed already on something, just stick the drive into that
2009-05-09T00:43:00.000Z	noob	Kevin`	the notebook only has usb port, but the usb port doesnt allow booting, so i removed the hard drive and connected it to my UBUNTU laptop and installed it from live cd..
