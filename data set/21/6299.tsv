2007-06-17T09:52:00.000Z	Trixsey		How do I get Eclipse for instance, without the RECOMMENDED packages? (gcj in this case)?
2007-06-17T09:52:00.000Z	Trixsey		apt-get install eclipse --someparam?
2007-06-17T09:53:00.000Z	sn0	Trixsey	apt-get install will not install recommended packages by default, aptitude install will however
2007-06-17T09:53:00.000Z	Trixsey	sn0	but it does :(
2007-06-17T09:54:00.000Z	sn0	Trixsey	see http://packages.ubuntu.com/feisty/devel/eclipse
2007-06-17T09:55:00.000Z	Trixsey	sn0	then why does it include GCJ when I type "sudo apt-get install eclipse"?
2007-06-17T09:56:00.000Z	sn0	Trixsey	im not sure, have you tried in synaptic? and check that gcj is not enabled/ticket
2007-06-17T09:56:00.000Z	Trixsey	sn0	yes.. it wants gcj then as well
2007-06-17T09:56:00.000Z	Trixsey	sn0	although it specifically says on that site, that it is a recommended package
2007-06-17T09:57:00.000Z	Trixsey	sn0	is there no --ignore-recommends or something?
2007-06-17T09:57:00.000Z	sn0	Trixsey	indeed, that is strange - hopefully someone more enlightened is awake :)
2007-06-17T09:58:00.000Z	Trixsey	sn0	I've had this problem before too.. but I gave up at some point.. have been trying for 4-5 hours to get it working without gcj lol
2007-06-17T10:05:00.000Z	sn0	Trixsey	can i ask whyy you dont want gcj?
2007-06-17T10:06:00.000Z	Trixsey	sn0	Azureus isn't fully compatible with GCJ, which is why it crashes for so many people (including me)
2007-06-17T10:06:00.000Z	Trixsey	sn0	I've also experienced various compatibility issues, as GCJ is not 100% compatible with Java...
2007-06-17T10:06:00.000Z	Trixsey	sn0	aside from Azureus that is
2007-06-17T10:07:00.000Z	sn0	Trixsey	do you have java-gcj-compat installed ?
2007-06-17T10:08:00.000Z	Trixsey	sn0	I had when I had the compatibility issues yes.. now I removed GCJ for good
2007-06-17T10:08:00.000Z	Trixsey	sn0	and yes, I had that specific package too
2007-06-17T10:17:00.000Z	sn0	Trixsey	sorry bloddy fones ;)
2007-06-17T10:18:00.000Z	Trixsey	sn0	yeah but I'm one of those annoying people that don't buy a new car when it's not working.. but try to fix it.. (I know it's not a fully comparable scenario, but you get the point)
