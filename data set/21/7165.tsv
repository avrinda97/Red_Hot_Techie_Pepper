2008-09-13T02:36:00.000Z	airtonix		i remember stumbling across a webpage that described a command that allows you to limit a programms cpu usage to just one cpu core rather than spreading it across both cores, anyone know which command this is?
2008-09-13T02:37:00.000Z	Slart	airtonix	cpulimit?
2008-09-13T02:46:00.000Z	airtonix	Slart	mmm some reason i remember the prog name had task in it
2008-09-13T02:46:00.000Z	Slart	airtonix	ok.. hang on
2008-09-13T02:46:00.000Z	airtonix	Slart	i also remember this prog being part of a solution for playing wow under wine...
2008-09-13T02:51:00.000Z	airtonix	Slart	ah i found it, on the virtualbox wiki page at help.ubuntu : the prog i wanted is taskset
2008-09-13T02:51:00.000Z	airtonix	Slart	taskset -c 1 virtualbox
2009-12-15T21:25:00.000Z	airtonix	Slart	is this correct? the purpose for which you are using ultrasurf is anominty ?>
2009-12-15T21:25:00.000Z	Slart	airtonix	I'm not the one using ultrasurf.. I was just answering pcgenius question
2009-12-27T19:59:00.000Z	airtonix	Slart	apart from the fragmentation of having a swap file ?
2009-12-27T20:00:00.000Z	Slart	airtonix	fragementation? it's a fixed file.. why would it become fragmented?
2009-12-27T20:00:00.000Z	airtonix	Slart	becuase its a file subject to the same conditions as any other file ...
2009-12-27T20:01:00.000Z	Slart	airtonix	and a normal file will get fragmented over time?
2009-12-27T20:01:00.000Z	airtonix	Slart	depends on which blocks it gets assigned to and if you specify that the swap file is one that auto-grows
2009-12-27T20:02:00.000Z	Slart	airtonix	oh.. autogrowing swap file? no.. I was thinking of just creating a big static file
2009-12-27T20:02:00.000Z	airtonix	Slart	i assume you understand how a contigious set of data blocks gets put down on a disk when there is not one large set of contigious set of blank blocks for it to go in ?
2009-12-27T20:03:00.000Z	Slart	airtonix	ah.. but I have a disk with 90% free space I was thinking of using
2009-12-27T20:03:00.000Z	airtonix	Slart	i don't think there is any difference in performance then
2009-12-27T20:04:00.000Z	Slart	airtonix	and a couple if file fragments isn't really a problem... as long as it isn't hundreds of fragments I'm happy =)
2009-12-27T20:04:00.000Z	airtonix	Slart	actually those concerns of mine aren't a problem (if they are your disk is possibly 99% full)
2010-04-14T17:53:00.000Z	Slart	airtonix	I don't think the system monitor includes cache when it reports memory usage
