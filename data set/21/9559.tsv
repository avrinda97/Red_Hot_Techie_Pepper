2005-08-31T13:18:00.000Z	zbox		Hi folks. I have a question. Is it may imagination or is Hoary not as stable as Warty?
2005-08-31T13:18:00.000Z	zbox		LOL
2005-08-31T13:19:00.000Z	zbox		i loved warty. it was a rock. but yah i do have issues wit hoary. nautilus crashes for no reason sometimes. and i'm still having issues with firefox even after doing the fix for it
2005-08-31T13:21:00.000Z	zbox		and naturally i have had no problems with gnome terminal LOL
2005-08-31T13:22:00.000Z	zbox		what ya got for sale bz0b?
2005-08-31T13:22:00.000Z	bz0b	zbox	not much, just an amd 64 3200+, 1gb ram, 200gb hd, 128mb nvidia video card
2005-08-31T13:23:00.000Z	bz0b	zbox	i dont think that's too much
2005-08-31T13:24:00.000Z	bz0b	zbox	hehe
2005-08-31T13:25:00.000Z	bz0b	zbox	my father just sold our house for 1.5 mil, that we paid 330,000 6 years ago
2005-08-31T13:29:00.000Z	zbox	bz0b	i'm a noob  and have no idea what that means LOL
2005-08-31T13:30:00.000Z	bz0b	zbox	means that I can have root access to your computer, with access to one of your users
2005-08-31T13:32:00.000Z	bz0b	zbox	actually, with ssh access to any user you create on a warty box, i can crack root, no joke
2005-08-31T13:34:00.000Z	bz0b	zbox	you don't believe me? in a screen on the warty server i just installed, I can prove it to you
2005-08-31T13:35:00.000Z	zbox	bz0b	i hate to tell you this but frankly i don't care LOL
2005-08-31T13:36:00.000Z	zbox	bz0b	are you like that german guy that was in that thing that was going around who insisted he was going to "wipe your hard drive any second now"?
2005-08-31T13:37:00.000Z	bz0b	zbox	no, I am just proving the point on what you said, how warty was not as safe as hoary
2005-08-31T13:37:00.000Z	zbox	bz0b	i never said anythig about saftey between warty and hoary. i said stability.
2005-08-31T13:38:00.000Z	bz0b	zbox	ok i digressed. sorry. so is the consensus that hoary is just as stable as warty is?
2005-08-31T13:40:00.000Z	bz0b	zbox	in my opinion, security is part of stability
2005-08-31T13:46:00.000Z	bz0b	zbox	i guess i will keep my opions to my self from now on
2005-08-31T13:46:00.000Z	zbox	bz0b	opinions are fine.
