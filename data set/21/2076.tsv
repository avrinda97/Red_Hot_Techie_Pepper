2010-01-26T12:20:00.000Z	Tartaros	sommmiing	have you tried first killall nm-applet and then nm-applet again?
2010-01-26T12:22:00.000Z	sommmiing	Tartaros	where do i find the icon for network manager
2010-01-26T12:23:00.000Z	Tartaros	sommmiing	it should be in the notification applet
2010-01-26T12:23:00.000Z	sommmiing	Tartaros	still cant see it
2010-01-26T12:24:00.000Z	Tartaros	sommmiing	well do you have the notification applet on your panel? it should show all kind of icons, like one for sound volume, one for pidgin/empathy, one for display settings etc.
2010-01-26T12:25:00.000Z	Tartaros	sommmiing	try to go thru the applets that it shows you for adding on the panels...
2010-01-26T12:25:00.000Z	sommmiing	Tartaros	oh ok, it doesnt show there.
2010-01-26T12:26:00.000Z	Tartaros	sommmiing	well then try "killall nm-applet", then "sudo service NetworkManager --full-restart" and then "nm-applet&disown"
2010-01-26T12:27:00.000Z	sommmiing	Tartaros	networkmanager: unrecognized service
2010-01-26T12:27:00.000Z	Tartaros	sommmiing	oh sorry it's "network-manager"
2010-01-26T12:29:00.000Z	sommmiing	Tartaros	the script your attemping to invoke hav been converted to an upstart job but ---fullrestart is not supported
2010-01-26T12:30:00.000Z	Tartaros	sommmiing	its --full-restart
2010-01-26T12:30:00.000Z	Tartaros	sommmiing	and ignore the "been converted to upstart" part
2010-01-26T12:34:00.000Z	sommmiing	Tartaros	after all the commands what should happend?
2010-01-26T12:39:00.000Z	sommmiing	Tartaros	any other ideas?
2010-01-26T12:39:00.000Z	Tartaros	sommmiing	does it say something after you start the nm-applet?
2010-01-26T12:40:00.000Z	sommmiing	Tartaros	yes that i might need to add a start command or soming
2010-01-26T12:42:00.000Z	Tartaros	sommmiing	dunno about that. Are you sure you have the notification applet displayed?
2010-01-26T12:43:00.000Z	sommmiing	Tartaros	in the top right hand corener i have an envelope icop and thte bluetooth and volume icons but not network manager con
2010-01-26T12:44:00.000Z	Tartaros	sommmiing	well the envelope should be a separate applet
