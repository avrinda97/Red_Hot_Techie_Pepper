2009-12-02T06:55:00.000Z	BraveSaintStuart		so is there any other way to install Adobe Flashplayer so that it might work?
2009-12-02T06:57:00.000Z	BraveSaintStuart		Adobe Flashplayer problems, anyone?
2009-12-02T06:57:00.000Z	BraveSaintStuart		no one?
2009-12-02T06:58:00.000Z	trism	BraveSaintStuart	sudo apt-get install flashplugin-installer is all you need
2009-12-02T06:58:00.000Z	BraveSaintStuart	trism	I don't know even know what that means
2009-12-02T07:02:00.000Z	BraveSaintStuart	trism	?
2009-12-02T07:03:00.000Z	trism	BraveSaintStuart	it should say things such as downloading flashplugin-installer, unpacking, installing, etc...then you should be good to go
2009-12-02T07:03:00.000Z	BraveSaintStuart	trism	 oh... actually more interesting, and possibly frustrating
2009-12-02T07:04:00.000Z	trism	BraveSaintStuart	what did it say after you typed the command?
2009-12-02T07:04:00.000Z	BraveSaintStuart	trism	it just says "flashplugin-installer is already the newest version"
2009-12-02T07:04:00.000Z	BraveSaintStuart	trism	this is definitely frustrating because I've already restarted Firefox and Ubuntu
2009-12-02T07:04:00.000Z	trism	BraveSaintStuart	so no flash apps work?
2009-12-02T07:04:00.000Z	BraveSaintStuart	trism	nothing so far
2009-12-02T07:05:00.000Z	BraveSaintStuart	trism	 I suppose I should try something like on YouTube or something, but espn.com doesn't seem to want to show me anything
2009-12-02T07:06:00.000Z	trism	BraveSaintStuart	not all flash apps will work in the linux version unfortunately
2009-12-02T07:06:00.000Z	trism	BraveSaintStuart	try youtube though, because that definitely works
2009-12-02T07:06:00.000Z	BraveSaintStuart	trism	correct... it does... that's a little disappointing though
2009-12-02T07:07:00.000Z	trism	BraveSaintStuart	yes it is
2009-12-02T07:07:00.000Z	BraveSaintStuart	trism	perhaps I'll still be able to watch some goodness on hulu or something, and I'll have to use GASP Windows for ESPN.  Poo
2009-12-02T07:08:00.000Z	trism	BraveSaintStuart	yeah hulu works fine too
2009-12-02T07:08:00.000Z	BraveSaintStuart	trism	 Well good deal... thanks for the help... I'm sure the intelligent minds behind ubuntu will get keep making this thing better
