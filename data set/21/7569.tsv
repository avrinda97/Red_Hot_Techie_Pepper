2006-11-10T06:41:00.000Z	mumrah	sethk	ok thanks
2006-11-10T06:36:00.000Z	sethk	mumrah	when you are troubleshooting, it's a very bad idea to say "my fstab is fine."  Perhaps it is, but you have a problem, and you don't know what is causing it, and eliminating fstab isn't a good place to start.
2006-11-10T06:37:00.000Z	mumrah	sethk	fair enough. where should i move from here
2006-11-10T06:39:00.000Z	mumrah	sethk	lol, no offense taken. how do i run something as strace?
2006-11-10T06:40:00.000Z	sethk	mumrah	suppose you are running the command    mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom    to run under strace, you do:   strace -o strace.mount -ff mount -t iso9660 ...

2006-11-10T06:44:00.000Z	sethk	mumrah	ok
2006-11-10T06:56:00.000Z	mumrah	sethk	was that mine? http://enja.org/david/strace_mount.txt ?
2006-11-10T06:56:00.000Z	sethk	mumrah	yes
2006-11-10T06:57:00.000Z	sethk	mumrah	it is saying there is no cd in /dev/cdrom0
2006-11-10T06:57:00.000Z	sethk	mumrah	that either means that /dev/cdrom0 isn't pointing at your drive.  Or it could mean the drive is not configured correctly.  Or it could be that you forgot to put the cd in.  :)
2006-11-10T06:58:00.000Z	sethk	mumrah	your cd drive is IDE secondary master?
2006-11-10T06:58:00.000Z	mumrah	sethk	methinks so
2006-11-10T06:58:00.000Z	mumrah	sethk	lemme check
2006-11-10T06:59:00.000Z	mumrah	sethk	affirmative, secondary master
2006-11-10T06:59:00.000Z	sethk	mumrah	ok.  can you boot and run the live cd?
2006-11-10T07:00:00.000Z	mumrah	sethk	not sure
2006-11-10T07:01:00.000Z	mumrah	sethk	i upgraded with the update manager
2006-11-10T07:03:00.000Z	mumrah	sethk	i'm gonna try the live cd, thanks for the help if you're gone when i return
2006-11-10T07:13:00.000Z	mumrah	sethk	i cant seem to boot to the live cd
2006-11-10T07:14:00.000Z	sethk	mumrah	really sounds like a hardware issue with this cd drive.  you might try disabling DMA in the BIOS setup.  (most, but not all, BIOS setups let you do that)
