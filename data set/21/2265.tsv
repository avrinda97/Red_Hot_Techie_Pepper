2009-11-23T09:31:00.000Z	flexible		hey, is there any reason that my router settings page should take a few seconds to load?
2009-11-23T09:31:00.000Z	keppi	flexible	 slow router?
2009-11-23T09:32:00.000Z	flexible	keppi	it is a reasonably new one... wireless n...
2009-11-23T09:32:00.000Z	flexible	keppi	of course it is possible, but it seems unlikely.... could it be DNS issues?
2009-11-23T09:32:00.000Z	keppi	flexible	 what brand?  Routers have built in web servers and if it's a slow processer then it could serve pages slowly
2009-11-23T09:33:00.000Z	flexible	keppi	netgear, model is wnr2000
2009-11-23T09:33:00.000Z	keppi	flexible	 DNS only affects things going through the router.  If you're acessing the router, you should be accessing it directly
2009-11-23T09:34:00.000Z	flexible	keppi	anything i can do to speed it up, or rather is there any reason it would be slow that i can fix?
2009-11-23T09:35:00.000Z	keppi	flexible	 is it all pages or maybe just the status page?
2009-11-23T09:38:00.000Z	flexible	keppi	all pages on the router web service load slowly.... takes about three seconds at least to load every page
2009-11-23T09:40:00.000Z	keppi	flexible	 try hard reseting your router?
2009-11-23T09:43:00.000Z	flexible	keppi	i might try that during the week actually, can't hurt.
2009-11-23T09:44:00.000Z	keppi	flexible	 are you able to access internet pages quickly?
2009-11-23T09:45:00.000Z	flexible	keppi	not as fast as i should be able to
2009-11-23T09:46:00.000Z	keppi	flexible	 you could run speedtest.net to see if your internet connection is up to par
2009-11-23T09:46:00.000Z	flexible	keppi	my router says around 13500 kbps downstream
2009-11-23T09:47:00.000Z	keppi	flexible	 what is your ping time?
2009-11-23T09:48:00.000Z	keppi	flexible	 on the speed test
2009-11-23T09:49:00.000Z	keppi	flexible	 ping should be in "ms"
2009-11-23T09:53:00.000Z	keppi	flexible	 that sounds fine
2009-11-23T09:54:00.000Z	keppi	flexible	 sure it's not the other way around?
