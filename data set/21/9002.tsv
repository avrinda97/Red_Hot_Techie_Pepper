2005-11-28T17:40:00.000Z	Black_Hat		ive got a question
2005-11-28T17:41:00.000Z	Black_Hat		can i use debian repositories safely in ubuntu?
2005-11-28T17:41:00.000Z	intelikey	Black_Hat	no
2005-11-28T17:41:00.000Z	Black_Hat		does ubuntu have unstable source trees?
2005-11-28T17:41:00.000Z	intelikey	Black_Hat	dapper
2005-11-28T17:41:00.000Z	Black_Hat		dapper?
2005-11-28T17:42:00.000Z	intelikey	Black_Hat	what would you want newer than the stable repos ?
2005-11-28T17:42:00.000Z	Black_Hat		but i cant use unstable sources with breezy or whatever the latest stable release is? or i can again with a level of risk?
2005-11-28T17:43:00.000Z	intelikey	Black_Hat	breezy just released a month ago....
2005-11-28T17:44:00.000Z	Black_Hat	intelikey	but its ubuntus most recent stable release
2005-11-28T17:44:00.000Z	intelikey		yeah and the dapper is on month newer....
2005-11-28T17:44:00.000Z	Black_Hat		i want to use unstable source lists
2005-11-28T17:44:00.000Z	Black_Hat		basically
2005-11-28T17:44:00.000Z	Black_Hat		if that makes sense
2005-11-28T17:44:00.000Z	intelikey		then run dapper
2005-11-28T17:45:00.000Z	Black_Hat	intelikey	and if i choose to run breezy? am i again operating with a certain level of risk?
2005-11-28T17:45:00.000Z	intelikey		well breezy is supposed to be stable.... but there are a few bugs...
2005-11-28T17:46:00.000Z	Black_Hat	intelikey	so i can run unstable on breezy if i wanted?
2005-11-28T17:47:00.000Z	intelikey	Black_Hat	with less trubble than using deb debs  yes.
2005-11-28T17:48:00.000Z	intelikey		!spam
2005-11-28T17:49:00.000Z	Black_Hat	intelikey	so is there an ubuntu unstable source tree?
