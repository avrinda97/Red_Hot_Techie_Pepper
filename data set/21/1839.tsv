2010-05-08T17:50:00.000Z	awesome_guest		yo I'm trying to install vncserver
2010-05-08T17:51:00.000Z	awesome_guest		I don't think my synaptic setup includes the multiverse
2010-05-08T17:51:00.000Z	awesome_guest		could someone give me a commandline solution for fixing that?
2010-05-08T17:52:00.000Z	jrib	awesome_guest	pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list
2010-05-08T17:55:00.000Z	awesome_guest	jrib	do I have to reboot after updating sources.list?
2010-05-08T17:55:00.000Z	jrib	awesome_guest	no, run "sudo apt-get update", did you pastebin them?
2010-05-08T17:55:00.000Z	awesome_guest	jrib	http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/0NqSj5Ts
2010-05-08T17:56:00.000Z	jrib	awesome_guest	what's the obvious thing?  There were two things you had to do to the file
2010-05-08T17:56:00.000Z	jrib	awesome_guest	note that doesn't give you multiverse, just universe
2010-05-08T17:57:00.000Z	jrib	awesome_guest	ok
2010-05-08T17:59:00.000Z	awesome_guest	jrib	so my understanding is, one can just edit sources.list once the correct repository is identified
2010-05-08T17:59:00.000Z	jrib	awesome_guest	yes
2010-05-08T17:59:00.000Z	jrib	awesome_guest	make sure you only use repositories intended for your ubuntu version however, ideally only the official ones
2010-05-08T18:00:00.000Z	awesome_guest	jrib	why's that?
2010-05-08T18:00:00.000Z	awesome_guest	jrib	nvm "intended for your ubuntu version"
2010-05-08T18:01:00.000Z	awesome_guest	jrib	do you know how synaptic deals with name conflicts between introduced packages?
2010-05-08T18:01:00.000Z	jrib	awesome_guest	what do you mean?
2010-05-08T18:01:00.000Z	awesome_guest	jrib	what if two repositories have packages with the same given name?
2010-05-08T18:02:00.000Z	jrib	awesome_guest	higher version (unless you define a different policy)
2010-05-08T18:03:00.000Z	awesome_guest	jrib	anything bad about running vncserver as root?
2010-05-08T18:04:00.000Z	jrib	awesome_guest	probably a bad idea if you can avoid it.  I don't know how it's intended to be run however
