2010-05-15T09:45:00.000Z	tripelb		this is horrible. My display resolution popped to 800x600 when the computer froze this time. It's a Dell 19" monitor and you'd think I was blind. Please what can I do? The resolution was much bigger (I checked it) before the freeze. I have the scrollback small in xchat but this (for instance) is huge.
2010-05-15T09:46:00.000Z	stiltzkin	tripelb	classic problem. Go to a terminal (ctrl+alt+f1), log in, and do "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
2010-05-15T09:47:00.000Z	tripelb	stiltzkin	nothing changed.
2010-05-15T09:48:00.000Z	stiltzkin	tripelb	you went through the whole configuration and nothing changed? restart your computer
2010-05-15T09:49:00.000Z	stiltzkin	tripelb	it should have taken you through a menu-based configuration
2010-05-15T09:49:00.000Z	tripelb	stiltzkin	I looked at Display and it had the same limits
2010-05-15T09:49:00.000Z	stiltzkin	tripelb	sure you typed it correctly?
2010-05-15T09:49:00.000Z	stiltzkin	tripelb	with the sudo
2010-05-15T09:50:00.000Z	tripelb	stiltzkin	this time it didnt ask for my password so it must have been right.
2010-05-15T09:50:00.000Z	tripelb	stiltzkin	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2010-05-15T09:50:00.000Z	stiltzkin	tripelb	and what does it do? just goes back to the prompt?
2010-05-15T09:50:00.000Z	tripelb	stiltzkin	right, back to the prompt
2010-05-15T09:51:00.000Z	stiltzkin	tripelb	that's not good...
2010-05-15T09:52:00.000Z	stiltzkin	tripelb	try running sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
2010-05-15T09:53:00.000Z	stiltzkin	tripelb	and then the reconfigure command
2010-05-15T09:55:00.000Z	tripelb	stiltzkin	I looked in my notes and for the other monitor I did this (sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg) but I didnt change anything, just plugged in this other dell with the same resolution.
2010-05-15T09:56:00.000Z	stiltzkin	tripelb	so you're using a different monitor now?
2010-05-15T09:58:00.000Z	tripelb	stiltzkin	now I am in a terminal only mode. LOL I know irssi. what has been done?
2010-05-15T09:58:00.000Z	stiltzkin	tripelb	now try sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2010-05-15T09:59:00.000Z	stiltzkin	tripelb	yep
2010-05-15T10:03:00.000Z	tripelb	stiltzkin	xserver-org is not installed and when I tried to install it (apt-get install) it could not be found.
