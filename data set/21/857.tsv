2011-05-07T06:42:00.000Z	newbieneedshelp		well, so no clue about dual monitors with nvidia?
2011-05-07T06:42:00.000Z	S4RY	newbieneedshelp	which NVidia you activeted ?
2011-05-07T06:43:00.000Z	newbieneedshelp		s4ry: the "(Current Version)" one, but it's listed as "Activated but not currently in use" is this a problem?
2011-05-07T06:44:00.000Z	S4RY	newbieneedshelp	if it's activated , it should be the one in used.
2011-05-07T06:46:00.000Z	newbieneedshelp		s4ry: well, it looks like it's set up correctly but the "additional driver page" has that text listed (that is 'activated but not currently in use') I'm really not Linux savvy enough to understand whether this is significant or not
2011-05-07T06:46:00.000Z	newbieneedshelp		oh well, I guess I'll just keep googling it up, at least I know how to restore the defaults now
2011-05-07T06:48:00.000Z	S4RY	newbieneedshelp	, i meant to ask to see if nvidia glx is on the list. the glx might do it.  take a look http://www.ubuntugeek.com/dual-monitors-with-nvidia.html
2011-05-07T06:50:00.000Z	newbieneedshelp		s4ry: when running sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx I get error "E: Package 'nvidia-glx' has no installation candidate" - so I don't know how to proceed with that article
2011-05-07T06:53:00.000Z	S4RY	newbieneedshelp	but i won't urge for the nvidia-glx , we might find another method as a workaround.
2011-05-07T06:53:00.000Z	S4RY	newbieneedshelp	ah , there is a differ version for glx.
2011-05-07T06:55:00.000Z	newbieneedshelp	S4RY	I apologize I'm not sure I'm following :(
2011-05-07T06:56:00.000Z	newbieneedshelp		maybe I should read this article : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NvidiaMultiMonitors
2011-05-07T06:56:00.000Z	S4RY	newbieneedshelp	scratch that nvidia-glx method.
2011-05-07T06:57:00.000Z	S4RY	newbieneedshelp	that what i was looking for , an Ubuntu documentations , yes .
2011-05-07T06:58:00.000Z	newbieneedshelp	S4RY	It looks like I already tried most of the things the article suggests but still I'll try to follow their instructions and see if I get any different results
2011-05-07T06:58:00.000Z	newbieneedshelp		Thanks for all the help so far!
2011-05-07T07:01:00.000Z	S4RY	newbieneedshelp	which article have you followed ?
2011-05-07T07:02:00.000Z	newbieneedshelp	S4RY	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NvidiaMultiMonitors - but I tried using 'seperate X screen' rather than TwinView, I'll give 'TwinView' a try
2011-05-07T07:02:00.000Z	newbieneedshelp	S4RY	Oh yeay!
2011-05-07T07:02:00.000Z	S4RY		ah, alright good luck with that. ;)
2011-05-07T07:02:00.000Z	newbieneedshelp	S4RY	TwinView works ! no reboot required!
