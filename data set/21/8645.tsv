2007-05-26T05:59:00.000Z	DavidHKMrPowers		anyone has experience in setting up a server at home? is a UPS needed?
2007-05-26T06:00:00.000Z	Morten_	DavidHKMrPowers	an UPS is needed if you want the server to be running during a powerfailure, otherwise no.
2007-05-26T06:01:00.000Z	DavidHKMrPowers	Morten_	is a broadband connection good enough for uptime?
2007-05-26T06:02:00.000Z	Morten_	DavidHKMrPowers	I would say it is good enough for a server running 24/7.
2007-05-26T06:02:00.000Z	Morten_	DavidHKMrPowers	the connection I used was a normal ASDL connection.
2007-05-26T06:03:00.000Z	DavidHKMrPowers	Morten_	what's the outgoing bandwidth?
2007-05-26T06:03:00.000Z	Morten_	DavidHKMrPowers	512kbit
2007-05-26T06:07:00.000Z	DavidHKMrPowers	Morten_	what can a 512 kbit bandwidth do for a server?
2007-05-26T06:08:00.000Z	Morten_	DavidHKMrPowers	what do you mean, do for a server?
2007-05-26T06:09:00.000Z	DavidHKMrPowers	Morten_	is the going bandwidth too little for a server?
2007-05-26T06:10:00.000Z	Morten_	DavidHKMrPowers	-- ohh.. well, I used my server for FTP, www, mailserver, irc-bouncer, irc-bots, and some other stuff
2007-05-26T06:11:00.000Z	Morten_	DavidHKMrPowers	but it depends very much on what you what to do with the server -- what kind of apps. you will be running.
2007-05-26T06:13:00.000Z	DavidHKMrPowers	Morten_	oops! even a ftp server  the download speed is awful, right?
2007-05-26T06:13:00.000Z	DavidHKMrPowers	Morten_	i need to make a CMS
2007-05-26T06:14:00.000Z	Morten_	DavidHKMrPowers	well, the download speed was not that good, so I think you might wanna consider more upload-bw, if you're going to run a CMS...
2007-05-26T06:16:00.000Z	DavidHKMrPowers	Morten_	yes...but a dedicated line is very expensive...
2007-05-26T06:17:00.000Z	Morten_	DavidHKMrPowers	that is very true :) -- But, if the CMS doesn't include alot of graphics, a 512kbit should be enough.
2007-05-26T06:18:00.000Z	Morten_	DavidHKMrPowers	but I haven't got a lot of experience with CMS, so im a little on soft ground.
2007-05-26T06:19:00.000Z	DavidHKMrPowers	Morten_	your right a CMS without much graphics doesn't use much bw
2007-05-26T06:22:00.000Z	Morten_	DavidHKMrPowers	are you going to make your own CMS, or a allready made one? -- If you're going to use a allready made one, you could try at their FAQ, about the generated traffic.
2007-05-26T06:30:00.000Z	DavidHKMrPowers	Morten_	i use Joomla
