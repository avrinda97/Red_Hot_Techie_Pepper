2006-07-23T13:28:00.000Z	Tonren		Hey guys, what packages should I install if I need to buidl GTK dev apps?
2006-07-23T13:30:00.000Z	Tonren		What package do I need to download to enable the "autoheader" command?
2006-07-23T13:31:00.000Z	Tonren		Thanks Seveas
2006-07-23T13:31:00.000Z	theCore	Tonren	sudo apt-get build-dep "the name of the package that you're trying to build"
2006-07-23T13:33:00.000Z	Tonren	theCore	I'm trying to build GNOME Clipboard Manager Applet from source
2006-07-23T13:33:00.000Z	Tonren	theCore	Now I'm getting an error in make: configure.in:80: m4_popdef: undefined macro: AC_Dest.
2006-07-23T13:35:00.000Z	theCore	Tonren	what is the home page of the applet project?
2006-07-23T13:36:00.000Z	Tonren	theCore	http://gcm.sourceforge.net/
2006-07-23T13:44:00.000Z	theCore	Tonren	it looks really broken
2006-07-23T13:44:00.000Z	Tonren	theCore	You mean, the app does?
2006-07-23T13:45:00.000Z	theCore	Tonren	well, the autoconf script use deprecated templates
2006-07-23T13:46:00.000Z	theCore	Tonren	although, it's building now
2006-07-23T13:46:00.000Z	Tonren	theCore	I still can't install libgtk2.0-dev
2006-07-23T13:48:00.000Z	theCore	Tonren	do mind waiting a little, so I can build a debian package for it
2006-07-23T13:48:00.000Z	Tonren	theCore	Why, I wouldn't mind at all. That'd be awfully nice of you.
2006-07-23T13:48:00.000Z	theCore	Tonren	:)
2006-07-23T13:51:00.000Z	theCore	Tonren	hmm, doesn't build
2006-07-23T13:51:00.000Z	Tonren	theCore	The app itself is probably just broken.  It's all good, though - Zealot linked me to a binary for an app called "glipper"
2006-07-23T13:52:00.000Z	theCore	Tonren	probably a better choice
2006-07-23T13:52:00.000Z	Tonren	theCore	Aye.
2006-07-23T13:53:00.000Z	theCore	Tonren	they even use Ubuntu :-) http://sourceforge.net/project/screenshots.php?group_id=167085
