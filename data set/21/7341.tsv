2007-05-03T14:10:00.000Z	strabes	slim	like what?
2007-05-03T14:12:00.000Z	strabes	slim	there are tons of repositories... especially if you use a distro other than ubuntu...you can get repos located close to your house etc...
2007-05-03T14:13:00.000Z	strabes	slim	you could also check this page: http://psychocats.net/ubuntu/sources
2007-05-03T14:14:00.000Z	strabes	slim	i recommend you just copy one of those sources.list files according to your version of ubuntu and use it
2007-05-03T14:14:00.000Z	strabes	slim	good to hear
2007-05-03T14:16:00.000Z	strabes	slim	what do you mean?
2007-05-03T14:17:00.000Z	strabes	slim	should be in applications -> games
2007-05-03T14:18:00.000Z	strabes	slim	it's not "apt-get" that has the programs, it's your repositories.
2007-05-03T14:18:00.000Z	strabes	slim	apt-get is just a utility to install programs from the command line
2007-05-03T14:18:00.000Z	strabes	slim	if you downloaded it with apt-get then it is in your repositories
