2010-02-12T02:13:00.000Z	guntbert	BluesKaj	thats not needed
2010-02-12T02:14:00.000Z	guntbert	BluesKaj	but it is a *bad habit* to use sudo for everything - and we don't want others to assume it :)
2010-02-13T01:58:00.000Z	BluesKaj	guntbert	what's the problem ?, MindVirus is the one asking for help
2010-02-13T01:59:00.000Z	guntbert	BluesKaj	nothing to do with your help for him :)
2010-02-13T02:01:00.000Z	guntbert	BluesKaj	I beg your pardon?
2010-04-21T22:12:00.000Z	guntbert	BluesKaj	wrong window? :)
2010-04-21T22:13:00.000Z	BluesKaj	guntbert	Guest84312 asked how to login on irrssi
2010-04-21T22:14:00.000Z	guntbert	BluesKaj	sorry, I thought you wanted to redirect that person from another channel to here :)
2010-04-21T22:14:00.000Z	BluesKaj	guntbert	np ?
2010-11-14T03:58:00.000Z	guntbert	BluesKaj	usually a user who ran a GUI app with sudo instead of gksudo :-)
2010-12-26T00:31:00.000Z	BluesKaj	guntbert	it's not much point , his english comprehension is rather limited
2010-12-26T00:31:00.000Z	guntbert	BluesKaj	noted
2011-03-08T00:29:00.000Z	guntbert	BluesKaj	not here please
2011-03-08T00:30:00.000Z	BluesKaj	guntbert	 had to , lighten up pls, it was only one word
2011-03-08T00:49:00.000Z	guntbert	BluesKaj	the debate is not aptitude vs apt  but aptitude vs apt-get, both are front ends for apt
2011-04-07T00:36:00.000Z	guntbert	BluesKaj	don't recommend sudo without knowing what the script does
2011-04-07T00:40:00.000Z	BluesKaj	guntbert	I thought it was a std script
2011-04-07T00:42:00.000Z	BluesKaj	guntbert	and I found a better idea anyway , open ~/,bashrc and create an alias for it
2011-04-07T00:43:00.000Z	guntbert	BluesKaj	I try to not assume things - yes I saw :)
2012-07-02T23:23:00.000Z	BluesKaj	guntbert	what's the text editor in unity now , I'm surprissed gksudo gedit didn't work
2012-07-02T23:25:00.000Z	guntbert	BluesKaj	I sometimes use gedit, it works with gksudo - just tried it :)
