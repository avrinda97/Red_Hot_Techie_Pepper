2007-07-19T08:52:00.000Z	Arso	nerdygirl_ellie	hahahah. i actually laughed, thank you
2007-07-19T08:53:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie	Arso	really though, you can install from CD or DVD.  It depends on how much time you want to spend downloading.
2007-07-19T08:54:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie	Arso	irc client, yes, gaim.
2007-07-19T08:54:00.000Z	Arso	nerdygirl_ellie	gaim , didnt it become pidgin or something :P
2007-07-19T08:55:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie	Arso	The time spent downloadint Ubuntu on DVD seems wasted to me, because you are just going to redownload most of the files again when you update.
2007-07-19T08:55:00.000Z	Arso	nerdygirl_ellie	i am already almost done with the CD
2007-07-19T08:55:00.000Z	Arso	nerdygirl_ellie	i'll download the stuff manually when i update i guess.
2007-07-19T08:55:00.000Z	Arso	nerdygirl_ellie	does it auto update?
2007-07-19T08:56:00.000Z	Arso	nerdygirl_ellie	does ubuntu read/write on ntfs?
2007-07-19T08:56:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie	Arso	yes.  It's automatic!
2007-07-19T08:56:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie	Arso	Yes.
2007-07-19T08:56:00.000Z	Arso	nerdygirl_ellie	phew!
2007-07-19T08:56:00.000Z	Arso	nerdygirl_ellie	but can i make the primary partition ntfs too, instead of ext3?
2007-07-19T08:56:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie	Arso	No.
2007-07-19T08:57:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie	Arso	that's a no with an *, the * is for you might be able to if you were an uberpenguin, but then you wouldn't want to.
