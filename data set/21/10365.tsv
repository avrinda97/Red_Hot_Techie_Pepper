2005-04-05T05:12:00.000Z	Absenth	stephen_	yes, but I believe you have to convert it to a .deb with a program called alien
2005-04-05T05:12:00.000Z	Absenth	stephen_	you're a lot better off finding the .deb package, or using apt-get to find what you want though.
2005-04-05T05:13:00.000Z	Absenth	stephen_	I'm running 4.3, via point2play
2005-04-05T05:14:00.000Z	Absenth	stephen_	if you log into your transgaming account, there certianly is a cedega_4.2.1-1_i386.deb file
2005-04-05T05:35:00.000Z	Absenth	stephen_	if you actually purchased the program for the super expensive price of $5, you'd get all the support documents in the world, and contribute to the betterment of gaming on linux, rather then leech.....  but that's just my opinion, I could be wrong.
2005-04-05T05:36:00.000Z	Absenth	stephen_	wow....  that FPOS software is running SWG on my second pc right now as I type this.
2005-04-05T05:43:00.000Z	Absenth	stephen_	I recomend you JFGI, or maybe even RTFM
2005-04-05T05:45:00.000Z	Absenth	stephen_	and you get access to all the documents, as well as the support forums that are cedega specific?
2005-04-05T05:48:00.000Z	Absenth	stephen_	if it's so hard, load up windows xp again.
2005-04-05T05:50:00.000Z	Absenth	stephen_	fastest way to learn anything in linux.
2005-04-05T05:50:00.000Z	Absenth	stephen_	chances are people aren't going to do anything for you if you don't do some research first.
