2005-01-08T15:47:00.000Z	YorHel	valberg	same problem here, it's because of a warty-hoary-package conflict

2005-01-08T15:48:00.000Z	valberg		well.. then i have to run apt-get style... well that just reminds me of my days with debian :D
2005-01-08T15:48:00.000Z	YorHel	valberg	does your login-screen still works?
2005-01-08T15:48:00.000Z	valberg		well for now...

2005-01-08T15:50:00.000Z	YorHel	valberg	that might work :)
2005-01-08T15:50:00.000Z	valberg	YorHel	someone on ubuntuforums did that, and that worked
