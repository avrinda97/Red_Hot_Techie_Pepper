2009-11-24T04:30:00.000Z	osirisx11		is ubuntu netbook remix optimized for SDD and low writes?
2009-11-24T04:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	osirisx11	just format it ext2, lot less writes
2009-11-24T04:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	osirisx11	its just a different frontend, its still ubuntu like the rest
2009-11-24T04:42:00.000Z	osirisx11	ActionParsnip	ty
2009-11-24T04:44:00.000Z	osirisx11	ActionParsnip	i think this is the one ChogyDan was referencing http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/22475/
2009-12-13T05:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	osirisx11	change swappiness to between 1 to 5
2009-12-13T05:27:00.000Z	osirisx11	ActionParsnip	what is swappiness?
2009-12-13T05:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	osirisx11	its the amount of stuff ther OS will put in swap as a percentage, swappiness means do not use swap unless it is absolutely needed
2009-12-13T05:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	osirisx11	if you never max out your ram you can make the system smoother by not using swap so much
2009-12-13T05:29:00.000Z	osirisx11	ActionParsnip	can you give me something more i can google besides swappiness? I really appreciate the advice but i am unsure what to look for to do it
2009-12-13T05:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	osirisx11	i like to give it a bit of swappiness just incase

2009-12-13T05:31:00.000Z	osirisx11	ActionParsnip	thank you
2009-12-13T05:32:00.000Z	osirisx11	ActionParsnip	i LOL at the detailed instruction and pic on how to open terminal, hahah
2009-12-13T05:37:00.000Z	osirisx11	ActionParsnip	any idea why they want me to edit the rc file specifically with mousepad? why not gedit?
2010-04-23T08:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	osirisx11	you will update seemlessly to the rc and beyond
2012-06-16T08:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	osirisx11	boot to root recovery and do it there
2012-06-16T08:26:00.000Z	osirisx11	ActionParsnip	will i be able to log in? concerned over it forgetting my password and encrypted home directory
2012-06-16T08:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	osirisx11	home isn't needed for upgrades
2012-06-16T08:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	osirisx11	and /root (by standard) is in the rootfs in its own folder so you can do stuff in recovery :)
