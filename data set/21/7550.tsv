2006-09-04T11:47:00.000Z	cafuego		it's enabled already.
2006-09-04T11:49:00.000Z	freesun	cafuego	and what about message from log : Sep  4 00:03:11 ubuntu kernel: No module symbols loaded - kernel modules not enabled.
2006-09-04T11:50:00.000Z	cafuego	freesun	What kernel is that?
2006-09-04T11:51:00.000Z	freesun	cafuego	standard 6_06 updated via i-net
2006-09-04T11:51:00.000Z	freesun	cafuego	automatic ubuntu update
2006-09-04T11:51:00.000Z	cafuego	freesun	What does 'uname -r' say about it?
2006-09-04T11:52:00.000Z	freesun	cafuego	2.6.15-26-386
2006-09-04T11:52:00.000Z	cafuego	freesun	Ah hold on, I think these kernels handle module loading via udev and not kmod.
2006-09-04T11:53:00.000Z	cafuego	freesun	BUT they are modular kernels.
2006-09-04T11:53:00.000Z	freesun	cafuego	so that's why modprobe doesn't seem to work for me and editing /etc/modules either?
2006-09-04T11:55:00.000Z	cafuego	freesun	No... even if the kernel module loader isn't enabled, the kernel cna still load modules (eg: mine does).  Soemthing else is wrong with yours; it reckons it can't find its symbols... does /boot/System.map-2.6.15-26-386 exist?
2006-09-04T11:55:00.000Z	freesun	cafuego	only this file:///boot/System.map-2.6.15-23-386
2006-09-04T11:56:00.000Z	freesun	cafuego	I guess that is no
2006-09-04T11:57:00.000Z	cafuego	freesun	Ok, force the new kernel to reinstall.
2006-09-04T11:57:00.000Z	freesun	cafuego	how?
2006-09-04T11:58:00.000Z	cafuego	freesun	(and check that /boot is not full)
2006-09-04T11:58:00.000Z	cafuego	freesun	'sudo apt-get install --reinstall linux-image-2.6.15-26-386'
2006-09-04T12:00:00.000Z	freesun	cafuego	and why it could be that I can load module via modprobe (for my via-ac97 soundcard) and soundcard doesn't apper in system->preferences->sound and I cannot therefore choose it and use it? loading module makes no errors
2006-09-04T12:03:00.000Z	freesun	cafuego	down for reboot to new apply new kernel
2006-09-04T12:08:00.000Z	freesun	cafuego	well I have reinstalled kernel
2006-09-04T12:08:00.000Z	freesun	cafuego	what do you suggest?
