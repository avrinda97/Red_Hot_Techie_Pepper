2006-05-25T11:02:00.000Z	Tuzlo		tryin to install php5 on ubuntu, I apt-get installed phpd but phpinfo still tells me that 4.4.0-3ubuntu2, is this an apache problem or did I miss something in php5?
2006-05-25T11:02:00.000Z	Tuzlo		phpd=php5
2006-05-25T11:03:00.000Z	Tuzlo		restarted apache, but didnt uninstall php4
2006-05-25T11:03:00.000Z	Tuzlo		remove wont get rid of all php4 packages will it?
2006-05-25T11:04:00.000Z	Tuzlo		ah
2006-05-25T11:05:00.000Z	Tuzlo		gotta love that, removed php4, and phpinfo still says 4.4.0-3ubuntu2
2006-05-25T11:05:00.000Z	Tuzlo		yes I did
2006-05-25T11:05:00.000Z	Tuzlo		4 only
2006-05-25T11:05:00.000Z	Tuzlo		ok
2006-05-25T11:05:00.000Z	elkbuntu	Tuzlo	so you did apache -k restart or apache2 -k restart
2006-05-25T11:07:00.000Z	Tuzlo	elkbuntu	.etc/init.d/apache stop then started
2006-05-25T11:07:00.000Z	Tuzlo		now its fucked up royally
2006-05-25T11:07:00.000Z	elkbuntu	Tuzlo	apache -k restart should be all you need :)
2006-05-25T11:07:00.000Z	elkbuntu		unless thats an apache2-only thingo
2006-05-25T11:08:00.000Z	elkbuntu	Tuzlo	try it to see, alot easier than remembering the path
2006-05-25T11:08:00.000Z	Tuzlo		I dont have apache2 installed
2006-05-25T11:08:00.000Z	elkbuntu	Tuzlo	see what FliesLikeABrick said
2006-05-25T11:08:00.000Z	Tuzlo		and apache -k restart, stop or start gives me a help menu
2006-05-25T11:09:00.000Z	Tuzlo		thought so
2006-05-25T11:09:00.000Z	Tuzlo		but anyway
2006-05-25T11:09:00.000Z	elkbuntu	Tuzlo	you should probably run apache2 over apache anyway, since it's newer and all
