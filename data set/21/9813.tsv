2005-07-13T10:54:00.000Z	Gourami		evening all, I am about to install Hoary and 2003 server on the same machine, anything I should know before I begin ??

2005-07-13T10:55:00.000Z	reka	Gourami	2003 as in windows?
2005-07-13T10:56:00.000Z	reka	Gourami	hav eyou set up partitions already?
2005-07-13T10:57:00.000Z	reka	Gourami	install windows first
2005-07-13T10:57:00.000Z	Gourami	reka	can I make ntfs or stick to fat32
2005-07-13T10:57:00.000Z	reka	Gourami	ah, then leave some space for ubuntu.
2005-07-13T10:57:00.000Z	reka	Gourami	if you want r/w access then use FAT32.
2005-07-14T09:41:00.000Z	reka	Gourami	depends on the codec
2005-07-14T09:41:00.000Z	Gourami	reka	its a new installation so I need most, mp3/mpg/dvd
2005-07-14T09:42:00.000Z	reka	Gourami	check out the RestrictedFormats page on the wiki
2005-07-14T09:52:00.000Z	Gourami	reka	the wiki says nothing about music player ?
2005-07-14T09:53:00.000Z	reka	Gourami	mp3 support: install beep-media-player/xmms that come with their own codec or install gstreamer0.8-mad for mp3 support in totem
2005-07-14T09:53:00.000Z	reka	Gourami	for video codecs:
2005-07-14T09:54:00.000Z	reka	Gourami	or again, install something like xine-ui or vlc.  they come with their own codecs
2005-07-14T10:17:00.000Z	reka	Gourami	try both. :)   but i've seen vlc recommended more
2005-07-20T10:52:00.000Z	reka	Gourami	we heard the first time...if someone knows they'll answer. :)
2005-07-20T10:52:00.000Z	Gourami	reka	I know someone knows, just waiting for them to speak up
2005-07-20T11:34:00.000Z	reka	Gourami	chicken-soup
