2007-11-26T11:14:00.000Z	cabrioleur	Creed	details
2007-11-26T11:16:00.000Z	Creed	cabrioleur	what kind of details?
2007-11-26T11:17:00.000Z	cabrioleur	Creed	details about your problem. Card manufacturer, system, drivers, credit card number, SSN and date of birth.
2007-11-26T11:18:00.000Z	Creed	cabrioleur	cs4231 is the sound card, system is a dell workstation 41 (ancient i know, its a server though), drivers..modprobe doesnt seem to do anything...credit card number 421HEY! :)
2007-11-26T11:21:00.000Z	cabrioleur	Creed	are your drivers installed? Can you manipulate volume?
2007-11-26T11:21:00.000Z	Creed	cabrioleur	alsamixer doesnt even start
2007-11-26T11:21:00.000Z	cabrioleur	Creed	I think it's easy
2007-11-26T11:21:00.000Z	Creed	cabrioleur	alsamixer: function snd_ctl_open failed for default: No such device | /dev/dsp doesnt exist
2007-11-26T11:22:00.000Z	Creed	cabrioleur	es? i have a cs4231 chipset
2007-11-26T11:24:00.000Z	Creed	cabrioleur	any other ideas? modprobe snd-cs4231 works but doesnt output anything (im guessing its working).
2007-11-26T11:25:00.000Z	cabrioleur	Creed	"sudo modprobe snd-cs4231"
2007-11-26T11:25:00.000Z	Creed	cabrioleur	nada :-/ I had sound working about a week ago...reboot then it stopped, I don't think I did anything aside from update webmin and give the box a .net hostname.
2007-11-26T11:26:00.000Z	Creed	cabrioleur	doing that doesnt give any feedback, just does it and puts me back to terminal on a new line.
2007-11-26T11:26:00.000Z	Creed	cabrioleur	same error
2007-11-26T11:27:00.000Z	Creed	cabrioleur	aplay -l says no soundcards found as well.
2008-01-01T14:53:00.000Z	cabrioleur	Creed	happy new year!!
2008-01-01T14:53:00.000Z	Creed	cabrioleur	lol dankies :D
