2006-12-19T09:33:00.000Z	ken	kanzie	Can you do a favour for your PC (do we call it that here?) and not use that resource hog?
2006-12-19T09:34:00.000Z	kanzie	ken	sorry dude, dont really have any performance-issues with when running SUNs JRE... however on Windows I wouldnt touch it for the world
2006-12-19T09:35:00.000Z	kanzie	ken	also, there are hardly any good alternatives on Linux since uTorrent doe snot exist
2006-12-19T09:35:00.000Z	ken	kanzie	Are you castisaging Sun? <frowns>
2006-12-19T09:35:00.000Z	ken	kanzie	A ex-utorrent user like me, should use ktorrent.
2006-12-19T09:36:00.000Z	ken	kanzie	Did you try utorrent's web interface?
2006-12-19T09:36:00.000Z	kanzie	ken	neh... not on gnome
2006-12-19T09:36:00.000Z	kanzie	ken	web interface... nope, never heard of it
2006-12-19T09:37:00.000Z	ken	kanzie	When will people accpet the fact that GNOME/KDE are innocent siblings, and the programs run with no ill-feelings in either environment?
2006-12-19T09:37:00.000Z	ken	kanzie	There exists a web-interface for utorrent, go check it out
2006-12-19T09:39:00.000Z	kanzie	ken	do you have a link?
2006-12-19T09:39:00.000Z	ken	kanzie	let me find it
2006-12-19T09:39:00.000Z	kanzie	ken	it seems it needs to run a .exe still...
2006-12-19T09:40:00.000Z	kanzie	ken	so basically not for me...
2006-12-19T09:41:00.000Z	ken	kanzie	you are right!
2006-12-19T09:42:00.000Z	ken	kanzie	May i ask the reason for your reluctance to use ktorrent?
2006-12-19T09:42:00.000Z	kanzie	ken	none whatsoever
