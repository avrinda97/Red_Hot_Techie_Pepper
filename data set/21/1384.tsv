2011-03-14T00:22:00.000Z	donnib		i get a lock icon on folders in my automounted NFS share, why is that ?
2011-03-14T00:22:00.000Z	donnib		i have added the share in fstab and at the end i have rw
2011-03-14T00:23:00.000Z	donnib		the nfs share has open for eveything so no restrictions
2011-03-14T00:23:00.000Z	broyles	donnib	try adding vers=3 to the mount options
2011-03-14T00:23:00.000Z	donnib	broyles	thx, will try
2011-03-14T00:27:00.000Z	broyles	donnib	do you have the same ownership on the server and client, with the same uid (not name)
2011-03-14T00:28:00.000Z	broyles	donnib	if you do ls -la you can see who owns the files
2011-03-14T00:29:00.000Z	broyles	donnib	madsj glad to hear that ;) and not a problem :D
2011-03-14T00:36:00.000Z	donnib	broyles	i managed to do ls -la on a folder and i can see "nogroup", i guess my NAS sets that
2011-03-14T00:36:00.000Z	broyles	donnib	yep prob :)
2011-03-14T00:36:00.000Z	donnib	broyles	so what do i have to do ? i have set read / write access in the NAS
2011-03-14T00:37:00.000Z	broyles	donnib	you need to find out what permissions you need to set on the nas.. its different for all nas's
2011-03-14T00:38:00.000Z	donnib	broyles	my NAS has an option     Write-enabled hosts:  where i can type the ip address, maybe that will work
2011-03-14T00:38:00.000Z	broyles	donnib	let me guess, its a infrant/netgear ready nas
2011-03-14T00:39:00.000Z	broyles	donnib	I had loads of problems via nfs with it
2011-03-14T00:39:00.000Z	broyles	donnib	till it died (psu) it was one of the early ones :P
2011-03-14T00:39:00.000Z	broyles	donnib	so I used cifs to mount the dirs, was a lot easier longterm with it
2011-03-14T00:40:00.000Z	broyles	donnib	its slightly different.. 1 tick let me get u a url
2011-03-14T00:41:00.000Z	broyles	donnib	http://webscript.princeton.edu/~pug/faqwiki/index.php?title=Using_SAMBA/CIFS_to_access_Windows_Shares that should be a good start for you
2011-03-14T00:42:00.000Z	broyles	donnib	make sure you have samba-tools installed as well ;)
2011-03-14T00:44:00.000Z	donnib	broyles	installing just now..... :)
