2010-05-30T04:37:00.000Z	rovar		hey all, I have a rather interesting question...  I set up a usb key to install  desktop-amd64.  I can start the installer just fine but when it gets to "scan hard drives for an installer ISO image"  it fails saying it can't read from my cdrom
2010-05-30T04:37:00.000Z	rovar		i can open the shell... and the iso I want is  in /hd-media
2010-05-30T04:37:00.000Z	rovar		but I can't convince the installer to look there.. any ideas?
2010-05-30T04:39:00.000Z	rovar		oh wait a it.
2010-05-30T04:39:00.000Z	rovar		/dev/loop0 is already mounted as /cdrom and it appears to be the iso image
2010-05-30T04:39:00.000Z	rovar		is there a way to tell what image the installer is looking for?
2010-05-30T04:40:00.000Z	rovar		I made sure to use amd64 images..
2010-05-30T04:40:00.000Z	rovar		for the img and the iso
2010-05-30T04:41:00.000Z	rovar		maybe it's not the iso
2010-05-30T04:43:00.000Z	rovar		arg.. yes.. so the iso I need is mounted at /cdrom, it seems to be intact.. I will try installing from the command line to see what the installer is really after.
2010-05-30T04:43:00.000Z	repsol	rovar	yes please
2010-05-30T04:49:00.000Z	rovar	repsol	 do you know where to look for the installer debug logs?
2010-05-30T04:49:00.000Z	repsol	rovar	I can find out
2010-05-30T04:51:00.000Z	repsol	rovar	try /var/log/debug
2010-05-30T04:51:00.000Z	rovar	repsol	I'm pretty sure there wasn't a debug in /var/log when I checked, but I'll look again
2010-05-30T04:53:00.000Z	repsol	rovar	debug is a file in /var/log  "cd /var/log"
2010-05-30T04:53:00.000Z	rovar	repsol	sure
2010-05-30T04:53:00.000Z	repsol	rovar	ls -la debug
2010-05-30T04:57:00.000Z	repsol	rovar	did you find it?
2010-05-30T04:58:00.000Z	rovar	repsol	i tried to start  "expert install" but it seems to have hung while loading the image
2010-05-30T05:05:00.000Z	rovar	repsol	there is only syslog in /var/log
