2011-11-19T10:49:00.000Z	Darkhacker	jtr__	there many media players out there but showtime has many options in it for use and play many formats and even does subtitles from internet and hell of plugins and you can even rent mp3's on it
2011-11-19T10:49:00.000Z	Darkhacker		and rent adult movies if your over 18+
2011-11-19T10:50:00.000Z	jtr__	Darkhacker	sounds really cool, why is it still on git, why not a .deb ?
2011-11-19T10:54:00.000Z	Darkhacker	jtr__	because of the process of getting it setup i think but it worth it
