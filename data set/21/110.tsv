2012-09-11T13:06:00.000Z	LorSamPau_w	dalek_	the command is "xkill" =)
2012-09-11T13:13:00.000Z	dalek_	LorSamPau_w	ligthdm is NOT running.. xserver is STILL running.. God!!! help!! AAAARGGRHHH!!
2012-09-11T13:16:00.000Z	LorSamPau_w	dalek_	have you tried nomodeset?
2012-09-11T13:17:00.000Z	dalek_	LorSamPau_w	no... but I HAVE tried recovery mode, and.. I don't know why,  but the nvidia installer won't run from the recovery console...
2012-09-11T13:19:00.000Z	LorSamPau_w	dalek_	ubuntu have problems with some video cards, nomodeset helped me other time
2012-09-11T13:20:00.000Z	dalek_	LorSamPau_w	is nomodeset something I need to install? it doesn't appear to be present on my system.
2012-09-11T13:20:00.000Z	LorSamPau_w	dalek_	nope, you can set it in the grub, before loading the os

2012-09-11T13:21:00.000Z	dalek_	LorSamPau_w	any URLs are wasted on me.. I have no way to access the internet. I can only get onto IRC using irssi console client.
2012-09-11T13:23:00.000Z	LorSamPau_w	dalek_	when you are selecting the os before loading it - press F6(Other options) - there will be nomodeset option
2012-09-11T13:24:00.000Z	LorSamPau_w	dalek_	if it isn't there - you can manualy edit the os line by pressing "e" - and add nomodeset
2012-09-11T13:36:00.000Z	LorSamPau_w	dalek_	it helped me with geforce 550 ti
2012-09-11T13:39:00.000Z	dalek_	LorSamPau_w	sorry.. I forgot how to get the boot options where I can select nomodeset
2012-09-11T13:40:00.000Z	LorSamPau_w	dalek_	tap "e"
2012-09-11T13:41:00.000Z	dalek_	LorSamPau_w	oh ok... then do I type nomodeset somewhere in there?
2012-09-11T13:41:00.000Z	LorSamPau_w	dalek_	in the back of the line thet starts "linux..."
2012-09-11T13:45:00.000Z	dalek_	LorSamPau_w	that failed to achieve anything too. It still throws me into the "system is running in low-graphics mode" window... :(
2012-09-11T13:46:00.000Z	LorSamPau_w	dalek_	then i don't know how to help =(
2012-09-11T14:03:00.000Z	LorSamPau_w	dalek_	no windows at all )
