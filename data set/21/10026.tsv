2005-05-25T07:59:00.000Z	dcraven	Tron|BoRG	It's very slow.
2005-05-25T07:59:00.000Z	dcraven	Tron|BoRG	Sometimes, it just stops for a bit. heh
2005-05-25T08:00:00.000Z	dcraven	Tron|BoRG	I dunno what you are comparing it too though.
2005-05-25T08:02:00.000Z	dcraven	Tron|BoRG	Oh. Then it's worth the slowness.
2005-05-25T08:02:00.000Z	dcraven	Tron|BoRG	I thought you were thinking of Opera or Epiphany or something.
2005-05-25T08:03:00.000Z	dcraven	Tron|BoRG	I dunno if it's that or Windows is too frustrating to use.
2005-05-25T08:04:00.000Z	dcraven	Tron|BoRG	1.04 is in backports if you feel the need.
2005-05-25T08:07:00.000Z	dcraven	Tron|BoRG	I've heard nvu is acceptiable for some.
2005-05-25T08:07:00.000Z	dcraven	Tron|BoRG	Yeah it is.
2005-05-26T06:19:00.000Z	dcraven	Tron|BoRG	gconf-editor, /apps/metacity/general/reduced_resources.
2005-05-26T06:19:00.000Z	dcraven	Tron|BoRG	But it also does some other things as well.
2005-05-26T06:20:00.000Z	dcraven	Tron|BoRG	np
2005-05-26T06:21:00.000Z	Tron|BoRG	dcraven	Do I write that in terminal?
2005-05-26T06:22:00.000Z	dcraven	Tron|BoRG	Or go Applications -> System Tools -> Configuration Editor in the menu.
2005-05-26T06:58:00.000Z	dcraven	Tron|BoRG	There is a good chance you already have it if you are in GNOME.
