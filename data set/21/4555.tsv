2008-04-02T19:48:00.000Z	briareos90		ion:lemme see if i can find a chm decompiler :p
2008-04-02T19:49:00.000Z	briareos90		ion:http://archmage.sourceforge.net/
2008-04-02T19:49:00.000Z	briareos90		ion:yeah .. because as far as i know there isnt a way to directly convert chm to pdf
2008-04-02T19:49:00.000Z	briareos90		ion:or
2008-04-02T19:50:00.000Z	briareos90		ion:u might use print to pdfwriter from the chm viewer itself
2008-04-02T19:52:00.000Z	briareos90		ion:no probs :D <googleness>
2008-04-02T19:53:00.000Z	briareos90		has anyone here tried hardy beta yet ? is it stable enough for desktop install ?
2008-04-02T19:54:00.000Z	bazhang	briareos90	aye; #ubuntu+1 for that
2008-04-02T20:12:00.000Z	bazhang	briareos90	sure is there a problem?
2008-04-02T20:12:00.000Z	briareos90	bazhang	i installed the alsa-oss driver as per a faq on the forums , but still i am having problems with sound over 8000Hz
2008-04-02T20:13:00.000Z	briareos90	bazhang	so i have to stick to <= 8kHz
2008-04-02T20:13:00.000Z	bazhang	briareos90	but it still works?
2008-04-02T20:13:00.000Z	briareos90	bazhang	yeah works fine, but with real bad sound quality
2008-04-02T20:13:00.000Z	briareos90	bazhang	: :p
2008-04-02T20:14:00.000Z	bazhang	briareos90	same here
2008-04-02T20:14:00.000Z	briareos90	bazhang	: oh .. i thought it was some issue with my hardware ;)
2008-04-02T20:14:00.000Z	briareos90	bazhang	: doesnt the new nvidia glx drivers have a control panel ? liek the one you get with the official driver ?
2008-04-02T20:15:00.000Z	bazhang	briareos90	likely wont help with that though--zsnes has bad sound on mac and windows for me as well
2008-04-02T20:16:00.000Z	briareos90	bazhang	: aw :(
2008-04-02T20:16:00.000Z	briareos90	bazhang	: ubuntu makin me an rpg addict :p
