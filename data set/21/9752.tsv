2006-05-18T14:57:00.000Z	dabaR		Hey. If I connect through a router, I can get to the Net. If I connect to a cable modem, using DHCP, I can get a proper IP address, but can not resolve DNS. Also, if I try pinging by IP address, I get an error message: connect: network is unreachable. How can I fix this?
2006-05-18T14:59:00.000Z	dabaR		I have no firestarter installed.
2006-05-18T14:59:00.000Z	dabaR		iptables are empty, and my ipmasq is off.
2006-05-18T14:59:00.000Z	dabaR		Plus it all works on the same, dhcp protocol, but with a router.
2006-05-18T14:59:00.000Z	dabaR		I power cycled everything.
2006-05-18T14:59:00.000Z	Jowi	dabaR	is the computer connected straight to the cable modem or do you have something inbetween?
2006-05-18T15:01:00.000Z	Jowi	dabaR	your nameservers are wrong.
2006-05-18T15:02:00.000Z	dabaR	Jowi	that is when I am connected to the router, so it looks fine here...
2006-05-18T15:02:00.000Z	Jowi	dabaR	log into your router and see which nameservers are in use in there and put those in your resolv.conf
2006-05-18T15:03:00.000Z	dabaR	Jowi	sure, I will try that. The thing is that I can not ping out at all. Not even to IP addresses with the modem. That means no DNS resolving will fix it, but I am willingh to try. I will be back.
2006-05-18T15:03:00.000Z	Jowi	dabaR	when connected to the router, you will use the nameservers the router has got from the modem. if you are not using the router, you will not be able to connect to 192.168.0.1
2006-05-18T15:04:00.000Z	dabaR	Jowi	that is clear.
2006-05-18T15:04:00.000Z	Jowi	dabaR	(of course, it could be that the cable-modem has that address but it is more likely that the modem has got your public ip address registered instead)
2006-05-18T15:24:00.000Z	Jowi	dabaR	are your router set up to give a static ip for the computer?
2006-05-18T15:25:00.000Z	Jowi	dabaR	or, if you are using firestarter, have you enabled dhcp there (also write in the nameservers in the DNS tab)
2006-05-18T15:26:00.000Z	Jowi	dabaR	it is normal that you get a new ip address each time you connect with the modem. nothing strange in that
2006-05-18T15:27:00.000Z	dabaR	Jowi	not on cable
2006-05-18T15:27:00.000Z	dabaR	Jowi	I work tech support for this.
2006-05-18T15:28:00.000Z	Jowi	dabaR	well, it is not up to you or your router or your modem. it's your ISP that give you the public ip address. if you get different ones, it is them doing it.
2006-05-18T15:28:00.000Z	dabaR	Jowi	agreed
2006-05-18T15:29:00.000Z	Jowi	dabaR	your nameservers should not change very often though. it is usually safe to put them into firestarter or resolv.conf instead of 192.168.0.1
