2009-07-25T05:47:00.000Z	edbian	lwizardl	man xfree86 might help :)
2009-07-25T05:47:00.000Z	lwizardl	edbian	i just ran the check.sh from ati and it said i'm not running xfree86 so something is wrong
2009-07-25T05:48:00.000Z	edbian	lwizardl	I don't know what xfree86 is.  I assumed it was a package.  Is it a module or something?  What does check.sh check for?
2009-07-25T05:48:00.000Z	lwizardl	edbian	check.sh determines what version of the linux ati driver is needed
2009-07-25T05:49:00.000Z	edbian	lwizardl	AFAIK there are only 2 options.  Closed source fglrx and open source radeon.  Are there more?
2009-07-25T05:49:00.000Z	lwizardl	edbian	well the ati drivers no longer use fglrx it has a new file aticonfig
2009-07-25T05:51:00.000Z	lwizardl	edbian	i'm guessing its a type of X.Org
2009-07-25T05:51:00.000Z	edbian	lwizardl	You think xfree86 replaces Xorg ???
2009-07-25T05:52:00.000Z	lwizardl	edbian	yeah becuase they have 2 options XFREE86 or X.Org
2009-07-25T05:53:00.000Z	edbian	lwizardl	I'm googling it right now.  You're right BTW xfree86 and xorg do the same thing (implentation of the X window system)
2009-07-25T05:55:00.000Z	edbian	lwizardl	Looks like xorg is a fork of xfree86 (this happened btw before 2004)
2009-07-25T05:56:00.000Z	edbian	lwizardl	It looks like all of the distros use xorg now for licensing reasons.  I don't think you're running xfree86.  Ubuntu uses xorg
2009-07-25T05:57:00.000Z	edbian	lwizardl	Unless you installed it yourself.
2009-07-25T05:57:00.000Z	lwizardl	edbian	nope then i would need the x.org version
2009-07-25T05:57:00.000Z	edbian	lwizardl	Do you need any more help from me? :)
2009-07-25T05:58:00.000Z	edbian	lwizardl	I have a radeon 9550.  I'm using the open source "radeon" driver and it runs great!  I have also used fglrx with similar results
2009-07-25T05:59:00.000Z	lwizardl	edbian	ok does your also do video capture? because this card does atleast on windows
2009-07-25T05:59:00.000Z	edbian	lwizardl	It is not a capture card.
2009-07-25T05:59:00.000Z	lwizardl	edbian	ok mine is
2009-07-25T06:00:00.000Z	edbian	lwizardl	Good luck with it! :)
