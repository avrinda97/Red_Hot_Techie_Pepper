2012-02-22T23:32:00.000Z	Canadian1296	ummhasan	Definitely. What do you need?
2012-02-22T23:33:00.000Z	Canadian1296	ummhasan	Okay, you'll have to download the Ubuntu iso image and burn it to a disk. Do you know how to do that?
2012-02-22T23:34:00.000Z	Canadian1296	ummhasan	Okay, are you booting from the cd or inning it alongside windows?
2012-02-22T23:35:00.000Z	Canadian1296	ummhasan	Alright, you need to partition your harddrive. In the installer menu, it will say guided or manual. Choose manual.
2012-02-22T23:38:00.000Z	Canadian1296	ummhasan	Okay, are you at the manual partitioning screen yet?
2012-02-22T23:42:00.000Z	Canadian1296	ummhasan	Choose install. Ill walk you through each step
2012-02-22T23:43:00.000Z	Canadian1296	ummhasan	now I see your problem... One second.
2012-02-22T23:43:00.000Z	Canadian1296	ummhasan	Okay, instead of install, go to try.
2012-02-22T23:44:00.000Z	Canadian1296	ummhasan	In gparted, delete all existing partitions.
2012-02-22T23:46:00.000Z	Canadian1296	ummhasan	A screenshot of the gparted screen would help
2012-02-22T23:50:00.000Z	Canadian1296	ummhasan	Isn't alright, not needed.
2012-02-23T00:34:00.000Z	Canadian1296	ummhasan	I know how to mount, I need to figure out which disk it is,
2012-02-23T00:34:00.000Z	ummhasan	Canadian1296	sorry, i tried to copy paste

2012-02-23T00:52:00.000Z	Canadian1296	ummhasan	llutz: Hmmâ€¦ Any one else have any ideas?
2012-02-23T00:53:00.000Z	Canadian1296	ummhasan	Try "sudo fdisk -l" (thats a letter L)
