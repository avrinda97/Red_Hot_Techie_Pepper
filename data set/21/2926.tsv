2009-06-30T22:35:00.000Z	Sp00K	yellabs	Yes it is. 8.04 to be exact. :)
2009-06-30T22:36:00.000Z	Sp00K	yellabs	I already done that. It doesn't really help me. :S
2009-06-30T22:36:00.000Z	yellabs	Sp00K	are you sure you are allowed to change the config?
2009-06-30T22:36:00.000Z	Sp00K	yellabs	yeah. Its my server, so yes.:)
2009-06-30T22:38:00.000Z	yellabs	Sp00K	could you read this and see if it sheds any light on your issue : http://blog.andrewbeacock.com/2007/01/how-to-change-your-default-locale-on.html

2009-06-30T22:54:00.000Z	Sp00K	yellabs	http://pastebin.com/m23ccebf3 when I do 'dpkg-reconfigure -a locale'
2009-06-30T22:55:00.000Z	yellabs	Sp00K	is it set up with apache and so on? i mean would re installing be an option? or would that give you even more troubles?
2009-06-30T22:55:00.000Z	Sp00K	yellabs	It would give me alot of problems, since its an production machine.
2009-06-30T22:57:00.000Z	Sp00K	yellabs	I'm the only one who can use SSH (except for those who have chrooted ssh) and I really dont want downtime lol. I am thinking of rebooting the server friday night.:)
2009-06-30T22:57:00.000Z	Sp00K	yellabs	Maybe the last things I did, Might have effect, I hope.
2009-06-30T22:58:00.000Z	yellabs	Sp00K	since its more of an server issue, and we are not getting any where right now, woudl you mind asking it again in #ubuntu-server  ?
2009-06-30T22:59:00.000Z	Sp00K	yellabs	Not at all, thanks :-)
