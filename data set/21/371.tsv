2012-02-05T01:42:00.000Z	kapz		Ok...i'll try the Full ISO now...I have this urge to try Unity 5.2....also does ubuntu come with all the codecs or provided the option for it...the multimedia and flsh codecs and all
2012-02-05T01:43:00.000Z	kapz		What I dread is a purist distro...I tried openSuse and enabled pacman repo and the dependency mess it created was untolerable
2012-02-05T01:44:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	kapz	 slackware is rather 'pure' i guess
2012-02-05T01:45:00.000Z	kapz	MonkeyDust	NOPE......it's a beautiful distro of which you are responsible to maintain!
2012-02-19T16:30:00.000Z	kapz	MonkeyDust	All or any window I click on? or just evolution/specified apps? Thanks
2012-02-19T16:28:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	kapz	 gnome2 had alltray, trie that (i havent)
2012-02-19T16:28:00.000Z	kapz	MonkeyDust	alltray minimizes everyting(?) i guess
2012-02-19T16:29:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	kapz	 alltray minimizes the window that you click on
2012-02-19T16:30:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	kapz	 any window, just the one you click on -- mind: it was for gnome2
2012-04-29T15:21:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	kapz	 i don't now cfdsik, but i think yes
2012-04-29T15:20:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	kapz	 use gparted in the live session to partition
2012-04-29T15:21:00.000Z	kapz	MonkeyDust	will gparted do anything better than cfdisk?
2012-04-29T15:35:00.000Z	kapz	MonkeyDust	thanks!! Partitioning with gparted didn't give any error message, I hope this time it will install(it's my 4th time now!).... :)
2012-05-09T13:44:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	kapz	 ubuntu-tweak (not in the repos) does the trick
2012-05-09T14:10:00.000Z	kapz	MonkeyDust	I installed ubuntu-tweak but cannot find the option to change it....you sure it changes the boot screen background colour?
2012-05-09T14:17:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	kapz	 had to reinstall it, it's in Tweaks - Login settings
2012-05-09T14:18:00.000Z	kapz	MonkeyDust	you talking about login screen(lightDM)? coz I want to change bootsplash screen colour..
2012-05-09T14:19:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	kapz	 yes lightdm
2012-05-09T14:20:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	kapz	 explore 'login settings'
2012-06-20T15:46:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	kapz	 there's XDMCP
