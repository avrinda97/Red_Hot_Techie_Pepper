2005-03-17T17:55:00.000Z	thr1ce		so the list in synaptic is a list of packages that aren't upgraded...?
2005-03-17T17:56:00.000Z	thr1ce		where can I find packages that are available to be added through apt-get
2005-03-17T17:58:00.000Z	thr1ce		or are all of those the ones that can be upgraded?
2005-03-17T17:58:00.000Z	thr1ce		(i have the warty live CD)
2005-03-17T06:00:00.000Z	thr1ce		:P
2005-03-17T06:02:00.000Z	thr1ce		2.8.1
2005-03-17T06:03:00.000Z	thr1ce		i'm a big fan of "the best linux distro is the one that you like the best..."
2005-03-17T06:03:00.000Z	thr1ce		so, i'm trying a few out
2005-03-17T06:04:00.000Z	thr1ce		i run slackware -current, which is updated once or twice a week
2005-03-17T06:05:00.000Z	thr1ce		and apt-get is pretty stable?  i've used a few auto-updaters that can bork some deps pretty bad
2005-03-17T06:05:00.000Z	LinuxJones	thr1ce	apt-get is awesome
2005-03-17T06:07:00.000Z	LinuxJones	thr1ce	you type apt-get update (updates the package list) then apt-get upgrade (downloads and installs all updates)
2005-03-17T06:07:00.000Z	thr1ce	LinuxJones	and that is pretty reliable and efficient?
2005-03-17T06:08:00.000Z	LinuxJones	thr1ce	I bet all of your systems will be running Ubuntu within 2 weeks :)
2005-03-17T06:09:00.000Z	LinuxJones	thr1ce	I would check out www.ubuntuguide.org it answers all the basic questions about using Ubuntu for new users.
2005-03-17T06:10:00.000Z	thr1ce	LinuxJones	well, yeah...i just wanted a few specific questiosn answered, seeing as how i'm not really a linux newb
2005-03-17T06:10:00.000Z	LinuxJones	thr1ce	I wasn't trying to insult your intelligence or anything, but there is alot of good info on there with regards to how Ubuntu does things
2005-03-17T06:39:00.000Z	LinuxJones	thr1ce	yes
2005-03-17T06:42:00.000Z	LinuxJones	thr1ce	you can always take the initiative and package the latest gaim and submit it for inclusion in Ubuntu :)
2005-03-17T07:26:00.000Z	LinuxJones	thr1ce	the devs think it's too buggy for inclusion
2005-08-04T08:54:00.000Z	thr1ce	LinuxJones	yes
