2005-07-29T08:40:00.000Z	snickkers	qt2	most of the mind-numbing simple problems have the most complicated solutions
2005-07-29T08:40:00.000Z	qt2	snickkers	true enough.
2005-07-29T08:42:00.000Z	qt2	snickkers	what be your troubles?
2005-07-29T08:43:00.000Z	qt2	snickkers	oh, i see, did you unmute your soundcard?
2005-07-29T08:43:00.000Z	snickkers	qt2	I'm pretty sure I have - I did it in Apps -> Sound & video -> Volume Mixer
2005-07-29T08:44:00.000Z	snickkers	qt2	err, Volume Control
2005-07-29T08:44:00.000Z	qt2	snickkers	did you unmute all the channels? ;)
2005-07-29T08:45:00.000Z	snickkers	qt2	yes
2005-07-29T08:45:00.000Z	snickkers	qt2	I also have a tv tuner card, I dunno if that's messing with things *shrug*
2005-07-29T08:45:00.000Z	qt2	snickkers	hm, try opening a console and trying killall esd.
2005-07-29T08:45:00.000Z	qt2	snickkers	ohhhh..
2005-07-29T08:46:00.000Z	qt2	snickkers	that could very well be it.
2005-07-29T08:46:00.000Z	qt2	snickkers	forget the killall command
2005-07-29T08:46:00.000Z	qt2	snickkers	pop open the volume control, go to file > change device and see what the selected device is.
2005-07-29T08:49:00.000Z	snickkers	qt2	however, 'alsamixer' makes things more confusing, by saying that the selected devies is "Card: SiS SI7012, Chip: Realtek ALC655 trv0"
2005-07-29T08:49:00.000Z	qt2	snickkers	hm, changing the device to the other one and unmuting/raising the volume of that.
2005-07-29T08:52:00.000Z	qt2	snickkers	are you raising only the master?
2005-07-29T08:53:00.000Z	snickkers	qt2	I've raised all sliders to around 80%, and unmuted, on both devices
2005-07-29T08:53:00.000Z	snickkers	qt2	all sliders on Playback, not Capture, btw
2005-07-29T08:56:00.000Z	snickkers	qt2	my box is already open atm. should I try taking out the tuner card, seeing if ubuntu works nice and neatly without it?
2005-07-29T08:58:00.000Z	snickkers	qt2	I'm gonna try that. I'll be back in 5 mins
