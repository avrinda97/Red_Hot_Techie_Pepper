2005-01-03T16:40:00.000Z	protocol	ogra	the thing is I installed everything, but when I do modprobe nvidia it tells me that the module could not be found..
2005-01-03T16:41:00.000Z	ogra	protocol	with the right restrichted modules package ?
2005-01-03T16:41:00.000Z	protocol	ogra	I'm using hoary. So I re-installed all the packages again
2005-01-03T16:42:00.000Z	ogra	protocol	there is no working nvidia driver for xorg afaik
2005-01-03T16:42:00.000Z	protocol	ogra	ya I know. Noticed that. That's why I switched back to xfree86 ;)
2005-01-03T16:43:00.000Z	ogra	protocol	hmm, then you are on your own...thats a weird setup...to mix the distros
2005-01-03T16:44:00.000Z	protocol	ogra	I would of thought so. Everything was working at first glance of adding the hoary reps to my sources.list.  Then after I did a upgrade the 4th time, everything went to hell
2005-01-03T16:44:00.000Z	ogra	protocol	thats why everywhere is said you should not mix them
2005-01-03T16:45:00.000Z	protocol	ogra	bah... I will fix this problem one way or another
2005-01-03T16:46:00.000Z	ogra	protocol	the official statement if you mixed the distros is: either switch to hoary completely or reinstall warty
2005-01-03T16:47:00.000Z	protocol	ogra	reinstall wary from scratch and lose all my work? or do a apt-get reinstall?
2005-01-03T16:48:00.000Z	ogra	protocol	the statement from jdub (i think mdz as well) was reinstall or do a complete upgrade... i woudl agree with them here
2005-01-03T16:48:00.000Z	ogra	protocol	which would mean from scratch
2005-01-03T16:48:00.000Z	protocol	ogra	hah! lol... nah I'm ok
2005-01-03T16:49:00.000Z	protocol	ogra	I'll deal with it
2005-01-03T16:49:00.000Z	ogra	protocol	k
2005-01-03T16:52:00.000Z	ogra	protocol	didnt you say you reverted the X to xfree ?
2005-01-03T16:52:00.000Z	protocol	ogra	yup I did that
