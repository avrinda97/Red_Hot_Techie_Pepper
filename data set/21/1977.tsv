2010-02-25T19:41:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	virnik_	do you have build-essential ???
2010-02-25T19:45:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	virnik_	ok, do you have the development files for qt4?
2010-02-25T19:45:00.000Z	virnik_	arvind_khadri	sure
2010-02-25T19:45:00.000Z	virnik_	arvind_khadri	all installed
2010-02-25T19:46:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	virnik_	have you got qmake and also check if $QTDIR points to qt4 .
2010-02-25T19:47:00.000Z	virnik_	arvind_khadri	i have qt4 detected via pkg-config
2010-02-25T19:48:00.000Z	virnik_	arvind_khadri	http://pastebin.com/WeEKp81W this is verbose from configure
2010-02-25T19:51:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	virnik_	how about qt4-qmake?
2010-02-25T19:52:00.000Z	virnik_	arvind_khadri	it is in the place, why<
2010-02-25T19:53:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	virnik_	as you seem to be missing some package...
2010-02-25T19:54:00.000Z	virnik_	arvind_khadri	i know, but i dont know which one
2010-02-25T19:55:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	virnik_	hmm, got very less idea about qt packages, maybe you could try #kubuntu
2010-02-25T19:55:00.000Z	virnik_	arvind_khadri	i tried, nobody knows
2010-02-25T19:56:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	virnik_	the channel specific to package or qt itself? and also google-linux would be more helpful
2010-02-25T19:56:00.000Z	virnik_	arvind_khadri	thx for tips
2010-02-25T19:57:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	virnik_	sorry, couldnt be much of help ..
2010-02-25T19:58:00.000Z	virnik_	arvind_khadri	i suppose it does not matter. i think that something went messy about that distro upgrade from jaunty, so i will reinstall with lucid, once it comes out
2010-02-25T19:58:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	virnik_	oh ok
