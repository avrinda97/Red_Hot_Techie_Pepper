2004-09-29T15:41:00.000Z	martink		"Ubuntu includes the very best in translations"? hah, your web browser doesn't even speak my language ;-)
2004-09-29T11:57:00.000Z	martink		Install totem-xine. Then add "deb ftp://ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat/ unstable main" to sources.list. Then install libdvdcss2 (totally unsupported, maybe illegal etc).
2004-09-29T11:59:00.000Z	Llamabutcher	martink	the update looks like it installed sucessfully, but it still says package totem-xine has no installation candidate
2004-09-29T12:01:00.000Z	martink	Llamabutcher	and you removed the #s from the line with universe?
2004-09-29T12:02:00.000Z	Llamabutcher		i removed the whole line
2004-09-29T12:03:00.000Z	Llamabutcher	martink	was i only supposed to remove the # signs?
2004-09-29T12:03:00.000Z	Llamabutcher		like removed the whole line
2004-09-29T12:03:00.000Z	Llamabutcher		the whole link
2004-09-29T12:03:00.000Z	martink	Llamabutcher	yes, then add " universe" at the end of the "... warty main restricted" line
2004-09-29T12:09:00.000Z	Llamabutcher	martink	alright i did the update, it said a few files failed to update but were being ignore or replaced
2004-09-29T12:09:00.000Z	martink	Llamabutcher	that's not so good (as in "that's no improvement")
2004-09-29T12:10:00.000Z	Llamabutcher		oh
2004-09-29T12:10:00.000Z	Llamabutcher		well what could that be from?
2004-09-29T12:11:00.000Z	Llamabutcher		Failed to fetch http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/warty-security/universe/binary-i386/Packages.gz  404 Not Found
2004-09-29T12:11:00.000Z	Llamabutcher		thats the error
2004-09-29T12:14:00.000Z	martink	Llamabutcher	ah, you added universe in the warty-security line as well?
2004-09-29T12:14:00.000Z	Llamabutcher		all of them
2004-09-29T12:14:00.000Z	Llamabutcher		space then universe
2004-09-29T12:14:00.000Z	Llamabutcher		should there be no space?
2004-09-29T12:15:00.000Z	Llamabutcher		dunno
2004-09-29T12:16:00.000Z	martink	Llamabutcher	no, it's okay. I wasn't clear enough. You can remove universe from the warty-security lines to get rid of the errors. But it should work with them. Can you install totem-xine now?
