2009-09-09T17:59:00.000Z	theoros	qwyeth	different in a way which means you can't use an ISO?
2009-09-09T18:01:00.000Z	qwyeth	theoros	 there is a tool called unetbootin that will automatically change a linux installer ISO into a usable USB image
2009-09-09T18:09:00.000Z	theoros	qwyeth	you could still use an ISO to get it onto a usb drive and then install from the usb, no?
2009-09-09T18:09:00.000Z	qwyeth	theoros	You could, but it would require the extra step of converting the CD image to a USB bootable image.  The easiest way to do that is with unetbootin
2009-09-09T18:09:00.000Z	qwyeth	theoros	the .img is ready to be dumped on a USB stick, the ISO is not
2009-09-09T18:11:00.000Z	theoros	qwyeth	is this specific to ISO vs IMG, or of the offered ubuntu images?
2009-09-09T18:13:00.000Z	qwyeth	theoros	It might help if you remember that the extension (.img, .iso, etc) is arbitrary and is only a clue as to the format of the file.  I've seen files ending in .img that are actually CD images
2009-09-09T18:13:00.000Z	theoros	qwyeth	i'm aware of this. what about my question made you think i wasn't talking about formats?
2009-09-09T18:13:00.000Z	qwyeth	theoros	 The ones provided by ubuntu follow the common convention of using .iso for CD images.  .img is more generic and it's also used for floppy images and hard disk images
2009-09-09T18:14:00.000Z	theoros	qwyeth	so it would be literally impossible to use an ISO, without taking further steps, to create a live usb?
2009-09-09T18:14:00.000Z	qwyeth	theoros	I just wanted to clarify because you've been talking about .img like it's a format, but it's not.
2009-09-09T18:14:00.000Z	theoros	qwyeth	you just said it was a format.
2009-09-09T18:14:00.000Z	theoros	qwyeth	i'm fairly sure i haven't been talking about extensions
2009-09-09T18:15:00.000Z	qwyeth	theoros	No, I said that .img is a clue to the format, but it's not actually formatted at all, it's a dump image
2009-09-09T18:15:00.000Z	theoros	qwyeth	in a specific format
2009-09-09T18:15:00.000Z	qwyeth	theoros	it's correct that if you image a .iso to a flashdrive it won't boot
2009-09-09T18:16:00.000Z	theoros	qwyeth	you said, "the extension (.img, .iso, etc) is arbitrary and is only a clue as to the format of the file". i wasn't referring to extensions, i was referring to the format of the file
2009-09-09T18:16:00.000Z	theoros	qwyeth	incidentally, you've been using the extensions, not me?
2009-09-09T18:17:00.000Z	qwyeth	theoros	I apologize if I sounded condescending, what I'm trying to explain is that the IMG files aren't 'formats' at all.  They're disk dumps.
2009-09-09T18:17:00.000Z	theoros	qwyeth	anyway, you have actually answered my question, about the difference between ISO and IMG, and why ISO isn't used, so thanks
2009-09-09T18:17:00.000Z	theoros	qwyeth	i know that, but i wasn't saying that the IMG files are "formats", but that the IMG file is of a specific format
