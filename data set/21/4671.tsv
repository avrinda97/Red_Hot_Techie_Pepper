2008-03-11T01:18:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	Daviey	how to increase the gain ? i cant seem to find a good setting under volume options  .. windows had one 'gain +20 db' option
2008-03-11T01:19:00.000Z	Daviey	Linux_Fresher	the volume setting on the mic input = the gain
2008-03-11T01:21:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	Daviey	 btw, my microphone is connected to the back of pc, front jacks are empty .. i am little confused now
2008-03-11T01:24:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	Daviey	 so i turn off the front mic in options and enable something else u mean ?
2008-03-11T01:24:00.000Z	Daviey	Linux_Fresher	no, the volume setting in the gnome volume mixer for the microphone, or alsamixer = the dB gain
2008-03-11T01:26:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	Daviey	 erm .. ok .. so i have to download it or its there in ubuntu by default ?
2008-03-11T01:26:00.000Z	Daviey	Linux_Fresher	see the speaker icon near the clock?
2008-03-11T01:26:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	Daviey	 yup .. i double clicked it .. opens a mixer like  windows
2008-03-11T01:27:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	Daviey	 it says alsa mixer, but there doesnt seem to be any db gain option there
2008-03-11T01:27:00.000Z	Daviey	Linux_Fresher	change the device to the microphone and turn the volume up for increased gain
2008-03-11T01:29:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	Daviey	ok i changed it but when i use the sound recorder to test, my voice sounds back very low
2008-03-11T01:30:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	Daviey	 btw no hardware fault with microphone , works perfectly under windows .. here when i boost volume slider under microphone to MAX, i hear lot of 'noise'  but my speech is very low volume
2008-03-11T01:33:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	Daviey	  hmm .. funny , it worked perfectly  when i tried it under 'skype test call' .. but sound recorder play back has very very less volume .. any fixes ?
2008-03-11T01:34:00.000Z	Daviey	Linux_Fresher	no idea, sorry
2008-03-11T01:35:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	Daviey	 well, now after using it in skype  i restarted voice recorder and now it works fine !!   lol i thought windows was the only wierd thingy !! xD
