2012-07-10T19:51:00.000Z	xlq	Rocki34	That's bad GUI design right there. "Connection options". Connection to what?!
2012-07-10T19:52:00.000Z	Rocki34	xlq	Well it gives you once you open it
2012-07-10T19:52:00.000Z	Rocki34	xlq	gives you the options
2012-07-10T19:52:00.000Z	xlq	Rocki34	Aha, judging by the port number 9091, it wants to connect to the Transmission server.
2012-07-10T19:53:00.000Z	Rocki34	xlq	Should I change it? To what?
2012-07-10T19:53:00.000Z	xlq	Rocki34	I don't know. Maybe try putting "localhost" in "remote host".
2012-07-10T19:54:00.000Z	Rocki34	xlq	Don't you have the same thing? What are you connected to?
2012-07-10T19:54:00.000Z	Rocki34	xlq	localhost gives me some kind of 'unauthorized' error
2012-07-10T19:54:00.000Z	xlq	Rocki34	Try entering your user name and password as well.
2012-07-10T19:55:00.000Z	Rocki34	xlq	'Error: 401 Unauthorized user'
2012-07-10T19:56:00.000Z	xlq	Rocki34	Well it's a start :)
2012-07-10T19:58:00.000Z	Rocki34	xlq	I'll try another torrent client, do you know any that are good?
2012-07-10T19:58:00.000Z	xlq	Rocki34	I'm very happy with Deluge.
2012-07-10T19:58:00.000Z	Rocki34	xlq	I will be installing that momentarily.
2012-07-10T20:03:00.000Z	Rocki34	xlq	Can you quickly point me to the Deluge installation directory. It's asking me what to open the link with and I want to select Deluge.
2012-07-10T20:04:00.000Z	xlq	Rocki34	/usr/bin/deluge
2012-07-10T20:04:00.000Z	xlq	Rocki34	Almost all programs are in /usr/bin
2012-07-10T20:05:00.000Z	Rocki34	xlq	SWEET! It's working :D Thanks, man.
2012-07-10T20:06:00.000Z	xlq	Rocki34	No problem, glad I could help :)
2012-07-10T20:07:00.000Z	Rocki34	xlq	Anything I should do with Deluge to configure or anything like that?
2012-07-10T20:07:00.000Z	xlq	Rocki34	Not really, unless you want to set scheduling or throttling options.
