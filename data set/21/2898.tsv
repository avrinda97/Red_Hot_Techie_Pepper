2010-04-19T09:17:00.000Z	hmw		i told you, standard blahblah i dont want this disk anymore
2010-04-19T09:19:00.000Z	hmw		there is only this one disk, with one large partition. the other drive is the USB stick, i used to boot (because i can only put in one HDD internally, the system disk is not active now)
2010-04-19T09:19:00.000Z	ed2ef	hmw	what "dmesg | tail" says?
2010-04-19T09:19:00.000Z	hmw	ed2ef	nothing, i would have noticed as important. do you want me to grep for something special?
2010-04-19T09:20:00.000Z	ed2ef	hmw	can u use the mount command, them copy the output of "dmesg | tail" ?
2010-04-19T09:23:00.000Z	ed2ef	hmw	dude, i really can get it, on your fdisk -l says that sda1 is a fat32 partition
2010-04-19T09:23:00.000Z	ed2ef	hmw	but ur mount is trying to mount a ext4
2010-04-19T09:24:00.000Z	hmw	ed2ef	i think i used NTFS, but I am not sure.
2010-04-19T09:24:00.000Z	ed2ef	hmw	try mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 /mnt(or other mount point)
2010-04-19T09:25:00.000Z	hmw	ed2ef	http://pastebin.com/qK6qvgj0   http://pastebin.com/ADCfLjtZ
2010-04-19T09:26:00.000Z	ed2ef	hmw	but you use vfat on type?Or just put auto?
2010-04-19T09:27:00.000Z	ed2ef	hmw	your partition is a fat 32 dude, something is really wrong
2010-04-19T09:27:00.000Z	hmw	ed2ef	i strongly doubt, that i formatted fat 32... i think, some program is crying for mama
2010-04-19T09:28:00.000Z	ed2ef	hmw	idk, i never see fdisk confuse the partition type
2010-04-19T09:29:00.000Z	ed2ef	hmw	when you try "mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 /mnt" it still can't mount?
2010-04-19T09:30:00.000Z	hmw	ed2ef	http://pastebin.com/ADCfLjtZ
2010-04-19T09:31:00.000Z	ed2ef	hmw	i already saw that paste, what was the command used on this paste?
2010-04-19T09:31:00.000Z	hmw	ed2ef	the one you suggtested mount vfat etcv
2010-04-19T09:32:00.000Z	ed2ef	hmw	did your already tried "mount -t ntfs /dev/sda1 /mnt" ?
