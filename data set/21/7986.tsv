2006-06-11T15:10:00.000Z	cwolfie		cant I change it ?
2006-06-11T15:11:00.000Z	slackern	cwolfie	are you trying to write to an Windows NTFS partition?
2006-06-11T15:11:00.000Z	cwolfie		ya
2006-06-11T15:11:00.000Z	slackern	cwolfie	the reason is that the little write support that is in linux for NTFS is consider unsafe and can break things.
2006-06-11T15:12:00.000Z	cwolfie		hmmm
2006-06-11T15:12:00.000Z	cwolfie		lemme try shoving my usb drive
2006-06-11T15:12:00.000Z	cwolfie		or i will have to boot back to Xp to downlaod GeexboX
2006-06-11T15:12:00.000Z	slackern	cwolfie	if you have a fat32 (vfat) partition it will work fine but not with large files over 4gb i belive.
2006-06-11T15:13:00.000Z	cwolfie		and i cant mount DVD drive
2006-06-11T15:13:00.000Z	cwolfie		can i format a partition to fat32 using ubuntu live cd ?
2006-06-11T15:16:00.000Z	slackern	cwolfie	I belive you can do that yes, i haven't used the livecd myself but look if you can find gparted perhaps that can help you do it with a graphical interface
2006-06-11T15:16:00.000Z	cwolfie	slackern	type gparted from root prompt ?
2006-06-11T15:17:00.000Z	slackern	cwolfie	it will have to be 'sudo gparted' i guess or look for it in the menu's probably system->administration
