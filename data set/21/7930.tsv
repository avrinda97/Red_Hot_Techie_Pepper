2009-01-09T11:39:00.000Z	Rudd-O	Roasted	the volume control you want is not the PLAYBACK one, but the RECORDING one
2009-01-09T11:40:00.000Z	Rudd-O	Roasted	correct, you need to select microphone capture, and then alter the capture level.
2009-01-09T11:42:00.000Z	Rudd-O	Roasted	that's a glitch on your sound card.  look, I use kmix.  on kmix I select capture on the source I want to capture, but I DO NOT alter the volume on it to change the capture volume, there is a SEPARATE slider named CAPTURE for that.
2009-01-09T11:43:00.000Z	Rudd-O	Roasted	use kmix, fiddle around with the controls *there*.  or alsamixer -V all
2009-01-09T11:45:00.000Z	Rudd-O	Roasted	it is a program to adjust mixer levels.
2009-01-09T11:47:00.000Z	Rudd-O	Roasted	no idea, man.
2009-01-09T11:47:00.000Z	Rudd-O	Roasted	remember that having mike feedback is not the same as having mike selected for recording, nor is it the recording level of your mike
2009-01-09T11:49:00.000Z	Rudd-O	Roasted	probably because kmix has more comprehensive controls
2009-01-09T11:49:00.000Z	Rudd-O	Roasted	only if you leave it open and close your session,  then gnome would arguably save it in its session.
2009-01-09T11:50:00.000Z	Rudd-O	Roasted	what i mean is that when you log out, your programs are saved in the "session", and when you log back in, your programs are restored.  But if you never log out, then the programs may fail to be saved in the sessionl.
2009-01-09T11:52:00.000Z	Rudd-O	Roasted	wait.  you cannot hear any oputput?
2009-01-09T11:52:00.000Z	Rudd-O	Roasted	what happens when you call the callt esting service?
2009-01-09T11:53:00.000Z	Rudd-O	Roasted	did you call the call testing service?  what happened?
2009-01-09T11:53:00.000Z	Rudd-O	Roasted	I am going to have to ask you again.  What happens when you call the call testing service?
2009-01-09T11:53:00.000Z	Rudd-O	Roasted	well, that was kind of an important distinction
2009-01-09T11:54:00.000Z	Rudd-O	Roasted	ok, so open your kmix mixer
2009-01-09T11:54:00.000Z	Rudd-O	Roasted	describe that mixer to me
2009-01-09T11:56:00.000Z	Rudd-O	Roasted	awesome
2009-01-09T11:58:00.000Z	Rudd-O	Roasted	ok, up the Capture slider, check the Mic Boost checkbox, and select Mic as the recording source.
2009-01-09T11:58:00.000Z	Rudd-O	Roasted	if not, you might want to check the skype preferences panel itself
2009-01-09T12:01:00.000Z	Rudd-O	Roasted	do you have pulseaudio?  perhaps pulseaudio is fucking your skype experience up.  I know that personally I have to stop ulseaaudio before using skype
