2007-11-19T04:52:00.000Z	sysme		dr_willis, the fluxbox folder is in the root dir i guess ~/.fluxbox, but i've no access to it :/
2007-11-19T04:52:00.000Z	wanger	sysme	they go in ~/.fluxbox/styles
2007-11-19T04:52:00.000Z	sysme	wanger	and how can i access this folder ?
2007-11-19T04:53:00.000Z	wanger	sysme	open a terminal and type  cd ~/.fluxbox/styles  or open it in nautilus
2007-11-19T04:54:00.000Z	wanger	sysme	you'll need to get nautilus to show hidden files and folders somehow
2007-11-19T04:54:00.000Z	sysme	wanger	thanks will try it later
2007-11-19T04:55:00.000Z	wanger	sysme	good stuff - i found the fluxbox documentation to be quite hard work in places, but everything's there
2007-11-19T04:55:00.000Z	sysme	wanger	how can i select a style i'v put in ?
2007-11-19T04:57:00.000Z	wanger	sysme	if you right click on your desktop to get the fluxbox menu up, then select fluxbox menu, and then user styles
2007-11-19T04:57:00.000Z	sysme	wanger	when i click right @ my desktop when i'm running fluxbox, there's nothing :/
2007-11-19T04:58:00.000Z	wanger	sysme	the folder will need to be .fluxbox/styles - the . is important, the folder should already exist anyway
2007-11-19T04:59:00.000Z	sysme	wanger	jeah i'm in the folder now
2007-11-19T04:59:00.000Z	sysme	wanger	but how can i put in my styles with only the terminal
2007-11-19T05:00:00.000Z	wanger	sysme	have you managed to untar whatever you've downloaded?
2007-11-19T05:00:00.000Z	sysme	wanger	sure :p
2007-11-19T05:02:00.000Z	wanger	sysme	cool sorry, if i remember correctly there'll be a folder called styles and wallpapers in your download, just copy the contents of styles to ~/.fluxbox/styles and wallpapers to ~/.fluxbox/wallpapers
2007-11-19T05:02:00.000Z	sysme	wanger	whats the terminal command for that ?
2007-11-19T05:04:00.000Z	wanger	sysme	go into the directory containing your download, cp styles/* ~/.fluxbox/styles/ && cp wallpapers/* ~/.fluxbox/wallpapers/
2007-11-19T05:04:00.000Z	sysme	wanger	ok i'll try that :p
2007-11-19T05:05:00.000Z	wanger	sysme	really, i think it's perhaps best to get yourself familiar with the terminal before trying to use fluxbox, else you won't get much done =P
2007-11-19T05:11:00.000Z	sysme	wanger	and how do i set the style ? @ fluxbox
