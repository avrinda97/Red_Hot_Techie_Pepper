2007-09-03T11:22:00.000Z	cransauce		hey everybody
2007-09-03T11:23:00.000Z	cransauce		i think i have a simple probelm but i cant figure it out
2007-09-03T11:23:00.000Z	cransauce		i just installed beryl and i had to update my kernel. I tried to compile a module and got a directory error so i got build essential and kernel headers again
2007-09-03T11:23:00.000Z	cransauce		and now when i modprobe
2007-09-03T11:24:00.000Z	cransauce		i just get an error
2007-09-03T11:24:00.000Z	soothsayer	cransauce	What is the error?
2007-09-03T11:25:00.000Z	soothsayer	cransauce	What did you do to cause the error (be specific)
2007-09-03T11:26:00.000Z	soothsayer	cransauce	(What steps did you do to install beryl/headers)
2007-09-03T11:29:00.000Z	soothsayer	cransauce	 Try #ubuntu-effects
2007-09-03T11:29:00.000Z	soothsayer	cransauce	(I personally don't know)
2007-09-03T11:30:00.000Z	cransauce	soothsayer	my ubuntu effects are working ok ^__^ is there anyway to "reset" all my build and headers and stuff, reset all the settings to reflect new kernel, and re-insall?
2007-09-03T11:33:00.000Z	soothsayer	cransauce	You can force a specific version number for packages, but you shouldn't have to if you installed everything from official repostories
2007-09-03T11:33:00.000Z	cransauce	soothsayer	Im not using binaries for this, I'm compiling my own module
2007-09-03T11:33:00.000Z	soothsayer	cransauce	Ah
2007-09-03T11:36:00.000Z	soothsayer	cransauce	The module is the only thing you are compiling from source (kernel, headers, etc, are from official repos?)
2007-09-03T11:37:00.000Z	cransauce	soothsayer	i just did modinfo and the version it is compiled for is different from the kernel that i am running...
2007-09-03T11:39:00.000Z	soothsayer	cransauce	I believe you have to create a symlink to linux sources (can't find it at the moment...)
2007-09-03T11:39:00.000Z	cransauce	soothsayer	rotflol what is that?
2007-09-03T11:44:00.000Z	soothsayer	cransauce	(Sorry, I think my comment about symlinks is not helpful)
2007-09-03T11:51:00.000Z	cransauce	soothsayer	i figured it out
2007-09-03T11:52:00.000Z	soothsayer	cransauce	Heh, glad you got it fixed
