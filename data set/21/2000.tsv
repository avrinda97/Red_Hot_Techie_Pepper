2011-07-14T16:35:00.000Z	tsimpson	JoAnneOminous	read the document ubottu linked to
2011-07-14T16:42:00.000Z	tsimpson	JoAnneOminous	replace the current repositories with those from old-releases.ubuntu.com
2011-07-14T17:09:00.000Z	tsimpson	JoAnneOminous	yeah, that should be fine
2011-07-14T16:55:00.000Z	tsimpson	JoAnneOminous	did you run the command with "/etc/update-manager/release-upgrades" in it?
2011-07-14T16:55:00.000Z	tsimpson	JoAnneOminous	make sure that /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades has "Prompt=lts", then re-try the upgrade
2011-07-14T16:55:00.000Z	JoAnneOminous	tsimpson	Yes, I ran that...
2011-07-14T16:56:00.000Z	tsimpson	JoAnneOminous	you should not when you want to run LTS -> LTS upgrades, I'll fix that documentation
2011-07-14T16:58:00.000Z	JoAnneOminous	tsimpson	Okay...I updated the /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades with the Prompt=lts...but the other upgrade to karmic is ongoing...should I not-interrupt it?
2011-07-14T16:58:00.000Z	tsimpson	JoAnneOminous	as long as it hasn't started downloading, installing or removing packages, you can interrupt it
2011-07-14T16:59:00.000Z	JoAnneOminous	tsimpson	I'm pretty certain it is already...I think because I told it to...
2011-07-14T16:59:00.000Z	JoAnneOminous	tsimpson	It's performing a number of "Get" operations
2011-07-14T17:00:00.000Z	tsimpson	JoAnneOminous	then I guess you'll just have to wait, and upgrade again when it's complete
2011-07-14T17:00:00.000Z	JoAnneOminous	tsimpson	Okay...it's only another 20 minutes or so...thanks for your help...
2011-07-14T17:01:00.000Z	JoAnneOminous	tsimpson	So...when it's done do I just re-do the "sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude safe-upgrade" and "sudo do-release-upgrade" again with the new /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades ?
2011-07-14T17:02:00.000Z	JoAnneOminous	tsimpson	And should I do the "sudo do-release-upgrade" when it's done with the karmic before moving onto the LTS upgrade?
2011-07-14T17:03:00.000Z	JoAnneOminous	tsimpson	(sorry for all the annoying questions)
2011-07-14T17:04:00.000Z	tsimpson	JoAnneOminous	well do the normal package updates, then you may have to change that file back to "Prompt=normal" (as karmic wasn't LTS), then do-release-upgrade again
2011-07-14T17:08:00.000Z	JoAnneOminous	tsimpson	When it's done with the downloads I'll run the "do-release-upgrade" (having changed the prompt back to 'normal') and then change it to lts...
2011-07-14T17:10:00.000Z	JoAnneOminous	tsimpson	So, after changing back to Prompt=lts, do I need to reboot or something, or can I just jump into a new round of  "sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude safe-upgrade" and "sudo do-release-upgrade"?
2011-07-14T17:13:00.000Z	tsimpson	JoAnneOminous	you shouldn't have to reboot, no
2011-07-14T17:13:00.000Z	tsimpson	JoAnneOminous	it may be a good idea, to boot into the newer kernel etc, though
