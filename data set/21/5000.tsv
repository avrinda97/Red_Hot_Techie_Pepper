2010-08-29T12:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	diva	It sounds like some verry poorly designed windows application is overwriting grub. Right now developers need as much information about these applications as they can get; Would you be willing to help try to get this information?
2010-08-29T12:15:00.000Z	diva		sure
2010-08-29T12:15:00.000Z	diva		but what can I help
2010-08-29T12:16:00.000Z	diva	Jordan_U	how can I help
2010-08-29T12:16:00.000Z	diva	Jordan_U	plus I can't boot into window either
2010-08-29T12:16:00.000Z	diva		what should I do
2010-08-29T12:16:00.000Z	diva		help
2010-08-29T12:18:00.000Z	diva		even grub-setup -d is not working
2010-08-29T12:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	diva	First you need to get grub re-installed. The absolute easiest way to do this, if you have a blank CD handy, is to boot Ubuntu using Super GRUB2 Disk. If you don't have a blank CD or don't want to burn a CD then I think that the clearest guide for doing it from a liveCD is this one: http://grub.enbug.org/Grub2LiveCdInstallGuide
2010-08-29T12:19:00.000Z	diva		my alienware m11x does not have a cd drive
2010-08-29T12:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	diva	Ok, then go with http://grub.enbug.org/Grub2LiveCdInstallGuide
