2005-08-09T11:35:00.000Z	skalpel		tomcat_: someone told me ubuntu was originally developed for the african government, i thought maybe you meant something like that
2005-08-09T11:36:00.000Z	skalpel		so ubuntu takes everything good about debian and makes it more accessable?
2005-08-09T11:36:00.000Z	lunitik	skalpel	no... Ubuntu enables you to not think about configuring your box (package sets etc)... other than that, its Debian
2005-08-09T11:38:00.000Z	lunitik	skalpel	thats old news
2005-08-09T11:38:00.000Z	lunitik	skalpel	enless your cdrw is old
2005-08-09T11:39:00.000Z	skalpel	lunitik	no it is not. it only happens when i try to write to cd-rw, even after i blank the disc
2005-08-09T11:40:00.000Z	lunitik	skalpel	cdrecord dev=/dev/hdc speed=something --data some.file another.file  ... or --audio some.mp3 another.mp3
2005-08-09T11:40:00.000Z	skalpel	lunitik	that would take along time, i am burning a disc full of mp3 files.
2005-08-09T11:41:00.000Z	skalpel	lunitik	how would i tell cdrecord to burn a whole dir, all files in it?
2005-08-09T11:41:00.000Z	lunitik	skalpel	cdrecord dev=/dev/hdc speed=something --audio *.mp3
2005-08-09T11:41:00.000Z	skalpel	lunitik	how do i find out which device node my cd writer is using?
2005-08-09T11:42:00.000Z	lunitik	skalpel	if you purchased it from a store preinstalled, its hdc... else, its wherever you put it
2005-08-09T11:42:00.000Z	skalpel	lunitik	ok thank you
2005-08-09T11:43:00.000Z	lunitik	skalpel	hda = primary master ide cable, hdb=primary slave, hdc = secondary master, hdd=secondary slave
2005-08-09T11:43:00.000Z	lunitik	skalpel	it'll tell you right on the CDRW... the first number for first burn
2005-08-09T11:50:00.000Z	skalpel	lunitik	i got this error using cdrecord: Warning: Open by 'devname' is unintentional and not supported.
2005-08-09T11:50:00.000Z	lunitik	skalpel	then thats not where it is....
2005-08-09T11:50:00.000Z	lunitik	skalpel	I'm not there, I can't tell you where its plugged in physically...
