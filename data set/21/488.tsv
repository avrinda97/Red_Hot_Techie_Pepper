2011-12-22T06:40:00.000Z	thornhill		how do I remove windows from the bootloader options?
2011-12-22T06:40:00.000Z	edbian	thornhill	Is windows still installed?
2011-12-22T06:41:00.000Z	edbian	thornhill	you edit /etc/default/grub   but if you take it off the menu you won't be able to boot windows anymore.  Is this what you want?
2011-12-22T06:43:00.000Z	thornhill	edbian	yes, that's what I want, but can't I just comment out the line and add it back in if I so desire at a later date?
2011-12-22T06:43:00.000Z	edbian	thornhill	yes, comment out the line and run sudo update-grub
2011-12-22T06:44:00.000Z	thornhill	edbian	thanks!
2011-12-22T06:44:00.000Z	edbian	thornhill	sure, try it and make sure it works
2011-12-22T06:45:00.000Z	edbian	thornhill	My instructions are from memory
2011-12-22T06:45:00.000Z	edbian	thornhill	mmmm, yeah I think it's more complicated than that
2011-12-22T06:45:00.000Z	edbian	thornhill	what do you have in /etc/grub/ ?
2011-12-22T06:46:00.000Z	thornhill	edbian	I'm not sure, what are we looking for? I have /etc/grub.d folder...
2011-12-22T06:46:00.000Z	edbian	thornhill	sorry typo, /etc/grub.d/ contains files.  Each file is a thing in the grub menu that can be booted
2011-12-22T06:47:00.000Z	edbian	thornhill	I'm researching
2011-12-22T06:50:00.000Z	edbian	thornhill	Read number 7 here
2011-12-22T06:51:00.000Z	edbian	thornhill	removing one thing from grub 2 is a pain in the butt now!
2011-12-22T06:54:00.000Z	thornhill	edbian	read number 7?
2011-12-22T06:55:00.000Z	edbian	thornhill	ah, sorry didn't paste the link.  Here it is: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1195275
2011-12-22T06:55:00.000Z	edbian	thornhill	read number 7 there on how to remove something from the boot menu
2011-12-22T07:04:00.000Z	thornhill	edbian	my motivation is to simply remove it as an option for the staff at this nonprofit, while leaving the Windows partition intact, since they don't have Windows recovery CDs. Any suggestions to make booting Windows impossible?
2011-12-22T07:06:00.000Z	edbian	thornhill	what you're talking about is possible.  I suggesting installing the gui tool that number 7 suggests
