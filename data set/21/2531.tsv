2009-09-15T16:59:00.000Z	Nicd-		how would I tell my Ubuntu to start vncserver (Xvnc) instead of X when booting up?
2009-09-15T17:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Nicd-	 if you want a 'hidden' vnc session  thats not the current desktop. You can install/run some of the 'vncserver' servers such as tightvnc.
2009-09-15T17:02:00.000Z	Nicd-	Dr_Willis	I want it to start the vncserver in place of the normal desktop. The computer is to be used via VNC only.
2009-09-15T17:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Nicd-	 theres 2 ways to do vnc.. Share/show the current desktop OR have a hidden vnc session thats NOT visiable from the local machine.
2009-09-15T17:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Nicd-	 if you want you could set up gnome to auto-login and start  the gnome vnc feature.
2009-09-15T17:04:00.000Z	Nicd-	Dr_Willis	I tried vino but it has problems when running headless
2009-09-15T17:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Nicd-	 sound  like you want to use a 'normal' vncserver then. There are guides on making vnc auto spawn as needed when you connect via a vnc client also.
2009-09-15T17:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Nicd-	 they can spawn via inetd I recall. With the right setup
2009-09-15T17:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Nicd-	 you are not understanding how vnc works. Since you are 'headless' you dont want to use Xvnc or X11vnc. You want a normal 'vncserver'
2009-09-15T17:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Nicd-	 you could  ssh in, start 'vncserver' then connect via any vnc client..   its that easy. Once ya get vnc going.
2009-09-15T17:07:00.000Z	Nicd-	Dr_Willis	can I connect to an existing, running session with that?
2009-09-15T17:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Nicd-	 depends on how you launch.  an existing running VNC SESSIOn.. yes...
2009-09-15T17:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Nicd-	 headless means you wont have an X session going. Just vnc sessions.
2009-09-15T17:08:00.000Z	Nicd-	Dr_Willis	ok, that's an error in my part then, I thought headless just meant running without a monitor
2009-09-15T17:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Nicd-	 and with no monitor you cant see a local X session...
2009-09-15T17:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Nicd-	 so theres no need to start up X or gdm. Peronally i found 'headless' caused to many problems.
2009-09-15T17:09:00.000Z	Nicd-	Dr_Willis	basically I just want something like Microsoft's Remote Desktop: computer boots, logs in automatically, starts programs. I connect later and see that desktop with the programs running and can control them
2009-09-15T17:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Nicd-	 you can set up vncserver to do that.
2009-09-15T17:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Nicd-	 and you couls start the proper vncserver from rc.local
2009-09-15T17:18:00.000Z	Nicd-	Dr_Willis	apparently this tells me how to start the vncserver on boot: http://www.abdevelopment.ca/blog/start-vnc-server-ubuntu-boot -- but how do I stop the regular display from starting?
