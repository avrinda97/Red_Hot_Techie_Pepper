2007-04-14T09:32:00.000Z	xtknight	SpAc	yea
2007-04-14T09:33:00.000Z	SpAc	xtknight	aldin, great! Do some things remain unstyled for you? For example the update the software sources GUI doesn't use the theme
2007-04-14T09:34:00.000Z	xtknight	SpAc	yea those are root apps.  copy you theme to /usr/share/themes

2007-04-14T09:41:00.000Z	xtknight	SpAc	ah hmm
2007-04-14T09:42:00.000Z	xtknight	SpAc	there are a lot of themes based on the murrine engine actually, though
2007-04-14T09:42:00.000Z	SpAc	xtknight	it's obviously pretty popular ;)
2007-04-14T09:46:00.000Z	SpAc	xtknight	I guess I'll just wait till that site comes back up
2007-04-14T09:51:00.000Z	SpAc	xtknight	aldin, the theme now works for admin dialogues. Thanks!
2007-04-14T09:51:00.000Z	xtknight	SpAc	installing the murrine engine should be enough
2007-04-14T09:52:00.000Z	SpAc	xtknight	do your firefox form items remain unstyled?
2007-04-14T09:52:00.000Z	xtknight	SpAc	try rebooting firefox?  not all elements will be styled though
2007-04-14T09:52:00.000Z	xtknight	SpAc	google isnt styled for me
2007-04-14T09:52:00.000Z	SpAc	xtknight	yeah, drop downs etc. aren't styled. I think that is the same for all theme engines though
