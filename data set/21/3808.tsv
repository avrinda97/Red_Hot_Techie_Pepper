2010-06-18T08:11:00.000Z	gbear14275		would someone kindly try to login to my server using ssh 74.106.4.22 (just setup key based login and hoping it kicks back any password attempts)
2010-06-18T08:11:00.000Z	Valkyrie	gbear14275	I will
2010-06-18T08:12:00.000Z	Valkyrie	gbear14275	It asks me to input password
2010-06-18T08:12:00.000Z	Valkyrie		Gj.
2010-06-18T08:12:00.000Z	gbear14275	Valkyrie	thanks, will try again
2010-06-18T08:12:00.000Z	Valkyrie		Not a problem
2010-06-18T08:13:00.000Z	Valkyrie		I don't like openPGP encryption =/
2010-06-18T08:13:00.000Z	Valkyrie		Because, half the time it gets sent to people's Junkmail
2010-06-18T08:17:00.000Z	gbear14275		this is frustrating... grr... ok just disabled rsaauthentication and pubkeyauthentication and reloaded the config file and its still allowing me to login using keys... what am I doing wrong here...
2010-06-18T08:31:00.000Z	gbear14275	Valkyrie	ok... so I tested it some... turns out my initial trials were foiled when I forgot to escalate priveleges when I tried to reload the config file.   Solved that (duh).  Could you give it one more shot for me?
2010-06-18T08:32:00.000Z	gbear14275		or could anyone here give me a hand and see if I disabled password login effectively.  IP is 74.106.4.22
2010-06-18T08:32:00.000Z	gbear14275		ssh
2010-06-18T08:33:00.000Z	Valkyrie	gbear14275	I sure can
2010-06-18T08:34:00.000Z	Valkyrie		Permission denied (publickey_
2010-06-18T08:34:00.000Z	Valkyrie		)*
2010-06-18T08:34:00.000Z	Valkyrie		Good job ^^
2010-06-18T08:34:00.000Z	gbear14275		thanks again Valkyrie!
2010-06-18T08:34:00.000Z	Valkyrie		Anytime
2010-06-18T08:34:00.000Z	Valkyrie		What?
2010-06-18T08:45:00.000Z	gbear14275	Valkyrie	you still around?  Got one more question about the printing of the MOTD.  For some reason when using password login this works but after setting up keys it goes away... the nice thing was that during logons it would tell you if the server required a reboot...  is there any way to re-enable this?
2010-06-18T08:45:00.000Z	Valkyrie	gbear14275	I'm not entirely sure.
