2006-09-03T13:55:00.000Z	ompaul	ZenShado	please gather your thoughts and put them on one line, there are almost 800 here, using the enter key should be done when your full statement is made, thanks :)
2006-09-03T13:57:00.000Z	ZenShado	ompaul	Okay, I just did not know they were all there, I'm very sorry, I'm used to doing it differently...by the way, this should take like 1 hour and 30 mins.
