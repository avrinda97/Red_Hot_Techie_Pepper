2005-03-11T10:06:00.000Z	PacoBCN		good you're talking about this
2005-03-11T10:06:00.000Z	PacoBCN		I downloaded many .torrent files but I was able to download only one of them
2005-03-11T10:06:00.000Z	PacoBCN		it keeps saying Connection Error, and other kind of errors
2005-03-11T10:06:00.000Z	PacoBCN		is that normal?
2005-03-11T10:07:00.000Z	apokryphos	PacoBCN	you might want to look into port forwarding
2005-03-11T10:07:00.000Z	PacoBCN	apokryphos	thanks, but if it worked with one it should work (about port forwarding)
2005-03-11T10:08:00.000Z	apokryphos	PacoBCN	Nope. Firewall/router can remarkably slow it down.
2005-03-11T10:09:00.000Z	PacoBCN	apokryphos	no, I didn't verify it and I'll do it now :)
2005-03-11T10:09:00.000Z	apokryphos	PacoBCN	also, do your torrents definitely have a sufficient amount of seeds?
2005-03-11T10:10:00.000Z	apokryphos	PacoBCN	It's been smooth as honey for me on Ubuntu. No problems..
2005-03-11T10:12:00.000Z	apokryphos	PacoBCN	Heh. Yeah. For the port listening, you can't have any active torrents.
2005-03-30T09:57:00.000Z	apokryphos	PacoBCN	heh
2005-04-01T06:12:00.000Z	apokryphos	PacoBCN	no, it's not.
2005-04-12T09:22:00.000Z	apokryphos	PacoBCN	the upgrade is around 500 megs
2005-04-12T09:23:00.000Z	PacoBCN	apokryphos	it makes sense to save all your home directory somewhere and reinstall it, as I did
2005-04-12T09:23:00.000Z	apokryphos	PacoBCN	No, not really.
2005-04-12T09:23:00.000Z	PacoBCN	apokryphos	really? I find it much clearer
2005-04-12T09:24:00.000Z	apokryphos	PacoBCN	it saves some stuff; but essentially, there's no need to go through the whole installation process again
2005-04-12T09:24:00.000Z	apokryphos	PacoBCN	this way is certainly much quicker
2005-04-12T09:25:00.000Z	apokryphos	PacoBCN	stable -> stable apt upgrade is fully supported
2005-04-12T09:25:00.000Z	apokryphos	PacoBCN	in theory, you shouldn't have any problems (I didn't).
