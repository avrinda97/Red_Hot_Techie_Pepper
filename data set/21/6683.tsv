2007-04-27T14:22:00.000Z	deadeyes		I am doing a dist-upgrade to feisty (I probably did it from Dapper :s) and I get an error that dpkg return -1 for mysql-server. Any way I can skip mysql-server?
2007-04-27T14:23:00.000Z	Flannel	deadeyes	To dapper, eh?  That's a no no.
2007-04-27T14:23:00.000Z	Flannel	deadeyes	er, from dapper even.  I suppose english is a no no for me tonight.
2007-04-27T14:23:00.000Z	deadeyes	Flannel	no, I mean, from Dapper, to Feisty:)
2007-04-27T14:23:00.000Z	deadeyes	Flannel	could that be the problem?
2007-04-27T14:24:00.000Z	Flannel	deadeyes	right, still no good.  Shouldve gone through edgy.
2007-04-27T14:24:00.000Z	deadeyes	Flannel	too late now:s
2007-04-27T14:25:00.000Z	Flannel	deadeyes	you'll most likely have to get your hands dirty with fixing some stuff.  Does it tell you why mysql-server isn't instlaling?
2007-04-27T14:25:00.000Z	deadeyes	Flannel	no
2007-04-27T14:25:00.000Z	deadeyes	Flannel	but I want to skip it and do it later
2007-04-27T14:25:00.000Z	deadeyes		or can I uninstall it?
2007-04-27T14:26:00.000Z	Flannel	deadeyes	then just remove the package
2007-04-27T14:28:00.000Z	deadeyes	Flannel	wont that remove the data from the database?
2007-04-27T14:28:00.000Z	deadeyes		I can't permit it to loose that data
2007-04-27T14:29:00.000Z	Flannel	deadeyes	Uh, it shouldn't.  Just removing the package should keep the config/etc files, just removing the programs.  However, to be absolutely sure, you should back up.
2007-04-27T14:29:00.000Z	Flannel	deadeyes	just don't --purge
2007-04-27T14:29:00.000Z	deadeyes	Flannel	ok, thanks for your help. Just a little question... where can I find the data files?
2007-04-27T14:29:00.000Z	deadeyes	Flannel	to back it up
2007-04-27T14:30:00.000Z	Flannel	deadeyes	uh, no idea.  Heh.  You probably need to do some sort of dump via SQL/whtaever to have a usable backup anyway (export/import)
2007-04-27T14:30:00.000Z	Flannel	deadeyes	usually stuff like that doesn't work well if you just copy out the file.
2007-04-27T14:33:00.000Z	deadeyes	Flannel	that's true... mysqldump is the tool I need ;) thanks for your help
