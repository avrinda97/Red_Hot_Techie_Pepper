2007-10-13T07:38:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	John117	are you sure its failing?  or does it just seemt o freeze, the alt. install takes a long time at that step
2007-10-13T07:38:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	John117	are you getting a big red screen indicating the install has failed?
2007-10-13T07:39:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	John117	usually if i get a failure i just keep repeating till it works, i've never had to do it more than twice
2007-10-13T07:39:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	John117	hmm, dont know...
2007-10-13T07:40:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	John117	are you trying 7.04 or 7.10
2007-10-13T07:41:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	John117	dont' know, how fast are you burning the disks?.. slower the better, adn it does make a difference
2007-10-13T07:41:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	John117	what type of media, and how fast are you burning?
2007-10-13T07:46:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	John117	i asked you a question several minutes ago and you didn't respond.
2007-10-13T07:47:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	John117	then you need to prefix talking tom e with my name, i'm not gonna stare at the screen waiting on you to respond
2007-10-13T07:48:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	John117	so what type of media are you using, how fast are you burning, etc.
2007-10-13T07:49:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	John117	try slowing downt he burn speed, 2-4x is best
2007-10-13T07:49:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	John117	wel,l you obviously know everything, but let me tell you, you're wrong
2007-10-13T07:51:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	John117	i don't know what i'm talking about, sorry, can't help
2007-10-13T07:52:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	John117	the point is, when you have problems with several different ISOs, then the problem is obviously you, or somethign on your end...
2007-10-13T07:52:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	John117	either media related, burn related, or something else.
2007-10-13T07:53:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	John117	its failing at finding software to install,
2007-10-13T07:53:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	John117	try disabling apci, but i doubt that will fix it.
2007-10-13T08:06:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	John117	jsut note, i'm a cocky prick that was likely right.
2007-10-13T08:07:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	John117	we,l 8x wasn't what i suggested, but do what you want, i really don't care, my system works fine
2007-10-14T06:24:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	John117	you're opinion fo me, really matters little..
