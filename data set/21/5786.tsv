2007-08-08T06:37:00.000Z	Lopes		Can someone help me connect my Rogers highspeed to my newly installed Ubuntu? I'm very noob with this
2007-08-08T06:37:00.000Z	Pelo	Lopes	 dsl ? connected directly to your computer ?
2007-08-08T06:38:00.000Z	Pelo	Lopes	 your router shouldhve the conneciton info in it , you should only have to plug your computer in the router,  there shouldn't be any issues
2007-08-08T06:39:00.000Z	Pelo	Lopes	 are you blocking ports in your router ?
2007-08-08T06:50:00.000Z	Lopes	Pelo	sorry i got disconnected, i was trying to say it tells me im connected but wont show any websites
2007-08-08T06:50:00.000Z	Pelo	Lopes	 did you try accessing the router from ubuntu ? through firefox ? did you try another internet application like chat ?
2007-08-08T06:51:00.000Z	Lopes	Pelo	yes i tried firefox and some simple games, none will connect
2007-08-08T06:52:00.000Z	Pelo	Lopes	 did you try login into your router ?
2007-08-08T06:52:00.000Z	Lopes	Pelo	I dont have any security, and my windows xp laptop works fine when wired to the router
2007-08-08T06:54:00.000Z	Lopes	Pelo	it also blocks my wireless connection to the laptop when connected to ubuntu
2007-08-08T06:54:00.000Z	Pelo	Lopes	does your router use dynamic ip addresses or do you have to assing static ips to each comp?
2007-08-08T06:55:00.000Z	Pelo	Lopes	 maybe you should lookup your router model in the forum to see if there are any issues,  I'Ve pretty much run thru every easy thing I can think of
2007-08-08T06:55:00.000Z	Lopes	Pelo	im noob, how can i find out about my ip on the router?
2007-08-08T06:56:00.000Z	Pelo	Lopes	 just out of curiosity,  does your ISP supply the router, or did you buy it yourself ?
2007-08-08T06:56:00.000Z	Lopes	Pelo	i bought it
2007-08-08T06:57:00.000Z	Pelo	Lopes	 ok so taht rules out your ISP locking the router for only one computer,
2007-08-08T06:57:00.000Z	Lopes	Pelo	thanks ill see what i can find in the forums and ill call my isp and router manufacturer
2007-08-08T06:57:00.000Z	Pelo	Lopes	 ok I suggest you read your router's documentation but if you did nothing more then plug it in when you bought it , there shouldnT' be anything in there to keep you from  connecting
2007-08-08T06:58:00.000Z	Pelo	Lopes	 I donT think your isp is at fault,  even if it is rogers
2007-08-08T06:58:00.000Z	Lopes	Pelo	ha ha alright thanks
2007-08-08T06:59:00.000Z	Pelo	Lopes	 pay attention to macogw  he seems to know a little something
