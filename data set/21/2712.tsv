2009-07-24T03:39:00.000Z	MattPhilie		Can anyone tell me exactly what to do for this error? 'You do not have the permissions necessary to view the contents of "ircd-hybrid".'?
2009-07-24T03:40:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	MattPhilie	looks like a permission error?
2009-07-24T03:43:00.000Z	MattPhilie	Mike_lifeguard	I was just linked to that.. But there were tooooo many to choose from. How do I do it exactly? Sorry, I'm a noob
2009-07-24T03:45:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	MattPhilie	Can you show me the line for whatever you're trying to look at from "ls -l"?
2009-07-24T03:48:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	MattPhilie	Do you know what you're doing, or do you need help?
2009-07-24T03:48:00.000Z	MattPhilie	Mike_lifeguard	Huh? Sorry, I am a REAL big noob
2009-07-24T03:49:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	MattPhilie	ok, you just have to let me know you need help :)
2009-07-24T03:49:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	MattPhilie	do you have a terminal open?
2009-07-24T03:49:00.000Z	MattPhilie	Mike_lifeguard	Yes I do
2009-07-24T03:49:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	MattPhilie	ok, what is the full path to what you're trying to see? You want to do "cd /path/to/whatever"
2009-07-24T03:50:00.000Z	MattPhilie	Mike_lifeguard	I am in the /etc folder trying to view a folder inside of it
2009-07-24T03:50:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	MattPhilie	remind me what the name of it is? something about ircd?
2009-07-24T03:51:00.000Z	MattPhilie	Mike_lifeguard	it is the path: /etc/ircd-hybrid and it says You do not have the permissions necessary to view the contents of "ircd-hybrid".
2009-07-24T03:52:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	MattPhilie	ok, can you paste for me the output of "ls -l | grep ircd-hybrid"?
2009-07-24T03:53:00.000Z	MattPhilie	Mike_lifeguard	In a terminal correct?
2009-07-24T03:54:00.000Z	MattPhilie	Mike_lifeguard	I did that and it did nothing it just started a new clean line
2009-07-24T03:54:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	MattPhilie	k, just do "ls -l" and pastebin it for me?
2009-07-24T03:55:00.000Z	MattPhilie	Mike_lifeguard	OK one sec
