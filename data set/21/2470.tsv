2010-07-09T18:30:00.000Z	bluebaron_	airtonix	no you are wrong
2010-07-09T18:30:00.000Z	airtonix	bluebaron_	you actually have to click on the radiocircle
2010-07-09T18:31:00.000Z	bluebaron_	airtonix	no it is a checkbox ... i am a developer .. i know the difference .. thank you for playing
2010-07-09T18:32:00.000Z	airtonix	bluebaron_	default ubuntu theme has that as a radio selector not a check box.
2010-07-09T18:32:00.000Z	airtonix	bluebaron_	infact i think that regardless of the theme it will always be a radio widget and not a tickbox
2010-07-09T18:32:00.000Z	bluebaron_	airtonix	a radio button implies there are at least two options ... please stop talking
2010-07-09T18:33:00.000Z	airtonix	bluebaron_	no you just made a new best friend
2010-07-09T18:36:00.000Z	airtonix	bluebaron_	because i love you : http://imagebin.org/104660
2010-07-09T18:38:00.000Z	bluebaron_	airtonix	thank you for showing me how wrong you were ... you didn't read my question ... while that lets me know how to fix my issue, your telling me that i was wrong was wrong because you didn't read the question
2010-07-09T18:38:00.000Z	airtonix	bluebaron_	ragemoar
2010-07-09T18:40:00.000Z	airtonix	bluebaron_	obviously. but don't let me cause your anger to dissipate
2010-07-09T18:41:00.000Z	bluebaron_	airtonix	well i'm glad that you admit the issue wasn't with me .. that eases things .. don't pretend i'm stupid next time
2010-07-09T18:42:00.000Z	airtonix	bluebaron_	oh but if you think those two widgets aren't what i called them...lol
2010-07-09T18:43:00.000Z	bluebaron_	airtonix	because you said you had .. doesn't make sense what you're saying ... seems as though you spoke falsely
2010-07-09T18:44:00.000Z	bluebaron_	airtonix	perhaps you need an image bin?
2010-07-09T18:45:00.000Z	airtonix	bluebaron_	?
2010-07-09T18:55:00.000Z	bluebaron_	airtonix	 http://imagebin.org/104662  ... hope that clears things up for you
2010-07-09T18:56:00.000Z	bluebaron_	airtonix	i did .. it was ignorant and displayed your reading level for all to see
2010-07-09T18:56:00.000Z	airtonix	bluebaron_	oh you sailor boy, making me all hot now
2010-07-09T18:57:00.000Z	bluebaron_	airtonix	please concede that you didn't read my question and then you pretended that I was stupid when clearly you failed to remove the mote from thine own eye
