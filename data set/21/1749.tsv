2010-05-08T04:42:00.000Z	Coppermine		help me use my pci videocard please
2010-05-08T04:43:00.000Z	MikeChelen	Coppermine	what model card?
2010-05-08T04:43:00.000Z	Coppermine	MikeChelen	Realtech Hollywood +
2010-05-08T04:44:00.000Z	MikeChelen	Coppermine	try system -> admin -> hardware drivers? dunno that card
2010-05-08T04:44:00.000Z	Coppermine	MikeChelen	MikeChelen dxr3.sourceforge.net/ was the linux drivers
2010-05-08T04:44:00.000Z	Coppermine	MikeChelen	its a card for pci
2010-05-08T04:47:00.000Z	Coppermine	MikeChelen	and i already tried checking for closed source drivers but none, and yesterday i tried compiling dxr3 and kernel headers and lm sensors but got some errors with the dxr3 modules make
2010-05-08T04:48:00.000Z	MikeChelen	Coppermine	try searching ubuntuforums.org for the video card name?
2010-05-08T04:49:00.000Z	Coppermine	MikeChelen	did that too, aswell as google for a good hour :p
2010-05-08T04:51:00.000Z	MikeChelen	Coppermine	it looks like that driver is the best bet, the install process looks difficult though
2010-05-08T04:52:00.000Z	Coppermine	MikeChelen	and really outdated so what do i do with my questions about compiler errors haha, bet i'd better go win 98 with the drivers they offer
2010-05-08T04:52:00.000Z	MikeChelen	Coppermine	ubuntu should be able to run without special drivers, only 3d won't work
2010-05-08T04:54:00.000Z	Coppermine	MikeChelen	im not using 3d im on a pentium 3.... i just want my pci videocard working,l even if it is my pci vga instead of my onboard vga that would give some spark of hope
2010-05-08T04:54:00.000Z	MikeChelen	Coppermine	what happens if you try booting live cd?
2010-05-08T04:55:00.000Z	Coppermine	MikeChelen	works fine, and shows it on my onboard vga out not on my pci vga out
2010-05-08T04:56:00.000Z	MikeChelen	Coppermine	check the system bios and try to disable the onboard video?
2010-05-08T04:57:00.000Z	Coppermine	MikeChelen	would that work? since it should be recognised if i boot with only a screen connected to my pci vga?
2010-05-08T04:58:00.000Z	MikeChelen	Coppermine	yup hopefully, the bios may also have a setting to pick between them
2010-05-08T04:58:00.000Z	Coppermine	MikeChelen	i checked there is not, and im not thinking about disable onboard cus it will make me reset cmos again :p
2010-05-08T04:59:00.000Z	MikeChelen	Coppermine	what happens if you boot with the screen plugged into the pci card?
2010-05-08T05:00:00.000Z	Coppermine	MikeChelen	no signal on screen, then after 3 mins i switch to the onboard vga and im at gdm
