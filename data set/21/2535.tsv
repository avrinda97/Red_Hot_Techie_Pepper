2009-09-14T21:44:00.000Z	NakidGirl_With_I		<ManDay_> disable resume  on usb or upgrade kerenl
2009-09-14T21:44:00.000Z	ManDay	NakidGirl_With_I	is that a solution or just a guess?
2009-09-14T21:46:00.000Z	ManDay	NakidGirl_With_I	given that the problem must have been there since the existance of Hibernation and resume, it appears very unlikely that EXACTLY THE NEXT KERNEL is going to fix it, if you know what I mean... An update is hardly always the solution to a technical problem.
2009-09-14T21:46:00.000Z	ManDay	NakidGirl_With_I	plus, what do you mean "disable resume"?
2009-09-14T21:46:00.000Z	ManDay	NakidGirl_With_I	have you taken a look into the thread?
2009-09-14T21:48:00.000Z	ManDay	NakidGirl_With_I	what are you trying to tell me?
2009-09-14T21:48:00.000Z	ManDay	NakidGirl_With_I	it's close to, but it's not a very solution
2009-09-14T21:50:00.000Z	ManDay	NakidGirl_With_I	I don't see what exactly this last link you posted has to do with my problem
2009-09-14T21:52:00.000Z	ManDay	NakidGirl_With_I	my USB device resumes just fine, the problem is with the kernel. please read my thread
2009-09-14T21:55:00.000Z	ManDay	NakidGirl_With_I	in how far would you call this "the same"? It's totally different apart from the fact that it both has to do with USB suspension
2009-09-14T21:57:00.000Z	ManDay	NakidGirl_With_I	acpi=off didn't change anything.
2009-09-14T21:58:00.000Z	ManDay	NakidGirl_With_I	why would you assume that I'D have to reboot?
2009-09-14T22:00:00.000Z	ManDay	NakidGirl_With_I	with acpi=off Suspension-to-Ram has gone
2009-09-14T22:00:00.000Z	ManDay	NakidGirl_With_I	nothing works anymore.
2009-09-14T22:01:00.000Z	ManDay	NakidGirl_With_I	I'm sorry but you are not really adressing my actual problem.
2009-09-14T22:02:00.000Z	NakidGirl_With_I	ManDay	acpi-off has not to with mouse
