2006-05-25T15:36:00.000Z	gdb		Hey, guys, what's the state of SELinux on 5.10?  I'm digging for informatoin here on the Ubuntu wiki and I'm getting the impression that the work necessary to get it integrated isn't done yet but should be for a future release.  Is that true?
2006-05-25T15:38:00.000Z	gdb		Ah, ok, sounds good.
2006-05-25T15:38:00.000Z	gdb		I come from a Fedora background and I'm checking out Ubuntu because I like the philosophy behind it and the single CD installation.  I'm pretty lost when it comes to managing a Debian-like system, though, so it's all a learning experience for me.
2006-05-25T15:39:00.000Z	gdb		No problem, I see a lot of "port the management tools from Fedora" in the wiki page so I'm guessing there's a lot of integration work to be done yet.
2006-05-25T15:40:00.000Z	gdb		I don't care for Debian's library of CDs and I'm sort of tired of Fedora's development cycle so I'm looking for something I can be comfortable with.  So far, I'm liking Ubuntu and I'm looking forward to it getting up to speed on some of the newer techologies.  And I'm patient about it. :-)
2006-05-25T15:42:00.000Z	gdb		Yeah, I like how root is locked by default.
2006-05-25T15:42:00.000Z	gdb		So simply setting a password will cause the system to enforce its entry when booting single user mode.
2006-05-25T15:43:00.000Z	gdb		Thanks!
2006-05-25T15:43:00.000Z	gdb		Like I said, I'm new to the Debian-like (and thus Ubuntu) way of doing things coming from a Red Hat background (and before that Slackware and NetBSD).  It's a fun learning experience. :-)
2006-05-25T15:43:00.000Z	gdb		Have to find something new to do with it starts to get boring. ;-)
2006-05-25T15:43:00.000Z	ompaul	gdb	loose the root password and good bye, you are also vunerable to password attacks  on root
2006-05-25T15:44:00.000Z	gdb	ompaul	Ah, yes and no. :-)
2006-05-25T15:44:00.000Z	gdb	ompaul	I don't allow any incoming network save ssh and I use the AllowUsers directive in sshd_config so it's impossible to log into root from anywhere other than the console or via su so I'm not too concerned about it. :-)
2006-05-25T15:47:00.000Z	gdb	ompaul	Well, then you're no doubt aware that the risk incurred by setting a root password on an Ubuntu system is extremely small.
2006-05-25T15:47:00.000Z	ompaul	gdb	and so you walk away from the keyboard and leave an open terminal ;-)
2006-05-25T15:47:00.000Z	gdb	ompaul	I absolutely do when I'm at home.
2006-05-25T15:48:00.000Z	ompaul	gdb	Ng perhaps we should leave it there or take it to #ubuntu-offtopic
2007-05-21T13:41:00.000Z	ompaul	gdb	did you not hear the coin drop :-)
2007-05-21T13:41:00.000Z	gdb	ompaul	I'm afraid the reference is lost on me.  What did I miss?
2007-05-21T13:42:00.000Z	ompaul	gdb	orb.. said right right right my bad
2007-05-21T13:42:00.000Z	gdb	ompaul	Oh, sorry, I stare at what I'm typing when ... typing, and I did miss it.
