2007-08-17T16:48:00.000Z	christian		can't I just download mplayer the easily way from their pages, and the install? Which one of these? MPlayer v1.0rc1 source, MPlayer 1.0rc1, Windows MPlayer 1.0rc1, Windows GUI [MPlayer OS X 1.0rc1 Fedora Core RPM packages
2007-08-17T16:49:00.000Z	jrib	christian	the easy way is to enable multiverse and install it with your favorite package manager in ubuntu
2007-08-17T16:49:00.000Z	christian	jrib	ok, but what's ya mean about 'enable multiverse'?
2007-08-17T16:50:00.000Z	jrib	christian	system -> administration -> software sources
2007-08-17T16:55:00.000Z	jrib	christian	did you manage to enable multiverse?
2007-08-17T16:58:00.000Z	jrib	christian	?
2007-08-17T16:59:00.000Z	jrib	christian	the first tab of Software Sources has several checmarks.  One of them corresponds to Multiverse.  Do you see it?  mplayer is in multiverse, that's why you need it
2007-08-17T05:03:00.000Z	christian	jrib	i suggest is gonna be off, cause it was on.
2007-08-17T05:05:00.000Z	jrib	christian	it's supposed to be on
2007-08-17T05:05:00.000Z	christian	jrib	ok. and now?
2007-08-17T05:05:00.000Z	jrib	christian	now go to a terminal and type: sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude install mplayer   (this way we can be sure without using a gui)
2007-08-17T05:10:00.000Z	christian	jrib	is it finnish now? :pV
2007-08-17T05:11:00.000Z	jrib	christian	yes
2007-08-17T05:12:00.000Z	christian	jrib	the player looks just like it was before i installed it.. I don't even see the streaming.
2007-08-17T05:12:00.000Z	jrib	christian	you asked how to install mplayer.  What are you trying to do then?
2007-08-17T05:14:00.000Z	christian	jrib	I'm conna see this little clip
2007-08-17T05:15:00.000Z	jrib	christian	if you want to install the plugin for your browser, then you need to install "mozilla-mplayer", remove whatever your current plugin is (probably totem-mozilla), and restart your browser
2007-08-17T05:16:00.000Z	jrib	christian	and you may or may not need w32codecs as well
2007-08-17T05:16:00.000Z	christian	jrib	apt-get install mozilla-mplayer ?
2007-08-17T05:16:00.000Z	jrib	christian	yes, and remove totem-mozilla.  I have to go now, but that should do it.  If you still need help, Paddy_EIRE seems to understand the issue and is always helpful :)
2007-08-17T05:40:00.000Z	jrib	christian	Paddy_EIRE: did your video not work after installing mozilla-mplayer, removing totem-mozilla, and installing w32codecs?
