2010-06-20T04:19:00.000Z	Shapeshiftr		...anyone?
2010-06-20T04:19:00.000Z	Shapeshiftr		why would a reboot break my ip?
2010-06-20T04:19:00.000Z	Shapeshiftr		ifconfig still displays the same IP
2010-06-20T04:20:00.000Z	gogeta	Shapeshiftr	if behind a roughter as long as your lease doesent expire no your ip whont change
2010-06-20T04:21:00.000Z	Shapeshiftr	gogeta	then why else would my IP be able to be connected to before reboot, then after reboot, no ports are accessible?
2010-06-20T04:21:00.000Z	gogeta	Shapeshiftr	firewall maybe how do you fix it
2010-06-20T04:22:00.000Z	gogeta	Shapeshiftr	your connected now
2010-06-20T04:22:00.000Z	gogeta	Shapeshiftr	oh what you trying to acess
2010-06-20T04:23:00.000Z	gogeta	Shapeshiftr	you will need to open those port in ufw
2010-06-20T04:24:00.000Z	gogeta	Shapeshiftr	ubuntu has a firewall built in
2010-06-20T04:24:00.000Z	gogeta	Shapeshiftr	that was before ufw
2010-06-20T04:24:00.000Z	gogeta	Shapeshiftr	i would remove the one you installed
2010-06-20T04:25:00.000Z	gogeta	Shapeshiftr	that should fix the issue
2010-06-20T04:25:00.000Z	gogeta	Shapeshiftr	remove reboot should bring it all backup
2010-06-20T04:26:00.000Z	gogeta	Shapeshiftr	you still have ufw
2010-06-20T04:26:00.000Z	gogeta	Shapeshiftr	you had it firewalled twice
2010-06-20T04:27:00.000Z	gogeta	Shapeshiftr	ufw is auto enabled
2010-06-20T04:28:00.000Z	gogeta	Shapeshiftr	if you tryed to acess it from outside your local network it would refuse it
2010-06-20T04:31:00.000Z	gogeta	Shapeshiftr	ufw it pretty relaxes abought local ips but lets say if i tryed to ssh in from hear it would not allow it
2010-06-20T04:31:00.000Z	gogeta	Shapeshiftr	unless you whitelisted my ip
2010-06-20T04:32:00.000Z	gogeta	Shapeshiftr	it will allow it
