2012-03-05T02:59:00.000Z	elijah		My windows are doing something weird all the title panes are missing, is there a keyboard binding I pressed to disable them?
2012-03-05T03:00:00.000Z	elijah		I am on 11.10
2012-03-05T03:00:00.000Z	elijah		I don't have the restore, minimize close guttons
2012-03-05T03:00:00.000Z	elijah		*buttons
2012-03-05T03:02:00.000Z	zykotic10	elijah	are you using gnome2?  with compiz?
2012-03-05T03:03:00.000Z	zykotic10	elijah	sorry 11.10 - so no to gnome2 ;)
2012-03-05T04:35:00.000Z	zykotic10	elijah	you could check /var/log/Xorg.0.log or dmesg - to see if compiz is giving any hints why it's crashing
2012-03-05T04:36:00.000Z	elijah	zykotic10	I will try that, do you think I could somehow wipe out compiz and it's config files to get it back to normal?
2012-03-05T04:37:00.000Z	elijah	zykotic10	Or maybe install newer Nvidia drivers? I am running the "recommended" ones.
2012-03-05T04:37:00.000Z	zykotic10	elijah	i'm not sure on reseting compiz on ubuntu these days - it might be possible
2012-03-05T04:37:00.000Z	zykotic10	elijah	"recommended" is probably what you should be using
2012-03-05T04:38:00.000Z	elijah	zykotic10	thanks
2012-03-05T04:39:00.000Z	elijah	zykotic10	I also notice that when I want to resize a window the sensitivity area is extremely small, like the buffer area doesn't even exist, I have to got exactly on the right spot in order for the cursor to change in order for me to resize a window. Do you think this is related?
2012-03-05T04:40:00.000Z	zykotic10	elijah	not related, that resizing thing is a common complaint
2012-03-05T04:42:00.000Z	elijah	zykotic10	Good to know. K, I cat'ed the log and then coincidentally shortly after my system title bars went missing again and I cat'ed the log file again and nothing new was added
2012-03-05T04:42:00.000Z	zykotic10	elijah	sorry i'm not sure where compiz would log to?  good luck!
2012-03-05T04:43:00.000Z	elijah	zykotic10	I did see this new message in dmesg - though, "[  496.192870] gtk-window-deco[1540]: segfault at 100 ip 08056008 sp bf8b9c30 error 4 in gtk-window-decorator[8048000+1b000]
2012-03-05T04:43:00.000Z	zykotic10	elijah	that would probably be the error segfault, it's not very helpful however, you could try searching for some of those details to see if others have the same issue.
2012-03-05T04:44:00.000Z	elijah	zykotic10	Doing it now
2012-03-05T04:59:00.000Z	elijah	zykotic10	known issue, found workaround, I hope - https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/compiz/+bug/740767
2012-03-05T04:59:00.000Z	zykotic10	elijah	NICE!  good job
