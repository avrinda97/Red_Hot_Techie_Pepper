2011-10-16T14:39:00.000Z	alvin47		why does my ubuntu netbook 2d session always disappears as soon as i log in?
2011-10-16T14:40:00.000Z	dc5ala	alvin47	you automatically get back to login screen?
2011-10-16T14:42:00.000Z	alvin47	dc5ala	nope.. as desktop appears , the 2d interface disappears, and turns into normal gnome desktop
2011-10-16T14:43:00.000Z	dc5ala	alvin47	check your ~/.xession-errors for unity2d errors
2011-10-16T14:44:00.000Z	alvin47	dc5ala	from the log viewer? or wherelse?
2011-10-16T14:45:00.000Z	dc5ala	alvin47	you can also paste that file to a nopaste service, like paste.ubuntu.com, then link it here for others to have a look
2011-10-16T14:47:00.000Z	alvin47	dc5ala	where can i find the log?
2011-10-16T14:47:00.000Z	dc5ala	alvin47	in your home directory, it's a hidden file starting with a dot
2011-10-16T14:48:00.000Z	alvin47	dc5ala	ok thanks ,wait
2011-10-16T14:50:00.000Z	alvin47	dc5ala	here it is http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/709501/.. :)
2011-10-16T14:51:00.000Z	dc5ala	alvin47	okay, will have a look if can find a hint in there
2011-10-16T14:52:00.000Z	alvin47	dc5ala	ok thank you very much, i'm counting on that... :D
2011-10-16T14:55:00.000Z	dc5ala	alvin47	what sessions did you select on login screen?
2011-10-16T14:56:00.000Z	alvin47	dc5ala	ubuntu netbook edition 2D
2011-10-16T14:59:00.000Z	dc5ala	alvin47	okay, thought you meant unity2d when you said 2d, can you try to re-install "netbook-launcher-efl" package?
2011-10-16T15:01:00.000Z	alvin47	dc5ala	nah.. this is 10.04, i'm always logging in to ubuntu netbook edition 2D but later these hours, it's always disappearing after the panel appears
2011-10-16T15:06:00.000Z	alvin47	dc5ala	i already reinstalled netbook-launcher-efl via synaptic.. what's next? :D
2011-10-16T15:06:00.000Z	dc5ala	alvin47	i am sorry, don't know much about that netbook edition, only see the launcher complaining about a file and a theme (try change that) complaining too
2011-10-16T15:07:00.000Z	alvin47	dc5ala	ah see,, ok thanks anyway :D
2011-10-16T15:09:00.000Z	alvin47	dc5ala	i'll try relogging
2011-10-16T15:10:00.000Z	dc5ala	alvin47	good luck! :)
