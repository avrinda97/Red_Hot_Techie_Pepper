2010-06-09T01:38:00.000Z	Gryllida		Where is SSH client here? I can't find it in the menus
2010-06-09T01:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Gryllida	Open a terminal and "ssh user@host"
2010-06-09T01:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Gryllida	There are GUI ssh clients available, but there's not much point IMHO
2010-06-09T01:41:00.000Z	Gryllida	Jordan_U	how do I remove something from list of known hosts in ssh?
2010-06-09T01:41:00.000Z	Gryllida	Jordan_U	it had authencity problems, I added it though, now i want to remove
2010-06-09T01:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Gryllida	The list of known hosts is stored in ~/.ssh/known_hosts by default the host names are hashed for security, so it can be hard to tell which entry corrosponds to the server you want to remove
2010-06-09T01:46:00.000Z	Gryllida	Jordan_U	bah, how do I remove it anyways?
2010-06-09T01:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Gryllida	If you don't have any other server's credentials saved that you can't lose then just "rm ~/.ssh/known_hosts"
2010-06-09T01:48:00.000Z	Gryllida	Jordan_U	Thank you.
2010-06-09T01:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Gryllida	You're welcome.
2010-06-28T02:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Gryllida	If you want to use firefox from Mozilla's website (why?) then install it within your home directory.
2010-06-28T02:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Gryllida	DO NOT RUN FIREFOX AS ROOT, you have been warned many times. It's a terrible idea and there is no valid reason to do it.
2010-06-28T02:57:00.000Z	Gryllida	Jordan_U	sebsebseb: I'm using firefox nightly from mozilla website, of course I need to update it at least every week.
2010-06-28T02:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Gryllida	If you want to use firefox from Mozilla's website (why?) then install it within your home directory.
2010-06-28T02:58:00.000Z	Gryllida	Jordan_U	why - because I'm nightly tester; then install - done; but I don't want to download and install it in same way manually every time I want to update it.
2010-06-28T02:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Gryllida	Then install to your home directory.
2010-06-28T02:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Gryllida	Then firefox will havve permissions to update all of the files that it needs to update.
2010-06-28T02:59:00.000Z	Gryllida	Jordan_U	it's in usr/local/, and since I don't have any session saved, home page is an about: page, so no danger in running it as root
2010-06-28T03:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Gryllida	Don't put it in /usr/local, put it in your home directory.
2010-06-28T03:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Gryllida	That item works fine if you install to your home directory. You'll notice that packages from the repository don't have that menu item because you're supposed to use the package manager instead
2010-06-28T03:04:00.000Z	Gryllida	Jordan_U	the instructions say to install it to /usr/local .
