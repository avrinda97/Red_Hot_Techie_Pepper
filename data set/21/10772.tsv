2007-04-13T09:00:00.000Z	_nando_		good evening everyone
2007-04-13T09:01:00.000Z	_nando_		i need help to set up ssh... if someone can help please prv me
2007-04-13T09:03:00.000Z	_nando_		here it goes... how can i test if ssh port is open from my own computer? i do not have access to a remote shell
2007-04-13T09:03:00.000Z	_nando_		i believe the firewall settings are ok
2007-04-13T09:04:00.000Z	Xenguy	_nando_	lsof |grep -i listen
2007-04-13T09:04:00.000Z	Xenguy	_nando_	... should show the ports that are 'LISTENING'
2007-04-13T09:05:00.000Z	Xenguy	_nando_	er, sudo that
2007-04-13T09:10:00.000Z	Xenguy	_nando_	openssh is best
2007-04-13T09:10:00.000Z	Xenguy	_nando_	what Flannel said
2007-04-13T09:13:00.000Z	Xenguy	_nando_	actually not sure, I'd have to read the man page - dunno if it's all that important tho in most cases
2007-04-13T09:20:00.000Z	Xenguy	_nando_	here's a test you could try...
2007-04-13T09:21:00.000Z	Xenguy	_nando_	change the 'port' you are using in /etc/ssh/sshd_config to, say, 2345; then re-start the ssh server (/etc/init.d/ssh restart); then try ssh'ing from work into your home box via port 2345
2007-04-13T09:22:00.000Z	Xenguy	_nando_	the point is to test if your work firewall is blocking outgoing port 22 (as someone mentioned earlier)
2007-04-13T09:23:00.000Z	Xenguy	_nando_	if you are talking to me, prepend my nick; I am on many channels
2007-04-13T09:27:00.000Z	Xenguy	_nando_	shields up  ?

2007-04-13T09:29:00.000Z	Xenguy	_nando_	try testing port 22 (or whatever port you have ssh configured for) and see what happens
2007-04-13T09:30:00.000Z	Xenguy	_nando_	I can tell you right now that your SSH server is listening on port 22 :-)
2007-04-13T09:31:00.000Z	Xenguy	_nando_	yes
2007-04-13T09:32:00.000Z	Xenguy	_nando_	so your work is probably blocking port 22 outgoing, which is usually easy to work around with another port
2007-04-13T09:32:00.000Z	Xenguy	_nando_	yw
