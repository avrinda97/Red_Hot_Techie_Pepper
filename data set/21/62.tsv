2012-10-22T01:35:00.000Z	Cosmin		Hello there, I'm sorry to bother, I'm new here, I have a question regarding Ubuntu 12.10
2012-10-22T01:36:00.000Z	Cosmin		Hello there, I'm sorry to bother, I'm new here, I have a question regarding Ubuntu 12.10, sorry to repeat myself
2012-10-22T01:37:00.000Z	Cosmin		regarding the well known error "Adding read ACL uid 1000", I've searched the internet, but nothing could have helped me
2012-10-22T01:38:00.000Z	Cosmin		what do you mean? what i did to reach this point
2012-10-22T01:38:00.000Z	Cosmin		?
2012-10-22T01:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cosmin	your first user is UID 1000
2012-10-22T01:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cosmin	the username you use is just a pretty mask for that number
2012-10-22T01:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cosmin	doesn't the CD contain windows drivers only?
2012-10-22T01:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cosmin	what wifi chip are you using?
2012-10-22T01:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cosmin	run:  sudo lshw -C network    there will be a product line which tells you the chip
2012-10-22T01:51:00.000Z	Cosmin	ActionParsnip	I'm back, I have the same problem with all my CD's plus my USB
2012-10-22T01:54:00.000Z	Cosmin	ActionParsnip	I think the most easiest way to fix this is to install the 12.04 version of Ubuntu? even if I don't want, I want to struggle a little bit with this
2012-10-22T01:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cosmin	could go for a clean install of 12.10 first
2012-11-25T00:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cosmin	install build-essential to get a compiling environment :)
2012-11-25T00:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cosmin	which file?
2012-11-25T00:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cosmin	you don't have to put it anywhere special, you can compile in terminal
2012-11-25T00:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cosmin	desktop is fine
2012-11-25T00:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cosmin	you will need to run:    cd ~/Desktop    first
2012-11-25T00:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cosmin	or the interpretter won't find the file
2012-11-25T00:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cosmin	read above
2012-11-25T00:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cosmin	I'd ask in #c++
