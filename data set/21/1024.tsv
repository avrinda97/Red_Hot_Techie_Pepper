2011-03-29T09:05:00.000Z	jiltdil		i have a partition named Data and i want to mount it automatically on every system restart how to do that using fstab?
2011-03-29T09:05:00.000Z	ac7ss	jiltdil	add an entry to your /etc/fstab
2011-03-29T09:06:00.000Z	jiltdil		ac7ss:whats the entery i have to de done
2011-03-29T09:06:00.000Z	ac7ss	jiltdil	use a mount command to mount it where you want it, use the information gained from 'mount' to copy into the fstab.
2011-03-29T09:08:00.000Z	ac7ss	jiltdil	"mount /dev/hdb0 /data ; mount" the result will give something like /dev/dhb0 on /data type vfat options rw, nouser,remount
2011-03-29T09:10:00.000Z	ac7ss	jiltdil	use that information line from the mount command to set the options in fstab, copying the options shown.
