2008-03-09T09:47:00.000Z	Cann0n		yo, how do i kill the annoying system passwords every time i change something? thats new to me
2008-03-09T09:48:00.000Z	Flannel	Cann0n	you dont want to.  You won't be changing things like that much after an initial period.  And its much safer
2008-03-09T09:48:00.000Z	Cann0n	Flannel	i do want to. slackware isnt like that...
2008-03-09T09:49:00.000Z	Flannel	Cann0n	Ubuntu doesn't use the root account
2008-03-09T09:50:00.000Z	Cann0n	Flannel	i know, its not enabled. i could, but i'd rather be able to use net tools with out "sudo" **
2008-03-09T09:53:00.000Z	Flannel	Cann0n	you cant.  You'll just be able to hide the password prompt, they'll still need to be run with elevated privledges.  Unless I am misunderstanding what you're looking for
2008-03-09T09:54:00.000Z	Cann0n	Flannel	i guess its the gnome gui im not used to or something... time to get fluxbuntu
2008-03-09T09:56:00.000Z	Flannel	Cann0n	That's doable.  But it'll still run with elevated privledges
2008-03-09T09:58:00.000Z	Cann0n	Flannel	i just dont want to type a password every time i run sometime. plus Wireshark i have to run in sudo otherwise my network devices wont show up. thats a problem with my ndiswrapper privileges
2008-03-09T09:58:00.000Z	Flannel	Cann0n	thats correct.  You just need to suid like nickrud suggested.
2008-11-22T15:20:00.000Z	Flannel	Cann0n	use bum
2008-11-22T15:09:00.000Z	Flannel	Cann0n	what else are you going to put on the partition?
2008-11-22T15:11:00.000Z	Cann0n	Flannel	i was thinking of a better distro
2008-11-22T15:11:00.000Z	Flannel	Cann0n	then you'd just go through the installation of whatever else, and it'll take care of it.
2008-11-22T15:13:00.000Z	Flannel	Cann0n	A tty? or you want like gnome-terminal?
2008-11-22T15:14:00.000Z	Flannel	Cann0n	ctrl-alt-f1 through ctrl-alt-f6, ctrl-alt-f7 gets you back to X
2008-11-22T15:18:00.000Z	Flannel	Cann0n	debian based systems don't have different runlevels (well, except the special ones), they're all identical by default.  You could change that, of course.
2008-11-22T15:19:00.000Z	Cann0n	Flannel	i mean for ubumtu
2008-11-22T15:19:00.000Z	Flannel	Cann0n	the above statement applies to Ubuntu as well, as it's debian based.
2008-11-22T15:30:00.000Z	Flannel	Cann0n	Please don't
2008-11-22T15:48:00.000Z	Flannel	Cann0n	please don't repeat your question so frequently.  20-30 minutes is a good timeframe
