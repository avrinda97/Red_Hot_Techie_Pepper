2009-11-21T04:41:00.000Z	mcurran		put nothing as the password and save
2009-11-21T04:42:00.000Z	mcurran		Oh, Unislash:  The WEP or password is wrong then
2009-11-21T04:42:00.000Z	mcurran		Also try to select open system, or try the other one
2009-11-21T04:42:00.000Z	Unislash	mcurran	well it certainly isn't the password, and it gives me no choice other than that
2009-11-21T04:44:00.000Z	mcurran	Unislash	 I thought you meant it asks you for the keyring password, that's why I said put in nothing.  It sounds like either the password you're trying is wrong or your selecting the wrong encryption type
2009-11-21T04:44:00.000Z	Unislash	mcurran	ah, nope, not the keyring; i could be selecting the wrong encryption type, but both wicd *and* the default connection manager gives me no other choice but WPA and WPA2 personal
2009-11-21T04:46:00.000Z	Unislash	mcurran	i'll try that out here... (i wonder if it'll let me keep my wired connection without interruption)
2009-11-21T04:47:00.000Z	Unislash	mcurran	nm-applet is a network manager application, correct? it's not showing up in synaptic
2009-11-21T05:16:00.000Z	Unislash	mcurran	turns out i've been using nm-applet (it's the default network manager)
2009-11-21T05:16:00.000Z	Unislash	mcurran	it does indeed let me make new profiles with specific security preferences, but when i try to connect using them it just makes a new profile and deems it a WPA & WPA2 personal security)
2009-11-21T05:19:00.000Z	mcurran	Unislash	 My guess would be that someone setup a WPA encryption key then and it's being detected.  You'll need to find out what the key is.
2009-11-21T05:20:00.000Z	Unislash	mcurran	but i know what the key is... :P
2009-11-21T05:20:00.000Z	Unislash	mcurran	windows xp, windows 7... all my roommates... it it the correct key
2009-11-21T05:21:00.000Z	Unislash	mcurran	hehe, yea, i've had that one time... unfortunately, there is no O's or 0's to get confused with... aepiuwesponda--pretty hard to mess up 20 times
2009-11-21T05:22:00.000Z	mcurran	Unislash	is there a tab on the bottom that lets you select open system or shared key?  Try the other...
2009-11-21T05:23:00.000Z	Unislash	mcurran	a tab on the bottom.... hmmm
2009-11-21T05:23:00.000Z	mcurran	Unislash	yeah the same window where you put in the key
2009-11-21T05:24:00.000Z	Unislash	mcurran	i'm using a... boy, i don't remember the chipset on my main box, but on the other one i do indeed have a pretty old chipset; i'm using b43legacy drivers
2009-11-21T05:26:00.000Z	Unislash	mcurran	but the card on my main box (the one i'm testing this all on) is only a year old, so it should (well, hopefully) have a good chipset--it worked in ubuntu right out of the box on other networks
2009-11-21T05:28:00.000Z	Unislash	mcurran	i'm not seeing that system/shared key box in this security type. if i go to wep i see it, but it won't let me use wep
2009-11-21T05:28:00.000Z	mcurran	Unislash	 Well I think I'm out of guesses for you.  Sorry.
