2007-12-17T03:55:00.000Z	ikonia	poOrBOon	no
2007-12-17T03:56:00.000Z	ikonia	poOrBOon	are you using ubuntu 7.10
2007-12-17T03:56:00.000Z	ikonia	poOrBOon	it's already installed by default
2007-12-17T03:56:00.000Z	ikonia	poOrBOon	use system --> administation --> advanced desktop effects
2007-12-17T03:57:00.000Z	ikonia	poOrBOon	thats a different matter
2007-12-17T03:57:00.000Z	ikonia	poOrBOon	but be aware that xgl/compiz is already installed
2007-12-17T03:57:00.000Z	ikonia	poOrBOon	have you used the restricted drivers manager ?
2007-12-17T03:57:00.000Z	ikonia	poOrBOon	and what is the situation using them
2007-12-17T03:57:00.000Z	poOrBOon	ikonia	XGL -> Not installed Compiz -> Installled
2007-12-17T03:58:00.000Z	ikonia	poOrBOon	where does it say that
2007-12-17T04:00:00.000Z	poOrBOon	ikonia	when I open Erscheinungsbild System -> appearance -> visual effects -> select extra or normal it says compiz could not get enabled
2007-12-17T04:01:00.000Z	ikonia	poOrBOon	ok, you're going to need someone who knows the ati drivers better than me. Have you looked in the xorg logs to check for anything obvious ?
2007-12-17T04:06:00.000Z	poOrBOon	ikonia	there is nothing special
2007-12-17T04:15:00.000Z	ikonia	poOrBOon	don't use grub2
2007-12-17T04:16:00.000Z	poOrBOon	ikonia	why?
2007-12-17T04:17:00.000Z	ikonia	poOrBOon	grub2 is not stable
2007-12-17T04:19:00.000Z	poOrBOon	ikonia	how about runit,runit-run,runit-services and socklog ? Is it better than the ones delivered by ubuntu?
2007-12-17T04:19:00.000Z	ikonia	poOrBOon	I don't think so, I think they are personally weak, but thats only a personal opinion
2007-12-17T04:20:00.000Z	poOrBOon	ikonia	u saved a computers life today, your his/her/it's hero!
