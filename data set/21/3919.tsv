2008-10-19T18:04:00.000Z	geronimaldo		danopia; could do but I´m trying not to reinvent te wheel
2008-10-19T18:04:00.000Z	danopia_	geronimaldo	I'm sure there are PHP apps out there you can grab.
2008-10-19T18:04:00.000Z	geronimaldo		yah something I can connect to and update remotely
2008-10-19T18:05:00.000Z	geronimaldo		yah I´ll check it ut. . maybe buld it in mysql with a php front end
2008-10-19T18:06:00.000Z	danopia_	geronimaldo	I'm acutally owrking on a PHP-based calendar, but way more complex, its for my teachers to enter homework and for students to have their own list of homework etc.
2008-10-19T18:08:00.000Z	geronimaldo		oh yah that sounds interesting. and will they be able to access this from home?
2008-10-19T18:10:00.000Z	danopia_	geronimaldo	yes.
2008-10-19T18:11:00.000Z	danopia_	geronimaldo	I'll verify everyone before they get access to everything (verify in person) so my school dones't get mad at me, then students select tehir classes and the entries for that period (entered by teacher) get filled into to the student's calendar.
2008-10-19T18:14:00.000Z	geronimaldo	danopia	will they let you host it on the school´s website?
2008-10-19T18:15:00.000Z	danopia_	geronimaldo	of course not!!!!!!! I will refuse if they want to hsot it.
2008-10-19T18:15:00.000Z	danopia_	geronimaldo	I have a couple dedicated boxes and a domain.
2008-10-19T18:15:00.000Z	danopia_	geronimaldo	they web server is down more often than nouptime.com
2008-10-19T18:18:00.000Z	geronimaldo	danopia	all the best man. it sounds a decenpt project
2008-10-19T18:18:00.000Z	geronimaldo		just hope the school gets on board.
2008-10-19T18:23:00.000Z	danopia_	geronimaldo	they don't need to, jsut some teachers need to type in assignments, and I can do taht.
2008-10-19T18:23:00.000Z	danopia_	geronimaldo	I could just type in the proejcts for my scheduale and get some friends to do that too.
