2008-01-17T08:03:00.000Z	bod_	bruenig	ccsm is a correct command ,.,. the output was ubuntu's bad file path not mine
2008-02-02T20:46:00.000Z	bruenig	bod_	your link isn't clickable :(
2008-02-02T20:46:00.000Z	bod_	bruenig	:http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/54485/
2008-02-02T20:46:00.000Z	bruenig	bod_	you only need sudo for the last command by the way
2008-02-02T20:47:00.000Z	bod_	bruenig	really?
2008-02-02T20:47:00.000Z	bruenig	bod_	yes, the rest can be done as regular user
2008-02-02T20:47:00.000Z	bod_	bruenig	what about the rm commands?
2008-02-02T20:47:00.000Z	bruenig	bod_	what is -a in cp supposed to do?
2008-02-02T20:48:00.000Z	bod_	bruenig	i was told to add those ,.,. they said something about recursive and hidden files
2008-02-02T20:49:00.000Z	bruenig	bod_	ok, -r makes since, I haven't seen -a ever to be honest with you, but why are you tarring it exactly?
2008-02-02T20:50:00.000Z	bod_	bruenig	im making a script to ease making GDM screens,. they need to be tar'd in a certain folder,.
2008-02-02T20:51:00.000Z	bruenig	bod_	ok well the obvious problem is that you can't have permissions to do the tar command
2008-02-02T20:51:00.000Z	bod_	bruenig	sudo the tar command?
2008-02-02T20:51:00.000Z	bruenig	bod_	that tar command is creating a tarball in an area only owned by root
2008-02-02T20:52:00.000Z	bruenig	bod_	yes if that is what you need, I am not exactly sure how gdm does themes so there could be a conceptual problem with the script on top of that
2008-02-02T20:52:00.000Z	bruenig	bod_	furthermore when you sudo the tar command, the last command will be unnecessary
2008-02-02T20:53:00.000Z	bod_	bruenig	i no how to do it threw the gui but i want to cut down the time it takes to do that,.,. ok,.,. and true bout the last 1 ty,.,. il post my finished model for you to have a look at ,.,. cheers
2008-02-02T20:54:00.000Z	bruenig	bod_	yeah I don't use gdm at all which is why I can't see if what you are doing is right or not is what I mean
2008-02-02T20:54:00.000Z	bod_	bruenig	ok,.,. just out of interest,. what do you use?
2008-02-02T20:54:00.000Z	bruenig	bod_	I don't use any, I just have init log me in automatically
2008-02-02T20:55:00.000Z	bod_	bruenig	ah,.,. cool,. but the youll be able to tell if it looks ok,.,. cheers m8
