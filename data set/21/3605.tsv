2008-11-15T10:19:00.000Z	Sinani201		Fryguy, was that supposed to fix it?
2008-11-15T10:19:00.000Z	Sinani201		In the Terminal?
2008-11-15T10:20:00.000Z	Sinani201		oh
2008-11-15T10:21:00.000Z	Sinani201		The Terminal says: direct rendering: No (If you want to find out why, try setting LIBGL_DEBUG=verbose)
2008-11-15T10:21:00.000Z	Sinani201		OpenGL renderer string: Mesa GLX Indirect
2008-11-15T10:21:00.000Z	Peddy	Sinani201	I just joined, but are you having a direct rendering problem? I had one, and I fixed it. It came after some recent updates, correct?
2008-11-15T10:22:00.000Z	Sinani201	Peddy	I don't think I have a rendering problem; it's just that the game is lagging like crazy
2008-11-15T10:22:00.000Z	Peddy	Sinani201	Does Direct Rendering say 'no'?
2008-11-15T10:22:00.000Z	Sinani201	Peddy	It says no.
2008-11-15T10:23:00.000Z	Peddy	Sinani201	Try chmod 666 /dev/nvidia* as root
2008-11-15T10:23:00.000Z	Peddy	Sinani201	That fixed it for me.
2008-11-15T10:23:00.000Z	Peddy	Sinani201	My games were lagging heaps as well, the FPS was jumping alot.
2008-11-15T10:24:00.000Z	Sinani201	Peddy	Was I supposed to put that in the Terminal? IT didn't work
2008-11-15T10:24:00.000Z	Peddy	Sinani201	In the terminal, and put a 'sudo' before it.
2008-11-15T10:25:00.000Z	Sinani201	Peddy	It still doesn't work :(
2008-11-15T10:25:00.000Z	Peddy	Sinani201	Do glxinfo | grep -i direct
2008-11-15T10:26:00.000Z	Sinani201	Peddy	I already did that; it says no
