2011-06-10T19:16:00.000Z	Guest11444		I can't get my machine to suspend or hibernate (fresh install of natty). I've been looking at launchpad bug-reports and the forums.
2011-06-10T19:16:00.000Z	Guest11444		A lot of users are having the same issue, but no solutions yet
2011-06-10T19:17:00.000Z	pfifo	Guest11444	is your swap at least the size of your ram
2011-06-10T19:18:00.000Z	Guest11444	pfifo	to be exact: my swap is 9gb and i have 4gb of ram
2011-06-10T19:36:00.000Z	Guest11444	pfifo	how do i check the changes to the kernel though? and what can i do about it?
2011-06-10T19:30:00.000Z	pfifo	Guest11444	Viliny if i had the hardware i could troubleshoot it, but I dont :(
2011-06-10T19:31:00.000Z	pfifo	Guest11444	yeah but Id loose it on suspend lol
2011-06-10T19:33:00.000Z	pfifo	Guest11444	i would start be figuring out what has changed in the kernel
2011-06-10T19:35:00.000Z	Guest11444	pfifo	 that's the thing. I can get suspend and hibernate functionality back by using a rather old kernel (2.6.35) but then the touchpad doesn't work the way it should
2011-06-10T19:37:00.000Z	pfifo	Guest11444	first check the version numbers, and read the change logs for anything acpi related, thencheck the new kernel to see what the configuration is like.
2011-06-10T19:38:00.000Z	Guest11444	pfifo	 but that's like...30 changelogs!
2011-06-10T19:39:00.000Z	pfifo	Guest11444	debugging is not easy
2011-06-10T19:39:00.000Z	Guest11444	pfifo	;_;
2011-06-10T19:39:00.000Z	pfifo	Guest11444	but just think of all the glory! youd be a launchpad hero
2011-06-10T19:43:00.000Z	pfifo	Guest11444	maybe we will luck out and my mom's new laptop will suffer from that problem
2011-06-10T19:43:00.000Z	Guest11444	pfifo	 get her a dell!
2011-06-10T19:44:00.000Z	Guest11444	pfifo	 I think your mom would love a dell studio 1747
2011-06-10T19:44:00.000Z	Guest11444	pfifo	 that core i7 processor is just what she needs
2011-06-10T19:44:00.000Z	pfifo	Guest11444	no this is a acer, older model on clearance
2011-06-10T19:45:00.000Z	pfifo	Guest11444	but your right my mom would love that dell lappy, so long as it has a numberpad
2011-06-10T19:46:00.000Z	Guest11444	pfifo	it does, and a 17 inch monitor
