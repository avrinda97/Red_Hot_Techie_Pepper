2012-07-28T12:42:00.000Z	Snowie	Grimhound	hello :)
2012-07-28T12:45:00.000Z	Snowie	Grimhound	there is a terminal app that might help, try $ alsamixer
2012-07-28T12:58:00.000Z	Snowie	Grimhound	ok. it's command line based, so i assume you have a terminal with 'alsamixer' running?
2012-07-28T12:58:00.000Z	Snowie	Grimhound	do you see other out's for audio?
2012-07-28T12:59:00.000Z	Snowie	Grimhound	ok, sec, let me open mine
2012-07-28T13:00:00.000Z	Snowie	Grimhound	you should be able to push left/right and choose all the outputs
2012-07-28T13:00:00.000Z	Grimhound	Snowie	And how do I switch them around?
2012-07-28T13:01:00.000Z	Grimhound	Snowie	My goal is to change the main speaker out from "default" to "not-default"
2012-07-28T13:01:00.000Z	Snowie	Grimhound	so you are looking to make a different jack the default. hit f6 and see what you get. does that help you?
2012-07-28T13:02:00.000Z	Grimhound	Snowie	0 CA0106, 1 HDA Intel, 2 HD-Audio Generic
2012-07-28T13:04:00.000Z	Snowie	Grimhound	so the motherboard card has how may audio outs?
2012-07-28T13:04:00.000Z	Grimhound	Snowie	Selected HDI Intel. Seems to be the right one.
2012-07-28T13:04:00.000Z	Grimhound	Snowie	Should be 6
2012-07-28T13:04:00.000Z	Snowie	Grimhound	yeah, it will be, but having a look, i don't think i have you in the right place
2012-07-28T13:09:00.000Z	Snowie	Grimhound	apoligies and out of your way man. I assumed the options were in alsamixer, i was wrong. sorry man
2012-07-28T13:16:00.000Z	Snowie	Grimhound	jsut prt scr
2012-07-28T13:20:00.000Z	Snowie	Grimhound	the worst thing is, the liveCD/DVD will often work flawlessly, and then fail to even start in my experience. they are not the same thing for these "niggling" issues
2012-07-28T13:23:00.000Z	Snowie	Grimhound	i havnt been able to find an article to achieve changing a single physical output to be the default rather than another.
2012-07-28T13:24:00.000Z	Snowie	Grimhound	+1 to terminhell
2012-07-28T13:25:00.000Z	Snowie	Grimhound	does ur pc and monitor have hdmi in/out?
