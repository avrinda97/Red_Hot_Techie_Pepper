2007-10-25T05:03:00.000Z	AnAlien8me	astro76	so whats my problem?
2007-10-25T05:04:00.000Z	astro76	AnAlien8me	I'm not sure what the question is besides your fdisk output
2007-10-25T05:04:00.000Z	astro76	AnAlien8me	then you get a password prompt?
2007-10-25T05:05:00.000Z	AnAlien8me	astro76	yeah i type the password, and i know its right.
2007-10-25T05:05:00.000Z	astro76	AnAlien8me	type which password?
2007-10-25T05:05:00.000Z	AnAlien8me	astro76	the one for my vista drive

2007-10-25T05:06:00.000Z	AnAlien8me	astro76	being honest, all the passwords on my pc are the same anyway
2007-10-25T05:07:00.000Z	astro76	AnAlien8me	what do you mean password for your vista drive? your password in windows?
2007-10-25T05:07:00.000Z	astro76	AnAlien8me	I'm not sure why it would ever ask you for a password
2007-10-25T05:08:00.000Z	AnAlien8me	astro76	well it always used to, and i typed it, and it worked
2007-10-25T05:11:00.000Z	AnAlien8me	astro76	so any ideas? its a few hundred gigs of important info i cant get access too :'(
2007-10-25T05:12:00.000Z	astro76	AnAlien8me	no sorry, I don't know why it asks you for a password in the first place
2007-10-25T05:31:00.000Z	astro76	AnAlien8me	it needs it, it just uses it by default in gutsy
