2008-06-09T20:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eviltim	It isnt a problem with ubuntu.. it is a problem with the download or the way it was burned or the burn process itself
2008-06-09T20:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eviltim	what is the md5 of the iso yo have there
2008-06-09T20:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eviltim	what is the md5 of the iso yo have there and how are you burning the cd? as file or iso image
2008-06-09T20:42:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eviltim	is there an iso in that zip
2008-06-09T20:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eviltim	isorecorder is an easy way to burn iso images to a cd
2008-06-09T20:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eviltim	No, ubuntu is not realeased by US as a zip
2008-06-09T20:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eviltim	download isorecorder... free windows software and try right clicking the rar you have of ubuntu and writing to disk

2008-06-09T20:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eviltim	isorecorder is as simple as right clicking the iso
2008-06-09T20:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eviltim	the same as we do in linux.. go figure
