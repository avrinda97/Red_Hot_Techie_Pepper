2008-07-24T19:28:00.000Z	TuxPWNZ		My system eventually stops playing any sound. How can I fix that?
2008-07-24T19:29:00.000Z	bazhang	TuxPWNZ	that is far too little info
2008-07-24T19:30:00.000Z	TuxPWNZ	bazhang	Can you tell me what else do you need?
2008-07-24T19:31:00.000Z	bazhang	TuxPWNZ	what are you using? alsa? check alsamixer in terminal? playing flash and music player at same time? need that kind of info. just saying it doesnt work will not get much of an answer
2008-07-24T19:33:00.000Z	TuxPWNZ	bazhang	Yes, for example Amarok, and exaile refuse to play any music. And yeah, I'm usually playing some flash and a music player when this happens.
2008-07-24T19:33:00.000Z	bazhang	TuxPWNZ	that would be it then
2008-07-24T19:33:00.000Z	TuxPWNZ	bazhang	And the only way I could them to work again is be rebooting the system.
2008-07-24T19:34:00.000Z	TuxPWNZ	bazhang	Is there a way to fix this without having to reboot??
2008-07-24T19:36:00.000Z	TuxPWNZ	bazhang	Is there any way to fix this without having to reboot??
2008-07-24T19:37:00.000Z	bazhang	TuxPWNZ	many folks have that issue; have you tried setting to alsa from autodetect?
2008-07-24T19:37:00.000Z	TuxPWNZ	bazhang	How's that done?
2008-07-24T19:37:00.000Z	bazhang	TuxPWNZ	in system prefs sound
2008-07-24T19:39:00.000Z	TuxPWNZ	bazhang	Okay, done it, and it worked! :D
2008-07-24T19:40:00.000Z	TuxPWNZ	bazhang	Now, one more thing, Amarok refusing to start.
2008-07-24T19:41:00.000Z	bazhang	TuxPWNZ	try from terminal and pastebin any errors to paste.ubuntu.com (NOT here)
2008-07-24T19:43:00.000Z	TuxPWNZ	bazhang	Okay, from the terminal, Amarok still doesn't start, and no errors appeared to too. However the terminal is still busy executing my command.
2008-07-24T19:43:00.000Z	bazhang	TuxPWNZ	open terminal and type top and see if it is still running
2008-07-24T19:44:00.000Z	TuxPWNZ	bazhang	Yes, it's there.
2008-07-24T19:44:00.000Z	bazhang	TuxPWNZ	did you minimize to tray instead of quitting?
2008-07-24T19:45:00.000Z	TuxPWNZ	bazhang	No, I closed it completely.
2008-07-24T19:46:00.000Z	TuxPWNZ	bazhang	Not even killall works
