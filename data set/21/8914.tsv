2006-10-15T13:10:00.000Z	fredl		does anybody know how come the Ubuntu I'm running in my VMWare server automatically logs in the user 'ubuntu' ?
2006-10-15T13:10:00.000Z	fredl		hey since there's some edgy users here, anybody know if Enlightenment DR17 is already in there?
2006-10-15T13:11:00.000Z	fredl		is there a way to make Ubuntu automatically log in a user without providing a password?!?!
2006-10-15T13:12:00.000Z	fredl		it's in Dapper?? no way.
2006-10-15T13:13:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	fredl	check login window, under system. look under security
2006-10-15T13:13:00.000Z	fredl	nolimitsoya	thanks.
2007-01-01T15:43:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	fredl	whats the purpouse of this project?
2007-01-01T15:44:00.000Z	fredl	nolimitsoya	the purpose is described on http://wiki.3dn.nl/index.php/GLUE
2007-01-01T15:44:00.000Z	fredl	nolimitsoya	the description is fairly terse however.
2007-01-01T15:48:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	fredl	im not sure... what would be diffrent from, say, launchpad?
2007-01-01T15:48:00.000Z	fredl	nolimitsoya	well it's not a bugtracking system OR a version control system itself.....
2007-01-01T15:49:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	fredl	right... so its just a web interface?
2007-01-01T15:49:00.000Z	fredl	nolimitsoya	it's supposed to be an application that keeps track of software modules, in which version control system they're kept, which bugtracking system is used for it etc.
2007-01-01T15:50:00.000Z	fredl	nolimitsoya	nope, not quite. When the database is populated, GLUE should be able to use all this information to generate 'releases' coming from different repositories/bugtracking systems.
2007-01-01T15:52:00.000Z	fredl	nolimitsoya	additionally, GLUE should be able to generate (automatically) things like RPM's, DEB's etc. depending on the component's settings.
2007-01-01T15:54:00.000Z	fredl	nolimitsoya	am I making any sense? :-)
2007-01-01T15:54:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	fredl	some. :) a more stringent description on the website, and a link to a faq, would probably be helpfull in generating more intrest :)
2007-01-01T15:55:00.000Z	fredl	nolimitsoya	hey I built what I have in 4 days and I'm just cranking away at coding, I have no time to document stuff yet!
2007-01-01T15:56:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	fredl	but without it, you wont have much luck recruiting, and thats what you wanted, wasnt it?
2007-01-01T15:56:00.000Z	fredl	nolimitsoya	just imagine... 'glue build UBUNTU.ubuntu.org'
2007-01-01T15:58:00.000Z	fredl	nolimitsoya	but you're right.... I'll document the purpose more clearly and come back and ask more :)
