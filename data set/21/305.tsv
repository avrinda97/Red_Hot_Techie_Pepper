2012-06-26T04:12:00.000Z	Nicekiwi		help, theres a proccess that refuses to be killed!
2012-06-26T04:13:00.000Z	Nicekiwi		a program has hung and i cant kill it
2012-06-26T04:13:00.000Z	i7c	Nicekiwi	try kill -9 <PID>
2012-06-26T04:14:00.000Z	Nicekiwi	i7c	dosnt work, says the PID dosnt exist
2012-06-26T04:14:00.000Z	Nicekiwi	i7c	nope, dosnt work
2012-06-26T04:14:00.000Z	i7c	Nicekiwi	find out about the pid with    ps -fA | grep -i "PROCESSNAME"
2012-06-26T04:15:00.000Z	i7c	Nicekiwi	second column should be PID
2012-06-26T04:15:00.000Z	Nicekiwi	i7c	yeah but it claims that ID dosnt exist
2012-06-26T04:16:00.000Z	i7c	Nicekiwi	try killall <processname>
2012-06-26T04:16:00.000Z	Nicekiwi	i7c	the proccess dosnt have a name either
2012-06-26T04:17:00.000Z	i7c	Nicekiwi	o.O
2012-06-26T04:17:00.000Z	Nicekiwi	i7c	the username on it is 'root, -1'
2012-06-26T04:18:00.000Z	i7c	Nicekiwi	nothing unusual that a process runs as root. -1 seems to be a nice-value (process priority)
2012-06-26T04:19:00.000Z	Nicekiwi	i7c	ive tried killing it and force killing it. nothing..
2012-06-26T04:19:00.000Z	i7c	Nicekiwi	why do you even wanna kill it? can you see the process in htop or top? don't kill random system processes ;)
2012-06-26T04:19:00.000Z	Nicekiwi	i7c	thwe windows is still there, CPU% is unkown,
2012-06-26T04:20:00.000Z	Nicekiwi	i7c	its a game that crashed
2012-06-26T04:20:00.000Z	i7c	Nicekiwi	oh i see. what desktop are you using?
2012-06-26T04:24:00.000Z	Nicekiwi	i7c	uhm.. ubuntu, in the KDE DM
2012-06-26T04:28:00.000Z	Nicekiwi	i7c	guess i'll jus logout/in again.. :(
2012-06-26T04:29:00.000Z	i7c	Nicekiwi	that could be the easiest solution
