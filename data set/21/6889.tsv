2007-02-18T09:07:00.000Z	dromer		hi, I'm trying to change tho boot-sequence for my ancient toshiba laptop, but I'm not getting into the bios, anyone know how I could? (it's definatly not del)
2007-02-18T09:07:00.000Z	jussi01	dromer	f1 or f12?
2007-02-18T09:08:00.000Z	dromer	jussi01	not F1
2007-02-18T09:08:00.000Z	dromer	jussi01	not F12 either :/
2007-02-18T09:09:00.000Z	jussi01	dromer	weird, does it not tell you on the initial screen?
2007-02-18T09:09:00.000Z	dromer	jussi01	no, it just says Toshiba and does a ram-check
2007-02-18T09:10:00.000Z	dromer	jussi01	and it tries to read tho floppy-drive first, but nothing happens (I have a bootfloppy already in it)
2007-02-18T09:18:00.000Z	jussi01	dromer	have fun... I gotta run though...
2007-02-18T09:11:00.000Z	jussi01	dromer	thats weird, have you looked on toshiba's website?
2007-02-18T09:12:00.000Z	dromer	jussi01	not yet, but I'm afraid there is no support for this machine yet :P)
2007-02-18T09:13:00.000Z	jussi01	dromer	have you tried esc?
2007-02-18T09:14:00.000Z	dromer	jussi01	YES \o/, esc and then F1 :P
2007-02-18T09:15:00.000Z	jussi01	dromer	so it worked?
2007-02-18T09:15:00.000Z	dromer	jussi01	except I can't set the boot-sequence, what is weird, when it boot's it first tries the floppy, but it doesn't get it or something :/
2007-02-18T09:16:00.000Z	jussi01	dromer	toshiba's are weird: Ill see what I can see
2007-02-18T09:16:00.000Z	dromer	jussi01	ah, I know recognise the bootsequence in the bios (weird stuff) and it's FDD->HDD, so that's right
2007-02-18T09:17:00.000Z	jussi01	dromer	hmmm... you dont have a cd??
2007-02-18T09:18:00.000Z	dromer	jussi01	actually I'm trying an install of debian sarge :$ like this http://www.linux-on-laptops.com/hosted/t4900b.html  only with these images: http://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/sarge/main/installer-i386/current/images/floppy/
2007-02-18T09:18:00.000Z	dromer	jussi01	no cdrom no :P
2007-02-18T09:18:00.000Z	dromer	jussi01	I need to do a network install, I'd like to try ubuntu otherwise, is there a minimal network install for ubuntu available?
2007-02-18T09:19:00.000Z	jussi01	dromer	Im not sure mate... got to run...--->
