2010-10-29T04:15:00.000Z	rww	unitedpotsmokers	Desktop or Alternate CD?
2010-10-29T04:16:00.000Z	unitedpotsmokers	rww	maverick desktop 32bit
2010-10-29T04:16:00.000Z	rww	unitedpotsmokers	You can't. The only way to do CD-sourced upgrades is with the alternate CD.
2010-10-29T04:18:00.000Z	rww	unitedpotsmokers	Depends heavily on your internet connection, which packages you have installed, and your computer, so we can't really tell.

2010-10-30T03:27:00.000Z	unitedpotsmokers	rww	thanks...
2010-10-30T03:28:00.000Z	unitedpotsmokers	rww	what a common problem when upgrade from lucid to maverick?
2010-10-30T03:30:00.000Z	rww	unitedpotsmokers	see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MaverickMeerkat/ReleaseNotes , it has all the notable known issues for Maverick and upgrades to it.
2010-10-30T04:31:00.000Z	unitedpotsmokers	rww	the link u gave to me its only show how to upgrade maverick using cd... i dont have cd, but thumb drive
2010-10-30T04:31:00.000Z	rww	unitedpotsmokers	Umm. You said you had "10.10 alternate cd". Alternate CDs can't be LiveUSBs, so you presumably either have the CD itself or an ISO of it, and the instructions I gave cover both.
2010-10-30T04:33:00.000Z	unitedpotsmokers	rww	yes i download 10.10 alternate cd. and i use "startup disk creator" extract the files to thumb drive..
2010-10-30T04:35:00.000Z	rww	unitedpotsmokers	then go back, get the ISO you used, and put that on the USB stick instead. No point in complicating things by making it a startup disk.
2010-10-30T04:42:00.000Z	unitedpotsmokers	rww	now i copy iso into thumb drive...

2010-10-30T06:25:00.000Z	rww	unitedpotsmokers	Not sure, I'm not that great at dependency problems in upgrades. Try asking the rest of the channel.
