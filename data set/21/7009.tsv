2007-03-10T06:49:00.000Z	kaktus		Hi! I'm a widnowsuser that is curious about installing linux, because I'm tired of all the problems in Windows
2007-03-10T06:49:00.000Z	kaktus		Could someone help me on the way?
2007-03-10T06:50:00.000Z	kaktus		Will you help me choosing the right distro please?

2007-03-10T06:51:00.000Z	Huffalump	kaktus	- 99.9% of the time, it "just works" and if you hit a snag, the community is great
2007-03-10T06:53:00.000Z	Huffalump	kaktus	- NTFS is a problem
2007-03-10T06:54:00.000Z	Huffalump	kaktus	- You're going to have some difficulties, if you cannot convert that external drive to Win32
2007-03-10T06:57:00.000Z	Huffalump	kaktus	- NTFS is going to be a limitation for you.
2007-03-10T06:59:00.000Z	Huffalump	kaktus	- I have run Windows as a virtual machine inside of Linux, using vmware
2007-03-10T07:12:00.000Z	Huffalump	kaktus	 - Personally, I recomment Partition Magic... because I've never had a failure with it under Windows.
2007-03-10T07:12:00.000Z	Huffalump	kaktus	- Edu is for students.  Xubuntu is for freaks ;)  hehe.  Ubuntu or Kubuntu are the choices you should focus on.

2007-03-11T06:07:00.000Z	Huffalump	kaktus	you formatted whole external disk after swearing up and down you needed to be NTFS?
2007-03-11T06:09:00.000Z	kaktus	Huffalump	I'm sorry that I sweared at you, didn't mean to hurt you. Anyhow: I became frustrated because I got 100 different solutions yesterday
2007-03-11T06:10:00.000Z	Huffalump	kaktus	just a figure of speech!  So, what did you do?  You freed up space on the NTFS drive, but kept some files on it.  Then you did what?  Took the 'free space' and split it into a partition, which you formatted ext3 (or ext2)?  And still left some of your files in an NTFS partition?
2007-03-11T06:12:00.000Z	kaktus	Huffalump	It was a joke. I copied what I needed to DVDR from the external HDD, and now the external HDD is a blank formatted ext2 HDD
2007-03-11T06:12:00.000Z	Huffalump	kaktus	I see.  What did tool did you use to format?
2007-03-11T06:15:00.000Z	Huffalump	kaktus	yeah Partition Magic is pretty sweet from Windows.  But you've got nothing to lose by trying to re-format again.
2007-03-11T06:25:00.000Z	kaktus	Huffalump	Can I send you the screenshot?
2007-03-11T06:25:00.000Z	Huffalump	kaktus	fire away
2007-03-11T06:27:00.000Z	kaktus	Huffalump	Couldn't send you the file, as Im not a registered user
