2008-07-14T03:59:00.000Z	Enanito		hello
2008-07-14T04:00:00.000Z	Enanito		I really need some assistance installing my video drivers... Ive been following every single tutorial on google and still not getting to make my ati mobility radeon 9000 video card to work
2008-07-14T04:00:00.000Z	Enanito		and when i get to restricted drivers there is no ati driver to select
2008-07-14T04:00:00.000Z	Enanito		yes fajalou
2008-07-14T04:01:00.000Z	nano_	Enanito	go to ati website and dload the latest drivers for your hardware
2008-07-14T04:06:00.000Z	nano_	Enanito	looking at the ati.amd site....it seems that you have to select your OS and you specific hardware to get a driver...after this you hit "GO" and you get a *.run file....this is an linux executable....so d/load this and run it as root (i would imagine).
2008-07-14T04:07:00.000Z	nano_	Enanito	what is the name of the ati-linux driver that you want to use
2008-07-14T04:07:00.000Z	nano_	Enanito	"vesa" driver is basic linux provided, non ati driver.
2008-07-14T04:09:00.000Z	nano_	Enanito	post your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file to a pastesite so i can see
2008-07-14T04:10:00.000Z	nano_	Enanito	do you currently have graphics?
2008-07-14T04:13:00.000Z	nano_	Enanito	mesa is a standard - non accelerated - linux video driver...
2008-07-14T04:13:00.000Z	nano_	Enanito	if you have any sort of graphics then its not possible for /etc/X11/xorg.conf to be empty....are you sure you have read rights to this file?
2008-07-14T04:18:00.000Z	nano_	Enanito	if you really don't have a xorg.conf file....i guess what i would do is try  to reconfigure X from square 1...you can do this by issuing....."dpkg-reconfigure xorg" as root
2008-07-14T04:20:00.000Z	nano_	Enanito	i can't help you configure your X without this file....i don't know how you can have graphics and not have this file....believe me, it is impossible for X to run without this file!!
2008-07-14T04:20:00.000Z	nano_	Enanito	and somehow you are running X without this file...i'm not sure....no prob.
2008-07-14T04:21:00.000Z	nano_	Enanito	okay xserver-xorg
2008-07-14T04:23:00.000Z	nano_	Enanito	sweet ..please do.
2008-07-14T04:26:00.000Z	nano_	Enanito	your xorg.conf looks good....can you post the output of the following command "lsmod | grep ati"
2008-07-14T04:28:00.000Z	nano_	Enanito	 issue the following command "modprobe -i ati"
2008-07-14T04:29:00.000Z	nano_	Enanito	okay, ati driver is setup in your xorg.conf file but its not installed.
2008-07-14T04:29:00.000Z	nano_	Enanito	now, d/load and install the *.run file from ATI website and run it as root.
