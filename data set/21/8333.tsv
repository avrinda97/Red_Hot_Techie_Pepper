2009-09-16T08:04:00.000Z	coz_	Argos	 is this a package or directory on your system?
2009-09-16T08:04:00.000Z	coz_	Argos	oh!  mm let me check
2009-09-16T08:05:00.000Z	coz_	Argos	 right click the process  and kill it
2009-09-16T08:05:00.000Z	coz_	Argos	  tell us what happens
2009-09-16T08:05:00.000Z	coz_	Argos	 I have never seen a process like that running

2009-09-16T08:08:00.000Z	coz_	Argos	  you can try that yes
2009-09-16T08:08:00.000Z	coz_	Argos	  I would use  killall

2009-09-16T08:10:00.000Z	coz_	Argos	  let me take a look at this
2009-09-16T08:11:00.000Z	coz_	Argos	 you could add that killall to the startup applications however it would be more efficient to uninstall waht you installed
2009-09-16T08:11:00.000Z	coz_	Argos	 hold on let me check this out
2009-09-16T08:15:00.000Z	coz_	Argos	 did an icon appear n ear the system clock?
2009-09-16T08:16:00.000Z	coz_	Argos	 mm I believe there were right click options under that icon
2009-09-16T08:18:00.000Z	coz_	Argos	 I think you have to uninstall something named  boinc
2009-09-16T08:19:00.000Z	coz_	Argos	 dont do that again :)
