2008-03-04T20:40:00.000Z	hackeron		hey, quick question - I have an amplified microphone plugged into line-in on the back of the PC - how do I get ekiga to use it? - It seems to only want to use microphones plugged into mic-in
2008-03-04T20:42:00.000Z	LjL	hackeron	i don't have Ekiga, but isn't it just a matter of enabling line-in recording in the GNOME mixer?
2008-03-04T20:43:00.000Z	hackeron	LjL	I see a mic selection - I can choose mic1 or mic2, that's it :( - I can change the volume but that's output volume, not input volume
2008-03-04T20:43:00.000Z	LjL	hackeron	is that in the mixer, or in Ekiga?
2008-03-04T20:44:00.000Z	hackeron	LjL	mixer- there's nothing in ekiga
2008-03-04T20:44:00.000Z	hackeron	LjL	it just allows me to pick my soundcard
2008-03-04T20:45:00.000Z	LjL	hackeron	i'm on KDE so can't really relate to the GNOME mixer, but i think there have to be recording selections. can you pastebin the output of « amixer » ?
2008-03-04T20:45:00.000Z	hackeron	LjL	I tried various mixers :)
2008-03-04T20:45:00.000Z	hackeron	LjL	not amixer though - what can I do with amixer?
2008-03-04T20:46:00.000Z	LjL	hackeron	the same things you can do with any other mixer. but aside from KMix, it's the only one i can give you instructions about (and the only one giving complete output to pastebin)
2008-03-04T20:47:00.000Z	hackeron	LjL	hmm, wait mixer says capture: off -- how do I turn it on, lo
2008-03-04T20:47:00.000Z	hackeron	LjL	amixer*
2008-03-04T20:47:00.000Z	LjL	hackeron	can you please just pastebin the entire output first?
2008-03-04T20:48:00.000Z	hackeron	LjL	I'm using a 10" touchscreen with no right click, lol - but it says for linein that capture: off
2008-03-04T20:49:00.000Z	hackeron	LjL	let me see if I can do anything with the help of the man page, one sec
2008-03-04T20:50:00.000Z	hackeron	LjL	oh beautiful! - I had to press space in alsamixer - itworks now!
2008-03-04T20:50:00.000Z	hackeron	LjL	thanks!
2008-03-04T20:51:00.000Z	hackeron	LjL	wonder how the echo cancellaton is on line-in -- got a terrible echo in the test, lets make a call :)
2008-03-04T20:52:00.000Z	LjL	hackeron	uhm, i don't think echo cancellation is a soundcard thing, but rather a software thing done within Ekiga
2008-03-04T20:52:00.000Z	LjL	hackeron	of course you should have playback for line-in *disabled* in the mixer
2009-04-01T06:15:00.000Z	hackeron	LjL	thanks
