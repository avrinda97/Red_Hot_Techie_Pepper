2006-01-11T15:45:00.000Z	kameron		i'm trying to mount a removable usb thumb drive.
2006-01-11T15:45:00.000Z	kameron		anyone done that before?
2006-01-11T15:46:00.000Z	beardy	kameron	What filesystem does the drive have?
2006-01-11T15:46:00.000Z	kameron	beardy	no idea. what fs do they usually have?
2006-01-11T15:46:00.000Z	beardy	kameron	It depends on what it is, an USB-stick? Cameras usually have FAT16.
2006-01-11T15:47:00.000Z	kameron	beardy	it's a run of the mill usb flash/thumb drive.. by sandisk.
2006-01-11T15:47:00.000Z	beardy	kameron	Anyway, do you know it's devicename?
2006-01-11T15:47:00.000Z	kameron	beardy	no. in mandrake, it's /dev/sda1
2006-01-11T15:48:00.000Z	beardy	kameron	Have you plugged it in? If not, plug it in and run 'dmesg' and see if it lists it.
2006-01-11T15:49:00.000Z	kameron	beardy	it's plugged in, the output of dmesg was massive.
2006-01-11T15:50:00.000Z	beardy	kameron	It should be at the bottom if you just plugged it in, take it out and put it back in, and run it again.

2006-01-11T15:54:00.000Z	beardy	kameron	It says sda, so it probablyis /dev/sda1 as you said earlier. If you don't know the filesystem, mount should be able to find it out automatically, just run 'mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/test' (or where you want to mount it, create the mountpoint if doesn't exist first.) More info about mount in it's manpage.
2006-01-11T15:58:00.000Z	kameron	beardy	i tried sda1, sda, and usb, they all didn't work. listing /dev shows me there is no /sda1
2006-01-11T16:00:00.000Z	beardy	kameron	Hmm, might be this long one then, worth a try at least, /dev/scsi/host13/bus0/target0/lun0

2006-01-11T16:05:00.000Z	kameron	beardy	oh gosh. i just unplugged the device, and plugged it back in. it really enjoyed that, and decided not only to mount it, but open the device in nautilus.
2006-01-11T16:06:00.000Z	kameron	beardy	*shakes head*. i won't bother booting with it plugged in.
2006-01-11T16:06:00.000Z	beardy	kameron	Oh, that's good.
2006-01-11T16:07:00.000Z	beardy	kameron	And if you run 'mount' now, what does it say it's device name is?
2006-01-11T16:11:00.000Z	beardy	kameron	Ok
