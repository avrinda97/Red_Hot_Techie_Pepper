2006-06-09T07:25:00.000Z	Warbo	Alfred_	The point is that it is a text file, not a ".txt" file :)
2006-06-09T07:27:00.000Z	Warbo	Alfred_	MacOSX? That is generally a Windows/MSDOS habit. Oh well, never mind :)
2006-06-09T07:29:00.000Z	Alfred_	Warbo	RandolphCarter:  really? Well, everytime I open TextEdit it saves the files with a .txt-extension. well well :) hehe I'll try to make this script you just gave me RandolphCarter. :)
2006-06-09T07:30:00.000Z	Warbo	Alfred_	That's probably to keep compatibility with Windows users (sorry, but many OSX users are idiots who wouldn't realise the problem [that is not really offensive, because Ubuntu should strive for this level of simplicity] )
2006-06-09T07:33:00.000Z	Alfred_	Warbo	RandolphCarter: huh... Well, I get youur point with simplicity, but instead of calling the MacOsX users idiots, I would direct that to the OSX developers :-)
2006-06-09T07:33:00.000Z	Warbo	Alfred_	I was trying to say that you need NO computer knowledge to use MacOSX
2006-06-09T07:35:00.000Z	Alfred_	Warbo	RandolphCarter : Well, if i'm not too far away, I guess that's Mr. Steve Jobs' point - making computing easy :) (btw, I didn't find your remark offensive)
2006-06-09T07:38:00.000Z	Warbo	Alfred_	They are both really the same, but Apple cannot get away with what Microsoft do because they are not powerful enough
2006-06-09T07:40:00.000Z	Warbo	Alfred_	MacOSX is not that bad as an OS, and it gives you some measure of compatibility so if I had a Mac I probably wouldn't REPLACE MacOSX. Although I would run Linux day-to-day.
2006-06-09T07:40:00.000Z	Warbo	Alfred_	(mind you, I have only ever used MacOSX in a museum information point so what do I know? :))
2006-06-09T07:42:00.000Z	Alfred_	Warbo	RandolphCarter: I don't know about that, Warbo, personally I'm pretty tired of OSX, which I never get of Ubuntu :) But it is a good OS, it sure is, it beats Windows that's for sure, but then again, everything does (whoops, being nosey here) :))
2006-06-09T07:47:00.000Z	Alfred_	Warbo	RandolphCarter: Okay RandolphCarter, all done. Now all I have to do is reactivating Firestarter, and perform a reboot. see you in 1 minute :)
2006-06-11T13:15:00.000Z	Warbo	Alfred_	You can reinstall GRUB from a LiveCD after Windoze is installed
2006-06-11T13:17:00.000Z	Warbo	Alfred_	You have Ubuntu installed, now install XP (I assume you left space) then run a livecd and do "sudo grub-install /dev/hda" where /dev/hda is your harddrive
2006-06-11T13:18:00.000Z	Warbo	Alfred_	Use /dev/hda (or your drive) not hda1, otherwise it will not get installed to MBR
2006-06-11T13:19:00.000Z	Warbo	Alfred_	Yep
2006-06-11T13:22:00.000Z	Warbo	Alfred_	There are examples on adding a windows partition contained within the file (it is /boot/grub/menu.lst)
2006-06-11T13:23:00.000Z	Warbo	Alfred_	As LeaChim says, 1 step at a time
2006-06-11T13:23:00.000Z	Alfred_	Warbo	LeaChim : Wait I think I jus got it from Bennyboy : http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Dapper#How_to_restore_GRUB_menu_after_Windows_installation
2006-06-11T13:23:00.000Z	Warbo	Alfred_	That's the one
2006-06-11T13:24:00.000Z	Alfred_	Warbo	LeaChim thanks a lot! See you again soon, then! :) By the way, are you registered on www.ubuntuforums.org?
