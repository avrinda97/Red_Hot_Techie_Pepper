2009-08-27T07:03:00.000Z	xps9000	dividebyzer0	I searched for what you are having trouble with, but, apparently, I cannot find it. Could you explain to me why you feel you might have to go to back to Failzors (Windows), I might be able to help
2009-08-27T07:04:00.000Z	dividebyzer0	xps9000	I need to do some video editing and nothing seems to work right on ubuntu
2009-08-27T07:04:00.000Z	xps9000	dividebyzer0	Video card make/model?
2009-08-27T07:05:00.000Z	dividebyzer0	xps9000	Nvidia Geforce 8700M-GT
2009-08-27T07:05:00.000Z	xps9000	dividebyzer0	What exact problem are you having? By the way, xorg.conf is not hard to edit, if that's where your issue lies.
2009-08-27T07:06:00.000Z	xps9000	dividebyzer0	Descriptions please
2009-08-27T07:07:00.000Z	dividebyzer0	xps9000	thats pretty much it.. I add my mp4 and maybe an mp3 and it will crash
2009-08-27T07:07:00.000Z	dividebyzer0	xps9000	cinelerra is a video editing software for linux
2009-08-27T07:09:00.000Z	xps9000	dividebyzer0	What program did you use on windows to do your video editing?
2009-08-27T07:10:00.000Z	xps9000	dividebyzer0	Ok, I'm trying to give you some options, so, bare with me.
2009-08-27T07:11:00.000Z	xps9000	dividebyzer0	I've never worked with this software, so, I'm doing alittle research to figure out if this is a known bug.
2009-08-27T07:11:00.000Z	dividebyzer0	xps9000	thanks, Ive heard of KDEnLive, cinelerra, and a couple other things but nothing works that great for linux yet
2009-08-27T07:12:00.000Z	xps9000	dividebyzer0	Have you considered using wine? And installing your video apps on it? (Winters API on linux)
2009-08-27T07:13:00.000Z	dividebyzer0	xps9000	yes, and it didnt work that great, I tried with virtualbox too and the video lagged really bad
2009-08-27T07:13:00.000Z	xps9000	dividebyzer0	Also, I need to know... Does Cine crash? Or does it lock up?
2009-08-27T07:14:00.000Z	dividebyzer0	xps9000	it just exits. completely closes out
2009-08-27T07:15:00.000Z	xps9000	dividebyzer0	How long have you been running Ubuntu? Have you installed the restricted drivers the Ubuntu recommends?
2009-08-27T07:15:00.000Z	dividebyzer0	xps9000	probably a couple weeks now, Ive installed everything that it has asked, and the correct one for my video card
2009-08-27T07:16:00.000Z	xps9000	dividebyzer0	Ok, still reading on this software, bare with me
2009-08-27T07:18:00.000Z	xps9000	dividebyzer0	When you installed the software, did you see any errors? Did you install it via terminal or via the manager?
