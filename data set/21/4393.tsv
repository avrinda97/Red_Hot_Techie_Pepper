2008-05-04T16:05:00.000Z	i4x	fde	do you know how do I fix this problem? dpkg-deb: control directory has bad permissions 777 (must be >=0755 and <=0775)
2008-05-04T16:07:00.000Z	fde	i4x	try chown 0755 /var/lib/dpkg
2008-05-04T16:07:00.000Z	fde	i4x	sudo that
2008-05-04T16:07:00.000Z	fde	i4x	Why it'd be different, idk though... did you change it?
2008-05-04T16:08:00.000Z	fde	i4x	^^
2008-05-04T16:09:00.000Z	i4x	fde	i'm trying for my first time to build a package.. and that gives me that problem when I dpkg-deb --build it!!
2008-05-04T16:10:00.000Z	i4x	fde	i've already tried this too: find ./debian -type d | xargs chmod 755
2008-05-04T16:10:00.000Z	fde	i4x	look around https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment you shouldn't generally be using dpkg-deb yourself.
2008-05-04T16:12:00.000Z	i4x	fde	y not? is that "dangerous"? :) just asking!
2008-05-04T16:12:00.000Z	fde	i4x	Although that doesn't really help your current problem...
2008-05-04T16:12:00.000Z	fde	i4x	It just results in more work, and there are easier alternatives...
2008-05-04T16:13:00.000Z	fde	i4x	You need the source directory to have a /debian dir too, and there are tools to easily populate all the things needed.
2008-05-04T16:14:00.000Z	fde	i4x	Trying to create a .deb from a normal source tar.gz etc will not work.
2008-05-04T16:14:00.000Z	i4x	fde	ok! thx!! i'll see it!! :) but, just wondering (?) you could see any problem in this how to, please take a look: http://tldp.org/HOWTO/html_single/Debian-Binary-Package-Building-HOWTO/
2008-05-04T16:15:00.000Z	fde	i4x	tldp hasn't been well maintained since the late 90's... hah
2008-05-04T16:15:00.000Z	fde	i4x	You should use docs from the distro, not random tldp stuff
2008-05-04T16:16:00.000Z	i4x	fde	:S ..thx again!! i'll take a note of it!
2008-05-04T16:17:00.000Z	fde	i4x	If you're researching something for Ubuntu/Debian... stick a 'ubuntu' into the google search... it'll return ubuntuforums or ubuntu wiki pages... those are your best bet.
2008-05-04T16:27:00.000Z	i4x	fde	gosh.. i'm feeling as I spent the time learning how to spend time, thinking I was learning an easiest way to build packages!! thx again the help! :D
2008-05-04T16:28:00.000Z	fde	i4x	heh... debian developers are great, they're lazy, so they provide things to enable that, and the rest of us benefit :)
2008-05-04T16:28:00.000Z	fde	i4x	debianutils is full of other such scripts and tools  :)
