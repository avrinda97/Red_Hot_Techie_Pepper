2006-08-27T09:35:00.000Z	MattRhodes		when using automatix, at the end of a package installation it prompts me to choose if I want to restore my original source file, should I click ok or cancel?
2006-08-27T09:35:00.000Z	ladydoor	MattRhodes	something you might do is to back up your original source file and hit yes, and then copy-paste any lines you want to keep into the new one
2006-08-27T09:36:00.000Z	MattRhodes	ladydoor	hi again, sorry I'm still a n00b I'm afraid, I dont even know what a source file is, let alone finding it :p
2006-08-27T09:37:00.000Z	ladydoor	MattRhodes	oh! lol. sorry. don't worry, we're all noobs at heart :-). and it's at /etc/apt/sources.list. so do "cp /etc/apt/sources.list ~/sources.list.bak
2006-08-27T09:38:00.000Z	MattRhodes	ladydoor	btw I've made some headway with the greeter crash, a couple of other people have made an entry on the forum about it, but no-one knows what to do about it, but I discovered if I choose plain theme it still gives the crash message but loads the theme, and if I choose themed it gives the crash message and loads Gnome Desktop Manager, so at least I get my theme, lol
2006-08-27T09:39:00.000Z	ladydoor	MattRhodes	well, i'm glad you're making headway :-D
2006-08-27T09:41:00.000Z	MattRhodes	ladydoor	also I used automatix to install the OpenOffice clipart, but I cant find it anywhere, would that be because I restored the original source file?
2006-08-27T09:41:00.000Z	ladydoor	MattRhodes	you should still be able to find it...try restarting openoffice?
2006-08-27T09:42:00.000Z	MattRhodes	ladydoor	okay, once its installed should there be an option added to openoffice for clipart?
2006-08-27T09:42:00.000Z	ladydoor	MattRhodes	i *think* so...i don't use openoffice, but that would be my guess :-)
2006-08-27T09:42:00.000Z	MattRhodes	ladydoor	cheers
2006-08-27T09:43:00.000Z	ladydoor	MattRhodes	lol...thanks. you would've figured it out though :-)
2006-08-27T09:43:00.000Z	MattRhodes	ladydoor	btw what is the 'source list' ?
2006-08-27T09:44:00.000Z	ladydoor	MattRhodes	it's a file that tells apt-get (which is what synaptic, aptitude, etc. are frontends to) where to look for packages
2006-08-27T09:45:00.000Z	MattRhodes	ladydoor	ahh right
2006-08-27T09:47:00.000Z	ladydoor	MattRhodes	later on you'll probably end up adding lines to it if you want some weirdo thiny that's not in the repos. it's basically just copy-paste stuff
2006-08-27T09:48:00.000Z	MattRhodes	ladydoor	what is likely to happen if I let automatix overwrite my source file?
2006-08-27T09:49:00.000Z	ladydoor	MattRhodes	i don't know what it would overwrite it with, which is why i'd suggest making a backup. but as to the lines it would put in there, it would basically allow for easy upgrades of everything it installed. as it is, they'll just be static
2006-08-27T09:49:00.000Z	ladydoor	MattRhodes	which in most cases hopefully shouldn't be an issue. i didn't let it overwrite mine.
2006-08-27T09:50:00.000Z	MattRhodes	ladydoor	okay, thanks for the help again :)
2006-08-27T09:50:00.000Z	ladydoor	MattRhodes	glad to help!
