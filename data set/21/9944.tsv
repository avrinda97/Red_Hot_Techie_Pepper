2005-11-01T17:13:00.000Z	signius		it seems to be in fedora and also for os-x so makes me think it maybe
2005-11-01T17:14:00.000Z	signius		DIanWei do you have all the repositries available
2005-11-01T17:16:00.000Z	signius		DIanWei having a read about this i reckon you are going to have problems with libs also
2005-11-01T17:17:00.000Z	signius		DIanWei you need to get wxGTK and also wxGTK-devel as well i think
2005-11-01T17:18:00.000Z	signius		DIanWei probably
2005-11-01T17:19:00.000Z	signius		DIanWei also need the libwxgtk libwxgtkgl and libwxgtk-devel also
2005-11-01T14:49:00.000Z	signius		WOO HOO my new Senao Wireless card just arrived from the postman :-)
2005-11-01T14:50:00.000Z	signius		200mW with Prism 2.5 chipset and 2 x External Antenna Jacks
2005-11-01T14:51:00.000Z	signius		How sad is it that i can get so excited over some new hardware
2005-11-01T14:51:00.000Z	signius		LOL
2005-11-01T14:51:00.000Z	Severian	signius	that is a good nic.  It should work well.
2005-11-01T14:52:00.000Z	signius		Yeah i had to search around a bit for a UK supplier but i am so fed up with all the problems the various wireless nics got under Linux
2005-11-01T14:53:00.000Z	Severian	signius	On my Prism 2 and 2.5 card, I never had any problem under Linux.  I just plug them in and they work.  I use them at the local library and at a local restaurant.
2005-11-01T14:53:00.000Z	signius		Orinoco have to contqastantly patch the kernel for RFMON my cisco aironet card the UBUNTU 2.6.12 kernel is broken and cant work properly as the kernel is broken (which is completely un-accpetable to break such an old and solid chipsetset driver)
2005-11-01T14:54:00.000Z	signius		i have various other wireless nics that i can get working with ndiswrappers but they wont support RFMON either
2005-11-01T14:55:00.000Z	signius		The cisco aironet card is absolutely fantastic and a very capable card i cannot believe the kernel guys have broken the kernel for these cards
2005-11-01T14:55:00.000Z	signius	Severian	I have heard the Prism 3 chipset isnt so great under Linux tho
2005-11-01T14:56:00.000Z	signius	Severian	which is a shame as the senao prism 3 card with 2 x externals was a third of the price
2005-11-01T14:56:00.000Z	signius	Severian	which would have been an absolute bargain at 15 by any standards
2005-11-01T14:57:00.000Z	Severian	signius	I don't have any with 2 antennae.  But, mine were all prety cheap  The most I paid was $20.  I imagine 2 attannae helps the range.
2005-11-01T14:59:00.000Z	signius	Severian	yes i got a real cheap external omni antenna and it performs really well my only hassle now is getting my GPS to work through my usb to serial adapter which i had working under Hoary but i havnt managed to get it working under breezy and like an idiot i forgot to write down the settings befire i upgraded and cant get it working for the life of me now :-(
