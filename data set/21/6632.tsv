2007-02-26T14:02:00.000Z	ikonia	htmljunkie	why advertise that fact - its nothing to do with ubuntu and we are not talking about web development
2007-03-05T09:25:00.000Z	ikonia	htmljunkie	I have done in the past, sorry I missed your initial comment
2007-03-05T09:26:00.000Z	htmljunkie	ikonia	seems like the webdiner is a dead channel, I have to abandon it

2007-03-05T09:27:00.000Z	ikonia	htmljunkie	thank yo u
2007-03-05T09:27:00.000Z	ikonia	htmljunkie	you need to use fetchmail to get your mail from yahoo then use pine to read it locally
2007-03-05T09:28:00.000Z	ikonia	htmljunkie	pine can't access yahoo mail on the yahoo servers,
2007-03-05T09:28:00.000Z	ikonia	htmljunkie	yup fetch mail
2007-03-05T09:28:00.000Z	ikonia	htmljunkie	install fetchmail and read the wiki on how to get mail from sites
2007-03-05T09:28:00.000Z	ikonia	htmljunkie	then use pine to read that mail
2007-03-05T09:29:00.000Z	ikonia	htmljunkie	why are you asking in ubuntu then ?
2007-03-05T09:40:00.000Z	ikonia	htmljunkie	no fetchmail - you're screwed
2007-03-05T09:41:00.000Z	ikonia	htmljunkie	what does it matter if it gets distributed or not - its available now
2007-03-05T09:41:00.000Z	ikonia	htmljunkie	not really thats just personal opinion
2007-03-05T09:43:00.000Z	ikonia	htmljunkie	thats just experience
2008-01-07T01:25:00.000Z	ikonia	htmljunkie	this is ubuntu support - we are not interested in OSx or BSD
