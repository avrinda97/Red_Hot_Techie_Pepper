2011-11-24T03:20:00.000Z	ubuntunoob		its not possible
2011-11-24T03:20:00.000Z	ubuntunoob		its xfce's window manager but its really heavy
2011-11-24T03:20:00.000Z	ubuntunoob		'so you want fluxbox
2011-11-24T03:22:00.000Z	ubuntunoob		yeah
2011-11-24T03:22:00.000Z	ubuntunoob		just reboot or log out
2011-11-24T03:22:00.000Z	ubuntunoob		and choose xfce
2011-11-24T03:23:00.000Z	ubuntunoob		oh and use lxdm instead of xfce's login manager
2011-11-24T03:23:00.000Z	ubuntunoob		its better
2011-11-24T03:24:00.000Z	ubuntunoob		well remove gdm then
2011-11-24T03:24:00.000Z	ubuntunoob		and use lxdm
2011-11-24T03:25:00.000Z	lunitik	ubuntunoob	no need to get rid of it, just choose lxdm when you install it... debconf will keep everything sane, but otherwise you are removing meta-packages which help maintain the system
2011-11-24T03:32:00.000Z	lunitik	ubuntunoob	that actually wouldn't work because it is just a meta-package... debfoster or deborphan would make it easy to clean up after though
2011-11-24T03:33:00.000Z	lunitik	ubuntunoob	(also wouldn't work because it is unlikely you installed ubuntu-desktop by hand... came during the install for most)
2011-11-24T03:34:00.000Z	lunitik	ubuntunoob	that's what I'm saying, it wouldn't actually do that because nothing was installed as a dep of it for most people...
2011-11-24T03:34:00.000Z	lunitik	ubuntunoob	even then, apt/dpkg doesn't care much about the deps of a meta-package once you remove it... lesson learned the hard way, and why I used to love debfoster
2011-11-24T03:38:00.000Z	lunitik	ubuntunoob	no seriously, apt-cache show debfoster
2011-11-24T03:39:00.000Z	lunitik	ubuntunoob	nothing, just, why do something by hand which can be automated?
2011-11-24T03:40:00.000Z	lunitik	ubuntunoob	it is really why Debian and thus Ubuntu is so awesome... hackers being lazy and hacking things together to allow their laziness
2011-11-24T03:44:00.000Z	lunitik	ubuntunoob	lubuntu then... and thus why Ubuntu is awesome: choice and freedom
2011-11-24T03:45:00.000Z	lunitik	ubuntunoob	umm, so you use wheezy
2011-11-24T03:46:00.000Z	lunitik	ubuntunoob	precise is merging from wheezy atm, there should be little difference in package versions there, and where there is difference, Ubuntu will be more recent in every case
