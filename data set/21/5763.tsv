2007-11-05T08:52:00.000Z	SpeakerMania	scguy318	here is my original problem: I was using my Ubuntu rig running 7.10. A power surge/power outage occured for ~5 seconds. My computer turned off. Upon boot, I get the following: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/43378/
2007-11-22T03:06:00.000Z	scguy318	SpeakerMania	you're supposed to be taken to a shell so you can type fsck, but
2007-11-22T03:06:00.000Z	scguy318	SpeakerMania	boot to LiveCD, run fsck
2007-11-22T03:06:00.000Z	SpeakerMania	scguy318	if can find mine...
2007-11-22T03:07:00.000Z	scguy318	SpeakerMania	just do what soundray suggested, sounds good to me :)
2007-11-22T03:10:00.000Z	SpeakerMania	scguy318	I'm getting the same screen. I think I need the root password to get the shell. My password doesn't work, and I thought the root password/account is "frozen" in ubuntu
2007-11-22T03:10:00.000Z	scguy318	SpeakerMania	hmm
2007-11-22T03:11:00.000Z	scguy318	SpeakerMania	I know for a fact that you should be dragged to a shell, that happened to me on Feisty, but, I guess LiveCD is the best bet
2007-11-22T03:12:00.000Z	SpeakerMania	scguy318	okay.
2007-11-22T03:12:00.000Z	scguy318	SpeakerMania	theres also a suggestion to
2007-11-22T03:13:00.000Z	scguy318	SpeakerMania	boot with option init=/bin/bash
2007-11-22T03:13:00.000Z	scguy318	SpeakerMania	then doing
2007-11-22T03:13:00.000Z	scguy318	SpeakerMania	mount -o remount,ro /
2007-11-22T03:13:00.000Z	scguy318	SpeakerMania	but I guess LiveCD is best bet
2007-11-22T03:13:00.000Z	SpeakerMania	scguy318	how do I boot with that option?
2007-11-22T03:13:00.000Z	scguy318	SpeakerMania	press e at the GRUB menu to edit your boot options, then add it
