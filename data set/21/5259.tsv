2007-11-28T04:02:00.000Z	kitche	ICQnumber_	End of File usually
2007-11-28T04:02:00.000Z	ICQnumber_	kitche	as sign!
2007-11-28T04:02:00.000Z	kitche	ICQnumber_	what do you mean as sign?
2007-11-28T04:03:00.000Z	ICQnumber_	kitche	character
2007-11-28T04:03:00.000Z	kitche	ICQnumber_	umm there isn't one ^D, ^ is ctrl  if that's what you mean
2007-11-28T04:07:00.000Z	kitche	ICQnumber_	EOF should work when using cat or just press ctrl+d
2007-11-28T04:09:00.000Z	ICQnumber_	kitche	control +d do work ty, but how to do it with EOF
2007-11-28T04:10:00.000Z	kitche	ICQnumber_	just type EOF on a line by itself
2007-11-28T04:11:00.000Z	ICQnumber_	kitche	and then, does not seems to work
2007-11-28T04:11:00.000Z	kitche	ICQnumber_	hmm works here just fine
2007-11-28T04:11:00.000Z	kitche	ICQnumber_	hang on a second
2007-11-28T04:12:00.000Z	kitche	ICQnumber_	are you doing this cat > file << "EOF" then EOF should work that way
2007-11-28T04:12:00.000Z	ICQnumber_	kitche	well, i have a file "test", so i type "cat > test", then i can enter text... and EOF is just recognized as text!
2007-11-28T04:13:00.000Z	kitche	ICQnumber_	do this cat > test << "EOF"
2007-11-28T04:14:00.000Z	kitche	ICQnumber_	then EOF will be recongized on a line by itself to close the file for writing
2007-11-28T04:14:00.000Z	ICQnumber_	kitche	well now it do work too
2007-11-28T04:16:00.000Z	kitche	ICQnumber_	you need to use ctrl+d the way you were doing it but with << "EOF" at the end of the cat command it can use EOF to End of File
2007-11-28T04:17:00.000Z	ICQnumber_	kitche	yes, ty, does it work for u by default with adding "<< eof"?
2007-11-28T04:17:00.000Z	kitche	ICQnumber_	yes that's whow I use cat if I want to write a file sicne I use cat > file << "EOF" all the time when I built LFS machines
2007-11-28T04:19:00.000Z	ICQnumber_	kitche	thank you
