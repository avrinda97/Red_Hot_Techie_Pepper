2008-11-20T22:11:00.000Z	Marfi		quick question, for the ubuntu 8.10 x86 disk, whats the default password?
2008-11-20T22:13:00.000Z	paule_	Marfi	the password is user-set
2008-11-20T22:16:00.000Z	paule_	Marfi	the user sets the password during installation
2008-11-20T22:16:00.000Z	Marfi	paule_	i know that. i use a live disk for data recovery whenever i have to pull data off of a bum hard drive. i was gone for 15 minutes (past the sudo time) and tried to sudo -i, and i couldn't get in
2008-11-20T22:17:00.000Z	paule_	Marfi	oh thought you meant an a hard disk install, not the live disk
2008-11-20T22:18:00.000Z	Marfi	paule_	hehe, np
2008-11-20T22:21:00.000Z	paule_	Marfi	hmm this is an interesting question if you have not set the password yet with the live cd
2008-11-20T22:22:00.000Z	Marfi	paule_	i've never had to set a password. i just thought that it was interesting in the fact that it wouldn't let me sudo -i from the live disk. =)
2008-11-20T22:23:00.000Z	paule_	Marfi	it should let you do that after boot, although it might stop working if you logout first
2008-11-20T22:23:00.000Z	Marfi	paule_	thats what i was figuring. ah well, must just be a glitch. =)
2008-11-20T22:23:00.000Z	paule_	Marfi	or set a password for the default ubuntu account
2008-11-20T22:24:00.000Z	paule_	Marfi	does sudo -i not work at all with the livecd?
2008-11-20T22:24:00.000Z	Marfi	paule_	it does, but after 15 minutes it doesn't
2008-11-20T22:25:00.000Z	Marfi	paule_	but as long as i have a rootshell, it can sit forever like that
2008-11-20T22:25:00.000Z	paule_	Marfi	one way to do that is by setting a password for default account
2008-11-20T22:25:00.000Z	Marfi	paule_	ah, ok. gotcha
2008-11-20T22:27:00.000Z	paule_	Marfi	yeah its a bit strange the way the sudo is disabled, but at least it won't log you out of a root shell ;)
2008-11-20T22:27:00.000Z	Marfi	paule_	agreed. and im usually sitting at the computer when im working on it, and start before the 15 min thing
2008-11-20T22:28:00.000Z	paule_	Marfi	if it is not convenient maybe it will be changed in the future
2008-11-20T22:29:00.000Z	Marfi	paule_	meh, ah well. CD is working fine for me now. =)
2008-11-20T22:29:00.000Z	Marfi	paule_	or not
