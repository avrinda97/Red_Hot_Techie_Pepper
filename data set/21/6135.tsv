2007-05-27T06:39:00.000Z	ikonia	r0bb4n_	whats the problem ?
2007-05-27T06:40:00.000Z	r0bb4n_	ikonia	cannot build amsn, it conplain about not finding tcl / tk
2007-05-27T06:40:00.000Z	ikonia	r0bb4n_	why are you not using the one out of the ubuntu repo's
2007-05-27T06:41:00.000Z	ikonia	r0bb4n_	well you've totally messed up your ubuntu dependency and package manager tree
2007-05-27T06:42:00.000Z	r0bb4n_	ikonia	hm, i will google, find a way around this
2007-05-27T06:42:00.000Z	ikonia	r0bb4n_	there are plenty of ways
2007-05-27T06:42:00.000Z	ikonia	r0bb4n_	but you've pretty much messed up your ubuntu install
2007-05-27T06:43:00.000Z	r0bb4n_	ikonia	;) just installed ubuntu so it's not a big thing but thx for your comment
2007-05-27T06:44:00.000Z	ikonia	r0bb4n_	why are you not using amsn from the repos
2007-05-27T06:44:00.000Z	r0bb4n_	ikonia	because the fonts look awful, not antialiasing
2007-05-27T06:44:00.000Z	r0bb4n_	ikonia	looks like linux did 1997
2007-05-27T06:45:00.000Z	r0bb4n_	ikonia	 14px size of the fonts, not that nice
2007-05-27T06:45:00.000Z	ikonia	r0bb4n_	just change the fonts ?
2007-05-27T06:45:00.000Z	r0bb4n_	ikonia	it's about the tcl
2007-05-27T06:46:00.000Z	r0bb4n_	ikonia	tcl 8.5 will do it, ubuntu provide 8.4
2007-05-27T06:46:00.000Z	ikonia	r0bb4n_	fair enough, you seem reasonable confident in what your doing
2007-05-27T06:46:00.000Z	r0bb4n_	ikonia	thx mate,
