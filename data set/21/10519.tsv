2008-03-11T05:26:00.000Z	Dr_willis	A86	  go to the home page and find out.
2008-03-11T05:23:00.000Z	Dr_willis	A86	 you are trying to run farcry in side windows inside virtualbox?
2008-03-11T05:23:00.000Z	Dr_willis	A86	 GOOD LUCK with that...
2008-03-11T05:23:00.000Z	Dr_willis	A86	 any 3d game will proerly not run very well.
2008-03-11T05:23:00.000Z	Dr_willis	A86	 use wine/cedega
2008-03-11T05:25:00.000Z	Dr_willis	A86	 may want to try a newer wine, or cedega. You are not going to get good 3d game play from virtualbox or vmware -
2008-03-11T05:25:00.000Z	Dr_willis	A86	 espicially a game thas as gfx intensive as farcry
2008-03-11T05:25:00.000Z	Dr_willis	A86	 there is some up to date wine repository. or go to the cedega homepage and try the demo
2008-03-11T05:28:00.000Z	Dr_willis	A86	 you are a fast reader then.. they have downloads you install
2008-03-11T05:31:00.000Z	Dr_willis	A86	 for the 'latest' wine - check --> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=624644
