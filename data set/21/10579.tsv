2005-01-30T14:14:00.000Z	subterrific		i guess i'll open a bug...ugh
2005-01-30T14:14:00.000Z	subterrific		oh
2005-01-30T14:14:00.000Z	cafuego	subterrific	You mean i can play SC4K on limux amd64? :-)
2005-01-30T14:15:00.000Z	cafuego	subterrific	sim city 4
2005-01-30T14:15:00.000Z	cafuego	subterrific	cool!
2005-01-30T14:19:00.000Z	cafuego	subterrific	Is that gentoo running a 32bit kernel or 64bit?
2005-01-30T14:20:00.000Z	cafuego	subterrific	Yeah, cedega seems to run fine without a chroot here too.
2005-01-30T14:21:00.000Z	subterrific	cafuego	all i had to do was install a 32bit libpng and add /usr/lib32 to LD_LIBRARY_PATH for cedega to run without a chroot
2005-01-30T14:24:00.000Z	subterrific	cafuego	hehe, gentoo is actually fairly decent on amd64. 5 minutes for a kernel compile and ~25 for xorg is acceptable i think
2005-01-30T14:25:00.000Z	subterrific	cafuego	they kept breaking gcc though, trying to add multilib support
2005-01-30T14:25:00.000Z	cafuego	subterrific	That's 25 minutes each time him over there *point at daniels* decides to release a new X.
2005-01-30T14:26:00.000Z	subterrific	cafuego	you're allowed to use your computer while it compiles
2005-01-30T14:26:00.000Z	cafuego	subterrific	Slows down my apps, though.
2005-01-30T14:27:00.000Z	subterrific	cafuego	you'd be surprised what nice can do
2005-01-30T14:27:00.000Z	cafuego	subterrific	Turn 25 mins into 2 hours? ;-)
2005-01-30T14:28:00.000Z	subterrific	cafuego	no, i never even needed nice
2005-01-30T14:29:00.000Z	subterrific	cafuego	athon64's are plenty fast unless you want to play a GL game while you're compiling...i wouldn't recommend that. doing anything else though, and you won't even noticed
2005-01-30T14:29:00.000Z	cafuego	subterrific	At that point it's still a waste of electricity, though.
2005-01-30T14:30:00.000Z	subterrific	cafuego	join the omish if you care that much
2005-01-30T14:30:00.000Z	cafuego	subterrific	Go burn a forest if you care that little <heh> ;-)
