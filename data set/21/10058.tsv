2005-05-22T10:45:00.000Z	jeffco		hello everyone. I'm a 1-day old Ubuntu user.
2005-05-22T10:45:00.000Z	jeffco		Ii have a question about skype.
2005-05-22T10:45:00.000Z	jeffco		anybody using skype?
2005-05-22T10:45:00.000Z	jeffco		thanks Nalioth !
2005-05-22T10:45:00.000Z	jeffco		Goodbye windows, hello Linux!
2005-05-22T10:46:00.000Z	BigJG	jeffco	what issue are you having with skype?
2005-05-22T10:47:00.000Z	jeffco	BigJG	yes hotrecorder is a program that works alongside skype.
2005-05-22T10:49:00.000Z	BigJG	jeffco	I am doing some searching right now, I don't know of anything off the top of my head
2005-05-22T10:50:00.000Z	BigJG	jeffco	I am assuming the implementation is SIP based? Or is it H.323
2005-05-22T10:57:00.000Z	jeffco	BigJG	are you there?
2005-05-22T10:58:00.000Z	BigJG	jeffco	Yea, I am still searching.
2005-05-22T11:05:00.000Z	BigJG	jeffco	I am still reading it but check out http://linuxathome.com/index.php?p=235
2005-05-22T11:11:00.000Z	BigJG	jeffco	I am about a week into ubuntu which is the first OS to ever replace my main windows, and I am loving it, the learning curve is high but the customization available is amazing!
2005-05-22T11:18:00.000Z	BigJG	jeffco	I think it would be easier to simply install firefox 1.0.3 through apt-get and not worry about it
2005-05-22T11:20:00.000Z	jeffco	BigJG	the article on skype?
2005-05-22T11:21:00.000Z	jeffco	BigJG	i had a small browse.
2005-05-22T11:21:00.000Z	BigJG	jeffco	yea well, making the voip recording using software available in linux
2005-05-22T11:21:00.000Z	BigJG	jeffco	by the sounds of it, software other than skype would be used, but the functionality looks the same
2005-05-22T11:22:00.000Z	BigJG	jeffco	yes Voip uses standardized protocols SIP or H.323 as i was talking about previously which allows different softwares to interoperate
2005-05-22T11:54:00.000Z	BigJG	jeffco	 looking for the firefox install path?
2005-05-22T11:57:00.000Z	jeffco	BigJG	what HappyFool is trying to help me with is my problem launching links from Xhat to Firefox.
