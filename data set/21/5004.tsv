2008-07-25T08:46:00.000Z	nickrud	solexious	 you can do   sudo apt-get dist-upgrade --dry-run   to see what might be necessary. No changes will be made to your system.

2008-08-07T05:30:00.000Z	solexious	nickrud	thank you
2008-08-07T05:44:00.000Z	nickrud	solexious	it gets reset by udev on boot, why do you want to change the permissions on it from the default?
2008-08-07T05:45:00.000Z	solexious	nickrud	as i want to give w/r to all
2008-08-07T05:45:00.000Z	nickrud	solexious	add what ever user you want to use the ttyS0 to the dialout group
2008-08-07T05:46:00.000Z	solexious	nickrud	how can i add root?
2008-08-07T05:46:00.000Z	solexious	nickrud	via shell
2008-08-07T05:47:00.000Z	nickrud	solexious	root owns it, has write permissions. To add some other user, do   sudo adduser <user> dialout .  Any user you add to a group is required to log out completely and then log back in for the group change to take effect
2008-08-07T05:48:00.000Z	solexious	nickrud	thank you
2009-07-13T07:08:00.000Z	nickrud	solexious	mostly with closed source stuff like flash.
2009-07-13T07:09:00.000Z	nickrud	solexious	switch10 got disconnected
2009-07-13T07:09:00.000Z	solexious	nickrud	but I take it I can dual boot with a 32 bit edition if I need it
2009-07-13T07:10:00.000Z	nickrud	solexious	mostly people would install a 32bit firefox alongside the 64bit; but I'm not sure that's even necessary any more
2009-07-13T07:10:00.000Z	solexious	nickrud	know if I would run into problems sharing a /home directory on a partition with a 32 and 64 os sharing it
2009-07-13T07:11:00.000Z	nickrud	solexious	now that I can tell you won't be a problem. I share /home between all my ubuntu versions
2009-07-13T07:12:00.000Z	nickrud	solexious	never had a problem with it
2009-07-13T07:12:00.000Z	solexious	nickrud	great :) was thinking of having another partition with ubuntu studio on it
2009-07-13T07:12:00.000Z	nickrud	solexious	I'd be cautious between distros
2009-07-13T07:13:00.000Z	solexious	nickrud	ah,ok
