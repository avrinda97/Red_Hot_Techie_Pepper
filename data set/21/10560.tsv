2005-02-04T10:58:00.000Z	bob2	lyy	do you have a mysql database you care about?
2005-02-04T10:58:00.000Z	lyy	bob2	none that i know of.
2005-02-04T10:59:00.000Z	lyy	bob2	did you remove ?
2005-02-04T10:59:00.000Z	lyy	bob2	i'll just do what you do.
2005-02-04T11:02:00.000Z	bob2	lyy	remove?  I haven't used it.
2005-02-04T11:07:00.000Z	lyy	bob2	it says to log in as mythtv and run mythtv-setup. i'm not sure how to log in as mythtv
2005-02-04T11:07:00.000Z	bob2	lyy	sudo -u mythtv -s
2005-02-04T11:11:00.000Z	lyy	bob2	running  sudo -u mythtv -s mythtv-setup gives me this error : mythtv-setup: /usr/bin/mythtv-setup: cannot execute binary file
2005-02-04T11:11:00.000Z	lyy	bob2	i tried sudo -u mythtv mythtv-setup , and i get mythtv-setup: cannot connect to X server
2005-02-04T11:12:00.000Z	bob2	lyy	yes, the former won't work
2005-02-04T11:12:00.000Z	lyy	bob2	i guess i'm sol
2005-02-04T11:12:00.000Z	bob2	lyy	maybe 'sudo su -m mythtv'
2005-02-04T11:13:00.000Z	lyy	bob2	still got mythtv-setup: cannot connect to X server
2005-02-04T11:13:00.000Z	lyy	bob2	maybe i should run it as root
2005-02-04T11:13:00.000Z	lyy	bob2	run mythtv-setup as root that is
2005-02-04T11:14:00.000Z	lyy	bob2	i guess it was a long long time since you installed this
2005-02-04T11:14:00.000Z	bob2	lyy	as I said, I never used it
2005-02-04T11:15:00.000Z	lyy	bob2	i agree hehe
