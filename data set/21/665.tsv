2011-09-05T05:50:00.000Z	urlin2u	rectec794613	where is it reading it that way?
2011-09-05T05:51:00.000Z	rectec794613	urlin2u	it shows that under the file name in nautilus
2011-09-08T06:49:00.000Z	rectec794613	urlin2u	ok, but this all happened out of nowhere
2011-09-08T06:50:00.000Z	urlin2u	rectec794613	you read both links in 1 min.
2011-09-08T06:50:00.000Z	rectec794613	urlin2u	it would be nice if you could give me a specific page with the same issue and solution as the one i'm having
2011-09-08T06:51:00.000Z	urlin2u	rectec794613	that would be nice now wouldn't it.
2011-09-08T06:51:00.000Z	rectec794613	urlin2u	I skimmed. don't blame me, I have no idea what my problem is
2011-09-08T06:51:00.000Z	urlin2u	rectec794613	what makes you think IO know one beyond the bots suggestions
2011-09-08T06:53:00.000Z	rectec794613	urlin2u	no offense, but could you please assist me in troubleshooting this so I can find out what page I need to devote my time to, instead of sending me generic sound troubleshooting links?
2011-09-08T06:54:00.000Z	urlin2u	rectec794613	demanding from a user who has stated they don't know makes no sense.
2011-09-08T06:55:00.000Z	urlin2u	rectec794613	took you a min tolook at the links chill out and adjust your attitude.
2011-09-08T06:56:00.000Z	rectec794613	urlin2u	I'm lost.
2011-09-08T06:56:00.000Z	rectec794613	urlin2u	my sound just quit for no reason, this has never happened to me before.
2011-09-08T06:57:00.000Z	urlin2u	rectec794613	I have never had a sound problem, so I have no answers.
2011-09-11T07:13:00.000Z	urlin2u	rectec794613	if turned off how you going to turn it aback off the answer is no I believe.
2011-09-11T07:15:00.000Z	rectec794613	urlin2u	well I'm not sure, I'm not an expert on this type of stuff. But Ubuntu can turn it back on automatically
2011-09-11T07:16:00.000Z	urlin2u	rectec794613	you might explan your actual reasoning here.
