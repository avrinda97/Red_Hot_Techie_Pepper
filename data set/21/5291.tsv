2009-02-04T03:43:00.000Z	corey__		I'm sure most are familiar with the dnsmasq technique to cache dns requests locally. I have not been successful in configuring this to work with a wireless device. Can someone offer some insight on what could be the issue? Seems it doesn't respond to wlan0 (but works great with eth0)
2009-02-04T03:44:00.000Z	corey__		My AP is a little far away and I'm connected at 1Mb/s. This is causing dns resolving to be painfully slow. What are my options?
2009-02-04T03:45:00.000Z	Sylphid	corey__	move the ap... add a wireless repeater, stronger wireless adapter
2009-02-04T03:46:00.000Z	corey__	Sylphid	sure money is the answer to all problems, but there should be a fix applied to dnsmasq to work with wireless devices.
2009-02-04T03:47:00.000Z	Sylphid	corey__	its not a matter of bandwidth its a matter of latency
2009-02-04T03:48:00.000Z	Sylphid	corey__	is your dns server set to your routers ip?
2009-02-04T03:48:00.000Z	corey__	Sylphid	yes.. it's the wireless latency that is causing the dns requests to drop and fail.
2009-02-04T03:49:00.000Z	corey__	Sylphid	I've configured my dns to that of OpenDNS. all tests work fine except for the > ~200ms resolve time each request.
2009-02-04T03:49:00.000Z	Sylphid	corey__	you could try a home made reflector to put on your ap's antenna although its likely the signal issue is on the adapters end
2009-02-04T03:50:00.000Z	Sylphid	corey__	200ms isnt great but its not horrible
2009-02-04T03:50:00.000Z	corey__	Sylphid	unfortunately I could not try that idea since I'm out of foil right now.
2009-02-04T03:52:00.000Z	Sylphid	corey__	your sure that its dns that slowing things down correct?
2009-02-04T03:52:00.000Z	corey__	Sylphid	positive. media is very responsive once it gets kicked into gear.
2009-02-04T03:55:00.000Z	Sylphid	corey__	whats in /etc/resolv.conf
2009-02-04T03:56:00.000Z	corey__	Sylphid	a list of my name servers. starting with localhost followed by the two opendns address and lastly my router's
2009-02-04T03:58:00.000Z	Sylphid	corey__	if you do an nslookup which server responds to the request... more specifically is the first server in /etc/resolve.conf the one that responds
2009-02-04T03:59:00.000Z	corey__	Sylphid	good hint. I see that opendns responds first.
2009-02-04T04:00:00.000Z	Sylphid	corey__	if you move the computer closer to the AP does it work better?
2009-02-04T04:01:00.000Z	corey__	Sylphid	I am unable to try that, since what is between my router and my desktop is terrain
2009-02-04T04:02:00.000Z	Sylphid	corey__	try bypassing dns and open a site by ip to see if you have the same problem
2009-02-04T04:14:00.000Z	corey__	Sylphid	I gave up hope with dnsmasq and configured dnscache. works great!!
