2007-01-26T16:44:00.000Z	Pie-rate		usplash is all messed up, anyone know why?
2007-01-26T16:44:00.000Z	darwinawards	Pie-rate	as in the boot splash?
2007-01-26T16:44:00.000Z	Pie-rate	darwinawards	yes
2007-01-26T16:44:00.000Z	darwinawards	Pie-rate	dunno, try regenerating it?
2007-01-26T16:45:00.000Z	Pie-rate	darwinawards	how?
2007-01-26T16:45:00.000Z	darwinawards	Pie-rate	try sudo apt-get install --reisntall usplash
2007-01-26T16:45:00.000Z	darwinawards	Pie-rate	try sudo apt-get install --reinstall usplash *
2007-01-26T16:45:00.000Z	Pie-rate	darwinawards	done that.
2007-01-26T16:45:00.000Z	darwinawards	Pie-rate	doesn't help?
2007-01-26T16:46:00.000Z	Pie-rate	darwinawards	also when i do that it changes it in the 386 file, not the generic one that i'm using.
2007-01-26T16:46:00.000Z	darwinawards	Pie-rate	hmm... ah well
2007-01-26T16:46:00.000Z	Pie-rate	darwinawards	i'd be happy with removing it if i could get it out of the generic thing
2007-01-26T16:46:00.000Z	darwinawards	Pie-rate	the splash is not built into the kernel
2007-01-26T16:50:00.000Z	Pie-rate	darwinawards	well why doesn't apt-get remove usplash remove it?
2007-01-26T16:50:00.000Z	darwinawards	Pie-rate	the splash file is still installed
2007-01-26T16:51:00.000Z	Pie-rate	darwinawards	why do i get usplash when i boot generic and not when i boot 386?
2007-01-26T16:51:00.000Z	darwinawards	Pie-rate	look at /boot/grub/menu.lst
2007-01-26T16:51:00.000Z	Pie-rate	darwinawards	it installs it in /boot/initrd.img-2.6.17-10-386
2007-01-26T16:52:00.000Z	Pie-rate	darwinawards	i want it to remove it from /boot/initrd.img-2.6.17-10-generic
2007-01-26T16:52:00.000Z	Pie-rate	darwinawards	or i at least want it to work
2007-01-26T16:52:00.000Z	darwinawards	Pie-rate	I *think* you can just rename or remove the file
