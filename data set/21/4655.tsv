2010-02-06T11:13:00.000Z	rosco		anyone:  i need help getting DSL on an old laptop.  i booted DSL form a bootfloppy and it is in some way running off a usb flash drive w/ DSL files ... it is asking for KNopppix and says without it i'm stuck with really small kernel.  ONe -i have xp.  aaand, i'll have to put knoppix in c:/.  i want M$  off machine
2010-02-06T11:14:00.000Z	chelz	rosco	if you want DSL then go to their IRC channel. this channel if for ubuntu
2010-02-06T11:14:00.000Z	rosco	chelz	there is no channel for dsl.  knoppix guys are very inactive.  waiting & waiting for response
2010-02-06T11:15:00.000Z	chelz	rosco	you could try (x)ubuntu. or puppy linux.
2010-02-06T13:20:00.000Z	chelz	rosco	yes, at least 8GB is necessary
2010-02-06T13:21:00.000Z	chelz	rosco	for ubuntu
2010-02-06T13:21:00.000Z	chelz	rosco	8GB or more
2010-02-06T13:22:00.000Z	rosco	chelz	adn DVS01 i'd like to give M$ say, 15GB instead of 20GB.
2010-02-06T13:22:00.000Z	chelz	rosco	what version of windows?
2010-02-06T13:23:00.000Z	rosco	chelz	^
2010-02-06T13:24:00.000Z	chelz	rosco	yeah 15 is more than enough
2010-02-06T13:24:00.000Z	chelz	rosco	install windows then install ubuntu
2010-02-06T13:26:00.000Z	rosco	chelz	windoze is installed.  i'm defragmenting and partitioning in preparation.
2010-02-06T13:26:00.000Z	chelz	rosco	let the ubuntu installer do the partitioning
2010-02-06T13:27:00.000Z	rosco	chelz	sorry, i just saw you answered that
2010-02-06T15:10:00.000Z	chelz	rosco	ubuntu with lxde
2010-02-06T15:11:00.000Z	rosco	chelz	not an option
2010-02-06T15:11:00.000Z	chelz	rosco	lubuntu is lxde
2010-02-06T15:15:00.000Z	chelz	rosco	older on the usb or on your harddrive?
2010-02-06T15:17:00.000Z	chelz	rosco	i think unetbootin will write over it
2010-03-14T07:00:00.000Z	rosco	chelz	and ubottu i'll take that b/c they look the same, there are great differences
