2008-08-14T04:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kitche	i think its ia32
2008-08-14T04:07:00.000Z	kitche	ActionParsnip	nope but ia32 is not 32bit since ia64 is not the same as x86_64
2008-08-14T04:07:00.000Z	kitche	ActionParsnip	ia32 might be some odd arch. that they might have tried using before they got ia64 working :)
2008-08-14T04:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kitche	they let you run 32bit apps
2008-08-14T04:08:00.000Z	kitche	ActionParsnip	yes but ubottu does not have that as a switch :)
2008-10-13T08:05:00.000Z	kitche	ActionParsnip	umm sudo -i is the recommended way to get a root shell if you need one
2008-10-13T08:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kitche	no need for it, just sudo each command so you dont fry your system
2008-10-13T08:06:00.000Z	kitche	ActionParsnip	hmm ok what if I m editing tons of files I don't want to sudo vi 10 times
2008-10-13T08:06:00.000Z	kitche	ActionParsnip	you see tons of things as well when people use sudo and your point?
2008-10-13T08:08:00.000Z	kitche	ActionParsnip	it can also destroy systems as well if you run the wrong command
2008-10-19T21:31:00.000Z	kitche	ActionParsnip	well he actually said what sound card it is AC97
2008-10-19T21:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kitche	i want what lspci says to make websearches easy
2008-10-19T21:32:00.000Z	kitche	ActionParsnip	umm you do know the ac97 driver works on all of the ac97 cards right?
2008-10-19T21:32:00.000Z	kitche	ActionParsnip	you can use it on a nforce sound among others
2008-10-19T21:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kitche	i still want the line for websearching
2008-10-19T21:33:00.000Z	kitche	ActionParsnip	ok then no clue why you want to web search since it's a easy fix since it's the same for all AC97's
2008-10-19T21:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kitche	if i have the line i can websearch for that and find a decent link
2008-10-19T21:34:00.000Z	kitche	ActionParsnip	yes but AC97 is in almost all computers
2008-10-19T21:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kitche	there is method in my madness
2008-10-19T21:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kitche	not in any of mine
2009-03-25T18:43:00.000Z	kitche	ActionParsnip	yes unless it's the options that no longer work though
