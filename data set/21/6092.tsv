2009-11-24T14:37:00.000Z	cornflake		hey, i'm trying to install ubuntu on my netbook while salvaging the windows partition
2009-11-24T14:37:00.000Z	cornflake		is it possible?
2009-11-24T14:37:00.000Z	Billiard	cornflake	its possible
2009-11-24T14:37:00.000Z	cornflake	Billiard	can it be done with the ubuntu installer?
2009-11-24T14:38:00.000Z	Billiard	cornflake	what do you want to do just have both windows and linux?
2009-11-24T14:38:00.000Z	cornflake	Billiard	yes. windows is already installed and has a 'ghost' partition in the back to reinstall windows too
2009-11-24T14:39:00.000Z	Billiard	cornflake	the ubuntu installer wont delete your windows paritions unless you tell it to do so
2009-11-24T14:40:00.000Z	cornflake	Billiard	so windows will only be deleted if i delete the partition?
2009-11-24T14:40:00.000Z	Billiard	cornflake	yes, but if you install ubuntus boot loader it will overwrite windows's bootloader by default
2009-11-24T14:40:00.000Z	cornflake	Billiard	 and not if i repartition a section of the drive?
2009-11-24T14:42:00.000Z	Billiard	cornflake	if you repartition and leave the windows partition and choose not to format it you wont lose it, is that what you are asking?
2009-11-24T14:42:00.000Z	cornflake	Billiard	yes
2009-11-24T14:44:00.000Z	cornflake	Billiard	well... i backed up everything beforehand so here goes nothing
2009-11-24T14:45:00.000Z	cornflake	Billiard	if i don't install the boot loader, how would add linux to the windows boot loader? (a howto would be nice)
2009-11-24T14:45:00.000Z	Billiard	cornflake	akaik you cant
2009-11-24T14:46:00.000Z	cornflake	Billiard	then i'll use the linux one then
2009-11-24T14:50:00.000Z	cornflake	Billiard	thanx. hopefully it all works. i'll find out in an hour or two
2009-11-24T14:50:00.000Z	Billiard	cornflake	alright
2009-11-24T15:00:00.000Z	cornflake	Billiard	sweet! the install worked better than i expected
2009-11-24T15:01:00.000Z	cornflake	Billiard	the bootloader automatically put windows as an option
2009-11-24T15:01:00.000Z	Billiard	cornflake	it should
