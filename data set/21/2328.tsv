2009-12-02T11:33:00.000Z	lovre	greezmunkey	no, this didnt help... Where can i see if i have a proxy set up for http?
2009-12-02T11:34:00.000Z	greezmunkey	lovre	what do you get when you type ip route in a terminal?

2009-12-02T11:36:00.000Z	greezmunkey	lovre	are you on a home network?
2009-12-02T11:36:00.000Z	lovre	greezmunkey	no, i am on a dorm network...
2009-12-02T11:36:00.000Z	lovre	greezmunkey	student dorm
2009-12-02T11:37:00.000Z	greezmunkey	lovre	looks like what you are trying to do is blocked than :(
2009-12-02T11:37:00.000Z	lovre	greezmunkey	no, it worked the other day, im just trying to do a regular update, like i allways do...
2009-12-02T11:38:00.000Z	greezmunkey	lovre	what have you tried that did work, http, https, ftp, etc...?
2009-12-02T11:39:00.000Z	lovre	greezmunkey	well, everything works fine, even http works, im surfing at the moment. Only when i try to update debs it acts weird. Its like it thinks it should connect to localhost instead of a remote server. I have a feeling like there is a proxy set somewhere, but i cant find where...
2009-12-02T11:40:00.000Z	greezmunkey	lovre	Check this: http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-1839.html
2009-12-02T11:41:00.000Z	greezmunkey	lovre	look at the first response to the question.
2009-12-02T11:42:00.000Z	lovre	greezmunkey	trying it out
2009-12-02T11:44:00.000Z	lovre	greezmunkey	hmm, this is weird. I just did 'apt-get upgrade' and it worked. Downloaded and upgraded, with no problems. I dont get it. Seems that its a problem that only effects KPackageKit...
2009-12-02T11:45:00.000Z	greezmunkey	lovre	that is wierd :/
2009-12-02T11:46:00.000Z	lovre	greezmunkey	hmm. do you know what happens when i select to use proxy in general system settings. What files are being modified? Maybe i can check them, maybe something else modified them..
2009-12-02T11:47:00.000Z	greezmunkey	lovre	I don't use a proxy, just a s*itload of iptables, so idk
2009-12-02T11:48:00.000Z	greezmunkey	lovre	google ubuntu proxy configuration, that should help.
2009-12-02T11:48:00.000Z	lovre	greezmunkey	will do
2009-12-02T11:52:00.000Z	lovre	greezmunkey	some hits, nothing usefull. Checked few files, no traces of proxy config... Im giving up for now, i will upgrade from console, and see if something comes up later on. Thank you for your time.
