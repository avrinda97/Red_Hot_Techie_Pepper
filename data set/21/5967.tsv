2007-07-27T09:56:00.000Z	nickrud	Zaibot	if you really have nothing in menu.lst, run sudo update-grub
2007-07-27T09:57:00.000Z	Zaibot	nickrud	"No GRUB directory found. To create a template run 'mkdir /boot/grub' first. To install grub, install it manually or try the 'grub-install' command. ### Warning, grub-install is used to change your MBR. ###@
2007-07-27T09:58:00.000Z	nickrud	Zaibot	sudo mkdir /boot/grub && sudo update-grub   and then take a look at /boot/grub/menu.lst.
2007-07-27T09:58:00.000Z	Zaibot	nickrud	If it is useful information Windows stopped working due to some hal.dll
2007-07-27T09:59:00.000Z	nickrud	Zaibot	what I don't know about windows would fill the ocean.
2007-07-27T10:04:00.000Z	nickrud	Zaibot	some good instructions for you: /usr/share/doc/grub/README.Debian.gz
2007-07-27T10:04:00.000Z	Zaibot	nickrud	and osxdude, my menu.lst is no longer empty. Thanks for your help, Ill be back soon if it isn't working ;)
2007-07-27T10:05:00.000Z	nickrud	Zaibot	one more thing
2007-07-27T10:05:00.000Z	nickrud	Zaibot	sudo grub-install "(hd0,0)"  to make sure your mbr is set right
2007-07-27T10:07:00.000Z	Zaibot	nickrud	I get this message: "Could not find device for /boot: Not found or not a block device."
2007-07-27T10:07:00.000Z	nickrud	Zaibot	do you have a separate boot partition?
2007-07-27T10:08:00.000Z	nickrud	Zaibot	stupid me:  sudo grub-install "(hd0)"
2007-07-27T10:08:00.000Z	Zaibot	nickrud	I don't think so
2007-07-27T10:08:00.000Z	Zaibot	nickrud	I got the same message
2007-07-27T10:10:00.000Z	Zaibot	nickrud	I made 3 partitions on the install; "/", "swap", "/boot"... Is that correct?
2007-07-27T10:11:00.000Z	nickrud	Zaibot	you do have a separate boot:  sudo grub-install --root-directory=/boot "(hd0)"
2007-07-27T10:13:00.000Z	Zaibot	nickrud	still same message, and I got error 22 when I did not use separate boot, too.
2007-07-27T10:14:00.000Z	nickrud	Zaibot	I am not a grub xpert, and we've reached my limit: creating a menu.lst and supposedly installing the mbr stuff. If you hang around, there are people who know that thing inside and out
2007-07-27T10:15:00.000Z	Zaibot	nickrud	Im gonna try to start Ubuntu now, otherwise I'll wait for someone.
2007-07-27T10:15:00.000Z	nickrud	Zaibot	luck
2007-07-27T10:33:00.000Z	Zaibot	nickrud	I still got the same error (error 22) :(
