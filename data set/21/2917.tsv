2009-09-11T13:06:00.000Z	lightpriest		is there an VDPAU like support for ATI cards?
2009-09-11T13:06:00.000Z	lightpriest		a*
2009-09-11T13:07:00.000Z	lightpriest		i got a weak proc that shows HD movies flawlessly only with VDPAU turned on
2009-09-11T13:07:00.000Z	lightpriest		there's no way to get that proc power of the GPU with ATI cards?
2009-09-11T13:09:00.000Z	lightpriest		!VDPAU
2009-09-11T13:10:00.000Z	ejv	lightpriest	I recommend coreavc
2009-09-11T13:10:00.000Z	lightpriest	ejv	what is that?
2009-09-11T13:11:00.000Z	lightpriest	ejv	that's a similar functionality to VDPAU?
2009-09-11T13:12:00.000Z	lightpriest	ejv	i guess i'll just have to try ;)
2009-09-11T13:13:00.000Z	lightpriest	ejv	i understand that.
2009-09-11T13:13:00.000Z	ejv	lightpriest	what video chipset are you using?
2009-09-11T13:16:00.000Z	ejv	lightpriest	with properly compiled libraries, you can squeeze 1080p bluray playback off an onboard ati HD3200. you need to know what you're doing.
2009-09-11T13:17:00.000Z	lightpriest	ejv	"properly compiled" sounds like years of work ;p
2009-09-11T13:17:00.000Z	lightpriest	ejv	anyhow... i'll try that...
2009-09-11T13:18:00.000Z	ejv	lightpriest	if you're not into that, I suggest your purchase a beefy card to make sure you don't have issues; keep in mind that even sufficiently powerful cards can falter playing hi-def content; it matters what libraries your players use.
2009-09-11T13:19:00.000Z	lightpriest	ejv	yeah :/ well, thanks...
2009-09-11T13:20:00.000Z	ejv	lightpriest	for example, my 8800gts, a sufficiently powerful card, can not playback 1080p bluray in VLC, because of inefficiencies within VLC.
2009-09-11T13:21:00.000Z	ejv	lightpriest	VLC uses libraries from the ffmpeg project. the h.264 codec in ffmpeg is part of libavcodec, which is terrible; coreavc is a windows proprietary decoder, however happens to be tremendously more efficient than libavcodec.
2009-09-11T13:22:00.000Z	ejv	lightpriest	my solution to make my 8800gts playback 1080p flawlessly, was mplayer + coreavc; if you really jump in, I suggest grabbing the recent build via their SVN. ;)
2009-09-11T13:22:00.000Z	lightpriest	ejv	thanks :)
2009-09-11T13:23:00.000Z	ejv	lightpriest	i've seen a low end dual core amd 4850e and a onboard hd3200 playback 1080p, I hope that gives you hope ;)
