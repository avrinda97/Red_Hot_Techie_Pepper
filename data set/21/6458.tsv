2007-03-28T05:14:00.000Z	jatt	slide_	why don't you download it from the archives.
2007-03-28T05:15:00.000Z	slide_	jatt	i cant find the archive from packages.ubuntu.org.cn!
2007-03-28T05:15:00.000Z	jatt	slide_	easy: use another mirror
2007-03-28T05:15:00.000Z	slide_	jatt	where can i find it
2007-03-28T05:15:00.000Z	jatt	slide_	see the ubuntu home page for mirrors
2007-03-28T05:17:00.000Z	slide_	jatt	i did but the keywords inserted doesnt give any valid packages!
2007-03-28T05:20:00.000Z	slide_	jatt	i cant believe that anybody could send me this fucking, stupid, damn, file!
2007-03-28T05:21:00.000Z	jatt	slide_	you mentioned you wanted that file to do something in Debian, so probably you are doing something wrong. BTW, the file is available in the archives.
2007-03-28T05:21:00.000Z	slide_	jatt	right, can u give me the exact URL!
2007-03-28T05:23:00.000Z	jatt	slide_	you are being rude, but anyway I will put here the URL for you:
2007-03-28T05:25:00.000Z	slide_	jatt	thanx man....it's possible that this may caused by the web coockies dropout
2007-03-28T05:26:00.000Z	slide_	jatt	mmmhhh... no! i searched it on packages.ubuntu.com.cn !
2007-03-28T05:29:00.000Z	jatt	slide_	why do you insist to use packages.ubuntu.com.cn? Are you obligated by your government? I am sorry, but I told you alredy many times to use another mirror.
2007-03-28T05:29:00.000Z	jatt	slide_	the package containing the library you are looking for is in the archives. Download it and install the file.
2007-03-28T05:30:00.000Z	slide_	jatt	i never used ubuntu. i thought that URL was the official parent mirror
2007-03-28T05:30:00.000Z	jatt	slide_	it could be the mirror is not up-to-date yet official
2007-03-28T05:30:00.000Z	slide_	jatt	i just decompressed it thanx
