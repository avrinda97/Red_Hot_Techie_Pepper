2010-04-05T20:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	acicula	 so you mean to sayits an 'easter egg' in gnome?
2010-05-02T15:55:00.000Z	acicula	Dr_Willis	it uses gdm yeah
2010-05-02T20:40:00.000Z	acicula	Dr_Willis	be carefull with that though, there is no guarantee running exe's in wine will not harm your system
2010-05-02T20:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	acicula	 ive ran malware/virus things in wine befor to just see what they are doing :)
2010-05-02T20:41:00.000Z	acicula	Dr_Willis	as long as you are aware of the fact that its not a sandbox
2010-05-09T10:37:00.000Z	acicula	Dr_Willis	that is available sooner then you might think
2010-05-09T10:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	acicula	 ive heard promises of it.. but not seen it actually happen yet.
2010-05-09T10:37:00.000Z	acicula	Dr_Willis	what is lacking is iommu
2010-05-09T10:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	acicula	 last i 'heard' some 3d acell was being worked on that worked on some specific chipsets, in some specific video 'modes'  in some specific games.... but ive never managed to get all teh voodoo workeing
2010-05-09T10:40:00.000Z	acicula	Dr_Willis	without iommu you'd have to have extra code do the translation between vm <->gpu
2010-10-04T18:35:00.000Z	acicula	Dr_Willis	lies :( i have never seen bandwith on 3g connections :/
