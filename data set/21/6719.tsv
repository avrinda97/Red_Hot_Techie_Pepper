2007-07-11T09:53:00.000Z	Spark		i don't see why i don't have any ide devices in /dev
2007-07-11T09:53:00.000Z	Spark		it's ridiculous
2007-07-11T09:54:00.000Z	Spark		what the fuck, sda1 is the new hda1?
2007-07-11T09:55:00.000Z	Spark		couldn't they have waited for a major version to break compatibility
2007-07-11T09:55:00.000Z	Spark		i despair sometimes
2007-07-11T09:56:00.000Z	Spark		or just keep the old names around to allow an upgrade path
2007-07-11T09:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Spark	That is one of the reasons that they use UUID's now :)
2007-07-11T09:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Spark	Dist-upgraded as in through update-manager?
2007-07-11T09:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Spark	That is not the correct way to upgrade
2007-07-11T09:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Spark	And is likely why things are broken
2007-07-11T10:01:00.000Z	Spark	Jordan_U	i very much doubt using this gnome thing would have prevented the kernel from no-longer providing /dev/hda
2007-07-11T10:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Spark	I think that you are wrong
2007-07-11T10:01:00.000Z	Spark	Jordan_U	why do you think that
2007-07-11T10:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Spark	I was switched to using UUID's when I upgraded
2007-07-11T10:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Spark	It is *not* just a GUI front end for apt-get dist-upgrade
2007-07-11T10:04:00.000Z	Spark	Jordan_U	why invent a gui tool when there are already command-line tools for the task?
2007-07-11T10:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Spark	Because it does *more* than apt-get dist-upgrade does, there is also a cli version for servers
2007-07-11T10:04:00.000Z	Spark	Jordan_U	what does it do more?
2007-07-11T10:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Spark	Switch to UUID's for one :)
2007-07-11T10:04:00.000Z	Spark	Jordan_U	i'm sure all it needs to do can be done in a script
2007-07-11T10:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Spark	I am sure also, what is the difference between a script and a program?
