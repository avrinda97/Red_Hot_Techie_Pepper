2006-04-15T07:03:00.000Z	nuzzy		linuxlover...you could always grab the .deb file here: http://lineak.sourceforge.net/index.php?nav=download
2006-04-15T07:05:00.000Z	nuzzy		there's a .deb file there for lineakconfig
2006-04-15T07:07:00.000Z	linuxlover	nuzzy	That's where I keep getting this error message from..
2006-04-15T06:56:00.000Z	linuxlover	nuzzy	....Ayup... ;)
2006-04-15T06:56:00.000Z	nuzzy	linuxlover	 Try installing automake1.9
2006-04-15T06:58:00.000Z	linuxlover	nuzzy	So after running "sudo apt-get install automake1.9" do I re ./configure or try "make" again?
2006-04-15T06:58:00.000Z	linuxlover	nuzzy	I'm not familiar with automake
2006-04-15T07:04:00.000Z	linuxlover	nuzzy	I have lineak installed.  And now I'm trying to get the GUI file configurer running (lineakconfig)..What's the file that link sends to?
2006-04-15T07:04:00.000Z	linuxlover	nuzzy	A dependency?
2006-04-15T07:07:00.000Z	linuxlover	nuzzy	I have lineakconifig already.  Extracted and configured, but now I need to run "make"
2006-04-15T07:08:00.000Z	linuxlover	nuzzy	Will the contents of the .deb be different than the tar.gz?  More catered to ubuntu?
2006-04-15T07:11:00.000Z	linuxlover	nuzzy	Was message run "sudo dpkg -i filename.deb" to me?
2006-04-15T07:12:00.000Z	linuxlover	nuzzy	File is not there.
2006-04-15T07:13:00.000Z	nuzzy	linuxlover	 lemme check
2006-04-15T07:14:00.000Z	linuxlover	nuzzy	cpare I've tried...It was kind of messy and unless you know how to config your ports..I had problems.
2006-04-15T07:17:00.000Z	linuxlover	nuzzy	No dice, huh?
2006-04-15T07:20:00.000Z	linuxlover	nuzzy	Sweet.  How're you doing that? ;)
2006-04-15T07:20:00.000Z	nuzzy	linuxlover	 turn on DCC ssend
2006-04-15T07:21:00.000Z	linuxlover	nuzzy	I have no idea how to accomplish that.  Or even what it is.  (I'm highly n00b)
2006-04-15T07:22:00.000Z	nuzzy	linuxlover	 grab it like this then: http://kent.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/lineak/lineakconfig_0.3.2-1_i386.deb
2006-04-15T07:23:00.000Z	linuxlover	nuzzy	Sweet.  But what is dcc send?
