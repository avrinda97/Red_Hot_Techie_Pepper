2005-09-24T10:19:00.000Z	BlueEagle	shorty114	sudo aptitude install xfce4, but yes.
2005-09-24T10:20:00.000Z	BlueEagle	shorty114	what time is it?
2005-09-24T10:20:00.000Z	shorty114	BlueEagle	uh, 9:20 pm?
2005-09-24T10:21:00.000Z	BlueEagle	shorty114	Well, get your evenin' meal done and go to sleep. It might be done when you wake up. :p
2005-09-24T10:21:00.000Z	BlueEagle	shorty114	it needs it and it will install it.
2005-09-24T10:21:00.000Z	BlueEagle	shorty114	might not configure it for you though...
2005-09-24T10:22:00.000Z	shorty114	BlueEagle	xorg?
2005-09-24T10:22:00.000Z	BlueEagle	shorty114	yes.
2005-09-24T10:22:00.000Z	BlueEagle	shorty114	if you've got gnome then you've got xorg.
2005-09-24T10:22:00.000Z	BlueEagle	shorty114	thus it won't install it or touch your xorg.conf
2005-09-24T10:23:00.000Z	shorty114	BlueEagle	i know, i was talking to geez
2005-09-24T10:23:00.000Z	BlueEagle	shorty114	Then you might want to prefix with geez:  hehe
2005-09-24T10:24:00.000Z	BlueEagle	shorty114	That's what happens when people use nicks that look like d00d sp34k for jees :p
2005-09-24T10:25:00.000Z	BlueEagle	shorty114	geez, c'mon. :p
2005-09-24T10:25:00.000Z	BlueEagle	shorty114	You might need to restart the X-server with CTRL+ALT+BackSpace before it appears in gdm
