2007-12-09T01:45:00.000Z	nomic		ok
2007-12-09T01:45:00.000Z	PirateHead	nomic	Do other sounds work?
2007-12-09T01:45:00.000Z	PirateHead	nomic	Does YouTube play?
2007-12-09T01:45:00.000Z	PirateHead	nomic	With sound, that is?
2007-12-09T01:46:00.000Z	PirateHead	nomic	It's installed by default.
2007-12-09T01:47:00.000Z	PirateHead	nomic	Totem is a front-end to gstreamer, which is also installed by default.
2007-12-09T01:47:00.000Z	PirateHead	nomic	Okay, flash probably isn't your problem then.
2007-12-09T01:48:00.000Z	PirateHead	nomic	However, the video you're trying to watch on silverscreen isn't a flash video.
2007-12-09T01:48:00.000Z	PirateHead	nomic	on the SilverScreen site, right click the movie and hit Open in Movie Player
2007-12-09T01:49:00.000Z	PirateHead	nomic	In that case, right click the movie in the web page and click Open with "Movie Player"
2007-12-09T01:50:00.000Z	PirateHead	nomic	Hmm... that's strange. Are you using Gutsy?
2007-12-09T01:51:00.000Z	PirateHead	nomic	What is in the right click menu?
2007-12-09T01:52:00.000Z	PirateHead	nomic	What options are available?
2007-12-09T01:52:00.000Z	PirateHead	nomic	Like, more than two or three?
2007-12-09T01:52:00.000Z	PirateHead	nomic	For me it's got Open with "Movie Player", Copy, Fullscreen, and About. Do you have those?
2007-12-09T01:53:00.000Z	PirateHead	nomic	How about any of the others?
2007-12-09T01:56:00.000Z	PirateHead	nomic	I'm not sure, but I would start by searching for divx in synaptic.
2007-12-09T01:57:00.000Z	PirateHead	nomic	Or search in add/remove programs.
