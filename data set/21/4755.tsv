2008-02-21T18:42:00.000Z	davmonster		hey
2008-02-21T18:43:00.000Z	davmonster		what're the best ubuntu books out at the moment?
2008-02-21T18:44:00.000Z	davmonster		is that part of the LPI course?
2008-02-21T18:46:00.000Z	macogw	davmonster	is what part of LPI?
2008-02-21T18:46:00.000Z	macogw	davmonster	/etc/fstab?
2008-02-21T18:47:00.000Z	macogw	davmonster	the ubuntu specific exams are only for after youve already taken the first 1 maybe 2 levels of LPI
2008-02-21T18:48:00.000Z	macogw	davmonster	the ubuntu training things that recently were released are more on teh beginner side
2008-02-21T18:49:00.000Z	macogw	davmonster	at least, i think they are...it said a bunch of stuff in the intro about using it in a classroom
2008-02-21T18:50:00.000Z	davmonster	macogw	do you know which would be some good books in order to train for the ubuntu-specific stuff?
2008-02-21T18:51:00.000Z	macogw	davmonster	good luck.  they need to revise it.  who worries about IRQs on a 2.6 kernel?  and who cares about winmodems?  why are you using dialup on your server?
2008-02-21T18:51:00.000Z	macogw	davmonster	nope
2008-02-21T18:51:00.000Z	macogw	davmonster	i havent been studying bookishly.  i prefer hands-on
2008-02-21T18:53:00.000Z	macogw	davmonster	i did a few onliine courses from my ACM membership as a bit of study, but just using linux teaches you a lot.  im taking a system administration class this semester and based entirely on spending too much time on this channel and ubuntuforums, its a very very easy class for me...and very hard for all the kids who took the pre-requisite (not me) and are in a high enough year in school to take the class (not me)
2008-02-21T18:54:00.000Z	davmonster	macogw	at least, I hope it will :)
2008-02-21T18:54:00.000Z	davmonster	macogw	I'm just looking for good linux books so that HR can buy them for me :)
2008-02-21T18:55:00.000Z	macogw	davmonster	the hardest part will *definitely* be the stuff about outdated hardware that causes trouble on outdated kernels that nobody uses anymore and that you therefore would get *no* real-world experience with unless you just like trying to install 10 year old releases for fun
2008-02-21T18:58:00.000Z	macogw	davmonster	if i have a spare $300 sitting around at the end of the semester ill take it.  i figure getting the cert is the only way to get around the HR jerks who say "only 2 years experience with linux? we asked for 7!" and dont get that 7 years of playing around with it for 15 minutes a week v. using it for *everything* for 2 years...the immersion's going to help, and being a fast learner can never be looked at as a *bad* quality, right?
2008-02-21T19:00:00.000Z	davmonster	macogw	I agree..
2008-02-21T19:02:00.000Z	macogw	davmonster	UNIX in a Nutshell
2008-02-21T19:02:00.000Z	macogw	davmonster	Linux Administration Handbook
2008-02-21T19:02:00.000Z	macogw	davmonster	those two are "textbooks" for my class
