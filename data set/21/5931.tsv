2008-05-19T23:42:00.000Z	bullium	psych	does it run ok if wpa sup is loaded after gnome?
2008-05-19T23:43:00.000Z	psych	bullium	it does, ive it setted to auto
2008-05-19T23:44:00.000Z	psych	bullium	when gnome starts form the first time, it works perfectly
2008-05-19T23:44:00.000Z	psych	bullium	same problem using kdm or gdm... and kde, xfce dont have this problem as well
2008-05-19T23:45:00.000Z	bullium	psych	so it loads fine if the system was powered off...but if you logoff you experience the problem
2008-05-19T23:45:00.000Z	psych	bullium	right, and if i kill wpa_supplicant before restart X, it loads ok too
2008-05-19T23:46:00.000Z	bullium	psych	sounds like you need to have a mechanism in place to stop wpasup everytime you press the logoff button
2008-05-19T23:49:00.000Z	psych	bullium	is there a way to set a command when press crtl+alt+backspace
2008-05-19T23:51:00.000Z	psych	bullium	ideas?
2008-05-19T23:52:00.000Z	bullium	psych	I'll have to figure out what exactly happens when you logoff and on...give me a minute
2008-05-19T23:52:00.000Z	psych	bullium	ok sure, ty
2008-05-20T00:10:00.000Z	bullium	psych	still here?
2008-05-20T00:10:00.000Z	psych	bullium	yes
2008-05-20T00:11:00.000Z	bullium		there maybe a way to run a command or script when you log off. do you understand bash scripting
2008-05-20T00:11:00.000Z	bullium	psych	there maybe a way to run a command or script when you log off. do you understand bash scripting
2008-05-20T00:12:00.000Z	psych	bullium	im not a master, but i can create some bash scripts, yeah
2008-05-20T00:13:00.000Z	bullium	psych	from what I've read you can add to a script "/etc/gdm/PostSession/Default" and it executes when you logoff or restart

2008-05-20T00:15:00.000Z	psych	bullium	really good man, ty, its not a gnome fix, but yeah my system fix :)
