2008-11-25T13:43:00.000Z	|TJ|		how do i figure out my ip through terminal
2008-11-25T13:45:00.000Z	|TJ|		How to i make my computer to where someone can SSH into it
2008-11-25T13:46:00.000Z	|TJ|		!ssh
2008-11-25T13:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	|TJ|	sudo apt-get install openssh-server
2008-11-25T13:46:00.000Z	|TJ|	ActionParsnip1	does it config itself?
2008-11-25T13:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	|TJ|	you will be able to logon with the accounts on the system you are ssh-ing to
2008-11-25T13:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	|TJ|	X forwarding is also enabled by default :D
2008-11-25T13:48:00.000Z	|TJ|	ActionParsnip1	now i need my IP address i do ifconfig and it give me 127.0.0.1
2008-11-25T13:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	|TJ|	then thats not SSH. thats your network configuration
2008-11-25T13:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	|TJ|	how about the output of ifconfig eth0
2008-11-25T13:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	|TJ|	can you provide a pastebin if the entire output of ifconfig please
2008-11-25T13:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	|TJ|	ok well eth1 has a valid IP address
2008-11-25T13:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	|TJ|	lo is the one you were detailing with 127.0.0.1
2008-11-25T13:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	|TJ|	this is standard
2008-11-25T14:08:00.000Z	|TJ|	ActionParsnip1	i added port fwding to my router and im still getting connection refused
2008-11-25T14:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	|TJ|	then you arent doing the forwarding right
2008-11-25T14:09:00.000Z	|TJ|	ActionParsnip1	i fwd port 22 on ip 192.168.0.2
2008-11-25T14:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	|TJ|	you may want to put the system running the ssh server on static ip, saves heartache later if its ip changes due to expired dhcp lease
2008-11-25T14:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	|TJ|	read the manual for your router, maybe theres a step you are missing or maybe the router needs rebooting to apply
2008-11-25T14:10:00.000Z	|TJ|	ActionParsnip1	my ip never changes i just dont remember it...
2008-11-25T14:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	|TJ|	im on about your systems IP not your routers
