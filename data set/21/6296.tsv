2007-05-24T08:39:00.000Z	agentnewb	SurfnKid	what your problem with swap?
2007-05-24T08:40:00.000Z	SurfnKid	agentnewb	i dont want swap, but my menus dont paint correctly
2007-05-24T08:42:00.000Z	agentnewb	SurfnKid	swap is very much useful if configured right. You can turn down how often it uses it and optimize your hard drive with hdparm.
2007-05-24T08:42:00.000Z	SurfnKid	agentnewb	awesome.... got any tips on hdparm
2007-05-24T08:44:00.000Z	agentnewb	SurfnKid	sure just let me grab the link

2007-05-24T08:48:00.000Z	SurfnKid	agentnewb	thx
2007-05-24T09:29:00.000Z	SurfnKid	agentnewb	question on the tty thing on that linuxjournal site, I tried editing file /etc/inittab
2007-05-24T09:30:00.000Z	agentnewb	SurfnKid	yep I came into same conclusion. Turns out ubuntu uses a faster boot method and you might want to try out sysv-rc-conf as well as checking .config in your home directory
2007-05-24T09:30:00.000Z	agentnewb	SurfnKid	no clue yet as to how to turn off the extra tty
2007-05-24T09:31:00.000Z	SurfnKid	agentnewb	really? no clue yet on ubuntu?
2007-05-24T09:31:00.000Z	SurfnKid	agentnewb	I thought it'd be discovered by now :P
2007-05-24T09:31:00.000Z	agentnewb	SurfnKid	I've been busy setting up beryl and getting wireless going with this other box
2007-05-24T09:32:00.000Z	SurfnKid	agentnewb	cool, miniPCI ?
2007-05-24T09:32:00.000Z	agentnewb	SurfnKid	yeah
2007-05-24T09:33:00.000Z	agentnewb	SurfnKid	been getting into the whole embedded linux thing with my linksys router got dd-wrt so sort of not keeping up to pace, try checking into something called system V
2007-05-24T09:33:00.000Z	SurfnKid	agentnewb	im using the bcm4306, what are u using
2007-05-24T09:33:00.000Z	agentnewb	SurfnKid	TheSheep over in xubuntu might be able to explain more about tweaking ubuntu but I didn't understood what he was saying about boot up methods
2007-05-24T09:33:00.000Z	SurfnKid	agentnewb	cool never heard of it
2007-05-24T09:33:00.000Z	SurfnKid	agentnewb	ok cool
