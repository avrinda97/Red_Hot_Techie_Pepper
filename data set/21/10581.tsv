2005-08-06T09:03:00.000Z	s0cks		Is there a program I could use to reformat this NTFS partition without losing ANY of the data contained within? All I wish to do is shrink the partition.
2005-08-06T09:03:00.000Z	cafuego	s0cks	reformatting *equals* deleting all data
2005-08-06T09:03:00.000Z	s0cks	cafuego	: Well then, can I SHRINK the partition?
2005-08-06T09:03:00.000Z	cafuego	s0cks	Yep. First, run a disk check; degrag; run a disk check. Then you can use 'parted' to resize
2005-08-06T09:04:00.000Z	s0cks	cafuego	: Problem.
2005-08-06T09:04:00.000Z	s0cks	cafuego	: I'm RUNNING windows on a 150 gig partition. I need to run Windows on a 110 gig partition.
2005-08-06T09:04:00.000Z	s0cks	cafuego	: Can I do it through windows?
2005-08-06T09:04:00.000Z	cafuego	s0cks	Yes. Just checka dn defrag it (from within windows) and then resize from the Ubuntu CD.
2005-08-06T09:05:00.000Z	cafuego	s0cks	There is no implied or other warranry on that resize operation.
2005-08-06T09:05:00.000Z	cafuego	s0cks	it *may* destroy all your data.
2005-08-06T09:05:00.000Z	s0cks	cafuego	: FUCK!
2005-08-06T09:06:00.000Z	cafuego	s0cks	If you can risk that, disks are cheep.
2005-08-06T09:06:00.000Z	s0cks	cafuego	: My main problem with it is that I need all this data for my job.
2005-08-06T09:06:00.000Z	cafuego	s0cks	Just get a new hdd then
2005-08-06T09:07:00.000Z	s0cks	cafuego	: Can you send 50 bucks to my paypal account?
2005-08-06T09:07:00.000Z	cafuego	s0cks	Why would I do that? *YOU* have a job!
2005-08-06T09:07:00.000Z	s0cks	cafuego	: Because I had to spend 3000 dollars on my car in the last month?
2005-08-06T09:08:00.000Z	cafuego	s0cks	Dude, if it costs that much to maintain, get a new car too.
2005-08-06T09:09:00.000Z	s0cks	cafuego	: Kiss my ass. Buy me a hard drive, and I'll get a new car.
2005-08-06T09:09:00.000Z	cafuego	s0cks	if you _can't_ lose that data, you'll need a new HD. No amount of getting angry with _me_ is going to change that.
2005-08-06T09:10:00.000Z	cafuego	s0cks	You're more than werlcome to risk a resize and I'm sure it works fine in 98 out of 100 cases. Just be warned it *may* fail.
