2005-10-22T11:18:00.000Z	signius		Im also stuck with ubuntu refusing to start with eth2 by default it insists on starting eth1 no matter what the fuck i tell it to do the card starts but i have to manually active that card upon boot up with although its a pain it wouldne be a problem normally apart from added inconvience....However becuase its not activating eth2 on boot up its also not creating /proc/drivers/aironet/eths2 which has the added the effect that i cannot use an
2005-10-22T11:20:00.000Z	piedamaro	signius	look at/etc/network/interfaces
2005-10-22T11:20:00.000Z	signius		yeah i been in there and everything is correct
2005-10-22T11:21:00.000Z	signius	piedamaro	if i comment out eth1 then eth1 doesnt activate on boot up however niether does eth2 and eth2 is set to auto eth2 in /etc/network/interfaces
2005-10-22T11:21:00.000Z	piedamaro		signus, I have this for my eth0: iface eth0 inet dhcp
2005-10-22T11:22:00.000Z	signius	piedamaro	eth1 and eth2 are on the same physical with a cisco but becuase the aironet 350 has 2 external antenna connector its sees 2 cards even tho physically there is only 1
2005-10-22T11:24:00.000Z	piedamaro	signius	ok, are u sure it's eth1 and eth2 and not eth1 and eth1:1 ? (subinterface)
2005-10-22T11:25:00.000Z	signius	piedamaro	yes because when i manually acvtivate he card everything works and all the WEP DHCP etc thats configured on eth2 works but the same is not true is just configure eth1 also when you go into /proc/drivers/aironet/ there is only a /eth1 not any ohter variations
2005-10-22T11:26:00.000Z	signius		this is stopping me using anything like kismet and etherreal or anything using RFMON and it needs /proc/drivers/aironet/eth2 and this is not being created
2005-10-22T11:29:00.000Z	piedamaro	signius	you're right, then it could be that on boot it tries to bring the ifaces up when there is no 'airo' module loaded
2005-10-22T11:29:00.000Z	signius		java is completely broke on most systems its the biigest load of unreliable incompatible crap going IMHO it doesnt matter what platform its on
2005-10-22T11:30:00.000Z	signius		yeah i concur i think this is a module issue but i an still pretty new to Linux and i do not know much about how to resilve issues in that area
2005-10-22T11:30:00.000Z	piedamaro	signius	so running 'modprobe airo' earlier at boot could solve the problem
2005-10-22T11:31:00.000Z	signius	piedamaro	if i fire up the laptop thats having this issue can you give me a bit of hand holding to try and resolve this ?
2005-10-22T11:32:00.000Z	piedamaro	signius	ok, but it seems I can't do direct chat, let's try...
2005-10-22T11:33:00.000Z	signius		How do you mean direct chat ?
