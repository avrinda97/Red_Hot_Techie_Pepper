2011-04-02T06:15:00.000Z	mneptok	nicofs	where did you get this ARM port of Ubuntu?
2011-04-02T06:15:00.000Z	nicofs	mneptok	ac100.gudinna.com
2011-04-02T06:16:00.000Z	mneptok	nicofs	hardly a supported release.
2011-04-02T06:17:00.000Z	nicofs	mneptok	but shouldnt that gamma thing be a generic error?
2011-04-02T06:18:00.000Z	mneptok	nicofs	if you go and buy a car from a person on the street, the manufacturer is NOT going to warrantee it. same applies here.
2011-04-02T06:18:00.000Z	mneptok	nicofs	ARM is not a supported Ubuntu port. thus, discussions of issues with it is offtopic for this channel.
2011-04-02T06:18:00.000Z	nicofs	mneptok	anyway - if that problem isnt tackled, it won't get solved and never be part of any supported release - and car manufacturers don't sell open-source cars
2011-04-02T06:18:00.000Z	mneptok	nicofs	again, ARM is not an officially supported platform
2011-04-02T06:19:00.000Z	nicofs	mneptok	and there are official efforts from ubuntu to support arm...
2011-04-02T06:19:00.000Z	mneptok	nicofs	yes, and when they are complete ARM questions will be welcome in this channel.
2011-04-02T06:20:00.000Z	nicofs	mneptok	if i had no arm and the same error, what would be your approach to the problem?
2011-04-02T06:21:00.000Z	mneptok	nicofs	we do not deal in theoriticals. for now, ARM questions are offtopic in this channel.
2011-04-02T06:23:00.000Z	nicofs	mneptok	so i'm not even allowed to try to get help here?
2011-04-02T06:23:00.000Z	mneptok	nicofs	for unsupported platforms? no, you are not.
2011-04-02T06:25:00.000Z	mneptok	nicofs	what is the output of "lspci | grep VGA" ?
2011-04-02T06:26:00.000Z	nicofs	mneptok	lspci: Cannot find any working access method.
2011-04-02T06:26:00.000Z	mneptok	nicofs	"uname -a"
2011-04-02T06:27:00.000Z	nicofs	mneptok	"Linux wb201244-ARM 2.6.29-arm2-ac100 #1 SMP PREEMPT Mon Oct 11 12:31:40 CEST 2010 armv7l GNU/Linux"
2011-04-02T06:28:00.000Z	mneptok	nicofs	was i not clear when i told you not to ask ARM-related questions here?
2011-04-02T06:29:00.000Z	nicofs	mneptok	in how far is asking about how to enter gamma values in xrandr specific to the processor i use?
2011-04-02T06:29:00.000Z	mneptok	nicofs	game over
