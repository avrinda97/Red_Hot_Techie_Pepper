2012-02-20T15:31:00.000Z	RobinJ1995		Hi. I've got a bit of a problem here... When I enter my password in LightDM and press enter the screen just flickers and goed straight back to LightDM
2012-02-20T15:33:00.000Z	RobinJ1995		I think I might have removed a wron package or something >.< Yesterday I had a dependency hell while trying to install Unity 5.4. In installed the version from the normal repo's again but I might have forgotten to install a few packages. When I run startx manually from tty1 I just get a black background and a white cursor.
2012-02-20T15:34:00.000Z	RobinJ1995		Could anyone help me with my somewhat extremely frustrating problem..?
2012-02-20T15:35:00.000Z	aBound	RobinJ1995	We can't help ya if we don't know the problem.
2012-02-20T15:36:00.000Z	aBound	RobinJ1995	Unity 5.4 isn't part of the official repository for Ubuntu 11.10 and older.
2012-02-20T15:37:00.000Z	RobinJ1995	aBound	i know... i just said i reinstalled the one from the normal repo's (4.x). But i might have forgotten to install some packages again :s
2012-02-20T15:41:00.000Z	RobinJ1995	aBound	they arent broken anymore.... because i installed the older ones again... i just think i forgot to install some vital package which causes lightdm to not being able to launch a unity session
2012-02-20T15:42:00.000Z	aBound	RobinJ1995	Are you able to install another GUI such as gnome-shell from a terminal?
2012-02-20T15:42:00.000Z	RobinJ1995	aBound	i can chroot into the system.... but do i have to install a lot of bloat? xD
2012-02-20T15:48:00.000Z	aBound	RobinJ1995	I would say if you were logged into gnome-shell you can check Synaptic.
2012-02-20T15:53:00.000Z	RobinJ1995	aBound	this is my lightdm log:
2012-02-20T15:55:00.000Z	RobinJ1995	aBound	yeah but that shpws up in EVERY xorg lol and the problem only happened today
2012-02-20T15:56:00.000Z	aBound	RobinJ1995	Are you able to boot into any other GUI or window manager besides Unity?
2012-02-20T15:56:00.000Z	RobinJ1995	aBound	dunno havent got any :p
2012-02-20T15:57:00.000Z	aBound	RobinJ1995	Figures if you can't boot into any other GUI or window manager it might actually be missing an nVidia driver.
2012-02-20T16:05:00.000Z	RobinJ1995	aBound	but i saw something interesting in lightdm, which confirms my suspicions
2012-02-20T16:05:00.000Z	aBound	RobinJ1995	I seen these two links: http://askubuntu.com/questions/66370/x11-doesnt-start-after-clean-11-10-install-dell-e6500-nvidia-8gb-ram-i386 and http://askubuntu.com/questions/90915/troubleshooting-x-server-ee-failed-to-load-module-nv-module-does-not-exist
2012-02-20T16:09:00.000Z	aBound	RobinJ1995	What happened when you tried the suggestion from that forum?
2012-02-20T16:10:00.000Z	RobinJ1995	aBound	i got into a new dependency hell :D
2012-02-20T16:16:00.000Z	aBound	RobinJ1995	Open a terminal and type: cat /usr/share/xsessions
2012-02-20T16:17:00.000Z	aBound	RobinJ1995	Oops I meant to type: ls /usr/share/xsessions
