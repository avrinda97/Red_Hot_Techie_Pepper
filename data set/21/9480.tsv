2008-03-13T08:10:00.000Z	ninja		seriously thats my only hope huh?
2008-03-13T08:10:00.000Z	ninja		i dont want to downgrade to an older ubuntu, i just want the updates off
2008-03-13T08:11:00.000Z	ninja		the updates killed my sound, so i figure that would fix it

2008-03-13T08:12:00.000Z	ninja		like i give a fuck if anyone cares lol, someone might
2008-03-13T08:12:00.000Z	Flannel	ninja	Hardy is alpha software.  #ubuntu+1 is the place for Hardy support, thanks.
2008-03-13T08:14:00.000Z	Flannel	ninja	Why are you running Hardy?
2008-03-13T08:15:00.000Z	Flannel	ninja	Right, but why not use the stable version? Ubuntu 7.10.  Hardy isn't fit for human consumption yet
2008-03-13T08:16:00.000Z	Flannel	ninja	What wouldn't work with the install of 7.10?
2008-03-13T08:18:00.000Z	Flannel	ninja	The most recent hardy updates broke (for pretty much everyone) : http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=722886
2008-03-13T08:23:00.000Z	Flannel	ninja	HARDY is offtopic in this channel.  We've explained how to get into the correct channel a number of times.
2008-03-13T08:24:00.000Z	Flannel	ninja	No.  Because the issues thats wrong with hardy right now breaks everythign.
2008-03-13T08:24:00.000Z	Flannel	ninja	We'd really like to see you install 7.10.  We can help you installing that if you'd like.
2008-03-13T08:26:00.000Z	Flannel	ninja	What doesn't work about it?
2008-03-13T08:27:00.000Z	Flannel	ninja	You broke your entire system with the update (on hardy) plain and simple.  Everyone who updated did.  There's not a whole lot we can do for you.
2008-03-13T08:27:00.000Z	Flannel	ninja	there are a whole bunch of people with the problem who are actually IN #ubuntu+1, and you may be able to get help there.
2008-03-13T08:28:00.000Z	Flannel	ninja	You need the # infront of it
2008-03-13T08:29:00.000Z	Flannel	ninja	/join #ubuntu+1
2008-03-13T08:29:00.000Z	Flannel	ninja	What doesn't work as far as the 7.04 (preferrably 7.10) install goes?
2008-03-13T08:34:00.000Z	Flannel	ninja	We've told you.  Yes, lots of people do.  They're all in the proper channel talking about it, and working through it right now, without you.
