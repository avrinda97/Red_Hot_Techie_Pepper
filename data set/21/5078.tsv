2008-12-15T02:12:00.000Z	whuffor		How do I know which version of amarok will be installed if I do sudo apt-get install amarok ? I'd like to install amarok2 if possible in ubuntu 8.10
2008-12-15T02:13:00.000Z	raylu	whuffor	aptitude show amarok
2008-12-15T02:13:00.000Z	raylu	whuffor	http://www.kubuntu.org/news/amarok-2.0
2008-12-15T02:14:00.000Z	whuffor	raylu	Thanks. aptitude show amarok gives: version 2:1.4.10-0ubuntu3, but isn't that the version number of the package?
2008-12-15T02:15:00.000Z	raylu	whuffor	the version # of the package is the version that will be installed
2008-12-15T02:15:00.000Z	whuffor	raylu	But amarok just released 2.0. I doubt very much that they are up to version 2.1.something already
2008-12-15T02:16:00.000Z	raylu	whuffor	um, it's version 1.4.10...
2008-12-15T02:17:00.000Z	whuffor	raylu	Oh. Then I don't want that package... Any idea if it's possible to install version 2.0 somehow?
2008-12-15T02:17:00.000Z	raylu	whuffor	yes, scroll up and see the two links we gave you
2008-12-15T02:22:00.000Z	whuffor	raylu	That link talks about installing on kubuntu. I don't see that it applies to ubuntu in that it talks about adept updater and stuff like that
2008-12-15T02:22:00.000Z	raylu	whuffor	er, as long as you add the right repositories, it'll install on ubuntu
2008-12-15T02:22:00.000Z	raylu	whuffor	the only difference is you'll have to pull in some qt packages that ubuntu doesn't come with
2008-12-15T02:23:00.000Z	whuffor	raylu	Yes, but I still don't understand how I tell apt, aptitude or whatever to install 2.0 instead of 1.4 after having added that line to the repository
2008-12-15T02:24:00.000Z	raylu	whuffor	the package name should be amarok-kde4, i believe
2008-12-15T02:24:00.000Z	whuffor	raylu	OK. I'll try that
2008-12-15T02:24:00.000Z	raylu	whuffor	tell me how it is for you, btw. i didn't like it much, though i didn't give it much of a real chance
2008-12-15T02:26:00.000Z	whuffor	raylu	It's installing now. I hopw it's the right version. :) How on earth did you know that the package name is amarok-kde4?
2008-12-15T02:27:00.000Z	raylu	whuffor	someone was asking about it yesterday
2008-12-15T02:27:00.000Z	raylu	whuffor	also, "aptitude search amarok" would have told you
2008-12-15T02:28:00.000Z	whuffor	raylu	Ahh. Very nice. Thank you very much for the help. Much appreciated here. :)
