2011-06-10T21:23:00.000Z	r1chm		hi everyone, does anyone know a (relatively simple) way to make HDMI audio output work with the Nvidia ION gfx?
2011-06-10T21:23:00.000Z	Polah	r1chm	audio output with graphics? That makes no sense.
2011-06-10T21:23:00.000Z	r1chm	Polah	 its a HDMI output. HDMI carries both audio and video?
2011-06-10T21:24:00.000Z	Polah	r1chm	I wouldn't think a graphics output would be sending audio thought.
2011-06-10T21:25:00.000Z	r1chm	Polah	im not too sure, the HDMI out in my windows PC does sound & audio i jsut assumed the HDMI out on this ubuntu pc would also
2011-06-10T21:26:00.000Z	r1chm	Polah	 i mean gfx and audio ;-)
2011-06-10T21:26:00.000Z	Polah	r1chm	Well, if it's a motherboard onboard output it might do, but if it's an output from a GPU it shouldn't have audio. Unless the card is some sort of audio/visual processor since it's for compact laptops (right?)
2011-06-10T21:33:00.000Z	Polah	r1chm	Are you audio settings configured to use that device and output for output?
2011-06-10T21:35:00.000Z	Polah	r1chm	What are you using to configure it?
2011-06-10T21:36:00.000Z	Polah	r1chm	The default pulse settings? Try installing pavucontrol, it might give you some better options. There's also an advanced ALSA configuration tool you could use instead but I can't recall the name.
2011-06-10T21:39:00.000Z	Polah	r1chm	Yes.
2011-06-10T21:45:00.000Z	r1chm	Polah	pulse audio isnt listing my HDMI output... which suggests the driver isnt installed?
2011-06-10T21:46:00.000Z	Polah	r1chm	It's not detecting the output certainly, if it exists. It could be a driver issue, yes.
2011-06-10T21:46:00.000Z	r1chm	Polah	i have found another driver in the "hardware drivers" dialog ill try that...
2011-06-10T21:47:00.000Z	r1chm	Polah	ive lied. it says its already activated :-(
2011-06-10T21:48:00.000Z	Polah	r1chm	I can't really help you with driver issues. Sorry.
2011-06-10T21:50:00.000Z	r1chm	Polah	im going to get the latest driver from the Nvidia website... how do i tell whether i am using 32 bit or 64 bit linux i cant remember which i downloaded.....
2011-06-10T21:51:00.000Z	Polah	r1chm	uname -i, i386 = 32-bit, amd64 = 64-bit
2011-06-10T21:53:00.000Z	Polah	r1chm	Do uname -a then
2011-06-10T21:59:00.000Z	Polah	r1chm	Have you checked if there's an audio control panel that was installed alongside the drivers?
2011-06-10T22:00:00.000Z	r1chm	Polah	i cant see that one has been installed.
