2004-12-18T15:54:00.000Z	siretart	faxons	I think it is just a proposal for a tool to do the described
2004-12-18T15:55:00.000Z	faxons	siretart	do you know if anyone is actually working on it?
2004-12-18T15:55:00.000Z	siretart	faxons	It is not too complicated to set something up like the described, in fact, a simple centralized ldap for authentication took me about 2h..
2004-12-18T15:56:00.000Z	faxons	siretart	which ldap version did you use?
2004-12-18T15:56:00.000Z	siretart	faxons	sorry, no. I would ask Jerry Halmton, author of that wiki page
2004-12-18T15:56:00.000Z	siretart	faxons	openldap from woody, a rather ancient one..
2004-12-18T15:56:00.000Z	siretart		but we plan migrating to sarge
2004-12-18T15:57:00.000Z	faxons	siretart	yea, I've spent a little time on the mailing list and any questions about older versions are answered with "upgrade"
2004-12-18T15:58:00.000Z	faxons	siretart	was the implementatin youre talking about for *nix clients only?
2004-12-18T15:58:00.000Z	siretart	faxons	yes, our setup is a rather small one: 6-8 debian sarge desktops
2004-12-18T16:00:00.000Z	faxons	siretart	do you know where I would find jerry halmton's email addy?
2004-12-18T16:00:00.000Z	siretart	faxons	nope, but i would try googling ;)
2004-12-18T16:01:00.000Z	faxons	siretart	just did, big miss
2004-12-18T16:01:00.000Z	siretart	faxons	but, If you really need such a tool and are willing to pay, I'm sure the guys at canonical would be able to arrange something ;)
2004-12-18T16:02:00.000Z	faxons	siretart	google works better when you spell the name right
2004-12-18T16:02:00.000Z	siretart		(no i'm not affiliated with canonical)
2004-12-18T16:02:00.000Z	siretart		;)
2004-12-18T16:02:00.000Z	faxons	siretart	actually i'm looking for a project to work on
2004-12-18T16:03:00.000Z	siretart		ah, even better :)
2004-12-18T16:04:00.000Z	faxons	siretart	it's something that's been missing for a little to long in my opinion
2004-12-18T16:04:00.000Z	siretart	faxons	yes, I aggree.
