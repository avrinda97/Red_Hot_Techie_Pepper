2005-04-16T15:33:00.000Z	whiskers		it just doesn't make sense
2005-04-16T15:33:00.000Z	whiskers		why are the menu fonts in oo2 nice in win98 but very tiny on gnome
2005-04-16T15:34:00.000Z	whiskers		now firefox has nice size menu fonts in gnome and win98...so why not oo2
2005-04-16T15:35:00.000Z	Arnia	whiskers	OOo2 is fine here...
2005-04-16T15:36:00.000Z	whiskers	Arnia	oo2 looks very bad here...the menu fonts seem to be about 8 or 9 pitch
2005-04-16T15:36:00.000Z	whiskers	Arnia	i can't understand why they are nice on win98
2005-04-16T15:37:00.000Z	Arnia	whiskers	Did you download the gnome GUI for it?
2005-04-16T15:37:00.000Z	whiskers	Arnia	oh...i did not know there was such a thing
2005-04-16T15:37:00.000Z	whiskers	Arnia	what is it called
2005-04-16T15:38:00.000Z	Arnia	whiskers	OOo2 separates its control and model from its view so that it can be used in differing desktop environments... I'll just find the packagename
2005-04-16T15:38:00.000Z	whiskers	Arnia	ok it is important to have  oo2 work just as good on linux as win98
2005-04-16T15:38:00.000Z	Arnia	whiskers	openoffice.org2-gnome
2005-04-16T15:39:00.000Z	whiskers	Arnia	ok let me try
2005-04-16T15:42:00.000Z	whiskers	Arnia	yes that fixed it...it looks beutiful...you are a genius
2005-04-16T15:45:00.000Z	Arnia	whiskers	No problem at all :)
2005-04-22T13:07:00.000Z	whiskers	Arnia	it is for efax-gtk
2005-04-22T13:07:00.000Z	whiskers	Arnia	you can scan in your docs and send them with efax-gtk
2005-04-22T13:08:00.000Z	whiskers	Arnia	that way you don't have to buy an outrageous fax machine
2005-04-22T13:09:00.000Z	Arnia	whiskers	heh
2005-04-22T13:13:00.000Z	Arnia	whiskers	And Gimp would do that too... since Gimpshop is Gimp with the UI code hacked about
2005-04-22T13:14:00.000Z	whiskers	Arnia	yes correct and it did on gentoo...but the buttons are easier
