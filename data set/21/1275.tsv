2011-01-14T16:04:00.000Z	ne2k	kwtm	I have maverick and installed flashplugin-installer, which gives 10.1.102.65
2011-01-14T16:00:00.000Z	ne2k	kwtm	you have a bank that requires FLASH? man, get out of there QUICKLY!
2011-01-14T16:01:00.000Z	kwtm	ne2k	Thanks for the comment.  I know of the recommendations, etc, but there is a specific reason I need this bank, so I do appreciate any help in getting flash working for this and other reasons.
2011-01-14T16:01:00.000Z	ne2k	kwtm	why do you specifically need flash 10?
2011-01-14T16:03:00.000Z	kwtm	ne2k	I actually want to fix the problem where Firefox says "the flash plugin has crashed"; I believe Flash 10 will solve this but am not sure.  Also because YouTube says "This video will only display in a more current version of flash".
2011-01-14T16:03:00.000Z	ne2k	kwtm	which version of ubuntu?
2011-01-14T16:04:00.000Z	ne2k	kwtm	and I use google chrome as the web browser
2011-01-14T16:04:00.000Z	kwtm	ne2k	Lucid (10.04)
2011-01-14T16:05:00.000Z	kwtm	ne2k	Okay, so your setup works but you are using Chrome, not Firefox, and you are using Maverick, not Lucid, then.
2011-01-14T16:30:00.000Z	kwtm	ne2k	Okay, so now that it works: to address your comment about banking and flash: my bank does NOT require flash for everyday banking.
2011-01-14T16:31:00.000Z	kwtm	ne2k	However, one important function requires flash: generating a disposable credit card number (the only way I will do eCommerce over the web)
2011-01-14T16:31:00.000Z	ne2k	kwtm	never heard of such a thing. don't you trust SSL?
2011-01-14T16:31:00.000Z	ne2k	kwtm	and, you know, like, the law?
2011-01-14T16:32:00.000Z	kwtm	ne2k	Not a matter of what I trust.  When I ask to use disposable credit card numbers, it launches a flash app.  What does that have to do with whether I trust SSL?
2011-01-14T16:32:00.000Z	ne2k	kwtm	I was wondering why you need a disposable credit card number. I just use my credit card and have never had any problems
2011-01-14T16:33:00.000Z	kwtm	ne2k	Ah, I see!  TO answer your question: I do trust SSL, but do not trust the corporate databases in which my credit card number is stored.
2011-01-14T16:33:00.000Z	kwtm	ne2k	And, no, I do not trust the law.  The law does not prevent crime from happening.  It merely punishes crime when it does happen.  (Maybe.)
2011-01-14T16:34:00.000Z	kwtm	ne2k	THere are other conveniences from disposable credit card numbers, too.
2011-01-14T16:35:00.000Z	kwtm	ne2k	For example, more than once I was on a web site buying something, but the website was flaky and it wasn't clear whether I was successful in buying or not.
2011-01-14T16:35:00.000Z	kwtm	ne2k	So, I simply bought the item again, without worrying about whether the first purchase went through.
2011-01-14T16:36:00.000Z	kwtm	ne2k	Because I had created a disposable credit card with a credit limit slightly above the amount I was going to spend, the second purchase would not go through if the first purchas already had.
