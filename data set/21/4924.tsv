2010-08-13T22:28:00.000Z	benjamin_		hi, my graphical interface doesnt work properly anymore, ie. I can't use nvidia anymore. When I do I get the xorg message that EDID of CRT-0 can't be found or something like that. What do I do?
2010-08-13T22:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	benjamin_	it means that udev is asking the monitor what it can do, and its not talking back
2010-08-13T22:29:00.000Z	benjamin_	ActionParsnip	ok, how do I fix that?
2010-08-13T22:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	benjamin_	if you run: sudo nvidia-xconfig ,the system will make an xorg.conf file with some ok settings for refresh rates which will tell the system what's what instead of the system working it out for itself
2010-08-13T22:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	benjamin_	you can then reboot and it should be ok
2010-08-13T22:31:00.000Z	benjamin_	ActionParsnip	I tried that it didn't do anything useful (ie. it didnt work at all)
2010-08-13T22:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	benjamin_	does your xorg.conf file now have text in it?
2010-08-13T22:31:00.000Z	benjamin_	ActionParsnip	of course
2010-08-13T22:31:00.000Z	benjamin_	ActionParsnip	at the moment I use "nv" instead of "nvidia"
2010-08-13T22:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	benjamin_	lucid doesn't ship one so no, not ofcourse
2010-08-13T22:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	benjamin_	you need to put stuff in the screen and monitor sections to define refresh rates as your monitor is not talking back to the system
2010-08-13T22:32:00.000Z	benjamin_	ActionParsnip	if there is no xorg.conf how does the graphical interface know which driver to use?
2010-08-13T22:33:00.000Z	benjamin_	ActionParsnip	but I dont know those settings
2010-08-13T22:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	benjamin_	hunt online for sample files, you will find sections or code you can use in your file, you will need: gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf ,to get write access
2010-08-13T22:34:00.000Z	benjamin_	ActionParsnip	but how do I know which settings to put there? if I just copy a file from the internet it will most probably not be a good setting
2010-08-13T22:35:00.000Z	benjamin_	ActionParsnip	it should be possible to autodetect such settings
2010-08-13T22:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	benjamin_	it is but you monitor doesn't do it
2010-08-13T22:35:00.000Z	benjamin_	ActionParsnip	hmm or how do I get the EDID to work? I mean something is obviously wrong since the new release of ubuntu (it worked perfectly before without entering anything)
2010-08-13T22:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	benjamin_	new monitor, or connect it to the white connector instead of vga
2010-08-13T23:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	benjamin_	then rerun: sudo nvidia-xconfig ,to get a virgin file
2012-04-02T15:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	benjamin_	how do you mean 'connect'? If you ping it makes a connection..
