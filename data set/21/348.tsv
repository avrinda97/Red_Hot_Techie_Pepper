2012-02-20T15:01:00.000Z	aBound	Pikkachu	They do kinda feel like it.
2012-02-20T15:06:00.000Z	Pikkachu	aBound	I'm feeling like that right now in pidgin, spell check not working...not showing in tray or whatever...exiting when I click close (when in tray -- as set in config -- it should hide not exit)...:'-(
2012-02-20T15:09:00.000Z	Pikkachu	aBound	it looks like the other releases are steps towards a freeze which they call LTS
2012-02-20T15:09:00.000Z	Pikkachu	aBound	so they don't matter that much to experiment with stuff in the other releases, but they wonder to be stable in LTS I suppose
2012-02-20T15:09:00.000Z	aBound	Pikkachu	Kinda like what Fedora does with it's Enterprise product.
2012-02-20T15:10:00.000Z	Pikkachu	aBound	I'm not sure if I like this :(
2012-02-20T15:11:00.000Z	aBound	Pikkachu	At least you can expect a more stable release at best. Before moving onto the next upgrade.
2012-02-20T15:12:00.000Z	Pikkachu	aBound	but you keep stuck on old software
2012-02-20T15:13:00.000Z	Pikkachu	aBound	you're already stuck in regular releases, much more with LTS :( I imagine they do a lot of backporting for LTS
2012-02-20T15:14:00.000Z	aBound	Pikkachu	Put it this way would you rather have stability or the latest packages?
2012-02-20T15:17:00.000Z	Pikkachu	aBound	that's why I imagine a lot of backporting...because time is often a bug itself... for example libreoffice releases new stuff with big improvements you feel annoyed not having access to, and lots of bug fixing...usptream tend to not support old versions and encourange updating... while in ubuntu these old versions are still there in the LTSes to be maintained... by Canonical (that's why I imagine a lot of backporting for the most important bugs)
2012-02-20T15:19:00.000Z	aBound	Pikkachu	I agree with the whole bugs aspect but with newer features it's only necessary if it benefits you in some way otherwise upgrading may not be necessary. But I know some people like to stay up to date and I won't disregard that.
2012-02-20T15:26:00.000Z	Pikkachu	aBound	I see the hidden scrollbar so I suppose it's using gtk2, it doesn't know unity exists, I think it adds a tray icon to gnome panel which is not running so...
2012-02-20T15:28:00.000Z	Pikkachu	aBound	it's shown in the sidebar regardless but you have to remember to minimize buddy list not close it, it's annoying (because in gnome 2, closing it with tray icon enabled would close buddy list not whole app)
2012-02-20T15:28:00.000Z	Pikkachu	aBound	an older version of what?
2012-02-20T15:28:00.000Z	aBound	Pikkachu	I'd figure you were using an older version of Ubuntu.
2012-02-20T15:29:00.000Z	Pikkachu	aBound	no it's 11.10 + Unity, but unity does not have tray support as in gnome 2, it seems
2012-02-20T15:29:00.000Z	aBound	Pikkachu	I noticed yet as long as I can see it on my sidebar.
2012-02-20T15:33:00.000Z	Pikkachu	aBound	unity in natty runs on gnome 2
2012-02-20T15:35:00.000Z	Pikkachu	aBound	afaik GTK is a gui toolkit like Swing, SWT, ATW, Qt etc
2012-02-20T15:36:00.000Z	Pikkachu	aBound	and gnome is bult on top of it
