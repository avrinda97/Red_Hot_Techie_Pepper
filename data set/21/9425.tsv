2009-05-27T08:03:00.000Z	Wiseman2		Ok, the long and short of it is this:  I may have installed the incorrect display drivers in ubuntu.  I just updated them and now I get a garbled mess when the system boots.
2009-05-27T08:03:00.000Z	Wiseman2		man, my intertubes are being real flaky tonight
2009-05-27T08:04:00.000Z	Wiseman2		What do I do?  I can't get into ubuntu now.
2009-05-27T08:04:00.000Z	usr13	Wiseman2	What display driver did you install?
2009-05-27T08:04:00.000Z	Wiseman2		ATI Radeon HD2400
2009-05-27T08:04:00.000Z	Wiseman2		which the spec sheet says is what my comp has
2009-05-27T08:05:00.000Z	Wiseman2		Jordan:  At grub, there is an option to go into recovery mode
2009-05-27T08:06:00.000Z	Wiseman2	Jack_Sparrow	assuming that works, then what?
2009-05-27T08:06:00.000Z	Wiseman2		I dual boot vista, so I can't have both open at the same time
2009-05-27T08:07:00.000Z	Wiseman2		Jack:  I would have no idea what to do once I get a terminal open
2009-05-27T08:07:00.000Z	Wiseman2		How do I revert back to what I had before?
2009-05-27T08:07:00.000Z	usr13	Wiseman2	Wiseman2 Ctrl-Alt-F6
2009-05-27T08:08:00.000Z	usr13	Wiseman2	login with your user name and password
2009-05-27T08:08:00.000Z	Wiseman2		I'm not sure that helps me if I can't see the terminal
2009-05-27T08:08:00.000Z	usr13	Wiseman2	 sudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-05-27T08:09:00.000Z	Wiseman2		well I get internet through wireless, which is through NDISWRAPPER.  Would i have that if I boot into this recovery mode?
2009-05-27T08:09:00.000Z	usr13	Wiseman2	Ctrl-Alt-F6  Login with user name and password.  suod rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-05-27T08:10:00.000Z	Wiseman2		What's xorg?
2009-05-27T08:10:00.000Z	Wiseman2		that's not gonna screw anything up?
2009-05-27T08:10:00.000Z	Wiseman2		....worse than it already is?
2009-05-27T08:10:00.000Z	usr13	Wiseman2	Nope
