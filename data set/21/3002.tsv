2010-11-26T03:49:00.000Z	KruyKaze	VCoolio	i upgraded to 10.10 from 10.04 and my laptop started crashing randomely
2010-11-26T03:50:00.000Z	KruyKaze		usually when the'eres a video playing
2010-11-26T03:50:00.000Z	KruyKaze		vlc or totem or youtube
2010-11-26T03:50:00.000Z	KruyKaze		the same sound gets repeated 3 times then a freeze and i have to force shutdown
2010-11-26T03:50:00.000Z	VCoolio	KruyKaze	define crash: black? reboot? screen freeze? correct video driver installed?
2010-11-26T03:51:00.000Z	KruyKaze	VCoolio	screen freeze
2010-11-26T03:51:00.000Z	KruyKaze	VCoolio	checking driver now
2010-11-26T03:52:00.000Z	KruyKaze	VCoolio	driver was not activated will do that right away and test again
2010-11-26T05:15:00.000Z	KruyKaze	VCoolio	i'm back after installing the ati driver i still got  a freeze
2010-11-26T05:15:00.000Z	KruyKaze	VCoolio	i was playing music this time
2010-11-26T05:16:00.000Z	KruyKaze	VCoolio	i hear the last second of music 3 times and i get a black screen and everything stops
2010-11-26T05:18:00.000Z	VCoolio	KruyKaze	hi, well then video driver isn't the issue I guess; see if you can ctrl+alt+f1 into console; if yes, system hasn't crashed and also saves you a reboot; read some log files in /var/log and see if something useful comes up
2010-11-26T05:19:00.000Z	VCoolio	KruyKaze	I can 't really help without error message or something; feeling too insecure to guess around on 'black screen error'
2010-11-26T05:19:00.000Z	KruyKaze	VCoolio	i understand what file should i look for?

2010-11-26T05:21:00.000Z	KruyKaze		thanks
2010-11-26T05:21:00.000Z	VCoolio	KruyKaze	method 2 if you can get to console after crash
2010-11-26T05:22:00.000Z	KruyKaze		will do
2010-11-26T05:24:00.000Z	KruyKaze	VCoolio	i guess i'll just wait for next crash :) shouldn't be too long (fortunately/unfortunately)
2010-11-26T05:24:00.000Z	KruyKaze	VCoolio	why wouldn't it only happen with 10.10 is the q
