2008-06-12T19:47:00.000Z	The-Seiman		mr:boo: you must reinstall grub
2008-06-12T19:48:00.000Z	The-Seiman		i've also found read somewhere that linux can be booted from ntldr
2008-06-12T19:49:00.000Z	The-Seiman		well, no one can help me on my intel 965GM problem ?
2008-06-12T19:50:00.000Z	ASULutzy	The-Seiman	What problem?
2008-06-12T19:51:00.000Z	ASULutzy	The-Seiman	I have a 965 in my laptop, and I'm pretty ticked at it... I can't get my S-video to do so much as make my TV flicker using the intel driver. Means I have to leave Windows installed on this thing
2008-06-12T19:51:00.000Z	ASULutzy	The-Seiman	Slow for what? Like gaming, or compiz?
2008-06-12T19:52:00.000Z	ASULutzy	The-Seiman	Cause let's be honest, onboard isn't really the greatest for 3d intensive stuff
2008-06-12T19:52:00.000Z	The-Seiman	ASULutzy	60 FPS isn't really good
2008-06-12T19:52:00.000Z	ASULutzy	The-Seiman	60 FPS? Is it stuck at exactly 60 FPS?
2008-06-12T19:52:00.000Z	The-Seiman	ASULutzy	and under Windows, I get 10x times more
2008-06-12T19:53:00.000Z	ASULutzy	The-Seiman	Cause 60 is a pretty round number, sounds like you forgot to turn V-sync off lol!
2008-06-12T19:53:00.000Z	The-Seiman	ASULutzy	V-sync ? I'm a newbie yes ...
2008-06-12T19:54:00.000Z	The-Seiman	ASULutzy	should I disable it with driconf ?
2008-06-12T19:54:00.000Z	ASULutzy	The-Seiman	Google it. It's an option that can be turned on in Windows or in Linux. It's short for vertical sync. Basically it caps your framerate out at exactly your monitor's refresh rate. It prevents screen tearing
2008-06-12T19:55:00.000Z	ASULutzy	The-Seiman	But if you are capped at exactly 60 FPS then it's definitely V-sync. Though V-sync isn't necessarily bad. Depending on what game I'm playing on my desktop I turn it on
2008-06-12T19:57:00.000Z	ASULutzy	The-Seiman	I find it really weird that no one in #xorg would suggest vsync as what's holding your FPS back...
2008-06-12T19:59:00.000Z	The-Seiman	ASULutzy	well, they heard "Ubuntu" and they immediatly suggested me to build the lastest drivers because Ubuntu's ones are too old
2008-06-12T19:59:00.000Z	ASULutzy	The-Seiman	Tricky programmers, always looking for the complicated problems first ;)
2008-06-12T20:25:00.000Z	ASULutzy	The-Seiman	Weird. I would download compiz-check (just google it, a guy on the forums showed it to me, it's a cool script that basically lets you know everything about what's going on) It could be something with xgl versus aiglx... Are you using the intel driver or the i810? But yea, check out compiz-check script
2008-06-12T20:28:00.000Z	The-Seiman	ASULutzy	okay thanks, i'll try the compiz-check script, about the drivers, I really don't know, in xorg.conf I have only Configured Video Device *_*
