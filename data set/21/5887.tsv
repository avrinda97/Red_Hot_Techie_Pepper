2007-10-08T07:38:00.000Z	flush		im trying to start one but it says "device /dev/dsp already in use"
2007-10-08T07:40:00.000Z	kbrooks	flush	use a pastebin
2007-10-08T07:39:00.000Z	kbrooks	flush	um, open a terminal. type lsof /dev/dsp
2007-10-08T07:40:00.000Z	flush	kbrooks	it returns..
2007-10-08T07:40:00.000Z	kbrooks	flush	dont paste here
2007-10-08T07:41:00.000Z	flush	kbrooks	i hit enter.. it waits for like 3 seconds then terminal returns
2007-10-08T07:41:00.000Z	kbrooks	flush	does it say ANYTHING? see above too
2007-10-08T07:42:00.000Z	flush	kbrooks	 o, doesnt say anything
2007-10-08T07:43:00.000Z	flush	kbrooks	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/39954/
2007-10-08T07:45:00.000Z	kbrooks	flush	then you're going to have to type lsof and pastebin the output. but don't type just that. type "lsof > lsof.output", and then open up the file with your favorite text editor and select all then paste to pastebin
2007-10-08T07:45:00.000Z	kbrooks	flush	don't type the quotes.
2007-10-08T07:46:00.000Z	kbrooks	flush	the quotes are there to seperate the message from what i'm saying
2007-10-08T07:46:00.000Z	flush	kbrooks	k
2007-10-08T07:46:00.000Z	kbrooks	flush	and by "the file", i mean lsof.output - sorry
2007-10-08T07:48:00.000Z	flush	kbrooks	the output is incredibly long..
2007-10-08T07:49:00.000Z	kbrooks	flush	if you want
2007-10-08T07:49:00.000Z	flush	kbrooks	theres nothing using /dev/dsp
2007-10-08T07:50:00.000Z	kbrooks	flush	just as i thought
2007-10-08T07:50:00.000Z	flush	kbrooks	so what do you think i should do now?
