2009-01-26T17:28:00.000Z	TelQuel_		hrm I am trying to load a theme with emerald... and I imported it, but now how do I apply it?
2009-01-26T17:28:00.000Z	fosco_	TelQuel_	if you are using emerald window decorations you'll see the new theme inmediatly
2009-01-26T17:29:00.000Z	TelQuel_		well I installed emerald, how do I know if I am using decorations? I am pretty sure I am.
2009-01-26T17:31:00.000Z	TelQuel_	fosco_	I have emerald installed and in the emerald settings everything appears 'on' so I am not sure how to apply the theme.
2009-01-26T17:32:00.000Z	fosco_	TelQuel_	mostly sure you are no using emerald, open a terminal and type emerald --replace to use it
2009-01-26T17:33:00.000Z	TelQuel_	fosco_	ok that made the terminal box change theme but why didn't the rest? lol
2009-01-26T17:33:00.000Z	fosco_	TelQuel_	make sure all windows are owned by the same user, do not use sudo nor su
2009-01-26T17:34:00.000Z	TelQuel_	fosco_	I didn't use sudo or anything... as soon as I close the terminal window the theme goes away
2009-01-26T17:35:00.000Z	TelQuel_	fosco_	though I got it to apply for the various windows it disappeared as soon as I closed the terminal
2009-01-26T17:35:00.000Z	fosco_	TelQuel_	when you clse the terminal you close emerald
2009-01-26T17:35:00.000Z	fosco_	TelQuel_	you'd better use fusion-icon to change compiz options
2009-01-26T17:36:00.000Z	TelQuel_	fosco_	alright well I am obviously fairly new to this... so do you mean to say there is no way to actually make it so that my GUI always appears with that theme?
2009-01-26T17:36:00.000Z	fosco_	TelQuel_	there are many ways to do that
2009-01-26T17:37:00.000Z	fosco_		fusion-icon is one of them
2009-01-26T17:37:00.000Z	TelQuel_	fosco_	well which way is the easiest? haha.
2009-01-26T17:37:00.000Z	fosco_	TelQuel_	i told you, install and use fusion-icon
2009-01-26T17:38:00.000Z	TelQuel_		ok it is installing
2009-01-26T17:39:00.000Z	TelQuel_	fosco_	alright so how do I access compiz once it is installed? does it go into my applications or is it in system prefs?
2009-01-26T17:39:00.000Z	TelQuel_		found it
2009-01-26T17:39:00.000Z	fosco_	TelQuel_	just try, it is easy
2009-01-26T17:41:00.000Z	TelQuel_	fosco_	ok I have the emerald decorations on in compiz fusion but I cannot apply the theme via terminal anymore for whatever reason
