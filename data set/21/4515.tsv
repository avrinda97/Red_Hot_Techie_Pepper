2008-11-07T19:10:00.000Z	_hase		Like, it's not going to mess up the xorg to run that command, is basically what I meant to ask
2008-11-07T19:11:00.000Z	_hase		ok, thanks joaopinto, I'll do it, I just hope it doesn't delete all my wife's music
2008-11-07T19:12:00.000Z	_hase		"WARNING!!!  Running e2fsck on a mounted filesystem may cause
2008-11-07T19:12:00.000Z	_hase		SEVERE filesystem damage." carry on?
2008-11-07T19:12:00.000Z	_hase		Is it supposed to say that?
2008-11-07T19:12:00.000Z	_hase		what's resuce mode?
2008-11-07T19:12:00.000Z	_hase		and no don't run it now?  k
2008-11-07T19:13:00.000Z	_hase		I'm kind of nervous to do it, cause if It messes up my xorg and I can't log back into the chat I won't have anyway to find help
2008-11-07T19:13:00.000Z	ay^	_hase	install irssi, command line irc-client
2008-11-07T19:14:00.000Z	ay^	_hase	and backup xorg.conf ;P
2008-11-07T19:14:00.000Z	_hase	ikonia	I hate to sound like a windows noob, but do I back the xorg just by copying and pasting?
2008-11-07T19:14:00.000Z	ay^	_hase	yep thats how its done eaily ;)
2008-11-07T19:14:00.000Z	_hase		thanks!
2008-11-07T19:14:00.000Z	ay^	_hase	we've all been noobs, especially me
2008-11-07T19:15:00.000Z	_hase		thank you to everyone helping out, i'm running "sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup" that scunizi suggested
2008-11-07T19:15:00.000Z	ay^	_hase	do that, and good luck to you!
2008-11-07T19:16:00.000Z	_hase		i hate how the terminal doesn't say if it worked when stuff works, double checking to the xorg backup and then I'm going to reboot into rescue mode
2008-11-07T19:16:00.000Z	ay^	_hase	heh thats how it says it went without errors ;P
2008-11-07T19:16:00.000Z	_hase		ok, all backed up, and I installed the command line irc thing
2008-11-07T19:16:00.000Z	_hase		thanks everyone hopefully this works out
2008-11-07T19:16:00.000Z	ay^	_hase	remember freenode and #ubuntu :)
