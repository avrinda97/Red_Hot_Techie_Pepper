2009-11-18T20:21:00.000Z	ner0x		Anyone here know anything about hardware modems/
2009-11-18T20:22:00.000Z	ner0x		I have a hardware modem that *should* work out of the box on linux. No luck, says my "sorry, no modem was detected"
2009-11-18T20:23:00.000Z	ner0x		it's hardware based usb.
2009-11-18T20:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	ner0x	but where do you specify the modem dev file ? for a usb modem should be /dev/ttyACM0 iirc
2009-11-18T20:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	ner0x	serial ? usb? pci ?
2009-11-18T20:24:00.000Z	erUSUL	ner0x	how are you testing the modem ?
2009-11-18T20:25:00.000Z	ner0x	erUSUL	Attempting to use it normally "fax send -l <NUMBER> <FILE>
2009-11-18T20:26:00.000Z	ner0x	erUSUL	It's in .efaxrc DEV=/dev/ttyACM0
2009-11-18T20:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	ner0x	the easiest way to see if the modem is recogniced by linux is: run « taif /var/log/messages » then plug the modem paste the new output in paste.ubuntu.com
2009-11-18T20:27:00.000Z	ner0x	erUSUL	It's detected for sure /dev/ttyACM0 is created in /dev
2009-11-18T20:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	ner0x	ok; then something else is failing
2009-11-18T20:31:00.000Z	ner0x	erUSUL	http://paste.ubuntu.com/321601/
2009-11-18T20:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	ner0x	if the modem is recogniced then the patch is already aplied. you do not have to patch the kernel
2009-11-18T20:33:00.000Z	ner0x	erUSUL	Well, it said to make it be able to send AT commands.
2009-11-18T20:33:00.000Z	ner0x	erUSUL	I haven't been successful in that realm yet.
2009-11-18T20:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	ner0x	sudo sh -c "echo 'ATZ' > /dev/ttyACM0"
2010-01-23T04:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	ner0x	you can not; you can disable dhcp and use static ip's though
2010-01-23T04:01:00.000Z	ner0x	erUSUL	I think that's the route I'd like to take.
2010-01-23T04:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	ner0x	the thing is if you do not want to use a MAC<-->IP assignemet you rule out the only way a dhcp server can assing you a deterministic ip address
2010-01-23T04:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	ner0x	disable it in your router? (keep in mind dhcp may be giving you more than the ip; dns servers for instance)
2011-02-23T03:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	ner0x	just ask the question and find out
