2008-03-04T05:12:00.000Z	thinkpaduser	luis_	 uses lame to convert
2008-03-04T05:14:00.000Z	thinkpaduser	luis_	 you can do it from a command-line script, ie ogg2mp3 (Google it)
2008-03-04T05:14:00.000Z	thinkpaduser	luis_	 i don't know any GUI programs to convert ogg files to mp3s off hand
2008-03-04T05:16:00.000Z	thinkpaduser	luis_	 look into soundconverter.  that might be what you want
2008-03-04T05:17:00.000Z	thinkpaduser	luis_	 it uses the gstreamer libraries for lame, i believe
2008-03-04T05:18:00.000Z	thinkpaduser	luis_	 try 'apt-cache search soundconverter'.  if it doesn't return anything you may need another repo in your /etc/apt/sources.list
2008-03-04T05:20:00.000Z	thinkpaduser	luis_	 apt-get install soundconverter
2008-03-04T05:20:00.000Z	thinkpaduser	luis_	 it *should* install the dependencies and you can then run it from the menu
2008-03-04T05:21:00.000Z	thinkpaduser	luis_	 sorry, try 'sudo apt-get install soundconverter'
2008-03-04T05:22:00.000Z	thinkpaduser	luis_	 here's the website for it: http://soundconverter.berlios.de/
2008-03-04T05:22:00.000Z	thinkpaduser	luis_	 with screenshots
2008-03-04T06:42:00.000Z	thinkpaduser	luis_	 it means it broke half way through installing
2008-03-04T06:44:00.000Z	thinkpaduser	luis_	 try 'sudo apt-get install -f'
2008-03-04T06:44:00.000Z	thinkpaduser	luis_	 oh, n/m
2008-03-04T06:48:00.000Z	thinkpaduser	luis_	 that is the debconf dialog for configuring packages, most likely
2008-03-04T06:48:00.000Z	thinkpaduser	luis_	 just another way of configuring stuff
2008-03-04T06:49:00.000Z	thinkpaduser	luis_	 try installing the same package through the Synaptic package installer?
