2011-05-23T07:20:00.000Z	edbian	dkhe	No.  It's just a hard question
2011-05-23T07:20:00.000Z	dkhe	edbian	oh ok, ill make it easier.
2011-05-23T07:20:00.000Z	edbian	dkhe	I think you have to use a mail program.  You could use a CLI one if that's the issue
2011-05-23T07:21:00.000Z	dkhe	edbian	CLI?
2011-05-23T07:22:00.000Z	edbian	dkhe	command line  (not graphical)
2011-05-23T07:22:00.000Z	dkhe	edbian	i dont know what that is.
2011-05-23T07:22:00.000Z	edbian	dkhe	The GUI is stuff you click on.  The terminal is CLI
2011-05-23T07:23:00.000Z	edbian	dkhe	Why do you need to wget things from an email??
2011-05-23T07:23:00.000Z	dkhe	edbian	thats the only way i know how to get files. I just wanted to get a .zip file from my email so i can extract it in terminal.
2011-05-23T07:23:00.000Z	edbian	dkhe	How do you view your emails normally?
2011-05-23T07:24:00.000Z	edbian	dkhe	wget is used to download things from the web, email is not web
2011-05-23T07:24:00.000Z	dkhe	edbian	i just open my email. So i downloaded the .zip file so how could i get it in terminal?
2011-05-23T07:24:00.000Z	edbian	dkhe	cd into the folder you downloaded it into
2011-05-23T07:25:00.000Z	dkhe	edbian	yea but i need to get it in to a shell.
2011-05-23T07:25:00.000Z	edbian	dkhe	Read up on how to use the terminal and the answer will be very clear
