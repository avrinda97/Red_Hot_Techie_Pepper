2008-02-06T08:53:00.000Z	BinarySphinx		Anyone know if there's a good version of Ubuntu to put on PS3? yellowdog just doesn't cut it.
2008-02-06T08:53:00.000Z	BinarySphinx		I'd love to install it, but need that little (switch to PS3 game OS) widget.
2008-02-06T08:54:00.000Z	BinarySphinx		Jason: terrible, don't do it.
2008-02-06T08:54:00.000Z	BinarySphinx		I mean, the thing basically runs on it to begin with, but trying any normal desktop ui on it ends in massive fail.
2008-02-06T08:56:00.000Z	BinarySphinx		PSP linux?
2008-02-06T08:56:00.000Z	BinarySphinx		That's not OT
2008-02-06T08:56:00.000Z	BinarySphinx		hsystem: Wha?
2008-02-06T08:58:00.000Z	BinarySphinx		Yeah, I've got Yellowdog, but...
2008-02-06T08:58:00.000Z	BinarySphinx		Well, it sucks horribly.
2008-02-06T08:59:00.000Z	BinarySphinx		Hence being in #Ubuntu
2008-02-06T09:01:00.000Z	diabolix	BinarySphinx	you dont have to, at the boot prompt type "boot-game-os"
2008-02-06T09:02:00.000Z	diabolix	BinarySphinx	or maybe boot_game_os, i cant remember
2008-02-06T09:03:00.000Z	diabolix	BinarySphinx	you normally get a prompt where you just hit enter to boot, right? its been a while since i used ps3 linux, they may have changed things on me since.
2008-02-06T09:03:00.000Z	BinarySphinx	diabolix	to boot, you need logpass.
2008-02-06T09:04:00.000Z	BinarySphinx	diabolix	You must enter your logpass, but that is not the issue; I need to find an easy way to return the system default boot mode.
2008-02-06T09:05:00.000Z	diabolix	BinarySphinx	when i did it, it start something called loadlin, which was just a small linux that booted the new linux kernel off the hard drive, if you typed "boot_game_os" instead of hitting enter, it would boot into the game os.
2008-02-06T09:05:00.000Z	BinarySphinx	diabolix	ohh, that part of boot.
2008-02-06T09:05:00.000Z	BinarySphinx		lol
2008-02-06T09:05:00.000Z	diabolix		yeah, i never had to reset anything.
2008-02-06T09:06:00.000Z	BinarySphinx	diabolix	I guess I just need to figure out syntax.
2008-02-06T09:06:00.000Z	BinarySphinx	diabolix	actually, I'll try that right now.
