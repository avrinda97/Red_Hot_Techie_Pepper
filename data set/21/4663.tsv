2008-03-08T11:45:00.000Z	sap1		Hi, Just wanted to know if there is a "post-it" or "sticky notes"  type program for ubuntu/linux  ?
2008-03-08T11:46:00.000Z	sap1		hmm.. wow lots of choice, so which one is the recommended ?
2008-03-08T11:46:00.000Z	sap1		k ty , i have gnome , so i guess i'll try tomboy or desklets
2008-03-08T11:47:00.000Z	sap1		k
2008-03-08T11:48:00.000Z	sap1		Umm.. anotehr bigger prob is that: My x-sane runs only as a root with my hp-PSC 1510 ? any ideas/suggestions?
2008-03-08T11:49:00.000Z	friedtofu	sap1	- add yourself to the scanner group
2008-03-08T11:49:00.000Z	sap1	friedtofu	umm.. i think i tried that but it didnt help (i hope i tried it the corrrect way :) )
2008-03-08T11:50:00.000Z	friedtofu	sap1	can you go in terminal and type in "groups" just to be sure?
2008-03-08T11:51:00.000Z	sap1	friedtofu	ya the user is in the group "scanner"
2008-03-08T11:51:00.000Z	friedtofu		hm. i really cant find the reason - my scanner wasnt working in the first place - - hplip installed and root can see it?
2008-03-08T11:52:00.000Z	friedtofu	sap1	if root can see it, and you're a user under scanner group - try restarting your computer and test it again
2008-03-08T11:53:00.000Z	sap1	friedtofu	and my "stupid" hp printer-scanner always wants to print a test page whenever it is started
2008-03-08T11:53:00.000Z	sap1	friedtofu	ya i tried restarting when i did all that
2008-03-08T11:54:00.000Z	friedtofu		hm. well - i really have no clue then :/ it works for my psc 2350... good luck on trying to get it to work
2008-03-08T11:55:00.000Z	sap1	friedtofu	the thing is that i have to start it from terminal by typing "sudo xsane". but if I only type "xsane" it says "Segmentation fault (core dumped)"
2008-03-08T11:56:00.000Z	sap1	friedtofu	anyway, it's ok . i'll keep on trying to find a solution :)
2008-03-08T11:56:00.000Z	friedtofu	sap1	try doing "sudo scanimage -L" and see what comes out
2008-03-08T11:57:00.000Z	sap1	friedtofu	gives the error "sudo: scanimage: command not found"
2008-03-08T11:57:00.000Z	friedtofu		huh. strange - i thought that came with xsane. ah well
2008-03-08T11:58:00.000Z	sap1	friedtofu	is that necessary to install for xsane to work. i mean like a dependency ?
2008-03-08T11:58:00.000Z	friedtofu	sap1	not really sure - not in ubuntu atm
