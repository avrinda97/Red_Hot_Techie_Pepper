2010-01-21T13:57:00.000Z	retry	llutz	is that so? I dont network via usb
2010-01-21T13:56:00.000Z	llutz	retry	if tomato would support usb.... :(
2010-01-21T13:57:00.000Z	retry	llutz	what about ddwrt?
2010-01-21T13:57:00.000Z	llutz	retry	it cannot, so i had to switch to dd-wrt on my asus-router.
2010-01-21T13:58:00.000Z	retry	llutz	aha figured...either way the open source firmwares totally pwn anything stock on consumer grade routers
2010-01-21T13:58:00.000Z	llutz	retry	i liked tomato much more than dd-wrt, had it on my wrt54gl (sry for /OT)
2010-01-21T13:58:00.000Z	retry	llutz	yup we are in agreement then
2010-01-21T14:24:00.000Z	retry	llutz	says tomato cant network over usb though
2010-01-21T14:25:00.000Z	llutz	retry	not network over usb,, access usb-storage/printers etc no usb-support at all

2010-01-27T15:07:00.000Z	retry	llutz	free as in free beer...ubuntu users dont care so much about free speech
2010-01-27T15:09:00.000Z	llutz	retry	even free people should respect some rules.
2010-01-27T15:10:00.000Z	retry	llutz	I don't disagree ... freedom is a finite resource we need to share it for the common good
2010-01-27T15:36:00.000Z	llutz	retry	Xwindow, no "s" </nitpick> ;)
2010-01-27T15:37:00.000Z	retry	llutz	it's always been X to me really
