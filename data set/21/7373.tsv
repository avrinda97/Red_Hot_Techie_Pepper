2006-10-13T10:12:00.000Z	awilcox_		How long will it take for IRC to realise I sent irssi the SIGHUP signal?

2006-10-13T10:14:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	awilcox_	yes ... so ... no idea .... can take a while..
2006-10-13T10:22:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	awilcox_	you can answer it if you know the answer ... we are not paid so i won't fight with anyone for the help.. :P
2006-10-13T10:22:00.000Z	awilcox_	wickedpuppy	huh?
2006-10-13T10:22:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	awilcox_	the question he posted to me ... you can answer it if you want ...
2006-10-13T10:23:00.000Z	awilcox_	wickedpuppy	I have no clue
2006-10-13T10:24:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	awilcox_	look up .. he posted the question to me ... and you ask him to ask the channel ... i am saying thats basically asking the channel ... you can answer for me if you know the answer .. not necessarily i must answer .. pm is another thing of course
2006-10-13T10:24:00.000Z	awilcox_	wickedpuppy	I'm not sure, maybe it's #wine, but I thought that one of the rules here was ask the channel not one person
2006-10-13T10:25:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	awilcox_	 there is no such rule .. the only thing will be to pm without asking for permission .. anyone can any question ...
