2006-01-13T14:43:00.000Z	psusi	trkorecky	raid5 is better imho... more usable space
2006-01-13T14:43:00.000Z	psusi	trkorecky	and faster
2006-01-13T14:52:00.000Z	psusi	trkorecky	the ununtu installer will automatically prompt you to shrink windows and install to the free space
2006-01-13T15:04:00.000Z	psusi	trkorecky	both... or even better, a new computer ;)
2006-01-13T15:05:00.000Z	psusi	trkorecky	what kind of ram and hard drive do you have now?
2006-01-13T15:05:00.000Z	psusi	trkorecky	and you are running xwindows on this machine, or using it as a file server?
2006-01-13T15:06:00.000Z	trkorecky	psusi	X.  I wouldn't mind using it as a temporary web server or something (though my ISP does not allow permanent servers)
2006-01-13T15:06:00.000Z	trkorecky	psusi	This computer is mostly for playing around with Linux
2006-01-13T15:07:00.000Z	psusi	trkorecky	ok... so what kind of ram and disk are in it now? if you plan on running xwindows on it you will want a minimum of 256 megs
2006-01-13T15:07:00.000Z	trkorecky	psusi	I'm not sure about the hard drive, I think it's 5400RPM but it holds 4GB.  The RAM is at 414MB
2006-01-13T15:08:00.000Z	psusi	trkorecky	that's a funky number... ram allways comes in powers of two... should be 512
2006-01-13T15:08:00.000Z	psusi	trkorecky	at that point I'd say get a new drive...
2006-01-13T15:09:00.000Z	trkorecky	psusi	I added all the RAM I had laying around the house.  It's 256+128+32 (alright, 416MB, I can't count)
2006-01-13T15:10:00.000Z	trkorecky	psusi	I may have another 128MB somewhere, but I don't think it worked with this motherboard, had some error in POST
2006-01-13T15:10:00.000Z	psusi	trkorecky	lol.... depending on the speed of the ram modules, you might be better off getting rid of the 32mb one.. if it is slower, it will slow them all down so it can keep up
2006-01-13T15:11:00.000Z	psusi	trkorecky	and yea... get a better hard drive...
2006-01-13T15:11:00.000Z	trkorecky	psusi	I'll see how much I have left after I get a new graphics card for my gaming computer.
2006-01-13T15:12:00.000Z	trkorecky	psusi	Where would be the best place to get an inexpensive hard drive?  Computer shows?  Ebay?  Elsewhere?
2006-01-13T15:13:00.000Z	psusi	trkorecky	computer shows or ebay... you should be able to pick up a used 7200 rpm drive for dirt cheap
2006-01-13T15:13:00.000Z	trkorecky	psusi	Alright, I'll look around
