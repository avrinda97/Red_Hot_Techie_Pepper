2010-03-02T04:28:00.000Z	zetheroo		any way to make USB volumes mount automatically upon being plugged in?
2010-03-02T04:29:00.000Z	zetheroo		also why do USB volumes mount automatically on my Desktop and not on my laptop? Both are running Karmic ...
2010-03-02T04:30:00.000Z	VCoolio	zetheroo	/dev/<device> /media/<mountpoint> auto user,defaults 0 0
2010-03-02T04:30:00.000Z	VCoolio	zetheroo	also check nautilus > edit > preferences > behavior tab first; easier if it works
2010-03-02T04:32:00.000Z	VCoolio	zetheroo	I don't know what is default in nautilus; maybe they changed something; shouldn't be difficult though
2010-03-04T17:44:00.000Z	VCoolio	zetheroo	edit /usr/share/gdm/autostart/LoginWindow/libcanberra-ready-sound.desktop
2010-03-04T17:44:00.000Z	zetheroo	VCoolio	seriously ... this was doable through a graphical frontend before ... are we going forward or backward!? :P
2010-03-04T17:45:00.000Z	VCoolio	zetheroo	there is no gui by default for gdm2, but check gdm2setup on launchpad.net
2010-03-04T17:46:00.000Z	VCoolio	zetheroo	it doesn't provide an option to change the sound, only toggle the drums on/off; edit the file or replace the sound in /usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/stereo
2010-03-04T17:48:00.000Z	zetheroo	VCoolio	I see ... well I have the file open ... how do i turn it off?
2010-03-04T17:48:00.000Z	VCoolio	zetheroo	change the exec= line, delete or replace everything behind the =
2010-03-04T17:49:00.000Z	zetheroo	VCoolio	can i comment it out in case i want to revert the change?
2010-03-04T17:49:00.000Z	VCoolio	zetheroo	sure, but maybe add another line with just "exec=" to be sure
2010-03-04T17:50:00.000Z	zetheroo	VCoolio	oh yes ... good idea
2010-03-04T17:54:00.000Z	zetheroo	VCoolio	you guys must spend so much time with Linux to know it so well inside and out ... my hats off to you ... i have been using Ubuntu as my main OS for 4 years and still cannot seem to catch up ... ha
2010-03-04T17:56:00.000Z	VCoolio	zetheroo	nah, it's just something lots of people want to configure, so this is a FAQ
2010-03-04T17:56:00.000Z	zetheroo	VCoolio	I see ... are people like me an whine about having to do it through the command line?
2010-03-04T17:57:00.000Z	VCoolio	zetheroo	in this case, no; but cli is very convenient: you get explanations and useful error messages most of the time
2010-03-04T18:01:00.000Z	zetheroo	VCoolio	agreed ... I just have a number of clients who I have switched from Windows to Ubuntu who are not too pleased when i tell them they have to resort to the terminal to do something so seemingly simple ... this is the main reason I groan ... not because I myself mind all that much, in fact i rather enjoy the command line, but because I am thinking of the greater group of users ... :)
2010-03-04T18:02:00.000Z	VCoolio	zetheroo	those client should maybe stick with LTS releases; karmic has some new stuff that isn't completely configurable / packed with features yet
2010-03-04T18:03:00.000Z	zetheroo	VCoolio	yes, about a quarter of them are still using Hardy ... but the remainder want the latest whenever they can get it ... hehe ...
