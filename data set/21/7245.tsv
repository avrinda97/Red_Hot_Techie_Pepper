2007-09-12T09:03:00.000Z	akio	nickrud	if i tried getting a shell it is extremely limited
2007-09-12T09:03:00.000Z	akio	nickrud	it seems to be hooked up properly, although i cant try and ping from where i am at this point
2007-09-12T08:56:00.000Z	akio	nickrud	can you help me with a pxe install?
2007-09-12T08:57:00.000Z	nickrud	akio	never done a pxe , but if its only sources you need, I can probably help with that
2007-09-12T08:57:00.000Z	nickrud	akio	where abouts are you living? country, I mean
2007-09-12T08:58:00.000Z	akio	nickrud	got any tips?
2007-09-12T08:58:00.000Z	nickrud	akio	a sec fone
2007-09-12T09:00:00.000Z	nickrud	akio	if all it's asking is a url, I'd assume that http://us.archive.ubuntu.com would suffice
2007-09-12T09:01:00.000Z	akio	nickrud	im at the point where its asking for an archive server
2007-09-12T09:02:00.000Z	akio	nickrud	it says please enter the directory in which the mirror of the ubuntu archive is located
2007-09-12T09:02:00.000Z	nickrud	akio	ah,
2007-09-12T09:04:00.000Z	nickrud	akio	try  dists/feisty  the the directory
2007-09-12T09:05:00.000Z	akio	nickrud	tried /ubuntu/dists/dapper
2007-09-12T09:05:00.000Z	nickrud	akio	that is the path
2007-09-12T09:07:00.000Z	nickrud	akio	lik I said, I've never done a pxe install so I'm pretty much just stabbing in the dark here.
2007-09-12T09:25:00.000Z	akio	nickrud	is there a better channel for pxe?
2007-09-12T09:27:00.000Z	nickrud	akio	I don't know, really. I do know that people who know it in their sleep come thru here
2007-09-12T10:17:00.000Z	akio	nickrud	i found out how to do a pxe install
2007-09-12T10:17:00.000Z	nickrud	akio	what was the problem, oh ;)
2007-09-12T10:18:00.000Z	nickrud	akio	ah, breezy image I bet
