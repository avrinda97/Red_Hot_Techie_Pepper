2005-10-18T05:31:00.000Z	mustard5		hi dloal
2005-10-18T05:33:00.000Z	mustard5		ah thanks theine
2005-10-18T05:33:00.000Z	theine	mustard5	i always use bash_completion if i know how the package name starts...
2005-10-18T05:34:00.000Z	mustard5	theine	ah....!  I'll try that
2005-11-01T08:53:00.000Z	theine	mustard5	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2005-11-01T08:53:00.000Z	mustard5	theine	thats it ;)
2005-11-01T08:54:00.000Z	theine	mustard5	xserver-xorg is an actual name of a package
2005-11-01T08:54:00.000Z	mustard5	theine	will that redo the xorg.conf?
2005-11-01T08:54:00.000Z	theine	mustard5	only if you haven't modified it manually
2005-11-01T08:55:00.000Z	theine	mustard5	i.e. edited it
2005-11-01T08:56:00.000Z	theine	mustard5	even if you did, there's information in the header if /etc/X11/xorg.conf on how to get a fresh dpkg-reconfigured xorg.conf
2005-11-01T08:56:00.000Z	mustard5	theine	if it was edited can you delete it and reconfigure..just courious
2005-11-01T08:56:00.000Z	theine	mustard5	that'll probably work as well, but i'm not sure
2005-11-01T08:57:00.000Z	mustard5	theine	I'll avoid that choice for now
2005-11-06T09:56:00.000Z	mustard5	theine	if you turn your firewall off, you get better hits on seach function in gtk-gnutella
2005-11-06T09:57:00.000Z	theine	mustard5	unfortunately i am behind a router over which I don't have any control but i'll try at my university
2005-11-06T09:58:00.000Z	mustard5	theine	yeah..thats unfortunate..I don't think using limewire or others will improve that...the firewall just maked it harder to do peer to peer
2005-11-06T10:15:00.000Z	mustard5	theine	would that require reinstallation of nvidia drivers?
2005-11-06T10:16:00.000Z	theine	mustard5	hmmm, don't really know
2005-11-06T10:19:00.000Z	theine	mustard5	by the way, i guess the nvidia kernel driver for 686 is in linux-restricted-modules-686
2005-11-06T10:19:00.000Z	mustard5	theine	roger that
