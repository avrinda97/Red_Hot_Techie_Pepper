2008-08-30T22:22:00.000Z	tensei		is there anyway to turn off the auto anchoring non-maximized windows do to the 4 edges of the desktop in ubuntu 8.04?
2008-08-30T22:22:00.000Z	RB2	tensei	with Compiz enabled?
2008-08-30T22:22:00.000Z	tensei	RB2	I'm sorry, I don't know what Compiz is.
2008-08-30T22:23:00.000Z	RB2	tensei	all the special effects: wobbly windows, etc. etc.
2008-08-30T22:24:00.000Z	tensei	RB2	I suppose i have those enabled.. so I guess yes.
2008-08-30T22:25:00.000Z	RB2	tensei	you want to install compizconfig-settings-manager, so in a terminal, put: sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
2008-08-30T22:26:00.000Z	tensei	RB2	done
2008-08-30T22:28:00.000Z	RB2	tensei	now you will have an Item under System > Preferences called "Advanced Desktop Effects Settings".
2008-08-30T22:28:00.000Z	RB2	tensei	you can control all of the effects from there. It's near the bottom and called "Snapping Windows". You can disable it there
2008-08-30T22:29:00.000Z	tensei	RB2	who made compizConfig?
2008-08-30T22:29:00.000Z	RB2	tensei	and as a bonus, you get to play with all the effects. :)
2008-08-30T22:30:00.000Z	RB2	tensei	probably the compiz guys? Not sure really.
2008-08-30T22:30:00.000Z	tensei	RB2	it just seems odd to me that there wouldn't be a preference in the OS that would let you change the effects it does without a 3rd party program..
2008-08-30T22:32:00.000Z	RB2	tensei	I agree it's strange that it does not install by default if you have the HW to support it, but it can be added/removed like any other component of Ubuntu.
2008-08-30T22:32:00.000Z	RB2		How do I go about re-installed my binary driver for NVidia?
2008-08-30T22:32:00.000Z	RB2		Everytime I enable it, it hoses X
2008-08-30T22:33:00.000Z	RB2	tensei	did that fix your sticky window problem?
2008-08-30T22:35:00.000Z	tensei	RB2	Absolutely, thanks a bunch.. I like to keep my windows almost all the way maximized because i have have a 22" widescreen lcd, but i like to see a little back ground, which makes it really annoying.  Also, I like the onmouseover the windows automatically popping up.. so i have a lot of windows close together, close to the edge.. so it was a pain
2008-08-30T22:35:00.000Z	RB2	tensei	I can understand that. Getting 'rid of those snapping windows was my FIRST order of business! :D
2008-08-30T22:40:00.000Z	tensei	RB2	hey, also, when I open a window it loads in the top left corner of the screen, is there anyway to turn that off so it loads to wherever it was last closed?  you know what I'm saying?
2008-08-30T22:41:00.000Z	RB2	tensei	I've never had that issue before. Hmmmm....
