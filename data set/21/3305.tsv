2009-02-16T21:28:00.000Z	Baatti		My wireless has stopped picking up signals after someone came to our house and gave us a new modem and set us up for Comcast Digital Phone Service. Wireless was previously working with the ath5k fix...I've run through the procedure to set that up again and it still won't work
2009-02-16T21:28:00.000Z	Baatti		anyone?
2009-02-16T21:28:00.000Z	Baatti		please?
2009-02-16T21:29:00.000Z	yownanymous	Baatti	Otherwise known as Wubi... ;)
2009-02-16T21:32:00.000Z	yownanymous	Baatti	actually it sets up a virtual disk which ubuntu thinks is a partition
2009-02-16T21:32:00.000Z	yownanymous	Baatti	indeed, a real operating system run on the idea of a virtual machine
2009-02-16T21:33:00.000Z	Baatti	yownanymous	can you try and hlep me fix my wireless?
2009-02-16T21:33:00.000Z	yownanymous	Baatti	what's up with  it?
2009-02-16T21:34:00.000Z	Baatti	yownanymous	I was previously using the ath5k fix, everything was working fine. But now someone came to the house to install Comcast Digital Phone service, and gave us a new modem..now my wireless won't work
2009-02-16T21:34:00.000Z	Baatti	yownanymous	I've followed the original steps to try and set up ath5k again, still not working
2009-02-16T21:34:00.000Z	yownanymous	Baatti	 erm... Have you contacted Comcast about it?
2009-02-16T21:35:00.000Z	Baatti	yownanymous	nay, my father's Vista is working just fine. He didn't have to change anything on his computer
2009-02-16T21:35:00.000Z	yownanymous	Baatti	that's an odd one, can you give me some specs for you and your dad's computer then?
2009-02-16T21:35:00.000Z	Baatti	yownanymous	what kind of specs?
2009-02-16T21:36:00.000Z	yownanymous	Baatti	well most particularly
2009-02-16T21:36:00.000Z	Baatti	yownanymous	hrm, I'm using Atheros 5007 I believe
2009-02-16T21:36:00.000Z	yownanymous	Baatti	ah, infamous atheros
2009-02-16T21:37:00.000Z	Baatti	yownanymous	aye
2009-02-16T21:37:00.000Z	yownanymous	Baatti	well I'm not very good with telecom technology so I probably can't help, sorry
2009-02-16T21:38:00.000Z	Baatti	yownanymous	its ok, thanks for the attempt, looks like I've grabbed the attention of a few others anyway
2009-02-16T21:38:00.000Z	yownanymous	Baatti	what about a kernel update or something? it might work
