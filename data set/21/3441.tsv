2009-07-05T14:12:00.000Z	joaopinto	wolter	man wget, and yes, it should be capital
2009-07-05T14:12:00.000Z	wolter	joaopinto	no
2009-07-05T14:12:00.000Z	wolter	joaopinto	test it yourself
2009-07-05T14:12:00.000Z	joaopinto	wolter	random guesses are not very helpful, please read the manpages instread
2009-07-05T14:12:00.000Z	joaopinto	wolter	is not about testing, is about reading the command documentation, man wget
2009-07-05T14:13:00.000Z	joaopinto	wolter	just because something works it does not mean it is being propery used
2009-07-05T14:13:00.000Z	wolter	joaopinto	in the long run the manual is to get precise results
2009-07-05T14:13:00.000Z	wolter	joaopinto	why is it not properly used when it works?
2009-07-05T14:14:00.000Z	wolter	joaopinto	and who said it had to be capital?
2009-07-05T14:14:00.000Z	joaopinto	wolter	because it may just work on whatever conditions you are trying, and not in general,
2009-07-05T14:14:00.000Z	joaopinto	wolter	read the man, you will notice the capital "-O" there
2009-07-05T14:14:00.000Z	wolter	joaopinto	look at the first example in man wget after OPTIONS Option Syntax
2009-07-05T14:14:00.000Z	wolter	joaopinto	it has lowercase o
2009-07-05T14:14:00.000Z	wolter	joaopinto	you read it
2009-07-05T14:15:00.000Z	joaopinto	wolter	stop being anoying and read the maual carefully, -o is different from -O, -o is for logfile output, while -O is for the download output !!!
2009-07-05T14:16:00.000Z	wolter	joaopinto	thats just a formality
2009-07-05T14:16:00.000Z	joaopinto	wolter	ITS NOT !!!!
2009-07-05T14:16:00.000Z	wolter	joaopinto	output is output in the end
2009-07-05T14:17:00.000Z	joaopinto	wolter	well, I am not wasting more time with you, since you can't understand between the command log output, and the download output, neither you know how to read a manpage, and apparently you don't care about it
2009-07-05T14:17:00.000Z	wolter	joaopinto	wget http://bambox.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Preview.png -o Desktop/image.png
2009-07-05T14:24:00.000Z	wolter	joaopinto	he wants to compile it
