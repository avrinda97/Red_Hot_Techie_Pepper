2010-05-02T05:33:00.000Z	ratcheer	THE_GFR|WORK	sudo service start cups
2010-05-02T05:35:00.000Z	THE_GFR|WORK	ratcheer	how do I get it to auto-start?
2010-05-02T05:36:00.000Z	ratcheer	THE_GFR|WORK	There are many ways. The easiest is probably to install package bum, then run it under sudo, and set cups to run.
2010-05-02T05:37:00.000Z	THE_GFR|WORK	ratcheer	why was it uninstalled when I upgraded from 9.10 to 10.04?
