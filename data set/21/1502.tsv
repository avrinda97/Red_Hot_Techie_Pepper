2010-10-24T09:03:00.000Z	Gunni		hey someone, i disabled the mousepad on my laptop with FN+F7, and it doesn't work turning it back on, can someone help?
2010-10-24T09:04:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Gunni	so that key combo doesn't turn it back on...?  you may just have to reboot.
2010-10-24T09:05:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Gunni	it won't re-enable after a reboot!?!
2010-10-24T09:05:00.000Z	Gunni	arrrghhh	reboot or button doesnt work
2010-10-24T09:05:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Gunni	there isn't a button to turn it on & off?  do  you have another OS insatlled?
2010-10-24T09:05:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Gunni	not sure.  you're completely up-to-date?  10.10?
2010-10-24T09:07:00.000Z	Gunni	arrrghhh	yes it's weird
2010-10-24T09:07:00.000Z	Gunni	arrrghhh	when i press the fn+f7 i see onscreen message that it's enabled/disabled but it doesnt do anything
2010-10-24T09:08:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Gunni	what laptop make/model?
2010-10-24T09:11:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Gunni	have you tried suspending to RAM?
2010-10-24T09:11:00.000Z	Gunni	arrrghhh	what's that?
2010-10-24T09:11:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Gunni	i have another couple of commands to try as well.
2010-10-24T09:12:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Gunni	try these - http://pastebin.com/UxXTQcHW
2010-10-24T09:13:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Gunni	ok suspend to RAM then - just regular suspend i believe...
2010-10-24T09:15:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Gunni	you're trying to re-enable it every time as well, yes?  clicking buttons, fn+f7, any hardware switches or buttons that turn it on or off...?
2010-10-24T09:17:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Gunni	ok here's another.  drop to a terminal with 'ctrl-alt-f1'.  then go back to gui with 'ctrl-alt-f7'
2010-10-24T09:18:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Gunni	hrm.  well all these tips seem to be for old versions of ubuntu... here's another - http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=8277015&postcount=15
2010-10-24T09:22:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Gunni	it seems everyone online just 'accidently' turns it off... crap.
2010-10-24T09:23:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Gunni	you have to hit esc i believe.
2010-10-24T09:28:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Gunni	that grub edit fixed it?
2010-10-24T09:30:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Gunni	i got that from a 30 second google search...
