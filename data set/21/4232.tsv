2008-07-26T18:19:00.000Z	smellynoser	firsm	Or ftp.heanet.ie, yes
2008-07-26T18:15:00.000Z	firsm	smellynoser	gateway in /etc/network/interfaces
2008-07-26T18:15:00.000Z	smellynoser	firsm	Thankyou
2008-07-26T18:16:00.000Z	firsm	smellynoser	if you want it to do with route then it's, route del -net default gw 192.... && route add -net default gw 192.168.5.5
2008-07-26T18:17:00.000Z	smellynoser	firsm	I still keep getting: "No route to host" type messages
2008-07-26T18:18:00.000Z	firsm	smellynoser	what host are you trying to reach?
2008-07-26T18:18:00.000Z	smellynoser	firsm	ftp.heanet.ie
2008-07-26T18:18:00.000Z	smellynoser	firsm	It's a VPN server, and when I connect my client the logs of the VPN server say: "no route to host"
2008-07-26T18:19:00.000Z	firsm	smellynoser	so the vpn server doesn't know how to route to your machine at home?
2008-07-26T18:19:00.000Z	smellynoser	firsm	It gets the correct IP for ftp.heanet.ie, but just doesn't know how to connect to it I believe
2008-07-26T18:20:00.000Z	firsm	smellynoser	then it'd say connection refused or something like that
2008-07-26T18:21:00.000Z	smellynoser	firsm	My route list has two default routes now that I restarted networking
2008-07-26T18:22:00.000Z	firsm	smellynoser	be careful chaning routes on that sever :-)
2008-07-26T18:22:00.000Z	smellynoser	firsm	It's a virtual machine, so if I mess up the networking I can still get in (luckily) :D
2008-07-26T18:25:00.000Z	firsm	smellynoser	bridge setups are always a little complex, make sure the network interface br0 is bridged to (ethx) doesn't have an ip at all. Instead, give that ip to the bridge
2008-07-26T18:25:00.000Z	firsm	smellynoser	however, just logging into the vpn server should work without a bridge - so, can you reach your home host from inside your vpn VM?
2008-07-26T18:27:00.000Z	smellynoser	firsm	I can't ping my domain, so the ftp.heanet.ie IP is probably cached locally?
2008-07-26T18:28:00.000Z	firsm	smellynoser	mmh, you're confusing me. :-) Can you reach the host you are trying to connect to the vpn server from the vpn server?
2008-07-26T18:29:00.000Z	smellynoser	firsm	No I can't :( I can't ping my machine, or ssh
2008-07-26T18:30:00.000Z	firsm	smellynoser	I guess you neet to fix the routing on your vpn server then
2008-07-26T18:31:00.000Z	firsm	smellynoser	just restart that vm :-)
