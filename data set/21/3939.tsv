2008-08-17T03:04:00.000Z	TheClam		Hiya - can someone please tell me why my system with a netgear ma401 card shows up two interfaces, wlan0 and wifi0, both with the same MAC and crypto settings?
2008-08-17T03:05:00.000Z	usser	TheClam	wifi0 is an internally used interface, just ignore it
2008-08-17T03:05:00.000Z	TheClam	usser	it's stuffing things up, I can't ignore it. ARP entries get tied to it and I then can't communicate with those hosts
2008-08-17T03:07:00.000Z	TheClam	usser	i.e. I just rebooted it and though it associated with the AP, I couldn't ping it... go on the console and it's got a correct ARP against wlan0 and an incomplete against wifi0. Down and up wifi0 and all's good, but you need local access to do that
2008-08-17T03:08:00.000Z	usser	TheClam	thats strange wifi0 usually doesnt interfere
2008-08-17T03:08:00.000Z	TheClam	usser	it's a real pain in the behind!
2008-08-17T03:09:00.000Z	TheClam	usser	best I can think of to do is maybe a post-up... but it's not that predictable, some boots it just works :o\
2008-08-17T03:09:00.000Z	usser	TheClam	im not sure that wifi0 is really your problem there
2008-08-17T03:10:00.000Z	TheClam	usser	what else could it be? if I down and up wifi0 all my problems go away
2008-08-17T03:11:00.000Z	usser	TheClam	right, right it might be it after all, check this out https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WiFiHowTo
2008-08-17T03:12:00.000Z	usser	TheClam	search the page for wifi0
2008-08-17T03:14:00.000Z	TheClam	usser	I tried blacklisting hostap stuff earlier and it didn't create wifi0... but not wlan0 either. I followed a different method, though, so will try this now....
2008-08-17T03:18:00.000Z	TheClam	usser	just rebooting that box now... soon see if it kills or cures :)
2008-08-17T03:18:00.000Z	usser	TheClam	hehe
2008-08-17T03:20:00.000Z	TheClam	usser	no dice... though I still have both interfaces so I guess it didn't do anything (apart from add a weird little triangle after my ESSID)
2008-08-17T03:21:00.000Z	TheClam	usser	erm, hold fire, may have pasted that in the wrong box
2008-08-17T03:26:00.000Z	TheClam		while I'm in here, anyone know how to make middle button in firefox open the url in the cut buffer rather than bring up that windows-style scroller widget?
2008-08-17T03:29:00.000Z	TheClam	usser	still the same... I've exhausted my imagination as far as search keywords go... should I just bin the NIC or what?
2008-08-17T03:30:00.000Z	TheClam	usser	though this machine uses a linksys, which is not free of problems. The GUI configuration tool didn't work on either box
2008-08-17T03:33:00.000Z	usser	TheClam	i dunno what to tell u, i tried removing wifi0 myself but after ubuntu info reassured me its normal i kinda stopped trying
2008-08-17T03:34:00.000Z	TheClam	usser	cheers for the help. I guess it's just one of those annoying things! Hopefully will be phasing that machine out once I get qmail running on this one anyway
