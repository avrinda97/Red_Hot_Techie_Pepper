2008-10-07T19:48:00.000Z	Gnea	jim_p	no big deal, just wanted to make sure that you were aware of the correct process. :)
2008-10-07T19:44:00.000Z	Gnea	jim_p	incorrect.
2008-10-07T19:44:00.000Z	jim_p	Gnea	???
2008-10-07T19:44:00.000Z	Gnea	jim_p	the kernel doesn't determine what shows up in lspci, the pci ID database does.
2008-10-07T19:45:00.000Z	jim_p	Gnea	newer kernel , newer database
2008-10-07T19:45:00.000Z	Gnea	jim_p	wrong.
2008-10-07T19:45:00.000Z	Gnea	jim_p	the pci id database is independent of the kernel.
2008-10-07T19:46:00.000Z	jim_p	Gnea	ok i quit
2008-10-14T21:19:00.000Z	jim_p	Gnea	how did you manage to get OOo 3 to work in hardy??
2008-10-14T21:20:00.000Z	Gnea	jim_p	downloaded the deb tarball, installed them
2008-10-14T21:20:00.000Z	Gnea	jim_p	yes, OOo 3 final.
2008-10-14T21:20:00.000Z	Gnea	jim_p	the website is /.'d, but they have a link to the torrents - much faster
2008-10-14T21:21:00.000Z	jim_p	Gnea	where is that .deb?!?!?!
2008-10-14T21:21:00.000Z	Gnea	jim_p	openoffice.org :P
2008-10-14T21:23:00.000Z	jim_p	Gnea	is this a .deb INSIDE a .tar.gz?
2008-10-14T21:24:00.000Z	Gnea	jim_p	yeah, you have to untar it then do a dpkg -i *.deb
2008-10-14T21:24:00.000Z	jim_p	Gnea	thanks a lot!!! when will a greek one reach the repos?
2008-10-14T21:25:00.000Z	Gnea	jim_p	do I look like an OOo developer? ;)
2008-10-14T21:25:00.000Z	jim_p	Gnea	lmao!!! no i was just asking
2009-01-23T12:28:00.000Z	jim_p	Gnea	apt-file? but it will take ages to update its db before searching
2009-01-23T12:29:00.000Z	Gnea	jim_p	not worried about it taking awhile
