2006-07-27T06:53:00.000Z	DewDude		it obviously is of no help
2006-07-27T06:53:00.000Z	DewDude		which is what really got me..angry
2006-07-27T06:54:00.000Z	DewDude		but anyway..i'm heading outside
2006-07-27T06:54:00.000Z	DewDude		i tried those too

2006-07-27T06:55:00.000Z	DewDude		i can't get into the thing because i don't have a password
2006-07-27T06:55:00.000Z	DewDude		or i don't know what it is
2006-07-27T06:55:00.000Z	beefsprocket	DewDude	mysql has no root password by default...
2006-07-27T06:56:00.000Z	beefsprocket	DewDude	have you tried su - and then runningsimply "mysql" ?
2006-07-27T06:57:00.000Z	beefsprocket	DewDude	yeah
2006-07-27T06:57:00.000Z	beefsprocket	DewDude	and then run just mysql, no options
2006-07-27T06:58:00.000Z	DewDude	beefsprocket	you want me to stop it and then restart the daemon
2006-07-27T06:58:00.000Z	beefsprocket	DewDude	you could, though it shouldn't matter
2006-07-27T07:00:00.000Z	beefsprocket	DewDude	this is just a guess, but you could also try copying a password from /etc/shadow for your user to the mysql line
2006-07-27T07:00:00.000Z	beefsprocket	DewDude	that might actually work well
2006-07-27T07:01:00.000Z	beefsprocket	DewDude	?
2006-07-27T07:03:00.000Z	beefsprocket	DewDude	actually you can set the passowrd using "sudo passwd mysql"
2006-07-27T07:03:00.000Z	DewDude	beefsprocket	umm...that would set the password for the user mysql
