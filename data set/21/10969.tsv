2006-04-29T16:15:00.000Z	pitti	newadmin	can you please look for a similar bug on https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/cupsys/+bugs, and if there is no such bug yet, file one?
2006-04-29T16:16:00.000Z	pitti	newadmin	you are on dapper, right?
2006-04-29T16:18:00.000Z	pitti	newadmin	so, please open a bug and attach your /etc/cups/cupsd.conf and the error_log
2006-04-29T16:18:00.000Z	pitti	newadmin	you can revert to the previous version for now to repair it for you
2006-04-29T16:18:00.000Z	pitti	newadmin	but I'd like to fix it in the current version
2006-04-29T16:19:00.000Z	pitti	newadmin	oh,  could you try to remove and re-add the printer?
2006-04-29T16:24:00.000Z	pitti	newadmin	I need more specific information, like your configuratoin file and error_log, and what 'yelling' is in particluar :)
2006-04-29T16:25:00.000Z	pitti	newadmin	just attach them to the bug report
2006-04-29T16:26:00.000Z	pitti	newadmin	https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/cupsys/+filebug
2006-04-29T16:28:00.000Z	pitti	newadmin	this is a generic 'binary' mime type, there's no driver for it
2006-04-29T16:37:00.000Z	pitti	newadmin	thanks
2006-04-29T16:38:00.000Z	pitti	newadmin	so, 'sudo dpkg -i /var/cache/apt/archives/cupsys_1.1.99.b1.r4929-0ubuntu9_*.deb' reverts to the previous version, btw
2006-04-29T16:39:00.000Z	pitti	newadmin	that looks good :)
2006-04-29T16:40:00.000Z	pitti	newadmin	hm, seems you need to downgrade (i. e. install) libcups*.deb and cupsys-client*.deb as well
2006-04-29T16:45:00.000Z	pitti	newadmin	heh, no problem; the real problem will be to fix it for the 1.2rc2 version
