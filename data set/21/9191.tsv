2006-08-08T16:16:00.000Z	chedabob		hey
2006-08-08T16:16:00.000Z	chedabob		i have a problem
2006-08-08T16:17:00.000Z	chedabob		are there known issues with Gaim and Dapper Drake? cos im using the preinstalled version of gaim, and my buddy list is displayed, but then Gaim just disappears, theres no icon on the taskbar
2006-08-08T16:18:00.000Z	chedabob		i did an update for Dapper, and its only started since then. the version that comes with the install cd works fine
2006-08-08T16:19:00.000Z	chedabob		furry: yeah, didnt help. i tried the autopackage version aswell, cos that wasnt a CVS version
2006-08-08T16:19:00.000Z	chedabob		is there a way to "downgrade" to the version on the install cd?
2006-08-08T16:20:00.000Z	mneptok	chedabob	have you tried moving ~/.gaim aside?
2006-08-08T16:20:00.000Z	chedabob		woah hold on, im a n00b towards linux :P
2006-08-08T16:21:00.000Z	mneptok	chedabob	is GAIM running?
2006-08-08T16:21:00.000Z	chedabob		nope
2006-08-08T16:21:00.000Z	chedabob		it quits as soon as i open it
2006-08-08T16:21:00.000Z	mneptok	chedabob	open a terminal and type "mv .gaim gaim-old"
2006-08-08T16:21:00.000Z	mneptok		then try launching again
2006-08-08T16:22:00.000Z	chedabob		my buddy list displays, then it disappears, theres nothing on the taskbar. it seems that the current version doesnt like my system, cos i had Hoary on yesterday, and as soon as i upgraded, the same error occured
2006-08-08T16:22:00.000Z	chedabob		Hi
2006-08-08T16:22:00.000Z	chedabob	mneptok	i typed that, now what?
2006-08-08T16:22:00.000Z	mneptok	chedabob	try launching GAIM
2006-08-08T16:23:00.000Z	chedabob	mneptok	that seemed to work. its not shut yet
2006-08-08T16:24:00.000Z	mneptok	chedabob	then the problem was something in your user settings for GAIM. do you log your IM sessions?
2006-08-08T16:25:00.000Z	chedabob		ok next problem: my memory card reader isnt recognised at all, with or without a card in. it worked before, but then i formatted the memory card on another pc, and its stopped
2006-08-08T16:25:00.000Z	mneptok	chedabob	did you format it as FAT32?
