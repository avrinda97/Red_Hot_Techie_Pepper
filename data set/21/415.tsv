2012-01-08T12:47:00.000Z	aaschez		I want to re-install system. What kind of partitioning scheme should I follow? For a 320 GB HDD, is this fine - / 10GB, /var - 10GB, /usr - 10GB, swap - 5GB and rest to /home ?
2012-01-08T12:47:00.000Z	llutz_	aaschez	extra /usr makes no sense imho
2012-01-08T12:48:00.000Z	aaschez	llutz_	extra /usr ?? I used /, /var, /usr, /home, swap
2012-01-08T12:48:00.000Z	llutz_	aaschez	why separate /usr? you cannot mount it ro anymore, so where is the benefit of it?
2012-01-08T12:52:00.000Z	aaschez	llutz_	I consider splitting /var off usually. I'm thinking of having /usr. Afaik, /usr got most of the OS. So having /,/var,/home better?  Because /usr doesn't overflow so much? But /usr is probably the biggest partition other than /home.
2012-01-08T12:53:00.000Z	llutz_	aaschez	having /usr on extra partition makes no sense to  me at all anymore. consider moving /tmp to prevent / from being filled
2012-01-08T12:54:00.000Z	aaschez	llutz_	How does  separate /var helps
2012-01-08T12:55:00.000Z	llutz_	aaschez	/var hold logs which might increase unexpected and other temporary data. so it might be a good idea to have it extra
2012-01-08T12:56:00.000Z	aaschez	llutz_	So should I have /, /var, /tmp, /home only?
2012-01-08T12:56:00.000Z	llutz_	aaschez	that's what i'd suggest
2012-01-08T12:57:00.000Z	aaschez	llutz_	How much space  should I assign to / , /var , /tmp ?
2012-01-08T13:00:00.000Z	llutz_	aaschez	that depends on your usage.
2012-01-08T13:07:00.000Z	aaschez	llutz_	What should be the minimum space atleast?
2012-01-08T13:08:00.000Z	aaschez	llutz_	My usage includes, CAD, matlab, physics simulation and coding.
2012-01-08T13:08:00.000Z	llutz_	aaschez	10G for /, 5+ for /var, same for /tmp. but as i said, it depends on your usage
2012-01-08T13:08:00.000Z	aaschez	llutz_	Ok, thanks
2012-01-08T13:09:00.000Z	aaschez	llutz_	And what about assigning /tmp specifically for server installtion as StepNjump  was saying. Is it requirted for desktop installtions?
2012-01-08T13:10:00.000Z	llutz_	aaschez	to make sure that /tmp wouldn't fill / it makes sense. on servers it has some other advantages, as you might mount /tmp ro,nodev,noexec,nosuid.
2012-01-08T14:05:00.000Z	aaschez	llutz_	That's what made me wonder how /tmp can cause no boting
2012-01-08T15:26:00.000Z	llutz_	aaschez	do you try to chroot into 64bit install from 32bit livecd?
2012-01-13T13:10:00.000Z	llutz_	aaschez	the boot * just means, that partitions bootable flag is set.
