2012-06-17T16:10:00.000Z	Wheemp		So no one had any suggestions on my case? :/
2012-06-17T16:11:00.000Z	genii-around	Wheemp	Do you have another machine handy which DOES have a cd drive?
2012-06-17T16:11:00.000Z	Wheemp	genii-around	Yes

2012-06-17T16:12:00.000Z	Wheemp	genii-around	but i wont start to install a tftpd..
2012-06-17T16:12:00.000Z	genii-around	Wheemp	You can install things to the livecd desktop, like pxe boot server
2012-06-17T16:14:00.000Z	Wheemp	genii-around	Im not able to use another computer to install it. Setting up server's etc wasn't what i was looking for..
2012-06-17T16:15:00.000Z	genii-around	Wheemp	What is currently on the machine, Windows?
2012-06-17T16:17:00.000Z	genii-around	Wheemp	eg: you can do the wubi installer from inside Windows, then migrate it to an actual partition
2012-06-17T16:18:00.000Z	Wheemp	genii-around	3 500gb RAID 5 HDD's
2012-06-17T16:18:00.000Z	Wheemp	genii-around	nothing on them
2012-06-17T16:18:00.000Z	Wheemp		brand new
2012-06-17T16:18:00.000Z	Wheemp	genii-around	i thought i would try out ubuntu server version instead of just running debian but it looks like i will skip that part soon..
2012-06-17T16:20:00.000Z	genii-around	Wheemp	With no OS on it, and the usb being flaky I think your best bet here is still to do the PXE booting from a second machine, which is hosting the cd rom to install from ( or acting as an apt-proxy)
2012-06-17T16:21:00.000Z	Wheemp	genii-around	Any clue why USB installation is even recommended when it seems like it actually not working? it works fine on machine with an CD-ROM even if you don't use it
2012-06-17T16:21:00.000Z	Wheemp	genii-around	but for R servers etc it works like shit, since you can't install it
2012-06-17T16:22:00.000Z	genii-around	Wheemp	A lot of times it depends on the individual machine's bios, or sometimes if it was an iso that got converted something went wrong and it still oooks for a cd drive etc.
2012-06-17T16:23:00.000Z	Wheemp	genii-around	tried like 5 different iso to usb programs but it still give the same error.. same with different computers
2012-06-17T16:23:00.000Z	Wheemp		Ah well, im going back to things i know work..
2012-06-17T16:23:00.000Z	Wheemp		thanks for help
2012-06-17T16:23:00.000Z	genii-around	Wheemp	Did you check the md5sum? PErhaps original iso download was bad
