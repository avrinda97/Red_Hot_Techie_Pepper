2008-09-21T08:06:00.000Z	phuzion		I have two machines, both of which are secured with good passwords, but both are shared environments as well.  How safe would it be to use a shared key without a passphrase to authenticate between these two machines?
2008-09-21T08:06:00.000Z	Nallep	phuzion	does anyone else have access to your machines?
2008-09-21T08:07:00.000Z	phuzion	Nallep	yes, they are shared environments.
2008-09-21T08:07:00.000Z	phuzion	Nallep	some users have sudo, most do not though
2008-09-21T08:08:00.000Z	Nallep	phuzion	if you trust the users who do have sudo to not screw around with your other machine, then it should be fine as long as you turn off read permissions for others
2008-09-21T08:09:00.000Z	Nallep	phuzion	but if you can't trust the super users, then keep your keys passworded and use ssh-agent
2008-09-21T08:09:00.000Z	phuzion	Nallep	I feel like I can trust them, but the thing is I need a way to have this automated.  It's for a nightly backup script
2008-09-21T08:10:00.000Z	phuzion		Which will be handled with cron job
2008-09-21T08:10:00.000Z	phuzion		a cron job*
2008-09-21T08:10:00.000Z	Nallep	phuzion	look into making ssh keys that can only execute one command then log out
2008-09-21T08:11:00.000Z	phuzion	Nallep	Like, a specific command, or just any one command?
2008-09-21T08:13:00.000Z	Nallep	phuzion	a specific command, you can setup a key to login and only execute a specified command
2008-09-21T08:13:00.000Z	phuzion	Nallep	Awesome, thanks.  I'll look into it.
2008-09-21T08:13:00.000Z	Nallep	phuzion	make a script on the server to do your build and transfer files, then have the ssh key run that script
2008-09-21T08:15:00.000Z	phuzion		Alright, thanks Nallep
2008-09-21T08:17:00.000Z	phuzion	Nallep	so, what you're saying is one script to make the backup files, one script to send the files off, and one script to execute the file sending?  third script executes second, which executes the first
2008-09-21T08:17:00.000Z	phuzion		And the third script is called in with cron
2008-09-21T08:18:00.000Z	Nallep	phuzion	well depends on what your doing, I'd just put it all in one script and execute it all at once
2008-09-21T08:18:00.000Z	phuzion		Alright, I'll see what I can dig up on Google.  Thanks for the help, Nal
2008-09-21T08:19:00.000Z	phuzion		Nallep*
2008-09-21T08:34:00.000Z	Nallep	phuzion	look into the command option for your authorized_keys file (read man authorized_keys)
