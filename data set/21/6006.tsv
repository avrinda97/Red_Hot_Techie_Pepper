2007-06-20T16:40:00.000Z	theunixgeek	Sh3r1ff	i cant get the original ones, though
2007-06-20T16:40:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	theunixgeek	you should be able to change the system sounds there
2007-06-20T16:41:00.000Z	theunixgeek	Sh3r1ff	 i did sudo apt-get install ubuntustudio-desktop and i didnt like it too much. however, now as i log in, instead of doing a little drum sound when the login screen appears, it makes a different sound, and i'd like the original splash screen and startup sound back. how do i do that?
2007-06-20T16:41:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	theunixgeek	dpkg --purge ubuntustudio-desktop
2007-06-20T16:42:00.000Z	theunixgeek	Sh3r1ff	what does that do?
2007-06-20T16:42:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	theunixgeek	completely removes ubuntustudio-desktop
2007-06-20T16:44:00.000Z	theunixgeek	Sh3r1ff	doesnt seem to have done much :(
2007-06-20T16:46:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	theunixgeek	system, preferences, gnome control center, login window
2007-06-20T16:47:00.000Z	theunixgeek	Sh3r1ff	i dont see "gnome control center"
2007-06-20T16:47:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	theunixgeek	edit the menus, right click an applications and select edit menus, you can add it to the menu then
