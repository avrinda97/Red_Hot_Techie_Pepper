2010-05-25T15:06:00.000Z	Linuxrevolution		Can I install any software from Ubuntu Live CD ?
2010-05-25T15:08:00.000Z	geirha	Linuxrevolution	Not possible. The liveCD doesn't have openoffice packages.
2010-05-25T15:09:00.000Z	Linuxrevolution	geirha	but when u install ubuntu u have open office
2010-05-25T15:09:00.000Z	geirha	Linuxrevolution	Yes, it copies the files directly from the live session. There's no room for both packages and the live system.
2010-05-25T15:10:00.000Z	geirha	Linuxrevolution	The alternate cd has packages
2010-05-25T15:10:00.000Z	Linuxrevolution	geirha	yes it has but is there any way to extract LIVE CD ?
2010-05-25T15:11:00.000Z	geirha	Linuxrevolution	It's doable, but waay too much work if you ask me. Better to just download the packages ...
2010-05-25T15:11:00.000Z	Linuxrevolution	geirha	he can't download it
2010-05-25T15:11:00.000Z	Linuxrevolution	geirha	because of his slow connection
2010-05-25T15:13:00.000Z	Linuxrevolution	geirha	mate! he has not an internet connection
2010-05-25T15:14:00.000Z	geirha	Linuxrevolution	So download the packages elsewhere and put them on a CD/memory stick
2010-05-25T15:14:00.000Z	Linuxrevolution	geirha	ya this is the only way that he has
2010-05-25T15:15:00.000Z	geirha	Linuxrevolution	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Synaptic/PackageDownloadScript
2010-05-25T15:15:00.000Z	Linuxrevolution	geirha	but in software source / ubuntu software Tab
2010-05-25T15:15:00.000Z	Linuxrevolution	geirha	there is a source as: CDRom with ubuntu.... what's that?
2010-05-25T15:16:00.000Z	geirha	Linuxrevolution	The liveCD contains some packages, mostly hardware driver packages, but no openoffice packages.
2010-05-25T15:16:00.000Z	Linuxrevolution	geirha	aha got it
2010-05-25T15:17:00.000Z	Linuxrevolution	geirha	thanks a lot :)
2010-05-25T15:17:00.000Z	geirha	Linuxrevolution	You're welcome :)
