2009-02-03T08:48:00.000Z	ScottG489		When I try to install Google Gears in FireFox on ubuntu for getting Gmail emails off-line I get this error message ""Google Gears" could not be installed because it is not compatible with your Firefox build type (Linux_x86_64-gcc3). Please contact the author of this item about the problem."
2009-02-03T08:49:00.000Z	drash	ScottG489	looks like they don't offer a 64-bit version of google gears
2009-02-03T08:50:00.000Z	ScottG489	drash	So you think the problem is my 64-bit, not linux?
2009-02-03T08:51:00.000Z	drash	ScottG489	correct, I installed the 32-bit version to test offline gmail support and that does work on ubuntu intrepid
2009-02-03T08:52:00.000Z	ScottG489	drash	Is there a workaround I can use for 64-bit?
2009-02-03T08:53:00.000Z	drash	ScottG489	not that i know off sorry, never used anything 64-bit yet
2009-02-03T08:54:00.000Z	ScottG489	drash	hm, ok thanks anyways
2009-02-03T09:02:00.000Z	drash	ScottG489	have you seen http://nielspeen.com/blog/2009/02/google-gears-64-bit/ yet ? might do the trick ...
2009-02-03T09:06:00.000Z	ScottG489	drash	Thanks ill try it out. Right now I just use Evolution for email offline but I just kinda wanted to test it out.
2009-02-03T09:08:00.000Z	ScottG489	drash	How exactly does it work anyways? If I open up a browser and type in gmail.com it will still work but without any new emails?
2009-02-03T09:09:00.000Z	ScottG489	drash	Holy crap why is this download 4 gigs?
2009-02-03T09:10:00.000Z	drash	ScottG489	you'll have to put firefox into offline mode, and as soon it sees a working connection it will upload and sync your mails
2009-02-03T09:10:00.000Z	drash	ScottG489	4 GB ? dunno, but that sounds strange ...
2009-02-03T09:13:00.000Z	ScottG489	drash	Maybe I read it wrong or something...but it seems to have downloaded
2009-02-03T09:14:00.000Z	drash	ScottG489	according to several comments at http://www.techrecipes.net/linux/google-gears-in-64-bit-linux.html despite the error message you first reported, it does seem to work ... confusing indeed :)
2009-02-03T09:18:00.000Z	ScottG489	drash	Hey thanks so much
2009-02-03T09:18:00.000Z	drash	ScottG489	very welcome, hope it works for you
2009-02-03T09:20:00.000Z	ScottG489	drash	Curious as to where the desktop shortcut is added to since its not the desktop lol
2009-02-03T09:21:00.000Z	drash	ScottG489	you can always try to run the "locate gears" command (after updating the installed files database with "sudo updatedb"
2009-02-03T09:27:00.000Z	ScottG489	drash	Well that found where the extension is stored and such but how would that help find out where it saves Desktop Shortcuts that I create?
2009-02-03T09:29:00.000Z	drash	ScottG489	o sorry, misunderstood your question
