2008-04-02T13:35:00.000Z	negge^	noob-africa	what are you trying to do? I scrolled up a bit but couldn't find it
2008-04-02T13:36:00.000Z	negge^	noob-africa	 why do you want hidden sessions on your discs?
2008-04-02T13:36:00.000Z	noob-africa	negge^	am trying to append an appendable cd, masking the existing session, making the new session default... right now the existing session is not masked, and i am getting multiple sets of data
2008-04-02T13:36:00.000Z	noob-africa	negge^	which is pretty messy
2008-04-02T13:37:00.000Z	negge^	noob-africa	have you tried nero linux 3?
2008-04-02T13:42:00.000Z	negge^	noob-africa	how do you do what you want in Nero (in Windows)?
2008-04-02T13:45:00.000Z	noob-africa	negge^	well, with Nero in Win, you open up an appendable CD (unclosed) and select the files and then press the remove button. then just drag and drop the files you want to replace, and voila, the new cd is burned with the new data, the old data (although not erased) wont show up on the directory listing
2008-04-02T13:45:00.000Z	noob-africa	negge^	this is what Nero does... even Sonic RecordNow...
2008-04-02T13:45:00.000Z	noob-africa	negge^	i cant seem to be able to do this in Ubuntu... if i burn data i get duplicate sets of data... very confusing
2008-04-02T13:47:00.000Z	noob-africa	negge^	they have it on Linux? wow! let me find it... will be back
