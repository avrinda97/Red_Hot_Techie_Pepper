2007-06-11T12:46:00.000Z	gnomefreak	alexseif	you asked for help with windows since there were problems after installing windows. Please explain yourself more clearly and stop being rude
2007-06-11T12:50:00.000Z	gnomefreak	alexseif	ubuntu doesnt touch another HD unless you tell it to, either something you are doing wrong when you are cp,ing or its a windows issue
2007-06-11T12:50:00.000Z	gnomefreak	alexseif	your most likely cp'ing from windows to windows
2007-06-11T12:51:00.000Z	gnomefreak	alexseif	that will cause your exact issue
2007-06-11T12:53:00.000Z	alexseif	gnomefreak	what ?
2007-06-11T12:53:00.000Z	gnomefreak	alexseif	your mounting you win partition fro ubuntu right?
2007-06-11T12:53:00.000Z	gnomefreak	alexseif	and you are using cp after you mount win partition?
2007-06-11T12:54:00.000Z	gnomefreak	alexseif	^^^
2007-06-11T12:54:00.000Z	gnomefreak	alexseif	re-check your commands
2007-06-11T12:55:00.000Z	gnomefreak	alexseif	its not ubuntu as ubuntu can not run commands on another partition by itself UNLESS you have a script that does it
2007-06-11T12:56:00.000Z	gnomefreak	alexseif	doesnt matter what is installed if you dont have a script that does it than its user error not ubuntu error. Please see ##windows on how to make sure your files are in correct place and only the places it needs to be in
