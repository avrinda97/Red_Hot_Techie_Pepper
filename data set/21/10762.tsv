2005-04-24T16:55:00.000Z	Amaranth	queuetue	lunitik: Drop it, please.
2005-04-24T05:01:00.000Z	queuetue	Amaranth	As is lunitik, I'm sure - you must have someohow forgot to adress him with your little threat.
2005-04-24T05:01:00.000Z	Amaranth	queuetue	Yes I did.
2005-04-24T05:03:00.000Z	Amaranth	queuetue	Are you willing to support the help you're giving these people? If not, please don't make more work for us.
2005-04-24T05:04:00.000Z	Amaranth	queuetue	Ok then, no problem. I didn't see that part. :)
2005-04-24T05:04:00.000Z	Amaranth	queuetue	I thought lunitik was arguing because you were telling them to install from source or something.
2005-04-24T05:05:00.000Z	queuetue	Amaranth	No, he isn't.  hes arguing that it's innapropriate for me to suggest someone ask about an nvidia proprietary driver issue in #nvidia.
2005-05-02T10:40:00.000Z	Amaranth	queuetue	It's Ubuntu with sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop

2005-07-22T15:55:00.000Z	Amaranth	queuetue	It's down atm
2005-07-22T15:55:00.000Z	queuetue	Amaranth	Has it been down for weeks, or is it just intermittent and I check at bad times?
2005-07-22T15:55:00.000Z	Amaranth	queuetue	You can't use it in sources.list anymore.
2005-07-22T15:56:00.000Z	Amaranth	queuetue	Go to the website and look up a mirror.
2005-07-22T15:56:00.000Z	queuetue	Amaranth	Ah, ok.
2005-07-22T15:57:00.000Z	queuetue	Amaranth	Since the main site is down atm ... could you give me a mirror to use temporarily?
2005-07-22T16:01:00.000Z	queuetue	Amaranth	I managed to get the planetmirror mirror out of google cache.  Thanks.
2005-07-30T08:11:00.000Z	Amaranth	queuetue	...
2005-07-30T08:12:00.000Z	Amaranth	queuetue	See the topic.
2005-07-30T08:12:00.000Z	queuetue	Amaranth	Thanks - sorry  for not noticing.
2005-07-30T08:14:00.000Z	queuetue	Amaranth	Where can I follow the unbreaking developments? :)
2005-07-30T08:14:00.000Z	Amaranth	queuetue	No clue, I guess we have to wait for 1.0.7
