2010-03-19T08:10:00.000Z	akav		Is there a decent automated backup utility for Gnome? I think I will miss Time Machine.
2010-03-19T08:11:00.000Z	ardchoille	akav	I use pybackpack,it works great here
2010-03-19T08:12:00.000Z	akav	ardchoille	thanks. Sounds a bit amateur though
2010-03-19T08:13:00.000Z	ardchoille	akav	typical gnome gui
2010-03-19T08:20:00.000Z	akav	ardchoille	I just did a Google search, and found several recommendations for Back In Time -- http://backintime.le-web.org/
2010-03-19T08:20:00.000Z	ardchoille	akav	Oh, nice!
2010-03-19T08:21:00.000Z	ardchoille	akav	and there's an ubuntu repo too!
2010-03-19T08:21:00.000Z	ardchoille	akav	have you checked the repos for backin time? I'm seeing it in the karmic repos
2010-03-19T08:24:00.000Z	akav	ardchoille	nope, not at all. Why do you ask?
2010-03-19T08:24:00.000Z	ardchoille	akav	are you on karmic?
2010-03-19T08:25:00.000Z	akav	ardchoille	yes and no. I'm dual-booting to that on a Mac.
2010-03-19T08:25:00.000Z	akav	ardchoille	I just got a notebook; might put Karmic on there, or maybe try Lucid.
2010-03-19T08:25:00.000Z	ardchoille	akav	backintime is in the universe repo in karmic
2010-03-19T08:26:00.000Z	ardchoille	akav	That's much better than pybackpack
2010-03-19T08:26:00.000Z	akav	ardchoille	I know Lucid is not completely stable yet. But maybe stable enough. Have you tried it?
2010-03-19T08:27:00.000Z	ardchoille	akav	Nope, I don't run anything until it's released
2010-03-19T08:27:00.000Z	akav	ardchoille	perhaps it's best to go that route. Just didn't want to install Karmic then upgrade so soon after.
2010-03-19T08:28:00.000Z	ardchoille	akav	Good point, you might wait until Lucid is released, I think it's only a few weeks
2010-03-19T08:29:00.000Z	akav	ardchoille	don't think I want to keep the notebook sitting there for a month and a half either though (Lucid release is scheduled for 4/29).
2010-03-19T08:30:00.000Z	ardchoille	akav	you can always throw karmic on it now and upgrade later, up to you
2010-03-19T08:31:00.000Z	akav	ardchoille	thinking about it. I hope suspend/resume works ok on it. It does on my netbook, but does not on my Mac Mini.
