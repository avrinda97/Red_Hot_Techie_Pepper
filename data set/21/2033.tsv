2010-08-07T03:22:00.000Z	qUaNtiC_		hi im on 9.04 and ff3 suddenly shows only images, nothing written appears, just lines, whatz happening?
2010-08-07T03:23:00.000Z	rww	qUaNtiC_	What's the output of "apt-cache policy firefox"?
2010-08-07T03:23:00.000Z	rww	qUaNtiC_	(copy it to http://paste.ubuntu.com/, link the page it creates here)
2010-08-07T03:25:00.000Z	qUaNtiC_	rww	http://paste.ubuntu.com/474265/
2010-08-07T03:25:00.000Z	rww	qUaNtiC_	that's not the output of "apt-cache policy firefox"
2010-08-07T03:26:00.000Z	qUaNtiC_	rww	yes it is i just run it as u said
2010-08-07T03:27:00.000Z	qUaNtiC_	rww	so?
2010-08-07T03:28:00.000Z	rww	qUaNtiC_	considering that it consists entirely of "http://paste.ubuntu.com/", I sincerely doubt it.
2010-08-07T03:29:00.000Z	qUaNtiC_	rww	then it means it wouldnt even let me paste anthing
2010-08-07T03:33:00.000Z	rww	qUaNtiC_	close any running copies of firefox, do "mv ~/.mozilla ~/mozilla-profile" in the terminal to move your Firefox profile out of the way (you can restore it later with "rm ~/.mozilla; mv ~/mozilla-profile ~/.mozilla"), then reopen and see if the problem still happens
2010-08-07T03:33:00.000Z	qUaNtiC_	rww	kk right away
2010-08-07T03:34:00.000Z	qUaNtiC_	rww	wait can u re-write it once more?
2010-08-07T03:35:00.000Z	rww	qUaNtiC_	1) close firefox, 2) mv ~/.mozilla/ ~/mozilla-profile/ 3) start firefox
2010-08-07T03:35:00.000Z	rww	qUaNtiC_	to undo (2) later, 1) rm -r ~/.mozilla/ 2) mv ~/mozilla-profile/ ~/.mozilla/
2010-08-07T03:36:00.000Z	qUaNtiC_	rww	didnt solve the prob
2010-08-07T03:38:00.000Z	rww	qUaNtiC_	have you manually installed any fonts to your computer recently?
2010-08-07T03:39:00.000Z	qUaNtiC_	rww	i think so yes
2010-08-07T03:39:00.000Z	rww	qUaNtiC_	according to people with similar issues on Ubuntu Forums, that can cause the problem. Try removing them again and see if it fixes it.
2010-08-07T03:39:00.000Z	qUaNtiC_	rww	downloaded from dafont and copied into the fonts folder, they also worked
2010-08-07T03:40:00.000Z	qUaNtiC_	rww	ok but how can i find those recently installed fonts? i mean its so many of em
2010-08-07T03:43:00.000Z	qUaNtiC_	rww	Dr_Willis: so how do i unistall those fonts in order to have firefox working properly again and finally showing me all the writings?
