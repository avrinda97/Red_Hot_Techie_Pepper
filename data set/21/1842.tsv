2010-06-23T10:00:00.000Z	Doyle	jdsbluedevl	the resolve is great. Typical "I wish I'd known that" ending
2010-06-23T09:41:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	Doyle	can you describe the problem?
2010-06-23T09:43:00.000Z	Doyle	jdsbluedevl	I only have terminal access on this box until I fix gdm. To do that I neet network access. Fromt he termina an ifcongi -a shows eth0 using an inet and inet6 address.  I setup the inet, but I think the inet6 is messing with me. I also tried setting up wireless but i'm being stonewalled by the key.
2010-06-23T09:45:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	Doyle	ok, nvm, thought it was the same problem as me (I didn't know that 802.1X had finally gotten support in Ubuntu, so I was struggling to find the important wpa_supplicant file
2010-06-23T09:46:00.000Z	Doyle	jdsbluedevl	wpa supplicant is required for WPA encryption as it uses a different api
2010-06-23T09:46:00.000Z	Doyle	jdsbluedevl	the whole wireless from terminal situation is evil
2010-06-23T09:47:00.000Z	Doyle	jdsbluedevl	you can use something like # wpa_supplicant [ssid] [pass]
2010-06-23T09:48:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	Doyle	thanks, but I already got it figured out that full 802.1X support has been available.  That fixed one connection issue, but not the connection-sharing issue
2010-06-23T09:48:00.000Z	Doyle	jdsbluedevl	you want to setupa  proxy
2010-06-23T09:49:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	Doyle	no, a shared connection to a second device (my Roku box, but in your imagination it could be an Xbox, PS3, etc)
2010-06-23T09:50:00.000Z	Doyle	jdsbluedevl	heres a post from 05, but it should still work. You'll prolly have already seen it. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=91370
2010-06-23T09:50:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	Doyle	the problem is that in previous Ubuntu versions, I could make a connection profile for my second card.  In Lucid, I'm having trouble making one for anything but the card with the active Internet connection
2010-06-23T09:51:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	Doyle	that's the iptables method.  not gonna help.  I need to make that profile for the second card
2010-06-23T09:53:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	Doyle	I sorta do have a profile for that card right now, but it won't show up in nm-applet if the Internet-in connection isn't connected to that one (which would cause the profile to disappear from the other card)
2010-06-23T09:54:00.000Z	Doyle	jdsbluedevl	as a workaround  you coudl setup a dhcp server
2010-06-23T09:54:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	Doyle	ok, already downloaded dhcp3-server.  Whatever I did next didn't work.  What should I do next?
2010-06-23T09:56:00.000Z	Doyle	jdsbluedevl	now you're stuck.  :/
2010-06-23T09:56:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	Doyle	lemme guess, you don't know how to set one up, either
2010-06-23T09:57:00.000Z	Doyle	jdsbluedevl	I don't, but this guy does. http://www.jonathanmoeller.com/screed/?p=1677
2010-06-23T09:58:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	Doyle	haha, tried that.  Editing /etc/network/interfaces messes up the working Internet connection
2010-06-23T09:59:00.000Z	Doyle	jdsbluedevl	heres a guy that had some issues. If you look at his problems and where he went to try to fix it you may get a clue to your issue. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1417231
