2009-11-17T00:45:00.000Z	ganjanaut		font/unicode question: some cjk characters aren't showing up, but they seem to be visible on my windows machine.  any idea what i should do?
2009-11-17T00:47:00.000Z	Cale	ganjanaut	Which characters? Basically, if *some* font on your system has them, they should appear. Installing the MS Gothic and Mincho fonts tends to be helpful.
2009-11-17T00:48:00.000Z	ganjanaut	Cale	0x536
2009-11-17T00:48:00.000Z	ganjanaut	Cale	0x536A for one
2009-11-17T00:48:00.000Z	ganjanaut	Cale	most show up, just a few are missing
2009-11-17T00:48:00.000Z	Cale	ganjanaut	Aha, I'm actually missing that one too.
2009-11-17T00:49:00.000Z	ganjanaut	Cale	yeah i checked every font installed by default, none of them have it
2009-11-17T00:53:00.000Z	Cale	ganjanaut	The *real* helvetica? Probably.
2009-11-17T00:53:00.000Z	Cale	ganjanaut	Well, hmm.
2009-11-17T00:54:00.000Z	Cale	ganjanaut	It's like one of those things which maybe transcends copyright issues.
2009-11-17T00:55:00.000Z	Cale	ganjanaut	I'm just looking to see if I can find a Bitstream Cyberbit ttf. I bet that font has the characters you want.
2009-11-17T00:55:00.000Z	Cale	ganjanaut	I used to have it installed, but I don't know what happened to it.
2009-11-17T00:56:00.000Z	ganjanaut	Cale	ah, ty
2009-11-17T01:00:00.000Z	Cale	ganjanaut	http://ftp.nluug.nl/netscape/communicator/extras/fonts/windows/
2009-11-17T01:00:00.000Z	Cale	ganjanaut	Get Cyberbit.ZIP from there, and unpack it into your ~/.fonts
2009-11-17T01:00:00.000Z	Cale	ganjanaut	It'll fill in the missing characters :)
2009-11-17T01:00:00.000Z	ganjanaut	Cale	do i need to change system fonts?
2009-11-17T01:01:00.000Z	Cale	ganjanaut	The system will use it automatically as a fallback.
2009-11-17T01:01:00.000Z	ganjanaut	Cale	ty :)
2009-11-17T01:05:00.000Z	Cale	ganjanaut	I'm not certain that there aren't other holes which are being plugged by other fonts on my system, but on a quick scroll through the CJK part of unicode in Character Map, I don't see any missing characters now.
2009-11-17T02:47:00.000Z	ganjanaut	Cale	I tried install "unifont", that seems to have worked
