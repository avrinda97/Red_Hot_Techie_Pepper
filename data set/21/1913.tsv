2010-03-16T19:13:00.000Z	nilsma		Anyone have any pointers on how to get microphone working on 8.10?
2010-03-16T19:15:00.000Z	puser	nilsma	are you trying to use it in Skype or it doesn't work anywhere?
2010-03-16T19:20:00.000Z	puser	nilsma	because, I've had a problem with a mic in skype, while I saw that it was getting feedback from microphone monitoring soft. I had to uncheck "allow skype to automatically adjust my mixer levels", because it was always lowering the mic level too low automatically. When I unchecked it and moved the mic in mic properties up, it started working.
2010-03-16T19:22:00.000Z	nilsma	puser	ill try that and see if it changes anything
2010-03-16T19:25:00.000Z	nilsma	puser	switching off the automatically adjust my mixer levels did nothing im afraid :/
2010-03-16T19:26:00.000Z	puser	nilsma	you also have to move the mic all the way up
2010-03-16T19:27:00.000Z	puser	nilsma	pavumeter --record
2010-03-16T19:27:00.000Z	puser	nilsma	alsamixer -c 0
2010-03-16T19:28:00.000Z	puser	nilsma	are you using internal or external mic?
2010-03-16T19:28:00.000Z	nilsma	puser	i assume you mean in volume control panel? i have adjusted it there, however there is a small icon on the "50s-style microhpone" below it that has a small x over it - tho removing it and closing does nothing (wont save)
2010-03-16T19:29:00.000Z	puser	nilsma	try doing it with the command I gave you.
2010-03-16T19:31:00.000Z	puser	nilsma	if you have an internal mic, you have to press spacebar on intmic section, so that you get: L CAPTUR R switched on on both int mic places. If you have external mic, you will have to do it on ext mic instead and move the level all the way up.
2010-03-16T19:34:00.000Z	puser	nilsma	did you try the pavumeter --record
2010-03-16T19:34:00.000Z	nilsma	puser	i will have to install it first, trying the line in idea, and youre alsamixer instructions atm
2010-03-16T19:38:00.000Z	nilsma	puser	alsamixer: master capture is 100%, "Line" 100% L capt R, "Mic" L capt R, and "Mic Sele" with mic1/mic2, "Amic" 100% ... nothing seems to be off, though i am no pro at this
2010-03-16T19:39:00.000Z	puser	nilsma	did you press F4 in there?
2010-03-16T19:40:00.000Z	nilsma	puser	yes, i went thru first "capture"-tab, then the "all"-tab
2010-03-16T19:43:00.000Z	nilsma	puser	pavumeter --record, gives an error message: connection failed: connection refused
2010-03-16T19:44:00.000Z	puser	nilsma	in view you should have [Capture] selected. You should have only capture devices there, i.e. mic, line-in, no speakers. You need to select the right input. Like, for example, I have two mics in there. One Ext mic, and one int mic. Each have 2 sections. One - selection section, the other level. The level should be up and selection should say L CAPTUR R.
2010-03-16T19:45:00.000Z	puser	nilsma	maybe you don't have pulseaudio installed? Skype requires PulseAudio
2010-03-16T19:45:00.000Z	nilsma	puser	how do i check for pulseaudio?
