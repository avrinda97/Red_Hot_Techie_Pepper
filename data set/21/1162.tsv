2011-02-13T14:51:00.000Z	Chipzzz		vlc player does a nice job with flash files
2011-02-13T14:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Chipzzz	minitube is much lighter in RAM ;)
2011-02-13T14:51:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ActionParsnip	thanks for that... I'll try it
2011-02-20T04:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Chipzzz	use gksudo with nautilus, sudo is NOT for gui apps
2011-02-21T09:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Chipzzz	not: sudo apt-get update
2011-02-21T09:35:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ActionParsnip	thanks... this thing's driving me buggy (like my DX 2400 ... lol)
2011-05-03T21:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Chipzzz	why not boot to gnome classic
2011-05-03T21:14:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ActionParsnip	That's a good idea as well
2011-05-03T21:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Chipzzz	I find a lot of people saying "boohoo i'll use maverick" when gnome classic is the SAME as merick desktop...
2011-05-03T21:15:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ActionParsnip	Thanks for that... I'll consider it
2011-09-22T15:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Chipzzz	have you added a repo for a later release? or for Debian by any chance?
2011-09-22T15:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Chipzzz	you should not mix repos from other releases, or ANY at al from Debian
2011-09-22T15:54:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ActionParsnip	Thanks for the assistance but i think i'm going to write this project off as a bad idea ;)
2012-01-06T11:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Chipzzz	its just 'slash' the other way is a switch
2012-01-06T11:04:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ActionParsnip	"escape", actually, but I notice he used dev\sda3 instead of /dev/sda3, so I thought he might be a recent Windows convert
2012-01-06T11:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Chipzzz	\ is also called a 'slosh' according to wikipedia. interesting stuff
2012-01-06T11:09:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ActionParsnip	that's interesting... I was unaware... it is interesting stuff, though
2012-01-06T11:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Chipzzz	if they are linux filesystems, yes
2012-01-06T11:43:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ActionParsnip	so the workaround is easy enough... only root can change the root directories of the USB sticks, but everything else becomes accessible to users that way
2012-02-26T04:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Chipzzz	top right, not top left
2012-03-05T06:32:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ActionParsnip	(*big thumbs-up*)
