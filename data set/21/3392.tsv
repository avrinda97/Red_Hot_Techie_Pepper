2009-01-08T10:59:00.000Z	Roasted		Question for you Amarok users. What output engine are you using? Autodetect? Alsa? Pulse?
2009-01-08T11:01:00.000Z	Roasted		Nobody uses Amarok?
2009-01-08T11:02:00.000Z	Roasted		AMAROKKKKKKKKK
2009-01-08T11:03:00.000Z	Roasted		Ubuntu is not difficult. It's just different.
2009-01-08T11:03:00.000Z	rxs	Roasted	what evrsion of ubuntu are u using ?
2009-01-08T11:04:00.000Z	rxs	Roasted	does pulse-audio work for you ?
2009-01-08T11:05:00.000Z	rxs	Roasted	else use alsa .. works ...
2009-01-08T11:05:00.000Z	Roasted	rxs	- I assume pulse audio works. I mean, I never did anything to change my sound settings.
2009-01-08T11:06:00.000Z	Roasted	rxs	- the only thing I did was I have to select my PCI sound card to be used in Ubuntu, because I leave my onboard card activated since Vista lovlingly doesnt support my PCI sound card. So I essentially use onboard for Vista, PCI sound card for Ubuntu. Only trick is I need to select it when I boot up.
2009-01-08T11:06:00.000Z	rxs	Roasted	PA has been a bit odd in 8.10
2009-01-08T11:07:00.000Z	rxs	Roasted	paste output for terminal: asoundconf list
2009-01-08T11:16:00.000Z	rxs	Roasted	yes its normal to have alsa ... I use alsa and works fine and use asoundconf / asountconf-gtk to switch between my USB based card and onboard card
2009-01-08T11:16:00.000Z	Roasted	rxs	- I just dont see why I was autodetect before and it worked and now I NEED alsa to work...
2009-01-08T11:18:00.000Z	rxs	Roasted	pulse audio keeps me wondering at times
2009-01-08T11:18:00.000Z	Roasted	rxs	- I don't really understand the point of it. Everybody told me it's so you can run youtube/amarok (or whatever) at the same time.  Yet, I never had ANY problems with Alsa at all.
2009-01-08T11:20:00.000Z	rxs	Roasted	the pulse audio confusion is one reason why I have stayed away from latest greates ubuntu on my primary machine + also add the xorg issues...
2009-01-08T11:21:00.000Z	rxs	Roasted	pulse audio in theory is a very interesting method with amoving buffer window kind if you will
2009-01-08T11:21:00.000Z	Roasted	rxs	- it sounds like pulse audio is for more top end stuff, but can also be used for everyday stuff for the typical user. Regardless, it's based on alsa from what I understand, and alsa is still easily usable and whatnot.
2009-01-08T11:23:00.000Z	rxs	Roasted	to me pulse audio was a drastic inclusion in unbuntu .. they should have waited ....
2009-01-08T11:23:00.000Z	Roasted	rxs	- I heard fedora supports pulse, so I'm sure it was some sort of "keep up with everybody" movement.
2009-01-08T11:24:00.000Z	Roasted	rxs	- but like I said, I just dont get how I was autodetect and BAM, now I need alsa. Unless I WAS alsa and it somehow reset itself to autodetect, which I cant see happening. Ah well.
