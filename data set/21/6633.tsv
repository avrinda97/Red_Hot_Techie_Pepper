2007-02-26T15:57:00.000Z	Chubby_fingers	oggy	: no easy
2007-02-26T15:58:00.000Z	Chubby_fingers	oggy	: you just run the installer & that's it
2007-02-26T15:59:00.000Z	Chubby_fingers	oggy	: 1 slight issue when installing is the CD change issue ,where the installer won't return the one disc to insert the other ,but there is an easy fix for that , let me know if you run into it !
2007-02-26T16:02:00.000Z	Chubby_fingers	oggy	: if you get errors installing cos of 64bit ; try putting "linux32" in front of the install command e.g. linux32 sh "linuxUT2004INSTALL.sh"
