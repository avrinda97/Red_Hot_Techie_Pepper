2010-08-05T10:38:00.000Z	razz11		how to add a user to suoders file, I created a new user and cannot use sudo!!
2010-08-05T10:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	razz11	use user management or cli to add the user to the admin group, then log it off then on, it will have sudo
2011-01-21T13:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	razz11	sudo lshw | less
2011-01-21T13:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	razz11	there is also lshw-gtk if command line scares you
2011-01-21T13:21:00.000Z	razz11	ActionParsnip	forgot, thank you.
2011-01-21T13:40:00.000Z	razz11	ActionParsnip	whats the best way to grab files from the the remote system, I am using SSH, can I use SCP to pull files from the server end
2011-01-21T13:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	razz11	totally
2011-01-21T13:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	razz11	nautilus can also mount sshfs :-)
2011-01-21T13:41:00.000Z	razz11	ActionParsnip	greppy: what is the command syntax
2011-02-13T15:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	razz11	sudo apt-get install nvidia-current   should do it
2011-02-13T15:25:00.000Z	razz11	ActionParsnip	tried, installs but cannot activate it
2011-02-13T15:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	razz11	try running: sudo nvidia-xconfig   then reboot
2011-02-13T15:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	razz11	if you get no X server, boot to root recovery mode and rename the xorg.conf file
2011-02-13T15:30:00.000Z	razz11	ActionParsnip	tried xorg.conf default install, still no use, But cannot run nvidia-xconfig, not sure why
2011-02-13T15:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	razz11	it needs sudo, it should come down in the driver
2011-02-13T15:32:00.000Z	razz11	ActionParsnip	sorry tried sudo, let me start afresh
2011-07-23T15:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	razz11	sadly you can't, you can heck its status in the output of: top
2011-07-23T15:11:00.000Z	razz11	ActionParsnip	I am running this command from a live USB image to my internal hard drive, I don't see my hard drive light flashing
2011-07-23T15:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	razz11	hmm, i'd check top, see what's shaking
2011-07-23T15:14:00.000Z	razz11	ActionParsnip	dd is definitely stressing the CPU, so there is no way to check if it's writing data to the disk?
2011-07-23T15:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	razz11	not to my knowledge
