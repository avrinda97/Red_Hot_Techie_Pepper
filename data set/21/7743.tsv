2009-05-13T23:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	matrix_	ok you got it working, but  if you had to install graphics card driver before, well it won't be there now
2009-05-13T23:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	matrix_	system > administaration  > hardware drivers
2009-05-13T23:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	matrix_	yeah
2009-05-13T23:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	matrix_	ok
2009-05-13T23:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	matrix_	what card you got?
2009-05-13T23:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	matrix_	Intel maybe?  maybe a Intel graphics card to, meaning there woudn't be a driver in there
2009-05-13T23:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	matrix_	nividia and ATI drivers tend to be in that thing, and nothing else as far as I know.   ok  fine  try compiz again if you want
2009-07-16T00:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	matrix_	hmm
2009-07-16T00:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	matrix_	the application itself is  probably  ok,  if  it's running on Windows
2009-07-16T00:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	matrix_	Wine is pretty good, but far from perfect,  certain apps just work, others need configuring
2009-07-16T00:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	matrix_	How much RAM do you have?  ,because with enough you can run Windows inside Ubuntu in a virtual machine,   not that good for 3D gaming, but  for your app  it will be good
2009-07-16T00:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	matrix_	that will do it
2009-07-16T00:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	matrix_	well XP and  a few other versions, not sure about Vista
2009-07-16T00:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	matrix_	as much as I like virtual machines though
2009-07-16T00:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	matrix_	they should really be a last resort when it comes to Windows programs, before doing a psyical boot
2009-07-16T00:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	matrix_	if the vm won't cut it
2009-07-16T00:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	matrix_	XP,  Windows 7 RC,   etc etc,  should all run in VM on your computer, not sure about Vista
2009-07-16T00:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	matrix_	try #winehq  they may have some ideas on how to get your program to work properly in Wine
2009-07-16T00:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	matrix_	try #winehq
2009-09-03T23:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	matrix_	lspci in the terminal
