2009-03-19T08:25:00.000Z	lstarnes	scunizi	oh
2009-04-18T05:39:00.000Z	lstarnes	scunizi	it's not exactly a .exe, but more like an installer package
2009-04-18T05:39:00.000Z	scunizi	lstarnes	for those coming from win it's the easiest reference to get a hold of mentally for understanding.
2009-05-15T08:47:00.000Z	lstarnes	scunizi	make is included with build-essential iirc
2009-05-15T08:48:00.000Z	scunizi	lstarnes	ah.. thought so but wasn't quite sure.
2009-07-29T22:18:00.000Z	lstarnes	scunizi	if they're on the same LAN, yes
2009-07-29T22:18:00.000Z	scunizi	lstarnes	thanks.. can you tell me basically why you'd want a different subnet within a lan?
2009-07-29T22:20:00.000Z	lstarnes	scunizi	a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 with a network of 192.168.0.0 covers 192.168.0.0 through 192.168.0.255
2009-07-29T22:21:00.000Z	lstarnes	scunizi	a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 is equivalent to 192.168.0.* while 255.255.0.0 is 192.168.*.*
2009-07-29T22:22:00.000Z	lstarnes	scunizi	another way to notate it is using CIDR
2009-07-29T22:22:00.000Z	scunizi	lstarnes	so with the second subnet mask I could effectively do an address range of 192.168.1.1-255 ?
2009-07-29T22:23:00.000Z	lstarnes	scunizi	255.255.0.0?
2009-07-29T22:24:00.000Z	scunizi	lstarnes	yes.. I have a voip server and phone system with a subnet mask of 255.255.0.0 and was trying to figure out if I can change it to 255.255.255.0 to make it easier to access the backend admin functions via browser thereby eliminating the need to change the subnet mask in the networking to access it.
2009-07-29T22:25:00.000Z	lstarnes	scunizi	can you access it without changing the subnet mask?
2009-07-29T22:25:00.000Z	scunizi	lstarnes	no
2009-07-29T22:27:00.000Z	lstarnes	scunizi	is the voip server on the same LAN as your current system?
2009-07-29T22:27:00.000Z	scunizi	lstarnes	yes
2009-11-14T10:26:00.000Z	scunizi	lstarnes	usser_ vbox works great for one vm at a time.. vmware & xen is better for running multiple vm's at the same time.. personally I use vbox.. simple needs
2009-11-14T10:27:00.000Z	lstarnes	scunizi	I've found kvm to be effective for running multiple vms
2009-11-14T10:27:00.000Z	scunizi	lstarnes	that too
