2009-09-04T08:49:00.000Z	SpeakerBox		well it asked for my password
2009-09-04T08:49:00.000Z	SpeakerBox		what extension will a file have that doesn't need to be installed?
2009-09-04T08:49:00.000Z	SpeakerBox		.deb means you have to install it right?
2009-09-04T08:50:00.000Z	SpeakerBox		well can someone give me a link to php5 that doesn't need to be installed and can just run on my shell from download
2009-09-04T08:50:00.000Z	SpeakerBox		man but you said earlier that ubuntu can run programs without needing to be installed like putty.exe on windows
2009-09-04T08:51:00.000Z	SpeakerBox		well let me just tell you my program
2009-09-04T08:52:00.000Z	SpeakerBox		I have a website project for my school. I used php and mysql for it. now I login to the school's ubuntu command line shell and I find out that they have apache running without php5 or mysql.
2009-09-04T08:52:00.000Z	SpeakerBox		so I thought I could just download php5 and mysql myself
