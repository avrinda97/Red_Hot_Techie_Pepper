2006-07-28T09:32:00.000Z	snoops		yep about a month and a half ago s_spiff
2006-07-28T09:32:00.000Z	snoops		worked fine
2006-07-28T09:32:00.000Z	s_spiff	snoops	works?
2006-07-28T09:33:00.000Z	s_spiff	snoops	did it give any problems?
2006-07-28T09:34:00.000Z	snoops	s_spiff	be aware this is ALPHA software we're talking about
2006-07-28T09:35:00.000Z	s_spiff	snoops	alpha as in testing stages right? or is ALPHA a company?
2006-07-28T09:35:00.000Z	s_spiff	snoops	i can install it straight from the repos right ? using syaptic?
2006-07-28T09:36:00.000Z	snoops	s_spiff	you've got to follow a guide, edit a few files, setup stuff..
2006-07-28T09:36:00.000Z	s_spiff	snoops	any idea where i can find this guide?
2006-07-28T09:37:00.000Z	s_spiff	snoops	its a gigabye motherboard with nvidia chipset and amd64 processor
2006-07-28T09:38:00.000Z	s_spiff	snoops	and i'm using on board graphics.. havent put another graphic card
2006-07-28T09:38:00.000Z	snoops	s_spiff	cool well basically http://wiki.ubuntu.com/CompositeManager/Xgl then http://wiki.ubuntu.com/CompositeManager/InstallingCompiz
2006-07-28T09:40:00.000Z	s_spiff	snoops	so it may not work on mine? i have a 6200 geforce onboard. if that infor makes a diff :)
2006-10-20T08:51:00.000Z	snoops	s_spiff	well at the moment aiglx supports intel graphics chipsets. Nvidia have come out with a beta driver which supports aiglx, but I haven't personally used it
2006-10-20T08:52:00.000Z	s_spiff	snoops	well i have a nvidia chipset, so should i go for glx then?
2006-10-20T08:52:00.000Z	snoops	s_spiff	but you should be able to use beryl with either aiglx or xgl..I've got an nvidia (with the nvidia drivers from the repositories) and xgl running perfectly
2006-10-20T08:53:00.000Z	s_spiff	snoops	thanks. I'll give it a shot, and let you know how it worked.
2006-10-20T08:53:00.000Z	snoops	s_spiff	that's what I'd do for now.. Will change soonish etc.. but the development/advancement for beryl is massive
2006-10-20T08:53:00.000Z	s_spiff	snoops	so i read. for starters i think this would be a handful for a noob.
2006-10-20T08:58:00.000Z	s_spiff	snoops	I'm using this wiki http://wiki.beryl-project.org/index.php/Install/Ubuntu/Dapper/XGL
2006-10-20T08:59:00.000Z	s_spiff	snoops	and when i call for beryl installtion using apt-get install, it says beryl not found, what do i do?
