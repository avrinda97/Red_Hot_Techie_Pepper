2008-03-15T17:13:00.000Z	gyaresu_	lesshaste	LimCore You won't get good 3D rendering on open driver. The nvidia 9600gt that just came out is very good at ~$200. Is that what you were asking?
2008-03-15T17:16:00.000Z	lesshaste	gyaresu_	(s)he needs a newer driver
2008-03-15T17:17:00.000Z	gyaresu_	lesshaste	You are quick to tell people things that are not terribly helpful. It's hard (especially if your french) to appreciate humor/irony on an IRC channel. (Just thought i'd mention it. No offence meant).
2008-03-15T17:17:00.000Z	lesshaste	gyaresu_	I am not at all offended but actually what was it that was unhelpful?
2008-03-15T17:17:00.000Z	lesshaste	gyaresu_	was it "not here" ?
2008-03-15T17:18:00.000Z	lesshaste	gyaresu_	anything else?
2008-03-15T17:18:00.000Z	lesshaste	gyaresu_	"You are quick to tell people things that are not terribly helpful"... implies a bigger problem :)
2008-03-15T17:19:00.000Z	lesshaste	gyaresu_	I thought that was quite helpful :)
2008-03-15T17:19:00.000Z	lesshaste	gyaresu_	don't forget my very helpful reply to vl4dy :)
2008-03-15T17:20:00.000Z	lesshaste	gyaresu_	actually.. the least helpful thing I have seen here today was, have you tried google or the wiki :)
2008-03-15T17:21:00.000Z	gyaresu_	lesshaste	It's always a good indicator if they have provided no other info.
2008-03-15T17:23:00.000Z	gyaresu_	lesshaste	that's an invite not a rebuke :)
