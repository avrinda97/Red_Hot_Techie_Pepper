2011-09-30T07:49:00.000Z	diytto		Is there a way I can share the wireless internet on my laptop with another computer through ethernet
2011-09-30T07:50:00.000Z	paulus68	diytto	with what purpose?
2011-09-30T07:50:00.000Z	diytto	paulus68	So the other computer can access the internet
2011-09-30T07:51:00.000Z	diytto	paulus68	Think of the laptop as a bridge
2011-09-30T07:51:00.000Z	paulus68	diytto	I wouldn't operate like that since the speed of your internet is going to be adapted to the speed of your wireless connection
2011-09-30T07:52:00.000Z	diytto	paulus68	Yes, well my internet connection is too slow for it to matter
2011-09-30T07:54:00.000Z	paulus68	diytto	then why bring it even more down, since you have a wireless connection you have a wifi modem, if so you should have at least 4 ethernet ports available to plug in your 2nd computer
2011-09-30T07:54:00.000Z	diytto	paulus68	It is in another room
2011-09-30T07:55:00.000Z	paulus68	diytto	 no need to bridge, you also need to be aware that both computers need to be active in order to make that internet connection work
2011-09-30T07:56:00.000Z	paulus68	diytto	if your laptop is going into hybernation you don't have internet on your computer
2011-09-30T07:56:00.000Z	paulus68	diytto	not good for a laptop
2011-09-30T07:57:00.000Z	paulus68	diytto	what is the current layout of your network
2011-09-30T07:58:00.000Z	paulus68	diytto	then buy yourself an ethernet cable and connect this with 1 of your routers and plug it in straight away into your desktop
2011-09-30T07:59:00.000Z	diytto	paulus68	It will have to be a long ethernet cable :/
2011-09-30T08:00:00.000Z	paulus68	diytto	why? are you not able to move the wifi routers?
2011-09-30T08:01:00.000Z	diytto	paulus68	Yeah.
2011-09-30T08:01:00.000Z	paulus68	diytto	then play with that try to enlarge the range between these 2 routers in order to get a internet cable that can be plugged into your computer
2011-09-30T08:02:00.000Z	diytto	paulus68	Will do.
2011-09-30T08:03:00.000Z	paulus68	diytto	it's also better that 1 pc in the network is connected through cable to your routers/modem you'd get funny situations if you do a reset of your wifi and you loose internet because of that :p
2011-09-30T08:05:00.000Z	diytto	paulus68	There are 2 iMacs plugged in to one of the routers
2011-09-30T08:06:00.000Z	paulus68	diytto	ok
