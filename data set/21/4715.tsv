2008-02-24T13:33:00.000Z	Presario		guys, can you tell me why my installation of ubuntu using an alternate CD to my presario is pausing on random stages of the installation and never reached the end where I could use it? this happens everytime and I almost wanna give up. I had to reboot and reinstall about 10 times and still the same thing.... it wont just install fully. It's like asif my dvd drive fell asleep for a moment and sometimes it don't even wake up
2008-02-24T13:35:00.000Z	Presario		erm anyone know how to solve my solution?
2008-02-24T13:36:00.000Z	Z_o-s-1	Presario	: are you sure your cd is good?
2008-02-24T13:37:00.000Z	Presario	Z_o-s-1	yes... verified with the burner software and the "check cd for defect" that is bundeled along with the cd
2008-02-24T13:38:00.000Z	Z_o-s-1	Presario	: hmmm......i really dont know, you say that it stops randomly?
2008-02-24T13:39:00.000Z	Presario	Z_o-s-1	yes at different stages every time. and a side note... the installer recognizes the hard disk im installing is as SCSI1 but i'm sure that it should recognize as IDE or something like that
2008-02-24T13:40:00.000Z	Z_o-s-1	Presario	: Have you tried a regular live CD?
2008-02-24T13:41:00.000Z	Presario		yes and it doesnt even start the graphical stuff. it worked great on the laptop I'm using which i installed ubuntu USING THAT LIVE CD
2008-02-24T13:41:00.000Z	Presario		Z_o-s-1:that's y i turned to alternate cd
2008-02-24T13:42:00.000Z	Z_o-s-1	Presario	: I dont really know what to say here
2008-02-24T13:43:00.000Z	Presario		Z_o-s-1:hmms... thanks for looking into the matter though
2008-02-24T13:43:00.000Z	Presario	Z_o-s-1	just wanna know if it's linked..... does 40pin IDE cables makes data transfer a little difficult?
2008-02-24T13:44:00.000Z	Z_o-s-1	Presario	: It shouldnt matter, did it have windows on it before?
2008-02-24T13:45:00.000Z	Presario		yeah but this is a reformatted hard drive.
2008-02-24T13:46:00.000Z	Presario	Z_o-s-1	I'm trying to have a fresh install in my system
2008-02-24T13:47:00.000Z	Z_o-s-1		presario : I dont know what could be causing it to freeze
2008-02-24T13:50:00.000Z	Presario	Z_o-s-1	do you think it's because of my 40pin plug? it's connected to a slave and master optical storage drives...
2008-02-24T13:50:00.000Z	Presario	Z_o-s-1	but i had no problems using it in windows before
2008-02-24T13:52:00.000Z	Z_o-s-1	Presario	: Have you tried running memetst86 included on the alt.cd?
2008-02-24T13:53:00.000Z	Presario	Z_o-s-1	erm... is that a RAM test?
2008-02-24T13:57:00.000Z	Presario	Z_o-s-1	k found out that it is... but im sure i have no problems with my ram as i am now switching between 2 hard drives as im currently only on a cable that can only connect 1 hard drive.... going to buy the one with 2 connectors soon for dual boot
