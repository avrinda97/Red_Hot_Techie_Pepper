2005-12-12T16:08:00.000Z	linux_n00b_e		Guys I have a question: Anybody know about computer hardware?
2005-12-12T16:09:00.000Z	linux_n00b_e		I just opened my box to add more RAm to it and I see that I have room for an extra harddrive....
2005-12-12T16:10:00.000Z	linux_n00b_e		On the hard drive that's already inside there is a power cord and a grey strip that connects the drive to the computer.
2005-12-12T16:10:00.000Z	linux_n00b_e		I want to put in another drive that I have, but I don't see an extra gre3y strip.
2005-12-12T16:11:00.000Z	linux_n00b_e		Any ideas?
2005-12-12T16:11:00.000Z	linux_n00b_e		The black thing that connects to the hard drive?
2005-12-12T16:13:00.000Z	linux_n00b_e		Once I get the drive connected, how do I get ubuntu to recognize it with out having to re-install the OS?
2005-12-12T16:15:00.000Z	linux_n00b_e		Once I get the second drive installed, how do I go about reformatting it?
2005-12-12T16:17:00.000Z	linux_n00b_e		Anybody know how to reformat a second  harddrive thats been added to a box?
2005-12-12T16:18:00.000Z	linux_n00b_e		I formated the original hard drive during the install. Now I want to add a second hard drive to the box that I already installed Ubuntu on....
2005-12-12T16:18:00.000Z	feugan3333	linux_n00b_e	do you know the drive name?
2005-12-12T16:21:00.000Z	feugan3333	linux_n00b_e	You first know its name, fdisk -l will help you there.
2005-12-12T16:23:00.000Z	feugan3333	linux_n00b_e	No, every partition on linux has a device name such as /dev/hda1
2005-12-12T16:26:00.000Z	feugan3333	linux_n00b_e	the device name is probabily /dev/hdb1, but use "sudo fdisk -l" as I said earlier to make sure.
2005-12-12T16:27:00.000Z	feugan3333	linux_n00b_e	lists all the partitions in the partiton table and their device names
2005-12-12T16:29:00.000Z	feugan3333	linux_n00b_e	you can use fdisk without addin an entry to fstab, fdisk does not format the drive!
2005-12-12T16:31:00.000Z	feugan3333	linux_n00b_e	What format do you want to use (are you sharing the drive with a windows os?) ext3/fat32 ....
2005-12-12T16:32:00.000Z	feugan3333	linux_n00b_e	mksfs.ext3 driveName  (but you still have not given us the drive name)
2005-12-12T16:33:00.000Z	feugan3333	linux_n00b_e	going to be?
2005-12-12T16:34:00.000Z	feugan3333	linux_n00b_e	the command is then "sudo mkfs.ext3 /dev/hdb1"
2005-12-12T16:35:00.000Z	feugan3333	linux_n00b_e	mksfs.ext3 will also do.
