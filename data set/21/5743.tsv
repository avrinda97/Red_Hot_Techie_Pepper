2007-11-28T10:55:00.000Z	dfwlinuxguy		flashplugin-nonfree is the best option
2007-11-28T10:56:00.000Z	dfwlinuxguy		yes
2007-11-28T10:58:00.000Z	dfwlinuxguy		it blows up!!!!
2007-11-28T10:58:00.000Z	dfwlinuxguy		HA!!!
2007-11-28T10:58:00.000Z	dfwlinuxguy		what do you mean what happens?
2007-11-28T10:58:00.000Z	dfwlinuxguy		it will work just fine
2007-11-28T10:58:00.000Z	dfwlinuxguy		yes
2007-11-28T10:58:00.000Z	dfwlinuxguy		it's not on a separate partition
2007-11-28T10:59:00.000Z	dfwlinuxguy		if /home is on a separate partition and you re-partition to only having / ..it will wipe out all the files in /home
2007-11-28T11:00:00.000Z	dfwlinuxguy		free -m
2007-11-28T11:02:00.000Z	chuy_max	dfwlinuxguy	huh?, yes, free -m
2007-11-28T11:03:00.000Z	dfwlinuxguy	chuy_max	that will give you your RAM usage stats
2007-11-28T11:03:00.000Z	chuy_max	dfwlinuxguy	ok, so doesn't it display actual RAM usage?
2007-11-28T11:04:00.000Z	dfwlinuxguy	chuy_max	have you tried googling that error?
2007-11-28T11:06:00.000Z	chuy_max	dfwlinuxguy	it's not an error, or at least I don't think so. maybe its something I'm not understanding, gnome's system monitor tells me I'm using 360MB RAM and not using swap, while free -m tells me I'm using 896MB RAM not using swap.
2007-11-28T11:07:00.000Z	dfwlinuxguy	chuy_max	ok...where did you see something that said you were using too much swap?
2007-11-28T11:07:00.000Z	chuy_max	dfwlinuxguy	the problem is, I get two different values, from gnome system monitor and free -m
2007-11-28T11:08:00.000Z	chuy_max	dfwlinuxguy	my system is set to use 512MB swap, but it doesn't use any at the time, I have plenty of RAM: 1.28GB RAM
2007-11-28T11:09:00.000Z	chuy_max	dfwlinuxguy	and I also was concerned because having open xchat, amarok and amsn and using almost 900MB RAM, I was like, wtf, isn't that supposed to be too much RAM for just a few apps?
2007-11-28T11:10:00.000Z	chuy_max	dfwlinuxguy	when I start my system, only like 400MB are used, but after closing apps, it's like if memory isn't released
2007-11-28T11:14:00.000Z	chuy_max	dfwlinuxguy	ok, that is the reason then, do you know why it doesn't do it automatically? (gnome system monitor shows it automatically)
