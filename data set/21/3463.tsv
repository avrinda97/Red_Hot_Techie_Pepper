2008-12-22T21:47:00.000Z	garthdb		Sorry - Newbie question.  I just installed Ubuntu and I have a few other hard drives on the system, but when I try to save anything to them it says it can't read or write to them.  Any ideas on how to fix this?
2008-12-22T21:48:00.000Z	hwilde	garthdb	are they windows drives
2008-12-22T21:48:00.000Z	garthdb	hwilde	I formatted them with GParted to ext3
2008-12-22T21:48:00.000Z	hwilde	garthdb	are they mounted ?
2008-12-22T21:48:00.000Z	garthdb	hwilde	yup
2008-12-22T21:48:00.000Z	hwilde	garthdb	what are the mountpoints
2008-12-22T21:49:00.000Z	garthdb	hwilde	one is /media/iTunes
2008-12-22T21:49:00.000Z	garthdb	hwilde	I'm using it for a itunes media server
2008-12-22T21:51:00.000Z	hwilde	garthdb	type in cd /media/iTunes   then type  "touch test.txt"
2008-12-22T21:51:00.000Z	garthdb	hwilde	permission denied
2008-12-22T21:52:00.000Z	hwilde	garthdb	ok so it's mounted as root or something
2008-12-22T21:52:00.000Z	hwilde	garthdb	you need permissions on the mountpoint
2008-12-22T21:52:00.000Z	garthdb	hwilde	can I chmod it with sudo?
2008-12-22T21:52:00.000Z	garthdb	hwilde	I'm sure I'm getting all the terms wrong :)
2008-12-22T21:54:00.000Z	garthdb	hwilde	it doesn't give me an error
2008-12-22T21:56:00.000Z	garthdb	hwilde	yup looks like it did
2008-12-22T21:57:00.000Z	garthdb	hwilde	I'm assuming I should just change the permissions at the mount point, what would be the best to change them too?
2008-12-22T21:57:00.000Z	garthdb	hwilde	I should have to "admin" type users and I like them to both be able to read at write to it
2008-12-22T21:58:00.000Z	garthdb	hwilde	*two
2008-12-22T21:59:00.000Z	hwilde	garthdb	I dunno but the issue is you don't have permisisons on the mount point
2008-12-22T22:01:00.000Z	garthdb	hwilde	thanks for helping me trouble shoot it
