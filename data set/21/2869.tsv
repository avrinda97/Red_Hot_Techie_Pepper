2009-05-27T01:26:00.000Z	_16aR_		Anyone know how to remove accentuated char from a file ?
2009-05-27T01:27:00.000Z	_16aR_		Or best ... replace the accentuated version by the no-accentuated one
2009-05-27T01:27:00.000Z	Kalmi_	_16aR_	could you rephrase that question? :s
2009-05-27T01:28:00.000Z	_16aR_	Kalmi_	I got "héhéhé", I want a command line which change "héhéhé" to "hhh", or better : "hehehe"
2009-05-27T01:29:00.000Z	_16aR_	Kalmi_	for sur, it's not only the "é" char, but too much of them (spanish html file)
2009-05-27T01:31:00.000Z	Kalmi_	_16aR_	why are you fed up with them? messed up character encoding?
2009-05-27T01:32:00.000Z	_16aR_	Kalmi_	yes, and I need to parse with xpath commandline utility
2009-05-27T01:33:00.000Z	Kalmi_	_16aR_	that definitely just of a case of messed up character encoding...
2009-05-27T01:33:00.000Z	Kalmi_	_16aR_	maybe you should be trying to solve the real problem...
2009-05-27T01:34:00.000Z	Kalmi_	_16aR_	can you send me one of thos xml files?
2009-05-27T01:34:00.000Z	_16aR_	Kalmi_	I need to process bad formed HTML file, so I pass them into HTMLTidy, then, I need to extract only one part of information, so I use xpath, but every tools f*** the encoding somehow
2009-05-27T01:34:00.000Z	Kalmi_	_16aR_	oh :)
2009-05-27T01:34:00.000Z	_16aR_	Kalmi_	http://www.axesor.es/Informes-Empresas/867513/A.SERCAMP_SL.html
2009-05-27T01:35:00.000Z	Kalmi_	_16aR_	what encoding is specified in the xml file in the end? what is it actually?
2009-05-27T01:36:00.000Z	_16aR_	Kalmi_	so, in the beginning, it is already bad
2009-05-27T01:36:00.000Z	Kalmi_	_16aR_	you could fix that using iconv
2009-05-27T01:38:00.000Z	Kalmi_	_16aR_	the world actually seems a lot nicer when encodings are not fucked up :)
2009-05-27T01:40:00.000Z	_16aR_	Kalmi_	HELL YEAH !
2009-05-27T01:42:00.000Z	Kalmi_	_16aR_	why utf-8? the files are not even utf-8....
2009-05-27T01:44:00.000Z	_16aR_	Kalmi_	because my shell is in utf-8 so the command line apps work with utf-8 when launched
2009-05-27T01:44:00.000Z	Kalmi_	_16aR_	imho they should preserve the original encoding...
