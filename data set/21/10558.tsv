2005-02-07T09:33:00.000Z	lavigj	godsmoke	just getting it to launch, getting the applet in the toolbar, things like that
2005-02-07T09:33:00.000Z	godsmoke	lavigj	well ... I'm not sure where your question is -- you click on the icon, either through the applications menu or whatever -- what else do you want to know?
2005-02-07T09:34:00.000Z	lavigj	godsmoke	how do I make that application appear? is there a way to add an applet that has not been recognized by the system?
2005-02-07T09:35:00.000Z	godsmoke	lavigj	you just use a 'launcher' in the toolbar, and tell it to launch that program
2005-02-07T09:37:00.000Z	lavigj	godsmoke	that's just it, I am also having trouble even getting the program to run. I know it is there, and that it should run, but it is not. Plus, it comes with a gnome-applet. you can find the ubuntu port at http://people.ubuntu.com/~thom/network-manager, and the official site at http://people.redhat.com/dcbw/NetworkManger
2005-02-07T09:37:00.000Z	godsmoke	lavigj	I'm not sure what you mean -- when you click on it, it doesn't start?
2005-02-07T09:38:00.000Z	lavigj	godsmoke	there is nothing to click on. when I try to run it from commandline, I can't even figure out the syntax to get it working. there are no man pages, and --help isn't helping me. Do you have any more ideas where I could look for help? that's why i was wondering if ayone was actually using it here
2005-02-07T09:40:00.000Z	godsmoke	lavigj	you're not making sense -- the network config thing in gnome isn't to be run from the command line -- you run it from the settings menu, or whereever it is in gnome
2005-02-07T09:41:00.000Z	lavigj	godsmoke	it is NOT in gnome, even after restarting X. do you have any suggestions on either 1) where to get gnome to find it, 2) where to look for more help, or 3) how to use the application itself.
2005-02-07T09:41:00.000Z	lavigj	godsmoke	this is not the built in gnome network config. this is a different application called network manager.
2005-02-07T09:42:00.000Z	godsmoke	lavigj	you're confused -- the network config app is a GNOME application -- it's not a command-line application -- if you want to configure the network via command line, use ifconfig -- as far as "how to use it" -- that's a silly question, when it's there, you select the interface you want to configure, and say static, dhcp, or bootp, and then that's it
2005-02-07T09:42:00.000Z	godsmoke	lavigj	if this is some 3rd party application -- why are you asking about it in here?
2005-02-07T09:43:00.000Z	godsmoke	lavigj	this channel is for ubuntu issues
2005-02-07T09:43:00.000Z	lavigj	godsmoke	go look at those links. I am not talking about the network-config which is a gnome app.
2005-02-07T09:43:00.000Z	lavigj	godsmoke	because I am trying to get the ubuntu install to work with it
2005-02-07T09:44:00.000Z	godsmoke	lavigj	but this is a specific package -- and the package maintainer has a website about it
2005-02-07T09:45:00.000Z	lavigj	godsmoke	yeah... that's the link I quoted. it is about 20 lines long. which is why I was hoping to find another ubuntu user who was actually using it.
2005-02-07T09:45:00.000Z	godsmoke	lavigj	you still -- in 20 minutes -- have not asked a specific question
2005-02-07T09:46:00.000Z	lavigj	godsmoke	how much more specific would you like me to be?
2005-02-07T09:46:00.000Z	godsmoke	lavigj	what steps you took that didn't work
2005-02-07T09:48:00.000Z	lavigj	godsmoke	alright, I added the source repository, got the package and installed the package, restarted dbus, added it to session, restarted gnome, and I am not finding it. I think tritium might have the answer though
