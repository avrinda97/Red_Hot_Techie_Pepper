2007-03-07T07:29:00.000Z	asaup		that my disk space goes to 0 mb
2007-03-07T07:29:00.000Z	asaup		in front of my eyes
2007-03-07T07:29:00.000Z	asaup		??
2007-03-07T07:29:00.000Z	ikonia_	asaup	check /var/archives for backups
2007-03-07T07:32:00.000Z	ikonia_	asaup	are they big ?
2007-03-07T07:33:00.000Z	ikonia_	asaup	probably not it - run du -h and look for big dirs
2007-03-07T07:33:00.000Z	ikonia_	asaup	do that from the root file system
2007-03-07T07:34:00.000Z	ikonia_	asaup	du -h . from the root file system
2007-03-07T07:36:00.000Z	ikonia_	asaup	what ?
2007-03-07T07:36:00.000Z	ikonia_	asaup	do that command and look for big files, pipe it through | more if you have to
2007-03-07T08:02:00.000Z	ikonia_	asaup	du -h shows you all the files on the machine and their size - either look for massive files or lots of little ones in the same dir
2007-03-07T08:02:00.000Z	ikonia_	asaup	I can't help you search your file systems - only you can look
2007-03-07T08:02:00.000Z	ikonia_	asaup	are you using a bittorrent client ?
2007-03-07T08:07:00.000Z	ikonia_	asaup	no
2007-03-07T08:09:00.000Z	ikonia_	asaup	no
2007-03-07T08:10:00.000Z	ikonia_	asaup	forget backup tools and look for the large files !
2007-03-07T08:15:00.000Z	ikonia_	asaup	I've told you - pipe it through more ( | more ) and read the output
2007-03-07T08:15:00.000Z	ikonia_	asaup	I've told you 3 times
2007-03-07T08:15:00.000Z	ikonia_	asaup	you're on your own
