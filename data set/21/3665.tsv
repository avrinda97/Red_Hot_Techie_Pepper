2008-11-13T03:39:00.000Z	Randall1		hi, wondering how to unistall an outdated graphics driver
2008-11-13T03:39:00.000Z	ikonia	Randall1	what driver ?
2008-11-13T03:40:00.000Z	Randall1	ikonia	a Nvidia Geforce4: MX 420 the main issue is that GLX module or something like that isn't loading upon reboot after i enable it through "hardware drivers"
2008-11-13T03:40:00.000Z	ikonia	Randall1	you know certain old cards arn't supported under 8.10
2008-11-13T03:43:00.000Z	ikonia	Randall1	your using 8.10 ?
2008-11-13T03:44:00.000Z	ikonia	Randall1	did you read what I said about older cards not being supported in 8.10 ?
2008-11-13T03:45:00.000Z	Randall1	ikonia	yes 8.10 and yes i read the release notes but it looks like nvidia released a driver for it as one shows up in "hardware drivers"
2008-11-13T03:45:00.000Z	ikonia	Randall1	no that means nothing
2008-11-13T03:45:00.000Z	ikonia	Randall1	check if your card IS supported in 8.10
2008-11-13T03:46:00.000Z	Randall1	ikonia	where would i check that
2008-11-13T03:46:00.000Z	ikonia	Randall1	in the release notes you said you'd read
2008-11-13T03:47:00.000Z	Randall1	ikonia	well i think my card falls in that category but a driver is showing up in "hardware drivers" now that wasn't before...just when i restart it tells me it needs to go into low graphics mode and that like GLX module failed to load
2008-11-13T03:48:00.000Z	ikonia	Randall1	if your card is not supported, it doesn't matter that a driver is showing up in hardware manager
2008-11-13T03:49:00.000Z	Randall1	ikonia	so happen to know if Geforce4: MX 420 is supported
2008-11-13T03:49:00.000Z	ikonia	Randall1	READ the document you said you had
2008-11-26T22:01:00.000Z	ikonia	Randall1	what is the description or symptoms of the errorr
2008-11-26T22:02:00.000Z	Randall1	ikonia	it just says upon boot up after enabling hardware drivers that the Nvidia kernal failed to initialize
2008-11-26T22:02:00.000Z	ikonia	Randall1	what video card do you have ?
2008-11-26T22:03:00.000Z	Randall1	ikonia	A geforce4: MX 420
2008-11-26T22:03:00.000Z	ikonia	Randall1	some of the support for the older cards was dropped form the later nvidia drivers, have you checked if that is supported ?
2008-11-26T22:04:00.000Z	Randall1	ikonia	i don't think it is actually? so will it just not work at all. What would you recommend as a new card
