2007-05-22T08:24:00.000Z	Gnea	PriceChild	sorry, i take that quite seriously.
2007-06-23T06:54:00.000Z	Gnea	PriceChild	it'll work like utter $&*( with the open source driver
2007-06-23T06:55:00.000Z	PriceChild	Gnea	it "works" perfectly fine. Power management, resume and hibernate are broken on restricted
2007-06-25T05:12:00.000Z	Gnea	PriceChild	it's quite ontopic, actually
2007-06-25T06:13:00.000Z	Gnea	PriceChild	sorry for the problem before, won't happen again.
2007-09-05T15:00:00.000Z	PriceChild	Gnea	vesa's kind of a standard... what card doesn't work with it?
2007-09-05T15:01:00.000Z	Gnea	PriceChild	he's got a brand-spanking new HP laptop and is trying to load the VESA X driver on it - he needs to use NV in order for it to work
2007-09-05T15:01:00.000Z	PriceChild	Gnea	why?
2007-09-05T15:02:00.000Z	PriceChild	Gnea	again what card is it?
2007-09-05T15:02:00.000Z	Gnea	PriceChild	most likely because it's so new that it's incompatible with the vesa. he said X isn't working at all.
2007-09-05T15:02:00.000Z	Gnea	PriceChild	it's an nvidia.
2007-09-05T15:02:00.000Z	Gnea	PriceChild	Video adapter
2007-09-05T15:03:00.000Z	Gnea	PriceChild	i agree that vesa *should* work with it, but he might as well just use the standard nv
2007-09-05T15:04:00.000Z	Gnea	PriceChild	he said it wasn't working, i provided a solution that will work. :)
2007-09-05T15:05:00.000Z	PriceChild	Gnea	ok cool
2008-08-31T22:48:00.000Z	PriceChild	Gnea	Btb125 ndiswrapper most likely *isn't* needed...
2008-09-12T02:04:00.000Z	PriceChild	Gnea	hmm?
2008-09-12T02:05:00.000Z	Gnea	PriceChild	i've tried very hard, but Martiini refuses to stop asking the same question over and over again, even though we've informed him that the discussion is offtopic and where it should be taken.
2009-01-04T10:19:00.000Z	Gnea	PriceChild	I can't get pulseaudio to work decently at all. I have tried, and it just doesn't work right, no matter what tutorial I try to follow off of the ubuntu forums.
2009-01-04T10:57:00.000Z	Gnea	PriceChild	HRM, I can get pulseaudio to work, but sound skips.
