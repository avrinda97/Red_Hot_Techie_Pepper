2009-04-18T15:24:00.000Z	dr_willis	anderson	 edit the sudoers file with the prope rsettings.
2009-04-18T15:25:00.000Z	anderson	dr_willis	what issues?
2009-04-18T15:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	anderson	 totally breaking the sudo 'system' for one.. or putting a huge security hole on the system for aother.
2009-04-18T15:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	anderson	  when in doubt BACKUP the original sudoers file first.
2009-04-18T15:27:00.000Z	dr_willis	anderson	 i set up specific commmds that users can run without needing the sudo password. not every thing. :) much safer

2011-08-09T21:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	anderson	 and how are you going to run this browser on the vps anyway and see its output? I think theres some missing details here.
