2009-06-09T08:01:00.000Z	lancerocke	cabrey	google's picasa yes
2009-06-09T08:01:00.000Z	cabrey	lancerocke	picasa for linux
2009-06-09T08:01:00.000Z	lancerocke	cabrey	well it lacks some features like 'open file'
2009-06-09T08:02:00.000Z	cabrey	lancerocke	File > Add file to Picasa...
2009-06-09T08:02:00.000Z	lancerocke	cabrey	no 'open file'
2009-06-09T08:03:00.000Z	cabrey	lancerocke	it's the same thing
2009-06-09T08:03:00.000Z	lancerocke	cabrey	like when ur previewing the image and u wanna open the file with ur default image viewer
2009-06-09T08:03:00.000Z	cabrey	lancerocke	you mean double click on image and it will open it with picasa?
2009-06-09T08:03:00.000Z	lancerocke	cabrey	no i mean 'right click>open file
2009-06-09T08:04:00.000Z	lancerocke	cabrey	after u have already double clicked th ethumbnail
2009-06-09T08:04:00.000Z	cabrey	lancerocke	I right clicked on one of the images and selected open file, then it opened it in eye of gnome
2009-06-09T08:04:00.000Z	lancerocke	cabrey	not for me. ill show u a screenshot
2009-06-09T08:05:00.000Z	cabrey	lancerocke	do you have picasa 3 or 2?
2009-06-09T08:05:00.000Z	lancerocke	cabrey	http://www.imagebam.com/image/045f1338411097
2009-06-09T08:05:00.000Z	lancerocke	cabrey	picasa 3
2009-06-09T08:07:00.000Z	cabrey	lancerocke	hmm that function works perfectly for me. did you do what the error dialog suggested?
2009-06-09T08:08:00.000Z	lancerocke	cabrey	not yet. just thought id go for a liux picasa equivalent instead
2009-06-09T08:08:00.000Z	lancerocke	cabrey	gnome though
2009-06-09T08:08:00.000Z	cabrey	lancerocke	you can try f-spot but imho it is not as good as picasa
