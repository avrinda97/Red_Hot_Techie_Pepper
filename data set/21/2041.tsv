2010-02-08T02:21:00.000Z	z3r0-0n3		There is nothing wrong with that, but this is larger than 1024,
2010-02-08T02:21:00.000Z	z3r0-0n3		and could in certain setups cause problems with:
2010-02-08T02:21:00.000Z	z3r0-0n3		1) software that runs at boot time (e.g., old versions of LILO)
2010-02-08T02:21:00.000Z	z3r0-0n3		2) booting and partitioning software from other OSs
2010-02-08T02:21:00.000Z	z3r0-0n3		   (e.g., DOS FDISK, OS/2 FDISK)
2010-02-08T02:22:00.000Z	hyperstream	z3r0-0n3	leet name, stupid person... read the topic l33t0
2010-02-08T02:49:00.000Z	hyperstream	z3r0-0n3	places -> Computer -> "hard drive"
2010-02-08T02:50:00.000Z	hyperstream	z3r0-0n3	actually, thats how you view your hard drive. perhaps if you had tried it first, you wouldnt have made yourself look silly just then.
2010-02-08T02:51:00.000Z	hyperstream	z3r0-0n3	refer to my post about viewing your hard drive.
2010-02-08T02:52:00.000Z	hyperstream	z3r0-0n3	please do not repeat. read the post above from ubottu
2010-02-08T02:53:00.000Z	z3r0-0n3	hyperstream	buh bye :)
2010-02-08T02:53:00.000Z	hyperstream	z3r0-0n3	take it easy.
2010-02-08T02:55:00.000Z	hyperstream	z3r0-0n3	you can go to 'Places->Computer->"CLICK harddrive/partition"'
2010-02-08T02:56:00.000Z	hyperstream	z3r0-0n3	provided its mounted.
2010-02-08T02:57:00.000Z	hyperstream	z3r0-0n3	some more info, could help solve your issue, such as - i cant see my partition in that window. or an error you could pastebin.
2010-02-08T03:00:00.000Z	hyperstream	z3r0-0n3	its already mounted.
2010-02-08T03:14:00.000Z	z3r0-0n3	hyperstream	stop wasting your time. maybe you dont normally have better things to do, in that case I recommend creating better things to do.
2010-02-08T03:14:00.000Z	z3r0-0n3	hyperstream	you're not helping me and the only messages i see from you are the ubottu ones
2010-02-08T03:15:00.000Z	hyperstream	z3r0-0n3	thats because you have me on ignore, while requestion help. since you cannot see my messages, i have to give you info based via the bot. go READ (Someone relay this to him please)
2010-02-11T07:55:00.000Z	hyperstream	z3r0-0n3	figure of speech i think, not directly related to him, altho it is in some eye's. anyhow, this is OT
