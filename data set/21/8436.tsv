2006-04-10T08:33:00.000Z	dbarnett		can anyone please help me resolve an apt dependency issue? I can't install my new graphics driver until I install my old, but I can't uninstall my old because one of it's deps is missing and I can't find a package for it anywhere
2006-04-10T08:34:00.000Z	orbin	dbarnett	pastebin the errors you're getting
2006-04-10T08:38:00.000Z	dbarnett	orbin	tritium: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/11494
2006-04-10T08:42:00.000Z	orbin	dbarnett	have you tried removing the fglrx drivers beforehand?
2006-04-10T08:42:00.000Z	dbarnett	orbin	yes, I can't remove them
2006-04-10T08:42:00.000Z	dbarnett	orbin	same error
2006-04-10T08:43:00.000Z	orbin	dbarnett	how did you install the driver?
2006-04-10T08:44:00.000Z	dbarnett	orbin	apparently very sloppily
2006-04-10T08:44:00.000Z	dbarnett	orbin	I really don't remember. I had a lot of problems and installed and uninstalled several times, clearly I munged something up
2006-04-10T08:44:00.000Z	orbin	dbarnett	did you use the wiki page at all?
2006-04-10T08:45:00.000Z	dbarnett	orbin	there are a few different pages with different directions I tried them all
2006-04-10T08:45:00.000Z	orbin	dbarnett	recognise this one at all: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI ?
2006-04-10T08:46:00.000Z	dbarnett	orbin	yes
2006-04-10T08:47:00.000Z	dbarnett	orbin	I found this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=146014&highlight=xorg-driver-fglrx+uninstall I'm hesitant to try step for in dinxter's post but I might have to
2006-04-10T08:48:00.000Z	orbin	dbarnett	have you tried the reintall method?
2006-04-10T08:48:00.000Z	dbarnett	orbin	on the fglrx driver? yes
2006-04-10T08:49:00.000Z	dbarnett	orbin	can't reinstall because it's missing the mesa driver which I can't find anywhere
2006-04-10T08:50:00.000Z	orbin	dbarnett	i'm not too sure, sorry.
2006-04-10T08:50:00.000Z	dbarnett	orbin	ok, thanks
2006-04-10T08:50:00.000Z	orbin	dbarnett	good luck
2006-04-10T08:51:00.000Z	dbarnett	orbin	I think I'll try editing the postrm and hope for the best! Thanks for your time
