2008-08-22T14:08:00.000Z	Totakeke		Hmm, if I install Linux onto my flash drive, and it uses the flash drive for /tmp, the persistent linux installation guide thing says that putting /tmp on the flash drive might cause excessive wear and tear. Should I do it anyway? I mean, it'll last a good while, won't it? I won't be using it all the time. (This is more of a hypothetical question :P)
2008-08-22T14:09:00.000Z	KenBW2	Totakeke	i installed Ubuntu onto a USB drive. it killed in a few hours
2008-08-22T14:02:00.000Z	KenBW2	Totakeke	i have
2008-08-22T14:08:00.000Z	KenBW2	Totakeke	how you getting on with the USB install thing
2008-08-22T14:09:00.000Z	Totakeke	KenBW2	O_o
2008-08-22T14:09:00.000Z	KenBW2	Totakeke	flash memory has limited read/write capacity. instaling an OS does a lot of read/writing
2008-08-22T14:10:00.000Z	Totakeke	KenBW2	Well yeah, I knew that, but I figured it wouldn't be writing that much. But I forgot about /tmp :(
2008-08-22T14:10:00.000Z	KenBW2	Totakeke	it wasnt just /tmp - files all over the place were getting corrupted
2008-08-22T14:10:00.000Z	Totakeke	KenBW2	The guide recommends putting /tmp into ram on the computer from which you're running the flash drive (just to point out :P) But I was kind of hoping to take Linux with me places :P
2008-08-22T14:11:00.000Z	KenBW2	Totakeke	i know, i was excited at the prospect as well. but alas no can do
2008-08-22T14:13:00.000Z	KenBW2	Totakeke	youve exhausted all options for running them in Wine etc?
2008-08-22T14:13:00.000Z	Totakeke	KenBW2	Pretty much yeah
2008-08-22T14:13:00.000Z	Totakeke	KenBW2	I haven't checked on some though.
2008-08-22T14:13:00.000Z	KenBW2	Totakeke	ah well. luckily im not much of a gamer so i wiped XP
2008-08-22T14:13:00.000Z	Totakeke	KenBW2	All I really need is EVE though, and that has a Linux version.
2008-08-22T14:14:00.000Z	Totakeke	KenBW2	Lol what I would give to be able to wipe Vista -.-
2008-08-22T14:14:00.000Z	KenBW2	Totakeke	eugh. ive been forced to use Vista on someone else's PC for a month. *horrible*
2008-08-22T14:14:00.000Z	Totakeke	KenBW2	The eye candy is, well, sweet :P but as far as blue screens and hangs, I hate it. And this computer's brand new, built it myself.
2008-08-22T14:15:00.000Z	KenBW2	Totakeke	Vista always decides it knows best - that annoys me. i like that Ubuntu gives you the freedom to do what you want (even the freedom to totally f**k it up :P)
2008-08-22T14:16:00.000Z	Totakeke	KenBW2	As the saying goes, "Absolute power corrupts absolutely." Microsoft needs to work on some things. ï»¿Okay, I should get off of my Live USB flash drive before I kill it :P Thanks for all the help. (And maybe there was a gooooood reason why I wasn't able to install Linux onto my flash drive. The universe didn't want me to murder it. :P
2008-08-22T14:17:00.000Z	KenBW2	Totakeke	lol, np
