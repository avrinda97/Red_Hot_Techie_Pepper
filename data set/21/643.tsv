2011-10-01T02:06:00.000Z	RobbieCrash		Is anyone here running ZFS? If so, what speeds are you seeing for read/write and what type of drives are you running it under?
2011-10-01T02:06:00.000Z	RobbieCrash		!zfs
2011-10-01T02:06:00.000Z	SIFTU	RobbieCrash	I wouldnt run it under ubuntu
2011-10-01T02:07:00.000Z	SIFTU	RobbieCrash	thats under fuse right
2011-10-01T02:07:00.000Z	RobbieCrash	SIFTU	no there's a native Linux module
2011-10-01T02:07:00.000Z	SIFTU	RobbieCrash	ah ok, the one you have to compile yourself
2011-10-01T02:09:00.000Z	RobbieCrash	SIFTU	yeah, I've already compiled and have it running native, but the performance I'm seeing is wretched. 22MB/sec writes. 40MB/sec reads.
2011-10-01T02:09:00.000Z	SIFTU	RobbieCrash	with what RAID set and how many disks
2011-10-01T02:10:00.000Z	SIFTU	RobbieCrash	TBH I wouldnt run it under linux.. the BSD version isnt that great either.. stick to OI or solaris
2011-10-01T02:11:00.000Z	SIFTU	RobbieCrash	64bit and penty of RAM?
2011-10-01T02:11:00.000Z	RobbieCrash	SIFTU	yeah, I'm looking at maybe installing Open Solaris but I'm not that comfortable moving my file server to an OS I know nothing about.
2011-10-01T02:12:00.000Z	SIFTU	RobbieCrash	RAIDZ2 with 5 drives
2011-10-01T02:12:00.000Z	RobbieCrash	SIFTU	64bit with 8GB of RAM, arc limit at 7
2011-10-01T02:12:00.000Z	RobbieCrash	SIFTU	5 for now, and 2 more to be put in by the 15th
2011-10-01T02:12:00.000Z	SIFTU	RobbieCrash	seems all ok.. RAIDZ2 will slow you down, but still
2011-10-01T02:13:00.000Z	SIFTU	RobbieCrash	and you know you cant expand the RAIDZ2 set right
2011-10-01T02:13:00.000Z	RobbieCrash	SIFTU	yeah, I'm not expecting 800MB/sec, but I was assuming at LEAST 50MB/sec write and 100MB/sec read.
2011-10-01T02:14:00.000Z	RobbieCrash	SIFTU	wait, what? You can't expand the RAIDZ2 set? So I can't actually add more disks to the array?
2011-10-01T02:14:00.000Z	SIFTU	RobbieCrash	no you cant.. you have to create a new array
2011-10-01T02:14:00.000Z	RobbieCrash	SIFTU	should I just break it and create a RAIDZ array?
2011-10-01T02:15:00.000Z	SIFTU	RobbieCrash	you really need to plan ZFS installs. have you read the best practices guide?
