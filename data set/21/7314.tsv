2006-11-26T10:07:00.000Z	guest_		I think it's Xorg.conf
2006-11-26T10:07:00.000Z	guest_		do a locate xorg.conf
2006-11-26T10:08:00.000Z	guest_		Then you can vi into that file and change the resolution manuall I believe

2006-11-26T10:09:00.000Z	guest_		I remember using a command line interface utility to format, but I guess I can use gparted
2006-11-26T10:10:00.000Z	guest_		it would be nice to know how to format through the CLI
2006-11-26T10:10:00.000Z	guest_		Oh, if anyoe wants to read a great 80 page essay on the command line interface, I found a Neal Stephenson essay on it. check it out
