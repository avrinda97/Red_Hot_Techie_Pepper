2011-05-30T13:12:00.000Z	PCdoc	c1728p9	yep and u need to recover windows for that ...
2011-05-30T13:14:00.000Z	c1728p9	PCdoc	do you need the windows install disk to return the master boot record to what it was before the install?
2011-05-30T13:14:00.000Z	PCdoc	c1728p9	u want to dual boot ?

2011-05-30T13:16:00.000Z	c1728p9	PCdoc	yeah, I havent worked up enough guts to install it though lol
2011-05-30T13:18:00.000Z	c1728p9	PCdoc	also how hard it is to set ubuntu as my default though the new linux mbr?
2011-05-30T13:19:00.000Z	PCdoc	c1728p9	u need to install startup-manager from the synaptic manager
2011-05-30T13:19:00.000Z	c1728p9	PCdoc	can i install that after i install ubuntu?
2011-05-30T13:19:00.000Z	c1728p9	PCdoc	ok cool
2011-05-30T13:19:00.000Z	PCdoc	c1728p9	that is to be installed only after installing u ubuntu
2011-05-30T13:21:00.000Z	c1728p9	PCdoc	can you turn the timout off for choosing an operating system?
2011-05-30T13:21:00.000Z	c1728p9	PCdoc	well not turn it off, just have it automatically go to one operating system
2011-05-30T13:22:00.000Z	PCdoc	c1728p9	if u select none when it asks u .. it will automatically load the default one
2011-05-30T13:23:00.000Z	c1728p9	PCdoc	can i just set one as the primary so there is no countdown?
2011-05-30T13:23:00.000Z	PCdoc	c1728p9	its difficult to tell step by step so here is the link u shld read them and follow the steps .. the steps for recovering ubuntu after windows or recovering  windows after ubuntu are almost same https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
2011-05-30T13:24:00.000Z	c1728p9	PCdoc	ok thanks
2011-05-30T13:24:00.000Z	PCdoc	c1728p9	if u set that then there's no need for dual bot .. just have ubuntu or windows and delete the other os
