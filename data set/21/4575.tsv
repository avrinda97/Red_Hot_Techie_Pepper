2010-05-29T14:44:00.000Z	bonhoffer		i am on a remote host via ssh and want to copy a file to my local computer -- can i do this via scp
2010-05-29T14:45:00.000Z	bonhoffer		it is kinda wierd to log-in to my local machine (verizon dsl with pppoe)
2010-05-29T14:47:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	bonhoffer	on the local machine try: scp root@sweat:/path/to/file .
2010-05-29T14:47:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp		Note the "." means "put this file in the current directory".
2010-05-29T14:48:00.000Z	bonhoffer	Lunar_Lamp	got that -- always can scp from my local machine to server
2010-05-29T14:48:00.000Z	bonhoffer		want to send from the server to my local machine
2010-05-29T14:48:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	bonhoffer	then you just do it the other way around; but you'll need to know the IP or FQDN of your local machine.
2010-05-29T14:48:00.000Z	bonhoffer	Lunar_Lamp	have no idea what my localhost ip is and could find it out but it changes
2010-05-29T14:48:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp		(and have an sshd running)
2010-05-29T14:49:00.000Z	bonhoffer	Lunar_Lamp	phlak_user so that is my real question: if there is an easy way that ssh knows the ip of the incoming connection
2010-05-29T14:49:00.000Z	bonhoffer		or if i need to go back, find my (changing) ip, etc
2010-05-29T14:49:00.000Z	bonhoffer		probably will just continue to scp only from localhost
2010-05-29T14:49:00.000Z	bonhoffer		(otherwise)
2010-05-29T14:50:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	bonhoffer	is your situation just "I want to move a file from a remote server to my local one" or is it more complex? Currently it seems that you are artificially making your query more difficult than it needs to be :-)
2010-05-29T14:50:00.000Z	bonhoffer		i always do that -- i have foo.txt on my remote server ('sweat')
2010-05-29T14:50:00.000Z	bonhoffer		i want it on localhost
2010-05-29T14:50:00.000Z	bonhoffer		think i have to go to localhost and pull the file
2010-05-29T14:51:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	bonhoffer	that would be the simplest way.
2010-05-29T14:51:00.000Z	bonhoffer		or, otherwise, figure out my ip, etc
2010-05-29T14:51:00.000Z	bonhoffer	Lunar_Lamp	always done it that way, but thought my local ip might be cached somewhere via ssh on the remote server
2010-05-29T14:52:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	bonhoffer	well, if you type the command 'w' it will show you the reverse DNS entry (possibly IP) of all remotely connected users.
