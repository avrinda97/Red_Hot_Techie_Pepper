2008-07-31T02:01:00.000Z	Flannel	Dbuggger	No
2008-07-31T02:01:00.000Z	Flannel	Dbuggger	Hold alt-sysreq and slowly type each letter: r e i s u b
2008-07-31T02:02:00.000Z	Flannel	Dbuggger	yes.  the alt key, and the sysreq key
2008-07-31T02:03:00.000Z	Flannel	Dbuggger	its next to scroll lock
2008-07-31T02:03:00.000Z	Flannel	Dbuggger	usually shares a key with print screen
2008-07-31T02:04:00.000Z	Flannel	Dbuggger	what laptop?
2008-07-31T02:04:00.000Z	Dbuggger	Flannel	Found! it was in spanish :P
2008-07-31T02:04:00.000Z	Flannel	Dbuggger	Oh.  Um, you'll want to push the american/qwerty versions of r e i s u b.  I'm not sure what differences there are on a spanish layout
2008-07-31T02:05:00.000Z	Dbuggger	Flannel	what's supposer to do "r e i s u b"?
2008-07-31T02:05:00.000Z	Flannel	Dbuggger	hold alt and sysreq, then type r, then e, then i, s, u, b.  It'll safely reboot your system
2008-07-31T02:06:00.000Z	Dbuggger	Flannel	that's good to know.. but what I actually wanted is to solve the ATI problem :)
