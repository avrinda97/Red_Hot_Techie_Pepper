2005-01-18T08:39:00.000Z	trey3	Konlied	joy... dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2005-01-18T08:40:00.000Z	trey3	Konlied	dpkg-reconfigure debconf and set to 'low' priority first though... else that is useless  :/
2005-01-18T08:40:00.000Z	Konlied	trey3	you must be kidding. graah!
2005-01-18T08:41:00.000Z	trey3	Konlied	?
2005-01-18T08:42:00.000Z	trey3	Konlied	ahh... I should pay better attention  *nods* sorry
2005-01-18T08:46:00.000Z	trey3	Konlied	what vnc server are you using?
2005-01-18T08:48:00.000Z	trey3	Konlied	there are many  :/
2005-01-18T08:50:00.000Z	Konlied	trey3	sorry for delay. I had the version supplied as part of warty, and then Real VNC 4.0
2005-01-18T08:51:00.000Z	trey3	Konlied	Any reason you're not using Vino?  seems very easy to use... or are you?
2005-01-18T08:51:00.000Z	trey3	Konlied	yes
2005-01-18T08:53:00.000Z	trey3	Konlied	so does Vino afaik... and its just one click away from functional use afaict
2005-01-18T08:55:00.000Z	Konlied	trey3	Apparently vino is already installed but "command not found"
2005-01-18T08:55:00.000Z	trey3	Konlied	Computer > Preferences > Remote Desktop
2005-01-18T08:59:00.000Z	trey3	Konlied	binary is vino-server btw  :)
2005-01-18T09:01:00.000Z	Konlied	trey3	vino is exactly what I don't want. Like I said I used vncserver so I could run more than 1 desktop at different dimensions
2005-01-18T09:01:00.000Z	trey3	Konlied	eh... k
2005-01-18T09:02:00.000Z	trey3	Konlied	ahh... thats not very useful  :/
2005-01-18T09:04:00.000Z	trey3	Konlied	sorry man... thought vino would be easier... I use xhost usually, but I take it there is a reason for not using that also?
2005-01-18T09:05:00.000Z	trey3	Konlied	it lets you, but then its not Ubuntu  :/
2005-01-18T09:05:00.000Z	trey3	Konlied	just gets rid of ubuntu-* meta packages... nothing stopping you though  :/
2005-01-18T09:06:00.000Z	trey3	Konlied	not sure exactly how I helped... but yw  :)
