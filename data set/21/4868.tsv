2008-12-05T23:02:00.000Z	ppires		hi there. i've installed openoffice.org 3 using this PPA: https://launchpad.net/~openoffice-pkgs/+archive
2008-12-05T23:02:00.000Z	ppires		somewhere in my updates this got removed
2008-12-05T23:03:00.000Z	ppires		now i checked that i have the correct entries in my sources.list but I'm unable to install openoffice
2008-12-05T23:03:00.000Z	ppires		i can't even go to the preivous oofice
2008-12-05T23:03:00.000Z	rww	ppires	see the link you just posted ;)
2008-12-05T23:09:00.000Z	rww	ppires	try installing it again, then copypaste the entire output you get to pastebin
2008-12-05T23:10:00.000Z	ppires	rww	ok. gimme a sec
2008-12-05T23:10:00.000Z	rww	ppires	also, make sure the ppa stuff is gone from sources.list and you did apt-get update before that.
2008-12-05T23:11:00.000Z	ppires	rww	http://pastebin.com/m6c50ff2f and yeah i removed those entries from the file and updated everything
2008-12-05T23:12:00.000Z	rww	ppires	hmm. Is the output of sudo aptitude install openoffice.org more verbose?
2008-12-05T23:13:00.000Z	ppires	rww	nop mate, just what i shown you.
2008-12-05T23:14:00.000Z	rww	ppires	okay. Open Synaptic (System > Administration > Synaptic), click the "Status" button in the bottom-left, then click the "Installed (local or obsolete)" section. Anything related to openoffice.org in there?
2008-12-05T23:15:00.000Z	ppires	rww	checking
2008-12-05T23:16:00.000Z	ppires	rww	yeah, openoffice 3.0
2008-12-05T23:17:00.000Z	rww	ppires	remove anything in there related to OO.org, then try installing again (you'll get 2.4). When the PPA comes back up, you could consider adding the PPA again and upgrading if you need 3.0.
2008-12-05T23:17:00.000Z	ppires	rww	the thing is that i've been using oo3.0 in windows and mac. all my current docs are under that format. i'm afraid i can lose my stuff :( anyway tks a lot for the help mate
2008-12-05T23:18:00.000Z	rww	ppires	I would've thought that oo3.0 was backwards compatible with 2.4. That isn't the case?
2008-12-05T23:19:00.000Z	ppires	rww	afaik no. and there is no msoffice2007 oxml support
2008-12-05T23:19:00.000Z	ppires	rww	anyway, thanks dude
2008-12-05T23:19:00.000Z	rww	ppires	you're welcome. Hopefully 3.0 will be back in the PPA soon...
2008-12-05T23:19:00.000Z	ppires	rww	let's hope so. i guess i'll wait and edit everything in my mac from the time being. once again thank you very much
