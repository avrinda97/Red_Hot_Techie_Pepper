2009-12-31T08:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	brando753	Like the warning says, back up all data and replace the drive
2009-12-31T09:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	brando753	Physical damage
2010-01-11T08:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	brando753	Files that you don't have read permissions to will not be included in the disk usage in tools looking at individual files
2010-01-11T08:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	brando753	I'm betting there are files in ftp and ftpusers
2010-01-11T08:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	brando753	Please pastebin the output of "du -h /home" and "sudo du -h /home"
2010-01-11T08:41:00.000Z	brando753	Jordan_U	terminal is still working ...
2010-01-11T08:46:00.000Z	brando753	Jordan_U	http://pastebin.com/meede822  http://pastebin.com/m2020721b
2010-01-11T08:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	brando753	I assume that http://pastebin.com/meede822 was the one where du was run as root?
2010-01-11T08:48:00.000Z	brando753	Jordan_U	first one was root
2010-01-11T08:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	brando753	That confirms it, Disk Usage Analizer looks at all of the sizes of all of the files in a given directory to get the size of that directory, if it can't read the file ( i.e. it doesn't have permission to ) then it can't find that file's size
2010-01-11T08:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	brando753	So you have exactly 49 GIG of files that can't be read by the user you are logged in as
2010-01-11T08:50:00.000Z	brando753	Jordan_U	im the only user ...
2010-01-11T08:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	brando753	The terminal doesn't lie :)
2010-01-11T08:51:00.000Z	brando753	Jordan_U	so what do i do
2010-01-11T08:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	brando753	Check /home/ftp and /home/ftpusers
2010-01-11T08:51:00.000Z	brando753	Jordan_U	?
2010-01-11T08:51:00.000Z	brando753	Jordan_U	those are my ftp server ...
2010-01-11T08:54:00.000Z	brando753	Jordan_U	What do i do to access my 49 GB of unused space
2010-01-11T09:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	brando753	You don't have 49 GIG of free space, you have 49 GIG of files that can't be read by the user you are logged in as
2010-02-08T08:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	brando753	Try a program called "cheeze"
