2008-03-09T13:45:00.000Z	pajamian	tpyoknig	if ls doesn't show the file then it's not there.  Can you give details of exactly what you did?
2008-03-09T13:48:00.000Z	tpyoknig	pajamian	I use BT to download a file with transmission, well it downloaded it to /home/tpyoknig/download, well I needed it to be on the windows partition, do i mounted the partition with sudo mount /dev/hda5 /mnt/hda5, then i went to load the file in XP and it wasnt there so, i reboot BACK into Ubuntu and load up the termainl and do ls -la /mnt/hda5 the directory isnt there, so then i open nautilus and do a right click propet
2008-03-09T13:49:00.000Z	tpyoknig	pajamian	continued: properties and it says the 2.5GB of space used, BUT 3 file on partition totaling 13.8KB, i can send ua screenshot
2008-03-09T13:50:00.000Z	pajamian	tpyoknig	did you mount /mnt/hda5 when you went back into ubuntu to check?
2008-03-09T13:51:00.000Z	tpyoknig	pajamian	yes i did
2008-03-09T13:51:00.000Z	pajamian	tpyoknig	umount it and check, then.
2008-03-09T13:54:00.000Z	tpyoknig	pajamian	nothinng
2008-03-09T13:54:00.000Z	pajamian	tpyoknig	what was the exact command you used to move the file?
2008-03-09T13:56:00.000Z	pajamian	tpyoknig	are you sure that /mnt/hda5 existed as a directory when you issued that command and that a filesystem was mounted to it?
2008-03-09T13:56:00.000Z	tpyoknig	pajamian	 im 100% sure b/c i moved the .torrent file to it b4 i moved the directory
2008-03-09T13:58:00.000Z	pajamian	tpyoknig	I don't know.  I suspect that the mv operation didn't do what you think it did and the files ended up somewhere else.
2008-03-09T13:59:00.000Z	tpyoknig	pajamian	 in that case where? i've done a updatedb
2008-03-09T13:59:00.000Z	pajamian	tpyoknig	leopard was a directory, right?
2008-03-09T13:59:00.000Z	tpyoknig	pajamian	 correct
2008-03-09T13:59:00.000Z	pajamian	tpyoknig	try locate on one of the files inside the directory.
2008-03-09T14:00:00.000Z	pajamian	tpyoknig	I suspect that the directory may have been renamed during the mv.

2008-03-09T14:03:00.000Z	pajamian	tpyoknig	not sure.  try to remember at least part of the name of one of the files in the directory.
2008-03-09T14:09:00.000Z	tpyoknig	pajamian	did u look at my screeenshot
2008-03-09T14:09:00.000Z	pajamian	tpyoknig	yes, it doesn't tell tell me much.
2008-03-09T14:10:00.000Z	pajamian	tpyoknig	sorry, I'm out of ideas, my best advice is to try to remember at least part of one of the filenames inside the directory and do a locate on that.
