2007-12-07T15:42:00.000Z	hangthedj	chief	have you tried connecting to them, even though you can't see them?
2007-12-07T15:44:00.000Z	chief	hangthedj	depends on how you mean connected
2007-12-07T15:44:00.000Z	chief	hangthedj	I've tried the connect to server tools in gnome
2007-12-07T15:46:00.000Z	chief	hangthedj	it says with nautilus that it can't display the contents of smb://agnus/
2007-12-07T15:47:00.000Z	hangthedj	chief	did you set it up through gui, or cli?
2007-12-07T15:48:00.000Z	chief	hangthedj	there was a little youtube video I followed for setting it up.

2007-12-07T15:54:00.000Z	hangthedj	chief	i'm not sure what the default is, but you may want to uncomment the security = user
2007-12-07T15:54:00.000Z	chief	hangthedj	ok
2007-12-07T15:59:00.000Z	chief	hangthedj	didn't help much :(
2007-12-07T16:02:00.000Z	chief	hangthedj	 maybe, but as with most tools you need to know to use them :)
2007-12-07T16:02:00.000Z	hangthedj	chief	in the terminal you could try findsmb, or smbtree and see what comes up?
2007-12-07T16:03:00.000Z	chief	hangthedj	just 1 machine itself
2007-12-07T16:04:00.000Z	hangthedj	chief	did you try in #samba?
