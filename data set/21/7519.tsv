2006-09-13T06:57:00.000Z	Flux_		ok so I installed a program but it doesnt show up in application list where can I find it?
2006-09-13T06:57:00.000Z	jrib	Flux_	what program?
2006-09-13T06:58:00.000Z	jrib	Flux_	you installed rar from the repositories?
2006-09-13T07:00:00.000Z	jrib	Flux_	yeah, it's command line.  Try 'man rar'.  But the archive manager should now let you work with rar files
2006-09-13T07:03:00.000Z	Flux_	jrib	I get No manual entry for rar
2006-09-13T07:04:00.000Z	jrib	Flux_	hmm me too, guess /usr/share/doc/rar is what you will need to look into.  But isn't the archive manager letting you create and read rar files now?
2006-09-13T07:05:00.000Z	Flux_	jrib	well its opening up in ark
2006-09-13T07:06:00.000Z	jrib	Flux_	oh, archive manager is the gnome tool
2006-09-13T07:06:00.000Z	Flux_	jrib	I remeber a page in the ubuntu manual for explanation oof all the folders like etc bin media and all others what do I search for to find that?
2006-09-13T07:10:00.000Z	jrib	Flux_	not sure about the ubuntu manual but file:///usr/share/doc/debian-policy/fhs/fhs-2.3.html should give you lots of detail
2006-09-13T07:11:00.000Z	Flux_	jrib	If I want to run an application without going to application- internet-appname where can I find the "actual application"
2006-09-13T07:11:00.000Z	jrib	Flux_	well you can use the menu editor to see the path to the binary that the launcher is running
2006-09-13T07:13:00.000Z	Flux_	jrib	are most applications installed in "/usr/bin" I am talking about the "program files" foler link in windows
2006-09-13T07:13:00.000Z	jrib	Flux_	most user applications will get the binaries installed there afaik
2006-09-13T07:19:00.000Z	Flux_	jrib	ok so when I doubleclick an application in the usr/bin dir why isnt the executable running?
2006-09-13T07:19:00.000Z	jrib	Flux_	which application
