2008-02-17T11:06:00.000Z	fr500	icesword	first of all verify the interface is up, can you ping your on ip address?
2008-02-17T11:07:00.000Z	fr500	icesword	even better, are you getting leases from the dcp server?
2008-02-17T11:07:00.000Z	icesword	fr500	pardon?get lease?
2008-02-17T11:08:00.000Z	fr500	icesword	on a terminal type dhclient, it should give you an ip address, that is a lease
2008-02-17T11:08:00.000Z	fr500	icesword	otherwise, maybe a firewall on the other box?
2008-02-17T11:09:00.000Z	icesword	fr500	yes,it has a firewall
2008-02-17T11:09:00.000Z	fr500	icesword	can you ping your default gateway?
2008-02-17T11:09:00.000Z	icesword	fr500	sure ican
2008-02-17T11:10:00.000Z	fr500	icesword	then you should set the firewall to permit ICMP packets from your ubuntu box
2008-02-17T11:10:00.000Z	icesword	fr500	i will give it a try
2008-02-17T11:12:00.000Z	icesword	fr500	i have tried that,it didnot work

2008-02-17T11:15:00.000Z	fr500	icesword	maybe you have the firewall?
