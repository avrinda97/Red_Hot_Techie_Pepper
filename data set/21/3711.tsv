2008-10-15T11:11:00.000Z	DCPom	jay-menon	what is on your about:plugins page?
2008-10-15T11:12:00.000Z	jay-menon	DCPom	currently i removed Shockwave flash player
2008-10-15T11:13:00.000Z	DCPom	jay-menon	you'll probably think this is a dumb question, but did you quit firefox after isntalling?

2008-10-15T11:39:00.000Z	DCPom	jay-menon	is there a grey box there?
2008-10-15T11:40:00.000Z	DCPom	jay-menon	what does about:plugins say?
2008-10-15T11:41:00.000Z	DCPom	jay-menon	in the firefox browser put about:plugins as the URL
2008-10-15T11:43:00.000Z	DCPom	jay-menon	can you put that page on pastebin?
2008-10-15T11:49:00.000Z	DCPom	jay-menon	so paste your about:plugins page there then give me the URL it spits out
2008-10-15T11:51:00.000Z	DCPom	jay-menon	it's about:plugins  no .com
2008-10-15T11:57:00.000Z	DCPom	jay-menon	i read it, did you relaunch after you installed it?
2008-10-15T11:59:00.000Z	jay-menon	DCPom	any idea to solve this
2008-10-15T11:59:00.000Z	DCPom	jay-menon	 not yet...
2008-10-15T12:01:00.000Z	DCPom	jay-menon	it's okay i struggled with flash for awhile too
