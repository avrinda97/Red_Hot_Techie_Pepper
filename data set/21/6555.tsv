2007-03-10T08:17:00.000Z	genii	NexusGS	Which ubuntu version are you trying to get them working with?
2007-03-10T08:18:00.000Z	NexusGS	genii	6.10
2007-03-10T08:19:00.000Z	genii	NexusGS	I am seeing on some forums that the NIC at least needs kernel version 2.6.18 or later with sis900 module as driver. What kernel does command  uname -r    report for you?
2007-03-10T08:19:00.000Z	NexusGS		genii:i use default installation's kernel...
2007-03-10T08:20:00.000Z	genii	NexusGS	Then likely it is 2.6.10
2007-03-10T08:21:00.000Z	NexusGS		genii:i quess so...i will download it to another partition and compile..or is there any other way to do it so that i can load this kernel at installation?
2007-03-10T08:22:00.000Z	genii	NexusGS	You should be able to install it from the update manager (eg: synaptic or adept)
2007-03-10T08:23:00.000Z	NexusGS		genni: without a net connection,i cannot :/
2007-03-10T08:24:00.000Z	genii	NexusGS	Ah, OK. So then, on another box to download the .deb file for it, then transport the file to the box and do a dpkg -i filename.deb
2007-03-10T08:25:00.000Z	NexusGS	genii	Give me a hand plz..I don't have any other box :/ Can you tell me where i can find it?
2007-03-10T08:25:00.000Z	genii	NexusGS	I will see if I can find a direct link
2007-03-10T08:25:00.000Z	NexusGS	genii	Thank you very much
2007-03-10T08:29:00.000Z	NexusGS	genii	found anything?
2007-03-10T08:29:00.000Z	genii		not yet
2007-03-10T08:33:00.000Z	genii	NexusGS	It seems there will not be a 2.6.18 kernel for Edgy, as per here: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=256679
2007-03-10T08:33:00.000Z	NexusGS	genii	yet nothing?
