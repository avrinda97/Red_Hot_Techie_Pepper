2006-05-13T09:40:00.000Z	rendo		  I am aware of what I have done and looked it up on google but don't understand exactly what I'm supposed to change in the host file (should have made a backup cause I'm an idiot)  Anyone know what I need to do to fix this?
2006-05-13T09:41:00.000Z	nickrud	rendo	you need to edit /etc/hostname , and /etc/hosts; mine is 127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost telemon
2006-05-13T09:43:00.000Z	nickrud	rendo	yes. also, you'd have the first line of /etc/hosts like mine, but ubuntu instead of telemon
2006-05-13T09:43:00.000Z	rendo	nickrud	Hrm, it's still doing it, I'll try rebooting. :/
2006-05-25T13:55:00.000Z	nickrud	rendo	what issue?
2006-05-25T13:57:00.000Z	nickrud	rendo	the page https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ThunderbirdNewVersion has instructions for setting up thunderbird properly for breezy
2006-05-25T13:59:00.000Z	nickrud	rendo	false alarm :) Start with the next section :) I tried that page a while ago to test thunderbird under breezy, worked for me. Of course, I hate thunderbird
2006-05-25T14:03:00.000Z	nickrud	rendo	there's no script on that page, it's step by step instructions about what to enter into a terminal.
2006-05-25T14:07:00.000Z	nickrud	rendo	where did you install thunderbird to?
2006-05-27T09:41:00.000Z	nickrud	rendo	I'd point you at the top of http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats to start, then the debian-legal iist
2006-05-27T09:42:00.000Z	nickrud	rendo	erm, don't go to debian-legal. That would be masochistic
2006-05-27T09:44:00.000Z	nickrud	rendo	the conversion thingo would be resricted, no games :)
2006-06-13T10:29:00.000Z	nickrud	rendo	I do what I can do :)
2006-06-17T07:16:00.000Z	nickrud	rendo	I used BusID in my driver definition
2006-06-17T07:19:00.000Z	nickrud	rendo	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/15840 has a fragment from my xorg.conf, and the relevant lspci stuff for the card.
2006-06-17T07:19:00.000Z	nickrud	rendo	I did that cuz for some reason I couldn't disable the onboard video in bios
2006-06-17T07:21:00.000Z	nickrud	rendo	if lspci only shows one card, you shouldn't even need to use the busid stuff then
2006-06-17T07:24:00.000Z	rendo	nickrud	Thanks anyways.  Too much hassle just for a livecd show for the mother in law.
2006-06-17T07:24:00.000Z	nickrud	rendo	ar ;)
2006-06-17T07:24:00.000Z	rendo	nickrud	 I just need to show her Ubuntu is better than Windows, and I'm sure the nvidia drivers will install with a proper install.
