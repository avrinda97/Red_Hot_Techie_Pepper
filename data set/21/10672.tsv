2005-01-09T11:58:00.000Z	da_bon_bon	gen	getting the latest version
2005-01-09T11:59:00.000Z	gen	da_bon_bon	i still don't understand what you're trying to do, resize? add a partition?
2005-01-09T12:00:00.000Z	da_bon_bon	gen	i just _try_ to resize and it gives the error.
2005-01-09T12:00:00.000Z	da_bon_bon	gen	no. i downloaded latest and am trying out.
2005-01-09T12:00:00.000Z	da_bon_bon	gen	why does qtparted does not fit on my screen even on 1024x768 ?
2005-01-09T12:02:00.000Z	da_bon_bon	gen	ok. does it happen to u too ?
2005-01-09T12:02:00.000Z	gen	da_bon_bon	on bigger drives yes
2005-01-09T12:03:00.000Z	da_bon_bon	gen	ok. thanks. i am trying now.
2005-01-09T12:04:00.000Z	da_bon_bon	gen	i have used it before. dont i need to unmount disks before changing ?
2005-01-09T12:05:00.000Z	gen	da_bon_bon	it won't let you do anything to mounted disks anyhow, you said you're doing it off knoppix so they shouldnt be mounted anyway
2005-01-09T12:05:00.000Z	da_bon_bon	gen	no, currently i am on ubuntu
2005-01-09T12:09:00.000Z	da_bon_bon	gen	again, "An error happen during ped_file_system_open_call"
