2011-09-09T19:11:00.000Z	karmst		or whatever boot manager you are using
2011-09-09T19:12:00.000Z	karmst		why can't you?
2011-09-09T19:12:00.000Z	karmst		just write GRUB from scratch?
2011-09-09T19:12:00.000Z	karmst		don't do all that
2011-09-09T19:13:00.000Z	karmst		edit fstab to mount your OS partition
2011-09-09T19:13:00.000Z	karmst		then edit grub to use that as the boot
2011-09-09T19:13:00.000Z	karmst		pretty easy
2011-09-09T19:13:00.000Z	karmst		sure
2011-09-09T19:14:00.000Z	karmst		it's linux
2011-09-09T19:14:00.000Z	karmst		you can have it mount a NFS share and boot from it if you would want to

2011-09-09T19:15:00.000Z	karmst	edbian	then you obviously don't know how storage actually works
2011-09-09T19:16:00.000Z	karmst		AcidRain: is it a raid array?
2011-09-09T19:16:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	karmst	what do you mean by raid array? i have 1 internal drive that SHOULD be booted from first by the bios order. and i have 2 external drives
2011-09-09T19:17:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain		the 2 external is the issue
2011-09-09T19:18:00.000Z	karmst		what is the first line in your grub?
2011-09-09T19:18:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	karmst	the first in my grub is the internal drive. yet when the externals are hooked up and i boot my comp, it still tries to boot from them firsdt
2011-09-09T19:19:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	karmst	it ONLY tries to boot from them first when i have used their UUID in the fstab. if i dont use that, then it boots from internal
2011-09-09T19:19:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	karmst	BUT if i use uuid then it mounts them as Server Server Server2 Server2. what appears to be 2 times
2011-09-09T19:20:00.000Z	karmst		that's weird
2011-09-09T19:20:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	karmst	if i could take a ss of my Places menu for you. you would see more what im talking about
