2007-01-01T16:56:00.000Z	sharp15		ok. i'm confused.  i know ubuntu is gnome based, but i installed kde.  is there a reason that would mess with sshd and proftpd?
2007-01-01T16:56:00.000Z	mnoir	sharp15	no
2007-01-01T16:56:00.000Z	mnoir	sharp15	and ubuntu is debian based, using the gnome window manager, among others :)
2007-01-01T16:57:00.000Z	sharp15	mnoir	that's what i meant.
2007-01-01T16:57:00.000Z	mnoir	sharp15	so what is sshd doing (or not) :}
2007-01-01T16:58:00.000Z	sharp15	mnoir	failing before connection attempt.  may have something to do with xinetd.
2007-01-01T16:58:00.000Z	mnoir	sharp15	maybe - log messages?
2007-01-01T16:58:00.000Z	mnoir	sharp15	sshd is usually rock solid
2007-01-01T16:58:00.000Z	sharp15	mnoir	it's not being run by xinetd, but inetd has thrown a huge number of errors.
2007-01-01T16:59:00.000Z	mnoir	sharp15	oic :(
2007-01-01T17:00:00.000Z	sharp15	mnoir	either way. i can't find error messages from either sshd or proftpd.  both init scripts print "Starting service   [fail] "
2007-01-01T17:01:00.000Z	mnoir	sharp15	possible problem in the conf file - it sounds like to me
2007-01-02T17:02:00.000Z	mnoir	sharp15	you trying anything fancy?
2007-01-02T17:02:00.000Z	sharp15	mnoir	except they were working fine yesterday and i haven't changed anything.
2007-01-02T17:03:00.000Z	sharp15	mnoir	nothing fancy.  sshd is allowing a user with a local account to login remotely, proftpd is sharing a couple of files, both only for my home network.
2007-01-02T17:03:00.000Z	mnoir	sharp15	i dunno then.  the fact that both are screwing up is a clue
2007-01-02T17:04:00.000Z	mnoir	sharp15	i am having problems coming up with the common thing
2007-01-02T17:05:00.000Z	sharp15	mnoir	i'll try removing xinetd from the runlevel and rebooting.  that's the last thing i changed.
2007-01-02T17:05:00.000Z	mnoir	sharp15	pls let me know
2007-01-02T17:05:00.000Z	sharp15	mnoir	will do.
2007-01-02T17:47:00.000Z	sharp15	mnoir	uhh. removing xinetd didn't work.
