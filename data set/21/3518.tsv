2009-07-04T13:47:00.000Z	dury	JECHO	you know ..... there is an add on in firefox called Flash Video Resources Downloader  see?... so  you get a .mp4 file. The question is:  is there an application to convert that file .mp4 to .wav file?
2009-07-04T13:48:00.000Z	JECHO	dury	that is your question to me?
2009-07-04T13:48:00.000Z	dury	JECHO	yeah
2009-07-04T13:48:00.000Z	JECHO	dury	you can convert basically any video format but instead of using that firefox plugin... install youtube-dl (sudo apt-get install youtube-dl)
2009-07-04T13:49:00.000Z	JECHO	dury	thatll give you a .flv video instead of mp4 :)
2009-07-04T13:49:00.000Z	JECHO	dury	otherwise yo ucan convert it with mffpeg
2009-07-04T13:51:00.000Z	JECHO	dury	ffmpeg*
2009-07-04T13:51:00.000Z	dury	JECHO	the thing is that I only interested the sound of the video that's all
2009-07-04T13:52:00.000Z	JECHO	dury	oh i see.... im not aware of any way to jsut convert the audio
2009-07-04T13:54:00.000Z	dury	JECHO	sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
2009-07-04T13:56:00.000Z	JECHO	dury	i believe it is installed on ubuntu by default as a CLI utility but there is a gui for it... search for "ffmpeg" in the add/remove programs area. youll see it
2009-07-04T13:58:00.000Z	dury	JECHO	the thing is that I only interested the sound of the video that's all
