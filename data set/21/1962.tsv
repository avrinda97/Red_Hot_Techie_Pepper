2010-06-24T09:49:00.000Z	philsf	ddilinger	I do
2010-06-24T09:27:00.000Z	ddilinger	philsf	apt-get autoclean does that :P
2010-06-24T09:28:00.000Z	philsf	ddilinger	won't it delete everything?
2010-06-24T09:28:00.000Z	philsf	ddilinger	or all packages older than X days, ftm?
2010-06-24T09:28:00.000Z	ddilinger	philsf	autoclean?  no autoclean just removes versions that are older than available in sources.list
2010-06-24T09:29:00.000Z	ddilinger	philsf	so if the package is still valid from ubuntu, it will stay in your local repo
2010-06-24T09:30:00.000Z	philsf	ddilinger	brilliant, thanks!
2010-06-24T09:48:00.000Z	ddilinger	philsf	do you use emacs?  could probably remove it
2010-06-24T09:50:00.000Z	philsf	ddilinger	anyway, I use acroread to open PDFs inside firefox, and it gives an error everytime I try to open one
2010-06-24T09:50:00.000Z	ddilinger	philsf	thats annoying.  Could try using okular to read pdfs(doesn't fix the problem, but its a possiblity)
2010-06-24T09:50:00.000Z	ddilinger	philsf	okular is like, kde's pdf reader i think
2010-06-24T09:51:00.000Z	philsf	ddilinger	i only use acroread from firefox. otherwise I use evince
2010-06-24T09:52:00.000Z	ddilinger	philsf	convince firefox to use evince? :P  i cant even think of why acroread would be touching emacs
2010-06-24T09:52:00.000Z	philsf	ddilinger	I'm not assuming they
2010-06-24T09:52:00.000Z	philsf	ddilinger	I'm not assuming they're related :)
2010-06-24T09:53:00.000Z	ddilinger	philsf	oh? i thought you said they both output the same error code which had the emacs .c file listed :P
2010-06-24T09:53:00.000Z	philsf	ddilinger	they do, apart from the process name :)
2010-06-24T09:54:00.000Z	ddilinger	philsf	silly question, but dbus is running?
2010-06-24T09:57:00.000Z	philsf	ddilinger	pgrep returns 3 PIDs
2010-06-24T09:57:00.000Z	ddilinger	philsf	hmm, that should be right ... dunno
