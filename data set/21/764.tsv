2011-11-11T07:33:00.000Z	apwbdjp	dr_willis	I find byobu not so suitable for small terminals (netbook again). Never tried tmux really
2011-11-11T07:34:00.000Z	dr_willis	apwbdjp	 oh? i use it over ssh on my android phone. smaller then a netbook...

2011-11-11T07:36:00.000Z	apwbdjp	dr_willis	I'd kill for something like that..
2011-11-11T07:36:00.000Z	apwbdjp	dr_willis	I heard lxde runs fine on rooted android?
2011-11-12T18:00:00.000Z	apwbdjp	dr_willis	funny, the "ddrescue" package contains dd_rescue. And the gddrescue package contains ddrescue ^^

2011-11-13T09:58:00.000Z	apwbdjp	dr_willis	he's on the same machine, just trying to move them from windows to ubuntu.
2011-11-13T09:59:00.000Z	dr_willis	apwbdjp	 sync extensions will still work B-)
2011-11-13T10:00:00.000Z	apwbdjp	dr_willis	they surely will.. actually you're very right, it's more practical.
2011-11-13T10:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	apwbdjp	main reason i switched to chrome. :-)
2011-11-13T10:02:00.000Z	apwbdjp	dr_willis	I love chrome, if only it had a vimperator extention.. (it has things like it, a little, but still)
2011-11-13T10:21:00.000Z	apwbdjp	dr_willis	Nichola bought a new machine with Win7 on it, fully working. he's trying to install Ubuntu on it, but whatever way he tried (USB Drive, Minimal CD on USB drive, Minimal CD on actual CD), the installer hangs at the first couple of steps.
2011-11-13T10:24:00.000Z	apwbdjp	dr_willis	I'm in love with Linux for this kind of things.. I'd like to try this up with Windows ^^
