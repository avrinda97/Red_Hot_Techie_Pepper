2009-01-11T10:06:00.000Z	snowveil		k quick question, I just formatted my hard drive, and it appears to have formatted fine, it's added to my fstab, but I don't have permissions to add/unmount it...how would I change this? chmod?
2009-01-11T10:07:00.000Z	macvr	snowveil	change the permissions in the AUTHORIZATIONS> HAL

2009-01-11T10:12:00.000Z	macvr	snowveil	then u should be able to mount/unmount if u have hte permissions set correctly.... if not what is the error u get when u try to mount?
2009-01-11T10:12:00.000Z	snowveil		can not read/write mount or unmount except as root
2009-01-11T10:13:00.000Z	macvr	snowveil	select grant and select the user and select no constraint, that should do it...

2009-01-11T10:20:00.000Z	macvr	snowveil	in fstab u only need to mention the root , home , swap partitons ...... thats wierd , i'm not sure why u r not able to write , try restarting X or reebooting and check if the problem still exists
