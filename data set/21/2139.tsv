2010-02-07T23:01:00.000Z	KarmaJones		Why does my trash can show "no items in trash" even after I put things in it?
2010-02-07T23:03:00.000Z	ikonia	KarmaJones	how are you deleting it ?
2010-02-07T23:03:00.000Z	KarmaJones	ikonia	just by pressing delte
2010-02-07T23:07:00.000Z	ikonia	KarmaJones	what application are you deleting it in
2010-02-07T23:08:00.000Z	KarmaJones	ikonia	blakkheim, erUSUL, just regular delete, using the keyboard, from the computer harddrive (not removable drives)
2010-02-07T23:09:00.000Z	ikonia	KarmaJones	what application are you deleting in
2010-02-07T23:09:00.000Z	KarmaJones	ikonia	no application, just from the desktop and folders
2010-02-07T23:10:00.000Z	ikonia	KarmaJones	to delete from "folders" you must be using an application, such as nautilus
2010-02-07T23:10:00.000Z	ikonia	KarmaJones	how are you launching nautilus ?
2010-02-07T23:13:00.000Z	KarmaJones	ikonia	I'm not sure it's nautilus, I'm just deleting item from the Ubuntu desktop by pressing delete on the keyboard...(regular old delete.) I think the problem comes from the fact that I changed the language in Ubuntu from French to English in the folder got mixed up in the name switch..
2010-02-07T23:13:00.000Z	ikonia	KarmaJones	the language has nothing to do with it
2010-02-07T23:13:00.000Z	KarmaJones	ikonia	ok
2010-02-07T23:16:00.000Z	KarmaJones	ikonia	thanks I'll check this out
2010-02-07T23:16:00.000Z	ikonia	KarmaJones	permissions would be a common issue
2010-02-07T23:16:00.000Z	KarmaJones	ikonia	ok cool
2010-02-07T23:24:00.000Z	KarmaJones	ikonia	I found the trash folder (~/.local/share/Trash) with all the deleted files in it  (I also checked permissions, and all was good), but my desktop trash applet still doesn't work. I can't empty my trash.
2010-02-07T23:25:00.000Z	ikonia	KarmaJones	interesting, the files are in there, so it sounds like the applets bugged
2010-02-07T23:25:00.000Z	KarmaJones	ikonia	yeah I think you're right
2010-02-07T23:35:00.000Z	KarmaJones	ikonia	help! I just typed "sudo rm -fr /home/*/.local/share/Trash" in terminal after reading a UbuntuForums post. It didn't fix my trash applet problem and I don't know where the trash folder is now.
2010-02-07T23:35:00.000Z	ikonia	KarmaJones	you're trash folder is exactly where it was before, however it looks like you've just deleted it
2010-02-07T23:36:00.000Z	KarmaJones	ikonia	ok...
