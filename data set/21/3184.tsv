2009-03-11T03:01:00.000Z	drcrazy		whats this 127.0.1.1 ip for ?
2009-03-11T03:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drcrazy	localhost
2009-03-11T03:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drcrazy	same
2009-03-11T03:02:00.000Z	drcrazy	ActionParsnip	weird
2009-03-11T03:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drcrazy	why?
2009-03-11T03:02:00.000Z	drcrazy	ActionParsnip	don't take my words as is :)
2009-03-11T03:04:00.000Z	drcrazy	ActionParsnip	I just reinstalled my OS and i had in my /etc/hosts 127.0.0.1       localhost \n 127.0.1.1      machineName.    This caused my Apache2 to tell me that it couldn't resolve the qualitified domain name. I changed the /etc/hosts to contain on the first line: 127.0.0.1       localhost.localdomain   localhost       machineName   (and haven't changed the second line) and all works fine now :O/
2009-03-11T03:06:00.000Z	drcrazy	ActionParsnip	I guess it works cuz now it finds 127.0.0.1 as my machineName (which is my /etc/hostname)
2009-03-11T03:06:00.000Z	drcrazy	ActionParsnip	can you tell me if I missed something in that /etc/hosts file ?
2009-03-11T03:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drcrazy	can you pastebin the file
2009-03-11T03:10:00.000Z	drcrazy	ActionParsnip	http://paste.ubuntu.com/129560/
2009-03-11T03:14:00.000Z	drcrazy	ActionParsnip	can you let me know if something isn't well done in my changes : http://paste.ubuntu.com/129560/ :)
2009-03-11T03:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drcrazy	some apps use 127.0.0.1 as localhost, some use 127.0.1.1 i have an identical hosts file. makes stuffgo faster too (some website advised it)
2009-03-11T03:17:00.000Z	drcrazy	ActionParsnip	ok, so, specifying that "machineName" is available on both IP is ok ? (I guess it would fallback always on the first one, right ?)
2009-03-11T03:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drcrazy	sure, 127.x.x.x is a local device
2009-03-11T03:17:00.000Z	drcrazy	ActionParsnip	can I remove the 127.0.1.1 entry ?
2009-03-11T03:18:00.000Z	drcrazy	ActionParsnip	safely that is :)
2009-03-11T03:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drcrazy	comment it out, if it works ok leave it, if not then uncomment
2009-03-11T03:19:00.000Z	drcrazy	ActionParsnip	thanks!
2009-03-11T03:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drcrazy	deleting stuff is a bit OTT, commenting is easier so you can roll back
2009-03-11T04:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drcrazy	try lshw
