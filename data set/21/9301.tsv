2005-10-10T07:41:00.000Z	sunsun		hi i can't burn cdrecord doesnt see my cdburner
2005-10-10T07:42:00.000Z	sunsun		cdrecord -v -dev=ATA: -scanbus gives problems with /dev/hda which is obviously not right
2005-10-10T07:42:00.000Z	bob2	sunsun	ignore that
2005-10-10T07:42:00.000Z	bob2	sunsun	sudo cdrecord -v dev=/dev/hda foo.iso
2005-10-10T07:42:00.000Z	bob2	sunsun	it will give warnings, but that's only because the cdrecord author has a crackpipe the size of my house
2005-10-10T07:43:00.000Z	sunsun	bob2	it says error trying to open /dev/hda exclusively device or resource busy?
2005-10-10T07:43:00.000Z	bob2	sunsun	mount | grep hda
2005-10-10T07:44:00.000Z	sunsun	bob2	ok /dev/hda1 on / and /dev/hda6 on /home?
2005-10-10T07:44:00.000Z	bob2	sunsun	right, trying to burn using a hard disk probably won't work ;)
2005-10-10T07:45:00.000Z	sunsun	bob2	i think you have a crackpipe the size of your house
2005-10-10T07:45:00.000Z	bob2	sunsun	ok!
2005-10-10T07:46:00.000Z	bob2	sunsun	eh?  you need to point it at your cd burner
2005-10-10T07:46:00.000Z	bob2	sunsun	hda is a hard disk
2005-10-10T07:47:00.000Z	bob2	sunsun	presumably hdc would be your burner
2005-10-10T07:47:00.000Z	bob2	sunsun	there's no equivalent of testing
2005-10-10T07:48:00.000Z	sunsun	bob2	what does grep | cat do?
2005-10-10T07:48:00.000Z	bob2	sunsun	nothing
2005-10-10T07:48:00.000Z	sunsun	bob2	oh.  what about grep | xmms
2005-10-10T07:49:00.000Z	bob2	sunsun	that also does nothing
2005-10-10T07:50:00.000Z	sunsun	bob2	oh i meant xmms | grep what does that do?
2005-10-10T07:52:00.000Z	bob2	sunsun	ignore that, just find out what your burner is called some other way
