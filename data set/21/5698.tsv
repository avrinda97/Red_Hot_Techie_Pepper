2007-08-29T11:35:00.000Z	Flannel	Reqtangle	~/public_html has to be readable by www-data (a+r) and therefore ~/ has to be a+r as well
2007-08-29T11:35:00.000Z	Flannel	Reqtangle	userdir is already enabled (by default) and you wouldn't modify any config files to enable it if it weren't anyway.
2007-08-29T11:35:00.000Z	Reqtangle	Flannel	i'm new to linux, could you translate for me please?
2007-08-29T11:36:00.000Z	Flannel	Reqtangle	you need to make sure your homedir is readable by all, and make sure ~/public_html is (and any files inside of it too)
2007-08-29T11:37:00.000Z	Reqtangle	Flannel	do you mind showing me how to do that?
2007-08-29T11:37:00.000Z	Flannel	Reqtangle	sudo chmod a+r /home/username /home/username/public_html
2007-08-29T11:37:00.000Z	Flannel	Reqtangle	a is all, +r means 'set the read flag' then the two directories
2007-08-29T11:42:00.000Z	Flannel	Reqtangle	is userdir.conf and .load in /etc/apache2/mods-enabled?
2007-08-29T11:43:00.000Z	Flannel	Reqtangle	please don't paste here.  Just check to see if you see userdir.conf and .load
2007-08-29T11:44:00.000Z	Flannel	Reqtangle	this is feisty?
2007-08-29T11:45:00.000Z	Flannel	Reqtangle	alright, go ahead and do this: `sudo a2enmod userdir`
2007-08-29T11:48:00.000Z	Reqtangle	Flannel	typed cmd in, i'll see if i can find my way from here on
