2006-03-30T16:23:00.000Z	Healot		Shared License isn;t GPL-like
2006-03-30T16:25:00.000Z	Healot		MSL doesn't allow that...
2006-03-30T16:26:00.000Z	Healot		yes... when it prompts you to accept certs
2006-03-30T16:27:00.000Z	Healot		ok...
2006-03-30T16:27:00.000Z	Healot		first hint...
2006-03-30T16:27:00.000Z	Auckland_Pig	Healot	is it about firefox?
2006-03-30T16:28:00.000Z	Healot		nay, MSL, Microsoft Shared License
2006-03-30T16:28:00.000Z	Healot		"subject to the restrictions in this license" >> impiled restrictions...
2006-03-30T16:29:00.000Z	Healot		"You may not use or distribute this Software or any derivative works in any form for commercial purposes"
2006-03-30T16:30:00.000Z	Healot		thus you cannot port/derivate the source other than non-profit activities... which is not really "open" since MS makes money out of many OSS
2006-03-30T16:31:00.000Z	Healot		you must be able to do anything with the original code, to be considered "open"
2006-03-30T16:31:00.000Z	Healot		like BSD/GPL
2006-03-30T16:32:00.000Z	Healot		except GPL derived works must be licensed the same license GPL
2006-03-30T16:32:00.000Z	Healot		yes... drbreen
2006-03-30T16:33:00.000Z	Healot		btw the check wether MSL is categorized as OSS license,,, just goto OSS
2006-03-30T16:33:00.000Z	Healot	Afief	MS will never do a OSS license
2006-03-30T16:34:00.000Z	Healot		yeah... would be great...
2006-03-30T16:35:00.000Z	Healot		you are entitled to do ANYTHING with a true OSS license like BSD/MIT license, no restriction whatsoever, even doing proprietary code/binary from it :)
2006-03-30T16:36:00.000Z	Auckland_Pig		when i click "System -> Preferences -> Multimedia Selector" i get an error message "Cannot launch entry" what is that?
2006-03-30T16:36:00.000Z	Healot		http://www.opensource.org/licenses/ >> there isn't any MSL here :)
2006-03-30T16:36:00.000Z	Auckland_Pig	Healot	whats the difference b/w MIT and public domain?
