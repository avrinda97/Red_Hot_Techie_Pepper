2009-06-22T05:05:00.000Z	geirha	MrKeuner	via ssh?
2009-06-22T05:05:00.000Z	MrKeuner	geirha	yes
2009-06-22T05:06:00.000Z	geirha	MrKeuner	Try with: DISPLAY=:0 xset dpms force suspend
2009-06-22T05:06:00.000Z	MrKeuner	geirha	actual problem is, when I vnc into that system, system's monitor wake up. I'd like to prevent that.
2009-06-22T05:07:00.000Z	geirha	MrKeuner	Then don't use vnc. Try !freenx instead
2009-06-22T05:10:00.000Z	MrKeuner	geirha	thanks so much! for pointing me to that project. Is that a remote Xorg login + safety?
2009-06-22T05:11:00.000Z	geirha	MrKeuner	In short, it logs in with ssh and starts a login screen. On top of that it uses compression and caching to make it faster.
2009-06-22T05:12:00.000Z	geirha	MrKeuner	So you don't need to be logged in locally like you do with vnc
2009-06-22T05:12:00.000Z	MrKeuner	geirha	yes that was another problem.
2009-06-22T05:13:00.000Z	MrKeuner	geirha	do you by any chance know if I can remotely check if a display is turned on or off?
2009-06-22T05:15:00.000Z	geirha	MrKeuner	It should be possible, but I don't know how
2009-06-22T05:16:00.000Z	MrKeuner	geirha	thank you
2009-06-22T05:16:00.000Z	geirha	MrKeuner	Do you mean whether it's suspended or powered of btw?
2009-06-22T05:16:00.000Z	MrKeuner	geirha	powered off
2009-06-22T05:17:00.000Z	MrKeuner	geirha	I see that /proc/acpi/video may not be standard for all systems
2009-06-22T05:19:00.000Z	geirha	MrKeuner	If you are logged in localy (graphically), and ssh in and run "DISPLAY=:0 xrandr", I believe it should have different output depending on whether it detects a connected monitor, but without a running Xserver, I don't know ...
2009-06-22T05:39:00.000Z	MrKeuner	geirha	hehe also much faster than vnc
2009-06-22T05:40:00.000Z	geirha	MrKeuner	You've gotten freenx set up I take it? :)
2009-06-22T05:40:00.000Z	MrKeuner	geirha	up and running
2009-06-22T05:46:00.000Z	MrKeuner	geirha	is there a gpl client for freenx as well?
2009-06-22T05:47:00.000Z	geirha	MrKeuner	Yes, qtnx
