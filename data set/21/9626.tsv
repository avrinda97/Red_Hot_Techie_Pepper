2005-10-26T08:45:00.000Z	Renski	CGA	what user does it say the USB Drive belongs to?
2005-10-26T08:46:00.000Z	CGA		is it the one in the above mount output? isn't it?
2005-10-26T08:46:00.000Z	Renski	CGA	ls -l [path to the USB drive] 
2005-10-26T08:46:00.000Z	CGA	Renski	going to check
2005-10-26T08:47:00.000Z	Renski	CGA	Ive got a feeling I know why.

2005-10-26T08:47:00.000Z	CGA		arf
2005-10-26T08:47:00.000Z	Renski		I thought maybe it was set to root, as ubuntu doesnt use root, it would make much sense to have it 777
2005-10-26T08:48:00.000Z	Renski		*wouldn
2005-10-26T08:48:00.000Z	Renski		*wouldnt
2005-10-26T08:48:00.000Z	CGA		k
2005-10-26T08:48:00.000Z	CGA	Renski	do you think i can set it up in fstab or will it conflict with hal?
2005-10-26T08:48:00.000Z	Renski	CGA	you can fix it though by typing chmod 777 [path to mounted drive] 
2005-10-26T08:49:00.000Z	Renski	CGA	no idea
