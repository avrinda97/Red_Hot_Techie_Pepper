2004-10-19T10:19:00.000Z	LeeColleton	phlaegel	I'm trying to build tomboy but ./configure is complaining that I don't have package 'gdk-2.0'
2004-10-19T10:26:00.000Z	LeeColleton	phlaegel	sorry, another tomboy ./configure snag;  No package 'gtk-sharp' found.  apt-cache doesn't show it
2004-10-19T10:34:00.000Z	LeeColleton	phlaegel	I agree that state of mind pervades many computer users, but it's one that can and should change.
2004-10-19T10:49:00.000Z	LeeColleton	phlaegel	so it is.  Is there a list of these packages somewhere?
2004-10-19T10:46:00.000Z	phlaegel	LeeColleton	I got it from the tseng's source along with the other mono stuff
2004-10-19T10:46:00.000Z	LeeColleton	phlaegel	got it
2004-10-19T10:47:00.000Z	LeeColleton	phlaegel	now it's complaining there is no gnome-sharp package.. what would this be called?  libgnome-something-or-other?
2004-10-19T10:48:00.000Z	phlaegel	LeeColleton	probably libgnome-cil
2004-10-19T10:52:00.000Z	LeeColleton	phlaegel	I got tomboy compiled.  Thanks for your help!
2004-10-19T12:26:00.000Z	phlaegel	LeeColleton	I never had that problem when I ran tseng's tomboy package
2004-10-19T12:28:00.000Z	LeeColleton	phlaegel	I'm thinking it's somehow vaugely related to my installation and removal of tomboy from source, followed by this buggy packaged installation
