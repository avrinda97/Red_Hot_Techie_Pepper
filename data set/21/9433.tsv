2005-11-04T06:58:00.000Z	WebLOCH		Hey guys, wondering if someone can help...  I just tried compiling some java and it told me that it couldnt resolve a symbol, that symbol being java.io haha, if anyone knows anything please help
2005-11-04T06:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	WebLOCH	jsdk or with gcj
2005-11-04T07:08:00.000Z	erUSUL	WebLOCH	well then set them properly in your bashrc or bash_profile
2005-11-04T07:08:00.000Z	WebLOCH	erUSUL	I think I have, thats where the problem arises :P
2005-11-04T07:08:00.000Z	erUSUL	WebLOCH	using jsdk?
2005-11-04T07:10:00.000Z	WebLOCH	erUSUL	using the JDK yessir, possibly blackdown
2005-11-04T07:10:00.000Z	WebLOCH	erUSUL	which I believe is SUNs modified slightly
2005-11-04T07:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	WebLOCH	well if the env vars are set correctly i do not know what the problem can be :(
2005-11-04T07:12:00.000Z	WebLOCH	erUSUL	thanks for trying anyway :)
2005-11-04T07:21:00.000Z	WebLOCH	erUSUL	which file do you edit to alter your path ?
2005-11-04T07:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	WebLOCH	export PATH=$PATH:/new/dir
2005-11-04T07:23:00.000Z	WebLOCH	erUSUL	whenever I try that it doenst hold after I reboot or log out or close the console
2005-11-04T07:23:00.000Z	WebLOCH	erUSUL	to create the JAVA_HOME variable I had to edit bash.bashrc
2005-11-04T07:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	WebLOCH	, do the same for the path var, put the export in bashrc
2005-11-04T07:24:00.000Z	WebLOCH	erUSUL	I wasnt sure if it was okay to do that without it affecting other places that contrain the PATH variable, like profile
2005-11-04T07:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	WebLOCH	no problem in doing this
2005-11-04T07:26:00.000Z	WebLOCH	erUSUL	if this works ill give you your very own megabyte of space on my computer
2005-11-04T07:26:00.000Z	WebLOCH	erUSUL	ill call it USULSPACE
2005-11-04T07:27:00.000Z	WebLOCH	erUSUL	do i need to reboot to affect the changes?
2005-11-04T07:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	WebLOCH	you are welcome. nice to get a whole MB for my own... ;)
2005-11-04T07:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	WebLOCH	no just reopen the terminal emulator
