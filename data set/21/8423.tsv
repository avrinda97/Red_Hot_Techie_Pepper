2006-04-08T14:16:00.000Z	roico		any1 using anjuta?
2006-04-08T14:16:00.000Z	slhk	roico	I never used anjuta to debug, try ddd
2006-04-08T14:16:00.000Z	roico	slhk	whats ddd?
2006-04-08T14:17:00.000Z	slhk	roico	it's another frontend to gdb
2006-04-08T14:17:00.000Z	slhk	roico	it's not really nice to see, but you can debug any program
2006-04-08T14:18:00.000Z	roico	slhk	so why cant i debug with anjuta?
2006-04-08T14:18:00.000Z	slhk	roico	no idea... did you install gdb?
2006-04-08T14:19:00.000Z	roico	slhk	sure... it can debug, but it hangs, even on the "Hello World" app...
2006-04-08T14:19:00.000Z	slhk	roico	what do you mean by "it hangs"? any error message?
2006-04-08T14:20:00.000Z	roico	slhk	no error message...
2006-04-08T14:20:00.000Z	roico	slhk	it just stop..
2006-04-08T14:21:00.000Z	slhk	roico	it stops at breakpoints and at hte end of the program to debug...
2006-04-08T14:22:00.000Z	roico	slhk	i didnt try to give him breakpoints...
2006-04-08T14:22:00.000Z	roico	slhk	i tried to debug the program fromits beggining...
2006-04-08T14:22:00.000Z	slhk	roico	then it executes the whole program and stops at the end, that's normal
2006-04-08T14:23:00.000Z	roico	slhk	it doesnt execute the program, i dont get "Hello World" msg at the terminal...
2006-04-08T14:24:00.000Z	slhk	roico	try with a breakpoint at main (the beginning of the program an follow it step-by-step
2006-04-08T14:25:00.000Z	slhk	roico	maybe the output is redirected by the debugger and it's shown on another terminal, so you may have to look elsewhere
2006-04-08T14:25:00.000Z	roico	slhk	i followed it step-by-step, but with no breakpoints, i started with f5 *step in)...
2006-04-08T14:27:00.000Z	slhk	roico	afaik you cannot begin with a "step in", you have to start the program first
2006-04-08T14:28:00.000Z	roico	slhk	it not... i think i know where it hangs, when i get to the cout... i tryed to use "step over" instead of "step in", and it gave me the "return" command at the cout function on ostram.tcc... and i can start with step in (after i start the debugger..)..
