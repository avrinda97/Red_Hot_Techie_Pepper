2005-06-26T05:34:00.000Z	karim		is hoary live/install  cd bootable on the oldworlds macs ?
2005-06-26T05:35:00.000Z	flankk	karim	ubuntu is not designed for oldworld macs, use a distro that is.
2005-06-26T05:36:00.000Z	karim	flankk	I already run a debian on it
2005-06-26T05:37:00.000Z	flankk	karim	so you have gotten around the PROM settings getting it to boot?
2005-06-26T05:37:00.000Z	flankk	karim	anyways, if you have debian on it, then you would be quite aware on how to boot the cd.
2005-06-26T05:37:00.000Z	karim	flankk	I installed from a floppy drive. I know that the debian install cd for ppc aren't bootable on oldworld. I don't know for ubuntu
2005-06-26T05:38:00.000Z	karim	flankk	no, it could only be done from floppy
2005-06-26T05:38:00.000Z	flankk	karim	no install cds are bootable on oldworld, try yellowdog linux or something designed for the job..
2005-06-26T05:39:00.000Z	karim	flankk	I ask if ubuntu install cd is bootable on oldworld, I don't ask advices on which distro to use. thanks
2005-06-26T05:39:00.000Z	flankk	karim	the answer is no, i was simply giving you a suggestion to avoid repeating myself.
2005-06-26T05:41:00.000Z	flankk	karim	besides, if you currently have debian on it, you can switch your sources to ubuntu repositories and you will have a ubuntu system that way.. i believe there is a post in the forum discussing how to do this effectively.
2005-06-26T05:42:00.000Z	karim	flankk	yes, I did that switch on a G3 400mhz, from debian to ubuntu, but I did a clean install . I just want to do a clean install
2005-06-26T05:42:00.000Z	karim	flankk	I mean I did a clean install recently, so save hard drive space
2005-06-26T05:42:00.000Z	flankk	karim	use the debian floppy to boot the kernel off the ubuntu cd then..
2005-06-26T05:43:00.000Z	karim	flankk	the reason is I discovered that aptitude can remove uneeded dependencies, unlike apt
2005-06-26T05:43:00.000Z	karim	flankk	ok, thanks
2005-06-26T05:43:00.000Z	flankk	karim	you can have aptitude on debian or ubuntu..
2005-06-26T05:44:00.000Z	karim	flankk	I didn't said the contrary. I said I want to a clean install to get space back
2005-06-26T05:44:00.000Z	karim	flankk	and that I prefer ubuntu
2005-06-26T05:44:00.000Z	flankk	karim	ok, just making sure it's clear :)
2005-06-26T05:44:00.000Z	karim	flankk	no prob :)
