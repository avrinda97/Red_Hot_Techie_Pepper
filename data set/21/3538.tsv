2008-11-30T23:50:00.000Z	depasqua		I have an edgy (6.10) release on a system that I'd like to upgrade.  What's the easiest way to do this?  Do I need to get a CD and do a full reinstall?
2008-11-30T23:50:00.000Z	wiebersk	depasqua	sudo apt-get upgarde
2008-11-30T23:50:00.000Z	wiebersk		despasqua, or sudo apt-get update
2008-11-30T23:51:00.000Z	depasqua	wiebersk	first command did little/nothing, second attempted to fetch any update files and I got lots of 404s
2008-11-30T23:51:00.000Z	wiebersk	depasqua	are you connected to the internet?
2008-11-30T23:51:00.000Z	depasqua		yes

2008-11-30T23:54:00.000Z	wiebersk	depasqua	what does it say if you go to system > administration > software sources?
2008-11-30T23:55:00.000Z	depasqua	wiebersk	it's a remote login system, I don't use the desktop.
2008-11-30T23:56:00.000Z	wiebersk	depasqua	what does your /etc/sources.lst say?
2008-11-30T23:57:00.000Z	wiebersk	depasqua	sudo nano /etc/sources.lst

2008-11-30T23:59:00.000Z	wiebersk	depasqua	what about a sudo apt-get dist-upgrade is that still 404ing

2008-12-01T00:01:00.000Z	depasqua	wiebersk	is it just easier to byte the bullet and get a CD and reinstall cleanly?
2008-12-01T00:02:00.000Z	wiebersk	depasqua	you could do that, or try changing edgy in the sources.lst to intrepid first
2008-12-01T00:02:00.000Z	wiebersk	depasqua	but i would just do a live cd
2008-12-01T00:02:00.000Z	depasqua	wiebersk	if you were me, what path would you take?
2008-12-01T00:02:00.000Z	wiebersk	depasqua	if your repositories aren't working properly
2008-12-01T00:03:00.000Z	depasqua	wiebersk	ok, live cd is is then.  thanks.
2008-12-01T00:03:00.000Z	wiebersk	depasqua	depends on what i have on there, sometimes editing the sources.lst file is bad
