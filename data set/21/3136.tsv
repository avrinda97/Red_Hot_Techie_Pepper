2009-09-12T21:33:00.000Z	grawity	ManDay	Try gnome-desktop?
2009-09-12T21:35:00.000Z	grawity	ManDay	gnome-desktop and probably gnome-session. Maybe gnome-base, I don't remember.
2009-09-12T21:39:00.000Z	ManDay	grawity	i go with ... GDM, gnome-session, thunderbird, open-office.org-writer, firefox-3.0, network-manager, wireless-tools AND ALL THEIR DEPS now, do you think this will yield a working desktop?

2009-09-12T23:17:00.000Z	grawity	ManDay	The link will explain.
2009-09-13T21:10:00.000Z	grawity	ManDay	Are you running notification-daemon or notify-osd?
2009-09-13T21:11:00.000Z	grawity	ManDay	The pretty black popups are created by notify-osd, install that.
2009-09-13T21:11:00.000Z	ManDay	grawity	neither nor.

2009-09-15T18:06:00.000Z	grawity	ManDay	What terminal are you using? gnome-terminal, xterm, Linux console, PuTTY?

2009-12-05T00:11:00.000Z	grawity	ManDay	If you want something really simple, use good old text-based login.
