2009-10-09T04:03:00.000Z	histo	[manas]	you can enable it. I believe it may be blocking the external requests with iptables
2009-10-09T04:04:00.000Z	[manas]	histo	so ftp would be more easy?
2009-10-09T04:06:00.000Z	histo	[manas]	You can do remote sharing hold up i'm reading stuff
2009-10-09T04:12:00.000Z	histo	[manas]	its not really secure to use samba that way just FYI
2009-10-09T04:12:00.000Z	histo	[manas]	I would recomend using VPN or SFTP or something similar

2009-10-09T04:13:00.000Z	[manas]	histo	which one is more easy configure?
2009-10-09T04:14:00.000Z	histo	[manas]	sftp

2009-10-09T04:18:00.000Z	histo	[manas]	if you have ssh installed then you can use sftp to connect to the box
2009-10-09T04:19:00.000Z	histo	[manas]	There are many windows clients that will work for it. putty winscp etc..
2009-10-09T04:21:00.000Z	[manas]	histo	i got ssh but this sftp doesnt look so easy to use
