2008-05-04T08:39:00.000Z	r00723r0		There is no performance difference, actually.
2008-05-04T08:39:00.000Z	r00723r0		Except for large integer calculations.
2008-05-04T08:39:00.000Z	r00723r0		Which happens very rarely.
2008-05-04T08:39:00.000Z	r00723r0		Some image processing and 3D.
2008-05-04T08:39:00.000Z	r00723r0		The move up to 64-bit is a marketing one.
2008-05-04T08:39:00.000Z	Sid1	r00723r0	4GB RAM needs 64-bit
2008-05-04T08:39:00.000Z	r00723r0		Yes, but most computers don't have 4GB.
2008-05-04T08:40:00.000Z	r00723r0		Of course, we're hitting the limit soon.
2008-05-04T08:40:00.000Z	r00723r0		But as far as 64-bit, everyone thought it was faster.
2008-05-04T08:40:00.000Z	r00723r0		Which it's not.
2008-05-04T08:40:00.000Z	r00723r0		Plus, AMD64 doesn't support true 64-bit addressing.
2008-05-04T08:40:00.000Z	r00723r0		It's only 48-bit.
2008-05-04T08:40:00.000Z	Sid1	r00723r0	Really?
2008-05-04T08:40:00.000Z	r00723r0	Sid1	yes.
2008-05-04T08:41:00.000Z	Sid1	r00723r0	AMD blows. I have AMD Turion x2, and supposedly, a 1.8GHz  Core 2 duo beats an AMD 2.2GHz
2008-05-04T08:41:00.000Z	r00723r0	Sid1	your calculations are off.
2008-05-04T08:41:00.000Z	r00723r0	Sid1	GHz does not translate to speed.
2008-05-04T08:41:00.000Z	Sid1	r00723r0	To 3DMark points?
2008-05-04T08:42:00.000Z	r00723r0	Sid1	not that either.
2008-05-04T08:42:00.000Z	r00723r0	Sid1	some processors have more efficient clock cycles.
2008-05-04T08:42:00.000Z	Sid1	r00723r0	^o)
