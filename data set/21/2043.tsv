2010-02-28T00:34:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	mawst	 are you using ioQuake when you are getting sound?  I have never gotten sound from the points release of Quake 3 for a long time.
2010-02-28T00:39:00.000Z	mawst	ZykoticK9	heh it's an interesting problem. ioquake gives me sound but puts my monitor out of scan range by default... so I use the point release.... I had to install a libsdl for pulse I think
2010-02-28T00:40:00.000Z	mawst	ZykoticK9	have a look at libsdl1.2debian-pulseaudio and try again if you feel up to it.
2010-02-28T00:40:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	mawst	thanks!
2010-02-28T00:43:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	mawst	other then installing libsdl1.2debian-pulseaudio was there anything else you had to do?  it was already installed on my system.
2010-02-28T01:29:00.000Z	mawst	ZykoticK9	did you get it working?
2010-02-28T01:32:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	mawst	nope :(  tried using 32bit version of library as well, no go.  I've tried numberous times to get Quake 3 sound working, haven't in probably 2 years
2010-02-28T02:05:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	mawst	i didn't notice you PM - thanks man, that worked!  Sound in Q3, amazing.
2010-02-28T02:07:00.000Z	mawst	ZykoticK9	cool. Glad I could help.
2010-02-28T02:08:00.000Z	mawst	ZykoticK9	keep that line you added handy though, that may get removed form the file after updates.
2010-02-28T02:09:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	mawst	if you want smp to work add the line "quake3-smp.x86 0 0 direct"
2010-02-28T02:10:00.000Z	mawst	ZykoticK9	heh why didn't I realize that.
2010-02-28T02:12:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	mawst	CS isn't a game i play - but you might be interested in the games i have running on Lucid http://sites.google.com/site/alucidfs/gaming
2010-02-28T02:13:00.000Z	mawst	ZykoticK9	nice I'll check it out
2010-03-14T07:14:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	mawst	Ubuntu does not do rolling updates - so you should never see "new" packages, just security/bug fixes
2010-03-14T07:16:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	mawst	only when a new version comes out - then there are new packages
2010-07-26T07:06:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	mawst	are you using nvidia?
2010-07-26T07:06:00.000Z	mawst	ZykoticK9	yes
2010-07-26T07:07:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	mawst	"sudo mv /etc/xorg.conf /etc/xorg.conf.orig" then "sudo nvidia-xconfig", then try restarting GDM "sudo service gdm restart"
2010-07-26T07:08:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	mawst	sorry it's /etc/X11/
2010-07-26T07:10:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	mawst	awsome!
