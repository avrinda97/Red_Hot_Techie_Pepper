2011-02-11T00:03:00.000Z	Minty	Pici	ok
2011-02-11T00:17:00.000Z	Pici	Minty	Take the install CD out of the drive.
2011-02-11T01:48:00.000Z	Pici	Minty	No, sorry.
2011-02-11T01:48:00.000Z	Minty	Pici	ok, fair enough - thanks
2011-02-11T01:48:00.000Z	Minty	Pici	i'm totally new to this - is it ok to add shortcut icons to my desktop? or does that defeat the point of using ubuntu - apologies if this question is ridiculous, i literally have no clue
2011-02-11T01:49:00.000Z	Pici	Minty	You can do whatever you want
2011-02-11T01:50:00.000Z	Minty	Pici	when i download stuff through the download centre, can i launch it through anywhere other than terminal?
2011-02-11T01:50:00.000Z	Pici	Minty	Depends what you've downloaded, most desktop applications get put into Applications>somewhere
2011-02-11T01:51:00.000Z	Minty	Pici	i downloaded vim, can't find it under applications though ;)
2011-02-11T01:52:00.000Z	Pici	Minty	Thats because vim is a command line application.  gvim provides a graphical interface.
2011-02-11T01:52:00.000Z	Minty	Pici	yea, i downloaded gvim sorry
2011-02-11T01:52:00.000Z	Minty	Pici	well i actually downloaded both, but gvim isn't in the application menu
2011-02-11T01:56:00.000Z	Pici	Minty	Its the colon key, then w
2011-02-11T01:57:00.000Z	Pici	Minty	vim/gvim is definitely not a new-user's editor.., its rather complex.
2011-02-11T01:57:00.000Z	Minty	Pici	i'm new to ubuntu - but not programming, it'll take me a short while to get used to the interface i guess, but i don't mind jumping in
2011-02-11T01:58:00.000Z	Pici	Minty	Okay :)
2011-02-11T01:58:00.000Z	Minty	Pici	colon + w didn't do anything ;) am i supposed to be holding ctrl or alt with this or somthing?
2011-02-11T01:58:00.000Z	Pici	Minty	Press esc,then type :w   and press enter.
