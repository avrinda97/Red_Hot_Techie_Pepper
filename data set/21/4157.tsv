2009-02-27T15:30:00.000Z	aperson		would anyone know why this script: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/123724/ won't run via cron?
2009-02-27T15:32:00.000Z	cumulus007	aperson	cron runs at root
2009-02-27T15:32:00.000Z	cumulus007	aperson	and cron doesn't know on which tty X runs
2009-02-27T15:32:00.000Z	cumulus007	aperson	you have to add the screen number of X to the screenshot commands
2009-02-27T15:35:00.000Z	aperson	cumulus007	it is supposed to lock the screensaver, and it is running on my user
2009-02-27T15:35:00.000Z	cumulus007	aperson	is Cron running on your user, not root?
2009-02-27T15:35:00.000Z	aperson	cumulus007	I set it up via crontab -e, not sudo crontab -e
2009-02-27T15:36:00.000Z	aperson	cumulus007	and when I tail /var/syslog it says it runs via my user
2009-02-27T15:36:00.000Z	cumulus007	aperson	I think you need to specify the screen number
2009-02-27T15:36:00.000Z	aperson	cumulus007	how would I go about that?
2009-02-27T15:37:00.000Z	cumulus007	aperson	I don't know
2009-02-27T15:39:00.000Z	cumulus007		apgot it
2009-02-27T15:39:00.000Z	cumulus007	aperson	got it
2009-02-27T15:40:00.000Z	cumulus007		run this: DISPLAY=:0.0 xhost +
2009-02-27T15:41:00.000Z	aperson	cumulus007	access control disabled, clients can connect from any host
2009-02-27T15:41:00.000Z	cumulus007	aperson	does it work now
2009-02-27T15:45:00.000Z	aperson	cumulus007	nope
2009-02-27T15:46:00.000Z	cumulus007	aperson	I'm sorry, I don't know then
2009-02-27T15:46:00.000Z	aperson	cumulus007	thanks for your help
2009-02-27T15:46:00.000Z	cumulus007		np
2009-02-27T15:58:00.000Z	aperson	cumulus007	apparently cron and gnome-screensaver-command don't work together
