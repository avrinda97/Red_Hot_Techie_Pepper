2010-06-17T16:26:00.000Z	Cavej03	dli__	drivers are all up to date (ati 4890)
2010-06-17T16:28:00.000Z	dli__	Cavej03	ati r7xx, I think you need the current development version of ati driver, or the binary only fglrx
2010-06-17T16:31:00.000Z	Cavej03	dli__	binary only fglrx could to explain a little bit more about this
