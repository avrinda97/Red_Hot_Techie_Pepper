2009-05-17T23:56:00.000Z	gordonjcp	AVGHelp	What exactly are you trying to do?

2009-05-17T23:59:00.000Z	gordonjcp	AVGHelp	it's only for servers
2009-05-18T00:00:00.000Z	gordonjcp	AVGHelp	you might use it to scan files on a server that has MS Windows machines connected to it
2009-05-18T00:01:00.000Z	AVGHelp	gordonjcp	are you saying that this link here gives an antivurs program only for servers http://free.avg.com/download?prd=afl
2009-05-18T00:01:00.000Z	gordonjcp	AVGHelp	can't look at that link just now, no web browser
2009-05-18T00:02:00.000Z	gordonjcp	AVGHelp	are you running a file server for Windows computers?
2009-05-18T00:02:00.000Z	AVGHelp	gordonjcp	ok i dissagree with your statment that it is only for servers because ther eis an instruction page in ubuntu help for isntalling it which did not work for me and i have read about installations of it on the net which also did not work for me ;)
2009-05-18T00:03:00.000Z	AVGHelp	gordonjcp	i am running ubuntu 9.04 on a nromal computer it is the only operating system on this computer and that is all
2009-05-18T00:04:00.000Z	AVGHelp	gordonjcp	but it provides an active scanner scanner in the background for viruses and that is what i am after
2009-05-18T00:05:00.000Z	gordonjcp	AVGHelp	you don't need that
2009-05-18T00:05:00.000Z	gordonjcp	AVGHelp	you only need to scan for viruses if you're serving files to Windows machines
2009-05-18T00:08:00.000Z	gordonjcp	AVGHelp	all viruses are for Microsoft Windows only, and won't affect Linux systems
2009-05-18T00:08:00.000Z	AVGHelp	gordonjcp	i dissagree
2009-05-18T00:11:00.000Z	gordonjcp	AVGHelp	put it this way, I've been using Linux for quite a while now and never even considered an antivirus program
2009-05-18T00:12:00.000Z	AVGHelp	gordonjcp	we go to different web pages you and I ;)
2009-05-18T00:12:00.000Z	gordonjcp	AVGHelp	show me a web page that says that you get viruses on Linux and I'll show you something that'll make your roses grow ;-)
2009-05-18T00:13:00.000Z	gordonjcp	AVGHelp	there are no viruses for Linux.  There isn't even the possibility.
2009-05-18T00:13:00.000Z	AVGHelp	gordonjcp	that is wrong there are
2009-05-18T00:13:00.000Z	gordonjcp	AVGHelp	no, there aren't
