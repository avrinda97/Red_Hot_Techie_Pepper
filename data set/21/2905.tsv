2010-09-13T10:52:00.000Z	biesbjerg		Hi guys, when booting my system I suddenly get this error about my filesystem: "mountall: Filesystem has errors: /" and I should run fsck manually
2010-09-13T10:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	biesbjerg	Can you boot a liveCD and run fsck from there?
2010-09-13T10:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	biesbjerg	You don't want to fsck "/" from the LiveCD, you want to find what device is your installed system's root partition and fsck that.
2010-09-13T10:58:00.000Z	biesbjerg	Jordan_U	Okay, fdisk -l tells me sda1 2 and 5
2010-09-13T10:59:00.000Z	biesbjerg	Jordan_U	sda1 is clean, sda2 is zero length and sda5 says something about a "superblock could not be read or does not describe a correct ext2 filesystem"
2010-09-13T11:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	biesbjerg	Can you pastebin the output of "sudo blkid" ?
2010-09-13T11:01:00.000Z	biesbjerg	Jordan_U	Just a sec

2010-09-13T11:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	biesbjerg	Ahh, I assume that your root fs is on top of LVM?
2010-09-13T11:03:00.000Z	biesbjerg	Jordan_U	Am not sure what that means?
2010-09-13T11:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	biesbjerg	Did you install this system yourself?
2010-09-13T11:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	biesbjerg	Did you use the Desktop installer or the alternate installer?
2010-09-13T11:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	biesbjerg	Ok, when you installed you chose to have your root filesystem on LVM (Logical Volume Management). In short it's sort of a way to have more flexable pseudo partititions that you can resize and move around much more easily.
2010-09-13T11:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	biesbjerg	But to access the LVM "volume" containing your root filesystem you'll need to install lvm and set a few things up.
2010-09-13T11:08:00.000Z	biesbjerg	Jordan_U	Sounds weird as this happened after the host system crashed (As I mentioned, the ubuntu is running as a virtual machine)
2010-09-13T11:11:00.000Z	biesbjerg	Jordan_U	Is it hard to fix? I have a backup of the VM, but it means I will lose data (Using ubuntu for dev webserver)
2010-09-13T11:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	biesbjerg	Follow this guide, but run "sudo fsck -y /dev/Volgroup/..." instead of mount. http://linuxwave.blogspot.com/2007/11/mounting-lvm-disk-using-ubuntu-livecd.html
2010-09-13T11:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	biesbjerg	I need to leave for a few minutes but I'll be back.
2010-09-13T11:13:00.000Z	biesbjerg	Jordan_U	Thanks, I'll have a look at the link
2010-09-13T11:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	biesbjerg	You're welcome.
2010-09-13T11:18:00.000Z	biesbjerg	Jordan_U	Sir, you are my hero! Thank you so much!
