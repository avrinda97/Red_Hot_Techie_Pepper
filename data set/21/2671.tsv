2009-07-31T19:47:00.000Z	tyler_johnston		i have a question if anyone can answer, i ran an apt-get update last night on my ubuntu server and now its rejecting all incoming requests
2009-07-31T19:49:00.000Z	nanotube	tyler_johnston	hm, well, could be anything... is it at least responding to ping?
2009-07-31T19:50:00.000Z	tyler_johnston		naontube: it can send out pings, but not respond, nmap says that ssh and http are open
2009-07-31T19:50:00.000Z	tyler_johnston	nanotube	i had a friend reccomend runing tcpdump and nothing looked wrong, then http started working in and out
2009-07-31T19:50:00.000Z	tyler_johnston		ssh wont work still
2009-07-31T19:51:00.000Z	nanotube	tyler_johnston	hm, weird... could it be in need of a reboot?
2009-07-31T19:51:00.000Z	tyler_johnston	nanotube	already did that this morning
2009-07-31T19:52:00.000Z	tyler_johnston	nanotube	any other ideas? D:
2009-07-31T19:53:00.000Z	nanotube	tyler_johnston	ehrm... not really... if you have physical access, maybe try logging in from a console?
2009-07-31T19:53:00.000Z	tyler_johnston	nanotube	i do have console access, everything goes out but nothing is coming in other than http, my iptables are empty and UFW is disabled
2009-07-31T19:54:00.000Z	nanotube	tyler_johnston	and what exactly happens when you try to ssh in?
2009-07-31T19:54:00.000Z	tyler_johnston	nanotube	my connection times out
2009-07-31T19:54:00.000Z	tyler_johnston	nanotube	i'm using putty from a win7 machine
2009-07-31T19:55:00.000Z	nanotube	tyler_johnston	hrm... maybe some unusual putty setting? if you want you can /msg me an ip and i'll try from "real" ssh :)
2009-07-31T19:56:00.000Z	tyler_johnston	nanotube	its an internal webserver, not public facing
2009-07-31T19:56:00.000Z	tyler_johnston		is there an way to rollback an apt-get upgrade?
2009-07-31T19:57:00.000Z	nanotube	tyler_johnston	hm ok. well, i'm out of ideas then... is there anything on the network between you and the server (ie, possibly some kind of firewall? )
2009-07-31T19:57:00.000Z	tyler_johnston	nanotube	no
2009-07-31T19:57:00.000Z	tyler_johnston	nanotube	this only started happening after i ran an apt-get upgrade
2009-07-31T19:58:00.000Z	tyler_johnston		is there a logfile that apt creates?
2009-07-31T19:58:00.000Z	nanotube	tyler_johnston	hrm, i don't know of an easy way to roll back - but you can manually install the older versions for each individual package that was upgraded... btw, was one of the upgrades a kernel, by any chance?
