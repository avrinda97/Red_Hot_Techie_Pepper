2006-10-13T07:36:00.000Z	kmaynard	protos	you can use this to see your ubuntu files so you dont have to reeboot quite as much  http://www.fs-driver.org/
2006-10-13T07:37:00.000Z	kmaynard	protos	are you connecting directly to a modem?
2006-10-13T07:41:00.000Z	kmaynard	protos	you'd have to be in linux
