2010-02-14T01:25:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	histo	two options for you: iTunes has silver in Wine's DB now, OR use VirtualBox (w/USB support) to create a MS VM (if you have a legal copy)
2010-02-14T01:26:00.000Z	histo	ZykoticK9	yeah the wifes laptop is windows box so I just use that untill untethered jailbreak comes out.
2010-02-15T06:57:00.000Z	histo	ZykoticK9	no my answer was appropriate
2010-02-15T06:57:00.000Z	histo	ZykoticK9	he was off topic and told him to search google for the card.
2010-02-15T06:58:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	histo	i agree his question was OT but don't tell people to google it's rather rude
2010-02-15T06:58:00.000Z	histo	ZykoticK9	if you want to answer where he can get a cheap ssd in here thats fine.
2010-02-15T06:58:00.000Z	histo	ZykoticK9	I gave him my opinion
2010-02-15T06:59:00.000Z	histo	ZykoticK9	and answered his question
2010-02-15T06:59:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	histo	i would have been fine with you (doing what you just did) and sending him the !ot - but <person google> is not acceptable behaviour in this channel
2010-03-03T07:11:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	histo	assuming you have AMD, then yes - svm = virtualization in CPU.  In order to enable it in VBox, open the properties of your VM -- System / Acceleration tab and be sure Enable VT-x/AMD-V has a checkmark
2010-03-03T07:14:00.000Z	histo	ZykoticK9	what does that due then devote a core to the virtual machine?
2010-03-03T07:15:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	histo	mainly having CPU Virtualization speeds things up, as well as allows OS that wouldn't load to load
2010-03-03T07:16:00.000Z	histo	ZykoticK9	cool can't wait to try it out.
2010-03-15T01:23:00.000Z	histo	ZykoticK9	youtube works in lucid
2010-03-15T01:24:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	histo	of course
2010-03-31T06:17:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	histo	believe it or not - Dapper is still supported on server
2010-04-10T06:20:00.000Z	histo	ZykoticK9	^^^^ he may not need pae but default server isntall installs it.
2010-04-11T00:32:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	histo	that was my suggestion - which was shot down
2010-04-11T00:35:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	histo	+1 forgot about that
2010-04-11T00:44:00.000Z	histo	ZykoticK9	maybe somthing in his .bashrc?
2010-04-11T00:45:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	histo	perhaps?  I really don't know.
