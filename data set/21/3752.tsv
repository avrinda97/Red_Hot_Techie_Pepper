2008-09-30T18:21:00.000Z	zetheroo-ubuntu		how can I get kopete to stop hogging my sound in Ubuntu?
2008-09-30T18:21:00.000Z	jim_p	zetheroo-ubuntu	disable all audible notifications from kde's contol panel
2008-09-30T18:22:00.000Z	zetheroo-ubuntu	jim_p	 : I am using Ubuntu though... where is the kde control panel?
2008-09-30T18:23:00.000Z	jim_p	zetheroo-ubuntu	open up a terminal and type kontrol or something similar
2008-09-30T18:23:00.000Z	zetheroo-ubuntu	jim_p	 : would I still have the sound notifications in kopete after that?
2008-09-30T18:24:00.000Z	jim_p	zetheroo-ubuntu	no. isnt this what you want to disable?
2008-09-30T18:24:00.000Z	zetheroo-ubuntu	jim_p	 : no ... I want/need the sounds .. just want to be able to play music at the same time as I chat
2008-09-30T18:25:00.000Z	jim_p	zetheroo-ubuntu	when a sound is played, music stops?
2008-09-30T18:25:00.000Z	zetheroo-ubuntu	jim_p	 : either kopete has sound and nothing else ... or everything has sound and not kopete
2008-09-30T18:27:00.000Z	jim_p	zetheroo-ubuntu	then tell (through) kopete to use the !@#$%^ arts subsystem that kde provides and leave alsa for the other players

2008-09-30T18:29:00.000Z	zetheroo-ubuntu	jim_p	: how do you get the kde control panel in ubuntu?
2008-09-30T18:29:00.000Z	jim_p	zetheroo-ubuntu	if you type kontrol at the terminal it will appear
