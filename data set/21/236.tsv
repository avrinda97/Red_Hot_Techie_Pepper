2012-11-11T11:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	shuhaib	Presumably "4K"?

2012-11-11T11:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	shuhaib	You haven't answered my question. Is that because you didn't understand it or because you didn't see it?
2012-11-11T11:43:00.000Z	shuhaib	Jordan_U	  it does the phone support a USB Mass Storage device mode ..
2012-11-11T11:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	shuhaib	Please connect the phone in USBMS mode and pastebin the output of "sudo blkid".
2012-11-11T11:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	shuhaib	Are you booted into Ubuntu currently?
2012-11-11T11:47:00.000Z	shuhaib	Jordan_U	next step please
2012-11-11T11:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	shuhaib	Do you know how to run commands in the terminal?
2012-11-11T11:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	shuhaib	Run "sudo blkid", then copy and paste the output to http://pastebin.ubuntu.com and give us a link to the pastebin that creates.
