2009-12-25T09:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	terrorink	 thats because gdm is restarting.. it DID  kill X. and gdm respanws it like its set up to.
2009-12-25T09:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	terrorink	 if you want no X going.. stop the gdm service
2009-12-25T09:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	terrorink	 stop the gdm service...
2009-12-25T09:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	terrorink	 then bind the command to stop gdm to some key combo,.
2009-12-25T09:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	terrorink	 this is linux.. of course you can do that. :)
2009-12-25T09:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	terrorink	 read up on the 'sudoers' file. and set it where the user dosent need the pass for that command. is one way
2009-12-25T09:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	terrorink	 start with 'man sudoers' and read up on sudoers configuration.
2009-12-25T09:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	terrorink	 and thers no need to msg me..
2009-12-27T07:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	terrorink	 try http://goosh.org/
2009-12-27T07:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	terrorink	 it works.
2009-12-27T07:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	terrorink	 i imagine it depends on what you are doing with it. ive not heard many complaints.
2009-12-27T07:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	terrorink	 its not like its causing peoples pc's to explode and stuff.. thats win7
