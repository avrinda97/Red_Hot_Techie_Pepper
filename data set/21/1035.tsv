2011-02-27T14:08:00.000Z	javahorn_		Hi, i am on LIVE CD ubuntu 10.10. Can i find skype and test it firsthand for video etc , before installing actual ubuntu?
2011-02-27T14:09:00.000Z	Fudge	javahorn_	 sure look in synaptic for skype
2011-02-27T14:09:00.000Z	javahorn_	Fudge	 sorry very new
2011-02-27T14:09:00.000Z	javahorn_	Fudge	 where to find synaptic
2011-02-27T14:13:00.000Z	javahorn_	Fudge	it is not at software centre, i mean , does skype along with LIVE CD , so that i can test, rather than installing afresh?
2011-02-27T14:14:00.000Z	Fudge	javahorn_	  see my second solution, quick  check sudo apt-cache search skype if it shows sudo apt-get isntall skype
2011-02-27T14:18:00.000Z	javahorn_	Fudge	sudo apt-cache search skype at command prompt does not throw up anything, so it is confirmed LIVE CD does not have skype preinstalled. now best will be to install as you suggested?
2011-02-27T14:18:00.000Z	Fudge	javahorn_	 in the default places it gets programs from, called the repositories
2011-02-27T14:21:00.000Z	javahorn_	Fudge	 video works fine with that kind of .deb?
2011-02-27T14:21:00.000Z	javahorn_	Fudge	 Thanks, let me try, be here. ;-)
2011-02-27T14:28:00.000Z	javahorn_	Fudge	while installing 10.10. i get "No Root File System defined". what to correct?
2011-02-27T14:31:00.000Z	Fudge	javahorn_	 when tryint to install the root filesystem goes in / so the mount  point will be /
2011-02-27T14:34:00.000Z	Fudge	javahorn_	 did you put / in as the mount point
2011-02-27T14:35:00.000Z	Fudge	javahorn_	 that fix you up?
2011-02-27T14:35:00.000Z	javahorn_	Fudge	NO
2011-02-27T14:36:00.000Z	javahorn_	Fudge	 so i am not sure, where i can enter this / as mount point
2011-02-27T14:36:00.000Z	Fudge	javahorn_	 you cant install to a drive tha tis mounted or you ahve viewed from your cd, right click and unmount it
2011-02-27T14:38:00.000Z	javahorn_	Fudge	 :(
2011-02-27T14:44:00.000Z	javahorn_	Fudge	what is optimum drive space to allocate?
2011-02-27T14:45:00.000Z	Fudge	javahorn_	 it depends on your drive, 20gig from
2011-02-27T15:31:00.000Z	javahorn_	Fudge	how long it should take to install, i am stuck at keyboard layout for almost 1 hr!!!!
