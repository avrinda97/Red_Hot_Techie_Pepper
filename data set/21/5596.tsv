2008-04-26T09:06:00.000Z	jamiejackson		 latest ubuntu loads some modules out of order, so i want to re-order them with a script that runs at boot time. the script will unload and reload the modules that were previously loaded out of order. can you help me figure out where these linesshould go? (new script, existing script, etc.?). i'm going to be telling many others where to put this script, so i wanna get it right
2008-04-26T09:07:00.000Z	neil_d	jamiejackson	is there an '/etc/rc.local' file
2008-04-26T09:09:00.000Z	neil_d	jamiejackson	it is on gutsy, I would create a file in /etc/init.d and a link to it in /etc/rc?.d
2008-04-26T09:09:00.000Z	jamiejackson	neil_d	it's hardy, does that make a difference?
2008-04-26T09:10:00.000Z	neil_d	jamiejackson	I am waiting till tonight to do the upgrade, but I wouldn't think so.
2008-04-26T09:11:00.000Z	jamiejackson	neil_d	which rc?.d ? i don't know much about these scripts
2008-04-26T09:11:00.000Z	neil_d	jamiejackson	ok more detail.
2008-04-26T09:13:00.000Z	jamiejackson	neil_d	"more detail" meaning you need more from me, or you're about to provide more detail? :)
2008-04-26T09:13:00.000Z	neil_d	jamiejackson	I am looking for some data hang on a minute.
2008-04-26T09:16:00.000Z	neil_d	jamiejackson	I am looking for a file, I forgotten the name.
2008-04-26T09:20:00.000Z	neil_d	jamiejackson	have you the file '/etc/inittab' ?
2008-04-26T09:21:00.000Z	jamiejackson	neil_d	no file of that name
2008-04-26T09:22:00.000Z	neil_d	jamiejackson	ok, I don't know what to do from here.  have you a '/etc/init.d' directory
2008-04-26T09:24:00.000Z	neil_d	jamiejackson	ok, I am feeling my way here.  cd to it, and have a look at the file names, these are the scripts that start different things at init time.
2008-04-26T09:25:00.000Z	jamiejackson	neil_d	someone told me these were for services (implying services *only*), is that not true?
2008-04-26T09:28:00.000Z	neil_d	jamiejackson	I suppose it depends on the exact definition of 'service', these scripts get run to start different things at init time.
2008-04-26T09:28:00.000Z	jamiejackson	neil_d	if i add a script in there and make it executable, will just doing those two steps make it run at init time?
2008-04-26T09:28:00.000Z	neil_d	jamiejackson	Is there a rc.local there
2008-04-26T09:29:00.000Z	jamiejackson	neil_d	yes
2008-04-26T09:30:00.000Z	neil_d	jamiejackson	I would sugjest you put your command in that rc.local file, maybe just something that wont cause trouble to start with.  like load a module you don't need as a test.
2008-04-26T09:32:00.000Z	neil_d	jamiejackson	bye
