2006-06-11T05:01:00.000Z	Warbo	rixth	Ha. Sounds like a good marketing plan, show you your stuff but make you pay to get it back
2006-08-03T09:36:00.000Z	Warbo	rixth	At least you don't have to maually drag XMs into the playlist, then get "This is not part of your collection" in Banshee :)
2006-08-03T09:37:00.000Z	rixth	Warbo	Banshee made my system so unstable when importing my 10,000+ library, where as Rhythmbox was cool with it. I'd  like ipod write support though
2006-08-03T09:38:00.000Z	Warbo	rixth	I didn't notice your correction. I don't like Rhytmbox for some reason. Listen is good
2006-08-03T09:39:00.000Z	Warbo	rixth	Listen does too, it automatically creates a short playlist based on it (and it works well, selecting similar artists. Only problem is it doesn't have much of a memory, so it can cycle through the same songs a bit)
2006-08-03T09:42:00.000Z	rixth	Warbo	can't find anything about listen?
2006-08-03T09:43:00.000Z	Warbo	rixth	listengnome.free.fr I think
2006-08-03T09:44:00.000Z	rixth	Warbo	how does Listen sort? does "The Rolling Stones" get sorted under R and not T?
2006-08-03T09:49:00.000Z	rixth	Warbo	ipod support?! last.fm support (not just submitting)? wikipedia viewing? Brilliant!
2006-08-03T10:05:00.000Z	rixth	Warbo	Listen is AMAZING. Pretty UI, lyrics, Wikipedia... ahh
2006-08-03T10:05:00.000Z	rixth	Warbo	much more resource friendly that RB too
2006-08-03T10:06:00.000Z	Warbo	rixth	I added the repo to this LiveCD session especially :)
2006-08-03T10:07:00.000Z	rixth	Warbo	my only gripe is that artists starting with The get sorted under T and not the main artist name (iTunes, Windows Media etc do this)
2006-08-03T10:07:00.000Z	Warbo	rixth	I set my tags to "Artist, The"
2006-08-03T10:13:00.000Z	rixth	Warbo	does listen touch the tags of a file though?
2006-08-03T10:13:00.000Z	Warbo	rixth	I think so
2006-08-03T10:13:00.000Z	rixth	Warbo	argh!
2006-08-03T10:13:00.000Z	Warbo	rixth	What? I HATE it when I spend ages retaggin files in Amarok, then they are wrong in other players!
2006-08-03T10:14:00.000Z	rixth	Warbo	all my tags are pristine, my file structure is the same everywhere... I really don't want someting messing with it eh.
2006-08-03T10:15:00.000Z	Warbo	rixth	My filesystem used to have a nice stucture, but I couldn't be bothered to stick to it
