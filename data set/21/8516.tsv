2007-10-24T04:45:00.000Z	DogWater		Yes and Fedora 7 is not to be used for production machines..
2007-10-24T04:46:00.000Z	DogWater		are you serious?
2007-10-24T04:47:00.000Z	DogWater		You know everything!
2007-10-24T04:47:00.000Z	DogWater		:D
2007-10-24T04:48:00.000Z	DogWater		VMWare is nice because you dont have to manage it on server, the last time i used Xen (et, al) you had to manage everything on the host node
2007-10-24T04:48:00.000Z	DogWater		but i guess that only matters to folks who are running lots of boxen
2007-10-24T04:49:00.000Z	DogWater		Yeah, I know he could've been a little more condescending
2007-10-24T04:49:00.000Z	DogWater		oh wait, maybe not
2007-10-24T04:50:00.000Z	DogWater		anyway, unless anyone knows how to reset the 'appearances' preferences screen back to defaults in compiz, im out of here ;-)
2007-10-24T04:51:00.000Z	DogWater		To be honest, and not to polish any apples, both of my nvidia cards worked great with the restricted drivers right off the bat
2007-10-24T04:52:00.000Z	mneptok	DogWater	the Fonts tab in the Appearance prefpanel doesn't reset your fonts?
2007-10-24T04:52:00.000Z	DogWater	mneptok	oh i just didnt know if there was a way to just reset it...
2007-10-24T04:52:00.000Z	DogWater	mneptok	all of it.
2007-10-24T04:53:00.000Z	mneptok	DogWater	you'd have to selectively delete GNOME settings files
2007-10-24T04:54:00.000Z	DogWater	mneptok	ewws. alrighty i suppose i'll just mess with it until i get it the way i want, or if it annoys me enough i'll reformat
2007-10-24T04:54:00.000Z	DogWater	mneptok	would be rather rad if they had a 'defaults' button though
2007-10-24T04:54:00.000Z	mneptok	DogWater	and, if you care, htop > top
2007-10-24T04:55:00.000Z	DogWater	mneptok	im old, let me die in peace
2007-10-24T04:55:00.000Z	mneptok	DogWater	i'm prolly order than you :)
2007-10-24T04:56:00.000Z	mneptok	DogWater	the problem with "restore to defaults" is that every distro, and vanilla GNOME itself, will have a different opinion of what that is.
2007-10-24T04:56:00.000Z	mneptok	DogWater	i'm 42.
