2009-07-25T14:09:00.000Z	anish		i GOT A REALLY BIG problem
2009-07-25T14:09:00.000Z	anish		I changed my Windows Partition to Linux Swap and cant change it back to NTFS
2009-07-25T14:09:00.000Z	anish		I tried GParted
2009-07-25T14:10:00.000Z	anish		But it doesn't show NTFS in the "Format to" options
2009-07-25T14:10:00.000Z	anish		And if I format, it'll be gone...
2009-07-25T14:10:00.000Z	anish		Its not in use and I dont know if I have permission to acess it
2009-07-25T14:10:00.000Z	anish		Im on sudo in Xubuntu right now
2009-07-25T14:10:00.000Z	anish		Im dual booting it
2009-07-25T14:11:00.000Z	anish		I tried to get my Flash Drive to become a Linux Swap and instead turned my Windows Partition into a Linux swap
2009-07-25T14:11:00.000Z	anish		There's your answer MusicGuy
2009-07-25T14:12:00.000Z	Gnea	anish	forget gparted, open a terminal and use fdisk
2009-07-25T14:12:00.000Z	anish	Gnea	isk what?
2009-07-25T14:12:00.000Z	anish	Gnea	fdisk what?
2009-07-25T14:12:00.000Z	Gnea	anish	on the hard drive
2009-07-25T14:14:00.000Z	anish	Gnea	I tired fdisk /dev/sda1 and it says unable to open
2009-07-25T14:14:00.000Z	Gnea	anish	right, sda1 is a partition, sda is the hard disk itself
2009-07-25T14:15:00.000Z	Gnea	anish	from there you can change the partition TYPE back to 7
2009-07-25T14:16:00.000Z	Gnea	anish	sudo fdisk /dev/sda
2009-07-25T14:16:00.000Z	Gnea	anish	read the help from within, follow it.
2009-07-25T14:17:00.000Z	Gnea	anish	irrelevent.
2009-07-25T14:18:00.000Z	Gnea	anish	look for the option to show the partitions, then find the option to change the partition type for the partition you need to change it on
