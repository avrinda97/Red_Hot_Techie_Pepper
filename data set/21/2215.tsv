2009-12-10T11:34:00.000Z	Delta__		Does ALSA utilize alot of CPU cycles for anyone else here?
2009-12-10T11:34:00.000Z	vimpulse	Delta__	 what is the problem?  Make sure to prefix "vimpulse: " first, as I am not watching my screen.
2009-12-10T11:36:00.000Z	Delta__	vimpulse	I'm programming with libao, and it looks like, since I removed PulseAudio from my system that it's costing more for Audio Output
2009-12-10T11:36:00.000Z	vimpulse	Delta__	 is your computer too slow to use now?
2009-12-10T11:37:00.000Z	Delta__	vimpulse	no, but it's not very nice for the audio driver to use 7-10% of the CPU
2009-12-10T11:37:00.000Z	vimpulse	Delta__	 but if you have CPU cycles to spare, then why do you care?  :)
2009-12-10T11:38:00.000Z	Delta__	vimpulse	because I'm trying to make this program as invisible on the system resources as possible
2009-12-10T11:38:00.000Z	vimpulse	Delta__	 why?
2009-12-10T11:38:00.000Z	Delta__	vimpulse	because I run Folding@Home
2009-12-10T11:39:00.000Z	Delta__	vimpulse	and because I like playing games, and not being lagged down by the audio driver
2009-12-10T11:39:00.000Z	vimpulse	Delta__	 it is still not worth it to spend your time just to speed up Folding@Home.  If the games go at too slow an FPS, then come back and ask us for help again.  :)
2009-12-10T11:39:00.000Z	Delta__	vimpulse	I just find it odd that the audio driver would be using that much anyways
2009-12-10T11:40:00.000Z	Delta__	vimpulse	is there an IRC channel for ALSA?
2009-12-10T11:40:00.000Z	vimpulse	Delta__	 we are always low on supporter time, and so to diagnose that would not be an ideal use of our time.  I don't know.  /msg alis list *alsa*
2009-12-10T11:40:00.000Z	Delta__	vimpulse	because this bugs be greatly
2009-12-10T11:41:00.000Z	Delta__	vimpulse	Thanks for your time
2009-12-10T11:41:00.000Z	vimpulse	Delta__	 you are welcome.  I suggest, again, that you not spend the Alsa channel's time either.
2009-12-10T11:43:00.000Z	Delta__	vimpulse	I see this as a major flaw in the system, unless the audio driver is supposed to eat cpu like this
2009-12-10T11:44:00.000Z	vimpulse	Delta__	 I think you shouldn't worry unless you are low on CPU.  Maybe it's because of something *you* are doing with libao.  Supporters' time is valuable, and unless your games are running at low FPS, you are spending other people's (supporters') time I think unnecessarily.
2009-12-10T11:46:00.000Z	Delta__	vimpulse	I value CPU time, I would hope the Ubuntu devs think the same
2009-12-10T11:47:00.000Z	vimpulse	Delta__	 human time is more valuable than CPU time.  And again, your problem is probably only on your PC, not on all Alsa users' PCs.
