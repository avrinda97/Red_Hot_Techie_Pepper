2009-03-11T11:58:00.000Z	Rodrigo_Lopes		Hi Titan.. lets talk any words.....
2009-03-11T11:58:00.000Z	Titan8990	Rodrigo_Lopes	sorry?
2009-03-11T11:58:00.000Z	Rodrigo_Lopes	Titan8990	.. kde sucks. its same windows
2009-03-11T11:59:00.000Z	Rodrigo_Lopes	Titan8990	 gnome like windows to....
2009-03-11T11:59:00.000Z	Titan8990	Rodrigo_Lopes	agreed, but gnome is better
2009-03-11T12:00:00.000Z	Rodrigo_Lopes	Titan8990	 you need to try xfce and fluxbox.. ist a more unix like windows manager
2009-03-11T12:00:00.000Z	Titan8990	Rodrigo_Lopes	I use xfce on my laptops
2009-03-11T12:00:00.000Z	Titan8990	Rodrigo_Lopes	gnome on my desktop
2009-03-11T12:00:00.000Z	Rodrigo_Lopes	Titan8990	 congragualtions...xfce.. dont steal ram in your system...
2009-03-11T12:01:00.000Z	Titan8990	Rodrigo_Lopes	RAM is dirt cheap.... I use what I like
2009-03-11T12:02:00.000Z	Titan8990	Rodrigo_Lopes	I do all my administration from the terminal, I'm willing to give up 1/4 of my RAM to some eyecandy for daily use
2009-03-11T12:03:00.000Z	Titan8990	Rodrigo_Lopes	I use gentoo, and CPU is my primary limitation on all my machines (compiling)
2009-03-11T12:04:00.000Z	Rodrigo_Lopes	Titan8990	.. its.. good.. in terminal is better.. faster.. and more configurable...
2009-03-11T12:04:00.000Z	Titan8990	Rodrigo_Lopes	don't really understand it... on my desktop with gnome and 2gb of RAM, I can open what seems like a unlimited ammt of applications and my ram usage never exceeds 500-650mb
2009-03-11T12:04:00.000Z	Titan8990	Rodrigo_Lopes	agreed, also, in gentoo you don't get a choice
2009-03-11T12:04:00.000Z	Titan8990	Rodrigo_Lopes	if I do use a GUI, its a web interface like phpmyadmin for mysql
2009-03-11T12:07:00.000Z	Rodrigo_Lopes	Titan8990	yes.. .. you have much ram. ...I have 1gb.. ..... I think.. .. ubuntu, gnome, kde.. ...put persons longer of the true linux usage....
2009-03-11T12:08:00.000Z	Titan8990	Rodrigo_Lopes	"true linux usage" is what you want it to be.... choice and flexibility are what make it great
2009-03-11T12:09:00.000Z	Titan8990	Rodrigo_Lopes	I don't like kde because of your point about it being like windows, but some like it for that reason and have that choice, thus making linux great for its choices
2009-03-11T12:11:00.000Z	Rodrigo_Lopes	Titan8990	.. I dont now... but its a many "flamewars" in net about windows, gnome, and kde.. interface...... and I think kde4 copy any windows interface.....
2009-03-11T12:12:00.000Z	Rodrigo_Lopes	Titan8990	 because this I think fluxbox, xfce.. and anothers "simple" interface is better....
