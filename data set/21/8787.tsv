2007-06-30T11:48:00.000Z	dfgas_		i am using compiz fusion it LOVIN IT
2007-06-30T11:49:00.000Z	Wyzard	dfgas_	that's not real transparency, that's just taking a screenshot of the wallpaper and tinting it
2007-06-30T11:50:00.000Z	dfgas_	Wyzard	yah i know, but its still the thought
2007-06-30T11:51:00.000Z	dfgas_	Wyzard	you see or try compiz fusion yet?
2007-06-30T11:51:00.000Z	Wyzard	dfgas_	nope, until it's packaged I'm not too interested
2007-06-30T11:51:00.000Z	dfgas_	Wyzard	you add a repo and you can install it through apt
2007-06-30T11:52:00.000Z	dfgas_	Wyzard	you want the how to one it?
2007-06-30T11:52:00.000Z	Wyzard	dfgas_	That's good to know, but I'm primarily a Debian user so I'll wait for Debian packages (unless the site has them already)
2007-06-30T11:53:00.000Z	Wyzard	dfgas_	and last time I tried Compiz it didn't integrate with GNOME quite as nicely as Metacity
2007-06-30T11:53:00.000Z	dfgas_	Wyzard	heh, not sure then
2007-06-30T11:53:00.000Z	dfgas_	Wyzard	i am using compiz fusion at the moment and it runs awsome, movies in woble windows reflectios, movies in the cube and even gl games play right too
2007-06-30T11:54:00.000Z	Wyzard	dfgas_	If it's a new computer, maybe it's defective?
2007-06-30T11:54:00.000Z	Wyzard	dfgas_	oops
2007-06-30T11:55:00.000Z	Wyzard	dfgas_	Visual effects like that are nice, but GNOME integration is more important IMO
2007-06-30T11:56:00.000Z	Wyzard	dfgas_	My main interest in a composited window manager is for the sake of dragging windows around more smoothly
2007-06-30T11:56:00.000Z	dfgas_	Wyzard	it seems smoothe to me, i am not sure what you mean by it not integrating so well
2007-06-30T11:57:00.000Z	Wyzard	dfgas_	IIRC, under Compiz the GNOME pager (the little applet that shows thumbnails of your virtual desktops) didn't work quite the same
2007-06-30T11:58:00.000Z	Wyzard	dfgas_	That's the sort of thing I mean
2007-06-30T12:02:00.000Z	Wyzard	dfgas_	ndiswrapper loads Windows drivers, so I wouldn't expect it to work on 64-bit Linux, unless maybe there's a 64-bit Windows driver for your card
2007-06-30T12:02:00.000Z	dfgas_	Wyzard	hmmm, never really thought of that i guess :(
2007-06-30T12:03:00.000Z	dfgas_	Wyzard	however i don't see a difference from 64 to 32 so i am just going to stay at 32
