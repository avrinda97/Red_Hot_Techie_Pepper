2009-08-25T19:46:00.000Z	simran		guys if i delete my recovery partition using gparted, would grub automatically deleted it from boot selection
2009-08-25T19:47:00.000Z	edbian	simran	It would if you run "update-grub" which would rescan the drives for all kernels (among other things)
2009-08-25T19:48:00.000Z	edbian	simran	You can simply edit /boot/grub/menu.lst and remove that boot option
2009-08-25T19:49:00.000Z	simran	edbian	but that wnt stop it loading into ubuntu...in the file explorer
2009-08-25T19:49:00.000Z	edbian	simran	that's /etc/fstab.  Do you have any need for this "recovery" partition?  Or is it windows recover
2009-08-25T19:50:00.000Z	edbian	simran	You can make an entry for it that basically says "ignore this partition"
2009-08-25T19:50:00.000Z	simran	edbian	how?
2009-08-25T19:50:00.000Z	edbian	simran	Well first answer my other question.  Do you have any need for this partition?
2009-08-25T19:51:00.000Z	edbian	simran	Than just delete it.  It is pointless to edit 2 or 3 config files simply to hide a partition when you could just delete said partition.
2009-08-25T19:52:00.000Z	simran	edbian	 ok thanks
2009-08-25T19:52:00.000Z	edbian	simran	NP! :)
2009-08-25T19:52:00.000Z	simran	edbian	ill just use gparted within ubuntu
2009-08-25T19:52:00.000Z	edbian	simran	gparted rocks.  Just make sure you don't try to edit a partition you're mounted on.  If you need to edit ubuntu's root or something just use a live CD
2009-08-25T19:54:00.000Z	simran	edbian	the recovery drive is present in ubuntu, but isnt mounted
2009-08-25T19:54:00.000Z	edbian	simran	It is safe :)
2009-08-25T19:54:00.000Z	edbian	simran	gparted won't let you edit partitions you're mounted on anyway I think
2009-08-25T19:55:00.000Z	simran	edbian	i have the same problem on my asus eee, but i would like to keep tht partition...how can i hide it from ubunut
2009-08-25T19:56:00.000Z	edbian	simran	You want it to not show up in nautilus or your want it to not show up in grub?
2009-08-25T19:57:00.000Z	simran	edbian	not to show in nautilus
2009-08-25T19:58:00.000Z	edbian	simran	make an entry for it in /etc/fstab   https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fstab
2009-08-25T19:58:00.000Z	edbian	simran	and for the mount point put "none" just like swap
