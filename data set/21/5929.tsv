2007-10-21T04:14:00.000Z	schecky4		Ok, does anyone else agree the the Radeon 200M is the WORST graphics card ever?
2007-10-21T04:14:00.000Z	schecky4		So many problems installing gutsy...
2007-10-21T04:14:00.000Z	jdong	schecky4	the drivers suck a bit currently, but overall I don't think it's that bad of a card
2007-10-21T04:14:00.000Z	jdong	schecky4	it's about the only integrated card that I know with adequate performance to play modern games
2007-10-21T04:15:00.000Z	jdong	schecky4	the driver situation should dramatically imporve with the next release of fglrx....
2007-10-21T04:16:00.000Z	schecky4	jdong	do you have an idea when  fglrx will be updated?
2007-10-21T04:16:00.000Z	jdong	schecky4	lots of speculation, most likely by the end of the month.
2007-10-21T04:16:00.000Z	schecky4	jdong	oh, thats not terrible.  thanks
2007-10-21T04:17:00.000Z	jdong	schecky4	sure thing. Michael (the guy who runs Phoronix, beta-tester for ATI/AMD too) has implied quite some good words about the driver, and that it's on track for timely release
2007-10-21T04:17:00.000Z	jdong	schecky4	as an owner of a mobility x1400, I can't wait.
2007-10-21T04:19:00.000Z	schecky4	jdong	 hah.  i just want to be able to adjust my screen brightness without rebooting
2007-10-21T04:19:00.000Z	jdong	schecky4	eep, that's rough.... my BIOS controls brightness for me via hardware-bound keys. fortunately.
2007-10-21T04:20:00.000Z	schecky4	jdong	lucky. mine has to go through ATI catalyst control and of course its not supported by the driver yet.
2007-10-21T04:20:00.000Z	schecky4	jdong	oh well. as long as i can still see the display, i'm relatively happy
2007-10-21T04:20:00.000Z	jdong	schecky4	that sucks. Hope 8.42 solves that for you. I just want answers to why 3D framerates in Linux are less than 1/2 what they are with the newest Windows drivers....
2007-10-21T04:21:00.000Z	schecky4	jdong	yeah, the driver only fully supports 2D acceleration now
2007-10-21T04:21:00.000Z	schecky4	jdong	3D is "questionable" to say the least
2007-10-21T04:21:00.000Z	jdong	schecky4	3D "works" here, but I never realized how powerful this GPU was until I used XP for a few days a month ago.
2007-10-21T04:22:00.000Z	schecky4	jdong	i dual-boot (so i can still play my MMORPG's) on windows so i'm constantly reminded =/
2007-10-21T04:24:00.000Z	schecky4	jdong	hey, thanks for the info. im going to head out
2007-10-21T04:24:00.000Z	jdong	schecky4	sure thing
