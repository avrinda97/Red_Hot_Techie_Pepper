2006-03-28T13:04:00.000Z	IamEthos		okay
2006-03-28T13:04:00.000Z	IamEthos		so I used GParted to format a hard drive as Fat32
2006-03-28T13:04:00.000Z	IamEthos		but Ubuntu still wants to mount it as ext3
2006-03-28T13:04:00.000Z	IamEthos		how do I fix that?
2006-03-28T13:05:00.000Z	oskude	IamEthos	i think (never used) gparted doesnt format...
2006-03-28T13:06:00.000Z	oskude	IamEthos	if you want format fat32 in a partition do "mkfs.vfat /path/to/your/partition"
2006-03-28T13:10:00.000Z	oskude	IamEthos	post the result of "sudo fdisk -l" to pastebin
2006-03-28T13:14:00.000Z	oskude	IamEthos	i think you have to make it fat32 as partition type first, then format with mkfs.vfat
2006-03-28T13:15:00.000Z	IamEthos	oskude	so first make fat32, then mkfs.vfat?
2006-03-28T13:15:00.000Z	oskude	IamEthos	fat32 = vfat
2006-03-28T13:15:00.000Z	oskude	IamEthos	yes make fat32 in partition program
2006-03-28T13:17:00.000Z	IamEthos	oskude	the path being /dev/sda2 or /media/sda2?
2006-03-28T13:18:00.000Z	oskude	IamEthos	/dev/xxxxx is the "physical" location of the device and /media/xxxx is the path where it is/willbe mounted
2006-03-28T13:19:00.000Z	oskude	IamEthos	btw, when you partition or format the partition must NOT be mounted
2006-03-28T13:21:00.000Z	oskude	IamEthos	"best" is relative...
2006-03-28T13:23:00.000Z	oskude	IamEthos	yes, but dunno about commands on connect
2006-03-28T13:24:00.000Z	oskude	IamEthos	good idea, i would need that too :)
2006-03-28T14:16:00.000Z	oskude	IamEthos	i have linux as "primary" 4years now
2006-03-28T14:17:00.000Z	oskude	IamEthos	if you like vector gracphic, see this http://xaraxtreme.org/ (it can even draw and save allready)
2006-03-28T14:18:00.000Z	oskude	IamEthos	for the normal web usage is gimp more than enough...
2006-03-28T14:20:00.000Z	oskude	IamEthos	gedit is enough for my html/php/bash/python ...
