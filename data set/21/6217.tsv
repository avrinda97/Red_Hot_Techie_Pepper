2007-05-08T06:33:00.000Z	driverz		I'm looking for some help installing Feisty on an external USB drive
2007-05-08T06:34:00.000Z	driverz		Michael1028... are u installing to a USB drive?
2007-05-08T06:34:00.000Z	driverz		What prob are you having?
2007-05-08T06:35:00.000Z	driverz		... and is it Feisty?
2007-05-08T06:37:00.000Z	driverz		I have read that Feisty recognizes all drives as SCSI but I got hd0 for a choice to install GRUB
2007-05-08T06:38:00.000Z	driverz		I think you might want to try the alternate install CD so you can choose where to install GRUB
2007-05-08T06:39:00.000Z	driverz		I've tried changing the GRUB install to sda, sda1, sd0 - all with no luck
2007-05-08T06:40:00.000Z	Pelo	driverz	grub doesn'T recognise  sda sda1 ect,  it works with (hd0,0) ie hdA,B where A is the number of the hdd,  and B the number of the partition,     the numbering starts with 0
2007-05-08T06:41:00.000Z	Pelo	driverz	maybe the installer does the conversion for your
2007-05-08T06:47:00.000Z	Pelo	driverz	it doesn'T see them as hda hdb, it sees them in another naming system altogether,
2007-05-08T06:49:00.000Z	Pelo	driverz	not sure,  how many other hdd ( all type included) do you have on your comp?  the numbering starts with zero so hd0,0 or something
2007-05-08T06:50:00.000Z	driverz	Pelo	I have one IDE internal on the secondary channel
2007-05-08T06:52:00.000Z	Pelo	driverz	and you want to install grub on the usb external, so my best educated guess is that you will be instaling to (hd1,0),   second hdd ( in this case a usb) first partition
2007-05-08T06:53:00.000Z	driverz	Pelo	 Thanks I'll give it a try.... nothing to lose at this point.
2007-05-08T06:54:00.000Z	Pelo	driverz	if youcan open up your comp, consider unplugging your ide driver so there is nothing else to install to ,  but the os on it will not be automaticaly added
2007-05-08T06:55:00.000Z	driverz	Pelo	 The internal has data on it that I want to be accessible. It will be recognized after the install when I reconnect it, yes?
2007-05-08T06:57:00.000Z	driverz	Pelo	 I'll go and see what happens... thanks again
2007-05-08T07:32:00.000Z	Pelo	driverz	that is nasty
2007-05-08T07:32:00.000Z	driverz	Pelo	Weird, no? This is my first experience with an external drive.
2007-05-08T07:33:00.000Z	Pelo	driverz	that is one more then me
