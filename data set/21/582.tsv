2012-01-10T02:45:00.000Z	bean	kasii	it's hard to tell you what to do when we have no idea what could be wrong.
2012-01-10T02:45:00.000Z	bean	kasii	can you do anything, or is it just spinning?
2012-01-10T02:46:00.000Z	kasii	bean	 when i press a shutdown button it load for a long but it wont shutdown
2012-01-10T02:46:00.000Z	bean	kasii	I know, but can you still open a terminal or anything?
2012-01-10T02:47:00.000Z	bean	kasii	then you'll have to look into the logs. I'd suggest looking at the end of /var/log/syslog or typing 'dmesg'
