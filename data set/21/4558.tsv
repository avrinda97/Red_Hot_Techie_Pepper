2008-10-31T19:25:00.000Z	lopin		Okay.  Quick question.  I may have to install Ibex, rather than upgrade, cause I have that nasty ATI driver bug.  I need the Build-essential package to compile my wireless drivers from source.  I need some way to download build-essential, and it's dependencies, for Intrepid.  I've already got APTonCD, so if that can help, then awesome.  Anyone have any ideas?
2008-10-31T19:26:00.000Z	ikonia	lopin	plug a cable in and download
2008-10-31T19:26:00.000Z	lopin	ikonia	Not an option. This laptop only has Wireless Connectivity, and is going to be doing internet sharing for every other computer I have access to.
2008-10-31T19:27:00.000Z	ikonia	lopin	your using a wirles only laptop as a device for internet sharing
2008-10-31T19:27:00.000Z	ikonia	lopin	what model laptop is it
2008-10-31T19:28:00.000Z	lopin	ikonia	Acer Aspire 5050.  I have to use the new Madwifi HAL to get the wireless working, henceforth why I have to build it from source.
2008-10-31T19:29:00.000Z	ikonia	lopin	how are you on the internet now ?
2008-10-31T19:29:00.000Z	lopin	ikonia	I'm on Hardy.  I've already built the drivers for this kernel.
2008-10-31T19:29:00.000Z	ikonia	lopin	how did you do that for hardy ?
2008-10-31T19:29:00.000Z	lopin	ikonia	Hard line to the interwebs is in my roommate's room.  He's left, and I can't get in to get a connection.
2008-10-31T19:29:00.000Z	ikonia	lopin	just trying to understand why you can't do what you did for hardy for interipd
2008-10-31T19:31:00.000Z	lopin	ikonia	I have Build-Essential for Hardy.  Have that on APTonCD even.  However, when I do the upgrade, I have this nasty bug that keeps X from starting.  So, I was going to do a fresh install, so that FGLRX doesn't get involved.  However, without an internet connection to get build-essential, I can't get on the internet.  See the paradox?
2008-10-31T19:31:00.000Z	ikonia	lopin	I most certainly do
2008-10-31T19:31:00.000Z	lopin	ikonia	If I could force build-essential into the iso, then I could do it.  You would think that the alternate iso would have it, right?
2008-10-31T19:32:00.000Z	ikonia	lopin	considered downloading the dvd install ?
2008-10-31T19:33:00.000Z	lopin	ikonia	Completely forgot about the DVD install.  However, that would end up taking forever to download...  but, thanks!  :D
2008-10-31T19:33:00.000Z	ikonia	lopin	it's only 2 gig, just double the cd install
2008-10-31T19:35:00.000Z	lopin	ikonia	The DVD only has additional language packs...  :C
2008-10-31T19:35:00.000Z	ikonia	lopin	no, it has more packages on
2008-10-31T19:39:00.000Z	lopin	ikonia	Maybe it would just be easier to fix the FGLRX bug?
2008-10-31T19:45:00.000Z	ikonia	lopin	could be - but doubtful, thats normally a handful
