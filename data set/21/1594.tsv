2010-08-08T02:22:00.000Z	Tempus_		Ok I have a ? about security....running Lucid firestarter has logged like 8 intrusion attempts...From China...so how do I make sure they are not getting in??
2010-08-08T02:23:00.000Z	Tempus_		What other methods of security can I take to prevent Intrusions or is firestarter pretty safe??
2010-08-08T02:25:00.000Z	duffydack	Tempus_	you should be ok unless you added some server software like apache, ftp etc..  try  netstat -antuwp | egrep "(^[^t])|(^tcp.*LISTEN)"
2010-08-08T02:27:00.000Z	Tempus_	duffydack	what will that command do??
2010-08-08T02:27:00.000Z	duffydack	Tempus_	test for listening port
2010-08-08T02:28:00.000Z	duffydack	Tempus_	you will have 'some' internal stuff, which can be ignored.
2010-08-08T02:29:00.000Z	Tempus_	duffydack	is there any extra measures I can take to insure they dont get in??
2010-08-08T02:29:00.000Z	duffydack	Tempus_	also, fo you have a router/nat or connected direct to the net?
2010-08-08T02:29:00.000Z	duffydack	Tempus_	 switch off..
2010-08-08T02:29:00.000Z	Tempus_	duffydack	for the time being I am connected direct thru eth
2010-08-08T02:30:00.000Z	duffydack	Tempus_	they need something to 'get in' to first, so make sure nothing is listening.
2010-08-08T02:30:00.000Z	duffydack	Tempus_	there are online port scanners also to try.
2010-08-08T02:30:00.000Z	duffydack	Tempus_	but linux+firewall is sufficient.
2010-08-08T02:31:00.000Z	Tempus_	duffydack	checking grc.com right now
2010-08-08T02:32:00.000Z	Tempus_	duffydack	can I send you the log file and have you see if you can figure out who is trying to get in ??
2010-08-08T02:34:00.000Z	duffydack	Tempus_	I wouldnt worry about it..  make sure nothing is sat waiting for a knock knock and you`ll be right.
2010-08-08T02:37:00.000Z	Tempus_	duffydack	ok well grc showed all green as far as stealth goes but replied to ping request...how do i turn that off or modify what the ping request replies to??
2010-08-08T02:38:00.000Z	duffydack	Tempus_	thats a setting in some file somewhere I cant remember, maybe someone else can remember for me :)
2010-08-08T02:38:00.000Z	duffydack	Tempus_	ping is nothing to fear
2010-08-08T02:39:00.000Z	duffydack	Tempus_	doesnt your firewall have something for it?
2010-08-08T02:39:00.000Z	Tempus_	duffydack	I will check but I am running firestarter
