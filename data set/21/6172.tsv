2007-05-23T10:45:00.000Z	orbisvicis		/etc/fstab is also missing devpts & usbdevfs as well as swap ... does ubuntu use those ?
2007-05-23T10:47:00.000Z	orbisvicis		yes, those others are in mount
2007-05-23T10:49:00.000Z	orbisvicis		um used to having devpts and etc being in there from other distros ... hm
2007-05-23T08:00:00.000Z	orbisvicis		with 2 gb of ram, is it normal to see 0 bytes of swap used after opening openoffice, gimp & eclipse ?
2007-05-23T08:01:00.000Z	orbisvicis		i think I fixed my swap partition after reformatting it, but is there any way to make sure it actually works ?
2007-05-23T08:01:00.000Z	ZeroA4	orbisvicis	it is normal... linux only uses swap as a last resorce... its normal to swap lay idle... windows on the onter hand is swap adicted

2007-05-23T09:43:00.000Z	ZeroA4	orbisvicis	beryl depends more of video card than cpu

2007-05-23T09:47:00.000Z	ZeroA4	orbisvicis	should be good. may be you need to change to XGL or config delays in beryl manager
