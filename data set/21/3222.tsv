2009-03-17T02:38:00.000Z	Lenin_Cat		why is ubuntu suddenly saying im not in the sudoers files
2009-03-17T02:38:00.000Z	Lenin_Cat		how do I tell
2009-03-17T02:38:00.000Z	sprinkmeier	Lenin_Cat	are you? did you loose membership to the admin group?
2009-03-17T02:42:00.000Z	sprinkmeier	Lenin_Cat	you may not be listed specifically in the sudoers file, sometimes it just adds members of the admin group
2009-03-17T02:42:00.000Z	Lenin_Cat	sprinkmeier	but I AM the admin
2009-03-17T02:43:00.000Z	sprinkmeier	Lenin_Cat	run "id" and confirm you're in the right groups
2009-03-17T02:43:00.000Z	Lenin_Cat	sprinkmeier	this my computer
2009-03-17T02:43:00.000Z	sprinkmeier	Lenin_Cat	you know that, and I know that, but does you computer know that?
2009-03-17T02:44:00.000Z	Lenin_Cat	sprinkmeier	odd, ID says im not in the root group
2009-03-17T02:45:00.000Z	Lenin_Cat	sprinkmeier	should I log out and in
2009-03-17T02:46:00.000Z	sprinkmeier	Lenin_Cat	you shouldn't be in the root groun (GID=0), just the admin group (or adm, or wheel, distro dependant) which sudoers uses to give you access when required
2009-03-17T02:46:00.000Z	Lenin_Cat	sprinkmeier	well im not in that ether
2009-03-17T02:47:00.000Z	Lenin_Cat	sprinkmeier	how do I put myself in there
2009-03-17T02:48:00.000Z	sprinkmeier	Lenin_Cat	the account created at system install should be a member of all the right groups. To add yourself, run "usermod -aG wheel USERNAME" as root
2009-03-17T02:48:00.000Z	Lenin_Cat	sprinkmeier	but I cant run as root
2009-03-17T02:48:00.000Z	Lenin_Cat	sprinkmeier	I lost root control somehow
2009-03-17T02:48:00.000Z	sprinkmeier	Lenin_Cat	reboot into recovery mode?
2009-03-17T02:49:00.000Z	sprinkmeier	Lenin_Cat	(forgot... recovery mode now requests root password, catch 22) try a live CD?
2009-03-17T02:49:00.000Z	Lenin_Cat	sprinkmeier	but how do I acess this installation via live cd
2009-03-17T02:50:00.000Z	sprinkmeier	Lenin_Cat	mount the partitions (Should be easy enough through GUI) and then either chroot or manually munge the shadow/passwd/sudoers/group files
2009-03-17T02:55:00.000Z	Lenin_Cat	sprinkmeier	thanks
