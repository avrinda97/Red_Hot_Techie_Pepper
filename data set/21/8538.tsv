2006-04-28T05:20:00.000Z	pvd2006	soundray	no
2006-04-28T05:03:00.000Z	soundray	pvd2006	no, you have to convert to wav format if you want an audio CD. I recommend k3b, it does it for you.
2006-04-28T05:12:00.000Z	soundray	pvd2006	you've had the answer above. Install k3b-mp3
2006-04-28T05:12:00.000Z	pvd2006	soundray	sorry about that, didnt see it.
2006-04-28T05:16:00.000Z	pvd2006	soundray	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/12748 I got this error of a unmet dependency when I tried to install k3b-mp3.
2006-04-28T05:18:00.000Z	soundray	pvd2006	looks like you've mixed ubuntu versions.
2006-04-28T05:19:00.000Z	pvd2006	soundray	I am using breezy badger, at one time I accidently had hoary hedgehog sources but I changed it.
2006-04-28T05:20:00.000Z	soundray	pvd2006	did you apt-get update before you installed k3b-mp3?
2006-04-28T05:24:00.000Z	pvd2006	soundray	I think I got it to work, I completely removed all of k3b and did apt-get upgrade and then re-installed it and k3b-mp3 and it didnt give me any errors.
2006-04-28T05:24:00.000Z	soundray	pvd2006	well done. It should work now.
2006-04-28T05:30:00.000Z	pvd2006	soundray	is it ok for the cd burner to have a red light when im burning? according to k3b its burning fine.
2006-04-28T05:30:00.000Z	soundray	pvd2006	yes, that's probably okay.
2006-05-14T16:56:00.000Z	soundray	pvd2006	only if you recompile the ntfs kernel module (not recommended)
2006-05-14T16:57:00.000Z	soundray	pvd2006	NTFS is a crufty, kludgy, closed-source mess. Chances are it'll never be decently supported.
2006-05-14T16:58:00.000Z	soundray	pvd2006	best to have a small fat32 data partition for exchanging data.
2006-05-14T16:59:00.000Z	soundray	pvd2006	or use a USB stick.
2006-05-14T05:01:00.000Z	soundray	pvd2006	it is. This is all based on the suggestion of having an extra partition for shared data between the OS's
2006-05-14T05:09:00.000Z	soundray	pvd2006	it's exceedingly stable, considering it's still beta
2006-05-26T05:55:00.000Z	soundray	pvd2006	you can feed a badblocks list to the formatter when creating a filesystem. man mke2fs
2006-05-26T05:56:00.000Z	pvd2006	soundray	what do you think I am a linux user or something?!?!
