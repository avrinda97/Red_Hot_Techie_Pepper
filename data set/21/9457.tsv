2005-09-18T05:24:00.000Z	Smoking_n00b	bob2	thanks
2005-09-18T05:24:00.000Z	bob2	Smoking_n00b	the installer explained this and made you hit 'enter' at one point...
2005-09-18T05:25:00.000Z	Smoking_n00b	bob2	i installed konsole from synaptic, but cant seem to launch it or find it, any ideas?
2005-09-18T05:27:00.000Z	bob2	Smoking_n00b	alt-f2 konsole <enter>
2005-09-18T05:28:00.000Z	Smoking_n00b	bob2	thank you :)
2005-09-18T05:28:00.000Z	bob2	Smoking_n00b	you can use the menu editor "smeg" to put it in the menu if you like
2005-09-18T05:29:00.000Z	Smoking_n00b	bob2	it launched konsole, but i am used to typing MC to get midnight commander. this didnt work ,what have i done wrong?
2005-09-18T05:29:00.000Z	bob2	Smoking_n00b	did you install mc?
2005-09-18T05:30:00.000Z	Smoking_n00b	bob2	,no. i thought it was a part of konsole, i installed konsole
2005-09-18T05:30:00.000Z	bob2	Smoking_n00b	no, midnight commander is another program that existed for about ten years before konsole did
2005-09-18T05:30:00.000Z	bob2	Smoking_n00b	install "mc" with your packagemananegemtn tool of choice
2005-09-18T05:31:00.000Z	Smoking_n00b	bob2	thanks , i will try to do that.
2005-09-18T05:32:00.000Z	Smoking_n00b	bob2	i search in synaptic package manager for midnight commander, it only finds the konsole that i installed earlier. is there another search place i can use with synaptic?
2005-09-18T05:33:00.000Z	bob2	Smoking_n00b	^^
2005-09-18T05:33:00.000Z	bob2	Smoking_n00b	it's in universe in the package called "mc"
2005-09-18T05:33:00.000Z	Smoking_n00b	bob2	thanks again
2005-09-18T05:34:00.000Z	bob2	Smoking_n00b	select, middle click to paste it
2005-09-18T05:38:00.000Z	Smoking_n00b	bob2	why are some software sources disabled by default?
2005-09-18T05:39:00.000Z	bob2	Smoking_n00b	because people should know they're going to install unsupported or non-free crap before selecting it in synaptic
