2008-06-29T19:02:00.000Z	plouffe		Anyone know how many linux viruses there are?
2008-06-29T19:02:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	plouffe	probably in the single digits.
2008-06-29T19:03:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	plouffe	i somehow have a hard time believing that.
2008-06-29T19:07:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	plouffe	i didn't say they don't exist, only an idiot would suggest otherwise, so its not my facts are wrong, its your reading comprehension
2008-06-29T19:08:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	plouffe	if it has tob e explained to you, then you wouldn't get it... go back to #windows
2008-07-13T18:27:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	plouffe	i can already tell you, no its not.
2008-07-13T18:29:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	plouffe	the problem is, that device is not actualy an AR242x it gets misdetected by the ubuntu kernel
2008-07-13T18:30:00.000Z	plouffe	IndyGunFreak	so what do I need to do?
2008-07-13T18:30:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	plouffe	what model laptop is that?
2008-07-13T18:30:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	plouffe	there's a lot of info on Google getting that device to work.
2008-07-13T18:37:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	plouffe	so when it showed up in network manager, were yuou able to get on a network?
2008-07-13T18:37:00.000Z	plouffe	IndyGunFreak	no it doesn't list any networks. I tried wifi-radar too
2008-07-13T18:39:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	plouffe	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=766529         Post #7.. if that doesn't work(which usually it does, but doesn't for me)... i can help you w/ it later.
2008-07-13T18:40:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	plouffe	are you using 32bit or 64bit
2008-07-13T18:40:00.000Z	plouffe	IndyGunFreak	THanks, I'll have a look.
2008-07-13T18:40:00.000Z	plouffe	IndyGunFreak	64 bit amd
2008-07-13T18:40:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	plouffe	thats probably a lot of you're issue.
2008-07-13T18:41:00.000Z	plouffe	IndyGunFreak	I am new to this. Is it a lot of hassle to switch to 32bit?
2008-07-13T18:41:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	plouffe	you would have to reinstall.. but honestly, i always recommend newbs use 32bit, unless they need 64bit, as there are some inherent issues w/ 64bit that will frustrate.
2008-07-13T18:44:00.000Z	plouffe	IndyGunFreak	so on http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download I just choose Standard personal computer?
2008-07-13T18:45:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	plouffe	yes.
