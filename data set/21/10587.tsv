2005-05-28T06:43:00.000Z	repete	LinuxJones	I know it is supported (atheros chipset).  I just don't know how to add an interface in a Debian-based distro
2005-05-28T06:43:00.000Z	LinuxJones	repete	sudo network-admin
2005-05-28T06:44:00.000Z	repete	LinuxJones	that doesn't help either.  There is no way to add an interface.  Just change the one that are there.
2005-05-28T06:44:00.000Z	LinuxJones	repete	what ?
2005-05-28T06:44:00.000Z	repete	LinuxJones	That is what I thought.  It doesn't sound right.
2005-05-28T06:44:00.000Z	repete		but afaict I am up to date
2005-05-28T06:45:00.000Z	LinuxJones	repete	there used to be on there wtf ?
2005-05-28T06:46:00.000Z	LinuxJones	repete	that's useless :D
2005-05-28T06:46:00.000Z	repete	LinuxJones	Tell me about it :-/
2005-05-28T06:47:00.000Z	repete	LinuxJones	Is there instructions on adding an interface manually?
2005-05-28T06:48:00.000Z	LinuxJones	repete	well if you know the module name just modprobe the network card driver and hope it shows up in network-admin I guess at this point :(
2005-05-28T06:49:00.000Z	repete	LinuxJones	Nope. :-/  I already did that, and it still doesn't show up...
2005-05-28T06:49:00.000Z	repete		<sigh>
2005-05-28T06:50:00.000Z	repete	LinuxJones	thx for the help though
