2009-03-03T14:24:00.000Z	Frantic		can anyone please help me find out if my mobo raid is fake raid or real hardware raid? here are my system specs, including the mobo: http://h18000.www1.hp.com/products/quickspecs/12848_na/12848_na.html
2009-03-03T14:24:00.000Z	ikonia	Frantic	it's fake
2009-03-03T14:24:00.000Z	ikonia	Frantic	your LSI pci card may not be though
2009-03-03T14:25:00.000Z	Frantic	ikonia	I don't have the pci card, I want a sata raid, and the mobo manual actually says that the PCI card is only for SAS raid and that the mobo should be used for SATA raid
2009-03-03T14:26:00.000Z	Frantic	ikonia	still sure it's fake raid?
2009-03-03T14:26:00.000Z	ikonia	Frantic	yup
2009-03-03T14:27:00.000Z	Frantic	ikonia	can you please tell me why? :0
2009-03-03T14:27:00.000Z	ikonia	Frantic	because it's not listing a supported raid controller
2009-03-03T14:27:00.000Z	Frantic	ikonia	lspci -v is listing a raid controller
2009-03-03T14:28:00.000Z	ikonia	Frantic	so ?
2009-03-03T14:28:00.000Z	ikonia	Frantic	raid controller could be fake raid
2009-03-03T14:28:00.000Z	ikonia	Frantic	plus the big words "Linux not supported" is a good sign
2009-03-03T14:28:00.000Z	Frantic	ikonia	linux not supported means they dont offer tech support I guess :)
2009-03-03T14:28:00.000Z	ikonia	Frantic	no - you guessed wrong
2009-03-03T14:29:00.000Z	ikonia	Frantic	it's a fake raid board, which is why it's not supported on linux
2009-03-03T14:29:00.000Z	Frantic	ikonia	ok, thanks anyway :)
2009-03-03T14:29:00.000Z	Frantic	ikonia	do you know if linux software raid impacts cpu performance by much?
2009-03-03T14:30:00.000Z	ikonia	Frantic	you won't see it on any modern cpu
2009-03-03T14:31:00.000Z	Frantic	ikonia	I just created a mdadm raid5 volume, so now it's syncing (or whatever), and I have a md0_raid5 and md0_resync process using 12 and 5 % CPU, is this normal? under normal operation will it stay up like this? or is it just while the syncing is happening?
2009-03-03T14:31:00.000Z	ikonia	Frantic	syncing will always be a big overhead compared to normal running
2009-03-03T14:32:00.000Z	Frantic	ikonia	thanks :)
