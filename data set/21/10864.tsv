2005-04-04T13:53:00.000Z	samatman		so lsmod lists the modules installed?
2005-04-04T13:54:00.000Z	samatman		oh, ok
2005-04-04T13:54:00.000Z	samatman		ok...how do i find out if there is a module for a prism2 chipset wireless device?
2005-04-04T13:54:00.000Z	Seveas	samatman	there is
2005-04-04T13:56:00.000Z	Seveas	samatman	if the module must always be loaded, add it to /etc/modules
2005-04-04T13:57:00.000Z	Seveas	samatman	don't use dselect if you don't know it, rather try synaptic (graphical interface) or aptitude (terminal based)
2005-04-04T14:15:00.000Z	Seveas	samatman	i don't think so
2005-04-04T14:20:00.000Z	Seveas	samatman	if you type echo $? it must say 0
2005-04-04T14:22:00.000Z	Seveas	samatman	iwconfig gives no output?
2005-04-04T14:23:00.000Z	Seveas	samatman	then something else must be wrong
2005-04-04T14:26:00.000Z	Seveas	samatman	no, just hold on for a sec
2005-04-04T14:28:00.000Z	Seveas	samatman	try this http://atmelwlandriver.sourceforge.net/howto/howto-5.html#ss5.1
2005-04-04T16:47:00.000Z	Seveas	samatman	yes
2005-04-04T16:51:00.000Z	Seveas	samatman	you need to use `` instead of ''
2005-04-04T16:51:00.000Z	Seveas	samatman	yes, that one, they're called backticks
2005-04-04T16:53:00.000Z	Seveas	samatman	can you paste the output of make on pastebin.com
