2008-03-25T08:31:00.000Z	sk8ball		thats what pisses me off about linux, and is exactly what is preventing widespread adoption ... too much is dependant about manual editing of config files .... i like to be able to edit them manually but i like to have access to a gui frontend as welll... really increases productivity
2008-03-25T08:33:00.000Z	sk8ball		chameleon, exactly all these system setup/config should be gui accessible
2008-03-25T08:33:00.000Z	sk8ball		chameleon,
2008-03-25T08:33:00.000Z	calc	sk8ball	fwiw the new version of Xorg will soon autodetect everything
2008-03-25T08:33:00.000Z	sk8ball	calc	when is it due out?
2008-03-25T08:33:00.000Z	calc	sk8ball	so xorg.conf will be empty (more or less)
2008-03-25T08:34:00.000Z	calc	sk8ball	no gui, it will just autodetect all settings
2008-03-25T08:34:00.000Z	calc	sk8ball	sudo su -
2008-03-25T08:34:00.000Z	calc	sk8ball	root password is disabled so you can't do a direct su
2008-03-25T08:36:00.000Z	calc	sk8ball	ettercap might have to be run as root
2008-03-25T08:36:00.000Z	calc	sk8ball	since it is a packet sniffer
2008-03-25T08:36:00.000Z	sk8ball	calc	yah i think so
2008-03-25T08:36:00.000Z	sk8ball	calc	so will sudo resolve that or ?
2008-03-25T08:37:00.000Z	calc	sk8ball	if you run sudo (ettercap's binary name) yea i think so
2008-03-25T08:37:00.000Z	calc	sk8ball	looks like the version in hardy is already fixed to run as root
2008-03-25T08:38:00.000Z	calc	sk8ball	things generally shouldn't run as root unless they need to ettercap not running as root was a bug which was fixed in the last upload
2008-03-25T08:38:00.000Z	sk8ball	calc	is there a way to edit the command the shortcuts in the applications menu are using?
2008-03-25T08:39:00.000Z	sk8ball	calc	or someway to fix my menu shortcut for it
2008-03-25T08:39:00.000Z	calc	sk8ball	yea, edit them in /usr/share/applications or copy and override them
2008-03-25T08:39:00.000Z	calc	sk8ball	if you edit them directly in /usr/share/applications they will get overwritten at upgrade time
2008-03-25T08:40:00.000Z	calc	sk8ball	eg:
