2008-08-30T07:14:00.000Z	QickSilver_		Could anyone help me?
2008-08-30T07:16:00.000Z	bofh80	QickSilver_	does your latest downloaded ISO pass the integrity check ?
2008-08-30T07:16:00.000Z	QickSilver_	bofh80	None of the ones I've downloaded do, it looks like the same file.
2008-08-30T07:17:00.000Z	bofh80	QickSilver_	are you downloading the ISO from the same mirror each time?
2008-08-30T07:17:00.000Z	QickSilver_	bofh80	No, the first two are from mirrors, the third from the ubuntu release website.
2008-08-30T07:18:00.000Z	QickSilver_	bofh80	The third ISO just stopped at 44% again.
2008-08-30T07:18:00.000Z	bofh80	QickSilver_	it might be worth giving the Alternate CD a go?
2008-08-30T07:18:00.000Z	QickSilver_	bofh80	I'll try it.
2008-08-30T07:20:00.000Z	QickSilver_	bofh80	Any reason why the alternate is 5 MB more in size? o.O
2008-08-30T07:21:00.000Z	bofh80	QickSilver_	i have no idea :)
2008-08-30T07:21:00.000Z	QickSilver_	bofh80	Does it come with the software pre-installed?
2008-08-30T07:21:00.000Z	QickSilver_	bofh80	Like firefox and gaim?
2008-08-30T07:22:00.000Z	bofh80	QickSilver_	the final installation should come out the same.
2008-08-30T07:22:00.000Z	QickSilver_	bofh80	Ok, I'd try it earlier but I was worried about that.
2008-08-30T07:23:00.000Z	QickSilver_	bofh80	I'm using my old computer for ubuntu so I can play games on windows and still have linux.
2008-08-30T07:24:00.000Z	QickSilver_	bofh80	Oh, does ubuntu have any good telnet clients?
2008-08-30T07:24:00.000Z	bofh80	QickSilver_	it has telnet, and shh, etc. do you mean a gui? what do you want telnet for?
2008-08-30T07:25:00.000Z	QickSilver_	bofh80	Even though I like gaming in graphic intense games, I still do roleplay in MUDs so I need one that I won't lose my text in heavy RP
2008-08-30T07:26:00.000Z	bofh80	QickSilver_	lol, what did you use in windows?
2008-08-30T07:26:00.000Z	QickSilver_	bofh80	mushclient
2008-08-30T07:27:00.000Z	bofh80	QickSilver_	i'd look at what bastid_raZor is sayin, telnet talkers aint my thing :)
