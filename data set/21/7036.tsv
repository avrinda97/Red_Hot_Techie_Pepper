2007-01-04T16:57:00.000Z	VMT2007	Tenen	sudo apt-get install build-essential
2007-01-04T16:59:00.000Z	VMT2007	Tenen	kismet? just look for a package
2007-01-04T17:00:00.000Z	VMT2007	Tenen	you are not going to get answers by trolling
2007-01-04T17:01:00.000Z	VMT2007	Tenen	did you download 6.10 or 6.06
2007-01-04T17:02:00.000Z	VMT2007	Tenen	actually you just double click them
2007-01-04T17:02:00.000Z	VMT2007	Tenen	packages.ubuntu.com
2007-01-04T17:03:00.000Z	VMT2007	Tenen	Wireless configuration on Linux is no walk in the park
2007-01-04T17:04:00.000Z	VMT2007	Tenen	additionally Ubuntu does not come with the build tools by default
2007-01-04T17:06:00.000Z	VMT2007	Tenen	yeah but once you configure your wireless adapter you can use synaptic :P
2007-01-04T17:09:00.000Z	VMT2007	Tenen	err?
2007-01-04T17:22:00.000Z	VMT2007	Tenen	debian/ubuntu have superior package management to windows
