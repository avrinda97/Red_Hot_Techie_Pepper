2007-03-20T07:14:00.000Z	aeroplane		is there anyone here who would be willing to help me with some issues I am having understanding how to use the make command?
2007-03-20T07:15:00.000Z	aeroplane		When I use the make command to compile source packages, I consistently get this error. make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found. Stop.
2007-03-20T07:15:00.000Z	aeroplane		what do i do to avoid this?
2007-03-20T07:16:00.000Z	aeroplane		I have done that
2007-03-20T07:16:00.000Z	aeroplane		yes and yes
2007-03-20T07:16:00.000Z	ardchoille	aeroplane	Some sources require that you run ./configure first
2007-03-20T07:16:00.000Z	aeroplane		and i have cded into the directory first.
2007-03-20T07:17:00.000Z	aeroplane	bruenig	i have tried three of four since i installed, and i get the same error.
2007-03-20T07:17:00.000Z	ardchoille	aeroplane	DO the sources include a README or INSTALL file?
2007-03-20T07:17:00.000Z	aeroplane		yes.
2007-03-20T07:18:00.000Z	ardchoille	aeroplane	And have you read them?
2007-03-20T07:18:00.000Z	aeroplane		i have followed their directions.
2007-03-20T07:18:00.000Z	ardchoille	aeroplane	So you don't need to run ./configure first?
2007-03-20T07:18:00.000Z	aeroplane		i think i have done everything correctly. I have run ./configure on each package that told me to.
2007-03-20T07:19:00.000Z	ardchoille	aeroplane	You got a link to that package?
2007-03-20T07:19:00.000Z	aeroplane		yah, one second to grab it .
2007-03-20T07:19:00.000Z	aeroplane		http://downloads.sourceforge.net/gaim/gaim-2.0.0beta6.tar.gz?modtime=1169170207&big_mirror=1
2007-03-20T07:19:00.000Z	aeroplane		that is the most recent package i tried.
2007-03-20T07:21:00.000Z	aeroplane		oh, i have not checked if it asked for mroe dependencies, i will try that, thanks
2007-03-20T07:21:00.000Z	aeroplane	bruenig	i will try that for this one, thanks.
2007-03-20T07:21:00.000Z	ardchoille	aeroplane	Basically, the ./configure creates a make file and if you get even one error during ./configure, you won't get a make file.
