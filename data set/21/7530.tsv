2006-09-13T16:13:00.000Z	gean		i'm just reporting ubuntu-install: Just 1 keyboard option (US), unfortunately other bought keyboard on laptop; install CD is ``workin' '', but i got the question: boot CD-ROM driver from floppy ? (or so, tanslated fom German... hm bad issue..)
2006-09-13T16:15:00.000Z	gean		i'm just reporting ubuntu-install: ok, no floppy option chosen... no cd-rom driver...
2006-09-13T09:18:00.000Z	gean		hi all! i have hard problems to detect my laptop CD-Rom (no floppy!), is it possible to install from live CD, if yes where is this livd-cd ?!
2006-09-13T09:19:00.000Z	JosefK	gean	the ubuntu site doesn't even bother listing floppies anymore.  you can install from the live CD, yes, at http://www.ubuntu.com/download
2006-09-13T09:20:00.000Z	gean	JosefK	thought,  ubuntu-6.06.1-desktop-i386.iso also has a live possibility installed, but there is none..
2006-09-13T09:20:00.000Z	JosefK	gean	it should be right there on the desktop
2006-09-13T09:22:00.000Z	gean	JosefK	well: i'm booting from CD, then the menu on it has only : Install in text mode // Install in OEM mode  // Install a server // Check CD for... // Rescue ... // Mem test // Boot from 1st HD //
2006-09-13T09:22:00.000Z	JosefK	gean	that's not the live CD ;)
2006-09-13T09:22:00.000Z	JosefK	gean	looks like you've got the alternative or the server install disc, I'll get you a direct link...
2006-09-13T09:23:00.000Z	JosefK	gean	http://se.releases.ubuntu.com/6.06/ - click the 'PC (Intel x86) Desktop CD' link
2006-09-13T09:25:00.000Z	gean	JosefK	OK, i'll go first for desktop-cd... (also burned) BUT : it gave me NO chance to interact!  Error was : [ /bin/sh .... things not found... ]  i've googled the error, it was a long story... it seems, that there are special problems in recognizing my CD-ROM (&other HD-stuff)
2006-09-13T09:25:00.000Z	gean	JosefK	i'll try again and report..
2006-09-13T09:25:00.000Z	JosefK	gean	obscure :/ the live CD definitely shouldn't have those boot options
2006-09-13T09:27:00.000Z	gean	JosefK	The  ubuntu-6.06.1-desktop-i386.iso  was running, second item was Mounting root fs, there it breaks, gives me the error & a # sign...
2006-09-13T09:27:00.000Z	JosefK	gean	if you had those boot options, I'd check it wasn't a bad download
2006-09-13T09:28:00.000Z	JosefK	gean	looks like there was one false start, so it may be worth making sure you're getting the new one
2006-09-13T09:29:00.000Z	gean	JosefK	the version i have is downloaded last 2-5 days... (and burned as an iso)....
2006-09-13T09:29:00.000Z	gean	JosefK	ok, desktop-distro starting boot: in menu: Start or install ubuntu..
2006-09-13T09:30:00.000Z	JosefK	gean	the first option, to load the desktop
2006-09-13T09:30:00.000Z	JosefK	gean	fast connection ;)
2006-09-13T09:33:00.000Z	gean	JosefK	Jack_Sparrow: the following message appears: Uncomp.. Linux.. OK, booting the kenel// BusyBox v1.01 et caetera // Enter 'help' ... // !!! /bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off !!! -- is this a common error ?!
