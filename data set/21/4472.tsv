2011-01-20T23:15:00.000Z	undecim	gpled	Run ssh with -vv and see what part it's slow on
2011-01-20T23:17:00.000Z	gpled	undecim	thanks.   looks like its trying different authentication mettods
2011-01-20T23:20:00.000Z	gpled	undecim	is their a way for the client to tell the server which method to start with?  notice putty is real quick when connecting from m$
2011-01-20T23:20:00.000Z	undecim	gpled	Not sure...
2011-01-20T23:21:00.000Z	undecim	gpled	What auth methods does it try, in which order?
2011-01-20T23:21:00.000Z	gpled	undecim	just about everything it can, before droping to password
2011-01-20T23:22:00.000Z	undecim	gpled	You can do like '-o "RSAAuthentication No"' to make it not use pubkey auth, etc.
2011-01-20T23:22:00.000Z	undecim	gpled	Put those in the config files to make them permanent
2011-01-20T23:22:00.000Z	undecim	gpled	~/.ssh/config for user-wide settings
2011-01-20T23:22:00.000Z	gpled	undecim	i think this is slowing it down more then the auth methods.   Cannot determine realm for numeric host address
2011-01-20T23:23:00.000Z	gpled	undecim	k, thanks for the -vv tip.  does debug1 mean client and 2 server?
2011-01-20T23:24:00.000Z	undecim	gpled	A quick google says that adding a line for the server to /etc/hosts will speed it up
2011-01-20T23:24:00.000Z	undecim	gpled	e.g. "192.168.1.23 mysshserver", then you can connect with either the IP or "mysshserver" and it should be faster
2011-01-20T23:25:00.000Z	gpled	undecim	smells like ssh is trying to resolve DNS names.   bet their is a way to turn that off
2011-01-20T23:26:00.000Z	undecim	gpled	Not that I can find.
2011-01-20T23:27:00.000Z	gpled	undecim	found it on the sever side, but not client
2011-01-20T23:28:00.000Z	gpled	undecim	UseDNS no
2011-01-20T23:28:00.000Z	undecim	gpled	Have you tried adding the line to /etc/hosts?
2011-01-20T23:28:00.000Z	gpled	undecim	 not yet. i connect by ip, and dont realy have dns on this lan yet
2011-01-20T23:33:00.000Z	gpled	undecim	 ip hostname of server in /etc/hosts made it work
2011-01-20T23:33:00.000Z	undecim	gpled	Nice.
