2008-08-23T20:34:00.000Z	jorritlinnert	srboritez	Depends on what cipset your WLAN card has.
2008-08-23T20:35:00.000Z	jorritlinnert	srboritez	OK, but you have problems getting WLAN working, right?
2008-08-23T20:36:00.000Z	jorritlinnert	srboritez	Are you using a laptop or a desktop?
2008-08-23T20:37:00.000Z	jorritlinnert	srboritez	Which machine runs Ubuntu, your laptop or your desktop?
2008-08-23T20:38:00.000Z	jorritlinnert	srboritez	try lspci on the cmd_line, this will give you a description of all PCI cards installed, which will probably include your WLAN card
2008-08-23T20:39:00.000Z	jorritlinnert	srboritez	Ah, you're using Ubuntu on both systems? So what chipset does your WLAN have?
2008-08-23T20:39:00.000Z	jorritlinnert	srboritez	It should be included in the information you got from lspci
2008-08-23T20:41:00.000Z	jorritlinnert	srboritez	What brand and type of WLAN card do you use?
2008-08-23T20:42:00.000Z	jorritlinnert	srboritez	That's a Broadcom chipset, that should work with MadWifi drivers.
2008-08-23T20:44:00.000Z	jorritlinnert	srboritez	That might be hard to get working. Most USB NIC's are not supported on Linux
2008-08-23T20:46:00.000Z	jorritlinnert	srboritez	Ralink drivers are tricky to get working, because you need the firmware from the Ralink website
2008-08-23T20:46:00.000Z	jorritlinnert	srboritez	Does it work?
2008-08-23T20:47:00.000Z	jorritlinnert	srboritez	If you are wardriving, be sure to have a secure system before you connect (!)
2008-08-23T20:48:00.000Z	jorritlinnert	srboritez	What encryption are you using on your WLAN?
2008-08-23T20:49:00.000Z	jorritlinnert	srboritez	Did you enter the correct passphrase/ code for it?
2008-08-23T20:50:00.000Z	jorritlinnert	srboritez	Still I'd look for a solution in the encryption, because you can get a connection from an unprotected network
2008-08-23T20:51:00.000Z	jorritlinnert	srboritez	Last time I used my Ralink2500 I couldn't get it working with WPA, only WEP. fyi: WEP can be cracked in under 3 seconds.
2008-08-23T20:56:00.000Z	jorritlinnert	srboritez	You might try iwpriv as LSD|Ninja suggested
2008-08-23T20:58:00.000Z	jorritlinnert	srboritez	LSD|Ninja is more of an expert on this than I am. Listen to him/ her
