2011-01-04T13:13:00.000Z	UBUxUBU		you just boot ubuntu boot and all on about 11-12 gb partition or more and then make a fat32 for the files and gparted will do all of it
2011-01-04T13:14:00.000Z	cryptodira	UBUxUBU	nothing but 10.04... fresh install.   during the install process, if i make multiple partitions, then near the finish i get a failure to install grub....and it will not install on any partition..... rebooting at that point results in a kernel panic/failure to boot.   IF i allow ubuntu to make one partition during install.... everything works...but i am left with only one partiton and a swap  and one extended both of 11 gigs
2011-01-04T13:19:00.000Z	cryptodira	UBUxUBU	 nope,, caught that box.
2011-01-04T13:28:00.000Z	UBUxUBU	cryptodira	so the 1st is primary / ext 3 or 4, then the next one is fat32
2011-01-04T13:28:00.000Z	UBUxUBU	cryptodira	well the next is swap actuallt then fat32
2011-01-04T13:28:00.000Z	cryptodira	UBUxUBU	all ext4 and nothing else
2011-01-04T13:29:00.000Z	UBUxUBU	cryptodira	how big is your HD
2011-01-04T13:29:00.000Z	cryptodira	UBUxUBU	what is the advantage of having FAT if *nix is the only os being run?
2011-01-04T13:30:00.000Z	cryptodira	UBUxUBU	half a terabyte
2011-01-04T13:30:00.000Z	UBUxUBU	cryptodira	well for example if buntu gets corrupt u can pullt the dead HD and stick in in any desktop and get thefiles
2011-01-04T13:32:00.000Z	cryptodira	UBUxUBU	good point.... the only other machine i have access to is an ancient os/2 with jfs.... i live in the mountains, off grid and do not get out in the winter.
2011-01-04T13:33:00.000Z	UBUxUBU	cryptodira	example: 1st partition-15gb ubuntu ext 4, 2nd partition swap 2 gb, 3rd fat32 rest of the drive
2011-01-04T13:33:00.000Z	cryptodira	UBUxUBU	that is similar to one of the attempts i made, 'cept without fat... all ext4 instead.... it still failed
2011-01-04T13:33:00.000Z	UBUxUBU	cryptodira	but honestly i would use ext 3
2011-01-04T13:34:00.000Z	UBUxUBU	cryptodira	i have done like 30 of them lately
2011-01-04T13:35:00.000Z	cryptodira	UBUxUBU	on/with amd64 chipsets?
2011-01-04T13:35:00.000Z	cryptodira	UBUxUBU	yes, i chose 4 because of huge files.
2011-01-04T13:37:00.000Z	UBUxUBU	cryptodira	i have a channel called ##dualbooter which i plan on using for step by step instructions if anyone needs it and i mean every single step
2011-01-04T13:37:00.000Z	UBUxUBU	cryptodira	i actually wrote down ever single step every keystroke hehe
2011-01-04T13:39:00.000Z	UBUxUBU	cryptodira	u deal with bazhang and rww i am out
2011-01-04T13:39:00.000Z	cryptodira	UBUxUBU	Thank You for your help.... i will ponder on this a bit.
