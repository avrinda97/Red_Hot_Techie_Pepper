2007-12-18T00:28:00.000Z	FremontC		Hello, I am attempting to develop a USB application using libusb (cvs) on Ubuntu 6.06, kernel 2.6.15.7. Are there know problems with this combo? I get 'Operation not permitted' error messages.
2007-12-18T00:28:00.000Z	ikonia	FremontC	what operation
2007-12-18T00:29:00.000Z	FremontC	ikonia	libusb's 'make check' and others
2007-12-18T00:29:00.000Z	ikonia	FremontC	why are you doing "make check" as libusb is already installed on ubuntu
2007-12-18T00:29:00.000Z	ikonia	FremontC	libusb comes package for ubuntu
2007-12-18T00:31:00.000Z	FremontC	ikonia	I believe the 6.06 libusb package is 0.1.12, which is obsolescent? I have installed libusb0.1.13 cvs, and am getting error with that
2007-12-18T00:31:00.000Z	ikonia	FremontC	why
2007-12-18T00:31:00.000Z	FremontC	ikonia	why I get the error is the question.
2007-12-18T00:31:00.000Z	ikonia	FremontC	why do you need .13
2007-12-18T00:33:00.000Z	FremontC	ikonia	Because from my readings about libusb, 0.1.12 is obsolescent, and appears not to have the commands to talk to devices. the cvs version does.
2007-12-18T00:33:00.000Z	ikonia	FremontC	should do
2007-12-18T00:35:00.000Z	FremontC	ikonia	Are you stating that Dapper Drake 6.06 comes with the LATEST libusb, with full documentation, all working?
2007-12-18T00:36:00.000Z	ikonia	FremontC	no, I'm saying it comes with a stable packaged version which should be used for deployment on the 6.06 platform
2007-12-18T00:36:00.000Z	FremontC	ikonia	OK. Well that fits. Its an old version. Maybe stabel, but lacks a lot of utility.
2007-12-18T00:37:00.000Z	ikonia	FremontC	no point developing on later versions not shipped with ubuntu
2007-12-18T00:38:00.000Z	FremontC	ikonia	does any later ubuntu version (than 6.06) have the later libusb version?
2007-12-18T00:38:00.000Z	ikonia	FremontC	I believe so
2007-12-18T00:39:00.000Z	FremontC	ikonia	waht ubuntu version has the later libusb version?
2007-12-18T00:39:00.000Z	ikonia	FremontC	7.10 at a guess
2007-12-18T00:40:00.000Z	FremontC	ikonia	OK Ty.
2007-12-18T00:40:00.000Z	ikonia	FremontC	welcome
