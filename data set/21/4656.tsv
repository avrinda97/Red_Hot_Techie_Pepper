2010-03-11T04:48:00.000Z	IdleOne	chelz	it is also used for when you want to do fresh installs of the new release and don't want to have to do backups
2010-03-11T04:49:00.000Z	chelz	IdleOne	how does ubuntu handle between versions with a separate home? i've been thinking about doing that but i'm really not sure how the legacy config files would work out
2010-03-11T04:50:00.000Z	IdleOne	chelz	I have never had any issues, your milleage may vary. I don't see why the configs would change so much from one version to next that it would break things
2010-03-11T04:51:00.000Z	chelz	IdleOne	do you only use it for upgrades or for btween distros?
2010-03-11T04:51:00.000Z	IdleOne	chelz	I bleed ubuntu brown :)
2010-03-11T04:52:00.000Z	chelz	IdleOne	do you ever get prompted with anything that there's a config mismatch or that older configs have to be replaced? or is it usually all automated?
2010-03-11T04:52:00.000Z	IdleOne	chelz	nope never. I have done upgrades and fresh installs and use the same /home. no issues
2010-03-11T04:53:00.000Z	chelz	IdleOne	huh.. what versions have you gone between?
2010-03-11T04:55:00.000Z	IdleOne	chelz	I have been upgrading since 5.10 and also doing fresh installs. last 4 versions with same /home
2010-03-11T04:55:00.000Z	chelz	IdleOne	how do you usually handle reinstalling stuff you had installed before?
2010-03-11T04:56:00.000Z	chelz	IdleOne	i've seen stuff like that, including stuff with dpkg -l, but it just seems like that could lead to a world of hurt with packages having different names
2010-03-11T04:57:00.000Z	IdleOne	chelz	the package names very rarely if ever change names
2010-03-11T04:57:00.000Z	chelz	IdleOne	is that clone method how you reinstall stuff?
2010-03-11T04:57:00.000Z	IdleOne	chelz	from one distro to the next the names change but within the same distro not normally
2010-03-11T04:58:00.000Z	IdleOne	chelz	yes I have used it before.
2010-03-11T04:58:00.000Z	chelz	IdleOne	no issues? at all?
2010-03-11T04:59:00.000Z	IdleOne	chelz	the seperate home, for me at least, is more about not having to backup my media files when doing a fresh install. I don't really mind having to re-install apps and such if I have to
2010-03-11T05:00:00.000Z	chelz	IdleOne	ah, yeah that could work for me. i've held back upgrading ubuntu for a while just because things seem to be working and i don't want to go through some headache of stuff not working.
2010-03-11T05:01:00.000Z	IdleOne	chelz	if you don't need to upgrade then don't :)
2010-03-11T05:02:00.000Z	chelz	IdleOne	welll a lot of things i've looked over wanting to do require newer stuff. i tried to install some haskell stuff recently and wound up upgrading libc and had to spend a day uninstalling and reinstalling packages until things were right again. upgrading would probably be good for me.
2010-04-07T07:28:00.000Z	chelz	IdleOne	he is talking about ubuntu in a vm
