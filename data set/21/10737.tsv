2004-12-02T08:42:00.000Z	ophie		i have a question about setting up and using ad-hoc wireless networks...
2004-12-02T08:43:00.000Z	ophie		is there an easy way to use a wireless network discovered by "iwlist ath0 scan"
2004-12-02T08:45:00.000Z	ophie		i know you can set up profiles in /etc/network/interfaces, but i was looking more for a way to join a wireless network just as i'm running around
2004-12-02T08:46:00.000Z	potato	ophie	you could grep the iwlist output and join the essid
2004-12-02T08:47:00.000Z	ophie	potato	so would i just enter "iwconfig ath0 essid linksys" for example?
2004-12-02T08:47:00.000Z	ophie	potato	then how would i start the interface?  using "ifup ath0" uses the /etc/network/interfaces file
2004-12-02T08:51:00.000Z	ophie	potato	once i use "iwconfig ath0 essid linksys" for example, how do i start the interface?
2004-12-02T08:51:00.000Z	potato	ophie	I don't want to tell you non-ubuntu stuff
2004-12-02T08:53:00.000Z	ophie	potato	let me try your idea, thanks
2004-12-02T08:53:00.000Z	potato	ophie	better listen to this folks
2004-12-02T08:56:00.000Z	ophie	potato	this didn't work... "sudo iwconfig ath0 essid Maicubic ap 00:0C:41:76:9F:6E IP up"
2004-12-02T08:56:00.000Z	potato	ophie	don't bother with the ap
2004-12-02T08:57:00.000Z	ophie	potato	it gave me the error "Error : unrecognised wireless request "up""
2004-12-02T08:59:00.000Z	ophie	potato	so the question is, how do you start a wireless network without using "ifup"?
2004-12-02T09:00:00.000Z	ophie	potato	do i have to specify an IP?  or can i just use DHCP?
2004-12-02T09:00:00.000Z	potato	ophie	you don't know if that network has a dhcp server
2004-12-02T09:00:00.000Z	ophie	potato	so i should guess an IP address, huh?
2004-12-02T09:01:00.000Z	potato	ophie	it's your choice
2004-12-02T09:02:00.000Z	ophie	potato	thanks, let me try this out.  brb
2004-12-02T10:24:00.000Z	ophie	potato	then using "nmap -sP 192.168.0.*" only yields my own IP address being up...
2004-12-02T10:25:00.000Z	ophie	potato	but i'm still having trouble getting it to work.  i see that i am getting a signal % in the gnome wireless applet, but can't get an IP or connection
