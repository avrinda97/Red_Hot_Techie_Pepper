2005-04-23T08:08:00.000Z	nnonix		What kernel should I use with a P4 HT Processor? I can't find much on the web and what I have found conflicts.
2005-04-23T08:08:00.000Z	bob2	nnonix	686 or 386
2005-04-23T08:10:00.000Z	nnonix	bob2	I don't know, asking for a friend buying hardware ..... want to give the best advice I can.
2005-04-23T08:11:00.000Z	bob2	nnonix	that was me saying "either will work fine"
2005-04-23T08:12:00.000Z	nnonix	bob2	sorry .... I'm reading you, Dr_ and 4 others who pm'd me
2005-10-26T13:37:00.000Z	bob2	nnonix	bind problems?
2005-10-26T13:40:00.000Z	nnonix	bob2	Network-Manager requires bind9 and so its installed and starts on boot as it should. However, Network-Manager also calls bind directly, giving you 2 bind processes that are obviously conflicting. A restart of the regular bind process resolves the problem .... but you must do that everytime the machine boots or no resolution.
2005-10-26T13:40:00.000Z	bob2	nnonix	I had no conflict
2005-10-26T13:41:00.000Z	nnonix	bob2	how many bind processes do you have running at the moment AND are you using 127.0.0.1 as your only name server in resolv.conf?
2005-10-26T13:45:00.000Z	bob2	nnonix	I have 3 named process running
2005-10-26T13:47:00.000Z	nnonix	bob2	and is 127.0.0.1 the only name server specified in resolve.conf? I ask because if you have an outside nameserver specified, you wouldn't notice this problem
2005-10-26T13:47:00.000Z	nnonix	bob2	excuse me, resolv.conf
2005-10-26T13:49:00.000Z	bob2	nnonix	127.0.0.1 is all that's in there
2005-10-26T13:50:00.000Z	nnonix	bob2	any ideas then? On boot, with Network-manager installed I get no resolution unless I restart bind (it times out). Without Network-Manager installed bind loads fine and resolution is good. All was installed via apt and bind and dhcbdb were installed as dependancies by apt.
2005-10-26T13:52:00.000Z	bob2	nnonix	disturbingly, mine seems to listen on all interfaces
2005-10-26T13:55:00.000Z	nnonix	bob2	is your resolution doggy or intermittant at all, anytime?
2005-10-26T13:56:00.000Z	bob2	nnonix	no
2005-10-26T13:57:00.000Z	nnonix	bob2	are you running Breezy?
2005-10-26T13:57:00.000Z	bob2	nnonix	yes
2005-10-26T13:57:00.000Z	nnonix	bob2	JK ..... I guess your one of the lucky ones. Syruss and I are having the same problem.
2005-10-26T14:00:00.000Z	bob2	nnonix	not unless they're hallucinogenic
