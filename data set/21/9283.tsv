2006-12-01T17:46:00.000Z	Madeye		I'm not able to play any DVD on Edgy totem says 'please check that a disc is presence in the drive'    While same disc work on windows just fine
2006-12-01T17:48:00.000Z	Madeye		any idea?
2006-12-01T17:49:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Madeye	You've already done the dvd stuff from !restricted?  Do regular CDs work in the drive?
2006-12-01T17:49:00.000Z	Madeye	tonyyarusso	yes, actually this problem happens only with DVDs
2006-12-01T17:50:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Madeye	Is your region set correctly?
2006-12-01T17:51:00.000Z	Madeye	tonyyarusso	In my country everything is multi regional; anyway things was working just great with dapper 'same drive and same DVD movies'
2006-12-01T17:52:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Madeye	Ah, this is a change after Edgy upgrade?
2006-12-01T17:52:00.000Z	Madeye	tonyyarusso	yes
2006-12-01T17:54:00.000Z	Madeye	tonyyarusso	actually things were much better with dapper I'm considering downgrade
2006-12-01T17:54:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Madeye	In that case, we're dealing with a "something that shouldn't happen" rather than a "something that hasn't been configured right", so I'm going to recommend searching the Ubuntu Forums and Google to see if anyone has had the same issue (and hopefully has a fix) first.  Unless you've done that already?
2006-12-01T17:54:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Madeye	Also, did you ever use tools such as automatix or easyubuntu prior to upgrading?
2006-12-01T17:55:00.000Z	Madeye	tonyyarusso	I used automatix right after the fresh install of edgy
2006-12-01T17:55:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Madeye	Ah.  That would be an issue.
2006-12-01T17:56:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Madeye	Automatix is known to break stuff frequently.
2006-12-01T17:56:00.000Z	Madeye	tonyyarusso	darn, any way to roll things back
2006-12-01T17:56:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Madeye	Unfortunately, I don't know how to recover from it - there are some folks who can, but it's tricky.  It would probably be less bother to reinstall if that is an option for you.
2006-12-01T17:57:00.000Z	Madeye	tonyyarusso	but as a last resort I might
2006-12-01T17:57:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Madeye	Understandable.
2006-12-01T17:58:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Madeye	If you can catch one of the precious few that have experience solving that sort of thing, perhaps you'll get lucky.
2006-12-01T17:58:00.000Z	Madeye	tonyyarusso	I hope so
2006-12-01T17:58:00.000Z	Madeye	tonyyarusso	Thank you for helping and thank you for your time :-)
