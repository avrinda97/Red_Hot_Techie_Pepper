2011-10-19T03:22:00.000Z	erase		does anyone know if the problem that made 11.04 not to work on HP laptops, has been fixed in 11.10 ?
2011-10-19T03:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	erase	can you expand on "not work"
2011-10-19T03:24:00.000Z	erase	ActionParsnip	installation goes fine, but then it doesn't boot.
2011-10-19T03:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	erase	which GPU?
2011-10-19T03:24:00.000Z	erase	ActionParsnip	ati and intel
2011-10-19T03:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	erase	oh, one of those dual 'hybrid' gpu things?
2011-10-19T03:26:00.000Z	erase	ActionParsnip	unfortunately yes
2011-10-19T03:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	erase	those things are a massive pain, and not unique to HPs
2011-10-19T03:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	erase	your question should have been "Do hybrid video chips work yet in ubuntu"
2011-10-19T03:28:00.000Z	erase	ActionParsnip	previous 10.10 runs fine... what's your take on 11.10? should i try it?
2011-10-19T03:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	erase	if it ain't broke don't fix it
2011-10-19T03:32:00.000Z	erase	ActionParsnip	i just want to try unity. thanks for your attention! :D
2011-10-19T03:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	erase	could try a VM, or use a live USB
2011-10-19T03:34:00.000Z	erase	ActionParsnip	will do. thanks for the help
2011-11-04T09:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	erase	if you boot to live CD you can chmod it there
2011-11-04T09:40:00.000Z	erase	ActionParsnip	i can't reboot
2011-11-04T09:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	erase	why not?
2011-11-04T09:41:00.000Z	erase	ActionParsnip	it's a server.
2011-11-04T09:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	erase	then you qwill need to plan a maintenance window to do it. You could use sshfs and then access it from another system at cli and chmod it there. You may be able to also reinstall the package which chmod is part of
2011-11-04T09:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	erase	nice
2011-11-04T09:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	erase	you can but its not advised nor supported. You'll more than likely end up with a big mess
