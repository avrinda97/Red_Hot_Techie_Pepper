2006-10-31T13:26:00.000Z	troopa		Has anyone else got the error in 6.10 while trying to install where X fails and just says "no screens found".
2006-10-31T13:26:00.000Z	troopa		It looks like a bunch of directories are missing.
2006-10-31T13:26:00.000Z	troopa		I can't acces anything.
2006-10-31T13:27:00.000Z	troopa		I am trying to install Ubuntu when this happens.
2006-10-31T13:27:00.000Z	troopa		It happens shortly after selecting the first option in the boot menu after I boot from the CD.
2006-10-31T13:27:00.000Z	towsonu2003	troopa	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop might fix the issue
2006-10-31T13:28:00.000Z	towsonu2003	troopa	once X spits you out, it should throw you to a terminal. but you can also hit alt+ctrl+f1 and login there
2006-10-31T13:31:00.000Z	towsonu2003	troopa	the livecd also have the alt+ctrl+f1 thing like an installed system
2006-10-31T13:32:00.000Z	towsonu2003	troopa	but in the liveCD, as long as you are sure the CD is not corrupt, issue sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and choose vesa when it asks you to choose a driver. then I think startx should start X for you. have a look at the bug link Lynoure sent above though.
2006-10-31T13:39:00.000Z	towsonu2003	troopa	no, you can either modify the xorg.conf of the liveCD sesiion while it's runing, or that of your installed system...
2006-10-31T13:40:00.000Z	towsonu2003	troopa	what exactly happens when you hit ctrl+alt+f1 after X failed to start?
2006-10-31T13:42:00.000Z	towsonu2003	troopa	yes, the liveCD acts like an installed ubuntu system
2006-10-31T13:42:00.000Z	towsonu2003	troopa	pls type my whole nick, that's how your mesages get flagged for me to see easier
2006-10-31T13:43:00.000Z	towsonu2003	troopa	I'm a little confused... which cd are you trying to use to install?
2006-10-31T13:44:00.000Z	towsonu2003	troopa	desktop cd is the same as a liveCD
2006-10-31T13:45:00.000Z	towsonu2003	troopa	yes
2006-10-31T13:45:00.000Z	towsonu2003	troopa	then login at the screen you are presented with and then type sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2006-10-31T13:46:00.000Z	towsonu2003	troopa	when it asks you to choose a driver, select vesa
2006-10-31T13:46:00.000Z	towsonu2003	troopa	when all is done, restart x with the command startx
2006-10-31T13:46:00.000Z	towsonu2003	troopa	this should fix the liveCD. once the system installs, you may have to do the same thing after booting to your *installed* system -done -hope this helps
2006-10-31T13:47:00.000Z	towsonu2003	troopa	you're most welcome, hope it fixes the issue -don't forget to check the bug report link someone posted a little above
