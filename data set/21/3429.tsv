2009-01-02T15:07:00.000Z	Accidus		I'm having problems with my connection. Under Vista, everything seems to work fine. Under Ubuntu (8.10), normal surfing works fine, but when I try to do interactive stuff (gmail, facebook, banking, posting forum messages) things don't work properly. It takes ages to submit form and then nothing happens, etc. I've talked to my ISP and he said they're not doing anything special and that if it works under Vista it should work on Ubuntu. So what
2009-01-02T15:07:00.000Z	Accidus		can be the problem?
