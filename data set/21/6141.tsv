2007-07-10T05:27:00.000Z	merzbow		hello ... I'm trying to install WoW ... I mounted each .iso to a different folder ... for example /1 /2 /3 and /4 .. I run install in /1 and when it says please insert disc 2 I can't do anything ... i click ok and nothing happens ...  any ideas?
2007-07-10T05:28:00.000Z	HaSH	merzbow	use the same directory
2007-07-10T05:28:00.000Z	HaSH		just mount over the iso
2007-07-10T05:28:00.000Z	HaSH		is if you start in /1 mount the 2nd cd to /1 when it asks for the 2nd cd
2007-07-10T05:28:00.000Z	merzbow	HaSH	you mean ... mount all the discs in the same directory ...?
2007-07-10T05:29:00.000Z	HaSH	merzbow	yes. but not all at once.
2007-07-10T05:29:00.000Z	HaSH	merzbow	mount them ask the installer asks for them
2007-07-10T05:29:00.000Z	merzbow	HaSH	yeah I tried that ... but when I clicked ok .. nothing happened
2007-07-10T05:30:00.000Z	merzbow	HaSH	I'm using some program to mount them..
2007-07-10T05:30:00.000Z	HaSH		!iso | merzbow
2007-07-10T05:30:00.000Z	HaSH	merzbow	try to do it that^^ way
2007-07-10T05:31:00.000Z	merzbow	HaSH	I tried ... the thing is .. it wouldn't let me .. because of the filename  I think .. it was too long .. "World of Warcraft (Disc 1).iso"
2007-07-10T05:32:00.000Z	HaSH	merzbow	its the spaces in the name
2007-07-10T05:32:00.000Z	HaSH	merzbow	use tab auto complete
2007-07-10T05:32:00.000Z	HaSH		like mount .... /full/path/to/fi<tab>
2007-07-10T05:32:00.000Z	HaSH		and tab will auto fill it in....
2007-07-10T05:33:00.000Z	merzbow	HaSH	yeap I know ... though there are 4 files named very similar .. the only difference is the disc number ...
2007-07-10T05:33:00.000Z	HaSH	merzbow	hmm not sure then...
2007-07-10T05:34:00.000Z	merzbow	HaSH	although I didn't put the full path
2007-07-10T05:38:00.000Z	merzbow	HaSH	I went to the directory where the file is .. then I wrote the filename..
2007-07-10T05:38:00.000Z	HaSH	merzbow	....its worth a shot.
