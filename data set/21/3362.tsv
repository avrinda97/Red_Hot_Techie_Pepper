2009-01-19T07:38:00.000Z	marine		does anyone here know how to merge an unallocated partition
2009-01-19T07:39:00.000Z	dean	marine	use gparted to expand the partiton
2009-01-19T07:40:00.000Z	marine	dean	i used gparted to free up the remaining hardrive space from the windows side and got an unallocated partition
2009-01-19T07:43:00.000Z	dean	marine	you can't resize a partition while you're using it
2009-01-19T07:43:00.000Z	dean	marine	you'll have to boot from the live cd
2009-01-19T07:44:00.000Z	marine	dean	it won't give me that option
2009-01-19T07:44:00.000Z	dean	marine	are you in the live CD or booting from hard drive
2009-01-19T07:44:00.000Z	marine	dean	 and do what
2009-01-19T07:44:00.000Z	marine	dean	booting form the hard drive
2009-01-19T07:45:00.000Z	dean	marine	open gparted from the live cd
2009-01-19T07:45:00.000Z	dean	marine	instead of from the hard drive
2009-01-19T07:45:00.000Z	dean	marine	since ubuntu is using the partition, you cannot access it
2009-01-19T07:45:00.000Z	dean	marine	it has a lock next to it, right
2009-01-19T07:45:00.000Z	dean	marine	post a screenshot

2009-01-19T07:53:00.000Z	marine	dean	 i don't want to lose the info i have so far
