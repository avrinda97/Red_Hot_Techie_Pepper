2008-03-23T23:02:00.000Z	rahmen		I need help to get direct rendering working: http://pastebin.com/m1cb17a70
2008-03-23T23:04:00.000Z	nikrud	rahmen	have you tried installing any drivers for your card yet?
2008-03-23T23:04:00.000Z	rahmen	nikrud	I've tried lots of things :] ppl say System -> Admin -> RDM should work but it doesn't for me =/
2008-03-23T23:06:00.000Z	nikrud	rahmen	hm. rdm select ati driver, reboot, run fglrxinfo , make sure it's using ati 8.37.6 driver, install xserver-xgl compizconfig-settings-manager , log out and in, go to sys->prefs->appearance, effects tab. Works
2008-03-23T23:23:00.000Z	nikrud	rahmen	that was me. It's possible you have cruft left over from trying the ati installer from the website?
2008-03-23T23:24:00.000Z	rahmen	nikrud	yeah I guess so.. I've followed a few guides.. how do I get rid of it?
2008-03-23T23:24:00.000Z	nikrud	rahmen	not really. That installer has caused many people a lot of greif.
2008-03-23T23:25:00.000Z	rahmen	nikrud	but I theoretically could format the drive again? :P
2008-03-23T23:25:00.000Z	rahmen	nikrud	I just installed it so wouldn't cause that much problem
2008-03-23T23:25:00.000Z	nikrud	rahmen	so, you get an idea of what I think of the idea of reinstalling :)
2008-03-23T23:27:00.000Z	rahmen	nikrud	so I should reinstall ubuntu?
2008-03-23T23:27:00.000Z	rahmen	nikrud	I didn't get that last sentence of yours... :]
2008-03-23T23:28:00.000Z	nikrud	rahmen	it was a joke based on the clone advice I'd just given you, about a quick way to install the packages you already have :)
2008-03-23T23:28:00.000Z	rahmen	nikrud	didn't understand that last sentence*
2008-03-23T23:29:00.000Z	rahmen	nikrud	^^
2008-03-23T23:32:00.000Z	rahmen	nikrud	oh.. nice feature :] but I've just installed xchat-gnome and kopete :P
2008-03-23T23:33:00.000Z	nikrud	rahmen	eeww, xchat-gnome . Get a real client, install   xchat  . And whatever anyone says, stay away from irssi :)
2008-03-23T23:33:00.000Z	rahmen	nikrud	so your advice is to reinstall and then ask you for further commands? :P
2008-03-23T23:34:00.000Z	nikrud	rahmen	 write this down:  system->admin->restricted driver , enable ati restricted. reboot. log in, run fglrxinfo and make sure it's using ati 8.37.6 driver. install xserver-xgl compizconfig-settings-manager , then log out and back in. Go to system->prefs->appearance effect
2008-03-23T23:34:00.000Z	rahmen	nikrud	I'll try xchat next time :] I'm kind of searching for good programs.. I use pidgin on my laptop..
2008-03-23T23:37:00.000Z	rahmen	nikrud	oki.. I'll get back in here when I'm done.. :] thnx for the help.. hope it works :]
