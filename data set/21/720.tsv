2011-07-14T20:58:00.000Z	Starman83		Does anybody know why my usb stick won't show up on my desktop? (Using LXDE and Ubuntu 10.04 Server) I can't mount the device fine manually, but I'd like this to be automated...
2011-07-14T20:59:00.000Z	Starman83		*I can mount the device
2011-07-14T21:00:00.000Z	Incarus6	Starman83	can you unplug and plug your usb-stick again and type "dmesg" in the terminal?
2011-07-14T21:00:00.000Z	Starman83	Incarus6	wait a sec
2011-07-14T21:02:00.000Z	Starman83	Incarus6	I have attached my usb disk (which shows the same behavior, lack of icons on LXDE desktop): http://pastebin.com/iEWnWmzk
2011-07-14T21:05:00.000Z	Starman83	Incarus6	Any ideas?
2011-07-14T21:06:00.000Z	Incarus6	Starman83	what file system got your usb stick?
2011-07-14T21:06:00.000Z	Starman83	Incarus6	NTFS
2011-07-14T21:07:00.000Z	Starman83	Incarus6	: My usb stick uses FAT32, same issue there
2011-07-14T21:08:00.000Z	Starman83		I believe I lack the proper triggers to make the system mount the device automatically and put an icon on desktop. Maybe it's because I installed from a minimal system?
2011-07-14T21:08:00.000Z	Incarus6	Starman83	is "/etc/auto.master" configured properly?
2011-07-14T21:09:00.000Z	Starman83		There is no /etc/auto.master file
2011-07-14T21:10:00.000Z	Starman83		There is no autofs or automount installed
2011-07-14T21:10:00.000Z	Incarus6	Starman83	is automounting working with other usb sticks?
2011-07-14T21:10:00.000Z	Starman83		Nope
2011-07-14T21:10:00.000Z	Starman83		Not even with cdrom i guess :)
2011-07-14T21:11:00.000Z	Incarus6	Starman83	you could try usbmount http://usbmount.alioth.debian.org/
2011-07-14T21:11:00.000Z	Incarus6		!info usbmount
2011-07-14T21:12:00.000Z	Starman83		Should I just install this?
2011-07-14T21:12:00.000Z	Starman83		What is the package that gets installed with a normal desktop ubuntu system?
2011-07-14T21:14:00.000Z	Incarus6	Starman83	the package is in the repo http://packages.ubuntu.com/natty/usbmount
