2009-01-07T22:15:00.000Z	omnydevi	gasto	- did you install envyng?
2009-01-07T22:15:00.000Z	gasto		I want to know how to get my Ubuntu working with Nvidia graphics,
2009-01-07T22:16:00.000Z	gasto		and want to know how to diagnose or get the file log of what is going on with the video
2009-01-07T22:16:00.000Z	omnydevi	gasto	- did you install envyng ?
2009-01-07T22:18:00.000Z	gasto		omnydevi
2009-01-07T22:18:00.000Z	gasto		yes
2009-01-07T22:19:00.000Z	gasto		Omnydevi, I installed envy and gave me same results as attempt of direct install of Nvidia drivers
2009-01-07T22:19:00.000Z	gasto		could it be because I did nothing about the previously installed drivers from Nvidia?
2009-01-07T22:20:00.000Z	omnydevi	gasto	- you installed envy or envyng?
2009-01-07T22:20:00.000Z	gasto		both
2009-01-07T22:20:00.000Z	gasto		I think
2009-01-07T22:20:00.000Z	omnydevi	gasto	- yes it could
2009-01-07T22:20:00.000Z	gasto		one is for gui, other is core right?
2009-01-07T22:21:00.000Z	omnydevi	gasto	- install envyng, then from terminal run envyng -t, then 0 to uninstall, then when it comes back up, use envyng -t then 1 to install then reboot
2009-01-07T22:21:00.000Z	omnydevi	gasto	- after the uninstall, reboot the machine
2009-01-07T22:21:00.000Z	gasto	omnydevi	OK I will update when that happens
2009-01-07T22:22:00.000Z	omnydevi	gasto	- also, if it lists more than 1 driver you can install, install the recommended one. even if it isnt the latest. like mine, i have 173 installed, even though 177 is available
