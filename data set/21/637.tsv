2011-08-17T15:30:00.000Z	cook1es		hello what is the easiest way to change username of my administrator account?
2011-08-17T15:30:00.000Z	dr_willis	cook1es	 make a new user with the same rights..
2011-08-17T15:32:00.000Z	cook1es	dr_willis	will my settings transfer aswell then?
2011-08-17T15:32:00.000Z	dr_willis	cook1es	 no..  but you could copy them over and chown/chmod them to be owned by the new user..
2011-08-17T15:33:00.000Z	cook1es	dr_willis	ok copying will not be a problem, how do I chown something?
2011-08-17T15:34:00.000Z	dr_willis	cook1es	 with the chown command
2011-08-17T15:34:00.000Z	cook1es	dr_willis	thanks
2011-08-17T15:35:00.000Z	dr_willis	cook1es	 why are you changing the  admin users name anyway?
2011-08-17T15:36:00.000Z	cook1es	dr_willis	I am uncomfortable with my current adminusername, its a VM so no sour business going on :-)
2011-08-17T15:37:00.000Z	cook1es	dr_willis	no, I just don't want all to know my real name when I pastebin my sudo commands and I am too lazy to erase it manually
2011-08-17T15:38:00.000Z	dr_willis	cook1es	  you could just do a sudo -i
2011-08-17T15:39:00.000Z	cook1es	dr_willis	excellent I will knock that into my head, is it also possible to change the "computer name" which is after the @
2011-08-17T15:41:00.000Z	dr_willis	cook1es	 thats the hostname. yes  its changeble
2011-08-17T15:42:00.000Z	cook1es	dr_willis	cool
2011-08-17T15:42:00.000Z	dr_willis	cook1es	 you could just change your bash prompt  ... and not alter either of those.. :)
2011-08-17T15:43:00.000Z	cook1es	dr_willis	how would one do that?
2011-08-17T15:56:00.000Z	dr_willis	cook1es	 bash basics check out the 'bash prompt howto' you just set your PS1 variable. :)
2011-08-17T16:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	cook1es	 your admin user techinally does have 'root' access...  clarify what you are wanting to do exactly..
2011-08-17T16:08:00.000Z	cook1es	dr_willis	I want to open geany and be able to edit /etc/ files without having to sudo geany
2011-08-17T16:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	cook1es	 i suggest you learn the proper methods and practice good security habbits...
2011-08-17T16:11:00.000Z	dr_willis	cook1es	 there are some addons/scripts for nautilys that let you right click and 'edit as root....'   it then just asks for the password and you are set..
