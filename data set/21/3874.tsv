2008-10-04T21:21:00.000Z	johnfg		Do I have to reboot to see them?
2008-10-04T21:21:00.000Z	outbackwifi	johnfg	showing up where?
2008-10-04T21:22:00.000Z	johnfg	outbackwifi	Ali_ix: from one of the menus in gnome, like what I'm used to.
2008-10-04T21:22:00.000Z	outbackwifi	johnfg	welcome to linux, nothing shows upp, just works well

2008-10-04T21:24:00.000Z	outbackwifi	johnfg	service is in redhat/fedora
2008-10-04T21:24:00.000Z	johnfg	outbackwifi	So, how do I start nfs?
2008-10-04T21:24:00.000Z	outbackwifi	johnfg	in debian based distros you use /etc/init.d/daemonname
2008-10-04T21:25:00.000Z	johnfg	outbackwifi	You answered before I even asked!  What a guy!
2008-10-04T21:27:00.000Z	outbackwifi	johnfg	nfs != samba
2008-10-04T21:28:00.000Z	johnfg	outbackwifi	Of course, but I'm just saying that the nfs option for sharing didn't show up.
2008-10-04T21:30:00.000Z	outbackwifi	johnfg	what packages did you install?
2008-10-04T21:31:00.000Z	johnfg	outbackwifi	Just a sec and I'll tell ya.
2008-10-04T21:33:00.000Z	outbackwifi	johnfg	great
2008-10-04T21:36:00.000Z	outbackwifi	johnfg	do you want to connect to other nfs shares or expose your dirs as nfs shares
2008-10-04T21:37:00.000Z	johnfg	outbackwifi	Yes!  Actually both!  But first, and sooner, expose my dirs as nfs shares.
2008-10-04T21:37:00.000Z	outbackwifi	johnfg	so  make appropriate entries in your fstab
