2005-07-02T16:00:00.000Z	ogge		how can I define /dev/hdc
2005-07-02T16:00:00.000Z	ogge		what is it?
2005-07-02T09:18:00.000Z	ogge		How do I know my ubuntu hoary with xorg and xfce4 uses all of my video memory. And that it is optimized.
2005-07-02T09:18:00.000Z	gm78	ogge	what kind of video card do u have?
2005-07-02T09:19:00.000Z	ogge	gm78	some kind of ATI card. Only 4Mbyte.
2005-07-02T09:20:00.000Z	gm78	ogge	4 MB card....I wouldn't worry about it being optimized.....won't do much good, I still get sluggish Windows sometimes on my 128 MB Nvidia card
2005-07-02T09:21:00.000Z	gm78	ogge	Ubuntu....or do u mean 3D software?
2005-07-02T09:24:00.000Z	gm78	ogge	never experienced that. it may be your graphics card though. My brother has a 4 MB Graphics card on Win2000 and its sluggish like that
2005-07-02T09:24:00.000Z	ogge	gm78	Ok.
2005-07-02T09:27:00.000Z	gm78	ogge	apt is a command line tool to install software. for instance, to install amsn, you would type in apt-get install amsn. Synaptic is just a gui for apt. sources.list lists the places where apt will search for packages
2005-07-02T09:28:00.000Z	gm78	ogge	apt/synaptic will download and install the packages for you
2005-07-02T09:31:00.000Z	gm78	ogge	well if they did ubuntu itself would most likely contain viruses, since they are run by the same people and contained on ubuntu's servers....i wouldnt worry too much about it
2005-07-02T09:32:00.000Z	gm78	ogge	in other words, dont run and add every repository you see on the net. mainly stick with the ubuntu ones....or ones from apt-get.org if you absolutely have to
2005-07-02T09:41:00.000Z	gm78	ogge	open the gnome system monitor
2005-07-02T09:42:00.000Z	ogge	gm78	wont start anyone if I type gnome-system-monitor in terminal.
2005-07-02T09:59:00.000Z	gm78	ogge	nope....icewm is actually really lightweight....also light in features tho
2005-07-02T09:59:00.000Z	gm78	ogge	a cool window manager to try is windowmaker
2005-07-02T10:00:00.000Z	ogge	gm78	ok. is it nice?
2005-07-02T10:00:00.000Z	gm78	ogge	sort of....it takes getting used to....its free so u may as well go ahead and download it :P
2005-07-02T10:03:00.000Z	gm78	ogge	most cheap on board video cards don't have their own RAM
2005-07-02T10:03:00.000Z	ogge	gm78	aight.
