2009-01-29T09:51:00.000Z	redvamp128	ubundude1	 are you using chatzilla -- thunderbird or fennec?
2009-01-29T09:52:00.000Z	redvamp128	ubundude1	 if you have for example I have heard of thunderbird people starting it to check the mail and it keeping firefox from starting.
2009-01-29T09:53:00.000Z	redvamp128	ubundude1	have you checked in the system monitor for firefox -- process there?
2009-01-29T09:54:00.000Z	redvamp128	ubundude1	 are you the only user on your computer( I know it sounds crazy but sometimes)-- you could try the following though not recomended -- sudo firefox -- let it open or fail then close it outl.
2009-01-29T09:55:00.000Z	redvamp128	ubundude1	 Also look for things like Thunderbird-- Fennec -- and MOZCHAT (chatzilla)
2009-01-29T09:59:00.000Z	redvamp128	ubundude1	 also look in the list for Minefield
2009-01-29T10:05:00.000Z	redvamp128	ubundude1	firefox -ProfileManager
2009-01-29T10:08:00.000Z	redvamp128	ubundude1	find your .mozilla folder and your profile and look for  .parentlock file and delete it
2009-01-29T10:09:00.000Z	redvamp128	ubundude1	did the firefox -Profilemanger work to open a new instance?
2009-01-29T10:10:00.000Z	redvamp128	ubundude1	 find your default profile and delete the following from that folder -- the "lock" and ".parentlock" file
2009-01-29T10:11:00.000Z	redvamp128	ubundude1	should be -- nautilus show all files -- then the .mozilla folder under your user name
2009-01-29T10:12:00.000Z	redvamp128	ubundude1	I got that one from this http://kb.mozillazine.org/Profile_in_use
2009-01-29T10:13:00.000Z	redvamp128	ubundude1	any luck after delete that file?
2009-01-29T10:18:00.000Z	redvamp128	ubundude1	-- most of what I have read in the kb at mozilla seems to say either a flash plugin or extended use or a bad close profile hangs it.
2009-01-29T10:22:00.000Z	redvamp128	ubundude1	any of these extension installed -- Cooliris?
2009-01-29T10:23:00.000Z	redvamp128	ubundude1	 rename it then reastart the stystem-- (shoudl firefox complain about no profile) just use the - firefox -profilemanger to make a new one
2009-01-29T10:24:00.000Z	redvamp128	ubundude1	every bug I have read about it says something in the profile has it locked-
2009-01-29T10:39:00.000Z	redvamp128	ubundude1	when you read things like these Bug 407981 â€“ Delayed shutdown makes it impossible to start Firefox immediately after exiting <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=407981>
2009-01-29T10:39:00.000Z	redvamp128	ubundude1	and that one was a light one-- you hear all kinds of things
2009-01-29T10:40:00.000Z	redvamp128	ubundude1	though sorry about you loosing your bookmarks and things -- but at least now firefox works
2009-01-29T10:43:00.000Z	redvamp128	ubundude1	though if you had saved a copy or had FEBE installed you could get those back.
