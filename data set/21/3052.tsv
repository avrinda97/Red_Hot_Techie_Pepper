2009-04-18T11:57:00.000Z	bytejumper		It's is not true, I know may of them and all using Windows
2009-04-18T11:57:00.000Z	bytejumper		But nevermind, I'm using Linux for developing applications, it's a shame, but not music apps :)
2009-04-18T11:58:00.000Z	bytejumper		I hate Windows, only problem with this shitty software
2009-04-18T11:58:00.000Z	bytejumper		I'm using Linux since over 6 years and I very happy with it. The problem is my friend has installed ubuntu and byued a drum station
2009-04-18T11:59:00.000Z	armornick	bytejumper	you could try virtualbox
