2011-01-02T02:40:00.000Z	mongy	otterpat	seen that before... sadly.  sudo apt-get install --reinstall bcmwl-kernel-source  (with cable connected)
2011-01-02T02:41:00.000Z	mongy	otterpat	selecting download updates during install actually installs the driver so, before you go onto partitioning etc, you can connect via wifi, and its there after you install..
2011-01-02T02:41:00.000Z	mongy	otterpat	just a btw
2011-01-02T02:41:00.000Z	otterpat	mongy	Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?
2011-01-02T02:45:00.000Z	otterpat	mongy	ok reboot?
2011-01-02T02:45:00.000Z	mongy	otterpat	no need to..
2011-01-02T02:47:00.000Z	otterpat	mongy	additional drivers is grayed out
2011-01-02T02:48:00.000Z	mongy	otterpat	reboot or login/out if you think you need to.   lsmod | grep wl
2011-01-02T02:48:00.000Z	otterpat	mongy	ok
2011-01-02T02:59:00.000Z	otterpat	mongy	did not work
2011-01-02T02:59:00.000Z	mongy	otterpat	network manager not picked up any stations?
2011-01-02T03:09:00.000Z	mongy	otterpat	odd.  which broadcom is it
2011-01-02T03:03:00.000Z	otterpat	mongy	well let me rephrase my problem yes it connects but it disconnects
2011-01-02T03:04:00.000Z	mongy	otterpat	ah well,  was there the b43 driver available.. bu I use STA fine..
2011-01-02T03:06:00.000Z	otterpat	mongy	the STA did not work at all
2011-01-02T03:09:00.000Z	mongy	otterpat	lspci -v | grep Broadcom
2011-01-02T03:11:00.000Z	otterpat	mongy	the one that is not working is the STA and the one that is is the B43
2011-01-02T03:12:00.000Z	mongy	otterpat	its the opposite for me.  well as long as its working.
2011-01-02T03:14:00.000Z	otterpat	mongy	well working is a relative term still disconnecting
2011-01-02T03:20:00.000Z	otterpat	mongy	i wonder  if it is my wireless card itself i just created a wireless network and it has no signal strength but is is conned
2011-01-02T03:21:00.000Z	mongy	otterpat	for me b43 worked flaky, and signal was always very low, rate was fluctuating from 1mb/s to 54mbp/s all the time
