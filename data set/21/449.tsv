2011-12-10T19:01:00.000Z	fly80		hello
2011-12-10T19:03:00.000Z	fly80		i have installed ubuntu on an old laptop... I have now problems using the gdm with effects... afters seconds the display becomes black and I have to manually shutdown to restart...
2011-12-10T19:04:00.000Z	fly80		now i'm connected with the text-bsed interface
2011-12-10T19:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	fly80	what GPU do you use?
2011-12-10T19:05:00.000Z	fly80	ActionParsnip	the cpu is a centrino
2011-12-10T19:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	fly80	try the bootoption:  radeon.nomodeset=1
2011-12-10T19:06:00.000Z	fly80	ActionParsnip	at start I have no grub interface... how can I set it up?
2011-12-10T19:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	fly80	you can choose unity2D from the login screen
2011-12-10T19:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	fly80	hold shift at boot and you will see grub
2011-12-10T19:07:00.000Z	fly80	ActionParsnip	any other hints?
2011-12-10T19:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	fly80	the boot option may help, if you use the 2D it won't use 3D accelleration and may help while you get uppdated
2011-12-10T19:09:00.000Z	fly80	ActionParsnip	i'll reboot now. Thanks for now. If you see me again something goes wrong ;)
2011-12-11T19:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	fly80	is it teh touchpad or a USB mouse?
2011-12-11T19:46:00.000Z	fly80	ActionParsnip	it is an USB mouse, the touchpad is working
2011-12-11T19:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	fly80	do other USB devices work ok?
2011-12-11T19:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	fly80	hmm, are the ports enabled in BIOS?
2011-12-11T19:48:00.000Z	fly80	ActionParsnip	if it's not that... what can be?
2011-12-11T19:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	fly80	tried a different port?
2011-12-11T19:50:00.000Z	fly80	ActionParsnip	yes, i tried all ports
2011-12-11T19:51:00.000Z	fly80	ActionParsnip	i'll try to check on BIOS... maybe it's just that... i hope
2011-12-11T19:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	fly80	boot without the mouse inserted and log in as normal, then attach the device, wait a few seconds and run:  dmesg | tail; lsb_release -a       and pastebin the content please
