2006-10-08T08:10:00.000Z	avagant		I was trying to move a icon file from the desktop to the icon file and I think I accidently moved my whole entire desktop to the icon folder, what do I do?

2006-10-08T08:11:00.000Z	avagant		I'd really like some help with this, because I'm seriously going to cry. It's been the worst week of my life with this linux stuff.

2006-10-08T08:13:00.000Z	avagant		I was trying to move my icons from my desktop to the icon file.
2006-10-08T08:13:00.000Z	avagant		And I accidently moved the whole entire Desktop folder I think.
2006-10-08T08:13:00.000Z	avagant		I moved it back, but I'm not sure if it's screwed up now.
2006-10-08T08:13:00.000Z	avagant		Cause my hd isn't showing up in ls
2006-10-08T08:14:00.000Z	avagant		My second hd isn't showing up.
2006-10-08T08:14:00.000Z	avagant		Are you sure?
2006-10-08T08:14:00.000Z	avagant		I really hope so.
