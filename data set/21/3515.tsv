2009-12-16T11:56:00.000Z	ManDay		Why does network manager keep asking me to unlock the Keyring for it???
2009-12-16T11:56:00.000Z	airtonix	ManDay	because it is a system wide setting
2009-12-16T11:56:00.000Z	ManDay	airtonix	it should remember the authorization tho, airtonix
2009-12-16T11:57:00.000Z	airtonix	ManDay	why ?
2009-12-16T11:58:00.000Z	airtonix	ManDay	i don't use wireless networking out of concern for security and quality of network connection
2009-12-16T11:59:00.000Z	ManDay	airtonix	I do, because its indepensable
2009-12-16T12:03:00.000Z	ManDay	airtonix	to my knowledge there is no way of cracking WPA2 yet, besides you can always add another layer of encryption, if you deem it unsafe
2009-12-19T18:18:00.000Z	airtonix	ManDay	yes
2009-12-19T18:18:00.000Z	airtonix	ManDay	visually it looks the same as winamp 2.91 or xmms
2009-12-19T18:19:00.000Z	ManDay	airtonix	i c

2010-03-23T15:11:00.000Z	airtonix	ManDay	doesnt autocomplete in geany only work on symbols already in your current document ?
2010-03-23T15:12:00.000Z	ManDay	airtonix	that would be very unfortunate. are you sure it doesnt autocomplete for included headers??
2010-03-23T15:12:00.000Z	airtonix	ManDay	i can't be sure. but it was my assumption
2010-03-23T15:14:00.000Z	ManDay	airtonix	well it suggests "finite" which isnt in my document either
2010-03-23T15:16:00.000Z	airtonix	ManDay	http://www.geany.org/manual/current/index.html#autocompletion
2010-03-23T15:18:00.000Z	airtonix	ManDay	maybe there is a definition file somewhere that is used to generate the suggestions ?
2010-03-23T15:18:00.000Z	ManDay	airtonix	i just got word from #geany that geany doesnt do that
2010-05-02T14:57:00.000Z	airtonix	ManDay	it offends my therotical yet-to-be unborn chiuld.
