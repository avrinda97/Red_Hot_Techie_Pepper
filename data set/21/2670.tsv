2010-12-17T10:54:00.000Z	ribot	definity	no mouse?
2010-12-17T10:54:00.000Z	ribot	definity	you are learning in hardcore :)
2010-12-17T10:54:00.000Z	ribot	definity	not even ncurses then?
2010-12-17T10:55:00.000Z	ribot	definity	uhm well do you know the terminal program screen?
2010-12-17T10:58:00.000Z	ribot	definity	you didn't answer, but you can copy-paste in termanal by using "screen"... if you start screen and then sign on to irc from that command-line
2010-12-17T11:00:00.000Z	ribot	definity	using screen you can jump from different terminals without using any x
2010-12-17T11:01:00.000Z	ribot	definity	just write screen in commandline...then probably you have to press enter, and then sign on to irc from there, and come back here and i will tell you
2010-12-17T11:07:00.000Z	ribot	definity	what did not work?
2010-12-17T11:08:00.000Z	ribot	definity	it will not change your graphics, it will give you the possibility to copy-paste without graphics, and also you don't have to quit irc to try stuff
2010-12-17T11:08:00.000Z	ribot	definity	but you have to understand what you are supposed to do first
2010-12-17T11:09:00.000Z	ribot	definity	no, also you will be able to come back to the chat and see old messages
2010-12-17T11:10:00.000Z	ribot	definity	no
2010-12-17T11:10:00.000Z	ribot	definity	how do you start your irc client?
2010-12-17T11:12:00.000Z	ribot	definity	what you need to do is to start your irc client after you have started screen. To do that you have to do this, and read very carefully: after you exit here, type "screen" and press enter. After that, read the message if you get one and press enter. Then from there, type "epic5 -a irc.freenode.net"
2010-12-17T11:15:00.000Z	ribot	definity	if you came back here then maybe it did work
2010-12-17T11:15:00.000Z	ribot	definity	how can you say it didnt work when you dont know what will happen
2010-12-17T11:16:00.000Z	ribot	definity	yes but when you are inside screen you can do stuff
2010-12-17T11:18:00.000Z	ribot	definity	now you can open another terminal... you have to do two things: 1) press ctrl+a and then c (a new terminal will open) 2) press ctrl+a twice (you will come back here)
