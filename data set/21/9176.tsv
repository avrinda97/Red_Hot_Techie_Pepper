2006-03-21T09:34:00.000Z	jenda	_jason	OK thanks for that. It meantions using SCIM - how do I know if I use that?
2006-03-21T09:34:00.000Z	_jason	jenda	scim is for chinese input
2006-03-21T09:35:00.000Z	jenda	_jason	Oh OK, thanks
2006-03-28T08:44:00.000Z	_jason	jenda	you can set them in system > preferences > sounds > system events, do you really want the config file?
2006-03-28T08:45:00.000Z	jenda	_jason	yup. I already have them set on one PC and want the same on another.
2006-03-28T08:48:00.000Z	_jason	jenda	appears to be set in ~/.gnome2/sound/events/
2006-03-28T08:48:00.000Z	jenda	_jason	OK, thanks.
2006-03-28T09:19:00.000Z	_jason	jenda	it's always recursive.  If you mv a folder, its contents go with it
2006-03-28T09:19:00.000Z	jenda	_jason	OK, thanks
2006-03-28T09:23:00.000Z	jenda	_jason	how do I make mv rename a dir?
2006-03-28T09:24:00.000Z	_jason	jenda	mv olddirectory newdirectory
2006-03-28T09:24:00.000Z	jenda	_jason	that moves the old one into the new one.
2006-03-28T09:25:00.000Z	_jason	jenda	that's the same as renaming
2006-03-28T09:25:00.000Z	_jason	jenda	I think? let me try...
2006-03-28T09:25:00.000Z	_jason	jenda	works fine
2006-03-28T09:26:00.000Z	jenda	_jason	hmm... seems it does, but only after you remove the directory called <new>, ie. it won't overwrite.
2006-03-28T09:28:00.000Z	_jason	jenda	that's correct
2006-03-28T12:05:00.000Z	_jason	jenda	juggly them would be amazing
2006-03-28T12:05:00.000Z	_jason	jenda	s/juggly/juggling
2006-03-28T12:06:00.000Z	jenda	_jason	Aughta try that... damn, dropped my laptop on top of my desktop ... (too many tops)
