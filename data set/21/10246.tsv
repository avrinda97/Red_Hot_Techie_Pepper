2005-05-05T09:19:00.000Z	dcraven		Is that right?
2005-05-05T09:20:00.000Z	dcraven		Close?
2005-05-05T09:20:00.000Z	dcraven		:)
2005-05-05T09:21:00.000Z	dcraven		I wish I was bilingual.
2005-05-05T09:23:00.000Z	Ironfrost	dcraven	http://ubuntuguide.org isn't working for me
2005-05-05T09:52:00.000Z	dcraven	Ironfrost	there is a wiki page that has what you are talking about too I think --> https://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/FixVideoResolutionHowto
2005-05-08T08:52:00.000Z	dcraven	Ironfrost	try "sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libmp3lame.so.0.0.0 /usr/lib/libmp3lame.so"
2005-05-08T08:53:00.000Z	dcraven	Ironfrost	that'll make a symlink with the filename you are expecting. This assumes that the file libmp3lame.so.0.0.0 exists on your machine.
2005-05-08T08:54:00.000Z	Ironfrost	dcraven	- /usr/lib/libmp3lame.so.0.0.0 does not exist either
2005-05-08T08:55:00.000Z	dcraven	Ironfrost	is there a /usr/lib/libmp3lame.so.0? Or some variation? ehe
2005-05-08T08:55:00.000Z	dcraven	Ironfrost	oh my.
2005-05-08T08:55:00.000Z	dcraven	Ironfrost	I wonder where I got mine.. hmmm
2005-05-08T08:55:00.000Z	dcraven	Ironfrost	mine came with the liblame0 package.
2005-05-08T08:56:00.000Z	dcraven	Ironfrost	do you have liblame0 isntalled?
2005-05-08T08:56:00.000Z	dcraven	Ironfrost	okay
2005-05-08T08:56:00.000Z	dcraven	Ironfrost	I think it's in multiverse.
2005-05-08T08:57:00.000Z	dcraven	Ironfrost	you *may* still need the symlink.. Depends on how picky Audacity is.
2005-05-08T08:57:00.000Z	dcraven	Ironfrost	it'll work though.
2005-05-08T08:57:00.000Z	dcraven	Ironfrost	Don't thank me until it actually does work :)
2005-05-08T08:59:00.000Z	dcraven	Ironfrost	cool. You're welcom.
