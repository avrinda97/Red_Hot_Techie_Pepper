2009-11-06T13:23:00.000Z	toddler		I installed Ubuntu 9.10 Netbook Remix on my asus eee 900 yesterday, and it works fine except the connection speed on my home network seems to be mortally slow. Any idea why? (repeated question, sorry)
2009-11-06T13:23:00.000Z	icarus-c	toddler	can you make sure it is not a network or bandwidth issue?
2009-11-06T13:24:00.000Z	toddler	icarus-c	my gf's computer with vista handles the network perfectly
2009-11-06T13:24:00.000Z	icarus-c	toddler	what is your wireless chip
2009-11-06T13:25:00.000Z	toddler	icarus-c	what do I type to find out?
2009-11-06T13:25:00.000Z	icarus-c	toddler	lspci -v
2009-11-06T13:25:00.000Z	icarus-c	toddler	or  lsusb  for usb wireless device
2009-11-06T13:27:00.000Z	toddler	icarus-c	Atheros AR5001
2009-11-06T13:28:00.000Z	icarus-c	toddler	it worked out of the box without manually installing any driver right?
2009-11-06T13:29:00.000Z	toddler	icarus-c	yes, and it works flawlessly on my uni's network
2009-11-06T13:30:00.000Z	icarus-c	toddler	in the lspci -v output, what is the driver in use?
2009-11-06T13:30:00.000Z	toddler	icarus-c	ath5k
2009-11-06T13:31:00.000Z	icarus-c	toddler	um...  try sudo modprobe ath9k
2009-11-06T13:32:00.000Z	toddler	icarus-c	no response
2009-11-06T13:32:00.000Z	toddler	icarus-c	I just got the prompt back immediately
2009-11-06T13:32:00.000Z	icarus-c	toddler	now lspci -v  again
2009-11-06T13:33:00.000Z	toddler	icarus-c	exactly same output as before
2009-11-06T13:35:00.000Z	icarus-c	toddler	a google on  AR5001 linux performance  give me this http://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=60759
2009-11-06T13:38:00.000Z	toddler	icarus-c	doesn't really help, though. I have the latest kernel, and the modprobe for ath9k didn't do anything.
2009-11-06T13:40:00.000Z	icarus-c	toddler	no clue
2009-11-06T13:41:00.000Z	toddler	icarus-c	thanks anyway
