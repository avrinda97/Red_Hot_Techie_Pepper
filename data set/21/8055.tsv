2007-01-29T11:50:00.000Z	webben		Does anyone know how to get Focus to work in a vaguely consistent manner, such that, for example, you can open gvim and click inside another window, and thus both activate that window and bring it to the forefront.
2007-01-29T11:52:00.000Z	soundray	webben	want you want is called click-to-focus and autoraise in the unix world :)
2007-01-29T11:53:00.000Z	webben	soundray	Then why does it work like that sometimes and not other times.
2007-01-29T11:53:00.000Z	soundray	webben	are you on gnome?
2007-01-29T11:54:00.000Z	webben	soundray	yeah
2007-01-29T11:54:00.000Z	webben	soundray	switching between metacity and beryl depending on how infuriated I get
2007-01-29T11:55:00.000Z	soundray	webben	oh, if you're switching between wm's I don't know how you'd get it to be consistent.
2007-01-29T11:55:00.000Z	webben	soundray	not consistent /between/ wm's
2007-01-29T11:55:00.000Z	soundray	webben	why not configure different users for different wms?
2007-01-29T11:56:00.000Z	webben	soundray	Sorry I'm not being clear. I'll use either wm. So long as it is consistent with itself.
2007-01-29T11:56:00.000Z	webben	soundray	see this http://gnomesupport.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=12034 bug
2007-01-29T11:57:00.000Z	soundray	webben	sry, you are clearly better informed than I am... Have you considered using focus-follows-mouse & no autoraise and just getting used to it? It has many advantages for power users...
2007-01-29T11:58:00.000Z	webben	soundray	I did experiment with that. It drove to me to distraction to be honest. ;)
2007-01-29T11:59:00.000Z	webben	soundray	but thanks for the suggestion :)
2007-01-29T11:59:00.000Z	soundray	webben	yw ;)  Next time I'll try and be a real help.
2007-01-30T08:28:00.000Z	soundray	webben	try 'sudo dpkg --configure -a'
2007-01-30T08:29:00.000Z	webben	soundray	thanks that gives me the same error
2007-01-30T08:31:00.000Z	soundray	webben	can you install dictionaries-common ?
2007-01-30T08:32:00.000Z	soundray	webben	(it provides /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/dictionaries-common/debian-ispell.el)
2007-01-30T08:59:00.000Z	webben	soundray	thanks... I'm still getting the same error unfortunately.
2007-01-30T09:00:00.000Z	soundray	webben	you may have to install the dictionaries with dpkg -force... -i /var/cache/apt/archives/dictionaries-common_*.deb (look at man dpkg to determine the correct force option)
