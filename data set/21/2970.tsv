2009-12-09T02:51:00.000Z	Pudgy		Is there an Ubuntu packager online by any chance for a question?
2009-12-09T02:52:00.000Z	maco	Pudgy	are you looking to get involved with packaging?
2009-12-09T02:52:00.000Z	maco	Pudgy	if so, #ubuntu-motu is the place to go
2009-12-09T02:53:00.000Z	maco	Pudgy	but whats up? i might be able to answer your question
2009-12-09T02:53:00.000Z	Pudgy	maco	Ah, I would, but that's not the question ;) But I guess ub-motu is the place to go
2009-12-09T02:53:00.000Z	maco	Pudgy	well i do some packaging, so if you'd like i can try to answer
2009-12-09T02:55:00.000Z	Pudgy	maco	I would like to have an ubuntu package for (suckless's) surf tar.gz. I would like to give it a go myself, but that would take ages to learn. Is there a way to propose that tar.gz to be packaged?
2009-12-09T02:55:00.000Z	maco	Pudgy	yep, you can file a bug
2009-12-09T02:56:00.000Z	maco	Pudgy	and it doesnt take ages :) its not too bad really, though that kinda depends on how complicated the software you're packaging is
2009-12-09T02:56:00.000Z	Pudgy	maco	I can't even solve the dependancies by hand installing tarballs ;) (yes I tried)
2009-12-09T02:57:00.000Z	maco	Pudgy	the INSTALL file should help if there is one. also, "apt-file search $filename" (apt-file is not installed by default) can lookup what package contains the file you're missing for compiling against
2009-12-09T02:58:00.000Z	Pudgy	maco	damn... now you make me anxious to try again...
2009-12-09T02:59:00.000Z	Pudgy	maco	I'll check out launchpad just to be on the safe side ;) Did you package a lot?
2009-12-09T03:00:00.000Z	maco	Pudgy	i dont often do packages from scratch. usually it's packaging a new release or integrating a patch into a package
2009-12-09T03:03:00.000Z	Pudgy	maco	cool. I read about packaging often, and I like the stories of the Motu, but the threshold of going from reading tutorial, and actually trying it I still didn't take.
2009-12-09T03:03:00.000Z	maco	Pudgy	have you seen the motu packaging 101 videos daniel holbach has on youtube? theyre easy to follow along with
2009-12-09T03:05:00.000Z	Pudgy	maco	I think I did yes. Maybe I should just take the plunge ;) Is there a mailinglist of some sort motu use?
2009-12-09T03:05:00.000Z	maco	Pudgy	yes, and i should get around to joining it since ive been one nearly a month now
2009-12-09T03:05:00.000Z	maco	Pudgy	lists.ubuntu.com has all the mailing lists
2009-12-09T03:06:00.000Z	Pudgy	maco	thanks for the info maco. I'll keep you informed ;)
2009-12-09T03:06:00.000Z	maco	Pudgy	no problem :)
