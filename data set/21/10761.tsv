2005-04-25T12:09:00.000Z	shad0w1e		from what ive been told. bsd works better when under stress, but linux is faster for personal use
2005-04-25T12:11:00.000Z	shad0w1e		how many MB is a kernel?
2005-04-25T12:12:00.000Z	shad0w1e		2.6.10
2005-04-25T12:12:00.000Z	shad0w1e		im talking about, roughly
2005-04-25T12:12:00.000Z	shad0w1e		im not talking about custom compiled
2005-04-25T12:13:00.000Z	shad0w1e		lets say , generally

2005-04-25T12:13:00.000Z	Amaranth	shad0w1e	Yes.
2005-04-25T12:07:00.000Z	Amaranth	shad0w1e	No it isn't.
2005-04-25T12:09:00.000Z	Amaranth	shad0w1e	Good question. Why don't you? :)
2005-04-25T12:09:00.000Z	Amaranth	shad0w1e	Not all apps written for linux will work on FreeBSD.
2005-04-25T12:09:00.000Z	Amaranth	shad0w1e	And afaik the Project Utopia stack is Linux only.
2005-04-25T12:12:00.000Z	Amaranth	shad0w1e	depends on the kernel
2005-04-25T12:12:00.000Z	Amaranth	shad0w1e	depends on what is has compiled and, what compiler was used, what version of the kernel, and what arch it's for.
2005-04-25T12:13:00.000Z	Amaranth	shad0w1e	No idea, check. :P
2005-04-25T12:14:00.000Z	Amaranth	shad0w1e	Yes.
2005-04-25T12:14:00.000Z	Amaranth	shad0w1e	Only the kernel changes.
2005-04-25T12:14:00.000Z	Amaranth	shad0w1e	All your apps, all your settings are the same.
