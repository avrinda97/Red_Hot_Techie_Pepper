2008-09-12T00:15:00.000Z	annoyed		anyone know how to make firefox not make me jump through 5 hoops to see a site with a self signed cert?
2008-09-12T00:15:00.000Z	annoyed		I can't find an about:config setting... am I missing it? or does it not exist?
2008-09-12T00:15:00.000Z	unfo	annoyed	maybe you can right-click and add it?  I dunno
2008-09-12T00:16:00.000Z	annoyed	unfo	nah... it takes 4 or 5 steps regardless.... no amount of right clicking fixes this ;)
2008-09-12T00:16:00.000Z	unfo	annoyed	no, right-click inside about:config settings list and go "New"
2008-09-12T00:17:00.000Z	annoyed	unfo	ah, I can see all the settings, none of them seem to pertain to my problem though... (no "allow self signed certs" setting or anything)
2008-09-12T00:17:00.000Z	unfo	annoyed	dunno.  Maybe try server irc.mozilla.org channel #firefox
2008-09-12T00:18:00.000Z	annoyed	unfo	lame...  I guess I can d/l the source and try "fixing" it myself... lol perhaps a fork is in order
2008-09-12T00:20:00.000Z	unfo	annoyed	there is an excellent reason why the new default is as it is.
2008-09-12T00:24:00.000Z	unfo	annoyed	basically, when Alice uses encryption to send a message to Bob, that usually makes sure only Bob can read it.  but if Bob uses a self-signed cert, then Alice doesn't know if Bob is the real Bob or an imposter.  But self-signed certs cause newbie users to see a lock.  So they think it's guaranteed they are talking to Bob.  Bad.  Makes sense?
2008-09-12T00:24:00.000Z	unfo	annoyed	was my message clipped in the middle?
2008-09-12T00:25:00.000Z	annoyed	unfo	I'm not really concerned about any of that honestly.  It's more a matter of "this should be optional"
2008-09-12T00:26:00.000Z	annoyed	unfo	I  mean, I get it, don't get me wrong.  I'm a developer, I do encryption software... I don't need a nanny though
2008-09-12T00:26:00.000Z	unfo	annoyed	but then some well-meaning "experts" will set their grandparents' PCs to accept self-signed certs as gold
2008-09-12T00:26:00.000Z	annoyed	unfo	that's their business
2008-09-12T00:26:00.000Z	unfo	annoyed	that actually hurts the grandparents.
2008-09-12T00:27:00.000Z	annoyed	unfo	sorry, freedom is far more important than security
2008-09-12T00:27:00.000Z	annoyed	unfo	always has been
2008-09-12T00:27:00.000Z	annoyed	unfo	always will be
2008-09-12T00:27:00.000Z	unfo	annoyed	that is why firefox lets you fork it :)
2008-09-12T00:27:00.000Z	annoyed	unfo	yep... or use opera ;)
