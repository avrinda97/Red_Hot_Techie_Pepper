2010-07-29T09:08:00.000Z	FreshPrince		why is ubuntu 64-bit Not recommended for daily desktop usage ?
2010-07-29T09:09:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	FreshPrince	i agree with this "bug" https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-website-content/+bug/585940
2010-07-29T09:14:00.000Z	FreshPrince	ZykoticK9	so what u think? should i get the 64-bit iso or not?, thats a joke, why it wouldn't be a good idea to use 64-bit for daily usage?
2010-07-29T09:15:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	FreshPrince	i use 64bit for my desktop.  i don't use 64bit on my htpc though, there are some emulators that are still 32bit only.  basically it's possible to use 64bit as well, or better then 32bit BUT it's more difficult to setup, thus "not recommended" or so the argument goes.
2010-07-29T09:17:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	FreshPrince	for 32bit libraries on 64bit Ubuntu check out the script getlibs it almost essential for 32bit compatibility
2010-07-29T09:20:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	FreshPrince	i agree - but honestly, if you have less then 4G of memory you're probably best not to bother (unless you're planning on upgrading later ;)
2010-07-29T09:21:00.000Z	FreshPrince	ZykoticK9	i have only 1gb memory, and i think i'm not going to upgrade for the next 5 years :D
2010-07-29T09:21:00.000Z	FreshPrince	ZykoticK9	so, i should use 32-bit if i have less than 4gb?
2010-07-29T09:22:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	FreshPrince	it might speed up a couple of things (like encoding) but it's probably not worth the extra effort with only 1GB, 64bit requires more memory to run the same app as 32bit does!
2010-07-29T09:22:00.000Z	FreshPrince	ZykoticK9	ok
2010-07-29T09:26:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	FreshPrince	the "just working" factor or Ubuntu is what brought ME from 5+ years of Gentoo.  Never been happier</ot>
2010-07-29T09:31:00.000Z	FreshPrince	ZykoticK9	i'm also an ex gentoo user, i just want a distro that just works, without to configure things all the time like u said -> gentoo -.- thats because ubuntu is great!
2010-07-29T09:31:00.000Z	FreshPrince	ZykoticK9	ubuntu runs i386? would that run slower then my archlinux which is i686?
2010-07-29T09:32:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	FreshPrince	the i386 is a lie!  it's i686 really.
2010-07-29T09:32:00.000Z	FreshPrince	ZykoticK9	a lie? i'm downlaoding ubuntu.10.04-i386.iso :p
2010-07-29T09:35:00.000Z	FreshPrince	ZykoticK9	check your "uname -a" did u see i686 there?
2010-07-29T09:36:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	FreshPrince	no because i'm running 64 so i see x86_64
2010-07-29T09:37:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	FreshPrince	pretty sure it will show up as x86 which will actually be i686, i386 is totally outdated at this point!
2010-07-29T09:40:00.000Z	FreshPrince	ZykoticK9	ok :), u know i like my current distro, but its terrible if nothing works correctly and u have to manually config all the things, and i didnt have the time to do that
2010-07-29T09:41:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	FreshPrince	sorry man chatting about this is really offtopic for this channel.  but i certainly agree with your statment.
2010-07-29T09:42:00.000Z	FreshPrince	ZykoticK9	life is to short to compile hours (gentoo) that because i left gentoo and went to archlinux
