2007-07-18T05:17:00.000Z	rockets		is it ok to delete everything in /var/apt/cache/archives
2007-07-18T05:17:00.000Z	rockets		or rather /var/cache/apt/archives
2007-07-18T05:18:00.000Z	astro76	rockets	yes apt-get clean will do that
2007-07-18T05:18:00.000Z	rockets	astro76	thanks
2007-08-03T05:56:00.000Z	astro76	rockets	actually it should probably go in ~/.profile, in ~/.bashrc it will only be effective in the terminal
2007-08-03T05:59:00.000Z	astro76	rockets	tar -tzf file.tar.gz
2007-08-04T09:28:00.000Z	astro76	rockets	dpkg -r
2007-08-04T09:28:00.000Z	rockets	astro76	yes, i know how to remove packages with dpkg. doesnt work.
2007-08-04T09:28:00.000Z	astro76	rockets	what error does it give?
2007-08-04T09:29:00.000Z	rockets	astro76	it cant find the package. im talking about i386 packages installed on an amd64 system using --ignore-architechture
2007-08-04T09:31:00.000Z	astro76	rockets	I wonder if you need the same option when you remove
2007-08-04T09:31:00.000Z	rockets	astro76	no you dont. it works fine. you just need to memorize the exact package name. doesnt show up in apt-cache search or synaptic like proper packages do
2007-08-04T09:32:00.000Z	rockets	astro76	i just figured that out
2007-08-04T09:46:00.000Z	astro76	rockets	not for everyone
2007-08-04T09:46:00.000Z	astro76	rockets	it's faster than on windows here
2007-08-04T09:46:00.000Z	rockets	astro76	50kb/s Max for me
2007-09-14T13:15:00.000Z	astro76	rockets	use the file command
2007-09-14T13:15:00.000Z	rockets	astro76	file command?
2007-09-14T13:15:00.000Z	astro76	rockets	in a terminal, file <filename>
2007-09-14T13:16:00.000Z	rockets	astro76	NICE
2007-09-17T10:55:00.000Z	astro76	rockets	crossvc
