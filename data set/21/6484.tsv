2007-04-17T10:33:00.000Z	nonuda_		guys, i have dual boot kubuntu and xp, both works fine before, but sudenlly now xp won't boot!, when i tried to boot xp, grub show me only "starting up" and a blinking cursor, it seems grub can't find xp kernel or anything to need xp boot..
2007-04-17T10:35:00.000Z	bill_k	nonuda_	you probably need to re-install grub
2007-04-17T10:36:00.000Z	nonuda_	bill_k	ok..how do i do that?
2007-04-17T10:36:00.000Z	bill_k	nonuda_	one sec
2007-04-17T10:38:00.000Z	nonuda_	bill_k	ok done
2007-04-17T10:38:00.000Z	bill_k	nonuda_	reboot, see if xp is there
2007-04-17T10:40:00.000Z	nonuda_	bill_k	sudo grub install makes me in grub session (in konsole, i'm in grub> prompt) do i just type reboot?

2007-04-17T10:43:00.000Z	bill_k	nonuda_	see that nice manual page?  most commands have one. Stuff in it may seem cryptic at first, but it will start to make sense
