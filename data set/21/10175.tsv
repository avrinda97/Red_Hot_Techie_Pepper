2005-06-16T11:57:00.000Z	lsuactiafner		Cerb[AWAY]  : sh /etc/init.d/gdm stop
2005-06-16T11:58:00.000Z	lsuactiafner		Cerb[AWAY]  : then control alt backspace to kill X
2005-06-16T11:58:00.000Z	lsuactiafner		should work
2005-06-16T11:58:00.000Z	lsuactiafner		Cerb[AWAY]  : tell me if my commands worked.
2005-06-16T11:58:00.000Z	lsuactiafner		cool
2005-06-16T11:59:00.000Z	lsuactiafner		took me ages to figure that out
2005-06-16T11:59:00.000Z	lsuactiafner		chmod -x /etc/init.d/gdm might work for you also Cerb[AWAY] 
2005-06-16T11:59:00.000Z	lsuactiafner		it should disable auto X startup
2005-06-16T11:59:00.000Z	lakin	lsuactiafner	aack!  that's not a good way to do it!?
2005-06-16T12:00:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	lakin	: but it works for me(tm)
2005-06-16T12:00:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	lakin	: yeh a noob shouldnt go there.. but bootup is much faster ifyou disable those scripts
2005-06-16T12:01:00.000Z	lakin	lsuactiafner	what I mean, is that you shouldn't be disabling boot stuff that way.
2005-06-16T12:02:00.000Z	lakin	lsuactiafner	remove it from the appropriate run-level directory:  /etc/rcX.d/ where x is one of 0,1,2,3,5,6, etc. I use rcconf which does it appropriately.
2005-06-16T12:05:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	lakin	: so how do you suggest i disable services? thing is i need to know to tell ppl the proper way then..
2005-06-16T12:05:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	lakin	: just download the 600mb..
2005-06-16T12:07:00.000Z	lakin	lsuactiafner	Howitzer: oh, I have the cd's for myself, but I wanted the nice versions to pass out to the non-converted.  AKA my dad.
2005-06-16T12:08:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	lakin	: install an Xp theme and he shouldnt notice the differance
2005-06-16T12:09:00.000Z	lakin	lsuactiafner	http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/InitScriptList
2005-06-16T12:10:00.000Z	lakin	lsuactiafner	it's not a problem of installing it myself, it's that my dad is on dialup, lives 3 time zones away, and I want him to hve a good impression of the software, some more professional than a burnt CD.
2005-06-16T12:19:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	lakin	: what card is that? i need to buy one
2005-06-16T12:20:00.000Z	lakin	lsuactiafner	DWL-G650, I read up on the ubuntu site about people's experiences with it, and this one seemed to work well.  Now I just need to see if I can get WPA-PSK working with wpa_supplicant
