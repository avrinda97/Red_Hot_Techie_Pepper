2004-10-18T15:58:00.000Z	punkass_	defendguin	  have u updated recently?
2004-10-19T16:00:00.000Z	punkass_	defendguin	do you have ndiswrapper-utils installed?
2004-10-19T16:11:00.000Z	defendguin	punkass_	what seems to be the problem?
2004-10-19T16:17:00.000Z	punkass_	defendguin	after   ifup  wlan0     the Essid is still set but not the key
2004-10-19T16:20:00.000Z	punkass_	defendguin	thats it...disabled the wep key on the router and ding..got a connection
2004-10-19T16:21:00.000Z	punkass_	defendguin	but i need to be able to use a wep key :)
2004-10-19T16:21:00.000Z	defendguin	punkass_	well at least you know where the problem is
2004-10-19T16:27:00.000Z	punkass_	defendguin	well if i hard code the wep in   interfaces   it works
2004-10-19T16:29:00.000Z	defendguin	punkass_	i wish there was a gui tool to scan for interfaces and then configure the card to use that interface
2004-10-19T16:29:00.000Z	punkass_	defendguin	i made one :)
2004-10-19T16:31:00.000Z	defendguin	punkass_	it needs to be run with root to do anything?
2004-10-19T16:37:00.000Z	defendguin	punkass_	how well does this work? and why isnt there already anything like it?
2004-10-19T16:54:00.000Z	defendguin	punkass_	would you like me to draw you an icon for your little app
2004-10-19T16:56:00.000Z	defendguin	punkass_	could you show me what you have so far?
2004-10-19T05:03:00.000Z	defendguin	punkass_	its still nice to have something to recognize the project by
2004-10-24T14:49:00.000Z	defendguin	punkass_	i found a problem with your pyfi app
2004-10-24T14:50:00.000Z	punkass_	defendguin	what is it?
2004-10-24T14:52:00.000Z	punkass_	defendguin	yes i also i have to learn how to seperate the I/O from the GUI
2004-10-24T14:53:00.000Z	punkass_	defendguin	but if i can get this wrapper working...should make the app work a little nicer too..without relying on the stdout and stderr
2004-10-24T14:54:00.000Z	punkass_	defendguin	why do they lock you out at school? isnt that why they have a wifi network?
2004-10-24T14:56:00.000Z	defendguin	punkass_	yeah but they locked out students for right now only faculty and staff
