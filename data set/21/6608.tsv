2007-02-27T10:07:00.000Z	alook		hi folks! i have a descision to make and tought maybe you can help. i have a server with suse linux 9.2 that has been running as a PDC (with ldap for storing users) and as a FileServer (raid 5 with 3ware escalate 9500S-8) for our department with about 15 users. I now wanted to update to a newer kernel (it has 2.6.8) because i have problems with a SATA drive, but my version of suse is no longer supoprted, so i consider switching to ubuntu. Are th
2007-02-27T10:07:00.000Z	alook		ere any good tutorials on howto setup a samba PDC with ldap on ubuntu?
2007-02-27T10:09:00.000Z	bulmer	alook	you dont like suse 9.3? they are still supported and not much different than 10.1 or 10.2
2007-02-27T10:10:00.000Z	alook	bulmer	well, i like suse.. but have switched from gentoo to ubuntu on my desktop and really love the apt system. (i hate the rpm system).. so i thougth maybe ubuntu would also be a good choice for the server
2007-02-27T10:11:00.000Z	bulmer	alook	thats just me, i prefer a distro thats supported widely in the business world..so i prefer suse for that
2007-02-27T10:12:00.000Z	alook	bulmer	did you ever do an update form suse 9.x to opensuse 10.x? is a pain-in-a** or will make me happy? ;)
2007-02-27T10:12:00.000Z	bulmer	alook	whats so wrong with installing a new 10.1 and just move over your data (assuming you have a separate partition for those) ?
2007-02-27T10:13:00.000Z	bulmer	alook	on separate hard disk that is..dont fool around with over-wrting same hard disk..
2007-02-27T10:13:00.000Z	bulmer	alook	assuming you are in the business world eh?
2007-02-27T10:13:00.000Z	alook	bulmer	well, it cant have a long downtime.. and if i do a new install i would need to reconfigure all the PDC/samba/ldap stuff.. not even thinking about how to get all the users back in.
2007-02-27T10:14:00.000Z	bulmer	alook	thats where your professional skills comes in... how to do planning of rolling out and cut-over.. :)
2007-02-27T10:14:00.000Z	alook	bulmer	business yes, seperate hard disk wont do.. i need do install on the available raid
2007-02-27T10:15:00.000Z	bulmer	alook	am not sure what business you're in, but to save a few buck and possibly loss data due to transition or downtime..umm..
2007-02-27T10:16:00.000Z	bulmer	alook	and no matter which server distro you use, there will be downtime
2007-02-27T10:16:00.000Z	alook	bulmer	i have some linux skills, but i have only set up the PDC/samva stuff once before.. i can remember it took me a few days until everything worked as expected..
2007-02-27T10:17:00.000Z	alook	bulmer	sure, there will be downtime.. but that ok as long as it wont take longer than a weekend.. so you recommend updating to opensuse?
2007-02-27T10:17:00.000Z	bulmer	alook	then perhaps you need to spend more time famiiliarizing on pdc/samba..its a tuff call i know
2007-02-27T10:18:00.000Z	bulmer	alook	I certainly would, it is widely supported, big businesses do
2007-02-27T10:19:00.000Z	bulmer	alook	a sample would be oracle running on suse...do i need to say more? ...brb
2007-02-27T10:21:00.000Z	alook	bulmer	ok, but what i dont like about suse is the thing that now happend to me.. i configured a system two years ago and now i have to start all over because the version i have is no longer supported.. i thought that with ubuntu and apt i won't have that kind of "do it again every few years" problem...
2007-02-27T10:36:00.000Z	bulmer	alook	the differences between the older 9.2 and 10.2 are not that much administrator wise
