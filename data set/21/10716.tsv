2005-02-08T15:54:00.000Z	scizzo		[PervertedMonk] : maybe if you asked what the problem is? :)
2005-02-08T15:55:00.000Z	scizzo		yes it is
2005-02-08T15:56:00.000Z	scizzo		mandrake? why would anyone ever consider using that? :P
2005-02-08T15:56:00.000Z	topyli	scizzo	i "considered" for years :)
2005-03-23T16:01:00.000Z	topyli	scizzo	i had that once. the problem then was that hal (the user) had been suddenly removed from a couple of groups
2005-03-23T16:01:00.000Z	scizzo	topyli	hmmm...might need to check that
2005-03-23T16:02:00.000Z	scizzo	topyli	should the user be a part of the group hal?
2005-03-23T16:03:00.000Z	topyli	scizzo	no, iirc. but hal needs to be in certain groups to be able to use the devices
2005-03-23T16:03:00.000Z	topyli	scizzo	i'm looking for the bug in bugzilla
2005-03-23T16:04:00.000Z	scizzo	topyli	its part of the group cdrom
2005-03-23T16:04:00.000Z	scizzo	topyli	etc
2005-03-23T16:04:00.000Z	scizzo	topyli	plugdev and so on
2005-03-23T16:05:00.000Z	topyli	scizzo	yeah you might have a different problem
2005-03-23T16:07:00.000Z	topyli	scizzo	bug #3986. hal was not in groups cdrom, floppy, plugdev
2005-03-23T16:08:00.000Z	topyli	scizzo	obviously you have some other problem
2005-03-23T16:09:00.000Z	scizzo	topyli	maybe not...
2005-04-15T13:34:00.000Z	topyli	scizzo	i guess they're still active, it's just a small team working on some kick-ass ideas. takes time, and they seem rewrite it completely from time to time :)
2005-04-15T13:37:00.000Z	scizzo	topyli	ok...because E17 has been in development for something like 2 years or so
2005-04-15T13:38:00.000Z	topyli	scizzo	yep. be strong and ye shall have E17 eventually
2005-04-15T13:39:00.000Z	scizzo	topyli	nah...using Mac OS X and Ubuntu at home.. :)
2005-04-15T13:39:00.000Z	scizzo	topyli	E17 is not that interesting at the moment
