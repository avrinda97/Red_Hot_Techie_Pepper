2006-02-28T11:15:00.000Z	cblboy		with winows xp and ubuntu
2006-02-28T11:16:00.000Z	cblboy		the only problem is that in the windows install, i no longer have any network connections
2006-02-28T11:16:00.000Z	cblboy		i can get to the internet
2006-02-28T11:16:00.000Z	cblboy		but no network resources
2006-02-28T11:16:00.000Z	cblboy		anybody know of any suggestions i can try?
2006-02-28T11:16:00.000Z	cblboy		would be greatly appreciated
2006-02-28T11:17:00.000Z	jimcooncat	cblboy	just because you set up dual-boot shouldn't change your connections with Windows
2006-02-28T11:17:00.000Z	cblboy		it must be, it only happened after the install of ubuntu
2006-02-28T11:18:00.000Z	jimcooncat	cblboy	you have network shares on you LAN you're not seeing?
2006-02-28T11:19:00.000Z	cblboy	jimcooncat	all i get is internet, can't see network connections
2006-02-28T11:19:00.000Z	cblboy		can't even use command line to gain net access
2006-02-28T11:19:00.000Z	jimcooncat	cblboy	when you're in ubuntu can you see them then?
2006-02-28T11:19:00.000Z	cblboy		no
2006-02-28T11:20:00.000Z	jimcooncat	cblboy	you can ping the computer that has the share you're trying to reach?
2006-02-28T11:20:00.000Z	cblboy		yes
2006-02-28T11:21:00.000Z	cblboy		i also have internet
2006-02-28T11:21:00.000Z	jimcooncat		and you had it working before you loaded ubuntu
2006-02-28T11:21:00.000Z	cblboy		yes, everything was fine before the ubuntu install
2006-02-28T11:22:00.000Z	cblboy		i might just re-ghost the pc with xp and put ubuntu on a standalone
2006-02-28T11:22:00.000Z	jimcooncat	cblboy	you can do that but it sounds like some other issue that needs to be worked out.
