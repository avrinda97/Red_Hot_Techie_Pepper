2012-08-22T20:48:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg		Hi everyone.
2012-08-22T20:48:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg		I still can't run ne Flash. :/
2012-08-22T20:49:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg		I have tried flashplugin-installer,Flash that i downloaded from Adobe website,Flash from the USC and restricted extras.
2012-08-22T20:50:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg		The flash doesn't work on Firefox or Chrome.
2012-08-22T20:51:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	nightwalkerkg	doesn't Chrome come with its own built-in Flash anyway?
2012-08-22T20:52:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg	[4-tea-2]	Yes it does,but it's not working. I get could not load plugin. And then i crashes.
2012-08-22T20:52:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	nightwalkerkg	have you tried turning it off and on again?
2012-08-22T20:53:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg	[4-tea-2]	Yes,like ten times.
2012-08-22T20:54:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	nightwalkerkg	sounds fishy to me, are you one some weird architecture? (like everything except i386 and amd64)
2012-08-22T20:56:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	nightwalkerkg	you could always try to create a fresh user account, log in as that new user, and start Chrome from there to make sure it's not a problem with anything you've done as your current user.
2012-08-22T20:59:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	nightwalkerkg	then I'm lost.
2012-08-22T21:01:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg	[4-tea-2]	Then think how lost i am. xD
2012-08-22T21:03:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg	[4-tea-2]	Is there an alternativ for flash ?
2012-08-22T21:05:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	nightwalkerkg	for real world purposes (which often include video playback), probably not, at least not when I last tried.
2012-08-22T21:05:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg	[4-tea-2]	Then i am *****. xD
2012-08-22T21:06:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	nightwalkerkg	I hate to say that, but if you've messed up your system so much that Chrome's bundled Flash crashes, you might want to consider a fresh install.
2012-08-22T21:07:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg	[4-tea-2]	The only problem is. This is a fresh install. xD
2012-08-22T21:07:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	nightwalkerkg	great, then you're not losing much.
2012-08-22T21:08:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	nightwalkerkg	just try google-chrome first this time, before you start to try seven different methods of installing flash. :)
2012-08-22T21:10:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg	[4-tea-2]	I think i am going to cry. xD
2012-08-22T21:17:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg	[4-tea-2]	I made some progres. Now i get : Could not load shockwave flash.
