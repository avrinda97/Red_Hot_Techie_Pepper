2012-08-26T00:32:00.000Z	Newb100		hi folks, Say fir example I wanted to build a stand alone program for ubuntu what are the steps to do it?
2012-08-26T00:33:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Newb100	you'd need to pick a language to program in and an idea of what your app is going to do
2012-08-26T00:34:00.000Z	Newb100	ThinkT510	I pick C++ and its going to be a database
2012-08-26T00:35:00.000Z	Newb100	ThinkT510	like open office base
2012-08-26T00:37:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Newb100	so you've made the app then?
2012-08-26T00:38:00.000Z	Newb100	ThinkT510	But after I have the written program in a language, How do I make it a stand alone program
2012-08-26T00:39:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Newb100	depends on how you've written it and what dependencies it requires
2012-08-26T00:39:00.000Z	Newb100	ThinkT510	So How would I create a stand alone program like Open office base on ubuntu?
2012-08-26T00:40:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Newb100	if you don't know how to program in c++ then you are getting way ahead of yourself here
2012-08-26T00:41:00.000Z	Newb100	ThinkT510	 I want to know the metod
2012-08-26T00:41:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Newb100	what method?
2012-08-26T00:42:00.000Z	Newb100	ThinkT510	Of creating a program from scratch where you can click an icon and it load up
2012-08-26T00:42:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Newb100	i don't mean to be rude but it sounds as if you don't know the first thing about programming
2012-08-26T00:43:00.000Z	Newb100	ThinkT510	True, but I want to know what the method is to getting to a completed executable program
2012-08-26T00:43:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Newb100	you need to learn the language first
2012-08-26T00:44:00.000Z	Newb100	ThinkT510	Once I written this code, How do I then make it into a program?
2012-08-26T00:46:00.000Z	Newb100	ThinkT510	I can write programs in C
2012-08-26T00:46:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Newb100	great
2012-08-26T00:47:00.000Z	Newb100	ThinkT510	 So now I compile it and it runs, but I want to make it so it can be downloaded and installed by other people on ubuntu
2012-08-26T01:00:00.000Z	Newb100	ThinkT510	Ok thanks for the links. I have written my c program, Now I want to leave it in a compiled state so I dont have to keep compiling everytime I want to use it, How do i do that. i.e. an Icon on the desktop
2012-08-26T01:03:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Newb100	what are you compiling it with?
