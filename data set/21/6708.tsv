2007-02-12T16:15:00.000Z	tom__	faemir_	i wouldn't transcode from mp3 to ogg, you will lose sound quality. both are lossy formats.
2007-02-12T16:16:00.000Z	faemir_	tom__	my mp3s are 320 kbps - i would be happy with 128 kbps
2007-02-12T16:34:00.000Z	faemir_	tom__	what does beryl currently have over compiz?
2007-02-12T16:35:00.000Z	tom__	faemir_	i believe beryl has plugins compiz doesn't have, and i think beryl has better AIGLX support, but i'm not sure.
2007-02-12T16:43:00.000Z	faemir_	tom__	so when looking for stable I should use compiz instead?
2007-02-12T16:43:00.000Z	tom__	faemir_	i don't know i don't use compiz, but i can tell you this: beryl is very stable for me.
2007-02-12T16:43:00.000Z	faemir_	tom__	(and what is the objective of the fork of beryl btw)
2007-02-12T16:43:00.000Z	faemir_	tom__	ok
2007-02-12T16:43:00.000Z	faemir_	tom__	bit of a memory whore when everything is turned on though :P
2007-02-12T16:43:00.000Z	tom__	faemir_	just don't expect to be playing games or watching high res videos.
