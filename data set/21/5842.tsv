2007-10-11T13:59:00.000Z	Hornet_	Jordan_U	it managed to crash, so I had to repair xorg with vi, which wasn't fun.
2007-10-11T14:00:00.000Z	Hornet_	Jordan_U	what was the next step, again?
2007-10-11T14:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Hornet_	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh
2007-10-11T14:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Hornet_	That actually would have saved you fixing your xorg.conf in vi :)
2007-10-11T14:03:00.000Z	Hornet_	Jordan_U	Heh, possibly, I didn't have any choice though, it completely locked up.
2007-10-11T14:04:00.000Z	Hornet_	Jordan_U	okay, done.
2007-10-11T14:07:00.000Z	Hornet_	Jordan_U	It's now back to ATI, what should I do now?
2007-10-11T14:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Hornet_	Try restarting X and see if AIGLX works again
2007-10-11T14:12:00.000Z	Hornet_	Jordan_U	how can I tell which mode it's in safely?  I usually test it with Fusion, which results in slow performance / a crash if it's the wrong one.
2007-10-11T14:17:00.000Z	Hornet_	Jordan_U	are you still about?
2007-10-11T14:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Hornet_	Yes
2007-10-11T14:20:00.000Z	Hornet_	Jordan_U	aha, good stuff, thanks. :)
2007-10-11T14:20:00.000Z	Hornet_	Jordan_U	How can I find out my current graphics mode with the terminal?
2007-10-11T14:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Hornet_	What do you mean by "graphics mode" ?
2007-10-11T14:21:00.000Z	Hornet_	Jordan_U	display mode, then.  XGL, FRGLX etc.
2007-10-11T14:26:00.000Z	Hornet_	Jordan_U	how can I find out the display mode, then?  I'd rather not try Fusion in case it crashes.
2007-10-11T14:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Hornet_	glxinfo
2007-10-11T14:45:00.000Z	Hornet_	Jordan_U	Sorry, was distracted.  It looks like it's SGI.
2007-10-11T14:45:00.000Z	Hornet_	Jordan_U	it's possible it was XGL mode after all, but even so I'm still not sure how to get back to it.
2007-10-11T14:50:00.000Z	Hornet_	Jordan_U	how can I get it into AIXGL / XGL mode, then? :\
