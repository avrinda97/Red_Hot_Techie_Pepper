2007-07-06T06:39:00.000Z	`Nick		why would the ubuntu install freeze on the Partitions formatting part at 33%?
2007-07-06T06:40:00.000Z	daan	`Nick	could be anything really
2007-07-06T06:40:00.000Z	`Nick	daan	it does it every time, sometimes it just sticks - other times it finishes and throws an error that's so bland it could mean dang near anything
2007-07-06T06:41:00.000Z	daan	`Nick	did you try gparted?
2007-07-06T06:41:00.000Z	`Nick	daan	gparted?
2007-07-06T06:41:00.000Z	daan	`Nick	you can run it from a livecd
2007-07-06T06:41:00.000Z	daan	`Nick	http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php
2007-07-06T06:42:00.000Z	`Nick	daan	so it's a diff os?
2007-07-06T06:42:00.000Z	daan	`Nick	it is possible that program gives you a better error or it will just work
2007-07-06T06:43:00.000Z	daan	`Nick	it's linux with the gparted program on it
2007-07-06T06:43:00.000Z	daan	`Nick	you can try it with that instead of the Ubuntu installer
2007-07-06T06:43:00.000Z	`Nick	daan	ok
2007-07-06T06:44:00.000Z	`Nick	daan	i have to keep formatting the hd every time the install fails [7 times so far] 
2007-07-06T06:45:00.000Z	`Nick	daan	could low battery be a potential issue?
2007-07-06T06:45:00.000Z	`Nick	daan	as in issue that would mess up the install
2007-07-06T06:46:00.000Z	daan	`Nick	don't think so
2007-07-06T06:46:00.000Z	`Nick	daan	idk then
2007-07-06T06:46:00.000Z	daan	`Nick	I'd say try it with the livecd
2007-07-06T06:46:00.000Z	`Nick	daan	alright
2007-07-06T06:54:00.000Z	`Nick	daan	so gparted is like an alternate ubuntu installer?
2007-07-06T06:55:00.000Z	daan	`Nick	no it is a harddrive partitioning program
