2009-12-25T03:17:00.000Z	Umeaboy	nucc1	Playing wmv/wma-files.
2009-12-25T03:18:00.000Z	nucc1	Umeaboy	you need to install w32codecs and many of the gstreamer plugins
2009-12-25T03:19:00.000Z	Umeaboy	nucc1	Not for 64-bits.
2009-12-25T03:20:00.000Z	nucc1	Umeaboy	then w64codecs :d
2009-12-25T03:21:00.000Z	Umeaboy	nucc1	I installed that already with thoose instructions!!!!!!!
2009-12-25T03:22:00.000Z	nucc1	Umeaboy	i'm on a 32 bit system, so can't say, but WMA plays fine on my pc, or so i think :p
2009-12-25T03:23:00.000Z	nucc1	Umeaboy	it doesn't play with rhythmbox?
2009-12-25T03:23:00.000Z	Umeaboy	nucc1	Nope. I'm being asked to install a codec that can't be found.
2009-12-25T03:24:00.000Z	nucc1	Umeaboy	: ah, mine says that too, but i just assume the files will play anywa
2009-12-25T03:24:00.000Z	nucc1	Umeaboy	the WMA's play anyway
2009-12-25T03:25:00.000Z	nucc1	Umeaboy	my rhythmbox says that message, but it still plays the files.
2009-12-25T03:25:00.000Z	Umeaboy	nucc1	Well, mine didn't find any decoder.
2009-12-25T03:26:00.000Z	nucc1	Umeaboy	make sure you have ffmpeg installed too, gstreamer plugins ugly and multiverse and bad.
2009-12-25T03:26:00.000Z	Umeaboy	nucc1	Done that to.
2009-12-25T03:27:00.000Z	nucc1	Umeaboy	hmmm, you're on ubuntu 9.10? and you have the medibuntu repository added?
2009-12-25T03:27:00.000Z	Umeaboy	nucc1	Yes.
