2007-11-23T08:41:00.000Z	thinsoldier		i've got 14 folders found with 'apache' in the name, which one probably contains the settings for apache that would let me use .htaccess files?
2007-11-23T08:43:00.000Z	thinsoldier		nope: thats just the default web root
2007-11-23T08:43:00.000Z	thinsoldier		no settings in there
2007-11-23T08:44:00.000Z	thinsoldier		ok found it
2007-11-23T08:44:00.000Z	thinsoldier		is there any documentation on what the F /etc/ means and all the other top level folders
2007-11-23T08:44:00.000Z	thinsoldier		i'd be less lost if I had a clue what these words stood for
2007-11-23T08:45:00.000Z	thinsoldier		where
2007-11-23T08:45:00.000Z	thinsoldier		when dragging and dropping, what key makes it a shortcut?

2007-11-23T08:53:00.000Z	thinsoldier		gksudo? a little more info?
2007-11-23T08:54:00.000Z	thinsoldier		hmm.... i'm so tempted to just try loggin in as root all the time
2007-11-23T08:55:00.000Z	thinsoldier		but this is more annoying than vista (and i fukin hate vista)
2007-11-23T08:55:00.000Z	thinsoldier		is there nothing that adds 'run as root' or 'open as root' to the context menu?
2007-11-23T08:56:00.000Z	zachary	thinsoldier	 bad idea :)  Root is dangerous.  you can create shortcuts to gksudo programs in the menu editor so you don't need to type anything.
