2007-03-01T14:20:00.000Z	K3nto		need help switching to admin mode so i can tell ubuntu whos boss
2007-03-01T14:21:00.000Z	Slart	K3nto	admin mode? sudo su doesn't do it for you?
2007-03-01T14:21:00.000Z	Slart	K3nto	you know about sudo?
2007-03-01T14:22:00.000Z	Slart	K3nto	then use another distro.. slackware? or debian will let you do as you want.. ubuntu is a little more "nice"  to new users..
2007-03-01T14:23:00.000Z	Slart	K3nto	but if you don't even know about sudo perhaps you should play with being root to much.. you run with scissors bad things are going to happen ;)
2007-03-01T14:24:00.000Z	Slart	K3nto	but try using sudo for now.. when you run into the limitations you can come back and try to sort that out
2007-03-01T14:24:00.000Z	Slart	K3nto	personally.. I don't even know what the limitations are.. never run into any so far
2007-03-01T14:26:00.000Z	K3nto	Slart	what im looking for : http://img58.imageshack.us/img58/4673/screenshotsg4.png
2007-03-01T14:27:00.000Z	Slart	K3nto	eh.. you want a cross over your local disk? or you don't want it to show up there?
2007-03-01T14:28:00.000Z	Slart	K3nto	hmm.. I'll have a look... hold on
2007-03-01T14:31:00.000Z	Slart	K3nto	I'm not sure about this.. those names don't really exist anywhere else but in nautilus.. you might get better answers asking in #gnome or #nautilus
2007-03-01T14:31:00.000Z	Slart	K3nto	I don't think it's a permission problem.. probably they just didn't think anyone would want to rename them =)
2007-03-01T14:32:00.000Z	Slart	K3nto	I think those shortcuts are created when nautilus is started.. there might be some setting somewhere.. but I don't know where
2007-03-01T14:35:00.000Z	Slart	K3nto	I don't think they sat down and said "well.. should the filthy mob be allowed to rename this? nooooo.. that's to good for them".. they probably just didn't implement it.. and did something else useful instead.. but as always.. you're free to patch the source ;)
2007-03-01T14:38:00.000Z	Slart	K3nto	there are other file system browsers out there.. perhaps one of them might be more to your liking
2007-03-02T17:40:00.000Z	Slart	K3nto	I had some problems using the version in the repository.. I think I got a newer one from their site which worked better.. but it might just be me
2007-03-02T17:37:00.000Z	Slart	K3nto	depends on what parts of itunes you want
2007-03-02T17:37:00.000Z	Slart	K3nto	if it's synching with an ipod then I think amarok will do nicely..
2007-03-02T17:38:00.000Z	Slart	K3nto	but I don't think amarok will let you buy music from itunes
2007-03-09T08:17:00.000Z	Slart	K3nto	basically just a folder where the contents of the harddrive/cd, or whatever. show up
2007-03-09T08:19:00.000Z	K3nto	Slart	ok great thanks
