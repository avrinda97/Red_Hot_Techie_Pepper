2008-08-31T09:51:00.000Z	ekow		Hello, i have ubuntu currently installed on my laptop and i've used the gparted live cd to partition an NTFS section of my hard drive so i can dual boot with xp, however when i put in the xp disc the setup says "Unknown Disk: There is no disk in this drive"
2008-08-31T09:53:00.000Z	blitz	ekow	is it the hard drive not recognized? sounds like may be the windows disk
2008-08-31T09:54:00.000Z	ekow	blitz	i've tried with multiple disks..
2008-08-31T09:55:00.000Z	blitz	ekow	are you getting into the install program?
2008-08-31T09:56:00.000Z	ekow	blitz	i get passed the license agreement, then it's the screen that is supposed to show all of your hard drive's partitions that gives me the error message
2008-08-31T09:57:00.000Z	blitz	ekow	can you mount the partition and work with it in ubuntu?
2008-08-31T09:58:00.000Z	ekow	blitz	yeah i think so, however the option to unmount it is in gray, so maybe i have to use the gparted live disc instead
2008-08-31T09:59:00.000Z	ekow	blitz	uh oh wait... just found somethin
2008-08-31T09:59:00.000Z	ekow	blitz	there's a ! sign by it
2008-08-31T09:59:00.000Z	blitz	ekow	whats the error?
2008-08-31T10:00:00.000Z	ekow	blitz	and it says "Unable to read the contents of this filesystem! Because of this some operations may be unavailable."
2008-08-31T10:00:00.000Z	blitz	ekow	perhaps from a livecd environment use gparted to delete and reformat the partition
2008-08-31T10:00:00.000Z	ekow	blitz	ok i'll try that
2008-08-31T10:00:00.000Z	ekow	blitz	thanks
2008-08-31T10:00:00.000Z	blitz	ekow	make sure its primary
2008-08-31T10:01:00.000Z	ekow	blitz	primary? how do i do that?
2008-08-31T10:01:00.000Z	blitz	ekow	you got the choice of primary or logical when you makle it
2008-08-31T10:01:00.000Z	ekow	blitz	oh okay
2008-08-31T10:34:00.000Z	ekow	blitz	hey i'm back, i deleted and reparted it but it still has the ! error... i'm gonna look into that error actually, see if anyone is getting it
