2012-10-11T05:37:00.000Z	redsfan1		Hey I was just asking questions about dual booting but had to change my Nick, my question was.
2012-10-11T05:37:00.000Z	redsfan1		New to computers in general here, trying to learn as much as possible! I just built my first PC two days ago and installed Ubuntu 12.04 on it from the get go.  I've watched and read a ton of tutorials on how to dual boot to add windows and they all start from having windows first and adding ubuntu, not sure what to do.
2012-10-11T05:39:00.000Z	redsfan1		Any links or tutorials on how to do so? or what do you recommend for a noob?
2012-10-11T05:39:00.000Z	redsfan1		Thanks, does it also say how to partition the hard drive for me to add windows? I've also never done that before
2012-10-11T05:39:00.000Z	redsfan1		I only have one drive :/
2012-10-11T05:41:00.000Z	redsfan1		No idea how to do that, I'm trying to learn though.  Is there a way to erase whats on my hard drive (Ubutntu) then install windows from the get go then install ubuntu again?
2012-10-11T05:41:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	redsfan1	Install gparted in ubuntu the partitioner, open it and take a screen shot of the HD and put it in a imagebin this will save the 20 questions on getting to a dual boot.
2012-10-11T05:44:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	redsfan1	If you post the gparted image I think we can bet to better than speculation, and opinions.
2012-10-11T05:47:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	redsfan1	You would just install gparted it is in the software center. You would use the prtc key to capture an image of it, you would go to the imagebin link the bot gave post that screen image and opost the url.
2012-10-11T06:26:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	redsfan1	Go ahead
2012-10-11T06:28:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	redsfan1	Yeah, but I have used the windows dvd to usb loader, some have claimed unetbootin works, never had success myself.  You can extract the ISO to a ntfs in the usb in linux and have a bot flag, and it will boot.
2012-10-11T06:29:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	redsfan1	To exatract the ISO in ubuntu though I believe you have to mount the ISO, it wont just extract with the file loader
2012-10-11T06:32:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	redsfan1	sure in windows it is a simple app.
2012-10-11T06:32:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	redsfan1	If you have a dvd burner just get a dvd and burn it.
2012-10-11T06:33:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	redsfan1	In linux it is trickier if a auto iso loader like the unetbootin ap does not work, just putting the ISO in the usb I don't think will work.
2012-10-11T06:34:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	redsfan1	YOu have any friends with windows?
2012-10-11T06:35:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	redsfan1	Then use this app in windows to load the usb.  https://wudt.codeplex.com/
2012-10-11T06:39:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	redsfan1	If you are not sure it is legit I would not install it to be honest.
2012-10-11T06:40:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	redsfan1	You can get a legit ISO, I have alink to digital river but I can't post it per channel rules.
2012-10-11T06:42:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	redsfan1	If you have a key and it is legal MS will let you download.
2012-10-11T06:44:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	redsfan1	WE are well into offtopic here now you might check with the ##windows channel.
