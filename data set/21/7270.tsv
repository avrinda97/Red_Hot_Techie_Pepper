2006-10-30T16:12:00.000Z	Gecko	mrpk``	did you compile that module yourself?
2006-10-30T16:13:00.000Z	mrpk``	Gecko	i compiled it myselvm based on this tutorial http://frealek.dotnode.com/blog/view/177
2006-10-30T16:13:00.000Z	Gecko	mrpk``	ok, hold on
2006-10-30T16:14:00.000Z	Gecko	mrpk``	that tutorial includes compiling your own kernel. Did you do that?
2006-10-30T16:15:00.000Z	mrpk``	Gecko	no i didnt. reason : my kernel is up2date as i installed ubuntu 3 days ago and made apt-get upgrade ...
2006-10-30T16:16:00.000Z	Gecko	mrpk``	ok, well that's your reason then. The errors you get are because the cryptography modules needed for this driver to work aren't available in your kernel
2006-10-30T16:17:00.000Z	Gecko	mrpk``	You might want to consider reading the tutorials on the wiki for recompiling the kernel
2006-10-30T16:17:00.000Z	mrpk``	Gecko	i dont get that.. my kernel did already work with the ipw2100 drivers ubuntu came with.  i just wanted to re-install current versions of ipw2100 and ieee80210...
2006-10-30T16:18:00.000Z	Gecko	mrpk``	yes, but the headers for the 802.11x part weren't available when you compiled it, so that's why it fails
2006-10-30T16:18:00.000Z	Gecko	mrpk``	you should stick with the ubuntu version of the drivers
2006-10-30T16:19:00.000Z	mrpk``	Gecko	too late but a good hint :)
2006-10-30T16:21:00.000Z	mrpk``	Gecko	what do i do now ? puttin ubuntu dic back to drive and re-install ubuntu ? :'(
2006-10-30T16:22:00.000Z	Gecko	mrpk``	no, that shouldn't be necessary. Try apt-get --reinstall install <name of your driver>
2006-10-30T16:23:00.000Z	mrpk``	Gecko	apt didnt find the package
2006-10-30T16:24:00.000Z	Gecko	mrpk``	so, what exactly did you do that made the previous driver unavailable?
2006-10-30T16:26:00.000Z	Gecko	mrpk``	ok, just find out what files it removed (and replaced, so that should be easy) and search for one of them at packages.ubuntu.com - then you can do the apt-get --reinstall part
2006-10-30T16:29:00.000Z	Gecko	mrpk``	you're welcome
