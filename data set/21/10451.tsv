2005-02-28T06:59:00.000Z	deki_		i have big problems with performance of the system
2005-02-28T06:59:00.000Z	deki_		the windows are drawed with delays from up to bottom
2005-02-28T06:59:00.000Z	deki_		on the mandrake 10.1 with 2.6.3 kernel there are no such things
2005-02-28T07:00:00.000Z	deki_		i think that it is a preemption kernel
2005-02-28T07:00:00.000Z	deki_		how to switch a preemption off?
2005-02-28T07:00:00.000Z	deki_		or can you give me some tips how to builg and INTEGRATE vanilla kernel into ubuntu?
2005-02-28T07:02:00.000Z	SiRrUs	deki_	mandrake 10.1 was the slowest for me
2005-02-28T07:02:00.000Z	deki_	SiRrUs	i am talking about mandrake 10.0
2005-02-28T07:02:00.000Z	deki_		not 10.1
2005-02-28T07:03:00.000Z	deki_	SiRrUs	with kernel 2.6.3
2005-02-28T07:03:00.000Z	deki_		now i have kernel 2.6.10-3-k7 with all the stupid patches which perverted it from vanilla
2005-02-28T07:03:00.000Z	SiRrUs	deki_	and 10.0 is even slower
2005-02-28T07:03:00.000Z	deki_	SiRrUs	i have exotic hardware
2005-02-28T07:03:00.000Z	deki_	SiRrUs	then ubuntu is much more slower
2005-02-28T07:03:00.000Z	deki_	SiRrUs	look
2005-02-28T07:03:00.000Z	deki_	SiRrUs	i can see how it draws windows even with nvidia driver enabled!
2005-02-28T07:04:00.000Z	deki_		and hardware accel
2005-02-28T07:04:00.000Z	deki_		ok
2005-02-28T07:04:00.000Z	SiRrUs	deki_	then why not just use Mandrake???
2005-02-28T07:04:00.000Z	deki_		i will solve this problem myself, another question: what is the default burning app for ubuntu
2005-02-28T07:04:00.000Z	deki_	SiRrUs	i will do it maybe
