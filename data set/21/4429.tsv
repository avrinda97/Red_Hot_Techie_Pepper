2008-09-14T07:41:00.000Z	Phase		Is there a key combination to do "Lock Screen"?
2008-09-14T07:42:00.000Z	Flannel	Phase	ctrl-alt-L by default I believe.
2008-12-23T10:55:00.000Z	Flannel	Phase	build-essential
2008-12-23T10:55:00.000Z	Phase	Flannel	thanks
2011-08-25T08:02:00.000Z	Flannel	Phase	try Phase ALL=NOPASSWD: /sbin/swapon, /sbin/swapoff
2011-08-25T08:02:00.000Z	Flannel	Phase	not that.
2011-08-25T08:03:00.000Z	Phase	Flannel	:P
2011-08-25T08:03:00.000Z	Flannel	Phase	Phase ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /sbin/swapon, /sbin/swapoff
2011-08-25T08:03:00.000Z	Phase	Flannel	Alright, let me try that
2011-08-25T08:04:00.000Z	Phase	Flannel	hm, still asking for password, and yes theadmin.. only me
2011-08-25T08:05:00.000Z	Flannel	Phase	Change the /usr/sbin/yaddayadda to some other arbitrary command, see if it asks for a password.
2011-08-25T08:08:00.000Z	Phase	Flannel	That didn't work, I changed it to 'phase   ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/echo' and it still asked for a password. I'm using Lubuntu/LXTerminal encase theres a subtle difference
2011-08-25T08:09:00.000Z	Flannel	Phase	shouldn't be, no.
2011-08-25T08:09:00.000Z	Flannel	Phase	Are you the only one on this machine?
2011-08-25T08:09:00.000Z	Phase	Flannel	yeah
2011-08-25T08:10:00.000Z	Phase	Flannel	I even tried opening a new LXTerminal window entirely with no luck
2011-08-25T08:10:00.000Z	Flannel	Phase	Alright, just for kicks, lets try ALL ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/echo
2011-08-25T08:11:00.000Z	Flannel	Phase	yeah, that's your problem, what theadmin said.
2011-08-25T08:12:00.000Z	Flannel	Phase	You basically remove your special status by overwriting it later, yes.
2011-08-25T08:12:00.000Z	Flannel	Phase	Just move that line to the end (above the includes, or after the includes if you desire)
2011-08-25T08:14:00.000Z	Phase	Flannel	theadmin: Bingo. Thanks guys.
