2011-10-16T01:51:00.000Z	nicofs		Can someone help me debug my wifi connection? I am connected, there is reception - but the internet is not stable... for a short period i can ping google in about 40ms and then without reason it shoots up to beyond 3000ms... i just don't know what's wrong...
2011-10-16T01:51:00.000Z	yagoo	nicofs	are you connecting to your own wifi?
2011-10-16T01:51:00.000Z	yagoo	nicofs	be sure of that first..
2011-10-16T01:51:00.000Z	nicofs	yagoo	yes
2011-10-16T01:52:00.000Z	yagoo	nicofs	try pinging your own gateway..
2011-10-16T01:52:00.000Z	yagoo	nicofs	and see if that spikes
2011-10-16T01:53:00.000Z	nicofs	yagoo	how do i find out, what my gateway is?
2011-10-16T01:53:00.000Z	yagoo	nicofs	^
2011-10-16T01:53:00.000Z	yagoo	nicofs	if u dont know ur gateway ip# (local ip#), then u probably didnt setup ur wifi server
2011-10-16T01:54:00.000Z	nicofs	yagoo	i know the ip of the router... if that's what you mean
2011-10-16T01:54:00.000Z	yagoo	nicofs	try pinging that and see if there's a spike
2011-10-16T01:55:00.000Z	yagoo	nicofs	how far away are u from the router? (maybe there's intereference with other things at channel 6.. try another channel)
2011-10-16T01:55:00.000Z	nicofs	yagoo	and you are correct, i did not set it up - i only use it - with many devices, all of which have no issues apart from the one i'm writing about...
2011-10-16T01:55:00.000Z	yagoo	nicofs	good luck.
2011-10-16T01:57:00.000Z	nicofs	yagoo	it uses no encryption apart from a mac filter table - so there should be no issues about that. pinging the router results in times between 1.4 and 2500ms - and makes my internet connection even worse...
2011-10-16T01:58:00.000Z	yagoo	nicofs	then it's something between your laptop and your router.
2011-10-16T01:58:00.000Z	yagoo	nicofs	and you should be using encryption. Mac Filtering can always be spoofed.
2011-10-16T02:00:00.000Z	nicofs	yagoo	i know that i should - but it's not my decision and so i can't change that... and not my problem atm. i just want to surf the internet...
2011-10-16T02:07:00.000Z	yagoo	nicofs	i already told u what to try.. did u even try it?
2011-10-16T02:08:00.000Z	nicofs	yagoo	you told me, it's something between me and the router - and that i should use encryption... or did you mean something else...?
2011-10-16T02:19:00.000Z	nicofs	yagoo	still there? if using encryption wasn't your advice, then your advice didn't get to me...
