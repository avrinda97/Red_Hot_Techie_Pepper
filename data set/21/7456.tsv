2007-06-22T13:06:00.000Z	|_ocke		i did
2007-06-22T13:06:00.000Z	|_ocke		but it still is the same..
2007-06-22T13:06:00.000Z	|_ocke		er wait
2007-06-22T13:07:00.000Z	|_ocke		maybe i need to mount /dev/hda1 and edit it on there
2007-06-22T13:07:00.000Z	|_ocke		since im running off hdb1, i must have edited the one on this partition, which isnt loaded on boot
2007-06-22T13:07:00.000Z	|_ocke		of course i saved it :)
2007-06-22T13:08:00.000Z	|_ocke		ive been running linuxes for like 6-7 years, i dont forget stuff like saving or sudo, but sometimes i cant see the forest for the trees
2007-06-22T13:10:00.000Z	|_ocke		i dont really intend to reinstall unless i get another machine entirely and am running it alongside this one
2007-06-22T13:12:00.000Z	|_ocke		otherwise i intend to keep the same installation with my settings and data, heck i even pulled the original install (/dev/hda1) from the previous machine (celeron 1ghz) and pt it in this athlonxp 3000+ and just changed the necessary devices hehe
2007-06-22T13:13:00.000Z	|_ocke		then i had memory and swapping issues so i installed a 80gb drive on top of this one and made a 4gb swap partition as /dev/hdb5
2007-06-22T13:15:00.000Z	wols_	|_ocke	you should have bought more RAM
2007-06-22T13:20:00.000Z	wols_	|_ocke	invest 20$ and buy 512MB more ram
2007-06-22T13:21:00.000Z	|_ocke	wols_	if i had $20 to spend on the computer i wouldnt be messing with all that in the first place

2007-06-22T13:25:00.000Z	wols_	|_ocke	if it's socket a, it's DDR1
2007-06-22T13:29:00.000Z	|_ocke	wols_	well its ddr1 then, but i still cant afford to buy any :P
2007-06-22T14:59:00.000Z	wols_	|_ocke	it could run a spam or DDOS zombie easily
2007-06-22T15:10:00.000Z	wols_	|_ocke	no
