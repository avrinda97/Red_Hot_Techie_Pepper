2007-05-02T06:46:00.000Z	Ultimo|Yayinstal	phixnay	- Will do. In the meantime, can I have a link to that Wiki please?
2007-05-02T06:47:00.000Z	phixnay	Ultimo|Yayinstal	yes, thought is is a little outdated. Use with caution : ) http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/joomla/index.php?/component/option,com_openwiki/Itemid,33/id,installation/
2007-05-02T06:48:00.000Z	Ultimo|Yayinstal	phixnay	- Looks like everything went through, then.
2007-05-02T06:48:00.000Z	phixnay	Ultimo|Yayinstal	great
2007-05-02T06:49:00.000Z	Ultimo|Yayinstal	phixnay	- I'll have to figure out how to get to the configuration point now. XP
2007-05-02T06:50:00.000Z	phixnay	Ultimo|Yayinstal	use network manager if you can : )
2007-05-02T06:58:00.000Z	Ultimo|Yayinstal	phixnay	- Well, I got my SSID and WEP put in, and set the connectivity to DHCP.
2007-05-02T06:59:00.000Z	phixnay	Ultimo|Yayinstal	alright, any problems so far?
2007-05-02T07:00:00.000Z	Ultimo|Yayinstal	phixnay	- Kind of. I don't seem to be able to connect to the internet via browser yet.
2007-05-02T07:01:00.000Z	phixnay	Ultimo|Yayinstal	does network manager say you are connected?
2007-05-02T07:05:00.000Z	Ultimo|Yayinstal	phixnay	- Lemme check if I'm connected or not, I don't believe I am.
2007-05-02T07:05:00.000Z	phixnay	Ultimo|Yayinstal	it should be a little icon in the top right corner
2007-05-02T07:06:00.000Z	Ultimo|Yayinstal	phixnay	- All right. It changed to a wireless strength indicator, and then it asked for a keyring password or something like that, and completely froze the PC.
2007-05-02T07:07:00.000Z	phixnay	Ultimo|Yayinstal	lol that was completely unexpected. Is it an old computer, or just bad luck?
2007-05-02T07:07:00.000Z	Ultimo|Yayinstal	phixnay	- Bad luck, methinks. It's a mini Dell, has all kinds of laptop components, but it's a desktop.
2007-05-02T07:08:00.000Z	phixnay	Ultimo|Yayinstal	See if ctrl-alt-backspace unfreezes you
2007-05-02T07:08:00.000Z	Ultimo|Yayinstal	phixnay	- Too late, I went ahead and restarted the whole thing.
2007-05-02T07:08:00.000Z	phixnay	Ultimo|Yayinstal	lol that works too
2007-05-02T07:10:00.000Z	Ultimo|Yayinstal	phixnay	- Aha, there we go. Turns out it was just bad luck, and now I've got wireless internet via a USB dongle! Thankies much for the patience and help!
2007-05-02T07:11:00.000Z	phixnay	Ultimo|Yayinstal	I'm glad I could help. I remember when I first started linux, ndiswrapper was the hardest thing for me : )
