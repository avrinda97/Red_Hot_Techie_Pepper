2009-05-15T04:43:00.000Z	super_hoops		i'm getting this error when i boot my pc "grub loading stage 1.5. grub loading please wait error 17"
2009-05-15T04:43:00.000Z	mzz	super_hoops	"error 17" is mapped to an actual error message in the grub manual.
2009-05-15T04:44:00.000Z	mzz	super_hoops	looked it up for you: "Cannot mount selected partition", "returned if the partition requested exists, but the filesystem type cannot be recognized by GRUB."
2009-05-15T04:44:00.000Z	mzz	super_hoops	iirc that usually means the boot partition changed, and reinstalling grub is usually the quickest fix
2009-05-15T04:45:00.000Z	mzz	super_hoops	(the "boot partition" being the one grub itself is on, which may or may not be the same as your root partition)
2009-05-15T04:46:00.000Z	mzz	super_hoops	see the "RestoreGrub" thing ubottu gave you
2009-05-15T04:46:00.000Z	mzz	super_hoops	iirc those instructions work for more than just windows overwriting it.
2009-05-15T04:53:00.000Z	mzz	super_hoops	where are you typing this, exactly? In a grub running inside ubuntu, or in a grub running natively?
2009-05-15T04:54:00.000Z	mzz	super_hoops	hmm, sec
2009-05-15T04:55:00.000Z	mzz	super_hoops	I just haven't had to mess with grub recently
2009-05-15T04:55:00.000Z	mzz	super_hoops	trying to remember if you have to mount your root partition inside ubuntu first
2009-05-15T04:56:00.000Z	mzz	super_hoops	actually, can you just try that? exit that grub prompt, make sure your partition is mounted (you can see /media/whatever/boot/grub/stage1), then try grub again
2009-05-15T05:01:00.000Z	mzz	super_hoops	I have no idea what "merged them together" means in partition magic. Also, please stay on the channel, but include my nick.
2009-05-15T05:03:00.000Z	super_hoops	mzz	sorry, new to all this lol.  basically when i installed ubuntu it was supposed to go to the G: partition that i'd created...but for some reason it created a new partition i: and installed to that but it only created a partition large enough to install linux and not enough to actually install any updates etc.  so i formatted both G & i partitions and joined them together to form one G partition. this is what has caus
2009-05-15T05:04:00.000Z	mzz	super_hoops	"formatted both G & I partitions" sounds like "erased all of linux" to me
2009-05-15T05:04:00.000Z	mzz	super_hoops	am I missing something?
2009-05-15T05:07:00.000Z	mzz	super_hoops	if your ubuntu partition is still there you should be able to mount it through the livecd. If you can not or if that partition is now empty you'll have to reinstall ubuntu (or run the "repair" option from a windows install cd to get windows to boot again)
2009-05-15T05:09:00.000Z	super_hoops	mzz	so it's just fixboot and fixmbr that i run in the xp recovery?
2009-05-15T05:09:00.000Z	mzz	super_hoops	those would make windows boot again, iiuc.
2009-05-15T05:10:00.000Z	mzz	super_hoops	if you did indeed format all linux partitions you've lost grub and would have to reinstall to get it back
2009-05-15T05:11:00.000Z	super_hoops	mzz	yeah i just wanna get into windows so i can back everything up then format and just go full linux instead of messing with both os'
