2008-09-22T23:47:00.000Z	Charles_F		Help with root terminal anyone?
2008-09-22T23:48:00.000Z	Charles_F		Anyone help with root terminal?
2008-09-22T23:49:00.000Z	Charles_F		I can't get sudo to work
2008-09-22T23:50:00.000Z	tobor_	Charles_F	do you get the box that asdks you for your password?
2008-09-22T23:50:00.000Z	Charles_F	bobertdos	I can't update and when I try to use sudo it tells me the sudoers file is screwed
2008-09-22T23:51:00.000Z	Charles_F		now when I try to shutdown the shutdown button frezes and I have to ctrl alt backspace to kill the x session
2008-09-22T23:52:00.000Z	Charles_F		I can't get a root terminal when i start in recovery mode cos it asks for the root password and... No i don't remember it
2008-09-22T23:52:00.000Z	Charles_F		the first line is wrong it says passprompt
2008-09-22T23:52:00.000Z	Charles_F		but I can't get to it to edit it
2008-09-22T23:52:00.000Z	tobor_	Charles_F	or you could boot to single user mode (requires no password) and reset the root password to whatever you want
2008-09-22T23:53:00.000Z	Charles_F		I know so why is is asking for one?
2008-09-22T23:53:00.000Z	Charles_F		tobor how?
2008-09-22T23:53:00.000Z	tobor_	Charles_F	the sudo dialog is asking fot your user password
2008-09-22T23:53:00.000Z	Charles_F		tobor I know but it doesn't like the password
2008-09-22T23:54:00.000Z	tobor_	Charles_F	whne you powercyle the system, press the ltter e when you see the grub menu.

2008-09-22T23:55:00.000Z	tobor_		colin its easier to just type "single" at the end of the line
2008-09-22T23:55:00.000Z	Charles_F		when I see the grub menu it allows me to select recovery mode but then I get this blue screen
2008-09-22T23:55:00.000Z	Charles_F		and that doesn't let me drop to root terminel
2008-09-22T23:55:00.000Z	tobor_	Charles_F	see the URL: I just posted
