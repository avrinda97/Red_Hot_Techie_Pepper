2005-04-08T12:25:00.000Z	christian		does someone now how to install my WLAN card D-Link DWL-610?
2005-04-08T12:26:00.000Z	gratuit	christian	I have a dlink installed using ndiswrapper
2005-04-08T12:28:00.000Z	gratuit	christian	did you use the driver included on the cd?
2005-04-08T12:29:00.000Z	christian	gratuit	no i didnt use the driver from the cd, i downloaded a driver
2005-04-08T12:30:00.000Z	gratuit	christian	and when you run ndiswrapper -l, what do you see?
2005-04-08T12:31:00.000Z	gratuit	christian	try using the driver that was included on the cd
2005-04-08T12:36:00.000Z	christian	gratuit	i get an error when i try to install the driver from the cd
2005-04-08T12:38:00.000Z	gratuit	christian	well, if the card is atheros based,(use lspci to find out) then there is a native kernel module out there written for it, I've never used it but I'm pretty sure you could find it on google
2005-04-08T12:41:00.000Z	christian	gratuit	i have installed the driver from the cd now, but it still does not show in system-admin-networking
2005-04-08T12:41:00.000Z	gratuit	christian	what does ndiswrapper -l give you now?
2005-04-08T12:42:00.000Z	gratuit	christian	hmm, when I do that I see 'neta3ab driver present, hardware present'
2005-04-08T12:43:00.000Z	gratuit	christian	you did modprobe ndiswrapper right?
2005-04-08T12:43:00.000Z	christian	gratuit	yes
2005-04-08T12:44:00.000Z	gratuit	christian	sorry, no idea
2005-04-08T12:45:00.000Z	christian	gratuit	do i need to restart after i installed th driver?
2005-04-08T12:45:00.000Z	gratuit	christian	no
2005-04-08T12:46:00.000Z	gratuit	christian	like I pasted a while back, ndiswrapper detected that my hardware was present, so if it's not showing that to you, I think that's your problem
2005-04-08T12:49:00.000Z	christian	gratuit	the hardware is present, it works in windows....
2005-04-08T12:49:00.000Z	gratuit	christian	I believe you, but ndiswrapper wasn't reporting it when you did 'ndiswrapper -l'
2005-04-08T12:51:00.000Z	christian	gratuit	so you have no idea what i can do
2005-04-08T12:54:00.000Z	christian	gratuit	i can see the wlan card in device manager, but it stands dwl-510, not dwl-610
