2006-02-20T11:14:00.000Z	Razor-X	Mordof	*glare* I use the console in X.
2006-02-20T11:18:00.000Z	Razor-X	Mordof	You'll get kicked if you complain *too* much, meh.
2006-02-20T11:18:00.000Z	Razor-X	Mordof	What have you tried insofar?
2006-02-20T11:19:00.000Z	Mordof	Razor-X	ive tried reinstalling drivers 4 times, ive tried dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, ive tried to edit my xorg.conf manually... ummmm, ive downlaoded some other packages for it (nvidia-glx) and did a sudo apt-get install, not sure for what atm
2006-02-20T11:20:00.000Z	Razor-X	Mordof	What would a dpkg-reconfigure or xorg.conf hacking do? Meh. Shouldn't.
2006-02-20T11:20:00.000Z	Razor-X	Mordof	Have you tried installing the official files?
2006-02-20T11:20:00.000Z	Mordof	Razor-X	yes, thats what i mean by the drivers
2006-02-20T11:20:00.000Z	Mordof	Razor-X	the official installer wont work
2006-02-20T11:20:00.000Z	Razor-X	Mordof	What's the error?
2006-02-20T11:20:00.000Z	Mordof	Razor-X	its installed on the old kernel, needs to be recompiled
2006-02-20T11:21:00.000Z	Mordof	Razor-X	so i got the correct gcc version, and the kernel header files for this kernel, and the installer worked perfectly
2006-02-20T11:21:00.000Z	Razor-X	Mordof	Then what?
2006-02-20T11:21:00.000Z	Razor-X	Mordof	By the way, did you have to pass anything special to the installer to get it to build?
2006-02-20T11:21:00.000Z	Mordof	Razor-X	then X wont start, and i have to do dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg to even get into X
2006-02-20T11:21:00.000Z	Mordof	Razor-X	no
2006-02-20T11:22:00.000Z	Razor-X	Mordof	After that, what?
2006-02-20T11:22:00.000Z	Mordof	Razor-X	X starts, with many login glitches, and i have no video support... no screensavers working, nothing 3d at all or anything
2006-02-20T11:22:00.000Z	Razor-X	Mordof	Hmmm...., what card are you using?
2006-02-20T11:23:00.000Z	Mordof	Razor-X	just bough t a new 6800xt
2006-02-20T11:24:00.000Z	Mordof	Razor-X	last install i did, it worked perfect when i installed the driver before i updated the kernel.... the updated kernel didnt complain
2006-02-20T11:25:00.000Z	Razor-X	Mordof	Uhhhh... not sure, sorry :\.
