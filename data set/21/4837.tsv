2008-03-01T04:14:00.000Z	Gibb		So theres no way to get a list of my symlinks?
2008-03-01T04:16:00.000Z	Slart	Gibb	symlinks are just files.. they can be all over your system.. why do you want a list of them all?
2008-03-01T04:16:00.000Z	Gibb	Slart	I have a problem with my usplash not displaying and a forum post said to check your symlinks
2008-03-01T04:17:00.000Z	Slart	Gibb	oh.. my usplash haven't been working for a year or so.. I just turned it off... I don't really know what symlinks they might be talking about... but ask the room about how to fix usplash instead.. you might get better answers that way
2008-03-01T04:17:00.000Z	Gibb	Slart	ah, howd you turn it off? Id rather do that
2008-03-01T04:18:00.000Z	Slart	Gibb	hmm.. run this in a terminal "gksu gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst". you should get a text editor window with the config file for grub
2008-03-01T04:19:00.000Z	Gibb	Slart	ok, I can swing that. What do I edit out to get rid of the graphical usplash?
2008-03-01T04:19:00.000Z	Slart	Gibb	hang on.. I have to check my own file here...
2008-03-01T04:20:00.000Z	Gibb	Slart	thx
2008-03-01T04:21:00.000Z	Slart	Gibb	somewhere about halfway to the end there is a line that starts with ## additional options to use with the default boot option.. and a couple of lines further down you have # defoptions ....  right?
2008-03-01T04:22:00.000Z	Slart	Gibb	can you paste the line that starts with # defoptions
2008-03-01T04:22:00.000Z	Gibb	Slart	yeah defoptions=quiet splash
2008-03-01T04:22:00.000Z	Slart	Gibb	ok.. just remove the "splash" part.. and voila.. no more splash
2008-03-01T04:23:00.000Z	Gibb	Slart	cool, so the line should be # defoptions=quiet? the # stays in front?
2008-03-01T04:23:00.000Z	Slart	Gibb	correct
2008-03-01T04:23:00.000Z	Gibb	Slart	thank you. Do I have to edit the menu.lst~ file as well? someone in here said that yesterday for another issue
2008-03-01T04:24:00.000Z	Slart	Gibb	so save the file.. and then run this in a terminal to make the changes take effect.. "sudo update-grub"
2008-03-01T04:24:00.000Z	Slart	Gibb	nah.. ~files in linux are usually backups
2008-03-01T04:24:00.000Z	Slart	Gibb	good thing to have if you mess something up..
2008-03-01T04:24:00.000Z	Gibb	Slart	great, you rule. thanks again. anything else after sudo update-grub?
2008-03-01T04:24:00.000Z	Slart	Gibb	nope.. you're done
