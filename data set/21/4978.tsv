2011-09-18T08:27:00.000Z	terr	ActionParsnip	I'm serious.  Carmine runs a geophysical shop and he just hauls out the old drives and sticks them on a shelf.

2011-09-18T08:28:00.000Z	terr	ActionParsnip	backup isn't really the problem.  Getting the data into the HDD"s is the problem.

2011-09-18T08:29:00.000Z	terr	ActionParsnip	he jsut installed a 128 cpu system
2011-09-18T08:30:00.000Z	terr	ActionParsnip	I gathered that.
2011-09-18T08:31:00.000Z	terr	ActionParsnip	I had to laugh.. their 128 cpu box was too loud.  So they went to Home Depot and bought a garden sehd.  Then they had to insulate it.  Then they had to go buy an A/C for their shed - which is in the office!
