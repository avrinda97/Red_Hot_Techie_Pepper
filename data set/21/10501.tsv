2005-02-17T13:18:00.000Z	pvh		From what I've read on the internet, the "advanced" features of my laptop's touchpad should Just Work, but none of them are enabled? What gives?
2005-02-17T13:19:00.000Z	chrissturm	pvh	you need to add the synaptic driver
2005-02-17T13:19:00.000Z	pvh	chrissturm	Okay, cool. That sounds pretty simple.
2005-02-17T13:20:00.000Z	pvh	chrissturm	apt-get install synaptic-driver, or such?
2005-02-17T13:20:00.000Z	chrissturm	pvh	should already be installed
2005-02-17T13:21:00.000Z	chrissturm	pvh	ls /usr/share/doc/xfree86-driver-synaptics
2005-02-17T13:21:00.000Z	pvh	chrissturm	I'll check.
2005-02-17T13:21:00.000Z	chrissturm	pvh	i hope that path is correct, i am using hoary, and there its: ls /usr/share/doc/xorg-driver-synaptics
2005-02-17T13:21:00.000Z	pvh	chrissturm	Yes, I'm also using hoary.
2005-02-17T13:22:00.000Z	pvh	chrissturm	The laptop support is so much more developed.
2005-02-17T13:22:00.000Z	pvh	chrissturm	Yes, I have it.
2005-02-17T13:22:00.000Z	pvh	chrissturm	Which is not a great sign...
2005-02-17T13:22:00.000Z	chrissturm	pvh	yeah, and powermanagement is great
2005-02-17T13:22:00.000Z	pvh	chrissturm	I had a nightmare of a time getting that set up.
2005-02-17T13:23:00.000Z	pvh	chrissturm	Okay, so I have it installed. Maybe my xorg.conf is wrong?
2005-02-17T13:23:00.000Z	chrissturm	pvh	you need to paste some codesnippet into your xorg.conf.
2005-02-17T13:23:00.000Z	pvh	chrissturm	Would that be in the readme?
2005-02-17T13:23:00.000Z	pvh	chrissturm	Stupid question, I can probably figure out myself.
2005-02-17T13:24:00.000Z	pvh	chrissturm	Is there a better idiom than "gunzip -c <file>.gz | less"
2005-02-17T13:24:00.000Z	chrissturm	pvh	vi file
2005-02-17T13:24:00.000Z	pvh	chrissturm	haha
