2007-07-11T07:46:00.000Z	shiester_miester	younghacker	index.blah. the file extension can be whatever you want, for example on my website its .php
2007-07-11T07:47:00.000Z	shiester_miester	younghacker	.htm or .html would both work
2007-07-11T07:58:00.000Z	shiester_miester	younghacker	have you put a link to it in the index page

2007-07-11T08:00:00.000Z	shiester_miester	younghacker	you dont have to put the link "in apache" :/
2007-07-11T08:00:00.000Z	shiester_miester	younghacker	well then the link in that file should point the browser to the other file
