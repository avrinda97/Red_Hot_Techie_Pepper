2011-12-13T01:17:00.000Z	Kurdistan		hey. I justed switched from distro x to ubuntu. I saved my home directery. now I can not make any changes does folder/file
2011-12-13T01:17:00.000Z	Kurdistan		only read/watch/listen but can not delete etc
2011-12-13T01:17:00.000Z	Kurdistan		how can I make myself the owner?
2011-12-13T01:18:00.000Z	AndChat-	Kurdistan	sudo chown -R $USER:$USER $HOME
2011-12-13T01:23:00.000Z	AndChat-	Kurdistan	what is easier than one command?
2011-12-13T01:26:00.000Z	AndChat-	Kurdistan	well yeah, you are running the file browser as root so permissions aren't an issue. Your user will still not be able to save data until it is the owner of its own $HOME
2011-12-13T01:28:00.000Z	AndChat-	Kurdistan	to make the OS work, you will need to run EVERYTHING with gksudo which I am very sure is longer and harder (sic) than one command
2011-12-13T01:29:00.000Z	AndChat-	Kurdistan	once more. The command you need is:   sudo chown -R $USER:$USER $HOME
2011-12-13T01:30:00.000Z	AndChat-	Kurdistan	run that and you will have significantly fewer problems
2011-12-13T01:30:00.000Z	AndChat-	Kurdistan	$USER and $HOME will change for you
2011-12-13T01:31:00.000Z	Kurdistan	AndChat-	it did not work.
2011-12-13T01:31:00.000Z	AndChat-	Kurdistan	it did, that will happen
2011-12-13T01:31:00.000Z	Kurdistan	AndChat-	okey. I will see.
2011-12-13T01:32:00.000Z	AndChat-	Kurdistan	try things now as you expect
2011-12-13T01:32:00.000Z	Kurdistan	AndChat-	:) thx dude.
2011-12-13T01:32:00.000Z	Kurdistan	AndChat-	it worked.
2011-12-13T01:32:00.000Z	AndChat-	Kurdistan	i did tell you ;-)
2011-12-13T01:33:00.000Z	Kurdistan	AndChat-	you saved me a lot of time.
2011-12-13T01:33:00.000Z	AndChat-	Kurdistan	the ownerships were all out of whack, you just set the owner to your user in ubuntu
2011-12-13T01:34:00.000Z	AndChat-	Kurdistan	its the quick way from earlier, remember?
2011-12-13T01:34:00.000Z	Kurdistan	AndChat-	true.
