2005-07-18T13:38:00.000Z	FlannelKing	firebird619	that's your problem, get more repos
2005-07-18T13:38:00.000Z	firebird619	FlannelKing	How do I do that. I have no Internet on Ubuntu
2005-07-18T13:39:00.000Z	FlannelKing	firebird619	you'll have to download them on another machine, and then sneakernet them over
2005-07-18T13:39:00.000Z	firebird619	FlannelKing	Do you have those files that it says that I am missing.
2005-07-18T13:40:00.000Z	firebird619	FlannelKing	Where do I download them from?
2005-07-18T13:42:00.000Z	FlannelKing	firebird619	what are you doing that you need the header files for?
2005-07-18T13:42:00.000Z	firebird619	FlannelKing	installing my modem
2005-07-18T13:43:00.000Z	firebird619	FlannelKing	I found a post on the forums on how to install my modem and except for those 2 files, installation went fine.
2005-07-18T13:43:00.000Z	FlannelKing	firebird619	which post?
2005-07-18T13:44:00.000Z	firebird619	FlannelKing	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=36762&highlight=Modems
2005-07-18T13:44:00.000Z	FlannelKing	firebird619	you need the kernel headers, I'll bet that will include those files
2005-07-18T13:45:00.000Z	FlannelKing	firebird619	the "make sure you have gcc and linux-headers for the version youre running" line at the beginning, did you do that?
2005-07-18T13:45:00.000Z	firebird619	FlannelKing	I have the headers installed from Synaptic, I would think they would be there already.
2005-07-18T13:45:00.000Z	firebird619	FlannelKing	I also have gcc installed
2005-07-18T13:46:00.000Z	FlannelKing	firebird619	headers installed from synaptec? and it says youre missing which files?
2005-07-18T13:46:00.000Z	firebird619	FlannelKing	The only repository I have is the Install CD
2005-07-18T13:47:00.000Z	firebird619	FlannelKing	it says I am missing the files:   /boot/vmlinuz.autoconf.h and /boot/vmlinuz.version.h
2005-07-18T13:47:00.000Z	FlannelKing	firebird619	what package in synaptec did you install (the header one)
2005-07-18T13:48:00.000Z	firebird619	FlannelKing	for headers I have linux-headers-2.6.10-5,   linux-headers-2.6.10-5-386,    and linux-headers-386 installed
2005-07-18T13:50:00.000Z	firebird619	FlannelKing	I also have linux-kernel-headers installed
