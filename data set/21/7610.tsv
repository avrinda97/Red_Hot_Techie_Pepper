2006-09-21T08:50:00.000Z	FRET		in the file /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/05aptitude I have this: aptitude::Keep-Unused-Pattern "^linux-image.*$ | ^linux-restricted-modules.*$";. WHY???
2006-09-21T08:51:00.000Z	sproingie	FRET	so you can go back to an older kernel if the new one fries on you
2006-09-21T08:51:00.000Z	FRET	sproingie	but somehow I cannot install the new kernel with aptitude, only with the graphical package manager.
2006-09-21T08:52:00.000Z	FRET	sproingie	is that normal?
2006-09-21T08:52:00.000Z	sproingie	FRET	that's odd, considering they read from the same package list. i have the opposite problem, the graphical update thingie doesn't install packages anymore
2006-09-21T08:53:00.000Z	FRET	sproingie	nice :-)
2006-09-21T08:53:00.000Z	FRET	sproingie	but you don't have any solution for it now?
2006-09-21T08:53:00.000Z	sproingie	FRET	nope, it should definitely be appearing in aptitude too
2006-09-21T08:54:00.000Z	FRET	sproingie	it does appear in aptitude, but is not installed. Aptitude says it won't install it
2006-09-21T08:55:00.000Z	sproingie	FRET	it should tell you why it won't install it if you hit return on the package
2006-09-21T08:55:00.000Z	sproingie	FRET	there most likely be a package in red
2006-09-21T08:56:00.000Z	FRET	sproingie	I'm talking about aptitude in a shell
2006-09-21T08:56:00.000Z	sproingie	FRET	oh just from the command line?  try running the curses gui and find the package and drill down into it
2006-09-21T08:56:00.000Z	sproingie	FRET	most likely you need to update and dist-upgrade
2006-09-21T08:57:00.000Z	FRET	sproingie	no... I like command-line package-management. There should be no need for a gui. I'll have another try...
2006-09-21T08:58:00.000Z	sproingie	FRET	then figure out the appropriate apt-* command.  otherwise just use the gui that makes it obvious
2006-09-21T08:58:00.000Z	FRET	sproingie	alright...
2006-09-21T09:00:00.000Z	FRET	sproingie	dist-upgrade works... :-)
2006-09-21T09:01:00.000Z	sproingie	FRET	that gave you the new kernel?
2006-09-21T09:01:00.000Z	FRET	sproingie	right. linux-image-2.6.15-27-386
2006-09-21T09:02:00.000Z	sproingie	FRET	excellent.  i personally use the curses gui all the time, makes updates much easier to review.  i just hit u, U, and g
