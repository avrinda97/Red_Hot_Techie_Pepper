2012-01-08T19:58:00.000Z	StepNjump		what does it mean when I type exit to get out of a CLI terminal, I get there are stop jobs.. Which jobs?
2012-01-08T20:00:00.000Z	StepNjump		Cuz I was back to the prompt
2012-01-08T20:02:00.000Z	StepNjump		ok llutz jobs... good command
2012-01-08T20:02:00.000Z	quiescens	StepNjump	type: jobs
2012-01-08T20:03:00.000Z	StepNjump		but lets say llutz I run cp and then when it goes back to the prompt then I assume it's finished copying right? so after that, is it ok to type exit?
2012-01-08T20:03:00.000Z	quiescens	StepNjump	fg to make one of them active again
2012-01-08T20:03:00.000Z	StepNjump		yes quiescens that√®s what llutz just said... I had never heard that one before
2012-01-08T20:03:00.000Z	quiescens	StepNjump	they should only happen if you press ctrl-z to stop whatever was running when you pressed ctrl-z
2012-01-08T20:04:00.000Z	StepNjump		oh cool quiescens tn
2012-01-08T20:04:00.000Z	StepNjump		tnx
2012-01-08T20:05:00.000Z	StepNjump	quiescens	that's the thing I never pressed ctrl z
2012-01-08T20:06:00.000Z	quiescens	StepNjump	sorry, my mistake, there are other things that cause it, if you run something with & which then decides it needs to wait for input
2012-01-08T20:07:00.000Z	StepNjump		no, not even that quiescens
2012-01-08T20:08:00.000Z	quiescens	StepNjump	well, what did "jobs" say that are still running?
2012-01-08T20:11:00.000Z	StepNjump		let me try it quiescens
2012-01-08T20:13:00.000Z	StepNjump	quiescens	it says: man ls  (wd: ~/.weechat/logs) but those two processes are running in separate tabs!
2012-01-08T20:14:00.000Z	quiescens	StepNjump	shrugs
2012-01-08T20:15:00.000Z	StepNjump		I might need to reboot
2012-01-08T20:15:00.000Z	StepNjump		but I learned something new thanks to llutz and you, quiescens
2012-01-08T20:15:00.000Z	quiescens	StepNjump	type fg
2012-01-08T20:15:00.000Z	quiescens	StepNjump	to bring a stopped job back to the front
