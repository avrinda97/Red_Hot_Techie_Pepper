2007-07-23T11:41:00.000Z	dumbalien		genii:would it be better to use sata card in pci slot 33mhz or ide ata-100
2007-07-23T11:42:00.000Z	dumbalien		a dell dimension 4400, PIII 2ghz
2007-07-23T11:43:00.000Z	dumbalien		genii:asked on the forum about RAID card, someone said unless you spend 500 it only software?
2007-07-23T11:44:00.000Z	XLV	dumbalien	yeah, most cards below 250$ are software raid

2007-07-23T11:44:00.000Z	XLV	dumbalien	but you can find some older pci hardware sata raid used for less
2007-07-23T11:45:00.000Z	dumbalien	XLV	so do i need a sta card or a sata RAID card
2007-07-23T11:45:00.000Z	XLV	dumbalien	though the system will be held back by the pci bandwidth, only 133MB/s, or 266MB/s if your mb and controller support 66mhz/32bit pci
2007-07-23T11:46:00.000Z	dumbalien		genii:sounds good
2007-07-23T11:46:00.000Z	XLV	dumbalien	if you want to run software raid, then get a sata pci card, and use linux software raid, if you want true hardware raid, get some promise controller, they start at 300$ or so, or then go to 3ware, areca etc they start at 400-500$
2007-07-23T11:47:00.000Z	dumbalien		genii:so really, i need to upgrade everything
2007-07-23T11:47:00.000Z	XLV	dumbalien	most sata cards claim they do raid, but if they dont have a xor engine on board, its just software raid, so scrap it and use software raid of linux, which is much more flexible
2007-07-23T11:47:00.000Z	dumbalien		XLV:ok, i will stick with the cheaper option as the box is so old
2007-07-23T11:47:00.000Z	XLV	dumbalien	unless you are going to dual boot with windows
2007-07-23T11:48:00.000Z	dumbalien	XLV	does dual booting windows confuse things?
2007-07-23T11:48:00.000Z	XLV	dumbalien	try finding something used, i have seen pci sata cards with 4 sata connectors for 10-15$ new.. via chip on board
2007-07-23T11:49:00.000Z	XLV	dumbalien	yeah, cause then windows wont be able to see the raid array
2007-07-23T11:49:00.000Z	XLV	dumbalien	then you'll have to use the raid function of the card, and use dmraid
2007-07-23T11:49:00.000Z	dumbalien	XLV	ah
2007-07-23T11:49:00.000Z	XLV	dumbalien	theres a solution in any case, dmraid
2007-07-23T11:50:00.000Z	dumbalien	XLV	thanks for the info
