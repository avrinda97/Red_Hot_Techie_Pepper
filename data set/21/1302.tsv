2011-06-06T15:20:00.000Z	nit-wit	gul	thanks hold on.
2011-06-06T15:22:00.000Z	nit-wit	gul	you just need the sdc hard drive before the other two HD in the bios, and to reload grub2 to work.
2011-06-06T15:23:00.000Z	gul	nit-wit	on sda Xp is there, on sdb ARCH is installed and this is what I want to recover, on sdc ubuntu is installed 9my external HDD)
2011-06-06T15:24:00.000Z	gul	nit-wit	so how to do it?
2011-06-06T15:24:00.000Z	nit-wit	gul	I'm mostly familiar with grub2 not grub-legacy.
2011-06-06T15:25:00.000Z	gul	nit-wit	so there is some difference in two??? Ok ummm any solution?
2011-06-06T15:26:00.000Z	gul	nit-wit	is it possible to boot into sdb with sdc?
2011-06-06T15:26:00.000Z	nit-wit	gul	huge differences, I can't really help you with the onboard grub, I just never worked on grub-legacy
2011-06-06T15:27:00.000Z	gul	nit-wit	thanks!
2011-06-06T15:27:00.000Z	nit-wit	gul	yes you need to have the sdc dive before the others in the bios and then reload grub to point at the sdc5 not sdc1, I can give you a link or the commands.
2011-06-06T15:32:00.000Z	gul	nit-wit	on sdc Ubuntu is installed and it lists windows from sda also.....so can it show ARCH from sdb ?
2011-06-06T15:34:00.000Z	nit-wit	gul	If you want the sdc dive to boot the internal hd put the sdc first to be read in the bios and reload grub from a natty live cd with this link. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Copy%20LiveCD%20Files
2011-06-06T15:35:00.000Z	nit-wit	gul	I have to crash good luck.;)
