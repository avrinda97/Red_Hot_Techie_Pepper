2007-10-06T13:41:00.000Z	dbft		umm rexy_...
2007-10-06T13:41:00.000Z	dbft		on the "application"?
2007-10-06T13:41:00.000Z	dbft		for example ifi want to webcam to feed into flash
2007-10-06T13:42:00.000Z	dbft		ah ok i'll take a look Zenerek :)
2007-10-06T13:42:00.000Z	dbft		so it will work with a number of applications which accept webcams
2007-10-06T13:44:00.000Z	dbft		noo Flannel - maybe im explaining badly
2007-10-06T13:45:00.000Z	dbft		say i have a file abc.avi and want it to stream AS IF IT IS A WEBCAM
2007-10-06T13:45:00.000Z	dbft		into flash, or amsn, or pidgin - or whatever
2007-10-06T13:45:00.000Z	dbft		so there is no physical webcam in this situation
2007-10-06T13:47:00.000Z	dbft		i'm googling now ,was just hoping someone here would know - its possible on windows
2007-10-06T13:48:00.000Z	javaJake	dbft	you'd have to find something that would output a video to /dev/video or /dev/video2
2007-10-06T13:48:00.000Z	javaJake	dbft	yes
2007-10-06T14:00:00.000Z	javaJake	dbft	lemme see here...
2007-10-06T14:02:00.000Z	javaJake	dbft	I don't believe it... I think I just figured it out...
2007-10-06T14:03:00.000Z	javaJake	dbft	mplayer with driver v4l or v4l2... lemme look at this some more
2007-10-06T14:07:00.000Z	javaJake	dbft	augh, nvm
2007-10-06T14:07:00.000Z	javaJake	dbft	the drivers mentioned are for input only
2007-10-06T14:08:00.000Z	javaJake	dbft	wait, you want to broadcast a video?
2007-10-06T14:08:00.000Z	javaJake	dbft	in an IM window?
2007-10-06T14:09:00.000Z	javaJake	dbft	perhaps there is another way for this flash app?
2007-10-06T14:09:00.000Z	javaJake	dbft	Ah, I see, I see
