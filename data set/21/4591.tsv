2008-03-26T03:38:00.000Z	yowshi		is it possible to get two hard drives to mount to thre same folder? like i have an ntfs formatted harddrive and a ext3 partition i would like both to be mounted to ~/home-data. is this possible and if so how
2008-03-26T03:39:00.000Z	azexia2	yowshi	i have that in effeect, i have two dirs, but i sym link all of one to another, so that it seems fromt he outside it's all one large dir, would that work?
2008-03-26T03:40:00.000Z	yowshi	azexia2	i dont understand what symlinking really is yet much less know how to do it
2008-03-26T03:40:00.000Z	azexia2	yowshi	very simple, just think of it as a shortcut, but on a network share it would be invisible
2008-03-26T03:43:00.000Z	azexia2	yowshi	if you want to symlink two things, you can just click and drag, then when the menu comes up, click 'make symbolic link' or you can do ln -s dir/file1 dir2, that would put a link of dir/file1 in dir2
2008-03-26T03:43:00.000Z	yowshi	azexia2	thanks
2008-03-26T03:43:00.000Z	azexia2	yowshi	no problem =)
2008-03-26T03:44:00.000Z	yowshi	azexia2	when i drag and drop though no option to make a symlink is presentedc
2008-03-26T03:45:00.000Z	azexia2	yowshi	sorry, i assumed you were using ubuntu (standard) but we can do this at the command line very easily, do you know how to open it, becuase i'm not to sure on edubuntu :p
2008-03-26T03:45:00.000Z	yowshi	azexia2	i am using ubuntu 64
2008-03-26T03:46:00.000Z	yowshi	azexia2	i am not using kubuntu or any of the *buntu's
2008-03-26T03:46:00.000Z	azexia2	yowshi	fair enough, in that case let me just check, i jsut a variety of distros, and i tend to use the console for quick commands =)
2008-03-26T03:47:00.000Z	yowshi	azexia2	i can use the console method instead. i prefer guis because i tend to typo alot
2008-03-26T03:47:00.000Z	azexia2	yowshi	right click, make link, then drag the link to anywhere you like, that seemed to work, unfortunatly, you'd have to do that for everything inside dir2, to make dir 1 one partition
2008-03-26T03:48:00.000Z	azexia2	yowshi	the command is very easy, and it's very hard to get typos, you got the console open?
2008-03-26T03:49:00.000Z	yowshi	azexia2	as for typos i generally tend to make one typo per sentence i just catch and fix them sometimes so it looks like i make less
2008-03-26T03:50:00.000Z	azexia2	yowshi	hehe, easy to make mistakes, but the command would be: ln -s dir1/* dir2/ that would link everything from dir 1 to dir 2, obviously it would be longer if you have your windows dir in /media/ntfs or something, but it is a very short command =)
2008-03-26T03:50:00.000Z	yowshi	azexia2	thanks a bunc
2008-03-26T03:50:00.000Z	azexia2	yowshi	no problem at all, glad someone could help, don't think everyone resorts rtfm :P
2008-03-26T03:51:00.000Z	yowshi	azexia2	i know of at least 3 people now who dont do that. but it is infuriating when someone does that. especially since i am not a moron and tend to try a manual first
2008-03-26T03:52:00.000Z	azexia2	yowshi	irc does tend to be full of fast typists, i would love to hear the sounds of everyone at the same time =) but we are all lazy, it's very easy to point someone to a page, but most of the time people will try and help
