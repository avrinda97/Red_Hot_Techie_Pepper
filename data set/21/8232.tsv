2006-05-17T11:05:00.000Z	Gizmo_The_Great		Is it fair to say that no one can help regarding the WPA at the moment?
2006-05-17T11:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Gizmo_The_Great	 ive totally given up on wireless .... again. :P lol
2006-05-17T11:06:00.000Z	Gizmo_The_Great		lol
2006-05-17T11:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		My router can block based on MAC. wich is nice...
2006-05-17T11:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		but i never have gotten wireless working with linux, in a reliable fashion.
2006-05-17T11:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		actually its very Unrelisable under windows as well.
2006-05-17T11:07:00.000Z	Gizmo_The_Great	Dr_Willis	in my case it's seen the card OK (but as eth1) but I can't configure it to work with WPA (it seems to have WEP built in but not WPA) and the installation of wpasupplicant has not helped
2006-05-17T11:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Gizmo_The_Great	 many of the oklder wireless card can do WEP but not WPA
2006-05-17T11:07:00.000Z	Gizmo_The_Great		WPA is very hard to crACK
2006-05-17T11:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Gizmo_The_Great	 i have an old Laptop card that can only do WEP
2006-05-17T11:08:00.000Z	Gizmo_The_Great		Aaah, the laptop is about 3 years old. I wonder if that is it
2006-05-17T11:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Gizmo_The_Great	 that would be my guess
2006-05-17T11:08:00.000Z	Gizmo_The_Great		darn it to hell
2006-05-17T11:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		Heh - gee was i actually able to Help? :P wow.
2006-05-17T11:09:00.000Z	Gizmo_The_Great	Dr_Willis	cheers
