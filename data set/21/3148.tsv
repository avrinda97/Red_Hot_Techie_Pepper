2012-01-18T20:21:00.000Z	adom		so i installed dropbox from the .deb package from their site, how do i uninstall it so i can reinstall it?
2012-01-18T20:21:00.000Z	adom		is there like a -u flag for .deb files?
2012-01-18T20:23:00.000Z	iceroot	adom	dpkg -l \*dropbox\* | grep ^ii
2012-01-18T20:23:00.000Z	iceroot	adom	that will show you al packages installed with dropbox in the name
2012-01-18T20:24:00.000Z	adom	iceroot	nautilus-dropbox comes up
2012-01-18T20:25:00.000Z	iceroot	adom	then hat package is installed
2012-01-18T20:25:00.000Z	adom	iceroot	so if its installed, why cant i apt-get purge it?
2012-01-18T20:26:00.000Z	iceroot	adom	what is the output of "apt-get remove --purge nautilus-dropbox"
2012-01-18T20:26:00.000Z	iceroot	adom	why should that not work?
2012-01-18T20:27:00.000Z	adom	iceroot	LjL: that did some good. nautilus-dropbox purged successfully. however, my problem was always with the daemon not running. ill see if that works now on reinstall.
2012-01-18T20:30:00.000Z	adom	iceroot	LjL Pici: before i attempt to reinstall from .deb pkg, should i first do "dpkg -r dropboxpkg.deb"?
2012-01-18T20:30:00.000Z	iceroot	adom	not dpkg -r foo.deb  just dpkg -r foo
2012-01-18T20:31:00.000Z	iceroot	adom	when "dpkg -l \*dropbox*\ | grep ^ii is not showing anything dropbox is not installed
2012-01-18T20:33:00.000Z	adom	iceroot	LjL Pici : when i open downloaded 32bit .deb file for dropbox, Software Center is saying "Sorry, 'nautilus-dropbox' is not available for this type of computer (i386)" but i KNOW this is a 32bit machine
2012-01-18T20:34:00.000Z	iceroot	adom	output of "dpkg --print-architecture"
2012-01-18T20:34:00.000Z	adom	iceroot	i386
2012-01-18T20:34:00.000Z	iceroot	adom	ok then its 32bit
2012-01-18T20:34:00.000Z	iceroot	adom	output of "sudo apt-get install nautilus-dropbox"
2012-01-18T20:35:00.000Z	adom	iceroot	E: Unable to locate package nautilus-dropbox
2012-01-18T20:35:00.000Z	iceroot	adom	output of "cat /etc/issue" and "cat /etc/apt/sources.list"
2012-01-18T20:36:00.000Z	iceroot	adom	what are you doing exactly?
