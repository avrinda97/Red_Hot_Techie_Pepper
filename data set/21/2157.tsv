2012-08-02T03:53:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	elfMobile	avs is windows, there is unstable port thought
2012-08-02T03:54:00.000Z	elfMobile	brontosaurusrex	yeah.... it would be a pain for this.... finding the rights spot in each video.  If I'm just joining and cutting I could use ffmpeg.  avs script was fun because it could do other things like slow mo, etc
2012-08-02T04:20:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	elfMobile	ffmpeg ?
2012-08-02T04:21:00.000Z	elfMobile	brontosaurusrex	already have ffmpeg installed
2012-08-02T04:23:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	elfMobile	basically someplayer thatscript pipe ffmpeg some commands
2012-08-02T04:32:00.000Z	elfMobile	brontosaurusrex	hmm... I saw the script output option.... but the script just calls a render program..... it doesn't seem to be using pipes
2012-08-02T04:32:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	elfMobile	the easy way to export to something uncompressed and then use ffmpeg on that
2012-08-02T04:34:00.000Z	elfMobile	brontosaurusrex	ouch... I have the space so why not ;-)
2012-08-02T04:35:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	elfMobile	thats dumbproof method, also people always want some weird formats at the end, so you can always just take that fat master
2012-08-02T04:36:00.000Z	elfMobile	brontosaurusrex	what is a good uncompressed format?
2012-08-02T04:36:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	elfMobile	what options do you have? fv1?
2012-08-02T04:37:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	elfMobile	dnxhd might be good intermediate as well
2012-08-02T04:38:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	elfMobile	otherwise: on win; ut-video (ffmpeg has decoder i think), mac; prores 444, 422, animation rle rgb, ffmpeg; x264 lossless or slightly lossy, there is plenty of them
2012-08-02T04:38:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	elfMobile	that are slightly lossy or really lossless
2012-08-02T04:39:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	elfMobile	this are all final formats, perhaps you could hacksor around h.264 , all depends on your sources really
2012-08-02T04:40:00.000Z	elfMobile	brontosaurusrex	..... oh Lossless / HQ was a separate selection.  I see FFV1 lossless (video) + FLAC (sound)
2012-08-02T04:40:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	elfMobile	that will work
2012-08-02T04:40:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	elfMobile	go for ffv1
2012-08-02T04:42:00.000Z	elfMobile	brontosaurusrex	thanks for the help
2012-08-02T04:42:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	elfMobile	you want latest x264 and ffmpeg (from git)
2012-08-02T04:42:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	elfMobile	no problem
