2007-08-08T16:44:00.000Z	dgeorge		hey guys is there going to be any way to use the bbc iplayer with linux
2007-08-08T16:45:00.000Z	dgeorge		I think its awesome that you can go and download the shows but can't do it if you have linux
2007-08-08T16:46:00.000Z	Pelo	dgeorge	 try bittorrent,  all the best bbc shows end up there
2007-08-08T16:57:00.000Z	Pelo	dgeorge	 you just need to go to a site that shows  wmv avi or mpg  videos
2007-08-08T05:24:00.000Z	Pelo	dgeorge	 google for  realplayer linux and dl the .bin installer, very easy
2007-08-08T05:25:00.000Z	Pelo	dgeorge	 ok,    open the terminal,  cd to the fodler with the file in it ,  then type   sudo chmod 777 fiklename.bin ,  then  sudo ./filename.bin
2007-08-08T05:28:00.000Z	Pelo	dgeorge	  sudo ./filename.bin    read carefully   it's sudo dotslachfinename.bin
2007-08-08T05:28:00.000Z	Pelo	dgeorge	 you are replacing filename with the actual name of the file right ?
2007-08-08T05:29:00.000Z	Pelo	dgeorge	  put a path in the home folder   like  /home/user/.realplayer
2007-08-08T05:32:00.000Z	dgeorge	Pelo	what do i put in for the prefix for symbolic links
2007-08-08T05:32:00.000Z	Pelo	dgeorge	 I hve no idea, it never asked me for that when I installed  leave the default if there is any
2007-08-08T05:32:00.000Z	Pelo	dgeorge	 I hve no idea, it never asked me for that when I installed  leave the default if there is any
2007-08-08T05:33:00.000Z	Pelo	dgeorge	congrats
2007-08-08T05:34:00.000Z	dgeorge	Pelo	does bbc radio one work on yours
2007-08-08T05:35:00.000Z	Pelo	dgeorge	 never tried but the little previews usualy do
2007-08-08T06:32:00.000Z	Pelo	dgeorge	 have a nice time
2007-08-08T06:33:00.000Z	Pelo	dgeorge	 just log off ,
2007-08-20T06:12:00.000Z	Pelo	dgeorge	try with synaptic if that doesn'T work    delete the flash files and folder from your hdd,   use the search engine in the places  menu and make sure you select to view hidden files as well
2007-08-20T06:18:00.000Z	Pelo	dgeorge	 enable all the repost,  mustliver and backport as well,  then just search for flash
2007-08-20T06:19:00.000Z	Pelo	dgeorge	oh, don'T think it is in the dapper repos you'll hve to get the one from the adobe site
2007-08-20T06:25:00.000Z	Pelo	dgeorge	clean iinstall is quiicker by a long shot,
