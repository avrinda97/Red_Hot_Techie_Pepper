2010-10-18T00:53:00.000Z	basix-		is there a good picture/video editing program for ubuntu? i am looking for something to compare with what mac offers
2010-10-18T00:55:00.000Z	SteelPangolin	basix-	Mac OS X has an image editor?
2010-10-18T00:57:00.000Z	SteelPangolin	basix-	ddilinger: so  basix- you're looking for something more like iLife than Final Cut?
2010-10-18T00:58:00.000Z	basix-	SteelPangolin	, yes iLife i was just going to search it on apple.com thanks..
2010-10-18T02:35:00.000Z	SteelPangolin	basix-	XBMC. Not just for cracked Xbox 1 systems any more.
2010-10-18T03:25:00.000Z	SteelPangolin	basix-	there is for Lucid, i think
2010-10-18T03:26:00.000Z	SteelPangolin	basix-	you might have to add Universe or Multiverse or some PPA
2010-10-18T03:26:00.000Z	SteelPangolin	basix-	is that Maverick? The XBMC web site mentioned that they don't have a Maverick package yet
2010-10-18T03:27:00.000Z	SteelPangolin	basix-	you could try booting from their LiveCD version to see if it's what you're looking for before trying to build it yourself or something
2010-10-18T03:28:00.000Z	basix-	SteelPangolin	it's just an app right?
2010-10-18T03:28:00.000Z	SteelPangolin	basix-	it's pretty heavyweight. It's an app, yes, and a whole bunch of plugins, support libs, AV codecs...
2010-10-18T03:29:00.000Z	SteelPangolin	basix-	even a customized dynamic linker/loader, although I don't think the non-Xbox versions need it any more
2010-10-18T03:30:00.000Z	basix-	SteelPangolin	i want a media center to connect to my main tv and be able to carry my entire library of dvd's and bd on a few hard drives
2010-10-18T03:31:00.000Z	SteelPangolin	basix-	yeah, i have a similar setup
2010-10-18T03:35:00.000Z	SteelPangolin	basix-	http://mirrors.xbmc.org/releases/live/ if you want to easily evaluate it
2010-10-18T03:35:00.000Z	SteelPangolin	basix-	those should have drivers for most of the hardware XBMC can talk to
2010-10-18T03:52:00.000Z	basix-	SteelPangolin	xbmc is exactly what i was looking for thanks :)
2010-10-18T03:59:00.000Z	SteelPangolin	basix-	try http://sabnzbd.org/
2010-10-18T04:00:00.000Z	basix-	SteelPangolin	ok thanks :) you should write a microsoft to linux software transitioning guide ;)
2010-10-18T04:03:00.000Z	SteelPangolin	basix-	there's probably a wiki page somewhere for Ubuntu, but http://www.opensourcewindows.org/ is a good place to start, since 99% of those projects have Linux versions
2010-10-18T04:03:00.000Z	basix-	SteelPangolin	k i'll check it out
