2007-12-03T03:11:00.000Z	htmldotcom1		ill get to it, lol
2007-12-03T03:13:00.000Z	htmldotcom1		so what I did was, I wanted to add KDE to my computer. I already added fluxbox with sudo apt-get install fluxbox, so I was in a good moode. SO then, I looked at a tutorial. It said "sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop" would do it. So I did that. My computer started being really slow, so I did a Ctrl+Alt+Backspace. Now, I can't even get to the login screen.
2007-12-03T03:13:00.000Z	htmldotcom1		someone please help.
2007-12-03T03:13:00.000Z	danbhfive	htmldotcom1	did you let the install finish?
2007-12-03T03:16:00.000Z	danbhfive	htmldotcom1	you can type top on a terminal to see what is running
2007-12-03T03:18:00.000Z	htmldotcom1	danbhfive	I have to go into recovery terminal to have any access at all.
2007-12-03T03:20:00.000Z	htmldotcom1	danbhfive	irssi is really nice
2007-12-03T03:22:00.000Z	danbhfive	htmldotcom1	did you try the top command?  That will tell you what is eating away at your cpu
2007-12-03T03:25:00.000Z	danbhfive	htmldotcom1	why dont you just remove kubuntu-desktop?
2007-12-03T03:36:00.000Z	htmldotcom1	danbhfive	yes I do need help still
2007-12-03T03:36:00.000Z	danbhfive	htmldotcom1	so, is your computer still running slow?  or is just not working?
2007-12-03T03:37:00.000Z	danbhfive	htmldotcom1	can you get to a terminal?
2007-12-03T03:37:00.000Z	htmldotcom1	danbhfive	yes, the recovery root terminal
2007-12-03T03:38:00.000Z	danbhfive	htmldotcom1	ok, try sudo apt-get install -f
2007-12-03T03:38:00.000Z	htmldotcom1	danbhfive	-f? what does that do?
2007-12-03T03:38:00.000Z	danbhfive	htmldotcom1	i think it means force.  Basically, it will try to install any packages that previously failed to install
2007-12-03T03:39:00.000Z	htmldotcom1	danbhfive	ok. I also want to mention that I did a sudo apt-get remove kubuntu-desktop, and I removed it.
2007-12-03T03:40:00.000Z	htmldotcom1	danbhfive	but it only removed about 50 KB worth of data, while the fill kde install was about 500 MB worth of data
2007-12-03T03:41:00.000Z	danbhfive	htmldotcom1	ok, well, let me know if the command did anything, also, you can run sudo apt-get autoremove
