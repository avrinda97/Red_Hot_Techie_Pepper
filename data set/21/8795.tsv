2006-01-22T17:19:00.000Z	CanYouHelpMePlz		can anyone help me convert an avi to mpeg2 ?
2006-01-22T17:21:00.000Z	dradul	CanYouHelpMePlz	you should be able to convert it with wither ffmpeg (in the Universe repo) or mplayer (in the Multiverse repo)
2006-01-22T17:21:00.000Z	dradul	CanYouHelpMePlz	I recommend you try with ffmpeg first.
2006-01-22T17:22:00.000Z	CanYouHelpMePlz	dradul	whats the command i use with ffmpeg to go from avi to mpeg2 ?
2006-01-22T17:34:00.000Z	dradul	CanYouHelpMePlz	sorry for the interruption (the joys of using Dapper ;-)
2006-01-22T17:35:00.000Z	CanYouHelpMePlz	dradul	i still need to either burn a vcd from my .avi or convert it to mpeg2..
2006-01-22T17:35:00.000Z	dradul	CanYouHelpMePlz	thry this ffmpeg -i yourvid.avi -target ntsc-svcd /tmp/svcd.mpg
2006-01-22T17:35:00.000Z	CanYouHelpMePlz	dradul	ok thanks
2006-01-22T17:38:00.000Z	CanYouHelpMePlz	dradul	thanks it's encoding now
2006-01-22T17:39:00.000Z	dradul	CanYouHelpMePlz	do note that there are many options to have better quality transcoding. Read the manual page (man ffmpeg). I'd go for at leat adding  "-sameq -pass 2" and "-acodec raw" if the original sound is in mp3.
2006-01-22T17:39:00.000Z	CanYouHelpMePlz	dradul	i see, so should i stop it now?
2006-01-22T17:39:00.000Z	dradul	CanYouHelpMePlz	probably so, if you want good quality ;-)
2006-01-22T17:40:00.000Z	CanYouHelpMePlz	dradul	ok
2006-01-22T17:41:00.000Z	CanYouHelpMePlz	dradul	i get Unknown codec 'raw'
2006-01-22T17:42:00.000Z	dradul	CanYouHelpMePlz	so ignore that entry. The sound will not change much in quality (because it will be reencoded at 200 Kbps
2006-01-22T17:43:00.000Z	CanYouHelpMePlz	dradul	where do i add those entries?
2006-01-22T17:44:00.000Z	CanYouHelpMePlz	dradul	should it look like this? ffmpeg -i /home/pete/Stuff/Downloads/Azureus/hostel/Hostel.avi -sameq -pass 2 -target ntsc-svcd  /home/pete/Stuff/hostel.mpg
2006-01-22T17:45:00.000Z	dradul	CanYouHelpMePlz	I was quoting from memory, the command to copy the soundtrack is "-acodec copy"
2006-01-22T17:45:00.000Z	CanYouHelpMePlz	dradul	what should my command look like please,? ffmpeg -i /home/pete/Stuff/Downloads/Azureus/hostel/Hostel.avi -sameq -pass 2 -target ntsc-svcd  /home/pete/Stuff/hostel.mpg
2006-01-22T17:48:00.000Z	CanYouHelpMePlz	dradul	got it working.
2006-01-22T17:48:00.000Z	CanYouHelpMePlz	dradul	thanks
