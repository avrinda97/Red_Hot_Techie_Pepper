2009-12-19T16:58:00.000Z	epinky	subsam	look at line 9, that's your VGA adapter: "VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Mobile 4 Series Chipset Integrated Graphics Controller"

2009-12-19T16:59:00.000Z	subsam	epinky	what doed it mean ?
2009-12-19T17:00:00.000Z	epinky	subsam	I think it's an integrated Video Card from Intel and it's Mobile 4 series :)
2009-12-19T17:02:00.000Z	subsam	epinky	why it not apper in hardware drivers ?
2009-12-19T17:02:00.000Z	epinky	subsam	 I think it's just a standard VGA, it should be listed as Generic or something like that, in the other hand lspci is very eloquent
