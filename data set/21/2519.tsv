2009-09-18T22:08:00.000Z	cheater99		hey guys, i'm trying to compile cdctl from source (there's no package), but i think it's missing ucdrom.h - where can i get it? i untarred it, did ./configure and then make install but make install failed because of unknown constants..
2009-09-18T22:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cheater99	 Hmm.. not in any support/dev package in the normal packages it seems
2009-09-18T22:11:00.000Z	cheater99	Dr_Willis	aha
2009-09-18T22:12:00.000Z	cheater99	Dr_Willis	any ideas friend?
2009-09-18T22:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cheater99	 other then suggest google, and the docs for the program. It may mention some other support stuff you need.
2009-09-18T22:13:00.000Z	cheater99	Dr_Willis	i wasn't able to locate ucdrom.h either..
2009-09-18T22:16:00.000Z	cheater99	Dr_Willis	i've found the header in a debian package - one is for 'woody' and one for 'sarge' - which one is better?
2009-09-18T22:36:00.000Z	cheater99	Dr_Willis	thx
2009-09-24T17:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cheater99	 ddrescue tries very very very hard to get all the data it can.. doing several reads if needed.
2009-09-24T17:17:00.000Z	cheater99	Dr_Willis	cd audio has an error correcting code as well which is scattered around the disc. i wouldn't like bits to be marked as the wrong value because the extraction tool did not check the checksum and instead had to guess what the bit was..
2009-09-24T19:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cheater99	 install the 'ccsm' tool and tweak it all you want
2009-09-24T19:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cheater99	 then start exploring that amazingly complex   config tool. :)
2009-09-24T19:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cheater99	 no idea. I tend to turn off most everything...
2009-09-24T19:51:00.000Z	cheater99	Dr_Willis	my problem is that i turned off the effect, but it's still on..
2010-06-20T18:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cheater99	 installed as in compiled by hand? for personal use /home/username/bin  or /opt/bin or /usr/local/bin
2010-06-20T18:37:00.000Z	cheater99	Dr_Willis	for the use of everyone on the system including root
2010-06-20T18:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cheater99	 /usr/local/bin then
2010-06-20T18:38:00.000Z	cheater99	Dr_Willis	cool. why not /usr/bin ? what is that dir for?
2010-06-20T18:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cheater99	 user made stuff not from the package manager..  should be in  a 'local' or /opt type dir to keep it seperate
2010-06-20T18:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cheater99	 i have sevarl programs that installed to /opt/
2010-06-20T18:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cheater99	 its not from the normal repos/packages
