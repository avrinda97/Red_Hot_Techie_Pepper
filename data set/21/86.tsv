2012-09-30T07:36:00.000Z	Smackbook		i was trying to change from gdm back to lightdm by dpkg-reconfigure gdm, and now when I reboot x doesnt start at all when I reboot.  tail /var/log/dmesg ends in "init: gdm main process killed by TERM signal".  any suggestions?
2012-09-30T07:38:00.000Z	lobhater	Smackbook	 what is the output when you try to restart lightdm?
2012-09-30T07:38:00.000Z	Smackbook	lobhater	how do I do that?
2012-09-30T07:39:00.000Z	lobhater	Smackbook	  sudo service lightdm restart
2012-09-30T07:41:00.000Z	Smackbook	lobhater	it just swtiches back to terminal 7 and shows those final terminal boot messages (starting daemons etc)
