2006-06-01T08:36:00.000Z	ray__		hello, i'm still having trouble getting svideo out to work with my nvidia card. i used the following url: http://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/1.0-8762/README/appendix-g.html
2006-06-01T08:37:00.000Z	ray__		would someone be willing to look at my xorg.conf to see if i've done it right?
2006-06-01T08:38:00.000Z	ray__		would you give me the url to pastebin?
2006-06-01T08:38:00.000Z	ray__		!info pastebin
2006-06-01T08:38:00.000Z	ray__		!pastebin
2006-06-01T08:39:00.000Z	ray__		!tell ray__ about pastebin
2006-06-01T08:39:00.000Z	ray__		hmmm
2006-06-01T08:39:00.000Z	intelikey	ray__	pastebin it and we'll have a look.
2006-06-01T08:45:00.000Z	intelikey	ray__	mmmm no v4l in the modules ?
2006-06-01T08:45:00.000Z	ray__	intelikey	v4l?
2006-06-01T08:46:00.000Z	ray__	intelikey	what is v4l? i've never heard of that
2006-06-01T08:48:00.000Z	intelikey	ray__	i'm not 'sure' you need v4l to get that to work.   but  apt-cache search v4l
2006-06-01T08:49:00.000Z	intelikey	ray__	was v4l not an option in the modules section of your config ?
2006-06-01T08:50:00.000Z	ray__	intelikey	that doesn't seem to be what i need. nvidia drivers should work just fine
2006-06-01T08:51:00.000Z	intelikey	ray__	other than the missing v4l  i don't see any thing that looks  amiss
2006-06-01T08:52:00.000Z	ray__	intelikey	say i dl'ed v4l-conf, would i specify something in xorg.conf myself?
2006-06-01T08:53:00.000Z	intelikey	ray__	and like i said.  i don't know that you need it,  but you can try adding    section "Module"   load  v4l
2006-06-01T08:54:00.000Z	ray__	intelikey	one more question: everytime i save the xorg.conf file, do i have to restart?
2006-06-01T08:55:00.000Z	intelikey	ray__	issue  sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
2006-06-01T11:23:00.000Z	intelikey	ray__	yeah tty7 is the default location for X
2006-06-01T11:24:00.000Z	intelikey	ray__	alt+left-arrow  is a surefire way to find a running X from the console.... it switches one tty left each press.
