2005-07-31T10:39:00.000Z	mgcross		is firefox fixed yet? I'd like to get some extensions but I get get past the new version available page!
2005-07-31T10:39:00.000Z	mgcross		arg
2005-07-31T10:41:00.000Z	mgcross		anyone?
2005-07-31T10:41:00.000Z	bob2	mgcross	presumably the latest security release fixes it
2005-10-04T07:30:00.000Z	bob2	mgcross	get rid of it and use the ubuntu version
2005-10-04T07:30:00.000Z	mgcross	bob2	is that going to fix the problem?
2005-10-04T07:30:00.000Z	bob2	mgcross	who knows, but it's a start to debug it
2005-10-04T07:31:00.000Z	mgcross	bob2	I'm just making a guess that that was what caused this mess..
2005-10-04T07:31:00.000Z	mgcross	bob2	true, true
2005-10-04T07:31:00.000Z	mgcross	bob2	how the heck do I rid myself of it?
2005-10-04T07:31:00.000Z	bob2	mgcross	yay for installing things from outside ubuntu
2005-10-04T07:31:00.000Z	bob2	mgcross	perhaps #nvidia knows
2005-10-04T07:32:00.000Z	mgcross	bob2	yah, I know, I know....the Ubuntu driver is dead old tho...lol
2005-10-04T07:32:00.000Z	bob2	mgcross	not really
2005-11-20T07:03:00.000Z	bob2	mgcross	then wait and perhaps someone will jump up
2005-11-20T07:04:00.000Z	bob2	mgcross	better still would be asking your question already
2005-11-20T07:04:00.000Z	mgcross	bob2	I'll try to be patient ;-D
2005-11-20T07:05:00.000Z	mgcross	bob2	k, I can play just fine, but when I try to start a listen server I get a signal 11
2005-11-20T07:05:00.000Z	mgcross	bob2	I'd really like to be able to play with/against my son
2005-11-26T09:24:00.000Z	bob2	mgcross	this sounds like a camera or card problem, not an ubuntu one
2005-11-26T09:24:00.000Z	bob2	mgcross	tho I'd not recommend using mkfs on anything you want a camera to use
