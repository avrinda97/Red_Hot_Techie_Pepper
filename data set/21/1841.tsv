2010-04-25T15:40:00.000Z	CloudLevi		Good luck trying to get a clue as to how FURIOUS I AM!!!
2010-04-25T15:40:00.000Z	CloudLevi		HOW do I make WINE WORK!?!!?
2010-04-25T15:42:00.000Z	CloudLevi		Har har, Iceroot. Piece of junk won't take half the programs I throw at it, I'm TRYING to follow this wonderful little guide and now...wellllllllll the guide has apparently installed things WRONG and in such a way that they keep me from being -able- to REinstall them
2010-04-25T15:44:00.000Z	tatsel	CloudLevi	Then I suggest you to take a walk outside and come back asking when you will be calmed down
2010-04-25T16:17:00.000Z	CloudLevi	tatsel	???
2010-04-25T16:18:00.000Z	tatsel	CloudLevi	hm?
2010-04-25T16:18:00.000Z	CloudLevi	tatsel	Play On Linux???
2010-04-25T16:18:00.000Z	tatsel	CloudLevi	yes. <
2010-04-25T16:18:00.000Z	CloudLevi	tatsel	I don't suppose I'd be able to do something about SC2 with that
2010-04-25T16:19:00.000Z	tatsel	CloudLevi	Beta is Beta
2010-04-25T16:19:00.000Z	CloudLevi	tatsel	...What about it? >>;
2010-04-25T16:19:00.000Z	CloudLevi	tatsel	I have the beta installer.
2010-04-25T16:19:00.000Z	tatsel	CloudLevi	besides, Linux is a Comunity, it takes time for such kind of support to be added
2010-04-25T16:19:00.000Z	CloudLevi	tatsel	Wha...?
2010-04-25T16:20:00.000Z	tatsel	CloudLevi	and since this is the beta, first, I must admit I am jaleous :D
2010-04-25T16:20:00.000Z	CloudLevi	tatsel	I don't even know what Play On Linux is... ><;;; also I'm not -IN- the beta. x_X; I just have the program...
2010-04-25T16:20:00.000Z	tatsel	CloudLevi	second: You will have better luck with the final game.
2010-04-25T16:21:00.000Z	CloudLevi	tatsel	I'll have more luck on Windows =-=;;; *stores the installer away, flips off Wine, and goes about his business*
2010-04-25T16:21:00.000Z	tatsel	CloudLevi	but as I saud earlier, PlayOnLinux is a more user-friendly interface to Wine, and it configures wine to works a lot easier
2010-04-25T16:22:00.000Z	CloudLevi	tatsel	Ubuntu is cool and all but really...this machine isn't even WORTH the frustrati- What is it a patch or something?
2010-04-25T16:24:00.000Z	tatsel	CloudLevi	http://playonlinux.com
