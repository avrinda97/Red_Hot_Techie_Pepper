2011-09-05T13:26:00.000Z	alex-		What's wrong with Gnome 2?
2011-09-05T13:27:00.000Z	auronandace	alex-	what do you mean?
2011-09-05T13:27:00.000Z	alex-	auronandace	why is unity the default interface?
2011-09-05T13:28:00.000Z	auronandace	alex-	ask the decision makers
2011-09-05T13:28:00.000Z	alex-	auronandace	who are they?
2011-09-05T13:28:00.000Z	auronandace	alex-	gnome2 is being depreciated anyway (i use xfce so it's a non-issue for me)
2011-09-05T13:33:00.000Z	alex-	auronandace	why is it depriated?
2011-09-05T13:34:00.000Z	auronandace	alex-	it is no longer supported by the gnome people (they are concentrating on gnome3)
2012-05-15T00:40:00.000Z	auronandace	alex-	11.04 already has gnome2, why do you want mate?
2012-05-15T00:40:00.000Z	alex-	auronandace	To install  the Mint menu
2012-05-15T00:41:00.000Z	auronandace	alex-	have you considered, oh i don't know, using mint instead?
2012-05-15T00:41:00.000Z	alex-	auronandace	I don't want to loose my current ubuntu installation
2012-05-15T00:42:00.000Z	auronandace	alex-	well mate isn't supported here
2012-05-15T00:42:00.000Z	auronandace	alex-	the mate devs
2012-05-15T00:43:00.000Z	auronandace	alex-	you do understand what "not supported" means?
2012-05-15T00:43:00.000Z	alex-	auronandace	So I don't really see how MATE devs could help with this
2012-05-15T00:44:00.000Z	auronandace	alex-	trying to install mate on a system that already has gnome2 will break things
2012-05-15T00:44:00.000Z	alex-	auronandace	Ye I know now, I'm looking for a way how to fix
2012-05-15T00:45:00.000Z	auronandace	alex-	you don't break it in the first place
2012-05-15T00:46:00.000Z	auronandace	alex-	if you know it isn't supported and you know it breaks the system then why did you install it?
2012-05-15T00:47:00.000Z	auronandace	alex-	you can't really fix it from here, you need to reinstall afresh
