2007-03-10T16:00:00.000Z	Theory5		hey i just installed Ubuntu server edition but when i started it up GRUB loaded, how do i get to use the desktop?
2007-03-10T16:00:00.000Z	Jowi	Theory5	you install an xserver
2007-03-10T16:01:00.000Z	Jowi	Theory5	"ubuntu-desktop" contain everything you need including gnome.
2007-03-10T16:01:00.000Z	Jowi	Theory5	or you can install xserver + any other wm
2007-03-10T16:02:00.000Z	Jowi	Theory5	here's a few examples for you https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/LowMemorySystems
2007-03-10T16:02:00.000Z	Jowi	Theory5	"sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop" but check the previous link i gave you first to see if that might suite you better
2007-03-10T16:06:00.000Z	Jowi	Theory5	either 1. download the desktop (a live cd) or the alternative (text basexd installer cd) cd image. or: 2. boot your system, login and type "sudo apt-get update" and "sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop"
2007-03-10T16:15:00.000Z	Jowi	Theory5	what error did you get?
2007-03-10T16:17:00.000Z	Jowi	Theory5	try "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" to set up the drivers/monitor/keyboard/mouse. then try again.
2007-03-10T16:18:00.000Z	Jowi	Theory5	did you recieve any error when you installed ubuntu-desktop?
2007-03-10T16:21:00.000Z	Jowi	Theory5	what error did you get exactly when trying to start gdm?
2007-03-10T16:22:00.000Z	Jowi	Theory5	so ubuntu-desktop was not installed properly. try this again: "sudo apt-get update" and then "sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop"
2007-03-10T16:22:00.000Z	Jowi	Theory5	do not do anything while it is installing
2007-03-10T16:29:00.000Z	Jowi	Theory5	download the desktop or alternate cd. that might suit you better and save you from headache if you're new to the system.
2007-03-10T16:30:00.000Z	Jowi	Theory5	generally the server cd is more advanced
2007-03-10T16:30:00.000Z	Jowi	Theory5	from http://www.ubuntu.com
2007-03-10T16:47:00.000Z	Jowi	Theory5	that's the screensaver. press space and you will get your screen back.
2007-03-11T16:58:00.000Z	Jowi	Theory5	"sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start" or if ubuntu-desktop installed properly this time - reboot
2007-03-11T16:58:00.000Z	Jowi	Theory5	then you will get a graphical log in screen
2007-03-11T06:00:00.000Z	Jowi	Theory5	by default the server install installs the bare minimum neccessary to run servers. to serve webpages you need to install a web server. (like apache2 or lighttpd)
