2011-12-07T07:42:00.000Z	Tubuktu		yes
2011-12-07T07:42:00.000Z	Tubuktu		!hostname
2011-12-07T07:42:00.000Z	Tubuktu		i can use hostname tukuktunew
2011-12-07T07:43:00.000Z	Tubuktu		nice
2011-12-07T07:43:00.000Z	Tubuktu		doesnt say if it needs reboot
2011-12-07T07:43:00.000Z	jtokarchuk	Tubuktu	 as ActionParsnip said, you should to cover all of your bases.
2011-12-07T07:49:00.000Z	jtokarchuk	Tubuktu	Python sounds like the answer
2011-12-07T07:50:00.000Z	jtokarchuk	Tubuktu	and out of curiousity, why with the random hostnames?
2011-12-07T07:51:00.000Z	Tubuktu	jtokarchuk	it would go well with macchanger or each boot to have a random mac + random hostname = complete anonymity
2011-12-07T07:52:00.000Z	Tubuktu	jtokarchuk	could i use perl for that or python is the best bet?
2011-12-07T07:53:00.000Z	jtokarchuk	Tubuktu	you can use whatever you want, you would read each line of text (one hostname per line) into an array, and pick a random array[x] number
2011-12-07T07:54:00.000Z	Tubuktu	jtokarchuk	how can it be random? should i use a pseudorandom number generator?
2011-12-07T07:55:00.000Z	jtokarchuk	Tubuktu	^^
2011-12-07T07:56:00.000Z	Tubuktu	jtokarchuk	k nice. so i guess random is a function of python which uses /dev/random ? or its on RNG
2011-12-07T07:57:00.000Z	jtokarchuk	Tubuktu	it uses a RNG
2011-12-07T07:58:00.000Z	Tubuktu	jtokarchuk	PRNG
2011-12-07T07:58:00.000Z	jtokarchuk	Tubuktu	 yes, but as I said you can use whatever language fits you. Why is anonymity so important?
