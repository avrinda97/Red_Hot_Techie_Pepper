2010-05-21T07:23:00.000Z	Loshki	shazbotmcnasty	because his network is fried on Ubuntu...
2010-05-21T07:24:00.000Z	Loshki	shazbotmcnasty	:-)
2010-05-21T07:33:00.000Z	Loshki	shazbotmcnasty	ubottu has an entry for chicken?
2010-05-21T07:33:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	Loshki	nope
2010-07-09T06:12:00.000Z	Loshki	shazbotmcnasty	what exactly are you trying to do?
2010-07-09T06:12:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	Loshki	rip a dvd as an iso
2010-07-09T06:17:00.000Z	Loshki	shazbotmcnasty	dd should work but I find you need to specify block size, count and conv=notrunc to get a faithful copy. Also, converting to avi is time consuming, and you will lose quality by going to/from avi format. If you're getting read errors from the disk, it's because it's damaged or needs cleaning. Try using windex on it.
2010-07-09T06:19:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	Loshki	what would you suggest for block size, count, etc
2010-07-09T06:20:00.000Z	Loshki	shazbotmcnasty	please stop typing enter so much. Let me look at my script and see how it does it...
2010-07-09T06:21:00.000Z	Loshki	shazbotmcnasty	first, I type: isoinfo -d -i /dev/sr0
2010-07-09T06:24:00.000Z	Loshki	shazbotmcnasty	see the logical block size (almost always 2048) and the volume size (for my dvd, it's 3287649). Then do dd if=/dev/sr0 bs=2048 count=3287649 conv=notrunc > /disk/dvd.iso
2010-07-09T06:26:00.000Z	Loshki	shazbotmcnasty	yes, it comes from the  isoinfo -d -i /dev/sr0 command. It's the size of your dvd in blocks. It's different for every dvd
2010-07-09T06:27:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	Loshki	I got another IO error, and I already cleaned it off
2010-07-09T06:29:00.000Z	Loshki	shazbotmcnasty	it may be damaged, or scratched, or something. Some readers do better than others when performing error correction. Do you have a different drive you can try it with?
2010-07-09T06:30:00.000Z	Loshki	shazbotmcnasty	sounds like the disk itself is damaged. See if you can copy it using vobcopy, or dvdbackup.
