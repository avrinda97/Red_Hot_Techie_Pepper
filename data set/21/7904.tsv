2006-06-19T09:02:00.000Z	killaz		ok so know I need a firewall
2006-06-19T09:02:00.000Z	gnomefreak	killaz	why?
2006-06-19T09:03:00.000Z	killaz	gnomefreak	well dont think that's a good idea, my linux server was rootkitted a month ago.... an open port...
2006-06-19T09:03:00.000Z	gnomefreak	killaz	change the config of iptables than
2006-06-19T09:04:00.000Z	killaz	gnomefreak	dont want to do the iptables config myself....
2006-06-19T09:04:00.000Z	killaz	gnomefreak	I want to use the tools at hand to ease the work :p
2006-06-19T09:05:00.000Z	killaz	gnomefreak	on the server I installed shorewall... very nice
2006-07-09T07:13:00.000Z	killaz	gnomefreak	but before i do that maybe it's something that one of you guys know of...
2006-07-09T07:14:00.000Z	gnomefreak	killaz	that just ask your question instead of asking where bugs get filed
2006-07-09T07:16:00.000Z	gnomefreak	killaz	where did it save the tar?
2006-07-09T07:17:00.000Z	killaz	gnomefreak	what do you mean where did it save the tar?
2006-07-09T07:17:00.000Z	gnomefreak	killaz	yes
2006-07-09T07:20:00.000Z	gnomefreak	killaz	than that is where you need to look for it
2006-07-09T07:21:00.000Z	killaz	gnomefreak	the problem is this: FileRoller doesnt show me the folders in the tar, that suppose to be there..
2006-07-09T07:21:00.000Z	gnomefreak	killaz	i dont use fileroller its easier for me to run the command ;)
2006-07-09T07:22:00.000Z	killaz	gnomefreak	it's not that I can not find the tar. I know where the tar is... but looking at the tar with FileRoller is the problem...
2006-07-09T07:22:00.000Z	gnomefreak	killaz	than use the tar command with xvzf and it will show you while unpacking it what is in there
2006-07-09T07:23:00.000Z	killaz	gnomefreak	like I said earlier after using tar zxvf the folders are extracted correctly... so I know the folders is in there...
2006-07-09T07:24:00.000Z	gnomefreak	killaz	it could be a setting in fileroller could be a bug could be anything file it as a bug but first make sure you are up2date
2006-07-09T07:24:00.000Z	killaz	gnomefreak	but still there are some ppl that use FileRoller all the time and some sometimes (like me) that want to bo sure tha ALL files in the tar is being extracedt
2006-07-09T07:26:00.000Z	killaz	gnomefreak	File Roller 2.12.1 is the latest stable version.... and Ubuntu ships with 2.14.3-0ubuntu
