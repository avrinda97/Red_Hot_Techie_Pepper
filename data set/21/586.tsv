2011-09-12T02:36:00.000Z	VampsWin7		can anyone tell me what i would search for to find, install and add the launching icons to the dock/launcher/menu bar?
2011-09-12T02:36:00.000Z	escott	VampsWin7	alacarte
2011-09-12T02:36:00.000Z	VampsWin7	escott	: is that a package making things easy to use?
2011-09-12T02:40:00.000Z	VampsWin7	escott	: think you may have misunderstood what i was looking for.. let me try to reword it. I am lookin for something to allow me to add remove and find the "applets" like sound, networks, and the like to the menu/dock/launcher
2011-09-12T02:40:00.000Z	escott	VampsWin7	start them first, then right click on the icon and pin it
2011-09-12T02:44:00.000Z	VampsWin7	escott	: when you open the add to panel what is the name of the objects you are adding
2011-09-12T02:45:00.000Z	escott	VampsWin7	im assuming you are running unity, and that you start the application from the "Windows Key Menu", then on the left panel you can right click the icon for the running application and keep it on the panel
2011-09-12T02:47:00.000Z	VampsWin7	escott	L i'm runing Ubuntu CLassic. i'm refering to when you right click on the Menu bar and the submenu allows you to add what i believe is applets, but that's what i'm tryin to figure out.
2011-09-12T02:47:00.000Z	escott	VampsWin7	for classic i think you want to add a "launcher" applet
2011-09-12T02:49:00.000Z	VampsWin7	escott	: not a launcher, i want to find more of the packages like trash bin, desktop switcher, network setup, email notify, and the link
2011-09-12T02:49:00.000Z	escott	VampsWin7	i guess make sure that the gnome-applets package. its been a long time since ive used classic. sorry
2011-09-12T02:50:00.000Z	VampsWin7	escott	: understandable. so the icons left in the dock for trash bin and desktop switcher are called applets?
2011-09-12T02:51:00.000Z	escott	VampsWin7	yes
2011-09-12T02:51:00.000Z	VampsWin7	escott	: is there a way to easily search for different applets that are available?
2011-09-12T02:52:00.000Z	VampsWin7	escott	: SMP makes it a little tricky to find them easily.
2011-09-12T02:52:00.000Z	escott	VampsWin7	it should list them all when you click on the panel. verify that you are right clicking on the panel itself and not on an applet in the panel. if your panel is full it may be hard to find a pixel that will get you the panel menu instead of an applet
2011-09-12T02:53:00.000Z	VampsWin7	escott	: correct that does work, but is there a resource to find others that are out there? like the Package Managers does .
2011-09-12T02:55:00.000Z	escott	VampsWin7	most of the more popular ones should be packaged up, but they dont generally come individually
2011-09-12T02:56:00.000Z	VampsWin7	escott	: aww ok, thanks. the snypatic package manager will still find others that exist either mainstream or otherwise correct?
2011-09-12T02:57:00.000Z	escott	VampsWin7	no you would have to compile non-packaged applets from source. I'm not sure where you can find them
2011-09-12T02:57:00.000Z	VampsWin7	escott	: got ya now. thanks for the info.
