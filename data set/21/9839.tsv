2005-10-01T05:17:00.000Z	bimberi	oggah	backports has a later version, might only be 1.4 tho
2005-10-01T05:17:00.000Z	bimberi	oggah	on and if you do enable backports, disable them after you install (see /topic)
2005-12-12T17:42:00.000Z	bimberi	oggah	there are packages in breezy-backports now
2005-12-12T17:43:00.000Z	oggah	bimberi	kay.
2005-12-12T17:45:00.000Z	bimberi	oggah	http://packages.ubuntu.com/breezy-backports/
2005-12-12T17:48:00.000Z	oggah	bimberi	some of the packages listed at the backports-list. are marked [universe]  what, does that mean? and the packages not marked? whats specific with them?
2005-12-12T17:49:00.000Z	bimberi	oggah	unmarked packages are probably in main, universe is free software that is community (but not canonical) supported
2005-12-12T17:51:00.000Z	oggah	bimberi	aight. thanks.
2005-12-12T17:51:00.000Z	bimberi	oggah	np :)

2005-12-12T06:09:00.000Z	oggah	bimberi	found a _really_ nice opera-icon at kde-look.org :D
2005-12-12T06:12:00.000Z	bimberi	oggah	looks good! :)
2005-12-12T06:14:00.000Z	bimberi	oggah	no - but have a look at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ApacheMySQLPHP
2005-12-12T06:28:00.000Z	bimberi	oggah	... or wait for someone else to backport it
2005-12-12T08:08:00.000Z	bimberi	oggah	set up some shortcuts via System -> Prefs -> Keyboard Shorcuts (at the bottom)
