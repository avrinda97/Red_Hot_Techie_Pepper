2005-02-13T12:14:00.000Z	Fazer	eyequeue	What's the root password on the Live CD?
2005-02-13T12:15:00.000Z	eyequeue	Fazer	 there is not one, root is not a ubuntu thing really
2005-02-13T12:15:00.000Z	eyequeue	Fazer	 root is also disabled if you install ubuntu
2005-02-13T12:30:00.000Z	eyequeue	Fazer	 rhymes with freebird
2005-02-13T12:31:00.000Z	eyequeue	Fazer	 firefox/thunderbird/sunbird :: web/email/calendar
2005-04-23T10:21:00.000Z	eyequeue	Fazer	 both i and the laptop i'm typing this on think it is :)  i don't know about that particular one of course
2005-04-23T10:24:00.000Z	eyequeue	Fazer	 ndiswrapper-utils - Userspace utilities for ndiswrapper
2005-04-23T10:27:00.000Z	eyequeue	Fazer	 apt-get install ndiswrapper-utils
2005-04-23T10:27:00.000Z	Fazer	eyequeue	Ah, thanks.  I will do that if I can get Haory to be installed on my lappy.
2005-04-23T10:28:00.000Z	eyequeue	Fazer	 ah, you're new.  any time someone says a command that you need to be root for, prepend a sudo in front.  like:
2005-04-23T10:28:00.000Z	eyequeue	Fazer	 sudo et install ndiswrapper-utils
2005-04-23T10:28:00.000Z	eyequeue	Fazer	 sudo apt-get install ndiswrapper-utils
2005-04-23T10:28:00.000Z	Fazer	eyequeue	Ah yeah, thanks a lot dude.
2005-04-23T10:29:00.000Z	eyequeue	Fazer	 sure thing, and welcome
2005-04-23T10:30:00.000Z	eyequeue	Fazer	 have a cd burner?  mailing will probably take weeks, much less than fetching the iso even by dialup :)
2005-04-23T10:30:00.000Z	Fazer	eyequeue	Haha yeah, I lack a CD burner =[
2005-04-23T10:30:00.000Z	eyequeue	Fazer	 gotcha
2005-04-23T10:37:00.000Z	eyequeue	Fazer	 xfce is much lighter weight, yes
2005-04-23T11:09:00.000Z	eyequeue	Fazer	 4.10?  is it the ppc version?
2005-04-23T11:10:00.000Z	Fazer	eyequeue	Oh no no, its for my Thinkpad 600E.
2005-04-23T11:11:00.000Z	Fazer	eyequeue	I basically get kernel panic error after the Live CD splashscreen appears.
