2011-06-07T22:05:00.000Z	rinkukokiri		I need a duplicate mp3 remover... anyone?
2011-06-07T22:06:00.000Z	Corey	rinkukokiri	Does it have to be graphical? :-)
2011-06-07T22:06:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	Corey	i would /prefer/ it be, but no.
2011-06-07T22:06:00.000Z	Corey	rinkukokiri	Otherwise I'd probably script something with find, awk, and sort / uniq -c. :-)
2011-06-07T22:07:00.000Z	Corey	rinkukokiri	http://embraceubuntu.com/2005/10/08/find-duplicate-copies-of-files/ seems to tsill be useful
2011-06-07T22:08:00.000Z	Corey	rinkukokiri	Looks like fslint is the GUI version.
2011-06-07T22:15:00.000Z	Corey	rinkukokiri	You sure about that?  This operates on a checksum basis. :-)
2011-06-07T22:18:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	Corey	wow... seems ubuntu has problems copying files from one drive to another then
2011-06-07T22:19:00.000Z	Corey	rinkukokiri	Unlikely. :-)
2011-06-07T22:19:00.000Z	Corey	rinkukokiri	md5sum the two files, does it spit out the same?
2011-06-07T22:19:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	Corey	i say that because on my mybook the files work.. after i copied them to my local filesystem they don't work
2011-06-07T22:20:00.000Z	Corey	rinkukokiri	How did you do the copy?
2011-06-07T22:20:00.000Z	Corey	rinkukokiri	I've had no issues doing similar things via scp and / or rsync.
2011-06-07T22:20:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	Corey	i right click > copy, right click > paste
2011-06-10T04:21:00.000Z	Corey	rinkukokiri	testdisk
2011-06-14T06:31:00.000Z	Corey	rinkukokiri	That's how we learn.
2011-06-23T05:58:00.000Z	Corey	rinkukokiri	Not helpful.
2011-06-23T05:59:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	Corey	you're right, uninstalling compiz and unity does nothing to correct my original issue.
2011-06-23T05:59:00.000Z	Corey	rinkukokiri	Neither does complaining about the OS-- that's what -offtopic is for.
2011-06-23T06:09:00.000Z	Corey	rinkukokiri	Yes, you don't like it.  Please stop slamming it here.
2011-06-23T06:10:00.000Z	rinkukokiri	Corey	me and Rexter  are having a conversation, sorry if it bothers you.
