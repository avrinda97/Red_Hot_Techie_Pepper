2005-05-29T13:47:00.000Z	Amaranth		you can't use synaptic to install java, you have to do it from a terminal
2005-05-29T13:48:00.000Z	Amaranth		since Sun licensed it how they did
2005-05-29T13:49:00.000Z	Amaranth		nope
2005-05-29T13:49:00.000Z	bigfoot	Amaranth	okay, but before installing Java, it must be downloaded first, right?
2005-05-29T13:49:00.000Z	Amaranth	bigfoot	yeah, from sun's website
2005-05-29T13:53:00.000Z	bigfoot	Amaranth	according to http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/Java, the best way to get an up-to-date Java installation is "Method 1: Use Sun Java packages prebuilt for Ubuntu." I'm a bit unsure of how to proceed now...
2005-05-29T13:53:00.000Z	Amaranth	bigfoot	Listen to the wiki then.
2005-05-29T13:54:00.000Z	bigfoot	Amaranth	hope you're not upset... I just wasn't sure what to do...
2005-05-29T13:55:00.000Z	Amaranth	bigfoot	I'm not, I just don't use java. :)
2005-05-29T15:22:00.000Z	Amaranth	bigfoot	What game?
2005-05-29T15:22:00.000Z	bigfoot	Amaranth	the game is called formido.
2005-05-29T15:23:00.000Z	bigfoot	Amaranth	i don't have a GDL hardware, so i download "corny" games.
2005-06-08T16:47:00.000Z	Amaranth	bigfoot	The ops hide now. :)
2005-06-09T05:55:00.000Z	Amaranth	bigfoot	nautilus is your desktop
2005-06-09T05:57:00.000Z	Amaranth	bigfoot	It is a file browser. Your desktop is just a nautilus window without a window border.
2005-06-09T05:58:00.000Z	bigfoot	Amaranth	but if i only have the desktop open (and no other Nautilus windows) it doesn't show up in top.
2005-06-09T05:58:00.000Z	Amaranth	bigfoot	There are more things running then top shows. Try ps -e
2005-06-09T05:59:00.000Z	Amaranth	bigfoot	or ps -ex is you want to be overwheled with data ;)
2005-06-09T06:00:00.000Z	bigfoot	Amaranth	but isn't it the same for you too?... that if you don't have any other Nautilus windows open, aside from desktop, it shouldn't show up in top or ps -e /ps -ex.
2005-06-09T06:01:00.000Z	Amaranth	bigfoot	no, it's showing as running for me. run 'ps -e | grep nautilus' to see
2005-06-09T06:02:00.000Z	bigfoot	Amaranth	i see.
