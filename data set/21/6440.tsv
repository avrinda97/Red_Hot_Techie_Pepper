2007-04-19T06:20:00.000Z	cry0		Hey, anybody know how to put breezy sources.list back to default?  I forgot to back it up...
2007-04-19T06:21:00.000Z	cry0		I was trying to upgrade... I'm in the process.  Thats how I screwed over my sources.list
2007-04-19T06:21:00.000Z	cry0		Tried that, it wont do anything
2007-04-19T06:22:00.000Z	cry0		Update-manager just says there is nothing to update
2007-04-19T06:22:00.000Z	cry0		er, actually now it just errors
2007-04-19T06:23:00.000Z	cry0		It has a lot of Couldn't stat source package list http://archive.ubuntu.com breezy/universe Packages (/var/lib/apt/lists/archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_breezy_universe_binary-i386_Packages) - stat (2 No such file or directory) errors

2007-04-19T06:26:00.000Z	cry0		How can I update breezy without update-manager or a working sources.list?
2007-04-19T06:27:00.000Z	cry0		So... what do I do if I screw over my sources.list?  Its trying to download from localhost...
2007-04-19T06:28:00.000Z	dc	cry0	just edit it?
2007-04-19T06:28:00.000Z	dc	cry0	what build are you using?

2007-04-19T06:31:00.000Z	dc	cry0	did you look for a sources.list to start fresh from, entirely replacing the old one?
2007-04-19T06:33:00.000Z	dc	cry0	send me your sources.list?
2007-04-19T06:33:00.000Z	dc	cry0	do you have gnome or kde?
2007-04-19T06:34:00.000Z	dc	cry0	do you know which you have?
2007-04-19T06:34:00.000Z	dc	cry0	type this in terminal: sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list.   copy and paste that into the site nubby sent you
2007-04-19T06:35:00.000Z	dc	cry0	dont use sudo unless it doesnt open
2007-04-19T06:37:00.000Z	dc	cry0	no clue man, sorry
