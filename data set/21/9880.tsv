2010-07-29T06:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ubuntus	 i find it very stable.
2010-07-29T06:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ubuntus	 if you want a newer kernel . try the next release thats in testing.
2010-07-29T06:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ubuntus	 please lose the attitude.
2010-07-29T19:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ubuntus	 how did you install the older one?  was it a .deb or .tar.gz that you downloaded?
2010-07-29T19:03:00.000Z	Ubuntus	Dr_Willis	it was a .deb file, but there is still no .deb file in the Blender webpage
2010-07-29T19:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ubuntus	 uninstall the old via the package manager. install the new..
2010-07-29T19:05:00.000Z	Ubuntus	Dr_Willis	I already downloaded the new one, but i wanted that folder to be where the old one is, in the Aplication/Graphics site. Where is exactly that in my system?
2010-07-29T19:05:00.000Z	Ubuntus	Dr_Willis	Maybe i could just drag and drop the folder there
2010-07-29T19:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ubuntus	 learn to use the package manager system
2010-07-29T19:07:00.000Z	Ubuntus	Dr_Willis	So drag and drop wont work , eh?
2010-07-29T19:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ubuntus	 if its not in .deb  format, then put it in /opt/ or somewhere that it wont posiboally break things
2010-07-29T19:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ubuntus	 you proberly dont even need to install it 'ssytem wide' at all. You could keep it in the users home dir
2010-07-29T19:09:00.000Z	Ubuntus	Dr_Willis	Well, it was because i had my folder in "my documents", and when i meved the Blender icon to my desktop, i could not acces the program
2010-07-29T19:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ubuntus	 mand a new icon if its just the icon thats the issue
2010-07-29T19:09:00.000Z	Ubuntus	Dr_Willis	Sp i thought maybe needs to be in the Aplications/Graphics site
2010-07-29T19:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Ubuntus	  make a new launcher pointing to wever its at
2010-07-29T19:12:00.000Z	Ubuntus	Dr_Willis	Still, i wanted that to be in my aplication/graphics, so it looks more organized, but, meh, if Ubuntu can't do that...
2010-07-29T22:03:00.000Z	Ubuntus	Dr_Willis	That is what i did, i choose i CPU core to work 100%, and then the other one at 100% too, but the system monitor only shows 1 working 100%
