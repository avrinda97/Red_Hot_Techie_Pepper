2005-06-07T10:21:00.000Z	fabs		Guys, why do I receive this error in my webbrowser when I try to load a page with Flash content: The plugin initialization failed
2005-06-07T10:23:00.000Z	fabs		Guys, anyone could help with flash probs here?
2005-06-07T10:23:00.000Z	danba	fabs	sudo aptitude install flashplayer-mozilla
2005-06-07T10:24:00.000Z	fabs	danba	thanks but I think I got it, but it still shows me that silly error on the bottom of the browser...
2005-06-07T10:24:00.000Z	danba	fabs	is it a trailer site, for streaming media?
2005-06-07T10:24:00.000Z	fabs	danba	nope just the menu is in Flash
2005-06-07T10:25:00.000Z	danba	fabs	link me,
2005-06-07T10:25:00.000Z	fabs	danba	http://www.visualdesigner.net
2005-06-07T10:26:00.000Z	fabs	danba	it seems to be installing, that means I didn't have it installed properly perhaps, cos I tried to do it via Synaptic...
2005-06-07T10:27:00.000Z	danba	fabs	jsut a sec.
2005-06-07T10:27:00.000Z	fabs	danba	sure, hmm still same
2005-06-07T10:28:00.000Z	danba	fabs	yes it does not work here neither. perhaps it is too advanced.
2005-06-07T10:28:00.000Z	danba	fabs	on the other hand, maybe it is java, have taht working?
2005-06-07T10:29:00.000Z	fabs	danba	oh u are right, well anyway I could try to re-install it? Via Synaptic? Oh try this, it was working b4 http://www.m2o.it
2005-06-07T10:30:00.000Z	fabs	danba	also because I did install VB6 with CrossOver and it did play about with java stuff, so u are prob right
2005-06-07T10:30:00.000Z	danba	fabs	yeah, that is a quicktime type of thing, embedded video... mplayer needed for that, and it does not always work... http://ubuntuguide.org/#mplayer .
2005-06-07T10:31:00.000Z	danba	fabs	referring to the second site.
2005-06-07T10:31:00.000Z	fabs	danba	strange though it used to work, but I have just realized no java is installed in my sys
2005-06-07T10:32:00.000Z	danba	fabs	I have 3 at least installed, still it does not work, I broke it somewhere, but I dont care enough yet to fix it...
2005-06-07T10:33:00.000Z	fabs	danba	yes, I think i have done the same... thanks a lot for ur help anyway!!
