2005-04-03T08:17:00.000Z	regeya		a b&w g3 should run acceptably well...provided you have plenty of ram
2005-04-03T08:18:00.000Z	regeya		I've been thinking of picking up a G3 blue-n-white
2005-04-03T08:18:00.000Z	regeya		I found a place that has 'em for around $300
2005-04-03T08:18:00.000Z	regeya		or was it $200
2005-04-03T08:19:00.000Z	regeya		no way
2005-04-03T08:19:00.000Z	regeya		not sharing SeeleyUSMC :-) you schmucks will get 'em before I get the cash

2005-04-03T08:21:00.000Z	regeya		I believe the one I found was a refurb, but I know what you're saying robertj_
2005-04-03T08:22:00.000Z	regeya		everyone I know with g3 ibooks have good luck with 'em...and I hear horror stories all over the place.  guess it's hit-or-miss.
2005-04-03T08:24:00.000Z	Roey	regeya	 it's good though that you're not one of those misguided folks who right grammar 'grammer'
2005-04-03T08:24:00.000Z	regeya		Roey!
2005-04-03T08:24:00.000Z	regeya		did you do that on purpose? :-)
2005-04-03T08:26:00.000Z	Roey	regeya	 what, the grammER thing?
2005-04-03T08:26:00.000Z	Roey	regeya	 or the evms thing?
2005-04-03T08:26:00.000Z	Roey	regeya	 I *didn't* want EVMS installed.
