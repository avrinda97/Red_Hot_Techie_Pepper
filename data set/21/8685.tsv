2006-02-19T16:45:00.000Z	ribaldjester		I am having trouble compiling a kernel module - I keep getting GCC errors
2006-02-19T16:45:00.000Z	ribaldjester		like thus: gcc-3.4: command not found
2006-02-19T16:47:00.000Z	ribaldjester		ok - I'll try that again..thanks
2006-02-19T16:48:00.000Z	ribaldjester		hrmmm apt-get install sez - gcc is already the newest version.
2006-02-19T16:48:00.000Z	ribaldjester		lemme try synaptic
2006-02-19T16:48:00.000Z	ribaldjester		ah now I get Package gcc-3.4 is not available, but is referred to by another package.
2006-02-19T16:48:00.000Z	ribaldjester		This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
2006-02-19T16:48:00.000Z	ribaldjester		is only available from another source
2006-02-19T16:48:00.000Z	ribaldjester		do I need to update my apt-get repositories?
2006-02-19T16:49:00.000Z	ribaldjester		thanks...reading
