2009-10-24T08:51:00.000Z	gtech		I'm trying to run  a program called stripe snoop and the executable named ss is in my file path but when I enter ./ss it tells me the file doesn't exist
2009-10-24T08:52:00.000Z	ctmjr	gtech	did you try sudo ./ss
2009-10-24T08:53:00.000Z	gtech	ctmjr	yeah I did
2009-10-24T08:56:00.000Z	ctmjr	gtech	what is the extension of the file ie .sh .pl.
2009-10-24T08:57:00.000Z	gtech	ctmjr	there is none
2009-10-24T08:58:00.000Z	ctmjr	gtech	then leave off the ./ and just run ss see what happens
2009-10-24T08:58:00.000Z	gtech	ctmjr	I have another program called ss that does something with networking and that executes
2009-11-29T11:21:00.000Z	ctmjr	gtech	did you install build-essential
2009-11-29T11:21:00.000Z	gtech	ctmjr	no, are there any other dependencies I should think about?
2009-11-29T11:23:00.000Z	ctmjr	gtech	from the dir your compiling in sudo apt-get build-dep gettext
2009-11-29T11:23:00.000Z	ctmjr	gtech	it should install the dependencies
2009-11-29T11:24:00.000Z	gtech	ctmjr	I can't get the network settings working
2009-11-29T11:25:00.000Z	ctmjr	gtech	you have no internet to install the dependencies?
2009-11-29T11:26:00.000Z	gtech	ctmjr	exactly I installed kwlan and it screwed up and uninstalled network manager so I'm trying to compile it
2009-11-29T11:27:00.000Z	ctmjr	gtech	do you have the install cd you used to install ubuntu?
2009-11-29T11:28:00.000Z	gtech	ctmjr	heh no I'm away from home
2009-11-29T11:28:00.000Z	gtech	ctmjr	if you could point me to a resource that shows me how to compile and find dependencies that'd be awesome
2009-11-29T11:32:00.000Z	ctmjr	gtech	well build-essential will give you most of the default dependencies but each package has it's own requirements that's where build-dep comes in handy but hold on a sec
2009-11-29T11:35:00.000Z	ctmjr	gtech	if your using karmic http://packages.ubuntu.com/karmic/network-manager
2009-11-29T11:36:00.000Z	gtech	ctmjr	beauty thanks a lot
2009-11-29T11:37:00.000Z	ctmjr	gtech	your welcome
