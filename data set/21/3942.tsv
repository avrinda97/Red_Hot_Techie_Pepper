2008-08-18T06:05:00.000Z	alistair		Help: can anyone talk to me about burning disks from Ubuntu - the interface and actions are a tad confusing thanks.
2008-08-18T06:06:00.000Z	carandraug	alistair	do you want to burn an image or your own project?
2008-08-18T06:06:00.000Z	alistair	carandraug	Hi I am finding that it 'appears' you can drag and drop to the DVD files
2008-08-18T06:07:00.000Z	alistair	carandraug	currently its saying writing files to DVD
2008-08-18T06:08:00.000Z	alistair	carandraug	now its come up with a write error. It actually seems that it cannot write to DVD without using a utility like Brasero or similar?
2008-08-18T06:08:00.000Z	carandraug	alistair	go to add/remove and install brasero
2008-08-18T06:09:00.000Z	alistair	carandraug	yea, Ive done that, but the stupid this is that it seems you can drag and drop files using Konqueror but it actually does not work that way.
2008-08-18T06:10:00.000Z	alistair	carandraug	eg If I drop the files they appear on the DVD directory immediately with a [burn file] button on the screen
2008-08-18T06:10:00.000Z	carandraug	alistair	I don't use KDE. Why don't you use brasero's own interface? That's how I do it?
2008-08-18T06:15:00.000Z	alistair	carandraug	when I use brasero interface it just sits there creating a checksum till I reboot.
2008-08-18T06:16:00.000Z	alistair	carandraug	Just used K3B and thats working but it sure was a lazy start - took ages to start writing disk
2008-08-30T08:25:00.000Z	carandraug	alistair	could you please be more specific?
2008-08-30T08:25:00.000Z	alistair	carandraug	Hi I go to home and can see the other user account I set up. I want to modify their .thunderbird contents but it says I dont have permission
2008-08-30T08:26:00.000Z	alistair	carandraug	I thought since I log in as admin that would give me permission?
2008-08-30T08:26:00.000Z	carandraug	alistair	what do you mean admin? You're logged in as root?
2008-08-30T08:27:00.000Z	alistair	carandraug	yep
2008-08-30T08:28:00.000Z	alistair	carandraug	actually, probably not I will have to check I log in as my own name but I set everything up so assumed I was admin.
2008-08-30T08:28:00.000Z	carandraug	alistair	you mean your user is root? If so, you SHOULD be able to do whatever you please. Is /home mounted as read-only?
2008-08-30T08:29:00.000Z	alistair	carandraug	no you are right I am logged in as Alistair, but not as root. Thanks kindly.
2008-08-30T08:29:00.000Z	carandraug	alistair	no problem. Glad to help
2008-08-31T10:55:00.000Z	carandraug	alistair	but with grub you can start windows. ALso, you can access your windows files from grub
