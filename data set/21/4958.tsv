2012-11-14T15:17:00.000Z	devswap		has anyone had avi files to play strangely in mediaplayer - having a coloured overlay that eventually clears until you skip forward and then it appears again and also jumping forward moving more in terms of time than it should?
2012-11-14T15:17:00.000Z	devswap		i suspect a codec issue but have the windows codecs installed
2012-11-14T15:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devswap	does it affect all players?
2012-11-14T15:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devswap	have you tried switching video output method?
2012-11-14T15:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devswap	vlc has the option in preferences. Try a few. X11 is usually pretty solid
2012-11-14T15:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devswap	try a few, see if it gets better
2012-11-14T15:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devswap	use mount in CLI may work. You will need the proprietary virtualbox for native usb access
2012-11-14T15:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devswap	I'd ask in #vbox
2012-11-14T15:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devswap	there is no single best
2012-11-14T17:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devswap	I doubt they have any 'agreement' its just the platforms they are choosing to support
2012-11-14T17:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devswap	possible, but not confirmable ;)
2012-11-14T17:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devswap	i'd say so considering you can setup an SFTP server on your PC and port forward though the router. You can then access your data anywhere
2012-11-14T17:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devswap	you can compare stuff like that in any purchasing situation
2012-11-14T17:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devswap	i dunno, the rhythmnbox plugin is pretty decent, but it should get cheaper over time I guess.
2012-11-19T15:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devswap	should be, yes
2012-11-19T15:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devswap	how big is the screen playing them?
2012-11-19T15:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devswap	i'd just look at actual throughput
2012-11-19T15:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devswap	I'd ask in ##hardware about that
2012-11-19T15:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devswap	unless you have a big screen, you don't need 1080P
2012-11-19T15:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devswap	your system will cache some to RAM as it'splayed, you'll be fine
2012-11-19T15:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	devswap	##hardware   again
