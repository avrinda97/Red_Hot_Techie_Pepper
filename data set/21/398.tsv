2012-01-12T19:39:00.000Z	Guest25668	werder	it's ntfs. zx81, yes, it is mounted
2012-01-12T19:34:00.000Z	werder	Guest25668	so you used PCLOS to put data on a usb stick and now Ubuntu can't see it?
2012-01-12T19:36:00.000Z	Guest25668	werder	yes, exactly
2012-01-12T19:36:00.000Z	werder	Guest25668	what filesystem did you format the stick in?
2012-01-12T19:38:00.000Z	Guest25668	werder	unfortunately that doesn't work. I know my files are there because the disk is a 64Gb ssd and I have 18Gb space. But I can see no folders or files
2012-01-12T19:38:00.000Z	werder	Guest25668	what filesystem is the driven in? Ext4, Fat32, etc?
2012-01-12T19:40:00.000Z	werder	Guest25668	do you have the ntfs tools installed?
2012-01-12T19:41:00.000Z	Guest25668	werder	I have ntfsprogs installed
2012-01-12T19:43:00.000Z	Guest25668	werder	& zx81, I suppose I could always dig up my PCLOS dvd and run live in root, but I was hoping there's be an easier way
2012-01-12T19:45:00.000Z	werder	Guest25668	do you have ntfs-3g installed?
2012-01-12T19:46:00.000Z	Guest25668	werder	yes I have it
2012-01-12T19:46:00.000Z	werder	Guest25668	weird
2012-01-12T19:51:00.000Z	werder	Guest25668	you've tried mounting and unmounting I suppose?
2012-01-12T19:51:00.000Z	Guest25668	werder	yes
2012-01-12T19:54:00.000Z	Guest25668	werder	& zx81, thanks for your efforts. I think I'm going to try using my PCLOS live dvd. Where Ubuntu fails, PCLOS succeeds and where PCLOS fails, Ubuntu succeeds. If we could only breed them. :D
2012-01-12T19:54:00.000Z	werder	Guest25668	that sounds like the best idea. ntfs I guess is still not fully stable in linux
2012-01-12T19:55:00.000Z	Guest25668	werder	I just remembered, I have dual-boot W7/Ubu. I should give W7 a shot
2012-01-12T19:56:00.000Z	werder	Guest25668	or that.
2012-01-12T19:57:00.000Z	Guest25668	werder	I'll try it. If it works I'll come back and tell you, just for future reference if needed
2012-01-12T19:57:00.000Z	werder	Guest25668	thanks.
2012-01-12T19:57:00.000Z	Guest25668	werder	thank you
