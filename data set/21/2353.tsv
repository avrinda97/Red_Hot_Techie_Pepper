2010-05-30T21:51:00.000Z	kjele	blackstar	Problems with pastebin?
2010-05-30T21:52:00.000Z	blackstar	kjele	i'm working on it
2010-05-30T21:58:00.000Z	blackstar	kjele	sorry man i took step by step screen shoots, but still having problems with pastebin, maybe i can email it to you?
2010-05-30T21:58:00.000Z	kjele	blackstar	just past it here then
2010-05-30T21:59:00.000Z	kjele	blackstar	it is only one line right?
2010-05-30T22:02:00.000Z	blackstar	kjele	just waiting for u to accept it
2010-05-30T22:02:00.000Z	kjele	blackstar	What is the url?
2010-05-30T22:04:00.000Z	kjele	blackstar	hmm . Open the file copy the content and go to pastebin.com and past it there
2010-05-30T22:04:00.000Z	kjele	blackstar	Then give me the url. Clean and simple
2010-05-30T22:18:00.000Z	kjele	blackstar	Still problems ? I see that you wanted to send a 6mb file that is kinda big. I just need to know what permissions are set on the file
2010-05-30T22:37:00.000Z	blackstar	kjele	sorry i finally figure out how pastebin work, i got tow urls firs one is http://paste.ubuntu.com/441855/ and the seccond url http://paste.ubuntu.com/441856/
2010-05-30T22:38:00.000Z	kjele	blackstar	Which file on the list you deleted?
2010-05-30T22:43:00.000Z	kjele	blackstar	I see so you actually deleted the root-owned file?
2010-05-30T22:46:00.000Z	blackstar	kjele	that right
2010-05-30T22:46:00.000Z	kjele	blackstar	The thing is that you are on a directory that you have permission to delete. So make a directory that is owned by root and put the files owned by root in there
2010-06-02T01:45:00.000Z	kjele	blackstar	As I told you create a folder with root permission then the file that you want to be root in there
2010-06-02T01:46:00.000Z	blackstar	kjele	sorry i miss that
