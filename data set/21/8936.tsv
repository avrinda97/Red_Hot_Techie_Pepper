2005-12-13T15:13:00.000Z	navarone		question: I have added in the last 4 months extra hdd, a sb live soundcard to replace onboard and a ethernet/network card. Will this put too much strain on a 300w ps?
2005-12-13T15:14:00.000Z	zandaa	navarone	I don't think it would be
2005-12-13T15:15:00.000Z	navarone	zandaa	I didn't think so...ps is not seeming to be overworked or overheated...but fans are noisy and prob need a replacement then
2005-12-13T15:15:00.000Z	zandaa	navarone	fans can lower in noise with a drop of oil in the bearing
2005-12-13T15:18:00.000Z	zandaa	navarone	is there a lot of dust on your fans/hardware??? (better remove that)
2005-12-13T15:19:00.000Z	zandaa	navarone	that does sound like it's needing a replacement, fans aren't that expensive though
2005-12-14T17:11:00.000Z	navarone	zandaa	I has similar permissions prob with fat32 partition. I ahd to create a folder on drive thru ubuntu in order to transfer files between. Original folders retained permissions from windows
2005-12-14T17:11:00.000Z	zandaa	navarone	could you explain more clearly??? (I'm kinda sleepy and originally dutch, so you confuse me)
2005-12-14T17:14:00.000Z	zandaa	navarone	this isn't truly about file sharing... I just wanna listen to music
2005-12-14T17:15:00.000Z	zandaa	navarone	no it isn't... it's my Apple iPod music player that has FAT partition
2005-12-14T17:17:00.000Z	zandaa	navarone	it's not specifically the iPod.... it can't read any files
2005-12-14T17:17:00.000Z	zandaa	navarone	that's because it just crashes on startup
2005-12-14T17:17:00.000Z	navarone	zandaa	is the ipod automounting when plugged in?
2005-12-14T17:18:00.000Z	zandaa	navarone	yes it is, why?
2005-12-14T17:18:00.000Z	navarone	zandaa	jsut trying to see what is wrong
2005-12-14T17:19:00.000Z	zandaa	navarone	nothing is wrong anymore... I just using xmms now.. kinda used to winamp so just as easy
2005-12-14T17:19:00.000Z	navarone	zandaa	were you trying amarok?
2005-12-14T17:20:00.000Z	zandaa	navarone	what's amarok?
2005-12-16T12:06:00.000Z	zandaa	navarone	there are libraries in development to do that though
2006-01-29T07:16:00.000Z	navarone	zandaa	did you try live cd and see if it would work?
2006-01-29T07:16:00.000Z	zandaa	navarone	yes
