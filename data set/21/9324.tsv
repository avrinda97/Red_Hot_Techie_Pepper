2005-10-06T14:58:00.000Z	Kyral	QT4Dance	you are better off doing it Gentoo style, 'cause thats what you know. Get the binary packages offa Portage and burn them :P
2005-10-06T14:49:00.000Z	Kyral	QT4Dance	why?
2005-10-06T14:52:00.000Z	Kyral	QT4Dance	how do you know they have the same preferences as you?
2005-10-06T14:54:00.000Z	QT4Dance	Kyral	imagine something like KDevelop has millions of dependensies. u have to install the dependensies in order
2005-10-06T14:55:00.000Z	Kyral	QT4Dance	or make a repo outta the CD
2005-10-06T14:56:00.000Z	Kyral	QT4Dance	then wtf are you doing here?! No offense
2005-10-06T14:57:00.000Z	QT4Dance	Kyral	I can use gentoo but my friends can't. I am tring to customize kubntu for them
2005-10-06T14:59:00.000Z	QT4Dance	Kyral	I thought about that but the problem is in hardware detection. I cuztomize my kernel my self
2005-10-06T15:00:00.000Z	Kyral	QT4Dance	genkernel
2005-10-06T15:00:00.000Z	QT4Dance	Kyral	genkernel sucks
2005-10-06T15:00:00.000Z	QT4Dance	Kyral	many hardware is not detected by it
