2007-06-10T12:30:00.000Z	Deinumite		anyone know the easiest way to install Ubuntu onto a usb stick?
2007-06-10T12:30:00.000Z	ikonia	Deinumite	use the cdrom
2007-06-10T12:30:00.000Z	Deinumite	ikonia	i can use the cd and install onto the usb drive?
2007-06-10T12:30:00.000Z	ikonia	Deinumite	yes
2007-06-10T12:31:00.000Z	Deinumite	ikonia	how big is the defualt size for ubuntu?
2007-06-10T12:31:00.000Z	ikonia	Deinumite	2 gig I think
2007-06-10T12:31:00.000Z	Deinumite	ikonia	uh oh...my sticks 2 gig i think :P
2007-06-10T12:31:00.000Z	Deinumite	ikonia	gparted loads but doesnt see my disk....so i need to find a way around it
2007-06-10T12:32:00.000Z	ikonia	Deinumite	why do you want it on a usb - its going to be a lot of hassle booting from usb etc etc
2007-06-10T12:32:00.000Z	Deinumite	ikonia	gparted not loading up my harddrive :( the live cd anyways, the gparted while running ubuntu does
2007-06-10T12:34:00.000Z	Deinumite	ikonia	could i use gparted from the ubuntu live cd? the gparted live cd doesnt detect my harddrive for some reason
2007-06-10T12:34:00.000Z	ikonia	Deinumite	whats the gparted livecd ?
2007-06-10T12:34:00.000Z	Deinumite	ikonia	im not sure which version it is, but i do know that ive used it before on my same harddrive multiple times
2007-06-10T12:35:00.000Z	ikonia	Deinumite	why have you downloaded a live cd just to use gparted when its already on the ubuntu livecd
2007-06-10T12:35:00.000Z	Deinumite	ikonia	i used it before using Ubuntu, and i didnt realize i could use it XD
2007-06-10T12:36:00.000Z	Deinumite	ikonia	wow, well thats probably fixed my problem XD thanks hahah ill go use the ubuntu CD then XD
2007-06-10T12:36:00.000Z	ikonia	Deinumite	good choice
2007-06-10T12:36:00.000Z	Deinumite	ikonia	its still kinda stupid that gparted worked before, and then decides to stop working....but oh well
2007-06-10T12:36:00.000Z	Deinumite	ikonia	thanks again
2007-06-10T13:10:00.000Z	ikonia	Deinumite	not an ubuntu issue
