2010-07-13T16:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Jinxed-	 mythtv can do some amazing things. :) its a complex and powerfull system
2010-07-13T16:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Jinxed-	 clarify what youmean by 'raw' video.
2010-07-13T16:45:00.000Z	Jinxed-	Dr_Willis	as in I record some footage from a camera and then just send that video prob maybe encode to h264 to server
2010-07-13T16:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Jinxed-	 'send that video'  ? You mean copy from a camcorder to HD? mythtv wouldent be involved in that..  If you were recording a video Input  or somthing from a tv card.. well then mythtv can help.
2010-07-13T16:47:00.000Z	Jinxed-	Dr_Willis	yeah... i don't actually need the tv part of mythtv,
2010-07-13T16:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Jinxed-	 then you basically need some sort of video 'server' im guessing.
2010-07-13T16:49:00.000Z	Jinxed-	Dr_Willis	exactly, and I wasn't sure if mythtv was appropriate or if it was too far away from what I needed to really be applicable
2010-08-16T17:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Jinxed-	 how are the network web cams sending the info?  They special network enabled cams that have a web interface or what exactly?
2010-08-16T17:25:00.000Z	Jinxed-	Dr_Willis	the cams will be sending streams (udp, rtsp, rtp)
2010-08-16T17:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Jinxed-	 VLC should be able to capture it then. or perhaps streamtuner/streamripper
2010-08-16T17:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Jinxed-	 been wanting to get one of those for the wife. for a security camera for the front porch. :0 but too much $$$ for her.
2010-08-16T17:27:00.000Z	Jinxed-	Dr_Willis	have you ever looked into zoneminder?
2010-08-16T17:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Jinxed-	 just looked at the store yesterday at a few of them.
2010-08-25T20:13:00.000Z	Jinxed-	Dr_Willis	do you know how to see if ubuntu can see my com ports?
2010-08-25T20:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Jinxed-	 serial ports?  See if theres a /dev/ttyS* for them
2010-11-08T22:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Jinxed-	 the remote desktop feaute of ubuntu uses 'vnc' as its protocal. any vnc client can connect to it.
2010-11-08T22:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Jinxed-	 but over the internet.. im not sure thats secure.
2010-11-08T22:55:00.000Z	Jinxed-	Dr_Willis	what do you mean by not secure?
2010-11-08T22:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Jinxed-	 vnc is not very 'secure' over the internet. its mainly for lan use.
2010-11-08T22:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Jinxed-	 you could ssh to their box. if its set up.
2010-11-08T22:57:00.000Z	Jinxed-	Dr_Willis	it's not :(
