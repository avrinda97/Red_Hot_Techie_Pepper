2010-05-31T08:51:00.000Z	julio		i'm unable to switch icon themes 80% of them show the base gnome grey icons, ideas?
2010-05-31T08:53:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	julio	what icon theme gives you this problem?
2010-05-31T08:57:00.000Z	julio	onetinsoldier	blankon, dropline neu, dropline nuovo, gperfection2, humility, suede... they change some icons, but not folder icons...
2010-05-31T09:01:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	julio	roger. i'm really not to sure. have you considered renaming your ~/.icons and ~/.themes directories and trying again?
2010-05-31T09:02:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	julio	since they do seem to work to some degree, i take it that if you do the following command --> dpkg -L gnome-humility-icon-theme | grep index   ...that you get the following output --> /usr/share/icons/Humility/index.theme  ..but thought maybe i should check anyway
2010-05-31T09:04:00.000Z	julio	onetinsoldier	indeed thats the output... is that right?
2010-05-31T09:05:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	julio	yes.. that's correct
2010-05-31T09:06:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	julio	have you installed any icon sets or themes from source? as in a .tar.gz file?
2010-05-31T09:07:00.000Z	julio	onetinsoldier	nope... all from repos
2010-05-31T09:09:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	julio	roger. i don't know really. strange. i just tried the 'Nuvola' theme here. worked fine, icons and all
2010-05-31T09:11:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	julio	have you looked in your ~/.icons and ~/.themes directories? you probably don't have anything in there if you haven't installed any .tar.gz themes/icon sets
2010-05-31T09:11:00.000Z	julio	onetinsoldier	this weird behaviour started in karmic, i've updated a few days ago and decided to check... and stillhappends :s
2010-05-31T09:12:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	julio	so, you running on an upgrade ?
2010-05-31T09:12:00.000Z	julio	onetinsoldier	yup 9.04 --> 9.10 --> 10.04 :-P
2010-05-31T09:13:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	julio	roger that
2010-05-31T09:13:00.000Z	julio	onetinsoldier	icons folder doesn't have anything but themes has a few subfolders
2010-05-31T09:13:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	julio	roger. consider renaming that directory, then choosing a new theme
2010-05-31T09:27:00.000Z	julio	onetinsoldier	renamed both, no effect :O
2010-05-31T09:28:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	julio	roger. you could go to drastic measures short of reinstalling
2010-05-31T09:32:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	julio	you could go to drastic measures short of reinstalling fresh and clean, which to me, would be.. to exit out of X-Windows.. at virtual terminal do the following --> rm -rf .cache .config .gconf .gconfd .gnome2* .icons .local .nautilus .themes  ...or something of that nature. you probably get the idea
2010-05-31T09:33:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	julio	yeah... what bastidrazor said.. test out a new user. see if your theme icons work ok for newly created user
