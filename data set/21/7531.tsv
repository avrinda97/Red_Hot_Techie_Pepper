2006-10-22T12:52:00.000Z	JosefK	marc_	heh, run 'lsb_release -a' in a terminal, it'll tell you dapper or edgy
2006-10-22T12:53:00.000Z	JosefK	marc_	if it's dapper, run 'sudo aptitude install linux-686' (assuming you're in i386, not amd64), if it's edgy, run 'sudo aptitude install linux-generic'
2006-10-22T12:53:00.000Z	JosefK	marc_	sudo aptitude install linux-686
2006-10-22T12:54:00.000Z	JosefK	marc_	if you're on i386.  that should install a resticted modules package too
2006-10-22T12:55:00.000Z	JosefK	marc_	np's, try rebooting afterwards and (hopefully) your card should appear
2006-10-22T12:56:00.000Z	JosefK	marc_	if it's a supported card, that is ;)
2006-10-22T12:57:00.000Z	JosefK	marc_	if it's pcmcia it's roulette, if it doesn't work, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper - you can use your windows drivers with that
2006-10-22T12:58:00.000Z	JosefK	marc_	okay ;) good luck!
2006-10-22T13:11:00.000Z	JosefK	marc_	any luck?
2006-10-22T13:12:00.000Z	JosefK	marc_	ack :( if it still isn't showing up even under 'iwconfig', it mustn't be supported
2006-10-22T13:12:00.000Z	JosefK	marc_	if you see an entry for a wireless card in 'iwconfig' though, 'sudo aptitude install network-manager-gnome' should be all you need
