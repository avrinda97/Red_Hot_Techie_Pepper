2011-02-04T21:07:00.000Z	teicah		must I compile "firmware" into a new kernel for a single user desktop system?
2011-02-04T21:08:00.000Z	sacarlson	teicah	firmware is sometimes used in wifi and maybe other things,  do you use wifi in this desktop system?
2011-02-04T21:09:00.000Z	teicah	sacarlson	10x.  No, I don't use wifi.. It is a wired connection
2011-02-04T21:09:00.000Z	teicah	sacarlson	would I need firmware compiled if I plan on installing radeon proprietary drivers?
2011-02-04T21:10:00.000Z	sacarlson	teicah	well it takes not much space or time to compile so I think I would keep it in the event you test a usb wifi dongle with it some day
2011-02-04T21:11:00.000Z	sacarlson	teicah	what would it hurt if you did compile the firmware?
2011-02-04T21:12:00.000Z	teicah		dunno..
2011-02-04T21:12:00.000Z	sacarlson	teicah	I guess worst case you can delete the firmware files after you compile if it breaks something
2011-02-04T21:12:00.000Z	teicah		I guess I just want it as lean as possible
2011-02-04T21:13:00.000Z	teicah		I see.  Thanks for your time
2011-02-04T21:14:00.000Z	sacarlson	teicah	and for me it takes hours to compile so I turn lots of stuf on so I don't have to do it again
2011-02-04T21:14:00.000Z	teicah	sacarlson	Let me ask you one more question.  What is your media player of preference?
2011-02-04T21:15:00.000Z	teicah		"hours to compile"?  Do you have a single processor system?
2011-02-04T21:15:00.000Z	sacarlson	teicah	totem seems to come up as default so that's what I normaly use
2011-02-04T21:15:00.000Z	sacarlson	teicah	no it's dual core but old
2011-02-04T21:16:00.000Z	sacarlson	teicah	maybe I count the time it takes to download the source also
2011-02-04T21:17:00.000Z	teicah		ouch
2011-02-04T21:17:00.000Z	teicah		!
2011-02-04T21:17:00.000Z	sacarlson	teicah	put it this way it takes long enuf for me to leave so I"m not sure how long it takes
2011-02-04T21:19:00.000Z	teicah		I remember those days.  I would download the ubuntu iso with dialup.. I took 25 hours!  Now w/comcast about 20mins
2011-02-04T21:19:00.000Z	sacarlson	teicah	even at 20 mins I'm not going to sit there waiting for it
