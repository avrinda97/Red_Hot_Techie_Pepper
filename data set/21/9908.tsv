2009-09-13T17:27:00.000Z	Owner	genobreaker	wasn't mockin you mate... just found it funny
2009-09-13T17:27:00.000Z	Owner	genobreaker	read: been there, done that..
2009-09-13T17:29:00.000Z	Owner	genobreaker	why don't you just rm that file and install vuze from the repos?
2009-09-13T17:37:00.000Z	Owner	genobreaker	try this... open terminal and cd into the particular directory, where you saved that file. then run "sudo rm Vuze_Installer.tar.bz2" enter your admin password and the file should be gone. the run "sudo aptitude install vuze" and you should have it!
2009-09-13T17:38:00.000Z	Owner	genobreaker	do you know how to use the terminal?

2009-09-13T17:43:00.000Z	Owner	genobreaker	use terminal. do you know how?
2009-09-13T17:49:00.000Z	Owner	genobreaker	the problem sits between the chair and keyboard. many people have devoted their time to helping you and you just keep on flooding. sorry man.
