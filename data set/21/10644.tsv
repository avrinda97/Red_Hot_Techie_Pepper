2007-05-29T10:23:00.000Z	dr_willis	ubunt1	 depends on how paranoid you want to be. I dont worry about it. :)
2007-05-29T10:24:00.000Z	ubunt1	dr_willis	yo uare paranoid,we need to be protected by the hacker
2007-05-29T10:24:00.000Z	ubunt1	dr_willis	you
2007-05-29T10:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	ubunt1	 if you want a secure system - dont just rely on the router. but it also is  a MUST to learn how/what  securing a system means. not just relying on some front end/firewall to do it.
2007-05-29T10:25:00.000Z	ubunt1	dr_willis	i want to protect ubuntu no to hack the password is that possible
2007-05-29T10:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	ubunt1	 ubuntu is very well protected by default.. Its your windows box's that willbe the big problem - not ubuntu
2007-05-29T10:27:00.000Z	ubunt1	dr_willis	i remember that someone say that someone hack his computer
2007-05-29T10:27:00.000Z	ubunt1	dr_willis	and he write it here in the irc.
2007-05-29T10:28:00.000Z	ubunt1	dr_willis	what can you say about that case?
2007-05-29T10:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	ubunt1	 for the truely truely security paranoid thers those   SElinux things.. and other ways.
2007-05-29T10:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	ubunt1	 with the right setup - even having the root password wont mean much
2007-05-29T10:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	ubunt1	 of course doing any changes to the system will be a real hassle as well. :) but thats the point
2007-05-29T10:29:00.000Z	ubunt1	dr_willis	ok now what can i need to do,to be protected ?
2007-05-29T10:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	ubunt1	 learn/use sudo as it should be used.. use a good password - will be a HUGE step in being protected.
2007-05-29T10:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	ubunt1	 set up ya router to block anything/everything ya dont need.
2007-05-29T10:29:00.000Z	ubunt1	dr_willis	password like what?
2007-05-29T10:30:00.000Z	ubunt1	dr_willis	how long need to be the password?
2007-05-29T10:30:00.000Z	dr_willis	ubunt1	 a good Secure password. :) time to do some googling :)
2007-05-29T10:30:00.000Z	ubunt1	dr_willis	ok i will it.
