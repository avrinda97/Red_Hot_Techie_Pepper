2009-08-14T02:13:00.000Z	notbenh		hello all, weird issue NetworkManager seems to not remember conection configs
2009-08-14T02:14:00.000Z	notbenh		currently it has nothing under the wired tab in the GUI though there are files under system-connections
2009-08-14T02:14:00.000Z	notbenh		tried /etc/inet.d/NetworkManager restart and still nothing
2009-08-14T02:15:00.000Z	notbenh		ifconfig eth0 up and down appear to work but I still can not ping
2009-08-14T02:15:00.000Z	notbenh		resolve.conf looks fine
2009-08-14T02:15:00.000Z	notbenh		can any one think of anything that Ive missed?
2009-08-14T02:15:00.000Z	xlq	notbenh	what're you trying to ping?
2009-08-14T02:16:00.000Z	notbenh	xlq	google.com and http://google.com
2009-08-14T02:17:00.000Z	notbenh	xlq	 both return the unknown host error
2009-08-14T02:17:00.000Z	xlq	notbenh	can you ping 74.125.67.100?
2009-08-14T02:17:00.000Z	notbenh	xlq	yes
2009-08-14T02:18:00.000Z	xlq	notbenh	then it's probably your resolv.conf
2009-08-14T02:19:00.000Z	notbenh	xlq	I
2009-08-14T02:19:00.000Z	notbenh	xlq	I'll poke at it again
2009-08-14T02:19:00.000Z	notbenh	xlq	 thanks
2009-08-14T02:19:00.000Z	xlq	notbenh	are you configuring manually or using dhcp?
2009-08-14T02:19:00.000Z	notbenh	xlq	manual
2009-08-14T02:20:00.000Z	xlq	notbenh	what does your resolv.conf contain now?
2009-08-14T02:23:00.000Z	notbenh	xlq	#Generated by NetworkManager and the 3 ip's for the nameservers
2009-08-14T02:25:00.000Z	notbenh	xlq	ya that was it, dont know what it was but I moved resolv and then did it by hand and things are back up again
2009-08-14T02:25:00.000Z	notbenh	xlq	thanks
