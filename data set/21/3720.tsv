2008-10-12T18:57:00.000Z	guest123		I just installed Ubuntu on a friends' laptop, and the fan just keeps going al the time
2008-10-12T18:57:00.000Z	guest123		it's really loud and annoying, is there a quick fix I can do to keep the fan noise down?
2008-10-12T18:58:00.000Z	guest123		like, if there's a cfig file that sets the cpu settings, or the fan settings
2008-10-12T18:58:00.000Z	guest123		or if maybe there's an app I can install that monitors the settings, and alows me to turn it on and off as needed?
2008-10-12T18:59:00.000Z	diskin_	guest123	there should be cpu driver installed for the laptop model
2008-10-12T18:59:00.000Z	diskin_	guest123	for example, I have powernow_k8 on my turion-based laptop
2008-10-12T18:59:00.000Z	guest123	diskin_	where would I look for that, and how can I use the driver to change the fan settings?
2008-10-12T19:00:00.000Z	diskin_	guest123	lsmod|grep cpu first
2008-10-12T19:01:00.000Z	guest123	diskin_	ok, there's 5 results, shall I pastebin them?
2008-10-12T19:01:00.000Z	diskin_	guest123	yes
2008-10-12T19:01:00.000Z	guest123	diskin_	 http://paste.ubuntu.com/56652/
2008-10-12T19:02:00.000Z	diskin_	guest123	I see no cpu driver there. what is the make of laptop?
2008-10-12T19:03:00.000Z	guest123		Compaq Presario 3000
2008-10-12T19:03:00.000Z	guest123		it's kind of old
2008-10-12T19:06:00.000Z	diskin_	guest123	looks like you also need powernow-k8
2008-10-12T19:07:00.000Z	guest123	diskin_	would powernowd suffice?
2008-10-12T19:07:00.000Z	diskin_	guest123	AFAIK no. check http://badcomputer.org/unix/compaqr3000.bot
2008-10-12T19:07:00.000Z	diskin_	guest123	and try modprobe powernow-k8
2008-10-12T19:08:00.000Z	guest123	diskin_	ah, because I apt-cache searched pwernow and it came up with powernowd which seems to be a cpu speed controller
2008-10-12T19:09:00.000Z	diskin_	guest123	I do not remember myself installing powernow-k8 - perhaps it was there already. try modprobe...
2008-10-12T19:09:00.000Z	guest123	diskin_	k
