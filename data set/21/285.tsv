2012-03-29T08:50:00.000Z	kevdog		I'm wondering what the best way to upgrade from 11.10 to 12.04 -- gosh darn I hate upgrading
2012-03-29T08:51:00.000Z	bsidhipo	kevdog	distupgrade?
2012-03-29T08:59:00.000Z	bsidhipo	kevdog	it has its uses
2012-03-29T08:59:00.000Z	bsidhipo	kevdog	my little tower of pandaboards run gentoo, for example
2012-03-29T09:00:00.000Z	kevdog	bsidhipo	why not something else?
2012-03-29T09:00:00.000Z	bsidhipo	kevdog	it's small and to the point
2012-03-29T09:00:00.000Z	bsidhipo	kevdog	besides i can customize and debug, for example, framebuffer driver easily
2012-03-29T09:01:00.000Z	kevdog	bsidhipo	Id have no idea how to customize a framebuffer driver even if I wanted to
2012-03-29T09:10:00.000Z	bsidhipo	kevdog	use low-bandwidth X then?  nomachine's maybe?
2012-03-29T09:12:00.000Z	bsidhipo	kevdog	it's not bandwidth that kills you.  it's the latency.
2012-03-29T09:13:00.000Z	bsidhipo	kevdog	no.  you just have to use solutions like, ok, Exceed onDemand (commercial)
2012-03-29T09:13:00.000Z	bsidhipo	kevdog	with EOD, we can work interactive in San Jose (CA) from, for example, Austin (TX) without noticeable delays
2012-03-29T09:14:00.000Z	bsidhipo	kevdog	there are free solutions too (like nomachine's NX i told you about)
2012-03-29T09:15:00.000Z	kevdog	bsidhipo	no machine is worse than just tunneling x -- plus it crashes a lot with me
2012-03-29T09:16:00.000Z	bsidhipo	kevdog	sometimes you have to go graphical.  for example, what about ilo / drac from half a continent away?  you surely don't suggest getting on a plane to push a button :-)
2012-03-29T09:17:00.000Z	kevdog	bsidhipo	never used those programs, so I really wouldn't know
2012-03-29T09:19:00.000Z	bsidhipo	kevdog	in case you're interested, ilo and drac are dell (and hp, in that order)'s implementation of video and keyboard/mouse input/output over the network, so that you can manage every aspect of a machine over a network where the machine might not be in the same city you're in
2012-03-29T09:19:00.000Z	bsidhipo	kevdog	uh i got the order reversed
2012-03-29T09:20:00.000Z	kevdog	bsidhipo	Sounds like a dream...if it works
2012-03-29T09:40:00.000Z	bsidhipo	kevdog	shhhhhh, it's vnc.  it's not "real X"
2012-03-29T09:42:00.000Z	bsidhipo	kevdog	i *think* he's talking about the virtual resolution on the vnc server side ... unless he's talking about the client side, which he hasn't made clear ... i'm assuming he meant the server side (which is headless)
