2007-04-22T15:49:00.000Z	psycop		what is it with firefox eating all cpu power?
2007-04-22T15:50:00.000Z	|ringo|	psycop	lots of extensions cause cpu/ram troubles, also lots of tabs.  if that isnt your case, switch to opera
2007-04-22T15:50:00.000Z	psycop		i have 2 windows open and it starts to use all my cpu
2007-04-22T15:50:00.000Z	psycop		-.-
2007-04-22T15:50:00.000Z	|ringo|	psycop	 well firefox is bloated, so wait for a patch or use something else
2007-04-22T15:51:00.000Z	psycop		all right
2007-04-22T15:52:00.000Z	psycop		another question
2007-04-22T15:52:00.000Z	psycop		why can i only get up to 55hz at screensync?
2007-04-22T15:52:00.000Z	psycop		should be able to handle 75
2007-04-22T15:53:00.000Z	|ringo|	psycop	it depends on your specific monitor
2007-04-22T15:53:00.000Z	psycop	|ringo|	its a samsung syncmaster 940b
2007-04-22T15:54:00.000Z	|ringo|	psycop	that one can go up to 75
2007-04-22T15:55:00.000Z	psycop		yes, but the highest i can pick is 55
2007-04-22T15:55:00.000Z	|ringo|	psycop	DVI ?
2007-04-22T15:55:00.000Z	psycop		yes
2007-04-22T15:55:00.000Z	|ringo|	psycop	not totally sure on this, but i think with DVI, the hardware just picks the optimal vsync
2007-04-22T15:56:00.000Z	|ringo|	psycop	there should be a way to edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf to force a particular vsync but i havent done that before.  xorg.conf is where to look though
2007-04-22T15:57:00.000Z	psycop		if i chose 75hz in the nividia x server settings the picture just freezes
2007-04-22T15:58:00.000Z	|ringo|	psycop	 hmm.  might have more luck posting on a samsung forum.  is there any particualr reason why you want 75hz instead of 50?
2007-04-22T15:58:00.000Z	psycop	|ringo|	i better like to look at 75hz screens -.-
2007-04-22T15:59:00.000Z	|ringo|	psycop	 well maybe someone else here has some more experiene with editing xorg.conf than i do
