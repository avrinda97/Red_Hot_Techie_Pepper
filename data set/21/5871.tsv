2007-12-24T07:52:00.000Z	Creed		How do I mount remote SMB shares in Ubuntu?
2007-12-24T07:53:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Creed	 several ways.. to MOUNT them - you can edit the fstab.. or use the fuse-samba tools,
2007-12-24T07:53:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Creed	 or a frontend like smb4k,  For quick access thers the smb:// feature of Konqueror.
2007-12-24T07:53:00.000Z	Creed	Dr_willis	Im a gnome lover :) lol No Konqueror
2007-12-24T07:54:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Creed	 gnome has a similer smb:/ thing.
2007-12-24T07:54:00.000Z	Creed	Dr_willis	got a guide on how to setup fuse-samba?
2007-12-24T07:54:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Creed	 i installed it and read its docs. :)  You add your user to the fuse group. make a .smb/smb.config file and run tthe tool
2007-12-24T07:54:00.000Z	Creed	Dr_willis	Im trying to get XMMS or VLC to play media files off my NAS to stream over Ventrilo, the way Ubuntu does it, neither program can see the mounts.
2007-12-24T07:55:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Creed	  theres mounting the shares, then thers browsing the shares. :) - the  fuse smb stuff should make the shares apear as local dirs for the programs
2007-12-24T08:01:00.000Z	Creed	Dr_willis	the man page is a little bare for fusesmb. So far I've created /home/smb and done "fusesmb /home/smb". What do I do from there?
2007-12-24T08:02:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Creed	 cp /usr/share/doc/fusesmb/examples/fusesmb.conf.ex /home/USERNAME/.smb/fusesmb.conf    must be done. Then Edit that file.. you needto enter the proper info there.
2007-12-24T08:02:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Creed	 and you Need to have your user int he fuse group
2007-12-24T08:03:00.000Z	Creed	Dr_willis	thanks! Time to get busy heh

2007-12-24T08:04:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Creed	 BUT the user must totally lot out to get the new group setting.. (or cheat and some how login again with like 'ssh localhost')
2007-12-24T08:04:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Creed	 Then you run the smbfuse command
2007-12-24T08:07:00.000Z	Creed	Dr_willis	how do I unmount something?
2007-12-24T08:13:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Creed	 to unnmount the smbfuse tools. I seem to recall using 'sudo umount /path/to/the/fusemountpoint'
