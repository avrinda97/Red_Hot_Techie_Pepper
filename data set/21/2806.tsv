2009-06-12T04:00:00.000Z	Dethroned		Do I need to change unallocated HD space to the same Ext3 format as Ubuntu in order to combine the partitions?
2009-06-12T04:00:00.000Z	utueh	Dethroned	you using lvm?
2009-06-12T04:01:00.000Z	Dethroned		lvm?
2009-06-12T04:01:00.000Z	utueh		linux volume manager
2009-06-12T04:01:00.000Z	Dethroned		GPart
2009-06-12T04:01:00.000Z	utueh	Dethroned	are the partitions side by side?
2009-06-12T04:02:00.000Z	Dethroned	utueh	my linux partition is broken up into 3 parts.  there's 2 2 gig parts and then the swap.  the unallocated is right above the first 2 gig part
2009-06-12T04:02:00.000Z	Dethroned		which I don't think is the actual ubuntu
2009-06-12T04:03:00.000Z	utueh	Dethroned	well, you should be able to delete the second part, then resize the first, though be carefull
2009-06-12T04:04:00.000Z	Dethroned	utueh	 I want to know how to the combine the allocated with the actual ubuntu partition
2009-06-12T04:05:00.000Z	Dethroned		One of the partitions is labeled Extended...the other is EXt3 and the last is swap
2009-06-12T04:05:00.000Z	utueh	Dethroned	my last suggestion should result in you having one big partition, were you to want to combine them look into lvm
2009-06-12T04:05:00.000Z	utueh		though lvm would be pointless from what i have heard of you case
2009-06-12T04:06:00.000Z	Dethroned	utueh	All I want to know is how to combine an unallocated partition with my EXT3 partition...do I need to convert the unallocated to EXT3 in order to combine them?
2009-06-12T04:07:00.000Z	utueh	Dethroned	no, just expand the first is the unallocated is right beside it
2009-06-12T04:07:00.000Z	utueh		expand = resize
2009-06-12T04:07:00.000Z	Dethroned	utueh	 It's above it...they are listed vertically
2009-06-12T04:08:00.000Z	utueh	Dethroned	i have done that before with gparted, worked fine
2009-06-12T04:08:00.000Z	utueh	Dethroned	what partition program are you using, what verioin of ubuntu?
2009-06-12T04:08:00.000Z	Dethroned	utueh	Gpart and 9.04
2009-06-12T04:09:00.000Z	Dethroned	utueh	 Do I want to extend the part of the partition labeled "Extended" or "EXT3"
