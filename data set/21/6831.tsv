2007-01-16T07:49:00.000Z	arrenlex	blueprints88888	Why the million quotes?
2007-01-16T07:50:00.000Z	arrenlex	blueprints88888	We're usually pretty good about reading things on here, despite the large person count.
2007-01-16T07:53:00.000Z	arrenlex	blueprints88888	if you're trying to compile something, you need libncurses5-dev
2007-01-16T08:43:00.000Z	arrenlex	blueprints88888	And the name "your_user_here" doesn't make you suspicious?
2007-01-20T09:39:00.000Z	arrenlex	blueprints88888	lspci | grep audio
2007-01-20T09:39:00.000Z	blueprints88888	arrenlex	Thank You
2007-01-20T09:39:00.000Z	arrenlex	blueprints88888	Also, please, please cut down on your question marks. It is incredibly obnoxious
2007-01-20T09:41:00.000Z	arrenlex	blueprints88888	If nothing happens, it means that your lspci isn't formatted like mine is, and you should just run "lspci" and look through everything it manually to find your sound card.
2007-01-20T09:42:00.000Z	arrenlex	blueprints88888	You could also try running "cat /proc/asound/cards"
2007-01-20T09:42:00.000Z	blueprints88888	arrenlex	ok thanks iwill try that
2007-01-20T09:42:00.000Z	blueprints88888	arrenlex	this was my output for cat         0 [Intel          ] : HDA-Intel - HDA Intel
2007-01-20T09:55:00.000Z	arrenlex	blueprints88888	Isn't Linux cracked up to be a difficult, obfuscated, unpopular OS used by unpopular, unattractive geeks out of deep philosphical considerations?
2007-01-20T09:55:00.000Z	arrenlex	blueprints88888	I think it's exactly what it's cracked up to be.
2007-01-20T09:56:00.000Z	arrenlex	blueprints88888	If you want the slick, shiny OS your grandmother can use without problems, that would be MacOS.
2007-01-20T09:56:00.000Z	arrenlex	blueprints88888	Then use windows.
2007-01-20T09:56:00.000Z	arrenlex	blueprints88888	Then write your own operating system.
