2008-04-08T17:49:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	DJones	it needs to be set to 4
2008-04-08T17:50:00.000Z	DJones	arvind_khadri	thanks, I wasn't sure what the number needed to be
2008-04-08T17:50:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	DJones	and yeah divider is also counted :)
2008-04-08T17:50:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	DJones	the guy seems to be lost somewhere
2008-04-08T17:50:00.000Z	DJones	arvind_khadri	right, that was what was makinig me wonder and why I suggested he get somebody else to confirm it
2008-04-08T17:51:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	DJones	hmm :)
2008-04-10T19:21:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	DJones	:)
2008-04-10T19:56:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	DJones	do they have some irc??
2008-04-10T19:57:00.000Z	DJones	arvind_khadri	I've heard of people using irc via a mobile phone, but I don't know what they used
2008-04-10T19:59:00.000Z	DJones	arvind_khadri	oh right, i don't know
2008-04-15T14:55:00.000Z	DJones	arvind_khadri	That was my suggestion to phrozen77 to see whether it was conflicting with a version in the normal repo's
2008-04-15T14:59:00.000Z	DJones	arvind_khadri	The original problem was that libc6 was being rejected, but thats supposed to be in installable from the the dapper repo's
2008-04-15T14:59:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	DJones	purge build-essential
2008-04-15T15:00:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	DJones	that can be done from the cd
2008-04-15T15:00:00.000Z	DJones	arvind_khadri	its not for me, it was phrozen77's original error message
2008-04-15T15:00:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	DJones	:) i meant it for him only...
2008-04-16T13:40:00.000Z	DJones	arvind_khadri	Just out of interest, did you manage to solve phrozen...'s problem yesterday, I had to go out so missed whether you managed to help him
2008-04-16T13:41:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	DJones	i was able to get his libc6 working and after that he went off
2008-04-16T13:42:00.000Z	DJones	arvind_khadri	thats good
2010-03-26T19:04:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	DJones	too late :)
