2011-08-14T03:35:00.000Z	magpii		ok. i am on my laptop, which is running ubuntu. my pc which
2011-08-14T03:35:00.000Z	magpii		has a fresh install of ubuntu has completley died
2011-08-14T03:36:00.000Z	magpii		no response from cursor, yet it allows me to click on my user name at boot up, and allows me to imput my password via keyboard
2011-08-14T03:36:00.000Z	magpii		the operating system will not accept any m,ouse commands or keyboard.
2011-08-14T03:36:00.000Z	magpii		yet it works fine when logging in
2011-08-14T03:37:00.000Z	magpii		for me, completley died occures when the only option is to reset and reboot
2011-08-14T03:38:00.000Z	magpii		the mouse and keyboard work fine when logging in. but as soon as the opertaing system is loaded, input becomes obsolete
2011-08-14T03:40:00.000Z	jayson_r	magpii	are you using a desktop or laptop?
2011-08-14T03:43:00.000Z	jayson_r	magpii	so, your keyboard doesn't work either?
2011-08-14T03:43:00.000Z	jayson_r	magpii	normally you'd switch tty sessions w/ ctrl+f1, f2, etc., but you can't w/o a keyboard :-)
2011-08-14T03:43:00.000Z	jayson_r	magpii	can you try ctrl+f1 just to see if anything happens?
2011-08-14T03:44:00.000Z	jayson_r	magpii	sorry ctrl+alt+f1
2011-08-14T03:46:00.000Z	jayson_r	magpii	after
2011-08-14T03:46:00.000Z	jayson_r	magpii	when it seems the keyboard isn't working, try ctrl+alt+F1 anyway, just to see
2011-08-14T03:49:00.000Z	jayson_r	magpii	w00t!
2011-08-14T03:50:00.000Z	jayson_r	magpii	can you log in at the command line after ctrl+alt+F1
2011-08-14T03:53:00.000Z	jayson_r	magpii	do you know what kind of video card you have?
2011-08-14T03:53:00.000Z	jayson_r	magpii	is that data on another partition other than what you installed ubuntu on?
2011-08-14T03:54:00.000Z	jayson_r	magpii	trying to see what drivers you might have installed - that's why
2011-08-14T03:55:00.000Z	jayson_r	magpii	i think it's video driver related
2011-08-14T03:56:00.000Z	jayson_r	magpii	if the gui is frozen, then yes :-)
