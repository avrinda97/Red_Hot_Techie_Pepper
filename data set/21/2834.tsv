2010-01-02T23:17:00.000Z	azrael_		hey i need sum help installing flash on ubuntu anyone know the yum command
2010-01-02T23:17:00.000Z	edbian	azrael_	How are you using yum on ubuntu?
2010-01-02T23:37:00.000Z	edbian	azrael_	tyvm ??
2010-01-02T23:40:00.000Z	edbian	azrael_	did you want something?
2010-01-03T03:29:00.000Z	edbian	azrael_	You have another instance of a package manager open
2010-01-03T03:30:00.000Z	edbian	azrael_	You'll get better!  Everyone starts where you are now
2010-01-03T03:47:00.000Z	edbian	azrael_	I think I can.  Are you trying to get it to work in firefox??
2010-01-03T03:47:00.000Z	edbian	azrael_	Open up synaptic.  Do you know what that is?  and search for "flash"
2010-01-03T03:49:00.000Z	edbian	azrael_	Ok, first un-install EVERYTHING that comes up from the search for "flash" you can only have 1 version of flash installed or they fight each other and it won't work.
2010-01-03T03:49:00.000Z	edbian	azrael_	what is showing as installed? just flashplugin-nonfree   ?
2010-01-03T03:49:00.000Z	edbian	azrael_	so now there is no flash players installed?
2010-01-03T03:50:00.000Z	edbian	azrael_	Organize the packages by what's installed.  It is critical that none of them are installed right now
2010-01-03T03:51:00.000Z	edbian	azrael_	ok good.  Now you have a couple options.  There is the version from adobe (flashplugin-nonfree) if you're convinced that doesn't work I suggest gnash it's second best in my opinion but be warned flashplugin-nonfree is the best by far and works on the most sites
2010-01-03T03:52:00.000Z	edbian	azrael_	try gnash it works on youtube at least
2010-01-03T03:54:00.000Z	edbian	azrael_	You install gnash, restarted firefox completely and then tried you tube?
2010-01-03T03:54:00.000Z	edbian	azrael_	It is possible that firefox is not completely restarting.  Look in it's plugins what is showing as the flash player?
2010-01-03T04:38:00.000Z	edbian	azrael_	Try installing the -dev do you understand?  It's a good idea hyperstream! :)
2010-01-03T04:39:00.000Z	edbian	azrael_	sudo apt-get install  libpango1.0-dev
2010-01-03T04:40:00.000Z	edbian	azrael_	from gdebi still?
2010-01-03T04:40:00.000Z	edbian	azrael_	ha ha
2010-01-03T04:41:00.000Z	edbian	azrael_	See our personal convo
