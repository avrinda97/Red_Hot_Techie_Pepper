2012-09-06T14:26:00.000Z	mr_linux		hello room Question: i have 2 linux installations , 11.10 and 10.04 dual boot, how can i run programs/binaries  from 10.04 while being in 11.10 and vice versa
2012-09-06T14:27:00.000Z	ikonia	mr_linux	realistic answer is "don't"
2012-09-06T14:27:00.000Z	mr_linux	ikonia	thanks for reply, i just want to be able to "run" binaries from other installation
2012-09-06T14:27:00.000Z	ikonia	mr_linux	yes and the answer is "don't"
2012-09-06T14:28:00.000Z	mr_linux	ikonia	thanks but what can happen in worst case? or in normal case?
2012-09-06T14:28:00.000Z	ikonia	mr_linux	break things
2012-09-06T14:28:00.000Z	mr_linux	ikonia	i am prepared to take this risk,
2012-09-06T14:28:00.000Z	ikonia	mr_linux	then do it
2012-09-06T14:29:00.000Z	mr_linux	ikonia	it does not run
2012-09-06T14:29:00.000Z	ikonia	mr_linux	as I told you it won't
2012-09-06T14:29:00.000Z	mr_linux	ikonia	lol did any1  else tried it before if yes please guide me to some article , or maybe i am the only crazy one
2012-09-06T14:29:00.000Z	ikonia	mr_linux	no-one does this, because it's wrong
2012-09-06T14:30:00.000Z	ikonia	mr_linux	and as you've found, doesn't work
2012-09-06T14:30:00.000Z	mr_linux	ikonia	i thought with linux nothing is impossible :)
2012-09-06T14:31:00.000Z	ikonia	mr_linux	then you thought wrong. It's an OS the same as any other with rules and limitations
2012-09-06T14:31:00.000Z	mr_linux	ikonia	can you guide me to some article which suggest why won't it work or how binaries work ? or why can't binaries work standalone , for my better understanding
2012-09-06T14:32:00.000Z	ikonia	mr_linux	because they are built and linked against a different distro
2012-09-06T14:32:00.000Z	ikonia	mr_linux	pretty much the bottom line of it
2012-09-06T14:33:00.000Z	ikonia	mr_linux	you can't do that,
2012-09-06T14:33:00.000Z	ikonia	mr_linux	but if you wish to try, go for it
2012-09-06T14:33:00.000Z	mr_linux	ikonia	thanks :)
