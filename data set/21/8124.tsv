2006-06-01T10:31:00.000Z	hazart		Will, the dapper repository stay "stable" and not upgrade package versions? In other words, should i add any edgy sources to my list?
2006-06-01T10:32:00.000Z	hazart		Will the dapper repos. still contain new packages, or will there be a new one for edgy?
2006-06-01T10:33:00.000Z	krazykit	hazart	it'll be fairly stable.  bug fixes and security fixes will be added, and there will be backports eventually.  for right now, there are no edgy repos
2006-06-01T10:33:00.000Z	krazykit	hazart	edgy won't be started on for a couple weeks yet, i hear.
2006-06-01T10:33:00.000Z	hazart	krazykit	okay, but if i don't change my sources i will be stuck with gnome 2.14 and the current version apps that i have now?
2006-06-01T10:34:00.000Z	krazykit	hazart	um, yes... gnome 2.14 is the latest, you know.  you're not really "stuck" with it.
2006-06-01T10:35:00.000Z	krazykit	hazart	if you really want to be on the edge, wait for edgy eft to get it's repos started and migrate to that.
2006-06-01T10:35:00.000Z	hazart	krazykit	yes, it know, but i would like to have the 2.15.1 whenever it's released, if you know what i mean...
2006-06-01T10:35:00.000Z	krazykit	hazart	hah, than wait for edgy.  you'll last a few weeks til' it's up :-P
2006-06-01T10:36:00.000Z	hazart	krazykit	okay, that's nice! I really love the simplicity og the ubuntu/debian package system :)
2006-06-01T10:36:00.000Z	krazykit	hazart	just remember, edgy will by syncing with debian sid, and it'll be rather unstable at first.
2006-06-01T10:36:00.000Z	hazart	krazykit	it's just that i just switched my amd64 from gentoo to ubunty, and i am used to run breakmygentoo overlays, so i miss the edge :P
2006-06-01T10:38:00.000Z	hazart	krazykit	But maybe it's time to settle down for some stability after all :D - ubuntu really offers a bit of everything. The only thing i miss is the ability to select which features packages should come with. Like gentoo's USE flags.
2006-06-01T10:39:00.000Z	krazykit	hazart	hrm, it used to be a supported migration path, but it might be easier to just reinstall
2006-06-01T10:39:00.000Z	krazykit	hazart	no, there's no supported path for that.
2006-06-01T10:40:00.000Z	krazykit	hazart	if you try to do that, i'll guarantee breakage.  but go ahead and try!  it'll be fun.
2006-06-01T10:40:00.000Z	hazart	krazykit	Hehe, no, it's an important production system.
2006-06-01T10:41:00.000Z	hazart	krazykit	to bad we don't have a spare machine for seamless migration. We really need SATA support in it soon, and that reguires 2.6 kernel.
2006-06-01T10:41:00.000Z	hazart	krazykit	and debian unstable is just not the same as dapper LTS.
2006-06-01T10:42:00.000Z	krazykit	hazart	i know.
2006-06-01T10:42:00.000Z	hazart	krazykit	got to go grab some coffe and start reading math, thanks for your support.
