2010-05-29T10:07:00.000Z	bazhang	nomnex	you are trying to use debian packages with Ubuntu? please clarify
2010-05-29T10:07:00.000Z	nomnex	bazhang	can you take a look there https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bluefish/+bug/540126, comment #8, thank you
2010-05-29T10:09:00.000Z	nomnex	bazhang	nope, it's in there already, but I have delete the his key and I don't know how to get it back
2010-05-29T10:10:00.000Z	bazhang	nomnex	you wish to add the key for the PPA?
2010-05-29T10:10:00.000Z	nomnex	bazhang	yes
2010-05-29T10:10:00.000Z	bazhang	nomnex	what command did you use to add the repo? it should import the key automatically if used correctly
2010-05-29T10:11:00.000Z	nomnex	bazhang	line 7 http://paste.ubuntu.com/441208/
2010-05-29T10:12:00.000Z	nomnex	bazhang	the key has been imported but I have deleted by mistake
2010-05-29T10:14:00.000Z	nomnex	bazhang	did you see error msg on line 5, http://paste.ubuntu.com/441208/?
2010-05-29T10:14:00.000Z	bazhang	nomnex	the normal way to add PPA repos is the one I gave you above (substituting the appropriate info of course)
2010-05-29T10:14:00.000Z	nomnex	bazhang	I know how to install and PPA, it is installed, the key was also here, but i have deleted
2010-05-29T10:15:00.000Z	nomnex	bazhang	does it make sens?
2010-05-29T10:15:00.000Z	bazhang	nomnex	what about removing and updating, then re-adding the PPA and updating once more
2010-05-29T10:16:00.000Z	nomnex	bazhang	I just need to re-import the key, I can do that when it is keyserver.ubuntu.com, but that does not work with the debian server
2010-05-29T10:16:00.000Z	nomnex	bazhang	do you have an idea how to do it?
2010-05-29T10:16:00.000Z	bazhang	nomnex	I would do as I just suggested
2010-05-29T10:17:00.000Z	nomnex	bazhang	i will try my luck on the gnupgp channel, thanks anyway.
2010-05-29T10:31:00.000Z	nomnex	bazhang	I got the key back, case solved (the easy way).
