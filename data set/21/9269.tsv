2005-10-26T16:00:00.000Z	logikal		and owned myself.
2005-10-26T16:01:00.000Z	logikal		find: *.jpg: No such file or directory
2005-10-26T16:02:00.000Z	mustard5	logikal	would the search function in 'Places' work if you navigated to the directory you have your partion mounted on?
2005-10-26T16:04:00.000Z	mustard5	logikal	in your HOME directory I would say
2005-10-26T16:04:00.000Z	mustard5	logikal	no idea...My Documents?
2005-10-30T08:15:00.000Z	mustard5	logikal	this may be irrelevant but wonder whether you can mount the camera and simply browse the directory that contains the files and copy and paste them out
2005-10-30T08:15:00.000Z	logikal	mustard5	the camera is mounted, I see no files.
2005-10-30T08:16:00.000Z	logikal	mustard5	the camera is mounted, I can't see the files.
2005-10-30T08:16:00.000Z	mustard5	logikal	I'll see what I can find online....
2005-10-30T08:26:00.000Z	mustard5	logikal	the only thing I could find was a bugzilla report on a different HP camera model ......  https://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=12132
2005-10-30T08:27:00.000Z	logikal	mustard5	Im trying GTKan
2005-10-30T08:27:00.000Z	mustard5	logikal	perhaps you may have a bug too
2005-10-30T08:30:00.000Z	mustard5	logikal	I would be investigating whether you have discovered a bug and enquire about what process you need to use to file a bug report in the hope that it will be fixed
