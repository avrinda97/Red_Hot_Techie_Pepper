2010-05-19T07:49:00.000Z	ripdisk		someone please tell me how to stop my old geforce drivers to stop loading
2010-05-19T07:49:00.000Z	ripdisk		because i'm trying to use a radeon now

2010-05-19T07:54:00.000Z	kahoot	ripdisk	have you tried blacklisting the driver? or am I misunderstanding your problem?
2010-05-19T07:55:00.000Z	ripdisk	kahoot	i used to have a geforce and i switched my card.. but the geforce driver keeps loading so ubuntu won't load any other drivers
2010-05-19T07:57:00.000Z	ripdisk	kahoot	are we on the same page then? what's blacklisting
2010-05-19T07:58:00.000Z	kahoot	ripdisk	blacklisting is simply stopping a driver from starting up on boot.. I'm not sure if it would help or not
2010-05-19T07:58:00.000Z	kahoot	ripdisk	there is a script file somewhere to do it, but I can't remember the directory..
2010-05-19T07:58:00.000Z	ripdisk		oh ok
2010-05-19T07:58:00.000Z	ripdisk		maybe someone else can help me
2010-05-19T07:58:00.000Z	ripdisk		it seems like it would be simple
2010-05-19T07:58:00.000Z	ripdisk		all i'm doing is changing my video cards
2010-05-19T07:59:00.000Z	ripdisk		i don't see why ubuntu is doing this

2010-05-19T07:59:00.000Z	ripdisk		and i can't try to run any other drivers
2010-05-19T07:59:00.000Z	ripdisk		please help, this is annoying
2010-05-19T08:02:00.000Z	kahoot	ripdisk	This is all I could find, maybe it's a start anyway. the blacklist directory is in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
