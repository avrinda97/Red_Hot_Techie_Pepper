2009-06-16T08:25:00.000Z	ubuntunoobneedin		yes my drive is full why can't i delete stuff
2009-06-16T08:27:00.000Z	coz_	ubuntunoobneedin	  check in Home /.local/share/Trash
2009-06-16T08:28:00.000Z	coz_	ubuntunoobneedin	 maybe you can delete some files manually from there
2009-06-16T08:32:00.000Z	coz_	ubuntunoobneedin	 did you check in that location?
2009-06-16T08:32:00.000Z	ubuntunoobneedin	coz_	yes it will not delete anywhere when i try it freazes
2009-06-16T08:34:00.000Z	coz_	ubuntunoobneedin	 mmm  open a terminal and cd  /home/yourname/.local/share/Trash  then do ls   and try  sudo rm -rf nameoffile
2009-06-16T08:35:00.000Z	coz_	ubuntunoobneedin	 can you delete any useless. info at all?  movies   music etc ?  or can you back some of them up.?
2009-06-16T08:36:00.000Z	coz_	ubuntunoobneedin	 did you try    sudo rm -rf ~/.local/share/Trash/files/*
2009-06-16T08:36:00.000Z	coz_	ubuntunoobneedin	in terminal ^^^
2009-06-16T08:37:00.000Z	ubuntunoobneedin	coz_	what was it supposed to do that gave me no errors
2009-06-16T08:37:00.000Z	coz_	ubuntunoobneedin	 if that doesnt work  open the terminal and  gksu nautilus   then maneuver to the  location in home  and see if you can delete them then
2009-06-16T08:38:00.000Z	coz_	ubuntunoobneedin	 that should have removed all files under  Trash/files
2009-06-16T08:38:00.000Z	coz_	ubuntunoobneedin	 however when you gksy nautilus it will open the root diretory so click File system  then home  then your name etc etc
2009-06-16T08:39:00.000Z	coz_	ubuntunoobneedin	 sorry gksudo nautilus
2009-06-16T08:45:00.000Z	ubuntunoobneedin	coz_	that sudo command you gave me worked everything seems to be working again thank you so much
2009-06-16T08:45:00.000Z	coz_	ubuntunoobneedin	 very cool :)
2009-06-16T08:46:00.000Z	coz_	ubuntunoobneedin	i would save that command in a text file for later use :)
