2008-02-16T08:24:00.000Z	deniz_	mahmoud2	the network restart thing gives "failed to bring up wlan0" and the ifconfig ppp0 and eth0 both give the same result: "error fetching interface information: device not found"
2008-02-16T08:26:00.000Z	mahmoud2	deniz_	: if eth0 is not found, then your laptop Ethernet is not working properly / not detected  ..
2008-02-16T08:29:00.000Z	deniz_	mahmoud2	its not defective so it must be not detected...doesnt wired connections have super good  reputation of being detected in ubuntu? and btw laptop said that it got connected to desktop doesnt mean that the ethernet port works??

2008-02-16T08:31:00.000Z	mahmoud2	deniz_	lspci | grep Ethernet
2008-02-16T08:32:00.000Z	deniz_	mahmoud2	both do same thing
2008-02-16T08:34:00.000Z	deniz_	mahmoud2	destination gateway genmask glags metric ref use iface then next line link-local gateway * 255.255.0.0 U 0 0 0 eth1 default * 0.0.0.0 U 1000 0 0 eth1
