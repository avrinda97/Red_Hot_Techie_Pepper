2010-07-29T06:17:00.000Z	neutralrobotboy		hmm... so i guess nobody can point me in the right direction? is more information needed?
2010-07-29T06:17:00.000Z	arrrghhh	neutralrobotboy	have you tried rebooting?   this happens every time you try to hibernate?
2010-07-29T06:20:00.000Z	neutralrobotboy	arrrghhh	i have tried rebooting. i think i screwed up somewhere in the install. basically, i installed without a swap partition because i have plenty of ram. i didn't realize at the time that hibernate required a swap partition to work (silly me). i think i then mounted a swap file, which enabled hibernate, but caused the error+crash when i tried to use it. i then repartitioned, putting a swap partition an the end of the drive
2010-07-29T06:21:00.000Z	arrrghhh	neutralrobotboy	how big is the swap?
2010-07-29T06:21:00.000Z	neutralrobotboy	arrrghhh	the partition is about 6 gigs.
2010-07-29T06:22:00.000Z	arrrghhh	neutralrobotboy	your swap is 6gb?  how much RAM do you have?
2010-07-29T06:22:00.000Z	neutralrobotboy	arrrghhh	about 3gb
2010-07-29T06:22:00.000Z	arrrghhh	neutralrobotboy	that should be more than enough....
2010-07-29T06:23:00.000Z	neutralrobotboy	arrrghhh	it's giving me some weird error message about a bad swap header. is there a way to pull up that error message from the console?
2010-07-29T06:24:00.000Z	arrrghhh	neutralrobotboy	check your logs.  /var/log/messages or syslog.
2010-07-29T06:28:00.000Z	neutralrobotboy	arrrghhh	one example is from syslog.1: http://pastebin.com/C1GPdysK
2010-07-29T06:29:00.000Z	arrrghhh	neutralrobotboy	can you give me more before & after?
2010-07-29T06:29:00.000Z	neutralrobotboy	arrrghhh	sure. sorry.
2010-07-29T06:30:00.000Z	arrrghhh	neutralrobotboy	forget it.  quick google turned up this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1042946
2010-07-29T06:30:00.000Z	neutralrobotboy	arrrghhh	 aha! looking.
2010-07-29T06:31:00.000Z	arrrghhh	neutralrobotboy	that was the first link on google when i searched "swap header not found"
2010-07-29T06:33:00.000Z	neutralrobotboy	arrrghhh	no offense taken. if i've been boneheaded, it's my own fault.
2010-07-29T06:33:00.000Z	arrrghhh	neutralrobotboy	lol no worries.   we all have our moments.
2010-07-29T06:37:00.000Z	neutralrobotboy	arrrghhh	hmm... this details how to make hibernate work with swapfiles. what's probably happening is that i still have an active swapfile somewhere. since i have a swap partition, i don't need that anymore. is there a simple way to just turn off the swapfile altogether?
2010-07-29T06:38:00.000Z	arrrghhh	neutralrobotboy	i'd follow that guide.
2010-07-29T06:38:00.000Z	neutralrobotboy	arrrghhh	 okie dokey. thanks!
