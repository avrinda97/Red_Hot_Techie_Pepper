2006-03-19T07:26:00.000Z	LinuxJones	blrich	delete the .iceauthority file using sudo and then re-login
2006-03-19T07:27:00.000Z	blrich	LinuxJones	did that, hasn't worked
2006-03-19T07:27:00.000Z	blrich	LinuxJones	lull I also can't sudo because it says it can't lookup my host
2006-03-19T07:27:00.000Z	LinuxJones	blrich	you re-started the login manager after deleting the file ?
2006-03-19T07:27:00.000Z	blrich	LinuxJones	lull but i haven't changed the /etc/hosts file
2006-03-19T07:28:00.000Z	blrich	LinuxJones	yep, del'd everything, del'd the .DCOPserver files, del'd .kde/tmp* and socket* and so on, del'd /tmp/*
2006-03-19T07:28:00.000Z	blrich	LinuxJones	nothing seems to work
2006-03-19T07:28:00.000Z	LinuxJones	blrich	do it from a virtual terminal (ie ctrl + alt + F3) once you delete the file /etc/init.d/gdm restart then login normally
2006-03-19T07:31:00.000Z	LinuxJones	blrich	the .iceauthority file will be re-created when you login to your system
2006-03-19T07:33:00.000Z	LinuxJones	blrich	heh
2006-03-19T07:33:00.000Z	LinuxJones	blrich	how did that happen ?
2006-03-19T07:33:00.000Z	blrich	LinuxJones	my senile 54yo developer father stuffed it up on his new kubuntu system and i've been trying to fix it for an hour
2006-03-19T07:34:00.000Z	LinuxJones	blrich	haha
2006-03-19T07:34:00.000Z	blrich	LinuxJones	that would explain why the prompt always came up as user@richcorp<nl>localhost$
2006-03-19T07:35:00.000Z	LinuxJones	blrich	yeah your not from the Netherlands :)
2006-03-19T07:35:00.000Z	blrich	LinuxJones	no <nl> = \n  newline i mean
2006-03-19T07:35:00.000Z	LinuxJones	blrich	yeah I know that was a lame attempt at humour :P
2006-03-19T07:36:00.000Z	blrich	LinuxJones	=P
