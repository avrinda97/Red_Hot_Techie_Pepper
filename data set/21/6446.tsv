2007-03-30T15:37:00.000Z	ROD		[WaZ] , and that's it
2007-03-30T15:38:00.000Z	ROD		[WaZ] , yes.
2007-03-30T15:38:00.000Z	ROD		[WaZ] , well not a dot

2007-03-30T15:39:00.000Z	ROD		[WaZ] , right click yields CHECK Enable Networking
2007-03-30T15:39:00.000Z	ROD		but again. just the wired.
2007-03-30T15:40:00.000Z	ROD		[WaZ] , oh okay. so basically eth0 has no wireless extension. ath0 does.
2007-03-30T15:40:00.000Z	ROD		but i don't know how to switch to ath0
2007-03-30T15:40:00.000Z	ROD		[WaZ] , how do i get it to connect to ath0?
2007-03-30T15:41:00.000Z	ulisse	ROD	try in a terminal: sudo iwlist ath0 scan
2007-03-30T15:41:00.000Z	ROD	ulisse	it sscanned a bunch
2007-03-30T15:42:00.000Z	ulisse	ROD	id you get any result of the scan? Networks, i mean
2007-03-30T15:42:00.000Z	ROD	ulisse	it gave me many, one of which is mine
2007-03-30T15:43:00.000Z	ulisse	ROD	open /etc/network/interfaces and comment out all what is related to the wireless card
2007-03-30T15:44:00.000Z	ROD	ulisse	hmm okay.
2007-03-30T15:44:00.000Z	ulisse	ROD	that basically is the same of what said [WaZ] , only in the terminal :)
2007-03-30T15:46:00.000Z	ROD	ulisse	when I comment out stuff, what exactly do I comment out? I do that with /* or something right?
2007-03-30T15:46:00.000Z	ulisse	ROD	with #
2007-03-30T15:49:00.000Z	ulisse	ROD	no problem, it's easy to recreate the config, if needed
2007-03-30T15:50:00.000Z	ulisse	ROD	maybe you have to restart networking
