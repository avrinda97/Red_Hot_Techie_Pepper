2007-10-16T13:24:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Alan	you are in feisty i assume?
2007-10-16T13:25:00.000Z	Alan	MasterShrek	yes
2007-10-16T13:25:00.000Z	Alan	MasterShrek	what model do you have?
2007-10-16T13:27:00.000Z	Alan	MasterShrek	i have a 4309, and its so bad it makes ndiswrapper panic my kernel when i try and load it...  the closest bcm43xx + fwcutter gets me a 4306 driver
2007-10-16T13:27:00.000Z	Alan	MasterShrek	and i can't get g from it...
2007-10-16T13:27:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Alan	i think u need a newer kernel, when and if you upgrade to gutsy you shold be in better shape
2007-10-16T13:28:00.000Z	Alan	MasterShrek	newer kernel? why?
2007-10-16T13:28:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Alan	new kernel, newer bcm43xx driver

2007-10-16T13:29:00.000Z	Alan	MasterShrek	oh, i see....  I'll try that then!
2007-10-16T13:29:00.000Z	Alan	MasterShrek	is it safe to upgrade to the RC yet?
2007-10-16T13:29:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Alan	it runs fine
2007-10-16T13:30:00.000Z	Alan	MasterShrek	if i have the opportunity, am i better off doing a clean install of gutsy?
