2007-08-24T15:58:00.000Z	tonyduke		you mean a tool by which u can scan your filesystem and build a database automatically?
2007-08-24T15:59:00.000Z	monokrome	tonyduke	I want to scan my filesystem and set tags automatically, ideally.
2007-08-24T15:59:00.000Z	tonyduke		understood
2007-08-24T15:59:00.000Z	monokrome		Been looking for an appropriate app for a bit now. Know any?
2007-08-24T15:59:00.000Z	tonyduke		I am looking for it too.
2007-08-24T15:59:00.000Z	monokrome		Cool.
2007-08-24T16:00:00.000Z	tonyduke		exciurus, but its just a core. not a tool yet.
2007-08-24T16:01:00.000Z	monokrome		I found EasyTag might work
2007-08-24T16:01:00.000Z	tonyduke		The author encourages funs to develope a front.
2007-08-24T16:02:00.000Z	monokrome		Wewt. And easytag supports flac!
2007-08-24T16:02:00.000Z	tonyduke		oh, your library is a music lib.
2007-08-24T16:03:00.000Z	monokrome	tonyduke	eh?
2007-08-24T16:03:00.000Z	tonyduke		your lib? what's in it?
2007-08-24T16:04:00.000Z	monokrome	tonyduke	120GB of music, 80G of videos.
2007-08-24T16:05:00.000Z	tonyduke		oh! mine is ebooks
2007-08-24T16:05:00.000Z	tonyduke		misunderstood, :-)
2007-08-24T16:06:00.000Z	monokrome	tonyduke	EasyTag looks usable!
2007-08-24T16:08:00.000Z	tonyduke	monokrome	got u, thanks. but i have dozens of DVD rom stored ebooks, so i need a library admin tools to handle it.
2007-08-24T16:08:00.000Z	monokrome	tonyduke	oh my. :|
2007-08-24T16:09:00.000Z	tonyduke		i dont store music files, cause i can find it at anytime anywhere
2007-08-24T16:11:00.000Z	tonyduke	monokrome	there is a world wide music sharing networks, do u really need to store the huge amount of music or videos?
