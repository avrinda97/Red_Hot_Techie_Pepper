2008-04-01T11:50:00.000Z	sphinxx		is possible to network drives between ubuntu and windows xp?
2008-04-01T11:50:00.000Z	sphinxx		so they can see each other
2008-04-01T11:50:00.000Z	sphinxx		over a network
2008-04-01T11:50:00.000Z	sphinxx		im new as you can tell
2008-04-01T11:51:00.000Z	sphinxx		i just installed ubuntu 7.10, what are the first steps i need to take now?
2008-04-01T11:51:00.000Z	hischild	sphinxx	enjoy the best OS ever.
2008-04-01T11:53:00.000Z	hischild	sphinxx	no need. The system you have now is just perfect. What do you want to do? perhaps then we can suggest some packages.
2008-04-01T11:53:00.000Z	hischild	sphinxx	that's done by default. Anything else?
2008-04-01T11:53:00.000Z	hischild	sphinxx	go to network and see if you see the xp box.
2008-04-01T12:00:00.000Z	sphinxx	hischild	ill rephrase, what do I need to do to ensure all my ports are closed
2008-04-01T12:00:00.000Z	hischild	sphinxx	you don't need anything. If you want to control your firewall, google for an iptables tutorial.
2008-04-01T12:05:00.000Z	hischild	sphinxx	they are closed by default.
2008-04-01T12:06:00.000Z	hischild	sphinxx	you can use firestarter to check your firewall and stuff, or set up your own using iptables.
2008-04-01T12:10:00.000Z	hischild	sphinxx	yes
2008-04-01T12:11:00.000Z	hischild	sphinxx	USE your OS, instead of spending hours finding everything you need to get it to work.
2008-04-01T12:12:00.000Z	hischild	sphinxx	windows takes me about 3 hours to get it working with drivers (vista that is, for xp is not possible due to lack of drivers) and then i don't have any programs. Ubuntu takes me 20 min for the install, and 40 min for the updates.
2008-04-01T12:15:00.000Z	hischild	sphinxx	firestarter iirc
2008-04-01T12:53:00.000Z	hischild	sphinxx	yes.
2008-04-01T13:03:00.000Z	hischild	sphinxx	if you scan yourself, you'll also see the local ports.
2008-04-01T13:22:00.000Z	sphinxx	hischild	its stuff like this that makes me overwhelmed
2008-04-01T13:52:00.000Z	hischild	sphinxx	you've probably made a type with install. Try it again.
