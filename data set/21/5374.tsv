2007-10-27T11:09:00.000Z	joseph		Anybody had any luck with compiz on a ATI Mobile Radion 200?
2007-10-27T11:09:00.000Z	CubeXombi	joseph	HAHAHAH!! you are inluck
2007-10-27T11:10:00.000Z	CubeXombi	joseph	I can get you a link with VERY besic instructions
2007-10-27T11:10:00.000Z	CubeXombi	joseph	however the new drivers dropped supprot for our cards.
2007-10-27T11:11:00.000Z	joseph	CubeXombi	I can't get it to work with the restricted drivers
2007-10-27T11:11:00.000Z	CubeXombi	joseph	It's not supposed to work thats why..
2007-10-27T11:11:00.000Z	joseph		It's a laptop so I guess if it is a major pain I'll survive without
2007-10-27T11:11:00.000Z	joseph		It worked flawless in pclos
2007-10-27T11:12:00.000Z	CubeXombi	joseph	however there are things that need to be done to enable aiglx with the radeo driver in our case.. works pretty good
2007-10-27T11:12:00.000Z	joseph		What I'd rather fix than compiz is the darn no boot splash screen problem
2007-10-27T11:12:00.000Z	CubeXombi	joseph	I just scribbled this up for someone with a 9800 but it applies to you http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/42330/
2007-10-27T11:13:00.000Z	CubeXombi	joseph	as far as the nosplash.. I can sorta fix it .. if you're refering to the 3+ minute boot time
2007-10-27T11:14:00.000Z	joseph		Cube I have to hit ALT f1 then I can see boot info even if it is text
2007-10-27T11:16:00.000Z	CubeXombi	joseph	as far as thats concerned it's just that the usplash kinda craps out on this V-card it appears.. so what you can do is take a look at my /etc/grub/menu.lst and take off the junk at the end..
2007-10-27T11:17:00.000Z	CubeXombi		joseph> check out my menu.lst http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/42324/ my laptop boots in about 43 seconds now .. the splash is gone but there's no delay
2007-10-27T11:18:00.000Z	CubeXombi		<linuxn00b314>it's the "Ubuntu" Loading screan.. if you boot and all you get is black.. you should remove that
2007-10-27T11:19:00.000Z	CubeXombi		<linuxn00b314> just a flasking cursor?
2007-10-27T11:19:00.000Z	CubeXombi		linuxn00b314>what video card you have?
2007-10-27T11:20:00.000Z	CubeXombi		linuxn00b314> take a look at my menu.lst, i don't get a splash but at least i can see whats going on
2007-10-27T11:21:00.000Z	CubeXombi		linuxn00b314> check out my menu.lst http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/42324/ m
