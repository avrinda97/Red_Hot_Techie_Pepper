2008-06-07T16:11:00.000Z	LimCore		how can I un-noobify ubuntu bootup? remove the splash,  make kernel bootup to be on VT1 not on VT8 etc?
2008-06-07T16:12:00.000Z	soundray	LimCore	use debian instead
2008-06-07T16:12:00.000Z	LimCore	soundray	I dont work in museum
2008-06-07T16:13:00.000Z	soundray	LimCore	that comment shows an extraordinary lack of knowledge
2008-06-07T16:13:00.000Z	LimCore	soundray	Im overall more happy with ubuntu, but I would like to have normal bootup. what you dont understand?
2008-06-07T16:14:00.000Z	soundray	LimCore	I understand very well, and I dislike your attitude, so I will stop this conversation here.
2008-06-07T16:14:00.000Z	LimCore	soundray	excelent; you cold also hold the first non-merritofical comment
2008-06-10T14:07:00.000Z	soundray	LimCore	what a loaded question. Perhaps you just can't configure it properly
2008-06-10T14:08:00.000Z	LimCore	soundray	well if I start ntp then I would expect my time to be synchronized... how to cionfigure it then
2008-06-10T14:08:00.000Z	soundray	LimCore	no, that's not what ntp is for
2008-06-10T14:10:00.000Z	soundray	LimCore	Ubuntu synchronizes automatically with a timeserver when the defaultroute network interface goes up. That's the default setup
2008-06-10T14:13:00.000Z	LimCore	soundray	no, it does not do that auto synchronization by default
2008-06-10T14:14:00.000Z	LimCore	soundray	then what for is ntp?
2008-06-10T14:15:00.000Z	LimCore	soundray	man ntpd says that its a deamon which sets and maintains system time and date... thats exacly what I want
2008-06-10T14:16:00.000Z	soundray	LimCore	it's for time synchronization all right. The package that syncs your host with an internet timeserver, though, is ntpdate. And its default setup is fine. You're not supposed to install ntpd unless you know exactly what you are doing
2008-06-10T15:23:00.000Z	soundray	LimCore	reporting a bug before you've understood the basics of your problem is trolling.
2008-06-10T15:23:00.000Z	LimCore	soundray	I understood the problem well enough to see what causes the bug.  Unless you can point some mistake in this reasoning?
2008-06-10T15:24:00.000Z	soundray	LimCore	the mistake in this reasoning is that there is no bug.
2008-08-10T23:02:00.000Z	soundray	LimCore	is there anything to fix your repeated rude behaviour?
2008-08-10T23:03:00.000Z	LimCore	soundray	yes, fix ubuntu. Plus I dont think calling failure a failure is rude. Only honest
2008-08-10T23:04:00.000Z	soundray	LimCore	for a way to approach a bunch of volunteers for free support, it's incredibly rude.
