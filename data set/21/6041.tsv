2007-06-13T13:15:00.000Z	phalcon	ikonia	i thought they were case sensitive.  i know linux is
2007-06-13T13:16:00.000Z	ikonia	phalcon	they all are - thats what I just said
2007-06-13T13:16:00.000Z	ikonia	phalcon	re-read
2007-06-13T13:17:00.000Z	phalcon	ikonia	indeed, i did.
2007-06-13T13:18:00.000Z	ikonia	phalcon	I said I can't believe anyone would design an app for a unix os thats case insensitive
2007-06-13T13:18:00.000Z	phalcon	ikonia	i gotcha...it's just the wording that threw me off
2007-06-13T13:18:00.000Z	ikonia	phalcon	no problem
2007-06-13T14:10:00.000Z	phalcon	ikonia	what browswer would you reccomend using over and ssh connection?  not lynx or anything CLI.  i'm forwarding X to my work desktop from my home computer
2007-06-13T14:10:00.000Z	phalcon	ikonia	 want to be able to visit ebay, etc.
2007-06-13T14:11:00.000Z	phalcon	ikonia	it goes too slow.  my net connection only u/ls at 1.5 Mb/s.  was hoping there was something lightweight that still handled graphics and whatnot
2007-06-13T14:12:00.000Z	phalcon	ikonia	konqueror is slightly better, but still pretty sluggish
2007-06-13T14:12:00.000Z	ikonia	phalcon	just live with it,
2007-06-13T14:15:00.000Z	phalcon	ikonia	i would if it were livable.  > 3 minutes for google.com to come up, though, isn't very livable.
2007-06-13T14:15:00.000Z	ikonia	phalcon	x over the internet is slow
2007-06-13T14:16:00.000Z	phalcon	ikonia	when i tried it with an up link of 2.5 Mb/s it was pdg, with konqueror anyway.  just hoped there was a browser around that was specifically for that application, just couldn't find one.
2007-06-13T14:17:00.000Z	phalcon	ikonia	also of note, pidgin works just as fast over the net as it does locally
2007-06-13T14:18:00.000Z	ikonia	phalcon	its a lighter app - less to do
2007-06-13T14:18:00.000Z	phalcon	ikonia	 i'll give links2 a try. many thanks.
2007-06-13T14:21:00.000Z	phalcon	ikonia	 works like a charm.  thanks, again.
2007-06-13T14:21:00.000Z	ikonia	phalcon	well done
