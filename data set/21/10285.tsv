2005-04-16T09:37:00.000Z	Xeon3D	EvilIdler	Celeron can be a Cache-reduced p4, p3 or p2 depending on the speed
2005-04-16T09:37:00.000Z	Xeon3D	EvilIdler	this box is a Celeron 2Ghz... a cache-reduced p4
2005-04-16T09:37:00.000Z	EvilIdler	Xeon3D	Then a 300MHz sounds likely to be a P2?
2005-04-16T09:37:00.000Z	Xeon3D	EvilIdler	so it is.
2005-04-16T09:38:00.000Z	EvilIdler	Xeon3D	I keep forgetting what all those old-fashioned 32-bit processors were :)
2005-04-16T09:38:00.000Z	Xeon3D	EvilIdler	nice way of saying you got a 64-bit one.
2005-04-16T09:38:00.000Z	EvilIdler	Xeon3D	Hehe
2005-04-16T09:39:00.000Z	Xeon3D	EvilIdler	 what speed?
2005-04-16T09:40:00.000Z	Xeon3D	EvilIdler	what speed?
2005-04-16T09:41:00.000Z	EvilIdler	Xeon3D	2800+
2005-04-16T09:43:00.000Z	Xeon3D	EvilIdler	care to do a little test?
2005-04-16T09:43:00.000Z	EvilIdler	Xeon3D	What sort of test?
2005-04-16T09:43:00.000Z	Xeon3D	EvilIdler	 pi calculating speed test
2005-04-16T09:43:00.000Z	EvilIdler	Xeon3D	I have a cooling problem here - can't stress the box due to a shitty fan ;)
2005-04-16T09:44:00.000Z	EvilIdler	Xeon3D	I can try
2005-04-16T09:44:00.000Z	EvilIdler	Xeon3D	Mine does. I had to yank some screws out of the walls to fit the fan..when it goes wrong, it's up to 100 degrees.
2005-04-16T09:45:00.000Z	EvilIdler	Xeon3D	It was healthy at first - about 30-40 degrees
2005-04-16T09:45:00.000Z	Xeon3D	EvilIdler	100 DEGREES!?!? THAT would toast IT!
2005-04-16T09:45:00.000Z	EvilIdler	Xeon3D	I know. It could of course be a sensor issue, but it feels *very* hot.
2005-04-16T09:46:00.000Z	EvilIdler	Xeon3D	I'm buying a new fan meant for this mobo when I have money again
2005-04-16T09:46:00.000Z	EvilIdler	Xeon3D	I have Thermaltake at the moment, which included screws that wouldn't fit on any motherboard I've seen :/
