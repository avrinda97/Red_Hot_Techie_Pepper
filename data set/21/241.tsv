2012-06-16T21:42:00.000Z	HelloWorld321		tx dlentz: I'm going to purge that now ...
2012-06-16T21:43:00.000Z	HelloWorld321		how do I get a list out of sudo?  I want to make sure that video is the only nVidia driver I have.
2012-06-16T21:43:00.000Z	HelloWorld321		(I think I might also have nVidia drivers for other parts of the bios)

2012-06-16T21:45:00.000Z	LittleBallOfHate	HelloWorld321	make sure you don't have neuveau and nvidia loaded
2012-06-16T21:45:00.000Z	LittleBallOfHate	HelloWorld321	er, neuveau will keep nvidia from loading
2012-06-16T21:52:00.000Z	LittleBallOfHate	HelloWorld321	purge all the ones in the second column
2012-06-16T21:53:00.000Z	LittleBallOfHate	HelloWorld321	and you might want to install nvidia-current-updates
2012-06-16T21:54:00.000Z	LittleBallOfHate	HelloWorld321	apt-get --purge remove
2012-06-16T21:57:00.000Z	LittleBallOfHate	HelloWorld321	you install the newest?
2012-06-16T21:58:00.000Z	LittleBallOfHate	HelloWorld321	you can't disable the onboard in the biod and not worry about them fighting?
2012-06-16T21:58:00.000Z	LittleBallOfHate	HelloWorld321	nevermind, thought you had an nvidia card too
2012-06-17T17:22:00.000Z	LittleBallOfHate	HelloWorld321	do you have and xorg.conf?

2012-06-17T17:29:00.000Z	LittleBallOfHate	HelloWorld321	what version of ubuntu?
2012-06-17T17:29:00.000Z	HelloWorld321	LittleBallOfHate	thanks.  Precise Pangolin
2012-06-17T17:30:00.000Z	LittleBallOfHate	HelloWorld321	on the off chance this works "sudo apt-get install mesa-utils"
2012-06-17T17:32:00.000Z	HelloWorld321	LittleBallOfHate	it ran with no errors.
2012-06-17T17:32:00.000Z	LittleBallOfHate	HelloWorld321	restart
2012-06-17T18:39:00.000Z	HelloWorld321	LittleBallOfHate	I ran sudo apt-get install mesa-utils and restarted.  Bootup is still telling me that I need to configure video myself.
