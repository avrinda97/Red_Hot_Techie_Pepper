2006-11-22T10:33:00.000Z	ricola		I'm trying to get a TI1225 CardBus controler to work using pcmciautils
2006-11-22T10:33:00.000Z	ricola		and I need to build a ressource database to do that, but don4t have any clue how to
2006-11-22T10:33:00.000Z	ricola		can anyone help?
2006-11-22T10:34:00.000Z	gpled	ricola	that a calculator?
2006-11-22T10:34:00.000Z	ricola	gpled	uh?
2006-11-22T10:34:00.000Z	gpled	ricola	TI1225
2006-11-22T10:35:00.000Z	ricola	gpled	no, not the calculator :)
2006-11-22T10:35:00.000Z	ricola	gpled	its actually labeled as TI PCI1225
2006-11-22T10:35:00.000Z	gpled	ricola	what is it?  sounds like my old TI994A :)
2006-11-22T10:35:00.000Z	ricola	gpled	just a PCMCIA controler in an old Dell laptop
2006-11-22T10:36:00.000Z	gpled	ricola	hmmm, i have had lots of luck with pcmcia controlers.  it is streange it is not working out of box for you.
2006-11-22T10:37:00.000Z	ricola	gpled	its a fairly old laptop
2006-11-22T10:37:00.000Z	gpled	ricola	one thing you could try is boot from knoppix cd, and see if it works.  if it does, then look to see what mods they are loading
2006-11-22T10:38:00.000Z	gpled	ricola	fells like a mod not loading issue
2006-11-22T10:38:00.000Z	ricola	gpled	its not a module problem, and i cant boot anything anyways, the machine has no cd ;)
2006-11-22T10:38:00.000Z	ricola	gpled	no, everythings loaded, it looks like a sysfs/udev issue of some sort
2006-11-22T10:39:00.000Z	gpled	ricola	what version of ubuntu are you using?
2006-11-22T10:40:00.000Z	ricola	gpled	well, i'm actually not using ubuntu, but Debian etch - still, Ubuntu uses newer kernels, do did switch to pcmciautils instead of deprecated pcmcia-cs, which is why i came ask here too
2006-11-22T10:41:00.000Z	gpled	ricola	they "linux people" have been doing a lot of work in the udev space.  if you can get the news stuff on there, it might start working
2006-11-22T10:44:00.000Z	gpled	ricola	here is an idea what they have been doing to udev: http://www.enterprisenetworkingplanet.com/nethub/article.php/3635686
