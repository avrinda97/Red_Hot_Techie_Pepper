2012-09-30T16:05:00.000Z	drsa2		i only use linux
2012-09-30T16:06:00.000Z	drsa2		no
2012-09-30T16:06:00.000Z	drsa2		i need partitions in it
2012-09-30T16:06:00.000Z	drsa2		because i lost all my data 10gb of books while updating from10.4 to 10.10
2012-09-30T16:06:00.000Z	drsa2		so i would like to have a safe update too
2012-09-30T16:07:00.000Z	drsa2		i i know but is it possible to partition and install
2012-09-30T16:08:00.000Z	drsa2		ya now i got a new disk, old one got some bad sectors
2012-09-30T16:09:00.000Z	drsa2		so can you tel how to do partition
2012-09-30T16:09:00.000Z	drsa2		before it was easy when using entr disc
2012-09-30T16:09:00.000Z	drsa2		but now i like to give separate /home and other s
2012-09-30T16:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	drsa2	 the installer can resize. or use a gparted cd.   you will adnt to manually partition as needed to make a seperate /home/
2012-09-30T16:11:00.000Z	dr_willis	drsa2	 this is to be a linux only box? how big a hard disk?
2012-09-30T16:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	drsa2	 id partion similer to this,  15gb for /, a few gb for swap, rest for /home
2012-09-30T16:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	drsa2	 you can have 4 primaries. so you could do them all primary
2012-09-30T16:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	drsa2	 either way wont matter much
2012-09-30T16:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	drsa2	  linux is not real picky about it. if i use  4 or less partitions  i tend to make them all primary
2012-09-30T16:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	drsa2	 ext4 is the default normally
2012-09-30T16:23:00.000Z	dr_willis	drsa2	 /boot/ is optional i rarely use it these days
2012-09-30T16:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	drsa2	 will what make any problems?
2012-09-30T16:30:00.000Z	dr_willis	drsa2	 you can have 4 primary MAX, if you want a logical then that will need to be in an extended.. which will take away one of the primaries
2012-09-30T16:33:00.000Z	dr_willis	drsa2	 easier to delete/remake
