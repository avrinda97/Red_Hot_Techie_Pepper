2007-05-12T13:05:00.000Z	Shafto		Anyone know if to activate a wireless chipset (supported out of the box appearently) requires me to edit /etc/network/interface?
2007-05-12T13:05:00.000Z	cables	Shafto	it shouldn't...
2007-05-12T13:06:00.000Z	Shafto	cables	Well according to the wiki it works out the box it is an Intel 2915ABG, yet it doesnt show up in networking
2007-05-12T13:06:00.000Z	cables	Shafto	that's strange.
2007-05-12T13:06:00.000Z	Shafto	cables	Its detected under hardware too
2007-05-12T13:06:00.000Z	Shafto		;/
2007-05-12T13:08:00.000Z	Shafto	cables	Think i should still take a look at /etc/network/interfaces?
2007-05-12T13:08:00.000Z	cables	Shafto	sure. I don't know what to put in there, though.
2007-05-12T13:09:00.000Z	Shafto	cables	Im just thinking
2007-05-12T13:11:00.000Z	Shafto	cables	Could it be anything to do with having a 108mbps wireless router? Saying that the chip only supports 54mbps?
2007-05-12T13:11:00.000Z	cables	Shafto	you said it doesn't detect the card, right? It should detect it no matter what type of router you're using.
2007-05-12T13:12:00.000Z	Shafto	cables	It shows up in hardware and everything, but not inside the networking in the mnu

2007-05-12T13:12:00.000Z	cables	Shafto	does Network Manager work?
2007-05-12T13:12:00.000Z	Shafto	cables	As in system-->preferences-->network?
2007-05-12T13:13:00.000Z	cables	Shafto	no. Are you using Feisty?
2007-05-12T13:13:00.000Z	Shafto	cables	or admin whichever netork is uner
2007-05-12T13:13:00.000Z	Shafto	cables	Yeah, on windows atm though
2007-05-12T13:14:00.000Z	cables	Shafto	Network Manager is the thing in the Notification Area that manages the network. However, if it doesn't show up in System>Administration>Networking, it probably won't work with Network Manager
2007-05-12T13:14:00.000Z	cables		!ops
2007-05-12T13:14:00.000Z	Shafto	cables	Been in there, nothing there about it
