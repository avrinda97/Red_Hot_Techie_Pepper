2008-11-22T00:37:00.000Z	laku		Hey all, I'm gonna upgrade my gfx card 8600GT -> 9800GT do I need to remove my nvidia-drivers first, and then reinstall then again, once I've changed the card?
2008-11-22T00:37:00.000Z	histo	laku	what drivers are you using now?
2008-11-22T00:38:00.000Z	laku	histo	how do I find that out lol? /proc/?
2008-11-22T00:38:00.000Z	histo	laku	well System > Administration > Hardware Drivers
2008-11-22T00:38:00.000Z	laku	histo	oh, it says NVIDIA accelerated graphic driver (latest cards)
2008-11-22T00:39:00.000Z	histo	laku	Does it have a version number ex: 177
2008-11-22T00:39:00.000Z	laku	histo	no ..
2008-11-22T00:39:00.000Z	histo	laku	are you running intrepid?
2008-11-22T00:39:00.000Z	histo	laku	you should be fine. Assuming its using atleast 177
2008-11-22T00:40:00.000Z	histo	laku	no its not
2008-11-22T00:40:00.000Z	histo	laku	its using 169.
2008-11-22T00:40:00.000Z	histo	laku	you need to either use envyng or install the drivers from nvidia.
2008-11-22T00:41:00.000Z	histo	laku	let me doulbe check that though
2008-11-22T00:41:00.000Z	laku	histo	oh, ok, so I'll have to remove the drivers and then reinstall them once I've changed the card?
2008-11-22T00:41:00.000Z	laku	histo	ok...
2008-11-22T00:44:00.000Z	histo	laku	it would work if you just put the card in and booted; however, you should install the newer driver from nvidia.com either from their site or with envyng
2008-11-22T00:45:00.000Z	histo	laku	There are some performance issues with the nvidia-glx-new package and your card in hardy. Because its newer hardware they added more support in newer drivers that are on nvidia's site and in the intrepid repos.
2008-11-22T00:55:00.000Z	laku	histo	Thanks. So I should use the envyng instead of nvidias official drivers?
2008-11-22T00:55:00.000Z	histo	laku	they both accomplish the same thing.
2008-11-22T00:55:00.000Z	laku	histo	ok, thanks. I'll change the card now.
2008-11-22T00:56:00.000Z	histo	laku	from what I understand envyng takes care of some things for you making it easier. But I think either way is easier.  You should be able to change the card and install the drivers later if you have issues.
