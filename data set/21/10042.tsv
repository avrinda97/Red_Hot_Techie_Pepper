2005-11-19T15:51:00.000Z	nalioth	fatehaze	did you create a / and a "new world bootstrap" or did you just create some free space and let the installer do it?
2005-11-19T15:52:00.000Z	nalioth	fatehaze	i'm thinking it's a bad burn of the cd. burn it again on the slowest speed (and dont use Disk Utility)
