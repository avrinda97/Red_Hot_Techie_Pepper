2008-05-21T04:34:00.000Z	Fritzel		m0use SebNaitsabes, and the fan overclocking utilities for the gpu
2008-05-21T04:34:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Fritzel	 your saying those suck to?  I don't know about those
2008-05-21T04:35:00.000Z	Fritzel	SebNaitsabes	well I can't find one, so in that it sucks
2008-05-21T04:35:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Fritzel	 gpu is to do with opengl?
2008-05-21T04:36:00.000Z	Fritzel	SebNaitsabes	more the other way around, but yes you're on the right track, the gpu is the hardware that processes the instructions opengl gives it, (that's a users rendition of what actually happens and 90% guesswork)
2008-05-21T04:36:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Fritzel	well I got an opengl problem
2008-05-21T04:37:00.000Z	Fritzel	SebNaitsabes	what type of graphics card and does "glxinfo |grep direct" give you "Yes"
2008-05-21T04:37:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Fritzel	 the graphics card not sure, some Nividia one though I guess
2008-05-21T04:37:00.000Z	Fritzel	SebNaitsabes	know thine hardware

2008-05-21T04:39:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Fritzel	how to find out my graphics card?  and it seems to be an open GL problem.  I installed a program earlier Zattoo Player and it won't open from the menu, so I put it on desktop right clicked and got the opening command and in the terminal I get:   http://pastebin.com/m76c744f8
2008-05-21T04:40:00.000Z	Fritzel	SebNaitsabes	if you open a console "glxinfo |grep direct" without the quotes what do you get?
2008-05-21T04:41:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Fritzel	 this  http://pastebin.com/m50b7d5d0
2008-05-21T04:43:00.000Z	Fritzel	SebNaitsabes	ok first thing you need to do is find out what brand of video card you have Nvidia or ATI (and that's not something I know how to check) next thing you should do is install envyng and install the correct video card driver after that you should be able to progress past where you are now
2008-05-21T04:43:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Fritzel	 well I guess it 's Nividia since I installed the propritary driver
2008-05-21T04:45:00.000Z	Fritzel	SebNaitsabes	well then I suppose you can try to install envyng and the video driver through that

2008-05-21T04:49:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Fritzel	sometimes or quite often for more advanced things,  the  Kubuntu channel is better, just a thought, and since Ubuntu and Kubuntu are similar well then
