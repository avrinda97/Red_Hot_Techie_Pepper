2008-10-05T12:45:00.000Z	outbackwifi	scuser	you need to install libsasl2-modules-ldap
2008-10-05T12:46:00.000Z	scuser	outbackwifi	I've installed it but still have the same error message
2008-10-05T12:47:00.000Z	outbackwifi	scuser	can you do a ldd on the ldap binary?
2008-10-05T12:49:00.000Z	scuser	outbackwifi	yes I did ldd ./ldapsearch, so ?
2008-10-05T12:50:00.000Z	outbackwifi	scuser	pastebin tthe output of that
2008-10-05T12:50:00.000Z	scuser	outbackwifi	http://paste.ubuntu.com/54163/, that's it
2008-10-05T12:51:00.000Z	outbackwifi	scuser	that says sasl support is available --> libsasl2.so.2 => /usr/lib/libsasl2.so.2 (0x00002af9f9d12000)
2008-10-05T12:51:00.000Z	outbackwifi	scuser	what was the error you got when you ran ldapsearch?
2008-10-05T12:52:00.000Z	scuser	outbackwifi	so when I type "ldapsearch -b "dc=sc,dc=bibalex,dc=org" -Y GSSAPI" I got the error message "ldapsearch: not compiled with SASL support"
2008-10-05T12:55:00.000Z	outbackwifi	scuser	have you got the libsasl2-modules-gssapi-mit and libsasl2-modules-gssapi-heimdal
2008-10-05T12:56:00.000Z	scuser	outbackwifi	no, only libsasl2-modules-gssapi-mit, should I install libsasl2-modules-gssapi-heimdal ?
2008-10-05T12:57:00.000Z	outbackwifi	scuser	you could try that too
2008-10-05T12:58:00.000Z	scuser	outbackwifi	should I restart the slapd server or reboot the machine after installation ?
2008-10-05T12:58:00.000Z	outbackwifi	scuser	restart the slapd server
2008-10-05T12:59:00.000Z	outbackwifi	scuser	though that doesnt make sense since  you are trying to run ldapsearch
2008-10-05T12:59:00.000Z	scuser	outbackwifi	the same error, :(
2008-10-05T13:01:00.000Z	scuser	outbackwifi	any suggestions ?
2008-10-05T13:02:00.000Z	outbackwifi	scuser	sorry no
2008-10-05T13:03:00.000Z	scuser	outbackwifi	thank you for your time
2008-10-05T13:03:00.000Z	outbackwifi	scuser	only other option is to download latest stable source and build it with sasl support
2008-10-05T14:22:00.000Z	scuser	outbackwifi	Hi, I have this error now "ldap_sasl_interactive_bind_s: Local error (-2)" I'm trying to run the command " ldapsearch -b "dc=sc,dc=bibalex,dc=org" -Y "GSSAPI" -U scuser". Any idea?
