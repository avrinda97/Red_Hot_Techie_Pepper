2006-12-06T14:33:00.000Z	Hexxoo		So.. running Ubuntu on amd64 is just an absolutely moot point or? :S
2006-12-06T14:34:00.000Z	Hexxoo		anything that wasn't installed along with the fresh install of Ubuntu
2006-12-06T14:34:00.000Z	Hexxoo		Except for Thunderbird mail client
2006-12-06T14:35:00.000Z	Hexxoo		AbiWord word Processor, Amarok, Gnumeric Spreadsheet, gFTP
2006-12-06T14:35:00.000Z	Hexxoo		to name a few
2006-12-06T14:36:00.000Z	Hexxoo		I tried to install kvirc(sp?) and got that error message
2006-12-06T14:37:00.000Z	Hexxoo		and then when I looked more closely, almost everything else gave me that too :/
2006-12-06T14:37:00.000Z	Hexxoo		now it just gives me that error as soon as I click the checkbox
2006-12-06T14:37:00.000Z	Hexxoo		for any application
2006-12-06T14:38:00.000Z	Hexxoo		can't even remove any packages
2006-12-06T14:38:00.000Z	soundray	Hexxoo	can you repeat that error message for me (late comer)
2006-12-06T14:39:00.000Z	soundray	Hexxoo	what package manager are you using?
2006-12-06T14:40:00.000Z	soundray	Hexxoo	could you put your /etc/apt/sources.list on the pastebin please
2006-12-06T14:43:00.000Z	soundray	Hexxoo	what do you get when you type in a terminal 'sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get install gnumeric'
2006-12-06T14:45:00.000Z	soundray	Hexxoo	is that with the command I gave you?
2006-12-06T14:46:00.000Z	soundray	Hexxoo	give me a minute...
2006-12-06T14:51:00.000Z	soundray	Hexxoo	I suggest you try to connect to the de. mirror instead of is. Do 'sudo sed 's/is\./de\./g' /etc/apt/sources.list'
2006-12-06T14:52:00.000Z	soundray	Hexxoo	everything inside the outer quotes -- then the previous command again.
2006-12-06T14:54:00.000Z	soundray	Hexxoo	the sed command hasn't worked then... hold on...
2006-12-06T14:56:00.000Z	soundray	Hexxoo	installations work, too?
2006-12-06T14:58:00.000Z	soundray	Hexxoo	something must be wrong in Iceland, then ;)
