2006-07-08T12:12:00.000Z	Spliffster	bobby	ususally: $ cd /where/the/source/is; ./configure && make && sudo make install .... or better look if there is a README or INSTALL file
2006-07-08T12:13:00.000Z	Spliffster	bobby	ok ... so you need the programs like make, gcc, autoconf and the such ?
2006-07-08T12:13:00.000Z	Spliffster	bobby	check $ man gcc and also $ man make
2006-07-08T12:14:00.000Z	Spliffster	bobby	and make sure you have build-essentials installed first
2006-07-08T12:15:00.000Z	Spliffster	bobby	you need the cc or gcc program to compile a c source file
2006-07-08T12:15:00.000Z	Spliffster	bobby	check the corresponding man page
2006-07-08T12:16:00.000Z	Spliffster	bobby	and you might like to use the -WALL option too
2006-07-08T12:16:00.000Z	Spliffster	bobby	a space between gcc and "-o"
2006-07-08T12:16:00.000Z	Spliffster	bobby	 and it should wok
2006-07-08T12:18:00.000Z	Spliffster	bobby	is the file to compile in the cureent directory ? give gcc the full path to your file ... next you'll need to setup your build environment
2006-07-08T12:20:00.000Z	Spliffster	bobby	ok ... gcc found the file ... now you need to do your homework and cleanup your code so it won't throw errors .... you might ask further questions and a C or gcc related room
2006-07-08T12:20:00.000Z	Spliffster	bobby	yes ... just a guess however
