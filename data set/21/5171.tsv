2010-12-18T19:15:00.000Z	soreau	drew_	For what card model?
2010-12-18T19:16:00.000Z	drew_	soreau	ATI 9200
2010-12-18T19:16:00.000Z	soreau	drew_	fglrx has not supported that card for years now. You need to remove it
2010-12-18T19:17:00.000Z	drew_	soreau	what card would you recommend for dual monitors?
2010-12-18T19:17:00.000Z	soreau	drew_	A card with more than one output?
2010-12-18T19:18:00.000Z	drew_	soreau	yes
2010-12-18T19:18:00.000Z	soreau	drew_	A card with more than one output.
2010-12-18T19:18:00.000Z	drew_	soreau	when you said remove it, the driver or the card?
2010-12-18T19:19:00.000Z	soreau	drew_	fglrx/proprietary ati/catalyst driver
2010-12-18T19:19:00.000Z	soreau	drew_	The driver that you want is radeon and it is already installed and working by default. Installing fglrx will only break it
2010-12-18T19:21:00.000Z	drew_	soreau	the problem is that the acer monitor is shows the mirror of the nec monitor, but it is not in mirror mode.
2010-12-18T19:21:00.000Z	soreau	drew_	After you get rid of fglrx and restore radeon, pastebin the output of xrandr
2010-12-18T19:22:00.000Z	drew_	soreau	is there a detailed page that shows how to do that?
2010-12-18T19:23:00.000Z	soreau	drew_	Do what?
2010-12-18T19:24:00.000Z	drew_	soreau	removing fglrx, restoring radeon and pastbin?
2010-12-18T19:24:00.000Z	soreau	drew_	It depends on how many different ways you installed it
2010-12-18T19:31:00.000Z	soreau	drew_	I have to go but after you finish removing fglrx (uninstall fglrx packages and look for an uninstall script in /usr/share/ati if you used a .run file to install it) then reinstall libgl1-mesa-glx and -dri, remove /etc/X11/xorg.conf and then something like xrandr --output VGA-0 --mode 1024x768 --output LVDS --mode 1024x768 --right-of VGA-0
2010-12-18T19:31:00.000Z	drew_	soreau	ty for the help
2010-12-18T19:36:00.000Z	drew_	soreau	 here's the pastbin  http://paste.ubuntu.com/545283/
2010-12-18T19:36:00.000Z	soreau	drew_	Try xrandr --output VGA-0 --right-of DVI-0
