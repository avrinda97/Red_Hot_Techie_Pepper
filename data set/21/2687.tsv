2009-07-26T16:25:00.000Z	D4VE		I want to make cowpatty run just by typing cowpatty anywhere
2009-07-26T16:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	D4VE	add the path of the executable to PATH or symlink your executable somewere in your current path
2009-07-26T16:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	D4VE	sudo ln -s /path/to/the/executable /usr/local/bin/executable
2009-07-26T16:28:00.000Z	D4VE	erUSUL	this one right thebn?
2009-07-26T16:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	D4VE	?

2009-07-26T16:34:00.000Z	D4VE	erUSUL	Hey id didn't work, cowpatty will only run from its directory like so: ./cowpatty
2009-07-26T16:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	D4VE	can you post the exact command you used ?
2009-07-26T16:34:00.000Z	D4VE	erUSUL	sudo ln -s /Home/cowpatty-4.3/cowpatty /usr/local/bin/cowpatty
2009-07-26T16:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	D4VE	capital H ? or you made a typo here ? it is in /home/ or in /home/youruser/... ?
2009-07-26T16:38:00.000Z	D4VE	erUSUL	HEy I got this after modifying the command: ln: creating symbolic link `/usr/local/bin/cowpatty': File exists
2009-07-26T16:39:00.000Z	erUSUL	D4VE	remove it first « sudo rm /usr/local/bin/cowpatty »
2009-07-26T16:39:00.000Z	D4VE	erUSUL	thanks
2009-07-26T16:40:00.000Z	D4VE	erUSUL	Hey thanks man it's worked. what is this process called so i can look more into it?
2009-07-26T16:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	D4VE	what process? symlinking ? or the fact that linux only run executables present in your PATH variable ?
2009-07-26T16:42:00.000Z	D4VE	erUSUL	making things exacutable without having to use the dir path or ./
2009-07-26T16:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	D4VE	then search about the PATH variable
2009-07-26T16:44:00.000Z	D4VE	erUSUL	 thanks mate keep on trucking
