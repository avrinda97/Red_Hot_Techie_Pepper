2012-02-05T04:54:00.000Z	nivyaj	veryhappy	this is what they have in the directions..... PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/lib/idea-7364/bin"
2012-02-05T04:56:00.000Z	veryhappy	nivyaj	the colons will be used for dividing other paths, just append your path behind the last colons like : /home/nivyaj/bin/idea-IC-111.277 - without a slash behind the last directory
