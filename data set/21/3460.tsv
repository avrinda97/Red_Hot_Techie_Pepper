2009-02-19T09:55:00.000Z	VieQ		even lately I had a Friend how could not install many thing until he upgraded to normal release
2009-02-19T09:56:00.000Z	VieQ		Nobe
2009-02-19T09:58:00.000Z	VieQ		But is n't ubuntu repo's compatible with Debian?
2009-02-19T09:59:00.000Z	VieQ		hmm, Compared to debian which is most up2date
2009-02-19T10:01:00.000Z	VieQ		I have no problems with doing updates every night if I had to, but this is kinda the system is leading me not I am leading the system
2009-02-19T10:01:00.000Z	VieQ		I do not know how to explain it more
2009-02-19T10:03:00.000Z	VieQ		no no, I do not have any debian repo's
2009-02-19T10:03:00.000Z	VieQ		I was just "if it's recommended" gonna make a switch
2009-02-19T10:04:00.000Z	VieQ		I was gonna install debian with ubuntu repo's
2009-02-19T10:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	VieQ	that's not a good idea, if it's even possible
2009-02-19T10:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	VieQ	if you want Debian get real Debian or something such as Sidux
2009-02-19T10:05:00.000Z	VieQ	sebsebseb	that's what I ment
2009-02-19T10:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	VieQ	 so you  want a real Debian distro?
2009-02-19T10:06:00.000Z	VieQ	sebsebseb	yes..
2009-02-19T10:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	VieQ	Google Sidux,  I still haven't tried that in a virtual machine, but  a  guy who helped me out with Ubuntu when I was a lot more newbie,  uses Sidux
2009-02-19T10:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	VieQ	Sidux then you get the latest Debian stuff, but in a stable OS
2009-02-19T10:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	VieQ	uh something just now made me sound like Ubuntu newbie ha ha,  I been with Ubuntu since second release, and used Fedora Core 2 and 4 before this
2009-02-19T10:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	VieQ	as well as Knoppix and such on Live CD
2009-02-19T10:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	VieQ	ok well then try Sidux out for sure
2009-02-19T10:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	VieQ	yeah something like that, but it's meant to be pretty good
2009-02-19T10:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	VieQ	well  I guess you could try, but something odd would happen I expect, if you added proper Debian repos
