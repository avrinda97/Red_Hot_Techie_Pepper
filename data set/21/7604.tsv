2008-02-23T04:42:00.000Z	Huffalump		What is the command to edit when you are inside a subshell.... inside a shell... during install?  nano doesnt work, edit doesnt work, vi is a nightmare.  Help?
2008-02-23T04:43:00.000Z	macogw	Huffalump	vi should work since thats the unix default
2008-02-23T04:43:00.000Z	macogw	Huffalump	why's it a nightmare?
2008-02-23T04:43:00.000Z	Huffalump	macogw	I'll give it another go
2008-02-23T04:44:00.000Z	Huffalump	macogw	the screen shifts all over and I cannot keep track of wher the cursor is
2008-02-23T04:44:00.000Z	macogw	Huffalump	cursor??
2008-02-23T04:44:00.000Z	Huffalump	macogw	prompt?  I'm not sure the terminology
2008-02-23T04:45:00.000Z	macogw	Huffalump	er...you hit j to move down, k to move up, h for left, and l for right
2008-02-23T04:45:00.000Z	macogw	Huffalump	i to insert
2008-02-23T04:45:00.000Z	macogw	Huffalump	Esc to exit insert mode and return to command mode
2008-02-23T04:45:00.000Z	Huffalump	macogw	I get Error 388: Couldn't find definition.  I just can't seem to get around in vi to edit my /etc/fstab
2008-02-23T04:46:00.000Z	macogw	Huffalump	i dont know what you mean.... you cant type "vi /etc/fstab"?
2008-02-23T04:46:00.000Z	Huffalump	macogw	insert allows me to edit a file?  I will try it
2008-02-23T04:46:00.000Z	macogw	Huffalump	insert is how you start the typing bit...it's in command mode by default
2008-02-23T04:46:00.000Z	Huffalump	macogw	I have the file open in vi.  I am trying to edit so it will mount the floppy
2008-02-23T04:46:00.000Z	Huffalump	macogw	thank you
2008-02-23T04:47:00.000Z	macogw	Huffalump	hit G to jump to the last line, if that helps
2008-02-23T04:47:00.000Z	Huffalump	macogw	I think I am starting to get it. How do I make a line return?
2008-02-23T04:48:00.000Z	Huffalump	macogw	I see... I go into insert mode and use line return and then get out of insert
2008-02-23T04:52:00.000Z	macogw	Huffalump	to save, hit ZZ or type :wq
2008-02-23T04:52:00.000Z	macogw	Huffalump	w=write q=quit
