2010-10-30T23:52:00.000Z	progre55		hi people! has anyone tried installing ubuntu on a macbook? is it even possible? )
2010-10-30T23:52:00.000Z	yagoo	progre55	if it's intel.. many people have..
2010-10-30T23:53:00.000Z	yagoo	progre55	you'll need to look into the refti project
2010-10-30T23:53:00.000Z	progre55	yagoo	umm.. is macbook air intel? =) I dont have one yet, but thinking to buy..

2010-10-30T23:54:00.000Z	progre55	yagoo	thanks, I'll have a look at it
2010-10-30T23:55:00.000Z	yagoo	progre55	I would personally use the installer dvd to shrink (if possible) the hfs+ partition..
2010-10-30T23:55:00.000Z	yagoo	progre55	or u can use possibly some other tips to shrink the hfs+ partition... but am not too sure how efficient bootcamp would be..
2010-10-30T23:56:00.000Z	progre55	yagoo	okay, thanks. but how about the compatibility? the keys, etc. do they all work?
2010-10-30T23:56:00.000Z	progre55	yagoo	say, if I install and boot it from an external hard, would it work?
2010-10-30T23:57:00.000Z	yagoo	progre55	you probably don't need refit to boot from usb.. I'm just guessing-- you'd best ask #refit
2010-10-30T23:58:00.000Z	progre55	yagoo	cool, thanks man, appreciate
2010-10-30T23:59:00.000Z	yagoo	progre55	http://refit.sourceforge.net/help/usb_disk.html -- your firmware may support usb boot.. btw you may wish to see if there's an apple update for your efifirmware...
2010-10-31T00:00:00.000Z	progre55	yagoo	I havent got a macbook yet, next week
2010-10-31T00:00:00.000Z	progre55	yagoo	I really want the mac design, but not a fan of osx)
2010-10-31T00:01:00.000Z	yagoo	progre55	you should keep an install of osx, just for those simple firmware updates..
2010-10-31T00:01:00.000Z	progre55	yagoo	sure thing =)
2010-10-31T00:01:00.000Z	yagoo	progre55	you'd probably be able to shrink the hfs+ partition to about 7-8 gigs..
2010-10-31T00:02:00.000Z	yagoo	progre55	if u never intend to use osx... there's no point in buying a macbook
