2006-04-18T09:47:00.000Z	oneko	bImInTroule	did you update the kernel?
2006-04-18T09:47:00.000Z	bImInTroule	oneko	a good while ago
2006-04-18T09:48:00.000Z	bImInTroule	oneko	no it wasn't actually
2006-04-18T09:49:00.000Z	bImInTroule	oneko	you think i can salvage this? or am i gonna have to reinstall ?
2006-04-18T09:58:00.000Z	oneko	bImInTroule	you can 'sudo sh' then 'passwd' to set a root pass
2006-04-18T09:59:00.000Z	bImInTroule	oneko	diskless machine?
2006-04-18T09:59:00.000Z	oneko	bImInTroule	yeah, it loads the kernel, OS, root disk, etc over the network
2006-04-18T09:59:00.000Z	oneko	bImInTroule	it doesnt have any local drives at all
2006-04-18T10:00:00.000Z	bImInTroule	oneko	oh, ok
2006-04-18T10:02:00.000Z	oneko	bImInTroule	if i was there, at your machine, i'd fix it ;)
2006-04-18T10:02:00.000Z	oneko	bImInTroule	but it might be easier just to reinstall
2006-04-18T10:03:00.000Z	oneko	bImInTroule	what I do on a hosed system is mv /etc to /etc-old, and rm everything except /home
2006-04-18T10:03:00.000Z	oneko	bImInTroule	then reinstall without formatting
