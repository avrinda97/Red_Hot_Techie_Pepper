2011-06-30T11:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	avinashhm	you set permissions and ownership at mount with ntfs and fat based partitions. They are too primitive to store Linux file attributes
2011-06-30T11:36:00.000Z	avinashhm	ActionParsnip	how can i change it during mount ... its a HDD and as i plug, it gets detected and mounted
2011-06-30T11:36:00.000Z	avinashhm	ActionParsnip	Is it defined during create time ?
2011-06-30T11:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	avinashhm	you can add udev rules or an entry in /etc/fstab to define the mount options, or you can manually mount it
2011-06-30T11:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	avinashhm	why are you trying to make a folder executable anyway?
2011-06-30T11:44:00.000Z	avinashhm	ActionParsnip	sorry .. not trying to make it executable, but writable.. i want to make it writable .. i think just to show i executed wrong
2011-06-30T11:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	avinashhm	last time you removed the stick from a system, what steps did you take
2011-06-30T11:45:00.000Z	avinashhm	ActionParsnip	i just umount /media/win and then plugged it out
2011-06-30T11:46:00.000Z	avinashhm	ActionParsnip	we change the permission using ownmask , othmask right ?
2011-06-30T11:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	avinashhm	you need to eject it too. The desktop and nautilus entries for the partition have this in the right click menu
2011-06-30T11:47:00.000Z	avinashhm	ActionParsnip	i though , doing umount from CLI, does eject ? is it wrong ?
2011-06-30T11:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	avinashhm	does the device have an activity light
2011-06-30T11:50:00.000Z	avinashhm	ActionParsnip	'sudo mount -t auto /dev/sdb1 /media/win.pc/' .. how to change this one to include permissions ? ..yes device has a activity light, which turns off after i do the umount ..
2011-06-30T11:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	avinashhm	add:   -o rw,user,uid=1000     should help
2011-06-30T11:53:00.000Z	avinashhm	ActionParsnip	thanks man .. it really helped ... i appreciate your responses .. thanks very much
2011-06-30T11:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	avinashhm	i'd make a note of the options, so you can use it later, or add it in /etc/fstab
2011-06-30T11:55:00.000Z	avinashhm	ActionParsnip	i ll make a note of this definitely .. thanks
2011-06-30T11:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	avinashhm	np :-)
2011-06-30T11:57:00.000Z	avinashhm	ActionParsnip	i was looking to add this to fstab ...
2011-06-30T11:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	avinashhm	take out the o= and it should be ok. I suggest you run: sudo blkid   and use the UUID of the partition.
2011-06-30T12:01:00.000Z	avinashhm	ActionParsnip	sure man .. i ll add the UUID .. thanks buddy
