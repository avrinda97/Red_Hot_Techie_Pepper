2008-04-25T11:28:00.000Z	Acoustyk		anyone know how to stop lag in firefox 3 on hardy?
2008-04-25T11:29:00.000Z	Acoustyk		the scrolling is awfully jagged
2008-04-25T11:29:00.000Z	ricree	Acoustyk	what is the cpu usage like?
2008-04-25T11:30:00.000Z	ricree	Acoustyk	 System>Administration>System Monitor
2008-04-25T11:30:00.000Z	ricree	Acoustyk	Also, the top comand line utility will do that
2008-04-25T11:31:00.000Z	Acoustyk	ricree	ext3 has 8.3 gigs free
2008-04-25T11:32:00.000Z	Acoustyk	ricree	cpu usage is at 40%
2008-04-25T11:32:00.000Z	ricree	Acoustyk	mostly firefox?
2008-04-25T11:33:00.000Z	Acoustyk	ricree	no it looks like xgl and gnome-do are more
2008-04-25T11:34:00.000Z	Acoustyk	ricree	it spikes when firefox changes a page
2008-04-25T11:35:00.000Z	ricree	Acoustyk	Does the slowdown depend on how much javascript or flash is being used on the page?
2008-04-25T11:35:00.000Z	ricree	Acoustyk	Also, how much free memory do you have?
2008-04-25T11:36:00.000Z	Acoustyk	ricree	free swap memory? (and yes flash makes it worse but this page is all text and it slows it down still)
2008-04-25T11:36:00.000Z	ricree	Acoustyk	physical memory.  Should be on the left in the System monitor resources tab
2008-04-25T11:37:00.000Z	Acoustyk	ricree	7.1 gigs
2008-04-25T11:37:00.000Z	ricree	Acoustyk	 Are you sure about that?
2008-04-25T11:37:00.000Z	Acoustyk	ricree	thats space on my hard drive
2008-04-25T11:38:00.000Z	ricree	Acoustyk	what about the RAM
2008-04-25T11:39:00.000Z	Acoustyk	ricree	and 0 bytes of swap
2008-04-25T11:41:00.000Z	ricree	Acoustyk	Then I'm not really sure what's up.  You might try seeing if it's a javascript issue, but it sounds like something other than firefox is causing the problem and I'm not sure what
2008-04-25T11:42:00.000Z	ricree	Acoustyk	 Sorry that I couldn't do more
