2009-01-19T19:46:00.000Z	CyL		I've just installed ubuntu 8.10 on my system and is says me I have to install almost 250 mbytes of security updates, is this correct?
2009-01-19T19:47:00.000Z	CyL		fosco_: does ubuntu lists only the updates needed by my system?
2009-01-19T19:47:00.000Z	lyricaldogg	CyL	yes

2009-01-19T19:49:00.000Z	lyricaldogg	CyL	mos of your apt-get will do everything for you, such as autoclean, autoremove and purge
2009-01-19T20:34:00.000Z	CyL	lyricaldogg	ubuntu 8.10
2009-01-19T20:35:00.000Z	lyricaldogg	CyL	press Alt Gr the the @ the the a .. what's the output?
2009-01-19T20:36:00.000Z	CyL	lyricaldogg	not exactly, to get an á I would like to type an acute, then an "a", and only then get the á displayed
2009-01-19T20:39:00.000Z	lyricaldogg	CyL	what i do myself because i write in Portuguese is, get them from the combination that i gave you like Alt Gr + : the e= é then you can get all the others around it with the same combination from the other keys around it äãáâà
