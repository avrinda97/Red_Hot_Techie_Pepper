2007-05-15T16:26:00.000Z	jrib	rokra	what does the script do?  Would replacing a fileexec witha  symlink to /bin/true (in order to troubleshoot) cause problems?
2007-05-15T16:27:00.000Z	rokra	jrib	how to do that?
2007-05-15T16:28:00.000Z	rokra	jrib	from what country are you?
2007-05-15T16:29:00.000Z	jrib	rokra	make a backup of fileexec and then ln -s /bin/true /usr/bin/fileexec
2007-05-15T16:30:00.000Z	rokra	jrib	to `/bin/true': File exists
2007-05-15T16:30:00.000Z	jrib	rokra	make a backup of fileexec and then ln -s /bin/true /usr/bin/fileexec
2007-05-15T16:30:00.000Z	jrib	rokra	delete fileexec after you make the backup

2007-05-15T16:33:00.000Z	jrib	rokra	aren't you supposed to launch the original script taht gave you an error regarding /usr/bin/fileexec?
2007-05-15T16:35:00.000Z	rokra	jrib	mmh?? I did ln -s /bin/true /usr/bin/file  so file  = true
2007-05-15T16:35:00.000Z	jrib	rokra	why did you do "file"?  you were supposed to do "fileexec", the random script you refuse to give me information about
