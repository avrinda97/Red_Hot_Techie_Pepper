2009-05-31T18:01:00.000Z	xray7224		ooo lets see what it says about the realise i started with
2009-05-31T18:01:00.000Z	xray7224		!7.10
2009-05-31T18:01:00.000Z	xray7224		:( aww damn its got no support
2009-05-31T18:02:00.000Z	craigbass1976	xray7224	you are joking right?
2009-05-31T18:02:00.000Z	xray7224	craigbass1976	nope
2009-05-31T18:03:00.000Z	craigbass1976	xray7224	I only breezed through it on the upgrade path from edgy to hardy, but I heard all sorts of people complaining about it
2009-05-31T18:03:00.000Z	xray7224	craigbass1976	i loved it :D
2009-05-31T18:08:00.000Z	xray7224	craigbass1976	you want to list all networks around you ?
2009-05-31T18:09:00.000Z	xray7224	craigbass1976	try "iwlist scan"
2009-05-31T18:10:00.000Z	xray7224	craigbass1976	just do "iwlist scan"
2009-05-31T18:10:00.000Z	xray7224	craigbass1976	do "ifconfig ath0 up"
2009-05-31T18:10:00.000Z	craigbass1976	xray7224	right, but lo and eth0 don't support scanning
2009-05-31T18:11:00.000Z	xray7224	craigbass1976	i know that lo = 127.0.0.1 and eth0 is ethernet
2009-05-31T18:11:00.000Z	craigbass1976	xray7224	nope, no such device.  Hang on, I'll google some more
2009-05-31T18:11:00.000Z	xray7224	craigbass1976	sounds like hardy doesnt have your drivers
2009-05-31T18:12:00.000Z	craigbass1976	xray7224	it says it did, and is using them
2009-05-31T18:12:00.000Z	xray7224	craigbass1976	ether complie the latest kernel *.29 or upgrade to a later ubuntu
2009-05-31T18:12:00.000Z	xray7224	craigbass1976	apt might not like you compling your own kernel so you might be best off updating
2009-05-31T18:14:00.000Z	xray7224	craigbass1976	most likely
2009-05-31T18:15:00.000Z	craigbass1976	xray7224	to bad.  I'm guessing he was warned a coupld times first
2009-05-31T18:16:00.000Z	xray7224	craigbass1976	probabaly i run my own irc channel and its hard to deal with peopel who refuse to follow the rules and mines a small channel i cant even imagen what a pain people are in a channel the size of this
