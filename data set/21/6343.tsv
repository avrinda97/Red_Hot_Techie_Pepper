2007-09-16T11:24:00.000Z	usser	Dr_willis	everything that can be done in hardware can also be done in soft and vice versa
2007-09-16T11:24:00.000Z	Dr_willis	usser	 hard to make code that gives me a hard copy. :)
2007-09-16T11:25:00.000Z	usser	Dr_willis	why not hard at all, just burn the program on cd theres your hard copy
2007-09-16T11:25:00.000Z	Dr_willis	usser	 how about Daemontools to emulate the cd. :)
2007-09-16T11:26:00.000Z	usser	Dr_willis	Daemontools=CD drive, as iso=cd-rom

2008-08-12T05:31:00.000Z	usser	Dr_willis	lets u reinstall os with ease though, u know that tiny little modifications u make to all those configs
2008-08-12T05:31:00.000Z	Dr_willis	usser	 i recall ages ago big issues with /etc/ being different from on /  Like how does one mount /etc/ when thers no /etc/fstab for the system to find in the first place...
2008-08-12T05:32:00.000Z	Dr_willis	usser	 i havent tried or needed to move /etc/ somewhere else  in years.. :) so it may no longer be an issue.
2008-08-12T05:34:00.000Z	usser	Dr_willis	hm thats a good question,have a symbolic link in /etc directory[not the one on the partition], i think you can mount into directories with files in them
2008-08-12T05:35:00.000Z	Dr_willis	usser	 Yep. I  recall some people really shooting themeself in the foot by trying to put everything on its own partition. :)
