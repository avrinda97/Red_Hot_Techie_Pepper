2011-03-06T20:42:00.000Z	GraphicH		I have a problem with Twinview and 3 Monitors. All I want to do is run Twin view on 2 of the monitors and the third to have a separate x screen (I only use the third for things I want open all the time) However when I enable twin view it stretches everything across the 2 monitors and maiximizes windows across both of them. However if I unhook the third monitor, it works like expected, with windows maximizing to just the monitor they are on
2011-03-06T20:43:00.000Z	ikonia	GraphicH	is it a dual head or tripple headed card
2011-03-06T20:43:00.000Z	ikonia	GraphicH	twinview won't span multiple cards
2011-03-06T20:44:00.000Z	ikonia	GraphicH	do you still plan to use the propritary nvidia module for the 3rd screen ?
2011-03-06T20:44:00.000Z	GraphicH	ikonia	if not using it will make this set up work than I dont care, I just dont want to use xinerama because it sucks
2011-03-06T20:45:00.000Z	GraphicH	ikonia	I get terrible laggy looks from just dragging windows around
2011-03-06T20:46:00.000Z	ikonia	GraphicH	truthfully, I don't know if it will make it easier, I'm not working through in my head how one module loaded can drive two different modes
2011-03-06T20:47:00.000Z	GraphicH	ikonia	All I know is that twinview operates how I expexct it to when the third monitor is plugged in, as soon as its plugged in, everything gets stretched across both monitors in twin view even though the other has its own xscreen
2011-03-06T20:48:00.000Z	GraphicH	ikonia	third monitor is *not* plugged in I mean
2011-03-06T20:48:00.000Z	ikonia	GraphicH	yup I agree, and I think that's to do with the nvidia module not being able to split two different modes
2011-03-06T20:48:00.000Z	ikonia	GraphicH	I'm just having a read up on it now
2011-03-06T20:49:00.000Z	GraphicH	ikonia	ugh I really wish multimonitor support was better under linux
2011-03-06T20:49:00.000Z	ikonia	GraphicH	it is, just not with propitary devices such as nvidia
2011-03-06T20:50:00.000Z	GraphicH	ikonia	well then I wish nv would open source their damn drivers, how the hell could it hurt them to do that?
2011-03-06T20:50:00.000Z	ikonia	GraphicH	I can't really debate that
2011-03-06T20:51:00.000Z	GraphicH	ikonia	so how could I get 3 monitors to work, not use nv cards?
2011-03-06T20:52:00.000Z	ikonia	GraphicH	I'm sure it's possible with 3 monitors, I wonder if twinview is a portition  of the problem
2011-03-06T20:52:00.000Z	GraphicH	ikonia	the more I read the more Im comming to think it is a twin view problem
2011-03-06T20:53:00.000Z	ikonia	GraphicH	that is my view also
2011-03-06T20:53:00.000Z	GraphicH	ikonia	I thought I had read somewhere once that someone had gotten the set up to work but that it was broken again recently
2011-03-06T20:54:00.000Z	ikonia	GraphicH	I don't know, I'm not %100 current with twinview
