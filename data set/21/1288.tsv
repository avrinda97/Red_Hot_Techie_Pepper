2010-11-13T19:00:00.000Z	cq75		hi, I was installing auto-apt from the console, but it failed somehow, I closed the console and it's still running, how do I stop it (in windows I'd bring up the task manager)
2010-11-13T19:01:00.000Z	LjL	cq75	what is still running, apt?
2010-11-13T19:02:00.000Z	cq75	LjL	- apt-get
2010-11-13T19:02:00.000Z	LjL		!ot | AW23
2010-11-13T19:02:00.000Z	LjL	cq75	it can be dangerous to stop apt-get
2010-11-13T19:02:00.000Z	LjL	cq75	are you sure it's frozen up?
2010-11-13T19:02:00.000Z	cq75		no
2010-11-13T19:03:00.000Z	cq75		it might be running
2010-11-13T19:03:00.000Z	cq75		how do I know if it's running... sorry, I just got this yesterday
2010-11-13T19:03:00.000Z	LjL	cq75	i suggest you wait a little longer. when you're fed up, do what candrea said, and if that still doesn't work, "sudo killall -9 apt-get"
2010-11-13T19:03:00.000Z	LjL	cq75	well try doing "ps aux | grep apt" and look at the CPU percentage
2010-11-13T19:06:00.000Z	cq75		it says it's still trying to install
2010-11-13T19:06:00.000Z	cq75		my apt-get install auto-apt command is there
2010-11-13T19:07:00.000Z	cq75		it's been a few minutes, terminate it?
2010-11-13T19:07:00.000Z	cq75		it seems strange it would freeze...
2010-11-13T19:07:00.000Z	cq75		oh.
2010-11-13T19:07:00.000Z	cq75		I remember why I closed the console
2010-11-13T19:07:00.000Z	cq75		that command eventually brought me to an e-mail setup wizard
2010-11-13T19:08:00.000Z	cq75		which seemed to be in an infinite loop
2010-11-13T19:08:00.000Z	cq75		(why did auto-apt bring me to an e-mail setup?)
2010-11-13T19:11:00.000Z	LjL	cq75	try killing it, at this point, but be prepared to have to fiddle to make apt work properly again :\
