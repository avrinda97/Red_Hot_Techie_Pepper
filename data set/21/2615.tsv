2009-08-18T18:56:00.000Z	js		hi. I saw that on karmic amd64, flash is used using nspluginwrapper? why that? is there a reason the native version isn't used?
2009-08-18T18:56:00.000Z	MsMaco	js	#ubuntu+1
2009-08-18T18:56:00.000Z	js	MsMaco	?
2009-08-18T18:56:00.000Z	js	MsMaco	ah, ok :)
2009-08-18T18:56:00.000Z	MsMaco	js	the native version isnt released as final, i think
2009-08-18T18:57:00.000Z	js	MsMaco	yeah, but karmic uses a lot of alpha sw ;)
2009-08-18T18:57:00.000Z	MsMaco	js	adobe only allows the final versions in the partner repo
2009-08-18T18:57:00.000Z	MsMaco	js	adobe wont allow it
2009-08-18T18:57:00.000Z	js	MsMaco	huh?
2009-08-18T18:57:00.000Z	MsMaco	js	adobe will not allow non-final versions of flash in the repository
2009-08-18T18:57:00.000Z	MsMaco	js	that is their contract
2009-08-18T18:57:00.000Z	js	MsMaco	not even in the alpha repository?
2009-08-18T18:58:00.000Z	MsMaco	js	no because then people would expect it to be in the released version of karmic
2009-08-18T18:58:00.000Z	MsMaco	js	youtube has an html5 version available..
2009-08-18T18:58:00.000Z	js	MsMaco	that unfortunately doesn't work with ff3.5 as it doesn't use theora :(
2009-08-18T19:00:00.000Z	js	MsMaco	is there any way to get flash working with pulseaudio?
2009-08-18T19:00:00.000Z	MsMaco	js	it should work automatically...
2009-08-18T19:01:00.000Z	js	MsMaco	sure doesn't. it tries to use alsa, fails, uses /dev/dsp and blocks everything
2009-08-18T19:02:00.000Z	MsMaco	js	which version of ubuntu? it should have routed to pulseaudio instead of dsp when it tried to use alsa directly...
2009-08-18T19:06:00.000Z	js	MsMaco	karmic alpha 4
2009-08-18T19:07:00.000Z	MsMaco	js	hmm dunno. but that's a #ubuntu+1 question. im running karmic too, but im using open source flash
