2010-04-11T06:14:00.000Z	The_Serpent		i've installed windows like 20 times.  just new to linux
2010-04-11T06:14:00.000Z	The_Serpent		i did make one actually...not sure if its made right.  i used partition magic in windows to make it
2010-04-11T06:15:00.000Z	The_Serpent		i looked at the files in it and thought it looked strange lol
2010-04-11T06:15:00.000Z	The_Serpent		alrighty
2010-04-11T06:17:00.000Z	The_Serpent		oh yea i tried using that usb creator program and it wouldn't copy to my flash drive.  just had the exclamation point next to it and i couldn't figure out why it hated me
2010-04-11T06:18:00.000Z	The_Serpent		i just want the virtual drive for my ubuntu to be bigger is all...i dont want to uninstall it
2010-04-11T06:20:00.000Z	The_Serpent		how? on its own or is there a command?
2010-04-11T06:20:00.000Z	The_Serpent		i would install it to its own dedicated partition but the usb creator hates my flash drive lol
2010-04-11T06:20:00.000Z	The_Serpent		guest - i have no idea lol
2010-04-11T06:22:00.000Z	The_Serpent		oh ok well i guess its only as big as it is then cause i dont think i did that.  i didn't even realize what the 17gb i set was going to be for lol
2010-04-11T06:23:00.000Z	kazagistar	The_Serpent	I had usb-creator problems too, just use unetbootin from the web site
2010-04-11T06:23:00.000Z	The_Serpent		the main problem is i cant seem to get my usb creator to actually use my flash drive.  it recognizes it but would format or create a boot disk out of it
2010-04-11T06:23:00.000Z	The_Serpent		unetbootin? ok
2010-04-11T06:24:00.000Z	kazagistar		usb-creator kept randomly segfaulting on me, its just a very buggy program
2010-04-11T06:25:00.000Z	The_Serpent		yea it has a exclamation point next to my drive no matter what i do.  i even tried formatting it in windows and it still wont recognize it
2010-04-11T06:28:00.000Z	The_Serpent		ugh when i try to open unetbootin it says there are no applications installed that can read that file type lol
2010-04-11T06:30:00.000Z	The_Serpent		when i try to run unetbootin it just says this "There is no application installed for executable files"
2010-04-11T06:31:00.000Z	kazagistar	The_Serpent	did you get the statically linked executable from the sourceforge site, or the one in the repos? cause the one in the repos failed for me...
2010-04-11T06:32:00.000Z	The_Serpent	kazagistar	- i have no idea i just googled it and went to the first site on the list lol
2010-04-11T06:33:00.000Z	The_Serpent		ok it was from sourceforge...still didn't work i guess
2010-04-11T06:33:00.000Z	kazagistar	The_Serpent	ok, and then you downloaded, did a chmod +x, and ran it with sudo?
