2011-09-19T07:46:00.000Z	Nickel	zach2825	also, hello, and thanks for your time :D
2011-09-19T07:48:00.000Z	zach2825	Nickel	when you drag things to the panel it make a link to what ever you dragged... and when you delete the icon it deletes the link
2011-09-19T07:50:00.000Z	zach2825	Nickel	are you using unity?
2011-09-19T07:51:00.000Z	zach2825	Nickel	oo I see if you log out you can if you like to. change it to gnome classic. then you will be able to add things to the panel but unity sucks still cause its more restrictive the windows still
2011-09-19T07:52:00.000Z	Nickel	zach2825	so if i log back into unity afterwards, will it still be there?
2011-09-19T07:52:00.000Z	Nickel	zach2825	thanks for the help, gonna try that now
2011-09-19T07:54:00.000Z	zach2825	Nickel	how is it?
2011-09-19T07:55:00.000Z	Nickel	zach2825	don't have gnome classic, logged into ubuntu classic
2011-09-19T07:58:00.000Z	zach2825	Nickel	I see for now I don't think you can edit the unity bar
2011-09-19T07:58:00.000Z	Nickel	zach2825	even still, i quite like it
2011-09-19T07:58:00.000Z	Nickel	zach2825	can i hide the one i put on the desktop, by chance?
2011-09-19T07:59:00.000Z	Nickel	zach2825	like just... put the launcher elsewhere, but drag it onto the bar? :D
2011-09-19T08:02:00.000Z	Nickel	zach2825	can't name a folder .shortcut
2011-09-19T08:07:00.000Z	Nickel	zach2825	i hid it in the .shortcut folder, and it disappeared from the launcher
2011-09-19T08:10:00.000Z	Nickel	zach2825	tried it again
2011-09-19T08:12:00.000Z	zach2825	Nickel	NICE!!! easiest way I could think to do it...

2011-09-19T08:14:00.000Z	Nickel	zach2825	i'll go without, but thanks for all the help anyway, it's been a learning experience, lol
