2011-09-22T08:49:00.000Z	Pilot_51		It crashed or something and I can't start it back up because apparently Google sees the zombie as the process already running
2011-09-22T08:49:00.000Z	Xeneth	Pilot_51	Google?  Chrome?
2011-09-22T09:20:00.000Z	Xeneth	Pilot_51	The GUI would update every 5 sec for example, and the CLI would be from pressing enter.
2011-09-22T09:23:00.000Z	Xeneth	Pilot_51	Virtual = Swap.  True
2011-09-22T09:24:00.000Z	Pilot_51	Xeneth	So why do most of my processes show virtual memory usage in the hundreds of MiB while total swap usage just shows 244 KiB?
2011-09-22T09:25:00.000Z	Xeneth	Pilot_51	Not a guru in linux, so not sure.  What command you using?
2011-09-22T09:25:00.000Z	Pilot_51	Xeneth	No command, just looking at System Monitor with most of the Memory columns enabled
2011-09-22T09:28:00.000Z	Xeneth	Pilot_51	My system monitor only had Memory (RAM) and Swap (VMemory)
2011-09-22T09:29:00.000Z	Pilot_51	Xeneth	Yeah that's in the Resources tab, it's the Processes tab where I'm not sure what the memory values exactly mean
2011-09-22T09:29:00.000Z	Xeneth	Pilot_51	are you talking about the processes?
2011-09-22T09:31:00.000Z	Xeneth	Pilot_51	I think that memory is not current, but accumulative.  How much it has loaded from the start.  Mine is just rising only.
2011-09-22T09:31:00.000Z	Xeneth	Pilot_51	NvM, it just dropped.
2011-09-22T09:32:00.000Z	Pilot_51	Xeneth	Hmm... Well I've seen it drop before, though the one I monitor the most is Firefox which is notorious for memory leaks (I constantly need to restart it because memory gets full and starts using swap)
2011-09-22T09:34:00.000Z	Xeneth	Pilot_51	The Mem in the processes is RAM.  Some may go to SWAP, but it's MEMORY + SWAP
2011-09-22T09:35:00.000Z	Pilot_51	Xeneth	If I remember correctly, resident memory = physical memory, which is usually slightly higher than memory
2011-09-22T09:36:00.000Z	Xeneth	Pilot_51	Physical memory is memory.  Only reason it's normally lower because the OS uses some.
2011-09-22T09:41:00.000Z	Pilot_51	Xeneth	I guess what's really needed is proper documentation on exactly what the columns mean. It's not in the help files and so far haven't found anything online.
2011-09-22T09:43:00.000Z	Pilot_51	Xeneth	It's clear that they don't mean what I (and albeit most people) think they mean, especially the virtual memory column which adds up to be much higher than total physical+swap usage
2011-09-22T09:44:00.000Z	Xeneth	Pilot_51	True, but that's linux in general.  I believe the memory column in processes is revering memory usage.  Makes no distinguation between physical or swap.
2011-09-22T09:46:00.000Z	Xeneth	Pilot_51	LOL  it's late, and my typing is going down hill.  :P
2011-09-22T09:47:00.000Z	Pilot_51	Xeneth	night
