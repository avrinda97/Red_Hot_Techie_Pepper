2006-05-20T13:13:00.000Z	spikeb	alan|laptop	there's a driver for that, i'm almost positive. i will look

2006-05-20T13:15:00.000Z	alan|laptop	spikeb	should have been corrected, but it's not done yet
2006-05-20T13:15:00.000Z	spikeb	alan|laptop	so basically you don't have a choice but to wait for an update
2006-05-20T13:15:00.000Z	alan|laptop	spikeb	yeah, especially when i can't watch a fullscreen film :(
2006-05-20T13:15:00.000Z	alan|laptop	spikeb	exactly
2006-05-20T14:46:00.000Z	spikeb	alan|laptop	do you know if the bug in the xorg server you use has been fixed upstream yet?
2006-05-20T14:47:00.000Z	spikeb	alan|laptop	so it hasn't made it into ubuntu then. that sucks
