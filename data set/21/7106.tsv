2006-11-28T08:24:00.000Z	gavi1		I can't find anything on how to mount with xubuntu, and all of the command line instructions i can find are for dappy (I'm on edgy). help?
2006-11-28T08:24:00.000Z	gavi1		the file listing the mounts changed for edgy right?
2006-11-28T08:25:00.000Z	reverseblade	gavi1	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Mount
2006-11-28T08:26:00.000Z	gavi1	reverseblade	wiki only has instructions for ubuntu, using the graphical mouunter in gnome, im on xubuntu
2006-11-28T08:26:00.000Z	reverseblade	gavi1	No
2006-11-28T08:26:00.000Z	reverseblade	gavi1	just follow the link I have given
2006-11-28T08:54:00.000Z	reverseblade	gavi1	have you mount a linux part or win part ?
2006-11-28T08:54:00.000Z	gavi1	reverseblade	linux, ex2
2006-11-28T08:55:00.000Z	gavi1	reverseblade	and its empty (except for t he lost+found folder)
2006-11-28T08:55:00.000Z	reverseblade	gavi1	there are other tutorials for mount in the wiki.
2006-11-28T08:55:00.000Z	reverseblade	gavi1	does it have rw persmission for all ?
2006-11-28T08:56:00.000Z	gavi1	reverseblade	if i were to guess, i would say only root, but mount doesn't say who its rw for
2006-11-28T08:57:00.000Z	gavi1	reverseblade	file manager says root only, how can i change that?
2006-11-28T08:58:00.000Z	reverseblade	gavi1	have you tried chmod - R 755 /path/to/mount ?
2006-11-28T08:58:00.000Z	reverseblade	gavi1	sorry 777
2006-11-28T08:59:00.000Z	reverseblade	gavi1	or try to write to the mount as a root
2006-11-28T09:01:00.000Z	gavi1	reverseblade	that did the trick, thanks. I've never used chmod before, try to remember it for future use. maybe add that to the wiki! thanks again!
2006-11-28T09:02:00.000Z	reverseblade	gavi1	if you have used 777 that's a big security hole. trying to own the mound with chown -R my_user /path/to/mount might be a better solution
2006-11-28T09:03:00.000Z	gavi1	reverseblade	roger that, i should set it back to 755 first?
2006-11-28T09:03:00.000Z	reverseblade	gavi1	depending on your requirements. Having that said 755 is the defacto standard . But that depends as I told
2006-11-28T09:04:00.000Z	gavi1	reverseblade	ok, i think i get it. thanks again.
