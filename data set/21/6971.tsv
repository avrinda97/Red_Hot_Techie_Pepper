2007-08-13T07:52:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	fevel	you're probalby in the wrong directory
2007-08-13T07:56:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	fevel	what are you trying to compile again?
2007-08-13T07:56:00.000Z	fevel	IndyGunFreak	pidgin
2007-08-13T07:56:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	fevel	1.  you should download the .deb  if you don't want to do that, open a terminal, sudo apt-get build-dep gaim
2007-08-13T07:57:00.000Z	fevel	IndyGunFreak	what would that command do?
2007-08-13T07:57:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	fevel	that will want to install a ton of dependencies for GAIM(pidgin).. once those are installed, then run ./configure and make and make install
2007-08-13T08:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	fevel	is it working?
2007-08-31T06:51:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	fevel	lspci should identify your devices..
2008-03-20T07:27:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	fevel	you'll need a good saw, preferrably circular.. and soem carpentry skills
2008-04-16T07:11:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	fevel	you can't
2008-04-16T07:11:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	fevel	no you can't
2008-04-16T07:12:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	fevel	why would you want to upgrade to a beta version of Linux?
2008-04-16T07:13:00.000Z	fevel	IndyGunFreak	 My main system is 7.10 which I run virtualbox with a windows and another ubuntu virtually
2008-04-16T07:14:00.000Z	fevel	IndyGunFreak	 now you see... the other ubuntu is because I need a special gtkpod version that comes on its repos
2008-04-16T07:14:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	fevel	so you run an entire distribution just for a special verison of gtkpod?..
2008-04-16T07:15:00.000Z	fevel	IndyGunFreak	 its much simpler than compiling it from source. It has major issues
