2004-11-12T16:40:00.000Z	rapha		Hey, who from the Ubuntu team will want to know how to configure X for a particular hardware?
2004-11-12T16:41:00.000Z	stvn	rapha	the wiki
2004-11-12T16:42:00.000Z	rapha	stvn	But the Wiki says it shouldn't be edited right now...
2004-11-12T16:42:00.000Z	stvn	rapha	checked the new wiki?
2004-11-12T16:42:00.000Z	rapha	stvn	URL?
2004-11-12T16:44:00.000Z	stvn	rapha	ah, the new wiki is not yet fully operational, either wait or contact someone from the doc team
2004-11-12T16:44:00.000Z	rapha	stvn	Okay, thanks
2004-11-14T13:53:00.000Z	stvn	rapha	yeah, it's all over the news for the past 2 hours
2004-12-06T15:14:00.000Z	rapha	stvn	bootsplash.de
2004-12-06T15:15:00.000Z	rapha	stvn	And the latest version of SWSusp2 for 2.6.9 has the latest version of bootsplash included, this is what I recommend.
2004-12-06T15:16:00.000Z	stvn	rapha	hm, bootsplash is probably the best option, don't want to mess too much
2004-12-06T15:18:00.000Z	rapha	stvn	I'm using bootsplash for my girlfriends computer, too, and she's never complained about "the cute penguin".
2004-12-06T15:18:00.000Z	stvn	rapha	heh
2004-12-06T15:20:00.000Z	rapha	stvn	In that case put "console=/dev/null CONSOLE=/dev/null" into GRUBs config file
2004-12-06T15:20:00.000Z	stvn	rapha	not sure if 3 minutes of a black screen is more promising ;)
2004-12-06T15:21:00.000Z	stvn	rapha	staring at a black screen makes time seem slower ;)
2004-12-06T15:21:00.000Z	stvn	rapha	it probably is under a minute before gdm starts
2004-12-24T11:15:00.000Z	stvn	rapha	me
2004-12-24T11:17:00.000Z	rapha	stvn	Do you think it would have to be configurable through the preferences dialog?
2004-12-24T11:17:00.000Z	stvn	rapha	i wait for the list to appear and click on the notification area icon
2004-12-24T11:18:00.000Z	stvn	rapha	yeah, i can image some ppl want it to stay, dunno why ...
