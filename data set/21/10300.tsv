2005-04-11T13:01:00.000Z	MaRk-I		network tools wont let me
2005-04-11T13:02:00.000Z	MaRk-I		how come it asks me for "root" passwd when I didnt even set up one??
2005-04-11T13:02:00.000Z	geneo93	MaRk-I	 sudo network-admin
2005-04-11T13:03:00.000Z	geneo93	MaRk-I	 yes
2005-04-11T13:04:00.000Z	MaRk-I	geneo93	thnx I'll try that (when I log onto ubuntu again)
2005-04-11T13:04:00.000Z	geneo93	MaRk-I	 sudo use your passwd
2005-04-11T13:04:00.000Z	MaRk-I	geneo93	thanks yes that I've done but pisses me off on the GUI asking for root pass
2005-04-11T13:05:00.000Z	geneo93	MaRk-I	 your passwd would work
2005-04-11T13:05:00.000Z	MaRk-I	geneo93	nope says wrong pass or don't use caps etc.
2005-04-11T13:06:00.000Z	geneo93	MaRk-I	 you can set root passwd by doing sudo passwd root
2005-04-11T13:07:00.000Z	geneo93	MaRk-I	 are you using dhcp
2005-04-11T13:07:00.000Z	MaRk-I	geneo93	but if I havent set up one yet why it's asking for one??
2005-04-11T13:07:00.000Z	MaRk-I	geneo93	yes
2005-04-11T13:12:00.000Z	geneo93	MaRk-I	 you can boot to mandrake
2005-04-11T13:13:00.000Z	MaRk-I	geneo93	I'm on MDK right now
2005-04-11T13:15:00.000Z	MaRk-I	geneo93	with no eth0 working at all..... (no upgrades no connection) is like not having ubuntu lol
2005-04-11T13:17:00.000Z	MaRk-I	geneo93	1 last thing dmesg tells me: eth0: no IPv6 routers present;  any ideas??
2005-04-11T13:18:00.000Z	geneo93	MaRk-I	 there aren't really
