2011-04-25T06:00:00.000Z	Cheez		Anyone have any idea why ports wouldnt open up?
2011-04-25T06:00:00.000Z	edbian	Cheez	you have a router / firewall
2011-04-25T06:01:00.000Z	Cheez		I know
2011-04-25T06:01:00.000Z	Cheez		They used to open fine... then they just stoped working
2011-04-25T06:01:00.000Z	Cheez		The connection times out when i test them with canyouseeme.org
2011-04-25T06:01:00.000Z	edbian	Cheez	What do you mean?  Are we talking about a router or a firewall?
2011-04-25T06:01:00.000Z	Cheez		Router
2011-04-25T06:02:00.000Z	Cheez		I have ports opened for a server with a wired connection, and it works fine. But when i try to forward them with my laptop (wireless) they dont work,, and no one can connect to the server
2011-04-25T06:03:00.000Z	edbian	Cheez	Are you forwarding the port to the correct IP address?  (the IP of the laptop)
2011-04-25T06:03:00.000Z	Cheez		Yea its a dynamic ip. and i forwarded to the right internal IP. I know how to port forward and everything, but for some reason it just stopped working.
2011-04-25T06:04:00.000Z	edbian	Cheez	What service are you running on the laptop? Do you have a firewall running on it?
2011-04-25T06:05:00.000Z	Cheez		yes i do have a firewall, but it is unblocking the port
2011-04-25T06:05:00.000Z	edbian	Cheez	For the sake of argument why don't you turn the firewall off on the laptop.
2011-04-25T06:05:00.000Z	Cheez		Ok... but i think this is something wrong with my router :/
2011-04-25T06:06:00.000Z	Cheez		Because the firewall has never caused me problems when port forwarding
2011-04-25T06:06:00.000Z	edbian	Cheez	Well can you connect to your server (on the laptop) from another machine on the LAN ?
2011-04-25T06:06:00.000Z	Cheez		Yea i can
2011-04-25T06:06:00.000Z	Cheez		wait
2011-04-25T06:06:00.000Z	Cheez		yea using a direct url
2011-04-25T06:11:00.000Z	Cheez		any ideas?
2011-04-25T06:12:00.000Z	Cheez	edbian	do you think there might be something wrong with my router? i just reinstalled the firmware, and it didnt fix it
