2006-06-07T06:36:00.000Z	earthen		anyone know how to start the server install from the desktop install CD
2006-06-07T06:36:00.000Z	Flannel	earthen	you can't, I don't think.
2006-06-07T06:37:00.000Z	earthen	Flannel	mmm that strange considering it's is basicly the same with out any gui
2006-06-07T06:37:00.000Z	Flannel	earthen	you're talking about the liveCD installer, right?
2006-06-07T06:38:00.000Z	earthen	Flannel	yeah I think so, it's the dapper x86 install cd
2006-06-07T06:38:00.000Z	Flannel	earthen	the LiveCD one, right?
2006-06-07T06:39:00.000Z	earthen	Flannel	and it bootin into a live cd right now
2006-06-07T06:39:00.000Z	Flannel	earthen	right, I don't know if you can select a server install from that.  you definately can't choose the LAMP preinstall and stuff.  on the alternative (text-mode) installer, you can just type 'server' and install without ubuntu-desktop
2006-06-07T06:39:00.000Z	earthen	Flannel	I trying to install the server to an old PII 300 to make a  web caching server and porn filter so the live cd is going freakin slow
2006-06-07T06:40:00.000Z	Flannel	earthen	right, you probably should download the server iso.  you could use alternate installer, but server is 300mb smaller, and has optomized kernels
2006-06-07T06:40:00.000Z	earthen	Flannel	what is the LAMP preinstall
2006-06-07T06:41:00.000Z	earthen	Flannel	I C I guess I'm gonna have to down load that then
2006-06-07T06:41:00.000Z	earthen	Flannel	I have a limit to how much I can down load I downloaded the desktop version last night I was hopinh i could use it to do both
2006-06-07T06:41:00.000Z	Flannel	earthen	well, you can.
2006-06-07T06:42:00.000Z	Flannel	earthen	but, the liveCD might be too much for that computer.
2006-06-07T06:42:00.000Z	Flannel	earthen	since you can't install without going through the liveCD on that computer
2006-06-07T06:43:00.000Z	earthen	Flannel	O yeah I know it is! but I have a server set up on the same system fro someone else and it runs and does it's job exptreemly well
2006-06-07T06:43:00.000Z	Flannel	earthen	right, you can install via that, sure.  you'll just have to remove ubuntu-desktop after you install it.
2006-06-07T06:44:00.000Z	earthen	Flannel	 yeah that's too bad
2006-06-07T06:44:00.000Z	earthen	Flannel	I'm just gonna have to bite the bullet and down load the server edition, guess I'm gonna have to limit my porn downloadin for this month LOL
2006-06-07T06:45:00.000Z	earthen	Flannel	thanks for the info
