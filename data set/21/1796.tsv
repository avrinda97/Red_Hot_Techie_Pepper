2010-05-14T03:19:00.000Z	ethana3		I have a toshiba satellite with a bios so horrible it can do _nothing_ but boot directly from the boot partition
2010-05-14T03:19:00.000Z	ethana3		I took the HDD out, hooked it up to my other laptop via usb, and I'm running off of it right now
2010-05-14T03:20:00.000Z	ethana3		I need to force it to use VESA, how do I do this?
2010-05-14T03:21:00.000Z	ethana3		can gparted install grub on specific partitions?
2010-05-14T03:23:00.000Z	ethana3		it's the most horrible bios in the history of man
2010-05-14T03:25:00.000Z	ethana3		it's a bios from HELL.
2010-05-14T03:26:00.000Z	ethana3		no wait, that'll make 'open' just run one app...
2010-05-14T03:26:00.000Z	ethana3		I don't know how to do that.....
2010-05-14T03:26:00.000Z	ethana3		how do I make it use VESA?
2010-05-14T03:27:00.000Z	Loshki	ethana3	lots of them are. Manufacturers also cripple bioses to reduce misconfiguration and hence support calls...
2010-05-14T03:27:00.000Z	ethana3	Loshki	that's what I figure happened
2010-05-14T03:28:00.000Z	Loshki	ethana3	I see crippled bioses on HPs a lot...
2010-05-14T03:28:00.000Z	Loshki	ethana3	try gogeta's suggestion...
2010-05-14T03:36:00.000Z	Loshki	ethana3	if the bios ignores the mbr, how does it boot *anything*?
2010-05-14T03:40:00.000Z	Loshki	ethana3	gogeta: right, see Jordan_U's message above about broken bioses...
2010-05-14T03:40:00.000Z	ethana3	Loshki	what message?
2010-05-14T03:41:00.000Z	Loshki	ethana3	"....There are some *extremely* broken BIOSs that actually look for the boot flag in the partition table and chainload that partition, which is what Microsoft's MBR code does, rather than executing the MBR itself...." -- Jordan_U
2010-05-14T03:41:00.000Z	ethana3	Loshki	exactly what's going on here
2010-05-14T04:25:00.000Z	Loshki	ethana3	I've never saved such a change from grub. I thought it was temporary only good for that particular bootup...
2010-05-14T04:26:00.000Z	ethana3	Loshki	I don't even see any effect in the same booting up
2010-05-14T04:27:00.000Z	Loshki	ethana3	you have to make the edit, hit return, and then boot it immediately using 'b'... (this is from memory. I use it when I want a single user boot instead of keeping special grub entries)
