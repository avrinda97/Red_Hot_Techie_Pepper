2011-04-20T05:37:00.000Z	Jonii2		So, one day, without me changing anything, grubs Timer to auto boot linux disappeared. Now i can't boot linux, it sends me straight to busybox after giving me this error: "mount: mounting /proc on /root/pro failed: No such file or directory."  Some other errors follow, but they look like they are based on this first one.
2011-04-20T05:37:00.000Z	Jonii2		any ideas?
2011-04-20T05:38:00.000Z	Diamondcite	Jonii2	Did you add/remove any physical drives?
2011-04-20T05:39:00.000Z	Jonii2	Diamondcite	No, that was my first reaction, but we haven't changed anything hardware wise, except i plugged in and xbox controller. Problem occurs with the controller in our out
2011-04-20T05:41:00.000Z	Diamondcite	Jonii2	Maybe you can boot a livecd/usb and see if any new /dev/sd* devices showed up?
2011-04-20T05:42:00.000Z	Diamondcite	Jonii2	Another thing the liveCD offers the the ability to boot from the first drive.. assuming that can get past grub on the HD..
2011-04-20T05:42:00.000Z	Jonii2	Diamondcite	how would i know if they are new? I have windows on here, but I don't remember what /dev/sd was on there before
2011-04-20T05:42:00.000Z	Jonii2	Diamondcite	i can get past grub, its just ubuntu that won't work
2011-04-20T05:42:00.000Z	Diamondcite	Jonii2	How many physical drives do you have?
2011-04-20T05:43:00.000Z	Diamondcite	Jonii2	If it's busy box, then it's not past grub yet..
2011-04-20T05:43:00.000Z	Jonii2	Diamondcite	1 hard drive  1(maybe 2?) CD drives, 1 floppy
2011-04-20T05:44:00.000Z	Diamondcite	Jonii2	Did you do a kernel update recently?
2011-04-20T05:45:00.000Z	Jonii2	Diamondcite	not that i know of, but maybe, i tried booting the old kernel with the grub menu though, it did the same thing
2011-04-20T05:46:00.000Z	Diamondcite	Jonii2	If you can ever get it to boot fully. I might suggest re-installing one of the kernels? It feels like grub was interrupted..
2011-04-20T05:46:00.000Z	Jonii2	Diamondcite	I can get it to boot fully only into windows
2011-04-20T05:47:00.000Z	Diamondcite	Jonii2	Not really.. but I don't have enough time to go into great detail at the moment..
2011-04-20T05:47:00.000Z	Jonii2	Diamondcite	 ok
2011-04-20T05:49:00.000Z	Jonii2	Diamondcite	so in other words my computer is dead and i get to reinstall everything again?
2011-04-20T05:50:00.000Z	Diamondcite	Jonii2	Assuming you didn't get hurt by extremely room shortage.. a liveCD/USB can rescue any ubuntu system with the use of a 'chroot'. But I don't have time for this.
2011-04-20T05:50:00.000Z	Jonii2	Diamondcite	ok i'll try that
2011-04-20T05:51:00.000Z	Diamondcite	Jonii2	The basic idea is to chroot into the HDD and re-install a kernel to trigger grub again to see what happens
