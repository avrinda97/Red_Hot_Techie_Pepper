2007-11-19T17:39:00.000Z	IdleOne	sybariten	just like that? yeah give it a shot but probably wont work but then again never know
2007-11-19T17:40:00.000Z	sybariten	IdleOne	i do think centericq and centerIM are very similar forks though, and centericq runs fine here on dapper....  but then again i'm no developer....  thanks for the help!
2007-11-19T17:41:00.000Z	IdleOne	sybariten	you can try compiling it from source also
2007-11-19T17:42:00.000Z	sybariten	IdleOne	uh, i realize now that i'm a bit confused as to where to find the actual .deb file... could you give me a pointer?
2007-11-19T17:42:00.000Z	IdleOne	sybariten	gimme a minute
2007-11-19T17:48:00.000Z	IdleOne	sybariten	scroll down a little to Download Box
2007-11-19T17:49:00.000Z	IdleOne	sybariten	download the appropriate version for your machine
2007-11-19T17:51:00.000Z	sybariten	IdleOne	jrib : ah, ok ok, i pressed the wrong link...  list of files.... thank you!
2007-11-19T17:52:00.000Z	IdleOne	sybariten	np at the top of that page there is a link top the centerim page. if the .deb doesnt work you can probably download and compile the source yourself and it should have instructions there but try the deb first
2007-11-19T17:55:00.000Z	sybariten	IdleOne	ok ... by the way i got a lot of dependecy problems... to say the least. Is there a way to tell dpkg to go out and fetch dependencies, even more thouroughly ... or is it already configured for that with the -i option?
2008-02-21T21:10:00.000Z	IdleOne	sybariten	if you mean gcc and that you need build-essential
2008-02-21T21:11:00.000Z	sybariten	IdleOne	i suppose thats what i want, yes... build-essential... thanks
2008-02-21T21:11:00.000Z	IdleOne	sybariten	that package will install all the tools needed for compiling. check in synaptic before you compile as there already may be what you want pre-packaged in the repos
2008-02-21T21:12:00.000Z	sybariten	IdleOne	neverblue : hmmmmm.....      Failed to fetch http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/l/linux-source-2.6.22/linux-libc-dev_2.6.22-14.47_i386.deb  404 Not Found
2008-02-21T21:14:00.000Z	IdleOne	sybariten	look on packages.ubuntu.com make sure that is the correct file name
2008-02-21T21:17:00.000Z	sybariten	IdleOne	i followed neverblues tip, never got to looking at the packages page
2008-02-21T21:18:00.000Z	IdleOne	sybariten	it worked? if so I am glad
2008-02-21T21:19:00.000Z	IdleOne	sybariten	packages.ubuntu.com is a great place to get packages if lets say you need something for a machine without internet access or whatever.
2010-01-17T05:45:00.000Z	IdleOne	sybariten	I think this is what you want https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent
2010-01-17T05:47:00.000Z	sybariten	IdleOne	"persistent" method is a middle way, i think
