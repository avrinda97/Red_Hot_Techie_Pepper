2007-12-12T11:45:00.000Z	jude		can anyone help me with this : whenever i play any videos, in fullscreen mode the video does not come clear(it does not refresh correctly)
2007-12-12T11:45:00.000Z	silent_	jude	I advise VLC, stat
2007-12-12T11:45:00.000Z	jude		I'll try, thks
2007-12-12T11:46:00.000Z	silent_		I haven't built up enough curiosity to try kde... I'm a gnomefreak
2007-12-12T11:51:00.000Z	jude	silent_	does not help.I just installed vlc
2007-12-12T11:58:00.000Z	silent_	jude	that is odd indeed, does your graphics processor blow?
2007-12-12T11:59:00.000Z	jude	silent_	it does not
2007-12-12T11:59:00.000Z	jude		i got this problem just last week
2007-12-12T12:01:00.000Z	silent_	jude	Are you using the proper drivers?
2007-12-12T12:01:00.000Z	silent_	jude	check your cpu usage when in full screen
2007-12-12T12:02:00.000Z	jude	silent_	my drivers are correct, in fullscreen mode the CPU usage is 100%
2007-12-12T12:03:00.000Z	silent_	jude	there ya are
2007-12-12T12:04:00.000Z	silent_	jude	what processor, by chance?
2007-12-12T12:04:00.000Z	jude	silent_	bu why does it go to full?? Only in the fullscreen mode
2007-12-12T12:04:00.000Z	jude		AMD Athlon 64 bit 2800+
2007-12-12T12:09:00.000Z	silent_	jude	Because it requires more!!! but seriously there could be a resource drain... some sort of loop somewhere, check which process is using the cpu
2007-12-12T12:09:00.000Z	jude	silent_	ok
2007-12-12T12:12:00.000Z	jude	silent_	i don't see anything that takes a lot, actually if i add them it comes to 20% in fullscreen mode
2007-12-12T12:12:00.000Z	silent_	jude	not possible if it's hitting 100% ... nothing is greater than the sum of it's parts
2007-12-12T12:13:00.000Z	silent_		brb, restarting X cause I'm cool like that
2007-12-12T12:19:00.000Z	jude	silent_	i'm sure about it. it adds to 20%
