2009-12-19T19:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chitebbeiv	 if you apt-get install whatever   and whatever is allready intalled.. it will just skip it i thought
2009-12-19T19:31:00.000Z	chitebbeiv	Dr_Willis	it does not...
2009-12-19T19:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chitebbeiv	 it does here. I just tried it.
2009-12-19T19:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		sudo apt-get install whatever      just prints a message about it being allready installed..    renameutils is already the newest version.
2009-12-19T19:32:00.000Z	chitebbeiv		Dr_Willis
2009-12-19T19:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chitebbeiv	 i got about a 50 line script i use on every new install that apt-get installs several dozen packages, and sets up some repos and other things.
2009-12-19T19:33:00.000Z	chitebbeiv	Dr_Willis	can you send me that script?
2009-12-19T19:33:00.000Z	chitebbeiv	Dr_Willis	please...
2009-12-19T19:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chitebbeiv	 its just a bunch of 'sudo apt-get install thispackage thatpackage thisotherpackage'        lines
2009-12-19T19:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chitebbeiv	 with some comments about what its isntalling.
2009-12-19T19:34:00.000Z	chitebbeiv	Dr_Willis	it's exactly what I do and what I need, but mine doesn't work
2009-12-19T19:35:00.000Z	chitebbeiv	Dr_Willis	this is mine sudo apt-get install build-essential startupmanager ubuntu-restricted-extras p7zip-full unrar conky conkyforecast
2009-12-19T19:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chitebbeiv	 thats about what i use.  whats the error it gives.
2009-12-19T19:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chitebbeiv	 if any ONE of those package names is wrong the whole line wont work.
2009-12-19T19:36:00.000Z	chitebbeiv		no errors, but when it find an already installed package it stops everything
2009-12-19T19:36:00.000Z	chitebbeiv	Dr_Willis	names are all correct
2009-12-19T19:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chitebbeiv	 so if you 'sudo apt-get install  renameutils'   then run 'sudo apt-get install renameutils' what does it say the 2nd time?
2009-12-19T19:37:00.000Z	chitebbeiv		that it's already installed, but my problem is to let install the other packages in the list
2009-12-19T19:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chitebbeiv	 you could just do 1 package at a time i guess.. ive never noticed it failing  befor tha way
2009-12-19T19:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chitebbeiv	 i just did a -->  sudo apt-get install renameutils  bloboats  blockout2
2009-12-19T19:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chitebbeiv	 and it worked.. even tho i had renameutils and bloboats allready installed.. it just instgalled blockout2 here
