2005-09-12T13:30:00.000Z	dreameen		alsa is not working in beep media player , what can i do?
2005-09-12T13:30:00.000Z	bob2	dreameen	kill esd
2005-09-12T13:33:00.000Z	bob2	dreameen	because everything else is worse
2005-09-12T13:33:00.000Z	bob2	dreameen	and what do you think is better?
2005-09-12T13:34:00.000Z	dreameen	bob2	alsa?
2005-09-12T13:34:00.000Z	bob2	dreameen	do you know how to generate a correct dmix config for every sound card the kernel supports?
2005-09-12T13:35:00.000Z	bob2	dreameen	no, it doesn't
2005-09-12T13:35:00.000Z	bob2	dreameen	not with the version in hoary
2005-09-12T13:37:00.000Z	bob2	dreameen	are you going to port every single app to ALSA?
2005-09-12T13:38:00.000Z	bob2	dreameen	and make ALSA work on Solaris and *BSD?
2005-09-12T13:38:00.000Z	dreameen	bob2	most of apps use alsa anyway
2005-09-12T13:39:00.000Z	bob2	dreameen	most, yes, but not nearly enough to throw away OSS entirely
2005-09-12T13:39:00.000Z	dreameen	bob2	i mean they should be around for some time but i see no point in having multiple sound systems in the first place
2005-09-12T13:40:00.000Z	bob2	dreameen	so everyone should stick with OSS?
2005-09-12T13:40:00.000Z	dreameen	bob2	alsa all the way
2005-09-12T13:40:00.000Z	bob2	dreameen	right, let's go in time to 1991 and make linux use ALSA fro mthe veginning
2005-09-12T13:41:00.000Z	dreameen	bob2	thatd be the best thing to do:)
2005-09-12T13:44:00.000Z	bob2	dreameen	wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo, there isn't one
2005-09-12T13:49:00.000Z	bob2	dreameen	there is no "best"
2005-09-12T13:49:00.000Z	bob2	dreameen	slrn has been popular for a decade, tho
2005-09-12T14:46:00.000Z	dreameen	bob2	vesa driver fot Ati cards..
