2007-03-30T14:52:00.000Z	gordonjcp	linuxnooblah	seriously, some things "just plain work" in Wine, some work with a bit of fiddling, and some are a lost cause

2007-03-30T14:53:00.000Z	linuxnooblah		ventrilo

2007-03-30T14:57:00.000Z	gordonjcp	linuxnooblah	I don't know what ventrilo is
2007-03-30T14:57:00.000Z	gordonjcp	linuxnooblah	you'd have just about as much trouble trying to run Mac software in Windows...
