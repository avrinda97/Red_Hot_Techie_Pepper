2008-05-21T06:13:00.000Z	Firefishe		I'm getting strange errors when reading certain .mp3 files on either xmms or amarok from my linux side:  Some output:  http://pastebin.com/m481f446f
2008-05-21T06:13:00.000Z	Firefishe		ie, linux side reading ntfs partition
2008-05-21T06:14:00.000Z	BinaryFu	Firefishe	Have you tried to drag them on over to a Linux partition and see if you get the same issue?
2008-05-21T06:15:00.000Z	Firefishe	BinaryFu	 I've tried that before, but  usually get the same problem.
2008-05-21T06:15:00.000Z	Firefishe	BinaryFu	 did you read the pastebin?
2008-05-21T06:15:00.000Z	BinaryFu	Firefishe	No, toss it out there again?
2008-05-21T06:16:00.000Z	BinaryFu	Firefishe	What kind of error do you get if you run it from a Linux partition though?
2008-05-21T06:17:00.000Z	BinaryFu	Firefishe	I'm guessing not an NTFS-fs error
2008-05-21T06:17:00.000Z	Firefishe	BinaryFu	 That is the error I get when running it from the linux partition.  I'm using either xmms or amarok to read the file *on the ntfs partition*.  That output is in ALT-F1 Terminal.
2008-05-21T06:18:00.000Z	BinaryFu	Firefishe	Okay, maybe I'm not too clear on how I say this..."If the music file, is relocated to the Linux partition, and then played, while in Linux...what happens?"
2008-05-21T06:19:00.000Z	BinaryFu	Firefishe	It's been handled as well as Paris Hilton.
2008-05-21T06:25:00.000Z	BinaryFu	Firefishe	So...wait a sec....
2008-05-21T06:25:00.000Z	Firefishe	BinaryFu	 k
2008-05-21T06:25:00.000Z	BinaryFu	Firefishe	You have a problem transferring data from one "supposedly" fine partition, to one that's obviously working just peachy...
2008-05-21T06:25:00.000Z	BinaryFu	Firefishe	And the file's corrupt?
2008-05-21T06:26:00.000Z	BinaryFu	Firefishe	It could be possible that bazhang NAILED the issue in under 20 seconds when he said your NTFS partition could have an issue.
2008-05-21T06:27:00.000Z	BinaryFu	Firefishe	I'd do what bazhang says, the words spoken are wise indeed.
2008-05-21T06:27:00.000Z	Firefishe	BinaryFu	 There are two music files in that folder.  I successfully tranfered the other one over, and it is playing fine.  The other one not only didn't transfer completely and gave me an error, but it also gave that weird output at http://pastebin.com/m481f446f when played in a music player.
2008-05-21T06:28:00.000Z	BinaryFu	Firefishe	If the defrag doesn't cut it, then yeah, the file itself could have been chopped up and served to some mean codemonger as sushi.
2008-05-21T06:30:00.000Z	Firefishe	BinaryFu	bazhang:  One other weird thing is, when I boot into doze, it takes *forever*.  The h/d spins and spins and spins, then, after about 5 minutes, finally stops, but occasionally speeds up again, hangs everything up for a long time, then quiets down again.
2008-05-21T06:31:00.000Z	BinaryFu	Firefishe	Sounds like that drive is going up.
