2007-04-22T14:24:00.000Z	antidrugue		Z: or transmission is very lightweight
2007-04-22T14:24:00.000Z	antidrugue		Z: nah, bittorrent and bittornado takes quite a lot of ressources
2007-04-22T14:25:00.000Z	antidrugue		!windows
2007-04-22T14:25:00.000Z	antidrugue		Z_: i use azureus
2007-04-22T14:26:00.000Z	antidrugue		Z_: i compared all the clients ressources usage (in "top")
2007-04-22T14:26:00.000Z	antidrugue		Z_: and azureus actualy use a lot less CPU than bittorrent or bitornado
2007-04-22T14:27:00.000Z	antidrugue		shynx: what's with the ipw2200 ?
2007-04-22T14:28:00.000Z	sphynx	antidrugue	I have it working while LiveCD session, but NetworkManager doesn't show it after installation :(
2007-04-22T14:28:00.000Z	sphynx	antidrugue	then I've tried to down/up my eth1, but it didn't help
2007-04-22T14:29:00.000Z	sphynx	antidrugue	then I've rebooted, and my wifi was shown like eth1:avahi or something like this
2007-04-22T14:31:00.000Z	sphynx	antidrugue	yes, I've tried this, nothing special
2007-04-22T14:32:00.000Z	sphynx	antidrugue	it shows that ipw2200 was loaded, some zones were detected
2007-04-22T14:32:00.000Z	antidrugue	sphynx	and iwconfig ?
2007-04-22T14:32:00.000Z	sphynx	antidrugue	iwconfig shows that I am NOT associated with any network
2007-04-22T14:33:00.000Z	sphynx	antidrugue	but shows my eth1
2007-04-22T14:33:00.000Z	antidrugue	sphynx	but it does list eth1 as wireless?
2007-04-22T14:34:00.000Z	sphynx	antidrugue	yes, it lists eth1 as wifi
2007-04-22T14:36:00.000Z	antidrugue	sphynx	i have an ipw2200 also, and i can connect with WPA network fine from the liveCD
2007-04-22T14:37:00.000Z	sphynx	antidrugue	I can connect with live cd too! (Now I'm in livecd session) But with installed Feisty - I can't.
