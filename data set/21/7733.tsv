2010-04-09T10:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	WebRat	It can also be downloaded seperatly, but I woudn't useually recommend it.
2010-04-09T10:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	WebRat	Grub 2 is the default boot loader for proper partitioned clean installs of 9.10
2010-04-09T10:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	WebRat	Wubi edits the boot loader so it can boot up Grub/Grub2,  which then boots up Ubuntu.  Wubi itself goes in a file in the Windows partition,  and it seems you can only open your Windows files using Wubi as read only.
2010-04-09T10:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	WebRat	no you don't partition Wubi,  you get what you get and that's that,  also there's a program that can later convert a Wubi install into real partition/s
2010-04-09T10:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	WebRat	indeed if you set up a proper partitioned install and use the manual  install option so you can make seperate /home
2010-04-09T10:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	WebRat	since guided installs don't do seperate /home
2010-04-09T10:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	WebRat	no Wubi does not  have a seperate /home and it doesn't need one, since Wubi in that kind of way, isn't like a proper install
2010-04-09T10:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	WebRat	boot Live CD,  follow installer through, set up partitions in manual install,  finnish instaler, done
2010-04-09T10:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	WebRat	back up any important data just in case,  and re sizing Windows will probably go rather well.  Altough if Windows 7 is like Vista when it comes to this, should let it resize itself using it's tool,  or dataloss might happen.
2010-04-09T10:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	WebRat	ok :)
2010-04-09T10:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	WebRat	well put  Ubuntu on the other partition, and the Windows partition won't get effected
