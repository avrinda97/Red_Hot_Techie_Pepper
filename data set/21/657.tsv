2011-08-10T16:18:00.000Z	ArchLinuxman	maptz	you could open up a can of worms with a quick fix....
2011-08-10T15:59:00.000Z	ArchLinuxman	maptz	what is are you trying to do with samba
2011-08-10T16:00:00.000Z	maptz	ArchLinuxman	I have a remote bdc, and I want to join it to the domain of my pdc
2011-08-10T16:01:00.000Z	maptz	ArchLinuxman	When i try to join the domain or get the SID, my server is 'unable to find a suitable domain', but with IP argument it's work
2011-08-10T16:02:00.000Z	maptz	ArchLinuxman	so i'm trying to solve my name resolution problem
2011-08-10T16:06:00.000Z	maptz	ArchLinuxman	Do you think it could be due to my environnement test (samba pdc is a virtual machine with nat enable on the host)?
2011-08-10T16:07:00.000Z	ArchLinuxman	maptz	your starting to try to many things at once and what is worse are you using ubuntu as the server....
2011-08-10T16:07:00.000Z	maptz	ArchLinuxman	yes, i have a ubuntu server
2011-08-10T16:09:00.000Z	ArchLinuxman	maptz	try a debian or slackware server if it is only for Samba!!!!! Ubuntu makes a great desktop ,but it can run it problems as a server...
2011-08-10T16:11:00.000Z	maptz	ArchLinuxman	thank you, I'll try that
2011-08-10T16:12:00.000Z	ArchLinuxman	maptz	first off join samba pose question there I am not the authority on getting it to work properly it may be a simple fix
2011-08-10T16:15:00.000Z	maptz	ArchLinuxman	I'm currently waiting for answers in samba channel
2011-08-10T16:16:00.000Z	maptz	ArchLinuxman	I don't really enjoy to reinstall a debian because it's look be very close to work
2011-08-10T16:17:00.000Z	ArchLinuxman	maptz	not now this must be on weekend with spare time also I would check to see all hardware is compatible before install
2011-08-10T16:20:00.000Z	ArchLinuxman	maptz	Look get some other advice then just me... There are lots of people out there that could have a better way and great advice... I am not god I don't know everything...
2011-08-10T16:23:00.000Z	maptz	ArchLinuxman	Sure, but your warning on ubuntu server was an idea, I note it an then if I confirm it I'll follow you. So thank you for your advice
2011-08-10T16:25:00.000Z	ArchLinuxman	maptz	its sound advice, but your setup or idea is the bigger question of why are you running a VM machine if you plan to do a regular install????
2011-08-10T16:29:00.000Z	maptz	ArchLinuxman	It's a choice of my sysadmin to keep network and systemes safe... just in case. I'm in internship so I'm working in virtual machines but i'm pretty sure my configuration work in prod environement
2011-08-10T16:32:00.000Z	ArchLinuxman	maptz	Wow, I was an inter for a hospital they kept trying to hire me..  Funny never got told to leave a server alone or the network alone...
2011-08-10T16:36:00.000Z	maptz	ArchLinuxman	Lucky guy... in my case I'm punished with virtualbox :D
2011-08-10T16:36:00.000Z	ArchLinuxman	maptz	I will meet you in the samba room
