2012-07-16T18:05:00.000Z	kanliot	glitchd	is there a ubuntu package for teamspeak?
2012-07-16T18:05:00.000Z	glitchd	kanliot	not a .deb package, but a tar.gz package.
2012-07-16T18:05:00.000Z	glitchd	kanliot	i already have the server installed installed
2012-07-16T18:06:00.000Z	kanliot	glitchd	tar.gz can be difficult, but if you have good instructions you should be able to do it
2012-07-16T18:11:00.000Z	glitchd	kanliot	so.....help?
2012-07-16T18:12:00.000Z	kanliot	glitchd	wheres the instructions for the tar.gz?

2012-07-16T18:18:00.000Z	kanliot	glitchd	without instructions what do you want me to do?

2012-07-16T18:21:00.000Z	glitchd	kanliot	maybe i didnt explain well enough
2012-07-16T18:21:00.000Z	glitchd	kanliot	im trying to run a teamspeak server from inside a virtual machine that i can connect to on the host machine and that all my other friends on the net can connect to.
2012-07-16T18:22:00.000Z	glitchd	kanliot	thats not exactly right..
2012-07-16T18:22:00.000Z	glitchd	kanliot	i have it installed already.
2012-07-16T18:24:00.000Z	kanliot	glitchd	if your friends can connect and you cant, try running in bridged network on the vm
