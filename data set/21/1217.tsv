2010-12-23T03:42:00.000Z	psionicsin		Hey guys! I'm new to Linux, and am trying to run Ubuntu as a live CD/DVD first to get a feel for it, but it keeps failing to mount or something and I have no idea what I'm doing wrong.
2010-12-23T03:44:00.000Z	psionicsin		I have an Intel 1-i7-950, 24GB of RAM, and 8 x 1TB HDD's. It should be able to run this I believe.
2010-12-23T03:46:00.000Z	psionicsin		Lockersnatch. Nope. Under $2500
2010-12-23T03:46:00.000Z	sam-_-	psionicsin	either the dvd is broken or the drive
2010-12-23T03:52:00.000Z	sam-_-	psionicsin	it's a sata drive, right?
2010-12-23T03:53:00.000Z	sam-_-	psionicsin	no the cd/dvd
2010-12-23T03:53:00.000Z	sam-_-	psionicsin	maybe you can tell your bios to set ide compatibility for this sata port?
2010-12-23T03:54:00.000Z	sam-_-	psionicsin	then without?
2010-12-23T04:27:00.000Z	sam-_-	psionicsin	i don't think the cd are corrupt. it would spit out a read error
2010-12-23T04:27:00.000Z	sam-_-	psionicsin	it seems linux can't access/find your dvd drive
2010-12-23T04:32:00.000Z	sam-_-	psionicsin	the booting is not done by linux but by the bootloader that's why
2010-12-23T04:33:00.000Z	psionicsin	sam-_-	is there a way to find out the correct way to do this for my system before I move on to a ubd drive?
2010-12-23T04:33:00.000Z	psionicsin	sam-_-	I would like to exhaust all current CD/DVD drive options before jumping ship.
2010-12-23T04:34:00.000Z	psionicsin	sam-_-	 yes
2010-12-23T04:39:00.000Z	sam-_-	psionicsin	i would poke around in dmesg| grep -i dvd  or cd and maybe do a ls /dev
2010-12-23T04:40:00.000Z	sam-_-	psionicsin	busybox is quite limited unfortunately so it's a pain to work with it
2010-12-23T04:40:00.000Z	sam-_-	psionicsin	never bothered to rly. understand it
2010-12-23T04:40:00.000Z	psionicsin	sam-_-	...I have no idea what these commands are that you all are spitting out.
2010-12-23T04:40:00.000Z	sam-_-	psionicsin	but you can look in /dev/sdX  /dev/hdX if your cdrom is there
2010-12-23T04:42:00.000Z	sam-_-	psionicsin	<Random832> sam-_-: it'd be /dev/srX not sdX
2010-12-23T04:42:00.000Z	sam-_-	psionicsin	you may want to read the man pages then: http://linuxmanpages.com/man8/dmesg.8.php
