2009-11-01T22:03:00.000Z	unr3a1	TechieWolf	if the resolution of the installer is too high, then try the alternate install cd

2009-11-01T22:05:00.000Z	TechieWolf		i want to have a GUI
2009-11-01T22:05:00.000Z	unr3a1	TechieWolf	but if the resolution of that gui is too high for your monitor, you do not have much choice
2009-11-01T22:05:00.000Z	TechieWolf		hmm, gonna try finding it
2009-11-01T22:06:00.000Z	TechieWolf	IndyGunFreak	can't find it
2009-11-01T22:06:00.000Z	TechieWolf		i want to be able to see the install
2009-11-01T22:07:00.000Z	unr3a1	TechieWolf	you will.  the only difference between the alternate cd install and the regular, is that the alternate does not have all the pretty graphics.  It is still essentially the same gui, but it is text based on a lower resolution.  thats it
2009-11-01T22:08:00.000Z	unr3a1	TechieWolf	you will be able to see the installation.
