2008-06-06T19:28:00.000Z	mangojambo		Hi there! I'm trying to install hardy (ubuntu 32 or 64 or ubuntustudio), but the cd freeze in a Busybox (initramfs) screen!! ... I'd try almost all solutions I found on web, acpi=off, floppy=off, all_generic_ide, enable floppy support on bios, etc ... none help me! I have an Asus AV8-MX. Please, did someone had the same problem? Or knows how to help me?

2008-06-06T19:30:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	mangojambo	 At start or install press F6 and remove Quiet and Splash from the command line. If it still fails.. Repeat and after removing quiet and splash add noapic acpi=off before the "--"

2008-06-06T19:31:00.000Z	mangojambo	Jack_Sparrow	I tried alternate too... :(
2008-06-06T19:31:00.000Z	mangojambo	Jack_Sparrow	the cd works fine in the other computer! Not in the mainly one ...
2008-06-09T17:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	mangojambo	What motherboard? Some need the bios set to ide compatibility mode
2008-06-09T17:36:00.000Z	mangojambo	Jack_Sparrow	is an Asus A8V-MX (rubbish)
2008-06-09T17:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	mangojambo	See if you have a bios option
2008-06-09T17:39:00.000Z	mangojambo	Jack_Sparrow	well .. I'd see there one thing: in the hard drivers information there is 4 more IDE HD (satas), but I dont remember if I saw a place to configure that ...
2008-06-09T17:40:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	mangojambo	look hard, I am alomst sure there is
2008-06-09T17:40:00.000Z	mangojambo	Jack_Sparrow	other thing is the sata was disable when I'd install hardy (I had a lot problems with initramfs)
2008-06-09T17:40:00.000Z	mangojambo	Jack_Sparrow	ok .. I will ... back in a minute ...
2008-06-09T18:03:00.000Z	mangojambo	Jack_Sparrow	that is my bios: http://img529.imageshack.us/img529/1602/dscn4025sp7.jpg  ...  http://img529.imageshack.us/img529/3581/dscn4026jg7.jpg ...  http://img529.imageshack.us/img529/9955/dscn4028gc2.jpg
2008-06-09T18:04:00.000Z	mangojambo	Jack_Sparrow	there is no other place showing about sata ...
2008-06-09T18:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	mangojambo	I dont have an answer for that
2008-06-09T18:09:00.000Z	mangojambo	Jack_Sparrow	looks like the bios set it automaticaly
2008-06-09T18:10:00.000Z	mangojambo	Jack_Sparrow	well, I'm doing the update right now ... there is a initramfs-tool package on that update ... I hope that fix my problem!! :/
2008-06-09T18:32:00.000Z	mangojambo	Jack_Sparrow	someone told me to try to capture on sata HD (and that is why I changed from usb), but I think it will not makes it better ... I mean, I really don't know!!
2008-06-09T18:43:00.000Z	mangojambo	Jack_Sparrow	what is AHCI ?  (on bios sata option)
2008-06-09T18:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	mangojambo	advanced host controller iterface..
