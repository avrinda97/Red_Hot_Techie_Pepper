2008-11-14T02:53:00.000Z	digitalice		:(
2008-11-14T02:53:00.000Z	bazhang	digitalice	did you md5 the iso
2008-11-14T02:53:00.000Z	bazhang	digitalice	also burn at very low speed and do the disk integrity check
2008-11-14T02:54:00.000Z	bazhang	digitalice	md5 is nothing about the cd
2008-11-14T02:54:00.000Z	bazhang	digitalice	dont guess; verify
2008-11-14T02:56:00.000Z	bazhang	digitalice	how much ram and did you try any boot params to the kernel
2008-11-14T16:23:00.000Z	bazhang	digitalice	did you reburn the iso to disk at low speed and then do the disk integrity check?
2008-11-14T16:24:00.000Z	bazhang	digitalice	lets keep this in channel please
2008-11-14T16:25:00.000Z	bazhang	digitalice	what happened when you did the disk integrity check
2008-11-14T16:25:00.000Z	bazhang	digitalice	what was the exact behaviour of the disk integrity check
2008-11-14T16:30:00.000Z	bazhang	digitalice	did you use this disk to install before? is this a fresh install or an upgrade to a new version; have you tried the alternate cd, as it will do well when the livecd chokes
2008-11-14T17:11:00.000Z	bazhang	digitalice	hi
2008-11-14T17:15:00.000Z	bazhang	digitalice	I would try the alternate cd at this point
2008-11-14T17:17:00.000Z	bazhang	digitalice	please keep this in channel
2008-11-14T17:17:00.000Z	bazhang	digitalice	try the alternate cd and see if that fixes it
