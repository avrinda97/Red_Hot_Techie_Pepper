2005-03-10T10:51:00.000Z	universal		hey, does someone know how if there is a difference in performance between using the nvidia.com grapic-drivers or the integrated nvidiadriver that comes with ubuntu??
2005-03-10T10:53:00.000Z	universal		has someone tried to install the nvidia.com grapic-driver in ubuntu?
2005-03-10T10:55:00.000Z	universal		has someone tried to install the nvidia.com grapic-driver in ubuntu?
2005-03-10T10:55:00.000Z	Welly	universal	yes.. had no problem with it
2005-03-10T10:56:00.000Z	universal	Welly	ok, so is there a difference between using the www.nvidia.com drivers and the integrated drivers coming from ubuntu?
2005-03-10T10:57:00.000Z	Welly		i'm not really sure but i presume so
2005-03-10T10:57:00.000Z	Welly		i just followed the howto on installing nvidia drivers
2005-03-10T10:58:00.000Z	universal	Welly	ok so you have actually done the things as configurating the kernel-headers and so...?
2005-03-10T10:58:00.000Z	Welly		not sure whether the nvidia driver coming from the nvidia site is any more recent or improved but the one i tried from ubuntu worked fine
2005-03-10T10:58:00.000Z	Welly	universal	no.. nothing like that
2005-03-10T10:59:00.000Z	universal	Welly	you just installed the glx-drivers? and nothing more?
2005-03-10T10:59:00.000Z	Welly		yeah, i think so
2005-03-10T11:00:00.000Z	universal	Welly	its just like that i have problems playing games using Cedega.... my gforce6800gt is pretty slow...
2005-03-10T11:00:00.000Z	Welly		oh right.. i've got a tnt2-m64 :) anything is goign to be slow
2005-03-10T11:00:00.000Z	Welly		apart from possibly asteroids
2005-03-10T11:02:00.000Z	universal	Welly	hmm, i think it has something to do with The Cedega program which cannot emulate things good enough-...
2005-03-10T11:02:00.000Z	Welly		i dont 'know what cedega is.. sorry
2005-03-10T11:03:00.000Z	universal	Welly	ok, its just a program which makes you accesible to Games
2005-03-10T11:04:00.000Z	Welly		oh ok! i don't really play games on the pc, hence the ati tnt2 :)
2005-03-10T11:04:00.000Z	Welly		i've got my xbox for video games
2005-03-10T11:05:00.000Z	universal	Welly	i understand Linux is also not the best distribution for playing games ;)
