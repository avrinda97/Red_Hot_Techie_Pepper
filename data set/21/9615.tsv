2005-09-01T15:34:00.000Z	uthini		my dl's are failing in synaptic
2005-09-01T15:34:00.000Z	uthini		and core stuff like the linux imiage
2005-09-01T15:34:00.000Z	uthini		kernel image even
2005-09-01T15:35:00.000Z	HappyFool	uthini	what error message do you get?
2005-09-01T15:36:00.000Z	HappyFool	uthini	and if you run from the command-line? e.g., 'sudo aptitude upgrade' ?
2005-09-01T15:39:00.000Z	uthini	HappyFool	a slightly more critical issue tho, i dl'ed and installed the kernel source so that i could compile my sound driver, but there is no version.h do i now need to configure this kernel source?
2005-09-01T15:40:00.000Z	HappyFool	uthini	the wiki page has a kernel compile howto
2005-09-01T15:40:00.000Z	uthini	HappyFool	i don't wanna compile the kernel tho, i just wanna get sound drivers
2005-09-01T15:40:00.000Z	HappyFool	uthini	oh, in that case you need linux-headers-386
2005-09-01T15:41:00.000Z	HappyFool	uthini	or maybe -k7 or -<something else>
2005-09-01T15:41:00.000Z	uthini	HappyFool	it makes sense that i need linux headers :)
2005-09-01T15:42:00.000Z	HappyFool	uthini	that package has a version.h; it may be what you want
2005-09-01T15:43:00.000Z	HappyFool	uthini	i'm not sure; not too big (nothing like linux-source)
2005-09-01T15:44:00.000Z	HappyFool	uthini	sorry, i'm not sure about that either. apt-get does resume, afaik
2005-09-01T15:54:00.000Z	uthini	HappyFool	so once i have the kernel headers i should be able to comple? will i need kernel dev?
2005-09-01T15:54:00.000Z	HappyFool	uthini	you'll need build-essential, probably
2005-09-01T15:55:00.000Z	HappyFool	uthini	linux-headers is on the CD, fwiw (possibly not the latest version); build-essential is also on the CD
