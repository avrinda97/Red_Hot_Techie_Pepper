2010-07-16T19:07:00.000Z	josephseraos		Hi everybody. I'm looking for where I could find my friends on XChat. Could you help me?
2010-07-16T19:08:00.000Z	red2kic	josephseraos	We're your friends.
2010-07-16T19:11:00.000Z	red2kic	josephseraos	I think you should see it in #ubuntu when you log in?  "Notify: $USER is online (FreeNode) ?
2010-07-16T19:12:00.000Z	josephseraos	red2kic	I'm new on irc
2010-07-16T19:13:00.000Z	red2kic	josephseraos	xchat? Generally we don't keep a list of friends. We just get along with whatever is going on with the channel. I mean, some people come in here once or twice and that's it. The regulars will be here often.
2010-07-16T19:16:00.000Z	josephseraos	red2kic	is "Notify: $USER is online (FreeNode)" a command?
2010-07-16T19:16:00.000Z	red2kic	josephseraos	Well -- I added you and it displayed that right away. I'm assuming it'll display that when you already added friends and joined the channel/server.
2010-07-16T19:17:00.000Z	josephseraos	red2kic	ok. I think I understood you
2010-07-16T19:27:00.000Z	red2kic	josephseraos	Try typing red then use your tab key.

2010-07-16T19:30:00.000Z	red2kic	josephseraos	You mean the red highlight? It allows people to see your message easily. That way you don't miss anything.
2010-07-16T19:31:00.000Z	josephseraos	red2kic	When I write now, is it red highlight?
2010-07-16T19:31:00.000Z	red2kic	josephseraos	Yes, for me. It is.
