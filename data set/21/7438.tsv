2006-09-29T16:01:00.000Z	JacksLivr		hello all.... Question. If i installed ubuntu and wish I had installed kubuntu... do i need to start over? or can i fix this by uninstalling gnome and installing KDE?
2006-09-29T16:02:00.000Z	SeanTater	JacksLivr	you can uninstall gnome and install kde
2006-09-29T16:03:00.000Z	SeanTater	JacksLivr	installing kde and keeping gnome is easier though
2006-09-29T16:03:00.000Z	SeanTater	JacksLivr	install kubuntu-desktop
2006-09-29T16:03:00.000Z	JacksLivr		and that will acomplish the same thing as if i had used kubuntu?
2006-09-29T16:03:00.000Z	SeanTater	JacksLivr	yes
2006-09-29T16:03:00.000Z	SeanTater	JacksLivr	for even closer to the same thing, also install kdm
2006-09-29T16:04:00.000Z	JacksLivr	SeanTater	why keep gnome?
2006-09-29T16:04:00.000Z	SeanTater	JacksLivr	but it;s difficult to remove
2006-09-29T16:04:00.000Z	SeanTater	JacksLivr	/because it's difficult/
2006-09-29T16:05:00.000Z	JacksLivr	SeanTater	ok, how much space am i using with it?
2006-09-29T16:05:00.000Z	SeanTater	JacksLivr	probably not more than 300 MB
2006-09-29T16:06:00.000Z	SeanTater	JacksLivr	But if you do reinstsll and use kubuntu from scratch, DON'T FORGET TO BACKUP
2006-09-29T16:07:00.000Z	JacksLivr	SeanTater	is just installed ubuntu last night
2006-09-29T16:07:00.000Z	SeanTater	JacksLivr	good
2006-09-29T16:07:00.000Z	JacksLivr		as long as it leaves my other partitions alone, ill be fine
2006-09-29T16:07:00.000Z	SeanTater	JacksLivr	If you change distros often, you may want to have a data partition
2006-09-29T16:08:00.000Z	SeanTater	JacksLivr	um-
2006-09-29T16:08:00.000Z	SeanTater	JacksLivr	I missed the above
2006-09-29T16:09:00.000Z	JacksLivr	SeanTater	I had a laptop with xp on it and one big partition. i resized it last night and made a 10GB for ubuntu and a 25 fat32 for data. the Xp still works fine.
2006-09-29T16:09:00.000Z	SeanTater	JacksLivr	I keep 2 partitions for os's and one for data so I can (re)install whenever I like
