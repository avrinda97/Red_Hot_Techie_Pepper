2007-10-29T01:02:00.000Z	naxa		hi! ok folks, everything keeps crashing. fresh 7.10 install. I just installed to a newly formatted partition. no hdd error. no cpu error. no memory error. what is this? even terminal crashed. I lastly thought it could be the video driver somehow and changed the driver vesa. the X went black and linux _freezed_ it didn't take in ctrl-alt-del or backspace... can anyone try and help me here maybe?
2007-10-29T01:04:00.000Z	naxa		please anyone help me!
2007-10-29T01:06:00.000Z	Slart	naxa	can you run memtest for an hour so without crashing?
2007-10-29T01:06:00.000Z	naxa	Slart	yes I do. I didn't wait the whole memtest thing but I think I've waited 1-2 hours at least.
2007-10-29T01:06:00.000Z	Slart	naxa	from your description I would guess memory problems.. could be overheating too
2007-10-29T01:06:00.000Z	naxa	Slart	I have 1 gb ram and a 2 GHz + cpu
2007-10-29T01:07:00.000Z	naxa	Slart	7.04 worked fine for weeks and after that i updated
2007-10-29T01:07:00.000Z	Slart	naxa	so everything crashes? any messages in syslog? (tail /var/log/syslog) ?
2007-10-29T01:07:00.000Z	naxa	Slart	sensors shows my cpu is 25 C
2007-10-29T01:07:00.000Z	Slart	naxa	25C sounds very very low.. almost broken low =)
2007-10-29T01:08:00.000Z	naxa	Slart	it's for amd, for intel it would be 45 C
2007-10-29T01:08:00.000Z	naxa	Slart	anyway no errors in tail of syslog
2007-10-29T01:08:00.000Z	naxa	Slart	it's not crashing always... it's only sometimes
2007-10-29T01:08:00.000Z	Slart	naxa	not when you run some specific software?
2007-10-29T01:09:00.000Z	naxa	Slart	not. everything crashes and not always but randomly.
2007-10-29T01:09:00.000Z	naxa	Slart	but for example xchat-gnome _always_ crashes and pidgin seems to crash much more than firefox... 20 to 1
2007-10-29T01:09:00.000Z	Slart	naxa	hmm.. very strange.. so.. it isn't memory.. it isn't overheating.. disc failing slowly?
2007-10-29T01:10:00.000Z	naxa	Slart	my hdd should be ok, and I tryied different partitions too
2007-10-29T01:11:00.000Z	Slart	naxa	I'm out of solutions then.. if there are no errors logged and no pattern in what software crashes it might as well be aliens...
2007-10-29T01:11:00.000Z	naxa	Slart	I thought it's maybe my savage4 video card somehow... i changed the driver to vesa and all went blank... linux simply died. what could this be?
2007-12-12T05:21:00.000Z	Slart	naxa	there are a couple of chassgames available.. look at eboard for example
