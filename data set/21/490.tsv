2011-11-18T08:44:00.000Z	Matisse		if i have a normal stereo mp3 or wave file, how will the playback sound on a correct X.1 system? Do I only hear something on left and right or also on subwoofer or the other ones?
2011-11-18T08:45:00.000Z	brjannc	Matisse	that really depends on your crossover :)
2011-11-18T08:46:00.000Z	Matisse	brjannc	what would be the correct version? gods 5.1 e.g. :)
2011-11-18T08:48:00.000Z	brjannc	Matisse	Well, what I'm saying is that it's more-or-less hardware (e.g. your amplifier) dependent, and I don't think OS sound settings affect it -- I could be wrong there though
2011-11-18T08:48:00.000Z	brjannc	Matisse	to be clear, by hardware amplifier, I mean the amp connected to your speakers -- not your computer's hardware
2011-11-18T08:50:00.000Z	Matisse	brjannc	is there no correct way to attach?
2011-11-18T08:51:00.000Z	Matisse	brjannc	but, actually, Im not interested in the sound. Which signals does the computer send? Left, right, and something else?
2011-11-18T08:52:00.000Z	brjannc	Matisse	depends on your computer's outputs. some have multiple outputs for multiple channels, others have just stereo output, and relies on the amplifier to route the sounds to the right places. but we're getting a bit beyond the scope of #ubuntu :)
2011-11-18T08:53:00.000Z	Matisse	brjannc	so, then what would the software output be if there are enough outputs on the computer
2011-11-18T08:54:00.000Z	Matisse	brjannc	it is a pre-question because i need to decide if I can go back to alsa without loosing my multichannel functionality
2011-11-18T08:55:00.000Z	brjannc	Matisse	well, for example, the laptop i'm on now has digital stereo and analog stereo outputs; under the pulseaudio sound preferences, i can select e.g. "analog duplex output" or "analog input, digital output" etc.
2011-11-18T08:56:00.000Z	brjannc	Matisse	I would guess that cards with multi-channel output would have multi-channel options. however, I think what you're asking is, can 2 channel stereo carry multi-channel (e.g. 5.1, 7.1 surround) signals? the answer is yes, because the amplifier decodes it
2011-11-18T09:02:00.000Z	Matisse	brjannc	can you give me a hint for finding the right pulse config? I have 5 outputs on my computer, 3 stereo cables leading from there to the 5.1 amp.  the former 5.1 settings didnt give a subwoofer signal, thats why attach the center channel to the sufwoofer...
2011-11-18T09:03:00.000Z	Matisse	brjannc	now I'm playing around with pavumeter and pavucontrol, but I've got no idea expect choosing and reconnecting till I find something
2011-11-18T09:03:00.000Z	brjannc	Matisse	I don't know that I'd be much more help than poking and praying, I'm afraid :\
2011-11-18T09:04:00.000Z	Matisse	brjannc	da... at least you pushed me in the right direction, thx for that :9
2011-11-18T09:04:00.000Z	Matisse		:)
2011-11-18T09:05:00.000Z	brjannc	Matisse	Sure thing :) This guide *might* help you out: http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Using_ALSA%27s_speaker-test_utility
2011-11-18T09:05:00.000Z	brjannc	Matisse	(It's a mythtv guide, but mythtv is based on ubuntu, so there should be a lot of similarities)
2011-11-18T09:06:00.000Z	brjannc	Matisse	well, mythbuntu is, i mean
