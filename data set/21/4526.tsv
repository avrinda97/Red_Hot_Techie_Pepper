2009-01-03T08:18:00.000Z	TeamColtra[NADC]		Now I have another question for you guys that maybe you will give some other tips that might help me... I am getting rid of windows entirely.... and I would love to be able to just erase the partition and expand this one over it... would that be possible without having to start all over in ubuntu
2009-01-03T08:18:00.000Z	TeamColtra[NADC]		?
2009-01-03T08:18:00.000Z	wj32	TeamColtra[NADC]	you can install gparted
2009-01-03T08:18:00.000Z	wj32	TeamColtra[NADC]	sudo apt-get install gparted
2009-01-03T08:19:00.000Z	TeamColtra[NADC]	wj32	That will allow me to just expand the size of this partition without having to worry about making it unstable?
2009-01-03T08:19:00.000Z	wj32	TeamColtra[NADC]	yep
2009-01-03T08:19:00.000Z	wj32	TeamColtra[NADC]	im assuming you're using ext3
2009-01-03T08:20:00.000Z	wj32	TeamColtra[NADC]	actually, you need to get the gparted livcd
2009-01-03T08:20:00.000Z	wj32	TeamColtra[NADC]	*livecd. you can't resize your linux partition live, unless its xfs or something

2009-01-03T08:27:00.000Z	wj32	TeamColtra[NADC]	do you mean you can't download the ISO?
2009-01-03T08:27:00.000Z	wj32	TeamColtra[NADC]	try clearing your APT cache
2009-01-03T08:27:00.000Z	TeamColtra[NADC]	wj32	and how would I do that?
2009-01-03T08:28:00.000Z	wj32	TeamColtra[NADC]	no idea
2009-01-03T08:28:00.000Z	wj32	TeamColtra[NADC]	oh wait
2009-01-03T08:28:00.000Z	wj32	TeamColtra[NADC]	open synaptic package manager
2009-01-03T08:29:00.000Z	wj32	TeamColtra[NADC]	Settings > Preferences > Delete Cached Package Files
2009-01-03T08:29:00.000Z	wj32	TeamColtra[NADC]	oops i meant Settings > Preferences > Files > Delete Cached Package Files
2009-01-03T08:29:00.000Z	wj32	TeamColtra[NADC]	thats bad.
2009-01-03T08:30:00.000Z	wj32	TeamColtra[NADC]	have you been running GUI apps using sudo?
