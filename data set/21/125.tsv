2012-11-23T19:38:00.000Z	opieng		hi all, I have tried google chrome on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and still can not get Youtube video to play, it says "missing plugin"
2012-11-23T19:39:00.000Z	opieng		can anyone help?
2012-11-23T19:40:00.000Z	opieng		I thought someone mentioned last time to go for Chrome, not chromium as chromium does not have the right plugins for this
2012-11-23T19:41:00.000Z	opieng		oh, ok I will give it a try then, both chrome and firefox both do not work for me
2012-11-23T19:41:00.000Z	vlt	opieng	I tried for weeks to get it working. Then someone told me that the latest Flash included in Chrome doesn’t support my CPU (or vice versa).
2012-11-23T19:41:00.000Z	opieng		For which browser theadmin ?
2012-11-23T19:42:00.000Z	opieng	vlt	ahh I might have the same problem my CPU is very old
2012-11-23T19:43:00.000Z	vlt	opieng	Mine is an AMD Athlon XP 2000 and doesn’t know some SSEEESSEEESEESEEEEEE… stuff
2012-11-23T19:43:00.000Z	opieng		lol same processor as mine but I think mine is the 2300
2012-11-23T19:44:00.000Z	vlt	opieng	Ok, then it really might be the same problem.
2012-11-23T19:44:00.000Z	opieng		so would sudo apt-get install adobe-flashplugin still work for me?
2012-11-23T19:45:00.000Z	opieng		sorry will do I am not at that system at the moment adknight87
2012-11-23T19:45:00.000Z	vlt	opieng	This installs the last Flash version from Adobe that supports linux. Some Flash websites might not work.
2012-11-23T19:46:00.000Z	vlt	opieng	(Adobe dropped linux after Flash 10.2)
2012-11-23T19:46:00.000Z	opieng	vlt	oh!
2012-11-23T19:47:00.000Z	opieng	vlt	so what did you do to get youtube working?
2012-11-23T19:47:00.000Z	opieng		as sounds like I might have the same problem as you
2012-11-23T19:47:00.000Z	vlt	opieng	I use HTML5.
2012-11-23T19:48:00.000Z	opieng	vlt	never used that
2012-11-23T19:48:00.000Z	vlt		youtube.com/html5
2012-11-23T19:49:00.000Z	vlt	opieng	^
