2008-03-19T10:04:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	JbCrash	the best way to insure you don't lose anythijng is to back everything up.. the chances of losing something is slim, but if you start getting wreckless, you'll have a problem
2008-03-19T10:04:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	JbCrash	that version of ubuntu is extremely old, you're going to run into problems installing it... closed repositories, etc...
2008-03-19T10:04:00.000Z	JbCrash	IndyGunFreak	yes..me doing backup now before insert ubuntu cd
2008-03-19T10:04:00.000Z	JbCrash	IndyGunFreak	any other way to install new version?
2008-03-19T10:05:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	JbCrash	well thast good... but i would not install 5.04
2008-03-19T10:05:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	JbCrash	download a current iso?
2008-03-19T10:05:00.000Z	JbCrash	IndyGunFreak	i confused in that iso matter..its i can use live cd..and install manually from net?
2008-03-19T10:06:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	JbCrash	yes.. if you download a regular ISO, the yes, it will run from the Live CD, and also allow you to install.
2008-03-19T10:06:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	JbCrash	just a suggestion to, i would suggest sticking w/ i386 also.
2008-03-19T10:11:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	JbCrash	check the wine database
2008-03-19T10:12:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	JbCrash	i would be more concerned about using a current version of ubuntu
2008-03-19T10:12:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	JbCrash	you're going to run into a shitload of problems
2008-03-19T10:12:00.000Z	JbCrash	IndyGunFreak	i will updates my ubuntu
2008-03-19T10:12:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	JbCrash	i'm not talking about updating
2008-03-19T10:13:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	JbCrash	you need to download a current iso and reburn
2008-03-19T10:13:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	JbCrash	you'll fail in the updating process,b ecause of closed repositories
2008-03-19T10:13:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	JbCrash	700mb i do believe, do the math
