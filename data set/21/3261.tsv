2009-02-13T06:56:00.000Z	mcstinky		good evening everyone, anyone here strong in wine, and being good with netbook remix is a plus too =p
2009-02-13T06:56:00.000Z	leo_rockway	mcstinky	it's usually a good idea to just ask your question
2009-02-13T06:56:00.000Z	mcstinky	leo_rockway	ah right okay
2009-02-13T06:57:00.000Z	leo_rockway	mcstinky	then if someone can help you they will
2009-02-13T06:57:00.000Z	mcstinky		well I'm in the status of completely elimitating windows, and I'm trying to get warcraft 3 working, I've installed through wine, but it crashes upon opening the game itself, and I get a black screen during the intro
2009-02-13T06:59:00.000Z	leo_rockway	mcstinky	if you didn't do it yet, you should check this: http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=1177
2009-02-13T07:06:00.000Z	mcstinky	leo_rockway	thanks, that actually helped some =D I got into the game, but it's extremely laggy... could it be graphics driver issues?
2009-02-13T07:07:00.000Z	leo_rockway	mcstinky	could be. Depends on your drivers too. Try disabling compiz if you are using it...
2009-02-13T07:07:00.000Z	mcstinky		I read somewhere that ubuntu has a native driver for the GMA 950 mobile graphics chip, is this true, or will I need to install a new graphics driver?
2009-02-13T07:07:00.000Z	leo_rockway	mcstinky	Intel has free graphics included in the installation.

2009-02-13T07:08:00.000Z	mcstinky	leo_rockway	ah right.. okay so it is not a driver issue then I can gather
2009-02-13T07:09:00.000Z	leo_rockway	mcstinky	it could be a driver issue. You most likely need nonfree drivers.
2009-02-13T07:09:00.000Z	leo_rockway	mcstinky	unless you have Intel.
2009-02-13T07:10:00.000Z	mcstinky	leo_rockway	my lspci lists a intel 945GM/GMS as VGA
2009-02-13T07:11:00.000Z	leo_rockway	mcstinky	then I don't know where the problem could be.
2009-02-13T07:12:00.000Z	mcstinky	leo_rockway	you've been a great help so far, I got in to the game, so thank you for that =D I'm still reading the page for some fixes etc, maybe something else there fixes my problem
2009-02-13T07:13:00.000Z	leo_rockway	mcstinky	if you can't fix the problem leave a comment in that page and maybe someone else can tell you what's going on. I rarely use WINE and I never played any games with it, so unfortunately that's as much as I can help you.
2009-02-13T07:15:00.000Z	mcstinky	leo_rockway	I don't plan on doing much gaming either, but I'm surprised how well it handles windows applications, I'm thinking about trying office
2009-02-13T07:17:00.000Z	leo_rockway	mcstinky	I heard Crossover Office works perfectly, but it's not free as in beer.
2009-02-13T07:18:00.000Z	leo_rockway	mcstinky	Crossover Office is pretty much a WINE modified to work seamless with MS Office
