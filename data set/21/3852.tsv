2008-09-07T15:15:00.000Z	NWM		Ubuntu does not detect my harddrive, "sudo fdisk -l" shows nothing, how can I install?
2008-09-07T15:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	NWM	which controller is it attached to? can you see it on boot messages (dmesg) ?
2008-09-07T15:18:00.000Z	NWM	erUSUL	how would I find those things out?
2008-09-07T15:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	NWM	"dmesg | less" to see kernel boot up msgs. "lspci" shows the controllers cards on the computer you can paste it on paste.ubuntu.com
2008-09-07T15:21:00.000Z	NWM	erUSUL	I am using the CTRL-ALT-F2 terminal, so I cant paste, but lscpi mentions "SATA IDE Controllers"
2008-09-07T15:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	NWM	use pastebinit like shey said
2008-09-07T15:22:00.000Z	NWM	erUSUL	it couldnt find the package
2008-09-07T15:22:00.000Z	NWM	erUSUL	running off of the LiveCD atm
2008-09-07T15:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	NWM	:| which kind of ide controler? intel; sis; via etc...
2008-09-07T15:23:00.000Z	NWM	erUSUL	intel
2008-09-07T15:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	NWM	did you look into dmesg output? intel controllers are well supported
2008-09-07T15:24:00.000Z	NWM	erUSUL	running in command-line atm, the output is longer than the screen, nothing that I can see says anything relevant though
2008-09-07T15:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	NWM	thats what pagers were programmed for use "dmesg | less" and use spc bar to move
2008-09-07T15:27:00.000Z	NWM	erUSUL	there are a few mentions of ata and scsi, what should I be looking for?
2008-09-07T15:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	NWM	if the controller is intel somehing like ata_piix or ahci (lines beggining with)
2008-09-07T15:33:00.000Z	NWM	erUSUL	there doesnt seem to be any mention of my hdd, it does mention my cdrom though
2008-09-07T15:33:00.000Z	NWM	erUSUL	the cdrom is connected to the older drive-connection (I forgot name, the one with the wide cables)
2008-09-07T15:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	NWM	ParalelATA vs SerialATA :). well i would recommend to check the bios and puth the sata controller in ahci mode if you can
2008-09-07T15:39:00.000Z	NWM	erUSUL	its an option has an option for AHCI, its currently set to disabled, Is their any risk to the data on that drive by changing the setting?
2008-09-07T15:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	NWM	no; just changes the mode the sata controller is used by the drivers
2008-09-07T15:49:00.000Z	NWM	erUSUL	its working now, thank you
