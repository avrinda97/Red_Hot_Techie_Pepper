2005-09-27T14:31:00.000Z	shtron		anyone knows if there is a way to create a list of the packages I have installed so I can diff them after upgrade?
2005-09-27T14:31:00.000Z	shtron		thanks
2005-09-27T06:34:00.000Z	shtron		I just changed my sources.list to breezy sources and went apt-get update; apt-get dist-upgrade. it finished download all the packeges and now its selecting and unpacking them. while it does, I see all sorts of error messages like unable to delete directory or stuff about the locals. should I be worried? Where can I see a log of those errors later?
2005-09-27T06:34:00.000Z	Seveas	shtron	no you should not be worried
2005-09-27T06:44:00.000Z	Seveas	shtron	2.6.12
2005-09-27T07:33:00.000Z	Seveas	shtron	make sure your interface is set to auto and dhcp in the interfaces file
2005-09-27T07:35:00.000Z	Seveas	shtron	/etc/network/interfaces
2005-09-27T08:15:00.000Z	Seveas	shtron	blacklist 8139too and add 8139cp to /etc/modules
2005-09-27T08:16:00.000Z	Seveas	shtron	/etc/hotplug/blacklist
2005-11-20T15:11:00.000Z	Seveas	shtron	install the build-essential package
2005-11-20T15:13:00.000Z	Seveas	shtron	no
2005-11-20T15:15:00.000Z	Seveas	shtron	don't do that
2005-11-20T06:53:00.000Z	shtron	Seveas	Earlier you told me not to only compile kernel the way ubuntu wiki explain. what's wrong with the old fashion way? if I need 2.6.14, can I use apt-get to get the source and then patch it from kernel.org?
2005-11-20T06:53:00.000Z	Seveas	shtron	why do you need 2.6.14?
2005-11-20T06:55:00.000Z	shtron	Seveas	cause I have an operation systems project from my university and it was decided that that's the kernel version we'll use...
2005-11-20T06:55:00.000Z	Seveas	shtron	right...
2005-11-20T06:56:00.000Z	shtron	Seveas	so will patching cause trouble?
2005-11-20T07:02:00.000Z	shtron	Seveas	I didn't understand that answer: "right...". do you think I'm kidding you?
2005-11-20T07:03:00.000Z	Seveas	shtron	no
2005-11-20T07:06:00.000Z	shtron	Seveas	oh... well, it's not a requirement, we're a group of 3 students and we were told to pick what we want. any erason why not to use .14?
2005-11-20T07:06:00.000Z	Seveas	shtron	ubing a standard kernel is easier :)
