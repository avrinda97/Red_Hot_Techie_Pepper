2012-11-29T07:11:00.000Z	hrolf		Hi #ubuntu, my touchpad has apparently stopped working, what should I do?
2012-11-29T07:12:00.000Z	hrolf		Was working fine till yesterday and suddenly now it is not working
2012-11-29T07:13:00.000Z	Shiven	hrolf	have you determined if its actually working?
2012-11-29T07:13:00.000Z	Shiven	hrolf	try loading the livecd and see if it works there
2012-11-29T07:14:00.000Z	hrolf	Shiven	It was working fine till yesterday, now I bootup and it is suddenly not working
2012-11-29T07:15:00.000Z	hrolf	Shiven	Yesterday it stopped working then I exec the commands "modprobe -r psmouse" and "modprobe psmouse proto=imps"
2012-11-29T07:16:00.000Z	Shiven	hrolf	i'd start by checking it wasn't physically damaged (ie livecd) just so you don't go down the (frustrating) path of hacking up an xconfig to find its dead. Whilst it sounds like its just intermittant, its to save time long term :)
2012-11-29T07:18:00.000Z	hrolf	Shiven	is it necessasry that I check with LiveCD, how about I test it and see if it is working in Windows?
2012-11-29T07:18:00.000Z	Shiven	hrolf	also works, i don't have windows so livecd was first thought :p
2012-11-29T07:19:00.000Z	hrolf	Shiven	Alright, thanks, let me reboot.
2012-11-29T07:23:00.000Z	hrolf	Shiven	Back. Checked and it is working fine in Windows.
2012-11-29T07:24:00.000Z	hrolf	Shiven	Actually, it works fine until I login, after which it stops working.
2012-11-29T07:24:00.000Z	hrolf	Shiven	It was moving in the login screen but as soon I logged in, it stops..
2012-11-29T07:24:00.000Z	Shiven	hrolf	drop back to console, and install gpm. see if its working in console
2012-11-29T07:24:00.000Z	Shiven	hrolf	oh nvm i'll bet i know what it is
2012-11-29T07:25:00.000Z	Shiven	hrolf	you're using default unity / gnome2? or a kde variant?
2012-11-29T07:25:00.000Z	hrolf	Shiven	default unity
2012-11-29T07:27:00.000Z	hrolf	Shiven	xinput shows it has detected an ALPS DualPoint Touchpad
2012-11-29T07:27:00.000Z	Shiven	hrolf	check your private messages
2012-11-29T07:27:00.000Z	hrolf	Shiven	how?
2012-11-29T07:28:00.000Z	hrolf	Shiven	ops sorry
