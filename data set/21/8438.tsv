2006-04-18T16:52:00.000Z	CNAP		does anybody know where the "trash" is?
2006-04-18T16:52:00.000Z	CNAP		equivalent to the recycle bin?
2006-04-18T16:54:00.000Z	CNAP		nickgarvey: nope, not anywhere there
2006-04-18T05:17:00.000Z	CNAP		ok so without having to read the sudoers and visudo man pages, what exactly does it ido?
2006-04-18T05:17:00.000Z	kbrooks	CNAP	sudo:
2006-04-18T05:18:00.000Z	kbrooks	CNAP	uses the EDITOR variable, or the "editor" symlink, to open up the sudoers file
2006-04-18T05:19:00.000Z	kbrooks	CNAP	it copies the file to a temporary directory before the editor is opened
2006-04-18T05:20:00.000Z	kbrooks	CNAP	so that "visudo" will check the syntax of the file without... killing the sudoers file
2006-04-18T05:20:00.000Z	kbrooks	CNAP	and copy it if the syntax check has oassed
2006-04-18T05:20:00.000Z	kbrooks	CNAP	understand?
2006-04-18T05:20:00.000Z	CNAP	kbrooks	kind of. now my question is what does the sudoers file do?
2006-04-18T05:21:00.000Z	kbrooks	CNAP	what dont you understand?
2006-04-18T05:21:00.000Z	kbrooks	CNAP	the file does nothing by itself. its a sudo configuration file
2006-04-18T05:22:00.000Z	CNAP	kbrooks	i'm reading the MAN page right now and this is its description: The sudoers file is composed of two types of entries: aliases (basically variables) and user specifications (which specify who may run what).
2006-04-18T05:22:00.000Z	kbrooks	CNAP	Yes.
2006-04-18T05:23:00.000Z	kbrooks	CNAP	the stuff bout entries can be ignored
2006-04-18T05:23:00.000Z	CNAP	kbrooks	yes, i'm afraid i don't understand
2006-04-18T05:23:00.000Z	kbrooks	CNAP	WHAT don't you understand?
2006-04-18T05:24:00.000Z	CNAP	kbrooks	i'm sorry i'm frustrating you here -- but i don't know understand what the sudoers file actual DOES. what's it's purpose in life?
2006-04-18T05:25:00.000Z	kbrooks	CNAP	i'm not frustrated. i'd liker to help you
2006-04-18T05:25:00.000Z	kbrooks	CNAP	h/o
