2005-04-25T12:38:00.000Z	graabein		can anyone help me with my nvidia problems? i've posted the Xorg.conf here: http://pastebin.com/271287
2005-04-25T12:39:00.000Z	tritium	graabein	that's not your xorg.conf ;) (it's /var/log/Xorg.0.log)
2005-04-25T12:40:00.000Z	graabein	tritium	hehe, sorry, i meant the Xorg.0.log
2005-04-25T12:42:00.000Z	graabein	tritium	what do you reckon the problem is? i can't start x with the "nvidia" driver
2005-04-25T12:42:00.000Z	tritium	graabein	I'm looking it the log now.  Is that the whole thing?
2005-04-25T12:42:00.000Z	graabein	tritium	yep
2005-04-25T12:44:00.000Z	tritium	graabein	hard to say, particularly since you installed from nvidia's binaries, rather than ubuntu packages
2005-04-25T12:44:00.000Z	graabein	tritium	how do i remove the binaries?
2005-04-25T12:44:00.000Z	tritium	graabein	I've never used them, so I can't say
2005-04-25T12:45:00.000Z	graabein	tritium	how do i verify if open gl is running as it should?
2005-04-25T12:46:00.000Z	tritium	graabein	I'm not sure of the best way...
2005-04-25T12:52:00.000Z	graabein	tritium	or others, does this: (WW) NVIDIA(0): Bad V_BIOS checksum    cause a problem?
2005-04-25T12:52:00.000Z	tritium	graabein	it could, but at least that's just a warning
2005-04-25T12:53:00.000Z	graabein	tritium	x won't start with the nvidia-driver so the error must be in the xorg.0.log?
2005-04-25T12:54:00.000Z	tritium	graabein	it should be, yes
2005-04-26T13:02:00.000Z	tritium	graabein	you're not using the 7174 version nvidia drivers?
2005-04-26T13:02:00.000Z	graabein	tritium	no, i'm using 6629
2005-04-26T13:02:00.000Z	tritium	graabein	how come?
2005-04-26T13:03:00.000Z	graabein	tritium	i couldnt get glxinfo running at all... segmentation fault
2005-04-26T13:03:00.000Z	graabein	tritium	i tried reinstalling and removing, using ubuntu nvidia etc
2005-04-26T13:04:00.000Z	tritium	graabein	that's bizarre.  I remember from yesterday that you installed the nvidia biniaries instead of ubuntu packages.  Were you unable to uninstall them?
