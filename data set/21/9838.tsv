2005-08-24T06:43:00.000Z	hmrocha	bimberi	irssi? i live in the XXI century, i don't have a ZX Spectrum anymore
2005-08-24T06:43:00.000Z	bimberi	hmrocha	:)
2005-08-24T06:44:00.000Z	hmrocha	bimberi	i really don't understand why people keep using text apps
2005-08-24T06:45:00.000Z	bimberi	hmrocha	some people ssh into remote servers for irc
2005-08-24T06:46:00.000Z	hmrocha	bimberi	"normal" users don't
2005-08-24T06:46:00.000Z	bimberi	hmrocha	define "normal"
2005-08-24T06:46:00.000Z	hmrocha	bimberi	people not connected to computer science
2005-08-24T06:47:00.000Z	hmrocha	bimberi	maybe you mom, your father, that kind of people
2005-08-24T06:48:00.000Z	bimberi	hmrocha	but they're not in "the linux world" (going back to your original assertion)
2005-08-24T06:48:00.000Z	hmrocha	bimberi	that's why linux is still behind windows, because people keep separating the two worlds
2005-08-24T06:48:00.000Z	hmrocha	bimberi	"i use linux, i'm geek, you use windows, you're lame"
2005-08-24T06:48:00.000Z	hmrocha	bimberi	very typical expression
2005-08-24T06:49:00.000Z	bimberi	hmrocha	not for me it isn't (gawd talking to myself again :) )
2005-08-24T06:49:00.000Z	hmrocha	bimberi	i listen to a lot of people saying "if you use linux, you must use the shell, forget about graphical apps"
2005-08-24T06:50:00.000Z	bimberi	hmrocha	that has been true but i feel that ubuntu is a major leap in that regard
2005-08-24T06:51:00.000Z	hmrocha	bimberi	yes, that's why i use ubuntu and my mom thinks ubuntu is easier that windows
2005-08-24T06:51:00.000Z	hmrocha	bimberi	"...than windows"
2005-08-24T06:51:00.000Z	bimberi	hmrocha	fantastic
2005-08-24T06:52:00.000Z	hmrocha	bimberi	but i'm a computer science student so it doesn't matter if i use ubuntu or another distro
2005-08-24T06:53:00.000Z	bimberi	hmrocha	that's nice :)
