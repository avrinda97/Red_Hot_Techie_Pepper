2011-11-26T12:30:00.000Z	Zutara		How would I go about fixing "to be installed" & "is uninstallable" problems in 11.10?
2011-11-26T12:31:00.000Z	Scott_S	Zutara	Are you talkingabout in the Aptitude package manager?
2011-11-26T12:32:00.000Z	Scott_S	Zutara	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair
2011-11-26T12:34:00.000Z	Scott_S	Zutara	Out of curosity, what is the package(s) that your brother is trying to install?
2011-11-26T12:34:00.000Z	Zutara	Scott_S	scratch
2011-11-26T12:35:00.000Z	Zutara	Scott_S	It's made for Elementary but no one's ever in there.
2011-11-26T12:36:00.000Z	Scott_S	Zutara	Is this a fresh installation? If it isn't, you can try running "sudo apt-get update", then try scratch via 'apt-get install scratch'
2011-11-26T12:38:00.000Z	Zutara	Scott_S	it is a fresh installation. he added the PPA (it's still in the testing phases) and I told him to run the sudo update command, but wehn he tried to chek it for installation in Synaptic it gave him unsatisfiable errors.
2011-11-26T12:39:00.000Z	Scott_S	Zutara	the only thing I can think of is that it doesn't have the required dependencies, which would lead to it not being able to being installed. Generally though, Synaptic would auto-download those dependies... pretty weird.
2011-11-26T12:39:00.000Z	Scott_S	Zutara	give me a minute and I'll try to get it up and running on my VM and I'll get back to you.
2011-11-26T12:40:00.000Z	Zutara	Scott_S	ok
2011-11-26T12:41:00.000Z	Scott_S	Zutara	Have you attempted to use the 'apt-get install scratch' command after adding the ppa and using 'apt-get update'?
2011-11-26T12:44:00.000Z	Scott_S	Zutara	You would have to install those dependies before attempting the install. Just type 'apt-get install (package)'. It'll go one by one, but it should work after you've met them all.
2011-11-26T12:45:00.000Z	Zutara	Scott_S	some of the packages are installed but their the old versions. some of the others aren;t even in the elementary/oneiric repos either.
2011-11-26T13:07:00.000Z	Scott_S	Zutara	Scartch installation successful by using the .deb installer: https://launchpad.net/~scratch/+archive/ppa/+files/scratch_1.4.0.1-0ubuntu5_i386.deb
2011-11-26T13:18:00.000Z	Zutara	Scott_S	This is the Scratch EnigmaticEffigy was talking about: https://launchpad.net/scratch
2011-11-26T13:18:00.000Z	Scott_S	Zutara	This download should work for that: http://launchpad.net/scratch/1.0/1.0/+download/scratch_1.0-0~293~oneiric1_i386.deb
2011-11-26T13:20:00.000Z	Scott_S	Zutara	I got the same program from that. it appears they are the same thing.
2011-11-26T13:20:00.000Z	Scott_S	Zutara	Upon attempting to install, the .deb installer responded that there was a newer version already installed (I now have 1.5 installed)
2011-11-26T13:21:00.000Z	Zutara	Scott_S	The scratch he installed look more like a sprite editor than a Text Editor. Sorry if I'm sounding harsh.
2011-11-26T13:23:00.000Z	Scott_S	Zutara	I wish I could say they were different, but the package maintaner and everything matches up.
