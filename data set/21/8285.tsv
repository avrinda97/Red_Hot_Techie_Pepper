2006-05-12T16:26:00.000Z	hastesaver		"We try to be nice and help but don't like to see *such things*" ??? Does it mean we don't like to see nice and helpful things?
2006-05-12T05:13:00.000Z	hastesaver		BTW, does gnome still have that "feature" that lets us do "Delete this panel" and then we don't know how to get it back? :(
2006-05-12T05:14:00.000Z	gnomefreak	hastesaver	yes you can still delete a panel
2006-05-12T05:15:00.000Z	hastesaver	gnomefreak	isn't that a UI bug? It doesn't really tell us what exactly we are deleting... I got pretty screwed by that when I was new
2006-05-12T05:16:00.000Z	gnomefreak	hastesaver	right clicking it give you choice to delete this panel now if someone cant figure out what delete this panel is i would have to say its no longer a bug
2006-05-12T05:18:00.000Z	hastesaver	gnomefreak	I was trying to get rid of the notification area or something... I thought the app shortcut icons, the notification area, and the clock were all separate panels. What's the correct name for them?
2006-05-12T05:23:00.000Z	gnomefreak	hastesaver	i have something called notifacation area in my add to panel i cant remember if breezy has that
2006-05-18T12:59:00.000Z	gnomefreak	hastesaver	not true
2006-05-18T12:59:00.000Z	gnomefreak	hastesaver	what do you think gksu is?
2006-05-18T12:59:00.000Z	gnomefreak	hastesaver	no
2006-05-18T12:59:00.000Z	gnomefreak	hastesaver	sudo -i is not for gui sudo -s is iirc
2006-05-18T13:02:00.000Z	gnomefreak	hastesaver	open cups
2006-05-18T13:03:00.000Z	hastesaver	gnomefreak	just to be clear, I login to the root account with "ssh -X root@machinename". After this, running GUI apps is perfectly fine, right?
2006-05-18T13:04:00.000Z	gnomefreak	hastesaver	cups has nothing to do with ssh
2006-05-23T15:05:00.000Z	hastesaver	gnomefreak	go slow :)
2006-05-23T15:05:00.000Z	gnomefreak	hastesaver	;)
