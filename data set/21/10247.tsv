2005-05-10T06:16:00.000Z	yccheok		can anyone see wat i am typing??
2005-05-10T06:17:00.000Z	yccheok		i was wondering why .bash_profile does not work in ubuntu
2005-05-10T06:18:00.000Z	yccheok		it work in fedora :(
2005-05-10T06:20:00.000Z	dcraven	yccheok	.bash_profile does work in Ubuntu.
2005-05-10T06:22:00.000Z	yccheok	dcraven	i bet it doesnt.
2005-05-10T06:22:00.000Z	yccheok	dcraven	http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-1889.html
2005-05-10T06:23:00.000Z	dcraven	yccheok	If it doesn't, then I'm gonna have to start typing all of these alias' and settings that are in my bash_profile, by hand...
2005-05-10T06:23:00.000Z	yccheok	dcraven	i found out oledi. use ~/.gnomerc if we are login through GNOME DESKTOP MANAGER
2005-05-10T06:24:00.000Z	dcraven	yccheok	I don't have a .gnomerc
2005-05-10T06:24:00.000Z	yccheok	dcraven	add "source ~/.bash_profile" in .gnomerc. i should rock
2005-05-10T06:24:00.000Z	yccheok	dcraven	just create one in ur home directory if it doesnt
2005-05-10T06:25:00.000Z	dcraven	yccheok	But why? My .bash_profile is functioning fine.
2005-05-10T06:28:00.000Z	yccheok	dcraven	hem... not sure. but most of the feedback i surf through the net is that .bash_profile doesnt work. if i work for you, feel happy on it ;)
2005-05-10T06:29:00.000Z	dcraven	yccheok	all mine does is source my ~/.bashrc, enable bash completion, and call xbindkeys. It appears to do all three.
2005-05-11T10:45:00.000Z	dcraven	yccheok	I'm a sourceforge user.
