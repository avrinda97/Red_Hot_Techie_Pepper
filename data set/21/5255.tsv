2008-01-04T04:39:00.000Z	fsufitch		and gnome has something else
2008-01-04T04:40:00.000Z	randorfer	fsufitch	 system -> pref -> session or /etc/init.d/rc.* where * is the coresponding runlevel
2008-01-04T04:42:00.000Z	randorfer	fsufitch	what are you in?
2008-01-04T04:43:00.000Z	fsufitch	randorfer	fvwm-crystal
2008-01-04T04:43:00.000Z	fsufitch	randorfer	www.fvwm-crystal.org
2008-01-04T04:43:00.000Z	randorfer	fsufitch	 are you familiar with runlevels?
2008-01-04T04:47:00.000Z	randorfer	fsufitch	 what was your originally question / what are you trying to do
2008-01-04T04:48:00.000Z	fsufitch	randorfer	i'm trying to get gtk theming working by default when i log into fvwm
2008-01-04T04:50:00.000Z	fsufitch	randorfer	doesn't it just reduce to how do you run an app right after logon? like if i want to start with an xterm every time i log in
2008-01-04T04:51:00.000Z	randorfer	fsufitch	my googling says that normal startup stuff for fvwm is stored in your ~/.fvwm/startup folder
2008-01-04T04:51:00.000Z	fsufitch	randorfer	i wasn't able to find that... but thanks, i'll try it
2008-01-04T04:51:00.000Z	randorfer	fsufitch	do you need more guidance than that or can you figure it out from there?
2008-01-04T04:52:00.000Z	fsufitch	randorfer	well, what shell/program would i need to run to make gtk themes work
2008-01-04T04:53:00.000Z	randorfer	fsufitch	heh I understand, give me a second
2008-01-04T04:56:00.000Z	randorfer	fsufitch	hrm, not sure what it is going to be for buntu maybe nickrud can give some insight, should be something on the lines of gtk2-window-decorator --replace I believe
2008-01-04T05:01:00.000Z	fsufitch	randorfer	~/.fvwm/startup doesn't work
2008-01-04T05:02:00.000Z	randorfer	fsufitch	I think this pertains to your problem http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=496539
2008-01-04T05:05:00.000Z	randorfer	fsufitch	did that help?
2008-01-04T05:07:00.000Z	fsufitch	randorfer	checking now...
