2008-08-25T17:02:00.000Z	JMAC_17		should i restart before trying to connect to something again?
2008-08-25T17:03:00.000Z	IdleOne	JMAC_17	no. this is not windows we don't restart unless absolutely necessary
2008-08-25T17:35:00.000Z	IdleOne	JMAC_17	packages.ubuntu.com has all the files you need. download the .deb file and use dpkg -i package-name.deb to install
2008-08-25T17:36:00.000Z	IdleOne	JMAC_17	remember to change directory to where the .deb is saved. probably cd Desktop
2008-08-25T17:38:00.000Z	IdleOne	JMAC_17	dpkg - i will tell you what other files are needed if any and report it back to you as an error
2008-08-25T17:38:00.000Z	IdleOne	JMAC_17	that is dpkg -i ( the command ) hehe not I as in me
2008-08-25T17:41:00.000Z	IdleOne	JMAC_17	if other files are needed, same process as before download and use dpkg -i filename.deb filename2.deb filename3.deb
2008-08-25T17:42:00.000Z	IdleOne	JMAC_17	ok it is auto installing. good
2008-08-25T17:43:00.000Z	IdleOne	JMAC_17	if it did not ask for any other packages ( issue warning/ error ) then you don't
2008-08-25T17:44:00.000Z	IdleOne	JMAC_17	you can if you like but probably don't need to
2008-08-25T17:46:00.000Z	IdleOne	JMAC_17	right click on the top panel and Add to panel
2008-08-25T17:46:00.000Z	IdleOne	JMAC_17	scroll down to the network manager and add it to your panel
