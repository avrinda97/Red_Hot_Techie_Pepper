2012-04-17T13:10:00.000Z	jrib	michael_mbp	in the future just use ssh-copy-id
2012-04-17T12:58:00.000Z	jrib	michael_mbp	do you have encrypted homes enabled on the server?
2012-04-17T12:59:00.000Z	jrib	michael_mbp	check for some .ecrypt* in /home or your $HOME
2012-04-17T13:00:00.000Z	jrib	michael_mbp	check both...
2012-04-17T13:00:00.000Z	jrib	michael_mbp	is ecryptfs-utils not installed?
2012-04-17T13:01:00.000Z	jrib	michael_mbp	then it's not the issue.
2012-04-17T13:01:00.000Z	jrib	michael_mbp	are you sure you copied your pubkey correctly?
2012-04-17T13:03:00.000Z	jrib	michael_mbp	pastebin: ls -ld ~ ~/.ssh ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
