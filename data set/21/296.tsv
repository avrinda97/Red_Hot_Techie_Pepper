2012-03-18T18:29:00.000Z	dxsoulmig		anyone fancy walking me through ATI driver setup??
2012-03-18T18:30:00.000Z	dxsoulmig		yeh, i dont seem to have drivers setup
2012-03-18T18:31:00.000Z	MestreLion	dxsoulmig	does System > Additional Drivers list any proprietary driver?
2012-03-18T18:32:00.000Z	MestreLion	dxsoulmig	none? Are you sure you're using an ATI card? :P
2012-03-18T18:35:00.000Z	MestreLion	dxsoulmig	ATI 1200 ??
2012-03-18T18:38:00.000Z	MestreLion	dxsoulmig	I'm not sure if current ATI drivers works for that card
2012-03-18T18:39:00.000Z	MestreLion	dxsoulmig	I mean... I'm not sure if there *are* any proprietary linux drivers for that car
2012-03-18T18:49:00.000Z	MestreLion	dxsoulmig	stop saying that the proprietary drivers are the "proper" ones...
2012-03-18T18:49:00.000Z	MestreLion	dxsoulmig	you have an ancient card that is not supported by the proprietary drivers
2012-03-18T18:50:00.000Z	dxsoulmig	MestreLion	i didnt say that bro
2012-03-18T18:59:00.000Z	MestreLion	dxsoulmig	you are using the radeon, free drivers, which DO support your card
2012-03-18T19:00:00.000Z	MestreLion	dxsoulmig	you could write AMD and ask them to provide a proprietary driver for your card, since they don't provide one but the Linux Kernel does
2012-03-18T19:02:00.000Z	dxsoulmig	MestreLion	yes i can for it.. apparently.. ati-driver-installer-9-3-x86.x86_64.run
2012-03-18T19:03:00.000Z	MestreLion	dxsoulmig	wow, 9-3 ? That's a 3-year old driver... you sure you want that?
2012-03-18T19:05:00.000Z	MestreLion	dxsoulmig	come on man... a Radeon HD5400 costs like 30 bucks... do you want a donation?
2012-03-18T19:06:00.000Z	dxsoulmig	MestreLion	haha.. dude, its a "laptop".. its still going strong
2012-03-18T19:07:00.000Z	dxsoulmig	MestreLion	first time Linux, powered my way through loads of crap so far, but its all working ok, just thought the graph`s need some tweeking
2012-03-18T19:07:00.000Z	dxsoulmig	MestreLion	guess not
2012-03-18T19:09:00.000Z	MestreLion	dxsoulmig	I understand... but unfortunately AMD does not provide Linux drivers for your particular card (at least that works with your particular kernel)
2012-03-18T19:10:00.000Z	MestreLion	dxsoulmig	your options would be to either use the drivers provided by your current linux kernel, OR to install an ancient kernel that is compatible with the drivers provided by AMD
2012-03-18T19:14:00.000Z	dxsoulmig	MestreLion	thanks all
