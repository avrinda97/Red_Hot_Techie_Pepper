2007-09-23T09:27:00.000Z	meezyfuh	IntuitiveNipple	thanks
2007-09-23T09:27:00.000Z	meezyfuh	IntuitiveNipple	what do i do?
2007-09-23T09:28:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	meezyfuh	read the HowTo page
2007-09-23T09:28:00.000Z	meezyfuh	IntuitiveNipple	of course. thank you. :>
2007-09-23T09:33:00.000Z	meezyfuh	IntuitiveNipple	 ok, so i added the repositories, now how do i install the codecs?
2007-09-23T09:34:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	meezyfuh	Did you add them manually, or through Synaptic?
2007-09-23T09:35:00.000Z	meezyfuh	IntuitiveNipple	i did the commands you use to add the repositories, just copied & pasted. the sudo wget and stuff...
2007-09-23T09:36:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	meezyfuh	ok, have you done "sudo apt-get update" yet? of not, do that
2007-09-23T09:36:00.000Z	meezyfuh	IntuitiveNipple	done
2007-09-23T09:37:00.000Z	meezyfuh	IntuitiveNipple	i didn't realize i wasn't searching 'all open source' in synaptic. so i found the gstreamer. will those help?
2007-09-23T09:38:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	meezyfuh	You can install any of the packages listed at http://www.medibuntu.org/packages.php now by typing "sudo apt-get install <package>, or, if you want to browse, by using System > Administration > Synaptic Package Manager
2007-09-23T09:39:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	meezyfuh	Add/Remove lists the popular common packages; Synaptic lists *all* packages available in the repositories you have enabled
2007-09-23T09:40:00.000Z	meezyfuh	IntuitiveNipple	ahhh, got it. now, will the 'gstreamer' audio codec(s) in add/remove work for playing real audio in the default movie player?
2007-09-23T09:40:00.000Z	meezyfuh	IntuitiveNipple	which is 'totem'
2007-09-23T09:40:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	meezyfuh	It's so long since I did that I don't remember :p
2007-09-23T09:40:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	meezyfuh	but something sure installs them :)
2007-09-23T09:41:00.000Z	meezyfuh	IntuitiveNipple	thanks for all your help, sorry to bother you
