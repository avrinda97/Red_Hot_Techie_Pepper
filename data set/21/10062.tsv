2005-05-22T11:34:00.000Z	Thirsteh		gl4, reject=visible, but closed, drop=invisible and closed.
2005-05-22T11:34:00.000Z	Thirsteh		:)
2005-05-22T11:35:00.000Z	Thirsteh		Easier way of saying it
2005-05-22T11:36:00.000Z	Thirsteh		gl4, no, it doesn't.
2005-05-22T11:36:00.000Z	Thirsteh		gl4, I tested it after I installed Ubuntu, and my ports were closed, not stealth.
2005-05-22T11:38:00.000Z	Thirsteh		gl4, unless you suffer from paranoia ^
2005-05-22T11:38:00.000Z	Thirsteh		Or you are hiding from several government agencies
2005-05-22T11:38:00.000Z	Thirsteh		They'll prolly find you anyway, though...
2005-05-22T11:38:00.000Z	krazykook	Thirsteh	no the FBI knows exactly where i am at.....i don't care to hide...i just want to get my papers to leave this god damned country
2005-05-22T11:39:00.000Z	Thirsteh	krazykook	and I want to get the papers to enter that god damned country :\
2005-05-22T11:40:00.000Z	krazykook	Thirsteh	you want want to be here when the FBI and the State and everyone else forces you to starve without a job for 11 years and don't even give you food stamps....and those bastards steal your wife and won't let you even talk to your children
2005-05-22T11:41:00.000Z	krazykook	Thirsteh	so i guarantee ....you do not want to come to this god-dammed country
2005-05-22T11:41:00.000Z	Thirsteh	krazykook	my fiancee lives there, it's not really an option. :)
2005-05-22T11:42:00.000Z	krazykook	Thirsteh	well wait until the State steals her and your children and rapes all of them and will not even let you speak to them
2005-05-22T11:42:00.000Z	krazykook	Thirsteh	and then the FBI gets into it and takes the States' side
2005-05-22T11:42:00.000Z	krazykook	Thirsteh	and then the damn psychologist pimps that work for the state declare you insane
2005-05-22T11:43:00.000Z	krazykook	Thirsteh	i wouldn't doubt it...they don't like communistic related linux either
2005-05-22T11:44:00.000Z	krazykook	Thirsteh	they are just like the pimps in the Universities
2005-05-22T11:45:00.000Z	Thirsteh	krazykook	where exactly do they take them?
