2005-08-26T16:46:00.000Z	cyphase	ifr	i've tried it, but it's better to use the default packages

2005-08-26T16:46:00.000Z	ifr	cyphase	I know what you mean but for my dad having it all in one place was easier for him. . .
2005-08-26T16:46:00.000Z	cyphase		instead of having to set up zones and such for dns, you just say "make mail.myserver.com point here"
2005-08-26T16:46:00.000Z	ifr		yeah I see what you mean.
