2011-03-20T07:53:00.000Z	johnsavior		Hi I've got a tarball installation file, how do I install it?
2011-03-20T07:54:00.000Z	sagaci	johnsavior	what's it for
2011-03-20T07:54:00.000Z	sagaci	johnsavior	is that what it's called
2011-03-20T07:56:00.000Z	johnsavior	sagaci	yes, I downloaded the tar installer for linux but I can't seem to install it
2011-03-20T07:56:00.000Z	sagaci	johnsavior	you need to extract it first
2011-03-20T07:57:00.000Z	johnsavior	sagaci	uhm i did, after that I do not know what to do
2011-03-20T07:57:00.000Z	sagaci	johnsavior	what's in the resulting directory
2011-03-20T07:59:00.000Z	sagaci	johnsavior	README, INSTALL
2011-03-20T08:02:00.000Z	sagaci	johnsavior	wouldn't have a clue, I'd have to look at the package
2011-03-20T08:05:00.000Z	johnsavior	sagaci	i'm sending you the file
2011-03-20T08:05:00.000Z	sagaci	johnsavior	I know but any particular reason why you aren't installing it via the repos
2011-03-20T08:06:00.000Z	johnsavior	sagaci	i tried app but it's not available there
2011-03-20T08:06:00.000Z	sagaci	johnsavior	?
2011-03-20T08:06:00.000Z	sagaci	johnsavior	what version of ubuntu are you using
2011-03-20T08:07:00.000Z	johnsavior	sagaci	10.10
2011-03-20T08:07:00.000Z	sagaci	johnsavior	it's in maverick 10.10, the same version you're trying to install via source. You're much better and easier to install the version that's already been packaged
2011-03-20T08:08:00.000Z	sagaci	johnsavior	just go sudo apt-get update
2011-03-20T08:08:00.000Z	sagaci	johnsavior	then sudo apt-get install g2ipmsg
2011-03-20T08:10:00.000Z	sagaci	johnsavior	please, just install it via the terminal or synaptic. You're making it much harder for everyone unless you want to learn how to compile from source
2011-03-20T08:11:00.000Z	johnsavior	sagaci	:) okay i will, I'm still trying to get comfortable with Ubuntu
2011-03-20T08:12:00.000Z	sagaci	johnsavior	lots of things can stuff up if you don't know what you're doing, and even then there could be broken parts of your package if you don't know how to fix them manually
