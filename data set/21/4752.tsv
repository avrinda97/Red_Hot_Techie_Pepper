2008-02-20T11:35:00.000Z	AtomicSpark	norml_advocat2	i am :D
2008-02-20T11:40:00.000Z	AtomicSpark	norml_advocat2	i assume you mean xserver. startx is the command to start it. :P
2008-02-20T11:42:00.000Z	AtomicSpark	norml_advocat2	no. unfortunately, ubuntu doesnt use run levels. in other distros, you can change your run level to 3, and everything will be terminal only. you may beable to log out and change your session to terminal only. i am not sure. once gnome or kde is installed, it takes over. :P
2008-02-20T11:45:00.000Z	AtomicSpark	norml_advocat2	what are you trying to do? boot into terminal only then have the option to switch to gui?
2008-02-20T11:46:00.000Z	AtomicSpark	norml_advocat2	haha. you may not beable to do that, because of how ubuntu doesnt use run levels (afaik) but let me check if you can log into terminal only.
2008-02-20T12:02:00.000Z	AtomicSpark	norml_advocat2	i wish you luck being an extreme hacker ;)
2008-02-20T12:04:00.000Z	AtomicSpark	norml_advocat2	why do you hate windows?
2008-02-20T12:05:00.000Z	AtomicSpark	norml_advocat2	thats a user problem not a operating system issue. and what did you beat me to? :P i'm not an "op"
2008-02-20T12:07:00.000Z	AtomicSpark	norml_advocat2	i'm still iffy about what you're trying to do since everything i read states that ubuntu doesnt use runlevels. but hey i'm not going to argue. lol.
2008-02-20T12:08:00.000Z	AtomicSpark	norml_advocat2	repost what? i saw what he said. i know it would work on redhat or suse, but ubuntu? donno.
2008-02-20T12:08:00.000Z	AtomicSpark	norml_advocat2	something for me to look into now.
2008-02-20T12:15:00.000Z	AtomicSpark	norml_advocat2	you're alll about being a extreme hacker aren't you?
2008-02-20T12:17:00.000Z	AtomicSpark	norml_advocat2	i've used it before
2008-02-20T12:18:00.000Z	AtomicSpark	norml_advocat2	you don't want to install it in ubuntu. you should use this live cd. which ill get you a link.
2008-02-20T12:19:00.000Z	AtomicSpark	norml_advocat2	http://www.remote-exploit.org/backtrack.html
2008-02-20T12:19:00.000Z	AtomicSpark	norml_advocat2	do not use this illegally. kthxbai.
2008-02-20T12:20:00.000Z	AtomicSpark	norml_advocat2	internet speak. ha. you need to learn ninja hacking skillz. but anyways. 1. its only supported on a few wireless cars, which you probably dont have. 2. to get it working on other cards is almost impossible sometimes requiring custom linux binaries. 3. only works on wep, which nobody should ever, ever use.
2008-02-20T12:21:00.000Z	AtomicSpark	norml_advocat2	no.
2008-02-20T12:22:00.000Z	AtomicSpark	norml_advocat2	not even a slight hope of broadcom support. there is a link on there somewhere that says what is supported. mostly aeoros (sp) cards.
2008-02-20T12:23:00.000Z	AtomicSpark	norml_advocat2	basically you'll be buying a pcmci (wow i dont even remember what this is called) card for your laptop if you want to use it. or a usb one. no internal.
