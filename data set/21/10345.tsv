2005-10-04T09:13:00.000Z	AnguS		PLEASE can someone with a windows dual-boot system paste me his GRUB lines to boot the windows partition? breezy wiped them out here...
2005-10-04T09:14:00.000Z	tritium	AnguS	why do you say that breezy wiped them out?
2005-10-04T09:14:00.000Z	AnguS	tritium	because it worked fine, then it upgraded the kernel, i rebooted and windows was out of the grub menu
2005-10-04T09:15:00.000Z	tritium	AnguS	upgrading the kernel only adds a new kernel to the menu
2005-10-04T09:15:00.000Z	AnguS	tritium	it doesnt
2005-10-04T09:15:00.000Z	tritium	AnguS	really, I mean it
2005-10-04T09:16:00.000Z	tritium	AnguS	hoary or breezy?
2005-10-04T09:16:00.000Z	AnguS	tritium	and i really mean that breezy wiped my fucking windows boot entry out of grub each time i upgraded the kernel, i always had to add windows manually via the system\administration\boot tool
2005-10-04T09:16:00.000Z	tritium	AnguS	please watch your language
2005-10-04T09:16:00.000Z	AnguS	tritium	breezxy
2005-10-04T09:17:00.000Z	tritium	AnguS	that's not normal operation.
2005-10-04T09:18:00.000Z	tritium	AnguS	was the windows partition detected during install?  If not, when you added it, did you run update-grub?
2005-10-04T09:18:00.000Z	AnguS	tritium	yes it was detected during install
2005-10-04T09:19:00.000Z	AnguS	tritium	then on the first kernel upgrade i did it got away
2005-10-04T09:19:00.000Z	tritium	AnguS	sounds fishy
2005-10-04T09:20:00.000Z	AnguS	tritium	i had to add windows each time after an upgrade via that panel that is now gone
2005-10-04T09:22:00.000Z	tritium	AnguS	perhaps that gui you used altered grubs behavior, because windows should not ever have been deleted from the list
2005-10-04T09:23:00.000Z	AnguS	tritium	might be, i used that tool to set windows xp as default partition
2005-10-04T09:23:00.000Z	tritium	AnguS	and if you ever manually edit /boot/grub/menu.lst, always be sure to run "sudo update-grub" after
2005-10-04T09:23:00.000Z	AnguS	tritium	probably it messed up something
2005-10-04T09:23:00.000Z	tritium	AnguS	now that I'd believe
