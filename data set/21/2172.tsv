2010-06-10T11:30:00.000Z	Callum__		hmm, I wish someone could tell me why Ubuntu One Music Store's music is encoded in MP3
2010-06-10T11:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Callum__	interesting.
2010-06-10T11:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Callum__	exactly. I think its real weird
2010-06-10T11:33:00.000Z	Callum__	ActionParsnip	for a company promoting open source and patent-free products, I think its almost hypocritical
2010-06-10T11:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Callum__	all I can think is its so folks can download the music as dumb ipods don't play ogg as its too awesome :)
2010-06-10T11:36:00.000Z	Callum__	ActionParsnip	who uses Linux only with an iPod when they have to have either Mac OS or Windows to set it up using iTunes >_>
2010-06-10T11:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Callum__	I don't use apple products on principle as well as they suck
2010-06-10T11:37:00.000Z	Callum__	ActionParsnip	same here, the only one actually worth considering IMO is the iPod touch
2010-06-10T11:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Callum__	could log a bug ;). All ipods are rubbish, so little features for so much cash, but its shiny shiny
2010-06-10T11:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Callum__	oh yeah jailbreak definately required
2010-11-04T22:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Callum__	thunderbird has no exchange support
2010-11-04T22:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Callum__	so betterness depends on requirements
2010-11-04T22:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Callum__	you mean the little envelope thing?
2010-11-04T22:32:00.000Z	Callum__	ActionParsnip	well, yeah I guess so

2010-11-04T22:35:00.000Z	Callum__	ActionParsnip	Cool, thanks =P
2010-11-04T22:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Callum__	simple websearches dude
2010-11-17T13:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Callum__	is there a bug logged for it?
2010-11-17T13:33:00.000Z	Callum__	ActionParsnip	no idea
2010-11-17T13:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Callum__	worth checking the bugs first, it may be a known issue
2010-11-17T13:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Callum__	there also may be a ppa with a later version which may help
