2012-04-04T12:29:00.000Z	iqrama_	dfcnvt	all solutions are not working, i have tried using vlc and the camera is working alright, but with skype no, maybe i should try restarting my machine
2012-04-04T12:35:00.000Z	iqrama_	dfcnvt	i did
2012-04-04T12:35:00.000Z	dfcnvt	iqrama_	and the result of luvcview?
2012-04-04T12:37:00.000Z	dfcnvt	iqrama_	Then try this, luvcview -d /dev/video1
2012-04-04T12:38:00.000Z	iqrama_	dfcnvt	ok
2012-04-04T12:39:00.000Z	iqrama_	dfcnvt	ok
2012-04-04T12:39:00.000Z	dfcnvt	iqrama_	So, did you get the camera working?
2012-04-04T12:39:00.000Z	dfcnvt	iqrama_	Did it show your face?
2012-04-04T12:41:00.000Z	dfcnvt	iqrama_	If it work and it showed your face... Then I guess a restart would resolve back to /dev/video0 than /dev/video1
2012-04-04T12:45:00.000Z	iqrama_	dfcnvt	still not happening
2012-04-04T12:45:00.000Z	dfcnvt	iqrama_	After you run "luvcview -d /dev/video1" ... Did it show your face?
2012-04-04T12:46:00.000Z	dfcnvt	iqrama_	Why don't you run "ls /dev/video*" to see if you do have it there.
2012-04-04T12:47:00.000Z	dfcnvt	iqrama_	Nothing on /dev/video* ?
2012-04-04T12:48:00.000Z	dfcnvt	iqrama_	Ah, you do have it there.. So, how about try "luvcview -d video0" then smile for the result.
2012-04-04T12:50:00.000Z	dfcnvt	iqrama_	correct, not here on the irc.. on the terminal. :p
2012-04-04T12:57:00.000Z	dfcnvt	iqrama_	Can you give me the model of your camera?

2012-04-04T13:07:00.000Z	dfcnvt	iqrama_	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Spca5xx#Step_1:_Get_the_spca5xx_source_code
2012-04-04T13:08:00.000Z	dfcnvt	iqrama_	For your camera... It would need spca5xx driver... So, this website should be the best to help solve your problem. Good luck.
2012-04-04T13:18:00.000Z	dfcnvt	iqrama_	I hope everything worked out for you. sacarlson can probably help you but ask anybody here with long experience on linux and camera.
