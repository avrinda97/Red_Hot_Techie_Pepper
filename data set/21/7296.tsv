2007-02-01T15:15:00.000Z	slacker_nl		how do I do this?
2007-02-01T15:15:00.000Z	slacker_nl		echo "bla" > /dev/ttyS3 is not working..
2007-02-01T15:16:00.000Z	slacker_nl		hello
2007-02-01T15:17:00.000Z	slacker_nl		echo "AT" > /dev/ttySx does not work, can someone help me with this?
2007-02-01T15:17:00.000Z	rausb0	slacker_nl	what is connected to /dev/ttyS3? a modem?
2007-02-01T15:17:00.000Z	slacker_nl	rausb0	a UMTS card (so yes a modem)
2007-02-01T15:18:00.000Z	rausb0	slacker_nl	and you are sure it registers as /dev/ttySx (not /dev/ttyUSBx)?
2007-02-01T15:19:00.000Z	slacker_nl	rausb0	I'm sure, with minicom it works fine
2007-02-01T15:20:00.000Z	rausb0	slacker_nl	echo works one way, you won't see a reaction from the card
2007-02-01T15:20:00.000Z	rausb0	slacker_nl	so use minicom or screen to talk to the card
2007-02-01T15:20:00.000Z	rausb0	slacker_nl	what do you want to do with the echo command? send an initstring?
2007-02-01T15:21:00.000Z	slacker_nl	rausb0	not an option
2007-02-01T15:21:00.000Z	slacker_nl	rausb0	yes, see this page http://www.xs4all.nl/helpdesk/mobielinternet/umts/linux/index.php (then look for the PIN script)
2007-02-01T15:23:00.000Z	rausb0	slacker_nl	okay, that script just sends the pin regardless if it was set before. some umts card don't like that.
2007-02-01T15:23:00.000Z	slacker_nl	rausb0	I have the same UMTS card ;)
2007-02-01T15:24:00.000Z	rausb0	slacker_nl	at+cpin? will ask the card if the pin was already given
2007-02-01T15:24:00.000Z	rausb0	slacker_nl	but anyway, you won't see the card's answer if you use echo to output a string to it
2007-02-01T15:24:00.000Z	slacker_nl	rausb0	hold on.. something is working..
2007-02-01T15:38:00.000Z	slacker_nl	rausb0	I managed to get it working
2007-02-01T15:39:00.000Z	slacker_nl	rausb0	but I'm also resending the pin, and it indeed does not like it..
