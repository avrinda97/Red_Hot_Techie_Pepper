2011-11-26T12:21:00.000Z	markkkz		anybody know whatis the equivalent of 'klogd' or 'syslog.conf' on Ubuntu? I cannot find it in /etc
2011-11-26T12:23:00.000Z	soreau	markkkz	It may be more practical for you to explain what problem you are having and how you are aiming to fix it
2011-11-26T12:25:00.000Z	markkkz	soreau	trying to see what messages are there on boot. I also want to change the verbose level if that is possible.
2011-11-26T12:39:00.000Z	soreau	markkkz	See the topic or channel info there
2011-11-26T12:26:00.000Z	soreau	markkkz	That doesnt explain what trouble you are having or the reason why you want to do that
2011-11-26T12:27:00.000Z	markkkz	soreau	There is no problem. I want to look at what are these messages on init. That is why I asked which log is it written to - syslog or dmesg will do?
2011-11-26T12:29:00.000Z	soreau	markkkz	You can set certain modules to be more verbose, but not sure about how to make the kernel be more verbose in general.. try ##linux maybe
2011-11-26T12:31:00.000Z	soreau	markkkz	If you could see all the internal messages that happen inside your computer, you could fill up volumes of meaningless jargon
2011-11-26T12:32:00.000Z	markkkz	soreau	That's ok. The fact that it is there has aroused my curiousity. Why is it there? Why are these not logged? If so, there may be ways to log these or suppress it from showing on the terminal.
2011-11-26T12:33:00.000Z	soreau	markkkz	Try ##linux
2011-11-26T12:33:00.000Z	markkkz	soreau	is that linux IRC channel?
2011-11-26T12:34:00.000Z	markkkz	soreau	same server - freenode?
2011-11-26T12:34:00.000Z	soreau	markkkz	yes, the linux channel on freenode
2011-11-26T12:35:00.000Z	markkkz	soreau	Thanks. I'll try.
2011-11-26T12:38:00.000Z	markkkz	soreau	darn, can't talk on ##linux . it is being moderated.
2011-11-26T12:39:00.000Z	soreau	markkkz	Chanserv tells you what to do
2011-11-26T12:40:00.000Z	soreau	markkkz	To have access to most channels, you want a real irc client, ie not using a web client, and a registered nick
2011-11-26T12:41:00.000Z	markkkz	soreau	Thanks. I read it. Ithink  I won't bother. The people there might not want to bother with my newbie question. LOL!
2011-11-26T12:41:00.000Z	soreau	markkkz	Some channels have requirements to cut down on spam etc
2011-11-26T12:42:00.000Z	soreau	markkkz	Also, many channels that have these requirements often yield some of the best information. Its never a bad idea to have a registered nick on freenode as its a valuable resource etc etc blah blah
2011-11-26T12:44:00.000Z	markkkz	soreau	Ayt, I'll register when google gives me zero. :) thanks man... ...
