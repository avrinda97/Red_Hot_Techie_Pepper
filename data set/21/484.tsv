2011-11-19T05:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	office3	xfce4 smells and feels like Gnome2
2011-11-19T12:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	office3	absolutely, provided you have space
2011-11-19T12:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	office3	depends what packages you have installed. If you use apt-get it will tell you how much space it will use and you can say NO if it is too much
2011-11-19T12:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	office3	shouldn't be a lot
2011-11-19T12:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	office3	depends how many you run at the same time
2011-11-19T23:54:00.000Z	office3	ActionParsnip	have you been on since early this morning?
2011-12-14T22:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	office3	does CTRL+ALT+F1 work?
2011-12-14T22:33:00.000Z	office3	ActionParsnip	sorry, no, CTRL+ALT+F1 doesn't work
2011-12-14T22:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	office3	is it a laptop?
2011-12-14T22:34:00.000Z	office3	ActionParsnip	yes it is a laptop
2011-12-14T22:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	office3	what make and model?
2011-12-14T22:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	office3	is "dell 1580" the full model name?
2011-12-14T22:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	office3	sure it's not a lattitude or an inspiron or somesuch?
2011-12-14T22:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	office3	try pressing the switch to monitor key a few times til it switches, may make it wake up
2011-12-14T22:48:00.000Z	office3	ActionParsnip	no change
