2007-01-22T08:31:00.000Z	what_if		I updated my ubuntu edgy, reinstalled my Nvidia drivers and now anything that is full screen 3D crashes the X server, no error in the Xorg.log
2007-01-22T08:31:00.000Z	what_if		any ideas ?
2007-01-22T08:32:00.000Z	SilentDis	what_if	there's always something in that xorg.log file, just might not be at the bottom.  can you pastebin it for me?
2007-01-22T08:32:00.000Z	what_if	SilentDis	shure, hold on
2007-01-22T08:32:00.000Z	SilentDis	what_if	thanks :)

2007-01-22T08:39:00.000Z	SilentDis	what_if	checking now, thank you :)
2007-01-22T08:40:00.000Z	SilentDis	what_if	do you have a wacom tablet or some such on that machine?
2007-01-22T08:40:00.000Z	what_if	SilentDis	not yet :) why ?
2007-01-22T08:40:00.000Z	SilentDis	what_if	just noticing a lot of init errors for it, is all
2007-01-22T08:41:00.000Z	what_if	SilentDis	I am using the default xorg.conf, is setup for everything :)
2007-01-22T08:41:00.000Z	SilentDis	what_if	wow, it's doing a lot of probing... are you still booting from the LiveCD?
2007-01-22T08:41:00.000Z	what_if	SilentDis	nope
2007-01-22T08:41:00.000Z	what_if	SilentDis	it worked fine before the updates
2007-01-22T08:42:00.000Z	SilentDis	what_if	try a reconfigure of the xorg package:  sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-01-22T08:55:00.000Z	what_if	SilentDis	ok, tried the reconfigure of the xorg package, it messed things up so I copied the original org.conf back. Any idea how to troubleshoot the 3d ?
2007-01-22T08:56:00.000Z	SilentDis	what_if	you're just trying to setup your card for proper 3d?  do you have reservations about using the non-free binary blobs right from the card manufacturer?
2007-01-22T08:57:00.000Z	what_if	SilentDis	I am already using the Nvidia binary drivers and 3d works, just when a program goes "full screen" the server crashes
2007-01-22T08:57:00.000Z	SilentDis	what_if	now that's just weird...  i'm not sure what could cause that in the way of settings.  i was gonna suggest envy otherwise heh
2007-01-22T08:58:00.000Z	what_if	SilentDis	I'm lost too, it worked until I did the software updates
2007-01-22T08:59:00.000Z	SilentDis	what_if	i'd almost say to just try envy, can't hurt, and virtually guarntees a perfect build/install every time.
