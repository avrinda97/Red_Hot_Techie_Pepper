2008-07-10T20:12:00.000Z	Noia		I'm trying to set up SSH keys, and it seems to work half-way, it says "Passphrase for key "imported-openssh-key"", so its picking up the key but it seems it still wants a password, however it is now the passphrase for the key not the password for the account...how do I make it not require the passphrase ?
2008-07-10T20:13:00.000Z	soundray	Noia	use 'ssh-add' to make ssh-agent remember your passphrase for the duration of your gnome session
2008-07-10T20:15:00.000Z	Noia	soundray	huh? I don't have gnome. I'm setting up keys on my ubuntu server so I can auto-connect for svn etc
2008-07-10T20:15:00.000Z	Noia	soundray	as I said, it seems to half work but I'm clearly missing something
2008-07-10T20:15:00.000Z	soundray	Noia	then you have to setup ssh-agent to cover your bash session
2008-07-10T20:16:00.000Z	soundray	Noia	or generate an unprotected ssh key without a passphrase (but that's not recommended)
2008-07-10T20:16:00.000Z	Noia	soundray	I'm following this tutorial; http://tortoisesvn.net/ssh_howto
2008-07-10T20:18:00.000Z	soundray	Noia	do you have Windows on the client side?
2008-07-10T20:19:00.000Z	Noia	soundray	yes, the mac should be much easier, I've gone thrugh the putty steps
2008-07-10T20:19:00.000Z	Noia	soundray	I get the feeling that its not _quite_ doing the keys right on the server side
2008-07-10T20:20:00.000Z	soundray	Noia	can you describe the actual problem again?
2008-07-10T20:20:00.000Z	Noia	soundray	when I connect it should not require a password, instead it now requires the passphrase for the private key. I can log in via putty but it should be automatic
2008-07-10T20:21:00.000Z	soundray	Noia	if you don't want it to require a passphrase to unlock your key, you have to set up a key without a passphrase.
2008-07-10T20:22:00.000Z	soundray	Noia	or you need ssh-agent to manage the key for you, but this applies to Linux clients.#
2008-07-10T20:22:00.000Z	Noia	soundray	-_- I thought it could be done with a challenge-responce thing without having to type anything
2008-07-10T20:23:00.000Z	soundray	Noia	only if your ssh key is unlocked
2008-07-10T20:23:00.000Z	Noia	soundray	but I followed the tutorial >.< waah
2008-07-10T20:23:00.000Z	soundray	Noia	the tutorial is not for Linux clients
2008-07-10T20:24:00.000Z	Noia	soundray	my server is linux, my client in this case is windows
2008-07-10T20:24:00.000Z	Noia	soundray	it is the correct tutorial, but I don't understand what the problem is
2008-07-10T20:25:00.000Z	soundray	Noia	I don't think you fully understand what the tutorial is for
