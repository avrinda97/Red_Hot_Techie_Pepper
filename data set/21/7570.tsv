2006-12-07T10:59:00.000Z	philo23		hi, i need help installing a program via the terminal
2006-12-07T11:00:00.000Z	scylax	philo23	apt-get install program
2006-12-07T11:00:00.000Z	philo23		everytime i try to run the command "make", it tells me that the file is not found
2006-12-07T11:00:00.000Z	scylax		can anyone tell me how to configure the !"$% mail command ?
2006-12-07T11:00:00.000Z	scylax		oh philo23 in that case you need to install build-essential with apt-get
2006-12-07T11:01:00.000Z	philo23		i've ran configure, before hand
2006-12-07T11:01:00.000Z	philo23		ok
2006-12-07T11:01:00.000Z	scylax	philo23	that will install make, gcc and all that
2006-12-07T11:01:00.000Z	philo23	scylax	still no luck
2006-12-07T11:02:00.000Z	scylax		what's the error now philo23
2006-12-07T11:02:00.000Z	philo23		its always said "make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop."
2006-12-07T11:03:00.000Z	scylax	philo23	you sure your ./configure worked allright ?
2006-12-07T11:03:00.000Z	scylax		please, how do i configure system wide SMTP server , like the one used by the mail command ?
2006-12-07T11:04:00.000Z	philo23	scylax	pretty sure, it does say "E: Couldn't find package libuuid" at the end, which makes me think no
2006-12-07T11:04:00.000Z	scylax		yeah philo23 so if your configure didn't work you can't launch make
2006-12-07T11:04:00.000Z	philo23	scylax	whats up with configure then?
2006-12-07T11:07:00.000Z	philo23	scylax	any ideas then?
2006-12-07T11:07:00.000Z	scylax	philo23	you gotta find out why configure didn't work
2006-12-07T11:07:00.000Z	philo23	scylax	it says libuuid not found
2006-12-07T11:08:00.000Z	scylax	philo23	if i were you i'd copy that error message and google for it
2006-12-07T11:09:00.000Z	philo23	scylax	i just checked on synaptic package manager, i have libuuid installed
