2005-03-14T17:05:00.000Z	PacoBCN		speaking of mplayer
2005-03-14T17:05:00.000Z	PacoBCN		can't find a way to play videos full screen :S
2005-03-14T17:06:00.000Z	pestilence	PacoBCN	i think you just type "f"
2005-03-14T17:07:00.000Z	pestilence	PacoBCN	never had that problem.  perhaps you are using the wrong -vo
2005-03-14T17:07:00.000Z	pestilence	PacoBCN	maybe mplayer -vo xv
2005-03-14T17:09:00.000Z	pestilence	PacoBCN	you installed from multiverse?
2005-03-14T17:10:00.000Z	pestilence	PacoBCN	they don't have mplayer in warty, is why i ask.
2005-03-14T17:11:00.000Z	pestilence	PacoBCN	oh...well, my suspicion is that it is in multiverse nonetheless...and those really are debian packages
2005-03-14T17:11:00.000Z	pestilence	PacoBCN	yes, image stretches to fill the screen
2005-03-14T17:12:00.000Z	pestilence	PacoBCN	apt-cache show mplayer-custom
2005-03-14T17:15:00.000Z	PacoBCN	pestilence	It found nothing
2005-03-14T17:15:00.000Z	pestilence	PacoBCN	apt-cache search mplayer
2005-03-14T17:17:00.000Z	pestilence	PacoBCN	it is really not that difficult to compile, especially the 100th time you do it :)
2005-03-14T17:18:00.000Z	PacoBCN	pestilence	I know, I've done it 3 times already
2005-03-14T17:18:00.000Z	pestilence	PacoBCN	i believe all of the development libraries are apt-get'able
2005-03-14T17:19:00.000Z	pestilence	PacoBCN	disk space is cheap these days :)
2005-03-14T17:20:00.000Z	pestilence	PacoBCN	so remove the dev libraries after building
2005-03-14T17:20:00.000Z	pestilence	PacoBCN	but yes, i think that is more of a PITA
2005-03-14T17:21:00.000Z	pestilence	PacoBCN	pain in the ass
2005-03-14T17:22:00.000Z	pestilence	PacoBCN	but there is certainly a way to do anything you want, including removing all of the dev libraries
2005-03-14T17:23:00.000Z	PacoBCN	pestilence	well, in theory I should be able
