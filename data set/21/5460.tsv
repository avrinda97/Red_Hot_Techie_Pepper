2007-10-15T16:21:00.000Z	Ling-Ling		answer: $Display
2007-10-15T16:21:00.000Z	Ling-Ling		this should be right
2007-10-15T16:22:00.000Z	Ling-Ling		i got: $DISPLAY
2007-10-15T16:23:00.000Z	geirha	Ling-Ling	that's very weird
2007-10-15T16:10:00.000Z	geirha	Ling-Ling	ssh -X username@host
2007-10-15T16:10:00.000Z	geirha	Ling-Ling	then X apps should work
2007-10-15T16:11:00.000Z	geirha	Ling-Ling	X forwarding, you need to either specify -X to ssh, or configure it in ssh_config
2007-10-15T16:13:00.000Z	geirha	Ling-Ling	what does "echo $DISPLAY" say?
2007-10-15T16:15:00.000Z	geirha	Ling-Ling	then X forwarding is not enabled, you passed -X to ssh?
2007-10-15T16:15:00.000Z	geirha	Ling-Ling	the -X should be before the host
2007-10-15T16:18:00.000Z	geirha	Ling-Ling	capital X -X not -x
2007-10-15T16:20:00.000Z	geirha	Ling-Ling	echo $DISPLAY still doesn't give any output?
2007-10-15T16:21:00.000Z	geirha	Ling-Ling	DISPLAY with all capital letters. Linux (and thus ubuntu) is mostly case sensitive
2007-10-15T16:26:00.000Z	geirha	Ling-Ling	well, you could try to use nano instead of gedit
