2007-05-19T14:20:00.000Z	ttjl_	bruenig	no i dont
2007-05-19T14:20:00.000Z	bruenig	ttjl_	as in have you read the documentation or whatever else exists that tells you. Is there an INSTALL file or a README
2007-05-19T14:21:00.000Z	ttjl_	bruenig	yes it is the install file im trying to execute. The documentation says just double click after making the file executable
2007-05-19T14:21:00.000Z	ttjl_	bruenig	but it tells me i dont have permission grr
2007-05-19T14:21:00.000Z	bruenig	ttjl_	by INSTALL file I mean a text file literally called "INSTALL" but ok, it says to make a particular file executable, what is the name of that file?
2007-05-19T14:22:00.000Z	ttjl_	bruenig	twonkymedia-i386-glib-2.2.5.sh
2007-05-19T14:22:00.000Z	bruenig	ttjl_	ok cd into the directory with that and do this: chmod +x twonkymedia-i386-glib-2.2.5.sh && ./twonkymedia-i386-glib-2.2.5.sh
2007-05-19T14:23:00.000Z	ttjl_	bruenig	one second
2007-05-19T14:26:00.000Z	ttjl_	bruenig	get this message: mkdir: cannot create directory '/usr/local/TwonkyVision': Permission denied
2007-05-19T14:26:00.000Z	bruenig	ttjl_	if you copy and pasted that command I gave you, it should not give you that message
2007-05-19T14:27:00.000Z	ttjl_	bruenig	I used this command: chmod +x twonkymedia-i386-glib-2.2.5.sh && ./twonkymedia-i386-glib-2.2.5.sh
2007-05-19T14:28:00.000Z	bruenig	ttjl_	woops chmod +x twonkymedia-i386-glib-2.2.5.sh && sudo ./twonkymedia-i386-glib-2.2.5.sh
