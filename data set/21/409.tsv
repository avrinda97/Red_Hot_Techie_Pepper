2012-01-06T00:16:00.000Z	tielhalter_		i'm trying to play UT2004 and other OpenGL-based games on linux, and there are very slow. I'm have AMD A6 Quad and AMD Radeon 6520 and AMD Radeon 6670
2012-01-06T00:18:00.000Z	tielhalter_		thx benbloom
2012-01-06T00:18:00.000Z	tielhalter_		!fglrx
2012-01-06T00:19:00.000Z	WalterN	tielhalter_	it seems the 6000 series is rather buggy with the AMD drivers still... I cant really play eve online.. some issues with it
2012-01-06T00:22:00.000Z	WalterN	tielhalter_	are you using the AMD drivers?
2012-01-06T00:23:00.000Z	WalterN	tielhalter_	yes what?
2012-01-06T00:24:00.000Z	WalterN	tielhalter_	ok, the latest one? or the one that you get from the restricted drivers thingy?
2012-01-06T00:25:00.000Z	tielhalter_	WalterN	latest, from official website.
2012-01-06T00:26:00.000Z	WalterN	tielhalter_	if they are installed properly then yeah, what I said before...
2012-01-06T00:26:00.000Z	WalterN	tielhalter_	drivers are too buggy still
2012-01-06T00:27:00.000Z	WalterN	tielhalter_	play minecraft instead :)
2012-01-06T00:27:00.000Z	tielhalter_	WalterN	i want world of warcraft :(
2012-01-06T00:29:00.000Z	tielhalter_	WalterN	do you know any resources about fglrx or about configuring xorg for work with ATI cards?
2012-01-06T00:31:00.000Z	WalterN	tielhalter_	the thing to do is check the logs to see if the driver is loading properly, and/or check the command glxgears and see if its laggy when you open it up full screen
2012-01-06T00:35:00.000Z	tielhalter_	WalterN	I don't see any image in glxgears window, but in console i'm have ~3200fps oO there is first time, when i don't see gears.
2012-01-06T00:36:00.000Z	tielhalter_	WalterN	in fullscreen ~1400fps
2012-01-06T00:36:00.000Z	WalterN	tielhalter_	hmm... dont see anything in the window when you run glxgears.... sounds like something in the driver is not working properly
2012-01-06T00:36:00.000Z	WalterN	tielhalter_	look at the logs and see what the error is then :)
2012-01-06T00:42:00.000Z	tielhalter_	WalterN	i didn't find any errors in glxgears output, /var/log/Xorg.0.log and /var/log/dmesg. Is there any other log files?
2012-01-06T00:43:00.000Z	WalterN	tielhalter_	just xorg.0.log... and that would probably mean that the driver is buggy
2012-01-06T00:44:00.000Z	tielhalter_	WalterN	okay, thanks!
