2005-04-25T09:13:00.000Z	desrt		shad0w1e; i think there is a wikipage on upgrading from warty to hoary
2005-04-25T09:13:00.000Z	desrt		Primal79; just poking at you right now :)
2005-04-25T09:13:00.000Z	desrt		Primal79; you don't need to install any firewall software
2005-04-25T09:14:00.000Z	desrt		Primal79; wow.  your ISP filters a *lot* of ports
2005-04-25T09:14:00.000Z	desrt		21, 22, 23, 25, 80, 135-139, 445, 1080, 1433, 6588, 8080, 27374/tcp
2005-04-25T09:15:00.000Z	desrt		so both 8080 and 80 are blocked.  and 22
2005-04-25T09:15:00.000Z	desrt		incoming
2005-04-25T09:15:00.000Z	desrt		you can only make outgoing connections on it
2005-04-25T09:16:00.000Z	desrt		Primal79; no.  basically, your ISP are facists :)
2005-04-25T09:16:00.000Z	Primal79	desrt	any suggestions on a port to try then?
2005-04-25T09:18:00.000Z	Primal79	desrt	no sure how to do that
2005-04-25T09:27:00.000Z	Primal79	desrt	go to  the dmz tab and enable dmz?
2005-04-25T09:28:00.000Z	Primal79	desrt	is that a smart thing to do?
2005-04-25T09:36:00.000Z	Primal79	desrt	okay i stopped firestarter firewall. would that make a difference?
2005-04-25T09:41:00.000Z	Primal79	desrt	change the listen port?
2005-04-25T09:49:00.000Z	Primal79	desrt	okay, with listen 8888 put in and firestarter turned off, i don't get the connection refused error
2005-04-25T09:55:00.000Z	Primal79	desrt	strange... the index.html shows "placeholder page" etc
2005-04-25T09:58:00.000Z	Primal79	desrt	i can already access rayandamy.dyndns.org from windows
2005-04-25T09:59:00.000Z	Primal79	desrt	how about this? i can access my ip address, but not ip address:8888
2005-04-25T10:36:00.000Z	Primal79	desrt	how about this? i can access my ip address, but not ip address:8888
