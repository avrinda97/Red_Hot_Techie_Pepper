2012-09-25T00:36:00.000Z	GlenUK		Can anyone help me solve an issue with my hard drive locking? (maybe related to /tmp folder)
2012-09-25T00:38:00.000Z	compdoc	GlenUK	what do you mean locking?
2012-09-25T00:39:00.000Z	GlenUK	compdoc	I tried installing a large application and it crashed, here is the message: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1225290/
2012-09-25T00:39:00.000Z	GlenUK	compdoc	Now I cannot install anything so I feel the whole partition is locked now
2012-09-25T00:40:00.000Z	compdoc	GlenUK	when hard drives have issues, its mounted as read-only. Open the Disk utility, and check the crive's health
2012-09-25T00:40:00.000Z	compdoc		*drive's
2012-09-25T00:41:00.000Z	GlenUK	compdoc	i assume i am going to need to restart: Device is mounted and no online capability in fsck tool for file system
2012-09-25T00:42:00.000Z	compdoc	GlenUK	what does Disk Utility say about the drive's health?
2012-09-25T00:43:00.000Z	GlenUK	compdoc	Overall assessment: Disk has a few bad sectors. further down i see: Current Pending Sector Count..... Number of sectors waiting to be remapped: 2
2012-09-25T00:43:00.000Z	compdoc	GlenUK	thats the problem. Can you click the button to open the SMART info, and read how many bad secotrs>?
2012-09-25T00:44:00.000Z	compdoc		sectors
2012-09-25T00:44:00.000Z	GlenUK	compdoc	2
2012-09-25T00:44:00.000Z	compdoc		not Current Pending Sectors, but Reallocated sectors
2012-09-25T00:44:00.000Z	GlenUK	compdoc	0
2012-09-25T00:46:00.000Z	compdoc	GlenUK	hmm, well, pending sectors mean that the drive had problems reading/writing, but it might not actaully be the drive - could be power issues, or something else. In any case, when you start having bad sectors, and the number starts to grow, its time for a new drive. You should backup your data in the mean time
2012-09-25T00:47:00.000Z	compdoc	GlenUK	and yeah, I think you just need to reboot
2012-09-25T00:47:00.000Z	GlenUK	compdoc	is there anything i can do in the mean time? perform a disk check maybe?
2012-09-25T00:47:00.000Z	compdoc	GlenUK	there are tests to run in Disk Util
2012-09-25T00:47:00.000Z	compdoc		SMART tests
2012-09-25T00:47:00.000Z	compdoc		short and long
2012-09-25T00:48:00.000Z	GlenUK	compdoc	ty
