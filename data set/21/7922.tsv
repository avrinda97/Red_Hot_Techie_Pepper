2008-05-28T02:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eduardo	Attitude and how well your question is phrased have a lot to do with how good of an answer you get..
2008-05-28T02:43:00.000Z	eduardo	Jack_Sparrow	i dont think im having a bad attitude
2008-05-28T02:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eduardo	I feel your statement was rude and offensive to the people that are here helping
2008-05-28T02:44:00.000Z	eduardo	Jack_Sparrow	yes, and i feel ofended each time i get here and nobody helps me
2008-05-28T02:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eduardo	If someone knows the answer they will help.  You are free to leave and look for the answer elsewhere
2008-05-28T02:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eduardo	You made an inflamatory statement and now complain when you get flamed.. go figure
2008-05-28T02:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eduardo	Did you even look to see if xsane sees the scanner portion of your printer
2008-05-28T02:48:00.000Z	eduardo	Jack_Sparrow	it doesnt, thats why i need to change de driver
2008-05-28T02:48:00.000Z	eduardo	Jack_Sparrow	but idk how to do it
2008-05-28T02:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eduardo	Did you read the supported hardware page to see if your printer is listed
2008-05-28T02:49:00.000Z	eduardo	Jack_Sparrow	yes, its not listed
2008-05-28T02:50:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eduardo	then the additional features are not supported and it is using the driver that will let it work as a printer only
2008-05-28T02:50:00.000Z	eduardo	Jack_Sparrow	but before my last ubuntu reinstallation it worked fine and it recognized as the model it is, idk whats going wrong now
2008-05-28T02:50:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eduardo	Hope you find an answer
2008-05-28T02:51:00.000Z	eduardo	Jack_Sparrow	thanks, do you know if theres any other way i can use the scanner?
2008-05-28T02:51:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	eduardo	nope
