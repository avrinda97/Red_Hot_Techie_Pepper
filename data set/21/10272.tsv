2005-04-20T14:46:00.000Z	alterim		i've just installed mplayer and now menueditor
2005-04-20T14:46:00.000Z	alterim		but the menueditor doesn't let me delete anything
2005-04-20T14:46:00.000Z	whiskers	alterim	where did you get menueditor
2005-04-20T14:46:00.000Z	whiskers	alterim	could you post the url
2005-04-20T14:47:00.000Z	whiskers	alterim	google doesn't find anything
2005-04-20T14:47:00.000Z	whiskers	alterim	oh it doesn't work yet
2005-04-20T14:51:00.000Z	whiskers	alterim	what url did you get that menueditor...we can legally use that in the US
2005-04-21T11:24:00.000Z	whiskers	alterim	check the preferences of your programs and is the pull from /dev/dsp or esd....if /dev/dsp try kill -9 esd
2005-04-21T11:24:00.000Z	whiskers	alterim	if they pull
2005-04-21T11:26:00.000Z	whiskers	alterim	ok...glad to hear that
2005-04-21T11:27:00.000Z	whiskers	alterim	kill -9 esd.....and to restart esd &
2005-04-21T11:28:00.000Z	whiskers	alterim	well i have found it useful on occassion
2005-04-21T11:30:00.000Z	whiskers	alterim	but if you configure your inputs for esd in your applications you don't have to bother killing anything
2005-04-21T11:30:00.000Z	whiskers	alterim	for example xmms can be configured for alsa, oss, arts,esd /etc
2005-04-21T11:31:00.000Z	whiskers	alterim	no crimsun is saying the same thing...but different wording...he knows what he is saying
2005-04-21T11:32:00.000Z	whiskers	alterim	esd sits on top of alsa/oss drivers...it is a sound server not a driver....crimsun is right
2005-04-21T11:34:00.000Z	whiskers	alterim	well i can't comment on xvid...it is a protected codec here and we are not allowed to use it
2005-04-21T11:35:00.000Z	whiskers	alterim	unfortunately i am in the US where we are screwed
2005-04-21T11:35:00.000Z	whiskers	alterim	since the US became a police state for the large corporations
2005-04-21T11:36:00.000Z	whiskers	alterim	i heard xvid uses the divx codec which i heard was proprietary and based on mpeg
