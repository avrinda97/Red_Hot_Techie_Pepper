2008-09-22T16:19:00.000Z	remu		hey guys, im trying to get my wireless working on hardy, the intel wifi link 5100, I have followed this guide before: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=879134&page=2 post 62, and gotten it to work, however, i am at school and cant plugin to ethernet right now to do "sudo apt-get install build-essential"
2008-09-22T16:20:00.000Z	remu		is there a way for me to get the required files onto my flash drive, and do it that way? since i have internet access on my vista machine, are there debs or something?
2008-09-22T16:21:00.000Z	remu		dinesh, whats the problem?
2008-09-22T16:22:00.000Z	pajamian	remu	how does your vixta machine connect?
2008-09-22T16:23:00.000Z	pajamian	remu	does it have an ethernet port on it?
2008-09-22T16:24:00.000Z	pajamian	remu	is the vista box different from the box with ubuntu, or is it the same computer?
2008-09-22T16:24:00.000Z	remu	pajamian	same machine
2008-09-22T16:25:00.000Z	pajamian	remu	ahhhh, never mind then.  If it's just 10 hours till you get home and can do it from there I would just wait until you get home.
2008-09-22T16:26:00.000Z	pajamian	remu	you can download individual packages and use dpkg to install them, but you have to know all the right dependancies, etc.
2008-09-22T16:26:00.000Z	pajamian	remu	possibly
2008-09-22T16:27:00.000Z	pajamian	remu	if you download it and try to install them dpkg will tell you what is missing.  You can do it that way, it may take a few tries, though.
2008-09-22T16:28:00.000Z	pajamian	remu	those you don't already have installed, yes.
2008-09-22T16:28:00.000Z	pajamian	remu	to install?
2008-09-22T16:29:00.000Z	pajamian	remu	sudo dpkg -i filename
2008-09-22T16:29:00.000Z	remu	pajamian	thanks
2008-09-22T16:29:00.000Z	pajamian	remu	I don't know if build essential is on the install disk, I never really paid much attention to that to be honest.
2008-09-22T16:31:00.000Z	pajamian	remu	then I'd use the CD as a repo.
2008-09-22T16:32:00.000Z	remu	pajamian	ActionParsnip, do you guys know if it is possible to add a mounted iso of the install disk as a repo?
2008-09-22T16:33:00.000Z	pajamian	remu	I would think so, but I don't know for sure.
2008-09-22T16:35:00.000Z	pajamian	remu	I would try copying the deb line in the sources.list file and changing the cdrom: to file:///path/to/mountpoint
2008-09-22T16:35:00.000Z	pajamian	remu	yes
