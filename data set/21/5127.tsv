2007-12-18T13:28:00.000Z	motin_0_	MasterShrek	once or twice a month in 1.5 years
2007-12-18T13:28:00.000Z	MasterShrek	motin_0_	you need a gpg key, from wherever you go the repo from

2007-12-18T13:28:00.000Z	motin_0_	MasterShrek	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingProgramCrash
2007-12-18T13:28:00.000Z	MasterShrek		thats not a default ubuntu repo
2007-12-18T13:29:00.000Z	motin_0_	MasterShrek	true, this is for -dbgsym packages
2007-12-18T13:29:00.000Z	motin_0_		but I can't use apport-retrace because of "gpg: Signature made Thu 04 Oct 2007 08:30:09 PM CEST using DSA key ID 0A0AC927
2007-12-18T13:29:00.000Z	motin_0_		gpg: Can't check signature: public key not found"
2007-12-18T13:30:00.000Z	MasterShrek	motin_0_	what command gives you that error?
2007-12-18T13:30:00.000Z	motin_0_	MasterShrek	 apport-retrace -o retrace.crash -v /var/crash/_usr_lib_cgi-bin_php5.2009.crash -R -u 2>&1 | tee retrace.log
2007-12-18T13:30:00.000Z	motin_0_		it tries to install dbgsym-packages, stops at pslib1-dbgsym
2007-12-18T13:31:00.000Z	MasterShrek		!source-o-matic | Zenerek
2007-12-18T13:31:00.000Z	MasterShrek	motin_0_	try to manually install those programs and try again, if you are running that original command as your normal user, it wont be able to install those pacakges
2007-12-18T13:31:00.000Z	MasterShrek		by programs, i mean packages
2007-12-18T13:32:00.000Z	motin_0_	MasterShrek	sure. that works, picking only the packages of which gpg is complaining on
2007-12-18T13:33:00.000Z	MasterShrek	motin_0_	7.10?
2007-12-18T13:33:00.000Z	motin_0_	MasterShrek	yup
