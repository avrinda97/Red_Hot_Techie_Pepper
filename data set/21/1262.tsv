2010-11-27T03:24:00.000Z	davidheinrich		hello? anyone know what t odo with hese .dsc files?
2010-11-27T03:26:00.000Z	_jesse_	davidheinrich	perhaps supply the --compile flag to to get a .deb
2010-11-27T03:27:00.000Z	davidheinrich	_jesse_	like this? sudo apt-get --download-only --compile install network-manager
2010-11-27T03:29:00.000Z	_jesse_	davidheinrich	yeah
2010-11-27T03:29:00.000Z	davidheinrich	_jesse_	when I do that, it says "Download complete and in download only mode", but I don't see anything different
2010-11-27T03:30:00.000Z	_jesse_	davidheinrich	right that's what you'd expect :) it just downloads but doesn't install it
2010-11-27T03:30:00.000Z	davidheinrich	_jesse_	I deleted the original .dsc, .diff, and .tgz files that it d/l-ed and redid it like I posted, but it just says d/l complete and in d/l only mode, and  doesn't re-get and put the files in deb format?
2010-11-27T03:30:00.000Z	davidheinrich	_jesse_	but now it isn't d/l-ing them ata ll...it thinks they're already there, eventhoughthe directory is empty!
2010-11-27T03:30:00.000Z	_jesse_	davidheinrich	you can do apt-get --no-download install package when you restart
2010-11-27T03:31:00.000Z	_jesse_	davidheinrich	I'm not sure where apt-get stores them
2010-11-27T03:31:00.000Z	davidheinrich	_jesse_	I saw the files in my home directory in LiveCD
2010-11-27T03:31:00.000Z	davidheinrich	_jesse_	it just d/led them to he working directory
2010-11-27T03:31:00.000Z	_jesse_	davidheinrich	strange, well look in /var/cache/apt/archive
2010-11-27T03:31:00.000Z	_jesse_	davidheinrich	* /var/cache/apt/archives
2010-11-27T03:32:00.000Z	davidheinrich		ahhh, here hey are! thanks!
2010-11-27T03:32:00.000Z	_jesse_	davidheinrich	np
2010-11-27T03:32:00.000Z	davidheinrich	_jesse_	so then I can just use dpkg to install hte .deb's, right?
2010-11-27T03:32:00.000Z	_jesse_	davidheinrich	yessir
2010-11-27T03:33:00.000Z	_jesse_	davidheinrich	make sure you grab all dependencies too
2010-11-27T03:33:00.000Z	davidheinrich	_jesse_	I think it was just network-manager-gnome and network-manager...I don't think any other deps were removed when I installed it...I hope
2010-11-27T03:33:00.000Z	_jesse_	davidheinrich	ah alrighty
