2006-04-17T15:50:00.000Z	sean		If I install xubuntu-desktop, will that replace anything in kubuntu-desktop? (I prefer KDM)
2006-04-17T15:50:00.000Z	mwe	sean	no
2006-04-17T15:50:00.000Z	mwe	sean	it will install xcfe4 along kde
2006-06-23T07:22:00.000Z	mwe	sean	huh? isn't evolution an email client ?
2006-06-23T07:22:00.000Z	sean	mwe	 yes
2006-06-23T07:23:00.000Z	mwe	sean	well, compose, send mail I guess
2006-06-23T07:24:00.000Z	sean	mwe	 could you please tell me how to finish it?
2006-06-23T07:25:00.000Z	mwe	sean	I dont know what you're asking exactly
2006-06-23T07:26:00.000Z	sean	mwe	problem with hotmail
2006-06-23T07:26:00.000Z	mwe	sean	well hotmail is webmail isn't it?
2006-06-23T07:26:00.000Z	sean	mwe	 I am not sure
2006-06-23T07:26:00.000Z	mwe	sean	I don't think you can configure any mail client to get your webmail, except outlook express maybe
2006-06-23T07:27:00.000Z	mwe	sean	You would set up the account like in any other client. go to hotmail.com for details I think
2006-06-23T07:28:00.000Z	sean	mwe	that means I can only read my email in web. it couldn't be download to my computer?
2006-06-23T07:28:00.000Z	mwe	sean	But IIRC outlook express has some kind of hotmail integration built in so don't follow instructoins for that
2006-06-23T07:29:00.000Z	mwe	sean	unless it has pop/imap access as well I don't know if hotmail does
2006-06-23T07:29:00.000Z	mwe	sean	gmail does
2006-06-23T07:29:00.000Z	sean	mwe	oh.that's a problem.
2006-06-23T07:30:00.000Z	mwe	sean	what is?
2006-06-23T07:30:00.000Z	sean	mwe	every time I want to read my email . I have to login hotmail's web site.
2006-06-23T07:31:00.000Z	mwe	sean	not if it provides pop3 access
