2004-12-08T10:24:00.000Z	mgoose		what sources do i need to install mplayer in ubuntu?
2004-12-08T10:25:00.000Z	lamont	mgoose	mplayer source is in multiverse.
2004-12-08T10:44:00.000Z	lamont	mgoose	what happened on try 1 and 2???
2004-12-08T10:46:00.000Z	lamont	mgoose	the vast majority of the time in a process is spent not using mmx instructions
2004-12-08T10:47:00.000Z	lamont	mgoose	xmms is in main, dunno if it's in the seed or not.
2004-12-08T10:47:00.000Z	lamont	mgoose	not seeded - you have to install it if you want it.
2004-12-08T10:49:00.000Z	lamont	mgoose	???
2004-12-08T10:49:00.000Z	lamont	mgoose	my machine is ide-only
2004-12-08T10:49:00.000Z	lamont	mgoose	what controller, etc?
2004-12-08T10:52:00.000Z	mgoose	lamont	thanks but how does that help me
2004-12-08T10:53:00.000Z	lamont	mgoose	I expect that 'fdisk /dev/hda' should be happy, no?
2004-12-08T10:54:00.000Z	mgoose	lamont	maybe its all that porn?
2004-12-08T11:00:00.000Z	mgoose	lamont	dmesg says "hda: ST3120026A, ATA DISK drive" which is correct
2004-12-08T11:00:00.000Z	lamont	mgoose	ew
2004-12-08T11:54:00.000Z	mgoose	lamont	is kde 3.3.1 even in the ubuntu repo anywhere?
2004-12-08T12:03:00.000Z	lamont	mgoose	hoary is still rather fluid... if you're willing to tolerate occasional b0rkage, then running hoary would help the developers out at least a little bit.  Then again, it can be painful to be dragged into the bleeding edge.
2004-12-08T12:01:00.000Z	lamont	mgoose	just add universe
2004-12-08T12:02:00.000Z	mgoose	lamont	same results, keeps saying kde is installed and latest, etc
2004-12-08T12:02:00.000Z	lamont	mgoose	and if that doesn't work, scream at me with package names and I'll add them to my "fix these if you're ever bored" list
2004-12-08T12:02:00.000Z	lamont	mgoose	warty or hoary?
2004-12-08T12:05:00.000Z	lamont	mgoose	but kde 3.3.1 won't be showing up in warty, ever.
