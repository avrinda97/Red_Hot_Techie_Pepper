2007-05-22T07:10:00.000Z	cjae	Flannel	free as beer ?? or free freedom

2007-05-22T07:12:00.000Z	cjae	Flannel	i c
2007-05-22T07:12:00.000Z	Flannel	cjae	http://www.gnupg.org/  theres a windows version too.
2007-05-22T07:13:00.000Z	cjae	Flannel	keyrings or passwords
2009-02-08T01:06:00.000Z	Flannel	cjae	What's that?
2009-02-08T01:09:00.000Z	cjae	Flannel	I regigtry scanner but primarily a system sweeper, cleans out temp internet files, cookies and such
2009-02-08T01:09:00.000Z	Flannel	cjae	Just use the clean temporary file thing in firefox, and then sudo apt-get autoclean
2009-02-08T01:10:00.000Z	cjae	Flannel	thought there was supposed to be some great new system cleaner in intrepid
2009-02-08T01:12:00.000Z	Flannel	cjae	There's not much to clean, package management keeps cruft down.  I haven't heard anything about that, nor do I see it: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/810overview
2009-02-08T01:13:00.000Z	cjae	Flannel	https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/intrepid-changes/2008-October/008049.html
2009-02-08T01:14:00.000Z	Flannel	cjae	Alright, so install system-cleaner and go to town; from the description it sounds like it just automates the process of removing old packages in package management.  Not cookies, etc (which makes sense)
2009-02-08T01:15:00.000Z	cjae	Flannel	was just asking, did n't know what it did, is this the same as the autoclean command?
2009-02-08T01:16:00.000Z	cjae	Flannel	I just found that link two min ago
2009-02-08T01:16:00.000Z	Flannel	cjae	no, autoclean removes old package files (the deb files), this removes old libraries that aren't required, and also the things in synaptic labeled "local or obsolete packages" (well, the obsolete part of those, anyway)
2010-09-27T04:25:00.000Z	Flannel	cjae	It's not installed by default, but it still exists.  If you have further questions about it #ubuntu+1 would be the place to ask
2010-09-27T04:26:00.000Z	cjae	Flannel	right thats what I meant was not included on the disc
