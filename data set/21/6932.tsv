2007-04-17T08:22:00.000Z	xtknight		x preserves dir structure, e does not
2007-04-17T08:22:00.000Z	xtknight		me
2007-04-17T08:24:00.000Z	xtknight		!info gambas | m4st3r
2007-04-17T08:24:00.000Z	xtknight		it is exactly like Visual basic
2007-04-17T08:24:00.000Z	xtknight		i believe the 64bit version is broken, sadly
2007-04-17T08:24:00.000Z	xtknight		yeah it does suck
2007-04-17T08:25:00.000Z	xtknight		recurse subdirectories(of what?)
2007-04-17T08:26:00.000Z	xtknight		extract .rars within a .rar?
2007-04-17T08:27:00.000Z	xtknight		just with x you would have all your folders
2007-04-17T08:29:00.000Z	xtknight		yeah it does it for you
2007-04-17T08:29:00.000Z	clever_	xtknight	you dont need to escape the spaces if your quoting the whole thing
2007-04-17T08:29:00.000Z	xtknight	clever_	hm depends on the program
2007-04-17T08:30:00.000Z	clever_	xtknight	bash will remove the ""'s and give the \ 's with the \'s to unrar as a single large arg
2007-04-17T08:30:00.000Z	xtknight	clever_	ahh
2007-04-17T08:31:00.000Z	clever_	xtknight	play with stuff like echo '\ ' and echo \  and other combinations
2007-04-17T08:31:00.000Z	clever_	xtknight	and stuff like echo *
2007-04-17T08:31:00.000Z	xtknight	clever_	so when you type "here is a spacey path"  the program is not receiving "here" "is" in separate variables?  i know on windows it combines them into one variable and sends it to the program but didnt know about linux
2007-04-17T08:32:00.000Z	clever_	xtknight	because of the quotes that entire phrase is a single argument
2007-04-17T08:32:00.000Z	xtknight	clever_	cool.  got it.
2007-04-17T08:33:00.000Z	clever_	xtknight	but if you dont put quotes there it will give each space seperated word its own arugemt
2007-04-17T08:34:00.000Z	clever_	xtknight	i played with /etc/acpi/hibernate.sh i think
