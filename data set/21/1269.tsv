2011-08-15T23:44:00.000Z	battle_warrior		hi, ive made  a total mistake.. and somehow screwed my system up totaly enough where every time i try to rewrite a text file.. it keeps saying ] I'm sorry, Dave, but I cannot let you do that.  .. the cause of my mistake?  chown -R 777 .  How do i ix this??? without using a gui.. its a server box
2011-08-15T23:45:00.000Z	battle_warrior		-_-
2011-08-15T23:46:00.000Z	avernos	battle_warrior	lol, did you issued that command as root?
2011-08-15T23:48:00.000Z	avernos	battle_warrior	777 is open for everyone? shouldnt let you do that kind of things?
2011-08-15T23:52:00.000Z	avernos	battle_warrior	that looks like you changed the owner of the files, probably to root
2011-08-15T23:53:00.000Z	avernos	battle_warrior	im just another n00b trying to help..
2011-08-15T23:55:00.000Z	battle_warrior	avernos	i apreciate your help,
2011-08-15T23:56:00.000Z	avernos	battle_warrior	:D well trying to give you some pointers, but there are probably more stuff to it
2011-08-16T00:09:00.000Z	avernos	battle_warrior	have you tried adding the users editing with sudo? :P might not be a good idea?
2011-08-16T00:09:00.000Z	battle_warrior	avernos	how?
2011-08-16T00:09:00.000Z	avernos	battle_warrior	sudo vi whilelist_file
2011-08-16T00:10:00.000Z	avernos	battle_warrior	would be the same idea as using notpad, instead of using the comand..
2011-08-16T00:11:00.000Z	battle_warrior	avernos	yeah editing the notepad directly would be a good idea.. but before i screwed it up i could access and write to the notepad from the console
2011-08-16T00:11:00.000Z	battle_warrior	avernos	its like all my permissions been borked
2011-08-16T00:11:00.000Z	avernos	battle_warrior	i would guess the group or perms, perhaps you can try to find out how to let your user edit it. but if you edit with sudo and it works then might be enough
2011-08-16T00:12:00.000Z	battle_warrior	avernos	when i run minecraft.sh it becomes the server for minecraft.. sudo commands or normal ubuntu commands dont work while i have.sh running
2011-08-16T00:13:00.000Z	avernos	battle_warrior	i dont even know what is minecraft, but try to find out what group uses, what perms the files should have, and set it to what it should be..
2011-08-16T00:16:00.000Z	avernos	battle_warrior	server is running? have you stopped and started again after the mess and works fine?
2011-08-16T00:18:00.000Z	avernos	battle_warrior	and sudo or root would get permission denied too ?
2011-08-16T00:19:00.000Z	avernos	battle_warrior	 you could open another terminal, out of minecraft.sh and use sudo/root to edit the files
2011-08-16T00:24:00.000Z	avernos	battle_warrior	sorry i dunno how the game works.. gonna get some sleep.. good luck^^
