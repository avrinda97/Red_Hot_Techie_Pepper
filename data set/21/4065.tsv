2008-08-10T19:13:00.000Z	frybye		is there a known bug with ubunto giving a wrong size for ssd storage? (eeePc here)
2008-08-10T19:13:00.000Z	bazhang	frybye	have you seen the www.eeeuser.com wiki on how to make ubuntu hardy run perfectly on that?
2008-08-10T22:45:00.000Z	bazhang	frybye	you may want to try the array.org kernel with that
2008-08-13T12:16:00.000Z	bazhang	frybye	the eeepc?
2008-08-13T12:16:00.000Z	bazhang	frybye	you seen the wiki for how to get it working perfectly?
2008-08-13T12:18:00.000Z	bazhang	frybye	after following that guide works fine here
2008-08-18T19:53:00.000Z	bazhang	frybye	the google script?
2008-10-04T15:50:00.000Z	bazhang	frybye	#ubuntu+1 for that
2008-10-04T15:51:00.000Z	frybye	bazhang	have been asking there for about 12 hours..
2008-10-04T15:51:00.000Z	bazhang	frybye	that is the correct channel not here.
2008-11-01T15:12:00.000Z	bazhang	frybye	that kernel is not supported here; contact Adam for that
2008-11-01T15:16:00.000Z	frybye	bazhang	theoretically I can understand that.. i dont think he runs an irc# though...
2008-11-01T15:17:00.000Z	bazhang	frybye	that is a completely different kernel than the one from ubuntu; fixes here wont work with his
2008-11-01T15:19:00.000Z	frybye	bazhang	on his website he claims his kernel is "very near" the generic one - but nevermind...
2008-11-01T15:19:00.000Z	bazhang	frybye	for best results I would check wiki at www.eeeuser.com
2012-02-04T05:54:00.000Z	frybye	bazhang	do me a favour - whats the thing with --startwithpc - ???
2012-02-04T05:55:00.000Z	frybye	bazhang	of course I googled first and didnt find it...
2012-02-04T05:56:00.000Z	bazhang	frybye	put in startup applications then
2012-02-04T05:57:00.000Z	frybye	bazhang	where is that in unity...?
2012-10-02T18:08:00.000Z	bazhang	frybye	lets move on
2012-10-02T18:09:00.000Z	frybye	bazhang	- I can see your point but this kid is not in line expecting help he declares is for school server hacking that can bring a school to its knees sometimes...
