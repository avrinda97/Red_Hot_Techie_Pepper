2006-10-23T15:26:00.000Z	crew		hey, quick question.. how do you reset apache2?
2006-10-23T15:26:00.000Z	Terminus	crew	sudo invoke-rc.d apache2 restart
2006-10-23T15:26:00.000Z	Terminus	crew	or do you mean reset the config to defaults?
2006-10-23T15:27:00.000Z	crew	Terminus	no your right.. just to restart it... had changed some things and they hadn't taken effect
2006-10-23T15:27:00.000Z	crew	Terminus	any difference?
2006-10-23T15:28:00.000Z	Terminus	crew	not really. invoke-rc.d is more like a wrapper script.
2006-10-23T15:29:00.000Z	Terminus	crew	put it before index.html in the Directory Index.
2006-10-23T15:30:00.000Z	Terminus	crew	is mod_php loaded? check your /etc/apache/mods-enabled/
2006-10-23T15:31:00.000Z	Terminus	crew	php4/5 should have AddType application/x-httpd-php .php .phtml .php3 in php?.conf
2006-10-23T15:31:00.000Z	crew	Terminus	confusing :S
2006-10-23T15:32:00.000Z	Terminus	crew	it should just work. tried creating index.php with <?php phpinfo(); ?> ?
2006-10-23T15:32:00.000Z	crew	Terminus	ah yeah i understand now... it does have that exact line
2006-10-23T15:33:00.000Z	crew	Terminus	what do you mean by <?php phpinfo(); ?> ?
2006-10-23T15:33:00.000Z	Terminus	crew	that should generate a webpage with the php configuration.
2006-10-23T15:36:00.000Z	Terminus	crew	it should do that if you don't put a .html file in root dir anyway.
2006-10-23T15:40:00.000Z	Terminus	crew	it should just be DirectoryIndex index.php index.html index.cgi index.pl index.xhtml
2006-10-23T15:40:00.000Z	Terminus	crew	oh... cache! hahaha
2006-10-23T15:40:00.000Z	Terminus	crew	forgot to refresh? :)
2006-10-23T15:40:00.000Z	crew	Terminus	nah i was refreshing... just using firefox under windows pc to check....
2006-10-23T15:42:00.000Z	crew	Terminus	gnomefreak, wickedpuppy, porkpie, mnepton; thank you for your help :)
2006-10-23T15:42:00.000Z	Terminus	crew	you're welcome. =)
