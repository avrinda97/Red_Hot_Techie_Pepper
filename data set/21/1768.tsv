2010-05-11T13:48:00.000Z	wesguin		is it my imagination or is lucid lynx just less stable than karmic was?
2010-05-11T13:49:00.000Z	wesguin		well it has errors and doesn't want to install on some machines karmic worked fine on
2010-05-11T13:50:00.000Z	wesguin		I never had probs with ata2 errors before and I couldn't install it on my sisters desktop at all when karmi worked a charm
2010-05-11T13:50:00.000Z	wesguin		well it *is* new and all I guess
2010-05-11T13:51:00.000Z	wesguin		lucid works pretty good in most respects on my eeepc tho
2010-05-11T13:52:00.000Z	wesguin		the UNE
2010-05-11T13:53:00.000Z	wesguin		i
2010-05-11T13:53:00.000Z	wesguin		ic
2010-05-11T13:55:00.000Z	wesguin		weird thing was the only eeebuntu that worked on this eeepc900 well was standard 2.0
2010-05-11T13:55:00.000Z	gogeta1	wesguin	most stuff that was in eebuntu is in newer linux likr ubuntu lucid
2010-05-11T13:57:00.000Z	wesguin	gogeta1	well I had everything working including applet which controlled fan, cpu, on/off for reader, bluetooth, etc.. but don't have that working on lucid
2010-05-11T13:57:00.000Z	wesguin	gogeta1	but at least the hotkeys work for acpi stuff
2010-05-11T13:57:00.000Z	gogeta1	wesguin	look up eee im sysanptic you will find eeeacpi scripts to enable all of that
2010-05-11T13:58:00.000Z	wesguin	gogeta1	I've already tried all that.. none of it works right.. some of it partially
2010-05-11T13:58:00.000Z	wesguin	gogeta1	I think the eeepc 900 is just quirky or something
2010-05-11T13:59:00.000Z	gogeta1	wesguin	900a hear
2010-05-11T13:59:00.000Z	wesguin	gogeta1	yeah I read some people had good luck with other models
2010-05-11T13:59:00.000Z	gogeta1	wesguin	well all eebuntu used was the array.org kernel maybe that will work for you
2010-05-11T14:00:00.000Z	gogeta1	wesguin	if they have a lucid build
2010-05-11T14:00:00.000Z	wesguin	gogeta1	hmm.. could be
2010-05-11T14:00:00.000Z	wesguin	gogeta1	will look into that
