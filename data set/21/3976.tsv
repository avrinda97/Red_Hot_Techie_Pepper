2008-11-20T08:57:00.000Z	binarymutant	droopsta915	is that a real copy paste?
2008-11-20T08:58:00.000Z	binarymutant	droopsta915	because it says 'settin'
2008-11-20T09:00:00.000Z	binarymutant	droopsta915	there should just be comments in /etc/X11/xinit/xinput.d/all_ALL I'll show you what mine looks like

2008-11-20T09:02:00.000Z	droopsta915	binarymutant	ill go into fail safe mode and see what i can fix, thanks
2008-11-20T09:03:00.000Z	binarymutant	droopsta915	 /etc/X11/xinit/xinput.d/all_ALL
2008-11-20T09:09:00.000Z	droopsta915	binarymutant	the file looks the same.
2008-11-20T09:10:00.000Z	binarymutant	droopsta915	? are you sure?
2008-11-20T09:11:00.000Z	binarymutant	droopsta915	what happens if you remove /ssh ?
2008-11-20T09:12:00.000Z	droopsta915	binarymutant	should i remove it from the same file?
2008-11-20T09:13:00.000Z	binarymutant	droopsta915	well don't remove it, but do you have a /ssh file or folder?
2008-11-20T09:14:00.000Z	binarymutant	droopsta915	did you add it because by default there shouldn't be one
2008-11-20T09:14:00.000Z	droopsta915	binarymutant	no i didnt
2008-11-20T09:15:00.000Z	binarymutant	droopsta915	where'd you get the disc? because that would worry me. But even so could you pastebin .xsession-errors found in your home folder?
2008-11-20T09:24:00.000Z	droopsta915	binarymutant	i cant find the error file,
2008-11-20T09:25:00.000Z	binarymutant	droopsta915	try vim ~/.xsession-errors
2008-11-20T09:26:00.000Z	binarymutant	droopsta915	it might not be there though
2008-11-20T09:26:00.000Z	binarymutant	droopsta915	honestly I would reinstall, /ssh shouldn't be there unless you put there yourself
2008-11-20T09:27:00.000Z	droopsta915	binarymutant	can someone get remote access if i didnt set it up for that?
2008-11-20T09:28:00.000Z	binarymutant	droopsta915	I'm not sure, but if thats there and you didn't create it, there could be other things wrong
