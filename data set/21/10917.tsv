2007-06-05T11:20:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ramorek	comment out that line in your /etc/apt/sources.list file
2007-06-05T11:21:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ramorek	breezy?!?!?  damn...   alt+f2, type "gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list" and add a "#" before the CDRom line that is referenced, save the file and run "sudo apt-get update" from term again
2007-06-05T11:22:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ramorek	you started with breezy?  went to dapper, then edgy?
2007-06-05T11:23:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ramorek	they didn't... just follow my advice about commenting that line
2007-06-05T11:24:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ramorek	read docs.ubuntu.com more often :)
2007-06-05T11:24:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ramorek	i meant help.ubuntu.com rather :)
2007-06-05T11:29:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ramorek	just one is necessary, but two will work as well
2007-06-05T11:29:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ramorek	probably somewhere :)
2007-06-05T11:30:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ramorek	help.ubuntu.com is a great resource... as are the forums
2007-06-05T11:33:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ramorek	probably only better... might have to get new drivers, but it's uber-easy in feisty
2007-06-05T11:38:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ramorek	upgrade ;)
2007-06-05T11:38:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ramorek	or google for it.. it's a known beryl thing with breezy
2007-06-05T11:39:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ramorek	just use metacity till you upgrade ;)
2007-06-05T11:40:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ramorek	so use vino or x11vnc or krfb
2007-06-05T11:41:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ramorek	probably... you tell me ;)
2007-06-05T11:41:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ramorek	yep... or "system -> help"
2007-06-05T11:44:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ramorek	there are... vmware, virtualbox, xen, qemu, etc.
2007-06-05T11:45:00.000Z	bur[n] er	ramorek	nope... though if ti's windows games you want... wine might work.... it plays WoW and Warcraft 3 and Starcraft and Call of Duty and more
