2009-06-27T10:02:00.000Z	ditty_kong		Andy: how did u install flash ?
2009-06-27T10:03:00.000Z	andy	ditty_kong	well, i had someone help me with commands the other day. he had me uninstall all flash related items, and reinstall adobe, etc
2009-06-27T10:04:00.000Z	andy	ditty_kong	we did this several times, he also had me manually delete them, and go through the "add/remove" feature, search flash, and install everything, but still nothing :(
2009-06-27T10:05:00.000Z	andy	ditty_kong	the thing is, youtube works, myspace video and music does not. it shows up with a grey box with an arrow inside it. i click it and it doesnt load.
2009-06-27T10:05:00.000Z	andy	ditty_kong	yeah... it stumped him as well.
2009-06-27T10:05:00.000Z	andy	ditty_kong	he gave up after roughly 2 hours...
2009-06-27T10:06:00.000Z	andy	ditty_kong	well when i go to youtube, it loads the video's on the page so it doesn't prompt me with an option of downloading it.
2009-06-27T10:06:00.000Z	andy	ditty_kong	my problem is playing video's on myspace, music on myspace, etc.
