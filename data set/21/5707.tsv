2008-08-18T03:59:00.000Z	owen1_		how do i know what packages will be added to the repositories by canonical and when?
2008-08-18T03:59:00.000Z	Flannel	owen1_	What do you mean?
2008-08-18T04:01:00.000Z	owen1_	Flannel	i installed a package with aptitude. i would like to install a newer version without compiling it (to avoid the 'dependency hell' problem).
2008-08-18T04:02:00.000Z	Flannel	owen1_	What version do you have, and what version do you want? (and what package is it?)
2008-08-18T04:03:00.000Z	owen1_	Flannel	newsbeuter. the repositories have 0.7 and i am interested in a newer one.
2008-08-18T04:03:00.000Z	owen1_	Flannel	(it's amazing rss client, text-based)
2008-08-18T04:04:00.000Z	Flannel	owen1_	0.9.1 is in Intrepid
2008-08-18T04:04:00.000Z	Flannel	owen1_	So, if you don't want to wait, you could backport that for your own personal use
2008-08-18T04:05:00.000Z	owen1_	Flannel	cool. should i use prevu?
2008-08-18T04:05:00.000Z	Flannel	owen1_	I would.  For something like that it should work without any catches as well (although I can't say for sure, can't see the depends at the moment)
2008-08-18T04:06:00.000Z	owen1_	Flannel	is there a site where i can see all this data as well? (what packages will be in the next ubuntu)
2008-08-18T04:07:00.000Z	Flannel	owen1_	packages.ubuntu.com  but the searching functionality is broken at the moment.
2008-08-18T04:07:00.000Z	owen1_	Flannel	unop thanks
2008-08-18T04:12:00.000Z	owen1_	Flannel	prevu needs at "least a few hundred megabytes of available storage under /var to function" is there a 'cheapest' way ?
2008-08-18T04:12:00.000Z	Flannel	owen1_	You only need it while its building, you can remove it afterwards
2008-08-18T04:13:00.000Z	Flannel	owen1_	(the space, and prevu too, for that matter)
2008-08-18T04:13:00.000Z	owen1_	Flannel	so aptitude remove will free it?
2008-08-18T04:13:00.000Z	Flannel	owen1_	No, since the space it takes up won't be covered by package management.  You'll just go in and  remove the directory
2008-08-18T04:14:00.000Z	owen1_	Flannel	got it. thanks
2008-08-18T05:18:00.000Z	Flannel	owen1_	You'll probably have more luck in #ubuntu-motu
2008-08-18T05:18:00.000Z	owen1_	Flannel	ok.
