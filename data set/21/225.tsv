2012-05-26T21:09:00.000Z	MagicJ		hown can I orevent the pannel popping up when I move the cursor to the left on 12.04
2012-05-26T21:11:00.000Z	LordOfTime	MagicJ	 turn up the sensitivity on the panel?
2012-05-26T21:12:00.000Z	LordOfTime		s/up/down/
2012-05-26T21:12:00.000Z	MagicJ	LordOfTime	yes - helps - but not enough - want to really stop it 100%
2012-05-26T21:12:00.000Z	LordOfTime	MagicJ	 don't use Unity then
2012-05-26T21:12:00.000Z	LordOfTime	MagicJ	 you could use gnome-shell or something
2012-05-26T21:13:00.000Z	LordOfTime		!notunity | MagicJ
2012-05-26T21:13:00.000Z	MagicJ	LordOfTime	how do I easily turn it off
2012-05-26T21:13:00.000Z	LordOfTime	MagicJ	 by not using Unity, but using gnome-shell
2012-05-26T21:14:00.000Z	LordOfTime	MagicJ	 you either have it autohide or you dont in which case it'll always be there
2012-05-26T21:14:00.000Z	LordOfTime	MagicJ	 you can change *where* it shows up (left side / bottom), but if you want it to autohide but not respond to being tapped, you might be out of luck
2012-05-26T21:15:00.000Z	MagicJ	LordOfTime	ty so much - that's how it seemed - YUCK - I will o the drop back to gnome I guess - this is the tupe of thing that will drive me and others away from Ubuntu - I have 131 sites running Ubuntu that I will probably end up changing because of this type of thing
2012-05-26T21:15:00.000Z	LordOfTime	MagicJ	 you could make it go to the bottom
2012-05-26T21:15:00.000Z	LordOfTime	MagicJ	 or just make it so its always visible and not hidden
2012-05-26T21:16:00.000Z	MagicJ	LordOfTime	my users do not want to be confused by this stuff.  They use the few things we have on the desktop and no more
2012-05-26T21:17:00.000Z	LordOfTime	MagicJ	 the dash is part of Unity.  to not have the dash, the answer  is don't use Unity, but use Gnome Shell or Gnome Classic (I am partial to gnome shell)
2012-05-26T21:17:00.000Z	MagicJ	LordOfTime	I agree - and the best way to that is to change to another distro
2012-05-26T21:17:00.000Z	LordOfTime	MagicJ	 or use Gnome Shell (which is closer to Gnome than Unity)
2012-05-26T21:17:00.000Z	LordOfTime	MagicJ	 Ubuntu's a great distro, you could use Kubuntu (KDE) if you want
2012-05-26T21:18:00.000Z	LordOfTime	MagicJ	 when i get tired of Unity, i keep KDE around :P
2012-05-26T21:18:00.000Z	MagicJ	LordOfTime	I like unity for my own development use  -but for a "packaged system" ready for the end user for whom I really want to hide that there is an OS there at all this is bo good
