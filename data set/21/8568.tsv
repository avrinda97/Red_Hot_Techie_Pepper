2006-12-20T07:56:00.000Z	kitche	wasabi_	why not make your volume louder with sudo alsamixer
2006-12-20T07:57:00.000Z	wasabi_	kitche	i tried that it's up to the max and it's lower than what it is in windows
2006-12-20T07:58:00.000Z	wasabi_	kitche	cranking master and pcm is about half as loud as it would be in windows on full
2006-12-21T11:54:00.000Z	wasabi_	kitche	that package isn't available for edgy?
2006-12-21T11:53:00.000Z	kitche	wasabi_	feisty has jre-1.5.0-10-1
2006-12-21T11:54:00.000Z	kitche	wasabi_	it might be in the backports
2006-12-21T11:55:00.000Z	wasabi_	kitche	i tried linking the java plugin in the firefox folder and firefox crashes when visiting a java enabled website. i'm using 1.5 update 10
2006-12-21T11:56:00.000Z	kitche	wasabi_	I don't even see 1.6 as being out
2006-12-21T11:57:00.000Z	wasabi_	kitche	hmm odd some bloke on the forums said it was out
2006-12-21T11:57:00.000Z	wasabi_	kitche	blah nvm
2006-12-21T11:58:00.000Z	kitche	wasabi_	on the java site they only have java 5.0 update 10 which is 1.5.0 update 10
2006-12-21T11:58:00.000Z	wasabi_	kitche	actually it is out
2006-12-21T11:59:00.000Z	wasabi_	kitche	i see it on java.sun.com
2006-12-21T11:59:00.000Z	kitche	wasabi_	ht he SDK has it but not the runtime environment
2006-12-21T11:59:00.000Z	wasabi_	kitche	runtime is there
2006-12-21T11:59:00.000Z	kitche	wasabi_	and I see why also it's java EE
2006-12-21T12:00:00.000Z	wasabi_	kitche	http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp the runtime environment is listed on there
2006-12-21T12:01:00.000Z	kitche	wasabi_	yeah it's the JDK that's why I didn't notice I was looking at the runtime environment alone
2006-12-21T12:02:00.000Z	kitche	wasabi_	think they just updated their page when I was looking at it also
