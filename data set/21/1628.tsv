2010-06-25T11:22:00.000Z	hoare		I am trying to boot ubuntu cd from grub screen. can anyone help?
2010-06-25T11:22:00.000Z	hoare		I need help about grub. please help me.
2010-06-25T11:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	hoare	Could you give more detail about your situation?
2010-06-25T11:23:00.000Z	hoare	Jordan_U	I am on grub4dos. and I have mounted CD rom. I just want to boot cd.
2010-06-25T11:23:00.000Z	hoare	Jordan_U	the cd in which kernel is at /casper/vmlinuz
2010-06-25T11:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	hoare	You can't if you're booted from the hard drive. (you could with grub2 if it were a PATA CDROM drive)
2010-06-25T11:25:00.000Z	hoare	Jordan_U	partition boot sector is now windows boot.ini and boot.ini loads my grldr (grub loader) which is grub4dos. Do I really need grub2?

2010-06-25T11:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	hoare	If you're trying to boot from a CD (rather than from an iso file), yes.
2010-06-25T11:34:00.000Z	hoare	Jordan_U	It seems I can not create g2ldr using grubinst tool.
2010-06-25T11:35:00.000Z	hoare	Jordan_U	http://diddy.boot-land.net/grub4dos/files/grldrmbr.htm here at the very end it says that it is not compatible.
2010-06-25T11:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	hoare	That guide says nothing about grub2, and "grldr" is a name specific to grub4dos, a grub2 image that's loadable from ntldr is not going to be named grldr
2010-06-25T11:38:00.000Z	hoare	Jordan_U	where can I find such a file? I am looking at the WUBI source. it has wubildr and wubildr.mbr. It boots from wubildr.mbr and it successfully finds the path to virtual disk file and boots it. I could not understand how can it be happening without any grub commands...
2010-06-25T11:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	hoare	It uses an embedded config which loop mounts the .disk file and reads the grub.cfg from there.
2010-10-12T12:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	hoare	What terminal emulator are you using?
2010-10-12T12:05:00.000Z	hoare	Jordan_U	using guake with bash.
2010-10-12T12:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	hoare	See if you can reproduce the problem with gnome-terminal / xterm.
2010-10-12T12:07:00.000Z	hoare	Jordan_U	reproduces
2010-10-12T12:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	hoare	With gnome-terminal or with xterm?
2010-10-12T12:08:00.000Z	hoare	Jordan_U	xterm
