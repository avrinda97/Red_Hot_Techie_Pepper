2012-05-30T12:39:00.000Z	wawowe	hceylan	you're trying to output sound to a microphone?
2012-05-30T12:40:00.000Z	wawowe	hceylan	i've never tried that before but you might be able to do it with cat
2012-05-30T12:41:00.000Z	wawowe	hceylan	yeah, cat /dev/input >/dev/output
2012-05-30T12:42:00.000Z	hceylan	wawowe	I got /dev/input but no /dev/output
2012-05-30T12:42:00.000Z	wawowe	hceylan	those were just examples
2012-05-30T12:42:00.000Z	hceylan	wawowe	I see :)
2012-05-30T12:43:00.000Z	wawowe	hceylan	the devices you're looking for will probably be in /dev/snd/
2012-05-30T12:43:00.000Z	hceylan	wawowe	would you happen to locate the devices, cause I cannot find for example /dev/bluetooth or /dev/bt
2012-05-30T12:43:00.000Z	hceylan	wawowe	may lsof pulseaudio shed some light?
2012-05-30T12:44:00.000Z	wawowe	hceylan	i can't tell you what they'll be named on your system but they'll most likely be in /dev/snd/ and begin with "pcm"
2012-05-30T12:44:00.000Z	wawowe	hceylan	yes it could
2012-05-30T12:45:00.000Z	hceylan	wawowe	thx
2012-05-30T12:45:00.000Z	wawowe	hceylan	lsof | grep snd
2012-05-30T12:46:00.000Z	hceylan	wawowe	obviously that won't help
2012-05-30T12:46:00.000Z	hceylan	wawowe	but thanks anyway
2012-05-30T12:47:00.000Z	wawowe	hceylan	run a program that uses your microphone
2012-05-30T12:47:00.000Z	wawowe	hceylan	and one that uses your speakers
2012-05-30T12:47:00.000Z	hceylan	wawowe	that could be interesting
2012-05-30T12:47:00.000Z	wawowe	hceylan	then lsof | grep snd
2012-05-30T12:47:00.000Z	hceylan	wawowe	l'll try that
2012-05-30T12:56:00.000Z	hceylan	wawowe	thx for help
