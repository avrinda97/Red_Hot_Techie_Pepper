2007-10-24T07:52:00.000Z	sgwizdak	Pacane	what kind of graphics driver do you have?
2007-10-24T07:53:00.000Z	Pacane	wolfjb	Ive got a laptop with an integrated card, the "Screens and graphics" thingy detects my card as Intel 945.
2007-10-24T07:55:00.000Z	Pacane		so... wolfjb and sgwizdak ? Anything for me?
2007-10-24T07:56:00.000Z	sgwizdak	Pacane	what kind of problems are you having?
2007-10-24T07:56:00.000Z	Pacane		It's not a resolution problem wolfjb
2007-10-24T07:56:00.000Z	Pacane		and sgwizdak, the thing is, when I logon
2007-10-24T07:57:00.000Z	Pacane		it says that Ubuntu has to run in low graphics mode, and then when I enable the 3d accelation (after slecting the right driver) it says that the visual effects couldnt be enabled..
2007-10-24T07:58:00.000Z	Pacane		And my drivers always get back to the default ones in the panel.
2007-10-24T07:59:00.000Z	sgwizdak	Pacane	hmm, and this is a new 7.10 install?
2007-10-24T07:59:00.000Z	Pacane		Yes it is sgwizdak
2007-10-24T07:59:00.000Z	Pacane		It is working on my job mate's Laptop (The same laptop)
2007-10-24T08:01:00.000Z	sgwizdak	Pacane	sounds like a driver issue, your best bet is to search/post to ubuntuforums.org and request help. Be sure to include the make of your laptop and all the information you can about your video card.
2007-10-24T08:01:00.000Z	Pacane		Ok
2007-10-24T08:02:00.000Z	Pacane		Thanks for your help
2007-10-24T08:02:00.000Z	sgwizdak	Pacane	no worries. some people with 945 chipsets claim everything works, and other people are having problems
2007-10-24T08:04:00.000Z	Pacane		If I log out/on, will the X server restart?
2007-10-24T08:05:00.000Z	sgwizdak	Pacane	nah, the display manager and server stay up
2007-10-24T08:05:00.000Z	sgwizdak	Pacane	only the x-session restarts
