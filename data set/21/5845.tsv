2007-07-24T14:14:00.000Z	tupa	Prophezy	KDE / GNOME / Xfce4 ??

2007-07-24T14:14:00.000Z	Prophezy		:)
2007-07-24T14:15:00.000Z	tupa	Prophezy	Photoshop + wine, ughhh, you have linux's options for professional editing images, (eg. gimp, krita)
2007-07-24T14:15:00.000Z	Prophezy		i think its a foot symbol :P
2007-07-24T14:15:00.000Z	Prophezy		Tupa : yes i have them but i not so familiar with them yet
2007-07-24T14:16:00.000Z	Prophezy		and i have to finish my work first
2007-07-24T14:16:00.000Z	Prophezy		after that i will learn Gimp
2007-07-24T14:17:00.000Z	tupa	Prophezy	ah, I don't use GNOME myself, but probably right clicking on the apps menu there's an entry to add custom commands
2007-07-24T14:17:00.000Z	tupa	Prophezy	so your custom command would be something like wine /my/path/dreamweaver.exe
