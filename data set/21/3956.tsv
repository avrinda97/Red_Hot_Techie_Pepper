2009-05-07T00:12:00.000Z	supernix		IT is kind of broad but pointed
2009-05-07T00:12:00.000Z	supernix		I just tried to test the LiveDVD of the x86 project
2009-05-07T00:13:00.000Z	supernix		this is not a install channel
2009-05-07T00:15:00.000Z	supernix		Well what the heck might as well try my hand at this
2009-05-07T00:15:00.000Z	supernix		Can't get the root terminal to work anymore since the latest system update
2009-05-07T00:15:00.000Z	supernix		installed 9.0.4 and somehow it will not allow the root terminal to run
2009-05-07T00:16:00.000Z	supernix		See no response at all
2009-05-07T00:16:00.000Z	guntbert	supernix	what do you mean by "root terminal"?, and please have a littele patience
2009-05-07T00:18:00.000Z	guntbert	supernix	ok, and what is your problem with that?
2009-05-07T00:19:00.000Z	guntbert	supernix	does gksu work for you generally?
2009-05-07T00:21:00.000Z	supernix	guntbert	actually it used to work fine when I tested it the first time
2009-05-07T00:22:00.000Z	guntbert	supernix	what happens when you type something like gksu xeyes ?
2009-05-07T00:31:00.000Z	supernix	guntbert	the command faild it did ask for a password but then nothing happened
2009-05-07T00:32:00.000Z	guntbert	supernix	ok, now try without gksu
2009-05-07T00:33:00.000Z	supernix	guntbert	yes without gksu it works fine pulls up a terminal
2009-05-07T00:35:00.000Z	supernix	guntbert	 I don't understand why there are no errors being written to the logs either
2009-05-07T00:36:00.000Z	guntbert	supernix	thats strange indeed, try gksu gnome-terminal
2009-05-07T00:37:00.000Z	supernix	guntbert	Failed to contact the GConf daemon
2009-05-07T00:38:00.000Z	guntbert	supernix	and gnome-terminal alone?
2009-05-07T00:39:00.000Z	supernix	guntbert	yes the gnome-terminal alone pops up when I issue the command
2009-05-07T00:42:00.000Z	guntbert	supernix	strange, at the moment I got no new ideas - please try gksu alone and try to start several graphical applications
