2008-06-18T09:34:00.000Z	glitsj16	extor	any luck yet getting the info you want ? http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/php5-xdebug seems very thin on specifics ..
2008-06-18T09:48:00.000Z	extor	glitsj16	no luck so far :(
2008-06-18T09:48:00.000Z	extor		I installed in and it seems to give debugging information when PHP scripts make a booboo...with orange highlighting but thats all
2008-06-18T09:49:00.000Z	glitsj16	extor	i presume it will work smoothly with apache and php, what IDE are you trying to plug it into ?
2008-06-18T09:50:00.000Z	extor	glitsj16	any IDE really..I have quanta plus installed so that would be nice if it worked there...I have no clue as to what xdebug really does and how to integrate it into IDEs yet
2008-06-18T09:52:00.000Z	glitsj16	extor	okay, it's a debugging tool, that much is clear .. the nifty thing is that it hooks right into your scripts without you having to change those (which is a real blessing) .. perhaps xdebug.org has more info on the ubuntu or linux support in general
2008-06-18T09:53:00.000Z	extor	glitsj16	don
2008-06-18T09:53:00.000Z	extor	glitsj16	don't you have to type in a line saying breakpoint() or something into your code?
2008-06-18T09:53:00.000Z	extor		yeah I am going to read their web page a bit more
2008-06-18T09:54:00.000Z	glitsj16	extor	hmm, i guess it's one of those 'try - and find -out' moments .. at least the packaged version in ubuntu op php5-xdebug is pretty recent
2008-06-18T09:56:00.000Z	glitsj16	extor	it supports remote debugging as well, hope you can get it going, it's addictive once you use it (especially the code profiler to get the heavy parts located so you can try to get those cleaner) :)
2008-06-18T09:56:00.000Z	extor	glitsj16	which IDE do you use it with?
2008-06-18T09:57:00.000Z	extor	glitsj16	check this out...this is what got me interested in xdebug: http://www.pseudocoder.com/archives/2007/04/24/how-to-really-use-xdebug-to-speed-up-your-app/
2008-06-18T09:57:00.000Z	extor		Is that how you are utilizing it also?
2008-06-18T09:57:00.000Z	glitsj16	extor	i started with a simple text editor like gedit and have tried a few but never felt at home, still using gedit with a few plugins for documentation and code-folding
2008-06-18T09:58:00.000Z	extor	glitsj16	but did you get xdebug integrated into gedit?
2008-06-18T09:59:00.000Z	glitsj16	extor	i hook it into apache and at the bottom of any script it shows the debug and profile output, i don't write overly complex php code though :)
2008-06-18T10:01:00.000Z	glitsj16	extor	there's kcachegrind on ubuntu as well if you want to go that way, everything is there
2008-06-18T10:01:00.000Z	extor	glitsj16	nice; I am going to be exploring all these tools soon
2008-06-18T10:01:00.000Z	glitsj16	extor	in case you are unfamiliar with that, it's a visualization tool to interpret bigger php apps, very handy indeed
2008-06-18T10:02:00.000Z	glitsj16	extor	yes, some reading and experimenting,, the php spirit ;)
