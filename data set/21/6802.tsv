2007-01-23T13:34:00.000Z	Cryoniq		So I can get VLC through it and I can also get libdbus-1-1 but if I try go Libdbus-1-1 it will rip out a lot of stuff with gnome in it, firefox stuff.. tons of stuff.. and I assume that means that gnome will fail if I do
2007-01-23T13:34:00.000Z	Cryoniq		because current libdbus is 1-3
2007-01-23T13:34:00.000Z	Cryoniq		vlc complain it want 1-1
2007-01-23T13:34:00.000Z	Cryoniq		to install
2007-01-23T13:35:00.000Z	Cryoniq		VLC is a very good media player, to me at least :)
2007-01-23T13:36:00.000Z	Cryoniq		yes. VLC is more than a media player since it has a lot with streaming etc also
2007-01-23T13:37:00.000Z	Cryoniq		it is strange though that libdbus 1-3 isnt backwards compatible with 1-1
2007-01-23T13:37:00.000Z	Cryoniq		or rather.. that VLC doesnt assume that higher versions is compatible
2007-01-23T13:38:00.000Z	Cryoniq		=) I did.. they told me.. take that up with your distro people and channels :D
2007-01-23T13:38:00.000Z	Cryoniq		There is.. it is that one im trying to install :D
2007-01-23T13:38:00.000Z	jrib	Cryoniq	and what is the problem?  What error do you get?
2007-01-23T13:39:00.000Z	jrib	Cryoniq	pastebin your sources.list
2007-01-23T13:44:00.000Z	jrib	Cryoniq	put your /etc/apt/sources.list file's contents on that website
2007-02-01T06:08:00.000Z	Cryoniq	jrib	I guess I am lacking (dont hit me please now) the structure tree and drag and drop files easy around without using cut and paste moving files :)
2007-02-01T06:08:00.000Z	jrib	Cryoniq	maybe try gnome-commander
2007-02-01T06:09:00.000Z	Cryoniq	jrib	ah :)
2007-02-12T08:37:00.000Z	jrib	Cryoniq	yes windows will overwrite grub when you install it, see:
2007-02-12T08:39:00.000Z	jrib	Cryoniq	what windows apps do you need?
2007-03-16T05:02:00.000Z	jrib	Cryoniq	gnome 2.18 is not available on the stable releases
2007-03-16T05:05:00.000Z	jrib	Cryoniq	yes
