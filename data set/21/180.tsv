2012-06-27T22:40:00.000Z	Jagst3r15		is there a list of programs maintained by canonical, like libreoffice?
2012-06-27T22:40:00.000Z	Jagst3r15		Like a comprehensive list
2012-06-27T22:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jagst3r15	libreoffice is maintained by The Document Foundation
2012-06-27T22:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jagst3r15	to the ubuntu OS, yes they package it and ensure it gels with the rest. but the app itself is maintained upstream
2012-07-16T02:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jagst3r15	yes if the video chip gets 3D drivers out of the box
2012-07-16T02:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jagst3r15	the GPU is the chip on the card. The actual card itself is irrelevant, you just need the chip
2012-07-17T04:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jagst3r15	you could disable to repo then install packages, you can use /var/log/dpkg.log to see what was recently installed
2012-07-17T04:20:00.000Z	Jagst3r15	ActionParsnip	says last updates were in april but i just installed ubuntu tday?
2012-07-17T04:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jagst3r15	so the last lines at the bottom say april?
2012-07-17T04:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jagst3r15	the ones installed most recently will be the ones you installed from backports, you can reinstall those packages
2012-07-17T04:32:00.000Z	Jagst3r15	ActionParsnip	well the thing is I don't want the backports there ;) but you think it eats up any memory having them installed anyway (if they were - I can't really tell if they were but I assume that they were)
2012-07-17T04:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jagst3r15	doesn't eat up memory at al..
2012-08-03T05:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jagst3r15	what is the output of:  lsb_release -sc
2012-08-03T05:28:00.000Z	Jagst3r15	ActionParsnip	how do I properly purge this ppa? sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/rhythmbox
2012-08-03T05:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jagst3r15	you will need to remove rhythmnbox with the PPA added, then remove the ppa then install rhythmnbox
2012-08-03T05:30:00.000Z	Jagst3r15	ActionParsnip	so remove it from by clicking remove in the USC then purge the PPA?
2012-08-03T05:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jagst3r15	sounds good, or you can use apt-get , either is fine
2012-08-03T05:37:00.000Z	Jagst3r15	ActionParsnip	ty for the help
2012-08-15T18:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jagst3r15	run:  top      what is the highest use of CPU?
2012-08-15T18:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jagst3r15	no, what is the name of the app
2012-08-15T18:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Jagst3r15	kill the browser then rerun it
