2008-10-28T14:07:00.000Z	proteusguy		How can I tell exactly what version of ubuntu I'm running? I've got a 64bit AMD cpu but not sure if I'm running 32 or 64bit Ubuntu.
2008-10-28T14:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	proteusguy	lsb_release -a
2008-10-28T14:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	proteusguy	you downloaded it, surely you know what architecture your linux is
2008-10-28T14:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	proteusguy	also uname -a will tell you (i686 = 32bit, X86_64 == 64bit)
2008-10-28T14:08:00.000Z	proteusguy	ActionParsnip	- Doesn't say if I'm 32 or 64 bit. I didn't install it which is why I'm trying to find out.
2008-10-28T14:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	proteusguy	can you paste the output of uname -a here, i'll tell you
2008-10-28T14:09:00.000Z	proteusguy	ActionParsnip	uname -a says Linux vai 2.6.24-21-generic #1 SMP Tue Oct 21 23:43:45 UTC 2008 i686 GNU/Linux. Does the i686 mean my CPU or the build's bitwidth?
2008-10-28T14:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	proteusguy	32bit
2008-10-28T14:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	proteusguy	i686
2008-10-28T14:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	proteusguy	if its a desktop pc then 32bit is fine
2008-10-28T14:10:00.000Z	proteusguy	ActionParsnip	thanx. that explains why it's only seeing 3GB out of my 6GB RAM.
2008-10-28T14:11:00.000Z	proteusguy	ActionParsnip	can I upgrade to 64 bit without rebuilding the whole machine?
2008-10-28T14:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	proteusguy	you need a whole new setup
2008-10-28T14:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	proteusguy	as your apps will be 64bit too
2008-10-28T14:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	proteusguy	for stability id hit a 64bit OS as much as you can
2008-10-28T14:12:00.000Z	proteusguy	ActionParsnip	I don't really need 64bit apps, just the kernel to get my RAM right?
2008-10-28T14:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	proteusguy	you can run 32bit apps on a 64bit kernel
2008-10-28T14:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	proteusguy	right
2008-10-28T14:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	proteusguy	if you dont like it you can always change
2008-10-28T14:16:00.000Z	proteusguy	ActionParsnip	yeah that's what i figure. the install isn't removing any packages so I presume this will all be selectable via grub.
2008-10-28T14:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	proteusguy	just follow the guide. ive never done it myself
