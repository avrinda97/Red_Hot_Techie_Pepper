2011-05-17T22:10:00.000Z	A_J		hey all I have an Issue. When I leave my comp on for extended periods. Mostly when i move the mouse or press a few keys the login window comes up, asking for password. Sometimes Though it does not just showing a black screen with the mouse pointer. Any Idea What Can Be Doing This ?
2011-05-17T22:11:00.000Z	A_J		oh yu guntbert

2011-05-17T22:14:00.000Z	qin	A_J	I guess your screenserver is locking screen down, if this is your question.
2011-05-17T22:16:00.000Z	A_J	qin	 yes. But it happenes sometimes not always
2011-05-17T22:17:00.000Z	qin	A_J	test screenserver (there is button preview or something).
2011-05-17T22:18:00.000Z	qin	A_J	*screensaver, ups
2011-05-17T22:18:00.000Z	A_J	qin	i did.. But The Problem i Get is when display goes to sleep,. Upon resuming i don't get a window to type a password (Sometimes)
2011-05-17T22:21:00.000Z	qin	A_J	Ok, and if not asking for password, what then, back in gnome?
2011-05-17T22:23:00.000Z	qin	A_J	So hibernation/ssupend problem, is it lappy?
2011-05-17T22:23:00.000Z	A_J	qin	no desktop
2011-05-17T22:24:00.000Z	qin	A_J	make cycle for hibernate and for suspend, see which is bad and disable it.
2011-05-17T22:24:00.000Z	qin	A_J	Also demsg for both
2011-05-17T22:26:00.000Z	qin	A_J	sorry, dmesg
