2010-09-10T03:54:00.000Z	AndrewMC	Aviram	try the steps listed on this website: http://cybernetnews.com/install-and-enable-restricted-drivers-in-ubuntu/
2010-09-10T03:55:00.000Z	AndrewMC	Aviram	from the looks of it if you enable those things in the software sources you can enable your gfx driver
2010-09-10T03:58:00.000Z	Aviram		I have same settings as him, AndrewMC .
2010-09-10T03:59:00.000Z	AndrewMC	Aviram	in software sources?
