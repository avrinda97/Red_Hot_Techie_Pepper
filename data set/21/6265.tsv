2008-08-03T17:00:00.000Z	AndyB		Apache not working could anyone help?
2008-08-03T17:01:00.000Z	Enselic	AndyB	what is wrong?
2008-08-03T17:02:00.000Z	AndyB	Enselic	Its installed but localhost wont load. It is running. i have restarted, reinstalled.. the process is running it is set to listen on 80, the error log has nothing. I have no idea why it wont work
2008-08-03T17:02:00.000Z	Enselic	AndyB	what happends when you go to http://localhost ?
2008-08-03T17:03:00.000Z	Enselic	AndyB	times out? how long does that take?
2008-08-03T17:04:00.000Z	AndyB	Enselic	Not sure, i clicked it when you sent that message and its till "connecting to localhost" normally 30 - 60 seconds
2008-08-03T17:05:00.000Z	Enselic	AndyB	does    netstat --listen --inet   tell you that your computer listens for traffic on port 80?
2008-08-03T17:06:00.000Z	AndyB	Enselic	No, not listening on 80
2008-08-03T17:06:00.000Z	Enselic	AndyB	so then the server is not properly running
2008-08-03T17:07:00.000Z	Enselic	AndyB	when you said "it is running", what do you ase that on?
2008-08-03T17:08:00.000Z	Enselic	AndyB	have you edited any config files after you installed?
2008-08-03T17:09:00.000Z	AndyB	Enselic	Ive added ServerName localhost but thats it
2008-08-03T17:09:00.000Z	Enselic	AndyB	I'm no Apache expert, but that sounds fishy to me. Revert that and see if that helps
2008-08-03T17:10:00.000Z	Enselic	AndyB	an Ubuntu install of apache should enable to you go to http://localhost without any configuration
2008-08-03T17:10:00.000Z	AndyB	Enselic	I have, no difference, except now i get an error on load "Could not find servername, using 127.0.1.1 instead"
2008-08-03T17:11:00.000Z	Enselic	AndyB	??? you have 127.0.1.1 as localhost?
2008-08-03T17:11:00.000Z	Enselic	AndyB	what does grep localhost /etc/hosts give you?
2008-08-03T17:12:00.000Z	Enselic	AndyB	can you ping localhost?
2008-08-03T17:14:00.000Z	Enselic	AndyB	have you been messing with your network system?
2008-08-03T17:15:00.000Z	Enselic	AndyB	right... :)
2008-08-03T17:16:00.000Z	Enselic	AndyB	I gtg now, but the problem you should fix first is enabling resolving localhost
