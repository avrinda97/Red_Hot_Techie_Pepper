2008-01-09T23:34:00.000Z	Chousuke	osx5	not any more difficult than on Debian
2008-01-09T23:34:00.000Z	Chousuke	osx5	a newbie shouldn't really be building packages.
2008-01-09T23:34:00.000Z	Chousuke	osx5	"aim"?
2008-01-09T23:35:00.000Z	Chousuke	osx5	uh
2008-01-09T23:35:00.000Z	Chousuke	osx5	that doesn't sound like free software.
2008-01-09T23:36:00.000Z	Chousuke	osx5	there's no source there.
2008-01-09T23:36:00.000Z	Chousuke	osx5	only binary packages.
2008-01-09T23:37:00.000Z	Chousuke	osx5	it's already made for you
2008-01-09T23:37:00.000Z	Chousuke	osx5	but you don't want aim
2008-01-09T23:37:00.000Z	Chousuke	osx5	it looks horrible and outdated. install pidgin instead.
2008-01-09T23:38:00.000Z	Chousuke	osx5	use the package manager. though I'd recommend pidgin
