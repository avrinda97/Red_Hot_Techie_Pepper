2009-01-21T19:00:00.000Z	homy		Hi! How can I stream music (mp3) from my ubuntu box to the wii using the lan? (and the wii web browser channel)?
2009-01-21T19:02:00.000Z	Deany	homy	bit OTT maybe but try apache and musicindex module
2009-01-21T19:03:00.000Z	homy	Deany	what do you mean with OTT?
2009-01-21T19:05:00.000Z	Deany	homy	 heres a very old guide i knocked up...  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=202837
2009-01-21T19:06:00.000Z	homy	Deany	does it stream with flash? Because otherwise the wii can't play it
2009-01-21T19:07:00.000Z	Deany	homy	ahh.. not flash no..
2009-01-21T19:07:00.000Z	homy	Deany	but doesn it work with the wii?
2009-01-21T19:07:00.000Z	Deany	homy	 make a vidiscript server
2009-01-21T19:09:00.000Z	Deany	homy	i dont know if it will work with the wii no.. (musicindex) it just displays your music nicely as a webpage where you click on and it streams it to your assigned music player.
2009-01-21T19:09:00.000Z	homy	Deany	wait a moment, I'll try the vidiscript live demo with the wii...
2009-01-21T19:13:00.000Z	homy	Deany	yes, it only has the opera browser. (And the game channel, mii channel, shop channel, weather channel and news channel).
2009-01-21T19:14:00.000Z	Deany	homy	guess vidiscript is the best/only way then...  got my own setup of that too :)
2009-01-21T19:14:00.000Z	homy	Deany	can it also stream mp3 files? Do you have it working with the wii
2009-01-21T19:16:00.000Z	homy	Deany	does that mean I have to upload every mp3 file manually? Can I just point it to a directory on the server on which it is installed that contains all the music?
2009-01-21T19:17:00.000Z	homy	Deany	ok, so that doesn't make any sense. I mean, I'd have to upload hundreds of songs manually.
2009-01-21T19:20:00.000Z	homy	Deany	yes. I also tried openening a playlist, mp3 or flv via the web browser but it said unsupported format. And java isn't supported either, only flash.
2009-01-21T19:21:00.000Z	homy	Deany	there are some windows programs that stream to the wii (somehow encoding-on-the fly), but, well, they're not for linux/ubuntu.
2009-01-21T19:36:00.000Z	homy	Deany	you still there?
2009-01-21T19:37:00.000Z	Deany	homy	yes but i dont have any idea other than VLC like he said
2009-01-21T19:37:00.000Z	homy	Deany	how vlc?
2009-01-21T19:38:00.000Z	homy	Deany	does it supply a web interface?
