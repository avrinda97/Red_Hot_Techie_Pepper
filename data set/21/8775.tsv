2009-03-04T08:05:00.000Z	horndog	leeroy	What ports do you what open?
2009-03-04T08:08:00.000Z	horndog	leeroy	Do you have a router set to DHCP?
2009-03-04T08:09:00.000Z	horndog	leeroy	do you have your ports forwarded in the router?
2009-03-04T08:11:00.000Z	horndog	leeroy	 are using your computer as a server?
2009-03-04T08:13:00.000Z	horndog	leeroy	No. I mean is  your game setup as a server or just a single player?
2009-03-04T08:14:00.000Z	horndog	leeroy	You don't need ports open to play as a single player
2009-03-04T08:15:00.000Z	horndog	leeroy	 Still, you don't need ports open to play online. Only so serve
2009-03-04T08:16:00.000Z	horndog	leeroy	 I do it all the time with UT2004
2009-03-04T08:18:00.000Z	horndog	leeroy	That is the front end to IPtables and you can open ports with firestarter
2009-03-04T08:20:00.000Z	horndog	leeroy	What game are you playing?
2009-03-04T08:21:00.000Z	horndog	leeroy	 Is there a master server for that game?
2009-03-04T08:23:00.000Z	horndog	leeroy	 Apparently firestarter is no on topic on this channel
2009-03-04T08:23:00.000Z	horndog	leeroy	not
