2007-08-31T13:06:00.000Z	shiester_miester		so yeah...the file-system is mounted as read only, i can still log in and use terminal and everything
2007-08-31T13:06:00.000Z	shiester_miester		i just need to rename it back
2007-08-31T13:06:00.000Z	shiester_miester		except that when i try to do that, it says that it can't because its a "read-only file system"
2007-08-31T13:07:00.000Z	shiester_miester		i know that its quite easy to fix, i just don't know /how/ to fix it :P
2007-08-31T13:07:00.000Z	shiester_miester		ext3, plus my 2 ntfs partitions
2007-08-31T13:08:00.000Z	shiester_miester		this "wallpapoz" program looks pretty cool...
2007-08-31T13:08:00.000Z	shiester_miester		thx for the link, urthmover
2007-08-31T13:08:00.000Z	shiester_miester		(even though I know it wasn't for me)
2007-08-31T13:08:00.000Z	shiester_miester		so anybody know how to rename a file when the file system is mounted as read-only, or how to make it so that its writeable?
2007-08-31T13:10:00.000Z	savvas	shiester_miester	you can't do anything while it's read-only, you can unmount with the umount command
2007-08-31T13:10:00.000Z	shiester_miester	savvas	but then if its unmounted then I won't be able to rename the file, right?
2007-08-31T13:11:00.000Z	savvas	shiester_miester	you unmount and mount it again with write priviledge :)
2007-08-31T13:11:00.000Z	savvas	shiester_miester	are we talking about ntfs here?
2007-08-31T13:11:00.000Z	shiester_miester	savvas	we are talking about me needing to rename /etc/fstab.bak
2007-08-31T13:12:00.000Z	savvas	shiester_miester	not going to happen if you mounted the partition as read-only
2007-08-31T13:12:00.000Z	shiester_miester	savvas	i did no such thing...if that's happend then it did it by itself
2007-08-31T13:12:00.000Z	savvas	shiester_miester	then you have errors in your partitions :)
2007-08-31T13:12:00.000Z	shiester_miester	savvas	no I don't, i renamed the file system table file
2007-08-31T13:12:00.000Z	savvas	shiester_miester	you can do the renaming from a live cd, it's easier
2007-08-31T13:13:00.000Z	shiester_miester	savvas	wonton, both good ideas.  I'll go with wontons because it's faster to just reboot in ubuntu than from the livecd
