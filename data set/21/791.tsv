2011-06-19T13:50:00.000Z	FireStorms		Hey!
2011-06-19T13:51:00.000Z	FireStorms		Wondering, if I access somebody's Ubuntu box through SSH at their root director....... will they have access to my files if they do do know my password???
2011-06-19T13:51:00.000Z	FireStorms		do not*
2011-06-19T13:52:00.000Z	wols	FireStorms	rephrase. this time with more sense.
2011-06-19T13:54:00.000Z	FireStorms	wols	what part didn't make sense?
2011-06-19T13:55:00.000Z	wols	FireStorms	sarcasm is not a good way when you want answers.
2011-06-19T13:56:00.000Z	FireStorms	wols	ok wols for you I'll dumb it down...  If I access somebody's Linux box through SSH (/) will they in turn be able to access some files on my system if they do not know password?
2011-06-19T13:56:00.000Z	wols	FireStorms	calling people "dumb" when you want answers from them is utterly moronic. but you still did it. makes one wonder. have a nice day
2011-06-19T13:57:00.000Z	FireStorms	wols	yeah well, I know people here aren't dumb, I just don't like you attitude.
2011-06-19T13:57:00.000Z	wols	FireStorms	stop digging
2011-06-21T13:22:00.000Z	wols	FireStorms	maybe Trash is versioned now for some reason or other. svn is a good as choice as any then
2011-06-21T13:25:00.000Z	FireStorms	wols	it would be a good idea if it let me delete files. I delete them subversion brings them straight back
2011-06-21T13:25:00.000Z	wols	FireStorms	you can empty your Trash, no?
2011-06-21T13:25:00.000Z	wols	FireStorms	I mean that being able to bring deleted stuff back is the point of Trash, me thinks
2011-06-21T13:26:00.000Z	FireStorms	wols	I mean if I navigate to that directory I posted and do CTRL+A and DEL they'll disappear for a second and then come back
2011-06-21T13:27:00.000Z	wols	FireStorms	use your GUI to empty the trash. it has a nice dialog for it somewhere
2011-06-21T13:44:00.000Z	wols	FireStorms	https://launchpad.net/~fingerprint/+archive/fingerprint-gui
2011-06-21T14:04:00.000Z	wols	FireStorms	it's insecure anyways
2011-06-21T14:05:00.000Z	wols	FireStorms	all they need is a glass you used to dring frm
2011-06-21T14:07:00.000Z	FireStorms	wols	hmmm point taken, I've seen enough films to know that trick - guess I'll have to start wearing gloves all the times, beats typing a password like you losers
2011-06-21T14:08:00.000Z	wols	FireStorms	I used it on my thinkpad with windows (no support for linux for the device) but it wasn't great
