2006-05-13T07:42:00.000Z	Forgott3n		IDE1 Partition #1 is a 3.8Gb partition thats FAT32 and I have no idea what it does....
2006-05-13T07:43:00.000Z	Forgott3n		whoa, so for 2gbs of ram, I should have 1gb of swap
2006-05-13T07:43:00.000Z	Forgott3n		ok
2006-05-13T07:45:00.000Z	Forgott3n		so #1 3.8gb is core windows, #2 26.8gb (C:/) is my windows hd, and #5 26.6gb is my to-be linux hd (D:/)... and I should make a forth partition? 1gb for swap right? 1/2 of current RAM
2006-05-13T07:46:00.000Z	Forgott3n		ok
2006-05-13T07:46:00.000Z	Forgott3n		hold. going to try it
2006-05-13T07:47:00.000Z	Forgott3n		oh and fyi D:/ (#5) aka to-be linux is a logical driver while the other two are primary, is this ok?
2006-05-13T07:47:00.000Z	Forgott3n		ok
2006-05-13T07:48:00.000Z	Forgott3n		how do I make a forth partition?
2006-05-13T07:48:00.000Z	Forgott3n		Im all very scared of loosing my data, so forgive the redundant questions
2006-05-13T07:48:00.000Z	slackern	Forgott3n	have you had a look at gparted?
2006-05-13T07:49:00.000Z	Forgott3n		ok...
2006-05-13T07:49:00.000Z	slackern	Forgott3n	I recommend you to make a backup of all your data to be 100% certain to keep it though.
2006-05-13T07:49:00.000Z	Forgott3n	slackern	I have, but you know ;)
2006-05-13T07:50:00.000Z	slackern	Forgott3n	just 2 days ago i was resizing /dev/sda1 and it trashed a couple of other partitions :)
2006-05-13T07:50:00.000Z	slackern	Forgott3n	I couldn't even cfdisk/fdisk the disc afterwards but i could mount the devices and get 99% of the data back :)
2006-05-13T07:50:00.000Z	Forgott3n		ok, so delete partion #5 (linux) recreate it the same but instead of capacity 26.6 make it 25.6... then create another partition making it 1 and that is the swap?
2006-05-13T07:51:00.000Z	Forgott3n		alright
2006-05-13T07:51:00.000Z	Forgott3n		hold.
2006-05-13T07:51:00.000Z	slackern	Forgott3n	I can make a screenshot for you
2006-05-13T07:52:00.000Z	slackern	Forgott3n	oh well i guess you'll manage anyhow :)
