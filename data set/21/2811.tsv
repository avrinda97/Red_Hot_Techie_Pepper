2009-07-15T01:15:00.000Z	fwaokda		how can I install ubuntu-amd64.iso to my thumbdrive in ubuntu-i386 ?
2009-07-15T01:16:00.000Z	ascheel	fwaokda	I recommend you don't use ubuntu-amd64.iso, I recommend you download the ubuntu installer meant for thumb drives and memory sticks
2009-07-15T01:16:00.000Z	fwaokda	ascheel	what u mean?
2009-07-15T01:16:00.000Z	ascheel	fwaokda	.iso files are CD images, meant to burn to a CD.
2009-07-15T01:17:00.000Z	fwaokda	ascheel	where do i find the other iso for thumb drive then?
2009-07-15T01:18:00.000Z	fwaokda	ascheel	btw I'm installing it to a pc just via thumb drive... if that matters?
2009-07-15T01:18:00.000Z	ascheel	fwaokda	stand by.  It won't be a .iso file.
2009-07-15T01:19:00.000Z	fwaokda	ascheel	mgolisch , the usb startdisk creator in ubuntu wont solve putting the iso to my usb drive for me?
2009-07-15T01:20:00.000Z	ascheel	fwaokda	this will make it easy:  http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download-netbook
2009-07-15T01:20:00.000Z	fwaokda	ascheel	but i dont want the netbook remix version
2009-07-15T01:21:00.000Z	ascheel	fwaokda	I understand that.  Follow the link the other fellow gave you for creating a boot disk.
2009-07-15T01:21:00.000Z	ascheel	fwaokda	an iso file will ONLY allow you to burn it to a CD, not to a USB device.  It's not quite as easy getting it to a USB Device, but it *IS* possible
2009-07-15T01:22:00.000Z	fwaokda	ascheel	well it seems very easy using the ubuntu tool by going to "System>Admin>Usb startup disk creator" ...
2009-07-15T01:22:00.000Z	ascheel	fwaokda	that's true, but that won't have the USB installer on it
2009-07-15T01:23:00.000Z	fwaokda	ascheel	whats the usb installer?
2009-07-15T01:23:00.000Z	ascheel	fwaokda	repeat that, fwaokda?  I don't understand what you're asking.
2009-07-15T01:24:00.000Z	fwaokda	ascheel	you said "...that won't have the USB installer on it" I asked what is the "USB installer" your talking about.
2009-07-15T01:24:00.000Z	ascheel	fwaokda	sorry, I meant that won't have the Ubuntu Installer.  I made a typo, I apologize
2009-07-15T01:25:00.000Z	fwaokda	ascheel	hmm ok
2009-07-15T01:25:00.000Z	fwaokda	ascheel	thanks
2009-07-15T01:26:00.000Z	ascheel	fwaokda	you're welcome
