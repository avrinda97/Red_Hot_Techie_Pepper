2005-05-29T13:24:00.000Z	amonkey		how can i figure out the pyhsical drive number of a drive is?
2005-05-29T13:25:00.000Z	hondje	amonkey	what do you mean?
2005-05-29T13:26:00.000Z	amonkey	hondje	i'm trying to install grub and i need to know what it's hdx,y number is
2005-05-29T13:26:00.000Z	hondje	amonkey	oh, then anto9us's idea is good, fdisk -l
2005-05-29T13:29:00.000Z	amonkey	hondje	anto9us: fdisk -l doesn't show anything, i'm running it from the shell in the ubuntu install disk
2005-05-29T13:29:00.000Z	hondje	amonkey	are you putting it on your master hdd?
2005-05-29T13:30:00.000Z	amonkey	hondje	the problem was that originally ubuntu installed grub on a storage hd, not my ubuntu hd. i removed the storage drive and now i need to put grub on my ubuntu drive
2005-05-29T13:30:00.000Z	hondje	amonkey	oh, that's rough
2005-05-29T13:31:00.000Z	amonkey	hondje	any ideas?
2005-05-29T13:31:00.000Z	hondje	amonkey	doesn't the installer show you during partitioning where /boot is?
2005-05-29T13:32:00.000Z	hondje	amonkey	If you have windows on your master hdd, and ubuntu on your slave, then the odds are that you'll have /boot on /dev/hdb1
2005-05-29T13:34:00.000Z	amonkey	hondje	i don't have windows at all, there are two storage drives on a pci ide card, and the main drive is on sata, comes up as a scusi device
2005-05-29T13:34:00.000Z	hondje	amonkey	oh, that's funky...did the partitioner give you a clue at all?
2005-05-29T13:34:00.000Z	amonkey	hondje	in the ubuntu installer, the sata drive comes up as (0,0,0), with an ext3 partition and a swap partition. no boot partition (is there supposed to be one?)
2005-05-29T13:35:00.000Z	hondje	amonkey	unless you make a boot partition, it boots off your root paritition
2005-05-29T13:35:00.000Z	amonkey	hondje	root being the ext3 partition?
2005-05-29T13:35:00.000Z	hondje	amonkey	yeah, the first one on your hdd
2005-05-29T13:36:00.000Z	amonkey	hondje	so the drive number is 0? all the install says is that it's (0,0,0) (sda)
2005-05-29T13:37:00.000Z	hondje	amonkey	I don't know the grub syntax
2005-05-29T13:43:00.000Z	amonkey	hondje	i think the guide was written for a different version of the ubuntu install disk because i follow it exactly and it says that i don't have certain commands
2005-07-26T12:45:00.000Z	amonkey	hondje	negative. aol's browser makes it the definite winrar for worst isp
