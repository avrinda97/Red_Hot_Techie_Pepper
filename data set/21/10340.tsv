2005-04-02T15:38:00.000Z	GnuKemist	kkathman	hello
2005-04-02T15:39:00.000Z	GnuKemist	kkathman	have you checked the wiki?
2005-04-02T15:40:00.000Z	GnuKemist	kkathman	and what exactly is wrong?
2005-04-02T15:42:00.000Z	GnuKemist	kkathman	did you add the appropriate domain name to the smb.conf file?
2005-04-02T15:42:00.000Z	GnuKemist	kkathman	yup
2005-04-02T15:43:00.000Z	GnuKemist	kkathman	smbpasswd or something like that
2005-04-02T15:44:00.000Z	GnuKemist	kkathman	no prob...  I've been using it for a while and still need to check things online every now and then
2005-04-02T15:44:00.000Z	GnuKemist	kkathman	you have to set it up yourself
2005-04-02T15:45:00.000Z	GnuKemist	kkathman	it will create a password for the user you're logged as
2005-04-02T15:47:00.000Z	GnuKemist	kkathman	which part is it hanging?
2005-04-02T15:47:00.000Z	GnuKemist	kkathman	smbpasswd -a username
2005-04-02T15:47:00.000Z	GnuKemist	kkathman	change username to your username
2005-04-02T15:51:00.000Z	GnuKemist	kkathman	you may have to restart samba... someone correct me here
2005-04-02T15:52:00.000Z	GnuKemist	kkathman	/etc/init.d/samba restart
2005-04-02T15:52:00.000Z	GnuKemist	kkathman	not sure if the spelling is correct... am not at the pc right now
2005-04-02T15:53:00.000Z	GnuKemist	kkathman	cool
2005-04-02T15:53:00.000Z	GnuKemist	kkathman	yup
2005-04-02T15:56:00.000Z	GnuKemist	kkathman	another silly thing (it's happened to me before) is to make sure your linux box is not named the same as your windowz
2005-04-02T15:57:00.000Z	GnuKemist	kkathman	I spent several hours one day trying to connect to a friend's server from my laptop... it had the same name as mine
2005-04-02T15:58:00.000Z	GnuKemist	kkathman	yup
