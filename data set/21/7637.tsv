2006-09-29T06:41:00.000Z	tiede		So back to my question: I have a set of games (The xmpuzzles package to be exact) and although the appear in the debian menu entry, they won't open unless i type them in a terminal. How do I go about making them behave correctly? Any Ideas?
2006-09-29T06:41:00.000Z	zyclop	tiede	wich window manager do you use?
2006-09-29T06:43:00.000Z	zyclop	tiede	well, i know next to nothing about gnome, but you should check the menu file for errors
2006-09-29T06:44:00.000Z	zyclop	tiede	or check the menu with whatever application you use to edit your menu
2006-09-29T06:46:00.000Z	zyclop	tiede	well, check out the xmpuzzles entry
2006-09-29T06:49:00.000Z	zyclop	tiede	how about a desktop icon?
2006-09-29T06:50:00.000Z	zyclop	tiede	yeah, check the menu-entry
2006-09-29T06:52:00.000Z	zyclop	tiede	what exactly is the command for the entry?
2006-09-29T06:54:00.000Z	zyclop	tiede	does that entry work if you run it on the terminal?
2006-09-29T06:56:00.000Z	zyclop	tiede	the exact entry copied directly into the terminal?
2006-09-29T06:57:00.000Z	zyclop	tiede	hmmm
2006-09-29T06:59:00.000Z	tiede	zyclop	I copied and pasted it to the terminal just to make sure a i wasn't accidently fixing it while typing. It runs from the terminal, but won't open in the menu. The same game. quite fishy.
2006-09-29T07:00:00.000Z	zyclop	tiede	my last suggestion would be to check the "run in terminal" box
2006-09-29T07:02:00.000Z	zyclop	tiede	does it work when invoked with a desktop icon?
2006-09-29T07:05:00.000Z	tiede	zyclop	It won't open from a desktop icon neither... hmm
2006-09-29T07:06:00.000Z	zyclop	tiede	does it work with some other window manager?
2006-09-29T07:09:00.000Z	zyclop	tiede	how far would you go for that game?
2006-09-29T07:12:00.000Z	zyclop	tiede	wait, maybe they are designed for xfce
2006-09-29T07:13:00.000Z	zyclop	tiede	that would explain quite a bit
2006-09-29T07:15:00.000Z	zyclop	tiede	well, we reached the end of my knowledge. I have no idea what is going on
2006-09-29T07:16:00.000Z	zyclop	tiede	well, the developers might want to know about this
