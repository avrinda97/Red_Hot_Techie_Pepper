2007-07-26T14:24:00.000Z	chrisellis		how do you use HD space for video ram ?
2007-07-26T14:25:00.000Z	chrisellis		oh its not
2007-07-26T06:06:00.000Z	chrisellis		which is the best agp or pci ?
2007-07-26T06:07:00.000Z	Eagleray	chrisellis	for graphics?
2007-07-26T06:07:00.000Z	Eagleray	chrisellis	PCIe > AGP > PCI
2007-07-26T06:08:00.000Z	Eagleray	chrisellis	all modern new ones, yes
2007-07-26T06:08:00.000Z	Eagleray	chrisellis	the graphics slot should be a PCIe x16
2007-07-26T06:10:00.000Z	Eagleray	chrisellis	yes, they look different
2007-07-26T06:11:00.000Z	Eagleray	chrisellis	modern mobos will usually supply PCIe x16 slots (1 or 2), PCIe x1 (several) and PCI (1 or more)
2007-07-26T06:12:00.000Z	Eagleray	chrisellis	just look at the mobo, you will be able to see them
2007-07-26T06:12:00.000Z	Eagleray	chrisellis	the PCIe slots look different, and the x1 slots are very short
2007-07-26T06:12:00.000Z	Eagleray	chrisellis	PCIe slots will usually be close to the CPU than the PCI ones
2007-07-26T06:12:00.000Z	Eagleray	chrisellis	*closer
2007-07-26T06:13:00.000Z	Eagleray	chrisellis	can you also direct your messages please?
2007-07-26T06:13:00.000Z	Eagleray	chrisellis	then it's not a new mobo
2007-07-26T06:14:00.000Z	Eagleray	chrisellis	most IRC clients, if you start typing a name, pressing TAB will automatically complete it
2007-07-26T06:14:00.000Z	chrisellis	Eagleray	so in my case agp would be the best vid card
2007-07-26T06:14:00.000Z	Eagleray	chrisellis	yes
2007-07-26T06:16:00.000Z	chrisellis	Eagleray	k one more question would you happen to know what the oldest nvidia card is that has vga and dvi?
2007-07-26T06:16:00.000Z	Eagleray	chrisellis	unfortunately no sorry
2007-07-26T06:16:00.000Z	chrisellis	Eagleray	no big thank you
