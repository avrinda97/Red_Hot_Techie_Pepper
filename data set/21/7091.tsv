2007-03-04T15:52:00.000Z	zac1		How do I install a modem
2007-03-04T15:53:00.000Z	gyaresu	zac1	adsl or dialup ?
2007-03-04T15:53:00.000Z	gyaresu	zac1	any linux experience?
2007-03-04T15:53:00.000Z	zac1	gyaresu	yes
2007-03-04T15:54:00.000Z	gyaresu	zac1	Is the dialup modem internal or external?
2007-03-04T15:54:00.000Z	zac1	gyaresu	internal ISA
2007-03-04T15:55:00.000Z	gyaresu	zac1	It _might_ work but will probably suck.
2007-03-04T15:55:00.000Z	zac1	gyaresu	how will it suck?
2007-03-04T15:56:00.000Z	zac1	gyaresu	yes
2007-03-04T15:56:00.000Z	gyaresu	zac1	most internals are winmodems. external ones are hardware modulator/demodulators.
2007-03-04T15:56:00.000Z	gyaresu	zac1	winmodem (software based)
2007-03-04T15:56:00.000Z	zac1	gyaresu	it is from 1995
2007-03-04T15:57:00.000Z	gyaresu	zac1	what's the lscpi line for the modem?
2007-03-04T15:58:00.000Z	zac1	gyaresu	what is lcspi line
2007-03-04T16:00:00.000Z	gyaresu	zac1	command 'lspci' lists pci devices so you can find out what the modem is _really_
2007-03-04T16:01:00.000Z	zac1	gyaresu	it is not PCI, it is ISA.
2007-03-04T16:01:00.000Z	gyaresu	zac1	forget about it. It is too old. Trust me. Don't argue. Run away from it screaming.
2007-03-04T16:02:00.000Z	gyaresu	zac1	You've got a PII huh?
2007-03-04T16:02:00.000Z	zac1	gyaresu	you mean it won't work?
2007-03-04T16:02:00.000Z	gyaresu	zac1	That would be a more literal interpretation. Yes.
2007-03-04T16:07:00.000Z	zac1	gyaresu	very badly
