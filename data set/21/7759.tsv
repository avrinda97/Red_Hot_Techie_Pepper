2006-11-14T17:59:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	MukiEX	cedega is behind wine
2006-11-14T17:59:00.000Z	MukiEX	Ash-Fox	: really o_o
2006-11-14T17:59:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	MukiEX	yes, it's been that way for ages
2006-11-14T06:00:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	MukiEX	to take money
2006-11-14T06:00:00.000Z	MukiEX	Ash-Fox	: I'm not sure why (maybe it's the lack of a .wine folder), but wine gives me a bunch of unhandled page faults when I try to run it in Edgy on a fresh install.

2006-11-14T06:02:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	MukiEX	doubt it
2006-11-14T06:03:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	MukiEX	yeah, add the one on http://www.winehq.org/site/download-deb
2006-11-14T06:04:00.000Z	MukiEX	Ash-Fox	: Woah, I already added that one o_0 Most recent addition to my sources.list too.
2006-11-14T06:04:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	MukiEX	well, there was a update to wine I didn't test today... let me see if it works
2006-11-14T06:05:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	MukiEX	the latest binary from there is working perfectly
2006-11-14T06:06:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	MukiEX	does 'wine winecfg' work?
2006-11-14T06:08:00.000Z	MukiEX	Ash-Fox	: I started a new session, which means I was running w/o any 2D/3D accelleration, and FINALLY, wine runs just fine.
2006-11-14T06:09:00.000Z	MukiEX	Ash-Fox	: I think the latest Ati drivers fubar wine.
2006-11-14T06:09:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	MukiEX	wine should work generally :/
2006-11-14T06:09:00.000Z	MukiEX	Ash-Fox	: Yeah, it should, but there's no reason I should be getting unhandled faults in a non-accellerated session.
2006-11-14T06:11:00.000Z	MukiEX	Ash-Fox	: It does seem to be Ati : http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=1715155&postcount=7
