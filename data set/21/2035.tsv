2010-02-08T10:46:00.000Z	j-A_son		my BIOS is factory default already... I'm pretty sure I just need a driver.
2010-02-08T10:46:00.000Z	mneptok	j-A_son	for what?
2010-02-08T10:46:00.000Z	mneptok	j-A_son	wireless?
2010-02-08T10:49:00.000Z	mneptok	j-A_son	run "lspci -vvv" and see if the Ethernet device is listed there. if it is not, then you have BIOS or hardware issues.
2010-02-08T10:52:00.000Z	j-A_son	mneptok	it list ethernet controller, but I still have no idea how to get it to work. Thanks for your help
2010-02-08T10:53:00.000Z	mneptok	j-A_son	"cat /etc/network/interfaces" and tell me if you see eth0 or eth1
2010-02-08T10:53:00.000Z	mneptok	j-A_son	do NOT paste results to the channel
2010-02-08T10:54:00.000Z	mneptok	j-A_son	when you ran lspci, who makes the Ethernet chipset?
2010-02-08T10:56:00.000Z	j-A_son	mneptok	I think Intel
2010-02-08T10:57:00.000Z	mneptok	j-A_son	i doubt it's Intel. 99% of Intel wired network stuff "just works" in Linux.
2010-02-08T10:58:00.000Z	mneptok	j-A_son	do you have the Live CD/DVD around?
2010-02-08T10:59:00.000Z	mneptok	j-A_son	boot off that and see if the Ethernet interface works. if it does, something you configured on the installed system is causing the issue.
2010-02-08T11:00:00.000Z	j-A_son	mneptok	it's a fresh install- it didn't work off the live CD before either. Should I try again? Thanks for your time.
2010-02-08T11:01:00.000Z	mneptok	j-A_son	desktop or laptop?
2010-02-08T11:01:00.000Z	mneptok	j-A_son	examine the BIOS carefully. ensure the network interface is active.
2010-02-08T11:01:00.000Z	j-A_son	mneptok	Dell Dimension 8250, desktop
2010-02-08T11:02:00.000Z	j-A_son	mneptok	it's on the factory default settings- I'm not really sure what I can do
2010-02-08T11:04:00.000Z	j-A_son	mneptok	it worked before with the same settings- but when I removed and reinstalled ubuntu it stopped working
2010-02-08T11:05:00.000Z	mneptok	j-A_son	which release? Live or installed?
2010-02-08T11:06:00.000Z	j-A_son	mneptok	it worked with 8.10, but then I reinstalled ubuntu 9.10 from disk to overwrite everything. I was going to give the computer to my scout troop, but I ended up keeping it for some home networking usage; now it's just not connecting to anything.
2010-02-08T11:07:00.000Z	mneptok	j-A_son	if you are donating it, try 8.04 on it. it's an LTS release. 9.10 is not.
