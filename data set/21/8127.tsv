2006-11-10T07:27:00.000Z	Shaezsche		Fsck died with an exit error of 1 right before it finished my /home partition. what does that mean???
2006-11-10T07:29:00.000Z	Shaezsche		must i wait for 30 boots to do a fsck, can i initiate it?
2006-11-10T07:29:00.000Z	sethk	Shaezsche	there is a flag on shutdown that forces a check at the next boot
2006-11-10T07:29:00.000Z	sethk	Shaezsche	you can also boot the live cd and check it that way.
2006-11-10T07:30:00.000Z	sethk	Shaezsche	if you like, you can set the number 30 to 10, or 5, or 1
2006-11-10T07:30:00.000Z	sethk	Shaezsche	depends on the error.
2006-11-10T07:30:00.000Z	sethk	Shaezsche	the flag on shutdown i -F.       shutdown -F now
2006-11-10T07:30:00.000Z	sethk	Shaezsche	you set/change the number with tune2fs
2006-11-10T07:31:00.000Z	sethk	Shaezsche	the fsck error?  it doesn't say anything other than error 1?
2006-11-10T07:31:00.000Z	Shaezsche	sethk	it says fsck died due to an error of exit 1
2006-11-10T07:32:00.000Z	sethk	Shaezsche	it has to say something before that.  well, it doesn't _have_ to, but I've never seen it only say exit 1.
2006-11-10T07:32:00.000Z	sethk	Shaezsche	fsck itself crashed, then
2006-11-10T07:32:00.000Z	sethk	Shaezsche	try booting the live cd and running fsck from there.
2006-11-10T07:33:00.000Z	sethk	Shaezsche	sounds like you might have a mismatch.  that's why I tell everyone not to do that (and get roundly abused for saying so ...)
2006-11-10T07:33:00.000Z	Shaezsche	sethk	can i fix it?
2006-11-10T07:33:00.000Z	sethk	Shaezsche	of course your problem may not have anything to do with that,
2006-11-10T07:34:00.000Z	Shaezsche	sethk	what is a mismatch
2006-11-10T07:34:00.000Z	sethk	Shaezsche	say a configuration file intended for use with one version of a program but being used by another.
2006-11-10T07:34:00.000Z	Shaezsche	sethk	cant i just go on my ./home parition and delete all the files with a . before them?
2006-11-10T07:35:00.000Z	sethk	Shaezsche	sure, you can.  I would rename the, not delete them
2006-11-10T07:35:00.000Z	sethk	Shaezsche	mkdir dot-files
