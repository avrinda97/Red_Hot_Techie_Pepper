2010-09-10T11:20:00.000Z	mobasher		gasull>> can you mount it
2010-09-10T11:21:00.000Z	mobasher		mkdir /media/sda1     then   mount /dev/sda1 /media/sda1
2010-09-10T11:23:00.000Z	mobasher		gasull>> goto grub and check the device.map against menu.lst
2010-09-10T11:25:00.000Z	mobasher		gasull>> what's in the grub ?

2010-09-10T11:03:00.000Z	gasull	mobasher	how do I check my boot settings? what is the boot up file creation?
2010-09-10T11:05:00.000Z	gasull	mobasher	how?  I'm running the install Live CD right now.
2010-09-10T11:07:00.000Z	gasull	mobasher	I would need to mount my hard drive first, right_
2010-09-10T11:08:00.000Z	gasull	mobasher	I don't think my hard drive is even mounted
2010-09-10T11:09:00.000Z	gasull	mobasher	/media is empty
2010-09-10T11:09:00.000Z	gasull	mobasher	fdisk -l shows nothing
2010-09-10T11:10:00.000Z	gasull	mobasher	I guess I should say that my hard drive is encrypted, but as far as I know that doesn't encrypt /boot
2010-09-10T11:11:00.000Z	gasull	mobasher	"no such file or directory" with cat /boot/device.map
2010-09-10T11:13:00.000Z	gasull	mobasher	cat /boot/grub/device.map: "no such file or directory"
2010-09-10T11:15:00.000Z	gasull	mobasher	chownmount: fdisk /dev/sda and then pressing m should show the partitions in disk, right?
2010-09-10T11:20:00.000Z	gasull	mobasher	yes
2010-09-10T11:22:00.000Z	gasull	mobasher	here we are
2010-09-10T11:26:00.000Z	gasull	mobasher	http://pastebin.com/KeQADRhd
2010-09-10T11:27:00.000Z	gasull	mobasher	can it be because I have my hard drive encrypted with LUKS:
