2006-09-10T10:00:00.000Z	sethk		mYth[SeNtiX] , you can stop the users from being able to run ps
2006-09-10T10:00:00.000Z	sethk		mYth[SeNtiX] , and then create your own ps that shows only processes for the current user
2006-09-10T10:00:00.000Z	sethk		mYth[SeNtiX] , any process has the x (execute) permission for user, group, and other
2006-09-10T10:01:00.000Z	sethk		mYth[SeNtiX] , if you do  chmod o-x /bin/ps,  that means that ps can only be run by the owner, and people in the owner's group
2006-09-10T10:01:00.000Z	sethk		mYth[SeNtiX] , you can also do chmo g-x /bin/ps, and that takes it away from members of the group
2006-09-10T10:01:00.000Z	sethk		mYth[SeNtiX] , so you can control what programs any user can run
2006-09-10T10:01:00.000Z	rukuartic	sethk	But then you'd have to knock out top and pstree aswell
2006-09-10T10:01:00.000Z	sethk	rukuartic	probably not, because they call ps
2006-09-10T10:02:00.000Z	sethk	rukuartic	but in general, you are right, if there are multiple programs, you have to set up each one
2006-09-10T10:02:00.000Z	sethk	rukuartic	you could remove x permission on the /usr/bin or /bin directory  :)
2006-09-10T10:03:00.000Z	rukuartic	sethk	Whee! Now nobody will be able to see _anything_.
2006-09-10T10:03:00.000Z	sethk	rukuartic	I didn't say you should, only that you could  :)
2006-09-10T10:04:00.000Z	rukuartic	sethk	I've always wondered what happens if a normal user runs rm -rf /... its not like they'd delete everything, but some files with +rwx on everyone...
2006-09-10T10:04:00.000Z	sethk	rukuartic	remember that if the user doesn't have x permission on a directory, he can't see files within that directory regardless of permissions
2006-09-10T10:05:00.000Z	sethk	rukuartic	so it depends.  whatever, the result would definitely be bad  :)
2006-09-10T10:06:00.000Z	rukuartic	sethk	So you need to have a directory with group/other +w to delete files?
2007-05-09T06:27:00.000Z	sethk	rukuartic	it's caused by a programming error, attempting to access an invalid address
2007-05-09T06:27:00.000Z	rukuartic	sethk	Ah good. No I have no idea whats causing it. Bad memory maybe? Run the memtest on it?
2007-05-09T06:28:00.000Z	rukuartic	sethk	Ah whoop.
2007-05-09T06:28:00.000Z	sethk	rukuartic	can't hurt to run the memory test.  if it's hardware, then, sure, run the memory test.
