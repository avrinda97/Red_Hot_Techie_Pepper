2008-11-23T09:28:00.000Z	c0d3-r3d		nice to see people get ignored when they ask a question
2008-11-23T09:28:00.000Z	c0d3-r3d		everyone is helping one person
2008-11-23T09:29:00.000Z	c0d3-r3d		I dont know the chmod command thats why im here so i can chmod it. My main account that i use cant write to /usr/share/themes so we think something got changed hence why i need the chmod

2008-11-23T09:31:00.000Z	Dr_willis	c0d3-r3d	 you need to use the 'recursive' option.
2008-11-23T09:30:00.000Z	Dr_willis	c0d3-r3d	 a normal user is not suppoed to be installing themes there.. they can have their own .themes directroy
2008-11-23T09:32:00.000Z	Dr_willis	c0d3-r3d	 that was a rather.. vague statement. :)
2008-11-23T09:32:00.000Z	Dr_willis	c0d3-r3d	 using the normal gnome file manager as a user...  - a user cant alter system locations...
2008-11-23T09:38:00.000Z	Dr_willis	c0d3-r3d	 you mean what 'desktop' you are using? what did you select on the login screen from the sessions menu?
2008-11-23T09:39:00.000Z	Dr_willis	c0d3-r3d	 themes are divided  into various parts, the widget set, the window decoration, icons,   and so on..
2008-11-23T09:39:00.000Z	Dr_willis	c0d3-r3d	 you can customuize the themes and mixx/match what parts you wish to use..  the theme just defines a 'set' of parts thats designed to work together.
2008-11-23T09:40:00.000Z	Dr_willis	c0d3-r3d	 it could a goofed up theme then.. custmize it and set the style to be that one manually
2008-11-23T09:47:00.000Z	Dr_willis	c0d3-r3d	 gnome is the default desktop for Ubuntu
2008-11-23T09:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	c0d3-r3d	 thats just a web site.. theres a lot of hemes in the package manager not installed by default if you want more themes.. thers also  a tool or 2 to download/install gnome themes from gnome-look.org
2008-11-23T09:49:00.000Z	Dr_willis	c0d3-r3d	 time to learn some Ubuntu Basics....  synaptic is the gui to the apt package manager system,
