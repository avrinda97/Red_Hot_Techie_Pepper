2006-11-19T08:17:00.000Z	achillez		hi guys - quick question - i added the 1400x1050 resolution to the xorg.conf but it is not showing up in the GUI resolution options - any idea why?
2006-11-19T08:18:00.000Z	steffl	achillez	did you restart X already?
2006-11-19T08:19:00.000Z	achillez	steffl	yah
2006-11-19T08:19:00.000Z	achillez		I did gdm stop / start
2006-11-19T08:19:00.000Z	achillez		it's almost as if xorg.conf has no effect
2006-11-19T08:20:00.000Z	steffl	achillez	press ctrl + alt + backspce to verify it really restarts...
2006-11-19T08:20:00.000Z	achillez		k be back then
2006-11-19T08:31:00.000Z	achillez		ok still have same problem - can't seem to get resolution 1400x1050
2006-11-19T08:31:00.000Z	achillez		xorg.conf file lists it as an option - but the Ubuntu GUI does not
2006-11-19T08:33:00.000Z	achillez		under what circumstances would Xorg not follow what's listed in the xorg.conf file?
2006-11-19T08:35:00.000Z	steffl	achillez	if there is a mistake in the config
2006-11-19T08:37:00.000Z	achillez	steffl	is there anyway to tell if there is a mistake in the config?
2006-11-19T08:37:00.000Z	achillez		any logs or anything?
2006-11-19T08:38:00.000Z	steffl	achillez	maybe in the xorg logs
2006-11-19T08:39:00.000Z	steffl		but your Problem also could be also another thing
2006-11-19T08:41:00.000Z	achillez	steffl	I think this is because my ati driver is not reporting what's in the xorg.conf
2006-11-19T08:41:00.000Z	achillez		in the log file it says: (WW) RADEON(0): Mode 1400x1050 is out of range.
2006-11-19T08:44:00.000Z	achillez	steffl	going to try re-install of latest driver
2006-11-19T08:44:00.000Z	achillez		maybe it'll help
2006-11-19T08:44:00.000Z	achillez		ladnexem: I was going to run beryl on my ati card - there are probs?
2006-11-19T08:45:00.000Z	steffl	achillez	I am not shure were the problem lays
