2005-12-21T16:11:00.000Z	runevi		Hmpfh.  Why is 'unrar' nonfree?  Is 'rar' patented?  If not, why isn't there any free implementations yet? :)
2005-12-21T16:12:00.000Z	runevi		licencing or patenting?
2005-12-21T16:13:00.000Z	runevi		I probably should.  it would be cool to implement a free verson :)
2005-12-21T16:15:00.000Z	runevi		Seems that the source code for RAR is distributed, but under a licence which forbids reverse engineering.
2005-12-21T16:15:00.000Z	runevi		Wonder how much work it would be for a decent hacker to reverse engineneer from binary, and for someone else to implement it.
2005-12-21T16:17:00.000Z	runevi		Personally I prefer KDE .. it's just so nice, has all the features I've enjoyed in other WM's, and so forth
2005-12-21T16:17:00.000Z	runevi		.. hmm.. possibly except one.  Afterstep had a wonderfull feature .. that you could scroll from one desktop to the next.
2005-12-21T16:17:00.000Z	runevi		.. and stop inbetween.
2005-12-21T16:18:00.000Z	runevi		that one I miss.  Except for that one, KDE fills all my needs. :)
2005-12-21T16:18:00.000Z	pozdiy	runevi	I believe FVWM also has a virtual desktop
2005-12-21T16:18:00.000Z	runevi	pozdiy	Yeah, it does.  Problem is, I don't _like_ FVWM. :-/
2005-12-21T16:18:00.000Z	runevi	pozdiy	While I _love_ KDE. :-)
2005-12-21T16:19:00.000Z	pozdiy	runevi	OK
2005-12-21T16:37:00.000Z	pozdiy	runevi	dpkg-reconfigure mdadm ?
2005-12-21T16:37:00.000Z	runevi	pozdiy	Well, no.
2005-12-21T16:37:00.000Z	runevi	pozdiy	The kernel I _can_ boot with doesn't have drivers that recognize the sata-controllers.
2005-12-21T16:37:00.000Z	pozdiy	runevi	sorry then
2005-12-21T16:37:00.000Z	runevi	pozdiy	The kernel I _cannot_ boot with recognized the sata-controllers .. ubuntu tries to use the drive, and the box hangs.
2005-12-21T16:38:00.000Z	runevi	pozdiy	It's probably a configuration file I just need to remove a line from.
2005-12-21T16:38:00.000Z	runevi	pozdiy	Or a rcX.d script I need to remove from a runlevel.
2005-12-21T16:38:00.000Z	runevi	pozdiy	But I'm fscked if it just checks the disk for an md-partition and goes bust if the partition is bust.
