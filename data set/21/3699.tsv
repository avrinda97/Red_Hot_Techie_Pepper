2008-10-20T00:15:00.000Z	\Kira		how can I add a user to the sudoers file from the command line?
2008-10-20T00:15:00.000Z	jrib	\Kira	why?  Just add the user to the 'admin' group to give him sudo rights
2008-10-20T00:16:00.000Z	\Kira	jrib	ActionParsnip : That works, thanks
2008-11-05T07:21:00.000Z	jrib	\Kira	getent passwd, or maybe 'ls /home' depending on what you want it for
2008-11-05T07:22:00.000Z	\Kira	jrib	is there anyway to find out what permissions they have aswell? I can run sudo\
2008-11-05T07:23:00.000Z	jrib	\Kira	was he in the output from my first command?
2008-11-05T07:24:00.000Z	jrib	\Kira	sudo -l  will give the permissions for the invoking user, not sure what you mean
2008-11-05T07:24:00.000Z	\Kira	jrib	one sec, gotta make a pastebin for the command output
2008-11-05T07:25:00.000Z	\Kira	jrib	im trying to find out the information of a user that the system says exists, but has no home dir
2008-11-05T07:25:00.000Z	jrib	\Kira	gentent passwd
2008-11-05T07:26:00.000Z	\Kira	jrib	okay, i see. Yeah, thats exactly what I was looking for. Thanks
2008-11-05T07:27:00.000Z	jrib	\Kira	deluser, make sure you want to remove him...
2008-11-05T07:27:00.000Z	\Kira	jrib	positive, thanks
2008-11-05T07:57:00.000Z	jrib	\Kira	groups
2008-11-05T07:58:00.000Z	\Kira	jrib	just the command "groups"?
2008-11-05T07:58:00.000Z	jrib	\Kira	or 'groups USER' if you aren't logged in as the user
2008-11-05T07:58:00.000Z	\Kira	jrib	thanks, your really being my source for information today :)
2008-12-19T08:35:00.000Z	jrib	\Kira	xchat is in the repositories
2008-12-19T08:36:00.000Z	\Kira	jrib	is it? opps..... I assumed since the website didnt have a ubuntu option it wouldnt be in the respritories. Thanks
2008-12-19T08:37:00.000Z	jrib	\Kira	yep.  By the way, you wanted 'sudo apt-get install build-essential'
2008-12-19T08:38:00.000Z	\Kira	jrib	okay, thanks :) It wasnt my fault, I blame the dude on the forums :D. Im guessing using build essential wouldnt work for a source download, though. Right?
