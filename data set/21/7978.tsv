2006-06-13T12:36:00.000Z	Bot_Builde1		its taken me about 10 minutes to find the OO bug report
2006-06-13T12:36:00.000Z	Bot_Builde1		and you need to register
2006-06-13T12:38:00.000Z	Bot_Builde1		Why can't I save to my USB drive?
2006-06-13T12:38:00.000Z	Bot_Builde1		I save the file, and it says its there in nautilus
2006-06-13T12:38:00.000Z	Bot_Builde1		i unplug the usb, replug, its gone
2006-06-13T12:39:00.000Z	Bot_Builde1		dont tell me i need sudo privleges
2006-06-13T12:39:00.000Z	Bot_Builde1		thats just great - someone should build a sudo checkbox into the filesaver
2006-06-13T12:41:00.000Z	Bot_Builde1		actually, when i put the usb drive back in, the file i saved before is 0 bytes
2006-06-13T12:42:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Bot_Builde1	you should unmount it properly. right click on it on the desktop and click eject device....
2006-06-13T12:43:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Bot_Builde1	It's not written synchronously because of limited flash write operations.
2006-06-13T12:43:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Bot_Builde1	Sort of, you still get "remove device safely".... I have opened up a spec on this, but nobody has warmed up to it , http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SyncMount
2006-06-13T12:44:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Bot_Builde1	Well, limited writes are not such  problem after all. They can do at LEATS 2 * 10^5 writes from what I read, with the number being closer to 10^6. But fat partitions are so awful that it would probably break sooner or later.
2006-06-13T12:45:00.000Z	Bot_Builde1	neutrinomass	very cool
2006-06-13T12:45:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Bot_Builde1	Quite unlikely for Edgy. What has been approved AFAIK is http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UnmountNotifications :)
2006-06-13T12:46:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Bot_Builde1	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AutoUnmountNotifications , wrong link previously
2006-06-13T12:47:00.000Z	Bot_Builde1	neutrinomass	Actually, I liked the first one better - if you remove it without unmounting it warns you
2006-06-13T12:48:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Bot_Builde1	My spec was about removing the need to unmount altogether. Spec's spec is about notifying (mine was the first, Spec's is the AutoUnmountNotification)
2006-06-13T12:48:00.000Z	Bot_Builde1	neutrinomass	ah
2006-06-13T12:48:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Bot_Builde1	I would push the spec if I could get numbers as to the reliability of flash devices, but no such information exists ( that can be truly trusted, that is )
2006-06-13T12:49:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Bot_Builde1	goodnight :)
