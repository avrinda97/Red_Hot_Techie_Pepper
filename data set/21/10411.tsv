2006-06-15T16:30:00.000Z	Seveas	harry	ehrm, canceling upgrade is not a good idea
2006-06-15T16:31:00.000Z	harry	Seveas	i'm going to cancel it because i have to go for awhile. but i'm still planning to continue it afterwards....
2006-06-15T16:31:00.000Z	harry	Seveas	i just dont want to leave the computer ON
2006-06-15T16:32:00.000Z	Seveas	harry	as long as it's only downloading it's safe to cancel. If it's already installing, you should *NOT* cancel it
2006-06-15T16:35:00.000Z	harry	Seveas	its says downloading and installing
2006-06-15T16:35:00.000Z	Seveas	harry	then you'd better not shut it down
2006-06-15T16:36:00.000Z	harry	Seveas	maybe they should develop something like what if it suddenly cancelled or everything went black out then the system could recover
2006-06-15T16:37:00.000Z	Seveas	harry	it takes a few commands to recover but you really should avoid having to do that
2006-06-15T16:37:00.000Z	harry	Seveas	i give up you win.. i'll just wait for a little while
2006-06-15T16:38:00.000Z	harry	Seveas	well its says here 29 min left
2006-06-15T16:38:00.000Z	Seveas	harry	hmm, it should only say that when downloading
2006-06-15T16:40:00.000Z	harry	Seveas	giv me the url for paste bin of ubuntu
2006-06-15T16:40:00.000Z	harry	Seveas	yes
2006-06-15T16:41:00.000Z	harry	Seveas	here http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/15760
2006-06-15T16:42:00.000Z	Seveas	harry	that's still downloading, you can cancel that and resume when you get back
2006-06-15T16:43:00.000Z	harry	Seveas	how do i cancel it..???
2006-06-15T16:43:00.000Z	harry	Seveas	no such button appears that says cancel....
2006-06-15T16:43:00.000Z	harry	Seveas	ok tnx
2006-09-18T11:46:00.000Z	Seveas	harry	that would work
