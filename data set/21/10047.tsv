2005-10-12T10:07:00.000Z	josh43		Ok, what is the best multi-threaded newsgroup reader for linux?
2005-10-12T10:07:00.000Z	nalioth	josh43	dunno best, but pan works good
2005-10-12T10:10:00.000Z	nalioth	josh43	you after a binary friendly reader? try pan
2005-10-12T10:10:00.000Z	nalioth	josh43	then use pan
2005-10-12T10:11:00.000Z	josh43	nalioth	Yeah, I am going to definately try it, tho I think I did before and it was a little old and crusty
2005-10-12T10:11:00.000Z	nalioth	josh43	i use it every day (movies, music, etc) and it works well
2005-10-12T10:12:00.000Z	josh43	nalioth	Does it work with yenc and all that new 'stuff'?
2005-10-12T10:12:00.000Z	nalioth	josh43	yup
2005-10-12T10:12:00.000Z	josh43	nalioth	Ok, cool.. I'm just setting it up now
2005-10-12T10:52:00.000Z	josh43	nalioth	Thanks
2005-10-19T05:45:00.000Z	nalioth	josh43	it's all about clock cycles
2005-10-19T06:22:00.000Z	nalioth	josh43	applications > system tools > new login
2005-10-19T06:23:00.000Z	josh43	nalioth	That's how they are logged in, but somthing is choking the cpu, so I want to force them out gracefully withouy switching
2005-10-19T06:23:00.000Z	nalioth	josh43	as dooglus points out, kill all their processes
2005-11-04T08:23:00.000Z	nalioth	josh43	what are you trying to do?
2005-11-04T08:24:00.000Z	josh43	nalioth	Trying to get all my MX700 mouse buttons configured by using (and apparently having to compile) 'evdev'
2005-11-04T08:24:00.000Z	nalioth	josh43	we dont use xf86 on hoary or breezy
2005-11-04T08:25:00.000Z	nalioth	josh43	you might install these
2005-11-04T08:27:00.000Z	josh43	nalioth	thanks - I dont suppose you know if it will cack if I compile it with XF86, but am running xorg?
2005-11-04T08:27:00.000Z	nalioth	josh43	install those files ubotu sent you and try again
2005-11-04T08:29:00.000Z	josh43	nalioth	Installed a butt-load of lib files, but no-go.. :(
