2009-03-23T16:49:00.000Z	justinnfx		know one knows where to put the mount point when installing ubuntu
2009-03-23T16:49:00.000Z	justinnfx		it give me a bunch of option
2009-03-23T16:50:00.000Z	justinnfx		Imhahilus there is usually a lot but i am now one of them
2009-03-23T16:52:00.000Z	justinnfx		Anybody know where to put my mount point at when partioning a for new installation
2009-03-23T16:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	justinnfx	 huh? clarify that a bit perhaps?   unless brous  guessed correctly
2009-03-23T16:59:00.000Z	dr_willis	justinnfx	 dident notice the question.
2009-03-23T17:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	justinnfx	 i always make primaries.. and you MUST have at least a / parittion.
2009-03-23T17:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	justinnfx	 otehrs are optional.
2009-03-23T17:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	justinnfx	 huh? / is the mountpoint name.. and where its at..  /home could be a mountpoint for a 2nd parittion
2009-03-23T17:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	justinnfx	 put / at the aprtition at the starty of the drive then.  /dev/sda1 or whatever one its called
2009-03-23T17:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	justinnfx	 you aparently dont understand mountpoints and how drives are named.
2009-03-23T17:08:00.000Z	dr_willis	justinnfx	 or use the aprtition manager tool. and delete the ones you dont want.. then tell the installer to auto parittion. and it should do it all.
2009-03-23T17:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	justinnfx	  for sda1  you select /
2009-03-23T17:11:00.000Z	dr_willis	justinnfx	 then  you use that parittions 'name' as the location for / - if you made a sda1, tell it to mount / to sda1
2009-03-23T17:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	justinnfx	 use the partition manager tool delete the partitions so you have a large section unallocated.. and let the installer do it  is one way.
2009-03-24T05:51:00.000Z	dr_willis	justinnfx	 you need to set up the proper video card drivers would be my guess..  im guessing you have an ati card?
2009-03-24T05:52:00.000Z	dr_willis	justinnfx	 check the forums for your exact video card. and the !ati bot factoid.  ati's can be a pain
2009-03-24T05:52:00.000Z	dr_willis	justinnfx	 you can install stuff via the recovery mode/command line.
2009-03-24T05:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	justinnfx	 system boot menu has options for some rescue/recovery mode.
2009-03-24T05:54:00.000Z	dr_willis	justinnfx	 hit enter perhaps? let it default..   or it shoudl time out.. unless its crashing very badly
2009-03-24T05:58:00.000Z	dr_willis	justinnfx	 i wouldent mess with wubi at all.  Check the forums for your video card to learn what needs to be done , then learn how to boot the live cd, or rescue mode to get the stuff installed/done - i cant walk ya through it. Im not on a ubuntu box at this time. and i am going to work. good luck
