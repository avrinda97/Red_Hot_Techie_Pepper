2007-10-02T09:01:00.000Z	david003		hello. where can i see what version of ubuntu i am using?
2007-10-02T09:02:00.000Z	soundray	david003	cat /etc/lsb-release
2007-10-02T09:12:00.000Z	soundray	david003	System-Preferences-Keyboard shortcuts
2007-10-04T09:57:00.000Z	soundray	david003	add this after Driver "nvidia" in /etc/X11/xorg.conf: Option "NoLogo" "true"
2007-10-04T10:04:00.000Z	soundray	david003	do you read me?
2007-10-04T10:04:00.000Z	david003	soundray	yes...
2007-10-04T10:04:00.000Z	soundray	david003	just because I responded to you earlier and you didn't comment
2007-10-04T10:04:00.000Z	david003	soundray	oh sorry, but i did a reboot and lost all
2007-10-04T10:05:00.000Z	david003	soundray	thanks by the way
2007-10-04T10:05:00.000Z	soundray	david003	did it work then?
2007-10-04T10:06:00.000Z	soundray	david003	my favorite benchmark is to throw two machines out of the window, and see which one hits the ground first.
2007-10-04T10:07:00.000Z	soundray	david003	most mainstream benchmarks provide exactly the same amount of meaningful information.
2007-10-04T10:09:00.000Z	david003	soundray	whats a mainstream benchmark? i though i meant something like 3dmark ecc
2007-10-04T10:09:00.000Z	soundray	david003	yeah, that for example
2007-10-04T10:09:00.000Z	david003	soundray	then do you know of any for ubuntu and for win toghether?
2007-10-04T10:10:00.000Z	soundray	david003	no. I've stated my opinion: "general" benchmarks are irrelevant. You have to test a machine in its intended use context to determine whether it's fast enough or not.
2007-10-04T10:11:00.000Z	david003	soundray	like getting the same zip file and getting times?
2007-10-04T10:11:00.000Z	soundray	david003	yes, if what you do for a living is zipping files.
2007-10-04T10:12:00.000Z	david003	soundray	i actually washed dishes for a while....now im without a job
2007-10-04T10:13:00.000Z	soundray	david003	then do something that will further your chances of finding a new one, instead of running benchmarks.
2007-10-04T10:13:00.000Z	david003	soundray	lol
