2008-07-07T11:02:00.000Z	BeepII		ï»¿rat409:  This is what I got:
2008-07-07T11:02:00.000Z	BeepII		chmod -x VIA_
2008-07-07T11:03:00.000Z	BeepII		ooops.
2008-07-07T11:03:00.000Z	BeepII		gonna try that again
2008-07-07T11:03:00.000Z	BeepII		it said bash: -: command not found
2008-07-07T11:04:00.000Z	Utalcn2me	BeepII	the first line in your file should have #!/bin/bash
2008-07-07T11:06:00.000Z	BeepII		rat409: yes
2008-07-07T11:07:00.000Z	BeepII		rat409:  ok, I see what I did wrong.  if I don't type -| to start a new line, the first part works.
2008-07-07T11:07:00.000Z	BeepII		but then it says ./filename.run doesn't exist.
2008-07-07T11:08:00.000Z	Utalcn2me	BeepII	try giving it the full path
2008-07-07T11:08:00.000Z	BeepII	Utalcn2me	 what does the full path start with?
2008-07-07T11:09:00.000Z	BeepII		I mean, like, home/desktop/whatever or what?
2008-07-07T11:10:00.000Z	Utalcn2me	BeepII	how about bash /home/you/filename
2008-07-07T11:14:00.000Z	BeepII	Utalcn2me	Yeah, not working.  Eeven when I cd all the way back
2008-07-07T11:15:00.000Z	Utalcn2me	BeepII	you doing a bash script, or python maybe?
2008-07-07T11:15:00.000Z	BeepII	Utalcn2me	not that I know of. . .
2008-07-07T11:16:00.000Z	BeepII		I've never used Python though the cd  looks familiar from a C++ lab I had a couple months ago
2008-07-07T11:16:00.000Z	BeepII		I don't know if that's bash though
2008-07-07T11:17:00.000Z	Utalcn2me	BeepII	i would try to run whatever is in that file from a command line to see where it's failing
2008-07-07T11:19:00.000Z	BeepII	Utalcn2me	It's failing at finding the file...
2008-07-07T11:20:00.000Z	BeepII	Utalcn2me	oooo I got it
