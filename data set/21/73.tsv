2012-10-06T09:42:00.000Z	Kheo		hello everyone I have some questions..I have a new server and I want to put back my websites and my data base how can I do that ?
2012-10-06T09:43:00.000Z	theadmin	Kheo	Most of the web stuff would reside in your htdocs directory (or /var/www for instance), as for databases use mysqldump or whatnot
2012-10-06T09:44:00.000Z	Kheo	theadmin	I've copy/paste the files on the /var/www but..do not work..
2012-10-06T09:44:00.000Z	Kheo	theadmin	how can I get them back ?!
2012-10-06T09:46:00.000Z	theadmin	Kheo	That, and dump mysql databases if any...
2012-10-06T09:47:00.000Z	Kheo	theadmin	the web sites do not work..
2012-10-06T09:47:00.000Z	Kheo	theadmin	How can I get them back to work ?
2012-10-06T09:48:00.000Z	theadmin	Kheo	That's your problem, I don't know what you're talking about, I don't know your exact setup... But are HTTPD and MySQLd started?
2012-10-06T09:48:00.000Z	Kheo	theadmin	what you do not understand ?
2012-10-06T09:49:00.000Z	theadmin	Kheo	Well different websites set things up differently, so there's that... It may be using mySQL, it may be using a flatfile database, it may be using sqlite, it might not be using a database at all...
2012-10-06T09:49:00.000Z	Kheo	theadmin	First I want to get my websites back.
2012-10-06T09:49:00.000Z	Kheo	theadmin	can you help ?
2012-10-06T09:49:00.000Z	theadmin	Kheo	I just told you that I can't. Three times in a row >.<
2012-10-06T09:50:00.000Z	Kheo	theadmin	I put them on var/www and they do not work.
2012-10-06T09:54:00.000Z	theadmin	Kheo	for i in apache2 mysql ; do sudo service $i start ; done # To start apache and mysql. But if that doesn't help then you messed something up when transferring files.
2012-10-06T09:56:00.000Z	Kheo	theadmin	I just put the old www instate of the new www.
2012-10-06T09:56:00.000Z	theadmin	Kheo	How many times did I tell you to dump mysql databases
2012-10-06T09:57:00.000Z	theadmin	Kheo	Well, mysql databases can't be just "copied over" as files, you have to use specific commands ("mysqldump" and, if I recall right, "mysqlrestore")
2012-10-06T09:59:00.000Z	theadmin	Kheo	You didn't set up PHP did you -_-
2012-10-06T10:12:00.000Z	theadmin	Kheo	You're not telling us anything about your setup and expect us to help.
2012-10-06T10:14:00.000Z	theadmin	Kheo	Stop complaining. Explain: Which webservers you have installed, which modules/plugins, which database architectures, what did you do to transfer them, whether there are major version differences or not...
