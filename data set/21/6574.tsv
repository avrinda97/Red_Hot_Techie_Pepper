2007-04-17T11:46:00.000Z	xyz-abc		Help: I installed "network manager" and cant find it's loading icon
2007-04-17T11:46:00.000Z	therealnanotube	xyz-abc	install package "network-manager-gnome", that sets up the panel icon.
2007-04-17T11:47:00.000Z	xyz-abc	therealnanotube	isn't that the same as installing it thru the synaptic?
2007-04-17T11:48:00.000Z	therealnanotube	xyz-abc	there's 'network-manager', and also 'network-manager-gnome'. two different things. at least that's how it is on dapper. :)
2007-04-17T11:48:00.000Z	therealnanotube	xyz-abc	but yea, i do mean getting it with synaptic.
2007-04-17T11:56:00.000Z	xyz-abc	therealnanotube	even after installing network-manager-gnome (thru synaptic), I still cant find how to load it
2007-04-17T11:56:00.000Z	therealnanotube	xyz-abc	run "nm-applet"
2007-04-17T11:57:00.000Z	therealnanotube	xyz-abc	and to start it automatically when you log in, just add that to your session startup.
2007-04-17T11:59:00.000Z	xyz-abc	therealnanotube	nm-applet (when run in terminal) does nothing
2007-04-17T12:01:00.000Z	therealnanotube	xyz-abc	nothing appears in the system tray? ... strange. well, maybe it doesn't work the same way as it does on dapper (that's what i'm still running). try rebooting (yea, i know...), and if it still doesn't work, i'm probably just using outdated info.
2007-04-17T12:01:00.000Z	xyz-abc	therealnanotube	you were right, it did show up, sorry
2007-04-17T12:02:00.000Z	therealnanotube	xyz-abc	oh, heh, ok. makes me feel better that i'm not completely out of date. hehe.
2007-04-17T12:02:00.000Z	xyz-abc	therealnanotube	however, this app seems to have no configuration options...
2007-04-17T12:03:00.000Z	therealnanotube	xyz-abc	click on the icon, it will give you a menu...
2007-04-17T12:04:00.000Z	xyz-abc	therealnanotube	it doesnt recognize my wireless adapter i think... i guess i'll look for another app
2007-04-17T12:06:00.000Z	therealnanotube	xyz-abc	what's the output of "ifconfig"?
2007-04-17T12:07:00.000Z	therealnanotube	xyz-abc	if ifconfig doesn't show it, then nothing will.
2007-04-17T12:08:00.000Z	xyz-abc	therealnanotube	ifconfig recognizes it, my wireless adapter does work and this is how I installed it: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Device/Belkin_F5D7050_ver_4000_(ZyDas_zd1211b_driver)
2007-04-17T12:09:00.000Z	therealnanotube	xyz-abc	if you want network-manager to manage your adapter, then you have to comment out any references to it in more /etc/network/interfaces
2007-04-17T12:12:00.000Z	xyz-abc	therealnanotube	all I want is to be able to use WPA-PSK  encryption, do I really need network-manager-gnome for that?
2007-04-17T12:13:00.000Z	therealnanotube	xyz-abc	i don't think you need it, i'm pretty sure you can run wpa without network-manager. but i don't use wpa-psk myself, so i'm out of my expertise at this point. :)
