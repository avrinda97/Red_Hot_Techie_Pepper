2010-10-03T13:50:00.000Z	beyecixramd		i meant /tmp/ lol./..
2010-10-03T13:51:00.000Z	biston	beyecixramd	what is the exact error, i mean where is the bootup process halting?
2010-10-03T13:51:00.000Z	beyecixramd	biston	GDM. I set it to auto login, it instead gives me an error and gets me back to a black background with the standard GNOME theme in GDM.
2010-10-03T13:52:00.000Z	beyecixramd	biston	by the way, i cant login in GDM with my password. It will just give me again the same error and go back to GDM
2010-10-03T13:52:00.000Z	biston	beyecixramd	then your problem is not with 'ubuntu', it's with GDM. ubuntu is booting up fine
2010-10-03T13:53:00.000Z	beyecixramd	biston	well not at all because GDM logs in actually, but GNOME shows the error and logs off
2010-10-03T13:53:00.000Z	beyecixramd	biston	okay, please hold on i will reboot and tell you
2010-10-03T14:03:00.000Z	biston	beyecixramd	trying to figure out what's wrong, give me a moment
2010-10-03T14:04:00.000Z	beyecixramd	biston	should this be OK? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1061084#8
2010-10-03T14:05:00.000Z	beyecixramd	biston	problem is there are some missing files since i removed them, but ill try then
2010-10-03T14:05:00.000Z	beyecixramd	biston	should i run that as root or as my user?
2010-10-03T14:05:00.000Z	biston	beyecixramd	no conf files are placed in /tmp, 2 - do it as ur user, using sudo
2010-10-03T14:06:00.000Z	beyecixramd	biston	in runlevel 3, right?
2010-10-03T14:06:00.000Z	biston	beyecixramd	doesnt matter what runlevel in this case
2010-10-03T14:07:00.000Z	biston	beyecixramd	and read this post as well http://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=54770&start=40#p315315
2010-10-03T14:07:00.000Z	beyecixramd	biston	reading
2010-10-03T14:07:00.000Z	biston	beyecixramd	this is Linux Mint, but also Debian, it caused same problem when /home had wrong perms. so check that too
2010-10-03T14:07:00.000Z	beyecixramd	biston	yeah i know, thanks :)
2010-10-03T14:08:00.000Z	beyecixramd	biston	im supposed to put my user (beyecixramd in this case ) where user is in *sudo chown user:user /home *, right?
2010-10-03T14:08:00.000Z	beyecixramd	biston	so it's beyecixramd:beyecixramd
2010-10-03T14:10:00.000Z	biston	beyecixramd	if the perms on /tmp don't fix the problem, try the /home should be owned by root:root, the directories inside are what concerns you
