2011-11-11T13:58:00.000Z	Lasers	oddy_	You need LiveCD. Listen to qbitza. :)
2011-11-11T13:59:00.000Z	oddy_	Lasers	the last time I used this computer I unplugged the power cable instead of turning off
2011-11-11T14:08:00.000Z	oddy_	Lasers	qbitza, BlauskaerM : the liveCD is running now, what to do next??
2011-11-11T14:16:00.000Z	Lasers	oddy_	You can if you're fully resolved in hanging out in this channel until you fixed it.
2011-11-11T14:17:00.000Z	Lasers	oddy_	It's easier to backup everything (/home/ and /etc) and reinstall.
2011-11-11T14:18:00.000Z	oddy_	Lasers	I don't have no internet connection on this computer, so I'll lose all the Apps
2011-11-11T14:18:00.000Z	oddy_	Lasers	I have no *
2011-11-11T14:19:00.000Z	Lasers	oddy_	I see.
2011-11-11T14:19:00.000Z	Lasers	oddy_	Why not?
2011-11-11T14:20:00.000Z	oddy_	Lasers	do you mean, I can save everything even the my programs?
2011-11-11T14:20:00.000Z	Lasers	oddy_	You can rescue personal file, documents, etc. But as for programs, you can reinstall them from Internet.
2011-11-11T14:20:00.000Z	oddy_	Lasers	don't reinstall would remove all the installed software??
2011-11-11T14:21:00.000Z	oddy_	Lasers	aha
2011-11-11T14:21:00.000Z	oddy_	Lasers	don't you have any idea how can i fix it, or even find the way to fix it?
2011-11-11T14:23:00.000Z	Lasers	oddy_	It require an Internet conncetion (or 10.04.3 LTS Disc). You can recover your personal/important files. Move them to different/secondary hard drive. Install a fresh copy of Ubuntu on the first hard drive.
2011-11-11T14:25:00.000Z	oddy_	Lasers	no< i mean fix the problem without reinstallation
2011-11-11T14:25:00.000Z	Lasers	oddy_	It is possible. Yes. I just don't want to get into it because it would enable me to search forums and archives for hours.
2011-11-11T14:26:00.000Z	oddy_	Lasers	then tell me what to search about, and I'll do it
2011-11-11T14:27:00.000Z	Lasers	oddy_	ubuntu busybox recovery, for starters.
2011-11-11T14:28:00.000Z	oddy_	Lasers	ok, thank you
