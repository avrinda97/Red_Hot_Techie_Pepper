2012-04-29T21:03:00.000Z	wolter		halp! my internet is disconnecting every other second after I updated to 12.04
2012-04-29T21:04:00.000Z	wolter		and reconnecting about instantly
2012-04-29T21:04:00.000Z	gmachine_24	wolter	wirelessly, I presume?
2012-04-29T21:04:00.000Z	wolter	gmachine_24	yes
2012-04-29T21:05:00.000Z	gmachine_24	wolter	you installed the software for the wireless chipset?
2012-04-29T21:06:00.000Z	wolter	gmachine_24	I upgraded from 11.10 where I had everything configured and running fine, should I still install this software?
2012-04-29T21:08:00.000Z	gmachine_24	wolter	if there is specialized software for the wireless chipset, then yes. and did you reboot after the upgrade? I'm guessing you had to.
2012-04-29T21:09:00.000Z	wolter	gmachine_24	do you have a clue as to how can I identify this software to install it?
2012-04-29T21:10:00.000Z	gmachine_24	wolter	yes. you use the pull down menus from the top
2012-04-29T21:11:00.000Z	gmachine_24	wolter	administration, then additional drivers
2012-04-29T21:13:00.000Z	gmachine_24	wolter	I don't know how others feel about this, but sometimes when I'm have wireless connectivity problems I install WICD and that seems to resolve the issue(s)
2012-04-29T21:14:00.000Z	gmachine_24	wolter	that doesn't 'seem' to resolve the issue(s), it does resolve it/them
2012-04-29T21:16:00.000Z	wolter	gmachine_24	tried it once, and didn't work much :/ perhaps I should roll back the driver until the waters clear up
2012-04-29T21:17:00.000Z	gmachine_24	wolter	did you find additional drivers available for your wireless chipset?
2012-04-29T21:17:00.000Z	wolter	gmachine_24	everything is to its latest version, I just peaked
2012-04-29T21:17:00.000Z	gmachine_24	wolter	peeked, but ok
2012-04-29T21:18:00.000Z	wolter	gmachine_24	thats right heh
2012-04-29T21:18:00.000Z	gmachine_24	wolter	I don't know about rolling back the drivers. Perhaps someone else can help you with that.
2012-04-29T21:22:00.000Z	wolter	gmachine_24	ok thanks for your time
2012-04-29T21:22:00.000Z	gmachine_24	wolter	yw but I don't think I helped
2012-04-29T21:23:00.000Z	wolter	gmachine_24	thats why I thank you for your time and not for a solution haha
