2006-04-11T16:20:00.000Z	ramvi		Heya. I changed to Ati Radeon driver (instead of fglrx), but I changed back. I rebooted, but there was a new kernel (*.20 instead of .19) and now the only ting that works is 640x480 =(
2006-04-11T16:21:00.000Z	ramvi		when I set the res to 1024 it's all "scrabbily"
2006-04-11T16:21:00.000Z	ramvi		What do I do?
2006-04-11T16:22:00.000Z	ramvi		Please :(
2006-04-11T16:23:00.000Z	Kamping_Kaiser	ramvi	check what driver its currently using
2006-04-11T16:24:00.000Z	ramvi	Kamping_Kaiser	should I run a command?
2006-04-11T16:24:00.000Z	Kamping_Kaiser	ramvi	open  up konsole and type "grep Driver /etc/X11/xorg.conf"
2006-04-11T16:26:00.000Z	ramvi	Kamping_Kaiser	  Driver "kbd" /n  Driver "mouse" /n  Driver "synaptics"
2006-04-11T16:27:00.000Z	Kamping_Kaiser	ramvi	its a laptop?
2006-04-11T16:28:00.000Z	Kamping_Kaiser	ramvi	it looks like yoru driver line isnt even there anymore
2006-04-11T16:28:00.000Z	ramvi	Kamping_Kaiser	I guess I've screwed it even more up :p
2006-04-11T16:29:00.000Z	Kamping_Kaiser	ramvi	run `sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2006-04-11T16:29:00.000Z	Kamping_Kaiser	ramvi	and follow the prompts. select "ati" not fglxrx unless you know the ati driver is installed
2006-04-11T16:33:00.000Z	ramvi	Kamping_Kaiser	All done. Now I do a reboot?
2006-04-11T16:33:00.000Z	Kamping_Kaiser	ramvi	just `sudo /etc/init.d/kdm restart` should do
2006-04-11T16:34:00.000Z	Kamping_Kaiser	ramvi	then kdm
2006-04-11T16:40:00.000Z	ramvi	Kamping_Kaiser	Thanks! Are you Norwegian?
2006-04-11T16:40:00.000Z	Kamping_Kaiser	ramvi	no, i'm not
2006-04-11T16:42:00.000Z	ramvi	Kamping_Kaiser	thanks anyway ;) Quick question: I see there's some options for multiple monitors in the control panel, but they're greyed out... Is there an easy way to use two monitors in linux? I think it looks a bit hard editing the xconf file...
2006-04-11T16:43:00.000Z	Kamping_Kaiser	ramvi	there is, but its easyest with an Nvidia card(what i have), so i dont know about ati
2006-04-11T16:44:00.000Z	Kamping_Kaiser	ramvi	i would check teh forums if i was you
