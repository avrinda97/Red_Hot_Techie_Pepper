2009-10-30T22:21:00.000Z	DopeGhoti	derek_smart	karmic *is* koala
2009-10-30T22:21:00.000Z	derek_smart	DopeGhoti	thats a common misconception i was told in bsd mailing list that koala is the testing version
2009-10-30T22:24:00.000Z	DopeGhoti	derek_smart	again, Karmic and Koala are _exactly_ the same release.
2009-10-30T22:24:00.000Z	DopeGhoti	derek_smart	9.10 is "Karmic Koala"
2009-10-30T22:28:00.000Z	DopeGhoti	derek_smart	Karmic Koala is *one* version.  Karmic ≡ Koala.
2009-10-30T22:32:00.000Z	DopeGhoti	derek_smart	Yes.  Karmic Koala is the successor to Jaunty Jackalope.
2009-10-30T22:33:00.000Z	DopeGhoti	derek_smart	without knowing who 'he' is what what precisely yo uwere told, it's hard to say.
2009-10-30T22:35:00.000Z	DopeGhoti	derek_smart	"Karmic Koala" is the *codename* for Ubuntu 9.10. Is that what you mean?
2009-10-30T22:57:00.000Z	DopeGhoti	derek_smart	I have a system with 2GB of RAM and 512MB of swap. And it can hibernate. So you are demonstrably wrong here.
2009-10-30T22:57:00.000Z	derek_smart	DopeGhoti	/etc/sysctl has values for image compression...
2009-10-30T22:57:00.000Z	derek_smart	DopeGhoti	they can be compressed under ram, but its not guaranteed
2009-10-30T22:58:00.000Z	derek_smart	DopeGhoti	were you using all of your ram at the time you hibernated?
2009-10-30T22:58:00.000Z	derek_smart	DopeGhoti	most likely not
2009-10-30T22:58:00.000Z	DopeGhoti	derek_smart	the point being that "swap size must be ≥ RAM size" is incorrect :)
2009-10-30T22:58:00.000Z	derek_smart	DopeGhoti	i was making that suggestion as a safe starting point, your usage pattern wasnt exploiting the safe net to its fullest
2009-10-30T22:58:00.000Z	derek_smart	DopeGhoti	if you had been using your total ram
2009-10-30T22:59:00.000Z	derek_smart	DopeGhoti	hibernation wouldnt have been a possibility
2009-10-30T22:59:00.000Z	derek_smart	DopeGhoti	this is well documented in the kernel source code comments
2009-10-30T22:59:00.000Z	derek_smart	DopeGhoti	how about you give them a thorough read and comprehension session
2009-10-30T23:00:00.000Z	derek_smart	DopeGhoti	that is irrelevant. your ram usage pattern shouldnt be altered because of hibernation
2009-10-30T23:00:00.000Z	derek_smart	DopeGhoti	and making suggestions on that principle alone is ignorant
