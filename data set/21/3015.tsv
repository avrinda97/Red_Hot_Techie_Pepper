2009-06-04T07:54:00.000Z	kohlrak		either a screenshot or terminal output on pastebin might help
2009-06-04T07:54:00.000Z	kohlrak		preferably terminal output since it's more informative
2009-06-04T07:55:00.000Z	kohlrak		and for some unknown reason, it doesn't do it automatically like everything else
2009-06-04T07:55:00.000Z	RedSocrates	kohlrak	compiz is not installed by default?  It was for me.
2009-06-04T07:56:00.000Z	kohlrak	RedSocrates	Since when? I've often had the same error message he's claiming to have and going in and installing compiz related packages (including compiz itself) removed it.
2009-06-04T07:57:00.000Z	RedSocrates	kohlrak	I don't know.  Just re-installed 9.04 on a computer today, and compiz shows up among the processes
2009-06-04T08:08:00.000Z	RedSocrates	kohlrak	It was disabled by the X developers, apparently there was a vote and they decided it was good to disable it
2009-06-04T08:08:00.000Z	kohlrak	RedSocrates	Lemme guess, same with the print screen button now having to do with music or something instead of screenshots as well? XD
2009-06-04T08:08:00.000Z	RedSocrates	kohlrak	Not sure about that :)
2009-06-04T08:09:00.000Z	RedSocrates	kohlrak	Section "ServerFlags" | Option "DontZap" "Off" | EndSection
2009-06-04T08:09:00.000Z	RedSocrates	kohlrak	Where each '|' indicates a new line
2009-06-04T08:09:00.000Z	kohlrak	RedSocrates	i recently discovered that change and it was really annoying really quickly because i had to find another way to take a screnshot, whcih i eventually did, but still annoying.
2009-06-04T08:11:00.000Z	kohlrak	RedSocrates	any other key changes i should know about?
2009-06-04T08:12:00.000Z	RedSocrates	kohlrak	Not that I know of
2009-06-04T08:12:00.000Z	kohlrak	RedSocrates	I sure hope there isn't. XD Last thing i need is weird windows poping up when i press numlock or something.
2009-06-04T08:13:00.000Z	RedSocrates	kohlrak	Haha, I know the feeling.  I had a heck of a time with my laptop trying to use SysRq.  I had to type and release a couple keys in a certain order to get it to work
2009-06-04T08:14:00.000Z	kohlrak	RedSocrates	Of the complaints of linux, the only lagitimate ones i heard mostly surrounded keybindings and such.
2009-06-04T08:14:00.000Z	kohlrak	RedSocrates	There were other lagitimate ones of course, just most people have key trouble
2009-06-04T08:14:00.000Z	RedSocrates	kohlrak	Yeah, when the keys don't work as you expect, things can get pretty difficult
2009-06-04T08:16:00.000Z	RedSocrates	kohlrak	Haha, nice.  At least a good learning experience :P
2009-06-04T08:17:00.000Z	kohlrak	RedSocrates	Next thing you know, they'll add a purge shortcut to gedit and it'll delete the text and the file
