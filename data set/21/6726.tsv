2007-02-08T15:06:00.000Z	mfox		I have a question.. I recently installed Ubuntu but now when I try to ./configure my eggdrop, I get error: C compiler cannot create executables
2007-02-08T15:06:00.000Z	mfox		Anyone have a clue?
2007-02-08T15:07:00.000Z	mwe	mfox	^^
2007-02-08T15:09:00.000Z	mwe	mfox	yw
2007-02-08T15:10:00.000Z	mwe	mfox	yeah
2007-02-08T15:11:00.000Z	mwe	mfox	but if you type tcl in a terminal it's found?
2007-02-08T15:11:00.000Z	mwe	mfox	dpkg -l|grep tcl
2007-02-08T15:12:00.000Z	mfox	mwe	ii  tcl8.4                                     8.4.12-1.1                           Tcl (the Tool Command Language) v8.4 - run-t
2007-02-08T15:13:00.000Z	mwe	mfox	hmm
2007-02-08T15:13:00.000Z	mfox	mwe	 Should I just try to remove it w/apt and install from source?
2007-02-08T15:13:00.000Z	mwe	mfox	tcl <tab> <tab> ?
2007-02-08T15:14:00.000Z	mfox	mwe	Hmm?
2007-02-08T15:14:00.000Z	mwe	mfox	I think it's tclsh though, not tcl.
2007-02-08T15:14:00.000Z	mfox	mwe	 Yeah..it saw tclsh and tclsh8.4
2007-02-08T15:15:00.000Z	mwe	mfox	your source code sounds broken then
2007-02-08T15:15:00.000Z	mfox	mwe	 Its cool, ill try it from src :)
2007-02-08T15:15:00.000Z	mwe	mfox	or install tcl8.4-dev maybe
2007-02-08T15:15:00.000Z	mwe	mfox	perhaps the program needs the headers
2007-02-08T15:15:00.000Z	mfox	mwe	 You know which headers?
2007-02-08T15:16:00.000Z	mwe	mfox	tcl8.4-dev
2007-02-08T15:17:00.000Z	mfox	mwe	 Thanks again for the help.. I just downloaded it from source and made it that way.. maybe its the package with apt
