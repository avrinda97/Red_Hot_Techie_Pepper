2012-11-09T13:02:00.000Z	nicekiwi		anyone know anything about accessing your encrypted home directory as root from command prompt?
2012-11-09T13:03:00.000Z	bpuzzled	nicekiwi	if you don't have the passphrase, you won't get access -- even as root.
2012-11-09T13:03:00.000Z	nicekiwi	bpuzzled	i DO have the passphrase. thats the %$%&$^*ing annoying thing.
2012-11-09T13:05:00.000Z	bpuzzled	nicekiwi	this might be promising: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EncryptedPrivateDirectory
2012-11-09T13:06:00.000Z	nicekiwi	bpuzzled	yeah ive been there.. was 100% unhelpful. :(
2012-11-09T13:06:00.000Z	nicekiwi	bpuzzled	btw.. what is the passphrase? is it the text I typed in when I setup the passphrase or is it the hash that was returned?
2012-11-09T13:07:00.000Z	bpuzzled	nicekiwi	the text you entered.
2012-11-09T13:07:00.000Z	nicekiwi	bpuzzled	ah.. i was afraid of that..
2012-11-09T13:07:00.000Z	nicekiwi	bpuzzled	im 100% screwed now.. I was hoping it was the hash so maybe i just made a typo.. but i know the text i typed in and it dosnt work :(
2012-11-09T13:08:00.000Z	nicekiwi	bpuzzled	good thing it was only a fresh install. :P Hello Installation round 2! :D
2012-11-09T13:08:00.000Z	bpuzzled	nicekiwi	did you include any characters that might be different if the installer used a US keyboard mapping?  e.g. " might actually be @.
2012-11-09T13:09:00.000Z	nicekiwi	bpuzzled	I dont belive so. only a #
2012-11-09T13:11:00.000Z	nicekiwi	bpuzzled	ecryptfs-mount-private keeps giving me errors.
2012-11-09T13:11:00.000Z	bpuzzled	nicekiwi	ah. :/  typing # on a uk keyboard gives Â£, but if you're using US through and through, I guess that wouldn't have happened.
2012-11-09T13:11:00.000Z	nicekiwi	bpuzzled	yeah ive hit that lil snag before. Not this time
2012-11-09T13:13:00.000Z	bpuzzled	nicekiwi	what errors does ecryptfs-mount-private give you?
2012-11-09T13:15:00.000Z	nicekiwi	bpuzzled	open: no such file or directory, Error locking counter
2012-11-09T13:16:00.000Z	bpuzzled	nicekiwi	tbh, I've never used ecryptfs, but it sounds like ~/.ecryptfsrc is missing.
2012-11-09T13:17:00.000Z	bpuzzled	nicekiwi	you could find out for sure by doing: strace ecryptfs-mount-private | grep open
2012-11-09T13:20:00.000Z	nicekiwi	bpuzzled	eeks.. no idea what all that is. Im jsut gonna reinstall without encryption. this isnt worth understanding
2012-11-09T13:20:00.000Z	bpuzzled	nicekiwi	fair enough. :)
