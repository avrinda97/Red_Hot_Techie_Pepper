2008-08-06T22:14:00.000Z	galexcd		glitz uses automake, in order to generate the Makefiles for glitz use:
2008-08-06T22:14:00.000Z	galexcd		 $ autogen.sh
2008-08-06T22:14:00.000Z	galexcd		What do I do to install it?
2008-08-06T22:16:00.000Z	TiredWolf	galexcd	uhm, libglitz is packaged, why are you compiling it?
2008-08-06T22:18:00.000Z	TiredWolf	galexcd	(although you might want libglitz-glx1 instead of libglitz1, i'm not sure, perhaps try both)
2008-08-06T22:24:00.000Z	TiredWolf	galexcd	no, i'm absolutely not saying that
2008-08-06T22:24:00.000Z	TiredWolf	galexcd	err yes sorry, i misread, yes, i'm absolutely saying that.
2008-08-06T22:24:00.000Z	TiredWolf	galexcd	(or you can use Synaptic)
2008-08-06T22:25:00.000Z	TiredWolf	galexcd	although the package name is either "libglitz1" or "libglitz-glx1", not "libglitz-glx"
2008-08-06T22:26:00.000Z	galexcd	TiredWolf	 alright, well it says that both libglitz1 and libglitz-glx1 are already the newest versions
2008-08-06T22:27:00.000Z	TiredWolf	galexcd	yet cairo-dock doesn't compile? what's the errors, can you pastebin them? (by the way, while cairo-dock is not in the official repositories, i suspect there is an ubuntu .deb somewhere)
2008-08-06T22:28:00.000Z	TiredWolf	galexcd	uhm, what's the error precisely, and where did you get the .deb from?
2008-08-06T22:31:00.000Z	galexcd	TiredWolf	I got it from here http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=8724
2008-08-06T22:36:00.000Z	TiredWolf	galexcd	that .deb is most likely for Debian, not Ubuntu. try using the one at http://repository.cairo-dock.org/ubuntu/dists/hardy/cairo-dock/binary-i386/, as instructed by https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CairoDock
2008-08-06T22:41:00.000Z	galexcd	TiredWolf	 it installed without errors but it's still giving me the same error when I try to run it
2008-08-06T22:41:00.000Z	TiredWolf	galexcd	well will you give me the error please
2008-08-06T22:43:00.000Z	TiredWolf	galexcd	that file belongs to libglitz-glx1. it really should be there if you installed it. what's the output of "apt-cache policy libglitz-glx1 | grep stalled"?
2008-08-06T22:44:00.000Z	TiredWolf	galexcd	so weird. how are you starting cairo-dock? from the console?
2008-08-06T22:46:00.000Z	TiredWolf	galexcd	the output of "ls -l /usr/lib/libglitz-glx.so.1" ?
2008-08-06T22:47:00.000Z	TiredWolf	galexcd	no filename is in red there, right?
2008-08-06T22:47:00.000Z	TiredWolf	galexcd	uhm, try typing "sudo ldconfig" and then starting cairo-dock again. otherwise i'm at a loss.
