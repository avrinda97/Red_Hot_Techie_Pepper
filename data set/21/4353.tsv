2008-07-30T00:59:00.000Z	HangukMiguk_		My external hard drive has magically changed from writeable to read-only without me changing fstab. Help!

2008-07-30T01:02:00.000Z	geirha	HangukMiguk_	ntfs?
2008-07-30T01:02:00.000Z	HangukMiguk_	geirha	vfat
2008-07-30T01:02:00.000Z	geirha	HangukMiguk_	were any other users logged on when it was connected?
2008-07-30T01:03:00.000Z	HangukMiguk_		i'm the sole user
2008-07-30T01:03:00.000Z	geirha	HangukMiguk_	what does "ls -ld /media/mountpoint" say? (with the proper mountpoint of course)
2008-07-30T01:05:00.000Z	HangukMiguk_		all it does is tell me there's differences between boot sector and it's backup.
2008-07-30T01:05:00.000Z	geirha	HangukMiguk_	I think anirudh0's suggestion is a good idea btw. unmount and run fsck.vfat or dosfsck on the partition. This may be caused by filesystem error
2008-07-30T01:05:00.000Z	HangukMiguk_		then:  File system has 2441533 clusters but only space for 2441470 FAT entries
2008-07-30T01:06:00.000Z	geirha	HangukMiguk_	oh, that kindof make it sound like there's too many files on it ...
2008-07-30T01:06:00.000Z	HangukMiguk_		shouldn't be
2008-07-30T01:07:00.000Z	HangukMiguk_		how in the world can there be "too many files on a hard drive?"
2008-07-30T01:08:00.000Z	HangukMiguk_		ok, once again, how can there be too many files on a hard drive?
2008-07-30T01:09:00.000Z	HangukMiguk_		ok, for the third time, how can there be "too many files" on a hard drive?
2008-07-30T01:10:00.000Z	geirha	HangukMiguk_	there's a limit to how many files a filesystem can addresss
2008-07-30T01:11:00.000Z	HangukMiguk_	geirha	?
2008-07-30T01:11:00.000Z	HangukMiguk_	geirha	and why would that lock me out of MOVING something off a hard drive?
2008-07-30T01:12:00.000Z	HangukMiguk_	geirha	and why doesn't this lock me out of the hard drive on a windows box?
2008-07-30T01:12:00.000Z	geirha	HangukMiguk_	I don't know if that is the case. I don't have that much knowledge about fat filesystems, I'm making guesses
2008-07-30T01:18:00.000Z	geirha	HangukMiguk_	according to google, there's a maximum number of files in each directory, I can't find anything of a total ... but anyway, having windows to a scandisk or chkdisk on the drive might fix things
