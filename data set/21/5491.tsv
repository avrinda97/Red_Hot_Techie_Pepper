2007-12-27T07:44:00.000Z	alexvd		might be dual monitors
2007-12-27T07:45:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	alexvd	what isn't working for you?
2007-12-27T07:46:00.000Z	alexvd	IndyGunFreak	When I unselect expand my autohide doesnt work on gnome panel.  Running 7.10 witout compiz
2007-12-27T07:47:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	alexvd	hmm, i'm running dual screens, and it seems to be working fine for me(unchecked expand, and autohide is working)
2007-12-27T07:47:00.000Z	alexvd	IndyGunFreak	are you running a stretched screen
2007-12-27T07:48:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		yes..
2007-12-27T07:48:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		i have two panels, 1 on each monitor, across the top, but i just auto hid the one on th left, and it worked fine.
2007-12-27T07:48:00.000Z	alexvd	IndyGunFreak	I dont know why i am having this issue.  Annoying
2007-12-27T07:49:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	alexvd	don't know.. i hate auto-hide, so i probably wouldnt have noticed it if i had the problem
2007-12-27T07:52:00.000Z	alexvd	IndyGunFreak	So I noticed that when I unselect expand my desktop items shift over to the right into the other screen.  Wierd
2007-12-27T07:53:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	alexvd	i have no logical explanation for that, it works fine for me..
2007-12-27T07:55:00.000Z	alexvd	IndyGunFreak	I have another question that could be related.  At one point I was trying to mess with Xorg settings and I put an option in that specified a memory size.  It caused a really wierd situation that when i enabled compiz it then gave me a black bar across the right half of my screen. I cannot figure out how to get rid of that.  I would assume to rerun xorg setup but I am not sure.  I did edit that out of Xorg but it n
2007-12-27T07:55:00.000Z	alexvd		ever got rid of it.
2007-12-27T07:56:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	alexvd	not really sure, i've honestly never had a prob w/ Dual screens.., so i couldn't really tell you, reconfiguring would probably work.  here's a pic of my desktop w/ the taskbars autohid.. youc an barely see them at the top on each "side"..
2007-12-27T07:57:00.000Z	alexvd	IndyGunFreak	something funky with any new panel I add.  I can autohide the top and uncheck expand with no issues.
2007-12-27T07:57:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		hmm, wierd... http://i82.photobucket.com/albums/j263/IndyGunFreak/autohide.jpg
2007-12-27T07:58:00.000Z	alexvd	IndyGunFreak	 what is the command for reconfiguring xorg sudo dpgkg reconfigure????
2007-12-27T07:58:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	alexvd	pretty sure...
2007-12-27T07:58:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	alexvd	hang on i'll look for sure
2007-12-27T07:59:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	alexvd	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
