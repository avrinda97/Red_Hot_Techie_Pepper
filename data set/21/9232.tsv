2006-03-28T08:54:00.000Z	thechitowncubs		How hard is it to create an ftp server with different users that direct to their respective directory?
2006-03-28T08:55:00.000Z	FliesLikeABrick	thechitowncubs	almost every ftp server does that by default
2006-03-28T08:55:00.000Z	FliesLikeABrick	thechitowncubs	apt-get install vsftpd then nano /etc/vsftpd.conf to change the configuration to your taste.  done.
2006-03-28T08:55:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	FliesLikeABrick	i'll see how it works
2006-03-28T08:59:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	FliesLikeABrick	what do I need to change to tell it what directory to go to for each user?
2006-03-28T08:59:00.000Z	FliesLikeABrick	thechitowncubs	 do you want it to go to the user's home directory?
2006-03-28T08:59:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	FliesLikeABrick	yes
2006-03-28T08:59:00.000Z	FliesLikeABrick	thechitowncubs	 it does that by default
2006-03-28T09:00:00.000Z	FliesLikeABrick	thechitowncubs	 you have to do sudo /etc/init.d/vsftpd restart after making changes to the configuration
2006-03-28T09:00:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	FliesLikeABrick	ya i did that too
2006-03-28T09:00:00.000Z	FliesLikeABrick	thechitowncubs	 try doing stop instead of restart, then do start
2006-03-28T09:01:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	FliesLikeABrick	ya
2006-03-28T09:02:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	FliesLikeABrick	what else should I try
2006-03-28T09:02:00.000Z	FliesLikeABrick	thechitowncubs	do /etc/init.d/vsftpd stop, then do ps aux | grep vsftpd and tell me if any processes show up for vsftpd still
2006-03-28T09:02:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	FliesLikeABrick	alright
2006-03-28T09:02:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	FliesLikeABrick	thanks for the help btw
2006-03-28T09:04:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	FliesLikeABrick	alright
2006-03-28T09:04:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	FliesLikeABrick	start it up?
2006-03-28T09:05:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	FliesLikeABrick	nothing... meh
2006-03-28T09:08:00.000Z	thechitowncubs	FliesLikeABrick	my login isn't even accepted, my password either
2006-03-28T09:09:00.000Z	FliesLikeABrick	thechitowncubs	I'm not sure what to say, you either didn't entirely restart vsftpd or you messed something up in the configuration
