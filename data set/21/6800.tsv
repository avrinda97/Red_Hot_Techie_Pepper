2007-03-06T11:10:00.000Z	ramza3	kelsin	 what is that
2007-03-06T11:10:00.000Z	kelsin	ramza3	add a "umask=222" option
2007-03-06T11:11:00.000Z	kelsin	ramza3	it makes the default permission on all files r-xr-xr-x
2007-03-06T11:11:00.000Z	kelsin	ramza3	so after (or before) the credentials you need ",umask=222,blah..."
2007-03-06T11:11:00.000Z	ramza3	kelsin	 does the order of my options in my fstab matter?
2007-03-06T11:12:00.000Z	kelsin	ramza3	I don't want to say "no" and be wrong, but I've never had them matter for the things I mount (including samba)
2007-03-06T11:44:00.000Z	ramza3	kelsin	back again:  now I have this and still doesnt give me the permissions I want, only root can do anything "auto,rw,users,credentials=/etc/samba/indiasamba.cred,umask=222"
2007-03-06T11:44:00.000Z	kelsin	ramza3	are the permissions for the mount point still rwx------?
2007-03-06T11:52:00.000Z	ramza3	kelsin	you got any more info for me
2007-03-06T11:53:00.000Z	kelsin	ramza3	sorry didn't see a response to me asking if the permissions were still rwx------
2007-03-06T11:53:00.000Z	ramza3	kelsin	 yes and with user=1003 and group=1003
2007-03-06T11:55:00.000Z	kelsin	ramza3	honestly that stumps me since umask should solve it, try umask=2222 or umask=0002 also, I could be wrong about only needing 222
2007-03-06T11:55:00.000Z	ramza3	kelsin	 nope, no dice
2007-03-06T11:56:00.000Z	kelsin	ramza3	then I would try removing the rw, the users, or the auto parts of it one by one as well to see if one of them is overwriting the umask
2007-03-06T11:58:00.000Z	ramza3	kelsin	is mount -a supposed to pick up what is my fstab
2007-03-06T11:58:00.000Z	kelsin	ramza3	yes
2007-03-06T12:01:00.000Z	ramza3	kelsin	I have tabs in my fstab file, does that matter
2007-03-10T10:42:00.000Z	kelsin	ramza3	it can be based on xine ir gstreamer, totem-xine or totem-gstreamer (I think) are the packages
2007-12-01T12:37:00.000Z	kelsin	ramza3	just as a note, you're not going to get good quality going from ogg -> mp3
2007-12-01T12:39:00.000Z	ramza3	kelsin	i have an input program that only supports mp3
2007-12-01T12:40:00.000Z	kelsin	ramza3	I'm not saying you shouldn't be trying to get mp3's as an end result, but if you can encode the mp3s from flacs, or original data that's the better option
