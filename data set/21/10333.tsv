2005-04-04T12:56:00.000Z	IRCNinjaMonkey		Hello I was wondering if someone can help me out?

2005-04-04T12:59:00.000Z	nis	IRCNinjaMonkey	that's odd.
2005-04-04T12:59:00.000Z	nis	IRCNinjaMonkey	boot the install media and dd the first meg with zeros to wipe it clean.
2005-04-04T13:00:00.000Z	nis	IRCNinjaMonkey	I told you how to restore the disk to factory nothingness.  Would destroy entire drive contents but would allow Linux a fair crack at it.
2005-04-04T13:01:00.000Z	nis	IRCNinjaMonkey	dd will (should) be available from a linux boot diskette or LiveCD image.
2005-04-04T13:01:00.000Z	nis	IRCNinjaMonkey	it is like rawrite.exe
2005-04-04T13:02:00.000Z	nis	IRCNinjaMonkey	writes directly to disk sectors.
2005-04-04T13:04:00.000Z	nis	IRCNinjaMonkey	what model/make drive? technology ATA/IDE?
2005-04-04T13:05:00.000Z	nis	IRCNinjaMonkey	about what year was the drive made?
2005-04-04T13:06:00.000Z	nis	IRCNinjaMonkey	should be seen accurately then.
2005-04-04T13:06:00.000Z	nis	IRCNinjaMonkey	did linux kernel boot at all?
2005-04-04T13:08:00.000Z	nis	IRCNinjaMonkey	might be profitable to record what fdisk says, to disk.
2005-04-04T13:08:00.000Z	nis	IRCNinjaMonkey	sounds like a kernel snafu.
2005-04-04T13:09:00.000Z	nis	IRCNinjaMonkey	absolutely.
2005-04-04T13:09:00.000Z	nis	IRCNinjaMonkey	put debian woody on it.
2005-04-04T13:10:00.000Z	nis	IRCNinjaMonkey	then u'll be in sweet position for ubuntu upgrade from woody.
2005-04-04T13:10:00.000Z	nis	IRCNinjaMonkey	whatever works and sees all 40 gigs.
2005-04-04T13:11:00.000Z	nis	IRCNinjaMonkey	if it was like Win 95 I'd suggest loadlin.exe
2005-04-04T13:11:00.000Z	nis	IRCNinjaMonkey	debian.crosslink.net has a good archive of older debian install media.
2005-04-04T13:12:00.000Z	nis	IRCNinjaMonkey	welcome.
