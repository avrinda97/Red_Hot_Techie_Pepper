2010-10-16T08:16:00.000Z	Saik	kz6090	what site was it for you that screwed up? you an pm it if you want
2010-10-16T08:17:00.000Z	Saik	kz6090	.net is an ad site for me
2010-10-16T08:18:00.000Z	kz6090	Saik	sry, it's .com
2010-10-16T08:18:00.000Z	Saik	kz6090	.com is an actual site, and is formatted etc fine
2010-10-16T08:19:00.000Z	kz6090	Saik	it looks fine in opera for me, but not in ff. I tried cleaning the cache, removing cookies, idk what else to do.
2010-10-16T08:19:00.000Z	Saik	kz6090	I'm using FF right now, it's loaded fine
2010-10-16T08:20:00.000Z	kz6090	Saik	sadly not here. i'm checking LQ atm. Someone is sure to have solved this issue already.
2010-10-16T08:21:00.000Z	Saik	kz6090	hm?
2010-10-16T08:22:00.000Z	Saik	kz6090	have you tried reinsalling ff?
2010-10-16T08:23:00.000Z	Saik	kz6090	lemme know if that solves it for you, cause if it does I'm gonna probably have to do that here too
2010-10-16T08:24:00.000Z	kz6090	Saik	will do.
2010-10-16T08:24:00.000Z	Saik	kz6090	thanks
