2005-04-16T10:34:00.000Z	i3dmaster		I got a weird problem but could not find out why... I loaded ubuntu hoary to a IBM NetVista desktop, everything runs fine if I don't lock my screen using xscreenserver. But everyday when I lock my screen and back home, on the other day I come, the box is lways hung, cannot do anything without reboot.
2005-04-16T10:34:00.000Z	i3dmaster		Where should I look at to identify the problem?
2005-04-16T10:34:00.000Z	Dreamer3	i3dmaster	sounds like video issue
2005-04-16T10:34:00.000Z	Dreamer3	i3dmaster	perhaps
2005-04-16T10:35:00.000Z	i3dmaster	Dreamer3	how to confirm that then?
2005-04-16T10:35:00.000Z	Dreamer3	i3dmaster	or faulty memory/processor, etc... but if you're sure the system is solid the problem is likely somewhere with video/3d
2005-04-16T10:35:00.000Z	Dreamer3	i3dmaster	turn off xscreen saver and see if it keeps running
2005-04-16T10:37:00.000Z	i3dmaster	Dreamer3	Ya, I don't see any problem when I am using it. But just after I lock the screen. And it did not happen if I unlock it in a short time cause I tested it before. Seems like it only happens when the lock screen status has already been a while, like overnight
2005-04-16T10:38:00.000Z	Dreamer3	i3dmaster	right
2005-04-16T10:38:00.000Z	i3dmaster	Dreamer3	while the thing is I cannot leave it without lock it
2005-04-16T10:38:00.000Z	Dreamer3	i3dmaster	what hardware?
2005-04-16T10:38:00.000Z	Dreamer3	i3dmaster	set "blank screen only" and give it a few days
2005-04-16T10:38:00.000Z	Dreamer3	i3dmaster	if that works the problem is surely your video/3d
2005-04-16T10:39:00.000Z	Dreamer3	i3dmaster	what hardware?
2005-04-16T10:39:00.000Z	i3dmaster		P4 2.8, 512DDR, 40G, VGA compatible controller: Intel Corp. 82845G/GL[Brookdale-G] /GE Chipset Integrated Graphics Device (rev 01), Multimedia audio controller: Intel Corp. 82801DB/DBL/DBM (ICH4/ICH4-L/ICH4-M) AC'97 Audio Controller (rev 01), Ethernet controller: Intel Corp. 82801BD PRO/100 VE (LOM) Ethernet Controller (rev 81)
2005-04-16T10:40:00.000Z	i3dmaster		those are the main hardware
2005-04-16T10:40:00.000Z	Dreamer3	i3dmaster	well, do what i said (blank screen) and see if that solves it
2005-04-16T10:40:00.000Z	Dreamer3	i3dmaster	then if so you can start looking at  your graphics situation
2005-04-16T10:40:00.000Z	i3dmaster		I wonder where I can look at
2005-04-16T10:40:00.000Z	Dreamer3	i3dmaster	if that doesn't solve it it could be something else entirely, so i'd change it and come back to it later
2005-04-16T10:41:00.000Z	i3dmaster	Dreamer3	ok, I will try to put it to black screen or maybe I will just log out today and see what happens
