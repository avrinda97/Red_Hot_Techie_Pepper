2006-03-01T16:01:00.000Z	pilgrim		I installed windows after ubuntu and now I can't boot into ubuntu. What do I do.
2006-03-01T16:02:00.000Z	dyrne	pilgrim	do you have a livecd?
2006-03-01T16:02:00.000Z	pilgrim	dyrne	no just installation cd.
2006-03-01T16:02:00.000Z	pilgrim	dyrne	no I just got installation cd
2006-03-01T16:03:00.000Z	dyrne	pilgrim	youll probably want to burn either knoppix or ubuntu livecd although you can reinstall grub from floppy
2006-03-01T16:04:00.000Z	pilgrim	dyrne	I'm not a complete newbie, I'm not affraid to work from command line. I've done this before just forgot the sequence of events.
2006-03-01T16:04:00.000Z	dyrne	pilgrim	checkout https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
2006-03-01T16:04:00.000Z	pilgrim	dyrne	thanks.
2007-03-20T11:31:00.000Z	dyrne	pilgrim	free will tell you then you can just swapon /dev/something
2007-03-20T11:33:00.000Z	pilgrim	dyrne	so just do free /dev/hda2 (which is my swap)?
2007-03-20T11:34:00.000Z	dyrne	pilgrim	just free  if it shows swap youre fine if not you need to sudo swapon   then make sure its in fstab as well for reboot
2007-03-20T11:35:00.000Z	dyrne	pilgrim	is it a big app? we talking like over 2 or 4 gigs mem needed?
2007-03-20T11:35:00.000Z	pilgrim	dyrne	free shows swap like this: Swap:            0          0          0
2007-03-20T11:35:00.000Z	pilgrim	dyrne	it's eclipse
2007-03-20T11:35:00.000Z	dyrne	pilgrim	yeah you need to set swap then.  also gksudo gedit /etc/fstab  and add an entry there for it so its auto used next reboot
2007-03-20T11:36:00.000Z	pilgrim	dyrne	and fstab is using some UUID crap that is like a code it's not /dev/hda2 or something simple
2007-03-20T11:36:00.000Z	dyrne	pilgrim	you can use uui or replace with hda2 or whatever
2007-03-20T11:36:00.000Z	pilgrim	dyrne	# /dev/hda2 -- converted during upgrade to edgy
2007-03-20T11:37:00.000Z	pilgrim	dyrne	how do I obtain the uuid of /dev/hda2?
2007-03-20T11:37:00.000Z	dyrne	pilgrim	honestly id remove the uuid and just do /dev/hda2
2007-03-20T11:37:00.000Z	pilgrim	dyrne	but the rest of fstab has UUID
