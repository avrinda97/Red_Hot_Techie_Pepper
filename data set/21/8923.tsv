2005-12-15T12:34:00.000Z	runevi		Hmf.  Ubuntu seems to be far more difficult to build packages on for non-developers, than for example SuSE.
2005-12-15T12:35:00.000Z	runevi		With SuSE I just select the huge 'development' package-group, and i can compile almost everything at once.
2005-12-15T12:36:00.000Z	Xenguy	runevi	checkinstall allows you to build deb packages (and rpms) from source
2005-12-15T12:35:00.000Z	Xenguy	runevi	you can 'cheat' with 'checkinstall'
2005-12-15T12:35:00.000Z	runevi	Xenguy	Explain, please. :-)
2005-12-15T12:36:00.000Z	Xenguy	runevi	otherwise, yes it is more demanding than rolling RPMs AFAIK
2005-12-15T12:36:00.000Z	runevi	Xenguy	Uhm, I don't even want to roll rpm's.. i just want to do "configure; make; make install" ;)
2005-12-15T12:36:00.000Z	runevi	Xenguy	But most of the time, it seems I have to hunt down libraries and stuff.
2005-12-15T12:36:00.000Z	Xenguy	runevi	oh, definitely checkout 'checkinstall' then
2005-12-15T12:37:00.000Z	runevi	Xenguy	doing now.
2005-12-15T12:37:00.000Z	Xenguy	runevi	yes, you'll have to satisfy dependencies to compile, as usual
2005-12-15T12:37:00.000Z	runevi	Xenguy	Yups, but a lot of the really really basic stuff seems to be missing by default in ubuntu .. which is a pain ;)
2005-12-15T12:37:00.000Z	Xenguy	runevi	example?
2005-12-15T12:38:00.000Z	runevi	Xenguy	gcc
2005-12-15T12:38:00.000Z	Xenguy	runevi	apt-get install build-essential
2005-12-15T12:38:00.000Z	Xenguy	runevi	(IIRC)
2005-12-15T12:38:00.000Z	runevi	Xenguy	did that.. and just installed libxv-dev .. which also seems like it should be there by default :)
2005-12-15T12:38:00.000Z	Xenguy	runevi	meh
2005-12-15T12:39:00.000Z	runevi	Xenguy	I know, i know. :)  Can't satisfy everybody.
2005-12-15T12:39:00.000Z	Xenguy	runevi	;-)
2005-12-15T12:41:00.000Z	runevi	Xenguy	But it would be really nice for us linux "amateurs" who've been using various distro for .. 8+ years .. :-)  to have an easy-to-install package that just shoveled in most of the necessities. :)
