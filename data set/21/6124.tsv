2007-06-19T09:14:00.000Z	shiester_miester	livecd	how does it not boot?
2007-06-19T09:14:00.000Z	livecd	shiester_miester	it says error loading operating system, I assume that's a grub problem
2007-06-19T09:15:00.000Z	shiester_miester	livecd	at what point does the error occur? does the grub menu come up?
2007-06-19T09:15:00.000Z	livecd	shiester_miester	no grub menu... I don't think
2007-06-19T09:16:00.000Z	shiester_miester	livecd	does it even say "loading GRUB" or anything like that?
2007-06-19T09:16:00.000Z	livecd	shiester_miester	I don't think it did... I'm on the liveCD now so it would take a while to verify, but I'm pretty sure that it didn't
2007-06-19T09:17:00.000Z	shiester_miester	livecd	is it booting from the right hard drive
2007-06-19T09:17:00.000Z	livecd	shiester_miester	I think there's only one hard-drive
2007-06-19T09:19:00.000Z	livecd	shiester_miester	so assuming it's booting from the right hard-drive, and that it doesn't get to GRUB, what kind of problem am I looking at here??
2007-06-19T09:19:00.000Z	shiester_miester	livecd	i have no idea...i assume you partitioned it properly and installed correctly?
2007-06-19T09:20:00.000Z	shiester_miester	livecd	can you explain how you partitioned it
2007-06-19T09:20:00.000Z	livecd	shiester_miester	I used the automatic option,  let it split the disk in half as it does by default and then let it run
2007-06-19T09:21:00.000Z	livecd	shiester_miester	Then I tried again, to repartition that half and the liveCD just borked
2007-06-19T09:21:00.000Z	shiester_miester	livecd	i have no idea how the automatic partitioner works, but if there was a partition on it before it may have just killed it.  try reinstalling ubuntu and partitioning it manually?
2007-06-19T09:23:00.000Z	livecd	shiester_miester	I can try it again... if it fails again I'll just come back here.... actually.. since I'm at their house in Worcester on vacation... is there a loCo team for Massachussettes?
