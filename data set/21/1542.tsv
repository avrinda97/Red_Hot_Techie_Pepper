2010-08-06T22:16:00.000Z	lojack	vipinb	Does your question relate to a mediacenter PC?
2010-08-06T22:17:00.000Z	vipinb	lojack	I'm using ubuntu 10.04  when ever I play sound in my system my syslog is populated with "Ratelimit.c: 92 events suppressed" message
2010-08-06T22:19:00.000Z	lojack	vipinb	Do you have a souundcard with an LCD?
2010-08-06T22:20:00.000Z	lojack	vipinb	Or something similar?
2010-08-06T22:20:00.000Z	vipinb	lojack	I did not understood your question. But I have onboard sound card
2010-08-06T22:23:00.000Z	lojack	vipinb	Its definately a pulseaudio issue, though a lot of people with VCDs have reported though entries in syslog.
2010-08-06T22:23:00.000Z	lojack	vipinb	...those entries in syslog.
2010-08-06T22:26:00.000Z	vipinb	lojack	I also agree with it. In my system I have 4 speaker. i have seleted profile as analog duplex. Still my 4 speaker is working by that time this is not populating. But when I select profile  analog sourroudning 4.0 out. I'm getting this messages
2010-08-06T22:28:00.000Z	lojack	vipinb	grep the log for pulseaudio and see of there are any good messages before the ratelimit* entries
2010-08-06T22:29:00.000Z	vipinb	lojack	yes  when i change back the profile to sourround 4.0 output and check before ratelimit* entries there are messages
2010-08-06T22:32:00.000Z	vipinb	lojack	: You can check this link to find out the messages before ratelimit* entries http://pastebin.com/pfgBT9XJ
2010-08-06T22:34:00.000Z	lojack	vipinb	Oh, alsa issues?
2010-08-06T22:34:00.000Z	vipinb	lojack	what should i Do to fix this
2010-08-06T22:35:00.000Z	lojack	vipinb	Are your alsa and pulseaudio packages up to date?
2010-08-06T22:36:00.000Z	vipinb	lojack	I'm using the latest ubuntu 10.04 with all update. That  mean my pulse and alsa will be up to date??
2010-08-06T22:37:00.000Z	lojack	vipinb	Yes, it does.
2010-08-06T22:37:00.000Z	lojack	vipinb	Obviously your problem is related to sound (drivers).  I can't help any more than that.  Try posting to Ubuntu forums and see if anyone outside of IRC can help?
2010-08-06T22:37:00.000Z	vipinb	lojack	thank you.. I will try that
2010-08-06T22:37:00.000Z	lojack	vipinb	It is very frustrating when you can find an answer to a question, I know.
2010-08-06T22:39:00.000Z	vipinb	lojack	when I disable pulse i'm not getting this problem. But my issue is I want a volume control like in Ubuntu 8.04 . Here in 10.04 Volume control support Only pulse audio. If you have any idea on this can you help me
2010-08-06T22:40:00.000Z	lojack	vipinb	Sorry, I don't know.  I wish I could help you.
