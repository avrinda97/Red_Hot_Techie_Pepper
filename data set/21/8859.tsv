2005-12-28T10:47:00.000Z	Yv12345vY		hello, i just installed ubuntu on a centrino alienware 1.6ghz 1gb ram 60gb 7200rpm hdd but it runs painfully slow.  i upgraded to the 686 kernel.  the cpu load is 100% and hdd is constantly spinning until i kill any acpi/power related processes.  but even afterwards it still feels sluggish.  any help is appreciated.
2005-12-28T10:47:00.000Z	martianpenguin	Yv12345vY	I have the same situation... but it runs fine for me
2005-12-28T10:48:00.000Z	Yv12345vY	martianpenguin	what do you mean?
2005-12-28T10:48:00.000Z	martianpenguin	Yv12345vY	I'm on an alienware laptop 1.6 centrino, however mine seems to be running faster than windows was on this before...
2005-12-28T10:48:00.000Z	Yv12345vY	martianpenguin	interesting, did you do any setup/config on ubuntu??
2005-12-28T10:49:00.000Z	martianpenguin	Yv12345vY	nope, took about half an hour to install
2005-12-28T10:49:00.000Z	Yv12345vY	martianpenguin	mine took more than 2
2005-12-28T10:49:00.000Z	martianpenguin	Yv12345vY	only problem i have is the 2.6.15 kernel has a broken touchpad driver
2005-12-28T10:49:00.000Z	Yv12345vY	martianpenguin	i'm running 2.6.12 686
2005-12-28T10:50:00.000Z	martianpenguin	Yv12345vY	im running the 386 kernel
2005-12-28T10:51:00.000Z	Yv12345vY	martianpenguin	interesting
2005-12-28T10:51:00.000Z	Yv12345vY	martianpenguin	would it be a good idea to try and reinstall it??
2005-12-28T10:51:00.000Z	martianpenguin	Yv12345vY	if you think it's slow, i would try the 386
2005-12-28T10:52:00.000Z	Yv12345vY	martianpenguin	i was running the 386, somebody on the forums suggested i go to 686 and it helped a tiny bit but nothing significant
2005-12-28T10:52:00.000Z	martianpenguin	Yv12345vY	that seems weird
2005-12-28T10:52:00.000Z	Yv12345vY	martianpenguin	i'm pulling down the dvd image and i'll try again
2005-12-28T10:53:00.000Z	martianpenguin	Yv12345vY	doesn't it fit on a cd?
2005-12-28T10:53:00.000Z	Yv12345vY	martianpenguin	it does
2005-12-28T10:53:00.000Z	martianpenguin	Yv12345vY	how much ram do you have?
2005-12-28T10:55:00.000Z	Yv12345vY	martianpenguin	thanks for your help man i'm going to try and do a reinstall
2005-12-28T10:55:00.000Z	martianpenguin	Yv12345vY	good luck
