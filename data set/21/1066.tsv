2011-02-15T12:54:00.000Z	kiwilatham		I think mount.cifs replaces mount.smbfs
2011-02-15T12:55:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	kiwilatham	so mount.cifs uses the same command structure as mount.smbfs and supports the same options, etc.?
2011-02-15T13:08:00.000Z	kiwilatham	TheMusicGuy	are you mounting a FAT32 or NTFS filesystem?
2011-02-15T12:57:00.000Z	kiwilatham	TheMusicGuy	I use mount.cifs with the -o switches to specify username and password at work to mount Windows2003 shares from inside redhat linux.  I am sure ubuntu is the same.
2011-02-15T12:59:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	kiwilatham	it seems that mount.smbfs is an alias for mount.cifs (same with man mount.smbfs)
2011-02-15T13:00:00.000Z	kiwilatham	TheMusicGuy	yeah.  I guessed so.  On my system mount.smbfs does not exist. But then I use a different distro.
2011-02-15T13:00:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	kiwilatham	I was just wondering because I'm having some issues with file ownership and I thought it might be because I was using the wrong filesystem.
2011-02-15T13:02:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	kiwilatham	also there isn't a "cifs.conf" in any of the man pages, only "smb.conf". It seems...inconsistent.
2011-02-15T13:05:00.000Z	kiwilatham	TheMusicGuy	file ownership and filesystem would be a new one for me.  Have you checked everything else?  IE: chown and chmod?  Does ubuntu have SELINUX or an equivalent that is getting in your way?
2011-02-15T13:07:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	kiwilatham	I can mount the filesystem without any problem, but everything is owned by root and it should be owned by another user. Attempting to chown/chgrp does nothing
2011-02-15T13:08:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	kiwilatham	same with chmod
2011-02-15T13:09:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	kiwilatham	ntfs
2011-02-15T13:16:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	kiwilatham	no...its a partition on the internal HD that is being accessed over the network.
2011-02-15T13:19:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	kiwilatham	according to the man pages, won't that force _everything_ in the share to have the same uid/gid? (That's not what I want)
2011-02-15T13:21:00.000Z	kiwilatham	TheMusicGuy	Look, I dont really know.  It would appear that your client does not support Unix extentions.  If you dont specify the UID / GID then the file permissions will be those of the user that executed mount.  Is there a way to configure mount to be executed by a non root user?
2011-02-15T13:23:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	kiwilatham	My server is WIndows 7 Pro. My client is Ubuntu. I don't know what Win 7 supports. I thought it supported the Unix extensions, maybe it doesn't.
2011-02-15T13:25:00.000Z	kiwilatham	TheMusicGuy	Maybe you should just give it a go huh?  Try the fstab users option on the mount.  That should allow you to mount the thing as a normal user.  Alternatively try it with the commandline and see if it works.
2011-02-15T13:28:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	kiwilatham	Listen. Setting the uid, gid, and users options does indeed do exactly what you say it should do. I already tried it. However, that isn't the issue here. I can't just mount everything in the share with the same uid/gid and file permissions; that doesn't work for what I'm ultimately trying to do. I need separate ownership and permission bits for each file.
