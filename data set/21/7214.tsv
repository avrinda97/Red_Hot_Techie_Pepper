2006-11-09T07:10:00.000Z	dings		What could be the reason for 'ssh -X' not setting DISPLAY?
2006-11-09T07:10:00.000Z	chuckyp	dings	you need to enable another Xserver for ssh
2006-11-09T07:12:00.000Z	dings	chuckyp	not sure I got that. I have a client with X.org running and a server with X11forwarding. But "client> ssh -X me@server" does not set DISPLAY on the server.
2006-11-09T07:12:00.000Z	chuckyp	dings	actually enable X forwarding on the server.
2006-11-09T07:13:00.000Z	chuckyp	dings	just make sure you edit etc/ssh/sshd_config  and X forwarding is enabled on the server.  Then maybe try "ssh -X -2 username@server"
2006-11-09T07:13:00.000Z	dings	chuckyp	It is and I only allow -2.
2006-11-09T07:14:00.000Z	chuckyp	dings	try xhost + on the server and try it again.
2006-11-09T07:14:00.000Z	dings	chuckyp	eh.. suddenly realised that I probably need some x.org packages on the server
2006-11-09T07:14:00.000Z	chuckyp	dings	I mean on yoru system
2006-11-09T07:14:00.000Z	dings	chuckyp	Im not about to open X on my system
2006-11-09T07:15:00.000Z	chuckyp	dings	yeah lol you need those.  But if you get a cannot display error you can try "xhost +" to release the local box.
2006-11-09T07:15:00.000Z	dings	chuckyp	that is not an option
2006-11-09T07:15:00.000Z	chuckyp	dings	well you need x packages on the server
2006-11-09T07:16:00.000Z	dings	chuckyp	remember wich, I shouldn't need to acctually run an xserver.
2006-11-09T07:16:00.000Z	chuckyp	dings	No you don't actually need to run X but you need the X environment on the server.  Just don't launch it.
2006-11-09T07:17:00.000Z	dings	chuckyp	isn't there some "-xorg-common" or something that would be enough?
2006-11-09T07:17:00.000Z	chuckyp	dings	there should be let me check
2006-11-09T07:32:00.000Z	dings	chuckyp	no, I can't believe I need to have an xserver installed to provide x-forwarding. Are you sure? shouldn't it be enough with what on Debian would be xlibs?
2006-11-09T07:32:00.000Z	chuckyp	dings	whats the point of x forwarding if you have nothing to forward?
2006-11-09T07:33:00.000Z	dings	chuckyp	I will have X applications forwarded to my local x-server
2006-11-09T07:33:00.000Z	chuckyp	dings	the server needs to be able to launch the x apps.
