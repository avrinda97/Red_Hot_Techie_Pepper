2008-01-28T19:25:00.000Z	Nik0la0s		so everytime you say the acronym MTA what i must understand is a Mail Server Correct?
2008-01-28T19:25:00.000Z	bascule	Nik0la0s	the MTA actually sends the mail in the correct format to wherever it needs to go
2008-01-28T19:27:00.000Z	bascule	Nik0la0s	well if you had a domain and wanted inboxes for users you would need a mail server, however you need the right software to send mail, no recieve it
2008-01-28T19:30:00.000Z	bascule	Nik0la0s	no, a client is like outlook express or murr or pine, the agent can send the mail from these clients
2008-01-28T19:31:00.000Z	bascule	Nik0la0s	correct, there are many clients that all need an agent
2008-01-28T19:37:00.000Z	bascule	Nik0la0s	sure, the mail server running on the recieving end and puts it in the users mailbox
2008-01-28T19:38:00.000Z	bascule	Nik0la0s	think of MTA as a send only mail server
2008-01-28T19:51:00.000Z	bascule	Nik0la0s	mail server send and recieve
2008-01-28T19:53:00.000Z	bascule	Nik0la0s	I didn't say it was, just think of it that way, to me it becomes a server and not just an agent at the point it recieves mail ... :)
2008-01-28T19:57:00.000Z	bascule	Nik0la0s	there is no such thing, it's just a daemon
2008-01-28T19:58:00.000Z	bascule	Nik0la0s	lol, you need a cli client that knows of your MTA daemon to send mail in the SMTP format to some server
2008-01-28T19:58:00.000Z	bascule	Nik0la0s	sure
