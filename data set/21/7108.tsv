2006-11-28T10:05:00.000Z	sanityx	Dominian	Ubuntu is a live cd.
2006-11-28T10:05:00.000Z	Dominian	sanityx	oh?
2006-11-28T10:05:00.000Z	sanityx	Dominian	Kind of, except that its actually MEANT to be installed.
2006-11-28T10:06:00.000Z	Dominian	sanityx	ahh ok
2006-11-28T10:06:00.000Z	sanityx	Dominian	It just comes in live cd form so you can test it out.
2006-11-28T10:06:00.000Z	Dominian	sanityx	nice
2006-11-28T10:06:00.000Z	sanityx	Dominian	i.e. the installer runs off the live cd. but its a full desktop distrobution. the most popular one currently in fact.
2006-11-28T10:06:00.000Z	Dominian	sanityx	No offense, but popularity means nothing to me ... usability does.
2006-11-28T10:07:00.000Z	Dominian	sanityx	as a systems administrator... usability counts for greater than popularity
2006-11-28T10:07:00.000Z	sanityx	Dominian	Why do you think its so popular?
2006-11-28T10:07:00.000Z	Dominian	sanityx	Frankly, I don't care, honestly.
2006-11-28T10:07:00.000Z	sanityx	Dominian	Best hardware detection of any distro ive ever tried.
2006-11-28T10:08:00.000Z	Dominian	sanityx	slax does quite well
2006-11-28T10:08:00.000Z	sanityx	Dominian	Yup it does. But not as well as ubuntu.
2006-11-28T10:08:00.000Z	Dominian	sanityx	gentoo detects perfectly
2006-11-28T10:08:00.000Z	sanityx	Dominian	All distros detect perfectly on SOME systems.
2006-11-28T10:09:00.000Z	sanityx	Dominian	Slackware doesnt auomatically configure nearly as much as ubuntu.
2006-11-28T10:09:00.000Z	Dominian	sanityx	no, but I know how to configure my hardware via slackware.. so that doesn't impress me
2006-11-28T10:09:00.000Z	sanityx	Dominian	the fact that you know how isnt the point. you asked about usability. thats usability
2006-11-28T10:10:00.000Z	Dominian	sanityx	true
2006-11-28T10:10:00.000Z	Dominian	sanityx	but you are trying to convince *me* lol
