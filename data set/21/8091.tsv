2006-06-09T13:33:00.000Z	grasshopper		Guys! any of you know sysvconfig?
2006-06-09T13:34:00.000Z	grasshopper		In SYSVCONFIG theres bluez-utils, is that for bluetooth? (trying to disable it)
2006-06-09T13:35:00.000Z	grasshopper		Hello? any of you know whether bluez-utils in sysvconfig corresponds to bluetooth?
2006-06-09T13:36:00.000Z	P0ldy	grasshopper	BlueZ - Official Linux Bluetooth protocol stack.  First google hit
2006-06-09T13:36:00.000Z	grasshopper	P0ldy	do you know sysvconfig?
2006-06-09T13:37:00.000Z	grasshopper	P0ldy	? i can disbable bluez-tooth there in sysvconfig would that disable bluetooth?
2006-06-09T13:38:00.000Z	P0ldy	grasshopper	No, I use sysv-rc-conf.
2006-06-09T13:38:00.000Z	P0ldy	grasshopper	Most likely yes it would disable bluetooth
2006-06-09T13:40:00.000Z	grasshopper	P0ldy	is sysv-rc-conf better to use or ?...
2006-06-09T13:40:00.000Z	P0ldy	grasshopper	really couldn't say because I've never used the other.  I find it simple enough though
2006-06-09T13:41:00.000Z	grasshopper	P0ldy	is it sudo apt-get install sysv-rc-conf
2006-06-09T13:42:00.000Z	P0ldy	grasshopper	yes
2006-06-09T13:44:00.000Z	P0ldy	grasshopper	after you install sysv-rc-conf, you might like this thread. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=89491
2006-06-09T13:44:00.000Z	grasshopper	P0ldy	thx man
