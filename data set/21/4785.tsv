2009-04-16T23:44:00.000Z	GunbladeIV	aaron	Chrystallic was talking about your browser.. is it firefox or opera?
2009-04-16T23:45:00.000Z	GunbladeIV	aaron	firefox is the default browser for ubuntu, just in case you are using other than firefox.
2009-04-16T23:46:00.000Z	GunbladeIV	aaron	some of the videos become laggy ? is it happen randomly or to specific videos?
2009-04-16T23:47:00.000Z	GunbladeIV	aaron	i see, so i think you might have to reinstall your flash plugin in my opinion, try reinstalling the flash plugin and look if anything change
2009-04-16T23:48:00.000Z	GunbladeIV	aaron	i tdont think that network interface is the cause of this laggy problem.
2009-04-16T23:49:00.000Z	GunbladeIV	aaron	i think it might be codec/flash plugin problems
2009-04-16T23:50:00.000Z	GunbladeIV	aaron	are you using 9.04 beta?
2009-04-16T23:52:00.000Z	GunbladeIV	aaron	just reinstall the plugin will do the trick
2009-04-16T23:52:00.000Z	GunbladeIV	aaron	tell me if it's work
2009-04-16T23:53:00.000Z	GunbladeIV	aaron	i will try to help you if it doesnt work
2009-04-17T00:19:00.000Z	GunbladeIV	aaron	please go to #ubuntu-offtopic for non-help discussion
