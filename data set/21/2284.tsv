2009-11-19T01:56:00.000Z	vonnick		I don't think so
2009-11-19T01:56:00.000Z	vonnick		Adobe still thinks 64-bit doesn't exist
2009-11-19T01:58:00.000Z	vonnick		Ask your brother :)
2009-11-19T01:59:00.000Z	vonnick		I tried upgrading, I killed it at 3 hours
2009-11-19T01:59:00.000Z	smokie	vonnick	upgrading to 9.10?
2009-11-19T01:59:00.000Z	vonnick		Yeah
2009-11-19T01:59:00.000Z	smokie	vonnick	what was taking too long? the download or the install itself?
2009-11-19T01:59:00.000Z	vonnick		The download
2009-11-19T01:59:00.000Z	smokie		damn
2009-11-19T02:00:00.000Z	smokie	vonnick	so you didnt upgrade yet? or you just did a fresh install?
2009-11-19T02:00:00.000Z	vonnick		Fresh install, like always
2009-11-19T02:01:00.000Z	smokie	vonnick	hmm so you had to recompile all your applications and settings and so on?
2009-11-19T02:01:00.000Z	smokie		kinda sucks
2009-11-19T02:02:00.000Z	vonnick	smokie	I make a list and reinstall everything, yeah
2009-11-19T02:03:00.000Z	smokie	vonnick	what about user settings, network settings and so on, can those b backed up and restored later on a fresh install?
2009-11-19T02:03:00.000Z	vonnick		I dunno, I don't bother with that stuff
2009-11-19T02:04:00.000Z	smokie	vonnick	its a hassle for me cuz i have a dns server and a local website running on my 9.04
2009-11-19T02:04:00.000Z	smokie		i guess ill just stick with it for now till im forced to upgrade
2009-11-19T02:04:00.000Z	vonnick		Well, would it be possible for you to duplicate your setup on another machine?
2009-11-19T02:04:00.000Z	vonnick		So you can test the upgrade
2009-11-19T02:05:00.000Z	smokie	vonnick	i dont know.. i guess i can create an image of the partition and run it on a VM
