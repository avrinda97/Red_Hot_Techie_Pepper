2011-01-20T21:35:00.000Z	purpz		Ack so sorry.
2011-01-20T21:36:00.000Z	purpz		I didn't realize.
2011-01-20T21:38:00.000Z	IdleOne	purpz	have you tried asking in #eggdrop about your bot issue?
2011-01-20T21:39:00.000Z	purpz	IdleOne	I hadn't...I presumed it was a permissions problem
2011-01-20T21:40:00.000Z	IdleOne	purpz	looks like a permissions problem but i am wondering why those two .tcl files went missing. #eggdrop probably can help explain it
2011-01-20T21:42:00.000Z	purpz	IdleOne	If I can get it back to where that's happening I can ask there...:)
2011-01-20T21:42:00.000Z	IdleOne	purpz	then in that case undoing the chown should get you back to the previous error
2011-01-20T21:46:00.000Z	purpz	IdleOne	undecim I ran 'sudo chown -R root:root eggdrop' from /usr/share and I now getting "./eggdrop: is a directory" when I run './eggdrop;
2011-01-20T21:47:00.000Z	IdleOne	purpz	well you don't want eggdrop owned by root
2011-01-20T21:47:00.000Z	purpz	IdleOne	Nope, i don't...
2011-01-20T21:47:00.000Z	IdleOne		so change it back to your user
2011-01-20T21:48:00.000Z	purpz	IdleOne	K, so I ran 'sudo chown -R username:username eggdrop'
2011-01-20T21:49:00.000Z	IdleOne	purpz	now ./eggdrop
2011-01-20T21:49:00.000Z	purpz	IdleOne	./eggdrop is a directory
2011-01-20T21:50:00.000Z	IdleOne	purpz	you have run the bot before right? I don't remember the command to start the bot. something -m botname.conf I think
2011-01-20T21:50:00.000Z	purpz	IdleOne	Yes, it was working before I started tinkering with this
2011-01-20T21:52:00.000Z	IdleOne	purpz	it has been so long since I ran eggdrop, I really think you would be better off asking in #eggdrop and hope you get a sympathetic user to help you even though they might say it isn't their problem.
2011-01-20T21:52:00.000Z	purpz	IdleOne	Ok, will shoot over there and see, thanks for your time.
