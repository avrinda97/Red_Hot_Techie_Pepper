2006-07-09T13:19:00.000Z	synd1		Is there a page that tells you what EXACTLY to do when you are trying to install Ubuntu on a laptop and properly partion that hard drive?
2006-07-09T13:20:00.000Z	synd1		Anyone?
2006-07-09T13:20:00.000Z	gdb	synd1	What about the defaul layout is not acceptable?
2006-07-09T13:21:00.000Z	synd1	gdb	I can't blow away the XP partition
2006-07-09T13:21:00.000Z	gdb	synd1	So don't?
2006-07-09T13:21:00.000Z	synd1	gdb	I need a walkthru for someone who
2006-07-09T13:21:00.000Z	gdb	synd1	Have you actually tried running the installer?
2006-07-09T13:21:00.000Z	synd1	gdb	I need a walkthru for someone who's never done this before
2006-07-09T13:22:00.000Z	synd1	gdb	Yes, I have. I've been running Ubuntu since Warty
2006-07-09T13:22:00.000Z	gdb	synd1	If there is free space on the disk, there is nothing else you need to do.  The installer will give the option to "Leave existing partitions in place and use available space for installation".  If you're looking to resize your XP because you have no free space, then yes, you'll want to use gparted.
2006-07-09T13:23:00.000Z	gdb	synd1	The installaer in Dapper is a lot different than previous releases.
2006-07-09T13:24:00.000Z	gdb	synd1	In so much as it's pointy clicky and runs as an application under the live desktop.  The partitioner is a bit easier to use as well.
2006-07-09T13:26:00.000Z	synd1	gdb	So gparted runs under the live desktop?
2006-07-09T13:26:00.000Z	gdb	synd1	I can't say if the live CD comes with a repartitioning program, but you can certainly install one once running the live desktop in order to manipulate your disks.
2006-07-09T13:27:00.000Z	synd1	gdb	Ah, OK.
2006-07-09T13:28:00.000Z	gdb	synd1	It's nice using the live CD for this because you get a "full install of Ubuntu" that doesn't keep your hard disks in use, and thus in a state where they can't be modified by partitioning software.
2006-07-09T13:29:00.000Z	gdb	synd1	As for actually using gparted, I've not done so for.... almost 10 years. ;-)  So I can't really offer much advice beyond "boot the live CD, install the partition editing software, and go from there."
2006-07-09T13:29:00.000Z	gdb	synd1	You should be able, however, to get back on IRC from the booted live CD.
2006-07-09T13:30:00.000Z	synd1	gdb	Ah, that's the other thing. The Live CD doesn't detect the wireless card :/
2006-07-09T13:31:00.000Z	gdb	synd1	doh!  The easiest work around, if it's possible for you, would be to plug in an Ethernet cable.  As for getting wireless running on Linux, that's not something I've tackled so I can't advise you further on it.
2006-07-09T13:31:00.000Z	gdb	synd1	(I'm sure there are others in here who can, though). ;-)
