2007-08-08T09:54:00.000Z	summer_s4		when i try to run sudo apt-get install flex bison, it gives me an error saying i have to manually run dpkg --configure -a
2007-08-08T09:54:00.000Z	summer_s4		but when i try to do that it says i need superuser access
2007-08-08T09:54:00.000Z	summer_s4		but i am on the admin
2007-08-08T09:55:00.000Z	summer_s4		how do i log in as root
2007-08-08T09:55:00.000Z	summer_s4		skiessi: well i need to
2007-08-08T09:56:00.000Z	gordonjcp	summer_s4	you almost never need to log in as root
2007-08-08T09:56:00.000Z	summer_s4		well right now i do.
2007-08-08T09:56:00.000Z	gordonjcp	summer_s4	what exactly are you trying to do?
2007-08-08T09:57:00.000Z	summer_s4	gordonjcp	dpkg --configure -a
2007-08-08T09:58:00.000Z	gordonjcp	summer_s4	what v3ctor said
2007-08-08T09:58:00.000Z	summer_s4		skiessi: i just ran sudo login root
2007-08-08T09:58:00.000Z	gordonjcp	summer_s4	did you read what the bot posted to you?
2007-08-08T09:58:00.000Z	gordonjcp		!root > summer_s4
2007-08-08T09:58:00.000Z	gordonjcp		!sudo | summer_s4
2007-08-08T09:58:00.000Z	summer_s4	gordonjcp	yes i read the link and went down to were i could login as root
2007-08-08T09:59:00.000Z	gordonjcp	summer_s4	you should not ever have to actually log in as root
2007-08-08T10:00:00.000Z	summer_s4		well... it helps sometimes
2007-08-08T10:00:00.000Z	gordonjcp	summer_s4	sudo -i will pop you into a root shell, which should be the most you should do
2007-08-08T10:00:00.000Z	gordonjcp	summer_s4	I have actually set my install up to allow me to log in as root, but that was for a single very very very very very specific problem
2007-08-08T10:01:00.000Z	summer_s4	gordonjcp	i have my problome
2007-08-08T10:01:00.000Z	summer_s4	gordonjcp	done
