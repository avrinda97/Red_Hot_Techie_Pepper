2009-09-11T07:00:00.000Z	Ben64		more linux share = more linux games = more linux share = .............    [windows is dead]
2009-09-11T07:02:00.000Z	Ben64		virtual machines suck, requires you to buy windows still
2009-09-11T07:03:00.000Z	Ben64		i know tons of people who would use linux only, if it weren't for the game compatibility issues
2009-09-11T07:03:00.000Z	Ben64		then software developers would be required to make everything compatible with linux, or lose money
2009-09-11T07:04:00.000Z	Ben64		sebner: yep, but the gamers have the ability to tip the scales, imo
2009-09-11T07:05:00.000Z	Ben64		argh my screen is exploding
2009-09-11T07:06:00.000Z	Ben64		can i borrow someone's computer for some rendering? my cpu is slow..
2009-09-11T07:07:00.000Z	jrib	Ben64	that's not really on-topic here
2009-10-30T04:54:00.000Z	jrib	Ben64	ahem "flawlessly"
2010-10-15T17:27:00.000Z	Ben64	jrib	cron still isnt gonna launch gui in that method
2010-10-15T17:27:00.000Z	jrib	Ben64	sure it will
2010-10-15T17:28:00.000Z	jrib	Ben64	we're probably talking about different things.  I pointed phanindra to the cron page on ubuntu's wiki that explains the need to set DISPLAY.   That should work right?
2010-10-15T17:28:00.000Z	Ben64	jrib	oh i thought you just said to make the script executable
2010-10-15T17:29:00.000Z	jrib	Ben64	right, he should /also/ do that because he has a shebang line for bash and is sending it to dash.  You're right, it's not related to launching a gui application
2012-08-29T16:18:00.000Z	jrib	Ben64	yes, sometime between now and april 2013 you should find a convenient time to upgrade to 12.04 and find a nice environment you enjoy
2012-08-29T16:20:00.000Z	jrib	Ben64	you can't use gnome-2 exactly, but there are a few similar options
2012-09-27T14:10:00.000Z	Ben64	jrib	should maybe not keep posting it : /
2012-11-28T04:43:00.000Z	Ben64	jrib	no it isn't
2012-11-28T04:43:00.000Z	jrib	Ben64	yes it is :/
2012-11-28T04:43:00.000Z	jrib	Ben64	-2^2 = -(2^2) = -4
2012-11-28T04:44:00.000Z	jrib	Ben64	no.
