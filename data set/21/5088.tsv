2007-12-30T10:41:00.000Z	flexgrip		nope. is that because it is trying to ping through wlan0 and the xbox is connected to eth0?
2007-12-30T10:43:00.000Z	snugg	flexgrip	both sides have to have a route toward each other
2007-12-30T10:45:00.000Z	snugg	flexgrip	thats correct, how you set that in your xbox, i dont know
2007-12-30T10:46:00.000Z	flexgrip	snugg	that is the way its set. I have the xbox's gateway set to that of eth0.
2007-12-30T10:47:00.000Z	snugg	flexgrip	its okay for the xbox to have the eth0 of ubuntu to be its gateway or 0.0.0.0 since there are only two of them on that subnet
2007-12-30T10:55:00.000Z	snugg	flexgrip	is ubuntu providing the dns  services?
2007-12-30T10:55:00.000Z	flexgrip	snugg	no my router is
2007-12-30T10:56:00.000Z	snugg	flexgrip	but your ubuntu is in-between your router and xbox right?
2007-12-30T11:04:00.000Z	snugg	flexgrip	it will not work because they are in different subnets, the dns server in your router is not getting the correct request from xbox
2007-12-30T11:07:00.000Z	snugg	flexgrip	what subnet is xbox and what subnet is wlan0 at?
2007-12-30T11:09:00.000Z	snugg	flexgrip	that will not work unless you have setup the ubuntu to do something special, i forget what it is called,
2007-12-30T11:09:00.000Z	snugg	flexgrip	i suggest putting the xbox into like 192.168.200.x and leave the wlan0 at that 192.168.1.x
2007-12-30T11:09:00.000Z	flexgrip	snugg	basically im trying to share my internet connection on wlan0 to my xbox on eth0
2007-12-30T11:10:00.000Z	flexgrip	snugg	should i set eth0 to that subnet as well?
2007-12-30T11:10:00.000Z	snugg	flexgrip	i know you want to share, just do it differently thats all
2007-12-30T11:10:00.000Z	snugg	flexgrip	off course being eth0 is in same subnet as the xbox
2007-12-30T11:16:00.000Z	flexgrip	snugg	ok i set eth0 and the xbox on a diff subnet. then told the xbox that the dns server was eth0 wlan0 my router and my real dns server ip and none of them worked.
2007-12-30T11:17:00.000Z	snugg	flexgrip	you still need to run port forwarding in your ubuntu and perhaps even run dhcpd server plus NAT
2007-12-30T11:17:00.000Z	flexgrip	snugg	anything in synaptic that can handle all of that?
2007-12-30T11:18:00.000Z	snugg	flexgrip	the dhcp server is perhaps, the other two is handled by iptables thats already in ubuntu
2007-12-30T11:21:00.000Z	snugg	flexgrip	as root ennable port forwarding by   echo 1> /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
