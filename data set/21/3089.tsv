2011-05-12T22:02:00.000Z	BluesKaj		yeah jacobt vmware and VMs in general are ok ,but th cause more probs than I'm wiling to put up with , so usually I just dual boot . or run linux exclusively , but hat depends on your situation of course
2011-05-12T22:04:00.000Z	BluesKaj	jacobt	guided partitioning is best , and pay attn to what the options are , thn you should be fine
