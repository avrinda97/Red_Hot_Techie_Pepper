2009-06-06T23:25:00.000Z	lennyf	smooth	for me fluxbox is easier to configure than openbox.
2009-06-06T23:26:00.000Z	lennyf	smooth	crunchbang is a fully configured distro.
2009-06-06T23:26:00.000Z	smooth	lennyf	I'm in flux right now and it's great! Really fast - easy enough to change desktop colors etc. ?
2009-06-06T23:27:00.000Z	lennyf	smooth	i'm still learning myself.
2009-06-06T23:28:00.000Z	smooth	lennyf	archlight  Well I have an extra HD or two laying around - might give it a try - would it be anything similar or close to arch ?
2009-06-06T23:29:00.000Z	lennyf	smooth	it will be ubuntu with a light wm.
2009-06-06T23:29:00.000Z	smooth	lennyf	Not a big fan of compiz, etc - Just want my computer to run fast and be reliable.
2009-06-06T23:29:00.000Z	lennyf	smooth	just log out and change your sesson to fluxbox.
2009-06-06T23:30:00.000Z	smooth	lennyf	I'm in fluxbox desktop now...
2009-06-06T23:30:00.000Z	lennyf	smooth	my pc is 800Mhz PIII, and fast with fluxbox.  only 100MB ram used.
2009-06-06T23:31:00.000Z	smooth	lennyf	I just installed the other sessions to show friends or anyone that might interested in installing Linux.
2009-06-06T23:34:00.000Z	smooth	lennyf	Been looking for version of ubuntu to install on some old computers with mostly intel chipset but want them to user friendly enough to sell - thinking about xubuntu - what do think - right choice ?
2009-06-06T23:35:00.000Z	lennyf	smooth	probably ok, easy to configure like windows.  takes 100-150MB ram.
2009-06-06T23:36:00.000Z	smooth	lennyf	yea - my choice would be flux - but market I will be advertising in is 99% windows people.
