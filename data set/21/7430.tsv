2007-02-06T07:38:00.000Z	kingace		i get that error ^
2007-02-06T07:38:00.000Z	kingace		but those two apps are currently latest version
2007-02-06T07:40:00.000Z	ardchoille	kingace	Are you on Dapper? Edgy?
2007-02-06T07:40:00.000Z	kingace	ardchoille	technically im on dapper, but all my software i up-to-date
2007-02-06T07:41:00.000Z	ardchoille	kingace	And are you trying to install something from Edgy repos or a debian .deb package?
2007-02-06T07:41:00.000Z	kingace	ardchoille	edgy/dapper repos
2007-02-06T07:41:00.000Z	ardchoille	kingace	So you're mixing repos? That's not a good idea IMHO
2007-02-06T07:41:00.000Z	kingace	ardchoille	ight, lemme fix that
2007-02-06T07:42:00.000Z	ardchoille	kingace	Kinda looks like you're having a conflict due to mixing versions.
2007-02-06T07:43:00.000Z	kingace	ardchoille	mixing versions of what? libc6? or dapper vs. edgy?
2007-02-06T07:43:00.000Z	ardchoille	kingace	Mixing dapper/edgy stuff will cause a mixing of app versions and is not recommended.
2007-02-06T07:44:00.000Z	kingace	ardchoille	ok, im gonna fix real quick, and then we'll see if it works, and i'll be back
2007-02-06T07:44:00.000Z	kingace	ardchoille	thanks so far
2007-02-06T07:44:00.000Z	ardchoille	kingace	Which is the reason for the conflict you posted ;)
2007-02-06T07:46:00.000Z	kingace	ardchoille	ok, when i switched everything to edgy, dist-upgrade gives me about 1500 mb worth of packages to upgrade.. this normal?
2007-02-06T07:46:00.000Z	ardchoille	kingace	If you're upgrading from Dapper to Edgy, I believe that would be normal as all of your stuff needs to be upgraded to the versions used in Edgy.
2007-02-06T07:47:00.000Z	kingace	ardchoille	i guess ill just upgrade then.. wish me luck
2007-02-06T07:47:00.000Z	ardchoille	kingace	Good luck!
