2006-09-25T16:43:00.000Z	Janchi		Orbin: the Indigo comes with 500 Mhz clockspeed and 768 MB RAM. I will give Xubuntu a try then. Ubuntu was frozen solid ;-)
2006-09-25T16:43:00.000Z	mneptok	Janchi	that's more than enough for Ubuntu
2006-09-25T16:43:00.000Z	mneptok	Janchi	i've had Ubuntu running well on a toilet-seat iBook@366Mhz.
2006-09-25T16:44:00.000Z	mneptok	Janchi	how much swap did you allow for? what apps did you install?
2006-09-25T16:44:00.000Z	mneptok	Janchi	the most recent Ubuntu shouyld be faster than the most recent OSX by a wide margin
2006-09-25T16:45:00.000Z	mneptok	Janchi	if it won't boot from CD, maybe there are hardware issues?
2006-09-25T16:47:00.000Z	mneptok	Janchi	smells like a bad burn or bad hardware
2006-09-25T16:49:00.000Z	Janchi	mneptok	I heard the issue about the burn speed before for the iMac. Why is that? (just wanting to learn)
2006-09-25T16:50:00.000Z	mneptok	Janchi	the CDs are not very fault tolerant. a single 1 instead of a 0 can be fatal. but that is rarely the case for, say, a movie file.
2006-09-25T16:51:00.000Z	Janchi	mneptok	true. i will burn a new live CD image this way.
2006-10-02T14:56:00.000Z	mneptok	Janchi	Ubuntu ships with the xorg X11, not xfree
2006-10-02T15:06:00.000Z	Janchi	mneptok	exactly. On the iMac xorg freezes. I found that out while installing Debian Sarge. Sarge still uses xfree, but when upgrading to Sid it froze like Ubuntu. xserver-xorg seems to be the culprit
2006-10-02T15:07:00.000Z	mneptok	Janchi	are these clean installs, or aer you trying to overwite one X11 implementation with another and expecting no problems? ;)
2006-10-02T15:10:00.000Z	Janchi	mneptok	Ubuntu Dapper on the iMac was a clean install. Sarge was a clean install, from Sarge to Sid was an upgrade
2006-10-02T15:18:00.000Z	Janchi	mneptok	one of the solutions that was suggested was not to use the FBDev option. I was curious whether someone had experience with it.
2006-10-02T15:19:00.000Z	mneptok	Janchi	the solution is to abandon the deprecated XFree86 for X.org ;)
2006-10-02T15:22:00.000Z	Janchi	mneptok	sorry but that is exactly what is causing the problem on the iMac. X.org is freezing, not xfree86
2006-10-02T15:23:00.000Z	mneptok	Janchi	probably because you have old bits of XFree lying around
2006-10-02T15:25:00.000Z	Janchi	mneptok	how is that possible with a clean install of Dapper?
2006-10-02T15:26:00.000Z	mneptok	Janchi	it is possible because you probably did not reformat the partition on which Linux lives.
2006-10-02T15:29:00.000Z	mneptok	Janchi	x.org works perfectly well on PPC. i have installed it countless times on Apple hardware. x.org itself is not the problem.
