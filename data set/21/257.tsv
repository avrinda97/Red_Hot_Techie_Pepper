2012-04-28T10:10:00.000Z	eco2geek	pratz	- in my experience, reformatting the usb stick, making sure the boot flag is set to "on" when you reformat it, sometimes helps
2012-04-28T10:10:00.000Z	eco2geek	pratz	- of course that'll destroy all data currently on the usb stick
2012-04-28T10:11:00.000Z	pratz	eco2geek	where is the boot flag in usb , is it a file or ??
2012-04-28T10:12:00.000Z	eco2geek	pratz	- no, run gparted. this is the method i use (which again destroys all data on the usb stick so back it up if there's anything on there you want to keep)
2012-04-28T10:13:00.000Z	pratz	eco2geek	i just opened it with "Disk Utility" and it says partion flag is bootable
2012-04-28T10:13:00.000Z	pratz	eco2geek	file type should be FAT , correct ??
2012-04-28T10:13:00.000Z	eco2geek	pratz	- ok good, yes fat16
2012-04-28T10:15:00.000Z	eco2geek	pratz	- like Fyodorovna said, or try running Ubuntu's usb creator again - some computers simply won't boot from usb
2012-04-28T10:20:00.000Z	pratz	eco2geek	i am going to try again lets see this time
2012-04-28T10:20:00.000Z	pratz	eco2geek	so first i need to exit from freenode
2012-04-28T10:29:00.000Z	pratz	eco2geek	tried once again reformatting usb disk but it does not seems to be detected at the boot time
2012-04-28T10:29:00.000Z	pratz	eco2geek	any thing else you would like to suggest ???
2012-04-28T10:30:00.000Z	pratz	eco2geek	any other disk creator ??
2012-04-28T10:32:00.000Z	pratz	eco2geek	dude any more suggestion ??
2012-04-28T10:55:00.000Z	pratz	eco2geek	dude tried with nusbbootin still the same, usb is not recognized at boot
2012-04-28T10:55:00.000Z	pratz	eco2geek	any more suggestions
2012-04-28T10:59:00.000Z	eco2geek	pratz	- do you have a usb key that you _can_ boot from? one that has another distro on it?
2012-04-28T11:00:00.000Z	pratz	eco2geek	no, but will get from my friend and try again
2012-04-28T11:00:00.000Z	pratz	eco2geek	you think the usb stick is not good ??
2012-04-28T11:02:00.000Z	eco2geek	pratz	- as an obsessive type myself i would crank up gparted, create a new partition table, create a new partition, format with fat16, make sure the boot flag was set, and try again :-)
2012-04-28T11:04:00.000Z	eco2geek	pratz	- but then that might not even work, no guarantees - it depends on how much time you want to spend dinking with it
