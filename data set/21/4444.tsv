2009-11-15T14:00:00.000Z	soreau	andresmh	Check the settings in ccsm>General Options>Focus and Raise Behavior
2009-11-15T14:01:00.000Z	soreau	andresmh	You might need to set the focus prevention level differently there
2009-11-15T14:03:00.000Z	andresmh	soreau	thanks! i did try setting it to "High" but it keeps doing the same: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/285483/tmp/screenshot90.png
2009-11-15T14:03:00.000Z	soreau	andresmh	If that doesnt work, you can try setting a rule in ccsm>Window Rules
2009-11-15T14:06:00.000Z	andresmh	soreau	thanks, I tried this http://dl.dropbox.com/u/285483/tmp/screenshot91.png but now I cannot see the IM window by clicking on it on the gnome panel, i have to minize all the other open windows
2009-11-15T14:06:00.000Z	soreau	andresmh	I thought that was what you were trying to do
2009-11-15T14:09:00.000Z	andresmh	soreau	I want it not to popup automatically, but I don't want to have to minimize every single window in order to see the new IM. FOr example, when I click on a Gedit icon on the gnome menu it opens up, i don't have to minize every winow to see it. I hope I explaining well.
2009-11-15T14:10:00.000Z	soreau	andresmh	No I dont understand, sorry
2009-11-15T14:13:00.000Z	andresmh	soreau	you know how the GNOME panel has a list of the windows, right? When you click on one of those on the panel the window will become active, right? Well, this behavior is disabled if I set "below" for Pidgin class on CCSM. I don't want that. All I want is for it not to gain focus and pop up on top when a new message arrives.
2009-11-15T14:15:00.000Z	soreau	andresmh	In the focus and raise behavior settings, set the match you have for focus prevention windows
2009-11-15T14:17:00.000Z	andresmh	soreau	I tired that: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/285483/tmp/screenshot92.png
2009-11-15T14:17:00.000Z	andresmh	soreau	but the window of a new messages are still poping up on top and gaining focus
2009-11-15T14:19:00.000Z	soreau	andresmh	Well I am out of ideas then, maybe you need the opposite !(class=Pidgen)
2009-11-15T14:21:00.000Z	andresmh	soreau	no, that didn't work either, thanks anyway for spending the time
2009-11-15T14:22:00.000Z	soreau	andresmh	I guess pidgen is overriding WM settings. If it still happens with metacity, file a bug with pidgen. If it does not happen with metacity, bug for compiz
2009-11-15T14:25:00.000Z	andresmh	soreau	yeah, it doesn't happen with metacity. I'm surprised something so annoying hasn't been fixed.
2009-11-15T14:26:00.000Z	soreau	andresmh	I think most people just use xchat ;)
2009-11-15T14:27:00.000Z	andresmh	soreau	really? all that work that went into the new notification system for nothing! :)
2009-11-15T14:27:00.000Z	soreau	andresmh	idk, I dont use pidgen
