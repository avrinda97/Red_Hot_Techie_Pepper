2006-06-13T08:29:00.000Z	chumpalump	uXp	tristanmike just mentioned you can't write to ntfs, only fat32, but the mount command says rw, so.. I'm checkin it out
2006-06-13T08:29:00.000Z	uXp	chumpalump	 ok thx
2006-06-13T08:35:00.000Z	chumpalump	uXp	Yeah, readonly is forced, otherwise you can get file damage :-(
2006-06-13T08:37:00.000Z	chumpalump	uXp	Why do you need writable for movies?
2006-06-13T08:37:00.000Z	uXp	chumpalump	 im triyng ot put the ones i just dl into my external HD
2006-06-13T08:39:00.000Z	chumpalump	uXp	see https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+ticket/364 for discussion.  Can you format the drive at fat32.  Then it's usable by linux and windows.
