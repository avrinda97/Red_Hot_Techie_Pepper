2009-05-29T05:41:00.000Z	mram50		hello folks..is there a way to migrate the data i have on a debian machine to ubuntu on the same machine with a new, clean partition? Doesn't seem like i should be able to do that, but something in the documentation seems to suggest it's possible
2009-05-29T05:42:00.000Z	losher	mram50	it depends on what you mean by 'the data'. Which data exactly?
2009-05-29T05:46:00.000Z	losher	mram50	it's spread over few different places. Bookmarks are generally in /home/<user>. Usernames & passwords in /etc/passwd & /etc/shadow, email accounts - depends on what you've been using. In general, if you back up everything in /etc and /home you'll have it all, but you might have to dig around for what you want. You can just copy /etc from one OS to another....

2009-05-29T05:48:00.000Z	losher	mram50	can -> can't
2009-05-29T05:50:00.000Z	losher	mram50	my understanding is that even with windows, the so-called migration tools have only limited success...
2009-05-29T05:53:00.000Z	losher	mram50	I have it down to something of an art these days: about 17 files from /etc plus everything in /home. The real problem going between OSes is that you can't be sure the file formats will be identical. Going from debian to ubuntu they'll be close, but close doesn't really cut it...
2009-05-29T05:56:00.000Z	losher	mram50	8.04.2 LTS is a very stable, solid release. 9.04 is notorious for flash problems...
2009-05-29T05:58:00.000Z	losher	mram50	I use flashblock. Almost all flash is disposable I find & inversely proportional to usable info...
2009-05-29T05:59:00.000Z	losher	mram50	no guarantees of course, but give 8.04.2 a whirl...
2009-05-29T06:00:00.000Z	losher	mram50	9.04 is notorious for flash problems, 8.04.2 seems fine...
2009-05-29T06:03:00.000Z	losher	mram50	9.04 still seems to need a lot of tinkering. Save yourself some grief and start with 8.04.2
2009-05-29T06:05:00.000Z	losher	mram50	yes, same process as 9.04. Download, burn, run live, install...
2009-05-29T06:06:00.000Z	losher	mram50	it's pretty foolproof in Ubuntu... :-)
2009-05-29T06:08:00.000Z	losher	mram50	osh, losh, losher. Whatever. If your burner dies, there's a workaround, http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/ . Warning, I've never actually tried this myself...
2009-05-29T06:10:00.000Z	losher	mram50	Burners fail eventually, Given the precision required for burning, it's a wonder they last as long as they do. If you use unetbootin, come back & let us know how it went
2009-05-29T06:12:00.000Z	losher	mram50	there's an option to download an iso and boot directly from it, as I understand...
2009-05-29T06:16:00.000Z	losher	mram50	they're dirt cheap. $23 from newegg when on sale...
2009-05-29T06:17:00.000Z	losher	mram50	very cool, but off topic :-)
2009-05-29T06:21:00.000Z	losher	mram50	best of luck...
2009-05-29T06:22:00.000Z	losher	mram50	if unetbootin works, you shoudl be able to just fine...
