2011-07-06T21:55:00.000Z	Maestro		I'm having issues with my laptop, it won't recognize when a cable is connected to the ethernet adapter
2011-07-06T21:57:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Maestro	did you connect before booting in ?
2011-07-06T21:57:00.000Z	Maestro	BluesKaj	I've done several reboots with the cable still connected
2011-07-06T21:59:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Maestro	 ifconfig in the terminal , then sudo dhclient eth0
2011-07-06T22:01:00.000Z	Maestro	BluesKaj	didn't work. I believe it might be a hardware issue, since none of the leds on the ethernet port ever flashes
2011-07-06T22:02:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Maestro	what about the network manager , what are your settings ..right click on it
2011-07-06T22:04:00.000Z	Maestro	BluesKaj	right click where?
2011-07-06T22:06:00.000Z	Maestro	BluesKaj	that only gives me a context menu with About, Remove from panel etc.
2011-07-06T22:06:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Maestro	 in the terminal, sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
2011-07-06T22:07:00.000Z	Maestro	BluesKaj	I've tried that one before as well, didn't do anything different this time
2011-07-06T22:09:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Maestro	ok  , alt+F2 , /etc/network/interfaces , what's listed there ?

2011-07-06T22:15:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Maestro	try,  ifup eth0 in the terminal
2011-07-06T22:37:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Maestro	sorry, it should be , sudo ifup eth0
2011-07-06T22:37:00.000Z	Maestro	BluesKaj	yeah, figured
2011-07-06T22:39:00.000Z	Maestro	BluesKaj	what the command said was that eth0 was already configured
2011-07-06T22:42:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Maestro	it's rather odd , ethernet should work, right out if the box , check this file , make sure the enabled states are all  =true , kdesudo kate /var/lib/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.state
2011-07-06T22:43:00.000Z	Maestro	BluesKaj	networking, wireless and WWAN is set to true in that file
2011-07-06T22:44:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Maestro	can it see the gateway /router , route ,  in the terminal ....
2011-07-06T22:46:00.000Z	Maestro	BluesKaj	no, only on the wireless interface can see the router, not eth0
2011-07-06T22:47:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Maestro	do you use a modeswitch on your internet connection ?
