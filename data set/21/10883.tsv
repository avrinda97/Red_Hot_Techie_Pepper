2004-10-26T14:42:00.000Z	pantz	gxwalk	yeah
2004-10-26T14:42:00.000Z	pantz	gxwalk	does it use dhcp to get an ip?
2004-10-26T14:43:00.000Z	pantz	gxwalk	have you tried unplugging your modem for about 1 min then replugging it (power cable i mean)
2004-10-26T14:46:00.000Z	pantz	gxwalk	dhclient ethX
2004-10-26T14:48:00.000Z	pantz	gxwalk	yes :)
2004-10-26T14:50:00.000Z	pantz	gxwalk	do you have the 'dhclient' program?
2004-10-26T14:51:00.000Z	pantz	gxwalk	mmm dunno what the dist-update would do - i am still a bit of a debian newbie myself
2004-10-26T14:54:00.000Z	pantz	gxwalk	and when you boot into suse - everything is fine?
2004-10-26T14:56:00.000Z	pantz	gxwalk	i'm with WW_ - i have upgraded all along and nothing broke either
2004-10-26T14:57:00.000Z	pantz	gxwalk	do you have windows on the same disk as ubuntu?
2004-10-26T14:59:00.000Z	pantz	gxwalk	feel like trying to install suse on that disk just to see if it installs ok?
