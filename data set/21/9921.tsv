2005-07-02T05:11:00.000Z	rift-		not to mention the xorg issues now plaguing a lot of distros
2005-07-02T05:12:00.000Z	rift-		i get complete hangs if I have xorg + fglrx + acpi + apm
2005-07-02T05:13:00.000Z	ys76	rift-	acpi AND apm?
2005-07-02T05:13:00.000Z	rift-		i don't even use acpi or apm, so I don't care
2005-07-02T05:13:00.000Z	rift-	ys76	ya, had to stop both services
2005-07-02T05:14:00.000Z	ys76	rift-	There were some issues when you tried to run both...
2005-07-02T05:14:00.000Z	ys76	rift-	Try to rmmod at least the apm module
2005-07-02T05:14:00.000Z	rift-	ys76	i don't use either, so I just removed both
2005-07-02T05:16:00.000Z	ys76	rift-	Try to complain at ATIs. They receive lots of emails during the last few days. Hope they change their politics a bit
2005-07-02T05:16:00.000Z	rift-		ya I should
2005-07-02T05:16:00.000Z	rift-		i can't believe they would release such a buggy driver
2005-07-02T05:16:00.000Z	rift-		don't they have a Q/A department?
2005-07-02T05:17:00.000Z	ys76	rift-	Yes, they do have one, but it's ATI
