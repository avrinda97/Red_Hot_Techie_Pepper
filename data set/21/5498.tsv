2007-10-01T15:43:00.000Z	Semidios		Okay,  I recently Installed Ubuntu on a Dell I have laying around.  I am trying to use it as a file server for my Mac Laptop.  I have shared the second drive on the Linux box.  And using Connect to server on the Mac I can connect to it, but when I try to copy files over, it says I do not have permissions.  The file will show up in Linux, but be 0 bytes.  Anyone know how to get this working?
2007-10-01T15:43:00.000Z	Semidios		also I am using NFS to do this
2007-10-01T15:45:00.000Z	purity	Semidios	- if you are not bothered about security chmod a+rwx /path_of_shared_nfs_drive
2007-10-01T15:46:00.000Z	purity		electrosys - from nautilus ctrl -H
2007-10-01T15:46:00.000Z	Semidios	purity	permissions on the second drive are set to 777..  or at least the umask in the fstab is set to 000
2007-10-01T15:47:00.000Z	purity		electrosys ls -al /path_of_files
2007-10-01T15:48:00.000Z	purity		electrosys - type at command prompt "ls -al /path_of_files" eg "ls -al /home/electrosys"
2007-10-01T15:49:00.000Z	purity		electrosys - hidden files start with a period eg .profile is a hidden file
2007-10-01T15:55:00.000Z	purity		semidios - type ls -l /path_to_share and see what the permissions are
2007-10-01T16:01:00.000Z	Semidios	purity	drwxrwxrwx 4 root users    16384  2007-19-01 16:41 Media
2007-10-01T16:03:00.000Z	purity		semidios - have you tried copying a single file to the root of this share?
2007-10-01T16:04:00.000Z	Semidios	purity	yes.  It shows up.  but it is 0 bytes.  When I drag it over on the Mac its says "The operation cannot be completed because you do not have sufficient privileges for some of the items."
2007-10-02T16:08:00.000Z	purity		semidios - so if you type in ls -al /path_to_share what information do you get for the file you have tried to copy over?
2007-10-02T16:10:00.000Z	Semidios	purity	-rwxrwxrwx 1 root users    0  2007-10-01  17:08
2007-10-02T16:11:00.000Z	purity		semidios - what happens if you put a file in the share from the linux box and copy it over to the mac, from the mac
2007-10-02T16:14:00.000Z	Semidios	purity	it opens on the mac just fine.  copys over great.
2007-10-02T16:16:00.000Z	purity		<semidios> what have you put in your /etc/exports file?
2007-10-02T16:18:00.000Z	Semidios	purity	/media/Media 192.168.1.1/24 (rw,insecure,no_root_squash,async)
2007-10-02T16:23:00.000Z	purity		semidios try the following command from your mac and try again maybe with a different mount point temporarily  mount -o -P FILESERVERIP:/SHARE /MOUNTPOINT
2007-10-02T16:27:00.000Z	Semidios	purity	i did a mkdir /Media to use as the mount point on my Mac.  then did the command and it gives me "Mount nfs: /Media : Permission denied"       if you could /msg me the next step I would appreciate it.  I have to step away from the comp for a bit..  10min or so
2007-10-02T16:41:00.000Z	Semidios	purity	I reexcuted the command using sudo.  it worked.  I copied the file over and it showed up perfectly.  I think I know what changes I have to make now to get it running.  Thank you.  I'll be in touch if I get stuck
