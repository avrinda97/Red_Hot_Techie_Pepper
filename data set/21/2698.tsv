2009-07-26T17:19:00.000Z	jrib	apoleo12	« swapon -s » was for you, sorry Alien2009
2009-07-26T17:21:00.000Z	apoleo12	jrib	so thats turn on the swap?
2009-07-26T17:21:00.000Z	jrib	apoleo12	no.  That shows you a summary of your swap partitions and their usage.  What do you want to do?
2009-07-26T17:22:00.000Z	apoleo12	jrib	i wanted to turn it on only that i think i see it isnt active according to system monitor
2009-07-26T17:27:00.000Z	jrib	apoleo12	why "should"?  Is it or is it not?
2009-07-26T17:27:00.000Z	jrib	apoleo12	what does « swapon -s » return?
2009-07-26T17:32:00.000Z	jrib	apoleo12	you can install the program "pastebinit" and use it to show us the output
2009-07-26T17:46:00.000Z	jrib	apoleo12	type it out
2009-07-26T17:48:00.000Z	jrib	apoleo12	run « sudo blkid » and update your UUID for your swap partition in fstab
