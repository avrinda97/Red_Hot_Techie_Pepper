2006-04-21T09:30:00.000Z	speedie		after uninstalling a dpkg and trying to reinstall it, it doesn't work right, some stuff doesn't get done
2006-04-21T09:31:00.000Z	speedie		but I found some dkpg info files, could those have something to do with it?
2006-04-21T09:32:00.000Z	speedie		SOB
2006-04-21T09:32:00.000Z	speedie		I need someone's help, please.... I messed up my oracle install, so I tried to uninstall the dpkg
2006-04-21T09:32:00.000Z	speedie		but now it won't reinstall properly, from dpkg
2006-04-21T09:32:00.000Z	speedie		it won't recreate the oracle user, or put the executable in /etc/init.d
2006-04-21T09:33:00.000Z	speedie		how do I get my system back to the way it was pre oracle install, completely, so that the install will work properly again
2006-04-21T09:33:00.000Z	dabaR	speedie	have you tried sudo aptitude -f install?
2006-04-21T09:35:00.000Z	speedie	dabaR	will that remove crap from uninstalled packages?
2006-04-21T09:36:00.000Z	dabaR	speedie	that will repair your package system, if it has breakage in packages. To remove files, you can do that manually.
2006-04-21T09:36:00.000Z	speedie	dabaR	It says no packages installed upgraded or removed
2006-04-21T09:36:00.000Z	speedie	dabaR	I did remove them manually, but now when I try to reinstall, it won't recreate some of the files/etc
2006-04-21T09:37:00.000Z	dabaR	speedie	then you are fine, no broken packages. What exactly would you like?
2006-04-21T09:37:00.000Z	dabaR	speedie	what are you installing?
2006-04-21T09:37:00.000Z	speedie	dabaR	when I run the install program, I would like it to do all of the things it did the first tim
2006-04-21T09:37:00.000Z	speedie	dabaR	oracle xe
2006-04-21T09:37:00.000Z	dabaR	speedie	is that through apt?
2006-04-21T09:37:00.000Z	speedie	dabaR	oracle xe creates a user called oracle, and installs the executable in /etc/init.d and it's not doing those things now
2006-04-21T09:38:00.000Z	speedie	dabaR	dpkg
2006-04-21T09:38:00.000Z	dabaR	speedie	I am not sure. A clue is to read the dpkg manual, to find some option for complete reinstallation.
