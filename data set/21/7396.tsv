2007-02-18T06:10:00.000Z	puff		I haven't dist-upgraded in a while... how dangerous is it?
2007-02-18T06:10:00.000Z	puff		I've had problems in the past, with debian, where dist-upgrading broke all sorts of stuff.  Hence my paranoia.
2007-02-18T06:10:00.000Z	daviey	puff	the cascades are good at the moment; i'd recommend either using udate manager or aptitude though
2007-02-18T06:11:00.000Z	puff	daviey	Okay.  Why?
2007-02-18T06:12:00.000Z	puff	daviey	I tend to use aptitude.  dabaR said to use update-manager.
2007-02-18T06:13:00.000Z	daviey	puff	apt-get will leave dist-upgrade stuff behind and doesn't satisfy dependecies as well as aptitude.
2007-02-18T06:14:00.000Z	puff	daviey	Really?  And here I thought aptitude was just a nicer interface.
2007-02-18T06:14:00.000Z	daviey	puff	and for what it's worth, aptitude will also autoclean automatically
2007-02-18T06:15:00.000Z	puff	daviey	I still want somebody (or eventually I do it myself) to hack some comment stuff into apttiude.  I'd like to be able to make a note as to why I installed something, and have it automatically note when it installs it as a dependency.
2007-02-18T06:15:00.000Z	puff	daviey	What's your estimate of riskiness of dist-upgrading?
2007-02-18T06:17:00.000Z	daviey	puff	do you want to upgrade from dapper to edgy?
2007-02-18T06:17:00.000Z	puff	daviey	I suspect I do, is edgy stable now?
2007-02-18T06:18:00.000Z	daviey	puff	well stable
2007-02-18T06:18:00.000Z	puff	daviey	Mainly I want to be up to date and stable, etc.  I ended up stalling for quite a while before upgrading to dapper.  I still have burn marks from debian upgrade problems in the past, so I'm gunshy :-).
2007-02-18T06:19:00.000Z	daviey	puff	see the upgrade link from ubuntu.  It's safe, thousands of people have done it
2007-02-18T06:20:00.000Z	puff	daviey	Hm, okay, guess I should upgrade, then.
2007-02-18T06:21:00.000Z	daviey	puff	your brave ;)  You'll be fine
2007-02-18T06:38:00.000Z	daviey	puff	tripppy ; we are starting to float off topic
2007-02-18T06:39:00.000Z	puff	daviey	Yeah, thanks.  I'll stop my ranting now :-).
2007-02-18T06:39:00.000Z	puff	daviey	It would be nice for there to be a definitive ubuntu-based dedicated firewall spinoff, though.
2007-02-18T06:53:00.000Z	daviey	puff	sorry for the delay; i agree.  I considered forking ipcop to work with ubuntu server
