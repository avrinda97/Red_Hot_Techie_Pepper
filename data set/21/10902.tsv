2005-02-24T09:31:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ubuntu2u	 yeah
2005-02-24T09:32:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ubuntu2u	 you don't need ad-aware or whatever it is
2005-02-24T09:32:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ubuntu2u	 as for merc I don't know what that is
2005-02-24T09:33:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ubuntu2u	wht games do you want to play ?
2005-02-24T09:34:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ubuntu2u	you can't run any windows applications on Linux easily
2005-02-24T09:39:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ubuntu2u	programs that run on Microsoft products (like Windows 95, 98 2000, XP) will not run in Linux.
2005-02-24T09:45:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ubuntu2u	tell us what kind of programs you want to run we can tell you what "Linux Versions" or Windows programs to install if they exist :)
2005-02-24T09:54:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ubuntu2u	no, to run Microsoft programs you need software and permission from Microsoft which they won't give to the Open Source Community
2005-02-24T09:57:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ubuntu2u	it depends on the company that makes the games.
2005-02-24T10:00:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ubuntu2u	I don't know but the Quake and Unreal Tournament series of games seem to work well
2005-02-24T10:04:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ubuntu2u	no, I jsut like to help out :)
2005-02-24T10:05:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ubuntu2u	your name is in it :D
2005-02-27T09:59:00.000Z	LinuxJones	ubuntu2u	don't use telnet search google for "ssh tutorial"
