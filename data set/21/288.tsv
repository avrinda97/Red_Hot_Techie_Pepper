2012-03-26T17:33:00.000Z	Shadow_f		hey, I am looking for some help. I can't seem to instal ubuntu right and every time I do I get a permissions error. can anyone help? thanks.
2012-03-26T17:33:00.000Z	_Marcus	Shadow_f	How are you installing it?
2012-03-26T17:34:00.000Z	_Marcus	Shadow_f	Installer CD?
2012-03-26T17:34:00.000Z	_Marcus	Shadow_f	At what part are you getting these errors?
2012-03-26T17:35:00.000Z	_Marcus	Shadow_f	So are you still in Windows?
2012-03-26T17:36:00.000Z	_Marcus	Shadow_f	Can you take a screenshot and upload it somewhere for us to see?
2012-03-26T17:38:00.000Z	_Marcus	Shadow_f	Can you pastebin the log please?
2012-03-26T17:42:00.000Z	Shadow_f	_Marcus	do you know whats wrong?
2012-03-26T17:42:00.000Z	_Marcus	Shadow_f	Since yiou are running Windows 7, try running it as Administrator
2012-03-26T17:43:00.000Z	_Marcus	Shadow_f	No problem, I don't know if this will fix it though.
2012-03-26T17:44:00.000Z	Shadow_f	_Marcus	ok, well if it doesn't then I might have to check youtube or something.
2012-03-26T17:44:00.000Z	_Marcus	Shadow_f	It's either not able to put files there because it needs to be run as admin, or a file is in use.
2012-03-26T17:45:00.000Z	Shadow_f	_Marcus	ok, it might be the file is in use. that happens a lot to me
2012-03-26T17:45:00.000Z	_Marcus	Shadow_f	If that is the case, try restarting the computer. I know it sounds dumb and you probally did that already, but it could help.
2012-03-26T17:45:00.000Z	Shadow_f	_Marcus	yeah I did that before, but that would help :P
2012-03-26T17:46:00.000Z	Shadow_f	_Marcus	the error poped up again lol
2012-03-26T17:47:00.000Z	Shadow_f	_Marcus	what file would it be using?
2012-03-26T17:47:00.000Z	_Marcus	Shadow_f	I don't know
2012-03-26T17:47:00.000Z	Shadow_f	_Marcus	ok, thanks for helping though.
2012-03-26T17:48:00.000Z	_Marcus	Shadow_f	No problem, ask again in the channel, someone else may be able to help
2012-03-26T17:48:00.000Z	Shadow_f	_Marcus	Ok, I have to leave in 12 minutes so idk if I had time.
