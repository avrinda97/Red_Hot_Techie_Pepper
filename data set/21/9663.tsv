2005-08-07T11:50:00.000Z	Seveas		it's not impossible, it might just be hard :)
2005-08-07T11:50:00.000Z	Seveas		sarge -> hoary is not the easiest route
2005-08-07T11:51:00.000Z	Seveas		sarge -> breezy or woody -> hoary are easier
2005-08-07T11:51:00.000Z	cefx	Seveas	Hi!  Nice to meet you. :) I'm a new user...and I think I've converted from Slackware -> Ubuntu...
2005-08-07T11:58:00.000Z	cefx	Seveas	if he uses nameservers he can set his hostname to whatever he wants.
2005-08-07T11:58:00.000Z	Seveas	cefx	IRC servers cannot know that domain
2005-08-07T11:59:00.000Z	cefx	Seveas	they don't have to.  That's what nameservers are for.
2005-08-07T11:59:00.000Z	Seveas	cefx	that's not what we are talking about
2005-08-07T12:00:00.000Z	Seveas	cefx	do NOT advise that
2005-08-07T12:01:00.000Z	Seveas	cefx	the UBuntu way is to use sudo, so explaining sudo is preferred over explaing sudo passwd root :)
2005-08-07T12:36:00.000Z	cefx	Seveas	What would I do to upgrade to -current?
2005-08-07T12:36:00.000Z	Seveas	cefx	what do you mean>
2005-08-07T12:36:00.000Z	cefx	Seveas	Kernel upgrade
2005-08-07T12:41:00.000Z	cefx	Seveas	What's the difference of vi vs vim?
2005-08-07T12:41:00.000Z	Seveas	cefx	on ubuntu vi is a symlink to vim
2005-08-07T12:45:00.000Z	cefx	Seveas	that's bad though, -anyone- could fuck with him
2005-08-08T16:32:00.000Z	cefx	Seveas	what's the "ubuntu" way of editing Xorg.conf?
2005-08-11T10:42:00.000Z	cefx	Seveas	anything in that line look wrong to you?
2005-08-11T10:42:00.000Z	Seveas	cefx	I'm not a burning-kind-of-guy :)
2005-08-11T11:01:00.000Z	Seveas	cefx	lsof `readlink -f /dev/cdrom`
2005-08-11T11:03:00.000Z	cefx	Seveas	that did nothing.
