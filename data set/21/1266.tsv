2010-11-24T10:58:00.000Z	ubuXubu	Jacenzzz	on an asus the recovery partition is accessed by turning on the computer and tapping the f9 key over and over
2010-11-24T10:59:00.000Z	ubuXubu	Jacenzzz	then u will see it boot to recovery..do not choose restore choose recovery.
2010-11-24T11:00:00.000Z	Jacenzzz	ubuXubu	F9 didnt do anything
2010-11-24T11:00:00.000Z	ubuXubu	Jacenzzz	try it again from the off position

2010-11-24T11:12:00.000Z	Jacenzzz	ubuXubu	I dunno either...mean and Ubuntu always end up having fights like these. first time my GRUB was ever screwed up though
2010-11-24T11:13:00.000Z	Jacenzzz	ubuXubu	I was completely repaired to do that. I do frequent backups just in case ;)
