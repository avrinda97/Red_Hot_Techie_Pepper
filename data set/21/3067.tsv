2011-06-15T09:21:00.000Z	josephoenix		On an unrelated note, anyone know if I can ignore just join/part lines in a channel with irssi?
2011-06-15T09:21:00.000Z	celthunder	josephoenix	yeah you can
2011-06-15T09:22:00.000Z	celthunder	josephoenix	google ofr it to find the exact command i just started using weechat instead...has a smartfilter i like better
2011-06-15T09:22:00.000Z	celthunder	josephoenix	don't remember
2011-06-15T10:21:00.000Z	celthunder	josephoenix	what's wrong with that?
2011-06-15T10:22:00.000Z	josephoenix	celthunder	no .profile, groups aren't set right
2011-06-15T10:22:00.000Z	celthunder	josephoenix	i've mad euser accounts by editting /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow and /etc/group
2011-06-15T10:22:00.000Z	celthunder	josephoenix	cp /etc/skel /home/<usershome>
2011-06-15T10:23:00.000Z	josephoenix	celthunder	well, he didn't do that.. and my home directory was world-readable..
2011-06-15T10:23:00.000Z	josephoenix	celthunder	point of the story is that, while that is possible, it is not recommended, because most people do it wrong
2011-06-15T10:23:00.000Z	celthunder	josephoenix	lol chmod it
2011-06-15T10:23:00.000Z	celthunder	josephoenix	most people are idiots..we knew that to begin with...including you and me most likely
2011-06-15T10:25:00.000Z	josephoenix	celthunder	which is why most people should use adduser most of the time... :D
2011-06-15T10:26:00.000Z	celthunder	josephoenix	i'd rather use useradd than adduser 9/10 times
2011-06-15T10:27:00.000Z	celthunder	josephoenix	but that's more a personal preference than any real reasoning
2011-06-15T10:31:00.000Z	josephoenix	celthunder	since you seem better versed in this than I am, what would you use to add an admin user to an ubuntu server?
2011-06-15T10:31:00.000Z	celthunder	josephoenix	use wheel
2011-06-15T10:32:00.000Z	josephoenix	celthunder	that's a util? I thought it was a group name, and ubuntu seems to use 'admin' instead
2011-06-15T10:33:00.000Z	celthunder	josephoenix	wheel is a group yes and a user account it's disabled by default but it's pretty much the alternate of a root account
2011-06-15T10:34:00.000Z	celthunder	josephoenix	there is really only ONE admin account...and that's root...you can make another root username just make the uid 0 but...i wouldn't do that
2011-06-15T10:35:00.000Z	celthunder	josephoenix	wheel is the next best to root which is the only REAL admin account.....beyond that...explain more what you're user is going to be doing
