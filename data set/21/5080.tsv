2008-01-06T07:50:00.000Z	matholum		hello everyone.... can someone tell how programming works in ubuntu... java would work ofcourse but in school they stick to .net and c#....
2008-01-06T07:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	matholum	 pick a langage,, install it.. start programing.
2008-01-06T07:51:00.000Z	matholum	Dr_Willis	it just seems so different... being that it isn't .exe and all
2008-01-06T07:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	matholum	 'mono' is the gpl equilivent to .net i hear.. but ive never used it.
2008-01-06T07:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	matholum	 a file extension is trivial.
2008-01-06T07:51:00.000Z	matholum	Dr_Willis	i've heard of mono but i thought it was still vert experimental
2008-01-06T07:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	matholum	 i dont mess with mono. and i avoide .net like the plague :)
2008-01-06T07:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	matholum	 all i do -  i can do with perl and bash.
2008-01-06T07:52:00.000Z	matholum	Dr_Willis	now that i have started using ubuntu i try to too
2008-01-06T07:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	matholum	 perl is avail for windows also. :)
2008-01-06T07:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	matholum	 but it depends on what you are doing. as what program  langiage to use.
2008-01-06T07:54:00.000Z	matholum	Dr_Willis	I have been told just to use java for absolutely everything since that works in everything... but i dunno
2008-01-06T07:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	matholum	 it would be silly to use java - if the task could be done in a 3 line perl script. :)
2008-01-06T07:55:00.000Z	matholum	Dr_Willis	lol... very true...
2008-01-06T07:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	matholum	 but perl is a darn handy tool to know about.  others prefer python, or others.
2008-01-06T07:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	matholum	 thats the joy of linux - all these tools are just an apt-get install away.
2008-01-06T07:56:00.000Z	matholum	Dr_Willis	true.... i love that ^_^
2008-01-06T07:57:00.000Z	matholum	Dr_Willis	I have thought about learning perl before... it would be a good thing to know
2008-01-06T07:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	matholum	 learning perl is good.. learning/mastering 'regular Expressions '  is a MUST. :)
2008-01-06T07:58:00.000Z	matholum	Dr_Willis	well then i am set then... i have used those in javascript and c# ^_^
2008-01-06T07:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	matholum	 then learning perl should be trivial :P
