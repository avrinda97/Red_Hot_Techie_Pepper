2005-12-13T16:07:00.000Z	Jowi	soundray	ouch, ok ok
2006-03-11T13:21:00.000Z	soundray	Jowi	yes.
2006-11-28T15:10:00.000Z	soundray	Jowi	don't confuse this now please
2007-01-30T09:19:00.000Z	soundray	Jowi	it won't work if any of the uncompressed files exceed the limit you set with -n
2007-01-30T09:19:00.000Z	Jowi	soundray	true
2007-09-29T10:32:00.000Z	soundray	Jowi	I can't find that in the man pages -- can you elaborate?
2007-09-29T10:33:00.000Z	Jowi	soundray	you can also set MinSpeed + MaxSpeed in xorg.conf InputDevice section... the darnest thing, I can't find the reference for it on x.org's homepage. only google pages...

2007-09-29T10:34:00.000Z	soundray	Jowi	I think I found something: www.xfree86.og/4.2.0/mouse.4.html -- thanks, I'll try that
2007-09-29T10:35:00.000Z	soundray	Jowi	I assume it won't be much different for xorg
2007-09-29T10:35:00.000Z	Jowi	soundray	I suppose. the worst thing that will happen is that you get an error.
2007-09-29T10:36:00.000Z	Jowi	soundray	at least "resolution" exist http://www.x.org/archive/X11R6.8.2/doc/mouse5.html#24
2007-09-29T10:42:00.000Z	soundray	Jowi	thanks for your input. It seems that my setup doesn't support the resolution option (running ubuntu in vmware)
2007-09-29T10:43:00.000Z	Jowi	soundray	ah, sorry to hear that.
2008-04-03T23:49:00.000Z	Jowi	soundray	I think the !info is broken (at least it was yesterday)
2008-04-03T23:50:00.000Z	soundray	Jowi	thanks -- stefan__: look into smartmontools -- it contains tools to read a drives error status as well as load testing utils.
2008-09-25T23:57:00.000Z	soundray	Jowi	I think this is something only Google can fix (I find it most annoying myself)
2008-09-25T23:58:00.000Z	Jowi	soundray	it's a firefox3 thing. i'm sure of it. it looks up the info somewhere - i just have to find out where so i can adjust it to my liking :)
2008-09-25T23:59:00.000Z	soundray	Jowi	if you're sure... :)  have you looked in about:config?
2008-09-26T00:08:00.000Z	soundray	Jowi	wow
2008-09-26T00:08:00.000Z	Jowi	soundray	yeah :-/
