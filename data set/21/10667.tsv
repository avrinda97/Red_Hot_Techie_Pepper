2005-08-22T15:56:00.000Z	titanium		does anyone know how to set the document root in apache2? i tried editing apache2.conf and setting DocumentRoot but it doesn't do anything
2005-08-22T15:56:00.000Z	pestilence	titanium	did you restart apache?
2005-08-22T15:56:00.000Z	titanium	pestilence	yep. im used to running it on windows so i'm familiar with it
2005-08-22T15:56:00.000Z	pestilence	titanium	(or apache2, even ;)
2005-08-22T15:57:00.000Z	pestilence	titanium	how about editing what's in sites-enabled?
2005-08-22T15:57:00.000Z	titanium	pestilence	you just lost me
2005-08-22T15:57:00.000Z	pestilence	titanium	/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default
2005-08-23T16:01:00.000Z	titanium	pestilence	hooray, that worked. thanks
2005-08-23T16:01:00.000Z	pestilence	titanium	good.
2005-08-23T16:01:00.000Z	pestilence	titanium	now, can you fix *my* apache problem :)
2005-08-23T16:02:00.000Z	titanium	pestilence	not likely i installed linux for the first time three days ago :O
2005-08-23T16:03:00.000Z	pestilence	titanium	hehe :)
2005-08-23T16:07:00.000Z	pestilence	titanium	i would just install it in /usr/lib/java, then setup symlinks in /usr/local/bin to anything you want
2005-08-23T16:07:00.000Z	titanium	pestilence	what do you mean by 'install it'? just move the entire folder there?
2005-08-23T16:07:00.000Z	pestilence	titanium	yup
2005-08-23T16:08:00.000Z	pestilence	titanium	mkdir /usr/lib/java && mv jre-whatever /usr/lib/java
2005-08-23T16:11:00.000Z	titanium	pestilence	well it's the JDK not the jre. it has a bunch of different folders inside the main folder (bin, demo, include, lib, man, jre).  for example i can't type 'man javac' and i can't use javac from any location. it's like it isn't installed properly
2005-08-23T16:12:00.000Z	pestilence	titanium	very true. you will have to do some stuff to get it "installed properly"
2005-08-23T16:12:00.000Z	pestilence	titanium	follow ubotu's instructions
2005-08-23T16:12:00.000Z	pestilence	titanium	it should work for the jdk too
2005-08-23T16:13:00.000Z	titanium	pestilence	i tried the wiki guide, it says to convert the .bin into a .deb but i tried that and it fails horribly. it says in the wiki "you may get this error, do this to fix it". i get the error and doing what it says to fix it didn't fix it. :P
