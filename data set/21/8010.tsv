2006-11-06T17:31:00.000Z	Administrator__	chuckyp	kind a like yes
2006-11-06T17:31:00.000Z	chuckyp	Administrator__	or do you want ot customize a ubuntu live cd?
2006-11-06T17:31:00.000Z	Administrator__	chuckyp	I have read about uck, but it's not advanced enough.
2006-11-06T17:32:00.000Z	chuckyp	Administrator__	well there are many ways to customize the live cd.
2006-11-06T17:32:00.000Z	Administrator__	chuckyp	basicly, if it would be possible I would just like to modify init scripts of a ubuntu install cd
2006-11-06T17:33:00.000Z	chuckyp	Administrator__	let me find you some links
2006-11-06T17:33:00.000Z	Administrator__	chuckyp	the init script is going to be a recovery, so restoring partition table, restoring mbr, mkfs, nount, restore big tarball(backup). fix grub(mbr) if nesseary, and reboot.
2006-11-06T17:34:00.000Z	Administrator__	chuckyp	so if the whole building own recovery cd could be avoided, then, that would be great.
2006-11-06T17:34:00.000Z	Administrator__	chuckyp	I already tried mkcdrec and mondo. But both are buggy.
2006-11-06T17:35:00.000Z	chuckyp	Administrator__	have you seen uck?
2006-11-06T17:35:00.000Z	chuckyp	Administrator__	http://uck.sourceforge.net/?DokuWiki=77b729c5d4708904a8ee681bb6fc2c7f
2006-11-06T17:35:00.000Z	Administrator__	chuckyp	yes, but it's not advanced enough, and, for example, gnome /kde (X) is not needed.
