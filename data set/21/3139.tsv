2009-04-07T09:42:00.000Z	ndshacker		um... its his download im worried aout

2009-04-07T09:42:00.000Z	ndshacker		unless upload matters to?
2009-04-07T09:43:00.000Z	ndshacker		because we only have 100 upload
2009-04-07T09:43:00.000Z	ndshacker		and considering its an isp, that means like 80
2009-04-07T09:44:00.000Z	ndshacker		im gonna kill his torrents when he goes to sleep >.<
2009-04-07T09:44:00.000Z	clearscreen	ndshacker	usually connectivity problems arise when the full capacity of upload speed is being utilized
2009-04-07T09:45:00.000Z	ndshacker	clearscreen	so i can just sneak in and apply a upload limit?
2009-04-07T09:45:00.000Z	ndshacker		and hell never knw since im the one who showed him how to do it
2009-04-07T09:45:00.000Z	clearscreen	ndshacker	I would discuss it with your father, but yes, that would likely solve your problem
