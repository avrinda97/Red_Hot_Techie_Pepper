2008-11-13T21:56:00.000Z	Omar87		Does the "Raising Skinny Elephants Is Utterly Boring" trick still work in Ubuntu 8.10?
2008-11-13T21:57:00.000Z	dromer	Omar87	it should :P
2008-11-13T21:58:00.000Z	Omar87	dromer	because I tried to use it a couple of minutes ago, and it didn't work.. -_-
2008-11-13T21:59:00.000Z	dromer	Omar87	ok, wierd, ctrl+alt+sysrq+b should definatly reboot your system, rseiub is just the best way to siconnect all services and stuff iirc
2008-11-13T22:00:00.000Z	Omar87	dromer	I'm trying it right now, it doesn't work.. That's very weird..
2008-11-13T22:00:00.000Z	dromer	Omar87	I'm not going to try it ;)
2008-11-13T22:00:00.000Z	dromer	Omar87	but it's very oldskool, maybe the kernel-devs removed it
2008-11-13T22:01:00.000Z	Omar87	dromer	Lol, I didn't say you will. :D
2008-11-13T22:02:00.000Z	Omar87	dromer	Yeah, it's an old trick, but sometimes it's your last resort, I mean, sometimes you just need it.
2008-11-13T22:02:00.000Z	dromer	Omar87	yup, strange that it doesn't work for you
2008-11-13T22:02:00.000Z	dromer	Omar87	lemme try it for funs ;) I'm running Kubuntu 8.04 btw
2008-11-13T22:04:00.000Z	Omar87	dromer	I'm trying to play an on-line game called "second life", and this game just keeps strangling my entire system the moment I start controlling my character in it, I try to Raise The Elephants and it just doesn't work..
2008-11-13T22:08:00.000Z	dromer	Omar87	worked btw ;)
2008-11-13T22:15:00.000Z	dromer	Omar87	ctrl+alt+sysrq+<r,s,e,i,u,b>
2008-11-13T22:17:00.000Z	Omar87	dromer	Nope, nothing happens...
2008-11-13T22:18:00.000Z	dromer	Omar87	what system are you running?
2008-11-13T22:19:00.000Z	Omar87	dromer	Ubuntu 8.10
2008-11-13T22:19:00.000Z	dromer	Omar87	ok, I'm on 8.04 .. so things might have changed
2008-11-13T22:19:00.000Z	Omar87	dromer	that's possible.
2008-11-13T22:20:00.000Z	Omar87	dromer	Maybe it still works the same way as before, but with a bit different key combination.
2008-11-13T22:21:00.000Z	Omar87	dromer	mhmm.
