2010-02-15T01:58:00.000Z	diddy		I am having huge problems with USB. Copying stuff from disk to USB stick takes literally hours.
2010-02-15T01:58:00.000Z	diddy		Is there any setting or anything that I could change?
2010-02-15T01:58:00.000Z	diddy		I already updated my BIOS.
2010-02-15T01:59:00.000Z	diddy		1.6 GB. It starts off at 15 MB/s really fast. Copies a few hundreds megs and then goes down to 300KB/s
2010-02-15T01:59:00.000Z	diddy		Now I have to wait for 2 hours to finish according to Nautilus.
2010-02-15T02:00:00.000Z	n00p	diddy	that's just the way USB sticks are
2010-02-15T02:01:00.000Z	n00p	diddy	yes with a brand new, unused drive it may take a couple of minutes... this is because of the way NAND flash works.
2010-02-15T02:01:00.000Z	diddy	n00p	exactly. It is a brand new USB stick. Used it only once.
2010-02-15T02:02:00.000Z	n00p	diddy	how does NAND flash overwrite small amounts of data?
2010-02-15T02:02:00.000Z	diddy	n00p	the stick I am copying to at the moment I only wrote to once, last week.
2010-02-15T02:03:00.000Z	n00p	diddy	once you answer that question, you will know why NAND flash is slow.
2010-02-15T02:03:00.000Z	diddy	n00p	then why was I able to copy at 10 MB in the past from start to end same speed
2010-02-15T02:04:00.000Z	diddy	n00p	and why are the first couple of MB copied at 15 MB and then all of a sudden it goes down to 300 KB/s ?
2010-02-15T02:04:00.000Z	n00p	diddy	this question has the same answer as the one you just asked: how does NAND flash overwrite small amounts of data?
2010-02-15T02:05:00.000Z	n00p	diddy	are you going to attempt to do the research required to answer my question?
2010-02-15T02:05:00.000Z	diddy	n00p	no
2010-02-15T02:07:00.000Z	n00p	diddy	in order for your computer to write 1 byte to a flash cell, there is a certain procedure it must go through
2010-02-15T02:08:00.000Z	diddy	n00p	yes but that procedure it also had to go through in the past and it did it at 15MB/s constant
2010-02-15T02:09:00.000Z	diddy	n00p	the problem is that I am getting tons of read/write errors in demesg and my cpu utilization in top is: Cpu(s):  9.8%us,  1.3%sy,  0.0%ni,  0.0%id, 88.8%wa,  0.2%hi,  0.0%si,  0.0%st
2010-02-15T02:15:00.000Z	diddy	n00p	it seems I am not the only one. I am using the 64 bit version of Ubuntu: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/477843
