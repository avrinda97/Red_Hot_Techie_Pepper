2006-12-03T09:11:00.000Z	aeromix		!ssh
2006-12-03T09:12:00.000Z	aeromix		how am I to start sshd on my computer??
2006-12-03T09:12:00.000Z	jrib	aeromix	just install openssh-server
2006-12-03T09:12:00.000Z	aeromix	jrib	I did. but I can't connect to it now...
2006-12-03T09:13:00.000Z	aeromix	jrib	when I type ssh aeromix@10.0.0.1 I get no response
2006-12-03T09:14:00.000Z	aeromix	jrib	I installed openssh-server. But it seems like it is not enabled?
2006-12-03T09:16:00.000Z	jrib	aeromix	does 'ssh localhost' work?
2006-12-03T09:16:00.000Z	aeromix	jrib	yes
2006-12-03T09:17:00.000Z	jrib	aeromix	then ssh is working.  Maybe you have a firewall?
2006-12-03T09:17:00.000Z	aeromix	jrib	the problem is in the address probably. ping 10.0.0.1 isn't working as well...
2006-12-03T09:17:00.000Z	aeromix	jrib	but internet sharing works, I am now on laptop which is connected to desktop (10.0.0.1)
2006-12-03T09:18:00.000Z	aeromix	jrib	do I need to allow ssh in firestarter? or sth like that?
2006-12-03T09:19:00.000Z	jrib	aeromix	yeah, port 22
2006-12-03T09:19:00.000Z	aeromix	jrib	how can I do it?
2006-12-03T09:19:00.000Z	jrib	aeromix	it's pretty straightforward, just run firestarter and allow connections to port 22
2006-12-03T09:21:00.000Z	aeromix	jrib	cool it works:) tnx
2007-01-06T07:39:00.000Z	jrib	aeromix	do you know you can do time/step?  You can condense that long thing you have there into */3
2007-01-06T07:39:00.000Z	aeromix	jrib	no.. I'll try tnx
2007-01-06T07:39:00.000Z	jrib	aeromix	it should still work the way you have it though
2007-01-06T07:40:00.000Z	aeromix	jrib	yep it works now..tnx
