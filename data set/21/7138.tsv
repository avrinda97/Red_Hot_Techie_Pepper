2008-05-01T08:41:00.000Z	shane2peru	Crusader_Tech	are the special effects enabled?  Is the sound choppy to, or just the picture
2008-05-01T08:41:00.000Z	Crusader_Tech	shane2peru	seems just the video.
2008-05-01T08:41:00.000Z	shane2peru	Crusader_Tech	try shutting off special effects like this:
2008-05-01T08:42:00.000Z	shane2peru	Crusader_Tech	System -> Preferences -> Appearance, the the last tab and select no special effects
2008-05-01T08:43:00.000Z	Crusader_Tech	shane2peru	Dont you think a 6800 with 256 dedicate ram is enough to handle all that?
2008-05-01T08:43:00.000Z	shane2peru	Crusader_Tech	I don't know, I think those special effects just have problems with video, and some games
2008-05-01T08:44:00.000Z	shane2peru	Crusader_Tech	I'm working on a 64bit with 1.5GB of ram and disabled them
2008-05-01T08:44:00.000Z	shane2peru	Crusader_Tech	it isn't a hardware issue, it is a conflict of software
2008-05-01T08:44:00.000Z	shane2peru	Crusader_Tech	I think that is. :)
2008-05-01T08:44:00.000Z	Crusader_Tech	shane2peru	I'm about to wipe windows ( i'm running Ubuntu with Wubi ) so I was just curious.
2008-05-01T08:45:00.000Z	Crusader_Tech	shane2peru	will i'm going to give it a shot right now.  Thanks for the input.  I appreciate it.
2008-05-01T08:45:00.000Z	shane2peru	Crusader_Tech	no prob. I love the special effects, and they have come a long way, but they haven't arrived yet. :)
2008-05-01T08:46:00.000Z	Crusader_Tech	shane2peru	They dont seem to have arrived in Vista yet either, so it's all good.
2008-05-01T08:46:00.000Z	shane2peru	Crusader_Tech	ha ha, I think they are even more advanced in the Linux world, just some video and gaming issues. :)
2008-05-01T08:47:00.000Z	Crusader_Tech	shane2peru	well i'm off to format.  I'm even going to try putting XP in a VirtualBox VM.
2008-05-01T08:47:00.000Z	shane2peru	Crusader_Tech	did that work?
2008-05-01T08:48:00.000Z	Crusader_Tech	shane2peru	I'm typing to you in windows right now, so I can't say.  After I install Ubuntu, I'll give it a shot.
2008-05-01T08:48:00.000Z	shane2peru	Crusader_Tech	ahh, ok, that is usually one of the problems that I have run into, hope it helps.  After the video you can re-enable the effects. :)
2008-05-01T08:48:00.000Z	shane2peru	Crusader_Tech	see ya.
2008-05-01T08:48:00.000Z	Crusader_Tech	shane2peru	Thanks again
2008-05-01T08:49:00.000Z	shane2peru	Crusader_Tech	no prob.
