2006-12-05T09:23:00.000Z	dreamer		hmm, I can't connect with vnc to my desktop, when I'm sure I have vnc enabled, where can I check this and how do I enable vnc-access over ssh ?
2006-12-05T09:23:00.000Z	Gumby	dreamer	the server running vnc server probably isnt using vnc over ssh.
2006-12-05T09:24:00.000Z	Gumby	dreamer	from the client box try and telnet to the server box on port 5900
2006-12-05T09:24:00.000Z	dreamer	Gumby	I just meant that I can access the pc over ssh, but I can't connect with VNCviewer
2006-12-05T09:24:00.000Z	Gumby	dreamer	ie:  telnet 192.168.1.100 5900
2006-12-05T09:25:00.000Z	dreamer	Gumby	can I do this in pyttu also (/me on a windows machine atm)
2006-12-05T09:25:00.000Z	Gumby	dreamer	you can do it from a windows console also
2006-12-05T09:26:00.000Z	dreamer	Gumby	nothing really happens ...
2006-12-05T09:26:00.000Z	Gumby	dreamer	define "nothing"
2006-12-05T09:27:00.000Z	dreamer	Gumby	I think the connection refused
2006-12-05T09:28:00.000Z	Gumby	dreamer	ok, then either a firewall is blocking it or vnc isnt running
2006-12-05T09:28:00.000Z	Gumby	dreamer	how did you start the vnc server?
2006-12-05T09:29:00.000Z	dreamer	Gumby	I think I enabled vnc access a while ago on my desktop, from the menu, but .. that was in gnome, I have kde running atm, so could it be it isn't enabled in kde yet ?
2006-12-05T09:29:00.000Z	Gumby	dreamer	what is the output of netstat -tpan |grep 5900
2006-12-05T09:29:00.000Z	dreamer	Gumby	if I do that with ssh on the machine itself ?
2006-12-05T09:30:00.000Z	Gumby	dreamer	yep
2006-12-05T09:30:00.000Z	dreamer	Gumby	says nothing
2006-12-05T09:30:00.000Z	Gumby	dreamer	ok, then vnc isnt running
2006-12-05T09:31:00.000Z	Gumby	dreamer	you might be able to...  you can try doing DISPLAY=:0 vino-server
2006-12-05T09:32:00.000Z	Gumby	dreamer	DISPLAY=:0 vino-server & might be better
2006-12-05T09:32:00.000Z	Gumby	dreamer	hrm, you must have some other vnc server installed then.  of course I have no idea what that might be
