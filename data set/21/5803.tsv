2007-08-04T06:35:00.000Z	cornell-M		Got it, jetscreamer, what to do now?  Edit the xorg.conf?
2007-08-04T06:35:00.000Z	jetscreamer	cornell-M	you can do that, but dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg is the preferred method (less mistakes)
2007-08-04T06:37:00.000Z	jetscreamer	cornell-M	the lspci|grepVGA told you what to use.. was it intel? i forget
2007-08-04T06:37:00.000Z	jetscreamer	cornell-M	you can shell out to another console and do it
2007-08-04T06:38:00.000Z	cornell-M	jetscreamer	nvideo as I recall, would that be "nv"
2007-08-04T06:41:00.000Z	cornell-M	jetscreamer	Geez...    amount of memory in the card...   How do I find that one?
2007-08-04T06:41:00.000Z	jetscreamer	cornell-M	leave it blank.. also leave the pci id thingy blank (unless you run dual vidcards)
2007-08-04T06:42:00.000Z	cornell-M	jetscreamer	Use kernel framebuffer device interface? (yes/no)
2007-08-04T06:42:00.000Z	jetscreamer	cornell-M	no not if it's an nvidia card
2007-08-04T06:47:00.000Z	jetscreamer	cornell-M	btw i should have told you to install read-edid and mdetect while you were installing hwinfo
2007-08-04T06:48:00.000Z	jetscreamer	cornell-M	no biggie
2007-08-04T06:48:00.000Z	jetscreamer	cornell-M	//etc/init.d/gdm start  should do you
2007-08-04T06:50:00.000Z	jetscreamer	cornell-M	no bigge don't worry about it
2007-08-04T06:50:00.000Z	jetscreamer	cornell-M	//etc/init.d/gdm start  should do you mpw
2007-08-04T06:51:00.000Z	jetscreamer	cornell-M	sidp /etc/init.d/gdm start
2007-08-04T06:51:00.000Z	jetscreamer	cornell-M	that's ass-u-me-ing you have gdm isntalled
2007-08-04T06:51:00.000Z	jetscreamer	cornell-M	startx if you don't
2007-08-04T06:52:00.000Z	jetscreamer	cornell-M	grep EE /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2007-08-04T06:52:00.000Z	jetscreamer	cornell-M	your monitor is configured properly afaik. 'must' be something else
2007-08-04T06:59:00.000Z	jetscreamer	cornell-M	i'm not really sure, but if you're running nvidia there are directives you can put in xorg.conf to compensate for stuff... setting the proper h&v rates is what fixes that afact, too.. hmmm.
2007-08-04T07:00:00.000Z	cornell-M	jetscreamer	it seems there's two places where there's a h-position.  In one the little window moves, in the other the desktop moves... .never seen that one before.
