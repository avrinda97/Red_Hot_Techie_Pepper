2006-11-27T09:14:00.000Z	bimberi	hajiki	ah, that's in Gnome.  Are you using another desktop environment?
2006-11-27T09:16:00.000Z	bimberi	hajiki	so you right-click on an empty desktop and there's no "Create Launcher..." in the context menu (2nd in the list here - Dapper)?

2006-11-27T09:22:00.000Z	bimberi	hajiki	RIGHT-click on the word Applications
2006-11-27T09:23:00.000Z	bimberi	hajiki	there should be no "Add/Remove..." but "Edit Menus" should be in the list that pops up
