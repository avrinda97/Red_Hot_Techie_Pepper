2011-04-14T18:41:00.000Z	snu		i am dual booting mac os and windows. I can't afford to partition my system, as it will lead to a mess. Can i install ubuntu using Wubi without affecting mac os and windows installations?

2011-04-14T18:44:00.000Z	snu		i mean is it safe to tryout along with mac os boot?
2011-04-14T18:44:00.000Z	snu		am not having a mac!! its a dell
2011-04-14T18:45:00.000Z	snu		i had problems when i tried opensuse which created extra partitions
2011-04-14T18:46:00.000Z	snu		i had 3 trials for getting mac n windows to work together. But i miss my linux :(
2011-04-14T18:48:00.000Z	snu		i believe wubi only creates a file in c: drive and a boot entry.. So it should be safe, right?
2011-04-14T18:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	snu	correct
2011-04-14T18:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	snu	it will also be affected by fragmentation as the data is stored in NTFS
2011-04-14T18:50:00.000Z	snu	ActionParsnip	thank u :) i think i should try it.. wish me luck
2011-04-14T18:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	snu	its good as a quick try before youbuybut as a long term solution I recommend a true install
2011-04-14T18:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	snu	what version of windows are you running?
2011-04-14T18:52:00.000Z	snu	ActionParsnip	win 7
2011-04-14T18:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	snu	win7 can resize its partitions to make space which you can then install ubuntu to
2011-04-14T18:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	snu	not sure, we don't support illegal practises here
2011-04-14T18:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	snu	I'd check the mac license
2011-04-14T18:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	snu	as long as you resize the ntfs partition you will leave free space which can then be used for Ubuntu, it won't touch anything else
2011-04-14T18:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	snu	and I can read lowercase too, so don't bother with caps next time
2011-04-14T18:55:00.000Z	snu	ActionParsnip	hmm.. i am afraid of partitioning ;) so i guess i'll stich with wubi
2011-04-14T18:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	snu	your choice, ntfs will directly affect performance
2011-04-14T18:57:00.000Z	snu	ActionParsnip	thank u
