2010-08-03T19:24:00.000Z	magicstuff	mahn	I tried to setup a dual boot today..messed it up somehow..
2010-08-03T19:29:00.000Z	mahn	magicstuff	can you use pastebin.com and copy all of /boot/grub/grub.cfg into it?
2010-08-03T19:35:00.000Z	magicstuff	mahn	this is the only instance of windows 7   memuentry "Windows 7 (loader) (on /dev/sda2)" { insmod ntfs set root='(hd0,2)' serach --no-floppy --fs-uuid etc...etc"
2010-08-03T19:37:00.000Z	mahn	magicstuff	 okay, try this:  'sudo gedit /etc/grub.d/40_custom
2010-08-03T19:37:00.000Z	mahn	magicstuff	let me use pastebin

2010-08-03T19:39:00.000Z	mahn	magicstuff	you're on a live CD, correct?
2010-08-03T19:43:00.000Z	magicstuff	mahn	this might be easier if I could get a damn connection on this lappy
2010-08-03T19:45:00.000Z	mahn	magicstuff	sorry about the delay, had something to do
2010-08-03T19:46:00.000Z	mahn	magicstuff	so are you re-installing ubuntu, or what is going on?
2010-08-03T19:46:00.000Z	magicstuff	mahn	I installed ubuntu..tried a dual boot
2010-08-03T19:47:00.000Z	mahn	magicstuff	well, there's some reason grub isn't picking up windows. but you can manually add an entry for it
2010-08-03T19:48:00.000Z	mahn	magicstuff	it's just a matter of identifying your windows and plugging it in
2010-08-03T19:48:00.000Z	magicstuff	mahn	mind running me threw this?
2010-08-03T19:48:00.000Z	mahn	magicstuff	that's what i've been trying to do, but we can start at step 1 :P
2010-08-03T19:49:00.000Z	mahn	magicstuff	let me look up one command
2010-08-03T20:01:00.000Z	magicstuff	mahn	back in a few...grabbing some chips..pm me when you get back...
2010-08-03T20:02:00.000Z	mahn	magicstuff	sorry having a hard time finding something
