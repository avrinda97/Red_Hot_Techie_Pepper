2009-11-03T19:31:00.000Z	Tartaros		how do I tell grub2 to regenerate grub.conf?\
2009-11-03T19:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tartaros	sudo update-grub
2009-11-05T17:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tartaros	you may find they are one and the same
2009-11-05T17:24:00.000Z	Tartaros	ActionParsnip	are they really? so why do I have both - is it cos I had gparted left over from 9.04, which I wouldn't have if I had clean install of 9.10?
2009-11-05T17:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tartaros	makes sense, run alacarte and see what commands both entries execute
2009-11-05T17:25:00.000Z	Tartaros	ActionParsnip	oh, well no it's not that they look the same, the programs look totally different
2009-11-05T17:26:00.000Z	Tartaros	ActionParsnip	I thought what you meant is that they have the same "backend" or something
2009-11-05T17:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tartaros	well choose whichever you prefer
2009-11-05T17:26:00.000Z	Tartaros	ActionParsnip	I was more like asking about which one of them is more compatible with other parts of ubuntu
2009-11-05T17:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tartaros	no like, movie player is just totem but with a noob friendly name in the menu
2009-11-05T17:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tartaros	they are both equal
2009-11-05T17:26:00.000Z	Tartaros	ActionParsnip	ok then fair enough, thanks :D
2009-11-05T17:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tartaros	just use the one that suits your needs
2009-11-06T19:14:00.000Z	Tartaros	ActionParsnip	typo! :P
2009-11-06T19:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tartaros	coffee wore off, new one now
2009-11-06T19:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tartaros	i just used: apt-cache search hex
2009-11-06T19:15:00.000Z	Tartaros	ActionParsnip	yeah tried that too, too many hits so I asked about a suggestion here... :)
2009-11-06T19:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tartaros	jut read the output, there it was
2009-11-20T14:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tartaros	i think like a prtition image
2009-11-24T03:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tartaros	sure it does, dns could be failing
2009-11-24T03:02:00.000Z	Tartaros	ActionParsnip	/facepalm. I'm trying to get more info out of him, not speculate what could be wrong
