2010-01-13T12:11:00.000Z	sidd		hi, does grub need to be installed on the same partition that is discovered in "find /grub/stage1" ?
2010-01-13T12:11:00.000Z	Awesome3000	sidd	 No that's where it is already installed
2010-01-13T12:12:00.000Z	sidd	Awesome3000	am having an acute problem. i have a laptop that had winxp and ubuntu 9.10
2010-01-13T12:14:00.000Z	Awesome3000	sidd	 okay then just install where it was found which will rewrite the mbr
2010-01-13T12:14:00.000Z	sidd	Awesome3000	so was grub-install(hd0,1) correct or should i do grub-install(0,4) ?
2010-01-13T12:15:00.000Z	Awesome3000	sidd	 sounds like you installed grub into the windows partition. Do you have a windows disk?
2010-01-13T12:16:00.000Z	sidd	Awesome3000	i have the vista disk
2010-01-13T12:17:00.000Z	sidd	Awesome3000	hd(0,0) has some dell test utilities
2010-01-13T12:18:00.000Z	Awesome3000	sidd	 Boot from that to restore the Windose boot loader on the partition then install grub to the boot partition
2010-01-13T12:19:00.000Z	sidd	Awesome3000	so after ensure vista is booting normally, i boot from rescue disk and say grub-install (hd0,4) which is the ubuntu / partition?
2010-01-13T12:19:00.000Z	Awesome3000	sidd	 Yeah also the ubuntu partition needs to be the boot partition
2010-01-13T12:20:00.000Z	sidd	Awesome3000	ok, will try that first
2010-01-13T12:21:00.000Z	Awesome3000	sidd	 hd0,0  might not be formated with a usable filesystem
2010-01-13T12:27:00.000Z	Awesome3000	sidd	 so can you boot both now
2010-01-13T12:27:00.000Z	sidd	Awesome3000	i just booted vista from the grub menu. am checking ubuntu now
2010-01-13T12:29:00.000Z	sidd	Awesome3000	yep, both are working. still scratching my head trying to figure out what must've happened!
2010-01-13T12:30:00.000Z	Awesome3000	sidd	 I think you installed grub to boot on the windoze partition
2010-01-13T12:31:00.000Z	sidd	Awesome3000	could be.
2010-01-13T12:37:00.000Z	sidd	Awesome3000	ok, one last question. mbr is always on the disk and not on some partition of the disk right?
2010-01-13T12:38:00.000Z	Awesome3000	sidd	 The master Boot Record tells the computer which partition to boot(It is on the Disk not a partition)  Well the boot loader is in a partition.
2010-01-13T12:41:00.000Z	sidd	Awesome3000	thanks.
