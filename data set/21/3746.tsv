2008-10-15T06:42:00.000Z	RHorse	mib_mkjis0wo	it would help if you knew the mfg of the drive you are trying to find. Do you know that or can find out?
2008-10-15T06:44:00.000Z	RHorse	mib_mkjis0wo	does it boot at all, or it is trying to find the drive to boot from?
2008-10-15T06:47:00.000Z	RHorse	mib_mkjis0wo	I am still not sure what the problem is? Does it boot off of the disk in the cdrom?
2008-10-15T06:48:00.000Z	RHorse	mib_mkjis0wo	ok, then what drive is it trying to find a driver for? the hard drive?
2008-10-15T06:49:00.000Z	RHorse	mib_mkjis0wo	well, you need to write down exactly what the error message says. Ubuntu is usu. good in provinding info to solve a problem. ( unlike some other os's).
