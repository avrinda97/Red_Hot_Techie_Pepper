2004-12-09T11:39:00.000Z	CRBVegas		i need a linuxian - english translater, can anyone help?
2004-12-09T11:41:00.000Z	CRBVegas		this may sound kind of basic...  but i don't know what this means: You don't have SMB support installed. Please install SMB support in the system to enable file sharing in Windows networks
2004-12-09T11:41:00.000Z	CRBVegas		i just moved from windows.
2004-12-09T11:41:00.000Z	CRBVegas		get samba
2004-12-09T11:42:00.000Z	CRBVegas		i checked there website, and im not sure if that is good for this distro of linux
2004-12-09T11:42:00.000Z	CRBVegas		there was not compiled binaries.. (am i making sence?)  for ubuntu
2004-12-09T11:42:00.000Z	eruin	CRBVegas	open a terminal
2004-12-09T11:44:00.000Z	eruin	CRBVegas	are you in gnome?
2004-12-09T11:45:00.000Z	eruin	CRBVegas	well, we all feel that way at some point ;P
2004-12-09T11:46:00.000Z	eruin	CRBVegas	same thing you get if you press CTRL+ALT+F1
2004-12-09T11:46:00.000Z	eruin	CRBVegas	to get back from that, press ALT+7
2004-12-09T11:48:00.000Z	eruin	CRBVegas	ah, yeah, another thing you'd probably like to look at (to avoid using the terminal for now) is the "computer" menu at top... select that, then goto system configuration -> synaptic
2004-12-09T11:48:00.000Z	eruin	CRBVegas	that's a nice searchable GUI interface for apt-get ;)
2004-12-09T11:52:00.000Z	eruin	CRBVegas	yeah, did you install samba yet?
2004-12-09T11:52:00.000Z	eruin	CRBVegas	using that command I gave you earlier
2004-12-09T11:54:00.000Z	eruin	CRBVegas	yeah, after that's finished and installed, you should be able to browse your windows netowrk
2004-12-09T11:55:00.000Z	eruin	CRBVegas	oh, I'm the wrong person to ask about that ;D
