2005-05-21T08:09:00.000Z	phoenixp3k		I've got a problem and can't seem to set it right
2005-05-21T08:10:00.000Z	phoenixp3k		How can I make a user able to use sudo
2005-05-21T08:10:00.000Z	Burgundavia	phoenixp3k	add them to the admin group
2005-05-21T08:10:00.000Z	phoenixp3k	Burgundavia	can't access it, it asks for the root password, but it doesn't work
2005-05-21T08:11:00.000Z	Burgundavia	phoenixp3k	have you read www.ubuntu.com/wiki/RootSudo
2005-05-21T08:11:00.000Z	phoenixp3k	Burgundavia	not that again... I've read it. It doesn't help, doesn't tell me how to access admin configuration tools
2005-05-21T08:12:00.000Z	Burgundavia	phoenixp3k	you need to edit the user in system-->admin-->users and groups
2005-05-21T08:13:00.000Z	phoenixp3k	Burgundavia	yes I want to do that, but when I click on it, I asks for the root password, and refuses it.
2005-05-21T08:25:00.000Z	Burgundavia	phoenixp3k	the password you logged in with?
2005-05-21T08:25:00.000Z	Burgundavia	phoenixp3k	have you set a root password?
2005-05-21T08:25:00.000Z	Burgundavia	phoenixp3k	all the gui tools are looking for your password
2005-05-21T08:26:00.000Z	Burgundavia	phoenixp3k	I would disable it, as Ubuntu uses sudo for everything
2005-05-21T08:26:00.000Z	phoenixp3k	Burgundavia	how do I do that?
2005-05-21T08:26:00.000Z	Burgundavia	phoenixp3k	see the bottom of the rootsudo page
2005-05-21T08:28:00.000Z	phoenixp3k	Burgundavia	done, do I have to restart of something? It's still not working
2005-05-21T08:29:00.000Z	Burgundavia	phoenixp3k	are you logging in as the user you created during install?
2005-05-21T08:30:00.000Z	Burgundavia	phoenixp3k	did you choose expert install?
2005-05-21T08:31:00.000Z	Burgundavia	phoenixp3k	ok then, log in as the user that was created during the install
2005-05-21T08:31:00.000Z	Burgundavia	phoenixp3k	that is not a root user
2005-05-21T08:32:00.000Z	phoenixp3k	Burgundavia	well I'm logged
