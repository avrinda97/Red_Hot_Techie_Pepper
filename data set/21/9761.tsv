2005-07-16T16:37:00.000Z	Ang3lFir3		im getting the impression that i may end up installing 2k as documentation for networking issues in ubuntu seems to be extremely lacking
2005-07-16T16:37:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Ang3lFir3	what's the problem?
2005-07-16T16:37:00.000Z	Ang3lFir3	jasoncohen	I am finding no answers as of yet as to why my 8139too based smc2-1211tx nic can ping both internal and extrenal addresses as well as dns external names but can not telnet/http/irc anything..... any help?
2005-07-16T16:38:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Ang3lFir3	did you try google?
2005-07-16T16:38:00.000Z	Ang3lFir3	jasoncohen	ohhh yes
2005-07-16T16:38:00.000Z	Ang3lFir3	jasoncohen	i been googling this issue for several hours
2005-07-16T16:39:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Ang3lFir3	just found this http://www.ozzu.com/ftopic20882.html
2005-07-16T16:40:00.000Z	Ang3lFir3	jasoncohen	there suggestion is to install freebsd :p
2005-07-16T16:41:00.000Z	Ang3lFir3	jasoncohen	and i do have the correct module and driver and its the only pci card in system
2005-07-16T16:41:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Ang3lFir3	a) are you sure it's the nic and not the network, b) do you have rtl8139 loaded?
2005-07-16T16:42:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Ang3lFir3	do you use DHCP? did it get an IP from the gateway? is this is the only machine with problems?
2005-07-16T16:42:00.000Z	Ang3lFir3	jasoncohen	a) no ....but i am using the network now on 2k b) yes its loaded and shows in the device manager
2005-07-16T16:42:00.000Z	Ang3lFir3	jasoncohen	yes dhcp yes it has an ip and yes its the only machine with problems
2005-07-16T16:43:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Ang3lFir3	did you try with a static IP or another nic?
2005-07-16T16:43:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Ang3lFir3	is this the only linux distro you've used?
2005-07-16T16:43:00.000Z	Ang3lFir3	jasoncohen	another nic is my next step but i need to know if ubuntu will recognize it or will i need to find and load the drivers
2005-07-16T16:44:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Ang3lFir3	in my experience most drivers are loaded automatically with hotplug
2005-07-16T16:44:00.000Z	Ang3lFir3	jasoncohen	i've had a rh shell and a few unix shells but im no pro
2005-07-16T16:45:00.000Z	Ang3lFir3	jasoncohen	also all the nics i have are rtl8139 based so should that matter?
2005-07-16T05:04:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Ang3lFir3	you used a new card? perhaps the old card was defective
2005-07-16T05:04:00.000Z	jasoncohen	Ang3lFir3	does this card use the same driver?
