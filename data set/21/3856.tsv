2009-02-22T05:43:00.000Z	nclife	redvamp128	says wine is already the newest version
2009-02-22T05:34:00.000Z	redvamp128	nclife	 ask in #winehq  (but to answer your question you need to put those files inside the program folder (or the where) the program is that you want to fix)
2009-02-22T05:35:00.000Z	redvamp128	nclife	 just make sure you don't overwrite the native ones inside the /.wine/drive_c/windows folder
2009-02-22T05:36:00.000Z	nclife	redvamp128	mh. The howto I read said I should add the to C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32, is that the same than ~/.wine/windows/system32?
2009-02-22T05:37:00.000Z	redvamp128	nclife	 NO that will Break Wine
2009-02-22T05:37:00.000Z	nclife	redvamp128	how can I acces C: ... from the cl then?
2009-02-22T05:38:00.000Z	redvamp128	nclife	 I just hope you didn't overwrite them or else you will have to reinstall wine
2009-02-22T05:38:00.000Z	nclife	redvamp128	hehe, i did overwrite one... :s
2009-02-22T05:39:00.000Z	redvamp128	nclife	 basically simple easy-- lets say you want to use fix dcom38.dll (just a fake example)- and you choose use native dcom38.dll you just put it in folder of the program you are trying to fix in the program folder or the folder where you are trying to run it.
2009-02-22T05:40:00.000Z	redvamp128	nclife	 and then you use the wine configure to point to the .exe of the file and choose the use native dcom38.dll  (then if it is in that folder where the .exe) it will then use it
2009-02-22T05:40:00.000Z	redvamp128	nclife	 you may want to reinstall wine
2009-02-22T05:40:00.000Z	nclife	redvamp128	yep. What's the command for that agian?
2009-02-22T05:41:00.000Z	redvamp128	nclife	 what version of wine did you have?
2009-02-22T05:41:00.000Z	nclife	redvamp128	1.0.1 I believe
2009-02-22T05:42:00.000Z	redvamp128	nclife	 you could try sudo apte-get install wine
2009-02-22T05:42:00.000Z	redvamp128	nclife	 sudo apt-get install wine
2009-02-22T05:43:00.000Z	redvamp128	nclife	 though you should probably -- go into synaptic package manger and uninstall wine there then reinstall it.
2009-02-22T05:43:00.000Z	redvamp128	nclife	 do you understand now-- how the use native works?
2009-02-22T05:43:00.000Z	nclife	redvamp128	to be totally honest, not quiet. :p
2009-02-22T05:44:00.000Z	redvamp128	nclife	 pm?
2009-02-22T07:27:00.000Z	redvamp128	nclife	 you could ask in #winehq
