2007-08-23T12:00:00.000Z	Bucketface		Anyway...

2007-08-23T12:00:00.000Z	Bucketface		They're the stats in case that's important
2007-08-23T12:01:00.000Z	Bucketface		But ya, I was using the liveCD and I thought "Hmm, it says some usb broadband modems don't work, it's the only means of internet I have so I better try it"
2007-08-23T12:01:00.000Z	Bucketface		The thing wasn't detected
2007-08-23T12:01:00.000Z	Bucketface		at all
2007-08-23T12:02:00.000Z	Bucketface		o.
2007-08-23T12:03:00.000Z	Bucketface		So anyway, usb broadband modem, wasn't detected. However, a regular USB flashdrive was recognised and I could open it and stuff... How do I get my usb broadband modem to work! It's kinda important.
2007-08-23T12:04:00.000Z	PriceChild	Bucketface	http://eciadsl.flashtux.org/ i think
2007-08-23T14:14:00.000Z	PriceChild	Bucketface	how does it connect to the machine?
2007-08-23T14:19:00.000Z	PriceChild	Bucketface	this "modem"... it draws power from the pc.... requires the usb connection?
2007-08-23T14:20:00.000Z	PriceChild	Bucketface	or is it one with the option of ethernet/wireless/usb ?
2007-08-23T14:20:00.000Z	PriceChild	Bucketface	eciadsl.flashtux.org was always good to me for usb adsl but yours isn't listed there :(

2007-08-23T14:26:00.000Z	PriceChild	Bucketface	you're on feisty right?
2007-08-23T14:27:00.000Z	PriceChild	Bucketface	"lsb_release -a" just to be sure
2007-08-23T14:27:00.000Z	PriceChild	Bucketface	ok well that guide is pretty good.... print it off or save it somewhere to read it whilst on ubunut.
2007-08-23T14:28:00.000Z	PriceChild	Bucketface	as long as you're on feisty it should be fine
2007-08-23T14:29:00.000Z	PriceChild	Bucketface	well those instructions will work, use them :)
2007-08-23T14:29:00.000Z	PriceChild	Bucketface	'dmesg' is a program you should start in a terminal before plugging in the modem to be sure
