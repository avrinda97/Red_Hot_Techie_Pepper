2006-09-27T12:06:00.000Z	scheuri	trappist	if you have set a password for root, it is possible...:)
2006-09-27T12:07:00.000Z	trappist	scheuri	yes.  that would suck.
2006-09-27T12:07:00.000Z	scheuri	trappist	well, I do that too, sometimes....some people like to have root...and sometimes it is a security risk to have sudoers
2006-09-27T12:08:00.000Z	trappist	scheuri	it's a security risk to have an account with root privileges.  at least with sudoers, if something went wrong, you know who did it.
2006-09-27T12:08:00.000Z	scheuri	trappist	true...but if the account with sudo-priviliges has a weak password....well....
2006-09-27T12:09:00.000Z	scheuri	trappist	and I am taking about the one which comes with the first install (which has ALL rights root has)
2006-09-27T12:09:00.000Z	trappist	scheuri	then you shouldn't be allowed near a computer, and you're just as likely to give root a bad password
2006-09-27T12:09:00.000Z	scheuri	trappist	LjL....yes...that is why I said it MIGHT be also risky having sudoers...:)
2006-09-27T12:10:00.000Z	scheuri	trappist	and LjL...sudoers alone does not make a machine more secure...it is ALWAYS the password (as well)
2006-09-27T12:11:00.000Z	trappist	scheuri	honestly, I do key-only ssh then do ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL in sudoers
2006-09-27T12:11:00.000Z	scheuri	trappist	well, that is another story...not many people do this (and I am not judging now that they should or not. etc.)
2006-09-27T12:12:00.000Z	trappist	scheuri	that's good, because most "normal" users are happy to throw any and all security out the door in the name of convenience
2006-09-27T12:13:00.000Z	scheuri	trappist	I know...that bothers me...but still...it is just how it works...:(
2006-09-27T12:13:00.000Z	trappist	scheuri	in the end you can't bottle security.  it's in the hands of the user/admin.
2006-09-27T12:14:00.000Z	scheuri	trappist	indeed...that is where teaching comes into play
2006-09-27T12:14:00.000Z	trappist	scheuri	make a group called, say, oousers, and make the oo apps executable only by them
2006-09-27T12:15:00.000Z	scheuri	trappist	aye...thought about that too...probably "easiest" way
2006-09-27T12:15:00.000Z	scheuri	trappist	however, it means that I need to regroup ALL applications which somehow are affected by my rules
2006-09-27T12:17:00.000Z	trappist	scheuri	I've only ever bothered with that for gcc, which once saved me from getting hit by the slapper worm, since my openssl was out of date and I had gcc on a webserver, both of which were bad.  but chmodding gcc kept me from getting nailed.
2006-09-27T12:18:00.000Z	scheuri	trappist	aye....sounds good....its just that I am about to set up a machine used in a library by guests (for surfing and printing only) and their employes (for mailing with clients and OOo as well)
2006-09-27T12:18:00.000Z	scheuri	trappist	in a library used by guests
