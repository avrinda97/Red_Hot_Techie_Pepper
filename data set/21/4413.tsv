2008-04-30T09:18:00.000Z	DrifterSX		well i havent tried it in 8.04 but my guess is a big no no
2008-04-30T09:19:00.000Z	DrifterSX		umm change any video file from avi, divx etc to mp4 and transfer it onto my psp all in one click
2008-04-30T09:19:00.000Z	DrifterSX		oo a memory card lol
2008-04-30T09:19:00.000Z	calc	DrifterSX	there is probably a tool to do that, i stream videos/music/photos from Ubuntu to my PS3, was easy
2008-04-30T09:22:00.000Z	calc	DrifterSX	pspvideo9 uses ffmpeg, which is originally a linux app
2008-04-30T09:22:00.000Z	calc	DrifterSX	so just use ffmpeg directly and tell it to output psp format
2008-04-30T09:24:00.000Z	calc	DrifterSX	i'm pretty sure clicking install ffmpeg in synaptic doesn't involve any of those steps
2008-04-30T09:25:00.000Z	calc	DrifterSX	dunno, i never had the time to actually encode a video for my psp
2008-04-30T09:25:00.000Z	calc	DrifterSX	i just play emu games on it :)
2008-04-30T09:26:00.000Z	calc	DrifterSX	very easy to hack now with pandora battery, offtopic though
2008-04-30T09:27:00.000Z	DrifterSX	calc	u need to learn me that stuff
2008-04-30T09:27:00.000Z	calc	DrifterSX	search on google for "pandora's battery"
2008-04-30T09:33:00.000Z	calc	DrifterSX	oh pspvc, i have no idea about it at all, don't have a ps3 camera
2008-04-30T09:33:00.000Z	calc	DrifterSX	someone else was talking about pspvc
