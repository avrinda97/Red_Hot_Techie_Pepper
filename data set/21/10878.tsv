2004-10-27T12:58:00.000Z	Keybuk		so you make one app work differently from the rest ... and that's *good* ?!
2004-10-27T12:58:00.000Z	Keybuk		it's not about winning
2004-10-27T12:59:00.000Z	Keybuk		GNOME isn't about beating KDE, it's just about writing a desktop environment some people might like
2004-10-27T12:59:00.000Z	Keybuk		and those that don't like it can use the other desktop environments that are more suited to their tastes
2004-10-27T12:59:00.000Z	Keybuk		do one thing, and do it well
2004-10-27T12:59:00.000Z	Keybuk		not do everything, just to get that one extra user
2004-10-27T13:00:00.000Z	Keybuk		I get asked a huge amount why I don't make it easier in Debian for people to build the system from source "like Gentoo"
2004-10-27T13:00:00.000Z	Keybuk		my reply is that if people want to build their system from source, they should *use* Gentoo
2004-10-27T13:00:00.000Z	Keybuk		hrm, Qt is to KDE as GTK+ is to GNOME
2004-10-27T13:00:00.000Z	Keybuk		it's just the X toolkit underneath

2004-10-30T14:24:00.000Z	Keybuk	Lathiat	yeah, but if you want to unpack .debs without dpkg (like, say, if you rm /usr) you need ar
2004-10-30T14:30:00.000Z	Lathiat	Keybuk	are you serious? :P

2004-10-30T14:32:00.000Z	Keybuk	Lathiat	ar is a good old-fashioned UNIX file format.  Headers are plain text, terminating in a new line :p
