2010-01-20T22:31:00.000Z	tlir		what is the most recent/stable kernel available for 8.04.2 in the repos?
2010-01-20T22:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tlir	uhmm you should get whatever it is as an update, if you don't already have it
2010-01-20T22:33:00.000Z	tlir	sebsebseb	apt-get upgrade doesn't recommend to upgrade the kernel
2010-01-20T22:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tlir	ok why do you want later kernel?]
2010-01-20T22:33:00.000Z	tlir	sebsebseb	read my previous post?
2010-01-20T22:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tlir	I didn't see you give a reason for wanting a later kernel
2010-01-20T22:34:00.000Z	tlir	sebsebseb	﻿my machine just got freezed and last thing in syslog was " Bad page state in process 'mysqld' page:c169a320 flags:0x40000040 mapping:00000000 mapcount:17 count:0"  described more elaborately here: http://pastebin.ca/1759148 - it is running 8.04.2 with kernel 2.6.24-23-server. ﻿according to https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/235676 it seems to be a kernel error
2010-01-20T22:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tlir	oh well it seems to be something to do with mysql
2010-01-20T22:35:00.000Z	tlir	sebsebseb	either that or the kernel :)
2010-01-20T22:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tlir	there is bound to be a ppa on launchpad for a later kernel for 8.04, however it's ueasuly best for people to stay with the standard kernels.   plus since ppa's aren't fully  supported shoudn't get loads of them, and they might cause issues when you upgrade Ubuntu
2010-01-20T22:37:00.000Z	tlir	sebsebseb	I'm currently running 2.6.24-23. I'm seeing that there's linux-image-2.6.24-26-server available in apt-get search results
2010-01-20T22:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tlir	you got the 8.04 server version?
2010-01-20T22:37:00.000Z	tlir	sebsebseb	yes I'm running 8.04.2
2010-01-20T22:39:00.000Z	tlir	sebsebseb	seems that 2.6.24-26-server is available for install
2010-01-20T22:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tlir	from the repo?
2010-01-20T22:40:00.000Z	tlir	sebsebseb	yeah, it's available
2010-01-20T22:40:00.000Z	tlir	sebsebseb	and the bug isn't related to mysql, it's related to the kernel.
2010-01-20T22:40:00.000Z	tlir	sebsebseb	all google results I'm getting about this bug are all showing up 8.04.2 system
2010-01-20T22:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tlir	get all your updates 8.04.4 or something it is now the latest
2010-01-20T22:40:00.000Z	tlir	sebsebseb	here http://www.mail-archive.com/ubuntu-bugs@lists.ubuntu.com/msg1336598.html  here https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/328186 and here https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/235676
2010-01-20T22:41:00.000Z	tlir	sebsebseb	what would be the standard way of getting all updates? apt-get upgrade ?
