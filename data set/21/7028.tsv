2007-01-16T12:36:00.000Z	jb0nd38372		Anyone else care to try and tackle this build problem I'm having? or possibly shed some insight?
2007-01-16T12:38:00.000Z	n2diy	jb0nd38372	with linux, by the time you right the book, it is already out of date.
2007-01-16T12:39:00.000Z	jb0nd38372	n2diy	I hear that.. I wish I had the technical skill to figure this out.. but i'm stumpped at the moment.. it's nothing critical  Just something I wanted to accomplish
2007-01-16T12:40:00.000Z	n2diy	jb0nd38372	I just jumped in, and caught your reference to docs, but I missed what your issue is.
2007-01-16T12:41:00.000Z	jb0nd38372		I'm trying to complie KVM, the newest from sourceforge... I went by this howto, thats supposedly for edgy -- http://popey.com/Compiling_kvm_Under_Ubuntu_Edgy_i386
2007-01-16T12:41:00.000Z	jb0nd38372		oops
2007-01-16T12:41:00.000Z	jb0nd38372	n2diy	anyway,, I went to that how to... followed step by step.. and up until make, everything matched, then this happened -- http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/1789/
2007-01-16T12:43:00.000Z	n2diy	jb0nd38372	Ok, I don't like living on the edgy, so I'm still using Dapper, but let me go look at your paste now.

2007-01-16T12:44:00.000Z	n2diy		! kvm
2007-01-16T12:45:00.000Z	n2diy	jb0nd38372	what is kvm? looks like your trying to compile it?
2007-01-16T12:46:00.000Z	jb0nd38372	n2diy	KVM is just a port of qemu, virtulazation software to let me run a couple windows programs.. well run windows xp in linux, like  vmware except supposedly only faster
2007-01-16T12:47:00.000Z	jb0nd38372	n2diy	I have used vmware in the past.. compiled it, if you call running the installer script compiling.. anyway it worked albeit slow, I was hoping kvm might allow my xp session a little better hardware support, like xen offers
2007-01-16T12:48:00.000Z	jb0nd38372	n2diy	I think somehow, I do not have a needed lib, or header installed, but have no idea where to start to figure it out
2007-01-16T12:49:00.000Z	n2diy	jb0nd38372	ok, it looks like the problem is in lines 33-35,
2007-01-16T12:50:00.000Z	jb0nd38372	n2diy	/lib/modules/2.6.17-10-386 is there.. but there is no build folder in that tree at all
2007-01-16T12:50:00.000Z	n2diy	jb0nd38372	do you have "build-essnitals" installed?
2007-01-16T12:51:00.000Z	jb0nd38372	n2diy	I thought I did, I sudo apt-get , let me check package manager and see if it shows them installed
2007-01-16T12:51:00.000Z	n2diy		corretcion, jb0nd38372: do you have "build-essentials" installed?
2007-01-16T12:52:00.000Z	jb0nd38372	n2diy	yes, package manager says its installed... sorry about that, too many open windows at the moment lol
2007-01-16T12:54:00.000Z	jb0nd38372	n2diy	I think I may have found a solution... brb,
