2012-07-04T00:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U_bak	kosher	That sounds like a BIOS bug to me, though I'm not certain. Is your drive connected via SATA or PATA (IDE)?
2012-07-04T00:25:00.000Z	kosher	Jordan_U_bak	nnow I get no such device:  {long guid}
2012-07-04T00:25:00.000Z	kosher	Jordan_U_bak	this is the other drive I tried
2012-07-04T00:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U_bak	kosher	That makes sense, as sdb has a grub installation which is looking for the /boot/grub/ directory on sda (by UUID).
2012-07-04T00:27:00.000Z	kosher	Jordan_U_bak	should I try reinstalling with just this drive attached?
2012-07-04T00:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U_bak	kosher	Which drive, sda?
2012-07-04T00:27:00.000Z	kosher	Jordan_U_bak	the one that was SDB but now is the only drive
2012-07-04T00:28:00.000Z	kosher	Jordan_U_bak	will wiping all of the partitions clear out the grub stuff?
2012-07-04T00:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U_bak	kosher	Yes, that could be worth a try. I assumed that you wanted Ubuntu installed to what was sda (when you ran boot info script).
2012-07-04T00:30:00.000Z	kosher	Jordan_U_bak	originally, yes but it's ok.  I am going to try this other drive. It's installing now from my USB to the SDB, which is now SDA since it's the only drive.  Will let you know in a few moments :)
2012-07-04T00:33:00.000Z	kosher	Jordan_U_bak	ok install done, rebooting
2012-07-04T00:34:00.000Z	kosher	Jordan_U_bak	same issue but now it's back to the error about hd0
2012-07-04T00:35:00.000Z	kosher	Jordan_U_bak	hd0 cannot get c/h/s values
2012-07-04T00:35:00.000Z	kosher	Jordan_U_bak	could it be some driver issue?
2012-07-04T01:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U_bak	kosher	Super GRUB2 Disk beta, which is based on GRUB 2.00.
2012-07-04T01:37:00.000Z	kosher	Jordan_U_bak	excellent...
2012-07-04T01:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U_bak	kosher	I'm on a terrible connection at the moment, so I may drop out (and it's why I'm using two different nicks, one is my persistent client from my computer at home, the other is webchat from where I am now).
2012-07-04T01:39:00.000Z	kosher	Jordan_U_bak	no worries.  Is there a link I can grab it from, or do you have to build it up?
2012-07-04T01:39:00.000Z	kosher	Jordan_U_bak	in case your connection nukes and I have to bail, I am going to message you my email.
2012-07-04T01:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U_bak	kosher	http://jordanu.dyndns.org/tmp/super_grub2_disk_hybrid_2.00s1~git.iso First try the "List devices/partitions" option and tell me what happens (assuming that you get to a proper grub menu).
