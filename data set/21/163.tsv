2012-07-14T16:49:00.000Z	mankoff		Hi. Brand-new clean Ubuntu 12.04 install. How do I get 'nvidia-detector' to return something other than 'none'?
2012-07-14T16:49:00.000Z	mankoff		computer has GT-650M card...

2012-07-14T16:53:00.000Z	mankoff	Mattias	Ugh. Ok. I've been aware of this, but thought Nvidia supporte 650M. Maybe not. Is Bumble 64-bit? I tried that with another install, and got the impression it might be 32 bit only...
2012-07-14T16:54:00.000Z	Mattias	mankoff	no idea. try here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee
2012-07-14T16:57:00.000Z	Mattias	mankoff	you mean this? http://samiux.blogspot.se/2011/05/howto-nvidia-cuda-toolkit-40-on-ubuntu.html
2012-07-14T16:58:00.000Z	Mattias	mankoff	you might want both :) better battery life then
2012-07-14T16:58:00.000Z	mankoff	Mattias	I'll try that last link. Thanks. FYI I have this laptop: http://usa.asus.com/Notebooks/Multimedia_Entertainment/N56VZ/
2012-07-14T16:58:00.000Z	mankoff	Mattias	Not sure if that has the 2 levels you refer to.
2012-07-14T17:27:00.000Z	mankoff	Mattias	That link (http://samiux.blogspot.se/2011/05/howto-nvidia-cuda-toolkit-40-on-ubuntu.html) is for 11.04 and doesn't work for precise pangolin... :(.
2012-07-14T17:31:00.000Z	Mattias	mankoff	dunno, that was the link the 12.04 bumblebee page provided at the bottom
2012-07-14T17:35:00.000Z	Mattias	mankoff	What was it that didn't work?
2012-07-14T17:35:00.000Z	mankoff	Mattias	"W: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/aaron-haviland/cuda-4.0/ubuntu/dists/precise/main/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found"
2012-07-14T17:36:00.000Z	mankoff	Mattias	The "apt-get add-repository" line is this:  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:aaron-haviland/cuda-4.0
2012-07-14T17:36:00.000Z	mankoff	Mattias	But must tweak itself for my system, precise pangolin.
2012-07-14T17:37:00.000Z	Mattias	mankoff	http://d.hatena.ne.jp/iRiE/20120309/1331303439 for cuda 4.2
2012-07-14T17:40:00.000Z	Mattias	mankoff	but according to the japanese blog above, they got it installed
2012-07-14T17:40:00.000Z	mankoff	Mattias	OK I will try that. Also seems to be similar instructions here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtPAJ9BR1W8
2012-07-14T17:42:00.000Z	Mattias	mankoff	if you need anything translated I happen to know Japanese :P
2012-07-14T17:43:00.000Z	mankoff	Mattias	Ok thank you. I'll try with cut-and-paste and google, but will ask if I need more help.
2012-07-14T18:38:00.000Z	mankoff	Mattias	This page seems to be very similar to the japanese one: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Cuda And claims CUDA on 12.04. I followed the intsructions. Everything built, but the tests won't run...
