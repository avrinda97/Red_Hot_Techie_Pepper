2007-04-08T12:22:00.000Z	osofast	velko	hey buddy, thanks for all the help, as it turns out i had to put gid=114 and fstab=0002
2007-04-08T12:22:00.000Z	osofast	velko	fstab = 002 wouldnt work for some reason
2007-04-08T12:22:00.000Z	velko	osofast	cool. i'm glad it worked

2007-04-08T12:23:00.000Z	velko	osofast	np
2007-04-08T13:26:00.000Z	velko	osofast	could you post the fstab line please? and give some more detail about how it stopped working
2007-04-08T13:28:00.000Z	velko	osofast	i mean: did you mounted/unmounted the drive? manually/automatically? rebooted?
2007-04-08T13:30:00.000Z	velko	osofast	you mounted both times in the same manner? and got different results? if this is the case you have to file a bug
2007-04-08T13:31:00.000Z	velko	osofast	you can type vel[TAB]  to autocomplete nicks. so they won't be borked :-)

2007-04-08T13:31:00.000Z	osofast	velko	hey that works! sorry about the typo
2007-04-08T13:32:00.000Z	velko	osofast	np. just if you don't get the nick correctly i don't see your comment highlighted :-)
