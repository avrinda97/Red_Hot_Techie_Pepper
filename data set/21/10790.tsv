2009-11-20T22:57:00.000Z	coachz		are ubuntu people friendly ?  :-)
2009-11-20T22:57:00.000Z	maco	coachz	i think so, yes
2009-11-20T22:58:00.000Z	maco	coachz	i dont know whats in latest fedora. youd have to read release notes from both and compare
2009-11-20T23:07:00.000Z	maco	coachz	fedora is more aimed at bleeding edge, which sometimes requires fore-knowledge of linux
2009-11-20T23:08:00.000Z	maco	coachz	9.10 != 9.1  that wouldve been a january release ;) 9 = 2009, 10 = october
2009-11-20T23:08:00.000Z	maco	coachz	thats the education version
2009-11-20T23:10:00.000Z	maco	coachz	no reason to go 64 without 4gib ram
2009-11-20T23:11:00.000Z	maco	coachz	and pointers are bigger on 64bit so youll have higher memory usage
2009-11-20T23:11:00.000Z	maco	coachz	go for i386
2009-11-20T23:12:00.000Z	maco	coachz	http://torrent.ubuntu.com:6969/file?info_hash=%98%C5%C3a%D0%BE_%2A%07%EA%8F%A5%05.Z%A4%80%97%E7%F6
2009-11-20T23:12:00.000Z	coachz	maco	that's just a cd
2009-11-20T23:13:00.000Z	maco	coachz	ubuntu only requires one cd...
2009-11-23T00:29:00.000Z	maco	coachz	name it 1mydata?
2009-11-23T00:29:00.000Z	coachz	maco	that looks like crap
2009-11-24T23:37:00.000Z	maco	coachz	its the same format, but not the same toolchain
2009-11-24T23:37:00.000Z	maco	coachz	ie, we compile for different library versions than they do
2009-11-24T23:38:00.000Z	maco	coachz	so while you can take their source package and rebuild it locally into a binary package, taking their binary packages is not guaranteed to wokr
2009-11-24T23:39:00.000Z	maco	coachz	run "dget URL" where URL is the .dsc from that webpage
2009-11-24T23:39:00.000Z	coachz	maco	what does dget url do ?
2009-11-24T23:39:00.000Z	maco	coachz	dget downloads source packages.
2009-11-24T23:40:00.000Z	maco	coachz	can we go in PM so i can teach you there how to rebuild source packages?
