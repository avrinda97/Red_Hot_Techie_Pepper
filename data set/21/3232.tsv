2010-12-17T23:14:00.000Z	bryhoyt		anyone else? I'd like to be able to upgrade exim4 to version >= 4.70 on ubuntu 9.10 (the other day it was 8.10, but we're one step further now!), to avoid this vulnerability in exim4.69: http://www.exim.org/lurker/message/20101207.215955.bb32d4f2.en.html -- How can I do so?
2010-12-17T23:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	bryhoyt	wait until ubuntu fixes the bug and updates the package
2010-12-17T23:15:00.000Z	bryhoyt	erUSUL	I got hacked yesterday ;-) hence my impatience. But thanks for tip!
2010-12-17T23:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	bryhoyt	probably it has been already patched ( or maybe the bug does not affect the 9.10 version of exim )
2010-12-17T23:17:00.000Z	bryhoyt	erUSUL	that'd be nice. But I can't afford to risk it without knowing for sure. Any idea how/where to check for sure that a particular vulnerability's been fixed in a particular version of ubuntu?
2010-12-17T23:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	bryhoyt	checking

2010-12-17T23:20:00.000Z	bryhoyt	erUSUL	thanks, that's really helpful
2011-02-10T02:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	bryhoyt	i would go with udev rule
2011-02-10T02:37:00.000Z	bryhoyt	erUSUL	problem is, udev only runs a script on device insertion, but it's not mounted yet. Is there a nice way to run a rule after the device is fully mounted?
2011-02-10T02:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	bryhoyt	mount it in the script ? or wait until it is mounted...
2011-02-10T02:38:00.000Z	bryhoyt	erUSUL	the other problem is that udev waits for the script to complete before doing anything else -- it blocks the process, which is not what you want for a backup script. It also means that I can't make the script loop while waiting for the device to mount.
2011-02-10T02:40:00.000Z	bryhoyt	erUSUL	yeah, tried both. Mounting it in the script is a good idea, though I would like to leave Ubuntu's automount to do its job -- otherwise I have to go through the pain of creating a temporary folder for it etc etc. Ubuntu provides good functionality, so I feel like I shouldn't have to duplicate it.
2011-02-10T02:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	bryhoyt	udisk --mount /dev/blah 8 well the udev placeholder ) and it would be as if the systemmounted it automatically afaik
2011-02-10T02:41:00.000Z	bryhoyt	erUSUL	useful, thanks
2011-02-10T02:43:00.000Z	bryhoyt	erUSUL	how about the fact that udev blocks the rest of the process while waiting for my script to complete? That seems unhealthy to me. It's a python script, so no convenient way to background it, that I know of. And udev rules don't support "&" suffix to background a script.

2011-02-10T02:48:00.000Z	bryhoyt	erUSUL	very helpful link, thanks. Some good info on the different options, too. In fact, now I feel the need to ask my original question again -- looks like upstart & DBus aren't off the cards yet. Anyway, I'll go and do some further research, unless anyone has more opinions on udev vs upstart/DBus/DeviceKit at this point.
2011-02-10T02:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	bryhoyt	well i did not know upstart had the block-device-added event ;P
2011-02-10T02:51:00.000Z	bryhoyt	erUSUL	neither. You know more than me anyway ;-)
