2005-12-14T15:02:00.000Z	ubuntu_		hi, i need help with partitioning, i'm using the livecd right now. what i want to do is merge all partitions into one
2005-12-14T15:03:00.000Z	ubuntu_		bur[n] er, i ran that, i don't understand it
2005-12-14T15:03:00.000Z	ubuntu_		bur[n] er, hence why i needed help
2005-12-14T15:03:00.000Z	ubuntu_		bur[n] er, you're not helping?
2005-12-14T15:04:00.000Z	ubuntu_		it says i have /dev/hda1 and /dev/hda5, why do i have two?
2005-12-14T15:05:00.000Z	ubuntu_		bur[n] er, one is ext3 and the other is extended
2005-12-14T15:05:00.000Z	mycket	ubuntu_	did you repartiotion your hdd? Or do you have another OS on it?
2005-12-14T15:06:00.000Z	ubuntu_	mycket	i screwed up the partition while trying to install ubuntu
2005-12-14T15:06:00.000Z	ubuntu_		bur[n] er, it's 8GB
2005-12-14T15:06:00.000Z	ubuntu_		also, i have an "Unallocated" partition which is 20GB, what can i do with that?
2005-12-14T15:07:00.000Z	ubuntu_		bur[n] er, it doesn't say swap anywhere
2005-12-14T15:07:00.000Z	mycket	ubuntu_	you should create 2 partitions one ext3 or reiserfs for the system and one swap.
2005-12-14T15:08:00.000Z	ubuntu_		bur[n] er, the unallocated one says nothing, /dev/hda1/ says "extended"
2005-12-14T15:08:00.000Z	ubuntu_	mycket	i don't know how
2005-12-14T15:08:00.000Z	mycket	ubuntu_	if you want to install your system you can use the installproram to create these
2005-12-14T15:08:00.000Z	ubuntu_		bur[n] er, the partition name is unallocated
2005-12-14T15:09:00.000Z	ubuntu_		bur[n] er, of course, i was using it a minute ago
2005-12-14T15:09:00.000Z	ubuntu_		bur[n] er, it doesn't let me
2005-12-14T15:09:00.000Z	mycket	ubuntu_	do you have a live-cd or the install-cd? The install cd guides you throgh the install process
