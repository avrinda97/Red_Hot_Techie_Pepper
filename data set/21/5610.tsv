2007-09-15T16:05:00.000Z	scalawag		unperson -> in compizconfig settings manager
2007-09-15T16:06:00.000Z	scalawag		under "General Options" - > Third tab "Desktop Size"
2007-09-15T16:06:00.000Z	unperson	scalawag	Eh?  Sorry, where is that?  I'm not aware of such a thing.
2007-09-15T16:06:00.000Z	scalawag		in terminal type ccsm
2007-09-15T16:06:00.000Z	unperson	scalawag	I may be doing things "old school" based on when I tried compiz in edgy, when you had to just use gconf-editor.
2007-09-15T16:07:00.000Z	scalawag		Ahhhh...no idea in gconf-editor...
2007-09-15T16:07:00.000Z	scalawag		do you have ccsm installed?
2007-09-15T16:08:00.000Z	unperson	scalawag	ccsm exists in Feisty?  'which ccsm' and 'apt-cache search ccsm' both turn up nothing.
2007-09-15T16:08:00.000Z	scalawag		hmmmm....
2007-09-15T16:09:00.000Z	unperson	scalawag	Sorry, didn't see you question.  AFAIK I don't have it nor do I know where to get it.
2007-09-15T16:09:00.000Z	unperson	scalawag	I figured out the answer to my question, wrt to gconf.
2007-09-15T16:09:00.000Z	scalawag		good deal...
2007-09-15T16:09:00.000Z	unperson	scalawag	But I'll check into this ccsm, as a more user-friendly settings interface would be nice.
2007-09-15T16:10:00.000Z	scalawag	unperson	if you want it, just apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
2007-09-15T16:10:00.000Z	unperson	scalawag	Thanks.
2007-09-15T16:10:00.000Z	scalawag		it's quite friendly
2007-09-15T16:10:00.000Z	scalawag		...usually
2007-09-15T16:10:00.000Z	scalawag		:)
2007-09-15T16:10:00.000Z	unperson	scalawag	Heh.  Well, It's hard to be less friendly than gconf, which is a needle in a haystack.
2007-09-15T16:10:00.000Z	scalawag		lol, you got that right
2007-09-15T16:11:00.000Z	unperson	scalawag	It turns out that the setting for more workspaces is compiz->general->screen0->options->hsize.  Not exactly obvious.
