2007-05-20T08:17:00.000Z	purpzey		I am looking to add something to my autoload modules, what dir should I be echo-ing to?....The instructions I am reading say /etc/modules.autoload.d/kernel-2.6...I have no such directory.
2007-05-20T08:18:00.000Z	cafuego	purpzey	just put the module name in ?etc/modules
2007-05-20T08:42:00.000Z	cafuego	purpzey	grab the appropriate -dev package.
2007-05-20T08:43:00.000Z	purpzey	cafuego	I'm moderately new to all this I have almost no idea what that means....I am just trying to get the brightness controls going on my laptop...And need XOSD, so I can the install fsfn
2007-05-20T08:43:00.000Z	cafuego	purpzey	the panel brightness applet doesn't work?
2007-05-20T08:43:00.000Z	purpzey	cafuego	Where is this applet?
2007-05-20T08:44:00.000Z	cafuego	purpzey	Right click the panel, choose "Add to panel.."
2007-05-20T08:44:00.000Z	cafuego	purpzey	There's an lcd brightness thing in there.
2007-05-20T08:45:00.000Z	purpzey	cafuego	That applet doesn't do anything....I mean, the slider works, but beyond that
2007-05-20T08:45:00.000Z	cafuego	purpzey	hmm
2007-05-20T08:46:00.000Z	purpzey	cafuego	I found a thread on the forums that deal with this issue....Specifically for this make, I just can't seem to get the packages installed and configured
2007-05-20T08:46:00.000Z	cafuego	purpzey	you'll need libgtk2.somethingorother-dev I imagine.
2007-05-20T08:47:00.000Z	purpzey	cafuego	sudo apt get libgtk2. ? Or how can I find out what package I need/
2007-05-20T08:48:00.000Z	cafuego	purpzey	'apt-cache search gtk2' or search in synaptic.
2007-05-20T08:49:00.000Z	purpzey	cafuego	libgtk2.0-dev sound about right?
2007-05-20T08:49:00.000Z	cafuego	purpzey	does indeed
2007-05-20T08:50:00.000Z	purpzey	cafuego	so sudo apt-get libgtk2.0-dev ...Then beyond that do I need to compile it or anything?
2007-05-20T08:50:00.000Z	cafuego	purpzey	No, that will fix the ./configure problem you posted earlier.
2007-05-20T08:51:00.000Z	purpzey	cafuego	great thankd
2007-05-20T08:51:00.000Z	cafuego	purpzey	For any other ./configure issues, rinse & repeat ;-)
2007-05-20T08:54:00.000Z	purpzey	cafuego	I think I am just being stupid somehow...I am running "sudo apt-get libgtk2.0-dev" and being returned "Invalid Operation libgtk2.0-dev"
