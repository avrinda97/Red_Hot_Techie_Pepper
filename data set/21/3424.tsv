2009-01-30T07:09:00.000Z	jp_sf	tabidachi_	you will have to convert them, but you could try opentype font were developed by Microsoft and Adobe not the most open source friendly companies in the world
2009-01-30T07:09:00.000Z	jp_sf	tabidachi_	you will have to convert them, but you could try to install them

2009-01-30T07:10:00.000Z	jp_sf	tabidachi_	I understand but I would try to install them in /usr/share/fonts and and then update the fontdatabase

2009-01-30T07:12:00.000Z	jp_sf	tabidachi_	I don't have those fonts but you could tryto install them make a directory in /usr/share/fonts/type1
2009-01-30T07:13:00.000Z	jp_sf	tabidachi_	copy them in a directory otf like sudo mkdir /usr/share/fonts/type1/otf
