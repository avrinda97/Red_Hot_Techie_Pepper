2010-05-18T16:55:00.000Z	Onepamopa		hi all
2010-05-18T16:56:00.000Z	Onepamopa		I'm using ubuntu server 10.04 lts
2010-05-18T16:56:00.000Z	Onepamopa		and I have 2-3 questions
2010-05-18T16:56:00.000Z	Onepamopa		how so?
2010-05-18T16:57:00.000Z	Onepamopa		I'm wondering, will it be okay to disable swap completely, I use 16 gb ddr3 ecc + 2 xeons
2010-05-18T16:57:00.000Z	Onepamopa		and.. as strange as it may sound.... something is writing in the swap ..
2010-05-18T16:57:00.000Z	Onepamopa		and I want to avoid that
2010-05-18T16:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Onepamopa	 you proberly could. I always leave 512mb of swap on every hd just in case.
2010-05-18T16:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Onepamopa	 a year or 3 ago ther ewas a big artical about using swap partitions or not.
2010-05-18T16:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Onepamopa	 is it really causing an issue?
2010-05-18T17:01:00.000Z	Onepamopa	Dr_Willis	well, swap's here for a reason, so if I disable it ... this can cause some issue when there's no memory free
2010-05-18T17:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Onepamopa	 if you are using 16gb of ram.. well...
2010-05-18T17:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Onepamopa	 be interesting to see what is using the swap over the cache ram.
2010-05-18T17:03:00.000Z	Onepamopa	Dr_Willis	sure...
2010-05-18T17:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Onepamopa	 could be a badly programed app.
2010-05-18T17:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Onepamopa	 and what are you going to do with a ramdisk>
2010-05-18T17:10:00.000Z	Onepamopa	Dr_Willis	disable swap and use ramdisk instead
2010-05-18T17:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Onepamopa	 i dont see what you  will really gain by that.. You going to put your swap on the ramdisk>
2010-05-18T17:11:00.000Z	Onepamopa	Dr_Willis	my swap usage isnt high, it's around 200-300 mb max
2010-05-18T17:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Onepamopa	 have you even proven its the java server thats using the swap?   You may want to file a bug on the java server if you can prove thats teh case
2010-05-18T17:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Onepamopa	 you could make it any size and put a swap file on it. instead of making it a swap partition.  then  again. I thought there was some tempfs (in ram) allready you could just make a swap file in..
