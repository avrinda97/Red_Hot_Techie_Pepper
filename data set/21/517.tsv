2011-11-11T03:51:00.000Z	arsenic		I have an issue with my tv tuner card-
2011-11-11T03:53:00.000Z	arsenic		can u read me? :S
2011-11-11T03:54:00.000Z	arsenic		How can I install my Genius tvgo a11mce on ubuntu 10.10?
2011-11-11T03:56:00.000Z	arsenic		:/

2011-11-11T03:58:00.000Z	arsenic	tdowg1	I see... so that card is not working on linux yet?
2011-11-11T03:59:00.000Z	tdowg1	arsenic	well, idk... im perusing their site now... what have you found out thus far about the card?  what do you know that i probably dont know (which is totally nothing btw)?
2011-11-11T04:00:00.000Z	tdowg1	arsenic	nothing is coming up atm that I can see.  for the TVGo A12, they have OS Support as all Windows crap.  I might email them and see if they have support for the card, and if not, if and when they expect to put out some drivers?
2011-11-11T04:01:00.000Z	arsenic	tdowg1	when I do a lspci command on a terminal I get that:
2011-11-11T04:02:00.000Z	tdowg1	arsenic	so your system def sees it.  but my guess is that it doesn't know what to do with it?  im not sure i def dont have experience with this.
2011-11-11T04:02:00.000Z	tdowg1	arsenic	something I might try as a last ditch effort would to be to boot up the latest knoppix live cd... knoppix seems to do some pretty badd azz things that a regular default ubuntu 10.10 probably wont do.  so you can see if you can do aynthing using the knoppix os?
2011-11-11T04:07:00.000Z	tdowg1	arsenic	ya what significance does this have?  not even same model or close to it.
2011-11-11T04:12:00.000Z	arsenic	tdowg1	and I have tv time, but it closes before starting...
2011-11-11T04:15:00.000Z	tdowg1	arsenic	ya idk what to tell you buddy.  i would just try knoppix live cd.  if not, there's a bunch of live linux operating systems that specialize in being media center pc's  / home theater pc's.  you might try one of them.  but it might not matter in any case--like what blz said: youll need drivers of some sort to get that particular card to work.
2011-11-11T04:15:00.000Z	tdowg1	arsenic	oh ya, and email the company.  bug them.
2011-11-11T04:16:00.000Z	tdowg1	arsenic	you bought they card, they owe you that much.
2011-11-11T04:16:00.000Z	arsenic	tdowg1	yeah, I will
2011-11-11T04:17:00.000Z	arsenic	tdowg1	that is working on tuquito linux
