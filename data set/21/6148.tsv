2007-05-25T12:09:00.000Z	TinoW		Q: what is the state of the art method to adjust screen resolution with ubuntu xorg?
2007-05-25T12:09:00.000Z	PurpZeY	TinoW	Whatever you do, back up xorg.conf first
2007-05-25T12:10:00.000Z	TinoW	PurpZeY	I mean I know about xorg.conf and stuff but how is joe user supposed to do that?
2007-05-25T12:11:00.000Z	PurpZeY	TinoW	To back it up, or to change the res?
2007-05-25T12:11:00.000Z	TinoW	PurpZeY	actually both :-)
2007-05-25T12:11:00.000Z	TinoW	PurpZeY	I learned that ubuntu as well as debian even dropped xorgcfg w/o replacement :(
2007-05-25T12:12:00.000Z	PurpZeY	TinoW	To back it up 'cp /etc/x11/xorg.conf <name of backup...e.g. xorg.bak>
2007-05-25T12:13:00.000Z	TinoW	PurpZeY	yes I know that - again joe user... ok, how does this back up the internal recordings of the configuration utility?
2007-05-25T12:14:00.000Z	TinoW	PurpZeY	what comes next? :-)
2007-05-25T12:15:00.000Z	PurpZeY	TinoW	There is a xorg log.
2007-05-25T12:15:00.000Z	PurpZeY	TinoW	Next in xorg...under monitor Mode to "1024 x 768" or whatever you wanted.
2007-05-25T12:16:00.000Z	TinoW	PurpZeY	no, the xorg log does only log the start messaged about config and detection and stuff. If you use dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg ( I mean, you just know such stuff as joe user ;) it records your input somewhere too - so when you copy back your xorg.conf the selections next time you run depend on your last run
2007-05-25T12:17:00.000Z	PurpZeY	TinoW	I am joe user. I'm not even sure what you're asking anymore.
2007-05-25T12:18:00.000Z	TinoW	PurpZeY	how to easy and understandable configure a different screen resolution (or the correct resolution) :-)
2007-05-25T12:18:00.000Z	PurpZeY	TinoW	Notwithstanding that I don't know much, I only know the hard way. I don't even know if there is a way to do it using the gui.
2007-05-25T12:19:00.000Z	TinoW	PurpZeY	that is no good... so what is your hard way to do it?
2007-05-25T12:20:00.000Z	PurpZeY	TinoW	The way I just told you...Edit mode in xorg under monitors.
2007-05-25T12:20:00.000Z	TinoW	PurpZeY	yuck... that is even harder ;))
2007-05-25T12:21:00.000Z	PurpZeY	TinoW	I think you are having me walk you in circles, seems like there might be someone more versed to help you.
2007-05-25T12:30:00.000Z	TinoW	PurpZeY	thanks for sharing your thoughts anyway :-)
