2009-09-21T02:27:00.000Z	indicava		I have two computers hooked up to the same router, the router is connected to the internet, I want computer A to access the internet through the router but Computer B to use computer A as its GW to the internet, possible?
2009-09-21T02:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	indicava	you could install squid on computer A then set it as the web proxy for B
2009-09-21T02:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	indicava	then you'll need to setup computer A as a router and have another NIC in computer A, this will make your hardware router obsolete
2009-09-21T02:32:00.000Z	indicava	ActionParsnip	its impossible to setup with one NIC on comp. A ?
2009-09-21T02:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	indicava	not wihout applying setting settings to computer B
2009-09-21T02:33:00.000Z	indicava	ActionParsnip	what would I need to set on comp. B? is it something I can set via the DHCP server on A?
2009-09-21T02:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	indicava	you'd need to setup the default gateway as the IP of computer A, then setup computer A with 2 interfaces on the single NIC to manage switching
2009-09-21T02:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	indicava	it'll get messy but is possible
2009-09-21T02:35:00.000Z	indicava	ActionParsnip	i'm not scared of messy ;_ any links to some howto's online you know?
2009-09-21T02:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	indicava	you'll need to specify a VLAN for the 2 systems with a seperate addressing regime
2009-09-21T02:38:00.000Z	indicava	ActionParsnip	i figured that out already, I tried adding a vritual device in /etc/network/interfaces like etho0:1 with a different addressing scheme, but it couldn't bring it up for some reasonm can't assign address or something
2009-09-21T02:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	indicava	you need to set it to a static IP as the device will not be connected logically to the router
2009-09-21T02:39:00.000Z	indicava	ActionParsnip	I did, can I send you the interfaces file somehow ? paste it here ?
2009-09-21T02:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	indicava	thats the idea
2009-09-21T02:43:00.000Z	indicava	ActionParsnip	nevermind its commented out, I rolled it back but this is the idea: http://paste.ubuntu.com/274906/
2009-09-21T02:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	indicava	i think you should check the !ics guide
2009-09-21T02:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	indicava	you are on the right lines but its just the finer points you need to iron out
2009-09-21T02:45:00.000Z	indicava	ActionParsnip	I guess thats reassuring, altho its those fine lines I was hoping to iron out here ;)
2009-09-21T02:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	indicava	looks ok, I think you may have to change your netmask to 255.255.0.0 and have a 192.168.0.x network and a 192.168.1.x network
2009-09-21T02:47:00.000Z	indicava	ActionParsnip	interesting, will check it out
2009-09-21T02:47:00.000Z	indicava	ActionParsnip	BTW, you aren't really one person acknowledging all those questions at once right ? heh
