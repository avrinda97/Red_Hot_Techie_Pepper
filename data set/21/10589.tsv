2005-12-08T09:30:00.000Z	jackmacokc	pantz	i think you are using xorg..you sure you arent? or did you just not see any results after changing it?

2005-12-08T09:31:00.000Z	jackmacokc	pantz	not sure..assuming you write the changes, you should be able to reboot and get that res
2005-12-08T09:32:00.000Z	jackmacokc	pantz	its been my experience you have to restart completely to get resolution changes to take

2005-12-08T09:38:00.000Z	pantz	jackmacokc	maybe i should install the nvidia drivers
2005-12-08T09:39:00.000Z	jackmacokc	pantz	hah..yeah that might help. might not support that resolution natively
