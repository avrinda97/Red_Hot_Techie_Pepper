2011-12-06T19:41:00.000Z	ok2cqr		hello, does ahnybody have experience with ipv6 on Ubuntu 10.04 server, please? IPV6 is working but after few minutes it stops and works again after /etc/init.d/networking restart
2011-12-06T19:41:00.000Z	Gentoo64	ok2cqr	try #ipv6
2011-12-06T19:42:00.000Z	ok2cqr	Gentoo64	No, I wrote settings directly to interfaces file
2011-12-06T19:44:00.000Z	Gentoo64	ok2cqr	have you tried it with autonconf see if it still cutso ut?
2011-12-06T19:45:00.000Z	ok2cqr	Gentoo64	No I have not. I'm not sure how to use autoconf.
2011-12-06T19:45:00.000Z	Gentoo64	ok2cqr	it was that by default
2011-12-06T19:46:00.000Z	Gentoo64	ok2cqr	id ask in #ipv6 as theyd know more then in here
2011-12-06T19:46:00.000Z	ok2cqr	Gentoo64	but how to tell the ip address to eth0 interface? With ifconfig?
2011-12-06T19:46:00.000Z	ok2cqr	Gentoo64	Thank you, I'll try it.
2011-12-06T20:01:00.000Z	ok2cqr	Gentoo64	I just looked at dmesg and see eth0: no IPv6 routers present but ping6 to ipv6.google.com works
2011-12-06T20:01:00.000Z	Gentoo64	ok2cqr	thats normall message
2011-12-06T20:04:00.000Z	Gentoo64	ok2cqr	keep a tail -f /var/log/messages (or similar) open see if it says anything when it cuts off
2011-12-06T20:06:00.000Z	ok2cqr	Gentoo64	nothing was added
2011-12-06T20:07:00.000Z	ok2cqr	Gentoo64	yes, ipv4 is still working
2011-12-06T20:08:00.000Z	Gentoo64	ok2cqr	hmm weird
2011-12-06T20:08:00.000Z	Gentoo64	ok2cqr	paste /etc/network/interfaces?
2011-12-06T20:08:00.000Z	Gentoo64	ok2cqr	i probably cant help tho
2011-12-06T20:08:00.000Z	ok2cqr	Gentoo64	it seems that it iw working only if I leave ping6 ipv6.google.com running. After I terminate it, the connection is gone in a few seconds.
2011-12-06T20:09:00.000Z	Gentoo64	ok2cqr	ahh
2011-12-06T20:09:00.000Z	Gentoo64	ok2cqr	make sure ipv6 ping is enabled on ur box
2011-12-06T20:10:00.000Z	ok2cqr	Gentoo64	I have native connection.
