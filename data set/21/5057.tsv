2008-01-26T20:22:00.000Z	xomp		!dd
2008-01-26T20:22:00.000Z	xomp		thanks nickrud
2008-01-26T20:23:00.000Z	LjL	xomp	nickrud: it's in coreutils
2008-01-26T20:23:00.000Z	xomp	LjL	cool, so I will be able then to backup my install?
2008-01-26T20:24:00.000Z	LjL	xomp	eh, i don't know... i just know ubuntu definitely comes with dd
2008-04-29T19:24:00.000Z	LjL	xomp	what version of Ubuntu are you on?
2008-04-29T19:24:00.000Z	xomp	LjL	Gutsy
2008-04-29T19:26:00.000Z	xomp	LjL	I cd'd into /lib/firmware/2.6.22.14-generic so I know it's there. I think the "cp" command is incorrect but don't know much about linux to figure it out on my own.
2008-04-29T19:27:00.000Z	LjL	xomp	the "cd" command is fine, if the directory exists...
2008-04-29T19:28:00.000Z	xomp	LjL	I'm currently sitting in my home directory issuing that cp command. If I go back to root, then lib, and so on the directory I'm trying to copy too exists.
2008-04-29T19:29:00.000Z	LjL	xomp	i understand, however i can guarantee you that the command itself is fine... (i just tried it, too)
2008-04-29T19:30:00.000Z	xomp	LjL	I see my error lol. It's 2.6.22-14, not 2.6.22.14 :)
2008-04-29T19:30:00.000Z	LjL	xomp	it indeed is
2008-10-06T22:59:00.000Z	LjL	xomp	err... why would you want to *merge*, if one of the partitions is unallocated? (besides, if it's unallocated it's not a partition). "delete" the unallocated one, then enlarge the other.
2008-10-06T23:00:00.000Z	LjL	xomp	then you just enlarge the allocated one
2008-10-06T23:01:00.000Z	LjL	xomp	what filesystem is it?
2008-10-06T23:03:00.000Z	LjL	xomp	uhm, fat32 should be easily resizeable, it's weird. it's not mounted, is it?
2008-10-27T03:20:00.000Z	LjL	xomp	aptitude is not KDE's package manager. that's complete nonsense.
2008-10-27T03:21:00.000Z	xomp	LjL	ah that's right, it was Adept.
2010-06-02T18:07:00.000Z	LjL	xomp	well, i guess something like   if ! pidof name-of-executable >/dev/null; then name-of-executable; fi
2010-06-02T18:28:00.000Z	LjL	xomp	that it gets restarted continuously if it keeps crashing, and that if you put that into a crontab, it won't check whether it's already running so it'll keep restarting (in other words, that's not to be put in a crontab)
