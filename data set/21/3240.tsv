2009-11-07T05:29:00.000Z	underdog7	Tartaros	what is the equivalent of the "device manager" in windows to ubuntu?
2009-11-07T05:27:00.000Z	Tartaros	underdog7	 touchpad is a known regression
2009-11-07T05:27:00.000Z	Tartaros	underdog7	especially middle button and scrolling. You'll probably have to wait for the fix
2009-11-07T05:27:00.000Z	underdog7	Tartaros	u mean, it's knownnot to work?
2009-11-07T05:28:00.000Z	Tartaros	underdog7	regression = it used to work in previous distro, but it doesn't anymore. So yeah.
2009-11-07T05:28:00.000Z	underdog7	Tartaros	do u think regenerating the xorg.config might help?
2009-11-07T05:29:00.000Z	Tartaros	underdog7	I doubt that but it probably can't harm :)
2009-11-07T05:30:00.000Z	Tartaros	underdog7	I don't think there's any
2009-11-07T05:30:00.000Z	underdog7	Tartaros	thx.  will try 2 regenerate.  any other ideas btw?
2009-11-07T05:30:00.000Z	Tartaros	underdog7	there isn't much to really manage about devices in ubuntu, usually they just work or they don't :P
2009-11-07T05:31:00.000Z	Tartaros	underdog7	what you configure then are the applications that use them
2009-11-07T05:36:00.000Z	underdog7	Tartaros	is there anyway 2 revert to 9.04?
2009-11-07T05:37:00.000Z	Tartaros	underdog7	I don't think so
2009-11-07T05:38:00.000Z	underdog7	Tartaros	it worked!!!! regenerating (even though it didn't show any dialogs) got my mousepad 2 work!!!
2009-11-07T05:38:00.000Z	Tartaros	underdog7	middle button works?
2009-11-07T05:38:00.000Z	underdog7	Tartaros	my touchpad doesn't have a middle button
2009-11-07T05:39:00.000Z	underdog7	Tartaros	but if i plug in my external mouse, the middle button works -- not sure if that makes ne diff
2009-11-07T05:40:00.000Z	Tartaros	underdog7	well if you install xsynaptic (touchpad setting), or even in the normal mouse settings, you can set middle button emulation. Like 2 fingers at once or left+right button at once, or something. And that's what doesn't work for many people :)
2009-11-07T05:40:00.000Z	underdog7	Tartaros	i thought xsynaptic became obsolete w/ ubuntu?
2009-11-07T05:41:00.000Z	Tartaros	underdog7	yeah well with it or without it, it doesnt work :)
2009-11-07T05:42:00.000Z	underdog7	Tartaros	lol.  gotcha.  anyway, thx 4 ur help.
