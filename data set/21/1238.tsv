2010-12-15T15:32:00.000Z	twitch	tokyomission	the update hasn't finbshed if it errored .. so if you know how to use ps aux .. kill all processes attached to apt .. or just reboot then try apt-get install -f
2010-12-15T15:32:00.000Z	tokyomission		I can do ctrl-c but it says"This will abort the operation and may leave the system in a broken state."
2010-12-15T15:34:00.000Z	twitch	tokyomission	it's already going to be a broken state if the packages you are trying to install have failed half way through
