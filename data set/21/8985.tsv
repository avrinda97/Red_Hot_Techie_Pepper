2005-12-08T14:58:00.000Z	drumline		fools...  It's not hard to get linux support; release the spec and somebody will write a driver.
2005-12-08T14:58:00.000Z	drumline		owner: does it have a network port?
2005-12-08T14:59:00.000Z	Madpilot	drumline	yeah, or in HP's case: sponser a sourceforge project for your stuff...
2005-12-08T14:59:00.000Z	drumline	Madpilot	very very smart move.
2005-12-08T15:00:00.000Z	Madpilot	drumline	I gather that even HP's all-in-one units - printer+scanner - work in Linux now...
2005-12-09T16:29:00.000Z	Madpilot	drumline	use Synaptic and search for mplayer - there's lots of versions...
2005-12-09T16:35:00.000Z	Madpilot	drumline	I just searched Synaptic, there's six or eight mplayer packages
2005-12-09T16:36:00.000Z	drumline	Madpilot	we must have differing sources in the apt conf.
2005-12-09T16:36:00.000Z	Madpilot	drumline	do you have Universe & Multiverse enabled?
2005-12-09T16:36:00.000Z	drumline	Madpilot	yes. I have everything enabled.
2005-12-09T16:37:00.000Z	Madpilot	drumline	& pppoe_dude: search for mplayer here: http://packages.ubuntu.com/
2005-12-09T16:39:00.000Z	drumline	Madpilot	hmm...  weird...  that must be a different repo that it's searching.
2005-12-09T16:39:00.000Z	Madpilot	drumline	check the msg ubotu sent you a while ago, and double-check your sources.list against it
2005-12-09T16:47:00.000Z	drumline	Madpilot	yikes... I was missing a few...   Yet, synaptic whines about those lines...   *shrug*
2005-12-09T16:50:00.000Z	Madpilot	drumline	you're running 5.10 (Breezy), right?
2005-12-09T16:53:00.000Z	drumline	Madpilot	aha!   I was missing one of those that were in the pastebin..
2005-12-09T16:53:00.000Z	drumline	Madpilot	i guess Ubuntu can't provide a link to that repo in the distro?
2005-12-09T16:53:00.000Z	Madpilot	drumline	which repo?
2005-12-09T16:54:00.000Z	Madpilot	drumline	likely Multiverse - that's where all or most of the mplayer stuff is
2005-12-09T16:55:00.000Z	drumline	Madpilot	all of my repos have us.archive.ubuntu...   you think the us.archive makes a difference?
2005-12-09T16:55:00.000Z	Madpilot	drumline	the us archive seems to have more trouble than the rest, for some reason. aside from that, it's identical, AFAIK
