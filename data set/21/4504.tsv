2008-09-29T19:38:00.000Z	CartoonCat		Hello all
2008-09-29T19:39:00.000Z	CartoonCat		I need some help performng some Evil
2008-09-29T19:39:00.000Z	CartoonCat		Ive got a box with both a ATi and nVidia card in it
2008-09-29T19:39:00.000Z	CartoonCat		I want 3 display devices but so far, can not get the ati drivers to paly nice with the nvidias
2008-09-29T19:40:00.000Z	ikonia	CartoonCat	mixing like that can be quite problematic
2008-09-29T19:42:00.000Z	CartoonCat	ikonia	I am seeing that. But, unless I can get 3d rendering working on the ATi, I need the nvidia cause it works
2008-09-29T19:42:00.000Z	ikonia	CartoonCat	what method are you using for the X servers, 3 seperate ones ?
2008-09-29T19:45:00.000Z	CartoonCat	ikonia	no, will i need to? I started with trying to get the ATi to work (its onboard 9100 with compisite out) using XRander
2008-09-29T19:45:00.000Z	ikonia	CartoonCat	one of the big limitations I had was loading multiple drivers into xorg, the way I got around with was to launch 2 xservers, one with ati, one with nvidia, then link them all with xinerama
2008-09-29T19:46:00.000Z	CartoonCat	ikonia	ah crapolies, that will make my wine get very upset i think, plus the overhead of 2x X servers,
2008-09-29T19:47:00.000Z	ikonia	CartoonCat	I don't think it will cause wine issues, but there may be issues dragging it from the nvidia-> ati screen, I don't know to be honest
2008-09-29T19:50:00.000Z	CartoonCat	ikonia	could you look at the ubuntu binary ati driver page and help me parse this, It says is a radeon (yup) is a 9xxx above 9500 (no) OR is X300 series (nope, R200) OR has TV out (Yup) . To me, that reads it will work.
2008-09-29T19:51:00.000Z	ikonia	CartoonCat	sorry, not sure I follow your question
2008-09-29T19:51:00.000Z	CartoonCat	ikonia	the binary ati driver requirements here : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI
2008-09-29T19:52:00.000Z	ikonia	CartoonCat	yes, I got that, whats the issue ?
2008-09-29T19:53:00.000Z	ikonia	CartoonCat	ati or radoen driver ?
2008-09-29T19:53:00.000Z	ikonia	CartoonCat	log in and edit it
2008-09-29T19:54:00.000Z	CartoonCat	ikonia	i woudl but first I want ot be <sure> that its 9500 AND X300 or tv-out
2008-09-29T19:54:00.000Z	ikonia	CartoonCat	I'm terrible with ati
2008-09-29T19:54:00.000Z	CartoonCat	ikonia	i seam to be also lol
2008-09-29T19:55:00.000Z	ikonia	CartoonCat	#ati and #nvidia
