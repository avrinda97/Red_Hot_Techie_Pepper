2006-05-31T16:35:00.000Z	Noah0504		Hey, I was just wondering what people thought.  I want to get back into programming.  Do you think I should learn C/C++ or something like Python?
2006-05-31T16:36:00.000Z	Chousuke	Noah0504	learn both. :P
2006-05-31T16:36:00.000Z	Chousuke	Noah0504	You could start with Python though.
2006-05-31T16:36:00.000Z	Noah0504	Chousuke	hehe, Okay, that second answer was what I was looking for!
2006-05-31T16:37:00.000Z	Chousuke	Noah0504	though if you learn python first, C++ will be pretty painful :D
2006-05-31T16:37:00.000Z	Chousuke		But I think you should know both.
2006-05-31T16:37:00.000Z	Noah0504	Chousuke	Hmm...
2006-05-31T16:38:00.000Z	Noah0504	Chousuke	Well, if I wanted to maybe pick back up on C++ (I learned a little C a few years ago), what would I need to get started?  Are there any packages I need to install?
2006-05-31T16:38:00.000Z	Chousuke	Noah0504	python is an easy-to-understand language, but it has several nice things that C++ lacks, and if you try to learn C++ after python, you'll probably have at least some trouble coping with the lacking niceties. :)
2006-05-31T16:39:00.000Z	Chousuke	Noah0504	gcc/g++
2006-05-31T16:39:00.000Z	Noah0504	Chousuke	...and I don't think I need to install anything for Python -- am I right?
2006-05-31T16:39:00.000Z	Chousuke	Noah0504	if you already know some C, then it should be easier.
2006-05-31T16:39:00.000Z	Chousuke	Noah0504	well, the python interpreter. but that comes by default :)
2006-05-31T16:39:00.000Z	Noah0504	Chousuke	hehe, But that was a few years ago, and I really don't remember too much!
2006-05-31T16:40:00.000Z	Noah0504		Are there a lot of Python driven projects around?  What's the more popular language?
2006-05-31T16:40:00.000Z	Chousuke	Noah0504	anyway, for python docs and tutorials, python.org is sufficient. :)
2006-05-31T16:41:00.000Z	Noah0504	Chousuke	Thanks, I'll check them out!  :)
2006-05-31T16:41:00.000Z	Chousuke	Noah0504	python and C++ are both popular
2006-05-31T16:41:00.000Z	Chousuke	Noah0504	C++ is faster than python, since python is an interpreted language.
2006-05-31T16:42:00.000Z	Chousuke	Noah0504	but C++ is also more complicated and lower-level
2006-05-31T16:42:00.000Z	Noah0504	Chousuke	Well, I think I may do a little reading before I decide on which one I'll at least start with.  Thanks for all you help!
