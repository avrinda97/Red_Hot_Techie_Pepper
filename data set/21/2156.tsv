2011-03-25T23:42:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	Rogerr	alias
2011-03-25T23:42:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	Rogerr	add it to the .bashrc
2011-03-25T23:43:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	Rogerr	nano ~/.bashrc
2011-03-25T23:45:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	Rogerr	alias may look like: " alias easyfind='find . | grep -i -s -e ' " <- without double quotes
2011-03-25T23:46:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	Rogerr	yes
2011-03-25T23:47:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	Rogerr	after you write your alias and save the new .bashrc, you may want to "restart" it, the command is: . ~/.bashrc
2011-03-25T23:51:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	Rogerr	after you write your alias and save the new .bashrc, you may want to "restart" it, the command is: . ~/.bashrc
2011-03-25T23:54:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	Rogerr	i never told you to edit root .bashrc
2011-03-25T23:54:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	Rogerr	'whoami'
2011-03-25T23:54:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	Rogerr	returns what?
2011-03-25T23:57:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	Rogerr	use my nick (or the nick of the person you are addressing), type few letters and a tab
2011-03-25T23:58:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	Rogerr	no idea why would you get permission denied on user based files
2011-03-25T23:59:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	Rogerr	after you write your alias and save the new .bashrc, you may want to "restart" it, the command is: . ~/.bashrc < - this is the 3rd time i paste this
2011-03-26T00:02:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	Rogerr	would your command work when run directly ?
