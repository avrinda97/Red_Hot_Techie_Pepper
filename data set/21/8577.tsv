2006-03-13T16:08:00.000Z	FoamY_LappY		anyone in here running an ibm thinkpad with ubuntu on it?
2006-03-13T16:10:00.000Z	FoamY_LappY		well the 2 things that don't seem right are when linux and ubuntu boot the screen flickers and the other thing is that the little mouse button on the thinkpad is way way glitchy sometimes
2006-03-13T16:10:00.000Z	FoamY_LappY		it will randomly start clicking on things and going around the desktop on it's own
2006-03-13T16:10:00.000Z	FoamY_LappY		and i don't know if it's a driver issue or not
2006-03-13T16:11:00.000Z	FoamY_LappY		lol
2006-03-13T16:12:00.000Z	Agent_bob	FoamY_LappY	in the 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg '  the question is asked  "what mouse protocal"  read all of that and choose the correct protocal.
2006-03-13T16:13:00.000Z	Agent_bob	FoamY_LappY	don't jump on "autops2"  because it obviously doesn't work for you.
2006-03-13T16:14:00.000Z	Agent_bob		if at first you don't succeed keep on sucken
2006-03-13T16:15:00.000Z	FoamY_LappY	Agent_bob	ok how do i do that this is my first lappy so i am kinda new to this type of thing
2006-03-13T16:15:00.000Z	Agent_bob		you type that in the terminal
2006-03-13T16:16:00.000Z	Agent_bob	FoamY_LappY	   sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2006-03-13T16:16:00.000Z	FoamY_LappY		oh ok i know how to do that and just make sure that the autops2 thing is disabled?
2006-03-13T16:16:00.000Z	FoamY_LappY		and i should have no issues then
2006-03-13T16:16:00.000Z	FoamY_LappY		yay ^_^
2006-03-13T16:17:00.000Z	Agent_bob	FoamY_LappY	it will make a backup copy of the /etc/X11/xorg.conf   as xorg.conf*******   where ***** is time stamped
2006-03-13T16:18:00.000Z	FoamY_LappY		right i know i have used the reconfig option before i just diden't know if that would fix the issue ^_^
2006-03-13T16:18:00.000Z	Agent_bob	FoamY_LappY	no just make sure you choose the mouse protocal that is correct for you system....   i.e.  imps2  maybe
2006-03-13T16:18:00.000Z	FoamY_LappY		so after i install the remainder of the things i am doing
2006-03-13T16:18:00.000Z	FoamY_LappY		ok i will try
2006-03-13T16:20:00.000Z	Agent_bob	FoamY_LappY	again,  i read slow and type slow.  so my answers maybe several linse behind the qusetion.
