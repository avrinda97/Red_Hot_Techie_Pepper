2008-02-28T00:03:00.000Z	MasterShrak	wolfman2323	how did you install your nvidia drivers originally?
2008-02-28T00:05:00.000Z	MasterShrak	wolfman2323	so you havent installed nvidia drivers? even before it was broken?
2008-02-28T00:07:00.000Z	MasterShrak	wolfman2323	try: sudo dpkg-reconfigure nvidia-glx-new
2008-02-28T00:07:00.000Z	MasterShrak	wolfman2323	if that throws and error at you do: sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-new
2008-02-28T00:09:00.000Z	MasterShrak	wolfman2323	all you had to do was tell me that it isnt installed, use that second command i gave you
2008-02-28T00:12:00.000Z	wolfman2323	MasterShrak	after that.. vids.. will work??
2008-02-28T00:13:00.000Z	MasterShrak	wolfman2323	sorry but i was unaware that you were having problems with videos, i followed your link earlier and assumed it was a problem with your nvidia card, this should help tho for vids although you may need some codecs and stuff
2008-02-28T00:14:00.000Z	wolfman2323	MasterShrak	what had happened is that.. after i updated ubuntu... suddenly videos doesnt work anymoere.. even flash..
2008-02-28T00:15:00.000Z	MasterShrak	wolfman2323	interesting, that post on the forums has nothign to do with that though. are you running gutsy? (7.10)
2008-02-28T00:16:00.000Z	MasterShrak	wolfman2323	have you added the medibuntu repositories?
2008-02-28T00:17:00.000Z	MasterShrak	wolfman2323	youll have to restart your xserver so the changes will take effect (ctrl+alt+backspace) and log back in
2008-02-28T00:18:00.000Z	MasterShrak	wolfman2323	grats
2008-02-28T00:21:00.000Z	MasterShrak	wolfman2323	what player are you using for your videos?
2008-02-28T00:23:00.000Z	MasterShrak	wolfman2323	i would suggest trying a different player, ive never had good luck with totem
2008-02-28T00:25:00.000Z	MasterShrak	wolfman2323	system > administration > software sources   and make sure the first 4 boxes are checked, then open synaptic and install gstreamer good bad and ugly
2008-02-28T00:30:00.000Z	MasterShrak	wolfman2323	im guessing youll need some codecs for it
