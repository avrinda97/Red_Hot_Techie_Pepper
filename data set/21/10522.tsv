2007-12-05T20:27:00.000Z	unperson		Hi.  I'm wondering if I have two ubuntu computers on my LAN, is there an easy way to use one as basically nothing more than a display for the other?  Meaning, can I somehow login to a desktop session on the "remote" machine (still on my LAN) using the other machine?
2007-12-05T20:28:00.000Z	Dr_willis	unperson	 simple way.. ssh -Y otherbox, and run your apps.
2007-12-05T20:28:00.000Z	Dr_willis	unperson	 a little harder way. enable/use the XDMCP feature of X.
2007-12-05T20:28:00.000Z	Dr_willis	unperson	 if you want the whole desktop. kde/gnome has a vnc desktop sharing feature (but it can be a bit slow)
2007-12-05T20:29:00.000Z	unperson	Dr_willis	Right, I know about ssh and X forwarding, but that's not quite what I'm after.  I'm looking to make it basically so that one you're logged in you're working on the remote machine completely with no sign that it's not the local machine.
2007-12-05T20:29:00.000Z	unperson	Dr_willis	I see.  Thanks.
2007-12-05T20:29:00.000Z	Dr_willis	unperson	 you just described 'xdmcp' :)
2007-12-05T20:30:00.000Z	Dr_willis	unperson	 in the sessions menus for kdm/gnome theres a  Search for hosts, or query hosts, type feature that can be enabled.
2007-12-05T20:30:00.000Z	Dr_willis	unperson	 however that can get a big laggy if you start doing copying big files over the network.
2007-12-05T20:31:00.000Z	Dr_willis	unperson	 the 'vncserver' method would let you have a presistant desktop on eht remove machine
2007-12-05T20:31:00.000Z	unperson	Dr_willis	Ok, cool.  I thought XDMCP might be what I was looking for, but I wasn't sure.  Most of the descriptions of it I've seen talk about the technical details rather than giving a concise description of what it does.
2007-12-05T20:32:00.000Z	Dr_willis	unperson	 using xdmcp and 'xming' in my windows machiens to get a X desktop on them. :)
2007-12-05T20:33:00.000Z	unperson	Dr_willis	I don't understand the comment about copying large files.  I was thinking that all operations (say moving files) would be performed on the remote machine.  Or are you just talking about display information?
2007-12-05T20:35:00.000Z	Dr_willis	unperson	 if a lot of network traffic happens it can lag your display.
2007-12-05T20:36:00.000Z	Dr_willis	unperson	 the normal use for xdmcp is to let a few dozen+ thin clients have a  'server' they all are using.,
2007-12-05T20:40:00.000Z	unperson	Dr_willis	I see.  Well in my case it would just be 1 computer, so that won't be an issue.
2007-12-05T20:40:00.000Z	unperson	Dr_willis	Thanks for you help.  I'm going to give it a try.
2007-12-05T20:41:00.000Z	Dr_willis	unperson	i just got it set with a 2 pc setup. :) but wheni go copying some iso files from the basement to up here (for me to burn) it can lag my display a little.
2009-03-08T10:42:00.000Z	Dr_willis	unperson	 has been for some time'
2009-03-08T10:42:00.000Z	unperson	Dr_willis	Well, it's been some time since I needed to worry about writing to a windows partition (probably >4 years).
2009-03-08T10:44:00.000Z	unperson	Dr_willis	Whenever it was I last had to worry about it, reading from NTFS worked by writing either didn't exist at all or was considered unreliable, I think.
