2007-05-30T14:37:00.000Z	ph8		hey all
2007-05-30T14:37:00.000Z	ph8		can anyone think why the installer would cause my new machine to 'just die' (tm) when i run it?
2007-05-30T14:37:00.000Z	ph8		just playing with the kubuntu-latest-stable install cd
2007-05-30T14:37:00.000Z	ph8		i can do the memory test
2007-05-30T14:37:00.000Z	ph8		but the installer seems to crash the machine (new, just built)
2007-05-30T14:38:00.000Z	uberushaximus	ph8	did you check the checksum on the ISO?
2007-05-30T14:41:00.000Z	uberushaximus	ph8	I would need to know the very error
2007-05-30T14:41:00.000Z	uberushaximus	ph8	if it's not a kernel panic, then likely no
2007-05-30T15:03:00.000Z	ph8	uberushaximus	i've run install without quiet and with nosplash and vga=771
2007-05-30T15:04:00.000Z	uberushaximus	ph8	umm I've had really long boots with the whole network thing myself, when the person is using broadcom
2007-05-30T15:05:00.000Z	uberushaximus	ph8	I really don't know, it could have been like 15-20 :/
2007-05-30T15:06:00.000Z	uberushaximus	ph8	I wish I knew the boot command to stop that part
2007-05-30T15:06:00.000Z	uberushaximus	ph8	have you ignored him? ;)
2007-05-30T15:16:00.000Z	ph8	uberushaximus	you were right - it's continued now
2007-05-30T15:16:00.000Z	uberushaximus	ph8	glad to assist
2007-05-30T15:17:00.000Z	uberushaximus	ph8	oh sure, the first live boot takes ages
2007-05-30T15:18:00.000Z	uberushaximus	ph8	no, the first time I just think it searches through a lot of drivers or stalls or something
2007-05-30T15:25:00.000Z	ph8	uberushaximus	as long as this?
2007-05-30T15:25:00.000Z	uberushaximus	ph8	I've never had it take that long afterwards
2007-05-30T15:33:00.000Z	ph8	uberushaximus	think it could be the 8800GTX i have in here? or do these things default to a 'basic' gfx mode if not supported do you know?
2007-05-30T15:34:00.000Z	uberushaximus	ph8	xerver supports the nv module, so it should work out of box
