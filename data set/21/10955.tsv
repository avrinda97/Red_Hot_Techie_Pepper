2010-02-22T06:54:00.000Z	sixofour		how do you open 7z on linux?
2010-02-22T06:54:00.000Z	sixofour		ark cannot do it
2010-02-22T06:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sixofour	 if you install the 7z tools it can
2010-02-22T06:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sixofour	 try the command line tools perhaps..
2010-02-22T07:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sixofour	 is it usb? or how plugged in?
2010-02-22T07:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sixofour	 i plug mine in and most gamepads just work in whatever game i  am using
2010-02-22T07:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sixofour	 or is it using a ps2 -> usb adaptor?
2010-02-22T07:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sixofour	 plug it in - check dmesg output - see if its seen/mentioned at the end
2010-02-22T07:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sixofour	 yes 'dmesg' command
2010-02-22T07:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sixofour	 when you pkug in hardware and stuff. the dmesg command at the end. mentions the devices and things it sees
2010-02-22T07:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sixofour	 hage you even tried the thing in a game?
2010-02-28T07:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sixofour	 if it does.. its real real real real high. :)
2010-02-28T07:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sixofour	 be carefull when doing scripts and command line with spaces in names. It can be a bother.
2010-02-28T07:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sixofour	 most file managers handle them fine. Its when you get to the command line they can cause issues.
2010-02-28T07:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sixofour	 it exists.
2010-02-28T07:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sixofour	 the smb config file can set the default permissions for the files.   Unless you used that user 'right click to share' feature. Not sure how you change those.
2010-02-28T08:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sixofour	 i always edit the /etc/samba/smb.conf file - but ive read the docs and have done samba by hand for years. :)
2010-02-28T08:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sixofour	 i tend to just set up the HOME shares so all users have their home dir shared. I dont use 'user created' shares much
2010-02-28T08:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sixofour	 theres proberly some gui tools.. but i dont use them. and i dont know how they mesh with the 'user share' feature'
2010-04-08T20:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sixofour	 you dont mean a 'self installing installer.bin' but a bin/cue cd/dvd image file?
2010-04-08T20:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sixofour	 the fuse iso tools i hear can mount them. or you can convert it to iso. then mount it
