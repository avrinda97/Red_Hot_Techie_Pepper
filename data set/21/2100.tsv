2010-01-27T07:18:00.000Z	stevenheidel		does anyone have any ideas for my first question?
2010-01-27T07:19:00.000Z	stevenheidel		my original question: I have to run these commands "sudo /etc/init.d/virtualbox-ose restart && sudo /etc/init.d/cups restart && sudo /etc/init.d/mysql restart" everytime I log in to get things to work. How can I make it automatic when I start the computer?
2010-01-27T07:21:00.000Z	stevenheidel		tonyayarusso: how do I figure out the original problem?
2010-01-27T07:21:00.000Z	maco	stevenheidel	 are they not starting at all on boot? or are they starting and screwing up on boot such that they need to be restarted?
2010-01-27T07:22:00.000Z	stevenheidel	maco	they're not starting at all
2010-01-27T07:23:00.000Z	maco	stevenheidel	or the command chkconfig
2010-01-27T07:24:00.000Z	stevenheidel	maco	no I haven't tried that
2010-01-27T07:24:00.000Z	maco	stevenheidel	ok...
2010-01-27T07:24:00.000Z	maco	stevenheidel	do the logs say maybe that some service needs to start before them and isnt, but its running by the time you manually start them?
2010-01-27T07:25:00.000Z	stevenheidel	maco	the cups logs say "E [26/Jan/2010:10:10:17 -0600] Unable to remove temporary file "/var/spool/cups/tmp/.hplip" - Is a directory"
2010-01-27T07:25:00.000Z	stevenheidel	maco	there are no files in the mysql directory
2010-01-27T07:27:00.000Z	stevenheidel	maco	command chkconfig shows cups as off but printers are still working
2010-01-27T07:28:00.000Z	maco	stevenheidel	in runlevel 2? chkconfig tells you what should run automatically at boot, not what is running right now
2010-01-27T07:28:00.000Z	maco	stevenheidel	chkconfig --list | grep cups
2010-01-27T07:28:00.000Z	maco	stevenheidel	for example
2010-01-27T07:29:00.000Z	stevenheidel	maco	2 is off
2010-01-27T07:29:00.000Z	maco	stevenheidel	ok try turning that on then
2010-01-27T07:29:00.000Z	maco	stevenheidel	if i remember right... sudo chkconfig add cups --levels 2
2010-01-27T07:33:00.000Z	maco	stevenheidel	errors?
2010-01-27T07:35:00.000Z	maco	stevenheidel	sudo chkconfig --set cups on
