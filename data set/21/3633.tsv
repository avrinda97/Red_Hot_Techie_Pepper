2008-11-07T10:56:00.000Z	Twerk^		to be honest i tried debian yesterday
2008-11-07T10:56:00.000Z	Twerk^		it didnt work either
2008-11-07T10:56:00.000Z	jim_p	Twerk^	do you face any specific problem?
2008-11-07T10:56:00.000Z	Twerk^	jim_p	i cannot get either grub nor lilo to boot my machine
2008-11-07T10:57:00.000Z	jim_p	Twerk^	are you on raid or something?
2008-11-07T10:57:00.000Z	Twerk^	jim_p	no.  its a single IDE drive but its in an ibm server so it may have a funky hard drive controller
2008-11-07T10:58:00.000Z	jim_p	Twerk^	well you can install lilo in debian and ubuntu if you want.
2008-11-07T10:59:00.000Z	Twerk^	jim_p	i attempted that and i recieve this:
2008-11-07T11:00:00.000Z	jim_p	Twerk^	is there a chance the drive WAS on raid with some other drive?
2008-11-07T11:00:00.000Z	Twerk^	jim_p	not a chance it was pulled from an apple.
2008-11-07T11:01:00.000Z	jim_p	Twerk^	is it connected straight to the mobo?
2008-11-07T11:01:00.000Z	Twerk^	jim_p	it partitions ok, i got gpg to boot from the mbr i even got debian to boot with lilo but got a kernel panic.  i tried the ubuntu live disc to fix my debian install and said "screw it i'll use ubuntu.. if the live disc boots what problem could i have??"
2008-11-07T11:01:00.000Z	Twerk^	jim_p	yes.
2008-11-07T11:02:00.000Z	jim_p	Twerk^	is it like... encrypted?!?! the whole drive?
2008-11-07T11:03:00.000Z	Twerk^	jim_p	i would have to encrypt it no?  i have not done such a thing
2008-11-07T11:03:00.000Z	jim_p	Twerk^	because you mention some gpg key
2008-11-07T11:04:00.000Z	Twerk^	jim_p	where do you see mention to GPG?
2008-11-07T11:04:00.000Z	jim_p	Twerk^	..... i got gpg to boot from the mbr i even got debian to boot with lilo but got a kernel panic.  i tried the ubuntu live disc to fix my debian install and said "screw it i'll use ubuntu.. if the live disc boots wha..........
2008-11-07T11:04:00.000Z	jim_p	Twerk^	sorry then
2008-11-07T11:05:00.000Z	Twerk^	jim_p	any suggestions?
2008-11-07T11:08:00.000Z	jim_p	Twerk^	let me think
