2005-02-02T14:54:00.000Z	cutterjohn		ubuntu has an apparent affinity for python, other than its horrid whitespace delimitation its not bad
2005-02-02T14:55:00.000Z	cutterjohn		...and not nearly as obscufatable as perl...
2005-02-02T14:55:00.000Z	cutterjohn		yes, shades of FORTRAN regardless of what drivel the python people say...
2005-02-02T14:57:00.000Z	cutterjohn		yes, but slower...
2005-02-02T14:57:00.000Z	cutterjohn		lua have been nice too, but its not really usable for anything largish...
2005-02-02T14:59:00.000Z	cutterjohn		I'm a whatever scripting language that is NOT a functional based language and NOT whitespace delimited type of scripter...
2005-02-02T14:59:00.000Z	cutterjohn		(...and not easily obfuscated...)
2005-02-02T15:00:00.000Z	geoffj	cutterjohn	IOW; not perl or python :)
2005-02-02T14:00:00.000Z	geoffj	cutterjohn	lsb-release is in warty
2005-02-02T15:00:00.000Z	cutterjohn	geoffj	yes
2005-02-02T15:04:00.000Z	cutterjohn	geoffj	I've spent longer than that with it because some things Im interested in insist on using, and I still HATE the white space delimitation, and do NOT find it helpful
2005-02-02T15:07:00.000Z	cutterjohn	geoffj	I meant for whatever sort of delimitation that python uses it for, which is pretty much everything
2005-02-02T15:09:00.000Z	cutterjohn	geoffj	you can get emacs(or even vim for that matter or most other text editors) to reformat just about anything to anything that you might want...
2005-02-02T15:11:00.000Z	geoffj	cutterjohn	I mean if x=1 is indented but x=2 is not you get a different program than if x=2 is indented. Hence emacs can't indent that automatically for you but subterrific said it could (so I interpreted)
2005-02-02T15:12:00.000Z	cutterjohn	geoffj	I see what you're really getting at, I wasn't paying attention, but yes you could still do it, but it would have to be case-by-case
2005-02-02T15:12:00.000Z	cutterjohn	geoffj	and would be non-deterministic
2005-02-02T15:12:00.000Z	cutterjohn	geoffj	and I think that we were declared offtopic anyways
2005-02-02T15:12:00.000Z	geoffj	cutterjohn	I think so :)
2005-02-02T15:13:00.000Z	cutterjohn	geoffj	maybe we should insist on rewriting everything in Ada?
2005-02-02T15:13:00.000Z	geoffj	cutterjohn	lol
2005-02-02T15:14:00.000Z	cutterjohn	geoffj	then we could maybe get DARPA funding...
