2012-05-04T13:33:00.000Z	REK_007	DarwinSurvivor	yeah well I know that .. I need to scan another PC's HDD using ubuntu
2012-05-04T13:35:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	REK_007	avast appears to support 32 bit only on linux (according to their website). You could try another scanner such as ClamAV, or run Avast off of a 32-bit live-cd (32bit ubuntu will run fine on 64bit hardware)
2012-05-04T13:37:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	REK_007	if you have a 32bit install CD you could boot off of it, or you could use a virtual machine (like VirtualBox) and scan using that
2012-05-04T13:39:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	REK_007	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=781251 may help you
2012-05-08T10:29:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	REK_007	for non-xfce-specific stuff yes, but you may get better answers in the #xubuntu channel
2012-05-08T10:29:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	REK_007	is your question specific to xfce?
2012-05-08T10:29:00.000Z	REK_007	DarwinSurvivor	not exactly
2012-05-08T10:30:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	REK_007	then go ahead and ask. worst thing that will happen is nobody will have an answer
2012-05-08T10:31:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	REK_007	what is the *root* issue you are trying to solve?
2012-05-08T10:31:00.000Z	REK_007	DarwinSurvivor	dont think this is a XFCE related problem .. anyway just kept that channel handy as I will need it
2012-05-08T10:31:00.000Z	REK_007	DarwinSurvivor	I am trying to mount a few folders and bind them to a location .
2012-05-08T10:32:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	REK_007	I think you are looking for fstab which can already do mounting and binding at boot (it's what mount the / partition!)
2012-05-08T10:33:00.000Z	REK_007	DarwinSurvivor	no am not looking for fstab .. am looking for a seperate script that does "mount --bind <location> <target>"
2012-05-08T10:35:00.000Z	REK_007	DarwinSurvivor	actually I have made the script it works fine when called on . Only thing I want is to start it up .
2012-05-08T10:35:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	REK_007	I just check'd mount's man page and fstab does in fact support the bind option
2012-05-08T10:36:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	REK_007	/olddir /newdir none bind
2012-05-08T10:36:00.000Z	REK_007	DarwinSurvivor	But I dont want to ingrate it into fstab ... i know it supports it
