2012-05-27T08:28:00.000Z	rootyourself		make sure you replace ext4 with the correct fs type on the partition
2012-05-27T08:28:00.000Z	rootyourself		no
2012-05-27T08:28:00.000Z	rootyourself		it can? well nice.  didn't know that
2012-05-27T08:30:00.000Z	rootyourself		i have never successfully mounted non enumerated partitions
2012-05-27T08:30:00.000Z	rootyourself		i'd like to try tho
2012-05-27T08:31:00.000Z	rootyourself		acpi -V
2012-05-27T08:32:00.000Z	rootyourself		with that many partitions, you are sure to hose something
2012-05-27T08:33:00.000Z	rootyourself		but as a consideration, if your system is old enough, you can end up hosing your windows partition scheme
2012-05-27T08:33:00.000Z	rootyourself		may not be an issue any more perhaps
2012-05-27T08:34:00.000Z	xisor_	rootyourself	he needs to create restore cds, because by default ubuntu installer will install grub to /dev/sda and he wont be able to boot into the recovery app anymore
2012-05-27T08:34:00.000Z	xisor_	rootyourself	had that happen on this laptop earlier today as a matter of fact
2012-05-27T08:35:00.000Z	xisor_	rootyourself	not like i care personally, ive got windows cds if i ever need to, but for most, yea make those recovery discs
2012-05-27T08:35:00.000Z	rootyourself	xisor_	i keep on forgetting that the big manufacturers have restore partitions.  i have not bought a windows machine in like 15 years.

2012-05-27T08:36:00.000Z	xisor_	rootyourself	i dont know how myself, im no expert
2012-05-27T08:38:00.000Z	xisor_	rootyourself	 honestly for a general home user who also wants to keep windows, wubi isnt a bad choice
2012-05-27T08:39:00.000Z	xisor_	rootyourself	you lose what? a little bit of disk performance, nothing major ona  modern machine
2012-05-27T08:39:00.000Z	rootyourself	xisor_	never said it was.  i'm trying to make sure Daniel110 doesn't loose what she needs the most.
2012-05-27T08:40:00.000Z	xisor_	rootyourself	i agree, which is windows, and with the partition scheme used by default, he/she may just
