2004-10-18T13:33:00.000Z	swoon		hello
2004-10-18T13:33:00.000Z	swoon		how can I stop ubuntu from starting x at boot?
2004-10-18T13:34:00.000Z	Treenaks	swoon	you don't want that :)
2004-10-18T13:34:00.000Z	swoon	Treenaks	why not
2004-10-18T13:34:00.000Z	Treenaks	swoon	but removing the S99gdm link from /etc/rc2.d should do the trick
2004-10-18T13:34:00.000Z	Treenaks	swoon	because there's no reason not to use X :)
2004-10-18T13:35:00.000Z	Treenaks	swoon	I mean.. 1 text console or (at least) 4 xterms...
2004-10-18T13:35:00.000Z	swoon	Treenaks	I think there are many reasons not to use x
2004-10-18T13:35:00.000Z	Treenaks	swoon	like servers, but then you just don't install X
2004-10-18T13:35:00.000Z	swoon		so if I remove that line, to start x I can just do: "gdm" ?
2004-10-18T13:35:00.000Z	Treenaks	swoon	which is different from not starting it :)
2004-10-18T13:35:00.000Z	Treenaks	swoon	no, startx
2004-10-18T13:36:00.000Z	swoon		I didnt think ubuntu used startx Treenaks
2004-10-18T13:36:00.000Z	Treenaks	swoon	it's included... just not used by default
2004-10-18T13:36:00.000Z	swoon	Treenaks	what is used as default?
2004-10-18T13:36:00.000Z	Treenaks	swoon	gdm
2004-10-18T13:37:00.000Z	swoon		ah ok
2004-10-18T13:37:00.000Z	Treenaks	swoon	but that's a daemon, so you can't start that as user
2004-10-18T13:37:00.000Z	swoon		gotchyah
2004-10-18T13:39:00.000Z	swoon	Treenaks	I dont have the machine here, so if removing that link doesnt work is there anything else I should do? or will that deffinetly work?
2004-10-18T13:40:00.000Z	Treenaks	swoon	that will work
