2004-12-25T16:15:00.000Z	Kamion		this one
2004-12-25T16:16:00.000Z	Kamion		varies rather a lot by model, that does
2004-12-25T16:16:00.000Z	Kamion		I'm not sure all of them are supported by the kernel
2004-12-25T16:16:00.000Z	Kamion		note that the AlBook basically uses its case as a heatsink; this is normal
2004-12-25T16:17:00.000Z	SirFunk	Kamion	my fans are on like non-stop with OSX
2004-12-25T16:17:00.000Z	Kamion	SirFunk	feel free to file a bug if it's running radically hotter than Mac OS or whatever, though. Make sure to include a tarball of /proc/device-tree
2004-12-25T16:17:00.000Z	SirFunk	Kamion	i mean.. i'll cehck that out
2004-12-25T16:18:00.000Z	Kamion	SirFunk	what kind of powerbook?
2004-12-25T16:20:00.000Z	Kamion	SirFunk	refer to http://lists.debian.org/debian-powerpc/2004/12/msg00067.html
2004-12-25T16:21:00.000Z	SirFunk	Kamion	hmm... /sys/devices/temperatures does not exist
2004-12-25T16:22:00.000Z	Kamion	SirFunk	are any therm* drivers actually loaded?
2004-12-25T16:22:00.000Z	SirFunk	Kamion	one sec
2004-12-25T16:22:00.000Z	SirFunk	Kamion	nope, none loaded
2004-12-25T16:23:00.000Z	SirFunk	Kamion	when i try to load them it says "no such device"
2004-12-25T16:23:00.000Z	Kamion	SirFunk	did you try all of them?
2004-12-25T16:24:00.000Z	SirFunk	Kamion	yeah there's only 2
2004-12-25T16:24:00.000Z	Kamion	SirFunk	therm_adt746x and therm_windtunnel, right?
2004-12-25T16:25:00.000Z	Kamion	SirFunk	sounds like your board isn't supported by the version of the kernel you're running ...
2004-12-25T16:25:00.000Z	SirFunk	Kamion	that blows
2004-12-25T16:26:00.000Z	SirFunk	Kamion	i'm using 2.6.9
2004-12-25T16:26:00.000Z	Kamion	SirFunk	then definitely file a bug
