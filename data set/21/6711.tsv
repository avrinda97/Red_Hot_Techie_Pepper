2007-03-24T07:37:00.000Z	sarixe		blameless still here?
2007-03-24T07:38:00.000Z	sarixe		!vnc
2007-03-24T07:38:00.000Z	sarixe		oo, vnc over ssh
2007-03-24T07:39:00.000Z	sarixe		alright.  i was in here a few minutes ago, talking to blameless about setting up a better vnc server, while connected remotely.
2007-03-24T07:39:00.000Z	sarixe		blameless suggested i do it over ssh
2007-03-24T07:39:00.000Z	sarixe		and so i installed an ssh server, which i'm connected to right now.
2007-03-24T07:40:00.000Z	sarixe		so i close the connection to my vnc server, which i think is alright for now... but now i can't get back on it.
2007-03-24T07:40:00.000Z	sarixe		any help?
2007-03-24T07:41:00.000Z	sarixe		damn! where did cables go...
2007-03-24T07:42:00.000Z	sarixe		alright... so i'm stuck connected to my computer through ssh only... anyone know how to actually start a vnc server remotely, preferably tightvnc?
2007-03-24T07:43:00.000Z	yell0w	sarixe	sudo /etc/init.d/tightvnc start ?
2007-03-24T07:43:00.000Z	sarixe	yell0w	will do
2007-03-24T07:43:00.000Z	yell0w	sarixe	might want to tab a couples of times
2007-03-24T07:43:00.000Z	yell0w		woops!
2007-03-24T07:46:00.000Z	sarixe	yell0w	alright, i tried that, but there are no init scripts for vnc whatsoever, at least in /etc/init.d
2007-03-24T07:46:00.000Z	yell0w	sarixe	if you have vino running that should be /vino-server start
2007-03-24T07:46:00.000Z	sarixe	yell0w	alright, trying
2007-03-24T07:46:00.000Z	sarixe		btw, any way to keep bitchx open while going back to the command line?
2007-03-24T07:46:00.000Z	yell0w	sarixe	for tightvnc the name might be different, just type T then tab
2007-03-24T07:47:00.000Z	sarixe	yell0w	there's no tightvnc init script
2007-03-24T07:47:00.000Z	sarixe	yell0w	anyway, brb
