2006-04-05T08:48:00.000Z	unL33Tn00b		How do I get to the internal router hompage of my router, when I have a 192.168.10.100 IP address currently, and 192.168.10.1, 192.168.1.1, 192.168.10.128 all don't work for addresses.
2006-04-05T08:49:00.000Z	unL33Tn00b		It's a zonet ZSR0104C series router.
2006-04-05T08:50:00.000Z	healot	unL33Tn00b	ifconfig -a
2006-04-05T08:51:00.000Z	unL33Tn00b	healot	Ok, you want that in pastebin?
2006-04-05T08:52:00.000Z	unL33Tn00b	healot	http://pastebin.com/631972
2006-04-05T08:56:00.000Z	unL33Tn00b	healot	Any thoughts?
2006-04-05T09:00:00.000Z	unL33Tn00b	healot	I have no idea what you mean.  I'm trying to set my MU* up..
2006-04-05T09:00:00.000Z	unL33Tn00b	healot	and I need to be able to connect it to the wevb
2006-04-09T15:37:00.000Z	healot	unL33Tn00b	a lot... out there...
2006-04-09T15:38:00.000Z	unL33Tn00b	healot	Really?  I need something that I don't have to liscence (free).
2006-04-09T15:39:00.000Z	unL33Tn00b	healot	I meant something that was covered by GPL (is that correct?)
2006-04-09T15:40:00.000Z	unL33Tn00b	healot	Basicly I need something I needn't pay for, am not pirating, and runs on *nix (I'll use almost any distro)
2006-04-09T15:40:00.000Z	healot	unL33Tn00b	what type of app?
2006-04-09T15:41:00.000Z	healot	unL33Tn00b	I guarantee you'll pay, for the support though... most of the licenses are free (no charge)
2006-04-09T15:41:00.000Z	unL33Tn00b	healot	That's fine. I expected that.
2006-04-09T15:42:00.000Z	unL33Tn00b	healot	Just need a simple scheduler for labor shifts.
2006-04-09T15:42:00.000Z	unL33Tn00b	healot	Providing support?
2006-04-09T15:43:00.000Z	unL33Tn00b	healot	I'll take what I can find.  Right now, just about anything would improve it.  My people are currently hasjing it out manually on paper.  Take 'em -hours-.
2006-04-09T15:44:00.000Z	healot	unL33Tn00b	something like a HRM would suit you?
2006-04-09T15:45:00.000Z	unL33Tn00b	healot	Could you define HRM?
2006-04-09T15:46:00.000Z	unL33Tn00b	healot	Frogzoo Wow!  That link looks exactly like what I'm looking for!  I can't express my gratitude!
