2008-10-27T08:48:00.000Z	sleven	maco	^
2008-10-27T08:48:00.000Z	maco	sleven	import?
2008-10-27T08:49:00.000Z	maco	sleven	that's because your script is just plain broken
2008-10-27T08:49:00.000Z	sleven	maco	import re
2008-10-27T08:49:00.000Z	maco	sleven	or.....hrm it starts with #! /usr/bin/python, doesn't it?
2008-10-27T08:49:00.000Z	maco	sleven	it looks like it's trying to run it in the shell instead of as python
2008-10-27T08:49:00.000Z	sleven	maco	lol ofc, after i change it ;)
2008-10-27T08:50:00.000Z	maco	sleven	so the first line has the #! stuff?
2008-10-27T08:51:00.000Z	maco	sleven	ps -e
2008-10-27T08:53:00.000Z	maco	sleven	no, that just sends sigterm, so it's telling the app to close itself nicely
2008-10-27T08:55:00.000Z	sleven	maco	ok sometimes on windows when i runa program of mine it eats up all the memory and it even freezes the task manager so i cant close it. i have heard that linux-systems by default kill such processes as soon as they eat up to much resources, true? such things never happens on linux then?

2008-10-27T09:05:00.000Z	maco	sleven	LPIC-1?
2008-10-27T09:05:00.000Z	maco	sleven	Linux Professionals Institute Certification
2008-10-27T09:06:00.000Z	maco	sleven	-1 is "junior sysadmin", -2 is "intermediate"...you can get ubuntu certified after you pass -1
2008-10-27T09:08:00.000Z	sleven	maco	i see, but its more of an admin exam it seems. im thinking kernel developer, is there something for that?
