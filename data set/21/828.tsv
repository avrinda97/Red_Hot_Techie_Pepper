2011-10-17T16:18:00.000Z	GuitarBizarre		Hey, newbie question here, I'm trying to install some variant of snes9x on my netbook, compaq 311C, lubuntu 11.10, new install
2011-10-17T16:18:00.000Z	GuitarBizarre		I'm finding it difficult, most repositories seem to be out of date on either the build or the version of ubuntu to which they refer
2011-10-17T16:18:00.000Z	GuitarBizarre		I keep finding references to gsnes9x, but it seems the ubuntu repositories don't have this package, terminal says package not found
2011-10-17T16:18:00.000Z	GuitarBizarre		I've got a tar.bz2 I can find, of course, but I'm rather hopeless with such things
2011-10-17T16:18:00.000Z	GuitarBizarre		and I'd prefer a graphical frontend, I believe the vanilla snes9x releases are command line
2011-10-17T16:19:00.000Z	iceroot	GuitarBizarre	snes9x is in the repos (or zsnes)
2011-10-17T16:19:00.000Z	iceroot	GuitarBizarre	so you dont need the tar.gz
2011-10-17T16:19:00.000Z	GuitarBizarre	iceroot	- not a fan of zsnes, and apt-get snes9x or gsnes9x says package not found
2011-10-17T16:20:00.000Z	iceroot	GuitarBizarre	yes, only zsnes is in the repos
2011-10-17T16:20:00.000Z	iceroot	GuitarBizarre	download the tar.gz, right click -> extraxt. extract it in your home and then start the snes9x script
2011-10-17T16:21:00.000Z	GuitarBizarre	iceroot	ok. Is there a graphical frontend I can use with it?
2011-10-17T16:21:00.000Z	iceroot	GuitarBizarre	for extracting?
2011-10-17T16:21:00.000Z	iceroot	GuitarBizarre	or for snes9x itself?
2011-10-17T16:21:00.000Z	iceroot	GuitarBizarre	it has a gui by default
2011-10-17T16:21:00.000Z	GuitarBizarre	iceroot	Ah, I've been informed otherwise. Let me install and see who's correct
2011-10-17T16:24:00.000Z	GuitarBizarre	iceroot	Hmm. I ran the script, it asks me whether I want to execute it, I choose execute in terminal, and nothing happens
2011-10-17T16:25:00.000Z	GuitarBizarre	iceroot	is this because I'm using lubuntu? do I need the gtk packages?
2011-10-17T16:25:00.000Z	iceroot	GuitarBizarre	can you paste me the url to the tar.gz?
2011-10-17T16:25:00.000Z	iceroot	GuitarBizarre	so i can check it here
2011-10-17T16:26:00.000Z	iceroot	GuitarBizarre	sorry url is blocked here :(
2011-10-17T16:26:00.000Z	GuitarBizarre	iceroot	bo problem
