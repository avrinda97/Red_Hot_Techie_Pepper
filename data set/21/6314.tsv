2007-04-30T09:15:00.000Z	Parmenion	R3ddy	ok
2007-04-30T09:16:00.000Z	Parmenion	R3ddy	turn off the encryption(if any) on your wireless network
2007-04-30T09:16:00.000Z	R3ddy		parmenion: its an open network.. no restrictions.. i cant see why it shouldnt work
2007-04-30T09:16:00.000Z	Parmenion	R3ddy	:P alright
2007-04-30T09:16:00.000Z	Parmenion		then , R3ddy try out wifi-radar from the repositories ... if it doesnt work for you, ive got another option; wicd
2007-04-30T09:17:00.000Z	R3ddy	delire	how do i do that?
2007-04-30T09:17:00.000Z	R3ddy		you mean, my network card?
2007-04-30T09:17:00.000Z	Parmenion	R3ddy	use synaptic and remove network-manager
2007-04-30T09:17:00.000Z	Parmenion		then install wicd(look in sourceforge)
2007-04-30T09:17:00.000Z	R3ddy		parmenion: im really a n00b, and im not very familiar with linux
2007-04-30T09:18:00.000Z	Parmenion	R3ddy	you just need to open synaptic and then search for network-manager
2007-04-30T09:19:00.000Z	Parmenion		after which, R3ddy you need to do a complete removal(right click, completely remove) of network-manager and network-manager-gnome(or something like that)
2007-04-30T09:21:00.000Z	Parmenion		then, go to http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=194573
2007-04-30T09:21:00.000Z	Parmenion	R3ddy	then download wicd and install it
