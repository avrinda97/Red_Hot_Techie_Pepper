2010-04-04T00:49:00.000Z	Gelfling	`Jack	are you connecting using your ip address instead of a name server?
2010-04-04T00:49:00.000Z	`Jack	Gelfling	connecting on what ?
2010-04-04T00:49:00.000Z	Gelfling	`Jack	 the irc server
2010-04-04T00:50:00.000Z	Gelfling	`Jack	are you using any type of firewall in ubuntu ?
