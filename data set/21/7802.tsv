2007-01-23T11:05:00.000Z	wheels3572		Ok I have a VERY strange Issue.  Anyone ever heard of Downloading 6.10 and it end up saying 6.06 when its' said and done?
2007-01-23T11:06:00.000Z	wheels3572		isnt edgy 6.10?
2007-01-23T11:07:00.000Z	wheels3572		My contents in the ISO reads ./dists/edgy/main/dist-upgrader/binary-all/edgy.tar.gz
2007-01-23T11:09:00.000Z	wheels3572		Is there any other way to install an ISO if my CD-Rom Drive will NOT read the CD
2007-01-23T11:09:00.000Z	NthDegree	wheels3572	there is one crazy way
2007-01-23T11:10:00.000Z	NthDegree	wheels3572	VMWare and install ubuntu that way
2007-01-23T11:10:00.000Z	wheels3572	NthDegree	well right now I cant get install onto my desktop cuz my CDRW will NOT read the CD-R but my laptop reads it perfectly and installs perfectly on the laptop jus tnot desktop
2007-01-23T11:10:00.000Z	NthDegree	wheels3572	get it to use a physical partition
2007-01-23T11:11:00.000Z	NthDegree		install vmware
2007-01-23T11:11:00.000Z	NthDegree		then use the ISO file as a cdrom
2007-01-23T11:11:00.000Z	wheels3572	NthDegree	I have VMWARE actually already instead
2007-01-23T11:11:00.000Z	NthDegree		then use hard disk as a separate physical partion
2007-01-23T11:11:00.000Z	NthDegree		then install from livecd
2007-01-23T11:11:00.000Z	NthDegree		then boot from the physical raw hardware
2007-01-23T11:12:00.000Z	NthDegree		and one working copy of ubuntu NOT inside vmware
2007-01-23T11:12:00.000Z	NthDegree		but as I said it's crazy :p
2007-01-23T11:12:00.000Z	wheels3572	NthDegree	but that still does not solve the issue of my ISO needing to be read from CD right?
2007-01-23T11:12:00.000Z	NthDegree		it does solve it
2007-01-23T11:12:00.000Z	NthDegree		VMWare can read the ISO file
2007-01-23T11:12:00.000Z	NthDegree		and mount as a virtual CD
2007-01-23T11:12:00.000Z	wheels3572	NthDegree	ohhh ok
