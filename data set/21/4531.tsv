2008-05-17T08:22:00.000Z	bingoer		I have a brand new install of hardy heron, and  I'm facing some problems with Firefox 3 beta 5
2008-05-17T08:23:00.000Z	dmsuperman	bingoer	your best bet is to just install firefox 2
2008-05-17T08:24:00.000Z	bingoer	dmsuperman	did you face the same problem ?
2008-05-17T08:25:00.000Z	dmsuperman	bingoer	there's plenty of problems in firefox 3, i'd stay away until it's stable
2008-05-17T08:25:00.000Z	dmsuperman	bingoer	quite a few people come in here with firefox problems
2008-05-17T08:26:00.000Z	dmsuperman	bingoer	good luck, to this day i still can't get wireless drivers to work with my dell laptop
2008-05-17T08:30:00.000Z	bingoer	dmsuperman	did you also remove the firefox meta package ?
2008-05-17T08:30:00.000Z	dmsuperman	bingoer	I just did sudo apt-get remove --purge firefox* and removed everything it asked, then installed firefox-2
2008-05-17T08:55:00.000Z	bingoer	dmsuperman	silly me, the cursor still jumps in firefox 2
2008-05-17T08:56:00.000Z	bingoer	dmsuperman	it could be a touchpad sensitivity issue as per on of the threads
2008-05-17T08:56:00.000Z	dmsuperman	bingoer	?

2008-05-17T08:56:00.000Z	bingoer	dmsuperman	it could be a touchpad sensitivity issue as per one of the threads
2008-05-17T08:56:00.000Z	dmsuperman	bingoer	Oh, missed that. I was just switching IRC clients
2008-05-17T08:57:00.000Z	dmsuperman	bingoer	Perhaps. I know on my dad's laptop, you'll accidently barely brush the touchpad and click elsewhere, very obnoxious
2008-05-17T08:57:00.000Z	dmsuperman	bingoer	luckily his has a little button to disable/enable the touchpad
2008-05-17T08:57:00.000Z	bingoer	dmsuperman	i was actually very careful to keep my palms away from the touchpad so I'm still not convinced
2008-05-17T08:58:00.000Z	dmsuperman	bingoer	Try and lift your hands completely up and type with fingertyips, very quickly, I'd say that's a proper test
2008-05-17T08:59:00.000Z	bingoer	dmsuperman	hmm, it worked
2008-05-17T09:00:00.000Z	dmsuperman	bingoer	Now all you have to do is find a way to set a hotkey to disable the touchpad
