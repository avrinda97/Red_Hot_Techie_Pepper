2006-08-29T10:50:00.000Z	archaios		some partition management programs can do it
2006-08-29T10:50:00.000Z	archaios		but not many
2006-08-29T10:50:00.000Z	archaios		you can switch from ext2 to ext3 easily
2006-08-29T10:50:00.000Z	archaios		and vice-versa
2006-08-29T10:50:00.000Z	archaios		tune2fs -j, etc
2006-08-29T10:51:00.000Z	archaios		possibly lib if it's not there
2006-08-29T10:52:00.000Z	archaios		in either case
2006-08-29T10:52:00.000Z	archaios		and enable data journalling
2006-08-29T10:52:00.000Z	archaios		which is easy enough
2006-08-29T10:52:00.000Z	archaios		higher performance and the same level of safety
2006-08-29T10:52:00.000Z	brendonjt	archaios	 what about from fat32
2006-08-29T10:53:00.000Z	brendonjt	archaios	 what about from fat32 to say ext3  or reiser
2006-08-29T10:53:00.000Z	archaios	brendonjt	the only option there is to backup and repartition
2006-08-29T10:53:00.000Z	brendonjt	archaios	 i have a backup drive and it is fat32
2006-08-29T11:31:00.000Z	archaios	brendonjt	mount -o uid=xx,gid=xx
2006-08-29T11:31:00.000Z	archaios	brendonjt	or specify it in the fourth field of fstab
2006-08-29T11:32:00.000Z	archaios	brendonjt	there's also umask=xxx
2006-08-29T11:32:00.000Z	archaios	brendonjt	who do you want to have access to this mount?
2006-08-29T11:33:00.000Z	archaios	brendonjt	ok
2006-08-29T11:34:00.000Z	archaios	brendonjt	change field 4 from "defaults" to "defaults,mode=777"
2006-08-29T11:34:00.000Z	archaios	brendonjt	in /etc/fstab
