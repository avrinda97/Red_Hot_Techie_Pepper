2010-06-02T02:17:00.000Z	ZenMasta		I just tried creating a usb drive according to the steps here http://www.ubuntu.com/server/get-ubuntu/download However, when I boot to the usb drive it just asks if I want to install, if I choose to install it asks me to insert the cdrom
2010-06-02T02:17:00.000Z	rvn	ZenMasta	wow, that's odd. does the live mode work?
2010-06-02T02:18:00.000Z	rvn	ZenMasta	if it does, install from within that.
2010-06-02T02:18:00.000Z	ZenMasta	rvn	there is no live option because it is the server iso
2010-06-02T02:18:00.000Z	rvn	ZenMasta	if not, i dunno
2010-06-02T02:18:00.000Z	rvn	ZenMasta	ah
2010-06-02T02:18:00.000Z	rvn	ZenMasta	shouldn't it allow you to boot to a live command line then though
2010-06-02T02:20:00.000Z	ZenMasta	rvn	there is an "advanced options" item in the list when I boot up but i have'nt tried that
2010-06-02T02:20:00.000Z	rvn	ZenMasta	u might wanna look at that, but i must admit ur out of my comfort zone with ubuntu advice, so my help stops here
2010-06-02T02:20:00.000Z	rvn	ZenMasta	i've installed server from cd and desktop from usb, but never server from usb
2010-06-02T02:21:00.000Z	rvn	ZenMasta	also, did you try unetbootin to make ur usb stick/
2010-06-02T02:21:00.000Z	rvn	ZenMasta	that's what i use - i'm not sure what those instructions say
2010-06-02T02:25:00.000Z	ZenMasta	rvn	i just checked but the advanced option only was to recover a broken  system :'(
2010-06-02T02:25:00.000Z	rvn	ZenMasta	did you make ur bootable usb with "unetbootin"?
2010-06-02T02:26:00.000Z	ZenMasta	rvn	I dont know what that is I just followed the instructions on the download site and used the universal usb installer
2010-06-02T02:26:00.000Z	rvn	ZenMasta	http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/ <--- use this instead, it's what i use and it works every time no problems - does everything on it's own too
2010-06-02T02:29:00.000Z	ZenMasta	rvn	thanks for the link can't hurt to try something new since nothing else is workin
2010-06-02T02:30:00.000Z	rvn	ZenMasta	i love that tool, have had nothing but positive experience with it, so it ought to work for ya
2010-06-02T02:30:00.000Z	ZenMasta	rvn	awe, ubuntu server isn't in the distribution list :(
2010-06-02T02:30:00.000Z	ZenMasta	rvn	the first part is asking to download. looks neat
2010-06-02T02:58:00.000Z	ZenMasta	rvn	you still there
