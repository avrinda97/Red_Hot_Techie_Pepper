2007-07-28T10:21:00.000Z	ashnickel		ok, please help, how do I change permissions of a file or folder from root to me
2007-07-28T10:21:00.000Z	reanjr	ashnickel	chown me:me file
2007-07-28T10:22:00.000Z	ashnickel	reanjr	I'm very new to this, please explain?
2007-07-28T10:22:00.000Z	reanjr	ashnickel	are you at the command line where the file is?
2007-07-28T10:22:00.000Z	reanjr	ashnickel	or are you using a file manager
2007-07-28T10:22:00.000Z	ashnickel	reanjr	the file is on my desktop
2007-07-28T10:25:00.000Z	ashnickel	reanjr	ok, so I type sudo chown ashnickel: and then the file name? so ashnickel/desktop/hplip?
2007-07-28T10:26:00.000Z	reanjr	ashnickel	sudo chown ashnickel:ashnickel ashnickel/desktop/hplip
2007-07-28T10:27:00.000Z	reanjr	ashnickel	or... sudo chown ashnickel:ashnickel ~/desktop/hplip ... if that doesn't work
2007-07-28T10:30:00.000Z	ashnickel	reanjr	it didn't work, either way, whether capitalized or not   error:   ashnickel@dell:~$ sudo chown ashnickel:ashnickel/desktop/hplip-2.7.6
2007-07-28T10:30:00.000Z	reanjr	ashnickel	try running gksu nautilus
2007-07-28T10:30:00.000Z	ashnickel	reanjr	where do i find that?
2007-07-28T10:30:00.000Z	reanjr	ashnickel	once that is running, browse to the file , right-click and go to properties, then the permissions tab; should be able to change it from there
2007-07-28T10:30:00.000Z	reanjr	ashnickel	hit Alt-F2 and type it in there
2007-07-28T10:48:00.000Z	ashnickel	reanjr	i have tried all things, and the gknu nautilus doesn't even show me the file
2007-07-28T10:48:00.000Z	reanjr	ashnickel	how do you know it is there?
2007-07-28T10:48:00.000Z	reanjr	ashnickel	is it on your desktop?
2007-07-28T10:49:00.000Z	reanjr	ashnickel	try the gksu nautilus thing and navigate to File System/home/ashnickel/Desktop
2007-07-28T10:49:00.000Z	ashnickel	reanjr	ok, let me try that
2007-07-28T10:51:00.000Z	ashnickel	reanjr	thank you. that unlocked it for me
2007-07-28T10:51:00.000Z	reanjr	ashnickel	no problem
