2011-05-13T15:04:00.000Z	fdel		Does someone know how to make Shift-PageUp/Down work in ttys like they do in terminals (e.g. scrolling)?
2011-05-13T15:04:00.000Z	quiescens	fdel	it usually does as far as i remember?
2011-05-13T15:05:00.000Z	fdel		in a xterm/gnome-terminal it does, not in a real tty
2011-05-13T15:06:00.000Z	fdel	quiescens	e.g. in /dev/tty1
2011-05-13T15:06:00.000Z	quiescens	fdel	they are supposed to
2011-05-13T15:08:00.000Z	quiescens	fdel	works for me on an unmodified 10.10 server
2011-05-13T15:09:00.000Z	fdel	quiescens	hmm... odd did you install any special package?
2011-05-13T15:10:00.000Z	quiescens	fdel	fresh install with nothing installed at all
2011-05-13T15:10:00.000Z	fdel	quiescens	on my laptop, the PgUp and PgDown are on the same position as the 9 and 3 on the numeric keypad. Could that be related?
2011-05-13T15:10:00.000Z	quiescens	fdel	are you using screen?
2011-05-13T15:10:00.000Z	fdel	quiescens	no screen
2011-05-13T15:10:00.000Z	quiescens	fdel	it could
2011-05-13T15:10:00.000Z	quiescens	fdel	it is probably sending numpad pageup instead of the other pageup
2011-05-13T15:12:00.000Z	fdel	quiescens	odd it works in FF/man/less, but not in terminals (even pseudo ones)
2011-05-13T15:12:00.000Z	quiescens	fdel	less is just picking it up as a regular page up, with no shift
2011-05-13T15:13:00.000Z	fdel	quiescens	so PgUp is recognized but not Shift + PgUp?
2011-05-13T15:13:00.000Z	fdel		Anyway to verify that?
2011-05-13T15:14:00.000Z	quiescens	fdel	less has a binding for its own scrolling using page up and page down, as well as arrow keys etc, shift-pageup if it was working, wouldn't be handled by less, it is handled at tty level, not at software level
2011-05-13T15:17:00.000Z	quiescens	fdel	you can probably play around with loadkeys and kernel keymaps to make it work, i'll have a quick look
2011-05-13T15:25:00.000Z	quiescens	fdel	are you still there?
2011-05-13T15:25:00.000Z	fdel	quiescens	yes
