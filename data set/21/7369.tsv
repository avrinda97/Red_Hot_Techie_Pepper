2007-01-17T09:17:00.000Z	brussel		Why is it that my edgy eft desktop doesn't keep the time syncd despite it being checked to "keep clock synchronized with internet servers"?
2007-01-17T09:18:00.000Z	brussel		i have to disable that check box and press synchonize now to make the time correct?
2007-01-17T06:20:00.000Z	brussel		Anybody here?
2007-01-17T06:22:00.000Z	brussel		I was writing a wiki and now I have a msg at the top saying it should be moved to https://help.ubuntu.com/community where other people would not be able to modify it. I disagree. Am I going to be forced to do that?
2007-01-17T06:22:00.000Z	brussel		I was writing a wiki at the ubuntu site https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ and now I have a msg at the top saying it should be moved to https://help.ubuntu.com/community where other people would not be able to modify it. I disagree. Am I going to be forced to do that?
2007-01-17T06:23:00.000Z	mooey	brussel	i think community given documentation should go in /community, it allows others to edit it so i dont think it should be telling you the opposite :-)
2007-01-17T06:25:00.000Z	brussel	mooey	i'm confused, the wiki is where everybody can update it and is where it is currently. /community is where they are telling me to put it and that seems to be static.
2007-01-17T06:26:00.000Z	mooey	brussel	are you logged in? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ -> this isn't static
2007-01-17T06:27:00.000Z	brussel		hmmm, ok, i'll check it out.
2007-01-17T06:27:00.000Z	mooey	brussel	i hope you can sort it. thanks for contributing :-)
2007-01-17T06:28:00.000Z	brussel	mooey	why would they want to take it away from the obvious place, the wiki, where everybody instinctively knows they can change it?
2007-01-17T06:29:00.000Z	brussel		i go to community and it looks like a mess and it's not even obvious i can sign in
2007-01-17T06:30:00.000Z	mooey	brussel	i'm not sure. i can edit pages on wiki.ubuntu.com. i've got a suspicion it has something todo with signing the ubuntu code of conduct but i could be wrong?
2007-01-17T06:32:00.000Z	brussel	mooey	again i'm confused. wiki.ubuntu.com is fine and is where i am writing the documentation and is the natural place in my mind to add user supplied documentation.
2007-01-17T06:33:00.000Z	brussel	mooey	they however say: This document should be moved to the documentation wiki at https://help.ubuntu.com/community
2007-01-17T06:33:00.000Z	mooey	brussel	i'm confuzzled to. what page are you editing?
2007-01-17T06:34:00.000Z	brussel	mooey	reading the paste just now i see my error, there is some wiki somewhere else besides https://wiki.ubuntu.com/...
2007-01-17T06:35:00.000Z	brussel	mooey	i'll poke around at https://help.ubuntu.com/community until i find a wiki there...
2007-01-17T06:35:00.000Z	mooey	brussel	help.ubuntu.com/community is a wiki o_O
2007-01-17T06:36:00.000Z	brussel	mooey	oh, silly me, didn't see wiki in it's url so assumed it was static.
2007-01-17T06:36:00.000Z	mooey	brussel	ah :-)
