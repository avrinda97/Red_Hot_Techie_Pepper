2008-04-22T06:20:00.000Z	bouma		hello, when im in natuilus, it says i dont have permission to mount a particular partition, but it wont give me an option to type my pword either
2008-04-22T06:20:00.000Z	bouma		i could sudo mount it from a command line, but whats the correct way to use the gui to get 'hal' or something to do it for me ??
2008-04-22T06:21:00.000Z	bouma		btw its been mounting it fine reciently
2008-04-22T06:21:00.000Z	sean_	bouma	sudo nautilus?
2008-04-22T06:21:00.000Z	bouma	sean_	hrm ok
2008-04-22T06:21:00.000Z	sean_		sorry. :P
2008-04-22T06:23:00.000Z	bouma	sean_	ah, it seems its cause the last time i used windows i just used the hardware reset button and its marked dirty
2008-04-22T06:23:00.000Z	bouma	sean_	would have been nice the get a msg to that effect without having to run a console and sudo nautilus :)
2008-04-22T06:23:00.000Z	bouma	sean_	i wonder if there is a bug about that
2008-04-22T06:24:00.000Z	bouma	sean_	i should just reboot into windows and shutdown properly then i suppose
2008-04-22T06:24:00.000Z	sean_	bouma	yeah that'll work. I had the same problem a while ago.
2008-04-22T06:25:00.000Z	bouma	sean_	also whereas i normally get the pasword dialog in this case my user was just getting a.. you dont have permission msg, and no explaination so i think the interface/behaviour is not optimal
2008-04-22T06:25:00.000Z	sean_		Right now my /media/sda6 is being labeled as "z_h_6 jb" and I have absolutely no idea how to fix it. When I check the label it's "MUSIC" correctly, but that doesn't display. Anyone have any ideas?
2008-04-22T06:25:00.000Z	sean_	bouma	that'd definitely be a nice feature
2008-04-22T06:32:00.000Z	sean_		Right now my /media/sda6 is being labeled as "z_h_6 jb" and it should be labelled "MUSIC". It says MUSIC when I check it in the terminal, it's just not displayed. Anyone have any ideas?
2008-04-22T07:10:00.000Z	bouma		i just installed a comercial program which wanted some shared libs.. then i added the lib path to /etc/ld.so.conf.d/afile.conf, how do i relode ld.so.cache ?
2008-04-22T07:11:00.000Z	bouma		how do i reload ld.so.cache ?
2008-04-22T07:12:00.000Z	bouma		ive been googling, but how do i reload ld.so.cache after manually adding a libpath to ld.so.conf
2008-04-22T07:22:00.000Z	bouma	sean_	well when i run, ldconfig -v, it lists all the .so's including the path i just added but for some reason its not picking up so i needed
2008-04-22T07:22:00.000Z	bouma	sean_	any suggestion ?
2008-04-22T07:23:00.000Z	bouma	sean_	ldconfig -v, does list all so's ?
