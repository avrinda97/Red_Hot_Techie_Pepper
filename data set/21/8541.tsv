2006-03-26T13:26:00.000Z	xukun	SeAcabo	?
2006-03-26T13:31:00.000Z	SeAcabo	xukun	you have to test where the device is connect (on which port)
2006-03-26T13:32:00.000Z	SeAcabo	xukun	btw don't make it so difficult in most cases it is /dev/USB0 or /dev/USB1
2006-03-26T13:37:00.000Z	xukun	SeAcabo	How do I see which usb port its connected?
2006-03-26T13:40:00.000Z	xukun		How can I see which usb port my smartphone is connected to?

2006-03-26T13:48:00.000Z	SeAcabo	xukun	it's quite a lot of stuff and i only found a german hwto
2006-03-26T13:50:00.000Z	SeAcabo	xukun	whatever you will need following packages: multisync libmultisync-plugin-evolution synce-multisync-plugin
2006-03-26T13:50:00.000Z	SeAcabo	xukun	install all the packages wit apt-get (i hope you already have a working kernel for this usecase)
2006-03-26T13:52:00.000Z	SeAcabo	xukun	find out on which serial port your smartphone is with the command: pilot-link
2006-03-26T13:52:00.000Z	SeAcabo	xukun	u will need the package pilot-link
2006-03-26T13:53:00.000Z	SeAcabo		just wirte the adress pilot-link gives you in your configuration and everything is fine ;)
2006-03-26T13:54:00.000Z	SeAcabo	xukun	i found it at http://www.galileocomputing.de/openbook/ubuntu/ubuntu_4_007.htm if u speak german u will be fine with this howto
