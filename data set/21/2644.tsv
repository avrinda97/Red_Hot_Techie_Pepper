2009-08-23T08:00:00.000Z	mnaines		Anyone want a good setup for speed and security?
2009-08-23T08:01:00.000Z	mnaines		Easy...External Serial ATA hard drives
2009-08-23T08:01:00.000Z	mnaines		Put all the mission critical data on the eSATA drives, then unmount them and physically secure them when you're away from the computer
2009-08-23T08:02:00.000Z	mnaines		eSATA has a sustained buffer-to-host speed of 300 megabytes per second
2009-08-23T08:02:00.000Z	mnaines		That happens
2009-08-23T08:03:00.000Z	mnaines		Good thing about the external drives is if the drive goes bad, just pry open the case, take out the old drive, buy an internal drive, and swap it into the case
2009-08-23T08:03:00.000Z	mnaines		The only two external hard drive brands I would recommend are Western Digital and Seagate
2009-08-23T08:04:00.000Z	mnaines		Preferably Seagate if you want maximum speed and maximum reliability
2009-08-23T08:04:00.000Z	RHorse	mnaines	datastor has been good for me
2009-08-23T08:05:00.000Z	mnaines	RHorse	use what works best for you.  The point I'm trying to make is that external hard drives, if you use the eSATA interface, are both extremely fast and very secure
2009-08-23T08:06:00.000Z	RHorse	mnaines	eSATA, huh? OK
2009-08-23T08:06:00.000Z	mnaines		eSATA is just regular Serial ATA mounted externally...Same 300 megabytes per second sustained throughput as regular Serial ATA
2009-08-23T08:08:00.000Z	RHorse	mnaines	wow, the last serial drive I mounted externally was years ago, and it sucked. Glad to hear they have something else that works
2009-08-23T08:08:00.000Z	mnaines	RHorse	only difference between eSATA and regular SATA is the interface connection.  Other than that, there is no difference between the two
2009-08-23T08:09:00.000Z	mnaines	RHorse	you must have tried a SCSI drive, am I right?
2009-08-23T08:10:00.000Z	RHorse	mnaines	yes, now that I think of it, I think it was. 7-8 years ago.
2009-08-23T08:10:00.000Z	mnaines	RHorse	yeah...SCSI drives are small in size but easily outpace SATA
2009-08-23T08:11:00.000Z	mnaines	RHorse	Today's SCSI can run 640 megabytes per second sustained while SATA can only do 300 megabytes per second sustained
2009-08-23T08:12:00.000Z	mnaines	RHorse	the SCSI drives don't get bigger than 128GB before they get into the thousand-dollar range
2009-08-23T08:12:00.000Z	RHorse	mnaines	yes, SCSI never acheived mass market acceptance, but the pros all use them big time.
2009-08-23T08:13:00.000Z	mnaines	RHorse	yes.  I use nothing but Serial ATA drives...Even the DVD burner drive I use is SATA
