2009-09-15T22:51:00.000Z	shane2peru		nobody knows about nfs?  and how to bind it to specific ports?
2009-09-15T22:53:00.000Z	K7522	shane2peru	I know that it uses ports 2049/tcp 2049/udp but as for binding them elsewhere I don't know.
2009-09-15T22:53:00.000Z	shane2peru	K7522	well, on the surface it appears to use those ports, but when it comes down to it, other ports are involved and it is random for security
2009-09-15T22:54:00.000Z	shane2peru	K7522	I need to bind them so I can have an iptables firewall
2009-09-15T22:56:00.000Z	shane2peru	K7522	running rpcinfo -p will reveal the ports involved, however after a reboot, they are different, it is the nlock and mountd?  or something like that.
2009-09-15T22:56:00.000Z	K7522	shane2peru	tryin to sort it out, don't use nfs much.
2009-09-15T22:57:00.000Z	shane2peru	K7522	understood, I'm still learning. :)
2009-09-15T22:59:00.000Z	K7522	shane2peru	http://www.lowth.com/LinWiz/nfs_help.html
2009-09-15T23:01:00.000Z	shane2peru	K7522	nice document, I didn't dig that one up, but it says to edit /etc/init.d/nfslock and I don't have that file
2009-09-15T23:02:00.000Z	K7522	shane2peru	do you have the nfs-utils package installed?
2009-09-15T23:03:00.000Z	shane2peru	K7522	hmm, doesn't seem to be in the repos
2009-09-15T23:04:00.000Z	K7522	shane2peru	that's why you don't have that particular file; you can see what package they are in by looking at the "RPM" column. That package may be depreciated, try editing the rest of the ports and see if you've resolved it.
2009-09-15T23:04:00.000Z	shane2peru	K7522	yeah, I will look through the rest, that is why I was looking for Ubuntu specific instructions.  Thanks for the tip though
2009-09-15T23:04:00.000Z	K7522	shane2peru	actually it looks like most of the rest of it is ntfs-utils. Let me try to dig around some more.
2009-09-15T23:05:00.000Z	K7522	shane2peru	 well that link worked for others somwhere on the ubuntuforums.org site but again, may be depreciated
2009-09-15T23:05:00.000Z	shane2peru	K7522	ok, perhaps your google magic is better than mine. ;)
2009-09-15T23:06:00.000Z	shane2peru	K7522	I dug up this old link: http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-825094.html  and gave it a try, but it didn't seem to help
2009-09-15T23:13:00.000Z	shane2peru	K7522	gotta run for a bit, be back, if you dig something up, please post it here, I will leave this ope.
2009-09-15T23:13:00.000Z	shane2peru	K7522	open*
2009-09-15T23:13:00.000Z	K7522	shane2peru	yep; I found an interesting post here. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=570308 Unfortunately I have to go as well, work stuff
2009-09-15T23:13:00.000Z	K7522	shane2peru	good luck I hope you get it sorted.
