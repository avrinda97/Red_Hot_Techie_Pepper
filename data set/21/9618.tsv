2005-12-02T16:27:00.000Z	C_J_Pro		I don't even use ubuntu atm
2005-12-02T16:28:00.000Z	reiki	C_J_Pro	I installed Ubuntu in August and haven't needed Windows since
2005-12-02T16:28:00.000Z	C_J_Pro		reiki:Right now, I'm installing kubuntu on one of my PCs
2005-12-02T16:28:00.000Z	C_J_Pro		but use Windows on my main one due to the fact that I need to use my composition software all the time
2005-12-02T16:29:00.000Z	reiki	C_J_Pro	understand that I was a tester for MS OSs since pre-95 (back when it was Chicago with Win32C!)

2005-12-02T16:30:00.000Z	C_J_Pro		it is Sibelius
2005-12-02T16:30:00.000Z	C_J_Pro		and Garritan Personal Orchestra
2005-12-02T16:30:00.000Z	C_J_Pro		Garritan, of course, has no open source alternative
2005-12-02T16:30:00.000Z	C_J_Pro	Ratty_	installing via synaptic?
