2006-10-04T06:33:00.000Z	avagant	ellioTb	kde is fun huh?
2006-10-04T06:33:00.000Z	avagant	ellioTb	I just don't think i have the hd for it.
2006-10-04T06:33:00.000Z	ellioTb	avagant	yeah, just wondering if its gonna be too slow on this comp
2006-10-04T06:42:00.000Z	avagant	ellioTb	What about fluxbox?
2006-10-04T06:42:00.000Z	ellioTb	avagant	fluxbox is nice and fast, but i feel lost as hell, and i feel like i'll spend forever messing with it
2006-10-04T06:42:00.000Z	avagant	ellioTb	Don't say that, I was just going to download it.
2006-10-04T06:43:00.000Z	ellioTb	avagant	check it out, it looks really cool and is SUPER fast
2006-10-04T06:43:00.000Z	ellioTb	avagant	i am just too ADD to mess with it to make it just like i want it
2006-10-04T06:43:00.000Z	ellioTb	avagant	the ones i tried worked perfectly
2006-10-04T06:44:00.000Z	ellioTb	avagant	yeah, the menu there will have all the same stuff as in gnome
2006-10-04T06:44:00.000Z	ellioTb	avagant	what do you mean by transfer over
2006-10-04T06:46:00.000Z	avagant	ellioTb	That's what I just did. Haha
2006-10-04T06:47:00.000Z	ellioTb	avagant	check out that fluxbox, if you are into that real hackery simple look, then its for you
2006-10-04T06:51:00.000Z	ellioTb	avagant	did kde run too slow for you?
2006-10-12T07:41:00.000Z	avagant	ellioTb	beat me to it.
