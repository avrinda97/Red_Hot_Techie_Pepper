2008-06-05T15:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	moDumass	define breaks
2008-06-05T15:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	moDumass	you running beryl or any other nonesense like compiz
2008-06-05T15:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	moDumass	is it ok if you kill compiz-fusion?
2008-06-05T15:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	moDumass	then head over to #compiz-fusion and ask in there
2008-06-05T15:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	moDumass	i dont use compiz-fusion so I dont know myself, are you fully updated is all i can suggest
2008-06-05T15:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	moDumass	then i have zero idea, make sure you are have fully updated packages is all i can suggest
2008-07-25T15:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	moDumass	gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-08-16T18:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	moDumass	whats tomboy notes?
2008-08-16T18:31:00.000Z	moDumass	ActionParsnip	if you right click on your panel and go add to panel its one of the cool little apps you can launch from your panel
2008-11-07T17:41:00.000Z	moDumass	ActionParsnip	i checked xorg.conf no changes
2008-11-07T17:45:00.000Z	moDumass	ActionParsnip	hmm, strange my xorg.conf shows the res as 1440x900 as an option
2009-06-16T17:38:00.000Z	moDumass	ActionParsnip	if i use a install cd, can i reset my install to a default install?
2009-06-16T17:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	moDumass	you can bot to recovery root console and rename the .gnome folder, that will reset gnome back to defaults if thats what you mean
2009-06-16T17:40:00.000Z	moDumass	ActionParsnip	its more that things that used to work quickly now do not
2009-06-16T17:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	moDumass	then you can run: sudo apt-get --reinstall install ubuntu-desktop    which will reinstall all the apps that make up the desktop and will give them fresh configs (except what is configured in ~)
2009-06-16T17:42:00.000Z	moDumass	ActionParsnip	thanks, il give that a whirl.
2009-06-16T17:43:00.000Z	moDumass	ActionParsnip	i installed ubuntu on an eepc, it has a 4gig and an 8gig flash drive/s problem is that now that i have it going i cant do system upgrades or distro upgrades because it runs out of space
2009-06-16T17:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	moDumass	sudo apt-get clean first
2009-06-16T17:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	moDumass	or skim some packages out that are bulky (open office and gimp will give you a fair chunk of space, if you need word processing install abiword)
2009-06-16T17:45:00.000Z	moDumass	ActionParsnip	thanks for that
