2011-05-31T13:11:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	tanath	ok, so wine :)
2011-05-31T13:11:00.000Z	tanath	MonkeyDust	yeah. asked in #winehq, but no one's talking in there
2011-05-31T13:12:00.000Z	tanath	MonkeyDust	when i run it while system is running it detects a couple things, but can't finish
2011-05-31T13:12:00.000Z	tanath	MonkeyDust	now if i can get it working from live disc i should be good
2011-05-31T13:12:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	tanath	i do not have wine installed, maybe someone else can help
2011-05-31T13:15:00.000Z	tanath	MonkeyDust	yeah. one of the better malware scanners for windows
2011-05-31T13:15:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	tanath	linux has clam av
2011-05-31T13:16:00.000Z	tanath	MonkeyDust	indeed, but in my experience it never finds anything even when there's something to be found
2011-05-31T13:16:00.000Z	tanath	MonkeyDust	only thing clam ever found for me was EICAR

2011-05-31T13:18:00.000Z	tanath	MonkeyDust	thanks, i suppose i can give them a try, but i still want to get this working
2011-05-31T13:21:00.000Z	tanath	MonkeyDust	the top download there is non-existent yet, and the 2nd one is one of the few worth looking at, but isn't free
2011-05-31T13:23:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	tanath	try Xbill => "Get rid of those Wingdows Viruses!"
2011-05-31T13:24:00.000Z	tanath	MonkeyDust	o_O
2011-06-02T03:40:00.000Z	tanath	MonkeyDust	yeah, lots of games :P
2011-06-02T03:40:00.000Z	tanath	MonkeyDust	alien area and all that take up a fair bit of space
