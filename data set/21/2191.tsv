2010-08-25T09:21:00.000Z	Flannel	collabra	pie_time: actually, they're not very different at all.
2010-08-25T09:21:00.000Z	collabra	Flannel	they are certainly different configs and packages
2010-08-25T09:22:00.000Z	Flannel	collabra	They have different default kernels, and the desktop version has more packages installed by default.  That's the extent of their differences.
2010-08-25T09:22:00.000Z	collabra	Flannel	sure they use the same repos but as far as what is installed,... please ,... very different.
2010-08-25T09:23:00.000Z	Flannel	collabra	No, the desktop version has ubuntu-desktop installed, along with a handful of other metapackages, and that's it.
2010-08-25T09:24:00.000Z	collabra	Flannel	when i installed ubuntu-server 9.04,... you couldn't even load a GUI desktop,... but, SURE , not very different at all... lol
2010-08-25T09:25:00.000Z	Flannel	collabra	That's merely default packages, like I said.  You can easily give it a gui with `sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop`.
2010-08-25T09:25:00.000Z	collabra	Flannel	not with ubuntu-server 9.04,...
2010-08-25T09:25:00.000Z	Flannel	collabra	Yes, even with Ubuntu server 9.04
2010-08-25T09:26:00.000Z	collabra	Flannel	the repos aren't there
2010-08-25T09:26:00.000Z	collabra	Flannel	no they're not.
2010-08-25T09:27:00.000Z	Flannel	collabra	Jaunty is still supported, and the repositories are still there.
2010-08-25T09:28:00.000Z	Flannel	collabra	Please stop that.
2010-08-25T09:29:00.000Z	collabra	Flannel	please stop what you're saying too.
2010-08-25T09:32:00.000Z	Flannel	collabra	No.  There's no GUI by default, but it's trivial to add one if you'd like.
2010-08-25T09:32:00.000Z	collabra	Flannel	as of 9.04 there is no option for a GUI
2010-08-25T09:32:00.000Z	Flannel	collabra	Not during the installer, after you've finished installing.  You just add one from the repositories.
2010-08-25T09:33:00.000Z	collabra	Flannel	you'll have to add the repos.... cause you won't find them on the default install,... ????!!!!????
2010-08-25T09:33:00.000Z	Flannel	collabra	When you installed, was your machine connected to the internet?
2010-08-25T09:34:00.000Z	Flannel	collabra	If it isn't, the installer will comment out the repositories in your sources.list.
2010-08-25T09:34:00.000Z	collabra	Flannel	great,... what did i say ? .... I'm so through with you.
