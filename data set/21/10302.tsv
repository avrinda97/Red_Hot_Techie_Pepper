2005-04-08T05:45:00.000Z	Pizbit	crocco	Could be you didn't add the respository properly(ie, missed out something equivelent to universe/mqain/etc), or they just don't have all the E packages?
2005-04-08T05:46:00.000Z	crocco	Pizbit	doubt that too, as then apt would complain ... and give an error message .. and the line simply is well formed .. deb http://www.soulmachine.net/debian unstable-20050215/
2005-04-08T05:46:00.000Z	crocco	Pizbit	check out the repos they DEFINATELY have everything packaged and in the Packages file also
2005-04-08T05:53:00.000Z	Pizbit	crocco	Is it just me, or are they not listed here? http://www.soulmachine.net/debian/unstable-20050215/Packages

2005-04-08T05:56:00.000Z	Pizbit	crocco	What you could always do is download the packages straight from that address and then dpkg -i package1 package2 etc:)
