2007-01-19T07:21:00.000Z	Monika|K	gaspipe1	I am
2007-01-19T07:21:00.000Z	Monika|K	gaspipe1	what question do you have?
2007-01-19T07:22:00.000Z	Monika|K	gaspipe1	I suggest you just go ahead and ask the question in the channel, someone will probably help you then, maybe me if I know the answer
2007-01-19T07:34:00.000Z	Monika|K	gaspipe1	that doesn't make much sense, F: is what Windows calls it
2007-01-19T07:30:00.000Z	Monika|K	gaspipe1	why do you want swap on F:? Do you realize that swap is only double the size of your RAM, e.g. 1 Gig if you have 512 MB RAM
2007-01-19T07:32:00.000Z	Monika|K	gaspipe1	are E: and F: separate hard disks or are they partitions on one hard disk?
2007-01-19T07:32:00.000Z	Monika|K	gaspipe1	what did you mean bei "500 mg"?
2007-01-19T07:34:00.000Z	Monika|K	gaspipe1	are you using the Live-CD or the Alternate CD?
2007-01-19T07:36:00.000Z	Monika|K	gaspipe1	on the live CD have you used gParted? Could you deal with that?
2007-01-19T07:37:00.000Z	Monika|K	gaspipe1	yes
2007-01-19T07:38:00.000Z	Monika|K	gaspipe1	it's pretty intuitive to use ... and there is probably instructions in the wiki
