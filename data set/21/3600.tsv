2009-01-05T14:32:00.000Z	Lo_		with last update my wine "is broken" I'm using ubuntu 8.10
2009-01-05T14:32:00.000Z	rww	Lo_	elaborate on "is broken", please
2009-01-05T14:33:00.000Z	Lo_	rww	No application (which worked) does now, if I try to launch winecfhg I get the following error: wine: Unhandled page fault on read access to 0x00000004 at address 0x455410 (thread 0014), starting debugger...
2009-01-05T14:35:00.000Z	Lo_	rww	also if I try to do wine anyprogram.exe from a terminal I get the error: wine: Unhandled page fault on read access to 0x00000004 at address 0x455410 (thread 0014), starting debugger...
2009-01-05T14:36:00.000Z	rww	Lo_	I'm looking for solutions. Give me a sec :)
2009-01-05T14:36:00.000Z	Lo_	rww	Thanks a lot!! :)
2009-01-05T14:38:00.000Z	rww	Lo_	what version of Ubuntu are you using?
2009-01-05T14:39:00.000Z	Lo_	rww	8.10
2009-01-05T14:39:00.000Z	Lo_	rww	Unfortunately it seems to be a quite widespread problem in wine 1.1.12: http://forum.winehq.org/viewtopic.php?p=17490&sid=590335c11cd63963d620b072678d5c30
2009-01-05T14:40:00.000Z	rww	Lo_	Intrepid's only up to 1.0.1 right now, though, unless you installed it manually.
2009-01-05T14:40:00.000Z	Lo_	rww	no... I mean it was installed automatically..
2009-01-05T14:40:00.000Z	rww	Lo_	try "mv ~/.wine ~/.wine_old". That'll move your wine configuration out of the way and make a new one. Try running winecfg again after that.
2009-01-05T14:42:00.000Z	rww	Lo_	that'll tell us whether something's wrong with your copy of wine, or with your wine configuration; and you can move it back again with "rm -r ~/.wine; mv ~/.wine_old ~/.wine"
2009-01-05T14:43:00.000Z	Lo_	rww	Ok, now winecfg and wine seem to work..
2009-01-05T14:43:00.000Z	Lo_	rww	but how to "restore" my programs?
2009-01-05T14:43:00.000Z	rww	Lo_	okay, so something is screwy with your .wine directory... hmm.
2009-01-05T14:44:00.000Z	Lo_	rww	Yes. definitly
2009-01-05T14:44:00.000Z	rww	Lo_	I'd recommend going into #winehq and telling them about it. They know way more about this than me...
2009-01-05T14:45:00.000Z	rww	Lo_	like I said, though, to restore your old configuration, remove the new one: "rm -r ~/.wine" and move the old one back: "mv ~/.wine_old ~/.wine"
2009-01-05T14:45:00.000Z	Lo_	rww	Thank you so much.
2009-01-05T14:45:00.000Z	Lo_	rww	I'll check that out.. anyway thanks for putting me on the right track ;)
