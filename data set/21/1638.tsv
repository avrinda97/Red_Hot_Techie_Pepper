2010-08-15T16:42:00.000Z	lhavelund		So, I'm in a minor pickle. How can I, with the ftp program in Ubuntu, copy whole folders (including subfolders and dotfiles, etc.) across to a remote host?
2010-08-15T16:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lhavelund	 you mean the command line ftp?
2010-08-15T16:42:00.000Z	lhavelund	Dr_Willis	Correct.
2010-08-15T16:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lhavelund	 theres some options to do it.. last i used that was years and years ago..  somthing to watch out for are permissions and ownerships getting lost. You may want to 'tar' the stuff first.
2010-08-15T16:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lhavelund	 i cant recall the recursive 'put' option for ftp really.. I much perfer scp thesed ays
2010-08-15T16:44:00.000Z	lhavelund	Dr_Willis	I'm just trying to copy over an entire /home partition right now; I'm having to re-do my server. I'll gladly have to manually sort out permissions etc. later, but for now, this is all I have.
2010-08-15T16:44:00.000Z	lhavelund	Dr_Willis	And scp isn't an option :(
2010-08-15T16:44:00.000Z	lhavelund	Dr_Willis	I believe it's "mput".
2010-08-15T16:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lhavelund	 Id have to do some googling on it.. its been 10+ yrs :0
2010-08-15T16:44:00.000Z	lhavelund	Dr_Willis	Sheesh.
2010-08-15T16:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lhavelund	 or use a gui to ftp :) if cli only 'mc' can do it...  been ages sicne i did that also
2010-08-15T16:45:00.000Z	lhavelund	Dr_Willis	I'm just going to check mc's docs; might be a good way to go about it. Thanks!
2010-08-15T16:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lhavelund	 yea. i forget how to do ftp in mc also. :) Been too long.
2010-08-15T16:46:00.000Z	lhavelund	Dr_Willis	mc is pretty simple :)
2010-08-15T16:46:00.000Z	lhavelund	Dr_Willis	ftp://user:pass@location, I suppose.
2010-08-15T16:48:00.000Z	lhavelund	Dr_Willis	wput will do it, apparently.
2010-08-15T16:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lhavelund	 a kin to 'wget' ? :)
2010-08-15T16:49:00.000Z	lhavelund	Dr_Willis	Yup! :)
2010-08-15T16:49:00.000Z	lhavelund	Dr_Willis	Clever, eh? ;)
2010-08-15T16:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lhavelund	 never used wput.
2010-08-15T16:49:00.000Z	lhavelund	Dr_Willis	Neither have I.
