2008-04-21T20:42:00.000Z	mavsman4457		Hi I'm having difficulties with my screen resolution
2008-04-21T20:43:00.000Z	mavsman4457		the only option is 640x480
2008-04-21T20:43:00.000Z	hscade	mavsman4457	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2008-04-21T20:44:00.000Z	mavsman4457	hscade	and then do i have to reboot?
2008-04-21T20:44:00.000Z	hscade	mavsman4457	not realy i think
2008-04-21T20:44:00.000Z	mavsman4457	hscade	because I did that but didn't reboot and I haven't gotten any other extra options
2008-04-21T20:46:00.000Z	mavsman4457	hscade	I have a kind of graphics card that won't support hd output, and Im on an hdtv, but when it was connected to my 19" monitor it worked fine with 1260x1048 or whatever it is
2008-04-21T20:46:00.000Z	mavsman4457		Voidedcheck, just hit control alt backspace while the desktop is up?
2008-04-21T20:46:00.000Z	mavsman4457		Voidedbackspace, or do I have to do it in a termianl or something
2008-04-21T20:47:00.000Z	hscade	mavsman4457	mh why would you use hdtv O_O
2008-04-21T20:47:00.000Z	mavsman4457	hscade	cause that's the only monito that is available
2008-04-21T20:47:00.000Z	mavsman4457	hscade	and I think I want to play games on it
2008-04-21T20:48:00.000Z	hscade	mavsman4457	google would help ?
2008-04-21T20:49:00.000Z	mavsman4457	hscade	didn't find much, I figured this would be a better place for help
2008-04-21T20:49:00.000Z	hscade	mavsman4457	mh can't help u with hdtv :/
2008-04-21T20:50:00.000Z	mavsman4457	hscade	I don't even need it to fit my hdtv I just want it to be any resolution higher than 640x480 because that is just unbearable
2008-04-21T20:51:00.000Z	hscade	mavsman4457	wait i've an idea!
2008-04-21T20:54:00.000Z	hscade	mavsman4457	sudo nano -w /etc/X11/xorg.conf  after adding your needed attributes you should restart xserver
2008-04-21T20:55:00.000Z	mavsman4457	hscade	thank you, I'm not on my ubuntu box right now because 640x480 is unbearable but I will try that once I get back onto it
2008-04-21T20:55:00.000Z	hscade		mh smartctl says  my secondary hdd is available
2008-04-21T20:55:00.000Z	hscade	mavsman4457	good luck
