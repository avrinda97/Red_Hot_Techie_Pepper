2010-11-17T04:23:00.000Z	r007	SharkWipf	what did you use to update?
2010-11-17T04:14:00.000Z	SharkWipf	r007	Elpasmo tries to get his ubuntu to boot ^^
2010-11-17T04:14:00.000Z	SharkWipf	r007	see http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1584732
2010-11-17T04:16:00.000Z	SharkWipf	r007	at what point exactly (topic is mine btw =)
2010-11-17T04:17:00.000Z	SharkWipf	r007	I had the same problem, and installed the drivers over and over, in tons of ways, to no avail
2010-11-17T04:17:00.000Z	r007	SharkWipf	as soon as you pass post hit esc and the grub menu should display then you can select the earlier kernel
2010-11-17T04:18:00.000Z	SharkWipf	r007	there was no earlier kernel. In that topic I thought I installed an update, but I mislooked, and only core-utils was updated
2010-11-17T04:19:00.000Z	r007	SharkWipf	ubuntu usually stores the last 2 kernels and leaves entries in the grub menu for them
2010-11-17T04:20:00.000Z	SharkWipf	r007	it was a brand new laptop, so I didn't have any older kernels. neither does ElPasmo, I believe
2010-11-17T04:20:00.000Z	r007	SharkWipf	you said in the post you updated the kernel
2010-11-17T04:20:00.000Z	SharkWipf	r007	yes, but it turned out to just be an update for bin-utils. I overlooked it
2010-11-17T04:21:00.000Z	SharkWipf	r007	I just installed all drivers and updates after a fresh boot
2010-11-17T04:22:00.000Z	SharkWipf	r007	and I was surprised I needed to reboot after the normal (not videocard) updates
2010-11-17T04:22:00.000Z	r007	SharkWipf	what version of ubuntu are you using and what does cat /proc/version show?
2010-11-17T04:22:00.000Z	r007	SharkWipf	if you had to reboot you have upgraded the kernel I bet
2010-11-17T04:24:00.000Z	SharkWipf	r007	(Un)fortunately I don't have the laptop anymore. I got my money back. So ElPasmo is the only one with the problem now. I couldn't find a kernel update in the logs, and used the default updater, popping up when there are updates (in gnome)
2010-11-17T04:25:00.000Z	r007	SharkWipf	well synamtec will include kernel updates
2010-11-17T04:27:00.000Z	SharkWipf	r007	but it will also show in the synaptic logs, right? and there was no new choice in kernel in the grub menu.
2010-11-17T04:27:00.000Z	r007	SharkWipf	should do yes
2010-11-17T04:28:00.000Z	SharkWipf	r007	also, ElPasmo doesn't have exactly the same laptop, but does have the same problem
2010-11-17T04:29:00.000Z	SharkWipf	r007	(and puddles) : unfortunately I really have to go now... can you take over from me when (/if) ElPasmo comes back?
