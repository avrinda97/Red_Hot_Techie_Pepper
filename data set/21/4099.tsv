2012-05-04T14:54:00.000Z	JonathanEllis		I am having problems with Chromium-browser and google-chrome both crashing on Ubuntu 12.04. Error messages from the terminal are here http://pastebin.com/kmNwGLzj      I googled this problem and found these bugs https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/chromium-browser/+bug/949439     and     http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=101160         I now don't know if this is a problem with chromium, google-chrome, ubuntu.
2012-05-04T14:55:00.000Z	JonathanEllis		I am running chromium-browser version 18.0.1025.151 (Developer Build 130497 Linux) Ubuntu 12.04
2012-05-04T14:56:00.000Z	gaelfx	JonathanEllis	generally, an "undecided, incomplete' bug report is not a good source to go on
2012-05-04T14:56:00.000Z	gaelfx	JonathanEllis	you also need to update your Chromium
2012-05-04T14:57:00.000Z	gaelfx	JonathanEllis	mine is 18.0.1025.168
2012-05-04T14:59:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	gaelfx	Where did you get your updated chromium? I have installed all the updates from the ubuntu repo. Is there another repo I should add or did you build it from source?
2012-05-04T15:00:00.000Z	gaelfx	JonathanEllis	when I installed chromium, it added the google repo, so it updates straight from google. how did you install your chromium?
2012-05-04T15:01:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	gaelfx	From the ubuntu software centre. How did you install yours?
2012-05-04T15:01:00.000Z	gaelfx	JonathanEllis	I installed mine from Software Center
2012-05-04T15:01:00.000Z	gaelfx	JonathanEllis	hang on a sec
2012-05-04T15:02:00.000Z	gaelfx	JonathanEllis	did you try sudo apt-get update?
2012-05-04T15:03:00.000Z	gaelfx	JonathanEllis	sorry, I was wrong, I forgot that I went to chrome.google.com
2012-05-04T15:03:00.000Z	gaelfx	JonathanEllis	try that, it should offer to add itself to the repos
2012-05-04T15:04:00.000Z	gaelfx	JonathanEllis	after you choose the correct settings or w/e it should open up software center for you
2012-05-04T15:07:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	gaelfx	I have the google repo from when I installed google chrome. I will check which version of google-chrome I have
2012-05-04T15:09:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	gaelfx	I have google-chrome 18.0.1025.168 and I was already having this problem. I have added some more update settings to my software sources. I will check for more updates and see if anything offers to update.
2012-05-04T15:10:00.000Z	gaelfx	JonathanEllis	 I had a similar problem a couple days ago, but the most recent update seems to have fixed it. Could you give me a url that crashes so I can test it?
2012-05-04T15:11:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	gaelfx	Its no particular url that crashes it. Sometimes it happens randomly. Usually its when I try to login to google services with multiple sign on.
2012-05-04T15:11:00.000Z	gaelfx	JonathanEllis	ah, that is a scenario I can't test. The GFW generally makes things like that impossible
2012-05-04T15:15:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	gaelfx	Update manager is now installing chromium 18.0.1025.168 so hopefully that might fix it
2012-05-04T15:16:00.000Z	gaelfx	JonathanEllis	probably the same update I put on a couple days ago, let me know if it works
