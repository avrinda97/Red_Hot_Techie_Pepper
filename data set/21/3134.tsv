2009-06-06T17:17:00.000Z	grawity	Tyrath	In Linux, filenames are case-sensitive, so yes, .iso and .ISO are different.
2009-06-06T17:17:00.000Z	Tyrath	grawity	so what's a .ISO file then?
2009-06-06T17:20:00.000Z	grawity	Tyrath	Both .iso and .ISO are okay (but .iso is more convienent). Actually, it may as well be .qwertyuiop, but that isn't very clear.
2009-06-06T17:23:00.000Z	grawity	Tyrath	Maybe Daemon doesn't care about the extension either, and tries all formats known to it? foo.iso might be a NRG or whatever, and it still open.
2009-06-06T17:24:00.000Z	Tyrath	grawity	say it is an NRG, how could I open that?
2009-06-06T17:24:00.000Z	Tyrath	grawity	because i'm picking it's either iso or nrg
2009-06-06T17:24:00.000Z	grawity	Tyrath	I have no idea.... hmm, what 'mount' command were you using last?
2009-06-06T17:25:00.000Z	Tyrath	grawity	sudo mount -o loop blah.iso /mnt/xdrv
2009-06-06T17:26:00.000Z	grawity	Tyrath	mount -t iso9660 -o loop foo.iso /mount/point
2009-06-06T17:26:00.000Z	Tyrath	grawity	already tried that :P
2009-06-06T17:29:00.000Z	grawity	Tyrath	This is unrelated, but why don't you simply quote the filename instead\ of\ escaping\ all\ the\ spaces?
2009-06-06T17:29:00.000Z	Tyrath	grawity	i'll cd to the path then, but i doubt it will make much difference
2009-06-06T17:30:00.000Z	grawity	Tyrath	It shouldn't, it's just easier to type sometimes.
2009-06-06T17:32:00.000Z	grawity	Tyrath	Add an -t iso9660 before the -o
2009-06-06T17:33:00.000Z	Tyrath	grawity	sudo mount -t iso9660 -o loop WarcraftIII.iso /mnt/xdrv/ ---> wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/loop0...
2009-06-06T17:34:00.000Z	grawity	Tyrath	Well it is not iso9660 then? Hmmmm, head -c 1024 WarcraftIII.iso | od -h | curl -F "sprunge=<" sprunge.us
2009-06-06T17:37:00.000Z	Tyrath	grawity	I don't know what that command does but I got this : head: cannot open `WarcraftIII.iso' for reading: No such file or directory
2009-06-06T17:37:00.000Z	Tyrath	grawity	sorry, i was in the wrong directory. I'll try again
2009-06-06T17:38:00.000Z	grawity	Tyrath	Eh, nevermind
2009-06-06T17:38:00.000Z	grawity	Tyrath	that command won't actually do what I thought it does :/
2009-06-06T17:38:00.000Z	Tyrath	grawity	any what the command you specified gave me is : curl: (26) failed creating formpost data
