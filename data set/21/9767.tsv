2005-07-14T05:03:00.000Z	tiglionabbit		well, I'm going to bed.  Wish you all luck with your linuxy thingamabob times
2005-07-14T05:05:00.000Z	tiglionabbit		?
2005-07-14T05:06:00.000Z	thegrok	tiglionabbit	you are one of the developers?
2005-07-14T05:06:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	thegrok	nope, I'm just a guy with too much time on his hands
2005-07-14T05:06:00.000Z	thegrok	tiglionabbit	what makes ubuntu better than debian?
2005-07-14T05:07:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	thegrok	newer packages, simpler interfaces, guis, it's made for the casual desktop user, and uh, nice people!
2005-07-14T05:08:00.000Z	thegrok	tiglionabbit	i'm currently "coming" to you via my ubuntu gateway on my home LAN, every few days my connection slows....and i need to reboot
2005-07-14T05:08:00.000Z	thegrok	tiglionabbit	can't tell if it's gnome or firestarter or the kernel
2005-07-14T05:09:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	thegrok	hmm.  I don't know what the problem is, but it could be with your router or ISP too.  Have you tried resetting your router and modem recently?
2005-07-14T05:10:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	thegrok	that doesn't necessarily mean it's not the modem's fault.  Breaking a connection can have that effect
2005-07-14T05:11:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	thegrok	I would suggest that you look at your ports, and run 'top' to see what processes are running too
2005-07-14T05:11:00.000Z	thegrok	tiglionabbit	will do, takes a few days to replicate...
2005-07-14T05:11:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	thegrok	oh, a few days...  I thought this was more of an immediate problem than that =P
2005-07-14T05:12:00.000Z	thegrok	tiglionabbit	nope few days...hence i suspect something's leaking memory
2005-07-14T05:12:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	thegrok	well, if you suspect that, be sure to run system monitoring programs and look at what eats things up
2005-07-14T05:34:00.000Z	thegrok	tiglionabbit	back, what system monitoring utilities are those?
2005-07-14T05:35:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	thegrok	I just suggested using top, or apps->system tools-> system monitor
2005-07-14T05:37:00.000Z	thegrok	tiglionabbit	ooh much nicer than top....thanks
2005-07-14T05:37:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	thegrok	=p whatchoo talkin about, top is fun too.  lol
