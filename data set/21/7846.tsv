2006-10-16T07:33:00.000Z	davidT		a quickie one
2006-10-16T07:33:00.000Z	davidT		in theory how much would take a fsck of a 200gb ?
2006-10-16T07:33:00.000Z	jelly-home	davidT	how may files?
2006-10-16T07:34:00.000Z	jelly-home		many
2006-10-16T07:35:00.000Z	jelly-home	davidT	how many files?  is it an ext3?  was it mkfs-ed with default options?
2006-10-16T07:35:00.000Z	davidT		a lot of file and a lot of big ones
2006-10-16T07:35:00.000Z	davidT		ext3
2006-10-16T07:35:00.000Z	jelly-home	davidT	by "a lot" do you mean tens of thousands or millions?
2006-10-16T07:35:00.000Z	davidT		no
2006-10-16T07:35:00.000Z	davidT		thousands
2006-10-16T07:35:00.000Z	jelly-home		feh, that's a few.
2006-10-16T07:36:00.000Z	davidT		well it is now more than 24 hours
2006-10-16T07:36:00.000Z	jelly-home	davidT	that's definitely too much for ext3.
2006-10-16T07:37:00.000Z	jelly-home	davidT	did fsck report any errors?
2006-10-16T07:37:00.000Z	davidT		the first time i did with the -a flag
2006-10-16T07:37:00.000Z	jelly-home	davidT	I'd guess maybe 2-3 hours...
2006-10-16T07:37:00.000Z	davidT		it did report errors
2006-10-16T07:38:00.000Z	davidT	ok	so something's wrong
2006-10-16T07:39:00.000Z	davidT		would you stop it ?
2006-10-16T07:39:00.000Z	jelly-home	davidT	of course pasting the last few screenfuls might help to know if they look like benign errors or not.
2006-10-16T08:14:00.000Z	jelly-home	davidT	if it was an ATA disk, i'd check for SMART errors. Could be the hardware is on its way out.  fsck shouldn't take that long anyway,
