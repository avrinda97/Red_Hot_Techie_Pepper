2010-09-22T05:49:00.000Z	ThomasB2k		Hi, I have dual monitors set up. My second monitor is a 30" TV capable of 1920x1080. It's hooked up through a DVI port. The DVI input is on the TV and the HDMI is on my laptop, so I'm using an HDMI to DVI cable. I'm using the proprietary nvidia drivers. In Windows, I can do a resolution of 1920x1080 on it, but in Ubuntu I can only do a resolution of 1360x768. Does anyone have an idea why?
2010-09-22T05:49:00.000Z	SubCool	ThomasB2k	you probably have to set the Resolution manually
2010-09-22T05:50:00.000Z	SubCool		i have been having issues with that too. -
2010-09-22T05:50:00.000Z	SubCool		oh- i dont beleive in paying for things..
2010-09-22T05:50:00.000Z	SubCool		most of it never works..
2010-09-22T05:50:00.000Z	ThomasB2k	SubCool	do you know how I would go about doing that?
2010-09-22T05:50:00.000Z	SubCool		If it works, and i like it. I donate. I like that method.
2010-09-22T05:50:00.000Z	SubCool		uh- kinda..
2010-09-22T05:51:00.000Z	SubCool		not well enough to walk you through it.
2010-09-22T05:51:00.000Z	SubCool		Its kinda easy, just annoying
2010-09-22T05:51:00.000Z	SubCool		For me, i would open/create a xorg.conf file..
2010-09-22T05:51:00.000Z	ThomasB2k	SubCool	is it in a config file or something? I've been using Ubuntu for about a year. If you give me a general idea of how, I could probably figure it out
2010-09-22T05:51:00.000Z	SubCool		i have to create one for my setup, which is where my ATI is annoying.
2010-09-22T05:52:00.000Z	SubCool	ThomasB2k	i have been using int a lot longer, i just dont stick with it enough because it tickes me off too much. In your /etc/X11/ should be a xorg.conf edit it.
2010-09-22T05:52:00.000Z	ThomasB2k		okay
2010-09-22T05:52:00.000Z	SubCool		In there you'll see a section.. Problem is- im use to ati,
2010-09-22T05:53:00.000Z	SubCool		let me see what mines even says. i disconnected the monitor.
2010-09-22T05:53:00.000Z	SubCool		anyone got something for Network Traffic MOnitor - i just wanna see the KB/s
2010-09-22T05:54:00.000Z	SubCool	ThomasB2k	Ya, mines all f;ed up- i cant use it to compare.
2010-09-22T05:55:00.000Z	SubCool		I was havinig a lot of issues with Kubuntu confusing which monitor was primpary.. ugh
2010-09-22T05:55:00.000Z	SubCool	ThomasB2k	either way, ur going to have a Screen0 and Screen1 i suppose. if it is already filled it, you can just edit the resolution yourself.
