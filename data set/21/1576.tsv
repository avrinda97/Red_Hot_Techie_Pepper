2010-08-04T01:08:00.000Z	Zeus__	rhodan	I have the same problem when i try to use the entire disk.
2010-08-04T01:09:00.000Z	rhodan	Zeus__	We already had that one today.

2010-08-04T01:19:00.000Z	Zeus__	rhodan	I tried g-parted and it says that it cannot detect any devices. Again, I can boot the live CD and everything seems fine. Any ideas?
2010-08-04T01:20:00.000Z	rhodan	Zeus__	fdisk -l
2010-08-04T01:21:00.000Z	rhodan	Zeus__	Don't listen to him
2010-08-04T01:24:00.000Z	rhodan	Zeus__	So the live CD detects the disk but the other system does not?
