2009-08-08T06:00:00.000Z	DarthPuff		hello
2009-08-08T06:00:00.000Z	DarthPuff		i just installed ubuntu, but i cannot click on any of the panels
2009-08-08T06:00:00.000Z	DarthPuff		how do i install the nvidia drivers from the console?
2009-08-08T06:01:00.000Z	bastidrazor	DarthPuff	 try to run gksudo jockey-gtk  .. that is the restricted drivers manager.
2009-08-08T06:01:00.000Z	DarthPuff	bastidrazor	ok, alt-f2 then type that in?
2009-08-08T06:01:00.000Z	bastidrazor	DarthPuff	yes
2009-08-08T06:01:00.000Z	DarthPuff	bastidrazor	i cannot even bring up a run prompt
2009-08-08T06:02:00.000Z	DarthPuff	bastidrazor	the video drivers are really messing up
2009-08-08T06:02:00.000Z	DarthPuff		i have another question
2009-08-08T06:02:00.000Z	DarthPuff		how do i disable bluetooth from trying to startup at boot?
2009-08-08T06:03:00.000Z	bastidrazor	DarthPuff	which video card? i'll see which driver it may want to install for a manual install
2009-08-08T06:03:00.000Z	DarthPuff	bastidrazor	geforce gts 250
2009-08-08T06:03:00.000Z	DarthPuff	bastidrazor	after the 184 updates install
2009-08-08T06:04:00.000Z	DarthPuff	bastidrazor	i'll restart xserver
2009-08-08T06:04:00.000Z	bastidrazor	DarthPuff	yeah, finish those updates before doing any other driver installs. that may get things working enough to use the GUI.
2009-08-08T06:05:00.000Z	DarthPuff	bastidrazor	i'll have to reboot
2009-08-08T06:05:00.000Z	DarthPuff		because it installed a new kernel
2009-08-08T06:05:00.000Z	bastidrazor	DarthPuff	just in case it seems 'nvidia-glx-180'  is the driver you'll be needing
2009-08-08T06:05:00.000Z	DarthPuff	bastidrazor	ok, i'll apt-get install that :)
2009-08-08T06:06:00.000Z	DarthPuff		after i am in the new kernel
2009-08-08T06:06:00.000Z	bastidrazor	DarthPuff	yeah, if the GUI is usable after the reboot use the hardware drivers manager. it will do it all for you with just a click.
