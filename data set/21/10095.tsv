2005-05-13T09:04:00.000Z	osity		I read that hoary  supports raid1  right from the install.....Does that mean that all I have to do is install the raid option with 2 drives in it and they raid?
2005-05-13T09:04:00.000Z	osity		software
2005-05-13T09:05:00.000Z	spartacus	osity	pretty much. not sure how it handles booting on raid tho?
2005-05-13T09:05:00.000Z	spartacus	osity	3ware is very good value for that
2005-05-13T09:06:00.000Z	spartacus	osity	they start at 127 usd on newegg.com
2005-05-13T09:07:00.000Z	osity	spartacus	at 127 you may get a card but I doubt its hardware raid...
2005-05-13T09:09:00.000Z	spartacus	osity	247 gets a better one, but the 127 usd card is simple hardware raid too.
2005-05-13T09:09:00.000Z	spartacus	osity	it's not promise style raid
2005-05-13T09:10:00.000Z	osity	spartacus	what do you mean promise style?
2005-05-13T09:10:00.000Z	spartacus	osity	i mean, dodgy software raid
2005-05-13T09:12:00.000Z	osity	spartacus	I found one on new egg for 459.00
2005-05-13T09:12:00.000Z	spartacus	osity	http://www2.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16816116030
2005-05-13T09:13:00.000Z	osity	spartacus	I need IDE ...that sure looks like a software solution ....there is no CPU...

2005-05-13T09:15:00.000Z	osity	spartacus	dud that thing is a controller.
2005-05-13T09:16:00.000Z	spartacus	osity	yeh? you said you needed ide?
2005-05-13T09:17:00.000Z	osity	spartacus	so where is the cPU?
2005-05-13T09:17:00.000Z	spartacus	osity	so you want software raid? that thing is an ide raid controller. plug the drives into the card, and it looks like a single scsi disk, and the card manages the drives
2005-05-13T09:17:00.000Z	spartacus	osity	on both of those cards, it's the big 3ware chip in the middle
2005-05-13T09:23:00.000Z	osity	spartacus	are you using raid on Ubuntu?
2005-05-13T09:23:00.000Z	spartacus	osity	no, it's on Adamantix... another Debian based distro
