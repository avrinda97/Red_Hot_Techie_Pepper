2006-10-18T09:46:00.000Z	fredl		Grrr, can anybody help me with this: http://pastebin.ca/208339
2006-10-18T09:47:00.000Z	variant	fredl	ahh, it was you :)
2006-10-18T09:47:00.000Z	fredl	variant	huh?
2006-10-18T09:47:00.000Z	variant	fredl	have you tried apt-get installing one of those unmet dependancies?
2006-10-18T09:47:00.000Z	variant	fredl	i had the link open but couldnt remember who had the problem :P
2006-10-18T09:48:00.000Z	fredl	variant	I think apt should do that by itself right?
2006-10-18T09:48:00.000Z	fredl	variant	I mean, that's what apt is for... :)
2006-10-18T09:48:00.000Z	variant	fredl	yes, somtimes dependancies become brokenthough
2006-10-18T09:48:00.000Z	fredl	variant	yes that's because I removed one line from my sources.list I think
2006-10-18T09:48:00.000Z	fredl	variant	and I have after that apt-get update'd
2006-10-18T09:49:00.000Z	fredl	variant	but it still seems to 'know' something about it though.
2006-10-18T09:49:00.000Z	variant	fredl	try apt-get install php5-common
2006-10-18T09:50:00.000Z	variant	fredl	apt-get remove it, then rerun the original command that you are having the problem with
2006-10-18T09:50:00.000Z	variant	fredl	apt-get remove php5-common
2006-10-18T09:50:00.000Z	variant	fredl	then apt-get install php5-gd
2006-10-18T09:52:00.000Z	fredl	variant	I tried dpkg --purge php5-common but that won't work unless I do a force. When I try to apt-get remove php5-common, it wants to remove a whole slew of other packages.
2006-10-18T09:52:00.000Z	variant	fredl	hmm thats a problem
2006-10-18T10:06:00.000Z	variant	fredl	yes
2006-10-18T10:16:00.000Z	variant	fredl	you can turn it off
2006-10-18T10:16:00.000Z	fredl	variant	I know but I always forget.
2006-10-18T10:16:00.000Z	variant	fredl	personly i like it :)
