2009-11-24T21:36:00.000Z	isolat3dsh33p		 guys, how do i know which whether my Fx is 64-bit Fx or 32-bit Fx?
2009-11-24T21:36:00.000Z	maco	isolat3dsh33p	Fx?
2009-11-24T21:36:00.000Z	isolat3dsh33p	maco	firefox
2009-11-24T21:36:00.000Z	maco	isolat3dsh33p	if youre using 32bit ubuntu it's 32bit firefox. if its 64bit ubuntu, it's 64bit firefox
2009-11-24T21:37:00.000Z	isolat3dsh33p	maco	I just want to make sure since youtube playbacks is not working on my browser
2009-11-24T21:38:00.000Z	maco	isolat3dsh33p	install flashplugin-nonfree and restart your browser
2009-11-24T21:39:00.000Z	isolat3dsh33p	maco	I've intalled flash, I got the sound and video, but left clicks don't work. Or flashplugin-nonfree is another thing :/
2009-11-24T21:40:00.000Z	maco	isolat3dsh33p	ooooo ok thats a known bug
2009-11-24T21:40:00.000Z	maco	isolat3dsh33p	i think it only happens if you use compiz, right? im trying to remember as i dont hit it. i think you need to hold shift or ctrl while clicking
2009-11-24T21:40:00.000Z	isolat3dsh33p	maco	ok, i'll try it. :D
2009-11-24T21:44:00.000Z	isolat3dsh33p	maco	it's actually the left and middle click at the same time. It works, few times. Thanks anyway.
2010-01-07T14:31:00.000Z	maco	isolat3dsh33p	careful youre not thinking of AWN ;)
2010-01-07T14:31:00.000Z	isolat3dsh33p	maco	LOL, what's WM anyway? D:
2010-01-07T14:31:00.000Z	maco	isolat3dsh33p	window manager
2010-01-07T14:32:00.000Z	maco	isolat3dsh33p	AWN = Avant Window Navigator
2010-01-07T14:32:00.000Z	maco	isolat3dsh33p	AWN is a dock
2010-01-07T14:33:00.000Z	isolat3dsh33p	maco	any window manager?
2010-01-07T14:33:00.000Z	maco	isolat3dsh33p	yes, WM is jsut short for "window manager"
2010-01-07T14:33:00.000Z	maco	isolat3dsh33p	so you can say "my wm is fluxbox" or "i use xmonad for my wm"
2010-01-07T14:34:00.000Z	maco	isolat3dsh33p	note also that a desktop environment and a window manager are different. GNOME, Xfce, and KDE are all DE's. their respective default WMs are metacity, xfwm4, and kwin
2010-01-07T14:34:00.000Z	isolat3dsh33p	maco	that's clear stuffs! thanks :)
