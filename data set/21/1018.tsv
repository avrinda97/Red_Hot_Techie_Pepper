2011-03-03T16:19:00.000Z	Curious_		hello, i have a remote connection to a server via ssh. i am running an application with GUI on that server but i want to see the GUI on my PC. what can i do?
2011-03-03T16:19:00.000Z	Curious_		i tried "export DISPLAY=MYIP:0"
2011-03-03T16:19:00.000Z	Curious_		but nothing happened when i ran the program
2011-03-03T16:19:00.000Z	Curious_		no
2011-03-03T16:19:00.000Z	Curious_		i just used -l
2011-03-03T16:19:00.000Z	Curious_		to login
2011-03-03T16:19:00.000Z	Curious_		hmm
2011-03-03T16:19:00.000Z	Curious_		ok
2011-03-03T16:20:00.000Z	iceroot	Curious_	you cant connect to a running gui-program with ssh, just start a new gui-program and see it local, for that you have to use "ssh -X host"
2011-03-03T16:20:00.000Z	Curious_		oh ok
2011-03-03T16:20:00.000Z	Curious_	iceroot	if i run "ssh -X host " and run the GUI program on remote server
2011-03-03T16:20:00.000Z	Curious_		where will i be able to see it
2011-03-03T16:20:00.000Z	iceroot	Curious_	if you have used ssh -X e.g. if you are starting firefox on that host, you see it on your local machine
2011-03-03T16:21:00.000Z	Curious_	iceroot	will it be directly seen on my host or will it be seen after i do switching or something like that?
2011-03-03T16:21:00.000Z	iceroot	Curious_	directly
2011-03-03T16:21:00.000Z	Curious_		okay
2011-03-03T16:21:00.000Z	iceroot	Curious_	if "X-Forwarding" is enabled in the ssh-config of the server (but imo its enabled by default in ubuntu)
2011-03-03T16:22:00.000Z	Curious_		hmm, the remote server is scientific-linux
2011-03-03T16:22:00.000Z	Curious_		but it should be enabled since other people also use
2011-03-03T16:22:00.000Z	Curious_		really for?
2011-03-03T16:30:00.000Z	Curious_	iceroot	and others, thank you for your help, it worked
