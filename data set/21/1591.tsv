2010-08-17T20:10:00.000Z	j_ayen_green		running lucid. this morning, the screen was black, and I couldn't get a response. It's running in vbox, so after about 45 minutes, I just shut it down. It turns out that it was doing a full backup, because I had forgotten to mount the network drive where the backups are kept, so it was treating the mount point as a local directory, found no interim backups, and so began a full. Is there some...
2010-08-17T20:10:00.000Z	j_ayen_green		...way to get a response when something like that is going on, a linux version of ctl-alt-del?
2010-08-17T20:11:00.000Z	j_ayen_green		ask the question, not if you can ask a question
2010-08-17T20:11:00.000Z	scampbell	j_ayen_green	trick for the future.  Remove all permissions on the mountpoints (when they aren't mounted).  chmod a-rwx /mountpoint.   When mounted it will have whatever permissions the media wants, when not it's untouchable so that sort thing stands right up instead of hosing all your disk space.
2010-08-17T20:12:00.000Z	j_ayen_green	scampbell	thanks, great tip. aside from that, when a process like that is running and linux won't respond..is there a way to force some response?
2010-08-17T20:13:00.000Z	scampbell	j_ayen_green	my guess is that you ran out of disk space for crucial needs, it's very difficult for me to guess the exact situation.  My flailing attempt would be ctrl-alt-f1 for a text screen and see if I can unfsck things from there.
2010-08-17T20:15:00.000Z	j_ayen_green	scampbell	no, wasn't out of disk space...I'm only using about 10 gig out of 50. I was watching the process monitor in windows (the host) while this was going on, and it was a lot of disk action, the occasional network action (reading a different networked drive that it includes in the backup) and about 80% cpu...so it was active, it was a matter of the screen saver wouldn't respond and clear
2010-08-17T20:19:00.000Z	scampbell	j_ayen_green	Don't know, the evidence given was that a backup process was writing to the wrong place and your system became unresponsive.  I've seen the  screen saver and X in general lock up hard for disk space issues before. If that's not the case for you then we are just playing darwinian pool :)
2010-08-17T20:21:00.000Z	scampbell	j_ayen_green	I can say that in the specific case of the locked screensaved it's goign to be extremely difficult to get around that if it's failed.  It's designed just for that.  Personally, I don't allow screen saver or screen locks to happen on my servers as a matter of safety.
2010-08-17T20:22:00.000Z	j_ayen_green	scampbell	well, it's that it was backing up what is 20% of the total disk space available, so I don't know how that could have filled it.  I shut down the host, rebooted, and then received a fail message on the mount, because the mount point now had files in it, a good share of the full backup, and the deja dup gave me a popup saying the backup had failed for unknown reasons. I presume...
2010-08-17T20:24:00.000Z	scampbell	j_ayen_green	likely so.  It's just terribly difficult to debug a situation like that, you can comb the logs for evidence of the issue but if some resource exhaustion occured there a pretty good likelyhood it didn't make it to the logs anyway. :(
2010-08-17T20:25:00.000Z	j_ayen_green	scampbell	I've noticed in the past that the photo slide show screen saver sometimes just sits there black, and that it's sometimes slow to respond to a mouse click, to clear itself. I wonder if the system being pegged like that and the screen saver having (presumably) a very low priority was a fatal situation
2010-08-17T20:26:00.000Z	scampbell	j_ayen_green	that's one form a resource exhaustion.  Perhaps a message queue got stuffed by the backup software trying to complain about the situation, I could make up others but they're all without evidence :(
2010-08-17T20:28:00.000Z	j_ayen_green	scampbell	could be. I'm of the opinion for some reason that the backup software was having no problem, since it had already created numerous full backup volumes and had plenty of disk space left, but that I just couldn't get to the desktop because of the screen saver being in the way
2010-08-17T20:29:00.000Z	scampbell	j_ayen_green	You would certainly have a better feel for it they I would from this distance :)   I stand by my statement that screen savers don't belong on servers.
2010-08-17T20:30:00.000Z	j_ayen_green	scampbell	well, you have my vote now. i'll look for a desktop slideshow instead of the screensaver :)
2010-08-17T20:34:00.000Z	j_ayen_green	scampbell	so what's ctl-alt-f1 do? I just did it, to try, and the screen went blank and asked for a login, which I gave, and now it's just sitting there
2010-08-17T20:35:00.000Z	j_ayen_green	scampbell	ah, now I appear to be at the command ine
2010-08-17T20:37:00.000Z	scampbell	j_ayen_green	ctrl_alt_f1 switches you to the text screen, no gui at all.  ctrl-alt-f7 (or 8 depending on your installation) will take you back to the graphical.
2010-08-17T20:37:00.000Z	j_ayen_green	scampbell	ah! thanks :)
2010-08-17T20:37:00.000Z	scampbell	j_ayen_green	be aware that a locked screen saver will disallow that action so you can't get out of it that way. another reason why I think screensavers are bad.
