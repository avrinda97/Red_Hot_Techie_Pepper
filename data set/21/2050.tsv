2010-02-05T10:42:00.000Z	bigg6987		when i try anything sudo it says i have the wrong password
2010-02-05T10:42:00.000Z	theadmin	bigg6987	Enter your password, not root password, just in case
2010-02-05T10:45:00.000Z	theadmin	bigg6987	Yep
2010-02-05T10:46:00.000Z	theadmin	bigg6987	Okay... how exactly do you type the command?
2010-02-05T10:47:00.000Z	theadmin	bigg6987	Ah. And it asks you for a password there?
2010-02-05T10:47:00.000Z	theadmin	bigg6987	Well, something might be wrong there. Let us try "gksu update-manager"
2010-02-05T10:48:00.000Z	theadmin	bigg6987	Yep, terminal
2010-02-05T10:50:00.000Z	theadmin	bigg6987	o_O
2010-02-05T10:52:00.000Z	theadmin	bigg6987	Hm. Are you running anything else update-related as root? This could be the problem, you can run only one apt thing at a time
2010-02-05T10:55:00.000Z	bigg6987	theadmin	i was able to do most everything yesterday, updated to 9.10 mouse wouldn't work on my ps3, went back to 9.04. now problems
2010-02-05T11:02:00.000Z	bigg6987	theadmin	should i format and try install #5?
2010-02-05T11:03:00.000Z	theadmin	bigg6987	Actually, I never used Ubuntu on PS, so I don't know what can be the problem there
2010-02-05T11:06:00.000Z	theadmin	bigg6987	Well, I am admininstrating my system lol but that's offtopic
