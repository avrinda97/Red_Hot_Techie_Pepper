2008-06-24T10:03:00.000Z	ikonia	chachin	ubuntu and windows are two operating systems, you don't install an operating system onto another
2008-06-24T10:03:00.000Z	ikonia	chachin	you'd need a form of virtualisation for that
2009-06-14T02:27:00.000Z	ikonia	chachin	1.) wtf is not needed - we know what it means and don't need to see it, 2.) it's been a large channel for years now
