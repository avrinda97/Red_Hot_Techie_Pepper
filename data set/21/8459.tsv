2006-05-25T06:18:00.000Z	Nrbelex		Hi, is it possible to create a link from a file or folder in an external hard drive?
2006-05-25T06:18:00.000Z	ompaul	Nrbelex	bad idea for something that might not be there all the time
2006-05-25T06:19:00.000Z	ompaul	Nrbelex	okay, let me restate that, you can save data on it you can mount it leave it out and have it in FS tab and your going to have problems
2006-05-25T06:20:00.000Z	Nrbelex	ompaul	not sure what that means
2006-05-25T06:20:00.000Z	ompaul	Nrbelex	that was even worse .. mkdir /mnt/outside disk
2006-05-25T06:22:00.000Z	ompaul	Nrbelex	sudo mkdir /outside disk
2006-05-25T06:22:00.000Z	ompaul	Nrbelex	sudo mkdir /outside
2006-05-25T06:22:00.000Z	ompaul	Nrbelex	then System Administration Disks and make it mount
2006-05-25T06:22:00.000Z	ompaul	Nrbelex	that will set it up today
2006-05-25T06:23:00.000Z	ompaul	Nrbelex	three menu functions
2006-05-25T06:23:00.000Z	Nrbelex	ompaul	I didn't realize those were the menus
2006-05-25T06:23:00.000Z	ompaul	Nrbelex	its not permenant
2006-05-25T06:24:00.000Z	ompaul	Nrbelex	if you say that disk is there and it gets unpluged your machine will through a hissy fit
2006-05-25T06:24:00.000Z	ompaul	Nrbelex	so for that little step you could move older data off the machine and anything essential and look at getting a bigger internal drive
2006-05-25T06:26:00.000Z	Nrbelex	ompaul	is there any more permanent solution?
2006-05-25T06:27:00.000Z	ompaul	Nrbelex	yes tell me when you have that done - if the disk does not work your going to have problems starting nasty ones
2006-05-25T06:28:00.000Z	Nrbelex	ompaul	if its that risky, I think I'll take a rain check because even the external isn't very big itself.
2006-05-25T06:28:00.000Z	ompaul	Nrbelex	you can use the method I showed you, when you boot the box
2006-05-25T06:29:00.000Z	ompaul	Nrbelex	back material up from it
2006-05-25T06:29:00.000Z	Nrbelex	ompaul	ok, thanks, I'll figure out some way to do some space-saving
2006-05-25T06:31:00.000Z	ompaul	Nrbelex	the reason is this that if you make that link when the disk is not there then you have to manually remove it from /etc/fstab but if your not used to doing stuff like dropping to single user mode its not plesant (I remember having to do it myself the first time I made a bad mistake many years ago)
