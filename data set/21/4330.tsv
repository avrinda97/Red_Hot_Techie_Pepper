2008-05-13T09:50:00.000Z	hroi		anybody here familiar with optimising their Ubuntu Kernels?
2008-05-13T09:50:00.000Z	hroi		i just came over from Slackware
2008-05-13T09:50:00.000Z	hroi		and always had easy time with kernel.org pure kernels
2008-05-13T09:51:00.000Z	hroi		somebody told me Ubuntu and Suse and other ... are corrupted kernel source... and they need to be from them...
2008-05-13T09:51:00.000Z	hroi		not the pure kernels
2008-05-13T09:51:00.000Z	hroi		that seem really stupid to me... but I think it might be correct ... anyone?
2008-05-13T09:53:00.000Z	MikeCulver	hroi	I have tried to compile a kernel with HDAPS support for my thinkpad... it was pretty easy.  I don't know precisely what you mean by optimizing.. do you mean removing excess modules?
2008-05-13T09:54:00.000Z	hroi	MikeCulver	  yup, thats what I meant
2008-05-13T09:54:00.000Z	hroi	MikeCulver	did you download the kernel source directly from kernel.org?
2008-05-13T09:54:00.000Z	MikeCulver	hroi	I'm a real noob with this.. but aren't lsmod and rmmod pretty much the swiss army knife for that sort of thing?
2008-05-13T09:55:00.000Z	hroi	MikeCulver	  ehhh thats just for kernel modules
2008-05-13T09:55:00.000Z	hroi	MikeCulver	 to load and list them... not compiling a new kernel itself
2008-05-13T09:55:00.000Z	MikeCulver	hroi	where a module ends and the kernel begins is still confusing to me.  sorry.
2008-05-13T09:56:00.000Z	MikeCulver	hroi	I understand the concepts completely, but I don't know enough about the tools
2008-05-13T09:56:00.000Z	hroi	MikeCulver	ok,... well you can have a module inside your kernel or loaded as you need it... however sound to me like you didnt download a new kernel like a newer version so..
2008-05-13T09:58:00.000Z	hroi	MikeCulver	I love Ubuntu because they have done so much work on all the drivers, and my laptop is a mess when getting drivers to work
2008-05-13T09:58:00.000Z	MikeCulver	hroi	What I did was download the kernel headers.. and module source for HDAPSD
2008-05-13T09:58:00.000Z	hroi	MikeCulver	but I love the purity and speed of Slackware...
2008-05-13T09:58:00.000Z	hroi	MikeCulver	yup... I think I know what you did, so you compiled a new kearnel with a patch for this driver
2008-05-13T09:59:00.000Z	MikeCulver	hroi	then I compiled it all together following some arcade web recipe.. and I ended up with a new kernel.. and the kernel logs on boot talking about HDAPS and inital reading and the like.
2008-05-13T09:59:00.000Z	MikeCulver	hroi	yes.. that sounds about like what the instructions said.
