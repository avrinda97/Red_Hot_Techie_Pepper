2007-02-19T11:55:00.000Z	zoidberg		hey guys
2007-02-19T11:55:00.000Z	zoidberg		i'm running badger on an old g3 powerbook
2007-02-19T11:55:00.000Z	zoidberg		i was just wondering
2007-02-19T11:55:00.000Z	zoidberg		i'm trying to install xubuntu-desktop through the terminal
2007-02-19T11:55:00.000Z	macd	zoidberg	"apt-get install xubuntu-desktop" should work
2007-02-19T11:56:00.000Z	macd	zoidberg	then you didnt type install ;P
2007-02-19T12:10:00.000Z	macd	zoidberg	you trying to use a forwarded x-session?
2007-02-19T12:11:00.000Z	zoidberg	macd	well i'm not sure....i thought like an ssh session that was an x-session
2007-02-19T12:11:00.000Z	macd	zoidberg	what are you trying to accomplish?
2007-02-19T12:12:00.000Z	zoidberg	macd	i'm trying to ssh into a computer where i have an account but in a GUI atmosphere not just shell interface
2007-02-19T12:12:00.000Z	macd	zoidberg	you can tunnel an forwarded x-session through ssh.
2007-02-19T12:13:00.000Z	zoidberg	macd	lets back up...i have the an acocunt on another machine...i want to ssh into that machine but in a GUI X-session enviornemnet
2007-02-19T12:14:00.000Z	macd	zoidberg	it depends on the remote machine does it have X? are trhe sessions forwarded?
2007-02-19T12:15:00.000Z	zoidberg	macd	i think it does
2007-02-19T12:15:00.000Z	zoidberg	macd	coz i can use this windows client called XMING and i can log in using an XMDCP  and it logs in with GUI
2007-02-19T12:15:00.000Z	macd	zoidberg	well you would have to set that up, chances are its a shell on a linux box its command line only.
2007-02-19T12:15:00.000Z	macd	zoidberg	ahhhhh
2007-02-19T12:16:00.000Z	macd	zoidberg	you can use xdcmp with ubuntu, just choose the XDCMP session in gnome before you login, then give it the remote machines address.
2007-02-19T12:17:00.000Z	zoidberg	macd	thanx
2007-02-19T13:18:00.000Z	zoidberg	macd	are u there
2007-02-19T13:18:00.000Z	zoidberg	macd	u told me how to do it but i couldnt find the XMDCP option in the log in session menu
