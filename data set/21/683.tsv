2012-05-10T20:41:00.000Z	auronandace	Oprtz	i suppose you are using a ppa then, if so you must seek support from the ppa provider
2012-05-10T20:41:00.000Z	Oprtz	auronandace	 ppa ? wat is this
2012-05-10T20:42:00.000Z	Oprtz	auronandace	 no its not PPA, just install ubuntu 12.04 one week ago
2012-05-10T20:42:00.000Z	auronandace	Oprtz	and added an unsupported kernel
2012-05-10T20:43:00.000Z	auronandace	Oprtz	12.04 uses 3.2
