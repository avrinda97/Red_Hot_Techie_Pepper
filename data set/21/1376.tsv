2010-11-06T19:55:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	sresu_	you need to pair your phone with the computer, use the bluetooth icon to "setup a new device"
2010-11-06T19:55:00.000Z	sresu_	ilovefairuz	After that?
2010-11-06T19:56:00.000Z	sresu_	ilovefairuz	Is it part of "Setup a new device" ?
2010-11-06T19:56:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	sresu_	go through the wizard and complete it, then right lick on the bluetooth icon, hover over your phone's entry and select browse, should open the phone files in the file manager and you can copy stuff to it
