2010-12-22T14:54:00.000Z	tonysan		hello, If I install ubuntu on a SCSI disk, then install the drive to another computer, will it boot?
2010-12-22T14:56:00.000Z	bonjoyee	tonysan	if u install grub to that disk as well. then it should boot
2010-12-22T14:57:00.000Z	bonjoyee	tonysan	on that computer u have to select this scsi disk as the boot device
2010-12-22T14:59:00.000Z	tonysan	bonjoyee	If the target compputer is SMP, will that be a problem?
2010-12-22T14:59:00.000Z	bonjoyee	tonysan	whats smp? i dont get it:-/

2010-12-22T15:01:00.000Z	bonjoyee	tonysan	the cpu's have nothing to do with the booting as long as the arch is correct like x86 or whatever...
2010-12-22T15:02:00.000Z	bonjoyee	tonysan	its grub and your bios that has to support booting from your scsi device
2010-12-22T15:02:00.000Z	tonysan	bonjoyee	ok, that's x86 right. My server is down, grub error 17, So I need to take a bootable disk to rescue it
2010-12-22T15:02:00.000Z	bonjoyee	tonysan	did u try a livecd?
2010-12-22T15:03:00.000Z	tonysan	bonjoyee	the worst part of that machine is, its IDE channel seems very faulty
2010-12-22T15:03:00.000Z	bonjoyee	tonysan	does it support booting from usb? if yes try liveusb
2010-12-22T15:04:00.000Z	tonysan	bonjoyee	I am pretty desperate cause it is a 10-year-old machine
2010-12-22T15:05:00.000Z	bonjoyee	tonysan	hmmm...then ur only luck is a disk with ubuntu pre installed on it ..i guess
2010-12-22T15:06:00.000Z	tonysan	bonjoyee	The data we're trying to rescue is a RAID 5 Volume
2010-12-22T15:07:00.000Z	bonjoyee	tonysan	 sorry then...can't help with that..
2010-12-22T15:07:00.000Z	tonysan	bonjoyee	If thing gone worse, I might have to tear down the RAID volume, get another workstation to deal with
2010-12-22T15:07:00.000Z	tonysan	bonjoyee	Just hope it will boot :D
2010-12-22T15:07:00.000Z	tonysan	bonjoyee	thanks!
2011-01-06T18:46:00.000Z	bonjoyee	tonysan	are u logged in?
