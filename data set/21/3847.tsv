2008-09-08T19:10:00.000Z	shank		Just installed ubuntu server on a Poweredge 2650 with broadcom net extreme card. I'm having issues, I cannot use anything network related. pinging gives me a destination unreachable....
2008-09-08T19:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	shank	"ip a" and "ip route" output on a pastebin would be nice to have...
2008-09-08T19:13:00.000Z	shank	erUSUL	what is a paste bin
2008-09-08T19:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	shank	add what soundray asked to the big paste
2008-09-08T19:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	shank	everything seems correctly set up ... only thing left is a driver bug...
2008-09-08T19:28:00.000Z	shank	erUSUL	so.. what does that mean, lol...driver update? or
2008-09-08T19:28:00.000Z	shank	erUSUL	i'm prolly a 2 out of 10 when it comes to knowledge in *nix
2008-09-08T19:37:00.000Z	erUSUL	shank	soundray maybe tweaking something with ethtool ? like forcing some rate or full/half duplex?
2008-09-08T19:37:00.000Z	shank	erUSUL	what command shall i run to enable full duplex
2008-09-08T19:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	shank	"sudo ethtool eth0" should give you current status of some conf options ...
2008-09-08T19:38:00.000Z	shank	erUSUL	okay i see a list of options..
2008-09-08T19:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	shank	try "sudo ethtool -s eth1 speed 1000 duplex full" but keep in mind i just shooting in the dark
2008-09-08T19:41:00.000Z	shank	erUSUL	I did eth0, and it set.
2008-09-08T19:42:00.000Z	shank	erUSUL	do i need to restart network services?
2008-09-08T19:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	shank	and have that solved the problem ?? ^_^
2008-09-08T19:42:00.000Z	shank	erUSUL	still destination unreachable
2008-09-08T19:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	shank	:|
2008-09-08T19:43:00.000Z	shank	erUSUL	i'm beginning to dislike linux
2008-09-08T19:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	shank	sorry... i'm out of ideas ... maybe you can reload the driver... "sudo modprobe -r tg3 && sudo modprobe tg3" and see if that makes any diference?
2008-09-08T19:47:00.000Z	shank	erUSUL	no worries, yea reloaded and restarted, no luck... ahh
2008-09-08T19:47:00.000Z	shank	erUSUL	maybe I look will get a intel PCI card and solve my problem
