2006-10-17T10:16:00.000Z	ezeki3l		i've installed basic development packages, they don't have man pages. which package has man pages for various C functions?
2006-10-17T10:17:00.000Z	ezeki3l		?
2006-10-17T10:17:00.000Z	ezeki3l		anyone knows the package name for man pages for c functions?
2006-10-17T10:18:00.000Z	ofer1	ezeki3l	it comes with almost every unix. especially ubuntu.
2006-10-17T10:18:00.000Z	ezeki3l	ofer1	yea, i would imagine
2006-10-17T10:18:00.000Z	ofer1	ezeki3l	example: man printf
2006-10-17T10:18:00.000Z	ezeki3l		but this fresh install of ubuntu doesn't have even the printf
2006-10-17T10:18:00.000Z	ezeki3l	ofer1	it has the shells printf
2006-10-17T10:19:00.000Z	ofer1	ezeki3l	as you can see, printf is a program. you have to use the correct number, for example: man 3 printf
2006-10-17T10:19:00.000Z	ezeki3l		but not the C one
2006-10-17T10:19:00.000Z	ezeki3l		i want a C function
2006-10-17T10:19:00.000Z	ofer1	ezeki3l	yeah, that's what I'm telling you know
2006-10-17T10:19:00.000Z	ezeki3l		like malloc for example
2006-10-17T10:19:00.000Z	ofer1	ezeki3l	s/know/now/
2006-10-17T10:19:00.000Z	ezeki3l		citrus@citrus-laptop:~/Desktop/intr$ man malloc
2006-10-17T10:19:00.000Z	ezeki3l		No manual entry for malloc
2006-10-17T10:20:00.000Z	ofer1	ezeki3l	try it: man 3 malloc
2006-10-17T10:20:00.000Z	ezeki3l		citrus@citrus-laptop:~/Desktop/intr$ man 3 malloc
2006-10-17T10:20:00.000Z	ezeki3l		No manual entry for malloc in section 3
2006-10-17T10:20:00.000Z	ezeki3l		i don't even have the C's printf man page
2006-10-17T10:20:00.000Z	ofer1	ezeki3l	aptitude install build-essential
