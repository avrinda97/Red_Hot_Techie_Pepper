2009-08-18T19:13:00.000Z	grawity	guestadmin	It might be a difference between the old and new AIM clients though.
2009-08-18T19:13:00.000Z	guestadmin	grawity	Well there goes my theory ;)
2009-08-18T19:13:00.000Z	grawity	guestadmin	What IM client are you using?
2009-08-18T19:14:00.000Z	grawity	guestadmin	Any reasons for using such an old thing?
2009-08-18T19:15:00.000Z	guestadmin	grawity	;) newest supported official Linux client
2009-08-18T19:15:00.000Z	grawity	guestadmin	Why not, for example, Pidgin or Empathy?
2009-08-18T19:16:00.000Z	guestadmin	grawity	Like the old basic interface better, Im not one for newer stuff, still a terminal addict as well
2009-08-18T19:16:00.000Z	grawity	guestadmin	Hmm. Could you try sending something to me, for example?
2009-08-18T19:16:00.000Z	guestadmin	grawity	sure
2009-08-18T19:17:00.000Z	grawity	guestadmin	grawity@gmail.com, send anything random
2009-08-18T19:18:00.000Z	guestadmin	grawity	?I can send email, just not "AIM File Transfer" ;)
2009-08-18T19:18:00.000Z	grawity	guestadmin	Um, that is my AIM account :)
2009-08-18T19:18:00.000Z	grawity	guestadmin	I do have an older one, just 'grawity', in case AIM doesn't accept that one.
2009-08-18T19:18:00.000Z	guestadmin	grawity	ah, ok
2009-08-18T19:19:00.000Z	guestadmin	grawity	"Desi......"Will send shortly
2009-08-18T19:21:00.000Z	guestadmin	grawity	sending
2009-08-18T19:21:00.000Z	grawity	guestadmin	Well, it seemed to work.
2009-08-18T19:24:00.000Z	guestadmin	grawity	hmm and you use pidgin?
2009-08-18T19:24:00.000Z	grawity	guestadmin	Yes
2009-08-18T19:25:00.000Z	guestadmin	grawity	Interesting, well I'm stumped I have so far found no logical pattern in the transfer problems
