2006-10-14T05:38:00.000Z	Lattyware		Like uTorrent, but cross platform. I hate having to run uTorrent under wine.
2006-10-14T05:38:00.000Z	Lattyware		limewire?
2006-10-14T05:39:00.000Z	Lattyware		I can't run somthing constantly that is that intensive on my system.
2006-10-14T05:41:00.000Z	Lattyware		Frankly, the only choices I see are Azureus and uTorrent, as they are the only ones with all of the features that I want.
2006-10-14T05:41:00.000Z	Lattyware		and Azureus just kills my system.
2006-10-14T05:42:00.000Z	mnepton	Lattyware	tried BitTornado or Torrentflux?
2006-10-14T05:43:00.000Z	Lattyware		BitTornado yes, see my resonce above, torrentflux no.
2006-10-14T05:43:00.000Z	Lattyware		But I really need DHT support.
2006-10-14T05:43:00.000Z	Lattyware		Which most lack.
2006-10-14T05:45:00.000Z	mnepton	Lattyware	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTornado | http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_BitTorrent_clients <-- had DHT
2006-10-14T05:46:00.000Z	mnepton	Lattyware	*has
2006-10-14T05:46:00.000Z	mnepton		munh
2006-10-14T05:46:00.000Z	Lattyware		does it? Hmmm, still, it's not multi-torrent.
2006-10-14T05:46:00.000Z	mnepton	Lattyware	you can open as many instances as you need.
2006-10-14T05:47:00.000Z	Lattyware		yes, but I don't want  them all going at once.
2006-10-14T05:47:00.000Z	Lattyware		I want them queued.
2006-10-14T05:47:00.000Z	mnepton	Lattyware	so start and stop them or limit rates, just like in Azureus.
2006-10-14T05:47:00.000Z	Lattyware		As one finishes the other needs to start.
2006-10-14T05:47:00.000Z	Lattyware		But I will often leave it for ages, alone, so I need it to run through them in order, automatically.
2006-10-14T05:48:00.000Z	mnepton	Lattyware	then use Torrentflux
2006-10-14T05:49:00.000Z	Lattyware	mnepton	no DHT
