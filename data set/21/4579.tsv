2008-03-28T17:17:00.000Z	Svenstaro	Yazan-	doesnt your speedtouch have a rj45 connector?
2008-03-28T17:16:00.000Z	Svenstaro	Yazan-	you will not have success emulating a driver in wine
2008-03-28T17:17:00.000Z	Yazan-	Svenstaro	Then how would I go on about connecting to the internet when I'm on ubuntu running from a CD?
2008-03-28T17:18:00.000Z	Yazan-	Svenstaro	The internet speedtouch needs to be installed from a CD
2008-03-28T17:18:00.000Z	Svenstaro	Yazan-	ah I get what you are saying, no it needs not, ubuntu has built in PPPOE support
2008-03-28T17:18:00.000Z	Svenstaro	Yazan-	you got userlogin info right?
2008-03-28T17:19:00.000Z	Svenstaro	Yazan-	well, just enter that in the ubuntu network configuration and youre all set, no need for some strange software
2008-03-28T17:19:00.000Z	Yazan-	Svenstaro	I'm all new, I will go and check what configuration you're talking about
2008-03-28T17:20:00.000Z	Svenstaro	Yazan-	its quite obvious
2008-03-28T17:21:00.000Z	Yazan-	Svenstaro	The network config is shown from the drop down menu in the top part of the screen
2008-03-28T17:21:00.000Z	Svenstaro	Yazan-	well that one only connect to auto-detected connection, you want to use the connection wizard from the menu
2008-03-29T22:52:00.000Z	Svenstaro	Yazan-	you should run a virtual machine in your ubuntu which acts as an internal router, prolly the easiest
2008-03-29T22:52:00.000Z	Yazan-	Svenstaro	How can I do that?
2008-03-29T22:53:00.000Z	Svenstaro	Yazan-	hang on, i got something nicer https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsbAdslModem/SpeedTouch
2008-03-29T22:55:00.000Z	Yazan-	Svenstaro	Isn't that guide same as this: http://www.linux-usb.org/SpeedTouch/ubuntu/index.html
2008-03-29T22:57:00.000Z	Yazan-	Svenstaro	Isn't that guide same as this: http://www.linux-usb.org/SpeedTouch/ubuntu/index.html
2008-03-29T22:57:00.000Z	Svenstaro	Yazan-	wait, ill check it out
2008-03-29T22:57:00.000Z	Svenstaro	Yazan-	no its not
2008-03-29T22:59:00.000Z	Yazan-	Svenstaro	I'm so sick of this. I have been trying for 3days now with no luck ;( I really hope your way works. You just gave me hope.
2008-03-29T22:59:00.000Z	Svenstaro	Yazan-	I never tried that one, if I were you Id create a virtual machine in vmware/vbox that hosts IPcop, that one has support for usb speedtouches integrated
2008-03-29T23:00:00.000Z	Yazan-	Svenstaro	There is one problem, when it'll ask me about rebooting my computer and I do it, All the things I've  done will just get lost. Nothing would get saved
