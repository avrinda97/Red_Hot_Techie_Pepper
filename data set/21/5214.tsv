2007-12-07T13:18:00.000Z	AgentHeX		anyone know where the config option is to see "shutdown" and "restart" in the "Quit..." section of the "System" menu?
2007-12-07T13:20:00.000Z	AgentHeX		i used to see them, but now I don't.  both suspend and hibernation don't work, and luckily i have shutdown mapped to my power button or i would be bringing up the console and typing sudo /sbin/shutdown or reboot
2007-12-07T13:22:00.000Z	AgentHeX		it's just when i hit System->Quit..., i don't see options for restart or shutdown.  i have log out, lock, suspend, hibernate, and one more i can't remember, but i can't see shutdown or restart

2007-12-07T13:25:00.000Z	AgentHeX		drop that in /var/cache and run "sudo aptitude reinstall flashplugin-nonfree"
2007-12-07T13:26:00.000Z	AgentHeX		!vncd
2007-12-07T13:26:00.000Z	AgentHeX		meh
2007-12-07T13:28:00.000Z	AgentHeX		!vnc4server
2007-12-07T13:28:00.000Z	AgentHeX		well, it's in the repository...  :(

2007-12-07T13:31:00.000Z	eNons3nse	AgentHeX	I'm at the static IP configure screen.  how do i know what to put in for IP, Mask & Gateway
2007-12-07T13:26:00.000Z	AgentHeX	eNons3nse	you should have a network icon in the top right.  click that and manually configure.
2007-12-07T13:34:00.000Z	AgentHeX	eNons3nse	you probably want some IP on your local network.  i.e. 192.168.0.x where the subnet mask is typically 255.255.255.0 for class C networks (i.e. 99% of home networks) and the gateway is your router's IP address (where the port is being forwarded from)
2007-12-07T13:48:00.000Z	eNons3nse	AgentHeX	so my gateway would be the same address I go to to change my router settings?  192.168.0.1
2007-12-07T13:48:00.000Z	AgentHeX	eNons3nse	yes
2007-12-07T13:50:00.000Z	eNons3nse	AgentHeX	so my gateway would be the same address I go to to change my router settings?  192.168.0.1
2007-12-07T13:50:00.000Z	AgentHeX	eNons3nse	yes
2007-12-07T13:51:00.000Z	eNons3nse	AgentHeX	so i'm doing this for my wired connection.  whenever i change it to something other than "roaming mode" it doesn't even give me the option to connect to a wired network in my settings.  but i can still connect to my router wirelessly.
2007-12-07T13:52:00.000Z	AgentHeX	eNons3nse	use "sudo ifconfig" on the command line to get the status for your network adapters
2007-12-07T13:52:00.000Z	AgentHeX	eNons3nse	even if you don't see it in the network menu anymore, you should see it there
2007-12-07T13:52:00.000Z	AgentHeX	eNons3nse	probably eth0, but could be other
