2011-03-25T02:40:00.000Z	riptly		I just installed Ubuntu 10.10, it popped out the CD from my drive, and I pressed enter once it was out. Now it's just sitting there (the computer) and the screen is pitch black. No key press works, it's like it froze up right before the reboot or something? This is a fresh install on a freshly formated disk - just I just manually turn the computer off or .... wait?

2011-03-25T02:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	riptly	if you use an nvidia video chip, use the bootoption: nouveau.blacklist=1   instead of the nomodeset one described
2011-03-25T02:41:00.000Z	riptly	ActionParsnip	I have yet to enter Ubuntu, this is right after the installation completes.
2011-03-25T02:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	riptly	fine, but do you know your video chip?
2011-03-25T02:42:00.000Z	riptly	ActionParsnip	I'm on ATI radeon
2011-03-25T02:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	riptly	the boot options are appplied before the OS loads and will change how the kernel works
2011-03-25T02:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	riptly	use the nomodeset option as described in the link then, should be ok
2011-03-25T02:43:00.000Z	riptly	ActionParsnip	I don't think you understand my problem, let me rephrase.
2011-03-25T02:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	riptly	hold shift at boot and you can add the boot options
2011-03-25T02:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	riptly	the nomodeset option will sort the black screen
2011-03-25T02:47:00.000Z	riptly	ActionParsnip	Yes, as you said, but I'm just wondering if I'll corrupt the installation if I just manually shut it down now.
2011-03-25T02:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	riptly	did the install say it's done?
2011-03-25T02:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	riptly	misunderstood earlier, sorry
2011-03-25T02:49:00.000Z	riptly	ActionParsnip	Yea, I was trying to tell you but the answers kept coming so I figured I was misunderstanding :\
2011-03-25T02:49:00.000Z	riptly	ActionParsnip	Alright, pulling the plug.... *shrugs*
2011-03-25T02:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	riptly	just hold power btn for 5 secs, it will die good
2011-03-25T02:51:00.000Z	riptly	ActionParsnip	I'm an expert in shutting it down manually :)
2011-03-25T02:52:00.000Z	riptly	ActionParsnip	bazhang: It worked.
2011-03-25T02:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	riptly	sweet
2011-03-25T02:53:00.000Z	riptly	ActionParsnip	bazhang: Thanks for the assistance!
