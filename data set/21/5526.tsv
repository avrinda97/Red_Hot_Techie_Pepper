2008-04-18T11:47:00.000Z	abhi_	bazhang	what if i don't have time to make an image? i shouldn't be allowed to eject it so simply.
2008-04-18T11:48:00.000Z	bazhang	abhi_	you have been given some options; why not choose the best one for you and solve it
2010-06-26T10:31:00.000Z	bazhang	abhi_	help with what
2010-06-26T10:32:00.000Z	bazhang	abhi_	does ifconfig show wlan0 ?
2010-06-26T10:33:00.000Z	bazhang	abhi_	is there a switch on the side to enable it? is this a dual boot?
2010-06-26T10:36:00.000Z	bazhang	abhi_	some of the dual boot situations the windows side will shut down the card unless otherwise specified; make sure it is not set to do so
2010-06-26T10:36:00.000Z	abhi_	bazhang	then the h/w switch should turn it on ... i m not sure...
2010-06-26T10:37:00.000Z	bazhang	abhi_	you may also try sudo ifup wlan0 (or whatever the nic is)
2010-06-26T10:37:00.000Z	bazhang	abhi_	yep, if there is a hw switch
2010-06-26T10:38:00.000Z	abhi_	bazhang	yes ,i have hardware switch...

2010-06-26T10:38:00.000Z	bazhang	abhi_	you need to set it to on then reboot with it that way
