2010-09-17T05:03:00.000Z	jakegub		I still need help with my Ubuntu dual boot install.  I have Win7 on a 250gb drive. I have 50gb of the drive as "unallocated space".  During the ubuntu install, my Win7 is not recognized including any of the partitions
2010-09-17T05:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jakegub	What is the output of "sudo os-prober"?
2010-09-17T05:06:00.000Z	jakegub	Jordan_U	/dev/sda1:Windows 7 (loader):Windows:chain
2010-09-17T05:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jakegub	Could you go into the manual partitioning option of the installer and post a screenshot?

2010-09-17T05:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jakegub	Can you pastebin the output of "sudo blkid"?

2010-09-17T05:31:00.000Z	jakegub	Jordan_U	did my pastebin answer any questions for you?  http://pastebin.com/rXS7MSMV
2010-09-17T05:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jakegub	I can't tell why Ubuntu's installer isn't detecting the partitions but the kernel obviously is. Can you try installing "gdisk" and pastebin the output of "sudo gdisk /dev/sda" ?

2010-09-17T05:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jakegub	Ok, that's likely the problem. The Ubuntu installer is probably reading the GUID partition table, and the kernel is reading the msdos partition table (or visa versa).
2010-09-17T05:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jakegub	One of the partition tables contains no partitions, probably the GPT one. Select MBR and see if gdisk lists your partitions. If it does, and if it gives an option to remove the GUID partition table then do that (Nothing is actually written to disk by gdisk untill you enter "w").
2010-09-17T05:59:00.000Z	jakegub	Jordan_U	Do I need to hit w and then run gparted?
2010-09-17T06:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jakegub	Can you pastebin all the output from gdisk?
2010-09-17T06:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jakegub	I'm going to need to leave in about 5 minutes.

2010-09-17T06:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jakegub	Try "p", if that lists your partitions then use "w".
2010-09-17T06:08:00.000Z	jakegub	Jordan_U	Done.  P listed partitions, so I hit w
2010-09-17T06:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jakegub	If that doesn't remove the GPT then you'll have to use another option that I can't remember off the top of my head, and I need to leave now. I'll be back in 4/5 hours though.
