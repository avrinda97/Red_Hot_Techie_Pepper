2007-10-28T04:56:00.000Z	EnigmaX		Jordan, I'm trying to install InstantBird
2007-10-28T04:56:00.000Z	guru	EnigmaX	tar xzvf instantbird-0.1.tar.gz
2007-10-28T04:56:00.000Z	guru	EnigmaX	apt-cache search instantbird
2007-10-28T04:57:00.000Z	guru	EnigmaX	if it's not found in apt then you will need to install it from the .tar.gz you have
2007-10-28T04:57:00.000Z	guru	EnigmaX	scroll up, extract the archive and run the resulting script
2007-10-28T04:58:00.000Z	EnigmaX	guru	 I extracted the archive
2007-10-28T04:59:00.000Z	guru	EnigmaX	./instantbird.sh or sh instantbird.sh
2007-10-28T04:59:00.000Z	guru	EnigmaX	you may need to do it as sudo, i have no idea what the software does so you might want to look through the script first and make sure it's safe
2007-10-28T05:01:00.000Z	guru	EnigmaX	then the program is probably contained within that script and it's all you need
2007-10-28T05:03:00.000Z	guru	EnigmaX	yes, looking now
2007-10-28T05:05:00.000Z	guru	EnigmaX	i'm not going to install it
2007-10-28T05:05:00.000Z	guru	EnigmaX	i don't need another messaging client
