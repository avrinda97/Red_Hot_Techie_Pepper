2008-05-29T17:27:00.000Z	marcat		is the full kernel source code in /usr/src/linux-header-2.6....
2008-05-29T17:27:00.000Z	patric_	marcat	when you downloaded it yes
2008-05-29T17:28:00.000Z	marcat	patric_	i upgraded to 8.04 and there are files in the directory, i dont know if it is the entier thing
2008-05-29T17:28:00.000Z	patric_	marcat	did you download the sources and set the symlink on /usr/src/linux
2008-05-29T17:28:00.000Z	patric_	marcat	first of all you should download all the sources using apt oder synaptic
2008-05-29T17:29:00.000Z	patric_	marcat	they are named like linux-kernel or something like that
2008-05-29T17:30:00.000Z	marcat	patric_	http://paste.ubuntu.com/15525/
2008-05-29T17:31:00.000Z	patric_	marcat	don't you want to compile the newest kernel?
2008-05-29T17:31:00.000Z	marcat	patric_	what is the newest? i thought tha was fairly new
2008-05-29T17:33:00.000Z	patric_	marcat	sry needed to reconnect
2008-05-29T17:35:00.000Z	marcat	patric_	this is just practice, im not concerned with the newest version. I was wondering if that is all the code i needed. the stuff you said above i havent read else where
2008-05-29T17:36:00.000Z	patric_	marcat	ok just set a symlink of the sources you want to use to /usr/src/linux. and then go to /usr/src/linux and start the compiling
2008-05-29T17:37:00.000Z	marcat	patric_	what is the reason for that?
2008-05-29T17:38:00.000Z	patric_	marcat	huh i dunno it's in the fsh so ervery distributor needs to keep it this way
2008-05-29T17:39:00.000Z	patric_	marcat	but basicly its for peoble that compile 4 kernels a day. so they can just set the symlink to the newest sources and go to /usr/src and start compiling
2008-05-29T17:56:00.000Z	marcat	patric_	uh...does that copy data off other computers?
2008-05-29T17:56:00.000Z	patric_	marcat	no it doesn't
2008-05-29T18:12:00.000Z	marcat	patric_	what do you cook?
2008-05-29T18:13:00.000Z	patric_	marcat	am sry how did came to the idea i'm cooking?
2008-05-29T18:13:00.000Z	marcat	patric_	chef/chief
