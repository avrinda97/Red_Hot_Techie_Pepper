2009-06-05T02:27:00.000Z	savid		I just installed a fresh copy of 9.04 on a macbook with an NVidia GeForce 8600M GT,   and I'm not seeing anything in the restricted drivers tool.  Any ideas?
2009-06-05T02:28:00.000Z	Scunizi	savid	open a terminal and type sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade.. when finished try the Hardware drivers tab again to see if it's there.
2009-06-05T02:29:00.000Z	Scunizi	savid	DON'T use envyng unless you want to break your system later.
2009-06-05T02:32:00.000Z	Scunizi	savid	if that doesn't work you might need to install the nvidia driver you download directly from their site.. BUT if you do that, anytime there is a kernel upgrade you'll have to reinstall the driver. Not really a big deal if you're comfortable with the terminal.
2009-06-05T02:37:00.000Z	savid	Scunizi	 I did all that and it's still not showing up in System > Administration > Hardware Drivers
2009-06-05T03:00:00.000Z	Scunizi	savid	after updating did it ask you to restart?
2009-06-05T03:00:00.000Z	savid	Scunizi	no it didn't
2009-06-05T03:00:00.000Z	Scunizi	savid	you running gnome or kde?
2009-06-05T03:00:00.000Z	savid	Scunizi	gnome
2009-06-05T03:00:00.000Z	savid	Scunizi	I logged out and in again
2009-06-05T03:01:00.000Z	Scunizi	savid	that would typically do it.. it's weird that nothing is showing up.. ActionParsnip you following this? I think you had mentioned to savid to install the nvidia-glx-180 package but it's still not showing up in hardware drivers.
2009-06-05T03:02:00.000Z	savid	Scunizi	 ActionParsnip:  should I run nvidia-settings?
2009-06-05T03:02:00.000Z	Scunizi	savid	that only works if the driver is installed.
2009-06-05T03:03:00.000Z	Scunizi	savid	which card again?  the 8300?
2009-06-05T03:03:00.000Z	savid	Scunizi	 lspci reports:   nVidia Corporation GeForce 8600M GT (rev a1)
2009-06-05T03:05:00.000Z	Scunizi	savid	installing the latest driver will insure that the driver WILL break when you get a kernel upgrade.. you'll have to reinstall the driver again at that point.
2009-06-05T03:06:00.000Z	savid	Scunizi	 not sure why I have to install the latest driver,   nvidia-glx-180 description says that the driver should work w/ my card
2009-06-05T03:07:00.000Z	Scunizi	savid	should but it's tough getting it working when it's not showing up. also I think it's version 180.5x which wasn't bad but the latest drive is 180.6x and has numerous bug fixes.
2009-06-05T03:08:00.000Z	Scunizi	savid	should but it's tough getting it working when it's not showing up. also I think it's version 180.5x which wasn't bad but the latest drive is 180.6x and has numerous bug fixes.
2009-06-05T03:14:00.000Z	savid	Scunizi	 I just ran nvidia-xconfig and it works -- the currently installed drivers were correct.
2009-06-05T03:14:00.000Z	Scunizi	savid	AH! cool.  if you notice weirdness with screen writes while dragging windows you might consider upgrading the driver.
