2011-05-30T04:46:00.000Z	ubuntucork		is still valid :)
2011-05-30T04:46:00.000Z	ubuntucork		aaaaah right...oops!!!
2011-05-30T04:46:00.000Z	ubuntucork		I didnt see before i came in, so now i have you!!
2011-05-30T04:48:00.000Z	RevSpecies116	ubuntucork	We shall assume all backups are already done
2011-05-30T04:48:00.000Z	ubuntucork	RevSpecies116	Assuming backups, keeping small computer shops in business all this time ;-)
2011-05-30T04:49:00.000Z	RevSpecies116		Let's just resolve the problem for this chap, eh, ubuntucork
2011-05-30T04:49:00.000Z	ubuntucork		Kill Bill? ;-)
2011-05-30T04:50:00.000Z	RevSpecies116		now, ubuntucork, for the sake of this help process, also assume that WUBI is out of the question: and continue from there
2011-05-30T04:50:00.000Z	ubuntucork		okdokey
2011-05-30T04:51:00.000Z	ubuntucork		backup all data to a cloud service where possible, as using a USB drive is now out of the question or thus far assumed to be
2011-05-30T04:51:00.000Z	RevSpecies116		with a 2GB HDD, wouldn't xubuntu or lubuntu be better?
2011-05-30T04:52:00.000Z	RevSpecies116	ubuntucork	He has installed ubuntu from USB before, it just happens to be the UNE version that will not boot from USB
2011-05-30T04:53:00.000Z	RevSpecies116		Ahh, OKies, KM0201 - didn't know that
2011-05-30T04:53:00.000Z	ubuntucork	RevSpecies116	I hate to admit it but with space at a premium then the best but user unfriendly way to do it is with Slackware
2011-05-30T04:54:00.000Z	RevSpecies116	ubuntucork	only unfriendly for those new to Linux ;) I've used Slackware - quite like all the time spent at the terminal ;)
2011-05-30T04:54:00.000Z	ubuntucork		can install only the drivers needed one by one etc etc.  Not an easy task for a GUI setup
2011-05-30T04:55:00.000Z	ubuntucork	RevSpecies116	I agree but, then I am runing Lucid and salivating about 12.04 LTS and not whats in between :)
2011-05-30T04:55:00.000Z	RevSpecies116		OKies, atlambert, we are at an empasse. How do you want to go forward? How much space do you have on your netbook if you formatted the whole thing?
2011-05-30T04:55:00.000Z	RevSpecies116		2GB seems like 'not the truth' so to speak
2011-05-30T04:56:00.000Z	ubuntucork		Whats this mythical OS called "Windows" you speak of? ;-)
2011-05-30T04:57:00.000Z	RevSpecies116	ubuntucork	I also am on Lucid - and eagerly awaiting 12.04LTS (I only use the LTS releases). I'm sad that unity is not being backported to Lucid, though
