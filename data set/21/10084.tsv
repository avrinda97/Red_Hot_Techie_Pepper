2005-05-15T16:17:00.000Z	Dhanjel		ok, now modprobe ndiswrapper works. but the wlan0 does not exist
2005-05-15T16:18:00.000Z	Dhanjel		now it does :) but now to the problem I had earlier, no stations are found while scanning. Don't have a cleu to fix that
2005-05-15T16:18:00.000Z	sir-gold	Dhanjel	what wifi card do you have?
2005-05-15T16:18:00.000Z	Dhanjel		I've set the correct channel, but iwlist wlan0 scan does not return any results
2005-05-15T16:18:00.000Z	Dhanjel	sir-gold	a belkin f5d700yy with broadcom chipset
2005-05-15T16:19:00.000Z	Dhanjel		followed the how-to thread on the ubuntuforums with no luck
2005-05-15T16:19:00.000Z	Dhanjel		ndiswrapper -l tells me that the drivers are installed and that the hardware is present
2005-05-15T16:19:00.000Z	Dhanjel		but I can't move on from here
2005-05-15T16:20:00.000Z	sir-gold	Dhanjel	run iwconfig, does your card show up at all?
2005-05-15T16:20:00.000Z	Dhanjel	sir-gold	yeah
2005-05-15T16:20:00.000Z	sir-gold		as what?
2005-05-15T16:20:00.000Z	Dhanjel		wlan0
2005-05-15T16:20:00.000Z	Dhanjel		no invalid nwid, crypt or flags
2005-05-15T16:21:00.000Z	Dhanjel		Link quality: 100/100, Signal level: -10dBM, Noise leel: -256dB;, but no AP mac
2005-05-15T16:22:00.000Z	Dhanjel		Mode managed, Frequency 2.437 (chan 6), which is correct. Don't now why it don't find the ap.
2005-05-15T16:23:00.000Z	sir-gold	Dhanjel	bring up wlan0 with 'ifconfig wlan0 up' and see if that helps
2005-05-15T16:24:00.000Z	Dhanjel	sir-gold	nope no luck
2005-05-15T16:24:00.000Z	Dhanjel		I get this error in the log though, might be a problem? -> wlan0: no IPv6 routers prese
2005-05-15T16:24:00.000Z	Dhanjel		nt
2005-05-15T16:24:00.000Z	sir-gold		well, im out of ideas already, but i have never used ndiswrapper
2005-05-15T16:25:00.000Z	Dhanjel	sir-gold	ok :/
