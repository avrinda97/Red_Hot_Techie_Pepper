2007-09-20T16:33:00.000Z	VSpike		How workable is it to have / and /root and /boot on an LVM partition
2007-09-20T16:32:00.000Z	VSpike		aMSN is fugly. But still less so than windows live messenger et al
2007-09-20T06:38:00.000Z	VSpike		I've got flash 9 installed in firefox, but in konqueror and swiftfox, I only get flash 7.  Any idea how I can fix this?
2007-09-20T06:38:00.000Z	dystopianray	VSpike	uninstall flash 7
2007-09-20T06:48:00.000Z	VSpike	dystopianray	the strange thing is, I'm not sure why/how it *is* installed
2007-09-20T06:49:00.000Z	VSpike	dystopianray	if I do "aptitude search flash", it doesn't show anything isntalled
2007-09-20T06:49:00.000Z	dystopianray	VSpike	i'm nto sure why it'd be installed either
2007-09-20T06:49:00.000Z	VSpike	dystopianray	any idea where i can find the plugin directories?
2007-09-20T06:51:00.000Z	dystopianray	VSpike	/usr/lib/firefox/plugins ?
2007-09-20T06:55:00.000Z	VSpike	dystopianray	there's a libflashplayer.so in there.. can I find out somehow what version it is?  Or, does the browser have a plugins information tool?  I know Opera does.
2007-09-20T06:56:00.000Z	dystopianray	VSpike	about:plugins works in konq
2007-09-20T06:59:00.000Z	VSpike	dystopianray	should they all in theory use the same plugin directories?
2007-09-20T06:59:00.000Z	dystopianray	VSpike	yes
2007-09-20T07:00:00.000Z	dystopianray	VSpike	they are all usually symlinked to look in the same places
2007-09-20T07:00:00.000Z	VSpike	dystopianray	well both swiftfox and konq show flash 7 and flash 9 there, with the same filenames, so I guess they all must be looking in more than one place
2007-09-20T07:01:00.000Z	dystopianray	VSpike	that is possible
2007-09-20T07:01:00.000Z	VSpike	dystopianray	just waiting for find / -name libflashplayer.so to complete
2007-09-20T07:01:00.000Z	dystopianray	VSpike	there is a plugin section in konqueror's settings, see what path it is using for flash 7
2007-09-20T07:08:00.000Z	VSpike	dystopianray	not sure how that one got there.. the one in my home was flash 7, so I just deleted and restarted swiftfox and now its fine
2007-09-20T07:08:00.000Z	VSpike	dystopianray	thanks!
2007-09-20T07:08:00.000Z	dystopianray	VSpike	no problem
