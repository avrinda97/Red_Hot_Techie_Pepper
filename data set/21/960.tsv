2011-03-26T22:22:00.000Z	JohnMF		I don't want to do that
2011-03-26T22:23:00.000Z	JohnMF		Is there a way to remove a symlink?
2011-03-26T22:23:00.000Z	JohnMF		overwide it?
2011-03-26T22:24:00.000Z	JohnMF		override**
2011-03-26T22:24:00.000Z	JohnMF		What command do i use to delete the link
2011-03-26T22:24:00.000Z	JohnMF		rm -rf would delete the file
2011-03-26T22:24:00.000Z	JohnMF		..
2011-03-26T22:24:00.000Z	JohnMF		...
2011-03-26T22:24:00.000Z	JohnMF		Don't think you get me
2011-03-26T22:25:00.000Z	JohnMF		> I want to link file1 to file2 so that anything that tries to access file1, will see file2.     Although, file1 currently has info in it that I don't want to be deleted
2011-03-26T22:25:00.000Z	giff	JohnMF	it's no good idea to default to always using -rf when all you want to do is delete a _file_
2011-03-26T22:25:00.000Z	JohnMF		So later on.. removing the symlink from file1, will delete its current contents too?
2011-03-26T22:26:00.000Z	JohnMF	Dr_Willis	So how do you make a soft link, and remove it
2011-03-26T22:27:00.000Z	JohnMF		rm foo1 would remove the link as well as foo1's contents
2011-03-26T22:27:00.000Z	JohnMF		....
2011-03-26T22:27:00.000Z	JohnMF		how to remove just the link?
2011-03-26T22:28:00.000Z	JohnMF		so you have to rm twice before the contents are deleted?
2011-03-26T22:28:00.000Z	JohnMF		...
2011-03-26T22:28:00.000Z	JohnMF		not much docs on this
2011-03-26T22:28:00.000Z	JohnMF		yeh, not much
2011-03-26T22:28:00.000Z	giff	JohnMF	even with hardlinks, only if all links are deleted the "file" is really deleted
