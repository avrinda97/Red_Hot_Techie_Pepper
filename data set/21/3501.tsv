2008-12-21T19:44:00.000Z	Unknown0BC		How do I get my system to play the sound with a .3gp file ?
2008-12-21T19:45:00.000Z	rbs-tito	Unknown0BC	if totem can't do it, try VLC
2008-12-21T19:45:00.000Z	rbs-tito		!vlc | Unknown0BC
2008-12-21T19:45:00.000Z	Unknown0BC		Totem did not like to play it neither MPlayer.
2008-12-21T19:46:00.000Z	Unknown0BC		I think they all use ffplay not ?
2008-12-21T19:46:00.000Z	rbs-tito		Totem is gstreamer based by default
2008-12-21T19:46:00.000Z	Unknown0BC		VLC will not play it either.
2008-12-21T19:47:00.000Z	rbs-tito	Unknown0BC	sure its a good file?
2008-12-21T19:47:00.000Z	Unknown0BC	rbs-tito	can you play 3gp files with sound ?
2008-12-21T19:48:00.000Z	rbs-tito	Unknown0BC	the ones from my phone work fine, yeah
2008-12-21T19:49:00.000Z	Unknown0BC	rbs-tito	with with vlc ?
2008-12-21T19:49:00.000Z	rbs-tito	Unknown0BC	Totem too
2008-12-21T19:49:00.000Z	Unknown0BC		What Ubuntu do you have ?
2008-12-21T19:49:00.000Z	Unknown0BC		rbs-tito
2008-12-21T19:50:00.000Z	rbs-tito	Unknown0BC	Though i paid for the fluendo codecs so maybe that had an impact. I'm using intrepid
2008-12-21T19:50:00.000Z	Unknown0BC	rbs-tito	I think i'm simply missing a codec even though I see people recompiled ffmpeg in the past to get supprot for .3gp.
2008-12-21T19:50:00.000Z	Unknown0BC		I did install w32codecs.
2008-12-21T19:51:00.000Z	Unknown0BC		I don't need to reboot or something right ?
2008-12-21T19:51:00.000Z	Unknown0BC		:\
2008-12-21T19:51:00.000Z	rbs-tito	Unknown0BC	Try grabbing the ubuntu-restricted-extras package, maybe its in another codec
