2011-05-27T03:12:00.000Z	bluefire	histo	I seek something like a local repository, which i can ocassionaly update from internet, but when it comes to installing software they should be installed locally without accessing the internet.
2011-05-27T03:13:00.000Z	histo	bluefire	you can run your own repo
2011-05-27T03:13:00.000Z	bluefire		I tried downloading deb files from packages.ubuntu.com. But this does not help, as each application has many dependecies.
2011-05-27T03:14:00.000Z	histo	bluefire	did you see the link that I had ubottu post?

2011-05-27T03:16:00.000Z	histo		schmidtm: yeah lol just realized google did that to links copied from search results
2011-05-27T03:18:00.000Z	bluefire	histo	Will this APT chooser search for all the related .deb and dependencies of the application i put in the search field?
2011-05-27T03:18:00.000Z	histo	bluefire	the offline thing will

2011-05-27T03:19:00.000Z	bluefire	histo	yes that is what i am referring to
2011-05-27T03:21:00.000Z	histo	bluefire	yeah you can put in the meta package you have also like ubuntu-desktop so it won't post extra requirements. But I'm not sure this is the best option. What are you actually trying to do can you explain it better?
2011-05-27T03:21:00.000Z	bluefire	histo	thank you, you were a great help :)
2011-05-27T03:25:00.000Z	bluefire	histo	I intend to keep all the software i use ready locally on my computer, just in case if i need to install them again sometime in future and if i am not able to access the internet then. I want a solution for such a situation.
2011-05-27T03:25:00.000Z	histo	bluefire	I would create a package list and backup the /var/cache/apt/  directories
2011-05-27T03:26:00.000Z	histo	bluefire	no need to redownload all the packages again they are already in /var/cache/apt/
2011-05-27T03:27:00.000Z	histo	bluefire	something like dpkg --get-selections > installed-software.txt   would create a list of all the packages
2011-05-27T03:28:00.000Z	bluefire	histo	does this folder contain all the dependent packages of any particular application? if i backup this folder how will i reuse this folder and get all my application back on a fresh ubuntu install without accessing internet?
