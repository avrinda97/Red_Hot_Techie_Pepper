2008-06-23T23:20:00.000Z	abe3k		hi guys
2008-06-23T23:20:00.000Z	DRebellion	abe3k	hey
2008-06-23T23:22:00.000Z	abe3k	DRebellion	: you know any good tool to format a usb disk and partition it ?
2008-06-23T23:30:00.000Z	abe3k	DRebellion	: sorry to bother but when I'm partitioning the usb drive this is the error I get "FAT 1 media 0 doesn't match the boot sector's media f8. You should probably run scandisk.
2008-06-23T23:32:00.000Z	DRebellion	abe3k	have you run scandisk like it suggests?
2008-06-23T23:33:00.000Z	abe3k	DRebellion	: should I type scandisk /dev/sdd1 ?
2008-06-23T23:33:00.000Z	DRebellion	abe3k	I don't actually know what scandisk is.... =/
2008-06-23T23:33:00.000Z	DRebellion	abe3k	perhaps it's part of gparted. Run:  man scandisk
2008-06-23T23:34:00.000Z	abe3k	DRebellion	: yeah the command doesn't exist
2008-06-23T23:34:00.000Z	DRebellion	abe3k	you could try using fdisk instead
2008-06-23T23:34:00.000Z	DRebellion	abe3k	you should look up a guide to using fdisk
2008-06-23T23:34:00.000Z	abe3k	DRebellion	: mhmmm
2008-06-23T23:35:00.000Z	abe3k	DRebellion	: ok I'll give it a try
2008-06-23T23:49:00.000Z	abe3k	DRebellion	: I'm trying dosfsck -a -w -v /dev/sdd1 and I think it'll fix the problem
2008-06-23T23:49:00.000Z	abe3k	DRebellion	: I'll inform you
2008-06-23T23:50:00.000Z	DRebellion	abe3k	kewl
2008-06-23T23:52:00.000Z	abe3k	DRebellion	: hmmm for some reason dosfsck says "  Not automatically fixing this."
2008-06-23T23:53:00.000Z	abe3k	DRebellion	: any ideas ?
2008-06-23T23:53:00.000Z	DRebellion	abe3k	no, sorry.
2008-06-23T23:53:00.000Z	DRebellion	abe3k	perhaps there is an option to force fixing? It recognizes the problem, right? Make sure it isn't mounted, of course.
2008-06-23T23:54:00.000Z	abe3k	DRebellion	: ok I'll do that
