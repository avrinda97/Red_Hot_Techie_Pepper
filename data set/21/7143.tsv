2006-11-20T17:06:00.000Z	Enselic		Is there a way to redirect output from a started program (for insatnce, in the middle fo a long ls listing, is there a way to redirect it to a file)?
2006-11-20T17:07:00.000Z	matevz	Enselic	myProgram > fileName
2006-11-20T17:07:00.000Z	matevz		or, to capture all the output, including errors etc.:
2006-11-20T17:08:00.000Z	matevz		myProgram &2> filename
2006-11-20T17:08:00.000Z	Enselic	matevz	That won't work in the middle of a program, right?
2006-11-20T17:08:00.000Z	matevz		of course not
2006-11-20T17:09:00.000Z	Enselic	matevz	So, is there a way to redirect it in the middle of execution=
2006-11-20T17:09:00.000Z	matevz		you'll have to shut it down and re-run it, sorry
2006-11-20T17:09:00.000Z	Enselic	matevz	Are you sure?
2006-11-20T17:09:00.000Z	matevz	Enselic	Why are you using this?
2006-11-20T17:10:00.000Z	Enselic	matevz	What do you mean?
2006-11-20T17:10:00.000Z	matevz	Enselic	If there is a service running you don't want to shut down, it probably performs /var/log messages anyway
2006-11-20T17:10:00.000Z	Enselic	matevz	My scenario: started long make build, want to filter it trhough grep in the middle of it
2006-11-20T17:13:00.000Z	matevz	Enselic	you can cancel this
2006-11-20T17:13:00.000Z	matevz	Enselic	make will continue where it stopped
2006-11-20T17:13:00.000Z	matevz		(it should)
2006-11-20T17:14:00.000Z	matevz		except, if you wrote the Makefile manually and it's not something ordinary
2006-11-20T17:14:00.000Z	Enselic	matevz	That is true, though it would be nice if there was a way
2006-11-20T17:14:00.000Z	Enselic	matevz	It feels like it should be possible, but what the heck
2006-11-20T17:14:00.000Z	Enselic	matevz	Thanks anyway
2006-11-20T17:17:00.000Z	matevz	Enselic	no problem
