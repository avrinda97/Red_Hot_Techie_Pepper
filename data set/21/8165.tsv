2006-07-09T05:44:00.000Z	SonicChao	mcphail	yes it is...
2006-07-09T05:49:00.000Z	mcphail	SonicChao	compiz doesn't use much cpu
2006-07-09T05:52:00.000Z	mcphail	SonicChao	not sure if it is GPL, but it is certainly open source. Novell are becoming the good guys.
2006-07-09T05:53:00.000Z	SonicChao	mcphail	Ok...just was curious...I like vieweing source as a hobby :D
2006-07-09T05:54:00.000Z	SonicChao	mcphail	Especially of the most interesting programs...
2006-07-09T05:54:00.000Z	mcphail	SonicChao	a very worthy hobby ;)
2006-07-09T05:55:00.000Z	SonicChao	mcphail	Just starting learning...can't debug stuff yet...
2006-07-09T05:55:00.000Z	SonicChao	mcphail	I like Open Source 'cause it is a good resource for code...
2006-07-09T05:59:00.000Z	mcphail	SonicChao	xgl is not gpl, but source is free. See http://webcvs.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/xorg/hw/xgl/xgl.h?revision=1.19.2.1&view=markup&pathrev=xgl-0-0-1
2006-07-09T06:00:00.000Z	SonicChao	mcphail	Oh, thanks. I wonder what language that is in...:)
2006-07-09T06:01:00.000Z	SonicChao	mcphail	probably C...
2006-07-09T06:01:00.000Z	mcphail	SonicChao	looks like plain old C to me
2006-08-23T05:54:00.000Z	SonicChao	mcphail	Not everyone's. Mine runs fine.
2006-08-23T05:54:00.000Z	mcphail	SonicChao	eyequeue: what hardware are you running?
2006-08-23T05:55:00.000Z	SonicChao	mcphail	HP dv1411se
2006-08-23T05:55:00.000Z	mcphail	SonicChao	it is the stable branch of the distribution. This sort of thing shouldn't happen
2006-08-23T05:57:00.000Z	SonicChao	mcphail	It shouldn't happen, but everyone makes mistakes. There is also no warranty, and weeks/months of testing doesn't happen.
2006-08-23T05:57:00.000Z	mcphail	SonicChao	i have never installed a piece of software which has a warranty :)
2006-08-23T05:58:00.000Z	mcphail	SonicChao	ubuntu is getting a reputation for these mistakes
2006-08-23T05:58:00.000Z	SonicChao	mcphail	Well, there are problems, but everyone needs to take a chill pill.
