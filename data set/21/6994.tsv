2006-12-21T09:22:00.000Z	iamelite		But i do know... I completly wiped windows out.
2006-12-21T09:23:00.000Z	iamelite		Im total linux and a noob. This will be interesting how i will be forced to learn new things.
2006-12-21T09:24:00.000Z	iamelite		hdd1 means hard drive D partition 1. Im guessing?
2006-12-21T09:25:00.000Z	yairgo	iamelite	yes
2006-12-21T09:25:00.000Z	yairgo		i guess i could just use it normal oh well
2006-12-21T09:26:00.000Z	iamelite		then sda1 means serial drive/disk A partition 1. But then with hdd1 what is hdd a-c?
2006-12-21T09:26:00.000Z	iamelite		wait hddc is cdrom/DvD i know that... a + b still makes no sence
2006-12-21T09:26:00.000Z	yairgo		you have hdd a-c or do you have hd a-c?
2006-12-21T09:26:00.000Z	iamelite		hd a-c what i meant
2006-12-21T09:27:00.000Z	iamelite		hdc*
2006-12-21T09:27:00.000Z	iamelite		Meh, forget it.
2006-12-21T09:27:00.000Z	iamelite		k thx guys
2006-12-21T09:27:00.000Z	yairgo	iamelite	so you only have 2 drives, a serial and one ide?
2006-12-21T09:27:00.000Z	iamelite		yes yairgo man
2006-12-21T09:28:00.000Z	iamelite		well... one Sata, one IDE disk and the DvD writer
2006-12-21T09:28:00.000Z	iamelite		dvd writerr is on IDE channel
2006-12-21T09:28:00.000Z	yairgo	iamelite	is it a slave drive?
2006-12-21T09:28:00.000Z	iamelite	yairgo	the IDE hard disk (NTFS ddrive) is a slave to the DvD
2006-12-21T09:29:00.000Z	yairgo	iamelite	then you do not have a a and b because they would be your first two, it is D because it is a slave and your DVD is taking up C
2006-12-21T09:30:00.000Z	yairgo	iamelite	do you only have one ide cable or something?
2006-12-21T09:32:00.000Z	iamelite	yairgo	all my stuff is at my exs. Cables... cards... drives. Very sad but i made due with what i had.
