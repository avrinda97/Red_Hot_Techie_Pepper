2009-07-25T14:48:00.000Z	BiggBoss		hello. one question: I runned this cmd (sudo apt-get install sun-java6-bin sun-java6-jre sun-java6-jdk). It says me java is his latest version and when i type java -version it says me no such file or direcotry
2009-07-25T14:48:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	BiggBoss	type java and hit TAB once or twice
2009-07-25T14:50:00.000Z	BiggBoss	TheMusicGuy	i did and i got some .directories and files
2009-07-25T14:51:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	BiggBoss	what does    ls /usr/bin | grep java  say?
2009-07-25T14:53:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	BiggBoss	huh. so the compiler is there, but the runner is not?
2009-07-25T15:07:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	BiggBoss	you need to use --install, I think, not -install
2009-07-25T15:08:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	BiggBoss	most of the time, whole-word command line options are prefixed with a -- (two hyphens) and single letter options with - (one hyphen)
2009-07-25T15:13:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	BiggBoss	you installed the package openjdk-6-jre?
2009-07-25T15:15:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	BiggBoss	on my system, java is linked to /etc/alternatives/java, which is further linked to /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/jre/bin/java
2009-07-25T15:17:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	BiggBoss	the main graphical package manager for Ubuntu
2009-07-25T15:17:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	BiggBoss	those aren't folders. those are options from the gnome menu.
2009-07-25T15:20:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	BiggBoss	from the sun website you mean?
2009-07-25T15:20:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	BiggBoss	Don't they have instructions there for that?
2009-07-25T15:21:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	BiggBoss	that installer does not use Ubuntu's package management system.
2009-07-25T15:22:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	BiggBoss	the .bin from Sun's website its an executable binary. You have to give it executable permissions.
2009-07-25T15:22:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	BiggBoss	yes, then go the directory that contains it and then type ./whateveritis.bin
2009-07-25T15:23:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	BiggBoss	uploading synaptic to the machine? what?
2009-07-25T15:23:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	BiggBoss	oh, so you don't have graphical access?
2009-07-25T15:24:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	BiggBoss	in that case, synaptic is no use to you.
2009-07-25T15:25:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	BiggBoss	the closest thing to synaptic if you only have command line access is aptitude
2009-07-25T15:26:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	BiggBoss	otherwise, run aptitude and type / to start searching for packages by name.
