2009-11-22T09:22:00.000Z	pieces		So I have two desktops, one is sharing files and the other is able to access all the shares except the ones on an external drive.  When I try to access these it says "Unable to mount windows share"  Can someone please help?

2009-11-22T09:29:00.000Z	ZupZupper	pieces	do you have another system you can test the shares with?
2009-11-22T09:35:00.000Z	pieces	ZupZupper	yeah I just tried with my laptop, ubuntu 9.04 i get the same message
2009-11-22T09:36:00.000Z	pieces	ZupZupper	I have tried unsharing and resharing too and that hasnt worked wither
2009-11-22T09:36:00.000Z	ZupZupper	pieces	smbmount //servername/sharename /mountdirectory -o username=mywindowsusername,password=mywindowspassword
2009-11-22T09:37:00.000Z	pieces	ZupZupper	its an open share do i still need user name and stuff?
2009-11-22T09:37:00.000Z	ZupZupper	pieces	nah try without it
2009-11-22T09:37:00.000Z	ZupZupper	pieces	if that fails, use a username and pass, see if it succeeds
2009-11-22T09:38:00.000Z	pieces	ZupZupper	so just smbmount //servername/sharename /mountdirectory -o
2009-11-22T09:39:00.000Z	ZupZupper	pieces	you don't need the -o
2009-11-22T09:42:00.000Z	pieces	ZupZupper	mount error: can not change directory into mount target /mnt/Videos
2009-11-22T09:43:00.000Z	ZupZupper	pieces	whats the whole command you ran?

2009-11-22T09:44:00.000Z	ZupZupper	pieces	does /mnt/Videos exist locally?
2009-11-22T09:44:00.000Z	pieces	ZupZupper	no, just /mnt
