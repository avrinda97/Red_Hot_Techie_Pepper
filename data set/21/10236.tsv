2006-07-27T14:30:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	jordan_	that would depend on what sort of games you like.  there are thousands
2006-07-27T14:31:00.000Z	jordan_	Samus_Aran	My Favorites are Rp3's and Adventure games (also platformers) But I like others
2006-07-27T14:31:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	jordan_	if you like first person 3D, anything by Id Software is available natively for GNU/Linux (Quake 1-4, Doom 1-3, RTCW,  Enemy-Territory, etc.)
2006-07-27T14:32:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	jordan_	well if you don't mind a lack of graphics, no role playing game quite compares to Ancient Domains Of Mystery (ADOM), in my opinion.
2006-07-27T14:33:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	jordan_	numerous emulators work, if you have a decently fast system.  e.g. SNES, N64, PlayStation
2006-07-27T14:33:00.000Z	jordan_	Samus_Aran	 Well i do have snes9x I guess i could find a Rpg for it.
2006-07-27T14:34:00.000Z	jordan_	Samus_Aran	 theres a n64 emu for linux
2006-07-27T14:34:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	jordan_	I recommend ZSNES, personally.  more features than SNES9x
2006-07-27T14:34:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	jordan_	there are several N64 emus, Mupen64 is the best native client, as well, some of them such as UltraHLE work in WINE
2006-07-27T14:35:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	jordan_	Mupen64 is quite slow, though, so you need a fast CPU (3000+ AMD or so for many of the games, slower for some others)
2006-07-27T14:35:00.000Z	jordan_	Samus_Aran	Is Mupen64 in apt?
2006-07-27T14:35:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	jordan_	not sure, haven't checked since switching to Ubuntu
2006-07-27T14:35:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	jordan_	http://mupen64.emulation64.com/
2006-07-27T14:37:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	jordan_	you should give ADOM a try if you can get past lack of graphics.  it uses 16-colour ASCII for its maps.  has a great plot, character development, moral choices, numerous quests and places to explore, skills, attributes, talents and a ton of other configurability.
2006-07-27T14:37:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	jordan_	I've been playing ADOM off and on for more than 8 years now and still love it
2006-07-27T14:38:00.000Z	Samus_Aran		so does anyone know how to get a dictionary working in OO.o 2.x ?
2006-07-27T14:38:00.000Z	jordan_	Samus_Aran	Is it on apt?
2006-07-27T14:38:00.000Z	jordan_	Samus_Aran	 i can still install it but i love apt
2006-07-27T14:41:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	jordan_	nope, not in apt, as it is closed source.  its developed by a single person over many, many years.  has clients for win/dos, mac, gnu/linux and beos
2006-07-27T14:43:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	jordan_	http://www.adom.de/ if you want to check it out
