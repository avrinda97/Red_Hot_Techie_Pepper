2007-05-29T16:07:00.000Z	lina_		hi, i had my computer upgraded to ubuntu feisty from edgy by my bf, was working fine for a few days but now i can't connect to the internet through my router and the graphical display won't start (this is a spare computer i'm using)
2007-05-29T16:08:00.000Z	shiester_miester	lina_	you could also just reinstall ubuntu
2007-05-29T16:08:00.000Z	shiester_miester		when gnome is broken, i found it difficult to fix
2007-05-29T16:08:00.000Z	lina_	shiester_miester	i don't know how
2007-05-29T16:09:00.000Z	shiester_miester	lina_	that could be a problem
2007-05-29T16:09:00.000Z	lina_	shiester_miester	and whats to stop it happening again after a couplel of days? there was no apparant reason.. was watchin a film last night and this morning it doesn't work
2007-05-29T16:09:00.000Z	shiester_miester		thats true
2007-05-29T16:10:00.000Z	lina_		when it loads it has a blue screen with characters around the edge and some error output.. says something about a stack trace
2007-05-29T16:10:00.000Z	lina_		and if i want to view some other output as well..
2007-05-29T16:10:00.000Z	shiester_miester	lina_	try disabling the automatic updates...it could have installed something that broke it
2007-05-29T16:10:00.000Z	lina_	shiester_miester	where do i do that?
2007-05-29T16:11:00.000Z	shiester_miester		well you need to be in ubuntu, which you cant since then GUI is broken
2007-05-29T16:11:00.000Z	shiester_miester		what i mean is, re-install ubuntu and stop it from automatically updating itself
2007-05-29T16:11:00.000Z	lina_	shiester_miester	ok
2007-05-29T16:11:00.000Z	lina_		will see if i have a cd
2007-05-29T16:11:00.000Z	lina_		if thats the only option
2007-05-29T16:11:00.000Z	lina_		it's a very nice computer though.. should be better than this :(
2007-05-29T16:12:00.000Z	shiester_miester	lina_	you can have the most expensive computer in the world and software will still crash
2007-05-29T16:12:00.000Z	shiester_miester		thats like saying that cars wont crash if you make roads properly :P
2007-05-29T16:12:00.000Z	lina_		ok
2007-05-29T16:12:00.000Z	lina_	shiester_miester	thanks
