2004-12-14T15:35:00.000Z	confrey	thoreauputic	I have a USB card reader, I use with it a 256 MB SD, I can view its contents, but I can't write files on it as user, only as root

2004-12-14T15:40:00.000Z	thoreauputic	confrey	I'm not up on USB  stuff - maybe someone else can help you
2004-12-14T15:40:00.000Z	thoreauputic	confrey	it's probably just a matter of changing the permissions on the device
2004-12-16T15:39:00.000Z	thoreauputic	confrey	have you tried setting it with the hdparm utility?
2004-12-16T15:47:00.000Z	confrey	thoreauputic	I don't know how to set it with hdparm; I currently use hdparm to tuen hdisk in regard of I/O and multicount, how to change udma mode?
2004-12-16T15:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic	confrey	I don't recall offhand, but I know it's possible with one of the switches: it's in the manual anyway (sorry that isn't meant to be a RTFM :) )
2004-12-16T15:49:00.000Z	thoreauputic	confrey	maybe open man hdparm and do a search - /dma ?
2004-12-16T15:50:00.000Z	thoreauputic	confrey	sorry  /udma
2004-12-16T15:50:00.000Z	confrey	thoreauputic	I saw in google there are many warnings about using hdparm's switches; I read about some dangerous uses of X switch
2004-12-16T15:51:00.000Z	confrey	thoreauputic	and about a man browser for X? in kde it's simple : #manpage in konqueror; why not in gnome?
2004-12-16T15:52:00.000Z	thoreauputic	confrey	hmm... yes there is some risk I believe: it hasn't broken anything here though - and if you know your hard drive's capabilities you should be OK
2004-12-16T15:54:00.000Z	thoreauputic	confrey	hmmm - it's an issue: it used to call yelp but jdub or someone was saying it needs to be fixed in gnome
2004-12-16T15:54:00.000Z	thoreauputic	confrey	I mean the man function
2004-12-16T15:57:00.000Z	thoreauputic	confrey	in gnome 2.4 ( what I'm using here on debian) , entering man:hdparm in galeon opens the gnome help browser
2004-12-16T16:00:00.000Z	confrey	thoreauputic	I don't know why I can open the normal browser in ubuntu : each dir is opened in a new window, and I can't see the tree structure on the left hand... why?
2004-12-16T16:01:00.000Z	thoreauputic	confrey	it's called "spatial" - you can chnge it in nautilus to "browser" mode
2004-12-16T16:01:00.000Z	confrey	thoreauputic	so what do I have to do? do I have to run nautilus?
2004-12-16T16:02:00.000Z	thoreauputic	confrey	^^^
2004-12-16T16:03:00.000Z	thoreauputic	confrey	but don't address all your questions to me
2004-12-16T16:03:00.000Z	confrey	thoreauputic	OK! thanks
