2005-11-26T13:19:00.000Z	orborde_		Xfce is an interesting beastie. Quite nice, I say.
2005-11-26T13:20:00.000Z	n0dl	orborde_	i got xfce on a clean install ( i installed Xfce as my main GUI with out ever installing GNOME first)
2005-11-26T13:21:00.000Z	orborde_	n0dl	How'd you do that?
2005-11-26T13:26:00.000Z	orborde_	n0dl	Why not just apt-get install xfce4 ?
2005-11-26T13:27:00.000Z	orborde_	n0dl	Shouldn't it automatically grab X as a dependency when you grab xfce4 ... ?
2005-11-26T13:28:00.000Z	n0dl	orborde_	Not that I am aware of
2005-11-26T13:29:00.000Z	orborde_	n0dl	Openbox?
2005-11-26T13:29:00.000Z	n0dl	orborde_	yeah its originally a WDM (window manager) and was some deviation from black box
2005-11-26T13:30:00.000Z	orborde_	n0dl	Oh, I see about the X server. You don't actually need an X server on the machine you run the apps on; you can just redirect the clients across the LAN. Linux is so awesome....
2005-11-26T13:32:00.000Z	orborde_	n0dl	Not to be dumb, but have you ever heard of autocomplete? :)
2005-11-26T13:32:00.000Z	orborde_	n0dl	What IRC client are you on?

2005-11-26T13:33:00.000Z	orborde_	n0dl	It makes everyone's lives easier. Now I don't have to pick your messages out of the mess when you misspell my name :)
2005-11-26T13:59:00.000Z	orborde_	n0dl	w00t for lynx :)
2005-11-26T14:02:00.000Z	orborde_	n0dl	They are two different things
2005-11-26T14:02:00.000Z	orborde_	n0dl	lynx is more stipped-down
