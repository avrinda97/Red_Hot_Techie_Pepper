2007-12-27T01:14:00.000Z	iDope		what to do if my sound suddenly stopped working after a kernel upgrade
2007-12-27T01:14:00.000Z	iDope		?
2007-12-27T01:14:00.000Z	iDope		im pretty sure i didn't touch the sound card related section from my previous config
2007-12-27T01:15:00.000Z	iDope		the volume applet says that my card is not configured
2007-12-27T01:15:00.000Z	iDope		I have a Conexant HD Audio device
2007-12-27T01:16:00.000Z	iDope		do I need to compile some module or something?
2007-12-27T01:16:00.000Z	wols	iDope	snd-hda-intel still loaded?
2007-12-27T01:18:00.000Z	wols	iDope	please leearn to read what I wrote
2007-12-27T01:20:00.000Z	wols	iDope	uname -a
2007-12-27T01:21:00.000Z	wols	iDope	uname -a
2007-12-27T01:22:00.000Z	wols	iDope	this is no ubuntu kernel
2007-12-27T01:23:00.000Z	wols	iDope	the fact that you didn't compile sound drivers proves that you don't know at all
2007-12-27T01:24:00.000Z	wols	iDope	and you are very lucky it even booted
2007-12-27T01:25:00.000Z	wols	iDope	grep CONFIG_SND_HDA_INTEL /boot/config-2.6.23
2007-12-27T01:25:00.000Z	wols	iDope	grep CONFIG_SND_HDA_INTEL /boot/config-2.6.23*
2007-12-27T01:28:00.000Z	wols	iDope	so what does it say?
2007-12-27T01:29:00.000Z	wols	iDope	run menuconfig, enable the alsa stuff and whatever else and run make-kpkg again
2007-12-27T01:29:00.000Z	wols	iDope	imho when you want a custom kernel, make a custom one. not a copy of the distro kernel. what's the point?
2007-12-27T01:29:00.000Z	wols	iDope	run make-kpkg again. mostly only this module yes
2007-12-27T01:32:00.000Z	wols	iDope	ubuntu kernel has patches, kernel.org source doesn't, might have made a difference
2007-12-27T01:33:00.000Z	wols	iDope	anytime
