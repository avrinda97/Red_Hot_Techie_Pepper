2011-04-09T19:30:00.000Z	kwtm	damno__	Thanks ... I thought that just said which have already been installed? Does that tell me which have not yet been installed?
2011-04-09T19:31:00.000Z	damno__		all
2011-04-09T19:31:00.000Z	damno__		on your desktop the file will be created
2011-04-09T19:32:00.000Z	kwtm	damno__	Was that "all" intended for me?  What can I do to filter in only the ones which still have to be installed?  I'm trying to see whether I have enough bandwidth to "apt-get dselect-upgrade" all these packages or whether I have to pick and choose manually.
2011-04-09T19:32:00.000Z	damno__	kwtm	 u may see http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1580857
2011-04-09T19:33:00.000Z	damno__		ok , keep the file on another systems desktop; and then if you run   dpkg --set-selections < installed-software   the uninstalled ones will be installed
2011-04-09T19:33:00.000Z	damno__		@kwtm,
2011-04-09T19:34:00.000Z	damno__	kwtm	 got it?
2011-04-09T19:34:00.000Z	kwtm	damno__	I have read through the first half of it, and it still does not address my question.  I just did the dpkg --set-selections <PreviousFile but due to an intermittent connection, not all packages were upgraded.  Now I want to know which packages are left to be installed.
2011-04-09T19:34:00.000Z	kwtm	damno__	No, I should clarify my question.  I am *not* trying to install all the uninstalled software.  I already know how to do that.
2011-04-09T19:35:00.000Z	damno__	kwtm	then what do u want
2011-04-09T19:35:00.000Z	kwtm	damno__	I want to know, *if/when* I install "all uninstalled software left to be installed"  (via the "apt-get dselect-upgrade" command), WHICH packages will be installed.
2011-04-09T19:35:00.000Z	kwtm	damno__	For example, is there some "apt-cache policy all" and then I pipe it through "grep needs-to-be-installed" or something?
2011-04-09T19:36:00.000Z	damno__	kwtm	sorry, I never tryed those
2011-04-09T19:37:00.000Z	kwtm	damno__	Ok, no problem.  I see from the dpkg man page that it can list package status.  Can I somehow list the status of all the packages instead of specifying a package name?
2011-04-09T19:37:00.000Z	damno__	kwtm	 what do u mean by this "all uninstalled software left to be installed" ?
2011-04-09T19:37:00.000Z	kwtm	damno__	Ok, nm, I found it ... it's "dpkg --yet-to-unpack"
2011-04-09T19:38:00.000Z	damno__		ok,  time to go.
2011-04-09T19:38:00.000Z	kwtm	damno__	I have selected (say) 100 packages to be installed, and did "apt-get dselect-upgrade".  In the middle of this, my connection went bad.  Then it went back up.  So, only 75 packages were installed (let's say).  So now there are 25 packages left to be installed.  I want to know WHICH 25 packages are marked for install but were not installed due to the bad connection.
2011-04-09T19:38:00.000Z	kwtm	damno__	Thanks for your help.
