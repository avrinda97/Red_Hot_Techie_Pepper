2010-10-02T18:18:00.000Z	coz_	cool-aide	 what all did you change on the system?
2010-10-02T18:19:00.000Z	coz_	cool-aide	  if you mean reset gnome   you can do that without ubuntu tweak
2010-10-02T18:20:00.000Z	coz_	cool-aide	 if you mean compiz  then that can be done from ccsm
2010-10-02T18:20:00.000Z	coz_	cool-aide	 if you want gnome reset  use this command     sudo rm -rf .gnome .gnome2 .gconf .gconfd .metacity      hen restart X
2010-10-02T18:21:00.000Z	cool-aide	coz_	doing that...is it safe for my files? i mean i got conky runnin too...and i got doc files... is it safe?
2010-10-02T18:22:00.000Z	coz_	cool-aide	 should be safe for conky...that command is to reset "gnome"  not application options
2010-10-02T18:24:00.000Z	coz_	cool-aide	 did you restart x
2010-10-02T18:25:00.000Z	coz_	cool-aide	 you have to restart x  or reboot in order to see the changes
