2006-04-12T11:25:00.000Z	goofrider	tonyyarusso	re: USB stick. I'd copy all the files on the live cd to the USB stick then install SYSLINUX
2006-04-12T11:25:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	goofrider	I need it under 128M, btw.  How would I go about "install SYSLINUX"?
2006-04-12T11:26:00.000Z	goofrider	tonyyarusso	SYSLINUX is a bootloader just like lilo and grub, but simpler
2006-04-12T11:27:00.000Z	goofrider	tonyyarusso	and I don't thinnk u can readily strip the Ubuntu live CD down
2006-04-12T11:27:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	goofrider	Ah.  Wiki reference for doing it perhaps?
2006-04-12T11:27:00.000Z	goofrider	tonyyarusso	go to the SYSLINUX homepage. ask google
2006-04-12T11:27:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	goofrider	There's a wiki page about customizing it, so it can be done, but it sounded complicated.
2006-04-12T11:28:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	goofrider	Okay.
2006-04-12T11:28:00.000Z	goofrider	tonyyarusso	customizing the live cd would be pretty involved
2006-04-12T11:28:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	goofrider	That's what it sounded like.
2006-04-12T11:28:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	goofrider	It would be nice if I could pick and choose more easily somehow.
2006-04-12T11:28:00.000Z	goofrider	tonyyarusso	u might as well copy a live Ubuntu HDD install onto the USB stick and use UnionFS (YMMV)
2006-04-12T11:29:00.000Z	goofrider	tonyyarusso	if u want a modular live CD, try slax
2006-04-12T11:29:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	goofrider	Whoa, okay, that went over my head.  live HDD install?  Isn't that redundant?  Don't recognize UnionFS or "YMMV" either.
2006-04-12T11:30:00.000Z	goofrider	tonyyarusso	well, try slax if u want modular or Damn Small Linux if u want small
2006-04-12T11:30:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	goofrider	Bah, not redundant.  Contradictory I meant.
2006-04-12T11:31:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	goofrider	DSL didn't work though, which is why I was hoping for Ubuntu's hardware detection.
2006-04-12T11:31:00.000Z	goofrider	tonyyarusso	the live CD is an read-only image of a live HDD install
2006-04-12T11:31:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	goofrider	Ah.
2006-04-12T11:31:00.000Z	goofrider	tonyyarusso	so in order to create a custom one, u have to have a live HDD install working  :)
2006-04-12T11:32:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	goofrider	Okay.
