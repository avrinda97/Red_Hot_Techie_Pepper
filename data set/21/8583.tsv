2006-03-12T12:57:00.000Z	faded_		hi, I don't have the correct permissions to write to files in my homedir, I get permission denied errors. How can I fix this?
2006-03-12T12:57:00.000Z	LjL	faded_	"sudo chown yourusername filename"
2006-03-12T12:58:00.000Z	faded_	LjL	it appears to be all files in my homedir, is there a recursive option?
2006-03-12T12:58:00.000Z	LjL	faded_	"chown -R yourusername *"
2006-03-12T12:59:00.000Z	faded_	LjL	thanks. do you have any idea why I don't have permission? I can't even mv or rm files that I own..
2006-03-12T12:59:00.000Z	LjL	faded_	i dunno. what does "ls -l filename" show on such files?
2006-03-12T13:00:00.000Z	faded_	LjL	it shows that I am the owner of all files
2006-03-12T13:00:00.000Z	LjL	faded_	what about the permissions?
2006-03-12T13:00:00.000Z	faded_	LjL	everything is chmod 775 at least
2006-03-12T13:01:00.000Z	LjL	faded_	what about the permissions/ownership of the parent directory?
2006-03-12T13:01:00.000Z	faded_	LjL	directory /home/username is dr-xr-xr-x
2006-03-12T13:02:00.000Z	faded_	LjL	I am in the failsafe at the moment, as gnome doesnt load. just kicks me back to the login prompt
2006-03-12T13:02:00.000Z	LjL	faded_	i think there's a "w" missing there for the owner
2006-03-12T13:02:00.000Z	LjL	faded_	my home directories are drwxr-xr-x
2006-03-12T13:03:00.000Z	faded_	LjL	i see ok, i'll give it a try thanks
2006-03-12T13:07:00.000Z	faded_	LjL	the fourth column in the ls -l display, is that the creator or owner?
2006-03-12T13:07:00.000Z	LjL	faded_	owner
2006-03-12T13:08:00.000Z	LjL	faded_	wait a moment, *fourth* column? that's neither. that's the group
2006-03-12T13:08:00.000Z	faded_	LjL	I see, because a few of the directories have that as root
2006-03-12T13:09:00.000Z	faded_	LjL	also what is the default chmod for a directory?
2006-03-12T13:09:00.000Z	LjL	faded_	you should probably change that to your user, for files in your home. though it shouldn't really hurt. (note that there are groups with the same name as users, by default)
