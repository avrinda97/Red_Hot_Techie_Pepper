2009-09-16T00:31:00.000Z	hedkandi		what does this mean?
2009-09-16T00:31:00.000Z	hedkandi		python-qt4:
2009-09-16T00:31:00.000Z	hedkandi		  Depends: python-central (>=0.6.7) but 0.6.5ubuntu1 is to be installed
2009-09-16T00:31:00.000Z	LjL	hedkandi	it means that the package python-qt4 depends on version 0.6.7 or above of python-central, but the rest of the system requires 0.6.5ubuntu1 for some reason
2009-09-16T00:32:00.000Z	LjL	hedkandi	what version of ubuntu are you on?
2009-09-16T00:33:00.000Z	LjL	hedkandi	do you have any non-default respositories enabled?
2009-09-16T00:34:00.000Z	LjL	hedkandi	like what, for instance?
2009-09-16T00:35:00.000Z	LjL	hedkandi	do you have backports enabled?
2009-09-16T00:35:00.000Z	LjL	hedkandi	it's a repository (containing "back-ported" software)
2009-09-16T00:36:00.000Z	LjL	hedkandi	actually, do you even have the "updates" repositories enabled? (you should, but you might not)
2009-10-16T03:51:00.000Z	LjL	hedkandi	##networking i assume?
2009-10-26T06:02:00.000Z	LjL	hedkandi	you certainly are
2009-11-28T04:53:00.000Z	LjL	hedkandi	"exit"
2009-11-28T04:54:00.000Z	LjL	hedkandi	why?
2009-11-28T04:55:00.000Z	LjL	hedkandi	not true.
2009-11-28T04:55:00.000Z	LjL	hedkandi	1) by default, sudo is configured to not ask the password again for about 15 minutes
2009-11-28T04:55:00.000Z	LjL	hedkandi	2) you can type "sudo -i" and then go on with your commands, if you know that you'll need to be root for a while
2009-11-28T04:55:00.000Z	LjL	hedkandi	it can be changed, although it seems plenty of time to me
2009-11-28T04:56:00.000Z	LjL	hedkandi	and also so much more foolish and dangerous
2009-11-28T04:56:00.000Z	hedkandi	LjL	the word is "convenient"
2009-11-28T04:57:00.000Z	LjL	hedkandi	stupid things like running an IRC client as root?
