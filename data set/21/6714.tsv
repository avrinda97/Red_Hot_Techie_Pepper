2007-02-11T17:20:00.000Z	mynick	Yodude	expert users actually never see errors like yours ... how can you blame the os for your decisions?
2007-02-11T17:21:00.000Z	mynick	Yodude	i missed ethe original question ... what happened again?
2007-02-11T17:22:00.000Z	Yodude	mynick	after downloading nvidia-glx from the repository it instaslled and corrupted X
2007-02-11T17:23:00.000Z	mynick	Yodude	oh its not a corruption ... either a config error or something wrong with driver
2007-02-11T17:24:00.000Z	mynick	Yodude	x doesn't boot right, it brings up a blue or red screen right?
2007-02-11T17:24:00.000Z	mynick	Yodude	uninstall it and do sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and choose the vesa driver
2007-02-11T17:25:00.000Z	mynick	Yodude	make SURE to backup your xorg.conf file first
