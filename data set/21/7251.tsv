2006-11-03T14:16:00.000Z	ippa		beeing totally new to ubuntu .. what kind of timeframe can one expect to get a bug like https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-ati/+bug/22985 fixed?
2006-11-03T14:17:00.000Z	ippa		it's currently the showstopper for my first ubuntuinstall
2006-11-03T14:18:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	ippa	how can it be a showstopper if it can be fixed through simplet xorg.conf editing?
2006-11-03T14:19:00.000Z	ippa	nolimitsoya	it is? read all ppls descriptions of the bug without seeing a sollution
2006-11-03T14:20:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	ippa	i see someone claiming to have a fix in the first post...
2006-11-03T14:20:00.000Z	ippa	nolimitsoya	to make it clear, it's a totally new install.. I boot the CD, choose first alternative "install" .. and it dies (black screen) after 2 m ins.
2006-11-03T14:20:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	ippa	use the alternate install cd, and do a text mode install
2006-11-03T14:21:00.000Z	ippa	nolimitsoya	where's this "alternative" install-cd?
2006-11-03T14:22:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	ippa	on the ubuntu mirrors, right with the desktop cd :)
2006-11-03T14:22:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	ippa	one moment, ill get youa link
2006-11-03T14:23:00.000Z	ippa	nolimitsoya	think I got it
2006-11-03T14:23:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	ippa	http://ubuntu.cs.utah.edu/releases/edgy/ubuntu-6.10-alternate-i386.iso
2006-11-03T14:25:00.000Z	ippa	nolimitsoya	there's no way to use the orig-install-cd but get thoose lines into the conf before graphic install starts?
2006-11-03T14:25:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	ippa	no
2006-11-03T14:29:00.000Z	ippa	nolimitsoya	omg, I pasted the wrong bugpage ;) ... https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/linux-meta/+bug/67487
2006-11-03T14:29:00.000Z	ippa	nolimitsoya	something with edgy and ATI-cards
2006-11-03T14:31:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	ippa	still, get the alternate cd, use vesa if fglrx doesnt work
2006-11-03T14:41:00.000Z	ippa	nolimitsoya	seems like some ppl have solved it with the alternative CD yes.. but that's only in slow vesa mode (for others, that didn't work either) .. while it might be the way forward right now, do you have any oppinoun on how long a Critical ubuntubug takes to fix?
2006-11-03T14:42:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	ippa	that depends on how seious it is, but critical bugs are given a lot of manpower...
2006-11-03T14:42:00.000Z	ippa	nolimitsoya	right, it has been marked Critical.. so we're talking about maybe some days -> 1 week here?
2006-11-03T14:43:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	ippa	as i said, that depends on how hard it is to fix...
