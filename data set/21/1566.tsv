2010-10-24T08:20:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	jvm_	sudo apt-get install --reinstall php5-common
2010-10-24T08:21:00.000Z	jvm_	ilovefairuz	didn't change anything with the module activation problem.
2010-10-24T08:22:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	jvm_	did you generate a php.ini file by yourself?
2010-10-24T08:22:00.000Z	jvm_	ilovefairuz	the php.ini file was copied from a working debian system.
2010-10-24T08:23:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	jvm_	what ubuntu version are you running?
2010-10-24T08:23:00.000Z	jvm_	ilovefairuz	10.04
2010-10-24T08:24:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	jvm_	check /usr/share/php5/
2010-10-24T08:25:00.000Z	jvm_	ilovefairuz	there are php.ini-production files. should i use them?
2010-10-24T08:25:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	jvm_	yeap
2010-10-24T08:26:00.000Z	jvm_	ilovefairuz	after copying the production file to /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini and restarting apache, a search for "gd" in my phpinfo() output still shows up nothing.
2010-10-24T08:27:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	jvm_	sudo service apache2 force-reload
2010-10-24T08:27:00.000Z	jvm_	ilovefairuz	i used the init script itself, but still no change ;)
2010-10-24T08:28:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	jvm_	what's in /etc/php5/conf.d/ ?
2010-10-24T08:28:00.000Z	jvm_	ilovefairuz	nothing.
2010-10-24T08:29:00.000Z	jvm_	ilovefairuz	thanks for that idea.
2010-10-24T08:29:00.000Z	jvm_	ilovefairuz	on the debian system there are a number of files for the different plugins, apparently.
2010-10-24T08:29:00.000Z	jvm_	ilovefairuz	give me a minute to copy them and try again.
2010-10-24T08:30:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	jvm_	sudo apt-get purge php5-gd; sudo apt-get install php5-gd
2010-10-24T08:31:00.000Z	jvm_	ilovefairuz	thanks a lot! that did it.
2010-10-24T08:31:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	jvm_	you're welcome
2010-10-24T08:32:00.000Z	jvm_	ilovefairuz	have a nice day. also thanks to airtonix and HermanDE.
