2009-03-02T09:57:00.000Z	fallore	Zykotic	if you're busy i understand, but in case you just missed my last message i still need a tiny bit of help, but i feel like i'm really close to resolving this
2009-03-02T09:59:00.000Z	Zykotic	fallore	sorry man...  you have your working smb.conf backed up and your editing it now right?  and you don't see the section with the printers?
2009-03-02T09:59:00.000Z	fallore	Zykotic	i see the printer section
2009-03-02T10:04:00.000Z	Zykotic	fallore	do you see your currently shared folder somewhere?  cause you need to find that!  then copy it but change some of the details
2009-03-02T10:07:00.000Z	fallore	Zykotic	how do i copy a section of a file i'm looking at in nano?
2009-03-02T10:07:00.000Z	Zykotic	fallore	paper and pen if you have too, don't know the clipboard command in nano that's for sure; could do it in vi ;)
2009-03-02T10:08:00.000Z	fallore	Zykotic	how do i do it in vi? i'll try that instead
2009-03-02T10:08:00.000Z	Zykotic	fallore	nope vi is WAY too hard to explain accross irc
2009-03-02T10:09:00.000Z	fallore	Zykotic	is this what is creating those shared directories? http://pastebin.com/m39da5fba
2009-03-02T10:10:00.000Z	Zykotic	fallore	nope, not related at all
2009-03-02T10:10:00.000Z	fallore	Zykotic	that's the only thing that looks remotely related to actual shared directories. would it be helpful to just pastebin the whole file?
2009-03-02T10:11:00.000Z	Zykotic	fallore	but you should already have a share working don't you???
2009-03-02T10:11:00.000Z	fallore	Zykotic	yes
2009-03-02T10:11:00.000Z	Zykotic	fallore	so that share MUST be in your current config file???
2009-03-02T10:11:00.000Z	fallore	Zykotic	or at least, if i go into "my network places" on windows i can go into folders on the computer and see the contents.
2009-03-02T10:13:00.000Z	Zykotic	fallore	i don't understand???  but i don't think you should follow ANY of the pastebin directions as it will mess with your current working setup...
2009-03-02T10:14:00.000Z	Zykotic	fallore	the section under [writable] could be adapted to whatever samba share you could need...  but you really should see the share that's currently working in your smb.conf file???
2009-03-02T10:15:00.000Z	fallore	Zykotic	i'm pretty sure the first bit of what i pastebin'd to shares the user's home directory, so the \\htpc\xbmc share that i am seeing if a result of it
2009-03-02T10:19:00.000Z	fallore	Zykotic	how do i get out of the vi client without saving any changes?
2009-03-02T10:20:00.000Z	fallore	Zykotic	you just told me you couldn't explain it :P what does :q! mean
2009-03-02T10:20:00.000Z	Zykotic	fallore	sorry you may need to press ESC once, then the : key, then q, then !, then press enter (LOL)
