2010-03-31T07:54:00.000Z	al-tabq		well..if anyone got ideas on that, help would be appreciated
2010-03-31T07:56:00.000Z	chelz	al-tabq	might have to reboot
2010-03-31T07:56:00.000Z	al-tabq	chelz	tried already..
2010-03-31T07:57:00.000Z	chelz	al-tabq	you sure the fonts aren't in an archive or anything? and that they're in a format ubuntu supports?
2010-03-31T07:58:00.000Z	al-tabq	chelz	yea fc-cache logged that
2010-03-31T07:58:00.000Z	chelz	al-tabq	you could try the openoffice people. do the fonts show up in other places?
2010-03-31T07:59:00.000Z	al-tabq	chelz	gedit apparently recognizes them
2010-03-31T08:00:00.000Z	al-tabq	chelz	maybe i'll just wait it out, could be that it's just some random temporary bug
2010-03-31T08:01:00.000Z	chelz	al-tabq	did you look at the bottom and top of the openoffice font list? might be some strange ordering
2010-03-31T08:01:00.000Z	al-tabq	chelz	unfortunately not
2010-03-31T08:03:00.000Z	chelz	al-tabq	seems openoffice has its own places it searches for fonts and that place might not be one of them: http://www.openoffice.org/FAQs/fontguide.html#5
2010-03-31T08:07:00.000Z	al-tabq	chelz	that might be it, i copied mine in /usr/share/fonts/ it worked before though, but i'll try some other directory as well
2010-03-31T08:07:00.000Z	chelz	al-tabq	did it work before in this same version of ubuntu? and are you using OO.o from ubuntu?
2010-03-31T08:08:00.000Z	al-tabq	chelz	yea it worked before on other fonts, what's 00.o though?
2010-03-31T08:08:00.000Z	chelz	al-tabq	openoffice.org
2010-03-31T08:08:00.000Z	chelz	al-tabq	try talking to the ubuntu people
2010-03-31T08:08:00.000Z	al-tabq	chelz	ah alright, yea i do
2010-03-31T08:10:00.000Z	al-tabq	chelz	sheit, i figured it, the new fonts aren't truetype fonts but otf fonts
2010-03-31T08:10:00.000Z	chelz	al-tabq	aha, that would be it
2010-03-31T08:11:00.000Z	al-tabq	chelz	heheh yea, all the hustle for nothing.. i'll just convert them
2010-03-31T08:11:00.000Z	al-tabq	chelz	thanks a lot mate
