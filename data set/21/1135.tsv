2011-01-26T01:07:00.000Z	BGM_		hello!
2011-01-26T01:08:00.000Z	BGM_		Hi guys, so I discovered this awesome command called du; it tells me how much space stuff is taking on disk!
2011-01-26T01:08:00.000Z	BGM_		yeah
2011-01-26T01:08:00.000Z	BGM_		I'm wondering how to use it efficiently; like, I know there's a way to get stuff in order
2011-01-26T01:09:00.000Z	sageb1	BGM_	have u tried du -a and wondered why you can't find the file you want? :')
2011-01-26T01:09:00.000Z	sageb1	BGM_	less helps with a pipe (|)
2011-01-26T01:10:00.000Z	BGM_	sageb1	I just typed du and it spilled out a whole lot of stuff
2011-01-26T01:10:00.000Z	BGM_	sageb1	like this? du | less
2011-01-26T01:10:00.000Z	sageb1	BGM_	try suffixing it with  | less to make it page
2011-01-26T01:11:00.000Z	BGM_	sageb1	that's not helpful because I want it to be in order
2011-01-26T01:12:00.000Z	sageb1	BGM_	r u looking for files to purge? start by compressing your video files :)
2011-01-26T01:12:00.000Z	BGM_	sageb1	naaaaah, I don't have any videos, this is my account at my college and it's not very big
2011-01-26T01:12:00.000Z	sageb1	BGM_	you need: du -a | sort|less
2011-01-26T01:13:00.000Z	sageb1	BGM_	r u only in a text terminal, rather than shelling into the console from your desktop?
2011-01-26T01:14:00.000Z	BGM_	sageb1	ummmmm, I'm at the university but there's a GUI too if that's what you mean
2011-01-26T01:15:00.000Z	sageb1	BGM_	ok.  you must be in a virtual Ubuntu session under Xen...
2011-01-26T01:16:00.000Z	sageb1	BGM_	use firefox to delete  your cache
2011-01-26T01:17:00.000Z	sageb1	BGM_	firefox then will know its cache is deleted
2011-01-26T01:18:00.000Z	BGM_	sageb1	ok but it's complicated :(
2011-01-26T01:22:00.000Z	BGM_	sageb1	lol actually I was looking on the internets to try to find out how to delete my cache using firefox
2011-01-26T01:25:00.000Z	BGM_	sageb1	I don't see any Edit => Advanced...
