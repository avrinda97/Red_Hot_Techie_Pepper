2011-07-15T02:36:00.000Z	cg2916		 When I boot from my Live USB, it says it can't find a medium with a live file system
2011-07-15T02:37:00.000Z	byroncoughlin	cg2916	Where are you at on this?
2011-07-15T02:38:00.000Z	cg2916	byroncoughlin	I am on WIndows 7 if that's what you mean
2011-07-15T02:39:00.000Z	byroncoughlin	cg2916	I mean I saw you working on this earlier. Have you got any closer. What have you tried?
2011-07-15T02:39:00.000Z	cg2916	byroncoughlin	i've remade it with both unetbootin and universal usb installer, it didn't work
2011-07-15T02:41:00.000Z	byroncoughlin	cg2916	What error do you get when starting?
2011-07-15T02:41:00.000Z	cg2916	byroncoughlin	it says "Cannot find a medium with a live file system" then it switches to BusyBox. BTW, I've tried this on my other laptop, it works.
2011-07-15T02:42:00.000Z	byroncoughlin	cg2916	The same usb stick iso works on another laptop?
2011-07-15T02:42:00.000Z	cg2916	byroncoughlin	correct
2011-07-15T02:47:00.000Z	cg2916	byroncoughlin	are you there?
2011-07-15T02:48:00.000Z	byroncoughlin	cg2916	I believe this error means that you are getting to the kernel but there is a problem with the kernel going forward. What iso are you using?
2011-07-15T02:48:00.000Z	cg2916	byroncoughlin	lubuntu-11.04.iso
2011-07-15T02:49:00.000Z	byroncoughlin	cg2916	Have you tried any other iso?
2011-07-15T02:49:00.000Z	cg2916	byroncoughlin	what others are there?
2011-07-15T02:50:00.000Z	byroncoughlin	cg2916	maybe 10.10?
2011-07-15T02:51:00.000Z	cg2916	byroncoughlin	ok i'll try, also check private message
2011-07-15T03:16:00.000Z	cg2916	byroncoughlin	would it matter if i had extra files on my live usb
2011-07-15T03:17:00.000Z	byroncoughlin	cg2916	no it should not matter Should be looking for iso
2011-07-15T03:18:00.000Z	cg2916	byroncoughlin	ok, now should i extract the iso files onto the usb or just put the actual iso file
2011-07-15T03:39:00.000Z	byroncoughlin	cg2916	Do you have access to a llinux distro to create the bootable usb. Also have you tried pulling the stickout out and reinserting when you get to the error?
2011-07-15T03:39:00.000Z	cg2916	byroncoughlin	no and no
