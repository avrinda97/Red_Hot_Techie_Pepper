2010-12-20T01:13:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Sean93	you can't iirc, and the hacking required is more time consuming than using a browser, unless you have a account with direct access to the files
2010-12-20T01:15:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Sean93	i already answered that

2011-01-13T06:55:00.000Z	Sean93	aeon-ltd	only problem is the windows install is incredibly bloated and i suspect infected, almost impossible to do anything on it
2011-01-13T06:55:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Sean93	use anotherr pc as a hard drive host, install then move back
2011-01-13T06:56:00.000Z	Sean93	aeon-ltd	great idea
2011-01-13T06:56:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Sean93	but........?
2011-01-13T07:02:00.000Z	Sean93	aeon-ltd	no, i'm going to use it :P
2011-01-13T07:03:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Sean93	sorry the lack of 'tone' on the internet made me assume it was sarcastic, i apologise again
2011-01-13T07:03:00.000Z	Sean93	aeon-ltd	no problem :D
2011-01-13T07:04:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Sean93	btw hardware autodetect will be off, so you may need a lot of drivers/modules to be installed when you move back, in the worst case X may fail on boot - but you should have ubuntu
2011-01-14T03:38:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Sean93	what spec?
2011-01-14T03:38:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Sean93	oh wait did the thing work yesterday?
2011-01-14T03:39:00.000Z	Sean93	aeon-ltd	no i just installed it today, i was working but really slow then i updated the system and now i cant log in
2011-01-14T03:40:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Sean93	you may need lighter software, something like lubuntu should be ok. try to minimise resources in use; i know this is generally against the channels ethics but this may be one of the better options http://kmandla.wordpress.com/2011/01/03/mint-vs-lmde-sudden-weight-gain/
2011-01-14T03:42:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Sean93	it should
2011-01-14T03:42:00.000Z	Sean93	aeon-ltd	how do i start it without x?
2011-01-14T03:43:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Sean93	no idea, safe mode, then use that to remove gdm so X doesn't start on regular boot
