2007-08-27T05:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Bo3	Did you run it as root? ( with sudo ) ?
2007-08-27T05:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Bo3	What happened after you entered the needed information?
2007-08-27T05:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Bo3	What is wrong with it?
2007-08-27T05:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Bo3	I assume that it is not using the full resolution and so there is black to fill the extra space
2007-08-27T05:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Bo3	Why are you addressing me specifically?
2007-08-27T05:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Bo3	Just ask your question but don't address it to anyone specifically, if anyone can help they will
2007-08-27T05:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Bo3	What GFX card do you have?
2007-08-27T05:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Bo3	Did you ever say what Graphics card you have?
2007-08-27T05:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Bo3	Check in System -> Administration -> Restricted Driver Manager
2007-08-27T06:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Bo3	By the time you were through you would have to start over for the next release :)
2007-08-27T06:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Bo3	With Linux there is less of a seperation between "the OS" and applications that run "on top of" the OS, to get "everything that Ubuntu has to offer" you would have to download all the hundreds of thousands of packages / applications available :)
2007-08-27T06:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Bo3	Actually more like 21,000 but you get the point :)
2007-08-27T06:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Bo3	Your memory being full is a good thing, it means that data that you use frequently is kept in RAM, unused RAM is waisted RAM ( and the RAM will be reclaimed as soon as any application needs it )
2007-08-27T06:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Bo3	It sits in RAM not being used or it is taken out of RAM to make room for more important data
2007-08-27T06:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Bo3	I don't know, why would you want to?
2007-08-27T06:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Bo3	There is nothing wrong with things staying in RAM
2007-08-27T06:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Bo3	I am sure there is, but since there is no real reason for it it is probably not easy
