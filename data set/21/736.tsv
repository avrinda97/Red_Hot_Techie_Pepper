2011-09-10T20:10:00.000Z	zykotick9	ghabit	"sudo apt-get install chromium-browser" will install the open source one
2011-09-25T12:02:00.000Z	zykotick9	ghabit	i think "notification" is the key word, not pop-up

2012-10-16T01:46:00.000Z	zykotick9	ghabit	ask in #ubuntu+1 for 12.10 questions
2012-10-16T01:54:00.000Z	zykotick9	ghabit	check permissions.  "ls -l /media/e/tmp/gpodder-downloads"
2012-10-16T01:55:00.000Z	zykotick9	ghabit	only root and plugdev have permissions, other has none.
2012-10-16T01:55:00.000Z	ghabit	zykotick9	how I can grant access to minidlna?
2012-10-16T01:55:00.000Z	zykotick9	ghabit	can your user access it currently?  (are you a member of plugdev - use "groups" in terminal to check)
2012-10-16T02:07:00.000Z	ghabit	zykotick9	I can open this folder.
2012-10-16T02:09:00.000Z	zykotick9	ghabit	is this a fat or ntfs filesystem?
2012-10-16T02:10:00.000Z	ghabit	zykotick9	ntfs
2012-10-16T02:10:00.000Z	zykotick9	ghabit	sorry i can't help - good luck.
2012-10-16T02:17:00.000Z	ghabit	zykotick9	I don't know how it helps, but it helps - at /etc/fstab i have changed umask from 007 to 002, what it means?
2012-10-16T02:18:00.000Z	zykotick9	ghabit	that might work???  good luck.
2012-10-16T02:18:00.000Z	ghabit	zykotick9	it is working. Just tryed.
2012-10-16T02:18:00.000Z	ghabit	zykotick9	can you explain me what is 002?
2012-10-16T02:19:00.000Z	zykotick9	ghabit	umask is a subtraction from 777, so 002 should give 775
