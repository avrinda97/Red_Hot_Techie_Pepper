2006-11-16T13:51:00.000Z	oddballin	nolimitsoya	how would i do that? in termainl?  what is the path?
2006-11-16T13:51:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	oddballin	in a terminal: sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-11-16T13:51:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	oddballin	just add the resolution you want, using the old ones as a guide
2006-11-16T13:52:00.000Z	oddballin	nolimitsoya	got it... so i just change the mode numbers... from "1280 x 800" to something else.. but im not sure about depth?
2006-11-16T13:55:00.000Z	oddballin	nolimitsoya	you there?  i got it.. but what do i do with "depth" part?

2006-11-16T14:04:00.000Z	oddballin	nolimitsoya	would you be able to help me out more?  resizing the bar on top and bottom to smaller... its still big
2006-11-16T14:05:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	oddballin	im using xfce and dont know much about gnome, but couldnt you just right click them and select properties, or something?
2006-11-16T14:06:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	oddballin	yes it is. just right click any one if them
2006-11-16T14:07:00.000Z	oddballin	nolimitsoya	can you walk me thru it?  i dont see anything about resizing the bar... and hmm, what was the command again? sudo nano /etc/X11..?
2006-11-16T14:08:00.000Z	oddballin	nolimitsoya	nevermind, i found it... you just have to right-click on the bar itself

2006-11-16T14:34:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	oddballin	your home should be the first thing you are in when launching nautilus or a terminal
