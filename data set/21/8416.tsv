2006-12-14T10:51:00.000Z	AlexC_		How can I mount a FAT32 hard drive? I added it to my fstab but it doesn't show up when I type "mount" in terminal
2006-12-14T10:51:00.000Z	AlexC_		the hard drive is /dev/sdb1
2006-12-14T10:52:00.000Z	AlexC_		and I want it mounted to /media/windows
2006-12-14T10:53:00.000Z	igor_	AlexC_	mount -t vfat /dev/sdb1 /media/windows
2006-12-14T10:53:00.000Z	AlexC_	igor_	yeah I have created it
2006-12-14T10:54:00.000Z	AlexC_	igor_	I have it in my fstab - but when I looked in /media/windows there was _no files_ .... yet I know for a fact there are
2006-12-14T10:55:00.000Z	igor_	AlexC_	cd .. ; cd -\
2006-12-14T10:55:00.000Z	AlexC_	igor_	I get this: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdb1,
2006-12-14T10:55:00.000Z	AlexC_	igor_	/dev/sdb1 /media/windows vfat umask=0000 0 0
2006-12-14T10:56:00.000Z	igor_	AlexC_	everything seems fine..
2006-12-14T10:56:00.000Z	AlexC_	igor_	weird, I get wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdb1, again
2006-12-14T10:57:00.000Z	igor_	AlexC_	file -s /dev/sdb1
2006-12-14T10:57:00.000Z	AlexC_	igor_	/dev/sdb1: writable, no read permission  - what the hell?
2006-12-14T10:57:00.000Z	AlexC_	igor_	brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 17 2006-12-14 16:46 /dev/sdb1
2006-12-14T10:59:00.000Z	igor_	AlexC_	mount | grep windows shows something?
2006-12-14T11:00:00.000Z	AlexC_	igor_	nothing,
2006-12-14T11:02:00.000Z	AlexC_	igor_	!! Fixed! it was sdb5 not 1
2006-12-14T11:02:00.000Z	AlexC_	igor_	thank you _so_ much for your time and help, this has been driving me mad for a long time.
2006-12-14T11:03:00.000Z	AlexC_	igor_	yeah, that's what I thought it was. but I just looked at my device manage and saw sdb1 and sdb5 .. so I thought I'd try 5 and see if that worked
2006-12-14T11:04:00.000Z	igor_	AlexC_	ok. .best luck ... ;-) be welcome
