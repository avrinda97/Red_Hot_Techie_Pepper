2007-01-13T15:49:00.000Z	erg		brb
2007-01-13T15:51:00.000Z	erg		well the ubuntu-xgl chat is dead quiet
2007-01-13T15:52:00.000Z	erg		may I ask someone a couple of easy questions (I just cant find the answers in the man pages)
2007-01-13T15:53:00.000Z	erg		I guess no one is free then?
2007-01-13T15:53:00.000Z	roryy	erg	it's best just to ask
2007-01-13T15:54:00.000Z	erg		on here goes question #1: how do I start bitchx in gtk? (Ie use bitchx-gtk)
2007-01-13T15:54:00.000Z	roryy	erg	do you want a menu entry?
2007-01-13T15:55:00.000Z	erg	roryy	yes please
2007-01-13T15:55:00.000Z	roryy	erg	(this works in edgy) - right click on 'Applications', choose 'edit menus' from the menu
2007-01-13T15:56:00.000Z	roryy	erg	pick a menu (Applications -> Internet), click 'New Item', and add the entry (let me know if you need more help with this)
2007-01-13T15:56:00.000Z	erg	roryy	ok did that and I have edgy installed
2007-01-13T15:57:00.000Z	roryy	erg	perhaps I should have asked if you have installed bitchx-gtk ?
2007-01-13T15:57:00.000Z	erg	roryy	yes I have bitchx-gtk installed via apt-get
2007-01-13T15:58:00.000Z	erg	roryy	and what would be the command?
2007-01-13T15:58:00.000Z	roryy	erg	I would guess 'bitchx-gtk'
2007-01-13T15:58:00.000Z	roryy	erg	if that's not it, run 'dpkg -L bitchx-gtk|grep bin/' in a command window
2007-01-13T15:58:00.000Z	roryy	erg	you should get a list of possibilities
2007-01-13T15:58:00.000Z	erg	roryy	ty Ill do that
2007-01-13T16:01:00.000Z	erg	roryy	that worked thank you
