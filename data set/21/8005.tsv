2006-06-09T15:45:00.000Z	Tom^		hi, i'm having trouble starting X in dapper drake (botting as a live CD) - i can get Knoppix 3.8 to start x with no problems. is there a config file or something that i can copy from my live knoppix session that will have the correct settings for x in ubuntu?
2006-06-09T15:46:00.000Z	alkali	Tom^	what kind of card do you have?
2006-06-09T15:46:00.000Z	Tom^		Saphire x800 GTO
2006-06-09T15:47:00.000Z	alkali	Tom^	can you get to a command line with the cd?
2006-06-09T15:47:00.000Z	Tom^		i had a look for xorg.conf in /etc/X11/ but it's not there
2006-06-09T15:48:00.000Z	Tom^	alkali	- yes, i have cmd prompt
2006-06-09T15:48:00.000Z	alkali	Tom^	go with the command "dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" and the first will make you choose a driver.  Scroll down and select "vesa"
2006-06-09T15:50:00.000Z	Tom^	alkali	- I've tried manually editing xorg.conf and using vesa - my screens go to sleep and pc locks up when i try to startx
2006-06-09T15:50:00.000Z	alkali	Tom^	thats what my X800 did until I used the xserver-xorg command.  Manually didn't work for m
2006-06-09T15:50:00.000Z	alkali		*me
2006-06-09T15:50:00.000Z	Tom^		i was just hoping that i would somehow be able to grab the settings that knoppix uses and use them for ubuntu
2006-06-09T15:51:00.000Z	Tom^		ahh, k
2006-06-09T15:51:00.000Z	Tom^		thanks i'll give it a try
2006-06-09T15:51:00.000Z	alkali		no prob, best of luck hope it helps
2006-06-09T15:51:00.000Z	Tom^	alkali	- have you got it working with the fglrx driver? or only vesa?
2006-06-09T15:52:00.000Z	Tom^		either is ok for me at the moment, i just want to be able to start x ;)
2006-06-09T15:52:00.000Z	alkali	Tom^	thats why I'm in here, I've got a problem with my custom kernel headers and my fglrx install.  I need someone to look at the output
2006-06-09T15:52:00.000Z	alkali	Tom^	but it worked before
2006-06-09T15:53:00.000Z	Tom^		ahh, k
2006-06-09T15:54:00.000Z	alkali		anyone got time to look at my output from fglrx install? http://pastebin.com/769482 is where the error is.
2006-06-09T16:08:00.000Z	alkali	Tom^	did you get it working?
