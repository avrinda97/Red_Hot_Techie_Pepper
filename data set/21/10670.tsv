2005-02-21T06:05:00.000Z	shock_		damn... whats this about... absolutely no other wm except gnome and kde are currently not crshing my X?
2005-02-21T06:06:00.000Z	shock_		this is major pain!
2005-02-21T06:06:00.000Z	shock_		anyone a clue?
2005-02-21T06:06:00.000Z	shock_		powerpc here
2005-02-21T06:07:00.000Z	Stew2	shock_	What's wrong with gnome or kde?
2005-02-21T06:07:00.000Z	Stew2	shock_	you're trying to get something else running, some other wm?
2005-02-21T06:09:00.000Z	Stew2	shock_	Well, you want to run something that a lot of other people aren't, it seems like it's asking for extra trouble. Linux in general has enough trouble running out of the box on mainstream setups. It seems when it becomes tweaking it, far too easy to jump off the deep end (unless, you really know linux)
2005-02-21T06:09:00.000Z	Stew2	shock_	Good luck. I like powerpc.
2005-02-21T06:10:00.000Z	Stew2	shock_	You need to join #ubuntuexperts then. :)
2005-02-21T06:10:00.000Z	Stew2	shock_	There you will find all the upper end help.
2005-02-21T06:10:00.000Z	Stew2	shock_	It may be lonely and cold /action hands shock_ a jacket.
2005-02-21T06:11:00.000Z	Stew2	shock_	Yes. It's true.
2005-02-21T06:11:00.000Z	Stew2	shock_	That, is a personal problem. I say, have more than one.
2005-02-21T06:12:00.000Z	Stew2	shock_	As long as she's okay with it.
2005-02-21T06:12:00.000Z	Stew2	shock_	Then you get to avoid 'drama'.
