2008-12-19T19:55:00.000Z	Tyrath	fde	apt-get
2008-12-19T19:55:00.000Z	fde	Tyrath	why would he need to install apt-get?
2008-12-19T19:55:00.000Z	fde	Tyrath	what apt tool do you think you mean?
2008-12-19T19:55:00.000Z	Tyrath	fde	because it's not working properly
2008-12-19T19:55:00.000Z	Tyrath	fde	and he could apt-get install -f
2008-12-19T19:56:00.000Z	fde	Tyrath	how so? he's trying to dist-upgrade correct?
2008-12-19T19:56:00.000Z	fde	Tyrath	order doesn't matter... you probably shouldn't take him private though if you aren't sure on the commands etc
2008-12-19T19:56:00.000Z	Tyrath	fde	i never suggested that was a good idea
2008-12-19T19:58:00.000Z	fde	Tyrath	Because its not helpful to give false information... if you dont know the answer, don't comment, it just causes confusion.
2008-12-19T19:59:00.000Z	Tyrath	fde	false? please tell me what the harm is in reinstalling an application.... please!
2008-12-19T20:01:00.000Z	Tyrath	fde	i'm lucky if whenever i download an application it works straight the first time. usually i'm reinstalling, changing settings, doing all that to get them to work
2008-12-19T20:01:00.000Z	Tyrath	fde	and guess what... eventually they do
2008-12-25T06:57:00.000Z	Tyrath	fde	how do I synchronise with an iPod
2008-12-25T06:58:00.000Z	fde	Tyrath	you can't, you can only play off of the iPod
2008-12-25T06:58:00.000Z	Tyrath	fde	so I can't put files on the iPod using Rhythmbox?
2008-12-25T06:58:00.000Z	fde	Tyrath	pretty sure that's what I just said?
2008-12-25T06:59:00.000Z	Tyrath	fde	so if you had an iPod which application would you use?
2008-12-25T06:59:00.000Z	fde	Tyrath	try gtkpod
2008-12-25T06:59:00.000Z	Tyrath	fde	k thanks
2008-12-25T06:59:00.000Z	fde	Tyrath	I wouldn't purchase an iPod though, they're a rip off
2008-12-25T06:59:00.000Z	fde	Tyrath	no
