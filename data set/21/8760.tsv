2006-01-17T15:48:00.000Z	mitrovarr	_elessar	 That might be helpful, it talks about agp support in the nvidia drivers
2006-01-17T15:50:00.000Z	_elessar	mitrovarr	problem is that this is driver for nvidia grphics card...
2006-01-17T15:50:00.000Z	_elessar	mitrovarr	I'm in linux for some year, please do not say me a noob.... :)
2006-01-17T15:50:00.000Z	mitrovarr	_elessar	 Doh, I saw the nforce so I thought 'nvidia'
2006-01-17T15:51:00.000Z	_elessar	mitrovarr	here is the problem
2006-01-17T15:51:00.000Z	mitrovarr	_elessar	 but that's your motherboard, of course, not your video card...
2006-01-17T15:51:00.000Z	_elessar	mitrovarr	nforce drivers are for audio and net only, not for AGP
2006-01-17T15:52:00.000Z	_elessar	mitrovarr	that is not my board - me friends :)
2006-01-17T15:52:00.000Z	_elessar	mitrovarr	eh, I getting drunk :_P
2006-01-17T15:52:00.000Z	_elessar	mitrovarr	simply - I need driver AGP driver for ATG64
2006-01-17T15:53:00.000Z	mitrovarr	_elessar	 Are you sure you need drivers to make it work?  I mean, most people don't even have to install special drivers for their motherboards are all
2006-01-17T15:54:00.000Z	_elessar	mitrovarr	look
2006-01-17T15:55:00.000Z	_elessar	mitrovarr	I'm not a noob - I know how to reed /ver/log etc...
2006-01-17T15:56:00.000Z	mitrovarr	_elessar	 Sorry then, I only jumped in because I misread your message and thought you were working with nvidia stuff.  I don't know anything about ati hardware.
2006-01-17T15:56:00.000Z	_elessar	mitrovarr	NP
2006-01-17T15:57:00.000Z	_elessar	mitrovarr	I have nfiorce2 and nvidia card now, but my friend haves ATi with nfirce3 and I wat to install there Kubuntu
