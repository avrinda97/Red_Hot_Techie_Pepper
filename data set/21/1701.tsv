2011-11-25T13:31:00.000Z	Benkinooby		hi, i am invoking a script (using kupfer, an application launcher like gnome-do) wich opens an urxvt terminal and starts mplayer within that terminal. If I press ctrl+c to stop the player, the terminal also gets closed. i want: pressing ctrl+c stops the mplayer but leaves the terminal open. any hints/suggestions
2011-11-25T13:32:00.000Z	gmzlj	Benkinooby	patch urxvt
2011-11-25T13:32:00.000Z	gmzlj	Benkinooby	that's just how it works
2011-11-25T13:33:00.000Z	gmzlj	Benkinooby	or write a wrapper script and run that instead
2011-11-25T13:33:00.000Z	gmzlj	Benkinooby	something like: mplayer $@; exec $SHELL
2011-11-25T13:33:00.000Z	gmzlj		might do the trick
2011-11-25T13:34:00.000Z	Benkinooby	gmzlj	wrapper would be using the script to open a terminal, and let that terminal execute an other script?
2011-11-25T13:35:00.000Z	gmzlj	Benkinooby	have urxvt launch the wrapper script around mplayer rather than mplayer directly
2011-11-25T13:36:00.000Z	gmzlj	Benkinooby	something like this would do the trick: http://codepad.org/m48KBCi7
2011-11-25T13:38:00.000Z	Benkinooby	gmzlj	i do not understand that script... what's that $@ ?
2011-11-25T13:42:00.000Z	Benkinooby	gmzlj	also, your script starts the mplayer in the background, so i can not control it (adjusting volume and stuff)
2011-11-25T13:43:00.000Z	Benkinooby	gmzlj	thank you for your input and time
2011-11-25T13:43:00.000Z	gmzlj	Benkinooby	it shouldn't. but i never verified it worked either
2011-11-25T13:43:00.000Z	gmzlj		its just an idea
2011-11-25T13:43:00.000Z	Benkinooby	gmzlj	never mind... but could you explain me the $@ ?
2011-11-25T13:43:00.000Z	gmzlj	Benkinooby	all of ARGV
2011-11-25T13:44:00.000Z	Benkinooby	gmzlj	ah, so i would have to enter what i want to give to mplayer as options?
2011-11-25T13:44:00.000Z	gmzlj		yeah
2011-11-25T13:44:00.000Z	gmzlj		i can't remember if it needs to be quoted or not
2011-11-25T13:44:00.000Z	gmzlj		as i said, a starting place
2011-11-25T13:45:00.000Z	Benkinooby	gmzlj	thought so... was just testing it. no it works without quotes
