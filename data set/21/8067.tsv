2006-06-03T12:49:00.000Z	Jether4	Frogzoo	ok this is weird, telnet www.google.com says trying 1.0.0.0
2006-06-03T12:49:00.000Z	Jether4	Frogzoo	 so i ping google.com and its gets the ip
2006-06-03T12:49:00.000Z	Jether4	Frogzoo	 and then i telnet again and it gets the right ip and connets
2006-06-03T12:49:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Jether4	well 1.0.0.0 definitely isn't the right address
2006-06-03T12:50:00.000Z	Jether4	Frogzoo	but after i ping, it gets the right address and then connects, its as though i need to ping it to get the address and then i can connect
2006-06-03T12:53:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Jether4	ok, your router's not playing dice, for some reason - that 1.0.0.0 address is just wrong...what's the router make/model?
2006-06-03T12:53:00.000Z	Jether4	Frogzoo	ermm not sure, but its not a well known make, what do i need to cinfigure?
2006-06-03T12:54:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Jether4	dunno - I'm looking for a make/model to google against - other peeps will have had the same problem
2006-06-03T12:54:00.000Z	Jether4	Frogzoo	ok ermm well it says guru

2006-06-03T12:59:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Jether4	is the connection between the pc & router ethernet or usb?
2006-06-03T12:59:00.000Z	Jether4	Frogzoo	ethernet
2006-06-03T13:03:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Jether4	seems the safecom routers have 'issues' from what I read - only soln is upgrade the firmware
2006-06-03T13:03:00.000Z	Jether4	Frogzoo	oh, but the issues are only with linux? not windows?
2006-06-03T13:05:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Jether4	have you tried rebooting the router?
2006-06-03T13:05:00.000Z	Jether4	Frogzoo	no, i will do now, and ill reboot ubuntu just in case, be back in a few mins
