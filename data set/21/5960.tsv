2007-06-30T09:43:00.000Z	jimqode	xoRock	is your friend running windows?
2007-06-30T09:43:00.000Z	xoRock	jimqode	he run ubuntu 7.04 same as mine
2007-06-30T09:44:00.000Z	jimqode	xoRock	how are you trying to access the file? And what kind of error message do you get?
2007-06-30T09:46:00.000Z	xoRock	jimqode	i tried to copy,but it give me error invallid parameters while copying "smb://blabla
2007-06-30T09:47:00.000Z	xoRock	jimqode	but when the file is closed i'm able to copy
2007-06-30T09:47:00.000Z	jimqode	xoRock	do you have writing permission on that share? if so try to make a copy of the file on the same place, then get the copy.
2007-06-30T09:48:00.000Z	xoRock	jimqode	i cant copy it, open it, etc
2007-06-30T09:49:00.000Z	xoRock	jimqode	i have writing permission
2007-06-30T09:50:00.000Z	jimqode	xoRock	did you try to make a copy of the on the same share?
2007-06-30T09:52:00.000Z	xoRock	jimqode	yes, it says error invalid parameter bla bla while copying
2007-06-30T09:53:00.000Z	xoRock	jimqode	but i can move it into another folder
2007-06-30T09:53:00.000Z	xoRock	jimqode	 strange
2007-06-30T09:53:00.000Z	jimqode	xoRock	hmm sorry then. out of ideas.
2007-06-30T10:02:00.000Z	xoRock	jimqode	just curious, what is the point of file permission read only if i can copy the file to local folder and edit it from there?
2007-06-30T10:03:00.000Z	jimqode	xoRock	you can be sure nobody changes that file, they can only make a copy and edit it just as you said it :)
