2007-07-02T15:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ikon	Did sound ever work or is this a new problem?
2007-07-02T15:30:00.000Z	ikon	Jordan_U	what can i do?
2007-07-02T15:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ikon	What is the output of "asoundconf list" ?
2007-07-02T15:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ikon	try running: "alsamixer" use the arrow keys to change volume and switch channels
2007-07-02T15:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ikon	There are multiple sound outputs that you can change the volume of, use the right and left arrow keys to control different levels
2007-07-02T15:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ikon	Are all of the channels turned up?
2007-07-02T15:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ikon	Do all of them have a green 00 at the bottom?
2007-07-02T15:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ikon	That means that they are muted, press "m" to unmute them, then sound should work
2007-07-02T15:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ikon	I don't know then :(
2007-07-02T15:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ikon	Just to test, what happens when you run: "cat /dev/urandom | aplay" ?
2007-07-02T15:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ikon	Ok, as a test ( turn down your speakers, this may be very loud ) what happens when you run: "cat /dev/urandom > /dev/dsp" ?
2007-07-02T15:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ikon	I don't think that I can help you, sorry :(
2007-08-23T08:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ikon	Was it working before and stopped or has it never worked with Ubuntu?
2007-08-23T08:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ikon	what is the output of "asoundconf list" ?
