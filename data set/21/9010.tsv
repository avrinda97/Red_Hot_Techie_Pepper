2005-12-04T14:11:00.000Z	LjL	nubs0r	listen, 1) we're offtopic 2) why do you think only english counts 3) pronounce things the way you like and be happy
2005-12-04T14:11:00.000Z	nubs0r	LjL	what language is C++ in? mostly its English
2005-12-04T14:11:00.000Z	LjL	nubs0r	i really don't see why everyone should revolve around you just because you speak english
2005-12-04T14:11:00.000Z	nubs0r	LjL	man don't get so defensive.
2005-12-04T14:12:00.000Z	LjL	nubs0r	and i'm clrealy stating there's no reason why this should mean distributions (or whatever) should have english name. let people call their programs the way you like
2005-12-04T14:13:00.000Z	nubs0r	LjL	within certain limits, they should be easy to pronounce at least
2005-12-04T14:13:00.000Z	LjL	nubs0r	if i wrote a program and gave it an italian name, and you came to me complaining i should give it an english name, i would probably tell you to go to ugly places
2005-12-04T14:13:00.000Z	nubs0r	LjL	if you called it 2398572359hasdglk i wouldnt use it
2005-12-04T14:13:00.000Z	nubs0r	LjL	i want sane names..
