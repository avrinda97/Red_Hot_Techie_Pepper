2010-01-21T11:45:00.000Z	soreau	Threetimes	Which card model do you have?
2010-01-21T11:47:00.000Z	soreau	Threetimes	What version of ubuntu?
2010-01-21T11:47:00.000Z	soreau	Threetimes	How did you install the driver?
2010-01-21T11:48:00.000Z	soreau	Threetimes	Well you probably want to remove that by running the uninstall script in /usr/share/ati and install instead via sys>admin>hardware drivers
2010-01-21T11:49:00.000Z	soreau	Threetimes	Your other option is to install the latest open driver packages which will give you 3D acceleration
2010-01-21T11:50:00.000Z	Threetimes	soreau	is it suitable for day-to-day use already? Are we talking about radeonhd?
2010-01-21T11:50:00.000Z	soreau	Threetimes	No, you don't want radeonhd for the open driver. You want radeon
2010-01-21T11:52:00.000Z	soreau	Threetimes	rumpsy: 1) Look at the output of 'dpkg -l|grep fglrx' and remove any packages with 'ii' next to them 2) Run this to install latest open driver packages 'sudo apt-add-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade' 3) Rename, move or remove /etc/X1//xorg.conf 4) Reboot.
2010-02-21T19:13:00.000Z	soreau	Threetimes	Yes, the open driver has 3D for that card now
2010-02-21T20:49:00.000Z	soreau	Threetimes	How did you install fglrx?
2010-02-21T20:50:00.000Z	Threetimes	soreau	with --buildpkg Ubuntu/jautny
2010-02-21T20:51:00.000Z	soreau	Threetimes	Why did you not use the hardware drivers manager designed for installing fglrx correctly?
2010-02-21T20:51:00.000Z	Threetimes	soreau	I want tu use a recent version, for better dual-head support.
2010-02-21T20:52:00.000Z	soreau	Threetimes	Why would you think that a newer version has better dual head support?
2010-02-21T20:52:00.000Z	soreau	Threetimes	fglrx has sucked for years. If you get it working any other way than jockey (sys>admin>hardware drivers) you are fortunate. Otherwise, you're on your own
2010-02-21T20:53:00.000Z	Threetimes	soreau	Because it does. I can use my dvd player as a second monitor right now, but I couldn't with 9.8 or 9.6
2010-02-21T20:53:00.000Z	soreau	Threetimes	Well your driver installation is broken. I recommend you uninstall the driver (hint: look for an uninstall script in /usr/share/ati) and reinstall the drivers the correct way using the hardware driver manager
2010-02-21T20:54:00.000Z	soreau	Threetimes	You other option is to remove all versions of fglrx and use the open driver by installing packages from the xorg-edgers repo and using a latest kernel from ppa
2010-02-21T20:54:00.000Z	Threetimes	soreau	do they have 3D for HD2600XT?
2010-02-21T20:56:00.000Z	soreau	Threetimes	Yes, I told you that like 3 hours ago
