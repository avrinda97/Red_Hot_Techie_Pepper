2009-11-02T06:27:00.000Z	veggteppe		Hi there. Having some issues hosting a game on my local area net.  They can find me, but they can't connect to me. so im suspecting a firewall issue. doing some googling but cant find the correct answer. Anyone?
2009-11-02T06:28:00.000Z	Wolfcastle	veggteppe	disable your firewall and try it out to confirm your suspicion
2009-11-02T06:30:00.000Z	Wolfcastle	veggteppe	paste "sudo iptables -L"

2009-11-02T06:32:00.000Z	Wolfcastle	veggteppe	iptables is not blocking anything
2009-11-02T06:32:00.000Z	veggteppe	Wolfcastle	Any ideas on whats wrong then ?:P xD
2009-11-02T06:32:00.000Z	Wolfcastle	veggteppe	hehe kind of hard to tell
2009-11-02T06:33:00.000Z	veggteppe	Wolfcastle	hehe, indeed. I just remember that i had a furmiliar problem on windows, and there it was the firewall :P
2009-11-02T06:34:00.000Z	Wolfcastle	veggteppe	have you tried ping, or maybe ssh or something to confirm that it's the game and not something else?
2009-11-02T06:35:00.000Z	veggteppe	Wolfcastle	nope i havent. Abit of a newbie to ubuntu atm, so no idea howto xD
2009-11-02T06:36:00.000Z	veggteppe	Wolfcastle	Attempted a ping, time=0.087ms :P
2009-11-02T06:36:00.000Z	Wolfcastle	veggteppe	a ping is as simple as it gets, try "ping -c 4 yourip" from a client
2009-11-02T06:36:00.000Z	Wolfcastle	veggteppe	ok then it should be something specific to the game
2009-11-02T06:36:00.000Z	Wolfcastle	veggteppe	what game is it btw?
2009-11-02T06:36:00.000Z	veggteppe	Wolfcastle	Wc3:P running on cedega

2009-11-02T06:38:00.000Z	veggteppe	Wolfcastle	Can it be that i have to forward something for cedega aswell? hmm
