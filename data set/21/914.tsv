2011-04-18T03:30:00.000Z	edbian	Knuxgen	I think the CD is bad
2011-04-18T03:30:00.000Z	edbian	Knuxgen	It said it couldn't find a filesystem (which it should be able to read from the CD)
2011-04-18T04:00:00.000Z	edbian	Knuxgen	what is virtual clone drive?
2011-04-18T04:01:00.000Z	Knuxgen	edbian	used to mount a virtual drive
2011-04-18T04:01:00.000Z	edbian	Knuxgen	What is a virtual drive?  (your harddrives and jump drives are physical)
2011-04-18T04:02:00.000Z	Knuxgen	edbian	it makes a virtual cd/dvd rom and mounts an iso file so you dont have to burn it
2011-04-18T04:02:00.000Z	edbian	Knuxgen	this is not wubi.  (unless you start wubi) I don't think you'll be able to install Ubuntu because you won't be able to partition
2011-04-18T04:03:00.000Z	Knuxgen	edbian	i've made two partitions before to be ready for ubuntu
2011-04-18T04:03:00.000Z	edbian	Knuxgen	Why can't you?
2011-04-18T04:03:00.000Z	Knuxgen	edbian	however i burn it, it gives me the screen i posted

2011-04-18T04:04:00.000Z	edbian	Knuxgen	Didn't we do this a while ago?
2011-04-18T04:05:00.000Z	Knuxgen	edbian	we did, i burned again, md5sum is correct, dont know what else might be wrong
2011-04-18T04:06:00.000Z	edbian	Knuxgen	mmm.  try the other CD drive?
2011-04-18T04:09:00.000Z	Knuxgen	edbian	dont have any other :) i'll try to go with UNetbootin and we will see

2011-04-18T04:09:00.000Z	edbian	Knuxgen	good luck!
2011-04-18T04:10:00.000Z	edbian	Knuxgen	I'm guessing you have a sata CD drive and Ubuntu is getting confused with your sata HDD and your sata CD drive
