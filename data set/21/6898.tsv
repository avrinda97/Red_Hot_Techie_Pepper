2008-03-30T10:56:00.000Z	elpargo		correct Dr_willis, it's closer to BSD in it's naming.
2008-03-30T10:56:00.000Z	Dr_willis	elpargo	 bingo! :)
2008-03-30T10:57:00.000Z	elpargo	Dr_willis	it's the connection ..... what zcat[1] said.
2008-04-18T05:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	elpargo	 when transfering text files from windows to linux. often there can be CarrageReturn/LineFeed issues.
2008-04-18T05:48:00.000Z	elpargo	Dr_willis	yea that will cause full lines with no linebreak, this is an encoding issue.
2008-04-18T05:49:00.000Z	Dr_willis	elpargo	 yep. theres converter tools that can fix it. in my case the First like #!/bin/perl had a CR/LF at the end.. thta made the whole script break. :) took me forger to figure it out
2008-04-18T05:50:00.000Z	elpargo	Dr_willis	LFCR won't change a text file to be recognized as binary.
2008-04-18T05:51:00.000Z	Dr_willis	elpargo	 load it into an editor and see then. :) i havent been paying attention to the convo.
2008-04-18T05:51:00.000Z	elpargo	Dr_willis	as for the converter sure vim.
2008-04-18T05:51:00.000Z	elpargo	Dr_willis	all binary except if I open it up on vim.
2008-04-18T05:51:00.000Z	Dr_willis	elpargo	 whats telling you it is binary anyway?
2008-04-18T05:52:00.000Z	elpargo	Dr_willis	file, and every crappy text editor. and/or tool.
2008-04-18T05:53:00.000Z	Dr_willis	elpargo	 you sure its not been made executable?   Im missing the core problem.. if its an ascii file.. do whatever ya want to it and be done with it.. :)
2008-04-18T05:54:00.000Z	elpargo	Dr_willis	yea I'm opening it up and all I get is garbage.
2008-04-18T05:55:00.000Z	Dr_willis	elpargo	 thats.. weird.
2008-04-18T05:56:00.000Z	Dr_willis	elpargo	 i wonder if its like the first line thats some nonprinting char thats confusing things.
2008-04-18T05:57:00.000Z	Dr_willis	elpargo	 ive used fte befor - it can show non-printing chars , its helped me track down odd things like this befor
2008-04-18T05:57:00.000Z	elpargo	Dr_willis	fte? or was that a typo?
2008-04-18T05:59:00.000Z	elpargo	Dr_willis	that's showing yet a different output :P
2008-05-14T16:42:00.000Z	Dr_willis	elpargo	 i recall someone else in here the other day with  firebug issues.
2008-05-14T16:43:00.000Z	elpargo	Dr_willis	yes they broke it with the include of the FF3 beta.
