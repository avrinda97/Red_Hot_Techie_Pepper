2007-03-27T16:52:00.000Z	neozen	big_	punch the make and model of the laptop into ubuntuforums.org's search function
2007-03-27T16:53:00.000Z	neozen	big_	yeah.... that's where you'll find nearly every solution that someone more knowledgeable (or more free time) then you has come up with
2007-03-27T16:55:00.000Z	neozen	big_	alrighty... let me look it up for you

2007-03-27T16:59:00.000Z	neozen	big_	you should be able to just click on the graphical network manager (little thing in your tray that looks like a mouse) ... and select which access point you want to use
2007-03-27T16:59:00.000Z	neozen	big_	yeah.. you'll be all set...

2007-03-27T05:00:00.000Z	neozen	big_	and I didn't have to do anything to get it to work other then install network-manager-gnome
2007-03-27T05:00:00.000Z	neozen	big_	(doesn't come installed on xubuntu by default)
2007-03-27T05:01:00.000Z	neozen	big_	::nods:: you'll have it easier then many
