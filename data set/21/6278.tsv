2008-08-28T09:26:00.000Z	Gnea	bofh80	what is NETOP?
2008-08-28T09:27:00.000Z	bofh80	Gnea	netop remote control.  if you can find it, look up danware, a reseller
2008-08-28T09:28:00.000Z	Gnea	bofh80	oh, it's not open source?
2008-08-28T09:29:00.000Z	bofh80	Gnea	no, there is a linux version, unfortunately there are hardly any multy platform, "remote control" programs. that are decent. this is the 'fastest' remote control on earth
2008-08-28T09:30:00.000Z	bofh80	Gnea	barely any of the decent ones are free unfortunaltey, that's why people shout about vnc - ugh.
2008-08-28T09:30:00.000Z	Gnea	bofh80	claiming that it's the fastest out of anything else, seems a bit too bold... thanks, but no thanks.
2008-08-28T09:31:00.000Z	bofh80	Gnea	it's from experience, and i mean experience, i've tested everything out of the box, and i mean everything. this thing works like local over dial up speeds. incredulous
2008-08-28T09:32:00.000Z	Gnea	bofh80	yes, well, i can see you're very enthused about it. perhaps you could be so kind as to redirect that enthusiasm toward solving some more important problems. :)
2008-08-28T09:33:00.000Z	bofh80	Gnea	well you asked. when you say enthused, i hardly breathed a word till you asked.
2008-08-28T09:59:00.000Z	Gnea	bofh80	enough.
2008-08-29T01:39:00.000Z	Gnea	bofh80	nope, seen it do it.
2008-08-29T01:40:00.000Z	bofh80	Gnea	Flannel - nasty
2008-08-29T01:47:00.000Z	Gnea	bofh80	that method is discouraged in ubuntu.
2008-10-07T20:19:00.000Z	Gnea	bofh80	if the package is broken, then fix it
2008-10-07T20:20:00.000Z	bofh80	Gnea	if a package is broken don't purport that it works
2008-10-07T20:20:00.000Z	Gnea	bofh80	works fine here, you must've done something wrong.
2008-10-07T20:21:00.000Z	Gnea	bofh80	and I am going to state here, that you're doing it wrong.
2008-10-07T20:21:00.000Z	bofh80	Gnea	and if you install flash from the adobe site you might find yours starts to work proerplyu
2008-10-07T20:22:00.000Z	Gnea	bofh80	but I don't have to. mine works just fine. perhaps you've got a buggy video driver. you should really file a bug report and get as much detail crammed into it that you can.
2008-10-07T20:23:00.000Z	bofh80	Gnea	i have no need to, as i've said i've installed ubuntu on over 50 different machines for home use, can you claim the same? i've TESTED have you?
2008-10-07T20:23:00.000Z	Gnea	bofh80	yes, I have.
