2012-05-25T16:10:00.000Z	manixrock		hey, I'm trying to make a linux image using buildroot-2012.05 (latest version right now), but when I run "make busybox-menuconfig" I get "No rule to make target"
2012-05-25T16:11:00.000Z	manixrock		more specifically I get: make: *** No rule to make target `busybox-menuconfig'.  Stop.
2012-05-25T16:11:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	manixrock	When executing this command what's your present working directory? Have you tried running './configure'?
2012-05-25T16:12:00.000Z	manixrock	DeltaHeavy	I get: bash: ./configure: No such file or directory
2012-05-25T16:12:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	manixrock	What's your present working directory when executing those commands.
2012-05-25T16:12:00.000Z	manixrock	DeltaHeavy	the current directory is the buildroot folder
2012-05-25T16:13:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	manixrock	What's the output of 'pwd'
2012-05-25T16:13:00.000Z	manixrock	DeltaHeavy	/home/myusername/Downloads/buildroot-2012.02
2012-05-25T16:14:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	manixrock	Can you pastebin the output of 'ls -la'
2012-05-25T16:15:00.000Z	manixrock	DeltaHeavy	here - http://pastebin.com/BYpiZ5vX
2012-05-25T16:17:00.000Z	manixrock	DeltaHeavy	I downloaded those files as an archive from here: http://buildroot.uclibc.org/download.html
2012-05-25T16:17:00.000Z	manixrock	DeltaHeavy	the link "buildroot-2012.02.tar.gz "
2012-05-25T16:18:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	manixrock	Try './Config.in' './Makefile' and if that doesn't work pastebin 'ls -la configs' or just mess around in there. If there's no target you probably need to run some sort of shell script in here
2012-05-25T16:19:00.000Z	manixrock	DeltaHeavy	the tutorial on this page - http://buildroot.uclibc.org/buildroot.html#custom_busybox - says to run "make busybox-menuconfig"
2012-05-25T16:20:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	manixrock	And it's saying there's no target? Try going into the root directory of the source files (the folder the .tar.gz gave you) and just run 'make'.
2012-05-25T16:20:00.000Z	manixrock	DeltaHeavy	when I run "sudo ./Config.in" I get: "sudo: ./Config.in: command not found"
2012-05-25T16:21:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	manixrock	If you're going to use sudo don't include the './'
2012-05-25T16:22:00.000Z	manixrock	DeltaHeavy	when I run "sudo Config.in" I get: "sudo: Config.in: command not found"
2012-05-25T16:24:00.000Z	manixrock	DeltaHeavy	running "make" in the buildroot directory throws these errors - http://pastebin.com/09pg1JTR
2012-05-25T16:25:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	manixrock	Ok now we're getting somewhere. Run 'sudo apt-get install ncurses-devel'
2012-05-25T16:27:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	manixrock	Do you just want this installed or do you want to compile it from source?
