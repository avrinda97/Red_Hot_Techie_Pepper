2005-04-20T16:13:00.000Z	candyban		Hi guys
2005-04-20T16:13:00.000Z	candyban		Is there an "easy" upgrade path from debian (sid) to ubuntu?
2005-04-20T16:13:00.000Z	candyban		like just changing my sources
2005-04-20T16:13:00.000Z	thoreauputic	candyban	no, not easy or recommended
2005-04-20T16:41:00.000Z	thoreauputic	candyban	KDE is pretty dumb if it can't run a bash script without an sh suffix
2005-04-20T16:41:00.000Z	candyban	thoreauputic	depends ... if you told it to behave that way ... then it's not "stupid"
2005-04-20T16:41:00.000Z	thoreauputic	candyban	true
2005-04-20T16:44:00.000Z	thoreauputic	candyban	nautilus gets around thet by asking if you want to execute or read
2005-04-20T16:52:00.000Z	thoreauputic	candyban	thanks :)
2005-08-23T09:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	candyban	heheh - it isn't trivial...
2005-08-23T09:37:00.000Z	candyban	thoreauputic	It used to work perfectly on Mandrake 7.1 (with my AWE64) back in the days ... just run sndconfig and everything worked like a charm
2005-08-23T09:38:00.000Z	thoreauputic	candyban	yeah - I have a crappy onboard sound card here ;)
2005-08-23T09:38:00.000Z	thoreauputic	candyban	getting midi to work on my card was ... interesting
2005-08-23T09:38:00.000Z	candyban	thoreauputic	I have that too ... but I thought (hoped/expected?) to have my SB Live working properly
2005-08-23T09:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	candyban	I agree - ubuntu's midi support is lacking IMO
2005-08-23T09:44:00.000Z	candyban	thoreauputic	doesn't matter if it's 1999 or 1990 ... It used to work and now it doesn't anymore ... I thought Linux was progressing ...
2005-08-23T09:45:00.000Z	thoreauputic	candyban	hrm - that was intended as sarcasm....
2005-08-23T09:51:00.000Z	thoreauputic	candyban	run timidity in server mode << final hint before I fall asleep
2005-08-23T09:53:00.000Z	candyban	thoreauputic	I want it to play on /dev/sequencer ... not /dev/pcm ... kmid (karaoke) and all other applications use /dev/sequencer
2005-08-23T09:54:00.000Z	thoreauputic	candyban	all I know is tht running timidity as a server enables kmid to connect on port 128
2005-08-23T09:55:00.000Z	thoreauputic	candyban	the options are in man timidity - now i really have to sleep: good luck
