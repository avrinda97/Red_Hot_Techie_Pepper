2005-09-29T05:25:00.000Z	bimberi	cyphase	is your irc client going "bing" a lot today? :)
2005-09-29T05:26:00.000Z	cyphase	bimberi	i don't have a sound for it, but the channel button keeps turning blue :)
2005-09-29T05:26:00.000Z	bimberi	cyphase	:)
2005-09-29T06:14:00.000Z	bimberi	cyphase	stopped at "izmM160-ankM160.ttnet.net.tr (195.175.7.10)"
2005-12-10T06:23:00.000Z	bimberi	cyphase	good question.  so they can nag the sysadmin i guess :P
2006-01-11T17:56:00.000Z	bimberi	cyphase	tar xvzf file.tar.gz
2006-01-11T17:57:00.000Z	bimberi	cyphase	np :)
2006-06-13T08:53:00.000Z	bimberi	cyphase	an itch to scratch :)
2006-06-13T08:54:00.000Z	cyphase	bimberi	not so much an itch..
2007-05-17T06:45:00.000Z	bimberi	cyphase	you could try using dd in two passes, one for each part of the file, avoiding the EOF character
2007-05-17T06:46:00.000Z	cyphase	bimberi	can you give me the command? i need this really quick
2007-05-17T06:46:00.000Z	cyphase	bimberi	it picked a terrible time to get screwed up
2007-05-17T06:46:00.000Z	bimberi	cyphase	sorry no, in essence i'm guessing, 'man dd' will be helpful
2007-05-17T06:46:00.000Z	cyphase	bimberi	ok, thanx anyway
2007-05-17T06:51:00.000Z	bimberi	cyphase	you could probably just 'cat badfile > anotherfile' for the first part, then something like 'dd if=badfile bs=1 skip=9999 >> anotherfile' for the 2nd part (where 9999 is the number of the byte _after_ the errant EOF byte)
2007-05-17T06:52:00.000Z	cyphase	bimberi	byte of the file, or byte of the hard drive?
2007-05-17T07:03:00.000Z	bimberi	cyphase	(sorry i stepped away) byte of the file.  It all swings on whether will interpret the EOF when it does the skipping.  Hopefully it won't
