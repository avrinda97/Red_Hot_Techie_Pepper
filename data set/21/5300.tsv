2007-11-16T04:03:00.000Z	kyled185	domor21	if it's already booted you don't have to reboot.  The computer needs to be at the login screen.  You won't see the login screen though since the monitor isn't working
2007-11-16T04:03:00.000Z	domor21	kyled185	im in xp now
2007-11-16T04:03:00.000Z	domor21	kyled185	so restart and do that
2007-11-16T04:04:00.000Z	kyled185	domor21	ok yeah you'll have to reboot, then once it's reached the point where you think it should be all the way up to let you log in, then press ctrl+alt+backspace
