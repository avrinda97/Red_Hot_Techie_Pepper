2007-07-17T12:30:00.000Z	Confuse-a-cat		Hello, I need help on an Ubuntu installation that continually crashes on bootup, both in regular installation mode and in safe mode. Can anyone help?
2007-07-17T12:31:00.000Z	zanaga	Confuse-a-cat	what kind of an error is displayed when it crashes?
2007-07-17T12:33:00.000Z	Confuse-a-cat	zanaga	occasionally I get a kernel panic, but it's been quite varied. Rarely I'm able to get to a desktop screen and attempt an installation, but it always crashes out. It sounds like a hardware issue, but I can't imagine what could be causing it.
2007-07-17T12:33:00.000Z	zanaga	Confuse-a-cat	have you tried running the memory tester from the installation CD?
2007-07-17T12:33:00.000Z	zanaga	Confuse-a-cat	it could be a memory issue
2007-07-17T12:34:00.000Z	Confuse-a-cat	zanaga	yes, I thought so as well, but the memory test all checked out.
2007-07-17T12:34:00.000Z	zanaga	Confuse-a-cat	odd. Which distribution version?
2007-07-17T12:34:00.000Z	Confuse-a-cat	zanaga	7.04
2007-07-17T12:35:00.000Z	zanaga	Confuse-a-cat	do you have a Wireless NIC?
2007-07-17T12:35:00.000Z	Confuse-a-cat	zanaga	no, just the ethernet that came with the Mboard
2007-07-17T12:35:00.000Z	zanaga	Confuse-a-cat	too bad, there was an issue in the broadcom driver that caused something similar
2007-07-17T12:36:00.000Z	Confuse-a-cat	zanaga	ahh, I wish it were something with an easy explanation
2007-07-17T12:36:00.000Z	zanaga	Confuse-a-cat	you could try an older version just to see if the problem is just in 7.04
2007-07-17T12:36:00.000Z	Confuse-a-cat	zanaga	Thanks, I will give that a try
2007-07-17T12:38:00.000Z	Confuse-a-cat	zanaga	I think this might be a little telling... this computer has gone through a few moves overseas, and after trying to install XP recently I discovered sound drivers would install, but no sound would be produced.
2007-07-17T12:39:00.000Z	Confuse-a-cat	zanaga	I'm suspecting there could be some real quirky hardware issues
2007-07-17T12:39:00.000Z	zanaga	Confuse-a-cat	it could be a motherboard issue then. Usually when i've run in to motherboard issues it's more like on/off type of thing
2007-07-17T12:39:00.000Z	zanaga	Confuse-a-cat	the only way to find out for sure is to start switching parts, and that's no fun
2007-07-17T12:40:00.000Z	Confuse-a-cat	zanaga	 Yeah... I've been messing with this thing for a few days already and am about ready to start again from scratch.
2007-07-17T12:40:00.000Z	Confuse-a-cat	zanaga	I'll give Edgy another try and see what happens. Thanks again for your help!
2007-07-17T12:41:00.000Z	zanaga	Confuse-a-cat	no problem, i hope you get the computer up and running
