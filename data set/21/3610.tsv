2009-11-01T23:25:00.000Z	natschil		Hello. Upgrading ubuntu completely messed up my system. I have a separate home partiton though with all my data, but it's encrypted :( how can I get the data off from a live cd?
2009-11-01T23:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	natschil	oh dear
2009-11-01T23:27:00.000Z	natschil	sebsebseb	yes. and I can't boot into the old ubuntu as my grub is completely broken, and something went wrong with the upgrade too. It's rather depressing :(. Is there a way I can get my data back?
2009-11-01T23:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	natschil	yeah it seems quite a lot of people haev had issues upgrading 9.04 to 9.10, well 9.10 should be clean installed really anyway,  because of  default Ext4 for clean installs and Grub 2
2009-11-01T23:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	natschil	maybe the 9.04 Live CD or something  and then  gain access to your partition?
2009-11-01T23:29:00.000Z	natschil	sebsebseb	I had ext4 on jaunty and it worked fine though... It would really suck if I lost all my data though, as I don't really have any backups.
2009-11-01T23:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	natschil	or the 9.10 Live CD even yes the desktop one
2009-11-01T23:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	natschil	yeah Ext4 in 9.04 is nice,  it's just not perfectly stable
2009-11-01T23:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	natschil	since the kernel they have and that
2009-11-01T23:29:00.000Z	natschil	sebsebseb	 I can acesss the partition from the livecd fine, but my home directory is encrypted with eCryptfs
2009-11-01T23:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	natschil	you need to access it the normal Ubuntu way I think,  but then again I haven't  done encrypted partitions
2009-11-01T23:31:00.000Z	natschil	sebsebseb	what do you mean normal ubuntu way? bbiab.
2009-11-01T23:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	natschil	However you access  them normalley using Ubuntu
2009-11-01T23:42:00.000Z	natschil	sebsebseb	well, normally the encrypted partitions are mounted automatically by ubuntu when I log in.
2009-11-01T23:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	natschil	Maybe they will be on a clean install of 9.10
2009-11-01T23:44:00.000Z	natschil	sebsebseb	I think you haven't quite understood my problem: When installing 9.04 from the alternate cd, there was an option like "encrypt my home directory", which I enabled. Now I need to get to this encrypted data to make a backup after which I can then upgrade ubuntu.
2009-11-01T23:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	natschil	I know about the option on the CD,  I  have never used it though,  so  my attempted help might not be good enough.   I guess the key has to be some where, and if you removed it,  your buggered
2009-11-01T23:47:00.000Z	natschil	sebsebseb	no, I didn't remove it.
2009-11-01T23:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	natschil	what list are you on about then?
2009-11-01T23:48:00.000Z	natschil	sebsebseb	What I'm asking is how I can mount an ecryptfs encrypted home directory.
2009-11-04T22:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	natschil	A clean install or upgrade?
