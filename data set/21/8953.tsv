2005-12-10T16:51:00.000Z	gi2k15		Ubuntu isn't able here to automount udf CDs. Any ideas to resolve it?
2005-12-10T16:53:00.000Z	soundray	gi2k15	mount it with a terminal command?
2005-12-10T16:54:00.000Z	gi2k15	soundray	I did it and worked, but then I wasn't able to umount it because it said the device was busy, all the time.
2005-12-10T16:55:00.000Z	soundray	gi2k15	you need to cd away from any directory on the disk before you can umount. Also close all open files on the CD.
2005-12-10T16:55:00.000Z	gi2k15	soundray	I did it, but still got this problem
2005-12-10T16:57:00.000Z	soundray	gi2k15	I get this, sometimes it's just impossible to find the process that prevents umounting. I don't think it's a udf fault.
2005-12-10T16:58:00.000Z	gi2k15	soundray	I don't know. The ISO cds mounts ok, but only when it comes to udf I got this problem
2005-12-10T16:58:00.000Z	soundray	gi2k15	well, I may be wrong. Does umount -f work?
2005-12-10T16:59:00.000Z	gi2k15	soundray	never tried it.
2005-12-10T16:59:00.000Z	soundray	gi2k15	last time I tried it didn't work anyway.
2005-12-10T16:59:00.000Z	gi2k15	soundray	I'll check it now
2005-12-11T17:00:00.000Z	gi2k15	soundray	now I was able to umount, without -f
2005-12-11T17:00:00.000Z	gi2k15	soundray	but automount still doesn't work
2005-12-11T17:01:00.000Z	soundray	gi2k15	are you using a mountpoint under /media ?
2005-12-11T17:01:00.000Z	gi2k15	soundray	yes
2005-12-11T17:01:00.000Z	gi2k15	soundray	/media/cdrom0
2005-12-11T17:02:00.000Z	soundray	gi2k15	maybe mkdir /mnt/udfcd and mount the cd there.
2005-12-11T17:02:00.000Z	soundray	gi2k15	maybe it's nautilus touching the media mountdir.
2005-12-11T17:03:00.000Z	gi2k15	soundray	but I could umount the CD now. I just can't automount. But anyway, I'll try to change the mount point to avoid more problems
2005-12-11T17:04:00.000Z	soundray	gi2k15	well, my suggestion was as a workaround to the umount problem. It cuts out automounting altogether.
2005-12-11T17:04:00.000Z	gi2k15	soundray	yes, yes. At least now I can umount the CD. Thanks for your help o/
