2006-06-27T13:56:00.000Z	Seattle_Mike		Dapper Ubuntu, Kubuntu - I can not get nfs (client and server) working.  Is it possible or should I go back to Breezy where it works fine?
2006-06-27T13:57:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	Seattle_Mike	Are you mounting with -o nolock (otherwise it will take ages)
2006-06-27T13:59:00.000Z	Seattle_Mike	h3sp4wn	... Good point I'll try that but after a long time it times out with Portmap not responding.
2006-06-27T14:00:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	Seattle_Mike	If you don't use nolock you need portmap on both ends I think (But I don't remember)
2006-06-27T14:01:00.000Z	Seattle_Mike	h3sp4wn	.. Yeah I've got portmap running ... I have a small home network and portmap runs on all.
2006-06-27T14:02:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	Seattle_Mike	I just always use nolock these days if I have to use nfs but I prefer shfs most of the time
2006-06-27T14:02:00.000Z	Seattle_Mike	h3sp4wn	OK my problem client  can mount no problem but I can't mount to it (i.e. it doesn't serve)
2006-06-27T14:03:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	Seattle_Mike	I don't understand what you mean
2006-06-27T14:04:00.000Z	Seattle_Mike	h3sp4wn	-shfs .... OK you got me with shfs ... I never heard of it.  Repeat of my problem follows
2006-06-27T14:04:00.000Z	Seattle_Mike	h3sp4wn	On one machine it can mount nfs no problem as a client, but it can't serve to other machines. OK?
2006-06-27T14:05:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	Seattle_Mike	And you has set /etc/exports the same as before yes ?
2006-06-27T14:06:00.000Z	Seattle_Mike	h3sp4wn	Yes etc/exports was the same as Breezy  ... this boc was an upgrade from Breezy to Dapper.
2006-06-27T14:08:00.000Z	Seattle_Mike	h3sp4wn	However: Dapper Install - same problem, can mount to server box but can't server itself.
2006-06-27T14:09:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	Seattle_Mike	You are trying to mount localhost over nfs ?
2006-06-27T14:10:00.000Z	Seattle_Mike	h3sp4wn	I use a mount 191.168.0.101:/ /media/server   ... not localhost is it?
2006-06-27T14:11:00.000Z	Seattle_Mike	h3sp4wn	I'll try shfs but in the past ssh locally on the network was too slow - nfs speed is AOK.
2006-06-27T14:40:00.000Z	Seattle_Mike	h3sp4wn	I can't use shfs - module is not in 2.6.15-23-386 .. thanks for your help.
2006-06-27T14:41:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	Seattle_Mike	You can build it with module assistant
2006-06-27T14:55:00.000Z	Seattle_Mike	h3sp4wn	- I give up.  Where is moduleassistant?  I have modle-init-tools installed but no ma
2006-06-27T14:57:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	Seattle_Mike	/usr/bin/module-assistant (once its installed) sudo apt-get install modules-assistant (you probably also want shfs-utils and shfs-source)
2006-06-28T16:27:00.000Z	Seattle_Mike	h3sp4wn	I installed shfs and it works fine ... if the speed is OK I will switch to it all the way.  Thanks a lot for your help.
