2006-05-01T05:06:00.000Z	dylonium		when i boot, it immidiately gets a gruub error
2006-05-01T05:06:00.000Z	dylonium		hold on one sec
2006-05-01T05:06:00.000Z	kingspawn	dylonium	have you still got the original partition?
2006-05-01T05:07:00.000Z	kingspawn	dylonium	windows, that is
2006-05-01T05:09:00.000Z	kingspawn	dylonium	you can boot the windows cd and use fixmbr utility in rescue mode, if you just need to get back your windows mbr
2006-05-01T05:18:00.000Z	kingspawn	dylonium	filename is just the filename of the mbr you said you had saved
2006-05-01T05:20:00.000Z	kingspawn	dylonium	did you specifically do "dd if=/dev/hda of=file bs=512 count=1" at one time?
2006-05-01T05:20:00.000Z	kingspawn	dylonium	what did you call the file?
2006-05-01T05:21:00.000Z	kingspawn	dylonium	grub cant override this one, if youve got it
2006-05-01T05:21:00.000Z	kingspawn	dylonium	where did you save it? thats the question.
2006-05-01T05:22:00.000Z	kingspawn	dylonium	you put the mbr on your external hd?
2006-05-01T05:38:00.000Z	kingspawn	dylonium	I am telling you, this really does depend on where you saved that file
2006-05-01T05:39:00.000Z	kingspawn	dylonium	there is no default place. the MBR is 512 bytes at the beginning of your disk telling grub/windows where to boot
2006-05-01T05:40:00.000Z	kingspawn	dylonium	not "fix mbr" but "fixmbr"
