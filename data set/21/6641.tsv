2007-11-02T19:36:00.000Z	RoyK		one more question - after installing the 3d stuff - how can I view the cube and rotate it and so on? i can't find that
2007-11-02T19:37:00.000Z	h1st0	RoyK	install compizconfig-settings-manager package
2007-11-02T19:37:00.000Z	RoyK	h1st0	I did, but what am I to turn on to get that? or what keys to press?
2007-11-02T19:38:00.000Z	h1st0	RoyK	well you can type ccsm in a terminal or hit alt+f2 to bring up a run prompt and type in ccsm.
2007-11-02T19:39:00.000Z	RoyK	h1st0	well, I'm looking around in there of course, but I just wondered how I actually trigger the cube view
2007-11-02T19:39:00.000Z	h1st0	RoyK	enable teh cube plugin and change teh hsize in general settings
2007-11-02T19:42:00.000Z	RoyK	h1st0	erm. hsize - where?
2007-11-02T19:42:00.000Z	h1st0	RoyK	horizontal size
2007-11-02T19:42:00.000Z	h1st0	RoyK	or something like that
2007-11-02T19:42:00.000Z	RoyK	h1st0	yes, but where can I change it?
2007-11-02T19:43:00.000Z	h1st0	RoyK	under general options in ccsm
2007-11-02T19:43:00.000Z	h1st0	RoyK	General Options > Desktop Size change horizontal virutal size to 4 and the other two values to 1
2007-11-02T19:44:00.000Z	h1st0	RoyK	then make sure cube plugin is check boxed and you should be good to go.
2007-11-02T19:59:00.000Z	RoyK	h1st0	_
2007-11-02T19:59:00.000Z	h1st0	RoyK	you can hold ctrl+alt and click and drag the desktop around
2007-11-02T20:00:00.000Z	RoyK	h1st0	ctrl+alt+left/right/middle click won't do much
2007-11-02T20:01:00.000Z	h1st0	RoyK	hold the left click down and drag the desktop while holding ctrl+alt
2007-11-02T20:01:00.000Z	h1st0	RoyK	you can also change teh zoom level etc... in the cube plugin settings
2007-11-02T20:04:00.000Z	RoyK	h1st0	I don't get it. It doesn't work. Desktop Cube and Rotate Cube are enabled
2007-11-02T20:06:00.000Z	h1st0	RoyK	maybe the shortcut isn't there?  Looki n the cube settings under the bound keys
2007-11-02T20:06:00.000Z	h1st0	RoyK	last tab
