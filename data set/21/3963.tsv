2008-09-12T03:12:00.000Z	carandraug	linkmaster03	System > Preferences > Keyboard
2008-09-12T03:12:00.000Z	linkmaster03	carandraug	i know, that's what i'm in. But I can't find out how to change the default layout
2008-09-12T03:13:00.000Z	carandraug	linkmaster03	mine has a tab called layout (but I'm on Intrepid)
2008-09-12T03:14:00.000Z	linkmaster03	carandraug	so does mine. i have two layouts. dvorak and qwerty. the radio button in the qwerty one is selected for default. how do I make dvorak the default?
2008-09-12T03:15:00.000Z	carandraug	linkmaster03	mine shows a list of keyboards, and on the right, there's a box that you tick for default
2008-09-12T03:15:00.000Z	linkmaster03	carandraug	the radio buttons on mine you cannot freely select
2008-09-12T03:16:00.000Z	carandraug	linkmaster03	hmm, don't know. I ave no problem selecting them. Is there any button with "unlock" somewhere?
2008-09-12T03:17:00.000Z	linkmaster03	carandraug	nope, no unlock
2008-09-12T03:17:00.000Z	linkmaster03	carandraug	if you know the name of the utility i can just gksudo it. cause I have to go eat
2008-09-12T03:18:00.000Z	carandraug	linkmaster03	that's easy to find out. In the menu, right click and choose add to panel.- Then go to the panel (where the shortcut is) and select preferences. That's how I do to find out
2008-09-12T03:19:00.000Z	carandraug	linkmaster03	in your case, the command is "gnome-keyboard-properties"
2008-09-12T03:57:00.000Z	linkmaster03	carandraug	ok im back. i ran the keyboard manager through gksudo and the layouts were totally separate from the normal user layouts. like root and my user have different settings
2008-09-12T03:58:00.000Z	carandraug	linkmaster03	yeah. Makes sense. You and root are different users
2008-09-12T03:59:00.000Z	linkmaster03	carandraug	sooo how can i unlock the radio button
2008-09-12T04:01:00.000Z	carandraug	linkmaster03	I didn't thought about root being a diferent user at the moment. Mine was never locked (well, actually it's the first time I went to that menu but it's not now now)
2008-09-12T04:02:00.000Z	carandraug	linkmaster03	maybe there's something in gconf-editor
2008-09-12T04:02:00.000Z	linkmaster03	carandraug	i'll just post on ubuntuforums :P
