2008-07-13T05:35:00.000Z	pteeb		anyone successfully get WC3 to run with WINE? mine is refusing
2008-07-13T05:36:00.000Z	Soul_Sample	pteeb	have you tried running it from the terminal? that way you can see where the error is
2008-07-13T05:36:00.000Z	pteeb		yeah, the problem is direct rendering: No (If you want to find out why, try setting LIBGL_DEBUG=verbose)
2008-07-13T05:36:00.000Z	pteeb		so the openGL wont run
