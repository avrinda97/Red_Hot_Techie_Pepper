2010-07-27T10:27:00.000Z	thune3	JViz	yes, it is possible.
2010-07-27T10:29:00.000Z	JViz	thune3	is it a simple process, or am i in for a whopper?
2010-07-27T10:29:00.000Z	thune3	JViz	depends on what you are trying to do.
2010-07-27T10:30:00.000Z	JViz	thune3	i have two hard drives and i want to be able to boot the same OS on one of the hard drives when booting from either drive in the bootlist
2010-07-27T10:31:00.000Z	JViz	thune3	bios bootlist, that is
2010-07-27T10:34:00.000Z	JViz	thune3	right now i'm dual booting and the bootloader is on a different drive than ubuntu, i'd like to be able to remove the hd of the other OS and still have a bootable system
2010-07-27T10:34:00.000Z	thune3	JViz	that doesn't sound very difficult, just installing grub to the mbr of both drives. checking command...
2010-07-27T10:36:00.000Z	JViz	thune3	grub-install /dev/sdb ?
2010-07-27T10:38:00.000Z	thune3	JViz	i think that's all there is to it.
2010-07-27T10:39:00.000Z	JViz	thune3	thank you! brb, gonna try it out
2010-07-27T11:01:00.000Z	JViz	thune3	thank you! it works perfectly
2010-07-27T11:01:00.000Z	thune3	JViz	cool.
2010-07-27T11:05:00.000Z	thune3	JViz	because your /boot/grub is on sdb, be aware that sdb will work without sda, but sda will not work without sdb.
2010-07-27T11:05:00.000Z	JViz	thune3	that's because grub is on sdb?
2010-07-27T11:06:00.000Z	thune3	JViz	right, the bootloader on sda points to /boot/grub on sdb. So if sdb is not there....
2010-07-27T11:06:00.000Z	JViz	thune3	ty
2010-07-27T11:07:00.000Z	thune3	JViz	sorry, just wanted to be extra clear. and np
2010-07-27T11:07:00.000Z	JViz	thune3	i could fix that by either making a grub partition on sda or using the windows bootloader on sda?
2010-07-27T11:08:00.000Z	thune3	JViz	right.
2010-07-27T11:09:00.000Z	thune3	JViz	i've seen people do just that, leave the windows bootloader on the windows disk. And point bios to the linux drive when they want grub.
2010-07-27T11:10:00.000Z	JViz	thune3	yeah, it seems like the thing to do
