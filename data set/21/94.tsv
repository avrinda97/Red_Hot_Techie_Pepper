2012-09-14T17:42:00.000Z	evil_cat		Can I make a question ?... :)
2012-09-14T17:42:00.000Z	evil_cat		I'm having problems accessing via web to the content in the /www/ dir hosted in my /home/user dir. Using lighttpd web-server-infraestructure. As I partitioned the disk, I can't allocate more than 5GB to my root partition. I set up the dir /home/user/www at 774 with Read and eXecute privileges to allocate the webs. The user allowed to acces to it is www-data. But probably permissions are not well setted up because I recieve 403 Forb
2012-09-14T17:42:00.000Z	evil_cat		.
2012-09-14T17:42:00.000Z	evil_cat		Could www-data privileges affect to access to home non-root directories? I'm so lost. I used a very simple directives in lighttpd.conf. The config file: http://paste.lighttpd.net/P#UAzTxSI39Sok3dkZ8s7lvRX9
2012-09-14T17:43:00.000Z	evil_cat		perhaps I need to change some fstab directives, to reach access to a different partition ?
2012-09-14T17:43:00.000Z	jrib	evil_cat	you want 775 on directories
2012-09-14T17:45:00.000Z	jrib	evil_cat	pastebin ls -ld / /home /home/user /home/user/www /home/user/www/page_in_question
2012-09-14T17:52:00.000Z	evil_cat	jrib	-rwxrwxr-x 1 root www-data 3569 2012-09-12 14:03 //home/metx/www/index.lighttpd.html
2012-09-14T17:53:00.000Z	jrib	evil_cat	this isn't what I asked
2012-09-14T17:54:00.000Z	jrib	evil_cat	pastebin: ls -ld / /home /home/user /home/user/www /home/user/www/page_in_question
2012-09-14T17:57:00.000Z	evil_cat	jrib	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1204808/
2012-09-14T17:57:00.000Z	jrib	evil_cat	you didn't include /home/metx
2012-09-14T18:00:00.000Z	jrib	evil_cat	but http://paste.lighttpd.net/P#UAzTxSI39Sok3dkZ8s7lvRX9 speaks about a "user1", not a "metx"
2012-09-14T18:02:00.000Z	jrib	evil_cat	is this ubuntu?
2012-09-14T18:04:00.000Z	jrib	evil_cat	as far as I can tell, /home/metx/www/index.lighttpd.html should be accessible to www-data
2012-09-14T18:06:00.000Z	jrib	evil_cat	right.  You're getting a 403 for your_server_ip/index.lighttpd.html, right?
2012-09-14T18:07:00.000Z	jrib	evil_cat	and just "your_server_ip", what do you get?
2012-09-14T18:09:00.000Z	jrib	evil_cat	you're sure you are checking the right server, correct?  Check the lighttpd logs (you may need to set one in your config)
2012-09-14T18:09:00.000Z	evil_cat	jrib	I can access to index.lighttpd.html by server_ip/index.lighttpd.html
2012-09-14T18:09:00.000Z	jrib	evil_cat	well you have index-file.names only as index.html
2012-09-14T18:11:00.000Z	jrib	evil_cat	my (default) index-file.names is: ( "index.php", "index.html", "index.htm", "default.htm", " index.lighttpd.html" )  I don't know what's up with that space there and I believe it may not even use index.lighttpd.html unless I remove the space
