2011-09-08T10:15:00.000Z	aple		Anyone know how to add Sublime Text 2 to Terminal?
2011-09-08T10:17:00.000Z	qin	aple	Where do you keep binary, path, please.
2011-09-08T10:20:00.000Z	aple	qin	What's the binary? The file I'm trying to use in terminal is: ~/apps/SublimeText2/sublime_text
2011-09-08T10:20:00.000Z	qin	aple	One sec
2011-09-08T10:23:00.000Z	qin	aple	Does: cd ~/apps/SublimeText2/ && ./sublime_text starts application?
2011-09-08T10:24:00.000Z	aple	qin	Yes
2011-09-08T10:26:00.000Z	qin	aple	In one line: cd ~ && echo "#!/bin/bash" > st.sh && echo "./apps/SublimeText2/sublime_text" >> st.sh && ./st.sh
2011-09-08T10:26:00.000Z	qin	aple	Dice?
2011-09-08T10:28:00.000Z	qin	aple	ups: cd ~ && chmod +x st.sh && ./st.sh
2011-09-08T10:30:00.000Z	aple	qin	!/bin/bash: event not found
2011-09-08T10:30:00.000Z	aple	qin	I did this the other night with someone in here and it was a lot simpler anyway. Something like a symlink to /usr/share
2011-09-08T10:30:00.000Z	qin	aple	Add # in fron of !
2011-09-08T10:30:00.000Z	aple	qin	I did
2011-09-08T10:32:00.000Z	aple	qin	It sucks because I specifically saved this easy one-liner in a .txt and then reformatted and forgot to back it up :)
2011-09-08T10:33:00.000Z	qin	aple	if st.sh will work from ~ you can put it in $PATH, so it will be proper launcher.
2011-09-08T10:34:00.000Z	qin	aple	File you just created: ls ~
2011-09-08T10:36:00.000Z	qin	aple	./st.sh (unless you changed name) or: bash st.sh
2011-09-08T10:38:00.000Z	aple	qin	Figured it out
2011-09-08T10:39:00.000Z	aple	qin	ln -s ~/apps/SublimeText2/sublime_text /usr/bin/st2
2011-09-08T10:40:00.000Z	qin	aple	Looks ok
2011-09-08T10:40:00.000Z	aple	qin	Now I'm an uber l33t hax0r :D
