2009-08-26T00:25:00.000Z	thingy	tavi	 pastebin output of glxinfo
2009-08-26T00:28:00.000Z	thingy	tavi	do you see? from your latest pastebin, you do not have any opengl modes available. What graphics card do you have on that box?
2009-08-26T00:28:00.000Z	thingy	tavi	also add my name to the start of your reply else I'll miss it!
2009-08-26T00:29:00.000Z	thingy	tavi	nvidia geforce 8600?
2009-08-26T00:31:00.000Z	thingy	tavi	have you enabled the use of nvidia hardware drivers? if you don't know, follow this guide --> http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Jaunty#Install_Latest_Nvidia.2FATI_drivers
2009-08-26T00:32:00.000Z	tavi	thingy	yes
2009-08-26T00:33:00.000Z	thingy	tavi	I don't think you have...also your pastebin output for glxinfo seems incomplete. Do this : "glxinfo > ~/glxinfo.txt" and pastebin the contents of the ~/glxinfo.txt file
2009-08-26T00:34:00.000Z	thingy	tavi	You are not using the hardware accelerated nvidia drivers and thats why you do not have any opengl modes available!
2009-08-26T00:35:00.000Z	tavi	thingy	http://paste.ubuntu.com/259459/
2009-08-26T00:36:00.000Z	thingy	tavi	You posted the same pastebin output as before..this is not complete! and no you do not have nvidia hardware drivers in use. Forget what the Hardware drives applet is saying
2009-08-26T00:37:00.000Z	tavi	thingy	don't know
2009-08-26T00:38:00.000Z	thingy	tavi	1. You are going to have to resolve your nvidia hardware drivers issue before opencity will work. To test if nvidia drivers are installed and working, look at the output of glxinfo. 2. To install the nvidia drivers manually, undo what you did in the hardware drivers (i.e. deselect the use of nvidia hardware drivers) and follow the guide on setting up nvidia drivers manually.
2009-08-26T00:39:00.000Z	tavi	thingy	i do not have jaunty
2009-08-26T00:41:00.000Z	thingy	tavi	1. I can't help you if do not paste the entire output of glxinfo. 2. The instructions of installing nvidia drivers manually are generic and so ubuntu version doesn't matter
2009-08-26T00:42:00.000Z	tavi	thingy	i gave it
2009-08-26T00:43:00.000Z	thingy	tavi	pastebin your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file
2009-08-26T00:54:00.000Z	thingy	tavi	The nvidia setup looks ok...it might that particular version of the nvidia driver -->169.12  Have you tried any other version of the nvidia driver available in ubuntu?
2009-08-26T00:54:00.000Z	tavi	thingy	yesss
