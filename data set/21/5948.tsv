2011-02-04T09:04:00.000Z	natex	ShaneN	are you using the corrent (VPN) ip address?
2011-02-04T09:04:00.000Z	ShaneN	natex	Yessir/mam
2011-02-04T09:09:00.000Z	natex	ShaneN	what ip are you ssh to once your vpn is connected?
2011-02-04T09:09:00.000Z	ShaneN	natex	10.10.0.33
2011-02-04T09:10:00.000Z	natex	ShaneN	right because it is not part of the vpn
2011-02-04T09:15:00.000Z	ShaneN	natex	SSH doesn't care which interface is used to connect to it, correct?
2011-02-04T09:15:00.000Z	natex	ShaneN	right
2011-02-04T09:15:00.000Z	natex	ShaneN	unless you've tweaked it to hell which I don't believe you have
2011-02-04T09:16:00.000Z	ShaneN	natex	Literally installed SSH today. Haven't touched it other after having these issues to try ListenAddress
2011-02-04T09:16:00.000Z	natex	ShaneN	you never know with ubuntu though :/
2011-02-04T09:17:00.000Z	ShaneN	natex	Thanks for the vote of confidence :). Tried centos first... had issues with the hardware though
2011-02-04T09:17:00.000Z	natex	ShaneN	honestly it just works with slackware
2011-02-04T09:18:00.000Z	natex	ShaneN	yeah something I'm missing here
2011-02-04T09:19:00.000Z	natex	ShaneN	try doing ssh -v
2011-02-04T09:20:00.000Z	ShaneN	natex	Hate to sound like a complete imbecile, but I'm on a windows box using putty. Not sure I can think of a way to generate a verbose log with it
2011-02-04T09:21:00.000Z	natex	ShaneN	it's there. you have to poke around at the left part of the window
2011-02-04T09:21:00.000Z	natex	ShaneN	logging
2011-02-04T09:21:00.000Z	ShaneN	natex	Found it (!!). Going to try now. Thank you
2011-02-04T09:22:00.000Z	natex	ShaneN	pastebin the log if you want
2011-02-04T09:28:00.000Z	natex	ShaneN	can you ssh to that box w/o vpn? Or do you have it FW'd?
2011-02-04T09:29:00.000Z	ShaneN	natex	I can SSH into it from a machine on the same LAN (VNC'd into a Windows box using putty to SSH into the ubuntu box)
