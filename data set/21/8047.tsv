2010-05-04T10:27:00.000Z	Geoffrey2		ok, what is the .xsession-errors file?
2010-05-04T10:27:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Geoffrey2	Um...it contains the errors that X spits forth when not playing nicely...
2010-05-04T10:29:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	YankDownUnder	mine has error messages created by it looking for stuff that doesn't exist anymore...
2010-05-04T10:29:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Geoffrey2	It's actually safe to delete that file mate...it gets recreated every time you fire up Xorg...
2010-05-04T10:30:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	YankDownUnder	which file?
2010-05-04T10:30:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Geoffrey2	the .xsession-errors
2010-05-04T10:30:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	YankDownUnder	yeah, but that won't solve the errors I keep getting
2010-05-04T10:30:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	YankDownUnder	gconf-sanity-check has a cow every time I boot up
2010-05-04T10:31:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Geoffrey2	What you can do (the purpose of this file) is to chase down the programs you DON'T have any longer, and remove them from your desktop environment, or any other related place...(or in settings, etc etc etc)
2010-05-04T10:32:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	YankDownUnder	I'd simply like to get rid of the nice box that pops up and tells me gconf-sanity-check-2 exited with a status 256
2010-05-04T10:34:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Geoffrey2	Have you tried removing gconf-sanity-check from the startup applications?
2010-05-04T10:35:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	YankDownUnder	it's not needed?
2010-05-04T10:37:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Geoffrey2	Well, depends on yer perspective. Does everything work already without it spitting forth a cow every time you boot?
2010-05-04T11:21:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	YankDownUnder	I believe you'd suggested simply removing gconf-sanity-check-2 from the startup list...problem is, I don't see it there...is there a file I need to modify to take it out?
2010-05-04T11:21:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Geoffrey2	I'll check - hang tight mate
2010-05-04T11:21:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	YankDownUnder	okie
2010-05-04T11:39:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	YankDownUnder	ok, tried the backup trick...lost a bunch of errors in the errors file, got a whole bunch of new errors, and I'm still getting that exit status 256 on startup
2010-05-04T11:28:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Geoffrey2	Check this: http://forums.fedoraforum.org/showthread.php?t=208427
2010-05-04T11:39:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Geoffrey2	Have you tried finding out what the "exit status" error means via Google or such?
2010-05-04T11:41:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	YankDownUnder	I've tried, problem is information overload, I get 30 different possible explanations, covering five different versions of ubuntu..figuring out which applies to me, that's the fun part
2010-05-04T11:43:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Geoffrey2	Well, the niggly stuff is what makes it all the more fun as a puzzle...as long as you can boot and use, it's all good...but it is kinda strange that...could be from a nonexistent program trying to startup via the init scdripts or in your startup....
