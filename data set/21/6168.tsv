2007-08-04T16:49:00.000Z	WeeJeWel		How can I make a link between a ext3 and NTFS partition?
2007-08-04T16:49:00.000Z	WeeJeWel		symbolic link
2007-08-04T16:50:00.000Z	WeeJeWel		auch
2007-08-04T16:50:00.000Z	WeeJeWel		it is mounted
2007-08-04T16:50:00.000Z	WeeJeWel		/media/hda1
2007-08-04T16:50:00.000Z	rausb0	WeeJeWel	you can create a symlink on the ext3 filesystem pointing to a file or dir on the ntfs filesystem, but not vice versa
2007-08-04T16:51:00.000Z	WeeJeWel	rausb0	why do i get an error then?
2007-08-04T16:51:00.000Z	rausb0	WeeJeWel	what is the exact command you gave?
2007-08-04T16:51:00.000Z	WeeJeWel		link "/media/hda1/" "y:"
2007-08-04T16:51:00.000Z	rausb0	WeeJeWel	totally wrong syntax
2007-08-04T16:52:00.000Z	WeeJeWel		* Feels stupid :P
2007-08-04T16:52:00.000Z	rausb0	WeeJeWel	and btw, you can't use drive letters in linux
2007-08-04T16:52:00.000Z	WeeJeWel		nonono
2007-08-04T16:52:00.000Z	WeeJeWel		its for wine
2007-08-04T16:52:00.000Z	WeeJeWel		dosdevices
2007-08-04T16:52:00.000Z	WeeJeWel		invalid option -s
2007-08-04T16:52:00.000Z	rausb0	WeeJeWel	so it is not a symbolic link at all, but an entry in the wine config?
2007-08-04T16:52:00.000Z	WeeJeWel		yes
2007-08-04T16:53:00.000Z	rausb0	WeeJeWel	then don't speak of a link
2007-08-04T16:53:00.000Z	WeeJeWel	rausb0	in dosdevices there are links
2007-08-04T16:53:00.000Z	rausb0	WeeJeWel	alright. i don't use wine or any windows software at all.
