2007-10-05T05:20:00.000Z	garethb		thanks Dj, I am trying to install Campcaster and it tells me to add the file to my www directory that apache uses only problem is there is no www directory there
2007-10-05T05:21:00.000Z	garethb		thanks mrak
2007-10-05T05:23:00.000Z	garethb		Does anybody know about the www directory and how to make i appear in user groups?
2007-10-05T05:24:00.000Z	garethb		Dj i'm not sure what the means i have been told to add campcast to the www.directory in user groups
2007-10-05T05:24:00.000Z	garethb		i was trying to do it through the ubuntu gui
2007-10-05T05:25:00.000Z	Muelli	garethb	you want to add the user "campcast" to the group named "www"?
2007-10-05T05:25:00.000Z	Muelli	garethb	then you might want to use "gpasswd -a $user $group"
2007-10-05T05:25:00.000Z	Muelli	garethb	so you don't have a group named "www"?
2007-10-05T05:26:00.000Z	Muelli	garethb	what do you actually want to achieve? -.-
2007-10-05T05:26:00.000Z	Muelli	garethb	to just add a group you could do "groupadd $group" but it's most likely that this won't solve your issue
2007-10-05T05:26:00.000Z	Muelli	garethb	I have no idea what campcast is...
2007-10-05T05:27:00.000Z	Muelli	garethb	no no. What's the issue? I mean what is the problem now
2007-10-05T05:28:00.000Z	garethb	Muelli	i'm following a set of instructions and the www user group is not displaying in the user groups so I cannot add myself to it or I'm not even sure whether or not its me or the program that needs to be added
2007-10-05T05:29:00.000Z	garethb	Muelli	I hope that didnt sound rude -I didnt mean it to :-)
2007-10-05T05:39:00.000Z	Muelli	garethb	actually no. rm can just delete files. But "deletion" does not mean that it's really deleted most of the time. It's just freed. The data itself still lies on the harddisk.
2007-10-05T05:39:00.000Z	Muelli	garethb	most likely, yes.
