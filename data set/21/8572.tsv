2006-12-05T15:29:00.000Z	shooshu		has any one else had any problems after they updated? like "/bin/sh; can't access tty; job control turned off - and it wont let them get past the damn annoying black screen
2006-12-05T15:29:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	shooshu	not had that problem yet with today's updates of libgsf and xine.
2006-12-05T15:31:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	shooshu	well, you can goto the store and buy a copy of windows with a windows license.
2006-12-05T15:31:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	shooshu	I forget the price but windows home retail is like 95USD
2006-12-05T15:32:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	shooshu	that's great and all. But if you don't have a windows cd, you're not going to be able to install windows.
2006-12-05T15:34:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	shooshu	yet you're on IRC right now...
2006-12-05T15:34:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	shooshu	well, what's the problem with ubuntu currently?
2006-12-05T15:36:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	shooshu	login and type startx.
2006-12-05T15:38:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	shooshu	type the command 'startx'
2006-12-05T15:40:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	shooshu	okay.. type in 'apt-get install ubuntu-desktop' this should download the default ubuntu desktop  and so on.
2006-12-05T15:41:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	shooshu	# is fine. It just means you're logged in as root.
2006-12-05T15:42:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	shooshu	okay.. you don't even have the ubuntu base installed...
2006-12-05T15:42:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	shooshu	what the hell happened?
2006-12-05T15:43:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	shooshu	'cd /' then 'ls'
2006-12-05T15:47:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	shooshu	there is no /home folder ?
2006-12-05T15:50:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	shooshu	'ls /dev/hd*' ?
2006-12-05T15:52:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	shooshu	type in 'bash', then try 'ls /dev/hd*' again
2006-12-05T15:53:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	shooshu	well, to be honest. What happened to your system baffles me, it's like someone puposely got into it, configured it that way and removed all the useful utilities.
2006-12-05T15:56:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	shooshu	gah.. You have no logs. Would you happen to have the ubuntu cd on you?
2006-12-05T15:57:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	shooshu	I take it he installed ubuntu and so on?
2006-12-05T15:59:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	shooshu	you really need to get the ubuntu cd or get your ex to help you. :/
