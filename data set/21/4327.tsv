2010-07-12T15:04:00.000Z	rukubites		Hi all, I am having trouble detecting my hard drive. I am doing an
2010-07-12T15:04:00.000Z	rukubites		     alternate install because of this. How do I find out which disk
2010-07-12T15:04:00.000Z	rukubites		     driver I need?
2010-07-12T15:04:00.000Z	rukubites		sorry for the multi-line
2010-07-12T15:05:00.000Z	SwedeMike	rukubites	are you sure it's not your controller you need driver for? what kind of special drive do you have?
2010-07-12T15:06:00.000Z	rukubites	SwedeMike	om26er: It is detected by Windows 7, but not by Ubuntu 10.04. It is a WD Sata2 drive. And I might need a controller driver, I don't know.
2010-07-12T15:07:00.000Z	SwedeMike	rukubites	focus on finding out what controller you have and see if you have multiple controllers, move the drive to one that is supported by linux.
2010-07-12T15:08:00.000Z	rukubites	SwedeMike	You mean go into the machine and switch the plug? It is on controller 0, I think. Is that what you mean?
2010-07-12T15:08:00.000Z	SwedeMike	rukubites	yes.
2010-07-12T15:09:00.000Z	rukubites	SwedeMike	So the BIOS sees Controller 1-6 (including #3, the DVD). I need to move the WD from controller 0 to controller 1?
2010-07-12T15:10:00.000Z	SwedeMike	rukubites	you seem to be talking about ports, not controller. If you have an onboard ICH controller try switching it to AHCI-mode in bios.
2010-07-12T15:10:00.000Z	rukubites	SwedeMike	I did that
2010-07-12T15:11:00.000Z	rukubites	SwedeMike	It is in AHCI mode now.
2010-07-12T15:11:00.000Z	SwedeMike	rukubites	I doubt it'll help to move between ports on the same controller.
2010-07-12T15:12:00.000Z	rukubites	SwedeMike	I'm not a hardware guy. You're right, I was talking about ports.
2010-07-12T15:17:00.000Z	rukubites	SwedeMike	Can you help further?
2010-07-12T15:17:00.000Z	SwedeMike	rukubites	not really. I've given you the hints I would use myself.
2010-07-12T15:18:00.000Z	rukubites	SwedeMike	Fair enough. I am confused whether you thought I should go in and mess with the hardware?
2010-07-12T15:19:00.000Z	SwedeMike	rukubites	whether I thought it, or why I thought it?
2010-07-12T15:19:00.000Z	SwedeMike	rukubites	if you connected the drive to some 2 channel special controller on the motherboard it would have made sense to move it to the main 6channel controller, but you already did that so...
2010-07-12T15:19:00.000Z	rukubites	SwedeMike	I haven't played with the innards. I bought the box today.
