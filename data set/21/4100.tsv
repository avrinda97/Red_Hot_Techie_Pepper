2012-05-03T18:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gaelfx	 ive seen mplayer have a 'asciiart' video out plugin.
2012-05-03T18:49:00.000Z	gaelfx	Dr_willis	yeah, it's probably the same thing VLC uses
2012-05-04T15:19:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gaelfx	 i thought update-grub rescanned the uuids and set them up
2012-05-04T15:19:00.000Z	gaelfx	Dr_willis	totally possible, but it seems he's tried that and it's still not working
2012-05-04T15:38:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gaelfx	 that option seem to just change to the   root=/dev/sdb2  syntax:wq
2012-05-04T15:39:00.000Z	gaelfx	Dr_willis	does it remake /etc/default/grub as well? I thought only /boot/grub/grub.cfg?
2012-05-04T15:45:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gaelfx	 you edit /etc/default/grub :) so thats where you put the changes it then applies to the grub.cfg
2012-05-04T15:46:00.000Z	gaelfx	Dr_willis	yeah, but do kernel updates actually re-write the /etc/default/grub settings?
2012-05-04T15:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gaelfx	 it shouldent. without asking at least.. now a grub2 update could ask to change the file and revert to package mainteners default and so forth
2012-05-04T15:58:00.000Z	gaelfx	Dr_willis	you said before that you had no troubles with cloning systems, how did you clone them?
2012-05-04T15:58:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gaelfx	 i just dd'd the flash drive to a bigger flash and  booted it. and reran gparted to resize the existing pariton i belive.
2012-05-04T15:58:00.000Z	gaelfx	Dr_willis	I mean, did you use rsync or what?
2012-05-04T15:58:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gaelfx	 just used dd and gparted i recall.. been a while.
2012-05-04T15:59:00.000Z	gaelfx	Dr_willis	thanks, I'm an idiot and never would have realized that that's the way to do it
2012-05-04T15:59:00.000Z	gaelfx	Dr_willis	would cat work as well?
2012-05-04T16:00:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gaelfx	 one neat trick was if i moved the new copy pendrive to a 2nd pc.. (so one pc didenthave 2 pen drives with the same uuids) i could boot that pc. run update-grub and it would see the pendriveinstall. so IF i had any issues i could use that pc to boot the pendrive and try to fix things.
2012-05-05T16:20:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gaelfx	 i think the UEFI one appears due to some new grub/syslinux features. I see the same thing. but i never tried the UEFI one. :)
2012-05-05T16:20:00.000Z	gaelfx	Dr_willis	well, apparently you are cleverer than I
2012-05-05T16:21:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gaelfx	 the UEFI option was a the bottom of the list i thought. :) so im not sure why you tried it first.
2012-05-05T16:21:00.000Z	gaelfx	Dr_willis	I didn't even look at the other one
2012-07-04T14:56:00.000Z	gaelfx	Dr_willis	not all of them, some of the 12 inchers are pretty decent hw
