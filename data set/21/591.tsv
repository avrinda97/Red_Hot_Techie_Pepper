2011-09-10T04:13:00.000Z	billybigrigger		anyone here have experience with NFS shares on a wireless N network?
2011-09-10T04:14:00.000Z	vfw_	billybigrigger	Yes
2011-09-10T04:15:00.000Z	billybigrigger	vfw_	i can't seem to get more than 8.8Mbits/s on a file transfer...that works out to 1MB/s
2011-09-10T04:19:00.000Z	vfw_	billybigrigger	What is the signal report?
2011-09-10T04:23:00.000Z	vfw_	billybigrigger	Have  you captured some packets to see if there are  retries?

2011-09-10T04:25:00.000Z	vfw_	billybigrigger	2.4GHz porpagation requires line-of-sight and you may need to improve location(s).

2011-09-10T04:30:00.000Z	billybigrigger	vfw_	?
2011-09-10T04:34:00.000Z	vfw_	billybigrigger	Sorry, was on the phone
2011-09-10T04:36:00.000Z	vfw_	billybigrigger	Ok signal report looks good "Link Quality=69/70"  but that is only half the story and you would have to see what it looks like from the other end.  If is that good or better, great, if it is lower, not so good....
2011-09-10T04:38:00.000Z	vfw_	billybigrigger	Another thing,  you need to look at it a number of times and if you see the signal report fluctuating quite a bit, you be fairly sure that there is an interrference problem, which could be intermod or whatever.
2011-09-10T04:39:00.000Z	vfw_	billybigrigger	If you have a low signal report or interference problem there will be retries...
2011-09-10T04:41:00.000Z	vfw_	billybigrigger	and it could be a bad signal-to-noise ratio on either end.
2011-09-10T04:42:00.000Z	vfw_	billybigrigger	In other words, there are a lot of factors to consider and some may be unseen ...
2011-09-10T04:43:00.000Z	billybigrigger	vfw_	for some reason, loading a directory on the nfs share takes ages too....
2011-09-10T04:44:00.000Z	vfw_	billybigrigger	I doubt it, but you run a hardline and see.
2011-09-10T04:48:00.000Z	billybigrigger	vfw_	it must be an option someone
2011-09-10T04:52:00.000Z	billybigrigger	vfw_	maybe i'm looking at iftop wrong, do you know another bandwidth monitor i can use? maybe the numbers are messed....i dunno
2011-09-10T04:59:00.000Z	vfw_	billybigrigger	I don't know really.  All I can do is give you possiblilities.  You could just use trial and error, like improve your location on one or both ends.
2011-09-10T05:00:00.000Z	vfw_	billybigrigger	For best performance 2.4GHz needs clear line of sight.
