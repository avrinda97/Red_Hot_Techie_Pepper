2007-10-14T09:38:00.000Z	erin		Hi, everyone. How can I stop my laptop screen from turning white and freaking out between the splash screen and the GNOME login? Thanks!

2007-10-14T09:39:00.000Z	erin	IcemanV9	It's a brand new Presario laptop. I actually had the same thing happen on an Acer.
2007-10-14T09:40:00.000Z	IcemanV9	erin	? ok.. which version of ubuntu did you installed?
2007-10-14T09:40:00.000Z	erin	IcemanV9	Ubuntu 7.04
2007-10-14T09:41:00.000Z	erin	IcemanV9	It totally took over the screen until I added "vga=792" to the boot options on the advice of a blog.
2007-10-14T09:42:00.000Z	IcemanV9	erin	feisty .. is there anything in log files that might give you a hint? dmesg, messages, Xorg.0.log?
2007-10-14T09:42:00.000Z	IcemanV9	erin	yea. that is good. it should help, but you said it does not completely resolved.
2007-10-14T09:43:00.000Z	erin	IcemanV9	How do I check those log files?
2007-10-14T09:44:00.000Z	IcemanV9	erin	/var/log
2007-10-14T09:47:00.000Z	erin	IcemanV9	Here's what's in Xorg.0.log http://pastebin.com/m7ed9e072
2007-10-14T09:50:00.000Z	IcemanV9	erin	 a bit ... try to turn off aiglx .. and i am not familiar with nvidia like i am with ati
2007-10-14T09:51:00.000Z	IcemanV9	erin	look for (EE) lines; that is usually a hint :-)
2007-10-14T09:52:00.000Z	erin	IcemanV9	In what file should I look for the EE line? The one I just posted?
2007-10-14T09:52:00.000Z	IcemanV9	erin	as i understand from others and forums, nvidia is usually a good driver compared to nv
2007-10-14T09:52:00.000Z	IcemanV9	erin	yeah, the one you posted.
2007-10-14T09:53:00.000Z	erin	IcemanV9	There are no EE entries. I'll try the restricted driver, then. brb
2007-10-14T10:41:00.000Z	IcemanV9	erin	no more white screen?
2007-10-14T10:42:00.000Z	erin	IcemanV9	Nope! nvidia-glx-new did it.
2007-10-14T10:42:00.000Z	IcemanV9	erin	awesome! now you can enjoy it without an annoying problem that occupied your mind past few days. :-)
2007-10-14T10:44:00.000Z	erin	IcemanV9	Yes, until I find something else to mess up
