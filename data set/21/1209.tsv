2011-08-19T05:00:00.000Z	Kamikaze	exutux	therefore im here, to make sure what im doing :)
2011-08-19T05:00:00.000Z	exutux	Kamikaze	and so install not full type
2011-08-19T05:01:00.000Z	Kamikaze	exutux	the full one isn't as good as half version ?
2011-08-19T05:01:00.000Z	exutux	Kamikaze	I mean using metasploit... not dangerous for install it, but for exploit
2011-08-19T05:02:00.000Z	exutux	Kamikaze	for full version you need databases and other stuff installed
2011-08-19T05:02:00.000Z	Kamikaze	exutux	oh i got it thanks, now im gonna download the half one, i didn't know that it requires DB and stuff like that, thanks Sr

2011-08-19T05:05:00.000Z	exutux	Kamikaze	there are a lot of guide's , google it
2011-08-19T05:06:00.000Z	Kamikaze	exutux	im wondering, is full version does more than half version? i mean abilities, duties, privileges, advantages ?
2011-08-19T05:07:00.000Z	exutux	Kamikaze	that it doesn't matter with Ubuntu or linux....
2011-08-19T05:08:00.000Z	exutux	Kamikaze	linux = hacker ? you wrong ;)
2011-08-19T05:08:00.000Z	Kamikaze	exutux	ya i know but i dont handle any kind of Linux or Unix, I'm coming from Windows 7
2011-08-19T05:09:00.000Z	Kamikaze	exutux	really?) then how come REAL hackers using linux unix to hack ) are you hinting about Back|Track ;) ?
2011-08-19T05:10:00.000Z	exutux	Kamikaze	good luck
2011-08-19T05:11:00.000Z	Kamikaze	exutux	sad:( i turned it into executable, i ran it and now it says " This installer requires root privileges. Please become superuser before executing the installer" but this is my one and only account which is the root (
2011-08-19T05:13:00.000Z	exutux	Kamikaze	so how I said before you don't know what are you doing...so read and learn basic use about linux before, use that dagerous programs....dabgerous for you and for other people sometomes
