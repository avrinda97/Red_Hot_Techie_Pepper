2011-12-09T11:10:00.000Z	glitchd	polardude1983	so your trying to run this program "ted" from inside the live cd?
2011-12-09T11:11:00.000Z	glitchd	polardude1983	ok now im confused..
2011-12-09T11:12:00.000Z	glitchd	polardude1983	your on a live cd trying to run a program thats installed on the actual hd?
2011-12-09T11:12:00.000Z	polardude1983	glitchd	no. I never said i was on a live cd :)
2011-12-09T11:12:00.000Z	glitchd	polardude1983	lol sry man too many conversations
2011-12-09T11:12:00.000Z	polardude1983	glitchd	lol its ok :)
2011-12-09T11:13:00.000Z	glitchd	polardude1983	i would right click the file and check to make sure that its executable
2011-12-09T11:13:00.000Z	polardude1983	glitchd	it is executable :) i checked
2011-12-09T11:14:00.000Z	glitchd	polardude1983	hmm....whats the exact error it gives u?
2011-12-09T11:14:00.000Z	polardude1983	glitchd	http://paste.ubuntu.com/764617/
2011-12-09T11:16:00.000Z	glitchd	polardude1983	i would suggest redownloading the program in  linux and trying it again. possibly one thats made for linux?
2011-12-09T11:16:00.000Z	polardude1983	glitchd	unfortunately the linux version is the ted.jar from www.ted.nu
2011-12-09T11:16:00.000Z	glitchd	polardude1983	 so its the same version then, or older?
2011-12-09T11:17:00.000Z	polardude1983	glitchd	when i download the linux version from ted.nu it is a zip file that contains ted.jar and other files
2011-12-09T11:18:00.000Z	glitchd	polardude1983	ok so extract it and try to run the .jar file and see if it works
2011-12-09T11:19:00.000Z	polardude1983	glitchd	nope does not work
2011-12-09T11:19:00.000Z	glitchd	polardude1983	pm me
