2009-07-02T03:45:00.000Z	evon	usr13	i just want everything to mount when i boot into linux
2009-07-02T03:50:00.000Z	evon	usr13	? able to help?
2009-07-02T03:51:00.000Z	usr13	evon	Ok, everythings mounting already accept for sda2 and sda3 so you can create entries for them, but first you have to create mount points.  You can name them something similar to NTFS1 and NTFS2 or MS1 and MS2, etc.  it is up to you, but you have to create the mount points like this:  mkdir /MS1 /MS2  and then add lines to your fstab file like this:  /dev/sda2  /MS1  ntfs  noauto,user,rw  0 0   #and   /dev/sda3 /MS2 ntfs  noauto,user,rw  0 0
