2010-09-27T23:30:00.000Z	unperson		Just tried to apt-get install the flashplugin-installer from the Ubuntu repos.  The .deb downloaded fine, but then during the config stage it gave a 404 error when it tried to download the actual plugin.  Anyone know what's going on?
2010-09-27T23:31:00.000Z	wac_	unperson	try using the software center and installing the free community flash plug in
2010-09-27T23:33:00.000Z	unperson	wac_	The thing is that I want the actual Adobe plugin, and clearly something with the ubuntu package is fubar.
2010-09-27T23:33:00.000Z	unperson	wac_	I can probably download directly from adobe and install, but I'd much prefer to know what's going on with the official package.
2010-09-27T23:34:00.000Z	unperson	wac_	What's weird is that a quick search didn't turn up any recent references to such a phenomenon.
2010-09-27T23:44:00.000Z	wac_	unperson	haha
2010-09-27T23:44:00.000Z	wac_	unperson	did you reproduce it with apt-get autoremove
2010-09-27T23:50:00.000Z	unperson	wac_	I don't think you can do it on the fly.
2010-09-27T23:52:00.000Z	unperson	wac_	Regarding the flash thing, oddly if I try their code to reproduce it something else happens.  It then appears to install without errors, though flash doesn't actually work.
2010-09-28T00:08:00.000Z	unperson	wac_	Trying to figure out how I determine whent he mirror was last updated.  I guess I can probably look at the mod time for the packages file.
2010-09-27T23:52:00.000Z	unperson	wac_	What's even MORE bizarre about that is that flashplugin-nonfree is a transitional package, and I thought all it really goes is install flashplugin-installer, which is what I'd been doing.
2010-09-27T23:53:00.000Z	wac_	unperson	you tried the apt-update they told you to I am assuming?
2010-09-27T23:53:00.000Z	wac_	unperson	did you enable the restricted repo in sources
2010-09-27T23:56:00.000Z	unperson	wac_	I did update.  But in any case I've updated apt far more recently than those bug posts.  restricted repo must be enabled otherwise it wouldn't find the package at all, right?
2010-09-28T00:03:00.000Z	wac_	unperson	yea I guess so
2010-09-28T00:03:00.000Z	unperson	wac_	I think I got to the bottom of the issue.
2010-09-28T00:04:00.000Z	unperson	wac_	The mirror I was using seems to be out of date.
2010-09-28T00:04:00.000Z	unperson	wac_	When I set it to use the main US mirror everything works out.
2010-09-28T00:04:00.000Z	wac_	unperson	you changed the mirriors around? or do you not live in the US
2010-09-28T00:05:00.000Z	unperson	wac_	I changed mirrors to one that I get much faster speeds to.
2010-09-28T00:05:00.000Z	unperson	wac_	But it appears that mirror is out of date.
