2008-08-31T22:35:00.000Z	newton	unop	: sudo: must be setuid root (*)
2008-08-31T22:36:00.000Z	unop	newton	heh, how did you manage to do that?
2008-08-31T22:36:00.000Z	newton	unop	some stupid lamer told me cpanel could work on ubuntu
2008-08-31T22:37:00.000Z	unop	newton	you will need to boot up into recovery mode and run this command.  chmod u+s /usr/bin/sudo
2008-08-31T22:37:00.000Z	newton	unop	that server doesn;t stands next to me :S
2008-08-31T22:37:00.000Z	unop	newton	you're pretty much stuck then .. your service provider might have some recovery procedure you can follow
2008-08-31T22:38:00.000Z	newton	unop	i own that server, but its located elsewhere :S
2008-08-31T22:39:00.000Z	newton	unop	is there no other way to kinda start recovery mode?
2008-08-31T22:39:00.000Z	unop	newton	well, what can i say? without sudo you can't become root
2008-08-31T22:39:00.000Z	unop	newton	are you sshed in at the moment?
2008-08-31T22:39:00.000Z	newton	unop	Yes
2008-08-31T22:40:00.000Z	unop	newton	there is no legit. way
2008-08-31T22:41:00.000Z	newton	unop	but u mean there is 'a' way?
2008-08-31T22:41:00.000Z	unop	newton	how did you manage to upset the permissions on /usr/bin/sudo ?
2008-08-31T22:41:00.000Z	newton	unop	an unsupported way, well unop i didnt' by cpanel installtion did, better i didn't even tried the damn thing
2008-08-31T22:42:00.000Z	unop	newton	well, you could compromise your server by some exploit of some kind  .. but that's beyond the scope of this channel.
2008-08-31T22:42:00.000Z	newton	unop	ehm :S
2008-08-31T22:43:00.000Z	newton	unop	i mean, it must be possible to start je recovery mode, without restart & from remote :S
2008-08-31T22:44:00.000Z	unop	newton	well no, you need to be root (via sudo) to be able to change runlevels or shutdown/reboot etc .. but you can't use sudo, so you have a catch 22.
