2010-07-12T00:13:00.000Z	Slimp		Can anyone tell me how to setup ubuntu so I can vnc in after a restart?
2010-07-12T00:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Slimp	  You can always 'ssh' in and start vncserver after you insstall vncserver. You dont need to share teh 'current local viewable desktop'
2010-07-12T00:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Slimp	 you then connect via any vnc client.
2010-07-12T00:14:00.000Z	Slimp	Dr_Willis	how?
2010-07-12T00:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Slimp	 Or you set up auto login, with the gnome vnc server/shareing enabled.
2010-07-12T00:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Slimp	 install vncserver.. ssh in.. how to what part?
2010-07-12T00:15:00.000Z	Slimp	Dr_Willis	how to starting up the server.
2010-07-12T00:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Slimp	 install vncserver and run .. 'vncserver'
2010-07-12T00:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Slimp	 is one way.
2010-07-12T00:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Slimp	 no... you dont run vncserver as root.. its ran by the user sshing in.
2010-07-12T00:16:00.000Z	Slimp	Dr_Willis	so the command is just vncserver?  No flags or anything?
2010-07-12T00:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Slimp	 theres dozens of options and flags you could use..
2010-07-12T00:17:00.000Z	Slimp	Dr_Willis	of course, but non-required for what I want to do, right?
2010-07-12T00:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Slimp	 but the common way i do it.. ssh to remote, run 'vncserver' , on local machine use 'vncviewer remoteboxip'
2010-07-12T00:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Slimp	 i dont know what you 'want to do' other then you asked how to start vnc..
2010-07-12T00:18:00.000Z	Slimp	Dr_Willis	that's what I want to do.
2010-07-12T01:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Slimp	 you can set the keyring password to be empty and it wont ask.. it will just auto-allow it.
2010-07-12T01:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Slimp	 applications -> acessories -> passwords and keys
2010-07-12T01:18:00.000Z	Slimp	Dr_Willis	sure, but where is the option for that?
2010-07-12T01:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Slimp	 right click on one of the items (i forget what)_ and you can change the password. set it to be empty it will then ask that you want to use insecure passwords. say yes
2010-07-12T01:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Slimp	 its in that tool.. try the right click menus.
