2012-08-23T19:42:00.000Z	MoTec		Does NFS allow unix style permissions?  I mean, if I use a NFS share on a remote server as my users home folders can I set appropriate permissions?  I know I can't with samba/cifs
2012-08-23T19:44:00.000Z	MoTec		It's a Windows Storage Server 2008.. I guess I experiement and find out.. :)
2012-08-23T19:46:00.000Z	MoTec		NTFS is POSIX complaint.. Oh ,maybe not for ACLS, tho.
2012-08-23T19:46:00.000Z	MoTec		just naming, links, and timestamps
2012-08-23T19:47:00.000Z	MoTec		hard links are, from what i'm readying.. but acl are not
2012-08-23T19:49:00.000Z	MoTec		Well darn.. So I guess my hope of having /home on a windows server is a lost cause?
2012-08-23T19:50:00.000Z	auronandace	MoTec	why on earth would you put /home on ntfs?
2012-08-23T19:51:00.000Z	MoTec	auronandace	my MAS has six TB of storage.. centralized backup.. built in redundancy..
2012-08-23T19:51:00.000Z	auronandace	MoTec	why ntfs?
2012-08-23T19:52:00.000Z	MoTec	auronandace	it's a Windows Storage Server.
2012-08-23T19:52:00.000Z	auronandace	MoTec	as others have already told you /home on ntfs is a bad idea
2012-08-23T19:54:00.000Z	auronandace	MoTec	why not use a seperate storage partition?
2012-08-23T19:54:00.000Z	MoTec	auronandace	i could i guess.. but i wanted it on the Windows NAS.. And I wouldn't know what other filesystem to use other than NTFS.
2012-08-23T19:57:00.000Z	auronandace	MoTec	what do you put on the /home partitions that you need access to them from windows?
2012-08-23T19:58:00.000Z	auronandace	MoTec	i just don't get why you can't just save a whole lot of bother and use a seperate storage partition
2012-08-23T19:58:00.000Z	MoTec	auronandace	it's files transfered from vendors.. they were using ftp but for hipaa compliance i'm switching that to sftp.
2012-08-23T19:58:00.000Z	MoTec	auronandace	seperate storage partition where?
2012-08-23T19:59:00.000Z	auronandace	MoTec	there is no hard and fast rule that says you must absolutely use /home as a storage partition
2012-08-23T20:00:00.000Z	MoTec	auronandace	yeah, i actually had their home folders on my samba share but had permission issues.
2012-08-23T20:00:00.000Z	auronandace	MoTec	yeah, you don't put /home on ntfs
2012-08-23T20:02:00.000Z	MoTec	auronandace	yeah, so it's all the same issue.. i'll just share the home folders from ubuntu instead of putting them on the NAS
