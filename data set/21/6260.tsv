2007-04-30T09:09:00.000Z	R3ddy	variant	erhm.. ubuntu desktop 7.04
2007-04-30T09:10:00.000Z	variant	R3ddy	then you should have a network manager that lists avaialable wireless networks in the top right of the window
2007-04-30T09:11:00.000Z	R3ddy	variant	yes, i connect to NETGEAR, my issd, but the internet connection isnt there
2007-04-30T09:12:00.000Z	variant	R3ddy	strange, you can't ping www.google.com?
2007-04-30T09:12:00.000Z	variant	R3ddy	can you ping this ip address: 216.239.59.104
2007-04-30T09:12:00.000Z	variant	R3ddy	ah

2007-04-30T09:13:00.000Z	variant	R3ddy	so, does the network manager say "connecting to ... etc"?
2007-04-30T09:13:00.000Z	variant	R3ddy	when you select your netowrk what happens exactly?
2007-04-30T09:13:00.000Z	R3ddy	variant	nothing, really.. i select NETGEAR, and i click the OK button
2007-04-30T10:41:00.000Z	variant	R3ddy	 a firewall is advisable, av no
2007-04-30T10:43:00.000Z	variant	R3ddy	there are example viruses, none that are currently active "in the wild" and none that can self propagate to any great extent
2007-04-30T10:43:00.000Z	variant	R3ddy	they are all proof of concept viruses
2007-04-30T10:44:00.000Z	variant	R3ddy	pici's description is a good one..
2007-05-01T05:10:00.000Z	variant	R3ddy	gtkpod, amarok, etc
