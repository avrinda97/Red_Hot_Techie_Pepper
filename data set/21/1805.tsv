2011-07-03T18:41:00.000Z	grmrgecko		Can I get Ubuntu 11 to work on a Pentium 3?
2011-07-03T18:41:00.000Z	grmrgecko		good
2011-07-03T18:41:00.000Z	grmrgecko		then I am not trouble shooting for nothing.
2011-07-03T18:42:00.000Z	grmrgecko		It's a 600MHz with 256MB of ram.
2011-07-03T18:42:00.000Z	grmrgecko		same specs of my iPod:P
2011-07-03T18:44:00.000Z	grmrgecko		if I can't get kubuntu to work
2011-07-03T18:45:00.000Z	grmrgecko		I just need some type of linux:P
2011-07-03T18:45:00.000Z	grmrgecko		windows isn't a good way to scan for viruses
2011-07-03T18:47:00.000Z	grmrgecko		maybe debian will work
2011-07-03T18:47:00.000Z	grmrgecko		I know Ubuntu is debian based
2011-07-03T18:47:00.000Z	acicula	grmrgecko	ubuntu and debian have the same origins but are very different
2011-07-03T18:48:00.000Z	acicula	grmrgecko	if you need something userfriendly id stick with ubuntu or fedora
2011-07-03T18:49:00.000Z	acicula	grmrgecko	i suppose im just a lazy geek :)
2011-07-03T18:49:00.000Z	acicula	grmrgecko	whats the problem you are having? not enough ram?
2011-07-03T18:49:00.000Z	grmrgecko	acicula	In Hiren's boot cd trying to run spy bot search and destory
2011-07-03T18:50:00.000Z	acicula	grmrgecko	eh i dont know anything about a Hirens boot cd
2011-07-03T18:56:00.000Z	acicula	grmrgecko	wipe it and start again?
2011-07-03T18:56:00.000Z	grmrgecko	acicula	I do not like window's license crap
2011-07-03T18:57:00.000Z	acicula	grmrgecko	yeah, but using windows XP SP1 is aking to going on vacation, leaving all the doors open and placing an add in the newspaper about how you will not be home the next few weeks
2011-07-03T18:58:00.000Z	acicula	grmrgecko	anyway if you suspect you have a virus that msrt didnt find there is no guarantee that clamav will either, especially since its only a passive scan. if you suspect you have/had malware wiping and reinstalling is your safest option.
2011-07-03T18:59:00.000Z	grmrgecko	acicula	I believe it has one because everytime I boot, MSSE is off
