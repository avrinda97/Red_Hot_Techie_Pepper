2006-11-06T08:09:00.000Z	hanasaki2		how do i force a package to be uninstalled that is giving errors on apt-get remove --purge
2006-11-06T08:11:00.000Z	hanasaki2		i am upgrading to edgy from dapper... courier-authdaemon upgrade is failing.. and i cant even apt-get remove it due to " Package is in a very bad inconsistent state - you should reinstall it before remove.. "  but reinstall fails too
2006-11-06T08:11:00.000Z	crimsun	hanasaki2	it's a bug, and we know about it. No ETA on a fixed package.

2006-11-06T08:17:00.000Z	crimsun	hanasaki2	there's a bug report on it if you search Malone (https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu )
2006-11-06T08:17:00.000Z	crimsun	hanasaki2	that would be a good place to start resolving the issue
2006-11-06T08:17:00.000Z	hanasaki2	crimsun	 cant do that.. the install messed up the box.. no gnome or X or firefox

2006-11-06T08:29:00.000Z	crimsun	hanasaki2	by default, yes. It should be fixed soon. Please don't address further questions regarding it to me, as I can't upload a fixed version yet.
