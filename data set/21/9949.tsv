2005-06-10T14:47:00.000Z	gverig		Can somebody please point me to a good article on Window Managers? KDE and GNOME and desktops. KDE has kwm, GNOME has ... (?). Can KDE be used with a different manager or will is not be KDE any longer? Same for GNOME. What is the difference between WMs? Within GNOME you can customize panels and window dressings. What is different about different WMs besides what can be controlled by themes?
2005-06-10T14:49:00.000Z	linukso	gverig	your asking a big question :)
2005-06-10T14:49:00.000Z	gverig	linukso	I know. I am big...
2005-06-10T14:50:00.000Z	gverig	linukso	I tried RTFM but can't find much
2005-06-10T14:50:00.000Z	linukso	gverig	but this is a gret site: http://xwinman.org/
2005-06-10T14:51:00.000Z	gverig	linukso	I understand what GNOME and KDE are (I think). They include libraries for interfacing with X (Qt and GTK) and sets of tools (like arts vs. ESD, etc)
2005-06-10T14:51:00.000Z	linukso	gverig	gives you an overview of most wm available for X.
2005-06-10T14:51:00.000Z	gverig	linukso	I found this one. It does not answer my question though, what is the difference? I mean there are screenshots...
2005-06-10T14:52:00.000Z	gverig	linukso	And there are themes for each WM (that don't work on other WMs)
2005-06-10T14:53:00.000Z	linukso	gverig	most wm's have their own unike themes
2005-06-10T14:53:00.000Z	gverig	linukso	Right. But do I choose WM just by the themes I like?!
2005-06-10T14:53:00.000Z	linukso	gverig	but *box wm's are (sometimes) compatible
2005-06-10T14:56:00.000Z	linukso	gverig	you can use gnome or kde with different wm's, if you really want to...
2005-06-10T14:56:00.000Z	gverig	linukso	I got that. What I don't understand is why would I want to :) Just for themes?
2005-06-10T14:58:00.000Z	linukso	gverig	Ok, some want themes, some want features, some want to be cool.... many reasons to switch wm.
2005-06-10T14:58:00.000Z	linukso	gverig	kde =kwin, gnome=metacit
2005-06-10T14:58:00.000Z	gverig	linukso	I don't think I want themes. What features are different?
2005-06-10T15:02:00.000Z	linukso	gverig	unless you have a reason to swich wm, I wouldn't bother...
2005-06-10T15:03:00.000Z	gverig	linukso	Well, I want to understand what I am working with
2005-06-10T15:03:00.000Z	gverig	linukso	Despite sounding like a complete newb I do have some exp and I want to have more
2005-06-10T15:11:00.000Z	linukso	gverig	wm are as diffent as cars: looks, handling, performance, image, everything
