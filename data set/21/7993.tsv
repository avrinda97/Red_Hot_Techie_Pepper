2007-05-16T05:07:00.000Z	funkmaster	joycetick	i would suggest to use vmplayer
2007-05-16T05:08:00.000Z	joycetick	funkmaster	i installed that, but i got the idea that i would need to re-install windows xp
2007-05-16T05:08:00.000Z	funkmaster		nope
2007-05-16T05:08:00.000Z	funkmaster		u should not need to i believe
2007-05-16T05:08:00.000Z	joycetick		when it opens all it asks me for is a .vmx file
2007-05-16T05:09:00.000Z	joycetick		i can browse my machine or quit
2007-05-16T05:09:00.000Z	funkmaster		but reinstalling it in vmware has its advantages, first of all that u will have a clean new system of course
2007-05-16T05:09:00.000Z	funkmaster		u can just bridge ur network connections
2007-05-16T05:09:00.000Z	funkmaster		and they will work in the vmplayer as well
2007-05-16T05:10:00.000Z	funkmaster		yes u need to create a vmx file
2007-05-16T05:10:00.000Z	funkmaster		u can select in vmware to look for an windows install
2007-05-16T05:10:00.000Z	funkmaster		it should create necessary files
2007-05-16T05:11:00.000Z	funkmaster		tarelrulz: vmplayer is not a mediaplayer
2007-05-16T05:11:00.000Z	joycetick		umm, what does network connections have to do with this? lol, and i think il just keep my xp if i cant do it
2007-05-16T05:11:00.000Z	funkmaster		it belongs to vmware
2007-05-16T05:11:00.000Z	funkmaster		virtual manager
2007-05-16T05:11:00.000Z	funkmaster		commercial OS emulator
2007-05-16T05:11:00.000Z	funkmaster		but vmplayer is for free
2007-05-16T05:12:00.000Z	joycetick	funkmaster	do i need to install vmware server or something along with player?
