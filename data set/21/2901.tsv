2010-03-27T13:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LinuxGuy2009	 you proberly want a fstab entry so the thing gets mountd at boot time.
2010-03-27T13:13:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	Dr_Willis	Ok well the reason I asked is because I wont have the drive plugged in all the time. Only be plugged in right before i install something offline.
2010-03-27T13:14:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	Dr_Willis	So you would say an fstab entry is needed?
2010-05-02T13:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LinuxGuy2009	  theres proberly a tweak - since thats what the other tweaking tools are basically doing.
2010-05-02T13:17:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	Dr_Willis	Right thats what i figured
2010-05-02T13:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LinuxGuy2009	 proberly some gconf-XXXXXX type command can do it.
2010-05-02T13:17:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	Dr_Willis	yeah
2010-05-16T17:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LinuxGuy2009	 theres a file size limit i think for generating thumbnails what can differ if its on a local or remote filesystem. F5 refreshes the dir.
2010-05-16T17:57:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	Dr_Willis	Yeah i checked that and I cranked it up to 4GB file size limit and didnt help. Only movie that wont show a preview is my ripped Avatar DVD that I made with HandBrake. No idea why. If I rename the file or extension then it draws one, but as soon as I name it back to Avatar.mp4 it goes back to the basic video icon again. Think this may be a bug or something?
2010-05-22T21:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LinuxGuy2009	 try some other live cds see if it affexts other ubuntu variants?
2010-05-22T21:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LinuxGuy2009	 yea. it could be some video driver quirk also
2010-08-08T13:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LinuxGuy2009	 not that i have ever seen or heard of.
2010-08-08T13:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LinuxGuy2009	 and i see tht asked (or similer questions asked) in here about once a week.  like 3 times today even.
2010-08-21T17:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LinuxGuy2009	 I think you can do LTS => LTS  or you have to go from one release to the next... not  'any' to the latest.
2010-08-21T17:55:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	Dr_Willis	Ok I just wanted to check. Thanks.
2010-08-22T07:03:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	Dr_Willis	5 DVD repo disks and the sixth one is the 5.0.5 update DVD.
2010-08-22T06:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LinuxGuy2009	 i dont think it works that way. You can define a mount point based on UUID then use the mountpoint perhaps.
2010-08-22T06:58:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	Dr_Willis	My USB hard drives UUID=ef3fd978-a56f-462a-a452-93fcae1bdb86. So can I use that in the sources.list entry so it knows which external drive to use?
2010-08-22T07:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LinuxGuy2009	 you MOUNT the drive to some location. then you can somehow add the location to your sources I belive.  you DONT use the uuid in the sources.list
2010-08-22T07:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LinuxGuy2009	 how much stuff is on the hd? You could just copy all the debs to /var/cache/apt/archives/
2010-08-22T07:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LinuxGuy2009	 so these are Opticel/dvd disks not a hard drive then? I would suggest checking out some guides on making your own repository then.
