2008-01-24T16:24:00.000Z	mikebeecham		can someone help me with launcher commands.  I am trying to run play/pause buttons on a panel.  The help document told me the command would be "listen --play-pause"...but this does not work, and I get an error message?

2008-01-24T16:27:00.000Z	mikebeecham	bod_	I have downloaded a gtk theme set...within that set were some media buttons to put on a panel that will control your player, in this case rhythmbox..I am trying to get these to work
2008-01-24T16:27:00.000Z	bod_	mikebeecham	are you trying to pause ur music from the terminal,. those commands work as default for any program with a play/pause button
2008-01-24T16:29:00.000Z	bod_	mikebeecham	so the buttons dont work?
2008-01-24T16:29:00.000Z	mikebeecham	bod_	 no
2008-01-24T16:30:00.000Z	bod_	mikebeecham	sorry,.,. not sure how to make non-working buttons work
2008-01-30T20:44:00.000Z	bod_	mikebeecham	thats quite a handfull ur trying to do there,. i dunno what an XBMC is though
2008-01-30T20:44:00.000Z	mikebeecham	bod_	it's the xbox media center
2008-01-30T20:44:00.000Z	bod_	mikebeecham	so you want to send a microsft format to linix and vice versa?
2008-01-30T20:45:00.000Z	mikebeecham	bod_	if thats the description, then yes!
2008-01-30T20:45:00.000Z	bod_	mikebeecham	which art of that are you having problems with?
2008-01-30T20:46:00.000Z	mikebeecham	bod_	within xbox, I have set it to search for the linux smb shares....so when I am on linux I can stream fine
2008-01-30T20:46:00.000Z	mikebeecham	bod_	 however, when I have booted into windows, the xbox can no longer see the linux shares and does not work
2008-01-30T20:46:00.000Z	bod_	mikebeecham	you mean booted into windows on the xbox?
2008-01-30T20:47:00.000Z	mikebeecham	bod_	on the PC
2008-01-30T20:47:00.000Z	bod_	mikebeecham	and linux on the xbox?
2008-01-30T20:47:00.000Z	bod_	mikebeecham	you need to have the linux files on the windows aswell
2008-01-30T20:48:00.000Z	bod_	mikebeecham	so just set up so windows can see the files on the linux hard drive?
2008-01-30T20:49:00.000Z	bod_	mikebeecham	your overcomplicating things,. just share both of the folders so you can see everything from linux and windows,. fix 1 problem at a time,.,. remove the xbox from the equation untill you have the sharing sorted
