2011-05-04T22:36:00.000Z	mang0		yes I know, !ask...
2011-05-04T22:38:00.000Z	mang0		So 11.04 has better support for drivers then 10.10?
2011-05-04T22:39:00.000Z	ThinkT510	mang0	11.04 uses a newer kernel than 10.10 so there are driver updates and whatnot
2011-07-29T11:35:00.000Z	mang0	ThinkT510	what was the command?
2011-07-29T11:35:00.000Z	ThinkT510	mang0	to remove root
2012-07-30T16:49:00.000Z	ThinkT510	mang0	have you unplugged it since you formatted?
2012-07-30T16:51:00.000Z	mang0	ThinkT510	Yes
2012-07-30T17:04:00.000Z	mang0	ThinkT510	Not quite; I've already tried using UNetbootin, but it didn't work, so therefore I want to try a different method that requires me to have an empty FAT32/NTFS stick
2012-07-30T17:05:00.000Z	mang0	ThinkT510	------__^
2012-07-30T17:06:00.000Z	ThinkT510	mang0	i've formatted plenty of usb sticks to fat32 and have never got that error
2012-07-30T17:07:00.000Z	mang0	ThinkT510	:/ well, I'm going to reboot, I'll check back in a second.
2012-07-30T17:18:00.000Z	ThinkT510	mang0	you didn't have gparted still open while you were trying to format did you?
2012-07-30T17:18:00.000Z	mang0	ThinkT510	Huh? I wasn't using terminal
2012-07-30T17:19:00.000Z	ThinkT510	mang0	sorry, gparted open while trying to mount i meant
2012-07-30T17:19:00.000Z	mang0	ThinkT510	O-oh...would that have made a difference?
2012-07-30T17:19:00.000Z	ThinkT510	mang0	yeah
