2012-08-01T00:41:00.000Z	Relondo		Why does Ubuntu pop up with a message sometimes saying that "Your login keyring was not unlocked. Enter your password."
2012-08-01T00:41:00.000Z	Relondo		?
2012-08-01T00:41:00.000Z	Relondo		Sarbull: Did this ever happen with Windows?
2012-08-01T00:42:00.000Z	Relondo		Sarbull: Because the M11x is just sorta notorious for overheating.
2012-08-01T00:44:00.000Z	Relondo		Sarbull: Do you think it's overheating because you feel heat, or because you are using a heat monitor? Also, did this ever happen with Windows?
2012-08-01T00:45:00.000Z	Relondo		Sarbull: Because if you just feel it near the fan, that just means that the fan is working.
2012-08-01T00:46:00.000Z	Relondo		Sarbull: My laptop is always warm near the fan. But the rest of it is fine. It's just the fan doing its job.
2012-08-01T00:46:00.000Z	sarbull	Relondo	the proccesor is fine, around 40 degrees, the nvidia chipset is the problem, it should be turned off ..
2012-08-01T00:46:00.000Z	Relondo	sarbull	Alright.
2012-08-01T00:46:00.000Z	sarbull	Relondo	how can i disable a hardware component?
2012-08-01T00:48:00.000Z	sarbull	Relondo	in the bios, there are only two options: ON and "the opportunity for turning it on by some keyboard combinations" FN+F6 in windows ..
2012-08-01T00:49:00.000Z	sarbull	Relondo	interesting link, i'm reading it right now
2012-08-01T00:50:00.000Z	sarbull	Relondo	i used that option, the battery drops to 1:30 hours and the resolution changes to 1024x768, BAD!
2012-08-01T00:53:00.000Z	sarbull	Relondo	m11x have two video, nvidia and vga, now i'm working on the vga .. but the nvidia is heated up .. so i guess that's the problem..
2012-08-01T00:54:00.000Z	Relondo	sarbull	And turning the Nvidia off ruins your resolution.
2012-08-01T00:55:00.000Z	sarbull	Relondo	turning it on from the bios, i dont know if the nvidia is turned on right now, on windows, when i turn off the nvidia, the system is cool enough for no worries, but when i turn nvidia back on, on windows it heats up ..
2012-08-01T00:56:00.000Z	sarbull	Relondo	now i am on ubuntu, and i think it is turned on but not using it ..
2012-08-01T00:56:00.000Z	Relondo	sarbull	So the problem here is that the nvidia overheats even when not in use?
2012-08-01T01:36:00.000Z	sarbull	Relondo	i used blacklist nouveu, blacklist nv, blacklist nvidia
2012-08-01T01:37:00.000Z	sarbull	Relondo	now i have another problem, the screen went down to 640 by 480 pixels and the screen is 4:3
2012-08-01T01:37:00.000Z	sarbull	Relondo	the thing is that the ubuntu logo at start up is full screen at 1366x768, dafuq dude?
