2012-06-08T12:25:00.000Z	weiyang		hi, all I am using ubuntu 11.04,
2012-06-08T12:25:00.000Z	weiyang		and want to configure the console
2012-06-08T12:26:00.000Z	weiyang		I looked at the page http://www.debuntu.org/how-to-set-up-a-serial-console-on-ubuntu
2012-06-08T12:26:00.000Z	weiyang		after that, I can see the output from this port
2012-06-08T12:26:00.000Z	weiyang		but I can't get a shell prompt from this port
2012-06-08T12:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	weiyang	 you  ran a login command to use the port?
2012-06-08T12:30:00.000Z	weiyang	Dr_Willis	 hmm... i try to login through serial port
2012-06-08T12:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	weiyang	 so you get a Login: promot at the serial terminal?
2012-06-08T12:31:00.000Z	weiyang	Dr_Willis	no, i don't get
2012-06-08T12:31:00.000Z	weiyang	Dr_Willis	while i get output
2012-06-08T12:37:00.000Z	weiyang	Dr_Willis	let me have a try
2012-06-08T12:39:00.000Z	weiyang	Dr_Willis	wow, works
2012-06-08T12:40:00.000Z	weiyang	Dr_Willis	 thanks :)
2012-06-08T12:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	weiyang	 you have to start the  service to get the login. :)
2012-06-08T12:41:00.000Z	weiyang	Dr_Willis	so /etc/event.d/ttyS0.conf, just defines the event?
2012-06-08T12:42:00.000Z	weiyang	Dr_Willis	while I also think this script does something
2012-06-08T12:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	weiyang	 no idea. ive not messed with  upstart or services in ages
2012-06-08T12:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	weiyang	 i wiould think there would be a  /etc/init/tty1.conf type file for theserial terinal
2012-06-08T12:44:00.000Z	weiyang	Dr_Willis	 do you think upstart is not easy to use?
2012-06-08T12:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	weiyang	 i rarely need to  mess with it
2012-06-08T12:45:00.000Z	weiyang	Dr_Willis	:)
