2008-07-26T06:35:00.000Z	gaelfx_	usr13	well, I'm not sure because I'm connected through my school, and normally I can upload at at least 90/100, but it's more like 10/20
2008-07-26T06:38:00.000Z	usr13	gaelfx_	YOu could use tcptump to see if there is more traffic than you realize.

2008-07-26T06:50:00.000Z	usr13	gaelfx_	see:  man tcpdump
