2006-08-28T06:53:00.000Z	Cillian		I just installed ubuntu using the custom debootstrap method, and when I login through gdm, it sits there with a blank brown screen for about 4 minutes before gnome starts loading
2006-08-28T06:53:00.000Z	Cillian		Anybody know whats up?
2006-08-28T06:53:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Cillian	what hardware are you running?
2006-08-28T06:54:00.000Z	Cillian	Jack_Sparrow	Intel pentium M, 900MHz, 512 megs ram, though I had an identical problem when I installed with the same method on my faster workstation
2006-08-28T06:54:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Cillian	The normal install didnt work for you?
2006-08-28T06:54:00.000Z	Cillian	Jack_Sparrow	I don't have any 700 meg CDs to burn the full install CDs onto :/
2006-08-28T06:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Cillian	have you tried regular cd's
2006-08-28T06:55:00.000Z	Cillian	Jack_Sparrow	Hmm?
2006-08-28T06:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Cillian	I know the image is larger than that.. but part of that is because it is an image
2006-08-28T06:56:00.000Z	Cillian	Jack_Sparrow	Err, so I could try burning a 700 meg image onto a 650 disc and hopefully the bit it misses off the end isn't important...?
2006-08-28T06:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Cillian	It may not miss anything
2006-08-28T06:56:00.000Z	Cillian	Jack_Sparrow	Err... ok, I'll try it.
2006-08-28T06:59:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Cillian	IF that does not work .. get a 700meg cd.  Around here they are at every grocery store and 7-11
2006-08-28T06:59:00.000Z	Cillian	Jack_Sparrow	:/, ok...
2006-08-28T07:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Cillian	It will stillnot be fast on a 900mhz box (and probably slow ide drives as well)
2006-08-28T07:01:00.000Z	Cillian	Jack_Sparrow	But 4 minutes of doing nothing?  And the exact same thing on a much faster Athlon 3200+
2006-08-28T07:01:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Cillian	It isnt doing nothing... it is setting up the system
2006-08-28T07:01:00.000Z	Cillian	Jack_Sparrow	Are you sure?  This is before it even pops up the gnome loading bit
2006-08-28T07:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Cillian	Start with the standard install and go from there
2006-08-28T07:02:00.000Z	Cillian	Jack_Sparrow	Ok...
2006-08-28T07:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Cillian	There may be a timer waiting for input etc..
