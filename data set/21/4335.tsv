2008-06-22T17:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hiptobecubic	 i dont belive there is any special 'file' i do seem to recall some commands ages and ages ago that could make them blink and stuff.
2008-06-22T17:59:00.000Z	hiptobecubic	Dr_Willis	that's kind of what i'm looking for. any ideas?
2008-06-22T18:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hiptobecubic	 not really.. been 10+ yrs since i last saw anyone care about that stuff
2008-06-22T18:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hiptobecubic	 you want the caps lock to blink out morse code? :)
2008-06-22T18:01:00.000Z	hiptobecubic	Dr_Willis	haha great. No i'm looking to make it indicate something useful, like mail
2008-06-22T18:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hiptobecubic	 one of those usb lcd screens are handy. :) like the one in my G15 keyboard
2008-06-22T18:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hiptobecubic	 http://paranoidlinux.org/content/package-selection-meeting-part-1 mentions somthing on caps lock blinking morse code
2008-06-22T18:02:00.000Z	hiptobecubic	Dr_Willis	thanks looking now.
2008-06-22T18:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hiptobecubic	 it dosent say much more then 'i saw a program that did this...' :)
2008-06-22T18:05:00.000Z	hiptobecubic	Dr_Willis	hah yes i just saw it
2008-06-22T18:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hiptobecubic	 http://www.nongnu.org/blinkd/blink.html
2008-06-22T18:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hiptobecubic	 check out blinkd in the repos :)
2008-06-22T18:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hiptobecubic	  blink -n -r 10    - now i got a flashy led...
2008-06-22T18:14:00.000Z	hiptobecubic	Dr_Willis	where is says -r "no reopen console, what does that mean?"
2008-06-22T18:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hiptobecubic	 No idea on that.. its working here fine.. -> blink -s -r 5 && blink -c -r 4 && blink -n -r 10
2008-06-22T18:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hiptobecubic	 the blink man pages state n - numlock, s = scroll lock, c = capslock
2008-06-22T18:22:00.000Z	hiptobecubic	Dr_Willis	my keyboard and mouse went nuts. pc speaker started screeching. i guess i can live without blinky lights lol
