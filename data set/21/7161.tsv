2008-02-15T04:52:00.000Z	MatBoy		do I need the alternated CD for a Software raid install ?
2008-02-15T04:52:00.000Z	Slart	MatBoy	probably.. never seen an option concerning raid on the live install
2008-02-15T04:53:00.000Z	MatBoy	Slart	me neither... astro76 thanks !
2008-02-15T04:54:00.000Z	Slart	MatBoy	4 monitors? anything that works.. =)
2009-01-17T03:18:00.000Z	Slart	MatBoy	you need to specify what application you're using for that vm..
2009-01-17T03:19:00.000Z	MatBoy	Slart	nope I don't because itś in ubuntu, in the z24_persisten-net.rules
2009-01-17T03:21:00.000Z	Slart	MatBoy	if you clone it in using the vm tools you might be able to change the mac address from there.. it is part of the hardware that the vm "emulates"..
2009-01-17T03:24:00.000Z	MatBoy	Slart	yep, but the mac it seen in dmesg, so thatś why I thought... maybe I can automaticly replace it
2009-01-17T03:24:00.000Z	Slart	MatBoy	I think you can replace the mac address.. I've never done it myself but I've read about it a few times.. not really sure where to look though
2009-01-17T03:25:00.000Z	Slart	MatBoy	I still think it's far easier to do it in the vm management software
2009-01-17T03:25:00.000Z	MatBoy	Slart	I think not because Ubuntu has to change it... not the vm management software
2009-01-17T03:27:00.000Z	Slart	MatBoy	well.. I'm looking at my virtualbox manager right now and amongst the other settings for the vm I can set the MAC address for the network card.. or use a random one..
2009-01-17T03:27:00.000Z	MatBoy	Slart	indeed, but you don't want to the same one every time when you clone :)
2009-01-17T03:29:00.000Z	Slart	MatBoy	nope.. so I'll just generate a new one for each new clone.. how many vm's are you going to use?
2009-01-17T03:29:00.000Z	MatBoy	Slart	yes, but it seems that Ubuntu doesn't change the mac in the 70 file automaticly !!
2009-01-17T05:04:00.000Z	Slart	MatBoy	I think root can set passwords without having to type the old one
2009-01-17T05:04:00.000Z	Slart	MatBoy	check man passwd
2009-01-17T05:05:00.000Z	MatBoy	Slart	yes, without the old one, but I don't want to type the new ones twice
2009-01-17T05:05:00.000Z	Slart	MatBoy	then make a script that enters it twice ... call it lazy_passwd =)
2009-01-17T05:06:00.000Z	MatBoy	Slart	mhh, I can try that it echo's it twice
2009-06-18T16:23:00.000Z	Slart	MatBoy	I think what you're doing is called a "watchdog".. there has to be a tool for this in the repos.. but yes.. checking ps output might work
