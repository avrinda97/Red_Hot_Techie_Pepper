2007-11-23T08:05:00.000Z	thinsoldier		where are the files I see when I access http://localhost
2007-11-23T08:06:00.000Z	thinsoldier		is there a "Find" feature in ubuntu?
2007-11-23T08:06:00.000Z	macd	thinsoldier	load up a console, and type 'man find', or use desktop search.
2007-11-23T08:07:00.000Z	macd	thinsoldier	right click on your panel at the top, and hit add applet, then add it.
2007-11-23T08:07:00.000Z	macd	thinsoldier	its called "Search for files"
2007-11-23T08:09:00.000Z	macd	thinsoldier	sure
2007-11-23T08:09:00.000Z	thinsoldier	macd	I have no idea where to put files so they show up on http://localhost
2007-11-23T08:10:00.000Z	macd	thinsoldier	/var/www/apache2-default
2007-11-23T08:11:00.000Z	thinsoldier	macd	why can't I save files in /var/www/apache2-default ?
2007-11-23T08:12:00.000Z	macd	thinsoldier	b/c you need to be 'sudo'
2007-11-23T08:18:00.000Z	macd	thinsoldier	either gnome-system-monitor, or 'top' in a console
2007-11-23T08:19:00.000Z	macd	thinsoldier	what are you trying to kill or restart?
2007-11-23T08:19:00.000Z	macd	thinsoldier	dont kill apache like that!  use the init script 'sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 stop'
2007-11-23T08:19:00.000Z	macd	thinsoldier	its also not called apache in the proc list, its called "httpd"
2007-11-23T08:19:00.000Z	thinsoldier	macd	how can I make a shortcut that runs that command?
2007-11-23T08:20:00.000Z	macd	thinsoldier	put it in a bash script, then make a shortcut on your desktop
2007-11-23T08:20:00.000Z	macd	thinsoldier	then its not running
2007-11-23T08:22:00.000Z	macd	thinsoldier	.sh, then "chmod u+x script.sh"
2007-11-23T08:26:00.000Z	macd	thinsoldier	you should look at the apache logs in /var/log/apache2/
2007-11-23T08:28:00.000Z	thinsoldier	macd	thanks, had the folder on my desktop instead of my home
