2007-03-02T14:19:00.000Z	darkcommon	NET||abuse	change the partition to 512mb, with 2gig you have much, its sufficent
2007-03-02T14:20:00.000Z	NET||abuse	darkcommon	one thing i've had happen is that i coppied over 1600 mp3's from my desktop machine, and put into my Music folder, Amarok monitors that directory, so when i start up Amarok, it tries to update the collection with the new files in the library,, so it starts it's task, and quickly the memory graph steps up and up to 98% used by programs, 2% used by cache, and cpu start climbing to 100%
2007-03-02T14:21:00.000Z	darkcommon	NET||abuse	do more swap, if you want, 3gig
2007-03-02T14:22:00.000Z	NET||abuse	darkcommon	well, i've used my whole remaining 160GB drive for the / partition of ubuntu, so i would have to resize down / partition (/dev/hda2) and resize the swap parition up with that freed space,, is that a big deal to do with live data on my machine?
2007-03-02T14:22:00.000Z	darkcommon	NET||abuse	what CPU you have
2007-03-02T14:22:00.000Z	NET||abuse	darkcommon	obviously i would have to boot into some tool like gparted or some such
2007-03-02T14:22:00.000Z	darkcommon	NET||abuse	yep
2007-03-02T14:23:00.000Z	NET||abuse	darkcommon	oh, it's a laptop, compaq nc6000, the cpu is just a Pentium(m)
2007-03-02T14:24:00.000Z	NET||abuse	darkcommon	is my cpu ok then?
2007-03-02T14:24:00.000Z	darkcommon	NET||abuse	if the CPU climb to 100% and the CPU is hot, Ubuntu restart, dont problem
