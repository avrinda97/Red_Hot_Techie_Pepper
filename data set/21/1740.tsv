2010-05-11T23:07:00.000Z	Sweet		Hi, I'm having a problem that really needs to be fixed... I have no input from my mic on my Intel HDA sound card using coded Realtek ALC275, G45 DEVIBX
2010-05-11T23:07:00.000Z	Sweet		I've tried everything and I'm looking for a workaround, anything will do...
2010-05-11T23:08:00.000Z	Sweet		I'm running latest build of ubuntu lucid on a Sony Vaio VPC11X9E btw
2010-05-11T23:08:00.000Z	erpingham	Sweet	I had a similar problem.
2010-05-11T23:08:00.000Z	erpingham	Sweet	try plugging your mic into the line in and using that input.
2010-05-11T23:09:00.000Z	Sweet	erpingham	doesn't work... as I said I tried everything
2010-05-11T23:09:00.000Z	Sweet	erpingham	I'm getting desperate even :5
2010-05-11T23:09:00.000Z	Sweet		:(
2010-05-11T23:09:00.000Z	erpingham	Sweet	incidentally, what have you used to test it? Audacity or the ubuntu sound recorder app?
2010-05-11T23:10:00.000Z	erpingham		I've found that the sound recorder app is unreliable.
2010-05-11T23:10:00.000Z	Sweet	erpingham	I've tried skype echo service and the sound config panel
2010-05-11T23:10:00.000Z	erpingham	Sweet	okay, in skype, go into the settings and uncheck the box "let skype manage my volume levels"
2010-05-11T23:11:00.000Z	erpingham	Sweet	"Options" then "Sound devices" then uncheck "allow skype to automatically adjust my mixer levels"
2010-05-11T23:12:00.000Z	Sweet	erpingham	doesn't work
2010-05-11T23:12:00.000Z	erpingham	Sweet	ok, then I don't know what next.
2010-05-11T23:12:00.000Z	Sweet	erpingham	tried internal mic and line in with external mic
2010-05-11T23:13:00.000Z	erpingham	Sweet	though I would recommending trying to record something with Audacity as a way of testing
2010-05-11T23:13:00.000Z	Sweet	erpingham	thx for the help, however I need to be making an urgent call so SKype has to work! :p
2010-05-11T23:14:00.000Z	erpingham	Sweet	I guess I wasn't much help.
2010-05-11T23:14:00.000Z	Sweet		I have no input from my mic on my Intel HDA sound card using coded Realtek ALC275, G45 DEVIBX, need a workaround anybody????
2010-05-11T23:14:00.000Z	Sweet	erpingham	thx for trying!
