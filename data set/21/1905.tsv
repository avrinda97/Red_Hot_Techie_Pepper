2010-04-09T10:56:00.000Z	MailGon		how do I remove ubuntu partition from a netbook?
2010-04-09T10:56:00.000Z	MailGon		is there a partition manager in ubuntu?
2010-04-09T10:58:00.000Z	MailGon		Well it has gparted on it, but is it a good idea to remove Ubuntu? I mean its the only OS on my netbook
2010-04-09T10:58:00.000Z	MailGon		im not dualbooting
2010-04-09T10:58:00.000Z	MailGon		its ok to format the OS im currently using?
2010-04-09T10:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MailGon	you want to get rid of Ubuntu on a net book?
2010-04-09T10:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MailGon	Why?
2010-04-09T11:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MailGon	if you got a real netbook, Windows is quite pointless on it, for example can you 3D game nope?   I say pointless since other OS's such as Ubuntu will work, and are more secure
2010-04-09T11:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MailGon	You can maybe with Ubuntu though.  It's just delete the partiton for Ubuntu and install Windows.  However some of us are wondering why you want to do that.
2010-04-09T11:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MailGon	yes the Windows installer won't detect Linux partitions properly
2010-04-09T11:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MailGon	you need something you can run gparted from really,  so that's your answer.  Altough I don't understand why you want Windows on there in the first place.
2010-04-09T11:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MailGon	or make a presistent USB flash drive and use that
2010-04-09T11:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MailGon	which apps do you want to run?
2010-04-09T11:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MailGon	by the way net books are only meatn to be basic computers, for web browsing, a bit of typing and that's about it
2010-04-09T11:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MailGon	all the basic net book tasks, the actsual tasks, you can do in Ubuntu
2010-04-09T11:05:00.000Z	MailGon	sebsebseb	I use my netbook for development purposes, some of my tools do not run on linux
2010-04-09T11:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MailGon	Micrsooft development tools?
2010-04-09T11:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MailGon	anyway hrm net books, you probably got hardly any RAM, and hardly any space,  so  Windows virtual machine is probably out.
2010-04-09T11:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MailGon	web cam you can probably configure.  also there are other Linux distributions that might be better on that netbook.
2010-04-09T11:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MailGon	also that USB stick you could then use on better computers and have some fun with Ubuntu
2010-04-09T11:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MailGon	yes there are differences here and there between  Windows and Linux distributions, but if you give a distro a proper chance, and learn/read a bit about it, you will probably like it.  Also depending to some extent on the hardware you want to use with it of course.  If it just works or not.
