2011-08-27T13:02:00.000Z	Guybrush_T		can somebody help me with a question i have concerning raid and fstab
2011-08-27T13:03:00.000Z	Guybrush_T		ok then
2011-08-27T13:04:00.000Z	Guybrush_T		i have 2 raids created during ubuntu installation : raid 1 with 2 hds with / on it and a raid5 mounted on /data
2011-08-27T13:04:00.000Z	Guybrush_T		now the fstab looks like this
2011-08-27T13:04:00.000Z	Guybrush_T		http://pastebin.com/42TezPAB
2011-08-27T13:05:00.000Z	Guybrush_T		i noticed that the raid5 apparantly was mounted with the uuid
2011-08-27T13:06:00.000Z	Guybrush_T		but the other one not
2011-08-27T13:06:00.000Z	Guybrush_T		ah ok - im sorry
2011-08-27T13:06:00.000Z	Guybrush_T		im done though so : next time
2011-08-27T13:07:00.000Z	SwedeMike	Guybrush_T	you forgot to ask the question or describe what the problem was.
2011-08-27T13:08:00.000Z	Guybrush_T		Is the /dev/mapper/System-os / in fstab really my raid, or maybe just sda? Because the way my raids got mounted are so different and i dont understand why.
2011-08-27T13:09:00.000Z	SwedeMike	Guybrush_T	what does your crypttab look like?
2011-08-27T13:09:00.000Z	Guybrush_T	SwedeMike	sorry never heard of that
2011-08-27T13:10:00.000Z	SwedeMike	Guybrush_T	oki, I thought the /dev/mapper ones was due to encryption.
2011-08-27T13:11:00.000Z	Guybrush_T		ah no encryption  i only encrypt on my notebook
2011-08-27T13:11:00.000Z	Guybrush_T	SwedeMike	i just google crypttab - should i still post it?
2011-08-27T13:12:00.000Z	SwedeMike	Guybrush_T	if you don't use encryption then there is no need. I'm trying to think of an easy to way to figure out what kind of device /dev/mapper/System-os is, but I'm drawing a blank.
2011-08-27T13:12:00.000Z	Guybrush_T		Basically what i want to find out is if bhing the /dev/mapper/system-os
2011-08-27T13:12:00.000Z	Guybrush_T	SwedeMike	Right - this is exactly what i wanted to ask - how to check WHAT system-os is
2011-08-27T13:15:00.000Z	Guybrush_T	SwedeMike	i just used dmsetup described here : http://askubuntu.com/questions/22548/how-do-i-know-what-physical-drives-partitions-are-behind-my-dev-mapper-isw-dghbb
