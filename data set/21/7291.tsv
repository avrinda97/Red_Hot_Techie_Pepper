2006-10-27T15:18:00.000Z	Kannix		Ok here it goes again. I am trying to install ubuntu 6.10 and I get stuck at the mount point preparation. I have three partitions, one Windows, one swap and one ext3. I chose the ext3 to be the root partition. However, I get the "no root filesystem" error!
2006-10-27T15:18:00.000Z	Kannix		What am I doing wrong?
2006-10-27T15:19:00.000Z	budluva	Kannix	i had that problem today
2006-10-27T15:19:00.000Z	Kannix	budluva	How did you solve it?
2006-10-27T15:20:00.000Z	budluva	Kannix	when you get step 4/6 i think, where you can delete/move/resize your partitions....you must delete and recreate your / partition, there is a bug that wont allow the partitioner to install over a previous ext3 partition, thus deleting and creating a new one fixes the problem
2006-10-27T15:20:00.000Z	Kannix	budluva	ok, will try. One moment pls
