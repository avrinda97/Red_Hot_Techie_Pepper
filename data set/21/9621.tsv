2005-10-02T15:24:00.000Z	Chousuke		a little :P
2005-10-02T15:24:00.000Z	Chousuke		It doesn't necessarily support as many programs though.
2005-10-02T15:24:00.000Z	Chousuke		especially games.
2005-10-02T15:24:00.000Z	Chousuke		but for the programs it supports, it supports them better than wine.
2005-10-02T15:25:00.000Z	Chousuke		Depends on which games you play.
2005-10-02T15:25:00.000Z	Chousuke		Older games work fine with wine.
2005-10-02T15:25:00.000Z	Chousuke		no need.
2005-10-02T15:25:00.000Z	Chousuke		you don't need the binary drivers.
2005-10-02T15:25:00.000Z	Chousuke		you already have 3d
2005-10-02T15:25:00.000Z	Chousuke		no.
2005-10-02T15:26:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Chousuke	My glxgears output shows 286FPS
2005-10-02T15:26:00.000Z	Chousuke	onkarshinde	are you using the radeon driver on X?
2005-10-02T15:27:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Chousuke	I havern't installed any extra package yet. I just added this card to my existing system and did a dpkg-reconfigure
2005-10-02T15:27:00.000Z	Chousuke	onkarshinde	you need none.
2005-10-02T15:27:00.000Z	Chousuke	onkarshinde	just select the radeon driver for X
2005-10-02T15:27:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Chousuke	Then why 286 FPS?
2005-10-18T14:56:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Chousuke	Quite long
2005-12-19T06:46:00.000Z	Chousuke	onkarshinde	it's not possible to improve quality.
2005-12-19T06:47:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Chousuke	what tricks?
2005-12-19T06:47:00.000Z	Chousuke	onkarshinde	like filters.
2005-12-19T06:47:00.000Z	Chousuke	onkarshinde	don't ask me
