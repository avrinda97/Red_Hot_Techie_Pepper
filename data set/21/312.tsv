2012-03-22T11:48:00.000Z	lizzin		i am attempting to use usb-creator-gtk to make a bootable usb. but it keeps failing with
2012-03-22T11:48:00.000Z	lizzin		"there is not enough free space for this image"
2012-03-22T11:48:00.000Z	lizzin		the usb stick is 8gb. why is this happening?
2012-03-22T11:49:00.000Z	MestreLion	lizzin	is the usb full?
2012-03-22T11:50:00.000Z	lizzin	MestreLion	i don't believe so. i just use disk utiltity in osx to reformat it
2012-03-22T11:50:00.000Z	MestreLion	lizzin	what filesystem did it create?
2012-03-22T11:52:00.000Z	MestreLion	lizzin	using MSDOS "traditional" partition table?
2012-03-22T11:52:00.000Z	lizzin	MestreLion	i'm not sure. what do you suggest i use?
2012-03-22T11:53:00.000Z	MestreLion	lizzin	I'm blind-guessing here... osx is capable of gpt partition tables, and they may not be supported by usb-creator
2012-03-22T11:53:00.000Z	MestreLion	lizzin	and gpt might be the default format iin Disk Utility
2012-03-22T11:54:00.000Z	MestreLion	lizzin	try "format Drive" again, it should ask what partition table standard to use
2012-03-22T11:54:00.000Z	lizzin	MestreLion	under osx?
2012-03-22T11:54:00.000Z	MestreLion	lizzin	yes... I'm assuming you're using disk utility and usb-creator in osx, correct?
2012-03-22T11:55:00.000Z	lizzin	MestreLion	the options are 'guid pt', 'apple pt' or 'master boot record'
2012-03-22T11:56:00.000Z	MestreLion	lizzin	"master boot record"
2012-03-22T11:56:00.000Z	lizzin	MestreLion	thats what i've been using
2012-03-22T11:57:00.000Z	lizzin	MestreLion	ill try this again
2012-03-22T12:06:00.000Z	lizzin	MestreLion	so im actually using unetbootin under osx
2012-03-22T12:11:00.000Z	lizzin	MestreLion	so it appears to work but returns "the created usb device will not boot off a mac. insert it into a pc and select the usb boot option in the bios menu." is this normal?
2012-03-22T12:12:00.000Z	MestreLion	lizzin	hummm, mac *requires* gpt ?then I don't know man...
2012-03-22T12:16:00.000Z	MestreLion	lizzin	I'm not sure about the requirements for usb-creator in osx, sorry... not even sure IF usb-creator is able to hand non-mbr partition tables...
