2007-01-27T06:27:00.000Z	gably		I need help
2007-01-27T06:27:00.000Z	zoli2k	gably	ask
2007-01-27T06:28:00.000Z	zoli2k	gably	there is no password default
2007-01-27T06:28:00.000Z	zoli2k	gably	you should use "sudo" and to get root terminal sodu -i
2007-01-27T06:28:00.000Z	zoli2k	gably	sudo -i  and your user password will give you a root terminal
2007-01-27T06:29:00.000Z	zoli2k	gably	if you need to set root password give passwd as root.
2007-01-27T06:30:00.000Z	zoli2k	gably	 what you want to do? your problem was that you did not get acces. as root you allready have??? so what is the problem?
2007-01-27T06:31:00.000Z	zoli2k	gably	as root you can not edit?
2007-01-27T06:32:00.000Z	zoli2k	gably	 but you have a root terminal, or not?
2007-01-27T06:32:00.000Z	zoli2k	gably	 no, you think wrong
2007-01-27T06:33:00.000Z	zoli2k	gably	gedit filename
2007-01-27T06:33:00.000Z	zoli2k	gably	 or if you wanna edit a file without root terminal, only write "sude gedit /my_important_file_to_edit".
