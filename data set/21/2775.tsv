2009-12-10T00:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tohuw	could fix future problems then fix future futre problems by working out te relation between the system and the future problems
2009-12-10T00:04:00.000Z	Tohuw	ActionParsnip	sure, but banging one's head against the wall to try and compensate for events that aren't likely to happen can be more a waste of time than a future benefit.
2009-12-10T00:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tohuw	its a discworld reference based on the study of future books being influenced by current books being read
2011-02-05T07:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tohuw	try a reboot
2011-02-05T07:04:00.000Z	Tohuw	ActionParsnip	I did, that's what made it disappear from the list :D I'll try another though
2011-02-05T07:05:00.000Z	Tohuw	ActionParsnip	I should have also mentioned, it can't connect to networks, but I can see the networks. (as opposed to when I first installed the OS and the driver wasn't even present)
2011-02-05T07:09:00.000Z	Tohuw	ActionParsnip	frotzed: now the STA shows up again, but trying to install either yields the message: InstallArchives() failed
2011-10-03T08:45:00.000Z	Tohuw	ActionParsnip	From his dump he posted, looks like XOrg is freaking out over an invalid EDID. But I agree, asking about the RAM can save time!
2011-10-20T07:39:00.000Z	Tohuw	ActionParsnip	the troll, do not feed it.
2011-10-20T07:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tohuw	I eat trolls for brakfast dude
2011-10-20T07:45:00.000Z	Tohuw	ActionParsnip	you're missing the part where the user would prefer to complain rather than resolve.
2011-10-20T07:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tohuw	we'll get there, education is key :)
2011-10-20T08:12:00.000Z	Tohuw	ActionParsnip	dropbox is  not open.
2011-10-20T08:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tohuw	ah, missed that
2011-10-20T08:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tohuw	if they did then more folks would buy, look at nvidia
2011-10-20T08:42:00.000Z	Tohuw	ActionParsnip	Linux accounts for < 3% of the global consumer desktop market, and that's an optimistic perspective. Apple has no reason to promote usage of another OS. If they could get away without making Windows apps, they would. The key to success for Ubuntu is forging of its own path; not begging at the feet of software vendors to turn out more closed-source software so users can keep doing everything as they've always done it.
2011-10-20T08:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tohuw	so why have nvidia supported linux so well for so long?
2011-10-20T08:45:00.000Z	Tohuw	ActionParsnip	Because they don't have a vested interest in another OS? Because they manufacture chipsets for appliances that run Linux? Because Intel has more money than the Internet has lolcats?
2011-10-20T08:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tohuw	they do have vested interest in other OSes as gamers will almost always install Windows
2011-10-20T08:46:00.000Z	Tohuw	ActionParsnip	Correct, which is why most of their work goes towards Windows. However, they are not Microsoft. They don't make Windows. Cie la difference.
2011-10-20T08:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tohuw	its simply apples shortsightedness, just like everything they do.
