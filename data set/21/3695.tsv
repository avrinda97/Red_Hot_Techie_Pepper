2008-11-11T16:17:00.000Z	Tyrath	damaltor	System -> Administration -> Hardware Drivers - use the latest
2008-11-11T16:18:00.000Z	damaltor	Tyrath	the gefoprce4 doesnt show up here, while it did in earlier versions.
2008-11-11T16:21:00.000Z	Tyrath	damaltor	try apt-cache search xorg
2008-11-11T16:21:00.000Z	Tyrath	damaltor	see if theres some kind of install prog there
2008-11-11T16:21:00.000Z	Tyrath	damaltor	if that fails try ati instead of xorg
2008-11-11T16:22:00.000Z	damaltor	Tyrath	xorg is up and running, but not compatible with my card as stated in the release notes. i have a nvidia geforce4, so ati drivers will not be helpgul :) i think i will have to stick to 8.04 for a while.
2008-11-11T16:23:00.000Z	damaltor	Tyrath	cklick the notofier, let it try to update, and it will notice that everything is done. or restart X.
2008-11-11T16:23:00.000Z	Tyrath	damaltor	try searching for nvidia using the apt-cache tool - there should be some file that helps there
2008-11-11T16:23:00.000Z	damaltor	Tyrath	ok thanks so far..
2008-11-11T16:27:00.000Z	Tyrath	damaltor	sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx
2008-11-11T16:29:00.000Z	damaltor	Tyrath	tried that lots of times... the problem is not, how to istall the driver itself. the problem is that it seems to be incompatible according to the release notes on intrepid and according to my tests. i want to know if there is a new release from nvidia, wich have to bring that driver back to life for the new x server (wich can take a while cause geforce4 is a legacy produckt on weich not too many people will spend time @ nvidia)
2008-11-11T16:32:00.000Z	Tyrath	damaltor	in that case are you sure your driver is a geforce4?
2008-11-11T16:32:00.000Z	Tyrath	damaltor	otherwise try sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
2008-11-11T16:33:00.000Z	Tyrath	damaltor	hopefully it installs a fix that stops the problem occuring
2008-11-11T16:34:00.000Z	damaltor	Tyrath	i am sure i have a geforce 4, yes. i think ill have to wait fpr the new drivrs.
2008-11-11T16:34:00.000Z	Tyrath	damaltor	did you try updating ibex?
2008-11-11T16:36:00.000Z	Tyrath	damaltor	cause I have a geforce 7400 driver that works perfectly :/
2008-11-11T16:40:00.000Z	damaltor	Tyrath	the gefore 7400 is way newer.. the problem only affects geforce4 and earlier
2008-11-11T16:40:00.000Z	Tyrath	damaltor	ah. sorry I can't help :(
2008-11-11T16:43:00.000Z	Tyrath	damaltor	actually one last thing. backup /etc/X11/xorg.conf then vim /etc/X11/xorg.conf and try adding the lines at the bottom of this thread. Do ensure you backup the file first tho. I'm not sure if vim filename > filename.bak works or not
2008-11-11T16:43:00.000Z	Tyrath	damaltor	sorry when I said this thread I forgot to insert: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=423276
