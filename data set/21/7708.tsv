2006-07-30T05:32:00.000Z	linuxd00d	Jack_Sparrow	i get this message    The file format is invalid
2006-07-30T05:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	linuxd00d	It is probably installed and you need to go to theme details to pick clearlooks - dark nice
2006-07-30T05:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	linuxd00d	how about doing md5sum on that download
2006-07-30T05:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	linuxd00d	FYI that is a little too dark for me
2006-07-30T05:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	linuxd00d	 dont uncompress it... just drop it as is
2006-07-30T05:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	linuxd00d	fyi you go to term and run md5sum to get the checksum for a file
2006-07-30T05:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	linuxd00d	dafff907f41ac84dca44880fc722e9c9  GTK2-DarkNice.tar.gz
2006-07-30T05:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	linuxd00d	That looks like the prob
2006-07-30T05:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	linuxd00d	As long as it is working... I'm happy for you
2006-07-30T05:51:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	linuxd00d	ooops, overthinking the problem

2006-08-05T15:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	linuxd00d	How do I get it to Ub to try and autodetect the new modem?
2006-08-05T15:57:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	linuxd00d	Im not near that system now, so just a couple ideas to write down and try later would help, or just reinstall?
