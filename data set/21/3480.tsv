2009-07-11T19:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		so try the ones on the right hand side?
2009-07-11T19:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		I have used the disk labels in the /etc/fstab befor also. :)
2009-07-11T19:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		guess aaandaiii found the shortcut....
2009-07-11T19:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		:)
2009-07-11T19:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		err... a server iso - dosent use the gui installer...   it should haev the alternative-text based installer...
2009-07-11T19:45:00.000Z	\\`oot	Dr_Willis	OK, this is the one (from GA-tech.edu, US) that's actually NOT failing to install
2009-07-11T19:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	\\`oot	 if you wanted a GUI - thenyou really proberly did NOT want a 'server' install.
2009-07-11T19:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	\\`oot	 you proberly should of done a desktop, or alternative cd- install.
2009-07-11T20:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	\\`oot	 sounds like you may be having some weird hardware issues...
2009-07-11T20:03:00.000Z	\\`oot	Dr_Willis	Yes... but if I type "exit" it continues to boot normally
2009-07-11T20:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	\\`oot	 that dosent really prove much of anything... hd could be going out still.
2009-07-11T20:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	\\`oot	 check dmesg output after it runs a bit.. listen for weird hard drive noises..
2009-07-11T20:04:00.000Z	\\`oot	Dr_Willis	CRAP... well, I tried the desktop install on this first and it gave the weirdest errors I've ever seen... got to 50% and complained about media issues (dev sr0)... something funky like that
2009-07-11T20:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	\\`oot	 could be optical drive issues then.. or both...
2009-07-11T20:05:00.000Z	\\`oot	Dr_Willis	It's a 10k Ultra160 HD in a 1U server... this thing should be a tank - it ran for years before it sat in my basement for 6mo :(
2009-07-11T20:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	\\`oot	 hard drives are the MOST likely part of hardware to die from what ive seen... the fact its ran for years.. means very little :)
2009-07-11T20:06:00.000Z	\\`oot	Dr_Willis	I tried 4 DIFFERENT disks in it as primary
2009-07-11T20:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	\\`oot	 you could alwyas make a bootable-flash drive and install from that
2009-07-11T20:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	\\`oot	 ive also seen ide cables go bad.
2009-07-11T21:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	\\`oot	 no idea. check the forums perhaps.
2009-07-11T21:13:00.000Z	\\`oot	Dr_Willis	Thanks... this makes no sense... it's a SINGLE disk... if it finds boot sector WHY would it fail to find root on first try!?
