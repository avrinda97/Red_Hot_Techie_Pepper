2009-11-11T18:01:00.000Z	Sjors		I'm installing Ubuntu on the laptop of a friend of mine
2009-11-11T18:02:00.000Z	Sjors		she has a 300 GB NTFS partition which had 70GB free, don't know where exactly
2009-11-11T18:02:00.000Z	Sjors		we made an Ubuntu partition of 40 GB at the end of that partition
2009-11-11T18:02:00.000Z	Sjors		Anyway
2009-11-11T18:03:00.000Z	Sjors		It's making that partition now, I guess it's resizing the Windows partition
2009-11-11T18:03:00.000Z	Sjors		It's been on 0% for half an hour now, is that normal? (taking 40 GB off the end of a Windows partition in the Ubuntu installer)
2009-11-11T18:03:00.000Z	furuno	Sjors	: It is highly recommended that you defrag the partition beforehand
2009-11-11T18:04:00.000Z	Sjors	furuno	Windows defrag is enough?
2009-11-11T18:04:00.000Z	furuno	Sjors	: yes
2009-11-11T18:04:00.000Z	Sjors	furuno	can I reboot safely while it's changing partition size?
2009-11-11T18:04:00.000Z	furuno	Sjors	: I don't guarantee that :|
2009-11-11T18:05:00.000Z	Sjors	furuno	do you think the resize is safe? :)
2009-11-11T18:05:00.000Z	Sjors		i.e. it will only change records after copying the data
2009-11-11T18:05:00.000Z	furuno	Sjors	: safe enough for me, if you defrag beforehand :)
2009-11-11T18:06:00.000Z	furuno	Sjors	think of this as a partition [XXX X    XX  X                      X] (X is data, space is empty space)
2009-11-11T18:06:00.000Z	Sjors	furuno	I know how it works and what it does
2009-11-11T18:06:00.000Z	Sjors	furuno	just wanted to know how long it usually takes :)
2009-11-11T18:06:00.000Z	furuno	Sjors	look that data on the end might interrupting the resize operation
2009-11-11T18:06:00.000Z	furuno	Sjors	so that's why defrag is highly recommended
2009-11-11T18:07:00.000Z	Sjors	furuno	but the Ubuntu installer does run a defrag for the parts that will be gone, too
2009-11-11T18:07:00.000Z	furuno	Sjors	: then try wait for another hours
