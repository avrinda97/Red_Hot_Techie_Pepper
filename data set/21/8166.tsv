2006-07-24T07:06:00.000Z	RadiantFire		whoever asked the printer question, you will probably be ok with hp
2006-07-24T07:06:00.000Z	RadiantFire		they have generally good cups support
2006-07-24T07:06:00.000Z	matti_	RadiantFire	:no, thats why im asking
2006-07-24T07:06:00.000Z	RadiantFire	matti_	check the compatiablity liisting and linuxprinting.org
2006-07-24T07:06:00.000Z	matti_	RadiantFire	:the hp is labeled as a "windoes printer"
2006-07-24T07:06:00.000Z	matti_	RadiantFire	:I did
2006-07-24T07:07:00.000Z	RadiantFire	matti_	and what did it say?
2006-07-24T07:07:00.000Z	matti_	RadiantFire	:and they all seem to work, but none of them are described as "works grand", more like "lacks this, and that"
2006-07-24T07:07:00.000Z	RadiantFire	matti_	for most things you will be ok, unless you need some wierd mode
2006-07-24T07:09:00.000Z	matti_	RadiantFire	: probably u r right, but I wonder wich one is best the samsung has binary drivers, the HP has reversengineered drivers, so neither sound good...
2006-07-24T07:09:00.000Z	matti_	RadiantFire	: what is u r opinion ?
2006-07-24T07:09:00.000Z	RadiantFire	matti_	i have an hp that is listed as not fully functional, I've never had problems with it
2006-07-24T07:10:00.000Z	matti_	RadiantFire	: but maybe it supports Postscript nativily, the 2600 does not...
2006-07-24T07:10:00.000Z	RadiantFire	matti_	it depends how daring you are :-)
2006-07-24T07:10:00.000Z	matti_	RadiantFire	:can u elaborate on that ;=
2006-07-24T07:11:00.000Z	matti_	RadiantFire	:what HP do u have?
2006-07-24T07:11:00.000Z	RadiantFire	matti_	chances are, they will probably work for everything you need them for, unless you need some kind of specific feature
2006-07-24T07:12:00.000Z	matti_	RadiantFire	:ah, thats an inkjet, and they seem to work, the once I listed are lasers, It would be a pity to buy a printer and not be able to use it...
2006-07-24T07:12:00.000Z	matti_	RadiantFire	:I dont have any special needs, but if I aquire a color printer I would expect to be albe to print in color aswell
2006-07-24T07:14:00.000Z	matti_	RadiantFire	:do u know if cups or any other printer system can print to a printer that is not supported if it is on a windows host ?, I.e. could I share the printer from a windows machine and then print to it without the proper driver from cups/or whatever ?
2006-07-24T07:15:00.000Z	RadiantFire	matti_	i have no clue
