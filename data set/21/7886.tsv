2006-06-24T16:40:00.000Z	splashtech	dr3wster	just needs correct permissions
2006-06-24T16:48:00.000Z	splashtech	dr3wster	whats the problem again briefly?
2006-06-24T16:48:00.000Z	dr3wster	splashtech	PHP scripts won't run on my apache2.0 server
2006-06-24T16:48:00.000Z	splashtech	dr3wster	what does it do?
2006-06-24T16:48:00.000Z	dr3wster	splashtech	it asks me to download it.
2006-06-24T16:49:00.000Z	splashtech	dr3wster	is it named .phtml or .php?
2006-06-24T16:49:00.000Z	splashtech	dr3wster	try .php
2006-06-24T16:50:00.000Z	dr3wster	splashtech	the file itself is a .php file but firefox downloads a phtml file
2006-06-24T16:51:00.000Z	dr3wster	splashtech	could you please put my name in your messages so xchat highlights them? thanks:)
2006-06-24T16:53:00.000Z	splashtech	dr3wster	try this in your php file: <?php header('text/html'); echo "Your text"; ?>
2006-06-24T16:53:00.000Z	dr3wster	splashtech	I did , no go
2006-06-24T16:53:00.000Z	splashtech	dr3wster	same thing?
2006-06-24T16:53:00.000Z	dr3wster	splashtech	yep
2006-06-24T16:53:00.000Z	splashtech	dr3wster	I would
2006-06-24T16:54:00.000Z	splashtech	dr3wster	I'd personally go for complete. To be sure
2006-06-24T16:55:00.000Z	dr3wster	splashtech	 and Tonren should I also uninstall apache-common and apache-perl?
2006-06-24T16:55:00.000Z	splashtech	dr3wster	go for it. You dont need them for apache2. I beleive there are apache2-* versions of them
2006-06-24T16:56:00.000Z	dr3wster	splashtech	and Tonren, all right, I'm uninstalling now
2006-06-24T05:02:00.000Z	splashtech	dr3wster	Tonren: Good luck with your apache2/php. I'm off now, gotta be up early for work.
