2010-02-23T05:31:00.000Z	Sistk		hi, excuse me, It is any way to execute a visual basic aplication in ubuntu? (forgive me english please)
2010-02-23T05:32:00.000Z	Sistk		thanks nitsuga
2010-02-23T05:32:00.000Z	Sistk		Ill try
2010-02-23T05:33:00.000Z	dlynes	Sistk	You probably want the commercially supported 'CrossOver' product from CodeWeavers...it gives you way better Windows compatibility than the straight Wine subsystem
2010-02-23T05:34:00.000Z	dlynes	Sistk	It includes some extra windows support that runs in conjunction with the opensource wine
2010-02-23T05:34:00.000Z	dlynes	Sistk	http://www.codeweavers.com/
2010-02-23T05:37:00.000Z	dlynes	Sistk	for the price they charge for it, it's an excellent product, too
2010-02-23T05:39:00.000Z	dlynes	Sistk	That'll give you the most integrated approach, probably, with the least amount of resource consumption
2010-02-23T05:40:00.000Z	dlynes	Sistk	if you don't mind running a virtual machine, a virtual machine will give you the highest compatibility
2010-02-23T05:40:00.000Z	dlynes	Sistk	but not the highest speed
2010-02-23T05:41:00.000Z	Sistk	dlynes	i rreally cant have a virtual machine
2010-02-23T05:41:00.000Z	dlynes	Sistk	yeah, so you want CrossOver, then
2010-02-23T05:41:00.000Z	dlynes	Sistk	it's not really an option for us, either...we need to be able to communicate with PLC's over a serial port
2010-02-23T05:42:00.000Z	dlynes	Sistk	the hardware virtualization slows everything down so much that it doesn't respond fast enough, and the PLC stops communicating
2010-02-23T05:44:00.000Z	Sistk	dlynes	so you say that I couldnt comunicate with any hardware?
2010-02-23T05:44:00.000Z	dlynes	Sistk	no..you can
2010-02-23T05:44:00.000Z	dlynes	Sistk	but if there's specific hardware you need to communicate with, and you want to know compatibility
2010-02-23T05:45:00.000Z	dlynes	Sistk	i woudl call up codeweavers and ask them before you buy the product
2010-02-23T05:45:00.000Z	Sistk	dlynes	thank you so much, but I will download and try the product before buying it
2010-02-23T05:46:00.000Z	Sistk	dlynes	you are so helpfull
2010-02-23T05:46:00.000Z	dlynes	Sistk	yeah..i think they even have a special version of it for using with directx
