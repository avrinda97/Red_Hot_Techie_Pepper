2006-06-13T14:17:00.000Z	ajax4	krieger	I think you have to turn off RenderAccel in your xorg.conf file if you have problems with that.
2006-06-13T14:17:00.000Z	krieger	ajax4	thx i`ll try
2006-06-13T14:18:00.000Z	ajax4	krieger	np. You'll take a performance hit but thats the only thing I've found that stopped my system from crashing.
2006-06-13T14:19:00.000Z	krieger	ajax4	the only prob is, there is nothing like RenderAccel in my xorg.conf
2006-06-13T14:20:00.000Z	ajax4	krieger	cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf | grep RenderAccel returns nothing?
2006-06-13T14:20:00.000Z	krieger	ajax4	negative
2006-06-13T14:22:00.000Z	ajax4	krieger	Find the Section that has all the info of your video card in it. Then add a line that says: Option  "RenderAccel"   "Off"
2006-06-13T14:22:00.000Z	krieger	ajax4	yepp
2006-06-13T14:23:00.000Z	krieger	ajax4	mean the device section?
2006-06-13T14:23:00.000Z	ajax4	krieger	Add that line and restart your X server and see if you continue to have problems. My system stopped crashing after that.
2006-06-13T14:23:00.000Z	ajax4	krieger	Yes, the device section.
2006-06-13T14:24:00.000Z	krieger	ajax4	kay done... just waiting for downloads to end, and then i restart X and tell ya what happened kay? ^^
2006-06-13T14:24:00.000Z	ajax4	krieger	Good luck. How often does it crash now?
2006-06-13T14:25:00.000Z	krieger	ajax4	in Gentoo it crashed, killed my gentoo tried ubuntu now and... about 12 Times for now -.-
2006-06-13T14:25:00.000Z	ajax4	krieger	I mean how long does your system stay up before crashing?
2006-06-13T14:26:00.000Z	krieger	ajax4	dont know, i just pushed the reset button... but the strange thing is, i cant go into tty2 cause my keyboard isnt working but i can talk in skype xD
2006-06-13T14:26:00.000Z	ajax4	krieger	that is odd.
2006-06-13T14:26:00.000Z	krieger	ajax4	yepp
