2009-06-09T05:32:00.000Z	Polarina		When can I expect getting gcc-4.4?
2009-06-09T05:32:00.000Z	Gnea	Polarina	when it's ready
2009-06-09T05:33:00.000Z	Polarina	Gnea	Isn't it?
2009-06-09T05:33:00.000Z	Gnea	Polarina	not seeing it in the current repository, so no
2009-06-09T05:33:00.000Z	Polarina	Gnea	That's why I asked.
2009-06-09T05:33:00.000Z	Gnea	Polarina	might want to check with the 9.10 people in #ubuntu+1
2009-06-09T05:34:00.000Z	Gnea	Polarina	they have all of the latest & greatest ubuntuisms
2009-06-09T05:35:00.000Z	Gnea	Polarina	oh, you're a wesnoth person? I like you. :)
2009-06-09T05:36:00.000Z	Polarina	Gnea	:)
2009-06-09T05:39:00.000Z	Gnea	Polarina	is that a hardware problem?
2009-06-09T05:39:00.000Z	Polarina	Gnea	Yes.
2009-06-09T05:39:00.000Z	Gnea	Polarina	ouch. i have a similar problem on my desktop. so i setup pulseaudio and have it output via the lan to my laptop
2009-06-09T05:39:00.000Z	Gnea	Polarina	wesnoth plays perfectly and sounds great
2009-06-09T05:40:00.000Z	Polarina	Gnea	:)
2009-06-09T05:40:00.000Z	Gnea	Polarina	it's a total hack, and i could simply swap the soundcard out, but, I'm lazy :)
2009-06-09T05:40:00.000Z	Polarina	Gnea	:P
2009-06-09T05:41:00.000Z	Polarina	Gnea	I can live without sound on my laptop anyway. :)
2009-06-09T05:42:00.000Z	Gnea	Polarina	one of these days, when i've got it perfected and have the time, i'll write a howto up on the forums
2009-06-09T05:52:00.000Z	Gnea	Polarina	#ubuntu+1 would know... we only support up to 9.04 in this channel
2009-06-09T05:53:00.000Z	Polarina	Gnea	Ok.
2009-06-09T06:03:00.000Z	Gnea	Polarina	oi
