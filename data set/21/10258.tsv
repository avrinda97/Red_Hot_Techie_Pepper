2010-05-01T11:34:00.000Z	eric_		can someone tell me the command to install the gui login interface for bt4
2010-05-01T11:34:00.000Z	eric_		yes
2010-05-01T11:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eric_	 install a window manager that you like/and a gdm/kdm/xdm that you like.. and we dont support BT here. they have their own channel
2010-05-01T11:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eric_	 i suggest using  'ubuntu' if you are new to linux.
2010-05-01T11:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eric_	 install the proper packages using the package manager tools.
2010-05-01T11:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eric_	  'a program' for a GUI login - would be one of the ?dm login managers. such as gdm, kdm, or xdm or any of the others you can find by using the apt-cache search XXXXX    commands
2010-06-11T20:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eric_	 because sudo wont pop up a gui for the password. use gksudo
2010-06-11T20:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eric_	 and use an  editor that has a X gui   or else launch it in a 'terminal'
2010-06-11T20:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eric_	 You are using a text editor that has an actual X gui?
2010-06-11T20:44:00.000Z	eric_	Dr_Willis	adding gksudo prompted me for a password, but nothing happened after entering it, so by launch it in a terminal do you mean i have to specify in the launcher that its to open in a terminal?
2010-06-11T20:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eric_	 use a text editor that has an actual X gui like gedit. not vi.
2010-06-11T20:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eric_	 or make the alias run a terminal that runs the commands..   'xterm -e commandtorun'
2010-06-11T20:50:00.000Z	eric_	Dr_Willis	thank you sir, got it working
2010-10-19T21:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eric_	 depends on the problem
2010-10-19T21:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eric_	 from a termional run 'compiz --replace' and see if any errors are reported.
2010-10-19T21:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eric_	 No errors?  no messages no anything?
2010-10-19T21:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eric_	 So compuiz should be working..  try installing and running the 'ccsm' or 'simple' ccsm tool/gui and enable some effects.
2010-10-19T21:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eric_	 means nothing to me.  You may want to check the forums for the error messages you are getting. could be some odd bug.
