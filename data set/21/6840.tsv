2007-02-13T11:10:00.000Z	yamathan		Quick question -- what's the verdict on DRI support in the most recent proprietary fglrx binary?
2007-02-13T11:10:00.000Z	yamathan		So is downloadthemall! in conjunction in terms of a Firefox extension.
2007-02-13T11:11:00.000Z	yamathan		wget is a good command-line one.
2007-02-13T11:11:00.000Z	yamathan		Y'know ...
2007-02-13T11:11:00.000Z	yamathan		I hate to sound to snotty, but I just want my ATI card to work, you know?
2007-02-13T11:12:00.000Z	yamathan		I love the fact that I can fuck with Linux as much as I want, but, uh, I want my ATI card to WORK.  I don't care if the binary is proprietary or not for some applications.
2007-02-13T11:13:00.000Z	yamathan		Oh, sorry unop.
2007-02-13T11:13:00.000Z	unop	yamathan	 kids and women frequent this channel .. they'd appreciate some gentlemanleness :)
2007-02-13T11:13:00.000Z	unop		!botabuse | sable  :)
2007-02-13T11:14:00.000Z	yamathan		Eh, sometimes I forget that not everyone curses produsely.
2007-02-13T11:14:00.000Z	yamathan	sable	 That'd be great if some packages don't contradict one another.
2007-02-13T11:14:00.000Z	yamathan		And if you have conflicting repositories ...
2007-02-13T11:15:00.000Z	yamathan		Hmm?  Isn't there a special boot --debug command?
2007-02-13T11:16:00.000Z	unop	yamathan	 have you followed the instructions as per !ati ?
2007-02-13T11:16:00.000Z	yamathan		What's the verdict on ATI R300 support as of the 8.33.thingamajig?
2007-02-13T11:16:00.000Z	yamathan		Unop, I'm a little leery -- the last time I did the DRI issues were ... not good.
2007-02-13T11:17:00.000Z	yamathan		*thingamajig = update
2007-02-13T11:17:00.000Z	unop	yamathan	 things change quite fast with ubuntu -- :)
2007-02-13T11:17:00.000Z	yamathan		I thought it was the x1000series.
2007-02-13T11:17:00.000Z	yamathan		Unop -- I think it was ... what, four months ago?
2007-02-13T11:17:00.000Z	unop	yamathan	 worth a try then , definitely :)
