2008-05-07T14:28:00.000Z	Raelic		I think my grub is uninstalled or something
2008-05-07T14:28:00.000Z	Raelic		I typed sudo fdisk -l and it came up with the stuff
2008-05-07T14:29:00.000Z	Raelic		How do I tell grub where my HDD are?
2008-05-07T14:29:00.000Z	Raelic		Like I mean

2008-05-07T14:32:00.000Z	Raelic		Error 21: Selected disk does not exist
2008-05-07T14:32:00.000Z	ikonia	Raelic	that's not the correct disk then
2008-05-07T14:33:00.000Z	ikonia	Raelic	sorry, that was for you
2008-05-07T14:33:00.000Z	ikonia	Raelic	/dev/sda is not always hd0
2008-05-07T14:33:00.000Z	ikonia	Raelic	also look at your boot.map in your /boot directory/partition
2008-05-07T14:35:00.000Z	ikonia	Raelic	not /boot/boot.map, actually /boot/device.map
2008-05-07T14:36:00.000Z	ikonia	Raelic	well, done, typo on my part
2008-05-07T14:36:00.000Z	ikonia	Raelic	which grub file ?
2008-05-07T14:37:00.000Z	ikonia	Raelic	which grub file is empty foryou ?
2008-05-07T14:37:00.000Z	ikonia	Raelic	there is no such file as "default"
2008-05-07T14:38:00.000Z	ikonia	Raelic	thats not a grub file
2008-05-07T14:38:00.000Z	ikonia	Raelic	who told you to use /boot/grub/default.txt ?
