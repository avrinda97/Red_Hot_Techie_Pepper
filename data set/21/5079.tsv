2008-01-05T00:47:00.000Z	matholum		mine has a video input that i can't get working
2008-01-05T00:47:00.000Z	matholum		(sorry for just jumping in... hello everyone)
2008-01-05T00:49:00.000Z	matholum		does anyone know how to remove old, uninstalled programs out of the wine programs list?
2008-01-05T00:50:00.000Z	khermans	matholum	uninstaller ?
2008-01-05T01:03:00.000Z	khermans	matholum	kino
2008-01-05T01:12:00.000Z	khermans	matholum	np
2008-01-05T01:18:00.000Z	khermans	matholum	open/import ?
2008-01-05T01:18:00.000Z	khermans	matholum	you need to work with RAW files
2008-01-05T01:21:00.000Z	khermans	matholum	kino does it automatically for you - but be prepared to wait a while
2008-01-05T01:21:00.000Z	khermans	matholum	what file type is this?
2008-01-05T01:22:00.000Z	khermans	matholum	it should import it ... but if not, you can convert with ffmpeg or mencoder
2008-01-05T14:29:00.000Z	khermans	matholum	is it mounted read-only or perhaps it is fat, and wont let you modify permissions
2008-01-05T14:30:00.000Z	khermans	matholum	then the permissions shouldn't matter
2008-01-05T14:30:00.000Z	khermans	matholum	man mount, check out the umask option
2008-01-05T14:35:00.000Z	khermans	matholum	np
2008-01-05T14:56:00.000Z	matholum	khermans	i set the umask to 000... i don't know if that is secure, but i can edit the folders and files even though the owner is still root (and i can't change that either)... but hey, it works ^_^ thanks
2008-01-05T14:57:00.000Z	khermans	matholum	np
2008-01-05T15:00:00.000Z	khermans	matholum	ln -s ?
2008-01-05T15:03:00.000Z	khermans	matholum	?
2008-01-05T15:03:00.000Z	khermans	matholum	ln -sf ?
