2010-07-30T16:56:00.000Z	Chillance		what would you guys say would be the easiest and best way to run games and wine in full screen, but only on main (left) monitor? (I use a dual monitor setup)
2010-07-30T16:56:00.000Z	Chillance		this just works fine in windows, but there are some issues in ubuntu...
2010-07-30T16:57:00.000Z	Chillance		like mouse coordinates are wrong or it uses both screens
2010-07-30T16:57:00.000Z	Chillance		aha, and for native ubuntu games+
2010-07-30T16:57:00.000Z	Chillance		?
2010-07-30T16:58:00.000Z	Chillance		it tends to use both screens, where middle is inbetween
2010-07-30T16:58:00.000Z	randy_	Chillance	i've seen this before.
2010-07-30T16:58:00.000Z	randy_	Chillance	you have Nvidia, right?
2010-07-30T17:06:00.000Z	Chillance	randy_	yes, nvidia
2010-07-30T17:06:00.000Z	randy_	Chillance	reference the Nvidia documentation for the Nvidia linux drivers on something called 'TwinView'
2010-07-30T17:06:00.000Z	Chillance		I mean, I dont want to disable the second screen all the time
2010-07-30T17:07:00.000Z	randy_	Chillance	this is what i'm doing, and i like it a *lot* i can full screen either monitor (without spreading it out across both) and i keep the ability to move my mouse between them like its one big desktop
2010-07-30T17:07:00.000Z	randy_	Chillance	but, to answer your question, fullscreen works the way i want, on only *one* monitor, in wine
2010-07-30T17:08:00.000Z	Chillance	randy_	 yes, in wine I get it on one screen too, but the mouse coordinates are off
2010-07-30T17:09:00.000Z	Chillance		running a few ubuntu games, it gets stretched across both screens
2010-07-30T17:09:00.000Z	randy_	Chillance	well, if you have that problem, you should probably go ask the wine guys then ;) i just know how to help with the dual-monitor thing ;)
2010-07-30T17:09:00.000Z	Chillance		I just want games to show up on one screen
2010-07-30T17:09:00.000Z	Chillance		so
2010-07-30T17:09:00.000Z	Chillance	randy_	do you use some special script or so to trigger where the game show up?
2010-07-30T17:10:00.000Z	Chillance		the desktop runs over both screens
2010-07-30T17:11:00.000Z	randy_	Chillance	yeah, i agree with Dr_Willis
