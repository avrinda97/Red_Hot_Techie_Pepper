2007-12-15T20:49:00.000Z	FallenStrife		if i install it without the disk on a seperate partition i wouldnt mess anything up with XP would i?
2007-12-15T20:50:00.000Z	mattwalston	FallenStrife	explain a little better, disks have partitions not partitions having disks
2007-12-15T20:51:00.000Z	mattwalston	FallenStrife	their are ways but I have never done it... if you select the partition while installing it may be destructive
2007-12-15T20:53:00.000Z	mattwalston	FallenStrife	yes, or any other operating system
2007-12-15T20:53:00.000Z	mattwalston	FallenStrife	get vmware-server, free as in beer and use a flat file as a disk drive
2007-12-15T20:53:00.000Z	mattwalston	FallenStrife	you will emulate a hard disk using 2gb files without reformating partition
2007-12-15T20:54:00.000Z	mattwalston	FallenStrife	you can always stop vmware or uninstall it if you don't like it, so yes it is reversable
2007-12-15T20:55:00.000Z	mattwalston	FallenStrife	vmware emulates additional physical machines within your machine
2007-12-15T20:55:00.000Z	mattwalston	FallenStrife	yeah, shutdown the guest os and your ram is freed up
2007-12-15T20:56:00.000Z	mattwalston	FallenStrife	definetly for pure ease try the live cd and then you already have an installer that you can use for vmware if you like what you see
2007-12-15T20:57:00.000Z	mattwalston	FallenStrife	good luck and AstralSin is right, just pick the iso
2007-12-15T21:01:00.000Z	mattwalston	FallenStrife	no, get server unless someone has a virtual machine for you
