2006-03-20T07:36:00.000Z	katarot		no it not here
2006-03-20T07:37:00.000Z	katarot		ok thanks
2006-03-20T07:37:00.000Z	chuckyp	katarot	what type of card?
2006-03-20T10:54:00.000Z	chuckyp	katarot	did you get your ndiswrapper drivers to detect your card yet?
2006-03-20T10:54:00.000Z	chuckyp	katarot	and I think when you use those you may have to ifup eth#
2006-03-20T11:17:00.000Z	chuckyp	katarot	is the card showing up like if you do iwconfig?  or ifconfig?
2006-03-20T11:17:00.000Z	chuckyp	katarot	iwconfig -a ifconfig -a
2006-03-20T11:20:00.000Z	chuckyp	katarot	yeah lol I was saying # just to mean number.   Like insert your number there.  But yeah if you do a iwconfig -a after ndiswrapper is loaded and everything it should show you card.  Then you just hav eto configure it for the network.
2006-03-20T11:21:00.000Z	chuckyp	katarot	well you get ndiswrapper loaded with the proper drivers.
2006-03-20T11:21:00.000Z	chuckyp	katarot	then if you do an iwconfig -a or ifconfig -a  (may need sudo infront of that) your card should show up.
2006-03-20T11:22:00.000Z	chuckyp	katarot	Just to see if its working.   Then all you need to do is configure it.
2006-03-23T08:20:00.000Z	chuckyp	katarot	still didn't get it working?
2006-03-23T08:20:00.000Z	chuckyp	katarot	what chipset is on the card?
2006-03-23T08:20:00.000Z	katarot	chuckyp	nope the driver is installed tho
2006-03-23T08:20:00.000Z	chuckyp	katarot	what chipset is the card is it bc43xx?
2006-03-23T08:21:00.000Z	chuckyp	katarot	because I saw someone the other day saying those drivers where compiled in the kernel
2006-03-23T08:21:00.000Z	chuckyp	katarot	what is the model number of the card or is it built in the laptop?
2006-03-23T08:21:00.000Z	chuckyp	katarot	what kind of dell?
2006-03-23T08:22:00.000Z	chuckyp	katarot	k hold up let me do some checking i'll get ya working here.
