2009-11-18T22:06:00.000Z	freeride	DasEi2	ok, thanks you
2009-11-18T22:07:00.000Z	DasEi2	freeride	also in there you configure allowed users and dirs -- that's one thing ..
2009-11-18T22:08:00.000Z	DasEi2	freeride	the other is to have a user on your server that's corresponding with your xp-setup, and that is allowed to access desired folders
2009-11-18T22:15:00.000Z	freeride	DasEi2	Tell me please, how do i restart samba serv

2009-11-18T22:20:00.000Z	freeride	DasEi2	Thank you, I've just added some folders in smb.conf. Now it works well.
