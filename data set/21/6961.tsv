2007-02-26T11:37:00.000Z	preaction	Yodude	though i'm hesitant to say that having trouble setting up a download manager for your pr0n is a big problem
2007-02-26T11:37:00.000Z	Yodude	preaction	i have a really bad internet connection and i used to keep up with it by using DAP on windows, i used it with flashgot, now using MultiGet for loinux i can't integrate it with flashgot!
2007-02-26T11:38:00.000Z	Yodude	preaction	it's a very critical problem because my connection is only 7KBites per second down you see
2007-02-26T11:38:00.000Z	preaction	Yodude	you have more options than you think. what keeps your connection up?
2007-02-26T11:38:00.000Z	Yodude	preaction	it does accept command line arguments btw but i don't know how to enter them in
2007-02-26T11:39:00.000Z	Yodude	preaction	a handy Download manager with a good interface maybe?
2007-02-26T11:39:00.000Z	preaction	Yodude	to be honest, a flashgot forum would be far better than an ubuntu IRC channel
2007-02-26T11:39:00.000Z	preaction	Yodude	but what specifically about your download manager keeps your connection up?
2007-02-26T11:39:00.000Z	preaction	Yodude	google is your friend
2007-02-26T11:51:00.000Z	Yodude	preaction	i couldn't find anything in the forums but i did find this though about adding command arguments for MultiGet: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/7671/
2007-02-26T11:51:00.000Z	Yodude	preaction	can you help me add these arguments to flashgot?
2007-02-26T11:51:00.000Z	preaction	Yodude	no, i don't use either software
2007-02-26T11:52:00.000Z	Yodude	preaction	do you think anyone here can help?
2007-02-26T11:52:00.000Z	preaction	Yodude	did you even try http://flashgot.net/
2007-02-26T11:52:00.000Z	Yodude	preaction	duh of course i did
2007-02-26T11:52:00.000Z	Yodude	preaction	i know the way, i just can't get it right
