2005-12-10T11:21:00.000Z	corndog		if its video, ive used vlc player to view .bin files
2005-12-10T11:23:00.000Z	corndog		dont binaries need to be compiled
2005-12-10T11:23:00.000Z	mrkoje	corndog	binaries are already compiled
2005-12-10T11:23:00.000Z	corndog		my bad
2005-12-10T11:23:00.000Z	mrkoje	corndog	what needs to be compiled is the source
2005-12-10T11:24:00.000Z	corndog	mrkoje	can you tell me what can be used to stop certain processes from running at startup
2005-12-10T11:25:00.000Z	mrkoje	corndog	what process are you talking about
2005-12-10T11:25:00.000Z	corndog		none in particular. i figure i can look them up and determine if i need them. 71 seems like too many
2005-12-10T11:25:00.000Z	mrkoje	corndog	There is a good utility called "BUM" which is Boot-up Manager
2005-12-10T11:26:00.000Z	mrkoje	corndog	it is a gui for gnome... apt-get install bum
2005-12-10T11:26:00.000Z	corndog		im running kde
2005-12-10T11:26:00.000Z	mrkoje	corndog	you could edit the init files...   bum or the cli is better though
2005-12-10T11:27:00.000Z	corndog		will they work with kubuntu
2005-12-10T11:27:00.000Z	mrkoje	corndog	im not sure bum will or not... are you on kubuntu?
2005-12-10T11:27:00.000Z	corndog		yeah
2005-12-10T11:27:00.000Z	mrkoje	corndog	or just install kde on ubuntu
2005-12-10T11:27:00.000Z	corndog		no, 5.10 breezy
2005-12-10T11:28:00.000Z	corndog		it sounds like more folks prefer gnome
2005-12-10T11:29:00.000Z	mrkoje	corndog	it doesn't really matter
2005-12-10T11:30:00.000Z	mrkoje	corndog	i don't know of any boot up managers for kde.. not really familiar with kde at all.
2005-12-10T11:30:00.000Z	mrkoje	corndog	I know there is though... you will just have to search
