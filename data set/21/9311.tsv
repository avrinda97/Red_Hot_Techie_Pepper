2005-10-10T11:48:00.000Z	regeya		heh
2005-10-10T11:49:00.000Z	mister_roboto	regeya	there sure is an assload of J2EE code out there now, even if you don't consider it to have taken over the world
2005-10-10T11:50:00.000Z	regeya	mister_roboto	hi.
2005-10-10T11:50:00.000Z	mister_roboto	regeya	hi :)
2005-10-10T11:51:00.000Z	regeya	mister_roboto	true, and lthere's an assload of freebsd machines acting as servers of various types, but it's hardly taken over the world either.  depends on your definition of "world domination" I suppose
2005-10-10T11:52:00.000Z	mister_roboto	regeya	I would argue that the importance of J2EE to the business world is just about, if not quite, infinitely larger than the importance of bsd to the biz world :)
2005-10-10T11:55:00.000Z	mister_roboto	regeya	my only point being, of course, that the Sun license on Java has done absolutely nothing to slow down its adoption by the biz community. yeah, some Debian folks don't like it but doesn't make the slightest diff to the rest of the world
2005-10-10T11:55:00.000Z	regeya	mister_roboto	I always wondered what caused J2EE to make it so big.  great salesmanship?
2005-10-10T11:55:00.000Z	mister_roboto	regeya	no, the fact that it makes multithreaded, transactional code MUCH easier than it used to be
2005-10-10T11:56:00.000Z	mister_roboto	regeya	and there are tons of libraries packaged with it instead of having to roll your own, well, just about anything  (for business programming anyway)
2005-10-10T11:57:00.000Z	regeya	mister_roboto	I was actually thinking back to the last time I actually used a Java app on a Windows XP machine.  'Coz the last time I installed a Java app, I had to install Java.  I seem to recall people going apeshit about how great Java would be for *desktop users*.  And I never understood the sense of bytecode-compiled apps running on a VM as a great way to write an enterprise app, but maybe that's why I'm not a professiona
2005-10-10T11:59:00.000Z	mister_roboto	regeya	actually, we're getting to the point where machines are just getting fast enough for that to work. open office and eclipse are the biggest examples right now i know. and besides, the hotspot compiler means it's no longer just bytecode running
2005-10-14T09:57:00.000Z	mister_roboto	regeya	you using kde?
2006-06-15T09:19:00.000Z	mister_roboto	regeya	stick to "vi" and you'll be happier ;)
2006-06-15T09:20:00.000Z	regeya	mister_roboto	I'm beginning to dig the do-anything-and-multi-platform aspect of emacs.  plus viper-mode makes it tolerable. ;-)
2006-06-15T09:21:00.000Z	mister_roboto	regeya	well to each his own. options are good :)   for editing, i forced myself to learn vi because it's ALWAYS there, no matter what unix box i go to
2006-06-15T09:22:00.000Z	regeya	mister_roboto	I forced myself to bash my head against a wall because while a book or TV may not always be available I can almost always count on walls
2006-06-15T09:23:00.000Z	mister_roboto	regeya	lol.  the beauty of vi is that your fingers get to stay on the home row so it's very fast to use for a  touch typist. but i understand why a lot of folks hate it. i did too at first.
2006-06-15T09:24:00.000Z	regeya	mister_roboto	you may have missed the bit about me forcing myself to like emacs these days...what do you think I've been using since 1997? :-P
2006-06-15T09:24:00.000Z	mister_roboto	regeya	 hah... point taken
2006-06-15T09:25:00.000Z	mister_roboto	regeya	i even do it in eclipse!
