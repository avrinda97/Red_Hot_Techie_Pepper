2005-08-25T06:21:00.000Z	kafeine		well, it is newer, you can count on that
2005-08-25T06:21:00.000Z	kafeine		but it can't par with hoary's stability, yet.
2005-08-25T06:22:00.000Z	kafeine		breezy's stable for me too:)
2005-08-25T06:22:00.000Z	kafeine		and for a lot of us
2005-08-25T06:23:00.000Z	kafeine		but i wouldn't recommend breezy to newbies yet
2005-08-25T06:23:00.000Z	kafeine		what exactly do you want to do?
2005-08-25T06:23:00.000Z	kafeine		well
2005-08-25T06:23:00.000Z	kafeine		that's gonna need formatting
2005-08-25T06:24:00.000Z	kafeine		yup
2005-08-25T06:24:00.000Z	tristanmike	kafeine	can't he resize the partition??
2005-08-25T06:24:00.000Z	kafeine	tristanmike	mmm
2005-08-25T06:24:00.000Z	tristanmike	kafeine	lol
2005-08-25T06:24:00.000Z	tristanmike	kafeine	ok, Marge...
2005-08-25T06:25:00.000Z	tristanmike	kafeine	the wiki says this... https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Installation/I386
2005-08-25T06:25:00.000Z	kafeine	tristanmike	possible
2005-08-25T06:26:00.000Z	tristanmike	kafeine	as long as you defrag the piss out of it.....
2005-08-25T06:26:00.000Z	tristanmike	kafeine	of course, if you can convince a re-format, then cudos to you
2005-08-25T06:28:00.000Z	kafeine	tristanmike	a clean format will certainly be less dangerous
2005-08-25T06:28:00.000Z	tristanmike	kafeine	I mean, that's how i did it, and just left room for the FAT and ext systems
2005-08-25T06:29:00.000Z	tristanmike	kafeine	it's the best way, I wouldn't dissagree there at all
