2005-11-02T13:03:00.000Z	intelikey		anyone know where the info is that tells apt where to look for the cdrom ?  <---- original wuaestion
2005-11-02T13:04:00.000Z	cge	intelikey	In /etc/apt/sources.list?
2005-11-02T13:06:00.000Z	cge	intelikey	If I remember correctly, there is a line in /etc/apt/sources.list for the cdrom, but I am running dapper and removed the line. You can also look at the apt-cdrom command.
2005-11-02T13:07:00.000Z	intelikey	cge	thank you, but you have no idea what i was asking.
2005-11-02T13:07:00.000Z	cge	intelikey	what were you asking?
2005-11-02T13:08:00.000Z	cge	intelikey	What do you mean?
2005-11-02T13:09:00.000Z	intelikey	cge	not if there was a cdrom source.   i know about /etc/apt/sources.list .   but what peace of code tells apt the address to the cdrom drive.        and yes bob2 thank you i got that the first time.
2006-04-26T11:41:00.000Z	intelikey	cge	 i kinda doubt it.   seeing it's a CD
2006-04-26T11:41:00.000Z	cge	intelikey	oh
2006-04-27T11:32:00.000Z	intelikey	cge	with 16m ram on a 486 lappy  i installed mdk9  hehhe   it works well.... not as fast as one would like, but very usable.
2006-04-27T11:33:00.000Z	cge	intelikey	yes, it's apparently the 4 mb that causes the problem.
2006-04-27T11:34:00.000Z	intelikey	cge	yes linux is a ram hog no doubt
2006-04-27T11:34:00.000Z	intelikey	cge	the ubuntu initrd wont even unpack in 4m ram
2006-04-27T11:35:00.000Z	cge	intelikey	FlannelKing: I tried this years before ubuntu existed. I was using mulinux, running a heavily stripped 2.0 kernel.
2006-05-15T14:58:00.000Z	cge	intelikey	the procs are uninterruptable and won't be killed by cycling to init 1, I believe.
