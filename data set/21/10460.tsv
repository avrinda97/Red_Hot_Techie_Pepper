2005-04-09T14:22:00.000Z	e_machinist		I personally have a radeon and it works perfectly fine... no extra drivers needed.
2005-04-09T14:23:00.000Z	e_machinist		What FPS do you get when running most of the screen savers?
2005-04-09T14:24:00.000Z	e_machinist		That is funny... my Radeon 9200 runs all the screensavers around 40-45FPS.
2005-04-09T14:25:00.000Z	e_machinist		What radeon you got borgista?
2005-04-09T14:27:00.000Z	e_machinist		glxgears reports around 1,500fps on average for my Radeon 9200... pretty nice.
2005-04-09T14:28:00.000Z	e_machinist		Did you find a prebuilt driver for Ubuntu stu?
2005-04-09T14:30:00.000Z	e_machinist		I'll install fglrx, see if I get even better acceleration than I already am.
2005-04-09T14:32:00.000Z	e_machinist		meh. Don't know. I just config my monitor refresh rate from the gnome settings.
2005-04-09T14:32:00.000Z	lunitik	e_machinist	sure... if its present... else, see my last comment
2005-04-09T14:33:00.000Z	lunitik	e_machinist	*cough* nano *cough*
2005-04-09T14:34:00.000Z	lunitik	e_machinist	most distro's just make pico a symlink to nano for old-timers
2005-04-09T14:34:00.000Z	lunitik	e_machinist	pico is closed source... nano is a gnu project...
2005-04-09T14:37:00.000Z	lunitik	e_machinist	it is irritating to your pupils though, even if you can't see it... I guess if you don't get headaches though, its all good  :/
2005-04-09T14:41:00.000Z	lunitik	e_machinist	even NTFS isn't _that_ bad...
2005-04-09T14:42:00.000Z	lunitik	e_machinist	they do work with it (merging things from the other journeled fs's in the kernel etc) regularly...
2005-04-09T14:42:00.000Z	lunitik	e_machinist	I believe it first was seen during 2.3 devel cycle though...
2005-04-10T15:50:00.000Z	lunitik	e_machinist	yes
2005-04-10T15:52:00.000Z	lunitik	e_machinist	2.8
2005-04-11T14:40:00.000Z	e_machinist	lunitik	you have no ego? You must cease to exist before you can contain no ego.
2005-04-11T14:41:00.000Z	lunitik	e_machinist	I have pride... not an ego... I do not believe I am better or worse than anyone.
2005-04-11T14:42:00.000Z	e_machinist	lunitik	 I never said that you did. We all have pride or ego... tis the nature of humanity.
