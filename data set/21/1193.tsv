2011-01-01T23:01:00.000Z	Guest58991		is there  a prob with the 10.10 network - tried kubuntu and ubuntu  and a distro based on it and can't connect eth0 or wlan0
2011-01-01T23:01:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest58991	sounds like it's not recognizing your devices for whatever reason...
2011-01-01T23:02:00.000Z	Guest58991	KM0201	it does an i can contact AP (router) just not outside it -- all other computers work
2011-01-01T23:03:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest58991	then my first thought would be something inside the router that is not allowing it out...
2011-01-01T23:03:00.000Z	Guest58991	KM0201	no every other computer can use it
2011-01-01T23:03:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest58991	now thats for your ethernet.... your wireless could be a whole other issue.
2011-01-01T23:03:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest58991	so?
2011-01-01T23:04:00.000Z	Guest58991	KM0201	then it's not th router
2011-01-01T23:04:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest58991	i'm amazed you needed to come here, you have all the answers(for what its worth,d ealt w/ this yesterday, and it WAS the router)
2011-01-01T23:06:00.000Z	Guest58991	KM0201	all the older versions work as do all other distroes -- just not anything with network-manager --- ass i never got help yesterday -- everytime i come here there is a prick like you
2011-01-01T23:06:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest58991	well, sorry you think i'm a prick, yous houldn't feel obligated to reply further...
2011-01-01T23:07:00.000Z	Guest58991	KM0201	great then shut up
2011-01-01T23:07:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest58991	i didn't say you got help yesterday, i said i dealt w th the same problem, and resolved it by fixing the router.. go ahead though, trudge on
2011-01-01T23:07:00.000Z	Guest58991	KM0201	it's not the router ever other distro i install works
2011-01-01T23:08:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest58991	ok.. you seem to feel intent on convincing me of this.. i could care less, my internet works just fine.
2011-01-01T23:09:00.000Z	Guest58991	KM0201	mine as well - just not with 10.10
2011-01-01T23:09:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest58991	well, then i guess you have issues.
2011-01-01T23:09:00.000Z	Guest58991	KM0201	yes you are one of them
2011-01-01T23:09:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest58991	then why are you inclined to talk to me?.. there's 1300 people here, find someone else to whine to.
2011-01-01T23:10:00.000Z	Guest58991	KM0201	please be quiet
2011-01-01T23:10:00.000Z	KM0201	Guest58991	all youhave to do is stop talking to me.. i offered to end this long ago.
