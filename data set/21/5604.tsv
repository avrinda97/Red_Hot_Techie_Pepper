2009-07-25T00:53:00.000Z	fwaokda		I installed windows7 on 80gb drive, then swapped the boot options in bios to load the 400gb drive first and installed ubuntu, then edited the grub to point to the windows7 drive. But it now hangs at a message saying, "loading stage 2... " when trying to boot into windows 7. Can anyone help me with this???

2009-07-25T00:55:00.000Z	DWonderly	fwaokda	what do you have the windows7 drive partitioned as?
2009-07-25T00:57:00.000Z	fwaokda	DWonderly	what do you mean? It's on it's own disk 400gb - it's the only thing on there AFAIK
2009-07-25T00:58:00.000Z	fwaokda	DWonderly	sorry not 400gb disk but 80gb disk
2009-07-25T00:58:00.000Z	fwaokda	DWonderly	400gb is my ubuntu disk
2009-07-25T00:58:00.000Z	DWonderly	fwaokda	right... fat? fat32? NTFS? something else?
2009-07-25T01:04:00.000Z	DWonderly	fwaokda	you installed windows after Linux or vice versa?
2009-07-25T01:04:00.000Z	fwaokda	DWonderly	Windows then linux
2009-07-25T01:04:00.000Z	fwaokda	DWonderly	and they're on seperate drives
2009-07-25T01:05:00.000Z	fwaokda	DWonderly	losher - going to restart and try booting from hd(0,1)
2009-07-25T01:05:00.000Z	DWonderly	fwaokda	what do you use for boot options? Grub? or to you change the bios?
2009-07-25T01:06:00.000Z	fwaokda	DWonderly	after I installed Windows then I installed Ubuntu, but to get it to boot to the Grub, I swapped to the 400gb disk to boot first in the bios
2009-07-25T01:07:00.000Z	DWonderly	fwaokda	losher correct me if im wrong but didn't Vista have problems booting to a non primary drive in bios? if so then would that programming change over to Win7?
2009-07-25T01:08:00.000Z	fwaokda	DWonderly	ok well if it doesn't work I'll come back and explore that option BRB
2009-07-25T01:28:00.000Z	DWonderly	fwaokda	did it all work?
2009-07-25T01:29:00.000Z	fwaokda	DWonderly	had to change the option to (hd1,0) which was the small partition labeled "SYSTEM" that windows7 installed on the drive during installation but after that it worked ;)
2009-07-25T01:30:00.000Z	DWonderly	fwaokda	great! glad it wasnt' what I thought lol
2009-07-25T01:30:00.000Z	fwaokda	DWonderly	ya that wouldn't have been good haha
