2005-04-23T11:19:00.000Z	Servo888		Hello - your installer lies, you need more than 24mb to install ubuntu.
2005-04-23T11:20:00.000Z	Servo888		So I have a 120mhz, pentium, with 24mb of ram. It's a laptop. I want to install a base installation to it. But when doing either a server install or any install for that matter the kernel panics and the previous message says out of memory.
2005-04-23T11:21:00.000Z	CarlK	Servo888	- I was able to get it to install on a 24 meg box by enabeling swap 1/2 into the install
2005-04-23T11:22:00.000Z	CarlK	Servo888	- Alt-F2
2005-04-23T11:24:00.000Z	Servo888	CarlK	the kernel panics, so I can't get into the second console.
2005-04-23T11:27:00.000Z	CarlK	Servo888	- does the installer get past the drive partitioning step?
2005-04-23T11:27:00.000Z	Servo888	CarlK	it doesn't finish loading the kernel.
2005-04-23T11:28:00.000Z	CarlK	Servo888	- the Installer kernel, or do you get the system isntalled and then when you reboot it panics?
2005-04-23T11:28:00.000Z	CarlK	Servo888	- so you can't even boot the install CD?
2005-04-23T11:29:00.000Z	Servo888	CarlK	nope =-(
2005-04-23T11:30:00.000Z	CarlK	Servo888	- 24mb should be plenty for the kernel, so something else may be wrong
2005-04-23T11:32:00.000Z	Servo888	CarlK	I dont know - with the ramdisk created by the installer it's cutting it close.
2005-04-23T11:33:00.000Z	Servo888	CarlK	do you know if there is like a memtest packages with ubuntu?
2005-04-23T11:33:00.000Z	CarlK	Servo888	- yes, it gets installed as a boot option ;)
2005-04-23T11:34:00.000Z	Servo888	CarlK	I mean on the bootcd
2005-04-23T11:35:00.000Z	CarlK	Servo888	- not that I know of.  you might want to do this: http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/LocalNetInstall
2005-04-23T11:36:00.000Z	CarlK	Servo888	- also, I can show you how to make a net boot memtest86+ option really easy
2005-04-23T11:37:00.000Z	CarlK	Servo888	- but all of that assumes you A) have a 2nd box to setup the servers, and B) the 24meg box can do netboot, which if it is a laptop, i doubt
2005-04-23T11:38:00.000Z	Servo888	CarlK	the only problem with that is that I'm at school right now. All I have is my good laptop (the one im typing this up), and the 24mb crummy laptop next to it... No access to cdr's (just wasted my last one...). And no crossover cable. So I guess I'll try to do something tonight when I get home.
2005-04-23T11:43:00.000Z	CarlK	Servo888	- hang on a sec... somewhere is a Low mem install notes
2005-04-23T12:03:00.000Z	Servo888	CarlK	lol, yah I found that lowmem install as well - never new 256MB was low ram =\
