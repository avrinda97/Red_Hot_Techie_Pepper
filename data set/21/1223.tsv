2011-03-20T05:25:00.000Z	induz	mongy	 its not copy and paste as its a bootable CD so some files are hiden  i guess
2011-03-20T05:25:00.000Z	mongy	induz	I didnt say copy paste.
2011-03-20T05:26:00.000Z	mongy	induz	brasero can copy to iso
2011-03-20T05:29:00.000Z	mongy	induz	you only need 'clonecd' to copy protected cd
2011-03-20T05:30:00.000Z	mongy	induz	brasero can copy a bootable cd fine.
2011-03-20T05:32:00.000Z	mongy	induz	as far as copying a bootable cd goes, k9copy does nothing different.
2011-03-20T05:33:00.000Z	mongy	induz	but, your choice.
2011-03-20T05:34:00.000Z	mongy	induz	cloning is raw...  you only need to do a raw copy for things you shouldnt be copying.
2011-03-20T05:34:00.000Z	mongy	induz	bootable isnt something voodoo you need to 'clone'
2011-03-20T05:35:00.000Z	mongy	induz	its upto you man.  I use ubuntu built-in.
2011-03-20T05:35:00.000Z	induz	mongy	i have a bootbale CD and its Old, i want to make a same copy/clone od that CD media
2011-03-20T05:36:00.000Z	induz	mongy	i am trying to understand here
2011-03-20T05:36:00.000Z	mongy	induz	so right click it and choose copy disc.  unless its some protected game/dvd
2011-03-20T05:37:00.000Z	induz	mongy	its not protected but its Xp cd
2011-03-20T05:37:00.000Z	mongy	induz	 so just do what I said.
2011-03-20T05:38:00.000Z	mongy	induz	and use your legal serial
