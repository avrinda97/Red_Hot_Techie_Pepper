2009-09-13T00:35:00.000Z	Gogge		Ok, now Im in big trouble, I really desperately need help... I cannot boot from my disc which means I can use LIVE CD or Vista Recovery disc to fix my busted bootloader, coz right now all I get is GRUB error 17
2009-09-13T00:36:00.000Z	Gogge		my CD/DVD drive works. i could use it when i was in windows, but I cannot see it in the selection list of boot order
2009-09-13T00:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gogge	boot order???
2009-09-13T00:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gogge	your bios?
2009-09-13T00:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gogge	what exactly is wrong with the boot loader?
2009-09-13T00:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gogge	right let's see if I can help you or not now,  can you repeate the whole of your issue?
2009-09-13T00:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gogge	ok I know what's happpended
2009-09-13T00:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gogge	there's that tiny little bit of Grub left on the MBR   which now can't boot anything up, because  when you removed the partition for Kubuntu   you also removed /boot
2009-09-13T00:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gogge	so to sort this out you can for example re install Ubuntu :) and let it put Grub back on :)
2009-09-13T00:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gogge	or  put in a Windows CD/DVD and let it go over the MBR
2009-09-13T00:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gogge	repair Windows is the option I think that will do that
2009-09-13T00:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gogge	oh
2009-09-13T03:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gogge	Ext4 will be the default in 9.10 :)  and  that's  much faster for boot up and that then Ext3,  it's a little bit hmm in 9.04 though
2009-09-13T03:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gogge	depends
2009-09-13T03:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gogge	Ext4 maybe, but many people woudn't recommend it for 9.04,  but that also means you got to clean install when 9.10  comes out,  unless the Ext3 to Ext4 conversion will be good enough  then hmm
2009-09-13T03:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gogge	Ext4 in 9.04 will probably be ok, as long as you got any important data backed up just to be 100% sure, and you should be backing up anyway, because hard disks can just fail and such
2009-09-13T03:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gogge	a lockup issue when deleting big files from Ext4 in 9.04 maybe, but other then that, should be fine
2009-09-13T03:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gogge	ok 9.04 with Ext3, and then clean install when 9.10 comes out and do the Ext4, this makes sense
2009-09-13T03:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gogge	why are you doing manual partitoning anyway?
2009-09-13T03:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gogge	see my pm
2009-09-13T03:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Gogge	it's a good idea to also have a seperate /home
