2007-03-07T12:59:00.000Z	ikonia	denis_on_ubuntu	firefox 1.5 is the latest current on ubuntu 6.0.6
2007-03-07T12:59:00.000Z	ikonia	denis_on_ubuntu	not from the ubuntu repo's
2007-03-09T15:05:00.000Z	ikonia	denis_on_ubuntu	follow that link, don't worry about re-compiling kernels etc etc
2007-03-09T15:05:00.000Z	denis_on_ubuntu	ikonia	i have nvidia drivers installed
2007-03-09T15:06:00.000Z	ikonia	denis_on_ubuntu	whats the problem ?
2007-03-09T15:06:00.000Z	ikonia	denis_on_ubuntu	sorry I must have missed the link, it took me to an nvidia question
2007-03-09T15:07:00.000Z	ikonia	denis_on_ubuntu	you'll get better help on the ubuntu forums, as thats ubuntu focused rather than generic linux distros
2007-03-09T15:07:00.000Z	ikonia	denis_on_ubuntu	then post a question on the forum
2007-03-09T15:16:00.000Z	ikonia	denis_on_ubuntu	well you should get both from the ubuntu repo's so - it shouldn't be a problem
2007-03-09T15:16:00.000Z	ikonia	denis_on_ubuntu	why do you want to
2007-03-09T15:17:00.000Z	ikonia	denis_on_ubuntu	use the versions from the ubuntu repo's and you'll know they match
2007-03-09T15:18:00.000Z	ikonia	denis_on_ubuntu	the ubuntu teams make sure the package versions are compatible, just trust them
2007-03-09T15:20:00.000Z	ikonia	denis_on_ubuntu	did you attempt to get any packages from anywhere other than the ubuntu repo's
2007-03-09T15:20:00.000Z	ikonia	denis_on_ubuntu	then you're screwed
2007-03-09T15:21:00.000Z	ikonia	denis_on_ubuntu	you'd installed broke ndiswapper softare
2007-03-09T15:21:00.000Z	ikonia	denis_on_ubuntu	you didn't install as a package so you can't remove easy so you'll have to re-install
2007-03-09T15:22:00.000Z	ikonia	denis_on_ubuntu	then next time follow information from ubuntu sources
2007-03-09T15:23:00.000Z	ikonia	denis_on_ubuntu	rather then random website
