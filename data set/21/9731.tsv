2006-11-13T06:40:00.000Z	variant	dk0r	no, 100% proprietry
2006-11-13T06:41:00.000Z	dk0r	variant	Welcome to Linux.
2006-11-13T06:41:00.000Z	variant	dk0r	what?
2006-11-13T06:41:00.000Z	variant	dk0r	what are you talking about?
2006-11-13T06:41:00.000Z	dk0r	variant	You said the are non-free
2006-11-13T06:41:00.000Z	variant	dk0r	you can download them free of charge, they are not free software though
2006-11-13T06:42:00.000Z	dk0r	variant	How can you get an app for free, yet it not be free of charge?
2006-11-13T06:42:00.000Z	variant	dk0r	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software
2006-11-13T06:43:00.000Z	variant	dk0r	the free refers to "freedom" not price, free software can cost money. when people talk of "free and open source software" they are mixing terms
2006-11-13T06:43:00.000Z	variant	dk0r	open source software doesnt have to be free[dom]  but it _should_ be
2006-11-13T06:44:00.000Z	dk0r	variant	 Gotcha. Thanks.
2006-11-13T06:44:00.000Z	variant	dk0r	like, some windows source code is available but you have to sign a non disclosure agreement to see it.. definatly not free
2006-11-13T06:44:00.000Z	dk0r	variant	Free depends on your definition of cost.
2006-11-13T06:45:00.000Z	variant	dk0r	the word free when talking about "free software" has nothing whatsoeverto do with the cost of the software.. it should be called freedom software but that sounds dumb
