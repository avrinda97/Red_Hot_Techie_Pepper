2009-08-02T07:47:00.000Z	Surlent777	nanotube	THE SIMPLE THINGS ARE ESCAPING ME TONIGHT =(
2009-08-02T07:48:00.000Z	nanotube	Surlent777	hehe
2009-08-02T07:49:00.000Z	nanotube	Surlent777	eh, it doesn't work, it seems :(
2009-08-02T08:07:00.000Z	nanotube	Surlent777	well, a tty is any terminal emulator. run "tty" from a gnome-terminal, itll tell you the device for it, too...
2009-08-02T08:07:00.000Z	nanotube	Surlent777	hehe
2009-08-02T08:00:00.000Z	nanotube	Surlent777	screen rocks. :) i use it when sshing to remote machines.
2009-08-02T08:00:00.000Z	Surlent777	nanotube	I use it for irssi. In fact, I'm using it now in a TTY
2009-08-02T08:00:00.000Z	nanotube	Surlent777	heh ic
2009-08-02T08:00:00.000Z	nanotube	Surlent777	i'm an xchat guy when it comes to irc... :)
2009-08-02T08:01:00.000Z	nanotube	Surlent777	oh, you already said that ;)
2009-08-02T08:03:00.000Z	nanotube	Surlent777	hehe, even better is running cat /dev/random in a terminal ehhe
2009-08-02T08:05:00.000Z	nanotube	Surlent777	those terminals i think are called "vty" for "virtual terminal"...
2009-08-02T08:05:00.000Z	nanotube	Surlent777	all others are just terminals :)
2009-08-02T08:06:00.000Z	Surlent777	nanotube	your cat command is awesome =D
2009-08-02T08:09:00.000Z	Surlent777	nanotube	tty prints the file name of the terminal connected to standard input. I don't think that means that a tty is a terminal emulator in general, but this is all admittedly obscure and confusing
2009-08-02T08:09:00.000Z	nanotube	Surlent777	even better is /dev/urandom, produces more of the good stuff. :)
2009-08-02T08:10:00.000Z	Surlent777	nanotube	noted. I actually did that instead of /random cause I misread your post
