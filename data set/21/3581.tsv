2011-01-12T06:48:00.000Z	Haunt_House	kwtm	good to know, thank you
2011-01-12T06:47:00.000Z	kwtm	Haunt_House	KDE applications need the KDE libraries installed, but these are part of Ubuntu, so when you installed Dolphin, it installed the necessary KDE libraries so it should work fine.
2011-01-12T11:42:00.000Z	kwtm	Haunt_House	I'm not sure what "the starter" is (presumably some GNOME Ubuntu thing --I use Kubuntu KDE), but have you tried /usr/bin/python instead of just "python"?
2011-01-12T11:43:00.000Z	Haunt_House	kwtm	starter is a clickable icon
2011-01-12T11:43:00.000Z	kwtm	Haunt_House	Well, you're really trying to run /usr/bin/python, not /bin/sh, right?
2011-01-12T11:43:00.000Z	Haunt_House	kwtm	basically I try to change my desktop background at startup, but I'm working my way there
2011-01-12T11:44:00.000Z	Haunt_House	kwtm	I included that lin in the actual script
2011-01-12T11:45:00.000Z	kwtm	Haunt_House	Are you sure a script at startup is the best way to do it?  Anyway, assuming that it is ... it sounds like "starter" is the menu system in (GNOME) Ubuntu?  Or do you have an actual desktop icon called "starter"?  If either one, I might be able to help; if "starter" is a non-menu desktop icon that came with Ubuntu already, I'd have to profess ignorance since I use KDE.
2011-01-12T11:46:00.000Z	kwtm	Haunt_House	well, not the actual script, but what command are you trying to run from "starter"?  If your *script* starts with "#!/usr/bin/python", that doesn't matter since only bash or some other console will read that line.  Does "starter" read that line?
2011-01-12T11:48:00.000Z	kwtm	Haunt_House	As an example, if I install a new menu item (under my Kubuntu) then I'd have to say:  run the command '/usr/bin/python /path/to/myscript.py'.  It might not be enough to say: run the command '/path/to/myscript' or the command 'python /path/to/myscript'  (even if my script starts with "#!/usr/bin/python")
2011-01-12T11:48:00.000Z	Haunt_House	kwtm	I tried several approaches. right now I tried running it directly with 'python /path/script.py' and via a shellscript running script.py. both solutions work in the console, none work otherwise
2011-01-12T11:50:00.000Z	kwtm	Haunt_House	Hmm... sorry, sounds like your query is specific to GNOME Ubuntu so I won't be able to help you.
2011-01-12T11:51:00.000Z	Haunt_House	kwtm	dunno, at least I got the button to say permission denied
2011-01-12T11:53:00.000Z	kwtm	Haunt_House	Of course!  actionparsnip has a point --is your script executable?  By all?  That must be the cause of the "permission denied" message.
2011-01-12T12:01:00.000Z	kwtm	Haunt_House	Not if you run it from the command line.  If it's some other program (e.g. "starter"), not so sure.
2011-01-12T12:13:00.000Z	kwtm	Haunt_House	Oh!! I see now; the "permission denied" was not for the script itself; the script was executing and the "permission denied" error was generated by the script, then!
2011-01-12T12:14:00.000Z	kwtm	Haunt_House	Note for the future: your environment is not necessarily inherited when you run the script, so $PATH etc. may be different.  I see a lot of people run python scripts not with "#!/usr/bin/python" but with "#!/usr/bin/env python".  But that doesn't always work, either, so set your $PYTHONPATH and $PATH.
2011-01-12T12:14:00.000Z	kwtm	Haunt_House	and $PWD, too.
2011-01-12T12:14:00.000Z	Haunt_House	kwtm	starter works now and maybe it'll work at boot. Thank you both, kwtm  and soreau. If you want, I'll put you on the thanks list when my live action series starts
2011-01-12T12:15:00.000Z	kwtm	Haunt_House	Live action?  Is that, like, Spongebob Squarepants using real actors instead of cartoon?
2011-01-12T12:16:00.000Z	Haunt_House	kwtm	yes, but with actors instead of spongebob
