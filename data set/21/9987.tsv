2005-06-19T09:51:00.000Z	toshiba_		Any ideas why the following command doesn't work for me?: cat /proc/cpufreq
2005-06-19T09:52:00.000Z	Seveas	toshiba_	maybe your processor does not support it...
2005-06-19T09:52:00.000Z	toshiba_	Seveas	Pentium-M.
2005-06-19T09:52:00.000Z	Seveas	toshiba_	have you installed linux-686
2005-06-19T09:52:00.000Z	toshiba_	Seveas	Yes.
2005-06-19T09:53:00.000Z	Seveas	toshiba_	weird, same setup here and works fine
2005-06-19T09:53:00.000Z	toshiba_	Seveas	cpufredq now works.. but can't use that cmd.. no, not on warty..
2005-06-19T09:54:00.000Z	Seveas	toshiba_	you do not need cpufreqd
2005-06-19T09:54:00.000Z	toshiba_	Seveas	is it normal that I don't even have a /proc folder?
2005-06-19T09:54:00.000Z	Seveas	toshiba_	wtf??
2005-06-19T09:54:00.000Z	toshiba_	Seveas	nvrmind, i do :P
2005-06-19T09:54:00.000Z	toshiba_	Seveas	but no /cpufreq :(
2005-06-19T09:55:00.000Z	Seveas	toshiba_	maybe cpufreqd screws that up for you, you don't need cpufreqd anyway
2005-06-19T09:56:00.000Z	toshiba_	Seveas	i don't...? hm.
2005-06-19T09:56:00.000Z	Seveas	toshiba_	no
2005-06-19T09:57:00.000Z	toshiba_	Seveas	the cpu freq applet didnt really work till i install cpufreqd
2005-06-19T09:57:00.000Z	toshiba_	Seveas	removed now.. will restart n see.
2005-06-19T15:09:00.000Z	Seveas	toshiba_	some movies have that, try another movie...
2005-06-19T15:09:00.000Z	toshiba_	Seveas	um, all quicktime movie giving that.
2005-06-19T15:09:00.000Z	Seveas	toshiba_	hmm, do you have a quicktime codec installed?
2005-06-19T15:10:00.000Z	toshiba_	Seveas	pretty sure, cos mplayer loads when i want to watch a quicktime movie in firefox..
