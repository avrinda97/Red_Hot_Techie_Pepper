2008-11-27T22:53:00.000Z	forcumang	Dark_Wolf	=> have you tried rebooting?
2008-11-27T22:54:00.000Z	Dark_Wolf	forcumang	I just booted
2008-11-27T22:54:00.000Z	Dark_Wolf		and rebooting would require disconnecting from here
2008-11-27T22:54:00.000Z	forcumang	Dark_Wolf	=> not if you had another computer, anyways
2008-11-27T22:54:00.000Z	forcumang	Dark_Wolf	=> obviously it's not your net, so your repos have to be misconfigured
2008-11-27T22:55:00.000Z	Dark_Wolf		:/
2008-11-27T22:55:00.000Z	Dark_Wolf		any ideas?
2008-11-27T22:55:00.000Z	forcumang	Dark_Wolf	=> unless you have <128KBs net
2008-11-27T22:55:00.000Z	forcumang		that would explain the 10KB/s
2008-11-27T22:57:00.000Z	Dark_Wolf	forcumang	I'm on 31.1 Kbps
2008-11-27T22:57:00.000Z	forcumang	Dark_Wolf	=> that explains the 10KB/s connection...
2008-11-27T22:57:00.000Z	forcumang		what is the problem...
2008-11-27T22:58:00.000Z	forcumang	Dark_Wolf	=> the reason your install is not going past 10KB/s, is your net connection, nothing else.
2008-11-27T22:58:00.000Z	Dark_Wolf		yes... what IS the problem?
2008-11-27T22:58:00.000Z	forcumang	Dark_Wolf	=> your connection is
2008-11-27T22:58:00.000Z	Dark_Wolf	forcumang	I don't care about speed. it's the fact that nothing connects that bothers me
2008-11-27T22:59:00.000Z	Dark_Wolf		I can't get into the synaptic
2008-11-27T22:59:00.000Z	Dark_Wolf		or get restricted drivers
2008-11-27T22:59:00.000Z	forcumang	Dark_Wolf	=> seeing as irc takes less than 1KBs to use, it could just be the fact that your connection line doesn't reach the repos
2008-11-27T23:00:00.000Z	Dark_Wolf	forcumang	I've always had access to repos at this speed
2008-11-27T23:02:00.000Z	forcumang	Dark_Wolf	=> the only advice i can give on that, is reboot, sorry i couldn't help
