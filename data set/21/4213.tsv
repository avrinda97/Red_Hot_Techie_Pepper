2009-07-30T03:42:00.000Z	verb_	mechtech	I think bittorrent connections don't use DNS lookup as they are all IP based
2009-07-30T03:43:00.000Z	mechtech	verb_	basically I don't want my ISP spying on my bittorrent traffic
2009-07-30T03:43:00.000Z	verb_	mechtech	use encryption
2009-07-30T03:44:00.000Z	mechtech	verb_	know a good how-to on that?
2009-07-30T03:44:00.000Z	verb_	mechtech	depends on what torrent client you use
2009-07-30T03:44:00.000Z	mechtech	verb_	willing to use any, but currently using transmission
2009-07-30T03:45:00.000Z	verb_	mechtech	not really sure about transmission, you can google it. I know that utorrent and deluge have encryption
2009-07-30T03:45:00.000Z	mechtech	verb_	I love utorrent...they have that for linux?
2009-07-30T03:46:00.000Z	verb_	mechtech	it runs perfectly on wine
2009-07-30T03:46:00.000Z	verb_	mechtech	better than deluge and transmission even
2009-07-30T03:46:00.000Z	mechtech	verb_	ok...I'll keep that in mind...trying to go native linux as much as possible...don't wanna rely on any MS software
2009-07-30T03:46:00.000Z	mechtech	verb_	anymore
2009-07-30T03:47:00.000Z	verb_	mechtech	use deluge then, it's easy
2009-07-30T03:47:00.000Z	mechtech	verb_	thanks, I'll check that out
2009-07-30T03:47:00.000Z	verb_	mechtech	no problem
2009-07-30T03:51:00.000Z	verb_	mechtech	1312 people in this channel and most don't help :(
2009-07-30T03:52:00.000Z	mechtech	verb_	what's wrong?
2009-07-30T03:52:00.000Z	verb_	mechtech	my system broke after update
