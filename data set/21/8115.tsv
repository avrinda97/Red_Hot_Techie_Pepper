2008-01-24T03:01:00.000Z	oreth		Firefox locks everytime i watch a youtube/flashplayer video
2008-01-24T03:01:00.000Z	MrObvious	oreth	Gnash or Adobe flash?
2008-01-24T03:03:00.000Z	MrObvious	oreth	Whoops I'm misspelling your name sorry.
2008-01-24T03:03:00.000Z	oreth	MrObvious	no biggy
2008-01-24T03:04:00.000Z	oreth	MrObvious	gnash was not installed
2008-01-24T03:04:00.000Z	MrObvious	oreth	Hmm.
2008-01-24T03:04:00.000Z	oreth	MrObvious	I installed flash by having Firefox install it automatically
2008-01-24T03:05:00.000Z	MrObvious	oreth	Try the factoid that ubotu PMed you. It'll give you a link to fix it then.
2008-01-24T03:07:00.000Z	MrObvious	oreth	You getting it?
2008-01-24T03:11:00.000Z	oreth	MrObvious	it worked to install alsa-oss and set firefox to use that sound plugin
2008-01-24T03:12:00.000Z	MrObvious	oreth	Glad it works. YW
2008-01-26T22:38:00.000Z	MrObvious	oreth	sudo chown -R oreth.oreth /home/oreth/.wine
2008-01-26T22:38:00.000Z	MrObvious	oreth	man chown
2008-01-26T22:43:00.000Z	oreth	MrObvious	I attempted to change the owner.. and perhaps it worked
2008-01-26T22:43:00.000Z	MrObvious	oreth	Rut roh.
2008-01-26T22:45:00.000Z	MrObvious	oreth	I would make it +r (chmod -R +r ~/.wine) and see if that helps.
2008-01-26T22:47:00.000Z	MrObvious	oreth	I wonder if chmod 777 ~/.wine would fix it. Do you have anything installed in ~/.wine?
2008-01-26T22:48:00.000Z	oreth	MrObvious	that did something :P
2008-01-26T22:48:00.000Z	MrObvious	oreth	It did? I thought it would.
2008-01-26T22:51:00.000Z	MrObvious	oreth	If it were me I'd just delete the whole ~/.wine and reinstall anything I have in there and start over, but that might not work for you. Did you do chmod 777 ~/.wine or chmod -R 777 ~/.wine ?
2008-01-26T22:55:00.000Z	MrObvious	oreth	That would still retain permission problems.
