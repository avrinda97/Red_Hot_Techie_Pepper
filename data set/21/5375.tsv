2007-10-30T19:05:00.000Z	bachstudies	Lawke	I also have a dell 1501 running 7.10. Have you got wireless working at full speed or is it still at 24mb/s
2007-10-30T19:06:00.000Z	Lawke	bachstudies	I don't think it working at full speed, if I go to the upper floor, I don't get any internet at all!
2007-10-30T19:06:00.000Z	Lawke	bachstudies	what drivers do you use for your wireless card?
2007-10-30T19:07:00.000Z	bachstudies	Lawke	I am using the restricted drivers as ubuntu suggests
2007-10-30T19:07:00.000Z	Lawke	bachstudies	same here...
2007-10-30T19:07:00.000Z	Lawke		i'm glad it works tho
2007-10-30T19:07:00.000Z	bachstudies	Lawke	i've used SLED with my dell as well and after a bit of tweaking the wireless works full speed
2007-10-30T19:08:00.000Z	Lawke	bachstudies	do you have it at full speed now?
2007-10-30T19:08:00.000Z	bachstudies	Lawke	not in ubuntu 7.10
2007-10-30T19:08:00.000Z	Lawke		ic
2007-10-30T19:08:00.000Z	Lawke		you think there will be upgrades soon or anything?
2007-10-30T19:09:00.000Z	bachstudies	Lawke	i'm giving up on it...just going to run xp on it i think
2007-10-30T19:09:00.000Z	Lawke	bachstudies	where can I see the speed of the wireless?
2007-10-30T19:09:00.000Z	bachstudies	Lawke	by right clicking on the wireless icon in the right hand corner i think
2007-10-30T19:09:00.000Z	bachstudies	Lawke	hit connection information
2007-10-30T19:10:00.000Z	Lawke	bachstudies	your right, 24mbit here to :(
2007-10-30T19:11:00.000Z	bachstudies	Lawke	not nice to say on ubuntu chat but try suse 10.3 or SLED
2007-10-30T19:11:00.000Z	Lawke		but this is so pretty :)
