2010-07-21T19:37:00.000Z	rallias		is it possible to set apt-get to install data in a users directory?
2010-07-21T19:38:00.000Z	rallias		how long does mingw usually take to install from the .sh file?
2010-07-21T19:40:00.000Z	clusterfusk	rallias	this is not recommended because the package manager doesn't know about these programs, but some programs will work if you extract the package to a user directory with file-roller.
2010-07-21T19:42:00.000Z	clusterfusk	rallias	also make sure to set $PATH to the user's bin directory in .bashrc
2010-07-21T19:43:00.000Z	clusterfusk	rallias	my web server does this because I share a server with a few other websites.
2010-07-21T19:56:00.000Z	clusterfusk	rallias	evolutiion should ask for it...
2010-07-21T19:56:00.000Z	rallias	clusterfusk	it isn't
2010-07-21T19:57:00.000Z	clusterfusk	rallias	what have you done so far?
2010-07-21T20:00:00.000Z	clusterfusk	rallias	run seahorse to see if there's already an entry for your email account.
2010-07-21T20:01:00.000Z	clusterfusk	rallias	hit ctrl+F2 and type "seahorse"
2010-07-21T20:01:00.000Z	clusterfusk	rallias	It shows you your stored passwords
2010-07-21T20:02:00.000Z	rallias	clusterfusk	there isn't an entry.
2010-07-21T20:03:00.000Z	clusterfusk	rallias	have you confirmed that your account information was entered correctly in evolution's preferences?
2010-07-21T20:05:00.000Z	clusterfusk	rallias	It sounds like you haven't entered the right server information.  Check your preferences
2010-07-21T20:05:00.000Z	rallias	clusterfusk	i checked the preferences. It doesn't have a password, it never asked for one
2010-07-21T20:07:00.000Z	clusterfusk	rallias	I DID NOT SAY PASSWORD.  Check your SERVER information.  If you enter the correct server information, Evolutions prompts for a password when you check for new mail.
2010-07-21T20:08:00.000Z	clusterfusk	rallias	what mail server are you trying to connect to?
2010-07-21T20:08:00.000Z	rallias	clusterfusk	the server info is correct.
2010-07-21T20:08:00.000Z	rallias	clusterfusk	localhost port 1080
2010-07-21T20:09:00.000Z	rallias	clusterfusk	i telnetted it today and have not cut it off yet
2010-07-21T20:10:00.000Z	clusterfusk	rallias	sounds to me like it's a problem with your mail server.  Evolution is pretty straightforward.
