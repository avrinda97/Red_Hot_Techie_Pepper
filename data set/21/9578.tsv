2005-08-28T06:06:00.000Z	kemik	can-o-worms	 use "fdisk -l" to see where you're partitons are located
2005-08-28T06:08:00.000Z	can-o-worms	kemik	I'll remember that, i usually just look at the dev files
2005-08-28T06:09:00.000Z	kemik	can-o-worms	 its a nice command ;)
2005-08-28T06:11:00.000Z	can-o-worms	kemik	that is sweet, it shows you a whole lot of cool stuff... thanks
2005-08-29T15:43:00.000Z	kemik	can-o-worms	 well your sambashare seem to work aswell since you can acces it from windows/linux ;)
2005-08-29T15:43:00.000Z	kemik	can-o-worms	 but it does seem strange
2005-08-29T15:43:00.000Z	can-o-worms	kemik	it is really strange... it actually locks finder up
2005-08-29T15:44:00.000Z	kemik	can-o-worms	 maybe you mistyped the adress? or blokcing the OSX machine in a firewall ?
2005-08-29T15:45:00.000Z	can-o-worms	kemik	i am just doubling clicking the icon in osx, and there is no firewall, the gentoo box is 192.168.0.8 and ubuntu is 192.168.0.6
2005-08-29T15:45:00.000Z	can-o-worms	kemik	do you have an osx box?
2005-08-29T15:46:00.000Z	kemik	can-o-worms	 so the share "appears" on the network, but trying to access it hangs you OSX application (finder)
2005-08-29T15:46:00.000Z	kemik	can-o-worms	 luckily no ;) hehe
2005-08-29T15:46:00.000Z	can-o-worms	kemik	exactly... but windows and another ubuntu box have no problem with it
2005-08-29T15:47:00.000Z	kemik	can-o-worms	 gentoo and ubuntu using hte same version of samba?
2005-08-29T15:47:00.000Z	can-o-worms	kemik	not exactly, i tried copying the config file straight over and had a few problems
2005-08-29T15:48:00.000Z	can-o-worms	kemik	but the actually share part is the same.... the global has a couple of different parts
2005-08-29T15:48:00.000Z	can-o-worms	kemik	do you use samba?
2005-08-29T15:49:00.000Z	kemik	can-o-worms	 not much these days.. since i've migrated all my computers to debian / ubuntu .. but sometimes i dualboot this one to windows... so yes i use samba but mostly NFS
2005-08-29T15:52:00.000Z	can-o-worms	kemik	it is just that the unbuntu starter guide talks about using a smbusers file, but i just use smbpasswd file
2005-08-29T15:55:00.000Z	kemik	can-o-worms	 dont know what can be causing you problems really. could be a bug, bad-config etc..  :/
2005-08-29T15:57:00.000Z	can-o-worms	kemik	yeah... thanks for your time... thoreauputic might know something
