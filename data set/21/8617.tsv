2006-08-28T15:27:00.000Z	uri		so I think that you would need to do the same, allow it to be read and executed

2006-08-28T15:28:00.000Z	uri	zoidberg	well you need to open a command line
2006-08-28T15:29:00.000Z	zoidberg		uri:and...?
2006-08-28T15:29:00.000Z	uri		go to the folder where you saved the script
2006-08-28T15:29:00.000Z	uri		change the permission to be +rx
