2012-03-29T05:00:00.000Z	JJC		Can someone help me with building drivers for my TV card? My card is supported, but when I try to build the driver, it stops due to an error.

2012-03-29T05:05:00.000Z	JJC	qubit[0|1]	That's where it stops.
2012-03-29T05:06:00.000Z	qubit[0|1]	JJC	yeah not much there, you'll probably have to search if kmap_atomic has changed recently , is what you're building for 2.6 or 3.0 ?
2012-03-29T05:06:00.000Z	qubit[0|1]	JJC	what are you building ?
2012-03-29T05:07:00.000Z	JJC	qubit[0|1]	I'm building the driver for my TV card.
2012-03-29T05:07:00.000Z	qubit[0|1]		oh right :)
2012-03-29T05:08:00.000Z	JJC	qubit[0|1]	Sorry, I'm very new to Linux, what do you mean for 2.6 or 3.0?
2012-03-29T05:09:00.000Z	qubit[0|1]	JJC	 if I had to guess , you're building a program that was built for the kernel 2.6 on the 3.0 kernel, kmap that deals with kernel virtual memory
2012-03-29T05:09:00.000Z	qubit[0|1]	JJC	what version of ubuntu are you using ?
2012-03-29T05:09:00.000Z	qubit[0|1]	JJC	also where did you get this code ?
2012-03-29T05:09:00.000Z	JJC	qubit[0|1]	10.04
2012-03-29T05:10:00.000Z	JJC	qubit[0|1]	The command I'm using?
2012-03-29T05:10:00.000Z	qubit[0|1]		what are you building ?
2012-03-29T05:11:00.000Z	JJC	qubit[0|1]	Here is the guide I'm following. http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/How_to_Obtain,_Build_and_Install_V4L-DVB_Device_Drivers
2012-03-29T05:13:00.000Z	qubit[0|1]	JJC	found this, http://lwn.net/Articles/356378/ , but it looks like a serious pain in the ass - somewhere along the line the function kmap() changed
2012-03-29T05:16:00.000Z	JJC	qubit[0|1]	I wouldn't have a clue how to do any of those steps...
