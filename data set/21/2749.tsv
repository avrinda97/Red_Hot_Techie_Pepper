2009-07-04T03:00:00.000Z	BornRebel		I just installed ubuntu 9.04 on a seperate partition from windows 7 which was already on the computer but grub wont recognize and let me boot into windows 7
2009-07-04T03:00:00.000Z	Halitech	BornRebel	can you see the windows partition from Ubuntu?
2009-07-04T03:01:00.000Z	BornRebel	Halitech	where would i go to check that?
2009-07-04T03:02:00.000Z	Halitech	BornRebel	look under places I believe
2009-07-04T03:03:00.000Z	Halitech	BornRebel	was Windows installed first and then you installed Ubuntu?
2009-07-04T03:03:00.000Z	Halitech	BornRebel	and grub does come up to load Ubuntu?
2009-07-04T03:04:00.000Z	BornRebel	Halitech	yes i choose from ubuntu and ubuntu recovery mode and an unidentified operating system i think its called
2009-07-04T03:07:00.000Z	Halitech	BornRebel	ok, use pastebin to give us the output of sudo fdisk -l and cat /boot/grub/menu.lst
2009-07-04T03:09:00.000Z	BornRebel	Halitech	i put sudo fdisk -l and cat /boot/grub/menu.lst into terminal? i did that and it just asked for password and did nothing
2009-07-04T03:09:00.000Z	Halitech	BornRebel	did you put the password in and hit enter? you won't see it do anything until you hit enter
2009-07-04T03:11:00.000Z	Halitech	BornRebel	are you using a lowercase L or the number after after fdisk?
2009-07-04T03:11:00.000Z	Halitech	BornRebel	sorry, meant the number 1?
2009-07-04T03:12:00.000Z	BornRebel	Halitech	i Copied and pasted what u typed, this   sudo fdisk -l and cat /boot/grub/menu.lst
2009-07-04T03:12:00.000Z	Halitech	BornRebel	you need to do them as seperate commands
2009-07-04T03:13:00.000Z	Halitech	BornRebel	so first do sudo fdisk -l , wait for the results then do cat /boot/grub/menu.lst
2009-07-04T03:15:00.000Z	BornRebel	Halitech	heres the link http://pastebin.ca/1483428
2009-07-04T03:19:00.000Z	Halitech	BornRebel	I *think* where it says rootnoverify    (hd0,0) it should be 0,2 as grub starts at 0,0 for the first disk first partition and I'm guessing Windows is at sda2
2009-07-04T03:20:00.000Z	BornRebel	Halitech	i dunno what sda2 is but i think sad6 is windows 7
2009-07-04T03:23:00.000Z	Halitech	BornRebel	ok, try 0,4 in the grub menu and see if Windows will boot
2009-07-04T03:24:00.000Z	Halitech	BornRebel	gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
2009-07-04T03:28:00.000Z	Halitech	BornRebel	no problem, hopefully it works
