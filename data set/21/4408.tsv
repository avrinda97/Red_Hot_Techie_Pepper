2008-05-10T22:22:00.000Z	mehrab		I can't upload any file to a web host. does this relate to ubuntu? any Idea?
2008-05-10T22:23:00.000Z	babolat	mehrab	probably not, but hard to say when no other detail is provided ;)
2008-05-10T22:24:00.000Z	mehrab	babolat	tell if any detail is needed?
2008-05-10T22:24:00.000Z	babolat	mehrab	indeed more detail is needed
2008-05-10T22:25:00.000Z	mehrab	babolat	sorry, but I dont know what details should I say.
2008-05-10T22:26:00.000Z	babolat	mehrab	how do you upload to your host? FTP? what error prompt do you get when trying to upload?
2008-05-10T22:27:00.000Z	mehrab	babolat	no, I upload through web browser. and I want to upload to mediafire, 4shared and s.th like these
2008-05-10T22:28:00.000Z	babolat	mehrab	that sounds like an Internet service issue. has this kind of problem ever presented itself in the past?
2008-05-10T22:30:00.000Z	mehrab	babolat	no, never had such a problem. but now I have this problem for 4 days. checked with firefox and konqueror and the result was the same
2008-05-10T22:30:00.000Z	babolat	mehrab	can you successfully load the host's Website?
2008-05-10T22:31:00.000Z	mehrab	babolat	mediafire give this error : ERROR: Invalid key state, no status
2008-05-10T22:31:00.000Z	mehrab	babolat	yes
2008-05-10T22:32:00.000Z	babolat	mehrab	perhaps the service is down?
2008-05-10T22:32:00.000Z	mehrab	babolat	I tried with other services too
2008-05-10T22:33:00.000Z	babolat	mehrab	other services as in other sites? and you get the same prompt, or you just can't upload files?
2008-05-10T22:34:00.000Z	mehrab	babolat	yes, other sites, and the upload progress stays in 1% in all of them
2008-05-10T22:36:00.000Z	babolat	mehrab	what's the size of your files? because that sounds like RTO due to limits set by hosts
2008-05-10T22:37:00.000Z	mehrab	babolat	just 6 mb. I've uploaded 50mb files before on mediafire
2008-05-10T22:39:00.000Z	babolat	mehrab	i can't turn up anything from here. it may be that your ISP blocked the service
2008-05-10T22:41:00.000Z	mehrab	babolat	I have upload with bittorrent client. anyway, thank you. I should call the ISP I think
2008-05-10T22:42:00.000Z	babolat	mehrab	bittorrent? that would take quite some time. you might want to look into free webhosts instead. but do call your ISP
