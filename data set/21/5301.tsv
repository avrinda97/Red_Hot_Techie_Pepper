2007-11-16T03:19:00.000Z	rinaldi_	greencookie	hey iv been having problems with wg111v2, any luck wit yours?
2007-11-16T03:20:00.000Z	greencookie	rinaldi_	I'm about to take out my sledgehammer and beat the crap out of that little sucker!
2007-11-16T03:20:00.000Z	greencookie	rinaldi_	I've been at it all night yesterday and all day today. Believe me, no breaks, not even lunch. Im about to lose it:)
2007-11-16T03:21:00.000Z	rinaldi_	greencookie	well mine works fine on desktop but my laptop will only connect it about a metre away, kinda defeats the point of the laptoop being prtable
2007-11-16T03:21:00.000Z	greencookie	rinaldi_	Lol.
2007-11-16T03:21:00.000Z	greencookie	rinaldi_	Whatever you do DONT install ndiswrapper, unless ure an expert at that kind of stuff.
2007-11-16T03:21:00.000Z	rinaldi_	greencookie	what was your problem?
2007-11-16T03:22:00.000Z	greencookie	rinaldi_	my wg111v2 was working fine in ubuntu.
2007-11-16T03:22:00.000Z	greencookie	rinaldi_	the only problem that it had was periodically the network would freeze and in order to get reconnected I would have to restart my computer.
2007-11-16T03:22:00.000Z	greencookie	rinaldi_	so yesterday I installed ndiswrapper
2007-11-16T03:23:00.000Z	rinaldi_	greencookie	are you running 7.10?
2007-11-16T03:23:00.000Z	greencookie	rinaldi_	yes.
2007-11-16T03:23:00.000Z	greencookie	rinaldi_	but ndiswrapper just made problems worse. now i cant even scan my networks
2007-11-16T03:23:00.000Z	rinaldi_	greencookie	i had the same problem with my desktop until i upgraded to 7.10
2007-11-16T03:24:00.000Z	rinaldi_	greencookie	someone taught me to use another script instead of the nm applet in the top tray and on my laptop it works a bit better, its called wpa_supplicant
2007-11-16T03:24:00.000Z	greencookie	rinaldi_	I'm running 7.1
2007-11-16T03:25:00.000Z	greencookie	rinaldi_	tahts what I was supposed to install as well. but I didnt have network connection hee
2007-11-16T03:25:00.000Z	rinaldi_	greencookie	ah i see
