2008-10-22T21:06:00.000Z	reqqit		ok so I have this app that is likely to take down the whole system
2008-10-22T21:06:00.000Z	reqqit		short of running a whole linux system in a VM, is there a safety wrapper I can put around this app to sandbox it?
2008-10-22T21:06:00.000Z	reqqit		app is amsn
2008-10-22T21:07:00.000Z	kunwon1	reqqit	it depends on what you're trying to prevent from happening
2008-10-22T21:07:00.000Z	reqqit	kunwon1	I am trying to stop it freezing the whole system and bringing about a catastrophe that could endanger the lives of everyone
2008-10-22T21:08:00.000Z	kunwon1	reqqit	there's very little defense against poorly written software.
2008-10-22T21:08:00.000Z	reqqit	kunwon1	we are all doomed
2008-10-22T21:08:00.000Z	reqqit		Have you seen what most of the world are running?
2008-10-22T21:08:00.000Z	kunwon1	reqqit	what's amsn? Are you looking for an IM app?
2008-10-22T21:09:00.000Z	reqqit	kunwon1	I am looking for an alternative yes, but I have some messages in amsn, and I want to check them
2008-10-22T21:09:00.000Z	reqqit		but, this version has a unique 'kill the system when you open lol' feature
2008-10-22T21:10:00.000Z	kunwon1	reqqit	I'm not familiar with amsn, but if I were you I'd try to fix the problem that crashes the system. If amsn is a gui app, you might be able to get more feedback (in the way of error messages) by running it from a terminal. Just a shot in the dark :)
2008-10-22T21:12:00.000Z	reqqit	kunwon1	I have another question, from TTY1 (right term?) can I open a GUI app to show in alt-f7 (what is the right term?)
2008-10-22T21:12:00.000Z	reqqit		because, the gui on the terminal might freeze, and I can't ctrl-c the app
2008-10-22T21:13:00.000Z	kunwon1	reqqit	you can open a terminal in your desktop environment, rather than switching out to a virtual terminal
2008-10-22T21:13:00.000Z	kunwon1	reqqit	then you'd have the app and the launching terminal both on the same screen
2008-10-22T21:13:00.000Z	reqqit	kunwon1	I won't be able to alt-tab / click on it, because the system freezes, but alt-f1 term works
2008-10-22T21:14:00.000Z	reqqit		I've kills amsn (wish8.5) and gnome-* and other apps, but system is still frozen when it happens
2008-10-22T21:14:00.000Z	kunwon1	reqqit	ctrl+alt+backspace will restart your gui when that happens. I'd just be worried about finding the error messages and trying to fix them. Does your app put any logs in /var/log?
2008-10-22T21:16:00.000Z	reqqit	kunwon1	I'll rerun it with ctrl-alt-backspace in mind, thanks
2008-10-22T21:16:00.000Z	kunwon1	reqqit	np, good luck
