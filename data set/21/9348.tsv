2007-10-03T09:20:00.000Z	heman		Does anyone know how I can change the look of the top and bottom menus
2007-10-03T09:20:00.000Z	heman		so that they are smooth and transparent like on vista but without that theme...
2007-10-03T09:20:00.000Z	soundray	heman	right-click and select properties
2007-10-03T09:29:00.000Z	soundray	heman	ask in #ubuntu+1 please
2007-10-03T09:29:00.000Z	soundray	heman	and, if you have to ask, the answer is probably no.
2007-10-03T09:31:00.000Z	soundray	heman	which one?
2007-10-03T09:32:00.000Z	soundray	heman	look at the private messages from ubotu
2007-10-03T09:33:00.000Z	heman	soundray	vlet: thanks :P
2007-10-03T09:45:00.000Z	soundray	heman	this channel not busy enough for you?
2007-10-03T09:46:00.000Z	heman	soundray	its busy yes I know but still...oh I get it lol :P sorry
2007-10-03T09:50:00.000Z	soundray	heman	it's the name of the user empowered to do everything on the system.
2007-10-03T09:51:00.000Z	heman	soundray	so because im the only ubuntu user in the root admin?
2007-10-03T09:51:00.000Z	soundray	heman	it's best to do day-to-day, non-administration work as a non-privileged user.
2007-10-03T09:52:00.000Z	heman	soundray	sorry for being very stupid but I don't understand why?
2007-10-03T09:52:00.000Z	soundray	heman	there are various reasons: protection from others (attackers from the outside), and protection from yourself.
2007-10-03T09:53:00.000Z	soundray	heman	as root, you can destroy your entire installation with a simple five-letter command.
2007-10-03T09:53:00.000Z	soundray	heman	and if your root account is disabled, it's harder to crack, because the attacker would have to guess your username *and* your passwor
2007-10-03T09:56:00.000Z	soundray	heman	no, especially since you're inexperienced, you're likely to get something wrong and hose your system.
2007-10-03T09:57:00.000Z	heman	soundray	ok I get ya
