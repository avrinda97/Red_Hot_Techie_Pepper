2012-01-04T19:27:00.000Z	SVNDR		Where does a terminal window go when i minimize it?? i cant reopen it but everytime i click the terminal icon it just open a new one
2012-01-04T19:28:00.000Z	usr13	SVNDR	Alt-Tab
2012-01-04T19:30:00.000Z	usr13	SVNDR	Are you sure you are minimizing it?
2012-01-04T19:31:00.000Z	SVNDR	usr13	pretty positive, i just texted it then, i minimized and it acted like it quit
2012-01-04T19:32:00.000Z	usr13	SVNDR	Maybe the minimize and close buttons have somehow been transposed?
2012-01-04T19:32:00.000Z	SVNDR	usr13	is that possible? lol how can it be fixed?
2012-01-04T19:33:00.000Z	SVNDR	usr13	it doesnt do that for any other window
