2007-05-13T05:42:00.000Z	soundray	ziroday	/join #ubuntu-cn
2007-06-18T15:42:00.000Z	ziroday	soundray	what do you want to know?
2007-06-18T15:43:00.000Z	soundray	ziroday	what your problem is
2007-06-18T15:43:00.000Z	ziroday	soundray	i cannot preview and natilius does not recognize .png files
2007-06-18T15:44:00.000Z	ziroday	soundray	i have to open it with image viewer or gthumb
2007-06-18T15:45:00.000Z	soundray	ziroday	have you checked nautilus settings? Edit-Preferences-Preview
2007-06-18T15:45:00.000Z	ziroday	soundray	yea and i have deleted .nautilus and .thumbnails
2007-06-18T15:47:00.000Z	soundray	ziroday	other graphic formats work?
2007-06-18T15:47:00.000Z	ziroday	soundray	yeah
2007-06-18T15:47:00.000Z	ziroday	soundray	and .png used to work to
2007-06-18T15:48:00.000Z	soundray	ziroday	does it log any error messages in ~/.xsession-errors?
2007-06-18T15:48:00.000Z	ziroday	soundray	nope
2007-06-18T15:49:00.000Z	soundray	ziroday	when you deleted ~/.nautilus, was it running at the time?
2007-06-18T15:50:00.000Z	ziroday	soundray	yeah but i have since restarted
2007-06-18T15:50:00.000Z	ziroday	soundray	could that have been it?
2007-06-18T15:50:00.000Z	soundray	ziroday	log out, start a failsafe session and delete .nautilus from there. Otherwise nautilus recreates the original when it exits (I believe)
2007-06-18T15:51:00.000Z	ziroday	soundray	kk thanks will try
2007-09-04T05:17:00.000Z	ziroday	soundray	go to #openoffice.org
