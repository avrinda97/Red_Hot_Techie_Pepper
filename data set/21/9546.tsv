2007-05-01T16:13:00.000Z	Stormx2	m0ns00n	it is enabled by default.
2007-05-01T16:14:00.000Z	m0ns00n	Stormx2	But it doesn't seem to work
2007-05-01T16:14:00.000Z	m0ns00n	Stormx2	I can't have more than one sound playing at the same time
2007-05-01T16:14:00.000Z	m0ns00n	Stormx2	So it doesn't work
2007-05-01T16:14:00.000Z	m0ns00n	Stormx2	If I have amarok playing or something else, that's the only thing that's gonna play
2007-05-01T16:15:00.000Z	m0ns00n	Stormx2	Flash player sound, games, whatever doesn't work then
2007-05-01T16:16:00.000Z	Stormx2	m0ns00n	Some apps aren't dmix enabled, so may be blocking the soundcard
2007-05-01T16:16:00.000Z	Stormx2	m0ns00n	run this: lsof /dev/dsp* /dev/snd/*
2007-05-01T16:17:00.000Z	m0ns00n	Stormx2	How can they do that if they don't run as root?
2007-05-01T16:17:00.000Z	Stormx2	m0ns00n	Do you see any lines with /dev/dsp in em?
2007-05-01T16:17:00.000Z	m0ns00n	Stormx2	amarokapp 13697 m0ns00n   24w   CHR   14,3      13657 /dev/dsp
2007-05-01T16:18:00.000Z	Stormx2	m0ns00n	Therefore, amarok is blocking the soundcard.
2007-05-01T16:18:00.000Z	m0ns00n	Stormx2	Hmm, k
2007-05-01T16:19:00.000Z	Stormx2	m0ns00n	Under system > preferences > sound, set everything to alsa
2007-05-01T16:19:00.000Z	m0ns00n	Stormx2	Yes I have
2007-05-01T16:19:00.000Z	m0ns00n	Stormx2	But amarok was using oss, but I thought this was a wrapper
2007-05-01T16:19:00.000Z	Stormx2		Who was the person who having problems with vlc and mplayer?
2007-05-01T16:19:00.000Z	m0ns00n	Stormx2	when running the sound in amarok through alsa it's thrashed (lots of clipping noise)
2007-05-01T16:19:00.000Z	Stormx2	m0ns00n	Hmm.. it can be. The whole soundsystem thing is complex
2007-05-01T16:20:00.000Z	m0ns00n	Stormx2	Now it sound sgood =)
2007-05-01T16:20:00.000Z	m0ns00n	Stormx2	Had to restart amarok
