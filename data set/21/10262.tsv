2005-11-04T09:41:00.000Z	sobersabre		Hi, where can I read about salary rates for unix/linux professionals - sysad/system programmers/kernel programmers/ , say in Australia, USA, New Zealand, etc., I prefer, pure income ( with reduced tax) numbers
2005-11-04T09:41:00.000Z	Kamping_Kaiser	sobersabre	intersting countries to pick
2005-11-04T09:41:00.000Z	Kamping_Kaiser	sobersabre	sorry, i don't know off the top of my head. i would have to ask around (and take a day or t2)
2005-11-04T09:41:00.000Z	sobersabre	Kamping_Kaiser	why "interesting" ?
2005-11-04T09:42:00.000Z	Kamping_Kaiser	sobersabre	partly because i live in aust, and because your IP is not in one of those countries (it looks lik eitaly?)
2005-11-04T09:43:00.000Z	sobersabre	Kamping_Kaiser	it isn't italy. you know, there are utilities like host, nslookup, if you're so nosy
2005-11-04T09:44:00.000Z	Kamping_Kaiser	sobersabre	I'm not particularly, but i do look at hostmasks as people join
2005-11-04T09:44:00.000Z	Kamping_Kaiser	sobersabre	fair enough :)
2005-11-04T09:45:00.000Z	sobersabre	Kamping_Kaiser	so, how do all the above professions live like ... ? ok ? nice ?
2005-11-04T09:46:00.000Z	Kamping_Kaiser	sobersabre	i don't know many admins, but they don't get particularly special rates (the ones i know), but they can be paid a lot. as i said, i only know a few in aust
2005-11-04T09:51:00.000Z	sobersabre	Kamping_Kaiser	I don't know. I think it should parallelize.
2005-11-04T09:52:00.000Z	Kamping_Kaiser	sobersabre	i would like it to, but I'm not a dev ;)
2005-11-04T09:52:00.000Z	sobersabre	Kamping_Kaiser	then become one
2005-11-04T09:52:00.000Z	Kamping_Kaiser	sobersabre	i cant program... yet....
2005-11-04T09:53:00.000Z	sobersabre	Kamping_Kaiser	anyone can program
2005-11-04T09:53:00.000Z	Kamping_Kaiser	sobersabre	i have a website to write, then x86 assembly to learn, then I'm moving onto C++
2005-11-04T09:53:00.000Z	sobersabre	Kamping_Kaiser	you're wrong :)
2005-11-04T09:54:00.000Z	Kamping_Kaiser	sobersabre	my bad ;)
2005-11-04T09:54:00.000Z	sobersabre	Kamping_Kaiser	learn structural language, like C or Pascal ( which is more structured )
2005-11-04T09:55:00.000Z	sobersabre	Kamping_Kaiser	the easiest, and the most comprehensible way of thinking is structural, then play with asm, whilst learning computer arch. and only then move to python, it is Object oriented enough and a great language for both scripts and programs.
2005-11-04T09:58:00.000Z	Kamping_Kaiser	sobersabre	satanic :D
