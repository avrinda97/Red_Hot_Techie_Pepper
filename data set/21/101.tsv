2012-09-24T17:23:00.000Z	jilt007	ActionParsnip	 I am familiar with nmap, but how to use smbtree , never heared about this
2012-09-24T17:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jilt007	just run it, then type your user password
2012-09-24T17:24:00.000Z	jilt007	ActionParsnip	i did that but nothing happend
2012-09-24T17:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jilt007	its to show samba shares but it will show the systems even if they are not sharing stuff
2012-09-24T17:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jilt007	thought it'd show the systems on the LAN. oh well
