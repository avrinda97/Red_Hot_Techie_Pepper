2009-07-15T11:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SuspectZero	you can use nfs or sshfs if you want
2009-07-15T11:29:00.000Z	SuspectZero	ActionParsnip	yea i already have ssh set up so i can control the box remotely
2009-07-15T11:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SuspectZero	then you can use the same service to file share

2010-12-15T02:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SuspectZero	if you run: sudo apt-get update    first, it should update apt's knowledge of packages
2010-12-15T02:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SuspectZero	or you may need a PPA to get the newer if it isn't on the official repo
2010-12-15T02:09:00.000Z	SuspectZero	ActionParsnip	srry i wasnt trying to be smart or funny, that was a legimate question cause i didnt think about having other computers
