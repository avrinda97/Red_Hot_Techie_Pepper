2012-02-21T02:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	WebDawg	what activities are you going to do in the remote session?
2012-02-21T02:31:00.000Z	WebDawg	ActionParsnip	I need to be able to see what is on the screen.  Point and click I already have ssh enabled.
2012-02-21T02:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	WebDawg	but why do you need to be able to see what is on screen, for what purpose?
2012-02-21T02:31:00.000Z	WebDawg	ActionParsnip	What?
2012-02-21T02:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	WebDawg	why do you need to see the screen?
2012-02-21T02:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	WebDawg	yes but to achieve what? What activities will be done once you are connected...
2012-02-21T02:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	WebDawg	does the client system have an X server on it (Desktop linux will have this)?
2012-02-21T02:36:00.000Z	WebDawg	ActionParsnip	Yes.
2012-02-21T02:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	WebDawg	then just launch the browser from your SSH session. be sure to connect with:  ssh -X username@server
2012-02-21T02:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	WebDawg	you can then run:   firefox &      and the browser will run.
2012-02-21T02:38:00.000Z	WebDawg	ActionParsnip	now what should I do if I want to see what the user is doing on the screen or an error that comes up or such?
2012-02-21T02:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	WebDawg	ahh if its for that then vnc is handy
2012-02-21T02:40:00.000Z	WebDawg	ActionParsnip	I did not know X server interaction was so simple he.
2012-02-21T02:41:00.000Z	WebDawg	ActionParsnip	does it require a running x server on the remote server to launch software like that?
2012-02-21T02:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	WebDawg	you will get  a window of the desktop, you said you wanted to see the desktop to help folks...
