2005-04-17T06:10:00.000Z	sommers		heyas. i just installed ubuntu hoary from the CD. and am reading ubuntu guide. after installing, i just updated my sources.list from ubuntuguide website and did apt-get update. but i get an error with the nerim.net entry, what do i do to correct it so the error goes away?
2005-04-17T06:11:00.000Z	sommers		but i'd rather not have it. I know that i need to import the keys probably, but i dunno howto :)
2005-04-17T06:13:00.000Z	sommers		:))
2005-04-17T06:13:00.000Z	sommers		now do i need to apt-get upgrade?
2005-04-17T06:13:00.000Z	sommers		and how do i stop some packages from upgrading, like if it wants to update 1,2,3, but i wanmt to stop 1 and install 2 and 3, then how do i make it do that?
2005-04-17T06:14:00.000Z	lunitik	sommers	dpkg --set-selections pkgname hold
2005-04-17T06:15:00.000Z	sommers	lunitik	ok.
2005-04-17T06:15:00.000Z	lunitik	sommers	replace 'hold' with 'install' to turn that off when its no longer broken...
2005-04-17T06:17:00.000Z	sommers	lunitik	yeah, the dpkg --set-selections pkgname hold is right i think.
2005-04-17T06:18:00.000Z	lunitik	sommers	it really means your user
2005-04-17T06:19:00.000Z	lunitik	sommers	if thats broken (its saying that its reporting the incident) you need to boot to rescue mode and add your user to /etc/sudoers
2005-04-17T06:29:00.000Z	lunitik	sommers	I don't think that qualifies as "sometime" ... not in that sense at least  :)
2005-04-17T06:29:00.000Z	lunitik	sommers	umm... most like Evolution  :/
2005-04-17T06:30:00.000Z	lunitik	sommers	second icon from System (or Computer... depending on version)
2005-04-17T06:32:00.000Z	lunitik	sommers	apt-get autoclean
2005-04-17T06:32:00.000Z	lunitik	sommers	yeah... umm... could try just changing the icon instead?
2005-04-17T06:33:00.000Z	lunitik	sommers	you have no idea what a kernel is huh?
2005-04-17T06:34:00.000Z	lunitik	sommers	sure it would... a peice of paper with a green foot on it here  :/
2005-04-17T06:37:00.000Z	lunitik	sommers	via 'Music Player' in Sound and Video after doing what thoreauputic just said  ;)
2005-04-17T06:45:00.000Z	lunitik	sommers	that ought to be /mnt/windows (or simular) ... but I'll let it slide  :P
2005-04-17T06:46:00.000Z	lunitik	sommers	one day... look up FHS  :)   (filesystem hiarchy standard)
