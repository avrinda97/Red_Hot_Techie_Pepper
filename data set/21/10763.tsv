2006-01-01T14:11:00.000Z	Amaranth	ITSa341	You installed xorg-driver-fglrx?
2006-01-01T14:12:00.000Z	Amaranth	ITSa341	And changed the xorg driver to fglrx instead of ati?
2006-01-01T14:12:00.000Z	Amaranth	ITSa341	Ok, then ATI doesn't like you.
2006-01-01T14:12:00.000Z	Amaranth	ITSa341	They don't support the newer cards right away for linux.
2006-01-01T14:16:00.000Z	Amaranth	ITSa341	Oh, x fails to start when you change the driver?
