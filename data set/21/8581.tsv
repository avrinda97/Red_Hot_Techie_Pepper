2009-02-23T20:28:00.000Z	LjL	sanity	i don't know of a resource, i can tell you roughly (but i might be wrong too) that "VIRT" is what the process has allocated in total, "RES" is what is actually in RAM, "SHR" is what was allocated as shared memory with other programs
2009-02-23T20:29:00.000Z	sanity	LjL	thanks.  so doesn't top tell you whether any of a processes' data is swapped out to disk?
2009-02-23T20:30:00.000Z	LjL	sanity	not by default i don't think, but there should be an option
2009-02-23T20:30:00.000Z	sanity	LjL	ok, will check - thanks
2009-02-23T20:31:00.000Z	LjL	sanity	actually, it seems it does, because the manpage actually says that VIRT = SWAP + RES, so the swapped-out portion should simply be VIRT-RES (i thought VIRT also included allocated-but-as-yet-unused pages)
2009-02-23T20:31:00.000Z	LjL	sanity	search for "swapped size" in the manpage
2009-02-23T20:31:00.000Z	sanity	LjL	ah, ok
2009-02-23T20:32:00.000Z	sanity	LjL	hmm, well - just now in my process VIRT is 7843m, and RES is 2.1g - could that mean most of my app is swapped out?  I'm not sure why it would do that when apparently there is 5g free memory
2009-02-23T20:33:00.000Z	LjL	sanity	no that doesn't make sense to me, i thought VIRT should always be bigger than RES. i need to look better
2009-02-23T20:33:00.000Z	sanity	LjL	well, VIRT is bigger than RES in this case
2009-02-23T20:34:00.000Z	LjL	sanity	err... yes of course it is. i read the numbers wrong :>
2009-02-23T20:34:00.000Z	LjL	sanity	so yes, it *should* mean that most of your app is swapped out, at least according to the manpage
2009-02-23T20:34:00.000Z	LjL	sanity	but i still suspect somehow that VIRT might also include things that aren't really swapped out, but are simply allocated-and-as-of-yet-unused
2009-02-23T20:34:00.000Z	sanity	LjL	that doesn't make a lot of sense - why would it swap out over half my app when it has so much free space?
2009-02-23T20:34:00.000Z	sanity	LjL	right
2009-02-23T20:35:00.000Z	sanity	LjL	is there a better command than top for investigating per-process memory/swap usage?
2009-02-23T20:35:00.000Z	LjL	sanity	mind, the manpage doesn't say that, but looking at my own process table, i do suspect that's the case
2009-02-23T20:35:00.000Z	LjL	sanity	"top" should give you all sort of information if you pass it the right parameters - look at the manpage, there's plenty... "ps" should also do
2009-02-23T20:39:00.000Z	LjL	sanity	kind of
2009-02-23T20:39:00.000Z	LjL	sanity	you can set swappiness to 0, then it will never swap out anything unless it absolutely needs to
2009-02-23T20:40:00.000Z	LjL	sanity	i don't know if you can do that per-process
