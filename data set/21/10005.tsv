2005-05-29T06:52:00.000Z	nickrud	coorey	what tasks do you do, that will help you evalutate the tools ubuntu provides
2005-05-29T06:53:00.000Z	coorey	nickrud	i normally use adobe cs2 for graphics (computer/graphics major) and basic chat programs.
2005-05-29T06:55:00.000Z	nickrud	coorey	gimp is the only thing linux has to offer for graphics, and, for pros, I hear it's not the best, but, run ubuntu anyway :)
2005-05-29T06:56:00.000Z	coorey	nickrud	we have a few graphics programs here at my university that were engineered for unix and linux based systems. . . so i would like to get my feet wet and learn how to make graphics on all the major os's. i already have learned for mac and windows. all thats left is linux.
2005-05-29T06:57:00.000Z	nickrud	coorey	then you have not a thing to loose, except some time
2005-05-29T06:57:00.000Z	coorey	nickrud	so i will just have the profs here install the programs on my linux os for me. yeah the time is in the wait for the dvd to finish downloading
2005-05-29T06:57:00.000Z	nickrud	coorey	then ubuntu will be about as stable a platform as you could ask for.
2005-05-29T06:59:00.000Z	coorey	nickrud	thanks for the helpful info
2005-05-29T06:59:00.000Z	nickrud	coorey	most things you will want will be in the ubuntu repositories, including inkscape.
2005-05-29T07:00:00.000Z	coorey	nickrud	this Ubuntu is looking very promising and I haven't even installed it yet. I can't wait for the download to finish so I can burn it and learn it.
2005-05-29T07:00:00.000Z	nickrud	coorey	I've been running debian, the basis of ubuntu, and only loaded it as a dare. the darer won
2005-05-29T07:03:00.000Z	nickrud	coorey	as long as your machine is quick, with googlplexes of memory, it will do graphics better
2005-05-29T07:04:00.000Z	coorey	nickrud	no prob their, when i entered the graphics major at my school, i switched over to an AMD64 FX with 3gb ddr. so thats not the prob, i just run a ton of graphics programs which always causes windows to go haywire. so i'm hoping linux will fix this problem
2005-05-29T07:06:00.000Z	nickrud	coorey	I hope it works for you.
2005-05-29T07:07:00.000Z	coorey	nickrud	yeah you all have got me excited about it. 32 minutes left on the download, and you will see me disconnect.
2005-05-29T07:12:00.000Z	nickrud	coorey	if you've never head of vmware, you probably wanna look at it
2005-05-29T07:13:00.000Z	nickrud	coorey	assuming there's a x86 in the mix somewhere :)
2005-05-29T07:16:00.000Z	coorey	nickrud	thanks. looking at their product site now, might be able to help me out at this point.
2005-05-29T07:17:00.000Z	nickrud	coorey	if you have the resourses ....
2005-05-29T07:19:00.000Z	coorey	nickrud	seeing that my pc already crashes from too much resources being pulled, don't know if it will support one more virtual window being opened. i can only add one more stick of ram into the pc because it only supports 4gb. maybe its time to move up to windows 2003 server so my pc will support more than 1gb sticks in each slot.
2005-05-29T07:20:00.000Z	nickrud	coorey	no, that won't be an issue, the switching with vmware happens a level windows won't even see, in fact, you can probably run an instance of windows
