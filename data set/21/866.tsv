2011-09-01T15:34:00.000Z	AFD		I'm having trouble removing ubuntu-desktop from a server and replacing with Xubuntu
2011-09-01T15:34:00.000Z	AFD		tried "sudo apt-get remove ubuntu-desktop"
2011-09-01T15:34:00.000Z	AFD		and then "sudo apt-get autoremove" and it's still there
2011-09-01T15:35:00.000Z	glebihan	AFD	have a look at ubottu's message
2011-09-01T15:40:00.000Z	AFD	glebihan	I've just tried the bot response and followed the guide on the link given but the terminal keeps spitting back that some of the packages I'm trying to remove aren't there
2011-09-01T15:41:00.000Z	AFD	glebihan	 can I add "-something" to just let it skip errors?
2011-09-01T15:41:00.000Z	glebihan	AFD	could you pastebin the exact error message ??
2011-09-01T15:43:00.000Z	AFD	glebihan	http://pastebin.com/2p3zab6H
2011-09-01T15:43:00.000Z	AFD	glebihan	it's just telling me that the packages aren't there I think...
2011-09-01T15:43:00.000Z	glebihan	AFD	and you're trying to remove those packages ?
2011-09-01T15:44:00.000Z	AFD	glebihan	 I'm following this (where the bot told me to try) http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/purexfce
2011-09-01T15:45:00.000Z	glebihan	AFD	well if you get this message then this package is not installed, just skip it
2011-09-01T15:46:00.000Z	AFD	glebihan	is there not a way to --skip-broken or something when removing?
2011-09-01T15:46:00.000Z	glebihan	AFD	I don't think so
2011-09-01T15:47:00.000Z	AFD	glebihan	sorry - I may have made a n00b error and am following the walkthrough for 11.04 when I am on 10.04 - found another link and trying it now
2011-09-01T15:47:00.000Z	glebihan	AFD	ok
2011-09-01T15:48:00.000Z	AFD	glebihan	Pici thanks for the advice... the other line of code seems to be working
2011-09-01T16:11:00.000Z	AFD	glebihan	are you still there? I could do with a little more advice pls
2011-09-01T16:12:00.000Z	AFD	glebihan	I managed to uninstall ubuntu-desktop and have apparently install xubuntu-desktop too
2011-09-01T16:12:00.000Z	AFD	glebihan	but I am using freeNX to connect to the server which xubuntu should now be on and I don't get a DE like I did with Gnome - I get a single bg colour and nothing else
2011-09-01T16:12:00.000Z	AFD	glebihan	any ideas?
