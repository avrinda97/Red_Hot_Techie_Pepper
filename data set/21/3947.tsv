2008-08-15T21:48:00.000Z	guntbert	isharis	just for quick test: press <ctrl><alt><backspace>, that kills your session, it should start again
2008-08-15T21:54:00.000Z	guntbert	isharis	is it ok for you at the moment?
2008-08-15T21:55:00.000Z	isharis	guntbert	Ok, at the moment but I don't know if It will be Ok after I restart.
2008-08-15T21:56:00.000Z	isharis	guntbert	Do you have any idea how to completely eliminate this issue?
2008-08-15T21:57:00.000Z	guntbert	isharis	I suggest you wait and see, in any case logging off and on seems to help, and as a last resort you can press <ctrl><alt><backspace>, that kills your session, it should start again
2008-08-16T22:46:00.000Z	guntbert	isharis	it didnt delete them, just hide
2008-08-16T22:47:00.000Z	isharis	guntbert	how do I reset?
2008-08-16T22:47:00.000Z	guntbert	isharis	sudo umount /media
2008-08-16T22:48:00.000Z	isharis	guntbert	sudo umount: command not found
2008-08-16T22:48:00.000Z	guntbert	isharis	mount
2008-08-16T22:49:00.000Z	isharis	guntbert	still didn't worked
2008-08-16T22:49:00.000Z	guntbert	isharis	was there an error? or a list of mountpoints?
2008-08-16T22:50:00.000Z	isharis	guntbert	unmount is an unknown command
2008-08-16T22:51:00.000Z	guntbert	isharis	it was 'umount' not 'unmount'
2008-08-16T22:51:00.000Z	isharis	guntbert	ohh lol.. ty anyway
