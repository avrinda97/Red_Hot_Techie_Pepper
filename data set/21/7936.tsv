2006-12-23T11:50:00.000Z	lori		can anyone help me configure built in wireless on a Presario v4000? I have just installed Ubuntu 6.10
2006-12-23T11:50:00.000Z	h3xis	lori	possibly. is it recognized by ubuntu out of the box?
2006-12-23T11:54:00.000Z	h3xis	lori	your chipset is ipw2200
2006-12-23T11:55:00.000Z	h3xis	lori	it should already work
2006-12-23T11:56:00.000Z	h3xis	lori	so it works, just no light?
2006-12-23T11:57:00.000Z	lori	h3xis	yes
2006-12-23T11:57:00.000Z	h3xis	lori	not sure about that :/ let me check google
2006-12-23T11:57:00.000Z	lori	h3xis	thanks for any input you might have.
2006-12-23T11:59:00.000Z	h3xis	lori	your other LEDs work right?
2006-12-23T11:59:00.000Z	lori	h3xis	yes, all other led's work just fine out of the box
2006-12-23T12:02:00.000Z	lori	h3xis	i ran that command in a terminal, got a "permission denied". so i logged in as root and then ran command.  nothing seemed to happen.  Is that to be expected?
2006-12-23T12:02:00.000Z	h3xis	lori	yes
2006-12-23T12:02:00.000Z	h3xis	lori	now restart networking
2006-12-23T12:03:00.000Z	lori	h3xis	is there a command that'll allow me to restart without having to lost this connection?
2006-12-23T12:05:00.000Z	h3xis	lori	yes
2006-12-23T12:06:00.000Z	h3xis	lori	try this: rmmod ipw2200 then when it's done with that do modprobe ipw2200 all as root. you will lose your connection too
2006-12-23T12:12:00.000Z	h3xis	lori	no. that's why dont use ubuntu ;)
2006-12-23T12:15:00.000Z	lori	h3xis	i have just remembered another issue this laptop seems to have.
2006-12-23T12:16:00.000Z	h3xis	lori	?
2006-12-23T12:16:00.000Z	h3xis	lori	check that under Preferences > Power Management in gnome, i think
2006-12-23T12:19:00.000Z	lori	h3xis	&Ashton_nK, thanks for your knowledge!  I'm gonna play on the internet now *hug*
