2008-04-26T08:52:00.000Z	Assid		how do i change usplash back to ubuntu's usplash from kubuntu ?
2008-04-26T08:52:00.000Z	seamus7	Assid	good luck ... that can sometimes be tricky ...  do some searches via google and the ubuntu forums .. you need to make sure you have the graphic in the right location and there's a link which needs to point to it ..
2008-04-26T09:33:00.000Z	seamus7	Assid	it can be tricky ... gotenks lol
2008-04-26T09:34:00.000Z	seamus7	Assid	.. sorry .. two different messages there
2008-04-26T09:35:00.000Z	Assid	seamus7	keeps happening to me.. last time someone told me to restart grub.. instead of gnome.. they were talking to someone else for grub
2008-04-26T09:41:00.000Z	Assid	seamus7	this is irritating me
2008-04-26T09:42:00.000Z	seamus7	Assid	what guide are you following in order to change your usplash
2008-04-26T09:42:00.000Z	Assid	seamus7	no guide
2008-04-26T09:43:00.000Z	seamus7	Assid	what method are you using?
2008-04-26T09:43:00.000Z	Assid	seamus7	with referance to gprs? usplash?
2008-04-26T09:43:00.000Z	seamus7	Assid	usplash
2008-04-26T09:43:00.000Z	Assid	seamus7	apt-get install --reinstall usplash-theme-ubuntu
2008-04-26T09:44:00.000Z	seamus7	Assid	I believe you need to regenerate intramfs ... something like that ..
2008-04-26T09:44:00.000Z	Assid	seamus7	does it.. on its own
2008-04-26T09:48:00.000Z	seamus7	Assid	I think I remember having problems with usplash but eventually it worked once I made sure a link was pointing to the usplash.so .. or whatever the default is
2008-04-26T09:49:00.000Z	Assid	seamus7	my usplash works.. just getting kubuntu
2008-04-26T09:49:00.000Z	Assid	seamus7	anyways.. fixed it.. got ubuntu back again :P
2008-04-26T09:49:00.000Z	Assid	seamus7	now if only my usb gprs modem works! :(
2008-04-26T09:51:00.000Z	seamus7	Assid	... good what did you do differently to get it working?
