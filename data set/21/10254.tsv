2007-11-24T13:39:00.000Z	fairyeneried		can i run KDE4 in a computer with no compiz|beryl support?
2007-11-24T13:40:00.000Z	fairyeneried		i have a problem, and planning to delet KDE entirely of this machine for it
2007-11-24T13:40:00.000Z	fairyeneried		KDE has no window borders
2007-11-24T13:40:00.000Z	fairyeneried		i can use windows in thsi way
2007-11-24T13:40:00.000Z	fairyeneried		excuse me, i can't use windows in this way
2007-11-24T13:41:00.000Z	fairyeneried		let me check which KDE packages i have now
2007-11-24T13:42:00.000Z	fairyeneried		i installed the package kdebase
2007-11-24T13:42:00.000Z	fairyeneried		from synaptic
2007-11-24T13:42:00.000Z	astro76	fairyeneried	you might be better served with kubuntu-desktop package
2007-11-24T13:42:00.000Z	astro76		fyi
2007-11-24T13:43:00.000Z	fairyeneried		no just kdebase
2007-11-24T13:43:00.000Z	fairyeneried		no, kubuntu-desktop install a lot of things i don't use, i prefer gnome, but i need some KDE programs working well
2007-11-24T13:44:00.000Z	fairyeneried	stdin	i was thinking in deleting kde3 and turning into kde4 instead
2007-11-24T13:45:00.000Z	fairyeneried		maybe kde-core is a better alternative to kde-desktop?
2007-11-24T13:45:00.000Z	astro76	fairyeneried	do you want to run the kde programs from within gnome?
2007-11-24T13:45:00.000Z	astro76	fairyeneried	and if so, why not just install and let apt install the dependencies?
2007-11-24T13:46:00.000Z	fairyeneried		i want to use programs like amarok and konversation
2007-11-24T13:46:00.000Z	astro76		!wow | qball680
2007-11-24T13:46:00.000Z	fairyeneried		but people here needs scim for chinese and japanese
2007-11-24T13:47:00.000Z	fairyeneried		and kde programs are ignoring dead keys
2007-11-24T13:47:00.000Z	astro76	fairyeneried	you can just install amarok and konversation through apt-get, you don't have to worry about kde dependencies
