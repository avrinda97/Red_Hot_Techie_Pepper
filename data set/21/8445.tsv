2006-04-14T10:22:00.000Z	harisund		Could someone suggest a good FTP server to set up? I understand there are vsftpd, proftpd and a couple others, but I want to find out if there is any that I can easily set the parameters in a conf file?
2006-04-14T10:23:00.000Z	Xenguy	harisund	I found vsftpd straightforward
2006-04-14T10:23:00.000Z	harisund	Xenguy	oh ok. .. jdl: Thanks, I will try that out too..
2006-04-14T10:23:00.000Z	harisund	Xenguy	What is "wu" the worst? Any particular reasn?
2006-04-14T10:23:00.000Z	harisund	Xenguy	I am not particularly keen on security. It's only between 2 computers that I really want.
2006-04-14T10:24:00.000Z	Xenguy	harisund	fill yer boots =)
2006-04-14T10:24:00.000Z	harisund	Xenguy	Also do you know how to tranfer files through ftp through a cron file ..
2006-04-14T10:25:00.000Z	Xenguy	harisund	I assume you could do that with a bash/shell script; are you able to give an example of what you want to do?
2006-04-14T10:26:00.000Z	harisund	Xenguy	 I want to log in through ftp (anonymous/no password) into 192.168.0.5 from my current machine 192.168.0.1 (same subnet..) and transfer a folder using mput, sort of a backup mechanism.
2006-04-14T10:26:00.000Z	Xenguy	harisund	/me ponders...
2006-04-14T10:27:00.000Z	harisund	Xenguy	Hmm.. thanks .. do tell me if you get an idea.. I don't want to login using anonymous and no password everytme, and instead directly transfer files. For example in ssh you could do <ssh 192.168.0.5 "command"> and "command" would get executed on the remote machine.
2006-04-14T10:28:00.000Z	Xenguy	harisund	it sounds like the kind of thing that either 'rsync' or 'unison' would be better suited to do
2006-04-14T10:29:00.000Z	Xenguy	harisund	if it is uni-directional mirroring you want, then have a look at 'rsync'...
2006-04-14T10:29:00.000Z	harisund	Xenguy	Yes, rsync can do that and I can even use scp. But I was just curious to know if it could be done through ftp that's all.. (In fact with scp, I could transfer files using keys instead of passwords too)
2006-04-14T10:29:00.000Z	Xenguy	harisund	if bi-directional mirroring is needed, I'm having success with 'unison'
2006-04-14T10:30:00.000Z	harisund	Xenguy	Ok I will try the Unison application too.. as I said my question was simply to find out whether it could be done through ftp. not whether it could be done..
2006-04-14T10:30:00.000Z	harisund	Xenguy	Thanks for the union thing anyway, I will try it out..
2006-04-14T10:30:00.000Z	Xenguy	harisund	sounds like you have it covered then; yes I think you could write a shell script to automate it with FTP, but it would require more time and thought than I have ATM  :-)
2006-04-14T10:30:00.000Z	Xenguy	harisund	unison
2006-04-14T10:31:00.000Z	harisund	Xenguy	ok sure .. thanks a ton.. I will check it out ..
