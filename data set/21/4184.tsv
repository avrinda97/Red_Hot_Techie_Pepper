2008-07-31T23:59:00.000Z	guido		Hi guys, I'm forced to install an rpm-based framework on ubuntu, I had to install many package but I still get errors, please look at this installation-failure log... http://pastie.org/245070
2008-08-01T00:00:00.000Z	alraune	guido	used alien ?
2008-08-01T00:01:00.000Z	guido	alraune	no...
2008-08-01T00:01:00.000Z	alraune	guido	as rpm isn't supported in ubu, use alien to convert it to a deb-pckage
2008-08-01T00:02:00.000Z	alraune	guido	can't you get the tarball ?
2008-08-01T00:03:00.000Z	guido	alraune	gonna see, it isn't a simple package, is the "ltib", a development environment...
2008-08-01T00:03:00.000Z	guido		It has been tested on debian 3 and marked as unstable...
2008-08-01T00:03:00.000Z	guido		BU
2008-08-01T00:04:00.000Z	guido		But it can get installed at least, I think...
2008-08-01T00:04:00.000Z	alraune	guido	tarball is the better way, as alien sometimes files
2008-08-01T00:05:00.000Z	guido	alraune	you mean recompile it from source ?
2008-08-01T00:05:00.000Z	alraune	guido	tarball=recompile is the better way, as alien sometimes fails
2008-08-01T00:06:00.000Z	guido	alraune	ok, thanks !
2008-08-01T00:06:00.000Z	alraune		guido:but in debian no deb-package ???
2008-08-01T00:10:00.000Z	alraune		ï»¿kushal1: lspci
2008-08-01T00:11:00.000Z	guido	alraune	I have to correct myself... The framework is actually installed, the log comes out when i RUN the program ltib (with the --configure option or not)...
2008-08-01T00:11:00.000Z	guido		I need some help to understand the error... http://pastie.org/245070
2008-08-01T00:14:00.000Z	alraune		guido:see, paste the /home/guido/ltib/ltib-imx21ads-20070221/host_config.log
2008-08-01T00:14:00.000Z	alraune		guido:(cli) sudo update db
2008-08-01T00:16:00.000Z	guido	alraune	the file you have seen is just the host_config.log
2008-08-01T00:19:00.000Z	guido	alraune	i've downloaded the tarball and run an istalling script inside it, and now it seems to work... Thanks !
