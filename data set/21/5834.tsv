2007-09-20T10:25:00.000Z	dystopianray	dimas_	you can delete ~/.wine to remove all the programs you have installed using wine
2007-09-20T10:26:00.000Z	dimas_	dystopianray	but uninstalling program doesnt do so it frixes
2007-09-20T10:26:00.000Z	dystopianray	dimas_	i'm not sure what you're saying but deleting ~/.wine will remove all the programs you have installed in wine
2007-09-20T10:30:00.000Z	dystopianray	dimas_	open a terminal as your user and type: cd ~/.wine
2007-09-20T10:35:00.000Z	dystopianray	dimas_	just open a terminal and type: rm -rf ~/.wine
