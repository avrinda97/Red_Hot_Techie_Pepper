2007-12-05T03:26:00.000Z	Lhademmor		theLickKing, I previously tried that with no luck, but signal 9 apparently did the trick...
2007-12-05T03:28:00.000Z	Lhademmor		theLichKing.. sounds difficult...
2007-12-05T03:29:00.000Z	pg	Lhademmor	once it's a running proces, that is.
2007-12-05T03:23:00.000Z	pg	Lhademmor	once you start "top", press k and enter the process id corresponding to the trackerd process
2007-12-05T03:23:00.000Z	Lhademmor	pg	kill it with what signal?
2007-12-05T03:25:00.000Z	pg	Lhademmor	try signal 9
2007-12-05T03:26:00.000Z	Lhademmor	pg	signal 9 killed it :)
2007-12-05T03:27:00.000Z	Lhademmor	pg	theLichKing - in case this happens again... how to make the tracker tool use less resources? This time it simply went nuts!
2007-12-05T03:29:00.000Z	pg	Lhademmor	you can change its "nice" level using the "renice" command.  Type "man renice" to learn more.
2007-12-05T03:30:00.000Z	pg	Lhademmor	have you tried "man trackerd"?
2007-12-05T03:31:00.000Z	Lhademmor	pg	now I tried running "trackerd -n", which disables indexing, and nothing evil happened :)
2007-12-05T03:32:00.000Z	pg	Lhademmor	if you do that, tracker search engine on your computer will not be able to find any new files.
2007-12-05T03:33:00.000Z	Lhademmor	pg	maybe the low-memory command is the way to go...?
2007-12-05T03:34:00.000Z	pg	Lhademmor	I don't know that command.
2007-12-05T03:35:00.000Z	Lhademmor	pg	ok I'll try it out later (am in failsafe GNOME right now) - at least now I know how to kill it if it makes trouble again
2007-12-05T03:36:00.000Z	Lhademmor	pg	also interesting: When I started the trackerd now it said: "Initialising tracker...
2007-12-05T03:38:00.000Z	pg	Lhademmor	that's normal
2007-12-05T03:38:00.000Z	pg	Lhademmor	sorry, I did not see your second line.  I don't know if that is a problem.  Try searching for those messages on the web.
2007-12-05T03:45:00.000Z	Lhademmor	pg	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/tracker/+bug/149772 , the MOTU's are already notified it seems...
2007-12-05T03:46:00.000Z	pg	Lhademmor	good inspection job!  You can try to uninstall tracker and install beagle-search instead.
2007-12-05T03:47:00.000Z	Lhademmor	pg	ok will do
