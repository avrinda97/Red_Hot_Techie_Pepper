2009-06-18T17:17:00.000Z	sylvanus_		Hey does anyone know why Gyachi won't connect to yahoo?
2009-06-18T17:19:00.000Z	sylvanus_		it keeps on going back and forth from connected to disconnected and then tells me the connections timed out?
2009-06-18T17:20:00.000Z	sylvanus_		can anyone please help? (dumb in Maryland)
2009-06-18T17:22:00.000Z	sylvanus_		I just downloaded Gyachi so I can use my Webcam in chat and it won't connect to yahoo
2009-06-18T17:23:00.000Z	sylvanus_		yes I have
2009-06-18T17:24:00.000Z	sylvanus_		I can connect with pidgin but not Gyachi?
2009-06-18T17:25:00.000Z	sylvanus_		wow so it's not just me huh?
2009-06-18T17:25:00.000Z	sylvanus_		I guess
2009-06-18T17:26:00.000Z	sylvanus_		I'm kinda new to all this. I can connect with pidgin but i can't use cam with it
2009-06-18T17:27:00.000Z	sylvanus_		ok brb
2009-06-18T17:28:00.000Z	grawity	sylvanus_	Pidgin doesn't support webcams, and Pidgin seems to have problems with Yahoo IM - /join #pidgin
2009-08-24T15:05:00.000Z	grawity	sylvanus_	yes, and it seems you need to open /etc/apt/sources.list and fix like 58
2009-08-24T15:06:00.000Z	grawity	sylvanus_	type this command: sudo nano +58 /etc/apt/sources.list
2009-08-24T15:08:00.000Z	grawity	sylvanus_	remove the " characters from that line.
2009-08-24T15:11:00.000Z	sylvanus_	grawity	it I can't I tried delete and back space
2009-08-24T15:12:00.000Z	grawity	sylvanus_	hmm. Close the editor, then. (Ctrl-X, and then N)
2009-08-24T15:12:00.000Z	grawity	sylvanus_	And then run gksu gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
2009-08-24T15:16:00.000Z	grawity	sylvanus_	it should have opened a text editor.
2009-08-24T15:19:00.000Z	sylvanus_	grawity	you still here?
2009-08-24T15:19:00.000Z	grawity	sylvanus_	yes?
2009-08-24T15:23:00.000Z	grawity	sylvanus_	then you probably typed the command wrong :\
