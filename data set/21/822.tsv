2011-05-25T15:18:00.000Z	andrei23		anyone?
2011-05-25T15:18:00.000Z	bullgard4	andrei23	Yes. Put a specific question here in this channel.
2011-05-25T15:22:00.000Z	andrei23		I want to configure one of my machines to act as a router and firewall. I have read almost all the documentation in the community section but I can't find a well documented article on this subject.
2011-05-25T15:24:00.000Z	andrei23		I am looking for books/articles/anything that will explain routing/firewall very accurately.
2011-05-25T15:24:00.000Z	bullgard4	andrei23	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Router
2011-05-25T15:26:00.000Z	andrei23	bullgard4	I read that and I find it to be incomplete for my needs.

2011-05-25T15:27:00.000Z	bullgard4	andrei23	"I find it to be incomplete for my needs." <-- this may well be. Then please specify and elaborate.
2011-05-25T15:28:00.000Z	bullgard4		'~$ aptitude why [packetname]' prints a list of packetnames, each packaetname is prepended by "i   ", "i A" or "p   ". Does this stand for »installed«, »installed automatically« or »purged«, respectively?
2011-05-25T15:30:00.000Z	andrei23	bullgard4	for instance, the ip forwarding and masquerading shows just a config file with no explanations. I do agree it works fine but I can't seem to understand it in order to make it suit my need or debug it.
2011-05-25T15:32:00.000Z	andrei23	bullgard4	same goes with the next chapter, firewall. just a huge config file. I really need to understand the works behind it in order to make my custom server secure
2011-05-25T15:32:00.000Z	bullgard4	andrei23	So the proper way to solve your problem with the help of #ubuntu is that you name the "ip forwarding and masquerading" more precisely and ask for an explanation of your particular "ip forwarding and masquerading" problem.
2011-05-25T15:34:00.000Z	bullgard4	andrei23	Another route where you can go is that you ask in this channel for a "ip forwarding and masquerading" tutorial.
2011-05-25T15:36:00.000Z	andrei23	bullgard4	thank you for the advice. you are probably right, but having so many questions I believe I more fair from my side to read as much as I can on the subject and then ask questions.
2011-05-25T15:37:00.000Z	bullgard4	andrei23	Reading a tutorial is usually the best starting point when having many questions on a subject.
2011-05-25T15:37:00.000Z	andrei23	bullgard4	so, could you recommend me a solid ip forwarding and masquerading tutorial?
2011-05-25T15:37:00.000Z	bullgard4	andrei23	No, I can't.
2011-05-25T15:38:00.000Z	andrei23	bullgard4	You do know that that was my second line here, asking for books/tutorial recommendation?
2011-05-25T15:38:00.000Z	bullgard4	andrei23	I can recommend you the Wikipedia article on network address translation.
2011-05-25T15:39:00.000Z	andrei23	bullgard4	please do
