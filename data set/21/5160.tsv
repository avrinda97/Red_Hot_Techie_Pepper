2010-12-17T17:03:00.000Z	cnu_		I am newbiee. How to access my hd in ubuntu.
2010-12-17T17:04:00.000Z	cnu_		how to access the hard disk in ubuntu. I mean like we do in windows.
2010-12-17T17:04:00.000Z	soreau	cnu_	What do you mean by access?
2010-12-17T17:06:00.000Z	soreau	cnu_	Make sure the driver is mounted (see the output of mount). It will likely be called sdb*
2010-12-17T17:09:00.000Z	soreau	cnu_	Get to a terminal and type mount, then press enter
2010-12-17T17:16:00.000Z	soreau	cnu_	You can but you should keep chat in the channel
2010-12-17T17:24:00.000Z	soreau	cnu_	What do you mean connected hd2 and 3 but didn't know how to access the data in them?
2010-12-17T17:25:00.000Z	soreau	cnu_	You mean you physically reconnected them?
2010-12-17T17:25:00.000Z	soreau	cnu_	So you just need to mount them now
2010-12-17T17:26:00.000Z	soreau	cnu_	sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /some/empty/directory
2010-12-17T17:27:00.000Z	cnu_	soreau	you want me to type that in terminal......isn't it.
2010-12-17T17:27:00.000Z	soreau	cnu_	/dev/sdb is the second hard drive, /dev/sdb1 is the first partition on the second hard drive. /dev/sdc2 would be the second partition on the third hard drive
2010-12-17T17:28:00.000Z	soreau	cnu_	Pastebin the output of sudo fdisk -l
2010-12-17T17:29:00.000Z	soreau	cnu_	To pastebin.com
2010-12-17T17:30:00.000Z	soreau	cnu_	Ok, lets start with pastebinning.
2010-12-17T17:35:00.000Z	soreau	cnu_	That only shows your first hard drive, so you will likely need to make sure your drives are recognized in your system bios
2010-12-17T17:37:00.000Z	soreau	cnu_	You said you already connected both of them so I assume you have the power and data cables connected already. Just check your BIOS settings and see that the drives are indeed recognized by your computer in the first place
2010-12-17T17:39:00.000Z	soreau	cnu_	You have to reboot the machine to get into the bios settings
