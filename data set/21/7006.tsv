2006-12-24T07:30:00.000Z	w3ccv	un_operateur	need a -j ACCEPT to the iptables line
2006-12-24T07:42:00.000Z	un_operateur	w3ccv	you shouldnt need to do that -- iptables is a kernel module and reads from some config file -- iptables-save should suffice
2006-12-24T07:48:00.000Z	un_operateur	w3ccv	iptables is not a init.d script eh -- its a kernel module -- named iptable_filter
2006-12-24T07:49:00.000Z	w3ccv	un_operateur	there is an exectuable that loads, lists, and saves the kernel modules
2006-12-24T07:51:00.000Z	un_operateur	w3ccv	the netfilter_iptable kernel module loads the rules, /sbin/iptables -L lists them and /sbin/iptables-save saves them
2006-12-24T07:52:00.000Z	w3ccv	un_operateur	yes, as I said.  they are in /sbin
2006-12-24T07:53:00.000Z	un_operateur	w3ccv	but not in /etc/init.d tho -- which explains why peirce141 couldnt find any iptables files there
2006-12-24T07:54:00.000Z	w3ccv	un_operateur	how do I get rid of the dammed colors in a 'ls' black and whit is lats easier to read
2006-12-24T07:55:00.000Z	un_operateur	w3ccv	you probably have an alias for ls that turns on colours
2006-12-24T07:56:00.000Z	un_operateur	w3ccv	try -- alias ls='/bin/ls'
2006-12-24T08:00:00.000Z	w3ccv	un_operateur	thanks  now I can read my ls on the laptop
2006-12-24T08:01:00.000Z	un_operateur	w3ccv	it looks like you are indeed right about saving the content of iptables-save to a script in /etc/init.d --- i wonder how peirce141's tables get launched at startup
2006-12-24T08:02:00.000Z	un_operateur	w3ccv	you might want to change the alias in ~/.bash_aliases so it sticks
2006-12-24T08:04:00.000Z	w3ccv	un_operateur	  grep intab /etc/init.d/*
2006-12-24T08:04:00.000Z	w3ccv	un_operateur	  grep intab /etc/init.d/* returned nothing here too
2006-12-24T08:05:00.000Z	un_operateur	w3ccv	grep intab ?  :)
2006-12-24T08:07:00.000Z	w3ccv	un_operateur	I much prefer xchat to gaim, but doesn't want to install on Edgy  got any ideas  apt-get says it is a broken package
2006-12-24T08:09:00.000Z	un_operateur	w3ccv	I think you might want to install xchat2 or x-chat2 (cant remember which)
2006-12-24T08:32:00.000Z	un_operateur	w3ccv	the server seems down
2006-12-24T08:34:00.000Z	w3ccv	un_operateur	 ok, I thought there was a boobo in my files.  I'll just keep.  Actually there is no DNS entry for it.  (did a nslookup)
2006-12-24T08:35:00.000Z	un_operateur	w3ccv	you can always use another mirror in the meantime -- sudo perl -i.bak -pe 's/ubuntu/uk\.ubuntu/' /etc/apt/sources.list
