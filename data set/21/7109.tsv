2006-11-27T17:46:00.000Z	gurkZor	bimberi	Do you know how I install these drivers? http://saillard.org/linux/pwc/
2006-11-27T17:48:00.000Z	bimberi	gurkZor	sorry no,  have you tried 'sudo modprobe pwc' (to load the shipped kernel module)?
2006-11-27T17:51:00.000Z	gurkZor	bimberi	Yes, i've tried "sudo modprobe pwc" but I get the message: "FATAL: Module pwc not found."
2006-11-27T17:53:00.000Z	bimberi	gurkZor	hmmk, I have one here (6.10 Edgy i386).  Are you on a different Ubuntu version/architecture?
2006-11-27T17:55:00.000Z	bimberi	gurkZor	which kernel  (uname -r)
2006-11-27T17:56:00.000Z	bimberi	gurkZor	ah, I'm on -generic
2006-11-27T17:56:00.000Z	bimberi	gurkZor	yep 'sudo apt-get install linux-generic' and reboot
2006-11-27T17:58:00.000Z	bimberi	gurkZor	poolkey172: np :)
2006-11-27T06:03:00.000Z	gurkZor	bimberi	Same error, and Ive installed generic
2006-11-27T06:03:00.000Z	bimberi	gurkZor	did you reboot?
2006-11-27T06:03:00.000Z	gurkZor	bimberi	haha, nope.. guess that's important xD
2006-11-27T06:04:00.000Z	bimberi	gurkZor	:)
2006-11-27T06:26:00.000Z	gurkZor	bimberi	I did the "sudo modprobe pwc" command, but it didn't do the trick
2006-11-27T06:27:00.000Z	bimberi	gurkZor	sorry, no :|
2006-11-27T06:29:00.000Z	bimberi	gurkZor	up to you, choose the one you feel is performing the best :).  by the way you can change the default by editing /boot/grub/menu.lst (line beginning with 'default')
2006-11-27T06:29:00.000Z	gurkZor	bimberi	I'm aware of that, but I can't tell the difference between -generic an "normal"
2006-11-27T06:30:00.000Z	bimberi	gurkZor	uname -r
2006-11-27T06:30:00.000Z	gurkZor	bimberi	I'm running -generic but I don't "feel" the difference
2006-11-27T06:31:00.000Z	bimberi	gurkZor	there probably isn't much between it and -386
