2007-02-01T15:45:00.000Z	rosalsazs		hi all
2007-02-01T15:46:00.000Z	rosalsazs		i have some one who wants to install ubuntu as a server mainly as a CMS
2007-02-01T15:46:00.000Z	rosalsazs		they installed ubuntu server but the want a gui
2007-02-01T15:47:00.000Z	rosalsazs		would they be better off with ubuntu normal?
2007-02-01T15:47:00.000Z	rosalsazs		or should they install a gui on ubuntu server?
2007-02-01T15:47:00.000Z	LjL	rosalsazs	i don't think, a GUI can be installed on the server version too. however, if they're going to use the system for *desktop* kind of things, then the server edition is most probably not the right choice
2007-02-01T15:49:00.000Z	rosalsazs	LjL	he want to use it to run a cms like mabo etc
2007-02-01T15:49:00.000Z	LjL	rosalsazs	well, and the problem is?
2007-02-01T15:50:00.000Z	LjL	rosalsazs	no, it's just that the server edition is optimized for that sort of things. but they'll work quite fine on the desktop edition too
2007-02-01T15:51:00.000Z	rosalsazs	LjL	: is  there any disadvantage of runing apache and stuff on ubuntu normal?
2007-02-01T15:52:00.000Z	rosalsazs	LjL	i spose if i wants a gui he should just use ubuntu normal
2007-02-01T15:52:00.000Z	rosalsazs	LjL	might just be slower on old machinies i guess
2007-02-01T15:56:00.000Z	rosalsazs	LjL	do you disagree with cpk1  that u can just install a WM to the sever version?
2007-02-01T15:57:00.000Z	LjL	rosalsazs	no, i don't disagree. actually i said that you could, i'm not sure why you both seemed to interpret it otherwise..
2007-02-01T15:57:00.000Z	LjL	rosalsazs	what i said is, "a GUI can be installed on the server version too. however, if they're going to use the system for *desktop* kind of things, then the server edition is most probably not the right choice"
2007-02-01T16:07:00.000Z	rosalsazs	LjL	sorry i think the first time u said i there may have been a typo
2007-02-01T16:09:00.000Z	LjL	rosalsazs	well, you had asked "would they be better off with ubuntu normal?", and i replied "i don't think, a GUI can be installed on the server version too".   it's everything in the comma ;-) i didn't realize that would be ambiguous
2007-02-01T16:18:00.000Z	rosalsazs	LjL	ah sorry my bad, i see
2007-02-01T16:21:00.000Z	rosalsazs	LjL	 if i have edgy and i run apt-get dist-upgraded will that do anything
2007-02-01T16:25:00.000Z	LjL	rosalsazs	it will download updated packages from the Updates and Security repositories, if there are any and if you have them enabled
2007-02-01T16:26:00.000Z	LjL	rosalsazs	you certainly *should* have them enabled (well, -security at least), and also make sure that you have them enabled for the Universe and Multiverse components, if you have those enabled
