2007-07-13T15:30:00.000Z	MarcoPau	Jordan_U	you mean the one on top of "ins"?
2007-07-13T15:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MarcoPau	You hardly ever *need* to reboot
2007-07-13T15:27:00.000Z	MarcoPau	Jordan_U	heh, but if it freezes... neither keyboard nor mouse respond
2007-07-13T15:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MarcoPau	Does ssh work ( If you have openssh-server installed ) or alt+sysrq+k ?
2007-07-13T15:28:00.000Z	MarcoPau	Jordan_U	I can't really try ssh, having only this computer...
2007-07-13T15:29:00.000Z	MarcoPau	Jordan_U	and what's sysrq?
2007-07-13T15:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MarcoPau	usually your printscreen key
2007-07-13T15:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MarcoPau	Depends on your keyboard
2007-07-13T15:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MarcoPau	Sometimes you need to use function for printscreen to act as sysrq.
2007-07-13T15:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MarcoPau	Try fn+alt+sysrq+k
2007-07-13T15:57:00.000Z	MarcoPau	Jordan_U	I don't have fn... that is a laptop key I suppose
2007-07-13T15:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MarcoPau	Next time you get it working close anything important and see if alt+sysrq+k works normally
2007-07-13T16:00:00.000Z	MarcoPau	Jordan_U	worked. it rebooted X
2007-07-13T16:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MarcoPau	After restarting or from the freeze?
2007-07-13T16:04:00.000Z	MarcoPau	Jordan_U	no, it wasn't frozen
2007-07-13T16:06:00.000Z	MarcoPau	Jordan_U	so the combination is working, but not responding when it freezes... thus, ram test or?
2007-07-13T16:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MarcoPau	What GFX card do you have?
2007-07-13T16:08:00.000Z	MarcoPau	Jordan_U	I'm on a super old machine
2007-07-13T16:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MarcoPau	With my card ( crappy ATI drivers ) I have to disable DRI to keep it from crashing
2007-07-13T16:09:00.000Z	MarcoPau	Jordan_U	that's from xorg.conf?
2007-07-13T16:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	MarcoPau	Yes, it basically disables 3D acceleration
