2008-10-31T04:25:00.000Z	quang1e		hi guys. I'm looking for a tool for hardy to make a live usb, but can't find any packages in synaptic. Can someone point me to the live usb creator deb or something?
2008-10-31T04:25:00.000Z	tovella	quang1e	why not use intrepid to do this?
2008-10-31T04:26:00.000Z	quang1e	tovella	because I want to install Intrepid from usb stick
2008-10-31T04:26:00.000Z	quang1e	tovella	I don't want to wast a CD
2008-10-31T04:27:00.000Z	tovella	quang1e	i thought you said hardy, do you want hardy or intrepid on the flash drive?
2008-10-31T04:27:00.000Z	quang1e	tovella	i want to create intrepid live usb on hardy
2008-10-31T04:29:00.000Z	tovella	quang1e	i see.  i don't know of a .deb that does that in hardy, but if you upgrade (via the internet) you can then create the bootable flash drive you desire (to install on subsequent machines).
2008-10-31T04:29:00.000Z	quang1e	tovella	yeah i want a clean install since i have a seperate home partition anyway
2008-10-31T04:30:00.000Z	tovella	quang1e	agreed... i prefer a clean install, too.
2008-10-31T04:30:00.000Z	tovella	quang1e	do you have another networked machine with 2 or more network cards installed?
2008-10-31T04:31:00.000Z	quang1e	tovella	nope
2008-10-31T04:32:00.000Z	tovella	quang1e	you've already downloaded the cd iso file?
2008-10-31T04:32:00.000Z	quang1e	tovella	yes
2008-10-31T04:33:00.000Z	tovella	quang1e	again i don't know of a .deb that will do it, but there were some instructions on pendrivelinux.org for an older version of ubuntu.  the procedure should be the same.
2008-10-31T04:34:00.000Z	quang1e	tovella	hm ok. Kinda stupid frankly that they don't provide a backport, since it's a pretty common usecase I'd imagine
2008-10-31T04:34:00.000Z	tovella	quang1e	sorry, that should have been pendrivelinux.com
2008-10-31T04:35:00.000Z	tovella	quang1e	it's a new feature of a new version of ubuntu.  a backport may take some time.
2008-10-31T04:36:00.000Z	quang1e	tovella	i can see why that is, but still. It'd make more sense to push it to hardy before intrepid since that's where people upgrade from
2008-10-31T04:37:00.000Z	tovella	quang1e	perhaps you could suggest it to the developers (without calling them stupid).
2008-10-31T04:38:00.000Z	quang1e	tovella	heh didn't mean to imply anything here :)   Actually UNetbootin seems to do what i need
2008-10-31T04:38:00.000Z	tovella	quang1e	cool, UNetbootin... huh?  I'll have to take a look.
