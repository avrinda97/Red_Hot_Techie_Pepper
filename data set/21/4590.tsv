2009-08-19T06:58:00.000Z	a94060	drcheezenstein	usually when you go into bios, it will list the hard drives. Check if your hard drive is detected. If it is,that means something is wrong with bootloader
2009-08-19T07:00:00.000Z	drcheezenstein	a94060	Its not in the boot order
2009-08-19T07:00:00.000Z	a94060	drcheezenstein	is it an scsi drive or something hooked up aside from ide/sata?
2009-08-19T07:01:00.000Z	drcheezenstein	a94060	not sure what kind of drive it is its a laptop harddrive if that helps at all
2009-08-19T07:01:00.000Z	a94060	drcheezenstein	im not sure then. You are able to boot it with the install cd though?
2009-08-19T07:01:00.000Z	a94060	drcheezenstein	are you sure its not just the live environment?
2009-08-19T07:02:00.000Z	drcheezenstein	a94060	No its not the live environment, its actually on the hard drive I goto boot from first harddrive and it boots up
2009-08-19T07:02:00.000Z	drcheezenstein	a94060	I dont even have a live cd its a text based one
