2007-08-04T07:55:00.000Z	vince		Does anyone know a good note taking program ? I am used to use OneNote to take notes for class
2007-08-04T07:57:00.000Z	ShackJack	vince	Most of the apps I know of are like sticky note kind of things ;) Tomboy notes, etc...
2007-08-04T07:57:00.000Z	vince		oh
2007-08-04T07:57:00.000Z	vince		bummer

2007-08-04T08:00:00.000Z	vince		thanks so much
2007-08-04T08:01:00.000Z	ShackJack	vince	Not quite - it's KDE based :P
2007-08-04T08:02:00.000Z	vince	ShackJack	yea I know but I am going to check it out and if it seems like it will do the job, then I will switch to KDE
2007-08-04T08:02:00.000Z	ShackJack	vince	Oh, you don't have to switch to KDE it'll run unsder GNOME - just loads extra libs, etc...
2007-08-04T08:03:00.000Z	vince		shackjack: sweet
2007-08-04T08:03:00.000Z	ShackJack	vince	There's also something called notebook=gtk2 though I'm not sure as robust...
2007-08-04T08:05:00.000Z	vince		shackjack: :) I just need to get a new wireless card and I will be set
2007-08-04T08:05:00.000Z	ShackJack	vince	What's wrong with current one?
2007-08-04T08:06:00.000Z	vince		shackjack: I bought it a long time ago, its made by Microsoft and has some weird chipset that Ubuntu doesnt like, I found a forum thread dealing with it, but the solution is way over my head
2007-08-04T08:07:00.000Z	vince		shackjack: something with a wrapper or som10
2007-08-04T08:07:00.000Z	ShackJack	vince	Gotcha - there's a good troubleshooting guide here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessTroubleShootingGuide and ndswrapper info here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper
2007-08-04T08:07:00.000Z	vince		shackjack: thats it
2007-08-04T08:08:00.000Z	ShackJack	vince	That's a pain... if you can't get it to work, I've had good luck with Intel wireless 3945 chips...
