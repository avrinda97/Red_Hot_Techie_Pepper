2011-08-07T02:01:00.000Z	HSL		Hi, I keep getting this error: svn: warning: cannot set LC_CTYPE locale
2011-08-07T02:01:00.000Z	HSL		svn: warning: environment variable LC_CTYPE is UTF-8
2011-08-07T02:01:00.000Z	HSL		svn: warning: please check that your locale name is correct
2011-08-07T02:01:00.000Z	HSL		and I can't get rid of it.
2011-08-07T02:01:00.000Z	HSL		anyone got a clue?
2011-08-07T02:01:00.000Z	Seveas	HSL	pastebin the output of 'env'
2011-08-07T02:03:00.000Z	HSL	Seveas	http://pastebin.com/EiUkNBgP
2011-08-07T02:04:00.000Z	Seveas	HSL	your LC_CTYPE is wrong. try this in the shell: unset LC_CTYPE
2011-08-07T02:08:00.000Z	HSL	Seveas	this is what is in /etc/environment
2011-08-07T02:09:00.000Z	Seveas	HSL	that looks ok, must be one of the other files then
2011-08-07T02:09:00.000Z	HSL	Seveas	LC_CTYPE is not in any of those files
2011-08-07T02:11:00.000Z	Seveas	HSL	try this in the shell: set -x; . ~/.bashrc > bashrc_out 2>&1
2011-08-07T02:12:00.000Z	Seveas	HSL	and pastebin the resulting bashrc_out file

2011-08-07T02:16:00.000Z	Seveas	HSL	ok, looks like something did that just once. Can you open a new shell and see what LC_CTYPE is set to there?
2011-08-07T02:17:00.000Z	HSL	Seveas	LC_CTYPE=UTF-8
2011-08-07T02:17:00.000Z	Seveas	HSL	grep CTYPE -R /etc
2011-08-07T02:17:00.000Z	Seveas	HSL	also, grep CTYPE ~/.??*

2011-08-07T02:21:00.000Z	HSL	Seveas	isn't there a way to set this systemwide?
2011-08-07T02:22:00.000Z	Seveas	HSL	not unless you know where it's set to the wrong value
