2010-05-20T10:26:00.000Z	torshido		hi all, how can I create an installation repo for my local network, using the DVD I just downloaded?
2010-05-20T10:27:00.000Z	BlAck6j73	torshido	 is it just one  dvd?
2010-05-20T10:27:00.000Z	torshido	BlAck6j73	yeah, the one from the ubuntu.com
2010-05-20T10:30:00.000Z	BlAck6j73	torshido	 use apt-cdrom
2010-05-20T10:30:00.000Z	torshido	BlAck6j73	I just want to install a lab, I dont care about updates, I'll install a proxy later
2010-05-20T10:30:00.000Z	torshido	BlAck6j73	thanks
2010-05-20T10:32:00.000Z	torshido	BlAck6j73	I don't think apt-cdrom is helpful in my case, I need to host a local repo for a lot of machines
2010-05-20T10:33:00.000Z	BlAck6j73	torshido	 you could use FTP
2010-05-20T10:34:00.000Z	BlAck6j73	torshido	 or even apt-mirror
2010-05-20T10:34:00.000Z	torshido	BlAck6j73	just copy the DVD content to an http pr ftp server, thats all? I am an Red Hat Certified Engineer, so I know how to do this in RHEL or Fedora
2010-05-20T10:34:00.000Z	torshido	BlAck6j73	Can I populate apt-mirror from the DVD?
2010-05-20T10:37:00.000Z	BlAck6j73	torshido	 how about this     http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=2595774&postcount=2
2010-05-20T10:38:00.000Z	torshido	BlAck6j73	that would work for one machine
2010-05-20T10:39:00.000Z	torshido	BlAck6j73	I loop mounted the DVD iso file to my httpd server, and I'm booting the mini.iso image right now... It looks like it is working
2010-05-20T10:39:00.000Z	torshido	BlAck6j73	very easy
2010-05-20T10:40:00.000Z	torshido	BlAck6j73	I just had to choose a manual mirror configuration and point it to my httpd server
2010-05-20T10:41:00.000Z	BlAck6j73	torshido	 yeah   thats good    I thought you might not have a web server setup  hence   FTP!
2010-05-20T10:41:00.000Z	torshido	BlAck6j73	what's the difference between mini.iso and the alternate cd?
2010-05-20T10:43:00.000Z	BlAck6j73	torshido	 dont know!    I think mini is for net install and alternate has diff software on it
2010-05-20T10:43:00.000Z	torshido	BlAck6j73	thanks for your help. I'm a Fedora guy myself but I have a lot of respect for Ubuntu
2010-05-20T10:44:00.000Z	BlAck6j73	torshido	 np
