2011-05-15T07:35:00.000Z	MethedMan		how do i make a symlink from "computer 1" to "computer 2" over a network using "sshfs"?
2011-05-15T07:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MethedMan	you'd need to mount the sshfs
2011-05-15T07:37:00.000Z	MethedMan	ActionParsnip	i think that you might be one or two steps ahead of me.  i have an an "sftp" connection from my current computer to "computer 2" that appears to be mounted.
2011-05-15T07:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MethedMan	then copy the data to the mount point and it will copy to the server
2011-05-15T07:38:00.000Z	MethedMan	ActionParsnip	i want to do this via the terminal and i want to make symlinks
2011-05-15T07:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MethedMan	then you can make a symlink to the mountpoint (or a subfolder within) to wherever you want
2011-05-15T07:40:00.000Z	MethedMan	ActionParsnip	I am not sure where the sftp is mounted in my filesystem.  unfortunately i used the gui "connect to server" option that is standard with ubuntu.
2011-05-15T07:42:00.000Z	MethedMan	ActionParsnip	found it in ~/.gvfs
2011-05-15T07:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MethedMan	you can add an entry in /etc/fstab
2011-05-15T07:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MethedMan	you may need to add:   mount -a    in /etc/rc.local  as the fstab file is processed before the network comes up
2011-05-15T07:50:00.000Z	MethedMan	ActionParsnip	thanks for the advice.  the last bit about mounting is over my head though.
2011-05-15T07:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MethedMan	have a  look online, you'll find example lines you can tweak and add
2011-05-15T09:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MethedMan	I'd ask in #apple
2011-05-15T09:30:00.000Z	MethedMan	ActionParsnip	thanks
2011-05-15T09:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MethedMan	check the license too :)
2011-05-15T09:31:00.000Z	MethedMan	ActionParsnip	what do you mean check the license?
2011-05-15T09:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MethedMan	the mac license may not allow virtualizing the OS
2011-05-15T09:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MethedMan	you still need to satisfy the license
2011-05-20T16:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MethedMan	add it in /etc/rc.local
2011-05-20T17:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MethedMan	thats assuming it needs running before x runs
2011-05-20T17:01:00.000Z	MethedMan	ActionParsnip	is there a good source/book/website that details the ubuntu/linux file system along with functionality and purpose.
