2012-08-12T00:41:00.000Z	W4sp	R1cochet	Could you check ls -la /dev/pts and does /var/run/utmp exist?
2012-08-12T00:46:00.000Z	R1cochet	W4sp	only thing in /dev/pts is "0"
2012-08-12T00:48:00.000Z	W4sp	R1cochet	That's not sufficient and is clearly wrong. That's why you have it. Out of my curiosity. The error message is a copy/paste? I wonder if the auther couldn't spell.
2012-08-12T00:49:00.000Z	R1cochet	W4sp	simcut@whatever:~$ ls -la /dev/pts
2012-08-12T00:54:00.000Z	W4sp	R1cochet	Once you have pastebin that please can I also ask if you mount command shows something like devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,noexec,nosuid,gid=5,mode=0620)?
2012-08-12T00:56:00.000Z	R1cochet	W4sp	how do i check the mount command?
2012-08-12T00:56:00.000Z	W4sp	R1cochet	You type in mount in a terminal. IT shows you the mounted devices.

2012-08-12T01:02:00.000Z	W4sp	R1cochet	I read it. IT is clearly wrong and also wrongly mounted. See my suggestions on how it should look. You mentioned it is a VPS. Given that you have pasted it I assume you have full root access. However, I would suggest you contact the rack space provider. Explain to them that /dev/ptmx isn't properly mounted on /dev/pts and therefore you ran out of pseudo terminals.
2012-08-12T01:02:00.000Z	W4sp	R1cochet	This is how it should look like: devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,noexec,nosuid,gid=5,mode=0620)
2012-08-12T01:03:00.000Z	R1cochet	W4sp	i think i mounted it last night myself
2012-08-12T01:04:00.000Z	W4sp	R1cochet	You...? Well, did you install the system? It shoudl be there just by default. Nothing much you can do wrong to be honest.
2012-08-12T01:06:00.000Z	W4sp	R1cochet	As I said, the best is to approach the provider and explain the situation. This is the root cause why your utmp throws the execption.
2012-08-12T01:11:00.000Z	W4sp	R1cochet	Besides, loggin in as root is not a bad thing. At some point a system needs to be administered. Don't blame him/her for that. ;-)
2012-08-12T01:14:00.000Z	W4sp	R1cochet	If that's for me please put my name into it. It highlights here and we have >1500 user online.
2012-08-12T01:14:00.000Z	W4sp	R1cochet	Is it can or can't ...?
2012-08-12T01:14:00.000Z	R1cochet	W4sp	sorry. it was for anyone that had any idea how to help.
2012-08-12T01:15:00.000Z	R1cochet	W4sp	ssh: connect to host 67.23.238.37 port 22: Connection timed out
2012-08-12T01:15:00.000Z	W4sp	R1cochet	That's perhaps something we would expect as there are no pts available.
2012-08-12T01:16:00.000Z	R1cochet	W4sp	so if i cant login via ssh, how can i administer?
2012-08-12T01:17:00.000Z	W4sp	R1cochet	You can't. Speak to the provider. I would only repeat what I have said to you earlier.
