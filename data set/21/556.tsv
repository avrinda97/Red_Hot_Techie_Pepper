2011-10-12T07:31:00.000Z	ubiq2	xpress	do you have 2 wifi devices?
2011-10-12T07:32:00.000Z	ubiq2	xpress	so the command could be wlan1 not wlan0
2011-10-12T07:33:00.000Z	xpress	ubiq2	where i have to put wlan0 ^^
2011-10-12T07:37:00.000Z	ubiq2	xpress	i don't know which commands you've been executing but wlan0 could be your internal wlan chip and wlan1 an external wifi-stick. that means that you are reffering to the wrong device with specific commands.
2011-10-12T07:47:00.000Z	ubiq2	xpress	check out wiki.ubuntuusers.de/WLAN/madwifi
2011-10-12T07:55:00.000Z	xpress	ubiq2	look man xpress@xpress:~/.source$ wlanconfig ath0
