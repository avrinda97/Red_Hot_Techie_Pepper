2008-12-04T13:06:00.000Z	d-b		ok so no one can tell me. that is just great. nice ubuntu server install makes your secondardy installs on another disk redundant and kills them off. how nice.
2008-12-04T13:06:00.000Z	maco	d-b	what's the question?
2008-12-04T13:07:00.000Z	maco	d-b	a grub error?
2008-12-04T13:08:00.000Z	maco	d-b	is it grub thats giving the error? what disk did you install grub on? are there both ide and sata drives involved?
2008-12-04T13:09:00.000Z	d-b	maco	two hda disks (ide ) i assumed grub was only modified on the disk i installed on. that's all.
2008-12-04T13:09:00.000Z	maco	d-b	which disk did you tell it to install on?
2008-12-04T13:09:00.000Z	maco	d-b	er, which disk did you tell *grub* to install on?
2008-12-04T13:10:00.000Z	d-b	maco	wasn't given an option. so i assume the one i put ubuntu on.
2008-12-04T13:11:00.000Z	maco	d-b	the option of where to install grub is in the advanced settings on the last page of the installer
2008-12-04T13:12:00.000Z	d-b	maco	mmm i wasn't in advanced installer i was in the normal one i believe.
2008-12-04T13:12:00.000Z	maco	d-b	the normal desktop installer has an advanced button at the end for configuring that
2008-12-04T13:13:00.000Z	maco	d-b	-_- oh what helpful grub error. 21 apparently means "unknown boot error"
2008-12-04T13:13:00.000Z	d-b	maco	looks like my cable came loose after all then (i think).
2008-12-04T13:47:00.000Z	maco	d-b	rc? rc of *what*?
2008-12-04T13:47:00.000Z	maco	d-b	there's no current release candidate
2008-12-04T13:49:00.000Z	maco	d-b	uh, well we released in october...
2008-12-04T13:50:00.000Z	d-b	maco	mmm the bug goes back to previous releases
2008-12-04T13:50:00.000Z	maco	d-b	is that the wrong-disk-when-sata-and-ide-both-there one?
2008-12-04T13:50:00.000Z	maco	d-b	oh thats intereting
2008-12-04T13:51:00.000Z	maco	d-b	they do give that option in the advanced settings
2008-12-04T13:52:00.000Z	maco	d-b	er, wouldn't "i need to install on not-th-first-disk" be in the "contains the word 'need' category"?
