2008-04-18T01:55:00.000Z	anya_		has anyone ever had a similar problem?
2008-04-18T01:56:00.000Z	hubuntu	anya_	is the wlan working with other connectiuon types than WPA2?
2008-04-18T01:56:00.000Z	anya_	hubuntu	yes, if i disable encryption it works
2008-04-18T01:56:00.000Z	anya_		but not with wpa2 enabled
2008-04-18T01:56:00.000Z	anya_		i have a fritz box
2008-04-18T01:57:00.000Z	hubuntu		I have had that problem.. At uni they use WPA Enterprise, but the wlan card I use didn't work there
2008-04-18T01:57:00.000Z	hubuntu		it's because of the driver, it probably does not support WPAx even though it work without encription or with WEP
2008-04-18T01:57:00.000Z	hubuntu		sorry :|
2008-04-18T01:57:00.000Z	hubuntu	anya_	not much to do with that, other than try another card
2008-04-18T01:59:00.000Z	anya_	hubuntu	i have no other card
2008-04-18T01:59:00.000Z	anya_		it is a normal centrino card, normally it should work
2008-04-18T02:00:00.000Z	hubuntu	anya_	YOu could try to google the issue
