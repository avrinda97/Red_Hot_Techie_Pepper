2012-04-03T18:22:00.000Z	angs		is there any image loader server like Northon Ghost that I can use on ubuntu to load image to remote computers?

2012-04-03T18:23:00.000Z	angs	bekks	thanks
2012-04-03T19:18:00.000Z	bekks	angs	Partimage, clonezilla, dd
2012-04-05T21:42:00.000Z	bekks	angs	Which error exactly?
2012-04-05T21:44:00.000Z	bekks	angs	Thats an error occuring when the monitor connected isnt capable of the graphics mode you wanted. Thats all.
2012-04-05T21:44:00.000Z	bekks	angs	It doesnt stop Ubuntu from booting, loading, starting or functioning.
2012-04-05T21:45:00.000Z	angs	bekks	is it about BIOS or ubuntu?
2012-04-05T21:45:00.000Z	bekks	angs	No.
2012-04-05T21:45:00.000Z	bekks	angs	It's about the monitor not being capable of the desired graphics mode.
2012-04-05T21:48:00.000Z	bekks	angs	How do you see that error without a monitor connected?
2012-04-06T15:11:00.000Z	bekks	angs	Unless you have a bios to power it on at a give point in time, you cannot do so with ubuntu. Just put your finger on the power button to power it on.
2012-04-06T15:12:00.000Z	angs	bekks	is it possible if ubuntu sleeps rather than shutdown? In this case, is it possible to schedule wake up and sleep times?
2012-04-06T15:12:00.000Z	bekks	angs	No.
2012-04-06T15:13:00.000Z	bekks	angs	You can schedule the shutdown, but why dont you just shut it down when finished? Instead of loosing work, when trying to write the last sentence of a letter?
2012-04-06T15:15:00.000Z	angs	bekks	I would like to implement wakeup and sleep schedule for an embedded board, and it will work remotely. I just wondered if there is any command to schedule a linux's working hours
2012-04-06T15:15:00.000Z	bekks	angs	The answer still is "No".
2012-07-02T00:20:00.000Z	bekks	angs	No.
2012-07-02T00:23:00.000Z	bekks	angs	You cant use scp over a serial connection, unless you set up something like the already mentioned SLIP, or similar.
2012-07-07T16:09:00.000Z	bekks	angs	It doesnt have other compilers unless you installed some, which you would know of.
2012-07-07T16:10:00.000Z	angs	bekks	thanks, I am using a ubuntu image, is there any command to see the existing compilers?
