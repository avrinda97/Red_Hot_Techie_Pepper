2009-05-01T05:34:00.000Z	Zzeiss	uriel_	When you plug in the second portable hard drive (I assume it's a USB device) what shows up in /var/log/messages ?
2009-05-01T05:34:00.000Z	uriel_	Zzeiss	how would i check it?
2009-05-01T05:34:00.000Z	Zzeiss	uriel_	Specifically, reboot (with the second drive disconnected) ... open a terminal, type "tail -f /var/log/messages", and then plug the drive in.
2009-05-01T05:35:00.000Z	Zzeiss	uriel_	you could try it without rebooting, if you were sure your USB was OK .
2009-05-01T05:35:00.000Z	uriel_	Zzeiss	ill try right now
2009-05-01T05:36:00.000Z	Zzeiss	uriel_	what I'd be worrying about is that the drive partition table has been corrupted.
2009-05-01T05:37:00.000Z	Zzeiss	uriel_	OK then... what did the "tail" say?
2009-05-01T05:37:00.000Z	uriel_	Zzeiss	spesificly
2009-05-01T05:38:00.000Z	Zzeiss	uriel_	 you should have gotten some USB connection messages.   Those are NOT happy USB messages.
2009-05-01T05:38:00.000Z	uriel_	Zzeiss	haha i got muted idk what should i do?
2009-05-01T05:39:00.000Z	Zzeiss	uriel_	Somehow your USB subsystem has become very confused.  Maybe try rebooting without the disk, then start "tail" and then plug it in?
2009-05-01T05:44:00.000Z	uriel_	Zzeiss	: what was that code again?
2009-05-01T05:45:00.000Z	Zzeiss	uriel_	 tail -f /var/log/messages
2009-05-01T05:46:00.000Z	uriel_	Zzeiss	basicly the same thing happened
2009-05-01T05:47:00.000Z	uriel_	Zzeiss	also i just remembered i had installed 8.04 on that drive also previosly could this be a reason for the problem
2009-05-01T05:47:00.000Z	uriel_	Zzeiss	ill have to get back to u srry
2009-05-01T05:47:00.000Z	Zzeiss	uriel_	Not likely to be the reason.  Unless you clobbered the partition table.
2009-05-01T05:47:00.000Z	Zzeiss	uriel_	try it again in windows, to see if the partition table is trashed.
2009-05-01T05:48:00.000Z	uriel_	Zzeiss	thnks for the help so far i g2gbye
