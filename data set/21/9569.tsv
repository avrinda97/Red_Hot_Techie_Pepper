2006-02-22T11:49:00.000Z	netsurf3		gahhhhh i cant get ndiswrapper to load on boot it just wont work :(
2006-02-22T11:49:00.000Z	netsurf3		hmm
2006-02-22T11:49:00.000Z	netsurf3		ndiswrappers for wireless devices?
2006-02-22T11:50:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	netsurf3	yes, its basically windows .dll file wrapped so that linux can use it
2006-02-22T11:51:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	netsurf3	did it say it will load it at boot?
2006-02-22T11:51:00.000Z	netsurf3	hatake_kakashi	i used the -m funtions
2006-02-22T11:51:00.000Z	netsurf3	hatake_kakashi	also the usb support just seems to die after a while
2006-02-22T11:51:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	netsurf3	try making it verbose
2006-02-22T11:52:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	netsurf3	I presume there has to be a way to make it spit out verbose information
2006-02-22T11:53:00.000Z	netsurf3	hatake_kakashi	you can turn off the splash on boot but other than that i dont know
2006-02-22T11:53:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	netsurf3	check under the ndiswrapper to see what sort of arguments/functions are there available
2006-02-22T11:54:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	netsurf3	ok what's -m?
2006-02-22T11:57:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	netsurf3	hmm
2006-02-22T11:57:00.000Z	netsurf3	hatake_kakashi	yeah......
2006-02-22T11:57:00.000Z	netsurf3	hatake_kakashi	there is no modprobe.conf though
2006-02-22T11:57:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	netsurf3	that doesn't seem to be muchof a help
2006-02-22T12:00:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	netsurf3	I think checking with google may help
2006-02-22T12:01:00.000Z	netsurf3	hatake_kakashi	i had a google run and found nothing close to useful :(
2006-02-22T12:02:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	netsurf3	blah.. well my knowledge with ndiswrapper is somewhat limited
2006-02-22T12:03:00.000Z	netsurf3	hatake_kakashi	strange that even debian could run the ndis on boot though
2006-02-22T12:10:00.000Z	netsurf3	hatake_kakashi	hmm i have it loading on boot but i need the wlan0 to work with ifupdown
