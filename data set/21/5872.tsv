2008-01-11T12:37:00.000Z	robc4		tty7
2008-01-11T12:38:00.000Z	robc4		creed, have you hit alt f1 and see if there was something running on tty1?
2008-01-11T12:39:00.000Z	Creed	robc4	startup info is on tty1 for me.
2008-01-11T12:39:00.000Z	robc4		yea, tty1 is normally what you use for a console
2008-01-11T12:39:00.000Z	Creed		Old teletype machines couldn't operate as teh first console, so Linux honors the same restriction.
2008-01-11T12:39:00.000Z	robc4		there are 6 stty sessions that load for a standard linux system
2008-01-11T12:39:00.000Z	Creed		That is the answer that makes most sense to me.
2008-01-11T12:40:00.000Z	robc4		so when you load an X system (gnome, kde, etc etc) it uses tty7
2008-01-11T12:41:00.000Z	Creed	robc4	/ Flannel http://pastebin.ca/850538 This is the question...none of the answers make sense to me.
2008-01-11T12:41:00.000Z	robc4		all of those are wrong minus the one about terminals
2008-01-11T12:42:00.000Z	robc4		at least as far as my experiences have gone
2008-01-11T12:42:00.000Z	Creed	robc4	lol so none of those is the correct answer?
2008-01-11T12:42:00.000Z	robc4		3 is
2008-01-11T12:42:00.000Z	robc4		1 is wrong
2008-01-11T12:42:00.000Z	robc4		2 is wrong, it uses tty7
2008-01-11T12:43:00.000Z	robc4		4 is def. wrong
2008-01-11T12:43:00.000Z	robc4	charlz	there is a problem running .net applications on wine, go check out winehq for more info
2008-01-11T12:43:00.000Z	Creed	robc4	thats what I thought.
2008-01-11T12:44:00.000Z	robc4		creed, is sounds like your IT guys are stuck 10 years ago
2008-01-11T12:44:00.000Z	robc4		creed, and are too proud to now lose the now useless info
2008-01-11T12:45:00.000Z	Creed	robc4	yeah :-/ Stupid ass instructor...wont even let us use Fedora 8 even though its perfectly fine...making us use FC6.
