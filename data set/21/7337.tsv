2010-09-20T09:58:00.000Z	Chippy		I don't understand some of this.
2010-09-20T09:59:00.000Z	Chippy		I'm just going to reinstall windows...
2010-09-20T09:59:00.000Z	Chippy		I don't understand any of this.
2010-09-20T10:00:00.000Z	Chippy		but why are they on my computer?
2010-09-20T10:00:00.000Z	Chippy		who put them there and how?
2010-09-20T10:00:00.000Z	Chippy		but how did i get the rootkit?
2010-09-20T10:00:00.000Z	Chippy		sounds like a virus to me
2010-09-20T10:00:00.000Z	bobstro	Chippy	 it sounds like you bypassed one of the primary protections.
2010-09-20T10:01:00.000Z	Chippy	bobstro	i don't want to have to type my password every time i want to do something.
2010-09-20T10:01:00.000Z	bobstro	Chippy	 well, when you do something that requires admin privileges. that's not everything.
2010-09-20T10:01:00.000Z	bobstro	Chippy	 so i think that's the answer to your question.
2010-09-20T10:02:00.000Z	bobstro	Chippy	 that's just like making a windows user admin.
2010-09-20T10:03:00.000Z	bobstro	Chippy	 well, there is! that was the big new security feature set they introduced.
2010-09-20T10:04:00.000Z	bobstro	Chippy	 did you open up servers or such to the internet?
2010-09-20T10:04:00.000Z	bobstro	Chippy	 hmm. depends on how well you protect it.
2010-09-20T10:05:00.000Z	bobstro	Chippy	 well, if you didn't use good passwords and such.
2010-09-20T10:06:00.000Z	bobstro	Chippy	 you could also have restricted it, used non-default ports or done other things. if you've got weak security, then opening a door like ssh is not a good idea.
2010-09-20T10:06:00.000Z	bobstro	Chippy	 my point is that you can do similarly unfortunate things using windows is all.
2010-09-20T10:07:00.000Z	bobstro	Chippy	 it's like seatbelts. you can BE secure.
2010-09-20T10:07:00.000Z	bobstro	Chippy	 as opposed to other OS that allow users to unknowingly let bad stuff in.
2010-09-20T10:08:00.000Z	bobstro	Chippy	 you basically turned off the protection setting uid to 0.
