2006-06-24T10:59:00.000Z	Flawless		Hi all - I'm having a real problem with dead keys on my keyboard. Even though I don't use "nodeadkeys", and have double-checked that it's not in my xorg.conf, I still can't use dead keys!
2006-06-24T11:00:00.000Z	Flawless		I need dead keys to write danish :-/
2006-06-24T11:00:00.000Z	Flawless		I'd like any hints or tips
2006-06-24T11:00:00.000Z	Flawless		This problem is on dapper, i386 as well as amd64
2006-06-24T11:02:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Flawless	tried kb prefs?
2006-06-24T11:02:00.000Z	Flawless	Frogzoo	where? kcontrol? yes - didn't work
2006-06-24T11:02:00.000Z	Flawless	Frogzoo	strangely, though, it works on the ttys?
2006-06-24T11:02:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Flawless	this is in kde? or gnome?
2006-06-24T11:02:00.000Z	Flawless	Frogzoo	s/?/!/
2006-06-24T11:03:00.000Z	Flawless	Frogzoo	all of X - but I use kubuntu, so KDE
2006-06-24T11:04:00.000Z	Flawless	Frogzoo	any idea? :)
2006-06-24T11:04:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Flawless	not strange - the linux kernel does keymappings, then X does it's own mapping on top of that - not sure how you set kb layout in kde, but there must be something
2006-06-24T11:04:00.000Z	Flawless	Frogzoo	I've tried xinit, with just "xterm" in .xinitrc, meaning that no programs that mess with the keyboard are started
2006-06-24T11:04:00.000Z	Flawless	Frogzoo	then, I used a config that worked 100% in debian, and which should work according to "every site on the internet"
2006-06-24T11:05:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Flawless	X messes with kb settings
2006-06-24T11:05:00.000Z	Flawless	Frogzoo	I get local letters just fine, but no dead keys
2006-06-24T11:05:00.000Z	Flawless	Frogzoo	these are the X settings that worked on debian - does X mess with them in another way on (k)ubuntu? :)
2006-06-24T11:05:00.000Z	Flawless		!iso8859-1
2006-06-24T11:05:00.000Z	Flawless		!iso-8859-1
2006-06-24T11:06:00.000Z	Frogzoo		!fishing
2006-06-24T11:06:00.000Z	Flawless	Frogzoo	sorry :)
