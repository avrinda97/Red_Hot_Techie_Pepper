2009-11-17T20:56:00.000Z	trex22		i'm sick of windows 7
2009-11-17T20:58:00.000Z	trex22		x3 i've used it too many times before it was much easier to learn than windows
2009-11-17T20:58:00.000Z	trex22		the only thing keeping me with MS is gaming
2009-11-17T20:59:00.000Z	trex22		x3 ubuntu is user friendly.. i don't want to drive my self crazy
2009-11-17T21:01:00.000Z	trex22		x3 someday .. maybe soon ubuntu will replace windows as a desktop OS
2009-11-17T21:01:00.000Z	trex22		i used pupplylinux many times because it's small and you can remaster the DVDRW once you make changes to it
2009-11-17T21:01:00.000Z	trex22		and it runs from the system memory
2009-11-17T21:01:00.000Z	trex22		i wish they made the same to ubuntu
2009-11-17T21:02:00.000Z	trex22		how?
2009-11-17T21:02:00.000Z	kyle6513	trex22	i never liked puppy linux for the sheer fact that the puplets are hell to get working :P
2009-11-17T21:02:00.000Z	trex22		puppylinux it's easy
2009-11-17T21:02:00.000Z	trex22		but ubuntu support wider selection of hardware
2009-11-17T21:02:00.000Z	trex22		easier
