2012-07-17T00:36:00.000Z	qmr		my external monitor is to the left of my laptop display.  can I move Unity dock to external display?
2012-07-17T00:37:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	qmr	I think if you make the external display the primary display it will move
2012-07-17T00:38:00.000Z	qmr	ActionPa1snip	how do I make it primary?  What does that mean?
2012-07-17T00:39:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	qmr	in display settings, make the external display primary, if you use an nvidia gpu then you can set it in nvidia-settings
2012-07-17T00:40:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	qmr	try right clicking the external disply....
2012-07-17T00:41:00.000Z	qmr	ActionPa1snip	nothing happens when right clickcing
2012-07-17T00:45:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	qmr	can you drag the displays around?
2012-07-17T00:45:00.000Z	qmr	ActionPa1snip	yes
2012-07-17T00:45:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	qmr	ok then drag the monitor to the left of the laptop, does it make the Unity move?
2012-07-17T00:47:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	qmr	seems there is a launcher placement drop down. Do you see taht?
2012-07-17T00:48:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	qmr	its ok, i use few apps so it works for me
2012-07-17T00:48:00.000Z	qmr	ActionPa1snip	I don't have any dropdowns besides res, refresh, and rotation
2012-07-17T00:49:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	qmr	what is the output of:  lsb_release -sc
2012-07-17T00:50:00.000Z	qmr	ActionPa1snip	natty
2012-07-17T00:50:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	qmr	ahhh, let me search better
2012-07-17T00:50:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	qmr	Precise has a nice switcher in its display config
2012-07-17T00:51:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	qmr	natty doesn't have much support left in it either, you may want to upgrade soon
2012-07-17T00:51:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	qmr	try:    xrandr --output VGA-0 --primary
2012-07-17T00:52:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	qmr	you may need to run:  xrandr  to see the display names
