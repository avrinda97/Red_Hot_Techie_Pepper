2006-03-19T16:49:00.000Z	kage		i typed "mount -t ntfs /dev/hda1 /mnt" and I get this :
2006-03-19T16:49:00.000Z	kage		hold on a sec I messed up XD
2006-03-19T16:51:00.000Z	kage		I type in "sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/hda1 /mnt" and I get this message: mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hda1, missing codepage or other error
2006-03-19T16:51:00.000Z	kage		any help?
2006-03-19T16:53:00.000Z	soundray	kage	maybe you don't have an NTFS on hda1?
2006-03-19T16:53:00.000Z	soundray	kage	is it on hda1 for sure?
2006-03-19T16:56:00.000Z	soundray	kage	what partition is Ubuntu root on? (First line of your "mount" output)
2006-03-19T16:57:00.000Z	kage	soundray	1sec lol
2006-03-19T16:58:00.000Z	soundray	kage	have you got the ntfsprogs package installed?
2006-03-20T17:00:00.000Z	soundray	kage	try installing it and run ntfsinfo /dev/hda1
2006-03-20T17:03:00.000Z	soundray	kage	I don't have an NTFS here to check this out on... Perhaps it helps if you have a look at the info in /usr/share/doc/ntfsprogs and the manpages.
2006-03-20T17:04:00.000Z	kage	soundray	it says I must specify an inode to learn more
2006-03-20T17:07:00.000Z	soundray	kage	try some of the other ntfsprogs... e.g. ntfsls -a -d /dev/hda1
2006-03-20T17:08:00.000Z	kage	soundray	it says it cant mount device :invalid argument
2006-03-20T17:09:00.000Z	soundray	kage	it sounds bad. Does Windows still boot?
2006-03-20T17:09:00.000Z	kage	soundray	yes
2006-03-20T17:11:00.000Z	soundray	kage	have you compressed your NTFS perhaps?
2006-03-20T17:12:00.000Z	kage	soundray	i don't think so..I'm like 90% sure I haven't
2006-03-20T17:13:00.000Z	soundray	kage	sorry, I haven't got any other suggestions.
2006-03-20T17:13:00.000Z	kage	soundray	no problem, I'll figure it out eventually XD
2006-03-20T17:13:00.000Z	soundray	kage	I hope you do.
