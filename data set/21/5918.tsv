2007-07-08T06:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cozierfamily	Have you been using sudo with GUI apps instead of gksudo ?
2007-07-08T06:12:00.000Z	cozierfamily	Jordan_U	just sudo why?
2007-07-08T06:13:00.000Z	cozierfamily	Jordan_U	okay thanks for the tip

2007-07-08T06:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cozierfamily	Yes
2007-07-08T06:15:00.000Z	cozierfamily	Jordan_U	cool,
2007-07-08T06:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cozierfamily	you need to run "sudo chown <your username> ~/dmrc"
2007-07-08T06:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cozierfamily	and "sudo chmod 644 ~/dmrc"
2007-07-08T06:16:00.000Z	cozierfamily	Jordan_U	i have two username's i'm using the cozierfamily account atm, my other one's the mattycoze username - which is me, could I just put in "mattycoze"?
2007-07-08T06:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cozierfamily	Sorry, there should be a "." before dmrc
2007-07-08T06:17:00.000Z	cozierfamily	Jordan_U	kk,
2007-07-08T06:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cozierfamily	Use whatever user corresponds to that home folder.
2007-07-08T06:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cozierfamily	So for /home/fred/.dmrc use fred and use bob for /home/bob/.dmrc
2007-07-08T06:20:00.000Z	cozierfamily	Jordan_U	i got; cozierfamily is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.
2007-07-08T06:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cozierfamily	You will need to run those commands as a user that has admin privileges
2007-07-08T06:21:00.000Z	cozierfamily	Jordan_U	ahh i see - i'll go try in the other account
2007-07-08T06:21:00.000Z	cozierfamily	Jordan_U	i'll brb logging in as "mattycoze"
