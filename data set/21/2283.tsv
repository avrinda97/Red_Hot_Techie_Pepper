2009-11-25T06:11:00.000Z	knuthy	m3ga	do you have a /dev/md0?
2009-11-25T06:13:00.000Z	m3ga	knuthy	if i boot to a rescue usb stick the /dev/md0 device gets started.
2009-11-25T06:14:00.000Z	knuthy	m3ga	hm, you mean that it's started on the usb stick install, and not on your normal install?
2009-11-25T06:15:00.000Z	m3ga	knuthy	yes
2009-11-25T06:16:00.000Z	knuthy	m3ga	well actually I see that there's no initramfs on the /boot
2009-11-25T06:16:00.000Z	knuthy	m3ga	ah, initrd,
2009-11-25T06:17:00.000Z	knuthy	m3ga	btw, you have raid?
2009-11-25T06:17:00.000Z	m3ga	knuthy	yes, 3 * raid1 partitions
2009-11-25T06:19:00.000Z	knuthy	m3ga	on my Arch I do have the md0, but not on ubuntu, I just noticed that ...
2009-11-25T06:19:00.000Z	knuthy	m3ga	probably the kernel not compiled supporting it, but I don't think so ...
2009-11-25T06:20:00.000Z	knuthy	m3ga	it probably didn't detect your raid :s
2009-11-25T06:25:00.000Z	knuthy	m3ga	on the wiki, there's a way to activate raid on ubuntu
2009-11-25T06:25:00.000Z	m3ga	knuthy	wiki? link?
2009-11-25T06:25:00.000Z	knuthy	m3ga	you understand french? :p
2009-11-25T06:25:00.000Z	knuthy	m3ga	wait I check if there's an english one :)
2009-11-25T06:26:00.000Z	m3ga	knuthy	sorry, no :-)
2009-11-25T06:29:00.000Z	knuthy	m3ga	the french link : http://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/installation/raid1_software , use a translator :p
2009-11-25T06:29:00.000Z	knuthy	m3ga	the commands doesn't change ;)
2009-11-25T06:43:00.000Z	knuthy	m3ga	did the link help you?
2009-11-25T06:43:00.000Z	m3ga	knuthy	sorry no. i've done all of that stuff
2009-11-25T06:44:00.000Z	knuthy	m3ga	he gets the md0 on at a certain point
