2006-03-11T15:27:00.000Z	palc1		guys, do you know if it's possible and permitted to edit the repositories list on the Ubuntu InstallCD? Where is it located?

2006-03-11T15:38:00.000Z	redguy	palc1	you might want to read about FAI - Fully Autoamted Install
2006-03-11T15:38:00.000Z	palc1	redguy	where can I read about it?
2006-03-11T15:39:00.000Z	palc1	redguy	you see I want to create a small repo of the downloaded files and to put it as a default in the list on the iso CD image for my neighbours use

2006-03-11T15:40:00.000Z	redguy	palc1	though I'm not sure you can prepare install CD's with FAI
2006-03-11T15:41:00.000Z	palc1	redguy	I thought it might be possible to just edit a file within a deb package. Is it?
2006-03-11T15:45:00.000Z	palc1	redguy	d'you know which package contains the repo list?
2006-03-11T15:47:00.000Z	redguy	palc1	AFAIK sources.list is generated during the install, don't know which package does it actually, sorry
2006-03-11T15:47:00.000Z	palc1	redguy	sorry for asking these many may be silly qs, how can I extract a deb file so to edit and rebuild it afterwards ?
2006-03-11T15:49:00.000Z	redguy	palc1	hrmm, never done it myself. Maybe crimsun could help you on that
