2007-03-29T06:43:00.000Z	whta		well is it normal for it to take a LONG TIME restarting X?
2007-03-29T06:44:00.000Z	jrib	whta	long time =?
2007-03-29T06:44:00.000Z	whta	jrib	long time = several minutes, sometimes to the point where it needs to launch an "alternate greeter program"
2007-03-29T06:44:00.000Z	jrib	whta	no, that's not normal.  How are you attempting to restart X?
2007-03-29T06:45:00.000Z	whta	jrib	ctrl alt backspace
2007-03-29T06:45:00.000Z	jrib	whta	does it happen with a fresh new user?
2007-03-29T06:46:00.000Z	whta	jrib	i haven't tried that..
2007-03-29T06:46:00.000Z	jrib	whta	trying would help you troubleshoot
2007-03-29T06:46:00.000Z	whta	jrib	ok, i'll do that
2007-03-29T06:48:00.000Z	jrib	whta	did it always do this?
2007-03-29T06:48:00.000Z	whta	jrib	i believe so.
2007-03-29T06:51:00.000Z	jrib	whta	well I was going to suggest checking ~/.xsession-errors  but if it happens when you are at gdm I suppose there won't be anything useful there.  Any ideas on which logs to check?
2007-03-29T06:53:00.000Z	whta	jrib	i'm a massive noob still with linux so i wouldn't know what logs
2007-03-29T06:59:00.000Z	jrib	whta	well... since I'm not sure, why not pastebin the following: ~/.xsession-errors /var/log/messages and /var/log/syslog
2007-03-29T06:59:00.000Z	jrib	whta	what vid card do you have?
2007-03-29T07:00:00.000Z	jrib	whta	looks related: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/38915

2007-09-20T07:24:00.000Z	whta	jrib	wasn't gnome 2.20 just released?
2007-09-20T07:25:00.000Z	jrib	whta	ah, then no, it will not be in feisty repos ever.  It will be in the next release of ubuntu 7.10 due in october and you can upgrade to that then
2008-09-21T02:15:00.000Z	jrib	whta	are you 'cd'ed into the directory somewhere?
