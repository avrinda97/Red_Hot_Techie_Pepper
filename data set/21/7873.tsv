2006-06-27T15:13:00.000Z	farous_out	sss	did you solve your problem
2006-06-27T15:17:00.000Z	farous_out	sss	in a terminal type, sudo echo "deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu dapper universe" >> /etc/apt/sources.list && sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude install r-base
2006-06-27T15:19:00.000Z	farous_out	sss	how is it going
2006-06-27T15:20:00.000Z	farous_out	sss	you do not need to delete it the command i sent just append the multiverse line to your sources.list file
2006-06-27T15:20:00.000Z	farous_out	sss	you can check it it is the last line in the file
2006-06-27T15:23:00.000Z	farous_out	sss	i presume everything is ok
2006-06-27T15:25:00.000Z	farous_out	sss	cool
2006-06-27T15:25:00.000Z	farous_out	sss	now you need to do some reading to understand linux and ubuntu visit help.ubuntu.com and get familiar with it
2006-06-27T15:28:00.000Z	farous_out	sss	you are using a mirror what i gave to you is the main. normally it is faster to use a mirror
2006-06-27T15:30:00.000Z	farous_out	sss	you can edit or comment simultaneous sources.
2006-06-27T15:30:00.000Z	farous_out	sss	generally it won't cause probs if mirrors are sync
2006-06-27T15:32:00.000Z	farous_out	sss	most probably you did not enable universe in your sourcelist.
2006-06-27T15:33:00.000Z	farous_out	sss	generate a new source list and replace yours
2006-06-27T15:33:00.000Z	farous_out	sss	read ubotu pm
2006-06-27T15:39:00.000Z	farous_out	sss	?
2006-06-27T15:40:00.000Z	farous_out	sss	check the end of the file
