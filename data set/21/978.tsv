2011-08-14T17:03:00.000Z	zabomber		can i script the addition of users to the sudoers ?
2011-08-14T17:03:00.000Z	dr_willis	zabomber	 you can script most anything you want.. :) if you got the skill.
2011-08-14T17:04:00.000Z	zabomber	dr_willis	http://pastebin.com/G4VL0vkC i want to add the ability to option in for a user to be added to sudoers
2011-08-14T17:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	zabomber	  to what end? if you want a user to have full sudo rights, you add them to the proper group normally
2011-08-14T17:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	zabomber	  somthing like that. I rarely have to mess with it.. as for your script.. Im not sure that using sudo IN a script.. always works properly.
2011-11-26T11:43:00.000Z	dr_willis	zabomber	 and it does what exactly? runs an X app? just cli stuff?
2011-11-26T11:44:00.000Z	dr_willis	zabomber	 you can use the su, and sudo commands to swtich to a differnt user if you have the proper permissions
2011-11-26T11:46:00.000Z	dr_willis	zabomber	 he may need to know the password for the other account
2011-11-26T11:46:00.000Z	dr_willis	zabomber	 try it and see if it works.
2012-03-15T14:57:00.000Z	dr_willis	zabomber	 for the currect x session or yiu just need a desktoo. like vnc does
2012-03-15T14:58:00.000Z	zabomber	dr_willis	so how do i enable vnc on the ubuntu box via ssh? im helping a friend?
2012-03-15T14:59:00.000Z	dr_willis	zabomber	 if you are doing remote help. yiu may want to use teamviewer
2012-03-15T14:59:00.000Z	zabomber	dr_willis	ok. thanks
2012-03-15T15:00:00.000Z	zabomber	dr_willis	i know. but vnc was my first option... at the box, they can enable it, i just wanted to know if there was a quick command to enable "remote desktop sharing" on ubuntu so that i could access it remotly...
2012-03-15T15:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	zabomber	 thats maiinly for local lan access
2012-03-15T15:02:00.000Z	zabomber	dr_willis	i know. but i am vpn'ed in... and its pretty fast. teamviewer is not the most stable on ubuntu especially when connecting from a newer client
2012-03-15T15:02:00.000Z	dr_willis	zabomber	gnomes vino is there. but teamviewer is mist likely a better tool
2012-03-15T15:02:00.000Z	dr_willis	zabomber	you cant enable vino. he would have to.
2012-03-15T15:02:00.000Z	zabomber	dr_willis	thanks so much! just came across vino on google
