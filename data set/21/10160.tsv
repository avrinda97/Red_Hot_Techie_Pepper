2005-05-10T11:06:00.000Z	ivoks	fsapo	lol and thoose aren't ATIs? :)
2005-05-10T11:07:00.000Z	fsapo	ivoks	yes they are.. but to install the rpm ones you need to compile the kernel module
2005-05-10T11:09:00.000Z	fsapo	ivoks	do you have the kernel headers package installed?
2005-05-10T11:09:00.000Z	ivoks	fsapo	me? nope...
2005-05-10T11:09:00.000Z	fsapo	ivoks	so that's the problem... just install the headers for your current kernel
2005-05-10T11:10:00.000Z	ivoks	fsapo	?
2005-05-10T11:10:00.000Z	ivoks	fsapo	i don't have problems :)
2005-05-10T11:11:00.000Z	fsapo	ivoks	the kernel headers package will give you the kernel source
2005-05-10T11:11:00.000Z	ivoks	fsapo	why would i need them? :)
2005-05-10T11:11:00.000Z	ivoks	fsapo	and u are wrong, kernel headers are just headers, not source
2005-05-10T11:12:00.000Z	fsapo	ivoks	arent you the one who was asking about the C headers file for your kernel?
2005-05-10T11:12:00.000Z	ivoks	fsapo	nope :)
