2008-02-08T15:33:00.000Z	up_the_irons		hey guys
2008-02-08T15:34:00.000Z	up_the_irons		quick question: dpkg -C shows there's one unconfigured package.  I want to say "just forget about it", and have it delete the package, so apt-get will work again
2008-02-08T15:34:00.000Z	up_the_irons		how do i do that?
2008-02-08T15:35:00.000Z	nemilar	up_the_irons	have you tried configuring it with dpkg --configure -a ?
2008-02-08T15:36:00.000Z	up_the_irons	nemilar	yes, but there's dependency problems
2008-02-08T15:37:00.000Z	nemilar	up_the_irons	do you have the .deb file ?
2008-02-08T15:37:00.000Z	up_the_irons	nemilar	it doesn't seem to, easily, let me say "ok, i have dependency problems, so forget about it, don't install the package and forget you tried"
2008-02-08T15:37:00.000Z	up_the_irons	nemilar	yes i have the .deb
2008-02-08T15:37:00.000Z	nemilar	up_the_irons	give gdebi a try
2008-02-08T15:37:00.000Z	nemilar	up_the_irons	gdebi-gtk file.deb
2008-02-08T15:37:00.000Z	up_the_irons	nemilar	oh i don't have gtk or anything installed, it's a server
2008-02-08T15:38:00.000Z	nemilar	up_the_irons	oh true
2008-02-08T15:38:00.000Z	nemilar	up_the_irons	it won't let you dpkg -r  ?
2008-02-08T15:38:00.000Z	up_the_irons	nemilar	what i've done until now is remove the package with --force-depends, and then reinstall the "good" version
2008-02-08T15:39:00.000Z	up_the_irons	nemilar	i guess i'll just have to keep doing that
2008-02-08T15:39:00.000Z	nemilar	up_the_irons	there's definitely a solution, SOSTM would be able to help you
2008-02-08T15:39:00.000Z	up_the_irons	nemilar	but yeah, dpkg -r complains too
2008-02-08T15:40:00.000Z	up_the_irons	nemilar	sostm?
2008-02-08T15:40:00.000Z	nemilar	up_the_irons	someone smarter than me
2008-02-08T15:40:00.000Z	up_the_irons	nemilar	haha
2008-02-08T15:40:00.000Z	up_the_irons	nemilar	ok :)
