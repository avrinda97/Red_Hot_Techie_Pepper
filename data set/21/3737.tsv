2008-10-11T11:16:00.000Z	Leonheart		or extarct it
2008-10-11T11:16:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Leonheart	 .bin is not 'suse' exclusive..
2008-10-11T11:17:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Leonheart	 it may or may not work.. what exactly are you trying to install?
2008-10-11T11:19:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Leonheart	 theres a lot of other 'basics' also out. not in the repos.. you just uncompress to a directory and use.
2008-10-11T11:19:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Leonheart	 .binjust means its a 'self insalling excutable' so run the thing and see if it blows up. :)
2008-10-11T11:20:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Leonheart	 chmod +x whatever.bin    ./whatever.bin
2008-10-11T11:23:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Leonheart	 where did this .bin come from?
2008-10-11T11:24:00.000Z	Leonheart	Dr_willis_	from KBASIC official site http://kbasic.com
2008-10-11T11:28:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Leonheart	  ./installer_kbasic_professional_linux.bin
2008-10-11T11:30:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Leonheart	  ./installer_kbasic_professional_linux.bin      - worked and installed here.. I need to install some xtraa files to get the app to actually run it seems.
2008-10-11T11:31:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Leonheart	 they list on the web site whats needed..    but im not going to try too hard to get it goind.. why use basic when theres better languages out
2008-10-11T11:33:00.000Z	Leonheart	Dr_willis_	I just want to try out. there is not so annying if I can't get it installed. I have better compiler for anything :)
2008-10-11T11:33:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Leonheart	 looks like it dont like the qtwebkit version in ubuntu.. so im giving up on that kbasic
2008-10-11T11:33:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Leonheart	 it installed.. it just wont run. :)
2008-10-11T11:34:00.000Z	Leonheart	Dr_willis_	Thanks Dr,
2008-10-11T11:34:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Leonheart	 leave a note on the kbasic forums.
2008-10-11T11:35:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Leonheart	 it might need the kde4 libs
