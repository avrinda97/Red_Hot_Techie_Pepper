2010-05-01T13:42:00.000Z	arinda		hey all. can we update repos manually?
2010-05-01T13:42:00.000Z	maco	arinda	sudo apt-get update
2010-05-01T13:42:00.000Z	arinda	maco	i mean not without internet connection?
2010-05-01T13:43:00.000Z	maco	arinda	dont think so. what use would it be to know where to fetch files you cant fetch?
2010-05-01T13:52:00.000Z	maco	arinda	ubuntu comes with gtk+ libraries installed since it's gnome based
2010-05-01T13:53:00.000Z	arinda	maco	so, can i use it directly to produce some programs? or i need another programs?
2010-05-01T14:08:00.000Z	maco	arinda	glade exists for laying out graphical elements
2010-05-01T14:08:00.000Z	maco	arinda	other than that... whatever you normally use for writing C or Python (depending which you're intending to use)
2010-05-01T14:10:00.000Z	arinda	maco	i use c or basic if there?
2010-05-01T14:10:00.000Z	maco	arinda	gtk is usually either C or Python. i dont know of anything that runs with basic...
2010-05-01T14:10:00.000Z	maco	arinda	oh there's ruby bindngs for gtk too. they're crappy and crash a lot though
2010-05-01T14:11:00.000Z	arinda	maco	ok, so which IDE for it?
2010-05-01T14:11:00.000Z	maco	arinda	um i just use a text editor. i use vim.  i guess you could use eclipse if you want a big IDE with buttons and things... though Kate is a nice syntax-highlighting graphical text editor
2010-05-01T14:14:00.000Z	arinda	maco	ok. thanks. do you know good tutor about that? gtk+ programming through text editor?
2010-05-01T14:14:00.000Z	maco	arinda	read the GTK API docs?
2010-05-01T14:14:00.000Z	maco	arinda	its the same as you do any C programming. open a file...start typing, save it with a .c name, and then compile it
2010-05-01T14:15:00.000Z	arinda	maco	i don't have. i think i need some tutor how to compile it?
2010-05-01T14:16:00.000Z	maco	arinda	use gcc
2010-05-01T14:16:00.000Z	maco	arinda	gcc -o myexecutablename myprogramfile.c
2010-05-01T14:16:00.000Z	arinda	maco	oh.... ok. thanks i see.
2010-05-01T14:16:00.000Z	maco	arinda	or if you want it to give you all available warnings... gcc -Wall -o myexecutablename myprogramfile.c
