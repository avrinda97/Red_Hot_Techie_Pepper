2006-12-30T10:24:00.000Z	brandon_		how can I install wine?
2006-12-30T10:25:00.000Z	dubious9	brandon_	sudo apt-get install wine
2006-12-30T10:26:00.000Z	dubious9	brandon_	what are you trying to run?
2006-12-30T10:28:00.000Z	dubious9	brandon_	I'm not sure that wine supports that.  But I'm pretty sure cedega does.  http://www.transgaming.com
2006-12-30T10:28:00.000Z	dubious9	brandon_	cedega isn't free, but you can get the binary for 5 bucks last I checked.
2006-12-30T10:29:00.000Z	dubious9	brandon_	wine is good for stuff that isn't 3d intensive.  if you want to get it working, I'd suggest cedega
2006-12-30T10:35:00.000Z	dubious9	brandon_	oooh, you're running the 64 bit version?
2006-12-30T10:36:00.000Z	dubious9	brandon_	sorry I don't have much expirience with that.  I've got a 64 bit chip myself, and I'm running the 32 bit version.  It seems to work out better that way for me.
2006-12-30T10:37:00.000Z	dubious9	brandon_	why?
2006-12-30T10:38:00.000Z	dubious9	brandon_	hehe, yeah but I think right now it's a pipe dream.  There's no real compelling reason to run the 64 bit AFAIK.  and lot's of drawbacks
2006-12-30T10:39:00.000Z	dubious9	brandon_	well, driver incompatabilies for one.  Most software is still very much 32bit.  There are a bunch of bugs on the 64 side
2006-12-30T10:40:00.000Z	dubious9	brandon_	yeah, exactly that.  I can't say for sure it's the cause but it's a leading contender.
2006-12-30T10:41:00.000Z	dubious9	brandon_	long story short, if it's a server a install the 64 bit.  But if it's a multimedia workstation (aka home computer) stick with the 32.
2006-12-30T10:42:00.000Z	dubious9	brandon_	you could always just try the 32 bit live cd and see if the audio pops still happen
2006-12-30T10:44:00.000Z	dubious9	brandon_	I'm just speaking from personal experience.  Right now, from what I've seen, the 32 bit is easier to work with.  You shouldn't feel "cheated" because you're running a 32 bit OS
2006-12-30T10:51:00.000Z	dubious9	brandon_	well I'm sorry I couldn't help ya much.  I don't have any expirience with the 64 bit.
2006-12-30T10:52:00.000Z	dubious9	brandon_	well I know reinstalling is a pain, but I really do recomend the 32 bit version, especially for multimedia and 3d stuff
2006-12-30T10:54:00.000Z	brandon_	dubious9	?
2006-12-30T10:54:00.000Z	dubious9	brandon_	You want to know what now?
2006-12-30T10:55:00.000Z	dubious9	brandon_	well the nvidia drivers are tuned for the 32 bit world for one.  If you plan on playing games that is.
2006-12-30T10:58:00.000Z	dubious9	brandon_	those should be ok, but you've got to realize that 64bit is a second hand citizen in the multimedia market.  Drivers are particularly finicky
