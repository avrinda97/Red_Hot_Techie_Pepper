2010-01-01T01:09:00.000Z	usr13	virustb	You will need a wireless router, (unless your wifi device has AP mode, which is unlikely).
2010-01-01T01:10:00.000Z	virustb	usr13	 and how do i find out if i have an AP mode?
2010-01-01T01:11:00.000Z	usr13	virustb	You just have to look up the specks on it.
2010-01-01T01:11:00.000Z	virustb	usr13	 is there a command for that
2010-01-01T01:12:00.000Z	usr13	virustb	 Now there is the possibility that  you can use  ad hoc mode.
2010-01-01T01:12:00.000Z	virustb	usr13	 how do i enable adhoc?
2010-01-01T01:16:00.000Z	usr13	virustb	I think it's something like:  iwconfig eth0 ap any   or  iwconfig eth0 ad-hoc  etc.
2010-01-01T01:21:00.000Z	usr13	virustb	iwpriv
2010-01-01T01:22:00.000Z	virustb	usr13	 iwpriv ?
2010-01-01T01:23:00.000Z	usr13	virustb	Iwpriv is the companion tool  to  iwconfig, deals with parameters and settings
2010-01-01T01:24:00.000Z	usr13	virustb	See:  man iwconfig ; man iwpriv
2010-01-01T01:27:00.000Z	virustb	usr13	 ok well i tried http://bigbrovar.wordpress.com/2009/01/17/share-you-internet-wirelessly-on-ubuntu/ that patdk-wk  metioned,  my other laptop see's the wif but doesnt connect to the net :S
2010-01-01T01:29:00.000Z	usr13	virustb	if you can get them to connect to each  other, you will be able to share the network connection, otherwise not.
2010-01-01T01:34:00.000Z	virustb	usr13	 still no luck with !firestart :(
