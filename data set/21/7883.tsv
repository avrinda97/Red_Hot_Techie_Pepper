2006-07-30T16:48:00.000Z	jmichaelx	Jack_Sparrow	i am not trolling, i have just had a lot of bad luck  the last 2 weeks.... so stuff it
2006-07-30T16:49:00.000Z	jmichaelx	Jack_Sparrow	i do not appreciate you saying i was trolling either
2006-07-30T16:50:00.000Z	jmichaelx	Jack_Sparrow	i never said i didnt like linux, i am frustrated. please do not talk to me... i have been working on this broadcom card for a week, and i am just messing things up more
2006-07-30T16:53:00.000Z	jmichaelx	Jack_Sparrow	i have been given no link to any fix
2006-09-04T10:14:00.000Z	jmichaelx	Jack_Sparrow	may i send you a private message?
2006-09-04T10:57:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jmichaelx	It can be done.. yes
2006-09-04T10:58:00.000Z	jmichaelx	Jack_Sparrow	would you know of any doc that would cover such a thing?
2006-09-04T10:58:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jmichaelx	http://users.bigpond.net.au/hermanzone/SuperGrubDiskPage.html   may come in handy
2006-09-04T11:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jmichaelx	THe super grub reapir works easier when adding a second drive. etc..
2006-09-04T11:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jmichaelx	You can always use windows to come back and ask questions
2006-09-04T11:00:00.000Z	jmichaelx	Jack_Sparrow	i can see how that would probably be the case. i will probably give that a try
2006-09-04T11:01:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jmichaelx	It is a bootable cd that checks all drives and combinations of os's and trys to set them up for you
2006-09-04T11:01:00.000Z	jmichaelx	Jack_Sparrow	i think that is exactly what i need
2006-09-04T11:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jmichaelx	Kinda thought so..
2006-09-04T11:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jmichaelx	and thanks for our discussion earlier
2006-09-04T11:03:00.000Z	jmichaelx	Jack_Sparrow	more than welcome
