2005-07-21T05:32:00.000Z	mactiny		does anyone here know what is currently the best gfx card for laptops
2005-07-21T05:32:00.000Z	mactiny		speed wize
2005-07-21T05:33:00.000Z	mactiny		what 3dmark scores do you get roughly
2005-07-21T05:33:00.000Z	tanki	mactiny	If you can afford it, try to find a laptop that allows interchanging of gfx cards. More and more manufacter's are doing this and it's a great idea if you get a laptop as a desktop replacement (ala. gaming). DELL XPS is one I know of that does this.
2005-07-21T05:33:00.000Z	mactiny		areu able to play most of the current games
2005-07-21T05:34:00.000Z	mactiny		oh ok, thanks
2005-07-21T05:34:00.000Z	mactiny		good to know
2005-07-21T05:34:00.000Z	mactiny		ive been away from the gaming scene for awhile, i must say, im quite amazed that the gfx are that fast
2005-07-21T05:35:00.000Z	mactiny		how would you compare mobile gfx to desktop
2005-07-21T05:35:00.000Z	mactiny		at the mo
2005-07-21T05:36:00.000Z	tanki	mactiny	they've come a long way but in general the desktop beats them out because traditionally you're stuck with the gfx card you have in your laptop for the life of the laptop
2005-07-21T05:36:00.000Z	mactiny		i get that
2005-07-21T05:36:00.000Z	mactiny		im thinking of getting a new laptop, ill have a look at the dell xps
2005-07-21T05:37:00.000Z	tanki		my laptop was able to play most games on the market at a great fps but now i don't dare try to play battlfield 2 on it for example
2005-07-21T05:37:00.000Z	tanki		and i can't really do anything about that
2005-07-21T05:37:00.000Z	mactiny		what laptop you got
2005-07-21T05:37:00.000Z	mactiny		tanki
2005-07-21T05:39:00.000Z	tanki	mactiny	just remember the two things you can't replace on a laptop is the lcd and the keyboard so make sure whichever laptop you choose, you like both those components
2005-07-21T05:40:00.000Z	tanki		so it doesn't matter if your laptop can power a rocket shuttle, if the keyboard doesn't feel right, then your experience with it will suck
2005-07-21T05:41:00.000Z	tanki		in that case you might as well just build a pc
2005-07-21T05:41:00.000Z	mactiny	tanki	..thanks, ill keep that in mind
