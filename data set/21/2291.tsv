2009-12-20T02:13:00.000Z	gdiz		hey I am trying to set up a media server on an ubuntu box.  I want to control it remotely from another computer.  I have located the vnc server and all that, but what I want to do is control the computer without it sending an image of the monitor back because it takes up too much CPU
2009-12-20T02:14:00.000Z	ardnew	gdiz	you can use ssh
2009-12-20T02:15:00.000Z	ardnew	gdiz	you can also look into X11 forwarding over ssh if you absolutely need a GUI displayed locally for an application running on the remote server
2009-12-20T02:16:00.000Z	gdiz	ardnew	yeah I'm messing with hulu so I need the gui
2009-12-20T02:16:00.000Z	gdiz	ardnew	how do you do the X11 forwarding in that way?
2009-12-20T02:16:00.000Z	ardnew	gdiz	enable X11 forwarding in the remove server's sshd config file and restart
2009-12-20T02:17:00.000Z	ardnew	gdiz	then connect to the remote server using ssh -X
2009-12-20T02:17:00.000Z	ardnew	gdiz	(this is assuming bboth machines are running X11)
2009-12-20T02:17:00.000Z	gdiz	ardnew	I am a bit of a newbie.  where is the sshd and what do you need to put in it
2009-12-20T02:18:00.000Z	ardnew	gdiz	but I dont understand why are you trying to view hulu streams from a remote machine on your local machine
2009-12-20T02:18:00.000Z	gdiz	ardnew	my ubuntu box is hooked up to my TV
2009-12-20T02:19:00.000Z	ardnew	gdiz	try logging into the remote machine via ssh, then launching your web browser with the hulu URL as an argument
2009-12-20T02:19:00.000Z	gdiz	ardnew	I don't need to see the stream on my client computer, but the ubuntu box needs to show it
2009-12-20T02:20:00.000Z	ardnew	gdiz	maybe the software "synergy" is all you need for what you're wanting
2009-12-20T02:21:00.000Z	ardnew	gdiz	otherwise, just control the ubuntu machine via ssh like I suggested
2009-12-20T02:23:00.000Z	gdiz	ardnew	what exactly does synergy do?
2009-12-20T02:23:00.000Z	ardnew	gdiz	you can use your client workstation's mouse and keyboard on the remote ubuntu machine like it was just a separate display with its own operating system
2009-12-20T02:23:00.000Z	ardnew	gdiz	you can drag your mouse over the ubuntu display and control it from your local computer
2009-12-20T02:24:00.000Z	gdiz		ardnew...aah...that should work
2009-12-20T02:24:00.000Z	gdiz		I'll play around with it.
2009-12-20T02:25:00.000Z	gdiz	ardnew	thanks a lot
