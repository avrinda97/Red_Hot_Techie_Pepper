2010-07-30T22:48:00.000Z	Starky		Does anyone have any idea what's wrong?
2010-07-30T22:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Starky	grab a wired connection and get updated
2010-07-30T22:49:00.000Z	Starky	ActionParsnip	Update what? I'm on a wired connection right now
2010-07-30T22:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Starky	the whole system
2010-07-30T22:50:00.000Z	Starky	ActionParsnip	How?
2010-07-30T22:50:00.000Z	Starky	ActionParsnip	I'm on 9.10, is that not the latest version? I just upgraded to it like 2 minutes ago.
2010-07-30T22:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Starky	run: sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2010-07-30T22:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Starky	thats fine, 9.10 is supported waaay into next year
2010-07-30T22:53:00.000Z	Starky	ActionParsnip	I ran those commands, they didn't affect my wireless-connecting abilities in the slightest.
2010-07-30T22:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Starky	but did you get a lot of updates?
2010-07-30T22:54:00.000Z	Starky	ActionParsnip	"0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded."
2010-07-30T22:55:00.000Z	Starky	ActionParsnip	I got the above for both commands
2010-07-30T22:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Starky	can you give the output of:  sudo lshw -C network; sudo iwlist scan | head -n 20   thanks (use http://pastie.org)
2010-07-30T22:58:00.000Z	Starky	ActionParsnip	bash: syntax error near unexpected token `('
2010-07-30T23:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Starky	don't copy "thanks (use http://pastie.org)"  thats my pleasantry, thats why I left the big space
2010-07-30T23:03:00.000Z	Starky	ActionParsnip	Why would I use a pastebin for one line?
2010-07-30T23:08:00.000Z	Starky	ActionParsnip	I apparently accidentally put in a parenthesis when I copypasted your command, here is the new output: http://pastie.org/1067439
2010-07-30T23:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Starky	it's not, its a LOT of lines and will look like this: http://pastie.org/1067440
2010-07-30T23:09:00.000Z	Starky	ActionParsnip	<Starky> I apparently accidentally put in a parenthesis when I copypasted your command, here is the new output: http://pastie.org/1067439
2010-07-30T23:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Starky	tru: sudo apt-get install b43-fwcutter bcmwl-kernel-source      then run the hardware driver app and install the driver
2010-07-30T23:13:00.000Z	Starky	ActionParsnip	Can't, the wired connection is borrowed
