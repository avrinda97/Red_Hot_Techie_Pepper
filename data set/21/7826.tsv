2006-07-09T15:09:00.000Z	euclid_888		Hi! I'm a new Ubuntu user. Can I get help installing SSH to mount remote folders locally?
2006-07-09T15:10:00.000Z	ompaul	euclid_888	when you say remote same network?
2006-07-09T15:10:00.000Z	euclid_888	ompaul	nope, a remote SSH server across the internet. I read that I could type "sudo apt-get install sshfs", but Ubuntu can't find the package.
2006-07-09T15:11:00.000Z	ompaul	euclid_888	sudo apt-get install openssh-server
2006-07-09T15:11:00.000Z	euclid_888	ompaul	I have the SSH server install that is the openssh one. Does it have what I need?
2006-07-09T15:12:00.000Z	ompaul	euclid_888	I never saw what you are looking at until now
2006-07-09T15:13:00.000Z	ompaul	euclid_888	let me find something
2006-07-09T15:13:00.000Z	euclid_888	ompaul	okay thanks. I use SSH all the time, but have never mounted remote drives locally.
2006-07-09T15:13:00.000Z	ompaul	euclid_888	you need to have the universe repos enabled
2006-07-09T15:14:00.000Z	ompaul	euclid_888	read the message from the bot ubotu please
