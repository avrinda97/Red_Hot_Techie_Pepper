2011-08-19T19:41:00.000Z	Morphies		Afternoon all, Newbie looking for a bit of help. Installation alongside windows 7, bootloader install failed
2011-08-19T19:41:00.000Z	ikonia	Morphies	define failed
2011-08-19T19:42:00.000Z	Morphies		Sorry, an error occured window on instalation
2011-08-19T19:42:00.000Z	ikonia		installation of what
2011-08-19T19:42:00.000Z	ikonia	Morphies	please try to be specific
2011-08-19T19:43:00.000Z	Morphies		I have a window open now, the window title is Bootloader install failed. There are 3 options: Install to a different device, continue without a bootloader and cancel the installation
2011-08-19T19:44:00.000Z	ikonia	Morphies	where did it try to install to
2011-08-19T19:45:00.000Z	Morphies		I've told it to install to /dev/sdb on my 500gb main drive, i;ve disconnected my other internal drives but a 6tb esata raid drive is still connected
2011-08-19T19:46:00.000Z	ikonia	Morphies	it's more likley that it will be sda then if you only have 1 driver installed
2011-08-19T19:46:00.000Z	ikonia	Morphies	once you put the second drive back in, it will change to sdb,
2011-08-19T19:46:00.000Z	ikonia	Morphies	this is one of the reasons you shouldn't disconnect drives while you are trying to install
2011-08-19T19:46:00.000Z	Morphies		no, sta is coming up as the 6tb external esata
2011-08-19T19:46:00.000Z	ikonia	Morphies	intteresting, then you should be fine to sdb
2011-08-19T19:47:00.000Z	Morphies		well i tried installing with the drives connected and couldn't select the 500gb OS drive to create the partition on
2011-08-19T19:47:00.000Z	Morphies		it wanted touse one of the 1.5tb data drives
2011-08-19T19:47:00.000Z	Morphies		to use*
2011-08-19T19:47:00.000Z	ikonia	Morphies	that suggests there is a more deep issue
2011-08-19T19:48:00.000Z	Morphies		i;ve tried selecting all of the different locations to install, none of them do anything, as in nothing happens. So I selected continue without a bootloader and stillnothing happens,the window juststays
2011-08-19T19:49:00.000Z	ikonia	Morphies	the two issues you've described suggest there is a deeper issue with your disk system and the installer
2011-08-19T19:50:00.000Z	Morphies	ikonia	Should I try installing again with only the main drive connected? or is there something else I should try? Or should I leave it alone altogether?
2011-08-19T19:50:00.000Z	ikonia	Morphies	truthfully I don't know without understanding the issue more,
