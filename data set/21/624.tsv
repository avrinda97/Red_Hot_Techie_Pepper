2011-08-26T18:32:00.000Z	beef2011		wifi randomly disconnecting in 11.04 wth rt3090 card (blacklisted drivers) here is the sys log http://paste.ubuntu.com/675271/
2011-08-26T18:33:00.000Z	makara	beef2011	open a terminal, type dmesg | pastebinit<enter>
2011-08-26T18:34:00.000Z	beef2011	makara	what will that do?
2011-08-26T18:42:00.000Z	makara	beef2011	what have you tried? you done any research? is this first time you're seeing this? did you change something?
2011-08-26T18:43:00.000Z	makara	beef2011	can you connect without wicd?
2011-08-26T18:44:00.000Z	beef2011	makara	I've tried blacklisting a couple more suggested drivers but it doesn't help, this is indeed the first time I'm seeing this and I haven't changed anything at all apart from adding dkms + a package for the card and blacklisting drivers
2011-08-26T18:45:00.000Z	beef2011	makara	I've read about wicd but how will it help?
2011-08-26T18:49:00.000Z	makara	beef2011	make you remember what you blacklisted. why were you blacklisting stuff?
2011-08-26T18:49:00.000Z	beef2011	makara	I was blacklisting stuff because there are conflicting drivers for my wireless card under ubuntu
2011-08-26T18:50:00.000Z	makara	beef2011	so it didn't work, then you blacklisted, now it works but intermittently
2011-08-26T18:51:00.000Z	makara	beef2011	what's the signal strength list? what's the refresh period on your WLAN set to?
2011-08-26T18:51:00.000Z	beef2011	makara	this is what I blacklisted and yes it wasn't working before blacklist and now it is but it conks out after a minute or so rt2800pci rt2800lib rt2x00usb rt2x00pci rt2x00lib rt2860sta
2011-08-26T18:52:00.000Z	beef2011	makara	signal strength when connected is full and I've no idea what the refresh rate is
2011-08-26T18:54:00.000Z	makara	beef2011	didn't happen after a kernel update perhaps? i wouldn't go wicd yet. its will help if there's a bug in network-manager (I think)
2011-08-26T18:55:00.000Z	beef2011	makara	no I haven't changed a thing since my wubi install, it can't update the kernel because of the wireless conking out
2011-08-26T18:55:00.000Z	beef2011	makara	when I say I haven't changed anything i mean nothing I haven't said
2011-08-26T18:57:00.000Z	makara	beef2011	you'd probably be best off going somewhere with an ethernet connection and updating everything. then see if that doesn't solve your problem
2011-08-26T18:57:00.000Z	beef2011	makara	hmm ok
2011-08-26T18:57:00.000Z	beef2011	makara	might as well just try Oneiric when it comes out if I'm gonna do that
2011-08-26T18:58:00.000Z	makara	beef2011	i'm still trying to get my wifi working even after updates, 11.04 and Oneric. Mine is AR9271
2011-08-26T18:59:00.000Z	makara	beef2011	wifi is not linux's strength. But if all else fails you can try linuxwireless.org, the #linux-wireless channel, and really get into things with iw and wap-supplicant
