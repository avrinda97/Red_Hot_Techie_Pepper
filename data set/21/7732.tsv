2009-03-30T05:29:00.000Z	manny		hi i need help. Im trying to install Vuze 4.2 on to Intrepid Ibex
2009-03-30T05:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	manny	vuze is alright, but how about ktorrent?  more light waight and very nice looking if it's the KDE4 version
2009-03-30T05:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	manny	which it will be if on 8.10 and probably if  on 8.04  and you run  sudo apt-get install ktorrent
2009-03-30T05:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	manny	ok as far as I know, you sitll need java installed for vuze
2009-03-30T05:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	manny	maybe it's still known as Azureus in the Ubuntu repo
2009-03-30T05:33:00.000Z	manny	sebsebseb	ok lets start with java then
2009-03-30T05:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	manny	you know how to install?
2009-03-30T05:34:00.000Z	manny	sebsebseb	java ive tried i hope i did it right
2009-03-30T05:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	manny	yeah the sun version
2009-03-30T05:35:00.000Z	manny	sebsebseb	can you help me install java
2009-03-30T05:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	manny	of course,  do you want just Java,  or  other things like  AVI suppourt  and MP3 and  Flash and so on
2009-03-30T05:37:00.000Z	manny	sebsebseb	java for now
2009-03-30T05:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	manny	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras is the easiest way to get the stuff I mentioned, but if you want just Java.   easiest way would be to go to a site  that has a java applet in Firefox such as http://www.jonstorm.com and click  on where the applet would go.  then  in  the graphical thing choose sun java
2009-03-30T05:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	manny	if you see the water on that site, you have  Sun java already installed, or you installed one of the other versions.  right clicking  will probably tell you
2009-03-30T05:39:00.000Z	manny	sebsebseb	oh i have that already it works just fine in my browser and such
2009-03-30T05:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	manny	check that it's the sun version
2009-03-30T05:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	manny	ok there you go then :)
2009-03-30T05:42:00.000Z	manny	sebsebseb	ok now for Vuze
2009-03-30T05:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	manny	see above
2009-03-30T05:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	manny	Azureues is vuze basically.  yeah  it got renamed to vuze
2009-03-30T05:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	manny	or get it from the vuze site
