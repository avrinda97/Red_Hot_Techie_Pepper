2008-02-19T20:04:00.000Z	Desert_Storm	white_eagle_	ATI Radeon 9550
2008-02-19T20:07:00.000Z	white_eagle_	Desert_Storm	from what I have learnt from the forums, if you have an old ATi card, you can get the desktop effects but no direct rendering sorry, you'll have to use AIGLX which is in development and will give you direct rendering, but no desktop effects (they're planning to include that in the next release)
2008-02-19T20:08:00.000Z	white_eagle_	Desert_Storm	you'll must uninstall the drivers
2008-02-19T20:08:00.000Z	white_eagle_	Desert_Storm	do you reallywant to do that?
2008-02-19T20:10:00.000Z	white_eagle_	Desert_Storm	you already have fglrx don't you?
2008-02-19T20:16:00.000Z	white_eagle_	Desert_Storm	does dir. rendering work now?
