2006-03-21T11:11:00.000Z	Mabus06		Somebody was trying to access the file sharing port of my windows computer, according to zonealarm. I am on ubuntu now, but if there is a possibility somebody is trying to maliciously affect my computer, what should I do to keep my computer safe?
2006-03-21T11:12:00.000Z	volmarias	Mabus06	if zone alarm reported it, you're fine.
2006-03-21T11:12:00.000Z	Mabus06	volmarias	but I'm on ubuntu now...
2006-03-21T11:12:00.000Z	volmarias	Mabus06	then you're doubly fine :)
2006-03-21T11:12:00.000Z	volmarias	Mabus06	as long as your system is patched and you're running a firewall, you're almost certainly ok against anything
2006-03-21T11:13:00.000Z	volmarias	Mabus06	unless you have the ports opened up for file sharing on your windows machine, you don't have anything to worry about
2006-03-21T11:13:00.000Z	Mabus06	volmarias	I don't have any firewall software, this is a fresh ubuntu install.
2006-03-21T11:13:00.000Z	volmarias	Mabus06	did you just nuke your windows install because someone sent you a few packets?
2006-03-21T11:13:00.000Z	Mabus06	volmarias	no, dual boot.
2006-03-21T11:14:00.000Z	volmarias	Mabus06	you're probably fine. It doesn't seem like the router is acting like a firewall, because zonealarm is reporting things. Either you have yourself set in the DMZ or you have those ports forwarded
2006-03-21T11:14:00.000Z	volmarias	Mabus06	piss anyone off lately? :)
2006-03-21T11:15:00.000Z	Mabus06	volmarias	no, but I did go to the #2600 channell on their network after reading their magazine. I don't think they're as keen on being whitehats as their magazine made me think.
2006-03-21T11:15:00.000Z	volmarias	Mabus06	did you mask your IP?
2006-03-21T11:16:00.000Z	Mabus06	volmarias	no...
2006-03-21T11:16:00.000Z	Mabus06	volmarias	actually I was running xchat for windows, got used to it form ubuntu
2006-03-21T11:17:00.000Z	Mabus06	volmarias	domain might not have been the right word... the first two octets were always the same
2006-03-21T11:17:00.000Z	volmarias	Mabus06	play dead?
2006-03-21T11:19:00.000Z	Mabus06	volmarias	you mean leave my computer off? Well yeah, I mean I could throw my box out the window and I could be sure it wouldn't be hacked, but that defeats the point.
2006-03-21T11:20:00.000Z	volmarias	Mabus06	I'd recommend that you modify the router so that it blocks packets from certain ranges
2006-03-21T11:20:00.000Z	Mabus06	volmarias	that's what I was trying, it wasn't out of the question that it was benevolent
2006-03-21T11:20:00.000Z	Mabus06	volmarias	but I couldn't tracert any of the ips they were using
