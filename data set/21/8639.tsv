2006-03-21T07:43:00.000Z	zF		Hi guys
2006-03-21T07:43:00.000Z	zF		I have a huge problem
2006-03-21T07:43:00.000Z	zF		I just installed ubuntu linux after using partition magic
2006-03-21T07:44:00.000Z	zF		and when I tried to use Windows after the install... It instantly blue screen'd of death'd before entering the OS
2006-03-21T07:44:00.000Z	zF		right before I installed ubuntu it said "Failed to start Operating System" or something along those lines
2006-03-21T07:44:00.000Z	mustard5	zF	was windows working just after using Partition Magic?
2006-03-21T07:44:00.000Z	zF	mustard5	no
2006-03-21T07:44:00.000Z	zF		that's when it said the "Failed to start OS"
2006-03-21T07:45:00.000Z	zF		but I just figured that was because I chose immediately
2006-03-21T07:46:00.000Z	mustard5	zF	so Partition Magic could have wrecked it first?
2006-03-21T07:47:00.000Z	zF	mustard5	I don't know... I thought it said that because I chose imidate linux install after the changes and needed to install Ubuntu first
2006-03-21T07:47:00.000Z	zF		then with Grub it'd work
2006-03-21T07:47:00.000Z	zF	mustard5	should I restart and look at the blue screen of death?
2006-03-21T07:47:00.000Z	mustard5	zF	someone did ask that..I wouldn't know how to interpret a BSOD message myself
2006-03-21T07:48:00.000Z	mustard5	zF	have you tried mounting the windows partition from linux?
2006-03-21T07:48:00.000Z	mustard5	zF	maybe you can rescue data from it?
2006-03-21T07:48:00.000Z	zF	mustard5	no
2006-03-21T07:48:00.000Z	zF		I don't care about rescueing data
2006-03-21T07:49:00.000Z	mustard5	zF	ah ok
2006-03-21T07:49:00.000Z	zF		I just need it to work. :(
2006-03-21T07:49:00.000Z	mustard5	zF	k
