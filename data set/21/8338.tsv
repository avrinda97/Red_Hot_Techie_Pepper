2008-05-05T06:55:00.000Z	astro76	Styles	what are you trying to do?
2008-05-05T06:55:00.000Z	Styles	astro76	I'm trying to move a file I Installed in the "invisable" C:\blah dir of wine.
2008-05-05T06:56:00.000Z	astro76	Styles	so go to home folder, view hidden files, then go in .wine
2008-05-05T06:57:00.000Z	Styles	astro76	I did. I went to View -> Show Hidden Files. Then I se more in /. I Don't see a .wine. I looked in home and all I see is the username of the account.
2008-05-05T06:57:00.000Z	astro76	Styles	your "home folder" is /home/username
