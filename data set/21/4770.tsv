2008-02-17T21:03:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Nitroray	   can your user sudo?
2008-02-17T21:05:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Nitroray	restricted-manager (just type restricted and tab will autocomplete)
2008-02-17T21:10:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Nitroray	you don't need to login as root, you just have to log in as an admin user (ie.  one who can sudo)
