2004-10-25T09:35:00.000Z	abstrato_general		morbid detail, xorg compiled myself. 
2004-10-25T09:35:00.000Z	abstrato_general		a whole system compiled from stage 1.
2004-10-25T09:36:00.000Z	abstrato_general		anyway, I'm addicted to Linux and am looking for something with better performance on old computers. Is Ubuntu for me?
2004-10-25T09:37:00.000Z	abstrato_general		I even tried the experimental kernels.
2004-10-25T09:37:00.000Z	abstrato_general		I even tried running with love-sources and ratpoison. I mean.
2004-10-25T09:37:00.000Z	abstrato_general		It takes a beating. 
2004-10-25T09:38:00.000Z	abstrato_general		ratpoison is the most minimal WM available, it's just a series of virtual desktops where windows are showed maximized
2004-10-25T09:39:00.000Z	abstrato_general		or when scrolling in any web browser.
2004-10-25T09:39:00.000Z	abstrato_general		dillo, for chrissake.
2004-10-25T09:39:00.000Z	abstrato_general		and YES, I experimented with prelinking too.
2004-10-25T09:39:00.000Z	LinuxJones	abstrato_general	what system specs do you have ?
2004-10-25T09:42:00.000Z	LinuxJones	abstrato_general	what system specs do you have on your machine ?
2004-10-25T09:43:00.000Z	abstrato_general	LinuxJones	I did say that thrice already :)
2004-10-25T09:43:00.000Z	LinuxJones	abstrato_general	sorry am watching a movie :D
2004-10-25T09:44:00.000Z	LinuxJones	abstrato_general	K6-|| 300 is total junk, what do you expect will happen when you run X ?
2004-10-25T09:45:00.000Z	abstrato_general	LinuxJones	it runs WinXP with all the GUI options on (including stuff not present in X like true alpha blending) very very well.
2004-10-25T09:45:00.000Z	LinuxJones	abstrato_general	my brother has the same system running Windows 98 and it does not run very well at all.
2004-10-25T09:46:00.000Z	abstrato_general	LinuxJones	maybe he should switch to a NT kernel-based Windows like 2K or XP.
2004-10-25T09:46:00.000Z	LinuxJones	abstrato_general	what are the minimum system specs for Windows XP ?
2004-10-25T09:47:00.000Z	LinuxJones	abstrato_general	Pentuim 500 and 128 megs of ram or something ?
2004-10-25T09:47:00.000Z	abstrato_general	LinuxJones	nah. It runs very well on this machine - much much inferior to a P500.
