2008-01-28T02:17:00.000Z	mc_	nickrud	if i do that it outputs nothing and typing ./test gives no such file or directory
2008-01-28T02:02:00.000Z	nickrud	mc_	type which <program> , make sure it's in your path
2008-01-28T02:04:00.000Z	nickrud	mc_	if you just added that path in that terminal, open another
2008-01-28T02:08:00.000Z	nickrud	mc_	in ~/.bashrc , add the line  PATH=/home/D/dsss/bin:$PATH
2008-01-28T02:09:00.000Z	nickrud	mc_	and it's possible that your program is looking for support files or something, and doesn't look in the executable's directory like it should
2008-01-28T02:15:00.000Z	mc_	nickrud	tried that interesting thing i made script, then chmod u+x it if i type test (name of script) it doesn't print anything but ./test does
2008-01-28T02:16:00.000Z	nickrud	mc_	try cd ~ , then run it. Make sure you're not in the same dir. But it seems that there is something wrong with your path yet
2008-01-28T02:17:00.000Z	mc_	nickrud	it doesn't say command not found though so i think the path part is working
2008-01-28T02:18:00.000Z	nickrud	mc_	yes I would agree ~ doesn't have test in it, that's why ./test didn't work (./ means current directory)
2008-01-28T02:18:00.000Z	nickrud	mc_	so make a short script that does cd to the right directory, then runs the program with ./ see if that works
2008-01-28T02:19:00.000Z	mc_	nickrud	so why even when i'm in the same folder would the script not output anything when run using 'test' but would when using './test' ???
2008-01-28T02:20:00.000Z	nickrud	mc_	off the top of my head? Not sure :)
2008-01-28T02:26:00.000Z	nickrud	mc_	that's a sure sign something is wrong with the path
2008-01-28T02:26:00.000Z	nickrud	mc_	don't do that :)
2008-01-28T02:27:00.000Z	nickrud	mc_	cd ~ , then try the foobar , as bascule pointed out the current directory is not on the path
2008-01-28T02:28:00.000Z	nickrud	mc_	paste the output of $PATH
2008-01-28T02:28:00.000Z	nickrud	mc_	echo $PATH that is
2008-01-28T02:29:00.000Z	nickrud	mc_	now  the output of pwd while you are in your home
2008-01-28T02:30:00.000Z	nickrud	mc_	and finally the output of pwd when you are in the dsss/bin dir
2008-01-28T02:30:00.000Z	nickrud	mc_	aha!   it should be /home/matthew/D/dss/bin  in your path
2008-01-28T02:31:00.000Z	nickrud	mc_	was assuming your home dir was named D
