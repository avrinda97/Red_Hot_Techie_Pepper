2010-03-18T11:26:00.000Z	maco	the_lorax	instead of renaming the top level with different letters, there's only 1 filesystem hierarchy in linux
2010-03-18T11:27:00.000Z	maco	the_lorax	your other drives get mounted under it in logical spots as to how they are going to be used
2010-03-18T11:27:00.000Z	maco	the_lorax	so if youre going to have one hold system files and one hold users' home folders, you put the one for home folders as /home
2010-03-18T11:27:00.000Z	maco	the_lorax	while the top level system is /
2010-03-18T11:27:00.000Z	maco	the_lorax	does that make sense?
2010-03-18T11:28:00.000Z	maco	the_lorax	you should get a highlight if someone's talking to you
2010-03-18T11:29:00.000Z	maco	the_lorax	well that depends on what program you use to irc, but sure
2010-03-18T11:30:00.000Z	maco	the_lorax	no
2010-03-18T11:30:00.000Z	maco	the_lorax	if you go to places -> computer does the sd show up anywhere?
2010-03-18T11:32:00.000Z	maco	the_lorax	go to applications -> accessories -> terminal
2010-03-18T11:32:00.000Z	maco	the_lorax	the weird gibberish eremite_ is saying to you are commands to type into the terminal
