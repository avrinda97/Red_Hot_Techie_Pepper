2006-04-27T16:58:00.000Z	jivah		warbo it says device in use
2006-04-27T05:00:00.000Z	jivah		warbo i think the sound card is not recognized
2006-04-27T05:02:00.000Z	jivah		warbo come on don't underestimate yourself, it is very bad for your ego lol
2006-04-27T05:02:00.000Z	Mathman	jivah	what's dmesg say about your sound card?  are modules loaded, that sorta thing?
2006-04-27T05:05:00.000Z	jivah	Mathman	i don't see any occurences concerning my sound card
2006-04-27T05:05:00.000Z	Mathman	jivah	well, loading the modules you'd need would be the first step.
2006-04-27T05:06:00.000Z	jivah	Mathman	how and where
2006-04-27T05:06:00.000Z	Mathman	jivah	that would depend on your sound card.  my system it would be something like "modprobe i8x0_sound"
2006-04-27T05:08:00.000Z	jivah	Mathman	i think it is integrated in my mother board
2006-04-27T05:08:00.000Z	Mathman	jivah	what is it?  lspci?  that would maybe give you some clues.
2006-04-27T05:09:00.000Z	jivah	Mathman	well i have a dell computer pentium 4, no idea about the sound card
2006-04-27T05:10:00.000Z	Mathman	jivah	that's why you'd run lspci.  there oughta be some sorta sound card set up utility though on ubuntu.  some one chime in here.
2006-04-27T05:11:00.000Z	jivah	Mathman	well got it Multimedia audio controller: Intel Corp. 82801FB/FBM/FR/FW/FRW (ICH6 Family) AC'97 Audio Controller (rev 03)
2006-04-27T05:11:00.000Z	Mathman	jivah	great.  so that's the exact same as mine.  you'd run that modprobe command I was telling you.  modprobe i8x0_sound or whatever.  course run lsmod first to see if it's already loaded or not.
2006-04-27T05:14:00.000Z	jivah	Mathman	FATAL: Module i8x0_sound not found.
2006-04-27T05:14:00.000Z	Mathman	jivah	well yeah, I said or whatever.  that's perhaps not the exact name.
2006-04-27T05:14:00.000Z	Mathman	jivah	crimsun hooked ya up though.
2006-04-27T05:15:00.000Z	Mathman	jivah	he means, what are you trying to do exactly.  what's your problem?  or she perhaps...
2006-04-27T05:29:00.000Z	Mathman	jivah	run lsmod and see if it lists snd_i8x0 or whatever.  then run dmesg and see what it says about it.
2006-04-27T05:35:00.000Z	Mathman	jivah	is esd or whatever running?  try and esd app
2006-04-27T05:39:00.000Z	Mathman	jivah	just mail me some wood now, from le bois de luthier or whatever.
