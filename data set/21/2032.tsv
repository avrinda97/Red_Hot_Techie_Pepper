2010-05-05T12:31:00.000Z	mikeliss		Any Apache experts around that can help me add a virtual host to my server? I already have seven, so adding one more seems like it would be easy, but the additional one kills all the others with no error messages I can find.
2010-05-05T12:32:00.000Z	FyreFoX	mikeliss	default vhost and the order of your others is generally what gets you
2010-05-05T12:33:00.000Z	mikeliss	FyreFoX	Hmm. I have them all in separate files, except for one file which has two.
2010-05-05T12:33:00.000Z	FyreFoX	mikeliss	if your using separate configs for each vhost, look at the order in which they will get loaded
2010-05-05T12:33:00.000Z	mikeliss	FyreFoX	How do you know what order they get loaded in?
2010-05-05T12:33:00.000Z	FyreFoX	mikeliss	ls -l
2010-05-05T12:33:00.000Z	mikeliss	FyreFoX	Ah. And how does that help diagnose?
2010-05-05T12:34:00.000Z	FyreFoX	mikeliss	is the top one your 'default' vhost?
2010-05-05T12:34:00.000Z	mikeliss	FyreFoX	Could be, sure. It worked in the past as the default? I guess...
2010-05-05T12:37:00.000Z	FyreFoX	mikeliss	your new vhost, where does it sit in the order of things?
2010-05-05T12:37:00.000Z	mikeliss	FyreFoX	kinda around the middle.
2010-05-05T12:37:00.000Z	FyreFoX	mikeliss	pastebin it?
2010-05-05T12:39:00.000Z	mikeliss	FyreFoX	http://pastie.org/946379
2010-05-05T12:40:00.000Z	FyreFoX	mikeliss	nothing blares out in that :P
2010-05-05T12:41:00.000Z	mikeliss	FyreFoX	yeah, indeed.
2010-05-05T12:42:00.000Z	mikeliss	FyreFoX	So, my next question is: how to debug.
2010-05-05T12:43:00.000Z	FyreFoX	mikeliss	start apache with -k
2010-05-05T12:44:00.000Z	mikeliss	FyreFoX	-k, eh? Intriguing.
2010-05-05T12:45:00.000Z	mikeliss	FyreFoX	Does that just run apache in the terminal so output is more obvious?
2010-05-05T12:45:00.000Z	FyreFoX	mikeliss	oh sorry, -X
2010-05-05T12:46:00.000Z	FyreFoX	mikeliss	-k is to start/stop it etc
