2008-08-21T06:20:00.000Z	ex-zelrikriando	emack	not sure it will fix it though
2008-08-21T06:23:00.000Z	ex-zelrikriando	emack	keep that package in mind though, you might wanna want to install it later

2008-08-21T06:30:00.000Z	ex-zelrikriando	emack	any progress yet?
2008-08-21T06:30:00.000Z	ex-zelrikriando	emack	so it's a more complicated issue...
2008-08-21T06:30:00.000Z	ex-zelrikriando	emack	did you see that link?
2008-08-21T06:32:00.000Z	ex-zelrikriando	emack	might be a problem with proprietary formats
2008-08-21T06:32:00.000Z	ex-zelrikriando	emack	in that case ubuntu-restricted-extras should fixed it though...
2008-08-21T06:33:00.000Z	ex-zelrikriando	emack	ok so you want to make sure you can read mp3 formats and stuff...there are forums about it :)
2008-08-21T06:34:00.000Z	ex-zelrikriando	emack	yeah make sure you restart stuff...rebooting might an option too
2008-08-21T06:45:00.000Z	ex-zelrikriando	emack	you got it to work now?
2008-08-21T06:46:00.000Z	ex-zelrikriando	emack	:/ dont give up.
2008-08-21T06:47:00.000Z	ex-zelrikriando	emack	You basically need to make sure you have all the packages you need and that those packages do not step on each other or are broken (might want to reinstall a few of them to check)
