2009-08-29T21:57:00.000Z	Guest16758	guntbert	& ubottu : I am same guest user who was asking about root password issue a while ago !
2009-08-29T21:58:00.000Z	guntbert	Guest16758	ubottu is a bot :-) - and you still don't need the root account enabled - believe me - what is the real problem about that?
2009-08-29T21:58:00.000Z	Guest16758	guntbert	I can not install a software or use sudo or su commands
2009-08-29T22:00:00.000Z	guntbert	Guest16758	lets check the sudo thing: type sudo ls - what happens?
2009-08-29T22:01:00.000Z	guntbert	Guest16758	without the -
2009-08-29T22:03:00.000Z	Guest16758	guntbert	Any breakthrough ?
2009-08-29T22:03:00.000Z	guntbert	Guest16758	the you will have to boot into recovery mode, "drop to root session", and edit the file /etc/group - there should be a line starting with admin - add your account to that line, save the file and exit/reboot
2009-08-29T22:03:00.000Z	Guest16758	guntbert	I would require root password in order to use "drop to root session"
2009-08-29T22:04:00.000Z	guntbert	Guest16758	no, not in recovery mode
2009-08-29T22:05:00.000Z	Guest16758	guntbert	It is asking for root password even in that option
2009-08-29T22:06:00.000Z	guntbert	Guest16758	then its a bit longer a way, boot into live CD, mount you local harddisk, but it will be easier when you are once in the live session to come back here
2009-08-29T22:07:00.000Z	Guest16758	guntbert	cdrom isnt working properly, it gets stuck often while reading from cd
2009-08-29T22:07:00.000Z	guntbert	Guest16758	can you boot from usb?
2009-08-29T22:07:00.000Z	Guest16758	guntbert	USB hangs
2009-08-29T22:08:00.000Z	Guest16758	guntbert	already tried those issues
2009-08-29T22:08:00.000Z	guntbert	Guest16758	are there important data in you installation? if not I'd suggest you just drop it
2009-08-29T22:09:00.000Z	Guest16758	guntbert	Yes, its a user system not mine, so cant not delete or uninstall stuff here
2009-08-29T22:10:00.000Z	guntbert	Guest16758	sorry then - I'm at the end of ideas - wait - do you have a floppy?
2009-08-29T22:10:00.000Z	Guest16758	guntbert	no floppy drives on this system
2009-08-29T22:12:00.000Z	guntbert	Guest16758	are you sure that isn't "a test, how well ubuntu support works" ? ;-) just kidding - I have really no more ideas, sorry
