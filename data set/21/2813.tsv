2009-07-10T07:34:00.000Z	bastidrazor	ascheel	gedit
2009-07-10T07:34:00.000Z	ascheel	bastidrazor	is that the one that comes in Jaunty by default?
2009-07-10T07:34:00.000Z	bastidrazor	ascheel	yes
2009-07-10T07:38:00.000Z	ascheel	bastidrazor	without the executable permissions, he won't be able to get to the sudo command or the chmod command
2009-07-10T07:39:00.000Z	ascheel	bastidrazor	that's the problem.  his / doesn't have execute.  Just r/w
2009-07-10T07:40:00.000Z	bastidrazor	ascheel	755 will give it execute ..
2009-07-10T07:40:00.000Z	ascheel	bastidrazor	he won't be able to use any command below / because it doesn't yet have execute.
2009-07-10T07:41:00.000Z	bastidrazor	ascheel	755 will give it execute
2009-07-10T07:41:00.000Z	ascheel	bastidrazor	he can't use any commands to give it execute.
2009-07-10T07:41:00.000Z	bastidrazor	ascheel	mount with liveCd then do the commands.. as i told him
2009-07-10T07:41:00.000Z	ascheel	bastidrazor	touche
2009-07-14T21:02:00.000Z	bastidrazor	ascheel	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=198049   posts 4 and 5 should help
2009-07-14T21:18:00.000Z	ascheel	bastidrazor	so if I 'update-rc.d -f gdm remove' it should prevent me from getting to the GUI altogether?
2009-07-14T21:18:00.000Z	bastidrazor	ascheel	it will stop gdm from loading yes. the only way to get to a GUI would be to manually start it.
2009-07-14T21:19:00.000Z	ascheel	bastidrazor	that's exactly what I"m lokoing for.  :)  Thanks!
2009-07-14T21:19:00.000Z	bastidrazor	ascheel	cool, enjoy.
2010-12-24T07:26:00.000Z	bastidrazor	ascheel	don't kill it, instead stop the service.. sudo service ssh stop
2010-12-24T07:27:00.000Z	ascheel	bastidrazor	Thanks a ton.  :)  I always thought /etc/init.d/service_name did the same as 'service'
2010-12-24T07:28:00.000Z	bastidrazor	ascheel	upstart has changed everything.. service controls all!
2010-12-24T07:29:00.000Z	ascheel	bastidrazor	so it seemms!~
