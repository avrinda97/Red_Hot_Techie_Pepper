2012-03-25T07:19:00.000Z	robison		under preferences > remote desktop, you get some simple settigns for setting up a remote desktop server
2012-03-25T07:20:00.000Z	robison		i really want to install that but dont see it here in lubuntu
2012-03-25T07:22:00.000Z	robison		and vino-preferences will give me what i want
2012-03-25T07:23:00.000Z	robison		only windows and mac right now

2012-03-25T07:27:00.000Z	wylde	robison	not to mention trying to xbmc over vnc will be laggy and awkward IMHO
