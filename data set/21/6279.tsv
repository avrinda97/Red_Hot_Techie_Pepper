2008-11-23T12:34:00.000Z	krish_		gnea i have pasted the error over here please check it http://paste.ubuntu.com/75870/
2008-11-23T12:35:00.000Z	Gnea	krish_	are you sure you're using the right password?
2008-11-23T12:38:00.000Z	Gnea	krish_	tried with sudo?
2008-11-23T12:39:00.000Z	Gnea	krish_	so you've been able to use this for awhile then? and it just started doing this recently?
2008-11-23T12:41:00.000Z	Gnea	krish_	did you setup your .my.cnf for root?
2008-11-23T12:42:00.000Z	Gnea	krish_	why not do that, then you can just sudo -i and call it without argument?
2008-11-23T12:48:00.000Z	Gnea	krish_	is it mysql-server-5.0 that you have installed?
2008-11-23T12:51:00.000Z	Gnea	krish_	excellent.  you can use the zless command in a terminal to read this file: /usr/share/doc/mysql-server-5.0/README.Debian.gz  in it, it explains how to set that up - look for the PASSWORDS section
2008-11-23T12:58:00.000Z	Gnea	krish_	READ it.
2008-11-23T13:00:00.000Z	Gnea	krish_	you run this command:  zless /usr/share/doc/mysql-server-5.0/README.Debian.gz    and then you use the down-arrow key to scroll down to the section called PASSWORDS
2008-11-23T13:00:00.000Z	Gnea	krish_	and then, you read it and follow directions.
2008-11-23T13:21:00.000Z	Gnea	krish_	i thought you said you had a password set already
2008-11-23T13:21:00.000Z	Gnea	krish_	then the problem is solved, don't worry about that step :)
2008-11-23T13:22:00.000Z	Gnea	krish_	are you familiar with phpmyadmin?
2008-11-23T13:23:00.000Z	Gnea	krish_	you should install it and use it. it is a very nice interface to mysql.
2008-11-23T13:23:00.000Z	Gnea	krish_	you will find user management to be extremely simplified.
2008-11-23T13:24:00.000Z	Gnea	krish_	just open firefox and point it at http://localhost/phpmyadmin/
2008-11-23T13:36:00.000Z	Gnea	krish_	awesome
2008-11-23T13:36:00.000Z	Gnea	krish_	enjoy :)
2008-11-23T13:38:00.000Z	Gnea	krish_	very cool.
