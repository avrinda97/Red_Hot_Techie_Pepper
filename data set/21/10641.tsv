2005-01-15T10:11:00.000Z	surrounder		hey all, have a question about the nvidia kernel: when I reboot the PC it doesnt get initialized so GDM doesn't start, when I insert it myself it works though...any ideas?
2005-01-15T10:12:00.000Z	jmob	surrounder	echo "nvidia" >> /etc/modules
2005-01-15T10:14:00.000Z	jmob	surrounder	you don't need to reboot
2005-01-15T10:14:00.000Z	jmob	surrounder	well, you need to reboot to test it, but it's not required...
2005-01-15T10:19:00.000Z	jmob	surrounder	you might be able to disable it with /sys
2005-01-15T10:21:00.000Z	surrounder	jmob	like just remove /sys/module/ipv6 ?
2005-01-15T10:21:00.000Z	jmob	surrounder	no!
2005-01-15T10:22:00.000Z	surrounder	jmob	how should I do it?
2005-01-15T10:22:00.000Z	jmob	surrounder	I'm not sure, I'm looking at google
2005-01-15T10:22:00.000Z	surrounder	jmob	thanks, trying the same but that ipv6 makes the whole resolving slow like hell...very annoying
2005-01-15T10:29:00.000Z	jmob	surrounder	try adding "alias ipv6 off" is /etc/modutils/aliases
2005-01-15T10:30:00.000Z	jmob	surrounder	then run ``update-modules.modutils''
2005-01-15T10:30:00.000Z	jmob	surrounder	and reboot
2005-01-15T10:36:00.000Z	surrounder	jmob	hmm...still ipv6.. :(
2005-01-15T10:37:00.000Z	jmob	surrounder	is "alias ipv6 off" in /etc/modules.conf?
2005-01-15T10:37:00.000Z	jmob	surrounder	did you reboot?
2005-01-15T10:40:00.000Z	surrounder	jmob	I put it in /etc/modutils/aliases
2005-01-15T10:41:00.000Z	jmob	surrounder	and you ran update-modules.modutils? and checked to make sure it showed up in /etc/modules.conf?
2005-01-15T10:41:00.000Z	surrounder	jmob	yup, it's there and I rebooted..
2005-01-15T10:42:00.000Z	jmob	surrounder	damn
