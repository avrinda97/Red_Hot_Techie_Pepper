2007-11-07T22:03:00.000Z	DocRohith	wels	i heard your problem with WiFi. Sounds like you might have a DNS issue.. check your dns server address
2007-11-07T22:04:00.000Z	wels	DocRohith	The DNS server is correct
2007-11-07T22:04:00.000Z	DocRohith	wels	what are u getting for ping result?
2007-11-07T22:05:00.000Z	wels	DocRohith	When I tried to ping the router, it says destination host unreachable.. and the from IP it shows is wrong
2007-11-07T22:05:00.000Z	DocRohith		release and renew your computers IP
2007-11-07T22:06:00.000Z	wels	DocRohith	I have 192.168.1.11 set for the WiFi and 192.168.1.41 set for the wired network which is currently disconnected.... When I ping the router, it says From 192.168.1.41 icmp_seq=1 Destination host unreachable... I don't know why its showing that IP instead of 192.168.1.11
2007-11-07T22:07:00.000Z	DocRohith	wels	gotcha.. did u try to restart?
2007-11-07T22:07:00.000Z	wels	DocRohith	Yes, it didn't do any good
2007-11-07T22:07:00.000Z	DocRohith	wels	if that doesn't work. REMOVE the static IP config
2007-11-07T22:07:00.000Z	DocRohith		then restart...
2007-11-07T22:09:00.000Z	DocRohith		My question more specifically... anyone here with a WORKING WWAN CARD on a SONY LAPTOP?
