2010-09-22T15:28:00.000Z	Destoned		im trying to install gnome shell, and it says fix broken crap first.. What do i do?
2010-09-22T15:28:00.000Z	jrib	Destoned	pastebin details
2010-09-22T15:32:00.000Z	jrib	Destoned	erm, ubuntu tweak is not supported
2010-09-22T15:35:00.000Z	jrib	Destoned	you've used ubuntu tweak.  That's likely why you're system is messed up now
2010-09-22T15:37:00.000Z	jrib	Destoned	you can doubt it, but it's a third party app that does sometimes not so smart things.  Thus making it a pain to support people who use it
2010-09-22T15:38:00.000Z	jrib	Destoned	ubuntu tweak is not in the repositories
2010-09-22T15:38:00.000Z	jrib	Destoned	anyway /I/ won't support it
2010-09-22T15:38:00.000Z	jrib	Destoned	if someone else wants to help you with it, that's fine.  But I'd recommend not using it
2010-09-24T15:46:00.000Z	jrib	Destoned	start by not talking in all-caps.  Did you follow the instructions ubottu gave you earlier regarding restricted formats?
2010-09-24T15:47:00.000Z	jrib	Destoned	what *exactly* is not working?
2010-09-24T15:48:00.000Z	jrib	Destoned	if you want me to help you, you need to be specific and address me when you're answering my questions
2010-09-24T15:48:00.000Z	Destoned	jrib	ok, well im trying to get divx working and it wont
2010-09-24T15:48:00.000Z	jrib	Destoned	give me an example that is not working
2010-09-24T15:49:00.000Z	jrib	Destoned	give me an EXAMPLE
2010-09-24T15:50:00.000Z	jrib	Destoned	well you can give me a specific example that I can try here or you can choose not to and just not have it working
2010-09-24T15:51:00.000Z	jrib	Destoned	is this some sort of piracy site?
2010-09-24T15:52:00.000Z	jrib	Destoned	piracy is not supported here.  Is there some non-piracy site that is not working for you?
2010-09-24T15:52:00.000Z	jrib	Destoned	then we can't help you
2010-09-24T15:53:00.000Z	jrib	Destoned	my guess is it's just some virus on that site anyway
2010-09-24T15:54:00.000Z	jrib	Destoned	I'm also pretty sure we've had this discussion before.  Don't ask about that site here please
2010-09-24T15:55:00.000Z	jrib	Destoned	please stay on the topic of ubuntu support here
