2008-04-11T16:10:00.000Z	pajamian	unop	I don't think we were actually recommending that.
2008-04-11T16:10:00.000Z	unop	pajamian	i didn't say you were :)
2008-04-11T16:10:00.000Z	pajamian	unop	and I agree, I only log onto remote boxes as a user account, I can always get root with sudo (or sometimes su)
2008-05-06T18:23:00.000Z	unop	pajamian	zgmf-x20a, you need to quote variables properly. for x in *.pdf; do convert "$x" "${x/.pdf/.jpg}"; done
2008-05-06T18:24:00.000Z	pajamian	unop	true, I forget that a lot.

2008-08-15T11:34:00.000Z	pajamian	unop	why do you think the other command didn't work?  perl is supposed to set the current dir to the program directory.
2008-08-15T11:35:00.000Z	unop	pajamian	the script is looking for files relative to some directory .. but the directory containing $0 is not in @INC
2008-08-15T11:38:00.000Z	pajamian	unop	$0 is the program name, not the startup directory.
2008-08-15T11:38:00.000Z	unop	pajamian	indeed .. but read what i said properly :)  "directory containing $0 .. "
2008-08-15T11:39:00.000Z	pajamian	unop	ahhh, yes, I see what you're saying.
2008-08-15T11:40:00.000Z	pajamian	unop	it appears to me that the script is based on something very old, probably from perl 5.0 days.
2008-08-15T11:41:00.000Z	unop	pajamian	it's mandating  the use of perl 5.8.1;  .. though, it's written horribly wrong .. no use of strict and warnings
2008-08-15T11:41:00.000Z	pajamian	unop	yeah, good point, though the #! probably came from the installer.  and I agree it's pretty bad.
2008-08-15T11:42:00.000Z	pajamian	unop	oh, and you're referring to the require line for 5.8.1, I'm guessing the original version of it is old, but it's been updated to need 5.8.1
2008-08-15T11:42:00.000Z	unop	pajamian	no, i didn't make the assumption based on the shebang but  the  require 5.8.1;  on line 15
2008-08-25T09:33:00.000Z	unop	pajamian	that will likely only remove the GDM but leave the desktop intact
2008-08-30T16:42:00.000Z	unop	pajamian	i think we are talking about his home dir here .. atleast i hope so
2008-08-30T16:41:00.000Z	unop	pajamian	700 does
2008-08-30T16:44:00.000Z	unop	pajamian	/home-dir is ambiguous .. i would err on the side of him making a typo with it
