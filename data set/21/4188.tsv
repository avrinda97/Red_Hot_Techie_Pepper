2010-08-24T06:04:00.000Z	Agu10		what's the distro with more eye-candy?
2010-08-24T06:04:00.000Z	Agu10		there's no distro dedicated to eye-candy?
2010-08-24T06:04:00.000Z	Agu10		specifically?
2010-08-24T06:06:00.000Z	coz_	Agu10	 icons and themes are easily changed and installed
2010-08-24T06:06:00.000Z	Agu10	coz_	the thing is I can't find any themes I really like
2010-08-24T06:06:00.000Z	coz_	Agu10	 and with compiz there is a script to add about 20 experimental plugins as well as a script to test the 0.9.0 compiz in C++
2010-08-24T06:07:00.000Z	coz_	Agu10	 well  you can go to  gnome-look.org  and on the left  choose  GTK2
2010-08-24T06:07:00.000Z	Agu10	coz_	ok, thanks
2010-08-24T06:07:00.000Z	Agu10		I think I prefer KDE for eye-candy
2010-08-24T06:07:00.000Z	coz_	Agu10	 these will be the themes that theme the window interiors  etc
2010-08-24T06:07:00.000Z	coz_	Agu10	  I have used most of the DE's  and I still prefer gnome  although I now use Edubuntu because of the east of i nstallation of kde applications along with it
2010-08-24T06:08:00.000Z	coz_	Agu10	 if you download and burn the minimal cd  you can choose any of those for installation
2010-08-24T06:08:00.000Z	Agu10	coz_	ok
2010-08-24T06:09:00.000Z	coz_	Agu10	    https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
2010-08-24T06:09:00.000Z	Agu10		thanks
2010-08-24T06:09:00.000Z	coz_	Agu10	 however  this is NOT a live cd
2010-08-24T06:09:00.000Z	Agu10		oh, I see
2010-08-24T06:09:00.000Z	coz_	Agu10	  this is a test install    easily followed  however there will be a point where you will get a list of what to install
2010-08-24T06:10:00.000Z	coz_	Agu10	  at that point   the arrows keys  scroll the menu and the "space" bar chooses
2010-08-24T06:10:00.000Z	coz_	Agu10	 edubuntu with the gnome desktop offers both kde and gnome libraries and applications
2010-08-24T06:10:00.000Z	coz_	Agu10	 the edubuntu kde desktop does not  but does have all of the kde niceness
