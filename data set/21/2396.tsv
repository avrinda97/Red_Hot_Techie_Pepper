2011-12-20T00:10:00.000Z	ManDay		If you are right, then I guess there is no "better" method than that.
2011-12-20T00:12:00.000Z	ManDay		MULTILIB_OPTIONS?! Never heard of. But I personally don't feel bad for my lack of knowledge on autofools
2011-12-20T00:14:00.000Z	ManDay		*normally* gcc will not require special help for finding libc files in the *standard* places.
2011-12-20T00:14:00.000Z	ManDay		The closest to an option which dicates standard search paths I came is "--with-sysdir" which won't do ubuntu right
2011-12-20T00:15:00.000Z	ManDay		Forgive me my grammer
2011-12-20T00:16:00.000Z	ManDay		Does it matter?
2011-12-20T00:16:00.000Z	ManDay		Because another software expects it.
2011-12-20T00:18:00.000Z	almoxarife	ManDay	do you have a question specific to ubuntu?
2011-12-20T00:21:00.000Z	ManDay	almoxarife	Obviously, I have.
2011-12-20T00:22:00.000Z	almoxarife	ManDay	do you have a question specific to ubuntu?
2011-12-20T00:22:00.000Z	ManDay	almoxarife	Can you perhaps shut up?
2011-12-20T00:24:00.000Z	almoxarife	ManDay	do you have a question specific to ubuntu?
2011-12-26T12:35:00.000Z	almoxarife	ManDay	google talk/voice/video , chrome/chromium
2011-12-26T12:36:00.000Z	ManDay	almoxarife	The browser as client?
2011-12-26T12:36:00.000Z	almoxarife	ManDay	yep, simple, or too simple?
2011-12-26T12:37:00.000Z	ManDay	almoxarife	Not my dream-solution. .
2011-12-26T12:38:00.000Z	almoxarife	ManDay	you want it more complicated?
2011-12-26T12:39:00.000Z	almoxarife	ManDay	fine, load broke-dick skype on either end and enjoy the lag
2011-12-26T12:39:00.000Z	almoxarife	ManDay	how about pidgin? it will run nears anything these days
2011-12-26T12:45:00.000Z	ManDay	almoxarife	Not more complicated. But a browser does't sit in n tray and it's 1st purpose is BROWSING. Tried Pidgin but it's Viedeo isn't working right. Making a VIDEO-Call is often simplyUNavailable (God knows why) and if it's available, trying to initiate it, the video-Window aborts a split second after I start it.
2011-12-26T16:14:00.000Z	ManDay	almoxarife	I'm looking for Ubn Software. Hardly OT.
