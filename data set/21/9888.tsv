2005-08-09T10:53:00.000Z	lunitik	znh	because the guy that pays for the developement uses gnome
2005-09-08T14:30:00.000Z	lunitik	znh	if he doesn't know how to add it himself... you likely dont' have to tell him about source repo's... it will just slow down his apt-get update process
2005-09-08T14:31:00.000Z	znh	lunitik	Demitar: they aren't by default in the sources
2005-09-08T14:31:00.000Z	lunitik	znh	I know.. he still doesn't need the source repo...
2005-09-08T14:32:00.000Z	znh	lunitik	sharp indeed..
2005-09-08T14:36:00.000Z	lunitik	znh	thats installed by default
2005-09-08T14:36:00.000Z	znh	lunitik	negative
2005-09-08T14:36:00.000Z	znh	lunitik	or has it been added last days :/ ?
2005-09-08T14:37:00.000Z	znh	lunitik	the standard nvidia drivers doens't have 3D Acceleration
2005-09-08T14:37:00.000Z	znh	lunitik	and 'ignore znh' is _not_ kind at all!
2005-09-08T14:38:00.000Z	lunitik	znh	all you have said is misinformation... pointing him at the correct page on the wiki is more useful
2005-09-08T14:38:00.000Z	lunitik	znh	nvidia drivers are in restricted _NOT_ multiverse!!!
2005-09-08T14:39:00.000Z	znh	lunitik	they were never in restricted when I tried to install the nvidia drivers.. also ubuntuguide.org confirms that
2005-09-08T14:41:00.000Z	lunitik	znh	They certainly aren't in multiverse
2005-09-08T14:49:00.000Z	znh	lunitik	at least 300 people in here might agree that Seveas is not hard to deal with
2005-09-08T14:49:00.000Z	lunitik	znh	most of those 300 people haven't been here as long as the people that hold my point of view
2005-09-08T14:51:00.000Z	lunitik	znh	NO... something is wrong with his configuration...
2005-09-08T14:51:00.000Z	lunitik	znh	he needs to post his /var/log/Xorg.0.log somewhere to see what might be wrong
2005-09-08T14:51:00.000Z	znh	lunitik	he didn't tell anything about a wrong configuration.. only that he had to restart X, and that's normal
2005-09-08T14:56:00.000Z	lunitik	znh	wrong stance to take.... help if you are sure you know the answer... but if you aren't 100% sure... then you do more harm than good
2005-09-08T14:57:00.000Z	znh	lunitik	oh that makes me feel good
