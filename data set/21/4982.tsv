2009-06-23T16:38:00.000Z	chevdor		just a quick note to those who kept saying we cannot boot up on a RAID1/10 array, it IS possible and it works.
2009-06-23T16:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chevdor	sure is, get a raid card and you can have any level of raid yo desire
2009-06-23T16:40:00.000Z	chevdor	ActionParsnip	well people kepts saying this is not possible :) I am using no raid card but the NVIDIA nForce4 on chipset, also called FakeRaid or whatever
2009-06-23T16:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chevdor	yeah fakeraid suck imho
2009-06-23T16:41:00.000Z	chevdor	ActionParsnip	fakeraid works imo :) (not enough experience using it to say it sucks), so far the bench under windows showed great results, windows installs in 8 minutes....
2009-06-23T16:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chevdor	try a raid card with 256Mb cache
2009-06-23T16:42:00.000Z	chevdor	ActionParsnip	pci ?
2009-06-23T16:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chevdor	pci-x
2009-06-23T16:42:00.000Z	chevdor	ActionParsnip	because then you are limited to the pci / pci-x bandwidth
2009-06-23T16:44:00.000Z	chevdor	ActionParsnip	you are running it ? what is the price ? that would be nice to compare
2009-06-23T16:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chevdor	its less bursty though due to the cache
2009-06-23T16:45:00.000Z	chevdor	ActionParsnip	with my current solution, cache is not bad because I have 4x32Mo... well let's count 2x32Mo because Mirroring does not improve speed
2009-06-23T16:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chevdor	and raid0 isntstrictly raid ;)
2009-06-23T16:47:00.000Z	chevdor	ActionParsnip	that sounds like trolling... I won't go into this and just say : yes indeed, thus the name "0", and I don't use raid 0 anyway but raid 10
2009-06-23T16:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chevdor	well theres no redundncy in raid0, and the r in raid stands for redundant
2009-06-23T16:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chevdor	it uses the same mechanics of multiple drive acces but isnt true raid
2009-06-23T16:49:00.000Z	chevdor	ActionParsnip	raid 0 has been a result of the RAID architecture, now the meaning of raid is more 'multiple disks'. Now I agree w/ you, when someone says I use raid0 to make it more secure, i start feeling bad :)
2009-06-23T16:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chevdor	true but theres still no redundancy so isnt true raid in a sense of the acronym
2009-06-23T16:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chevdor	otherwise you are right
2009-06-23T16:50:00.000Z	chevdor	ActionParsnip	do you run your pci-x card on your pc ? Do you know of a linux hd benchmark software ? if so, we could compare, that would be fun :)))
2009-06-23T16:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chevdor	no idea duder
