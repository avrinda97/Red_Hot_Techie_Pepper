2007-02-22T16:01:00.000Z	Landon		I can still gedit it
2007-02-22T16:01:00.000Z	Neil3	Landon	hm you could try apt-get install ubuntu-desktop as that's a metapackage containing lots of stuff
2007-02-22T16:02:00.000Z	Neil3		sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop of course... :)
2007-02-22T16:02:00.000Z	Landon	Neil3	I tried that, it gave me something weird
2007-02-22T16:02:00.000Z	Neil3		damn
2007-02-22T16:03:00.000Z	Landon	Neil3	It says it has unmet dependency's
2007-02-22T16:03:00.000Z	Neil3		try sudo apt-get update
2007-02-22T16:03:00.000Z	Neil3		then try installing again
2007-02-22T16:04:00.000Z	Landon		As soon as it gets to "Connecting to packages.freecontrib.org" it pretty much freezes
2007-02-22T16:04:00.000Z	Landon		Site down?
2007-02-22T16:06:00.000Z	Landon		Don't know
2007-02-22T16:07:00.000Z	Landon		Hahaha, i'm talking here
2007-02-22T16:08:00.000Z	Landon		I found all the files it was going to remove and did
2007-02-22T16:08:00.000Z	Landon		Should I just sudo apt-get install all of them?
2007-02-22T16:09:00.000Z	Landon		I can do it in one line, might as well?
2007-02-22T16:11:00.000Z	Neil3	Landon	yeah a one liner apt-get install will work
2007-02-22T16:12:00.000Z	Landon	Neil3	Trying that now
2007-02-22T16:12:00.000Z	Neil3		good luck Landon
2007-02-22T16:13:00.000Z	Landon		Thanks, I think I'm going to need it :)
2007-02-22T16:37:00.000Z	Landon	Neil3	Hey, need help again
2007-02-22T16:38:00.000Z	Landon	Neil3	So I was going through the dpkg.log file, and I can't figure out what the files are called from the log file!
