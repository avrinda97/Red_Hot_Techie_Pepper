2007-06-11T09:23:00.000Z	DBlue		I had installed an 32 bit Ubuntu 7.04 on AMD 64, why the 32 bit version fucntion, and is it ok that, can it damaged the machine?
2007-06-11T09:23:00.000Z	zipper	DBlue	worst thing that can happend, is failure to boot up the kernel
2007-06-11T09:24:00.000Z	zipper	DBlue	although i bet running 32bit on a 64bit cpu would work, you wouldnt get optimal performance
2007-06-11T09:25:00.000Z	zipper	DBlue	well, you can use the "nv" driver instead, but then you wont get hardware accelleration
2007-06-11T09:28:00.000Z	zipper	DBlue	in ubuntu, we use "sudo" instead
2007-06-11T09:28:00.000Z	zipper	DBlue	like, "sudo vim /etc/X11/xorg.conf"
2007-06-11T09:31:00.000Z	zipper	DBlue	no worries, its the only way to learn. Asking, and more important: READING
2007-06-11T09:32:00.000Z	zipper	DBlue	neither should you. It's okay to ask a lot when being new.
2007-06-11T09:33:00.000Z	zipper	DBlue	just expect to be pointed in the direction of a lot of guides/articles.
2007-06-11T09:33:00.000Z	zipper	DBlue	referens?
2007-06-11T09:34:00.000Z	zipper	DBlue	linux uses something called openGL (mostly) - it's used in games like quake and unreal tournament, which is why they run GREAT in linux (i get better fps than in windows)
2007-06-11T09:35:00.000Z	zipper	DBlue	its already there. You probably just need to install a driver for your gfx card in order to use it.
