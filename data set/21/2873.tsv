2009-12-20T23:04:00.000Z	buttons840		can anyone help me with vi (vim) i am unable to delete line feeds.   when i'm backspacing and hit column 1 i cannot go up the the next line, and i cannot use the delete key either     i have used vi/vim on many distros and never had any trouble with it except in ubuntu 9.10
2009-12-20T23:05:00.000Z	jtaji	buttons840	you probably only have vim-tiny installed, which is default I believe, you probably want either vim-nox or vim-gnome installed
2009-12-20T23:06:00.000Z	buttons840	jtaji	perhaps, but i wonder why a proper vi install doesn't come in the distro?   currently it is literally impossible to delete a line feed using vi
2009-12-20T23:07:00.000Z	jtaji	buttons840	because only so much fits in the default install, and the default command line text editor is actually nano
2009-12-20T23:07:00.000Z	jtaji	buttons840	all you need to do is sudo aptitude install vim-nox
2009-12-20T23:09:00.000Z	buttons840	jtaji	ok, i just wish i could have a proper teminal editor before i get online (as it takes some doing to get this computer online)   i've never had problem with past ubuntus or other distros
2009-12-20T23:13:00.000Z	buttons840		if vim-nox is really what i need to be able to erase line feeds then i would highly suggest (to any powers that be) that the 2 megabyte program be included on the live disk (which i know had 2 megs free)
2009-12-20T23:17:00.000Z	buttons840		jta
2009-12-20T23:17:00.000Z	buttons840	jtaji	i have vim-common installed, is that not good enough ( i also have vim-tiny)
2009-12-20T23:18:00.000Z	jtaji	buttons840	vim-common isn't the binary, you only have vim-tiny
2009-12-20T23:20:00.000Z	buttons840	jtaji	synaptic shows vim-common as installed, when i apt-get install vim-common it says it's already installed; so perhaps this is another problem I have?    another interesting this is that vi (the one that comes installed on the distro) work on my other computer, but not here, which makes me suspect a configuation problem with the keyboard possibly
2009-12-20T23:20:00.000Z	jtaji	buttons840	you want vim-nox, or vim-gnome
2009-12-20T23:20:00.000Z	jtaji	buttons840	I've always encountered that with vim-tiny, it acts more like original vi
2009-12-20T23:21:00.000Z	buttons840	jtaji	i don't have vim-nox installed on my other computer and it works; so i don't believe that i do need it
2009-12-20T23:21:00.000Z	jtaji	buttons840	vim-nox also gives you the fully featured vim, vim-tiny is quite crippled in comparison
2009-12-20T23:22:00.000Z	buttons840	jtaji	do you know what vim-common is?
2009-12-20T23:22:00.000Z	jtaji	buttons840	it's all the bits that are common to all forms of the binary
2009-12-20T23:22:00.000Z	jtaji	buttons840	for example: vim-tiny, vim-nox, vim-gnome, there are others too I think
2009-12-20T23:22:00.000Z	jtaji	buttons840	those give you the binary compiled with more or less options
2009-12-20T23:23:00.000Z	jtaji	buttons840	and possibly additional files necessary for that version
2009-12-20T23:26:00.000Z	buttons840	jtaji	ok, vim-nox is working for me; thanks       sorry if i seem frustrated, it's because i am :)    i'd really like a proper terminal editor for use before i get online
