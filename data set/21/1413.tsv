2012-01-18T16:20:00.000Z	th^2		what would be the most effective way to make ubuntu faster?
2012-01-18T16:22:00.000Z	deitarion	th^2	Have you tried using LXDE via `apt-get install lubuntu-desktop`?
2012-01-18T16:23:00.000Z	th^2	deitarion	X11 you mean?
2012-01-18T16:24:00.000Z	deitarion	th^2	X11 is the graphical subsystem on which all full-featured X11 desktops depend. Using it in this context isn't really meaningful.
2012-01-18T16:25:00.000Z	th^2	deitarion	sub-system? like unity? :S
2012-01-18T16:26:00.000Z	deitarion	th^2	How much do you know about how a Linux desktop is put together?
2012-01-18T16:27:00.000Z	th^2	deitarion	theres the X server :D
2012-01-18T16:28:00.000Z	deitarion	th^2	The X server handles managing access to the screen, keyboard, and mouse between multiple applications. On top of that, you have a window manager (draws window borders, handles focus, resizing, and dragging, etc.)
2012-01-18T16:29:00.000Z	deitarion	th^2	You also have a program which draws your desktop icons (if you have them) and a program which draws your panels (launcher menu, task bar, etc.)
2012-01-18T16:30:00.000Z	th^2	deitarion	so in basic ubuntu installation theres xserver and top of that unity? what else?
2012-01-18T16:31:00.000Z	deitarion	th^2	Unity is the panel program. The window manager is Compiz. Last I checked, the desktop icons were drawn by Nautilus. There's also a bunch of other components. All of them are heavy because they value glitz.
2012-01-18T16:32:00.000Z	th^2	deitarion	its funny because linux is considered as light weight alternative for windows..
2012-01-18T16:32:00.000Z	deitarion	th^2	SOME Linux is considered a light-weight alternative.
2012-01-18T16:33:00.000Z	deitarion	th^2	The combination of Unity and Compiz is trying to compete with Windows and MacOS for graphical glitz, so it's not lightweight.
2012-01-18T16:33:00.000Z	th^2	deitarion	to me basic ubuntu doesnt seem to be any faster than win7...
2012-01-18T16:34:00.000Z	deitarion	th^2	It probably isn't... but it was faster than Vista and, if you start into something lighter than Unity+Compiz, it WILL be faster.
2012-01-18T16:34:00.000Z	deitarion	th^2	KDE 4 is about as heavy as Unity+Compiz, so that's out.. but Xfce is as light as GNOME 2 and LXDE is even lighter.
2012-01-18T16:37:00.000Z	deitarion	th^2	The main thing you have to understand is that what you know as "Linux" is a stack of bits and pieces that you can mix and match. Replace the heavy bits and your system will look more plain, but be faster.
2012-01-18T16:38:00.000Z	th^2	deitarion	yes im aware of that. have been using zenlinux on my laptop for 2 years. its pretty fast but not suitable for desktop
2012-01-18T16:40:00.000Z	deitarion	th^2	Give LXDE a try with `apt-get install lubuntu-desktop`. That's reasonably polished (I use it as my only desktop interface) and quite light. If it turns out you need something a little more polished, explore `apt-get install xubuntu-desktop`. You can mix and match components from the two to get the feature set you want. (eg. Xfce devs explicitly refuse to implement tabbing in their file manager)
