2005-11-22T06:55:00.000Z	maddash		how do I join other channels?
2005-11-22T06:56:00.000Z	bimberi	maddash	/join #channel
2005-12-04T07:52:00.000Z	bimberi	maddash	try adding it to /etc/hotplug/blacklist
2005-12-04T07:55:00.000Z	maddash	bimberi	how could I uninstall it?
2005-12-04T07:56:00.000Z	bimberi	maddash	i wouldn't, better to find what is loading it - hotplug is one possibility and adding it to the blacklist will stop it doing so
2005-12-04T07:59:00.000Z	maddash	bimberi	I searched through hotplug scripts for references to "sony", and I got none.
2005-12-04T07:59:00.000Z	maddash	bimberi	would this have anything to do with /proc/modules?
2005-12-04T07:59:00.000Z	bimberi	maddash	i don't know sorry
2005-12-04T07:59:00.000Z	bimberi	maddash	did adding it to blacklist not work?
2005-12-04T08:00:00.000Z	maddash	bimberi	yeah - it didn't
2005-12-04T08:02:00.000Z	bimberi	maddash	ah, unfortunately i'm not sure what to try from there :/
2007-01-04T06:31:00.000Z	bimberi	maddash	/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
2007-01-04T06:32:00.000Z	maddash	bimberi	should I create one b/c it doesn't exist in /etc/modprobes.d
2007-01-04T06:32:00.000Z	bimberi	maddash	yes, and add lines like "blacklist modulename" to it
2007-01-04T06:35:00.000Z	maddash	bimberi	just curious, is there anyway for me to delete the module itself? would that prevent it from loading at all?
2007-01-04T06:36:00.000Z	bimberi	maddash	take ikonia's advice :)
2007-01-04T06:36:00.000Z	maddash	bimberi	ikonia: why?
2007-01-04T06:38:00.000Z	bimberi	maddash	by recompiling the kernel with a config that says not to compile that module
2007-01-04T06:39:00.000Z	maddash	bimberi	I thought the kernel modules were swap-out/in-able. after all, if I have to recompile the kernel, then how do modprobe -r  and rmmod work?
2007-01-04T11:36:00.000Z	bimberi	maddash	do a contents search on http://packages.ubuntu.com
2007-01-04T11:38:00.000Z	maddash	bimberi	doh! thanks
