2009-09-25T08:06:00.000Z	user01		is there any way to put an animated wall paper?
2009-09-25T08:07:00.000Z	user01		how can I install flashplayer or any youtube video player in ubuntu 64?
2009-09-25T08:07:00.000Z	soreau	user01	You can with xwinwrap though it's quite old, it still works. You can set a screensaver or movie using it
2009-09-25T08:22:00.000Z	soreau	user01	Actually, do you have python 2.5 installed? python --version
2009-09-25T08:20:00.000Z	soreau	user01	How did you install gdesklets?
2009-09-25T08:20:00.000Z	user01	soreau	using the add/remove from applications
2009-09-25T08:20:00.000Z	soreau	user01	Does 'which gdesklets' show any output?
2009-09-25T08:21:00.000Z	user01	soreau	bash: /usr/bin/gdesklets: /usr/bin/python2.5: bad interpreter: No such file or directory
2009-09-25T08:22:00.000Z	soreau	user01	That's weird
2009-09-25T08:23:00.000Z	user01	soreau	2.6.2
2009-09-25T08:23:00.000Z	user01	soreau	could it be the fact that I use ubuntu in 64 bit?
2009-09-25T08:23:00.000Z	soreau	user01	That's the problem. It's looking for python 2.5 but you have 2.6 installed.
2009-09-25T08:24:00.000Z	user01	soreau	ohh ok, any idea on how to fix it?
2009-09-25T08:24:00.000Z	soreau	user01	Can you run any other python app like 'ccsm' for example?
2009-09-25T08:24:00.000Z	user01	soreau	yes, it runs
2009-09-25T08:24:00.000Z	soreau	user01	Then I'd say it's a bug with gdesklets. You need a version of it that is for python 2.6
2009-09-25T08:25:00.000Z	user01	soreau	hmmm
2009-09-25T08:25:00.000Z	user01	soreau	is there any other desklets app?
2009-09-25T08:25:00.000Z	soreau	user01	screenlets
2009-09-25T08:27:00.000Z	user01	soreau	thanks
2009-09-25T08:27:00.000Z	soreau	user01	no problem
