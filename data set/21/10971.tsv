2011-06-09T00:58:00.000Z	n00blet		and that one
2011-06-09T00:58:00.000Z	n00blet		they told me to use the openSUSE patches
2011-06-09T01:00:00.000Z	n00blet		my main question though is the differences between Wubi installer and an Ubuntu Partition
2011-06-09T01:00:00.000Z	n00blet		oh ok
2011-06-09T01:01:00.000Z	n00blet		So even if the Wifi card works in Windows it wont work in Ubuntu through Wubi
2011-06-09T01:01:00.000Z	n00blet		Because that is my problem, Ubuntu doesnt even detect that my computer has a Wireless card @_@
2011-06-09T01:02:00.000Z	n00blet		no
2011-06-09T01:02:00.000Z	n00blet		My ethernet works though
2011-06-09T01:02:00.000Z	hypatia	n00blet	using wubi won't make a non-working-in-ubuntu wifi card work, it's not like using a virtual machine
2011-06-09T01:03:00.000Z	hypatia	n00blet	wubi more or less uses the windows bootloader to bootstrap a virtual parition image stored on your windows partition
2011-06-09T01:04:00.000Z	hypatia	n00blet	if you're just playing around with ubuntu it's totally fine
2011-06-09T01:04:00.000Z	hypatia	n00blet	what wifi card is it?
2011-06-09T01:05:00.000Z	hypatia	n00blet	doesn't work with ndis?
2011-06-09T01:06:00.000Z	hypatia	n00blet	you've got a bunch of options - use ubuntu in a VM, replace the wifi card, or use a USB wireless card
2011-06-09T01:07:00.000Z	hypatia	n00blet	:(
2011-06-09T01:07:00.000Z	hypatia	n00blet	oh i have one of those too, what a pain
2011-06-09T01:08:00.000Z	hypatia	n00blet	try double-clicking really quickly and then dragging
2011-06-09T01:11:00.000Z	hypatia	n00blet	looks like there's a driver written for that ralink, so it should be a matter of time before someone packages it for 11.04
