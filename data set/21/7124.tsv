2006-11-25T10:54:00.000Z	dabaR	Fall2Hell	make a check on the CD, it is an option there
2006-11-25T10:55:00.000Z	dabaR	Fall2Hell	that would likely mean something is wrong with the CD. did you burn the CD from a .iso file?
2006-11-25T10:55:00.000Z	dabaR	Fall2Hell	I guess that was not even necessary to ask...did you check the md5sum of the .iso file you have?
2006-11-25T10:56:00.000Z	dabaR	Fall2Hell	are you in windows?
2006-11-25T10:57:00.000Z	dabaR	Fall2Hell	you know how?
2006-11-25T11:00:00.000Z	dabaR	Fall2Hell	sorry, had to find a link, http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/iso shows how to check near the bottom.
2006-11-25T11:14:00.000Z	Fall2Hell	dabaR	ive checked it the iso its ok
2006-11-25T11:14:00.000Z	dabaR	Fall2Hell	well, I can not think of much else to do about this particular .iso other than burning another CD. YOu can try the alternate CD download if you have the desktop now, or vise versa.
2006-11-25T11:15:00.000Z	Fall2Hell	dabaR	the laternate cd how do i install it is it bootable?
2006-11-25T11:16:00.000Z	Fall2Hell	dabaR	never used it before
2006-11-25T11:16:00.000Z	dabaR	Fall2Hell	it is the old installation way, more similar to the windows install process. The desktop CD boots ubuntu, and has an install icon that runs the install program like all other programs such as firefox. The alternate CD boots into the installer program.
