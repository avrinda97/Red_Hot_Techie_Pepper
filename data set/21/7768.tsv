2008-04-23T14:28:00.000Z	cpk1	JPSman	 just build your own rt2x00 drivers?
2008-04-23T14:28:00.000Z	cpk1	JPSman	then you can boot into 2.6.22 kernel just fine
2008-04-23T14:32:00.000Z	cpk1	JPSman	ahh, i see since they switched to being in the kernel tree to get the newest you need the newest kernel, that might be more work than you want =P otherwise you might be able to try the legacy drivers
2008-04-23T14:33:00.000Z	cpk1	JPSman	which rt chipset you have?
2008-04-23T14:34:00.000Z	cpk1	JPSman	so why dont you just try building the driver from this http://rt2x00.serialmonkey.com/rt2500-cvs-daily.tar.gz instead of going through all the trouble of manually getting .22 kernel headers and whatnot
2008-04-23T14:36:00.000Z	cpk1	JPSman	you will have just as much trouble installing kernel headers as you would building the drivers
2008-04-23T14:39:00.000Z	cpk1	JPSman	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/RalinkRT2500?highlight=%28ralink%29 is a good place to start
2008-04-23T14:42:00.000Z	cpk1	JPSman	I am pretty sure that link I gave you explains both methods of getting ralink cards to work so read up =)
2008-04-23T14:45:00.000Z	cpk1	JPSman	make sure you disable the rt2x00 driver!
2008-04-23T15:19:00.000Z	cpk1	JPSman	if you are using the 2.6.24 kernel on hardy you can use apt to get the kernel headers, if you are on gutsy you can get the .22 headers from apt
2008-04-23T15:20:00.000Z	cpk1	JPSman	no
2008-04-23T15:21:00.000Z	cpk1	JPSman	but like I said before, if the only reason you want to use .22 is because of the wireless you might as well use .24 since you are building the drivers yourself
2008-04-23T15:22:00.000Z	cpk1	JPSman	you don't have an ethernet port?
2008-04-23T15:24:00.000Z	cpk1	JPSman	you can use everything out of bin and sbin dont worry
2008-04-23T15:25:00.000Z	cpk1	JPSman	did you read this page at all? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/RalinkRT2500?highlight=%28ralink%29
2008-04-23T15:25:00.000Z	cpk1	JPSman	section 4.4 seems pretty easy to follow
2008-04-23T15:27:00.000Z	cpk1	JPSman	since you are in the .22 kernel though will will need to replace the $(uname -r) in linux-headers-$(uname -r) with the correct version for .24 which you will be using
2008-04-23T15:27:00.000Z	cpk1	JPSman	you can install build essential and the kernel headers
2008-04-23T15:28:00.000Z	cpk1	JPSman	save that web page to your computer so after you get the .24 kernels you can boot into .24 and finish compiling the kernel and loading it
2008-04-23T15:31:00.000Z	cpk1	JPSman	keep in mind also you might have to blacklist the headers that came with the .24 kernel
2008-04-23T15:32:00.000Z	cpk1	JPSman	basically tell the computer not to use the driver in the .24 kernel, that wiki page you are looking at also has a section about that
