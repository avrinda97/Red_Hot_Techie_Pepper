2010-10-08T07:43:00.000Z	collosi	tanstaafl	 if sda2 is an extended should you have an sda5 or something like that?
2010-10-08T07:43:00.000Z	tanstaafl	collosi	yeah, i have a sda5 - its a swap though
2010-10-08T07:44:00.000Z	collosi		tanstaffl:  so where is your linux partition?
2010-10-08T07:45:00.000Z	tanstaafl	collosi	good question. it doesn't seem to be there at all
2010-10-08T07:45:00.000Z	collosi		tanstaffl:  did you boot into a livecd and check with fdisk?
2010-10-08T07:45:00.000Z	tanstaafl		yeah, im running the live cd now
2010-10-08T07:46:00.000Z	collosi	tanstaafl	 what do you seen when you type: sudo fdisk -l
2010-10-08T07:46:00.000Z	tanstaafl		i'll send it over, one sec
2010-10-08T07:48:00.000Z	tanstaafl	collosi	http://pastebin.com/Kh7kbrXH
2010-10-08T07:49:00.000Z	tanstaafl		there's fdisk
2010-10-08T07:53:00.000Z	collosi		tanstaafle:  looks like it was deleted.  Sorry, but it looks like you will have to re-install
2010-10-08T07:53:00.000Z	tanstaafl	collosi	i dunno what's up with it. it's rather odd
2010-10-08T07:54:00.000Z	collosi		tanstaffl: if sure is, but I can assure you there is no linux partition in there
2010-10-08T07:54:00.000Z	tanstaafl		that's what my conclusion was also. except i know there was
2010-10-08T07:54:00.000Z	tanstaafl		how could the entire partion just go away?
2010-10-08T07:55:00.000Z	collosi	tanstaafl	 if it was deleted, im guessing
2010-10-08T07:56:00.000Z	tanstaafl	collosi	heh, yeah that would do it. but how? could the starting cylindar have failed or something on that partion and just taken the whole thing with it?
2010-10-08T07:56:00.000Z	tanstaafl		the partion was never manually deleted
2010-10-08T07:57:00.000Z	tanstaafl		something either failed and it whiped itself, or ubuntu screwdup somewhere and reformated it
2010-10-08T07:57:00.000Z	collosi	tanstaafl	 I really don't have any idea, seems really odd.
2010-10-08T07:59:00.000Z	tanstaafl	collosi	just pulled up disk utilty on the live cd, and it does say there are a few bad sectors from the SMART data
