2011-02-17T10:40:00.000Z	arand	KXTwo	If you go to System>Administration>System Monitor, on the first tab you will find the version number and codename of your release
2011-02-17T11:17:00.000Z	arand	KXTwo	I think you should be able to disable gdm starting via the Services, item in the admin menu.
2011-02-17T11:18:00.000Z	KXTwo	arand	what?
2011-02-17T11:18:00.000Z	KXTwo	arand	disable gdm?

2011-02-17T11:29:00.000Z	arand	KXTwo	Generally you just want the xchat package, maybe the xchat-gnome one if you specifically prefer it.
2011-02-17T11:30:00.000Z	KXTwo	arand	do you see where my confusion is?  Ive never used this packet manager, in the future how do I know which choice is the right choice?
2011-02-17T11:31:00.000Z	arand	KXTwo	If you use the Software centre there is generally only one item shown per piece of software
2011-02-17T11:31:00.000Z	KXTwo	arand	software center?
2011-02-17T11:32:00.000Z	arand	KXTwo	Accesible from the applications menu
2011-02-17T11:33:00.000Z	arand	KXTwo	normally no.
