2006-12-24T06:14:00.000Z	ubuntu_		ok, since I'm on the livecd... Redo it all (grmbl)
2006-12-24T06:14:00.000Z	ubuntu_		Anyone knows where dpkg puts it's downloaded .deb files?
2006-12-24T06:15:00.000Z	ubuntu_		Maybe I can backup those, so I don't have to redownload those...
2006-12-24T06:15:00.000Z	ubuntu_		hmm, don't tell me dpkg or apt-get or aptitude removes those .deb files?
2006-12-24T06:16:00.000Z	ubuntu_		I don't need to clean my cache... I need to backup it ^^
2006-12-24T06:17:00.000Z	ubuntu_		Whoooow!
2006-12-24T06:17:00.000Z	ubuntu_		No complaints about my download prolly ^^
2006-12-24T06:17:00.000Z	ubuntu_		I can backup all the stuff I needed for the upgrade, since it's still there :)
2006-12-24T06:18:00.000Z	ubuntu_		Now, where will I put that?
2006-12-24T06:18:00.000Z	ubuntu_		I can't write on ntfs :(
2006-12-24T06:18:00.000Z	Boglizk	ubuntu_	: Thats why you make a FAT32 partition ;D
2006-12-24T06:33:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Boglizk	reboot in windows twice
2006-12-24T06:33:00.000Z	Boglizk	ubuntu_	Huh?
2006-12-24T06:34:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Boglizk	the ntfs filesystem sometimes needs checking
2006-12-24T06:34:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Boglizk	owh...
2006-12-24T06:35:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Boglizk	give your normal user access...
2006-12-24T06:35:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Boglizk	are you using some sort of ntfs driver?
2006-12-24T06:35:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Boglizk	fuse-like?
2006-12-24T06:35:00.000Z	Boglizk	ubuntu_	Nope, nothing
2006-12-24T06:36:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Boglizk	umount first, then pmount (as normal user, without sudo)
2006-12-24T06:38:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Boglizk	now, how is the pmount working?
