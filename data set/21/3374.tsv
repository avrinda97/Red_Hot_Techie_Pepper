2009-01-11T11:59:00.000Z	Cotowar		the ./flashplayer-installer should be in the package
2009-01-11T11:59:00.000Z	Cotowar		i think...
2009-01-11T11:59:00.000Z	Cotowar		im not that awesome with linux, all i really do is programming and facebook
2009-01-11T12:00:00.000Z	Cotowar		but honestly im just trying to think of all the things that i get stuck on myself
2009-01-11T12:02:00.000Z	Cotowar		apt-get vs. aptitude....everyone's thoughts?
2009-01-11T12:03:00.000Z	Cotowar		Cid: doesn't apt-get just get the stuff you ask it to get though?
2009-01-11T12:04:00.000Z	Cotowar		Cid: dependencies
2009-01-11T12:04:00.000Z	Cotowar		Cid: I've heard the difference is that aptitude will remove the dependencies if you used it to install, whereas apt-get will leave them there
2009-01-11T12:05:00.000Z	Cotowar		Cid: i fear extraneous files...it reminds me of my windows days...
2009-01-11T12:05:00.000Z	tritium	Cotowar	no longer an issue, since apt-get autoremove does the same thing
2009-01-11T13:16:00.000Z	tritium	Cotowar	with the screen resolution applet
2009-01-11T13:19:00.000Z	Cotowar	tritium	the applet doesnt see the external at all. its like its not even plugged in.
2009-02-04T07:38:00.000Z	tritium	Cotowar	^^
2009-02-04T07:39:00.000Z	Cotowar	tritium	i set mine on the install
2009-02-04T07:39:00.000Z	tritium	Cotowar	that option is not given during install
2009-02-04T07:41:00.000Z	tritium	Cotowar	ubuntu's installer doesn't provide that option.  You must be mistaken.
2009-02-04T07:42:00.000Z	tritium	Cotowar	as I said, you're mistaken
2009-02-04T07:44:00.000Z	tritium	Cotowar	it does not.  Trust me.
2009-02-04T07:45:00.000Z	tritium	Cotowar	nope, not without first enabling the root account
2009-02-04T07:48:00.000Z	tritium	Cotowar	I've given you the URL for that already.
2009-02-04T07:49:00.000Z	tritium	Cotowar	please just read the URL above.
