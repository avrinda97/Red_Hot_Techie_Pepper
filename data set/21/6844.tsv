2008-04-25T10:19:00.000Z	FastZ	unop	Ubuntu server comes with LAMP packages by default now?
2008-04-25T10:20:00.000Z	unop	FastZ	yep
2008-04-25T10:21:00.000Z	FastZ	unop	when did LAMP become standard package install?  with 7.10 it wasnt default I dont think...or was it?  i did a dist-upgrade for that version

2008-04-25T10:24:00.000Z	unop	FastZ	i think it was fiesty when it was introducted, i can't be sure
2008-04-25T10:25:00.000Z	FastZ	unop	maybe it was...i'm not sure.  I havent done a fresh install on my server machine since dapper and it's been a LAMP server ever since.
2008-04-25T10:26:00.000Z	unop	FastZ	looks like even dapper had it - http://www.debianadmin.com/ubuntu-lamp-server-installation-with-screenshots.html
2008-04-25T10:27:00.000Z	FastZ	unop	if i remember correctly, you had the option at initial installation to install the LAMP server...or a regular server
2008-04-25T10:27:00.000Z	FastZ	unop	regular server being one without the AMP part of the LAMP install
2008-04-25T10:27:00.000Z	unop	FastZ	well, if you install and use tasksell , you have the option on any ubuntu/debian machine :)

2008-05-01T12:10:00.000Z	unop	FastZ	not recommended .. better like this.  sudo sh -c "EDITOR=gedit visudo"
2008-05-01T12:11:00.000Z	FastZ	unop	what's what with using gksudo gedit /etc/sudoers?
2008-05-01T12:11:00.000Z	unop	FastZ	no locking
2008-05-01T12:11:00.000Z	FastZ	unop	which means?
2008-05-01T12:12:00.000Z	unop	FastZ	why do you think visudo was written .. it locks /etc/sudoers before opening it up for editing so as to prevent any nasty surpises
2008-05-01T12:12:00.000Z	FastZ	unop	that's why you make a copy of your file before you edit it.
2008-05-01T12:13:00.000Z	unop	FastZ	visduo also checks the syntax of /etc/sudoers, thats very important
2008-05-01T12:22:00.000Z	FastZ	unop	i guarantee an average 8 year old has seen far worse that the word they used already in their lifetime
2008-05-01T12:22:00.000Z	unop	FastZ	that's no excuse to carry on using profane language
2008-05-01T12:22:00.000Z	FastZ	unop	not saying it is
