2011-12-02T13:28:00.000Z	Newb		wth
2011-12-02T13:28:00.000Z	ikonia	Newb	read the links, not just the factoid
2011-12-02T13:20:00.000Z	ikonia	Newb	the sudo permissions model is used for security, that is why the root account is locked by default
2011-12-02T13:21:00.000Z	ikonia	Newb	no, but the concept is similar
2011-12-02T13:23:00.000Z	ikonia	Newb	if you are comfortable setting the root password and working as root, good for you, and you should know how to do that, in which case, you are fine. Most people don't so the security decision is taken to protect them
2011-12-02T13:26:00.000Z	ikonia	Newb	it's not "anti-root" it's a security model as the factoids you've been given show
2011-12-02T13:26:00.000Z	ikonia	Newb	have a proper read of them
2011-12-02T13:27:00.000Z	ikonia	Newb	check out the links there
2011-12-02T13:29:00.000Z	ikonia	Newb	I'll send them to a pm for you
2011-12-02T13:29:00.000Z	ikonia	Newb	you should have a private message from the user ubottu

2011-12-02T13:30:00.000Z	ikonia	Newb	what are you talking about ????
2011-12-02T13:30:00.000Z	ikonia	Newb	the info is waiting for you, have a read through the links ubottu just sent you,
