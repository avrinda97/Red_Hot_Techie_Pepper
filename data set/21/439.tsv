2011-12-15T22:49:00.000Z	VitaminE	pfifo	, that will make a usb live instead of really installing it?
2011-12-15T22:50:00.000Z	pfifo	VitaminE	it makes a LiveUSB image, and stores all the changes you make on a partition.
2011-12-15T22:52:00.000Z	VitaminE	pfifo	, is there a difference between making this from really installing it?
2011-12-15T22:53:00.000Z	pfifo	VitaminE	well it depends on what your doing with the OS, for day to day web browsing, office, image editing... its the way to go. If you setting up for doing package management ubuntu-dev then you might want an install
2011-12-15T22:55:00.000Z	pfifo	VitaminE	it saves a large amount of disk space, and its easier todo
