2006-04-17T13:09:00.000Z	xbox_sky		Hi! I'm not in the best mood... for some *ret* reason I can't view/open/extract 2 tar/gzip files, I had em stored on another hdd, and a few minutes ago I ftp'd files - to my primary pc hdd, I can't view/extract/open the tars "an error occured" , any suggestions?
2006-04-17T13:09:00.000Z	xbox_sky		is this a problem related to "ubuntu"?
2006-04-17T13:09:00.000Z	xbox_sky		bug?
2006-04-17T13:10:00.000Z	xbox_sky		First I tried to view/extract/open them with my GUI (KDE) and it took several minutes until ark finally gave up by telling me "unknown error occured"
2006-04-17T13:11:00.000Z	xbox_sky		you mean like sudo tar xvz ?
2006-04-17T13:12:00.000Z	xbox_sky		Hexic.tar.gz (trying with ark GUI - kde) nothing happens for a few minutes which is weird, then ark pops up "An error occurred while trying to open the archive "
2006-04-17T13:13:00.000Z	xbox_sky		i've tried to tar extract them in console mode, nothign happens
2006-04-17T13:15:00.000Z	xbox_sky		gzip: Hexic.tar.gz: not in gzip format
2006-04-17T13:15:00.000Z	roryy	xbox_sky	how did you transfer the file? command-line ftp client?
2006-04-17T13:15:00.000Z	xbox_sky		no a GUI ftp - gftp
2006-04-17T13:16:00.000Z	xbox_sky		evry other file works, except these 2 big tar files
2006-04-17T13:16:00.000Z	roryy	xbox_sky	did these other files include smaller tar.gz files ?
2006-04-17T13:16:00.000Z	xbox_sky		both of them are in x.tar.gz
2006-04-17T13:17:00.000Z	xbox_sky		rory, my other hdd had 3 folders with several tar files  and 2 big tar files outside the folder location
2006-04-17T13:17:00.000Z	roryy	xbox_sky	i'd suggest try transferring the files again
2006-04-17T13:18:00.000Z	xbox_sky		ok
2006-04-17T13:18:00.000Z	roryy	xbox_sky	are both machines running ubuntu?
2006-04-17T13:19:00.000Z	xbox_sky		rory the other hdd was an external one, no os specified
2006-04-17T13:19:00.000Z	xbox_sky		20 seconds remaining until first tar is on my pc hdd
2006-04-17T13:19:00.000Z	roryy	xbox_sky	but you ftp'ed to a computer ... ?
2006-04-17T13:20:00.000Z	xbox_sky	roryy	yeah sort of, but nvm that, trust me this "hdd" can store different files despite os restrictions
