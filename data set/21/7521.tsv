2006-09-11T10:54:00.000Z	_Zambezi		When I try to download files in Links (textmode) I get permission denied. Can anyone help me with it?
2006-09-11T10:55:00.000Z	ladydoor	_Zambezi	what dir did you start links in?
2006-09-11T10:56:00.000Z	_Zambezi	ladydoor	"/home/dator/files"
2006-09-11T10:57:00.000Z	ladydoor	_Zambezi	ok...maybe check who owns ~/files. in a terminal do ls -l /home/dator/
2006-09-11T10:58:00.000Z	ladydoor	_Zambezi	actually do ls -l /home/dator | grep files and then see who owns it
2006-09-11T10:59:00.000Z	_Zambezi	ladydoor	The files is owned by me and not root.
2006-09-11T10:59:00.000Z	ladydoor	_Zambezi	ok, how about this. do you know the full address of the file you're trying to download, and do you have wget or curl installed?
2006-09-11T11:00:00.000Z	_Zambezi	ladydoor	I need to download the file in Links.
2006-09-11T11:01:00.000Z	ladydoor	_Zambezi	may i ask why?
2006-09-11T11:02:00.000Z	_Zambezi	ladydoor	It's complicated. I prefer not to explain. I tried to run Links with sudo, but that didn't work either. It's still "Permission denied".
2006-09-11T11:03:00.000Z	ladydoor	_Zambezi	ok...is that the full error, and are you stuck in CLI?
2006-09-11T11:04:00.000Z	_Zambezi	ladydoor	CLI is?
2006-09-11T11:04:00.000Z	ladydoor	_Zambezi	no graphiks
2006-09-11T11:04:00.000Z	ladydoor	_Zambezi	(no X)
2006-09-11T11:05:00.000Z	_Zambezi	ladydoor	Yes. It's no X-server and I don't want a X-server. :-)
2006-09-11T11:07:00.000Z	ladydoor	_Zambezi	sweet. errr, are you aware of GNU screen (best option) and of pressing alt+Fsomenumber to switch TTYs?
2006-09-11T11:09:00.000Z	_Zambezi	ladydoor	I use that. It's great.
2006-09-11T11:09:00.000Z	ladydoor	_Zambezi	totally :-). i just ask because it has copy/paste ability, and i figured another program could help. but i guess not. sorry
2006-09-11T11:11:00.000Z	_Zambezi	ladydoor	But that doesn't help the fact that permission is denied. The folder is owned by me (by dator) and it should work.
2006-09-11T11:13:00.000Z	ladydoor	_Zambezi	good point. what about the permissions? do ls -l again, and see if it has write permission (that'll be in the mess at the front)
2006-09-11T11:14:00.000Z	_Zambezi	ladydoor	It has permission, that's why it's so strange.
