2011-07-16T16:42:00.000Z	theToff		Hey, I have a Toshiba Satellite L305-S5921, and have Natty installed... and I just had a very messed up system failure.... my laptop just overheated with no apparent cause...
2011-07-16T16:43:00.000Z	theToff		I opened it up, checked all the cables, and everything seemed in order, the fan is running properly, etc...
2011-07-16T16:44:00.000Z	theToff		Any ideas as to what might have caused the issue?
2011-07-16T16:44:00.000Z	theToff		Not at all, actually, and then twice this morning alone.
2011-07-16T16:44:00.000Z	coz_	theToff	 you may want to test the hard drive temps
2011-07-16T16:45:00.000Z	coz_	theToff	 sudo apt-get install  hddtemp
2011-07-16T16:45:00.000Z	coz_	theToff	 it doens have to be started at boot so ignor that prompt
2011-07-16T16:45:00.000Z	theToff	coz_	I'll check that out.
2011-07-16T16:45:00.000Z	coz_	theToff	 if you want to test temps in   celcius   the command is   sudo hddtemp /dev/sd*   i fyou want farenheit it is  sudo  hddtemp --u=F  /dev/sd*
2011-07-16T16:48:00.000Z	theToff	coz_	I ran said prog.... 102F is my current reading
2011-07-16T16:48:00.000Z	coz_	theToff	 whoa ,, that's way too hot
2011-07-16T16:48:00.000Z	coz_	theToff	 80 F  or  83 F should be the ceiling
2011-07-16T16:49:00.000Z	coz_	theToff	  shut it down,, let it cool off ,, then restart and see if the temps increase again
2011-07-16T16:49:00.000Z	coz_	theToff	 if it gets beyong 90 F  shut it down again
2011-07-16T16:50:00.000Z	coz_	theToff	 otherwise you will get termal damage and the drive will fall into read only mode
2011-07-16T16:55:00.000Z	coz_	theToff	 still too hot
2011-07-16T16:55:00.000Z	coz_	theToff	 for a video card that is reasonable temp not for hard drives
2011-07-16T16:56:00.000Z	coz_	theToff	 you dont want to drive to get too much termal damage,, as i said it will fall into read only mode then you could be looking at a new hard drive
2011-07-16T16:56:00.000Z	coz_	theToff	 terminal damage makes a drive unreliable
2011-07-16T16:57:00.000Z	coz_	theToff	 another thing to try is install an earlier version of ubuntu ,, see if the temps continue to rise
2011-07-16T16:58:00.000Z	coz_	theToff	  however here,, 11.04.. the only thing I noticed is increase in ram useage not much in temps of hard drive or video card
