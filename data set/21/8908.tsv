2005-12-18T09:43:00.000Z	Goldfish		This is fun. I really GNOME. I have been using KDE on my two other Debian machines, but the windows management on GNOME is cool.
2005-12-18T09:44:00.000Z	Goldfish		linuxn00b: It has been my experiment that leaving Windows requires a little dose of reality. You have to start learning stuff for yourself, not being dependent on M$ "helping you" anymore. But with that comes some remarkable feeling of liberation. My $0.02.

2005-12-18T09:46:00.000Z	Goldfish		linuxn00b: That is why I kept dual boot on my machine for so long, and also was tinkering with wine. My finally task will be to use turbotax.com this year, so that I don't need to buy a windows-based tax software package.
2005-12-18T09:46:00.000Z	Goldfish		linuxn00b: Should that prove successful, I will have eliminated the last reason to keep my dual boot partition around, and time to free up some wanting disk space.
