2007-01-10T12:03:00.000Z	Enverex		Are there any big repos other than the ones selectable by default in Edgy?
2007-01-10T12:04:00.000Z	mnoir	Enverex	you mean ones that we know will work for you or just big
2007-01-10T12:04:00.000Z	Enverex	mnoir	both really, "dangerous" ones are ok for apps that aren't system critical dependencies
2007-01-11T13:21:00.000Z	mnoir	Enverex	i mean with all the stuff ya can put in
2007-01-11T13:08:00.000Z	mnoir	Enverex	there is a page somewhere, sec
2007-01-11T13:09:00.000Z	mnoir	Enverex	if you google 'color prompt bash' you will get lots of links for cool prompt stuff
2007-01-11T13:10:00.000Z	Enverex	mnoir	thanks
2007-01-11T13:11:00.000Z	mnoir	Enverex	write an ubuntu howto when you get back - pass on the gift
2007-01-11T13:21:00.000Z	Enverex	mnoir	erm, this is pretty much the same as before, but just in colour now so it's easier to spot
2007-01-11T13:20:00.000Z	Enverex	mnoir	yay, pretty prompt, heh, thanks
2007-01-11T13:20:00.000Z	mnoir	Enverex	:)
2007-01-11T13:20:00.000Z	mnoir	Enverex	there is the hazard of making a prompt that takes 5 lines :)
2007-01-11T13:22:00.000Z	mnoir	Enverex	i have all the color stuff enables so grep hilights, vi highlights and every other pgm that knows color highlights.  i consider that and the programmable auto-complete to be the best things that ever happened to the commandline
2007-01-13T17:16:00.000Z	mnoir	Enverex	me too :)
2007-01-13T17:08:00.000Z	mnoir	Enverex	do you know what integration testing is?  how can the OO ppl test the integration in every distribution?
2007-01-13T17:09:00.000Z	mnoir	Enverex	ubuntu is a production system, not a leading edge one - any change to any code is a retest
2007-01-13T17:09:00.000Z	Enverex	mnoir	True, I just thought with packages being "fixed" so to speak there is less to go wrong than on a compile based system
2007-01-13T17:10:00.000Z	mnoir	Enverex	i don't see what the difference is, with a robust build system delivering source is pretty much the same as delivering executables.  it all still needs testing appropriate to the user base
2007-01-13T17:11:00.000Z	mnoir	Enverex	:))))
2007-01-13T17:15:00.000Z	mnoir	Enverex	your first sentence puts you in a paradox - reliable and new are usually mutually exclusive :)
2007-01-13T17:16:00.000Z	Enverex	mnoir	I guess that's why I liked Gentoo... when it actually worked, but the compile times and breakages eventually wore me down.
