2009-06-10T20:02:00.000Z	pantcho		i am now after a fresh install of version 9
2009-06-10T20:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pantcho	you want to clean install?
2009-06-10T20:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pantcho	ok I read it wrong
2009-06-10T20:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pantcho	yes your nearly fresh install of 9.04
2009-06-10T20:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pantcho	it's ok,  I helped a guy the other day, and when I didn't guide him on the install, because he hadn't got back to me,   he ended up installing Ubuntu on really smalll partitions
2009-06-10T20:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pantcho	your on Ubuntu now?
2009-06-10T20:06:00.000Z	pantcho	sebsebseb	thing is i got winXP on this PC and i loaded the boot cd and then install it without format like when now i boot i got 2 oses choices, ubuntu and XP. yes i am on ubuntu with pidgin
2009-06-10T20:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pantcho	did you do a partition install?
2009-06-10T20:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pantcho	or did you install inside WIndows with Wubi?
2009-06-10T20:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pantcho	did you boot from the CD and install?  if so yes you got partitions
2009-06-10T20:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pantcho	ok  lt's find out
2009-06-10T20:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pantcho	df -h and pastebin the output
2009-06-10T20:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pantcho	would be  something if  Ubuntu came with gparted the partition editor, or a graphical  partition showing program, but nope
2009-06-10T20:09:00.000Z	pantcho	sebsebseb	http://paste.ubuntu.com/192668/
2009-06-10T20:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pantcho	yep like the other guy
2009-06-10T20:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pantcho	,because you didn't have  enough unallocated space I expect
2009-06-10T20:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pantcho	open  applications > assesories > disk usage analyser
2009-06-10T20:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pantcho	what does that look like :d
2009-06-10T20:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pantcho	well if you don't like GUI, I can think of  other distros  that are a lot more commandline than Ubuntu
2009-06-10T20:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	pantcho	I think  re install and set up  the partitions yourself, more control that way
