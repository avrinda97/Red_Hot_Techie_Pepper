2008-04-25T03:32:00.000Z	laeg		i am installing ubuntu from the 7.04 live cd and i want to leave a partition untouched by the installer
2008-04-25T03:32:00.000Z	RyanPrior	laeg	If you don't specify for the live CD installer to format a partition, it shouldn't touch it.
2008-04-25T03:32:00.000Z	laeg	RyanPrior	i got this WARNING: This will destroy all data on any partitions you have removed as
2008-04-25T03:33:00.000Z	RyanPrior	laeg	It will destroy data **on partitions you've removed or marked to be formatted** -- that means ones you haven't removed, or marked to format, will not be deleted.
2008-04-25T03:34:00.000Z	laeg	RyanPrior	define 'removed'. i have a apartition i didn't touch in the installer but there is an option where you set / and /home to instead set 'don'tuse'
2008-04-25T03:35:00.000Z	RyanPrior	laeg	I don't think that setting something to "don't use" means "remove this partition". Removing a partition would be, for example, deleting your Windows partition to make more room for Ubuntu.
2008-04-25T03:35:00.000Z	laeg	RyanPrior	i didn't set it to don't use, i didn't set it to anything, should i?
2008-04-25T03:36:00.000Z	RyanPrior	laeg	I think it should only use a partition if you tell it to do so.
2008-04-25T03:36:00.000Z	laeg	RyanPrior	i have 4 parts on the drive, linux swap, / and /home, and one i am just temp storing files - i did not go near that part in the install
2008-04-25T03:37:00.000Z	laeg	RyanPrior	ty
2008-04-25T03:37:00.000Z	RyanPrior	laeg	Just read carefully and you should be good. It's difficult for me to say anything for sure because I don't have the installer in front of me.
2008-04-25T03:37:00.000Z	RyanPrior	laeg	If you want extra peace of mind, screenshot it and I'll take a look. :-)
2008-04-25T03:51:00.000Z	laeg	RyanPrior	i'm just not confident continuing with the warning WARNING: This will destroy all data on any partitions you have removed as
2008-04-25T03:52:00.000Z	RyanPrior	laeg	The thing is, the warning is true and it means exactly what it says.
2008-04-25T03:53:00.000Z	RyanPrior	laeg	It will give you that warning no matter what you do, because it needs to format at least a few parititions to install.
2008-04-25T03:53:00.000Z	laeg	RyanPrior	it could mean *all data, which includes my storage partition
2008-04-25T03:53:00.000Z	RyanPrior	laeg	The warning is to make you think carefully about which parititions you chose to format.
2008-04-25T03:54:00.000Z	laeg	RyanPrior	ok, lets see what happens
2008-05-14T11:12:00.000Z	RyanPrior	laeg	You might be interested in using the Disk Usage Analyzer.
2008-05-14T11:14:00.000Z	laeg	RyanPrior	thanks that's a nice program. i'm trying to get accustomed to term commands
2008-05-14T11:14:00.000Z	RyanPrior	laeg	Ah, in that case df is very nice.
