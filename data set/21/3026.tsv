2009-05-01T02:00:00.000Z	Ghoti	gartral	wow, when they say EOL, they *mean* it, huh?
2009-08-11T07:42:00.000Z	Ghoti	gartral	perhaps the filesystem is mounted read-only?
2009-08-11T07:43:00.000Z	Ghoti	gartral	could you pastebin the output of 'mount' please?
2009-08-11T07:43:00.000Z	gartral	Ghoti	ok, but im telling you, this drive isnt showing up
2009-08-11T07:44:00.000Z	gartral	Ghoti	http://gar.pastebin.com/f7941d17
2009-08-11T07:45:00.000Z	Ghoti	gartral	okay, how about this:  sudo fdisk -l
2009-08-11T07:45:00.000Z	Ghoti	gartral	does the drive show up in that output?
2009-08-11T07:51:00.000Z	gartral	Ghoti	no, it does not, untill i reinsert it
2009-08-11T07:53:00.000Z	gartral	Ghoti	ok, now that i reinserted it, it *does* come up an *i* flagged as rw
2009-08-11T07:53:00.000Z	Ghoti	gartral	now that it's rw, can you write to the drive?
2009-08-11T07:54:00.000Z	gartral	Ghoti	no.. it "dissappears" again
2009-08-11T07:54:00.000Z	Ghoti	gartral	Drat.
2009-08-11T07:54:00.000Z	gartral	Ghoti	it was always rw... but it does this same thing on linux mac and windows
2009-08-11T07:58:00.000Z	gartral	Ghoti	/dev/sdb1 on /media/BETHDRIVE type vfat (rw,nosuid,nodev,uhelper=hal,shortname=mixed,uid=1000,utf8,umask=077,flush) that line disturbs me for some reason
2009-08-11T07:58:00.000Z	Ghoti	gartral	that looks normal to me
2009-08-11T07:59:00.000Z	gartral	Ghoti	ok, anything else you can think of?
2009-08-11T07:59:00.000Z	Ghoti	gartral	sorry, not off the top of my head :(
2009-08-11T08:00:00.000Z	Ghoti	gartral	 fsck?
2009-08-11T08:00:00.000Z	gartral	Ghoti	fsck hangs
