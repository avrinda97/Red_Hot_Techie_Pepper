2008-07-17T10:47:00.000Z	ffiarpg		I am trying to get my E 295c Gateway Tablet PC pen working in Ubuntu 8.04 and after following a guide on the forums, nothing has changed. If anyone uses this same model of tablet or a similar one and can successfully use their pen to write, draw and take notes, I would really appreciate some assistance.

2008-07-17T10:49:00.000Z	pvl1	ffiarpg	have u restarted the xserver?
2008-07-17T10:50:00.000Z	ffiarpg	pvl1	i restarted the computer, that restarts the xserver as well yes?
2008-07-17T10:50:00.000Z	pvl1	ffiarpg	yes samething, you say it doesnt work at all
2008-07-17T10:51:00.000Z	ffiarpg	pvl1	yeah, nothing seems different from when i started following the guide to now
2008-07-17T10:55:00.000Z	pvl1	ffiarpg	unplug the tablet, plug it back in and type dmesg in the terminal
2008-07-17T10:55:00.000Z	ffiarpg	pvl1	sorry maybe I was unclear, it is a tablet pc
2008-07-17T10:56:00.000Z	ffiarpg	pvl1	as in, the writing surface is the screen itself
2008-07-17T10:56:00.000Z	pvl1	ffiarpg	oh its an actual tablet pc hold on a sec then
2008-07-17T10:56:00.000Z	pvl1	ffiarpg	er what kind is it?
2008-07-17T10:57:00.000Z	ffiarpg	pvl1	it is a e-295c, it is also called a c-140x, the first being the business model and the second being the consumer, exact same pc though
2008-07-17T10:58:00.000Z	pvl1	ffiarpg	can you pastebin your xorg.conf?
2008-07-17T11:00:00.000Z	ffiarpg	pvl1	i think this is right http://pastebin.com/m37eeaec it also includes additional information that the forum post said to include when asking others for help
2008-07-17T11:05:00.000Z	pvl1	ffiarpg	i think you should try configuring mouse device, as the stylus kinda thing. is that what you were essentially trying to do?
2008-07-17T11:06:00.000Z	ffiarpg	pvl1	i think so, i am trying to get ubuntu to recognise my tablet pen and allow me to write and draw with it, as well as use it instead of a mouse
2008-07-17T11:08:00.000Z	ffiarpg	pvl1	this looks like it may work for me, thanks a lot, i appreciate the help, ill give this a try
2008-07-17T11:09:00.000Z	pvl1	ffiarpg	oh, well good luck, but i think that you literally have to make the mouse device be a stylus. also if you downoad files/drivers i think that xorg need to read them in the files section
2008-07-17T11:11:00.000Z	ffiarpg	pvl1	yeah this does seem like it will be fairly complicated, i may just have to find someone who has the same os and same computer as me, there is a youtube video demonstrating it so i know it can be done, ill see what i can do
2008-07-17T11:12:00.000Z	pvl1	ffiarpg	look up xorg guides, so maybne u can figured out what to do on ur own
