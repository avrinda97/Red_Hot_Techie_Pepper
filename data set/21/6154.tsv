2009-06-05T23:08:00.000Z	Nationiant		how you compile source code?
2009-06-05T23:09:00.000Z	Nationiant		gcc?
2009-06-05T23:09:00.000Z	Nationiant		oh
2009-06-05T23:09:00.000Z	Nationiant		:)
2009-06-05T23:10:00.000Z	Nationiant		And hey
2009-06-05T23:10:00.000Z	Nationiant		How can you add the "Locations" or "Places" wtf is it on English, to the panel?
2009-06-05T23:12:00.000Z	Nationiant		I mean, I have a custom panel, I deleted the old one, but I want the "Places" on the panel
2009-06-05T23:12:00.000Z	Nationiant		nope
2009-06-05T23:12:00.000Z	Nationiant		don't
2009-06-05T23:13:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	Nationiant	don't think you can add just places to the panel
2009-06-05T23:33:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	Nationiant	if what i think is riht, it's either applications, places, system, or none, but could be mistaken though
2009-06-05T23:34:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	Nationiant	like i said, don't think it is possible, unless you reate your own applet
2009-06-05T23:35:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	Nationiant	you still have to work with the applets present in ubuntu right?
2009-06-05T23:37:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	Nationiant	you can add applets and launchers to your panel, unless your programming skills are high enough to program your own applet, what you want is not possible
2009-06-05T23:38:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	Nationiant	or ask the ubuntu guys to create that applet in the next release
2009-06-05T23:39:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	Nationiant	as a launcher, yes you can
2009-06-05T23:40:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	Nationiant	create a launcher for "nautilus /home/user"
2009-06-05T23:43:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	Nationiant	right click on your panel > add to panel > custom application launcher
2009-06-05T23:44:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	Nationiant	"nautilus /home/user" should be the command, choose a name for it, a description and a nice icon and you're done
2009-06-05T23:44:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	Nationiant	isn't exactly what you want, but does the trick
