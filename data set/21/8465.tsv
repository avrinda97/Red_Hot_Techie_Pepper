2008-02-18T14:00:00.000Z	danny	Trel	did u get that?
2008-02-18T14:01:00.000Z	Trel		I did at that
2008-02-18T14:01:00.000Z	danny	Trel	thanks. So do you have a better understandding of what I want to do?
2008-02-18T14:01:00.000Z	Trel		Yes, but I'm not quite sure how to go about getting that done.
2008-02-18T14:03:00.000Z	danny	Trel	that's not a problem. But do you have any suggestions as to how i would go about asking about it in a way that others would understand better?
2008-02-18T14:06:00.000Z	Trel	danny	I believe you've explained it fairly well. I would try searching Google for a method of editing buttons in GNOME.

2008-02-18T14:09:00.000Z	danny	Trel	one more thing. I noticed that my mouse is like more slidy (lol) on Linux but it seems to be more solid as if i have more control in Windows. Any idea what settings to change?
