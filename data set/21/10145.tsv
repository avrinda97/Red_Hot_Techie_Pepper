2006-10-06T16:30:00.000Z	treitter		does the 6.06.1 Alternate install CD have bash?
2006-10-06T16:31:00.000Z	Dr_willis	treitter	 i  would hope so. :P
2006-10-06T16:31:00.000Z	treitter	Dr_willis	I can't seem to find it, for some reason..
2006-10-06T16:32:00.000Z	Dr_willis	treitter	 hmmm.. find it how/where? im trying to think of any linux disrto that dont come with bash. :P
2006-10-06T16:32:00.000Z	treitter	Dr_willis	well, it's not in my PATH (nor in /bin, where I would expect it)
2006-10-06T16:33:00.000Z	Dr_willis		~$ which bash
2006-10-06T16:33:00.000Z	Dr_willis		/bin/bash
2006-10-06T16:33:00.000Z	treitter	Dr_willis	hah.. "which" isn't found, either
2006-10-06T16:34:00.000Z	Dr_willis	treitter	 hmmmmm...  how did you install this system. heh.
2006-10-06T16:34:00.000Z	Dr_willis	treitter	 better yet.. how did it even boot...
2006-10-06T16:34:00.000Z	treitter	Dr_willis	no, this is booted off of the Alternate CD
2006-10-06T16:34:00.000Z	treitter		I'm still surprised that I can't find it..
2006-10-06T16:35:00.000Z	treitter		I foudn the package, but that doesn't help much
2006-10-06T16:35:00.000Z	Dr_willis	treitter	 you mean you are on the alternate install cd, in the installer? or livecd? or what..
2006-10-06T16:35:00.000Z	treitter	Dr_willis	the alternate install CD
2006-10-06T16:38:00.000Z	Dr_willis	treitter	 it may be using busybox for that stuff...
2006-10-06T16:38:00.000Z	Dr_willis	treitter	 but that seems weird
2006-10-06T16:53:00.000Z	treitter	Dr_willis	yeah, it looks like the Alternate installer doesn't include bash
2006-10-06T16:53:00.000Z	treitter	Dr_willis	but the regular LiveCD does, so I'm fine
2006-10-06T16:53:00.000Z	Dr_willis	treitter	 thats weird... it must be using busybox is my guess
2006-10-06T16:54:00.000Z	treitter	Dr_willis	yeah. And its built-in ash and sh don't play nicely with bash scripts :)
