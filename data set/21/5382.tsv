2007-11-06T13:39:00.000Z	inversekinetix	Cypher	emerald just gives you annoying window frames
2007-11-06T13:41:00.000Z	inversekinetix	Cypher	do it through synaptic
2007-11-06T13:43:00.000Z	Cypher	inversekinetix	does Emerald go along with Compiz Fusion or do you have to use one or the other?
2007-11-06T13:43:00.000Z	inversekinetix	Cypher	Im using it now, theres only one theme I have that I like,
2007-11-06T13:44:00.000Z	inversekinetix	Cypher	Yes. compiz is a window manager and emerald is a window decorator ( i think theyre the right terms)
2007-11-06T13:45:00.000Z	inversekinetix	Cypher	after you install Emerald youll get a control panel in SYSTEM　＞＞＞PREFERENCES
2007-11-06T13:45:00.000Z	inversekinetix	Cypher	what isnt working?
2007-11-06T13:47:00.000Z	inversekinetix	Cypher	did you restart after installing it?
2007-11-06T13:47:00.000Z	inversekinetix	Cypher	double click on the theme and it should apply it, i had to restart to get it to work
2007-11-06T13:48:00.000Z	inversekinetix	Cypher	it should just apply it
2007-11-06T13:50:00.000Z	inversekinetix	Cypher	I dont know, will they still work?
2007-11-06T13:52:00.000Z	inversekinetix	Cypher	I just use high resolution pictures for my skydome
2007-11-06T13:53:00.000Z	inversekinetix	Cypher	just click the "animate" button
2007-11-06T13:54:00.000Z	inversekinetix	Cypher	try to find some 360 degree panaramas
2007-11-06T13:56:00.000Z	inversekinetix	Cypher	do a google search for "panorama"  there are loads of massive ones
2007-11-06T14:00:00.000Z	inversekinetix	Cypher	np, if you get ones that are a bit taller than the height of your desktop and animate it, it will look cool
