2009-06-06T07:18:00.000Z	Acorn		I just installed a java webstart program, how to I make it appear on my applications menu? (it made a .desktop file on my desktop)
2009-06-06T07:20:00.000Z	fccf	Acorn	goto system >prefrences>main menu - add from there
2009-06-06T07:22:00.000Z	Acorn	fccf	thank you
2009-06-06T07:24:00.000Z	Acorn	fccf	how do I find where the program is installed so I can add it to the menu?
2009-06-06T07:25:00.000Z	fccf	Acorn	rightclick on .desktop file to see properties
2009-06-06T07:25:00.000Z	fccf	Acorn	what are you trying to run?
2009-06-06T07:26:00.000Z	Acorn	fccf	I added the .desktop file to the menu, but thought I could then delete it, turns out you can't
2009-06-06T07:26:00.000Z	Acorn	fccf	the program is Cgoban3
2009-06-06T07:28:00.000Z	fccf	Acorn	you can uncheck an item but you cannot remove it - use new item fill out name and command with cgoban3 to add new item
2009-06-06T07:29:00.000Z	Acorn	fccf	How do I know what command to put?
2009-06-06T07:30:00.000Z	fccf	Acorn	if you look at the .desktop files properties you will see the command
2009-06-06T07:30:00.000Z	Acorn	fccf	I deleted the file :(
2009-06-06T07:31:00.000Z	fccf	Acorn	how did you install it -- cgoban or cgoban3?
2009-06-06T07:32:00.000Z	Acorn	fccf	I downloaded the java web start program from gokgs.com. I then ran that program and it installed itself, making the .desktop file on the desktop which I deleted
2009-06-06T07:32:00.000Z	Acorn	fccf	Cgoban 3
2009-06-06T07:33:00.000Z	fccf	Acorn	you might need to run it from inside a java console
2009-06-06T07:33:00.000Z	Acorn	fccf	run what?
2009-06-06T07:35:00.000Z	fccf	Acorn	 sounds like what you are trying to run is a java application, it isn;t going to operate the same as a ubuntu program - what does it do?
2009-06-06T07:36:00.000Z	Acorn	fccf	It's a client for playing Go. I'll try doing "javaws http://files.gokgs.com/javaBin/cgoban.jnlp" to install it again and see what happens, I'm sure it wont install the files twice
2009-06-06T07:39:00.000Z	fccf	Acorn	the client runs in java web start
2009-06-06T07:49:00.000Z	fccf	Acorn	try downloading the .jnlp file and running javawm filename.jlnp
