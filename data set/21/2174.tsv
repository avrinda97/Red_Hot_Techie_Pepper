2012-09-03T13:25:00.000Z	AdvoWork		i'm trying to get internet working on an old installation of Ubuntu(it needs to be old for a migration). lspci says: Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation: Unknown device 10c0 (rev 02)  how can I install that driver or get it working?
2012-09-03T13:27:00.000Z	Atlantic777	AdvoWork	the driver is in kernel and I would not recommend you to compile kernel by yourself if you aren't experienced user. Can you post ID of that device which lspci is reported?
2012-09-03T13:28:00.000Z	Atlantic777	AdvoWork	try this site, too. It's probably good point to start with. http://kmuto.jp/debian/hcl/
2012-09-03T13:28:00.000Z	AdvoWork	Atlantic777	the id(i think thats what you want) is: 0000:00:19.0 ?
2012-09-03T13:30:00.000Z	AdvoWork	Atlantic777	this is for ubuntu 6.06 (i know v.v old) but I need to be able to get the internet working on it
2012-09-03T13:31:00.000Z	Atlantic777	AdvoWork	that makes sense. :D Ubuntu 6.06 uses old kernel which probably doesn't have the driver you need. Why do you need working internet connection in it?
2012-09-03T13:31:00.000Z	AdvoWork	Atlantic777	I need to do a migration, and install some software, that only works with active connections, any suggestions
2012-09-03T13:31:00.000Z	Atlantic777	AdvoWork	wouldn't booting live session and connecting to internet help?
2012-09-03T13:32:00.000Z	AdvoWork	Atlantic777	i'd need a normal session to be able to do further installations of software?
2012-09-03T13:32:00.000Z	Atlantic777	AdvoWork	you can install software in live session, too. It's just not permanent (if you are booting from CD)
2012-09-03T13:33:00.000Z	AdvoWork	Atlantic777	the upgrade/backup/restore takes 16+ hours though, so my worry is live session failing = a lot of lost work. Is there any other ways to get the driver installed?
2012-09-03T13:34:00.000Z	Atlantic777	AdvoWork	actually, you may compile that module for your kernel, but it probably wouldn't go as easy as you and me want.
2012-09-03T13:34:00.000Z	Atlantic777	AdvoWork	another reasonable thing I would consider is buying an cheap network interface controler. :)
2012-09-03T13:37:00.000Z	AdvoWork	Atlantic777	any instructions for compiling the kernel with that correct driver?
2012-09-03T13:40:00.000Z	Atlantic777	AdvoWork	yes... don't do it. :D You need to find out correct name of driver you need, get source code, prepare build environment, make those .ko files, modprobe it and hope it will work. I would ask on linux kernel mailing list, too (LKML). Can you boot some live session and check which driver is needed for that ethernet card with "lspci -knn | grep -i ether -A 3"
2012-09-03T13:55:00.000Z	AdvoWork	Atlantic777	can i use any live cd, or does it have to be an old version of ubuntu im using?
2012-09-03T13:56:00.000Z	Atlantic777	AdvoWork	try with new and see if there is driver you need, which driver you need and then we can look how to get it on 6.06
2012-09-03T14:13:00.000Z	AdvoWork	Atlantic777	finally got a live cd booted. It lists a few different entries, is there anything specific you need to know from me?
2012-09-03T14:13:00.000Z	Atlantic777	AdvoWork	yes, the most important... is your network card working with newer ubuntu?
2012-09-03T14:20:00.000Z	AdvoWork	Atlantic777	doesn't appear to be yet
2012-09-03T15:14:00.000Z	AdvoWork	Atlantic777	any further ideas?
