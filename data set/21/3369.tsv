2009-02-24T06:48:00.000Z	kinja-sheep		How do I upgrade from Ubuntu to Jaunty Alpha4?  The sub-notebook doesn't have working Wifi but the documentary said Jaunty kernel --> confirmed working wifi.
2009-02-24T06:48:00.000Z	Huufarted	kinja-sheep	what is your wireless chipset?
2009-02-24T06:48:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Huufarted	I don't know.  I have Aspire One.
2009-02-24T06:49:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Huufarted	Okay.  Thank you. :)
2009-02-24T06:54:00.000Z	Huufarted	kinja-sheep	what you need are the ath5k drivers.
2009-02-24T06:54:00.000Z	Huufarted	kinja-sheep	I am getting you the link now
2009-02-24T06:56:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Huufarted	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AspireOne (Under Wireless Modules?)
2009-02-24T06:57:00.000Z	Huufarted	kinja-sheep	that's the one.  I use the wireless a lot streaming HD videos and if that's not considered heavy traffic, then I don't know what is
2009-02-24T06:57:00.000Z	Huufarted	kinja-sheep	I am getting you the good link for the download now.
2009-02-24T06:58:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Huufarted	I tried this before. It didn't work.  And it happens to mess up the wired networking too.  I have to resort back to linux-general-driver-9 (the older one). I don't know how I can go back to 11.  I purged it and reinstall it but it's still same.
2009-02-24T06:58:00.000Z	Huufarted	kinja-sheep	the one you're talking about isn't the link that I'm finding
2009-02-24T06:59:00.000Z	Huufarted	kinja-sheep	give me a few and try this, but let me get this link.
2009-02-24T06:59:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Huufarted	Okay.
2009-02-24T07:05:00.000Z	Huufarted	kinja-sheep	check this out:  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=964836
2009-02-24T07:05:00.000Z	Huufarted	kinja-sheep	Download the ath5k drivers and follow that 4-line install procedure.  Once you restart your PC afterwards (can probably just log out/in, but I'd reboot) you should have your wireless up and running
2009-02-24T07:06:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Huufarted	Okay.  I'll try it.  I'll let you know. :)
2009-02-24T07:07:00.000Z	Huufarted	kinja-sheep	I have the same wireless chipset and it ran like a charm for me
2009-02-24T07:33:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Huufarted	It's not working.  Does the Wifi LED blinks for you?
2009-02-24T07:34:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Huufarted	Bbl.
2009-02-24T08:35:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Huufarted	A little update for you.  It worked.  Apparently I still need to dumb down to linux-kernel-9. Is there a way to resort back to linux-kernel-11?  Purging + install doesn't cut it for me.
2009-02-24T08:36:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Huufarted	Otherwise, I'm fine with it, really.  We all love to be on cutting edge.  It bleed so good. :3
