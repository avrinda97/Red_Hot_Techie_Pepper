2007-08-10T16:31:00.000Z	sunnypies		anyone, I have a ubuntu desktop with apache web server, however it seems like its blocking when i try to access from a different comptuer
2007-08-10T16:31:00.000Z	sunnypies		anyone know?
2007-08-10T16:31:00.000Z	MenZa	sunnypies	it sounds like a bad config; is it apache2?
2007-08-10T16:32:00.000Z	sunnypies	MenZa	yes
2007-08-10T16:32:00.000Z	sunnypies	MenZa	its 2.2.3
2007-08-10T16:32:00.000Z	MenZa	sunnypies	Right...
2007-08-10T16:32:00.000Z	MenZa	sunnypies	Installed from the repositories?
2007-08-10T16:32:00.000Z	sunnypies	MenZa	yes sir
2007-08-10T16:33:00.000Z	MenZa	sunnypies	the latest version is 2.2.4... Vanilla install? As in, you haven't reconfigured it, have you?
2007-08-10T16:33:00.000Z	sunnypies	MenZa	i haven't configured it,  what is vanilla?  will 2,2,4 fix the problem?
2007-08-10T16:36:00.000Z	MenZa	sunnypies	can you do cat /etc/apache2/apache2.conf | grep Listen && cat /etc/apache2/httpd.conf | grep Listen for me and paste the output?
2007-08-10T16:38:00.000Z	sunnypies	MenZa	I copied your command "cat /etc/apache2/apache2.conf | grep Listen && cat /etc/apache2/httpd.conf | grep Listen" and there was no output
2007-08-10T16:38:00.000Z	MenZa	sunnypies	No output... that sounds weird.
2007-08-10T16:39:00.000Z	MenZa	sunnypies	The Listen setting in the Apache config files specifies who to allow to connect to. It could be a router problem.
2007-08-10T16:39:00.000Z	sunnypies	MenZa	yea cus this network is at work so could it be a firewall?
2007-08-10T16:40:00.000Z	MenZa	sunnypies	It could be a router problem. You'd have to setup router forwarding for port 80 to your local machine.
2007-08-10T16:40:00.000Z	MenZa	sunnypies	Port forwarding, even
2007-08-10T16:40:00.000Z	sunnypies	MenZa	yea I bet its behind the firewall or the port isn't open, how would i open port 80?
2007-08-10T16:41:00.000Z	MenZa	sunnypies	You would have to configure your router, and with that, I'm afraid I can't help you. Find your user manual.
2007-08-10T16:41:00.000Z	sunnypies	MenZa	yea i wouldn't be able to change router at work lol
2007-08-10T16:42:00.000Z	MenZa	sunnypies	hehe :)
