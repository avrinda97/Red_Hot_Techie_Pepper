2009-11-01T00:21:00.000Z	tanath	Xgates	eper3z i'd recommend Deluge over Transmission
2009-11-01T00:22:00.000Z	Xgates	tanath	ahh didn't hear that one...
2009-11-01T00:22:00.000Z	tanath	Xgates	seems to be the best native linux torrent client.
2009-11-01T00:23:00.000Z	Xgates	tanath	actually maybe I did hear, just can't remember at the moment, but the GUI looks like I've seen it
2009-11-01T00:31:00.000Z	tanath	Xgates	not if you don't know the app
2009-11-01T00:31:00.000Z	Xgates	tanath	:)
2009-11-01T00:31:00.000Z	Xgates	tanath	well let's see you want to file a bug? Peeps filing bugs should be geek enough to know their tools, yes?  :)
2009-11-01T00:32:00.000Z	tanath	Xgates	doesn't always work like that
2009-11-01T00:32:00.000Z	tanath	Xgates	and no. not necessarily
2009-11-01T00:34:00.000Z	Xgates	tanath	I mean no offense, but newbies shouldn't be filing bugs for many reasons and the fact they can't figure out their tools to do so, proves one point, PLUS what one person sees as a bug with no experience typically ends up being user error many times, anyhow.....
2009-11-01T00:35:00.000Z	tanath	Xgates	ok, it's debatable, sure - i take your point. but there are reasons why it should not be this way. the change is ill-advised
2009-11-01T00:37:00.000Z	Xgates	tanath	oh yeah don't get me wrong the tools should possibly be made to be easier to do so, but again, people with no experience shouldn't really bother, UNLESS they know for certain it's a problem, sure sometimes a problem can be easy to tell, other times a user is messing things up and doesn't have things setup or configured properly, etc....
2009-11-01T00:37:00.000Z	tanath	Xgates	you're not thinking right... what if, for instance, your bug is in the bug reporting tool?
2009-11-01T00:38:00.000Z	tanath	Xgates	or otherwise prevents it from running?
2009-11-01T00:38:00.000Z	tanath	Xgates	it's just plain stupid
2009-11-01T00:38:00.000Z	Xgates	tanath	yeah sure, bugs in the bug tool, that's a good one, but of course I was just talking outside that, I'm sure you know... :)
2009-11-01T00:39:00.000Z	tanath	Xgates	then you missed my point
2009-11-01T00:41:00.000Z	Xgates	tanath	sorry if you were talking about a bug in the bug tool and that was your point, mine was simplying being experienced to move past that and go onto the next step if there is one and if you don't know there is, then you shouldn't be bothering, because if you don't know or can't figure it out, well don't bother....
2009-11-01T00:43:00.000Z	tanath	Xgates	my point was that you shouldn't rely on a bug tool, and force people to use it, because it can be counter-productive. it's not always even possible (like if x won't run)
2009-11-01T00:44:00.000Z	Xgates	tanath	but apport-bug is a bug tool CLI, so that was my point, don't seeing any being forced over that....
2009-11-01T00:45:00.000Z	tanath	Xgates	mm, good point. anyway, got a warning and am trying to focus on bug reporting
