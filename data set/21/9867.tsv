2005-12-14T10:23:00.000Z	bob2_		ubuntu runs fine on headless boxes
2005-12-14T10:24:00.000Z	bob2_		it's the same as ubuntu, but with xfce4.  if you don't know what it's like, try it
2005-12-14T10:24:00.000Z	bob2_		any plan that involves using gentoo for it's docuemtnation is doomed
2005-12-14T10:25:00.000Z	dabaR	bob2_	do you know why I get a error:could not open /var/run/utmp: No such process error when creating new screens in gnu screen, and as a result a small delay?
2005-12-14T10:25:00.000Z	dabaR	bob2_	or more importantly, how to fix.
2005-12-14T10:26:00.000Z	bob2_	dabaR	does it exist?
2005-12-14T10:29:00.000Z	dabaR	bob2_	the file itself exists. I tried playing with permissions, and that did not help. (in the likely case this scrolled by you, I forgot to prepend with nick.)
2005-12-14T10:29:00.000Z	bob2_	dabaR	who owns it?
2005-12-14T10:30:00.000Z	dabaR	bob2_	root. permissions are fine for owner and group. I added myself to the group(utmp) no changes.
2005-12-14T10:30:00.000Z	bob2_	dabaR	dunno then, sorry
2005-12-14T10:31:00.000Z	dabaR	bob2_	that is ok, it is just a 1 second delay -- ages
2005-12-14T10:39:00.000Z	dabaR	bob2_	we try installing apache on this ubuntu system, and we get an error, posted under hd420 on paste.ubuntulinux.nl
2005-12-14T10:39:00.000Z	bob2_	dabaR	I'd be using apache2
2005-12-14T10:40:00.000Z	bob2_	dabaR	make the second line of /var/lib/dpkg/info/apache.postinst be "set -x"
2005-12-14T10:40:00.000Z	bob2_	dabaR	then 'dpkg --confogure -a'
2005-12-14T10:40:00.000Z	dabaR	bob2_	why now that? Out of curiosity.
2005-12-14T10:41:00.000Z	bob2_	dabaR	why which bit?
2005-12-14T10:41:00.000Z	dabaR	bob2_	the change of the script.
2005-12-14T10:41:00.000Z	bob2_	dabaR	to force it to print wtf it's doing
2005-12-14T10:42:00.000Z	dabaR	bob2_	we will try apache2 first, perhaps.
2005-12-14T10:50:00.000Z	dabaR	bob2_	seveas' sourceomatic, kinda sucks.
