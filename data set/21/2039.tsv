2010-02-08T02:00:00.000Z	KaffeeJunky1231	z3r0-0n3	How is viewing your harddrive related to your encrypted home dir?
2010-02-08T02:02:00.000Z	z3r0-0n3		because every time I try to open it, it gives me a message saying "unable to mount" because "/blah/blah/sda_crypt is mounted"

2010-02-08T02:07:00.000Z	KaffeeJunky1231	z3r0-0n3	you encrypted your homdir and since you did that you're getting this error message?
2010-02-08T02:07:00.000Z	KaffeeJunky1231	z3r0-0n3	what programm did you use to encrypt your home dir?
2010-02-08T02:08:00.000Z	z3r0-0n3	KaffeeJunky1231	i encrypted my home dir when i first installed ubuntu. this is the first time im trying to open the hard drive.
2010-02-08T02:08:00.000Z	z3r0-0n3	KaffeeJunky1231	the alternative install cd
2010-02-08T02:09:00.000Z	KaffeeJunky1231	z3r0-0n3	I'm sorry I don't know what would cause such a problem

2010-02-08T02:10:00.000Z	KaffeeJunky1231	z3r0-0n3	that sounds very fishy to me, encrypting your home folder shouldn't prevent you from using your harddrive
2010-02-08T02:10:00.000Z	z3r0-0n3	KaffeeJunky1231	im not prevented from opening my hard drive, I just cant open the dir "hard drive"
