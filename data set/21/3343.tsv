2009-08-31T08:49:00.000Z	Nerd42		hi! :)
2009-08-31T08:51:00.000Z	Nerd42		hey i've got a computer with an AMD Duron processor that's 1.26 Ghz, 272 MB of RAM and a 20 GB hard drive that I'd like to put linux on so I can start learning how to use linux cause i don't know very much about it at all yet
2009-08-31T08:51:00.000Z	Nerd42		Wouldn't Xubuntu be a better choice than Ubuntu for an old system like that?
2009-08-31T08:51:00.000Z	Nerd42		or should I be using some other distro?
2009-08-31T08:51:00.000Z	linux	Nerd42	Xubuntu is a good one to choose, or you could try the alternate version of ubuntu
2009-08-31T08:52:00.000Z	Nerd42	linux	"the alternate version" ?? what's that?
2009-08-31T08:52:00.000Z	linux	Nerd42	its a text based installation of ubuntu that runs on computers with less than 256 MB of RAM
2009-08-31T08:53:00.000Z	Nerd42	linux	so basically it's just a prompt ? or by "text based" do you mean something else?
2009-08-31T08:53:00.000Z	linux	Nerd42	its text, but it has colors and is pretty easy to setup (ubuntu makes it pretty easy)
2009-08-31T08:53:00.000Z	linux		!alternate | Nerd42
2009-08-31T08:54:00.000Z	Nerd42		!minimal
2009-08-31T08:54:00.000Z	Nerd42		oh i would want the alternate CD i guess
2009-08-31T08:55:00.000Z	Nerd42	linux	OK so basically you're saying that this is just the installer that it makes faster?
2009-08-31T08:55:00.000Z	linux	Nerd42	and more reliable installation for newer linux users
2009-08-31T08:56:00.000Z	Nerd42		oh ok
2009-08-31T08:56:00.000Z	Nerd42	linux	well with those specs should i even be running xubuntu though?
2009-08-31T08:56:00.000Z	Nerd42		... ubuntu
2009-08-31T08:56:00.000Z	Nerd42		aargh
2009-08-31T08:57:00.000Z	linux	Nerd42	Yes, it shouldn't be a problem, if it is, you can sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop to switch between the two upon login
2009-08-31T08:57:00.000Z	Nerd42		well my problems not with getting the installer to run on my slow computer, it's that i want the operating system itself to not be slow
2009-08-31T08:57:00.000Z	Nerd42	linux	oh really? that's handy
