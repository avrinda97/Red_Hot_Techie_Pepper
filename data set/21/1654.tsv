2010-06-12T03:17:00.000Z	sechs		i have more problems, seing that the one with freezes will not get solved soon. I have installed pydance, and it gets an error, and dont start running. the message that appears is "sr0: CDROM not ready.  Make sure there is a disc in the drive." anyone know why?
2010-06-12T03:18:00.000Z	ubutom	sechs	you got the disc of that game?
2010-06-12T03:18:00.000Z	sechs	ubutom	nop, it used to work fine, because i have it instaled on my computer. I installed it from the console....
2010-06-12T03:19:00.000Z	sechs	ubutom	when i installed some songs it ask for the cdrom, but i not have any cd rom. I never have it
2010-06-12T03:20:00.000Z	ubutom	sechs	homepage says : Reads DWI, SM, and KSF files, in addition to its own .dance format.
2010-06-12T03:20:00.000Z	ubutom	sechs	so you have to have some sort of file for it to work, if it worked before
2010-06-12T03:21:00.000Z	ubutom	sechs	nah, seems it has music included, then i don't know... have you tried reinstalling it?
2010-06-12T03:22:00.000Z	sechs	ubutom	I tried, but if I install more songs in .dwi format, it dont work! if it runs I cant dance, but if I can dance it dont run!
2010-06-12T03:23:00.000Z	ubutom		hhm, strange sechs
2010-06-12T03:24:00.000Z	sechs	ubutom	Im getting familiar with strange things with ubuntu
2010-06-12T03:25:00.000Z	ubutom	sechs	pydance has hardly much to do with ubuntu
2010-06-12T03:27:00.000Z	sechs	ubutom	i also tryed to use stepmania with wine, but my wine dont works, so my last hope was pydance.
2010-06-12T03:28:00.000Z	ubutom	sechs	you could always try to contact the makers of pydance
2010-06-12T03:29:00.000Z	sechs	ubutom	i think i will install an older version of ubuntu. My pc dont like 10.04
2010-06-12T03:30:00.000Z	sechs		maybe is the best way to solve my problems. I really dont want to get windows again...
2010-06-12T03:31:00.000Z	ubutom	sechs	well, could solve some problems
2010-06-12T03:35:00.000Z	sechs	ubutom	and if I install kubuntu? it will be easy to use like 10.04?
2010-06-12T03:36:00.000Z	ubutom	sechs	yep, though I don't know how different it is, haven't used kde in a while
2010-06-12T03:37:00.000Z	ubutom	sechs	and maybe you'll run into the same freeze problem, worth a try I would say
2010-06-12T03:37:00.000Z	sechs	ubutom	im dammned with linux, then....
2010-06-12T03:40:00.000Z	sechs	ubutom	i will try to reinstall all, if that doesnt works, i will install kubuntu. but that will wait to tomorrow. Thank you to everyone for the help really. See you soon!
