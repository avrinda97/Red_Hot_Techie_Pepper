2007-06-21T05:15:00.000Z	wesolek		I know that I followed some directions I found in some forums (many of them and none has worked so far)
2007-06-21T05:16:00.000Z	wesolek		jimmey, I am a newbie, and I don't really know what I am doing
2007-06-21T05:17:00.000Z	wesolek		I know it was working in suse
2007-06-21T05:17:00.000Z	wesolek		lol jima21742
2007-06-21T05:17:00.000Z	wesolek		that would be nice
2007-06-21T05:17:00.000Z	wesolek		as I want these nice effects (wobbly windows etc)
2007-06-21T05:19:00.000Z	wesolek		I am on vesa now
2007-06-21T05:20:00.000Z	wesolek		jimmey, I did that yesterday... and it didn't work, so as suggested, I followed the instructions for edgy, and the same result, always had to reconfigure xserver back to vesa to get it back
2007-06-21T05:22:00.000Z	wesolek		what is that red horizontal line that shows up every now and again in here?
2007-06-21T05:23:00.000Z	wesolek		jima, I have no idea how to help you
2007-06-21T05:23:00.000Z	Student	wesolek	Heh, it could be worse - Like not being able to boot at all...
2007-06-21T05:26:00.000Z	Student	wesolek	Ha, ha. Same fear here.
2007-06-21T05:28:00.000Z	Student	wesolek	Yea, sticks out from the crowd.
2007-06-21T05:41:00.000Z	Student	wesolek	I hope not. I'v been trying to get Linux back up for almost 2 days straight now.
2007-06-21T05:42:00.000Z	Student	wesolek	Yea, I even had the chance to cry a few times - Actually cry.
2007-06-21T05:43:00.000Z	Student	wesolek	Yea - now compare that to not even being able to boot - and for no apparent reason - and then imagine me crying - you get the picture.
2007-06-21T05:45:00.000Z	Student	wesolek	Well, you see, I can actually boot from live cd and then mount the partition that I have been using, so it has to be something that I can do without just trashing all my settings. I really don't want to go back to windows - I made a promise.
2007-06-21T05:46:00.000Z	Student	wesolek	I'm crying right now.
2007-06-21T05:48:00.000Z	Student	wesolek	It's not that grub can't find the partition, it's not filesystem corruption, it's not messed up menu.lst - It's just that ubuntu get's stuck at "Mounting filessytem" - I AM GOING INSANE
2007-06-21T05:49:00.000Z	Student	wesolek	It's not the CD - I installed ubuntu more than 6 months ago, it's been working fine, so that live cd is fine.
2007-06-21T05:58:00.000Z	Student	wesolek	Later.
