2005-01-23T09:49:00.000Z	skreet		What do you guys recommend for playing DVD movies?
2005-01-23T09:49:00.000Z	skreet		Wow.
2005-01-23T09:49:00.000Z	skreet		That was helpful. I'm going to buy a DVD player right now..
2005-01-23T09:49:00.000Z	skreet		No it's not.
2005-01-23T09:50:00.000Z	skreet		I open MPC and it works like a charm
2005-01-23T09:50:00.000Z	skreet		:D
2005-01-23T09:50:00.000Z	skreet		apparently mplayer is the way to go but no .deb to be found.
2005-01-23T09:50:00.000Z	skreet		alien causes issues :(
2005-01-23T09:51:00.000Z	chewvl	skreet	doesn't the marillat repo has a .deb for MPlayer?
2005-01-23T09:52:00.000Z	chewvl	skreet	# Marillat's repository for acidrip, acroread, acroread-debian-files, acroread-$deb ftp://ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat/ unstable main
2005-01-23T09:53:00.000Z	chewvl	skreet	binary
2005-01-23T09:56:00.000Z	chewvl	skreet	ahh I think it is a codec issue then, not just the player
2005-01-23T09:59:00.000Z	chewvl	skreet	inTotem, there's an option to -> 'Play Disc' use that
2005-01-23T10:01:00.000Z	chewvl	skreet	yeah install that if you haven't done so already
2005-01-23T10:05:00.000Z	chewvl	skreet	strange...they play well on both me Ubuntu and Debian Sid systems hmm
2005-01-23T10:06:00.000Z	chewvl	skreet	no harm installing me guess
2005-01-23T10:08:00.000Z	chewvl	skreet	do you have /usr/bin/gst-register-0.6 or/and /usr/bin/gst-register-0.8? Run that
2005-01-23T10:12:00.000Z	skreet	chewvl	for the hell of it i tried sudo gxine
2005-01-23T10:12:00.000Z	chewvl	skreet	and you can run it that way?
2005-01-23T10:17:00.000Z	chewvl	skreet	if you have totem-xine, w32codecs, libdvdread3, libdvdread3-dev, libdvdnav-dev, libdvdnav4, libdvdplay0, libdvdplay0-dev, libdvdcss2, libdvdcss2-dev installed...I don't know what else you need hmmm
