2006-08-11T13:47:00.000Z	aarohi		i'm on ubuntu and i have the kubuntu cd added to the repository list and i started installing the kubuntu-desktop package through synaptic but unfortunately it starts downloading packages from the internet. i cancelled. what do i do to make it install the kubuntu packages from cd? someone help please. :)
2006-08-11T13:48:00.000Z	aarohi		anyone?
2006-08-11T13:48:00.000Z	soundray	aarohi	temporarily disable the online repos in synaptic
2006-08-11T13:49:00.000Z	aarohi	soundray	all of them?
2006-08-11T13:50:00.000Z	soundray	aarohi	only the online ones. You need the CD ones enabled, of course.
2006-08-11T13:50:00.000Z	aarohi	soundray	 now there IS no option for kubuntu-desktop in synaptic
2006-08-11T13:51:00.000Z	soundray	aarohi	then you haven't got the required packages on the CD.
2006-08-11T13:52:00.000Z	aarohi	soundray	its the original kubuntu cd
2006-08-11T13:53:00.000Z	soundray	aarohi	then you've probably disabled the CD repo.
2006-08-11T13:54:00.000Z	aarohi	soundray	when i only leave the cd repo enabled, then only the ALREADY installed packages appear
2006-08-11T13:54:00.000Z	soundray	aarohi	have you done an update (click the "Reload" button)
2006-08-11T13:54:00.000Z	aarohi	soundray	yes
2006-08-11T13:55:00.000Z	soundray	aarohi	then I don't know, sorry.
2006-08-11T13:55:00.000Z	aarohi	soundray	thanks
2006-08-12T06:38:00.000Z	soundray	aarohi	were you able to solve your repos problem?
2006-08-12T06:38:00.000Z	aarohi	soundray	not quite. but i installed the kubuntu-desktop successfully from the internet
2006-08-12T06:39:00.000Z	soundray	aarohi	well done... you could have saved some download time by manually copying .deb files from the CD to the package cache.
2006-08-12T06:40:00.000Z	soundray	aarohi	sorry, too late now.
2006-08-12T06:40:00.000Z	aarohi	soundray	indeed. i'm trying to discover the kde environment on ubuntu. not bad, actually.. still looking around :-)
2006-08-12T06:41:00.000Z	soundray	aarohi	did you know that there's a #kubuntu channel?
2006-08-12T06:41:00.000Z	aarohi	soundray	yes i do, but back when i posted my problem there, nobody was able to help so I had to post here
