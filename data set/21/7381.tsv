2007-05-28T12:06:00.000Z	ashwin18		can anyone suggest a good easy to use buttorrent client for ubuntu (except the resource hungry azureus)?
2007-05-28T12:07:00.000Z	ashwin18		ok
2007-05-28T12:07:00.000Z	ashwin18		what is wine, and how do i install it?
2007-05-28T12:07:00.000Z	ashwin18		runs windows programs? wow!
2007-05-28T12:08:00.000Z	ashwin18		okay :)
2007-05-28T12:08:00.000Z	ashwin18		sure
2007-05-28T12:10:00.000Z	ashwin18		just for reference, what is CLI? and what is 'synaptics'?
2007-05-28T12:10:00.000Z	JohnFlux_	ashwin18	command line interface
2007-05-28T12:11:00.000Z	JohnFlux_	ashwin18	CLI is where you type in commands, rather than the GUI where you can use a mouse
2007-05-28T12:11:00.000Z	ashwin18		omg a command line bittorrent program? you mean the one with no GUI?
2007-05-28T12:11:00.000Z	JohnFlux_	ashwin18	right
2007-05-28T12:11:00.000Z	ashwin18		that will be very difficult to use
2007-05-28T12:11:00.000Z	JohnFlux_	ashwin18	I use a CLI bittorrent program too :-)
2007-05-28T12:12:00.000Z	JohnFlux_	ashwin18	for fun you could try it if you wanted
2007-05-28T12:12:00.000Z	ashwin18	magnetron	is synaptic to be used to install ALL kinds of software on ubuntu?
2007-05-28T12:12:00.000Z	JohnFlux_	ashwin18	it's not that hard.  you save the torrent file in your home directory say, the run konsole, then type in "rtorrent  nameoffile.torrent"
2007-05-28T12:12:00.000Z	JohnFlux_	ashwin18	and that's it.
2007-05-28T12:13:00.000Z	ashwin18		another question, what's repositories?
2007-05-28T12:13:00.000Z	ashwin18		the official ubuntu software distributions?
2007-05-28T12:13:00.000Z	JohnFlux_	ashwin18	it's where you get programs from
2007-05-28T12:13:00.000Z	JohnFlux_	ashwin18	right
