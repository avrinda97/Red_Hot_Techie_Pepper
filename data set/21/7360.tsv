2007-02-07T08:20:00.000Z	soundray	bulmer	that's a security risk
2007-02-07T08:20:00.000Z	bulmer	soundray	what are you talking about? if you are not root..you follow?
2007-02-07T08:21:00.000Z	bulmer	soundray	can you elaborate on this risk you speak of? we'd like to learn
2007-02-07T08:22:00.000Z	soundray	bulmer	is this really necessary? This risk is extremely well known.
2007-02-07T08:22:00.000Z	bulmer	soundray	yes it is necessary, elaborate on your understanding of the so called risk please
2007-02-07T08:22:00.000Z	soundray	bulmer	I don't like your tone. If you want something from me, you will have to ask nicely.
2007-02-07T08:23:00.000Z	bulmer	soundray	 im merely disputing your so-called risk..you are not telling the whole story
2007-02-07T08:26:00.000Z	soundray	bulmer	doing damage to a system doesn't always require root rights.
2007-02-07T08:27:00.000Z	soundray	bulmer	test this: 'echo 'rm -rf $HOME' >/tmp/ls ; cd /tmp ; ls' (I mean, don't)
2007-02-07T08:29:00.000Z	bulmer	soundray	umm is that executable ? missing a step to make it executable
2007-02-07T08:30:00.000Z	soundray	bulmer	there are other steps missing as well. It does prove the principle, though.
2007-02-07T08:30:00.000Z	soundray	bulmer	if you're finding that too hard to grasp, maybe you shouldn't second-guess people warning about security risks.
2007-02-07T08:31:00.000Z	bulmer	soundray	to each his own
2007-02-10T09:36:00.000Z	soundray	bulmer	getent can be used to retrieve a user name from the command line when you know the ID
2007-02-10T09:43:00.000Z	bulmer	soundray	isnt it that the 1 in the man pages signifies those are C program commands and not really a command line command?
2007-02-10T09:44:00.000Z	soundray	bulmer	no. Man section 3 is for system calls iirc
2007-08-14T08:02:00.000Z	soundray	bulmer	Alex: tulip has been part of the Linux kernel for over a decade
2007-08-14T08:03:00.000Z	bulmer	soundray	but that chip may not be using tulip
2007-08-14T08:04:00.000Z	soundray	bulmer	that's right, although I thought it did
2007-10-29T02:38:00.000Z	soundray	bulmer	no, that's not necessary (Niteye)
