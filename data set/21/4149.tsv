2008-09-25T03:47:00.000Z	snova		how do i restart the x server?
2008-09-25T03:48:00.000Z	Gerinych	snova	just so you know, I'm trying to run it on a PC
2008-09-25T03:48:00.000Z	snova	Gerinych	i think you need a port of grub called grub-efi, but i'm not sure.
2008-09-25T03:48:00.000Z	Gerinych	snova	just so you know, I'm trying to run it on a PC
2008-09-25T03:49:00.000Z	snova	Gerinych	never mind then. i've never used mac, but if grub can't load the kernel directly, find its bootloader and chainload it.
2008-09-25T03:50:00.000Z	Gerinych	snova	ok hold on; here's what I have in my menu.lst: root (hd1,0) chainloader +1
2008-09-25T03:51:00.000Z	Gerinych	snova	basically what I'm asking is how to boot a hfs+ partition
2008-09-25T03:52:00.000Z	snova	Gerinych	that looks correct, but i don't mess with grub much. once i get it working, i tend to ignore it. besides, i've never need the chainloader feature. i don't even know if it supports hfs+, though it supports quite a few fs's.
2008-09-25T03:52:00.000Z	snova	Gerinych	all i know is that chainloading the partition should theoretically do it.
2008-09-25T03:53:00.000Z	Gerinych	snova	thanks, ill try to do something
2008-09-25T03:53:00.000Z	snova	Gerinych	i'm restarting x again, goodbye for now
2008-09-25T03:54:00.000Z	Gerinych	snova	bye
2008-09-25T03:54:00.000Z	snova	Gerinych	i'm back!
2008-09-25T03:57:00.000Z	Gerinych	snova	wait, i don't get it, am I supposed to boot mac like a linux kernel, or like windows?
2008-09-25T04:03:00.000Z	Gerinych	snova	am I supposed to boot mac like a linux kernel, or like windows?
2008-09-25T04:04:00.000Z	snova	Gerinych	no idea. like i said, i've never used mac and am unfamiliar with its boot sequence.
2008-09-25T04:05:00.000Z	Gerinych	snova	OSx86
2008-09-25T04:05:00.000Z	Gerinych	snova	not sure whether its Hackintosh or not
2008-09-25T04:05:00.000Z	snova	Gerinych	all i can suggest is to google it.
2008-09-25T04:05:00.000Z	Gerinych	snova	alright
2008-09-25T04:05:00.000Z	snova	Gerinych	if nothing comes up, chainloading is the only option, but i don't know much about it.
