2005-12-19T11:32:00.000Z	B-166_ER-X		well, i have been able to acess them on another ubuntu breezy PC
2005-12-19T11:32:00.000Z	B-166_ER-X		but for now, the motherboard of the other pc is screwed..so..
2005-12-19T11:33:00.000Z	B-166_ER-X		Bus 001 Device 004: ID 040a:0131 Kodak Co. DC-5000

2005-12-19T11:33:00.000Z	B-166_ER-X		but not quite
2005-12-19T11:34:00.000Z	quacker	B-166_ER-X	does you camera have removeable media?
2005-12-19T11:34:00.000Z	B-166_ER-X		hm, yes, flash card
2005-12-19T11:34:00.000Z	B-166_ER-X		quacker
2005-12-19T11:35:00.000Z	quacker		If so, you can do what I do and mount the media (in my case  compact flash card) and then decode with dcraw
2005-12-19T11:35:00.000Z	B-166_ER-X		Please make sure there is sufficient quoting around the arguments.
2005-12-19T11:35:00.000Z	quacker	B-166_ER-X	 You will need to copy the partition first
2005-12-19T11:35:00.000Z	B-166_ER-X		hee
2005-12-19T11:35:00.000Z	B-166_ER-X		looks kind -too- complicated
2005-12-19T11:36:00.000Z	quacker		then you convert the files a few at a time from .RAW format using dcraw (too many and you may hang your machine as decoding is CPU intensive)
2005-12-19T11:38:00.000Z	B-166_ER-X	quacker	theres gotta be a simpler way, i am able to get the 3 first pics, then it stopp
2005-12-19T11:39:00.000Z	quacker	B-166_ER-X	sorry, that's how I do it with an Olympus E-300 that's all I know
