2010-07-13T00:05:00.000Z	gordon_gekko		How can I get on the kernel line in 2.6.32-23-generic?
2010-07-13T00:06:00.000Z	guntbert	gordon_gekko	you question is not clear for me: what do you want to do?
2010-07-13T00:07:00.000Z	gordon_gekko	guntbert	I have a problem with my VGA out and I have to set radeon.new_pll=0 in the Kernel line but I cannot find the file to set it
2010-07-13T00:07:00.000Z	guntbert	gordon_gekko	understood - do you have grub or grub2 ?
2010-07-13T00:09:00.000Z	gordon_gekko	guntbert	i think it is grub. how can i double check?
2010-07-13T00:10:00.000Z	guntbert	gordon_gekko	ls -l /boot/grub/menu.lst
2010-07-13T00:13:00.000Z	gordon_gekko	guntbert	the file menu.lst doesn't exist
2010-07-13T00:15:00.000Z	guntbert	gordon_gekko	then you have grub 2, please open (with any editor) /etc/default/grub
2010-07-13T00:16:00.000Z	gordon_gekko	guntbert	I am in
2010-07-13T00:17:00.000Z	gordon_gekko	guntbert	should I look for a specific file?
2010-07-13T00:19:00.000Z	guntbert	gordon_gekko	that *is* a file (please check with the page ubottu sent you above) find the line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="noquiet splash"
2010-07-13T00:22:00.000Z	gordon_gekko	guntbert	it says that the equivalent file to the menu... is not editable in GRUB2 :(
2010-07-13T00:23:00.000Z	guntbert	gordon_gekko	I believe I asked you to open /etc/default/grub - if I didn't -- please open it now
2010-07-13T00:29:00.000Z	gordon_gekko	guntbert	I am in the file
2010-07-13T00:30:00.000Z	guntbert	gordon_gekko	 find the line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="noquiet splash", .... halt - did you try your parameter already?
2010-07-13T00:33:00.000Z	gordon_gekko	guntbert	no I have not tried the parameter yet. The line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="noquiet splash" does not appear in the file
2010-07-13T00:34:00.000Z	gordon_gekko	guntbert	should i try the paremeter at the end of the text?
2010-07-13T00:36:00.000Z	guntbert	gordon_gekko	I recommend testing it first: when you reboot press <shift> to get the grub menu and follow the procedure in https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Editing%20Menus%20During%20Boot
2010-07-13T00:36:00.000Z	guntbert	gordon_gekko	that will be a one time trial only, so you don't make your system unusable if it is no good
2010-07-13T00:37:00.000Z	gordon_gekko	guntbert	thank you for all of your help!
2010-07-13T00:37:00.000Z	guntbert	gordon_gekko	you are very welcome :-)
