2010-05-27T09:48:00.000Z	Doyle	tdhz77	32, dual 2ghz 4g ram
2010-05-27T09:43:00.000Z	tdhz77	Doyle	flash is terrible. Not linux.
2010-05-27T09:45:00.000Z	Doyle	tdhz77	I know Linux is great and flash is evil, but flash still plays great when the source is local. I want to know why they can't make a player that renders it well in a browser I guess.
2010-05-27T09:46:00.000Z	tdhz77	Doyle	which browser?
2010-05-27T09:47:00.000Z	Doyle	tdhz77	I've tried the usual suspects: Firefox, Chrome, The one that starts with O that I can't think of.
2010-05-27T09:47:00.000Z	Doyle	tdhz77	I install the beta flash packages as they become available
2010-05-27T09:49:00.000Z	tdhz77	Doyle	Firefox and chrome do not do well with flash video. Often times spikes CPU usage and memory cough "leaks" ... Try a lighter browser without all of the bloat of the big three and half and you will start flying to new levels of flash streaming.
2010-05-27T09:50:00.000Z	Doyle	tdhz77	browser leaks are devistating since tabbed browsing came in. I remember the day when I might have two windows open to browse... now sometimes I catch myself with 15 tabs on the go. Any recommnedations for lite browsers?
2010-05-27T09:53:00.000Z	Doyle	tdhz77	Beauty, I'll give that one a shot. Thanks a lot
2010-05-27T10:19:00.000Z	Doyle	tdhz77	Got epiphany and installed Tuesdays Flash RC6 release. It's improved to a watchable state with only a few 1/8s ticks every now and then.
2010-05-27T10:20:00.000Z	Doyle	tdhz77	Much better than in firefox
2010-05-27T10:20:00.000Z	Doyle	tdhz77	I'm looking forward to the free google codec... trying to remember what it was called
2010-05-27T10:21:00.000Z	Doyle	tdhz77	WebM based on a few existing free licenced products
2010-05-27T10:23:00.000Z	Doyle	tdhz77	haha, that'd make a good t-shirt. Someday the internet will be good. No regulation on traffic, no preference to types of traffic over public networks, no restriction on global content (no borders), free music and videos!
2010-05-27T10:24:00.000Z	Doyle	tdhz77	I live in Canada
2010-05-27T10:24:00.000Z	Doyle	tdhz77	they dont bother us here lol
2010-05-27T10:25:00.000Z	Doyle	tdhz77	I gotta give it to adobe though, by flash rc11 I think online flash content will play quite well.
2010-05-27T10:26:00.000Z	Doyle	tdhz77	a few more months for 11  :/
2010-05-28T10:48:00.000Z	Doyle	tdhz77	I think after you type '/etc/fstab' you just have to enter the details. Found a good ref. http://www.tuxation.com/creating-home-partition-mac-linux.html
2010-05-28T10:54:00.000Z	Doyle	tdhz77	did that work?
