2010-10-06T04:24:00.000Z	mamece2	arvut	ive tryed in almost every thread in ubuntu, no one get an anwser just like me
2010-10-06T04:25:00.000Z	mamece2	arvut	i cant believe i need to have my files locally, my library is very big, is in an external HD. it was so easy in winamp, just one scan of the external HD and that all a library was created, everytime i close and opened again, it was there
2010-10-06T04:27:00.000Z	arvut	mamece2	maybe you don't? there surely must be some way around it. carry on, as long as you don't give up then there is a chance you will solve the problem on your own.
2010-10-06T05:21:00.000Z	arvut	mamece2	welcome back & well done =) you probably did something even if you don't know what you did, I do that all the time ^^
2010-10-06T05:21:00.000Z	mamece2	arvut	i dont like that :( but it worked :p
2010-10-06T05:25:00.000Z	arvut	mamece2	why not? you solved the problem after all. swap is the virtual memory, mostly a small partition on your hdd
2010-10-06T05:30:00.000Z	mamece2	arvut	im a man of science i like to know why things happen, i dont believe in magic :p
2010-10-06T05:32:00.000Z	arvut	mamece2	I see 'magic' as the things we see happen but can't understand. After all, we are only human ;) hope you will have the patience to learn this great OS, some day you might understand all of it (unlikely tho) :P
2010-10-11T04:04:00.000Z	arvut	mamece2	what's your problem today?

2010-10-11T04:17:00.000Z	arvut	mamece2	they say that we scientific ppl have magical hands when it comes to solving problems. hell I don't understand all I do at all times either. well done =P
2010-10-11T04:23:00.000Z	mamece2	arvut	now theres another impossible problem, is about my mx5000 keyboard, it does sync with the laptop, but i does nothing, BEAT DAT!
2010-10-11T04:25:00.000Z	arvut	mamece2	 a neat challenge for you to deal with then, problemsolving is to me both rewarding and mostly fun =)
2010-10-11T04:26:00.000Z	arvut	mamece2	maybe it's a driver issue?
2010-10-11T04:26:00.000Z	mamece2	arvut	iono i must investigate, but now im finding the san francisco rush: extreme racing OST, anyone?
