2008-01-14T06:51:00.000Z	mattholimeau		my login screen goes "out of range" on my monitor.. does someone know how i can fix that?
2008-01-14T06:51:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	mattholimeau	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg     try selecting your card if that does not work.. select vesa mode  and 1024 max res
2008-01-14T06:54:00.000Z	mattholimeau	Jack_Sparrow	i've done that a bunch of times and it's finally working right for everything but the login screen... i'm really nervous about running that again and messing it up
2008-01-14T06:54:00.000Z	mattholimeau	Jack_Sparrow	it doesn't detect my video hardware, and i think vesa is what i've got it set to now
2008-01-14T06:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	mattholimeau	USe the pastebin to post your xorg so someone can look it over.. then provide us with the link

2008-01-14T06:59:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	mattholimeau	thanks.. looking now
2008-01-14T07:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	mattholimeau	Line 656 says you are set to nvidia.. and the monitor v/h settings look generic and not something you entered yourself..  Is theis a desktop or laptop and did you TRY to install any video drivers yourself as in from nvidia
2008-01-14T07:03:00.000Z	mattholimeau	Jack_Sparrow	no - i think where it got that was that i selected nvidia from the menu from the command you gave me before
2008-01-14T07:03:00.000Z	mattholimeau	Jack_Sparrow	and i know i'm definitely running an nvidia card
2008-01-14T07:03:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	mattholimeau	If desktop monitor.. google up the specs on your hardware...
2008-01-14T07:04:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	mattholimeau	Is this a desktop or laptop
2008-01-14T07:05:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	mattholimeau	Use google to find the spec on your monitor v/h refresh rates
2008-01-14T07:11:00.000Z	mattholimeau	Jack_Sparrow	i already did that - once i did that and everything was working fine, the login screen died
2008-01-14T07:11:00.000Z	mattholimeau	Jack_Sparrow	do you know if there's a different place that the login screen gets those specs?
2008-01-14T07:12:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	mattholimeau	there is vga=7xx   in grub ?  not sure of the numbers
2008-01-14T07:12:00.000Z	mattholimeau	Jack_Sparrow	someone told me to enter something like 798 there, and that didn't work
2008-01-14T07:13:00.000Z	mattholimeau	Jack_Sparrow	is there somewhere i can determine exactly what number should be there?
2008-01-14T07:13:00.000Z	mattholimeau	Jack_Sparrow	that another google thing?
2008-01-14T07:15:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	mattholimeau	NOt sure what those numbers represent...  You can try google.. but please let me know if you find a good link on the subjest
2008-01-14T07:15:00.000Z	mattholimeau	Jack_Sparrow	sure, i'll see what i can find
