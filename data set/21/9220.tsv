2006-03-07T08:32:00.000Z	shukhrat		Ubuntu !
2006-03-07T08:34:00.000Z	shukhrat		good evening everyone! I can't modify, delete, or rename files in /var/www/ directory. Property says the owner is www-data and group www-data. How can I change the files? And how to become root for graphic X-server? Thanks!
2006-03-07T08:35:00.000Z	Ng	shukhrat	the easiest way might be to add your user to the www-data group ("sudo adduser yourusername www-data"
2006-03-07T08:52:00.000Z	shukhrat	Ng	i could't still change anythink in /var/www
2006-03-07T08:53:00.000Z	Ng	shukhrat	you'd probably need to log out and back in for it to take effect
2006-03-07T08:58:00.000Z	shukhrat	Ng	no success
2006-03-07T08:59:00.000Z	Ng	shukhrat	hmm, weird. I suppose you could just chown -R the directory to your user, but that's not ideal really
2006-03-07T09:02:00.000Z	shukhrat	Ng	how can I become a user that can delete, modify, or rename any files in the computer?
2006-03-07T09:02:00.000Z	Ng	shukhrat	see what ubotu just messaged you
2006-03-13T06:27:00.000Z	shukhrat	Ng	hello, you have helped me a lot
2006-03-13T06:29:00.000Z	Ng	shukhrat	edit /etc/apache2/sites-available/default and change the DocumentRoot setting
2006-03-13T06:31:00.000Z	shukhrat	Ng	thanks a lot!
2006-03-13T06:52:00.000Z	shukhrat	Ng	I successfully changed the directory but now i should add the port number to localhost; http://localhost:8080/ Do you any other way to get rid of this port number?
2006-03-13T06:53:00.000Z	Ng	shukhrat	/etc/apache2/ports.conf
2006-03-13T06:54:00.000Z	shukhrat	Ng	it used to be Listen 80 and I changed it to 8080
2006-03-13T07:00:00.000Z	Ng	shukhrat	have you restarted apache?
2006-03-13T07:03:00.000Z	shukhrat	Ng	yes i restarted
2006-03-13T07:04:00.000Z	shukhrat	Ng	if i type in the browser localhost it uses the old directory (port 80) if you add the port number to the address bar (localhost:8080) it opens the new directory
2006-03-13T07:20:00.000Z	shukhrat	Ng	how i can uninstall Apache in ubuntu?
2006-03-14T08:45:00.000Z	shukhrat	Ng	how to know how many apache servers are installed in my computer?
