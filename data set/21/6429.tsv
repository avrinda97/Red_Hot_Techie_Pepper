2007-04-29T07:09:00.000Z	Enverex	Puppy_	You need to ask a question
2007-04-29T07:11:00.000Z	Puppy_	Enverex	I had a working drive set up with NTFS-3g and it stopped mounting. I just need someone to walk me through the steps of setting it up again.
2007-04-29T07:12:00.000Z	Enverex	Puppy_	erm, just "ntfs3g /dev/whatever /where/you/want/it" is the way to do it
2007-04-29T07:13:00.000Z	Puppy_	Enverex	/etc/fstab? Or the terminal?
2007-04-29T07:13:00.000Z	Enverex	Puppy_	term
