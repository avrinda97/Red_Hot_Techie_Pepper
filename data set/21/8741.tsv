2006-01-23T07:47:00.000Z	glacious		hello
2006-01-23T07:47:00.000Z	glacious		does anyone know how to change your refresh rate if only one is offered in the resolution control panel?
2006-01-23T07:47:00.000Z	glacious		i'm tyring to stop this bouncing box on my monitor saying "mode not supported".  the desktop displays fine behind it, just that the box keeps bouncing.
2006-01-23T07:48:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	glacious	edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf and change the HorizSync and VertRefresh values.
2006-01-23T07:48:00.000Z	glacious	PuMpErNiCkLe	i did, but no change.
2006-01-23T07:49:00.000Z	glacious	PuMpErNiCkLe	why does it only show 85hz as an option in GNome?
2006-01-23T07:49:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	glacious	Possibly because you set those variable as a specific value, not a range?
2006-01-23T07:50:00.000Z	glacious	PuMpErNiCkLe	change them under 'monitor' or 'screen'?
2006-01-23T07:51:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	glacious	"Monitor"
2006-01-23T07:52:00.000Z	glacious	PuMpErNiCkLe	thank you, i'll try changing some stuff =)
2006-01-23T07:52:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	glacious	np :)
2006-01-23T07:55:00.000Z	glacious	PuMpErNiCkLe	no luck =(
2006-01-23T07:56:00.000Z	glacious	PuMpErNiCkLe	added HorizSync 30-83 and VertRefresh 55-75 under the Monitor section, under Option "DPMS"
2006-01-23T07:56:00.000Z	glacious	PuMpErNiCkLe	then did /etc/init.d/gdm restart,  still just shows 85hz as the only refresh rate =(
2006-01-23T08:01:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	glacious	Odd - could you copy your xorg.conf to the the pastebin?
2006-01-23T11:12:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	glacious	yup
2006-01-23T11:12:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	glacious	Yeah... apt-get dist-upgrade is the command.
2006-01-23T11:13:00.000Z	glacious	PuMpErNiCkLe	wow, excellent.  then 'bam', it's all 6.x when it comes out.  even the kernel?  or do you manually recompile that?
2006-01-23T11:13:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	glacious	Nope, that'll take care of everything.
2006-01-23T11:13:00.000Z	glacious	PuMpErNiCkLe	wow, thats amazing.
2006-01-23T11:13:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	glacious	Gotta love apt. :)
