2011-04-10T17:52:00.000Z	Mahjongg		how to add kernel-ppa?
2011-04-10T17:54:00.000Z	arand	Mahjongg	In general you don't want to add the kernel-PPA
2011-04-10T17:55:00.000Z	Mahjongg	arand	what is the proper way?
2011-04-10T17:55:00.000Z	arand	Mahjongg	Or, hmm, what is it you want to test with the new kernel.
2011-04-10T17:55:00.000Z	arand	Mahjongg	(Depending, I might be wrong.)
2011-04-10T17:55:00.000Z	Mahjongg	arand	sleep does not work anymore since I upgraded to maverick from lucid
2011-04-10T17:58:00.000Z	arand	Mahjongg	And you want to test with the very bleeding edge or just a somewhat updated version?
2011-04-10T17:58:00.000Z	Mahjongg	arand	yes any of the two
2011-04-10T18:01:00.000Z	arand	Mahjongg	https://launchpad.net/~canonical-kernel-team/+archive/ppa might be possible to temorarily add, and install.
2011-04-10T18:02:00.000Z	Mahjongg	arand	seems like all they have is 2.6.35-28.50 I have 2.6.35-28.49 currently
2011-04-10T18:04:00.000Z	arand	Mahjongg	That one is supposed to be for testing and debugging mainly though, it may give a hint if it is something that is in the works though, and will help if you create a bug stating that it is fixed in mainline, which may allow them to backport the fix
2011-04-10T18:05:00.000Z	Mahjongg	arand	would you think a clean install would help?
2011-04-10T18:05:00.000Z	Mahjongg	arand	i had upgraded from lucid where it was working perfectly
2011-04-10T18:06:00.000Z	arand	Mahjongg	I would guess that a reinstall might not fix it, do you happen to have the kernels left from your Lucid install by the way?
2011-04-10T18:07:00.000Z	Mahjongg	arand	nope, removed all since I did not have problem with kernels for a loong time
2011-04-10T18:46:00.000Z	Mahjongg	arand	actually the system sleeps fine after 10 minutes, fails to sleep when lid is closed... how about that?
2011-04-10T18:47:00.000Z	arand	Mahjongg	Well... I don't know...
2011-04-10T18:47:00.000Z	Mahjongg	arand	all right, thanks
2011-04-10T18:56:00.000Z	Mahjongg	arand	WaltherFI, FYI I played with power manager options, changed all individual setting to something else, saved, set them back to what I'd like and now everything seems to work fine.
2011-04-10T18:56:00.000Z	Mahjongg	arand	WaltherFI, did not need to change the default kernel
2011-04-10T18:56:00.000Z	arand	Mahjongg	Excellent.
