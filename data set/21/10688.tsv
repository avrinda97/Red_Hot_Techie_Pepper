2004-12-21T11:44:00.000Z	redfan		I just got ubuntu...... excellent linux distro..... btw yes i'm a bit of a newb
2004-12-21T11:46:00.000Z	redfan		err.. does anyone know how to install icons?  I've been looking at faq's and getting nowhere.
2004-12-21T11:47:00.000Z	paradoxmo	redfan	like where, on the panel or in the menu?
2004-12-21T11:48:00.000Z	redfan	paradoxmo	generally everywhere i think, i got the tuxntosh icons and have little idea how to install them in the right place or how to select them with theme manager...
2004-12-21T11:50:00.000Z	paradoxmo	redfan	do you mean an icon theme? or like, launchers to get programs to run?
2004-12-21T11:50:00.000Z	redfan	paradoxmo	icon theme
2004-12-21T11:53:00.000Z	redfan	paradoxmo	i do not see icons option in Computer menu, just theme.
2004-12-21T11:54:00.000Z	paradoxmo	redfan	go into the theme dialog
2004-12-21T11:54:00.000Z	redfan	paradoxmo	yup i'm in themes (showing Default, Glider etc)
2004-12-21T11:55:00.000Z	redfan	paradoxmo	then select icon yeah?
2004-12-21T11:56:00.000Z	paradoxmo	redfan	yeah, and then "install theme" on the right
2004-12-21T12:00:00.000Z	redfan	paradoxmo	I'm there but it does not install, In my uncompressed directory I just have folders with 16x16, 192x192 and a index.theme
2004-12-21T12:01:00.000Z	paradoxmo	redfan	try pointing it to the uncompressed archive
2004-12-21T12:04:00.000Z	redfan	paradoxmo	ok it installed and I have clicked go to theme folder it shows Authors, index.theme, readme and a tux1png.zip file
2004-12-21T12:05:00.000Z	redfan	paradoxmo	i still do not see the theme in the icon page of themes
2004-12-21T12:05:00.000Z	paradoxmo	redfan	did you try getting out of theme applet and going back in
2004-12-21T12:08:00.000Z	redfan	paradoxmo	yup have closed themes and reopended it, still no theme in icons.
2004-12-21T12:29:00.000Z	redfan	paradoxmo	nope this aint working, have followed the Gnome faq on this and still will not show the theme for selection
2004-12-21T12:36:00.000Z	paradoxmo	redfan	maybe the icon theme isn't compatible... try looking for a different version? or try installing a different theme see if it works
2004-12-21T12:37:00.000Z	redfan	paradoxmo	cheers.. i will look and keep trying thnx man
