2010-04-24T08:27:00.000Z	PeterDrop	iceroot	no, just i need to recover the database
2010-04-24T08:27:00.000Z	iceroot	PeterDrop	start windows, put it there start mysql, make a dump and import it into mysql-server
2010-04-24T08:28:00.000Z	iceroot	PeterDrop	also you can try to copy them into /var/lib/mysql/
2010-04-24T08:28:00.000Z	iceroot	PeterDrop	the db-files only
2010-04-24T08:28:00.000Z	PeterDrop	iceroot	i will try that, txs
2010-04-24T08:28:00.000Z	iceroot	PeterDrop	and do backups with mysqldump and not with files
2010-04-24T08:29:00.000Z	PeterDrop	iceroot	yes i will dont forget that now xD
2010-04-24T08:30:00.000Z	PeterDrop	iceroot	i have another problem with that, actually i need to put that database files, in a hosting .. :S
2010-04-24T08:31:00.000Z	PeterDrop	iceroot	i think i have to mount a local server for put the files there and then make a backup
2010-04-24T08:31:00.000Z	iceroot	PeterDrop	of course, dont to that on production-system!
2010-04-24T08:33:00.000Z	PeterDrop	iceroot	i think is not wamp in ubuntu xD so ... can u apointme in some direction in order to get a functional local hosting?
2010-04-24T08:33:00.000Z	iceroot	PeterDrop	sudo apt-get install mysql-server
2010-04-24T08:34:00.000Z	iceroot	PeterDrop	then put your db files in /var/lib/mysql/
2010-04-24T08:37:00.000Z	iceroot	PeterDrop	if you want a fully lamp, please dont use xamp or other sugestions here, just use  sudo apt-get install apache2 php5 mysql-server phpmyadmin
2010-04-24T08:42:00.000Z	iceroot	PeterDrop	lamp is a meta-package, xamp is a distribution
2010-04-24T08:43:00.000Z	iceroot	PeterDrop	as i told already  sudo apt-get install apache2 php5 mysql-server  and if you want, also phpmyadmin
2010-04-24T08:57:00.000Z	iceroot	PeterDrop	have a loog at mod_userdir so you dont have to fight with /var/www and root:root
