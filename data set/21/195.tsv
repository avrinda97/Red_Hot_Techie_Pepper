2012-06-11T02:34:00.000Z	sleepie^eyes		how do i configure ubuntu such that internet ports are denied by default unless specified explicity as allowed?
2012-06-11T02:35:00.000Z	sleepie^eyes		Why shorewall? I've heard that mentioned before
2012-06-11T02:36:00.000Z	sleepie^eyes		Anyway to do this without learning how to configure iptables would be appreciated
2012-06-11T02:36:00.000Z	BlueEagle	sleepie^eyes	Because I configure my firewall using a text-based interface and I have found Shorewall to be the most usable when it comes to flexibility and learning curve. Mind you thoug; configure it when you've got physical access to the computer. You will most likely lock yourself out of a ssh-session by mistake if you try. :)
2012-06-11T02:38:00.000Z	sleepie^eyes		I'd be happy if I could just be sure I'm the only one using ssh on this network... that's good advice, I'm probably headed in that direction, for now I'd like some basic port blocking
2012-06-11T02:38:00.000Z	BlueEagle	sleepie^eyes	Are you setting up a single box or will you be routing for other computers as well (windows equivalent of internet connection sharing)?
2012-06-11T02:39:00.000Z	sleepie^eyes	BlueEagle	That depends on which "road" I take, if I learn iptables I will configure it in the dd-wrt router to benefit the network as a whole, otherwise just one linux box
2012-06-11T02:41:00.000Z	sleepie^eyes		sudont should be a command for password protecting blocking of sudo managed commands
2012-06-11T02:42:00.000Z	sleepie^eyes	BlueEagle	one linux box. What do you suggest?
2012-06-11T02:42:00.000Z	sleepie^eyes		I have to do the box itself anyway since it's mobile
2012-06-11T02:44:00.000Z	BlueEagle	sleepie^eyes	I recommend installing shorewall and then reading the documentation. There is a complete setup in /usr/share/doc/shorewall/examples/one-interface/ after installing.
2012-06-11T02:45:00.000Z	sleepie^eyes	BlueEagle	I just started, thanks, I forgot about shorewall
2012-06-11T02:45:00.000Z	BlueEagle	sleepie^eyes	The thing I like most about Shorewall is that you can add interfaces and zones, even network cards after the wall is set up and just add the policies and rules for the new zones and leaving the old ones intact.
2012-06-11T02:46:00.000Z	BlueEagle	sleepie^eyes	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1354438 may also help you along. Even if it is for 08.10 the Shorewall configuration is robust.
2012-06-11T02:46:00.000Z	sleepie^eyes	BlueEagle	that's a bit advanced for me, I understand the concept mostly
2012-06-11T02:47:00.000Z	BlueEagle	sleepie^eyes	It would be a great learning opportunity. :)
2012-06-11T02:47:00.000Z	sleepie^eyes		Like, editing a sample config file or making a simple one was what I had in mind but shorewall hard code me into limitation later so I'll start that, thanks again
2012-06-11T02:48:00.000Z	sleepie^eyes		shorewall ^won't
2012-06-11T02:48:00.000Z	sleepie^eyes		kinda essential
2012-06-11T02:48:00.000Z	sleepie^eyes		laters :)
2012-06-11T03:19:00.000Z	sleepie^eyes	BlueEagle	are you still nafk? I could use the tutorial link you recommended for shorewall, the one I selected is dated
