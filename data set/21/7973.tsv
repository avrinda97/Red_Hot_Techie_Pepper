2006-06-14T09:53:00.000Z	untwisted		It is :P
2006-06-14T09:53:00.000Z	untwisted		I'm not sure whats causing it
2006-06-14T09:54:00.000Z	untwisted		Whats your desktop size set to anyway?
2006-06-14T09:55:00.000Z	untwisted		whats your xorg.conf look like?
2006-06-14T09:55:00.000Z	untwisted		and what type of card are you using?
2006-06-14T09:56:00.000Z	untwisted		Nice, acer laptop? ;)
2006-06-14T09:57:00.000Z	untwisted		haha, I have a ferrari 3200 :)
2006-06-14T09:57:00.000Z	untwisted		anyway, any chance I could get a peek at your xorg.conf file?  It may be something in there.  Probably be best to email it though, if you don't mind, untwisted@gmail.com be my address.
2006-06-14T09:58:00.000Z	untwisted		Acer went bust or the generic company did?
2006-06-14T09:58:00.000Z	untwisted		Well, I'll admit I'm no expert so this may not help at all, but if my hunch is right we might be able to fix ya right up
2006-06-14T09:59:00.000Z	Kryton	untwisted	sent the email :-) Thanks for this!
2006-06-14T09:53:00.000Z	Kryton	untwisted	seems a bit of a hack ;P
2006-06-14T09:55:00.000Z	Kryton	untwisted	it's 1400x1050 (laptop) and is fine if i set it using gnome-display-properties (i.e. set down to 1280 then up to 1400)
2006-06-14T10:04:00.000Z	untwisted	Kryton	when you boot up what is the resolution set to?  The 1400x1050 or higher?
2006-06-14T10:05:00.000Z	Kryton	untwisted	it's set to 1400x1050 but upscaled 4 times .. if you get me?
2006-06-14T10:11:00.000Z	untwisted	Kryton	your single desktop is spread over 4 virtual desktops, right?
2006-06-14T10:11:00.000Z	Kryton	untwisted	yep
2006-06-14T10:13:00.000Z	untwisted	Kryton	the xorg looks fine to me, you may want to remove some of the other display modes and see if that fixes it but it doesn't look like thats the problem.  I can modify the xorg file and send it back to you if you want.
2006-06-14T10:14:00.000Z	Kryton	untwisted	I'll try dropping some display modes and see if that works. Thanks for looking
2006-06-14T10:17:00.000Z	untwisted	Kryton	was your desktop always this way or did it just start happening?  Also have you checked the desktop changer options?  Maybe its one of them?
2006-06-14T10:18:00.000Z	Kryton	untwisted	it just 'started like this'; the desktop changer works but isn't persistent for some reason
