2006-11-09T10:53:00.000Z	Cholito		weird stuff: I can't hear anything (the computer I mean....) but I see amarok showing the analizer moving. I was watching a movie today so I KNOW the sound card works

2006-11-09T10:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Cholito	Flash 7 screws up sound, restart then install flash9 instead
2006-11-09T10:57:00.000Z	Cholito		restart FF?
2006-11-09T10:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U		!flash9 Cholito
2006-11-09T10:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Cholito	Your system, there is a command to just restart the sound but I can't find it again, restarting the computer will do it though.
