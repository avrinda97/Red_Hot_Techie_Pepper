2005-07-13T07:28:00.000Z	ed1t	jasoncohen	where do i get the hoary-extras?
2005-07-13T07:29:00.000Z	jasoncohen	ed1t	add "deb http://ubuntu-backports.mirrormax.net/ hoary-extras main universe multiverse restricted" to /etc/apt/sources.list and apt-get update
2005-07-13T07:29:00.000Z	jasoncohen	ed1t	only use it if you need something from extras
2005-07-13T07:32:00.000Z	ed1t	jasoncohen	i just installed ubuntu like 2 days ago, so im pretty new
2005-07-13T07:33:00.000Z	jasoncohen	ed1t	this web page gives info on the official packages provided by ubuntu. only main is fully supported. - http://www.ubuntulinux.org/ubuntu/components
2005-07-13T07:33:00.000Z	jasoncohen	ed1t	however hoary-extras provides packages that couldn't be included in ubuntu like multimedia codecs that have legal issues - for example libdvdcss2 which is illegal in the US but needed to watch most commercial DVDs
2005-07-13T07:34:00.000Z	ed1t	jasoncohen	oooo so its like illegal packages
2005-07-13T07:34:00.000Z	jasoncohen	ed1t	it also provides the w32codecs package for divx/xvid, windows media, quicktime and realplayer codecs for xine (and totem with totem-xine, kaffeine etc)
2005-07-13T07:35:00.000Z	jasoncohen	ed1t	and it packages j2re and j2sdk
2005-07-29T12:30:00.000Z	ed1t	jasoncohen	trying to resize partitions?
2005-07-29T12:30:00.000Z	jasoncohen	ed1t	yes
2005-07-29T12:31:00.000Z	jasoncohen	ed1t	i wanted to shrink my / ext3 partition so i could make a larger swap. currently my swap is too small for hibernate
2005-07-29T12:53:00.000Z	ed1t	jasoncohen	yea but wont it delete the stuff in your / ?
2005-07-29T12:54:00.000Z	jasoncohen	ed1t	you can resize ext3 without removing data
2005-07-29T12:54:00.000Z	ed1t	jasoncohen	i didn know if you can shrink it in partitioner
2005-07-29T12:55:00.000Z	jasoncohen	ed1t	ext3 supports being resized both smaller & larger w/o losing data so long as the partition is unmounted
