2005-12-01T10:26:00.000Z	luisito		I have a question about the toolbars... how I can change the icons of the toolbar?? I have seen some GTK2.x of clearlooks in Gnome-look but I don't get those icons when I download the themes.
2005-12-01T10:26:00.000Z	burner	luisito	what toolbar?
2005-12-01T10:28:00.000Z	luisito	burner	the normal window toolbars
2005-12-01T10:28:00.000Z	burner	luisito	define "normal window toolbars"  in nautilus? firefox? gnome-panel?
2005-12-01T10:29:00.000Z	luisito	burner	sorry, nautilus toolbar
2005-12-01T10:29:00.000Z	burner	luisito	did you try changing the "icon theme" not just the gtk theme?
2005-12-01T10:31:00.000Z	luisito	burner	ok, excellent
2005-12-01T10:34:00.000Z	luisito	burner	but when I set a XFCE Gtk it change the toolbar icons but I maintain the theme of Icons I like for folders, filetypes, etc..
2005-12-01T10:35:00.000Z	burner	luisito	i think icon themes override gtk themes
2005-12-01T10:41:00.000Z	luisito	burner	I find the Icons I saw at Gnome-look, they are the Tango Project Icons, now I'm having what I saw there. :)
2005-12-01T10:41:00.000Z	burner	luisito	:)  for the record, tango is a lot more than just the icon theme from gnome-look, but whatever, if it works
2005-12-01T10:43:00.000Z	luisito	burner	man! this Icons are the best I have saw. It fits excellent with the UI.

2005-12-01T10:49:00.000Z	luisito	burner	great Desktop man! :) I like the "lookin' good" desktops, for me that is like a mania. but it has to be fast too, not weird things that make things slow the graphics like transparencies. so far I don't like transparencies because of that.
2005-12-01T10:53:00.000Z	burner	luisito	thanks :)  i appreciate a good lookin one too
2005-12-01T10:54:00.000Z	luisito	burner	why I can't change the Gnome-panel icons freely like I used to do in Hoary? I only can change the icons with the ones in /usr/share/pixmaps/      :-/  !?!?
2005-12-01T10:56:00.000Z	burner	luisito	click "browse" to find other icons ;)
2005-12-01T10:59:00.000Z	luisito	burner	no man, I do that and I can't select any other from another folder, that is the strange thing, It appears like an unavailable item wich I can't select  !?!?
2005-12-01T11:00:00.000Z	burner	luisito	u can select another 'folder' and then that folder loads the icons in it for you to click on
2005-12-01T11:04:00.000Z	luisito	burner	oh my God!!, I'm an animal, what a stupid detail I missed!!!. I loosed the touch man, I loosed the touch! :DD
2005-12-01T11:05:00.000Z	burner	luisito	don't beat yerself up over it ;)  it's all good
