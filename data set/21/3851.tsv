2008-09-08T05:33:00.000Z	Salooooomy		anyone know what shift does not work in terminal???
2008-09-08T05:33:00.000Z	dr_willis	Salooooomy	 you mean terminal as in 'gnome-terminal' or  the 'console' ?  try a different terminal app perhaps.
2008-09-08T05:34:00.000Z	Salooooomy	dr_willis	I have tried both, to no avail :(
2008-09-08T05:43:00.000Z	dr_willis	Salooooomy	 as a test. try under a different user. could be some  keyboard setting.
2008-09-08T05:44:00.000Z	Salooooomy	dr_willis	I am trying as root (I am the only user of my laptop).
2008-09-08T05:44:00.000Z	dr_willis	Salooooomy	 try as a different user.. if it works for the other users.. then that points to a setting issue.. if it never works.. that points to a hardware issue..
2008-09-08T05:45:00.000Z	Salooooomy	dr_willis	shift key works in any other apps. just not in any shell... under my user...
2008-09-08T05:46:00.000Z	dr_willis	Salooooomy	 how about under 'xterm' ?   I cant think of a setting that would affect konsole and gnome-terminal both.
2008-09-08T05:47:00.000Z	Salooooomy	dr_willis	i will try under xterm...
2008-09-08T05:49:00.000Z	Salooooomy	dr_willis	xterm exhibits same symptom, no SHIFT in that app either
2008-09-08T05:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	Salooooomy	 weirdness.. Id be tempted to try a totally different window manager like jwm , and see if it also shows the same issue.
2008-09-08T05:51:00.000Z	dr_willis	Salooooomy	 this is using KDE or GNOME as the desktop?
2008-09-08T05:57:00.000Z	dr_willis	Salooooomy	 im guessing some term setting.  but i cant imagine what one.
2008-09-08T05:58:00.000Z	dr_willis	Salooooomy	 Hmmm... IT could be compiz grabbing the key..   Debugging #1 = disable compiz and see if it stillhappens
2008-09-08T05:59:00.000Z	dr_willis	Salooooomy	 why did you mess with .bashrc to set compiz? :)  I never had to do that befor
2008-09-08T06:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	Salooooomy	 kwin --replace
2008-09-08T06:00:00.000Z	Salooooomy	dr_willis	kwin -- replace worked
2008-09-08T06:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	Salooooomy	 thats my guess also.
2008-09-08T06:01:00.000Z	Salooooomy	dr_willis	much thanks. can you suggest a way to load compiz at the start which avoids having to load another wm?
2008-09-08T06:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	Salooooomy	 i dont use compiz. so No. :)
2008-09-08T06:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	Salooooomy	 personally i thought if you did compiz --replace  it set  the kwin variable so it did NOT load kwin, then compiz.. but i dont pay much attention to it.
