2005-09-23T15:16:00.000Z	Gundjah		Whis - whaddyamean?
2005-09-23T15:16:00.000Z	Gundjah		tnx ... volvo
2005-09-23T15:18:00.000Z	Gundjah		My inittab says:
2005-09-23T15:18:00.000Z	Gundjah		# The default runlevel.
2005-09-23T15:18:00.000Z	Gundjah		id:3:initdefault:
2005-09-23T15:18:00.000Z	Gundjah		Can anyone figure out why I
2005-09-23T15:18:00.000Z	Gundjah		am booting to graph mode???
2005-09-23T15:19:00.000Z	topyli	Gundjah	debian-like distros always boot to runlevel 2. the thing you want to do is not to start gdm
2005-09-23T15:20:00.000Z	Gundjah	topyli	- AFAIK it should boot to runlevel defined in inittab. What am I missing here?
2005-09-23T15:21:00.000Z	topyli	Gundjah	i guess you are booting to runlevel 3, but it's identical to 2
2005-09-23T15:21:00.000Z	topyli	Gundjah	boot to runlevel 2 but disable gdm
2005-09-23T15:22:00.000Z	Gundjah	topyli	- runlevel 2 identical to 3????
2005-09-23T15:25:00.000Z	topyli	Gundjah	that's not a debian inittab
2005-09-23T15:25:00.000Z	topyli	Gundjah	in debian, runlevels 2-5 are identical until you customize them
2005-09-23T15:26:00.000Z	Gundjah	topyli	- nope, I got it from HOWTO.
2005-09-23T15:28:00.000Z	topyli	Gundjah	yeah, your HOWTO is talking about redhad-like distros
2005-09-23T15:32:00.000Z	Gundjah	topyli	- maybe.
2005-09-23T15:34:00.000Z	Gundjah	topyli	- got firefox installed, now I'm trying to figure out how to disable GDM, but no luck. How to?
2005-09-23T15:35:00.000Z	topyli	Gundjah	debian has update-rc.d but you have to read the man page. it's easier to install sysv-rc-conf :)
2005-09-23T15:36:00.000Z	Gundjah	topyli	- tnx :-)
