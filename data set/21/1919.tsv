2010-08-30T21:14:00.000Z	tehgeekmeister		do i need to restart cron for it to recognize new files in cron.d?
2010-08-30T21:15:00.000Z	sacarlson	tehgeekmeister	no,  enless you didn't use crontab -e
2010-08-30T21:15:00.000Z	tehgeekmeister	sacarlson	ah, so i need to run crontab -e?
2010-08-30T21:16:00.000Z	sacarlson	tehgeekmeister	only if you don't want to reboot or reset cron
2010-08-30T21:16:00.000Z	tehgeekmeister	sacarlson	well i was adding a new file to cron.d anyway, not editing crontab
2010-08-30T21:17:00.000Z	sacarlson	tehgeekmeister	well that's not the normal method,  but I guess you must know what your doing.
2010-08-30T21:17:00.000Z	tehgeekmeister	sacarlson	no, i have no clue, actually.
2010-08-30T21:18:00.000Z	tehgeekmeister	sacarlson	should i put the entry into crontab instead?
2010-08-30T21:18:00.000Z	tehgeekmeister	sacarlson	i was reverse engineering the sysstat cron file to figure out how to do mine
2010-08-30T21:18:00.000Z	sacarlson	tehgeekmeister	cron is setup so any user account can setup a timed event.  if that's what you want to do that is the normal method
2010-08-30T21:19:00.000Z	sacarlson	tehgeekmeister	 try man crontab for more info
2010-08-30T21:19:00.000Z	tehgeekmeister	sacarlson	okay, thanks
2010-08-30T21:19:00.000Z	sacarlson	tehgeekmeister	systat?
2010-08-30T21:20:00.000Z	tehgeekmeister	sacarlson	yeah, it dumps reports for sar
2010-08-30T21:20:00.000Z	sacarlson	tehgeekmeister	what account does it run in?
2010-08-30T21:20:00.000Z	tehgeekmeister	sacarlson	sysstat runs as root, think it has to
2010-08-30T21:21:00.000Z	tehgeekmeister	sacarlson	or at least i *believe* it runs as root.  if it doesn't, i don't know what account it uses.
2010-08-30T21:22:00.000Z	sacarlson	tehgeekmeister	not sure what it does or what it is.  what is it you want to do with cron or what is it you want to modify in systat?
2010-08-30T21:22:00.000Z	tehgeekmeister	sacarlson	i want a script to run right after sysstat dumps it's statistics, to send me an email if the idle percentage drops too low
2010-08-30T21:24:00.000Z	sacarlson	tehgeekmeister	if you just modify something like that just restart cron.  it should work fine.
2010-08-30T21:24:00.000Z	tehgeekmeister	sacarlson	cool, thanks
