2008-08-24T21:28:00.000Z	Gnea	Otacon22	iirc, there's a separate audio-out jack on the back of the card that you can plug into the line-in of your sound card

2008-08-24T21:29:00.000Z	Gnea	Otacon22	there isn't what? an audio cord? an audio-out port? a line-in?
2008-08-24T21:30:00.000Z	Otacon22	Gnea	there is a connector, could be an RCA female connector
2008-08-24T21:30:00.000Z	Otacon22		i can try now
2008-08-24T21:31:00.000Z	Gnea	Otacon22	no 1/8" female jack?

2008-08-24T21:32:00.000Z	Gnea	Otacon22	you mean 'which'. either.
2008-08-24T21:32:00.000Z	Otacon22	Gnea	there are 2 cards: my audio card and the tv audio card
2008-08-24T21:32:00.000Z	Otacon22	Gnea	the tv card is seen also as audio card
2008-08-24T21:33:00.000Z	Gnea	Otacon22	right, so try turning the mix on for both and see what happens.
