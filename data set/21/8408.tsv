2006-04-12T16:48:00.000Z	Flogee		Hello. So... I have NTFS partitions and I want to mount them. They are being mounted every time I log in (there are shortcuts to HDB1 etc. on the desktop) but why I try to open them it says that i have no permissions. When I sudo nautilus, it can access them. How can I make it so that I wont need to give nautilus root rights every time I read the partitions?
2006-04-12T16:49:00.000Z	Killgore	Flogee	you can change the permissions for the drive with uid=username (flogee for example)
2006-04-12T16:50:00.000Z	Killgore	Flogee	in fstab
2006-04-12T16:51:00.000Z	Flogee	Killgore	where in the fstab file am I meant to put that uid
2006-04-12T16:51:00.000Z	Killgore	Flogee	yeah, where all the rw, noauto the options
2006-04-12T16:52:00.000Z	Killgore	Flogee	see where it says defaults? put in rw,uid=flogee
2006-04-12T16:52:00.000Z	Killgore	Flogee	see where it says defaults? put in ro,uid=flogee
2006-04-12T05:07:00.000Z	Killgore	Flogee	good to hear. Did you type them in right?
2006-04-12T05:07:00.000Z	Killgore	Flogee	or are you using synaptic
2006-04-12T05:08:00.000Z	Flogee	Killgore	the apt get commands? IO copypasted them from https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats?highlight=%28restrictedformats%29
2006-04-12T05:09:00.000Z	Killgore	Flogee	better off editing your /etc/apt/sources.list
2006-04-12T05:10:00.000Z	Flogee	Killgore	okay. What line should I edit/add to get multiverse
2006-04-12T05:11:00.000Z	Killgore	Flogee	simple sudo nano (or whatever editor you wnat) /etc/apt/sources.list. at the top will be a line that is commented (ie # at the start) remove those 2 #
2006-04-12T05:11:00.000Z	Killgore	Flogee	it will have something like deb http:/multiverse....
2006-04-12T05:13:00.000Z	Flogee	Killgore	" deb http://fi.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu breezy-backports main restricted universe multiverse" (and the another line for sources) is only line containing multiverse in my list
2006-04-12T06:25:00.000Z	Killgore	Flogee	how did you install the drivers?
2006-04-12T06:25:00.000Z	Flogee	Killgore	I have followed these https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
2006-04-12T06:26:00.000Z	Killgore	Flogee	should have done this http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/get.html
2006-04-12T06:38:00.000Z	Flogee	Killgore	what if easyubuntu can't find multiverse and can't add it cause it can't find it (or something)? xD
2006-04-12T06:39:00.000Z	Killgore	Flogee	you tick the multiverse box lol
2006-04-12T06:40:00.000Z	Flogee	Killgore	I've ticked them all lol
