2012-08-07T22:15:00.000Z	[snake]		is there a way to prepend data to a file in C with fopen or anything?
2012-08-07T22:17:00.000Z	elgaton	[snake]	No, you should read the whole file, then rewrite it prepending the additional data you want to add
2012-08-07T22:17:00.000Z	[snake]	elgaton	good idea.
2012-08-08T00:03:00.000Z	[snake]	elgaton	it's not working :( reading in the file and then writing it out after my other data.
2012-08-08T00:05:00.000Z	[snake]	elgaton	somehow it's printing out the held_text (from the file originally) first and then the new stuff, but that's not the prder my fprintfs are.
2012-08-08T00:09:00.000Z	elgaton	[snake]	could you please put the code in a pastebin?
2012-08-08T00:11:00.000Z	[snake]	elgaton	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1134881/
2012-08-08T00:12:00.000Z	elgaton	[snake]	OK, I'm a little busy right now, I'll get back
2012-08-08T00:12:00.000Z	[snake]	elgaton	ok.
2012-08-08T01:53:00.000Z	elgaton	[snake]	had a look at the code, I think you need to do a rewind(fptr) before printing into the file with fprintf
2012-08-08T01:57:00.000Z	[snake]	elgaton	what does rewind() do?
2012-08-08T01:57:00.000Z	elgaton	[snake]	It sets the file pointer back to the start of the file
2012-08-08T01:59:00.000Z	[snake]	elgaton	it didn't fix it. :(
2012-08-08T02:01:00.000Z	[snake]	elgaton	now it's only posting the new data when I write stuff into it.
2012-08-08T02:01:00.000Z	elgaton	[snake]	OK, what do you want the code to do precisely?
2012-08-08T02:02:00.000Z	[snake]	elgaton	there will be a file that says(for example): hello.
2012-08-08T02:02:00.000Z	[snake]	elgaton	I want to put stuff before that like this: new data\nhello
2012-08-08T02:03:00.000Z	[snake]	elgaton	like append, but before
2012-08-08T02:05:00.000Z	elgaton	[snake]	Strange. Will have a look at it tomorrow, seems fine at a first glance
2012-08-08T02:06:00.000Z	[snake]	elgaton	I know, I think that it should work but idk...
2012-08-08T02:06:00.000Z	elgaton	[snake]	I'll have a look at it
