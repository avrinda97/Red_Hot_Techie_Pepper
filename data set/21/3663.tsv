2008-11-03T07:44:00.000Z	Spaz926	pen	When I boot Ubuntu 8.10 it works fine while booting, but after it gets done with the boot screen, all it shows is a small line at the top.
2008-11-03T07:44:00.000Z	pen	Spaz926	small line?
2008-11-03T07:46:00.000Z	Spaz926	pen	it is a small, maybe 2megapixal line, where I can put my cursor at the top and see the tip, but I don't see the rest of my screen correctly.
2008-11-03T07:47:00.000Z	pen	Spaz926	are you using 8.10?
2008-11-03T07:47:00.000Z	Spaz926	pen	yes
2008-11-03T07:47:00.000Z	pen	Spaz926	does live cd environment work?
2008-11-03T07:47:00.000Z	pen	Spaz926	can you login to new installation the first time?
2008-11-03T07:48:00.000Z	Spaz926	pen	yes, it didn't happen until I installed the nvidia driver
2008-11-03T07:48:00.000Z	pen	Spaz926	how did you install the driver?
2008-11-03T07:48:00.000Z	pen	Spaz926	and what brand is it?
2008-11-03T07:48:00.000Z	Spaz926	pen	Ubuntu put a icon in my taskbar to install it
2008-11-03T07:49:00.000Z	pen	Spaz926	so nvidia?

2008-11-03T07:49:00.000Z	pen	Spaz926	and after reboot no screen?
2008-11-03T07:50:00.000Z	Spaz926	pen	correct, I can boot into recovery mode, but when I reboot after that it goes blank again.
2008-11-03T07:51:00.000Z	pen	Spaz926	let me think
2008-11-03T07:52:00.000Z	Spaz926	pen	no problem
2008-11-03T07:58:00.000Z	Spaz926	pen	I'm gonna try what I just did, I'm going to reboot, brb
2008-11-03T08:04:00.000Z	Spaz926	pen	I didn't have to go into restore mode this time, but it says Ubuntu is running in low graphics mode. And is still in a low res
2008-11-03T08:05:00.000Z	Spaz926	pen	Nevermind on that one, I fixed the res. Let me reboot to see if this works.
