2010-01-31T07:03:00.000Z	Myke516		I have a question, how do you remove a program that was installed. I Installed google earth, and now i cant seem to uninstall it
2010-01-31T07:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Myke516	 depends on how you installed it
2010-01-31T07:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Myke516	 if you ran the installer as a user. I Think it installed to the 'googleearth' directory - If you did sudo.. no idea where it went
2010-01-31T07:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Myke516	 it might have an uninstall option. I use the repos that have googleearth
2010-01-31T07:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Myke516	 delete the diretory it made.. or rereun the installer and see if it has uninstall options
2010-01-31T07:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Myke516	 the google earth.bin is an installer.. it MIGHT have a --uninstall option
2010-01-31T07:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Myke516	 delete the diretory it installed to then.. and use the repos in the future. i guess
2010-01-31T07:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Myke516	 or chedk the google earth page for how to remove it
2010-01-31T07:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Myke516	 its not in the official ones.. its at meduibuntu i recall
2010-01-31T07:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Myke516	 you instlled it as sudo. sio its a system directory.. thus you have to do sudo rights to remove it

2010-01-31T07:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Myke516	 itsbest to learn to do root things from the terminal. Running nautilus as root is asking for trouble
2010-01-31T07:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Myke516	 and there was no need to use 'sudo' to install google earth it can install to the users home.
2010-01-31T07:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Myke516	 i just installed google earth here.. thers an uninstall script in the googleearth directory
2010-01-31T07:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Myke516	 worked fine here.
2010-01-31T07:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Myke516	 yes.. the docs/url i posted said to run it from the terminal....
2010-01-31T08:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Myke516	 install mc and use it as your root file manager.. is one way.   sudo apt-get install mc, then sudo mc
2010-01-31T08:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Myke516	 or learn more shell basics. (always a good idea)
2010-01-31T10:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Myke516	 err.. of course.
2010-01-31T10:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Myke516	 partition the hd's to leave part unallocated -  that saves time.
2010-01-31T10:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Myke516	 or use 2 seperate hard driges
