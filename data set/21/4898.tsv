2008-03-25T00:45:00.000Z	lastelement0	azexian	thats not the issue. my machine loads fine
2008-03-25T00:37:00.000Z	azexian	lastelement0	that's the reason you don't see the splash, delete the vga=* too, then you can see why it is taking so long to boot
2008-03-25T00:37:00.000Z	lastelement0	azexian	but what do i delete? don't things with # in front mean they are commented?
2008-03-25T00:38:00.000Z	azexian	lastelement0	that's right, scroll down, and you will see some without #, one is the kernel you boot, if you need more help, chuck your menu.lst in pastebin, and I will edit it for you
2008-03-25T00:39:00.000Z	lastelement0	azexian	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/60909/
2008-03-25T00:39:00.000Z	azexian	lastelement0	ok, looking now
2008-03-25T00:40:00.000Z	lastelement0	azexian	thank you
2008-03-25T00:40:00.000Z	azexian	lastelement0	ok, I have just deleted the splash line so you can see what is actually happening when you boot, pasted here: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/60910/
2008-03-25T00:41:00.000Z	lastelement0	azexian	thanks im going to reboot and see if it worke
2008-03-25T00:42:00.000Z	azexian	lastelement0	ok =)
2008-03-25T00:44:00.000Z	lastelement0	azexian	now i see a text version of the boot up. as in it shows me what is loading
2008-03-25T00:45:00.000Z	azexian	lastelement0	that's the idea, now you can see anything that is failing to load, and hanging, 2 mins is quite slow, although I never did ask the speed of your machine =)
2008-03-25T00:46:00.000Z	azexian	lastelement0	oh, my appologies, I mis read that, in that case, you will want to keep that splash line, have you changed your theme?
2008-03-25T00:46:00.000Z	lastelement0	azexian	yes i have
2008-03-25T00:47:00.000Z	azexian	lastelement0	ok, well that hasn't worked, clearly, try doing a quick test with splashy -you
2008-03-25T00:48:00.000Z	azexian	lastelement0	actually, it might not be splashy anymore
2008-03-25T00:48:00.000Z	azexian	lastelement0	that is meant to be the letter, not word, autocomplete :p
2008-03-25T00:49:00.000Z	lastelement0	azexian	not sure what you mean
2008-03-25T00:50:00.000Z	azexian	lastelement0	did you run a command to change your theme?
2008-03-25T00:50:00.000Z	lastelement0	azexian	dont really remember to be honest
2008-03-25T00:51:00.000Z	azexian	lastelement0	well you can restore the original one if you like...
