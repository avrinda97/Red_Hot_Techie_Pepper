2009-03-21T16:00:00.000Z	jrib	tarfart	why are you using dpkg to install debs?  Do you know about apt?
2009-03-21T16:01:00.000Z	tarfart	jrib	it's not in apt
2009-03-21T16:01:00.000Z	jrib	tarfart	it is in apt... apt just installs debs from the same place you got that one.  What ubuntu version are you using?
2009-03-21T16:04:00.000Z	jrib	tarfart	you are breaking your install if you are installing hardy packages on a machine that's not hardy.  Please read the link from ubottu on properly installing software
