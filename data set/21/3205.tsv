2010-07-27T17:51:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ashiswin	is gnome-volume-manager installed on your system?
2010-07-27T17:33:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ashiswin	i think if you uninstall indicator-sound it will remove the new volume and leave the mail icon.  good luck.
2010-07-27T17:39:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ashiswin	again "indicator-sound"
2010-07-27T17:40:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ashiswin	one way is "sudo apt-get remove indicator-sound", another is Synaptic or Ubuntu Software Center
2010-07-27T17:41:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ashiswin	that will remove the mail icon as well
2010-07-27T17:42:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ashiswin	then the right click remove won't work, just my uninstall command
2010-07-27T17:42:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ashiswin	s/just my/just use my
2010-07-27T17:42:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ashiswin	not my uninstall command no
2010-07-27T17:45:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ashiswin	indicator-sound is the NEW one
2010-07-27T17:46:00.000Z	ashiswin	ZykoticK9	when i ran that, it removed the default one instead of the one in the notification panel
2010-07-27T17:46:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ashiswin	sorry i thought that's what you wanted.  reinstall indictor-sound and remove the Gnome Sound one instead
2010-07-27T17:47:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ashiswin	not sure, do you remember how you added it?
2010-07-27T17:50:00.000Z	ashiswin	ZykoticK9	any luck?
2010-07-27T17:50:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ashiswin	sorry i stopped looking...
2010-07-27T17:51:00.000Z	ashiswin	ZykoticK9	Hmm, i'm not sure
2010-07-27T17:52:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ashiswin	in terminal "apt-cache policy gnome-volume-manager"
2010-07-27T17:52:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ashiswin	my 10.04 does NOT have that installed by default (or now for that matter)
2010-07-27T17:55:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ashiswin	it will probably be back after you restart...
2010-07-27T17:56:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ashiswin	try System / Preferences / Startup Applications - and see if Gnome Volume Control is listed
2010-07-27T17:57:00.000Z	ashiswin	ZykoticK9	i added a startup app with the command "killall gnome-volume-control-applet" and now it doesnt open anymore :-)
2010-07-27T17:58:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ashiswin	killall just closes a command
