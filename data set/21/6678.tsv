2007-02-19T12:09:00.000Z	Beltz		whats it for?
2007-02-19T12:11:00.000Z	Beltz		It's for very very low demand (to test apps)
2007-02-19T12:11:00.000Z	Beltz		Are some things missing in the server, that are in the desktop edition?
2007-02-19T12:12:00.000Z	Beltz		No problems, I'm just curious if there is any downside to using the server edition actually
2007-02-19T12:12:00.000Z	Beltz		Ack, no gui? Console only?
2007-02-19T12:12:00.000Z	Beltz		So as a newbie, I should go with desktop, riiiiight?
2007-02-19T12:13:00.000Z	Flannel	Beltz	if you user the server kernel with a GUI, you'll have percieved lag sometimes, because the server kernel doesn't PREEMPT
2007-02-19T12:15:00.000Z	Flannel	Beltz	Linux doesn't really differentiate between "server" and "desktop"
2007-02-19T12:16:00.000Z	Flannel	Beltz	actually, If I were you, I'd get the alternate CD.  It has two version you'll be interested in, a GUI install, and a gui-less install.
2007-02-19T12:16:00.000Z	Flannel	Beltz	for that, you'll need all three CDs.  But actually, if you're willing to sacrifice a day or whatever, you can install all three on a machine, side by side,
2007-02-19T12:17:00.000Z	Flannel	Beltz	well, it has an install option that isn't a GUI, it's not exactly the same as the full fledged "server" CD (no special kernel by default)
2007-02-19T12:17:00.000Z	Flannel	Beltz	and no LAMP preinstall
2007-02-19T12:19:00.000Z	Flannel	Beltz	but, X/K/Ubuntu can all be installed on the same machine, so its easy enough to try them out by just installing all three.  Of course,  You probably don't want to keep the machine like that (that's a lot of cruft), so you'd *probably* want to reinstall/remove two/one of them, but if you've got the space, it's no big deal
2007-02-19T12:20:00.000Z	Beltz	Flannel	Installing x/k/ubuntu requires 3 partitions though right?
2007-02-19T12:20:00.000Z	Flannel	Beltz	nope
2007-02-19T12:21:00.000Z	Flannel	Beltz	it's just like installing... uh, three web browsers on the same computer.  Only, these are 'computer browsing ... suites'
2007-02-19T12:22:00.000Z	Beltz	Flannel	Illuminate my newbiish soul: Is that because "linux" is the OS while those kde/xfce/gnome are just basic applications? So if I install kubuntu, the apps I install in it will work if I boot with xubuntu? Or something like that?
2007-02-19T12:24:00.000Z	Flannel	Beltz	"Linux" is just the kernel (thats the underlying workhorse), then there are desktop environments ontop of that (Ubuntu - gnome, Kubuntu - KDE, Xubuntu - XFCE), which are just things running ontop, that look pretty.  Of course, U/X/Kubuntu instlal a bunch of other software too (not JUST the bare window managers, but all the stuff that goes with them, text editor, word processor, web browsers, etc)
2007-02-19T12:24:00.000Z	Flannel	Beltz	even the console runs as "just" a program ontop of the kernel
2007-02-19T12:25:00.000Z	Flannel	Beltz	they'd just take up harddrive space
2007-02-19T12:29:00.000Z	Flannel	Beltz	the one thing you'll run into (or at least, I did... ages ago), is that with Kubuntu and Ubuntu installed (or whatever) your menus are full of stuff from the other environment (which is perfectly fine to run, but not ideal)
