2006-08-01T10:13:00.000Z	zerium		hi all, for some reason my configuring network interfaces hangs and then when I hit ctrl-c to skip the desktop never comes up, just gives me a cursor and a brown screen
2006-08-01T10:13:00.000Z	stefg	zerium	is this a dhcp related problem?
2006-08-01T10:14:00.000Z	zerium	stefg	it seems when i turn on auto (ethX) it does it... when i turn it off on the device its fine and then when i go into networking and click activate it works...
2006-08-01T10:15:00.000Z	zerium	stefg	but, i'd like to have non sudoers have internet access....
2006-08-01T10:15:00.000Z	stefg	zerium	you're behind a router, using NAT i assume?
2006-08-01T10:15:00.000Z	zerium	stefg	yeah
2006-08-01T10:16:00.000Z	stefg	zerium	so anyone has net-access anyway... the router does the 'dialing'
2006-08-01T10:16:00.000Z	zerium	stefg	yes
2006-08-01T10:16:00.000Z	zerium	stefg	its cable... so always on (hooked through a router)
2006-08-01T10:17:00.000Z	stefg	zerium	it might be the router being lazy in issuing a dhcp lease ...
2006-08-01T10:17:00.000Z	zerium		it does it even when i set it up as static
2006-08-01T10:17:00.000Z	stefg	zerium	is it a _router_ or a _cable-modem_ ?
2006-08-01T10:18:00.000Z	zerium	stefg	router
2006-08-01T10:19:00.000Z	stefg	zerium	so the chain goes like cable modem->router->Computer
2006-08-01T10:19:00.000Z	zerium	stefg	yeah, works fine, it think its the wifi card...
2006-08-01T10:19:00.000Z	stefg		Maybe router and modem are built into the same case
2006-08-01T10:20:00.000Z	zerium		:stefg no, i have a physical router, and a physical cable modem
2006-08-01T10:21:00.000Z	stefg	zerium	so I'd check the wireless howto for tips or known issues, and possibly try to have fixed IPs on the LAN. This is required anywayif you need to forward ports through the NAT for filesharing etc.
2006-08-01T10:22:00.000Z	stefg		!blacklist
2006-08-01T10:23:00.000Z	zerium		:stefg ok, so how do i setup my box to automatically enable the card with a static ip?
2006-08-01T10:24:00.000Z	stefg	zerium	static ip is done in the gnom network manager (System-Admin-network). how to get your specific card going: see !wifi
