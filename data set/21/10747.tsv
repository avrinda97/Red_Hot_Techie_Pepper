2004-11-29T10:45:00.000Z	ermo	daniels	ack
2004-12-02T07:12:00.000Z	ermo	daniels	x300? But that's basically an RV3xx core, isn't it?
2004-12-02T07:13:00.000Z	daniels	ermo	aiui x300 is an r4xx, but i may be wrong
2004-12-02T07:22:00.000Z	ermo	daniels	(was curious) <quote>The Radeon X300 is the PCI Express version of the Radeon 9550.</quote>
2004-12-02T07:23:00.000Z	daniels	ermo	ah.  in other words, total crap. :)
2004-12-02T07:23:00.000Z	ermo	daniels	probably. I bought a 9250 to be able to use the open source dri drivers. Excellent image quality...
2004-12-02T07:24:00.000Z	ermo	daniels	also, the X600 is basically a souped up RV360 and some extra features (not mentioned in the article I'm reading)
2004-12-02T07:25:00.000Z	daniels	ermo	yeah
2004-12-02T07:26:00.000Z	daniels	ermo	iirc the x800 (r423) is the really interesting one in terms of new tech
2004-12-02T07:26:00.000Z	ermo	daniels	sure is. But I was thinking in terms of what hardware could reasonably be expected to be supported under X
2004-12-02T07:27:00.000Z	ermo	daniels	By extension, I would tend to belive that x300 and x600 /should/ work with the ati-drivers.
2004-12-02T07:27:00.000Z	ermo	daniels	Off course, I have no hard evidence to back up that claim.
2004-12-02T07:27:00.000Z	daniels	ermo	er, we have full 2d support for r4xx, y'know
2004-12-02T07:27:00.000Z	ermo	daniels	so it's just 3d?
2004-12-02T07:27:00.000Z	daniels	ermo	there's 2d support for every ati card on the market
2004-12-02T07:28:00.000Z	ermo	daniels	but it's still via the ati binary drivers, isn't it?
2004-12-02T07:28:00.000Z	daniels	ermo	3d?  or 2d?
2004-12-02T07:29:00.000Z	ermo	daniels	I'm not making sense, sorry. I was referring to your prior quip to tyrano: tyrano: because unless you have a really, really, really new card (r4xx -- anything starting with an x, e.g. x300, x400, x600
2004-12-02T07:29:00.000Z	daniels	ermo	oh, right
2004-12-02T07:30:00.000Z	ermo	daniels	and so was just trying to elaborate on x300 and x600
