2005-02-04T09:15:00.000Z	kent	neighborlee	is yours to high, or?  mine is at 20-40 % right now, but im having 8 bittorrent downloads with bittornade running (and other applications such as epiphany, xchat, gaim etc).
2005-02-04T09:15:00.000Z	neighborlee	kent	my settles in at about 25%....with only xchat and gnome terminal running along with gnome monitor
2005-02-04T09:16:00.000Z	kent	neighborlee	and you are sure you have not set gnome monitor to update every 0.5 seconds or something? otherwise it seems like a to high figure :(
2005-02-04T09:17:00.000Z	neighborlee	kent	nope i've not changed any settings there
2005-02-04T09:17:00.000Z	kent	neighborlee	what process is taking so much?
2005-02-04T09:17:00.000Z	neighborlee	kent	wish I knew
2005-02-04T09:19:00.000Z	kent	neighborlee	change to show all processes, and then you should have a columns for % of cpu in the list. (hopefully, i am running Hoary the unstable branch of Ubuntu so it might have changed)
2005-02-04T09:23:00.000Z	neighborlee	kent	yeah i've got all processes and X spikes sometimes to 20% or so....no idea whats causing it as its doing it with both 2.6.10 and 2.6.8 kernels so that isn't it...using warty btw
2005-02-04T09:24:00.000Z	kent	neighborlee	have you installed either nvidia och ati's drivers for 3d? if so, try to remove them and see if it continues..?
2005-02-04T09:24:00.000Z	neighborlee	kent	either I try upgrading to hoary or I reinstall I guess ;(
2005-02-04T09:25:00.000Z	neighborlee	kent	yes I use nvidia....6111
2005-02-04T09:25:00.000Z	kent	neighborlee	if you choose to either reinstall or upgrade, i would first spend some time upgrading. it might help, and for me Hoary now is stable (but there is no guerantee..)
2005-02-04T09:25:00.000Z	neighborlee	kent	8 bittorrents eh ;-)...busy man heh
2005-02-04T09:25:00.000Z	neighborlee	kent	yup exactly
2005-02-04T09:26:00.000Z	neighborlee	kent	its tempting yes...I just fear after threee hours I might be left with unuseable system anyway LOL..shrug
2005-02-04T09:27:00.000Z	neighborlee	kent	so after upgrade you still could login to desktop
2005-02-04T09:27:00.000Z	kent	neighborlee	i would actually try to remove the nvidia driver first if i was you.  That might help. Just remove the package, and make *sure* you are not loading the nvidia kernel-module, and that you use "nv" and not "nvidia" as the driver for X. (if you know howto,..?)
2005-02-04T09:28:00.000Z	kent	neighborlee	yes. but i could not use the nvidia driver. I dont know why, but X gets crazy then. I have an old tnt2-card, so i dont get much 3d anyway so i dont mind using the free driver.
2005-02-04T09:29:00.000Z	neighborlee	kent	I suppose its worth a shot...nv would be okay for a test yes
2005-02-04T09:29:00.000Z	kent	neighborlee	since it seems like its X that causes the CPU overload (if i read correctly) i would start with the drivers for X :)
2005-03-09T13:11:00.000Z	kent	neighborlee	did you meen that you was hoping for a gui to format floppys? if so, there is one.
