2010-10-19T19:30:00.000Z	unsober		okay, can someone clue me in? I found this in my 3rd party sourc list, and I have no idea what software this might be for.   http://ppa.launchpad.net/ssakar/ppa/ubuntu
2010-10-19T19:30:00.000Z	unsober		any clue at all?!
2010-10-19T19:31:00.000Z	unsober		i'm a newbie and don't know if i should delete that entry or not
2010-10-19T19:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unsober	If your newbie, why are you adding ppas already?
2010-10-19T19:34:00.000Z	unsober	sebsebseb	i added it for something i needed weeks ago, and i do not know what it is there for now.
2010-10-19T19:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unsober	is the program still installed?
2010-10-19T19:36:00.000Z	unsober	sebsebseb	I have no idea what program it is. that was my initial question.......... How would I be able to find out?
2010-10-19T19:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unsober	you installed a ppa, and you don't even know what it is for?
2010-10-19T19:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unsober	system > administration > synaptic package manager
2010-10-19T19:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unsober	search for it read description
2010-10-19T19:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unsober	or maybe its already in the repo
2010-10-19T19:38:00.000Z	unsober	sebsebseb	I have no idea what I'm supposed to be searching for. all I have is this URI to go by in my source list: http://ppa.launchpad.net/ssakar/ppa/ubuntu
2010-10-19T19:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unsober	search for it in Synatpic read description
2010-10-19T19:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unsober	search for the name of the program
2010-10-19T19:39:00.000Z	unsober	sebsebseb	if the URI is http://ppa.launchpad.net/ssakar/ppa/ubuntu  , would the package name usually be "ssakar"?  because that's not finding anything at all... I guess I should just delete that entry
2010-10-19T19:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unsober	lets find out what it is hmm
2010-10-19T19:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unsober	and I guess the link willl tell us that
2010-10-19T19:41:00.000Z	unsober	sebsebseb	I'm sure I knew exactly what it was for at the time of installing, I just don't remember. I just recently upgraded to 10.10, so I was going through source list
2010-10-19T19:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unsober	sudo apt-get purge name of program
2010-10-19T19:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unsober	that will remove it properly if its installed
2010-10-19T19:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	unsober	and then you can also remove the ppa entry
