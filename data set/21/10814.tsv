2005-06-04T16:31:00.000Z	newbie		does anyone know why ?
2005-06-04T16:31:00.000Z	newbie		dunno, let's see ;)
2005-06-04T16:31:00.000Z	newbie		anyway, I still can't install xmms and still don't know how to
2005-06-04T16:33:00.000Z	newbie		I need to paste what console wrote
2005-06-04T16:33:00.000Z	thoreauputic	newbie	or pastebin.ubuntu.com
2005-06-04T05:04:00.000Z	thoreauputic	newbie	the new wallpaper will be in the wallpaper chooser dialog
2005-06-04T09:44:00.000Z	thoreauputic	newbie	you can paste your errors on pastebin.ubuntu.com and give us the url
2005-06-23T16:56:00.000Z	thoreauputic	newbie	I think you need to rephrase your question: what's wrong with using NIS ?
2005-06-26T14:59:00.000Z	thoreauputic	newbie	people's experiences vary - som ewould say the opposite
2005-06-26T15:00:00.000Z	thoreauputic	newbie	on my box, kde feels quicker - but I prefer fluxbox anyway :)
2005-06-26T15:01:00.000Z	thoreauputic	newbie	umm - compilers have absolutely nothing to do with desktops
2005-06-26T15:01:00.000Z	thoreauputic	newbie	anjuta
2005-06-26T15:03:00.000Z	thoreauputic	newbie	the windows registry is a rat's nest of stupid design
2005-06-26T15:55:00.000Z	thoreauputic	newbie	no, it doesn't suck for personall use
2005-06-26T15:56:00.000Z	thoreauputic	newbie	on what basis do you think it sucks?
2005-06-26T15:56:00.000Z	newbie	thoreauputic	I rather use dpkg-deb
2005-06-26T15:56:00.000Z	thoreauputic	newbie	of course - but sometimes you want source that isn't in the repos
2006-04-14T08:06:00.000Z	thoreauputic	newbie	read the ubotu link above
