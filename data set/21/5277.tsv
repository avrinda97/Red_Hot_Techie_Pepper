2007-11-20T19:53:00.000Z	ehird1		anyone know about grub error 18?
2007-11-20T19:53:00.000Z	Slart	ehird1	yes.. it's one of the most asked questions here.. sadly I can't remember any good answers to it..
2007-11-20T19:54:00.000Z	ehird1	Slart	well if ubuntu didn't crash about 3 times (literally) in a row for no reason this wouldn't have happened :P
2007-11-20T19:54:00.000Z	Slart	ehird1	hehe.. I think error 18 might be about grub not finding files or partitions it's supposed to boot from
2007-11-20T19:55:00.000Z	ehird1	Slart	no, the files are fine and there
2007-11-20T19:55:00.000Z	Slart	ehird1	then perhaps the disks have switched places for some reason? new partition somewhere?
2007-11-20T19:56:00.000Z	ehird1	Slart	no! it just crashed - 3 times - and then this happened
2007-11-20T19:57:00.000Z	Slart	ehird1	and all your drives are still working?
2007-11-20T19:58:00.000Z	ehird1	Slart	of course. i'm talking to you from windows.
2007-11-20T19:58:00.000Z	Slart	ehird1	well.. then it's the "pizza way".. buy your local linux-guru a pizza and say he can have it after he fixes your computer ;)
2007-11-20T19:59:00.000Z	ehird1	Slart	local linux guru? you overestimate this place :-)
2007-11-20T20:00:00.000Z	Slart	ehird1	if I were you I'd boot from a live cd and do the steps described in setting up grub.. ie set boot drive, grub setup etc etc.. it's a little bit like the old "reboot, reinstall"-solution but it's all I've got to offer
2007-11-20T20:01:00.000Z	ehird1	Slart	:/ i guess
2007-11-20T20:02:00.000Z	Slart	ehird1	here's a good page to read for suggestions.. http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?t=122656&highlight=grub+error+collection
2007-11-20T20:02:00.000Z	ehird1	Slart	gosh, gentoo... any cflags twiddling in there before i click? ;)
2007-11-20T20:02:00.000Z	Slart	ehird1	no cflags.. just lots of grub errors (and lots of.. yes I know you *think* you did.. but did you really ?..) =)
2007-11-20T20:03:00.000Z	ehird1	Slart	think i did what i really what.
2007-11-20T20:03:00.000Z	Slart	ehird1	look further down.. it can also be about bios detecting disks in another order than grub
2007-11-20T20:03:00.000Z	ehird1	Slart	i'm 100% sure it's right
2007-11-20T20:05:00.000Z	Slart	ehird1	my guess is something broke in your boot process.. bios resetting something.. some grub files broken.. disks resetting.. something that made the system not finding the boot drives, boot files etc
