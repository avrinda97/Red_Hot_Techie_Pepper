2007-10-11T07:30:00.000Z	RvGaTe^work		anyone ?
2007-10-11T07:31:00.000Z	soundray	RvGaTe^work	have you tried the Safe Graphics boot option?
2007-10-11T07:31:00.000Z	RvGaTe^work	soundray	yes, same problem
2007-10-11T07:33:00.000Z	RvGaTe^work	soundray	any ideas ?
2007-10-11T07:34:00.000Z	soundray	RvGaTe^work	one way would be to install in text mode using the alternate CD. Afterwards you can change the graphics driver to intel with 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'.
2007-10-11T07:35:00.000Z	RvGaTe^work	soundray	so the ati drivers wont work? it has an ati gfx card integrated...
2007-10-11T07:37:00.000Z	soundray	RvGaTe^work	oh, you've got the version with the ATI card.
2007-10-11T07:39:00.000Z	soundray	RvGaTe^work	you could also boot as far as it goes, then switch to console mode with Ctrl-Alt-F2. From there you can reconfigure X like I said -- try both the VESA and the ATI drivers. Restart X with sudo invoke-rc.d gdm restart
2007-10-11T07:40:00.000Z	RvGaTe^work	soundray	trying to start the installer... there is nothing to boot... so im downloading the alternative installer first
2007-10-11T07:40:00.000Z	soundray	RvGaTe^work	hold on
2007-10-11T07:41:00.000Z	soundray	RvGaTe^work	your installer boots fine, it's just X that won't start. So do as I said, boot the CD as far as it will go and try to get a command line.
2007-10-11T07:47:00.000Z	RvGaTe^work	soundray	same thing after the reconfigure...
2007-10-11T07:47:00.000Z	soundray	RvGaTe^work	what did you do after the reconfigure?
2007-10-11T07:47:00.000Z	RvGaTe^work	soundray	i tried to put in the values as far as i know, and selected the vesa driver
2007-10-11T07:48:00.000Z	soundray	RvGaTe^work	and when you were done with the configuration, how did you restart X?
2007-10-11T07:49:00.000Z	RvGaTe^work	soundray	please... im not stupid, im a good reader... i used the stuff you said
2007-10-11T07:49:00.000Z	soundray	RvGaTe^work	I can't make that assumption before I know you :)
2007-10-11T07:50:00.000Z	RvGaTe^work	soundray	now you know :)
2007-10-11T07:51:00.000Z	RvGaTe^work	soundray	i normally use debian for servers, at home i use debian aswell, and my collegue wants to have ubuntu on his laptop (to try out beryl and stuff) so i offered him a hand... just a pain in the ass if the auto detection of the screen doesn't work...
2007-10-11T07:52:00.000Z	soundray	RvGaTe^work	I think your best option is to get the alternate CD. Then you can at least install a CLI-based system. Maybe the graphics will even work "out of the box" after an alternate install.
2007-10-11T07:53:00.000Z	RvGaTe^work	soundray	will try that.. burning the cd as we speak
