2009-06-13T23:50:00.000Z	Neji123		I cant get my sound to work in ubuntu to play mp3 files and stuff, I know the sound works cause I can hear it when i log out, but not on movies or youtube or anything. Anyone know what may be causing this, and possible fix?
2009-06-13T23:50:00.000Z	webpigeon_laptop	Neji123	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras
2009-06-14T00:14:00.000Z	webpigeon_laptop	Neji123	means they are testing whatever driver your looking at and they've put it in an unstable banch for testing
2009-06-14T00:14:00.000Z	webpigeon_laptop	Neji123	if your insane, you could compile the driver :P
2009-06-14T00:17:00.000Z	webpigeon_laptop	Neji123	did you install ubuntu restricted extras?
2009-06-14T00:18:00.000Z	webpigeon_laptop	Neji123	do you get an error message or anything?
2009-06-14T00:20:00.000Z	Neji123	webpigeon_laptop	what info do you need?
2009-06-14T00:21:00.000Z	webpigeon_laptop	Neji123	run dmesg in terminal, it'll display anything important

2009-06-14T00:26:00.000Z	webpigeon_laptop	Neji123	there isn't anything in there that would make me think the sound isn't working :/
2009-06-14T00:32:00.000Z	Neji123	webpigeon_laptop	I got it to work, I changed it from (ALSA) to (OSS)
2009-06-14T00:32:00.000Z	webpigeon_laptop	Neji123	er, oss is kinda old...
2009-06-14T00:33:00.000Z	webpigeon_laptop	Neji123	tried using pulseaudio? (which sits ontop of alsa :P)
2009-06-14T00:35:00.000Z	Neji123	webpigeon_laptop	the error I get with alsa is: audiotestsrc wave=sine freq=512 ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! gconfaudiosink profile=music: Kunde inte öppna ljudenheten för uppspelning.
2009-06-14T00:35:00.000Z	webpigeon_laptop	Neji123	its a generic error which means it can't open the audio device
2009-06-14T00:38:00.000Z	Neji123	webpigeon_laptop	do you know what may be causing it? and what I can do to make it work?
2009-06-14T00:39:00.000Z	webpigeon_laptop	Neji123	all kinds of things might be reposible :(
2009-06-14T00:39:00.000Z	Neji123	webpigeon_laptop	oh :(
2009-06-14T00:40:00.000Z	webpigeon_laptop	Neji123	try changing the setting to pulseaudio though, if it works thats the best possible option to use
2009-06-14T00:40:00.000Z	Neji123	webpigeon_laptop	cant hear anything with pulseaudio, tried everything on the list OSS is the only thing that works :s
2009-06-14T00:40:00.000Z	webpigeon_laptop	Neji123	okay
