2010-03-04T07:03:00.000Z	Merritt	dewente	If you want to connect to suse FROM windows, use NX
2010-03-04T07:03:00.000Z	dewente	Merritt	did you try it? it worked out for you?
2010-03-04T07:03:00.000Z	Merritt	dewente	I run all openSUSE boxes, and I run NX on all of them for remote control
2010-03-04T07:04:00.000Z	dewente	Merritt	that sounds good, give me how to or tutorial to test it out please
2010-03-04T07:05:00.000Z	Merritt	dewente	I don't know where a tutorial would be. Basically you need to download (on suse) all the packages from the nomachine site: server, node, client. download the .rpm packages. then use a console to navigate to where they were downloaded and as root do: zypper in <package> and zypper will handle it for you. Do that for all 3 packages. Then all you need do is use the Client from windows
2010-03-04T07:06:00.000Z	dewente	Merritt	let me show you some that i found

2010-03-04T07:06:00.000Z	Merritt	dewente	remember to consider router port forwarding and firewalls if those might be pertinent :)
2010-03-04T07:07:00.000Z	dewente		got you
2010-03-04T07:07:00.000Z	Merritt	dewente	Don't bother using FreeNX, go to http://www.nomachine.com/select-package.php?os=linux&id=1 and get the real thing
2010-03-04T07:08:00.000Z	Merritt	dewente	NoMachine NX is alot easier to set up
2010-03-04T07:08:00.000Z	dewente	Merritt	so should i google for nomache nx instead !
2010-03-04T07:08:00.000Z	Merritt	dewente	http://www.nomachine.com/select-package.php?os=linux&id=1
