2008-11-10T03:39:00.000Z	Slart	augie	sounds like an xp problem..ubuntu might have done something bad to the windows drive.. but ubuntu can't really fix it
2008-11-10T03:40:00.000Z	augie	Slart	it's something to do with the boot.ini
2008-11-10T03:40:00.000Z	Slart	augie	well.. ask in ##windows .. you'll get better answers and won't get teased as much =)
2008-11-10T03:41:00.000Z	augie	Slart	if my xp is on sda2, should it be hda(0,1) or (0,2) in grub's menu.lst?
2008-11-10T03:42:00.000Z	Slart	augie	I'd say hda(0,1)
