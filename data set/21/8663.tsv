2006-07-19T07:43:00.000Z	ardchoille	Enverex	Not uless you plan to upgrade to the next Ubuntu version. I removed that meta package a while ago and everything is fine
2006-07-19T07:44:00.000Z	Enverex	ardchoille	why would I not be able to upgrade?
2006-07-19T07:44:00.000Z	ardchoille	Enverex	You just need to re-install ubuntu-desktop , then upgrade
2006-07-19T07:45:00.000Z	Enverex	ardchoille	Ah, what happens if it isn't installed when I upgrade or will it just not let me?
2006-07-19T07:45:00.000Z	ardchoille	Enverex	Not sure, never tried
2006-07-20T15:23:00.000Z	ardchoille	Enverex	When you open synaptic and hit the reload button, usually there will be a new entry like "New in repositories"
2006-07-20T15:24:00.000Z	Enverex	ardchoille	erm, where will that new entry be?
2006-07-20T15:25:00.000Z	ardchoille	Enverex	Hit the Status button at the bottom and it will be in with the Install, Not Installed, stuff
2006-07-20T15:26:00.000Z	Enverex	ardchoille	Only has All, Installed, Installed (local or obsolete), Not Installed, Not Installed (residual config)
2006-07-20T15:27:00.000Z	ardchoille	Enverex	Yes, that is the right sectin.. on mine it shows up there *if* there are new apps in the repos
2006-07-20T15:27:00.000Z	Enverex	ardchoille	Ah, erm, I kinda want a list of stuff like, added by date though... heh
2006-07-20T15:46:00.000Z	Enverex	ardchoille	pff, I was hacking Amigas at 6
2006-07-25T09:49:00.000Z	Enverex	ardchoille	Doesn't work for me
2006-07-25T09:49:00.000Z	Enverex	ardchoille	Evolution and Firefox both clear the clipboard for me
2006-07-25T09:54:00.000Z	Enverex	ardchoille	Any idea why klipper makes a little window for its systray icon rather than going into the REAL systray?
2006-07-25T09:55:00.000Z	ardchoille	Enverex	No idea, I don't use kde apps
2006-07-25T10:00:00.000Z	ardchoille	Enverex	, gnomefreak , minerale , See the section "Clipboard" here:  http://www.gnome.org/start/2.12/notes/en/rnusers.html
2006-07-25T10:01:00.000Z	Enverex	ardchoille	Well no matter what it says, it still doesn't work
2006-07-25T10:02:00.000Z	ardchoille	Enverex	That would make me think that your gnome is somehow broken.
2006-07-25T10:02:00.000Z	Enverex	ardchoille	and most other people in this channel apparently, and my other PC....
2006-07-25T10:05:00.000Z	Enverex	ardchoille	Evolution does it too. I think that IS part of Gnome
