2005-11-29T15:04:00.000Z	sklav		do kernels get updated thew apt-get by doing an upgrade?
2005-11-29T15:05:00.000Z	sklav		i see some people are running 2.6.12-10
2005-11-29T15:05:00.000Z	sklav		and im at 2.6.12-9
2005-11-29T15:05:00.000Z	sklav		linux terminal server project = LTSP
2005-11-29T15:07:00.000Z	sklav		ok using apt how can one see what updates are available without having to install them?
2005-11-29T15:08:00.000Z	sklav		hda and hdb?
2005-11-29T15:08:00.000Z	cafuego	sklav	2.6.12-9 -> 2.6.12-10 was an automatic upgrade.
2005-11-29T15:08:00.000Z	cafuego	sklav	It had security fixes and you should have it too
2005-11-29T15:09:00.000Z	cafuego	sklav	Enable the breezy-security and breezy-updates repositories.
2005-11-29T15:11:00.000Z	sklav	cafuego	what do you issue for a kernel update? is it in an exempt list?
2005-11-29T15:12:00.000Z	cafuego	sklav	You install a NEW ernel if it's a version upgrade, security ones are automatic.
2005-11-29T15:22:00.000Z	sklav	cafuego	the only way i see the newer kernel is if i do apt-get install linux
2005-11-29T15:31:00.000Z	cafuego	sklav	You can marginally improve performance by picking a kernel suited to your cpu as well (as opposed to the generic 386 kernel)
2005-11-29T15:31:00.000Z	sklav	cafuego	i have a sempron 3200+
2005-11-29T15:32:00.000Z	cafuego	sklav	So a -k7 kernel then :-)
2005-12-19T09:38:00.000Z	cafuego	sklav	You can do the 'server' install and then add packages as needed.
2005-12-19T09:39:00.000Z	sklav	cafuego	my issue is im not familiar with deb packaging
2005-12-19T10:25:00.000Z	sklav	cafuego	care to write an article on a proof of concept
2005-12-19T10:25:00.000Z	cafuego	sklav	Ugh, sounds like work.
2006-01-03T09:30:00.000Z	cafuego	sklav	/nick lazy
2006-01-13T15:57:00.000Z	cafuego	sklav	modprobe is far better. In fact, don't run 'isnmod'.
