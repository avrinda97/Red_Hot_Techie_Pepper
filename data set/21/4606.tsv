2008-03-22T06:33:00.000Z	poseidon		Whats that partitioner for windows? nietin booten?
2008-03-22T06:34:00.000Z	poseidon		I want to shrink my windows partition so I can install ubuntu
2008-03-22T06:34:00.000Z	efirewic2	poseidon	you can download gparted iso from download.com
2008-03-22T06:34:00.000Z	poseidon	efirewic2	whatis gparted?
2008-03-22T06:35:00.000Z	efirewic2	poseidon	a good partition editor
2008-03-22T06:35:00.000Z	poseidon		O, if I use the partitioner that is on the live cd to shrink my windows partition, will that affect it?
2008-03-22T06:36:00.000Z	poseidon		It gives me the choice of using x amount of a partiton.  Does it auto shrink it before it uses it?
2008-03-22T06:37:00.000Z	efirewic2	poseidon	if you have enough free space aval. windows likes to be in the front of the drive, then ext3 then your swap.  I would back up everything if you are not familiar/ comfortable doing this
2008-03-22T06:38:00.000Z	poseidon	efirewic2	so will the partition manager on the livecd work, or should I use gparted?
2008-03-22T06:38:00.000Z	efirewic2	poseidon	gparted is the one live uses.
2008-03-22T06:39:00.000Z	poseidon	efirewic2	k.  Then I'll use that.  Last time I tried to do it, it did hang up though, could that just have been a bug?
2008-03-22T06:39:00.000Z	efirewic2	poseidon	what is your sys specs?
2008-03-22T06:39:00.000Z	poseidon		When I clicked for it to partition the disk and begin the install, the window just left, and I had to do a full system re-isntall
2008-03-22T06:40:00.000Z	poseidon		I have a gig of ram, and 160 gb hard drive
2008-03-22T06:40:00.000Z	efirewic2	poseidon	win xp?
2008-03-22T06:40:00.000Z	poseidon		sp2 yes
2008-03-22T06:40:00.000Z	efirewic2	poseidon	desktop?
2008-03-22T06:40:00.000Z	poseidon		yes
2008-03-22T06:43:00.000Z	poseidon	efirewic2	so should I try the installation again?
2008-03-22T06:43:00.000Z	efirewic2	poseidon	well, what I would do is download the gparted iso file burn it, then boot off it. Create your partitions, after your done make your ntfs hidden and unmark it for boot. boot your live cd and you should be able to install ubuntu.
2008-03-22T06:45:00.000Z	efirewic2	poseidon	you will then have to unmark hidden when your done installing everything for windows to work again, but in the end even your grub should be correct without manually editing anything.
