2005-06-25T13:36:00.000Z	r0d		i code in vb and vb6 isnt a "true" compling lang
2005-06-25T13:36:00.000Z	r0d		vb.net is
2005-06-25T13:36:00.000Z	r0d		but thats the past right cary;)
2005-06-25T13:37:00.000Z	HawkeVIPER	r0d	one could argue whether VB is code or script
2005-06-25T13:39:00.000Z	r0d	HawkeVIPER	 I would say script more than true code. the only traces of vb6 now are what are used for scripting. (vbscript)
2005-06-25T13:40:00.000Z	HawkeVIPER	r0d	indeed
2005-06-25T13:56:00.000Z	HawkeVIPER	r0d	it's not supposed to...
2005-06-25T13:56:00.000Z	r0d	HawkeVIPER	 theirs a hack that does make it.
2005-06-25T13:56:00.000Z	HawkeVIPER	r0d	mmm, check the gimp site
2005-06-25T13:56:00.000Z	r0d	HawkeVIPER	 right. I'm wondering user feedback guess no one uses it
2005-06-25T13:57:00.000Z	HawkeVIPER	r0d	I don't tend to use gimp all that much
2005-06-25T13:57:00.000Z	r0d	HawkeVIPER	 it would be one less reason to use windows
2005-06-25T13:58:00.000Z	r0d	HawkeVIPER	 same here. I administer a window network:(
2005-06-25T13:59:00.000Z	HawkeVIPER	r0d	sucky for you... at least in my job, I'm primarily a linux admin
2005-06-25T14:00:00.000Z	r0d	HawkeVIPER	 that is a downer
2005-06-25T14:01:00.000Z	HawkeVIPER	r0d	indeed

2005-06-25T14:14:00.000Z	HawkeVIPER	r0d	back in the day before the internet... Bulletin Boards were huge, 9600baud was a modem speed, roughly 1/4 the speed of 28.8
