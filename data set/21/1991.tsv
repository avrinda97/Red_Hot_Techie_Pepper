2010-04-03T12:35:00.000Z	theadmin	LincoN^	Why not a dual-boot then?
2010-04-03T12:36:00.000Z	LincoN^	theadmin	i think i have to small drive
2010-04-03T12:36:00.000Z	theadmin	LincoN^	See the link i gave to nishanth above, http://ubuntutotalnoob.blogspot.com/2010/03/getting-dual-boot-with-windows.html
2010-04-03T12:37:00.000Z	LincoN^	theadmin	so it works with 80(74Gb) drive?
2010-04-03T12:38:00.000Z	theadmin	LincoN^	I have 2 partitions there, 40 GB Windows, 39 GB Linux and 1GB linux-swap
2010-04-03T12:39:00.000Z	LincoN^	theadmin	is it easy to fix partions?
2010-04-03T12:39:00.000Z	theadmin	LincoN^	Depends on your skill. For me, it was simple. For others, might be hard
2010-04-03T12:40:00.000Z	LincoN^	theadmin	skill on what? computers, linux, partions?
2010-04-03T12:40:00.000Z	theadmin	LincoN^	Well, basic stuff. If you ever twinkled around with partition tables before, you will find GParted very simple to use
2010-04-03T12:42:00.000Z	theadmin	LincoN^	You don't need to delete ANYTHING, GParted can resize without damaging the data!
2010-04-03T12:45:00.000Z	theadmin	LincoN^	How well i understand you :( You know, running my favorite games (HL2, Portal, etc) on Ubuntu is hardly possible.
2010-04-03T12:45:00.000Z	LincoN^	theadmin	can u help me partion?
2010-04-03T12:46:00.000Z	theadmin	LincoN^	Most definetly yes. Do you have a LiveCD? If so, boot from it and come here again.
2010-04-03T12:46:00.000Z	theadmin	LincoN^	Oh, you haz bad CD then.
2010-04-03T12:46:00.000Z	LincoN^	theadmin	ok. let see if it works :)
2010-04-03T12:47:00.000Z	theadmin	LincoN^	Uh, downloading Windows is not legal.
