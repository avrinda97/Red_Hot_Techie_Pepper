2006-01-08T09:58:00.000Z	chun_		hi all
2006-01-08T09:59:00.000Z	chun_		erm, i just installed ubuntu and for some reason, the network didn't start at boot, any idea?
2006-01-08T09:59:00.000Z	chun_		i mean, i can get connected by doing sudo dhclient eth0
2006-01-08T10:01:00.000Z	chun_		i am also looking for the command(gnome-whatever) to lauch the gui for setting up network, anyone knows?
2006-01-08T10:01:00.000Z	chun_		i have tried almost every thing that starts with gnome-xxxxxx
2006-01-08T10:03:00.000Z	SEJeff	chun_	gksudo network-admin
2006-01-08T10:03:00.000Z	SEJeff	chun_	Here is how I found out... Use the menu editor to edit System --> Administration --> Networking and looked at the properties. That was it
2006-01-08T10:05:00.000Z	chun_	SEJeff	yeah, i tried that, but i didn't see the properties options, its weird...
2006-01-08T10:05:00.000Z	SEJeff	chun_	I use dapper, so it is a different version of the menu editor
2006-01-08T10:06:00.000Z	chun_	SEJeff	i see
2006-01-08T10:07:00.000Z	SEJeff	chun_	No /etc/init.d/networking is the only script
2006-01-08T10:07:00.000Z	SEJeff	chun_	use sudo ifup eth0 or sudo ifdown eth0. That is probably what you want to do
2006-01-08T10:08:00.000Z	chun_	SEJeff	yes, but i would like to have ifup eth0 start at boot, so i don't have to type everytime for reboot
2006-01-08T10:08:00.000Z	chun_	SEJeff	i mean, automatically
2006-01-08T10:08:00.000Z	SEJeff	chun_	Make a script in /etc/rc2.d/ named something like S99eth0
2006-01-08T10:09:00.000Z	chun_	SEJeff	ok, let me take a look, thx
2006-01-08T10:11:00.000Z	chun_	SEJeff	erm, i am not very good writing scripts....
2006-01-08T10:11:00.000Z	chun_	SEJeff	or i can just stick ifup eth0 as the script?
2006-01-08T10:11:00.000Z	SEJeff	chun_	Make the first line #!/bin/bash, that is the command interpreter. Make the second line ifup eth0 (or eth1 or whatever). Then run chmod +x S99eth0
2006-01-08T10:12:00.000Z	chun_	SEJeff	ok kewl, thx again
