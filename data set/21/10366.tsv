2005-03-23T09:39:00.000Z	Absenth		Good Morning.
2005-03-23T09:39:00.000Z	ompaul	Absenth	good morning to you too
2005-09-28T14:23:00.000Z	Absenth	ompaul	do I have to add any repos to APT to install skype?
2005-09-28T14:24:00.000Z	ompaul	Absenth	you can do and I suggest you do - and don't say that it a debian repo it is not it is a skype repo ... >> deb http://download.skype.com/linux/repos/debian/ stable non-free
2005-09-28T14:25:00.000Z	ompaul	Absenth	that comment was for others who jump in and call it a deb repo which it ain't :)
2005-09-28T14:25:00.000Z	Absenth	ompaul	Belutz danke.
2005-09-28T14:26:00.000Z	ompaul	Absenth	np
2005-09-28T14:27:00.000Z	Absenth	ompaul	Belutz, I get an error saying libqu3c102-mt must be >= 3:3.3.3.2  and the one I have is 3:3.3.3-yUbuntu3
2005-09-28T14:27:00.000Z	Absenth	ompaul	Belutz, any suggestions?
2005-09-28T14:27:00.000Z	ompaul	Absenth	, now try >>sudo apt-get install libqt3-mt<<
2005-09-28T14:29:00.000Z	Absenth	ompaul	package libqt3-mt is not avalible, but is referred to by another package...  However the following packages replace it: libqt3c102-mt libqt3c102
2005-09-28T14:29:00.000Z	ompaul	Absenth	feckers in skype upgraded and demand a new file we don't have
2005-09-28T14:29:00.000Z	ompaul	Absenth	apt-cache search  libqt3-mt gave you that correct?
2005-09-28T14:30:00.000Z	Absenth	ompaul	sudo apt-get install libqt3-mt
2005-09-28T14:30:00.000Z	Absenth	ompaul	gave me that.
2005-09-28T14:31:00.000Z	ompaul	Absenth	this is down to skype not building a real .deb in the first place
2005-09-28T14:33:00.000Z	ompaul	Absenth	na I will report the problem to skype - as I need it for some luser calls
2005-09-28T14:37:00.000Z	ompaul	Absenth	can I message you?
2005-09-28T14:37:00.000Z	Absenth	ompaul	sure.
