2006-05-25T15:43:00.000Z	tony_		hi im getting this error when trying to open 'System-->Add application'
2006-05-25T15:44:00.000Z	tony_		Unable to copy the user's Xauthorization file.
2006-05-25T15:44:00.000Z	tony_		does anyone knows how to fix this?
2006-05-25T15:44:00.000Z	tony_		thanks in advance.
2006-05-25T15:45:00.000Z	Madpilot	tony_	do any of the admin tools work for you?
2006-05-25T15:45:00.000Z	tony_	Madpilot	no, all gives me the same error.
2006-05-25T15:48:00.000Z	tony_	Madpilot	when googled i read that i need to change ownership of .Xauthority file, but there is one file per user. so where should i change? the file for root, or file for the current user?
2006-05-25T15:48:00.000Z	Madpilot	tony_	file for current user, I think
2006-05-25T15:49:00.000Z	tony_	Madpilot	ok. then there is another problem, how to specify the owner of file as 'Anybody'. This is what a solution page told me to do. But chown says 'Anybody' is invalid user.
2006-05-25T15:50:00.000Z	Madpilot	tony_	what page are you reading?
2006-05-25T15:50:00.000Z	tony_	Madpilot	this is the page  http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=781066&postcount=13
2006-05-25T15:51:00.000Z	tony_	Madpilot	sorry this is the correct page : https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-users/2005-June/039871.html
2006-05-25T15:52:00.000Z	Madpilot	tony_	"sudo rm ~/.Xauthority" - and read the next two or three lines below that phrase in the URL you just gave
2006-05-25T15:52:00.000Z	tony_	Madpilot	ok thank you. i will try that then.
2006-05-25T15:53:00.000Z	Madpilot	tony_	it's OK to remove (rm) .Xauthority because it gets re-created on every new login
2006-05-25T15:53:00.000Z	tony_	Madpilot	ok. thanks for that information. i was afraid to do so :-)
2006-05-25T15:54:00.000Z	tony_	Madpilot	one more doubt, do i need to restart X to see effect of changing ownership of the .Xauthority?
2006-05-25T15:54:00.000Z	Madpilot	tony_	yes - do the rm command in terminal, then hit Ctrl+Alt+Backspace to kill & restart X
2006-05-25T15:54:00.000Z	tony_	Madpilot	ok thank you.
