2010-09-05T23:09:00.000Z	jcdutton	gryllida	apt-get install aptitude
2010-09-05T23:11:00.000Z	jcdutton	gryllida	I do not think teamviewer will help you
2010-09-05T22:57:00.000Z	jcdutton	gryllida	what do you need wine for ?
2010-09-05T23:03:00.000Z	gryllida	jcdutton	ServerTech said I need it for teamviewer.
2010-09-05T23:05:00.000Z	jcdutton	gryllida	 If teamviewer is a windows program, they ServerTech was right
2010-09-05T23:07:00.000Z	jcdutton	gryllida	do you have synaptic package manager?
2010-09-05T23:08:00.000Z	gryllida	jcdutton	how do I know?
2010-09-05T23:08:00.000Z	jcdutton	gryllida	via menus.   System->Administrator->Synaptic
2010-09-05T23:08:00.000Z	gryllida	jcdutton	it's .. a server. I only have cli access.
2010-09-05T23:09:00.000Z	gryllida	jcdutton	hence why I want the teamviewer
2010-09-05T23:09:00.000Z	jcdutton	gryllida	Ok. do you have aptitude installed ?
2010-09-05T23:09:00.000Z	gryllida	jcdutton	"apt-get" works, so maybe yes
2010-09-05T23:12:00.000Z	gryllida	jcdutton	help with?
2010-09-05T23:13:00.000Z	jcdutton	gryllida	what do you want teamviewer for? The teamviewer web site says it is a remote access tool
2010-09-05T23:14:00.000Z	jcdutton	gryllida	Do you have ssh access to the server ?
2010-09-05T23:14:00.000Z	jcdutton	gryllida	just connect to it with "ssh -Y username@hostname"
2010-09-05T23:15:00.000Z	jcdutton	gryllida	then run "xterm" and you have your remote gui working for the server.
2010-09-05T23:19:00.000Z	gryllida	jcdutton	ok. but when I add -Y option to ssh command, it says 'connection timed out', though it does succeed in the usual way.
2010-09-05T23:23:00.000Z	gryllida	jcdutton	hello there. I tried to add -Y option to ssh command, it says 'connection timed out', though it does succeed in the usual way.
2010-09-05T23:24:00.000Z	jcdutton	gryllida	It should not time out. What is the "usual way" ?
