2007-10-31T21:05:00.000Z	E_mE		im trying to install xserver-xgl into my kubuntu gutsy ... but when i write startx
2007-10-31T21:06:00.000Z	E_mE		it just goes to the X screen, and  doesn't load up KDE
2007-10-31T21:06:00.000Z	ikonia	E_mE	startx uses .xinitd to tell it what to launch
2007-10-31T21:06:00.000Z	E_mE	ikonia	where is .xinitd?
2007-10-31T21:07:00.000Z	ikonia	E_mE	.xinitrd in your home dir
2007-10-31T21:07:00.000Z	E_mE	ikonia	i haven't got it... im in kubuntu
2007-10-31T21:08:00.000Z	ikonia	E_mE	why are you using startx - you don't have a .xinitrd because you don't need one, you only need one if your using startx
2007-10-31T21:08:00.000Z	E_mE	ikonia	i do use startx
2007-10-31T21:08:00.000Z	E_mE	ikonia	i dont use KDM
2007-10-31T21:08:00.000Z	ikonia	E_mE	WHY do you use startx
2007-10-31T21:09:00.000Z	E_mE	ikonia	because i boot streight into console... not KDM
2007-10-31T21:09:00.000Z	ikonia	E_mE	then you need to create and populate a .xinitrd
2007-10-31T21:10:00.000Z	E_mE	ikonia	but if im not using xserver-xgl, it boots into KDE with no problems... only when i install the xgl
2007-10-31T21:10:00.000Z	ikonia	E_mE	maybe thats using the default
2007-10-31T21:11:00.000Z	E_mE	ikonia	what do i need to put in my .xinitrd?
2007-10-31T21:11:00.000Z	ikonia	E_mE	something like /usr/bin/startkde
2007-10-31T21:12:00.000Z	E_mE	ikonia	its calling Xsession
2007-10-31T21:12:00.000Z	ikonia	E_mE	ahhhh ok that explains why it worked before
2007-10-31T21:13:00.000Z	E_mE	ikonia	so i create my .xinitrc in my /home/area with /usr/bin/startkde
2007-10-31T21:13:00.000Z	ikonia	E_mE	sounds worth a try
2007-10-31T21:13:00.000Z	E_mE	ikonia	ill try it
