2009-09-19T21:19:00.000Z	shane2peru	Wizards	is awn the same as avant?
2009-09-19T21:19:00.000Z	Wizards	shane2peru	don't listen to them they think they are too good of computer pros to have a dock
2009-09-19T21:19:00.000Z	Wizards	shane2peru	yeah
2009-09-19T21:20:00.000Z	shane2peru	Wizards	I'm confident enough in my computer usage to not pay any attention to them
2009-09-19T21:20:00.000Z	shane2peru	Wizards	they look neat
2009-09-19T21:21:00.000Z	shane2peru	Wizards	I think there was a bug I saw somewhere that alsa crashed with some cards
2009-09-19T21:44:00.000Z	shane2peru	Wizards	you can restart your sound with this:  sudo /etc/init.d/alsa-utils restart
2009-09-19T21:45:00.000Z	shane2peru	Wizards	perhaps it will give you an error that you can start troubleshooting with
2009-09-19T21:45:00.000Z	shane2peru	Wizards	do you know what your sound card is?
2009-09-19T21:48:00.000Z	Wizards	shane2peru	i did the command and i got shutting down ALSA then starting up alsa
