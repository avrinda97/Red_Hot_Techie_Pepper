2010-07-12T19:13:00.000Z	ikonia	askhader	what's up ?
2010-07-12T19:13:00.000Z	askhader	ikonia	Not much, yourself?
2010-07-12T19:14:00.000Z	ikonia	askhader	sorry, I thought you where asking a question
2010-07-12T19:14:00.000Z	askhader	ikonia	quite alright?
2011-07-09T21:51:00.000Z	ikonia	askhader	poor support ?
2011-07-09T21:51:00.000Z	askhader	ikonia	What's that supposed to mean?
2011-07-09T21:51:00.000Z	ikonia	askhader	exactly what it sounds like "why is it doing it" - poor support from the graphics driver
2011-07-09T21:51:00.000Z	askhader	ikonia	That's a silly excuse.
2011-07-09T21:51:00.000Z	ikonia	askhader	it's nothing to do with ubuntu
2011-07-09T21:52:00.000Z	ikonia	askhader	no, it'a realistick answer
2011-07-09T21:52:00.000Z	ikonia	askhader	clearly not, as your complaining it's not working
2011-07-09T21:52:00.000Z	ikonia	askhader	nvidia is a closed source driver made by nvidia, it's results on Linux vary depending on a lot of things
2011-07-09T21:53:00.000Z	ikonia	askhader	its capability and stabilty are nothing to do with Ubuntu, or Linux in general but the way the driver is written by nvidia
2011-07-09T21:53:00.000Z	askhader	ikonia	Good, that's not what I was talking about.
2011-07-09T21:53:00.000Z	ikonia	askhader	and it has done here
2011-07-09T21:53:00.000Z	ikonia	askhader	you're not listing, the driver for nvidia is not provided by ubuntu
2011-07-09T21:54:00.000Z	ikonia	askhader	you can't tweak it, - it's a closed source driver
2011-07-09T21:54:00.000Z	ikonia	askhader	then I suggest you ask for support elsewhere, try #nvidia or the nvidia forum
2011-07-09T21:54:00.000Z	askhader	ikonia	You have fun trying to tweak nvidia.
2011-07-09T21:54:00.000Z	ikonia	askhader	I'm not trying to tweak it
