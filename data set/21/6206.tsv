2007-09-05T10:02:00.000Z	sipior	sunnypies	is sshd running on the target box?
2007-09-05T10:02:00.000Z	sunnypies	sipior	whats the command to check that?
2007-09-05T10:02:00.000Z	sipior	sunnypies	on the target machine, try "netstat -antu | grep 22"
2007-09-05T10:03:00.000Z	sunnypies	sipior	ok one minute
2007-09-05T10:06:00.000Z	sunnypies	sipior	when we tried to start sshd it returned "failed"
2007-09-05T10:06:00.000Z	sipior	sunnypies	and if you try starting the daemon manually? /usr/bin/sshd or whatever
2007-09-05T10:07:00.000Z	sipior	sunnypies	/usr/sbin/sshd
2007-09-05T10:07:00.000Z	sunnypies	sipior	would i type "/usr/sbin/sshd start"?
2007-09-05T10:07:00.000Z	sipior	sunnypies	no, just /usr/sbin/sshd
2007-09-05T10:08:00.000Z	sipior	sunnypies	sudo /usr/sbin/sshd, actually
2007-09-05T10:08:00.000Z	sunnypies	sipior	the computer is in different room, i will try that
2007-09-05T10:12:00.000Z	sunnypies	sipior	when we did /usr/sbin/sshd it said "execution requires an absolute path"
2007-09-05T10:13:00.000Z	sipior	sunnypies	yuo could type the exact command line you used?
2007-09-05T10:13:00.000Z	sipior	sunnypies	could you, rather
2007-09-05T10:13:00.000Z	sunnypies	sipior	type what?

2007-09-05T10:17:00.000Z	sipior	sunnypies	the exact command you used to start the ssh daemon
2007-09-05T10:34:00.000Z	sunnypies	sipior	we figured it out,  a bunch of permissions were changed but thanks for the help
