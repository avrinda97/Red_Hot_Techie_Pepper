2012-07-23T12:37:00.000Z	HungryMan		So how would I go about having my /init/x.conf use one of those others? Sorry, I had to restart
2012-07-23T12:38:00.000Z	HungryMan		I created a script in /init/ that's starting up before apparmor so it's starting unconfined
2012-07-23T12:38:00.000Z	HungryMan		restarting isn't really an option as it breaks the process
2012-07-23T12:40:00.000Z	usr13_	HungryMan	Did you put a symlink somewhere else?
2012-07-23T12:40:00.000Z	usr13_	HungryMan	Wait,.... if you put the script in /etc/init/  that's the wrong place, isnt' it?
2012-07-23T12:41:00.000Z	usr13_	HungryMan	Ok
2012-07-23T12:47:00.000Z	usr13_	HungryMan	update-rc.d
2012-07-23T12:48:00.000Z	usr13_	HungryMan	It breaks what?
2012-07-23T12:54:00.000Z	usr13_	HungryMan	Why can't you start it in rc.local?
2012-07-23T13:00:00.000Z	usr13_	HungryMan	Well, it just says:  "add this line to your /etc/rc.local file: /usr/sbin/dnscrypt-proxy --daemonize"
2012-07-23T13:00:00.000Z	usr13_	HungryMan	So starting it last is what you want.
2012-07-23T13:12:00.000Z	usr13_	HungryMan	What does /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf look like?
2012-07-23T13:13:00.000Z	usr13_	HungryMan	What broke?
2012-07-23T13:16:00.000Z	usr13_	HungryMan	I do not understand the step to "disable the local resolver"
2012-07-23T13:20:00.000Z	usr13_	HungryMan	I do not understand the step to "disable the local resolver" Because you never had dns=dnsmasq in NetworkManager.conf in the first place.
2012-07-23T13:22:00.000Z	usr13_	HungryMan	What did you have in there to start with?  (in rc.local)
2012-07-23T13:24:00.000Z	usr13_	HungryMan	No, I mean the line to start dnsscrypt
2012-07-23T13:24:00.000Z	usr13_	HungryMan	I thought you tried it?
2012-07-23T13:25:00.000Z	usr13_	HungryMan	Just use  /usr/sbin/dnscrypt-proxy --daemonize
2012-07-23T13:27:00.000Z	usr13_	HungryMan	pastebinit /usr/sbin/dynscrypt-proxy
2012-07-23T13:34:00.000Z	usr13_	HungryMan	I would just start over.  Follow the instructions just ast they are and see where it went wrong.
