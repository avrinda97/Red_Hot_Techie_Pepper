2007-02-02T17:38:00.000Z	aidan		should i update to edgy though? or better to update to dapper
2007-02-02T17:40:00.000Z	tom_	aidan	dapper is more stable than edgy, it has about 4 1/2 years of support left. Edgy has less support and is using newer, more experimental packages. If stability is more important to you than cutting edge features, stick with Dapper.
2007-02-02T17:43:00.000Z	tom_	aidan	it updates the software only, it won't touch your personal files.
2007-02-02T17:44:00.000Z	tom_	aidan	well upgrading from breezy to dapper, you will need to install some newer gstreamer packages after.
2007-02-02T17:52:00.000Z	tom_	aidan	follow the directions here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DapperUpgrades#head-792e320b3976df97f0d8b47047e1bcc955fd2569
2007-02-02T06:02:00.000Z	aidan	tom_	nered help
2007-02-02T06:03:00.000Z	aidan	tom_	need help stuck
2007-02-02T06:03:00.000Z	tom_	aidan	what's up?
2007-02-02T06:05:00.000Z	tom_	aidan	you enabled the "Breezy-Updates" repository as the guide suggested?
2007-02-02T06:06:00.000Z	tom_	aidan	if so, you should see a little tab at the top that says "new distribution available, dapper 6.06" something along those lines. you'll want to click upgrade.
2007-02-02T06:08:00.000Z	tom_	aidan	i'm not sure it matters, but if it isn't working, don't change the sources.list file back to breezy, it can only mess things up more. you can't go backwards.
2007-02-02T06:08:00.000Z	tom_	aidan	i'm going to eat dinner right now, if you have any more problems, there's lots of people in here who have upgraded, and would be willing to help.
