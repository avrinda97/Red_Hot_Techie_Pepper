2007-02-10T11:58:00.000Z	cables		I know that the Ubuntu video drivers break suspend and hibernate, but does that happen to everybody? Is there anyone here who has the Nvidia driver AND can suspend/hibernate their computer?
2007-02-10T11:59:00.000Z	mneptok	cables	never send a GUI to do a CLI job ;)
2007-02-10T12:00:00.000Z	cables	mneptok	is he already in the CLI?
2007-03-14T10:59:00.000Z	mneptok	cables	any such corruption could be fixed with fsck_ext2
2007-03-14T11:00:00.000Z	cables	mneptok	that's not the problem
2007-03-14T11:02:00.000Z	mneptok	cables	corruption can happen with journalling, it's just less likely. but if the corrupted bits are the journal bits, journalling ain't gonna save your bacon. :)
2007-03-14T11:02:00.000Z	cables	mneptok	yes, but it makes it less likely, in the event of a hard shutdown.
2007-03-14T11:23:00.000Z	cables	mneptok	it will, but it's dangerous
2007-03-14T11:25:00.000Z	cables	mneptok	the reason visudo is good is because it prevents you from creating an unparseable sudoers. Unparseable sudoers = big problems
2007-03-14T12:50:00.000Z	cables	mneptok	what's with the banning/d-lining-ness?
2007-03-14T12:53:00.000Z	cables	mneptok	I'm just curious :)
2007-04-09T11:31:00.000Z	mneptok	cables	not if he installed off a server CD ;)
2007-04-09T11:31:00.000Z	cables	mneptok	how'd you guess?
2007-05-31T06:39:00.000Z	cables	mneptok	not true, the algorithm it uses is fine, it was simply implemented in a very breakable way.
2007-05-31T06:42:00.000Z	cables	mneptok	he may be, but that doesn't make you any less wrong... it's not a bad encryption algorithm, it's just a really insecure implementation that exposes the weaknesses in the encryption algorithm they did use
2007-06-02T09:37:00.000Z	mneptok	cables	do you think major torrent releases run on top of uTorrent? i assure you Ubuntu doesn't. ;)
2007-06-02T09:37:00.000Z	cables	mneptok	I mean as a client, not a server...
2007-06-02T09:38:00.000Z	mneptok	cables	clients are servers with torrents
2007-06-02T09:38:00.000Z	cables	mneptok	good point :)
2007-06-02T09:38:00.000Z	mneptok	cables	the tracker is a wholly separate thing
2007-06-02T09:38:00.000Z	cables	mneptok	I'm just saying that right now, one of the best GUI clients is uTorrent, and it runs nicely in Wine.
