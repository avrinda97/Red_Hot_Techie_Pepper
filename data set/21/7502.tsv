2008-11-24T23:20:00.000Z	b^j	blackpearl	i don't see /mnt/shared in there, is it mounted currently?
2008-11-24T23:21:00.000Z	blackpearl	b^j	: that is what i am asking how to mount my /mnt/shared folder Or how to make it writable
2008-11-24T23:23:00.000Z	b^j	blackpearl	ok, i thought it was already mounted for some reason, i wanted to make sure it wasn't something silly like the fs was mounted read only
2008-11-24T23:24:00.000Z	blackpearl	b^j	: so can i have the solution to mount /mnt/shared folder ???
2008-11-24T23:25:00.000Z	b^j	blackpearl	what does ls -l /mnt give you
2008-11-24T23:27:00.000Z	blackpearl	b^j	: please see this ..for ls -l /mnt output
2008-11-24T23:28:00.000Z	b^j	blackpearl	i think you forgot the link
2008-11-24T23:29:00.000Z	blackpearl	b^j	: please see this http://paste.ubuntu.com/76505/ ..for ls -l /mnt output
2008-11-24T23:30:00.000Z	b^j	blackpearl	you could try "sudo chown -R <your username> /mnt/shared
2008-11-24T23:30:00.000Z	b^j	blackpearl	as long as this is only for storing files that are yours that shouldn't mess anything up
2008-11-24T23:44:00.000Z	blackpearl	b^j	: can you tell me the command again i got disconnect from net and my computer booted.
2008-11-24T23:45:00.000Z	b^j	blackpearl	sudo chown -R <your user name> /mnt/shared
2008-11-24T23:48:00.000Z	blackpearl	b^j	: what took you so long to understand to tell me this command sudo chown -R <your username> /mnt/shared...VOILA it worked :)..thanx
