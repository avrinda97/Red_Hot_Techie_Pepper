2008-07-08T03:25:00.000Z	Kovert	Storrgie	how do you kniow it isnt the drive?
2008-07-08T03:25:00.000Z	Storrgie	Kovert	when i leave the machine alone for a little bit, it seems to want to go into a sleeping mode
2008-07-08T03:25:00.000Z	Kovert	Storrgie	so set the power management
2008-07-08T03:26:00.000Z	Storrgie	Kovert	i dont know what to set in power managerment
2008-07-08T03:26:00.000Z	Storrgie	Kovert	its not like the screen is dimming or something, its that the machine seems to want to scale down its processing
2008-07-08T03:26:00.000Z	Kovert	Storrgie	you need to set the standby settings
2008-07-08T03:26:00.000Z	Storrgie	Kovert	where would that be?
2008-07-08T03:27:00.000Z	Kovert	Storrgie	in the system setting but to be more specific I dotn knopw
2008-07-08T03:28:00.000Z	Storrgie	Kovert	i dont know if thats my issue, i dunno if i have ever set anything like that
2008-07-08T03:29:00.000Z	Kovert	Storrgie	no time to learn but the present
2008-07-08T03:29:00.000Z	Storrgie	Kovert	dont think thats the issue though, any other suggestions?
2008-07-08T03:29:00.000Z	Kovert	Storrgie	well it coudl be a time base issue
2008-07-08T03:29:00.000Z	Storrgie	Kovert	please explain
2008-07-08T03:30:00.000Z	Kovert	Storrgie	have a friend cut a cd with a pure sine wave on it see if the freq changes
2008-07-08T03:30:00.000Z	Storrgie	Kovert	i could do that, but it sounds ridiculous
2008-07-08T03:30:00.000Z	Storrgie		haha
2008-07-08T03:32:00.000Z	Storrgie	Kovert	lets say that the frequency does change, what would be the next step?
2008-07-08T03:37:00.000Z	Kovert	Storrgie	then it woudl usually be a bad drive
