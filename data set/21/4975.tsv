2010-09-11T09:44:00.000Z	gorgonzola		hello! anyone knows how to restore a usb disk drive firmware?
2010-09-11T09:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gorgonzola	i'd ask in #hardware
2010-09-11T09:45:00.000Z	gorgonzola	ActionParsnip	my thougts precisely, but apparently it is invitation only :S
2010-09-11T09:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gorgonzola	really?
2010-09-11T09:46:00.000Z	gorgonzola	ActionParsnip	that's what freenode said when i tried to join...
2010-09-11T09:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gorgonzola	you just need to be registered
2012-04-12T04:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gorgonzola	ask in #ubuntu+1 for Precise support please
2012-04-12T04:45:00.000Z	gorgonzola	ActionParsnip	i'm already there. but my question is more general, ie, is there any way to save the kernel buffer if the kernel is locking up before initializing anything?
2012-04-12T04:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gorgonzola	your quesion is regarding Precise which isn't supported here until release day
2012-04-12T04:46:00.000Z	gorgonzola	ActionParsnip	or more simply, how do i report bugs in the kernel boot process?
2012-04-12T04:47:00.000Z	gorgonzola	ActionParsnip	... a simple "i have no idea" would have been helpful. i know how to file bugs, i need to know how to o something needed for the bug report.
2012-04-12T04:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gorgonzola	the bot told you
2012-04-12T04:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gorgonzola	or ask in #ubuntu+1
2012-04-12T04:48:00.000Z	gorgonzola	ActionParsnip	dude. you are not reading my question. this is not a question about ubuntu+1. this is a uestion about filing bugs, but not a general type of question. the question is: how do i produce error reports to include in the bug that i alredy know how to fill that occurs in the kernel boot process
2012-04-12T04:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gorgonzola	ubuntu-bug linux     should kick off the process
2012-04-12T04:49:00.000Z	gorgonzola	ActionParsnip	in other words, does anyone here know how to save kernel boot messages? bootlogd is not working either, as the error occurs before it gets started.
2012-04-12T04:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gorgonzola	/var/log/dmesg*  maybe, one may be the last boot, the guys managing the bugs can advise how to get what they need
2012-04-12T04:50:00.000Z	gorgonzola	ActionParsnip	yeah, i guess i'll file it as is, and then see how to produce errors. i just thougth that  was a rather common thing.
2012-04-12T04:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gorgonzola	that's what I was getting at :). Remember Ubuntu's target audience :D
2012-04-12T05:35:00.000Z	gorgonzola	ActionParsnip	FYI, if any other peep comes along with a similar question, it seems we have pretty thorough how-tos on reporting esoteric kernel bugs: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingKernelBoot
2012-04-12T05:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gorgonzola	nice :)
