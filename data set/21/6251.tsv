2007-05-02T06:28:00.000Z	UltimoHedgehog		Anyone - I'm looking for someone good with Ndiswrapper.
2007-05-02T06:29:00.000Z	phixnay	UltimoHedgehog	what do you need to do, I've set it up before
2007-05-02T06:29:00.000Z	UltimoHedgehog	phixnay	- Mind if I direct you to a topic that explains it?
2007-05-02T06:30:00.000Z	phixnay	UltimoHedgehog	ok, but sounds serious. I am merely a user but I'll help as much as I can
2007-05-02T06:30:00.000Z	UltimoHedgehog	phixnay	- http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=414023&highlight=WPN111 I'm about as new as you can get to this.
2007-05-02T06:32:00.000Z	UltimoHedgehog	phixnay	- Anywhoo, I've got Ndiswrapper installed, but step 4 doesn't work for me and a multitude of others.
2007-05-02T06:34:00.000Z	phixnay	UltimoHedgehog	ok, this is different than how I installed, but try changing directories to where the file is might be your problem
2007-05-02T06:35:00.000Z	UltimoHedgehog	phixnay	- Did that, it gives me the same effect as just running ndiswrapper from the console, the options for running it.
2007-05-02T06:35:00.000Z	phixnay	UltimoHedgehog	do ndiswrapper -l
2007-05-02T06:36:00.000Z	UltimoHedgehog	phixnay	- Roger, I'll get back to you in a sec.
2007-05-02T06:37:00.000Z	UltimoHedgehog	phixnay	- It says driver installed, device (1358:5f01) present.
2007-05-02T06:37:00.000Z	phixnay	UltimoHedgehog	ok, that's good. What happens when you try step 4 then?
2007-05-02T06:38:00.000Z	UltimoHedgehog	phixnay	- However, there's no indication from the USB adapter that it's alive. As for trying step four, it's the same effect as just typing ndiswrapper in the console.
2007-05-02T06:39:00.000Z	phixnay	UltimoHedgehog	ok, this may take some time to try and understand what step 4 is trying to do. I'm going to read the ndiswrapper wiki to see if I get any answers
2007-05-02T06:40:00.000Z	phixnay	UltimoHedgehog	meanwhile, what happens if you skip step 4 and keep going?
2007-05-02T06:41:00.000Z	UltimoHedgehog	phixnay	- In short, it gives me the usage options, same as running Ndiswrapper in the console.
2007-05-02T06:41:00.000Z	phixnay	UltimoHedgehog	even for step 5?
2007-05-02T06:42:00.000Z	UltimoHedgehog	phixnay	- I haven't tried that yet, I want to make sure step four works.
2007-05-02T06:44:00.000Z	phixnay	UltimoHedgehog	according to the ndiswrapper wiki, if it says the driver installed hardware present thing, it's ready for step 5
2007-05-02T06:44:00.000Z	UltimoHedgehog	phixnay	- Oh? Well, maybe I'll go on ahead then.
2007-05-02T06:45:00.000Z	phixnay	UltimoHedgehog	the guide does things slightly differently than usual. Normally you cd to the directory with the driver files and do ndiswrapper -i driverfile.inf and it automatically adds the .bins or whatever else is there.
