2008-08-06T19:58:00.000Z	eloquence		how can i find what ports are currently open?
2008-08-06T19:58:00.000Z	eloquence		i am running sopcast and it broadcasts on a port which i have to open with vlc media player
2008-08-06T20:00:00.000Z	Beefeater	eloquence	are you using the gui or the command line?
2008-08-06T20:00:00.000Z	eloquence		well i tried both and with both i am lost
2008-08-06T20:00:00.000Z	eloquence		i tried with the gui and it opened the channel for a few seconds with mplayer
2008-08-06T20:00:00.000Z	eloquence		then it disappeared
2008-08-06T20:00:00.000Z	eloquence		and i essentially want it to play with vlc player
2008-08-06T20:01:00.000Z	eloquence		so i changed mplayer to vlc in the "config" tab
2008-08-06T20:01:00.000Z	eloquence		but i have been unabe to play it again
2008-08-06T20:01:00.000Z	Beefeater		I'm not using the gui. But I start it like this ./sp-sc-auth sop://broker.sopcast.com:3912/6001 3908 8908 > /dev/null &
2008-08-06T20:02:00.000Z	eloquence		i changed it back to mplayer and it's working fine
2008-08-06T20:02:00.000Z	Beefeater		and then open it with vlc, http://localhost:8908/tv.asf
2008-08-06T20:02:00.000Z	eloquence		k
2008-08-06T20:02:00.000Z	Beefeater		Alright. Good then :-)
2008-08-06T20:02:00.000Z	eloquence		i prefer vlc
2008-08-06T20:02:00.000Z	eloquence		vlc > *
2008-08-06T20:02:00.000Z	eloquence		thanks though
2008-08-06T20:02:00.000Z	Beefeater		Np.
2008-08-06T20:04:00.000Z	eloquence		well it seams the US is beating Russia by 10 points (1st Quarter/Basketball)
2008-08-06T20:05:00.000Z	eloquence	Beefeater	it seems it must be broadcasting on another port than 8908 cuz vlc cant find it
2008-08-06T20:06:00.000Z	Beefeater	eloquence	check with lsof -i -nP
