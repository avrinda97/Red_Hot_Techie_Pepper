2008-06-16T00:37:00.000Z	erUSUL	DeFirence	edit /etc/hosts and make sure two first lines are like this 1. 127.0.0.1       localhost <hostname> 2. 127.0.1.1       <hostname>
2008-06-16T00:38:00.000Z	DeFirence	erUSUL	cant sudo edit /etc/hosts cause sudo cant resolve host name
2008-06-16T00:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	DeFirence	log into recovery mode
2008-06-16T00:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	DeFirence	on grub menu there is an entry to boot the machine (ubuntu) in recovery mode
2008-06-16T00:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	DeFirence	you will en on a terminal envoirment use "nano /etc/hosts" to edit the file
2008-06-16T00:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	DeFirence	<hostname> is your actual hostname
2008-06-16T00:43:00.000Z	DeFirence	erUSUL	the first 2 lines are: 127.0.0.1 localhost -and- 127.0.1.1 ubuntu.mydomain.co.za
2008-06-16T00:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	DeFirence	add ubuntu.mydomain.co.za to the end of the first line sepparating it from localhost by a tab
2008-06-16T00:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	DeFirence	i hope so
2008-06-16T00:47:00.000Z	DeFirence	erUSUL	same problem :<
2008-06-16T00:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	DeFirence	:|
