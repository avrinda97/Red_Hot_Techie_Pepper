2005-06-09T16:20:00.000Z	jaysunn		can anyone help with this
2005-06-09T16:20:00.000Z	jaysunn		E: The package openofficeorg-core04 needs to be reinstalled, but I can't find an archive for it.
2005-06-09T16:21:00.000Z	jaysunn		whats base-config do?
2005-06-09T16:22:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jaysunn	it's the base configuration that the installer uses to ask you questions about ... erm, the base system
2005-06-09T16:33:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jaysunn	go to for example, pastebin.com and paste there
2005-06-09T16:33:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jaysunn	then report the URL for your paste to the channel
2005-06-09T16:36:00.000Z	jaysunn	thoreauputic	now what?
2005-06-09T16:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jaysunn	wait for someone to look :)
2005-06-09T16:39:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jaysunn	as far as I can see , the package doesn't exist - so the error is odd to say the least
2005-06-09T16:39:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jaysunn	are you using hoary?
2005-06-09T16:41:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jaysunn	it's a good idea to address the nick you are trying to talk to: the channel is busy and it's easy to miss a message
2005-06-09T16:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jaysunn	are you using the standard open office or the newer one?
2005-06-09T16:43:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jaysunn	the package name in your error message doesn't appear in any repository - so it's very strange that your command produced such an error
2005-06-09T16:44:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jaysunn	have you changed your /etc/apt/sources.list file?
2005-06-09T16:44:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jaysunn	ah
2005-06-09T16:44:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jaysunn	don't
2005-06-09T16:44:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jaysunn	you've confused the package manager something terrible ;)
2005-06-09T16:45:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jaysunn	uninstall it if you can, and stick to the synaptic / apt sources
2005-06-09T16:46:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jaysunn	when you install 3rd party apps , this can happen
2005-06-09T16:46:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jaysunn	almost everything is avilable in the repositories
2005-06-09T16:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jaysunn	umm - if it's the binary you use the installer to uninstall it I think ( but I haven't used it in a *long* time, because apt is so relianle and easy
