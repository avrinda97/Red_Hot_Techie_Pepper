2005-11-03T08:24:00.000Z	Xeromem		Ok guys: i've got a problem here
2005-11-03T08:24:00.000Z	Xeromem		what i have: 2 PC's
2005-11-03T08:24:00.000Z	Xeromem		1 PC with 2 eth-cards (ubuntu)
2005-11-03T08:25:00.000Z	Xeromem		and 1 PC with 1 eth-card (winxp)
2005-11-03T08:25:00.000Z	Xeromem		internet comes directly to pc with linux on it
2005-11-03T08:25:00.000Z	Xeromem		pc1 and pc2 are directly connected
2005-11-03T08:25:00.000Z	Xeromem		problem is, pc2 can't acces internet
2005-11-03T08:26:00.000Z	Xeromem		yep
2005-11-03T08:26:00.000Z	mshade	Xeromem	with a crossover? or regular ethernet cable?
2005-11-03T08:27:00.000Z	mshade	Xeromem	what's the gateway and dns on windows set to
2005-11-03T08:28:00.000Z	mshade	Xeromem	192.168.0.1 should be the gateway on the XP machine
2005-11-03T08:28:00.000Z	mshade	Xeromem	and you'll also have to set the DNS servers manually.
2005-11-03T08:29:00.000Z	mshade	Xeromem	your dsn servers.
2005-11-03T08:29:00.000Z	mshade	Xeromem	check /etc/resolv.conf
2005-11-03T08:30:00.000Z	mshade	Xeromem	you want to put whatever is in /etc/resolv.conf as your DNS servers in winXP
2005-11-03T08:30:00.000Z	mshade	Xeromem	the IP addresses are all you need.  you don't need telenet.be
2005-11-03T08:33:00.000Z	mshade	Xeromem	kill the firewall first.
2005-11-03T08:33:00.000Z	mshade	Xeromem	eliminate the possibility.
2005-11-03T08:33:00.000Z	mshade	Xeromem	once the connection is working, you can enable the firewall and troubleshoot it.  but you want as simple a setup as possible to start with.
