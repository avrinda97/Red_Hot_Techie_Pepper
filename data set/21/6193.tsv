2007-05-17T14:53:00.000Z	Zigosity		Hello. I'm (still) trying to share a FAT32 partition on Ubuntu with a windows machine. I can't seem to set permissions on the drive so I can share it, and people have told me that you just can't. I still think sharing it is possible though, anyone know how?
2007-05-17T14:54:00.000Z	jrib	Zigosity	umask=0000 option
2007-05-17T14:54:00.000Z	Zigosity	jrib	What does that do?
2007-05-17T14:55:00.000Z	jrib	Zigosity	gives all files 777 permissions
2007-05-17T14:55:00.000Z	Zigosity	jrib	I'm assuming there's a difference between 000 and 0000? I had it on 000 before.
2007-05-17T14:55:00.000Z	jrib	Zigosity	maybe I misunderstood... are you trying to do something other than writing to your fat32 on linux?
2007-05-17T14:56:00.000Z	Zigosity	jrib	Trying to share the thing with a windows PC
2007-05-17T14:56:00.000Z	Zigosity	jrib	I can write to it just fine
2007-05-17T14:56:00.000Z	jrib	Zigosity	oh, a different machine
2007-05-17T14:59:00.000Z	jrib	Zigosity	http://www.bsdforums.org/forums/archive/index.php/t-2841.html looks similar
2007-05-17T15:01:00.000Z	Zigosity	jrib	Okay, so, if I'm reading this properly... I need to make a new dir, change that dir's permissions, then mount the FAT32 drive in it?
2007-05-17T15:02:00.000Z	jrib	Zigosity	there was some mention of editing smb.conf .  I don't use sambda, so I don't know much about it
2007-05-17T15:02:00.000Z	Zigosity	jrib	I've been exploring samba to get this working for a few days, I understand that part =P
2007-05-17T15:14:00.000Z	Zigosity	jrib	Thank you SO MUCH. That page you linked me to had the solution! Hurrrah! You're my hero : D
2007-05-17T15:14:00.000Z	jrib	Zigosity	what did you have to do out of curiousity?
2007-05-17T15:14:00.000Z	Zigosity	jrib	I've been trying to get this working for FOUR DAYS STRAIGHT
2007-05-17T15:15:00.000Z	Zigosity	jrib	Just mount the partition to somewhere other than /media. Then I could change permissions easily.
2007-05-17T15:15:00.000Z	jrib	Zigosity	oh
2007-05-17T15:15:00.000Z	Zigosity	jrib	As with all computer problems, It made me feel really stupid. But I'm happy now.. Hehe
2007-05-17T15:16:00.000Z	jrib	Zigosity	well glad you got it to work
2007-05-17T15:16:00.000Z	Zigosity	jrib	So am I =D
