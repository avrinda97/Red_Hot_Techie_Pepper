2006-01-10T06:41:00.000Z	titanium_platypu		I'd rather just get xxms, have it be a much more compact player, and have it work right away
2006-01-10T06:42:00.000Z	titanium_platypu		hm....
2006-01-10T06:42:00.000Z	titanium_platypu		"command not found" or "no input files"?
2006-01-10T06:43:00.000Z	titanium_platypu		oh, okay....
2006-01-10T06:43:00.000Z	titanium_platypu		that's odd
2006-01-10T06:43:00.000Z	titanium_platypu		it should be finding it if you installed it;
2006-01-10T06:43:00.000Z	titanium_platypu		.*
2006-01-10T06:45:00.000Z	titanium_platypu		when I say "apt-get install kernel-source" it gives me three versions to pick from
2006-01-10T06:45:00.000Z	titanium_platypu		none of them are my kernel version
2006-01-10T06:45:00.000Z	titanium_platypu		what do I do?
2006-01-10T06:47:00.000Z	gratuit	titanium_platypu	do you need the source or the headers?
2006-01-10T06:47:00.000Z	titanium_platypu		the source
2006-01-10T06:47:00.000Z	titanium_platypu		so I can install Nvidia drivers
2006-01-10T06:47:00.000Z	gratuit	titanium_platypu	you only need the headers
2006-01-10T06:47:00.000Z	titanium_platypu		the headers are already on there....
2006-01-10T06:48:00.000Z	titanium_platypu		and the driver installation complains that it can't find kernel source.
2006-01-10T06:48:00.000Z	gratuit	titanium_platypu	do you have a sym link at /usr/src/linux -> /usr/src/<header dir>?
2006-01-10T06:49:00.000Z	gratuit	titanium_platypu	and you don know that the nvidia modules are in the linux-restricted-modules package right?
2006-01-10T06:50:00.000Z	gratuit	titanium_platypu	so there is little need to build them
2006-01-10T06:50:00.000Z	titanium_platypu	gratuit	the only thing in my /usr/src/ directory is an "rpm" directory.
2006-01-10T06:50:00.000Z	gratuit	titanium_platypu	then you don't have the headers installed
