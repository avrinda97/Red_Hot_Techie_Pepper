2007-03-22T16:41:00.000Z	octoberdan		I just finished compiling and installing kernel 2.6.20, but when I reboot my comp hangs at "Waiting for root file system." I googled around an discovered several threads started by people with the same problem. However, in their case they had SATA hard drives (hence the problem) I do not. I've followed the directions given by helpful people across the internet, but still can't reboot.
2007-03-22T16:41:00.000Z	octoberdan		I've run into this problem before, but have never solved it. Each time I try, I just end up running out of time and booting into my old kernel
2007-03-22T16:43:00.000Z	octoberdan		Anyone know what's going on with me? I'm desprate
2007-03-22T09:30:00.000Z	octoberdan		I'm having some strange problems when trying to install the package I created for my compiled kernel: http://paste.uni.cc/13837
2007-03-22T09:30:00.000Z	octoberdan		"Couldn't find package update-grub" ???
2007-03-22T09:30:00.000Z	disasm	octoberdan	update-grub is part of grub package
2007-03-22T09:31:00.000Z	octoberdan	disasm	But I have that installed... Why would it be bitching at me?
2007-03-22T09:31:00.000Z	octoberdan	disasm	And shouldn't it be grub-update?
2007-03-22T09:31:00.000Z	disasm	octoberdan	are you running update-grub?
2007-03-22T09:32:00.000Z	octoberdan	disasm	I'm trying to install a new kernel. http://paste.uni.cc/13837
2007-03-22T09:32:00.000Z	octoberdan	disasm	All of the error messages are there
2007-03-22T09:33:00.000Z	disasm	octoberdan	ls /usr/sbin/update-grub
2007-03-22T09:33:00.000Z	octoberdan	disasm	Not there
2007-03-22T09:33:00.000Z	disasm	octoberdan	i386 arch edgy?
2007-03-22T09:34:00.000Z	octoberdan	disasm	locate shows it at /sbin/update-grub
2007-03-22T09:34:00.000Z	disasm	octoberdan	did you try apt-get remove grub;apt-get install grub?
2007-03-22T09:35:00.000Z	octoberdan	disasm	Just tried that. Still fails, but with slightly different problems
2007-03-22T09:36:00.000Z	octoberdan	disasm	It doesn't complain the package doesn't exist, but "User postinst hook script [/usr/sbin/update-grub]  failed to execute: No such file or directory
2007-03-22T09:36:00.000Z	octoberdan	disasm	Should I link it?
2007-03-22T09:37:00.000Z	octoberdan	disasm	link to /sbin/update-grub from where it is looking?
2007-03-22T09:42:00.000Z	octoberdan	disasm	Linking worked. I'm going to try and reboot into the new kernel.
