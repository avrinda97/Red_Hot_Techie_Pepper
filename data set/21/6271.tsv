2010-11-07T08:50:00.000Z	TJ		I have a question.
2010-11-07T08:51:00.000Z	TJ		Does anyone know any way of saving more energy for blah bad question
2010-11-07T08:51:00.000Z	TJ		I want maximum portability.
2010-11-07T08:51:00.000Z	TJ		So does anyone know a way of conserving the most battery?
2010-11-07T08:51:00.000Z	TJ		battery energy... ?
2010-11-07T08:52:00.000Z	Gnea	TJ	turning it off
2010-11-07T08:52:00.000Z	TJ	Gnea	That wasn't a joke.
2010-11-07T08:52:00.000Z	Gnea	TJ	neither was what I suggested.
2010-11-07T08:53:00.000Z	TJ	Gnea	Please work with me here...
2010-11-07T08:53:00.000Z	Gnea	TJ	of course, you asked a rather vague question, so a vague response was appropriate.
2010-11-07T08:53:00.000Z	Gnea	TJ	seriously, turning off a laptop will conserve the battery the most
2010-11-07T08:53:00.000Z	TJ	Gnea	Thank you for your answer.
2010-11-07T08:54:00.000Z	Gnea	TJ	but you could always suspend/hibernate the system
2010-11-07T08:54:00.000Z	TJ	Gnea	I mean, .... tweaks to conserve battery power while in use.
2010-11-07T08:55:00.000Z	Gnea	TJ	oh, okay. I suggest running the least amount of processes possible. for instance, if I run too many tabs, it causes the cpufan to spin faster. this draws more power than if it was hardly spinning or not at all. it also causes the hard drive to spin more, which also draws power.
2010-11-07T08:56:00.000Z	Gnea	TJ	brightness doesn't affect battery power nearly as much as cpu-intensive processes are
2010-11-07T08:56:00.000Z	TJ	Gnea	I use an SSD.
2010-11-07T08:56:00.000Z	Gnea	TJ	oh, even better
2010-11-07T08:57:00.000Z	TJ	Gnea	My multitouch screen might be using some power... How can I turn that off on Ubuntu?
2010-11-07T09:00:00.000Z	Gnea	TJ	anyway, good luck with that, I have to bolt
2010-11-07T09:00:00.000Z	TJ	Gnea	Bye.
