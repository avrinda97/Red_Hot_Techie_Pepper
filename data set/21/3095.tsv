2009-04-08T00:05:00.000Z	moller_		How do I see if my Ubuntu is 32 bit or 64 bit?
2009-04-08T00:07:00.000Z	moller_		Okay, so I seem to have 64 bit, as uname -m returns: 1686, right?
2009-04-08T00:07:00.000Z	ikonia	moller_	no
2009-04-08T00:07:00.000Z	ikonia	moller_	tell us what you have
2009-04-08T00:12:00.000Z	ikonia	moller_	what do you want to check ?
2009-04-08T00:12:00.000Z	moller_	ikonia	Ram, but I think I've found it, if it's memory
2009-04-08T00:15:00.000Z	ikonia	moller_	the ram is not a factor to if you "can" use 64bit - why do you "want" to use 64bit ix the key factor
2009-04-08T00:16:00.000Z	ikonia	moller_	and does your processor "support" 64bit is the limiting factor
2009-04-08T00:16:00.000Z	ikonia	moller_	you're using 32bit ubuntu - so thats not a problem
2009-04-08T00:17:00.000Z	ikonia	moller_	no it doesn't
2009-04-08T00:18:00.000Z	ikonia	moller_	uname -m is correct
2009-04-08T00:18:00.000Z	moller_	ikonia	Well im trying to check my kernal
2009-04-08T00:19:00.000Z	moller_	ikonia	How would I check it then?
2009-04-08T00:19:00.000Z	ikonia	moller_	uname -m shows you the architechture
2009-04-08T00:20:00.000Z	moller_	ikonia	Well it returns i686 which is 32 bit, but doesnt that change depending on if I use 32 bit ubuntu or 64 bit?
2009-04-08T00:20:00.000Z	ikonia	moller_	that shows you are using ubuntu 32bit
2009-04-08T00:20:00.000Z	ikonia	moller_	it won't change unless you install the ubuntu 64bit distribution
2009-04-08T00:21:00.000Z	ikonia	moller_	correct
2009-04-08T00:22:00.000Z	ikonia	moller_	let me ask you this why do you "want" to use 64bit ?
2009-04-08T00:23:00.000Z	moller_	ikonia	Because I used it with Wubi, so therefore I was more used to that, and because my graphic driver seems to be messed up, so I thought it might be because of 32 bit, but I must be wrong.
2009-04-08T00:24:00.000Z	ikonia	moller_	there is no different in how you manage a 32bit/64bit desktop so you won't be used to one more than the other
