2010-03-22T19:43:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	obscurant1st	Not erally.
2010-03-22T19:43:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	obscurant1st	Out of the box, Ubuntu only offers read support.
2010-03-22T19:43:00.000Z	obscurant1st	KB1JWQ	so i cant do anything from ubuntu to create it??
2010-03-22T19:44:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	obscurant1st	You can make a new HFS+ partition with the proper tools installed and move data to it, but conversion of filesystems is rarely possible, or well advised for that matter.
2010-03-22T19:44:00.000Z	obscurant1st	KB1JWQ	i dont want to copy any data, just to create the partiion
2010-03-22T19:44:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	obscurant1st	Then yes, I *think* it's possible.
2010-03-22T19:44:00.000Z	obscurant1st	KB1JWQ	and how? :o :)
2010-03-22T19:45:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	obscurant1st	gparted does it.
2010-03-22T19:45:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	obscurant1st	Having just switched from Mac OS X to Ubuntu, I feel your pain. :-)
2010-03-22T19:46:00.000Z	obscurant1st	KB1JWQ	gparted options for hfs+ grayed out
2010-03-22T19:46:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	obscurant1st	Ah, stand by. :-)

2010-03-22T19:50:00.000Z	obscurant1st	KB1JWQ	i installed hfsutils, but still hfs+ is grayed out!
2010-03-22T19:51:00.000Z	obscurant1st	KB1JWQ	?
2010-03-22T19:55:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	obscurant1st	apt-get install  hfsplus hfsutils hfsprogs ntfsprogs
2010-03-22T19:55:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	obscurant1st	Er, the NTFS stuff is optional
2010-03-22T19:59:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	obscurant1st	Glad you got it sorted.
