2006-05-15T13:20:00.000Z	jdavila		can ubuntu be installed on my xbox???
2006-05-15T13:21:00.000Z	eobanb_	jdavila	no, not without a HUGE amount of trouble.  there are other distributions more suitable for the xbox
2006-05-15T13:22:00.000Z	jdavila	eobanb_	which distro do U suggest me????
2006-05-15T13:23:00.000Z	eobanb_	jdavila	that's kind of out of scope of this channel, but to point you in the right direction, check out http://www.xbox-linux.org/wiki/Main_Page
2006-05-15T13:33:00.000Z	eobanb_	jdavila	i'm not sure what you're asking
2006-05-15T14:19:00.000Z	eobanb_	jdavila	dapper packages are for dapper, not breezy.
2006-05-15T14:20:00.000Z	eobanb_	jdavila	if you want to use dapper packages, simply dist-upgrade
2006-05-15T14:21:00.000Z	eobanb_	jdavila	that's just a theme, it's not specific to any branch of ubuntu
2006-05-15T14:22:00.000Z	eobanb_	jdavila	i could put a desktop picture on my dapper install that says 'slackware' but that wouldnt make it slackware or break anything either
2006-05-15T14:22:00.000Z	eobanb_	jdavila	if you want a dapper kernel, then i would dist-upgrade.  the kernel is a far cry from a window theme
2006-05-15T14:23:00.000Z	jdavila	eobanb_	I tryed dist-upgrade before and broke my x-sever
2006-05-15T14:23:00.000Z	eobanb_	jdavila	well, dapper is still in development.
2006-05-15T14:24:00.000Z	jdavila	eobanb_	then i made a clean installation and worked like a charm
2006-05-15T14:25:00.000Z	eobanb_	jdavila	because microsoft has decided they dont want to release the specifications for ntfs, so to be safe, breezy can only read from ntfs, not write.
2006-05-15T14:25:00.000Z	eobanb_	jdavila	if you want r/w for ntfs, then upgrade to dapper
2006-05-15T14:26:00.000Z	jdavila	eobanb_	and why it's possible rw ntfs partitions on dapper???
2006-05-15T14:27:00.000Z	eobanb_	jdavila	because dapper is farther along in development and implements more advanced changes to that part of the kernel
2006-05-15T14:28:00.000Z	jdavila	eobanb_	but if we don't know de spec of ntfs it's not possible to implement something for it
2006-05-15T14:28:00.000Z	eobanb_	jdavila	well we're slowly figuring it out, okay?
2006-05-15T14:29:00.000Z	eobanb_	jdavila	i'm not going to sit here and argue with you about the development structure of ubuntu.  take it to -offtopic if you want
