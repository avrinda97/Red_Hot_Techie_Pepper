2008-11-19T08:44:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	conscience4	ps aux
2008-11-19T08:46:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	conscience4	if there are any ssh or telnet sessions running, and you are not running them, then someone is
2008-11-19T08:47:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	conscience4	pastebin your results of that command
2008-11-19T08:47:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	conscience4	don't worry about that

2008-11-19T09:00:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	conscience4	you do not want to restrict outbound traffic, you want to restrict inbound traffic
2008-11-19T09:00:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	conscience4	if you are trying to protect your box from intruders
2008-11-19T09:03:00.000Z	musikgoat|main	conscience4	you do not have to worry about all the processes running in the ps command, you'll spend all night wondering
