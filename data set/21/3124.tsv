2009-03-27T22:21:00.000Z	pushkalcodes		can anyone explain to me whether APT first checks out the system list for the package user wants to install or it checks out the repository first ?
2009-03-27T22:22:00.000Z	LjL	pushkalcodes	didn't understand your question.
2009-03-27T22:22:00.000Z	pushkalcodes	LjL	suppose i want to install package ABC, so first apt will check out my system for the package metadata or directly will it search the repository ?
2009-03-27T22:23:00.000Z	LjL	pushkalcodes	it will check your system, because the package information is on your system - it gets update when you "sudo apt-get update" (or automatically by the update manager, which checks it periodically)
2009-03-27T22:23:00.000Z	pushkalcodes	LjL	erUSUL: suppose i didnt update my system, and the repo has a new software, what will happen in that case ?
2009-03-27T22:24:00.000Z	LjL	pushkalcodes	it won't be installed, not before you "sudo apt-get update" your list
2009-03-27T22:25:00.000Z	pushkalcodes	LjL	shouldnt APT do an update everytime a user queries it ?
2009-03-27T22:26:00.000Z	LjL	pushkalcodes	whether it "should" is something you should ask its developers - but it does not
2009-03-27T22:26:00.000Z	LjL	pushkalcodes	ok, for some reason, your Universe repository (which contains the bulk of Ubuntu packages) isn't selected, as i suspected. i'll give you back a working version of sources.list in a moment
2009-03-27T22:26:00.000Z	pushkalcodes	LjL	I'm just suggesting... is that a bad idea ?:)
2009-03-27T22:27:00.000Z	pushkalcodes	LjL	sure, thanks .. :)
2009-03-27T22:27:00.000Z	LjL	pushkalcodes	i think so, because you might not even have working internet when you're using apt
2009-03-27T22:28:00.000Z	LjL	pushkalcodes	http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/139132/
2009-03-27T22:28:00.000Z	pushkalcodes	LjL	so the guy who dosent have internet and wants to get a new software will be quite helpless...
2009-03-27T22:28:00.000Z	LjL	pushkalcodes	also, you may want to comment out (add a #) the first line, the one about the CD-ROM, if you don't care about using the Ubuntu CD for installing stuff
2009-03-27T22:28:00.000Z	pushkalcodes	LjL	thanks !
2009-03-27T22:28:00.000Z	LjL	pushkalcodes	the guy who doesn't have internet may still have a local package cache to install from
2009-03-27T22:29:00.000Z	pushkalcodes	LjL	thats cool, you mean local cache or over a network will also do ?
2009-03-27T22:29:00.000Z	LjL	pushkalcodes	i mean local cache - if you have a local network repository, then you can update from that
2009-03-27T22:32:00.000Z	pushkalcodes	LjL	thanks for all the info !
2009-03-27T23:07:00.000Z	LjL	pushkalcodes	no, he can't, of course
