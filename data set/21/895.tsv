2011-12-18T22:22:00.000Z	spencer_		seems like my udev is missing the hid rule.. can anyone help me?
2011-12-18T22:23:00.000Z	escott	spencer_	its more likely you have something in your xmodmap that is disabling the click
2011-12-18T22:23:00.000Z	spencer_	escott	where can i config that?
2011-12-18T22:24:00.000Z	escott	spencer_	i would check if the click is appearing in xev, then start looking in your . files
2011-12-18T22:26:00.000Z	spencer_	escott	what exactly should i be searching for
2011-12-18T22:26:00.000Z	escott	spencer_	do you see the clicks in xev?
2011-12-18T22:26:00.000Z	escott	spencer_	its a command line tool
2011-12-18T22:28:00.000Z	spencer_	escott	kb and mouse movement is working.. no clicks though :(
2011-12-18T22:28:00.000Z	escott	spencer_	of any clicks or just the left?
2011-12-18T22:31:00.000Z	spencer_	escott	just left click.. and mouse btn 4
2011-12-18T22:32:00.000Z	escott	spencer_	so look at .Xmodmap, you might also investigate input settings with xinput
2011-12-18T22:33:00.000Z	spencer_	escott	where's the xinput?? in the /etc/X11/xorg.conf?
2011-12-18T22:34:00.000Z	spencer_	escott	no .Xmodmap in my home.
2011-12-18T22:34:00.000Z	escott	spencer_	xinput is another command line tool. xinput --list to get the input id xinput --list-props # to see properties. what kind of mouse is this. normal usb mouse
2011-12-18T22:36:00.000Z	spencer_	escott	it's a logitech bluetooth bundle
2011-12-18T22:41:00.000Z	spencer_	escott	found the input device.. seems like the key is mapped for the mouse.. what now?
2011-12-18T22:42:00.000Z	escott	spencer_	"the key is mapped for the mouse". I dont know what that means. you might use xinput set-props if you think it is set wrong
2011-12-18T22:43:00.000Z	spencer_	escott	currently button left is set to (124).. is that right? i don't know what's right...
2011-12-18T22:46:00.000Z	escott	spencer_	what property is this
2011-12-18T22:48:00.000Z	spencer_	escott	my xinput --list-props # showed me "Button Labels (255)" : Button Left (124)
2011-12-18T22:49:00.000Z	escott	spencer_	i don't know. i dont have that property in my synaptic
