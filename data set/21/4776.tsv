2010-06-20T13:44:00.000Z	JonathanEllis		Quanta is complaining that ~/.kde/share/config/cvsservicerc is not writable. The permissions of the file are Owner: root, Access: Read and write. Group: root, Access: None. Others, Access: None. How should I change the permissions so that quanta can write to it?
2010-06-20T13:45:00.000Z	prince_jammys	JonathanEllis	sudo chmod 750 ~/.kde/share/blahblahblah
2010-06-20T13:46:00.000Z	prince_jammys	JonathanEllis	oh, and change the owner
2010-06-20T13:46:00.000Z	prince_jammys	JonathanEllis	sudo chown youruser:youruser  ~/.kde/thefile
2010-06-20T13:46:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	prince_jammys	Thanks.
2010-06-20T13:47:00.000Z	prince_jammys		welcome. maybe you ran Quanta as root or such.
2010-06-20T13:47:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	prince_jammys	No I didnt run it as root but it is a kde application and I am running gnome so I guess something wasnt setup properly when I installed it
2010-06-20T13:51:00.000Z	prince_jammys	JonathanEllis	judging from what you said, it probably doesn't need to be executable, though it probably doesn't matter. if that bugs you, ''chmod -x thefile''
2010-06-20T13:51:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	prince_jammys	There are a bunch of other files with locked permissions in that directory. Should I change them all?
2010-06-20T13:51:00.000Z	prince_jammys	JonathanEllis	change only the owner
2010-06-20T13:51:00.000Z	JonathanEllis		Thanks
2010-06-20T13:52:00.000Z	prince_jammys	JonathanEllis	sudo chown -R youruser:youruser ~/.kde/share/the_bad_directory
2010-06-20T13:53:00.000Z	prince_jammys	JonathanEllis	this should cause no harm. i doubt that those files should be owned by anyone other than your user.
2010-06-20T13:53:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	prince_jammys	I just did sudo chown myuser:myuser path/*
2010-06-20T13:53:00.000Z	prince_jammys	JonathanEllis	that's OK.
2010-06-20T13:53:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	prince_jammys	Thanks again
2010-06-20T13:54:00.000Z	prince_jammys	JonathanEllis	well, that doesn't descend into subdirectories, btw.
2010-06-20T13:54:00.000Z	prince_jammys	JonathanEllis	if there are any, use -R
2010-06-20T13:54:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	prince_jammys	will do
2010-06-20T13:55:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	prince_jammys	And its fixed the problem. Thanks
2010-06-20T13:55:00.000Z	prince_jammys	JonathanEllis	welcome
