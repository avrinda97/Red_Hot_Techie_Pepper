2007-04-29T14:35:00.000Z	Foon		possibly a dumb question; can I write files to a samba share from my windows system without it being fat32?
2007-04-29T14:36:00.000Z	HOT	Foon	you mean from say ext3 to ntfs ?
2007-04-29T14:36:00.000Z	Foon	HOT	other way around
2007-04-29T14:36:00.000Z	Foon		I'm SSH'd into my LAMP server which I've installed Samba on
2007-04-29T14:36:00.000Z	Foon		I can't be arsed to create a fat32 partition
2007-04-29T14:37:00.000Z	HOT	Foon	you need to be able to read ntfs or your worried about the actual filesystem?
2007-04-29T14:37:00.000Z	Foon		oh
2007-04-29T14:37:00.000Z	HOT	Foon	feisty can read ntfs but not offically write to it (altough i can be enabled)
2007-04-29T14:37:00.000Z	Foon		in other words, I _have_ to use either a fat32 or ntfs partition?
2007-04-29T14:37:00.000Z	Foon	HOT	I'm running Edgy
2007-04-29T14:38:00.000Z	Foon		whoa... too much at once
2007-04-29T14:38:00.000Z	HOT	Foon	well you can get ntfs-3g , or do it the "easy" way and use automatix
2007-04-29T14:38:00.000Z	Foon	HOT	I've heard that automatix is a broken for newer revs
2007-04-29T14:39:00.000Z	Foon	HOT	also, I don't have an ntfs or fat32 partition (yet) under my linux machine
2007-04-29T14:39:00.000Z	Foon		ideally I'd like to avoid doing that, out of pure lazyness
2007-04-29T14:39:00.000Z	HOT	Foon	couldnt say, automatix 2 for feisty gave me ntfs write, doing it the proper way shouldnt be too hard though, might need a kernal patch?
2007-04-29T14:39:00.000Z	HOT		erm kernel
2007-04-29T14:39:00.000Z	Foon		so I should just update to Feisty?
2007-04-29T14:40:00.000Z	HOT	Foon	thats a pretty drastic step just for ntfs, might be worth reading about ntfs-3g first
2007-04-29T14:40:00.000Z	Foon		also, is ntfs write reliable? I ask because I know there's a major difference between something being unsupported, and that same thing functioning as expected regardless of unsupportedness
2007-04-29T14:41:00.000Z	HOT	Foon	i dont have a problem with it, i wouldnt use it on a server though, not yet anyway
