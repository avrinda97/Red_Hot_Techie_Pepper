2007-01-16T17:42:00.000Z	PhibreOptix	Antony	It's gotta be allowed through the router, and make sure that the program is using a constant port, not a random one
2007-01-16T17:43:00.000Z	PhibreOptix	Antony	As in one that doesn't change when the program starts, alot of bittorrent software does that, so set it to some port like 6545, the forward that through your router and reboot it
2007-01-16T17:44:00.000Z	PhibreOptix	Antony	So the port isn't changing? If it isn't, what software are you using?
2007-01-16T17:45:00.000Z	PhibreOptix	Antony	*Shudders* anyway, most bittorrent software works on a sharing basis, so if your blocking all uploads from it, then your download rate will be hampered
2007-01-16T17:46:00.000Z	PhibreOptix	Antony	Then switch to BitLord if your using windows, I used that when I was on windows and it almost always went full speed
2007-01-16T17:48:00.000Z	PhibreOptix	Antony	Yes
2007-01-16T17:51:00.000Z	PhibreOptix	Antony	Then they will probably just go slower
2007-01-16T17:57:00.000Z	PhibreOptix	Antony	Google.com Search for BitLord download
2007-01-16T06:01:00.000Z	PhibreOptix	Antony	A linux distribution
2007-01-16T06:05:00.000Z	PhibreOptix	Antony	google.com   define:Ubuntu
2007-01-16T06:09:00.000Z	PhibreOptix	Antony	Because your in a freaking ubuntu IRC channel
