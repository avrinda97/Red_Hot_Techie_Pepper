2011-01-28T12:34:00.000Z	mythid		Can anyone help me out with a question
2011-01-28T12:34:00.000Z	mythid		It has to do with me trying to install lubuntu
2011-01-28T12:34:00.000Z	mythid		I think i screwed up the pc i tried to do it with
2011-01-28T12:35:00.000Z	mythid		Ok well still
2011-01-28T12:35:00.000Z	mythid		basically what i did is made a whole partition for the install of lubuntu and the installer failed, faulty disc or whatever and shut me down. Now i boot up and don't get a splash screen or anything just a black screen with a blinking cursor
2011-01-28T12:36:00.000Z	mythid		lubuntu is a lighter form of ubuntu because i was using my old pc for this
2011-01-28T12:36:00.000Z	soreau	mythid	Try the installer again?
2011-01-28T12:39:00.000Z	soreau	mythid	Do you see your bios splash screen?
2011-01-28T12:40:00.000Z	mythid	soreau	nope
2011-01-28T12:40:00.000Z	soreau	mythid	Well that's probably not good. Might want to ask in #hardware
2011-01-28T12:41:00.000Z	soreau	mythid	/j #hardware
2011-01-28T12:42:00.000Z	soreau	mythid	##hardware
2011-01-28T12:58:00.000Z	soreau	mythid	#hardware is probably for freenode staff or some other non-public chat
2011-01-28T13:30:00.000Z	soreau	mythid	Why not get 10.10?
2011-01-28T14:21:00.000Z	mythid	soreau	it's taking a while to load after i hit forward on the install is that normal?
2011-01-28T14:22:00.000Z	soreau	mythid	install for what?
2011-01-28T14:09:00.000Z	soreau	mythid	Which wifi chip is it from lspci?
2011-01-28T14:09:00.000Z	soreau	mythid	Does iwconfig show a wireless iface?
2011-01-28T14:12:00.000Z	soreau	mythid	Does iwconfig show a wireless interface?
2011-01-28T14:13:00.000Z	soreau	mythid	Try sudo iwlist wlan0 scan|grep -i ssid
2011-01-28T14:14:00.000Z	soreau	mythid	read, experiment, learn.
