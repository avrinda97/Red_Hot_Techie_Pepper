2007-01-15T07:54:00.000Z	mackin		no ideas?
2007-01-15T07:54:00.000Z	CyberCod	mackin	you'll want to             sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf   and save a backup before you change anything... and see if the other resolutions are in there in the screen section... if not, you may have to add them
2007-01-15T07:57:00.000Z	CyberCod	mackin	did you put it in the same format as the other entries?
2007-01-15T08:12:00.000Z	CyberCod	mackin	it should be down there near where the resolutions are
2007-01-15T08:12:00.000Z	CyberCod	mackin	poste your xorg.conf up on pastebin and let us have a look at it
2007-01-15T08:19:00.000Z	CyberCod	mackin	you there?
2007-01-15T08:20:00.000Z	CyberCod	mackin	you'll want to make a backup of how it is now, by using the command     sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf_backup
2007-01-15T08:25:00.000Z	CyberCod	mackin	what happened?
2007-01-15T08:33:00.000Z	CyberCod	mackin	 did you go for dual boot? or linux only?
2007-01-15T08:34:00.000Z	CyberCod	mackin	I'll tell you now, you're linux experience is going to be jaded so long as you are using ATI, or until they get off their butts and fix their crapware drivers
2007-01-15T08:35:00.000Z	CyberCod	mackin	I had radeon 9250... in fact i'm still wrestling with it in mint linux on my in-laws machine... and when i switched to an nvidia card, my problems miraculously vanished
2007-01-15T08:55:00.000Z	mackin	CyberCod	switching the config from ATI destroyed my install
2007-01-15T08:58:00.000Z	CyberCod	mackin	it's not dead.. hollar when you get back
2007-01-15T09:14:00.000Z	CyberCod	mackin	whas up?
