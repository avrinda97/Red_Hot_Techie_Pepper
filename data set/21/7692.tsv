2006-08-05T16:31:00.000Z	Tamale		someone else was asking about transparent terminals too.
2006-08-05T07:21:00.000Z	Tamale		funny problem - how can i convince my ubuntu install that it doesn't need to upgrade from 2.6.15.26-686 to  2.6.15.26-386?
2006-08-05T07:22:00.000Z	django_	Tamale	why don't you uninstall it?
2006-08-05T07:22:00.000Z	django_	Tamale	through synaptic so it gets all the dependencies (headers etc) out
2006-08-05T07:23:00.000Z	django_	Tamale	otherwise it'll try to update the modules, headers etc everytime you dist-upgrade
2006-08-05T07:23:00.000Z	Tamale	django_	so what's the command i should use to remove?
2006-08-05T07:23:00.000Z	django_	Tamale	you are using a wm? through synaptic
2006-08-05T07:23:00.000Z	Tamale	django_	thanks man
2006-08-05T07:24:00.000Z	django_	Tamale	search for all the 386 stuff, start marking for uninstall, and it'll get the others
2006-08-05T07:25:00.000Z	django_	Tamale	little hint; if you want to install packages, then have it's dependencies removed if you delete it, use aptitude to install
2006-08-05T07:26:00.000Z	django_	Tamale	same happens here, it doesn't properly remove some stuff
2006-08-05T07:27:00.000Z	Tamale	django_	ok, that's fine.  just wanted to make sure i'm not the only one with the problem
2006-08-05T07:27:00.000Z	django_	Tamale	but when i checked, for some reason, some packages i had installed were dependant upon that openoffice stuff
2006-08-05T07:27:00.000Z	Tamale	django_	Hopefully i can find them and flush them out then
2006-08-05T07:27:00.000Z	django_	Tamale	yeah, that's my next mission
2006-08-05T07:28:00.000Z	Tamale	django_	well, for one, i notice they're all still in the menu
2006-08-05T07:29:00.000Z	django_	Tamale	in the end i left what was there, because like Jack_Sparrow i had problems
2006-08-05T07:31:00.000Z	django_	Tamale	for me it's like the thesaurus and help files want to stay
2006-08-05T07:31:00.000Z	django_	Tamale	when i remove them i get all sorts of strange dependency problems
