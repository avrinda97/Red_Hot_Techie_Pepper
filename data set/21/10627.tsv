2005-01-15T09:54:00.000Z	copulatin		i just want to try the live cd but can't find the default username or password for it anywhere
2005-01-15T09:55:00.000Z	mon	copulatin	what do you mean password?
2005-01-15T09:56:00.000Z	mon	copulatin	then it doesn't need a password?
2005-01-15T09:58:00.000Z	mon	copulatin	weird videocard perhaps?

2005-01-15T09:59:00.000Z	copulatin	mon	yeah that i ordered...i got 5 in the mail
2005-01-15T10:00:00.000Z	copulatin	mon	 is there any known problems with vmware and the livecd?
2005-01-15T10:02:00.000Z	mon	copulatin	you dont use the livecd with vmware, you reboot your pc with that cd in drive. doesn't touch your hardware
2005-01-15T10:02:00.000Z	copulatin	mon	i know i was just testing it in vmware, i've never had a problem with other livecds running in it
2005-01-15T10:02:00.000Z	copulatin	mon	yep
2005-01-15T10:03:00.000Z	copulatin	mon	that and i'm at work so i need windows up
2005-01-15T10:03:00.000Z	mon	copulatin	shouldn't you be working then?
2005-01-15T10:03:00.000Z	copulatin	mon	i am working i'm trying to find a good livecd to use internally to run an ica client thorugh it
2005-01-15T10:04:00.000Z	copulatin	mon	we have crappy computers here that need to connect to citrix so we are trying to find a good distro to use
2005-01-15T10:05:00.000Z	mon	copulatin	well i guess it should run from within vmware, why not just try it. but if it's for work i'd still reboot, its slow enough already
2005-01-15T10:06:00.000Z	copulatin	mon	it runs fine on a normal pc just not in vmware wierd....this is the first livecd i've seen fail
2005-01-15T10:07:00.000Z	mon	copulatin	any error msgs?
2005-01-15T10:07:00.000Z	copulatin	mon	nope on a pc it booted fine
2005-01-15T10:07:00.000Z	copulatin	mon	into the gui, in vmware it boots to a username prompt
2005-01-15T10:08:00.000Z	mon	copulatin	don't know, sorry
2005-01-15T10:09:00.000Z	copulatin	mon	no problem thanks for the help
