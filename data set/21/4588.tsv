2008-04-30T01:38:00.000Z	Rockj		hum, I get access denied when trying to share folders in ubuntu 8.04? I'm missing something?
2008-04-30T01:39:00.000Z	jaffarkelshac	Rockj	do you own the folder?
2008-04-30T01:39:00.000Z	Rockj	jaffarkelshac	yes I own the folder.
2008-04-30T01:39:00.000Z	jaffarkelshac		that means it can be installed with synaptics gorgon
2008-04-30T01:40:00.000Z	Rockj	jaffarkelshac	I right clicked the folder and went to shared tab, it installed the required packages to use samba sharing but it gives me an error about I need the correct access to use samba sharing.
2008-04-30T01:40:00.000Z	Rockj	jaffarkelshac	afaik - Im added in it.
2008-04-30T01:41:00.000Z	Rockj	jaffarkelshac	I'm added in group sambashare so I assume it should work
2008-04-30T01:41:00.000Z	Rockj	jaffarkelshac	 /var/lib/samba shows this for usershares folder:   drwxrwx--T  2 root sambashare  4096 2008-04-29 22:23 usershares
2008-04-30T01:42:00.000Z	jaffarkelshac		it should, someone had the same problem, i checked their smb.conf and but was still not able to share,i think is abug  Rockj
2008-04-30T01:43:00.000Z	Rockj	jaffarkelshac	oki. I'll see if I can find some other samba software that can do it easily for me - im to "lazy" to dig into smb.conf atm. :)
2008-04-30T01:43:00.000Z	Rockj	jaffarkelshac	(needed to share files over to a mac, I guess I'll just use scp instead ;))
2008-04-30T01:43:00.000Z	jaffarkelshac		what is scp?
2008-04-30T01:44:00.000Z	jaffarkelshac		you could use sshfs Rockj
2008-04-30T01:44:00.000Z	Rockj	jaffarkelshac	secure copy.  (same as cp, just copying over ssh from and to remote hosts)
2008-04-30T01:44:00.000Z	Rockj	jaffarkelshac	approxly the same as sshfs, just that a mac doesn't have ssh installed, but they have a ssh client ;-)
2008-04-30T01:45:00.000Z	jaffarkelshac		i see Rockj
2008-04-30T01:47:00.000Z	Rockj	jaffarkelshac	http://www.linuxtutorialblog.com/post/ssh-and-scp-howto-tips-tricks  - ctrl+f and search for scp and read if your interessted. A must "know" for linux friends ;-)
2008-04-30T01:48:00.000Z	jaffarkelshac		cheers, Rockj i learn something everyday
2008-04-30T01:50:00.000Z	Rockj	jaffarkelshac	your welcome. I know how to setup samba manually, but I normally tech servers and for desktop use I want it to be done with a simple "click" without having to configure and fiddling so much :)
2008-04-30T01:51:00.000Z	jaffarkelshac		1 think i have realise with linux is somethings take a long time to setup when a click could do it Rockj
2008-04-30T01:52:00.000Z	Rockj	jaffarkelshac	most stuff is not hard to setup - samba could be abit chruncy if you don't know the settings you are setting. I got settings laying around, but I prefer it to be friendly accessible on a desktop computer.
