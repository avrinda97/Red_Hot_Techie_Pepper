2010-10-25T07:44:00.000Z	dr4c4n	Luija1006	yes Gnu Image manipulation progrm
2010-10-25T07:46:00.000Z	dr4c4n	Luija1006	are you taking out an entire object or just blurring something?
2010-10-25T07:47:00.000Z	dr4c4n	Luija1006	is it ok for me to pm you? Perhaps I can help you through the steps of acquiring gimp?
2010-10-25T07:48:00.000Z	Luija1006	dr4c4n	sudo aptitude install gimp?
2010-10-25T07:48:00.000Z	Luija1006	dr4c4n	thanks for your help buddie :)

2010-10-25T07:52:00.000Z	dr4c4n	Luija1006	see this: http://www.recipester.org/Recipe:Create_frosted_pixels_effect_32639875
2010-10-25T07:53:00.000Z	dr4c4n	Luija1006	or this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ML2oAQ0PvKk
2010-10-25T07:54:00.000Z	dr4c4n	Luija1006	the best reference is the gimp pages: http://docs.gimp.org/en/filters-blur.html
2010-10-25T07:55:00.000Z	dr4c4n	Luija1006	what you want is the Pixellize filter after you make your selection with the selection tool
2010-10-25T07:56:00.000Z	dr4c4n	Luija1006	that's if you want the censored area to have squares - for irregular blobs - use oilify
2010-10-25T07:58:00.000Z	dr4c4n	Luija1006	everything okay now? I must go afk shortly
2010-10-25T07:58:00.000Z	Luija1006	dr4c4n	all ok, thanks dude!
