2011-05-19T05:38:00.000Z	blazecon	szal	i think my net crashed for a moment, the download was just interrupted somehow
2011-05-19T05:39:00.000Z	szal	blazecon	tried force-reinstalling KMix?
2011-05-19T05:40:00.000Z	szal	blazecon	preferably on the cmdline

2011-05-19T05:40:00.000Z	szal	blazecon	did it help?
2011-05-19T05:41:00.000Z	blazecon	szal	: no it said it was interrupted
2011-05-19T05:41:00.000Z	szal	blazecon	what exactly did it say?
2011-05-19T05:42:00.000Z	blazecon	szal	you must manualy run 'sudo dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem. do i just type that in?
2011-05-19T05:43:00.000Z	blazecon	szal	failed to write, no space...
2011-05-19T05:43:00.000Z	szal	blazecon	sounds like partitioning fail
2011-05-19T05:44:00.000Z	blazecon	szal	its running off a flashdrive
2011-05-19T05:44:00.000Z	szal	blazecon	then the flash drive is too small

2011-05-19T05:44:00.000Z	blazecon	szal	im trying to see hom much space is left, its a 4G
2011-05-19T05:47:00.000Z	szal	blazecon	4 GB is way too little, you shouldn't start under 10 GB
