2009-10-15T04:49:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u		thanks
2009-10-15T04:50:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u		ok anyone know of a new lightweight browser
2009-10-15T04:50:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u		I hate opera and firefox 3.5
2009-10-15T04:52:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u		thanks IdleOne and foofish
2009-10-15T04:54:00.000Z	vox	U-b-u-n-t-u	it's nothing to do with the browser
2009-10-15T04:54:00.000Z	vox	U-b-u-n-t-u	linux uses ram in a different way to windows
2009-10-15T04:56:00.000Z	vox	U-b-u-n-t-u	if you run 'top' from a shell while you have opera/firefox open, you'll see that the majority of your ram is being used as 'cache'
2009-10-15T04:56:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	vox	oh?
2009-10-15T04:56:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	vox	I didnt know that
2009-10-15T04:56:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	vox	so its normal?
2009-10-15T04:57:00.000Z	vox	U-b-u-n-t-u	completely
2009-10-15T04:58:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u		ok vox so high levels of cache are normal and I shouldnt be concerned its not a hardware issue or software just the way ubuntu uses cache
2009-10-15T04:58:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u		aha!
2009-10-15T04:58:00.000Z	vox	U-b-u-n-t-u	exactly. it's not just ubuntu, it's the way every form of linux works
2009-10-15T04:58:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u		reinstalling firefox =_=
2009-10-15T04:59:00.000Z	vox	U-b-u-n-t-u	think of it as "well, nothing else needs it right now, so i'm going to use it to make everything faster"
2009-10-15T05:00:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u		right now with xchat and pidgin ram is at 23% and cache 13% but if I open firefox and surf the ram shoots up to like 50%-70% cache like 98%
2009-10-15T05:00:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u		I should mention I am using 64 bit
2009-10-15T05:01:00.000Z	vox	U-b-u-n-t-u	thats normal. pidgin and x-chat aren't programs that require "room to move" so to speak
2009-10-15T05:01:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	vox	ok
