2007-03-22T15:53:00.000Z	Federico90		anyone?
2007-03-22T15:54:00.000Z	billy	Federico90	I have a p5L.  similar, but not exactly, I guess.
2007-03-22T15:54:00.000Z	Federico90	billy	i can't configure my wireless
2007-03-22T15:55:00.000Z	Federico90	billy	he doesn't find the ap
2007-03-22T15:55:00.000Z	Federico90	billy	i've tried all guides
2007-03-22T15:55:00.000Z	billy	Federico90	well, you can check that ubotu link above.  I frankly have ZERO experience with wireless, except for my mouse, that is.  I understand Feisty will have much better wireless support, but I don't recommend upgrading until the 19th.
2007-03-22T15:57:00.000Z	billy	Federico90	wish I could help more.  Just no experience.
2007-03-22T15:58:00.000Z	Federico90	billy	tnx
2007-03-22T15:58:00.000Z	billy	Federico90	the most I can do is help you understand the guide.  I've never walked through it myself, so it'll be the blind leading the blind.  :(((
2007-03-22T15:58:00.000Z	billy	Federico90	later on in the day there are super good folks in here.
2007-03-22T15:59:00.000Z	billy	Federico90	there are great folks here now, but seems like there are "official" folks here after sunrise.
2007-03-22T06:07:00.000Z	Federico90	billy	i've tried the web page, but it explains the same steps
2007-03-22T06:08:00.000Z	billy	Federico90	you're gonna have to give me some background, my homey.  Not sure where you're coming from.  What web page are you referring to?
2007-03-22T06:08:00.000Z	Federico90	billy	this --> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WLANHowTo
2007-03-22T06:10:00.000Z	Federico90	billy	someone else who knows wireless troubleshot?
2007-03-22T06:10:00.000Z	billy	Federico90	someone in here should.   Or maybe try back a little later.
2007-03-22T06:10:00.000Z	billy	Federico90	it's still pretty early on the West Coast of the USA.
2007-03-22T06:12:00.000Z	Federico90	billy	what time is there?
