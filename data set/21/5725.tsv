2007-08-21T09:47:00.000Z	El_Julioso		hey all
2007-08-21T09:49:00.000Z	El_Julioso		I'm switching to Ubuntu this week, I'm wondering if it will have any trouble reading the two drives I use for storage, they're in RAID 0 controlled by a SIL 3114 PCI SATA controller
2007-08-21T09:51:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	El_Julioso	Yes, I think you will have a problem
2007-08-21T09:52:00.000Z	El_Julioso	Jack_Sparrow	thanks, I've been hearing about RAID headaches with Linux, any idea how to solve it?
2007-08-21T09:53:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	El_Julioso	Personally, I used raid back when drives were a lot slower.  It isnt as much of an issue now
2007-08-21T09:54:00.000Z	El_Julioso	Jack_Sparrow	yeah, I would like to revert back to non-RAID, since I don't trust hard drives that much, main problem is I have over 500GB of stuff on those two drives and have no easy way to save it all :(
2007-08-21T09:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	El_Julioso	I saw a 500 gig single drive at frys this week for about $100
2007-08-21T09:56:00.000Z	El_Julioso	Jack_Sparrow	hmmm... good point! I think I'm just gonna get a new HD and PSU
2007-08-21T09:56:00.000Z	El_Julioso	Jack_Sparrow	It's a good excuse to finally exceed 1TB of storage :D
2007-08-21T09:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	El_Julioso	 There are other ways, but that one gives you a nice bonus when you are done
2007-08-21T09:57:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	El_Julioso	We are here to help if you need anything.  are you running wireless?
2007-08-21T09:57:00.000Z	El_Julioso	Jack_Sparrow	This is true, I don't know why I didn't think of it, thanks for the suggestion
2007-08-21T09:58:00.000Z	El_Julioso	Jack_Sparrow	I am indeed running wireless internet
2007-08-21T09:58:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	El_Julioso	Check on your cards chipset, that would be the only other serious hangup...
2007-08-21T09:59:00.000Z	El_Julioso	Jack_Sparrow	yeah, I went to the Linksys site and checked it out, looks like I need to download another driver, shouldn't be a big deal
2007-08-21T10:00:00.000Z	El_Julioso	Jack_Sparrow	What do you think of file systems? I've read that jfs is good, but not a lot of people use it
2007-08-21T10:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	El_Julioso	Great... good luck..
2007-08-21T10:01:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	El_Julioso	I stick with the default and I have never had any issues with it.  I dual boot.. I have ntfs for windows, a shared fat32 and a spare ext3 for extra ubuntu storage and images...
2007-08-21T10:04:00.000Z	El_Julioso	Jack_Sparrow	Thanks a lot, can't wait to get rid of my bloated Windows install, I'll know where to come if I have any more issues
2007-08-21T10:04:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	El_Julioso	Just remember to please be patient... this place can get very busy...
2007-08-21T10:06:00.000Z	El_Julioso	Jack_Sparrow	absolutely. Cheers
