2006-03-27T11:10:00.000Z	topyli	ILIJA	if you mean redhat-style source cd-roms, i don't think there are any
2006-03-27T11:12:00.000Z	ILIJA	topyli	where can i find some others
2006-03-27T11:12:00.000Z	topyli	ILIJA	sources for other distros?
2006-03-27T11:13:00.000Z	topyli	ILIJA	debian sources are the most available, and they have pretty much every piece of free software there is
2006-03-27T11:15:00.000Z	topyli	ILIJA	editors? there are dozens of them. vim and emacs are the biggies
2006-03-27T11:15:00.000Z	topyli	ILIJA	him? i thought you were talking about text editors :)

2006-03-27T11:18:00.000Z	topyli	ILIJA	emacs from gnu.org. it's best to use the software your linux distro will provide
2006-03-27T11:18:00.000Z	topyli	ILIJA	perhaps you were not talking about source code after all, but just want to get the linux system?
2006-03-27T11:19:00.000Z	topyli	ILIJA	you want to put linux on your computer?
2006-03-27T11:19:00.000Z	topyli	ILIJA	great!

2006-03-27T11:26:00.000Z	topyli	ILIJA	i'm trying to find a good mailing list you could write
2006-03-27T11:26:00.000Z	topyli	ILIJA	join #ubuntu-offtopic, it's this busy
