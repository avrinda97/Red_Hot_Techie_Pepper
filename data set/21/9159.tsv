2008-12-13T23:04:00.000Z	bulio		How can I access a windows share on ubuntu?
2008-12-13T23:05:00.000Z	bulio		I installed smbfs and tried to put a line in /etc/fstab
2008-12-13T23:05:00.000Z	bulio		//192.168.0.197/Volume_1  /media/nas  cifs  credentials=~/.smbcredentials,dmask=777,fmask=777  0  0
2008-12-13T23:05:00.000Z	bulio		anyone see anything with that?
2008-12-13T23:06:00.000Z	bulio		and is smbfs the proper thing to install for cifs?
2008-12-13T23:06:00.000Z	LjL	bulio	yes
2008-12-13T23:06:00.000Z	bulio	LjL	then what could I be doing wrong
2008-12-13T23:07:00.000Z	LjL	bulio	don't know. does .smbcredentials exist and is readable?
2008-12-13T23:07:00.000Z	bulio	LjL	yep
2008-12-13T23:07:00.000Z	LjL	bulio	try mounting it manually with sudo mount //192.168.0.197/Volume_1 /media/nas -o username=whatever
2008-12-13T23:08:00.000Z	bulio	LjL	its set to be only readable by sudo
2008-12-13T23:08:00.000Z	bulio	LjL	manually mounting works fine
2008-12-13T23:09:00.000Z	LjL	bulio	oh wait, duh, i know what's wrong of course...
2008-12-13T23:09:00.000Z	LjL	bulio	you put ~/.smbcredentials but what is ~ when root is reading fstab?
2008-12-13T23:09:00.000Z	bulio	LjL	I assume my primary user?
2008-12-13T23:09:00.000Z	LjL	bulio	no
2008-12-13T23:10:00.000Z	LjL	bulio	root has got its own home directory, /root/
2008-12-13T23:10:00.000Z	LjL	bulio	so it'll look for /root/.smbcredentials
2008-12-13T23:10:00.000Z	bulio	LjL	so I should move it there?
2008-12-13T23:10:00.000Z	LjL	bulio	or you should specify a different path in fstab
2008-12-13T23:11:00.000Z	bulio	LjL	alright, I'll try that
