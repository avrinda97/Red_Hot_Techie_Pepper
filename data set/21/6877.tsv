2007-01-12T07:31:00.000Z	CyfrMonk		Has anyone else had trouble with the latest xorg drivers breaking OpenGL? I'm using nvidia binary drivers (from envy)
2007-01-12T07:32:00.000Z	hakrzcode	CyfrMonk	when you do an update of Xorg, you should reinstall your nvidia drivers, it will mess up your libraries, and cause x to crash with opengl apps.
2007-01-12T07:33:00.000Z	CyfrMonk	hakrzcode	I reinstalled binary nvidia drivers, but opengl is still broken (crashes X)
2007-01-12T07:34:00.000Z	CyfrMonk	hakrzcode	this happend after I installed the patches today (think they came out yesterday)
2007-01-12T07:35:00.000Z	hakrzcode	CyfrMonk	yes, this happened with me, usually after an X update, when I used Nvidia.
2007-01-12T07:44:00.000Z	hakrzcode	CyfrMonk	look in your ~/.xsession-errors
2007-01-12T07:54:00.000Z	CyfrMonk	hakrzcode	you the one that told me to post my xsession-errors to pastebin? I crashed X and didn't have logging on ...
2007-01-12T07:54:00.000Z	hakrzcode	CyfrMonk	it crashed before logging in?
2007-01-12T07:56:00.000Z	hakrzcode	CyfrMonk	if you can switch to Console, before you log back in, then copy the .xsession-errors to another file, then log in, then it will be better. .xsession-errors gets rewritten everytime you log in.
2007-01-12T07:56:00.000Z	CyfrMonk	hakrzcode	yea - I realized that so I did just that - the file is at http://pastebin.com/857274
2007-01-12T07:57:00.000Z	CyfrMonk	hakrzcode	I also diff'd my xorg.conf against the backup copy that was made before the xorg patch today and it shows no differences
2007-01-12T07:58:00.000Z	hakrzcode	CyfrMonk	pastbin.com, does not like me for some reason, please use http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/
2007-01-12T07:58:00.000Z	hakrzcode	CyfrMonk	yes, Xorg.log is only for the startup of X.
2007-01-12T07:59:00.000Z	CyfrMonk	hakrzcode	I think the error line is: Vte-WARNING **: No handler for control sequence `device-control-string' defined.
2007-01-12T07:59:00.000Z	CyfrMonk	hakrzcode	everything else looks "normal"
2007-01-12T08:01:00.000Z	CyfrMonk	hakrzcode	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/1254/    man that site is faster ... they must run on ubuntu ;)
2007-01-12T08:01:00.000Z	CyfrMonk	hakrzcode	the "bad device errors" near the middle are because I don't have my wacom plugged in - they happen all the time
2007-01-12T08:04:00.000Z	hakrzcode	CyfrMonk	I am looking on Nvidia linux forum.
2007-01-12T08:05:00.000Z	CyfrMonk	hakrzcode	I can dig around - couldn't find anything about it on ubuntuforums so thought I'd jump on and see if anyone here had the problem
2007-01-12T08:06:00.000Z	hakrzcode	CyfrMonk	no problem.
2007-01-12T08:06:00.000Z	CyfrMonk	hakrzcode	it only started after todays xorg patch
