2009-08-28T01:42:00.000Z	Sam___		i have another error, authentication token manipulation error...when i use the command passwd with a user already created
2009-08-28T01:44:00.000Z	Sam___		i write su, then ask me for the password, i write it, and try to change the password from other user with: passwd accountname
2009-08-28T01:46:00.000Z	nsp	Sam___	Are you changing the password to the user account that you are currently logged into?
2009-08-28T01:46:00.000Z	nsp	Sam___	 If so, just use command passwd
2009-08-28T01:49:00.000Z	nsp	Sam___	 First make sure the user account exists and you remember;  ls /home  ;  and then just use the command passwd <user-name>
2009-08-28T01:50:00.000Z	nsp	Sam___	If the prompt ends with  #  you are already root. (You already have root priviledges).
2009-08-28T01:54:00.000Z	Sam___	nsp	the acount exists, because, i used it yesterday, but then i downloaded and installed the updates; and now i can login, only on recovery mode
2009-08-28T01:55:00.000Z	Sam___	nsp	now i can't login, sorry, my mistake
2009-08-28T01:55:00.000Z	nsp	Sam___	And... you have also forgotten the password? Or...?
2009-08-28T01:56:00.000Z	nsp	Sam___	What is the reason for changing password?
2009-08-28T01:56:00.000Z	Sam___	nsp	no, but i thought about changin it, because, when i try to login it says Login Failed
2009-08-28T01:57:00.000Z	nsp	Sam___	See if the user directory still exists:  ls /home
2009-08-28T01:58:00.000Z	nsp	Sam___	And then do  su - <user-name>
2009-08-28T01:59:00.000Z	nsp	Sam___	At what point is it not allowing you to log in?  (Is it the GUI login screen?)
2009-08-28T02:01:00.000Z	Sam___	nsp	actually my problem is that the normal mode (the gui) doesn't accept the password for root or the other administrator user; and it happens since i update my operating system... i did logged in with a user from the domain, but when i try to install something, ask me for the password of an administrator, and it says that is incorrect
2009-08-28T02:02:00.000Z	nsp	Sam___	The password you use is just the user password.  If you don't know it, change it now that you are in recovery mode.
2009-08-28T02:02:00.000Z	nsp	Sam___	And you can not log into the GUI as root.  (You can
2009-08-28T02:03:00.000Z	nsp	Sam___	And you can not log into the GUI as root.  (You can't log in as root under any circumstance, ubuntu does not allow root login by default.)
2009-08-28T02:03:00.000Z	nsp	Sam___	You need to log in under the primary user's username.
2009-08-28T02:05:00.000Z	nsp	Sam___	 What ever the first user was, is what I am calling "primary user".  (If you have added a second or third user, those will not be afforded admin privileges unless you make those changes yourself.)
2009-08-28T02:06:00.000Z	Sam___	nsp	i'm not in recovery mode, i'm in the session of the domain user with no provileges for administration or installation... in recovery mode, i login with root and it accept the password that i know, but in normal mode, doesn't accept that password... and if i try in recovery mode, of set the passsword for the primary user, it says the error;: authentication token manipulation error
