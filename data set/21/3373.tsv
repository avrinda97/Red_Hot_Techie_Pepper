2011-03-12T00:39:00.000Z	MeanEYE	liddell	hi
2011-03-12T00:41:00.000Z	MeanEYE	liddell	/etc/NetworkManager/nm-system-settings.conf?
2011-03-12T00:42:00.000Z	MeanEYE	liddell	sudo dpkg-reconfigure network-manager
2011-03-12T00:43:00.000Z	MeanEYE	liddell	np
2011-03-12T00:53:00.000Z	liddell	MeanEYE	So it did not seem to create the file, but it did create NetworkManager.conf, which has inside of it the tag I need to change to fix the issue [change managed=false to managed=true]. But I try to open it with a sudo Kate and it just says "No protocol specified. kate:cannot connect to X server :0"
2011-03-12T00:54:00.000Z	MeanEYE	liddell	gksu kate , sudo is terminal command
2011-03-12T01:07:00.000Z	liddell	MeanEYE	Okay I don't have gksu installed, but I used Nano to edit the file and got the ethernet working, but the wireless is still missing. I vaugely recall last time this happened having to enable something by editing another file, something having to do with interfaces and eth0, eth1, etc. Any insight there? If not, thanks for your help up to this point!
2011-03-12T01:10:00.000Z	MeanEYE	liddell	can you fill me in again what is it you are trying to do... I keep forgetting, sorry
2011-03-12T01:12:00.000Z	MeanEYE	liddell	ok got it... /etc/network/interfaces
2011-03-12T01:13:00.000Z	liddell	MeanEYE	Whenever I do a hard reboot, my network manager says everything is 'Unmanaged" and I have to go into configuration files to change lines that say "mangaged=false" to managed=true" to get it up again, but it only seems to be fixing the ethernet connection this time around, and I would guess that it's because I deleted the Network manager config file earlier. [it's back now]
2011-03-12T01:14:00.000Z	MeanEYE	liddell	do you have gnome? because network manager could do all this for you automatically
2011-03-12T01:16:00.000Z	liddell	MeanEYE	I don't. [I'm in here because the Kubuntu channel is silent.] But I've had this exact same problem several times with GNOME as well...
2011-03-12T01:17:00.000Z	MeanEYE	liddell	well /etc/network/interfaces is the file you are looking for
2011-03-12T01:18:00.000Z	liddell	MeanEYE	So I've got /etc/network/interfaces open in nano. Is there a place you might know of on the web where I can find what it's supposed to look like? Or I could transcribe it here if you know how to parse it...
2011-03-12T01:18:00.000Z	MeanEYE	liddell	sure let me find it
2011-03-12T01:18:00.000Z	MeanEYE	liddell	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=10078
2011-03-12T01:32:00.000Z	liddell	MeanEYE	I'm trying to figure out how to add a wireless interface here in the /etc/network/interfaces file and I can't seem to pin it down. I tried adding another few lines to it only changing the eth0 to eth1, but that just added another wired connection...
2011-03-12T01:33:00.000Z	MeanEYE	liddell	ifconfig -a will list all interfaces
2011-03-12T01:34:00.000Z	liddell	MeanEYE	okay I have eth0 and lo [I deleted the extra wired one I added already]
2011-03-12T01:34:00.000Z	MeanEYE	liddell	I've never configured wlan that way... only lan
