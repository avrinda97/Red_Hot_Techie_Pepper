2007-03-23T13:46:00.000Z	wire93		i need help configuring a static ip on ubuntu-server 6.10
2007-03-23T13:48:00.000Z	wire93		does anyone have experience setting up static ip addresses?
2007-03-23T13:48:00.000Z	soundray	wire93	don't ask an anyone question. Ask a How do I question
2007-03-23T13:50:00.000Z	soundray	wire93	System-Administration-Networking, there you can choose an interface and configure it with static addresses
2007-03-23T13:51:00.000Z	soundray	wire93	in that case, you should edit /etc/network/interfaces. There are docs in man interfaces and samples on the wiki
2007-03-23T13:52:00.000Z	soundray	wire93	look here: http://textsnippets.com/posts/show/319  -- the eth0 section
2007-03-23T13:53:00.000Z	soundray	wire93	so what happens when you run 'sudo ifup eth0'
2007-03-23T13:55:00.000Z	soundray	wire93	are you ignoring me now?
2007-03-23T13:55:00.000Z	wire93	soundray	i just brought it down, sudo ifup eth1, it takes a long time for it to work
2007-03-23T13:56:00.000Z	wire93	soundray	it doesnt say anything, gives me a prompt. cant ping google.com
2007-03-23T13:56:00.000Z	soundray	wire93	have you tried to 'tail -f /var/log/syslog &' while you bring it up?
2007-03-23T13:57:00.000Z	soundray	wire93	it sounds like it's still looking for a DHCP address
2007-03-23T13:57:00.000Z	soundray	wire93	the tail would clear that up
2007-03-23T13:58:00.000Z	soundray	wire93	actually, ifup would echo the DHCP requests on stderr as well, so it can't be that.
2007-03-23T13:58:00.000Z	wire93	soundray	'network is down', etc.
2007-03-23T14:00:00.000Z	soundray	wire93	scan dmesg for messages relating to eth1. Maybe the driver reports a problem.
2007-03-23T14:02:00.000Z	wire93	soundray	what must i do in order to have those changes i made stay permanent
2007-03-23T14:02:00.000Z	soundray	wire93	save the interfaces file, that should be all
2007-03-23T14:03:00.000Z	wire93	soundray	alright. thanks for you help mate!
2007-03-23T14:04:00.000Z	soundray	wire93	paste your /etc/network/interfaces on paste.ubuntu-nl.org if you want us to have a look
2007-03-23T14:05:00.000Z	soundray	wire93	no clues from dmesg?
