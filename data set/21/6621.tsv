2009-03-24T06:26:00.000Z	crdlb	Eggbertx1	what video card?
2009-03-24T06:28:00.000Z	crdlb	Eggbertx1	with ATI's fglrx driver, OpenGL will not work well unless you disable compiz
2009-03-24T06:29:00.000Z	crdlb	Eggbertx1	no
2009-03-24T06:29:00.000Z	crdlb	Eggbertx1	system > prefs > appearance > visual effects > none
2009-03-24T06:30:00.000Z	crdlb	Eggbertx1	the only driver that can do it curently is nvidia's driver, though support is coming in others
2009-03-24T06:34:00.000Z	crdlb	Eggbertx1	no, the nvidia driver is for nvidia cards ...
2009-03-24T06:39:00.000Z	crdlb	Eggbertx1	you don't, then nvidia driver is for nvidia video cards
2009-03-24T06:40:00.000Z	crdlb	Eggbertx1	of course not; it's a driver for operating the hardware
2009-03-24T06:40:00.000Z	crdlb	Eggbertx1	there isn't one that's faster
2009-03-24T06:41:00.000Z	crdlb	Eggbertx1	the open source radeon driver supports your card, but it's no better at OpenGL with compiz
2009-03-24T06:41:00.000Z	crdlb	Eggbertx1	just turn off compiz
2009-03-24T06:41:00.000Z	crdlb	Eggbertx1	then it shouldn't flicker
