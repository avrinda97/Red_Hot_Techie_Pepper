2007-02-07T11:24:00.000Z	kerpal		anyone know how to trouble shoot a problem mounting an sata drive in gparted? i keep getting a input/output error
2007-02-07T11:26:00.000Z	someone3	kerpal	I/O error usualy means dead hardware
2007-02-07T11:26:00.000Z	kerpal		the hardware is most certainly not dead, though
2007-02-07T11:26:00.000Z	someone3		oh, it works on other OSs/machines
2007-02-07T11:26:00.000Z	kerpal		it's my SATA drive, right
2007-02-07T11:27:00.000Z	someone3		drivers probably
2007-02-07T11:27:00.000Z	kerpal		so if its a drivers conflict do i look for drivers for my SATA controller?
2007-02-07T11:27:00.000Z	someone3		i would think so
2007-02-07T11:28:00.000Z	someone3		the disk is internal??
2007-02-07T11:28:00.000Z	kerpal		right, it's an SATA 300 gb seagate drive
2007-02-07T11:28:00.000Z	kerpal		the controller is built into the motherboard
2007-02-07T11:29:00.000Z	kerpal		oh really?
2007-02-07T11:29:00.000Z	kerpal		so i'm screwed if i try to use this drive?
2007-02-07T11:29:00.000Z	someone3		ya i figured as much
2007-02-07T11:29:00.000Z	kerpal		lol, then what's up
2007-02-07T11:29:00.000Z	someone3		ya? wot?
2007-02-07T11:30:00.000Z	someone3		LOL, nice
2007-02-07T11:30:00.000Z	kerpal	myconid	did you just say that cause you have had bad luck with seagates or just to confuse me ;<
2007-02-07T11:31:00.000Z	kerpal		damn!
2007-02-07T11:31:00.000Z	kerpal		arggh i want to install ubuntu :( :(
