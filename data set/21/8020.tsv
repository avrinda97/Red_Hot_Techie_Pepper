2006-06-14T07:52:00.000Z	kane77		is there a way to repeat some command? until it's successfull??
2006-06-14T07:53:00.000Z	SeanTater	kane77	yes, what command?
2006-06-14T07:54:00.000Z	kane77	SeanTater	well I'm trying to connect using telnet, but there are too many connections...
2006-06-14T07:54:00.000Z	SeanTater	kane77	how often do you want it to see if it;s successful?
2006-06-14T07:54:00.000Z	kane77	SeanTater	well lets say every minute or so... or maybe 5 minutes...
2006-06-14T07:55:00.000Z	SeanTater	kane77	okay, try this: until WhateverCommandYouWantItToDo; do sleep 5m; done
2006-06-14T07:57:00.000Z	SeanTater	kane77	does it work?
2006-06-14T07:57:00.000Z	kane77	SeanTater	with the done?
2006-06-14T07:57:00.000Z	SeanTater	kane77	yes
2006-06-14T07:58:00.000Z	SeanTater	kane77	does it work?
2006-06-14T07:58:00.000Z	kane77	SeanTater	how do I know if it works?
2006-06-14T07:59:00.000Z	SeanTater	kane77	if you don't see the user@user-desktop stuff within one second of trying it -- by telling me you're not sure, I'm sure it worked
2006-06-14T07:59:00.000Z	SeanTater	kane77	hum --
2006-06-14T08:00:00.000Z	SeanTater	kane77	it should wait about 5 minutes and try again, not give you a line waiting for a sommand
2006-06-14T08:00:00.000Z	kane77	SeanTater	but it does give me a command line...
2006-06-14T08:01:00.000Z	SeanTater	kane77	can you paste back in here the exact command you tried?
2006-06-14T08:01:00.000Z	kane77	SeanTater	 until nc ascii-wm.net 2006 ; do sleep 1m; done
2006-06-14T08:01:00.000Z	kane77	SeanTater	or  until telnet ascii-wm.net 2006 ; do sleep 1m; done
2006-06-14T08:02:00.000Z	SeanTater	kane77	I'm a frayed knot
2006-06-14T08:02:00.000Z	SeanTater	kane77	I think the telnet returns normal whether it connects or not
2006-06-14T08:03:00.000Z	SeanTater	kane77	I think you are stuck with doing it yourself
