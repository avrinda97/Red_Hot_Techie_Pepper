2007-08-23T06:51:00.000Z	john_		i'm still trying to install WASTE (http://waste.sf.net/), but i can't seem to do it
2007-08-23T06:51:00.000Z	john_		the package comes with the source code, but when i unzip it and try doing things like "make" it doesn't work
2007-08-23T06:53:00.000Z	john_		i guess what i'm asking is: how do i compile the source?
2007-08-23T06:54:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	john_	make
2007-08-23T06:54:00.000Z	john_	Megaqwerty	'make install' doesn't work :( i'm still new...
2007-08-23T06:55:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	john_	can you describe what you're trying to do?

2007-08-23T06:59:00.000Z	john_	Megaqwerty	i assume i first have to cd my way to the unzipped dir?
