2010-07-24T12:17:00.000Z	D3bian		Hahaha ubuntuuuuuu , good one
2010-07-24T12:17:00.000Z	D3bian		But uhm, back to my little problem
2010-07-24T12:17:00.000Z	D3bian		Got a question regarding network file transfer.  I'm trying to copy .nef files over SAMBA network, but I get that I do not have enough rights.  However I can copy any other file.  Any ideas?  Google is not my friend this time :(
2010-07-24T12:18:00.000Z	D3bian		anyone got an idea why I can't copy that over my network?
2010-07-24T12:19:00.000Z	D3bian		gimme sec
2010-07-24T12:19:00.000Z	D3bian		Permission denied
2010-07-24T12:19:00.000Z	D3bian		Thats all
2010-07-24T12:20:00.000Z	D3bian		Dunno which logs to go check yet it's first time I played with Samba
2010-07-24T12:20:00.000Z	D3bian		lol
2010-07-24T12:20:00.000Z	greezmunkey	D3bian	are you using Nautilus to move files? If so try gksudo nautilus & in a terminal, and try again.
2010-07-24T12:23:00.000Z	greezmunkey	D3bian	Realize that the files will be owned by root if you do, so you may have to change that once you get them to your system.
2010-07-24T12:33:00.000Z	D3bian	greezmunkey	still not working man
2010-07-24T12:34:00.000Z	greezmunkey	D3bian	yeah, there is obviously more to this...try this: make a copy of one of the nef files. change the extension to .txt, and then try moving that copy via ubuntu.
2010-07-24T12:38:00.000Z	D3bian	greezmunkey	works immediately
2010-07-24T12:38:00.000Z	greezmunkey	D3bian	My guess then is that your system doesn't like that binary file. Probably sees it as a potential threat. Why is another question.
2010-07-24T12:42:00.000Z	greezmunkey	D3bian	it's actually an issue with your Samba setup, a permissions thing. It can be fixed, but you'll have a bit of reading to do to get there.
2010-07-24T12:43:00.000Z	D3bian	greezmunkey	I had a feeling it was :(
2010-07-24T12:44:00.000Z	greezmunkey	D3bian	How can reading about Ubuntu possibly be boring? :)
2010-07-24T12:45:00.000Z	D3bian	greezmunkey	not boring, I'm lazy today
2010-07-24T12:49:00.000Z	greezmunkey	D3bian	I was going to respond, but was being lazy...that and my computer just sits there when I tell it to do something...what's up with that?
