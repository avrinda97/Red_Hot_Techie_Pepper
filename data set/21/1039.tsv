2011-02-27T05:59:00.000Z	Jonii		Ubuntu plays sound on _both_ stereos and headset
2011-02-27T06:00:00.000Z	Jonii		At the same time
2011-02-27T06:01:00.000Z	Jonii		Is it a bug or a feature that you can't drag volume control bar on the upper right corner of default ubuntu installation?
2011-02-27T06:01:00.000Z	Jonii		If you try dragging it, volume goes quickly to the max
2011-02-27T06:02:00.000Z	Jonii		Hey, wtf
2011-02-27T06:02:00.000Z	Jonii		Why I can't change the volume for other device when two devices are playing the music?
2011-02-27T06:03:00.000Z	Jonii		What's going on? :/
2011-02-27T06:05:00.000Z	Jonii		Hey, what's going on. Why does ubuntu play sound from two devices? How can I stop this from happening?
2011-02-27T06:05:00.000Z	Jonii		Or change the volumes of these devices?
2011-02-27T06:07:00.000Z	Jonii		I have speakers and headphones. I connect headphones, when speakers play music, and now both speakers _and_ headphones are playing music, and there doesn't seem to be any way to stop speakers from doing that. Also, is it a bug or a feature that you can't drag volume control thingie on the upper left corner?
2011-02-27T06:08:00.000Z	Lumenary	Jonii	 Open Synaptic and install "pavucontrol" (if it is available) and see if that helps
2011-02-27T06:08:00.000Z	Jonii		What's pavucontrol?
2011-02-27T06:08:00.000Z	Lumenary		Then check your Application Menu for "PulseAudio Volume Control"
2011-02-27T06:09:00.000Z	Lumenary		(You may need to logout/login again for the Application Menu to pick up the change)
2011-02-27T06:09:00.000Z	Lumenary		Ubuntu uses PulseAudio to control access to audio devices.
2011-02-27T06:10:00.000Z	Lumenary		Multiple sources (programs playing music, or microphone inputs) can be routed to multiple sinks (outputs like speakers and headphones)
2011-02-27T06:10:00.000Z	Lumenary		The PulseAudio Volume Control may help you to manage your audio devices
2011-02-27T06:11:00.000Z	Lumenary		As for the "volume control" bug, I need more information
2011-02-27T06:11:00.000Z	Lumenary		What version are you running?>
2011-02-27T06:11:00.000Z	Lumenary		?
2011-02-27T06:13:00.000Z	Jonii	Lumenary	10.4
