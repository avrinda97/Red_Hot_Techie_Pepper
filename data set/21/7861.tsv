2006-08-22T06:37:00.000Z	profoX`		(yea, even in GNOME)
2006-08-22T06:37:00.000Z	profoX`		k3b runs in GNOME doesn't it
2006-08-22T06:38:00.000Z	profoX`		k3b is for KDE initially, but if you don't mind some extra kde libs, it will run fine in GNOME
2006-08-22T06:40:00.000Z	profoX`		fluxbox is just a wm.. can't really compare that to kde or gnome
2006-08-22T06:40:00.000Z	profoX`		i use fluxbox for my games though
2006-08-22T06:40:00.000Z	profoX`		it saves on RAM :)
2006-08-22T06:40:00.000Z	kaot	profoX`	I've got a perl script the fires up a naked X server for playing games.
2006-08-22T06:41:00.000Z	profoX`	kaot	yea well, I got a bash script for that :P
2006-08-22T06:41:00.000Z	profoX`	kaot	not that hard, right? something like X -ac :1 & DISPLAY=:1 fluxbox
2006-08-22T06:42:00.000Z	kaot	profoX`	well, it's also got a little menu when you fire it up, where you can pick which game you're gonna play and whatnot
2006-08-22T06:42:00.000Z	profoX`	kaot	reason I run a wm (fluxbox) there because I like to play some games windowed, or I want to load a terminal/browser in background
2006-08-22T06:42:00.000Z	profoX`	kaot	oh, like Xgame ?
2006-08-22T06:43:00.000Z	profoX`	kaot	oh lol ;)
2006-08-22T06:43:00.000Z	profoX`	kaot	I never tried it.. I like to do it my own way :P
2006-08-22T13:19:00.000Z	kaot	profoX`	the system manager in gnome has a way you can check that, hang on I'll mess with it a second
2006-08-22T13:20:00.000Z	kaot	profoX`	but you probably want something you can build into another program or script or something, I'm guessing.
2006-08-22T13:20:00.000Z	kaot	profoX`	anyway, if you're interested you can just open system monitor, right click on program name, memory maps.  if your skilled maybe you can dig at the system monitor sources to find the code to do it
2006-08-22T13:21:00.000Z	profoX`	kaot	yea, but I'll do that part myself. I want to gather as much about the memory of a process as possible, because my prog will have to extract that stuff. I'll check the sysmonitor
2006-08-22T13:22:00.000Z	kaot	profoX`	oh hey, how about /proc/$pid/maps
2006-08-22T13:22:00.000Z	kaot	profoX`	that seems to show memory address ranges
2006-08-22T13:23:00.000Z	profoX`	kaot	yea I was alraedy looking in /proc/pid/ but its a bit chaossy there :) I'll check the map file
