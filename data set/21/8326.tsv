2006-11-23T13:27:00.000Z	dabaR	theplatypus	sure
2006-11-23T13:27:00.000Z	dabaR	theplatypus	run sudo fdisk -l and post output to paste.ubuntu-nl.org, then give us a link.
2006-11-23T13:30:00.000Z	dabaR	theplatypus	what is the file system type?
2006-11-23T13:31:00.000Z	theplatypus	dabaR	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33513/
2006-11-23T13:32:00.000Z	dabaR	theplatypus	then you just need to enter something like /dev/hdc1       /media/hdc1            ext3    defaults              0       0" given /media/hdc1 is where you want to mount, and that you do not want users other than root to have write access to it.
2006-11-23T13:32:00.000Z	dabaR	theplatypus	show your /etc/fstab on a pastebin too after you make an attempt at entering that line.
2006-11-23T13:35:00.000Z	dabaR	theplatypus	then you change defaults to defaults,rw
2006-11-23T13:37:00.000Z	theplatypus	dabaR	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33515/
2006-11-23T13:39:00.000Z	dabaR	theplatypus	thanks. http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33516/ is more like it, I think. try that, save the file, then run sudo mount -a and post the output of ls -ld /media/hdc1. Make sure you do really have the /media/hdc1 directory
2006-11-23T13:42:00.000Z	theplatypus	dabaR	 sudo mount -a
2006-11-23T13:43:00.000Z	dabaR	theplatypus	sudo mkdir /media/hdc1
2006-11-23T13:45:00.000Z	dabaR	theplatypus	try one thing, sudo umount /dev/hdc1, then edit the file again, change defaults,rw to just rw, then save, close, and run those two commands again, please.
2006-11-23T13:49:00.000Z	dabaR	theplatypus	I am not sure what to do to get write privileges at mount. Your drive will likely be mounted with only read and browse privileges at boot. You can change that with the sudo chmod -r 777 /media/hdc1 command likely. Try this, run sudo chmod -r 777 /media/hdc1, then sudo umount /media/hdc1, then sudo mount -a, then ls -ld /media/hdc1 and see whether drwxrwxrwx shows up as the permissions
2006-11-23T13:52:00.000Z	dabaR	theplatypus	show me the exact command you run, please
2006-11-23T13:55:00.000Z	theplatypus	dabaR	I can cd into if that is any help
2006-11-23T14:00:00.000Z	dabaR	theplatypus	ya, I am not sure, it is very inconsistent I am finding, here it allows for write with the same setup as yours. Yesterday another user was here, we had to chmod the drive to get the permissions, now it does not allow chmod for you...
2006-11-23T14:01:00.000Z	theplatypus	dabaR	I can work with this for now. I just want to store some files in order to do a clean install without losing those files
2006-11-23T14:03:00.000Z	dabaR	theplatypus	try defaults,users,rw in fstab instead of rw, when you feel like trying something else,.
