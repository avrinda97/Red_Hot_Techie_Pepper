2005-06-03T08:26:00.000Z	Varanger		I am using Ubuntu Hoary and I can't make my i915 card work
2005-06-03T08:26:00.000Z	bob2	Varanger	there's an open bug about that
2005-06-03T08:30:00.000Z	Varanger	bob2	where can I look for that bug?
2005-06-25T07:30:00.000Z	bob2	Varanger	2.6.11 in hoary is known to not work
2005-06-25T07:30:00.000Z	Varanger	bob2	thanks for the answer!
2005-06-25T07:30:00.000Z	bob2	Varanger	just use 2.6.10
2005-07-27T10:36:00.000Z	bob2	Varanger	work around broken acpi hardware, I gather
2005-07-27T10:37:00.000Z	Varanger	bob2	for example...
2005-07-27T10:37:00.000Z	bob2	Varanger	for example what?
2005-07-27T10:37:00.000Z	Varanger	bob2	what do you mean by brokem acpi ?
2005-07-27T10:38:00.000Z	bob2	Varanger	do you know what ACPI is?
2005-07-27T10:39:00.000Z	Varanger	bob2	yes, it's something for power managemente
2005-07-27T10:39:00.000Z	Varanger	bob2	that's why I don't understand why a broken power managemente can corrupt pci
2005-07-27T10:40:00.000Z	bob2	Varanger	it does other things, too, like arrange irq lines
2005-10-04T09:41:00.000Z	bob2	Varanger	why?
2005-10-04T09:41:00.000Z	Varanger	bob2	actually, I'd like to install grub on sdaX and leave the boot sector with NT loader
2005-10-04T09:42:00.000Z	bob2	Varanger	then use windows to reinstall the bootloader in the mbr
2005-10-04T09:43:00.000Z	Varanger	bob2	then I used a rescue cd on Linux to install grub on sdaX ?
2005-10-04T09:44:00.000Z	bob2	Varanger	yes
