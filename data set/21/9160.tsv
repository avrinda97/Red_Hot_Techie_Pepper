2005-11-15T17:54:00.000Z	LjL	chicken	anyway, meanwhile, let me just get ubotu to inform you about installing java
2005-11-15T17:55:00.000Z	chicken	LjL	y can't i click on the link
2005-11-15T17:56:00.000Z	LjL	chicken	no idea, i'm not using Gnome... but you can copy and paste, i suppose
2005-11-15T17:56:00.000Z	LjL	chicken	KDE
2005-11-15T17:56:00.000Z	chicken	LjL	can i use KDE if so how
2005-11-15T17:57:00.000Z	LjL	chicken	by installing the "kubuntu-desktop" package, but you should probably look around on the web a bit to decide whether you think you prefer Gnome or KDE
2005-11-15T17:57:00.000Z	chicken	LjL	what are the diferences between them
2005-11-15T17:58:00.000Z	LjL	chicken	well, there are a ton of differences, they're different desktop environments... but mainly, KDE has many more configuration options and is much more versatile, while Gnome tries to focus on simplicity and usability --- though YMMV
2005-11-15T17:59:00.000Z	LjL	chicken	like you download and install anything else in ubuntu: by typing "aptitude install kubuntu-desktop" in a terminal
2005-11-15T17:59:00.000Z	LjL	chicken	(or by using Synaptic, or Adept, or whatever you prefer)
2005-11-15T06:00:00.000Z	chicken	LjL	can i use synaptric to install limewire
2005-11-15T06:01:00.000Z	LjL	chicken	no, you can't. that's not packaged, apparently, otherwise people would have simply told you to "aptitude install limewire" ;-)
2005-11-15T06:02:00.000Z	chicken	LjL	i just installed java will it work with mozilla now
2005-11-15T06:03:00.000Z	LjL	chicken	dunno, hope so, i don't have java installed
2005-11-15T06:03:00.000Z	chicken	LjL	o ok lol guess ill try it
2005-11-15T06:04:00.000Z	chicken	LjL	i just typed aptitude install kubuntu how do i get kde to work on it now
2005-11-15T06:05:00.000Z	LjL	chicken	it was "aptitude install kubuntu-desktop", not just kubuntu... anyway, after installing it, just log out and, before logging it again, click on the "Session" button and chose KDE
2005-11-15T06:05:00.000Z	chicken	LjL	o so i should have typed aptitude install kubuntu-desktop
2005-11-15T06:06:00.000Z	chicken	LjL	ok ill brb to try and get this thingy to wo rk
