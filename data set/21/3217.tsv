2009-02-28T12:00:00.000Z	anilalur		I tried changing resolve.conf but it doesnt seem to work
2009-02-28T12:01:00.000Z	usser	anilalur	adjust /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf
2009-02-28T12:04:00.000Z	anilalur	usser	I added opendns in prepend n removed domain-name-server from request
2009-02-28T12:04:00.000Z	usser	anilalur	you have to reconnect or rerun dhclient
2009-02-28T12:07:00.000Z	usser	anilalur	whats in /etc/resolv.conf your opendns server?
2009-02-28T12:08:00.000Z	anilalur	usser	prepend domain-name-servers 208.67.222.222,208.67.220.220;
