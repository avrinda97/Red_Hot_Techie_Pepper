2008-04-29T03:28:00.000Z	norbert_		hi, I would very much like to help out with testing the 'beta' Ubuntu versions; I know these are announced on the dev-mailing list, but I don't want all the messages from that list; is there a way to receive an e-mail including an e-mail address where I can report suggestions after testing it?
2008-04-29T03:29:00.000Z	jrib	norbert_	ubuntu repeats its development cycle every 6 months.  You can then send feedback using launchpad.net
2008-04-29T03:30:00.000Z	norbert_	jrib	is there an easier way, can someone provide an easier way for me; I want to help
2008-04-29T03:30:00.000Z	jrib	norbert_	I don't understand what exactly you want
2008-04-29T03:32:00.000Z	norbert_	jrib	I would like to receive an e-mail, instead of trying to remember when the moment is there to send feedback
2008-04-29T03:34:00.000Z	norbert_	jrib	I know I can always send feedback or report bugs, but I prefer to give feedback briefly before the new version gets announced
2008-04-29T03:34:00.000Z	jrib	norbert_	ok, so the new version is due in october.  Send feedback in september-october.  I'm still not sure what you want
2008-04-29T03:35:00.000Z	norbert_	jrib	that means I have to remember to do that in september-october
2008-04-29T03:35:00.000Z	jrib	norbert_	well, you could subscribe to the annoncement mailing list
2008-04-29T03:36:00.000Z	norbert_	jrib	how many e-mails will I receive each month?
2008-04-29T03:38:00.000Z	jrib	norbert_	not sure, check the archives
2008-04-29T03:39:00.000Z	jrib	norbert_	lists.ubuntu.com
2008-04-29T03:42:00.000Z	jrib	norbert_	I have 50 mails since April 06.  It seems to be exactly what you want
2008-04-29T03:42:00.000Z	norbert_	jrib	ok, I'll subscribe to it then
2008-09-18T17:52:00.000Z	jrib	norbert_	system -> administration -> software sources
2008-09-20T23:16:00.000Z	jrib	norbert_	tell him to use 'sudo -i'
2008-09-20T23:16:00.000Z	norbert_	jrib	yeah, I could do that
2008-09-20T23:17:00.000Z	jrib	norbert_	you shouldn't really need one though
2008-09-20T23:17:00.000Z	norbert_	jrib	well, I'm writing a manual how he can start an icecast
2008-09-20T23:17:00.000Z	norbert_	jrib	and that really requires some editing to files that has root permissions
2008-09-20T23:17:00.000Z	norbert_	jrib	which means I have to tell him to sudo -i and then run gedit
