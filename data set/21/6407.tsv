2007-04-13T06:08:00.000Z	JacktheHomeless		Hey guys, I have a major problem. For some reason, my desktop is giving me some weird fisheye effect. For instance, the icons near the outside of the screen are smaller than the ones in the center.
2007-04-13T06:09:00.000Z	JacktheHomeless		woah... it didnt put in all of my question
2007-04-13T06:09:00.000Z	cafuego	JacktheHomeless	CRT screen?
2007-04-13T06:09:00.000Z	JacktheHomeless	cafuego	yes, CRT
2007-04-13T06:10:00.000Z	cafuego	JacktheHomeless	Time to twiddle its settings, I think.
2007-04-13T06:10:00.000Z	JacktheHomeless	cafuego	well its only doing it in ubuntu, in windows its not like that.
2007-04-13T06:11:00.000Z	cafuego	JacktheHomeless	Probably the videod river doing some sort of compensation. I certainly know of no X extesnion that renders the desktop as seen through a fisheye. (Not one that is installed (by default) as aprt of Ubuntu anyway)
2007-04-13T06:12:00.000Z	JacktheHomeless	cafuego	Hmm, my vid card drivers were installed via envy. I already tried uninstalling and reinstalling them.
2007-04-13T06:13:00.000Z	cafuego	JacktheHomeless	I meant the wiondows ones are compensating. Under Linux, you should twiddle the CRT buttons to make it display properly.
2007-04-13T06:13:00.000Z	JacktheHomeless	cafuego	Ohhhh ok, ill give it a shot, give me a second
2007-04-13T06:15:00.000Z	JacktheHomeless	cafuego	nothing im doing in the CRT settings is giving me any option to unskew the screen. All im getting are pan left right up and down, and stretch left right up and down
2007-04-13T06:17:00.000Z	JacktheHomeless	cafuego	Give me a sec, im gonna pull out an old CRT monitor and see if it does it on that one
2007-04-13T06:17:00.000Z	cafuego	JacktheHomeless	most crt's also have concavity and various other rotate/blend/whatever settings
2007-04-13T06:25:00.000Z	JacktheHomeless	cafuego	damn, that other monitor doesnt work. But one thing i noticed, is that ubuntu isnt allowing me to change resolutions either. The screen just blacks out then returns to where it was.
2007-04-13T06:26:00.000Z	cafuego	JacktheHomeless	Hmm. Dos it support all resolutions you're switching between?
2007-04-13T06:26:00.000Z	JacktheHomeless	cafuego	yup, i was trying to switch from 1024x768 to 800x600 just to see if it fixed the skewing.
2007-04-13T06:28:00.000Z	cafuego	JacktheHomeless	... at the specified refresh rate?
2007-04-13T06:28:00.000Z	cafuego	JacktheHomeless	You may need to twiddle the hsync/vsync rates in the cfg file
2007-04-13T06:29:00.000Z	JacktheHomeless	cafuego	at the standard refresh rate selected. However, i did just get it to change and now it is even more messed up. The skewing isnt as bad, but theres a big bar like thing running through the top menu bar
2007-04-13T06:30:00.000Z	JacktheHomeless	cafuego	you have to understand, im an ubuntu noob. Is there any other simpler way to try to fix it?
2007-04-13T06:31:00.000Z	JacktheHomeless	cafuego	OK i just tried to take a screenshot to hopefully show you whats going on, and all it did was make a little grey box with a red X in the middle
