2010-01-24T06:48:00.000Z	Gran_Ger		Hi there! Using Karmic as Live CD, the monitor starts blinking at the login, but not into graphics mode, but in text mode
2010-01-24T06:48:00.000Z	Gran_Ger		I have the same issue at two computers
2010-01-24T06:48:00.000Z	bankix	Gran_Ger	Which graphics cards?
2010-01-24T06:49:00.000Z	bankix	Gran_Ger	Hm, GeForce 6500 should work for all I know.
2010-01-24T06:50:00.000Z	bankix	Gran_Ger	 Is it the same monitor for both computers?
2010-01-24T06:50:00.000Z	bankix	Gran_Ger	I hoped for an easy solution :-)
2010-01-24T06:52:00.000Z	bankix	Gran_Ger	Have a look at /var/log/Xorg.0.log at the command line. The last lines should tell you what's going wrong with the graphic mode.
2010-01-24T06:52:00.000Z	bankix	Gran_Ger	Oh, you do see the splash animation during the boot?
2010-01-24T06:54:00.000Z	bankix	Gran_Ger	Ah, if you use the live system, everything is fine, but if you boot your installed system, the graphics mode won't come up?
2010-01-24T06:56:00.000Z	bankix	Gran_Ger	OK. And you did install the proprietary Nvidia driver, right?
2010-01-24T06:57:00.000Z	bankix	Gran_Ger	Let me guess, there was a kernel update before your problems?
2010-01-24T06:57:00.000Z	bankix	Gran_Ger	OK, check with "lsmod" if the nvidia module is loaded.
2010-01-24T06:58:00.000Z	bankix	Gran_Ger	If not, try to load it manually.
2010-01-24T06:58:00.000Z	bankix	Gran_Ger	Via "modprobe nvidia".
2010-01-24T06:59:00.000Z	Gran_Ger	bankix	with that computer, the only problem I have, and never did before It's the freeze
2010-01-24T07:00:00.000Z	bankix	Gran_Ger	Hm? When does the computer freeze? I think it's blinking some times?
2010-01-24T07:02:00.000Z	bankix	Gran_Ger	Sorry, I'm puzzeled now. What is your problem?
2010-01-24T07:03:00.000Z	bankix	Gran_Ger	When exactly does the computer freeze? Is it reproducable?
2010-01-24T07:03:00.000Z	Gran_Ger	bankix	let me see.
2010-01-24T07:18:00.000Z	bankix	Gran_Ger	Still there?
2010-01-24T07:19:00.000Z	bankix	Gran_Ger	Did you remember the last freeze, when it happended? Could you describe the circumstances a bit?
