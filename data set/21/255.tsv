2012-06-10T06:07:00.000Z	Relondo		What's that, John? "Ban me, please!"
2012-06-10T06:07:00.000Z	Relondo		*?
2012-06-10T06:08:00.000Z	Relondo		Is there any way to "convert" a Wubi installation to a standard one?
2012-06-10T06:08:00.000Z	jagginess	Relondo	it's more troutble than its worth.. the time spent doing that is the time you could of done a fresh install
2012-06-10T06:09:00.000Z	jagginess	Relondo	you hve data on there you need to backup?
2012-06-10T06:09:00.000Z	jagginess	Relondo	so delete the loopback file or undelete wubi.. and backup your windows user data.. then try to install ubuntu
2012-06-10T06:09:00.000Z	Relondo	jagginess	Wait, what?
2012-06-10T06:10:00.000Z	jagginess	Relondo	see if you can free space on ntfs-- if you uninstall wubi.. see that uninstaller deletes the 4+ gig file it made.. it'll be somewhere in a subfolder in c:\
2012-06-10T06:11:00.000Z	jagginess	Relondo	this 4+ gig file that was made by wubi is a loopbackfile (you dont need to know-- but you should know that it's in 1 file)
2012-06-15T01:05:00.000Z	jagginess	Relondo	.tar.gz -- you can extract it visually with ark or another gui archive tool
2012-06-15T01:05:00.000Z	jagginess	Relondo	btw.. its extracting (not unzipping-- unzipping is for .zip files)
2012-06-15T01:07:00.000Z	jagginess	Relondo	should be in the menu
2012-06-15T01:07:00.000Z	jagginess	Relondo	accessories/archive manager
2012-06-15T01:08:00.000Z	Relondo	jagginess	Oh, right click + extract. Silly me. Also, how do I give myself permanent root access? It's annoying  to have to terminal + sudo everything.
2012-06-15T01:08:00.000Z	jagginess	Relondo	be careful
2012-06-15T01:08:00.000Z	Relondo	jagginess	Why? Is it any different from being a permanent administrator on windows?
2012-06-15T01:20:00.000Z	jagginess	Relondo	package default-jre
2012-06-15T01:20:00.000Z	Relondo	jagginess	God that's much easier.
2012-06-15T01:21:00.000Z	Relondo	jagginess	...how do I install packages?
2012-06-15T01:22:00.000Z	jagginess	Relondo	try the ubuntu software center
2012-06-15T01:22:00.000Z	jagginess	Relondo	others use synaptic, and others like me use command-line tools
