2004-12-14T09:41:00.000Z	illsorted		Does anyone know how I can run the Synaptic Package Manager in XCFE4? I tried running "sudo synaptic" from the console, and also added a launcher to my panel. neither works.

2004-12-14T09:42:00.000Z	illsorted	bytecoder	i get GTK errors when running from the console, and nothing when clicking the launcher

2004-12-14T09:45:00.000Z	illsorted	bytecoder	pasted
2004-12-14T09:46:00.000Z	bytecoder	illsorted	ok, can you run synaptic in gnome?
2004-12-14T09:46:00.000Z	illsorted	bytecoder	yes, runs fine in gnome
2004-12-14T09:46:00.000Z	bytecoder	illsorted	odd
2004-12-14T09:48:00.000Z	bytecoder	illsorted	hmm
2004-12-14T09:48:00.000Z	bytecoder	illsorted	try running X without any desktop environment/window managers and see if it still doesn't work
2004-12-14T09:49:00.000Z	bytecoder	illsorted	to see if it's a problem with xfce or with gtk
2004-12-14T09:49:00.000Z	illsorted	bytecoder	how do I go about that?
2004-12-14T09:49:00.000Z	bytecoder	illsorted	you have to modify .xinitrc in your home directory and 'startx' manually
2004-12-14T09:50:00.000Z	bytecoder	illsorted	first, you have to shut down gdm
2004-12-14T09:51:00.000Z	bytecoder	illsorted	you should probably post your problem over at ubuntuforums.com
2004-12-14T09:51:00.000Z	bytecoder	illsorted	I have to go now, hope you get your problem fixed
2004-12-14T09:51:00.000Z	illsorted	bytecoder	will do, thanks
