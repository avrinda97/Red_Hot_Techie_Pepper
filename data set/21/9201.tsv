2005-10-23T11:08:00.000Z	carthik	Ciphrix	you shouldnt need to use the web interface to cups, but if you should search on google, and you will find out pretty easily

2005-10-23T11:11:00.000Z	carthik	Ciphrix	try the debian package, it is only a printer driver - further - http://linuxprinting.org/printer_list.cgi should help you find the right driver, should you need to find it
2005-10-23T11:11:00.000Z	Ciphrix	carthik	ok ic
2005-10-23T11:13:00.000Z	Ciphrix	carthik	the printermodel i have doesnt exist in that list
2005-10-23T11:13:00.000Z	carthik	Ciphrix	maybe you got the model number a little mixed up...
2005-10-23T11:13:00.000Z	carthik	Ciphrix	try the debian driver, whats to lose?
2005-10-23T11:14:00.000Z	Ciphrix	carthik	no i didnt
2005-10-23T11:14:00.000Z	carthik	Ciphrix	DO it
2005-10-23T11:14:00.000Z	Ciphrix	carthik	ok ill try find the brothers support site again
2005-10-23T11:15:00.000Z	carthik	Ciphrix	dude, install the .deb that you found for debian and try to set up printing with that - if it works, that solves your problem. If that does not work, go searching on google again... but try what you have your hands on now first
2005-10-23T11:16:00.000Z	Ciphrix	carthik	i know that stuff sure , i downloaded tyhe rehat rpm , and tried it didnt work , but ofcourse ill try the deb package
2005-10-23T11:17:00.000Z	carthik	Ciphrix	for the record, a standard default generic postscript drive will work if your printer is a postscript enabled printer
2005-10-23T11:19:00.000Z	Ciphrix	carthik	k
2005-10-23T11:24:00.000Z	carthik	Ciphrix	sudo dpkg -i <package-name>.deb
2005-10-23T11:25:00.000Z	carthik	Ciphrix	after you do that the printer driver file will be at some location, to find that out do a dpkg -L <package-name> (which will give you names and location of all file installed for that package)
