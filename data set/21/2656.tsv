2009-08-04T16:28:00.000Z	DrManhattan		can anyone recommend a quick way to replace-in-files without having to install anything?
2009-08-04T16:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DrManhattan	 'replace text 'strings' in specific text files' you mean?
2009-08-04T16:30:00.000Z	DrManhattan	Dr_Willis	yes
2009-08-04T16:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DrManhattan	 sed can do that.. I also recall ages ago a script/program called 'gres' that was more flexiable.. but i doubt if its the default.
2009-08-04T16:31:00.000Z	DrManhattan	Dr_Willis	thanks, i have sed, will look over man pages
2009-08-04T16:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DrManhattan	 theres tons of sed and awk example pages out also.. awk  may be better in some cases
2009-08-04T16:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DrManhattan	 i found the 'gres' script. :) its from the book on using sed and awk -> the script is at --> http://books.google.com/books?id=m4ZzElQZxcoC&pg=PA51&lpg=PA51&dq=gres+awk+script&source=bl&ots=ZPRfqUlapR&sig=9mptI8t24cbZwOLFT4kKXkdfFHo&hl=en&ei=Oh14SoC6Aov8tgf2wdCWCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1#v=onepage&q=gres%20awk%20script&f=false
2010-01-03T08:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DrManhattan	 i just installed it from the google repos...
2010-01-03T08:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DrManhattan	 dident compile anything,
2010-01-03T08:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DrManhattan	 google repos has chromuimn browser for 64bit.. Im using it now
2010-01-03T08:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DrManhattan	 the 2 are not the same. :)
2010-07-11T15:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DrManhattan	 i think server kernel has 'pae' for more ram. on 32bit systems.
2010-07-11T15:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DrManhattan	 i always use 64bit when  my cpu supports it - reguardless of my actual ram
2010-07-11T15:43:00.000Z	DrManhattan	Dr_Willis	why?
2010-07-11T15:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DrManhattan	 5-10% speed gain when doing CPU intensive tasks for one reason
2010-07-11T15:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DrManhattan	 easier to have all the box's on the lan do 64bit when using apt-cacher-ng also
2010-11-14T17:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DrManhattan	 for some tasks 64bit will be faster.
2010-11-14T17:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DrManhattan	 i always use 64bit if the hardware supportes it.
2010-11-14T17:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DrManhattan	 has worked fine for me for 2+ yrs.
2011-05-30T14:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DrManhattan	 hit space when you see the man/logo and then theres some F keys on the next screen
2011-05-30T14:36:00.000Z	DrManhattan	Dr_Willis	thank you
