2010-02-03T05:08:00.000Z	ardchoille		How would I start a second xorg instance and log in as the same user but in a different window manager?
2010-02-03T05:08:00.000Z	ardchoille		Is that even possible?
2010-02-03T05:09:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ardchoille	that use to be possible - but you need two different users now with GDM
2010-02-03T05:10:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ardchoille	if you try with the same user it is going to fail...
2010-02-03T05:16:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ardchoille	since 9.10 i don't think it will allow the same user to log in
2010-02-03T05:17:00.000Z	ardchoille	ZykoticK9	Sounds like a very good security measure
2010-02-03T05:17:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ardchoille	the GDM setup program that was removed in karmic, had a checkbox to allow it 9.04andearlier
2010-02-03T05:18:00.000Z	ardchoille	ZykoticK9	Ah, yeah
2010-02-03T05:28:00.000Z	ardchoille	ZykoticK9	And I see that you can't disable the user list in gdm either
2010-02-03T05:30:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ardchoille	gdm customization and grub customization or kinda missing in karmic...
2010-02-03T05:31:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ardchoille	s/or/are
2010-02-14T05:58:00.000Z	ardchoille	ZykoticK9	agreed
2010-02-14T05:57:00.000Z	ardchoille	ZykoticK9	~/.bash_profile sources ~/.bashrc itself
2010-02-14T05:57:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ardchoille	i'm just taking it from my .bashrc file - doesn't make much sense i agree
2010-02-14T05:59:00.000Z	ardchoille	ZykoticK9	well .bash_profile is for login shells and .bashrc is for non-login shells, iirc
2010-02-14T06:00:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ardchoille	all we're trying to do is set $PS1 value - any suggestions?
2010-02-14T06:01:00.000Z	ardchoille	ZykoticK9	I do that on each install, here's mine:
2010-02-14T06:02:00.000Z	ardchoille	ZykoticK9	the part you need to change is between the brackets:  [\W @ \t]
2010-02-14T06:02:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ardchoille	ya it's for cant he doesn't have ANY prompt at all right now
2010-04-08T07:23:00.000Z	ardchoille	ZykoticK9	This isn't the place for that
2010-04-13T22:53:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ardchoille	"about 15 days" is actually 16 days from today ;)
