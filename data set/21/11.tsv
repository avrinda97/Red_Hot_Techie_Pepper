2004-11-18T14:17:00.000Z	alka_trash		hey everyone
2004-11-18T14:19:00.000Z	alka_trash		I was thinking that it would nice to have a Ubuntu tweaking section in the forum
2004-11-18T14:19:00.000Z	alka_trash		Like some speed enhancements
2004-11-18T14:20:00.000Z	alka_trash		like removing some unneeded modules
2004-11-18T14:20:00.000Z	alka_trash		maybe
2004-11-18T14:20:00.000Z	alka_trash		and hdparm
2004-11-18T14:20:00.000Z	alka_trash		settings
2004-11-18T14:20:00.000Z	alka_trash		really
2004-11-18T14:21:00.000Z	alka_trash		Hmm there must be somthing
2004-11-18T14:21:00.000Z	alka_trash		how about Xfree
2004-11-18T14:21:00.000Z	mdz	alka_trash	if there were a magic switch to make your system faster, we'd enable it by default :-)
2004-11-18T14:22:00.000Z	alka_trash	mdz	I was thinking there must be something
2004-11-18T14:22:00.000Z	alka_trash		other than cpu specific builds
2004-11-18T14:23:00.000Z	alka_trash		how about pre-linking
2004-11-18T14:23:00.000Z	alka_trash		I've heard that this is a speed up, on some systems
2004-11-18T14:25:00.000Z	mdz	alka_trash	you'd be surprised
2004-11-18T14:26:00.000Z	alka_trash		I am surprised
2004-11-18T14:28:00.000Z	mdz		we already do linker optimization, which, it turns out is a bigger win than prelinking, without the drawbacks
2004-11-18T14:29:00.000Z	alka_trash		I love ubuntu, it's a great OS, and I feel that  ( and probably a lot of people here ) I like to tweak computer setting to get everything customized. My first complaint  : Ubuntu needs to be less polished,  so I have to tweak with the OS.    :) he he
2004-11-18T14:30:00.000Z	mdz	alka_trash	LD_DEBUG=statistics /lib/tls/i686/cmov/ld-linux.so.2 <path to program>
