2011-12-01T14:48:00.000Z	airtonix	arlo	did you look at what /var/log/apache2/error.log contains ?
2011-12-01T14:49:00.000Z	airtonix	arlo	you should also run: sudo apache2ctl configtest
2011-12-01T14:51:00.000Z	airtonix	arlo	ok the error log looks free of problems that would relate to your question, however i did ask you to look at that file on the assumption that you haven't modified the config or are not using any newly created virtualhosts
2011-12-01T14:52:00.000Z	arlo	airtonix	no
2011-12-01T14:52:00.000Z	airtonix	arlo	is your webserver in a production and therefore sensitve? or is it merely a test server?
2011-12-01T14:53:00.000Z	airtonix	arlo	ok, so did 'sudo apache2ctl configtest' return a result?
2011-12-01T14:54:00.000Z	airtonix	arlo	i'd also ask you to pastebin your /etc/apache2/sites-available/default
2011-12-01T14:55:00.000Z	airtonix	arlo	positive? ambigious? negative?
2011-12-01T14:56:00.000Z	airtonix	arlo	another thing you need to "tick off" on your trouble shooting list is to run : 'curl http://localhost' on the same machine that you have the webserver running on
2011-12-01T14:57:00.000Z	airtonix	arlo	and you need to check that ufw has port 80 opened
2011-12-01T14:58:00.000Z	airtonix	arlo	ok if you can access the page at http://localhost, then check that port 80 is open. then you need to make sure your modem/router/adsl/internet thing is forwarding port 80 to your webserver machine
2011-12-01T14:58:00.000Z	arlo	airtonix	can you connect to me with teameiwer?
2011-12-01T14:59:00.000Z	airtonix	arlo	i don't have it installed
2011-12-01T15:14:00.000Z	arlo	airtonix	are you there?
