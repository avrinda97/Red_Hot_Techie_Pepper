2006-01-28T16:15:00.000Z	metalsand		I'm trying to install linux-headers but do not know which version I need
2006-01-28T16:16:00.000Z	metalsand		What is "On 386" imply?
2006-01-28T16:16:00.000Z	metalsand		do I want linux-headers-2.6.12-10 or linux-headers-2.6.12-10-386
2006-01-28T16:16:00.000Z	bimberi	metalsand	sudo aptitude install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
2006-01-28T16:17:00.000Z	metalsand	bimberi	I'm assuming that will install the correct ones automatically?
2006-01-28T16:17:00.000Z	bimberi	metalsand	yes - in fact it will install both of those (-10 depends on -10-386)
2006-01-28T16:18:00.000Z	metalsand	bimberi	Perfect, thank you.
2006-01-28T16:18:00.000Z	bimberi	metalsand	yw :)
2006-01-28T16:18:00.000Z	metalsand	bimberi	Would you recommend I Follow this guide (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HowToInstallTheWlanNgDriverInHoary) to get my Wireless PCMCIA device working?
2006-01-28T16:19:00.000Z	bimberi	metalsand	oops, btw the dependency is the other way around (not really important but i'm a perfectionist :P )
2006-01-28T16:19:00.000Z	metalsand	bimberi	Gotcha. About the guide?
2006-01-28T16:19:00.000Z	metalsand		Do you recommend I follow it?
2006-01-28T16:21:00.000Z	bimberi	metalsand	sorry, i'm not sure, breezy would have additional modules built in (i can see a prism2 module)
2006-01-28T16:21:00.000Z	bimberi	metalsand	actually that's a usb module
2006-01-28T16:21:00.000Z	metalsand	bimberi	I'm in breezy now but I cannot get my PCMCIA wireless device to work correctly, a gooogle search returned this guide
2006-01-28T16:22:00.000Z	bimberi	metalsand	i reckon it's worth a try :)
2006-01-28T16:22:00.000Z	metalsand	bimberi	The drivers that he recommends to download have PCMCIA, usb, ect
2006-01-28T16:22:00.000Z	metalsand		okay. Thanks.
2006-01-28T16:22:00.000Z	bimberi	metalsand	note that the kernel numbers have changed (2.6.12 now)
2006-01-28T16:22:00.000Z	bimberi		s/numbers/versions/
2006-01-28T16:24:00.000Z	bimberi	metalsand	also, i would use checkinstall instead of "make install"
