2005-06-06T09:47:00.000Z	crimmy		skel_home: err...?
2005-06-06T09:47:00.000Z	crimmy		skel_home: are you referring to mozilla-firefox?
2005-06-06T09:48:00.000Z	skel_home	crimmy	yeah, came in here several days ago with that inquery and everyone assured me that the way ubuntu was doing things was the correct way.. I suggested that an updated version number would be most prudent and was shrugged off
2005-06-06T09:49:00.000Z	skel_home	crimmy	so now I have to go read some damn bug submission to get the work around for installing extensions for firefox.
2005-06-06T09:49:00.000Z	crimmy	skel_home	the problem is that Ubuntu's version _isn't_ 1.0.4
2005-06-06T09:49:00.000Z	crimmy	skel_home	it's _only_ security fixes.
2005-06-06T09:49:00.000Z	crimmy	skel_home	to reversion it as 1.0.4 would be misleading and incorrect.
2005-06-06T09:49:00.000Z	skel_home	crimmy	thats fine.. but even debian does stuff like reflect that patch in the package info
2005-06-06T09:50:00.000Z	crimmy	skel_home	there's nothing in the changelog that even remotely suggests that it contains the bugfixes (not security fixes!) from 1.0.4
2005-06-06T09:51:00.000Z	skel_home	crimmy	which change log?
2005-06-06T09:51:00.000Z	skel_home	crimmy	the one for debian?
2005-06-06T09:52:00.000Z	crimmy	skel_home	Ubuntu
2005-06-06T09:53:00.000Z	crimmy	skel_home	mozilla-firefox (1.0.2-0ubuntu5.3) hoary-security; urgency=low
2005-06-06T09:53:00.000Z	skel_home	crimmy	what was the reason for not releasing 1.0.4? I'd imagine it has a high enough userbase to be well enough tested.
2005-06-06T09:54:00.000Z	crimmy	skel_home	it's standard security policy for Ubuntu
2005-06-06T09:54:00.000Z	skel_home	crimmy	I guess I can be greatful enough for security policies =P
2005-06-06T09:55:00.000Z	crimmy	skel_home	security fixes are backported. You can't ensure that a new version (1.0.4) that is a security fix doesn't also introduce new bugs.
2005-06-06T09:56:00.000Z	skel_home	crimmy	so is the policy to wait every 6 months for a new browser version and only release security fixes? that seems like a pretty weak cycle
2005-06-06T09:58:00.000Z	crimmy	skel_home	no, the policy has nothing to do with new versions whatsoever. The policy depends on backporting only the security fixes to whatever version the stable versions released with.
2005-06-06T09:58:00.000Z	skel_home	crimmy	ok. thanks for your time and patience. much appreciated =] 
2005-06-06T09:58:00.000Z	crimmy	skel_home	np
