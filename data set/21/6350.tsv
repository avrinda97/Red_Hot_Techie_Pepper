2007-05-02T06:59:00.000Z	usser	phixnay	its a matter of habit it was weird for me at first too
2007-05-06T07:07:00.000Z	usser	phixnay	alt+tab
2007-05-06T07:07:00.000Z	phixnay	usser	doesn't work
2007-05-06T07:08:00.000Z	phixnay	usser	I mean, it works, just not when I'm playing wesnoth |thunder
2007-05-06T07:32:00.000Z	usser	phixnay	it does but u have to compile it yourself
2007-05-06T07:32:00.000Z	phixnay	usser	okey dokey, so if I want to get rid of it, I just have to keep the source directory and do make uninstall right?
2007-05-06T07:33:00.000Z	usser	phixnay	i'd suggest u check out checkinstall which compiles the stuff and creates a deb package
2007-05-06T07:33:00.000Z	usser	phixnay	which u can later uninstall using synaptics
2007-05-06T07:33:00.000Z	phixnay	usser	nice
2007-05-06T07:33:00.000Z	phixnay	usser	but things that are easy (such as automatix) often come with catches. are there any?
2007-05-06T07:34:00.000Z	usser	phixnay	yes there are u still have to compile the prog, which means reading error messages from console and installing dev libs
2007-05-06T07:34:00.000Z	usser	phixnay	that the pgm needs
2007-05-06T07:35:00.000Z	phixnay	usser	ok, that doesn't sound too bad, I've compiled my own stuff before - but with the package thing, how does that work
2007-05-06T07:36:00.000Z	usser	phixnay	oh it just reads stuff from make install script, asks your for description of package and such and then packs up the deb package and then installs it
2007-05-06T07:36:00.000Z	usser	phixnay	nothing fancy really
2007-05-06T07:36:00.000Z	phixnay	usser	sounds good so far. so do you run it right after "make install" or what?
2007-05-06T07:38:00.000Z	usser	phixnay	u run instead of mae install
2007-05-06T07:38:00.000Z	usser	phixnay	./configure, then make, then sudo checinstall
2007-05-06T07:39:00.000Z	phixnay	usser	aah, thanks.
2007-05-06T07:41:00.000Z	phixnay	usser	just curious, if I did that, could I share the .deb with other people using fiesty?
2007-05-06T07:41:00.000Z	usser	phixnay	yep
