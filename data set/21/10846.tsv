2004-10-29T07:08:00.000Z	Rocha		There are some bugs with the localization of Ubuntu
2004-10-29T07:09:00.000Z	Rocha		I have to change XF86Config by hand to set the keyboard to portuguese
2004-10-29T07:10:00.000Z	Rocha		I have a portuguese keyboard, and XF86Config should have set the keyboard to "pt", not "us"
2004-10-29T07:11:00.000Z	Rocha		That would be great
2004-10-29T07:12:00.000Z	lucas_	Rocha	which language did you selected during install ?
2004-10-29T07:12:00.000Z	Rocha	lucas_	english
2004-10-29T07:13:00.000Z	lucas_	Rocha	that's why it selected the us keyboard
2004-10-29T07:13:00.000Z	Rocha	lucas_	but the command line (bash) is set to portuguese
2004-10-29T07:13:00.000Z	Rocha	lucas_	ok, i have filed 2 already today :)
2004-10-29T07:14:00.000Z	lucas_	Rocha	no need to dpkg-reconfigure locales
2004-10-29T07:17:00.000Z	lucas_	Rocha	don't forget to reportbug, it's important to improve ubuntu's quality
2004-10-29T07:17:00.000Z	lucas_	Rocha	I think the problem is X guess the keyboard to use using the language you selected during install
2004-10-29T07:48:00.000Z	lucas_	Rocha	not only it .pt ;)
2004-10-29T07:53:00.000Z	lucas_	Rocha	distributed ?
2004-10-29T07:54:00.000Z	Rocha	lucas_	unfortunatly in C
2004-10-29T07:54:00.000Z	lucas_	Rocha	which language are you using ?
2004-10-29T07:54:00.000Z	Rocha	lucas_	[14:54]  <Rocha> lucas_, unfortunatly in C
2004-10-29T07:55:00.000Z	lucas_	Rocha	isn't NFSP C ?
2004-10-29T07:56:00.000Z	Rocha	lucas_	i'm using C but I would prefer another language
2004-10-29T07:58:00.000Z	lucas_	Rocha	have you read OS: design & implementation ?
2004-10-29T07:58:00.000Z	Rocha	lucas_	no, just "Operating System Concepts"
