2009-07-02T07:03:00.000Z	scunizi	linux101	5.1?  don't think so .. even if it was numbered that it's so old as to be unusable.
2009-07-02T07:04:00.000Z	scunizi	linux101	can you download the latest or the LTS version and burn it?
2009-07-02T07:05:00.000Z	scunizi	linux101	why can't you install any burning software?
2009-07-02T07:06:00.000Z	scunizi	linux101	AH.. because you installed the older version of ubuntu?
2009-07-02T07:08:00.000Z	scunizi	linux101	you can always order a free cd or visit a friend that has a burner and capacity to download the iso
2009-07-02T07:08:00.000Z	scunizi	linux101	you may also find a magazine with an ubuntu cd in it
2009-07-02T07:08:00.000Z	scunizi	linux101	where are you at in the world?
2009-07-02T07:09:00.000Z	scunizi	linux101	you should have a user's group up there you could get a copy from.. hang on I'll check
2009-07-02T07:11:00.000Z	scunizi	linux101	check this link out and make contact http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=333459
2009-07-02T07:14:00.000Z	scunizi	linux101	someone mentioned that "unetbootin" can be used from a partition like you just mentioned.. however you may have to read a lot to figure out how that works
2009-07-02T07:18:00.000Z	scunizi	linux101	do you have a windows machine?
2009-07-02T07:26:00.000Z	scunizi	linux101	you don't without functional repositories..
2009-07-02T07:28:00.000Z	scunizi	linux101	the oldest repository available is for version 6.06
2009-07-02T07:29:00.000Z	scunizi	linux101	either order the cd, contact the local loco in your area, attempt the netboot install link given earlier
2009-07-02T07:31:00.000Z	scunizi	linux101	you have nothing to loose.  give it a try
2009-07-02T08:05:00.000Z	scunizi	linux101	if you go to windows you can burn a cd of ubuntu
2009-07-02T08:06:00.000Z	scunizi	linux101	as an upgrade only.. you have to already have an install cd to use it
