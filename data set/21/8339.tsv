2007-05-02T09:53:00.000Z	AnAnt	ydo	mine used to work on Edgy
2007-05-02T09:54:00.000Z	ydo	AnAnt	then you ought to add tifm_sd in /etc/modules and then reboot I've read that in some forum
2007-05-02T09:54:00.000Z	AnAnt	ydo	did that
2007-05-02T09:54:00.000Z	ydo	AnAnt	I haven't tried edgy on this computer
2007-05-02T09:54:00.000Z	AnAnt	ydo	tifm_sd is loaded
2007-05-02T09:54:00.000Z	AnAnt	ydo	I just found out that sdhci is also loaded
2007-05-02T09:58:00.000Z	ydo	AnAnt	perhaps you should try upgrade to 2.6.21, there is some code changes in the kernel
2007-05-02T09:59:00.000Z	AnAnt	ydo	that upgrade isn't available, right ?
2007-05-02T09:59:00.000Z	ydo	AnAnt	no I don't think so. you need to build your own kernel
2007-05-02T10:03:00.000Z	AnAnt	ydo	btw, that tifm_sd thing used to work on Edgy
