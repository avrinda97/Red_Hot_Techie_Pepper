2006-06-02T05:28:00.000Z	xnull		how do I configure X for external connection? i want ppl. to connect to my pc
2006-06-02T05:28:00.000Z	Ng	xnull	the login screen admin tool can let you enable remote tcp connections
2006-06-02T05:29:00.000Z	xnull		nb: where is that?
2006-06-02T05:29:00.000Z	Ng	xnull	System->Administration
2006-06-02T05:30:00.000Z	xnull		fugitsu: only Login  window
2006-06-02T05:30:00.000Z	xnull	Ng	ok I configured.. how they are able to connect now ?
2006-06-02T05:31:00.000Z	Ng	xnull	that allows people to export X programs to your display - did you mean you want people to be able to view/control your desktop? If so it'd be System->Preferences->Remote desktop
2006-06-02T05:31:00.000Z	xnull		ng: like remote desktop
2006-06-02T05:32:00.000Z	Ng	xnull	ok in that case you probably want to disable the login screen option you just turned on, then pull up the Remote Desktop preferences and enable it (and probably set a password). People then just need a VNC client and your IP address to connect
2006-06-02T05:32:00.000Z	xnull		ng: i want them to connect with they own users.. etc
2006-06-02T05:34:00.000Z	Ng	xnull	in that case you'll either want XDMCP or Linux Terminal Server I think
2006-06-02T05:35:00.000Z	xnull	Ng	also how do I connect to other computers?
2006-06-02T05:36:00.000Z	Ng	xnull	connect how?
2006-06-02T05:36:00.000Z	xnull	Ng	from my pc to thers..
2006-06-02T05:36:00.000Z	Ng	xnull	I mean, do you want to connect via a command line, take control of their PC, establish a Terminal Server type connection or what?
2006-06-02T05:37:00.000Z	xnull	Ng	take control of the pc
2006-06-02T05:37:00.000Z	Ng	xnull	VNC is probably the easiest option
2006-06-02T05:38:00.000Z	xnull	Ng	do I need to install`it?
2006-06-02T05:38:00.000Z	Ng	xnull	they'll need to install a vnc server and you'll need a vnc client (vncviewer should be installed by default)
2006-06-02T05:39:00.000Z	xnull		ng: where can I find it ?
2006-06-02T05:39:00.000Z	Ng	xnull	I don't remember offhand. Ask google :)
