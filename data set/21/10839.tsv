2004-10-31T16:34:00.000Z	Juerd_		I'm downloading the iso now. It will be on my box in 10 minutes.
2004-10-31T16:34:00.000Z	Juerd_		Should the problem still be there, then can I report the problem to Ubuntu, even though it is a kernel problem?
2004-10-31T16:36:00.000Z	Juerd_		Well, I am a developer, but not when it comes to Linux :)
2004-10-31T16:38:00.000Z	Juerd_		5;1 root@sxark:/# dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda6
2004-10-31T16:38:00.000Z	Juerd_		Here goes.
2004-10-31T16:39:00.000Z	Juerd_		(And I really, really hope it leaves my raid arrays alone this time.)
2004-10-31T16:41:00.000Z	Juerd_		Oh, user.
2004-10-31T16:41:00.000Z	ogra	Juerd_	Xfree
2004-10-31T16:47:00.000Z	ogra	Juerd_	youre not supposed to read the license of cdrecord while burning :)
2004-10-31T16:47:00.000Z	Juerd_	ogra	Then why does it let me wait 9 whole seconds?
2004-10-31T16:48:00.000Z	ogra	Juerd_	cdrecordis crap, but there's nothing better yet
2004-10-31T16:49:00.000Z	Juerd_	ogra	I agree. This is one of those things where some OSS goes wrong.
2004-10-31T16:50:00.000Z	Juerd_	ogra	There's one thing which has been used for years. Even though many agree that it sucks, it takes balls to start a new project that isn't a fork.
2004-10-31T16:57:00.000Z	ogra	Juerd_	id say in burnproof.....
2004-10-31T16:57:00.000Z	Juerd_	ogra	That too, obviously :)
2004-10-31T17:00:00.000Z	ogra	Juerd_	what a line.... wow
2004-11-01T17:00:00.000Z	Juerd_	ogra	I have a local proxy. The line itself isn't bad either, though.
2004-11-01T17:00:00.000Z	Juerd_	ogra	squid serves me well and transparently.
2004-11-01T06:11:00.000Z	Juerd_	ogra	Raid was preserved this time :) Thanks for crossing your fingers
2004-11-01T06:13:00.000Z	ogra	Juerd_	great :)
2004-11-01T06:21:00.000Z	ogra	Juerd_	night
