2008-02-02T09:38:00.000Z	billsey_		how can I get ArdourGTK to install under Gutsy?
2008-02-02T09:39:00.000Z	badkitty	billsey_	 Download the source and makefile
2008-02-02T09:40:00.000Z	badkitty	billsey_	I think it is in ine if the repos too.. did you try a google search?
2008-02-02T09:40:00.000Z	billsey_	badkitty	I am one of those rare bird Linux users that knows nothing about programming. :-)
2008-02-02T09:41:00.000Z	badkitty	billsey_	Hah, no there are many of us like that .. hang on
2008-02-02T09:42:00.000Z	badkitty	billsey_	Check this thread
2008-02-02T09:54:00.000Z	billsey_	badkitty	I looked through the thread, tried the code that it lists, but it can't find the repos that should be there. ArdourGTK remains ghosted in my add/remove. :-(

2008-02-02T09:55:00.000Z	badkitty	billsey_	You have to add the repo yourself
2008-02-02T09:58:00.000Z	billsey_	badkitty	I just looked in Synaptic, and the repos are added there. What else need I do?
2008-02-02T09:59:00.000Z	badkitty	billsey_	Well did you check the packages and and perform the installation?
2008-02-02T10:00:00.000Z	billsey_	badkitty	It said something about a broken pipe. It failed to create a directory or something un ./etc
2008-02-02T10:01:00.000Z	badkitty	billsey_	Did you use the script method or go throughsynaptic?
2008-02-02T10:01:00.000Z	billsey_	badkitty	I think it was GDebi
2008-02-02T10:02:00.000Z	badkitty	billsey_	Hmm I think best way might to be install it from source...
2008-02-02T10:04:00.000Z	billsey_	badkitty	I just tried Synaptic, and I think it might actually work. It's not ghosted there, but only in Add/Remove. I'll check back later to let you know.
2008-02-02T10:04:00.000Z	badkitty	billsey_	ok
2008-02-02T10:05:00.000Z	badkitty	billsey_	I noticed the repo for the link was actually a feisty repo so that could be an issue...Perhaps there was another one I didn't see though
2008-02-02T10:06:00.000Z	billsey_	badkitty	Well, right now, Synaptic is starting to download the packages. It'll be a while since I'm on dial-up.
2008-02-02T10:06:00.000Z	badkitty	billsey_	Wow, that sucks
2008-02-02T10:07:00.000Z	billsey_	badkitty	LOL I've survived so far. :-D
