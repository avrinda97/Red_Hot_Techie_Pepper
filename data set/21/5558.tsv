2010-02-16T07:52:00.000Z	danbhfive	unperson	do you need swap?
2010-02-16T07:53:00.000Z	unperson	danbhfive	I assume I probably could (and should) do without it.  The real issue is that I'd love to be able to hibernate.
2010-02-16T07:54:00.000Z	danbhfive	unperson	ah, I see.  Then yeah, why not use an sd card as swap.  It may destroy the card though
2010-02-16T07:55:00.000Z	unperson	danbhfive	Right.  My thinking was that if I destroy an SD card it's no big deal.
2010-02-16T07:55:00.000Z	unperson	danbhfive	If I destroyed the internal memory it'd be a lot worse.
2010-02-16T07:56:00.000Z	unperson	danbhfive	It may be possible to do hibernate without using swap for virtual memory.  Or else I could at least set swappiness to zero.
2010-02-16T07:57:00.000Z	danbhfive	unperson	ya, sounds good
2010-02-16T07:57:00.000Z	unperson	danbhfive	The problem is that if I setup the SD card as swap and then it's absent I don't know what will happen.
2010-02-16T07:58:00.000Z	danbhfive	unperson	hibernation will fail, that's it, right?
2010-02-16T07:58:00.000Z	unperson	danbhfive	I have no idea if it will boot mostly normally with some error message or if the boot process will freeze or what.
2010-02-16T07:59:00.000Z	danbhfive	unperson	I think nothing will happen in that regard.  The boot always checks for a hibernation entry...
2010-02-16T08:00:00.000Z	unperson	danbhfive	You mean if I tried to resume from hibernate without the SD card.  But generally I don't know what happens if you try to boot and the swap partition from fstab can't be mounted.
2010-02-16T08:01:00.000Z	danbhfive	unperson	nothing, I run without swap all the time
2010-02-16T08:02:00.000Z	unperson	danbhfive	I know you can run without swap just fine, which is what I assume you're doing.  I don't know what happens when the OS is set to use swap but can't find the partition.
2010-02-16T08:03:00.000Z	unperson	danbhfive	I've always had swap on the same physical disk as /, so it never came up.
2010-02-16T08:03:00.000Z	danbhfive	unperson	same thing when you don't have a partition at all.  It just attempts to use the memory it needs.  With 2g of ram, you won't notice anything
2010-02-16T08:03:00.000Z	danbhfive	unperson	unless of course you run allot of stuff...
2010-02-16T08:04:00.000Z	unperson	danbhfive	Nah.  On the early eee's there's not enough CPU to run much.
2010-02-16T08:05:00.000Z	unperson	danbhfive	The physical RAM ought to be plenty, it was just a question of getting hibernation sorted.
2010-02-16T08:06:00.000Z	danbhfive	unperson	yeah, I don't think you are going to have any nonobvious issues
2010-02-16T08:09:00.000Z	unperson	danbhfive	Cool.  I appreciate your perspective on it.  I may just give it a go.  The only thing I have to determine is whether it's possible to make the swap partition available only for hibernation and not virtual memory.
