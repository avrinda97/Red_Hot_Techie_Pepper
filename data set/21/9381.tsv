2005-10-12T09:18:00.000Z	bettong_BOFH	bob2	why is the room blocked to tor users?
2005-10-12T09:18:00.000Z	bob2	bettong_BOFH	due to massive abuse and the fact I can see little point for using tor to come here
2005-10-12T09:19:00.000Z	bob2	bettong_BOFH	it's not about "block someones privacy"
2005-10-13T15:03:00.000Z	bob2	bettong_BOFH	same as you mount anything else
2005-10-13T15:04:00.000Z	bob2	bettong_BOFH	sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/hdbwhatever /mnt
2005-10-15T16:18:00.000Z	bettong_BOFH	bob2	is breezy safe to use now or should i wait?
2005-10-15T16:18:00.000Z	bob2	bettong_BOFH	can you deal with things perhaps breaking, then file useful bug reports?
2005-10-15T16:19:00.000Z	bettong_BOFH	bob2	um no i do not feel that my ability to use linux is up to par to submit bug reports
2005-10-15T16:19:00.000Z	bob2	bettong_BOFH	then I'd wait
2005-10-15T16:24:00.000Z	bob2	bettong_BOFH	there will be no log then
2005-10-15T16:26:00.000Z	bettong_BOFH	bob2	i have noticed a problem with my sound card
2005-10-15T16:26:00.000Z	bob2	bettong_BOFH	that's great
2005-10-15T16:32:00.000Z	bob2	bettong_BOFH	don't use flash, tho it should just work
2005-10-26T06:18:00.000Z	bob2	bettong_BOFH	uh, you don't
2005-10-26T06:18:00.000Z	bob2	bettong_BOFH	if it's a self-extracting zip file, run unzip on it
2005-10-26T06:19:00.000Z	bob2	bettong_BOFH	so, read what I said
2005-10-26T06:19:00.000Z	bob2	bettong_BOFH	"if it's a self-extracting zip file, run unzip on it"
