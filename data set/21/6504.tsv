2007-07-27T10:17:00.000Z	nickrud	punsad	you answered it yourself
2007-07-27T10:17:00.000Z	punsad	nickrud	just curious if it could somehow work - though I highly doubt it
2007-07-27T10:18:00.000Z	punsad	nickrud	it's just that I noticed that apt-spy is available in ununtu
2007-07-27T10:18:00.000Z	nickrud	punsad	yeah, they pull it all over :)
2007-07-27T10:19:00.000Z	nickrud	punsad	breezy & dapper were not even binary compatible, I'm not sure about etch and feisty.
2007-07-27T10:20:00.000Z	nickrud	punsad	yeah, I used it (uselessly) on my 3k dialup :)
2007-07-27T10:20:00.000Z	punsad	nickrud	with a debian system I imagine.  It really works great for debian
2007-07-27T10:21:00.000Z	nickrud	punsad	yes. it's offtopic, but I used unstable for several years before switching to warty.
2007-07-27T10:21:00.000Z	punsad	nickrud	cool.... another debian convert.  I just switched
2007-07-27T10:22:00.000Z	punsad	nickrud	I'm slowly warming up to ubuntu as a longtime debian user
2007-07-27T10:23:00.000Z	nickrud	punsad	It grows on you. For me, it was suddenly not having to integrate stuff, it's done for me. I switched to debian from redhat to get away from rpm hell, and from debian to ubuntu for configuration ease.
2007-07-27T10:25:00.000Z	punsad	nickrud	that's funny.. RH6.1 was the first distro I used for sustained period of time.. then I switched to potato.
2007-09-01T11:55:00.000Z	nickrud	punsad	dreamhost is a debian based one, pretty cheap
2007-09-01T11:55:00.000Z	punsad	nickrud	thanks
2008-01-09T11:42:00.000Z	punsad	nickrud	np.  thanks.. lookss like the post-up <command> might do it
2008-01-09T11:37:00.000Z	nickrud	punsad	you would create a stanza in /etc/network/interfaces to bring it up
2008-01-09T11:39:00.000Z	punsad	nickrud	there is already one that says auto wlan0.  how do I tell it essid and key and mode?
2008-01-09T11:41:00.000Z	nickrud	punsad	ah, now thats a different question :) I've never done it so, sadly, all I can do is point you at man interfaces .
2008-01-09T11:41:00.000Z	nickrud	punsad	I've only set up wired ethernet there. I didn't get wireless until recently and networkmanager has worked for me
