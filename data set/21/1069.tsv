2011-05-25T04:26:00.000Z	jerryitt		*sorry remove grub from the cmd line..
2011-05-25T04:26:00.000Z	nit-wit	jerryitt	remove and do what?
2011-05-25T04:28:00.000Z	nit-wit	jerryitt	your question make no sense, without a what is happening and whats the goal.
2011-05-25T04:29:00.000Z	nit-wit	jerryitt	windows will install grub prompt or not a cd or dvd boots before the grub>     You answer is a dichotomy install or fix what s it.;)
2011-05-25T04:31:00.000Z	jerryitt	nit-wit	sorry full story is this.. I had a duel boot sys. win7 and ubuntu. friend decided to remove win7 and put on win xp, but he just deleted all the partitions in win7 partition manager and now all i get is grub prompt..
2011-05-25T04:31:00.000Z	jerryitt	nit-wit	if i install win i get the same error. so i cannot boot it
2011-05-25T04:31:00.000Z	nit-wit	jerryitt	so you have a wiped HD and a disc to install windows?
2011-05-25T04:32:00.000Z	jerryitt	nit-wit	correct
2011-05-25T04:32:00.000Z	nit-wit	jerryitt	grub is not the problem is the disc not booting when the bios is set to read the disc befor the hd?
2011-05-25T04:33:00.000Z	jerryitt	nit-wit	one thing. i only have a win7 recovery disk. the disk boots and installs win correctly but on rebooti get that error..
2011-05-25T04:34:00.000Z	jerryitt	nit-wit	i have no options in the recovery disk to do anything to the partitions.
2011-05-25T04:34:00.000Z	nit-wit	jerryitt	a recovery disc is only f=good if you have a image for it to install.
2011-05-25T04:36:00.000Z	nit-wit	jerryitt	the f=good was a typo sorry
2011-05-25T04:36:00.000Z	jerryitt	nit-wit	the image installs alright but it will not boot. it goes back to grub.
2011-05-25T04:37:00.000Z	jerryitt	nit-wit	im guessing it doesnt change the mbr?
2011-05-25T04:38:00.000Z	nit-wit	jerryitt	run the recovery disc to tthe language choose it then hit r go to the command line and run bootrec.exe /fixmbr
2011-05-25T04:39:00.000Z	jerryitt	nit-wit	il give that a go.. 2 min :)
2011-05-25T04:39:00.000Z	nit-wit	jerryitt	that should reload the mbr for you and wipe grub out.
2011-05-25T04:42:00.000Z	jerryitt	nit-wit	cheers mate that worked nicely...
2011-05-25T04:42:00.000Z	nit-wit	jerryitt	cool
