2010-07-02T23:00:00.000Z	ohzie	juken	Have you tried rebooting with the headset not plugged in, and then plugging it in afterwards? I know that sounds stupid but trust me on this, sometimes it helps.
2010-07-02T23:00:00.000Z	juken	ohzie	yes :)
2010-07-02T23:01:00.000Z	ohzie	juken	Okay, my next guess is going to be googling pulseaudio and USB headset.
2010-07-02T23:01:00.000Z	ohzie		but I'm not seeing anything
2010-07-02T23:02:00.000Z	juken	ohzie	I've spent countless hours in the past week and a half Googling around for the solution, that's why I eventually posted on the Ubuntu forum and I've also asked in #pulseaudio but no one seems to be able to help.
2010-07-02T23:02:00.000Z	ohzie	juken	I've found a post that may help
2010-07-02T23:02:00.000Z	juken	ohzie	I'd love to see :)
2010-07-02T23:02:00.000Z	ohzie	juken	It basically says switch every preference to alsa and uninstall pulseaudio. =/

2010-07-02T23:02:00.000Z	juken	ohzie	yea, I've seen that as well.
2010-07-02T23:02:00.000Z	ohzie	juken	=\
2010-07-02T23:02:00.000Z	juken	ohzie	when asking around about switching from pulseaudio back to alsa I was told it was a bad idea.
2010-07-02T23:03:00.000Z	ohzie	juken	There may be some truth to that. I haven't had any problems with pulseaudio, but I also do not use a usb headset.
2010-07-02T23:03:00.000Z	ohzie		bluetooth works fine though
2010-07-02T23:04:00.000Z	juken	ohzie	what bothers me is it was working originally.
2010-07-02T23:05:00.000Z	ohzie	juken	OH MAN LIFECHAT that's even the same headset I have at home for the windows machine.
2010-07-02T23:05:00.000Z	juken	ohzie	aye, it works fine on other operating systems
2010-07-02T23:06:00.000Z	ohzie	juken	Historically, windows has had better sound than linux...for....decades. Which is unfortunate, but it's because they set all the standards on anything windows related that uses sound.
2010-07-02T23:06:00.000Z	ohzie		I wonder if there is a way to make a USB headset use ALSA
2010-07-02T23:06:00.000Z	ohzie		instead of Pulse?
2010-07-02T23:07:00.000Z	juken	ohzie	I know, it is quite unfortunate, I had never had issues with sound in Ubuntu, but recently it's been awful.
