2008-03-24T13:41:00.000Z	jeremyreid		heya guys
2008-03-24T13:42:00.000Z	jeremyreid		how do I get world of warcraft to work on ubuntu without crashing (I've tryed wine and crossover, may have done it wrong)
2008-03-24T13:43:00.000Z	jeremyreid		k ty
2008-03-24T13:44:00.000Z	jeremyreid		I have wow installed under wine but it opens up the launcher then the launcher closes what do I do?
2008-03-24T13:45:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jeremyreid	 try launching it from the terminal, so you can look for error messages.
2008-03-24T13:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jeremyreid	 wine .wine/somepath/to/where/the/executalbe/is/wow.exe
2008-03-24T13:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jeremyreid	 cd to .wine/ and look and see where the wow is installed to.. give the right path to the executable.
2008-03-24T13:49:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jeremyreid	 time to learn some shell basics. :)  you MUST give the right path.
2008-03-24T13:50:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jeremyreid	 its pboerbly best to actually cd to where the executable is. so you dont need to give a full path also. saves hassles. with spaces in the path
2008-03-24T13:51:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jeremyreid	 this is when the TAB completion comes in handy. And yes Spaces can casue problems
2008-03-24T13:52:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jeremyreid	 just cd to the proper place.. its not that hard..  cd '.wine/the pat/with spaces'
2008-03-24T13:52:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jeremyreid	 note theuse of the ' quote
2008-03-24T13:53:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jeremyreid	 or slashes like i showed earlier   cd .wine/drive_c/Program\ Files/whatever\ spaces\ need\ a\ slash
2008-03-24T13:54:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jeremyreid	do a ls and pwd and see where you are at. You need 2 quotes...
2008-03-24T13:55:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jeremyreid	 do whatever you want.. but if you want to see some error messages id say use the shell.. i dont use cedega. so cant help with it.
2008-03-24T13:55:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jeremyreid	 and the wow game is one of the most played games under wine/cedega - its got to have 10000's of websites/threads/guides out there.
2008-03-24T13:55:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jeremyreid	  i just use 'wine'
2008-03-24T13:55:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jeremyreid	 you dont need cedega or crosover to play wow
2008-03-24T13:56:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jeremyreid	 no really. :)
2008-03-24T13:59:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jeremyreid	 you totally ignored the 'cd to the dir' part....
2008-03-24T14:00:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jeremyreid	 cd '/home/jeremy/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/World of Warcraft'
