2007-04-17T14:40:00.000Z	steven_		It seems strange to me that Ubuntu would recognize my graphics drivers in the previous version, then mess up on them in the upgrade.
2007-04-17T14:41:00.000Z	stefg	steven_	are you sure you have all the /meta/ - packages installed? a kernel update only works, if all teh related -restricted packages are updated as well
2007-04-17T14:43:00.000Z	stefg	steven_	so what graphic card do you have, and which version of ubuntu do you run?
2007-04-17T14:43:00.000Z	steven_	stefg	I do not know what graphic card I have, and I'm currently running edgy. I upgraded today from dapper. I think part of the problem may come from a power outage I had while the updater was running. I ran the updater, went to work, came back for lunch and the comp was dead.
2007-04-17T14:44:00.000Z	steven_	stefg	how can I find out what graphics card I am running?
2007-04-17T14:45:00.000Z	steven_	stefg	looks like GeForce 6100
2007-04-17T14:45:00.000Z	stefg	steven_	so you expect that a half updated system, which was switched off during essential maintenace just works.... errrmmmm...
2007-04-17T14:45:00.000Z	steven_	stefg	no, I don't. I continued all the downloads via update manager
2007-04-17T14:46:00.000Z	stefg	steven_	so first do ' sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -f install'  first, to get a defined stat
2007-04-17T14:47:00.000Z	steven_	stefg	i ran those, and everything was updated
2007-04-17T14:48:00.000Z	stefg	steven_	sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-`uname -r` nvidia-glx && sudo nvidia-glx enable (note the backticks)
2007-04-17T14:53:00.000Z	steven_	stefg	the apt-get install works, but the command 'nvidia-glx enable' doesn't
2007-04-17T14:54:00.000Z	stefg	steven_	it tells you about 'wrong checksum' or something?
2007-04-17T14:54:00.000Z	steven_	stefg	nah, I get 'command not found'
2007-04-17T14:55:00.000Z	stefg	steven_	doesn't matter... just check in /etc/X11/xorg.conf in section drivers. it has to say 'nvidia' there, not nv
2007-04-17T14:57:00.000Z	steven_	stefg	in xorg.conf, under the device for my video card, it's 'Generic Video Card' with 'vesa' as teh driver
2007-04-17T14:58:00.000Z	stefg	steven_	ahhh..  ok, so you have to 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg' ... choose nvidia s the driver, not nv
2007-04-17T15:00:00.000Z	steven_	stefg	once i run sudo nvidia-config, how soon should it take effect? Do I need to restart?
2007-04-17T15:02:00.000Z	steven_	stefg	thanks! that did it!
2007-04-17T15:02:00.000Z	steven_	stefg	have a nice day!
2007-04-17T15:02:00.000Z	stefg	steven_	np :-)
