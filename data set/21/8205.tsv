2007-02-08T13:01:00.000Z	Akuma_	soundray	grub doesnt seem to play nice with my machine. i tried installing both ubuntu server and xubuntu and i get grub errors
2007-02-08T13:02:00.000Z	soundray	Akuma_	any error code?
2007-02-08T13:02:00.000Z	Akuma_	soundray	yes, 15 and 18
2007-02-08T13:02:00.000Z	soundray	Akuma_	and have you got a specific reason to assume that lilo would work better?
2007-02-08T13:03:00.000Z	Akuma_	soundray	google tells me that error 15 is probably because grub cant file vmlinuz - i checked the path in menu.lst and its fine though.
2007-02-08T13:03:00.000Z	Akuma_	soundray	i dont, but i thought i'd try it out; i dont know what else to do
2007-02-08T13:04:00.000Z	soundray	Akuma_	where on the hard disk is your xubuntu partition? Is it a huge disk?
2007-02-08T13:08:00.000Z	Akuma_	soundray	i tried on two disks, 6GB and 20GB. i installed trying a few partition methods, but always with  / and swap partitions only
2007-02-08T13:08:00.000Z	Akuma_	soundray	every time i completely erase the whole disk
2007-02-08T13:09:00.000Z	soundray	Akuma_	good, that excludes a few potential error sources. Is your BIOS up to dealing with disks of that size?
2007-02-08T13:11:00.000Z	Akuma_	soundray	the system used to work as it is, about 6 years ago - except it used to run win98 i think
2007-02-08T13:15:00.000Z	soundray	Akuma_	get a grub command line (hit 'c' on the boot menu) and run 'geometry (hd0)' and 'geometry (hd1)'. Do you notice any strangeness?
2007-02-08T13:18:00.000Z	Akuma_	soundray	doing that, just a sec
2007-02-08T13:20:00.000Z	Akuma_	soundray	there's no way i can get anything command-line-ish. i get the error right away
2007-02-08T13:20:00.000Z	soundray	Akuma_	hmm...
2007-02-08T13:21:00.000Z	soundray	Akuma_	do you have a floppy drive?
2007-02-08T13:22:00.000Z	Akuma_	soundray	i do
2007-02-08T13:23:00.000Z	soundray	Akuma_	you might try booting a generic grub floppy. The GNU grub site has floppy images.
2007-02-08T13:25:00.000Z	soundray	Akuma_	use the find command to find your kernel, then use 'root', 'kernel', 'initrd' and 'boot' to boot it
