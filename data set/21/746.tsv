2011-07-17T13:00:00.000Z	glebihan	kaellan	where did you get the source from ?
2011-07-17T13:08:00.000Z	glebihan	kaellan	what command does bring the error message you mentioned ?
2011-07-17T13:09:00.000Z	kaellan	glebihan	make
2011-07-17T13:10:00.000Z	kaellan	glebihan	most of the time "git submodule update --init" dosnt work either
2011-07-17T13:11:00.000Z	glebihan	kaellan	did you check that the path in the command ./autogen.sh --with-xulrunner-sdk="/usr/lib/xulrunner-1.9.2.12" was the correct one (check the version of xulrunner installed on your system)
2011-07-17T13:12:00.000Z	kaellan	glebihan	i change version to 2.0"
2011-07-17T13:12:00.000Z	kaellan	glebihan	and i got the 2.0 and -dev pack
2011-07-17T13:13:00.000Z	kaellan	glebihan	does it work for you?
2011-07-17T13:13:00.000Z	glebihan	kaellan	no but I'm not getting the same error message as you are... looking into it
2011-07-17T13:17:00.000Z	glebihan	kaellan	looks like they forgot a few dependencies in that tutorial, this one seems to have worked for me : http://ubuntu-tutorials.com/2010/11/26/install-firesheep-on-ubuntu-10-04-or-10-10/
2011-07-17T13:17:00.000Z	kaellan	glebihan	oh thx :)
2011-07-17T13:17:00.000Z	glebihan	kaellan	you're welcome, let me know if it works
2011-07-17T13:23:00.000Z	kaellan	glebihan	nice got some progress now finaly <3
2011-07-17T13:29:00.000Z	kaellan	glebihan	how to get a older verion of firefox? :)
2011-07-17T13:29:00.000Z	glebihan	kaellan	why would you want an older version ? firesheep isn't supported on the latest one ?
2011-07-17T13:30:00.000Z	kaellan	glebihan	not suported in newer ones, need like ff 3.5 to 3.6 ^^
2011-07-17T13:33:00.000Z	kaellan	glebihan	not suported in newer ones, need like ff 3.5 to 3.6 ^^
2011-07-17T13:33:00.000Z	kaellan	glebihan	3.6 i need
2011-07-17T13:37:00.000Z	glebihan	kaellan	you would have to uninstall your current version and manually install an older one, but I would not really recommend it
2011-07-17T13:37:00.000Z	glebihan	kaellan	isn't there any other equivalent extension that you could use with your current version of firefox ?
2011-07-17T13:38:00.000Z	kaellan	glebihan	dont know, ^^ im using chromium usualy so just gona get firefox and this firesheep to steal cookies :D
