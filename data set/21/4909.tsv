2008-01-19T00:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	rEph	aptoncd or puit them in var/cache/apt/archives
2008-01-19T00:03:00.000Z	rEph	Jack_Sparrow	how about updating the package tree networklessly
2008-01-19T00:03:00.000Z	rEph	Jack_Sparrow	so I can use the updated packages I have =)
2008-01-19T00:03:00.000Z	rEph	Jack_Sparrow	see,  yeh... problem is though ;)  it's a colocated box
2008-01-19T00:03:00.000Z	rEph	Jack_Sparrow	however its a failover box on a backend  with no direcyt net connection
2008-01-19T00:04:00.000Z	rEph	Jack_Sparrow	so we have to use the front end live box to get the pkgs and move them back to the failover box,  heh
2008-01-19T00:05:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	rEph	Which is why I made the suggestion I did,... You have to get them into there somehow and if there is not internet or network you will have to move them manually
2008-01-19T00:06:00.000Z	rEph	Jack_Sparrow	yeah,  I understand however we have no manual access I can ssh -> front end ,  ssh -> failover without "network"   it has network,  but i cannot modify the front end to proxy traffic from the backend which has no direct net access :p
2008-01-19T00:06:00.000Z	rEph	Jack_Sparrow	its a real annoying mess tbh...but its how it has to be
2008-01-19T00:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	rEph	I dont have an answer for something setup like that
2008-01-19T00:07:00.000Z	rEph	Jack_Sparrow	basically the idea is how can I manually yet with no physical acces, yet remotely without internet access,  update a package tree...
2008-01-19T00:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	rEph	Good luck...
2008-01-19T00:09:00.000Z	rEph	Jack_Sparrow	ok we can use that hwoever...is there a cli aptoncd =)
2008-01-19T00:10:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	rEph	Please read the link.. it is quite informative
2008-01-19T00:11:00.000Z	rEph	Jack_Sparrow	which link =s... the !aptoncd didn't provide one that I saw
2008-01-19T00:11:00.000Z	rEph	Jack_Sparrow	sorry not used to such highspeed
2008-01-19T00:13:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	rEph	Please read the link.. http://aptoncd.sourceforge.net/
2008-01-19T00:16:00.000Z	rEph	Jack_Sparrow	yeh,  I see no cli methods for aptoncd...real shame
2008-01-19T00:16:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	rEph	You have a very unusual situation...  I dont have an answer nor have I seen anything that would work for you
