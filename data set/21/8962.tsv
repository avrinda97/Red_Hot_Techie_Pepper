2005-12-08T17:37:00.000Z	dli		does ubuntu installation create a non-root user by default?
2005-12-08T17:38:00.000Z	djk_	dli	no, just the user you create during installation
2005-12-08T17:39:00.000Z	dli	djk_	then, I'm worried, a nonexperienced user might use the default account for everything
2005-12-08T17:39:00.000Z	djk_	dli	why
2005-12-08T17:40:00.000Z	dli	djk_	the default user are in root group?
2005-12-08T17:40:00.000Z	djk_	dli	sudoer
2005-12-08T17:41:00.000Z	dli	djk_	it's still like windows?
2005-12-08T17:41:00.000Z	dli	djk_	the default user doesn't need a passwd to run root
2005-12-08T17:42:00.000Z	djk_	dli	you can create a root account if you want and remove the default user from the sudoers list or just add a new user without sudo rights.
2005-12-08T17:43:00.000Z	djk_	dli	ubuntu only has one because it's "easier" for noobs to remember only one password and bla..
2005-12-08T17:43:00.000Z	dli	djk_	I recommend ubuntu for n00bs only :(
2005-12-08T17:43:00.000Z	dli	djk_	I didn't realize ubuntu follows the windows way
2005-12-08T17:43:00.000Z	djk_	dli	if they are literate, there shouldn't be a problem.
2005-12-08T17:44:00.000Z	djk_	dli	wrong, windows sorta followed *nix...
2005-12-08T17:44:00.000Z	djk_	dli	besides, for everything that needs root the user needs to enter the user pw
2005-12-08T17:44:00.000Z	dli	djk_	unix restricts root usage, sudoer is not the answer, a script worm can get root
2005-12-08T17:46:00.000Z	dli	djk_	oh, it's still passwd protected? then, that should be okay
2005-12-08T17:46:00.000Z	djk_	dli	aren't you using ubuntu?
2005-12-08T17:46:00.000Z	djk_	dli	might be better to check out a distro before recommending it to others ;)
2005-12-08T17:47:00.000Z	dli	djk_	no, I only recommend linux for friends who are tired of endless windows spywares and viruses
2005-12-08T17:47:00.000Z	dli	djk_	I heard it's debian based, didn't realize what they did with root
