2008-01-11T00:15:00.000Z	slyfox		Hi please, help - I right clicked on a folder and chose properties and set it to open with Totem MEdia PLayer. Now nautilus open all folders with Totem and it is messed up. How do I restore Nautilus to function back to default. Help.

2008-01-11T00:16:00.000Z	slyfox	kalchas	I cant access any folders, there are none on my desktop and My Places does not open

2008-01-11T00:21:00.000Z	slyfox	kalchas	as I type it autofills "nautilus-"
2008-01-11T00:21:00.000Z	slyfox	kalchas	nothing happens still
2008-01-11T00:21:00.000Z	kalchas		you could try to re-install it via synaptic I guess.
2008-01-11T00:22:00.000Z	slyfox	kalchas	wow, I just saw this in the terminal "The program 'nautilus' is currently not installed.  You can install it by typing:
2008-01-11T00:22:00.000Z	slyfox		sudo apt-get install nautilus
2008-01-11T00:22:00.000Z	slyfox		"
2008-01-11T00:22:00.000Z	slyfox	kalchas	installing it now
2008-01-11T00:23:00.000Z	kalchas	slyfox	why would it be uninstalled though...
2008-01-11T00:23:00.000Z	slyfox	kalchas	It might be possible that I deleted the folder nautilus thinking it was just a configuration for nautilus
2008-01-11T00:23:00.000Z	kalchas		ouch!
2008-01-11T00:24:00.000Z	kalchas	slyfox	well, carefull w/ that sudo...
