2005-05-01T11:49:00.000Z	nydust		Why doesnt synaptic install the apache2.conf file?
2005-05-01T11:49:00.000Z	nydust		its missing, thats why my apache is not working
2005-05-01T11:50:00.000Z	Raskall	nydust	where are you looking for it? apache2.conf got finely installed in /etc/apache2
2005-05-01T11:50:00.000Z	nydust	Raskall	i was looking in /ect/apache2
2005-05-01T11:50:00.000Z	nydust	Raskall	but its not there
2005-05-01T11:51:00.000Z	nydust	Raskall	when i do a /usr/sbin/apache2 restart it says it dont find the file
2005-05-01T11:53:00.000Z	Raskall	nydust	try "sudo apt-get remove --purge apache2" and then "sudo apt-get install apache2" from the command line.
2005-05-01T11:54:00.000Z	nydust	Raskall	hope it works!!!
2005-05-01T11:54:00.000Z	Raskall	nydust	good luck. the first command removes apache2 completely and the second reinstalls it.
2005-05-01T11:56:00.000Z	nydust	Raskall	now i have the apache2.conf but still not working
2005-05-01T11:57:00.000Z	Raskall	nydust	have you started it from /etc/init.d?
2005-05-01T11:57:00.000Z	nydust	Raskall	yes
2005-05-01T11:57:00.000Z	Raskall	nydust	should work.
2005-05-01T11:58:00.000Z	nydust	Raskall	i will try to take an remove --purge on everything with apache2
2005-05-01T11:59:00.000Z	Raskall	nydust	sounds like a good idea.
2005-05-01T11:59:00.000Z	Raskall	nydust	do a "dpkg -l |grep apache2"  to see all  your apache2 related installed packages
2005-05-01T12:00:00.000Z	Raskall	nydust	but I guess you will have to open apache2.conf and do some initial config. The comments should tell you what you need to change.
2005-05-01T12:02:00.000Z	nydust	Raskall	finnaly its working
2005-05-01T12:02:00.000Z	Raskall	nydust	:) good.
2005-05-01T12:02:00.000Z	nydust	Raskall	you are my hero
2005-05-01T12:02:00.000Z	Raskall	nydust	*blush*
