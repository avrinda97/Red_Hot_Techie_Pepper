2006-09-27T05:53:00.000Z	_m0nk		hey guys
2006-09-27T05:53:00.000Z	_m0nk		i was wondering if you guys could help me with something
2006-09-27T05:54:00.000Z	_m0nk		i have an SSH server setup...and i was wondering if you guy scould tell me how to get X forwarding to work
2006-09-27T05:55:00.000Z	_m0nk		i am using puTTy to connect to my laptop right now if that helps with my question at all
2006-09-27T05:56:00.000Z	mcphail	_m0nk	you can't forward X unless you are running an X server on your local machine
2006-09-27T05:56:00.000Z	_m0nk		my n00b bad
2006-09-27T05:56:00.000Z	mcphail	_m0nk	try installing cygwin
2006-09-27T05:57:00.000Z	_m0nk		do i need cygwin on any windows boxes i use?
2006-09-27T05:57:00.000Z	_m0nk		because i am setting this up more for my *at school use*
2006-09-27T05:58:00.000Z	mcphail	_m0nk	as far as i am aware you will have to run an X server on any machine you wish to forward X to
2006-09-27T05:58:00.000Z	_m0nk		ok are there any Java based apps for that, that i can download?
2006-09-27T05:59:00.000Z	_m0nk		java is the ONE thing my school cant take from me:)
2006-09-27T05:59:00.000Z	mcphail	_m0nk	the alternative would be to use vnc or nx
2006-09-27T05:59:00.000Z	_m0nk		i see
2006-09-27T06:00:00.000Z	_m0nk		i can stick with text terminals i guess:) those are more 1337 than VNC
2006-09-27T06:00:00.000Z	_m0nk		and i dont want to open up anymore ports on my router
2006-09-27T06:01:00.000Z	mcphail	_m0nk	if you run nx you won't need to open any new ports
2006-09-27T06:01:00.000Z	_m0nk		i wont? it will work through port 22?
2006-09-27T06:01:00.000Z	mcphail	_m0nk	(it uses ssh)
2006-09-27T06:01:00.000Z	_m0nk	mcphail	thats what i like to hear:) you get my attention when you say SSH:)
2006-09-27T06:02:00.000Z	mcphail	_m0nk	the server is in the seveas repository, but it is a little bit of a fiddle to set up
