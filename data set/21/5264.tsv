2008-05-04T06:13:00.000Z	tanath		hmm, my update manager is no longer notifying me of updates...
2008-05-04T06:14:00.000Z	Mimi	tanath	 how often do you have it set up to check for updates?
2008-05-04T06:14:00.000Z	tanath	Mimi	daily
2008-05-04T06:14:00.000Z	tanath	Mimi	i have updates now, but no notification
2008-05-04T06:14:00.000Z	Mimi	tanath	 and youre noticing that there are more than one update a day? if thats the case it will only check 1 time per day regardless of how many there are that day
2008-05-04T06:15:00.000Z	tanath	Mimi	i know that. but twice now, i opened update manager and found there were updates
2008-05-04T06:15:00.000Z	tanath	Mimi	i just opened in now, and there's 20
2008-05-04T06:16:00.000Z	tanath	Mimi	before, i couldn't get rid of an alert saying my package info is out of date. now, since they updated the update manager, it doesn't alert me at all
2008-05-04T06:16:00.000Z	tanath	Mimi	and apparently i'm not the only one
2008-05-04T06:17:00.000Z	Mimi	tanath	 mmm i dont know then :/  ... sorries
2008-05-04T06:20:00.000Z	tanath	Mimi	i don't appear to have the update daemon thingy running. do you know what it's called?
2008-05-04T06:20:00.000Z	Mimi	tanath	 I can check    1 sec
2008-05-04T06:21:00.000Z	Mimi	tanath	  it's called update-notifier   thats how it is on my session properties
2008-05-04T06:22:00.000Z	tanath	Mimi	right. *smacks forehead*
2008-05-04T06:23:00.000Z	tanath	Mimi	that was the problem. it wasn't running. i ran it, and now got the alert
2008-05-04T06:24:00.000Z	Mimi	tanath	 hehe that's silly ^_^;; it happens
2008-05-04T06:24:00.000Z	tanath	Mimi	i think it's because i killed it to make that alert go away :P
2008-05-04T06:25:00.000Z	tanath	Mimi	XD
2008-05-04T06:25:00.000Z	tanath	Mimi	it was having issues. there was a bug. killing it was necessary
2008-05-10T07:57:00.000Z	tanath	Mimi	that generally doesn't search _within_ files
2008-05-10T07:58:00.000Z	Mimi	tanath	 I thought he meant, "the word is part of the file name", not  "the word is INSIDE the file name" my mistake ^_^;;
