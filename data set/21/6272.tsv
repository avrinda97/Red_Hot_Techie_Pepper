2010-03-22T05:28:00.000Z	Gnea	h4ck3rk1ng	no.
2010-03-22T05:29:00.000Z	Gnea	h4ck3rk1ng	first of all, read the wifi docs, and stop repeating the paste, we got it the first time.
2010-03-22T05:29:00.000Z	Gnea	h4ck3rk1ng	if you want it quickly, don't spam. otherwise, we take longer.
2010-03-22T05:31:00.000Z	Gnea	h4ck3rk1ng	why can't you just read the wifi docs on the web?
2010-03-22T05:34:00.000Z	Gnea	h4ck3rk1ng	have you read this page? please, read it, don't give me a lame excuse again: http://www.linux-netbook.com/
2010-03-22T06:00:00.000Z	Gnea	h4ck3rk1ng	why aren't you using ubuntu netbook remix?
2010-03-22T06:10:00.000Z	Gnea	h4ck3rk1ng	I told you before what steps to take.
2010-03-22T06:10:00.000Z	Gnea	h4ck3rk1ng	then you don't really need help.
2010-03-22T06:10:00.000Z	Gnea	h4ck3rk1ng	you need to read the wifi docs website.
2010-03-22T06:11:00.000Z	Gnea	h4ck3rk1ng	no, read the site.
