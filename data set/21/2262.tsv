2009-11-23T11:16:00.000Z	GammaX		I recently upgraded 9.04 UE to 9.10, is there a way to roll back to 9.04?
2009-11-23T11:17:00.000Z	landry	GammaX	backup?
2009-11-23T11:17:00.000Z	GammaX	landry	I didnt
2009-11-23T11:18:00.000Z	landry	GammaX	did you check the grub menu?
2009-11-23T11:19:00.000Z	GammaX	landry	nope
2009-11-23T11:19:00.000Z	landry	GammaX	when you boot check to see if there's an entry for 9.04
2009-11-23T11:19:00.000Z	GammaX	landry	 ohh im sorry for the lapse, it says all 9.10
2009-11-23T11:20:00.000Z	landry	GammaX	try "Safe Mode?"
2009-11-23T11:21:00.000Z	GammaX	landry	reffering to from the grub menu?
2009-11-23T11:21:00.000Z	landry	GammaX	yes
2009-11-23T11:21:00.000Z	landry	GammaX	The next line down from the default selection
2009-11-23T11:22:00.000Z	GammaX	landry	I think it said restore mode or something, Im in it now but it doesnt auto sense the touchpad or sound
2009-11-23T11:22:00.000Z	landry	GammaX	have you tried live boot from the CD?
2009-11-23T11:23:00.000Z	GammaX	landry	Nope, If I do the live boot what will be the purpose ( in reguards to what will I do )
2009-11-23T11:24:00.000Z	landry	GammaX	to see if your touchpad and stuff works.
2009-11-23T11:24:00.000Z	GammaX	landry	 ahhhh ok
2009-11-23T11:25:00.000Z	landry	GammaX	;)
2009-11-23T11:28:00.000Z	GammaX	landry	also the only kernel wich works is 2.6.28-13
2009-11-23T11:30:00.000Z	landry	GammaX	only 2.6.28-13 boots?
2009-11-23T11:30:00.000Z	GammaX	landry	the others either hang or the screen continuously glitches and I can not do anything.
2009-11-23T11:32:00.000Z	GammaX	landry	Also when I go to update manager it says not all updates can be installed, when I run a partial upgrade it says could not calculate the upgrade you have held broken pachages...
