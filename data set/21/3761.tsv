2009-02-10T01:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	adi1	tilda or yakuake
2009-11-03T16:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	adi1	users cannot mount partitions
2010-05-03T23:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	adi1	checked bug reports?
2010-08-04T23:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	adi1	run: sudo lshw -C display ,websearch for the product line to find guides
2010-08-04T23:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	adi1	well yeah, thought that was glaringly obvious
2010-08-04T23:30:00.000Z	adi1	ActionParsnip	: that comand gives me info about the SIS
2010-08-04T23:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	adi1	then its a SiS video card
2010-08-04T23:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	adi1	copy the product line and use it in websearches
2010-08-04T23:31:00.000Z	adi1	ActionParsnip	: so how can i update the driver ?
2010-08-04T23:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	adi1	your driver is in a stock install, you just need config
2010-08-04T23:32:00.000Z	adi1	ActionParsnip	how can i config this in ubuntu?
2010-08-04T23:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	adi1	the guides you find will help / tell you. Sis can be a pain and I don't believe will give 3D accelleration (no compiz muck)
2010-08-04T23:33:00.000Z	adi1	ActionParsnip	i dont want 3d
2010-08-04T23:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	adi1	ok that's cool
2010-08-04T23:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	adi1	the guides will most likely give suggestions for details in xorg.conf
2010-08-04T23:34:00.000Z	adi1	ActionParsnip	do you think this card can support higher resolution than 960X900?
2010-08-04T23:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	adi1	yes! You just need to configure it. Also depends what your screen can handle
2010-08-04T23:35:00.000Z	adi1	ActionParsnip	ok thanks
