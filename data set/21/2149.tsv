2009-12-31T04:35:00.000Z	frederick85		hi i just upgraded to karmic koala and i have alot of problems, the first problem i have is the new kernel doesn't load so i'm running the system using the old kernel
2009-12-31T04:36:00.000Z	[S|G]	frederick85	what happens with the new kernel? no error messages at all?
2009-12-31T04:37:00.000Z	frederick85	[S|G]	it just outputs data i have no understanding of,
2009-12-31T04:37:00.000Z	frederick85	[S|G]	no error messages just stuff i'v never experienced before
2009-12-31T04:38:00.000Z	[S|G]	frederick85	any chance that they were recorded on /var/log/messages ?
2009-12-31T04:40:00.000Z	frederick85	[S|G]	no just seems like the kernel that worked only was recorded, also i can't seem to go into update manager, it says the sources list can't be parsed or something
2009-12-31T04:41:00.000Z	[S|G]	frederick85	can you put your sources.list on pastebin?
2009-12-31T04:42:00.000Z	[S|G]	frederick85	the contents of /etc/apt/sources.list
2009-12-31T04:43:00.000Z	[S|G]		victor__? isnt freshclam working?

2009-12-31T04:46:00.000Z	frederick85	[S|G]	when i did my distribution upgrade it didn't automatically clean up, the upgrade stopped and i couldn't get back to it
2009-12-31T04:46:00.000Z	[S|G]	frederick85	hm.... did you try to finish the upgrade? you could try "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade"
2009-12-31T04:47:00.000Z	[S|G]	frederick85	you might have some broken packages
2009-12-31T04:47:00.000Z	frederick85	[S|G]	it says it encounters a section with no package header
2009-12-31T04:48:00.000Z	[S|G]	frederick85	can you paste the contents of your /etc/apt/sources.list on pastebin? or send it to my on a private message?
2009-12-31T04:49:00.000Z	frederick85	[S|G]	http://pastebin.com/m4f949078 here it is
2009-12-31T04:50:00.000Z	[S|G]	frederick85	what if you try: "sudo apt-get clean all && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade"
2009-12-31T04:51:00.000Z	frederick85	[S|G]	it gives the same error
2009-12-31T04:52:00.000Z	[S|G]	frederick85	what is the exact error message?
