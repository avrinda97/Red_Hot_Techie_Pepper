2009-11-08T10:51:00.000Z	soreau	dno	What command gives you that?
2009-11-08T10:52:00.000Z	dno	soreau	 Any thoughts?
2009-11-08T10:53:00.000Z	soreau	dno	Try sudo sshfs <user>@192.168.1.168:/backup /media/backup
2009-11-08T10:53:00.000Z	soreau	dno	Replace <user> with the actual user name
2009-11-08T10:55:00.000Z	dno	soreau	 It says sshfs command not found?  I need apt-get sshfs?

2009-11-08T10:59:00.000Z	soreau	dno	Sounds like the system you're trying to connect to isn't configured for ssh
2009-11-08T11:01:00.000Z	dno	soreau	 Well, I used all the same settings in 8.04.  and it worked.  Now it is like I get to the nas type in the password and it denies me permission.
2009-11-08T11:02:00.000Z	soreau	dno	Sounds like a configuration issue. Can you ssh into the other box from there and vice versa?
2009-11-08T11:04:00.000Z	dno	soreau	I can still get in from my 8.04 and winbloze boxes.
2009-11-08T11:04:00.000Z	soreau	dno	idk then
2009-11-08T11:04:00.000Z	dno	soreau	 Thanks for trying!
