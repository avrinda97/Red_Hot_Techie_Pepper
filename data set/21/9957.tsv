2005-06-22T16:39:00.000Z	Eudoxus		I'm having a trouble with xmms. It hangs when I start to play a file. Why
2005-06-22T16:40:00.000Z	anto9us	Eudoxus	delete ~/.xmms/config
2005-06-22T16:40:00.000Z	Eudoxus	anto9us	I shall try.
2005-06-22T16:42:00.000Z	anto9us	Eudoxus	mine did ;)
2005-06-22T16:43:00.000Z	Eudoxus	anto9us	u sure?
2005-06-22T16:43:00.000Z	Eudoxus	anto9us	because the file has reappeared again and it's still working :)
2005-06-22T16:43:00.000Z	anto9us	Eudoxus	did it work before you started playing around with visualisations?
2005-06-22T16:43:00.000Z	Eudoxus	anto9us	nah I believe the other thing about esd did the trick
2005-06-22T16:44:00.000Z	anto9us	Eudoxus	I was teasing, I really don't know which worked mate
2005-06-22T16:49:00.000Z	anto9us	Eudoxus	Firestarter is a gui which will allow you to configure internet connection sharing
2005-06-22T16:50:00.000Z	Eudoxus	anto9us	i'll take a look
2005-06-22T05:27:00.000Z	anto9us	Eudoxus	does it seem to delay while looking up address?
2005-06-22T05:27:00.000Z	Eudoxus	anto9us	yea when it says Connecting to <some page>
2005-06-22T05:28:00.000Z	anto9us	Eudoxus	the delay is before or after it says connecting?
2005-06-22T05:28:00.000Z	Eudoxus	anto9us	while it is connecting
2005-06-22T05:30:00.000Z	anto9us	Eudoxus	so address resolution is quick and transfer is quick but the bit in between isn't, right?
2005-06-22T05:35:00.000Z	anto9us	Eudoxus	underneath query time what was the Server adress?
2005-06-22T05:35:00.000Z	Eudoxus	anto9us	130.208.165.82#53(130.208.165.82)
2005-06-22T05:36:00.000Z	anto9us	Eudoxus	I get a good response time from that, around 90ms
2005-06-22T05:45:00.000Z	anto9us	Eudoxus	that's not bad
2005-06-22T05:46:00.000Z	anto9us	Eudoxus	1003 I think
