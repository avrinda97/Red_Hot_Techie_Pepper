2007-08-15T07:22:00.000Z	fredl		hi guys, not really an Ubuntu question, but I recently added a (third) disk to my system which is a PATA disk. It installed itself before the two SATA disks that had both Ubuntu and XP on it. Not a big deal as I wanted to do a new (64 bit) install of Ubuntu anyways. However, my XP does not start anymore now. GRUB sees it alright and starts loading it, but because XP thinks it's installed on the first disk it thinks it can boot up from there.

2007-12-15T14:22:00.000Z	fredl	scguy318	this may be of help too, lspci lists: 00:11.2 USB Controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82xxxxx UHCI USB 1.1 Controller (rev 1b)
2007-12-15T14:23:00.000Z	scguy318	fredl	it's not that, because USB 2.0 devices should be backwards compatible with 1.1
2007-12-15T14:23:00.000Z	scguy318	fredl	personally I think it might be something hardware-wise, but don't take me as the final word
