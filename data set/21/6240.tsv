2007-05-04T06:55:00.000Z	Fabier		Hey all, quick question for anyone who has a minute
2007-05-04T06:56:00.000Z	Fabier		there is a project out there called "Wubi" which installs Ubuntu into a file on a windows install
2007-05-04T06:56:00.000Z	Fabier		is there a project that does this but in reverse?
2007-05-04T06:56:00.000Z	Fabier		install windows into a file on linux?
2007-05-04T06:56:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Fabier	you can emulate windows on Linux
2007-05-04T06:57:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Fabier	you can use VMware or something like that
2007-05-04T06:59:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Fabier	nothing that would do that
2007-05-04T06:59:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Fabier	I dual-boot, so I can play C&C3
2007-05-04T06:59:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Fabier	I use Parallels for small windows things, you might want to look into Cadega
2007-05-04T07:01:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Fabier	Cadega
2007-05-04T07:02:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Fabier	it is meant to play games, but it isn't free
2007-05-04T07:02:00.000Z	Fabier	bobbob1016	Have you used it? I looked at their site and wasn't too impressed with the public rating of their software.
2007-05-04T07:03:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Fabier	I haven't, I just dual-boot
2007-05-04T07:03:00.000Z	Fabier	bobbob1016	Ah. Oh well.
2007-05-04T07:04:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Fabier	it might be easier to repartition, or add a second drive, then put windows on there, it will mess with your boot-loader though.  You could try to remove the Ubuntu drive, then install windows on the new drive, and plug the ubuntu drive in as the master drive, and windows as the slave, then add the windows drive to your grub config
2007-05-04T07:05:00.000Z	Fabier	bobbob1016	Yeah, I'm not a fan of windows attempts to dominate the system :P
2007-05-04T07:05:00.000Z	Fabier	bobbob1016	Unfortunately, this is a laptop. So... removing drives is not an option.
2007-05-04T07:06:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Fabier	then try a GTParted live CD to partition a bit of space, then install windows, then rebuild grub
2007-05-04T07:06:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Fabier	or lilo, whichever you use
2007-05-04T07:07:00.000Z	Fabier	bobbob1016	Grub :).
2007-05-04T07:08:00.000Z	bobbob1016	Fabier	that's your loader, the "Press esc in two seconds" to get more options
