2005-05-03T14:17:00.000Z	Seveas	dave_	CUT IT OUT IDIOTQ
2005-05-20T11:02:00.000Z	Seveas	dave_	what's the problem>
2005-05-20T11:03:00.000Z	dave_	Seveas	I've done an apt-get install of webmin, then made a symbolic link into my /var/www directory. But when I try to access the page it won't handle the perl script
2005-05-20T11:04:00.000Z	dave_	Seveas	Firefox wants to download the script
2005-05-20T11:04:00.000Z	Seveas	dave_	are you running apache too?
2005-05-20T11:04:00.000Z	dave_	Seveas	I've got apache running as well as mysql, php4 and perl installed
2005-05-20T11:05:00.000Z	Seveas	dave_	please read the webmin docs to see how to access it :)
2005-05-20T11:06:00.000Z	dave_	Seveas	I'm thinking my server is not handling the perl script properly
2005-05-20T11:07:00.000Z	Seveas	dave_	your webserver should not handle it
2005-05-20T11:07:00.000Z	dave_	Seveas	doesn't apache parse the script and produce html output
2005-09-23T07:36:00.000Z	Seveas	dave_	apokryphos, that one is broken atm
2005-10-31T10:04:00.000Z	dave_	Seveas	soory i cant speak English :((
2005-10-31T10:05:00.000Z	Seveas	dave_	ubuntu uses sudo instead of su
