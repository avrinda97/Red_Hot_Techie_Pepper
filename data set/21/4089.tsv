2008-07-14T19:17:00.000Z	muddler	laughtear	just feel free to ask your question
2008-07-14T19:18:00.000Z	laughtear	muddler	i need to install xp for business reasons onto the other hdd on my computer (internal)
2008-07-14T19:20:00.000Z	laughtear	muddler	but when put the xp cd into the drive, start the installation progress, when the partitioning part starts, f.kin. xp saze that i must use the other hdd on your computer and...
2008-07-14T19:20:00.000Z	laughtear	muddler	... it says you have to change the format of those (linux) partitions..
2008-07-14T19:21:00.000Z	laughtear	muddler	what can i do to install xp sh.t without harming grup an/or ubuntu
2008-07-14T19:21:00.000Z	muddler	laughtear	I haven't looked through this guide but it might take you through step-by-step: http://apcmag.com/how_to_dual_boot_linux_and_windows_xp_linux_installed_first.htm
2008-07-14T19:23:00.000Z	laughtear	muddler	thanks a lot; unop: windows does not accept the hdd i choose for it, and insist on doing something to the hdd which grub is on.
2008-07-14T19:23:00.000Z	muddler	laughtear	windows is stubborn, it may well overwrite grub requiring you to rewrite grub to your mbr
2008-07-14T19:24:00.000Z	muddler	laughtear	you could just let windows do it's stuff and then sort the mbr with a linux live cd afterwards
2008-07-14T19:24:00.000Z	laughtear	muddler	i know, it even may wipe the whoe hdd
2008-07-14T19:25:00.000Z	muddler	laughtear	Page 4 of that guide suggests that it will mark your linux partition as inactive, that's all, but be careful that it does install to a different partition
2008-07-14T19:29:00.000Z	muddler	laughtear	might it be that windows requires a master rather than slave to boot from or something peculiar like that, and your linux drive is the only one of such?
2008-07-14T19:29:00.000Z	laughtear	muddler	probably my linux drive is the master...
2008-07-14T19:29:00.000Z	muddler	laughtear	what I'm getting at is that switching jumpers on the hard drives may help you install to the other drive, and you can always change them back
2008-07-14T19:30:00.000Z	laughtear	muddler	can i use the ultimate boot disk to swap it from there?
2008-07-14T19:31:00.000Z	muddler	laughtear	dunno, I'd have thought it would either be set by hardware jumpers or maybe bios, but it's just a guess if it's not even showing your second HD
2008-07-14T19:32:00.000Z	laughtear	muddler	ok, i'll try, hope to see you guys... and unop
2008-07-14T19:32:00.000Z	muddler	laughtear	just some ideas, I'm no expert so don't do anything you can't undo easily!
2008-07-14T19:33:00.000Z	muddler	laughtear	and a less-dangerous way is to run xp under virtualbox or such if that suits your needs
