After a while an error dialog came up saying  "Error while setting new disklabel."  After Gparted failed I went into the terminal and did some fdisking. I first formatted the entire thing, but that failed saying "The partition table has been altered!

2008-10-22T04:05:00.000Z	LjL	sanado	the floodbot was being serious
2008-10-22T04:12:00.000Z	LjL	sanado	chances are that the drive is faulty, which the fact it took several minutes before it gave you an error strongly hints to (as well as the fact that it stopped working in windows)
2008-10-22T04:13:00.000Z	sanado	LjL	and there'd probably be no way of getting around that then?
2008-10-22T04:13:00.000Z	LjL	sanado	if the damage was on the part of the drive that holds the partition table, unlikely
2008-10-22T04:14:00.000Z	sanado	LjL	that's probably the case, it's a shame too, it was one of those GBA flash cards
2008-10-22T04:14:00.000Z	LjL	sanado	is there currently any important data on it?
2008-10-22T04:16:00.000Z	sanado	LjL	no, no important data, However, one interesting thing is that the manager for the GBA does boot up, leading me to believe that the "OS" of the card is on an entirely different physcal part.
2008-10-22T04:16:00.000Z	LjL	sanado	that's possibly, i've really no idea how the GBA would manage its stuff...
2008-10-22T04:16:00.000Z	LjL	sanado	if you do what genii said, though, you'll also lose that
2008-10-22T04:18:00.000Z	sanado	LjL	That is assuming that the "OS" is on that same physical drive. My theory is that I can't even read the section that contains the OS, It's a rather simple OS.
2008-10-22T04:19:00.000Z	LjL	sanado	the GBA OS itself is most likely in the internal ROM
