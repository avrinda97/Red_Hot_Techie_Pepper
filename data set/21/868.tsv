2012-01-30T15:43:00.000Z	lupzz	jrib	gv is not on that list
2012-01-30T15:43:00.000Z	lupzz	jrib	gv something.eps works ..
2012-01-30T15:43:00.000Z	jrib	lupzz	you can add to the list
2012-01-30T15:43:00.000Z	lupzz	jrib	how?
2012-01-30T15:44:00.000Z	jrib	lupzz	"show other applications" though it used to just let you navigate your filesystem and choose any binary...
2012-01-30T15:45:00.000Z	lupzz	jrib	yes but that option is not there anymore..
2012-01-30T15:45:00.000Z	jrib	lupzz	is gv not listed when you click "show other applications"?
2012-01-30T15:46:00.000Z	lupzz	jrib	is not there
2012-01-30T15:47:00.000Z	jrib	lupzz	create a .desktop file and edit either defaults.list or mimeapps.list (I think it's now mimeapps.list) in ~/.local/share/applications/
2012-01-30T15:50:00.000Z	lupzz	jrib	.. is it this the only way=
2012-01-30T15:54:00.000Z	jrib	lupzz	only way I know
2012-01-30T15:54:00.000Z	lupzz	jrib	ok.. is this a bug or a feature of the gnome 3.x ?
2012-01-30T15:55:00.000Z	jrib	lupzz	what would the bug be?
2012-01-30T15:55:00.000Z	lupzz	jrib	missing custom command in the open with dialog?
2012-01-30T15:56:00.000Z	lupzz	jrib	I can't classify it as a feature request given the fact that this feature was right there in the previous version..
2012-01-30T15:56:00.000Z	jrib	lupzz	my guess would be that it was replaced with the simpler "show other applications" intentionally.  But check launchpad and the gnome bugzilla I guess
2012-01-30T15:57:00.000Z	lupzz	jrib	but what rationale could be in removing the "add custom command" button?
2012-01-30T15:58:00.000Z	jrib	lupzz	I don't know, I didn't do it :P It's more straightforward I guess (I think it's a stupid change)
2012-01-30T16:00:00.000Z	lupzz	jrib	OK
2012-01-30T16:00:00.000Z	lupzz	jrib	if someone else thinks that this should be solved file a bug on this too, I will vote it
