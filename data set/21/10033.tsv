2005-09-02T10:00:00.000Z	sorush20		is there a fit to one page option in Ubuntu open office..
2005-09-02T10:00:00.000Z	nickrud	sorush20	yes, for spreadsheets at least.
2005-09-02T10:01:00.000Z	sorush20	nickrud	can it be for word too...
2005-12-08T14:42:00.000Z	nickrud	sorush20	doing sudo update-rc.d hotplug defaults should be sufficient
2005-12-08T14:43:00.000Z	sorush20	nickrud	I just typed that in but there is no use really..
2005-12-08T14:43:00.000Z	sorush20	nickrud	I keep getting the message that hotplug already exsists ..
2005-12-08T14:44:00.000Z	nickrud	sorush20	then it should be starting on bootup; I have a link S40hotplug in /etc/rcS.d/
2005-12-29T07:36:00.000Z	nickrud	sorush20	no, you cannot force programs to use gtk2 instead of gtk1
2006-01-12T15:41:00.000Z	nickrud	sorush20	unless you want to write it
2006-01-12T16:04:00.000Z	sorush20	nickrud	yes i mean an animation like linspire
2006-01-12T16:05:00.000Z	nickrud	sorush20	? I got lost in the chatter
2006-01-12T16:21:00.000Z	nickrud	sorush20	that qt package is very old; you need to find something that depends on a qt package that is more recent
2006-01-12T16:22:00.000Z	sorush20	nickrud	the new .deb package for linux skype2 needs that?
2006-01-12T16:22:00.000Z	nickrud	sorush20	that's a package from Debian; take a look at what seveas has
2006-01-12T16:25:00.000Z	sorush20	nickrud	the Seveas repositories
2006-01-13T06:31:00.000Z	nickrud	sorush20	then what's the advantage of gentoo (soo offtopic)
2006-01-13T07:23:00.000Z	nickrud	sorush20	there's a fortuitous four, right now :)
2006-04-24T05:47:00.000Z	nickrud	sorush20	some
2006-04-24T05:48:00.000Z	nickrud	sorush20	depends on if the beta amarok will run with the kde libs in breezy. I don't use kde, so I don't know myself
2006-05-21T06:31:00.000Z	nickrud	sorush20	how'd you use hotplug for that <curiosity, mostly>
2006-05-21T06:35:00.000Z	nickrud	sorush20	that's the general idea: you'd put that script into /etc/init.d, and then run sudo update-rc.d defaults NN . NN probably should be <19, since cups is 19
