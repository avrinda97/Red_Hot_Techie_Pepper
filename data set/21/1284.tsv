2010-11-15T02:55:00.000Z	ultimaxtreme		Could I get some help with my Ubuntu Lucid?
2010-11-15T02:55:00.000Z	ultimaxtreme		I can't get KDE on my Session list
2010-11-15T02:56:00.000Z	ultimaxtreme		... I dunno. I don't remember having to install it manually before
2010-11-15T02:57:00.000Z	ultimaxtreme		no
2010-11-15T02:57:00.000Z	ultimaxtreme		I installed Ubuntu 10.04 a few months ago on an old Pentium 4 and it had GNOME and KDE pre-installed
2010-11-15T02:58:00.000Z	ultimaxtreme		I install it on this new AMD computer, and only GNOME is there
2010-11-15T02:59:00.000Z	ultimaxtreme		Well, first, which is better?
2010-11-15T03:00:00.000Z	ultimaxtreme		Then found it was out of support
2010-11-15T03:01:00.000Z	ultimaxtreme		So I got my brother to burn me Ubuntu 10.04, and installed it. So, i assume upgrade
2010-11-15T03:01:00.000Z	coz_	ultimaxtreme	  i would clean install that but its up to you
2010-11-15T03:01:00.000Z	coz_	ultimaxtreme	 and did you ask which was better kde or gnome?
2010-11-15T03:02:00.000Z	ultimaxtreme	coz_	yes
2010-11-15T03:02:00.000Z	coz_	ultimaxtreme	 on older systems  gnome
2010-11-15T03:02:00.000Z	coz_	ultimaxtreme	 kde can be somewhat of a resource hog on older systems
2010-11-15T03:02:00.000Z	ultimaxtreme		Not mie
2010-11-15T03:02:00.000Z	coz_	ultimaxtreme	 and if you want to choose you can also download and burn the  minimal install cd   12 megs
2010-11-15T03:02:00.000Z	ultimaxtreme		I got an AMD Athlon 2.8GHz X4
2010-11-15T03:03:00.000Z	coz_	ultimaxtreme	   https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
2010-11-15T03:03:00.000Z	coz_	ultimaxtreme	 that is not a live cd  but at one point you get a list of things you can install..ubuntu desktop,,,kubuntu desktop  edubuntu desktop etc etc ec ,,arrows scroll the list  and space bar ticks the box
2010-11-15T03:03:00.000Z	ultimaxtreme		I think I'll just get the kubuntu package added with this one
2010-11-15T03:04:00.000Z	coz_	ultimaxtreme	 sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop should do the trick then
