2008-04-27T02:57:00.000Z	CJS3141	amazen720	How about more details? How are you trying to mount it?
2008-04-27T02:59:00.000Z	CJS3141	amazen720	Sorry, can't help you with that. Maybe someone else can...
2008-04-27T03:00:00.000Z	CJS3141	amazen720	I assume you can open it fine in Vista? Do all of your other CDs open OK in ubuntu?
2008-04-27T03:06:00.000Z	amazen720	CJS3141	my ubuntu 8.04 installation disk works
2008-04-27T03:08:00.000Z	CJS3141	amazen720	Did you mention what it was you burned to disk in Vista? I didn't catch that... was it data/sound/video or what?
2008-04-27T03:09:00.000Z	amazen720	CJS3141	burned to disk in vista yes, and it's data
2008-04-27T03:11:00.000Z	CJS3141	amazen720	Wait a minute--isn't UDF the filesystem for DVD disks? Is your disk CD or DVD?
2008-04-27T03:11:00.000Z	amazen720	CJS3141	CD
2008-04-27T03:14:00.000Z	CJS3141	amazen720	Are you able to read any older CDs in Ubuntu that have the UDF filesystem? I'm wondering if it has something to do with Vista using the latest UDF standard, because Mac OS X has some problems with it, so maybe Ubuntu does too.
2008-04-27T03:18:00.000Z	CJS3141	amazen720	That's understandable! :) But to get more clues as possible, try as many other CDs as you can to see if it is just a problem with the Vista written disk.
2008-04-27T03:18:00.000Z	amazen720	CJS3141	okay
2008-04-27T03:21:00.000Z	amazen720	CJS3141	give me a second, I'm burning another disk with magicISO after RAR the files. I have to go in closet to get some old disk, I usual use I Ipod to transfer files
2008-04-27T03:25:00.000Z	amazen720	CJS3141	I found a old CD I burned using XP, to put LINKSYS drivers on it, and it mounted fine
2008-04-27T03:26:00.000Z	amazen720	CJS3141	then you're right it's Vista
2008-04-27T03:26:00.000Z	amazen720	CJS3141	them Microsoft Bastards!!!!!
2008-04-27T03:27:00.000Z	amazen720	CJS3141	their sound be a fix for this soon, right?
2008-04-27T03:27:00.000Z	CJS3141	amazen720	Interesting, yes maybe it's a vista issue. You may have to post/search the ubuntuforums.org to see if there is any info that will help you.
2008-04-27T03:28:00.000Z	amazen720	CJS3141	will do
