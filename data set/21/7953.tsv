2007-04-10T07:43:00.000Z	oldude67		good morning
2007-04-10T07:44:00.000Z	oldude67		is this a good room to ask stupid questions cause im like real new to linux..???
2007-04-10T07:45:00.000Z	oldude67		where is a good place to find out how to install and run programs?
2007-04-10T07:45:00.000Z	oldude67		no i mean like limewire, aim messenger,things like that?
2007-04-10T07:46:00.000Z	jrib	oldude67	I'd recommend gtk-gnutella or frostwire over limewire, but:
2007-04-10T07:47:00.000Z	jrib	oldude67	in general, you'll find that the repository has everything you want or good alternatives for windows programs you are used to
2007-04-10T07:48:00.000Z	jrib	oldude67	run what?
2007-04-10T07:49:00.000Z	jrib	oldude67	figure what out?
2007-04-10T07:50:00.000Z	jrib	oldude67	for aim, you can use gaim or kopete
2007-04-10T07:54:00.000Z	jrib	oldude67	we like to keep #ubuntu just for support since it gets kind of busy.  To chat about other stuff we use #ubuntu-offtopic
2007-04-10T07:56:00.000Z	jrib	oldude67	you should try both and use the one you like better
2007-04-10T08:03:00.000Z	jrib	oldude67	it's an archive, similar to zip on windows, but tar isn't compressed.  help.ubuntu.com is a good intro to Ubuntu
2007-04-10T08:34:00.000Z	jrib	oldude67	tldp.org is pretty good.  But if you are new, I'd suggest getting some Ubuntu-specific stuff first
2007-04-10T08:38:00.000Z	jrib	oldude67	why did you decide not to go with frostwire?  It's the same thing as limewire but a lot easier to install
2007-04-10T08:46:00.000Z	jrib	oldude67	you need to address people you are talking to or your messages will get lost
2007-04-10T08:49:00.000Z	jrib	oldude67	GUI just means "graphical user interface"
2007-04-10T08:57:00.000Z	jrib	oldude67	you can install gtk-gnutella using synaptic
2007-04-10T08:59:00.000Z	jrib	oldude67	you use synaptic.  You'll find almost everything you want in Synaptic after enabling the Universe repository.  If something isn't there, then there is no general method.  You should search the wiki or forums or ask ehre in that case
2007-04-10T09:00:00.000Z	jrib	oldude67	which part is greek?
2007-04-10T09:02:00.000Z	jrib	oldude67	maybe this will help, take a second to read through it.  It goes though all the ways to install things on Ubuntu: https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/add-applications.html
2007-04-15T08:36:00.000Z	jrib	oldude67	you can ask here
