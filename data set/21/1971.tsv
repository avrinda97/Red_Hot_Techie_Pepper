2011-09-01T02:23:00.000Z	qin	swerf	So what is wrong with running do-release-upgrade in screen session?
2011-09-01T02:28:00.000Z	swerf	qin	a do-release-upgrade => an upgrade from jaunty to lucid is not supported with this tool
2011-09-01T02:30:00.000Z	qin	swerf	You are 9.04, and want to upgrade to where?
2011-09-01T02:30:00.000Z	swerf	qin	 haha, whatever the channel supports...
2011-09-01T02:32:00.000Z	qin	swerf	try to edit /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades and change normal to lts, and see if this helps.
2011-09-01T02:33:00.000Z	qin	swerf	Now do-release-upgrade let you upgrade to 9.10, right?
2011-09-01T02:35:00.000Z	swerf	qin	no new release found
2011-09-01T02:40:00.000Z	qin	swerf	do-release-upgrade --proposed ???
2011-09-01T02:41:00.000Z	swerf	qin	a do-release-upgrade => an upgrade from jaunty to lucid is not supported with this tool
