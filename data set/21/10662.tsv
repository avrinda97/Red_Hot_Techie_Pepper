2005-07-26T08:14:00.000Z	vafnord		i checked top and there are two copies of gdm running
2005-07-26T08:14:00.000Z	vafnord		that seems wrong
2005-07-26T08:16:00.000Z	vafnord		what contest?
2005-07-26T08:18:00.000Z	vafnord		datawolf have you ever seen the Python Challenge?
2005-07-26T08:18:00.000Z	vafnord		maybe something like that would be cool
2005-07-26T08:18:00.000Z	vafnord		making it must have been a lot of work
2005-07-26T08:20:00.000Z	vafnord		can anyone help me troubleshoot an extreme slowness problem?
2005-07-26T08:21:00.000Z	vafnord		i've installed from rpms using alienm

2005-07-26T08:22:00.000Z	Seveas	vafnord	not if you con't give more info...
2005-07-26T08:27:00.000Z	Seveas	vafnord	it's normal that there are 2 copies of it running
2005-07-26T08:27:00.000Z	Seveas	vafnord	do you have the ubuntu-desktop package (or at least grepmap installed)
2005-07-26T08:30:00.000Z	Seveas	vafnord	then don't worry about hotplug taking long, it's a known issue and worked on
2005-07-26T08:31:00.000Z	Seveas	vafnord	ah ok
2005-07-26T08:32:00.000Z	Seveas	vafnord	then what else is slow/what are your computer specs?
2005-07-26T08:32:00.000Z	Seveas	vafnord	how much swap?
2005-07-26T08:34:00.000Z	Seveas	vafnord	can you put the output of 'top -b -n1' on the pastebin please
2005-07-26T08:35:00.000Z	Seveas	vafnord	http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl
