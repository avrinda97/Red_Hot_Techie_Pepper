2009-09-26T12:49:00.000Z	chilli0		Hello , Are there any multiplayer car racing games for ubuntu ? That has lots of players.
2009-09-26T12:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chilli0	 check out the 'linux game tome' web site - it has a huge list of games
2009-11-28T15:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chilli0	 its a log file. there will be changes at the end.
2010-04-03T14:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chilli0	 it could be the versionof mencoder or ffmpeg its using - dosent have faac support
2010-04-11T11:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chilli0	 ive often used a tool called 'streamtuner' for saveing streams.
2010-04-11T11:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chilli0	 check the properties/about info in the player that its playing in.. it should show the stream url. you can then cut/paste into streamtuner or other apps.
2010-04-11T11:59:00.000Z	chilli0	Dr_Willis	nothing..
2010-04-11T12:00:00.000Z	chilli0	Dr_Willis	 I think i found it lol.
2010-05-09T11:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chilli0	 You will need to boot a live cd to change the size of the ubuntu parittions
2010-05-09T11:53:00.000Z	chilli0	Dr_Willis	I am running a live cd.
2010-05-09T11:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chilli0	 install/use gparted. it should let you resize it.  There may be  some quirks if one parittion is a primary and youneed tomove space from it to a extended/logical
2010-05-09T11:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chilli0	 you may need to resize it in steps. I normally just use all primaries
2010-05-09T12:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chilli0	 you have allready resized the windows partition?
2010-05-09T12:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chilli0	 that was quick. You did hit 'apply' in gparted? soit actually did the real work?
2010-05-09T12:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chilli0	 you should be able to resize sda3 to use the unallocated space. UNLESS its in a extended/logical parittion. Perhaps  pastebin the output of 'sudo fdisk -l'
2010-05-09T12:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chilli0	 thats proberly the issue then. You need to somehow resize sda3 , THEN resize the sda5 thats in sda3 (i thinki got that right)
2010-05-09T12:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chilli0	 this is why one makes backups.. befor doing this stuff.
2010-05-09T12:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chilli0	 http://gparted.sourceforge.net/larry/resize/resizing.htm
2010-05-09T12:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chilli0	 part of the issue may be  the 'Partition table entries are not in disk order' message
2010-05-09T12:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chilli0	 yea the live cd may try to auto-use the swap.
2010-05-09T12:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chilli0	 i alwyas turn off the swap  befor i do that sort of stuff
