2010-08-06T21:11:00.000Z	ikonia	_raven_	how much ram ?
2010-08-06T21:11:00.000Z	_raven_	ikonia	>200
2010-08-06T21:12:00.000Z	ikonia	_raven_	exactly how much ram
2010-08-06T21:12:00.000Z	_raven_	ikonia	no <200 i mean
2010-08-06T21:12:00.000Z	ikonia	_raven_	exactly how much
2010-08-06T21:12:00.000Z	_raven_	ikonia	184
2010-08-06T21:13:00.000Z	ikonia	_raven_	how is that ram made up, in terms of sim sizes
2010-08-06T21:13:00.000Z	_raven_	ikonia	no idea...
2010-08-06T21:14:00.000Z	ikonia	_raven_	I can't see that as a valid ram figure
2010-08-06T21:14:00.000Z	ikonia	_raven_	if that's your ram, I'd check out your hardware for a hardware fault as I can't see a way to get that ram ammount
2010-08-06T21:15:00.000Z	_raven_	ikonia	3x 64 mb
2010-08-06T21:15:00.000Z	ikonia	_raven_	that's 192
2010-08-06T21:16:00.000Z	_raven_	ikonia	riight
2010-08-06T21:16:00.000Z	ikonia	_raven_	you said you had 184
2010-08-06T21:16:00.000Z	_raven_	ikonia	it sais 184 but its 3x64
2010-08-06T21:17:00.000Z	ikonia	_raven_	so then there is a hardware error
2010-08-06T21:17:00.000Z	ikonia	_raven_	get that solved
2011-01-29T17:10:00.000Z	ikonia	_raven_	you don't
