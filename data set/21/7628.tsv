2006-09-22T13:12:00.000Z	`m0		hi can someone help me with this mini question..... I have bought Cisco VPN and it asks  me to tell it where the kernel source files are
2006-09-22T13:12:00.000Z	`m0		I cannot find my Kernel source files on my ssystem
2006-09-22T13:13:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	`m0	you will need to install them
2006-09-22T13:14:00.000Z	`m0	TheGateKeeper	doesn't it compile it from defauly, does my installaation come with the source files?>
2006-09-22T13:14:00.000Z	`m0		i thought linux comes with the source files for the kernel, cause Cisco VPN requires the headers of the Kernel source
2006-09-22T13:15:00.000Z	`m0		gaim
2006-09-22T13:15:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	`m0	nope you are using a binary distribution, with ubuntu you have to even install gcc
2006-09-22T13:15:00.000Z	`m0		i need the kernel source files
2006-09-22T13:16:00.000Z	`m0		i am not connected online ;9
2006-09-22T13:16:00.000Z	`m0		:(
2006-09-22T13:16:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper		not 100% sure but I think you need to enable universe & apt-get install kernel-source-2.4.27
2006-09-22T13:17:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	`m0	 not 100% sure but I think you need to enable universe & apt-get install kernel-source-2.4.27
2006-09-22T13:17:00.000Z	`m0		i have 2.6.15-26-386
2006-09-22T13:18:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	`m0	if you do a package search say using konqueor apt;/ you will see what you need
2006-09-22T13:19:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	`m0	might also need to install build-essential depending on what you are doing
2006-09-22T13:19:00.000Z	`m0		yes I need to be connected online
2006-09-22T13:19:00.000Z	`m0		I will do this at home
2006-09-22T13:19:00.000Z	`m0		Thanks guys
2006-09-22T13:20:00.000Z	`m0		Can we configure VPN withought a VPN client :s
2006-09-22T13:20:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	`m0	not sure but there is a VPN howto on the ubuntu wiki
