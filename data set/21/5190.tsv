2008-02-05T22:31:00.000Z	Scunizi		Where are most user installed .sh programs installed?  I'm giving Zimbra desktop a shot and it wants to put the install in /root/zimbra/zdesktop.
2008-02-05T22:32:00.000Z	DRebellion	Scunizi	think of /root as the equivalent of your /home/Scunizi directory... not a good place for applications...
2008-02-05T22:33:00.000Z	Scunizi	DRebellion	installed with sudo so it's going into root.. I would think.. otherwise the directory referance would be /home/foobar
2008-02-05T22:34:00.000Z	DRebellion	Scunizi	does it require root privs?
2008-02-05T22:34:00.000Z	Scunizi	DRebellion	yes
2008-02-05T22:36:00.000Z	Scunizi	DRebellion	should I set zimbra to install in /usr/share?
2008-02-05T22:37:00.000Z	DRebellion	Scunizi	i don't know. It probably wants to be installed in /root for a reason, whether good or bad.
2008-02-05T22:37:00.000Z	Scunizi	DRebellion	ok.. it looks easy enough to uninstall if necessary.. thanks.
2008-02-10T01:37:00.000Z	Scunizi	DRebellion	thanks. maybe I should have installed the gnome version?  there are two in synaptic.
2008-02-10T01:37:00.000Z	DRebellion	Scunizi	if you look up routeplanner with << apt-cache show routeplanner >> it has a field "Suggests: routeplanner-gnome". This should have displayed somewhere when you installed the package.
2008-02-10T01:38:00.000Z	Scunizi	DRebellion	it didn't but thanks.. I'll reload the gnome version.
2008-02-10T01:41:00.000Z	DRebellion	Scunizi	python program
2008-02-10T01:42:00.000Z	Scunizi	DRebellion	It's routeplanner.. still can't get it running even after installing -gnome version.. no icon and I'm not sure what to use at the command line to start it.
2008-02-10T01:42:00.000Z	DRebellion	Scunizi	so its not in the applications menu>
2008-02-10T01:42:00.000Z	Scunizi	DRebellion	no.
2008-02-10T01:43:00.000Z	DRebellion	Scunizi	open up a terminal and type,  locate routeplanner | xargs file | grep -i exec
2008-02-10T01:43:00.000Z	DRebellion	Scunizi	actually, you'll have to update the database first with   sudo updatedb
2008-02-10T01:44:00.000Z	Scunizi	DRebellion	already did that.. your line shows 3 executibles.
2008-02-10T01:44:00.000Z	DRebellion	Scunizi	and is routeplanner one of them?
2008-02-10T01:45:00.000Z	Scunizi	DRebellion	all three mention routeplanner then .postinst and .prerm and .postrm as the suffix on routeplanner.
2008-02-10T01:47:00.000Z	Scunizi	DRebellion	nickrud's line shows different results.. rplan and rpcli.  these are also located in /usr/bin instead of /var/lib/dpkg......etc.
