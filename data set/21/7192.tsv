2007-03-11T15:30:00.000Z	PirateHead		I can't import photos from my camera unless I'm root, but the fact that the import wizard comes up anyway makes me think that this is a bug -- does anybody have ideas as to a fix?
2007-03-11T15:30:00.000Z	nekr0z	PirateHead	I do.
2007-03-11T15:31:00.000Z	PirateHead	nekr0z	lay it on me. :-)
2007-03-11T15:31:00.000Z	nekr0z	PirateHead	go to console, plug the camera in and do "lsusb", then look if your camera is detected.
2007-03-11T15:33:00.000Z	PirateHead	nekr0z	lsusb reports my camera and my three empty ports
2007-03-11T15:35:00.000Z	nekr0z	PirateHead	Now look in /etc/udev/rules.d/45-libgphoto2.rules for a line that contains both those hexadecimal numbers.
2007-03-11T15:35:00.000Z	nekr0z	PirateHead	There actually must be 2 lines in that file for each camera.
2007-03-11T15:37:00.000Z	PirateHead	nekr0z	very nice, let me take a look at that
2007-03-11T15:39:00.000Z	PirateHead	nekr0z	still there? it appears that there is no entry for my camera, but I'm not sure
2007-03-11T15:40:00.000Z	nekr0z	PirateHead	Yes, exactly. Well, you have to add it manually. Just make 2 lines looking the same as others, only with your camera's numbers.
2007-03-11T15:40:00.000Z	PirateHead	nekr0z	why 2 lines?
2007-03-11T15:41:00.000Z	nekr0z	PirateHead	Then restart udev (sudo /etc/init.d/udev restart) and replug the camera.
2007-03-11T15:41:00.000Z	PirateHead	nekr0z	it seems that all the other cameras have only 1 line.
2007-03-11T15:41:00.000Z	nekr0z	PirateHead	They have 2 lines each on my system, but if one is enough on yours, you can try it this way.
2007-03-11T15:42:00.000Z	PirateHead	nekr0z	on your system, is it one line right after another?
2007-03-11T15:42:00.000Z	nekr0z	PirateHead	Yes, it is. Report in if the solution works, because there's one more bug on this, and I'll guide you through that fix as well.
2007-03-11T15:46:00.000Z	PirateHead	nekr0z	worked perfectly.
2007-03-11T15:47:00.000Z	nekr0z	PirateHead	Then you got my congratulations! Just be aware, there is one more issue on this, and it can emerge on your system after some update.
2007-03-11T15:48:00.000Z	nekr0z	PirateHead	I filed a bug on launchpad, https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libgphoto2/+bug/91250 -- you may check it out to be prepared.
2007-03-11T15:48:00.000Z	nekr0z	PirateHead	The solution is also there.
2007-03-11T16:02:00.000Z	PirateHead	nekr0z	thanks a bunch for the fix info, hope the launchpad bug gets resolved.
