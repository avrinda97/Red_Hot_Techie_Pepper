2006-04-05T07:32:00.000Z	ipfw		Any Ubuntu developers in here ?
2006-04-05T07:32:00.000Z	ipfw		I just saw, IBM certs DB2 for Unbuntu, next thing you know Ubuntu shifts gears, to roll out a Commercial Distro -- Oh joy
2006-04-05T07:33:00.000Z	__mikem	ipfw	thats what red hat did, they betrayed open source software
2006-04-05T07:33:00.000Z	ipfw	__mikem	 exactly, just what we need, another _commercial_ distro
2006-04-05T07:34:00.000Z	ipfw	__mikem	 yep
2006-04-05T07:35:00.000Z	ipfw	__mikem	 all goes back to deb & slack, still the only two distro's not to sell out
2006-04-05T07:35:00.000Z	ipfw	__mikem	 guess debian doesn't have to, Ubuntu did it for them :P
2006-04-05T07:35:00.000Z	__mikem	ipfw	you got to admit, ubuntu is such a good distro being so stable, its hard to believe its free
2006-04-05T07:36:00.000Z	ipfw	__mikem	 it does have some nice default config && such, but I can build an LFS (linux from scratch), thats rock solid
2006-04-05T07:37:00.000Z	__mikem	ipfw	yup but why complicate things
2006-04-05T07:38:00.000Z	ipfw	__mikem	 Oh, I forgot Gentoo, its original, and not a sellout ... Can't leave it out
2006-04-05T07:40:00.000Z	ipfw	__mikem	 funny, all the *BSD, aren't taking on this "seperate desktop/server release" stuff .. I honestly think its dumb... To me the appeal of Linux is that it can do both
2006-04-05T07:41:00.000Z	ipfw	__mikem	 yeah... _right_ now, but they are making the split, from what I just read
2006-04-05T07:42:00.000Z	__mikem	ipfw	Id like to see for myself
2006-04-05T07:43:00.000Z	__mikem	ipfw	just because a comercial distro is based on ubuntu doen't mean ubuntu itself sold out
2006-04-05T07:43:00.000Z	ipfw	__mikem	 its not _based_ on Ubuntu, its "the same team", as in -- its their new primary focus
2006-04-05T07:44:00.000Z	ipfw	__mikem	 I saw that, and I don't even know what a SimplyMepis is :P
2006-04-05T07:45:00.000Z	ipfw	__mikem	 Oracle is trying to make MySQL fold also, they just *Aquired* sleeplycat's Berkly-DB, that drives _most_ databases (MySQL)
2006-04-05T07:45:00.000Z	ipfw	__mikem	 so Oracle no controls the _backbone_ of MySQL (got them by the balls)
2006-04-05T07:45:00.000Z	ipfw	__mikem	 they did that after MySQL refused to sell for 4Mil
2006-04-05T07:47:00.000Z	ipfw	__mikem	 In a way, I do see a certain amount of that happening ... I guess we should go to Offtopic Chan, according to ubotu
