2007-07-22T13:39:00.000Z	aelliott	seo1	i would personally either just have a single root partition scheme or use LVM - creating pre-sized partitions for your mount points can be really annoying further down the line
2007-07-22T13:40:00.000Z	aelliott	seo1	its logical volume manager.  It allows you to divide a disk up into partitions virtually so that the partitions can be resized on demand

2007-07-22T13:41:00.000Z	aelliott	seo1	 LVM is difficult to implement, but if you really want to seperate your mount points it is the best way
2007-07-22T13:42:00.000Z	aelliott	seo1	 i would personally just have a default ubuntu install with a single / and the file system as simple directories though
2007-07-22T13:45:00.000Z	aelliott	seo1	not very easily, the LVM system has to all be mounted together
2007-07-22T13:46:00.000Z	aelliott	seo1	its certainly not good for sharing partitions between distros
2007-07-22T13:46:00.000Z	aelliott	seo1	in fact most distros wont be able to read the LVM drives at all unless they have the driver module loaded
2007-07-22T13:48:00.000Z	aelliott	seo1	yes, thats what its there for - its ideal if you know you will be buying more hard disks in the future
2007-07-22T13:49:00.000Z	aelliott	seo1	 for example i have a 250gb disk now.  If I bought two more 250gb disks and added them to LVM, it would see one single 750gb disk - I could partition it into chunks as I wanted
2007-07-22T13:49:00.000Z	aelliott	seo1	the only downside is that it is more complicated than a standard filesystem, theres a bit of a learning curve
2007-07-22T13:50:00.000Z	aelliott	seo1	redhat and Fedora Core come with LVM set up as standard, ubuntu can be installed with it using the "alternative install disk"
2007-07-22T13:51:00.000Z	aelliott	seo1	no ext3 is formatted on top of the LVM logical drives
