2008-08-10T05:57:00.000Z	mercutio22		Shoot. I got a serious problem.
2008-08-10T05:58:00.000Z	goodbyegravity_	mercutio22	Between hitting enter and GNOME loading?
2008-08-10T05:58:00.000Z	mercutio22		I suspect something is halting the gnome startup
2008-08-10T05:58:00.000Z	mercutio22	goodbyegravity_	yep
2008-08-10T05:59:00.000Z	mercutio22	goodbyegravity_	If I create a new user, login takes half the time!
2008-08-10T05:59:00.000Z	goodbyegravity_	mercutio22	I think you can view the startup logs with the GNOMe "System Log" app, but I'm not sure which one to look at
2008-08-10T06:00:00.000Z	mercutio22	goodbyegravity_	me neither. Anyonelse out there has a clue?
2008-08-10T06:00:00.000Z	goodbyegravity_	mercutio22	The right log will have timestamps and be able to tell you exactly how much time stuff is taking
2008-08-10T06:00:00.000Z	mercutio22		hmm
2008-08-10T06:00:00.000Z	goodbyegravity_		Let me poke around and see if I can find it
2008-08-10T06:00:00.000Z	mercutio22		lemme dig
2008-08-10T06:02:00.000Z	mercutio22	goodbyegravity_	I don't have bluetooth and I see in a log its trying to load bluetooth modules
2008-08-10T06:03:00.000Z	mercutio22	goodbyegravity_	can I remove them somehow?
2008-08-10T06:03:00.000Z	goodbyegravity_	mercutio22	You can turn off the Bluetooth service under GNOME
2008-08-10T06:03:00.000Z	mercutio22	goodbyegravity_	how do I do that?
2008-08-10T06:03:00.000Z	mercutio22	goodbyegravity_	gconf-editor?
2008-08-10T06:03:00.000Z	goodbyegravity_	mercutio22	Settings --> Administration --> Services
2008-08-10T06:03:00.000Z	mercutio22	goodbyegravity_	thanks
2008-08-10T06:04:00.000Z	goodbyegravity_	mercutio22	And perhaps turn that off.  And then there is a file that Linux reads that tells it what modules to load at run-time.  I don't remember the name, though.
2008-08-10T06:04:00.000Z	goodbyegravity_		It may be modules.conf
2008-08-10T06:04:00.000Z	mercutio22	goodbyegravity_	alright, thanks doode
