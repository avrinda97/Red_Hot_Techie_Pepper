2008-12-06T05:11:00.000Z	magic_ninja		anyone have a good howto on a minimal install?
2008-12-06T05:11:00.000Z	magic_ninja		i'm currently on the live cd
2008-12-06T05:12:00.000Z	mgolisch	magic_ninja	use alternate cd select minimal installation ?
2008-12-06T05:13:00.000Z	magic_ninja	mgolisch	not an option now, i'm currently looking for something that will configure my fstab
2008-12-06T05:15:00.000Z	magic_ninja		so fstab hast o be manually configured?
2008-12-06T05:15:00.000Z	mgolisch	magic_ninja	whats your goal?
2008-12-06T05:16:00.000Z	mgolisch		i dont think the desktop cd supports a base installation, you could apt-get debootstrap and install a minimal base system using that, but that will require manualy partitioning, formating mounting and final configuration of the installed base system by hand
2008-12-06T05:17:00.000Z	magic_ninja	mgolisch	and hischild: right now i'm on the live cd from a usb stick, and i'm not new to linux by any means, but i want to do a minimal install and just install what i need, running into some hickups on configuring my fstab from this live boot, is there a utility i can run to configure my fstab or will I now have to do it manually
2008-12-06T05:17:00.000Z	mgolisch	magic_ninja	so what did you allready do?
2008-12-06T05:18:00.000Z	mgolisch		did you install a base system allready?
2008-12-06T05:18:00.000Z	mgolisch		or what
2008-12-06T05:18:00.000Z	magic_ninja	mgolisch	i already have the base system installed using debootstrap and i'm in the process of configuring fstab atm, the purpose of this is to learn
2008-12-06T05:18:00.000Z	mgolisch	magic_ninja	no idea if there is a tool i allways did it by hand
2008-12-06T05:19:00.000Z	mgolisch		worked well on my eeepc
2008-12-06T05:19:00.000Z	mgolisch		i had to go the debootstrap way because of the lack of usb cd or dvd drive
2008-12-06T05:20:00.000Z	magic_ninja	mgolisch	so can i give you a copy of my fdisk -l and pastebin this up for you guys to check it out?
