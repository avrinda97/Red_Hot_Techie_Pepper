2005-10-23T14:48:00.000Z	NanoBCN		hi people
2005-10-23T14:48:00.000Z	NanoBCN		I'm experiencing a weird behavior with my laptop battery
2005-10-23T14:48:00.000Z	NanoBCN		Don't know if it broke or since I installed breezy it doesn't recharge it
2005-10-23T14:49:00.000Z	NanoBCN		anyone else with problems with batteries in laptops?
2005-10-23T14:50:00.000Z	synthetic_fenix	NanoBCN	my battery lasts longer under Ubuntu then it does under Windows :-)
2005-10-23T14:50:00.000Z	NanoBCN	synthetic_fenix	yes, but that's not my problen. It used to work perfectly under hoary
2005-10-23T14:50:00.000Z	NanoBCN	synthetic_fenix	now it just work if plugged
2005-10-23T14:50:00.000Z	synthetic_fenix	NanoBCN	what kind of laptop is it?
2005-10-23T14:51:00.000Z	NanoBCN	synthetic_fenix	it's a Medion, which has much un common with Acer laptops
2005-10-23T14:51:00.000Z	synthetic_fenix	NanoBCN	did you upgrade to Breezy or do a fresh install?
2005-10-23T14:51:00.000Z	synthetic_fenix	NanoBCN	thats seems kinda odd
2005-10-23T14:52:00.000Z	NanoBCN	synthetic_fenix	it is
2005-10-23T14:52:00.000Z	NanoBCN	synthetic_fenix	I'll try with a hoary live cd, to see if it's a matter of OS
2005-10-23T14:52:00.000Z	synthetic_fenix	NanoBCN	maybe recompile the kernel add in battery saving features, kinda sounds like its not allowing the processor to underclock if its drainign your battery fast
2005-10-23T14:53:00.000Z	NanoBCN	synthetic_fenix	never compiled a kernel :(
2005-10-23T14:53:00.000Z	NanoBCN	synthetic_fenix	I was trying to avoid that
2005-10-23T14:53:00.000Z	synthetic_fenix	NanoBCN	eeeep
2005-10-23T14:54:00.000Z	synthetic_fenix	NanoBCN	and compiling a kernel isnt exactly easy, umm your running gnome or kde?
2005-10-23T14:54:00.000Z	NanoBCN	synthetic_fenix	gnome
2005-10-23T14:58:00.000Z	synthetic_fenix	NanoBCN	check your channel lists I'm trying to chat with you in dcc
2005-10-23T15:07:00.000Z	NanoBCN	synthetic_fenix	sorry, dude, I didn't see your msn
