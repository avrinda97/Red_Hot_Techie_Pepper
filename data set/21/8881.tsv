2005-12-25T16:44:00.000Z	dooglus	Travis_	you can use your private key instead of a password - that saves a lot of messing about with password prompts
2005-12-25T16:45:00.000Z	Travis_	dooglus	but lots of users would be logging in
2005-12-25T16:45:00.000Z	Travis_		so that wouldn't work
2005-12-25T16:45:00.000Z	Travis_		keys won't work
2005-12-25T16:45:00.000Z	Travis_		so theres not like a modified version of the ssh client that lets me specifiy it in the command like user:password@host
2005-12-25T16:45:00.000Z	dooglus	Travis_	so what's the point of the exercise?  you want to prompt for a password and pass it on to ssh?  why not just let ssh prompt for a password instead?
2005-12-25T16:46:00.000Z	Travis_	dooglus	I am using a gui interface todo it
2005-12-25T16:46:00.000Z	dooglus	Travis_	if you specify the password on the command line, everyone on the system can see the password when they run "ps"
2005-12-25T16:46:00.000Z	Travis_	dooglus	thats fine with me
2005-12-25T16:46:00.000Z	Travis_		since no one is gonna actually be logged into the machine
2005-12-25T16:47:00.000Z	dooglus	Travis_	if you don't mind everyone seeing the password, you may as well not use passwords.  leave all the passwords empty - then you won't need to propmt for them.
2005-12-25T16:47:00.000Z	Travis_		no they need to be passworded
2005-12-25T16:47:00.000Z	Travis_		but the actuall accounts are set to goto /bin/false or whatever
2005-12-25T16:47:00.000Z	dooglus	Travis_	with insecure passwords?  why?
2005-12-25T16:47:00.000Z	Travis_		so no one is actually logged into the computer
2005-12-25T16:47:00.000Z	Travis_		ok
2005-12-25T16:49:00.000Z	Travis_		basically, I am setting up a Mac OS X computer for a school the school uses SSH with pGina for auth on the windows boxes, so I need a away to make a shell script to authenticate to  the server with the users on, with a gui interface, if the authentication is a success it continues on to the OS X login
2005-12-25T16:51:00.000Z	Travis_		tried LDAP SSH works much better
2005-12-25T16:51:00.000Z	Travis_		hmmm
2005-12-25T16:51:00.000Z	Travis_		so theres no way to send text to program thats running in terminal
2005-12-25T16:51:00.000Z	dooglus	Travis_	look at "expect"
