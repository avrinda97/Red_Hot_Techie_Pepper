2008-08-22T11:24:00.000Z	chrismurf		"sudo kill -9 1025" won't kill totem (1025 is the pid)
2008-08-22T11:25:00.000Z	chrismurf		any magic suggestions?
2008-08-22T11:25:00.000Z	chrismurf		totem is consuming 100% CPU and I can't kill it (the window is gone)
2008-08-22T11:26:00.000Z	chrismurf		I've tried sending it a variety of signals
2008-08-22T11:26:00.000Z	chrismurf		can't
2008-08-22T11:26:00.000Z	chrismurf		working on my thesis
2008-08-22T11:26:00.000Z	chrismurf		rebooting would be...undesirable
2008-08-22T11:26:00.000Z	chrismurf		anyway I can foreground it?
2008-08-22T11:26:00.000Z	chrismurf		zombie it remotely?
2008-08-22T11:26:00.000Z	chrismurf		I don't understand how this is even possible
2008-08-22T11:27:00.000Z	neil_d	chrismurf	have you tried 'kill -9 <number>'
2008-08-22T11:27:00.000Z	chrismurf	neil_d	yes, thanks
2008-08-22T11:28:00.000Z	neil_d	chrismurf	have you tried logging out ?
2008-08-22T11:29:00.000Z	neil_d	chrismurf	have you tried logging out ?
2008-08-22T11:30:00.000Z	chrismurf	neil_d	I'd really rather not, because I have many thesis-related windows open.  Plus, this is linux, I shouldn't have to, right? ;-)
2008-08-22T11:32:00.000Z	neil_d	chrismurf	not generally but a runaway process is another story.   maybe you could just 'renice' it with htop or something so it does slow your system down.
2008-08-22T11:32:00.000Z	chrismurf	neil_d	now that's the kind of creative thinking I need :-)
2008-08-22T11:33:00.000Z	chrismurf	neil_d	still @ 100%, but I suspect that'll make my laptop more usable, thanks for the thought
2008-08-22T11:33:00.000Z	chrismurf	neil_d	back to work ;-)
2008-08-22T11:34:00.000Z	neil_d	chrismurf	did that help ?
2008-08-22T11:34:00.000Z	chrismurf	neil_d	my laptop is more responsive, but the process is still pegged at 100% (I have a dual core)
