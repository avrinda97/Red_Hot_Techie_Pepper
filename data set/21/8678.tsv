2006-08-01T16:12:00.000Z	arto		Are there any internet recourses that give recommendation about the best linux/ubuntu hardware compatibility/configuration that would best keep my linux system stable and well configured? I mean, if there is not, then there should be. Instead of all the hassle people waste in configuring drivers.
2006-08-01T16:13:00.000Z	Half-Left	arto	no best, Linux has the best hardware detection out of the box than any OS
2006-08-01T16:14:00.000Z	arto	Half-Left	I believe that the main hardware detection problem is mostly in graphic cards detection. At least people should be aware which one/model is best.
2006-08-01T16:14:00.000Z	arto	Half-Left	And also sound-cards detection.. somehow.
2006-08-01T16:15:00.000Z	arto	Half-Left	Besides, how can you backup what you're saying? :P
2006-08-01T16:15:00.000Z	Half-Left	arto	I can back it up because it's a fact, and the kernel devs say it
2006-08-01T16:16:00.000Z	arto	Half-Left	To backup, you must compare it let's say to XP?
2006-08-01T16:16:00.000Z	Half-Left	arto	XP is 5 years old
2006-08-01T16:17:00.000Z	arto	Half-Left	SP1, SP2.. make some difference, but if I am not quite wrong.. have you ever had hardware configuration problems with XP?
2006-08-01T16:17:00.000Z	Half-Left	arto	it doesnot support Nforce out of the box, ethernet, sound and I have that
2006-08-01T16:18:00.000Z	Half-Left	arto	also VIA chipsets with full agp support and many othe
2006-08-01T16:19:00.000Z	arto	Half-Left	I got you now. But there is still another point.. It's more important to configure a hardware perfectly with an external (disk,CD) driver than just putting generic configuration into a kernel, which will reduce its performance. Or what?
2006-08-01T16:19:00.000Z	Half-Left	arto	Service packs add some drivers, but you still need a disk for most of your drives in XP
2006-08-01T16:20:00.000Z	Half-Left	arto	The Linux kernel detects hardware on boot, unlike XP
2006-08-01T16:21:00.000Z	Half-Left	arto	try changing you motherboard chipset in XP, you'll get a BSOD, Linux kernel detects on boot
2006-08-01T16:21:00.000Z	arto	Half-Left	did you read my previous message? The hardware detection in any kernel, would have general drivers that are not customized for specific hardware, and therefore wouldn't give the same quality as an external cd.
2006-08-01T16:22:00.000Z	Half-Left	arto	not, your hardware is detected on boot, ie. if you have a nForce chipset it will load the proper modules
2006-08-01T16:23:00.000Z	arto	Half-Left	I understand this, but I don't think there is a list of modules for every piece of hardware. They are rather general modules, not perfectly customized. Get it? Correct me if I am wrong.
2006-08-01T16:24:00.000Z	Half-Left	arto	Like I said, Linux has the best "out of the box" support for harware than ANY OS
2006-08-01T16:24:00.000Z	arto	Half-Left	You don't seem to understand english. Anyway, nevermind.
2006-08-01T16:25:00.000Z	Half-Left	arto	XP dont even have usb 2.0 support out of the box
