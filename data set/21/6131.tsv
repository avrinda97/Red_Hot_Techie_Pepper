2007-05-29T07:23:00.000Z	reevester		guys does 7.04 have an installation issue on old PC's ?
2007-05-29T07:23:00.000Z	reevester		miine doesnt install at all....its tooo damn slow
2007-05-29T07:24:00.000Z	CheshireViking	reevester	what sort of age are you talking about? how much memory & what processor?
2007-05-29T07:24:00.000Z	reevester		P3 550 MHz 128MB RAM
2007-05-29T07:25:00.000Z	reevester		<<<CheshireViking>>> its a P3 550 MHZ 128 MB ram 20 gig HDD
2007-05-29T07:25:00.000Z	CheshireViking	reevester	looks like it might be the ram thats causing the problem, I have a laptop with similar ram, it does install, but is quite slow, I'm going to try xubuntu on it to see how that compares
2007-05-29T07:26:00.000Z	reevester		well in my case the installation doesnt even start...it doesnt recognise my serial Mouse and at the menu that pops up (where I have to enter a username) i dont know what to do
2007-05-29T07:26:00.000Z	reevester		it just keeps resetting the countdown timer
2007-05-29T07:26:00.000Z	CheshireViking	reevester	i didn't have that problem, but i installed from the alternate cd
2007-05-29T07:27:00.000Z	reevester		whats the difference between te alternate cd and the general version ?
2007-05-29T07:27:00.000Z	reevester		does the alternate cd contain the same stuff as the general disc with the GUI and stuff?
2007-05-29T07:28:00.000Z	reevester		is it easy to install via the alternate disc?
2007-05-29T07:28:00.000Z	CheshireViking	reevester	guidelines suggest minimum ram for feisty is 256Mb
2007-05-29T07:29:00.000Z	reevester	CheshireViking	>> yes i just read that......
2007-05-29T07:29:00.000Z	reevester		:(
2007-05-29T07:29:00.000Z	reevester		is it easy to install via the alternate disc???
2007-05-29T07:30:00.000Z	CheshireViking	reevester	yes it pretty easy, its just a text based installer rather than the graphical one on the livecd
2007-05-29T07:31:00.000Z	reevester		do i have to know any commands to use the alternate CD or is it pretty straightforward?
2007-05-29T07:32:00.000Z	reevester		hmmm ok...then ill give the alternate CD a whirl :)
2007-05-29T07:32:00.000Z	reevester		also whats the difference between v7.xx and v6.xx ???? i heard 6 is more stable.........?
