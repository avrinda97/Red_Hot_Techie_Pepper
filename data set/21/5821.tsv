2007-07-30T16:53:00.000Z	Calymos		Do I need to use sudo to move files in there?
2007-07-30T16:53:00.000Z	Calymos		the firmware place?
2007-07-30T16:54:00.000Z	Happu	Calymos	yes
2007-07-30T16:54:00.000Z	Calymos		What would I type for that?
2007-07-30T16:55:00.000Z	Happu	Calymos	did you install the new driver already?
2007-07-30T16:55:00.000Z	Calymos		No, I can't do anything yet; still on windows. I need to reboot to linux, but then I can't get online
2007-07-30T16:55:00.000Z	Calymos		only one computer, see...
2007-07-30T16:56:00.000Z	Happu	Calymos	too bad :/ Well I can't help much futher because I don't know anything about the module you are going to install, if it's even a module
2007-07-30T16:57:00.000Z	Calymos	Happu	Would it help if I sent you the link I got the driver at?
2007-07-30T16:59:00.000Z	Happu	Calymos	let's try :)
2007-07-30T16:59:00.000Z	Calymos	Happu	http://sourceforge.net/projects/zd1211/ Here's the link.
2007-07-30T05:00:00.000Z	Happu	Calymos	wait a second
2007-07-30T05:01:00.000Z	Happu	Calymos	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=92327&highlight=ZD1211
2007-07-30T05:01:00.000Z	Happu	Calymos	you should print that page
2007-07-30T05:02:00.000Z	Happu	Calymos	there is also encryption guide
2007-07-30T05:03:00.000Z	Calymos	Happu	Encryption guide? To close off my connection to others, or get into it?
2007-07-30T05:04:00.000Z	Calymos	Happu	So it is in fact a module?
2007-07-30T05:04:00.000Z	Happu	Calymos	to close your connection. You don't have to use it if you don't want. It's in the part 3 of the guide. If you don't have printer be sure you can acces that guide from your linux (save it to disk or something like that)
2007-07-30T05:04:00.000Z	Happu	Calymos	yes, it's an driver module
2007-07-30T05:04:00.000Z	Calymos	Happu	Thanks for the help, it means quite a bit to me.
2007-07-30T05:04:00.000Z	Happu	Calymos	I have been there :) No problem and good luck
