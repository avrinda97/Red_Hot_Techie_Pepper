2007-08-11T07:49:00.000Z	yadah		Yo, say I want to use ubuntu for server use, which is better to use the LTS one or the latest stable build? (Feisty Fawn)
2007-08-11T07:50:00.000Z	dystopianray	yadah	what sort of server?
2007-08-11T07:50:00.000Z	yadah	dystopianray	Well web server, IRC server, male
2007-08-11T07:50:00.000Z	dystopianray	yadah	if it's some sort of mission critical production server, then LTS is likely your best bet
2007-08-11T07:51:00.000Z	dystopianray	yadah	probably becuase the majority of people don't need them
2007-08-11T07:54:00.000Z	dystopianray	yadah	yes that's right, the majority do not compile anything
2007-08-11T07:54:00.000Z	yadah	dystopianray	oh please.
2007-08-11T07:59:00.000Z	dystopianray	yadah	firefox should be the latest version, 2.0.0.6
2007-08-11T07:59:00.000Z	dystopianray	yadah	i've had that version for about a week
2007-08-11T08:00:00.000Z	dystopianray	yadah	i've had firefox 2.0.0.6 since august 1
2007-08-11T08:02:00.000Z	dystopianray	yadah	it won't update to the latest kernel version, it will update within kernel 2.6.20.x
2007-08-11T08:03:00.000Z	dystopianray	yadah	each ubuntu version has a different kernel version
2007-08-11T08:03:00.000Z	dystopianray	yadah	6.06 has 2.6.17 i believe
2007-08-11T08:04:00.000Z	dystopianray	yadah	7.10 will have 2.6.22
2007-08-11T08:04:00.000Z	yadah	dystopianray	:/
2007-08-11T08:05:00.000Z	yadah	dystopianray	so how can I garuntee maximum security with dapper drake without the latest kernel
2007-08-11T08:05:00.000Z	dystopianray	yadah	you don't need the latest kernel for maximum security
2007-08-11T08:06:00.000Z	dystopianray	yadah	security fixes are backported to older kernel releases
2007-08-11T08:11:00.000Z	dystopianray	yadah	newer apps can be obtained from backports
2007-08-11T08:12:00.000Z	dystopianray	yadah	I think it's gutsy+1
