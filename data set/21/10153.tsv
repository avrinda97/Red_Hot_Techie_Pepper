2005-06-23T09:57:00.000Z	chombee		is that a hardware problem?
2005-06-23T09:57:00.000Z	paulproteus	chombee	Means your CD is probably bad.
2005-06-23T09:57:00.000Z	chombee	paulproteus	- or the cdrom or the USB connection more likely. The cd was used fine to install on another machine
2005-06-23T09:58:00.000Z	chombee	paulproteus	- could I have mounted it with the wrong fs? I guess not cause I am able to browse the mounted volume
2005-06-23T09:58:00.000Z	paulproteus	chombee	No, this is a lower-level problem than picking the wrong filesystem.
2005-06-23T09:58:00.000Z	chombee	paulproteus	- the USB connection is dodgy
2005-06-23T09:59:00.000Z	paulproteus	chombee	Oh, I see.
2005-06-23T10:00:00.000Z	paulproteus	chombee	Yeah.  It's times like that I just take the hard drive out and install it on something else.
2005-06-23T10:00:00.000Z	paulproteus	chombee	Or be *really careful* with the USB.
2005-06-23T10:00:00.000Z	paulproteus	chombee	You may find it easier to do a "server" install rather than a full one from the CD.
2005-06-23T10:00:00.000Z	chombee	paulproteus	- that's whay I did! I did a server install, and ended up with the HD back in and no way to get packages
2005-06-23T10:00:00.000Z	paulproteus	chombee	I see.
2005-06-23T10:01:00.000Z	paulproteus	chombee	You didn't happen to copy the CD contents to that hard drive, did you?
2005-06-23T10:01:00.000Z	chombee	paulproteus	- I put the HD in another machine and did server install, but once I put the HD back I have no network and no cdrom
2005-06-23T10:01:00.000Z	chombee	paulproteus	- explain ?
2005-06-23T10:02:00.000Z	paulproteus	chombee	Maybe we should work on getting the wifi to work, so you can get yourself up from there.  What card is it?
2005-06-23T10:03:00.000Z	chombee	paulproteus	- no cd contents at that location. The wireless card is unsupported, may work with ndiswrapper - but I can't download it! Anyway - it's a LinkSys Wireless-G WPC54G
2005-06-23T10:04:00.000Z	chombee	paulproteus	- maybe I should put the HD in the other laptop again, download ndiswrapper or whatever might be useful, then put the HD back
2005-06-23T10:04:00.000Z	paulproteus	chombee	Agreed.  But you'll want to do research to also get the Windows drivers for the laptop so ndiswrapper can do its thing.
2005-06-23T10:05:00.000Z	chombee	paulproteus	- okay. I rest now
2005-06-23T10:05:00.000Z	paulproteus	chombee	Understandable.
