2007-01-10T12:13:00.000Z	ubuntu-l1nux	gaubong	I have a new computer Core 2 Duo + Intel DP965LT motherboard. But I cannot use ubuntu Live CD with it.
2007-01-10T12:14:00.000Z	gaubong	ubuntu-l1nux	What happen when you start with the cd?
2007-01-10T12:15:00.000Z	ubuntu-l1nux	gaubong	it fails to recognize devices, even cannot mount the cd-driver with live cd inside
2007-01-10T12:16:00.000Z	gaubong	ubuntu-l1nux	So it cannot start into GNOME yet?
2007-01-10T12:16:00.000Z	gaubong	ubuntu-l1nux	What is your cdrom model?
2007-01-10T12:16:00.000Z	ubuntu-l1nux	gaubong	No. It cannot.
2007-01-10T12:17:00.000Z	ubuntu-l1nux	gaubong	It is a sony DVD-writer.
2007-01-10T12:17:00.000Z	ubuntu-l1nux	gaubong	I think it is a kernel problem.
2007-01-10T12:17:00.000Z	gaubong	ubuntu-l1nux	internal or external?
2007-01-10T12:17:00.000Z	ubuntu-l1nux	gaubong	Internal
2007-01-10T12:17:00.000Z	gaubong	ubuntu-l1nux	Weird
2007-01-10T12:17:00.000Z	gaubong	ubuntu-l1nux	There often is no problem with internal CD drive
2007-01-10T12:18:00.000Z	gaubong	ubuntu-l1nux	Have you tried to check the md5 of the iso file you downloaded?
2007-01-10T12:19:00.000Z	ubuntu-l1nux	gaubong	yep. I also used older ubuntu versions, Hoary, Breezy, Dapper that I recieved by post.
2007-01-10T12:19:00.000Z	gaubong	ubuntu-l1nux	You may want to try another distro live cd
2007-01-10T12:20:00.000Z	gaubong	ubuntu-l1nux	If the problem is the same, then that may be a kernel problem.
2007-01-10T12:21:00.000Z	ubuntu-l1nux	gaubong	After using ubuntu for a long time, it is difficult to migrate back to those rpm distros.
2007-01-10T12:21:00.000Z	ubuntu-l1nux	gaubong	But I can test
2007-01-10T12:21:00.000Z	ubuntu-l1nux	gaubong	Thanks anyway.
2007-01-10T12:21:00.000Z	gaubong	ubuntu-l1nux	No, just want to make sure that is not the problem of ubuntu.
