2008-06-24T01:01:00.000Z	joaopinto		it's passwd -d :P
2008-06-24T01:01:00.000Z	joaopinto		tripps, passwd -d will delete the user's passwd and disable the account
2008-06-24T01:01:00.000Z	joaopinto		ops, was for tritan
2008-06-24T01:03:00.000Z	ASULutzy	joaopinto	tritan: passwd -l should work, check the man page
2008-06-24T01:03:00.000Z	joaopinto	ASULutzy	he was complaining about having a password :P
2008-06-24T01:04:00.000Z	ASULutzy	joaopinto	heh, well, I guess not having a password and having a password that isn't possible to enter aren't exactly the same thing ;)
2008-07-01T02:25:00.000Z	joaopinto	ASULutzy	he is trying to do an Ubuntu native install from an installed Mandrake, since he is unable to boot from the Ubuntu CD
2008-07-01T02:26:00.000Z	ASULutzy	joaopinto	mattiniraq: Yikes. Um. Noone else out there has a USB stick you could borrow? You could make a bootable live-usb
2008-07-01T22:47:00.000Z	joaopinto	ASULutzy	savage is native for linux.. not wine
2008-07-02T00:02:00.000Z	joaopinto	ASULutzy	lsb_release -a
2008-07-02T00:02:00.000Z	ASULutzy	joaopinto	Thanks
2008-07-02T00:57:00.000Z	joaopinto	ASULutzy	not that it will help...
2008-07-07T19:41:00.000Z	joaopinto	ASULutzy	hum ? envyng installs a different driver version, the recommended install is the default driver provided from the hardware drivers menu
2008-07-07T19:42:00.000Z	ASULutzy	joaopinto	Well, that driver isn't working for him, so I figured let Envy have a go?
2008-07-07T19:42:00.000Z	joaopinto	ASULutzy	sure, but your comment "Envy does a better job at installing the fglrx drivers" is a out of context
2008-07-07T19:42:00.000Z	ASULutzy	joaopinto	Ah, you're right, sorry trying to figure out why my Windows VM is hosed beyond belief.
2008-07-07T19:46:00.000Z	joaopinto	ASULutzy	you are not expected to need sudo to rm a dir inside your home dir :)
2008-07-07T19:47:00.000Z	ASULutzy	joaopinto	Agreed, but he just said that rm -rf ~/.wine/ didn't work, so my assumption was something in there is owned by root
2008-07-07T19:48:00.000Z	joaopinto	ASULutzy	he didn't said the command said, it just said not all the soft was uninstall, which maybe a different matter, like .desktop files not being removed
2008-07-07T21:07:00.000Z	joaopinto	ASULutzy	wubi should run slow also because it runs over an ntfs driver, and not raw I/O like it does with a real FS
2008-07-07T21:08:00.000Z	ASULutzy	joaopinto	Hmmm, yea that's true. Still, the overhead shouldn't be that huge (ie I wouldn't expect a native install to run 100% faster)
