2004-11-12T17:51:00.000Z	|trey|	MeAndU	k
2004-11-12T17:52:00.000Z	MeAndU	|trey|	did not find smbuseradd, is this one same /usr/sbin/mksmbpasswd
2004-11-12T17:53:00.000Z	|trey|	MeAndU	dpkg -l samba
2004-11-12T17:53:00.000Z	|trey|	MeAndU	not part of sambaclient
2004-11-12T17:55:00.000Z	MeAndU	|trey|	If you mean samba package it is installed i can see my ubuntu machine from windows networking
2004-11-12T17:55:00.000Z	|trey|	MeAndU	that means didly... smbclient is installed, thats why you can see it..
2004-11-12T06:04:00.000Z	|trey|	MeAndU	smbadduser  is the command... like I said, it ought to be in samba
2004-11-12T06:08:00.000Z	MeAndU	|trey|	smbadduser command not found and i have samba installed ?
2004-11-12T06:08:00.000Z	|trey|	MeAndU	I dunno what to tell you man... are you root? if not, why not? if you still don't see it... time to search google  :/
2004-11-12T06:09:00.000Z	MeAndU	|trey|	I have searched installed files of samba package for smbadduser, nothing
2004-11-12T06:10:00.000Z	MeAndU	|trey|	I am root yes
2004-11-12T06:11:00.000Z	|trey|	MeAndU	blah, man smbpasswd ...
2004-11-12T06:18:00.000Z	MeAndU	|trey|	Thanks a lot, smbpasswd -a ubuntu32 did the trick
2004-11-12T06:18:00.000Z	|trey|	MeAndU	sorry @ the attitude... I told you smbadduser and 'google search' for a reason though  :/
