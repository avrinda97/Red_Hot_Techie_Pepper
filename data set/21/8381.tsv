2006-07-04T05:44:00.000Z	livingdaylight		Is there any specific way dvd witers need to be configured that i should know about?
2006-07-04T05:44:00.000Z	livingdaylight		k3b says it can write, but i've tried to burn dvd .iso and yet it says it is blank
2006-07-04T05:45:00.000Z	hyphenated	livingdaylight	after going into the menu and choosing Tools -> Burn DVD ISO Image ?
2006-07-04T05:47:00.000Z	hyphenated	livingdaylight	have you previously gone to Settings -> K3b Setup ?
2006-07-04T05:47:00.000Z	livingdaylight	hyphenated	yea, did that and burnt the iso ; but it shows up as empty  - i'm trying again now
2006-07-04T05:48:00.000Z	livingdaylight	hyphenated	went to Settings -> configure k3b , and under device it confirms that it has picked up the new dvd writer i just bought
2006-07-04T05:49:00.000Z	hyphenated	livingdaylight	the other one (K3b setup) checks/changes permissions of a bunch of things if they are set incorrectly
2006-07-04T05:49:00.000Z	livingdaylight		what am i looking for?
2006-07-04T05:55:00.000Z	livingdaylight	hyphenated	in k3b setup ; how should things be?
2006-07-04T05:56:00.000Z	livingdaylight	hyphenated	?
2006-07-04T05:56:00.000Z	hyphenated	livingdaylight	it should load up stuff about 'Settings', 'Devices' and 'External Programs'
2006-07-04T05:57:00.000Z	livingdaylight	hyphenated	yea..no, how should they be setup?
2006-07-04T05:57:00.000Z	livingdaylight	hyphenated	its there; but  i dont know if it is right or wrong
2006-07-04T05:57:00.000Z	livingdaylight	hyphenated	k3b again burnt a blank dvd
2006-07-04T05:57:00.000Z	hyphenated	livingdaylight	it's showing you 'how things should be'. is "Apply" clickable or disabled?
2006-07-04T05:58:00.000Z	livingdaylight	hyphenated	its disabled
2006-07-04T05:59:00.000Z	livingdaylight	hyphenated	un-clickable
2006-07-04T05:59:00.000Z	hyphenated		so it does a complete burn with no errors, and it still appears blank to you when it's done?
2006-07-04T06:00:00.000Z	livingdaylight	hyphenated	thats about it
2006-07-04T06:00:00.000Z	hyphenated	livingdaylight	I'd use google to find out if other people have complained about that drive in linux
2006-07-04T06:00:00.000Z	livingdaylight	hyphenated	ok, a project for tomorrow then
