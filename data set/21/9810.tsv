2008-07-16T03:39:00.000Z	zeeeee		i'm trying to get online via wireless, i can "iwlist scan", but i can't seem to get a connection after entering "iwconfig wlan0 essid blah" - any hints?
2008-07-16T03:39:00.000Z	bobbyd_	zeeeee	got a GUI?
2008-07-16T03:40:00.000Z	bobbyd_	zeeeee	if so, use NetworkManager
2008-07-16T03:40:00.000Z	zeeeee	bobbyd_	i have kubuntu
2008-07-16T03:40:00.000Z	zeeeee	bobbyd_	can i still use network manager?
2008-07-16T03:40:00.000Z	bobbyd_	zeeeee	Yep
2008-07-16T03:40:00.000Z	bobbyd_	zeeeee	it should come by default, if not, just install it
2008-07-16T03:41:00.000Z	zeeeee	bobbyd_	i can't install it because i have no internet :)
2008-07-16T03:41:00.000Z	bobbyd_	zeeeee	to do it from the command line, you need to make sure the interface is up "ifconfig <interface> up" then get an ip address "dhclient <interface>"
2008-07-16T03:42:00.000Z	zeeeee	bobbyd_	that's the thing, i can't get an ip address via dhclient
2008-07-16T03:43:00.000Z	bobbyd_	zeeeee	are you sure you've got the right interface?
2008-07-16T03:43:00.000Z	zeeeee	bobbyd_	i think so.  i just see lo, eth0, wmaster0, and wlan0
2008-07-16T03:43:00.000Z	zeeeee	bobbyd_	i've been working with wlan0
2008-07-16T03:44:00.000Z	zeeeee	bobbyd_	that's the only one with wireless interface
2008-07-16T03:44:00.000Z	bobbyd_	zeeeee	plug in a cable?
2008-07-16T03:45:00.000Z	zeeeee	bobbyd_	hah
2008-07-16T03:45:00.000Z	zeeeee	bobbyd_	so i guess no more ideas
2008-07-16T03:46:00.000Z	bobbyd_	zeeeee	check you're in the right mode (managed) and that you have the right essid, encryption mode, encryption key, channel etc.
2008-07-16T03:49:00.000Z	zeeeee	bobbyd_	i'm in the right mode, there's no encryption
2008-07-16T03:49:00.000Z	zeeeee	bobbyd_	not sure how to check about the channel and stuff
2008-07-16T03:50:00.000Z	bobbyd_	zeeeee	dunno, it should just work out of the box, connect a cable and install network manager :)
