2008-06-23T00:15:00.000Z	starbucks	WalloO	Alright thanks...:)
2008-06-23T00:15:00.000Z	starbucks	WalloO	 Do you know any good games I should try please for Linux?
2008-06-23T00:42:00.000Z	WalloO	starbucks	do you have a nvidia card?
2008-06-23T00:43:00.000Z	starbucks	WalloO	Yes
2008-06-23T00:44:00.000Z	WalloO	starbucks	it seems there are problems these days with nvidia. Maybe setting it by hand in xorg.conf can help
2008-06-23T00:47:00.000Z	starbucks	WalloO	How would I do that please?
2008-06-23T00:47:00.000Z	WalloO	starbucks	do you use single or dual screen?
2008-06-23T00:50:00.000Z	starbucks	WalloO	Single
2008-06-23T00:51:00.000Z	WalloO	starbucks	I can provide you a Xorg.conf where you will just have to replace 1024x768 with your own size. But keep a copy of your old one just in case
2008-06-23T00:53:00.000Z	starbucks	WalloO	Alright thanks
2008-06-23T00:53:00.000Z	WalloO	starbucks	http://watermark.tuxfamily.org/xorg.conf this xorg.conf file has tv output enable, but it may not be an issue
2008-06-23T00:53:00.000Z	starbucks	WalloO	What do I do with it?
2008-06-23T00:54:00.000Z	starbucks	WalloO	Where do I put it?
2008-06-23T00:54:00.000Z	WalloO	starbucks	you can replace yours (keep a copy of the current one just in case something goes wrong). Use my sorg.conf which is simple, and juste change all 1024x768 with the size you want for your screen
2008-06-23T00:55:00.000Z	WalloO	starbucks	it is in /etc/X11. But copy your current /etc/X11/xorg.conf before. to be sure to be able to restore it in case it doesn't work the way you want
