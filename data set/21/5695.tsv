2007-10-24T03:30:00.000Z	Evanlec		i dont understand then
2007-10-24T03:31:00.000Z	Evanlec		they only run on patched version of 2.6.23?
2007-10-24T03:32:00.000Z	Evanlec		anyone here using a RT2500 based wifi card?
2007-10-24T03:33:00.000Z	void^	Evanlec	rt2500pci works fine.
2007-10-24T03:34:00.000Z	Evanlec	void^	i know it does on ubuntu kernel, but im having trouble compiling the module for my custom kernel
2007-10-24T03:34:00.000Z	void^	Evanlec	might have problems compiling the module on 2.6.23 until they update the code
2007-10-24T03:34:00.000Z	Evanlec	void^	really? what should i do then?
2007-10-24T03:35:00.000Z	void^	Evanlec	if you don't want to fix it yourself and can't find a patch somewhere you will have to wait/use an older kernel version
2007-10-24T03:35:00.000Z	Evanlec	void^	im following this guide, http://rt2x00.serialmonkey.com/wiki/index.php?title=Rt2400_Installation_Guide
2007-10-24T03:37:00.000Z	Evanlec	void^	this is the error im getting trying to install the module, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41865/
2007-10-24T03:38:00.000Z	Evanlec	void^	same error i get when i try running make on my 2.6.23 kernel
2007-10-24T03:38:00.000Z	void^	Evanlec	uh, you are using the old rt2500 driver there. i suppose it hasn't been officially adapted for .22 even.
2007-10-24T03:39:00.000Z	Evanlec	void^	oh...wheres the new driver? use the one from ralink site?
2007-10-24T03:39:00.000Z	void^	Evanlec	no, the non-legacy driver from that page. either a cvs snapshot or git code.
2007-10-24T03:40:00.000Z	void^	Evanlec	that's the new driver which is default in gutsy.
2007-10-24T03:41:00.000Z	Evanlec	void^	oh, do i want the rt2x00-cvs-daily.tar.gz ?
2007-10-24T03:41:00.000Z	void^	Evanlec	yes, but it's quite likely not going to work with .23 either
2007-10-24T03:41:00.000Z	Evanlec	void^	bahhh, why not?
2007-10-24T03:41:00.000Z	void^	Evanlec	like i said above
2007-11-07T14:30:00.000Z	void^	Evanlec	depends on the window manager - on fluxbox it switches to the 4th workspace ;)
2007-11-07T14:31:00.000Z	void^	Evanlec	no, but fluxbox, on whatever happens to run on the computer in front of me :-)
