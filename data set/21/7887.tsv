2006-12-24T17:07:00.000Z	Flannel	madman91	wine is in universe
2006-12-24T17:09:00.000Z	madman91	Flannel	i cant find it .. i have universe
2006-12-24T17:09:00.000Z	Flannel	madman91	then you don't really have universe.
2006-12-24T17:09:00.000Z	Flannel	madman91	have you updated your cache since adding it?
2006-12-24T17:12:00.000Z	Flannel	madman91	you're missing a newline around line 15
2006-12-24T17:14:00.000Z	madman91	Flannel	is that causing any problems?
2007-01-28T06:45:00.000Z	Flannel	madman91	C++, python, lots of stuff.
2007-01-28T06:45:00.000Z	Flannel	madman91	C too, yes.
2007-04-16T07:58:00.000Z	Flannel	madman91	#ubuntu+1 for FEisty support
2007-07-25T08:18:00.000Z	Flannel	madman91	Of course youll still need to enter your GPG password
2007-07-25T08:19:00.000Z	madman91	Flannel	thats fine
2007-07-25T09:16:00.000Z	Flannel	madman91	you could change the UUID, but you can't set it to anything.  It'll change if you reformat (or maybe it's repartition, I don't remember)
2007-07-25T09:16:00.000Z	madman91	Flannel	hm.. what about the TAG?
2007-07-25T09:17:00.000Z	madman91	Flannel	sorry.. LABEL
2007-07-25T09:23:00.000Z	madman91	Flannel	i guess you can change uuid's
2007-07-25T09:23:00.000Z	Flannel	madman91	I suppose so.  Sorry about that ;)
2007-07-25T09:23:00.000Z	madman91	Flannel	no problem
2007-08-20T12:38:00.000Z	Flannel	madman91	If you have a weak password, then you can be compromised. (because they can log in as you)
2007-08-20T12:39:00.000Z	madman91	Flannel	unless you disable the password logins
2007-08-20T12:39:00.000Z	Flannel	madman91	right
