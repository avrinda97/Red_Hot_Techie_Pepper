2006-01-13T10:51:00.000Z	alekandr		Anyone know about HT? My amdfx supports it, and im sure i read somewhere, that it needs to be enabled?
2006-01-13T10:51:00.000Z	Blissex	alekandr	it is usually no worth it a lot.
2006-01-13T10:52:00.000Z	alekandr	Blissex	is there no real performance upgrade?
2006-01-13T10:52:00.000Z	Blissex	alekandr	in part because multiple threads means cache interference etc. But if you got the right app it can give around 30%. All you need is an SMP kernel.
2006-01-13T10:52:00.000Z	alekandr	Blissex	I though smp was for duel processor?
2006-01-13T10:53:00.000Z	Blissex	alekandr	HT is a form of dual processor...
2006-01-13T10:56:00.000Z	alekandr	Blissex	any command to check the processor is ht enabled?
2006-01-13T10:57:00.000Z	Blissex	alekandr	no idea. Try 'cat /proc/cpuinfo' and then look up the id string with Google and suitable keywords.
2006-01-13T10:57:00.000Z	alekandr	Blissex	;) tytyty
2006-01-13T10:58:00.000Z	Blissex	alekandr	no, SMP will even work on a single CPU
2006-01-13T10:58:00.000Z	Blissex	alekandr	even if SMP sometimes is a bit less reliable then single processor.
2006-01-13T10:59:00.000Z	Blissex	alekandr	BTW, have your got some spare cash? Because then there is a little upgrade you could try...
2006-01-13T11:00:00.000Z	alekandr	Blissex	yeah... tell me more?
2006-01-13T11:01:00.000Z	Blissex	alekandr	Intel have released a really cheap (relatively) dual core CPU, which is almost half the price of the cheapest AMD X2.
2006-01-13T11:01:00.000Z	Blissex	alekandr	it is the Pentium D 820, and has massive cache etc.
2006-01-13T11:01:00.000Z	alekandr	Blissex	sounds nice :] 
2006-01-13T11:01:00.000Z	Blissex	alekandr	that is a _lot_ better than HT
2006-01-13T11:02:00.000Z	Blissex	alekandr	that surely does not have HT -- only Intel CPUs have HT
2006-01-13T11:02:00.000Z	Blissex	alekandr	you could upgrade to an AMD X2, but they are very expensive. Also, your FX3500 is more or less as good as you can get, huge cache etc.
2006-01-13T11:03:00.000Z	alekandr	Blissex	cheers :] 
2006-01-13T11:19:00.000Z	alekandr	Blissex	quick question: whats the best sound sys to use: ESD, ALSA, Artsd, or OSS?
