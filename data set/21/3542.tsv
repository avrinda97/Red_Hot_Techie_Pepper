2008-11-29T04:42:00.000Z	sysrpl		i am having a problem and need some help please. i am trying to play a video on ibex with totem, andd the video has some external subtitle files which totem doesn't work with (i think). the subtitle files are in vobsub idx and sub foramt. i believe the sub is not actually a textfile (which totem expect?) ... my question is how can i get totem to display the subtitles?
2008-11-29T04:43:00.000Z	sysrpl		anyone?
2008-11-29T04:44:00.000Z	draco1234	sysrpl	I don't know your exact issue, but I know that you can solve a lot of problems by using "vlc" instead of "totem" .. vlc has support for a ton of formats
2008-11-29T04:45:00.000Z	sysrpl	draco1234	well i am having a problem with vlc and subtitles fonts as well
2008-11-29T04:46:00.000Z	sysrpl	draco1234	how can i change the subtile font in vlc? because i changed it to another ttf already and it still looks like the same crappy subtitle font ... i.e. my changing the subtitle font seemed to have no effect
2008-11-29T04:47:00.000Z	draco1234	sysrpl	did you close vlc after saving the setting, and then open it again? sometimes it does not take the settings till you close it and then re-run it
2008-11-29T04:47:00.000Z	sysrpl	draco1234	yes i did
2008-11-29T04:47:00.000Z	sysrpl	draco1234	it uses ttf files
2008-11-29T04:48:00.000Z	draco1234	sysrpl	have you tried that for any other fonts, or just that one?
2008-11-29T04:48:00.000Z	sysrpl	draco1234	i unzipped a few on my hd to change the font ... but where are ttf normall kept in ubutu?
2008-11-29T04:48:00.000Z	sysrpl	draco1234	i only tried arial black which i had to download
2008-11-29T04:48:00.000Z	sysrpl	draco1234	where are the other fonts ttf kept on ubuntu?
2008-11-29T04:50:00.000Z	sysrpl	draco1234	?
2008-11-29T04:50:00.000Z	sysrpl		does anyone know where ttf files are under ubuntu?
2008-11-29T04:51:00.000Z	draco1234	sysrpl	sorry, i was looking... they seem to be in /usr/share/fonts/truetype
2008-11-29T04:51:00.000Z	sysrpl	draco1234	thanks, i'll try with vlc
2008-11-29T04:54:00.000Z	sysrpl		nope, vlc is displaying the same crappy font
2008-11-29T04:54:00.000Z	sysrpl	draco1234	thanks for the attempt
2008-11-29T04:55:00.000Z	draco1234	sysrpl	is it vlc 0.9.4?
2008-11-29T04:56:00.000Z	sysrpl		bbtw, this hasn't hit the news yet, but the recent terrorist attacks inMumbai were baed on a movie with the same plot
2008-11-29T04:57:00.000Z	draco1234	sysrpl	make sure "freetype2" is selected as the text rendering module
