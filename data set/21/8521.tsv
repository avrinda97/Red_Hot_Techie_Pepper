2006-08-31T14:47:00.000Z	Intangir		it offers very few benefits
2006-08-31T14:47:00.000Z	Intangir		and is more trouble than its worth unless your running another OS concurrently
2006-08-31T14:47:00.000Z	sethk	Intangir	it heats up the cpu, which might be good in winter
2006-08-31T14:47:00.000Z	sethk	Intangir	:)
2007-03-19T14:38:00.000Z	sethk	Intangir	yes, there are force flags you can use with dpkg
2007-03-20T08:10:00.000Z	sethk	Intangir	use the smp version of the kernel
2007-03-20T08:10:00.000Z	Intangir	sethk	i dont see an smp version
2007-03-20T08:11:00.000Z	sethk	Intangir	Look at your kernel's config file, see if smp is enabled
2007-03-20T08:11:00.000Z	Intangir	sethk	i see -generic -server -server-bigiron -386
2007-03-20T08:11:00.000Z	sethk	Intangir	I think server is smp, but generic may be also.  I'll have to look.
2007-03-20T08:12:00.000Z	Intangir	sethk	CONFIG_X86_SMP=y
2007-03-20T08:12:00.000Z	Intangir	sethk	CONFIG_SMP=y
2007-03-20T08:12:00.000Z	sethk	Intangir	ok, then you should be seeing it.  let me see if there is a sysctl option for it.
2007-03-20T08:14:00.000Z	sethk	Intangir	I believe gcc is not threaded.
2007-03-20T08:24:00.000Z	Intangir	sethk	i found it, -generic supports SMP, -386 doesnt, it was booting -386 by default ;()
2007-03-20T08:24:00.000Z	sethk	Intangir	ok, now it makes sense.
2007-03-20T08:26:00.000Z	Intangir	sethk	whats PREEMPT mean on my kernel?
2007-03-20T08:26:00.000Z	sethk	Intangir	means that system calls are interruptable
2007-03-20T08:26:00.000Z	Intangir	sethk	is that good? my -generic kernel doesnt have it
2007-03-20T08:26:00.000Z	Intangir	sethk	but my old dapper kernel does
2007-03-20T08:27:00.000Z	sethk	Intangir	preempt reduces latency, and so makes the desktop more responsive.  It has a small cost in performance.
