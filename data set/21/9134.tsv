2005-11-20T09:31:00.000Z	Nihil85	nickrud	yes, it's a part of it
2005-11-20T09:22:00.000Z	Nihil85	nickrud	i have the same cups proble. it says that i'm not allowed to do administrative tasks.
2005-11-20T09:23:00.000Z	Nihil85	nickrud	how can i be part of the lpadmin group?
2005-11-20T09:24:00.000Z	nickrud	Nihil85	type groups in a terminal, it should tell you what groups you are in
2005-11-20T09:25:00.000Z	Nihil85	nickrud	but i still can't enter the administrative task
2005-11-20T09:26:00.000Z	nickrud	Nihil85	did you do sudo adduser cupsys shadow , then sudo /etc/init.d/cupsys restart ?
2005-11-20T09:26:00.000Z	Nihil85	nickrud	no
2005-11-20T09:27:00.000Z	Nihil85	nickrud	the problem remains the same
2005-11-20T09:28:00.000Z	nickrud	Nihil85	do groups in a terminal, see if you're in the lpadmin group
2005-11-20T09:28:00.000Z	Nihil85	nickrud	i've done it a moment ago and i posted here the result: i'm in the lpadmin group
2005-11-20T09:28:00.000Z	nickrud	Nihil85	sorry, thought that was the other guy. A sec, please
2005-11-20T09:30:00.000Z	Nihil85	nickrud	wait, wait! changing the chmod of the cupsys.conf to my group (nihil) i solve the problem!!!
2005-11-20T09:30:00.000Z	nickrud	Nihil85	try groups cupsys, make sure that it's part of the shadow group
2005-11-20T09:30:00.000Z	nickrud	Nihil85	not a good solution
2005-11-20T10:13:00.000Z	Nihil85	nickrud	if you didn't so much, i have another insoluted problem for you!!!!
2005-11-20T10:14:00.000Z	nickrud	Nihil85	I love doing nothing :)
2005-11-20T10:14:00.000Z	Nihil85	nickrud	i want to save you from yourself asking you another question: How can i make a wireless lan between two ubuntu pc?
2005-11-20T10:15:00.000Z	nickrud	Nihil85	ah, networking: I touch that not, no offence.
2005-11-20T10:15:00.000Z	Nihil85	nickrud	i have followed many how-to, guides, people, ecc ecc ecc
2005-11-20T10:15:00.000Z	Nihil85	nickrud	don't worry
2005-11-20T10:15:00.000Z	nickrud	Nihil85	I haven't done near enough of that to be able to even help myself :)
