2008-09-12T15:22:00.000Z	jrib	benjick	yeah, but you should provide a summary here with your link
2008-09-12T15:24:00.000Z	jrib	benjick	that's because flash and pulseaudio don't play nice.  You can install the libflashsupport package to make flash use pulseaudio, but for some people it makes firefox crash
2008-09-12T15:24:00.000Z	benjick	jrib	Yeah, i have to install flash manually. I'm i in a moment 22 then?
2008-09-12T15:25:00.000Z	jrib	benjick	why do you have to install it manually?
2008-09-12T15:25:00.000Z	benjick	jrib	Because libflashsupport makes FF crash
2008-09-12T15:25:00.000Z	jrib	benjick	how does installing it manually help?
2008-09-12T15:26:00.000Z	jrib	benjick	so you don't actually have a problem now?
2008-09-12T15:26:00.000Z	benjick	jrib	The sound problem is still there
2008-09-12T15:26:00.000Z	jrib	benjick	exactly...
2008-09-12T15:27:00.000Z	jrib	benjick	ah, so you've tried libflashsupport in the past and it has crashed for you
2008-09-12T15:29:00.000Z	benjick	jrib	nspluginwrapper is for netscape?
2008-09-12T15:29:00.000Z	jrib	benjick	no
2008-09-12T15:33:00.000Z	benjick	jrib	Thanks slot
2008-09-12T15:35:00.000Z	benjick	jrib	I hope you understand you solved me some months of anger, really; thank you
2008-09-12T15:36:00.000Z	jrib	benjick	well I hope it works for you.  I'm not on 32bit so I don't know if libflashsupport is still a problem or not (and you just haven't experienced it yet)
2008-09-12T15:36:00.000Z	benjick	jrib	Gonna try it out
2008-09-12T15:36:00.000Z	jrib	benjick	sure
2008-09-12T15:40:00.000Z	benjick	jrib	Ah, it was the flashplugin-nonfree package which i couldn't use before. That one made FF crash
