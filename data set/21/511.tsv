2011-11-03T05:52:00.000Z	shawn186		10.10 had the good interface
2011-11-03T05:52:00.000Z	shawn186		i just want that same style
2011-11-03T05:53:00.000Z	robin0800	shawn186	well you can log into gnome classic or gnome classic fallback
2011-11-03T05:54:00.000Z	shawn186		i don't see gnome fallback
2011-11-03T05:54:00.000Z	shawn186		i am only in gnome classic with effects
2011-11-03T05:55:00.000Z	robin0800	shawn186	gnome classic no effects
2011-11-03T05:55:00.000Z	shawn186		i like effects though
2011-11-03T05:56:00.000Z	robin0800	shawn186	gnome classic needs a hack to run compiz
2011-11-03T05:57:00.000Z	shawn186	robin0800	the gnome classic package looks nothing like 10l10
2011-11-03T05:57:00.000Z	shawn186		*10.10
2011-11-03T05:57:00.000Z	shawn186		bull
2011-11-03T05:58:00.000Z	robin0800	shawn186	you can configure it though use alt click
