2008-01-14T19:25:00.000Z	mraudsepp		Hello. How can I get a 64bit kernel to work for an otherwise 32bit system install? I need to chroot into a 64bit system, but 7.10 doesn't seem to have a linux-image-amd64-generic and linux-image-generic gets me booted into a 32bit kernel per uname -m (and inability to chroot to 64bit system)
2008-01-14T19:25:00.000Z	ikonia	mraudsepp	you can't
2008-01-14T19:26:00.000Z	mraudsepp	ikonia	what do you mean I can't? Does it mean I have to build my own kernel?
2008-01-14T19:26:00.000Z	ikonia	mraudsepp	you can't run a 64 bit kernel on a 32bit machine
2008-01-14T19:26:00.000Z	mraudsepp	ikonia	I have a 64bit machine with a 32bit installation of edubuntu...
2008-01-14T19:27:00.000Z	ikonia	mraudsepp	you have a 32bit install - you cannot run 64bit software
2008-01-14T19:27:00.000Z	mraudsepp	ikonia	which is why I want to chroot into a 64bit install.
2008-01-14T19:27:00.000Z	ikonia	mraudsepp	you can't do that
2008-01-14T19:27:00.000Z	ikonia	mraudsepp	as the running kernel will still be 32bit
2008-01-14T19:27:00.000Z	ikonia	mraudsepp	it's not possible
2008-01-14T19:28:00.000Z	mraudsepp	ikonia	it is. I have done it on different distributions and earlier ubuntu versions had a linux-image-amd64-generic package that allowed to do exactly what I'm trying to do successfully for some people per google.
2008-01-14T19:29:00.000Z	ikonia	mraudsepp	your welcome to think what you wish, but with a 32bit kernel running you will not be able to run any 64bit programs
2008-01-14T19:29:00.000Z	mraudsepp	ikonia	my question was precisely HOW can I install a 64bit kernel to my 7.10 edubuntu systme.
2008-01-14T19:29:00.000Z	ikonia	mraudsepp	you can't put a 64bit kernel on a 32bit system wihtout a lot of messing around
2008-01-14T19:30:00.000Z	ikonia	mraudsepp	your miss-reading the description
2008-01-14T19:31:00.000Z	ikonia	mraudsepp	you need to change teh repo's then
2008-01-14T19:31:00.000Z	ikonia	mraudsepp	just be aware that the package manager will not play nicley tyring to install that lot into a chroot
2008-01-14T19:32:00.000Z	mraudsepp	ikonia	I don't want to install anything into a chroot from ubuntu. It will be a different distribution. I just need to be able to chroot into it in the future
2008-01-14T19:32:00.000Z	ikonia	mraudsepp	so you just want a kernel on its own ?
2008-01-14T19:32:00.000Z	ikonia	mraudsepp	thatsit
2008-01-14T19:33:00.000Z	ikonia	mraudsepp	not going to happen
