2009-03-05T06:51:00.000Z	cdm10	danhs	what do you mean by a third party installer?
2009-03-05T06:51:00.000Z	cdm10	danhs	I'm not sure what you mean by a third-party installer...
2009-03-05T06:51:00.000Z	danhs	cdm10	I mean, that I should be able to download random third party software that is for sale (costs money) double click on the application and run it/install it
2009-03-05T06:52:00.000Z	danhs	cdm10	the notion of having *everything* in a repository is anathema to a desktop operating system
2009-03-05T06:52:00.000Z	cdm10	danhs	lots of apps work that way... try Skype, for example.
2009-03-05T06:52:00.000Z	cdm10	danhs	you can click "download for Ubuntu", download the file, and literalyl double-click it.
2009-03-05T06:52:00.000Z	cdm10	danhs	it's just up to the software companies to actually use DEB packages.
2009-03-05T06:53:00.000Z	cdm10	danhs	you CAN, if they supply it for Ubuntu
2009-03-05T06:53:00.000Z	cdm10	danhs	no one's stopping companies from using DEB packages or writing their own installers
2009-03-05T06:53:00.000Z	danhs	cdm10	even open source softwrae that doesn't have a debian or ubuntu package manager *rarely* will upload .deb package
2009-03-05T06:53:00.000Z	cdm10	danhs	...then it's their problem.
2009-03-05T06:53:00.000Z	danhs	cdm10	but that's a little unfair to the companies too.  there's rpm, .deb and there's no binary guarantee that a compiled .deb or rpm will work on more than a single machine!
2009-03-05T06:54:00.000Z	cdm10	danhs	what do you mean? if the system's running Ubuntu, and they supply a DEB package that works on Ubuntu, it'll work on Ubuntu...
2009-03-05T06:54:00.000Z	danhs	cdm10	you're right they *could* build .deb files but those files may not work on debian if they work on ubuntu, or mepis, or insert other distribution here
2009-03-05T06:55:00.000Z	cdm10	danhs	so they can supply Ubuntu-specific ones. Ubuntu and Fedora, for example, may both be Linux, but they're both different operating systems.
2009-03-05T06:55:00.000Z	danhs	cdm10	I suppose so.  But one .deb that worked for ubuntu 8.04 might not work for 8.10
2009-03-05T06:56:00.000Z	danhs	cdm10	my big complaint is that until linux gets this right, we won't ever get applications like dreamweaver or other popular applications
2009-03-05T06:57:00.000Z	danhs	cdm10	and I *have* downloaded and compiled applications.  it's a suck process.  I need to use checkinstall and then make icons in the gnome menu myself
2009-03-05T06:57:00.000Z	cdm10	danhs	I suppose some aspects of what you're saying are true. I'm not sure how it could be fixed, though.
2009-03-05T06:58:00.000Z	danhs	cdm10	I don't know either.  It seems like klik and autopackage are the best options.  But the people with power to change this (people leading ubuntu) don't care to support and evangelize those solutions
