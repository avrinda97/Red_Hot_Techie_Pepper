2007-04-16T06:19:00.000Z	sipior	Mike	try installing the network-manager package. frankly, for better wireless support, you'd be wise to upgrade to ubuntu feisty as it comes out this week
2007-04-16T06:20:00.000Z	sipior	Mike	"ifconfig" will list the current network devices on your system
2007-04-16T06:20:00.000Z	sipior	Mike	you'll be looking for an entry like "eth0" or the like
2007-04-16T06:21:00.000Z	sipior	Mike	then try "iwlist eth0 scanning" with the appropriate substitution and see what happens
2007-04-16T06:24:00.000Z	sipior	Mike	try "iwlist eth1 scan"
2007-04-16T06:27:00.000Z	sipior	Mike	try "ifconfig eth1 up" first, then try scanning again
2007-04-16T06:28:00.000Z	sipior	Mike	sorry "sudo ifconfig eth1 up"
2007-04-16T06:28:00.000Z	sipior	Mike	then type your password when prompted
2007-04-16T06:30:00.000Z	sipior	Mike	but there's no error when you type ifconfig eth1 up? you sure there isn't an ethernet cardon that interface?
2007-04-16T06:30:00.000Z	sipior	Mike	try "sudo ifconfig eth0 up" and then "sudo iwlist eth0 scan" and see what happens
2007-04-16T06:33:00.000Z	sipior	Mike	i'm afraid i see some more googling in your future, friend :) i was serious about upgrading to Feisty by the way, it has better integration with the "network-manager" app, which make wireless a breeze. it comes out later this week, iirc, so if this is a new install, you won't have lost anything...
