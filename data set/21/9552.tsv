2005-10-31T14:28:00.000Z	linuxboy		I just upgraded to breezy. But the 2.6.12 kernel panics. Any ideas?
2005-10-31T14:29:00.000Z	intelikey	linuxboy	yeah i got an idea that you should try that same question with the information on WHAT THE PANIC IS !
2005-10-31T14:31:00.000Z	linuxboy	intelikey	it says something about the filesystem. VFS stuff
2005-10-31T14:32:00.000Z	linuxboy	intelikey	any idea how to fix it?
2005-10-31T14:34:00.000Z	intelikey	linuxboy	if you can list the /boot dir check that /boot/initrd.img points to the new version   ls -l /boot
2005-10-31T14:35:00.000Z	linuxboy	intelikey	/boot/initrd.img doesn't exist
2005-10-31T14:35:00.000Z	intelikey	linuxboy	any initrd* anything in there.
2005-10-31T14:36:00.000Z	linuxboy	intelikey	initrd.img-2.6.10-5-686 initrd.img-2.6.12-9-686 ?
2005-10-31T14:38:00.000Z	linuxboy	intelikey	don't work
2005-10-31T14:39:00.000Z	intelikey	linuxboy	sudo grub-install /dev/hda    <--- assuming ide hard drive there.
2005-10-31T14:39:00.000Z	linuxboy	intelikey	nope
2005-10-31T14:39:00.000Z	linuxboy	intelikey	I found the problem
2005-10-31T14:40:00.000Z	intelikey	linuxboy	share it.
2005-10-31T14:40:00.000Z	linuxboy	intelikey	my /boot was full
2005-10-31T14:43:00.000Z	intelikey	linuxboy	good point, i wasn't working on 'why' i was only working on what to do about it.    thanks for the jolt.   :)
2005-10-31T14:43:00.000Z	linuxboy	intelikey	to fix it, you make free space
2005-10-31T14:48:00.000Z	linuxboy	intelikey	what is the file size of your initrd?
2005-10-31T14:49:00.000Z	intelikey	linuxboy	i'm not using ubuntu nor the 2.6 kernel  ask someone that is.
2005-10-31T14:50:00.000Z	intelikey	linuxboy	it still could be the map file or something in /boot/grub
2005-10-31T14:51:00.000Z	linuxboy	intelikey	what?
2005-10-31T14:51:00.000Z	linuxboy	intelikey	I'm checking that I got the whole file before I reboot :)
