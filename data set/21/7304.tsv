2006-10-26T10:22:00.000Z	cyph1e		Hi, I'm having a Geforce 7900 GS. When I try to install the nvidia-glx drivers and reboot, I can't start X. It says it can't find screen. What shuld I do?
2006-10-26T10:22:00.000Z	sivik	cyph1e	you have to go into xorg.conf and change nv to nvidia
2006-10-26T10:22:00.000Z	cyph1e	sivik	I've already done that
2006-10-26T10:23:00.000Z	sivik	cyph1e	whats the error you get if you try to run startx from tty1
2006-10-26T10:23:00.000Z	cyph1e		hmm I think it said it couldn't find screen, I booted to windows now, I can't view the error logs
2006-10-26T10:24:00.000Z	cyph1e		this is like my 10'th time trying to install the nvidia drivers getting that message
2006-10-26T10:24:00.000Z	sivik		there might be a bug in them
2006-10-26T10:24:00.000Z	sivik		!nvidia
2006-10-26T10:24:00.000Z	cyph1e		That's the guide I used
2006-10-26T10:24:00.000Z	cyph1e		and I've tried with 2 different graphics card (the other was geforce 6600 gt)
2006-10-26T10:25:00.000Z	sivik	cyph1e	let me try and see if i can get my 6600 to work
2006-10-26T10:25:00.000Z	cyph1e		using the guide https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
2006-10-26T10:26:00.000Z	cyph1e		https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
2006-10-26T10:26:00.000Z	cyph1e		that was the one I used
2006-10-26T10:26:00.000Z	sivik	cyph1e	thats the one i'm following, let me see if it works for me
2006-10-26T10:26:00.000Z	cyph1e		I downloaded them using the Synaptic Package Manager
2006-10-26T10:27:00.000Z	sivik	cyph1e	thats cool
2006-10-26T10:27:00.000Z	cyph1e		and then I ran "sudo nvidia-glx-config enable"
2006-10-26T10:27:00.000Z	cyph1e		and after I rebooted, I couldnt load X
2006-10-26T10:27:00.000Z	cyph1e		ok
2006-10-26T10:27:00.000Z	sivik	cyph1e	thats why i was hoping you knew what the error said
