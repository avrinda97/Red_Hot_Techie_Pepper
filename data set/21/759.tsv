2011-06-27T15:53:00.000Z	dkkd_	ikonia	yea i selected dev/sda7 ?
2011-06-27T15:53:00.000Z	ikonia	dkkd_	how did you select that ?
2011-06-27T15:55:00.000Z	dkkd_	ikonia	it gives a list of prepare partitions with change revert and delete buttons
2011-06-27T15:55:00.000Z	ikonia	dkkd_	yes, but that window doesn't normally allow you to set a file system to a partition
2011-06-27T15:57:00.000Z	dkkd_	ikonia	ok so where do you think i am going wrong? the use as option says do not use as partition.
2011-06-27T15:57:00.000Z	ikonia	dkkd_	partition the disk, drop out of advanced mode and set the file systems up properly
2011-06-27T16:00:00.000Z	dkkd_	ikonia	i am one step back now at -- prepare disk space. could i get some direction ?
2011-06-27T16:00:00.000Z	ikonia	dkkd_	in what way direction ?
