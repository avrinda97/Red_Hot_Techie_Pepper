2005-10-25T15:28:00.000Z	daved	spundun_	root (hd0,0)
2005-10-25T15:31:00.000Z	spundun_	daved	then it sayd fs type is fat and not ext2.. I dont know where its getting that
2005-10-25T15:31:00.000Z	spundun_	daved	and then it cant find stage1 on there.. but its there on /dev/hda1.. which is the first partition on /dev/hda
2005-10-25T15:32:00.000Z	spundun_	daved	I am sure I am missing something... but I cant figureout what.
2005-10-25T15:33:00.000Z	daved	spundun_	privmsg me the result of   sudo fdisk -l /dev/hda
2005-10-25T15:39:00.000Z	spundun_	daved	I sent you a lot of text.. did you get it?
2005-10-25T15:39:00.000Z	daved	spundun_	are you seeing my replies?
2005-10-25T15:39:00.000Z	spundun_	daved	no...
2005-10-25T15:39:00.000Z	daved	spundun_	i'm replying to your privmsg
2005-10-25T15:40:00.000Z	spundun_	daved	hmm ... I cant see any of those...
2005-10-25T15:40:00.000Z	daved	spundun_	do you have some weird client that default-ignores privmsg?
2005-10-25T15:40:00.000Z	daved	spundun_	run    setup (hd0)
2005-10-25T15:41:00.000Z	spundun_	daved	same result with setup (hd0)
2005-10-25T15:41:00.000Z	daved	spundun_	what kind of weird install are you doing that you have to run grub by hand?
2005-10-25T15:42:00.000Z	spundun_	daved	do have an easier solution?
2005-10-25T15:42:00.000Z	daved	spundun_	put ubuntu install cd in, hit enter a bunch of times, reboot, done
2005-10-25T15:43:00.000Z	daved	spundun_	please go to #debian for debian install help
