2009-06-03T07:26:00.000Z	heidi	matrixblue	ok my ubuntu is 9.04 my printer is an hp what else do u need to know
2009-06-03T07:26:00.000Z	matrixblue	heidi	what's the model of the ho printer?
2009-06-03T07:27:00.000Z	matrixblue	heidi	that installation CD is most likely meant for Windows
2009-06-03T07:28:00.000Z	matrixblue	heidi	I'm looking for the driver for you
2009-06-03T07:30:00.000Z	matrixblue	heidi	the drivers for the printers most likely come with ubuntu
2009-06-03T07:30:00.000Z	matrixblue	heidi	go into System > Administration >Printing
2009-06-03T07:31:00.000Z	matrixblue	heidi	then click new
2009-06-03T07:32:00.000Z	matrixblue	heidi	does it have your printer listed there?
2009-06-03T07:33:00.000Z	matrixblue	heidi	is it allowing you to click forward? Ubuntu usually downloads the drivers for you
2009-06-03T07:34:00.000Z	matrixblue	heidi	that's a good sign. HP printers normally work very well on Ubuntu from my experience
2009-06-03T07:35:00.000Z	heidi	matrixblue	is printing thanks a lot :)
2009-06-03T07:35:00.000Z	matrixblue	heidi	anytime :)

2009-06-03T07:36:00.000Z	matrixblue	heidi	not even in test print?
2009-06-03T07:37:00.000Z	matrixblue	heidi	check to make sure that the right model printer is listen
2009-06-03T07:40:00.000Z	matrixblue	heidi	hmmmmmmmmm check the printer options for something like grayscale
2009-06-03T07:46:00.000Z	heidi	matrixblue	 now im getting only black and red
2009-06-03T07:46:00.000Z	matrixblue	heidi	keep trying. The problem is your settings
