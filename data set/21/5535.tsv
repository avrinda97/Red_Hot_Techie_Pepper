2008-08-15T21:31:00.000Z	SherlawkDragon		?
2008-08-15T21:32:00.000Z	SherlawkDragon		hmm..
2008-08-15T21:32:00.000Z	SherlawkDragon		maybe I don't remember...
2008-08-15T21:34:00.000Z	SherlawkDragon		wait a sec, what about this: I have an AMD64 processor, yet I'm using an HP, meaning the systems motherboard and stuff aren't meant for 64bit editions (yes, I thought that was insane too)
2008-08-15T21:34:00.000Z	SherlawkDragon		would that explain it?
2008-08-15T21:35:00.000Z	SherlawkDragon		wols_> that is what HP told me.
2008-08-15T21:35:00.000Z	SherlawkDragon		HP is Rubbish though... that;s true...
2008-08-15T21:36:00.000Z	SherlawkDragon		so, is it a common bug for the keyboard and menus in the gui to suddenly stop working?
2008-08-15T21:36:00.000Z	SherlawkDragon		and for programs to complain that they aren't written for the system?

2008-08-15T22:15:00.000Z	bazhang	SherlawkDragon	what mouse make and model; what were you doing when it stopped working, what are your system specs, those are bits of info we need to search for possible bugs and/or workarounds
