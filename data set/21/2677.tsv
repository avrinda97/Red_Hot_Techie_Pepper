2009-08-18T07:37:00.000Z	innomen		hey guys, what do i do after this "svn co https://kabikaboo.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/kabikaboo kabikaboo" ?
2009-08-18T07:38:00.000Z	C-S-B	innomen	compile or run it
2009-08-18T07:39:00.000Z	innomen	C-S-B	can you give me the basic command?
2009-08-20T07:33:00.000Z	C-S-B	innomen	i like where you're going... the only reason I havent formatted this machine and started over is purely cos I need it configured as it is and dont wat the hassle of setting it to this point again...
2009-08-20T07:34:00.000Z	innomen	C-S-B	remastersys seems designed expressly for that but its old and i cant get it installed, i am shocked that there isn't a more robust developed option for this, i mean what if i wanted to deploy ubunt in a lab of 50 machines? am i seriously expected to go do this package read write for each machine?
2009-08-20T07:35:00.000Z	C-S-B	innomen	true, also that doesnt cater for packages not in the repositry does it?
2009-08-20T07:35:00.000Z	innomen	C-S-B	nope, is there anything liek ghost for ubuntu?
2009-08-20T07:35:00.000Z	innomen	C-S-B	i mean i could always ghost the drive, delete my home folder and then deploy that way
2009-08-20T07:36:00.000Z	innomen	C-S-B	but thats just xerox, i kind want to rebuild from a given list of packages and sources
2009-08-20T07:36:00.000Z	innomen	C-S-B	like, system snap shot
2009-08-20T07:37:00.000Z	innomen	C-S-B	maybe you can take a look at remastersys ?
2009-08-20T07:38:00.000Z	C-S-B	innomen	I might when i get time. Ive been planning on formatting this machine and Ive been putting it off for karmic
2009-08-20T07:38:00.000Z	innomen	C-S-B	thats another scarey thing, once it comes time to update it really looks like i'm just going to have to start over from scratch'
2009-08-20T07:39:00.000Z	C-S-B	innomen	ouch...
2009-08-20T07:39:00.000Z	innomen	C-S-B	well i mean ghost wont help me, and there apears ot be no real way to migrate package and source choices or downloads
2009-08-20T07:40:00.000Z	C-S-B	innomen	if it helps, you can create a local network mirror of packages and install them on your machines from there. that wil stop a whole world of bandwith usuage
2009-08-20T07:40:00.000Z	innomen	C-S-B	i dont even know where the packages are stored
2009-08-20T07:42:00.000Z	C-S-B	innomen	you need suse studio :)
2009-08-20T07:45:00.000Z	C-S-B	innomen	you need to 'unlock'
2009-08-20T07:47:00.000Z	C-S-B	innomen	script it.
2009-08-20T07:55:00.000Z	innomen	C-S-B	thanks for your help, i'll let you know if i find a realistic solution. :)
