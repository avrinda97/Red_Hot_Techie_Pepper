2010-08-08T18:52:00.000Z	SauLus		hmm, i cant boot my ubuntu box. some shell is showing up. now ibooted the ubuntucd, ran fsck and did not find any error. any ideas?
2010-08-08T18:52:00.000Z	Yura87	SauLus	is your install full or frg?
2010-08-08T18:53:00.000Z	SauLus		frg? my installation is some weeks old and the sys was running fine.
2010-08-08T18:53:00.000Z	Yura87		with frugal, just get rid of all your session-files
2010-08-08T18:54:00.000Z	Yura87		and ensure that linux is in frugal setup on one of the secondary drives (not C:)
2010-08-08T18:55:00.000Z	SauLus	Yura87	what is frugal? was it the answer to me? i did not insztall ubuntu in ntfs, if that is frugal
2010-08-08T18:56:00.000Z	Yura87		frugal install is when you have it in .sfs's that are mounted into a "no-emulation" img
2010-08-08T18:56:00.000Z	SauLus		fine, but do you have any ideas what i could try to find the problem why my ubuntu 10.04lts64 is not starting any longer?
2010-08-08T18:57:00.000Z	Yura87	SauLus	if your install is frugal, try to delete .2fs or .3fs or w/e session files
2010-08-08T18:58:00.000Z	Yura87		as you are on ntfs, your install obviously contains of .sfs's
2010-08-08T18:58:00.000Z	SauLus	Yura87	i just booted the standard ubuntu64bit cd. i assume i am not using frugar
2010-08-08T18:59:00.000Z	Yura87	SauLus	LiveCD IS frugal
2010-08-08T18:59:00.000Z	SauLus	Yura87	m installation is not booting. so why should i delete temporary files during the live-session?
2010-08-08T19:00:00.000Z	SauLus		my
2010-08-08T19:00:00.000Z	Yura87		mahloo, it's not possible in most cases to grab src off bin
2010-08-08T19:00:00.000Z	Yura87		Delete sessionfiles of your usual install
2010-08-08T19:01:00.000Z	Yura87		they are usually .2fs or something - refer to ubuntu wiki or UnionFS wiki
2010-08-08T19:03:00.000Z	Yura87	SauLus	did you delete your 2fs?
2010-08-08T19:04:00.000Z	Yura87		Haha, you ubuntu people use frugal install without knowing what it is!
2010-08-08T19:05:00.000Z	Yura87		and, why does Puppy's eth# setup go easier than that in Ubuntu?
2010-08-08T19:06:00.000Z	SauLus	Yura87	i think you misread my problem. so i reinstalled grub and retried booting . . . still waiting for the system, but it stays black after grub
