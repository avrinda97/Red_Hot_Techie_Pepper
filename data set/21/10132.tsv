2006-11-19T09:23:00.000Z	rbrtoclto		no luck with the edgy reinstall
2006-11-19T09:23:00.000Z	rbrtoclto		installs with no errors, I reboot and after the POST just get a blank, black screen with a blinking cursor top left corner about 3 lines down
2006-11-19T09:24:00.000Z	rbrtoclto		I don't see any messages from grub being displayed
2006-11-19T09:24:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	rbrtoclto	have you tried changing your boot lines and removing 'splash' ?
2006-11-19T09:25:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	rbrtoclto	boot up, when GRUB comes up, hit 'e', select the boot line, remove 'splash' and hit 'b' to boot that option
2006-11-19T09:25:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	rbrtoclto	oh hmm
2006-11-19T09:26:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	rbrtoclto	not sure what to tell you there
2006-11-19T09:27:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	rbrtoclto	the install worked and completed o.k.?  Did you do any manual overrides of partitions or just a default install?
2006-11-19T09:27:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	rbrtoclto	ahh , maybe a hardware issue, I was wondering that
2006-11-19T09:28:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	rbrtoclto	they were on the system during the install or you added them after?
2006-11-19T09:29:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	rbrtoclto	the system may be loading the drives in a different order, as in it is detecting the wrong drive as the first drive
2006-11-19T09:30:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	rbrtoclto	I know you don't want to hear this, but if you do an install, try partitioning/labeling them and see if that fixes it
2006-11-19T09:30:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	rbrtoclto	you can undo that later, just give them a fake name
2006-11-19T09:30:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	rbrtoclto	like /foo and /bar
2006-11-19T09:31:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	rbrtoclto	where I'm going with that is that the partitions are mounted via UUID now after install, if you label those other drives, it might sneak them by the system until you can deal with them after install
2006-11-19T09:31:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	rbrtoclto	ah, good point
2006-11-19T09:31:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	rbrtoclto	grub shouldn't care
2006-11-19T09:32:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	rbrtoclto	if you boot the live cd, any hints as to what drive numbers are seen on the system, maybe you can change the labels in menu.lst based on that?
2006-11-19T09:32:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	rbrtoclto	I wonder, did GRUB not install on the boot device in mbr maybe?
2006-11-19T09:33:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	rbrtoclto	does your BIOS let you pick boot devices, try switching to each drive and see if it finds GRUB one the wrong one
2006-11-19T09:34:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	rbrtoclto	k, another thing, may not be your issue, I have a Dell LCD at work where during bootup I'm 'blind' until X comes up, console modes don't work with it
