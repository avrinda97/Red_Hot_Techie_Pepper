2011-02-18T13:34:00.000Z	Poss		ok so im at my uncle's house, and i noticed that their copy of ubuntu was pretty old and needed a lot of updating
2011-02-18T13:35:00.000Z	Poss		he was on karmic koala
2011-02-18T13:35:00.000Z	Poss		since support is ended for karmic I hit upgrade to lynx, since its an LTS
2011-02-18T13:36:00.000Z	Poss		three hours pass as its downloading and upgrading, then I come back and the screen is just saying "unsupported input", so i though "hmm" I'll reboot and see whats going on here
2011-02-18T13:36:00.000Z	Poss		but on a straight reboot i just get too the ubuntu logo on a black screen, nothing else
2011-02-18T13:37:00.000Z	Poss		so then I restarted in recovery mode
2011-02-18T13:37:00.000Z	Poss		last thing that happens is that app armor profiles fail to load and then run-init: /sbin/init: I/O error
2011-02-18T13:38:00.000Z	Poss		followed by kernel panic
2011-02-18T13:38:00.000Z	Poss		at which point I did as told and paniced
2011-02-18T13:39:00.000Z	Poss		so now I'm sitting here with my uncle and auntwanting to use the computer i just screwed by hitting update
2011-02-18T13:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Poss	it'll be quick :)
2011-02-18T13:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Poss	no, the updates
2011-02-18T13:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Poss	reboot, hold shift and select an older kernel
2011-02-18T13:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Poss	try booting to liveCD and fsck the partition as well as test your ram
2011-02-18T13:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Poss	then test ram from grub
2011-02-18T14:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Poss	d'oh. time for a new drive and a data restore
2011-02-18T14:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Poss	they don't have a backup?
2011-02-18T14:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Poss	like, seriously!?
2011-02-18T14:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Poss	thats fine, only the system drive is dying
2011-02-18T14:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Poss	btw your OS isn't to blame if the hardware physically dies
2011-02-18T14:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Poss	I guess, i will work the drive some
