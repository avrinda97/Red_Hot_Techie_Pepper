2011-04-18T00:28:00.000Z	dean		Hi I was wondering if someone could help me with usb support for virtualbox?
2011-04-18T00:29:00.000Z	dean		Is anyone talking?
2011-04-18T00:30:00.000Z	ikonia	dean	only the non-free virtualbox version has usb support
2011-06-22T00:34:00.000Z	ikonia	dean	yes
2011-09-26T18:01:00.000Z	ikonia	dean	yes, why
2011-09-26T18:02:00.000Z	dean	ikonia	I was wondering if you knew what option you have to select to make sure the subtitles appear after converting?
2011-09-26T18:03:00.000Z	ikonia	dean	there is a subtitle check box
2011-09-26T18:03:00.000Z	ikonia	dean	there is also the #handbrake channel
2011-09-26T18:03:00.000Z	dean	ikonia	There is default, burned in and forced I didn't know which is best to use
2011-09-26T18:04:00.000Z	ikonia	dean	#handbrake is your friend on that one, I never use subtitles so don't understand the difference
2011-09-26T18:04:00.000Z	dean	ikonia	Ok thanks
2011-09-26T18:43:00.000Z	dean	ikonia	Hey I spoke to you before and you were a great help do you find your conversions on handbrake come out at m4v not mp4?
2011-09-26T18:44:00.000Z	ikonia	dean	they use the mp4 container but normally have an different extension
2011-09-26T18:45:00.000Z	dean	ikonia	What it is I have a samsung lcd tv with a usb media player and I know it plays avi and mp4 but not sure it would play m4v but I wondered if I could get it to convert to mp4 instead?
2011-09-26T18:46:00.000Z	ikonia	dean	mp4 container in an m4v extension
2011-09-26T18:49:00.000Z	dean	ikonia	I have read it isn't the same as mp4 though just uses the same codec
2011-09-26T18:49:00.000Z	ikonia	dean	again, #handbrake is your friend
2011-09-26T19:04:00.000Z	dean	ikonia	Sorry only just seen your message I am going to do one chapter and try it on my tv
2011-09-26T19:05:00.000Z	ikonia	dean	no problem
2011-09-26T19:06:00.000Z	dean	ikonia	Thanks again tho
2011-09-26T19:06:00.000Z	ikonia	dean	welcome
