2008-11-30T08:10:00.000Z	level15		so... does anyone here use encrypted volumes?
2008-11-30T08:10:00.000Z	budz0r	level15	i use trucrypt to manage my incrypted drives. have you tried it?
2008-11-30T08:11:00.000Z	level15	budz0r	no, i am using dm-crypt, but have some issues with it
2008-11-30T08:11:00.000Z	budz0r	level15	google trucrypt - its free and i like it a lot :)
2008-11-30T08:11:00.000Z	budz0r	level15	warning: it MIGHT not be exaclty what you are looking for. read about it frist.
2008-11-30T08:12:00.000Z	level15	budz0r	yeah, i've seen it, was planning to use it for my win partition
2008-11-30T08:13:00.000Z	budz0r	level15	well thats what i really like about it. it has windows and linux versions so they are very compatible. if anything you could just format that little sucker and use trucrypt this time to be sure you won't have any problems.
2008-11-30T08:14:00.000Z	level15	budz0r	i was hoping it would not come to that, but maybe...
2008-11-30T08:15:00.000Z	budz0r	level15	can you get to that data in windows?
2008-11-30T08:15:00.000Z	level15	budz0r	no, i only use it under linux
2008-11-30T08:16:00.000Z	budz0r	level15	then now'd you make it in the first place?
2008-11-30T08:32:00.000Z	budz0r	level15	not giving up i see :)
2008-11-30T08:32:00.000Z	level15	budz0r	too lazy to format-reinstall... not to mention the fact i don't hae a spare 500 GB to put the data while reformatting
2008-11-30T08:33:00.000Z	budz0r	level15	good god. i thought you were talking about a jump drive haha
2008-11-30T08:33:00.000Z	budz0r	level15	you encrypted the whole drive?
2008-11-30T08:33:00.000Z	level15	budz0r	esternal USB HDD
2008-11-30T08:33:00.000Z	level15	budz0r	yup
2008-11-30T08:33:00.000Z	level15	budz0r	i'm paranoid :-S
2008-11-30T08:34:00.000Z	budz0r	level15	apparently! lol
2008-11-30T08:39:00.000Z	level15	budz0r	thanks
