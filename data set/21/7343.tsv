2006-10-20T07:53:00.000Z	elvar		when i try to stream something from a site the file is  400mb and i am trying to watch it but i get this error-> The xine engine failed to start. No input plugin was found. Maybe the file does not exist or cannot be accessed, or there is an error in the URL.
2006-10-20T07:54:00.000Z	elvar		what does this mean -> The xine engine failed to start. No input plugin was found. Maybe the file does not exist or cannot be accessed, or there is an error in the URL. please somebody
2006-10-20T07:55:00.000Z	dougsko	elvar	you probly dont have the codec to play whatever youre trying to play. or the site sucks and theres an error in the URL
2006-10-20T07:55:00.000Z	dougsko	elvar	or Maybe the file does not exist or  cannot be accessed
2006-10-20T07:57:00.000Z	dougsko	elvar	i have no idea what kind of file it is...you might need wmv codecs, you might need all kinds of stuff
2006-10-20T07:57:00.000Z	dougsko	elvar	either way, get vlc, its the best video player in the entire world
2006-10-20T07:58:00.000Z	elvar	dougsko	:/ but how can i start with vlc :)when i click on this link -> http://vzj43867:cejekea8@members.videosz.com/movie.php?lg=us&player=1&dvd_id=791&scene_type=movie&id_place=2&file=http%3A%2F%2Fmembers.videosz.com%2F6%2F791%2F6-black-sticks-1-white-trick-3-scene2.avi  it will only bring up xine error
2006-10-20T07:59:00.000Z	dougsko	elvar	you probly have to assiciate .avi's with vlc in your browser
2006-10-20T08:00:00.000Z	elvar	dougsko	but how can i let this vlc rise when this xine stuff runs automatic when i click on the link :( is there a way to change this ?
2006-10-20T08:34:00.000Z	dougsko	elvar	try playing a real movie file and not some wack pr0n which introduces like 10 more variables into the situation
2006-10-20T08:35:00.000Z	dougsko	elvar	so what? youre trying to troubleshoot right? thats how you do it
2006-10-20T08:35:00.000Z	dougsko	elvar	vlc
2006-10-20T08:37:00.000Z	elvar	dougsko	there is no problem playing .movies.

2006-10-20T08:39:00.000Z	dougsko	elvar	jesus dude...
2006-10-20T08:43:00.000Z	elvar	dougsko	i chooce another site and the same shitt happins agein
2006-10-20T08:44:00.000Z	dougsko	elvar	dude, i dont even know what kind of browser youre using. from the extremely poor way youve been trying to explain this problem, i can only *guess* that its a file association problem. read your browser's docs or google around on how to change that
2006-10-20T08:50:00.000Z	elvar	dougsko	ok thx man
2006-10-20T08:50:00.000Z	dougsko	elvar	so it was a file association problem?
2006-10-20T08:51:00.000Z	dougsko	elvar	i didnt mean to get on your case like that, but being able to explain your problem *is* half the problem
