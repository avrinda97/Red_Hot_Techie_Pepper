2005-11-20T09:55:00.000Z	Talisker		err... how do I get my system to run a certain bash script when I log in?
2005-11-20T09:56:00.000Z	Xenguy	Talisker	that can be configured in Gnome via menus
2005-11-20T09:57:00.000Z	Talisker		and is there a way to do so NOT using gnome?
2005-11-20T09:59:00.000Z	Talisker		I do not use gnome
2005-11-20T09:59:00.000Z	Xenguy	Talisker	what do you use, kde?
2005-11-20T09:59:00.000Z	Talisker		nope
2005-11-20T09:59:00.000Z	Talisker		ion
2005-11-20T09:59:00.000Z	Talisker		I do not have a desktop
2005-11-20T10:00:00.000Z	Talisker		only a wm
2005-11-20T10:00:00.000Z	Xenguy	Talisker	I'm using xfce4 ATM, and it has it's own mechanism (Autostart); perhaps ion has something similar?
2005-11-20T10:00:00.000Z	Talisker		a simple bash script that defines some stuff, and starts my applications with certain flags and kludges
2005-11-20T10:01:00.000Z	Talisker	Xenguy	the whole philosophy behind ion is that it's not a desktop enviorment, thus it has no function that's supposed to do stuff that's not a window menager's job
2005-11-20T10:01:00.000Z	Talisker		there should be an init script per user
2005-11-20T10:01:00.000Z	Xenguy	Talisker	maybe you can call it through .xsession ?  I'm really not sure if not
2005-11-20T10:01:00.000Z	Xenguy		er, ~/.xsession
2005-11-20T10:02:00.000Z	Talisker		.xsession, is it located at ~/.xsession?
2005-11-20T10:02:00.000Z	Talisker		no, it's not supposed to be ion specific
2005-11-20T10:02:00.000Z	Xenguy	Talisker	^^
2005-11-20T10:02:00.000Z	Talisker		it's supposed to be run as I login
2005-11-20T10:02:00.000Z	Talisker		regardless of the WM I'm using
2005-11-20T10:02:00.000Z	Xenguy	Talisker	OK, try ~/.xsession then (my best guess)
