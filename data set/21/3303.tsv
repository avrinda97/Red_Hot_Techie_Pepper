2009-02-08T18:09:00.000Z	rakudave	king	I had to remove pulse-audio to get mine to work
2009-02-08T18:09:00.000Z	king	rakudave	Oh
2009-02-08T18:09:00.000Z	king	rakudave	Could you please point me to the links, references that helped you?
2009-02-08T18:09:00.000Z	king	rakudave	I was really hoping that I could get it to work with pulseaudio
2009-02-08T18:10:00.000Z	rakudave	king	simply "sudo apt-get remove pulse-audio" in a terminal
2009-02-08T18:10:00.000Z	king	rakudave	And then? It starts working?
2009-02-08T18:11:00.000Z	rakudave	king	it did for me
2009-02-08T18:11:00.000Z	king	rakudave	Doesn't anything else breakdown? I mean the whole sound is now handled by pulse audio.
2009-02-08T18:11:00.000Z	king	rakudave	How do you change between the internal speakers (of the laptop) and the usb speakers?
2009-02-08T18:11:00.000Z	rakudave	king	no, ALSA is responsible for your sound, pulse-audio is just a tool to "connect" multiple sources
2009-02-08T18:12:00.000Z	rakudave	king	change speakers in "system--settings--sound"
2009-02-08T18:14:00.000Z	king	rakudave	Wouldn't removing pulse audio cause any other problems?
2009-02-08T18:14:00.000Z	king	rakudave	Are there some other things that you have got to change?
2009-02-08T18:15:00.000Z	rakudave	king	i had no problems after removing it, but you can always reinstall it by "sudo apt-get install pulse-audio"
2009-02-08T18:16:00.000Z	king	rakudave	I found a solution. In the Preferences > Sound dialog box I just selected my usb devices in sound playback and they work!
2009-02-08T18:16:00.000Z	king	rakudave	Did you try that?
2009-02-08T18:16:00.000Z	rakudave	king	Good for you :-) Mine wouldn't while pulse was still around...
2009-02-08T18:17:00.000Z	king	rakudave	Thanks for the tip, I figured out at some point I would have to select the usb speakers in the Sound dialog box but I couldn't believe that it would really 'just work'!
2009-02-08T18:18:00.000Z	rakudave	king	I didn't think of suggesting that, as it hasn't worked in my case... :-/
2009-02-08T18:18:00.000Z	rakudave	king	but if it does for you, good :-D
2009-02-08T18:19:00.000Z	king	rakudave	:)
