2009-01-30T00:04:00.000Z	grindking		thinking about putting ubuntu on my brand new machine, phenom 9950
2009-01-30T00:05:00.000Z	neosuki	grindking	that's a welcome move! :)
2009-01-30T00:05:00.000Z	grindking	neosuki	im tempted to do it haha, i already dislike vista
2009-01-30T00:06:00.000Z	neosuki	grindking	cheers to Ubuntu!
2009-01-30T00:06:00.000Z	grindking	neosuki	would it be a bad idea to convert 8.10 intrepid desktop install to more of a server setup? i mean, i've used debian for 10 years so i know my way around, or would you suggest installing the server version?
2009-01-30T00:08:00.000Z	neosuki	grindking	my guess, to go for server version itself... but frankly donno abt fallbacks for desktop version :p
2009-01-30T00:08:00.000Z	neosuki	grindking	if u don't mind, may i know the work around u've, just curious to know :p
2009-01-30T00:09:00.000Z	grindking	neosuki	work around for what?
2009-01-30T00:09:00.000Z	grindking	neosuki	i just meant i know my way around debian, so i would be able to manually remove packages, etc if i had to
2009-01-30T00:10:00.000Z	neosuki	grindking	just u said, ' i know my way around' rite? tht's y i'm asking
2009-01-30T00:10:00.000Z	grindking	neosuki	yah like i'm not a new user i meant :D
2009-01-30T00:10:00.000Z	neosuki	grindking	oh... may be i've misunderstood :)
2009-01-30T00:11:00.000Z	grindking	neosuki	i can be quite vague at times on irc, probably my fault haha
2009-01-30T00:12:00.000Z	neosuki	grindking	for server, which one of the linux flavor where u using earlier?
2009-01-30T00:13:00.000Z	grindking	neosuki	debian, unstable, sid
2009-01-30T00:14:00.000Z	grindking	neosuki	since like 1999 or so
2009-01-30T00:15:00.000Z	neosuki	grindking	debian unstable for server? why is it so?
2009-01-30T00:16:00.000Z	grindking	neosuki	no, the development branch is called 'unstable'
2009-01-30T00:16:00.000Z	grindking	neosuki	kind of a bad name if you ask me haha
2009-01-30T00:16:00.000Z	neosuki	grindking	:D
