2009-10-02T16:11:00.000Z	elad`		I have two monitors. I'd like for different desktops to be associated with them, so that when I ctrl-alt-left or ctrl-alt-right, I'll move between the monitors. Can I do that?
2009-10-02T16:11:00.000Z	elad`		Right now, if I have an application running on a desktop associated with one screen, I can't move it to the next (or at least, I don't know how).
2009-10-02T16:12:00.000Z	elad`		Also, switching between the desktops associated with the different monitors appears to be accomplished by moving the mouse off the edge of the screen. But how do I do that with the keyboard?
2009-10-02T16:13:00.000Z	elad`		Also, when I launch a new application, I don't know on which screen it will end up.
2009-10-02T16:13:00.000Z	elad`		Help?
2009-10-02T16:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	elad`	the keyboard is universlly available to both, the X server you have has simply stretch over 2 displays
2009-10-02T16:15:00.000Z	elad`	ActionParsnip1	I have four desktops associated with the left monitor session, and four with the right. I don't know how to move applications between them (only within each quartet).
2009-10-02T16:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	elad`	just drag it over?
2009-10-02T16:16:00.000Z	elad`	ActionParsnip1	impossible.
2009-10-02T16:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	elad`	you can have a seperate X screen on each but i am unsure of mouse / keyoard handling
2009-10-02T16:20:00.000Z	elad`	ActionParsnip1	could you find some tutorial for me? I'm not really good at looking those things up.
2009-10-02T16:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	elad`	you'll be messing in xorg.conf LOTS
2009-10-02T16:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	elad`	you will have to setup 4 video cards, 4 monitors, then 4 screens, then 1 server with teh 4 screens
2009-10-02T16:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	elad`	didnt you say you had 4 monitors?
2009-10-02T16:24:00.000Z	elad`	ActionParsnip1	no. Just two. I have four /desktops/ associated with them. You know, those virtual desktops that come with Ubuntu by default?
2009-10-02T16:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	elad`	oh i see
2009-10-02T16:25:00.000Z	elad`	ActionParsnip1	so? Is it possible?
2009-10-02T16:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	elad`	i gotcha
2009-10-02T16:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	elad`	so you will need 2 X servers then.
2009-10-02T16:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	elad`	here is an example file for 2 displays with 2 seperate x servers: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=447511
2009-10-02T16:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	elad`	i made a 2-seater once (2 mice, 2 monitors, 2 keyboards, 1 PC)
