2011-08-09T16:37:00.000Z	maptz		 I'm trying to join a samba domain with my XP client but xp client says "domain can't be join". I see UDP packets from client to  pdc and other way. my pdc is ready and listen to connection with an ldap backend. I use smbldap-tools and they are configure such as nsswitch.conf. Someone can help me for this?
2011-08-09T16:39:00.000Z	blackshirt	maptz	are you have configure your samba, ldap, correctly ?
2011-08-09T16:40:00.000Z	maptz	blackshirt	I think unless I miss something
2011-08-09T16:42:00.000Z	blackshirt	maptz	i have ever configure it, and works greats..but i forgot for documenting it
2011-08-09T16:45:00.000Z	blackshirt	maptz	are you sure name resolving was not your problem ?
2011-08-09T16:47:00.000Z	maptz	blackshirt	I don't think, samba is wins server too and name resolve order = lmhosts host wins bcast.
2011-08-09T16:49:00.000Z	maptz	blackshirt	I'll check that
2011-08-09T16:49:00.000Z	blackshirt	maptz	yeah.. i'm not my office server..sory can't help you so much
2011-08-09T16:55:00.000Z	maptz	blackshirt	I add a wins server in XP client, i have the same message but a log.clientName  appear, i'll check it
2011-08-09T16:56:00.000Z	blackshirt	maptz	i'm waiting for that
2011-08-09T16:58:00.000Z	maptz	blackshirt	All right, I'm in my domain! It was a name resolution error I think because I just change wins options in windows
2011-08-09T16:59:00.000Z	blackshirt	maptz	greats works...congratulations
2011-08-09T17:02:00.000Z	maptz	blackshirt	Thank you... but it was just the first part. Now I have to configure a remote bdc for my pdc. I'm try to do that since one week but I can't join the domain with a client in bdc's subnet
2011-08-09T17:03:00.000Z	blackshirt	maptz	i no have experience to setup with bdc..but i think from help.ubuntu.com there are greats howto
