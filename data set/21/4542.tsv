2008-04-07T00:19:00.000Z	BrainBug	ir4	not familiar for me, but try looking at /etc/network/interface
2008-04-07T00:19:00.000Z	BrainBug	ir4	try iwconfig
2008-04-07T00:20:00.000Z	BrainBug	ir4	if u see a card eg eth1 is up try dhclient eth1
2008-04-07T00:20:00.000Z	BrainBug	ir4	k some other? like ath0 or whatever
2008-04-07T00:21:00.000Z	BrainBug	ir4	so thats what u need eth1
2008-04-07T00:21:00.000Z	BrainBug	ir4	try sudo dhclient eth1
2008-04-07T00:23:00.000Z	BrainBug	ir4	try dhcp first
2008-04-07T00:23:00.000Z	BrainBug	ir4	later when u know how to work with it try static
2008-04-07T00:24:00.000Z	BrainBug	ir4	that would be eth1 - your wireless try going online now or ping www.google.com
2008-04-07T00:25:00.000Z	BrainBug	ir4	try ifconfig
2008-04-07T00:25:00.000Z	BrainBug	ir4	put down the cable network eg ifdown eth0 (to get it back up try ifup eth0)
2008-04-07T00:27:00.000Z	BrainBug	ir4	/sbin/ifconfig or try sudo ifconfig
2008-04-07T00:28:00.000Z	BrainBug	ir4	ah k but u can see or your wireless works by ifconfig eth1 see or it has an IP adress if it has your good
2008-04-07T00:29:00.000Z	BrainBug	ir4	good it works fine now
2008-04-07T00:29:00.000Z	BrainBug	ir4	look in /etc/network/inferface
2008-04-07T00:30:00.000Z	BrainBug	ir4	there u can configure, but for that i recommend google :P cause really depends
2008-04-07T00:36:00.000Z	BrainBug	ir4	depend on what files, and what u need, but skip cant hurt when u have an error missing something just apt-get install <file>
2008-04-07T00:37:00.000Z	BrainBug	ir4	no cause all works like it is now
