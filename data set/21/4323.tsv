2008-05-14T10:21:00.000Z	legend2440	whuut	it uses same server for updates
2008-05-14T10:22:00.000Z	whuut	legend2440	i've already tried that, it's really slow. I have a server local server address. how do i change it so that ubuntu searches from the custom server address that is'nt on the default list?
2008-05-14T10:23:00.000Z	legend2440	whuut	did you try Best Server button and let it test for fastest server?
2008-05-14T10:24:00.000Z	whuut	legend2440	yes, it said that it couldn't locate the best for me; i have a local address that i tested that works, how do i change it to this?
2008-05-14T10:27:00.000Z	legend2440	whuut	oh i see what you mean. gksu gedit /etc/apt/sources.list. try adding it there
2008-05-14T10:28:00.000Z	whuut	legend2440	what should i edit?
2008-05-14T10:28:00.000Z	whuut	legend2440	what should i edit in the sources.list file?
2008-05-14T10:30:00.000Z	legend2440	whuut	what is the address of the custom server you want to use?
2008-05-14T10:31:00.000Z	whuut	legend2440	i'm going to use this server: http://dl2.foss-id.web.id/ubuntu/dists/
2008-05-14T10:33:00.000Z	legend2440	whuut	you would have to replace all the http: addresses that are in your sources list with the custom address you want to use. i would backup the old one first though
2008-05-14T10:37:00.000Z	whuut	legend2440	thank you very much, it worked :-)
