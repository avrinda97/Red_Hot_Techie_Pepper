2008-07-11T01:26:00.000Z	amh		Im an ubuntu n00b.  everytime i have someone in my group create a folder or copy files-- the permissions are always for that user and not the whole group!  I've configured the group too have the permissions i wanted too.
2008-07-11T01:27:00.000Z	amh		can  anyone tell me how to do this permissions thing? right now they've copied something to a web server but the permissions are-rw-r-r-- which is no good
2008-07-11T01:29:00.000Z	amh		can anyone help my permissions issue?
2008-07-11T01:29:00.000Z	unop	amh	how are your files being uploaded to the server?
2008-07-11T01:30:00.000Z	amh	unop	ftp mostly.
2008-07-11T01:30:00.000Z	amh	unop	but sometimes i just copy them over in explorer...
2008-07-11T01:30:00.000Z	unop	amh	you'll need to configure the umask directive in your ftpd's config file
2008-07-11T01:31:00.000Z	unop	amh	also check the umask of the directory you are uploading to (on the server)
2008-07-11T01:31:00.000Z	unop	amh	if vsftpd is what you use
2008-07-11T01:32:00.000Z	unop	amh	well, if you want permissions preserved in their entirety -- umask ought to be 000 - but be warned, this is severely insecure -- anyone could upload something dangerous and have the chance to execute it
2008-07-11T01:33:00.000Z	unop	amh	the default umask is secure - i suggest you keep it unless you have a real specific need to change it, and if you do change it, make sure you secure your machine up properly
2008-07-11T01:33:00.000Z	amh	unop	but the files that are being ftp'd can't even be read over http due to the permissions..  its 022 right now
2008-07-11T01:34:00.000Z	unop	amh	not ftp access, they'll need some kind of shell or script running (e.g. those running on webservers) -- but, if vsftpd ever has an exploit and people can invoke a shell through it, you have a big problem
2008-07-11T01:34:00.000Z	amh	unop	what should ftp umask be, generally?
2008-07-11T01:35:00.000Z	unop	amh	I think you need to configure permissions via ownership on that directory -- make sure that the www-data group has ability to read on that directory
2008-07-11T01:37:00.000Z	unop	amh	 if you have apache - then you should have that group -- verify with.  grep -i www /etc/group
2008-07-11T01:39:00.000Z	unop	amh	right, so you need to have the www-data get read permissions on the directory in question
2008-07-11T01:40:00.000Z	unop	amh	you can only give users and groups permissions to read/write/execute -- not files and directories themselves
2008-07-11T01:42:00.000Z	amh	unop	so this i think bering me back to square one.  My group has the proper permissions.  which i thought meant all user in that group would have those permissions when uploading/moving/creating.. but this is not the case as i cannot delete anything by a user in my own group.
2008-07-11T01:43:00.000Z	unop	amh	which group owns that directory? ;)  i'm hinting at something here
2008-07-11T01:44:00.000Z	amh	unop	the group that owns that directory (www) is root
