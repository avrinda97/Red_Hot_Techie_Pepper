2005-12-26T08:28:00.000Z	Froo		Hello.
2005-12-26T08:28:00.000Z	Froo		Is this Ubuntu support?
2005-12-26T08:30:00.000Z	Froo		I have what should be an easy Ubuntu question, if someone feels up to trying to answer - I can't increase my screen resolution. I have been editing files like xorg.conf to no avail. I can't find the XF86Config file at all.
2005-12-26T08:31:00.000Z	emptystapler	Froo	what kind of video card?
2005-12-26T08:31:00.000Z	Froo		NVIDIA GeForce 4
2005-12-26T08:31:00.000Z	emptystapler	Froo	do the options simply not appear in the gnome menu?
2005-12-26T08:33:00.000Z	Froo	emptystapler	That's right - When I was installing, I chose 1024x768 as the highest - I didn't want to take any chances because I had done a previous install with too high of a resolution, and then I couldn't get anything at all. So, I chose too low to be safe, but now I know the correct res. and I want to reset it to that...
2005-12-26T08:33:00.000Z	emptystapler	Froo	can you locate your xorg.conf file? it's in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2005-12-26T08:34:00.000Z	Froo	emptystapler	Sure can - I have been there a few times already.
2005-12-26T08:34:00.000Z	emptystapler	Froo	okay, let me message you and see if I can find anything amiss
2005-12-26T08:35:00.000Z	Froo		Excellent - Thanks.
2005-12-26T08:38:00.000Z	emptystapler		anybody have any thoughts here? i can't get static IP assignment to work. i can ping my router using it, but DNS lookups fail (i have set my gateway and DNS entry to point to my router, and DHCP works)
2005-12-26T08:38:00.000Z	emptystapler	Froo	are you getting my messages?
2005-12-26T08:38:00.000Z	Froo	emptystapler	No. I was wondering if you were sending any.
2005-12-26T08:39:00.000Z	emptystapler	Froo	I definitely sent them!
2005-12-26T08:39:00.000Z	emptystapler	Froo	Oohhhh...
