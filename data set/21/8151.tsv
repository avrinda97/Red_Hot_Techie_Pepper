2006-05-27T13:14:00.000Z	Flannel	achandra	they're on the CD, but yeah, the stuff that isn't included cna be downloaded
2006-05-27T13:14:00.000Z	Flannel	achandra	yes, only one CD.
2006-05-27T13:15:00.000Z	Flannel	achandra	which distro?  debian 6cds?
2006-05-27T13:15:00.000Z	Flannel	achandra	ah.  I was going t say, debian's CDs are just downloaded additional packages.  but yeah, one CD.
2006-05-27T13:17:00.000Z	Flannel	achandra	yes.  Ubuntu is based on debian.
2006-05-27T13:20:00.000Z	Flannel	achandra	asterisk is in ubuntu repositories, yes. openser isnt.
2007-02-26T13:26:00.000Z	Flannel	achandra	don't use ubuntuguide
2007-02-26T13:26:00.000Z	achandra	Flannel	why??
2007-02-26T13:27:00.000Z	Flannel	achandra	because some stuff it recommends is unsafe.  And almost all of the stuff it walks you through is available on the wiki (help.ubuntu.com) anyway (in safe methods)
2007-02-26T13:28:00.000Z	achandra	Flannel	any help for wompus-cat and his nvidia issue/audigy se ...my google search yielded only the ubuntu guide entry
2007-02-26T13:35:00.000Z	achandra	Flannel	she might want to try the work around I posted earlier just to see...and back up any config files...
