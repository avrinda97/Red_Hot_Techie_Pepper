2005-08-28T11:13:00.000Z	tristanmike	lui	could this relate to the add/remove problem where I believe python-xdg is fixed?
2005-08-28T11:14:00.000Z	lui	tristanmike	I really don't know man! :P
2005-08-28T11:14:00.000Z	tristanmike	lui	gimmie a sec ok
2005-08-28T11:16:00.000Z	lui	tristanmike	sure
2005-08-28T11:20:00.000Z	tristanmike	lui	could open your add/remove and tell me if it in fact opens?
2005-08-28T11:22:00.000Z	lui	tristanmike	it opens
2005-08-28T11:23:00.000Z	tristanmike	lui	ok there was a bug with python-xdg not alowing add/remove to open so I thought the broken package might be casuing your proplem, obviously not.
2005-08-28T11:28:00.000Z	lui	tristanmike	ok, lets forget apt-get. maybe you can tell me what should I do with the script to install that smeg that the ubuntu forums put in this page: http://dev.realistanew.com/smeg/installsmeg
2005-08-28T11:32:00.000Z	tristanmike	lui	i believe you just save the page to your home directory with the default name, open a terminal, and type ./<nameofscript>
