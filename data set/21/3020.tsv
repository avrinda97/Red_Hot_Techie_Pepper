2009-04-24T12:48:00.000Z	DansTheMan1		I am wondering how to resize a partition using GParted
2009-04-24T12:49:00.000Z	DansTheMan1		As it isn't really letting me =(
2009-04-24T12:50:00.000Z	DansTheMan1		However, it says on the partition i want to resize: Minimum Size: 52107; Maximum Size: 52107
2009-04-24T12:50:00.000Z	DansTheMan1		I don't understand it.
2009-04-24T12:50:00.000Z	DansTheMan1		=(
2009-04-24T12:50:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb	DansTheMan1	is the drive mounted?
2009-04-24T12:50:00.000Z	DansTheMan1		I don't know, TheFunkbom.
2009-04-24T12:50:00.000Z	DansTheMan1		*thefunkbomb
2009-04-24T12:51:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb		I don't think you can mess with a mounted drive
2009-04-24T12:51:00.000Z	DansTheMan1		I believe it is though, thefunkbomb, as i can access it in Windows.
2009-04-24T12:51:00.000Z	DansTheMan1		How do i unmount it then TheFunkbomb?
2009-04-24T12:51:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb		that's a good question
2009-04-24T12:51:00.000Z	DansTheMan1	TheFunkbomb	When i right-click, Unmount is grayed out :(
2009-04-24T12:51:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb		well, that's never good
2009-04-24T12:52:00.000Z	DansTheMan1	TheFunkbomb	Do you know any ways to resolve this issue or why the menu option is grayed out?
2009-04-24T12:52:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb		I'm thinking
2009-04-24T12:52:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb		go into a terminal and type in cd /dev/disk
2009-04-24T12:53:00.000Z	DansTheMan1		I checked the drive and it said to run a chkdsk /f on windows.
2009-04-24T12:53:00.000Z	DansTheMan1		Ok
2009-04-24T12:53:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb		ah
2009-04-24T12:53:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb	DansTheMan1	boot up in windows and chkdsk it
