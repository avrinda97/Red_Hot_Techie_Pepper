2012-10-15T01:35:00.000Z	mrojas6996		Hello! i have a small problem with fstab
2012-10-15T01:37:00.000Z	mrojas6996		I had 2 SWAP partitions duplicated by accidentally, when i delete the 2nd swap partition, FSTAB show an error with a UUID missing
2012-10-15T01:37:00.000Z	mrojas6996		that is the 2nd SWAP partition that i delete
2012-10-15T01:38:00.000Z	TJ-	mrojas6996	Correct the UUID mentioned in fstab, to be the UUID of the remaining swap partition
2012-10-15T01:39:00.000Z	mrojas6996	TJ-	Wow thanks for replying so fast :D , but how i know what is the correct UUID to correct?
2012-10-15T01:41:00.000Z	mrojas6996		no no, i have Lubuntu 12.04 installed, but i had a 2nd SWAP partition that i delete with GParted in a LiveCD
2012-10-15T01:42:00.000Z	mrojas6996		sorry my english is experimental
2012-10-15T01:44:00.000Z	mrojas6996		the uuid of the deleted partition with gparted is in my fstab file, an i wanna to know how to update this file for the error diappears
2012-10-15T01:44:00.000Z	TJ-	mrojas6996	"sudo blkid  /dev/sda5" (if sda5 is the remaining swap partition)
2012-10-15T01:45:00.000Z	mrojas6996		I have Windows 7 with Lubuntu without a dedicated partition of /home
2012-10-15T01:51:00.000Z	mrojas6996	TJ-	and if I edit the FSTAB file and I delete the line of the inexistent "/dev/sda7", the error fixes?
2012-10-15T01:52:00.000Z	TJ-	mrojas6996	If the fstab refers to the swap partition by device-name, not UUID, you can correct the device name instead of using UUID. If you're unsure, pastebin the entire fstab for me
2012-10-15T01:53:00.000Z	mrojas6996		ok
2012-10-15T01:54:00.000Z	mrojas6996	TJ-	this is my FSTAB file http://pastebin.com/itT6Gs5Q
2012-10-15T01:55:00.000Z	mrojas6996		my partitions: Extended /dev/sda3 Lubuntu and Home /dev/sda5 the swap: /dev/sda6
2012-10-15T01:56:00.000Z	mrojas6996		the nonexistent partition would be /dev/sda7
2012-10-15T01:57:00.000Z	TJ-	mrojas6996	OK, thanks. Yes, you can delete the comment and its following line that refers to sda7
2012-10-15T01:57:00.000Z	mrojas6996	TJ-	Thank you So much! Muchisimas gracias!, me has ayudado enormemente :D
2012-10-15T01:57:00.000Z	TJ-	mrojas6996	lines beginning "#" are comments. The line that does it is "UUID=bd865ca8-3e96-43ca-8141-26ebccc55fbd ..."
2012-10-15T01:58:00.000Z	mrojas6996	TJ-	I delete the comment and the UUID
