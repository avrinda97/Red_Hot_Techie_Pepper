2006-05-31T16:33:00.000Z	soundray		Will there be a release party here or in -offtopic?
2006-05-31T16:34:00.000Z	soundray		Thanks
2006-05-31T05:41:00.000Z	soundray		Friends, do you have a suggestion for me? I'm running a program that displays sections from a 3D volume. When I run it locally, it works fine. When I try via VNC, the window and control panels are all visible, but the actual display area stays black. Is there a fix/workaround?
2006-05-31T05:42:00.000Z	scheuri	soundray	I am neither an expert, but...maybe vnc is not able to transmit 3D stuff? only 2D because of bitmapping?
2006-05-31T05:43:00.000Z	soundray	scheuri	yes, that's my guess too -- but is there perhaps a way to force VNC to show what's on the host? Even if it doesn't update as rapidly as the native host display?
2006-05-31T05:44:00.000Z	scheuri	soundray	I am using freenx all the time, so I am not much of a help, sorry
2006-05-31T05:44:00.000Z	soundray	scheuri	do you know of any freenx/OpenGL issues?
2006-05-31T05:45:00.000Z	soundray	scheuri	'coz I'll try freenx if there's any hope...
2006-05-31T05:45:00.000Z	scheuri	soundray	well, not really as I am only using it as 2D...but it might be worth a try
2006-05-31T05:45:00.000Z	scheuri	soundray	freenx is better anyway (as in speed and security)
2006-05-31T05:45:00.000Z	soundray	scheuri	thanks
2006-05-31T05:45:00.000Z	scheuri	soundray	welcome
2006-11-21T06:45:00.000Z	soundray	scheuri	Celldweller: please ask yourselves whether your conversation is still on topic. There's always #ubuntu-offtopic -- just in case...
2006-11-21T06:45:00.000Z	scheuri	soundray	aye, sorry
2006-11-22T17:50:00.000Z	soundray	scheuri	it doesn't say that. Base64 is just an encoding scheme, like uuencode
2007-03-24T12:02:00.000Z	scheuri	soundray	I am sorry...I thought you were talking localhost...is it a remote host?
2007-03-24T12:02:00.000Z	soundray	scheuri	no, his gnome is pausing after login. I though it was a localhost lookup problem, and we fixed hosts and hostname, but it still does the same thing.
2007-03-24T12:03:00.000Z	scheuri	soundray	and kingcobra: did you add sempron (which appeared your hostname) to the line of 127.0.0.1?
2007-03-24T12:03:00.000Z	soundray	scheuri	we tried that first, then we added it as a second line with the wireless interface IP
2007-03-24T12:04:00.000Z	scheuri	soundray	do not thank me to early here...;)
2007-03-24T12:04:00.000Z	soundray	scheuri	I'm hoping you're going to carry on after I log off and have dinner ;)
