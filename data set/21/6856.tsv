2011-08-25T16:12:00.000Z	xander		The offending file is http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates/ubuntu/pool/main/n/nvidia-graphics-drivers/nvidia-current_280.13-0ubuntu1~maverick~xup1_amd64.deb
2011-08-25T16:12:00.000Z	xander		I've tried manually with wget and axel but no luck with either
2011-08-25T16:12:00.000Z	xander		The error I get is "Connection failed"
2011-08-25T16:13:00.000Z	xander		"Please check your internet connection"
2011-08-25T16:13:00.000Z	xander		Yup.
2011-08-25T16:13:00.000Z	xander		Even axel gives up on this archive.
2011-08-25T16:15:00.000Z	xander		atalls->stalls
2011-08-25T16:15:00.000Z	xander		I can update my system but unfortunately that package is the latest nVIDIA driver, which is a crucial part of the update...
2011-08-25T16:16:00.000Z	xander		That's what troubles me. Why should wget or even axel stall midway on a package?
2011-08-25T16:17:00.000Z	xander		Anyone here can test download this package to see if it is not a connection problem at my ISP or somehing?
