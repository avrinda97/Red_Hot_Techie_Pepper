2007-10-23T13:24:00.000Z	eyeRmonkey		Question: When I run "avanat-window-navigator" I get this error: "bash: /usr/local/bin/avant-window-navigator: No such file or directory" ... I've tried removing and installing it again, but the error persists. What should i do?
2007-10-23T13:25:00.000Z	Ademan	eyeRmonkey	did you build it yourself?
2007-10-23T13:26:00.000Z	eyeRmonkey	Ademan	err. sort of. i downloaded it. then started doing awn curves. then gave up and ran "sudo make uninstall"
2007-10-23T13:29:00.000Z	eyeRmonkey	Ademan	is there any way for me remove the error about "avant-window-manager" not existing and just reinstall AWN from scratch?
2007-10-23T13:29:00.000Z	Ademan	eyeRmonkey	when exactly does the error occur? just when you try to run it or what?
2007-10-23T13:30:00.000Z	eyeRmonkey	Ademan	yep. all i do is try to run it from the terminal and it tells me "bash: /usr/local/bin/avant-window-navigator: No such file or directory"
2007-10-23T13:31:00.000Z	Ademan	eyeRmonkey	can you verify that the file in fact doesn't exist there?
2007-10-23T13:31:00.000Z	eyeRmonkey	Ademan	oddly, the only thing listed in "/usr/local/bin" is "awn-manager"
2007-10-23T13:32:00.000Z	Ademan	eyeRmonkey	have you installed anything else from source?
2007-10-23T13:32:00.000Z	Ademan	eyeRmonkey	if you haven't    eyeRmonkey: and generally you can do sudo rm -Rf /usr/local/*           will clear EVERYTHING you installed from source, which may be what you want right now
2007-10-23T13:33:00.000Z	eyeRmonkey	Ademan	Like i said, the one thing I started to install from source (and only got half way through the many different parts that needed compiling), I gave up and did "sudo make uninstall". Then I tried removing things from synaptic (that i installed using synaptic) and resintalling everyting from scratch from synaptic.
2007-10-23T13:34:00.000Z	Ademan	eyeRmonkey	well then i'd run the command i gave you, it should totally clear out avant window navigator, and leave you with a clean slate for things installed from source
2007-10-23T13:34:00.000Z	eyeRmonkey	Ademan	well i don't actually want to install AWN from source. they have a gutsy repo. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=385981 .... I did it from the repo originally, then messed it up. and now i can't get it back
2007-10-23T13:35:00.000Z	eyeRmonkey	Ademan	I did the command you gave. I'll go try installing it from the repo again
2007-10-23T13:35:00.000Z	Ademan	eyeRmonkey	good luck
2007-10-23T13:35:00.000Z	eyeRmonkey	Ademan	;) i'll need it. :D
2007-10-23T13:37:00.000Z	eyeRmonkey	Ademan	Sadly, i'm still getting that error when I run "avant-window-manager" ... this is silly. it thinks it's a command (it auto completes it for me) but then it goes to run ti can can't find it .... why is it even looking there for it as a command. it should be looking in a different /bin directory for it. shouldn't it?
2007-10-23T13:38:00.000Z	Ademan	eyeRmonkey	i don't know why it thinks it exists
2007-10-23T13:38:00.000Z	Ademan	eyeRmonkey	unless there's a link somewhere, for instance in /usr/bin
2007-10-23T13:39:00.000Z	Ademan	eyeRmonkey	you might try  this   find / -iname 'avant-window-manager'     and see if it shows you any locations
2007-10-23T13:39:00.000Z	eyeRmonkey	Ademan	good idea :)
