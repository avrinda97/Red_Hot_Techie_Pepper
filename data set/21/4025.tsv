2009-06-22T03:11:00.000Z	keri	thomc	i looked at my old computer and set it up the same way and still nothing
2009-06-22T03:11:00.000Z	thomc	keri	you've set up the accounts with the correct ports in the account settings?
2009-06-22T03:12:00.000Z	keri	thomc	the same as my old computer
2009-06-22T03:13:00.000Z	keri	thomc	i even took it off my computer and put it back on and tried it all over again and nothing
2009-06-22T03:13:00.000Z	thomc	keri	you said you had got it to work initially, or was that on your old computer?
2009-06-22T03:13:00.000Z	keri	thomc	on my new one worked 1 time
2009-06-22T03:13:00.000Z	keri	thomc	it received and sent and then did nothing
2009-06-22T03:14:00.000Z	thomc	keri	can you describe the problem a bit more specifically? do you get an error message when you try and check for new messages?
2009-06-22T03:14:00.000Z	keri	thomc	it just keeps scanning the smtp
2009-06-22T03:15:00.000Z	thomc	keri	you mean it just keeps checking for new messages with no success?
2009-06-22T03:16:00.000Z	keri	thomc	yes
2009-06-22T03:18:00.000Z	keri	thomc	when sending all it does is sending message says connecting to smtp.central.cox.net
2009-06-22T03:19:00.000Z	thomc	keri	so you can't send or receive? can you tell me how you've got it setup in Server Settings and Outgoing Server?
2009-06-22T03:20:00.000Z	keri	thomc	ok  pop.central.cox.net and smtp.centeral.cox.net
2009-06-22T03:23:00.000Z	thomc	keri	it's hard for me to know what the problem is because there are a number of things that could be causing it. This may be helpful: http://kb.mozillazine.org/Cannot_send_mail
2009-06-22T03:24:00.000Z	keri	thomc	i think it is working.  i sent e-mail to my gmail and replies and it worked both ways
2009-06-22T03:24:00.000Z	keri		hope i can get from other people too
2009-06-22T03:24:00.000Z	thomc	keri	good. It should work if you can send from one account to another.
2009-06-22T03:26:00.000Z	keri		   thomc: thank you/  i went in and relooked at the account and seen the problem
2009-06-22T03:26:00.000Z	thomc	keri	No problem.
