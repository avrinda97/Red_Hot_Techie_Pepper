2009-09-06T22:29:00.000Z	Nitrodist		I'm getting a slight stuttering in my audio player when I have my cpu usage at 100%, is there a way to increase the priority of my audio player's process?
2009-09-06T22:30:00.000Z	uga	Nitrodist	there's a command called "renice" for that on the cmd line
2009-09-06T22:31:00.000Z	uga	Nitrodist	for ex, "renice 10 foo", changes priority of process number foo to 10
2009-09-06T22:31:00.000Z	uga	Nitrodist	you can set smaller (higher) priorities, but only running as root
2009-09-06T22:32:00.000Z	Nitrodist	uga	can you read minds?  I'm changing foobar2k's process priority!
2009-09-06T22:32:00.000Z	uga	Nitrodist	hehe
2009-09-06T22:34:00.000Z	uga	Nitrodist	smaller=faster
2009-09-06T22:34:00.000Z	uga	Nitrodist	you can even set it down to negative numbers, if you are root
2009-09-06T22:35:00.000Z	uga	Nitrodist	numbers are from -20 to 19
2009-09-06T22:35:00.000Z	uga	Nitrodist	you can run the application with a given priority by using "nice" command too
2009-09-06T22:36:00.000Z	uga	Nitrodist	renice changes it once it's already running
2009-09-06T22:44:00.000Z	uga	Nitrodist	19 is the slowest possible nice level
2009-09-06T22:44:00.000Z	uga	Nitrodist	if you want higher priority, you need a renice -10 or something in that line
2009-09-06T22:44:00.000Z	uga	Nitrodist	ahk, heh
2009-09-06T22:46:00.000Z	uga	Nitrodist	btw, your "foobar2k" claims "Media player with simple UI and low memory use"
2009-09-06T22:46:00.000Z	uga	Nitrodist	in theory it should not need such renicing
2009-09-06T22:47:00.000Z	Nitrodist	uga	it's windows
2009-09-06T22:47:00.000Z	Nitrodist	uga	wine, in other words
2009-09-06T22:47:00.000Z	uga	Nitrodist	why not run something like amarok =)
2009-09-06T22:47:00.000Z	uga	Nitrodist	more than windows?
2009-09-06T22:48:00.000Z	uga	Nitrodist	sounds like you didn't use it or read its code before doing such claims
