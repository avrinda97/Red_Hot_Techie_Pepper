2007-08-05T06:25:00.000Z	larson9999		i've done this but i still the sun site still tells me java isn't installed.  what gives? "sudo aptitude install sun-java6-jre sun-java6-plugin sun-java6-fonts"
2007-08-05T06:26:00.000Z	easytiger_home	larson9999	dont install java from pkgs
2007-08-05T06:26:00.000Z	larson9999	easytiger_home	why not?
2007-08-05T06:26:00.000Z	easytiger_home	larson9999	just download the .bin java dist from java.sun.com and put a symlink to the .so in your browser's plugin dir
2007-08-05T06:27:00.000Z	easytiger_home	larson9999	i dunno. i've never used them. commercial s/w that is managed by apt is usually shit
2007-08-05T06:28:00.000Z	larson9999	easytiger_home	well, if the packages are broken i'm sure the good maintainers would want to fix them.
2007-08-05T06:29:00.000Z	easytiger_home	larson9999	sun java barely ever changes... might as well just install it once and forget about it
2007-08-05T06:30:00.000Z	easytiger_home	larson9999	and stick JAVA_HOME and PATH in your /etc/profile
2007-08-05T06:31:00.000Z	larson9999	easytiger_home	errr, i install it once for each version and once on each machine.
2007-08-05T06:31:00.000Z	easytiger_home	larson9999	each version?
2007-08-05T06:31:00.000Z	easytiger_home	larson9999	i know. but not in anyway you need to worry about
2007-08-05T06:32:00.000Z	larson9999	easytiger_home	and 1.4 before that and so on.
2007-08-05T06:32:00.000Z	easytiger_home	larson9999	why would you want to install those
2007-08-05T06:33:00.000Z	larson9999	easytiger_home	why would you want to assume what i'm installing?
2007-08-05T06:33:00.000Z	easytiger_home	larson9999	you just implied your installing multiple versions of java and that thus is the root of your problem,
2007-08-05T06:34:00.000Z	larson9999	easytiger_home	i didn't imply anything.  i said i installed java and show the command but get the browser tells me i need to install the jre
2007-08-05T06:35:00.000Z	easytiger_home	larson9999	because the plugin clearly didn't work. and i said link it by habd. installing the java plugin is literally just crreating a symbloic link
2007-08-05T06:46:00.000Z	larson9999	easytiger_home	like i said, i know how to install java manually.  i'm curious why installing via the packages didn't work.
2007-08-05T06:47:00.000Z	easytiger_home	larson9999	well file a bug and dont worry about it
2007-08-05T06:47:00.000Z	easytiger_home	larson9999	you tpyed it wrong
2007-08-05T06:47:00.000Z	larson9999	easytiger_home	if i determine it's not something goofy with my setup i will.
