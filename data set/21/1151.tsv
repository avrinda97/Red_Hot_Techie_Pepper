2011-04-08T06:45:00.000Z	mafoelffen		Still waiting for any response from anyone here...
2011-04-08T06:47:00.000Z	mafoelffen		Thanks.  Had installed Server 10.10 with Ubunut, Kubuntu and Xubuntu Desktops. CPU was misinstalled with wrong FSB. Reset to correct but now GUI's will not run.
2011-04-08T06:48:00.000Z	jrib	mafoelffen	what happens exactly when you say "GUI's will not run"?
2011-04-08T06:50:00.000Z	jrib	mafoelffen	create fresh new user, see if issue exists with new user
2011-04-08T07:00:00.000Z	mafoelffen	jrib	Same on new user.  Notice this on ubuntu-desktop... Xubuntu came up. Not really sure now on XFDE and Kubuntu, but know Ubuntu blank.
2011-04-08T07:02:00.000Z	jrib	mafoelffen	anything of interest in ~/.xsession-errors
2011-04-08T07:10:00.000Z	mafoelffen	jrib	Sory errors above.
2011-04-08T07:19:00.000Z	mafoelffen	jrib	xsession-errors-old error ed on parsing desktop-setup file, then downhill from there with orphaned references.
2011-04-08T07:19:00.000Z	jrib	mafoelffen	you should pastebin the file
2011-04-08T07:19:00.000Z	mafoelffen	jrib	to what pastebin?
2011-04-08T07:20:00.000Z	jrib	mafoelffen	doesn't matter.  paste.ubuntu.com if you want
2011-04-08T07:23:00.000Z	mafoelffen	jrib	paste.ubuntu.com/591065/
2011-04-08T07:25:00.000Z	jrib	mafoelffen	don't know
2011-04-08T07:27:00.000Z	mafoelffen	jrib	LMAO.  Only chnage on box... was running fine, but noticed CPU was misinstalled on mobo.  reset bus spedd from 100mhz to 133mhz where it should have been.. hten the probs.
2011-04-08T07:27:00.000Z	jrib	mafoelffen	it would be strange for that to be the cause
2011-04-08T07:28:00.000Z	jrib	mafoelffen	try and see if the problems go away (just to troubleshoot)
2011-04-08T07:38:00.000Z	mafoelffen	jrib	 No changed... Have a "cure" though.  This is a newly installed test box- less than 1 week seen install.  Will remove desktops, setup CPU correctly, then (re)install packages.  I don't really now how to re-install a package from the apt-get "command line".
2011-04-08T07:39:00.000Z	mafoelffen	jrib	Is there a reinstall flag for apt-get?
2011-04-08T07:40:00.000Z	jrib	mafoelffen	apt-get install --reinstall
2011-04-08T08:07:00.000Z	mafoelffen	jrib	Sorry/Same. Now removing. Then will install.  Should I purge?
2011-04-08T08:17:00.000Z	mafoelffen	jrib	Remove then install was a nogo. Ready to start all over and install again from fresh
