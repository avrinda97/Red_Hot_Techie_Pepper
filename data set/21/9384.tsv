2005-12-15T06:25:00.000Z	Ng	mmiikkee12	might it not be easier to install ubuntu-desktop and then just remove the bits you don't want?
2005-12-15T06:25:00.000Z	Ng	mmiikkee12	do you have synaptic? mark ubuntu-desktop for install and then remove the bits you don't want, *then* hit apply :)
2005-12-15T06:26:00.000Z	mmiikkee12	Ng	i don't have synaptic
2005-12-15T06:26:00.000Z	Ng	mmiikkee12	you sound like you need an install CD ;)
2005-12-15T07:24:00.000Z	Ng	mmiikkee12	fixed?
2005-12-15T07:25:00.000Z	mmiikkee12	Ng	yeah
2005-12-15T07:26:00.000Z	mmiikkee12	Ng	it's the fixed font, i didn't mean i fixed it :P
2005-12-15T07:26:00.000Z	Ng	mmiikkee12	yeah, I know
2005-12-15T07:26:00.000Z	Ng	mmiikkee12	I believe that's in xfonts-base
2005-12-15T07:27:00.000Z	mmiikkee12	Ng	installing that
2005-12-15T07:29:00.000Z	Ng	mmiikkee12	less install questions/options is better imho
2005-12-15T07:32:00.000Z	Ng	mmiikkee12	why are you installing x things if you did server?!
2005-12-15T07:33:00.000Z	mmiikkee12	Ng	i wanted a minimal install to add what i wanted to it, not what some ubuntu dev thought i wanted
2005-12-15T07:34:00.000Z	Ng	mmiikkee12	and then we have to help you get it working, great plan ;)
2005-12-15T07:34:00.000Z	mmiikkee12	Ng	if it worked perfectly we wouldn't need this channel ;)
2005-12-15T07:34:00.000Z	Ng	mmiikkee12	it works fine if you do a default install
2005-12-15T07:47:00.000Z	Ng	mmiikkee12	don't
2005-12-15T07:48:00.000Z	mmiikkee12	Ng	ok...
