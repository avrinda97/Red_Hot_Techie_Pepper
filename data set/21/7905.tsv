2007-06-05T16:55:00.000Z	killaz		damn why is this tv out such a hell always
2007-06-05T16:56:00.000Z	killaz		nv, nvidia thing is also a hell...
2007-06-05T16:58:00.000Z	killaz		I will be very glad if Ubuntu tries to deal with the nv,nvidia tv-out hell .....
2007-06-05T05:01:00.000Z	killaz		the bug is not a ubuntu issue, I agree. But why is it such a hell to make tv-out work. I mean I dont need to reconfigure my sound for example. Maybe I'm thinking to easy?!?
2007-06-05T05:02:00.000Z	killaz		I dont need to configure my monitor to work....
2007-06-05T05:02:00.000Z	CarlFK	killaz	is TV out = s-video ?
2007-06-05T05:03:00.000Z	CarlFK	killaz	kuz you didn't get it right the first time :)

2007-06-05T05:04:00.000Z	killaz	CarlFK	but I didnt need to get my monitor to work the first time....sorry I'm just frustrated. I mean I tried everything, configured many times to come to know it's just a bug.
2007-06-05T05:04:00.000Z	CarlFK	killaz	is TV out = s-video ?
2007-06-05T05:05:00.000Z	killaz	CarlFK	I dont get your question. Ae you asking if I have s-video? ues I have s-video....
2007-06-05T05:06:00.000Z	CarlFK	killaz	is tha tthe TV out you are tyring to get working?
2007-06-05T05:07:00.000Z	CarlFK	killaz	it might help if you didn't call it TV.  s-video is easier than TV.  TV generally implies modulation to a TV channel
2007-06-05T05:08:00.000Z	CarlFK	killaz	i was able to get my nvidia card to treat the vga and s-vid as sepearate monitors, and used TwinView to get the s-vid to work

2007-06-05T05:11:00.000Z	CarlFK	killaz	nvidia (i think...)
2007-06-05T05:12:00.000Z	killaz	CarlFK	lsmod | grep nvidia
