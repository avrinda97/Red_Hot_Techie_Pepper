2010-05-02T06:57:00.000Z	juanca		I've just upgraded to 10.04 and my wireless connection doesn't work anymore
2010-05-02T06:58:00.000Z	lmnopqrs	juanca	are you on a netbook?
2010-05-02T06:58:00.000Z	juanca	lmnopqrs	laptop, hp
2010-05-02T06:59:00.000Z	juanca		I've just upgraded to 10.04 and my wireless connection doesn't work anymore
2010-05-02T06:59:00.000Z	lmnopqrs	juanca	is your wireless sensing networks?
2010-05-02T07:00:00.000Z	juanca	lmnopqrs	how do I know that?
2010-05-02T07:00:00.000Z	lmnopqrs	juanca	if you click on your wifi symbol, does it see your network, and you  just can't login to it, or do you not see any networks at all
2010-05-02T07:01:00.000Z	juanca	lmnopqrs	I don't see any networks at all. The icon says the "wired" connection is off.. But I don't know how to change to "wireless"
2010-05-02T07:02:00.000Z	lmnopqrs	juanca	only thing i have to suggest is, try installing packages "bcmwl-kernel-source" and "patch". i had to do this with my hp netbook for a similar problem
2010-05-02T07:03:00.000Z	juanca	lmnopqrs	i did it for the 9.04... but now that I've upgraded from the alternate CD it doesn't work anymore... I've tried unistalling bcmwl-kernel-source, but it didn't work... therefore I don't have bcmwl-kernel-source in synaptic anymore
2010-05-02T07:04:00.000Z	lmnopqrs	juanca	i did it for 9.04 too but it screwed up again for me with 10.04. you can download the packages from packages.ubuntu.com, put them on a flash drive and move them to your laptop
2010-05-02T07:07:00.000Z	juanca		lmnopqrs:there's no bcmwl-kernel-source under "network", where should i look for it?
2010-05-02T07:08:00.000Z	lmnopqrs	juanca	i don't know what you mean by "under network", try searching for it at packages.ubuntu.com under "Search package directories"
2010-05-02T07:08:00.000Z	lmnopqrs	juanca	distribution lucid
2010-05-02T07:11:00.000Z	juanca	lmnopqrs	Ok, thank you, I have it, now how do I use it?
2010-05-02T07:11:00.000Z	lmnopqrs	juanca	your ubuntu system should recognize it as a gdebi file, just double click on it
2010-05-02T07:11:00.000Z	lmnopqrs	juanca	you may also need to get the package "patch"
2010-05-02T07:12:00.000Z	juanca	lmnopqrs	I got it from here: http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/bcmwl-kernel-source... where do i get "patch"?
2010-05-02T07:13:00.000Z	lmnopqrs	juanca	same place, just replace "bcmwl-kernel-source" with "patch". "patch" in this case is a specific program
2010-05-02T07:13:00.000Z	lmnopqrs	juanca	it was mysteriously missing from my install, which i discovered when i tried to install bcmwl-kernel-source
2010-05-02T07:14:00.000Z	juanca	lmnopqrs	ok, thank you very much, I'll try them now
