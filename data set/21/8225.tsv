2007-03-14T16:57:00.000Z	lkthomas		anyone try to setup hylafax before ?
2007-03-14T16:57:00.000Z	ikonia_	lkthomas	done it on solaris
2007-03-14T16:58:00.000Z	ikonia_	lkthomas	I never used a chroot
2007-03-14T16:58:00.000Z	ikonia_	lkthomas	no idea - check the config, I never needed to run hylafix in a chroot
2007-03-14T05:03:00.000Z	ikonia_	lkthomas	yup
2007-03-14T05:03:00.000Z	ikonia_	lkthomas	what part are you stuck on ?
2007-03-14T05:03:00.000Z	ikonia_	lkthomas	careful on the language
2007-03-14T05:04:00.000Z	ikonia_	lkthomas	ok so you don't want to chroot into that if its empty as there is nothing to launch from within there
2007-03-14T05:04:00.000Z	ikonia_	lkthomas	ahh thats ok then
2007-03-14T05:04:00.000Z	ikonia_	lkthomas	the devices are the "fax" devices
2007-03-14T05:04:00.000Z	ikonia_	lkthomas	although they normally differ from OS to OS so I'm surprised you got that
2007-03-14T05:07:00.000Z	ikonia_	lkthomas	you;ve not got a config file
2007-03-14T05:08:00.000Z	ikonia_	lkthomas	"its" and "you" - chrooting won't copy anything - you'll probably have to copy the files
2007-03-14T05:08:00.000Z	ikonia_	lkthomas	or create symlinks
2007-03-14T05:09:00.000Z	ikonia_	lkthomas	what file is it complaining is not found ?
2007-03-14T05:09:00.000Z	ikonia_	lkthomas	and where is that file ?
2007-03-14T05:10:00.000Z	ikonia_	lkthomas	whats in that file ?
2007-03-14T05:10:00.000Z	ikonia_	lkthomas	take a look ?
2007-03-14T05:11:00.000Z	ikonia_	lkthomas	I guess the key is to find where it expects that file to be
2007-03-14T05:12:00.000Z	ikonia_	lkthomas	what do you mean ?
2007-03-14T05:12:00.000Z	ikonia_	lkthomas	yes, you sound a little muddled
