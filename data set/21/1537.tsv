2010-08-04T10:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Octavio: what is the error you are getting and what is causing it?
2010-08-04T10:38:00.000Z	tesuji	ActionParsnip	i have been thru the broadcom run around myself today - despite what the docs say, there are not all the files you need on the livecd and it doesn't work
2010-08-04T10:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tesuji	I see
2010-08-04T10:41:00.000Z	tesuji	ActionParsnip	synaptic does list the kernel-source file for it, but when you go to install there are missing deps - basically, you either gotta have a wired connect or you have to figure out how to satisfy the deps manually and copy all those files to portable media - which means a wired wonnction.... :(
2010-08-04T11:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tesuji	highlight the kernel you want to edit and press e to edit it
2010-08-04T11:25:00.000Z	tesuji	ActionParsnip	i already got that far, now i need to alter it
2010-08-04T11:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tesuji	that's fine, add the boot options you need
2010-08-04T11:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tesuji	then press end and it will put the cursor at the end, are you troubleshooting the blackscreen at boot bug?
2010-08-04T11:27:00.000Z	tesuji	ActionParsnip	i know how to solve it, i just need to get the grub option in there
2010-08-04T11:28:00.000Z	tesuji	ActionParsnip	do i need to add a "--" to the end of the "linux" line?
2010-08-04T11:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tesuji	then go to the end of the line and type the option
2010-08-04T11:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tesuji	if the guide you have says you need -- then do it
2010-08-04T11:30:00.000Z	tesuji	ActionParsnip	apparently that wasn't the right way to do it :( :( it boots to a blank screen.  when i add that option to the end upon booting the livecd it works just fine
2010-08-04T11:30:00.000Z	tesuji	ActionParsnip	there is no guide, i am just going by the way the livecd works
2010-08-04T11:31:00.000Z	tesuji	ActionParsnip	that doesn't work for me i already tried it
2010-08-04T11:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tesuji	ok that's cool
2010-08-04T11:32:00.000Z	tesuji	ActionParsnip	my hardware is not the same
2010-08-04T11:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tesuji	try without the -- then, its free to try :)
2010-08-04T11:32:00.000Z	tesuji	ActionParsnip	when the grub boot options are all on one line then i know what to do but i am clueless with this menu, it does not work as expected
2010-08-04T11:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tesuji	could ask in #grub
2010-08-04T11:33:00.000Z	tesuji	ActionParsnip	well, yeah, when it boots halfway then my stick doesn't work anymore and i have to reload it from scratch.  i am beginning to think it is not possible to run ubuntu off a stick
