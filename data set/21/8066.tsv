2006-06-06T13:15:00.000Z	jbirdAngel	mwe	after that what else do i have to do to be using ubuntu instead of kubuntu
2006-06-06T13:15:00.000Z	mwe	jbirdAngel	well at next boot you can choose gnome at the login screen. to switch to gdm do sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm
2006-06-06T13:16:00.000Z	jbirdAngel	mwe	what does gdm stand for? and thats ubuntu instead of kubuntu and id just have to uninstall kubuntu?
2006-06-06T13:17:00.000Z	mwe	jbirdAngel	gdm is the gnome login manager
2006-06-06T13:17:00.000Z	mwe	jbirdAngel	you can keep using the kde one, kdm, though
2006-06-06T13:17:00.000Z	mwe	jbirdAngel	if you don't want to keep kde you can uninstall it yes
2006-06-06T13:18:00.000Z	jbirdAngel	mwe	, Flannel , and sladen thank you
2006-06-06T13:18:00.000Z	mwe	jbirdAngel	to remove kde sudo apt-get --purge remove kdelibs kdelibs-bin
2006-06-06T13:18:00.000Z	mwe	jbirdAngel	but you can keep both if you like
2006-06-06T13:19:00.000Z	jbirdAngel	mwe	okay thanks, and then it will be just as if i installed ubuntu from the disc?
2006-06-06T13:19:00.000Z	mwe	jbirdAngel	in case you decide to stay with kde after trying gnome
2006-06-06T13:19:00.000Z	jbirdAngel	mwe	ya thanks
