2011-02-28T11:50:00.000Z	Syria		Hi, where should I install Zimbra mail client? i mean in which folder?
2011-02-28T11:51:00.000Z	[thor]	Syria	did you download an installation .exe? a .deb? are you using the apt-get or Softwar center?
2011-02-28T11:51:00.000Z	Syria	[thor]	 There is a file called install.pl
2011-02-28T11:54:00.000Z	Syria	[thor]	There is a file called install.pl
2011-02-28T11:54:00.000Z	Syria	[thor]	I can choose the installation location but I don't know where it should be.
2011-02-28T11:55:00.000Z	[thor]	Syria	i'm sorry, i was looking at apt-get, and then zimba's own website for clues.
2011-02-28T11:55:00.000Z	Syria	[thor]	 Its okay, thnx.
2011-02-28T11:55:00.000Z	[thor]	Syria	you are installing the mail server?
2011-02-28T11:55:00.000Z	Syria	[thor]	 No, Just the mail client.
2011-02-28T11:57:00.000Z	[thor]	Syria	maybe http://wiki.zimbra.com/index.php?title=Zimbra_Desktop_2 will help
2011-02-28T11:58:00.000Z	Syria	[thor]	 Thank you very much, I will read it.
2011-02-28T11:58:00.000Z	Syria	[thor]	What is the default installation path in ubuntu linux?
2011-02-28T12:00:00.000Z	Syria	[thor]	 Thnx again.
2011-02-28T12:00:00.000Z	[thor]	Syria	i don't think there is a restriction on where you put it, as long as there is ample disk space. a safe place might be /usr/bin/ however the installation might drop several files/folders and i'm not certain how that in /usr/bin
2011-02-28T12:10:00.000Z	Syria	[thor]	 i have installed it in the usr/bin folder but I have i can't access the application icon on my desktop, i think its  a permissions thing.
2011-02-28T12:14:00.000Z	Syria	[thor]	did this happen after executing  install.pl for zimbra mail client?
2011-02-28T12:14:00.000Z	[thor]	Syria	yeah
2011-02-28T12:14:00.000Z	Syria	[thor]	 I had the same stupid issue!!!
2011-02-28T12:16:00.000Z	[thor]	Syria	i think the technical term for the state of our /usr/bin folders is FUBAR
2011-02-28T12:16:00.000Z	Syria	[thor]	 Next time execute the file user-install.pl only.
2011-02-28T12:18:00.000Z	[thor]	Syria	what i should have done was specify /usr/bin/mailerclient instead of /usr/bin
