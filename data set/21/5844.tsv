2008-05-04T10:23:00.000Z	ravi		nope, AP
2008-05-04T10:23:00.000Z	ravi		hey, anyone willing to help me with _my_ problem? just reinstalled Ubuntu using my old Home partition, whenever I install new programs, icons are not auto-updating in my menu.
2008-05-04T10:24:00.000Z	vocx	ravi	applications menu?  All that stuff is handled by some XML files located in various locations in your home folder or in /etc
2008-05-04T10:25:00.000Z	ravi	vocx	hmm... I know but how can I flush that stuff?
2008-05-04T10:25:00.000Z	ravi	vocx	seems it's conflicting with my old home partition
2008-05-04T10:26:00.000Z	vocx	ravi	I think you could delete the info on HOME since I guess it takes precedence over stuff in /etc
2008-05-04T10:27:00.000Z	ravi	vocx	ok... mind being a bit more specific as to what to delete?
2008-05-04T10:29:00.000Z	vocx	ravi	I can't tell exactly what to delete, but I'll search the GNOME desktop guides... let's see if I can find it.
2008-05-04T10:29:00.000Z	ravi	vocx	thanks, I'm not going to take cirkit's advice of rm ~/.*
2008-05-04T10:29:00.000Z	ravi	vocx	:)
2008-05-04T10:32:00.000Z	vocx	ravi	ha, well, I can't tell you _exactly_, but it must be some file mentioned here: http://library.gnome.org/admin/system-admin-guide/2.20/menustructure-0.html.en
2008-05-04T10:32:00.000Z	ravi	vocx	ok... hmm.
2008-05-04T10:35:00.000Z	vocx	ravi	basically, there is a bunch of ".config" and "applications.menu" files that control the application menu. I don't know how to reset it. I'm not an expert on this, but I want to learn this stuff also, since I wanted to customize my menus a little.
2008-05-04T10:55:00.000Z	vocx	ravi	wait! you fixed your menu problem? I can't scroll to read the solution.
2008-05-04T10:55:00.000Z	ravi	vocx	yeah, it seems it wasn't a global issue as I thought - stupid package I was installing wasn't putting in it's icons correctly in the post-install phase.
2008-05-04T10:55:00.000Z	ravi	vocx	go figure :P
2008-05-04T11:04:00.000Z	vocx	ravi	! it asks you for confirmation!
2008-05-04T11:04:00.000Z	ravi	vocx	I had a ball resting on enter :)
2008-05-04T11:04:00.000Z	ravi	vocx	came back 5 minutes later and my root partition was screwed
2008-05-04T11:05:00.000Z	ravi	vocx	I kind of knew there'd be errors since I had done something funky previously
2008-05-04T11:25:00.000Z	vocx	ravi	TuxPWNZ, liken Java but hating C#?  isn't that like saying "I like Ubuntu but Hate Kubuntu"
