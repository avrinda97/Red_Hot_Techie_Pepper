2010-05-21T20:11:00.000Z	dnivra	V-ille	right now I am on windows
2010-05-21T20:07:00.000Z	V-ille	dnivra	wired/wireless? and which ubuntu version?
2010-05-21T20:07:00.000Z	dnivra	V-ille	wired DSL in lucid.
2010-05-21T20:07:00.000Z	V-ille	dnivra	if it freezes, does "sudo service networking restart" help?
2010-05-21T20:08:00.000Z	dnivra	V-ille	networking works fine. it tries to connect to the DSL, fails and connects to LAN after that.
2010-05-21T20:08:00.000Z	V-ille	dnivra	LAN?
2010-05-21T20:09:00.000Z	V-ille	dnivra	so your ppoe connection fails?
2010-05-21T20:09:00.000Z	dnivra	V-ille	yeah in the sense that it connects to a private connection after that yes: i get an IP 192.168.1.2 thanks to my modem.
2010-05-21T20:10:00.000Z	dnivra	V-ille	any leads?
2010-05-21T20:11:00.000Z	V-ille	dnivra	other connections through the same modem work?
2010-05-21T20:11:00.000Z	dnivra	V-ille	I am using the same modem on windoze
2010-05-21T20:12:00.000Z	V-ille	dnivra	it's been a while since I last used pppoe, so no idea about its current status. All I can suggest is looking at the logs if the pppoe network scripts complain about something.
2010-05-21T20:13:00.000Z	dnivra	V-ille	logs of nm? or ppp daemon?
2010-05-21T20:13:00.000Z	V-ille	dnivra	I think the ppp daemon would be more useful
2010-05-21T20:13:00.000Z	V-ille	dnivra	nm probably thinks everything's fine :)
2010-05-21T20:14:00.000Z	dnivra	V-ille	so I need to setup ppp daemon and checks it's logs for failure.
2010-05-21T20:14:00.000Z	V-ille	dnivra	doesn't pppoeconf do exactly that?
2010-05-21T20:15:00.000Z	V-ille	dnivra	I mean, setup the daemon
2010-05-21T20:15:00.000Z	dnivra	V-ille	actually when I use pppoeconf it says "plugin compiled successfully" but doesn't connect. I know you don't have much of a clue like you already said. just saying though; it just doesn't connect to the DSL provider :(.
2010-05-21T20:16:00.000Z	V-ille	dnivra	can you do an ifup manually?
