2007-01-03T15:14:00.000Z	\lart		So, I've read over the (absurdly long) thread on the forums about disabling ipv6.  And I'm just curious - why kill a fly with a sledgehammer?  Seems pretty clear that it's an application config problem, and not the underlying OS, since simply disabling the ipv6 dns queries in FF makes the problem vanish...
2007-01-03T15:16:00.000Z	mwe	\lart	appearently there's a wiki explaining it which is not absurdly long ;)

2007-01-03T15:17:00.000Z	\lart	mwe	yes, that seems to be the sledgehammer method.  absolutely no need to blacklist ipv6 if you don't have v6 available.  just change the ff config so it doesn't do ipv6 dns lookups..
2007-01-03T15:18:00.000Z	mwe	\lart	um it explain how to disable ipv6 just in mozilla as well
2007-01-03T15:18:00.000Z	mwe	\lart	that works for firefox too
2007-01-03T15:18:00.000Z	\lart	mwe	yes, but the first part of the help tells you to kill ipv6 for the whole system.  do you not see that?
2007-01-03T15:18:00.000Z	mwe	\lart	I did
2007-01-03T15:19:00.000Z	mwe	\lart	the second method wont work for konqueror for example
2007-01-03T15:19:00.000Z	\lart	mwe	that sounds like an application problem again - not a system problem..
2007-01-03T15:20:00.000Z	mwe	\lart	if you don't need ipv6 why not just disable it to avoid the problems it can cause?
2007-01-03T15:20:00.000Z	\lart	mwe	why mess with the OS to mask an application config problem?
2007-01-03T15:21:00.000Z	\lart		Sounds like going to the doctor because you've got a broken finger, and he amputates your arm.  There, you don't have a broken finger any longer.
2007-01-03T15:21:00.000Z	mwe	\lart	IMO you don't "mess with the OS" by disabling ipv6
2007-01-03T15:22:00.000Z	\lart	mwe	disabling kernel modules is most certainly messing with the OS.
2007-01-03T15:22:00.000Z	mwe	\lart	can we agree that we don't agree? ;)
2007-01-03T15:23:00.000Z	\lart	mwe	clearly..  you go ahead making sweeping changes to the OS, I'll go on fixing application configurations. :)
2007-01-03T15:23:00.000Z	mwe	\lart	yeah I'll change linux operating system by not loading the ipv6 module
2007-01-03T15:25:00.000Z	\lart	mwe	clearly you have no understanding of the context.  You're making changes to the way the system loads its kernel.  That's not the same thing as modifying kernel sources, which you seem to be under the impression that I'm suggesting you're doing.
2007-01-03T15:25:00.000Z	\lart		best of luck.
2007-01-03T15:25:00.000Z	mwe	\lart	you were the one who said I would make "sweeping changes to the OS" ;)
