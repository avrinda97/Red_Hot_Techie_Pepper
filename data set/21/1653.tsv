2010-06-13T14:59:00.000Z	woot		no ideas?
2010-06-13T15:00:00.000Z	woot		i have got 2x RTL8111/8168B PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet controller and ubuntu loads the driver r8169 driverversion=2.3LK-NAPI, when i have both nic's up and running and transfer some data one of the both nic's goes down, could it be that it is only a driver problem ? and when yes, any idea's how to solve it ? or does anyone have experience with it?
2010-06-13T15:01:00.000Z	binaryme	woot	both connected to the same network?
2010-06-13T15:02:00.000Z	woot	binaryme	yes, want to have 2x1gbit connectivity
2010-06-13T15:02:00.000Z	binaryme	woot	why?
2010-06-13T15:04:00.000Z	binaryme	woot	it generally doesn't work like that.  two cards can't share the same ip
2010-06-13T15:04:00.000Z	woot	binaryme	i see that i have 2 ip's one per interface
2010-06-13T15:04:00.000Z	woot	binaryme	was my fault
2010-06-13T15:05:00.000Z	woot	binaryme	i just want some kind of 'link' that they both pull out the speed, i mean that i have 2gbit and not 2x1gbit
2010-06-13T15:06:00.000Z	binaryme	woot	you can have one ip per card, but my experience is generally not a goood it to be on the same network or subnet
2010-06-13T15:06:00.000Z	binaryme	woot	why do you need such a high speed cinnection?
2010-06-13T15:10:00.000Z	binaryme	woot	that would be like taking to freeways and directing all the traffic to a single lane highway..... roadblocks
2010-06-13T15:11:00.000Z	woot	binaryme	sure, i get that but how i said, it is not my thoughts on that :D
2010-06-13T15:12:00.000Z	binaryme	woot	are we talking about an off site link to the net>
2010-06-13T15:13:00.000Z	woot	binaryme	the nic's are both online, they both have online ip's (seperate) and are reachable or should be reachable from the outside
2010-06-13T15:18:00.000Z	binaryme	woot	that may be an issue, but I don't think it's the problem, if the cards work when you use the one at a time
2010-06-13T15:19:00.000Z	woot	binaryme	i just tested eth1 standalone, have to test the other one. when it goes down it needs around 5-6minutes till it comes back
2010-06-13T15:22:00.000Z	binaryme	woot	ok, if each card works ok, then it's probably a conflict because you are try to use two IPs on one subnet....  this won't work without special config or hardware
2010-06-13T15:23:00.000Z	woot	binaryme	okay, so i gotta try this out, the driver issue shall i fix it and when yes will there be trouble? i know my luck ;/
2010-06-13T15:25:00.000Z	binaryme	woot	regardless of the driver issue, tell you customer/employer? that they will need a dedicated dual WAN router to do what you are trying to do.
2010-06-13T15:26:00.000Z	binaryme	woot	you're welcome
