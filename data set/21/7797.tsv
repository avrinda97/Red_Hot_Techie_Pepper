2008-05-22T19:05:00.000Z	shingouz	Polarina	also check that you are in the audio group
2008-05-22T19:07:00.000Z	shingouz	Polarina	lsmod | grep snd should spit something out too
2008-05-22T19:07:00.000Z	Polarina	shingouz	I see snd_hda_intel
2008-05-22T19:08:00.000Z	shingouz	Polarina	looks like the alsa module is in there but i think it is a bit on the empty side. check what the mixer says, does it see anything?
2008-05-22T19:08:00.000Z	Polarina	shingouz	It's all unmuted, volume at the highest.
2008-05-22T19:09:00.000Z	shingouz	Polarina	and you are in the group "audio"?
2008-05-22T19:09:00.000Z	Polarina	shingouz	I triple checked.
2008-05-22T19:09:00.000Z	Polarina	shingouz	Yes, according to `groups`
2008-05-22T19:10:00.000Z	shingouz	Polarina	not sure how ububtu should do it but on my debian i can see a crapload of snd when i do a quick 'lsmod | grep snd'. things like snd, snd-pcm-oss, snd-pcm and others
2008-05-22T19:11:00.000Z	Polarina	shingouz	I phoned the place of purchase, they said that the drivers that ships with Ubuntu is out-of-date and had to compile ALSA by hand.
2008-05-22T19:11:00.000Z	shingouz	Polarina	ouch. what kind of system you run there?
2008-05-22T19:11:00.000Z	Polarina	shingouz	Laptop...
2008-05-22T19:12:00.000Z	shingouz	Polarina	a bit more would be helpful
2008-05-22T19:12:00.000Z	Polarina	shingouz	I can't find any newer version than 1.0.16 (which ships with Ubuntu 8.0.4) on their FTP site.
2008-05-22T19:12:00.000Z	Polarina	shingouz	Mitac.
2008-05-22T19:13:00.000Z	shingouz	Polarina	i see. but.... usually the modules come with the kernel, is that an ubuntu kernel you have there? 'uname -a'
2008-05-22T19:13:00.000Z	Polarina	shingouz	2.6.14-16-generic.
2008-05-22T19:14:00.000Z	Polarina	shingouz	It's a fresh installation from a Ubuntu 8.04 LTS live CD.
2008-05-22T19:14:00.000Z	shingouz	Polarina	on the other hand, if that is an OEM install, maybe calling the manufacturer would help. no idea if they have some strange things going on there
2008-05-22T19:14:00.000Z	Polarina	shingouz	I installed it myself.
