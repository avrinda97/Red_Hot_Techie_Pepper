2011-03-22T12:16:00.000Z	Starminn		If I pop open a Terminal, and run a file or programs or something, it has to stay open till I either force quit the application along with the Terminal, or I close the app. How do I open it without requiring Terminal the whole time too? For example, << gksudo nautilus >>
2011-03-22T12:16:00.000Z	Ben64	Starminn	go to the terminal, hit CTRL+Z, then type "bg", then you can exit the terminal
2011-03-22T12:17:00.000Z	Ben64	Starminn	or when you run a program, run it with & at the end
2011-03-22T12:19:00.000Z	Ben64	Starminn	err... "bg 1"
2011-03-22T12:20:00.000Z	Ben64	Starminn	otherwise the program woiuld probably be frozen
2011-03-22T12:21:00.000Z	Starminn	Ben64	No, no, no, I mean I run let's say << gksudo nautilus >>. I go to the Terminal, hit CTRL+Z, and it runs fine
2011-03-22T12:21:00.000Z	Ben64	Starminn	well thats cause nautilus is always running :)
2011-03-22T12:21:00.000Z	Starminn	Ben64	Ah. Good point.
2011-04-11T13:04:00.000Z	Starminn	Ben64	He has no control over that
2011-04-11T14:36:00.000Z	Starminn	Ben64	Not that I'm aware?
2012-01-06T15:02:00.000Z	Ben64	Starminn	what am i looking at?
2012-01-06T15:02:00.000Z	Starminn	Ben64	Nautilus "Home" folder
2012-01-06T15:03:00.000Z	Ben64	Starminn	yes... but whats wrong about it
2012-01-06T15:03:00.000Z	Starminn	Ben64	The colors are all wrong. I'm using the stock Ambiance theme.
2012-01-06T15:03:00.000Z	Ben64	Starminn	switch back to it anyway?

2012-01-06T15:06:00.000Z	Ben64	Starminn	have you tried switching it to something else, then back to ambiance?
2012-01-06T15:09:00.000Z	Ben64	Starminn	try installing gnome-tweak-tool and playing with the theming in there
2012-01-06T15:09:00.000Z	Starminn	Ben64	Umm.... That's what half the screenshot was of..
2012-01-06T15:10:00.000Z	Ben64	Starminn	so it is...
2012-01-06T15:17:00.000Z	Starminn	Ben64	nightshade209, I ran software updates and it fixed it. What broke it was an update from 2 hours ago
