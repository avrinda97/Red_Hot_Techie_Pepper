2011-12-07T02:06:00.000Z	jrib	compdoc	are you not familiar with the movie industry!?
2012-10-21T20:27:00.000Z	jrib	compdoc	1) does root have permission?  2) why are you even doing this?
2012-10-21T20:28:00.000Z	compdoc	jrib	I want to run Backup in Time (root) so I can backup a server. Im going to shut the server down and rebuild it, so I need to backup areas only root can access
2012-10-21T20:29:00.000Z	jrib	compdoc	I'm not familiar with Backup in Time, but why is nautilus involved?
2012-11-11T22:18:00.000Z	jrib	compdoc	umm, what's in your /etc/environment?
2012-11-11T22:20:00.000Z	compdoc	jrib	the proper path is there. the one sudo uses
2012-11-11T22:20:00.000Z	jrib	compdoc	grep PATH ~/.profile ~/.*bash* ~/.pam*
2012-11-11T22:23:00.000Z	compdoc	jrib	http://pastebin.com/E7UW3Z4d
2012-11-11T22:23:00.000Z	jrib	compdoc	what is your PATH?  echo $PATH
2012-11-11T22:24:00.000Z	jrib	compdoc	how did you login?
2012-11-11T22:25:00.000Z	compdoc	jrib	 ^
2012-11-11T22:26:00.000Z	jrib	compdoc	does the same thing happen if you use ssh?
2012-11-11T22:27:00.000Z	compdoc	jrib	hmm, the path is correct with ssh
2012-11-11T22:28:00.000Z	jrib	compdoc	hmm, which vnc server is this?
2012-11-11T22:33:00.000Z	jrib	compdoc	I'm not familiar with vnc4server, have you done any special configuration for it?
2012-11-11T22:34:00.000Z	jrib	compdoc	ok good luck.  You can always work around it of course by using ~/.profile.  But if you want to get to the bottom of the issue, I guess you have to investigate more
2012-11-11T22:34:00.000Z	compdoc	jrib	I can just add a path in ~/.profile?
2012-11-11T22:47:00.000Z	jrib	compdoc	sure, you can just define it there
2012-11-11T22:47:00.000Z	jrib	compdoc	assuming vnc4server likes /that/ file :)
2012-11-11T22:54:00.000Z	compdoc	jrib	this works: to .profile I added at the bottom:  PATH=$PATH:/sbin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/sbin; export PATH
