2005-02-04T14:00:00.000Z	smurfslay		hi there
2005-02-04T14:01:00.000Z	smurfslay		can anyone tell me, where i can find alsaconf on my ubuntu?
2005-02-04T14:02:00.000Z	LinuxJones	smurfslay	it was too buggy to install for Warty so it was left out.
2005-02-04T14:03:00.000Z	LinuxJones	smurfslay	if the installer doesn't work ....sadly by hand :(
2005-02-04T14:03:00.000Z	LinuxJones	smurfslay	you may just have to remove the oss modules for your soundcard from being loaded
2005-02-04T14:07:00.000Z	smurfslay	LinuxJones	can you tell me, what are the "basic" oss packages?
2005-02-04T14:08:00.000Z	LinuxJones	smurfslay	what kind of soundcard do you have ?
2005-02-04T14:11:00.000Z	LinuxJones	smurfslay	according to the hardware compatibility guide you whould be working already >> http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/HardwareSupportComponentsSoundCards/view?searchterm=sound
2005-02-04T14:12:00.000Z	LinuxJones	smurfslay	have you tried checking your volume controls and make sure nothing is muted or turned down ?
2005-02-04T14:13:00.000Z	smurfslay	LinuxJones	i can't adjust the volume.. if i go to the mixer i get the error, that no device is present
2005-02-04T14:14:00.000Z	LinuxJones	smurfslay	do lsmod | grep  intel8x0 and see if anything is listed
2005-02-04T14:15:00.000Z	smurfslay	LinuxJones	that looks goot
2005-02-04T14:15:00.000Z	LinuxJones	smurfslay	so you see  intel8x0 listed are the entries prefaced with "snd-" or not
2005-02-04T14:16:00.000Z	smurfslay	LinuxJones	just look at that nopaste link..
2005-02-04T14:16:00.000Z	LinuxJones	smurfslay	worry was watching tv :D
2005-02-04T14:17:00.000Z	LinuxJones	smurfslay	ok that seems to be correct. Try gstreamer-properties and select alsa
2005-02-04T14:19:00.000Z	smurfslay	LinuxJones	- i can select ALSA but if i use the testbutton, an error occurs:
2005-02-04T14:19:00.000Z	LinuxJones	smurfslay	are you doing that as regular user ?
2005-02-04T14:20:00.000Z	LinuxJones	smurfslay	try form your regular account
2005-02-04T14:21:00.000Z	smurfslay	LinuxJones	same errors
2005-02-04T14:22:00.000Z	LinuxJones	smurfslay	sorry I am out of ideas it outta be working. Maybe try logging out then back in again, I dunno :(
