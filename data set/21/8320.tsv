2006-09-05T07:35:00.000Z	mooky		whats peoples thoughts on using ubuntu as a small work group mail server ?
2006-09-05T07:35:00.000Z	mooky		I've not used ubuntu as a stable server before
2006-09-05T07:35:00.000Z	hondje	mooky	It should be fine
2006-09-05T07:36:00.000Z	mooky	hondje	yes, I'm sure it will be fine, curious how wide spread ubuntu server use is
2006-09-05T07:37:00.000Z	mooky	hondje	yes, thats my "concern" too
2006-09-05T07:37:00.000Z	hondje	mooky	I have one box running a testbed, nothing mission critical .... but the desktop is too unstable for me, it taints my opinion of the server 'version'
2006-09-05T07:38:00.000Z	mooky	hondje	I assume you've had very positive result with debian
2006-09-05T07:38:00.000Z	hondje	mooky	Generally. It's not perfect, but for what I tend to use it on it performs well with low maintenance work
2006-09-05T07:39:00.000Z	mooky	hondje	for a Maildir compliemtn mail service with webmail intergration would you say "debian would meet your requirments in a stable fashion"
2006-09-05T07:41:00.000Z	hondje	mooky	Novell makes it, web-based email, ical, all that stuff
2006-09-05T07:41:00.000Z	mooky	hondje	thank you for your feedback
2006-09-05T07:41:00.000Z	mooky	hondje	I'll probably go with postfix - just out of experience
2006-09-05T07:42:00.000Z	hondje	mooky	for bigger things I usually go with a real mta, but the web frontend is just so...friendly
2006-09-05T08:12:00.000Z	hondje	mooky	How OO.org and Firefox are hugely overrated :)
