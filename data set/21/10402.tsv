2005-03-12T15:17:00.000Z	klaxian		hello Ubuntu team
2005-03-12T15:18:00.000Z	klaxian		I've been giving Ubuntu to all my friends and family in my linux evangelism quest :)  but one has a problem that I haven't been able to figure out...can you help?
2005-03-12T15:19:00.000Z	geppy	klaxian	 I think we can answer that after we hear the question. =)
2005-03-12T15:19:00.000Z	geppy	klaxian	 It's probably just an old version, though.
2005-03-12T15:20:00.000Z	geppy	klaxian	 Are you behind a router?
2005-03-12T15:22:00.000Z	geppy	klaxian	 I don't see why they would.
2005-03-12T15:22:00.000Z	klaxian	geppy	any other ideas then?
2005-03-12T15:23:00.000Z	geppy	klaxian	 I'm sorry, but no.  I didn't get GTKGNutella to work, and, as it is greatly lacking in documentation, I just switched to AMule.
2005-03-12T15:24:00.000Z	geppy	klaxian	 It is not included in Warty, but you can get it from either universe, or multiverse, or something, and being that it's the only one that worked for me, it suits my purposes better.
2005-03-12T15:25:00.000Z	geppy	klaxian	 I personally prefer LimeWire, but it's an annoying corporate work, and it needs Java, so I don;t use it.
2005-03-12T15:25:00.000Z	geppy	klaxian	 Aye.
2005-03-12T15:26:00.000Z	geppy	klaxian	 Yes, on both counts.
2005-03-12T15:27:00.000Z	klaxian	geppy	thanks, is there something similar to testing in Debian?
2005-03-12T15:27:00.000Z	geppy	klaxian	 No, it's only Warty (stable), and Hoary (unstable)
2005-03-12T15:27:00.000Z	geppy	klaxian	 Sorry.
2005-03-12T15:28:00.000Z	geppy	klaxian	 That said, Hoary is "stable enough", if you don't mind breakage here and there.
2005-03-12T15:28:00.000Z	geppy	klaxian	 Then again, I wouldn't go giving it to your mom. =P
2005-03-12T15:28:00.000Z	geppy	klaxian	 Every day.
2005-03-12T15:28:00.000Z	geppy	klaxian	Yes. =)
2005-03-12T15:28:00.000Z	klaxian	geppy	thanks, you're a great help :)
2005-03-12T15:29:00.000Z	geppy	klaxian	 Thanks. =)
