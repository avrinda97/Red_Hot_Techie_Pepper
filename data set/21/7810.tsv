2006-10-08T16:16:00.000Z	SeraVitae	Gradius9	- im doing one now
2006-10-08T16:17:00.000Z	Gradius9	SeraVitae	ompaul , Just did the latest sysupdate. and now vnc server wont start so I have not a connection over vnc
2006-10-08T16:17:00.000Z	Gradius9	SeraVitae	ompaul , but smb and ssh still works so I can do thing in ssh
2006-10-08T16:18:00.000Z	Gradius9	SeraVitae	using the built in vnc server in dapper
2006-10-08T16:18:00.000Z	Gradius9	SeraVitae	Guess that is remote desktop
2006-10-08T16:20:00.000Z	Gradius9	SeraVitae	will do
2006-10-08T16:21:00.000Z	Gradius9	SeraVitae	I am pretty new to this, I get this
2006-10-08T16:22:00.000Z	Gradius9	SeraVitae	ON, I dont know how to turn it off in command
2006-10-08T16:22:00.000Z	Gradius9	SeraVitae	Any idea...
2006-10-08T16:22:00.000Z	SeraVitae	Gradius9	- go system -> preferences -> remote desktop and actually turn the remote desktop feature off
2006-10-08T16:23:00.000Z	Gradius9	SeraVitae	it is headless, only ssh connection... if I have to any physcial to the machine, I have to do it later
2006-10-08T16:25:00.000Z	Gradius9	SeraVitae	I has worked all the time, weird, think it was ssl updates.. that did this.
2006-10-08T16:25:00.000Z	SeraVitae	Gradius9	- well you can do vnc over ssl..
2006-10-08T16:26:00.000Z	Gradius9	SeraVitae	did not have it on, so it maybe set it on when I installed the updates.. going to check if my client support ssl vnc
2006-10-08T16:26:00.000Z	SeraVitae	Gradius9	- bring vino back up
2006-10-08T16:26:00.000Z	Gradius9	SeraVitae	just did it raw (internal net)
2006-10-08T16:29:00.000Z	Gradius9	SeraVitae	"<SeraVitae> Gradius9 - bring vino back up" how do I do this?
2006-10-08T16:30:00.000Z	Gradius9	SeraVitae	trying to find commands for the vnc server included now on google...
2006-10-08T16:38:00.000Z	Gradius9	SeraVitae	well i have to go, will be back later
