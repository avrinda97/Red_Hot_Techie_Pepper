2008-09-26T07:14:00.000Z	hitman1985		hi @ all, im runing hardy heron 8.04 and i got some network printer issues with a hp office jet
2008-09-26T07:15:00.000Z	crzyboi_Laptop	hitman1985	wat kind of issues?
2008-09-26T07:15:00.000Z	hitman1985	crzyboi_Laptop	i got actually 2 hp printers on my linksys wrt54g, one is an older 2600 series hp, and the newer officejet is the issue
2008-09-26T07:15:00.000Z	hitman1985	crzyboi_Laptop	i cant find it in auto detect mode
2008-09-26T07:16:00.000Z	crzyboi_Laptop	hitman1985	can you find it manually?
2008-09-26T07:17:00.000Z	hitman1985	crzyboi_Laptop	it doesnt even really show up as hp... on the router tho, just checked that :(
2008-09-26T07:17:00.000Z	crzyboi_Laptop	hitman1985	the older printer works fine tho right?
2008-09-26T07:17:00.000Z	hitman1985	crzyboi_Laptop	HP9F4E24 192.168.1.102 00-1b-78-9f-4e-24 Ethernet 
2008-09-26T07:17:00.000Z	crzyboi_Laptop	hitman1985	its not the router?
2008-09-26T07:17:00.000Z	hitman1985	crzyboi_Laptop	yep the older one works just fine
2008-09-26T07:18:00.000Z	hitman1985	crzyboi_Laptop	im guessign the new one has 102 in the end
2008-09-26T07:18:00.000Z	crzyboi_Laptop	hitman1985	so it isnt a router problem... did you follow the network printing instructions from the manual?
2008-09-26T07:19:00.000Z	hitman1985	crzyboi_Laptop	no manual :-( so i thought it might be just installing a driver or something like that
2008-09-26T07:19:00.000Z	crzyboi_Laptop	hitman1985	look up the latest drivers on hp's site
2008-09-26T07:19:00.000Z	hitman1985	crzyboi_Laptop	think i should give each pc on it a static ip ( one ip all the time the same ? )
2008-09-26T07:20:00.000Z	crzyboi_Laptop	hitman1985	yes... that way the computer knows exactly which one every time
2008-09-26T07:20:00.000Z	hitman1985	crzyboi_Laptop	wow i havent done that in a loooong time :(
2008-09-26T07:21:00.000Z	hitman1985	crzyboi_Laptop	on the linux i guess disable roaming mode ?\
2008-09-26T07:22:00.000Z	crzyboi_Laptop	hitman1985	ya
2008-09-26T07:22:00.000Z	hitman1985	crzyboi_Laptop	:) thank you. ima be right back i guess
