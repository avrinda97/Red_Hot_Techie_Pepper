2009-10-01T22:38:00.000Z	IonutB		hi. i'm using ubuntu 9.04 on x64. i have 4 GB Ram/800 MHz and a AMD x2 Dual core. My firefox is veeeeerrryyy slowwwwwwwww !? :|
2009-10-01T22:38:00.000Z	MaskedDriver	IonutB	install graphics drivers
2009-10-01T22:39:00.000Z	IonutB	MaskedDriver	it's installed already. i have normal visual effects
2009-10-01T22:39:00.000Z	MaskedDriver	IonutB	how is it slow? in what way? like opening? closing? browsing? creating new tabs?
2009-10-01T22:40:00.000Z	IonutB	MaskedDriver	when i run pages which contains Flash. I have 3 addons : AdBlock Plus, Firebug and Web Developer.
2009-10-01T22:40:00.000Z	MaskedDriver	IonutB	interesting
2009-10-01T22:41:00.000Z	IonutB	MaskedDriver	yes .. i really love the terminal but this problem makes me angry. i'm web developer  ... i can't use a "slow firefox"
2009-10-01T22:42:00.000Z	MaskedDriver	IonutB	I have like 20 addons on mine and it's fine... what type of flash plugin do you have? one by Adobe or one of the OpenSource variety?
2009-10-01T22:43:00.000Z	MaskedDriver	IonutB	try removing adblock and see if that improves performance.  Just start removing them to see which one is causing the slowdown
2009-10-01T22:43:00.000Z	MaskedDriver	IonutB	how did it run before you added your dev tools?
2009-10-01T22:47:00.000Z	IonutB	MaskedDriver	done. seems the same. i think there's a bug in Adobe Flash or something like that.
2009-10-01T22:48:00.000Z	MaskedDriver	IonutB	sehr interessant (very interesting in German).  Has your kernel updated recently?
2009-10-01T22:48:00.000Z	IonutB	MaskedDriver	yes, i have the last. Linux 0x 2.6.28-15-generic
2009-10-01T22:49:00.000Z	MaskedDriver	IonutB	I've had to reinstall all of my graphics after every kernel upgrade
2009-10-01T22:49:00.000Z	IonutB	MaskedDriver	mine was default installed :-)
2009-10-01T22:49:00.000Z	MaskedDriver	IonutB	what kind of card do you have?
2009-10-01T22:50:00.000Z	IonutB	MaskedDriver	i have the same problem ( slow firefox with flash bug ) on a laptop with intel x3100. ( the compiz was ok )
