2007-06-17T12:56:00.000Z	eduhat		hey guys, i need some help. im about to download ubuntu 7.04 and im on the part where i have to pick the type of computer i have. well its an AMD Athlon 4400+ 64 X2. so should i pick the 64BIT AMD or standard personal computer?
2007-06-17T12:57:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	eduhat	the 64BIT AMD since that is the processor that you had.
2007-06-17T12:58:00.000Z	eduhat	Megaqwerty	allright. will this OS be nicer to me than vista. vista is really really anoying. so im hoping that ubuntu will work better. i play counter strike and many so will ubuntu work for me?
2007-06-17T12:58:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	eduhat	yeah, I just double checked your processor use the 64Bit AMD iso
2007-06-17T12:58:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	eduhat	well, it would depend on if the games you play are compatible with a program in linux called "WINE" Counter-strike fortunately is one of them
2007-06-17T12:59:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	eduhat	if you give me a second, I will get you a guide on making it work in Ubuntu.
2007-06-17T12:59:00.000Z	eduhat	Megaqwerty	allright.

2007-06-17T13:05:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	eduhat	the only drawback to using ubuntu at this point in time is that some Windows games don't work on it, or it might take a little bit of work for them to install, since they were made for Windows, not Linux. Everything else however you will find is much better (in my opinion) than Windows, and to top it all off, you get great support (like what we're doing here) and just about ever thing is free.
2007-06-17T13:05:00.000Z	eduhat	Megaqwerty	allright thanks man
2007-06-17T13:05:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	eduhat	For gaming on linux, I'd also check out Cedega ( http://www.transgaming.com/ ) and you're welcome
2007-06-17T13:07:00.000Z	eduhat	Megaqwerty	is the cedega thing free?
2007-06-17T13:07:00.000Z	eduhat	Megaqwerty	seems really easy to use.
2007-06-17T13:08:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	eduhat	Yes and No. If you are willing to get it without support, and with a little extra work, you can get it for free. Otherwise, if you want it to be extremely easy to install with support from transgaming you will have to pay a small monthly fee
2007-06-17T13:08:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	eduhat	I also have a tutorial on doing it the free way if you wish.
2007-06-17T13:09:00.000Z	eduhat	Megaqwerty	can you provide me with that link to your tutorial. and how do i get it for free?
2007-06-17T13:10:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	eduhat	the tutorial explains how to get it for free: http://www.linux-gamers.net/modules/wiwimod/index.php?page=HOWTO+Cedega+CVS
2007-06-17T13:10:00.000Z	eduhat	Megaqwerty	oh okay :)
2007-06-17T13:13:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	eduhat	It looks like the best way to play games with cedega would be to get a subscription. (It costs around as much as a yearly Xbox Live subscription does)
2007-06-17T13:14:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	eduhat	more info here: http://transgaming.org/subscription/subscribe.html
2007-06-17T13:17:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	eduhat	I'm sorry if that was confusing for you :-\
