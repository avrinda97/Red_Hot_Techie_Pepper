2009-12-16T06:11:00.000Z	nohup		good evening all :)
2009-12-16T06:11:00.000Z	nohup		i just did an apt-get upgrade on my server.. and it updated my linux-image-2.6.28-17 package... after which it won't boot anymore ("error running install command for fuse")
2009-12-16T06:12:00.000Z	nohup		is this a known problem/bug ? and does anyone know how to fix it ?
2009-12-16T06:12:00.000Z	nohup		i can still boot using other kernels... but none of them support my hardware...
2009-12-16T06:12:00.000Z	nohup		i'd just like the kernel to boot again...
2009-12-16T06:13:00.000Z	nohup		yes, awesome..
2009-12-16T06:13:00.000Z	nohup		this server runs ubuntu
2009-12-16T06:13:00.000Z	nohup		not debian :)
2009-12-16T06:13:00.000Z	lazyPower	nohup	i'm not aware of this bug. And thats very strange, sorry to hear that.
2009-12-16T06:14:00.000Z	nohup	lazyPower	it kinda looks like something broke in the initrd image or something...
2009-12-16T06:14:00.000Z	nohup		sadly i don't think ubuntu keeps backups of those images before upgrading them... so i guess i'm screwed ?
2009-12-16T06:15:00.000Z	lazyPower		i wouldn't think you're screwed...
2009-12-16T06:15:00.000Z	lazyPower		can you boot a live cd and re-do the update?
2009-12-16T06:16:00.000Z	nohup	lazyPower	nope.. can't use any other boot device...
2009-12-16T06:16:00.000Z	nohup		it boots from an usb stick...
2009-12-16T06:16:00.000Z	lazyPower	nohup	then from what i tell, you very well may be. but i'm by no means a master. My dark voodoo only goes so far :P
2009-12-16T06:16:00.000Z	nohup		i have no cd/hdd or whatsoever in it.. but i CAN boot another image..
2009-12-16T06:17:00.000Z	lazyPower	nohup	right with zero hardware support right?
2009-12-16T06:17:00.000Z	nohup	lazyPower	hehe, not zero.. it just doesn't recognize the wifi... so i don't have internet :)
2009-12-16T06:17:00.000Z	nohup		well.. i can fiddle with that and get masquarade working through my laptop
2009-12-16T06:18:00.000Z	lazyPower	nohup	lol. well... what about a USB stick?cant you boot a live image from USB?
