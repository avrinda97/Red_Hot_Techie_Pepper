2008-12-18T19:27:00.000Z	jim_p		then?
2008-12-18T19:28:00.000Z	bahadunn	jim_p	I use debian everywhere else and freebsd
2008-12-18T19:18:00.000Z	jim_p	bahadunn	remove network manager. the word "useless" is too small to describe it. install wicd
2008-12-18T19:21:00.000Z	bahadunn	jim_p	ah okay
2008-12-18T19:22:00.000Z	bahadunn	jim_p	just aptitude purge network-manager or whatever?
2008-12-18T19:22:00.000Z	jim_p	bahadunn	are you on wired only?
2008-12-18T19:23:00.000Z	jim_p	bahadunn	your answer judges my anser to the 2st question
2008-12-18T19:24:00.000Z	bahadunn	jim_p	yes wired only
2008-12-18T19:25:00.000Z	bahadunn	jim_p	is wicd a replacement for network manager?
2008-12-18T19:25:00.000Z	jim_p	bahadunn	then you dont need a network manager or wicd! gnome network thing can handle wired perfectly
2008-12-18T19:25:00.000Z	bahadunn	jim_p	I use manual network config in /etc/network/interfaces
2008-12-18T19:25:00.000Z	bahadunn	jim_p	been using debian too long I guess
2008-12-18T19:26:00.000Z	jim_p	bahadunn	well since you already use the ultimate solution of network configuration, remove network manager! sudo apt-get autoremove network-manager
2008-12-18T19:27:00.000Z	bahadunn	jim_p	okay
2008-12-18T19:27:00.000Z	jim_p	bahadunn	and you fell from debian to ubuntu?
2008-12-18T19:27:00.000Z	bahadunn	jim_p	no
2008-12-18T19:27:00.000Z	bahadunn	jim_p	still use debian
2008-12-18T19:27:00.000Z	bahadunn	jim_p	I like ubuntu cause it gives me everything I want in a nice package for a desktop workstation
2008-12-18T19:28:00.000Z	jim_p	bahadunn	i hate that package! i want to put every app and configuration by myself and not let some stupid mechanism (eg network manager) take over
2008-12-18T19:29:00.000Z	bahadunn	jim_p	yeah I know what you mean
2008-12-18T19:35:00.000Z	bahadunn	jim_p	ubuntu is pretty nice besides network-manager though
