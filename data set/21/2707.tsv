2010-05-31T22:58:00.000Z	mkanyicy	ankush	well you need to be able to log into the system or even the console at least
2010-05-31T23:00:00.000Z	ankush	mkanyicy	ok..ill try rewrting the usb..do u know any easy way to make usb bootable for alternate diska?
2010-05-31T23:00:00.000Z	mkanyicy	ankush	not experienced with usb disks
