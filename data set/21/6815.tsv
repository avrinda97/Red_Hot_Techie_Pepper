2007-12-01T10:25:00.000Z	adamonline45	Assid	I was heavy into web developing, and wanted safari in its native environment...  And liked how it integrated so well in my linux network...  And just needed something different, if I was gonna get anyhting...  And then I wanted to get the faster one, and then more ram, and... yeah 8)  It's ok, it paid for itself, but I didn't use that money for it... sigh...
