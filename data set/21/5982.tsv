2007-07-10T07:56:00.000Z	macogw	RoC_MasterMind	and !es doesnt do anything...look what ubotu said
2007-07-10T07:56:00.000Z	macogw	RoC_MasterMind	i tried !ubuntu-es and you did !es and both times ubotu said "i dont know anything about...."
2007-07-10T07:57:00.000Z	RoC_MasterMind	macogw	because you need to put a > or | between the command and the person's name.

2007-07-10T09:41:00.000Z	macogw	RoC_MasterMind	no they dont
2007-07-10T09:41:00.000Z	macogw	RoC_MasterMind	it's $500-100 less for ubuntu
2007-07-10T09:41:00.000Z	macogw	RoC_MasterMind	$50-100 i mean
2007-07-10T09:42:00.000Z	macogw	RoC_MasterMind	 and windows costs them only  like $50 because they buy so much
2007-07-10T09:42:00.000Z	macogw	RoC_MasterMind	no they didnt
2007-07-10T09:42:00.000Z	macogw	RoC_MasterMind	i added it up and the ubuntu ones were all less
2007-07-10T09:42:00.000Z	macogw	RoC_MasterMind	there was 1 that looked more expensive
2007-07-10T09:42:00.000Z	macogw	RoC_MasterMind	but it turned out to have a MUCH better CPU than the windows one
2007-07-10T09:43:00.000Z	macogw	RoC_MasterMind	http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v472/macoafi/winbuntu.png for the Inspiron 530 price comparison
2007-07-10T09:59:00.000Z	macogw	RoC_MasterMind	i see where the windows ones would be cheaper. there are a few hardware freebies on the windows inspiron 1420 laptop
2007-07-10T10:00:00.000Z	macogw	RoC_MasterMind	on the desktops, ubuntu is cheaper and as to the other laptop, it no longer exists for windows
