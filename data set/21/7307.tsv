2008-11-14T22:53:00.000Z	norbert79	dob1	No issues... Works fine with FF 3.0.4
2008-11-14T22:53:00.000Z	norbert79	dob1	Make a screenshot
2008-11-14T22:57:00.000Z	dob1	norbert79	it doesn't appears in the screenshot, i don't think it's a firefox problem, but something different, i don't knwo
2008-11-14T22:57:00.000Z	dob1	norbert79	it's like a video problem then
2008-11-14T22:57:00.000Z	norbert79	dob1	A short look could help us a lot to understand your problem tough
2008-11-14T22:58:00.000Z	dob1	norbert79	i have to take a photo of the monitor, but i don't have a camera
2008-11-14T22:58:00.000Z	dob1	norbert79	no, you don't understand i did the screenshot
2008-11-14T22:58:00.000Z	norbert79	dob1	Ah, I see
2008-11-14T22:58:00.000Z	norbert79	dob1	So it's not visible on the screenshot
2008-11-14T22:59:00.000Z	dob1	norbert79	yes, this is why i think it's most a video problem
2008-11-14T22:59:00.000Z	norbert79	dob1	What videocard do you own? lspci as root
2008-11-14T23:00:00.000Z	dob1	norbert79	it's an nvidia 01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation NV25 [GeForce4 Ti 4200] (rev a3) , i disable the desktop effetcts with them i had problems on gvim too
2008-11-14T23:01:00.000Z	norbert79	dob1	Probably, try the official driver, not the legacy one... I don't know if the GF4 series needs the legacy driver by now
2008-11-14T23:02:00.000Z	dob1	norbert79	yes, i can't use the latest one, my video card is old
