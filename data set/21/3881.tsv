2008-09-04T07:01:00.000Z	Agent_bob		i have two questions, 1 why does starting xorg access the network ?    2 does this http://ubuntu.pastebin.us/?show=d1a58ee87 mean that the device is dead ?
2008-09-04T07:02:00.000Z	darjeeling	Agent_bob	do you use gnome?
2008-09-04T07:03:00.000Z	Agent_bob	darjeeling	no.  but i can.
2008-09-04T07:03:00.000Z	Agent_bob	darjeeling	i don't generally use a gui
2008-09-04T07:04:00.000Z	Agent_bob	darjeeling	but it's xorg not the de that is accessing the network   and that's why i asked
2008-09-04T07:18:00.000Z	darjeeling	Agent_bob	maybe startx -> start gnome -> gnome vfs or like that wanna connect network
2008-09-04T07:19:00.000Z	Agent_bob	darjeeling	?
2008-09-04T07:19:00.000Z	darjeeling	Agent_bob	answer for 1 question
2008-09-04T07:19:00.000Z	darjeeling	Agent_bob	and.. do you use block device? like raid
2008-09-04T07:19:00.000Z	darjeeling	Agent_bob	it may be broken
2008-09-04T07:20:00.000Z	Agent_bob	darjeeling	and Gnea starting xorg accesses the network  not starting things in xorg.    Xorg   and boom! the network lights flicker
2008-09-04T07:21:00.000Z	Agent_bob	darjeeling	block device like disk drives   yes i use block devices.
2008-09-04T07:21:00.000Z	darjeeling	Agent_bob	I think you have wrong configuration on block device maybe
2008-09-04T07:21:00.000Z	darjeeling	Agent_bob	or device driver has some problem
2008-09-04T07:22:00.000Z	Agent_bob	darjeeling	heh.  no configuration,   it's a mp3 player   and plugging it in yelds continual messages as pasted
