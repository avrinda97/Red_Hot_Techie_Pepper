2005-07-23T08:59:00.000Z	tritium	ksmurf	actually, you should look into update-rc.d
2005-07-23T09:00:00.000Z	tritium	ksmurf	see the manpage for update-rc.d on how to use it to add startup scripts

2005-10-02T11:32:00.000Z	tritium	ksmurf	heh.  Where was that again?  A hotel?
2005-10-31T12:55:00.000Z	tritium	ksmurf	that does not protect the wireless connection itself
2005-10-31T12:58:00.000Z	tritium	ksmurf	but how will you secure your network?
2005-10-31T13:05:00.000Z	tritium	ksmurf	sounds reasonable, given your constraints
