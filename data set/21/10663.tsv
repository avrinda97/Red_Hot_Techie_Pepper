2004-12-30T13:00:00.000Z	Dko		Hello could someone answer a newb question please?  Im trying to move files and folders around with the GUI (typing out commands is driving me insane.) But I don't seam to get a password so I can edit root folders/files which makes it impossible to do it thru the Gui.  What can I do?
2004-12-30T13:00:00.000Z	crimsun	Dko	FAQ. You use `sudo' with your _own_ passwd.
2005-01-02T17:39:00.000Z	crimsun	Dko	sec, lemme scroll up
2005-01-02T17:39:00.000Z	crimsun	Dko	are you running the command in a terminal?
2005-01-31T15:54:00.000Z	crimsun	Dko	it's normally a shell "builtin"
2005-01-31T15:54:00.000Z	crimsun	Dko	are you using a Csh-based shell?
2005-01-31T15:56:00.000Z	crimsun	Dko	err, you didn't have (weren't supposed) to install it; that was a question referencing which shell you are using when you get the ulimit error
2005-01-31T16:01:00.000Z	crimsun	Dko	`getent passwd $USER' should tell you the shell your user is configured to use by default
2005-01-31T16:02:00.000Z	crimsun	Dko	did you execute csh or tcsh at any time?
2005-01-31T16:03:00.000Z	crimsun	Dko	(and why are you attempting to execute your mud application as root?)
2005-01-31T16:06:00.000Z	crimsun	Dko	is that a mud daemon or a mud client?
2005-01-31T16:07:00.000Z	crimsun	Dko	daemon->server here
2005-01-31T16:13:00.000Z	crimsun	Dko	what mud daemon are you attempting to configure and execute?
2005-01-31T16:19:00.000Z	crimsun	Dko	I'm not familiar with it. Does their configuration/executing scheme require csh or tcsh? If so, you should direct your questions to them...
2005-01-31T11:55:00.000Z	crimsun	Dko	did you sort out your mud daemon issues?
2005-01-31T11:56:00.000Z	Dko	crimsun	No last night I went to bed to frustrated with it.  Was gona kill my computer. >_>
2005-01-31T11:57:00.000Z	Dko	crimsun	You know where I could go to get csh help like you said I should?  Can't seam to find much on it.
2005-01-31T11:58:00.000Z	crimsun	Dko	contact the developers of the mud daemon themselves, since it seems to be a local application-specific issue
2005-01-31T12:06:00.000Z	Dko	crimsun	Well it seams im a little screwed with the whole contacting the developer.  They kinda just posted this code on source forge and didn't leave a real E-mail.
2005-01-31T12:06:00.000Z	crimsun	Dko	surely within the tarball itself there exists a file with contact information?
2005-01-31T12:07:00.000Z	Dko	crimsun	Might of found something
