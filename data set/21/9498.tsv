2006-07-12T11:08:00.000Z	kakalto		hmm. which is better with a two-screen layout: big screen on left, or on right of small screen?
2006-07-12T11:08:00.000Z	kakalto		yah
2006-07-12T11:08:00.000Z	Flannel	kakalto	depends on your room setup etc.
2006-07-12T11:08:00.000Z	kakalto	Flannel	room setup doesn't matter
2006-10-09T15:34:00.000Z	Flannel	kakalto	there's a time/date section in sy
2006-10-09T15:35:00.000Z	Flannel	kakalto	time/date thing in system
2006-10-09T15:38:00.000Z	kakalto	Flannel	I mean from the CLI - I use ubuntu base, no GUI
2006-10-09T15:39:00.000Z	Flannel	kakalto	tzconfig I believe is what you want.  since you don't really want to change your system time, only your offset
2006-10-09T15:42:00.000Z	kakalto	Flannel	cheers
2006-10-09T15:42:00.000Z	kakalto	Flannel	but, if I'm on the edge, and I'm meant to end up @ GMT+13, what am I meant to do?
2006-10-09T15:43:00.000Z	Flannel	kakalto	There isn't a GMT+13?  or, maybe it's GMT+12 + DST
2006-10-09T15:54:00.000Z	kakalto	Flannel	dunno, looking
2008-06-20T12:06:00.000Z	Flannel	kakalto	You should use update manager
2008-06-20T12:06:00.000Z	kakalto	Flannel	mm, I'm trying; having a little trouble =]
2008-06-20T12:07:00.000Z	Flannel	kakalto	Alright, if update manager isnt working for you we can do it manually, yes.  Theres a few steps to be done before that though.
2008-06-20T12:08:00.000Z	kakalto	Flannel	Spudly, okay... Is there a webpage that just shows dapper --> Hardy upgrade, manual?
2008-06-20T12:10:00.000Z	Flannel	kakalto	Its pretty simple.  Make sure you have your kernel metapackage, ubuntu-standard, ubuntu-minimal, and any other metapackages (apache2, for instance) installed.  Make sure you're up to date with dapper (that includes dapper-updates).  Disable any third party repos (hopefully none, if there are, and if they are used heavily, you'll need to evaluate their effect on the upgrade).  then change dapper to hardy in sources.list, update, and dist-up
2008-06-20T12:11:00.000Z	Flannel	kakalto	Do you have a desktop metapackage as well?
2008-06-20T12:13:00.000Z	Flannel	kakalto	Again, if you do have a GUI on this (I thought you said server, but could be mistaken) make sure you have your proper *-desktop metapackage as ewll
2008-06-20T12:14:00.000Z	kakalto	Flannel	nah, not server - kubuntu, actually
2008-06-20T12:14:00.000Z	Flannel	kakalto	Ah, then make sure you have kubuntu-desktop installed as well.
