2011-03-13T07:31:00.000Z	ZombieRamen		i am aware that i must give details, Jordan_U
2011-03-13T07:31:00.000Z	ZombieRamen		however, if i give details, i get ignored, and i have to continually retype details
2011-03-13T07:31:00.000Z	ZombieRamen		thus, i ask if anyone is willing to help with my issue
2011-03-13T07:32:00.000Z	ZombieRamen		Audacity is refusing to interact in any way except through the menu bar
2011-03-13T07:32:00.000Z	ZombieRamen		so are you willing to help me, jordan?
2011-03-13T07:33:00.000Z	ZombieRamen		i have quite detailed information
2011-03-13T07:34:00.000Z	ZombieRamen		basically, audacity is refusing to interact except through the menu bar
2011-03-13T07:34:00.000Z	ZombieRamen		i cannot select any part of a track
2011-03-13T07:34:00.000Z	ZombieRamen		nor click any buttons
2011-03-13T07:34:00.000Z	ZombieRamen		but i can use the menu bar
2011-03-13T07:34:00.000Z	nit-wit	ZombieRamen	did it ever work?
2011-03-13T07:35:00.000Z	ZombieRamen		yes, it worked before yesterday
2011-03-13T07:35:00.000Z	nit-wit	ZombieRamen	any update/upgrades since then?
2011-03-13T07:35:00.000Z	ZombieRamen		i tried installing the daily alpha release, and got this output
2011-03-13T07:35:00.000Z	ZombieRamen		http://pastebin.com/8ZSL8SBX
2011-03-13T07:35:00.000Z	ZombieRamen		i'm not sure--the version i was using was from ubuntu 10.10's repos
2011-03-13T07:36:00.000Z	nit-wit	ZombieRamen	look in history in synaptic for any upgrades that might be the culprit
2011-03-13T07:37:00.000Z	nit-wit		yes
2011-03-13T07:39:00.000Z	ZombieRamen	nit-wit	I'm not seeing anything
2011-03-13T07:40:00.000Z	ZombieRamen		only thing relevant is ladspa-sdk, which has no impact whether installed or uninstalled
2011-03-13T07:40:00.000Z	nit-wit	ZombieRamen	that is about all I know, sorry
