2012-11-22T22:44:00.000Z	SunMoonStar		how do I have a program the rights to write a file to it's cwd if it lies in /usr/local/games/ ? It seems that applications can't write to there by default..
2012-11-22T22:46:00.000Z	SunMoonStar		Anyone know how to give a program the permission to write a file to /usr/local/games/mygame ?
2012-11-22T22:46:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	SunMoonStar	put it somewhere else?
2012-11-22T22:47:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	SunMoonStar	/usr/local/* is usually owned by root, so you should have no need to write there...
2012-11-22T22:48:00.000Z	SunMoonStar	TheLordOfTime	I searched and found the recommendation that I should put installed programs in /usr/local and larger programs in /opt
2012-11-22T22:48:00.000Z	SunMoonStar	TheLordOfTime	This game writes a savesettings file but it can't since that's a root one :o was it a bad recommendation?
2012-11-22T22:48:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	SunMoonStar	that's a general recommendation not a all-the-time recommendation
2012-11-22T22:49:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	SunMoonStar	in some cases that's not what you do, in your case try it in /opt
2012-11-22T22:49:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	SunMoonStar	if that doesn't work why not just run it out of your home direcotry
2012-11-22T22:50:00.000Z	SunMoonStar	TheLordOfTime	i dont want a lot of random programs' settings files cluttering up my home directory. Is /opt open to users or only root also? I need to abstract this to understand where I should put my programs
2012-11-22T22:50:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	SunMoonStar	which "game" are you trying to run?
2012-11-22T22:51:00.000Z	SunMoonStar	TheLordOfTime	It's called Lantern which is an interface for chess program ICC. It's not in the repositories
2012-11-22T22:51:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	SunMoonStar	run it from your home directory, that's the only way it can save data correctly.
2012-11-22T22:51:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	SunMoonStar	or try one of the other chess programs out there.  (not sure what Lantern is though)
2012-11-22T22:52:00.000Z	SunMoonStar	TheLordOfTime	my .bashrc seems to have a setting to include /home/bin if it exists. I don't know what 'bin' is in general, i assume it's binaries for custom programs that I developed. Do you think I should put it in there or should I put a separate /home/games directory or something?
2012-11-22T22:52:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	SunMoonStar	uh... what?
2012-11-22T22:53:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	SunMoonStar	/home/YOURUSERNAMEHERE/bin might be one place to put stuff
2012-11-22T22:53:00.000Z	SunMoonStar	TheLordOfTime	I mean, is */bin in general a location I should put programs? or is that only for developers
2012-11-22T22:54:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	SunMoonStar	its your system, run it from wherever you see fit.  I run half of my stuff on my servers as non-root, so...
2012-11-22T22:54:00.000Z	SunMoonStar	TheLordOfTime	thanks for the help
2012-11-22T22:55:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	SunMoonStar	i usually run stuff out of individual directories for each program out of my home dir.
