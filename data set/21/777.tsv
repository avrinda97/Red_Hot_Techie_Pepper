2011-06-16T22:24:00.000Z	shinobilord	Lasers	is 11.04 really that great. Looks buggy to me
2011-06-16T22:25:00.000Z	Lasers	shinobilord	I don't use Ubuntu personally. However, I like the dock on the left.  Accessing folders/applications is meh-meh.
2011-06-16T22:25:00.000Z	Lasers	shinobilord	Using icon/symbol is far effective than seeing text/names on panels, IMO.
2011-06-16T22:29:00.000Z	shinobilord	Lasers	I'd agree. I was referring to the fact that the desktop is really glitchy. Not at all stable. So why recommend it
2011-06-16T22:30:00.000Z	Lasers	shinobilord	Time-based releases. It have to come out.
2011-06-16T22:30:00.000Z	shinobilord	Lasers	sure. Until then even 10.10 is more stable
2011-06-16T22:31:00.000Z	Lasers	shinobilord	Why staying on 10.10 when you can stay on 10.04 LTS.
2011-06-16T22:32:00.000Z	Lasers	shinobilord	You can upgrade from 10.04 LTS (to the next LTS version).  If you went on 10.10 -- You'll have to go to 11.04 -- then the next version -- then the next version.
2011-06-16T22:35:00.000Z	shinobilord	Lasers	from that perspective I'd agree.but why not wait for the next major release before upgrading to 11.04 and then 11.10 (which would hopefully be better than 11.04)?
2011-06-16T22:37:00.000Z	Lasers	shinobilord	We're at 11.04. There are always first time for everything. We're experiencing our first time with Unity, hence the bugs. Minor or major. That's what LTS is for. It's for business and people who does not want to upgrade every six months. Think of the headaches IT administrators would have to go through with.
2011-06-16T22:43:00.000Z	shinobilord	Lasers	just saw one of ur posts. So instead of going through every release, I can just bounce from one LTS to the next LTS. Is that right?
2011-06-16T22:44:00.000Z	Lasers	shinobilord	Correct.
2011-06-16T22:45:00.000Z	Lasers	shinobilord	You would be upgrading every 2 years. That will work great for small businesses. :)
2011-06-16T22:46:00.000Z	shinobilord	Lasers	I'll have to seriously consider going back. The only problem is that I can get an official ppa for php 5.3.5 So I'm kind of stuck!
2011-06-16T22:47:00.000Z	shinobilord	Lasers	 I CAN'T get the ppa
2011-06-16T22:50:00.000Z	Lasers	shinobilord	Any reason why you can't use 5.3.2-1ubuntu4.9?
2011-06-16T22:53:00.000Z	shinobilord	Lasers	yeah, moodle require later than 5.3.2. See http://docs.moodle.org/20/en/Installing_Moodle
2011-06-16T22:55:00.000Z	Lasers	shinobilord	Ah. I don't know anything about php. It looks interesting. Learning environment. I guess you're using natty server with no GUI?
2011-06-16T22:56:00.000Z	shinobilord	Lasers	that's right. It's got an official version of 5.3.5 and I'm hoping the no-desktop version is more stable. No probs so far :)
2011-06-16T22:57:00.000Z	Lasers	shinobilord	:)
2011-06-16T23:03:00.000Z	shinobilord	Lasers	cheers :)
