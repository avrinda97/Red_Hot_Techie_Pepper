2008-09-04T05:23:00.000Z	Gnea	amt	you should install wubi instead of using the ubuntu iso.
2008-09-04T05:24:00.000Z	Gnea	amt	wubi will use ntloader instead of grub.
2008-09-04T05:25:00.000Z	amt	Gnea	I already installed ubuntu, would using wubi imply reinstalling it?
2008-09-04T05:26:00.000Z	Gnea	amt	you could go about this in a number of ways. as i understand it, and please correct me if i'm wrong, but for some reason, you would prefer to use ntloader rather than the default grub?
2008-09-04T05:28:00.000Z	Gnea	amt	you should ask in #windows then.
2008-09-04T05:29:00.000Z	Gnea	amt	there is no way that the displacement of an MBR would have any impact at all, whatsoever, upon the standby function of windows.  are you using a laptop?
2008-09-04T05:29:00.000Z	amt	Gnea	 yes, I am using a laptop
2008-09-04T05:30:00.000Z	Gnea	amt	which laptop?
2008-09-04T05:31:00.000Z	Gnea	amt	oooo, those are fun. now, how have you switched from windows to linux and vice versa? just by rebooting? or have you actually turned the system off all the way first, then powered it back on?
2008-09-04T05:31:00.000Z	amt	Gnea	I have successfully switchied from windows to linux and viceversa by rebooting
2008-09-04T05:32:00.000Z	Gnea	amt	okay, so you've warmbooted, but not coldbooted. please try coldbooting into windows and see if the standby still malfunctions.
2008-09-04T05:33:00.000Z	amt	Gnea	yes, ive booted into windows from the beginning (without rebooting), and the standby malfunctions there
2008-09-04T05:38:00.000Z	amt	Gnea	ive booted into windows from the beginning (without rebooting), and the standby malfunctions there
2008-09-04T06:26:00.000Z	Gnea	amt	i'm not sure what the problem is, exactly... you might have better luck by posting to ubuntuforums.org (make SURE you put the exact model number..)
2008-09-04T07:11:00.000Z	Gnea	amt	this is a new problem?
2008-09-04T07:11:00.000Z	amt	Gnea	well ive never tried the ethernet before, just wireless
2008-09-04T07:11:00.000Z	Gnea	amt	ah, if you type this:  ip l   do you see an eth0 listed?
2008-09-04T07:13:00.000Z	amt	Gnea	well, ill try it but il have to switch into ubuntu, i dont have wireless at the moment
2008-09-04T07:13:00.000Z	amt	Gnea	can you tell me what to do after that so I don't have to go back to windows again?
2008-09-04T07:14:00.000Z	Gnea	amt	check this out: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=25557
