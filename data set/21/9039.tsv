2005-12-08T17:44:00.000Z	Aven		hi
2005-12-08T17:44:00.000Z	Aven		how do I find out my root password?
2005-12-08T17:44:00.000Z	sethk	Aven	you don't find it out, you set it.
2005-12-08T17:44:00.000Z	Aven	sethk	how?
2005-12-08T17:45:00.000Z	sethk	Aven	sudo passwd
2005-12-22T10:22:00.000Z	sethk	Aven	about what?
2005-12-22T10:24:00.000Z	sethk	Aven	you really don't want to change the permissions on that file.
2005-12-22T10:24:00.000Z	sethk	Aven	why do you think you need to do that?
2005-12-22T10:24:00.000Z	sethk	Aven	what intelikey said, or boot a rescue cd (which is really the same thing)
2005-12-22T10:25:00.000Z	sethk	Aven	indeed, that's why you shouldn't have changed it in the first place.  :)
2005-12-22T10:25:00.000Z	sethk	Aven	in grub, do e, for edit
2005-12-22T10:27:00.000Z	sethk	Aven	what you stuff in your mouth when you are hungry
2005-12-22T10:27:00.000Z	Aven	sethk	shit?
2005-12-22T10:28:00.000Z	sethk	Aven	you've been having breakfast with my ex-wife?
2005-12-22T10:29:00.000Z	sethk	Aven	I'm not sure exactly what you are asking, but whatever it is, the answer is surely no.
2005-12-22T10:31:00.000Z	sethk	Aven	Actually, I think you may be able to do this:    sudo chown root:root /etc/sudoers
2005-12-22T10:31:00.000Z	sethk	Aven	(everyone close your ears) do su, and put in the root password
2005-12-22T10:32:00.000Z	sethk	Aven	single user or rescue cd boot are your options.
2005-12-22T10:32:00.000Z	sethk	Aven	or live cd boot, same thing
2005-12-22T10:32:00.000Z	sethk	Aven	download one
2005-12-22T10:32:00.000Z	sethk	Aven	or do this:   control-alt-f1    that should give you a login console.  login as root
