2008-03-29T07:51:00.000Z	amenado		Anaxite-> and you have a wireless connection? where is the result of iwlist
2008-03-29T07:52:00.000Z	Anaxite		iwlist requires multiple parameters; it's taking me time to get those
2008-03-29T07:52:00.000Z	amenado		charliko_-> ... free books  http://tldp.org/guides.html
2008-03-29T07:53:00.000Z	amenado		Anaxite-> my typo, i meant iwconfig
2008-03-29T07:53:00.000Z	amenado		Anaxite-> you have wireless connection right?
2008-03-29T07:55:00.000Z	amenado		xb3rt-> gconf-editor perhaps?
2008-03-29T07:55:00.000Z	Anaxite	amenado	iwconfig at http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/d7eeb67c4
2008-03-29T07:56:00.000Z	amenado		Anaxite-> you can ping 192.168.0.1 at all?
2008-03-29T07:57:00.000Z	Anaxite	amenado	Destination Host Unreachable
2008-03-29T07:57:00.000Z	amenado		Anaxite-> really?.. can you ping localhost? ping 127.0.0.1 ?
2008-03-29T07:58:00.000Z	Anaxite	amenado	Just tried that and yep - pinging localhost works fine.
2008-03-29T07:59:00.000Z	amenado	Anaxite	i'd reset and see if you can still ping localhost... to reset   /etc/init.d/networking restart
2008-03-29T08:00:00.000Z	Anaxite	amenado	Ok, ran that command. I can still ping localhost afterwards, and 192.168.0.1 is still unreachable
2008-03-29T08:01:00.000Z	amenado	Anaxite	and you still get same info as earlier when you do ifconfig; iwconfig; route -n ?
2008-03-29T08:02:00.000Z	Anaxite	amenado	Yes, although 'route -n' added a new line with a default of 169.254.0.0. So three lines now.
2008-03-29T08:02:00.000Z	amenado	Anaxite	thats okay , that 169.x.x.x is irrelevant..  how about your /etc/hosts  how does that look like?
2008-03-29T08:03:00.000Z	Anaxite	amenado	okay... 'cat /etc/hosts' yields two lines for the IPV4 section. "127.0.0.1 localhost" and "127.0.1.1 ubuntu"
2008-03-29T08:04:00.000Z	amenado		Anaxite-> and this still exist?  0.0.0.0   192.168.0.1     0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth1
2008-03-29T08:04:00.000Z	Anaxite		Yes, that still exists, amenado
2008-03-29T08:04:00.000Z	amenado	Anaxite	umm that dont look right  127.0.1.1 ubuntu   you can comment that with #
