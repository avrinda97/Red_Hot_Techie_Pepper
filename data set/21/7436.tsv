2006-12-28T11:21:00.000Z	eob84		I did apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5 mysql-server phpmyadmin, when I try to go to localhost/phpmyadmin it tries to download the page rather then loading in it... any help?
2006-12-28T11:22:00.000Z	dthacker	eob84	what do your apache logs tell you?
2006-12-28T11:25:00.000Z	dthacker	eob84	also, is your apache server running?  Do you get the apache test page at localhost?
2006-12-28T11:26:00.000Z	eob84	dthacker	yea
2006-12-28T11:27:00.000Z	dthacker	eob84	cool! now check your apache logs and see what the error is
2006-12-28T11:28:00.000Z	eob84	dthacker	php script is working got hello world to output
2006-12-28T11:31:00.000Z	eob84	dthacker	sorry to ask a lame question but do you know where the logs are located?
2006-12-28T11:31:00.000Z	dthacker	eob84	polite questions are not lame.  /var/log/apache or /var/log/apache2

2006-12-28T11:37:00.000Z	dthacker	eob84	I do not have apache installed on ubuntu, so I am not sure of the defaults.  Do you know your DocumentRoot?
2006-12-28T11:41:00.000Z	dthacker	eob84	on my non-ubuntu apache installation, DocRoot is /srv/www/htdocs.  phpmyadmin is located in /srv/www/htdocs/phpmyadmin.  Where is your phpmyadmin located?
2006-12-28T11:42:00.000Z	dthacker	eob84	un_operateur is on the right track
2006-12-28T11:43:00.000Z	dthacker	eob84	phpmyadmin works?

2006-12-28T11:44:00.000Z	eob84	dthacker	I've just been googling for a while
2006-12-28T11:44:00.000Z	eob84	dthacker	no I feel foolish lol, well thanx for trying to help me out
2006-12-28T11:45:00.000Z	dthacker	eob84	 good.  all's well that ends well.  Do a little poking in your apache config.  You'll have an easier time on the next install.
