2007-09-22T12:04:00.000Z	databoy2k		Hey all so is anyone here fairly decent with wifi connections and Feisty Fawn?
2007-09-22T12:04:00.000Z	pyr3	databoy2k	Do you know what your wifi card is?
2007-09-22T12:05:00.000Z	databoy2k	pyr3	it's a WMP54G running a RaLink RT61
2007-09-22T12:06:00.000Z	pyr3	databoy2k	What is the problem?
2007-09-22T12:07:00.000Z	databoy2k	pyr3	The network is unencrypted and should be easy to find and select, however even when the OS claims to be connected (even showing 4 out of 5 signal bars), I can't even ping my default gateway
2007-09-22T12:07:00.000Z	pyr3	databoy2k	run ifconfig and see if you have an ip address
2007-09-22T12:11:00.000Z	pyr3	databoy2k	I have no problems, but I'm running on a 5 year old PowerBook.... apple's original Airport card was based on the prism2 chipset which is widely understood and supported under linux
2007-09-22T12:12:00.000Z	pyr3	databoy2k	I don't know.  Sounds like the problem is related to dhcp and dhcp is one area where I'm fuzzy on linux.  There are about 3 different clients, but manually working them is something I don't know of f the top of my head
2007-09-22T12:12:00.000Z	pyr3	databoy2k	Have you tried manually setting an ip, etc?
2007-09-22T12:13:00.000Z	databoy2k	pyr3	yes... I followed an entire manual configuration guide - everything set until I got to the point where I defined my default gateway, and the terminal returned that it couldn't find the host on the network... sad considering the gw IS the network :P
2007-09-22T12:15:00.000Z	pyr3	databoy2k	I did find this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=132980
2007-09-22T12:16:00.000Z	databoy2k	pyr3	that's another one that I followed... the problem is that the FAQ there is for Breezy 5.10 and a few of the folders that it references have disappeared from feisty
2007-09-22T12:17:00.000Z	databoy2k	pyr3	/lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/net/, and this command $ sudo mkdir /etc/Wireless/RT61STA/ completely fails in feisty
2007-09-22T12:19:00.000Z	databoy2k	pyr3	i've read another FAQ that claimed that the thread you found simply doesn't work on feisty http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t-419709
2007-09-22T12:20:00.000Z	databoy2k	pyr3	that address again was http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=419709
2007-09-22T12:23:00.000Z	pyr3	databoy2k	This post is more related to Fiesty Fawn... http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=415693
2007-09-22T12:24:00.000Z	pyr3	databoy2k	how is your network setup?  Just the AP connected to dsl/cable modem?
2007-09-22T12:26:00.000Z	databoy2k	pyr3	Thanks for that link I'll try that in a bit... As for network setup I truly don't know - it's a service provided by my university for use in the dorms, and has been a bit of a nightmare. The system is an open network that when first accessed leads IE/Firefox to a login page... I assume that I can still use the same system in linux but maybe not ...?
2007-09-22T12:28:00.000Z	pyr3	databoy2k	is it possible that it uses PEEP/LEAP/whatever.  I'm not exactly sure what those are, but I think they wifi authentication methods.  Some UNis use them, and I've heard of troubles with linux and even getting osx working on them.
2007-09-22T12:29:00.000Z	databoy2k	pyr3	I know for a fact osx works great on it... i truly don't know it's a real nightmare either way... but even on windows before accessing the login page the server assigns me an IP address - you would think it would do the same for linux
2007-09-22T12:31:00.000Z	databoy2k	pyr3	thanks for all the help I'm going to try that last link... if it doesn't work then i'm going to hit the pit. Thanks man! Peace to everyone!
