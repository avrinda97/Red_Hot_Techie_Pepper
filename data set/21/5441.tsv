2007-10-13T13:37:00.000Z	Enselic	speedy__	depends on your card
2007-10-13T13:40:00.000Z	Enselic	speedy__	hmm it should be in monitor mode by default
2007-10-13T13:41:00.000Z	Enselic	speedy__	but anyway:   sudo iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
2007-10-13T13:41:00.000Z	Enselic	speedy__	oh sorry, right, it is managed by default. monitor is needed to set manuallly
2007-10-13T13:42:00.000Z	Enselic	speedy__	I gave you the comand, just fire up a terminal and type it
2007-10-13T13:44:00.000Z	Enselic	speedy__	please use the nick to the people you are talking to so that what you say is highigted in IRC
2007-10-13T13:45:00.000Z	speedy__	Enselic	i tried the command u gave me but it gave me an error
2007-10-13T13:45:00.000Z	Enselic	speedy__	ok, what did it say?
2007-10-13T13:46:00.000Z	Enselic	speedy__	no such interface I suspect?
2007-10-13T13:46:00.000Z	Enselic	speedy__	wlan0 was just a guess from my side, to find out the name of your interface, type   ifconfig   in a terminal
2007-10-13T13:46:00.000Z	speedy__	Enselic	Error for wireless request "Set Mode" (8B06)   SET failed on device ath0 ; Invalid argument.
2007-10-13T13:46:00.000Z	Enselic	speedy__	ah ok you did that alrady
2007-10-13T13:46:00.000Z	Enselic	speedy__	exactly what command did you use?
2007-10-13T13:47:00.000Z	speedy__	Enselic	sudo iwconfig ath0 mode monitor
2007-10-13T13:48:00.000Z	Enselic	speedy__	I think you need to bring the interface down first, did you try that?
2007-10-13T13:48:00.000Z	speedy__	Enselic	how do i do that?
2007-10-13T13:49:00.000Z	Enselic	speedy__	sudo ifconfig down ath0
2007-10-13T13:53:00.000Z	speedy__	Enselic	i tried it it didnt work but i did get a status and yes it is on managed mode
