2008-12-21T04:15:00.000Z	camerongroom	Brack101	how is that link supposed to help me
2008-12-21T04:16:00.000Z	Brack101	camerongroom	 You asked if it works with wine and the answer is no
2008-12-21T04:17:00.000Z	Brack101		hence the site I just sent you
2008-12-21T04:17:00.000Z	Brack101		appdb shows you whether or not stuff works with wine
2008-12-21T04:17:00.000Z	camerongroom		Brack101:It works with wine flash cs3 is on the silver list. but I'm saying when I try downloading it from Adobe.com the download manager is cranky and doesn't do anything.
2008-12-21T04:18:00.000Z	Brack101	camerongroom	yeah but you have cs4, that's different
2008-12-21T04:18:00.000Z	camerongroom		well there isn't a way to get cs3
2008-12-21T04:18:00.000Z	camerongroom		without a torrent now
2008-12-21T04:18:00.000Z	camerongroom		Adobe doesn't sell it anymreo
2008-12-21T04:19:00.000Z	camerongroom	Brack101	so you're saying if I find a flash cs3 I can run it on ubuntu?
2008-12-21T04:20:00.000Z	Brack101	camerongroom	no I was just showing you how to find out if stuff works in wine
2008-12-21T04:21:00.000Z	camerongroom	Brack101	alright but because it says it works with wine, then I can download a trial from a third party site and it should work with wine right?
