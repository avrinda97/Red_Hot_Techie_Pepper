2006-10-26T12:11:00.000Z	kubuntu		Can someone assist with a Mount issue?
2006-10-26T12:12:00.000Z	kubuntu		wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hdb, missing codepage or other error In some cases useful info is found in syslog - trydmesg | tail  or so
2006-10-26T12:12:00.000Z	ArrenLex	kubuntu	you're trying to mount the whole drive. You should be mounting a partition.
2006-10-26T12:13:00.000Z	kubuntu	ArrenLex	Sorry that should be /dev/hdb1
2006-10-26T12:13:00.000Z	ArrenLex	kubuntu	run sudo fdisk -l | grep hdb1
2006-10-26T12:14:00.000Z	ArrenLex	kubuntu	and the line "sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/hdb1 <mountpoint" doesn't work?
2006-10-26T12:15:00.000Z	kubuntu	ArrenLex	Gives me the same error as above
2006-10-26T12:15:00.000Z	ArrenLex	kubuntu	pastebin "dmesg | tail"
2006-10-26T12:20:00.000Z	kubuntu	ArrenLex	http://ubuntu.pastebin.ca/222315
2006-10-26T12:21:00.000Z	ArrenLex	kubuntu	this thing: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS
2006-10-26T12:21:00.000Z	ArrenLex	kubuntu	is toast
2006-10-26T12:21:00.000Z	ArrenLex	kubuntu	secifically: The Master File Table (MFT) essentially contains metadata about every file and directory on an NTFS file system. It includes parameters such as location, size, and permissions. It is used to aid in minimizing disk fragmentation.
2006-10-26T12:21:00.000Z	kubuntu	ArrenLex	Ah Ok can that be rebuilt?
2006-10-26T12:22:00.000Z	ArrenLex	kubuntu	does this partition mount under Windows? How did this happen -- did you try something dangerous like writing to it?
2006-10-26T12:22:00.000Z	kubuntu	ArrenLex	nope just tried moutning it
2006-10-26T12:23:00.000Z	ArrenLex	kubuntu	at this point, google is your best friend, because your problem has become very specific, easily described, specialised troubleshooting.
2006-10-26T12:23:00.000Z	kubuntu	ArrenLex	can some application (windows or other wise) repair this?
2006-10-26T12:23:00.000Z	ArrenLex	kubuntu	good luck :)
2006-10-26T12:23:00.000Z	kubuntu	ArrenLex	IE repair MFT NTFS ?
2006-10-26T12:24:00.000Z	ArrenLex	kubuntu	sure.
2006-10-26T12:45:00.000Z	kubuntu	ArrenLex	Screw it :) I'm running some processes on this till tomorrow I'll try and fix it after that
