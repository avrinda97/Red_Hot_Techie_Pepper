2010-08-23T22:34:00.000Z	cached		if i reinstall postgres from scratch, what happens to my existing databases?
2010-08-23T22:35:00.000Z	dot-slaSh	cached	backup first, always backup do a dump before anything and you can always restore it.
2010-08-23T22:52:00.000Z	dot-slaSh	cached	your looking for pgsql? yea it might be in /var/lib/
2010-08-23T22:55:00.000Z	cached	dot-slaSh	there is a /var/lib/postgresql
2010-08-23T22:55:00.000Z	dot-slaSh	cached	you're better off backing up with postgres dump first, you can also stop pgsql and then copy that directory but the dump is preferred
2010-08-23T22:56:00.000Z	cached	dot-slaSh	i can't run the server. it's broken =(
2010-08-23T22:56:00.000Z	dot-slaSh	cached	use this: pg_dumpall -U postgres > ${BUALL_FILE}
2010-08-23T22:56:00.000Z	dot-slaSh	cached	eewww
2010-08-23T22:57:00.000Z	dot-slaSh	cached	I guess having a backup of that /var/lib/pgsql/data/ would be next best thing but not a guarantee.....
2010-08-23T22:58:00.000Z	dot-slaSh	cached	I would cp -r /var/lib/pgsql/data/ /var/lib/pgsql/data.bak or somewhere else outside of that area and try to re-install pgsql-server
2010-08-23T22:58:00.000Z	cached	dot-slaSh	i'm going to backup off the server entirely in case something dies
2010-08-23T22:59:00.000Z	cached	dot-slaSh	but that's the plan
2010-08-23T22:59:00.000Z	dot-slaSh	cached	probably late now, but you had nothing for pd_dump running before this happend?
2010-08-23T23:00:00.000Z	dot-slaSh	cached	if you get this setup and restored, you should setup crontab job that does pg_dumps of the database(s)...
2010-08-23T23:02:00.000Z	dot-slaSh	cached	you know how to edit bash scripts?
2010-08-23T23:04:00.000Z	dot-slaSh	cached	Curious, you know how to edit bash scripts?
2010-08-23T23:05:00.000Z	cached	dot-slaSh	sure. why?
2010-08-23T23:05:00.000Z	dot-slaSh	cached	because I thought you could use this to help in the future, it could be better but it works for me.
2010-08-23T23:07:00.000Z	dot-slaSh	cached	as root I added that job to run to backup all the databases and also one database called fossology. it runs daily and should help if I need to restore =D
2010-08-23T23:08:00.000Z	cached	dot-slaSh	that looks like it does a complete backup every day? wouldn't diffing make more sense?
2010-08-23T23:09:00.000Z	dot-slaSh	cached	you can setup incrementals but our data is very very important so restore a complete backup makes more sense to me. Like I said it could be better but it works for me...
