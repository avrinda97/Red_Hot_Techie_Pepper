2005-01-20T06:47:00.000Z	SirFred	carlot	Are you using totem-gstreamer or totem-xine.
2005-01-20T06:47:00.000Z	SirFred	carlot	I'm not able to put totem-gstreamer to work properly, at least the one-week-ago version.
2005-01-20T06:47:00.000Z	carlot	SirFred	not sure
2005-01-20T06:47:00.000Z	SirFred	carlot	dpkg -l totem*
2005-01-20T06:48:00.000Z	carlot	SirFred	so what do you recommend?
2005-01-20T06:48:00.000Z	carlot	SirFred	just Totem?
2005-01-20T06:48:00.000Z	SirFred	carlot	No, for me the one that works is totem-xine.
2005-01-20T06:48:00.000Z	SirFred	carlot	Try installing totem-xine
2005-01-20T06:49:00.000Z	carlot	SirFred	OK I will right now, we are talking Warty of course?
2005-01-20T06:49:00.000Z	SirFred	carlot	Well, I'm using Hoary now, but I had this problem in my Warty days.
2005-01-20T06:50:00.000Z	carlot	SirFred	let me check and try will come back to you
2005-01-20T06:51:00.000Z	SirFred	carlot	OK. Good luck.
2005-01-20T06:51:00.000Z	carlot	SirFred	it was gstreamer installed, I am getting totem-xine now
2005-01-20T06:57:00.000Z	carlot	SirFred	it worked, thanks
2005-01-20T06:57:00.000Z	SirFred	carlot	np
2005-01-20T06:57:00.000Z	carlot	SirFred	what's the issue with gstreamer?
2005-01-20T06:57:00.000Z	SirFred	carlot	I'm not sure.
2005-01-20T06:58:00.000Z	carlot	SirFred	OK we will see
2005-01-20T06:58:00.000Z	SirFred	carlot	Perhaps the codecs you need are not supported, perhaps it's not stable enough.
2005-01-20T06:58:00.000Z	SirFred	carlot	But xine seems to do the work better by now.
2005-01-20T06:58:00.000Z	carlot	SirFred	will stick to that one till Hoary arrives...
