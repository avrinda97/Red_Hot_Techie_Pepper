2008-02-28T20:14:00.000Z	l815		is there a programming channel for linux?
2008-02-28T20:15:00.000Z	l815		do the conversion functions in c++ work in linux that work in windows?
2008-02-28T20:15:00.000Z	Slart	l815	afaik c++ is a standard.. as long as you stay away from the win32 api it should be the same
2008-02-28T20:16:00.000Z	l815	Slart	so things like atio() would work?
2008-02-28T20:16:00.000Z	Slart	l815	I would say yes
2008-02-28T20:16:00.000Z	l815	Slart	thanks
2008-02-28T20:17:00.000Z	Slart	l815	try anjuta... or a plain text editor.. emacs or vi if you like torturing yourself.. =)
2008-02-28T20:17:00.000Z	l815	Slart	haha okay I'll check them out
2008-03-13T02:23:00.000Z	Slart	l815	it might be driver specific.. it works on my laptop (acer travelmate 6291)
2008-03-13T02:24:00.000Z	l815	Slart	but what are some options for solutions? I mean I need the increased battery time at college
2008-03-13T02:25:00.000Z	Slart	l815	I have no idea really.. I didn't have to do anything to my laptop.. it all worked out of the box.. you can try testing different acpi settings.. google for ubuntu +laptop model... look for errors in dmesg and syslog.. it's all a bit touch and go
2008-03-13T02:26:00.000Z	l815	Slart	will do thanks
2008-03-13T02:26:00.000Z	Slart	l815	and of course.. ask the people in here if anyone has the same laptop that you have =)
2008-03-13T02:27:00.000Z	l815	Slart	oh good idea :D
2008-03-13T02:28:00.000Z	Slart	l815	here's one thread.. it's short.. but brings some hope =) http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=606829
2008-03-13T02:29:00.000Z	l815	Slart	lol i happened to stumble on the same site
2008-03-13T23:20:00.000Z	Slart	l815	no.. just in open office
2008-03-13T23:18:00.000Z	Slart	l815	all the fonts? or just some?.. you can play with the antialias settings in .. system, preferences, appearance I think
2008-03-13T23:19:00.000Z	Slart	l815	all the fonts? try deja vu
2008-03-13T23:20:00.000Z	l815	Slart	for system fonts?
