2010-08-28T12:13:00.000Z	p0pc0rn		i created a usb boot image with unetbootin on my FDE encrypted hard drive and now every time i go to boot up it is the boot screen for the .iso, not my hdd ubuntu install
2010-08-28T12:13:00.000Z	p0pc0rn		there's no cd
2010-08-28T12:14:00.000Z	p0pc0rn		im at the "boot:" prompt but i have full disk encryption. what do i do?
2010-08-28T12:15:00.000Z	sacarlson		FDE?  I would just install a standard ubuntu on your usb flash with unetbootin and add a user that has encrypted /home/user account.
