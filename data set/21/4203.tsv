2008-10-15T12:57:00.000Z	jim_p	error404notfound	your fstab is clean
2008-10-15T12:58:00.000Z	error404notfound	jim_p	yes.. but then what could be problem..
2008-10-15T12:58:00.000Z	error404notfound	jim_p	its still stuck there...
2008-10-15T12:58:00.000Z	jim_p	error404notfound	you can remove the "quiet" and "splash" options from the kernel booting line and check where it stops
2008-10-15T12:59:00.000Z	error404notfound	jim_p	okay...
2008-10-15T12:59:00.000Z	jim_p	error404notfound	or you can install bootchart and lose 30 minutes for a reboot so as to have it make a chart that shows the delays
2008-10-15T12:59:00.000Z	error404notfound	jim_p	sorry?
2008-10-15T13:01:00.000Z	jim_p	error404notfound	bootchart is an app that records to an image all activity done during boot. you will see tha image and figure out where the huge delay is. eg http://www.bootchart.org/images/bootchart.initial.png

2009-01-25T16:15:00.000Z	error404notfound	jim_p	thanks buddy, I really missed games after I started linux, warzone made me remember all of it..
2009-01-25T16:15:00.000Z	jim_p	error404notfound	and i want to add quake 3 or openarena to whatever the guys said
2009-01-25T16:16:00.000Z	error404notfound	jim_p	I hate quake and openarena type games :P, like AOE, WOW, or such games...:P
2009-01-25T16:18:00.000Z	jim_p	error404notfound	a long time ago i said "if you see me playing a strategy game, cut my hand from the wrist below." i just cant stand them. I played warcraft 3 once in my windows days and got my hero killed from the most worthless enemy :P
