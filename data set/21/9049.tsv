2005-11-22T16:26:00.000Z	xerox		phuzion, i dont think so
2005-11-22T16:26:00.000Z	cribeiro	xerox	are you interested in audio?
2005-11-22T16:27:00.000Z	cribeiro	xerox	I'm trying to find more people interested in audio support in Ubuntu :-)
2005-11-22T16:29:00.000Z	cribeiro	xerox	where are you from? I have two links to share, but one is in portuguese
2005-11-22T16:29:00.000Z	xerox	cribeiro	im in canada
2005-11-22T16:30:00.000Z	cribeiro	xerox	ok. I'm looking for better support for Sound Fonts and MIDI. but other stuff (sequencers, softsynths, low latency audio) are also of interest to me
2005-11-22T16:31:00.000Z	cribeiro	xerox	I had this problem with one particular Kernel version and one particular ASUS motherboard.
2005-11-22T16:31:00.000Z	cribeiro	xerox	now, for more audio stuff...could you check this? --> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OfficialSoftSynthSupport
2005-11-22T16:32:00.000Z	cribeiro	xerox	oops.
2005-11-22T16:32:00.000Z	cribeiro	xerox	do you have a "onboard" sound support or do you have a PCI soundcard?
2005-11-22T16:34:00.000Z	cribeiro	xerox	if you have a sound blaster you should have no problem, most of the time
2005-11-22T16:35:00.000Z	cribeiro	xerox	also, the output from lsmod is helpful
2005-11-22T16:36:00.000Z	cribeiro	xerox	well. isapnptools may be needed in order to recognize the ISA card
2005-11-22T16:36:00.000Z	cribeiro	xerox	ARE need, not MAY be needed
2005-11-22T16:38:00.000Z	cribeiro	xerox	which is the output of the lsmod command?
2005-11-22T16:38:00.000Z	cribeiro	xerox	there are a number of sound-related modules that must be present
2005-11-22T16:41:00.000Z	cribeiro	xerox	did you sudo it?
2005-11-22T16:45:00.000Z	cribeiro	xerox	sorry, I have to go.
