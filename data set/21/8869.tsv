2005-12-26T14:48:00.000Z	snotling		hello, who is the responsible (maintainers) for the 'multiverse' packages ?
2005-12-26T14:48:00.000Z	crimsun	snotling	we (MOTU) are.
2005-12-26T14:49:00.000Z	snotling	crimsun	so is it possible to ask tp 'update' a package ?
2005-12-26T14:49:00.000Z	crimsun	snotling	only in Dapper.
2005-12-26T14:50:00.000Z	snotling	crimsun	i see. is there a wishlist somewhere to ask for this ?
2005-12-26T14:51:00.000Z	crimsun	snotling	the ubuntu-motu mailing list, #ubuntu-motu, or the wiki for UniverseCandidates
2005-12-26T14:51:00.000Z	snotling	crimsun	thanks for the info, i'll have a look
2005-12-26T15:06:00.000Z	snotling	crimsun	i've read read the wiki you told me -> so what should I do ? send an email to the mailing list ? the package is already in breezy/dapper but at an old version
2005-12-26T15:06:00.000Z	crimsun	snotling	we don't touch breezy except for security/grave updates
2005-12-26T15:06:00.000Z	crimsun	snotling	dapper is feasible
2005-12-26T15:09:00.000Z	snotling	crimsun	ok so go for dapper. what is the next step to get this package ("gpac") updated ?
2005-12-26T15:11:00.000Z	crimsun	snotling	file a bug on malone for it
2005-12-26T15:12:00.000Z	snotling	crimsun	ok, cheers :-)
2005-12-26T15:18:00.000Z	snotling	crimsun	by the way, is it normal that my package is unknown on malone (but exists on packages.ubuntu.com for dapper of course) ?
2005-12-26T15:19:00.000Z	crimsun	snotling	you can ask for it to be added in #launchpad
2005-12-26T15:32:00.000Z	crimsun	snotling	as a heads up, we may not be doing anything with gpac in the near future (or we may depending on upstream's productivity), see the huge number of changes in http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/gpac/gpac/Changelog?rev=1.25&view=markup
2005-12-26T15:34:00.000Z	snotling	crimsun	do you mean you will wait for a 'stable' gpac release ?
2005-12-26T15:34:00.000Z	crimsun	snotling	if it's within a few weeks, yes
2005-12-26T15:35:00.000Z	snotling	crimsun	and if it's not ? couldn't you use the latest 0.4.0 release ? by the way, it may be a good idea to separate gpac and libgpac, as they seem to have done in BSD ports
2005-12-26T15:36:00.000Z	crimsun	snotling	what uses gpac as a lib that's in ubuntu's repo?
2005-12-26T15:38:00.000Z	snotling	crimsun	you must be right. i thought about this because now gpac can be used as a lib only to develop other software
