2005-01-01T17:19:00.000Z	Pozac	rwabel	yes?
2005-01-01T17:20:00.000Z	Pozac	rwabel	no, I think you just upgraded.. I had that problem too, not sure how I fixed it
2005-01-01T17:22:00.000Z	Pozac	rwabel	I managed to get it running by trying a few times and killing leftover processes in between
2005-01-01T17:23:00.000Z	Pozac	rwabel	do you use GDM? try startx
2005-01-01T17:24:00.000Z	Pozac	rwabel	I don't think I know then, sorry.. :(
2005-01-01T17:25:00.000Z	Pozac	rwabel	do that
2005-01-01T17:27:00.000Z	Pozac	rwabel	yeah - perhaps something in ~/.gconf ?
2005-01-01T17:30:00.000Z	Pozac	rwabel	and you can't click on anything, right?
2005-01-01T17:47:00.000Z	Pozac	rwabel	you can run 'gnome-session-save'
2005-01-01T17:48:00.000Z	Pozac	rwabel	I also have that option
2005-01-03T15:36:00.000Z	Pozac	rwabel	endless previewing?
2005-01-03T15:37:00.000Z	Pozac	rwabel	that doesn't sound familiar to me..
2005-01-03T15:38:00.000Z	Pozac	rwabel	I even messed around a bunch with it last night.. ended up with Human GTK+, Wasp Metacity and Human icons, really sweet :)
2005-01-03T15:41:00.000Z	Pozac	rwabel	ohh.. your own fault then :)
2005-01-03T15:42:00.000Z	Pozac	rwabel	did you logout and stuff?
