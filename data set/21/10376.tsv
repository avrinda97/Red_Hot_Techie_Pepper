2005-04-21T11:11:00.000Z	holy_cow		rofl, man when i first got to #debian, i had flame wars for two weeks before i got that it was standard practice over there
2005-04-21T11:12:00.000Z	holy_cow		i really wish ps users would just learn gimp, its far superior, and its ui is much better
2005-04-21T11:12:00.000Z	holy_cow		ps users complaining about gimp is like 3dsmax users complaining about maya
2005-04-21T11:12:00.000Z	holy_cow		its completely stupid, just learn the goddamned app
2005-04-21T11:14:00.000Z	holy_cow		it took 2 days to 'unlearn' ps
2005-04-21T11:15:00.000Z	holy_cow		and another 2 days to get some speed up, but at the end with gnome, debian and gimp
2005-04-21T11:15:00.000Z	holy_cow		with multiple desktops and amazing memory management of linux....
2005-04-21T11:15:00.000Z	holy_cow		i was at least twice as fast
2005-04-21T11:15:00.000Z	zenrox	holy_cow	 i agree
2005-04-21T11:16:00.000Z	holy_cow	zenrox	i had 1 gig large files, 1.5 gigs of ram on a 1ghz machine, not a blip
2005-04-21T11:17:00.000Z	zenrox	holy_cow	 i have had linux gnome gimp rendering a file in gimp on a 450mhz 128mb sys in 20 mins
2005-04-21T11:18:00.000Z	holy_cow	zenrox	heh, i find gimp an incredible piece of work, whenyou really get down to it, it is simply amazing, it stands up very well next to ps
2005-04-21T11:18:00.000Z	zenrox	holy_cow	 i todaly agree with the right hands (like a ps user) it can be very powerfull
2005-04-21T11:19:00.000Z	zenrox	holy_cow	 specaly when thay start writing scripts for it
2005-04-21T11:19:00.000Z	holy_cow	zenrox	oh god yes
2005-04-21T11:20:00.000Z	holy_cow	zenrox	i never realize how much i hate mdi until i used gimp, gimps non mdi ui is trully the right way to work, ESPECIALLY on a multimonitor, multidesktop setup
2005-04-21T11:22:00.000Z	zenrox	holy_cow	 yep its very nice and thare are just as good wallpapers made on linux for every other os out thare linux is even using .png as a pic format witch is a very powerfull format on any os
2005-04-21T11:22:00.000Z	holy_cow	zenrox	oh man absolutely
