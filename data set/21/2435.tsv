2009-10-16T03:25:00.000Z	Alex____		Does anyone have any ideas of a way to get several package files onto a computer that can't get internet? (Specifically ubuntu-restricted-extras, compizconfig-settings-manager, emerald, screenlets, vlc)
2009-10-16T03:27:00.000Z	pacifica	Alex____	you can download the debs then get them on a media that you can get into the computer without internet
2009-10-16T03:27:00.000Z	pacifica	Alex____	the only "problem" is you need to make sure you include all the dependencies...
2009-10-16T03:28:00.000Z	Alex____	pacifica	I figured that much, my problem is trying to GET the package files to be able to transfer them... Someone suggested Apt-on-CD but it only got things from the update manager... none of my personal downloaded packaged
2009-10-16T03:28:00.000Z	pacifica	Alex____	the site http://packages.ubuntu.com/ lists the dependencies for each package
2009-10-16T03:29:00.000Z	Alex____	pacifica	But where can I go to actually get the package files to transfer them?
2009-10-16T03:29:00.000Z	pacifica	Alex____	for instance take this one:
2009-10-16T03:29:00.000Z	pacifica	Alex____	http://cz.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/a/adduser/adduser_3.110ubuntu5_all.deb
2009-10-16T03:29:00.000Z	pacifica	Alex____	use "wget" on the Linux commandline to get the deb
2009-10-16T03:30:00.000Z	pacifica	Alex____	or use a web browser to download it.
2009-10-16T03:31:00.000Z	Alex____	pacifica	But how can I find out the web address for the specific package file? all I know is it's name, eg. ubuntu-restricted-extras
2009-10-16T03:39:00.000Z	pacifica	Alex____	just browse http://packages.ubuntu.com
2009-10-16T03:40:00.000Z	pacifica	Alex____	if you search there for ubuntu-restricted-extras
2009-10-16T03:40:00.000Z	pacifica	Alex____	you'll get http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=ubuntu-restricted-extras&searchon=names&suite=jaunty&section=all
2009-10-16T03:40:00.000Z	pacifica	Alex____	then click on "jaunty" (for instance)
2009-10-16T03:41:00.000Z	Alex____	pacifica	I see. I thought you were somehow trying to do like sudo wget ubuntu-restricted-extras and I wasn't following lol
2009-10-16T03:41:00.000Z	pacifica	Alex____	then right click one of the mirrors and choose Copy Link Location
2009-10-16T03:41:00.000Z	pacifica	Alex____	then paste that after "wget"
2009-10-16T03:42:00.000Z	pacifica	Alex____	this needs to be like this since you might be downloading for a completely different version of Ubuntu
2009-10-16T03:43:00.000Z	Alex____	pacifica	I just hadn't noticed that you could download the debs off packages.ubuntu.com
2009-10-16T03:43:00.000Z	pacifica	Alex____	there you go :-)
