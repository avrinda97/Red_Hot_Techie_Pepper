2011-02-05T14:58:00.000Z	rafaa		Hi, I have a Bash script which updates a text file. When I run it by hand it works, but if it's executed by cron it doesn't work
2011-02-05T14:58:00.000Z	rafaa		can anybody help me? [BASH] [CRON]

2011-02-05T15:01:00.000Z	greppy	rafaa	specify the full path to iwconfig, grep, cut and cat, or specify a PATH environment variable that includes the paths to those programs.
2011-02-05T15:02:00.000Z	rafaa	greppy	why am I supposed to do like this? These are standard executables. Doesn't cron set the defaut $PATH?
2011-02-05T15:03:00.000Z	greppy	rafaa	no.
2011-02-05T15:03:00.000Z	rafaa	greppy	but if I set PATH in the script, then cron will use it, right?
2011-02-05T15:03:00.000Z	greppy	rafaa	the script will use it, cron won't care :)
2011-02-05T15:03:00.000Z	rafaa	greppy	ok :D
2011-02-05T15:04:00.000Z	rafaa	greppy	do you know how can I plot the results with gnuplot?
2011-02-05T15:04:00.000Z	greppy	rafaa	nope
2011-02-05T15:04:00.000Z	rafaa		ok :D thx anyway
2011-02-05T15:04:00.000Z	rafaa		n3rv3 it's a text file
2011-02-05T15:05:00.000Z	rafaa		each line contains a number in [0:99]
2011-02-05T15:05:00.000Z	rafaa		it's the wifi signal measure during day, n3rv3
2011-02-05T15:05:00.000Z	rafaa		if I do something like gnuplot> plot "wifi.dat" I don't get the right plot
2011-02-05T15:06:00.000Z	greppy	rafaa	to plot it, wouldn't you also need a timestamp?
2011-02-05T15:06:00.000Z	rafaa	greppy	I don't know gnuplot :D I think that if you have a single column you should interpret it like a historical series
2011-02-05T15:07:00.000Z	greppy	rafaa	I don't know gnuplot either, so good luck :)
2011-02-05T15:07:00.000Z	rafaa		(I don't know how you call it, in Italy we say "serie storica"
2011-02-05T15:07:00.000Z	rafaa	greppy	ok :D
