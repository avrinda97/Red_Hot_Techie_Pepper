2009-02-10T12:34:00.000Z	Myrtti	IdleOne	they use netmeeting
2009-02-10T12:35:00.000Z	IdleOne	Myrtti	Flannel any links to how I would get the connection setup so I can explain it or atleast show them?
2009-02-10T12:38:00.000Z	IdleOne	Myrtti	FYI in case you did not know there is a ekiga for windows it is beta but I will try and get them to install it.
