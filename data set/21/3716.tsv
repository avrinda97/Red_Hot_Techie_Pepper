2008-10-20T14:06:00.000Z	kuthux	ActionParsnip	don't send it to me
2008-10-20T14:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kuthux	yeah sorry man
2008-10-20T14:40:00.000Z	kuthux	ActionParsnip	then what
2008-10-20T14:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kuthux	i just hate wubi
2008-10-20T14:40:00.000Z	kuthux	ActionParsnip	i'm not looking for wubi, but that kind of stuff for mac
2008-10-20T14:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kuthux	virtualbox / vmware
2008-10-20T14:41:00.000Z	kuthux	ActionParsnip	no, not virtual
2008-10-20T14:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kuthux	what do you think wubi is?
2008-10-20T14:42:00.000Z	kuthux	ActionParsnip	yes, but wubi is not like vmware. we can boot directly to installed ubuntu. only the partition is virtual
2008-10-20T14:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kuthux	i have no idea, im not a mac guuy or wubi guy. i dislike both
2008-10-20T14:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kuthux	its not an ubuntu question, its a mac question
2008-10-20T14:44:00.000Z	kuthux	ActionParsnip	a person who is trying to install ubuntu on his mac. is it OOT ?
2008-10-20T14:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kuthux	you want a piece of mac softwrae to run ubuntu as wubi afaik is windows only
2008-10-20T14:45:00.000Z	kuthux	ActionParsnip	this man wants o install ubuntu, and he has only the iso file. so now what?
2008-10-20T14:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kuthux	md5 check it and burn it to cd
2008-10-20T14:46:00.000Z	kuthux	ActionParsnip	i wouldn't ask u if he could do that
2008-10-20T14:49:00.000Z	kuthux	ActionParsnip	http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/8700/
2008-10-20T14:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kuthux	i gues you are waiting then. or you could maybe resize the mac partition to make space
2008-10-20T14:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kuthux	im unsure of mac resizing partitions using gparted as ive never done it
2008-10-20T14:52:00.000Z	kuthux	ActionParsnip	this is about Yaskin's question. tell him, not me
