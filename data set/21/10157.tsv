2005-05-11T14:03:00.000Z	Andril		air, bus I am learning so one day the Op's will ask me to join
2005-05-11T14:05:00.000Z	icebalm	Andril	how exactly does the user lose?
2005-05-11T14:06:00.000Z	icebalm	Andril	I'm using ubuntu now and you're wrong, OS X is much better
2005-05-11T14:07:00.000Z	Andril	icebalm	just speaking from my experience - comparing the Betas of both OS's
2005-05-11T14:07:00.000Z	icebalm	Andril	betas? both have atleast a couple releases out
2005-05-11T14:10:00.000Z	Andril	icebalm	I started Ubuntu in the Warty betas and Mac & Win has always had me on the beta list back since '93
2005-05-11T14:11:00.000Z	icebalm	Andril	that's nice, how about looking at them from their latest releases?
2005-05-11T14:12:00.000Z	icebalm	Andril	unfortunately linux, as a whole, any distribution, cannot even come close to OS X in terms of usability and software availability. That being said, ubuntu I believe is the best linux distribution.
2005-05-11T14:14:00.000Z	Andril	icebalm	true as it may be Linux and Ubuntu has scored a K.O. this year and with te Badger coming in months - they'll shake it up again
2005-05-11T14:16:00.000Z	icebalm	Andril	Unfortunately I think you have the reality distortion field set on reverse polarity
2005-05-11T14:17:00.000Z	Andril	icebalm	all's good in the shell - I get paid well to make Mac & Win to work for users daily - but when I come home Ubuntu does my work
2005-05-11T14:19:00.000Z	icebalm	Andril	and that's great, but claiming ubuntu is some how better than OS X is unfortunately folly at this point in the game
2005-05-11T14:21:00.000Z	Andril	icebalm	Win & Mac make me a living - true
2005-05-11T14:22:00.000Z	Andril	icebalm	True Indeed
2005-05-11T14:22:00.000Z	Andril	icebalm	what brings you to Ubuntu?
2005-05-11T14:23:00.000Z	icebalm	Andril	I run ubuntu on this pc
2005-05-11T14:23:00.000Z	Andril	icebalm	cool just asking
2005-05-11T14:23:00.000Z	Andril	icebalm	it has it's kinks but it requires some time to iron them out
2005-05-11T14:24:00.000Z	icebalm	Andril	ubuntu, at this point, seems like the best all-around linux distribution
2005-05-11T14:24:00.000Z	Andril	icebalm	I have always been a Underdog Fan Boy
2005-05-11T14:24:00.000Z	Andril	icebalm	ahhh we agree on that
