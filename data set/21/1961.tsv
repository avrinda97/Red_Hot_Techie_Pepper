2010-10-05T13:37:00.000Z	ddilinger		anyone use aria2c?  I'm using it to d/l the ubuntu iso and its slowly been climing from 300k/s up to now 830k/s.  Started with just 10 seeds and slowly grew to 70 now(i put max peers at 100 on command line).  Its taken almost 10 minutes to get from 300 to 800, how can i get that to get to the better speeds faster in the future?
2010-10-05T13:37:00.000Z	ddilinger		with bit torrent in aria2c, btw
2010-10-05T13:37:00.000Z	magnetron	ddilinger	where did you find the torrent?
2010-10-05T13:37:00.000Z	ddilinger	magnetron	ubuntu.com
2010-10-05T13:37:00.000Z	ddilinger	magnetron	http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/alternative-download#bt
2010-10-05T13:38:00.000Z	magnetron	ddilinger	i see. what is your internet connection speed?
2010-10-05T13:38:00.000Z	ddilinger	magnetron	20Mbit
2010-10-05T13:38:00.000Z	ddilinger	magnetron	so it should go up to >2MB, sabnzbd will do 1-2MB/s depending on how happy comcast is
2010-10-05T13:39:00.000Z	magnetron	ddilinger	wait, comcast? you know they throttle bittorrent?
2010-10-05T13:39:00.000Z	ddilinger	magnetron	but the max speed isn't what i'm so worried about, it annoys me that it climbs so slowly, like its slowly choosing connections
2010-10-05T13:39:00.000Z	ddilinger	magnetron	hence why i use sabnzbd
2010-10-05T13:40:00.000Z	ddilinger	magnetron	took 10 minutes to go from 10 peers to 80
2010-10-05T13:40:00.000Z	ddilinger	magnetron	should take 1 minute
2010-10-05T13:40:00.000Z	magnetron	ddilinger	since your ISP throttles bittorrent i suggest you download using the HTTP link instead
2010-10-05T13:40:00.000Z	ddilinger	magnetron	when already getting 850k/s ?
2010-10-05T13:40:00.000Z	magnetron	ddilinger	yes
2010-10-05T13:40:00.000Z	magnetron	ddilinger	your ISP is deliberately doing this to you
2010-10-05T13:40:00.000Z	ddilinger	magnetron	awfully silly, comcast with non-parallel http is 100k/s
2010-10-05T13:41:00.000Z	ddilinger	magnetron	you have to split the connection to get 2MB/s on http
2010-10-05T13:41:00.000Z	ddilinger		err, split the download across multiple http connections
2010-10-05T13:41:00.000Z	magnetron	ddilinger	try rtorrent and see if you get any different result
