2010-07-05T02:26:00.000Z	xanderal		Hey guys -- got a question about the ubuntu server 10.04 install
2010-07-05T02:27:00.000Z	xanderal		My server install keeps hanging at the "wiping swap space for security" screen at 21% completion. Any ideas why?
2010-07-05T02:28:00.000Z	xanderal		My server install keeps hanging at the "wiping swap space for security" screen at 21% completion, Any ideas why?
2010-07-05T02:29:00.000Z	xanderal		No disk activity, I have been waiting for over 25 minutes.
2010-07-05T02:30:00.000Z	xanderal		I'm not completely sure about that, my hard-disk is setup via a RAID controller, but I'm fairly certain the RAID controller is stable.
2010-07-05T02:31:00.000Z	xanderal		Is there a live disc for the server edition?
2010-07-05T02:33:00.000Z	xanderal		zcat: I tried this, alt+f4 shows me the output of the install, at the "wiping swap space for security" screen, there is no activity at all.
2010-07-05T02:34:00.000Z	linux_	xanderal	if its the cd scratched, you can try the ubuntu netboot cd and download ubuntu server
2010-07-05T02:35:00.000Z	linux_	xanderal	the only workaround would be to use a live linux (such as a regular ubuntu live cd) and install sswap to remove the swap for security, if you need this to be done
2010-07-05T02:37:00.000Z	linux_	xanderal	sswap takes many hours
2010-07-05T02:38:00.000Z	linux_	xanderal	it is wiping your swap 36 times with random data
2010-07-05T02:38:00.000Z	xanderal	linux_	Is there anyway to stop it?
2010-07-05T02:38:00.000Z	linux_	xanderal	not sure, you could try to kill the program running it, not sure what server edition uses, sswap or another app
2010-07-05T02:39:00.000Z	xanderal	linux_	How can I figure out exactly what's going on? alt+f4 doesn't show me anything.
2010-07-05T02:40:00.000Z	xanderal	linux_	How would I narrow down the pid of sswap?
2010-07-05T02:40:00.000Z	linux_	xanderal	can you get to a new screen with alt+ctrl+F2 (then alt+ctrl+F1 to return)
2010-07-05T02:42:00.000Z	xanderal	linux_	Don't know if it had anything to do with it, but I tried "kill sswap" and got the response "bad pid", then hit alt+ctrl+f2 (nothing happened), went back to the install screen and it told me the install was finished.
2010-07-05T02:43:00.000Z	linux_	xanderal	does that mean your problem is solved?
2010-07-05T02:43:00.000Z	xanderal	linux_	Trying to see if this is the case right now.
2010-07-05T02:44:00.000Z	xanderal	linux_	Think it's good to go. Guess I just needed to wait a tad bit longer.
2010-07-05T02:44:00.000Z	xanderal	linux_	Thanks for the help, you too, carl-m: and zcat:.
