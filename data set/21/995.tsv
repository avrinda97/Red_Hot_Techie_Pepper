2012-03-16T05:53:00.000Z	saintbasil		Question: I'm installing lucid lynx alternate cd on an old computer w/ a new HDD. It doesn't recognize my HDD and offers some drivers to use. However none of the drivers seem to follow a make/model pattern...so how do I know which driver to pick for my seagate barracuda hdd?
2012-03-16T05:54:00.000Z	dj_segfault	saintbasil	The hard drive is not recognized?  What kind of hard drive is it?  That's unusual
2012-03-16T05:55:00.000Z	saintbasil	dj_segfault	it's a brand new seagate barracuda 500 gb 7200. It is not recognized because the firmware can't recognize HDDs that big (my guess), so I'd like to make a small aprtition. But I need to pick a driver first to do that
2012-03-16T05:56:00.000Z	dj_segfault	saintbasil	If the BIOS can't deal with a hard drive that big then no drivers are going to help you.
2012-03-16T05:57:00.000Z	dj_segfault	saintbasil	One possibility is that it's not the absolute size, but number of cylinders.  Since it's all logical these days maybe you can calculate a different geometry with fewer cylinders that comes out to the same size.
2012-03-16T05:57:00.000Z	saintbasil	dj_segfault	well I'd like to try, I just need to know how to interpret  the esoteric driver names in terms of easily understood HDD names like western digital or seagate
2012-03-16T06:01:00.000Z	dj_segfault	saintbasil	What, what make and model is the hard drive?
2012-03-16T06:01:00.000Z	saintbasil	dj_segfault	seagate, barracuda, ST3500641AS-RK. 7200 rpm
2012-03-16T06:02:00.000Z	dj_segfault	saintbasil	I ask because I've read that certain external Seagate drives don't implement the real SCSI/ATAPI/etc interface, and actually do need drivers, so they don't work under Linux.
2012-03-16T06:03:00.000Z	saintbasil	dj_segfault	that would suck. i cringe at the thought of having to pay special attention to what hardware I can buy. It's happened before with printers...
2012-03-16T06:03:00.000Z	dj_segfault	saintbasil	This is internal, right?
2012-03-16T06:04:00.000Z	dj_segfault	saintbasil	 Do you have another computer you can hook it up to as a test?
2012-03-16T06:04:00.000Z	saintbasil	dj_segfault	no. I have a laptop but no enclosure
2012-03-16T06:05:00.000Z	saintbasil	dj_segfault	and I got it at a best buy, so if I take it in and say "it doesnt work with linux" everyone's heads are gonna explode
2012-03-16T06:08:00.000Z	dj_segfault	saintbasil	Google says that drive has no jumpers.  As I would expect from a SATA drive.  There is no master/slave
2012-03-16T06:08:00.000Z	saintbasil	dj_segfault	then i've been looking at HDDs for too long :(
2012-03-16T06:10:00.000Z	dj_segfault	saintbasil	Actually, is it possible the new drive is 6GB/s and your motherboard can't support that
2012-03-16T06:11:00.000Z	saintbasil	dj_segfault	im looking at the manual now and indeed there is a jumper to limit it to 1.5 gb/s, just dont know if it's set by default. continuing to read before i take it apart again
2012-03-16T06:14:00.000Z	saintbasil	dj_segfault	psusi, KI7MT: thank you for the help, I think I've discovered my problem and I'll try the fix now
2012-03-16T06:17:00.000Z	dj_segfault	saintbasil	So what was the problem?
2012-03-16T06:18:00.000Z	saintbasil	dj_segfault	I thought it needed to be speed limited, but dlentz said it can take sata 2 just fine
