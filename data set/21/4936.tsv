2009-11-10T01:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	IP-v6	add it to your startup items
2009-11-10T01:31:00.000Z	IP-v6	ActionParsnip	it is already added
2009-11-10T01:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	IP-v6	strange
2009-11-11T17:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	IP-v6	works fine here
2009-11-11T17:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	IP-v6	symlink or copy the flashplugin into /usr/lib/chromium-browser/plugins/
2009-11-11T17:34:00.000Z	IP-v6	ActionParsnip	i use x86_64 karmic but it doesnt work properly
2009-11-11T17:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	IP-v6	i use 64bit too, i use the alpha 64bit plugin. I just copied the .so file in there and added--enable-plugins to the launcher
2009-11-11T17:39:00.000Z	IP-v6	ActionParsnip	it works fine with firefox
2009-11-11T17:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	IP-v6	if you run:  sudo find / -iname "*.so" | grep flash       you will find the file, you can then symlink that file into the chromium plugins folder
2009-11-11T17:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	IP-v6	yes, because the plugin is in the folder, its not in the chromium one so wont work
2009-11-11T17:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	IP-v6	it will be called libflashplugin.so I think.
2009-11-11T17:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	IP-v6	i'd add --purge too   get the old configs out :)
2009-11-11T17:53:00.000Z	IP-v6	ActionParsnip	how can i install flashplayer now ?  should i download it from adobe web page ?
2009-11-11T17:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	IP-v6	copy the .so file you extracted from the tar.gz to /usr/lib/chromium-browser/plugins
2009-11-11T18:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	IP-v6	np man, the package versions for flash and java are garbage imo
2009-11-11T18:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	IP-v6	you will have to manually update the plugin yourself so keep an eye on the page yu downloaded from for updates
2010-03-22T11:54:00.000Z	IP-v6	ActionParsnip	yesterday i ve updated chromium and fonts were realy ugly
2010-03-22T11:59:00.000Z	IP-v6	ActionParsnip	how can i log a bug for chromium daily ? from launchped ?
2010-03-22T11:59:00.000Z	IP-v6	ActionParsnip	ok
