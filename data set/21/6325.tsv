2007-10-08T16:33:00.000Z	Bo^Dick		when i type this, "cp ./foofile ."
2007-10-08T16:34:00.000Z	Bo^Dick		why does the 64 bit exist?
2007-10-08T16:34:00.000Z	Bo^Dick		ukay
2007-10-08T16:34:00.000Z	Bo^Dick		is it faster maybe?
2007-10-08T16:36:00.000Z	Bo^Dick		this is truly puzzling
2007-10-08T09:06:00.000Z	Bo^Dick		hi
2007-10-08T09:06:00.000Z	Bo^Dick		maybe the 64 bit ubuntu will be popular in the future when apps and stuff support it?
2007-10-08T09:08:00.000Z	Bo^Dick		so why doesn't standard stuff like macromedia flash work with it then?
2007-10-08T09:10:00.000Z	Bo^Dick		or a better question, how do i tell youtube that i want to use gnash insted?
2007-10-08T09:11:00.000Z	Bo^Dick		i've run the nspluginwrapper and it gave an errormess
2007-10-08T09:11:00.000Z	trogdor	Bo^Dick	install the x86 version then
2007-10-08T09:12:00.000Z	trogdor	Bo^Dick	do you use 64 bit assembly code for development purposes?...
2007-10-08T09:13:00.000Z	trogdor	Bo^Dick	x86 works on everything...
2007-10-08T09:13:00.000Z	trogdor	Bo^Dick	the purpose is extra little assembly codes that do nothing unless they are used
2007-10-08T09:14:00.000Z	trogdor	Bo^Dick	contrary to opinion there are benchmark tests of most desktop related functions processing even higher on x86 OS with 64 bit processors
2007-10-08T09:15:00.000Z	trogdor	Bo^Dick	no reason at all!, now hurry up and install the other one before you end up in a dependency hell for installing 32 bit software
2007-10-08T09:17:00.000Z	trogdor	Bo^Dick	well I'm happen enough with 4gb ram for time being
2007-10-08T09:18:00.000Z	trogdor	Bo^Dick	of course
2007-10-08T09:20:00.000Z	trogdor	Bo^Dick	its higher for some things though
2007-10-08T09:20:00.000Z	trogdor	Bo^Dick	64 bit version mostly for sever environment
2007-10-08T09:21:00.000Z	trogdor	Bo^Dick	bleh server environment I meant, wow I am off today
