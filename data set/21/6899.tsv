2007-01-20T06:02:00.000Z	nekr0z	phixnay	Do you have Universe repos enabled?
2007-01-20T06:02:00.000Z	phixnay	nekr0z	- universe and multiverse enabled. maybe I need 32 bit libraries or something
2007-01-20T06:06:00.000Z	nekr0z	phixnay	Not sure. Why don't you check the official Wine repos? They have a most recent version anyway...
2007-01-20T06:07:00.000Z	phixnay	nekr0z	- I thought that was what I was using. I got the source lines from winehq
2007-01-20T06:09:00.000Z	nekr0z	phixnay	Then I'm lost. Did I understand it right - you have a 64bit system?
2007-01-20T06:10:00.000Z	phixnay	nekr0z	graft, with the normal repositories, I see things like libwine but not wine. Yes, I have 64
2007-01-20T06:13:00.000Z	nekr0z	phixnay	http://www.winehq.org/site/download-deb should give you a hint about 64bit systems.
2007-01-20T06:14:00.000Z	phixnay	nekr0z	- that's what I'm using right now
2007-01-20T06:15:00.000Z	nekr0z	phixnay	They say on that page, that there's no such thing as 64bit packages for wine. You have to build it from source.
2007-01-20T06:18:00.000Z	nekr0z	phixnay	Sorry, I was not following from the very beginning...
2007-01-20T06:19:00.000Z	nekr0z	phixnay	And you have headers, right?
2007-01-20T06:21:00.000Z	nekr0z	phixnay	And the same kernel version?
2007-01-20T06:22:00.000Z	nekr0z	phixnay	Here can be the problem: generic headers are not for 64bit kernel, as far as I know.
2007-01-20T06:23:00.000Z	nekr0z	phixnay	hmmm...
2007-01-20T06:24:00.000Z	nekr0z	phixnay	Damn me if I see where the problem is.
2007-01-20T07:11:00.000Z	phixnay	nekr0z	when I make symbolic links with ln -s can I tell it to make a backup of what it overwrites?
2007-01-20T07:13:00.000Z	nekr0z	phixnay	But you can copy them with different names to backup. Something "cp ./symlink ./symlink.backup
2007-01-20T07:13:00.000Z	phixnay	nekr0z	- thanks
2007-01-20T07:30:00.000Z	phixnay	nekr0z	I'm following the instructions for wine, but when it says [[ Set the library directories and the compiler environment.  LDFLAGS="-L/lib32 -L/usr/lib32 -Wl,-rpath,/lib32 -Wl,-rpath,/usr/lib32" CC="gcc-3.4 -m32" ] ]  what do I have to do?
