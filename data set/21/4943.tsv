2012-11-07T11:36:00.000Z	cliff_		it says "command not found"
2012-11-07T11:37:00.000Z	cliff_		that's the problem.  It acts like it installs, but I can't run it anywhere
2012-11-07T11:37:00.000Z	cliff_		trust me, I've tried a bunch of stuff
2012-11-07T11:37:00.000Z	cliff_		what do you mean?
2012-11-07T11:38:00.000Z	cliff_		i didn't figure I had to do that
2012-11-07T11:38:00.000Z	cliff_		Where would the install folder be?
2012-11-07T11:38:00.000Z	cliff_		it was a src.tar.xz file
2012-11-07T11:38:00.000Z	cliff_		I can't find the binary :/
2012-11-07T11:40:00.000Z	cliff_		i downloaded it, and ran pacman -U <projectm>.pkg.tar.xz
2012-11-07T11:40:00.000Z	cliff_		lspci | grep gpu
2012-11-07T11:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cliff_	this is Ubuntu support. Not Arch supoprt
2012-11-07T11:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cliff_	try running it in a terminal
2012-11-07T11:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cliff_	is the output useful?
2012-11-07T11:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cliff_	have you tried changing directory to the command and running it there
2012-11-07T11:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cliff_	did you add the install folder to $PATH
2012-11-07T11:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cliff_	well its obvious by the 'command not found' that you do
2012-11-07T11:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cliff_	where is the binary stored, and what is it called?
2012-11-07T11:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cliff_	so what are you running to make the app run?
2012-11-07T11:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cliff_	that's an arch command
2012-11-07T11:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cliff_	arch isn't supported here
2012-11-07T11:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cliff_	then ask in #arch not here
