2009-05-16T07:58:00.000Z	lstarnes	Classic	incorrect
2009-05-16T07:58:00.000Z	lstarnes	Classic	it uses the password of the invoking user
2009-05-16T07:58:00.000Z	lstarnes	Classic	it just requires that that user has access in /etc/sudoers or a group in that file
2009-05-16T07:59:00.000Z	lstarnes	Classic	yes
2009-05-17T01:00:00.000Z	lstarnes	Classic	/set gui_tray on
2009-05-17T01:00:00.000Z	Classic	lstarnes	I have it on, just when i close xchat it exits
2009-05-17T01:00:00.000Z	Classic	lstarnes	xchat closes that is
2009-05-17T01:00:00.000Z	lstarnes	Classic	you might need to manually minimize it
2009-05-17T01:01:00.000Z	Classic	lstarnes	yes, what i ment like pidgin, it can run in the background with no window open
2009-05-17T01:01:00.000Z	lstarnes	Classic	so can xchat, iirc
2009-05-17T01:01:00.000Z	Classic	lstarnes	just i dont see the preset anywhere
2009-05-17T01:05:00.000Z	lstarnes	Classic	click or double-click the xchat tray icon
2009-05-17T01:05:00.000Z	Classic	lstarnes	oh shoot, so simple, thanks
2009-05-17T01:05:00.000Z	lstarnes	Classic	I forgot about it too
2009-05-17T01:05:00.000Z	Classic	lstarnes	hehe, thanks, just i find many windows annoying if you know what i mean
