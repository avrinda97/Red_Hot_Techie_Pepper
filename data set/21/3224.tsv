2009-02-26T23:26:00.000Z	XPS_M1330		How do I change file associations?
2009-02-26T23:27:00.000Z	XPS_M1330		"still" using nautilus? Do you suggest a better filebrowser?
2009-02-26T23:28:00.000Z	XPS_M1330		try dolphin ;)
2009-02-26T23:28:00.000Z	XPS_M1330		yes I saw, thanks!
2009-02-26T23:29:00.000Z	XPS_M1330		kinda weird that I configured Opera as the default web browser and it still opens htm files with firefucks
2009-02-26T23:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	XPS_M1330	calling Firefox names hummmmmmm,  well  at least Firefox is much better than IE, and is also opensource, unlike Opera!
2009-02-26T23:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	XPS_M1330	oh Opera software make a resonablly nice product, but it would be much better I expect, if it was Open Source!
2009-02-26T23:30:00.000Z	XPS_M1330	sebsebseb	I agree!
2009-02-26T23:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	XPS_M1330	You didn't say it, but they say it: Opera the fastest brower. Ha!   try Konqueror
2009-02-26T23:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	XPS_M1330	not quite sure about that, but Konqueror runs faster than Firefox  for me.
2009-02-26T23:34:00.000Z	XPS_M1330	sebsebseb	good for you. but to me konqueror lacks basic features, which makes it a lesser browser
2009-02-26T23:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	XPS_M1330	maybe we make an exception for Opera, altough I hardly use that browser,  but  at  the end of the day it is evil, well according to Richard Stallman.  restricts our freedoms and locks people into a vender.   Just like Desktop Linux users make an exception for Mac OS X, because it is Unix based,  but people that use that still get locked into Apple.  Anyway we are off topic!
2009-02-26T23:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	XPS_M1330	yes  read articles on gnu.org in about free software section and that
2009-02-26T23:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	XPS_M1330	that is in the philosophey section
2009-02-26T23:37:00.000Z	XPS_M1330	sebsebseb	ok. well even though it's an evil corporate software, it's been offering me the best browsing experience for 10 years, and no other browser comes close (except firefox after adding a bunch of addons) to its convenience
2009-02-26T23:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	XPS_M1330	ok
2009-02-26T23:54:00.000Z	XPS_M1330	sebsebseb	yes, and lockheed martin!
