2009-05-09T07:49:00.000Z	vertagano	Armageddon	Where does it get stuck?
2009-05-09T07:50:00.000Z	Armageddon	vertagano	let me tell you what happened, i was installing a widget which needed a fix in compiz, i was writting the option in compiz and the desktop env. crashed so i forced a restart and it was still off. so i went into recovery mode and tried to autofix the graphic card, so now its stuck on the loading page, with distorted graohics
2009-05-09T07:52:00.000Z	vertagano	Armageddon	If you switch to the tty1 (Ctrl+Alt+F1), do you see any useful messages?
2009-05-09T07:52:00.000Z	Armageddon	vertagano	i didnt try, should i restart ?
2009-05-09T07:52:00.000Z	vertagano	Armageddon	I would just try switching while it's stuck on the distorted graphics.

2009-05-09T08:06:00.000Z	vertagano	Armageddon	In order to advise how to repair it, it would require figuring out what needs repaired.
