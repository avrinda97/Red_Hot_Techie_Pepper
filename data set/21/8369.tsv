2008-07-11T07:04:00.000Z	sheep	jdsbluedevl	can you see them in any applications?
2008-07-11T07:05:00.000Z	sheep	jdsbluedevl	for the terminal, the reason why the scrollbar was blank was due to there nothing to scroll up or down to in that screehshot
2008-07-11T07:05:00.000Z	sheep	jdsbluedevl	you may need to change your window decorations or GTK theme
2008-07-11T07:06:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	sheep	look at the screenshot again
2008-07-11T07:06:00.000Z	sheep	jdsbluedevl	i did.  5 times
2008-07-11T07:06:00.000Z	sheep	jdsbluedevl	oh
2008-07-11T07:06:00.000Z	sheep	jdsbluedevl	I detect a problem with your personal settings or compiz's configuration
2008-07-11T07:07:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	sheep	I'll turn off compiz first and see if it persists
2008-07-11T07:08:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	sheep	you're right, the problem is in Compiz
2008-07-11T07:09:00.000Z	sheep	jdsbluedevl	check system > preferences > advanced desktop effects settings
2008-07-11T07:10:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	sheep	what next?
2008-07-11T07:10:00.000Z	sheep	jdsbluedevl	I'm not sure exactly which setting would need to be changed
