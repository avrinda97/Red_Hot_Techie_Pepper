2008-03-11T06:16:00.000Z	Flannel	A86	#winehq will be able to help you set wine up
2008-03-11T06:17:00.000Z	Flannel	A86	In wine install? or in farcry install?
2008-03-11T06:17:00.000Z	Flannel	A86	#winehq is going to be much more helpful than we could ever be.
2008-03-11T06:19:00.000Z	Flannel	A86	Go ask the #winehq people for help, they should be able to help.
2008-03-11T06:54:00.000Z	Flannel	A86	what?  end user only?  You are an end-uesr
2008-03-11T07:06:00.000Z	Flannel	A86	Wine 0.9.57 isn't in the Ubuntu repositories.  We don't support it.  #winehq is the place to go for wine support.  Especially if you're using a non-Ubuntu version.
2008-03-11T07:06:00.000Z	Flannel	A86	Upgrade wine?
2008-03-11T07:07:00.000Z	Flannel	A86	you upgraded Ubuntu? or upgraded wine?
2008-03-11T07:07:00.000Z	Flannel	A86	you upgraded Ubuntu? or upgraded wine?
2008-03-11T07:08:00.000Z	Flannel	A86	revert back to the official wine in Ubuntu.  that should fix it.
2008-03-11T07:12:00.000Z	Flannel	A86	I already suggested one.  You really need to start paying attention to the people trying to help you:  Remove the wine you have now, revert to the wine that in your Ubuntu version
