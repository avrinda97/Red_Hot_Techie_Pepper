2007-09-25T08:58:00.000Z	dystopianray	cyber_brain_mfkg	you need to forward the ports your torrent client is using to the machien it is running on
2007-09-25T08:58:00.000Z	cyber_brain_mfkg	dystopianray	how to do that?
2007-09-25T08:59:00.000Z	cyber_brain_mfkg	dystopianray	i am useing gnome bittorrent!
2007-09-25T09:00:00.000Z	dystopianray	cyber_brain_mfkg	it depends on how your network is setup
2007-09-25T09:00:00.000Z	dystopianray	cyber_brain_mfkg	how are you connected to the internet?
2007-09-25T09:00:00.000Z	dystopianray	cyber_brain_mfkg	and does your network use dhcp or static ips?
2007-09-25T09:01:00.000Z	cyber_brain_mfkg	dystopianray	i am useing WiFi over Access Point!have static ip 192.168.0.2(eth0) that connects on 192.168.0.1(AP)!
2007-09-25T09:02:00.000Z	dystopianray	cyber_brain_mfkg	does the AP connect directly to the internet or go through a modem?
2007-09-25T09:02:00.000Z	cyber_brain_mfkg	dystopianray	AP is connectet directly to my ISP!
2007-09-25T09:02:00.000Z	dystopianray	cyber_brain_mfkg	you need to configure your AP to forward the correct prots to your machines address
2007-09-25T09:03:00.000Z	cyber_brain_mfkg	dystopianray	my AP is not router and don't need to be forwared!
2007-09-25T09:03:00.000Z	dystopianray	cyber_brain_mfkg	what do you mean?
2007-09-25T09:05:00.000Z	cyber_brain_mfkg	dystopianray	i used to use "iptables -A FORWARD -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT" and it worked fine till few days ago!i had to type this command every time i restarted my machine and now it won't work! :(
2007-09-25T09:06:00.000Z	dystopianray	cyber_brain_mfkg	your AP has iptables?
2007-09-25T09:08:00.000Z	cyber_brain_mfkg	dystopianray	i am useing pppoe and i have no access to my ISP servers at all!
2007-09-25T09:08:00.000Z	dystopianray	cyber_brain_mfkg	i never said anything about your isps servers
2007-09-25T09:09:00.000Z	cyber_brain_mfkg	dystopianray	u think if i change to DHCP i won't have forwarding problems???
2007-09-25T09:09:00.000Z	dystopianray	cyber_brain_mfkg	i doubt it
2007-09-25T09:10:00.000Z	dystopianray	cyber_brain_mfkg	stick to your current setup
2007-09-25T09:10:00.000Z	dystopianray	cyber_brain_mfkg	all you need to do is forward the torrent ports from the AP to your client machine
