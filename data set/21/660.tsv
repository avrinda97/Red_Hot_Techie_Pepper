2011-10-06T21:39:00.000Z	w30	Balaji_TVR	in a terminal type: sudo find / -name C++Annotation-pdf -print     then cd to that directory in your file manager and click on it
2011-10-06T21:43:00.000Z	Balaji_TVR	w30	Thank you. I've installed many help/doc package for c++ or linux and etc. So to open those doc file, is there any better way to open in some unified interface? or only way is to search? The problem in search is I would not no the exact file name as I install those as packages.
2011-10-06T21:47:00.000Z	w30	Balaji_TVR	most linux distros have a doc or docs folder somewhere. mine is /usr/share/doc
2011-10-06T21:49:00.000Z	Balaji_TVR	w30	yep, for me too the same but I see several 100s of folders for everything.  Would like to know is there any better editor to open the wanted one in organized way. Something similar to MSDN editor.
2011-10-06T21:50:00.000Z	w30	Balaji_TVR	 also man  <command> or info <command> will acces documentation
2011-10-06T21:52:00.000Z	w30	Balaji_TVR	apropos <subject> is a good fishing command to lead  to something more
2011-10-06T21:54:00.000Z	Balaji_TVR	w30	Thank you. I have located the folder and the installed file name is "cplusplusus.pdf". So, after manual search in the whole doc folder, I have found the file name to open. Hence, at first place, without knowing the file name one could not search too.
2011-10-06T21:55:00.000Z	Balaji_TVR	w30	the installed package name is "c++annotation-pdf" and the file name what I see and required is "cplusplus.pdf". I could succeed only after manual search. I would like to know is there any better way to locate through nice help/doc interface.
2011-10-06T21:56:00.000Z	w30	Balaji_TVR	and don't forget system help in the menu
2011-10-06T21:58:00.000Z	w30	Balaji_TVR	too many  different help and doc schemes exist for Linux, that I agree too.
2011-10-06T22:00:00.000Z	w30	Balaji_TVR	after you install a program or app you can query Synaptic to see what installed. decs, executables, etc
2011-10-06T22:00:00.000Z	Balaji_TVR	w30	the cmd "dpkg -L c++annotations-pdf" says the package is not installed but Synaptic shows that its installed and I could manually see those files too.
2011-10-06T22:02:00.000Z	Balaji_TVR	w30	from there only "installed-files tab" I was able to locate the folder and files installed
2011-10-06T22:04:00.000Z	w30	Balaji_TVR	case is very important in Linux so always check caps key *smile*
2011-10-06T22:05:00.000Z	Balaji_TVR	w30	Thanks for correcting my topo. I could see the same what we could see via synaptic "installed-files" tab. Also I agree with you that every application can put the files under its own directory structure with its own format.
2011-10-06T22:05:00.000Z	w30	Balaji_TVR	glebihan did that
2011-10-06T22:06:00.000Z	Balaji_TVR	w30	what is glebihan?!
2011-10-06T22:07:00.000Z	Balaji_TVR	w30	oops, another user!
2011-10-06T22:09:00.000Z	w30	Balaji_TVR	able to read minds
2011-10-06T22:11:00.000Z	Balaji_TVR	w30	thanks for your response.
2011-10-06T22:12:00.000Z	w30	Balaji_TVR	stick with Linux a while, it's powerful when you find out how to use it
