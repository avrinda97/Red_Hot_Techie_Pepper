2007-06-13T12:02:00.000Z	sebrock		how do I start Ubuntu in runlevel 3???????
2007-06-13T12:03:00.000Z	sebrock		yes?
2007-06-13T12:04:00.000Z	sebrock		Azul, yes and then what?
2007-06-13T12:04:00.000Z	idefixx	sebrock	im not really sure never used that in ubuntu but i guess /etc/event.d/rc-default does that somehow.
2007-06-13T12:04:00.000Z	sebrock		I figure ubuntu only has 2 different runlevles by default
2007-06-13T12:05:00.000Z	idefixx	sebrock	when you look at the script it just checks for inittab (which doesnt exists) and defaults sto 2 (at the end) probably just change that to3 :)
2007-06-13T12:05:00.000Z	sebrock	idefixx	how what?
2007-06-13T12:06:00.000Z	idefixx	sebrock	did you find the script i was talking about?
2007-06-13T12:07:00.000Z	sebrock	idefixx	which one?
2007-06-13T12:08:00.000Z	idefixx	sebrock	the one i mentioned when i first hilighted you here in the chan... look above.
2007-06-13T12:08:00.000Z	sebrock		event.d?
2007-06-13T12:08:00.000Z	idefixx	sebrock	dude there is a path infront of that!
2007-06-13T12:08:00.000Z	sebrock		OK Im in that now
2007-06-13T12:09:00.000Z	sebrock	idefixx	now what?
2007-06-13T12:09:00.000Z	idefixx	sebrock	well look at line 20 it says 'telinit 2' which is the runlev it defaults to. im not sure about this... but i guess that is what makes ubuntu go to rc2.
2007-06-13T12:10:00.000Z	sebrock		hm
2007-06-13T12:10:00.000Z	idefixx	sebrock	in any case why do you want to change the runlevel?
2007-06-13T12:10:00.000Z	sebrock		running a fileserver gui not needed
2007-06-13T12:11:00.000Z	idefixx	sebrock	unless you are on ubutnu-server my rc3 start gdm, too...
2007-06-13T12:12:00.000Z	sebrock	idefixx	I use ubuntu server, thing is I installed ubuntu-desktop for some configuration pupose
2007-06-13T12:14:00.000Z	idefixx	sebrock	well im not the best person to help you with that.. since i never used ubuntu server, and from what i know on that issue (not much) server does this kind of stuff very different.
