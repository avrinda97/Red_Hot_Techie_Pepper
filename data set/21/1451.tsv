2010-09-07T17:23:00.000Z	rob_p	Rout	That's CUPS, not SSH

2010-09-07T17:24:00.000Z	rob_p	Rout	You need to start the service
2010-09-07T17:24:00.000Z	Rout		ok wait
2010-09-07T17:24:00.000Z	rob_p	Rout	sudo /etc/init.d/ssh start
2010-09-07T17:25:00.000Z	Rout	rob_p	:  * Starting OpenBSD Secure Shell server sshd
2010-09-07T17:25:00.000Z	rob_p	Rout	:-)

2010-09-07T17:26:00.000Z	Rout		its not there
2010-09-07T17:26:00.000Z	rob_p	Rout	It *should* be there.  If not, go look at logs for clues...
2010-09-07T17:27:00.000Z	Rout		something is wrong
2010-09-07T17:28:00.000Z	rob_p	Rout	Did you change anything in /etc/ssh/sshd_config file?
2010-09-07T17:29:00.000Z	rob_p	Rout	Also, make sure your /etc/default/ssh config isn't disallowing it to start.
