2006-09-27T10:07:00.000Z	OmniD		wow
2006-09-27T10:07:00.000Z	OmniD		why has no one told me about automatix before
2006-09-27T10:08:00.000Z	OmniD		I know what it is NOW
2006-09-27T10:09:00.000Z	OmniD		Is it dangerous?
2006-09-27T10:10:00.000Z	OmniD		*then why
2006-09-27T10:10:00.000Z	Madpilot	OmniD	automatix is still popular for some reason - why exactly still puzzles many people...
2006-09-27T10:12:00.000Z	OmniD	Madpilot	isn't it still easy to use? That's why people would use it.
2006-09-27T10:12:00.000Z	Madpilot	OmniD	yes, it's easy to break your system with it ;)
2006-09-27T10:12:00.000Z	OmniD	Madpilot	I was recommended to use it because unrar is failing install
2006-09-27T10:13:00.000Z	Madpilot	OmniD	unrar is in Universe, I think - if you've got Universe enabled properly, unrar should install just fine
2006-09-27T10:13:00.000Z	OmniD	Madpilot	it is not there
2006-09-27T10:13:00.000Z	Madpilot		!info unrar
2006-09-27T10:13:00.000Z	OmniD		Package unrar is not available, but is referred to by another package.
2006-09-27T10:13:00.000Z	Madpilot	OmniD	sorry, it's in Multiverse - do you have that enabled?
2006-09-27T10:13:00.000Z	OmniD		This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
2006-09-27T10:13:00.000Z	OmniD		is only available from another source
2006-09-27T10:13:00.000Z	OmniD		E: Package unrar has no installation candidate
2006-09-27T10:13:00.000Z	OmniD		Yes
2006-09-27T10:13:00.000Z	OmniD		I have both enabled
2006-09-27T10:14:00.000Z	OmniD		Is there any way I could look up to be sure though?
2006-09-27T10:15:00.000Z	Madpilot	OmniD	easiest way - at least, easiest to explain here - is to open a terminal and type "gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list" then pastebin that
