2006-01-07T15:04:00.000Z	Toba		is there a way to get ubuntu to shut up about it when filesystems (usb) automout?
2006-01-07T15:05:00.000Z	Toba		asking to import photos and popping up this file manager window is getting old
2006-01-07T15:05:00.000Z	Toba		oh
2006-01-07T15:05:00.000Z	Toba		sure
2006-01-07T15:05:00.000Z	Toba		one sec battalion
2006-01-07T15:05:00.000Z	Toba		thx ompaul
2006-01-07T15:06:00.000Z	Toba		hrm
2006-01-07T15:06:00.000Z	Toba		how would you convert an rpm to deb?
2006-01-07T15:06:00.000Z	Toba		there was a program that did that I thought
2006-01-07T15:06:00.000Z	mwe	Toba	alien
2006-01-07T15:06:00.000Z	mwe	Toba	be careful though
2006-01-07T15:06:00.000Z	mwe	Toba	the pacages can cause breakage
2006-01-07T15:07:00.000Z	Toba		I guess they could
2006-01-07T15:07:00.000Z	Toba		since they would be from a different repo
2006-01-07T15:07:00.000Z	Toba		and want different and strange dependencies
2006-01-07T15:07:00.000Z	mwe	Toba	and for a different distribution
2006-01-07T15:07:00.000Z	Toba	mwe	oh, and that too :)
2006-01-07T15:07:00.000Z	mwe	Toba	however if it breaks just uninstall it
2006-01-07T15:07:00.000Z	Toba		meh
2006-01-07T15:08:00.000Z	mwe	Toba	just make sure you don't --force install it
