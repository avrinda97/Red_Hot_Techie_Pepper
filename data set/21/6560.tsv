2010-08-19T23:19:00.000Z	jorn		hey guys, is it possible that scripts in /etc/cron.daily were not executed on a server (so always running) in Ubuntu 8.04 ?
2010-08-19T23:20:00.000Z	jorn		in /etc/crontab I find lines which test for anacron's existence, if it's there they do nothing... and anacron is started on boot, but exits after running all jobs that were left out
2010-08-19T23:21:00.000Z	jorn		so how is anacron going to run those jobs?
2010-08-19T23:21:00.000Z	jorn		and in crontab the lines look like this: test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily )
2010-08-19T23:22:00.000Z	jorn		(cron is running)
2010-08-19T23:22:00.000Z	jorn		but as anacron is installed it tests for its existence and quits without invoking it
2010-08-19T23:23:00.000Z	jorn		;)
2010-08-19T23:23:00.000Z	jorn		are jobs in /etc/cron.daily executed on a daily basis even when the server is not rebooted?
2010-08-19T23:24:00.000Z	jorn		if yes: by hom?
2010-08-19T23:24:00.000Z	jorn		s/hom/whom/
2010-08-19T23:26:00.000Z	rob_p	jorn	all the scripts in the directory will be run *if* /usr/sbin/anacron is executable.  They will be run by root as per the crontab entry.
2010-08-19T23:27:00.000Z	jorn	rob_p	no, that would be &&
2010-08-19T23:28:00.000Z	rob_p	jorn	the || acts as a stop if the first argument exits with a status of 1 otherwise the second will proceed
2010-08-19T23:28:00.000Z	jorn	rob_p	in what language?
2010-08-19T23:28:00.000Z	rob_p	jorn	shell script (sh, bash, etc.)
2010-08-19T23:28:00.000Z	jorn	rob_p	just go to your shell and write this: "true || echo 'something'"
2010-08-19T23:54:00.000Z	rob_p	jorn	You still around?
2010-08-19T23:59:00.000Z	jorn	rob_p	yupp
2010-08-20T00:01:00.000Z	rob_p	jorn	Yeah, I inadvertently misled you earlier.  If the anacron is executable then *don't* execute run-parts.  Sorry about that.  I always forget that an exit status of 0 is success, not 1!  :-)
2010-08-20T00:01:00.000Z	jorn	rob_p	actually I see that the problem is solved in 10.04 by including an anacron cronjob: /etc/cron.d/anacron the line which is commented out is the one I use now ;)
2010-08-20T00:02:00.000Z	jorn	rob_p	but would be nice to see this backported to 8.04 (it's actually only adding this file in the anacron package). I regard this a serious security problem as it hindered my server updating its antivir-db for months now
