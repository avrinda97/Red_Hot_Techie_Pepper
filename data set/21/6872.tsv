2008-01-06T20:35:00.000Z	hairulfr	pawan	Mp3, but please type man streamripper before asking further questions, i already think i've gone above and beyond
2008-01-06T20:55:00.000Z	hairulfr	pawan	Maybe you exceeded the 50 mbs?
2008-01-06T20:55:00.000Z	hairulfr	pawan	Man streamripper
2008-01-06T20:56:00.000Z	hairulfr	pawan	I never had that problem, maybe your comp is broken or not "good" enough
2008-01-06T20:58:00.000Z	hairulfr	pawan	I rip that channel fine, no buffer problems
2008-01-06T20:59:00.000Z	hairulfr	pawan	Try not setting a limit
2008-01-06T20:59:00.000Z	hairulfr	pawan	Well, if you do not set a limit you shoudln't set the argument for limit either so remove the -M
2008-01-06T21:03:00.000Z	hairulfr	pawan	Google or read the documentation, I don't know what the problem is, but it's in your end I think.
