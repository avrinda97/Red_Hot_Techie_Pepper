2007-04-10T07:43:00.000Z	EruditeHermit		hey, I am unable to get mplayerplugin working with my edgy install, can anyone help? It keeps trying to buffer but it never plays video
2007-04-10T07:43:00.000Z	Pelo	EruditeHermit	 you mean in firefox ?
2007-04-10T07:43:00.000Z	EruditeHermit	Pelo	yes
2007-04-10T07:43:00.000Z	Pelo	EruditeHermit	 use synaptic to remove  totem-mozilla
2007-04-10T07:44:00.000Z	EruditeHermit	Pelo	already did that
2007-04-10T07:44:00.000Z	Pelo	EruditeHermit	 realy ?  and make sure that mplayer-mozilla is installed ?
2007-04-10T07:44:00.000Z	EruditeHermit	Pelo	yep its installed
2007-04-10T07:44:00.000Z	Pelo	EruditeHermit	 codecs ?
2007-04-10T07:44:00.000Z	EruditeHermit	Pelo	it keeps trying to buffer the video and it fails to start playing, yes w32codecs is installed
2007-04-10T07:45:00.000Z	Pelo	EruditeHermit	 remove mplater mozilla  completely from synaptic using the completely remove option, that will get rid of the local settings files and then install again
2007-04-10T07:47:00.000Z	EruditeHermit	Pelo	same problem it keeps cycling between connected and connecting to
2007-04-10T07:47:00.000Z	Pelo	EruditeHermit	 try a different site maybe ?
2007-04-10T07:48:00.000Z	EruditeHermit	Pelo	all sites
2007-04-10T07:48:00.000Z	EruditeHermit	Pelo	tried BBC CNN Yahoo
2007-04-10T07:48:00.000Z	EruditeHermit	Pelo	all work on my debian install
2007-04-10T07:48:00.000Z	Pelo	EruditeHermit	  right click on the applet in the browser,  go to properties , and try adjusting the buffer
2007-04-10T07:49:00.000Z	Pelo	EruditeHermit	 you can also try asking the nice ppl in #mplayer , they might have an idea
2007-04-10T07:50:00.000Z	EruditeHermit	Pelo	when I changed that, it just cycles between the connecting and connected more rapidly
2007-04-10T07:50:00.000Z	Pelo	EruditeHermit	 well at least it is having some effect
2007-04-10T07:51:00.000Z	Pelo	EruditeHermit	 try asking in #mplayer,  I'm out of ideas
2007-04-10T07:51:00.000Z	EruditeHermit	Pelo	ok thanks
