2007-04-04T05:12:00.000Z	tunganet	awesomess3	warcraft III, not WOW
2007-04-04T05:15:00.000Z	awesomess3	tunganet	Do the WCIII ever run slow on wine?
2007-04-04T05:15:00.000Z	tunganet	awesomess3	no, never.
2007-04-04T05:15:00.000Z	awesomess3	tunganet	and are you running the latest wine?
2007-04-04T05:15:00.000Z	tunganet	awesomess3	yes latest
2007-04-04T05:16:00.000Z	awesomess3	tunganet	that is awesome :).  Have you ever had any issues?
2007-04-04T05:16:00.000Z	tunganet	awesomess3	i couldn't use the numpad more than once before, but it is fixed after a update.
2007-04-04T05:17:00.000Z	awesomess3	tunganet	if I may ask, what does `wine --version` say?  Mine is wine-0.9.31
2007-04-04T05:17:00.000Z	tunganet	awesomess3	give wine a try with warcraft, it was smiple for me
2007-04-04T05:17:00.000Z	tunganet	awesomess3	33 i believe
2007-04-04T05:17:00.000Z	tunganet	awesomess3	let me double check
2007-04-04T05:17:00.000Z	tunganet	awesomess3	my bad . 9.0.34
2007-04-04T05:18:00.000Z	awesomess3	tunganet	ty for checking :)
2007-04-04T05:18:00.000Z	tunganet	awesomess3	i can also run counter strike 1.6 with wine :)
2007-04-04T05:19:00.000Z	awesomess3	tunganet	I run ut2004 w/o wine, and I don't know if I can stand 2 FPS games :)
2007-04-04T05:19:00.000Z	tunganet	awesomess3	you run it w/o (without) wine?
2007-04-04T05:20:00.000Z	awesomess3	tunganet	yeah it has Linux binaries on the CDs :)))
2007-04-04T05:21:00.000Z	awesomess3	tunganet	I wish it ran faster though, I have a GeForce 3 Ti200 512MB, but it depends largely on the the maps, some maps are incredibly slow (< 25 FPS)
2007-04-04T05:21:00.000Z	tunganet	awesomess3	i get 100fps with geforce 5200 128mb on cs1.6
2007-04-04T05:22:00.000Z	awesomess3	tunganet	that is awesome :))
