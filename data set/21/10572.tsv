2005-01-31T15:42:00.000Z	jfly		hello
2005-01-31T15:42:00.000Z	jfly		need help :-)
2005-01-31T15:42:00.000Z	jfly		try to have sound but haven't succeed yet
2005-01-31T15:43:00.000Z	nuOpus	jfly	What kind of sound?
2005-01-31T15:43:00.000Z	jfly		to make my soundcard working
2005-01-31T15:43:00.000Z	nuOpus	jfly	I mean ... what kind of sound card?
2005-01-31T15:43:00.000Z	jfly		first, i didn't find alsaconf so i downloaded alsa-utils from the alsa-project site
2005-01-31T15:44:00.000Z	nuOpus	jfly	Well what kind of sound card
2005-01-31T15:44:00.000Z	jfly		i810-intel
2005-01-31T15:44:00.000Z	nuOpus	jfly	I know what your issue is
2005-01-31T15:44:00.000Z	jfly		really?
2005-01-31T15:44:00.000Z	jfly		great
2005-01-31T15:44:00.000Z	nuOpus	jfly	Well .... does it load but the volume doesnt work? I mean ... the MASTER volume doesnt control it
2005-01-31T15:45:00.000Z	jfly		when I finish with the alsaconf, it tells me that no soundcards were found
2005-01-31T15:45:00.000Z	nuOpus	jfly	I have one of those ... the card WAS working .. but the MASTER volume was not working ... to get it to work I had to adjust with the headphones volume
2005-01-31T15:45:00.000Z	nuOpus	jfly	Passed the ac_97 quirk and it fixed it
2005-01-31T15:46:00.000Z	jfly	nuOpus	but iz's not the problem because he does tell me that there is no soundcard
2005-01-31T15:46:00.000Z	nuOpus	jfly	oh
2005-01-31T15:46:00.000Z	nuOpus	jfly	Sorry I can't help you jfly
2005-01-31T15:46:00.000Z	jfly		nuOpus:how did you configure yours?
2005-01-31T15:46:00.000Z	nuOpus	jfly	it did it automatically ... just had the volume trouble making me think it didnt work
