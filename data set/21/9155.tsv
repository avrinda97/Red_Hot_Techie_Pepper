2006-02-25T06:21:00.000Z	jjjjjjj		can i say the f word here?  cuz i got  libstdc++5 and ++b but nomachine comes back with  nxclient depends on libstdc++2.10-glibc2.2; however:
2006-02-25T06:21:00.000Z	jjjjjjj		  Package libstdc++2.10-glibc2.2 is not installed.
2006-02-25T06:22:00.000Z	jjjjjjj		++6 i meant
2006-02-25T06:22:00.000Z	LjL	jjjjjjj	was that a debian package that you tried to install?
2006-02-25T06:22:00.000Z	jjjjjjj		nxclient_1.5.0-141_i386.deb
2006-02-25T06:23:00.000Z	LjL	jjjjjjj	i don't have that in my repos, so i suppose it could indeed be a debian package
2006-02-25T06:23:00.000Z	LjL	jjjjjjj	debian packages aren't necessarily compatible with ubuntu
2006-02-25T06:23:00.000Z	jjjjjjj		i was reading up on freenx and saw the nomachine link
2006-02-25T06:24:00.000Z	jjjjjjj	dyrne	 for freenx ?
2006-02-25T06:25:00.000Z	LjL	jjjjjjj	are you absolutely sure you have the package it complains about installed?
2006-02-25T06:25:00.000Z	jjjjjjj		pretty sure...
2006-02-25T06:26:00.000Z	jjjjjjj		ii  libstdc++5     3.3.6-8ubuntu1 The GNU Standard C++ Library v3
2006-02-25T06:26:00.000Z	jjjjjjj		ii  libstdc++6     4.0.1-4ubuntu9 The GNU Standard C++ Library v3
2006-02-25T06:26:00.000Z	LjL	jjjjjjj	but that's not the package it complained about, unless i misunderstood you
2006-02-25T06:26:00.000Z	LjL	jjjjjjj	wasn't it complaining about libstdc++2.10-glibc2.2 ?
2006-02-25T06:27:00.000Z	jjjjjjj		 Package libstdc++2.10-glibc2.2 is not installed.
2006-02-25T06:27:00.000Z	jjjjjjj		  You mean i have to install an earlier version?
2006-02-25T06:27:00.000Z	LjL	jjjjjjj	that's not an earlier version, it's just a different package
2006-02-25T06:28:00.000Z	jjjjjjj		ahhhhhh  thanks dude
2006-02-25T06:28:00.000Z	LjL	jjjjjjj	otherwise you wouldn't even have the *choice* of installing it from the current breezy repos
2006-02-25T06:28:00.000Z	LjL	jjjjjjj	just "sudo aptitude install libstdc++2.10-glibc2.2"
