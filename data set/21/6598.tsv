2007-04-24T14:32:00.000Z	dinochopins		hi ...
2007-04-24T14:32:00.000Z	dinochopins		is there anyone has any experience with fetchmail ?
2007-04-24T14:32:00.000Z	dinochopins		I try to get my "catch-all" email account
2007-04-24T14:33:00.000Z	dinochopins		and delivered that into my users's mailboxes
2007-04-24T14:34:00.000Z	velko	dinochopins	you need an example on what to put in .fetchmailrc or you have some specific problem?
2007-04-24T14:34:00.000Z	dinochopins	velko	: some specific problem
2007-04-24T14:35:00.000Z	dinochopins	velko	: so.. i have a "catch-all" account on my domain (let's say abc.com)... and have just one email account at my ISP
2007-04-24T14:35:00.000Z	dinochopins	velko	that is the catch-all account (catchall@abc.com)
2007-04-24T14:36:00.000Z	dinochopins	velko	then I can catch all the email addressses directed to abc.domain (dino@abc.com, maria@abc.com, etc)
2007-04-24T14:37:00.000Z	dinochopins	velko	then I need to pop all those emails and distributed it to my local Ubuntu's accounts based on that email account (dino@abc.com will be delivered to dino.. and so on)
2007-04-24T14:38:00.000Z	velko	dinochopins	this is done by procmail and not by fetchmail :-)
2007-04-24T14:41:00.000Z	dinochopins	velko	: Oh... ok, will take a look at them
2007-04-24T14:41:00.000Z	dinochopins	velko	Thank you very much
2007-04-24T14:41:00.000Z	velko	dinochopins	they are a lot of howtos and examples on the net. np
2007-04-24T14:42:00.000Z	dinochopins	velko	procmail is mailing list manager ?
2007-04-24T14:42:00.000Z	dinochopins	velko	that's not what i mean :P
2007-04-24T14:43:00.000Z	velko	dinochopins	huh? ok, maybe i missed the joke though...
2007-04-24T14:43:00.000Z	dinochopins	velko	sorry... I just read the manual and seems it can be the solution
2007-04-24T14:44:00.000Z	dinochopins	velko	thank you.. will learn it thoroughly first
2007-04-24T14:44:00.000Z	velko	dinochopins	it can be ;-)
2007-04-24T14:44:00.000Z	dinochopins	velko	really appreciate it
