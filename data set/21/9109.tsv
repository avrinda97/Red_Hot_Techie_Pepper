2006-04-21T08:09:00.000Z	fatehaze		Also, is there any way to open Pages files in Ubuntu?
2006-04-21T08:09:00.000Z	fatehaze		I could just open the files and save them as new files... if I could open them
2006-04-21T08:09:00.000Z	linuxgeekery	fatehaze	I don't think so (yet
2006-04-21T08:10:00.000Z	linuxgeekery	fatehaze	what are the permissions on the folders you can't read?
2006-04-21T08:12:00.000Z	fatehaze	linuxgeekery	I can open the folders with gksudo nautilus, but even when I set the permissions to 777 it won't let me copy
2006-04-21T08:13:00.000Z	linuxgeekery	fatehaze	hmm
2006-04-21T08:13:00.000Z	linuxgeekery	fatehaze	wait... these are on the OS X partition, right?
2006-04-21T08:14:00.000Z	fatehaze	linuxgeekery	yup
2006-04-21T08:14:00.000Z	fatehaze	linuxgeekery	OSX won't boot so I'm trying to recover my files with ubuntu
2006-04-21T08:15:00.000Z	linuxgeekery	fatehaze	try going from the command line
2006-04-21T08:15:00.000Z	linuxgeekery	fatehaze	"sudo -s" and "cd /path/to/osx"
2006-04-21T08:15:00.000Z	fatehaze	linuxgeekery	what's the command to copy files and directories?  I've been using "cp * /home/backup" but it only copies files
2006-04-21T08:15:00.000Z	linuxgeekery	fatehaze	cp -a
2006-04-21T08:16:00.000Z	fatehaze	linuxgeekery	thanks :)
2006-04-21T08:16:00.000Z	linuxgeekery	fatehaze	if you want to make totally sure to preserve everything, do cp -aL
2006-04-21T08:17:00.000Z	linuxgeekery	fatehaze	-a means copy everything, -L means follow all symlinks
2006-04-21T08:18:00.000Z	linuxgeekery	fatehaze	you could also do "dd if=/dev/osxpartition_name of=~/diskimage.img
2006-04-21T08:18:00.000Z	linuxgeekery	fatehaze	for snapshot
2006-04-21T08:19:00.000Z	fatehaze	linuxgeekery	how does snapshot work?
2006-04-21T08:20:00.000Z	fatehaze	linuxgeekery	does it make an iso out of the partition?  I have much less free space on my ubuntu partition than my osx partition
2006-04-21T08:21:00.000Z	linuxgeekery	fatehaze	not an iso, but a disk image. well, they're basically the same thing. dd basically recreates the whole disk, byte for byte, in a file
