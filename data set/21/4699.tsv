2008-03-04T05:47:00.000Z	bluefoxx		so, any tutorials on setting up ssh so i can access my comp from any windows computer?
2008-03-04T05:47:00.000Z	thinkpaduser	bluefoxx	 is ssh installed?
2008-03-04T05:48:00.000Z	thinkpaduser	bluefoxx	 if it is, just start it with /etc/init.d/sshd start
2008-03-04T05:48:00.000Z	bluefoxx	thinkpaduser	im looking for  atutorial for it...
2008-03-04T05:49:00.000Z	thinkpaduser	bluefoxx	 sudo apt-get install openssh or ssh or sshd.  i forget which is the Ubuntu package
2008-03-04T05:49:00.000Z	thinkpaduser	bluefoxx	 then /etc/init.d/sshd start
2008-03-04T05:49:00.000Z	thinkpaduser	bluefoxx	 it should config your keys for you on first start
2008-03-04T05:50:00.000Z	thinkpaduser	bluefoxx	 then, as long as iptables or a firewall isn't blocking it, you should be able to connect
2008-03-04T05:50:00.000Z	bluefoxx	thinkpaduser	keys??...this is all new to me...most ive done is tried to connect to another computer on my LAN
2008-03-04T05:52:00.000Z	thinkpaduser	bluefoxx	 did you install an ssh server?
2008-03-04T05:52:00.000Z	thinkpaduser	bluefoxx	 it is REALLY simple
2008-03-04T05:53:00.000Z	bluefoxx	thinkpaduser	ill give it a shot.
2008-03-04T05:53:00.000Z	thinkpaduser	bluefoxx	 install the server (openssh sshd ssh or something) then start the service and you are done
2008-03-04T05:54:00.000Z	thinkpaduser	bluefoxx	 ssh needs secret keys for the 'handshake' but Ubuntu takes care of that automatically, i believe
2008-03-04T05:54:00.000Z	thinkpaduser	bluefoxx	 just run '/etc/init.d/sshd start' and you can connect once the server is installed
2008-03-04T05:54:00.000Z	bluefoxx	thinkpaduser	kk, thanks. i want to be able to listen to my music at school, from my computer XD this will help  right?
2008-03-04T05:55:00.000Z	thinkpaduser	bluefoxx	 um... maybe
2008-03-04T05:55:00.000Z	thinkpaduser	bluefoxx	 you *can* stream tunes through ssh
2008-03-04T05:55:00.000Z	thinkpaduser	bluefoxx	 but you might want to check out mpd or icecast for what you want to do
2008-03-04T05:55:00.000Z	bluefoxx	thinkpaduser	kk
2008-03-04T05:56:00.000Z	thinkpaduser	bluefoxx	 i have never done what you are trying.  ssh will get you in the door to copy stuff, however
