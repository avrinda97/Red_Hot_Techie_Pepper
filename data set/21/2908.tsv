2009-05-17T04:22:00.000Z	andresj_live		hello, I need advice on how big should I make my / partition. I will have a separate /home partition. I install almost every program I can find---altough I am trying to cut back on that. Would 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 GiB be a good size for my / partition? I have 100 GiB of available space for / and /home.
2009-05-17T04:22:00.000Z	mgmuscari	andresj_live	i'm trying to figure out good partition sizes right now too :D
2009-05-17T04:23:00.000Z	mgmuscari	andresj_live	stick around for a few minutes and i'll pastebin you the final partition map i come up with

2009-05-17T04:26:00.000Z	andresj_live	mgmuscari	the release notes scared me out, lol---and there is no easy ext4 -> ext3 path; at least not with the current version of e2fsprogs
2009-05-17T04:26:00.000Z	mgmuscari	andresj_live	from what i understand ext3->ext4 shouldn't be so difficult
2009-05-17T04:27:00.000Z	andresj_live	mgmuscari	no it was quite easy, actually---took like 30secs
2009-05-17T04:27:00.000Z	mgmuscari	andresj_live	makes sense
2009-05-17T04:27:00.000Z	andresj_live	mgmuscari	it was the opposite way which is not supported yet. although it theoretically should be
2009-05-17T04:28:00.000Z	mgmuscari	andresj_live	how big is the drive you're partitioning?
2009-05-17T04:28:00.000Z	andresj_live	mgmuscari	um my drive is 200GiB; 100GiB, however are being used to host old files I just cant delete :P
2009-05-17T04:29:00.000Z	mgmuscari	andresj_live	that makes partitioning trickier; i'm just wiping this 320gb drive that i had several windows installations on. finally broke my marriage to MS by getting a new audio interface that works in linux
2009-05-17T04:30:00.000Z	andresj_live	mgmuscari	hahaha; well yeah, I used fdisk to get rid of the extended partitions I had, and now I'm harnessing the power of GParted to resize/move my 100GiB partition, and create the other two I need.

2009-05-17T04:33:00.000Z	andresj_live	mgmuscari	oh LOL forgot that the names of the ubuntu's versions are actually adjectives :P
2009-05-17T04:49:00.000Z	andresj_live	mgmuscari	not always, really
2009-05-17T04:49:00.000Z	andresj_live	mgmuscari	princess: I think the Virtual Machine Manager would be useful in installing Windows
2009-05-17T04:57:00.000Z	mgmuscari	andresj_live	here's what i ended up with for partition sizes: http://pastebin.com/d236d201d
2009-05-17T04:58:00.000Z	mgmuscari	andresj_live	remember to allocate space for swap :p
