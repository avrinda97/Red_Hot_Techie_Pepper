2009-10-17T01:23:00.000Z	{Onyx}		Am I retarded or is GPG email signing with Evolution broken? Works fine in Thunderbird but Evolution gives an error about not being able to find the private key.
2009-10-17T01:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	{Onyx}	works for me
2009-10-17T01:24:00.000Z	{Onyx}	erUSUL	What version?
2009-10-17T01:24:00.000Z	erUSUL	{Onyx}	jaunty but have allways worked for me and i used every single ubuntu version
2009-10-17T01:25:00.000Z	{Onyx}	erUSUL	Was talking about Evolution version. Because my email encryption works but if I check of to sign the email it fails.
2009-10-17T01:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	{Onyx}	there is one to one correspondence between evolution version and ubuntu version
2009-10-17T01:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	{Onyx}	but is 2.26.1 in jaunty
2009-10-17T01:26:00.000Z	{Onyx}	erUSUL	Hmmm, I'll dig through my settings then because I can't get it to work.
2009-10-17T01:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	{Onyx}	you only have to put the key id in the account preferences
2009-10-17T01:27:00.000Z	{Onyx}	erUSUL	Did
2009-10-17T01:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	{Onyx}	maybe a typo (if it does not encounter the key...)
2009-10-17T01:28:00.000Z	{Onyx}	erUSUL	And the encryption works fine just not the signing and the signing works fine with Thunder
2009-10-17T01:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	{Onyx}	i guess you made a typo when specifying the key id
2009-10-17T01:29:00.000Z	{Onyx}	erUSUL	is there a another spot to put the signing key ID?
2009-10-17T01:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	{Onyx}	encryption uses the recipient key that evo finds via the mail adress but signing needs your secret key id
2009-10-17T01:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	{Onyx}	what do you type as key id ?
2009-10-17T01:30:00.000Z	{Onyx}	erUSUL	Think I found the issue. The key ID is 93ACDC3E and I had a c in front of it.
2009-10-17T01:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	{Onyx}	so I was right ;P cheers
2009-10-17T01:31:00.000Z	{Onyx}	erUSUL	Strange though because I was sending encrypted mail to myself and everything was working fine.
2009-10-17T01:31:00.000Z	{Onyx}	erUSUL	Thanks for getting me to recheck it :)
2009-10-17T01:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	{Onyx}	no problem
