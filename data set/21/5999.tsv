2007-07-20T14:42:00.000Z	metbsd		so what software do you guys use to create business card
2007-07-20T14:43:00.000Z	metbsd		on windows?
2007-07-20T13:28:00.000Z	metbsd		is it possible to install debian first, and then install ubuntu from there
2007-07-20T13:28:00.000Z	metbsd		is it?
2007-07-20T13:29:00.000Z	metbsd		can someone tell me?
2007-07-20T13:30:00.000Z	metbsd		is it possible to install debian first, and then install ubuntu from there???
2007-07-20T13:31:00.000Z	metbsd		maybe it's possible..
2007-07-20T13:31:00.000Z	metbsd		why silly?
2007-07-20T13:31:00.000Z	preaction	metbsd	why would you want to?
2007-07-20T13:32:00.000Z	preaction	metbsd	again, why would you want to? and that will probably break in strange and exciting ways
2007-07-20T13:33:00.000Z	metbsd	preaction	why would i not want to?
2007-07-20T13:33:00.000Z	preaction	metbsd	i'm trying to get a feel for why you'd want to so i can refute your ideas. it will not work
2007-07-20T13:34:00.000Z	preaction	metbsd	they are not binary compatible, it is not a good idea to do this. it is not supported and not recommended, i would not do it. good luck
2007-07-20T13:36:00.000Z	preaction	metbsd	imagine you have windows 3.11 on your computer, and then you just copy the contents of the windows 95 install disk onto your computer and then reboot. what will happen?
2007-07-20T13:36:00.000Z	preaction	metbsd	sure, you put the system directory in the right place, but it's already full of windows 3.11 libs. now you've got 3.11 programs using 95 libs and 95 programs using 3.11 libs.
2007-07-20T13:38:00.000Z	preaction	metbsd	admittedly, that's a more extreme example, but the collolary is the same: you've got debian programs using ubuntu libs, debian programs compiled against debian libs that now have ubuntu libs in their place. there WILL be incompatibilities, and there WILL be inconsistencies
2007-07-20T13:38:00.000Z	preaction	metbsd	that's because the netinstall disc puts nothing onto your hard drive that does not come from the internet.
2007-07-20T13:39:00.000Z	preaction	metbsd	i would not recommend it.
2007-07-20T13:39:00.000Z	preaction	metbsd	for the simple reason that it has not been tested and is not supported by either team.
2007-07-20T13:41:00.000Z	preaction	metbsd	go ahead and try it, but do not expect support for your frankenstienian monster
2007-07-20T13:41:00.000Z	preaction	metbsd	i gave you an exact reason: binary incompatibility
