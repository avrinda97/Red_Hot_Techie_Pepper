2009-01-24T13:55:00.000Z	olivier_		does someone know of vnc connection problems ?
2009-01-24T13:56:00.000Z	olivier_		I can't connect with vnc to my remote box and I don't know why
2009-01-24T13:56:00.000Z	ein2015	olivier_	is the remote box behind on the same network?
2009-01-24T13:57:00.000Z	ein2015	olivier_	do you know if it's behind a NAT?
2009-01-24T13:59:00.000Z	ein2015	olivier_	sounds like it might be a configuration error on the other end
2009-01-24T14:00:00.000Z	ein2015	olivier_	how so?
2009-01-24T14:01:00.000Z	ein2015	olivier_	what OS is your other PC?
2009-01-24T14:04:00.000Z	ein2015	olivier_	use pastebin
2009-01-24T14:04:00.000Z	ein2015	olivier_	now paste me the link :)
2009-01-24T14:08:00.000Z	ein2015	olivier_	yeah one sec
2009-01-24T14:09:00.000Z	ein2015	olivier_	i found a good way to do it with the GUI, just gotta figure out how to do it with the CLI now ;)
2009-01-24T14:10:00.000Z	ein2015	olivier_	i assumed :)
2009-01-24T14:13:00.000Z	ein2015	olivier_	is port 5901 forwarded to that IP in the network?
2009-01-24T14:14:00.000Z	ein2015	olivier_	i doubt it's your client, those are really hard to mess up (i think)
2009-01-24T14:17:00.000Z	ein2015	olivier_	it'd be in the logs somewhere, but if you're getting a timeout problem then i dont know
2009-01-24T14:19:00.000Z	ein2015	olivier_	about one of the only ideas i can come up with then is just to make sure you've followed the instructions offered here... although they seem possibly out of date :\ http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=122402
2009-01-24T14:19:00.000Z	ein2015	olivier_	i'm trying to find more up-to-date instructions
2009-01-24T14:21:00.000Z	ein2015	olivier_	try this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=795036&highlight=VNC
2009-01-24T14:26:00.000Z	olivier_	ein2015	do you know about tools like ethereal ?
2009-01-24T14:26:00.000Z	ein2015	olivier_	heard of them... havent used 'em
2009-01-24T14:27:00.000Z	ein2015	olivier_	the instructions i linked to arent that complicated though.  i'd recommend it... but that's just me
