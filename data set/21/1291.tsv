2011-02-09T10:43:00.000Z	Jon--		Easy question : How do I echo $term?
2011-02-09T10:45:00.000Z	Jon--		Okay.. how do I set TERM permanently then? I want to use "xterm-256color" for a 256 color VIM color-scheme.

2011-02-09T10:48:00.000Z	Jon--	lithpr	I'd like 256 colour support. How do I get this? I know that it's supported, I saw a post on Ubuntu forums saying do this: export TERM="xterm-256color"  but this does not seem to work any more.

2011-02-09T10:50:00.000Z	Jon--	lithpr	Do you not know how to do this then?
2011-02-09T10:51:00.000Z	lithpr		i'm playing with it... Jon-- how could one tell if one had a 256 color term?
2011-02-09T10:51:00.000Z	Jon--	lithpr	I can tell because my vim colorscheme requires it and looks like crap without it.. ;)
2011-02-09T10:53:00.000Z	lithpr		hmmm... well, after i did exactly what you said, i have some obnoxious syntax highlighting in nano
2011-02-09T10:54:00.000Z	lithpr		and exporting back to xterm doesn't seem to help
2011-02-09T10:54:00.000Z	lithpr		so, i am no help
2011-02-09T10:54:00.000Z	lithpr		except the echo $TERM part :)
2011-02-09T10:55:00.000Z	lithpr	Jon--	do you get pretty colors when you "ls -la"?
2011-02-09T10:56:00.000Z	Jon--	lithpr	It should really only affect vim colour schemes. The assumption for most other things is that you aren't using 256-colors.
2011-02-09T10:57:00.000Z	lithpr		find /lib/terminfo /usr/share/terminfo -name "*256*"

2011-02-09T10:58:00.000Z	lithpr		oic - Jon-- , yeah, when i do that "tput colors" i get 8
2011-02-09T10:59:00.000Z	lithpr		export TERM="xterm-256color"
2011-02-09T10:59:00.000Z	lithpr		tput colors
2011-02-09T10:59:00.000Z	lithpr		256
2011-02-09T10:59:00.000Z	Jon--	lithpr	Yep, got it, like I said issue was I was doing export $TERM  the $ is not needed.
