2007-03-11T09:23:00.000Z	mike930		can someone help me configure my rt61 wireless card setup script at start up? for some reason it wont load all my iwconfig commands in init.d/rt61up
2007-03-11T09:25:00.000Z	mike930		anyone know anything about rt61 cards?
2007-03-11T09:25:00.000Z	bulmer	mike930	did you try to get it working manually first before using init.d?
2007-03-11T09:26:00.000Z	mike930	bulmer	yeah it works fine, but when I start up it wont load
2007-03-11T09:26:00.000Z	bulmer	mike930	what do you mean when you start up? manually?
2007-03-11T09:27:00.000Z	mike930	bulmer	when I start up I want it to automatically load up the card and connect to the router. When I start up though, when I iwconfig none of the setting are stored
2007-03-11T09:29:00.000Z	bulmer	mike930	your settings are not stored? check your script carefully
2007-03-11T09:30:00.000Z	mike930	bulmer	everything in the script seems to be ok, it was all copied and pasted into the startup script
2007-03-11T09:31:00.000Z	bulmer	mike930	you can have your script debug but putting a -x option on your script at the top
2007-03-11T09:32:00.000Z	mike930	bulmer	what will that do during start up? will it just step through it like normal code debug?
2007-03-11T09:33:00.000Z	bulmer	mike930	yeah, i hope so..but you can test it without rebooting, go to single user and back to multi-user
2007-03-11T09:33:00.000Z	mike930	bulmer	what do you mean?
2007-03-11T09:34:00.000Z	bulmer	mike930	you can always test your script ..run it manually
2007-03-11T09:34:00.000Z	bulmer	mike930	as in /etc/init.d/rt61 restart or start..assuming you follow the chkconfig format..
2007-03-11T09:36:00.000Z	mike930	bulmer	when I run it it goes through the script ending with dhclient ra0, seems to be running normal when I run it
2007-03-11T09:38:00.000Z	bulmer	mike930	put a comment to spit it out to the /var/log/messages so you know your script runs right?
2007-03-11T09:40:00.000Z	mike930	bulmer	i don't need to do that, because when it runs through it comes back saying the process id already exist...
2007-03-11T09:42:00.000Z	bulmer	mike930	dont forget that the other network related scripts may already be running dhcpclient..
2007-03-11T09:42:00.000Z	mike930	bulmer	can i put them in the network/interface would it run?
2007-03-11T09:43:00.000Z	bulmer	mike930	sure try it, thats the way its supposed to be anyways,
2007-03-11T09:45:00.000Z	mike930	bulmer	thanks, I'm going to restart and try it now
