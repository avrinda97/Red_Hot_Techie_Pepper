2010-08-30T19:44:00.000Z	Kaolc	jrib	I already read it..
2010-08-30T19:45:00.000Z	jrib	Kaolc	and?...
2010-08-30T19:45:00.000Z	Kaolc	jrib	apparently the port isn't open or something
2010-08-30T19:45:00.000Z	jrib	Kaolc	"or something"?
2010-08-30T19:45:00.000Z	jrib	Kaolc	ok...
2010-08-30T19:48:00.000Z	jrib	Kaolc	if you read the link ubottu tells you, you will see how to tunnel vnc over ssh...
2010-08-30T20:12:00.000Z	jrib	Kaolc	answer hasn't changed since last time you asked...
2010-08-30T20:12:00.000Z	jrib	Kaolc	why not?
2010-08-30T20:12:00.000Z	jrib	Kaolc	I answered you
2010-08-30T20:12:00.000Z	jrib	Kaolc	yes.  I told you that if you would read the link, it tells you how to vnc over ssh
2010-08-30T20:13:00.000Z	Kaolc	jrib	I TRIED. Didn't work out.
2010-08-30T20:14:00.000Z	jrib	Kaolc	what didn't work exactly?
2010-08-30T20:15:00.000Z	Kaolc	jrib	I'm not sure what didn't work out. I followed the tutorial and well, messed up somehow. I'll try xming then
2010-08-30T20:21:00.000Z	jrib	Kaolc	ubuntu server doesn't have X by default (and runs a -server kernel)
2010-08-30T20:21:00.000Z	jrib	Kaolc	check what kernel you are running
2010-08-30T20:22:00.000Z	jrib	Kaolc	uname -r
2010-08-30T20:23:00.000Z	jrib	Kaolc	what ubuntu version is this? That's not a standard kernel
2010-08-30T20:23:00.000Z	jrib	Kaolc	address people you are responding to please
