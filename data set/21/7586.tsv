2007-04-18T08:25:00.000Z	wastrel	KevinOO	 everything looks ok, ... is there another machine on the LAN using that IP address ?
2007-04-18T08:26:00.000Z	wastrel		(grasping at straws here... :)
2007-04-18T08:26:00.000Z	KevinOO	wastrel	nope just checked
2007-04-18T08:26:00.000Z	wastrel	KevinOO	 if you boot from the livecd does the network card work?  how about if you set up eth0 for dhcp?
2007-04-18T08:27:00.000Z	wastrel	KevinOO	 how about reloading the driver
2007-04-18T08:27:00.000Z	KevinOO	wastrel	Im not sure if  can use dhcp, my router is set up for static

2007-04-18T08:27:00.000Z	wastrel	KevinOO	 oic, no dhcp server.  what a concept :] 
2007-04-18T08:28:00.000Z	KevinOO	wastrel	I do not know how to reload the driver
2007-04-18T08:28:00.000Z	wastrel	KevinOO	 lsmod, rmmod, modprobe  stuff like that
2007-04-18T08:28:00.000Z	wastrel		reboot would work too i suppose
2007-04-18T08:30:00.000Z	KevinOO	wastrel	I have no idea what arguments to use with modprobe
2007-04-18T08:31:00.000Z	KevinOO	wastrel	ehternet controller shows up with lspci
2007-04-18T08:31:00.000Z	wastrel	KevinOO	 yeah it won't help :] 
2007-04-18T08:32:00.000Z	wastrel	KevinOO	 ok so your card appears to be configured correctly but it's just not working
2007-04-18T08:32:00.000Z	KevinOO		right
2007-04-18T08:32:00.000Z	wastrel	KevinOO	 do you have a different network cable you could try?
