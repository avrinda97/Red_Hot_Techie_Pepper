2010-12-18T19:28:00.000Z	Jemt		Hi. How do I get rid of gnome-utils, without removing ubuntu-desktop ?
2010-12-18T19:30:00.000Z	coz_	Jemt	  out of curiosity....why do you want to remove them?
2010-12-18T19:31:00.000Z	Jemt	coz_	I'm remastering Ubuntu. I'm creating an ISO with a minimum of software, and I don't want e.g. gnome-dictionary to show up in the application menu
2010-12-18T19:31:00.000Z	coz_	Jemt	  I am wondering if you can control what shows up in the menu ahead of time  by editing it with alacarte
2010-12-18T19:32:00.000Z	coz_	Jemt	  although I havent tried ,,, it seems that by editing alacarte and which menu items will be in there should transfer over to the iso
2010-12-18T19:32:00.000Z	Jemt	coz_	Perhaps, but removing the software I don't want is prefered :)
2010-12-18T19:33:00.000Z	coz_	Jemt	  not sure then  ... You may want to scoot over the #gnome on the server or the official one on  gimpnet  #gnome
2010-12-18T19:33:00.000Z	coz_	Jemt	 are you using remastersys?
2010-12-18T19:34:00.000Z	Jemt	coz_	I don't believe this is a problem related to Gnome. After all, gnome-utils depends on ubuntu-desktop which has nothing to do with Gnome :)
2010-12-18T19:34:00.000Z	Jemt	coz_	Nope, doing it by hand
2010-12-18T19:34:00.000Z	Jemt	coz_	Extracting ISO, chrooting, etc
2010-12-18T19:34:00.000Z	coz_	Jemt	  mmm.... then I am at aloss to help then,, I have not done this is for quite a while
2010-12-18T19:35:00.000Z	Jemt	coz_	Okay, thanks anyways, I appreciate it :)
2011-04-17T16:42:00.000Z	coz_	Jemt	 that seems reasonable to assume ..yes
2011-04-17T16:42:00.000Z	coz_	Jemt	  ignore what I just said,, Dr_Willis  is most likely correct about this since I nearly never use  ati
2011-04-17T16:43:00.000Z	coz_	Jemt	 the real issue would be  intel / nvidia
2011-04-17T16:43:00.000Z	Jemt	coz_	Why ?
2011-04-17T16:44:00.000Z	coz_	Jemt	  intel / nvidia drivers on the same system  have produced some very strange  outcomes....one is desktop is completely upside down and reversed
2011-04-17T16:44:00.000Z	coz_	Jemt	 at least that situation the system worked  if you stood on your head :)
2011-04-17T16:44:00.000Z	Jemt	coz_	Crazy :)
2011-04-17T16:44:00.000Z	coz_	Jemt	 and in that situation the best solution would be to remove the nvidia driver
