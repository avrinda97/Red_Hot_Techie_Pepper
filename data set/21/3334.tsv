2009-01-23T03:51:00.000Z	Deany		I use clonezilla to do full disk (dual boot) all the time, never let me down
2009-01-23T03:51:00.000Z	Deany		clonezilla live boots quicker than ubuntu live, obviously.. 1 more reason..
2009-01-23T03:51:00.000Z	Heliodor1	Deany	Is it a live cd?
2009-01-23T03:51:00.000Z	Deany	Heliodor1	yup

2009-01-23T03:56:00.000Z	Heliodor1	Deany	Do you know if clonezilla can restore to a larger drive?
2009-01-23T03:56:00.000Z	Heliodor1	Deany	Am gonna try and backup the single-disk and then create a RAID and then restore to that.
2009-01-23T03:59:00.000Z	Heliodor1	Deany	Thank you! it says "clonezilla server" do i have to set up a server? :-O

2009-01-23T04:01:00.000Z	Heliodor1	Deany	Ah, so clonezilla is mentioned as clonezilla server then?

2009-01-23T04:02:00.000Z	Heliodor1	Deany	Good, super! Thanks for the help :)
2009-01-23T04:02:00.000Z	Heliodor1	Deany	Do you know if the live iso is compatible with RAID controllers?
2009-01-23T04:03:00.000Z	Deany	Heliodor1	no idea.
2009-01-23T04:04:00.000Z	Deany	Heliodor1	ignore that, he thought you were talkin about ubuntu
2009-01-23T04:15:00.000Z	Deany	Heliodor1	it doesnt defrag, it just stores files more intelligent than ntfs
