2008-01-09T17:02:00.000Z	demitri	moidekar	what would be the OLD PASSWORD..?
2008-01-09T17:05:00.000Z	demitri	moidekar	i tried typeing smbpasswd -a demitri but it showed me a list of options.
2008-01-09T17:07:00.000Z	moidekar	demitri	Weird, it doesn't ask me anything except for password for the user. You have already added the Linux system account of the same name with useradd (or other util of your choice), right?
2008-01-09T17:07:00.000Z	demitri	moidekar	demitri is my account
2008-01-09T17:08:00.000Z	moidekar	demitri	you are running the smbpasswd as root, right? Sorry, forgot to mention
2008-01-09T17:08:00.000Z	demitri	moidekar	i'm very new to this by the way
2008-01-09T17:08:00.000Z	demitri	moidekar	no
2008-01-09T17:08:00.000Z	moidekar	demitri	-a is only avble to root
2008-01-09T17:09:00.000Z	demitri	moidekar	ok it worked now. the smbpasswd thing
2008-01-09T17:09:00.000Z	demitri	moidekar	now what should i do..? log-in from WINDOWS..?
2008-01-09T17:09:00.000Z	moidekar	demitri	great, now restart the smb service (just for luck) ;-) and try connection from your windows machine...
2008-01-09T17:12:00.000Z	moidekar	demitri	/etc/init.d/smb restart should do it; then at your windows machine, try opening a Windows Explorer window
2008-01-09T17:12:00.000Z	demitri	moidekar	ok done!
2008-01-09T17:13:00.000Z	moidekar	demitri	In the Windows Explorer window, type \\machine_name (your Linux system's hostname) or \\IP_Address_of_Linux_machine
2008-01-09T17:13:00.000Z	moidekar	demitri	Anything showing up?
2008-01-09T17:14:00.000Z	moidekar	demitri	you may need to edit /etc/samba/smb.conf (the shares section) to share certain folders from your Linux machine.
2008-01-09T17:14:00.000Z	demitri	moidekar	ok hold
2008-01-09T17:15:00.000Z	demitri	moidekar	it worked.
2008-01-09T17:15:00.000Z	moidekar	demitri	If you use KDE then I think there is a utility in one of the control panels to graphically set up shares... but I usually edit the conf file :-)
2008-01-09T17:15:00.000Z	demitri	moidekar	it worked just from the previouse steps you gave me. thnks.
2008-01-09T17:15:00.000Z	demitri	moidekar	thanks !
