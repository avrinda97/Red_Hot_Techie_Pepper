2009-11-30T00:42:00.000Z	jadakren	LimCore	suggestion : freeNX or maybe the linux version of rDesktop = xcrmdcp
2009-11-30T00:43:00.000Z	LimCore	jadakren	 "xcrmdcp" ?
2009-11-30T00:43:00.000Z	jadakren	LimCore	allows you to run X over ssh
2009-11-30T00:43:00.000Z	jadakren	LimCore	pendantic
2009-11-30T00:43:00.000Z	LimCore	jadakren	what?
2009-11-30T00:43:00.000Z	jadakren	LimCore	you are being pendantic
2009-11-30T00:44:00.000Z	LimCore	jadakren	you told me to use "xcrmdcp" and there is no such thing.
2009-11-30T00:44:00.000Z	LimCore	jadakren	what you wanted to say previously? perhaps you made a typo
2009-11-30T00:44:00.000Z	jadakren	LimCore	http://tldp.org/HOWTO/XDMCP-HOWTO/index.html
2009-11-30T00:45:00.000Z	jadakren	LimCore	you know of this ? using xMing on windows you can running linux apps remotely
2009-11-30T00:46:00.000Z	LimCore	jadakren	I need thist only for  linux -> linux actually.  From linux A  I want to use X applications on linux B.  I can use ssh -X but I do not get the "desktop" thing, thats only problem
2009-11-30T00:46:00.000Z	jadakren	LimCore	will still work. but one thing first : are you aware of what the ssh + screen combo is for ?
2009-11-30T00:47:00.000Z	LimCore	jadakren	what do you mean?  We want to run graphicall applications
2009-11-30T00:47:00.000Z	jadakren	LimCore	i know. but you can't maintain sessions with xdcmp like you can with screen
2009-11-30T00:47:00.000Z	jadakren	LimCore	or like you can with rdesktop
2009-11-30T00:48:00.000Z	LimCore	jadakren	you mean that the session will close on server when client disconnects? that is fine
2009-11-30T00:48:00.000Z	jadakren	LimCore	google : ubuntu xdmcp howto
2009-11-30T00:49:00.000Z	LimCore	jadakren	Im a bit lazy to be honest, but I know a lot about overall linux; can you just give me what to type on server and what to type on client if you remember it?
2009-11-30T00:50:00.000Z	jadakren	LimCore	no. been a long time.
2009-11-30T00:50:00.000Z	jadakren	LimCore	i'm lazy too
