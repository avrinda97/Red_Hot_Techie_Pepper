2007-05-03T12:40:00.000Z	mon^rch	source	it "feels" smoother... beryl has more "toys" and a better config..
2007-05-03T12:41:00.000Z	mon^rch	source	nods
2007-05-03T12:42:00.000Z	mon^rch	source	compiz will keep its name and have a fork called compiz-comm or something like that
2007-05-03T12:42:00.000Z	mon^rch	source	stick with compiz... it's plenty eye candy ;)
2007-05-03T12:45:00.000Z	mon^rch	source	compiz is already part of ubuntu :)
2007-05-03T12:46:00.000Z	mon^rch	source	you DO need opengl drivers installed...
2007-05-03T12:48:00.000Z	mon^rch	source	just use the ubuntu nvidia-glx package :)
2007-05-03T12:50:00.000Z	mon^rch	source	make sure you install the restricted modules for your running kernel TOO
2007-05-03T12:50:00.000Z	mon^rch	source	I use gqview...
2007-05-03T12:52:00.000Z	mon^rch	source	open synaptic and search for "linux-restricted" and pick the one that matches the kernel you are running...
