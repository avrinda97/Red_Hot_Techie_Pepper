2007-09-30T15:57:00.000Z	slicks_mage		ok brb
2007-09-30T15:58:00.000Z	slicks_mage		wont let me click the button :|
2007-09-30T15:58:00.000Z	geo-rge	slicks_mage	personally, I have no idea... but also, you might collect some info on a web page... so far, what have you said besides "doesn't work"?
2007-09-30T15:59:00.000Z	slicks_mage		ummmm well besides saying stuff doesn't work ive been asking about how to fix them but no answers for example ive been asking about wireless and no1 answered
2007-09-30T16:00:00.000Z	slicks_mage		all ive been trying to do was get wireless working
2007-09-30T16:00:00.000Z	slicks_mage		:|
2007-09-30T16:00:00.000Z	geo-rge	slicks_mage	is wireless the only issue right now?
2007-09-30T16:02:00.000Z	geo-rge	slicks_mage	they want to help you... so far they just have to guess... give em a break
2007-09-30T16:02:00.000Z	slicks_mage		know what, instead of replying to a million people and starting arguements im gonna pull the plug and reboot and uninstall wut ive been trying
2007-09-30T16:03:00.000Z	geo-rge	slicks_mage	which may or may not fix things, plus if you pull the plug you could damage things
2007-09-30T16:04:00.000Z	geo-rge		I wouldn't put it past anyone
2007-10-01T16:04:00.000Z	geo-rge		perhaps it could be perceived as a weakness as opposed to an appliance such as a lightbulb... you can turn on and off a light without damaging the filesystem of its large hd :)
2007-10-01T16:05:00.000Z	geo-rge		admittedly, the analogy loses relevence since lightbulbs don't have many moving parts
2007-10-01T16:06:00.000Z	geo-rge		that would be an edge/corner case :P
2007-10-01T16:06:00.000Z	geo-rge	slicks_mage	so can you click now?
2007-10-01T16:07:00.000Z	slicks_mage		bak lets start from the top
2007-10-01T16:07:00.000Z	slicks_mage		yea i can
2007-10-01T16:08:00.000Z	geo-rge		ok, so I'm trying to get back on-topic then: btw, is xen on topic?
2007-10-01T16:08:00.000Z	geo-rge		and support for ubuntu using xen?
2007-10-01T16:08:00.000Z	slicks_mage	geo-rge	what do i do first to try to get wireless working on ubuntu?
