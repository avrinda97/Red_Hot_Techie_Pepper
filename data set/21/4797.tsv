2008-02-08T06:52:00.000Z	Sunman		sorry to keep bothering you guys. for some reason after a few reboots the livecd worked. how do i mount my hd and how do i run fsck just on that mounted hd.
2008-02-08T06:52:00.000Z	nickrud	Sunman	first, you don't run fsck on a mounted drive.  Second,  sudo fsck /dev/<device>
2008-02-08T06:53:00.000Z	Sunman	nickrud	then how do i run fsck without mounting it?
2008-02-08T07:00:00.000Z	Sunman	nickrud	i have three devices sda1 - linux, sda2 "extended" and sda 5 "linux swap". fsck only runs on the first one... which one is my hd?
2008-02-08T07:02:00.000Z	nickrud	Sunman	they are all your hard disk. sda1 is the partition where linux is installed, sda2 is a container for logical partitions, and sda5 is the partition that is used for memory swap. Only the first needs fscking
2008-02-08T07:08:00.000Z	Sunman	nickrud	thanks. well, it came up clean. now i am just confused.
2008-02-08T07:13:00.000Z	nickrud	Sunman	sorry, you scrolled off and I forgot who I wanted to talk to :) What's the error?
2008-02-08T07:13:00.000Z	nickrud	Sunman	what's the complete error? on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2008-02-08T07:16:00.000Z	Sunman	nickrud	so the fsck /dev/sda1 came out clean. fsck /dev/hda returned this: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/55162/
2008-02-08T07:17:00.000Z	nickrud	Sunman	hda is the entire disk, not a partition. it is not fsck'able
2008-02-08T07:17:00.000Z	nickrud	Sunman	so, back to the real issue: You can't boot?
2008-02-08T07:19:00.000Z	nickrud	Sunman	does windows boot?
2008-02-08T07:19:00.000Z	Sunman	nickrud	i dont have windows.
2008-02-08T07:19:00.000Z	nickrud	Sunman	so, you have to have some kind of error.
2008-02-08T07:20:00.000Z	Sunman	nickrud	what do you mean? yes : "Error 16:Inconsistent filesystem"
2008-02-08T07:22:00.000Z	nickrud	Sunman	and when you    sudo fsck /dev/hda1 , what do you get?
2008-02-08T07:22:00.000Z	nickrud	Sunman	put /boot/grub/menu.lst on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2008-02-08T07:23:00.000Z	Sunman	nickrud	wait a second i think it just randomly started working. i ran a recovery mode with the previous kernel and it went through. after i tried to do the very same thing at least 10 times earlier. this system works in mysterious ways
2008-02-08T07:25:00.000Z	Sunman	nickrud	well, everything worked. all of a sudden. with no clear explanation as to what the hell was happening to it for the last few hours. *shrug*
2008-02-08T07:25:00.000Z	nickrud	Sunman	lol, you did something right in your flailing.
2008-02-08T07:26:00.000Z	Sunman	nickrud	well hopefully, it wont happen again. thanks!
