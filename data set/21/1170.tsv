2011-01-09T22:34:00.000Z	zootcat	witwolf	about your command: what is duluge in your sudoers?
2011-01-09T22:34:00.000Z	zootcat	witwolf	is it Host_Alias?
2011-01-09T22:35:00.000Z	witwolf	zootcat	I am not sure
2011-01-09T22:35:00.000Z	zootcat	witwolf	so you wanna run deluge without passwd + sudo?
2011-01-09T22:36:00.000Z	zootcat	witwolf	try something like: Cmnd_Alias DELUGE=/usr/bin/deluge
2011-01-09T22:36:00.000Z	zootcat	witwolf	Host_Alias LOCAL=your_host_name
2011-01-09T22:36:00.000Z	zootcat	witwolf	USer_Alias is not needed
2011-01-09T22:37:00.000Z	witwolf	zootcat	Yes I would like to do that. I have a bash script run an me. this is the command: sudo -H -u deluge flexget --feed=MyTracker --inject "$filename" "$HTTPDownloadLocation$filenameWithoutSpaces$TorrentExtension" --cli-config "path=$directory"
2011-01-09T22:37:00.000Z	zootcat	witwolf	and then ALL  ALL = (your_host) NOPASSD: DELUGE
2011-01-09T22:39:00.000Z	witwolf	zootcat	maybe I should rather try the ssh option
2011-01-09T22:40:00.000Z	zootcat	witwolf	of course you can, but that's kinda *stupid* =) sudo works flawlessly
2011-01-09T22:40:00.000Z	zootcat	witwolf	you can try reading man for sudoers, there are a lot of examples
2011-01-09T22:40:00.000Z	zootcat	witwolf	or define a user User_Alias FULLTIMERS = you
2011-01-09T22:40:00.000Z	witwolf	zootcat	I have used sudoers serveral times, but for some reason I cant get it to work today
2011-01-09T22:41:00.000Z	zootcat	witwolf	and do: FULLTIMERS YOUR_HOST = NOPASSWD: DELUGE
2011-01-09T22:41:00.000Z	zootcat	witwolf	BTW, I used to have a problem. make sure there is a space after NOPASSWD:
2011-01-09T22:42:00.000Z	zootcat	witwolf	and do not put more, than 2 coomand in one line
2011-01-09T22:46:00.000Z	zootcat	witwolf	let's say, you want your process to be owned by other user
2011-01-09T22:46:00.000Z	zootcat	witwolf	so, you'd rather use su -c this time (upstart script or something)
2011-01-09T22:47:00.000Z	witwolf	zootcat	could I pvt? struggeling to read between the lines.
2011-01-09T22:47:00.000Z	zootcat	witwolf	yep
