2008-12-21T15:55:00.000Z	harlemdavvey		i need some help with mounting an usb storage device!
2008-12-21T15:56:00.000Z	harlemdavvey		no, it doesn't
2008-12-21T15:56:00.000Z	harlemdavvey		 :(

2008-12-21T15:58:00.000Z	harlemdavvey		well, yes
2008-12-21T15:58:00.000Z	harlemdavvey		i tried mounting it with sg_scan -i
2008-12-21T15:58:00.000Z	harlemdavvey		but my ubuntu doesn't want to access the storage device
2008-12-21T16:00:00.000Z	harlemdavvey		:(
2008-12-21T16:01:00.000Z	harlemdavvey		yes rmn
2008-12-21T16:01:00.000Z	harlemdavvey		there is not an error
2008-12-21T16:02:00.000Z	rmn	harlemdavvey	tried as root?
2008-12-21T15:56:00.000Z	rmn	harlemdavvey	 doesn't it do that automatically?
2008-12-21T15:56:00.000Z	rmn	harlemdavvey	which version of ubuntu?
2008-12-21T15:57:00.000Z	rmn	harlemdavvey	and it's a regular usb-device?
2008-12-21T15:57:00.000Z	harlemdavvey	rmn	it's a music player, but it's not an ipod
2008-12-21T15:58:00.000Z	harlemdavvey	rmn	it mounts on win
2008-12-21T15:58:00.000Z	rmn	harlemdavvey	so it can be considered a regular USB storage device
2008-12-21T16:00:00.000Z	harlemdavvey	rmn	i tried to set the kernel up by terminal to mount the volume, but there's nothing to do
2008-12-21T16:01:00.000Z	rmn	harlemdavvey	so mount /device /mnt/mydisk fails?
2008-12-21T16:01:00.000Z	rmn	harlemdavvey	with what error
2008-12-21T16:02:00.000Z	rmn	harlemdavvey	and tried on another OS?
