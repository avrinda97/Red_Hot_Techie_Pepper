2009-03-07T10:17:00.000Z	trapline91		Can someone help me out real quick. I have all the restricted drivers installed for playing DVD's but when I start to play a DVD it seems like my computer freezes up and won't play
2009-03-07T10:18:00.000Z	trapline91		I have never been able to get a dvd to play
2009-03-07T10:18:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	trapline91	have you installed dvdcss2 from the Mediabuntu repo?
2009-03-07T10:18:00.000Z	trapline91	ZykoticK9	Don't think so, never heard of it
2009-03-07T10:19:00.000Z	trapline91	ZykoticK9	Where do i get dvdcss2
2009-03-07T10:19:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	trapline91	see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Medibuntu for details, good luck
2009-03-07T10:26:00.000Z	trapline91	ZykoticK9	Ok now it plays for a little while without freezing but I then get "An error occured - Failed to connect stream: OK"
2009-03-07T10:34:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	trapline91	did you install libdvdcss2?
2009-03-07T10:34:00.000Z	trapline91	ZykoticK9	Yes
2009-03-07T10:35:00.000Z	trapline91	ZykoticK9	But I think the problem has to do with my fstab configuration since I don't see my second DVD player in it
2009-03-07T10:35:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	trapline91	do you have "mplayer" installed on your system?  if so try "mplayer dvd://1" -- nothing to do with fstab for dvd playback really, dvd's aren't really mounted to play them.
2009-03-07T10:36:00.000Z	trapline91	ZykoticK9	Can't find it
2009-03-07T10:36:00.000Z	trapline91	ZykoticK9	It doesn't seem to find my DVD in my second DVD player only in my first
2009-03-07T10:36:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	trapline91	libdvdcss2??? what can't you find?
2009-03-07T10:37:00.000Z	trapline91	ZykoticK9	Its not reconizing the DVD in my dvd player
2009-03-07T10:37:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	trapline91	so you can play dvds in one drive and not the other???  just trying to get some clarification.
2009-03-07T10:37:00.000Z	trapline91	ZykoticK9	correct
2009-03-07T10:39:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	trapline91	OK the problem is that /dev/dvd is a pointer to a specific drive if you do "ls -l /dev/dvd" it will show you which physical drive it's pointing too.  but if you can play in one drive - i'm done.  good luck man.
2009-03-07T10:40:00.000Z	trapline91	ZykoticK9	how do i point it to the other drive
2009-03-07T10:40:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	trapline91	sorry man i'm done, someone else might help with that.
2009-03-07T10:40:00.000Z	trapline91	ZykoticK9	thanks for your help :D
