2010-10-04T18:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	phanindraramesh_	 a user might not be able to run the shutdown command..
2010-10-04T18:41:00.000Z	phanindraramesh_	Dr_Willis	what shall i do to run the command?
2010-10-04T18:41:00.000Z	phanindraramesh_	Dr_Willis	what shall i do to run the shutdown command?
2010-10-04T18:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	phanindraramesh_	 never needed to..  you can make cron jobs that run as the root user i belive...
2010-10-04T18:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	phanindraramesh_	 your use of the term 'for every user' makes no sence.. if the pc shutdowns.. its down...
2012-06-05T14:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	phanindraramesh_	 you did do a ./configure first?
2012-06-05T14:21:00.000Z	phanindraramesh_	Dr_Willis	yeah. I did
2012-06-05T14:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	phanindraramesh_	 perhaps it failed
2012-06-05T14:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	phanindraramesh_	 id run the ./configure again and see if it has any errors
2012-06-05T14:24:00.000Z	phanindraramesh_	Dr_Willis	I have done it again. But the same error again
2012-06-05T14:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	phanindraramesh_	 pay attention to its output
2012-06-05T14:26:00.000Z	phanindraramesh_	Dr_Willis	, ./configure gave no errors. hjave a look at it http://pastebin.com/8JNjzgUf
2012-06-11T15:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	phanindraramesh_	 i just copy mine to my .fonts directory ;)
2012-06-11T15:00:00.000Z	phanindraramesh_	Dr_Willis	if I do so. Will I be able to find out the reason why it is not getting installed?
2012-06-11T15:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	phanindraramesh_	 no idea. try to load it and see if it works.  ive never tried any other  'installers' for ttf fonts.
2012-06-11T15:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	phanindraramesh_	 you could run fontviewer from a terminal, and try to load/install the font and look for error messages in the terminal
2012-06-11T15:03:00.000Z	phanindraramesh_	Dr_Willis	what is the command to run fontviewer from a terminal?
2012-06-11T15:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	phanindraramesh_	 no idea.
2012-06-11T15:05:00.000Z	phanindraramesh_	Dr_Willis	gnome-font-viewer worked for me
