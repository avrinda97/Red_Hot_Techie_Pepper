2006-08-24T11:08:00.000Z	lupine_85		then just unpack, make oldconfig, make menuconfig
2006-08-24T11:09:00.000Z	lupine_85		make oldconfig does that automagically
2006-08-24T11:09:00.000Z	lupine_85		assuming that it's not in /proc
2006-08-24T11:10:00.000Z	lupine_85		in /usr/src
2006-08-24T11:10:00.000Z	lupine_85		as a tarball, IIRC
2006-08-24T11:10:00.000Z	lupine_85		once you've untar'd it, it'll be in /usr/src/linux-source-(whatever)
2006-08-24T11:11:00.000Z	lupine_85		bit silly of the tarball to automatically go there, then ;)
2006-08-24T11:12:00.000Z	harisund	lupine_85	the tarball automatically goes there? hmmm.... I generally use -C when untarring anything anyway :)
2006-08-25T09:33:00.000Z	lupine_85	harisund	there isn't a file
2006-08-25T10:48:00.000Z	harisund	lupine_85	run what as root?
2006-09-27T05:43:00.000Z	lupine_85	harisund	for most things, yes
2006-09-27T05:44:00.000Z	harisund	lupine_85	So I am guessing I could do 192.168.0.127/12 ?
2006-09-27T05:44:00.000Z	lupine_85	harisund	erm, if your network is that broken then yes
2006-09-27T05:45:00.000Z	harisund	lupine_85	So I am guessing I could do 192.168.0.128/12, I mean .. Here's my thing. I have my DHCP server setup to hand IP address from 192.168.10.2 to 192.168.10.127 to known hosts, and 192.168.10.129 to 192.168.10.254 to unknown hosts. And I want to use iptables rules for the unknown hosts. So what I mentioned is possible?
2006-09-27T05:45:00.000Z	lupine_85	harisund	a better solution would be to use two different networks
2006-09-27T05:46:00.000Z	harisund	lupine_85	my eth1 (LAN NIC) IP is 192.168.10.1 Will it work if I have two different /24 subnets?
2006-09-27T05:46:00.000Z	lupine_85	harisund	you can give it another IP in the second range if needed
2006-09-27T05:46:00.000Z	harisund	lupine_85	ok ! And hehe .. no I do not intend to break my box .. it is my router here :)
