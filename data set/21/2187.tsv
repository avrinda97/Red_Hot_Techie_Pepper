2010-02-17T09:38:00.000Z	pingun8		Anyone fo good peoples,  could you be so kind to help? in gnome, i need to find how to change a key binding, guys, how to select multiple items in ubuntu, like ctrl in windows? CTRL moves the window right now...
2010-02-17T09:39:00.000Z	torasuku	pingun8	by default ALT should move the window and CTRL should still select multiple things.
2010-02-17T09:39:00.000Z	torasuku	pingun8	But System>Preferences>Keyboard (Shortcuts) _should_ be able to help you out.
2010-02-17T09:39:00.000Z	pingun8	torasuku	for some reason it's different for me. can you help find it in shortcuts? i just don't see it there...
2010-02-17T09:41:00.000Z	torasuku	pingun8	try going to "Keyboard" (not shortcuts) then to "Layouts" and click "Layout Options"
2010-02-17T09:41:00.000Z	torasuku	pingun8	I think Alt/Win behaviour might be what you are looking for, check to see if it's "Default"?
2010-02-17T09:43:00.000Z	pingun8	torasuku	al/win is default..
2010-02-17T09:43:00.000Z	torasuku	pingun8	what does the "Alt" key currently do for you?
2010-02-17T09:43:00.000Z	pingun8	torasuku	in nautilus it does... nothing that i see
2010-02-17T09:44:00.000Z	torasuku	pingun8	it doesn't select multiple objects or move the window?
2010-02-17T09:44:00.000Z	pingun8	torasuku	alf+f opens file...
2010-02-17T09:44:00.000Z	torasuku	pingun8	just holding Alt, I mean.
2010-02-17T09:44:00.000Z	pingun8	torasuku	- no, holding alt is nothing
2010-02-17T09:45:00.000Z	pingun8	torasuku	I need to find where is file selection binding... any idea?
2010-02-17T09:45:00.000Z	torasuku	pingun8	no idea, sorry. What keyboard layout are you using?
2010-02-17T09:46:00.000Z	pingun8	torasuku	"us,ru"...
2010-02-17T09:46:00.000Z	torasuku	pingun8	that might be the "problem" then. Your layout might just map the Alt/Ctrl (and maybe others) differently..
2010-02-17T09:47:00.000Z	torasuku	pingun8	okay...
2010-02-17T09:47:00.000Z	pingun8	torasuku	you did it, thanks a lot. ctrl+alt does it - select multiple items_)) so happy now. though would be better to find where to adjust that.
2010-02-17T09:48:00.000Z	torasuku	pingun8	Yeah, I'm not finding where to change that, though I think I might have seen it somewhere before..
2010-02-17T09:49:00.000Z	pingun8	torasuku	have a good day, bye. Thanks for the help.
