2012-04-26T03:23:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Moon_Doggy	try "Mod1" instead of "Alt"
2012-04-26T03:08:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Moon_Doggy	Not very familiar with xmodmap, but post the config and I'll take a look
2012-04-26T03:11:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Moon_Doggy	Moon_Doggy can you post to pastebin? your copy/paste keeps scrolling away :P
2012-04-26T03:12:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Moon_Doggy	I think you need to add "Remove Lock = Caps_Lock" to the top

2012-04-26T03:14:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Moon_Doggy	you might have better luck in the #xorg channel
2012-04-26T03:16:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Moon_Doggy	did the error message say "alt" or "Alt"?
2012-04-26T03:18:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Moon_Doggy	weird, because you don't have "alt" IN your config...
2012-04-26T03:18:00.000Z	Moon_Doggy	DarwinSurvivor	oh sry i added the comments to the pastebin
2012-04-26T03:19:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Moon_Doggy	oh

2012-04-26T03:44:00.000Z	Moon_Doggy	DarwinSurvivor	ok so capslock is now a "alt" key but i cant use it to alt+tab lol
2012-04-26T03:47:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Moon_Doggy	what *does* the new alt key work for at this point?
2012-04-26T03:49:00.000Z	Moon_Doggy	DarwinSurvivor	it works as alt but cant be used in any key combination
2012-04-26T03:50:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Moon_Doggy	can you pastebin your config again, I think I might have an idea
2012-04-26T03:50:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Moon_Doggy	can you pastebin your new config, I think I might have an idea
2012-04-26T03:52:00.000Z	Moon_Doggy	DarwinSurvivor	   http://pastebin.com/mRmX738X  and it was that to get it to work
2012-04-26T03:58:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Moon_Doggy	try this http://pastebin.com/cD9nyB1R
2012-04-26T04:00:00.000Z	Moon_Doggy	DarwinSurvivor	i get this error  http://pastebin.com/27ZQHeRQ
2012-04-26T04:05:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Moon_Doggy	Hmm, I'm out of ideas then. I highly recommend trying the #xorg channel, those guys could probably write the config from memory
2012-04-26T04:13:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Moon_Doggy	no problem
