2011-06-06T19:19:00.000Z	yeshellothere	ray_	i'm not sure exactly what your problem is
2011-06-06T19:20:00.000Z	yeshellothere	ray_	why would you want an alternative to ssh?
2011-06-06T19:22:00.000Z	yeshellothere	ray_	oh you haven't got an sshd on the machine, and you can't install one because your version is too old?
2011-06-06T19:23:00.000Z	yeshellothere	ray_	you can, but Pici's suggestion is best
2011-06-06T19:24:00.000Z	ray_	yeshellothere	well its someone elses machine. i should better not mess with it...
2011-06-06T19:24:00.000Z	yeshellothere	ray_	what exactly are you trying to do?
2011-06-06T19:25:00.000Z	ray_	yeshellothere	i m trying to install ssh on this guys machine
2011-06-06T19:26:00.000Z	yeshellothere	ray_	why don't you just plug your phone in
2011-06-06T19:26:00.000Z	ray_	yeshellothere	we want a remote control .... for fun
2011-06-06T19:27:00.000Z	yeshellothere	ray_	oh right i see, what are you wanting to remote control?
2011-06-06T19:28:00.000Z	yeshellothere	ray_	well SSH works for that, but you guys should try xbmc
2011-06-06T19:29:00.000Z	yeshellothere	ray_	check the old packages archive, cause ssh is very useful
