2010-01-01T16:38:00.000Z	jeffjeffdejeff		well mr bot, i'm following the guide in the link you sent me and have fallen at the first hurdle.  anyone able to tell me why fdisk -l says Cannot open /dev/sda, Cannot open /dev/sdb?
2010-01-01T16:38:00.000Z	airtonix	jeffjeffdejeff	tried prefixxing the command with sudo ?
2010-01-01T16:39:00.000Z	airtonix	jeffjeffdejeff	also : are you targeting those devices as parameters or just runn disk -l ?
2010-01-01T16:40:00.000Z	airtonix	jeffjeffdejeff	you installed windows after ubuntu ?
2010-01-01T16:42:00.000Z	jeffjeffdejeff	airtonix	long story.  windows was already installed ages ago on one disk.  about a year later i installed ubuntu on another disk and could dual boot.  yesterday i was trying to load new storage controller drivers for xp and somehow it's made grub disappear.
2010-01-01T16:43:00.000Z	airtonix	jeffjeffdejeff	makes sense. windows needs to control the mbr to choose the device and partition it loads from, typical operation for installing *anything* in windows is to nuke everything and reboot
2010-01-01T16:44:00.000Z	airtonix	jeffjeffdejeff	like that pages says you first need to be sure of your installed ubuntu version.
2010-01-01T16:44:00.000Z	airtonix	jeffjeffdejeff	and i assume you are operating on it now with a 9.04 live cd  ?
2010-01-01T16:45:00.000Z	airtonix	jeffjeffdejeff	isn't ibex 8.10?
2010-01-01T16:46:00.000Z	airtonix	jeffjeffdejeff	(re : your current 9.04 installation ) is your  / and your /home on the same partition ?
2010-01-01T16:46:00.000Z	airtonix	jeffjeffdejeff	ok one sec.
2010-01-01T16:47:00.000Z	airtonix	jeffjeffdejeff	what is your first issue with restoring the grub >
2010-01-01T16:50:00.000Z	jeffjeffdejeff	airtonix	well, i followed the guide: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=22435  which didn't work.
2010-01-01T16:50:00.000Z	airtonix	jeffjeffdejeff	it'd be good if you could mention at which point your having problems
2010-01-01T16:52:00.000Z	airtonix	jeffjeffdejeff	that link you gave me doesn't seem related to your situation
2010-01-01T16:53:00.000Z	jeffjeffdejeff	airtonix	sorry, i just pasted the wrong link.
2010-01-01T16:55:00.000Z	jeffjeffdejeff	airtonix	http://pastebin.com/d7583a9a6
2010-01-01T16:58:00.000Z	jeffjeffdejeff	airtonix	i've just downloaded a 9.04 disk - do you think it would make any difference if i booted into that rather than the ibex disk?
2010-01-01T16:58:00.000Z	airtonix	jeffjeffdejeff	im not sure, but it would remove that as one of the factors no doubt.
2010-01-01T17:04:00.000Z	airtonix	jeffjeffdejeff	so it didn't work this time round (i assume you used the last command there on the page you linked me (its not in your pastebin))
2010-01-01T17:13:00.000Z	jeffjeffdejeff	airtonix	hi there. i'm a little unsure actually as to what i should use as the final command - do i do setup (hd1,0) (as per my find command) or do i do just setup (hd1)?
