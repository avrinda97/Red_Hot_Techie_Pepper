2010-03-06T12:02:00.000Z	airtonix	kevbo	also : offtopic (although i realise #windows isn't a support channel compared to this one)
2010-03-06T12:07:00.000Z	airtonix	kevbo	did you see the link i posted ?
2010-03-06T12:07:00.000Z	airtonix	kevbo	so did you download mysgit ?
2010-03-06T12:08:00.000Z	airtonix	kevbo	http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list
2010-03-06T12:08:00.000Z	airtonix	kevbo	you dont 'run' git files
2010-03-06T12:09:00.000Z	airtonix	kevbo	the terminology you want there is that : you access 'git' repositories
2010-03-06T12:10:00.000Z	airtonix	kevbo	i refer you to your intial message : <kevbo> how do I download a git file from the net in windows? apparently I need b43-tools.git before I can get internet working in ubuntu..
2010-03-06T12:11:00.000Z	airtonix	kevbo	to access a 'git' repository in windows you need a 'git' client. http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list << is the easiest method of getting a git client on windows so you can access a git repository and download files from it
2010-03-06T12:13:00.000Z	airtonix	kevbo	maybe you should try going the ndiswrapper first so you have wifi working ?
2010-03-06T12:13:00.000Z	airtonix	kevbo	a game of tetris a day keeps the psychologist away
2010-03-06T12:15:00.000Z	airtonix	kevbo	i have that one too. mine doubles as a bluetooth device too.
2010-03-06T12:15:00.000Z	airtonix	kevbo	the b43 driver didn't work for me though... only ndis wrapper method worked for me.
2010-03-06T12:16:00.000Z	airtonix	kevbo	is it a laptop/netbook or dekstop machine ?
2010-03-06T12:18:00.000Z	airtonix	kevbo	you should head over to the laptop manufacturers website and grab the windows drivers for the wifi card then.
2010-03-06T12:19:00.000Z	airtonix	kevbo	but back to your initial question... have you actually done the git clone step of that page you linked to me ?
2010-03-06T12:21:00.000Z	airtonix	kevbo	and i assumed (since you mentioned doing this step in windows) that you have access to a machine which has internet access
2010-03-06T12:23:00.000Z	airtonix	kevbo	so back to my initial repsonse : download and install msysgit on your windows machine that has internet access... then do the "git clone " stage on the page you linked to me on the windows machine...
2010-03-06T12:25:00.000Z	kevbo	airtonix	I didn't know much about git "repositories" at the time :p I'll give it a shot
