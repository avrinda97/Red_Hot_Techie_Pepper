2008-08-22T06:58:00.000Z	m1r		how to corectly set home/user/public_html symlink into var/www ?
2008-08-22T06:58:00.000Z	cskmax	m1r	move the files to /var/www?
2008-08-22T06:59:00.000Z	cskmax		wdc: odd, that doesn't happen to me. could not say :(
2008-08-22T06:59:00.000Z	cskmax		wdc: gtkpod has automagically recognized my ipod on a clean hardy install
2008-08-22T06:59:00.000Z	m1r	cskmax	why move files if i want symlink ?
2008-08-22T07:00:00.000Z	cskmax	m1r	  'sudo ln -s [target] [link]'
2008-08-22T07:00:00.000Z	cskmax		wdc: probably not over that ;)    i'd google the error and go from there, i have no experience with that issue
2008-08-22T07:00:00.000Z	m1r	cskmax	ln -s /home/user/public_html /var/www ?
2008-08-22T07:00:00.000Z	cskmax	m1r	probably use /var/www/public_html as the link name
2008-08-22T07:01:00.000Z	m1r	cskmax	i want evade /var/www/public_html, but want just to have all files from public_html in /var/www
2008-08-22T07:01:00.000Z	cskmax	m1r	you can't make a symlink if a directory already exists with that name; and what you are describing is not really good practice for Apache
2008-08-22T07:02:00.000Z	cskmax	m1r	for clarity you should have things under /var/www
2008-08-22T07:02:00.000Z	cskmax	m1r	may i kindly suggest joining #apache for specific recommendations for your case
2008-08-22T07:03:00.000Z	m1r	cskmax	apache have nothing to do with simple symlink, problem is ubuntu creates /var/www/public_html when symlinked which i want evade and have public_html files directly in www root
2008-08-22T07:05:00.000Z	cskmax	m1r	it's a little old but maybe http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=143350 has relevant info
2008-08-22T07:05:00.000Z	cskmax		good luck
2008-08-22T07:06:00.000Z	m1r	cskmax	i check it, tnx
2008-08-22T07:06:00.000Z	cskmax		you are concerned with the 'userdir' module's functionality, it's really not specific to ubuntu ;)
2008-08-22T07:06:00.000Z	cskmax		yw
2008-08-22T07:07:00.000Z	m1r	cskmax	no, i dont want user dir or anything, just simple symlink like i used to do b4 and everything worked fine :/ now when i make symlink, it adds public_html in www root which i dont want or need.
2008-08-22T07:15:00.000Z	m1r	cskmax	ok, i tried with public_html and www , both give same result when symlinked to /var/www/www or public_html, i just cant get files to show under www root from any of those two folders
