2011-03-17T10:53:00.000Z	HyperHoRse		hi, what version of ubuntu is the best version
2011-03-17T10:54:00.000Z	HyperHoRse		what version does mark shuttworth use on his personal
2011-03-17T10:54:00.000Z	HyperHoRse		I have 10.10
2011-03-17T10:54:00.000Z	HyperHoRse		What is better in 11.04?
2011-03-17T10:54:00.000Z	HyperHoRse		thor: what is 12:12
2011-03-17T10:54:00.000Z	iceroot	HyperHoRse	its not a stable release yet so forget about 11.04
2011-03-17T10:55:00.000Z	HyperHoRse	iceroot	But what is better and more improved?
2011-03-17T10:55:00.000Z	iceroot	HyperHoRse	11.04 is using a very important kernel-patch which should bring better desktop performance
2011-03-17T10:56:00.000Z	HyperHoRse	iceroot	I have only 512mb of ram
2011-03-17T10:56:00.000Z	HyperHoRse	iceroot	Will the latest ubuntu always run with my low amount of memory.
2011-03-17T10:56:00.000Z	iceroot	HyperHoRse	i think with 512mb ram, lubuntu is worth  look
2011-03-17T10:56:00.000Z	iceroot	HyperHoRse	not very good
2011-03-17T10:56:00.000Z	HyperHoRse	iceroot	I also have a 512mb graphics card
2011-03-17T10:56:00.000Z	iceroot	HyperHoRse	not if you are using ubuntu (with gnome)
2011-03-17T10:56:00.000Z	HyperHoRse	iceroot	Yeah but my 512mb geforce takes care of opengl
2011-03-17T10:57:00.000Z	iceroot	HyperHoRse	doesnt matter, applications are not using the ram of your vga
2011-03-17T10:57:00.000Z	HyperHoRse	iceroot	is that actually true because I thought opengl takes care of all that
2011-03-17T10:57:00.000Z	iceroot	HyperHoRse	its as i said
2011-03-17T10:58:00.000Z	HyperHoRse	iceroot	Will ubuntu always support 512mb of ram
2011-03-17T10:59:00.000Z	iceroot	HyperHoRse	its not a question of support, its a question about performance
2011-03-17T10:59:00.000Z	HyperHoRse	iceroot	more like a support question
