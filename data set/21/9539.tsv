2006-08-19T12:41:00.000Z	auTONYmous		anybody here have a Intel wireless card?
2006-08-19T12:42:00.000Z	auTONYmous		are you using wep, shared key, 128bit
2006-08-19T12:42:00.000Z	auTONYmous		dammit
2006-08-19T12:43:00.000Z	auTONYmous		I'm trying to use my connection at work: 128-bit WEB, hidden SSID, shared key in hex...can't get the damn thing to work at all
2006-08-19T12:43:00.000Z	auTONYmous		I haven't gone as far as recompiling new drivers yet
2006-08-19T12:43:00.000Z	fangorious	auTONYmous	you using Network Manager?
2006-08-19T12:45:00.000Z	fangorious	auTONYmous	you can hand edit /etc/network/interfaces to hard code your wep settings
2006-08-19T12:46:00.000Z	auTONYmous	fangorious	what if I have two diff networks? (One home, one work)
2006-08-19T12:46:00.000Z	fangorious	auTONYmous	some people smarter than me have figured out how to do multiple networks with the interfaces file, but I just use NetworkManager
2006-08-19T12:47:00.000Z	auTONYmous	fangorious	I haven't tried my home net yet, since it's not encrypted, but the one here at work is givin me the blues
2006-08-19T12:48:00.000Z	fangorious	auTONYmous	are you typing in the hex key, and ascii key, or a passprhase?
2006-08-19T12:48:00.000Z	auTONYmous	fangorious	hex key. It's what was shared.
2006-08-19T12:49:00.000Z	auTONYmous	fangorious	works on windblows...
2006-08-19T12:49:00.000Z	fangorious	auTONYmous	have you tried typing it in with  and without '0x' in front of it?
2006-08-19T12:49:00.000Z	auTONYmous	fangorious	I'll try that
2006-08-19T12:52:00.000Z	auTONYmous	fangorious	the key length is incorrect with the 0x in front.
2006-08-19T12:53:00.000Z	fangorious	auTONYmous	it's been so long since i used WEP, having trouble remembering
2006-08-19T12:53:00.000Z	auTONYmous	fangorious	I ASKED why they weren't using WPA...couldn't get a straight answer
2006-08-19T12:54:00.000Z	fangorious	auTONYmous	did you ask what the passprhase used to generate the key was? might have better luck with that
2006-08-19T12:55:00.000Z	auTONYmous	fangorious	it's Saturday...I'm here all by myself, and besides...the network team Nazis wouldn't tell me anyway if I DID ask.
2006-08-19T12:55:00.000Z	fangorious	auTONYmous	that's crazy, you already have the key, all you're going to do with the passphrase is generate the key!
