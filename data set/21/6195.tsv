2007-05-13T10:48:00.000Z	Jul1609		hem...I get a lot of characters, but nothing humanly intelligible :s
2007-05-13T10:49:00.000Z	Jul1609		ok, just tell, me do you guys think I did right to upgrade from an Nvidia Quad to an ATI Radeon 9200?
2007-05-13T10:49:00.000Z	Jul1609		or even to switch from NVidia to ATI (I though about it too...)
2007-05-13T10:50:00.000Z	Jul1609		Super_cat_Frog: So do you think I should put the Quad card where it was?
2007-05-13T10:51:00.000Z	Jul1609		ok, well, let me confirm: so far, ATI sucks
2007-05-13T10:52:00.000Z	gordboy	Jul1609	ati radeon 9200se rocks
2007-05-13T10:53:00.000Z	Jul1609	gordboy	that's what I have, but it's slow I can't watch videos on that piece of sh** I call my com
2007-05-13T10:53:00.000Z	gordboy	Jul1609	i use the xorg radeon driver. and it really works well
2007-05-13T10:54:00.000Z	gordboy	Jul1609	more than adequate
2007-05-13T10:54:00.000Z	Jul1609	gordboy	xorg radeon driver? where do you get that?
2007-05-13T10:55:00.000Z	gordboy	Jul1609	it's installed automatically. just change/create your /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-05-13T10:56:00.000Z	Jul1609	gordboy	I've already seen that one, alright. But I don't know that file, what should I change and for what?
2007-05-13T10:57:00.000Z	Jul1609	gordboy	do you know any website where I can learn about all these system files on Ubuntu? see, having a solution is cool, but I would love to understand these solution ;)
2007-05-13T10:58:00.000Z	gordboy	Jul1609	my xorg.conf, edit to taste - http://rafb.net/p/GyMt9n98.html
2007-05-13T10:59:00.000Z	Jul1609	gordboy	thak you, I'll study that, brb
2007-05-13T11:07:00.000Z	Jul1609	gordboy	I edited the /etc/X11/xorg.conf to copy paste the section "device", but then when I rebooted, X crashed. Guess that's what backups are all about :p
2007-05-13T11:09:00.000Z	Jul1609	gordboy	should I paste my xorg.conf file somewhere you can see, maybe somethings wrong?
2007-05-13T11:14:00.000Z	gordboy	Jul1609	sure paste it
2007-05-13T11:14:00.000Z	Jul1609	gordboy	I don't have it in my xorg.conf
2007-05-13T11:14:00.000Z	gordboy	Jul1609	that's for nvidia cards
