2005-12-30T07:12:00.000Z	glick		it doesnt seem to be trying to connect to anything
2005-12-30T07:12:00.000Z	linkd	glick	u behind a router or firewall?
2005-12-30T07:12:00.000Z	glick	linkd	yes
2005-12-30T07:13:00.000Z	linkd	glick	hmm, im reading the gtk-gnutella FAQ and it says you dont *need* ports forwarding but it works better if u do
2005-12-30T07:14:00.000Z	glick	linkd	right
2005-12-30T07:14:00.000Z	glick	linkd	yeah i read that too

2005-12-30T07:16:00.000Z	linkd	glick	hmm those messages are what i get when i run it, except it works fine for me
2005-12-30T07:16:00.000Z	linkd	glick	it does suggest upgrading to the latest version tho
2005-12-30T07:21:00.000Z	linkd	glick	heh, that could indeed be a good reason
2005-12-30T07:21:00.000Z	linkd	glick	hmm im not sure, ud have to look thru the ubuntu webby for contact details of someone i think.
2005-12-30T07:23:00.000Z	linkd	glick	there is actually .deb packages on the sf.net download page. i assume these are debian, not ubuntu, packages, but i like to live dangerously and it doesnt ussual do any harm :P
2005-12-30T07:36:00.000Z	linkd	glick	he was working about the debian packages the gtk-gnutella team offer on sourceforge
2005-12-30T07:44:00.000Z	linkd	glick	did it look as good as the previous version? or does it look like the old gtk?
2005-12-30T07:44:00.000Z	glick	linkd	it looks the same except it works well
