2008-08-07T16:17:00.000Z	onikos	cherva	Yes, maybe. We could try doing something to fix if you have broken packages
2008-08-07T16:18:00.000Z	onikos	cherva	It's maybe "sudo shutdown 0" it will not shutdown the computer but go to maintenance mode.
2008-08-07T16:18:00.000Z	cherva	onikos	this is the broken package I need to fix inorder to install libmjpegtools0c2a
2008-08-07T16:18:00.000Z	onikos	cherva	and one of the maintenances is to fix broken packages.
2008-08-07T16:19:00.000Z	onikos	cherva	You won't lose anything by trying, but first save all your unsaved works.
2008-08-07T16:19:00.000Z	onikos	cherva	Have you tried "shutdown 0" means it will go to maintenace mode in 0 minutes.
2008-08-07T16:20:00.000Z	onikos	cherva	right.
2008-08-07T16:20:00.000Z	onikos	cherva	Please come back even if it works

2008-08-07T16:23:00.000Z	onikos	cherva	Did it not work even under maintenance?
2008-08-07T16:27:00.000Z	cherva	onikos	it just says "unmet dependencies" and when it tries to fix them it installs libquicktime1 and the same error comes
2008-08-07T16:27:00.000Z	onikos	cherva	Oh...
2008-08-07T16:28:00.000Z	cherva	onikos	libquicktime1 is broken
2008-08-07T16:28:00.000Z	onikos	cherva	is the ï»¿libquicktime1 package installed right now in a broken state?
2008-08-07T16:29:00.000Z	cherva	onikos	no libmjpegtools0c2a is in a broken state because it requires libquicktime1 witch is uninstallable from the repos
2008-08-07T16:34:00.000Z	cherva	onikos	sudo apt-get -f install  http://pastebin.com/d4ba35b3e
