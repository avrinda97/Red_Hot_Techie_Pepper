2008-10-20T06:50:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	zeelot	can you pastebin any error msgs you are getting?
2008-10-20T06:51:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	zeelot	maybe try this: dpkg -l | grep ^ii               I think thats it

2008-10-20T06:57:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	zeelot	so, its mysql thats causing the problem
2008-10-20T06:57:00.000Z	zeelot	danbh_intrepid	how do I solve it? my mysql server seems to be running fine though...
2008-10-20T06:59:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	zeelot	maybe remove mysql, and try to reinstall?  I dunno..
2008-10-20T06:59:00.000Z	zeelot	danbh_intrepid	how do I remove it? I can't use dpkg for anything
2008-10-20T07:00:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	zeelot	sudo dpkg --force-depends --purge (or --remove) mysql-server-5.0
2008-10-20T07:07:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	zeelot	have you gotten things working?
2008-10-20T07:08:00.000Z	zeelot	danbh_intrepid	yea seems fine thanks a lot
2008-10-20T07:09:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	zeelot	did you just reinstall mysql?
2008-10-20T07:12:00.000Z	zeelot	danbh_intrepid	yea seemed to do the trick
