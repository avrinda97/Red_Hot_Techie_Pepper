2008-11-07T08:18:00.000Z	squarebracket		is there a seperate trash for root? i just deleted 12.1 gigs under a sudo'd nautilus and it didn't free up 12.1 gigs
2008-11-07T08:18:00.000Z	karsten	squarebracket	No.
2008-11-07T08:18:00.000Z	karsten	squarebracket	erm.  O dear.  Don't do that.
2008-11-07T08:18:00.000Z	karsten	squarebracket	drop to a terminal.  'df -h' should show free space / utilization by partition.
2008-11-07T08:21:00.000Z	squarebracket	karsten	i just did bad things, didn't i...
2008-11-07T08:21:00.000Z	karsten	squarebracket	Running GUI file management tools as root is ... frowned on.
2008-11-07T08:21:00.000Z	squarebracket	karsten	same thing. i guess being too lazy to rm -r the folders screwed me over?
2008-11-07T08:22:00.000Z	karsten	squarebracket	'df' and 'du' can trace down where the space is.  If you deleted files which are open by other tools, then they may still exist.  Or nautilus may have tried to help you by saving stuff in trash.  Yeah, you probably want to find out  where root's trash is.
2008-11-07T08:22:00.000Z	karsten	squarebracket	I don't use nautilus period so I don't know off the top of my head.
2008-11-07T08:24:00.000Z	squarebracket	karsten	duly noted. what do you use? =]
2008-11-07T08:27:00.000Z	karsten	squarebracket	bash ;-)
2008-11-07T08:27:00.000Z	karsten	squarebracket	If I want some sort of interactive tool for file management, 'mc', based on an old Norton utility.
2008-11-07T08:27:00.000Z	squarebracket	karsten	lol. my command-fu isn't good enough to do things like matching pattern deletes =)
2008-11-07T08:33:00.000Z	karsten	squarebracket	find . -name \*pattern\*
2008-11-07T08:33:00.000Z	squarebracket	karsten	| xargs rm ?
2008-11-07T08:33:00.000Z	karsten	squarebracket	... is a good start.  You can slice and dice it a bit from there.  If you're not sure you want to delete that automatically (you could do ... yeah, xargs), you can write to a file.
2008-11-07T08:34:00.000Z	karsten	squarebracket	... then edit the file manually, and feed *that* to xargs.
2008-11-07T08:34:00.000Z	karsten	squarebracket	xargs rm <file
2008-11-07T08:35:00.000Z	squarebracket	karsten	bash is so cool. i keep on meaning to learn it better.
2008-11-07T08:35:00.000Z	karsten	squarebracket	Use it.  Buy "UNIX Power Tools"
2008-11-07T08:37:00.000Z	squarebracket	karsten	ya? i started reading the guide in #bash's topic... but i've heard unix power tools is good.
