2006-07-03T09:15:00.000Z	Warbo	spatieman	Whathappens when you try to boot?
2006-07-03T09:26:00.000Z	Warbo	spatieman	Surely the bector is where GRUB is, not Ubuntu?
2006-07-03T09:27:00.000Z	Warbo	spatieman	sudo apt-get install lilo ?
2006-07-03T09:38:00.000Z	Warbo	spatieman	Use the LiveCD, mount your HD install then use chroot to access it (and bind /dev to the /dev of your system)
2006-07-03T09:40:00.000Z	Warbo	spatieman	If you want lilo boot into a LiveCD (and talk to me, not rtux :))
2006-07-03T09:41:00.000Z	spatieman	Warbo	sorry, i thought he was from the helpdesk
2006-07-03T09:41:00.000Z	Warbo	spatieman	You can boot into a LiveCD then mount your ubuntu system
2006-07-03T09:41:00.000Z	Warbo	spatieman	That lets you access it without booting it, so you can install lilo
2006-07-03T09:42:00.000Z	spatieman	Warbo	me n00b, how to mount ?
2006-07-03T09:42:00.000Z	Warbo	spatieman	"sudo mount /dev/<whatever your partition is> /mnt"
2006-07-03T09:47:00.000Z	Warbo	spatieman	Are you in a LiveCD with your system mounted at all?
2006-07-03T09:48:00.000Z	spatieman	Warbo	I was..
2006-07-03T09:48:00.000Z	Warbo	spatieman	Just wondering if you still wanted some help
2006-07-03T09:48:00.000Z	Warbo	spatieman	OK, so do you have your Ubuntu partition mounted on /mnt?
2006-07-03T09:50:00.000Z	Warbo	spatieman	So it is mounted somewhere? (/mnt?)
2006-07-03T09:52:00.000Z	Warbo	spatieman	If you do "sudo mount --bind /dev /<wherver ubuntu is mounted>/dev" then "sudo chroot /<wherever ubuntu is mounted>" then you can install lilo
2006-07-03T09:59:00.000Z	spatieman	Warbo	i have mounted the correct partition in the liveCD ,i did a cd /mnt ,do i now install the lilo package in it
2006-07-03T10:00:00.000Z	Warbo	spatieman	You need to do "chroot /mnt" (after binding /dev to /mnt/dev with "sudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev")
2006-07-03T10:01:00.000Z	Warbo	spatieman	Then you need a package of Lilo, copy it into /mnt and install it with "dpkg -i lilo*deb" (no sudo needed)
2006-07-03T10:31:00.000Z	spatieman	Warbo	I do a reboot, and login to irc with the liveCD ,i seems that i do something wrong
