2008-10-27T04:20:00.000Z	ubuntu4me		Greetings.  Is ubuntu (livecd) able to boot the underlying OS, via some VM software?  The wife still need WinXX for iTunes..
2008-10-27T04:21:00.000Z	kerin	ubuntu4me	you'd be better off running Frostwire in linux
2008-10-27T04:21:00.000Z	ubuntu4me	kerin	 thanks
2008-10-27T04:21:00.000Z	ubuntu4me	kerin	 let me google
2008-10-27T04:21:00.000Z	kerin	ubuntu4me	agh!  wait.
2008-10-27T04:21:00.000Z	ubuntu4me		?
2008-10-27T04:22:00.000Z	kerin	ubuntu4me	my bad, i'm an idiot.  thought you said winMX, which is a filesharing client.
2008-10-27T04:22:00.000Z	kerin	ubuntu4me	does she need itunes for the itunes store or ipod sync?
2008-10-27T04:22:00.000Z	ubuntu4me	kerin	 itunes store..
2008-10-27T04:23:00.000Z	ubuntu4me	kerin	 Starbucks give out free music weekly w/ her coffee..  :(
2008-10-27T04:23:00.000Z	kerin	ubuntu4me	ah.  well, you could run windows through a VM inside ubuntu but you can't just boot the windows on your hard drive inside linux.
2008-10-27T04:23:00.000Z	kerin	ubuntu4me	i've heard itunes works in Wine, but as far as I can tell that's a filthy lie.
2008-10-27T04:24:00.000Z	ubuntu4me	kerin	 Sure you can... w/ VMWare, but it's not on the ubuntu livecd.
2008-10-27T04:24:00.000Z	ubuntu4me	kerin	 ok..  sounds like I'm SOL w/ the livecd then?
2008-10-27T04:24:00.000Z	kerin	ubuntu4me	if you tried that with VMware, i'm pretty sure there would be configuration issues from booting into virtualized/different hardware.  for instance?  activation.
2008-10-27T04:25:00.000Z	kerin	ubuntu4me	 kind of.  how adventurous are you feeling?
2008-10-27T04:25:00.000Z	ubuntu4me	kerin	 I don't want to hack VMWare, via a nfs share or anything like that, if that's what you're asking.  Too much *nix at work.  I just want it to work.
2008-10-27T04:25:00.000Z	kerin	ubuntu4me	because if you had a flash drive, you could make an ubuntu live-USB stick with data persistence.  which'd let you install software, etc
2008-10-27T04:27:00.000Z	ubuntu4me	kerin	 ok, thanks for the sugguestions.  Would be a cool project if I had time..
2008-10-27T04:27:00.000Z	kerin	ubuntu4me	i'm still not convinced that you can actually, you know, VMware the windows partition without the guest OS flipping out and going "whoa, all my hardware is different."  same reason you can't just pop a hard drive with XP into a different machine and expect it to boot.
2008-10-27T04:27:00.000Z	kerin	ubuntu4me	 it shouldn't be terribly time consuming.  if you google for ubuntu liveusb utility you should find a slick GUI tool to do all the heavy lifting for you.
