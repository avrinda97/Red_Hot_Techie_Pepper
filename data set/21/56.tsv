2012-11-11T06:45:00.000Z	escott	dougbb	its not a regular disk. its a ptp device you can fuse mount it
2012-11-11T06:45:00.000Z	escott	dougbb	or mtp rather
2012-11-11T06:47:00.000Z	escott	dougbb	its obnoxious. a little additional circuitry and they could enable gadget mode in the kernel and export usb mass storage from an ext3 filesystem
2012-11-11T06:47:00.000Z	dougbb	escott	right .... I have an LG android phone that lets me mount both the system disk and the sd card
2012-11-11T06:48:00.000Z	dougbb	escott	do you happen to know if the nexus 7 has the same problem?
2012-11-11T06:48:00.000Z	escott	dougbb	its one of the main reasons im not upgrading to ICS
2012-11-11T08:40:00.000Z	escott	dougbb	if you assume that there isn't any point in securing anything
2012-11-11T08:41:00.000Z	dougbb	escott	sure there is ... the goal is to make your system harder to crack than average, so that they spend time elsewhere :)
2012-11-11T08:42:00.000Z	escott	dougbb	which contradicts your assumption. if they have infinite resources they attack all computers at the same time
2012-11-11T08:43:00.000Z	dougbb	escott	you can choose to go reductio ad absurdum if you want, that doesn't make my point any less valid
2012-11-11T08:46:00.000Z	escott	dougbb	the style of the statement is in the style of the statements that are common in the cryptography community. but its a ridiculous thing to say in that community (assume the attacker can perform X flops, or that the attacker can factor primes in X time etc). you clearly mean it in some other sense... not sure what sense that is or what you want it to mean.
2012-11-11T09:23:00.000Z	escott	dougbb	jockey is not present in yokobr's release. it was removed in 12.10 and up
2012-11-11T09:23:00.000Z	dougbb	escott	I have 12.10 :)
2012-11-11T09:24:00.000Z	escott	dougbb	but its not part of the standard install. i think you get it if you had it earlier, but they are moving away from it
2012-11-11T09:24:00.000Z	dougbb	escott	well this was a clean install
2012-11-11T09:26:00.000Z	escott	dougbb	https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/quantal/i386/jockey-gtk
2012-11-11T09:26:00.000Z	dougbb	escott	I already have it, but thanks :)
2012-11-11T09:28:00.000Z	escott	dougbb	i'm saying look at that link. also run "dpkg -L jockey-gtk" you will see no binary in the output. there is no jockey-gtk for a 12.10 user to run
2012-11-11T09:31:00.000Z	dougbb	escott	got it :)
2012-11-11T09:32:00.000Z	escott	dougbb	canonical does a terrible job of announcing these kinds of changes... it kinda drives me crazy
2012-11-11T10:00:00.000Z	dougbb	escott	right
