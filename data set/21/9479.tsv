2007-03-30T16:51:00.000Z	Flannel	dingdong	can't read that file, eh?  What are the perms on /etc/networking/interfaces?
2007-03-30T16:51:00.000Z	Flannel	dingdong	ls -al /etc/networking
2007-03-30T16:51:00.000Z	Flannel	dingdong	er, /etc/network
2007-03-30T16:52:00.000Z	Flannel	dingdong	we're wondering about the rwx etc etc bit
2007-03-30T16:53:00.000Z	Flannel	dingdong	the interfaces one
2007-03-30T16:53:00.000Z	Flannel	dingdong	the whole interfaces line will work
2007-03-30T16:53:00.000Z	Flannel	dingdong	two of them?  pastebin the outputof that command
2007-03-30T16:54:00.000Z	Flannel	dingdong	ah.  right.  the interfaces one is the one we're interested in
2007-03-30T16:54:00.000Z	Flannel	dingdong	I believe the ~ is a backup.
2007-03-30T16:56:00.000Z	Flannel	dingdong	right right.   Well, that looks normal.  No idea why it wouldn't be able to read that file.  You could try replacing it with the backup (the ~ one) see if that helps
2007-03-30T16:57:00.000Z	Flannel	dingdong	you have an interfaces and an interfaces~
