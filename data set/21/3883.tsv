2008-10-29T22:25:00.000Z	jspiro	Dryanta	what version of Ubuntu are you using?
2008-10-29T22:26:00.000Z	jspiro	Dryanta	could you please check for me the versions listed at http://packages.ubuntu.com/xtightvnc
2008-10-29T22:27:00.000Z	Dryanta	jspiro	1.2.9-22
2008-10-29T22:29:00.000Z	jspiro	Dryanta	Google says: No results found for "vnc server supports 4.0 (client 3.3)". Odd. Try RealVNC instead
2008-10-29T22:34:00.000Z	Dryanta	jspiro	realvnc doesnt show up on synaptic?
2008-10-29T22:34:00.000Z	jspiro	Dryanta	please hold, i will investigate
2008-10-29T22:36:00.000Z	jspiro	Dryanta	try any of the clients listed at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNC#VNC%20Clients.  do they work?
2008-10-29T22:38:00.000Z	Dryanta	jspiro	vinagre no worky
2008-10-29T22:38:00.000Z	jspiro	Dryanta	what error?
2008-10-29T22:40:00.000Z	jspiro	Dryanta	dunno what to say
2008-10-29T22:41:00.000Z	jspiro	Dryanta	keep trying different clients.  Or different servers.
2008-10-29T22:41:00.000Z	jspiro	Dryanta	 I recommend you use vino and rdesktop.  They work well together.
2008-10-29T22:42:00.000Z	Dryanta	jspiro	vino is a server
2008-10-29T22:42:00.000Z	jspiro	Dryanta	where is the server?
