2006-09-04T14:00:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy		Not to mention they dont need to BUY anything :-)
2006-09-04T14:01:00.000Z	ardchoille	Crippy-Boy	What makes you think there isn't a ton of GPL'd code in Window's code base now?
2006-09-04T14:01:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy	ardchoille	The fact that itd be illegal, and however stupid ms are i dont think theyd risk that kinda thing, And the win 2k code leak that turned up no gpl'd code
2006-09-04T14:02:00.000Z	ardchoille	Crippy-Boy	It would surprise me.. seeing as how they steal from everyone else
2007-04-10T12:13:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy	ardchoille	Thanks for that, i don't use xmms, so i was just assuming :-)
2007-04-10T12:14:00.000Z	ardchoille	Crippy-Boy	You're welcome :)
2007-04-10T12:16:00.000Z	ardchoille	Crippy-Boy	I agree, but you can write a "master script" to do installs and tweaks after a new install. I have a master script that sets everything up, does tweaks, installs, themes, etc so I install Ubuntu, run the master script, go have lunch and when I get back the system is ready for me to play :)
