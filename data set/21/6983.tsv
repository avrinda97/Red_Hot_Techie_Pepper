2008-04-27T21:26:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	conan	run sudo nvidia-settings
2008-04-27T21:28:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	conan	open synaptic.. system/admin/synaptic
2008-04-27T21:28:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	conan	ok
2008-04-27T21:30:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	conan	no prob, just remember, you'll need to run nvidia-settings as root if you want to save anyc hanges to xorg configuration..(ie, gksudo nvidia-settings)

2008-04-27T21:43:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	conan	set up dual screens several times, and never saw that error.. are they both running on one video card, or two separate ones, or whst
2008-04-27T21:45:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	conan	where are you setting the resolutions?.. set them in nvidia-settings...
2008-04-27T21:46:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	conan	a twin screen?
2008-04-27T21:47:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	conan	oh ok.. i did that a long time ago, but honestly, can't remember how.
2008-04-27T21:49:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	conan	do you want them as separate displays, or 1 big display?
2008-04-27T21:50:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	conan	i know that.., but do you want 1 desktop, to stretch across both monitors, or 1 desktop on each monitor
2008-04-27T21:51:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	conan	ok.
2008-04-27T22:02:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	conan	if you have them set up as separate displays, you can't
2008-04-27T22:03:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	conan	then you would open the movies on the hdtv ...
