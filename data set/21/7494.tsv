2007-12-04T02:56:00.000Z	emma		Im currently using feisty what is the consensus on whether it is a good idea to upgrade?
2007-12-04T02:57:00.000Z	emma		Is it a good idea to upgrade to gutsy or should a person wait?
2007-12-04T02:58:00.000Z	emma		How can I tell if I have an ATi card?
2007-12-04T02:59:00.000Z	emma		how do I post the lspci?
2007-12-04T03:00:00.000Z	FluxD	emma	terminal type in lspci then pastebin.ca
2007-12-04T03:07:00.000Z	FluxD	emma	are u using two music players or a video player and xmms ?
2007-12-04T03:07:00.000Z	FluxD	emma	that is why :) u can only play 1 ata time
2007-12-04T03:08:00.000Z	FluxD	emma	just reinstall totem or play using VLC
2007-12-04T03:08:00.000Z	FluxD	emma	well reinstall could fix usually all errors, its not a bad thing
2007-12-04T03:09:00.000Z	FluxD	emma	try opening totem thru terminal
2007-12-04T03:09:00.000Z	emma	FluxD	 okay I'll try that.
2007-12-04T03:12:00.000Z	emma	FluxD	 when I try to start totem (even from the terminal) the window comes up but it keeps on waiting.. as if it were going to load.. but it never does.. when I click to close the window it says, "Totem  Move Player" is not responding... "
2007-12-04T03:12:00.000Z	FluxD	emma	look in terminal for any errors
2007-12-04T03:15:00.000Z	FluxD	emma	any reason u need to use only totem? If u cannot find a reason just reinstall or use any other player like vlc or mplayer
2007-12-04T03:17:00.000Z	FluxD	emma	thats not a soundcad problem xmms and the other player just cannot be used at the same time
2007-12-04T03:18:00.000Z	FluxD	emma	audio for?
2007-12-04T03:18:00.000Z	FluxD	emma	u cant use 2 apps that use sound together
2007-12-04T03:35:00.000Z	FluxD	emma	not a good thing to do
2007-12-04T03:35:00.000Z	FluxD	emma	just restart and see
