2005-12-10T17:46:00.000Z	macd		I think the ubuntu desktop has under the system menu --> administration -->systemmonitor
2005-12-10T06:15:00.000Z	soundray	macd	depending on one's priorities, Linux compatibility could be reason enough...
2005-12-10T06:15:00.000Z	macd	soundray	then one should have 2 machines and use samba
2005-12-10T06:16:00.000Z	soundray	macd	I for one am much happier with FAT32 because I only ever use Windows if I get an attachment that I can't refuse and that Openoffice chokes on.
2005-12-10T06:17:00.000Z	macd	soundray	good enough reason for you then I guess ;)
2005-12-10T06:18:00.000Z	soundray	macd	also in my experience, if a FAT32 system does have a problem, it's easier to fix than if an NTFS one does.
2008-05-04T04:31:00.000Z	soundray	macd	doubt or disk?
2008-05-04T05:16:00.000Z	soundray	macd	could you have a quick look at jc's problem, please: http://paste.ubuntu.com/9877/
2008-05-04T05:17:00.000Z	macd	soundray	I think he needs to rm -rf /var/cache/apt/archives/*
2008-05-04T05:18:00.000Z	soundray	macd	thanks
2008-05-04T05:18:00.000Z	macd	soundray	then he'll have to recreate it, like gleyve  ;)
2008-05-04T05:21:00.000Z	macd	soundray	gleyve, yeah I typod earlier it should have been rm partials/* then rm archives/*
2008-05-04T05:21:00.000Z	soundray	macd	is that on the assumption that some cached packages are faulty?
2008-05-04T05:22:00.000Z	macd	soundray	yeah, then apt-get update, then isntall -f should fix
2008-05-04T05:23:00.000Z	macd	soundray	hey you can also update -f to rebuild the package lists locally
2008-05-04T05:23:00.000Z	soundray	macd	you mean instead of switching mirrors?
2008-05-04T05:24:00.000Z	macd	soundray	Id try swapping mirrors next
2008-05-04T05:25:00.000Z	macd	soundray	does your person want all of OOo or just core?
2008-05-04T05:26:00.000Z	soundray	macd	I don't think he needs any of it, strictly. Just stuck in this situation after upgrading...
2008-05-04T05:26:00.000Z	macd	soundray	ahhh, gotcha
2008-07-22T06:10:00.000Z	macd	soundray	dont forget the curl+netcat warriors ;P
