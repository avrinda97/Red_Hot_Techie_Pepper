2008-04-10T03:08:00.000Z	millertime_018		hey i'm having a problem making an iso of the disc that's in my drive
2008-04-10T03:08:00.000Z	millertime_018		HELP PLEASE
2008-04-10T03:08:00.000Z	Dr_willis	millertime_018	 and how are you making it? and what is the disk?
2008-04-10T03:11:00.000Z	Dr_willis	millertime_018	 dd if=/dev/cdrom of=cdrom.iso  perhaps?
2008-04-10T03:11:00.000Z	Dr_willis	millertime_018	 how are you trying to make it anyway?
2008-04-10T03:13:00.000Z	Dr_willis	millertime_018	 cd? dvd? Video? PS2 game? ect.....? that dd command i gave can make a image of normal disks.
2008-04-10T03:13:00.000Z	Dr_willis	millertime_018	 dd of=/dev/dvd of=DVD.iso
2008-04-10T03:14:00.000Z	Dr_willis	millertime_018	 oops typo....
2008-04-10T03:14:00.000Z	Dr_willis	millertime_018	 dd if=/dev/dvd of=DVD.iso
2008-04-10T03:14:00.000Z	Dr_willis	millertime_018	 if= the INPUT FILE, of= the Output file.
2008-04-10T03:14:00.000Z	Dr_willis	millertime_018	 one is what you ar reading from.. other is what you are writing to...
2008-04-10T03:17:00.000Z	Dr_willis	millertime_018	 thats not exactly what you asked how to do.. :)   copy the folder Vista to the HD. and use a tool like k3b or gcombust or other cd burnign tool to make a iso image file with the contents of the directory
2008-11-18T08:03:00.000Z	Dr_willis	millertime_018	 then you must  somehow make a proper fstab entry for the device
2008-11-18T08:04:00.000Z	Dr_willis	millertime_018	 do whatever you want.. the proper way is to make a fstab entry.
2008-11-18T08:06:00.000Z	Dr_willis	millertime_018	 not told him how to do much yet.  .. just what needs to be done..  fstab file is documented in several dozen  places/wikipages/guides/tips/tutorials... also it will depend on the filesystem used
2008-11-18T08:08:00.000Z	Dr_willis	millertime_018	 thats documented all over also.. but one easy way - is to install/run the 'ntfs-config' utility...
2008-11-18T08:11:00.000Z	Dr_willis	millertime_018	 yes.
2008-11-18T08:11:00.000Z	Dr_willis	millertime_018	 try it and see..
2008-11-18T08:11:00.000Z	millertime_018	Dr_willis	thanx! lol
2008-11-18T08:11:00.000Z	Dr_willis	millertime_018	 i always  set mountpoints for mine.. in the installer. :)
2008-11-18T08:13:00.000Z	Dr_willis	millertime_018	 when i install ubuntu.. you can set the mountpoint for your ntfs filesystems..
