2006-06-13T05:59:00.000Z	XiXaQ		please... This is rather important to me. If I cannot find another suitable way, can someone lend me 70MB on an ftp account please?
2006-06-13T06:01:00.000Z	dooglus	XiXaQ	how about installing an FTP server, or rsync, or sshd, or anything which they can use to send it to you?
2006-06-13T06:01:00.000Z	dooglus	XiXaQ	even 'nc -l' would do
2006-06-13T06:01:00.000Z	XiXaQ	dooglus	what does nc -l do?
2006-06-13T06:02:00.000Z	dooglus	XiXaQ	'nc -l' makes a listening 'nc'.  see 'man nc'
2006-06-13T06:02:00.000Z	XiXaQ	dooglus	my brother wants to send me one of my grandfathers cds, but I don't know how to let him.
2006-06-13T06:03:00.000Z	dooglus	XiXaQ	he's running Windows?
2006-06-13T06:03:00.000Z	XiXaQ	dooglus	I don't have that much time. Do you know of a quich solution?
2006-06-13T06:03:00.000Z	XiXaQ	dooglus	I don't know, why?
2006-06-13T06:03:00.000Z	dooglus	XiXaQ	if you don't know what he's running, it's hard to tell you how he can transfer a file to you
2006-06-13T06:04:00.000Z	dooglus	XiXaQ	how about getting him to email it in 4 parts or something?
2006-06-13T06:04:00.000Z	XiXaQ	dooglus	it's sixty megabytes. But never mind. I'll ask him to ship it via snailmail.
2006-06-13T06:05:00.000Z	dooglus	XiXaQ	that's why I suggested 4 parts.  20Mb is OK for a gmail attachment
2006-06-13T06:05:00.000Z	XiXaQ	dooglus	so he has to send four mails, or can he make four attachements to one single mail?
2006-06-13T06:06:00.000Z	dooglus	XiXaQ	I'm not sure.  but 4 mails is better - then if one fails, he only has to send that one again.
2006-06-13T06:06:00.000Z	dooglus	XiXaQ	if he's on windows though, he probably won't know how to split it into 4 parts.
2006-06-13T06:11:00.000Z	XiXaQ	dooglus	that's right. He doesn't, and I'm not able to explain it to him right now. :(
2006-11-15T07:29:00.000Z	dooglus	XiXaQ	do you have a reference for lightning?
2006-11-15T07:30:00.000Z	dooglus	XiXaQ	"Lightning 0.3 is the latest release of our calendar extension for Mozilla Thunderbird"
2006-11-15T07:31:00.000Z	dooglus	XiXaQ	ie. lightning isn't a mail client, it's a calendar plugin for thunderbird
2006-11-15T07:32:00.000Z	XiXaQ	dooglus	ok. I haven't really checked it out, because I'm very happy with Evolution. Thought maybe livingdaylight might like it though.
