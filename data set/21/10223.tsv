2005-06-20T12:35:00.000Z	mdke	concept10	there is no tool sadly
2005-06-20T12:36:00.000Z	mdke	concept10	but you can install a gui frontend which helps: http://www.marzocca.net/linux/bum.html
2005-06-20T12:37:00.000Z	concept10	mdke	I will be working with Amarath to help port the Fedora tool over to ubuntu
2005-06-20T12:37:00.000Z	mdke	concept10	you don't like that frontend?
2005-06-20T12:38:00.000Z	concept10	mdke	BUM?
2005-06-20T12:38:00.000Z	mdke	concept10	yes
2005-06-20T12:38:00.000Z	concept10	mdke	you wrote that?
2005-06-20T12:39:00.000Z	mdke	concept10	no
2005-06-20T12:39:00.000Z	concept10	mdke	I havent used it yet.  Can it restart services?
2005-06-20T12:39:00.000Z	mdke	concept10	sure
2005-06-20T12:39:00.000Z	mdke	concept10	i think ;)
2005-06-20T12:40:00.000Z	mdke	concept10	if not, i'm sure it would not be difficult to add that functionality
2005-06-21T06:13:00.000Z	mdke	concept10	did you check the channel?
2005-06-21T06:14:00.000Z	mdke	concept10	you set your net stuff in /etc/network/interfaces
2005-06-21T06:14:00.000Z	concept10	mdke	yes. I set the correct channel ESID..
2005-06-21T06:15:00.000Z	mdke	concept10	channel =/ essid
2005-06-21T06:15:00.000Z	mdke	concept10	have a look at iwconfig, and see which channel it is on, to make sure it conforms to your AP
2005-06-21T06:17:00.000Z	mdke	concept10	is that all you have?
2005-06-21T06:17:00.000Z	concept10	mdke	no didnt want to flood
2005-06-21T06:17:00.000Z	mdke	concept10	fair enough, but its strange you don't have channel
2005-06-21T06:17:00.000Z	mdke	concept10	anyhow frequency will do
