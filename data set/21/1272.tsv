2010-11-20T02:13:00.000Z	Silicone	dajhorn	also when it boots, it shows me to select between win 7 and win xp like before...
2010-11-20T02:13:00.000Z	dajhorn	Silicone	Did you say "no" when the Ubuntu installer asked "install grub?"
2010-11-20T02:14:00.000Z	Silicone	dajhorn	it doesn't asked... also i'm from live ubuntu now, and someone suggested me to reinstal grub... no help from this...
2010-11-20T02:16:00.000Z	dajhorn	Silicone	 Grub is the boot program that shows you the menu and starts Ubuntu.  You need grub, even if you want to start Microsoft Windows.
2010-11-20T02:17:00.000Z	Silicone	dajhorn	Grub is installed, also i tried to reinstall it, when reinstalled it shows me 2 OSs...  but when  restart and boot... doesn't show me the menu to choose the OS
2010-11-20T02:18:00.000Z	dajhorn	Silicone	You get that menu by holding the right <shift> button at boot time.  Did you try that?
2010-11-20T02:18:00.000Z	dajhorn	Silicone	This doesn't work when you're starting from the Ubuntu Live disc.
2010-11-20T02:19:00.000Z	Silicone	dajhorn	nope, i didn't ry.. let me try now
2010-11-20T02:47:00.000Z	dajhorn	Silicone	You probably have the Windows boot loader installed.   The advice that you were given earlier is likely correct:  Install Grub Manually.
2010-11-20T02:47:00.000Z	Silicone	dajhorn	i reinstalled.. and nothing changed
2010-11-20T02:48:00.000Z	dajhorn	Silicone	Did you run `update-grub` according to the instructions?
2010-11-20T02:48:00.000Z	dajhorn	Silicone	You're probably at the point where you'll need to pastebin a cellphone photo of the boot menu that you're getting.
