2005-04-20T13:29:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm		i've only found one distro that i like better better than ubuntu.. but the headaches it gave me just made me want a break from them
2005-04-20T13:30:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm		hehe
2005-04-20T13:30:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm		i absolutely love gentoo.. but mostly for 2 reasons
2005-04-20T13:30:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm		the speed you can achieve if done properly is insane..
2005-04-20T13:31:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm		but the real thing that has me dreaming of gentoo while using ubuntu is portage
2005-04-20T13:32:00.000Z	toresbe	i0n_st0rm	Well... The performance increases to be had with compiling it yourself are IMO overrated :)
2005-04-20T13:32:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm	toresbe	if i hadn't seen the difference myself, i would agree
2005-04-20T13:35:00.000Z	toresbe	i0n_st0rm	logged on?
2005-04-20T13:35:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm	toresbe	wouldn't have said fully usable if it wasn't
2005-04-20T13:35:00.000Z	toresbe	i0n_st0rm	WXP makes the machine look like it boots faster by putting off loading some libraries later
2005-04-20T13:35:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm	toresbe	i know all about that :)
2005-04-20T13:37:00.000Z	toresbe	i0n_st0rm	And that's just with the reference sink - I wouldn't run it much at a time though :)
2005-04-20T13:46:00.000Z	toresbe	i0n_st0rm	laptops
2005-04-20T13:47:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm	toresbe	my bad for not having experience with newer laptops :)
2005-04-20T13:47:00.000Z	toresbe	i0n_st0rm	heh heh :)
2005-04-20T13:48:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm	toresbe	you see any reason to set up a partition scheme beyond the default / and swap?
2005-04-20T13:49:00.000Z	toresbe	i0n_st0rm	nopes
2005-04-20T13:52:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm	toresbe	wanna hear something sad?
2005-04-20T13:53:00.000Z	toresbe	i0n_st0rm	what?
2005-04-20T13:53:00.000Z	i0n_st0rm	toresbe	i've only been really using linux seriously for a couple of weeks, and i still use winxp just as much.. but for some reason i can't stop using ls in windows command prompt
2005-04-20T13:54:00.000Z	toresbe	i0n_st0rm	same with me and VMS :)
