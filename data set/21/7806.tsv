2006-07-15T09:02:00.000Z	Jamo		how do I change the root's password, err sudo's password, so it isn't the same as my user account? *hasn't this occurred to anyone as being a stupid idea?
2006-07-15T09:04:00.000Z	bbrazil	Jamo	no, a general security principle
2006-07-15T09:03:00.000Z	bbrazil	Jamo	that's not how sudo works - you give it your password
2006-07-15T09:03:00.000Z	bbrazil	Jamo	root doesn't have a password in ubuntu
2006-07-15T09:03:00.000Z	Jamo	bbrazil	yes but my jamo user shouldn't have all that power
2006-07-15T09:04:00.000Z	bbrazil	Jamo	any account you use to acces root is equivilent from a security perspective
2006-07-15T09:04:00.000Z	Jamo	bbrazil	this is a fundamental security flaw in sudo?
2006-07-15T09:06:00.000Z	bbrazil	Jamo	you can if you want
2006-07-15T09:06:00.000Z	bbrazil	Jamo	at that point, just set a root password and only use root from the console
2006-07-15T09:57:00.000Z	bbrazil	Jamo	bott with the 'single' option
2006-07-15T10:01:00.000Z	bbrazil	Jamo	grub is there, it's at the very start of the disk before the partition
2006-07-15T10:01:00.000Z	Jamo	bbrazil	is there a key I can hold?
2006-07-15T10:01:00.000Z	bbrazil	Jamo	I don't know for grub - tab at the right time?
2006-07-15T10:02:00.000Z	bbrazil	Jamo	if you have an install CD you can use that
2006-07-15T10:02:00.000Z	Jamo	bbrazil	thx I'll try that
2006-07-16T05:11:00.000Z	bbrazil	Jamo	things will break
2006-07-16T05:11:00.000Z	bbrazil	Jamo	and /etc/group contains no sensitive information
2006-07-16T05:11:00.000Z	Jamo	bbrazil	you think normal users should know the group structure, ie who is in the admin group ect?
2006-07-16T05:12:00.000Z	bbrazil	Jamo	if your security depends on the mnot knowing, you have problems
2006-07-16T05:14:00.000Z	Jamo	bbrazil	by default when a user creates a file in their home directory it is readable by everyone
2006-07-16T05:15:00.000Z	bbrazil	Jamo	then change your umask
