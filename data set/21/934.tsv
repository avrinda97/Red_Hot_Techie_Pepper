2011-05-08T20:23:00.000Z	BluesKaj	ejay	what kind of scrn do you get , do youget a blinking - ,or ?
2011-05-08T20:24:00.000Z	ejay	BluesKaj	it's just stuck when the bootlogo appears and i left it overnight and was exactly the same
2011-05-08T20:25:00.000Z	BluesKaj	ejay	try the recovery kernel in the grub manu and choose "repair broken Packages " in the dialog, for starters
2011-05-08T20:25:00.000Z	BluesKaj		menu
2011-05-08T20:26:00.000Z	ejay		ok, what else is there to try?
2011-05-08T20:26:00.000Z	ejay	BluesKaj	ok, what else is there to try?
2011-05-08T20:26:00.000Z	BluesKaj		then boot normally, ejay
2011-05-08T20:28:00.000Z	ejay	BluesKaj	would disk space have anything to do with not booting?
2011-05-08T20:29:00.000Z	BluesKaj	ejay	to check diskspace, df -h  but Idoubt it unless your / prtition iis less then 6G
2011-05-08T20:29:00.000Z	ejay	BluesKaj	ok because it is around 90GB
2011-05-08T20:31:00.000Z	ejay	BluesKaj	so even if it's stuck at the bootlogo that says ubuntu and the dots underneath it, fixing the packages will work?
2011-05-08T20:32:00.000Z	ejay	BluesKaj	does this apply to my problem?  https://ubuntugenius.wordpress.com/2011/01/25/ubuntu-not-booting-try-repairing-broken-packages-in-recovery-mode/
2011-05-08T20:32:00.000Z	BluesKaj	ejay	well, it's a start , sometimes it works ,,it'd hard to know what's wrong ast that point in the boot process
2011-05-08T20:33:00.000Z	ejay	BluesKaj	so all i do is navigate to the fix broken packages thing and hit enter, right?
2011-05-08T20:34:00.000Z	BluesKaj	ejay	yes ,then you may get a boot normally optionb
2011-05-08T20:34:00.000Z	ejay	BluesKaj	ok, thank you so much!
