2006-08-11T09:45:00.000Z	harisund		oh ... that wouldn't work .... you need something to forward the graphics ..
2006-08-11T09:45:00.000Z	stian	harisund	I got the one about enableing remote desktop, however, I have no way of getting a monitor connected to the server
2006-08-11T09:46:00.000Z	stian	harisund	but is it installed? I need to actually install ubuntu on the server :)
2006-08-11T09:47:00.000Z	harisund	stian	freenxis pretty awesome actually.
2006-08-11T09:48:00.000Z	harisund	stian	,for quite some time I have been trying to figure out the ways I can access a remote computer's GUI ... I wanted a fast and neat solution.. freenx was it .. I tried SSH- X forwards, XDMCP, various VNC servers....
2006-08-11T09:48:00.000Z	stian	harisund	What I could do is try to enable vnc by hitting Alt + Ctrl F1 on the keyboard and blindly start something
2006-08-11T09:48:00.000Z	harisund	stian	the problem with VNC it is needs a GUI running on the remote machine.
2006-08-11T09:48:00.000Z	stian	harisund	the desktop installer has X
2006-08-11T09:49:00.000Z	stian	harisund	so I need to enable vnc by blindly entering something in the shell
2006-08-11T09:49:00.000Z	stian	harisund	if someone finds out what I need to enter to enable desktop sharing on the live cd I would be able to install over vnc
2006-08-11T09:49:00.000Z	harisund	stian	yeah but by blindly entering something I doubt if you would be able to correctly tell it what server to share (VNC) .. you will have to login to the gdm ..
2006-08-11T09:50:00.000Z	stian	harisund	the desktop install cd automagically boots into a loggedin gnome session
2006-08-11T09:50:00.000Z	harisund	stian	ah .. you are right ..
2006-08-11T09:50:00.000Z	stian	harisund	yes :) which leads me to believe there is a way to install :] 
2006-08-11T09:51:00.000Z	harisund	stian	good luck with that .... I sincerely doubt if you would be able to do that.. but if you could awsome
2006-08-11T09:51:00.000Z	stian	harisund	this is something that is possible in knoppix  http://www.knoppix.net/wiki/Hd_Install_Without_a_Monitor_HowTo
2006-08-11T09:52:00.000Z	stian	harisund	thanks, it's a 2,4ghz server so I'll keep trying
2006-08-11T09:53:00.000Z	harisund	stian	I know the default VNC server is called 'vino' so perhaps some manual pages might have something
2006-08-11T09:54:00.000Z	stian	harisund	thanks
2006-08-11T09:54:00.000Z	stian	harisund	i'll boot it up in vmware and play
2006-08-11T09:56:00.000Z	stian	harisund	lol, turns out there's more trouble, I can only boot from floppy :P
