2006-01-22T11:52:00.000Z	Ng	sobh_	sudo should indeed work
2006-01-22T11:52:00.000Z	sobh_		how didnt it work in my case
2006-01-22T11:52:00.000Z	Ng	sobh_	you used su, which isn't sudo
2006-01-22T11:53:00.000Z	sobh_	Ng	i see now.. but sudo useradd   add user bot not in their directories
2006-01-22T11:53:00.000Z	sobh_		wher users go ?
2006-01-22T11:53:00.000Z	Ng	sobh_	/home/

2006-01-22T11:56:00.000Z	sobh_	Ng	:/home$ ls
2006-01-22T11:56:00.000Z	sobh_	Ng	nothing
2006-01-22T11:57:00.000Z	Ng	sobh_	you must be doing something wrong then. Have you tried using the Users and Groups tool in the System menu
2006-01-22T11:58:00.000Z	sobh_	Ng	sudo only works if you are a sudouser
2006-01-22T11:59:00.000Z	sobh_	Ng	Is that got to do with anything?
