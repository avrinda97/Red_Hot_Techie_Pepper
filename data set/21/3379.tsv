2009-02-10T15:54:00.000Z	madhu		any one having any idea about the ettercap
2009-02-10T15:54:00.000Z	madhu		for sniffing
2009-02-10T15:55:00.000Z	madhu		how to sniff the things actually using ettercap ?
2009-02-10T15:56:00.000Z	Titan8990	madhu	do you have permission to sniff on the network?
2009-02-10T15:56:00.000Z	Titan8990	madhu	or own the network
2009-02-10T15:56:00.000Z	Titan8990	madhu	fstab has absolutly nothing to do with networking whatsever

2009-02-10T15:59:00.000Z	Titan8990	madhu	it will halt traffic using that guide I posted
2009-02-10T16:00:00.000Z	Titan8990	madhu	but it won't kill pid's on a remote machine
2009-02-10T16:01:00.000Z	Titan8990	madhu	no, those are iptables rules, they do not go in a config file
2009-02-10T16:02:00.000Z	Titan8990	madhu	yes, I am familiar with ettercap
2009-02-10T16:04:00.000Z	Titan8990	madhu	netbios is broadcast and doesn't need to be sniffed....
2009-02-10T16:05:00.000Z	madhu	Titan8990	,,,, i thought some one is using my ip instead of his ip,,,, it's malfunction
2009-02-10T16:07:00.000Z	Titan8990	madhu	I don't understand....
2009-02-10T16:07:00.000Z	Titan8990	madhu	you said you were doing unified sniffing
2009-02-10T16:07:00.000Z	Titan8990	madhu	so arp points to your machine
2009-02-10T16:07:00.000Z	Titan8990	madhu	and that is where internet traffic stops
2009-02-10T16:16:00.000Z	Titan8990	madhu	define "malfunction"
2009-02-10T16:17:00.000Z	Titan8990	madhu	how?
2009-02-10T16:18:00.000Z	Titan8990	madhu	what network service do you think is being exploited? what do you plan to do about it? do you own the network?
2009-02-10T16:21:00.000Z	Titan8990	madhu	wireshark is an advanced packet analyzation tool, there is nothing that will provide you with more information
