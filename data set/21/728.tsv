2011-07-14T09:39:00.000Z	e_t_	billy2007	That's OK, so long as the kernel modules are gone. Run "lsmod | grep vbox" and tell me if you get anything.
2011-07-14T09:40:00.000Z	billy2007	e_t_	nothing
2011-07-14T09:41:00.000Z	e_t_	billy2007	Now do the install command and paste the output.
2011-07-14T09:45:00.000Z	e_t_	billy2007	Did you previously install the version from Oracle?
2011-07-14T09:46:00.000Z	billy2007	e_t_	i think so
2011-07-14T09:47:00.000Z	e_t_	billy2007	OK. That's why it's not working now. The virtualbox-ose version is only at 4.0.4 while the one from Oracle is 4.0.10. It won't replace a newer version with an older version.
2011-07-14T09:48:00.000Z	e_t_	billy2007	Do you still have the downloaded file from Oracle?
2011-07-14T09:49:00.000Z	e_t_	billy2007	Download it again, then "sudo dpkg -i /path/to/downloaded/file"
2011-07-14T09:50:00.000Z	e_t_	billy2007	It wouldn't hurt to do so, just to be safe.
2011-07-14T09:59:00.000Z	billy2007	e_t_	i think this is the one

2011-07-14T10:06:00.000Z	billy2007	e_t_	you still here?
2011-07-14T10:07:00.000Z	e_t_	billy2007	I'm here, just studying up.
2011-07-14T10:11:00.000Z	billy2007	e_t_	 this is result from dpkg command
2011-07-14T10:12:00.000Z	e_t_	billy2007	Spelling or typing errors are most likely. Linux is cAsE sensitive, so "downloads" is different from "Downloads".
