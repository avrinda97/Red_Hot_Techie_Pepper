2008-07-13T02:00:00.000Z	xxschwartzxx		hmmm...
2008-07-13T02:00:00.000Z	xxschwartzxx		then what is formatting i might have it wrong..
2008-07-13T02:01:00.000Z	td123	xxschwartzxx	formatting is when create a fresh filesystem (empty)
2008-07-13T03:09:00.000Z	td123	xxschwartzxx	don't delete that image just yet though
2008-07-13T03:09:00.000Z	td123	xxschwartzxx	use torrent to patch up that file and it'll be the same thing
2008-07-13T03:12:00.000Z	td123	xxschwartzxx	find the torrent file that matches your iso, put broken iso into directory where torrent will dl the torrent, prog should automatically fetch the parts of the file that are wrong and you won't have to do a 700mb download again
2008-07-13T03:13:00.000Z	td123	xxschwartzxx	didn't you just say its 650mb yet none of the isos are that size?
2008-07-13T03:13:00.000Z	td123	xxschwartzxx	omg
2008-07-13T03:14:00.000Z	td123	xxschwartzxx	sry, i misread, I have to skim the posts because this channel  moves quickly :)
2008-07-13T03:15:00.000Z	td123	xxschwartzxx	gl then :P
2008-07-13T03:15:00.000Z	xxschwartzxx	td123	it says on the guide im reading to diconnect my internal hd during installation to my external, how do i disconnect and internal hd? The only thing i have done is replaced my RAM..
2008-07-13T03:16:00.000Z	td123	xxschwartzxx	what? If you just installed more ram to your computer, then you should do nothing like that, it should work when you power your computer on again...
2008-07-13T03:17:00.000Z	xxschwartzxx	td123	no im just wondering how do you disconnect and internal hd
2008-07-13T03:17:00.000Z	td123	xxschwartzxx	well, you have to go into the computer, unplug the IDE cable and the power plug and you should be set
2008-07-13T03:18:00.000Z	td123	xxschwartzxx	yes, to remove the hdd, you must remove ide and power plug connected to hdd..
2008-07-13T03:19:00.000Z	td123	xxschwartzxx	but do all this with the power cable to the computer also unplugged :)
