2010-09-28T03:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sinman	10Gb is plenty
2010-09-28T03:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sinman	make swap the same amount as your ram for 2Gb ram and more, or 2x ram if you have less, then use the rest for /home
2010-09-28T03:05:00.000Z	sinman	ActionParsnip	thanxs, i do got way to big currently it's 155Gb
2010-09-28T03:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sinman	yikes, dude my used has never been over 3Gb with any linux
2010-09-28T03:06:00.000Z	sinman	ActionParsnip	i have 2GB ram
2010-09-28T03:06:00.000Z	sinman	ActionParsnip	it's a learning expiernce for me
2010-09-28T03:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sinman	then make swap be 2Gb, / be 10Gb and home be the remaining 978Gb
2010-09-28T03:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sinman	you can even break up the /home so you have a partition for each type of media, like pics, vids etc. One big /home is no bad thing though. the ext4 specification allows it
2010-09-28T03:07:00.000Z	sinman	ActionParsnip	k that does sound good. but i'll make home smaller in case i want to dual boot in the future with a differnt distro
2010-09-28T03:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sinman	sounds cool, partition planning is good :)
2010-09-28T03:08:00.000Z	sinman	ActionParsnip	i had always used the ext4 for home, is it good to use ext4 for / or should i use ext3 for it
2010-09-28T03:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sinman	depends, some games install to /opt, some to $HOME
2010-09-28T03:14:00.000Z	sinman	ActionParsnip	k
2010-09-28T03:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sinman	if you like FPS, grab the penumbra demos (scary) or urbanterror (counterstrike like game)
2010-09-28T03:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sinman	lxde, e17
2010-09-28T03:15:00.000Z	sinman	ActionParsnip	i use to be in fps in the past, but these days it's mostly mmo's and mmorpg's
2010-09-28T03:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sinman	sugar is another
