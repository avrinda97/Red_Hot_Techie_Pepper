2004-12-18T08:30:00.000Z	sulkd		yeah.. glade is in the repos, just search for glade-gnome with Synaptic
2004-12-18T08:31:00.000Z	scoon	sulkd	but we are discussing java-gnome
2004-12-18T08:31:00.000Z	scoon	sulkd	i use glade to layout my gui's with java-gnome
2004-12-18T08:32:00.000Z	scoon	sulkd	i use glade for java as well.
2004-12-18T08:33:00.000Z	scoon	sulkd	quite frankly it is the best gui layer-outter there is ;)
2004-12-18T08:34:00.000Z	sulkd	scoon	best one I've used, atleast
2004-12-18T08:34:00.000Z	scoon	sulkd	well i have used a couple other ones and glade wins
2005-02-03T10:09:00.000Z	scoon	sulkd	they are all frontends to cdrecord.
2005-02-03T10:09:00.000Z	scoon	sulkd	why not pull up a man page and just use cdrecord CLI
2005-02-03T10:11:00.000Z	sulkd	scoon	why waste time tracking down cdrecord's 130 fixme switches when I could just boot into windows and use nero
2005-02-03T10:11:00.000Z	scoon	sulkd	for starters i don't dual boot.  linux is it.  and has been for over 6yrs.
2005-02-03T10:12:00.000Z	sulkd	scoon	great scots.. it's been 8 years here started with redhat 4.2, kiddo
2005-02-03T10:12:00.000Z	scoon	sulkd	well i am sorry that you dual boot then .
2005-02-03T10:12:00.000Z	scoon	sulkd	still.
2005-02-03T10:15:00.000Z	sulkd	scoon	the problem with cdrecord is that it isn't really a piece of application software, it's more a frontend's engine anyway... since the developer made no effort at all to make any choices for the user, but just mirrored the available options provided by the ioctl interface of the drivers and just pile on the options.. no man should ever have to get that intimate with his cdrw/dvdr recorder just to backup some data
2005-02-03T10:15:00.000Z	scoon	sulkd	how hard is this: cdrecord dev=ATAPI:/dev/hdc foo.iso
2005-02-03T10:17:00.000Z	sulkd	scoon	not too hard, but that wouldn't work very well on my system.. plus, I'd have to mkisofs
2005-02-03T10:17:00.000Z	sulkd	scoon	I'll grant you, growisofs is allright in my book
2005-02-03T10:18:00.000Z	sulkd	scoon	and yes I realize it is a frontend for cdcrecord
2005-02-03T10:18:00.000Z	scoon	sulkd	eh.  if you like the one, then you could like them both.
2005-02-03T10:18:00.000Z	scoon	sulkd	all right.  lets just agree to disagree then.  this is sorta silly.
