2010-06-14T00:16:00.000Z	jrtroberts		hi all, have an issue with ubuntu 10.04x64  it will not recognize my 8gigs of ram.  although it is recognized in the bios.  I am running Memtest86 at the moment, if the ram passes what else could be the problem?
2010-06-14T00:16:00.000Z	jrtroberts		x64
2010-06-14T00:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jrtroberts	can you give the output of: uname -a   please
2010-06-14T00:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jrtroberts	can you give the -a output please
2010-06-14T00:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jrtroberts	ok no worries, let it finish a test
2010-06-14T00:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jrtroberts	x86_64   or i686
2010-06-14T00:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jrtroberts	sounds like a 32bit kernel to me
2010-06-14T00:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jrtroberts	can you also give the output of: sudo apt-get -y install pastebinit; lsb_release -a     thanks
2010-06-14T00:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jrtroberts	its easier, the pastebin command is dead handy
2010-06-14T00:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jrtroberts	lsb_release -a | pastebinit
2010-06-14T00:41:00.000Z	jrtroberts	ActionParsnip	http://pastebin.com/ej0KdLcx  sorry haven't used irc much.. stll got a learning curve
2010-06-14T00:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jrtroberts	try: cd /var/cache/apt/archives; file * | pastebinit
2010-06-14T00:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jrtroberts	ok so they are all amd64 based
2010-06-14T00:47:00.000Z	jrtroberts	ActionParsnip	ok so where does that leave me?  Back to the memory test?  or could their be another culprit?
2010-06-14T00:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jrtroberts	not sure fellah, could try reinstalling linux-image   then check the arch of the deb in the archives folder
2010-06-14T01:10:00.000Z	jrtroberts	ActionParsnip	http://pastebin.com/sXFTqFrV  does this mean anything to you? from a python script I found check-my-hardware.py
2010-06-14T01:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jrtroberts	if you boot an older kernel is it ok?
2010-06-14T01:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jrtroberts	you will have a few on the system by default, hold shift at boot and choose the older one
2010-06-14T01:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jrtroberts	thats a release, not a kernel
2010-06-14T01:15:00.000Z	jrtroberts	ActionParsnip	nope same deal  http://pastebin.com/sXvPps9Y  the only older kernel I have is the .21
2010-06-14T01:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jrtroberts	no idea then dude
