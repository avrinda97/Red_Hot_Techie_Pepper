2005-11-16T17:41:00.000Z	LjL	fruud	install kdelibs4-dev
2005-11-16T17:42:00.000Z	LjL	fruud	using aptitude, possibly, as otherwise you'll have lots of dependencies to remove later
2005-11-16T17:42:00.000Z	LjL	fruud	(if you want to remove them, that is)
2005-11-16T06:11:00.000Z	LjL	fruud	care to be a little more specific?
2005-11-16T06:13:00.000Z	LjL	fruud	URL?
2005-11-16T06:13:00.000Z	LjL	fruud	also, can you give me the URL you downloaded that knifty from, so i can try compiling it?
2005-11-16T06:14:00.000Z	LjL	fruud	from the errors you gave, it looks like that program is broken with ubuntu, but let me give it a try
2005-11-16T06:15:00.000Z	LjL	fruud	that URL is about "silver deco", which isn't a compilable package...
2005-11-16T06:16:00.000Z	LjL	fruud	what's URL to the archive you're actually trying to *compile*? i suppose it's knifty, but
2005-11-16T06:18:00.000Z	fruud	LjL	will this work for me ? Really want that one ( http://www.kde-look.org/content/show.php?content=12330 )
2005-11-16T06:21:00.000Z	LjL	fruud	just hold on some minutes, i've got to install the kde devs package to compile that stuff
2005-11-16T06:25:00.000Z	LjL	fruud	you're using the wrong version of KNifty, you need this one: http://kde-look.org/content/show.php?content=8841
2005-11-16T06:27:00.000Z	fruud	LjL	this one  ( http://www.kde-look.org/content/show.php?content=12330 )
2005-11-16T06:28:00.000Z	LjL	fruud	that one doesn't seem to have anything to do with KNifty. let me try to compile it as well
2005-11-16T06:29:00.000Z	fruud	LjL	Still getting humooongos errors of that knifty u gave me :O
2005-11-16T06:32:00.000Z	LjL	fruud	install also kdebase-dev, and it should work
