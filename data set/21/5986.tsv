2007-06-29T11:27:00.000Z	DarkFame	reed026	that's normal if you don't have any other OSes installed (no menu displayed, grub boots OS directly)
2007-06-29T11:29:00.000Z	reed026	DarkFame	it doesn't load an OS though
2007-06-29T11:30:00.000Z	DarkFame	reed026	what's the last line before it reboots?
2007-06-29T11:37:00.000Z	DarkFame	reed026	ok, are you able to boot anything? memtest86?
2007-06-29T11:38:00.000Z	DarkFame	reed026	has it ever been working?
2007-06-29T11:38:00.000Z	DarkFame	reed026	I mean, this install.
2007-06-29T11:39:00.000Z	DarkFame	reed026	I'd try a reinstall then, repartition your harddrive.
2007-06-29T11:40:00.000Z	DarkFame	reed026	ok, how did you partition it?
2007-06-29T11:42:00.000Z	DarkFame	reed026	what kind of computer is this?
2007-06-29T11:43:00.000Z	DarkFame	reed026	the problem is your /boot partition you see.
2007-06-29T11:43:00.000Z	DarkFame	reed026	BIOS date?
2007-06-29T12:00:00.000Z	DarkFame	reed026	just use the ubuntu installer to remove the partitions.. but make /boot ext2 not ext3
2007-06-29T12:13:00.000Z	reed026	DarkFame	I'm going to try this one more time.
2007-06-29T12:17:00.000Z	DarkFame	reed026	that's weird.
2007-06-29T12:20:00.000Z	DarkFame	reed026	it shouldn't be any problem
2007-06-29T12:21:00.000Z	DarkFame	reed026	I've looked up error 18 to be sure, and yes... it's due to the /boot partition not being placed at the beginning of the harddrive.
2007-06-29T12:22:00.000Z	DarkFame	reed026	are you running the latest BIOS btw?
2007-06-29T12:29:00.000Z	DarkFame	reed026	don't install WinNT, just use a floppy
2007-06-29T12:30:00.000Z	DarkFame	reed026	just download
2007-06-29T12:39:00.000Z	DarkFame	reed026	isn't it just a .img file? dd if=image.img of=/dev/floppy
2007-06-29T12:40:00.000Z	DarkFame	reed026	ok.. it's not a floppy image.
