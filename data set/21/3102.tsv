2009-04-25T04:58:00.000Z	Leemp		Question: Is there a known problem with the Fglrx Driver and 9.04? I just fresh installed ubuntu, installed fglr & the control center, and my computer couldn't even boot up. I had to boot into root safe mode, and purge the driver. Any ideas?
2009-04-25T04:59:00.000Z	minimec	Leemp	I have no ideas... but you are not the first one. Some try to use fglrx with not supported cards, others have fglrx problems with supported cards.
2009-04-25T05:00:00.000Z	Leemp	minimec	I forget my card model, but its the mac pro ati, and i was using fglrx on 8.10 with no issues. I'll try to dig somethin up, thanks minimec & daftykins
2009-04-25T05:01:00.000Z	Leemp	minimec	Is there a secondary driver that i can use instead of fglrx? Or is that the default i already have installed?
2009-04-25T05:02:00.000Z	minimec	Leemp	the opensource driver is installed by default. there is another radeonhd, bur it's early stage.
2009-04-25T05:02:00.000Z	Leemp	minimec	K thanks
2009-04-25T05:03:00.000Z	minimec	Leemp	http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/linux/legacy/Pages/radeon_linux.aspx?type=2.7&product=2.7.4.3.3.3.1&lang=English For these card there is no fglrx driver in jaunty
2009-04-25T05:03:00.000Z	Leemp	minimec	Did this just take place in jaunty?
2009-04-25T05:04:00.000Z	minimec	Leemp	Jaunty uses xorg 1.6 There is no driver for xorg 1.6 for the cards on the upper link.
2009-04-25T05:05:00.000Z	Leemp	minimec	Any idea how to figure out what card i have? Eg, is there somethin in jaunty that can fix it?
2009-04-25T05:05:00.000Z	minimec	Leemp	Open a terminal and type 'lspci |grep VGA'
2009-04-25T05:06:00.000Z	Leemp	minimec	Bah, yea i have the X1900 XT
2009-04-25T05:07:00.000Z	Leemp	minimec	So this is permanent? There will be no fglrx? Or is it just a delay, in releasing it?
2009-04-25T05:07:00.000Z	minimec	Leemp	So you can use the opensource driver (you are probably using it right now), or switch back to intrepid.
2009-04-25T05:07:00.000Z	Leemp	minimec	bummer, k thanks
2009-04-25T05:07:00.000Z	Leemp	minimec	I think i just need to buy a new graphics card :D
2009-04-25T05:08:00.000Z	minimec	Leemp	Step back to intrepid, if you have problems and wait some month. The driver will improve, because ATI gave the source to the community.
2009-04-25T05:08:00.000Z	Leemp	minimec	Ooo
2009-04-25T05:09:00.000Z	Leemp	minimec	Well if i dont have issues, im fine. As long as it works well with my multiple monitor setup. Thats the main priority.
2009-04-25T05:10:00.000Z	minimec	Leemp	Good luck. I have a two screen system with a nvidia 7600gt. Really painless... ;)
2009-04-25T05:11:00.000Z	Leemp	minimec	Well it didnt work in intrepid, i had to use fglrx. So far its not working, but it wants me to restart the desktop, so we'll see once i do
