2010-05-24T22:49:00.000Z	gnomefreak	dominicdinada	try mediubuntu repos
2010-05-24T22:49:00.000Z	dominicdinada	gnomefreak	i have the medibuntu repos installed
2010-05-24T22:50:00.000Z	dominicdinada	gnomefreak	aptitude search media results no codec packs :(
2010-05-24T22:50:00.000Z	gnomefreak	dominicdinada	you didnt read the link ubottu gave you
2010-05-24T22:51:00.000Z	dominicdinada	gnomefreak	A that how to is useless... well at least with Totem. B i already did that long ago and still no avail
2010-05-24T22:52:00.000Z	dominicdinada	gnomefreak	following the howto guide and reinstalling the restrict codecs 2 or 10 times doesnt change the fact that even still things dont work :(
2010-05-24T22:52:00.000Z	gnomefreak	dominicdinada	did you go look at mediubuntu like i had said?
2010-05-24T22:53:00.000Z	gnomefreak	dominicdinada	or even the link that was given to you from ubottu it will tell you what to install and from where to get it
2010-05-24T22:53:00.000Z	dominicdinada	gnomefreak	Let me double check because i am sure i have the repos on here
2010-05-24T22:54:00.000Z	dominicdinada	gnomefreak	I do have the mediabutu repos installed...
2010-05-24T22:55:00.000Z	gnomefreak	dominicdinada	did you look at the libs to install from the wiki link?
2010-05-24T22:56:00.000Z	dominicdinada	gnomefreak	I have installed all the libs, and apt files from that link at least 5 times. How can i make that more clear ?
2010-05-24T22:57:00.000Z	gnomefreak	dominicdinada	if it is not working in any media player than you do not have the correct ones or at least not all of them
2010-05-24T22:57:00.000Z	dominicdinada	gnomefreak	Well this origional question was Rythmbox as it offers library support
2010-05-24T22:58:00.000Z	dominicdinada	gnomefreak	I stand corrected on the mediabuntu ... I have the software center added for it but it only has 8 files listed :(
2010-05-24T22:58:00.000Z	gnomefreak	dominicdinada	i dont have a problem with rythmbox playing mp3 or any other extensions that i have
2010-05-24T22:58:00.000Z	gnomefreak	dominicdinada	dont use softwarecenter use synaptic
2010-05-24T22:59:00.000Z	gnomefreak	dominicdinada	software center works great for our supported packages but not so well on unsupport packages
2010-05-24T22:59:00.000Z	dominicdinada	gnomefreak	BLAH i said I stood corrected :)
