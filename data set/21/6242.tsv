2009-03-02T01:17:00.000Z	user_	rubberducky	maybe you need to have the configure-file created first. what does the docu say?
2009-03-02T01:17:00.000Z	rubberducky	user_	docu says copy linux.mak to port.mak if you us elinux and run make
2009-03-02T01:17:00.000Z	rubberducky		and make install
2009-03-02T01:18:00.000Z	user_	rubberducky	does linux.mak fit your setup?
2009-03-02T01:18:00.000Z	rubberducky		i use linux:D
2009-03-02T01:19:00.000Z	rubberducky	user_	so yes probably
2009-03-02T01:19:00.000Z	user_	rubberducky	linux is like 'Car'. there a tons of different models ;-)  why you want to compile by yourself btw?
2009-03-02T01:20:00.000Z	rubberducky		cross compile
2009-03-02T01:21:00.000Z	user_	rubberducky	ps. please quote nicks when replying
2009-03-02T01:22:00.000Z	rubberducky	user_	cause i want to cross compile it
2009-03-02T01:22:00.000Z	user_	rubberducky	ah crosscompile good luck then. you're sure the task wasnt already solved by someone else? like a patch f.e.?
2009-03-02T01:23:00.000Z	rubberducky	user_	but first i want to try to compile it nromally
2009-03-02T01:23:00.000Z	rubberducky		just make
2009-03-02T01:24:00.000Z	user_	rubberducky	have you checked the ubuntu source package. does it contain patches?
2009-03-02T01:24:00.000Z	rubberducky	user_	but its precompile
2009-03-02T01:25:00.000Z	user_	rubberducky	(almost) every ubuntu package also has a source package, just check in the package manager
2009-03-02T01:26:00.000Z	user_		!source | rubberducky
2009-03-02T01:26:00.000Z	rubberducky	user_	how do i get the source from apackage?
2009-03-02T01:26:00.000Z	user_		!source | rubberducky
2009-03-02T01:27:00.000Z	rubberducky	user_	thanks
