2009-12-09T04:50:00.000Z	crohakon		I updated to 9.10 and now I cannot watch flash video in firefox, how do I fix this?
2009-12-09T04:50:00.000Z	deleuzer	crohakon	do you have nvidia drivers?
2009-12-09T04:51:00.000Z	crohakon	deleuzer	yes.
2009-12-09T04:51:00.000Z	deleuzer	crohakon	check and see if the hardware drivers are installed System >> Admin >> Hardware Drivers
2009-12-09T04:52:00.000Z	crohakon	deleuzer	eh?
2009-12-09T04:52:00.000Z	deleuzer	crohakon	the third party nvidia drivers
2009-12-09T04:52:00.000Z	crohakon	deleuzer	they should be... they were before the upgrade
2009-12-09T04:53:00.000Z	crohakon	deleuzer	yes, they are still installed.
2009-12-09T04:53:00.000Z	deleuzer	crohakon	there's an issue with upgrading with the nvidia drivers still installed, you may need to uninstall them, reboot and reinstall them
2009-12-09T04:54:00.000Z	crohakon	deleuzer	is there a guide on how to do that? And would it not be helpful for ubuntu upgrade to state that before the upgrade starts? lol
2009-12-09T04:54:00.000Z	deleuzer	crohakon	probably the best way is to modify your xorg.conf change the nvidia driver to nw then reboot
2009-12-09T04:54:00.000Z	crohakon	deleuzer	nw?
2009-12-09T04:54:00.000Z	deleuzer	crohakon	that's the default open drivers for nvidia
2009-12-09T04:55:00.000Z	crohakon	deleuzer	I can still watch video via hulu desktop
2009-12-09T04:55:00.000Z	crohakon	deleuzer	just not from youtube via firefox
2009-12-09T04:55:00.000Z	deleuzer	crohakon	can you make hulu full screen?
2009-12-09T04:56:00.000Z	crohakon	deleuzer	yes
2009-12-09T04:56:00.000Z	deleuzer	crohakon	have you restarted firefox?
2009-12-09T04:57:00.000Z	crohakon	deleuzer	yes, I rebooted after the upgrade
2009-12-09T04:57:00.000Z	deleuzer	crohakon	I just want to make sure it's not some firefox caching issue.
2009-12-09T04:57:00.000Z	crohakon	deleuzer	nevermind, now it seems to work... *growls* Thanks for the help.
