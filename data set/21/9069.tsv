2006-03-19T14:11:00.000Z	pilgrim		Hi all. I want to install and start sshd. How do I do this in ubuntu?
2006-03-19T14:12:00.000Z	pilgrim		How do I install Open-SSH?
2006-03-19T14:13:00.000Z	rukuartic	pilgrim	sudo apt-get install openssh
2006-03-19T14:14:00.000Z	rukuartic	pilgrim	then after that, make sure if you're running a firewall that you configure ports right
2006-03-19T14:14:00.000Z	pilgrim	rukuartic	E: Couldn't find package openssh
2006-03-19T14:14:00.000Z	rukuartic	pilgrim	Hold up real quick
2006-03-19T14:14:00.000Z	rukuartic	pilgrim	sudo apt-get install openssh-server
2006-03-19T14:15:00.000Z	pilgrim	rukuartic	thanks. Now the firewall thing? How do I do that?
2006-03-19T14:15:00.000Z	rukuartic	pilgrim	Make sure you have port 22 open :P
2006-03-19T14:16:00.000Z	pilgrim	rukuartic	heh. I know that, but how?
2006-03-19T14:16:00.000Z	rukuartic	pilgrim	Find another computer, and run ssh user@youripaddress
2006-03-19T14:16:00.000Z	pilgrim	rukuartic	no no. How do I get to the firewall config?
2006-03-19T14:17:00.000Z	rukuartic	pilgrim	Are you running a firewall?
2006-03-19T14:17:00.000Z	pilgrim	rukuartic	isn't there a default one runing?
2006-03-19T14:17:00.000Z	rukuartic	pilgrim	Shouldn't be, unless you've got a hardware one (your router)
2006-03-19T14:18:00.000Z	rukuartic	pilgrim	If you want, you could make a test user and I could try to get in
2006-03-19T14:18:00.000Z	pilgrim	rukuartic	yeah the router I got...damn..no firewall eh.....hmm...damn...fedora was nice for this.
2006-03-19T14:18:00.000Z	pilgrim	rukuartic	I got computer at home. no worries.
2006-03-19T14:19:00.000Z	pilgrim	rukuartic	I got computer(s) .so I can test the connection. But the firewall thing is shocking me.
2006-03-19T14:19:00.000Z	rukuartic	pilgrim	You're fine O_o don't worry about it. If you can't connect from the outside though, you probably should check to make sure you don't have any problems
2006-03-19T14:23:00.000Z	pilgrim	rukuartic	SSHing works. How do I open close ports in Ubuntu?
