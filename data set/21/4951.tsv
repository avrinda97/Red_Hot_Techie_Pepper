2011-06-29T08:26:00.000Z	imperfect-		that might also might give me some Detach capability
2011-06-29T08:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	imperfect-	what do you do on the remote system?
2011-06-29T08:26:00.000Z	imperfect-	ActionParsnip	Use it?
2011-06-29T08:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	imperfect-	sure but in what way? what do you do?
2011-06-29T08:26:00.000Z	imperfect-	ActionParsnip	I use screen for most things, but I'd like a graphical version of screen ;)
2011-06-29T08:27:00.000Z	imperfect-	ActionParsnip	Spreadsheets, vmware stuff etc
2011-06-29T08:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	imperfect-	not thought about using SSH to give SFTP and SSHS?
2011-06-29T08:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	imperfect-	vmware has a VIC which you can control remote systems with
2011-06-29T08:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	imperfect-	sorry SSHFS
2011-06-29T08:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	imperfect-	no, SSHFS is like samba, but secure
2011-06-29T08:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	imperfect-	so you can use the LOCAL apps to the client system and open the files over a secure share, rather than slow accessing over a full screen
2011-06-29T08:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	imperfect-	this is why I asked what you do
2011-06-29T08:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	imperfect-	its very often not needed and there are much sleekr options available
2011-06-29T08:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	imperfect-	you could install ubuntu minimal then install lxde and lxdm for a super tiny punchy OS :)
2011-06-29T08:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	imperfect-	sure, check it out. Its super light. Its an alternative to kde or gnome
2011-06-29T08:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	imperfect-	its made to be super light and fast. It rocks and is official status as of Oneiric :D
2011-06-29T08:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	imperfect-	openbox is the default WM of LXDE
2011-06-29T08:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	imperfect-	you can just run openbox on its own, without LXDE, makes it faster
2011-06-29T08:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	imperfect-	lxde is a desktop environment like gnome or kde
2011-06-29T09:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	imperfect-	setup samba shares, if your google tv can  read windows shares you are smug. XBMC also can setup a streaming server. Depends what the device can do
