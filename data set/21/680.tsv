2011-08-02T02:45:00.000Z	artifical_24		Would it matter if I installed the desktop version of ubuntu on a netbook?
2011-08-02T02:45:00.000Z	smw	artifical_24	I do not believe there is a separate netbook edition anymore
2011-08-02T02:45:00.000Z	smw	artifical_24	you are supposed to usee the desktop one
2011-08-02T02:46:00.000Z	artifical_24	smw	Part of the issue is that I just installed ubuntu on my netbook and.. I noticed it wasn't even noticing my wireless device.
2011-08-02T02:46:00.000Z	smw	artifical_24	you may need to install restricted drivers
2011-08-02T02:47:00.000Z	artifical_24	smw	However I plugged it to a lan connection and its pulling updates right now
2011-08-02T02:50:00.000Z	artifical_24	smw	Where would I find the addictional drivers program.
2011-08-02T02:50:00.000Z	smw	artifical_24	no idea how to navigate unity. I can tell you the command line way.
2011-08-02T02:50:00.000Z	artifical_24	smw	Sure
2011-08-02T02:51:00.000Z	smw	artifical_24	gksu jockey-gtk
2011-08-02T02:51:00.000Z	smw	artifical_24	do that after updating package lists
2011-08-02T02:58:00.000Z	artifical_24	smw	another thing I did was lspci | grep Network
2011-08-02T02:58:00.000Z	artifical_24	smw	And my wifi card STILL wont show up even after the update
2011-08-02T02:59:00.000Z	smw	artifical_24	didn't show up in additional drivers? What about lshw -c network
2011-08-02T02:59:00.000Z	smw	artifical_24	ifconfig -a?
2011-08-02T03:01:00.000Z	artifical_24	smw	Ever since I took it to geeksquad/bestbuy to have the monitor fixed, they shipped it off somewhere and replaced the monitor but took my hard drive out and replace it and gave me a system with no operating system and my wifi worked then(though I had windows then) but even after those two commands that you told me that I just entered I only see my ethernet hardware
2011-08-02T03:02:00.000Z	smw	artifical_24	maybe it is a bios setting to enable wifi? That happens some times
2011-08-02T03:02:00.000Z	artifical_24	smw	Do you think they took my wireless card out and forgot to put it back in? Is that possible? (If it is I am going to surely **** them up) XD
2011-08-02T03:02:00.000Z	artifical_24	smw	Checking
2011-08-02T03:04:00.000Z	artifical_24	smw	Checked. Nothing in the BIOS at all indicated anything much about the wireless except sometype of "Wake-on LAN"
2011-08-02T03:05:00.000Z	smw	artifical_24	no idea than
