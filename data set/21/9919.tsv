2006-05-04T06:20:00.000Z	TokenBad		is there a way to network a windows computer and ubuntu so can share files between them?
2006-05-04T06:21:00.000Z	tarvid	TokenBad	yes
2006-05-04T06:21:00.000Z	TokenBad	tarvid	you have a link that explains it?
2006-05-04T06:21:00.000Z	tarvid	TokenBad	samba will talk to and share files
2006-05-04T06:22:00.000Z	TokenBad	tarvid	is it easy to setup?
2006-05-04T06:23:00.000Z	tarvid	TokenBad	I would guess there is a gui utility in Ubuntu somewhere
2006-05-04T06:24:00.000Z	tarvid	TokenBad	I use a limited subset with smbfs mount of windows shares so I can back them up on Linuc, that is from Windows to Linux
2006-05-04T06:24:00.000Z	tarvid	TokenBad	the other way around requires more and samba is the most common choice
2006-05-04T06:25:00.000Z	tarvid	TokenBad	webmin has a section for setting up samba shares as does swat
2006-05-04T06:26:00.000Z	tarvid	TokenBad	the biggest gotcha in getting things to work is that windows 9x does passwords in the clear, 2000 does encrypted passwords and xp will do either
2006-05-04T06:26:00.000Z	tarvid	TokenBad	there is a small registry change for 2000 and doing passwords in the clear will work for both 9x and xp
2006-05-04T06:33:00.000Z	TokenBad	tarvid	yeah this is a 98 machine
2006-05-04T06:34:00.000Z	tarvid	TokenBad	do you mean a dual boot, if these are two separate machines set passwords to clear in samba
2006-05-04T06:34:00.000Z	tarvid	TokenBad	just noticed a file sharing item under system administration
2006-05-04T06:35:00.000Z	tarvid	TokenBad	install samba, webmin, webmin core and see if webmin will give gui access to you samba mounts, do set passwords to clear text
2006-05-04T07:00:00.000Z	tarvid	TokenBad	it is confusing, your head may hurt a little, try to log in to webmin - https://localhost:10000/
2006-05-04T07:02:00.000Z	tarvid	TokenBad	look for samba under servers
2006-05-04T07:03:00.000Z	tarvid	TokenBad	try sudo apt-get install webmin-core, webmin alone comes up bare
2006-05-04T07:03:00.000Z	tarvid	TokenBad	webmin and debian part ways over apache, I hop samba works
2006-05-04T07:05:00.000Z	tarvid	TokenBad	my bad, this is going to get even more difficult
2006-05-04T07:09:00.000Z	tarvid	TokenBad	i apologize, i am probably leading you into the tulips. http://www.howtoforge.com/samba_setup_ubuntu_5.10_p5?from=10&comments_per_page=10 describes a domain server setup which is more complicated than you need but maybe it will help
