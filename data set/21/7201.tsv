2007-01-30T15:41:00.000Z	Jowi	AWOSLappy	did you get an answer to your question?
2007-01-30T15:41:00.000Z	Jowi	AWOSLappy	about sorting installed packages by size?
2007-01-30T15:43:00.000Z	Jowi	AWOSLappy	I got curious so I did some research. here's how I did it "dpkg-query -W -f='${Installed-Size} ${Package}\n' | sort -g -r > allfiles.txt"    -  Created allfiles.txt to be opened in an editor since the list can be quite long...
2007-01-30T15:43:00.000Z	Jowi	AWOSLappy	sizes are listed in kb
2007-01-30T15:44:00.000Z	Jowi	AWOSLappy	you're welcome. and thanks Akeru :)
2007-01-30T15:45:00.000Z	Jowi	AWOSLappy	bah, ruining the fun with the texteditor ;)
2007-01-30T15:45:00.000Z	AWOSLappy	Jowi	hehe
2007-01-30T15:45:00.000Z	AWOSLappy	Jowi	like I said I have no disk space free (df -h reports 0 free and 100% usage) so that's why I need this :P
2007-01-30T15:46:00.000Z	Jowi	AWOSLappy	first thing that can free up some space is to do a "sudo apt-get clean" to delete downloaded packages that are still laying aroung
2007-01-30T15:46:00.000Z	AWOSLappy	Jowi	oh right
2007-01-30T15:47:00.000Z	Jowi	AWOSLappy	that will free up a couple of 100s of meg probably
2007-01-30T15:47:00.000Z	AWOSLappy	Jowi	it freed up 5.8M
2007-01-30T15:47:00.000Z	AWOSLappy	Jowi	I've done this frequently (run out of disk space and run apt-get clean)
2007-02-16T14:44:00.000Z	Jowi	AWOSLappy	try updating the font cache, log out and in again. "sudo fc-cache -fv"
2007-02-16T14:45:00.000Z	Jowi	AWOSLappy	don't know. a bit strange. what prog is not accepting the font?
2007-02-16T14:47:00.000Z	Jowi	AWOSLappy	hmmm, no idea about kde specific things unfortunately. if gtk apps work I would guess kde/qt apps would as well.
2007-02-16T14:48:00.000Z	Jowi	AWOSLappy	I think OOo is built on something else.
2007-02-16T14:48:00.000Z	Jowi	AWOSLappy	try mousepad, gedit or abiword.
2007-02-16T14:51:00.000Z	Jowi	AWOSLappy	It would be nice to test if the problem is kde specific. kwrite is written for kde - mousepad, abiword or gedit uses gtk.
2007-02-16T15:04:00.000Z	Jowi	AWOSLappy	first time I've seen a message like that. sorry
2007-02-16T15:05:00.000Z	Jowi	AWOSLappy	think you better. could the font be corrupted?
