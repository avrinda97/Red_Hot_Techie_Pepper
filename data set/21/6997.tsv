2007-09-21T05:31:00.000Z	Sasa		would  "use largest continuous free space" option forego NTFS and just install it on the unpartitioned space??
2007-09-21T05:31:00.000Z	Chousuke	Sasa	yes.
2007-09-21T05:31:00.000Z	Chousuke	Sasa	if I understood you correctly..
2007-09-21T05:32:00.000Z	Sasa	Chousuke	I have one ntfs partition and then 5gb of unpartitioned space. I want Ubuntu to install on the unpartitioned space. Which disk space option would be the best in my case?
2007-09-21T05:32:00.000Z	Chousuke	Sasa	use largest free space
2007-09-21T05:33:00.000Z	Chousuke	Sasa	it won't touch existing partitions
2007-09-21T05:33:00.000Z	Sasa	Chousuke	"use largest continuous free space" is the option?
2007-09-21T05:33:00.000Z	Chousuke	Sasa	yah
2007-09-21T05:33:00.000Z	Sasa	Chousuke	wish me luck, I'm about to install this puppy
2007-09-21T05:33:00.000Z	Chousuke	Sasa	heh
2007-09-21T05:34:00.000Z	Chousuke	Sasa	you can use ubuntu while it's installing
2007-09-21T05:34:00.000Z	Chousuke	Sasa	so come online and ask for instructions
2007-09-21T05:34:00.000Z	Chousuke	Sasa	unless you're already usign the live cd :D
2007-09-21T05:34:00.000Z	Sasa	Chousuke	thank you...I'm on live cd and the thing seems to be starting to install
2007-09-21T05:34:00.000Z	Chousuke	Sasa	heh
2007-09-21T05:35:00.000Z	Chousuke	Sasa	anyway, your ntfs partition should be safe.
2007-09-21T05:35:00.000Z	Chousuke	Sasa	the installer won't do anything to it unless you tell it to
2007-09-21T05:35:00.000Z	Sasa	Chousuke	thank you...I spent 5 hours getting the ntfs all set...see, i'm trying to create an image of my laptop with both xp and ubuntu on it...that way I don't have to worry I'll spend countless hours installing windows drivers....I can just reimage the computer in an hour and start all fresh
2007-09-21T05:36:00.000Z	Chousuke	Sasa	heh
2007-09-21T05:36:00.000Z	Sasa	Chousuke	how long does it usually take to install ubuntu
2007-09-21T05:36:00.000Z	Chousuke	Sasa	depends
