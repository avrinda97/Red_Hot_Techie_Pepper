2007-04-05T11:46:00.000Z	foutrelis	bullgard4	It's just a normal .iso image (not an ubuntu cd image). I tried to extract its contents but then the crashes start coming. I tried restarting but just before it loads the upper-right section of my panels, it crashes :(
2007-04-05T11:48:00.000Z	bullgard4	foutrelis	Did you check that the CD which you used is burnt correctly? That is, does it not contain any errors on it? How did you prove that?
2007-04-05T11:49:00.000Z	foutrelis	bullgard4	Well.. I have used the same iso image before.. The problem is that I don't have a clue why my panels keep crashing :\
2007-04-05T11:51:00.000Z	foutrelis	bullgard4	Well.. I could wait for Feisty and then do a fresh installation, I guess. It's just strange that extracting an ISO could mess up gnome-panels. Anyway.. Thanks for your help :)
2007-04-05T11:56:00.000Z	bullgard4	foutrelis	I had no problems downloading the ISO image, burining a CDRom AND then installing Ubuntu 7.04. I did not read that others had difficulties with their panels when installing. So there is some probability that your ISO image is at fault in a section that influences the panels. Even now you could try to download another image and burn a new CD-ROM.
2007-04-05T11:57:00.000Z	foutrelis	bullgard4	It's not an Ubuntu CD image :P
2007-04-05T11:57:00.000Z	bullgard4	foutrelis	But what?
2007-04-05T11:57:00.000Z	foutrelis	bullgard4	Just an iso with some files that I tried to extract :
2007-04-05T11:58:00.000Z	bullgard4	foutrelis	Please describe your situation more carefully so that I will understand it. --  Are you using Ubuntu already?
2007-04-05T12:00:00.000Z	foutrelis	bullgard4	Sorry for my bad description. I have been using this ubuntu installation for a few days. I never had any problems. Today I copied over an .iso file from my windows partition, right clicked on it and chose "extract here" Just after I clicked it my panels crashed and keep crashing even after I have rebooted. :)
2007-04-05T12:04:00.000Z	bullgard4	foutrelis	Oh, this is quite different from what I considered before. Not Ubuntu is stupid but you have acted stupidly. I'm afraid you will need to repair your ubuntu carefully using the console. I hope that you can isolate the culprit. I am not knowledgeable enough to guide you through using IRC only.
2007-04-05T12:06:00.000Z	foutrelis	bullgard4	I am not sure what I did wrong. Anyway, I 'll wait for Feisty since it will be released in two weeks. Thank you very much for your time :)
2007-04-05T12:07:00.000Z	bullgard4	foutrelis	You should not have loaded that .iso image file from Windows and installing without carefully considering its function and possible side-effects.
2007-04-05T12:08:00.000Z	foutrelis	bullgard4	What? I just selected to extract it's files. I did not mount anything :(
2007-04-05T12:10:00.000Z	bullgard4	foutrelis	foutrelis I doubt a bit that you really only extracted them. If this is really the case, simply remove them, and your Ubuntu will be up and running as before.
2007-04-05T12:12:00.000Z	foutrelis	bullgard4	I am sure that's the only thing I did. And I also deleted them after the problem appeared. Well.. maybe this problem appearing has nothing to do with extracting that iso. I don't know. :)
2007-04-05T12:16:00.000Z	bullgard4	foutrelis	You probably did not remove all files. Or, rather more likely, in the mean time one of those files has changed other files in your panel system. -- So you can re-install your old Ubuntu. Upgrade it when Feisty has been announced to be stable.
2007-04-05T12:19:00.000Z	foutrelis	bullgard4	I created a folder on my Desktop, put the .iso file in there and selected "extract here". I think that's a valid way to extract an iso safely.
2007-04-05T12:20:00.000Z	foutrelis	bullgard4	You explanation of panel files getting messed up is logical too.
2007-04-05T12:22:00.000Z	bullgard4	foutrelis	Only if you can trust the primary .iso file. I guess in general you cannot trust Windows files in an Ubuntu environment. Windows files are not made to work properly in an Ubuntu environment.
