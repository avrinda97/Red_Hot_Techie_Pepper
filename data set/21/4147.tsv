2008-07-31T09:57:00.000Z	bderrly	kushalsejwal	terminal
2008-07-31T10:00:00.000Z	bderrly	kushalsejwal	is there any reason you want/need to do that?
2008-07-31T10:01:00.000Z	kushalsejwal	bderrly	I was reading a blog for increasing Ubuntu speed. it was written "Ubuntu comes with 6 ttys enabled. You usually don't need more than 1 tty at a time. To disable tty2 to tty6:"
2008-07-31T10:01:00.000Z	bderrly	kushalsejwal	you won't be speeding your system up by doing htat
2008-07-31T10:02:00.000Z	bderrly	kushalsejwal	no
2008-07-31T10:04:00.000Z	kushalsejwal	bderrly	I am having a very strange problem, pls go thru if you can help "Whenever, I am installing/downloading any software or even updating ubuntu "hardy" I cannot surf internet, not a single site opens, all my downloads in torrent or otherwise goes 0 kbps/s. And the moment the software is downloaded, internet start working again."
2008-07-31T10:06:00.000Z	bderrly	kushalsejwal	what connection speed do you have? sounds like you're maxing it out when updating
2008-07-31T10:07:00.000Z	kushalsejwal	bderrly	I have 200 + kbps speed
2008-07-31T10:08:00.000Z	bderrly	kushalsejwal	i'm not sure what to tell you, it sounds like a network issue more than anything
2008-07-31T10:10:00.000Z	bderrly	kushalsejwal	i'm not sure that that will get you anywhere ;)
2008-07-31T10:12:00.000Z	kushalsejwal	bderrly	then what can I do
2008-07-31T10:12:00.000Z	bderrly	kushalsejwal	did you see my last few messages to you?
2008-07-31T10:13:00.000Z	kushalsejwal	bderrly	yes i do
2008-07-31T10:15:00.000Z	bderrly	kushalsejwal	what have you tried to troubleshoot the issue?
2008-07-31T10:17:00.000Z	kushalsejwal	bderrly	What is network.dns.disableIPv6 ???? I have it value "True"???
2008-07-31T10:17:00.000Z	bderrly	kushalsejwal	it means don't use ipv6 for dns
2008-07-31T10:18:00.000Z	bderrly	kushalsejwal	shouldn't be a problem
2008-07-31T10:22:00.000Z	bderrly	kushalsejwal	maybe they're throttling you due to excessive torrent traffic?
2008-07-31T10:24:00.000Z	kushalsejwal	bderrly	I have downloaded more than 20 GB this month :D
2008-07-31T10:29:00.000Z	kushalsejwal	bderrly	thanks buddy, Have a nice day :)
