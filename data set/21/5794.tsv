2008-02-02T00:27:00.000Z	kapace		hello, i installed ubuntu on a secondary HD, and didn't install the bootloader, and i have winxp working, but not ubuntu
2008-02-02T00:28:00.000Z	kapace		how can i add ubuntu to boot.ini?
2008-02-02T00:28:00.000Z	kapace		i think
2008-02-02T00:28:00.000Z	kapace		whats wubi?
2008-02-02T00:28:00.000Z	kapace		yes
2008-02-02T00:29:00.000Z	kapace		i can't boot to it
2008-02-02T00:29:00.000Z	RequinB4	kapace	- try going to your system BIOS
2008-02-02T00:29:00.000Z	kapace		oo, so i should just run wubi?
2008-02-02T00:29:00.000Z	RequinB4		and making sure that it boots to ubuntu first
2008-02-02T00:29:00.000Z	kapace	RequinB4	why would i go there?
2008-02-02T00:29:00.000Z	kapace		yes
2008-02-02T00:30:00.000Z	RequinB4		(02:29:01 PM) kapace: i can't boot to it - meaning ubuntu or windows?
2008-02-02T00:30:00.000Z	kapace	RequinB4	i can't boot to ubuntu
2008-02-02T00:30:00.000Z	kapace		thus no grub
2008-02-02T00:30:00.000Z	RequinB4	kapace	where do you have ubuntu installed?
2008-02-02T00:30:00.000Z	kapace		so, i think if i install wubi, it will work?
2008-02-02T00:30:00.000Z	kapace		on another HD
2008-02-02T00:30:00.000Z	RequinB4	kapace	go to your system BIOS and set it so it boots to that HDD first
2008-02-02T00:30:00.000Z	kapace		during install i didn't select to install boot loader
2008-02-02T00:31:00.000Z	kapace	RequinB4	i don't have bootloader to my second HD with ubuntu
2008-02-02T00:31:00.000Z	RequinB4	kapace	ah
