2011-05-14T06:39:00.000Z	escott	zroysch	you let it run for a week?
2011-05-14T06:40:00.000Z	zroysch	escott	more like just havent really had the time to mess with it
2011-05-14T06:41:00.000Z	escott	zroysch	well i would switch to a console and stop your mysql service, and see what that does
2011-05-14T06:48:00.000Z	escott	zroysch	they might have but it might have failed
2011-08-06T22:07:00.000Z	escott	zroysch	it must be unmounted, but most fs can be resized easily. i would be more worried about resizing the partition itself
2011-08-06T22:26:00.000Z	zroysch	escott	what do you mean
2011-08-06T22:27:00.000Z	escott	zroysch	nmcli is network managers cli tool
2011-08-17T06:14:00.000Z	zroysch	escott	don't know what much of that meant
2011-08-17T06:06:00.000Z	escott	zroysch	use parted or install and use gdisk
2011-08-17T06:07:00.000Z	zroysch	escott	what
2011-08-17T06:08:00.000Z	escott	zroysch	it tells you not to use fdisk, so don't. and besides the partitions are different block sizes compare 1953513472 vs 1953514494
2011-08-17T06:09:00.000Z	escott	zroysch	but since you are using fdisk on a gpt disk those numbers are meaningless, as fdisk doesn't even know what the real partition table is
2011-08-17T06:10:00.000Z	escott	zroysch	cat /proc/partitions
2011-08-17T06:10:00.000Z	zroysch	escott	should i even be using this GPT? I did it mostly as an experiment
2011-08-17T06:11:00.000Z	escott	zroysch	you need to use gpt for disks larger than 2gb (or something around that). gpt has a number of advantages, but you do have to use the correct tools
2011-08-17T06:11:00.000Z	escott	zroysch	2tb not 2gb

2011-08-17T06:12:00.000Z	escott	zroysch	so there you can see sda1 is not the same size as sdb1 or your md array
2011-08-17T06:13:00.000Z	zroysch	escott	why is sda being made smaller? i even repartitioned it in gparted to maximum size. they are both the same make and model hard drive
2011-08-17T06:13:00.000Z	escott	zroysch	since sda is the same size as sdb your problem must be that you have a few spare blocks in sda that you aren't using. this could be because you aligned the blocks at a MB boundary, and using that additional space could break 4k alignment leading to lower performance. you should try and partition with the additional blocks and then check the alignment with parted before proceeding
2011-08-17T06:17:00.000Z	escott	zroysch	long and short you didn't do "exactly" the same thing with sda and sdb. (as an aside I would recommend buying different disks from different manufacturers, you don't want to find out that there is a design flaw in your array when they both die suddenly)
