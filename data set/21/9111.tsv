2005-12-13T09:28:00.000Z	frogzoo	Jowi	careful - not all DNS servers ping these days - best to test with nslookup
2005-12-13T09:28:00.000Z	Jowi	frogzoo	never had that problem :)
2006-01-10T06:44:00.000Z	Jowi	frogzoo	an error message would be useful
2006-01-10T06:47:00.000Z	Jowi	frogzoo	are you using a custom kernel?
2006-01-10T06:48:00.000Z	frogzoo	Jowi	nope stock 686 - & I've tried the stock 386 too - I think something I installed has munged the init scripts, but dunno what
2006-01-10T06:50:00.000Z	Jowi	frogzoo	ok. is minix listed in /etc/modules? do you have a minix reference in /etc/fstab?
2006-01-10T06:50:00.000Z	frogzoo	Jowi	1/2 sec I'll check
2006-01-10T06:50:00.000Z	Jowi	frogzoo	also look for minix in /boot/grub/menu.lst
2006-01-10T06:52:00.000Z	Jowi	frogzoo	Pygi: could it be the initrd that is messed up?
2006-01-10T06:53:00.000Z	frogzoo	Jowi	I've tried 2 kernels, so I guess init is good
2006-01-10T06:53:00.000Z	Jowi	frogzoo	do both of them use the same initrd?
2006-01-10T06:54:00.000Z	frogzoo	Jowi	I though init was part of the kernel?
2006-01-10T06:54:00.000Z	Jowi	frogzoo	initrd loads modules into RAM before the real kernel takes over i think
2006-01-10T06:55:00.000Z	frogzoo	Jowi	yep, but that's part of /boot/initrd.img - -so it's different with each kernel
2006-01-10T06:56:00.000Z	Jowi	frogzoo	you got a kernel.stable option in grub to choose?
2006-01-10T06:57:00.000Z	frogzoo	Jowi	pretty sure it's not a kernel prob - because I have 2 different kernels - both crap out somewhere in /scripts/local-mounts
2006-01-10T06:57:00.000Z	Jowi	frogzoo	ok. hmm
2006-01-10T06:58:00.000Z	Jowi	frogzoo	so have a look at the scrips in /etc/init.d if you got a minix script in there, remove its executable bit.
2006-01-10T06:59:00.000Z	frogzoo	Jowi	yar, I think I just need to poke around a bit - thx for the help guys :)
2006-01-10T06:59:00.000Z	Jowi	frogzoo	np
2007-01-19T16:36:00.000Z	Jowi	frogzoo	atm eyalw doesn't even have Direct rendering enabled for his card...
