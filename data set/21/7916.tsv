2006-09-20T16:34:00.000Z	handless		got a question for everyone, i am trying to install but the problem as soon as i put the disk in and boot up it comes up the menu no problem and select the first option and its says loading at the top of the screen in red and never leaves that screen i left it there all night and it never left
2006-09-20T16:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	handless	Did you have the cd do a self check for errors
2006-09-20T16:35:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	handless	when you boot you come to a menu srtart or install ubuntu?
2006-09-20T16:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	handless	There is an option to test the cd for errors...
2006-09-20T16:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	handless	Have you selected that option and looked for any problems
2006-09-20T16:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	handless	Then you have a bad cd... how did you burn it.
2006-09-20T16:38:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	handless	windows or ?  I suggest burning at a slow speed..  I also suggest a program called isorecorder (free) for use in XP
2006-09-20T16:38:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	handless	But what spped did you burn it at?
2006-09-20T16:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	handless	I assume you verified the md5 from your comment earlier
2006-09-20T16:40:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	handless	Slow the burner down as low as possible... Until you get a good burned copy, there isnt much you can do..  And do the self test..
2006-09-20T16:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	handless	are you running sp1 or sp2
2006-09-20T16:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	handless	dl isorecorder for sp2
2006-09-20T16:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	handless	Sorry, for the lag, I had to take a call.  I dont think that is the program they suggest on the wiki site.  I know from personal experience isorecorder works well on most machines
2006-09-20T16:46:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	handless	Just burn the cd way slow and verify it...
2006-09-20T16:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	handless	i386
2006-09-20T06:05:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	handless	Does the self test for errors go through ok?
2006-09-20T06:06:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	handless	There are some commands you can try (F6) at the first menu   Grub Boot Options ide=nodma vga=normal nomce acpi=off acpi = no pnpbios=off xdrvr=vesa xres=800x600 apm=off
2006-09-20T07:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	handless	Glad you got that far...
2006-09-20T07:15:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	handless	Plenty of people to help...  I just had 2 seconds waiting for the wife...
