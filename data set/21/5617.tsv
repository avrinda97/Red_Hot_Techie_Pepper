2008-01-08T02:22:00.000Z	dbmoodb		hello looking for the effecty thing - used to be in compiz and beryl i think - where you move the mouse to one side and you see the windows all lined up
2008-01-08T02:23:00.000Z	dbmoodb		!ubuntu
2008-01-08T02:23:00.000Z	dbmoodb		!debian owns you all (ubuntu comes from debian via freedom)
2008-01-08T02:24:00.000Z	dbmoodb		:()
2008-01-08T02:24:00.000Z	dbmoodb		i know dark

2008-01-08T02:24:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dbmoodb	Please behave.  Ubuntu has done more for Debian and linux than the other way around
2008-01-08T02:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dbmoodb	You are being disruptive.. Please leave.
2008-01-29T04:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dbmoodb	Please take the discussion to !ot
2008-01-29T04:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dbmoodb	Yes it works with nvidia, I do need to use F6 and noapic or another modifier more than I would like
2008-06-04T19:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dbmoodb	Please stop
2008-06-04T19:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dbmoodb	This is not a discussion channel.. it is support.. If you have a valid support question please ask..
2008-06-04T19:58:00.000Z	dbmoodb	Jack_Sparrow	no i think we need to test how 16X pci express nvidia cards work with ubuntu -- for research of course we need to see how they scale
2008-06-04T19:59:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dbmoodb	So you dont think it is worth the time to boot a live cd to see if anything changes..
2008-06-04T19:59:00.000Z	dbmoodb	Jack_Sparrow	perhaps ---> get a 3rd opinion (go for it can't hurt)
2008-06-08T08:16:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dbmoodb	handled
2008-06-08T18:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dbmoodb	Dont use wtx in here.. keep it family friendly
2008-06-08T18:44:00.000Z	dbmoodb	Jack_Sparrow	maybe you know who thought it was a good idea to reboot a computer upon going killall -u username goes here
2008-06-08T18:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	dbmoodb	DOnt know where you got that info .. so no I dont know
2008-06-08T18:45:00.000Z	dbmoodb	Jack_Sparrow	it just happened to me
