2005-09-29T14:07:00.000Z	j-linux		I thought that apt-get install msttcorefonts would work, but it doesn't and MS site says they are no longer available?
2005-09-29T14:08:00.000Z	j-linux		Is there another way to get the fonts easily?
2005-09-29T14:09:00.000Z	zorba64	j-linux	they work for me - there are in multiverse
2005-09-29T14:10:00.000Z	j-linux	zorba64	oh.. I thought they were supposed to be in Universe.  Multiverse is different?
2005-09-29T14:11:00.000Z	zorba64	j-linux	just put multiverse after ant lines that have universe in them in your /etc/apt/sources.list
2005-09-29T14:13:00.000Z	j-linux	zorba64	"ant lines" ?
2005-09-29T14:13:00.000Z	zorba64	j-linux	any lines
2005-09-29T14:16:00.000Z	j-linux	zorba64	how do I find out the URL of multiverse? (sorry, I've never done this)
2005-09-29T14:17:00.000Z	zorba64	j-linux	any line that has universe in it, just type multiverse on that line after it
2005-09-29T14:18:00.000Z	zorba64	j-linux	eg deb http://au.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu breezy universe multiverse is a line from mine
2005-09-29T14:18:00.000Z	j-linux	zorba64	ok, thanks.  I'll try it.  Just "multiverse" on a line after any URL with "universe"
2005-09-29T14:18:00.000Z	j-linux	zorba64	so you mean copy the same URL format but substitute the word "multiverse"?
2005-09-30T05:39:00.000Z	zorba64	j-linux	did you remove the # from in front of those lines??
2005-09-30T05:40:00.000Z	j-linux	zorba64	 I have one line from Universe uncommented.  The other one is still commented.  Should they both be uncommented?
2005-09-30T05:40:00.000Z	zorba64	j-linux	you dont need the deb-src lines, leave them commented
2005-09-30T05:42:00.000Z	zorba64	j-linux	after amending, run : sudo apt-get update, then try for the software you want
2005-09-30T05:42:00.000Z	j-linux	zorba64	just add "multiverse" directly after the word "universe" right?
2005-09-30T05:42:00.000Z	zorba64	j-linux	yup
2005-09-30T05:42:00.000Z	j-linux	zorba64	ok... I'll try it again now. thanks.
2005-09-30T05:47:00.000Z	j-linux	zorba64	It worked this time.  I think last time I forgot the sudo apt-get update part and that is why it didn't work
2005-09-30T05:48:00.000Z	zorba64	j-linux	np
