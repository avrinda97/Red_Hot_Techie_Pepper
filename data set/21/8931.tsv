2005-12-15T07:01:00.000Z	augustin		hello
2005-12-15T07:02:00.000Z	augustin		is there any equivalent to MS "checkdisk" in Ubuntu ? for some reason, my Ubuntu doesn't want to mount drives... and the drive had been acting weird, making some noises and all. still, i can mount it (using a LiveCD)
2005-12-15T07:03:00.000Z	augustin		please, a simple answer =/ is there a checkdisk tool ?
2005-12-15T07:04:00.000Z	corresponder	augustin	fsck?!
2005-12-15T07:04:00.000Z	augustin	corresponder	i don't know, i'm quite new to ubuntu, and since the wiki couldn't help me, i come asking here
2005-12-15T07:05:00.000Z	augustin	corresponder	how do i use it please ?
2005-12-15T07:06:00.000Z	augustin	corresponder	only have one anyway
2005-12-15T07:09:00.000Z	augustin	corresponder	it says "clean", yet my Ubuntu cannot boot =/ i get the "console" graphics, then it starts "loading modules", and stops, and then it displays plenty of things, including /dev/hda1 could not be mounted, i think... what should i do ?
2005-12-15T07:09:00.000Z	augustin	corresponder	i'm sorry, maybe you're too busy to help, tell me so if it's the case...
2005-12-15T07:11:00.000Z	corresponder	augustin	what is on hda1?
2005-12-15T07:11:00.000Z	augustin	corresponder	yup, but then i don't understand why it won't boot =/
2005-12-15T07:11:00.000Z	augustin	corresponder	hda1 is my /, hda 2 is my XP partition, hda5 is my /boot, hda6 is the swap, hda7 is my /home
2005-12-15T07:12:00.000Z	corresponder	augustin	plenty of things is not close enough to help you
2005-12-15T07:13:00.000Z	augustin	corresponder	i can reboot to tell you more precisely
2005-12-15T07:13:00.000Z	augustin	corresponder	if there's nothing else i can do in the LiveCD, i'll reboot
2005-12-15T07:13:00.000Z	corresponder	augustin	maybe it would help
2005-12-15T07:13:00.000Z	augustin	corresponder	doing it right away then, thanks
2005-12-15T07:17:00.000Z	augustin	corresponder	does fsck do anything special ? like refreshing the MBR or something ? because now it boots just fine...
2005-12-15T07:17:00.000Z	augustin	corresponder	in any case, thanks a bunch for being patient with me =)
2005-12-15T07:18:00.000Z	augustin	corresponder	i swear it didn't boot
2005-12-15T07:20:00.000Z	augustin	corresponder	anyway, thanks again, good bye =)
