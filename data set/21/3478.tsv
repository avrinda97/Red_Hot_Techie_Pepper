2008-12-16T15:30:00.000Z	giganto	tiyowan_	the internal one doesn't work either
2008-12-16T15:31:00.000Z	tiyowan_	giganto	Does it detect the reader when you type "lsusb"?
2008-12-16T15:31:00.000Z	giganto	tiyowan_	seems like it did detect it
2008-12-16T15:32:00.000Z	tiyowan_	giganto	Ok...

2008-12-16T15:35:00.000Z	tiyowan_	giganto	I don't think it's picking up your reader. Olympus is your mouse right?
2008-12-16T15:35:00.000Z	giganto	tiyowan_	i don't have a mouse attached. Its an olympus card reader
2008-12-16T15:36:00.000Z	tiyowan_	giganto	Oops. :-) Sorry. Okay are you using 8.10?

2008-12-16T15:36:00.000Z	tiyowan_	giganto	So when you put in the card. Nothing happens? I mean can you access it?
2008-12-16T15:38:00.000Z	giganto	tiyowan_	umm, the light on the reader blinked furiously, then stopped. Then the option "USB Drive" appeared. I can't access it
