2009-02-05T14:24:00.000Z	Bobblybook		can anyone help me with getting an intel wireless card connecting to a network?
2009-02-05T14:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip2	Bobblybook	lspci will identify it, you can websearch from there

2009-02-05T14:29:00.000Z	Bobblybook	ActionParsnip2	thanks, but that doesn't really help - I have no conflict on eth1, I'm just worried it's not being detected as wireless properly..
2009-02-05T14:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip2	Bobblybook	it will help you rename it to wlan0
2009-02-05T14:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip2	Bobblybook	i think (as you say) it doesnt matter
2009-02-05T14:31:00.000Z	Bobblybook	ActionParsnip2	hmm Ok. iwconfig shows "unassociated" under access point. I think that might be the problem
2009-02-05T14:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip2	Bobblybook	you could try manually populating /etc/network/interfaces to test
2009-02-05T14:33:00.000Z	Bobblybook	ActionParsnip2	I will try that, brb a couple of mins.
2009-02-05T14:39:00.000Z	Bobblybook	ActionParsnip2	just got told I don't have permission to edit interfaces
2009-02-05T14:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip2	Bobblybook	gksudo gedit /etc/network/interfaces
2009-02-05T14:40:00.000Z	Bobblybook	ActionParsnip2	thanks, all saved. Do I need to restart or reload ubuntu?
2009-02-05T14:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip2	Bobblybook	you need to run: sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
2009-02-05T14:44:00.000Z	Bobblybook	ActionParsnip2	All done, still nothing new though.
2009-02-05T15:09:00.000Z	Bobblybook	ActionParsnip2	Any ideas? I added the network in Network Connections -> Wireless, but no luck. Should it be finding the network automatically?
2009-02-05T15:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip2	Bobblybook	if you rename the interfaces file you editted and reboot you will have no network config which may help, you wil get a blank config which you can resetup
2009-02-05T15:15:00.000Z	Bobblybook	ActionParsnip2	Ok, how would I do that?
2009-02-05T15:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip2	Bobblybook	sudo mv /etc/network/interfaces /etc/network/interfaces_old
2009-02-05T15:17:00.000Z	Bobblybook	ActionParsnip2	Thanks, rebooting.
2009-02-05T15:21:00.000Z	Bobblybook	ActionParsnip2	OK, I have no interface file now, but my wired and wireless connections are still saved
2009-02-05T15:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip2	Bobblybook	ok now fire up your connection manager software and setup
