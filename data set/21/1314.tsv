2010-10-29T04:43:00.000Z	Jygga		from which version did you upgrade to which version?
2010-10-29T04:44:00.000Z	rb	Jygga	Tnx, which wiki exactly?  (10.04 to whatever was current the other day)
2010-10-29T04:44:00.000Z	Jygga		10.04 to 10.10 then
2010-10-29T04:45:00.000Z	rb	Jygga	10.10 then OK, so howzabout a wiki URL?
2010-10-29T04:46:00.000Z	rb		Jygga?
2010-10-29T04:47:00.000Z	Jygga	rb	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MaverickMeerkat/ReleaseNotes
2010-10-29T04:48:00.000Z	rb	Jygga	thanks!  IdleOne also tnx & see J.'s prev...
2010-10-29T04:59:00.000Z	rb	Jygga	IdleOne, I read the upgrade bugs list, (and a bug page) but it's not clear which of the various items apply to my Ubuntu 10.10 system problem of no network, any advice for narrowing it down?
2010-10-29T04:59:00.000Z	rb		s/it/the possibilities/
2010-10-29T05:00:00.000Z	Jygga	rb	what are the symptoms exactly?
2010-10-29T05:01:00.000Z	rb	Jygga	no network.  'ifconfig' gives a NIC address, but no IP address.
2010-10-29T05:02:00.000Z	Jygga		have you tried to manually set an ip matching your subnet?
2010-10-29T05:02:00.000Z	Jygga		or enable dhcp?
2010-10-29T05:03:00.000Z	rb	Jygga	I've tried restarting the 'networking' daemon, that didn't go.  Enabling 'dhcp' -- isn't it already enabled? I assume that's how it got an IP address from the router before the upgrade.  Manually, no.
2010-10-29T05:04:00.000Z	rb		Manually would be useful as a short term kludge though.  It's been so long since I've done it though, and my notes aren't nearby...
2010-10-29T05:10:00.000Z	rb		Jygga?
2010-10-29T05:11:00.000Z	Jygga		sry rb i could only guess, go google a bit and try stuff
2010-10-29T05:12:00.000Z	rb	Jygga	did that before IRC-ing.  Thanks for the assist though.  What a rough upgrade...
