2010-06-04T17:00:00.000Z	nyuszika7h		Help please! It's removing GNOME's things also!!!
2010-06-04T17:00:00.000Z	nyuszika7h		It removed xchat too... but I'm still there... on IRC...
2010-06-04T17:00:00.000Z	nyuszika7h		Or maybe that was KDE's xchat?
2010-06-04T17:00:00.000Z	nyuszika7h		Hey, the terminal is removing itself!
2010-06-04T17:00:00.000Z	nyuszika7h		'Removing gnome-terminal ...'
2010-06-04T17:01:00.000Z	nyuszika7h		The command I've copy-pasted have NOTHING about gnome in it
2010-06-04T17:01:00.000Z	Pici	nyuszika7h	Did you remove or install apt?
2010-06-04T17:03:00.000Z	Pici	nyuszika7h	Please do NOT do that again.
2010-06-04T17:03:00.000Z	Pici	nyuszika7h	Why did you do that?
2010-06-04T19:13:00.000Z	Pici	nyuszika7h	The browser's package name is chromium-browser
2011-04-07T19:30:00.000Z	Pici	nyuszika7h	yes, see the manpage, there are other 'fonts' that you can choose.
2011-04-07T19:35:00.000Z	nyuszika7h	Pici	And where are installed fonts located?
2011-04-07T19:36:00.000Z	Pici	nyuszika7h	/usr/share/figlet/ , you don't need to provide the full path though,just the font name.
2011-04-07T19:37:00.000Z	Pici	nyuszika7h	you may also want to look at the toilet package, I think it has other 'fonts' available, with similar behavior as figlet.
2011-04-07T19:39:00.000Z	nyuszika7h	Pici	I get "Unable to open font file"
2011-04-07T19:39:00.000Z	Pici	nyuszika7h	What are you typing?
2011-07-19T22:38:00.000Z	nyuszika7h	Pici	it's vim.tiny iirc
2011-07-19T22:38:00.000Z	Pici	nyuszika7h	yes, the package name is vim-tiny.
2011-07-20T00:11:00.000Z	Pici	nyuszika7h	thats not a frontent for mplayer.
2012-05-15T20:16:00.000Z	Pici	nyuszika7h	you can recreate it with mknod, let me get you the options.
2012-05-15T20:16:00.000Z	Pici	nyuszika7h	so, chmod a+w /dev/null
