2005-06-27T14:59:00.000Z	Seveas	roger__	can you paste your /boot/grub/menu.lst and the output of sudo fdisk -l on paste.ubuntulinux.nl please
2005-06-27T15:01:00.000Z	roger__	Seveas	it's up
2005-06-27T15:02:00.000Z	Seveas	roger__	root (hd3,0) doesn't seem to be correct
2005-06-27T15:02:00.000Z	Seveas	roger__	given that windows is on (hd0,1)
2005-06-27T15:03:00.000Z	Seveas	roger__	can you please post your *complete* menu.lst too
2005-06-27T15:03:00.000Z	roger__	Seveas	it is, I just cropped the output from fdisk
2005-06-27T15:03:00.000Z	roger__	Seveas	ok will put the whole lot up.. just a min
2005-06-27T15:04:00.000Z	Seveas	roger__	put the complete output of fdisk too then
2005-06-27T15:06:00.000Z	roger__	Seveas	full listing is up - hda and hdb are old disks from previous installation, don't have any OS files on them
2005-06-27T15:07:00.000Z	roger__	Seveas	just noticed the Windows partition has the bootable flag and not my /boot partition (sda4) - could that be the problem do you think?
2005-06-27T15:07:00.000Z	Seveas	roger__	no
2005-06-27T15:08:00.000Z	Seveas	roger__	"Partition table entries are not in disk order"
2005-06-27T15:08:00.000Z	Seveas	roger__	by the way, does windows think it is installed on C:\
2005-06-27T15:09:00.000Z	roger__	Seveas	yeah, it can't see any other partitions (they're all non-Windows)
2005-06-27T15:09:00.000Z	Seveas	roger__	try hide (hd0) and hide (hd1) in grub
2005-06-27T15:10:00.000Z	roger__	Seveas	just at the top of the file?
2005-06-27T15:10:00.000Z	Seveas	roger__	no, just before the boot in the winxp entry
2005-06-27T15:10:00.000Z	roger__	Seveas	thanks will give it a shot ;)
2005-06-27T15:11:00.000Z	Seveas	roger__	while you're at it:
2005-06-27T15:23:00.000Z	roger__	Seveas	tried the hide (hdx) thing and it doesn't work - infact now grub just says "error 17" and doesn't even bring up the menu :)
2005-06-27T15:24:00.000Z	Seveas	roger__	ouch :|
