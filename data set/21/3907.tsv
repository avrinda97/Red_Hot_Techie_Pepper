2008-09-23T15:23:00.000Z	bullgard4		Why does  "Search for Files" not find 'places.sqlite' although locate finds 3 files? "Search for Files" searches the whole file system.
2008-09-23T15:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	bullgard4	maybe its some option. I always use find in command line
2008-09-23T15:30:00.000Z	bullgard4	ActionParsnip1	Yes, may be it is an option. Sorry that you did not tell me which one. I have tried them all.

2008-10-14T19:20:00.000Z	bullgard4	ActionParsnip1	Before I posted here, I already read 'man paplay'. So what?
2008-10-14T19:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	bullgard4	just verifying what you say
2008-11-07T17:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	bullgard4	maybe old school works..try ctrl + insert
2008-11-07T17:42:00.000Z	bullgard4	ActionParsnip1	Ctrl+Ins does not work. But earthnative's proposal works.
2008-11-07T17:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	bullgard4	just testing. ive tried to find the shortcut myself but then have to move my hand off keyboard to get copy
2008-11-07T17:45:00.000Z	bullgard4	ActionParsnip1	I am not quite sure what you were going to tell me. I have left my hands off the keyboard in order to get the string copied. And this works.
2008-11-07T17:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	bullgard4	im just saying how it sucks theres no copy shortcut
2008-11-07T17:47:00.000Z	bullgard4	ActionParsnip1	Ok.
