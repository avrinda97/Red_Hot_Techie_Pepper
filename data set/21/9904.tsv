2008-06-29T14:34:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	fma243	  ya could make that module auto load.. or put the command in /etc/rc.local
2008-06-29T14:34:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	fma243	 edit /etc/rc.local and put the command befor the 'exit' command.
2008-06-29T14:36:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	fma243	 or add the module name to # /etc/modules
2008-06-29T14:45:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	fma243	 how many times ya going to reread the same factoid?
2008-06-29T14:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	fma243	 you said it worked when youloaded that module.. so  was it not totally working?
2008-06-29T14:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	fma243	 you need to edit it as root since its a system file
2008-06-29T14:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	fma243	 sudo nano /etc/whatever
2008-06-29T14:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	fma243	then you got deeper issues it seems then sound.
2008-06-29T14:49:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	fma243	 'sudo nano /etc/modules'  is   the whole command.
2008-06-29T14:50:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	fma243	 editing of /etc/modules may be easier and more proper.. but do what you want.
2008-06-29T14:50:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	fma243	 either one will work
2008-06-29T14:57:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	fma243	 just the name of the module. so 'snd-sb16'
2008-06-29T19:53:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	fma243	 thats because they are not being mounted untill you access them the first time.
