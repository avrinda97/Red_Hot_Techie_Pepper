2006-06-19T09:36:00.000Z	pngwen		grrrrr.... apt-get keeps saying that the package is not installed when I try to rmove it, aptitude gives no output, and dpkg still lists it.  I can't reinstall it
2006-06-19T09:36:00.000Z	pngwen		because when I do it tries to "reconfigure" a non-installed package.  Is there some way to make it wiseup?
2006-06-19T09:38:00.000Z	pngwen		is there anyway to fix a messed up package database?  if so how?  exim4 won't reinstall because it errantly believes it is still installed.  The packages list in dpkg, but apt-get deson't think they are there and aptitude is useless.
2006-06-19T09:38:00.000Z	pngwen		do i have to reinstall because of a botched install of exim4?
2006-06-19T09:39:00.000Z	pngwen		how can I force aptitude to not try to reconfigure (but rather reinstall) a package it half way belives is there?
2006-06-19T09:40:00.000Z	Ng	pngwen	first things first, try a "sudo dpkg -P exim4"
2006-06-19T09:40:00.000Z	Ng	pngwen	copy your config files first if you need them
2006-06-19T09:40:00.000Z	Ng	pngwen	that should completely vape exim from your system
2006-06-19T09:40:00.000Z	pngwen	Ng	I get "Ignoring request to remove exim4 which isn't installed"
2006-06-19T09:41:00.000Z	pngwen	Ng	yet when I go to install it, it fails.  and they still list in when I do a dpkg -l
2006-06-19T09:41:00.000Z	Ng	pngwen	ok, you could try "sudo dpkg -i /var/cache/apt/archives/exim-blahblah.deb"
2006-06-19T09:41:00.000Z	Ng	pngwen	that should reinstall the package
2006-06-19T09:42:00.000Z	pngwen	Ng	fails, reports errors about a missing /etc/exim4 directory
2006-06-19T09:43:00.000Z	Ng	pngwen	could you paste the errors to a pastebin?
2006-06-19T09:52:00.000Z	Ng	pngwen	did you manage to paste the errors to a pastebin?
2006-06-19T09:52:00.000Z	pngwen	Ng	yes.  http://pastebin.com/718597
2006-06-19T09:52:00.000Z	pngwen	Ng	and then cygwin flipped out and killed everything :-P
2006-06-19T09:54:00.000Z	Ng	pngwen	hmm, try "touch /etc/exim4/exim4.conf" and then another reinstall command
2006-06-19T09:55:00.000Z	pngwen	Ng	that kinda did it.  How can I force it to redo everything from scratch, right up to its config dialog and original config files?
2006-06-19T09:56:00.000Z	Ng	pngwen	you could remove all the packages and re-install them, or you can re-run the configure bits with "sudo dpkg-reconfigure exim4-config"
2006-06-19T09:57:00.000Z	pngwen	Ng	seems to be working now, but we'll see.
