2008-06-19T21:01:00.000Z	TuniX12	jc___	rm /var/cache/apt/archives/openoffice.org-core
2008-06-19T21:02:00.000Z	TuniX12	jc___	than sudo apt-get install openfoccice-core
2008-06-19T21:03:00.000Z	jc___	TuniX12	if I rm the cache will it let me get past the -f install thing?
2008-06-19T21:04:00.000Z	TuniX12	jc___	maybe try it remove the cached archive than force install
2008-06-19T21:10:00.000Z	jc___	TuniX12	how do I force the install
2008-06-19T21:13:00.000Z	TuniX12	jc___	-f install
2008-06-19T21:14:00.000Z	TuniX12	jc___	i suspect the archive integrity
2008-06-19T21:15:00.000Z	jc___	TuniX12	if its archive integrity redownloading should fix it right?
2008-06-19T21:16:00.000Z	TuniX12	jc___	maybe
2008-06-19T21:17:00.000Z	jc___	TuniX12	because I've tried to redownload the packages a couple of time and it always gives me the same errors when I try to do the install again
2008-06-19T21:17:00.000Z	TuniX12	jc___	sudo apt-get remove than update list and reinstall
2008-06-19T21:18:00.000Z	jc___	TuniX12	ok I'll try that
2008-06-19T21:18:00.000Z	TuniX12	jc___	dont forget autoremove
