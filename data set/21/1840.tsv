2011-10-14T08:14:00.000Z	zmbmartin	rabbi1	speaking of upgrading bios. Do you know how I can upgrade bios for my hp envy 17 without a windows environment?
2011-10-14T08:15:00.000Z	rabbi1	zmbmartin	never exp on hp. got to check their specific site for bios upgrade
2011-10-14T08:15:00.000Z	zmbmartin	rabbi1	yeah it says windows required. I tried a few things to know avail. Thanks anyways
2011-10-14T08:16:00.000Z	rabbi1	zmbmartin	then install windows, upgrade bios then install ubuntu
2011-10-14T08:17:00.000Z	zmbmartin	rabbi1	I don't want to loose my ubuntu install I got going. Doesn't windows want the whole hd.
2011-10-14T08:18:00.000Z	rabbi1	zmbmartin	nothing, just goahead and do it. it's always better to have your bios upgraded once in 2 years
2011-10-14T08:20:00.000Z	zmbmartin	rabbi1	so you are saying I can install windows without blowing up my ubuntu install?
2011-10-14T08:20:00.000Z	rabbi1	zmbmartin	yes, you will just blowup the boot config file, that you can reset it later
2011-10-14T08:21:00.000Z	zmbmartin	rabbi1	awesome I will work on that. Thanks
2011-10-14T08:21:00.000Z	rabbi1	zmbmartin	before doing so, just keep the solution ready to recover your grub....
2011-10-14T08:21:00.000Z	zmbmartin	rabbi1	I can do that from a ubuntu live usb right?
2011-10-14T08:22:00.000Z	rabbi1	zmbmartin	guess so. be prepared with all the situation..
2011-10-14T08:22:00.000Z	zmbmartin	rabbi1	Thanks
2011-10-14T08:23:00.000Z	rabbi1	zmbmartin	you won't loose anything other than grub, and depends on your FS/ Drive Structure... So i have no idea how is yours, need to understand your situation and you are the best person to judge that
2011-10-14T08:23:00.000Z	rabbi1	zmbmartin	conclusion is can be done.
2011-10-14T08:23:00.000Z	zmbmartin	rabbi1	Yeah I will take all that into consideration.
2011-10-14T08:53:00.000Z	zmbmartin	rabbi1	do you know if I could make or get a windows live cd and upgrade my bios from that?
2011-10-14T08:53:00.000Z	rabbi1	zmbmartin	sorry, no idea
2011-10-14T08:54:00.000Z	rabbi1	zmbmartin	i don't think windows gives you that kind of option like ubuntu, check out the new 7 and 8. if you have any with you.
