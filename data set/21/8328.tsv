2011-05-22T12:51:00.000Z	coz_	windowsuser	 oh  4 am here ;)
2011-05-22T12:49:00.000Z	coz_	windowsuser	 if you dont have a cd or flash driver I cant think of any way of doing this,, evern the mini .iso at 19 megs requires either of those
2011-05-22T12:49:00.000Z	coz_	windowsuser	 do you have a burner but no cd to buren ...yes?
2011-05-22T12:49:00.000Z	coz_	windowsuser	 ubuntu 5.xx  yikes
2011-05-22T12:50:00.000Z	coz_	windowsuser	 you cannot burn or you just dont have a cd to burn onto ?
2011-05-22T12:50:00.000Z	coz_	windowsuser	 no rewriteable layting around somewhere?
2011-05-22T12:51:00.000Z	coz_	windowsuser	  if you find one just use the mini iso ,,
2011-05-22T12:51:00.000Z	coz_	windowsuser	   https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
2011-05-22T12:52:00.000Z	coz_	windowsuser	  I cant think of any way off hand to use that iso while on windows to install ubuntu over top of windows :(
2011-05-22T12:53:00.000Z	coz_	windowsuser	 that I dont know,, I have 0 experience with wubi
2011-05-22T13:01:00.000Z	coz_	windowsuser	 mm maybe some of these suggestioins would work better with mini.iso , it is put into memory and as far I have tested the cd is no longer required after the intial install begins
