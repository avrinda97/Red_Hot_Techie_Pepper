2010-10-10T16:25:00.000Z	NickyJ101	dwarder	yes Maverick Meerkat final release was launched today, your ubuntu updater should get it
2010-10-10T16:26:00.000Z	NickyJ101	dwarder	tell me what method you want and I'll help you through it, not hard
2010-10-10T16:26:00.000Z	dwarder	NickyJ101	where can i see changelog?
2010-10-10T16:27:00.000Z	dwarder	NickyJ101	should i upgrade?
2010-10-10T16:27:00.000Z	NickyJ101	dwarder	depends, what version you on now?
2010-10-10T16:28:00.000Z	dwarder	NickyJ101	Linux Name 2.6.32-25-generic #44-Ubuntu SMP Fri Sep 17 20:26:08 UTC 2010 i686 GNU/Linux
2010-10-10T16:28:00.000Z	NickyJ101	dwarder	that the kernal, not the actual version. The new is 10.10, what is yours, 10.4
2010-10-10T16:29:00.000Z	dwarder	NickyJ101	You are using Ubuntu 10.04 LTS - the Lucid Lynx - released in April 2010 and supported until April 2013.
2010-10-10T16:30:00.000Z	NickyJ101	dwarder	yes, I do but what version are you on (updating later today to assist others with this)
2010-10-10T16:30:00.000Z	dwarder	NickyJ101	i copied this :)
2010-10-10T16:30:00.000Z	dwarder	NickyJ101	from my help
2010-10-10T16:30:00.000Z	dwarder	NickyJ101	so it is me :)
2010-10-10T16:31:00.000Z	NickyJ101	dwarder	oh right.... ok see. You can update, but 10.04 supports updates for a lot longer, if you get 10.10 you will need to do an update every so often, but update is worth it. Much more efficient
2010-10-10T16:32:00.000Z	dwarder	NickyJ101	so i just run updater and that's all?
2010-10-10T16:33:00.000Z	NickyJ101	dwarder	that's the theory, if it sees it then easy, let me know if for whatever reason it doesn't give you that option
2010-10-10T16:34:00.000Z	NickyJ101	dwarder	did it work?
2010-10-10T16:34:00.000Z	dwarder	NickyJ101	thank you
2010-10-10T16:34:00.000Z	NickyJ101	dwarder	ok, happy meekat
