2007-02-23T11:52:00.000Z	davidwinter		is there a way I can install Ubuntu via Windows via the hdd?
2007-02-23T11:52:00.000Z	davidwinter		ie... I can't find a way to boot via CD
2007-02-23T11:52:00.000Z	davidwinter		and I don't have a floppy
2007-02-23T11:53:00.000Z	riotkittie	davidwinter	admin pass in BIOS?
2007-02-23T11:53:00.000Z	davidwinter	riotkittie	Admin password for a Dell, yes
2007-02-23T11:54:00.000Z	riotkittie	davidwinter	 is it /your/ computer?
2007-02-23T11:54:00.000Z	davidwinter	riotkittie	off of Ebay
2007-02-23T11:55:00.000Z	riotkittie	davidwinter	yay for ebayed dells. i have an ancient one myself. look into removing the CMOS battery - google and decide if its something you care to undertake
2007-02-23T11:55:00.000Z	riotkittie	davidwinter	taking that battery out for about a min will reset BIOS to the default and remove the password
2007-02-23T11:55:00.000Z	davidwinter	riotkittie	ok, I'll try and find the battery :/
2007-02-23T11:57:00.000Z	riotkittie	davidwinter	do you not get a message at the BIOS screen that gives you an option for both entering BIOS setup and alternately, using a 1 time boot menu?
2007-02-23T11:57:00.000Z	davidwinter	riotkittie	just F2 to enter setup
2007-02-23T11:57:00.000Z	davidwinter	riotkittie	is that what you mean?
2007-02-23T11:58:00.000Z	riotkittie	davidwinter	ew. no. when i boot, i can either press f2 to enter bios, or f12 to get a boot menu that lets me select between hd, cd, floppy, and cardbus nic
2007-02-23T11:59:00.000Z	davidwinter	riotkittie	don't get that option.
2007-02-23T11:59:00.000Z	riotkittie	davidwinter	alternately, have you considered contacting the person who sold it and asking them? might be easier.
2007-02-23T12:00:00.000Z	davidwinter	riotkittie	already tried, no luck
2007-02-23T12:01:00.000Z	riotkittie	davidwinter	good luck with the battery thing then. from what i understand, it isnt difficult at all but i've never had need to try it myself.
2007-02-23T12:01:00.000Z	davidwinter	riotkittie	just going to unscrew the thing now and look for it
2007-02-23T12:02:00.000Z	riotkittie	davidwinter	service tag should be on the underside of the laptop.  worth a shot.
2007-02-23T12:06:00.000Z	riotkittie	davidwinter	sounds like someone sold you a stolen laptop. heh. :/ uhm, try googling +"dell your-model-# here" +"service tag"
