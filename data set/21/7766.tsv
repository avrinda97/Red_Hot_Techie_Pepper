2006-10-25T10:09:00.000Z	dabaR	corevette	keep in mind you are in #ubuntu:)
2006-11-25T12:07:00.000Z	dabaR	corevette	x not starting often
2006-12-07T12:36:00.000Z	dabaR	corevette	what do you mean you can not see it?
2006-12-07T12:37:00.000Z	dabaR	corevette	cause it has a .xhtml extension and your browser displays those as not-web-pages.
2006-12-07T12:38:00.000Z	corevette	dabaR	i've tried firefox/knoqueror/opera
2006-12-07T12:39:00.000Z	dabaR	corevette	is this your file?
2006-12-07T12:40:00.000Z	dabaR	corevette	rename it to .html
2006-12-07T12:41:00.000Z	dabaR	corevette	you want what xhtml? xhtml files have html extensions.
2006-12-07T12:42:00.000Z	dabaR	corevette	why would you want that extension rather than html? your server likely sends a header to the browser that makes the browser interpret it as xml rather than html...
2007-02-16T11:05:00.000Z	dabaR	corevette	show us the output of ls in a paste.ubuntu-nl.org post.
2007-02-16T11:04:00.000Z	dabaR	corevette	did you run ./configure?
2007-02-16T11:06:00.000Z	dabaR	corevette	and make does not work?
2007-02-16T11:08:00.000Z	dabaR	corevette	where did you get the file?
2007-02-16T11:11:00.000Z	dabaR	corevette	I need a few.
2007-02-16T11:16:00.000Z	dabaR	corevette	try following this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=96506
2007-02-16T11:20:00.000Z	dabaR	corevette	do you have build-essential installed?
2007-02-16T11:25:00.000Z	dabaR	corevette	I was on the phone with a friend, I will look now.
2007-02-16T11:29:00.000Z	dabaR	corevette	you are sure that supports your card?
2007-02-16T11:35:00.000Z	dabaR	corevette	you followed the forum howto?
2007-02-16T11:45:00.000Z	dabaR	corevette	I can only suggest perhaps posting to the forum thread, with as much info on your issue that you have. Like exact steps, exact hardware, exact output, and someone may apply,. The thread was active a week ago last time.
