2005-11-15T15:50:00.000Z	recon		well, when i run 'java' in a terminal, it runs gij instead.
2005-11-15T15:50:00.000Z	theine	recon	update-alternatives --display java
2005-11-15T15:51:00.000Z	theine	recon	try that and see if the sun version shows up
2005-11-15T15:52:00.000Z	theine	recon	how did you install sun java?
2005-11-15T15:53:00.000Z	theine	recon	that's not optimal, try the one from http://seveas.ubuntulinux.nl
2005-11-15T15:53:00.000Z	theine	recon	he has a java repo with j2re 1.5
2005-11-15T15:55:00.000Z	theine	recon	oh...
2005-11-15T15:55:00.000Z	theine	recon	http://seveas.ubuntulinux.nl/
2005-11-15T15:56:00.000Z	theine	recon	you would need to add the repository to /etc/apt/sources.list, but you can also just wget the .deb package and install with dpkg...
2005-11-15T15:57:00.000Z	theine	recon	wget http://seveas.ubuntulinux.nl//pool/java/sun-j2re1.5_1.5.0+update05_i386.deb
2005-11-15T15:57:00.000Z	theine	recon	does that work?
2005-11-15T15:58:00.000Z	theine	recon	hmmm, maybe his repository is down...
2005-11-15T15:58:00.000Z	theine	recon	yes, it seems so
2005-11-15T15:59:00.000Z	theine	recon	it's too big i'm afraid
2005-11-15T16:00:00.000Z	theine	recon	you should definately use java-package instead of alien though
2005-11-15T16:00:00.000Z	recon	theine	???
