2010-10-09T18:49:00.000Z	HaPK_PerCar		I was wondering... When the next version of ubuntu comes out I'm going to reinstall rather that update. Do I loose all the configuration I've done previously if I do that?
2010-10-09T18:51:00.000Z	HaPK_PerCar		can someone confirm this? do I loose every file if I reinstall?
2010-10-09T18:51:00.000Z	HaPK_PerCar		I mean, every file in my ubuntu partition
2010-10-09T18:51:00.000Z	coz_	HaPK_PerCar	 if you reinstall over an existing install..yes you lose it all
2010-10-09T18:52:00.000Z	HaPK_PerCar	coz_	hm, I see...
2010-10-09T18:52:00.000Z	HaPK_PerCar		oh well, no other thing to do that upgrade then...
2010-10-09T18:52:00.000Z	coz_	HaPK_PerCar	  you need to back up to cd or external drive ...everything you want to save
2010-10-09T18:52:00.000Z	coz_	HaPK_PerCar	  are these files  or applications you want to save?
2010-10-09T18:53:00.000Z	coz_	HaPK_PerCar	  do you have dropbox installed? it has 2gigs of free storage and well worth the effort
2010-10-09T18:53:00.000Z	HaPK_PerCar	coz_	yeah, quite a bit of work in there
2010-10-09T18:53:00.000Z	coz_	HaPK_PerCar	 does it exceed 2 gigs?
2010-10-09T18:54:00.000Z	HaPK_PerCar	coz_	hmmm, I don't think so, but it takes a lot of time to upload things to the dropbox cloud
2010-10-09T18:54:00.000Z	coz_	HaPK_PerCar	 well not too much time considering that it will be safe and reinstalltion can be done without concern
2010-10-09T18:55:00.000Z	HaPK_PerCar	coz_	and what about programs and other configs? I loose all those too?
2010-10-09T18:55:00.000Z	coz_	HaPK_PerCar	 for programs you can use aptoncd
2010-10-09T18:56:00.000Z	coz_	HaPK_PerCar	 that will essentially back up the applications that you are using at the moment and reinstall them later
2010-10-09T18:56:00.000Z	HaPK_PerCar	coz_	I'll see that
2010-10-09T18:57:00.000Z	coz_	HaPK_PerCar	 both dropbox and aptoncd may be your saving grace ... this way you can reinstalll at any given time knowing that these things are safely backed up
2010-10-09T18:58:00.000Z	HaPK_PerCar	coz_	I have an NTFS partition, so I guess I can backup all my important files there. aptoncd seems useful
2010-10-09T18:58:00.000Z	HaPK_PerCar	coz_	thanks for the help
2010-10-09T18:59:00.000Z	coz_	HaPK_PerCar	 yes that is the other option for sure...I sometimes do that on the windows partition
