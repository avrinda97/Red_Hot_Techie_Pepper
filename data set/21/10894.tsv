2004-10-17T06:29:00.000Z	lothario		dmesg tells me there's an I/O error
2004-10-17T06:29:00.000Z	lothario		among other stuff
2004-10-17T06:30:00.000Z	Treenaks	lothario	have you tried booting with acpi=off, pci=noacpi, noapic and/or nolapic kernel options?
2004-10-17T06:31:00.000Z	lothario	Treenaks	I've tried none of the above, I don't know how to set such variables ;(
2004-10-17T06:32:00.000Z	Treenaks	lothario	reboot, press ESC to open the bootloader menu, press "e" to edit, and add these options
2004-10-17T06:34:00.000Z	lothario	Treenaks	should I do all four options at one time, or should I try one at a time?
2004-10-17T06:34:00.000Z	Treenaks	lothario	try all four first, then remove one at a time, until it breaks again, then try with only the option that -- if removed -- "breaks" it
2004-10-17T06:35:00.000Z	Treenaks	lothario	or, try one at a time, and if one doesn't work, try combinations
2004-10-17T06:35:00.000Z	Treenaks	lothario	and work up
2004-10-17T06:36:00.000Z	lothario	Treenaks	thanks, time to reboot.
2004-10-17T06:36:00.000Z	Treenaks	lothario	good luck
2004-10-17T06:42:00.000Z	lothario	Treenaks	I'm at the edit screen in bootloader, I don't know where to enter those options you suggested..
2004-10-17T06:44:00.000Z	Treenaks	lothario	go to the "kernel" line (which also has "root=" in it somehwere I guess)
2004-10-17T06:44:00.000Z	Treenaks	lothario	then press "e" to edit the line (there's help at the bottom of the screen)
2004-10-17T06:44:00.000Z	Treenaks	lothario	then add the options to the line, press ENTER to finalize, then press "b" to boot it
2004-10-17T06:46:00.000Z	lothario	Treenaks	thanks
2004-10-17T07:20:00.000Z	Treenaks	lothario	what does the last line in  dmesg | tail say
2004-10-17T07:22:00.000Z	lothario	Treenaks	usb 2-2.2:USB disconnect, address 68
2004-10-17T07:22:00.000Z	Treenaks	lothario	did you do the acpi=off stuff
2004-10-17T07:23:00.000Z	lothario	Treenaks	I did all four options and the symptoms were the similar, 
2004-10-17T07:28:00.000Z	lothario	Treenaks	actually here's the tail line of dmesg
