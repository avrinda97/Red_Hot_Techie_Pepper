2011-04-30T01:57:00.000Z	trae		odd...  so on Unity I have to have an icon ON the desktop as well as ON the launcher?  that's ridiculous.
2011-04-30T01:58:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	trae	Why do you say that?  You only need icons on the launcher if that's all you want,
2011-04-30T01:59:00.000Z	trae	FunnyLookinHat	how can I add a launcher to the panel in unity WITHOUT adding it to the desktop first.  And, giving it a custom icon on the panel.
2011-04-30T01:59:00.000Z	trae	FunnyLookinHat	cause when I remove it from the desktop, it goes away from the panel.
2011-04-30T01:59:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	trae	Click the ubuntu icon in the top left, search for your app, and then click & drag it to the panel...
2011-04-30T02:00:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	trae	To customize it further, right click ti.
2011-04-30T02:00:00.000Z	trae	FunnyLookinHat	odd... I only get "keep in Launcher" when I right click
2011-04-30T02:00:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	trae	Oh hmmm
2011-04-30T02:00:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	trae	The other option is to create a folder of custom launchers in your home folder.
2011-04-30T02:01:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	trae	And then link those to your unity panel
2011-04-30T02:01:00.000Z	trae	FunnyLookinHat	lol
2011-04-30T02:01:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	trae	suffice it to say: http://i.imgur.com/zdIIa.png
2011-04-30T02:01:00.000Z	trae	FunnyLookinHat	yeah it's a fix... but.... sheesh... I hope Miguel didn't make these Gnome3 decisions  or I'll have to beat him and Nat.
2011-04-30T02:02:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	trae	I have a feeling the customization of Unity will be a big player in 11.10 - it's silly that you have to install ccsm just to adjust Unity's panel
2011-04-30T02:02:00.000Z	trae	FunnyLookinHat	seriously though, I appreciate the need for something new and flashy, but I'm not so sure why we had to push this alpha software out with 11.04
2011-04-30T02:03:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	trae	If you want to run Gnome - you can do so... simply select "Gnome Desktop" on the login screen...
2011-04-30T02:03:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	trae	No need to force yourself to use it unless you like it.
2011-04-30T02:03:00.000Z	trae	FunnyLookinHat	I may try though...   I do like you, in spite of your funny hat.
2011-04-30T02:03:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	trae	Hah!  Sounds good
2011-04-30T02:04:00.000Z	trae	FunnyLookinHat	thanks for the hack work-around, I thought of that but felt very dirty to even try it.  lol
2011-04-30T02:06:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	trae	ohsix yeah and the review process even involved a vote to back off Unity till 11.10
