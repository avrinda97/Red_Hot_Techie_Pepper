2008-06-11T18:11:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	Pici	/etc/apt/sources.list.d is empty
2008-06-11T18:10:00.000Z	Pici	JonathanEllis	Have you looked in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ ?
2008-06-11T18:11:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	Pici	No, not yet. But I will do that now. What does that directory do
2008-06-11T18:11:00.000Z	Pici	JonathanEllis	It holds more files that are used in addition to sources.list, not many things use it, but its another good place to check
2008-06-11T18:12:00.000Z	Pici	JonathanEllis	Can you pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list ?
2008-06-11T18:14:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	Pici	sure its http://pastebin.ca/1044844
2008-06-11T18:19:00.000Z	Pici	JonathanEllis	I see a few duplicates.. see lines 6 & 58 , 11 & 59, 19 & 58, and maybe another, I lost my place...
2008-06-11T18:20:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	Pici	Thanks. How did you search for duplicates?
2008-06-11T18:20:00.000Z	Pici	JonathanEllis	I grepped out the commented lines, then just looked through it.
2008-06-11T18:22:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	Pici	I imported the file into a spreadsheet then sorted but I didnt see any duplicates. I must be going mad
2008-06-11T18:25:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	Pici	Im just looking at the wikipedia entry for grep but I havent yet found out how to grep out the commented lines
2008-06-11T18:25:00.000Z	Pici	JonathanEllis	grep -v "#" filename
2008-06-11T20:18:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	Pici	Thanks for your help with my sources.list    I was confused because the lines werent identical. So now after looking at some documentation I understand how the sources.list file works and I have now tidied up the file.
2009-07-12T00:56:00.000Z	Pici	JonathanEllis	It does
2009-11-13T01:03:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	Pici	Thanks. I opened nautilus as root using gksudo nautilus. Then tried to navigate to /home/jonathan/.Trash but I get 'Couldn't find "/home/jonathan/.Trash".'
2009-11-13T01:06:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	Pici	Navigating to /home/jonathan/.local/share/Trash/ gives me two folders ('files' and 'info') but the folders I see in the user-level nautilus are not there. I am running Ubuntu 8.04 by the way
2009-11-13T01:07:00.000Z	Pici	JonathanEllis	What folders do you see in the trash from nautilus?
2009-11-13T01:11:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	Pici	Ah, found it! Didnt realise that the trash on an external drive is located in the <external drive>/.Trash-1000
2009-11-13T01:11:00.000Z	Pici	JonathanEllis	Yes, its silly, but it is what it is.
2009-11-13T01:11:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	Pici	Not silly - just takes a bit of finding
2009-11-13T01:12:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	Pici	It might be worth updating ubottus factoid.
