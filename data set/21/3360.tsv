2009-01-18T02:36:00.000Z	runderwo	jedi06	why would you use /dev/sda (the whole disk)?  Don't you want /dev/sda1 or something like that?
2009-01-18T02:37:00.000Z	runderwo	jedi06	/dev/sda is the whole disk, /dev/sda1 is a partition on the disk
2009-01-18T02:37:00.000Z	runderwo	jedi06	sometimes a whole disk has a filesystem on it, but very rarely.  Most always it is a partition that contains the filesystem.
2009-01-18T02:37:00.000Z	runderwo	jedi06	cfdisk /dev/sda
2009-01-18T02:38:00.000Z	jedi06	runderwo	ok it says sda1=Boot Primary and sda5= logical
2009-01-18T02:39:00.000Z	runderwo	jedi06	so, you probably want to use /dev/sda5
2009-01-18T02:40:00.000Z	jedi06	runderwo	but there is an sda sda1 sda2 and sda5  cfdisk doesn't say anything about sda2
2009-01-18T02:40:00.000Z	runderwo	jedi06	sda2 is probably the "extended partition" that houses the "logical drives" of which sda5 is the first.
2009-01-18T02:40:00.000Z	runderwo	jedi06	You can't use an "extended partition" directly.
2009-01-18T02:41:00.000Z	runderwo	jedi06	sda5 is contained within sda2 which is contained within sda
2009-01-18T02:41:00.000Z	runderwo	jedi06	The filesystem should be on sda5.
2009-01-18T02:53:00.000Z	jedi06	runderwo	couldn't determind file system type using sda5
2009-01-18T02:53:00.000Z	runderwo	jedi06	file /dev/sda5
2009-01-18T02:54:00.000Z	jedi06	runderwo	block special
2009-01-18T02:54:00.000Z	runderwo	jedi06	sorry, file -s /dev/sda5
2009-01-18T02:56:00.000Z	jedi06	runderwo	linux/i386 swap file (new style)
2009-01-18T02:56:00.000Z	runderwo	jedi06	Okay, so you must actually have wanted /dev/sda1 in that case.
2009-01-18T04:46:00.000Z	runderwo	jedi06	what does 'host server' tell you?
2009-01-18T04:48:00.000Z	runderwo	jedi06	Put an entry for 'server' in /etc/hosts
2009-01-18T04:49:00.000Z	runderwo	jedi06	So that it doesn't go ask the ISP who 'server' is.
