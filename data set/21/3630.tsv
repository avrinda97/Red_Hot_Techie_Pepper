2008-11-08T06:10:00.000Z	Kilmore		Hi i'm trying to get Ubuntu working on my inspiron 1100 laptop but after install and restart it never fully loads up, it loads to a point the whole screen is a tanish color, and never goes any further...
2008-11-08T06:11:00.000Z	Kilmore		!laptop
2008-11-08T06:11:00.000Z	neil_d	Kilmore	can you log into a console using <ctrl><alt><F1 .. 6> ?
2008-11-08T06:13:00.000Z	Kilmore	neil_d	: no I dont get anything when pressing that
2008-11-08T06:15:00.000Z	neil_d	Kilmore	ok!  You can get more info on where its stopping, by resetting and editing the grub command before it boots and remove the quite option.
2008-11-08T06:16:00.000Z	Kilmore	neil_d	how do i do that ?  I'm a total noob to any linux systems, i have been on windows for ever
2008-11-08T06:17:00.000Z	neil_d	Kilmore	ok, do see the grub boot screen ?
2008-11-08T06:20:00.000Z	neil_d	Kilmore	I am going by memory here, you stop it proceeding by pressing 'esc' (I think) so you can select the different options.  down at the bottom of the screen it gives a few keyboard commands to use. one of those is 'e' for edit, then whole complicated line appears, at the end of this the option 'quiet'.  remove this and hit enter to get grub to boot.
2008-11-08T06:26:00.000Z	neil_d	Kilmore	does the computer boot fine from the CD ?
2008-11-08T06:27:00.000Z	Kilmore	neil_d	it did before i did install
2008-11-08T06:27:00.000Z	neil_d	Kilmore	good. does the <ctrl><att><F1> show anything ?
2008-11-08T06:30:00.000Z	neil_d	Kilmore	good. does the <ctrl><att><F1> all at the same time.
2008-11-08T06:31:00.000Z	neil_d	Kilmore	try <ctrl><att><F1> all at the same time. does it show anything ?
2008-11-08T06:34:00.000Z	neil_d	Kilmore	ok, log in, and try the command "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
2008-11-08T06:38:00.000Z	neil_d	Kilmore	when replying use the nick of the person to its more visible.  nearly missed that one.  So it doesn't like the name/password you gave it during setup ?
2008-11-08T06:42:00.000Z	neil_d	Kilmore	something strange there.  is there text appearing on the screen ?  it shouldn't be doing anything but be asking for a login "<name> login:"
2008-11-08T06:45:00.000Z	neil_d	Kilmore	then you type your name hit enter then the password and enter again... what happens ?
2008-11-08T06:50:00.000Z	neil_d	Kilmore	I got no idea what is going on.  maybe you should try a reinstall.  never had it refuse to accept a login.
2008-11-08T06:50:00.000Z	Kilmore	neil_d	: lol ok, i'll mess with it tonight thanks for trying
2008-11-08T06:51:00.000Z	neil_d	Kilmore	np
