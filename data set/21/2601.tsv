2009-08-23T16:12:00.000Z	Chris220		hmm... if ~/ is the same as /home/username...
2009-08-23T16:13:00.000Z	Chris220		netsplit...?
2009-08-23T16:13:00.000Z	Chris220		anyway
2009-08-23T16:13:00.000Z	Chris220		Where do I find those folders like .xchat2 and .blender and so on?
2009-08-23T16:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Chris220	 they are in the users home directory
2009-08-23T16:14:00.000Z	Chris220		But my "Home" directory just contains Pictures, Music ETC
2009-08-23T16:14:00.000Z	Chris220		Am I looking at the wrong Home?
2009-08-23T16:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Chris220	 tell the file manager to show Hidden files...
2009-08-23T16:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		or type in the full path in the address bar
2009-08-23T16:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		!hidden
2009-08-23T16:15:00.000Z	Chris220		Oh

2009-08-23T16:15:00.000Z	Chris220		Thanks :D
2009-08-23T16:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Chris220	 logical eh?
2009-08-23T16:15:00.000Z	Chris220		Yeah makes sense now ;)
2009-08-23T16:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		Much easier then that disaster hiding things from the user that windows does..
2009-08-23T16:15:00.000Z	Chris220		haha yes!
2009-08-23T16:16:00.000Z	Chris220		Ok so what if I want to save a file from gedit in those hidden folders? How do I show them?
2009-08-23T16:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Chris220	 type in the full path.. or use teh show hidden files.. option..
2009-08-23T16:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		logical? :)
2009-08-23T16:17:00.000Z	Chris220	Dr_Willis	type in the full path where? There's no path "bar" in gedit's save dialog as far as I can see?
