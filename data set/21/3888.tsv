2008-09-24T19:56:00.000Z	Neaai		Hello all. When I do a lsmod I can see a module "wlan" in use by "ath_pci". Does that mean my laptop's Athereos is detected? If yes, how come I don't have a wireless interface yet when I do iwconfig ?

2008-09-24T19:59:00.000Z	Neaai	erUSUL	That says the driver is in use.
2008-09-24T20:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	Neaai	yep.. are tey both enabled?
2008-09-24T20:03:00.000Z	Neaai	erUSUL	yes they are checked and status "in use"
2008-09-24T20:03:00.000Z	Neaai	erUSUL	but I can't see a wireless interface
2008-09-24T20:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	Neaai	check this https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/218892 http://madwifi.org/wiki/UserDocs/Distro/Ubuntu and (apostledeets post) http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=878148
2008-09-24T20:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	Neaai	you do not need to recompile the kernel only the madwifi driver
2008-12-05T20:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	Neaai	Network Manager uses gconf i think
2008-12-05T20:07:00.000Z	Neaai	erUSUL	so while I have never had to use gconf, I need to think about this too? What was wrong with /etc/network/interfaces ?
2008-12-05T20:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	Neaai	nothing you can still use it. ifaces listed in interfaces will be ignored by network manager
2008-12-05T20:09:00.000Z	erUSUL	Neaai	you have to edit interfaces with a text editor though
2008-12-05T20:10:00.000Z	Neaai	erUSUL	I see. Also some other thing I've noticed. My default gateway knows how to route the ip block 169.254.1.0/24.  When I add a route for 169.254.0.0/16 to go to my gateway ip, nothing happens. My box and the gateway have public ip addresses. Is there any option that prevents the packets related to the private 169.254 block from ever exiting ?
2008-12-05T20:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	Neaai	i'm not a network expert but afaik 169.254.*.* are reserved ip that can not be used...
2008-12-05T20:13:00.000Z	Neaai	erUSUL	indeed. But the same operation worked when I used 8.04 and now that I have 8.10 it doesn't work.
2008-12-05T20:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	Neaai	well i was wrong and right... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-local_address they can be used but can't be routed if i read it correctly
2008-12-05T20:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	Neaai	that's as far as i can help you you wil have to find someone who knows more about networks than i
2008-12-05T20:18:00.000Z	Neaai	erUSUL	I see. Well I suspect that it can be an option in the kernel probably that prevents that in order to be rfc compliant. I know I'm willingly breaking some rfc here but I need it such. Interesting issue this one.
2008-12-05T20:18:00.000Z	Neaai	erUSUL	something that maybe 8.10 has active by default while 8.04 didn't.
2008-12-05T20:42:00.000Z	Neaai	erUSUL	I solved that routing issue. Apparently, adding the desired route via the nm-applet at topright of the screen doesn't work. I had to add it from the command line:     route add -net 169.254.0.0/16 gw <public.ip.of.gateway>
