2009-07-09T13:10:00.000Z	mechdave	cehr	maybe you could look at the file /var/log/messages it may give you an idea as to what is going on
2009-07-09T13:15:00.000Z	cehr	mechdave	http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/213499/ from using a few a different commands.  no idea what it really means.
2009-07-09T13:16:00.000Z	mechdave	cehr	looks like your libc6 may be crook
2009-07-09T13:17:00.000Z	mechdave	cehr	what happened right before everything started segfaulting?
2009-07-09T13:19:00.000Z	cehr	mechdave	firefox has been randomly closing and then earlier just refused to open, in a terminal it gave the message "Couldn't load XPCOM." so I installed dillo since I couldn't think of anything else, through aptitude, and it segfaulted everything after that
2009-07-09T13:20:00.000Z	mechdave	cehr	try and un install dillo by apt-get remove dillo
2009-07-09T13:21:00.000Z	cehr	mechdave	segfault.  how do I run firefox in safe mode?
2009-07-09T13:23:00.000Z	mechdave	cehr	firefox -safe-mode
2009-07-09T13:24:00.000Z	cehr	mechdave	still "couldn't load XPCOM"
2009-07-09T13:28:00.000Z	mechdave	cehr	Hmmmm now I am getting hazy on what to do next... Any one else got any ideas what is causing cehr's SEGFAULTs?
2009-07-09T13:30:00.000Z	cehr	mechdave	a few days ago I installed firefox 3.5 through proposed, but soon removed it.  could that have caused anything?
2009-07-09T13:31:00.000Z	mechdave	cehr	try and re name your $HOME/.mozilla folder to something else
2009-07-09T13:34:00.000Z	cehr	mechdave	no dice, firefox still errors even in safe-mode and doesn't try and make a new .mozilla or anything either... hmm
2009-07-09T13:38:00.000Z	mechdave	cehr	I reckon you could try and re install all the packages that are seg faulting starting with libc6
2009-07-09T13:41:00.000Z	cehr	mechdave	the problem is that apt-get, aptitude and synaptic all segfault.  is there an alternate method?
2009-07-09T13:41:00.000Z	mechdave	cehr	Uuuummmmm
2009-07-09T13:43:00.000Z	cehr	mechdave	could I do it through the ubuntu livecd, maybe?
2009-07-09T13:43:00.000Z	mechdave	cehr	I don't know... There has to be something changed to make it all segfault, but what?
2009-07-09T13:46:00.000Z	mechdave	cehr	there may be a way, try booting the livecd as you suggested and then mounting the / partition and then chroot to it and then try the apt-get --reinstall the packages that are affected install
2009-07-09T13:49:00.000Z	cehr	mechdave	alright, I will try that and come back here if there are any issues. thanks a lot :)
2009-07-09T13:49:00.000Z	mechdave	cehr	no worries... hope it works
