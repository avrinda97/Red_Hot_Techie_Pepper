2010-04-26T21:22:00.000Z	Maletor		Why does uname -a show me an older version of a kernel. I have it listing 2.6.31-20-generic when i have 2.6.32-21-generic in /boot
2010-04-26T21:23:00.000Z	sipior	Maletor	are you actually running the -21 kernel?
2010-04-26T21:23:00.000Z	Maletor	sipior	what? $ uname -a
2010-04-26T21:24:00.000Z	sipior	Maletor	i imagine you've still got both versions in /boot, and are running the old one at the moment.
2010-04-26T21:24:00.000Z	Maletor	sipior	yes, the older one is listed in /boot, i want to upgrade to the newer one :)
2010-04-26T21:24:00.000Z	sipior	Maletor	does it not appear in the grub menu at boot?
2010-04-26T21:26:00.000Z	sipior	Maletor	the new kernel should come up by default. remote kernel upgrades are always dicey: have you got someone on the other end to kick the machine if the new kernel has problems?
2010-04-26T21:27:00.000Z	sipior	Maletor	or have ipmi working, &cet.
2010-04-26T21:27:00.000Z	Maletor	sipior	i did sudo reboot now after sudo apt-get upgrade
2010-04-26T21:29:00.000Z	sipior	Maletor	check the config file and make sure it says what you think it does...
2010-04-26T21:30:00.000Z	sipior	Maletor	/boot/grub/grub.cfg
2010-04-26T21:31:00.000Z	Maletor	sipior	# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE
2010-04-26T21:31:00.000Z	sipior	Maletor	i said "make sure it says what you think it does"
2010-04-26T21:31:00.000Z	Maletor	sipior	and it does not, the menuentry is for 2.6.31-20 only
2010-04-26T21:32:00.000Z	sipior	Maletor	well, there you go
2010-04-26T21:33:00.000Z	sipior	Maletor	i would verify that the kernel package was installed properly
2010-04-26T21:34:00.000Z	sipior	Maletor	should've been done by the package, i should think...anyway, glad it's working.
2010-04-26T21:36:00.000Z	sipior	Maletor	you might try reinstalling the kernel package first. where there no errors? also, you'll want a copy of grub.cfg...
2010-04-26T21:36:00.000Z	sipior	Maletor	just reinstall the kernel packages you updated.
2010-04-26T21:39:00.000Z	sipior	Maletor	what part of "beta"...
2010-04-26T21:40:00.000Z	sipior	Maletor	it ain't released yet. that's why it's called "release candidate" , and not "release".
