2007-09-03T09:00:00.000Z	Pelo	lxuser_	 /dev/sda1 is the devtree for your usb hdd ????   what is your / partition on ?
2007-09-03T09:01:00.000Z	Pelo	lxuser_	 well assuming that it's correct  type these two cmmand in the therminal    sudo mkdir /media/USB         and   sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/USB

2007-09-03T09:05:00.000Z	Pelo	lxuser_	 ok make a note of the second command  you'll probably need it in the future ,  but I don'T know why it doesnT' automount
2007-09-03T09:06:00.000Z	Pelo	lxuser_	it usualy does it lke that,  if you can try with another usb drive like a flash drive or a mp3 player  see if they automount  if not , you have a more complicated problems if they do mount then it might be an isses with that particular hdd
