2007-05-17T05:12:00.000Z	rollerskatejamms		Anybody here have a blackberry?
2007-05-17T05:13:00.000Z	rollerskatejamms		What do you guys do in terms of syncing you blackberry? I know you can sync palms fine with linux but I see nothing about blackberry in the repositories.
2007-05-17T05:14:00.000Z	PriceChild	rollerskatejamms	please don't suggest root shells... we have sudo for a reason :)
2007-05-17T05:15:00.000Z	rollerskatejamms	PriceChild	Yeah well when you have to execute like 50 manually commands as root, its a pain to type sudo 50 times.
2007-05-17T05:15:00.000Z	PriceChild	rollerskatejamms	I've had this conversation with someone already tonight... :P
2007-05-17T05:15:00.000Z	PriceChild	rollerskatejamms	What if you made a mistake?
2007-05-17T05:16:00.000Z	rollerskatejamms	PriceChild	Dervish ensures that won't be a problem.
2007-05-17T05:16:00.000Z	PriceChild	rollerskatejamms	dervish?
2007-05-17T05:16:00.000Z	rollerskatejamms	PriceChild	Dervish = Nightly backups of the ENTIRE filesystem on every box I run. And I keep 2 weeks of backups, meaning 14 seperate backups, rotating.
2007-05-17T05:17:00.000Z	rollerskatejamms	PriceChild	I'm fairly paranoid.
2007-05-17T05:17:00.000Z	rollerskatejamms	PriceChild	And if i make a mistake, what difference does it make if I did it as sudo, or in sudo -i
2007-05-17T05:17:00.000Z	PriceChild	rollerskatejamms	very nice! :) I wish I had the space for that :)
2007-05-17T05:17:00.000Z	rollerskatejamms	PriceChild	Either way its a mistake done as root.
2007-05-17T05:18:00.000Z	PriceChild	rollerskatejamms	dosen't make a difference to you i suppose... but things are better logged with sudo
2007-05-17T05:18:00.000Z	rollerskatejamms	PriceChild	Actually that is a good point.
2007-05-17T05:18:00.000Z	rollerskatejamms	PriceChild	never thought about that.
2007-05-17T05:18:00.000Z	rollerskatejamms	PriceChild	yeah well, since I'm a consultant, I have an ever growing budget, in the sense that my budget is directly proportional to the amount of clients I have. So, I have some nice toys.
2007-05-17T05:19:00.000Z	PriceChild	rollerskatejamms	haha cool :)
2007-05-17T05:19:00.000Z	rollerskatejamms	PriceChild	Like sun T1000 nas and stuff like that.
2007-05-20T11:48:00.000Z	PriceChild	rollerskatejamms	increase time, decrease bandwidth
2007-05-20T11:48:00.000Z	rollerskatejamms	PriceChild	Its a local transfer to an external hd
