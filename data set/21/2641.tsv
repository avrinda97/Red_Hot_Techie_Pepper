2009-11-02T12:37:00.000Z	nDuff	ravenger	_which_ partition are you trying to resize? Is it on LVM? Is it your root? Etc.
2009-11-02T12:38:00.000Z	ravenger	nDuff	it is my /usr
2009-11-02T12:39:00.000Z	nDuff	ravenger	see GParted (it's in System/Administration), but note that if you aren't using LVM, there's only so much resizing which can be done "live".
2009-11-02T12:39:00.000Z	ravenger	nDuff	by resizing it i wan to install win xp but using the gparted it is saying some error
2009-11-02T12:40:00.000Z	nDuff	ravenger	"some error" is not very descriptive; could you be more precise?
2009-11-02T12:42:00.000Z	ravenger	nDuff	yeah actually to resize the partition u have to unmount the volume first so when i had done that the followin error is comming umount: /usr: device is busy.
2009-11-02T12:42:00.000Z	ravenger		        (In some cases useful info about processes that use
2009-11-02T12:42:00.000Z	ravenger		         the device is found by lsof(8) or fuser(1))
2009-11-02T12:44:00.000Z	nDuff	ravenger	are you trying to increase or decrease the size? Linux supports online resizing, if you're increasing the size of an ext2 or ext3 partition without moving it.
2009-11-02T12:44:00.000Z	nDuff	ravenger	where "online" resizing means that the partition does not, in fact, need to be unmounted.
2009-11-02T12:45:00.000Z	nDuff	ravenger	...man resize2fs to see the underlying tool for that.
2009-11-02T12:47:00.000Z	ravenger	nDuff	i want to do the online resizing
2009-11-02T12:47:00.000Z	ravenger	nDuff	now i have doubt can i resize the partition and can i install win xp in that new partiton
2009-11-02T12:47:00.000Z	nDuff	ravenger	waitamoment -- online resizing is expansion only
2009-11-02T12:48:00.000Z	nDuff	ravenger	if you want to make an existing partition _smaller_, you don't have a choice but to reboot into something (like a LiveCD) which doesn't need your /usr to be mounted.
2009-11-02T12:52:00.000Z	ravenger	nDuff	last and final doubt i had to log to the live cd option does it have any thing to do with my present ubuntu version since the present ununtu version of my system is 9.10 and the cd is 9.04 ?
2009-11-02T12:59:00.000Z	nDuff	ravenger	no, the versions don't need to match
