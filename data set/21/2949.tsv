2009-06-05T23:58:00.000Z	boss_mc		I've got updates waiting for linux-image but they keep being 'held-back'... do I just have to wait for the updates to arrive?
2009-06-05T23:59:00.000Z	Flannel	boss_mc	No, sudo apt-get dist-upgrade instead of upgrade
2009-06-05T23:59:00.000Z	boss_mc	Flannel	that says unmet dependencies and tries to remove linux-image in order to resolve them
2009-06-06T00:00:00.000Z	Flannel	boss_mc	That means you've got something going on.  What unmet dependencies?
2009-06-06T00:01:00.000Z	boss_mc	Flannel	http://paste.debian.net/38151/
2009-06-06T00:02:00.000Z	Flannel	boss_mc	do you have jaunty-proposed enabled by any chance? Mind pastbinning your sources.list?
2009-06-06T00:03:00.000Z	boss_mc	Flannel	I do have jaunty-proposed...
2009-06-06T00:03:00.000Z	boss_mc	Flannel	http://pastebin.com/f7606ec06
2009-06-06T00:04:00.000Z	Flannel	boss_mc	The contents would be nice :)
2009-06-06T00:04:00.000Z	boss_mc	Flannel	ha! echo != cat...

2009-06-06T00:05:00.000Z	Flannel	boss_mc	Right, you have jaunty-proposed enabled (you shouldn't!)  It is a staging area for packages, so it seems they've upgraded linux-generic there, and it doesn't have the other kernels yet.
2009-06-06T00:06:00.000Z	boss_mc	Flannel	hmmm, so I either remove the proposed or wait for the rest of the packages to arrive??
2009-06-06T00:06:00.000Z	Flannel	boss_mc	remove the propsed.  It's not meant for normal consumption
2009-06-06T00:07:00.000Z	boss_mc	Flannel	I'm removing it and downgrading packages
2009-06-06T00:08:00.000Z	Flannel	boss_mc	no need to downgrade, regular packages will catch up and you'll be fine.
2009-06-06T00:08:00.000Z	boss_mc	Flannel	good point
2009-06-06T00:08:00.000Z	Flannel	boss_mc	Assuming the packages are all stable now ;)
2009-06-06T00:12:00.000Z	boss_mc	Flannel	sigh, that was an error adding that repo... I've removed it, I'll check in a while to see if -updates has caught up
2009-06-06T00:12:00.000Z	boss_mc	Flannel	cheers
2009-08-03T07:11:00.000Z	Flannel	boss_mc	There's no reason to hand-edit passwd
