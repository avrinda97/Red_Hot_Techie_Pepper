2011-01-10T02:50:00.000Z	mongy		thinking about going back to 10.04 myself...mainly because of 11.04
2011-01-10T02:50:00.000Z	mongy		just means adding a list of ppa as long as my street
2011-01-10T02:51:00.000Z	mongy		just had a couple of odd things going on for no reason that I did not have in 10.10, and also, even with the fallback thing in 11.04, I dunno....
2011-01-10T02:51:00.000Z	mongy		bleeding edge does not seem so shiny to me now :)
2011-01-10T02:53:00.000Z	mongy		!upgrade | ghostnik11

2011-01-10T02:55:00.000Z	mongy		sorry, just very cynical now of upgrades... seen more go wrong than go right.  good luck.
2011-01-10T02:56:00.000Z	mongy		?
2011-01-10T02:58:00.000Z	Idol_Mind	mongy	will it affect performance much? I have 8GB of ram, so I'm sure I can set the swappiness pretty low safely
2011-01-10T02:58:00.000Z	mongy	Idol_Mind	lol.. no need for swap really..
2011-01-10T02:59:00.000Z	mongy	Idol_Mind	if anything, just set vm.swappiness 10 in /etc/sysctl.conf
2011-01-10T02:59:00.000Z	Idol_Mind	mongy	yeah, that was the idea
2011-01-10T03:01:00.000Z	mongy	Idol_Mind	thats remastersys then.
2011-01-10T03:01:00.000Z	Idol_Mind	mongy	that's awesome! wow
2011-01-10T03:03:00.000Z	mongy	Idol_Mind	if you copy you home (sudo cp -r . /etc/skel/) then it copies all your configs.. so just setup the same username and it wil be as if you cloned it
2011-01-10T03:03:00.000Z	Idol_Mind	mongy	/etc/skel? what is that?
2011-01-10T03:03:00.000Z	mongy	Idol_Mind	template for new user
2011-01-10T03:04:00.000Z	mongy	Idol_Mind	its a new install after all.
2011-01-10T03:04:00.000Z	Idol_Mind	mongy	oh, cool. Will remastersys copy partition design or will it prompt me?
2011-01-10T03:04:00.000Z	mongy	Idol_Mind	ithink of it as, ubuntu installer, with different apps, and your home as the default.
2011-01-10T03:05:00.000Z	Idol_Mind	mongy	that's neat.. definately gonna try this out
