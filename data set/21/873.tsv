2011-07-06T15:43:00.000Z	ledjo		ok then recommend me another support
2011-07-06T15:44:00.000Z	ledjo		yes i searched everything but there is nothing on how to moubt usb when u cant se which dev it uses...
2011-07-06T15:44:00.000Z	ledjo		so
2011-07-06T15:44:00.000Z	ledjo		just a sec
2011-07-06T15:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis|2	ledjo	 theres always askubuntu.com and the forums
2011-07-06T15:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis|2	ledjo	 if a usb device when plugged in - does not get a /dev/sdXX entry assigned to it.. then theres somthing wrong with the kernel, or drivers, or device.
2011-07-06T15:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis|2	ledjo	 unless its some sort of special usb device.  - i cant think of ny usb storage tht dosent use sdXX
2011-07-06T15:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis|2	ledjo	 does 'sudo fdisk -l' show them?
2011-07-06T15:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis|2	ledjo	 then you got a deeper issue..  when you plug them -  wait a moment or two. then check 'dmesg' output..  do dmesg a few times  a few sec apart. and see if any info on the device shows up
2011-07-06T15:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis|2	ledjo	 i just got off work. :)  from what ive heard so far.. its pointong to either a bad usb port. or cable. or some very weird kernel issue..  a interesting test would be to see if a ubuntu live cd, and some other disrto (like tinycorelinux) could activate the device. IF one of those work.. check the  'lsmod' output to see what modules are getting loaded.
2011-07-06T15:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis|2	ledjo	 all i can suggest is check with a live cd or 2. check out the lsmod output.. and verify that they do work with a live cd.
2011-07-06T15:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis|2	ledjo	 thats from the not-working system?
2011-07-06T16:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis|2	ledjo	 ive had to manually do a lot in xp.... like ,,,, well thats for the OT channel...
2011-07-06T16:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis|2	ledjo	 i will pass on the discussion for now. I have other things to do.
2011-07-06T16:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis|2	ledjo	 Not related to 'ubuntu support' so  not rellevant.. did you test that box with a ubuntu live cd yet? compare teh lsmod outputs?
