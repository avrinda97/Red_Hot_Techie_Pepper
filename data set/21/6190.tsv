2007-05-15T06:58:00.000Z	yoda2031		why does ubuntu say my HDD is "0 bytes big"? it's only a gui issue, I can read/write to it...
2007-05-15T07:00:00.000Z	Pelo	yoda2031	 internal hdd ? what kind , what filesystem ?
2007-05-15T07:00:00.000Z	yoda2031	Pelo	fat afaik, although when I formatted to put ubuntu on it didn't ask me what filesystem to use
2007-05-15T07:01:00.000Z	Pelo	yoda2031	 check in gparted
2007-05-15T07:01:00.000Z	yoda2031	Pelo	it was using NTFS before for windows, so it could still be NTFS :-\
2007-05-15T07:02:00.000Z	Pelo	yoda2031	 if you reformated with gparted defaults it might now be ext3
2007-05-15T07:03:00.000Z	yoda2031	Pelo	I reformated with the ubuntu 7.04 installer :P
2007-05-15T07:04:00.000Z	Pelo	yoda2031	  sudo apt-get install gparted to install gparted and then check, ( gparted will be in system > admin > gnome partition editor)
2007-05-15T07:05:00.000Z	yoda2031	Pelo	k
2007-05-15T07:06:00.000Z	yoda2031	Pelo	yup it's ext3 and it's displaying correctly in partition manager
2007-05-15T07:06:00.000Z	yoda2031	Pelo	can I get it to display correctly in file browser or not?
2007-05-15T07:07:00.000Z	Pelo	yoda2031	 I don'T know , I was hunting for a format problem  , clearly that's not the case
2007-05-15T07:07:00.000Z	yoda2031	Pelo	it seems not, it's not important really, it's not affecting read/write to the drive
2007-05-15T07:08:00.000Z	Pelo	yoda2031	 look it up in the forum maybe it's just a little thing
2007-05-15T07:09:00.000Z	yoda2031	Pelo	I'm not that fussed to be honest, atm I'm more bothered about getting an mp3 decoder :P
2007-05-15T07:09:00.000Z	Pelo	yoda2031	 soundconverter  and install all the gstreamer stuff ,  the good the bad and the ugly
2007-05-15T07:10:00.000Z	yoda2031	Pelo	tyvm :)
2007-05-15T07:11:00.000Z	Pelo	yoda2031	 very much so
2007-05-15T07:12:00.000Z	Pelo	yoda2031	 ogg vorbis,  a free audio format
2007-05-15T07:14:00.000Z	Pelo	yoda2031	 fyi,  my next mp3 player will have ogg on it native,  I have had it with converting files,
2007-05-15T07:14:00.000Z	yoda2031	Pelo	cool!
