2006-03-02T14:51:00.000Z	northie		I do a  sudo loadkeys fi-latin1, but and get a Loading echo, but still have the same layout.
2006-03-02T14:51:00.000Z	northie		How do I change my keyboard layout?
2006-03-02T14:53:00.000Z	northie		gxine, Jivenix.
2006-03-02T14:54:00.000Z	northie		vlc, I'd say.
2006-03-02T14:54:00.000Z	northie		videolanclient, jivenix. It's in the repositories.
2006-03-02T14:56:00.000Z	northie		What config ought I edit to change my keyboard layout?
2006-03-02T14:58:00.000Z	pfp	northie	for X or text mode?
2006-03-02T14:59:00.000Z	northie	pfp	for X.
2006-03-02T14:59:00.000Z	northie	pfp	where's xorg.conf again?
2006-03-02T14:59:00.000Z	pfp	northie	/etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-03-02T14:59:00.000Z	northie		This is freaky. I can apparently change to some keyboards without a bother, but when I attempt to go to the Finnish one, it throws me through desktop themes.
2006-03-02T14:59:00.000Z	northie		Thanks, both of you.
2006-03-02T15:00:00.000Z	pfp	northie	there's a known bug that does that when you choose keyboard maps
2006-03-02T15:01:00.000Z	northie	pfp	all right, but it doesn't do that when I change to a map that works.
2006-03-02T15:01:00.000Z	pfp	northie	(there's also an entry in bugzilla that links to a couple of .debs that (try to) fix it)
2006-03-02T15:01:00.000Z	pfp	northie	i see
2006-03-02T15:03:00.000Z	northie	pfp	and it gives me the message.. The loading of the image gnome-fs-home failed
2006-03-02T15:03:00.000Z	northie		Details: icon not found.
2006-03-02T15:04:00.000Z	northie		Maybe, freakishly enough, there's a bit lacking in one of my themes, and if I fix that, I can change keyboard layouts again :p
2006-03-02T15:06:00.000Z	pfp	northie	i don't remember seeing that msg - just gnome/gkt2 theme freaking out for a couple of sec
2006-03-02T15:08:00.000Z	northie	pfp	that's not the exact wording, but translated.
