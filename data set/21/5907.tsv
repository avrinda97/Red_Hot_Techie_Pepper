2007-07-28T08:20:00.000Z	Eugene12	madman91	Let me look...
2007-07-28T08:21:00.000Z	Eugene12	madman91	yes, that's not related to my issue - I don't see wifi network card after resume
2007-07-28T08:21:00.000Z	Eugene12	madman91	tried to reload all modules related to pcmcia - didn't help

2007-07-28T08:25:00.000Z	madman91	Eugene12	thats the problem.. i dont know if that solution will work
2007-07-28T08:25:00.000Z	madman91	Eugene12	read through all of those.. and if you make any changes, remember where you made them to fix them later
2007-07-28T08:26:00.000Z	Eugene12	madman91	a lot of reading :) Thanks for pointing!
2007-07-28T08:26:00.000Z	madman91	Eugene12	it looks like the problem.. so you might pick up a bit of little solutions and patch them together
2007-07-28T08:26:00.000Z	madman91	Eugene12	good luck
