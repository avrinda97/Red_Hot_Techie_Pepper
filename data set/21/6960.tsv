2007-04-08T14:49:00.000Z	cole		kvazi: rootkits arent like viruses at all
2007-04-08T14:49:00.000Z	cole		kvazi: rootkits are...kits... that are used to maintain root acces on a nix box
2007-04-08T14:50:00.000Z	cole		kvazi: fyi thats a worm, not a virus, and depending on the machine- a rootkit can be considered harmless because of an unimportant machine or an important box
2007-04-08T14:51:00.000Z	cole		kvazi: if you give them access
2007-04-08T14:52:00.000Z	cole		kvazi: if you give them a user, or a potential of gaining any level of access on your box then they can... if they know how
2007-04-08T14:54:00.000Z	cole		kvazi: linux is designed to keep people out, if configured correctly- its almost invulnerable- but if you leave something open and vulnerable- and someone gets in- (they put a rootkit on it) its hard as heck to get them out
2007-04-08T14:54:00.000Z	cole		kvazi: unless you find the rootkit and get them out- which is easy considering your knowledge of linux
