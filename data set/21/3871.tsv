2008-09-11T13:46:00.000Z	outbackwifi	KillGuta	whats TF2
2008-10-04T21:31:00.000Z	outbackwifi	KillGuta	sudo apt-get remove program
2008-10-04T21:32:00.000Z	outbackwifi	KillGuta	yes unles its called "program"
2008-10-04T21:43:00.000Z	outbackwifi	KillGuta	that would not be necessary, use apt-get to install
2008-10-04T21:45:00.000Z	outbackwifi	KillGuta	the three quick steps for any installation from source are.. ./configure, make and make install
2008-10-04T21:48:00.000Z	outbackwifi	KillGuta	you  should first cd into the directory that you untarred wine source; then type ./configure (thats dot slash)
2008-10-04T21:56:00.000Z	outbackwifi	KillGuta	sudo file-roller
2008-11-08T21:25:00.000Z	outbackwifi	KillGuta	chatzilla, xchat, bitchx. pidgin
2008-11-08T21:27:00.000Z	outbackwifi	KillGuta	using wondershaper you can shape the traffic, but are you thinking quotas?
2008-11-08T21:27:00.000Z	KillGuta	outbackwifi	I only want to shape my traffic :D
2008-11-08T21:28:00.000Z	outbackwifi	KillGuta	wondershaper is great for that
2008-11-08T21:30:00.000Z	outbackwifi	KillGuta	no,  on the other hand, if its a linksys wrt54gl, you can replace the firmware with tomato or dd-wrt and do some magic like that :P
2008-11-08T21:43:00.000Z	outbackwifi	KillGuta	policy not police :)
2008-11-08T21:44:00.000Z	outbackwifi	KillGuta	what are you attempting; often a simple command like sudo wondershaper eth0 512 512 works just great
2008-11-08T21:45:00.000Z	KillGuta	outbackwifi	Still nothing
2008-11-08T21:45:00.000Z	outbackwifi	KillGuta	it will not give you a output; now type sudo wondershaper eth0 it should show you the queues
2008-11-08T21:47:00.000Z	outbackwifi	KillGuta	you need to run a download and test with and without wondershaper rules. thats what will show the difference
2008-11-08T21:47:00.000Z	KillGuta	outbackwifi	Nope, nothing changed
2008-11-08T21:48:00.000Z	outbackwifi	KillGuta	you should really read the wondershaper documentation
2008-11-08T22:17:00.000Z	outbackwifi	KillGuta	or behave
