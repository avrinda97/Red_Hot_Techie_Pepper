2005-05-05T11:58:00.000Z	Hoxzer		everything went so well until I edited .conf file :D
2005-05-05T11:59:00.000Z	Hoxzer		no way :D
2005-05-05T11:59:00.000Z	Hoxzer		now I have to install everything again
2005-05-05T12:00:00.000Z	topyli	Hoxzer	that's hard to believe. reinstall?
2005-07-10T05:27:00.000Z	topyli	Hoxzer	you can even have your own ubuntu installation on your own box!
2005-07-10T05:28:00.000Z	topyli	Hoxzer	who am i to argue with someone's mother? :)
2005-10-08T15:53:00.000Z	topyli	Hoxzer	i think it's ctrl-return by default
2005-10-08T15:53:00.000Z	topyli	Hoxzer	but i don't know how to set it up permanently
2005-10-08T15:55:00.000Z	topyli	Hoxzer	well, return, enter, as you wish :)
2005-10-08T15:56:00.000Z	topyli	Hoxzer	i seem to remember so. i've set it to ctrl-alt-enter though
2005-10-08T15:56:00.000Z	topyli	Hoxzer	so i can't be sure what it was before
2005-10-08T15:59:00.000Z	topyli	Hoxzer	i think more modern people than me usually call it the Enter key i guess :)
2005-10-08T16:00:00.000Z	topyli	Hoxzer	too much emacs manuals :)
2005-10-09T12:00:00.000Z	topyli	Hoxzer	hard to say since you don't tell us what sort of keyboard you have. usually i just hit keys blindly until i find the correct one :)
2005-10-09T12:00:00.000Z	Hoxzer	topyli	I cant find it :D
2005-10-09T12:43:00.000Z	topyli	Hoxzer	nethack and xgalaga work just fine here :)
2005-10-20T16:47:00.000Z	topyli	Hoxzer	it does, but i wouldn't install it on a server :)
2005-10-20T16:47:00.000Z	topyli	Hoxzer	i mean gnome
2005-10-20T16:49:00.000Z	Hoxzer	topyli	just asking cause http://www.cs.rit.edu/~css8044/?q=mythtv this guide is for ubuntu hoary server ;)
2005-10-20T16:50:00.000Z	topyli	Hoxzer	that's quite ok. i 'm pretty sure it would work on breezy too
2005-10-20T05:50:00.000Z	topyli	Hoxzer	ssh user@host
