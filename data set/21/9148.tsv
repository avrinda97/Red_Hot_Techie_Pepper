2005-11-25T09:32:00.000Z	LjL	msg43	the main package is called xserver-xorg, not xorg-server
2005-11-25T09:32:00.000Z	msg43	LjL	thanks I just relized that
2005-11-25T09:34:00.000Z	LjL	msg43	i don't know what you're doing, but leaving it empty often works
2005-11-25T09:36:00.000Z	LjL	msg43	always /etc/init.d/gdm start
2005-11-25T09:36:00.000Z	LjL	msg43	or restart -- never use startx, in any case
2005-11-25T10:48:00.000Z	LjL	msg43	like what?
2005-11-25T10:49:00.000Z	msg43	LjL	well I use archlinux as my main distro it when there a new package it will be update automatically
2005-11-25T10:49:00.000Z	LjL	msg43	well the "automatically" part is there in Ubuntu, it's just that Ubuntu has this 6-months release cycle... but you still get bugfixes, security fixes and also backports if you want
2005-11-25T10:54:00.000Z	LjL	msg43	can't you get to text mode?
2005-11-25T10:54:00.000Z	msg43	LjL	not when xorg start with the nvidia settings
2005-11-25T10:54:00.000Z	LjL	msg43	i see
