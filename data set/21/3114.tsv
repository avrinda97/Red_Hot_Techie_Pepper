2009-05-10T21:12:00.000Z	benni		can someone tell me why my ubuntu uses swap and becomes dog slow when there are 3GB of RAM left?
2009-05-10T21:13:00.000Z	tones	benni	do you hear disk thrashing when it happens?
2009-05-10T21:13:00.000Z	benni	tones	I think so, but most of the time I listen to music
2009-05-10T21:14:00.000Z	tones	benni	it may be that your swap is configured incorrectly in /etc/fstab.

2009-05-10T21:16:00.000Z	tones	benni	run [ ls -la /dev/disk/by-uuid/ | grep sda5 | awk '{ print $8 }' ]
2009-05-10T21:16:00.000Z	tones	benni	does it output 352a79a7-2405-4854-99b8-4c75d205a257
2009-05-10T21:17:00.000Z	benni	tones	yes
2009-05-10T21:17:00.000Z	tones	benni	ok, then its not your fstab. im out of ideas :s sorry
2009-05-10T21:18:00.000Z	benni	tones	thanks anyway :)
2009-05-10T21:18:00.000Z	tones	benni	no worries :)
2009-05-10T21:19:00.000Z	benni	tones	the anoying thins is, the system becomes unresponsive, audio stutters, etc, really sad to see 3GB free RAM unused
2009-05-10T21:20:00.000Z	tones	benni	can you switch to another tty while it happens?
2009-05-10T21:21:00.000Z	benni	tones	swap is almost as big as used ram at the moment, system is fine, but as swap fills its really bad
2009-05-10T21:22:00.000Z	tones	benni	i cant think of much else to do. maybe disable the swap completely?
2009-05-10T21:22:00.000Z	benni	tones	when running swapoff -a the swap empties but takes the whole system down most of the time
2009-05-10T21:23:00.000Z	benni	tones	I'll try
2009-05-10T21:26:00.000Z	benni	tones	Ok its gone, let's see how it works out
2009-05-10T21:27:00.000Z	tones	benni	ok, hope it works :)
2009-05-10T22:06:00.000Z	benni	tones	works out quite well so far :)
2009-05-10T22:07:00.000Z	tones	benni	good to know
