2005-06-05T12:35:00.000Z	medkit_		hi all again
2005-06-05T12:37:00.000Z	medkit_		Howto mount IDE Harddisks attached to a PCI IDE Controller? Device is called HPT372A with 4 IDE channels.
2005-06-05T12:39:00.000Z	HappyFool	medkit_	take a look in /proc/ide (ls /proc/ide) -- it has info on the ide channels etc that have been detected
2005-06-05T12:43:00.000Z	medkit_	HappyFool	possibly ide0 and ide1?
2005-06-05T12:44:00.000Z	HappyFool	medkit_	i would guess ide2 and greater, assuming you have two onboard IDE channels
2005-06-05T12:46:00.000Z	medkit_	HappyFool	2 onboard ide channels, these are ide0 and ide1. So the controller channels are not listed in /proc/ide
2005-06-05T12:47:00.000Z	HappyFool	medkit_	is it possible that they will look like scsi drives ? see e.g., http://lists.suse.com/archive/suse-linux-e/2003-Feb/1719.html
2005-06-05T12:48:00.000Z	medkit_	HappyFool	yes, under windows the controller is always treated as scsi controller.
2005-06-05T12:48:00.000Z	HappyFool	medkit_	try 'cat /proc/scsi/scsi' -- does it list anything
2005-06-05T12:50:00.000Z	medkit_	HappyFool	yes, an sda harddisk wich is attached to the onboard SATA Controller. This is a Sil3112. Nohing else.
2005-06-05T12:54:00.000Z	medkit_	HappyFool	alright, found it. It is an Highpoint Controller and there are some Linux driver available for it.
2005-06-05T12:54:00.000Z	HappyFool	medkit_	yeah, i was going to post this: http://www.usenetlinux.com/archive/index.php/t-109608.html  -- looks like you might need a custom kernel driver
2005-06-05T12:58:00.000Z	medkit_	HappyFool	that sounds difficult.
2005-06-05T12:59:00.000Z	HappyFool	medkit_	i wouldn't worry about the initrd stuff mentioned on that page, unless you want to put your boot partition on those discs
2005-06-05T13:03:00.000Z	medkit_	HappyFool	booting from the HPT372 is not intended. In the post i'm still missing the step on how to make the harddisks on the HPT work.
2005-06-05T13:04:00.000Z	HappyFool	medkit_	i imagine you'll need to get the highpoint controller, as you mentioned before, possibly compile it (or pieces of it), and load the final module
2005-06-05T13:05:00.000Z	HappyFool	medkit_	if you need to compile kernel modules, install packages build-essential and linux-headers-386 (or possibly -686, or whatever kernel image you're running)
2005-06-05T13:07:00.000Z	HappyFool	medkit_	you can do installations using synaptic; both packages ( -386 for headers) are on the install CD
2005-06-05T13:08:00.000Z	medkit_	HappyFool	i have the modules and Kernel 2.6.10-5-k7 and gcc but this compiling thing is one step beyond my capabilities. But i thank you for now. I will try to learn this.
2005-06-05T13:09:00.000Z	HappyFool	medkit_	hopefully the module comes with a README or INSTALL file. If you have difficulties, please ask here
2005-06-05T13:20:00.000Z	medkit_	HappyFool	dmesg tells that hpt366 ide_disk and hpt 34x are linked in but not 372A.
