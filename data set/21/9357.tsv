2006-12-08T09:17:00.000Z	unimatrix9		i still have the same problem, my monitor is set at 75 hz, but needs to be 60 hz, any tips would be welcom
2006-12-08T09:18:00.000Z	unimatrix9		what would the line be to add to xorf.conf?
2006-12-08T09:18:00.000Z	unimatrix9		for 60 hz resolution?
2006-12-08T09:18:00.000Z	soundray	unimatrix9	go through 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg', take all the defaults, except in the Monitor section. There, choose "Simple" and tell it what your monitor can do at its best
2006-12-08T09:19:00.000Z	soundray	unimatrix9	also check out fixres:
2007-03-20T13:16:00.000Z	soundray	unimatrix9	it's not a package -- it's part of the feisty installation. Please ask in #ubuntu+1
2007-03-21T15:14:00.000Z	soundray	unimatrix9	unless you installed faulty RAM
2007-03-21T15:17:00.000Z	soundray	unimatrix9	other things can go wrong: asymmetry, modules unsupported by your BIOS, etc.
2007-03-21T15:17:00.000Z	soundray	unimatrix9	it's also possible in some boards to install more than your BIOS can handle.
2007-03-21T15:18:00.000Z	unimatrix9	soundray	yes i know, but i wanted to be sure its not a linux fault
2007-06-16T16:48:00.000Z	soundray	unimatrix9	apt-get -d (man apt-get helps)
2007-06-16T16:49:00.000Z	soundray	unimatrix9	it'll be downloaded to /var/cache/apt/archives/
2007-06-16T16:49:00.000Z	soundray	unimatrix9	with -d it will get downloaded, but not installed
2007-06-16T16:50:00.000Z	soundray	unimatrix9	apt-get -d install packagename
2007-11-06T02:11:00.000Z	soundray	unimatrix9	probably with mplayer and scaling options
2008-05-17T18:47:00.000Z	soundray	unimatrix9	they are a total pain in the neck. I ripped the card out of my wife's laptop and replaced it with an Intel one.
2008-05-17T18:47:00.000Z	soundray	unimatrix9	no more problems since
2008-05-17T18:48:00.000Z	soundray	unimatrix9	it can't just have been a driver issue. I had dropping connections and other failures under a popular closed-source OS as well.
2008-05-21T21:45:00.000Z	soundray	unimatrix9	I don't think it's possible
2008-05-21T21:45:00.000Z	soundray	unimatrix9	where else would you find an error message about a past condition, if not in the logs?
2008-05-21T21:45:00.000Z	soundray	unimatrix9	you may have to boot without splash to see them.
