2010-05-27T05:53:00.000Z	neezer		I am trying to add a folder to my webserver. I want to put a bunch of files in /var/www/html. They are also in /home/neezer.....I don't want them to be in two places at once, but I'd like to keep them in /home/nathan....is there a way I can keep the files in /home/nathan and still have them browseable from the internet?
2010-05-27T05:54:00.000Z	cjdevlin	neezer	google symbolic link
2010-05-27T05:55:00.000Z	neezer	cjdevlin	I did and tried ln -s /home/neezer from my var/www/html/folder, but it didn't work....I don't think anyways...
2010-05-27T05:56:00.000Z	cjdevlin	neezer	did you use sudo?
2010-05-27T05:57:00.000Z	neezer	cjdevlin	I am doing this as root, yes.
