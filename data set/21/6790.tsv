2007-06-02T05:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Damian	network-manager or network-admin ( System -> Administration -> Networking )
2007-06-02T05:58:00.000Z	Damian	Jordan_U	i'll try it again once it installs
2007-06-02T05:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Damian	Is it recognised as a wireless card in the network-manager applet at the top right of the screen?
2007-06-02T06:01:00.000Z	Damian	Jordan_U	give me a minute here its still installing onto my HD now
2007-06-02T06:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Damian	You can check from the LiveCD while it's installing
2007-06-02T06:01:00.000Z	Damian	Jordan_U	when i was running the livecd it did
2007-06-02T06:07:00.000Z	Damian	Jordan_U	ok it's installed where do i go to enter the ssid and wep code?
2007-06-02T06:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Damian	Just connect to the network and it will ask for the password
2007-06-02T06:10:00.000Z	Damian	Jordan_U	i need to specify my ssid though
2007-06-02T06:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Damian	It's hidden?
2007-06-02T06:10:00.000Z	Damian	Jordan_U	i dont see anywehre to type it in in properties
2007-06-02T06:12:00.000Z	Damian	Jordan_U	the light that usually lights up to show that the wireless card is enabled isnt even on
2007-06-02T06:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Damian	Is your wireless ssid hidden?
2007-06-02T06:13:00.000Z	Damian	Jordan_U	yes
2007-06-02T06:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Damian	Ok, try wifi-radar then, or setting up your /etc/networking/interfaces manually
2007-06-02T06:14:00.000Z	Damian	Jordan_U	where is wifi-radar?
2007-06-02T06:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Damian	sudo apt-get install wifi-radar ( or install it through synaptic )
