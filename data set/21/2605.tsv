2009-08-21T13:23:00.000Z	fvila	mapper	well, you can dig especifically to the slave
2009-08-21T13:24:00.000Z	fvila	mapper	dig @slave-ip domain
2009-08-21T13:26:00.000Z	mapper	fvila	we have LBR in front of these 2 slaves. It keeps showing me the LBR VIP in the AUTHORITY SECTION
2009-08-21T13:27:00.000Z	fvila	mapper	and can you log in to the slave machine?
2009-08-21T13:27:00.000Z	mapper	fvila	Yes, I just did that on the slave machine.
2009-08-21T13:27:00.000Z	fvila	mapper	from there you could try a dig localhost....
2009-08-21T13:27:00.000Z	fvila	mapper	mmmmm
2009-08-21T13:27:00.000Z	mapper	fvila	I did that as well.
2009-08-21T13:29:00.000Z	fvila	mapper	now I can't find a way to check.... and in the slave configuration files, the slave zone files are created?
2009-08-21T13:30:00.000Z	mapper	fvila	basically the slave configuration file is messed up, dev and test zones from master are all configured to point to dev zone on both slave servers.
2009-08-21T13:30:00.000Z	mapper	fvila	but it works for more than a year.
2009-08-21T13:31:00.000Z	mapper	fvila	So if I update conf file for dev, it would update that same dev zone file, same thing if updating test zone conf file on master node.
2009-08-21T13:32:00.000Z	fvila	mapper	mmmm
2009-08-21T13:33:00.000Z	fvila	mapper	I can't find a way another than recreating the slave configuration and configure master to point to the correct files....
2009-08-21T13:34:00.000Z	fvila	mapper	if you want to check if the slave answers, you can try with tcpdump or another sniffer
2009-08-21T13:34:00.000Z	fvila	mapper	you can filter to the dns port...
2009-08-21T13:34:00.000Z	mapper	fvila	The master is having the right configuration, the problem is with the slave.
2009-08-21T13:35:00.000Z	fvila	mapper	yes, I mean reconfigure slave, create new configuration for the zones pointing to the right files, and not the dev and test zones point to dev file
2009-08-21T13:35:00.000Z	fvila	mapper	anyway, I don't have a deep knowledge on bind
2009-08-21T13:36:00.000Z	mapper	fvila	ok, I was trying to avoid using tcpdump, to see if there would an easy way .. Thanks anyway ..
2009-08-21T13:36:00.000Z	fvila	mapper	no problem, and sorry (and good luck!)
