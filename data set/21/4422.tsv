2011-11-28T01:16:00.000Z	thegreyspot		HI! I was having problems wiht my wifi card (signal was way too low) so I did some stuff, but now I dont even see the wireless device in network manager
2011-11-28T01:16:00.000Z	thegreyspot		I am running ubuntu 11.10
2011-11-28T01:16:00.000Z	thegreyspot		I blacked listed some drivers, however I have removed those again and restarted
2011-11-28T01:16:00.000Z	vergil	thegreyspot	Do you recall what the device was named?
2011-11-28T01:17:00.000Z	thegreyspot	vergil	Um, I guess not? YOu mean like wlan0?
2011-11-28T01:17:00.000Z	vergil	thegreyspot	I'd check to see if it still shows in ifconfig. Yes - like wlan0
2011-11-28T01:17:00.000Z	vergil	thegreyspot	You can also use the iw* tools perhaps - iwevent can show you what's going on etc.
2011-11-28T01:18:00.000Z	vergil	thegreyspot	I'm assuming you don't get anything back when you try a reboot (I hate suggesting reboots, but this case it might be quickest)
2011-11-28T01:19:00.000Z	thegreyspot	vergil	Ya iwconfig reports no wireless extensions
2011-11-28T01:19:00.000Z	thegreyspot	vergil	i have restarted a bunch of times :)
2011-11-28T01:19:00.000Z	vergil	thegreyspot	That's kind of strange - nothing is coming to mind off the top of my head - do you remember the kernel module that your wireless would want to use?
2011-11-28T01:20:00.000Z	vergil	thegreyspot	i.e. atheros, broadcom etc.
2011-11-28T01:20:00.000Z	thegreyspot	vergil	definitely broadcom I have 4313
2011-11-28T01:20:00.000Z	vergil	thegreyspot	I'd run lsmod to see if you even have the driver loading
2011-11-28T01:21:00.000Z	vergil	thegreyspot	I don't remember the module name off the top of my head, but you might also try to use modprobe to insert it
2011-11-28T01:21:00.000Z	vergil	thegreyspot	Something like: sudo modprobe bcm4313  # change the name to match the acutal module
2011-11-28T01:22:00.000Z	vergil	thegreyspot	Unfortunately I stopped memorizing modules :)
2011-11-28T01:22:00.000Z	vergil		bbiab
2011-11-28T01:23:00.000Z	thegreyspot	vergil	I dont see the module in lsmod :/ Its definitely enabled
2011-11-28T01:28:00.000Z	thegreyspot	vergil	I even installed windows driver with ndiswrapper just to see if i can get it recognized but I still didnt get anything after a restart
2011-11-28T01:28:00.000Z	thegreyspot	vergil	I want to reload the brcm80211 drivers for the device, just not sure how
