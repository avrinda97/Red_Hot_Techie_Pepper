2006-08-24T10:53:00.000Z	kling0n		how can i force uninstall a package even if the prereq script fails?
2006-08-24T10:54:00.000Z	eyequeue	kling0n	dpkg --force-help
2006-08-24T10:56:00.000Z	kling0n	eyequeue	tried a dpkg --purge --force-all but still fails due to the preconfig scripts failing
2006-08-24T10:57:00.000Z	eyequeue	kling0n	pre-rm you mean?
2006-08-24T10:57:00.000Z	kling0n	eyequeue	yes
2006-08-24T10:57:00.000Z	eyequeue	kling0n	sec ...
2006-08-24T10:58:00.000Z	eyequeue	kling0n	/var/lib/dpkg/info/foo.prerm
2006-08-24T10:59:00.000Z	eyequeue	kling0n	run the lines of it manually with sudo, then rm the file itself
2006-08-24T10:59:00.000Z	eyequeue	kling0n	the the removal should work
2006-08-24T10:59:00.000Z	kling0n	eyequeue	got it
2006-08-24T10:59:00.000Z	kling0n	eyequeue	thanks
2006-08-24T11:00:00.000Z	kling0n	eyequeue	 thnx... worked
2006-08-24T11:00:00.000Z	eyequeue	kling0n	np ... if you find out what barfs in the prerm, consider filing a bug report too
2006-08-24T11:00:00.000Z	kling0n	eyequeue	im kinda stuck in the middle cause I upgraded to edgy... :)
2006-08-24T11:00:00.000Z	kling0n	eyequeue	my system is *VERY* non standard atrm :)
2006-08-24T11:01:00.000Z	eyequeue	kling0n	ahh.  you do know about #ubuntu+1, right? :)
2006-08-24T11:03:00.000Z	kling0n	eyequeue	wasnt aware that it would be this extensive though :) ive been running bleeding edge before (bsd, not ubuntu) but i guess there is more to it than i had been planning after... :) dpkg-reconfigure is my friends right now though
2006-08-24T11:03:00.000Z	eyequeue	kling0n	it gets easier later in the development cycle, generally, but yes, it;s not for the faint-of-heart
2006-08-24T11:04:00.000Z	kling0n	eyequeue	my main prob is, im much better at the prompt than in the desktop environment.... I have no idea what happened to my gnome :)
2006-08-24T11:05:00.000Z	eyequeue	kling0n	yeah, i fing guis confusing as well
2006-08-24T11:09:00.000Z	kling0n	eyequeue	I think next time i will make me a separate install of the bleeding edge :) or maybe run it in qemu :)
