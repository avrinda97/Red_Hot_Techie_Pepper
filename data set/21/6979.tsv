2007-03-04T09:36:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	gar	run FC on what?
2007-07-14T15:25:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	gar	could be any number of reasons.
2007-07-14T15:26:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	gar	well, if you're wanting to install, use the alternate Install CD... its textbased, and should get you installed.
2007-07-14T15:26:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	gar	are you sure your burns are good?
2007-07-14T15:27:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	gar	seems fine... well, that tells me you don't know.   i'd try burning it again, and burn it SLOW.. like around 2-4x
2007-07-14T15:28:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	gar	are you wanting to install Ubuntu to an external drive?
2007-07-14T15:28:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	gar	then for whatgever reason, you PC is goofed up on it.
2007-07-14T15:28:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	gar	well, if you're installing to an external USB drive, i'd HIGHLY recommend the alternate install CD.. ive never had luck with using the live CD to install to a usb drive
2007-07-14T15:29:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	gar	well, ubuntu isn't knoppix
2007-07-14T15:34:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	gar	no.. but its still quite easy
2007-07-14T15:34:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	gar	that doesn't matter
2007-07-14T15:35:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	gar	you're wanting to install Ubuntu, correct?
