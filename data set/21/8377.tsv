2006-04-19T10:20:00.000Z	DBO	lone_marauder	thats not entirely true, NAT provides limited protection
2006-04-19T10:20:00.000Z	lone_marauder	DBO	- his ISP won't route spoofed packets
2006-04-19T10:21:00.000Z	lone_marauder	DBO	if you're concerned about security, rsync is a nightmare.
2006-04-19T10:21:00.000Z	DBO	lone_marauder	not on a local network
2006-04-19T10:22:00.000Z	lone_marauder	DBO	My bad - I thought you were recomending rsync as a security enhancement.
2006-04-19T10:22:00.000Z	DBO	lone_marauder	no no, for security I would pipe it all through SSH
2006-04-19T10:22:00.000Z	lone_marauder	DBO	absolutely
2006-04-19T10:26:00.000Z	DBO	lone_marauder	a properly setup IDS would remove that requirement as it would filter that for you
2006-04-19T10:27:00.000Z	lone_marauder	DBO	No, it would just tell you after the fact that it happened.  Or are you talking about IDP?
2006-04-19T10:28:00.000Z	DBO	lone_marauder	snort can do it, and yes, IDP and IDS kind of go hand in hand...
2006-04-19T10:28:00.000Z	lone_marauder	DBO	- I guess maybe in snort land.  In the commercial workd, that P costs about another $20,000  :)
2006-04-19T10:29:00.000Z	DBO	lone_marauder	for a hardware gig... which you would never deploy at home... and would handle about 20,000 times the bandwidth you would ever see...
2006-04-19T10:30:00.000Z	lone_marauder	DBO	- are you talking about snort?
2006-04-19T10:30:00.000Z	DBO	lone_marauder	yes
2006-04-19T10:31:00.000Z	lone_marauder	DBO	- cool.  I haven't looked at snort in a couple of years.  I've been meaning to see how the project is going.
2006-04-19T10:32:00.000Z	DBO	lone_marauder	it can handle all of the traffic of a small college on a relatively modest box (actually 3 boxes doing different segments with different rules) with ease
2006-04-19T10:32:00.000Z	lone_marauder	DBO	- Yeah, it has always been a hardcore packet snarfer, but I didn't know how far you could push the new IDP features.
2006-04-19T10:33:00.000Z	lone_marauder	DBO	- we used to use it when we needed a line rate reliable sniffer.
2006-04-19T10:34:00.000Z	DBO	lone_marauder	the IDP aspect has really picked up lately, give it a run.  You can also write your own in-house stuff pretty easy
2006-04-19T10:34:00.000Z	lone_marauder	DBO	- cool.
2006-04-19T11:24:00.000Z	DBO	lone_marauder	yeah, we already went over that =)
