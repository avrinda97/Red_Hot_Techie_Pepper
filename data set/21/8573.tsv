2006-03-14T09:44:00.000Z	crusso		Anyone successful installing Ubuntu on an Apple clamshell iBook?  I'm experiencing the oft-reported "nothing happens, black screen on login" problem... I haven't found any solutions to it.
2006-03-14T09:45:00.000Z	nalioth	crusso	have you tried "server install" ?
2006-03-14T09:45:00.000Z	crusso	nalioth	no... I haven't tried it or seen that suggestion.
2006-03-14T09:47:00.000Z	nalioth	crusso	the clamshell is kinda old, i recommend either gaining a terminal in your current setup and installing xubuntu-desktop, or reinstalling the server-install and then installing xubuntu-desktop
2006-03-14T09:48:00.000Z	crusso	nalioth	when you say "gaining a terminal", do you mean just using the clamshell as a terminal?
2006-03-14T09:48:00.000Z	nalioth	crusso	is your clamshell running now? at the 'black screen' ?
2006-03-14T09:49:00.000Z	crusso	nalioth	put it in the closet.  getting it now
2006-03-14T10:03:00.000Z	crusso	nalioth	Okay, booted up the clamshell and tried to log in... I heard the login tune, but now the screen is black.
2006-03-14T10:04:00.000Z	nalioth	crusso	type ctrl-alt-f2 and see if you can get a terminal
2006-03-14T10:05:00.000Z	nalioth	crusso	from the terminal, type "sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop" if you are running (or tried to install) breezy
2006-03-14T10:07:00.000Z	crusso	nalioth	says it can't find a "xubuntu-desktop"... however "ubuntu-desktop" it knows about and says I already have the latest version.
2006-03-14T10:08:00.000Z	nalioth	crusso	type 'cat /etc/issue' and let me know if it says anything
2006-03-14T10:09:00.000Z	crusso	nalioth	"Ubuntu 5.10 "Breezy Badger" \n \l
2006-03-14T10:09:00.000Z	nalioth	crusso	use nano from your terminal to enable universe and multiverse on your clamshell (see the PM ubotu just sent)
2006-03-14T10:10:00.000Z	nalioth	crusso	is your clamshell connected to the net right now?
2006-03-14T10:10:00.000Z	crusso	nalioth	Okay.  Thanks for the help.
2006-03-14T10:10:00.000Z	crusso	nalioth	yes, it is
2006-03-14T10:10:00.000Z	nalioth	crusso	once you enable universe and multiverse, run "sudo apt-get update"
2006-03-14T10:16:00.000Z	crusso	nalioth	Unfortunately, those guides all use GUI... which I don't have at the moment.  I'm googling for how to do the same thing without the GUI.  (looks like you're busy. :)
2006-03-14T10:16:00.000Z	nalioth	crusso	join me in #kubuntu-offtopic please
