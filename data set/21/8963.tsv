2011-07-19T23:39:00.000Z	Spikestuff		Hi. I recently installed Ubuntu 11.04 using Wubi on a partition next to Windows on my laptop, I want to rid the Windows and other partitions so that only Ubuntu exists, I don't wish to save any files on the other partitions. Am I able to do this?
2011-07-19T23:40:00.000Z	Spikestuff		Linux or Windoze. The chose is tuff. :p
2011-07-19T23:42:00.000Z	Spikestuff		Well I can't boot from an install CD because this laptop was given to me and the previous owner does not remember the BIOS password, so I can't change the boot priority to boot from CD. I have tried to simply insert a CD/DVD with the Ubuntu ISO file on it and let the computer boot up, but it just goes to the Boot Manager and lets me choose between Windows and Ubuntu.
2011-07-19T23:42:00.000Z	Spikestuff		I just want a true install, no Windows.
2011-07-19T23:42:00.000Z	Spikestuff		That's why I used Wubi, to circumvent the BIOS. :(
2011-07-19T23:42:00.000Z	Spikestuff		I am just wondering if I can wipe everything through the Ubuntu partition and just leave Ubuntu.
2011-07-19T23:43:00.000Z	dli	Spikestuff	can you get grub2 on hard drive? you can boot cd with grub
2011-07-19T23:44:00.000Z	dli	Spikestuff	is the laptop a thinkpad?
2011-07-19T23:45:00.000Z	dli	Spikestuff	because thinkpad has encryption chip on mobo, no way to recover passwd
2011-07-19T23:45:00.000Z	dli	Spikestuff	can you get grub?
2011-07-19T23:49:00.000Z	dli	Spikestuff	if you don't want to dig much with grub, try a boot manager like this: http://www.plop.at/en/bootmanagerdl.html
2011-07-19T23:49:00.000Z	dli	Spikestuff	basically, you add plpbt.bin to grub, then, select it from grub when booting, and plpbt.bin will run as boot manager, and allows you to boot from USB/CD-ROM, etc.
2011-07-19T23:51:00.000Z	dli	Spikestuff	grub2 can do it all :( like booting from USB, even if your BIOS doesn't support USB booting
2011-07-19T23:57:00.000Z	dli	Spikestuff	boot ubuntu first?
2011-07-19T23:58:00.000Z	dli	Spikestuff	another way, you can boot .iso from grub2 without burning the CDs
2011-07-19T23:58:00.000Z	dli	Spikestuff	for grub2, http://members.iinet.net/~herman546/p20/GRUB2%20CLI%20Mode%20Commands.html#cli_loopback
2011-07-20T00:26:00.000Z	dli	Spikestuff	you have edit grub files also :(
2011-07-20T00:27:00.000Z	dli	Spikestuff	something like /etc/grub.d/40_custom
2011-07-20T00:31:00.000Z	dli	Spikestuff	http://paste.pocoo.org/show/442442/
2011-07-20T00:34:00.000Z	dli	Spikestuff	depends on your location
2011-07-20T00:35:00.000Z	dli	Spikestuff	it's /boot/grub/ then
