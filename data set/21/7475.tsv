2006-09-25T11:06:00.000Z	Dr_willis		see qcad is 'professional' :P
2006-09-25T11:06:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Dr_willis	pythoncad has a longer name. :P
2006-09-25T11:08:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Dr_willis	then I'm guessing it's abandoned.
2006-09-25T11:09:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ArrenLex	 that would be my guess also.

2006-09-28T08:37:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Dr_willis	why? xD I had ten operating systems installed, 15 partitions, on my 40GB on my old computer, and was not pressed for space.
2006-09-28T08:37:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ArrenLex	 Emulators mainly :P
2006-10-05T06:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ArrenLex	 seen them used in an automated way to make a 'animation' of some task. :P
2006-10-05T06:49:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Dr_willis	well sure, but that doesn't seem to be what he's after.
2006-10-05T11:10:00.000Z	ArrenLex	Dr_willis	I find that the safest way to symlink things is to put the whole path.
