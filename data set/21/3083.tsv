2009-04-18T10:40:00.000Z	Nemes		let me try it
2009-04-18T10:42:00.000Z	roadmap	Nemes	 what kind of regex do you need written?
2009-04-18T10:43:00.000Z	Nemes	roadmap	to match all the lines that only contain # followed by a number
2009-04-18T10:43:00.000Z	Nemes	roadmap	something like ^[:whitespace:]*#[0-9]*[:whitespace:]*
2009-04-18T10:45:00.000Z	roadmap	Nemes	 why POSIX?
2009-04-18T10:46:00.000Z	roadmap	Nemes	 Why not ^\s*#[0-9]*\s* ?
2009-04-18T10:47:00.000Z	Nemes	roadmap	why not?
2009-04-18T10:47:00.000Z	roadmap	Nemes	 I've just never been a fan of POSIX in my regex.
2009-04-18T10:48:00.000Z	roadmap	Nemes	 Say you're writing something in code (oh perl?) and you're trying to match a regex, if you do like if($var =~ <insert posix stuff here>) it would get pretty lengthy on one line
2009-04-18T10:49:00.000Z	roadmap	Nemes	 Maybe its just the perl scripter in me that doesn't like POSIX :).
2009-04-18T10:50:00.000Z	roadmap	Nemes	 you new to Regex?
2009-04-18T10:50:00.000Z	Nemes	roadmap	pretty much
2009-04-18T10:51:00.000Z	roadmap	Nemes	 Give this a shot http://www.addedbytes.com/cheat-sheets/regular-expressions-cheat-sheet-version-1/ its V1. I prefer it over the V2 Cheat Sheet.
2009-04-18T10:51:00.000Z	roadmap	Nemes	 Heres V2 http://www.addedbytes.com/cheat-sheets/regular-expressions-cheat-sheet/ - use whatever suits you best.
2009-04-18T10:51:00.000Z	Nemes	roadmap	thanks,
2009-04-18T10:52:00.000Z	roadmap	Nemes	 No problem. I use regex all the time and I still forget what needs to be escaped every now and then. Those sheets pay off to have laying around.
2009-04-18T10:52:00.000Z	Nemes	roadmap	now I won't use POSIX, you're corrupting the youth!
2009-04-18T10:52:00.000Z	roadmap	Nemes	 I think the youth corrupted me :).
2009-04-18T10:52:00.000Z	Nemes	roadmap	probably :P
2009-04-18T11:07:00.000Z	Nemes	roadmap	the cheat sheets are amazing!)
2009-04-18T11:07:00.000Z	roadmap	Nemes	 Im glad I managed to help.
