2010-05-13T11:04:00.000Z	pallgone	adante	I wonder if network manager might be messing with it...

2010-05-13T11:05:00.000Z	pallgone	adante	?
2010-05-13T11:05:00.000Z	adante	pallgone	good point, i have been running about 4000 instances of gnome-session, and i just did a ps and there were about 20 instances of gnome-keyring-daemon (now killed)
2010-05-13T11:06:00.000Z	adante	pallgone	will try that later, folks are losing network atm
2010-05-13T11:06:00.000Z	pallgone	adante	it's on a server?
2010-05-13T11:06:00.000Z	adante	pallgone	yep
