2007-10-20T17:20:00.000Z	k3ks		hi, i've got problems after upgrading to gutsy, gdm doesn't start, gnome also doesn't and any other gnome application does also not start
2007-10-20T17:20:00.000Z	k3ks		hi oetzi
2007-10-20T17:21:00.000Z	k3ks		i get following message if i like to start agnome application symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/libgdk-x11-2.0.so.0: undefined symbol: g_once_init_enter_impl
2007-10-20T17:22:00.000Z	k3ks		it seems to be a problem with glib causee if i want to dpkg-rconfigure gdm i get This build of Glib was compiled with glib 2.14.0, but is currently running with 2.13.1, which is too old
2007-10-20T17:24:00.000Z	jrib	k3ks	current glib version in gutsy is 2.14
2007-10-20T17:24:00.000Z	k3ks	jrib	i have 2.14.1 installed
2007-10-20T17:24:00.000Z	jrib	k3ks	do you have stuff in /usr/local/ perhaps?
2007-10-20T17:25:00.000Z	k3ks	jrib	in /user/local/lib, yes
2007-10-20T17:25:00.000Z	k3ks	jrib	is that the problm?
2007-10-20T17:26:00.000Z	jrib	k3ks	maybe
2007-10-20T17:26:00.000Z	jrib	k3ks	what do you have in there?
2007-10-20T17:27:00.000Z	k3ks	jrib	http://pastebin.ca/743403
2007-10-20T17:28:00.000Z	jrib	k3ks	yes, i would say that's probably the problem then
2007-10-20T17:28:00.000Z	k3ks	jrib	so rename them?
2007-10-20T17:28:00.000Z	jrib	k3ks	why do you need them at all?
2007-10-20T17:28:00.000Z	k3ks	jrib	don't know, i didn't put them there
2007-10-20T17:29:00.000Z	jrib	k3ks	stuff in /usr/local/ has to be created by the user.  The package manager does not touch that location
2007-10-20T17:31:00.000Z	k3ks	jrib	k, but it wasn't me too, but thanks a lot that seems to be the problem!
2007-10-20T17:31:00.000Z	k3ks	jrib	gdmjust started!
2007-10-20T17:31:00.000Z	jrib	k3ks	great
2007-10-20T17:34:00.000Z	k3ks	jrib	thanks! gnoem works again, seems a bit broken but i think i'll get it now! thanks a lot
