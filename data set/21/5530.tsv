2008-03-05T17:22:00.000Z	bazhang	krept`	what adapter--what chipset do you have; built in or usb dongle
2008-03-05T17:23:00.000Z	bazhang	krept`	are you at that machine now?
2008-03-05T17:26:00.000Z	krept`	bazhang	the driver disk only has exe files
2008-03-05T17:27:00.000Z	bazhang	krept`	can you get a live cd on that machine or is ubuntu already installed on it
2008-03-05T17:28:00.000Z	bazhang	krept`	could you tell me the exact name in lspci?
2008-03-05T17:29:00.000Z	bazhang	krept`	that seems like an ethernet device; is there no name for the wireless one? what does ifconfig say in the terminal
2008-03-05T17:32:00.000Z	bazhang	krept`	it may be that it is identifying your network wireless card as an ethernet card--the eth0avah entry it would seem
2008-03-05T17:33:00.000Z	bazhang	krept`	any info on the box that the computer came in or the specs on what that card is? (ie the exact name)?
2008-03-05T17:35:00.000Z	bazhang	krept`	well you can try to use ndiswrapper but it would be better to use the native linux (if there any) drivers
2008-03-05T17:36:00.000Z	bazhang	krept`	if you checked the pdf that would be great
2008-03-05T17:43:00.000Z	krept`	bazhang	 what exactly am i looking for in the manual?
2008-03-05T17:44:00.000Z	bazhang	krept`	is there a web address?
2008-03-05T17:46:00.000Z	bazhang	krept`	heh well just tell me the make and model of the computer and I will check it
2008-03-05T17:48:00.000Z	bazhang	krept`	just a sec
2008-03-05T17:53:00.000Z	bazhang	krept`	seems that is the broadcom 43xx
2008-03-05T17:55:00.000Z	bazhang	krept`	there is a how to above
2008-03-05T17:56:00.000Z	bazhang	krept`	some have reported success that way--others have done the ndiswrapper trick
2008-03-05T22:29:00.000Z	krept`	bazhang	i went and bought a new card
