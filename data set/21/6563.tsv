2007-07-28T14:16:00.000Z	joe4444		anyone know how to get AVN to stay on top all the time even with auto-hide on?  sometimes it will remain on top so when i get a new IM the buddy icon bounces up to let me know (i can see the top 1/3 of the icon as it bounces), but often it is not on top so even though the buddy icon bounces i can't see it b/c it's behind a maximized window
2007-07-28T14:17:00.000Z	joe4444		avant window navigator =p
2007-07-28T14:17:00.000Z	jowi	joe4444	i think there is a setting for it in gconf-editor
2007-07-28T14:18:00.000Z	joe4444	jowi	any idea what i should search for?  also, would it have any effect if i'm using Beryl (required by AVN i think, but i'd use it anyway)?
2007-07-28T14:19:00.000Z	jowi	joe4444	/apps/avant-window-navigator. i just checked though. i was mistaken. it should always be on top....
2007-07-28T14:19:00.000Z	joe4444	jowi	so it's probably just a bug?
2007-07-28T14:19:00.000Z	jowi	joe4444	which window manager are you using? with beryl you can force. not sure about metacity (default for gnome)
2007-07-28T14:20:00.000Z	joe4444		i can't figure out when it stays on top and when it doesn't, but more often than not it doesn't stay on top
2007-07-28T14:20:00.000Z	joe4444	jowi	emerald
2007-07-28T14:20:00.000Z	jowi	joe4444	wait, i check my settings on the other computer
2007-07-28T14:20:00.000Z	joe4444		k, thanks
2007-07-28T14:21:00.000Z	joe4444	jowi	i meant my window manager is Beryl... window decorator is Emerald
2007-07-28T14:24:00.000Z	jowi	joe4444	i understood you. i'm not using gnome so i don't know if it is possible to do this. I noticed the same thing though and it took me awhile to remember what i did. i set a "sleep 2" in my startup script before avn is launched. didn't find option for it in beryl...
2007-07-28T14:25:00.000Z	jowi	joe4444	if you use gnome maybe you can use your session manager to set a sleep/delay before avn is launched.
2007-07-28T14:25:00.000Z	joe4444	jowi	did the "sleep 2" thing fix it?  if so, where do i put that?
2007-07-28T14:26:00.000Z	jowi	joe4444	if you use gnome you should use gnome session manager if you can. i don't use gnome so my .xsession file has simply a "sleep 2" line before "avant-window-navigator &"
2007-07-28T14:27:00.000Z	jowi	joe4444	i run beryl stand-alone.
2007-07-28T14:27:00.000Z	jowi	joe4444	probably a bug in either avn or beryl i would say. but the sleep fixed it for me.
2007-07-28T14:27:00.000Z	joe4444	jowi	the session manager only allows me to specify a command... should i just do "sleep 2; avant-window-manager" ?
2007-07-28T14:28:00.000Z	jowi	joe4444	you can always try. i'm no good with gnome.
2007-07-28T14:28:00.000Z	joe4444	jowi	ok i'll see if that helps... thanks for the tip
