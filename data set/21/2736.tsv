2009-07-06T15:47:00.000Z	indus		people trying to argue about whats right and whats not, when all iam doing is helping someone
2009-07-06T15:47:00.000Z	indus		i repeat again to the ops and to others . dont force your point down my throat
2009-07-06T15:49:00.000Z	indus		so we are even
2009-07-06T15:51:00.000Z	indus		so whats the preferred client for irc then ??
2009-07-06T15:51:00.000Z	indus		seriously, is there anything better?
2009-07-06T15:52:00.000Z	richardcavell_	indus	I don't necessarily prefer xchat to chatzilla
2009-07-20T15:58:00.000Z	indus	richardcavell_	iam guessing, i copy the iso to usb then boot from usb?
2009-07-20T15:59:00.000Z	richardcavell_	indus	don't copy the iso to the usb
2009-07-20T15:59:00.000Z	richardcavell_	indus	you 'burn' it to the usb
2009-07-20T15:59:00.000Z	indus	richardcavell_	huh what? how?
2009-07-20T16:02:00.000Z	indus	richardcavell_	how do you burn it to usb?
2009-07-20T16:03:00.000Z	richardcavell_	indus	it is possible.  Easier to burn it to CD and then copy it to usb
2009-07-20T16:03:00.000Z	indus	richardcavell_	u mean just copying an iso to usb will not work?
2009-07-20T16:03:00.000Z	richardcavell_	indus	it will not work
2009-07-20T16:04:00.000Z	richardcavell_	indus	the .iso file is an image.  That image has to be imprinted somehow onto the medium
2009-07-20T16:05:00.000Z	indus	richardcavell_	hmm no,actually the usb stick needs a grub kinda thing loaded onto it
2009-07-20T16:05:00.000Z	indus	richardcavell_	i guess thats why its a little diff
2009-07-20T16:06:00.000Z	richardcavell_	indus	some computers can boot from a usb stick.  Most can.
2009-07-20T16:06:00.000Z	indus	richardcavell_	best is to use usb-creator
2009-07-20T16:08:00.000Z	indus	richardcavell_	the usb disk can only be created from a running linux os,or use netbootin in windows
2009-07-30T15:27:00.000Z	richardcavell_	indus	Can use C++ in eclipse
