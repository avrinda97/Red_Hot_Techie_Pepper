2006-07-30T13:25:00.000Z	Maciek		I have Dapper Drake and I have a little problem - When I am watching movies in Totem everything is okay, but in fullscreen it really sucks (sorry for my english, but I'm from Poland)
2006-07-30T13:25:00.000Z	crocz	Maciek	really sucks ?
2006-07-30T13:25:00.000Z	crocz	Maciek	could you be a little more specific ?
2006-07-30T13:25:00.000Z	Maciek	crocz	I don't know how to say this
2006-07-30T13:26:00.000Z	crocz		Hmm, slow?
2006-07-30T13:26:00.000Z	Maciek		there's too little frames per second
2006-07-30T13:27:00.000Z	crocz	Maciek	ah ok. Do you have accel on?
2006-07-30T13:27:00.000Z	crocz	Maciek	have you also tried Mplayer?
2006-07-30T13:27:00.000Z	Maciek		I don't know, I have S3Savage8 graphic card
2006-07-30T13:29:00.000Z	crocz	Maciek	hehe I suck when it comes to non-nvidia cards, but may be you need to install DRI and libmesa
2006-07-30T13:29:00.000Z	crocz	Maciek	If I remember well those should  get Direct Rendering going.
2006-07-30T13:29:00.000Z	Maciek	crocz	I'll try install libmesa
2006-07-30T13:32:00.000Z	Maciek	crocz	I tried to use gstreamer in Totem instead xine, but it hadn't opened rmvb movie
2006-07-30T13:33:00.000Z	crocz	Maciek	am using totem-xine with the gstreamers codecs / libs installed
2006-07-30T13:33:00.000Z	crocz	Maciek	but usually I simply use Mplayer ..
2006-07-30T13:34:00.000Z	Maciek	crocz	in mplayer effect is the same like in Totem
2006-07-30T13:34:00.000Z	crocz	Maciek	then it's your direct rendering
2006-07-30T13:35:00.000Z	Maciek	crocz	how can I turn on Direct Rendering?
2006-07-30T13:36:00.000Z	crocz	Maciek	that is what I said earlier on. get DRI and Mesa working
2006-07-30T13:37:00.000Z	Maciek	crocz	Do I have to install any packages or configure something to enable DRI and Mesa?
2006-07-30T13:38:00.000Z	crocz	Maciek	yes.. I guess .. like I said though ... I such when it comes to non-nvidia cards
