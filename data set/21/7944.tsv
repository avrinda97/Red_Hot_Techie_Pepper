2006-07-23T15:29:00.000Z	jrib	help	but why do you want to own /home?
2006-07-23T15:31:00.000Z	jrib	help	you mounted a new drive over your existing /home?
2006-07-23T15:31:00.000Z	jrib	help	I would just reboot
2006-07-23T15:34:00.000Z	jrib	help	what do you mean you did the same thing?  What thing did you do?
2006-07-23T15:38:00.000Z	jrib	help	but when you reboot, everything should be back to normal.  Unless you edited fstab, did you do that?
2006-07-23T15:39:00.000Z	jrib	help	try to prepend my nick to your responds, otherwise I might miss them
2006-07-23T15:39:00.000Z	jrib	help	you shouldn't edit it, right now you are trying to unmount the partition you mounted to /home right?  If that's the case, just reboot
2006-07-23T15:40:00.000Z	jrib	help	after you reboot the drive won't be mounted anymore
2006-07-23T15:41:00.000Z	jrib	help	yes, that is why I am suggesting you reboot.  rebooting should unmount it for you
2006-07-23T15:42:00.000Z	jrib	help	no?  Did you reboot and it didn't work?
2006-07-23T15:43:00.000Z	jrib	help	ok can you post on pastebin the output from this command: mount && cat /etc/fstab
2006-07-23T15:45:00.000Z	jrib	help	pastebin is a site where you can post large amounts of text, the url is paste.ubuntu-nl.org .  Just put the command I gave you and then paste the output on pastebin.  After that, give us the URL for the post
2006-07-24T11:27:00.000Z	jrib	help	type 'man chown', it is the manual for the chown command.  You type commands in applications > accessories > terminal
2006-07-24T11:29:00.000Z	jrib	help	if I wanted to make the file /home/jasonr/notex.txt owned by the user 'jrib', I would type: sudo chown jrib:jrib /home/jasonr/notes.txt
