2010-06-21T23:27:00.000Z	dopple		no
2010-06-21T23:27:00.000Z	dopple		i just installed karmic and that thing doesnt come up... all those things are under the ubuntu logo in the top left screen
2010-06-21T23:28:00.000Z	dopple		sigh
2010-06-21T23:29:00.000Z	dopple		ok.. when i installed lucid... when i booted up, what i saw on the screen was more or less like a launcher for apps... when i installed karmic.. thats all accessible by clicking the ubuntu logo in the top left corner, not taking up the whole screen
2010-06-21T23:30:00.000Z	dopple		although karmic is still being laggy as hell with screen updates so i might just be scrapping the whole ubuntu idea
2010-06-21T23:31:00.000Z	Svartalf	dopple	Might I suggest turning off Compiz?
2010-06-21T23:31:00.000Z	dopple		svartalf: sure you can suggest that... what is it? :)
2010-06-21T23:32:00.000Z	dopple		svartalf: suggest anything you like... you just might have to explain what it is ;-)
2010-06-21T23:32:00.000Z	Svartalf	dopple	It's the compositing manager (meaning special effects...eyecandy) for Ubuntu.  It uses OpenGL aggressively and if you've got less than a mid-end card or higher, it's going to possibly feel laggy.
2010-06-21T23:33:00.000Z	Svartalf	dopple	Try going to System->Preferences->Appearance in your menus on the desktop, it will bring up a pop-up with tabs.
2010-06-21T23:34:00.000Z	dopple		svartalf: system?
2010-06-21T23:34:00.000Z	Svartalf	dopple	If you click on the "Visual Effects" tab, it'll move to it.
2010-06-21T23:34:00.000Z	Svartalf	dopple	Yeah, the system menu, sub menu preferences, item Appearance.
2010-06-21T23:35:00.000Z	dopple		svartalf: got ya...
2010-06-21T23:35:00.000Z	dopple		worms: no i havent solved that.... but if i cant get this to stop being so laggy im just gonna remove it :(
2010-06-21T23:35:00.000Z	Svartalf		Once you've got the Visual Effects tab selected, click "None" to turn it off.  If it's already in "None", don't know what to tell you unless I've got more info for you.
2010-06-21T23:35:00.000Z	Svartalf		er, from...
2010-06-21T23:36:00.000Z	dopple		svartalf: yah visual effects are off :(
2010-06-21T23:36:00.000Z	dopple		ive never known linux to be slower than windows....
2010-06-21T23:37:00.000Z	dopple	askhader	hmm??
2010-06-21T23:37:00.000Z	Svartalf	dopple	 Shouldn't be- my stuff isn't like that and I'm running against all sort of goofball hardware.
