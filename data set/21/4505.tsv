2008-07-19T08:43:00.000Z	Sitherae		I'm trying to install Pidgin from source and I get this error with I try to "make" it: make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.
2008-07-19T08:44:00.000Z	arvind_k	Sitherae	why do you want to compile
2008-07-19T08:44:00.000Z	Sitherae	arvind_k	Heard compiling from source is the only way to get MSN/Gtalk to work.
2008-07-19T08:44:00.000Z	arvind_k	Sitherae	wrong info!!!
2008-07-19T08:48:00.000Z	arvind_k	Sitherae	you need to install gnu-tls and then recompile!!!
2008-07-19T08:48:00.000Z	Sitherae	arvind_k	Can't find that package :\
2008-07-19T08:49:00.000Z	arvind_k	Sitherae	hang on
2008-07-19T08:50:00.000Z	arvind_k	Sitherae	that is libgnutls and install its -dev too ... that would be sudo apt-get install libgnutls libgnutls-dev
2008-07-19T08:51:00.000Z	arvind_k	Sitherae	hey sorry there is only -dev just install that
2008-07-19T08:52:00.000Z	Sitherae	arvind_k	Alright got it. But now pidgin isn't compiling :(
2008-07-19T08:53:00.000Z	Sitherae	arvind_k	Getting this error: make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.
2008-07-19T08:53:00.000Z	arvind_k	Sitherae	i think you should just install from the repo...it has got no problems
2008-07-19T08:54:00.000Z	Sitherae	arvind_k	That did not fix the SSL problem :\
2008-07-19T08:54:00.000Z	arvind_k	Sitherae	first uninstall the compiled version
2008-07-19T08:55:00.000Z	Sitherae	arvind_k	Using Synaptic?
2008-07-19T08:56:00.000Z	arvind_k	Sitherae	no use sudo make uninstall ...assuming that you had successfuly installed/compiled it
2008-07-19T08:56:00.000Z	Sitherae	arvind_k	I never installed it LOL
2008-07-19T08:56:00.000Z	Sitherae	arvind_k	Kept getting errors with compiling
2008-07-19T08:57:00.000Z	arvind_k	Sitherae	then delete the source and use synaptic to install pidgin
2008-07-19T09:00:00.000Z	arvind_k	Sitherae	murlidhar, there is a power cut here ...gotta go... sorry ...
