2009-03-16T09:02:00.000Z	phasegen		Can using underscores "blah_blah" in a directory, or a file name cause problems in ubuntu?
2009-03-16T09:02:00.000Z	bruce89	phasegen	not if you escape them
2009-03-16T09:03:00.000Z	phasegen	bruce89	explain
2009-03-16T09:03:00.000Z	bruce89	phasegen	example\ file\ name
2009-03-16T09:04:00.000Z	bruce89	phasegen	means you don't need underscores, you can just use spaces
2009-03-16T09:05:00.000Z	phasegen	bruce89	what if I downloaded a program that has them all through it?  Directories and filenames...
2009-03-16T09:06:00.000Z	phasegen		so I would have to rewrite the internals on this program...
2009-03-16T09:07:00.000Z	phasegen		sweet
2009-03-16T09:07:00.000Z	bruce89	phasegen	what do you mean?
2009-03-16T09:08:00.000Z	phasegen	bruce89	this program is pcgen from sourceforge
2009-03-16T09:09:00.000Z	bruce89	phasegen	and the problem is?
2009-03-16T09:09:00.000Z	phasegen	bruce89	the config files all have underscores pointing to directories with underscores in the names, and files with the same...
2009-03-16T09:10:00.000Z	bruce89	phasegen	and?
2009-03-16T09:11:00.000Z	phasegen		it won't find the sources, some of the config files, and I believe that the naming conventions might be the problem...
2009-03-16T09:12:00.000Z	phasegen	bruce89	it's written in java, with ascii config files
2009-03-16T09:13:00.000Z	bruce89		!hi
2009-03-16T09:13:00.000Z	bruce89		Python unfortunately
2009-03-16T09:14:00.000Z	phasegen	bruce89	to install the program, all you do is unzip it into a directory...  nothing is system generated
2009-03-16T09:14:00.000Z	bruce89	phasegen	why on earth is the subversion trunk of that project got a capital T?
2009-03-16T09:15:00.000Z	phasegen	bruce89	I don't know, but I think I may have to rewrite every config file in it.
2009-03-16T09:15:00.000Z	bruce89	phasegen	hmm
