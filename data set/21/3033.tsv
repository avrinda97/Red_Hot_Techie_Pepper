2009-05-02T04:27:00.000Z	coleys	Hiro2	Just Don't make a partition, keep 'your new' partition as free space... then use Guided install usinging the largest continuous free space.
2009-05-02T04:29:00.000Z	Hiro2	coleys	that's what I did
2009-05-02T04:29:00.000Z	coleys	Hiro2	And what is your problem?
2009-05-02T04:29:00.000Z	coleys	Hiro2	Do it that way this time.
2009-05-02T04:29:00.000Z	Hiro2	coleys	I shrank the vista partition to give 20GB of freespace, then I installed ubuntu there
2009-05-02T04:30:00.000Z	coleys	Hiro2	No, keep the free space as free space
2009-05-02T04:31:00.000Z	Hiro2	coleys	what for? I got 100GB free space, can't I add the new created free space partition of 20GB in there and create another partition using ubuntu CD from 120GB of free space?
2009-05-02T04:31:00.000Z	coleys	Hiro2	Then install ubuntu using LiveCD ... Install it with the third option. 'Guided install using largest continuous free space' which is just above manually partition
2009-05-02T04:32:00.000Z	Hiro2	coleys	I will, thanks :)
2009-05-02T04:39:00.000Z	coleys	Hiro2	Use LiveCD and delete it using Partition Editor
2009-05-02T04:39:00.000Z	coleys	Hiro2	Then Just install.
2009-05-02T04:39:00.000Z	coleys	Hiro2	Np, and good luck
2009-05-02T04:58:00.000Z	coleys	Hiro2	Listen, Just go System > Administation > Partition Editor
2009-05-02T04:58:00.000Z	coleys	Hiro2	Delete the current ubuntu partition, whichwill have a swawp
2009-05-02T04:59:00.000Z	Hiro2	coleys	not from the CD?
2009-05-02T04:59:00.000Z	coleys	Hiro2	From the CD
2009-05-02T04:59:00.000Z	coleys	Hiro2	Then after you delete while in Live CD just install
2009-05-02T05:00:00.000Z	coleys	Hiro2	Go on your liveCD and use pidgin for irc and come here, and ill walk you through it
2009-05-02T05:00:00.000Z	Hiro2	coleys	use the ubuntu to run ubuntu within the CD? or go through the installation process from the CD to remove it?
2009-05-02T05:00:00.000Z	coleys	Hiro2	Do you have the desktop version or the alternate?
