2009-09-24T00:56:00.000Z	zopiac		how can i disable keyrings? whenever i open like various programmes it pops up a box telling me to unlock a keyring, so freaking annoying
2009-09-24T00:57:00.000Z	guntbert	zopiac	 but secure
2009-09-24T00:58:00.000Z	zopiac	guntbert	secure from what? nobody else uses this computer
2009-09-24T00:58:00.000Z	guntbert	zopiac	and nobody else has (physical) access to this computer?
2009-09-24T00:58:00.000Z	zopiac	guntbert	no
2009-09-24T00:59:00.000Z	guntbert	zopiac	computers can be stolen though...
2009-09-24T00:59:00.000Z	zopiac	guntbert	and if they did, they wouldnt be able to do much, i have noting confidential here, pretty much just Blender 3D files and configuration stuff
2009-09-24T01:00:00.000Z	zopiac	guntbert	there hasnt been a theft in this neighbourhood for years, and we are secure against that
2009-09-24T01:00:00.000Z	guntbert	zopiac	you convinced me - you can change the password for the key ring to be empty
2009-09-24T01:01:00.000Z	zopiac	guntbert	how?
2009-09-24T01:01:00.000Z	guntbert	zopiac	open Applications/accessories/passwords and...
2009-09-24T01:03:00.000Z	guntbert	zopiac	type seahorse at the terminal
2009-09-24T01:03:00.000Z	zopiac	guntbert	but how do i change the pass to empty?
2009-09-24T01:05:00.000Z	guntbert	zopiac	I was coming to that :-) select the tab "passwords", right click on passwords:login, select "change password"
2009-09-24T01:06:00.000Z	guntbert	zopiac	you are welcome - take care :-)
2009-11-27T23:50:00.000Z	zopiac	guntbert	didnt help at all :\
2009-11-27T23:51:00.000Z	zopiac	guntbert	the link tells you how to troubleshoot problems with ./configure, but not make. there it just says 'if all goes well'
2009-11-27T23:52:00.000Z	guntbert	zopiac	first question: are you certain you need to compile it yourself?
2009-11-27T23:52:00.000Z	zopiac	guntbert	yes
2009-11-27T23:54:00.000Z	guntbert	zopiac	to me it looks like there is an error in the sources - so please ask the author
2009-11-27T23:55:00.000Z	zopiac	guntbert	well the author has put the programme on hiatus and is unavailable. It supposedly works fine, last time he checked it
