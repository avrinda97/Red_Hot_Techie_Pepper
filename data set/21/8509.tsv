2006-08-15T07:25:00.000Z	DanHowell		afternoon all
2006-08-15T07:27:00.000Z	DanHowell		I've just installed 6.06 and my laptop isn't getting on with the power management system. How can I convince ubuntu that I'm using a desktop?
2006-08-15T07:29:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	DanHowell	sudo apt-get remove --purge laptop-mode
2006-08-15T07:30:00.000Z	DanHowell	fyrestrtr	apparently laptop-mode isn't installed
2006-08-15T07:31:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	DanHowell	that's what you need then, to get the power management working.
2006-08-15T07:33:00.000Z	DanHowell	fyrestrtr	I've tried sudo apt-get install laptop-mode but the system thinks the archive is at 1.0.0.0
2006-08-15T07:33:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	DanHowell	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
2006-08-15T07:34:00.000Z	DanHowell	fyrestrtr	the terminal isn't doing the DNS lookup at all
2006-08-15T07:35:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	DanHowell	sounds like you have bigger problems. Network works?
2006-08-15T07:35:00.000Z	DanHowell		I'll leave the problem for now. thanks very much
2006-08-15T07:35:00.000Z	DanHowell	fyrestrtr	yes, and I can browse
2006-08-15T07:35:00.000Z	DanHowell		but the terminal's not picking the DNS up
2006-08-15T07:36:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	DanHowell	type dig yahoo.com
2006-08-15T07:36:00.000Z	DanHowell		I had to ping this server to give the numerical IP addy to irssi to get here in the first place
2006-08-15T07:36:00.000Z	DanHowell		dig yahoo.com worked fine
2006-08-15T07:36:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	DanHowell	then your sources list is not correct.
2006-08-15T07:36:00.000Z	fyrestrtr		!easysource
2006-08-15T07:36:00.000Z	DanHowell		ok
2006-08-15T07:39:00.000Z	DanHowell	fyrestrtr	where's sources.list?
2006-08-15T07:40:00.000Z	DanHowell	fyrestrtr	where should sources.list be?
2006-08-15T07:41:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	DanHowell	read that website
