2010-02-26T05:25:00.000Z	Gstar		no raj linux isnt thats the thing if one distro is doing that you can always use another
2010-02-26T05:25:00.000Z	Gstar		or stick to LTS
2010-02-26T05:26:00.000Z	Gstar		thing is you have the windows mentality upgrade .. upgrade
2010-02-26T05:26:00.000Z	raj	Gstar	i am stuck on 8.04 on my older machine because nvidia stop suporting non SSE chipsets older than p4/amd semp thast why im mad. i trie dto compile older drivers 96.xx with no luck under the new kernel
2010-02-26T05:28:00.000Z	Gstar	raj	your missing the point of LTS
2010-02-26T05:29:00.000Z	raj	Gstar	nothing is wrong with 8.04 but i have to manually compile all the new software that no longer have .deb for ubuntu 8.04
2010-02-26T05:30:00.000Z	Gstar	raj	but your going aqgainst the LTS by installing newer versions against the repos
2010-02-26T05:31:00.000Z	raj	Gstar	i cant exactly live with firefox 3.0 forever and cheese 0.4 and gimpp 1.xx i believe
2010-02-26T05:31:00.000Z	raj	Gstar	and oopenoffice 2.4 :S
2010-02-26T05:32:00.000Z	Gstar	raj	yeah for certain apps its ok as long as its not everything
2010-02-26T05:33:00.000Z	Gstar	raj	if you need everything up to date choose a diff distro
2010-02-26T05:33:00.000Z	Gstar	raj	debian and ubuntu are about stability
2010-02-26T05:34:00.000Z	raj	Gstar	i will play with puppy linux this weekend and see if i can get nvidia working under the new release ( older nvidia drivers that support non sse)
2010-02-26T05:35:00.000Z	Gstar	raj	maybe try centOS
2010-02-26T05:37:00.000Z	Gstar	raj	sorry you need support for older hardware
2010-02-26T05:37:00.000Z	raj	Gstar	ill keep centOS in my mind :) thx of rteh suggestions.. i already have Slitaz too and will try it as well .. i got nothing better to do on sundays :)
2010-02-26T05:38:00.000Z	Gstar	raj	centOs is a good choice if you want to keep up with the latest
2010-02-26T05:38:00.000Z	raj	Gstar	do you have any idea what kernel they are using?
