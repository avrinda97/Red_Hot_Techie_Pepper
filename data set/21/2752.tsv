2009-08-21T09:21:00.000Z	SnakDoc		dd if=image.img of=/dev/sda would that work to make system image ?
2009-08-21T09:22:00.000Z	SnakDoc		i did that in reverse then i am wanting to pull hd to image
2009-08-21T09:22:00.000Z	SnakDoc		dd if=/dev/sda of=image.img that look better
2009-08-21T09:22:00.000Z	raylu	SnakDoc	if means input file... so i think your command is backwards
2009-08-21T09:22:00.000Z	raylu	SnakDoc	also, why are you doing this?
2009-08-21T09:23:00.000Z	SnakDoc	raylu	was wanting to make system image you know of better way this was just my idea
2009-08-21T09:23:00.000Z	SnakDoc	raylu	i had used dd command in past
2009-08-21T09:23:00.000Z	raylu	SnakDoc	yes, but why do you want a system image? rsync is better for incremental backups, and you can choose to not back up certain sections
2009-08-21T09:24:00.000Z	raylu	SnakDoc	there are also a ton of other backup tools for keeping smaller backup files by date
2009-08-21T09:24:00.000Z	raylu	SnakDoc	dd should be a last resort for backing stuff up
2009-08-21T09:24:00.000Z	SnakDoc	raylu	i am formatting cause i have to but would like to restore right back to as is
2009-08-21T09:24:00.000Z	raylu	SnakDoc	then... why are you formatting?
2009-08-21T09:25:00.000Z	SnakDoc	raylu	i am having hardware error if i can prove that error in windows laptop will be replaced
2009-08-21T09:26:00.000Z	raylu	SnakDoc	oh.
2009-08-21T09:26:00.000Z	raylu	SnakDoc	ok, go ahead.
2009-08-21T09:27:00.000Z	SnakDoc	raylu	laptop not showing battery or changing but just to keep it from being blamed on ubuntu when i take it back was going to install default image to it
2009-08-21T09:27:00.000Z	SnakDoc	raylu	would it be bad for the partition to be mounted ?
2009-08-21T09:28:00.000Z	raylu	SnakDoc	partitions on the drive, you mean? yes
2009-08-21T09:28:00.000Z	SnakDoc	raylu	nm found ans it would be bad need to use live image found this http://www.linuxweblog.com/blogs/sandip/20050211/image-your-hard-drive-using-dd
2009-08-21T10:03:00.000Z	raylu	SnakDoc	grep lm /proc/cpuinfo
2009-08-21T10:03:00.000Z	raylu	SnakDoc	also, i'm pretty confident it is 64-bit
