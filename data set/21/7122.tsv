2007-09-21T07:39:00.000Z	MasterShrek	sasa	sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list and uncomment the appropriate lines
2007-09-21T07:39:00.000Z	MasterShrek	sasa	then sudo apt-get update
2007-09-21T07:54:00.000Z	MasterShrek	sasa	if there is a line for it in /etc/fstab it will automount every time
2007-09-21T07:56:00.000Z	sasa	MasterShrek	and Scguy318: I think this is the final answer....how do I edit (where in the file) do I edit fstab?
2007-09-21T07:57:00.000Z	MasterShrek	sasa	sudo gedit /etc/fstab  just copy the line for / but change for your new mount
2007-09-21T07:57:00.000Z	sasa	MasterShrek	you mean paste this line in there "sudo ntfs-3g /dev/hdc1  /mnt/mountme"?
2007-09-24T07:28:00.000Z	MasterShrek	sasa	enable multiverse
2007-09-24T07:34:00.000Z	sasa	MasterShrek	thank you for the multiverse comment....that worked. However, when I try to install dvd::rip, I get an error message saying "could not mark all packages for installation or upgrade...following packages have unresolvable dependencies. Make sure that all required repositories are added and enabled in the preferences"
2007-09-24T07:34:00.000Z	MasterShrek	sasa	what packages need dependencies?
2007-09-24T07:34:00.000Z	sasa	MasterShrek	dvdrip:
2007-09-24T07:35:00.000Z	MasterShrek	sasa	does it say waht packages they conflict with?
2007-09-24T07:35:00.000Z	sasa	MasterShrek	that is all it lists in there...
2007-09-24T07:36:00.000Z	MasterShrek	sasa	do you have universe enabled also?
2007-09-24T07:37:00.000Z	MasterShrek	sasa	i usually enable all the ones that are listed, plus i usually end up adding a few more :)
2007-09-24T07:39:00.000Z	sasa	MasterShrek	i'm in business...it's downloading now. Thank you!
2007-09-24T07:40:00.000Z	sasa	MasterShrek	I do have one more question: I installed K3b. Upon its startup, I get a message:  please install the MAD Mp3 decoding library as well as the K3b MAD Mp3 decoder plugin (the latter may already be installed but not functional due to the missing libmad). I installed package libmad0, but I still get the same error message. Any thoughts?
2007-09-24T07:41:00.000Z	MasterShrek	sasa	try install libmad0-dev
2007-09-24T07:42:00.000Z	MasterShrek	sasa	and madplay if that still doesnt work
2007-09-24T07:46:00.000Z	sasa	MasterShrek	I installed libmad dev and madplay and I still get the same message upon K3b startup
2007-09-24T07:47:00.000Z	MasterShrek	sasa	type locate libmad, mine are in /usr/lib dont paste the results here though, youll get kicked
2007-09-24T07:50:00.000Z	sasa	MasterShrek	I reinstalled those two packages and it worked!!
