2007-08-17T11:27:00.000Z	thedash		hmm, I can't quite figure this out; I have a line that works in the terminal, but when I try to create a launcher with that command, it doesn't do anything
2007-08-17T11:27:00.000Z	demonspork	thedash	what is the line?
2007-08-17T11:27:00.000Z	thedash		/usr/bin/vncviewer -passwd ~/.vnc/passwd 192.168.2.20:0.0
2007-08-17T11:28:00.000Z	thedash	demonspork	:: that doesn't really matter though, it works in the terminal fine
2007-08-17T11:29:00.000Z	demonspork	thedash	what all is it supposed to do for you
2007-08-17T11:29:00.000Z	thedash	demonspork	:: it's supposed to open the vncviewer program to that IP address, with the password in the file
2007-08-17T11:29:00.000Z	demonspork	thedash	should it initialize a vncviewer window?
2007-08-17T11:29:00.000Z	thedash	demonspork	:: yeh, basically
2007-08-17T11:31:00.000Z	demonspork	thedash	ok, when you go to make the launcher, the first option says "Type: Application"
2007-08-17T11:31:00.000Z	demonspork	thedash	simply change that to "Application in Terminal"
2007-08-17T11:32:00.000Z	thedash	demonspork	:: I tried that, it opens the terminal and closes it immediately
2007-08-17T11:34:00.000Z	demonspork	thedash	I don't understand it fully, but some applications require a terminal to run
2007-08-17T11:34:00.000Z	thedash	demonspork	:: regardless, it doesn't run either way
2007-08-17T11:35:00.000Z	demonspork	thedash	so the vncviewer isn't working even when run from a terminal?
2007-08-17T11:35:00.000Z	thedash	demonspork	:: it works when I run it from a terminal, yes, but it doesn't work at all when run from the launcher, terminal or no
2007-08-17T11:36:00.000Z	demonspork	thedash	in my own vnc setup I simply bypass the need for the vncviewer, if you are using tightvncserver, it has a built in java interface that can be accessed over http
2007-08-17T11:41:00.000Z	thedash	demonspork	:: I seem to have the same problems with xtightvncviewer
2007-08-17T11:43:00.000Z	demonspork		I don't know what else to do
2007-08-17T11:45:00.000Z	demonspork	thedash	have you tried using Applications > Internet > Terminal Servers Client
2007-08-17T11:46:00.000Z	demonspork	thedash	that is vncviewer with a graphical config I think
2007-08-17T11:49:00.000Z	demonspork	thedash	when I made a launcher for vncviewer to connect to my server, it worked correctly when set as "application in terminal", the only difference is that I included the host in the command and it asked for the password rather than having that done by  passwd
