2005-06-13T06:50:00.000Z	IIIEars	cafuego	- you have worked really hard on ubotu. - thanks :0
2005-06-13T06:50:00.000Z	cafuego	IIIEars	it's a bit pouintlessif it just goes and fucks itself up twice a day, though.
2005-06-13T06:51:00.000Z	IIIEars	cafuego	- what does "info" do?
2005-06-13T06:54:00.000Z	IIIEars	cafuego	- N-o-o-o! - lol (covers eyes)
2005-07-20T07:37:00.000Z	IIIEars	cafuego	- Your bot is an info gold mine. - grin
2005-07-23T05:52:00.000Z	cafuego	IIIEars	yeah, you can throw those away. Corrosive as hell.
2005-07-23T05:52:00.000Z	cafuego	IIIEars	That said, my Laserjet survived (though it needed a service and clean-out)
2005-07-23T05:53:00.000Z	cafuego	IIIEars	If you can remove the actual drive from the case, rinsing the case in warm water and letting it dry out for a few days might save 'em
2005-07-23T05:53:00.000Z	IIIEars	cafuego	- interesting idea. i just tied the usb cable and box to the cats tail. - Just kidding.
2005-07-23T05:54:00.000Z	cafuego	IIIEars	I rescued an apple keyboard by dumping it in warm water and hanging it on a clothesline for a week. Mind you, that was coffee, not cat.
2005-07-23T05:55:00.000Z	cafuego	IIIEars	corks
2005-07-27T07:38:00.000Z	cafuego	IIIEars	yeah. Insert cd, boot, be asked to wipe HDD< have cd create accounts for students, with vservers.
2005-07-31T07:22:00.000Z	cafuego	IIIEars	Not easily.
2005-07-31T07:22:00.000Z	cafuego	IIIEars	... and if the system has been running for a while since the deletion, it's probably been overwritten
2005-07-31T07:28:00.000Z	cafuego	IIIEars	I don't know. I often wonder if they're looking at the screen AT ALL when they type that shit.
2005-08-02T11:33:00.000Z	IIIEars	cafuego	encompassed a lot of difficult effort in three little words. - REALLY nice bot cafuego.
