2008-08-19T10:17:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	sarthor	Does wifi work?
2008-08-19T10:17:00.000Z	sarthor	LSD|Ninja	Yes
2008-08-19T10:18:00.000Z	sarthor	LSD|Ninja	i am using intenrt via that wifi now.
2008-08-19T10:18:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	sarthor	then you're probably using b4x or something
2008-08-19T10:18:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	sarthor	lsmod and see what's associated with mac80211
2008-08-19T10:19:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	sarthor	Sorry, most people with Broadcom forget to keep a wired connection handy and wonder why it's so hard to get going
2008-08-19T10:20:00.000Z	sarthor	LSD|Ninja	ieee80211_crypt         7040  2 ieee80211_crypt_tkip,wl
2008-08-19T10:22:00.000Z	sarthor	LSD|Ninja	should i wait? or its over?
2008-08-19T10:22:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	sarthor	sorry, was trying to find a more precise way of working out what driver you're on :P
2008-08-19T10:23:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	sarthor	b43 is the new one I believe
2008-08-19T10:23:00.000Z	sarthor	LSD|Ninja	yes. i installed b43-wcutter i think.
2008-08-19T10:23:00.000Z	sarthor	LSD|Ninja	so will it be my driver name to write in my kismet.conf??
2008-08-19T10:25:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	sarthor	I don't know, I've never used kisment. If I were to guess though I'd say probably not. My guess would be what framework you use for wireless in general which I believe is wext (wireless extensions) for most native drivers
