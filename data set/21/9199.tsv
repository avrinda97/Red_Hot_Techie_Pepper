2005-12-13T06:24:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta		Of course, to a *new* one.
2005-12-13T06:24:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta		But for some reason I assumed you meant connecting to one which was already up. o__O
2005-12-13T06:24:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta		Hm.
2005-12-13T06:24:00.000Z	Seveas	YukiIkyuta	named pipes or redirecting to the pty of the process
2005-12-13T06:25:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	Seveas	true.
2005-12-13T06:27:00.000Z	Seveas	YukiIkyuta	look at http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/5504 for inspiration
2005-12-13T06:29:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	Seveas	I love proc. ^^;
2005-12-13T07:54:00.000Z	Seveas	YukiIkyuta	wow :)
2005-12-13T07:55:00.000Z	Seveas	YukiIkyuta	bad recursion? too much pass-by-value of large structures?
2005-12-13T07:55:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	Seveas	bad recursion indeed! I tried `f -1' to select the `first from last' frame, but of course gdb doesn't support this and froze my system for a good 10 seconds then returned.
2005-12-13T07:56:00.000Z	Seveas	YukiIkyuta	:)
2005-12-13T07:58:00.000Z	Seveas	YukiIkyuta	coffee deprivation?
2005-12-13T07:58:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	Seveas	possibly, probably moreso because I don't drink coffee but it's 1am anyway =__=
2005-12-13T08:00:00.000Z	Seveas	YukiIkyuta	sleep --force --now --until-you\'re-awake-again
2005-12-13T08:04:00.000Z	Seveas	YukiIkyuta	I thought you went to bed?
2005-12-13T08:04:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	Seveas	I'm in bed. With a laptop. With an XDMCP[sp?]  client open. >___>;
2005-12-13T08:06:00.000Z	Seveas	YukiIkyuta	vnc is even worse :)
2005-12-13T08:06:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	Seveas	what's the alternative? oO
2005-12-13T08:24:00.000Z	Seveas	YukiIkyuta	you're talking to yourself - get some sleep :)
2005-12-13T08:26:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	Seveas	... I didn't even notice that.
