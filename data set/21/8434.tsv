2006-04-05T10:10:00.000Z	Jawbreaker4Fs		is there a way to install ubuntu without using the default gui?
2006-04-05T10:11:00.000Z	Jawbreaker4Fs		no no
2006-04-05T10:11:00.000Z	Jawbreaker4Fs		I'm talking about when you boot
2006-04-05T10:11:00.000Z	Jawbreaker4Fs		the install cd
2006-04-05T10:11:00.000Z	Jawbreaker4Fs		and it gives you the "boot:" prompt.. or something similar
2006-04-05T10:11:00.000Z	Jawbreaker4Fs		just hitting enter takes you into a weird little sort of gui thing
2006-04-05T10:12:00.000Z	Jawbreaker4Fs		well, it's like a pseudo-gui
2006-04-05T10:12:00.000Z	Jawbreaker4Fs		an asciiart-ui
2006-04-05T10:12:00.000Z	Jawbreaker4Fs		sort of
2006-04-05T10:12:00.000Z	Jawbreaker4Fs		it flickers uncontrollably
2006-04-05T10:12:00.000Z	carbo	Jawbreaker4Fs	at the boot: prompt hit F1 to F7 to see some options
2006-04-05T10:12:00.000Z	Jawbreaker4Fs		and I can't get through the install process using it.. is there perhaps an alternative
2006-04-05T10:12:00.000Z	Jawbreaker4Fs	carbo	thanks.. I'll give that a shot
2006-04-05T10:13:00.000Z	Jawbreaker4Fs		dell sent me a replacement laptop because my old one died (long story), and I'm really trying hard to get ubuntu back on but it's proving to be difficult
2006-04-05T10:13:00.000Z	carbo	Jawbreaker4Fs	in particular there's an option regarding video.. can't remember though, but it might fix the flickerking enough to let you install
2006-04-05T10:15:00.000Z	Jawbreaker4Fs	carbo	thanks! just pressing f1 led me to do "linux debian-installer/framebuffer=false" which worked PERFECTLY!!!
2006-04-05T10:16:00.000Z	carbo	Jawbreaker4Fs	glad it works :D
2006-04-05T10:17:00.000Z	Jawbreaker4Fs		carbo... I know it might be hard to tell at this point, but when I reboot after the base system is installed... will that setting be saved to install the other packages?
2006-04-05T10:17:00.000Z	Jawbreaker4Fs		I know it launches back into that text based ui thing
2006-04-05T10:17:00.000Z	carbo	Jawbreaker4Fs	if i remember correctly, whatever options you use to install will be used for booting later on
2006-04-05T10:18:00.000Z	Jawbreaker4Fs	carbo	thanks again!
