2011-08-08T07:07:00.000Z	diamonds		I mean, I see "fwcutter" over here and "don't use fwcutter" over there
2011-08-08T07:08:00.000Z	diamonds		I'm not sure if I should be going off the enet controller or network controller when looking for solutions...

2011-08-08T07:16:00.000Z	rakathan	diamonds	if you're trying to find a network you can use airodump-ng...if you want to connect to a network use iwconfig
