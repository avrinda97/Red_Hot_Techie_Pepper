2008-02-14T18:56:00.000Z	test3r		um why wont pastebin work with NoScript plugin running
2008-02-14T18:57:00.000Z	test3r		i have a PYTHON question
2008-02-14T18:57:00.000Z	test3r		cant even use pastebin
2008-02-14T18:57:00.000Z	jrib	test3r	use a different pastebin.  It tests for bots by detecting if the browser runs javascript
2008-02-14T19:08:00.000Z	jrib	test3r	"xml.parsers.expat.ExpatError: no element found: line 1, column 0" Find out what file it is trying to parse
2008-02-14T19:39:00.000Z	test3r	jrib	> OK I've even tried reinstall. Now that I've moved the last files it was fussing with bak in place, it now makes a New error, more grewsome. now its wanting gtk and its calling TreeView (because they put in a file browser button/widget in this program- obviously incorrectly)
2008-02-14T19:39:00.000Z	test3r	jrib	r u still there? n about?  =)
2008-02-14T19:40:00.000Z	jrib	test3r	did this program ever work?
2008-02-14T19:40:00.000Z	jrib	test3r	does par2 work without the gui?
2008-02-14T19:47:00.000Z	test3r	jrib	> par2 itself appears to be fine. I think I've been here b4! Deja Vu!@ this program needs a fixing I'ma write a note & learn C# Today.
2008-02-14T19:47:00.000Z	jrib	test3r	you should try purging it and installing again
2008-02-14T19:49:00.000Z	jrib	test3r	not sure, do 'sudo aptitude purge pypar2' to be certain
2008-02-14T19:49:00.000Z	jrib	test3r	see what nickrud said.  Thanks nickrud
2008-02-14T19:50:00.000Z	jrib	test3r	well you are going to reinstall it
2008-02-14T20:03:00.000Z	test3r	jrib	> Even doing aptitude purge, than install on it changed nothing with the error it gives me. I guess I'll just use normal par2 pak in terminal. I should contact pak maker & explain error, though.
2008-02-14T20:11:00.000Z	jrib	test3r	pastebin the error?
2008-02-14T20:16:00.000Z	test3r	jrib	> the fourth line changed to include that "tree view" call that time. then thats when i knew it was because I moved files before I closed That program. It's still trying to call. The files are moved bak. Im about to move bak ALL related files to try
2008-02-14T20:19:00.000Z	jrib	test3r	I don't understand what files you are moving around.  Are these the files that par2 parses?
2008-02-14T20:23:00.000Z	test3r	jrib	> yeah- TreeView itself , in GNOME, seems fine. it's just when i try that program it says "trace call blah blah " dumb program
2008-02-14T20:25:00.000Z	test3r	jrib	> TY for working with me and eaching me -purge
2008-02-14T20:25:00.000Z	jrib	test3r	np, good luck
