2006-09-02T06:03:00.000Z	ccooke	OmegaNine	System -> Preferences -> Power Management
2006-09-02T06:03:00.000Z	OmegaNine	ccooke	It has nothing other than how long to wait before going in to "sleep" modes
2006-09-02T06:04:00.000Z	ccooke	OmegaNine	Ah. There's no unfied control for the rest, but it's getting easier.
2006-09-02T06:05:00.000Z	ccooke	OmegaNine	what exactly do you want to acheive?
2006-09-02T06:05:00.000Z	OmegaNine	ccooke	Longer battery life.  Its but almost in half with ubuntu
2006-09-02T06:06:00.000Z	ccooke	OmegaNine	How did you have Windows set up?
2006-09-02T06:06:00.000Z	ccooke	OmegaNine	As in, what were your power management settings under windows?
2006-09-02T06:10:00.000Z	ccooke	OmegaNine	Okay, so. You've already got processor throttling.
2006-09-02T06:10:00.000Z	ccooke	OmegaNine	what you need, then, would be screen brightness and spinning down the hdd
2006-09-02T06:11:00.000Z	OmegaNine	ccooke	*cheks* acutally my screen was pretty bright 3 of 8
2006-09-02T06:12:00.000Z	ccooke	OmegaNine	not necessarily
2006-09-02T06:12:00.000Z	ccooke	OmegaNine	no, it's not.

2006-09-02T06:15:00.000Z	ccooke	OmegaNine	It's got a lot of tips for battery life as comments
2006-09-02T06:16:00.000Z	ccooke	OmegaNine	Read the lot before doing anything, though, since some of the bits in there give ad-hoc solutions where later there's a better one
2006-09-02T06:17:00.000Z	ccooke	OmegaNine	Oh, and try https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ReducedPowerUsage
2006-09-02T06:18:00.000Z	ccooke	OmegaNine	No problem.
2006-09-02T06:20:00.000Z	ccooke	OmegaNine	It does, yes. The VM tweaks I pointed you at will help, too
2006-09-02T06:21:00.000Z	ccooke	OmegaNine	If you have an ATI card, you might like to try the fglrx tweak, too
2006-09-02T06:22:00.000Z	OmegaNine	ccooke	Im looking at it now.  Nice resources.  I see alot of people asking this, might be worth adding these to the bot.
