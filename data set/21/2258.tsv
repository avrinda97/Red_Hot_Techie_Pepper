2010-05-05T01:00:00.000Z	Oddbio		Hello, I have an issue with laptop screen brightness. It is stuck on a very dark setting, but the brightness applet says it's at 100%. I also cannot adjust the slider at all, if I try to move it it just goes away, but still says it's 100% brightness.  The thing is that I had my laptop screen set to very dark when I had windows installed, so I guess when I installed Ubuntu it didn't reset the screen brightness.  Is there any way to change the b

2010-05-05T01:04:00.000Z	Oddbio	stefg	It's a SONY VAIO PCG-K45   and I'm using Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
2010-05-05T01:07:00.000Z	stefg	Oddbio	try running sudo apt-get install smartdimmer
2010-05-05T01:07:00.000Z	Oddbio	stefg	will do

2010-05-05T01:11:00.000Z	stefg	Oddbio	you have the nonfree Nvidia driver installed?
2010-05-05T01:15:00.000Z	Oddbio	stefg	I have a radeon GPU
2010-05-05T01:16:00.000Z	stefg	Oddbio	ah, ok. then that tool will be useless. it assumes an nvidia chip. 'sudo apt-get autoremove --purge smartdimmer' will uninstall it again
2010-05-05T01:17:00.000Z	Oddbio	stefg	I think something might be wrong then with my configuration.. either that or 10.04 is a lot different than 9.10. Because I also tried the program "spicctrl" and it says can't find /dev/sony, and also I'm reading that I should have a file called "brightness" in /proc/acpi/video/sony  but I don't have anything like that...
2010-05-05T01:18:00.000Z	stefg	Oddbio	what i can tell is that it is an ACPI problem. so  you'll need a workaround for a buggy BIOS
2010-05-05T01:19:00.000Z	Oddbio	stefg	hmmm.. now that you mention BIOS, I think my BIOS options might actually allow me to change my brightness from there...  I'm going to try it.
2010-05-05T01:26:00.000Z	Oddbio	stefg	no my BIOS didn't have a brightness option I even tried setting the defaults and it's still dark... It has to be something like that though because it initially starts bright and then dims very shortly after I turn it on.. but before GRUB even loads so it's not Ubuntu...
2010-05-05T01:30:00.000Z	stefg	Oddbio	maybe http://blog.gmane.org/gmane.linux.acpi.devel/month=20051101/page=25 sheds some light on your issue
2010-05-05T01:31:00.000Z	Oddbio	stefg	it worked!! thanks for your help! I guess the BIOS reset did do the trick, it just started dark but it's bright now  lol
2010-05-05T01:32:00.000Z	stefg	Oddbio	as i found in some linux developer blog (link above) it seems to have a broken acpi table
2010-05-05T01:34:00.000Z	Oddbio	stefg	oh did you see my last message? It's working now  :)  thanks for your help... or do you think the broken acpi table is going to cause other issues?
2010-05-05T01:35:00.000Z	stefg	Oddbio	watch out for your cpu temp and battery life...
2010-05-05T01:35:00.000Z	Oddbio	stefg	is that in general? Or is Ubuntu hard on this laptop model?  My battery is pretty much shot already though, I dont' mind that.
2010-05-05T01:36:00.000Z	Oddbio	stefg	but I'll monitor the temp, thanks for the heads up
