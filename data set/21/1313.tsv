2010-11-01T15:13:00.000Z	burhan	Dirty_Snipe	re-install php5 on your machine, your modules are corrupt.
2010-11-01T15:14:00.000Z	Dirty_Snipe	burhan	whats the best way to flush it all out
2010-11-01T15:14:00.000Z	Dirty_Snipe	burhan	hmm i might just start from scratch
2010-11-01T15:53:00.000Z	burhan	Dirty_Snipe	you have two other options - either sudo tasksel install lamp-server; or use the free zend server which has this all bundled together along with a nice GUI to manage it.
2010-11-01T15:56:00.000Z	Dirty_Snipe	burhan	Thanks, Ill take a snapshot then have a peek at zend server
