2008-03-28T00:32:00.000Z	soundray	CJS3141	what's your hardware?
2008-03-28T00:18:00.000Z	soundray	CJS3141	/etc/X11
2008-03-28T00:19:00.000Z	CJS3141	soundray	Thanks :-)
2008-03-28T00:28:00.000Z	soundray	CJS3141	lspci lists the attached hardware, not the drivers
2008-03-28T00:29:00.000Z	CJS3141	soundray	Thanks, so is it the xorg.conf file that lists the drivers? or some other file?
2008-03-28T00:29:00.000Z	soundray	CJS3141	what's the problem you are ultimately trying to solve?
2008-03-28T00:31:00.000Z	CJS3141	soundray	Good question! :-) I'm trying to enable my "visual effects", but it won't let me, so I'm trying to troubleshoot... I'm trying first to determine which video driver I'm using.
2008-03-28T00:33:00.000Z	CJS3141	soundray	I'm using a Compaq FS740 monitor that according to "lspci" uses a Nvidia controller.
2008-03-28T00:35:00.000Z	soundray	CJS3141	then you are probably using the open source 'nv' driver, which doesn't support accelerated 3D. Try what hexon said, it should offer you the closed-source nvidia drivers.
2008-03-28T00:40:00.000Z	soundray	CJS3141	it seems you've done all the right things. It's possible that your Riva TNT is too old for desktop effects.
2008-03-28T00:40:00.000Z	soundray	CJS3141	they get in the way of serious work, anyway
2008-03-28T00:41:00.000Z	CJS3141	soundray	:-P Good point!
2008-03-28T00:47:00.000Z	soundray	CJS3141	too old
2008-03-28T00:48:00.000Z	CJS3141	soundray	:-) So my monitor is too old for the extra effects? It's not an issue with the nvidia driver? Just want to make sure.
2008-03-28T00:49:00.000Z	soundray	CJS3141	it's an issue with your NVidia graphics card
2008-03-28T00:57:00.000Z	soundray	CJS3141	it's fairly easy to upgrade a graphics card
2008-03-28T00:58:00.000Z	CJS3141	soundray	I'm sure it is, but I'd rather upgrade my computer before I mess with my graphics card! :-) My computer's too old to invest anything else in.
2008-03-28T00:59:00.000Z	soundray	CJS3141	your choice, but the used market is such that you can get very capable graphics cards very cheaply
2008-04-04T19:20:00.000Z	soundray	CJS3141	/proc files aren't regular files, they are an interface to the kernel. Don't use gedit to access /proc entries.
2008-04-04T19:22:00.000Z	CJS3141	soundray	OK! :-) Actually, maybe I figured out my problem-- if I do a "file block_dump" it claims the file is empty, so why does "more block_dump
2008-04-04T19:23:00.000Z	CJS3141	soundray	.... return 0? (sorry hit return too soon)
