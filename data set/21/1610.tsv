2010-07-15T01:42:00.000Z	alexander_		woah loshki scratch that I think it's working?!
2010-07-15T01:43:00.000Z	alexander_		Different much easier question now: can I xfer a file betwix my virtual windows box and real Linux box?
2010-07-15T01:44:00.000Z	racethesunlive	alexander_	what type of software are you using to host the virtual machine?
2010-07-15T01:44:00.000Z	alexander_		virtualbox ose
2010-07-15T01:45:00.000Z	alexander_	racethesunlive	virtualbox ose
2010-07-15T01:46:00.000Z	racethesunlive	alexander_	you can transfer files back and forth using the shared folder options
2010-07-15T01:46:00.000Z	racethesunlive	alexander_	on the windows box it'll be under //vboxsvr/foldername
2010-07-15T01:47:00.000Z	alexander_		roger thanks I'll get on it racethesunlive
2010-07-15T01:49:00.000Z	alexander_		is that pretty easy monty I'm not seeing a vboxsvr folder
2010-07-15T01:50:00.000Z	racethesunlive	alexander_	it wont make the \\vboxsvr network share until you set up a shared folder in the virtualbox settings for that machine
2010-07-15T01:50:00.000Z	racethesunlive	alexander_	sorry its \\vboxsrv\ not svr
2010-07-15T01:52:00.000Z	alexander_		monty yeah I'm reading one thanks
2010-07-15T01:57:00.000Z	alexander_	racethesunlive	created a shared folder under vbox options but it doesn't show up under network sharing center on the v machine
2010-07-15T01:58:00.000Z	racethesunlive	alexander_	you could also try manually entering it in explorer, the path would be \\vboxsrv\sharename
2010-07-15T02:00:00.000Z	alexander_		vboxsvr doesn't exist on my virtual machine racethesunlive
2010-07-15T02:02:00.000Z	racethesunlive	alexander_	you have the guest additions installed on the virtual machine correct?
2010-07-15T02:04:00.000Z	alexander_		no racethesunlive I don't think I did that and I've just checked google and it's still not clear how to do it :p i found instructions for vbox running on windows but not a vbox on ubuntu running windows
2010-07-15T02:05:00.000Z	racethesunlive	alexander_	the reason you cant see the \\vboxsvr network is that guest additions must first be installed on the windows virtual machine
2010-07-15T02:06:00.000Z	alexander_		the "install guest additions" option isn't anywhere on the virtualbox menus for me racethesunlive
2010-07-15T02:10:00.000Z	racethesunlive	alexander_	it should be under devices: at the top of the virtual machines window
2010-07-15T02:10:00.000Z	alexander_	racethesunlive	it isn't but I found instructions on various commands to run and I'm trying that now
