2009-04-25T05:44:00.000Z	evantandersen		oops
2009-04-25T05:45:00.000Z	evantandersen		 i'm having trouble with a shell script. I need to take this string "+XX.0C" (Where X is a number) , turn it into a pure number so i can add it to a sum
2009-04-25T05:45:00.000Z	mysphyt	evantandersen	Have you tried sed?
2009-04-25T05:45:00.000Z	evantandersen	mysphyt	no
2009-04-25T05:45:00.000Z	mysphyt	evantandersen	Can you pastebin the script?
2009-04-25T05:48:00.000Z	evantandersen	mysphyt	http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/m5d679817
2009-04-25T05:52:00.000Z	mysphyt	evantandersen	I'm installing lm-sensors so I can see what your input's like.  :P
2009-04-25T05:54:00.000Z	evantandersen	mysphyt	well that grep command gives me +66.0*C +67.0*C (Degrees sign, i can't do it) I have a dual core macbook
2009-04-25T05:56:00.000Z	mysphyt	evantandersen	So are you trying to get an integer, or just trying to get rid of the + and the degrees celsius?
2009-04-25T05:57:00.000Z	evantandersen	mysphyt	yes i want an interger. The number after decimal place is always a 0, so yeah an interger
2009-04-25T06:02:00.000Z	mysphyt	evantandersen	Try the updated version here: http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/m1478d00d
2009-04-25T06:04:00.000Z	mysphyt	evantandersen	All I've futzed with is the loop itself; the sed command strips it down to just the integer.  There are more elegant ways to do it, but that regexp should work as long as the input doesn't change.
2009-04-25T06:05:00.000Z	evantandersen	mysphyt	it says /usr/bin/temp: line 17: syntax error near unexpected token `done'
2009-04-25T06:06:00.000Z	mysphyt	evantandersen	Ah.  Get rid of the " ; done" at the end of the line I edited; it's redundant in the script.  In any case, the sed command should do what youw ant.
2009-04-25T06:08:00.000Z	evantandersen	mysphyt	now it says Unexpected end of file
2009-04-25T06:09:00.000Z	mysphyt	evantandersen	Again, I was working on the line by itself, rather than the whole script.  The thing to pay attention to is the sed command I added--it'll do the processing you want.
2009-04-25T06:09:00.000Z	evantandersen	mysphyt	yeah thanks
2009-04-25T06:13:00.000Z	evantandersen	mysphyt	no matter where i place the "done"(s) i can't get it to work
2009-04-25T06:16:00.000Z	mysphyt	evantandersen	I'm sorry to say that's a logic problem.  I wish I had time to debug the whole script for you, but unfortunately I have to leave--just make sure you've got all your loops correctly matched (that is, a "do" for each "done" and likewise).
2009-04-25T06:16:00.000Z	evantandersen	mysphyt	thanks alot
