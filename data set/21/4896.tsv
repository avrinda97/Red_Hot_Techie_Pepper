2008-01-22T03:02:00.000Z	chazco		Hi... which would be the best option? Gusty under VirtualBox on XP or a duel-boot system? Tried XP under Virtualbox on Gusty but Gusty still has too many issues :(
2008-01-22T03:03:00.000Z	seasonfive	chazco	why would you want to keep your windows ? :p
2008-01-22T03:03:00.000Z	chazco	seasonfive	- Because Ubuntu wont let me use my PocketPC, Samsung phone and has issues with my uni documents and website... :D
2008-01-22T03:04:00.000Z	seasonfive	chazco	wow, seems you have all the things microsoft sell :)
2008-01-22T03:04:00.000Z	chazco		Anyway, trying to work out the best way to keep both?
2008-01-22T03:04:00.000Z	seasonfive	chazco	by the way, i don't see how your computer prevent you of using your pocketpc :)
2008-01-22T03:05:00.000Z	chazco		I cant syncronise with it, which i really need to
2008-01-22T03:05:00.000Z	seasonfive	chazco	the simplest way is to find a better phone and a better uni
2008-01-22T03:05:00.000Z	chazco		Put bluntly, Ubuntu cant cut it currently, so i need Windows
2008-01-22T03:05:00.000Z	chazco		But i like Ubuntu for most stuff, which means i need both :D
2008-01-22T03:07:00.000Z	seasonfive	chazco	nobody need windows :)
2008-01-22T03:07:00.000Z	seasonfive	chazco	then i guess Gutsy on XP is just fine for you ?
2008-01-22T03:08:00.000Z	seasonfive	chazco	but me it doesn't worth such effort
2008-01-22T03:08:00.000Z	chazco		Ok... tell me how to use Linux to sync my PPC calender, sync my phone calender, use my USB keyboard and access my uni intranet, print stuff the same as it supposed to look (even with MS fonts + Softmaker)... and i'll not need Windows then :)
2008-01-22T03:08:00.000Z	chazco		So... performance wise... duel-boot or Virtualbox on XP?

2008-01-22T03:10:00.000Z	seasonfive	chazco	lol
2008-01-22T03:10:00.000Z	chazco		Only got 256MB of RAM, and running XP in Virtualbox currently :D
2008-01-22T03:10:00.000Z	seasonfive	chazco	even your computer don't want windows anymore :)
