2012-05-22T17:52:00.000Z	acicula		dash you mean a virtual console or a serial terminal?
2012-05-22T17:53:00.000Z	dash	acicula	a virtual console
2012-05-22T17:54:00.000Z	acicula	dash	pressing ctrl-alt-F2 etc doesnt give you a vt?
2012-05-22T17:54:00.000Z	dash	acicula	it does but it prompts for login
2012-05-22T17:54:00.000Z	dash	acicula	and i don't know what accounts the installer has.
2012-05-22T17:54:00.000Z	acicula	dash	euh, try all F keys, think one of them should just give you a login
2012-05-22T17:56:00.000Z	dash	acicula	it's the usual normal-linux setup, 6 VCs and X
2012-05-22T17:56:00.000Z	dash	acicula	first 6 running login
2012-05-22T17:56:00.000Z	acicula	dash	ah its an existing installation?
2012-05-22T17:56:00.000Z	dash	acicula	no, this is the installer.
2012-05-22T17:56:00.000Z	dash	acicula	I _have_ an existing installation on an external disk, which I would like to poke at :)
2012-05-22T17:57:00.000Z	dash	acicula	but my boot media got screwed up
2012-05-22T17:57:00.000Z	dash	acicula	so i thought the installer would help me :)
2012-05-22T17:57:00.000Z	acicula	dash	ah
2012-05-22T17:58:00.000Z	acicula	dash	euh, you can use the installer to boot your own system directly or drop to a live system and then chroot into your system
2012-05-22T17:58:00.000Z	dash	acicula	that's what I want to do
2012-05-22T17:58:00.000Z	dash	acicula	but it launches the installer gui on boot and doesn't offer me a chance to get at a commandline :)
2012-05-22T17:59:00.000Z	dash	acicula	i don't have a live cd, i have a microsd card with an installer image on it
2012-05-22T18:00:00.000Z	acicula	dash	just the kernel and initrd or something?
2012-05-22T18:00:00.000Z	dash	acicula	this: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ARM/MX5/QuickStart
2012-05-22T18:00:00.000Z	acicula	dash	right
