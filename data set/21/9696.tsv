2005-09-13T16:37:00.000Z	Daemonic		how might I go about disabling some things I don't need during the bootup process..?
2005-09-13T16:39:00.000Z	Daemonic		holy crap
2005-09-13T16:40:00.000Z	Daemonic		way too much of my memory is being used.. this is /no/ good. =\
2005-09-13T16:40:00.000Z	deFrysk	Daemonic	linux uses your ram optimally
2005-09-13T16:41:00.000Z	deFrysk	Daemonic	unused ram is wasted ram
2005-09-13T16:42:00.000Z	Daemonic	deFrysk	well, compared to the many other distros I use this one is using way too much.. I only noticed because the gnome is getting slower and the swap is being used more and more.
2005-09-13T16:42:00.000Z	deFrysk	Daemonic	running java apps perhaps ?
2005-09-13T16:42:00.000Z	Daemonic	deFrysk	negative.
2005-09-13T16:43:00.000Z	deFrysk	Daemonic	run top and check what is using your swap
2005-09-20T13:53:00.000Z	deFrysk	Daemonic	man apt will tell you
2005-09-20T13:53:00.000Z	Daemonic	deFrysk	I just did that and it says the -d flag but it keeps saying that five packages are marked for install...?
2005-09-20T13:54:00.000Z	deFrysk	Daemonic	install fakeroot and do fakeroot apt-get -d package
2005-09-20T13:56:00.000Z	Daemonic	deFrysk	ok, just tried that.. it's giving me an invalid operation error
2005-09-20T13:57:00.000Z	deFrysk	Daemonic	waht gave you that ?
2005-09-20T13:57:00.000Z	deFrysk	Daemonic	dit you install fakeroot ?
2005-09-20T13:58:00.000Z	Daemonic	deFrysk	~ # fakeroot apt-get -d linux-image-686-smp
2005-09-20T13:58:00.000Z	Daemonic	deFrysk	~ # apt-get -d linux-image-686-smp
2005-09-20T13:58:00.000Z	deFrysk	Daemonic	is synaptic open ?
2005-09-20T13:58:00.000Z	Daemonic	deFrysk	no. I don't use synaptic..
2005-09-20T14:01:00.000Z	Daemonic	deFrysk	ok. that seems to have worked but it says.. The following NEW packages will be installed:
2005-09-20T14:02:00.000Z	Daemonic	deFrysk	I don't want to /install/ it.. I want to retrieve it.
