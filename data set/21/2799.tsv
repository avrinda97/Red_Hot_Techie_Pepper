2009-11-07T20:06:00.000Z	om26er1	filgy	yes the memory card is inserted at boot
2009-11-07T20:06:00.000Z	om26er1	filgy	but still can't boot. but if memory card is inserted to a memory card reader then i can boot
2009-11-07T20:06:00.000Z	filgy	om26er1	if it's not in a memory card reader, where else are you inserting it ?
2009-11-07T20:07:00.000Z	om26er1	filgy	buitin card reader. and a usb card reader. works from usb card reader but not from internal card reader
2009-11-07T20:07:00.000Z	filgy	om26er1	ohh that's really strange.. i'm guessing you'll need to file a bug report
2009-11-07T20:08:00.000Z	om26er1	filgy	and also if i add mmc_core mmc_block sdhci sdhci-pci to the initrd then i can boot
2009-11-07T20:08:00.000Z	filgy	om26er1	does the builtin reader let you read another memory card once the system is booted? or is it not working at all?
2009-11-07T20:08:00.000Z	om26er1	filgy	yes works perfect
2009-11-07T20:09:00.000Z	om26er1	filgy	i want this bug to be reported here but cant find a way : https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/lucid/+bugs
2009-11-07T20:13:00.000Z	filgy	om26er1	what do you mean you can't find a way? there's a link right on that page that says report a bug
2009-11-07T20:14:00.000Z	om26er1	filgy	if i click it it takes me to: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs and ?no-redirect also don't work
2009-11-07T20:15:00.000Z	filgy	om26er1	did you follow the instructions on that page?
2009-11-07T20:18:00.000Z	om26er1	filgy	i have reported it but not in lynx: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/477482 it has been there the first day i started using ubuntu. and many tutorials on the internet have given solutions but giving initrd filled with these four modules should not be a bigger deal
2009-11-07T20:21:00.000Z	filgy	om26er1	dunno what to tell you.. wait for them to look at the bug
2009-11-07T20:22:00.000Z	filgy	om26er1	i agree that should fix it for that release though.. unless it maybe causes other problems..
2009-11-07T20:23:00.000Z	filgy	om26er1	you said you reported it for older releases? what were you told there? just to do the work around you mentioned?
2009-11-07T20:23:00.000Z	om26er1	filgy	never reported before i just faced it
2009-11-07T20:25:00.000Z	filgy	om26er1	so the bug you just filed is the first one ever filed for that issue? or there have been previous ones filed?
2009-11-07T20:26:00.000Z	om26er1	filgy	i have never filed this before. and also i have also added some references in the comments which give solutions. plz take a look in comments
2009-11-07T20:28:00.000Z	filgy	om26er1	i know i read it.. like i said i agree it should be fixed and the best way to make that happen is filing a bug so you did the right thing.. it's just a waiting thing now until the bug is looked at..
2009-11-07T20:29:00.000Z	om26er1	filgy	thanx
