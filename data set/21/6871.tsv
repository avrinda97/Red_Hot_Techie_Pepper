2007-05-14T08:48:00.000Z	Enverex	steel_lady	Ok thanks, you're kinda lacking the key thing I need though, nevermind.
2007-05-14T08:49:00.000Z	steel_lady	Enverex	can you tell me what is that thing and what does it serve for?
2007-05-14T08:50:00.000Z	Enverex	steel_lady	I need to find someone with the ATi X1300 or X1400 cards built in, I need to know if you can switch from the onboard to the discreet card via the BIOS
2007-05-14T08:51:00.000Z	Enverex	steel_lady	No... I need specific information that only someone with one of these laptops with those cards in could answer.
2007-05-14T08:52:00.000Z	Enverex	steel_lady	and I'm pretty sure Dell wouldn't have Linux drivers on their site anyway, not that I need them
2007-05-14T08:53:00.000Z	steel_lady	Enverex	I am sorry. Right now I am desperate myself because noone offers to help me and I tried everything I could alone
2007-05-14T08:58:00.000Z	Enverex	steel_lady	What exactly was your problem?
2007-05-14T08:59:00.000Z	steel_lady	Enverex	as I said somebody did something bad, so when you install pgplot through synaptic or manually, it doesn't pull dependencies nor compilers nor comiles and installs properly. and when I look for components I run into a wall. and all that I need to install another program that should be in repository but it is not!
2007-05-14T09:04:00.000Z	Enverex	steel_lady	Erm, you shouldn't need to compile stuff, that's why it's in precompiled packages
2007-05-14T09:04:00.000Z	Enverex	steel_lady	What version of Ubuntu?
2007-05-14T09:04:00.000Z	steel_lady	Enverex	I think I have Edgy
2007-05-14T09:06:00.000Z	Enverex	steel_lady	Right, so does it not work when you go into synaptic and tell it to install that package?
2007-05-14T09:07:00.000Z	steel_lady	Enverex	it 'works' but after that when I go to install the next thing, libraries that I am supposed to have, I son't
2007-05-14T09:11:00.000Z	Enverex	steel_lady	Are they key to running it or optional extras?
2007-05-14T09:12:00.000Z	steel_lady	Enverex	they are the very thing to run the other thing
2007-05-14T09:13:00.000Z	steel_lady	Enverex	I think that somebody did sbad ab because it does not do what it says in its descriptionout it in the packageomething principally
2007-05-14T09:14:00.000Z	steel_lady	Enverex	my keyboard is joking with me. So, something is wrong about that package and they should correct it
2007-05-14T09:14:00.000Z	Enverex	steel_lady	So file a bug
2007-05-14T09:22:00.000Z	Enverex	steel_lady	The Ubuntu bugs thing on Launchpad
