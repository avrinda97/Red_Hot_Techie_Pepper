2010-07-08T05:00:00.000Z	vock		I know for a fact my /home partition is 15 GB, and I am the only user on this computer, and when I go to the properties of my home directory in nautilus it's only at 300 MB, but I'm getting 14 GB is used with df -h on the command line. Any ideas what else takes up space on /home?
2010-07-08T05:02:00.000Z	sjm	vock	you can check on space by (in a terminal window): du -ba | sort -n
2010-07-08T05:02:00.000Z	sjm	vock	that should tell you what is taking up the space.
2010-07-08T05:03:00.000Z	vock	sjm	i'll check that out now, didn't know those commands
2010-07-08T05:03:00.000Z	sjm	vock	do you have nautilus set to show the hidden files?
2010-07-08T05:03:00.000Z	vock	sjm	wouldn't that still show up in used space? I'll double check
2010-07-08T05:04:00.000Z	sjm	vock	du will show you all files and folders and the space they use.
2010-07-08T05:04:00.000Z	sjm	vock	turn on the hidden files option in nautilus to see ALL the files.
2010-07-08T05:05:00.000Z	vock	sjm	did that it's still showing only 300 MB
2010-07-08T05:05:00.000Z	sjm	vock	did which?
2010-07-08T05:06:00.000Z	vock	sjm	i just did it in nautilus, i'm checking du now
2010-07-08T05:07:00.000Z	sjm	vock	you can limit the depth of the tree du searches like this: du -ba --max-depth=1 | sort -n
2010-07-08T05:09:00.000Z	sjm	vock	it depends, du -b does
2010-07-08T05:09:00.000Z	sjm	vock	-ba says, show in bytes and all files (not just directories).
2010-07-08T05:10:00.000Z	vock	sjm	ActionParsnip, ah, thanks guys, I found it
2010-07-08T05:10:00.000Z	sjm	vock	sort will order them so the largest is last.
2010-07-08T05:10:00.000Z	sjm	vock	good you found it.
2010-07-08T05:11:00.000Z	vock	sjm	ActionParsnip, how do you guys remember all the little utilities to do stuff like this?
2010-07-08T05:11:00.000Z	sjm	vock	work more on the command line than in the gui
2010-07-08T05:12:00.000Z	vock	sjm	ActionParsnip, maco, thanks guys for your help
2010-07-08T05:13:00.000Z	sjm	vock	you're welcome
