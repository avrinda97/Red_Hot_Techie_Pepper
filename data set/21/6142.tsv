2007-05-27T09:03:00.000Z	silent_		hey guys, I'm used to righ click dragging stuff to create 'shortcuts'. As far as I understand the linux equivalent is a link. How do I create these links?
2007-05-27T09:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	silent_	 a 'link' is much different from a shortcut. :)
2007-05-27T09:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	silent_	 but in many cases they sort of serve the same function
2007-05-27T09:04:00.000Z	silent_	dr_willis	how can I make a shortcut to a directory?
2007-05-27T09:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	silent_	 'ln -s whatever whever'
2007-05-27T09:04:00.000Z	silent_	dr_willis	with the gui
2007-05-27T09:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	silent_	 and i always gets them backwards  as for a gui.. no clue. i dont need the gui
2007-05-27T09:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	silent_	 i seem to recall the gnome file manager dident have that feature. kde's did.
2007-05-27T09:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	silent_	  ln -s /home/whoever/desktop/smb /media/themountpoint
2007-05-27T09:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	silent_	 that command may have the arguments backwards.. i always gets it backwards
2007-05-27T09:10:00.000Z	silent_	dr_willis	do I need to create a file to be the link or will ln create the file? I'm getting a 'file does not exist' error
2007-05-27T09:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	silent_	 yoyu proberly got it backwards then.. practice with some with the command
2007-05-28T11:02:00.000Z	dr_willis	silent_	 $5 a month - but its like $30 minim the furst time.
2007-05-28T11:02:00.000Z	dr_willis	silent_	 decently reasonable if you use it a lot.
2007-05-28T11:02:00.000Z	dr_willis	silent_	 but wine is getting better evbery week also
2007-05-28T11:02:00.000Z	silent_	dr_willis	wine is severely lacking
2007-05-28T11:03:00.000Z	dr_willis	silent_	 depends on your specific needs
2007-05-28T11:03:00.000Z	dr_willis	silent_	 theres more to life then games. :)
2007-05-28T11:03:00.000Z	silent_	dr_willis	I do a lot of cutting edge gaming, considering my hardware
2007-05-28T11:04:00.000Z	silent_	dr_willis	I know there is more to life than games. I'm running Linux, isn't that indication enough? :P
2007-05-28T11:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	silent_	 from what im seeing the next cutting edge games will be a Huge hassle for cedega and wine.
