2005-10-25T06:59:00.000Z	KinkoBlast		Is there an easy way to install vlc on Ubuntu? I use VLC on every other computer, so I want to use it here, too.

2005-10-25T07:01:00.000Z	nalioth	KinkoBlast	ubotu has gifted you with lots of info
2005-10-25T07:02:00.000Z	KinkoBlast	nalioth	OK. Thanks!
2005-10-25T07:13:00.000Z	nalioth	KinkoBlast	keep religion and swearing out of the channel please
2005-10-25T07:24:00.000Z	nalioth	KinkoBlast	please dont use "easyubuntu"
2005-10-25T07:25:00.000Z	nalioth	KinkoBlast	then congratulations!
2005-10-25T15:54:00.000Z	nalioth	KinkoBlast	why cant they?
2005-10-25T15:54:00.000Z	nalioth	KinkoBlast	with the proper libs, totem can play any a/v media
2005-10-25T15:55:00.000Z	KinkoBlast	nalioth	Well, screw that. You SHOULD be able to play music out of the box. Even WINDOWS does that. Or at the least it should tell you why not.

2005-10-25T15:56:00.000Z	KinkoBlast	nalioth	It just gives a generic error.
2005-10-25T15:56:00.000Z	KinkoBlast	nalioth	I KNOW!
2005-10-25T15:57:00.000Z	KinkoBlast	nalioth	It SHOULD give a decent error message though. like "Oops! I can't play MP3s, check out http://wiki.ubuntu.com/wiki/RestrictedFormats for more information."
2005-10-25T15:57:00.000Z	nalioth	KinkoBlast	that is a good idea
2005-10-26T16:20:00.000Z	nalioth	KinkoBlast	a terminal? many of them
2005-10-26T16:21:00.000Z	nalioth	KinkoBlast	or maybe you mean 'dosemu' to emulate an actuall dos environment
2005-10-26T16:21:00.000Z	KinkoBlast	nalioth	There is such a thing?
2005-10-26T16:21:00.000Z	nalioth	KinkoBlast	yes watch ubotu
2005-10-26T16:21:00.000Z	KinkoBlast	nalioth	That wasn't what I ment, but that would be sweet! (I like Lemmings!)
2005-10-26T16:29:00.000Z	nalioth	KinkoBlast	hit alt-f2 and type "xkill" the next window you touch, dies
