2007-05-18T16:37:00.000Z	Cubey		does ANYONE have a rough cpu req for youtube to perform properly under ubuntu/firefox? my video card should be able to handle it, and it's accelerated
2007-05-18T16:37:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Cubey	it's probably your flash version
2007-05-18T16:37:00.000Z	Cubey	ubuntu_	finally, someone answers! I asked that a while ago, if it might be the plugin
2007-05-18T16:38:00.000Z	Cubey	ubuntu_	how do i check the plugin version?
2007-05-18T16:38:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Cubey	Yeah what plugin do you have installed?
2007-05-18T16:38:00.000Z	Cubey	ubuntu_	er, flash i suppose *lol*
2007-05-18T16:38:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Cubey	You didn't install it?
2007-05-18T16:38:00.000Z	Cubey	ubuntu_	might have last night when i was half asleep ;)
2007-05-18T16:39:00.000Z	Cubey	ubuntu_	I don't recall if it ws something installed after ubuntu or if it came with it
2007-05-18T16:40:00.000Z	Cubey	ubuntu_	OH! now i remember, i did install it. not sure of the source I got it from...
2007-05-18T16:41:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Cubey	/me face palms
2007-05-18T16:42:00.000Z	Cubey	ubuntu_	okay, got it. it's flash player 9
2007-05-18T16:42:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Cubey	I think that should be okk
2007-05-18T16:43:00.000Z	Cubey	ubuntu_	you would think a 1GHz CPU should be able to handle it, and the video card. I have no problem with local AVIs
2007-05-18T16:43:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Cubey	It's probably bandwidth then
2007-05-18T16:44:00.000Z	Cubey	ubuntu_	nahhh, the video rendering is lagged
2007-05-18T16:44:00.000Z	Cubey	ubuntu_	if i lower the quality, it reduces the lag a bit
2007-05-18T16:44:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Cubey	That's kinda strange
2007-05-18T16:45:00.000Z	Cubey	ubuntu_	Yeah.. I may just have to try another browser perhaps...
2007-05-18T16:55:00.000Z	ubuntu_	Cubey	Oh trust me you can make it so
2007-05-18T16:56:00.000Z	Cubey	ubuntu_	That's probably true. But more bloated than XP? I get better performance out of XP than I ever do from linux, for some reason...
