2009-01-31T18:18:00.000Z	transporter		.rar file asking for a password what should i do?
2009-01-31T18:19:00.000Z	Dr_willis	transporter	  find the password?   Lots of 'questionable' sites/sources  do that..   some give urls to get the password that lead to xxx/spyware/virus sites so be warey
2009-01-31T18:20:00.000Z	transporter	Dr_willis	thanx but i don't need a virus right now
2009-01-31T18:20:00.000Z	Dr_willis	transporter	 of course thats one reason to use linux. :) its proberly not a problem.. but I would find the contents of that .rar file to be questionable also  -  But its your pc. ;)
2009-01-31T18:21:00.000Z	transporter	Dr_willis	well i just downloaded bach the whole collection
2009-01-31T18:34:00.000Z	Dr_willis	transporter	 we dont know how to crack a rar password.. Not sure its even doable..
2009-01-31T18:35:00.000Z	Dr_willis	transporter	 check the site ya got th file from and it may mention the password
2009-02-20T17:59:00.000Z	Dr_willis	transporter	 that was a vague answer.. :) custiomuize in what way?
2009-02-20T18:00:00.000Z	Dr_willis	transporter	 yes.. thats trivial to set up.. install 'ccsm' and play witht he settings it lets you change.
2009-02-20T18:01:00.000Z	transporter	Dr_willis	yeah i have ccsm but i don't know which option enables me to do that
2009-02-20T18:01:00.000Z	Dr_willis	transporter	 under animations I belive.. compiz has lots of docs online and a support channel as well
2009-02-20T18:02:00.000Z	Dr_willis	transporter	 i just set mine to be 'random' :) then i get sick of it all and set them to be none.
2009-02-20T18:03:00.000Z	transporter	Dr_willis	do u know which one allows me to fold it like the origami paper
2009-02-20T18:04:00.000Z	Dr_willis	transporter	 i belive its called the airplane effect.. or paperplane..  its rather obvious once ya see its name
2009-02-20T18:04:00.000Z	Dr_willis	transporter	 fire up ccsm tweak the settings.. try it out.. play with it some more.
2009-02-20T18:05:00.000Z	transporter	Dr_willis	ActionParsnip im checking
2009-02-20T18:10:00.000Z	Dr_willis	transporter	 No idea.  selexct it.. use the apply ior whatever buttion, then try minimizing a window.  You just have to toy with it..
2009-02-20T18:10:00.000Z	Dr_willis	transporter	 or you are setting it for a close, or other 'event' - I dont use COmpiz much at all.. and when i do i dont use those silly effects.
2009-02-20T18:10:00.000Z	transporter	Dr_willis	there is no apply button just a close button but still the damn thing won't work
2009-02-20T18:11:00.000Z	transporter	Dr_willis	 yeah i think so i thankyou very much for ur help :D ActionParsnip too
