2012-09-08T05:34:00.000Z	[snake]		I'm sad :< is it possible I got hacked at all?
2012-09-08T05:36:00.000Z	tomreyn	[snake]	it's more likely you accidentially misconfigured something.
2012-09-08T05:37:00.000Z	[snake]	tomreyn	ok, I'll check when I get home for ssh configuration. Maybe I limited how many connections in a day or something???
2012-09-08T05:37:00.000Z	tomreyn	[snake]	can you ssh Or just netcat or even ping it, still?
2012-09-08T05:38:00.000Z	[snake]	tomreyn	I still get http. Idk how to netcat or ping(ping port 22) on windowz
2012-09-08T05:38:00.000Z	tomreyn	[snake]	it's unlikely that you accidentially set up rate limiting.
2012-09-08T05:39:00.000Z	tomreyn	[snake]	oh you're on windows. well you can ping at least then, but if http still works (sorry ou said so) this isn't worth testing.
2012-09-08T05:39:00.000Z	[snake]	tomreyn	I don't remember doing it haha. but I'm not sure what the issue is.
2012-09-08T05:40:00.000Z	tomreyn	[snake]	if you have telnet (client) installed you can try to: telnet <server_IP> 22
2012-09-08T05:40:00.000Z	[snake]	tomreyn	yeah. http still works I just can't ssh
2012-09-08T05:45:00.000Z	[snake]	tomreyn	My school blocked telnet on this laptop... which is dumb because they gave the laptop to the student and clean it out completely for each student.
2012-09-08T05:46:00.000Z	[snake]	tomreyn	I will have to do it at home. thanks for helping
2012-09-08T20:58:00.000Z	[snake]	tomreyn	I fixed my computer... it froze... but I'm not sure how I got http from it haha
2012-09-08T21:03:00.000Z	tomreyn	[snake]	i'm not sure what you're referring to
2012-09-08T21:03:00.000Z	[snake]	tomreyn	didn't you help me yesterday?
2012-09-08T21:04:00.000Z	tomreyn	[snake]	oh, yes, that's possible. my memory isn't great, but your name rings one of a couple of bells.
2012-09-08T21:04:00.000Z	[snake]	tomreyn	yesterday I was the one that had the ssh putty problem but I could still get http
2012-09-08T21:04:00.000Z	tomreyn	[snake]	ah, now i remember
2012-09-08T21:04:00.000Z	[snake]	tomreyn	haha yeah. I like [snake] :)
2012-09-08T21:05:00.000Z	tomreyn	[snake]	glad you were able to solve it. still, a server shouldn't freeze, so the problem is only half fixed, i guess ;)
2012-09-08T21:06:00.000Z	[snake]	tomreyn	yeah. :P
