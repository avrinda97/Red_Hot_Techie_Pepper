2007-05-26T09:58:00.000Z	Solust		Anyone know how to get a linksys Wireless G PCI Adapter model WMP54G working on Feisty?  It uses a passcode that isn't typical for most wireless networks.
2007-05-26T09:59:00.000Z	wastedfluid	Solust	I would change the WEP...
2007-05-26T09:59:00.000Z	wastedfluid	Solust	What kind of WEP security does your router use?
2007-05-26T10:00:00.000Z	wastedfluid	Solust	WPA Personal is what what says?  Your Network manager, or your routr?
2007-05-26T10:01:00.000Z	Solust	wastedfluid	 I'm not sure the XP program that came with the wireless card says that its WPA Personal under security
2007-05-26T10:02:00.000Z	wastedfluid	Solust	 Nevermind what XP Says.  What kind of securtiy do you have setup on your router?
2007-05-26T10:03:00.000Z	Solust	wastedfluid	 well there was none until I set up the wireless card on my system.  I also use the WPA Personal to use my PSP on the same network
2007-05-26T10:04:00.000Z	wastedfluid	Solust	 WPA Peronsal is Wi-Fi, I believe
2007-05-26T10:05:00.000Z	wastedfluid	Solust	How many groups of characters is your password?
2007-05-26T10:07:00.000Z	wastedfluid	Solust	 What Network Manager are you using to connect?
2007-05-26T10:08:00.000Z	Solust	wastedfluid	 Getting Feisty to work with a Wireless G PCI Adapter model WMP54G
2007-05-26T10:09:00.000Z	Solust	wastedfluid	 I can't find passcode right now....  I'll keep searching
2007-05-26T10:10:00.000Z	wastedfluid	Solust	Okay.  I think for WPA Personal, you mgiht want to try wlassistant.
2007-05-26T10:12:00.000Z	Solust	wastedfluid	 will I be able to get it without access to the network though?
2007-05-26T10:13:00.000Z	wastedfluid	Solust	I'm not sure what you're asking.  I'm pretty sure wlassistant uses WPA Personal.. it's for wifi..
2007-05-26T10:13:00.000Z	wastedfluid	Solust	sudo apt-get install wlassistant
2007-05-26T10:14:00.000Z	Solust	wastedfluid	 alright I'll try it but I would think I would need the internet to get it ya?
2007-05-26T10:14:00.000Z	wastedfluid	Solust	yes.  you will.
2007-05-26T10:15:00.000Z	wastedfluid	Solust	Just download the source file, and install it.. it's not a big application
2007-05-26T10:15:00.000Z	Solust	wastedfluid	 Thanks!!  You helped me out alot
2007-05-26T10:15:00.000Z	wastedfluid	Solust	np man.  good luck.
