2005-06-28T14:01:00.000Z	justin	Flying-Llama	/etc/network/interfaces
2005-06-28T14:21:00.000Z	justin	Flying-Llama	you shouldn't be touching modprobe.conf
2005-06-28T14:21:00.000Z	justin	Flying-Llama	fedora != ubuntu
2005-06-28T14:52:00.000Z	justin	Flying-Llama	just run ifconfig eth1 10.0.1.5
2005-06-28T14:53:00.000Z	Flying-Llama	justin	i still have no signal
2005-06-28T14:54:00.000Z	justin	Flying-Llama	well typing random ifconfig commands isn't going to help you if your not even associated to the AP
2005-06-28T14:56:00.000Z	justin	Flying-Llama	your access point doesn't use dhcp?
2005-06-28T14:56:00.000Z	justin	Flying-Llama	then why are you trying to set it up manually?
2005-06-28T14:57:00.000Z	justin	Flying-Llama	what does iwconfig say?
2005-06-28T14:58:00.000Z	justin	Flying-Llama	does it have the correct ESSID and mac address of the access point?
2005-06-28T14:59:00.000Z	justin	Flying-Llama	all 4's means that it is not associated
