2010-02-21T14:17:00.000Z	newbie		so the ubuntu is the different than zorin
2010-02-21T14:18:00.000Z	newbie		i would like to know what is more suitable for my laptop and my needs
2010-02-21T14:19:00.000Z	newbie		my system is Dell inspiron laptop and its 1.4 processor and 512 ram
2010-02-21T14:21:00.000Z	archboxman	newbie	since your processor is a bit slow and you lack memory consider using a windows manager with what ever linux distro you chioce
2010-02-21T14:23:00.000Z	newbie	archboxman	you mean that the windows interface is more suitable for my system
2010-02-21T14:23:00.000Z	archboxman	newbie	check out distrowatch.com
2010-02-21T14:23:00.000Z	archboxman	newbie	this is kinda a hard way to learn
2010-02-21T14:25:00.000Z	archboxman	newbie	there is crunchbag linux, linux mint also has fluxbox, again any of windows managers are not that friendly try maybe XFCE
2010-02-21T14:26:00.000Z	archboxman	newbie	need to burn a copy of iso to cd or dvd and play with the distro's
2010-02-21T14:26:00.000Z	newbie	archboxman	if i do not like to use a windows manager so what to use
2010-02-21T14:28:00.000Z	archboxman	newbie	here follow this link http://xwinman.org/
2010-02-21T14:30:00.000Z	newbie	archboxman	so if its not "window manager" what should it be? "terminal manager"?
2010-02-21T14:30:00.000Z	archboxman	newbie	desktop enviroment
2010-02-21T14:32:00.000Z	archboxman	newbie	think of it this way windows manager = lot of setup  desktop enviroment = gui plus point and click like in windows
2010-02-21T14:33:00.000Z	newbie	archboxman	now my OS is depending on desktop environment
2010-02-21T14:35:00.000Z	archboxman	newbie	go to google search xfce and select images gives you idea on desktop enviroment with limited resources usage
2010-02-21T14:36:00.000Z	archboxman	newbie	look at this http://images.google.com/images?um=1&hl=en&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&gbv=2&tbs=isch%3A1&sa=1&q=lxde&aq=f&oq=&aqi=g1&start=0
2010-02-21T14:37:00.000Z	archboxman	newbie	the most important thig you can do in using linux is google search topics
