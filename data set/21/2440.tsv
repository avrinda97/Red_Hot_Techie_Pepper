2009-11-10T07:14:00.000Z	iarp		is there anyway to count the number of items in a grep, but only show teh total not entire list of junk
2009-11-10T07:15:00.000Z	usser	iarp	grep match filename | wc -l
2009-11-10T07:15:00.000Z	iarp	usser	ty
2009-11-10T07:15:00.000Z	iarp	usser	is that -L lower cased?
2009-11-10T07:15:00.000Z	usser	iarp	yea
2009-11-10T07:18:00.000Z	iarp	usser	whats the proper way to write "ll /home/user/opent/opent/ | grep *.c " now do i add "| wc -l" with without the pipe
2009-11-10T07:19:00.000Z	usser	iarp	ls /home/user/opent/opent | grep "*.c" | wc -l
2009-11-10T07:19:00.000Z	usser	iarp	assuming ll in your command means ls
2009-11-10T07:22:00.000Z	iarp	usser	odd, it reports only 1/2 of whats actully in the folder
2009-11-10T07:25:00.000Z	usser	iarp	hm
2009-11-10T07:26:00.000Z	usser	iarp	thats strange
2009-11-10T07:26:00.000Z	iarp	usser	ya, dont worry about it now anyways, just opened a new window and did it within the folder and it reported proper number
2009-11-10T07:28:00.000Z	usser	iarp	ah sorry you have to use egrep or grep -E to be able to write stuff like grep -E -i "*.c" filename
2009-11-10T07:28:00.000Z	usser	iarp	so in your case ls | grep -E -i "*.c" | wc -l
2009-11-10T07:28:00.000Z	iarp	usser	writing to what though?
2009-11-10T07:29:00.000Z	usser	iarp	what do you mean writing to what?
2009-11-10T07:29:00.000Z	iarp	usser	well you sad "use egrep or grep -E to be able to write stuff"
2009-11-10T07:31:00.000Z	usser	iarp	i meant in order to match stuff like "*.c" you have to use egrep, grep doesnt allow regular expression, so you could write grep .c but that would give you lines where there's .c lines like hello.carl.html would be matched
2009-11-10T07:31:00.000Z	iarp	usser	ahh gotchya ty
2009-11-10T07:31:00.000Z	usser	iarp	i dunno if that makes it clear, you gotta excuse my english
2009-11-10T07:32:00.000Z	iarp	usser	makes sence now, i misread it and didnt realise you meant as in myself writing it
