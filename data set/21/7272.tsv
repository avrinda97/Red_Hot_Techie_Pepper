2006-12-23T13:20:00.000Z	cbruno		do programs compiled for the .NET runtime run on the mono runtime?
2006-12-23T13:20:00.000Z	calvarez	cbruno	yes, as long as the libraries are
2006-12-23T13:20:00.000Z	calvarez	cbruno	what are you looking for?
2006-12-23T13:21:00.000Z	calvarez	cbruno	are you looking for a GUI toolkit?
2006-12-23T13:23:00.000Z	calvarez	cbruno	I have been doing the same research you;re doing right now
2006-12-23T13:23:00.000Z	calvarez	cbruno	if you want a toolkit that is crossplatform, use wxWindows
2006-12-23T13:23:00.000Z	calvarez	cbruno	it is more portable than GTK
2006-12-23T13:24:00.000Z	calvarez	cbruno	right out of the box
2006-12-23T13:24:00.000Z	calvarez	cbruno	what languages do you know?
2006-12-23T13:25:00.000Z	calvarez	cbruno	btw, wxWidgets is the name
2006-12-23T13:25:00.000Z	calvarez	cbruno	you can do the development in C/C++ if you wish, but in python it would be even faster and less of a hassle
2006-12-23T13:26:00.000Z	calvarez	cbruno	check out wxPython
2006-12-23T13:26:00.000Z	calvarez	cbruno	Qt4 allows you to use Qt in Windows for free if you're making Open Source software
2006-12-23T13:26:00.000Z	calvarez	cbruno	but if you prefer to use something not as restrictive as the GPL, then wxWidgets is a good option
2006-12-23T13:27:00.000Z	calvarez	cbruno	then you should use either wxWidgets or GTK+
2006-12-23T13:28:00.000Z	calvarez	cbruno	also there are RAD tools for wxWidgets with code generation in several languages as well
2006-12-23T13:30:00.000Z	calvarez	cbruno	there is an Open Source library called Report.Net for Python that makes .pdf files
2006-12-23T13:30:00.000Z	calvarez	cbruno	any specific reason to spit out a .tex instead of generating a .pdf instead>
2006-12-23T13:32:00.000Z	calvarez	cbruno	sounds like a cool idea
2006-12-23T13:33:00.000Z	calvarez	cbruno	I would use python for that app. Then it is really cross-platform
2006-12-23T13:33:00.000Z	calvarez	cbruno	and for the GUI would could use wxPython or PyGTK
