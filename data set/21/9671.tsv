2005-08-07T15:17:00.000Z	shammy		could someone help me get my wireless internet up and running? I looked under device manager and the netgear adapter is listed, so it's recognizing it.. what else do I need to do?
2005-08-07T15:18:00.000Z	vader1102	shammy	do you have internet connection?
2005-08-07T15:18:00.000Z	shammy	vader1102	available? or on ubuntu

2005-08-07T15:19:00.000Z	vader1102	shammy	try iwlist scan and tell me if it sees the router
2005-08-07T15:20:00.000Z	shammy	vader1102	it says none of my devices support scanning
2005-08-07T15:21:00.000Z	shammy	vader1102	even though it is recognized as the right adapter in device manager, that doesn't mean it is set up for internet access though does it?
