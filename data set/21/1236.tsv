2011-02-12T05:54:00.000Z	torrancew	induz	ffmpeg is a CLI program - it probably won't give you a shortcut by default
2011-02-12T05:59:00.000Z	torrancew	induz	what do you want to convert .ogg to?
2011-02-12T06:01:00.000Z	torrancew	induz	what are you experiencing on sound converter that is stopping you?
2011-02-12T06:02:00.000Z	induz	torrancew	sound converter even can not read from the CD
2011-02-12T06:02:00.000Z	torrancew	induz	for each file named <something>.ogg (referred to as "name"), you will run ffmpeg -i <original-file> <original-file>.mp3
2011-02-12T06:03:00.000Z	torrancew	induz	which, I'm assuming, is the ffmpeg syntax to convert the file, but it's been a long time since I've used ffmpeg
2011-02-12T06:03:00.000Z	induz	torrancew	what u use to convert .ogg files/tracks to MP3
2011-02-12T06:04:00.000Z	torrancew	induz	to be honest... I don't - I'm all Linux
2011-02-12T06:07:00.000Z	torrancew	induz	sox has a similar, easy to use syntax
2011-02-12T06:17:00.000Z	torrancew	induz	glad you got it working :)
2011-02-12T06:18:00.000Z	induz	torrancew	soundconverter takes a track at a time, but it was not reading from the CD. i saved it on Banshee
