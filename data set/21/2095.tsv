2010-02-04T00:58:00.000Z	Pici	zilkomaa	Just ask your question, please don't point the bot at me for no reason.
2010-02-04T00:59:00.000Z	zilkomaa	Pici	Ok, sorry about that.
2010-02-04T01:00:00.000Z	zilkomaa	Pici	Do u know any good tip or tweaks for 64 bit ubuntu 9.10?
2010-02-04T01:00:00.000Z	Pici	zilkomaa	What kind of tips or tweaks?
2010-02-04T01:01:00.000Z	zilkomaa	Pici	Like...how to make the system faster etc...and take all advantage of it
2010-02-04T01:02:00.000Z	Pici	zilkomaa	I don't have any suggestions on that subject, perhaps someone else in the channel does though.
2010-02-04T01:03:00.000Z	zilkomaa	Pici	I have athlon x2 64 5600+ , 2gb 800 dual channel, and 8800gtx.
2010-02-04T01:03:00.000Z	zilkomaa	Pici	Okay, thank you anyway!
2010-02-04T01:05:00.000Z	zilkomaa		Hmm Pici.. maybe you can help me about other thing its about mplayer..
2010-02-04T01:06:00.000Z	zilkomaa	Pici	I'll have read all the instructions on web sites, and still cant get the mplayer work. I crashes and reports signal error 11
2010-02-04T01:06:00.000Z	Pici	zilkomaa	Just direct your question to the channel, and not me, you'll have a better chance of someone answering the question.  (I'm more of a vlc person than mplayer anyway)
2010-02-04T01:07:00.000Z	zilkomaa	Pici	Ok, tru that i use it too now days, because i get that tearing thing go away =)
2010-02-04T01:08:00.000Z	zilkomaa	Pici	Do you use ubuntu?
2010-02-04T01:09:00.000Z	Pici	zilkomaa	I do.
2010-02-04T01:09:00.000Z	zilkomaa	Pici	9.10, 32 or 64 bit?
2010-02-04T01:09:00.000Z	Pici	zilkomaa	9.10 desktop and server, both 32bit and I'm testing 32bit 10.04.
2010-02-04T01:10:00.000Z	zilkomaa	Pici	OK, hows that 10.04 feels?
2010-02-04T01:11:00.000Z	Pici	zilkomaa	buggy.  This is not really on-topic for this channel though.  I'm in #ubuntu-offtopic if you want to continue though
