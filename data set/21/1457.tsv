2010-09-06T13:26:00.000Z	__good_day_		Hello friends, I am trying to install ubuntu as guest using vmware. I had issue with the installation, after the minimum installtion the setup reboots the guest OS(ubuntu 10.01.1) and then a purple screen appears. After that login prompt comes. What to do now ?
2010-09-06T13:28:00.000Z	codebrainz	__good_day_	pick your username, enter your password and press Enter
2010-09-06T13:29:00.000Z	__good_day_	codebrainz	login incorrect.
2010-09-06T13:30:00.000Z	codebrainz	__good_day_	did you setup a user during install?
2010-09-06T13:49:00.000Z	__good_day_	codebrainz	When I configure virtual machine in vmware, I entered username/pass. I tried that and it is working. Thank you. The installation process didnt ask anything performs - installing additional components, network detect, dhcp configration, settingup clock, formatting partition, installing base system.
2010-09-06T13:50:00.000Z	__good_day_	codebrainz	I got into linux prompt after login. Its command prompt, how to get graphical screen. do I need to install anything for start. Startx is not working.
2010-09-06T13:52:00.000Z	codebrainz	__good_day_	which install CD did you use?
2010-09-06T13:52:00.000Z	__good_day_	codebrainz	ubuntu-10.04.1-alternate-amd64.iso, running i3 processor
2010-09-06T13:53:00.000Z	codebrainz	__good_day_	did you install "command line only" system?
2010-09-06T13:53:00.000Z	__good_day_	codebrainz	No, it didnt ask anything and install on its own. I am not sure where to do the required setting
2010-09-06T13:55:00.000Z	codebrainz	__good_day_	try 'apt-get install xorg ubuntu-desktop'
2010-09-06T13:57:00.000Z	__good_day_	codebrainz	it needs administrative priviliges to execute the command. I am loggin in as ubuntu@ubuntu. I havenot entered anywhere the root password while installation or configuring the virtual machine. Any way i get login as root or run su command.
2010-09-06T13:58:00.000Z	__good_day_	codebrainz	any default root password
2010-09-06T13:58:00.000Z	codebrainz	__good_day_	sudo apt-get install ...
2010-09-06T13:59:00.000Z	codebrainz	__good_day_	it sounds like you're running the live system though and not the installed one, you should've been asked to setup a user
2010-09-06T14:00:00.000Z	__good_day_	codebrainz	ooh.. Yes, How to make sure I am running live system. Also your command works and I have been asked to install a lot of packages of around 2 GB.
2010-09-06T14:01:00.000Z	codebrainz	__good_day_	it will all be for nothing if you're running the live system
2010-09-06T14:01:00.000Z	codebrainz	__good_day_	probably easier just to reinstall using the Desktop CD
2010-09-06T14:04:00.000Z	__good_day_	codebrainz	I got you, Instead of downloading desktop one, I have downloaded alternate iso image. Let me download the desktop and install again. Thank you a Lot..
2010-09-06T14:05:00.000Z	__good_day_	codebrainz	downloading http://releases.ubuntu.com/lucid/ubuntu-10.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso image now.
2010-09-06T14:05:00.000Z	codebrainz	__good_day_	yep, it should be much friendlier if you are kinda new
