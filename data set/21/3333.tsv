2009-01-23T09:15:00.000Z	tmg1|taylor		yes
2009-01-23T09:15:00.000Z	tmg1|taylor		i'v egotten two viruses in a week on two different flavours of linux
2009-01-23T09:15:00.000Z	tmg1|taylor		all of my debian/ubuntu boxes have been pwned
2009-01-23T09:15:00.000Z	tmg1|taylor		right out of the box for this system
2009-01-23T09:15:00.000Z	tmg1|taylor		Linux.RST.b for the last one, not sure about this one
2009-01-23T09:16:00.000Z	tmg1|taylor		I made, for a little while last night, a user with username/password easy to type(and therefor guess)
2009-01-23T09:16:00.000Z	tmg1|taylor		I deleted the username shortly thereafter but was already compromised
2009-01-23T09:16:00.000Z	tmg1|taylor		so yes, my fault...but still.
2009-01-23T09:17:00.000Z	tmg1|taylor		scripts etc
2009-01-23T09:17:00.000Z	tmg1|taylor		debsums reported a bunch of files changed, I've replaced those and now debsums doesn't complain anymore
2009-01-23T09:19:00.000Z	X-722	tmg1|taylor	Might I suggest a cloak? I mean, I dont even know you, but I know you are hooked to regina.ca
2009-01-23T09:20:00.000Z	tmg1|taylor	X-722	i have a website, usually
2009-01-23T09:21:00.000Z	tmg1|taylor	X-722	i'm a musician
2009-01-23T09:22:00.000Z	tmg1|taylor	X-722	and I try to be generous---I have 100s of gigs of open source/creative commons/free software music, cultural materials and other data for download
2009-01-23T09:23:00.000Z	tmg1|taylor	X-722	yes, all of this on boxes that have been rooted :(
2009-01-23T09:24:00.000Z	tmg1|taylor	X-722	first time I've ever had this kind of problem was this week
2009-01-23T09:25:00.000Z	tmg1|taylor	X-722	that last part I don't follow
2009-01-23T09:25:00.000Z	tmg1|taylor	X-722	from brute forcing passwords?
2009-01-23T09:29:00.000Z	tmg1|taylor	X-722	if need be I can disable ssh access...maybe find a 'cloaked' host to create a secure vpn with or something
2009-01-23T09:32:00.000Z	X-722	tmg1|taylor	I would do something man, because being rooted that quickly (or at all) would suck
2009-01-23T09:33:00.000Z	tmg1|taylor	X-722	best part is I have 300+ gigs of backups ...which spontaneously dissapeared this week too in the middle of the prairies.  just lost :)
