2006-08-31T05:00:00.000Z	sethk	marshall_	there are several strange things going on in your paste
2006-08-31T05:00:00.000Z	sethk	marshall_	the dbus stuff looks like the install didn't complete, or some part of the corba bus isn't there or isn't configured
2006-08-31T05:00:00.000Z	marshall_	sethk	yeah like that thing about my gtk engine "rezlooks"
2006-08-31T05:01:00.000Z	marshall_	sethk	what do you think i should do?
2006-08-31T05:02:00.000Z	sethk	marshall_	that's causing the segv, I'm sure, but it's inside the vm, I think
2006-08-31T05:02:00.000Z	marshall_	sethk	lol ok
2006-08-31T05:02:00.000Z	marshall_	sethk	im not sure what youre saying
2006-08-31T05:03:00.000Z	sethk	marshall_	I'm saying it's such a low level basic error that I can't say anything intelligent about it
2006-08-31T05:04:00.000Z	marshall_	sethk	lol i dont get it
2006-08-31T05:04:00.000Z	sethk	marshall_	It's looking for something and it can't find it, but I don't know enough about the internals of mono to know more than that
2006-08-31T05:04:00.000Z	marshall_	sethk	ohh
2006-08-31T05:04:00.000Z	marshall_	sethk	so its mono?
2006-08-31T05:05:00.000Z	sethk	marshall_	yes, that much we can see from the output, but you'll need someone who knows more about mono than I do to go any further with it
