2008-09-28T21:29:00.000Z	Kingsy101		I was wondering, how do you install lampp on ubuntu? I need apache mysql and preferably a FTP program of some sort... the reason I am asking is the last time I tried this it didnt go very well heh... so I thought I would get some good advice...
2008-09-28T21:30:00.000Z	dreamnid	Kingsy101	mm... it isn't that hard - what problems were you running into last time?
2008-09-28T21:31:00.000Z	Kingsy101	dreamnid	- well I ended up installing a third part version and it didnt go that well, then I tried to use tasksel and get some errors
2008-09-28T21:32:00.000Z	dreamnid	Kingsy101	Hmm... was that from these docs: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP ?
2008-09-28T21:33:00.000Z	dreamnid	Kingsy101	I never knew about the tasksel - seems pretty cool.   I did mine manually
2008-09-28T21:34:00.000Z	dreamnid	Kingsy101	I think I installed apache2, mysql5-server, mysql5-client, php5
2008-09-28T21:35:00.000Z	dreamnid	Kingsy101	I installed mine last week.
2008-09-28T21:35:00.000Z	dreamnid	Kingsy101	I'm assuming tasksel also install those packages for you.. so if something goes wrong, you can remove the packages
2008-09-28T21:36:00.000Z	dreamnid	Kingsy101	I would try it again and post here if something goes wrong ..
2008-09-28T21:59:00.000Z	dreamnid	Kingsy101	: umm I don't know
2008-09-28T22:01:00.000Z	dreamnid	Kingsy101	Yeah, install "sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin"
2008-09-28T22:04:00.000Z	dreamnid	Kingsy101	: Yeah
2008-09-28T22:06:00.000Z	dreamnid	Kingsy101	It is
2008-09-28T22:06:00.000Z	dreamnid	Kingsy101	you were right
2008-09-28T22:07:00.000Z	dreamnid	Kingsy101	root
2008-09-28T22:22:00.000Z	dreamnid	Kingsy101	/var/www/htdocs
2008-09-28T22:23:00.000Z	Kingsy101	dreamnid	- so I take it its not called htdocs with this istallation?
2008-09-28T22:24:00.000Z	dreamnid	Kingsy101	sorry, I guess it is /var/www
2008-09-28T22:25:00.000Z	dreamnid	Kingsy101	Personally, I would add a htdocs folder and edit /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/default and adjust the path accordingly.  That way, htdocs only contains files that the public can see, and you can have other folder to contain settings (such as db password)
2008-09-28T22:26:00.000Z	dreamnid	Kingsy101	You would need to reload apache "sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload" if you do edit the default file
2008-09-28T22:38:00.000Z	dreamnid	Kingsy101	- it's trying to find the server name to use - if the web server is not for public use, hen I wouldn't worry about it
