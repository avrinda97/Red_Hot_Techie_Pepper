2008-12-16T07:44:00.000Z	Panarchy		It's on the gparted liveCD
2008-12-16T07:44:00.000Z	Panarchy		or you can apt-get it to your ubuntu livecd

2008-12-16T07:47:00.000Z	Panarchy		What's the command to order packages by size?
2008-12-16T07:47:00.000Z	tritium	Panarchy	do *not* run what raylu just told you to do.
2008-12-16T07:47:00.000Z	Panarchy	tritium	Thanks for the advice, but I already knew
2008-12-16T07:57:00.000Z	tritium	Panarchy	please stop repeating!
2008-12-16T08:00:00.000Z	tritium	Panarchy	that won't do what you want
2008-12-16T08:01:00.000Z	tritium	Panarchy	use ls -lh for "human readable" ls output
2008-12-16T08:02:00.000Z	tritium	Panarchy	but again, that will give you the size of the .deb packages, and *not* the total size of all the unpacked files
2008-12-16T08:03:00.000Z	tritium	Panarchy	just try it
2008-12-16T08:03:00.000Z	tritium	Panarchy	you have been told about !enter *multiple* times
2008-12-16T08:04:00.000Z	tritium	Panarchy	the size of the .debs is irrelevant, as I've told you several times
2008-12-16T08:12:00.000Z	tritium	Panarchy	you rarely pay attention...
2008-12-16T08:38:00.000Z	tritium	Panarchy	please mind !enter from now on, and pay more attention, in general
