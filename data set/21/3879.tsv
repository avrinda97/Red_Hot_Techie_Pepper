2008-08-30T04:01:00.000Z	quaizar		oss issue with mic anyone have a post or direction they can point me in? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=902528 is a post I made but stuck
2008-08-30T04:02:00.000Z	quaizar		just wondering because i have creative card and can't get mic to work
2008-08-30T04:03:00.000Z	quaizar		no oss 4.1 and using 2 + sub
2008-08-30T04:05:00.000Z	quaizar		im at my end on this, been trouble shooting this for several days now
2008-08-30T04:05:00.000Z	quaizar		webcam mic and plugin mic neither working
2008-08-30T04:06:00.000Z	quaizar		got some distored sound through wine ventrilo with mic but can't seem to figure this out
2008-08-30T04:06:00.000Z	dres	quaizar	you've run alsamixergui and made sure the mic is turned on?  (or something else)
2008-08-30T04:07:00.000Z	quaizar	dres	function snd_ctl_open failed for default: no such device... i assume because i have to use oss 4.1 for creative xfi
2008-08-30T04:08:00.000Z	dres	quaizar	ah.  sorry not familiar with the xfi
2008-08-30T04:08:00.000Z	quaizar	dres	think it has more to do with oss than the card its self
2008-08-30T04:08:00.000Z	quaizar	dres	what about webcam mics any experience with those?
2008-08-30T04:09:00.000Z	dres	quaizar	a bit.  had to install uvc tools/kernel modules for mine.
2008-08-30T04:10:00.000Z	quaizar	dres	uvc?
2008-08-30T04:10:00.000Z	dres	quaizar	drivers for a type of webcam.
2008-08-30T04:11:00.000Z	dres	quaizar	did you get the beta drivers from creative's site for the xfi?
2008-08-30T04:11:00.000Z	quaizar	dres	installed both the oss 4.1 and the beta drivers
2008-08-30T04:14:00.000Z	quaizar	dres	Daisuke_Ido: also when i go to sound settings it shows oss for sound capture but not the camera/mic nor the xfi, don't know if there is a way to point it to them?
2008-08-30T04:16:00.000Z	dres	quaizar	sorry.  don't know.
2008-08-30T04:26:00.000Z	quaizar	dres	do you know if items that are listed in blacklist mean they are turned off? because snd_usb_audio is in there
2008-08-30T04:27:00.000Z	dres	quaizar	i believe so.
2008-08-30T04:27:00.000Z	quaizar	dres	well lets remove it and see what happens :D
