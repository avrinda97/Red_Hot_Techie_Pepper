2008-12-12T08:46:00.000Z	stovicek	kristian_	I've always used the full location, not the shortcut. IE: /home/username/directory/ instead of ~/directory/
2008-12-12T08:46:00.000Z	kristian_	stovicek	: i will give it a shot. :)
2008-12-12T08:50:00.000Z	kristian_	stovicek	: can you copy the exact from rtorrent.rc for me please. i can't it to work still by using long path.
2008-12-12T08:51:00.000Z	stovicek	kristian_	this is mine http://pastebin.com/m9a50abf
2008-12-12T08:52:00.000Z	kristian_	stovicek	: thanks very much! now i will try to figure out this once and for all. :-P
2008-12-12T08:55:00.000Z	stovicek	kristian_	you may have to make that directory location if you haven't already. rtorrent may not create it on its own.
2008-12-12T08:57:00.000Z	kristian_	stovicek	: yeah, tried first without creating dir and then it didnt work, so i tried again after mkdir, but still it doesnt want to do it! aaaaaaaaaaa! :-P
2008-12-12T08:59:00.000Z	kristian_	stovicek	: the only things i have edited in rtorrent.rc is: "download_rate = 100", "upload_rate = 30" and "directory = /home/kristian/torrent/" and the rtorrent.rc is located /home/kristian/rtorrent.rc
2008-12-12T09:00:00.000Z	stovicek	kristian_	rtorrent can be touchy. sometimes it helps to restart the app or remove and reload .torrent files in order to get things to work right.
2008-12-12T09:01:00.000Z	kristian_	stovicek	: have tried, but will try again. :)
2008-12-12T09:05:00.000Z	kristian_	stovicek	: tried and not working! :( this is what i have done: "sudo apt-get install rtorrent", "cp /usr/share/doc/rtorrent/examples/rtorrent.rc ~/" and edited with settings i said above and run rtorrent, added torrent by backspace, and it will download to /home/username and not where i set.
2008-12-12T09:07:00.000Z	stovicek	kristian_	just a wild guess, do you have ownership of the rtorrent.rc file?
2008-12-12T09:08:00.000Z	kristian_	stovicek	: im not quite sure what you mean by "ownership"?
2008-12-12T09:10:00.000Z	stovicek	kristian_	I'm wondering if your rtorrent.rc is named correctly or that you have ownership of it. It should be named .rtorrent.rc with the leading period to make it "hidden".
2008-12-12T09:12:00.000Z	kristian_	stovicek	: umm! will have a look.
2008-12-12T09:13:00.000Z	kristian_	stovicek	: that might be it! there is no leading .! brb!
2008-12-12T09:22:00.000Z	kristian_	stovicek	: thank you!!! :) i copyed the file, when i should have copied the example file and renamed it with a "." infront.
2008-12-12T09:23:00.000Z	stovicek	kristian_	excellent.... glad I could help. everything's working as expected, then?
2008-12-12T09:24:00.000Z	kristian_	stovicek	: well, yes, i've only set three options, so far, but guess i can start configuring it a bit more. :)
2008-12-12T09:26:00.000Z	kristian_	stovicek	: don't now much about what to set as maximum and minimum peers, guess ill google a bit. anyways, its downloading to correct dir and dl/ul max speeds are set, so i should be fine for some time. :) thanks again.
2008-12-12T09:27:00.000Z	stovicek	kristian_	great! that's a start in the right direction at least.
