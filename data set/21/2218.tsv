2009-12-09T21:04:00.000Z	dtownhero	unesco	sudo apt-get remove kubuntu-desktop
2009-12-09T21:07:00.000Z	unesco	dtownhero	: i don't want to lose kde desktop but i want to remove some apps from kde, it's not about free space but i just don't like when my desktop fill with many of same apps. but when i remove, dragon player i get error msg  a core application in Ubuntu. Uninstalling it may cause future upgrades to be incomplete.
2009-12-09T21:07:00.000Z	dtownhero	unesco	yes, remove kubuntu desktop then follow IceReaper's suggestion.
2009-12-09T21:14:00.000Z	unesco	dtownhero	: but removing kubuntu desktop will also remove kde.and i don't want to. i just want to remove some apps and keep some apps.
2009-12-09T21:19:00.000Z	dtownhero	unesco	sorry, i'm at work. I help when I can. If you bare with me I can help in a second.
2009-12-09T21:20:00.000Z	unesco	dtownhero	: it's ok. take your time. i'm also at work.
2009-12-09T21:38:00.000Z	dtownhero	unesco	you still there?
2009-12-09T21:38:00.000Z	unesco	dtownhero	yeah
2009-12-09T21:43:00.000Z	unesco	dtownhero	ok. i am installing kubuntu-desktop on ubuntu, and now i have a lot of same applications install, and i just don't like it. so i try to remove some applications like konqueror, ktorrent, kopete, dragon player and much more. but when i use software center to remove it i get error msg "... is a core application in Ubuntu. Uninstalling it may cause future upgrades to be incomplete "
2009-12-09T21:50:00.000Z	dtownhero	unesco	like I said earlier, use sudo uninstall kubuntu-desktop, this will remove those apps. If you decide to add KDE again you can do it with sudo apt-get install kde4
2009-12-09T21:51:00.000Z	unesco	dtownhero	: ok
2009-12-09T22:05:00.000Z	unesco	dtownhero	: what about !puregnome ? is it the only way?
2009-12-09T22:01:00.000Z	unesco	dtownhero	: sorry but sudo apt-get remove kubuntu-desktop did not remove kubuntu applications
2009-12-09T22:02:00.000Z	dtownhero	unesco	yes, we were discussing that while you were gone
2009-12-09T22:02:00.000Z	dtownhero	unesco	another thing you can do is use synaptic and search for installed apps with a K in the description
2009-12-09T22:03:00.000Z	dtownhero	unesco	even just installing K3B for burning installs some kde apps :(
2009-12-09T22:06:00.000Z	dtownhero	unesco	I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with that command.
2009-12-09T22:07:00.000Z	dtownhero	unesco	Rajasun is correct, If it were me I'd start with a fresh install and avoid that kubuntu-desktop package.
2009-12-09T22:10:00.000Z	dtownhero	unesco	I've been in your shoes and I know the frustration. I'm sorry. =(
2009-12-09T22:11:00.000Z	unesco	dtownhero	: it's ok, i think i'll go with fresh install to remove kubuntu-desktop.
2009-12-09T22:23:00.000Z	unesco	dtownhero	: the solution is here http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/puregnome :)
