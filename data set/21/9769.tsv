2005-08-27T10:02:00.000Z	vitriol		i'm getting half the transfer rate i should be getting with my hard drive :(
2005-08-27T10:03:00.000Z	vitriol		16MB/s and i *know* this drive can do 33MB/s
2005-08-27T10:03:00.000Z	vitriol		i don't know if it has to do with immature chipset support in the kernel or what
2005-08-27T10:03:00.000Z	vitriol		it's an ati chipset
2005-08-27T10:03:00.000Z	vitriol		and that's on the 2.6.11 kernel
2005-08-27T10:03:00.000Z	vitriol		2.6.10 gives me .5MB/s with hdparm
2005-08-27T10:04:00.000Z	vitriol		takes about 8 minutes to boot up :)
2005-08-27T10:04:00.000Z	brenner	vitriol	DMA setting perhaps?
2005-08-27T10:04:00.000Z	vitriol	brenner	no, DMA is on
2005-08-27T10:04:00.000Z	vitriol	brenner	unless you are saying maybe dma needs to be fine tuned?
2005-08-27T10:05:00.000Z	brenner	vitriol	no, meant enabling. :)
2005-08-27T10:05:00.000Z	vitriol	brenner	nah it's enabled
2005-08-27T10:05:00.000Z	vitriol	brenner	if i try to enable it when using the 2.6.10 kernel the command to enable dma doesn't work
2005-08-27T10:06:00.000Z	brenner	vitriol	what's the error?
2005-08-27T10:06:00.000Z	vitriol	brenner	i'd have to boot back into 2.6.10 to see
2005-08-27T10:06:00.000Z	brenner	vitriol	er, nvm
2005-08-27T10:06:00.000Z	brenner	vitriol	386 or 686 kernel?
2005-08-27T10:07:00.000Z	brenner	vitriol	i heard of someone having hjis 2gb only recognised as 700 using the 386
2005-08-27T10:07:00.000Z	vitriol	brenner	686
2005-08-27T10:09:00.000Z	brenner	vitriol	dunno, can't really think of anything else sorry
2005-10-06T09:29:00.000Z	brenner	vitriol	freezing usually indicates a display driver issue
