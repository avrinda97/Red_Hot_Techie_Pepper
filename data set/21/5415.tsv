2008-06-13T04:19:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n		hey i have a strange problem.. i've found a few threads on it.. but not what i need... i can only sometimes have multiple sounds running.. like rythmbox and vlc will play.. but if rythmbox is open and anything is on pause... sounds will not play in a browser.. nor will my im sounds come thru
2008-06-13T04:20:00.000Z	Fingel	jayde_drag0n	install libflashsupport and see if it works then
2008-06-13T04:22:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	Fingel	installing now will check.. but how will that solve im sounds not playing?
2008-06-13T04:23:00.000Z	Fingel	jayde_drag0n	by default installation flash kills pulseaudio server
2008-06-13T04:26:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	Fingel	i now have sound in firefox.. but still no sound with pidgin
2008-06-13T04:30:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	Fingel	okay mabye its lying.. i opened the preferences of pidgin.. and went to sounds.. and hit test.. i can hear all the sounds.. but its not actually DOING it
2008-06-13T04:30:00.000Z	Fingel	jayde_drag0n	what do you mean? you hear the shounds but they dont play when they are supposed to ?
2008-06-13T04:31:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	Fingel	yes exactly
2008-06-13T04:31:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	Fingel	they don't play at all during the convo
2008-06-13T04:32:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	Fingel	oh and i'm on hardy
2008-06-13T04:32:00.000Z	Fingel	jayde_drag0n	dunno man sounds like a prob with pidgin
2008-06-13T04:33:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	Fingel	but i went into preferences >sound.. and hit test on all of them.. and i hear sounds... and they DO play if rythmbox is closed
2008-06-13T04:33:00.000Z	Fingel	jayde_drag0n	one sec
2008-06-13T04:33:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	Fingel	but i want to make it so that i don't have to close rythmbox... i listen to audiobooks.. and rythmbox doesn't save my place.. so i like to leave it open and on pause so i don't lose my spot
2008-06-13T04:34:00.000Z	Fingel	jayde_drag0n	its a common problem
2008-06-13T04:34:00.000Z	Fingel	jayde_drag0n	with pulseaudio and esd
2008-06-13T04:35:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	Fingel	well i thank you very much for helping me.. you already got it so that my browser will work.. now i just need my im sounds to work.. cuz i don't notice my friends talking to me when i don't hear the ding

2008-06-13T04:37:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	Fingel	um... i don't understand what i'm reading in that link
2008-06-13T04:44:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	Fingel	okay now its just bizarre and lying to me
2008-06-13T04:45:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	Fingel	i can goto the nicserv window and type stuff.. and it maks sound JUST fine.. but my conversation window.... nothing
