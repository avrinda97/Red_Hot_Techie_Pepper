2008-06-04T02:42:00.000Z	JarG0n		What is the green text in the terminal?
2008-06-04T02:43:00.000Z	JarG0n		when I list a directory in the terminal, I have a green entry.  It's not a command, nor a directory.
2008-06-04T02:43:00.000Z	insomninja	JarG0n	an exerunable?
2008-06-04T02:43:00.000Z	JarG0n		insomninja> I'm not sure what it is.  How to I run it?
2008-06-04T02:44:00.000Z	insomninja		./filename or /absolute/path/filename
2008-06-04T02:44:00.000Z	JarG0n		insomninja> -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 5132 2008-01-23 16:05 cisco-decrypt
2008-06-04T02:44:00.000Z	JarG0n		Slart> /usr/lib/vpnc/cisco-decrypt
2008-06-04T02:44:00.000Z	JarG0n		Slart> How do I exec it?
2008-06-04T02:45:00.000Z	insomninja		/usr/lib/vpnc/cisco-decrypt or cd /usr/lib/vpnc/; ./cisco-decrypt
2008-06-04T02:45:00.000Z	JarG0n		Slart> bash: cisco-decrypt: command not found
2008-06-04T02:45:00.000Z	JarG0n		oh, I have to type the path entirely?
2008-06-04T02:45:00.000Z	JarG0n		Slart> What does that do ?
2008-06-04T02:46:00.000Z	JarG0n		Slart> Why doesn't it work if I just type the command?
2008-06-04T02:46:00.000Z	JarG0n		Slart> ok, thx for your assistance :)
2008-06-04T02:47:00.000Z	insomninja	JarG0n	only files residing in directories in your path environment variable can get executed without the full path I think
2008-06-04T02:47:00.000Z	JarG0n	insomninja	Slart: then what does ./ represent ?
2008-06-04T02:47:00.000Z	insomninja		. is the current directory
2008-06-04T02:47:00.000Z	insomninja		.. is parent
2008-06-04T02:48:00.000Z	JarG0n		Slart> Yeah, I remember now.  I did read about that.  It's a virus preventative too I think.
2008-06-04T02:53:00.000Z	JarG0n		Slart> insomninja>  thanks for your help.  I got what I needed, and that fixed my problem! :)
2008-06-04T02:53:00.000Z	insomninja	JarG0n	no problem
