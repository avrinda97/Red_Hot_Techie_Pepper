2012-01-08T15:09:00.000Z	wildc4rd		running a ubuntu desktop box as a media player, what is the best/easiest way to change tracks, play/pause etc at a distance?
2012-01-08T15:10:00.000Z	[deXter]	wildc4rd	do you have a smartphone?
2012-01-08T15:10:00.000Z	wildc4rd	[deXter]	yes
2012-01-08T15:11:00.000Z	[deXter]	wildc4rd	then there are many remote media player control apps.. on the android for eg, there's a VLC remote app you can use
2012-01-08T15:11:00.000Z	[deXter]		to control VLC player
2012-01-08T15:11:00.000Z	wildc4rd	[deXter]	really? I'll have a look!
2012-01-08T15:12:00.000Z	[deXter]		welcome back, FloodBot1 :)
2012-01-08T15:17:00.000Z	wildc4rd	[deXter]	got the app installed (and I'm already running VLC) do I need to make any changes PC side as it refuses connection currently
2012-01-08T15:20:00.000Z	[deXter]	wildc4rd	yes you must star the HTTP server in VLC
2012-01-08T15:20:00.000Z	[deXter]	wildc4rd	vlc --extraintf=luahttp --fullscreen --http-album-art --qt-start-minimized
2012-01-08T15:21:00.000Z	[deXter]	wildc4rd	Also, check http://code.google.com/p/android-vlc-remote/wiki/Troubleshooting
2012-01-08T15:37:00.000Z	wildc4rd	[deXter]	got a few problems here, are you happy to go through them (could be time consuming, lol)
2012-01-08T15:38:00.000Z	[deXter]	wildc4rd	sure
2012-01-08T15:40:00.000Z	wildc4rd	[deXter]	OK, I get a connection error from the phone app, and several errors when using that command in terminal, where would you like to start? lol
2012-01-08T15:43:00.000Z	wildc4rd	[deXter]	have pm'd you the pastebin from terminal
2012-01-08T15:44:00.000Z	[deXter]	wildc4rd	ah those vlc errors are nothing to worry about they're just warnings, it's normal
2012-01-08T15:44:00.000Z	[deXter]		what's the connection error on the phone app?
2012-01-08T15:44:00.000Z	wildc4rd		hang on
2012-01-08T15:46:00.000Z	wildc4rd	[deXter]	java.net.ConnectException: /192.168.1.101:8080 - Connection Refused
2012-01-08T15:48:00.000Z	[deXter]		Hmm, wildc4rd that sounds like a firewall is blocking it
2012-01-08T15:48:00.000Z	[deXter]	wildc4rd	try disabling your firewall
