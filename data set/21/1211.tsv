2010-12-25T04:53:00.000Z	Maahes	boa`	you don't.
2010-12-25T04:54:00.000Z	Maahes	boa`	run that script again with sudo in front of it, and paste the output into pastebin
2010-12-25T04:55:00.000Z	Maahes	boa`	what do you get from the following command: which adb
2010-12-25T04:56:00.000Z	Maahes	boa`	echo $PATH
2010-12-25T04:57:00.000Z	Maahes	boa`	and adb was made executable?
2010-12-25T04:58:00.000Z	Maahes	boa`	you need to make it executable
2010-12-25T04:58:00.000Z	Maahes	boa`	chmod a+x adb
2010-12-25T05:00:00.000Z	Maahes	boa`	that shouldn't be necessary
2010-12-25T05:01:00.000Z	Maahes	boa`	that's the issue
2010-12-25T05:03:00.000Z	boa`	Maahes	i dunno what to do
2010-12-25T05:04:00.000Z	Maahes	boa`	try removing all the packages installed by the zip and reinstalling it.
2010-12-25T05:07:00.000Z	Maahes	boa`	I hope you did the extraction as your normal user and not root
2010-12-25T05:07:00.000Z	Maahes	boa`	ok.
2010-12-25T05:09:00.000Z	Maahes	boa`	and sudo adb devices?
2010-12-25T05:09:00.000Z	Maahes	boa`	try this sudo /path/to/adb
2010-12-25T05:09:00.000Z	Maahes	boa`	try it anyways
2010-12-25T05:11:00.000Z	Maahes	boa`	go to users and groups in the menu, and take a look at what your user permissions are.
2010-12-25T05:19:00.000Z	Maahes	boa`	the only thing I know similar to that command is chroot
2010-12-25T05:20:00.000Z	Maahes	boa`	I think that's a typo and meant to be chroot
