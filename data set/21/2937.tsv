2009-05-10T19:54:00.000Z	Bakagringo	jrib	> ok, I'll remember that till next time. The pastebin was for you
2009-05-10T19:55:00.000Z	jrib	Bakagringo	what arch?
2009-05-10T19:56:00.000Z	Bakagringo	jrib	> arch?
2009-05-10T19:56:00.000Z	jrib	Bakagringo	architecture?
2009-05-10T19:56:00.000Z	Bakagringo		64
2009-05-10T19:56:00.000Z	Bakagringo		jrib> 64-bit
2009-05-10T19:56:00.000Z	jrib	Bakagringo	and I'm guessing sc_serv is not 32bit...?
2009-05-10T19:57:00.000Z	Bakagringo	jrib	> most probably it is. Any backwards compatibility?
2009-05-10T19:57:00.000Z	jrib	Bakagringo	install the ia32-libs package and try again
2009-05-10T19:57:00.000Z	Bakagringo	jrib	> ok, I will try that, thank you.
