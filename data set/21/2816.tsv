2010-05-12T17:27:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	AceKing	ls -l /var/run/network/ifstate  ...what's that give you?
2010-05-12T17:31:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	AceKing	roger. i'm not sure what's wrong. root should be able to read and write to that file. mies is like so.... -rw------- 1 root root 16 2010-05-12 05:35 ifstate
2010-05-12T17:31:00.000Z	AceKing	onetinsoldier	how do I fix it?
2010-05-12T17:32:00.000Z	AceKing	onetinsoldier	I mean, is there a way to reinstall anything?
2010-05-12T17:33:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	AceKing	that's what i'm saying, i don't know. you can try to make the permissions for that file exactly like mine are, but i don't think that doing that will solve the problem. i'm not sure what's wrong
2010-05-12T17:33:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	AceKing	if you want to make the permissions exactly like mine, do --> sudo chmod go-w ifstate
2010-05-12T17:34:00.000Z	AceKing	onetinsoldier	thank you for at least getting me this far. I will try that. If it doesn't work, I'll just re install 10.04
2010-05-12T17:36:00.000Z	AceKing	onetinsoldier	chmod: cannot access 'ifstate': No such file or directory
2010-05-12T17:36:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	AceKing	the best thing to so is put ask the question now like this... "hello. when i run this command... ifdown eth0, i get the following error --> failed to open statefile /var/run/network/ifstate: Permission denied
2010-05-12T17:37:00.000Z	AceKing	onetinsoldier	thank you, I will do that!
2010-05-12T17:37:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	AceKing	try --> sudo chmod go-w /var/run/network/ifstate
2010-05-12T17:37:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	AceKing	ok, good luck!
2010-05-12T17:39:00.000Z	AceKing	onetinsoldier	ok, I tried the last command you gave me. It came back to the prompt with no errors. I will restart the laptop and see what happens
2010-05-12T17:40:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	AceKing	well, like i said, my suggestion is not likely to solve the problem
2010-05-12T17:40:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	AceKing	try what joaopinto said
2010-05-12T17:41:00.000Z	AceKing	onetinsoldier	that's ok, I appreciate the help. I will try what joaopinto said before I restart
2010-05-12T17:42:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	AceKing	sounds good. just figure you need the 'sudo' command for pretty much everyting you'll be trying right now, pretty much. if you want a root prompt, do --> sudo -i
2010-05-12T17:52:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	AceKing	i'm glad you got it worked out :-)
2010-05-12T17:52:00.000Z	AceKing	onetinsoldier	thank you for your help.
2010-05-12T17:52:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	AceKing	better that reinstalling 10.04 wasn't it? hehe, you're welcome, but i didn't really do anything
2010-05-12T17:53:00.000Z	AceKing	onetinsoldier	you're not kidding!
