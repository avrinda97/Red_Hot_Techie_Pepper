2005-07-27T07:09:00.000Z	Ginsu	bob2	Sorry... Gnome panels.  Are they stored someplace that can be linked?
2005-07-27T07:02:00.000Z	bob2	Ginsu	you can't
2005-07-27T07:02:00.000Z	bob2	Ginsu	what are you trying to do?
2005-07-27T07:03:00.000Z	Ginsu	bob2	similar to sharing stuff like in Windows putting something in the "All Users\Desktop"
2005-07-27T07:03:00.000Z	bob2	Ginsu	what do you want to put there?
2005-07-27T07:04:00.000Z	Ginsu	bob2	I'd like to set up common icons and files for my other family members.  It makes it easier for them.
2005-07-27T07:04:00.000Z	bob2	Ginsu	you can put things in /etc/skel/, and they;ll be copied into new user's home directories
2005-07-27T07:05:00.000Z	Ginsu	bob2	But I understand that only works for new user IDs.  I don't want existing family members have to create icons.
2005-07-27T07:06:00.000Z	bob2	Ginsu	then you'll have to copy them, sorry
2005-07-27T07:06:00.000Z	bob2	Ginsu	or symlink thewir ~/Desktop to somewhere central
2005-07-27T07:06:00.000Z	Ginsu	bob2	link to a common desktop would work.
2005-07-27T07:07:00.000Z	Ginsu	bob2	Can a single nautilus panel be linked to a common area?
2005-07-27T07:07:00.000Z	bob2	Ginsu	I don't know hat a nautilus panel is
2005-07-27T07:08:00.000Z	Ginsu	bob2	panels are the borders in ubuntu that hold the icons and menu.  I may have got the terms wrong.
2005-07-27T07:08:00.000Z	bob2	Ginsu	it's nothing to do with nautilus
2005-07-27T07:09:00.000Z	bob2	Ginsu	no, I can't think how you would share the panel settings
2005-07-27T07:10:00.000Z	bob2	Ginsu	not simply, gconf looks after it.  what's the advantage of forcing everyone to share a panel config, but not a home directory?
2005-07-27T07:11:00.000Z	Ginsu	bob2	 Basically, I can magically put an icon on everyone's desktop without them have to create one themselves.
2005-07-27T07:12:00.000Z	bob2	Ginsu	that's not to do with the panel.  just make everyone's ~/Desktop a symlink to /var/tmp/Desktop/ or such and put things in there
2005-07-27T07:12:00.000Z	Ginsu	bob2	 Thanks.  I give it try.
