2011-11-26T07:05:00.000Z	nvz		ew broadcom.. heh.. those bc43xx hybrid radios are the worst of em all.. heh.
2011-11-26T07:06:00.000Z	dewcow	nvz	right? thats why i was AMAZED when it worked almost straight out of install
2011-11-26T07:07:00.000Z	nvz	dewcow	support has improved in the last few months for that.. but they're still aweful. heh glad my dying netbook here has atheros.. heh
2011-11-26T07:08:00.000Z	dewcow	nvz	mmm atheros.
2011-11-26T07:08:00.000Z	nvz	dewcow	wireless hackers delight.. heh
2011-11-26T07:10:00.000Z	dewcow	nvz	i remember going through many 'cheap' cards at the store until i found some with atheros chipsets.
2011-11-26T07:10:00.000Z	dewcow	nvz	always wished i could have had an orinoco gold
2011-11-26T07:12:00.000Z	nvz	dewcow	I had the HawkingTechnology HWU8110UG I think it was.. 3-4inch satellite dish, usb.. had an Atheros AR5007 if I recall correctly.. it was great.. that company makes some decent cheap stuff, worth checking out their website
2011-11-26T07:13:00.000Z	nvz	dewcow	only cost me about $60 and best buy several years ago and worked great on linux.. just required the zydas firmware zd1211 package
2011-11-26T07:14:00.000Z	dewcow	nvz	thanks for the info. i might just have to look around
2011-11-26T07:14:00.000Z	nvz	dewcow	the range on that thing was insane.. I could hit all 3 APs at the WVU colleseum from almost 2mi away across the river
2011-11-26T07:14:00.000Z	nvz	dewcow	only downside to those kinda things is that you generally need to be within 30deg or so of right angle and have a clear line of sight for max distance
2011-11-26T07:15:00.000Z	dewcow	nvz	christ thats impressive for a pre-built card
2011-11-26T07:15:00.000Z	nvz	dewcow	had +8dbi gain and was extremely portable and convenient
2011-11-26T07:16:00.000Z	dewcow	nvz	a buddy and i used to build cantennas that had suprisingly good results. but also had a very narrow angle of range
2011-11-26T07:16:00.000Z	dewcow	nvz	was that a usb card? or pcmcia?
2011-11-26T07:18:00.000Z	nvz	dewcow	it was a USB dish.. was about 3inches diameter and rotated 180deg and tilted up and down about 45deg was really nice for US$60 price range site is hawkingtechnology.com they have newer better ones out now..
2011-11-26T07:19:00.000Z	dewcow	nvz	question is if they support blackfriday right now. wouldn't that be nice.
2011-11-26T07:19:00.000Z	dewcow	nvz	ha, now if only i could call it an early christmas present to the girlfriend i could justify it.
2011-11-26T07:25:00.000Z	dewcow	nvz	you think they still put atheros in them?
2011-11-26T07:33:00.000Z	nvz	dewcow	well the one that replaced the HWU8DD I had, is the HWU9DD and it is said to have a RTL8188SU, the do have another model though and you can still find the HWU8DD which is technically a Zydas ZD1211RW chipset, but its essentially just a modified Atheros 5007UG and the firmware is available in the zd1211rw-firmware package for linux
