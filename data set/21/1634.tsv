2010-08-07T17:08:00.000Z	Kruptein		hey why is the 'side-by-side' install option gone?
2010-08-07T17:09:00.000Z	Kruptein		I get only the option to use the entire disk or to specify manually...
2010-08-07T17:11:00.000Z	Kruptein		nobody knows where the 'side by side' install option is?
2010-08-07T17:11:00.000Z	DGM	Kruptein	its in there near the bottom.. look better :)
2010-08-07T17:11:00.000Z	DGM	Kruptein	use largest free space
2010-08-07T17:12:00.000Z	DGM	Kruptein	ofcourse you would have to resize your partitions beforehand to make the space
2010-08-07T17:12:00.000Z	Kruptein	DGM	 I have only 2 options:  entire disk  or manually select partitions
2010-08-07T17:12:00.000Z	DGM	Kruptein	is your other OS windows?
2010-08-07T17:13:00.000Z	Kruptein	DGM	Okay I will try that first thanks
2010-08-07T17:19:00.000Z	Kruptein	DGM	where can I find those administrator tools?
2010-08-07T17:20:00.000Z	DGM	Kruptein	rightclick the start menu, properties. You should be able to show administator tools in the start menu there somewhere. From there its computer management
2010-08-07T17:22:00.000Z	Kruptein	DGM	Okay found it thanks
2010-08-07T17:39:00.000Z	Kruptein	DGM	 I made the windows partitions smaller and rebooted into the ubuntu live cd, now the empty space is declared as "not usable",  Should I format it first?
2010-08-07T17:39:00.000Z	DGM	Kruptein	is it too small maybe? whats the size of the free space. And by free space i mean unpartitioned. Not a new paritition created inside windows mind
2010-08-07T17:40:00.000Z	DGM	Kruptein	but is that space partitioned or not?
2010-08-07T17:40:00.000Z	Kruptein	DGM	unpartitioned
2010-08-07T17:41:00.000Z	DGM	Kruptein	then it should be able to use it just fine. If you want to use them togetter you will have to do it manually though. I'd use the 39gb for / and the 93 gb for /home/
2010-08-07T17:43:00.000Z	Kruptein	DGM	I really don't understand it,  in the "select partitions manually"  the 2 free spaces are displayed as unusable,  how the hell can I say that ubuntu has to use those?
2010-08-07T17:44:00.000Z	DGM	Kruptein	if they're unusable they are probably partitioned.. i think. You will have to go into the partition tool manually and lay them all out
2010-08-07T17:45:00.000Z	Kruptein	DGM	is there any partition tool in the basic installation?
2010-08-07T17:45:00.000Z	DGM	Kruptein	whats the paritions and types it shows here? http://www.serenux.com/~hyrax/snaps/UbuntuJauntyManuallyPartition2.png for you?
