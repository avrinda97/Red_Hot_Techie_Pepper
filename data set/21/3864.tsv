2009-04-19T12:50:00.000Z	stevr1it	dotblank	y4es i did and it does not work with that dirver
2009-04-19T12:53:00.000Z	dotblank	stevr1it	in synaptic it should be under Package -> force version
2009-04-19T12:55:00.000Z	stevr1it	dotblank	thre is no force version in synaptic
2009-04-19T12:57:00.000Z	dotblank	stevr1it	try http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/foomatic-db-engine
2009-04-19T13:05:00.000Z	dotblank	stevr1it	Im sorry, Im out of ideas perhaps try using 8.04 or use 9.04
2009-04-19T13:05:00.000Z	stevr1it	dotblank	i have tried that foomatic-db-engine but when i try to install with gdebi it says that this is too old and it cannot install it
2009-04-19T13:06:00.000Z	dotblank	stevr1it	try uninstalling the current one
2009-04-19T13:08:00.000Z	stevr1it	dotblank	in synaptinc there aret o many foomatic driver, should i uninstall only the db-engine?
2009-04-19T13:08:00.000Z	dotblank	stevr1it	I guess but if it suggests removing alot of other packages, don't
2009-04-19T13:14:00.000Z	dotblank	stevr1it	ugh, have you tried 9.04?
2009-04-19T13:15:00.000Z	dotblank	stevr1it	hmm check the groups your user is a member of
2009-04-19T13:15:00.000Z	stevr1it	dotblank	what do you mean? I don't understand
2009-04-19T13:16:00.000Z	dotblank	stevr1it	in ubuntu alot of access controls are handled by groups so by modifying what groups you are a member can change your permissions
2009-04-19T13:19:00.000Z	stevr1it	dotblank	clear but i am into the user and group, my nick is stevr1it and i don't know what should i change
2009-04-19T13:19:00.000Z	stevr1it	dotblank	and moreover, why i can print small documents, and not big with my printer? it has 1.5gb ram installed
2009-04-19T13:23:00.000Z	stevr1it	dotblank	 my login profile user is connected with the same name group
