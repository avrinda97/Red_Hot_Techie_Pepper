2009-11-26T22:24:00.000Z	roy_1		Hi! How can I change the login sounds in karmic?
2009-11-26T22:24:00.000Z	ibuclaw	roy_1	initial login? with some difficulty. ;)
2009-11-26T22:25:00.000Z	roy_1	ibuclaw	How?
2009-11-26T22:26:00.000Z	ibuclaw	roy_1	haven't had a chance to test it yet. But for the sound as you are "Logging Into" your account, you go into Sound Properties.
2009-11-26T22:27:00.000Z	ibuclaw	roy_1	for the Initial screen, it is the same process, but you load the sound properties in a slightly different way.
2009-11-26T22:27:00.000Z	roy_1	ibuclaw	There's no such property available on the login screen.
2009-11-26T22:28:00.000Z	ibuclaw	roy_1	hence why I said "with some difficulty" ;)
2009-11-26T22:29:00.000Z	roy_1		But in earlier versions it was easily configurable from the "desktop "login preferences".
2009-11-26T22:29:00.000Z	ibuclaw	roy_1	gdm 2.24 and later versions have been a complete rewrite
2009-11-26T22:30:00.000Z	roy_1	ibuclaw	 yep, not very pleasant update :(
2009-11-26T22:30:00.000Z	ibuclaw	roy_1	it is still configurable, just not quite as easy as it had been prior. Then again, as far as gnome devs are concerned, no one / not enough people have complained earlier.
2009-11-26T22:31:00.000Z	ibuclaw		so they just presume that it is all OK... that is not to say that a more advance configuration screen won't be made at a later date.
2009-11-26T22:32:00.000Z	roy_1		From grub2 to login/sounds etc... it's all very very messy. It's really not very usable out-of-the-box.
2009-11-26T22:35:00.000Z	ibuclaw	roy_1	this is how you would do so. http://paste.ubuntu.com/328644/plain/
2009-11-26T22:35:00.000Z	ibuclaw	roy_1	that would start a sound applet at login ;)
2009-11-26T22:35:00.000Z	ibuclaw		from there you should be able to configure startup sound.
2009-11-26T22:35:00.000Z	ibuclaw		at least. I "presume"
2009-11-26T22:36:00.000Z	roy_1	ibuclaw	Thanks :)
2009-11-26T22:37:00.000Z	ibuclaw	roy_1	I wrote a guide here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1333683
2009-11-26T22:37:00.000Z	ibuclaw	roy_1	it's not as complete as I'd like it yet though ;)
2009-11-26T22:38:00.000Z	roy_1	ibuclaw	 Wow. That's awesome! I"ll print those right away :D
