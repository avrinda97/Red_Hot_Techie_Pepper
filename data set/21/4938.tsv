2009-01-04T05:58:00.000Z	seth		I have a hardware question for Ubuntu 8.10
2009-01-04T05:58:00.000Z	seth		ok thanks
2009-01-04T05:59:00.000Z	seth		I have Ubuntu 8.10 on a Dell Inspiron 1501 and as soon as I installed Ubuntu over Windows my CD Drive stopped working, any ideas?
2009-01-04T06:01:00.000Z	seth		I cannot boot to anything the door does upon it just will not boot anything
2009-01-04T06:02:00.000Z	seth		the door does open nothing loads
2009-01-04T06:04:00.000Z	seth		It seems to me like the cd reader isn't moving
2009-01-04T06:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	seth	its hardware then
2009-01-04T06:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	seth	does it boot the live cd ok
2009-01-04T06:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	seth	what does: file /dev/scd0
2009-01-04T06:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	seth	grab a paperclip or similar and you should have a small hole on it, stab in there and it will open
2009-01-04T06:05:00.000Z	seth	ActionParsnip	why would it happen now though?
2009-01-04T06:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	seth	what model system is it, maybe theres a tweak you need
2009-01-04T06:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	seth	http://www.ubuntu1501.com/
2009-01-04T06:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	seth	no fooling
2009-01-04T06:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	seth	if you get your whole system updated it may help
2009-01-04T06:15:00.000Z	seth	ActionParsnip	I upgraded from 8.04 to 8.10 that's when it messed up on me
2009-01-04T06:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	seth	not sure then, maybe the new kernel doesnt like your cd drive. are you on the intrepid kernel (run uname -a and give us the output)
2009-01-04T06:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	seth	yeah thats intrepid
2009-01-04T06:18:00.000Z	seth	ActionParsnip	Is there anyway of undoing the upgrade?
2009-01-04T06:32:00.000Z	seth	ActionParsnip	can you help me? I am at your mercy..lol
2009-01-04T06:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	seth	you could roll back to the hardy kernel
