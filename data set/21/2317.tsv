2009-11-08T17:37:00.000Z	Munim	aruna	what laptop do you use?
2009-11-08T17:38:00.000Z	Munim	aruna	the model of the laptop. HP uses many different adapters in different models
2009-11-08T17:41:00.000Z	Munim	aruna	you have a Broadcom wifi adapter
2009-11-08T17:43:00.000Z	Munim	aruna	can you see the available wifi networks?
2009-11-08T17:44:00.000Z	aruna	Munim	in network connection i see only Wireless network disabled
2009-11-08T17:44:00.000Z	Munim	aruna	if your wifi button is switched on, i guess you need some other wifi drivers
2009-11-08T17:45:00.000Z	aruna	Munim	in hardware device i have 2 devices ... Broadcom B43 and STA
2009-11-08T17:47:00.000Z	aruna	Munim	do i need to install any other ?
2009-11-08T17:47:00.000Z	Munim	aruna	i am not sure if this will help you.. but you can try this: http://jetpackweb.com/blog/2009/10/29/ubuntu-9-10-karmic-koala-and-broadcom-bcm4312/
2009-11-08T17:47:00.000Z	Munim	aruna	i don't know the solution any more.. but i am trying to look for it :)
2009-11-08T17:48:00.000Z	Munim	aruna	apparently executing "sudo apt-get install bcmwl-kernel-source
2009-11-08T17:49:00.000Z	Munim	aruna	yes i think so
2009-11-08T17:50:00.000Z	Munim	aruna	wierd.
2009-11-08T17:51:00.000Z	Munim	aruna	by the way, did you do a fresh install or upgrade from an older version of ubuntu?
2009-11-08T17:52:00.000Z	Munim	aruna	hmm okay. try asking someone else or googling for help. i'm sorry
2009-11-08T17:53:00.000Z	Munim	aruna	that's because your bluetooth adapter is working perfectly.. but you may need some other wifi drivers
2009-11-08T17:57:00.000Z	Munim	aruna	can you find your card model in this list? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HardwareSupportComponentsWirelessNetworkCardsBroadcom
2009-11-08T17:58:00.000Z	Munim	aruna	oh no.. linux OS's need different drivers.
