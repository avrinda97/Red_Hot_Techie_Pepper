2006-04-03T14:02:00.000Z	Delicates		what FS would you format a 500GB home storage drive?
2006-04-03T14:03:00.000Z	variant	Delicates	XFS is very nice
2006-04-03T14:03:00.000Z	variant	Delicates	reiserfs is also nice.. its up to you..
2006-04-03T14:04:00.000Z	variant	Delicates	format it as each and test it with lots of small files and a couple of big ones.. see what works best for you
2006-04-03T14:05:00.000Z	variant	Delicates	the fs you choose depends mostly on whether you really need that extra 0.5% performance and the size and type of files you will be useing
2006-04-03T14:05:00.000Z	variant	Delicates	in that case you can only use fat32/ntfs or ext2 (not ext3)
2006-04-03T14:06:00.000Z	Delicates	variant	ext3 is backwards compatible with ext3
2006-04-03T14:07:00.000Z	variant	Delicates	with ext2 yes but you cant mount it under windows
2006-04-03T14:07:00.000Z	Delicates	variant	you can mount it as ext2
2006-04-03T14:07:00.000Z	variant	Delicates	you can mount ext2 or ext3 if you disable the journal (back to ext2)
2006-04-03T14:08:00.000Z	variant	Delicates	you would have to disable the journal under ubuntu first which would be a bit of a pain in the as
2006-04-03T14:08:00.000Z	Delicates	variant	which IFSD driver are you talking about?
2006-04-03T14:08:00.000Z	variant	Delicates	because its not.. there is no ext3 undelete but you can use file recovery tools like magic rescue
2006-04-03T14:09:00.000Z	variant	Delicates	what is ifsd?
2006-04-03T14:09:00.000Z	Delicates	variant	Installable File System Driver for Windows
2006-04-03T14:09:00.000Z	variant	Delicates	there is one for ext2 but not anything else afaik
2006-04-03T14:10:00.000Z	variant	Delicates	you totaly just made up that acronym
2006-04-03T14:10:00.000Z	Delicates	variant	http://rfsd.sourceforge.net/
2006-04-03T14:11:00.000Z	variant	Delicates	i would not rely on that to provide you with access.. i would be suprised if it works in its current state
2006-04-03T14:12:00.000Z	Delicates	variant	I'm not planning to use it with Windows immediately... some time in the future maybe
2006-04-03T14:12:00.000Z	variant	Delicates	it would appear to be "not quite dead" as it says on the project page
