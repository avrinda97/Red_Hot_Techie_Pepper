2011-04-27T16:14:00.000Z	schnuffle	gaurav_help	locale - Get locale-specific information.
2011-04-27T16:15:00.000Z	schnuffle	gaurav_help	which means a locale sets time/date format and everything that is language specific
2011-04-27T16:15:00.000Z	schnuffle	gaurav_help	So if you want to run your prog with the locale you have set you need to install it
