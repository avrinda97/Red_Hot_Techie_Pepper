2009-09-21T15:58:00.000Z	alokito	o2o	xfce is better ofcourse, it's one of the main 3 de's
2009-09-21T16:02:00.000Z	alokito	o2o	it's a feature in most irc clients including Xchat
2009-09-21T16:03:00.000Z	o2o	alokito	but why my xchat client could not use that?
2009-09-21T16:05:00.000Z	alokito	o2o	sorry my net is slow so I'm lagging a lot... which irc client are u using? Xchat is an "irc" client there's no such thing as "Xchat client" :P
2009-09-21T16:06:00.000Z	o2o	alokito	do you mean that there is another Xchat
2009-09-21T16:06:00.000Z	alokito	o2o	check your settings, maybe the feature is turned off
2009-09-21T16:09:00.000Z	alokito	o2o	no I mean there are many irc clients(i.e.: xchat, miranda, mirc, quassel) and xchat is one of them
2009-09-21T16:09:00.000Z	alokito	o2o	I prefer the original Xchat, though im using quassel now
2009-09-21T16:10:00.000Z	alokito	o2o	yup!
2009-09-21T16:12:00.000Z	alokito	o2o	xchat gnome is the gnome version of xchat
2009-09-21T16:12:00.000Z	o2o	alokito	 :P
