2006-04-22T15:19:00.000Z	maxbax		may i ask a question, or probably more accurately, a series of silly questions?
2006-04-22T15:21:00.000Z	maxbax		thanks, i installed this "ubuntu" thingmyjig onto my pentium 3 700mhz computer which is suspect is actually impaired functionally, is there a way for me to test whether it's working as well as it can or if it's broken?
2006-04-22T15:22:00.000Z	maxbax		polbak it was running really slowly.
2006-04-22T15:22:00.000Z	maxbax		on windows, so i assumed it was full of viruses and crap so i said, this is a sign from the gods to install "linux"
2006-04-22T15:22:00.000Z	maxbax		but with ubuntu, it's sitll really slow
2006-04-22T15:22:00.000Z	maxbax		the simplist things seem to require 100% cpu
2006-04-22T15:23:00.000Z	Frogzoo	maxbax	run top for starters & see where the cpu's going
2006-04-22T15:24:00.000Z	Frogzoo	maxbax	& how much memory do you have?
2006-04-22T15:24:00.000Z	Frogzoo	maxbax	'top'
2006-04-22T15:24:00.000Z	maxbax	Frogzoo	i think i have 256
2006-04-22T15:26:00.000Z	Frogzoo	maxbax	& what does 'free' say mem/buffers (also, 700MHz is a littel on the light side)
2006-04-22T15:37:00.000Z	Frogzoo	maxbax	700MHz/256Meg is a little light, but still should be usable
2006-04-22T15:37:00.000Z	Frogzoo	maxbax	did you run top to see what was using all the cpu?
2006-04-22T15:38:00.000Z	Frogzoo	maxbax	well, what did it say? how much %cpu was the process at the top?
2006-04-22T15:39:00.000Z	maxbax	Frogzoo	every so often xorg pops to the top at 4.6%
2006-04-22T15:40:00.000Z	Frogzoo	maxbax	which is nothing, so cpu's not an issue, the next is memory, what does 'free' say?
2006-04-22T15:42:00.000Z	maxbax	Frogzoo	memory ~70000k free, swap 7489289k free.
2006-04-22T15:43:00.000Z	Frogzoo	maxbax	7gig swapfile? totally overkill & possibly a problem
2006-04-22T15:44:00.000Z	Frogzoo	maxbax	swapon -s
2006-04-22T15:47:00.000Z	Frogzoo	maxbax	I'd expect switching between desktops & opening apps to be a little sluggish, but fine otherwise
2006-04-22T15:49:00.000Z	maxbax	Frogzoo	so what would recommend? grin and bear it? downsize this ubuntu or install a "liter" version of "linux"?
