2006-01-10T10:25:00.000Z	Mabus06		I got a 1, too.
2006-01-10T10:26:00.000Z	Mabus06		doom, you mean?
2006-01-10T10:26:00.000Z	Mabus06		there is a bfg in quake?
2006-01-10T10:26:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	Mabus06	The BFG10k
2006-01-17T13:16:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	Mabus06	right click on the cd, select 'copy cd'
2006-01-17T13:17:00.000Z	Mabus06	PuMpErNiCkLe	for when you only have one drive, though..
2006-01-17T13:17:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	Mabus06	same thing
2006-01-17T13:17:00.000Z	Mabus06	PuMpErNiCkLe	no... doesn't work
2006-01-17T13:18:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	Mabus06	When the menu appears, there's a drop-down box that says "write disk to..."
2006-01-17T13:18:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	Mabus06	Click on that, and select "file".
2006-01-17T13:18:00.000Z	Mabus06	PuMpErNiCkLe	nope... says no media in selected drive before I get a chance to select anything
2006-01-17T13:19:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	Mabus06	Do you have the media in a recognized drive? ;)
2006-01-17T13:21:00.000Z	Mabus06	PuMpErNiCkLe	the to-be-isoed cd is in the drive
2006-01-17T13:21:00.000Z	Mabus06	PuMpErNiCkLe	uh, now it works for some reason, on like the fourth try... :/
2006-01-17T13:22:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	Mabus06	cool :)
2006-01-17T13:23:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	Mabus06	So long as it keeps on working - unlike mine, which failed because of a bad PSU that crashed the entire computer - it's all good. :)
2006-01-17T13:23:00.000Z	Mabus06	PuMpErNiCkLe	it's a scratched-to-hell windows xp cd that I'm trying to get on a new,  unscratched cd
2006-01-17T13:23:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	Mabus06	Good luck, then ^^
2006-01-18T13:57:00.000Z	Mabus06	PuMpErNiCkLe	wow, very nerdy ;-)
2006-01-18T13:57:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	Mabus06	Yes, thank you :)
