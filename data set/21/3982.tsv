2008-11-15T14:32:00.000Z	Omar87		I tried to install python 2.6, and something went wrong. The mouse keeps going out of control, Exail and Emesene don't start.. The update manager is acting weird. Please help me.
2008-11-15T14:33:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	Omar87	uninstall it?
2008-11-15T14:34:00.000Z	Omar87	kindofabuzz	the problem is, it doesn't even appear to have been installed.
2008-11-15T14:34:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	Omar87	type python --version
2008-11-15T14:44:00.000Z	Omar87	kindofabuzz	I'm trying to get the output for "python --version", but it takes some time get it. Now, if press ctrl-c during that and try "python --version" again it does give me the completely output instantly, but then it takes the mouse away from me, in a way that my clicks are no more effective, I can no longer do anything at all but moving the cursor or hitting ctrl-alt-back space on the keyboard.
2008-11-15T14:45:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	Omar87	open up Synaptic and search for python, if you see that 2.6, uninstall it
2008-11-15T14:47:00.000Z	Omar87	kindofabuzz	I tried that, moments ago. Python 2.6 doesn't even exist there.
2008-11-15T14:47:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	Omar87	don't know what to tell you really, sorry
2008-11-15T14:50:00.000Z	Omar87	kindofabuzz	I'm trying installing python-all. Maybe this might help.
2008-11-15T14:52:00.000Z	Omar87	kindofabuzz	Isn't it weird that Ubuntu supports Python 3.0, but doesn't seem to support Python 2.6?
2008-11-15T14:52:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	Omar87	yeah i noticed that when you started talking about it, i looked it up, 2.5 and 3.0 in repos but no 2.6
2008-11-15T14:53:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	Omar87	2.5 is all you need right now
2008-11-15T14:53:00.000Z	Omar87	kindofabuzz	Could it be because 3.0 is more mature?
2008-11-15T14:54:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	Omar87	not sure
2008-11-15T14:54:00.000Z	Omar87	kindofabuzz	That's true. I've learned my lesson. :)
2008-11-15T14:56:00.000Z	Omar87	kindofabuzz	For some reason, the mouse keeps going out of control. It keeps taking the shape of a plus sign ( + ).
2008-11-15T14:56:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	Omar87	that's weird, just from installing 2.6? which has nothing to do with graphics or mice
2008-11-15T14:57:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	Omar87	have you tried restrting X?
2008-11-15T14:57:00.000Z	Omar87	kindofabuzz	How do I do that?
2008-11-15T14:58:00.000Z	Omar87	kindofabuzz	I tried that many times.
2008-11-15T14:59:00.000Z	Omar87	kindofabuzz	Is there a way to regain control over it from the terminal?
