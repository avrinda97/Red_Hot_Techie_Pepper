2012-05-21T18:45:00.000Z	ikonia	stueng	not really
2012-05-22T15:20:00.000Z	ikonia	stueng	cp -R $directory /$newlocation
2012-05-22T15:21:00.000Z	stueng	ikonia	I want to copy the contents of wher eI am now (pwd)
2012-05-22T15:21:00.000Z	ikonia	stueng	cp -R .
2012-05-22T15:21:00.000Z	ikonia	stueng	cp -R . /$newlocation
2012-05-22T15:22:00.000Z	ikonia	stueng	man cp for the flags
2012-05-27T00:10:00.000Z	ikonia	stueng	do they have their own channel ?
2012-05-27T00:22:00.000Z	ikonia	stueng	you can't share a desktop you don't have
2012-05-27T00:23:00.000Z	ikonia	stueng	doesn't work like that, you share a desktop (or at last manage the sharing via a desktop)
2012-05-27T00:23:00.000Z	ikonia	stueng	the individual X windows are managed by the window manager,
2012-05-30T20:30:00.000Z	ikonia	stueng	don't use server
2012-05-30T20:30:00.000Z	stueng	ikonia	I dont want a gui... I cant boot the mini.iso either.. so now what?
2012-05-30T20:30:00.000Z	ikonia	stueng	it's probably too old now to contain the full instruction set that the kernel wants
2012-05-30T20:30:00.000Z	ikonia	stueng	remove the gui, just see if the CD will boot
2012-05-30T20:37:00.000Z	stueng	ikonia	error says please use a kernel appropiate for your cpu... so I should get an old verstion of ubuntu ?
2012-05-30T20:38:00.000Z	ikonia	stueng	depends what it wants
2012-05-30T20:38:00.000Z	ikonia	stueng	it used to be a common issue with VM's booting the ubuntu CD's as they didn't emmulate a CPU with certain instructions/components
2012-05-30T20:39:00.000Z	ikonia	stueng	that dependency has been in place for a good few years now, so you may be out of luck
2012-05-30T20:39:00.000Z	stueng	ikonia	I would have thought linux would be better suited to run on an older CPU than any other os :(
2012-05-30T20:39:00.000Z	ikonia	stueng	"linux is" a lot of distributions aren't
