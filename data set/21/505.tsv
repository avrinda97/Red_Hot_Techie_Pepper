2011-11-07T11:19:00.000Z	h33lt0e		Does Wubi install ubuntu on its own partition?  What's the difference between using Wubi and installing from CD?
2011-11-07T11:20:00.000Z	h33lt0e		The reason being that I have been unsuccessful in trying to get my computer to boot from USB key, and don't have a cd-rom drive and was looking to use Wubi to install Ubuntu
2011-11-07T11:20:00.000Z	urlin2u	h33lt0e	wubi is a file in windows.
2011-11-07T11:21:00.000Z	urlin2u	h33lt0e	yes, do you know the out of the bios key prompt to choose the boot?
2011-11-07T11:22:00.000Z	urlin2u	h33lt0e	you tr f12 at powering on?
2011-11-07T11:22:00.000Z	urlin2u	h33lt0e	how are you loading the usb?
2011-11-07T11:24:00.000Z	urlin2u	h33lt0e	tap the shift key at powering on at the gui hit f6 then nomodeset for a low graphic boot sounds like a graphic card problem.
2011-11-07T11:25:00.000Z	urlin2u	h33lt0e	hard to say but unplug it if needed try the f6 plugged and unplugged.
2011-11-07T11:26:00.000Z	urlin2u	h33lt0e	start tapping as you turn it on it gets you to a early gui.
2011-11-07T11:27:00.000Z	urlin2u	h33lt0e	with unetbootin fat
2011-11-07T11:29:00.000Z	urlin2u	h33lt0e	on the web it says a nividia card so te problem is the graphic driver the low graphic should work.
2011-11-07T11:30:00.000Z	urlin2u	h33lt0e	if the usb is booting sounds like it is.
2011-11-07T11:34:00.000Z	urlin2u	h33lt0e	can you try the usb on another conputer to confirm it is good?
2011-11-07T11:46:00.000Z	h33lt0e	urlin2u	 usb did not boot on another computer, gave the same blinking cursor for about 2 minutes
2011-11-07T11:48:00.000Z	urlin2u	h33lt0e	sounds like the usb needs reloading reformat the usb and use a fat32, unetbootin run in admin in ubuntu i forget for windows.
2011-11-07T11:50:00.000Z	urlin2u	h33lt0e	you have it what config right now?
2011-11-07T11:50:00.000Z	h33lt0e	urlin2u	 I have it in fat32
2011-11-07T11:52:00.000Z	urlin2u	h33lt0e	you might try another loader pendrivelinux has several one for running ubuntu called multisystem, and I think the other called yum for windows.
2011-11-07T11:53:00.000Z	urlin2u	h33lt0e	here is the yum for windows use, yeah it may be a problem with unetbootin, never happened to e but it does happen. https://encrypted.google.com/url?url=http://www.pendrivelinux.com/yumi-multiboot-usb-creator/&rct=j&sa=U&ei=LoC3TvS9L8qPiAKMubRm&ved=0CBwQFjAB&q=+pendrivelinux+usb+loader&usg=AFQjCNG-iracoPBlmk_IfBJCXaKZy9dabg
