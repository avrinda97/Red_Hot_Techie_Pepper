2007-07-09T05:51:00.000Z	rolfen		i have installed jre 6 from java but it still not working
2007-07-09T05:52:00.000Z	macogw	rolfen	are you using desktop effects?
2007-07-09T05:52:00.000Z	rolfen	macogw	yeah
2007-07-09T06:56:00.000Z	macogw	rolfen	are you using beryl?
2007-07-09T06:56:00.000Z	macogw	rolfen	if so, turn it off
2007-07-09T06:56:00.000Z	rolfen	macogw	yes
2007-07-09T06:56:00.000Z	macogw	rolfen	turn it off
2007-07-09T06:56:00.000Z	macogw	rolfen	beryl + swing = doesnt work
2007-07-09T06:56:00.000Z	rolfen	macogw	thanks il try that
2007-07-09T06:57:00.000Z	macogw	rolfen	the only way to make it work is to put "AWT_TOOLKIT=MToolkit" in your .bashrc and then only run the java apps from the command line
2007-07-09T06:57:00.000Z	rolfen	macogw	thanks again :D
2007-07-09T06:57:00.000Z	rolfen	macogw	i'd hate to disable beryl
2007-07-09T06:58:00.000Z	macogw	rolfen	then do the command line thing. if you start up the java app with metacity then switch to beryl, itll stay there and not go blank
2007-07-09T06:59:00.000Z	rolfen	macogw	yeah it was a beryl issue... thanks
2007-07-09T06:59:00.000Z	rolfen	macogw	are they planning to fix that?
2007-07-09T06:59:00.000Z	macogw	rolfen	beryl's gone
2007-07-09T07:00:00.000Z	macogw	rolfen	its probably fixed in compiz fusion
2007-07-09T07:00:00.000Z	rolfen	macogw	true :)
2007-07-09T07:02:00.000Z	rolfen	macogw	you're a genius :D
2007-07-09T07:02:00.000Z	macogw	rolfen	i wish....my gpa wishes too
