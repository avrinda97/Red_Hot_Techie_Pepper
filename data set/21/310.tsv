2012-06-21T14:17:00.000Z	alo21		hi all
2012-06-21T14:18:00.000Z	alo21		I have a problem with python library
2012-06-21T14:19:00.000Z	alo21		I installed a library, but python can not find it
2012-06-21T14:21:00.000Z	kushal_kumaran	alo21	how did you install the library, and what error do you get?
2012-06-21T14:23:00.000Z	alo21	kushal_kumaran	I installed it via synaptic and I did not get any error
2012-06-21T14:25:00.000Z	kushal_kumaran	alo21	so it's a debian package? which one? might you be installing a python2 module and attempting to use it with python3 (or your custom python build)?
2012-06-21T14:26:00.000Z	alo21	kushal_kumaran	I downloaded the source from the website
2012-06-21T14:27:00.000Z	alo21	kushal_kumaran	I run ./configure then make and then make install
2012-06-21T14:27:00.000Z	alo21	kushal_kumaran	sorry
2012-06-21T14:27:00.000Z	alo21	kushal_kumaran	I make a mistake
2012-06-21T14:28:00.000Z	alo21	kushal_kumaran	I do not know if is a debian package I installed that module via synaptic... so I suppose yes
2012-06-21T14:29:00.000Z	kushal_kumaran	alo21	a bit confused: did you build python by hand using configure and make?  If so, python libraries installed using debian packages will not be found by that python.
2012-06-21T14:30:00.000Z	alo21	kushal_kumaran	yes. To install python 2.7, I did it by hand
2012-06-21T14:33:00.000Z	kushal_kumaran	alo21	then you need to install python libraries using python's mechanisms (such as running pip install <library>), rather than debian packages.
2012-06-21T14:35:00.000Z	kushal_kumaran	alo21	make sure to use your custom python when installing libraries, so you don't step on debian-owned files (virtualenv is extremely useful in such cases: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv)
2012-06-21T14:38:00.000Z	alo21	kushal_kumaran	maybe I should install python debian package
2012-06-21T14:40:00.000Z	alo21	kushal_kumaran	how can I remove python 2.7 if I installed it by hand?
2012-06-21T14:40:00.000Z	kushal_kumaran	alo21	debian stable has python2.6, testing has python2.7
2012-06-21T14:40:00.000Z	alo21	kushal_kumaran	does not matter
2012-06-21T14:41:00.000Z	kushal_kumaran	alo21	might not be a straightforward way, you might have to go snooping around in /usr/local for files installed by make install
2012-06-21T14:42:00.000Z	alo21	kushal_kumaran	ok... thanks a lot
