2009-04-06T02:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Shivam	sudo chmod 750 /path/to/file; sudo chown $USER /path/to/file
2009-04-06T02:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Shivam	if its a folder put -R after the word chmod and chown
2009-04-06T02:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Shivam	are you running winrar?
2009-04-06T02:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Shivam	just spotted it in your screenshow
2009-04-06T02:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Shivam	linux has a native rar handler
2009-04-06T02:48:00.000Z	Shivam	ActionParsnip	Okay so how would i go about removing the icon off my desktop?
2009-04-06T02:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Shivam	which icon exactly?
2009-04-06T02:48:00.000Z	Shivam	ActionParsnip	home folder
2009-04-06T02:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Shivam	try this: sudo chmod -R 750 /home/$USER; sudo chown -R $USER /home/$USER
2009-04-06T02:50:00.000Z	Shivam	ActionParsnip	that command is to remove just the icon off my desktop?
2009-04-06T02:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Shivam	no it will make sure you have correct access to your own data
2009-04-06T02:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Shivam	if you look in ~/Desktop you may see the icon, the fact that the permissions are bad isnt great
2009-04-06T02:53:00.000Z	Shivam	ActionParsnip	chmod: cannot access `/home/shivam/.gvfs': Permission denied
2009-04-06T02:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Shivam	did you use sudo? you can copy / paste to the terminal which is why I gave the full command
2009-04-06T02:53:00.000Z	Shivam	ActionParsnip	yes i used sudo
2009-04-06T02:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Shivam	your home folder permissions are all out of whack, probably because gui apps have been run with sudo
2009-04-06T02:56:00.000Z	Shivam	ActionParsnip	what do you suggest?
2009-04-06T02:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Shivam	reboot to root recovery console and do the same command there but use the actual user name
2009-04-06T02:58:00.000Z	Shivam	ActionParsnip	will do, thanks
