2009-08-08T11:56:00.000Z	_ged		hi guys, is there a command in the terminal wherein you can "unlock" the users and groups in the System>Administration>User and Groups ??
2009-08-08T11:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	_ged	 only the 'sudo  allowed/administrator' user can unloock that.  if you want other users to have the rights they need to also be in the admin group i belive
2009-08-08T11:59:00.000Z	_ged	Dr_Willis	i've already added a user into the admin group "adduser <user> admin"..but it still cannot "unlock" the users and group
2009-08-08T12:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	_ged	 logout/back in as that user.
2009-08-08T12:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	_ged	 there is no magical command. You have to be in the right group for it to work.
2009-08-08T12:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	_ged	 can your user  use 'sudo' at all?
2009-08-08T12:10:00.000Z	_ged	Dr_Willis	thanks
2009-08-08T12:11:00.000Z	_ged	Dr_Willis	yes, it can use sudo
2009-08-08T12:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	_ged	 that is weird then.   You could try 'gksudo users-admin'
2009-08-08T12:14:00.000Z	_ged	Dr_Willis	it prompts the users settings, but it displays Gtk-WARNING on the terminal, its about 12 lines of WARNING and CRITICAL on the last line
2009-08-08T12:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	_ged	 so the program shows?or  dosent show?
2009-08-08T12:15:00.000Z	_ged	Dr_Willis	the program shows...the User Settings
2009-08-08T12:15:00.000Z	_ged	Dr_Willis	the weird thing is, it doesnt ask for authentication when i opened the users settings using the panels
2009-08-08T12:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	_ged	 or learn to admin users as root via the command line.. You did try that 'gksudo users-admin' command.. if that dident work.. then somthing is very broken.
2009-08-08T12:39:00.000Z	_ged	Dr_Willis	is it with the package?
2009-08-08T12:39:00.000Z	_ged	Dr_Willis	i mean the "broken" thing
2009-08-08T12:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	_ged	  no idea on that.  but somthing is weird.
2009-08-08T12:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	_ged	 theres proberly things to try.. but those may be a bit insecure..
2009-08-08T12:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	_ged	 i normally just admin my  users via the command line.. but  i only have 3 users. :)
2009-08-08T12:41:00.000Z	_ged	Dr_Willis	i have 2 users on the admin group but both of them cant execute the "unlock"
2009-08-08T12:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	_ged	 yep. somthing is weird there.
