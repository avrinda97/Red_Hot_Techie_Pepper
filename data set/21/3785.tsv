2009-09-29T03:49:00.000Z	NetEcho		is there a way to install say ubuntu server from within a gentoo install?
2009-09-29T03:49:00.000Z	lfaraone	NetEcho	sure, assuming you can run debootstrap.
2009-09-29T03:50:00.000Z	lfaraone	NetEcho	do you want to replace gentoo, or what?
2009-09-29T03:50:00.000Z	NetEcho	lfaraone	yes the gentoo install on the dedi I have access to is completely botched, and I'm tired of dealing with gentoo
2009-09-29T03:51:00.000Z	lfaraone	NetEcho	do you have grub installed?
2009-09-29T03:51:00.000Z	NetEcho		let me check
2009-09-29T03:51:00.000Z	lfaraone	NetEcho	you could easily run unetbootin, but you'd need virtual console access.
2009-09-29T03:51:00.000Z	NetEcho		oi
2009-09-29T03:51:00.000Z	NetEcho		that I don't have
2009-09-29T03:51:00.000Z	NetEcho	lfaraone	what about onto another partition?
2009-09-29T03:52:00.000Z	NetEcho		there is already 2 partitions, Gentoo is on a 5gb and then I have /home on a 1.5tb partition
2009-09-29T03:52:00.000Z	lfaraone	NetEcho	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromLinux
2009-09-29T03:52:00.000Z	lfaraone	NetEcho	you want "without cd"
2009-09-29T03:53:00.000Z	NetEcho	lfaraone	will this also have ssh setup?
2009-09-29T03:53:00.000Z	NetEcho	lfaraone	cause I know generally ubuntu doesn't install  sshd by default
2009-09-29T03:53:00.000Z	lfaraone	NetEcho	not by default, you'll have to sudo apt-get install openssh-server inside the chroot and configure it.
2009-09-29T03:53:00.000Z	lfaraone		!sshd | NetEcho
2009-09-29T03:53:00.000Z	NetEcho		ok
2009-09-29T04:00:00.000Z	NetEcho		uhm lfaraone, without cd install relys on having ubuntu or debian installed,
2009-09-29T04:00:00.000Z	NetEcho		gentoo doesn't use apt
2009-09-29T04:00:00.000Z	lfaraone	NetEcho	you don't have debootstrap for gentoo?
