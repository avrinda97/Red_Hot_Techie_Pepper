2007-04-28T15:22:00.000Z	Kordite		Here's my story: I installed Ubuntu 6.04 on a laptop. It was good except that I couldn't get it to connect to my wireless network. Someone recommended that I upgrade. I upgraded to 7 and the pc would no longer shut down. And after hard power off it wouldn't boot up the first time. It's gotten worse and worse.. .
2007-04-28T15:23:00.000Z	Pelo	Kordite	 I suggest you get the cd to 7.04 and make a proper clean install, that whould resolve a lot of problems
2007-04-28T15:24:00.000Z	Kordite	Pelo	Did that. Re-partioned. Re-format. Clean install. Still unstable.
2007-04-28T15:25:00.000Z	Pelo	Kordite	 what is the current state or your comp,  I mean how far do you get when you boot and what msg if any do you get ?
2007-04-28T15:27:00.000Z	Kordite	Pelo	the latest install is an attempt to go back to 6, I get the ubuntu splash, the load bar and driver scroll, it then goes to a blank screen with a flashing cursor and stops.
2007-04-28T15:27:00.000Z	Pelo	Kordite	 what is your videocard ?
2007-04-28T15:27:00.000Z	Kordite	Pelo	actually, the cursor stops flashing.
2007-04-28T15:28:00.000Z	Pelo	Kordite	 what is your videocard ?
2007-04-28T15:28:00.000Z	Kordite	Pelo	Not sure. Whatever is in a Thinkpad T20.
2007-04-28T15:29:00.000Z	Kordite	Pelo	that could be related because when I updated from 6 I suddenly lost the 1024x768 and only had up to 640x480.
2007-04-28T15:29:00.000Z	Pelo	Kordite	that doesn't tell me much ,  the only thing I can suggest at this point is a clean install of 7.04, drivers are better
2007-04-28T15:30:00.000Z	Kordite	Pelo	After that, I clean installed 7 and that solved that video problem but it was unstable. It would take 3 or 4 reboots for it to finally come up.
2007-04-28T15:31:00.000Z	Pelo	Kordite	can you boot yoru computer now ????
2007-04-28T15:33:00.000Z	Kordite	Pelo	not at all. I did an install from the disk. It asks for the reboot. It doesn't want to shut down. I had reboot.It comes back up and completes the install and updates. Won't shut down. Hard reboot. Blank screen and frozen cursor.
2007-04-28T15:33:00.000Z	Pelo	Kordite	 ok  so the problem it that it won'T shutdown nicely,  got it now
2007-04-28T15:35:00.000Z	Kordite	Pelo	that's the first thing, but then it won't come back up, of course. I have a BIOS update that should probably be installed but it will only run from windows. I tried re-installing windows but could only get my 95 disk to install. The BIOS patch wouldn't run. Couldn't get the 98 to install. Ugh.
2007-04-28T15:36:00.000Z	Pelo	Kordite	  read this and see if it applies  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=340016&highlight=can%2527T+shutdown
2007-04-28T15:43:00.000Z	Kordite	Pelo	the link you pointed to seems similar except that I don't have any error or message when the shutdown fails. It just stops at a splash screen. Of course, holding down the power button shuts it off, so in and of itself the shutdown isn't the problem. The real grief is that it will not boot back up.
2007-04-28T15:43:00.000Z	Pelo	Kordite	 try the solution anyway, it can't realy hurt
2007-04-28T15:45:00.000Z	Kordite	Pelo	Kind of hard to try the solution when the PC will not boot. I'll have to try yet another clean install.
2007-04-28T15:46:00.000Z	Pelo	Kordite	that's the best I can do for you , I am sorry,  I,m just a user maybe one of the other know's how to fix your problem but I don't sorry
