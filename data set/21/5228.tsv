2008-05-28T08:28:00.000Z	john-mike		Hi! Can anyone help me get my Ipod to mount onto Hardy Heron? I've tried every single tutorial online, but for some reason it won't mount, show up on any software, or show up on the desktop when plugged in!
2008-05-28T08:28:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	john-mike	it doesn't even show up on the desktop?
2008-05-28T08:28:00.000Z	john-mike	IndyGunFreak	Nope. I kept reading that there should be an icon that shows up, but I've never see it!
2008-05-28T08:29:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	john-mike	is the ipod plugged in now?
2008-05-28T08:29:00.000Z	john-mike	IndyGunFreak	Yup
2008-05-28T08:29:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	john-mike	is it showing "Do not disconnect" or whatever, so its telling itself that its connected?
2008-05-28T08:30:00.000Z	john-mike	IndyGunFreak	Yeah, it charges and everything.
2008-05-28T08:31:00.000Z	john-mike	IndyGunFreak	Does it make a difference that it's an Ipod Touch?
2008-05-28T08:31:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	john-mike	uh, yes.
2008-05-28T08:31:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	john-mike	the ipod touch's havef some issues w/ linux.
2008-05-28T08:31:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	john-mike	google ipod touch and ubuntu, and it will show up most likely.. normal ipods work fine
2008-05-28T08:31:00.000Z	john-mike	IndyGunFreak	Well, that makes sense!  See, I kept reading that it would work like the others, so I kept assuming that it would.
2008-05-28T08:32:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	john-mike	not the touch.. the touches.. i think its a firmware issue...
2008-05-28T08:32:00.000Z	john-mike	IndyGunFreak	Ah....whew. Ok. That gives me a piece of mind that it's not me.  Ha ha
2008-05-28T08:33:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	john-mike	try looking here, ... http://www.linuxforums.org/forum/ubuntu-help/119543-mount-ipod-touch-ubuntu-8-04-a.html
2008-05-28T08:33:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	john-mike	but to my knowledge, they still dont' work.. they didn't as of the Gutsy, i know that, so maybe they dont work in hardy yet either
2008-05-28T08:35:00.000Z	john-mike	IndyGunFreak	Thanks a lot!
2008-05-28T08:36:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	john-mike	no prob.. good luck on that.. i've not heard much success w/ the Touch's
2008-05-28T08:36:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	john-mike	oddly enough,t he MS players work better than the Touch's.. which is kinda comical when you think about it.
2008-05-28T08:37:00.000Z	john-mike	IndyGunFreak	Yeah, but at least I know that its an issue right now that will come in time rather than me just making mistakes everywhere. :)
2008-05-28T08:37:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	john-mike	very true.
