2004-09-27T13:17:00.000Z	Parisi		Thats one reason i wanted to ditch Mepis off my second partition, not really a big fan of KDE
2004-09-27T13:18:00.000Z	Parisi		And it just seens KDE centric, like most distros these days anyways.
2004-09-27T13:18:00.000Z	Parisi		With the exception of Fedora
2004-09-27T13:19:00.000Z	Parisi		Excuse my poor english at the moment btw, brb.
2004-09-27T13:19:00.000Z	Parisi		How stable is this anyways?
2004-09-27T13:20:00.000Z	Parisi		Anyone here actually running it as a desktop OS ?
2004-09-27T13:20:00.000Z	Parisi		haha, how do you like it.
2004-09-27T13:20:00.000Z	Parisi		I wonder how well it will play with my picky hardware.
2004-09-27T13:21:00.000Z	Parisi		Sweet
2004-09-27T13:22:00.000Z	Parisi		I wish i could only find one distro that fully takes advantage of my hardware.
2004-09-27T13:22:00.000Z	aethyr	Parisi	what do you have that gives you problems?
2004-09-27T13:22:00.000Z	Parisi		I could never find one.
2004-09-27T13:23:00.000Z	Parisi		Well, i miss being able to use my "fn" shortcuts on my laptop, among other annoyances.
2004-09-27T13:23:00.000Z	Parisi		Would be nice if i was able to control brightness settings, vga/lcd, etc.
2004-09-27T13:24:00.000Z	Parisi		Its a Sony PIII 800 laptop.
2004-09-27T13:25:00.000Z	aethyr	Parisi	ah, a sony laptop, ouch ;)
2004-09-27T13:25:00.000Z	aethyr		I don't even know if windows fully supports them, hehe
2004-09-27T13:25:00.000Z	Parisi		Screen brightness is always set to high, as a result battery drains much faster.
2004-09-27T13:25:00.000Z	aethyr		(I mean, if you do a vanilla windows install)
2004-09-27T13:26:00.000Z	aethyr		hallo
2004-09-27T13:26:00.000Z	Parisi	aethyr	ya, its actually implented as software, so it ends up being OS dependent.
