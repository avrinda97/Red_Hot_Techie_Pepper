2007-02-27T15:38:00.000Z	mneptok	nowhere	802.11x works great for me, on both desktop and laptop. but i don't make hardware decisions based on color or cool LEDs. ;)
2007-02-27T15:40:00.000Z	mneptok	nowhere	i will. our support contracts are quite reasonably priced. ;)
2007-02-27T15:40:00.000Z	mneptok	nowhere	sudo aptitude install network-manager-gnome
2007-02-27T15:41:00.000Z	mneptok	nowhere	sudo aptitude install network-manager-gnome
2007-02-27T15:42:00.000Z	nowhere	mneptok	I already have, it only supports WEP
2007-02-27T15:42:00.000Z	mneptok	nowhere	no, it does WPA
2007-02-27T15:42:00.000Z	nowhere	mneptok	For me it doesn't
2007-02-27T15:42:00.000Z	mneptok	nowhere	i know because 1). i'm using it for WPA now -and- 2). i support this stuff for a living ;)
2007-02-27T15:43:00.000Z	nowhere	mneptok	Then please explain why it only lists WEP for me?
2007-02-27T15:43:00.000Z	mneptok	nowhere	what protocol does your WAP use by default?
2007-02-27T15:47:00.000Z	nowhere	mneptok	It's a Siemens Gigaset SX551 router (also known as experia box), the network card is a Linksys wmp54g (rt2500), encryption is set as WPA2-PSK / WPA-PSK. Using Windows XP the connection works fine, if I change it to WEP it works in Ubuntu too.
2007-02-27T15:50:00.000Z	mneptok	nowhere	disable any authentication on that router except WPA and see wha'ppens
2007-02-27T15:53:00.000Z	nowhere	mneptok	It's broadcasting the SSID, doesn't check for MAC addresses, options for encryption are: 1) WPA2-PSK, 2) WPA-2PSK / WPA-PSK, 3) WEP, 4) WPA2, 5) WPA2 / WPA. Option 2 is set with a keylength of 26 characters.
2007-02-27T15:54:00.000Z	mneptok	nowhere	disable any authentication on that router except WPA and see wha'ppens
2007-02-27T15:55:00.000Z	mneptok	nowhere	it could. does the card support WPA?
2007-02-27T15:56:00.000Z	nowhere	mneptok	Using it now with WPA @ WinXP
2007-02-27T15:56:00.000Z	mneptok	nowhere	so disable any authentication on that router except WPA and see wha'ppens
2007-02-27T15:56:00.000Z	nowhere	mneptok	I think nothing happens for I can't set WPA at network manager?
2007-02-27T15:57:00.000Z	nowhere	mneptok	But maybe things will be better for me when installing Edgy..
2007-02-27T16:11:00.000Z	nowhere	mneptok	my edgy disk is ready, will report back on progress :)
2007-02-27T17:21:00.000Z	nowhere	mneptok	Hi again, I have now installed edgy, took care of all updates + network-manager and rebooted. It so far only seems to detect my wired connection.
