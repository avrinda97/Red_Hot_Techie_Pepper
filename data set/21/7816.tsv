2007-12-18T10:42:00.000Z	ryancr		i am about to get one of these low power koolu machines, I am thinking of doing a ide->CF adaptor instead of a regular harddrive, anyone have any thoughts, experiences with running linux on a CF card
2007-12-18T10:43:00.000Z	kd7swh	ryancr	its not fun running linux on a cf they are slow
2007-12-18T10:43:00.000Z	ryancr	kd7swh	even the newer ones, the 266x are supposed to be something like 40MB/s
2007-12-18T10:44:00.000Z	kd7swh	ryancr	a sata dirve is 3GB/s
2007-12-18T10:44:00.000Z	ryancr	kd7swh	ah, well i don't have sata on this machine, whats a regular ide?
2007-12-18T10:45:00.000Z	kd7swh	ryancr	it varies 133mb/s - 266mb/s
2007-12-18T10:46:00.000Z	kd7swh	ryancr	what is your plan? is it for a server?
2007-12-18T10:46:00.000Z	ryancr	kd7swh	yeah its just a small inhome server, music, videos etc, storage on external drives, OS on the CF card (maybe)
2007-12-18T10:47:00.000Z	kd7swh	ryancr	cf would be too slow to stream video off of. if you just want to install the OS on the CF card and hold the media on a SATA or IDE you should be good to go
2007-12-18T10:48:00.000Z	ryancr	kd7swh	I think ill just go with a 7200 80gig drive, machine takes 2.5" drives, then I know it will just work ;)
2007-12-18T10:48:00.000Z	ryancr	kd7swh	i was just thinking of even less power consumption and less noise
2007-12-18T10:49:00.000Z	kd7swh	ryancr	if it were me I would just use the hard drive. 2.5'' drives don't use much power anyway.
2007-12-18T10:50:00.000Z	kd7swh	ryancr	as for noise cf would be quieter but too slow at about 3600 rpm
2007-12-18T10:53:00.000Z	kd7swh	ryancr	how much is it?

2007-12-18T10:55:00.000Z	ryancr	kd7swh	expensive: but actually less than i thought
2007-12-18T10:57:00.000Z	kd7swh	ryancr	check out this baby:   http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820147021
2007-12-18T10:58:00.000Z	ryancr	kd7swh	thats nice
2007-12-18T10:59:00.000Z	kd7swh	ryancr	a little small for my media. My media server (aka the closet beast) has a 1TB drive
2007-12-18T11:01:00.000Z	kd7swh	ryancr	if I were you I'd spring for this baby http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820609245
