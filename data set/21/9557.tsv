2005-08-31T15:00:00.000Z	TTilus	_ubuntu504	*-k6, *-k7 and *-k8 -packages are those amdies
2005-08-31T15:02:00.000Z	TTilus	_ubuntu504	depends, talking about kernels or?
2005-08-31T15:02:00.000Z	TTilus	_ubuntu504	if i recall correct they are downloadable over dialup
2005-08-31T15:03:00.000Z	_ubuntu504	TTilus	it automatically used a special kernal for my motherboard
2005-08-31T15:03:00.000Z	_ubuntu504	TTilus	a nvidia kernal
2005-08-31T15:04:00.000Z	TTilus	_ubuntu504	umm... nvidia kernel?  can't tell
2005-08-31T15:04:00.000Z	TTilus	_ubuntu504	i would guess that readily build kernels come with pretty much all chipsets supported

2005-08-31T15:05:00.000Z	_ubuntu504	TTilus	I am useing a NF7-s Rv2 motherboard
2005-08-31T15:05:00.000Z	_ubuntu504	TTilus	it uses a nvidia chipset... not for graphics though
