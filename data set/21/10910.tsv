2005-01-07T12:22:00.000Z	spikeb	rapha	yup
2005-01-07T12:22:00.000Z	rapha	spikeb	How is it called?
2005-01-07T12:25:00.000Z	spikeb	rapha	also, a program named coaster can do it
2005-01-07T12:25:00.000Z	rapha	spikeb	I got that installed. It doesn't do Audio CDs.
2005-01-07T12:28:00.000Z	rapha	spikeb	It _will_.
2006-05-27T05:04:00.000Z	spikeb	rapha	not likely
2006-05-27T05:04:00.000Z	rapha	spikeb	so I'll have to upgrade to Flight 7 if I can't afford compiling it myself?
2006-05-27T05:05:00.000Z	spikeb	rapha	yes, or wait until dapper stable comes out
2006-05-27T05:05:00.000Z	rapha	spikeb	That was my plan, but now I'm in a situation where I can't get on with my work due to certain limitations of FireFox 1.0 :-/
2006-05-27T05:06:00.000Z	spikeb	rapha	you should be able to compile it, if yo uhave enough space
2006-05-27T05:07:00.000Z	rapha	spikeb	no way. This is a 2001 iBook Clamshell with a 366MHz or so G3 and about 300MB of free disk space. Do you think it might be feasible to change the apt sources.list to Dapper and try an apt-get remove firefox && apt-get install firefox?
2006-05-27T05:07:00.000Z	spikeb	rapha	that would probably break things
2006-05-27T05:07:00.000Z	spikeb	rapha	if it helps any, i use dapper on a mac mini with zero problems.
2006-05-27T05:09:00.000Z	rapha	spikeb	yeah, gives me kind of a fuzzy feeling. But that probably means that our intern won't have her PC available to her today :)
2006-05-27T05:09:00.000Z	spikeb	rapha	haha
2006-05-27T05:10:00.000Z	rapha	spikeb	is there a chance I will be able to upgrade from Flight 7 to Dapper Drake Final when it is released without have to reinstall again?
2006-05-27T05:10:00.000Z	spikeb	rapha	yeah, i believe so
2006-05-27T05:10:00.000Z	spikeb	rapha	that's actually the assumption i'm working on for my install
2006-05-27T05:11:00.000Z	rapha	spikeb	kay, thx!
2006-06-19T06:11:00.000Z	rapha	spikeb	sucks, eh?
2006-06-19T06:12:00.000Z	rapha	spikeb	I tried it out once and got totally lost... in XChat you can see at the first glance what's going on in a channel
