2011-02-12T16:35:00.000Z	raisin123		Does anyone know how can I download just specific data from any site. Like just flash videos or just images or just links, etc ?
2011-02-12T16:35:00.000Z	mickster04	raisin123	right click for pics, select and copy for text? videos are harder
2011-02-12T16:36:00.000Z	raisin123	mickster04	What if there are like a thousand pics or around 20 videos and I said "links" not "text"..
2011-02-12T16:37:00.000Z	mickster04	raisin123	sounds like wget is your friend
2011-02-12T16:38:00.000Z	raisin123	mickster04	yes ofcourse. but as I said, how to download specific things via wget is beyond me.
2011-02-12T16:39:00.000Z	mickster04	raisin123	wget webaddress *.png <- something like that in a script and run it
2011-02-12T16:40:00.000Z	raisin123	mickster04	this will download only files with png format? But how will I know what format is the image file or video file in?
2011-02-12T16:40:00.000Z	mickster04	raisin123	technically you should ask the webmaster for permission, If theygive it it would be easier for them to zip up the files for you
2011-02-12T16:43:00.000Z	mickster04	raisin123	well if you write a script with a couple of wget's in fr the different things, I don't you can download the flash videos directly, they are usually on facebook, and you need to use another service for that
2011-02-12T16:45:00.000Z	mickster04	raisin123	well read up on wget
2011-02-12T16:45:00.000Z	raisin123	mickster04	I mean what I need to write in wget?
2011-02-12T16:45:00.000Z	raisin123	mickster04	wow, thanks I guess...
2011-02-12T16:45:00.000Z	mickster04	raisin123	there are manuals and examples, it's pretty useful tool to know about so it may well be worth you getting to know it
2011-02-12T16:46:00.000Z	raisin123	mickster04	yeah , I guess so. Thanks. :)
2011-02-17T03:44:00.000Z	mickster04	raisin123	sudo apt-get install kde-desktop   ?
2011-02-17T03:44:00.000Z	raisin123	mickster04	Is it that simple? are you sure?
2011-02-17T03:45:00.000Z	mickster04	raisin123	use synaptics to search for it
2011-02-17T03:45:00.000Z	mickster04	raisin123	just to be safe
2011-02-17T03:45:00.000Z	mickster04	raisin123	yeah
2011-02-17T03:47:00.000Z	mickster04	raisin123	open it....and click on the search box
2011-02-17T03:49:00.000Z	raisin123	mickster04	ok thanks.
