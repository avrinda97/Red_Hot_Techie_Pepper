2010-09-21T07:20:00.000Z	flan_suse		Anyone else see the partimage package in their package manager?
2010-09-21T07:20:00.000Z	flan_suse		For 10.04, that is...
2010-09-21T07:21:00.000Z	scott_ino	flan_suse	only partimage-doc according to apt-cache
2010-09-21T07:21:00.000Z	flan_suse	scott_ino	That can't be right...
2010-09-21T07:21:00.000Z	flan_suse	scott_ino	partimage is supposedly in the universe repo for 10.04.
2010-09-21T07:21:00.000Z	flan_suse	scott_ino	xbonesx is having the same problem: only partimage-doc
2010-09-21T07:22:00.000Z	scott_ino	flan_suse	updating... let's see
2010-09-21T07:22:00.000Z	flan_suse	scott_ino	I had him refresh his packages too.
2010-09-21T07:22:00.000Z	scott_ino	flan_suse	did tey change the package name
2010-09-21T07:22:00.000Z	flan_suse	scott_ino	Nope. It's called: partimage
2010-09-21T07:23:00.000Z	scott_ino	flan_suse	that's all im getting too... so...
2010-09-21T07:23:00.000Z	flan_suse	scott_ino	64-bit?
2010-09-21T07:23:00.000Z	scott_ino	flan_suse	yes
2010-09-21T07:23:00.000Z	flan_suse	scott_ino	That might be why...
2010-09-21T07:24:00.000Z	flan_suse	scott_ino	I only see an i386 package.
2010-09-21T07:25:00.000Z	scott_ino	flan_suse	perhaps there's a .deb out there somewhere or a ppa ?
2010-09-21T07:25:00.000Z	flan_suse	scott_ino	Hm, not sure. It's a popular program though.
2010-09-21T07:26:00.000Z	scott_ino	flan_suse	apparently it has issues with 64 bit http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=191205
2010-09-21T07:26:00.000Z	scott_ino	flan_suse	i mean couldn't you use another tool for now like clonezilla or something
2010-09-21T07:27:00.000Z	flan_suse	scott_ino	I recommended Clonezilla, since it's a LiveCD.
2010-09-21T07:27:00.000Z	scott_ino	flan_suse	i use it all the time it's wonderful
