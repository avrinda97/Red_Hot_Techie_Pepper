2008-04-27T17:48:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	albech	flicker bug?... i've not experienced any flickering
2008-04-27T17:49:00.000Z	albech	IndyGunFreak	the gfx hangs for 5 sec and after that you get random black frames (flickering) every 10-30 sec
2008-04-27T17:49:00.000Z	albech	IndyGunFreak	the first hang always happen when scrolling
2008-04-27T17:49:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	albech	absolutely nothing resembling that here... works perfect.
2008-04-27T18:42:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	albech	you're still having probs w/ that.. i thought intels were supposed to be easy

2008-04-27T18:44:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	albech	are you using 64bit?
2008-04-27T18:44:00.000Z	albech	IndyGunFreak	no 64 bit
2008-04-27T18:44:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	albech	can't you get it to work w/ ndiswrapperA?
2008-04-27T18:44:00.000Z	albech	IndyGunFreak	and i waited for them to fix the nvidia flicker bug all the time in 7.10 where they promised that 8.04 would have it fixed and its still here
2008-04-27T18:45:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	albech	i don't know, i have no flickering at all on my pc..

2009-11-01T18:40:00.000Z	albech	IndyGunFreak	why is that?
2009-11-01T18:40:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	albech	cuz 9.10 doesn't use xorg.conf... unless you do it manually
