2004-11-16T09:22:00.000Z	jamaas		Newbie here again... Is it possible for me to get a 2.4 kernel that is already compiled, and load it on this pc such that I I can boot from it or the regular 2.6 kernel?  Thanks
2004-11-16T09:23:00.000Z	Matt|	jamaas	unwise
2004-11-16T09:30:00.000Z	Matt|	jamaas	you can remove modules from the kernel by doing "sudo modprobe -r module_name"
2004-11-16T09:30:00.000Z	Matt|	jamaas	insert them by doing "modprobe module_name"
2004-11-16T09:31:00.000Z	Matt|	jamaas	you do not delete them when you remove them, you just unload them from the kernel
2004-11-16T09:37:00.000Z	Matt|	jamaas	stop using it?
2004-11-16T09:37:00.000Z	Matt|	jamaas	btw try and use my nick when replying to me, i.e.: "Matt|": that way I can see your message better and can answer quickly
2004-11-16T09:39:00.000Z	Matt|	jamaas	try using the tab button to complete nicks
2004-11-16T09:41:00.000Z	Matt|	jamaas	you know the tab button?
2004-11-16T09:41:00.000Z	Matt|	jamaas	start typing someones name
2004-11-16T09:41:00.000Z	Matt|	jamaas	try Mat
2004-11-16T09:42:00.000Z	jamaas	Matt|	yippeee  still an idiot but a slightly less offensive one ... !
2004-11-16T09:43:00.000Z	jamaas	Matt|	now these modules of mine ... its a bit of a circle.  hsfconfig will not work for me because the hsfmodules are not loaded (I think),, don't I at least get a smily face for something for learning the very difficult tab thing ....:-!
2004-11-16T09:44:00.000Z	jamaas	Matt|	now I feel better !
2004-11-16T09:45:00.000Z	Matt|	jamaas	ok are you chatting on the computer you're trying to fix?
2004-11-16T09:45:00.000Z	jamaas	Matt|	yup, with a sudo window open beside it
2004-11-16T09:46:00.000Z	jamaas	Matt|	ok, I presume they are loaded at boot time?
2004-11-16T09:47:00.000Z	jamaas	Matt|	Now your speakin my language!  hsfali
2004-11-16T09:47:00.000Z	Matt|	jamaas	"modprobe hsfali" what do that give you?
2004-11-16T09:48:00.000Z	jamaas	Matt|	returns Module hsfali not found
2004-11-16T09:49:00.000Z	Matt|	jamaas	right, so who told you you needed that module?
