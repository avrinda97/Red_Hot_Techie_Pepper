2007-09-18T11:33:00.000Z	Bogus8		I'm trying to run 7.04 on a dell deminsion 3000... it's freezing after the cd boot menu screen (I have tried noapic nolapic and it still goes blank)
2007-09-18T11:34:00.000Z	Bogus8		anyone got any ideas?
2007-09-18T11:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Bogus8	If you are sure you want to install it ( not just test the LiveCD ) you could try using the Alternate install CD
2007-09-18T11:35:00.000Z	Bogus8	Jordan_U	no, I need to recover some stuff of the HD (the current OS is hosed)
2007-09-18T11:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Bogus8	Might try Knoppix, do you get any errors?
2007-09-18T11:37:00.000Z	Bogus8	Jordan_U	nope, it get a little green matrix like stuff at the top for a sec before "loading kernel" then it goes blank
2007-09-18T11:42:00.000Z	Bogus8	Jordan_U	astro76: Knoppix 4 is working... does that give any insight?
2007-09-18T11:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Bogus8	Knoppix is probably the best
2007-09-18T11:44:00.000Z	Bogus8	Jordan_U	thanks... guess I'll keep that in my bag of tricks as well
2008-09-25T09:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Bogus8	Why do you assume nobody has?
2008-09-25T09:55:00.000Z	Bogus8	Jordan_U	I've searched high and low and can't find it... asked in here for several days and even less responses (today was the first day I got a response)
2008-09-25T09:56:00.000Z	Bogus8	Jordan_U	oddly enough there is a reference to a package that WOULD support it but that package doesn't exist
2008-09-25T09:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Bogus8	Do you know how to compile your own kernel?
2008-09-25T09:59:00.000Z	Bogus8	Jordan_U	I've done it in the past... but I really don't want to get away from the ubuntu kernel
2008-09-25T10:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Bogus8	I doubt that you will find an official Ubuntu kernel with reiser 4 support, and if you don't have a separate /boot it can't be a module.
2008-09-25T10:01:00.000Z	Bogus8	Jordan_U	I don't plan on using it for my root... it will be a mounted storage partition (raid 5)
2008-09-25T10:06:00.000Z	Bogus8	Jordan_U	how would I do it in a module... given I don't need /boot or / to live on the reiser4 system?
2008-09-25T10:20:00.000Z	Bogus8	Jordan_U	you still around?
2008-09-25T10:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Bogus8	Yes
2008-09-25T10:21:00.000Z	Bogus8	Jordan_U	did you get my question about how to make it work as a module?
2008-09-25T10:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Bogus8	I don't know.
