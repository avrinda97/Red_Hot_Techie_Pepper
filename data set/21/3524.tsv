2009-03-03T01:21:00.000Z	jschall		switching from kubuntu to ubuntu should just involve installing ubuntu-desktop and then removing kubuntu-desktop, right?
2009-03-03T01:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	jschall	not quite
2009-03-03T01:22:00.000Z	jschall	sebsebseb	already got it
2009-03-03T01:22:00.000Z	jschall	sebsebseb	someone beat you to it
2009-03-03T01:22:00.000Z	jschall	sebsebseb	thanks, that helps
2009-03-03T01:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	jschall	you might want to run some KDE apps in Gnome/Ubuntu though, but you can install those later anyway
2009-03-03T01:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	jschall	and I assume  you don't like KDE4 then  I don't either,  KDE3 was nice
2009-03-03T01:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	jschall	that is as a GUI.  KDE4  has apps  that improved though
2009-03-03T01:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	jschall	oh right yeah KDE4 is still buggy here and there
2009-03-03T01:24:00.000Z	jschall	sebsebseb	and flash in konqueror just doesn't seem to happen
2009-03-03T01:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	jschall	KDE3  is nice and mature been around for years, but you won't get it from the Intrepid Ibex repo, but if you got Hardy Heron you can  get it from that
2009-03-03T01:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	jschall	I prefer  Gnome  over KDE3 and 4, but KDE3 is nice
2009-03-03T01:24:00.000Z	jschall	sebsebseb	i'd rather just keep my 2 boxes the same, i'm going to go with gnome
2009-03-03T01:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	jschall	well   as long as you got enough RAM, woudn't hurt giving   Kubuntu KDE3 a try  in  a virtual machine
2009-03-03T01:25:00.000Z	jschall	sebsebseb	kde4 is definitely more advanced, and if it gets a bunch of fixes i'll probably switch to it.
2009-03-03T01:26:00.000Z	jschall	sebsebseb	i'd rather just stick to gnome
2009-03-03T01:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	jschall	ok, but  trust me KDE3 is so worth trying
2009-03-03T01:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	jschall	also  if you like Gnome may as well give xubuntu a try as well,  like Gnome more light waight
2009-03-03T01:27:00.000Z	jschall	sebsebseb	nah
2009-04-25T06:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	jschall	I guess since the version Ubuntu has is not the GPL one
2009-04-25T06:45:00.000Z	jschall	sebsebseb	send that to Horusofoz1, not me...
