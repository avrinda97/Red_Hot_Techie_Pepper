2010-11-27T14:38:00.000Z	magicjoe		OK i need help with somethng easy. i found a radeon driver i think i need. it was a tar.gz. i extracted it. it says to run ./configure then make then make install. well the ./configure worked great.....now make errors. what am i doing wrong. im a noob to this
2010-11-27T14:39:00.000Z	Moreliini	magicjoe	what are the errors?
2010-11-27T14:41:00.000Z	magicjoe	Moreliini	i cd to the directory and then did ./configure. but when i type make, it says no target specified. im in the folder!
2010-11-27T14:41:00.000Z	Moreliini	magicjoe	Is there a Makefile in there?
2010-11-27T14:42:00.000Z	magicjoe	Moreliini	there are 2 a .am and a .in
2010-11-27T14:42:00.000Z	magicjoe	Moreliini	i got the tar.gz from here https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-ati/1:6.13.0-1ubuntu5
2010-11-27T14:42:00.000Z	Moreliini	magicjoe	and the configure script said it was successful
2010-11-27T14:44:00.000Z	magicjoe	Moreliini	ah no. it did a bunch of stuff, but now it says requirements not met. no package xorg-server no package fontproto
2010-11-27T14:45:00.000Z	magicjoe	Moreliini	so what does that mean for me? look for those packages in synaptic? or do they need to be in this folder? am i supposed to be in the root of the unzipped file, or in the /src folder?
2010-11-27T14:46:00.000Z	Moreliini	magicjoe	You'll run make in the root where the Makefile is, not src. Apt-get the dependencies
2010-11-27T14:47:00.000Z	Moreliini	magicjoe	You should not need to copy anything else over into the project dir
2010-11-27T14:48:00.000Z	magicjoe	Moreliini	sudo apt-get install xorg-server says couldn't find package!
2010-11-27T14:49:00.000Z	Moreliini	magicjoe	xserver-xorg-dev should include whatever you might need
2010-11-27T14:56:00.000Z	magicjoe	Moreliini	ok, got past that part, but still not complete in the ./configure. need xf86driproto any idea where to get that? apt-get install says not found
2010-11-27T14:57:00.000Z	Moreliini	magicjoe	apt-cache search xf86driproto
2010-11-27T15:02:00.000Z	magicjoe	Moreliini	ok so if i did that successfully, and the make ran, but then i get a bunch of errors on make install......does that mean this driver is not for me?
2010-11-27T15:03:00.000Z	Moreliini	magicjoe	you ran make and it succeeded?
2010-11-27T15:04:00.000Z	magicjoe	Moreliini	nope make did NOT succeed. sorry. a bunch of struct radeon_dri has no member named....depthBits.....etcetera
2010-11-27T15:06:00.000Z	Moreliini	magicjoe	me too, when you return let me know what you're trying to do
2010-11-27T15:11:00.000Z	magicjoe	Moreliini	well, since updating through update manager to lucid, my video card is not working. im powerpc
2010-11-27T15:12:00.000Z	magicjoe	Moreliini	was all working perfect before this update!
