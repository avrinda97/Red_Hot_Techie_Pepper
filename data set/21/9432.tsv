2005-11-22T08:42:00.000Z	DaaJeH	cafuego	thanks
2005-11-22T08:44:00.000Z	cafuego	DaaJeH	Well, normally they wouldn't do the second part at all, but you might be lucky.
2005-11-22T08:45:00.000Z	DaaJeH	cafuego	Can you explain more please
2005-11-22T08:45:00.000Z	DaaJeH	cafuego	hummmm. I see urs like i.am.cafuego.geek.nz
2005-11-22T08:46:00.000Z	DaaJeH	cafuego	how do you get to do that?
2005-11-22T08:47:00.000Z	cafuego	DaaJeH	I have a rackmounted server at a hosting provider, which comes with up to 32 IP addresses (for an extra charge) that I can configure to use with any domain names I have also bought.
2005-11-22T08:47:00.000Z	cafuego	DaaJeH	The hosting provider owns the IP addresses and allow me to customise how they appear via an interface to add or chnage entries on their domain name server.
2005-11-22T08:51:00.000Z	DaaJeH	cafuego	: How about you? how much you pay?
2005-11-22T08:51:00.000Z	cafuego	DaaJeH	Around AU$300 per month
2005-11-22T08:52:00.000Z	cafuego	DaaJeH	(for a managed server and a handful of addresses)
2005-11-22T08:52:00.000Z	DaaJeH	cafuego	dollars?
2005-11-22T08:52:00.000Z	cafuego	DaaJeH	Yes
2005-11-22T08:53:00.000Z	DaaJeH	cafuego	too much!
2005-11-22T08:53:00.000Z	cafuego	DaaJeH	No, not really.
2005-11-22T08:54:00.000Z	cafuego	DaaJeH	Well, it IS too much if all you want is a custom reverse dns entry.
2005-11-22T08:54:00.000Z	cafuego	DaaJeH	I never mentioned the US. Bah.
2005-11-22T08:54:00.000Z	cafuego	DaaJeH	This is a server that hosts web and mail for 80+ clients, not just a toy so i can have a cute name on irc ;-)
2005-11-22T08:55:00.000Z	DaaJeH	cafuego	how much would it be in U.S?
