2012-10-19T19:29:00.000Z	javaJake	pestilence	take a look at Pidgin as an alternative
2012-10-19T19:30:00.000Z	pestilence	javaJake	ah, ok.  sounds like the best plan.  don't know why they had to go and break empathy.
2012-10-19T19:30:00.000Z	javaJake	pestilence	they didn't "break" it; it works fine. But I can understand your mistrust of software.
2012-10-19T19:31:00.000Z	pestilence	javaJake	well, with my setup, they did.  empathy worked fine yesterday in 12.04 and it doesn't work today.
2012-10-19T19:31:00.000Z	javaJake	pestilence	sounds like all they did is change empathy to use an oauth-esque authentication so they don't store your passwrod.
2012-10-19T19:32:00.000Z	pestilence	javaJake	ah, ok.  what about those using 2-factor authentication?  does it have to cache your credentials someplace?
2012-10-19T19:33:00.000Z	javaJake	pestilence	it's equivalent in security to 2-factor auth
2012-10-19T19:40:00.000Z	javaJake	pestilence	and, to be honest, it's not useful yet anyway
2012-10-19T19:34:00.000Z	pestilence	javaJake	what I mean is, if you have 2-factor authentication enabled for your google account, how is that handled?  with the jabber client, you just made a "application-specific" password that would be stored by empathy, but that no longer functions.
2012-10-19T19:36:00.000Z	javaJake	pestilence	it means that your app-specific password is no longer used, but you will need to type your time-specific PIN.
2012-10-19T19:37:00.000Z	pestilence	javaJake	*sigh*, I guess I will try it :)
2012-10-19T19:37:00.000Z	javaJake	pestilence	Google will give GNOME the information it needs to login in the future, but that info is easy for you to invalidate from your Google account later.
2012-10-19T19:37:00.000Z	pestilence	javaJake	you must mean Unity?
2012-10-19T19:37:00.000Z	javaJake	pestilence	yes :)
2012-10-19T19:38:00.000Z	pestilence	javaJake	here's my issue.  I don't really want "Unity" to be able to access my google account.  So I guess pidgin it is!
2012-10-19T19:38:00.000Z	javaJake	pestilence	yep
2012-10-19T19:39:00.000Z	pestilence	javaJake	I used pidgin for years anyways, so I'm good with that.  I had just gotten used to using empathy.
2012-10-19T19:39:00.000Z	javaJake	pestilence	if it helps, you can turn on and off specific Google features (Contacts, Chat, Calendar) once you've added the account.
2012-10-19T19:40:00.000Z	pestilence	javaJake	I'd rather just not have such tight integration with the desktop.  Call me paranoid, call me old.  But I guarantee you I'm not alone :)
2012-10-19T19:40:00.000Z	javaJake	pestilence	you are not :)
2012-10-19T19:41:00.000Z	pestilence	javaJake	I mean...I don't even trust Firefox to store my credentials for google (hence 2-factor authentication)...what makes you think I'd want my fricken windows manager to store it!
