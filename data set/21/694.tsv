2012-02-14T21:35:00.000Z	gr33n7007h		need help running vlc as root!
2012-02-14T21:35:00.000Z	theadmin	gr33n7007h	You can't and that's a bad idea anyway
2012-03-10T13:30:00.000Z	theadmin	gr33n7007h	Try them all. Gnome is somewhat unnatural, it is hard to get used to. KDE is Windows-like. XFCE feels similar to Gnome2 (like the old, pre-Natty Ubuntu desktops). *box'es are pretty confusing at first, but WAY lightweight. LXDE is also Windows-like, but whereas KDE feels like, say, Windows 7 (with a load more features), LXDE feels like Windows 95 xD
2012-03-10T13:32:00.000Z	theadmin	gr33n7007h	You probably can, but none of the official Ubuntu CDs come with Flux
2012-06-20T13:25:00.000Z	theadmin	gr33n7007h	Unlikely, but I think other players can handle its formats
2012-08-07T00:33:00.000Z	theadmin	gr33n7007h	alias start_wireless="wpa_supplicant -B -D wext -i wlan1 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicnt.conf -dd"
2012-08-07T00:33:00.000Z	gr33n7007h	theadmin	the do i just tyoe start_wireless?
2012-08-07T00:33:00.000Z	theadmin	gr33n7007h	Yeah, you can make it shorter too, like "wi" or something.
2012-08-07T00:34:00.000Z	gr33n7007h	theadmin	thank you very much ;D
2012-08-07T00:34:00.000Z	theadmin	gr33n7007h	To make it permanent, save it to ~/.bashrc. Also add sudo at the start of the command as "sudo start_wireless" won't work.
2012-08-11T11:28:00.000Z	gr33n7007h	theadmin	apt-get install broadcom-sta-common
2012-08-11T11:28:00.000Z	theadmin	gr33n7007h	Wish it was so simple, it doesn't auto-build the module -_-
2012-08-11T11:29:00.000Z	gr33n7007h	theadmin	You on 12.04
2012-08-11T11:30:00.000Z	theadmin	gr33n7007h	Yes
2012-08-11T11:30:00.000Z	theadmin	gr33n7007h	Because, well, they won't load
2012-08-11T11:32:00.000Z	theadmin	gr33n7007h	Please see: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1140622/
2012-08-11T11:37:00.000Z	theadmin	gr33n7007h	So any idea? I'm desperate to get this working... I'm thinking to reinstall but this is a 64-bit system and so the !clone command ubottu provides won't work, and I hardly remember what I installed anymore
2012-08-11T11:38:00.000Z	gr33n7007h	theadmin	got me!
2012-08-11T11:38:00.000Z	theadmin	gr33n7007h	?
2012-08-11T11:38:00.000Z	gr33n7007h	theadmin	beyond me
2012-08-11T11:39:00.000Z	theadmin	gr33n7007h	Eh, I see... Bwah. Well, I'll reinstall, just gotta backup my /home somewhere
