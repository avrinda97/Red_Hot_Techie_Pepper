2006-11-24T12:20:00.000Z	sethk	Jager-	people join and leave all the time.  for example, I don't know what you asked
2006-11-24T12:20:00.000Z	sethk	Jager-	but it sounds like you got an answer  :)
2006-11-24T12:21:00.000Z	sethk	Jager-	although I'm having difficulty imagining what defragging is going to do here.
2006-11-24T12:21:00.000Z	sethk	Jager-	yes, I know.  to solve what problem?
2006-11-24T12:23:00.000Z	sethk	Jager-	you are simply trying to resize your partition too much, given the data on it.  remember that there is file system overhead, and you can't shrink it to a size that's the same as the "used" space.
2006-11-24T12:23:00.000Z	sethk	Jager-	no, I suppose it won't hurt anything, but it won't get you very far.
2006-11-24T12:24:00.000Z	sethk	Jager-	the log you pointed me at says "spacee in use, 61088mb"
2006-11-24T12:26:00.000Z	sethk	Jager-	just search for "space in use"
2006-11-24T12:27:00.000Z	sethk	Jager-	that I don't know, I don't use it.
2006-11-24T12:28:00.000Z	sethk	Jager-	try it.  it will tell you, at least, whether size is the root of the problem, or not.
2006-11-24T13:32:00.000Z	Jager-	sethk	: I tried resizing it to 77 gb... and it still says it cant resize
