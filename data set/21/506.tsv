2011-11-07T04:38:00.000Z	matlock		i came here cause of the problems with the experimental 3d support
2011-11-07T04:39:00.000Z	matlock		was told to install the nvidia drivers from nvidia's website
2011-11-07T04:39:00.000Z	matlock		they broke my games
2011-11-07T04:39:00.000Z	headdrikka	matlock	what driver are you running ?
2011-11-07T04:39:00.000Z	matlock		i uninstalled, re activiating the experimental one
2011-11-07T04:39:00.000Z	matlock		now it's broke all to hell
2011-11-07T04:40:00.000Z	headdrikka		I've found that the only drivers to work well are the Nvidia ones
2011-11-07T04:41:00.000Z	matlock	TimothyA	actually, i am of the belief now that ubuntu just likes to be broken and no one knows how to fix it
2011-11-07T04:42:00.000Z	headdrikka	matlock	I have no such problems
