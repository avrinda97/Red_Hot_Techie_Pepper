2008-05-27T05:14:00.000Z	kex		i'm running 7.10 livecd if that matters
2008-05-27T05:16:00.000Z	alan_m	kex	have you done this?
2008-05-27T05:17:00.000Z	kex	alan_m	no, why should i have to download 120mb of packages to get flash running?
2008-05-27T05:18:00.000Z	alan_m	kex	have you actually read it before? (just asking so im not repeating information someone else might have given you.)
2008-05-27T05:19:00.000Z	kex	alan_m	yeah, there are all sorts of packages which i don't need, i only need flash, and i am on the live cd
2008-05-27T05:20:00.000Z	alan_m	kex	I believe that site is ONLY for flash..im not getting you to download the whole restricted extras package, with all the other stuff.
2008-05-27T05:20:00.000Z	kex	alan_m	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras, is what it tells me to do
2008-05-27T05:21:00.000Z	alan_m	kex	try sudo aptitude install flashplugin-nonfree
2008-05-27T05:21:00.000Z	alan_m	kex	have you done this before?
2008-05-27T05:24:00.000Z	kex	alan_m	it installs. but it does not work, here is the error http://pastebin.ca/1030559
