2009-02-02T00:28:00.000Z	binarymutant	psilocybin	it means it installed and updated your modules
2009-02-02T00:29:00.000Z	binarymutant	psilocybin	should, but the driver looks very much deprecated
2009-02-02T00:29:00.000Z	binarymutant	psilocybin	the make had lots of warnings
2009-02-02T00:30:00.000Z	binarymutant	psilocybin	using it?
2009-02-02T00:31:00.000Z	binarymutant	psilocybin	maybe modprobe ctfxi
2009-02-02T00:31:00.000Z	binarymutant	psilocybin	or a restart would suffice
2009-02-02T00:32:00.000Z	binarymutant	psilocybin	then the driver might be lame srry :/   I have some url's if you need them

2009-02-02T00:35:00.000Z	binarymutant	psilocybin	that's really weird, every reboot? or just random?
