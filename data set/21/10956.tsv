2010-06-21T06:39:00.000Z	adebaba		do i need to install the printer driver
2010-06-21T06:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	adebaba	 depends on the printer. It auto-installed the needed drivers formy printers here when i added it using the system -> admin -> printers tool
2010-06-21T06:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	adebaba	 you can burn a dozen+ live cd's and put them in every machine. so you can test the os out if you want to. with no changes to the box;s
2010-06-21T06:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	adebaba	 install samba, and edit the /etc/samba/smb.conf as needed workgroup is defined in there.
2010-06-21T06:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	adebaba	 but why does a Cybercafe need a 'workgroup' ?
2010-06-21T06:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	adebaba	 with windows box's you install and configure 'samba' and set up windows type shares
2010-06-21T06:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	adebaba	 we dont know what you are 'using' now - You can connect to irc from any IRC client.... what  did you do to start/boot the pc?
2010-06-21T06:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	adebaba	 and what did you download?  If you are running your own cybercafe - you really should be paying attention to such things.
2010-06-21T06:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	adebaba	 correct theres 100's of linux distrubutions.. we CANT tell what you are using.
2010-06-21T06:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	adebaba	 so you need to pay attention to what disrto you downloaded and installed..
2010-06-21T06:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	adebaba	 err... LOOK at the web site  and the links you downloaded from? if you downloaded some iso file.. it proberly has some filename thats a hint..
2010-06-21T06:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	adebaba	 if you want 'ubuntu' you shoudl be gettting uit from  the ubuntu.com  sites.
2010-06-21T06:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	adebaba	 never heard of it.. its not ubuntu.  so its basically not supported here.
