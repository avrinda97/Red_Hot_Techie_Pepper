2007-10-18T11:39:00.000Z	alromaithi		when updating from feisty to gutsy must i remove my install thirdparty compiz that wasnt from the repo
2007-10-18T11:41:00.000Z	alromaithi		so i must remove compiz which was installed from a thirdparty  like forexample the get , but not from repo , i think its dangerouse to update because the built in compiz will clash with thiis one i have unless i remove it ? Or gutsy checks for the identical and do it for me?
2007-10-18T11:42:00.000Z	Flannel	alromaithi	You're better off removing third party stuff
2007-10-18T11:43:00.000Z	Flannel	alromaithi	Did you install to /opt or /usr/local by any chance?
2007-10-18T11:45:00.000Z	Flannel	alromaithi	uh, what are some binaries from compiz?  I'm not familiar with it, but `which [program]` will tell you where the binary is.
2007-10-18T11:45:00.000Z	alromaithi	Flannel	this is the exact way i installed compiz http://forum.compiz-fusion.org/showthread.php?t=1985
2007-10-18T11:46:00.000Z	Flannel	alromaithi	Luckily, it *appears* that that's all in /usr/local/ which means removal should be fairly painless.  Relatively speaking
2007-10-18T11:46:00.000Z	Flannel	alromaithi	However, the makefile has an uninstall: http://forum.compiz-fusion.org/showpost.php?s=6b7e5b29f075c335aca1fa70a90fb29b&p=16634&postcount=8
2007-10-18T11:47:00.000Z	Flannel	alromaithi	or, so that forum claims anyway.  Even if it doesnt, since its in your local stuff, its definatey doable
2007-10-18T11:55:00.000Z	alromaithi	Flannel	i did make uninstall for each folder lo
2007-10-18T11:56:00.000Z	Flannel	alromaithi	You need to do it in the folder with the source.  That of course assumes you still have that folder
2007-10-18T11:58:00.000Z	alromaithi	Flannel	but i did what fyda explained , i dont understand so i delete the files from my home folder ? isnt the program running in the heart of linux with the lib files ? i remember installing many lib's :/
2007-10-18T11:58:00.000Z	Flannel	alromaithi	No.  Don't delete your home folder.  Your home folder won't need to be deleted.  The stuff you need to delete is some of the files in /usr/local/, things in /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/lib, and so on
2007-10-18T11:59:00.000Z	alromaithi	Flannel	thanks now i know what program files mean in linux lo
2007-10-18T12:01:00.000Z	alromaithi	Flannel	 last question :( i cant delete them no permission
2007-10-18T12:01:00.000Z	Flannel	alromaithi	you'll need to use sudo
2007-10-18T12:02:00.000Z	alromaithi	Flannel	sudo ? sudo delete ? or :/
2007-10-18T12:03:00.000Z	Flannel	alromaithi	you're going to have to prefix your commands with sudo to get them to work on system directories.  If you want to do it graphically, alt-f2 then `gksu nautilus` and it'll open a root nautilus window.  Delete stuff and close that window as soon as possible.  DONT use it to do anything else.
2007-10-18T12:04:00.000Z	Flannel	alromaithi	No, close the window it brings up (it'll be a file browser sort of thing)
2007-10-18T12:05:00.000Z	alromaithi	Flannel	how to delete i type cd /usr/local/lib now im in theyr i see the compiz files
2007-10-18T12:20:00.000Z	Flannel	alromaithi	alt-f2, gksu nautilus, use the window that pops up, and close it as SOON as youre done.  Don't do anything else with that window except your compiz removal
