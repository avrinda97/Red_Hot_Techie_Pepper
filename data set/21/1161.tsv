2011-02-20T04:34:00.000Z	Chipzzz		Docfixit: try sudo apt-get check, or does the system not come up at all?
2011-02-20T04:35:00.000Z	Docfxit	Chipzzz	Ubuntu comes up.  The app doesn't come up.
2011-02-20T04:37:00.000Z	Docfxit	Chipzzz	double commander
2011-02-20T04:38:00.000Z	Docfxit	Chipzzz	It installes fine.  When I run it from terminal I get the error.
2011-02-20T04:40:00.000Z	Docfxit	Chipzzz	no.  I installed it with software center.
2011-02-20T04:40:00.000Z	Docfxit	Chipzzz	It's downloaded.  How can I install it with root?
2011-02-20T04:41:00.000Z	Docfxit	Chipzzz	yes
2011-02-20T05:06:00.000Z	Docfxit	Chipzzz	I get a command prompt with no errors.
2011-02-20T05:08:00.000Z	Docfxit	Chipzzz	I'm running on a usb thumbdrive.  Does Ubuntu know to write all changes to the persistant partition?
2011-02-20T05:10:00.000Z	Docfxit	Chipzzz	It said 1 newly installed.
2011-02-20T05:13:00.000Z	Docfxit	Chipzzz	When I run it I get an error with lots of lines that start with Start watching.
2011-02-20T05:17:00.000Z	Docfxit	Chipzzz	The next line says: Cannot get device list  (only when you get a chance.  I realize you are busy)
2011-02-20T05:19:00.000Z	Chipzzz	Docfxit	are you starting it as root? i.e. (gksudo doublecmd)
2011-02-20T05:24:00.000Z	Docfxit	Chipzzz	When I start it as root I don't get the error.  It also doesn't run.
2011-02-20T05:24:00.000Z	Chipzzz	Docfxit	lol... are there any error messages?
2011-02-20T05:25:00.000Z	Docfxit	Chipzzz	no error messages.
2011-02-20T05:26:00.000Z	Chipzzz	Docfxit	try typing "locate doublecmd" and when you get the full path, type that
2011-02-20T05:27:00.000Z	Chipzzz	Docfxit	(precede the full path with gksudo, of course)
2011-02-20T05:34:00.000Z	Chipzzz	Docfxit	I'm out of ideas, but here's a link to the doublecmd forum... maybe there's some help there: http://doublecmd.sourceforge.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=5
2011-02-20T05:36:00.000Z	Docfxit	Chipzzz	Thank you very much for all your help.
2011-02-20T05:38:00.000Z	Chipzzz	Docfxit	if you are still here, I found this, which might help: http://ubuntu.se/archive/index.php/t-14899.html?s=edd5884cb0c89b448ad2bd9807bf1b87
