2005-10-31T09:35:00.000Z	Paradosso		got an interesting matter here
2005-10-31T09:36:00.000Z	Paradosso		trying to compile museek undre breezy
2005-10-31T09:37:00.000Z	Paradosso		error is described here: http://forums.slsknet.org/ipb/index.php?showtopic=4675
2005-10-31T09:38:00.000Z	paulproteus	Paradosso	Hold on a sec, let me investigate this.
2005-10-31T09:40:00.000Z	paulproteus	Paradosso	Do you have build-essential installed?
2005-10-31T09:40:00.000Z	Paradosso	paulproteus	check this out too: http://thegraveyard.org/daelstorm/museekfaq.php
2005-10-31T09:40:00.000Z	paulproteus	Paradosso	I was just reading that. :)
2005-10-31T09:41:00.000Z	paulproteus	Paradosso	Install it.
2005-10-31T09:42:00.000Z	paulproteus	Paradosso	If that makes the difference, email the museek guy and tell him to put that in the FAQ: "To compile this in Ubuntu, I had to install install build-essential."
2005-10-31T09:45:00.000Z	Paradosso	paulproteus	it works so far!
2005-10-31T09:46:00.000Z	paulproteus	Paradosso	If it works out in the end, then I *urge* you to email the guy who wrote it with what I said.
2005-10-31T09:49:00.000Z	paulproteus	Paradosso	install libqt3-mt-dev, iirc
2005-10-31T09:49:00.000Z	paulproteus	Paradosso	Once you're done, you should email the guy a list of Ubuntu packages required to compile his thing.
2005-10-31T09:51:00.000Z	paulproteus	Paradosso	iirc means "if I recall correctly"
2005-10-31T09:53:00.000Z	Paradosso	paulproteus	I just think I have to set $QTDIR to include /usr/lib/qt3 path
2005-10-31T09:53:00.000Z	paulproteus	Paradosso	Okay.
2005-10-31T09:58:00.000Z	paulproteus	Paradosso	Back in "the bad old days", one had to try doing ./configure --with-qt-headers and --with-qt-libraries .  Try those.
2005-10-31T09:59:00.000Z	Paradosso	paulproteus	museek builds through sconstruct, does your piece of advice applies the same?
2005-10-31T09:59:00.000Z	paulproteus	Paradosso	I don't know about sconstruct.
2005-10-31T10:06:00.000Z	Paradosso	paulproteus	I had to set QTDIR to the libqt3-mt-dev package path /usr/share/qt3, not the libqt3-mt one (/usr/lib/qt3)
