2009-08-19T23:24:00.000Z	joep		I'll refrase. I just installed virtualbox 3.04 on my 4-core AMD running ubuntu jaunty. When I start virtualbox from the applications menue _> system, the first screen comes up and then the whole system freezes completely. I can reach the system from another computer with SSH but I cannot revive it. Anybody has ideas?
2009-08-19T23:26:00.000Z	minimec	joep	If you can access the machine do a 'sudo killall gdm' first.
2009-08-19T23:27:00.000Z	joep	minimec	thanks. I did from a terminal /etc/init.d/gdm stop ( I had root rights) but nothing happened except it did tell me gdm wsa stoppend but that was not true.
2009-08-19T23:27:00.000Z	minimec	joep	np
2009-08-19T23:28:00.000Z	joep	minimec	what do you mean??
2009-08-19T23:28:00.000Z	minimec	joep	nothing... sorry np means no problem... ;)
2009-08-19T23:30:00.000Z	joep		minimec; OK. I have virtualbox running on another system without any problem but that's an AMD 64-bit 3000+ running hardy and a little bit too slow for what I want to do.
2009-08-19T23:31:00.000Z	minimec	joep	I have a AMD X2 5000+ running with Virtualbox. I did not change any defaults.
2009-08-19T23:31:00.000Z	joep	minimec	I have restarted the whole system Could it be the fact that I use a KVM-switch to toggle between 2 systems?
2009-08-19T23:33:00.000Z	minimec	joep	I don't think so.
2009-08-19T23:33:00.000Z	joep		storm: When I star vortualbox (AMD 4-core jaunty) the whole system freezes. No keyboard activity is possible. Only the mouse-pointer can be moved.
2009-08-19T23:35:00.000Z	joep	minimec	yes I thought so but it is a major problem as I want to use the system to run sevral programs on a.o. Windows (yes I know!!!) but some programs are only written for that OS.
2009-08-19T23:37:00.000Z	joep		storm: any ideas?
2009-08-19T23:37:00.000Z	minimec	joep	So your Virtualbox image freezes, when you start it with the configuration tool?
2009-08-19T23:39:00.000Z	joep	minimec	worse: I start simply from the Application Menu -> System Tools -> SUn Virtual Box.
2009-08-19T23:40:00.000Z	minimec	joep	Try to start it from a console once. That is strange... Maybe you get an error message. Did you search the net for that strange behaviour?
2009-08-19T23:41:00.000Z	joep	minimec	you mean a terminal in gnome or from F1?
2009-08-19T23:44:00.000Z	minimec	joep	You have to do it inside gnome. Well you risk another freeze, but maybe you get some error codes. Also check if there is some kind of log file in /home/<yourname>/.VirtualBox I don't know if VirtualBox does create some error logs.
2009-08-19T23:47:00.000Z	joep	minimec	no log but a Directory .Virtualbox with no logfile. I go and look in /var/,og. One moment...
2009-08-19T23:49:00.000Z	joep	minimec	I dont see any logfile related to Virtualbox but I haven't looked inside the files. I can try a grep in the directory.
2009-08-19T23:50:00.000Z	minimec	joep	I don't see a reason for VirtualBox to freeze at start... sorry.
