2010-07-07T04:29:00.000Z	newboon2age	feurig	if you find answers for your udev questions and put it in one forum question then call attention to it on #ubuntu-beginners-wiki we can create a community wiki page with it.
2010-07-07T04:31:00.000Z	feurig	newboon2age	 I am more concerned that the answeres that were working for avr development are now broken on 10.4.
2010-07-07T04:33:00.000Z	newboon2age	feurig	i see that over on the atmel website they say "Atmel recommends beginners to use Ubuntu Linux, available from www.ubuntu.com."  That leads me to think atmel might have some answers for you (and in turn for all of us).
2010-07-07T04:38:00.000Z	newboon2age	feurig	well remember you're asking an extremely specific and specialized question in a channel made of volunteers.  Probably no one else here right at the moment has experience with it.  However Atmel probably does use Ubuntu Lucid and so could probably give the answer.
2010-07-07T04:43:00.000Z	newboon2age	feurig	i did deal a little tiny bit with UDEV rules when using a USB palm USB cradle, so i know what UDEV rules are.  I wasn't successful using them in 10.04, but I found i didn't need them after all.
2010-07-07T04:44:00.000Z	newboon2age	feurig	sorry, that is pretty much the limit of my knowledge.
2010-07-07T04:48:00.000Z	newboon2age	feurig	i assume that is a sarcastic statement.
2010-07-07T04:49:00.000Z	newboon2age	feurig	does running it with sudo work?  (better than some other options)
2010-07-07T05:03:00.000Z	newboon2age	feurig	i know this isn't very satisfiying but I do see that Atmel has their support center at http://support.atmel.no/bin/customer  Since they are actively recommending Ubuntu chances are reasonable that someone there has figured this out...
2010-07-07T05:04:00.000Z	feurig	newboon2age	those people coundnt produce source code that compiled outside of the blessed platform for the avr32 platform for 2 years.
2010-07-07T05:05:00.000Z	newboon2age	feurig	sorry to hear that...
2010-07-07T05:10:00.000Z	newboon2age	feurig	here are a few other resources that might help.  Obviously forums.ubuntu.com.  also you can ask the developers at  https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+addquestion  OR
2010-07-07T05:14:00.000Z	newboon2age	feurig	purchasing canonical support isn't too expensive either.  Sometimes for really tough specifc questions i think it might be worth it.  For one year Â£ 104.21 http://shop.canonical.com/product_info.php?products_id=668
2010-07-07T05:15:00.000Z	newboon2age	feurig	when i think about the fact that's how much it would cost me just to buy winduhz, it kinda puts it in perspective...
2010-07-07T05:16:00.000Z	feurig	newboon2age	thanks

2010-07-07T05:23:00.000Z	newboon2age	feurig	A comment on this blog seems to indicate some of the major changes actually came for 9.04  http://fredericiana.com/2010/05/28/udevinfo-on-ubuntu-10-4-lucid/
2010-07-07T05:26:00.000Z	newboon2age	feurig	This bug shows some workarounds in this is what the issue is : https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/569645
2010-07-07T05:30:00.000Z	newboon2age	feurig	btw, you realize that Lucid no longer includes HAL by default, right?  So somethings work different because of that, and somethings that were working on previous editions can be returned to working by installing HAL.
