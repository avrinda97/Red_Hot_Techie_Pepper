2011-01-25T02:12:00.000Z	warrenachild		and I have it routed to my IP address
2011-01-25T02:12:00.000Z	warrenachild		I have a website hosted as well, and I got that working fine
2011-01-25T02:12:00.000Z	warrenachild		I am not familier with dx
2011-01-25T02:12:00.000Z	warrenachild		mx
2011-01-25T02:12:00.000Z	warrenachild		I mean but DNS works
2011-01-25T02:13:00.000Z	warrenachild		never herd of it
2011-01-25T02:13:00.000Z	warrenachild		lol like I said I am a complete noob
2011-01-25T02:13:00.000Z	warrenachild		well, at e-mail server n e ways
2011-01-25T02:14:00.000Z	warrenachild		I am going though a free web routing company
2011-01-25T02:14:00.000Z	mbeierl	warrenachild	there is a set of instructions on how to set up postfix from the ubuntu community here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Postfix  Once you get your dns, etc, sorted, that a look there
2011-01-25T02:17:00.000Z	mbeierl	warrenachild	there is a big difference between a web host that forwards your IP address and an actual DNS entry.  When you type in "host yourhostnamehere.com" does it give you your IP address or the address of the routing company?
2011-01-25T02:17:00.000Z	mbeierl	warrenachild	where "yourhostnamehere.com" is your actual host name, of course :)
2011-01-25T02:18:00.000Z	warrenachild	mbeierl	good question I have never looked
2011-01-25T02:18:00.000Z	mbeierl	warrenachild	I should also mention that a lot of internet service providers frown upon you running your own email server.  It is also a real pain to keep yourself up to date with anti-spam etc.  I long ago gave up hosting my own email server as it was just a huge drain
2011-01-25T02:19:00.000Z	warrenachild	mbeierl	it is all for learning and experiance. I might have to do it for a business some day
2011-01-25T02:20:00.000Z	mbeierl	warrenachild	ok.  Just as long as you are aware of all the headaches that can come long too.  You also need to be aware of security risks and make sure you don't accidentally become a mail relay and get used for sending out spam for someone else
2011-01-25T02:21:00.000Z	mbeierl	warrenachild	I should also mention that postfix is just the delivery side.  Dovecot is the name of the software that provides the ability to serve up mail as IMAP or POP3.

2011-01-25T02:22:00.000Z	warrenachild	mbeierl	okay so is the mx record local or is it external like DNS?
2011-01-25T02:23:00.000Z	mbeierl	warrenachild	it must be external and in DNS or mail cannot get to you from the outside world.
