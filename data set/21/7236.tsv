2006-12-21T11:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	max_	If you have beryl set up then kiba-dock
2006-12-21T11:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	max_	I havn't tried it myself but these instructions might help for getting kiba-dock ( I compiled from source ) http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=307521
2006-12-21T11:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	max_	kiba-dock is much more than just an OSx dock though ( it has a physics engine and many effects ) and a simpler dock might be easier to install.
2006-12-21T11:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	max_	Depends on what you want exactly, you get get a simple OS x like dock just by changing the preferences in your current gnome-panel even
2006-12-21T11:18:00.000Z	max_	Jordan_U	im KDE
2006-12-21T11:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	max_	I don't know then, try #kubuntu
2008-05-19T07:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	max_	You can use > 4 GIG of RAM with the 32 bit server kernel
2008-05-19T07:54:00.000Z	max_	Jordan_U	I can use more than 4gb ram with 32bit kernel?
2008-05-19T07:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	max_	With the -server kernel instead of -generic, yes
2008-05-19T07:55:00.000Z	max_	Jordan_U	AH!   I'm using generic.
2010-04-16T10:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	max_	Why do you want 7.04?
2010-04-16T10:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	max_	Just so that you understand that there are many *known* and serious security vulnerabilities in 7.04...
2010-04-16T10:05:00.000Z	max_	Jordan_U	ya I know thats why I'm getting it
2010-04-16T10:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	max_	old-releases.ubuntu.com, please don't use it on a computer with data you care about.
2010-04-16T10:06:00.000Z	max_	Jordan_U	ya I know of course I went there first but the link is broken
