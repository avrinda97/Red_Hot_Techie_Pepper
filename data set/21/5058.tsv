2008-01-10T00:03:00.000Z	DRebellion		guess its time for google then ;)
2008-01-10T00:04:00.000Z	xomp	DRebellion	this site appears to be for gaming purposes. Is this still relevant to what I'm trying to accomplish for work?
2008-01-21T22:52:00.000Z	DRebellion	xomp	metacity is a windows manager. i don't think ubuntu uses it.
2008-01-21T22:53:00.000Z	xomp	DRebellion	ok, thanks. Do you know which of the many choices on this website I would need to browse then? I don't want to run emerald or any other thing like that to slow things down.
2008-01-21T22:53:00.000Z	DRebellion	xomp	sorry, i was wrong. ubuntu uses it as part of gnome. thanks for clearing that up MrObvious
2008-01-21T22:54:00.000Z	xomp	DRebellion	and Mr. O thanks :)
2008-02-02T22:37:00.000Z	xomp	DRebellion	mucho gracias :)
2008-02-02T22:45:00.000Z	xomp	DRebellion	I installed Istanbul and recorded a session, but when I play it back the player (I think totem) opens then immediately closes without playing the file.. Any suggestions?
2008-02-02T22:46:00.000Z	DRebellion	xomp	what type of file is it?
2008-02-02T22:46:00.000Z	xomp	DRebellion	video/x-theora+ogg
2008-02-02T22:47:00.000Z	DRebellion	xomp	hmm, i've never used istanbul before so i can't really comment.
2008-02-02T22:48:00.000Z	xomp	DRebellion	okey, I've never messed with my media player before, it's the stock media player that comes with Gnome/Ubuntu, not sure if there's a ton of work to do too it before you can actually use it.
2008-02-02T22:48:00.000Z	DRebellion	xomp	there shouldn't be for ogg
2008-02-02T22:52:00.000Z	xomp	DRebellion	anything I play back in totem just displays a green screen. The progress bar goes along just fine but there's just a static green screen in the app itself. Any idea what may cause that?
2008-02-02T22:53:00.000Z	DRebellion	xomp	no, sorry.
2008-02-02T22:53:00.000Z	DRebellion	xomp	i recommend mplayer for playing anything
2008-02-02T22:53:00.000Z	xomp	DRebellion	thanks, I'll give that a try
2008-02-02T23:04:00.000Z	xomp	DRebellion	I get a message about "Can't open codec" when trying to play an .ogg video file in Mplayer.
2008-02-03T05:31:00.000Z	DRebellion	xomp	hrm that file works ootb for me with only mplayer installed :/
