2009-04-06T05:48:00.000Z	crdlb	UbuntuStudent	why not just install nvidia-glx-71 ?
2009-04-06T05:48:00.000Z	UbuntuStudent	crdlb	never knew about that lol
2009-04-06T05:58:00.000Z	crdlb	UbuntuStudent	gah, use the package
2009-04-06T05:58:00.000Z	UbuntuStudent	crdlb	How? Do i need to do all this? and is it safe? :)
2009-04-06T05:58:00.000Z	crdlb	UbuntuStudent	not remotely :)
2009-04-06T05:58:00.000Z	crdlb	UbuntuStudent	first of all, did you look in System > Administration > Hardware Drivers?
2009-04-06T05:59:00.000Z	UbuntuStudent	crdlb	no
2009-04-06T06:01:00.000Z	crdlb	UbuntuStudent	and there are no available choices?
2009-04-06T06:01:00.000Z	UbuntuStudent	crdlb	Nope
2009-04-06T06:02:00.000Z	crdlb	UbuntuStudent	is nvidia-71-modaliases installed?
2009-04-06T06:02:00.000Z	UbuntuStudent	crdlb	Yes
2009-04-06T06:02:00.000Z	crdlb	UbuntuStudent	then I guess you can 'sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-71' manually
2009-04-06T06:03:00.000Z	UbuntuStudent	crdlb	Use Terminal? Or the way scunizi is saying?
2009-04-06T06:03:00.000Z	crdlb	UbuntuStudent	it doesn't matter, as long as you install the package
2009-04-06T06:04:00.000Z	UbuntuStudent	crdlb	i thnk ill do it the Terminal way, it is 100% safe correct?
2009-04-06T06:04:00.000Z	crdlb	UbuntuStudent	it can always be undone, and even if it fails, the failsafe GUI will kick in
