2005-01-08T09:06:00.000Z	ogra	supertux_	do you see it in device manager ?
2005-01-08T09:07:00.000Z	ogra	supertux_	do you see the disk below ?
2005-01-08T09:08:00.000Z	ogra	supertux_	try plugging out and in again
2005-01-08T09:08:00.000Z	supertux_	ogra	i tried that
2005-01-08T09:09:00.000Z	ogra	supertux_	hmm, it should....
2005-01-08T09:10:00.000Z	ogra	supertux_	if you see the disk, can you look at the advanced tab ? the first entry should be the device
2005-01-08T09:10:00.000Z	supertux_	ogra	i think the problem is that it doesnt know its capabilities
2005-01-08T09:10:00.000Z	ogra	supertux_	you are on warty ?
2005-01-08T09:11:00.000Z	ogra	supertux_	then it should simply work... look for the device entry in the advanced tab
2005-01-08T09:12:00.000Z	supertux_	ogra	there is no usb.device
2005-01-08T09:13:00.000Z	ogra	supertux_	we are looking for an /dev/something
2005-01-08T09:13:00.000Z	ogra	supertux_	its always the first entry
2005-01-08T09:13:00.000Z	ogra	supertux_	if you see the disk and its partitions its on the disk branch
2005-01-08T09:14:00.000Z	ogra	supertux_	the entry is called block.device
2005-01-08T09:15:00.000Z	supertux_	ogra	nothing with block on it
2005-01-08T09:15:00.000Z	ogra	supertux_	very bad
