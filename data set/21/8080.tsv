2007-10-24T20:25:00.000Z	stefg	jacquesmerde	are you using a vga=foobar boot parameter for a fb-conole? These are broken in gutsy
2007-10-24T20:25:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	stefg	yeah. i had to to get the splash boot parameter working
2007-10-24T20:26:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	stefg	was that unnecessary?
2007-10-24T20:26:00.000Z	stefg	jacquesmerde	refrain from using any vga= bootparameter. fbcon
2007-10-24T20:27:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	stefg	then my monitor goes blank between grub and loading X
2007-10-24T20:27:00.000Z	stefg	jacquesmerde	it's an annoying stupid misconfiguration of fbcon which didn't get fixed for release
2007-10-24T20:28:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	stefg	what is? that i had to use a vga= parameter to get a splash? or that said parameter fubar fbcons?
2007-10-24T20:28:00.000Z	stefg	jacquesmerde	no, don't use any vga parameters. just plain 40x25 text console
2007-10-24T20:31:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	stefg	there's a break down in communication here. what bug are you referring to?
2007-10-24T20:33:00.000Z	stefg	jacquesmerde	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/initramfs-tools/+bug/129910
2007-10-24T20:35:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	stefg	ah. thing is, i have vga= as a boot parameter as a fix for ANOTHER bug
2007-10-24T20:36:00.000Z	stefg	jacquesmerde	lol .... running in circles. it would be funny if it had not such bad consquences. time for ubuntu to start to fix a couple of bugs it seems
2007-10-24T20:50:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	stefg	circles in deed. there's a hope in my bucket, dear liza
2007-10-24T20:51:00.000Z	stefg	jacquesmerde	yeah... sad situation. i find myself looking on debian, pclos, and freebsd since gutsy release . This is no longer a professional distro
2007-10-24T20:52:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	stefg	surely these bugs were reported before the final gutsy release!
2007-10-24T20:53:00.000Z	stefg	jacquesmerde	just look at the tty bug. reported on tribe5, marked as critical, milestoned for beta. What happened? Nothing!
2007-10-24T20:55:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	stefg	my bug was dangerous for new users though. i kept trying to boot into ubuntu, being greeted with my screen turning blank, so restarting the computer. took me a LONG time to realise i could wait a number of seconds and wait for X to load up
2007-10-24T20:56:00.000Z	stefg	jacquesmerde	that implies that anyone would care for that.
2007-10-24T20:58:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	stefg	care for what?
2007-10-24T21:00:00.000Z	stefg	jacquesmerde	care for real user experience beyond the hype. But we are getting offtopic. More disappointment with ubuntu in #ubuntu-offtopic, if you feel like loaing off some frustration
2007-10-24T21:00:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	stefg	i'm not looking for perfection. i've already found my perfect distro (arch). i'm just exploring ubuntu, and enjoying it
