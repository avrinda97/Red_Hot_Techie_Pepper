2011-11-29T02:23:00.000Z	TeamFDcoAdmin		Hello. I recently upgraded Ubuntu 10.04 to 10.10. Now i have a lot of boot enteries in the grub2 boot loader and when i boit some kernels the PC freezes after some minutes.. can i remove the old kernels? If yes, how. Thanx.
2011-11-29T02:24:00.000Z	guntbert	TeamFDcoAdmin	use your favourite software manager to remove them
2011-11-29T02:24:00.000Z	TeamFDcoAdmin	guntbert	Can I use synaptic package manager? Can it damage my system...?
2011-11-29T02:25:00.000Z	guntbert	TeamFDcoAdmin	yes you can use synaptic, and no it will not damage your system, if you only remove old kernels
2011-11-29T02:26:00.000Z	TeamFDcoAdmin	guntbert	Oh okay thanks for yer help.
2011-11-29T02:26:00.000Z	guntbert	TeamFDcoAdmin	in synaptic do a "quicksearch" for linux-image, then remove the oldest entries
2011-11-29T02:27:00.000Z	TeamFDcoAdmin	guntbert	it also created a second entery for windows 7 how can i remove this one?
2011-11-29T02:28:00.000Z	guntbert	TeamFDcoAdmin	not sure here, sorry
2011-11-29T02:28:00.000Z	TeamFDcoAdmin	guntbert	okay i think ill manage to edit the grub config file but thank you for your help with the kernels.
2011-11-29T02:29:00.000Z	guntbert	TeamFDcoAdmin	you're welcome :-) do you have grub1 or grub2?
2011-11-29T02:29:00.000Z	TeamFDcoAdmin	guntbert	grub2
2011-11-29T02:30:00.000Z	TeamFDcoAdmin	guntbert	Oh nevermind about the Windows 7 thing i found this app called Grub customizer to edit the enteries of grub2 or BURG... i think that worked.
2011-11-29T02:31:00.000Z	guntbert	TeamFDcoAdmin	then editing /boot/grub/grub.conf  is not really adviseable; changes are made to /etc/default/grub
2011-11-29T02:31:00.000Z	TeamFDcoAdmin	guntbert	Yep. That solved my problem...
2011-11-29T02:32:00.000Z	TeamFDcoAdmin	guntbert	Thanks anyway.
2011-11-29T02:32:00.000Z	guntbert	TeamFDcoAdmin	:)
2011-12-02T02:30:00.000Z	guntbert	TeamFDcoAdmin	the way will be 10.10->11.04->11.10
2011-12-02T02:31:00.000Z	TeamFDcoAdmin	guntbert	yes, i know but could it harm my system i i upgrade?
2011-12-02T02:31:00.000Z	guntbert	TeamFDcoAdmin	in my experience not, but you see opinions differ - in any case you should back up your data first
2011-12-02T02:32:00.000Z	TeamFDcoAdmin	guntbert	okay im gonna upgrade as soon as i backed up my data thanks for your answer
2011-12-02T02:32:00.000Z	guntbert	TeamFDcoAdmin	Good luck :-)
