2006-11-19T13:16:00.000Z	talkIRC		ok i've read alot but still have no idea why i can't get this smartlink 1800 pci modem to read
2006-11-19T13:17:00.000Z	talkIRC		could i set up a direct connection to my windows nic and use the dial up from it to try to post the problem to ubuntu servers for help?
2006-11-19T13:18:00.000Z	talkIRC		or am i just wasting my time trying to get online with it until broadband is an option in my area in 2009?
2006-11-19T13:19:00.000Z	talkIRC		dial-up is my only option
2006-11-19T13:20:00.000Z	talkIRC		100 US dollars a month for the cheepest one i can find, that's just too far out of my price range
2006-11-19T13:21:00.000Z	talkIRC		so the bottem line is that i'm pretty well "s.o.l." if all i can use is dial-up
2006-11-19T13:22:00.000Z	talkIRC		read that, didn't help me any, didn't even offer my modem chipset anywhere with all that
2006-11-19T13:23:00.000Z	talkIRC		and i have like 3 conexant modems but i'm trying to use linux to get away from paying for software, drivers, ect.  ; the only place to get drivers for those modems wants to charge you for them, and i can't see doing that with something that's open sorce
2006-11-19T13:23:00.000Z	roryy	talkIRC	have you downloaded and run the 'scanModem' script ?
2006-11-19T13:25:00.000Z	roryy	talkIRC	hmm, ok, that's not good
2006-11-19T13:26:00.000Z	roryy	talkIRC	if scanModem crashes, I'd recommend mailing the linmodem mailing list
2006-11-19T13:29:00.000Z	talkIRC	roryy	i'll try scanmodem again and see what happens, maybe i messed it up somewhere
2006-11-19T13:29:00.000Z	roryy	talkIRC	hmm. maybe
2006-11-19T13:29:00.000Z	roryy	talkIRC	unfortunately, these win modems are a major pain.  I have one myself
2006-11-19T13:29:00.000Z	roryy	talkIRC	it makes every kernel upgrade and adventure!
2006-11-19T13:32:00.000Z	roryy	talkIRC	yes, it does.  I have an intel 536ep
2006-11-19T13:48:00.000Z	roryy	talkIRC	it should be
2006-11-19T13:48:00.000Z	roryy	talkIRC	offhand, I can't remember which one
2006-11-19T13:49:00.000Z	roryy	talkIRC	although it's very thorough, i do find scanModem's output to be a little verbose
2006-11-19T13:49:00.000Z	talkIRC	roryy	any help is better then none
2006-11-19T14:15:00.000Z	talkIRC	roryy	thanks for all the help so far, i'll be back if i need more
