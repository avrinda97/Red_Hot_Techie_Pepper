2006-07-19T09:07:00.000Z	Shak-	richiefrich	err, I want ultraedit? :/
2006-07-19T09:07:00.000Z	richiefrich	Shak-	 but u need  to extract a .dll?
2006-07-19T09:07:00.000Z	Shak-	richiefrich	thats the setup doing that
2006-07-19T09:09:00.000Z	richiefrich	Shak-	 o.O   maybe it's lookin for that  .dll  do u have all the .dll files  from a windows CD or u can get them from http://www.dll-files.com/
2006-07-19T09:10:00.000Z	Shak-	richiefrich	my bad, I was doing it without sudo
2006-07-19T09:10:00.000Z	richiefrich	Shak-	do'h
2006-07-19T09:16:00.000Z	Shak-	richiefrich	hmm all installed now, but it crashes as soon as I run it
2006-07-19T09:17:00.000Z	Shak-	richiefrich	no wait, it'll run as root but not as a regular user
2006-07-19T09:17:00.000Z	richiefrich	Shak-	it shouldnt matter
2006-07-19T09:18:00.000Z	Shak-	richiefrich	its odd, it opens fine as root, but then crashes as soon as I open it without sudo
2006-07-19T09:19:00.000Z	richiefrich	Shak-	so it works with   root ?
2006-07-19T09:19:00.000Z	Shak-	richiefrich	yep
2006-07-19T09:20:00.000Z	richiefrich	Shak-	how strange..
2006-07-19T09:20:00.000Z	Shak-	richiefrich	roger that
2006-07-19T09:34:00.000Z	Shak-	richiefrich	ok I managed to get it to work, im trying to work on the file associations now, I set one extension (.php) to open with wine /path/to/uedit32.exe, but the loading fails in the actual program
2006-07-19T09:37:00.000Z	richiefrich	Shak-	hmm u mean in the    windows app it fails?
2006-07-19T09:38:00.000Z	Shak-	richiefrich	yep, its weird, the path it sees is H:\ome\shak\file.php (its the typo thats causing it to fail)
