2007-12-02T07:25:00.000Z	Highlife		Hey guys I'm not getting any audio out of vlc or mplayer
2007-12-02T07:27:00.000Z	kelsin	Highlife	it's a stupid question but is the volume up on everything needed? (Right click on the speaker in the system tray and click "Open Volume Control") and make sure stuff isn't muted, low volume
2007-12-02T07:27:00.000Z	Highlife	kelsin	yes it is
2007-12-02T07:28:00.000Z	kelsin	Highlife	sound works in most other programs?
2007-12-02T07:29:00.000Z	kelsin	Highlife	did you install the vlc-plugin-alsa package?
2007-12-02T07:29:00.000Z	Highlife	kelsin	let me check
2007-12-02T07:31:00.000Z	Highlife	kelsin	its installed now but I'm still not getting sound
2007-12-02T07:31:00.000Z	kelsin	Highlife	make sure to check in the vlc preferences and try all of the output modules to see if any work
2007-12-02T07:32:00.000Z	kelsin	Highlife	( and to make sure sound is enabled in the audio general settings)
2007-12-02T07:34:00.000Z	Highlife	kelsin	nun of the modules are working
2007-12-02T07:35:00.000Z	kelsin	Highlife	if you run vlc from the command line do any errors come up when trying to play movies related to the sound?
2007-12-02T07:35:00.000Z	kelsin	Highlife	pastebin any errors you get
2007-12-02T07:37:00.000Z	kelsin	Highlife	sorry, lost the convo for a sec, with the alsa module selected do you get that same error? The "oss audio output error"?
2007-12-02T07:37:00.000Z	Highlife	kelsin	yes i do
2007-12-02T07:38:00.000Z	kelsin	Highlife	can you try selecting differen devices under Audio / Output / Alsa (might have to click the refresh list to make them appear)
2007-12-02T07:39:00.000Z	kelsin	Highlife	also on the "Output modules" screen, amke sure to click Advanced Options and set the audio output module to "Alsa"
2007-12-02T07:42:00.000Z	Highlife	kelsin	Alright I have the Advance options box checked and ALSA audio output selected I also have the HDa Intel: STAC92xx Digital device selected in AlSA Device name
2007-12-02T07:43:00.000Z	kelsin	Highlife	if you still get the /dev/dsp error when you try to play sound that's very odd, since that's a oss error
2007-12-02T07:44:00.000Z	Highlife	kelsin	I'm not getting any errors any mroe
2007-12-02T07:45:00.000Z	kelsin	Highlife	any messages in /var/log/messages or /var/log/syslog?
2007-12-02T07:46:00.000Z	Highlife	kelsin	no
