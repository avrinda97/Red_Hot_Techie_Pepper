2007-02-04T12:47:00.000Z	padge		How do you shut down gnome and the X server?
2007-02-04T12:48:00.000Z	ardchoille	padge	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
2007-02-04T12:49:00.000Z	ardchoille	padge	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop  is the proper way to do it.
2007-02-04T12:49:00.000Z	padge	ardchoille	thanks
2007-02-08T17:57:00.000Z	ardchoille	padge	I'm sure someone can try.
2007-02-17T09:05:00.000Z	padge	ardchoille	Never heard of it.  Checking...
2007-02-17T09:38:00.000Z	ardchoille	padge	Always best to keep at least two kernels. There was recently a kernel problem in Dapper that  wouldn't allow us to upgrade and fix something that went wrong in the kernel package.
2007-02-17T09:39:00.000Z	padge	ardchoille	I will keep the next most recent kernel then.  But I also want to move other options... Well, I used to want to put Windows XP at the top of the list, but now I really don't :)  However, I do want to change the timeout settings and stuff like that
2007-02-17T09:40:00.000Z	ardchoille	padge	Yeah, I made some changes to mine too.
2007-02-17T09:42:00.000Z	ardchoille	padge	I'm not a good one to help with that because I have always just let the pm handle the kernel.
2007-02-17T09:45:00.000Z	ardchoille	padge	I use Ubuntu on a PII
2007-02-17T09:45:00.000Z	padge	ardchoille	You've got 686 instructions then
2007-02-17T09:45:00.000Z	ardchoille	padge	Yes
2007-02-17T11:09:00.000Z	ardchoille	padge	Maggie says have a look in ~/.bashrc (look for .bash_aliases)
2007-02-17T11:09:00.000Z	padge	ardchoille	thanks
2007-02-17T11:11:00.000Z	padge	ardchoille	I'm wanting to set an alias for all users and all terminals, including the real ones
2007-02-17T11:11:00.000Z	ardchoille	padge	What do yo mean? When someone types a command it executes something else?
2007-02-17T11:11:00.000Z	padge	ardchoille	Yes, when someone types 'dir' I want it to execute 'ls -l'
2007-02-17T11:12:00.000Z	ardchoille	padge	create the file ~/.bash_aliases and put this in it: alias dir='ls -l'
2007-02-17T11:13:00.000Z	padge	ardchoille	Wouldn't that make it only for my user?
2007-02-17T11:13:00.000Z	ardchoille	padge	Well, yes, you'd need to do that for each user.
