2008-04-16T06:33:00.000Z	fish	JPSman	ok, one moment

2008-04-16T06:42:00.000Z	fish	JPSman	in the create launcher dialog, are you selecting "Aplication" or "Aplication in terminal"?
2008-04-16T06:43:00.000Z	JPSman	fish	it needs a text file to start it running

2008-04-16T06:49:00.000Z	fish	JPSman	I am afraid I cannot answer you question. I am sorry but I dont know the answer and I was unable to find it. Perhaps someone else here my know how JPSman can create a launcher for the program "Phun" without getting the error: "there was an error creating a child process for this terminal" ?
2008-04-16T06:51:00.000Z	fish	JPSman	No Problem, Again, I am sorry that i was unable to help.
2008-04-16T11:03:00.000Z	fish	JPSman	did you get you issue resolved?
2008-04-16T11:04:00.000Z	fish	JPSman	Man, I am sorry about that. I guess it was a tougher question than I first thought
2008-04-16T11:04:00.000Z	fish	JPSman	but did you get the launcher created?
2008-04-16T11:04:00.000Z	JPSman	fish	I have to run a text file for it to point to the .bin   This is what the text file says    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=".:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}" ./phun.bin $@
