2005-11-03T07:22:00.000Z	stevenj		Is anyone getting .xsession-errors after a breezy (clean) install?
2005-11-03T07:23:00.000Z	Oarnta	stevenj	what driver did you use for xserver?
2005-11-03T07:23:00.000Z	stevenj	Oarnta	its makes no difference if I use nv or (ubuntu) Nvidia
2005-11-03T07:23:00.000Z	Oarnta	stevenj	what video card do you have?
2005-11-03T07:24:00.000Z	stevenj	Oarnta	this is my post on ubuntu forums (I have a geforce 5200) http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=83486
2005-11-03T07:25:00.000Z	Oarnta	stevenj	have you tried using the vesa driver instead of the nvidia specific one, just to see if it works that way?
2005-11-03T07:25:00.000Z	Oarnta	stevenj	you won't get any acceleration, but that might help diagnose
2005-11-03T07:26:00.000Z	stevenj	Oarnta	that is (I assume) the default driver after a fresh install and checked 3 times the xsession-errors before anything
2005-11-03T07:27:00.000Z	Oarnta	stevenj	Have ya tried a different video card?
2005-11-03T07:28:00.000Z	stevenj	Oarnta	I have not...it worked with hoary I think....have you ever seen this before?
2005-11-03T07:29:00.000Z	Oarnta	stevenj	try "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2005-11-03T07:29:00.000Z	Oarnta	stevenj	and select the vesa driver specifically.
2005-11-03T07:31:00.000Z	stevenj	Oarnta	the thing is with nvidia glx installed I can run glxgears fine with 3K fps and I'm logging in fine and getting on the net fine...I just dont understand what I means
2005-11-03T07:33:00.000Z	Oarnta	stevenj	so it works fine, just gives an error that doesn't seem to come from a problem that affects you
2005-11-03T07:34:00.000Z	stevenj	Oarnta	well true...I am just curious as to what it means
2005-11-03T07:35:00.000Z	Oarnta	stevenj	I honestly have no clue, I'm not sure
2005-11-03T07:35:00.000Z	stevenj	Oarnta	thanks
2005-11-03T07:35:00.000Z	Oarnta	stevenj	sorry I coudn't help more
2005-11-03T07:36:00.000Z	stevenj	Oarnta	thanks for the alt suggestions...I can't find anyone who knows what it means..no one
2005-11-03T07:36:00.000Z	Oarnta	stevenj	UTSL... (google if it you must)
2005-11-03T07:37:00.000Z	stevenj	Oarnta	oh I spend hours today at work..I found references on the ubuntu bugs and some others, but no one knows what it means
