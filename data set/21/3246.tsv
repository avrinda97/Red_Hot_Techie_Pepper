2009-02-17T04:56:00.000Z	marqueed		i guess this isn't strictly ubuntu - but how could i strip out the \n \l from /etc/issue? and what are they there for anyway, when there's a real newline
2009-02-17T04:56:00.000Z	Ne0n_Lightz	marqueed	what makes you think this isnt strictly ubuntu lol?
2009-02-17T04:57:00.000Z	marqueed	Ne0n_Lightz	i'm really looking for how to use sed/tr correctly, b/c i'm having problems
2009-02-17T04:57:00.000Z	Ne0n_Lightz	marqueed	oh. well you said you guess this isnt strict ubuntu like someone asked about windows
2009-02-17T04:59:00.000Z	marqueed	Ne0n_Lightz	whatis your card?
2009-02-17T05:00:00.000Z	marqueed	Ne0n_Lightz	i'm pretty sure both do
2009-02-17T05:00:00.000Z	marqueed	Ne0n_Lightz	google it

2009-02-17T05:01:00.000Z	marqueed	Ne0n_Lightz	i'm pretty sure both do
2009-02-17T05:01:00.000Z	marqueed	Ne0n_Lightz	why so many dots?
2009-02-17T05:02:00.000Z	Ne0n_Lightz	marqueed	because thats the cool meter for myself. as you can see, im quite cool.

2009-02-17T05:02:00.000Z	marqueed	Ne0n_Lightz	so it sounds like the 9300 has 3D, 8300 doesn't
2009-02-17T05:03:00.000Z	Ne0n_Lightz	marqueed	im just worried about that drivers.. in the past, when i install them, i cant get gui after reboot.
2009-02-17T05:03:00.000Z	marqueed	Ne0n_Lightz	give it a try on live cd
2009-02-17T05:03:00.000Z	marqueed	Ne0n_Lightz	i thought you meant Radeon 9300/8300?
2009-02-17T05:03:00.000Z	marqueed	Ne0n_Lightz	do you mean an Inspiron?
2009-02-17T05:04:00.000Z	marqueed	Ne0n_Lightz	oops, you'd already said nvidia i guess
2009-02-17T05:05:00.000Z	marqueed	Ne0n_Lightz	it *should* work, try a livecd first to check on it, you'll need to add the restricted drivers
2009-02-17T05:05:00.000Z	Ne0n_Lightz	marqueed	so i can test it on the livecd? i didnt know that
2009-02-17T05:07:00.000Z	marqueed	Ne0n_Lightz	sure, what i try to do unless there's an unequivocal answer on the forums or something regarding supported hardware is try it out in a store with a livecd, as a tip
