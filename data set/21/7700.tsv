2006-09-05T15:39:00.000Z	mistform		WTF did I type wrong???
2006-09-05T15:39:00.000Z	mistform		i couldn't manually type it, so I copied it from the ubuntu guide and it was this: sudo apt-get install sun-java5-jre sun-java5-plugin
2006-09-05T15:40:00.000Z	mistform		but I still fail to see wtf I did wrong
2006-09-05T15:40:00.000Z	mistform		seriously
2006-09-05T15:40:00.000Z	mistform		it's pissing me off to no ends
2006-09-05T15:40:00.000Z	mistform		I've already reformatted because of I/O erros and BS like that earlier today
2006-09-05T15:40:00.000Z	mistform		TWICE today
2006-09-05T15:40:00.000Z	mistform		it was just Dapper TLS
2006-09-05T15:40:00.000Z	mistform		so I obviously typed something wrong
2006-09-05T15:41:00.000Z	mistform		delete it
2006-09-05T15:41:00.000Z	mathieu	mistform	is that for me?
2006-09-05T15:42:00.000Z	mistform	mathieu	what exactly do you mean by "appearing on my desktop?"?
2006-09-05T15:42:00.000Z	mistform	mathieu	is there a link to Network Places on your desktop?
2006-09-05T15:43:00.000Z	mathieu	mistform	when i "connect to a server", i get an icon for every "connection" an my desktop
2006-09-05T15:43:00.000Z	mistform	mathieu	an icon near your time/date?
2006-09-05T15:43:00.000Z	mathieu	mistform	no, just on the desktop
2006-09-05T15:44:00.000Z	mathieu	mistform	like a samba share, an ftp account etc..
2006-09-05T15:44:00.000Z	mathieu	mistform	i can't delete those icons, only disconnect
2006-09-05T15:44:00.000Z	mistform	mathieu	I thought it was something simple, but I guess not. maybe right click it and see if you can change some sort of settings
2006-09-05T15:45:00.000Z	mathieu	mistform	nope, i would ask if it were that simple
2006-09-05T15:46:00.000Z	mistform	mathieu	you know more about Linux than I do, I was just trying to see if I could help with something simple
