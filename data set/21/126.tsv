2012-08-19T21:46:00.000Z	ebbers	ActionParsnip	I've tried both the apt-get update and upgrade as well as software updates and I don't think they operate exactly the same. What do you think?
2012-08-19T21:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ebbers	they achieve the same end
2012-08-19T21:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ebbers	you just get to see what is going on, plus any errors will be shown. The GUI apps don't really show that
2012-08-19T21:47:00.000Z	ebbers	ActionParsnip	I've noticed a big difference when loading systems if I use apt-get verses software update. What I notice is that the software update seems to not work in the same order as it would if I didn't uses aopt-get
2012-08-19T21:48:00.000Z	ebbers	ActionParsnip	Meaning I end up with a different system load based on which style i choose
2012-08-19T21:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ebbers	do you mean load as in CPU usage?
2012-08-19T21:49:00.000Z	ebbers	ActionParsnip	This is just one thing I've noticed over the years. No I mean a different set of packages and updates
2012-08-19T21:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ebbers	the packages and deps are identical, so the same packages will be updated and installed
2012-08-19T21:51:00.000Z	ebbers	ActionParsnip	The system performs differently based on the procedure. I tend to stick with software updates until they are complete then I use apt-get
2012-08-19T21:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ebbers	the required packages are read for each package and satisfied
2012-08-19T21:51:00.000Z	ebbers	ActionParsnip	Why inconsistency then?
2012-08-19T21:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ebbers	i'm very sure its identical, otherwise you would gen an inconsistant package state if deps are not all met
2012-08-19T21:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ebbers	itd be a massive bug and would have been sorted ages ago as it is a fundamental foundation of the OS
2012-08-19T21:53:00.000Z	ebbers	ActionParsnip	So you are saying that software update does the exact same thing in the exact same order as apt-get update and upgrade?
2012-08-19T21:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ebbers	yes, its just a pretty GUI,some insall the recommended packages, others don't but they will definately install what is needed for the application to run as expected
2012-08-19T21:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ebbers	where have you heard this from?
2012-08-19T21:55:00.000Z	ebbers	ActionParsnip	Its been my experience I've loading ubuntu since version 6
2012-08-19T21:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ebbers	there is no version 6, there is 6.06 and 6.10
2012-08-19T21:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ebbers	I've used ubuntu since Gutsy (7.10)
2012-08-19T21:57:00.000Z	ebbers	ActionParsnip	I've loaded Ubuntu 500 +/-. I just noticed this again and again sometimes more than others but definately noticed that the order matters.
2012-08-19T21:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ebbers	then I suggest you report a bug
