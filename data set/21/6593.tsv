2007-03-06T10:34:00.000Z	panfist		hey, im not sure if this is the best place to ask this question, but i'd like to be able to use VMware to run windows within ubuntu and vice versa...there are plenty of guides explaining how to run .iso files in vmware, or existing windows installs in ubuntu, but how can i convert an existing ubuntu install to run in vmware in windows?
2007-03-06T10:35:00.000Z	thoreauputic	panfist	google  easyvmx
2007-03-06T10:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	panfist	you're welcome :)
2007-03-06T10:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	panfist	search the ubuntu wiki too - there are pages about vmware etc
2007-03-06T10:46:00.000Z	panfist	thoreauputic	i dont know if im overlooking something really simple but i dont see a way to convert my existing ubuntu install into a VM
2007-03-06T10:46:00.000Z	thoreauputic	panfist	you need to make an image to run in vmware
2007-03-06T10:47:00.000Z	thoreauputic	panfist	you can install ubuntu into a vmplayer image
2007-03-06T10:47:00.000Z	panfist	thoreauputic	i have ubuntu installed that ive been using for a while configured how i like it which i would like to convert into a virtual machine
2007-03-06T10:47:00.000Z	thoreauputic	panfist	the easy vmx thing just supplies a virtual machine config
2007-03-06T10:47:00.000Z	panfist	thoreauputic	or do i have to start over
2007-03-06T10:47:00.000Z	panfist	thoreauputic	ahhh
2007-03-06T10:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic	panfist	I have only used vmware with installs made in vmware
2007-03-06T10:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic	panfist	ie. i installed ubuntu into a vmdk or whatever they call it
2007-03-06T10:48:00.000Z	panfist	thoreauputic	i'm almost as much of a vmware noob as i am a linux noob so forgive me if i need things spelled out..i think im going to do some more research before i try to do this task
2007-03-06T10:49:00.000Z	thoreauputic	panfist	have you checked the wiki?
2007-03-06T10:50:00.000Z	panfist	thoreauputic	which wiki is "the" wiki
