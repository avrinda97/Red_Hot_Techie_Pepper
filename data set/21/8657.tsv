2006-03-15T17:58:00.000Z	Kr4t05		Well, I guess I'm not worth the time or effort.
2006-03-15T06:04:00.000Z	Kr4t05		Does anyone know how I down-grade XMMS to 1.2.7?
2006-03-15T06:05:00.000Z	Genfoo	Kr4t05	why would you downgrade?
2006-03-15T06:05:00.000Z	Kr4t05	Genfoo	I need to for a plugin.
2006-03-15T06:05:00.000Z	Kr4t05	Genfoo	I need to get it to broadcast to a shout-cast server.
2006-03-15T06:06:00.000Z	Genfoo	Kr4t05	bah. there must be something better
2006-03-15T06:06:00.000Z	Kr4t05	Genfoo	Googline again.
2006-03-15T06:06:00.000Z	Genfoo	Kr4t05	whatever. anyway, check out www.xmms.org tarballs of old releases
2006-03-15T06:12:00.000Z	Kr4t05	Genfoo	Poked around Synaptic, I think I found something.
2006-03-15T06:28:00.000Z	Kr4t05	Genfoo	thanks for the help, anyway.
2006-03-15T06:28:00.000Z	Kr4t05	Genfoo	I found what I was looking for. It was on the ShoutCast website.
2006-03-15T06:28:00.000Z	Genfoo	Kr4t05	shoutcast and linux can be really messy
2006-03-15T06:28:00.000Z	Kr4t05	Genfoo	sc_trans_linux should work.
2006-03-15T06:29:00.000Z	Genfoo	Kr4t05	except it doesn't -_-
2006-03-15T06:29:00.000Z	Kr4t05	Genfoo	?!
2006-03-15T06:29:00.000Z	Kr4t05	Genfoo	I'll take a shot at it.
2006-03-15T06:30:00.000Z	Kr4t05	Genfoo	I have a shell account on a webserver, so, no big.
2006-03-15T06:30:00.000Z	Genfoo	Kr4t05	your own server? just wondering :P
2006-03-15T06:31:00.000Z	Kr4t05	Genfoo	No, friend of mine, sells dedi's and shells.
2006-03-15T06:31:00.000Z	Kr4t05	Genfoo	Only $7AUD
2006-03-15T06:31:00.000Z	Kr4t05	Genfoo	/mo
