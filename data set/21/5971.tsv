2007-08-09T13:41:00.000Z	Giddion55		hmm,  cant find what distro it is :@,  is linking up a domain to an IP the same in most distros?
2007-08-09T13:42:00.000Z	lockd	Giddion55	looking up a domain (DNS entry)? That's the same virtually everywhere (even windows)
2007-08-09T13:45:00.000Z	Giddion55	lockd	--  so how would i link an ip to a domain name in nix?
2007-08-09T13:45:00.000Z	lockd	Giddion55	You are trying to set up BIND?
2007-08-09T13:46:00.000Z	lockd	Giddion55	or are you trying to do what is called a "reverse lookup" and get a domain -from- a known IP
2007-08-09T13:46:00.000Z	Giddion55	lockd	no idea mate,  ive been asked by a friend to link his IP upto a domain name   yaaaaddaaa.lala.com
2007-08-09T13:46:00.000Z	Giddion55	lockd	 the IP is known,  i know the ip,  i want it so when u type   lalal.lalal.com in an explorer u go to the website hosted on the IP
2007-08-09T13:48:00.000Z	lockd	Giddion55	um, what Web browser are you using?
2007-08-09T13:48:00.000Z	lockd	Giddion55	that's a problem, and if you are able to do it manually ... strange
2007-08-09T13:49:00.000Z	lockd	Giddion55	can you nslookup or ping the site, then type http://ipaddresshere
2007-08-09T13:50:00.000Z	Giddion55	lockd	 the site works when u type http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx it works fine,  i just wanna make the ip into a domain name
2007-08-09T13:50:00.000Z	lockd	Giddion55	can you get to regular domains fine like google.com?
2007-08-09T13:51:00.000Z	lockd	Giddion55	ohh, i was under the impression it wasn't looking up stuff correctly
2007-08-09T13:51:00.000Z	Giddion55	lockd	hehe no sorry,  i just wanna link an ip to a name
2007-08-09T13:51:00.000Z	lockd	Giddion55	just do a search for reverse dns lookup
2007-08-09T13:52:00.000Z	Giddion55	lockd	hmm ok so thats all i need to setup?  can i break anything on his server?
2007-08-09T13:53:00.000Z	lockd	Giddion55	break anything on his server?
2007-08-09T13:53:00.000Z	Giddion55	lockd	 ye,  can i break anything on my mates server if i do this reverse lookup
2007-08-09T13:54:00.000Z	lockd	Giddion55	it shouldn't, and even if it did it's asking the DNS server, not his server
2007-08-09T13:56:00.000Z	lockd	Giddion55	nslookup is generally used remotely
2007-08-09T13:59:00.000Z	Giddion55	lockd	 ok mate thanks for your help,  im gonna head over to the networking channel and read some stuff on nslookup :)  thanks again.
