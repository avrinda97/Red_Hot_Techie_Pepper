2007-04-06T09:37:00.000Z	xtknight		torrent it
2007-04-06T09:37:00.000Z	xtknight		i have torrents go at 600k regularly.. ubuntu ones
2007-04-06T09:37:00.000Z	xtknight		dmz or port forward
2007-04-06T09:39:00.000Z	GaiaX11	xtknight	Feisty?
2007-04-06T09:40:00.000Z	xtknight	GaiaX11	me? ya
2007-04-06T09:40:00.000Z	xtknight	GaiaX11	naw.  just low on memory i believe.  happened on dapper/edgy/any linux
2007-04-06T09:41:00.000Z	GaiaX11	xtknight	how much memory do you have in?
2007-04-06T09:41:00.000Z	xtknight	GaiaX11	2 gigs.  but it runs out after i start my VM and my compulsive tab opening habits.  regularly 25 windows with about 5 tabs each
2007-04-06T09:42:00.000Z	xtknight	GaiaX11	only reason im complaining with that type of usage is because windows seems slightly faster under the same conditions
2007-04-06T09:43:00.000Z	GaiaX11	xtknight	I am not sure if the issue is memory in this case
2007-04-06T09:43:00.000Z	xtknight	GaiaX11	no, it isn't.  he doesn't have glx enabled
2007-04-06T09:44:00.000Z	xtknight	GaiaX11	Feisty actually seems to be faster for me
2007-04-06T09:45:00.000Z	GaiaX11	xtknight	Might be something in ubuntu installation. Have you asked the guys about this slowness? Is it normal in feisty?
2007-04-06T09:45:00.000Z	xtknight	GaiaX11	trust me, it's just my habits
2007-04-06T09:45:00.000Z	xtknight	GaiaX11	it is not just feisty also.  it's probably a GTK thing
2007-04-06T09:45:00.000Z	xtknight	GaiaX11	some gtk engines can not accelerate as well.
2007-04-06T09:46:00.000Z	xtknight	GaiaX11	murrine for example is considerably slower than clearlooks for drawing.  that may have bene my problem.
2007-04-06T09:46:00.000Z	GaiaX11	xtknight	Ok. Because I am still running dapper here and it is very fast
2007-04-06T09:47:00.000Z	xtknight	GaiaX11	ya gtk theme thing i think.
2007-04-16T07:49:00.000Z	GaiaX11	xtknight	Do you mean feisty?
2007-04-16T07:49:00.000Z	xtknight	GaiaX11	yea
