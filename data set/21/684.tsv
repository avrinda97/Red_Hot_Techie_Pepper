2011-12-06T23:27:00.000Z	RedXIII		Anyone help me out here? I randomly can't type in ubuntu 11.10
2011-12-06T23:28:00.000Z	auronandace	RedXIII	you using a wireless keyboard?
2011-12-06T23:28:00.000Z	RedXIII	auronandace	No, laptop built in
2011-12-06T23:28:00.000Z	auronandace	RedXIII	as in other desktops? (xfce, kde etc.)
2011-12-06T23:28:00.000Z	RedXIII	auronandace	Grub screen and windows 7
2011-12-06T23:29:00.000Z	auronandace	RedXIII	oh, are you using unity?
2011-12-06T23:29:00.000Z	RedXIII	auronandace	I guess.. Its a fresh install of ubuntu 11.10
2011-12-06T23:30:00.000Z	RedXIII	auronandace	I had been using it fine for the past 2 days. Then my restart this morning caused the keyboard not to function. (It was functioning prior to restart)
2011-12-06T23:30:00.000Z	auronandace	RedXIII	i'd guess its a compiz issue, if you log out and log back in but pick no effects in the session box when you log in
2011-12-06T23:31:00.000Z	RedXIII	auronandace	So basically pick "Gnome - No Effects" from "Ubuntu" on the login screen?
2011-12-06T23:31:00.000Z	RedXIII	auronandace	Or pick Ubuntu 2d fallback
2011-12-06T23:32:00.000Z	auronandace	RedXIII	i'd try no effects, to rule out compiz (i think unity 2d still uses compiz(i might be wrong))
2011-12-06T23:33:00.000Z	RedXIII	auronandace	And Ubuntu 2D doesn't work either.
2011-12-06T23:34:00.000Z	auronandace	RedXIII	ah
2011-12-06T23:34:00.000Z	auronandace	RedXIII	i'm not sure what to suggest sorry
2011-12-06T23:37:00.000Z	RedXIII	auronandace	Well.. Keyboard works fine after I woke it from Suspend once. Even though multiple restarts didn't do anything. I don't even...
2011-12-06T23:38:00.000Z	auronandace	RedXIII	odd
2012-02-16T03:06:00.000Z	auronandace	RedXIII	ubuntu uses uuid by default so the dev name doesn't really matter to ubuntu
2012-02-16T03:06:00.000Z	RedXIII	auronandace	Then why does gparted fail to recognize the partition?
2012-02-16T03:07:00.000Z	auronandace	RedXIII	no idea
2012-02-16T03:08:00.000Z	auronandace	RedXIII	i'm just saying if you were using device names rather than uuid then ubuntu wouldn't boot when the device names change
