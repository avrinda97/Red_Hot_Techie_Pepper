2010-11-05T22:08:00.000Z	rinku_kokiri		that and pa_stream_writable_size(): Connection failed
2010-11-05T22:09:00.000Z	rinku_kokiri		would happen randomly every 2-30 mins while watching a video
2010-11-05T22:11:00.000Z	rinku_kokiri		I uninstalled that and the problem went away, but i STILL (as in i had it before) have the "i can't change volume with the volume control" problem
2010-11-05T22:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rinku_kokiri	 i would wonder if its the sound card going to 'sleep' for some odd reason.
2010-11-05T22:12:00.000Z	rinku_kokiri	Dr_Willis	it is an old Creative card
2010-11-05T22:12:00.000Z	rinku_kokiri	Dr_Willis	vbwe espically old dells
2010-11-05T22:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rinku_kokiri	 there was some issues befor with sound cards going into sleep mode when not in use. causing issues.. every 20 min. sort of flaged me thinking of that. would be VERY weird if it did it while its playing however.
2010-11-05T22:13:00.000Z	rinku_kokiri	Dr_Willis	welllll........ hold on a sec, lemmie get my bug report
2010-11-05T22:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rinku_kokiri	 as for the sound volume. I recall having to use a mixer tool i could set to adjust the 'pcm' or 'master' volume.
2010-11-05T22:13:00.000Z	rinku_kokiri	Dr_Willis	thing is, if i fiddle with it enough (mute, unmute, vol up, down, up) it finally works

2010-11-06T11:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rinku_kokiri	 go for the newest... we realluy cant tell what YOU need...
2010-11-06T11:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rinku_kokiri	 no idea. Ive never used studio, never needed jackd either.
2010-11-06T11:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rinku_kokiri	 i do belive that one feature of studio was it was set up better for audio work.
2010-11-06T11:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rinku_kokiri	 if the kernel is in the repos. You apt-get install it, other wise you do compile it.
2010-11-06T11:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rinku_kokiri	  You can fit ubuntu onto a 8gb flash drive easially for testing. :)
