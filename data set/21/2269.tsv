2009-11-21T10:18:00.000Z	Dallas1		phogphrai: it should be. let me check
2009-11-21T10:20:00.000Z	Dallas1		phogphrai: blender is in the repository. I used it a little for some 3d modelling last month, it's extremely powerfull. Just has a bit of a learning curve
2009-11-21T10:20:00.000Z	Dallas1		electrictape: just get it from synaptic package manager.
2009-11-21T10:22:00.000Z	Dallas1		actually, if I could somehow diagnose this random lockup I wouldn't need to downgrade from 9.04 to 8.04.3
2009-11-21T10:23:00.000Z	Dallas1		roger: opensync?
2009-11-21T10:24:00.000Z	Dallas1		roger: or barrybackup-gui
2009-11-21T10:24:00.000Z	Dallas1		flan: the driver isn't made for 9.1
2009-11-21T10:25:00.000Z	Dallas1		flan: the graphics driver
2009-11-21T10:26:00.000Z	Dallas1		flan: I don't think there's alot of functionality for it in 9.04 but it's working right now, it just locks up after 10 minutes or so of use.
2009-11-21T10:27:00.000Z	Dallas1		flan: I don't even know if the lockup is a graphics issue, because my mouse will work, but the OS and whatever program I have open is unresponsive. I've let it sit for an hour with no changes
2009-11-21T10:28:00.000Z	mcurran	Dallas1	 Are you installing to a USB or from a USB
2009-11-21T10:29:00.000Z	Dallas1	mcurran	from
2009-11-21T10:30:00.000Z	Dallas1	mcurran	what flan said
2009-11-21T10:30:00.000Z	Dallas1	mcurran	it will boot. It gets to the portion where
2009-11-21T10:31:00.000Z	Dallas1	mcurran	you install the cd-rom to start installation. and since it isn't a cd-rom. There's nowhere to go
2009-11-21T10:35:00.000Z	mcurran	Dallas1	 What are you running on the netbook now?
2009-11-21T10:35:00.000Z	Dallas1	mcurran	9.04
2009-11-21T10:36:00.000Z	mcurran	Dallas1	 So did you understand what I said, you probably have the bootloader's kernel line and image entry pointing to /dev/cdrom0 instead of the USB drive
2009-11-21T10:36:00.000Z	Dallas1	mcurran	I have no idea.
2009-11-21T10:43:00.000Z	mcurran	Dallas1	 If you're still here - mount the USB with 9.04 and look in the boot folder for your bootloader
2009-11-21T11:01:00.000Z	Dallas1	mcurran	flan was helping but I think he logged. I put initrd.gz and vmlinux on the usb stick, what else do I need to edit to tell it to use the usb and not cdr
