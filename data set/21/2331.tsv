2010-02-25T12:41:00.000Z	greezmunkey	stevr1it	that's about right... you need to figure out where "docvert" came from, you could kill the processes perhaps...
2010-02-25T12:41:00.000Z	stevr1it		how can i kill it?
2010-02-25T12:42:00.000Z	greezmunkey	stevr1it	hold a sec...
2010-02-25T12:43:00.000Z	greezmunkey	stevr1it	docvert is a web application, are you running a webserver? Maybe somewhere in FF?
