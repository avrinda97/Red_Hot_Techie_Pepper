2008-06-08T16:31:00.000Z	krissyafc		I need help with my wireless drivers
2008-06-08T16:31:00.000Z	jrib	krissyafc	did you read the link from ubottu?
2008-06-08T16:32:00.000Z	jrib	krissyafc	then you need to ask a specific question
2008-06-08T16:32:00.000Z	jrib	krissyafc	(on a single line since the channel is so busy, please)
2008-06-08T16:34:00.000Z	jrib	krissyafc	what is the output of: lsb_release -c
2008-06-08T16:35:00.000Z	jrib	krissyafc	are you positive you spelled "dpkg" correctly?
2008-06-08T16:36:00.000Z	jrib	krissyafc	what if you try /usr/bin/dpkg?
2008-06-08T16:38:00.000Z	jrib	krissyafc	did you try /usr/bin/dpkg instead of "dpkg"?
2008-06-08T16:41:00.000Z	jrib	krissyafc	if you can't just call "dpkg" and need to give the full path, your PATH variable is messed up
2008-06-08T16:43:00.000Z	krissyafc	jrib	its setting up modules and things from that command you gave me ..is that ok?
2008-06-08T16:43:00.000Z	jrib	krissyafc	that's fine, did you see my comment about your PATH
2008-06-08T16:43:00.000Z	krissyafc	jrib	yes
2008-06-08T16:44:00.000Z	jrib	krissyafc	have you edited your PATH variable?
2008-06-08T16:44:00.000Z	krissyafc	jrib	how do i do that?
2008-06-08T16:44:00.000Z	jrib	krissyafc	what does 'echo $PATH' return?
2008-06-08T16:46:00.000Z	krissyafc	jrib	/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games
2008-06-08T16:46:00.000Z	jrib	krissyafc	no reason for it not to find "dpkg" then, try 'hash -r' and make sure "dpkg" works
2008-06-08T17:10:00.000Z	jrib	krissyafc	have you sorted it out?
2008-06-08T17:15:00.000Z	jrib	krissyafc	your syntax in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist is wrong
2008-06-08T18:00:00.000Z	jrib	krissyafc	gksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
