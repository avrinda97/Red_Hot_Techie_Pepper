2009-08-13T09:33:00.000Z	Berzerker	seanius_	I have the 1030. works flawlessly on mine. never going back to windows. :P
2009-08-13T09:33:00.000Z	seanius_	Berzerker	110-1036NR
2009-08-13T09:33:00.000Z	Berzerker	seanius_	strange. what's different about it than the 1035?
2009-08-13T09:33:00.000Z	seanius_	Berzerker	great to hear.  no problems with soundcard or wired nic?
2009-08-13T09:33:00.000Z	Berzerker	seanius_	haven't tried wired NIC, sound works after an alsa update to 1.0.20
2009-08-13T09:33:00.000Z	seanius_	Berzerker	it might just be the color :)
2009-08-13T09:33:00.000Z	Berzerker	seanius_	I use wireless, so yeah.
2009-08-13T09:34:00.000Z	seanius_	Berzerker	so are you running jaunty or the bleeding edge or some mix?
2009-08-13T09:34:00.000Z	Berzerker	seanius_	jaunty dl from ubuntu.com
2009-08-13T09:35:00.000Z	seanius_	Berzerker	standard install or netbook remix?  (sorry for pummeling you with questions btw :)
2009-08-13T09:35:00.000Z	Berzerker	seanius_	this is my only means of internet right now, I was trying to run moblin, that OS looks sweet, but it just wouldn't boot, so I settled for this, but it's working fantastic for me
2009-08-13T09:35:00.000Z	Berzerker	seanius_	netbook remix
2009-08-13T09:36:00.000Z	Berzerker	seanius_	well you have the 1036, w/e the difference between that and the 1035 is lol but I think the only difference between yours and mine (1030) is the network card. you have a BCom 4315, I have a 13
2009-08-13T09:37:00.000Z	Berzerker	seanius_	I mean, I see the wired networking option available to be checked/unchecked in the settings, so it looks like it works
2009-08-13T09:38:00.000Z	seanius_	Berzerker	thanks for all the info.  i'll let you know how it goes
2009-08-13T09:39:00.000Z	Berzerker	seanius_	I probably won't be here, just here to ask a question, but gl anyway. if you need help you can email me if you want it
