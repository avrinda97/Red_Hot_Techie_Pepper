2008-10-06T05:56:00.000Z	etyrnal		what would cause an ubuntu machine to open thousands of active sessions to my isp's dns ??
2008-10-06T05:57:00.000Z	Gnea	etyrnal	visiting a porn website
2008-10-06T05:57:00.000Z	etyrnal	Gnea	but the machine is just sittingthere -- headless
2008-10-06T05:57:00.000Z	etyrnal	Gnea	nobosy is even loged into it
2008-10-06T05:57:00.000Z	Gnea	etyrnal	and its purpose is?
2008-10-06T05:59:00.000Z	Gnea	etyrnal	so it's a router?
2008-10-06T06:00:00.000Z	Gnea	etyrnal	so is the headless box the ubuntu box or the router?
2008-10-06T06:00:00.000Z	etyrnal	Gnea	the router is just where i see all the connections
2008-10-06T06:00:00.000Z	Gnea	etyrnal	okay, and what purpose does it serve? firewall? what?
2008-10-06T06:01:00.000Z	etyrnal	Gnea	the ubunto box?
2008-10-06T06:01:00.000Z	Gnea	etyrnal	there's another 'it' that i'm referring to?
2008-10-06T06:01:00.000Z	etyrnal	Gnea	it's a slave 3D renderer for Blender 3D
2008-10-06T06:01:00.000Z	Gnea	etyrnal	okay. is it running any network services of any kind?
2008-10-06T06:03:00.000Z	etyrnal	Gnea	if it is i'm not certain because i didn't set it up for any other purpose than to act as an available 3D renderer for distributed rendering -- all machines are local
2008-10-06T06:04:00.000Z	etyrnal	Gnea	in my router i see this...  http://pastebin.com/m1178172d  except for twenty plus pages of it...
2008-10-06T06:08:00.000Z	etyrnal	Gnea	i originally set it up using a monitor, but i only ssh to it now so i can start renders
2008-10-06T06:26:00.000Z	Gnea	etyrnal	looks like someone on 192.168.69.44 is browsing the web
2008-10-06T06:28:00.000Z	etyrnal	Gnea	in a tcp dump i see no http - only the dns stuff
2008-10-06T06:29:00.000Z	Gnea	etyrnal	well you'll need to look on .44 and figure out what app is trying to hit that ip
2008-10-06T06:29:00.000Z	Gnea	etyrnal	#networking might be able to help you out a bit better
2008-10-06T06:30:00.000Z	etyrnal	Gnea	thanks for theawesome tip!
