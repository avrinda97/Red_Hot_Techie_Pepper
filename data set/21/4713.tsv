2008-02-28T02:00:00.000Z	_Oz_		Question: how much of an impact does compiz have on my processor/RAM overhead?
2008-02-28T02:00:00.000Z	hischild	_Oz_	depends really ... you can disable most of it to use almost none .. or turn it all on and make a 8800gt sweat it's pants off
2008-02-28T02:01:00.000Z	_Oz_	hischild	I turned a lot of it on
2008-02-28T02:03:00.000Z	hischild	_Oz_	ofcourse if you run a vbox it'll rely heavily on it ... what specs you have?
2008-02-28T02:03:00.000Z	_Oz_	hischild	nvidia 7600 w/512mb, 2gb ram, 2.2ghz AMD 64 processor
2008-02-28T02:04:00.000Z	hischild	_Oz_	should be able to pull it quite nicely. You can turn off some unused features if you havne't done so already
2008-02-28T02:06:00.000Z	_Oz_	hischild	I just tried turning off desktop effects.  it definitely improves performance by a bit.  It's noticeable.  Not sure how to quantify it though.
2008-02-28T05:19:00.000Z	hischild	_Oz_	my biggest problem was my graphics :p
2008-03-03T05:05:00.000Z	hischild	_Oz_	it has a better look, you have to give em credit for that ... yet it doesn't improve workspeed, it slows you down ... not like compiz speeds things up
2008-03-03T05:05:00.000Z	_Oz_	hischild	right. it's a pig. anyway, we're offtopic now
2008-03-03T05:06:00.000Z	hischild	_Oz_	true ...
2008-03-03T05:06:00.000Z	hischild	_Oz_	www.imageshack.us
2008-03-03T05:10:00.000Z	hischild	_Oz_	where?
2008-03-03T05:21:00.000Z	hischild	_Oz_	you tried to switch views? it seems like it's on details or sth like that now ...
2008-03-03T05:21:00.000Z	_Oz_	hischild	not sure what you meant by switch views
2008-03-03T05:21:00.000Z	hischild	_Oz_	the way you view icons
2008-03-03T05:21:00.000Z	hischild	_Oz_	like tiles, a list or sth else
2008-03-03T05:21:00.000Z	_Oz_	hischild	I see. hold on
2008-03-03T05:22:00.000Z	_Oz_	hischild	when I ctrl-1 to go back to folder views that error data goes away, but it comes back when I ctrl-2 back to detailed view (which I prefer).  is this just an output problem?
2008-03-03T05:23:00.000Z	hischild	_Oz_	hmm ... there might be another view to just list them all ...
2008-03-04T04:46:00.000Z	hischild	_Oz_	same for you :-)
