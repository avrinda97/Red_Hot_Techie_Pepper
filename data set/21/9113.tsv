2009-12-15T17:03:00.000Z	cast		is the partition mounted?
2009-12-15T17:04:00.000Z	cast		is crossover Free?
2009-12-15T17:05:00.000Z	cast		crossover is proprietary, so has no place here.
2009-12-15T17:07:00.000Z	cast		"Ubuntu core applications are all free and open source. We want you to use free and open source software, improve it and pass it on."
2009-12-15T17:07:00.000Z	cast		sounds like ubuntu wants me to use non-proprietary software
2009-12-15T17:07:00.000Z	frogzoo	cast	noo - only core ubuntu is open source, multiverse is free for all
2009-12-15T17:08:00.000Z	cast	frogzoo	what exactly are you disagreeing with?
2009-12-15T17:08:00.000Z	cast	frogzoo	what i pasted with from the ubuntu front page?
2009-12-15T17:08:00.000Z	frogzoo	cast	ubuntu/canonical has no foss axe to grind
2009-12-15T17:09:00.000Z	cast	frogzoo	fine, ignore the ubuntu front page.
2009-12-15T17:09:00.000Z	frogzoo	cast	they're not stallings by a long mile
2009-12-15T17:09:00.000Z	cast	frogzoo	make sure you ignore http://www.ubuntu.com/community/ubuntustory/philosophy, too
2009-12-15T17:10:00.000Z	frogzoo	cast	"Ubuntu _core_ applications are all free and open source."
2009-12-15T17:11:00.000Z	cast	frogzoo	and?
2009-12-15T17:11:00.000Z	cast		this conversation isn't going anywhere fast. you seem to not be reading everything.
2009-12-15T17:13:00.000Z	frogzoo	cast	so ubuntu's philosophy is perfectly compatible with running proprietary software - if that's what you choose to do
2009-12-15T17:15:00.000Z	cast		i don't recall any death threats.
2009-12-15T17:16:00.000Z	cast		maybe as users you guys don't unerstand what a pain in the ass it is dealing with proprietary packages, being forced to weight for upstream to fix things...sometimes taking years for them to do it,
2009-12-15T17:16:00.000Z	cast		uh, some english fail :(
2009-12-15T17:17:00.000Z	cast		[that's presuming you're allowed to package it]
2009-12-15T17:18:00.000Z	frogzoo	cast	heh, you're right about this conversation not going anywhere
