2005-12-15T06:46:00.000Z	MrBlowtatoes		unrar-nonfree don;t work for me, no such package exists
2005-12-15T06:46:00.000Z	Ng	MrBlowtatoes	or "rar" from multiverse
2005-12-15T06:48:00.000Z	Ng	MrBlowtatoes	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AddingRepositoriesHowto - use that to enable universe and multiverse, then apt/synaptic will find rar/unrar for you
2005-12-15T06:50:00.000Z	Ng	MrBlowtatoes	the document I gave you is very much related
2005-12-15T06:50:00.000Z	Ng	MrBlowtatoes	what are you using?
2005-12-15T06:51:00.000Z	Ng	MrBlowtatoes	keep scrolling down
2005-12-15T06:51:00.000Z	Ng	MrBlowtatoes	the page also includes instructions for the KDE Adept package manager
2005-12-15T06:53:00.000Z	Ng	MrBlowtatoes	you can edit /etc/apt/sources.list to add universe/multiverse repositories if you like, I was trying to make it easy, but you don't seem to have the useful tools installed :/
2005-12-15T06:54:00.000Z	Ng	MrBlowtatoes	do you not even have synaptic installed?
2005-12-15T06:59:00.000Z	Ng	MrBlowtatoes	if you run "sudo apt-get update" do you see it mention universe/multiverse?
2005-12-15T07:35:00.000Z	Ng	MrBlowtatoes	apt-cache search midi | grep sequencer   - that shows 11 matches :)
2005-12-15T07:46:00.000Z	Ng	MrBlowtatoes	sound
2005-12-15T07:48:00.000Z	Ng	MrBlowtatoes	that's because you only did a server install so it didn't configure sound
2005-12-15T07:48:00.000Z	Ng	MrBlowtatoes	once again, do a normal install and it will all work fine
