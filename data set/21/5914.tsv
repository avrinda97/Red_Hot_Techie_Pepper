2007-07-21T09:21:00.000Z	taime1		why is bruenig allowed to stay in here and act this way??\
2007-07-21T09:22:00.000Z	taime1		actually, he's NOT helpfull
2007-07-21T09:22:00.000Z	taime1		the help that i got was from jordan_u
2007-07-21T09:23:00.000Z	taime1		you know... i asked a legitimate question and instead of help, i got spoken to like an idiot, whats FUNNY is that bruenig was DEAD wrong and jordan_U was CORRECT
2007-07-21T09:24:00.000Z	taime1		its no wonder people are aprehensive about trying linux.
2007-07-21T09:24:00.000Z	taime1		who wants to come to a support channel and get treated this way?
2007-07-21T09:24:00.000Z	taime1		thats funny, because you were WRONG
2007-07-21T09:25:00.000Z	taime1		jordan_u your method worked, his did NOT
2007-07-21T09:25:00.000Z	boyam	taime1	actually Bruenig and Jordan_U told you the exact samething...b een watching your thread
2007-07-21T09:25:00.000Z	taime1	boyam	no they did not...
2007-07-21T09:26:00.000Z	boyam		lol nickrud..
2007-07-21T09:26:00.000Z	taime1		i can say that for jordan_u who was correct and NOT an ass
2007-07-21T09:27:00.000Z	taime1		i didnt install any codecs ... they were already installed
2007-07-21T09:27:00.000Z	taime1		what worked was when jordan_u told me to install totem-mozilla
2007-07-21T09:29:00.000Z	taime1		i have NEVER been treated this way in this channel, am i am very disappointed. all that wa required was a simple, "perhaps totem-mozilla will fix the problem" and instead, i got spoken to like an idiot...and bruenig still thinks he was right when he told me to UNinstall totem-mozilla
2007-07-21T09:29:00.000Z	taime1		he WAS wrong... he told me that mozilla-mplayer needed to be installed and totem-mozilla needed to be uninstalled.... but the opposite was true in the end
2007-07-21T09:30:00.000Z	taime1		so i have to say, he was infact, WRONG
2007-07-21T09:30:00.000Z	taime1		it doesnt matter how many times you say im wrong... it doesnt change the fact that bruenig was wrong and jordan_u was right
2007-07-21T09:31:00.000Z	taime1		well, call it an approach, but jordan_u's was correct, and bruenig's was not
2007-07-21T09:31:00.000Z	taime1		how is bruenig correct again??
2007-07-21T09:31:00.000Z	boyam	taime1	because it boiled down to be a codec problem....as bruenig kept telling you...
