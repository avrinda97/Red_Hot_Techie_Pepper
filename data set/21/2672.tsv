2009-11-13T12:48:00.000Z	ndroftheline		hey everybody i'm trying to run an .exe from within an iso
2009-11-13T12:48:00.000Z	ndroftheline		how do i do it?
2009-11-13T12:48:00.000Z	Billiard	ndroftheline	what is the exe for?
2009-11-13T12:48:00.000Z	ndroftheline	Billiard	it's for office 2003
2009-11-13T12:49:00.000Z	ndroftheline	Billiard	its a trusted backup
2009-11-13T12:49:00.000Z	Billiard	ndroftheline	ok, have you installed wine?
2009-11-13T12:49:00.000Z	ndroftheline	Billiard	yep
2009-11-13T12:49:00.000Z	ndroftheline	Billiard	i have the iso mounted with the Archive Mounter
2009-11-13T12:49:00.000Z	Billiard	ndroftheline	ok
2009-11-13T12:49:00.000Z	Billiard	ndroftheline	what happens when you try to run the exe with wine?
2009-11-13T12:50:00.000Z	ndroftheline	Billiard	well nothing. i right-click, click Run with Wine, and nothing happens.
2009-11-13T12:50:00.000Z	ndroftheline	Billiard	not even a spike in cpu usage, which i'm monitoring
2009-11-13T12:50:00.000Z	Billiard	ndroftheline	try mounting the cd without using archive mounter
2009-11-13T12:50:00.000Z	Billiard	ndroftheline	iso rather
2009-11-13T12:51:00.000Z	ndroftheline	Billiard	yeah i was going to do that but i wanted to learn more about archive mounter
2009-11-13T12:51:00.000Z	ndroftheline	Billiard	do you kow if it actually mounts it on a mount point somewhere in the filesystem or is it just instantiated in the program?
2009-11-13T12:51:00.000Z	Billiard	ndroftheline	yeah not really sure, it might not be actually be mounted somewhere
2009-11-13T12:52:00.000Z	ndroftheline	Billiard	yeah i'm afraid that's how it is. which sucks. why the hell didn't they just make archive moutner put it on a mount ponit?
2009-11-13T12:55:00.000Z	ndroftheline	Billiard	yeah it works fine if the iso is mounted normally.
2009-11-13T12:55:00.000Z	ndroftheline	Billiard	thanks
2009-11-13T12:55:00.000Z	Billiard	ndroftheline	ok
