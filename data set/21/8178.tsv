2006-05-24T11:28:00.000Z	mikebot		i also tried reinstalling totem-xine
2006-05-24T11:28:00.000Z	fender__	mikebot	do you have non-free codecs installed?
2006-05-24T11:28:00.000Z	mikebot	fender__	i'm unsure
2006-05-24T11:30:00.000Z	mikebot	fender__	i'm afraid i don't follow
2006-05-24T11:30:00.000Z	mikebot	fender__	what about totem though?
2006-05-24T11:32:00.000Z	mikebot	fender__	how do i do that?
2006-05-24T11:47:00.000Z	mikebot	fender__	could you help me out?
2006-05-24T11:47:00.000Z	fender__	mikebot	i will try, if it really is the codec related prob
2006-05-24T11:48:00.000Z	fender__	mikebot	first, try changing video output plugin as toad013 has said and see what happens
2006-05-24T11:50:00.000Z	fender__	mikebot	ok then you could try install codecs, first download codecs from here  -  http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/dload.html
2006-05-24T11:50:00.000Z	fender__	mikebot	you can try essential codecs first
2006-05-24T11:54:00.000Z	mikebot	fender__	ah ok
