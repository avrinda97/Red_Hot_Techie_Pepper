2006-06-04T13:32:00.000Z	facefacefaceface		ok, I just remembered what I came in hear to ask
2006-06-04T13:32:00.000Z	facefacefaceface		what is the deal with /tmp? why does it look green?
2006-06-04T13:34:00.000Z	facefacefaceface		if I left a file in tmp, and did a reboot, it should still be there?
2006-06-04T13:34:00.000Z	facefacefaceface		I wondered if green meant 'virtual'
2006-06-04T13:35:00.000Z	facefacefaceface		their is nothing 'special' about /tmp under ubuntu vs FC for example?
2006-06-04T13:35:00.000Z	facefacefaceface		I thought I had a file under /tmp, now I can't find it
2006-06-04T13:36:00.000Z	facefacefaceface		how can I search for the file which I thought was under /tmp?
2006-06-04T13:38:00.000Z	facefacefaceface		updatedb: fatal error: You are not authorized to create a default slocate database

2006-06-04T13:40:00.000Z	skippy81	facefacefaceface	 yes sudo is just your password , root is not set by default on ubuntu
2006-06-04T13:40:00.000Z	facefacefaceface	skippy81	ok
2006-06-04T13:55:00.000Z	skippy81	facefacefaceface	 if you want to see something funny get gentoo and try Portage lol - you will be begging for apt-get after that :)
2006-06-04T13:56:00.000Z	facefacefaceface	skippy81	is it better / worse than synaptic?
2006-06-04T13:57:00.000Z	skippy81	facefacefaceface	 it is more specialised - personally i would stick to apt-get
2006-06-04T13:58:00.000Z	facefacefaceface	skippy81	sure
2006-06-04T14:12:00.000Z	skippy81	facefacefaceface	argggh :)
2006-06-04T14:29:00.000Z	facefacefaceface	skippy81	did you see my 'sudo apt-get update' error?
2006-06-04T14:30:00.000Z	skippy81	facefacefaceface	no i didnt, what was it?
2006-06-04T14:30:00.000Z	facefacefaceface	skippy81	its working now :)
2006-06-04T14:31:00.000Z	skippy81	facefacefaceface	good :)
