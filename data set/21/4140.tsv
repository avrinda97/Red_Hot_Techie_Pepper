2008-11-13T03:19:00.000Z	Frogging101		I installed ubuntu on my laptop recently, but wasn't able to create a swap space because I had too many partitions. I had my Windows partition, and the computer came with a system restore partition and some data storage partition. I can't add another partition, because I have too many. I want a swap space, because there are times when Ubuntu needs more memory, and I would usually have to do a hard restart. Is there any way to have 
2008-11-13T03:19:00.000Z	mgolisch	Frogging101	you can use a swap file on your root partition
2008-11-13T03:42:00.000Z	Frogging101	mgolisch	good idea...
2008-11-13T03:33:00.000Z	mgolisch	Frogging101	yeah thats true
2008-11-13T03:35:00.000Z	Frogging101	mgolisch	My original problem was that I wanted a swap space, but I have too many partitions. All the partitions are mandatory for Windows and Ubuntu, so I can't get rid of any. how can i put in a swap space?
2008-11-13T03:36:00.000Z	mgolisch	Frogging101	you cant, unless you delete one partition and make it an extened one, but you should have done that before installtion, you can alternatively use a swap file instead
2008-11-13T03:37:00.000Z	Frogging101	mgolisch	What's a swap file
2008-11-13T03:39:00.000Z	mgolisch	Frogging101	its a file thats beeing used as swap space instead of a partition
2008-11-13T03:40:00.000Z	Frogging101	mgolisch	how do I make one?
2008-11-13T03:41:00.000Z	mgolisch	Frogging101	tried google?
2008-11-13T03:44:00.000Z	mgolisch	Frogging101	somewhere on your root partition
2008-11-13T03:44:00.000Z	Frogging101	mgolisch	root partition? I only have one ubuntu partition with a mount point of /
2008-11-13T03:44:00.000Z	Frogging101	mgolisch	file system ext3
2008-11-13T03:45:00.000Z	mgolisch	Frogging101	yeah that one, put it somewhere on there, maybe as /swap or so
2008-11-13T03:45:00.000Z	Frogging101	mgolisch	so... in a folder called swap in my / directory?
2008-11-13T03:46:00.000Z	mgolisch	Frogging101	o just name the file swap it doesnt need a own directory
2008-11-13T03:46:00.000Z	Frogging101	mgolisch	thanks, i am just really cautious after I accidentally made my windows partition a swap space, i lost everything
2008-11-13T03:53:00.000Z	mgolisch	Frogging101	/dev/zero is a special device that returns zeros, the other one is the output file dd writes count*bs into
2008-11-13T03:53:00.000Z	mgolisch	Frogging101	so in that case it reads 512mb of zeros and puts them into the file specified with the of= parameter
2008-11-13T03:54:00.000Z	Frogging101	mgolisch	so if I were to make the swap file, I would use that command, and after of= i would just put /swap.swap?
2008-11-13T03:54:00.000Z	mgolisch	Frogging101	yeah
