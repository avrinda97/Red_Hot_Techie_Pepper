2007-09-10T09:44:00.000Z	Jowi	Roly2	Maybe it's a silly question, but why are you trying doing this if it's your first time using linux? You are aware of that not all USB sticks support booting from them...?
2007-09-10T09:44:00.000Z	Roly2	bulmer	its something to do with partiton 1
2007-09-10T09:45:00.000Z	Roly2	bulmer	because the FAT partition cant be found anywhere
2007-09-10T09:45:00.000Z	Roly2		yes
2007-09-10T09:45:00.000Z	Roly2	bulmer	yes
2007-09-10T09:46:00.000Z	Roly2	bulmer	ive gone through all the steps up to step 5 of the 'using windows to prepare'
2007-09-10T09:47:00.000Z	Roly2		yes bulmer
2007-09-10T09:47:00.000Z	Roly2	bulmer	in fisk -l there's a FAT16 system and a Linux System partition
2007-09-10T09:48:00.000Z	Roly2	bulmer	but i cant see the FAT16 partition in windows OR linux
2007-09-10T09:48:00.000Z	Roly2	bulmer	so i cant add the files for the boot
2007-09-10T09:48:00.000Z	Jowi	Roly2	you need to format it (step 7)
