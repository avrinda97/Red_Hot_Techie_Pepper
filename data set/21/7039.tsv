2006-12-10T11:22:00.000Z	Prometheum		Does anyone know where I can change the graphics card from board-integrated to my other card?
2006-12-10T11:23:00.000Z	Prometheum		travis: its in the bios for my bios, but once it gets to the OS it changes
2006-12-10T11:24:00.000Z	Prometheum		I did it on SuSe in YAST, is there anything like that on Ubuntu?
2006-12-10T11:26:00.000Z	Prometheum		How would I go about changing hardware settings such as what graphics card is used?
2006-12-10T11:28:00.000Z	ablyss	Prometheum	double check the bios and make sure you booting to AGP not PCI, check if there is an option to disable onboard video too,
2006-12-10T11:29:00.000Z	Prometheum	ablyss	My bios has the option, but ubuntu can only boot to my board-integrated otherwise my xserver crashes
2006-12-10T11:30:00.000Z	ablyss	Prometheum	xserver crashes means you've successfully chaged video devices though
2006-12-10T11:30:00.000Z	Prometheum	ablyss	So how can I celebrate my xserver crashes with a nice gui?
2006-12-10T11:31:00.000Z	ablyss	Prometheum	so youre question should be how to keep xserver alive
2006-12-10T11:32:00.000Z	ablyss	Prometheum	sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg in the command shell after xserver crashes, but remember this may render your working onboard video to an unworking state
2006-12-10T11:32:00.000Z	Prometheum	ablyss	yes, I suppose so, but how can I use my far better pci card? I've used SuSe and YAST before, and I could do it there, is there anything like that on ubuntu and if so where?
2006-12-10T11:34:00.000Z	Prometheum	ablyss	there's no way to do it besides that? I may need to use my board integrated, though not for ubuntu
2006-12-10T11:34:00.000Z	ablyss	Prometheum	 the "sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg" command should run you through a video card setup for the xorg.conf file.. after that you can restart X
2006-12-10T11:35:00.000Z	Prometheum	ablyss	is there anything I can do with it on to change the card it uses from 0 to 1?
2006-12-10T11:35:00.000Z	ablyss	Prometheum	if the onboard video is unworkable after that.. just reset bios to use onboard video and run "sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg" again
2006-12-10T11:36:00.000Z	ablyss	Prometheum	someone else may have a better idea.. that would be my first try though
2006-12-10T11:37:00.000Z	Prometheum	ablyss	how would I access xserver with it running on command line? I remember how to do it, I just was able to get to it easier on SUSE
2006-12-10T11:39:00.000Z	Prometheum	ablyss	also, if I were installing most of the rpg's that came with edgy, would I experience what looked like a crash on the part of the package manager?
2006-12-10T11:39:00.000Z	ablyss	Prometheum	I've seen software that edits the bios from the OS end.. but it's been so long i dont remember.. and to access X from the command you simply type sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart or /etc/init.d/kdm restart ( kdm for kubuntu) ( gdm for ubuntu )
2006-12-10T11:40:00.000Z	Prometheum	ablyss	thanks, I'll be implementing that now. thanks for helping a noob!
2006-12-10T11:41:00.000Z	ablyss	Prometheum	the default package manager defaults to international repository.. which for would stall out and look like a crash maybe for those using synaptic.. enable repositories to use United State server fixes this
