2009-10-10T06:48:00.000Z	maco	kermit	chkconfig works just like in centos/rhel
2009-10-10T06:48:00.000Z	kermit	maco	thats not installed by default.. is there any that i'm "supposed" to use?
2009-10-10T06:49:00.000Z	maco	kermit	by default itd just be adding and removing symlinks. update-rc.d exists, but its really meant to be used by maintainer scripts in packages, not by people
2009-10-10T06:50:00.000Z	kermit	maco	heh it's man page recommends using bum, which doestn really do it
2009-10-10T06:51:00.000Z	kermit	maco	'or editing the links directly'... i guess i'll go with chkconfig
