2006-06-06T12:21:00.000Z	mo0se		i don't think that's how it works, gambit.
2006-06-06T12:21:00.000Z	mo0se		what i do is just format that partition.
2006-06-06T12:22:00.000Z	gambit	mo0se	i try it says its in use
2006-06-06T12:22:00.000Z	mo0se	gambit	you're trying with what?
2006-06-06T12:22:00.000Z	mo0se	gambit	from a different partition or a cd or something?
2006-06-06T12:23:00.000Z	gambit	mo0se	gparted
2006-06-06T12:23:00.000Z	gambit	mo0se	yes
2006-06-06T12:24:00.000Z	mo0se	gambit	that's why it says it's in use. heheheh.
2006-06-06T12:24:00.000Z	gambit	mo0se	hahA, how do u do it
2006-06-06T12:24:00.000Z	mo0se	gambit	what i do is use partition magic from my windows partition.
2006-06-06T12:26:00.000Z	gambit	mo0se	i have no windows and ubuntu wont let me burn a boot disk
2006-06-06T12:26:00.000Z	mo0se	gambit	you don't have any type of operating system disk?
2006-06-06T12:27:00.000Z	gambit	mo0se	no, i thought ubuntu was all id ever need
2006-06-06T12:28:00.000Z	mo0se	gambit	well i don't know...
2006-06-06T12:28:00.000Z	gambit	mo0se	i have a win98 but it wont write over linux
2006-06-06T12:29:00.000Z	mo0se	gambit	what are you going to do after you delete ubuntu?
2006-06-06T12:29:00.000Z	gambit	mo0se	Load win98, download suse10 burn iso
2006-06-06T12:30:00.000Z	mo0se	gambit	well i guess you can find another computer or figure out why ubuntu won't let you burn a cd and fix it.
2006-06-06T12:31:00.000Z	gambit	mo0se	been watching forums for a week, no resolve just more complaints
2006-06-06T12:32:00.000Z	mo0se	gambit	well... i suppose you can find someone else with a computer, download suse, and burn it.
2006-06-06T12:32:00.000Z	gambit	mo0se	Good idea
