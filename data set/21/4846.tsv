2008-01-30T02:04:00.000Z	LockesRabb		im using ubuntu, my desktop icons are missing, what to do?
2008-01-30T02:04:00.000Z	LockesRabb		i know, there is now
2008-01-30T02:05:00.000Z	LockesRabb		i had two folders there before, one named sc, one named storage
2008-01-30T02:05:00.000Z	LockesRabb		but now those folders are gone, but when i go in terminal and check desktop directory, those folders exist
2008-01-30T02:06:00.000Z	LockesRabb		any ideas on how to get the desktop icons back?
2008-01-30T02:06:00.000Z	LockesRabb		im thinking maybe the navigator is screwed?
2008-01-30T02:07:00.000Z	unop	LockesRabb	restart nautilus?
2008-01-30T02:07:00.000Z	LockesRabb	unop	how would i do that?
2008-01-30T02:07:00.000Z	unop	LockesRabb	press ALT+f2 - killall nautilus && nautilus
2008-01-30T02:08:00.000Z	unop	LockesRabb	cool
2008-01-30T02:10:00.000Z	unop	LockesRabb	perhaps you could repair nautilus - i doubt it works but worth a try - sudo apt-get install --reinstall nautilus gnome-session
2008-01-30T02:11:00.000Z	LockesRabb	unop	what irc program do you use?
2008-01-30T02:11:00.000Z	unop	LockesRabb	xchat mostly, but sometimes i use irssi
2008-01-30T02:13:00.000Z	LockesRabb	unop	i absolutely love you
2008-01-30T02:14:00.000Z	unop	LockesRabb	:)
2008-01-30T02:18:00.000Z	LockesRabb	unop	where's the boot up log?
2008-01-30T02:18:00.000Z	unop	LockesRabb	usually /var/log/{syslog,messages}
2008-01-30T02:18:00.000Z	LockesRabb	unop	thanks
2008-01-30T02:19:00.000Z	unop	LockesRabb	you can use the gnome-system-log to view them
2008-01-30T02:24:00.000Z	LockesRabb	unop	have u used compiz fusion before
2008-01-30T02:25:00.000Z	unop	LockesRabb	i dont do fancy eye-candy .. i think compwiz is a complete waste of time
