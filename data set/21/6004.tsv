2008-01-06T15:52:00.000Z	bidossessi		looking for a software thtou will index all my videos into a library like rhythmbox does for music
2008-01-06T15:52:00.000Z	bidossessi		any pointers welcome
2008-01-06T15:53:00.000Z	bidossessi		no i am talking about the concept of it
2008-01-06T15:54:00.000Z	bidossessi		list all video files into a catalog instead of having to go look for them wherever they are
2008-01-06T15:55:00.000Z	bidossessi		i'm looking for a solution for a media center
2008-01-06T15:55:00.000Z	khermans	bidossessi	mythtv
2008-01-06T15:53:00.000Z	khermans	bidossessi	yeah it is not the same
2008-01-06T15:54:00.000Z	khermans	bidossessi	gtkpod does it for videos on the ipod
2008-01-06T15:55:00.000Z	khermans	bidossessi	how about google desktop :-)
2008-01-06T15:55:00.000Z	khermans	bidossessi	or plenty of other file indexers
2008-01-06T15:56:00.000Z	bidossessi	khermans	i think mythtv requires the presence of a tuner card, which i don't have/need
2008-01-06T15:57:00.000Z	khermans	bidossessi	you dont need to have one i dont think
2008-01-06T15:57:00.000Z	khermans	bidossessi	but it stll doesnt aggregate files from many directories
2008-01-06T15:57:00.000Z	khermans	bidossessi	you know about google desktop?
2008-01-06T15:59:00.000Z	bidossessi	khermans	freevo might be more in tune with what i need. i'll check it out
2008-01-06T16:00:00.000Z	khermans	bidossessi	cool -- good luck
2008-01-06T16:01:00.000Z	khermans	bidossessi	i would either figure out why it broke from thinking what you did or check logs -- otherwise upgrade ot gutsy
2008-01-06T16:27:00.000Z	khermans	bidossessi	ssh -Y
2008-01-06T16:27:00.000Z	khermans	bidossessi	yup :-)
2008-01-06T16:30:00.000Z	bidossessi	khermans	i love the way you dispatch bits of knowledge around :)
2008-01-06T16:30:00.000Z	khermans	bidossessi	hehe just an oldtime ubunut user since warty myself..
