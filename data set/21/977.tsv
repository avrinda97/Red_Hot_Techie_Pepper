The bottom line is: Its always good to download a file again if checksum of original does not match that of downloaded one.
2011-07-31T21:11:00.000Z	milen8204	drake01	Thanks but I tried to reinstall my OS and it crashes every time

2011-07-31T21:19:00.000Z	milen8204		and the massage : "the file is possibly corrupt the file header checksum does not match the computed checksum" appeared
2011-07-31T21:21:00.000Z	drake01	milen8204	 Ok, so how did you install ubuntu again? What did you use to install it?
2011-07-31T21:21:00.000Z	milen8204	drake01	I didnt install it again I just tried but it crashes every time

2011-07-31T21:25:00.000Z	milen8204	drake01	CD whit Ubuntu
2011-07-31T21:25:00.000Z	milen8204		10.10 i think
2011-07-31T21:27:00.000Z	drake01	milen8204	It seems the some of cd's files are corrupt. So, If you have access to good enough internet, I would suggest you to download the ubuntu iso from ubuntu.com? If you don't then reply so again
2011-07-31T21:29:00.000Z	drake01	milen8204	You may try gettin another cd also, if you can.
2011-07-31T21:34:00.000Z	milen8204	drake01	 and then ..?
2011-07-31T21:38:00.000Z	drake01	milen8204	You mean after downloading? You may burn the iso obtained on a removable usb or cd by following explained on http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/download
2011-07-31T21:40:00.000Z	milen8204	drake01	I will try but i don't think that is the CD problem
2011-07-31T21:44:00.000Z	drake01	milen8204	Try to search for other solutions then.
