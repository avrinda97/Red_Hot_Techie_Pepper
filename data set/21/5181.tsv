2010-08-16T19:30:00.000Z	SingAlong		How do I find the IP address of my router from ifconfig?
2010-08-16T19:32:00.000Z	SingAlong		I'm tethering wifi from my phone and to share desktop using remote desktop I need to know the server's address (which is the address of the phone right)?
2010-08-16T19:33:00.000Z	BluesKaj	SingAlong	if your phone is connected to the desktop , try route in the terminal
2010-09-22T19:55:00.000Z	BluesKaj	SingAlong	set those files you want access as shared
2010-09-22T19:55:00.000Z	SingAlong	BluesKaj	thanks!
2010-09-22T19:55:00.000Z	SingAlong	BluesKaj	I've been using ubuntu since 6.04 this is the first time I'm having this problem :)
2010-09-22T19:56:00.000Z	SingAlong	BluesKaj	right-click properties doesnt have the sharing option (i did a ctrl+A and rightclick)
2010-09-22T19:56:00.000Z	BluesKaj	SingAlong	consider yourself lucky , I can't access anything in linux from W7
2010-09-22T19:57:00.000Z	SingAlong	BluesKaj	ah? thats strange.
2010-09-22T19:58:00.000Z	SingAlong	BluesKaj	ubuntu is my primary operating system. i use windows mostly for a couple games i play every year.
2010-09-22T20:00:00.000Z	BluesKaj	SingAlong	I mean networked windows shares , not ntfs partition windows shares
2010-09-22T20:00:00.000Z	SingAlong	BluesKaj	oh! my problem is on the dual boot system.
2010-09-22T20:00:00.000Z	BluesKaj	SingAlong	no share tab on folder properties?
2010-09-22T20:01:00.000Z	SingAlong	BluesKaj	nope!
2010-09-22T20:02:00.000Z	SingAlong	BluesKaj	did you try shares-admin in the console?
2010-09-22T20:02:00.000Z	SingAlong	BluesKaj	its the old shares admin thing thats been removed. just a suggestion since your problem is between networked comps
2010-09-22T20:05:00.000Z	BluesKaj	SingAlong	I have no probs accessing windows shares from linux , from windows to linux access I use ssh for windows , a cli utility that works quite well
2010-09-22T20:06:00.000Z	SingAlong	BluesKaj	i think i found the solution. the dirs that were accessible via windows had their file access property as "---". so i've set the same thing to all the files now. let me check if they are accessible via win7
2010-09-22T20:06:00.000Z	SingAlong	BluesKaj	is putty still the best ssh client?
2010-09-22T20:06:00.000Z	SingAlong	BluesKaj	k. booting into windows to check if all's right
2010-09-22T20:06:00.000Z	BluesKaj	SingAlong	what app are you using to access your linux partition from your windows partition
