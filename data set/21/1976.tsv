2010-03-06T10:17:00.000Z	Hebram	claws	 lots of factors can affect your wifi speed and connectivity.  Distance, materials the radio waves travel though, cordless phones, baby monitors.
2010-03-06T10:18:00.000Z	claws	Hebram	i am max 10 meters away from router. or even just 1m from it
2010-03-06T10:22:00.000Z	Hebram	claws	 You should be using the ipw2200 driver and firmware.
2010-03-06T10:24:00.000Z	Hebram	claws	 I have that wifi adapter on an old dell and didn't have much success with the wext driver that wpa_supplicant uses.
2010-03-06T10:26:00.000Z	claws	Hebram	im here.. http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net/ ..not sure wich driver to download
2010-03-06T10:27:00.000Z	Hebram	claws	one minute
2010-03-06T10:30:00.000Z	claws	Hebram	ok, im on Ubuntu :) .. one more thing, do i list my hardware drivers with " lspci "  ?
2010-03-06T10:31:00.000Z	Hebram	claws	 do a "dmesg | grep 2200" and paste the output
2010-03-06T10:33:00.000Z	claws	Hebram	paste here...or pm ?
2010-03-06T10:34:00.000Z	claws	Hebram	[    9.156983] ipw2200: Intel(R) PRO/Wireless 2200/2915 Network Driver, 1.2.2kmprq
2010-03-06T10:35:00.000Z	Hebram	claws	 you are already running the proper ipw2200 drivers and firmware
2010-03-06T10:38:00.000Z	claws	Hebram	so its hopeless?  :(
2010-03-06T10:39:00.000Z	Hebram	claws	 I wouldn't say that.  My identical adapter works great in Karmic.  I did some googling and found that some are complaining that the adapter is slow in Karmic, but worked well in 9.04.
2010-03-06T10:40:00.000Z	claws	Hebram	hmm... i will check that out.. thank you :)
2010-03-06T10:41:00.000Z	Hebram	claws	 Wish I could have been of more assistance.
2010-03-06T10:41:00.000Z	Hebram	claws	 Good luck -)
2010-03-06T10:44:00.000Z	Hebram	claws	 Try downloading the 9.04 live CD and testing performance from that.  It could save you the trouble of committing to a downgraded OS install if it does not work.
2010-03-06T10:57:00.000Z	claws	Hebram	i will do that now :)
2010-03-06T10:58:00.000Z	Hebram	claws	 Good luck =)
2010-03-06T10:58:00.000Z	claws	Hebram	thx :)
