2005-12-13T10:03:00.000Z	tristan	testmachine	: what's that?
2005-12-13T10:03:00.000Z	testmachine	tristan	3D graphix
2005-12-13T10:04:00.000Z	tristan	testmachine	: how do you know if openGL is enabled?
2005-12-13T10:04:00.000Z	testmachine	tristan	glxgears
2005-12-13T10:05:00.000Z	tristan	testmachine	: when I do glxgears I see the wheel turning. Does that mean that openGL is enabled?
2005-12-13T10:05:00.000Z	testmachine	tristan	how many fps is it giving
2005-12-13T10:06:00.000Z	tristan	testmachine	: it is laggy but doesn't say any fps
2005-12-13T10:06:00.000Z	testmachine	tristan	you are opening it from a terminal?
2005-12-13T10:07:00.000Z	tristan	testmachine	: yes
2005-12-13T10:07:00.000Z	testmachine	tristan	will you paste some output from the terminal
2005-12-13T10:08:00.000Z	tristan	testmachine	: I don't know of any way to enable both the good resolution and the openGL
2005-12-13T10:11:00.000Z	testmachine	tristan	it wont work
2005-12-13T10:13:00.000Z	tristan	testmachine	: that is what I had understood from my viewing on some BBS
2005-12-13T11:08:00.000Z	testmachine	tristan	gdmsetup?
2005-12-13T11:09:00.000Z	tristan	testmachine	: well no because it doesnot allow you to modify the current theme you are using
2005-12-13T11:09:00.000Z	testmachine	tristan	then you have to go into the config files
2005-12-13T11:09:00.000Z	testmachine	tristan	but config files arent really difficult
2005-12-13T11:09:00.000Z	testmachine	tristan	when you read you will get it
2005-12-13T11:10:00.000Z	tristan	testmachine	: yes I know but you have to find the html colors for every colors you want to be displayed...
2005-12-13T11:10:00.000Z	testmachine	tristan	there are enough sites with "html colors"
