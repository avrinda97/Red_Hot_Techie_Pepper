2005-12-28T17:04:00.000Z	psycose	ossie	i think you should first find an official howto that will help you to undestand more ..
2005-12-28T17:07:00.000Z	psycose	ossie	what are you trying to do ?
2005-12-28T17:09:00.000Z	psycose	ossie	what is the tutorial ... ? at what step do you fail ?
2005-12-28T17:11:00.000Z	psycose	ossie	what is is the error ou get ? from what command ?
2005-12-28T17:12:00.000Z	psycose	ossie	use a pastebin so you can show other people later..

2005-12-28T17:19:00.000Z	psycose	ossie	 well are you using the good version of gcc to compile the kernel ?
2005-12-28T17:21:00.000Z	psycose	ossie	yes use 3.4 .....
2005-12-28T17:22:00.000Z	psycose	ossie	Debian power ;)-
2005-12-28T17:26:00.000Z	psycose	ossie	# ln -s target link_name
2005-12-28T17:33:00.000Z	psycose	ossie	you can use MAKEFLAGS="CC=gcc-2.95" to specify the gcc version you want to use ....
2005-12-28T17:34:00.000Z	psycose	ossie	so are you ok ?
2005-12-28T17:37:00.000Z	psycose	ossie	just remember to read the man first and you will boost increasingly
2005-12-28T17:41:00.000Z	psycose	ossie	remember to post the solution on the thread concerning the gcc version and eventually using  MAKEFLAGS="CC=gcc-3.4" make-kpkg ... this will help others ;-)
2005-12-28T06:36:00.000Z	psycose	ossie	may be
2005-12-28T06:38:00.000Z	psycose	ossie	sorry i don't think i can help you for this good luck
