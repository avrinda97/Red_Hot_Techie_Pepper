2010-05-18T09:33:00.000Z	ridin		lol
2010-05-18T09:34:00.000Z	ridin		is there anyway i can have thunderbird listed in the email indicator
2010-05-18T09:34:00.000Z	jabirali	ridin	no
2010-05-18T09:34:00.000Z	jabirali	ridin	I believe there are plans for a thunderbird plugin, but according to the web page the indicator applet doesn't have one yet
2010-05-18T09:36:00.000Z	jabirali	ridin	do you have anything else there than mail icon and volume control?
2010-05-18T09:37:00.000Z	ridin	jabirali	network manager, xchat, time and date, my user name and the power button
2010-05-18T09:37:00.000Z	jabirali	ridin	that's a "no" ;)
2010-05-18T09:37:00.000Z	jabirali	ridin	the things you listed are separate applets
2010-05-18T09:38:00.000Z	jabirali	ridin	you can remove the indicator applet from the panel, and make the command "gnome-volume-control-applet" run at startup to bring back the volume control
2010-05-18T09:38:00.000Z	jabirali	ridin	try pressing Alt+F2 and enter "gnome-volume-control-applet"
2010-05-18T09:39:00.000Z	jabirali	ridin	do you now have 2 volume control applets on the panel?
2010-05-18T09:39:00.000Z	ridin	jabirali	only one
2010-05-18T09:40:00.000Z	jabirali	ridin	after running the command you still have only one? What version are you running?
2010-05-18T09:40:00.000Z	jabirali	ridin	aha, then you should only have one :)
2010-05-18T09:41:00.000Z	jabirali	ridin	as long as you make "gnome-volume-control-applet" autostart in System -> Preferences -> Startup Applications, the indicator applet is useless if you don't use it the mail icon ;)
2010-05-18T09:43:00.000Z	ridin	jabirali	i restarted the indicator applet, and now i have 2 sound indicators, how can i remove the one you told me
2010-05-18T09:44:00.000Z	jabirali	ridin	OK, press Alt+F2 and enter "killall -9 gnome-volume-control-applet"
2010-05-18T09:47:00.000Z	ridin	jabirali	how do i restore the xchat system tray icon
2010-05-18T09:49:00.000Z	jabirali	ridin	that one shouldn't have disappeared by just removing the indicator applet, I guess you removed more applets... Right-click panel, add to panel, notification area
