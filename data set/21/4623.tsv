2008-04-16T03:27:00.000Z	Lainy		Hello, how do I permanently unhide a folder? The folder name does not begin with a dot (.), strangely.
2008-04-16T03:28:00.000Z	Slart	Lainy	I don't even know how to hide a folder without using the dot thing.. what file system are you using?
2008-04-16T03:28:00.000Z	Lainy	Slart	It's in an ext3 partition.
2008-04-16T03:29:00.000Z	Lainy	Slart	But I downloaded the file from a torrent, so it may have been a hidden folder on a Windows box.
2008-04-16T03:29:00.000Z	Slart	Lainy	and this folder.. it doesn't show up in nautilus? or how do you mean "hidden"
2008-04-16T03:29:00.000Z	Lainy	Slart	It shows only when I Ctrl+H to unhide folders.
2008-04-16T03:29:00.000Z	Slart	Lainy	and there is no dot
2008-04-16T03:30:00.000Z	Slart	Lainy	that's very very odd...
2008-04-16T03:30:00.000Z	Lainy	Slart	The folder icon, however, is slightly dimmed like all the other hidden folders (which do have a dot prefix).
2008-04-16T03:31:00.000Z	Lainy	Slart	Any ideas on how to unhide this folder? None of the files within it have a dot prefix either.
2008-04-16T03:31:00.000Z	Slart	Lainy	can you do a ls -la in the parent folder and pastebin it?
2008-04-16T03:32:00.000Z	Lainy	Slart	What's odd is that in a console, it shows up without the -a flag.
2008-04-16T03:32:00.000Z	Lainy	Slart	It shows up even with a normal ls.
2008-04-16T03:33:00.000Z	Lainy	Slart	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/63361/
2008-04-16T03:34:00.000Z	Slart	Lainy	bah.. sorry.. I meant ls -la
2008-04-16T03:35:00.000Z	Lainy	Slart	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/63362/
2008-04-16T03:36:00.000Z	Slart	Lainy	hah.. I just renamed a folder to that very name.. and now it's hidden too.. might be something with the "~" in the folder name
2008-04-16T03:37:00.000Z	Lainy	Slart	Oh that is very odd. Thanks, the problem is now fixed!
2008-04-16T03:38:00.000Z	Slart	Lainy	but now we've got a new problem.. why on earth does nautilus hide folders containing a ~ .. is that standard behaviour???
2008-04-16T03:38:00.000Z	Lainy	Slart	Hmm.. no idea :/
2008-04-16T03:39:00.000Z	Lainy	Slart	That's worthy of a bug report, I think.
