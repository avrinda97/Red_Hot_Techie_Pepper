2006-01-14T07:16:00.000Z	lowman62	jawshoewah	do you have any sound at all on your computer?
2006-01-14T07:17:00.000Z	lowman62	jawshoewah	when you boot up do you hear sound?
2006-01-14T07:26:00.000Z	lowman62	jawshoewah	try /usr/bin/xmms & at console and see if that opens it up
2006-01-14T07:28:00.000Z	lowman62	jawshoewah	what is the response please?
2006-01-14T07:29:00.000Z	lowman62	jawshoewah	try ....  whereis xmms
2006-01-14T07:33:00.000Z	lowman62	jawshoewah	close synaptic first
2006-01-14T07:34:00.000Z	lowman62	jawshoewah	it is installed already
2006-01-14T07:37:00.000Z	lowman62	jawshoewah	have tried just this at prompt since it is already in your path ... "xmms &" without quotes?
2006-01-14T07:39:00.000Z	lowman62	jawshoewah	sounds to me like it is running in process kill that process or however many of them you got going
2006-01-14T07:45:00.000Z	lowman62	jawshoewah	yt?
2006-01-14T07:46:00.000Z	lowman62	jawshoewah	did that work?
2006-01-14T07:47:00.000Z	lowman62	jawshoewah	kill <pid number>
2006-01-14T07:48:00.000Z	lowman62	jawshoewah	ps -al
2006-01-14T07:48:00.000Z	lowman62	jawshoewah	yw :)
2006-01-14T07:50:00.000Z	lowman62	jawshoewah	look to the right hand side of the output for xmms then locate its PID #
2006-01-14T07:50:00.000Z	lowman62	jawshoewah	or you can do it the Windblows way and reboot LOL
2006-01-14T07:51:00.000Z	lowman62	jawshoewah	or you can Applications>System Tools>System Monitor and at the Processes tab locate xmms and kill it from there
2006-01-14T07:54:00.000Z	lowman62	jawshoewah	that is why it is not working :P
2006-01-14T07:55:00.000Z	lowman62	jawshoewah	working now?
