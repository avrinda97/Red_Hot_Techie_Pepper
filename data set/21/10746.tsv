2005-01-04T15:44:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		and here's me extracting the initrd, modifying it and rebuilding
2005-01-04T15:46:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		heh
2005-01-04T15:48:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		I replaced the gateway machine with a wrt54gs, so we've only got three here (plux xbox)
2005-01-04T15:48:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		er.. four
2005-01-04T15:48:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		including laptop
2005-01-04T15:48:00.000Z	Seq	HrdwrBoB	i have a wrt54g, and it didnt work very well for me :(
2005-01-04T15:49:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Seq	yeah? why not, I run openwrt on it
2005-01-04T15:49:00.000Z	Seq	HrdwrBoB	it wouldnt do dns properly, and i didnt have time to mess around with it
2005-01-04T15:49:00.000Z	Seq	HrdwrBoB	i've been wanting to do that too
2005-01-04T15:50:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Seq	ah, I don't know, I never used the standard firmware, I put openwrt straight on
2005-01-20T16:27:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Seq	64 bit is nice, esp for a server
2005-01-20T16:27:00.000Z	Seq	HrdwrBoB	yeah, everybody i know with an athlond 64 just runs a 32 bit system on it. that said, performance kicks ass on it anyway
2005-01-20T16:28:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Seq	same :)
2005-01-20T16:28:00.000Z	Seq	HrdwrBoB	how are your temperatures on it? my friends are terrible, but i think it's his crappy heatsink and such
2005-01-20T16:30:00.000Z	Seq	HrdwrBoB	ah, i see. i actually have a mobile athlon-xp in my desktop, so i don't run one at all
2005-01-20T16:32:00.000Z	Seq	HrdwrBoB	mine is a athlon-xp mobile 2600+. its more than fast enough for anything i've needed to do, including a handful of games
2005-01-20T16:33:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Seq	I play quite a bit of games on mine, ut2k4, world of warcraft, warcraft3, doom3
2005-01-20T16:34:00.000Z	Seq	HrdwrBoB	i did a bit of doom 3, though i'm mostly doing ut2004, and counter-strike source lately
2005-01-20T16:34:00.000Z	Seq	HrdwrBoB	the only issues i've had is with dosbox, just because that thing will eat as much cpu as you can throw at it
2005-01-20T16:35:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Seq	well dosbox is a full cpu/system emulator
2005-01-20T16:35:00.000Z	Seq	HrdwrBoB	exactly. but its just so fun to play betrayal at krondor again :D
