2007-01-22T16:01:00.000Z	bluefox83	wolfwalker	inside the directory it created, there is probably another subdirectory called src
2007-01-22T16:03:00.000Z	bluefox83	wolfwalker	whats the name of the folder that you got from unpacking the .tar file?
2007-01-22T16:04:00.000Z	bluefox83	wolfwalker	so cd Desktop/src/
