2011-03-26T22:57:00.000Z	caimlas__	dejan_	more than likely what you did was set a shell for the apache user. apache user should not have a shell.
2011-03-26T22:57:00.000Z	dejan_	ikonia	if I don't need it
2011-03-26T22:57:00.000Z	caimlas__	dejan_	I'm not 100% sure but I think ubuntu uses the same www-data user that debian does.
2011-03-26T22:57:00.000Z	dejan_		someone told me to do that
2011-03-26T22:57:00.000Z	dejan_		:S
2011-03-26T22:57:00.000Z	caimlas__	dejan_	so you shouldn't even need it, i don't think
2011-03-26T22:57:00.000Z	dejan_		maybe he hacked my os? :S
2011-03-26T22:57:00.000Z	dejan_		omg

2011-03-26T22:58:00.000Z	dejan_		i need that?
2011-03-26T22:58:00.000Z	caimlas__	dejan_	um so did you give the other guy the user/pass?
