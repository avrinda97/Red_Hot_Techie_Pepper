2007-05-31T12:56:00.000Z	cox377	wols_	definatly got the right user name and password, the share does however have read/write guest

2007-05-31T12:58:00.000Z	wols_	cox377	does user "storeusername" exist on the host with the share?
2007-05-31T12:58:00.000Z	wols_	cox377	is it n the smb password file?
2007-05-31T12:59:00.000Z	cox377	wols_	the username is the username used to log into the store machine and the password is the password for the store machine, in terms of the SMB password file, is that on the server or client?
2007-05-31T13:00:00.000Z	cox377	wols_	what you think mate?
2007-05-31T13:00:00.000Z	wols_	cox377	server. man smbpasswd if it's a linux machine
2007-05-31T13:03:00.000Z	cox377	wols_	do you know roughtly where the smbpasswd file is located? command line only here
2007-05-31T13:04:00.000Z	wols_	cox377	in your path
2007-05-31T13:04:00.000Z	wols_	cox377	locate smbpasswd
2007-05-31T13:04:00.000Z	cox377	wols_	chjeers
2007-05-31T13:15:00.000Z	cox377	wols_	ok, i'm assuming i'm running this command "sudo smbpasswd -a cox", i run that which then prompts me for pass and confirm pass which i do, i then get "Failed to modify password entry for user cox" any ideas mate?
2007-05-31T13:48:00.000Z	wols_	cox377	a ton of webservers on the internet run on linux
2007-05-31T13:48:00.000Z	wols_	cox377	so there's a lot of work done with it
