2010-02-05T17:57:00.000Z	memetic		Do I need to use the Ubuntu amd64 version to fully utilize the extra memory, or what?
2010-02-05T17:57:00.000Z	memetic		I don't suppose I can 'upgrade' to the 64-bit version, can I?
2010-02-05T17:58:00.000Z	memetic		Should I not have at least 4gb available right now?
2010-02-05T17:58:00.000Z	memetic		Instead of 2.7?
2010-02-05T17:58:00.000Z	memetic		Hmm.
2010-02-05T17:59:00.000Z	memetic		So cat /proc/meminfo and free -m report 2.7GB, and the other 1.3 is used for other stuff?
2010-02-05T17:59:00.000Z	memetic		Oh.
2010-02-05T17:59:00.000Z	memetic		Ok
2010-02-05T17:59:00.000Z	memetic		Weeell.
2010-02-05T17:59:00.000Z	memetic		If I reinstall, will I keep my data if I don't reformat?
2010-02-05T17:59:00.000Z	Slart	memetic	it's not used, but not addressable
2010-02-05T17:57:00.000Z	Slart	memetic	you can either use PAE or go 64bit.. I would recommend the later
2010-02-05T17:58:00.000Z	Slart	memetic	nope.. you're looking at a reinstall
2010-02-05T17:58:00.000Z	Slart	memetic	some of it is used for hardware mapping and other stuff
2010-02-05T17:59:00.000Z	Slart	memetic	usually you end up with something like 3 GB.
2010-02-05T17:59:00.000Z	Slart	memetic	but it differs depending on what hardware you have installed
2010-02-05T18:01:00.000Z	Slart	memetic	I would suggest you backup your data.. I think it will still be there after a reinstall.. but I'm not sure and things might go wrong on the way.. backups are good
2010-02-05T18:01:00.000Z	memetic	Slart	I certainly will!
2010-02-05T18:03:00.000Z	Slart	memetic	hmm.. xeon.. try the live cd first.. not sure if you want AMD64 or X86_64
2010-02-05T18:06:00.000Z	memetic	Slart	n00p, thank you for your help.  I'll create my rsync'd backups to my other systems and upgrade this puppy.
2010-02-05T18:07:00.000Z	Slart	memetic	good luck
