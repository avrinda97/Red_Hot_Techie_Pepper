2004-11-23T17:44:00.000Z	Hikaru79		Just a data cd
2004-11-23T17:45:00.000Z	Hikaru79		Well, I know i can just copy the files to the new CD and then burn
2004-11-23T17:45:00.000Z	Hikaru79		But if it's a software that has to be installed, etc., is that enough?
2004-11-23T17:47:00.000Z	Hikaru79		Windows software, actually
2004-11-23T17:47:00.000Z	Hikaru79		Just two CD's with a Windows program'
2004-11-23T17:47:00.000Z	Hikaru79		Oh, OK
2004-11-23T17:47:00.000Z	Hikaru79		=) Then that's enough
2004-11-23T16:22:00.000Z	Hikaru79		I just bought a DVD Writer (HP DVD Writer dvd630i)... can it be run on Linux? Is there a linux driver for it?
2004-11-23T16:23:00.000Z	Hikaru79		I have to install the driver first
2004-11-23T16:23:00.000Z	Hikaru79		But the CD they give is Windows-only
2004-11-23T16:23:00.000Z	socomm	Hikaru79	most vendors don't provide GNU/Linux drivers.
2004-11-23T16:24:00.000Z	Hikaru79	socomm	does that mean that there AREN'T any, or that you just have to find ones made independently from the vendor?
2004-11-23T16:24:00.000Z	Hikaru79		So there's a chance it'll work without any driver that I have to install personally?
2004-11-23T16:24:00.000Z	socomm	Hikaru79	no it just means that they don't support GNU/Linux, but GNU/Linux may have a driver for it though.
2004-11-23T16:25:00.000Z	Hikaru79		Sweet =D
2004-11-23T16:25:00.000Z	Hikaru79	socomm	or tolstoy, any ideas on where I might find drivers on the net?
2004-11-23T16:25:00.000Z	Hikaru79		I've tried, corbob
2004-11-23T16:25:00.000Z	socomm	Hikaru79	http://www.google.com/linux
2004-11-23T16:26:00.000Z	Hikaru79	socomm	I ran 'dvd630i' through that engine and I get nothing
2004-11-23T16:26:00.000Z	socomm	Hikaru79	usually you can just drop the drive into your machine and ubuntu will load up the appropriate kernel module for you.
2004-11-23T16:26:00.000Z	socomm	Hikaru79	have you tried that?
