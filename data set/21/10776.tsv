2005-03-31T06:47:00.000Z	iLLf8d		this the general question channel for ubuntu? I've got some feature/debian vs ubuntu difference questions
2005-03-31T06:47:00.000Z	iLLf8d		?
2005-03-31T06:49:00.000Z	iLLf8d		is there an ubuntu noob channel somewhere?
2005-03-31T06:50:00.000Z	iLLf8d		I'm running debian atm I got a few questions about ubuntus enhancements vs standard gnome/kde canned install. What enhancements are added to the environs (mimetypes, fileassociations etc?)
2005-03-31T06:50:00.000Z	Burgundavia	iLLf8d	generally, an attempt is made at chosing a bestofbreed program, rather than several programs
2005-03-31T06:50:00.000Z	Burgundavia	iLLf8d	ubuntu also follows gnome very closely
2005-03-31T06:51:00.000Z	Burgundavia	iLLf8d	in fact, we have totem in since warty
2005-03-31T06:51:00.000Z	iLLf8d	Burgundavia	ah uhm does it give you the ability to tweak the best of breeds to another app and still maintain mimeish type stuffs and the like
2005-03-31T06:51:00.000Z	Burgundavia	iLLf8d	you can install other apps yes
2005-03-31T06:53:00.000Z	Burgundavia	iLLf8d	ubuntu has very little in custom stuff. There is a big pressure, and a good one, to push everything good that we do upstream
2005-03-31T06:53:00.000Z	Burgundavia	iLLf8d	Mark Shuttleworth, in a lug radio interview, called in the distro upstreams will love
2005-03-31T06:54:00.000Z	Burgundavia	iLLf8d	in addition, most of debian in is universe if it is not already in main
2005-09-03T07:55:00.000Z	Burgundavia	iLLf8d	what does it switch with a mouse scroll?
2005-09-03T07:57:00.000Z	Burgundavia	iLLf8d	if you scroll on the workspace switcher (which is part of the panel), then switch workspaces
2005-09-03T07:59:00.000Z	iLLf8d	Burgundavia	hrm i'll have to throw ubuntu on a spare box and check it out, last time I used metacity wheel switching wasn't working as I'd hoped or at all, perhaps thats changed
2005-09-03T08:00:00.000Z	Burgundavia	iLLf8d	the workspace thing is not metacity.
2005-09-03T08:00:00.000Z	Burgundavia	iLLf8d	likely it was X not configuring your mouse with scrolling
2005-09-03T08:00:00.000Z	iLLf8d	Burgundavia	no it was metacity
2005-09-03T08:01:00.000Z	iLLf8d	Burgundavia	mouse wheel switching works fine and has for some time in other wms but like I said maybe newer code has a feature that it may not have in the past
2005-09-03T08:01:00.000Z	iLLf8d	Burgundavia	you mentioned it'll wheel on the switcher applet does it work on the bg or unfocused environ too?
2005-09-03T08:02:00.000Z	iLLf8d	Burgundavia	i'm not sure of its current capabilities
