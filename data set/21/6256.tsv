2007-04-30T06:08:00.000Z	redd_	zeroday	I'm not sure. glxinfo says there's no direct rendering
2007-04-30T06:08:00.000Z	zeroday	redd_	did you configure the driver?
2007-04-30T06:09:00.000Z	zeroday	redd_	did you run sudo aticonfig --initial then sudo aticonfig --overlay-type=Xv

2007-04-30T06:15:00.000Z	zeroday	redd_	apologies but can you try to reinstall the driver with the envy script (IMPORTANT - use envy to remove the old driver first)
