2009-01-14T01:05:00.000Z	fyrmedic		anyone know why grub doesn
2009-01-14T01:06:00.000Z	fyrmedic		oops,,, Anyone had experience with ubiquity failing at the install of grub. I am trying to install on an Acer Aspire One.
2009-01-14T01:07:00.000Z	pyrokay	fyrmedic	i have that laptop. try validating the install cd at boot
2009-01-14T01:08:00.000Z	fyrmedic	pyrokay	I am trying to do the install from a live usb created with unetbootin. I am going to download another iso and try re-creating the usb stick.
2009-01-14T01:08:00.000Z	pyrokay	fyrmedic	you can check the media at boot
2009-01-14T01:09:00.000Z	pyrokay	fyrmedic	but i used the standard installer + madwifi, works alright
2009-01-14T01:10:00.000Z	fyrmedic	pyrokay	I didn't see that option on the usb startup. The only options I saw were "default" "help" and "manufacturer"
2009-01-14T01:10:00.000Z	pyrokay	fyrmedic	sorry, i was thinking of a different boot cd
2009-01-14T01:11:00.000Z	fyrmedic	pyrokay	no worries. How did you do the madwifi? Was that after the successful install?
2009-01-14T01:11:00.000Z	pyrokay	fyrmedic	i just compiled and installed, would you ike my madwfi installer script?
2009-01-14T01:13:00.000Z	pyrokay	fyrmedic	alright, well, it boots from usb alright, and everything else works :)
2009-01-14T01:14:00.000Z	fyrmedic	pyrokay	Ok sure I'll give it a shot. Thanks.
2009-01-14T01:18:00.000Z	fyrmedic	pyrokay	I'll give it a shot if you have it set up.
2009-01-14T01:50:00.000Z	fyrmedic	pyrokay	I just changed iso's and the 8.04 has an integrity check that the 8.10 that I had previously didn't. I think I had a corrupted image.
2009-01-14T01:50:00.000Z	pyrokay	fyrmedic	excellent.
2009-01-14T01:50:00.000Z	pyrokay	fyrmedic	also, having access to wired ethernet makes thiing a lot easier  :)
2009-01-14T01:51:00.000Z	fyrmedic	pyrokay	doing the install process now. When you installed to your netbook how did you partition it? And I have net access.
2009-01-14T01:52:00.000Z	pyrokay	fyrmedic	personally i resized acers partition to 100Gb, gave ubuntu 15, and set acer's 100gb as /home/.
2009-01-14T01:53:00.000Z	fyrmedic	pyrokay	oh ok, I am using the ssd model. I suppose I will give ubuntu 8 on the fixed drive and /home on the removable drive.
2009-01-14T01:53:00.000Z	pyrokay	fyrmedic	ok.
