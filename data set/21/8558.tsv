2008-05-03T04:55:00.000Z	tessa	Scunizi	 ..I installed the server version, and it will have been the gneom version is there was a choice
2008-05-03T04:55:00.000Z	Scunizi	tessa	nope.. it's not.. you have to install it yourself with sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop or ubuntu-desktop

2008-05-03T04:57:00.000Z	Scunizi	tessa	with 32bit server.. probably not
2008-05-03T04:57:00.000Z	tessa	Scunizi	 ..are you telling me that the 64 bit server is liley to have a problem ?
2008-05-03T04:58:00.000Z	Scunizi	tessa	no.. It's just that if you have no 64 bit experience don't use it.. most programs are compiled for the 32bit environment and not all will work in 64 bit without some tweeking.
2008-05-03T04:59:00.000Z	Scunizi	tessa	if you're use to that then go for it..
