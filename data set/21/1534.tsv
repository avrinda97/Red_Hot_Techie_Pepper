2010-08-12T14:46:00.000Z	ilyekkakai		Why can't I get the changes I make to this mp3 file's tags "stick" in Rhythmbox? The file permissions are set to read & write... it is only 2 files out of a group of 16 that are giving me this issue - all the others stayed changed when I edited their tags. I don't see how these two are any different. It is driving me crazy.. aaaarrgghh!!
2010-08-12T14:47:00.000Z	Slart	ilyekkakai	can you pastebin the output of ls -la in the folder where the mp3's are?
2010-08-12T14:55:00.000Z	ilyekkakai	Slart	here is the output - as you can see all permissions are the same - http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/VckRDkJu - (sorry I keep getting disconnected from the internet, my connection is being suck)
2010-08-12T14:56:00.000Z	Slart	ilyekkakai	and which files are giving you problems?
2010-08-12T14:57:00.000Z	ilyekkakai	Slart	track 15 and track 16 only.
2010-08-12T14:58:00.000Z	ilyekkakai	Slart	I mean, number 18 and 19 in the pastebin
2010-08-12T14:58:00.000Z	Slart	ilyekkakai	hmm..not 11, 12 ? the only two with ' in the titles?
2010-08-12T14:59:00.000Z	Slart	ilyekkakai	ok.. they look like the rest to me.. strange.. have you tried running rhythmbox from a terminal just to see if it prints out any kind of error message when you try changing the tags?
2010-08-12T14:59:00.000Z	ilyekkakai	Slart	nope
2010-08-12T14:59:00.000Z	ilyekkakai	Slart	no.
2010-08-12T14:59:00.000Z	Slart	ilyekkakai	if that doesn't work I would try another tag editor.. easytag is quite ok imho
2010-08-12T15:01:00.000Z	ilyekkakai	Slart	ok I will see if Rhythmbox spits anything out into the terminal, then I will look into other methods of retagging...
2010-08-12T15:03:00.000Z	ilyekkakai	Slart	nothing unusual happened in terminal... All I am trying to do is change a word from all uppercase to lowercase...
2010-08-12T15:04:00.000Z	Slart	ilyekkakai	well.. give easytag a go.. see if can do it
2010-08-12T15:05:00.000Z	ilyekkakai	Slart	it is weird, because it looks like it has worked when I do it in Rhythmbox, then exactly 3 seconds later, it reverts back to the old uppercase version.
2010-08-12T15:07:00.000Z	Slart	ilyekkakai	I've never had that happen to me.. although I've never used rhythmbox so it might be some kind of bug/feature ..
2010-08-12T15:16:00.000Z	ilyekkakai	Slart	I have dicovered something even more bizarre.. those two files, now say the correct tags when viewed in easytag, but when opened in Rhythmbox, they have reverted to the old tags....
2010-08-12T15:17:00.000Z	Slart	ilyekkakai	perhaps one of the programs is using v1 and the other one is using v2 of the id3 tagging system?
2010-08-12T15:18:00.000Z	Slart	ilyekkakai	oh.. ask ilovefairuz just said.. =)
2010-08-12T15:21:00.000Z	ilyekkakai	Slart	ilovefairuz - well according to the prefs in easytag, it is set to write both ID3v1 and ID3v2 tags by default.... so I can't work out why RB is still showing up the old tags....
2010-08-12T15:22:00.000Z	Slart	ilyekkakai	perhaps it's got the tags cached so it doesn't need to read them every time it boots up.. isn't there a "refresh my music library" option? perhaps rename the file slightly so it thinks it's a new file?
