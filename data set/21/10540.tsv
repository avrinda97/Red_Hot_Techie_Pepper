2005-02-28T10:25:00.000Z	mebaran151	hawke	I think most do
2005-02-28T10:25:00.000Z	hawke	mebaran151	Could be, I don't have much experience with ide raid
2005-02-28T10:31:00.000Z	hawke	mebaran151	Yeah you have, if you use ubuntu...it's the default gnome window manager.
2005-02-28T10:32:00.000Z	hawke	mebaran151	No, nautilus is a file manager.
2005-02-28T10:32:00.000Z	mebaran151	hawke	yeah
2005-02-28T10:32:00.000Z	hawke	mebaran151	metacity is the program that draws the window borders and close/min/max buttons.
2005-02-28T10:33:00.000Z	hawke	mebaran151	sawfish
2005-02-28T10:33:00.000Z	hawke	mebaran151	I like it better, it's way more configurable.
2005-02-28T10:33:00.000Z	hawke	mebaran151	visually it's the same.
2005-02-28T10:34:00.000Z	hawke	mebaran151	if you like functionality, sawfish has it...it's insanely configurable.
2005-02-28T10:34:00.000Z	hawke	mebaran151	yeah.
2005-02-28T10:34:00.000Z	hawke	mebaran151	oh, no
2005-02-28T10:34:00.000Z	hawke	mebaran151	Just 'killall metacity' until it stops respawning, run 'sawfish &', and then run gnome-session-save
2005-02-28T10:35:00.000Z	hawke	mebaran151	unfortunately, no clean way to change window managers, at least that I know of.
2005-02-28T10:39:00.000Z	hawke	mebaran151	'ps auxww | grep sawfish'
2005-02-28T10:39:00.000Z	hawke	mebaran151	and 'ps auxww | grep metacity'
2005-02-28T10:40:00.000Z	hawke	mebaran151	now system -> preferences -> windows should give you the sawfish config
2005-02-28T10:41:00.000Z	hawke	mebaran151	There should be a bunch of things...
2005-02-28T10:41:00.000Z	hawke	mebaran151	is the window called "sawfish configurator"
2005-02-28T10:42:00.000Z	hawke	mebaran151	?
2005-02-28T10:43:00.000Z	hawke	mebaran151	there may be arrows next to the tabs to scroll left and right
