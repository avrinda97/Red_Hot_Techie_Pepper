2007-12-17T06:05:00.000Z	Pelo	brophat	waste of space,  you only need 5-10 gig to run / on , and only 2x ram for /swap,
2007-12-17T06:07:00.000Z	Pelo	brophat	 I have 2 hdd also , hdd 1 is 10 gig for windows , the rest for a download folder (70 gig ) ,  hdd2  10 gig / , 2 gig /swap and 60 gig for /home
2007-12-17T06:09:00.000Z	Pelo	brophat	you can'gt run linux with just one partiton, you need a partition for swap , but yes you can have a partition over two hdd
2007-12-17T06:09:00.000Z	brophat	Pelo	please, you know what I mean
2007-12-17T06:09:00.000Z	Pelo	brophat	I do know and I gave you a links for raid and lvm
2007-12-17T06:11:00.000Z	Pelo	brophat	/ and everthing else is only the mount point partitons don'T have names
2007-12-17T06:15:00.000Z	Pelo	brophat	I tink yo are wasting hdd space with 80 gig for / and swap but have fun
2007-12-17T06:15:00.000Z	brophat	Pelo	what are my options? just the raid solution?
2007-12-17T06:17:00.000Z	Pelo	brophat	presonnaly,  I would make a seperate partition on your 80 gig hdd for /home and then make your 120 gig hdd one partiton for other stuff,  you can set the mount point for that partiton in your /home folder if you want,  use that part for game or video or downloads or what ever you want
2007-12-17T06:17:00.000Z	brophat	Pelo	good idea
2007-12-17T06:18:00.000Z	brophat	Pelo	I will call it My Documents

2007-12-17T06:21:00.000Z	Pelo	brophat	ok , just checking
2007-12-17T06:21:00.000Z	brophat	Pelo	you know what it is is that this stuff comes up so infrequent that it is hard to remember stuff that I once undertood like a year ago
2007-12-17T06:22:00.000Z	Pelo	brophat	it's also difficult to evaluate the level of expertise of the ppl asking question, and even then , ppl are experts on some stuff and totaly useless with other things
2007-12-17T06:23:00.000Z	brophat	Pelo	I totally understand
2007-12-17T06:23:00.000Z	brophat	Pelo	i have pockets of knowledge
