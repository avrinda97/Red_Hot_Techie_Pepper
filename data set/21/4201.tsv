2008-08-02T03:09:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot		no firefox 3.0 in ubuntu 7.10 repos? i got with apt-get install firefox-3.0 something called gran paradiso (firefox alpha8)
2008-08-02T03:09:00.000Z	Flannel	DIFH-iceroot	the backports will probably get upgraded eventually.  but no.
2008-08-02T03:09:00.000Z	Flannel	DIFH-iceroot	backports has beta...3? I think.
2008-08-02T03:10:00.000Z	Flannel	DIFH-iceroot	because 7.10 was released with firefox 2.  Firefox 3 will never be in the main repos, but might be backported
2008-08-15T14:50:00.000Z	Flannel	DIFH-iceroot	No need for that
2008-09-06T05:22:00.000Z	Flannel	DIFH-iceroot	no.
2008-09-07T12:47:00.000Z	Flannel	DIFH-iceroot	sudo apt-get clean
2008-09-07T12:47:00.000Z	Flannel	DIFH-iceroot	that'll clear it for you.
2008-09-07T12:48:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	Flannel	for what is it? and can i disable this?
2008-09-07T12:48:00.000Z	Flannel	DIFH-iceroot	and yes, you can automatically have to clean itself out, in apt.conf
2008-09-07T12:48:00.000Z	Flannel	DIFH-iceroot	its your cache for apt.  apt downloads files, then installs them from the local thing, and doesn't delete them (in case you reinstall later)
2008-09-07T12:48:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	Flannel	ok thanks
2008-09-07T12:48:00.000Z	Flannel	DIFH-iceroot	You can disable it (or at least, have it clear often) through apt.conf
2008-09-07T12:49:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	Flannel	ok i will do, thank you
2008-09-07T13:27:00.000Z	Flannel	DIFH-iceroot	you're welcome to do that, but please don't recommend it here.
2009-01-21T03:55:00.000Z	Flannel	DIFH-iceroot	You have to compile, then run it.  There's no way to do it all in a single command.  (Unless your single command is gcc -o test test.c && ./test)
2009-01-21T03:57:00.000Z	Flannel	DIFH-iceroot	First kdevelop compiles (if needed), then runs it
2009-01-21T03:57:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	Flannel	so kdevelop is using something like gcc -o test test.c && ./test
2009-01-21T03:58:00.000Z	Flannel	DIFH-iceroot	For our purposes, yes.
2009-03-15T03:47:00.000Z	Flannel	DIFH-iceroot	gpryatel_: sudo apt-get install openssh-server
2009-03-15T03:47:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	Flannel	ah sorry for the wrong name
