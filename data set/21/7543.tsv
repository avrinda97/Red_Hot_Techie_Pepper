2006-09-21T15:08:00.000Z	Zolace		Hey
2006-09-21T15:09:00.000Z	Zolace		I think we all have questions hehe
2006-09-21T15:09:00.000Z	Zolace		Something quite trivial for me, about GAIM
2006-09-21T15:09:00.000Z	Zolace		Actually a couple of things
2006-09-21T15:10:00.000Z	Zolace		I have two questions. 1, On X chat, is there any way to have a list of users at the side of the screen like on normal IRC? And also on GAIM what does it mean if your contact has an red X next to their icon?
2006-09-21T15:11:00.000Z	magnet	Zolace	if you don't have the userlist, you're using xchat-gnome; revert to xchat (sudo apt-get install xchat)
2006-09-21T15:11:00.000Z	magnet	Zolace	the X means that you're not in his contact list
2006-09-21T15:12:00.000Z	magnet	Zolace	must not be the same X then ;)
2006-09-21T15:12:00.000Z	magnet	Zolace	it depends on the protocol anyway
2006-09-21T15:14:00.000Z	magnet	Zolace	yes it is ;)
2006-09-21T15:14:00.000Z	magnet	Zolace	sudo apt-get install xchat
2006-09-21T15:15:00.000Z	magnet	Zolace	run the command I told you in a terminal window
2006-09-21T15:15:00.000Z	magnet	Zolace	well, it *is* in universe/net
2006-09-21T15:16:00.000Z	magnet	Zolace	wait
2006-09-21T15:16:00.000Z	magnet	Zolace	have you enabled the different channels? (in sources.list or menu "Software channels") ?
2006-09-21T15:17:00.000Z	magnet	Zolace	edit the /etc/apt/sources.list file (sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list) and remove the hashes (#) in front of the "deb" and "deb-src" lines
2006-09-21T15:18:00.000Z	magnet	Zolace	then run sudo apt-get update, and again sudo apt-get install xchat
2006-09-21T15:19:00.000Z	magnet	Zolace	even after sudo apt-get update ?
2006-09-21T15:21:00.000Z	magnet	Zolace	yep you must remove the hashes of all of them
2006-09-21T15:24:00.000Z	magnet	Zolace	you must still miss some repositories
2006-09-21T15:24:00.000Z	magnet	Zolace	xchat is definitely available in the universe
