2009-03-17T05:03:00.000Z	Akkernight		No, it's not pointless, this is a windows project, I just wanna use Ubuntu, now stop thinking about why, and think how, so how do I do this?
2009-03-17T05:05:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Akkernight	Do you want to cross-compile for Windows, or build a multi-platform app?
2009-03-17T05:06:00.000Z	Akkernight	IntuitiveNipple	cross-compile I guess... My project can't find windows.h, and I want it to find it so that I can compile (forgot to add the name)
2009-03-17T05:06:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Akkernight	you'd use mingw
2009-03-17T05:07:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Akkernight	the MINimalistic Gnu c compiler for Windows
2009-03-17T05:09:00.000Z	Akkernight	IntuitiveNipple	where do I get this?
2009-03-17T05:09:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Akkernight	If you're using Code:Blocks there's tutorials in their forums
2009-03-17T05:09:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Akkernight	looks like their site is down right now... say thanks to the Google cache: http://209.85.229.132/search?q=cache:NdNxupurZgwJ:forums.codeblocks.org/index.php%3Ftopic%3D3343.0+code:blocks+cross+compile&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=uk&client=firefox-a
2009-03-17T05:10:00.000Z	Akkernight	IntuitiveNipple	ok thanks!
2009-03-17T06:04:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Akkernight	If you're in hurry maybe you should read the instructions I gave you earlier, and check out the mingw site as per the link it provides
2009-03-17T06:05:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Akkernight	So explore the Sourceforge project downloads lists until you find it then!
2009-03-17T06:06:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Akkernight	If I can find it in 30 seconds as I did, I'm sure you can!
2009-03-17T06:07:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Akkernight	http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435&package_id=82725&release_id=358837
2009-03-17T06:07:00.000Z	Akkernight	IntuitiveNipple	... You knew what you were looking for, right? xP
2009-03-17T06:08:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Akkernight	No. I've never looked at that before, I just used my brain!
2009-03-17T06:08:00.000Z	Akkernight	IntuitiveNipple	I have no brain... xP Seriously, I tried finding it, waited 20 mins to download the wrong thing too -.-
2009-03-17T06:22:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Akkernight	not sure, but that looks like a library class constant
2009-03-17T06:23:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Akkernight	I'll be following you shortly. Just started writing a cross-platform app for webcam/video/audio/text over P2P and it has to work on Linux/Windows/OSX :)
2009-03-17T06:25:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Akkernight	Yes, distributed multiuser conferencing and streaming
2009-03-17T06:36:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Akkernight	Press Ctrl+C to interrupt it, make handles signals
2009-03-17T06:38:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Akkernight	probably missing dependencies
