2007-12-14T03:32:00.000Z	lenorek		Hi everyone, I get this error when I put DVDs or CDs in my computer "Unable to mount the selected volume...[CD/DVD name]  mount: Not a directory"... I am using Gutsy. Can someone help me please
2007-12-14T03:33:00.000Z	wraund	lenorek	a recent dvd player?
2007-12-14T03:34:00.000Z	lenorek	wraund	it is a very new dell machine
2007-12-14T03:36:00.000Z	lenorek	wraund	I have already installed multimedia codecs... there is no difference. I still get the same error
2007-12-14T03:36:00.000Z	wraund	lenorek	posibly dodgy interface from drive to motherboard
2007-12-14T03:36:00.000Z	wraund	lenorek	did it work on windows or a previous OS?
2007-12-14T03:37:00.000Z	lenorek	wraund	I installed Ubuntu as soon as I got the machine. So I don't know whether it worked on Windows
2007-12-14T03:37:00.000Z	wraund	lenorek	possibly a bad connection
2007-12-14T03:37:00.000Z	wraund	lenorek	or a dodgy drive
2007-12-14T03:37:00.000Z	lenorek	wraund	How can I fix a bad connection?
2007-12-14T03:38:00.000Z	wraund	lenorek	wellim not saying it is, but if it was, take the side of the machine and check
2007-12-14T03:38:00.000Z	lenorek	wraund	so I just make sure the plugs are in properly
2007-12-14T03:38:00.000Z	lenorek	wraund	?
2007-12-14T03:38:00.000Z	wraund	lenorek	yeah
2007-12-14T03:38:00.000Z	wraund	lenorek	but to be honest i doubt it is that
2007-12-14T03:39:00.000Z	wraund	lenorek	possibly something to do with software
2007-12-14T03:39:00.000Z	wraund	lenorek	people have had the eror before, google it
2007-12-14T03:39:00.000Z	lenorek	wraund	I did google it. This one guy on the forums had the problem and it went away. No one really offered an answer to him
2007-12-14T03:40:00.000Z	wraund	lenorek	:( sorry mate i cant help anymore, sleepy time
2007-12-14T03:40:00.000Z	wraund	lenorek	ask someone else :P
2007-12-14T03:40:00.000Z	lenorek	wraund	thanks anyway
