2009-11-25T14:53:00.000Z	Mimsy		I've been banging my head against the wall this morning but I solved my problem
2009-11-25T14:54:00.000Z	Mimsy		Virtualbox didn't uninstall cleanly and the Kernel Modules were slowing down the system
2009-11-25T14:55:00.000Z	Mimsy		hehe
2009-11-25T14:57:00.000Z	Mimsy		I do have a support question actually...
2009-11-25T14:57:00.000Z	Mimsy		When I upgraded to Ubuntu 9.10 my Console text got Really Tiny
2009-11-25T14:57:00.000Z	Mimsy		I would like to fix that
2009-11-25T14:57:00.000Z	Mimsy		yes the text is almost unreadable
2009-11-25T14:57:00.000Z	Mimsy		for me
2009-11-25T14:58:00.000Z	Mimsy		Not X, the Console (CLI)
2009-11-25T14:58:00.000Z	Slart	Mimsy	I'm not sure if that is still set by grub when using the new grub 2  but in grub 1 that was set on the grub boot line by specifying things like VGA=791 and so on
2009-11-25T14:58:00.000Z	Mimsy	Slart	I tried that, when it gets so far, the font changes to a tiny font
2009-11-25T14:59:00.000Z	Slart	Mimsy	tried changing that number to something else? there are lists of different VGA resolution mode numbers available
2009-11-25T15:00:00.000Z	Mimsy	Slart	yes and no matter what the line is, the boot process goes so far then flash, something is loaded that says to run a tiny font.
2009-11-25T15:01:00.000Z	Slart	Mimsy	hmmm.. not sure what that might be.. is this an fresh install of 9.10 or an updated 9.04?
2009-11-25T15:03:00.000Z	Mimsy	Slart	Upgraded from 9.04 -> 9.10
2009-11-25T15:04:00.000Z	Slart	Mimsy	I wonder if it's something you installed on 9.04.. I know there is a terminus console font package that you can install.. have you tried searching in synaptic for console font.. see if anything suspicius is installed?
2009-11-25T15:05:00.000Z	Mimsy	Slart	I will do that right now
2009-11-25T15:09:00.000Z	Mimsy	Slart	I think I figured it out, there is a file called /etc/default/console-setup where the fonts are chosen for the console
2009-11-25T15:10:00.000Z	Slart	Mimsy	ah.. good hunting..
2009-11-25T15:10:00.000Z	Mimsy	Slart	thank you so much
2009-11-25T15:29:00.000Z	Mimsy	Slart	Thank you so much for your help, i found the utility to change console fonts - setupcon *hug*
