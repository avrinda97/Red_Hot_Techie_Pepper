2009-11-02T08:40:00.000Z	blaz_		Did anyone try to switch off subpixel hinting in Karmic?
2009-11-02T08:41:00.000Z	hurd	blaz_	its possible
2009-11-02T08:41:00.000Z	hurd	blaz_	are you using gnome or kde
2009-11-02T08:41:00.000Z	blaz_	hurd	neither, im editing fontconfig fikles
2009-11-02T08:41:00.000Z	blaz_	hurd	*files
2009-11-02T08:42:00.000Z	hurd	blaz_	well its going to work in X only, so im asuming you are going to use a wm?
2009-11-02T08:42:00.000Z	blaz_	hurd	it is openbox currently
2009-11-02T08:47:00.000Z	blaz_	hurd	but does it work in gnome/kde? i tried to set 'rgba' option in .fonts.conf but doesn't work. I guess gnome/kde gui tools do something similar..
2009-11-02T08:48:00.000Z	hurd	blaz_	do ls /etc/fonts/conf.avail, youll find the answer there
2009-11-02T08:50:00.000Z	blaz_	hurd	i tried to symlink the 10-no-sub-pixel.conf but it doesn't work. I think theres a bug in Karmic fontconfig or something..
2009-11-02T08:51:00.000Z	hurd	blaz_	what does ls -l /etc/fonts/conf.d/10-no-sub-pixel.conf say
2009-11-02T08:51:00.000Z	blaz_	hurd	do you have subpixel hinting switched off and antialiasing on for your desktop?
2009-11-02T08:51:00.000Z	hurd	blaz_	i have subpixel off
2009-11-02T08:51:00.000Z	hurd	blaz_	you need to restart X after doing it
2009-11-02T08:52:00.000Z	blaz_	hurd	it says <edit name="rgba" mode="assign"><const>none</const></edit>, what's your point?
2009-11-02T08:52:00.000Z	hurd	blaz_	what does ls -l /etc/fonts/conf.d/10-no-sub-pixel.conf say
2009-11-02T08:53:00.000Z	blaz_	hurd	oh sorry.. it says /etc/fonts/conf.d/10-no-sub-pixel.conf -> ../conf.avail/10-no-sub-pixel.conf
2009-11-02T08:54:00.000Z	blaz_	hurd	did you look at your fonts with xmag and don't see colorful pixels?
2009-11-02T08:54:00.000Z	hurd	blaz_	that depends on the font, some dont work well with it switched off
2009-11-02T08:54:00.000Z	hurd	blaz_	everything is alright from what i can check, as long as youve tried restarting x
2009-11-02T08:56:00.000Z	blaz_	hurd	ok, i hope it will work after restart, thanks!
