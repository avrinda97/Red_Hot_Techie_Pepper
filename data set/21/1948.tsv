2010-03-04T22:07:00.000Z	LostKarmic		Hello
2010-03-04T22:08:00.000Z	LostKarmic		I have a fresh installation of Ubuntu 9.10 (karmic)
2010-03-04T22:08:00.000Z	LostKarmic		my problem is that I can't install most of the packages like proftpd, proftpd-basic or php5-mcrypt
2010-03-04T22:08:00.000Z	LostKarmic		E: Package proftpd has no installation candidate
2010-03-04T22:08:00.000Z	LostKarmic		replace proftpd whatever package name
2010-03-04T22:09:00.000Z	LostKarmic		I added universe and multiver to apt source list
2010-03-04T22:09:00.000Z	LostKarmic		didn't work
2010-03-04T22:10:00.000Z	lucid_interval	LostKarmic	_usually_ the message "Package xxx has no installation candidate" means that the package name has changed
2010-03-04T22:10:00.000Z	LostKarmic	lucid_interval	I also tryed to search for packages with aptitude but no proftpd nor php5-mcrypt :(
2010-03-04T22:11:00.000Z	lucid_interval	LostKarmic	did you try proftpd-basic? that seems to be there (at least in Lucid)
2010-03-04T22:12:00.000Z	LostKarmic	lucid_interval	No candidate version found for proftpd-basic    I also tryed proftpd-mysql-mod orsomething.. none works
2010-03-04T22:15:00.000Z	LostKarmic	lucid_interval	yes, but I can do it again :)
2010-03-04T22:16:00.000Z	lucid_interval	LostKarmic	BTW, proftpd is in universe - so make sure you have enabled the universe repository under software sources before you do the apt-get update
2010-03-04T22:17:00.000Z	LostKarmic	lucid_interval	 deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ karmic universe  this right?
2010-03-04T22:17:00.000Z	lucid_interval	LostKarmic	yes
2010-03-04T22:18:00.000Z	LostKarmic	lucid_interval	yep, everything uncommented, apt-get updated.. still nothing :(
2010-03-04T22:19:00.000Z	lucid_interval	LostKarmic	:-( last thing I can think of is do an apt-get -f install (fix any dependencies). Otherwise out of ideas.
2010-03-04T22:21:00.000Z	lucid_interval	LostKarmic	can you paste the output of: apt-cache policy proftpd-basic
2010-03-04T22:21:00.000Z	lucid_interval	LostKarmic	just the stuff after the ':'
2010-03-04T22:35:00.000Z	lucid_interval	LostKarmic	Glad you got it fixed.
2010-03-04T22:35:00.000Z	LostKarmic	lucid_interval	Thank you for your time! :)
