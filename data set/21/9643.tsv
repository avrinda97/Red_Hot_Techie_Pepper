2006-08-07T10:38:00.000Z	ToRTuReD_X		woo you're a life saver jrattner1
2006-08-07T10:39:00.000Z	ToRTuReD_X	jrattner1	any ideas on making my permissions read/write on an ntfs disk?
2006-08-07T10:39:00.000Z	jrattner1	ToRTuReD_X	yeh i can point you in that direction but making NTFS writable is DANGEROUS
2006-08-07T10:40:00.000Z	jrattner1	ToRTuReD_X	but someone stable
2006-08-07T10:40:00.000Z	ToRTuReD_X		oh?
2006-08-07T10:40:00.000Z	ToRTuReD_X		how so?
2006-08-07T10:40:00.000Z	jrattner1	ToRTuReD_X	you could experience data corruptions, its safest to use NTFS as a read only file system unless u really need it to be writable
2006-08-07T10:40:00.000Z	jrattner1		compiz is fun
2006-08-07T10:41:00.000Z	ToRTuReD_X		oh ok
2006-08-07T10:41:00.000Z	jrattner1		compiz is awsome but unstable
2006-08-07T10:41:00.000Z	ToRTuReD_X		.. i can't take the disk out when using ubuntu live can i?
2006-08-07T10:41:00.000Z	jrattner1	ToRTuReD_X	nope : )
