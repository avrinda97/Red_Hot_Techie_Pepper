2007-07-14T05:00:00.000Z	jonathan_		what is the mean of tar-xvvf??
2007-07-14T05:00:00.000Z	jonathan_		I donno what it mean
2007-07-14T05:00:00.000Z	Enselic_	jonathan_	tar is a program
2007-07-14T16:59:00.000Z	Enselic_	jonathan_	 they are the same
2007-07-14T05:00:00.000Z	Enselic_	jonathan_	a tar file is simply a way of keeping many files in one file
2007-07-14T05:01:00.000Z	Enselic_	jonathan_	xvf are flags
2007-07-14T05:01:00.000Z	Enselic_	jonathan_	   flags are given with -
2007-07-14T05:01:00.000Z	Enselic_	jonathan_	so     tar   -z -x -v -f    give the tar program four flags      these flags can be put together, like this    tar -zxvf
2007-07-14T05:02:00.000Z	Enselic_	jonathan_	you usually also give a file to the tar program, like this    tar -zxvf somefile.tar.gz     which will make tar extract somefile.tar.gz
2007-07-14T05:02:00.000Z	Enselic_	jonathan_	for the details of what the different flags do (they are different for each program)   do man tar
2007-07-14T05:03:00.000Z	Enselic_	jonathan_	after you have issued that command, tar will extract the files
2007-07-14T05:03:00.000Z	Enselic_	jonathan_	a gzipped file is a file zipped with gzip
2007-07-14T05:03:00.000Z	Enselic_	jonathan_	just like a .zip file on windows
2007-07-14T05:05:00.000Z	Enselic_	jonathan_	if you don't want to use the command line, you can just doubleclick on a gzip file and Ubuntu will open up an extracter for you
