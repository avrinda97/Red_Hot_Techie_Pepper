2011-10-21T00:54:00.000Z	iceroot	reisio	have a look at "jude" which is a java-app for something like that
2011-10-21T00:54:00.000Z	iceroot	reisio	wrong nick
2011-10-23T17:39:00.000Z	iceroot	reisio	correct

2011-11-02T23:22:00.000Z	reisio	iceroot	virtualization is virtualization
2011-11-02T23:22:00.000Z	iceroot	reisio	no

2011-11-02T23:22:00.000Z	iceroot	reisio	please read some basics about that topic, there are huge differences
2011-11-02T23:23:00.000Z	iceroot	reisio	specially for the speed of io-devices
2011-11-03T04:16:00.000Z	reisio	iceroot	y'know, except that you could get it for free...
2012-01-10T07:15:00.000Z	reisio	iceroot	instead of what?
2012-01-10T07:16:00.000Z	iceroot	reisio	ubuntu is the version with gnome/unity, ubuntu-server is the same version without gnome/unity
2012-01-10T07:17:00.000Z	iceroot	reisio	so installing the serveredition and then installing the gui is exactly the same as directly installing the ubuntu-version (ok server-edition is using pae as default but with 12.04 all will use pae as 32bit default kernel)
2012-01-10T07:17:00.000Z	reisio	iceroot	that isn't exactly accurate, but I agree it's silly to put a GUI on a server
2012-05-30T19:39:00.000Z	reisio	iceroot	yup
2012-05-30T19:40:00.000Z	iceroot	reisio	MonkeyDust thx
