2010-11-16T08:30:00.000Z	Tort		Can someone link me to a good howto for ssh?
2010-11-16T08:31:00.000Z	Tort		perhaps something that covers both
2010-11-16T08:31:00.000Z	Tort		or just both..
2010-11-16T08:31:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	Tort	across lan is super simple, install openssh  and you are good to go
2010-11-16T08:32:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	Tort	I use it all the time on lan
2010-11-16T08:32:00.000Z	Tort	ubuntu4shane	I was under the impression that you had to have a client installed on the second machine though?
2010-11-16T08:32:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	Tort	after that, on both machines, you can ssh user@ipaddress
2010-11-16T08:32:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	Tort	I'm 95% sure it is just openssh, but let me check
2010-11-16T08:33:00.000Z	Tort	ubuntu4shane	Maybe it only changes if you are ssh'ing into a machine with Windows?
2010-11-16T08:33:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	Tort	ohh, right, I only work with Linux boxes, very simple
2010-11-16T08:33:00.000Z	Tort	ubuntu4shane	okay that's fine, what about over www?
2010-11-16T08:34:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	Tort	never done that over www, that is a different ball game, because I assume you are going to need router configurations, and port forwarding etc.  gets complex
2010-11-16T08:34:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane		Tort on the other hand I have ssh access into my server, but they are a server. :)
2010-11-16T08:35:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	Tort	this is a little dated, but https://help.ubuntu.com/9.10/serverguide/C/openssh-server.html  should be fine
2010-11-16T08:35:00.000Z	Tort	ubuntu4shane	alright I'll check that out. Thanks
2010-11-16T08:36:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	Tort	I don't think you have to do all the configuration, just the two install commands at the top
2010-11-16T08:37:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	Tort	that being said there are all kinds of security additions that you can configure if you are paranoid, I did those for several years, and decided ahh, don't really live in a dangerous area. :)
2010-11-16T08:37:00.000Z	Tort	ubuntu4shane	what do most people use ssh for? I know what it does but I haven't heard of a practical use outside of system administration
2010-11-16T08:38:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	Tort	hmm, system admin. :)  I use it a lot to copy files from my cpu to the laptop
2010-11-16T08:39:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	Tort	mostly system admin, update a box I'm not setting at, I access my pc from laptop a lot for files, just laziness.
2010-11-16T08:39:00.000Z	Tort	ubuntu4shane	cool, I'm really lazy :P
