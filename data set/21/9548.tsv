2006-12-12T12:45:00.000Z	Trixsey		why does it take so much time packing programs for ubuntu? like.. repositories
2006-12-12T12:45:00.000Z	Trixsey		are weeks after real releases
2006-12-12T12:45:00.000Z	Trixsey		even big releases
2006-12-12T12:46:00.000Z	Stormx2	Trixsey	Um?
2006-12-12T12:46:00.000Z	Stormx2	Trixsey	Programs don't get released for ubuntu after releases. Not official ones.
2006-12-12T12:46:00.000Z	Stormx2	Trixsey	Its called feature freeze.
2006-12-12T12:46:00.000Z	Stormx2	Trixsey	So why don't you take it on yourself to install beta 5? I did...
2006-12-12T12:48:00.000Z	Stormx2	Trixsey	Ubuntu has a strict set of rules for what packages get though. Packaging GAIM in a reliable and bugfree state is tricky, they can't just scrap that process the moment a new version comes out a day before an ubuntu release.
2006-12-12T12:48:00.000Z	Stormx2	Trixsey	So get a new version?
2006-12-12T12:49:00.000Z	Stormx2	Trixsey	GAIM was stable & very bug free in dapper. If you wanted complete bug-free hand holding stay with dapper.
2006-12-12T12:50:00.000Z	Stormx2	Trixsey	Otherwise upgrade. Like I said.
2006-12-20T06:47:00.000Z	Stormx2	Trixsey	Huh?
2006-12-20T06:47:00.000Z	Stormx2	Trixsey	Commands are run like this: command
2006-12-20T06:48:00.000Z	Trixsey	Stormx2	you just run the commands from a .sh script?
2006-12-20T06:49:00.000Z	Stormx2	Trixsey	Yeah.
2006-12-20T06:49:00.000Z	Stormx2	Trixsey	Same as command line, amost.
2006-12-20T06:49:00.000Z	Trixsey	Stormx2	so this is OK? http://www.mathbin.net/2545
2006-12-20T06:50:00.000Z	Stormx2	Trixsey	Should be, try and see.
2006-12-20T06:50:00.000Z	Trixsey	Stormx2	why do they use & in the end in this script?
2006-12-20T06:51:00.000Z	Stormx2	Trixsey	& is for redirecting output I think.... I'm not sure. Ask the people in #bash, I never really was a good shell scripter
2006-12-20T06:52:00.000Z	Stormx2	Trixsey	Doesn't hold up everything
