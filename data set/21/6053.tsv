2007-06-11T15:22:00.000Z	jrib	SM7X	you are using hoary?
2007-06-11T15:22:00.000Z	SM7X	jrib	--> Ubuntu 5.04 "Hoary Hedgehog" \n \l
2007-06-11T15:23:00.000Z	jrib	SM7X	you should upgrade, hoary hasn't been supported for a while
2007-06-11T15:24:00.000Z	SM7X	jrib	so its no chance for me to get some packets?
2007-06-11T15:25:00.000Z	SM7X	jrib	this server is of a friend of mine and it has to run.. if i update i have to reinstall dont i?
2007-06-11T15:25:00.000Z	jrib	SM7X	no, you can upgrade
2007-06-11T15:26:00.000Z	SM7X	jrib	dont want to bother but... no way to get old packets for it?
2007-06-11T15:28:00.000Z	jrib	SM7X	well security updates aren't guaranteed anyway so you really should upgrade
2007-06-11T15:29:00.000Z	jrib	SM7X	you could also try a different mirror, maybe it's just that mirror
2007-06-11T15:30:00.000Z	SM7X	jrib	i allready tried 3
2007-06-11T15:31:00.000Z	jrib	SM7X	well, I would recommend upgrading, or at least trying a live cd to test things out
2007-06-11T15:32:00.000Z	SM7X	jrib	its a server in an RZ no way to get there and use a livecd
