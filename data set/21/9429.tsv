2005-12-27T09:30:00.000Z	psusi		of course it isn't... it doesn't crash half as much!
2005-12-27T09:31:00.000Z	psusi		the crashing alone makes windows clearly better ;)
2005-12-27T09:32:00.000Z	psusi		try totem-xine
2005-12-27T09:32:00.000Z	psusi		winamp, it really whips the lama's ass
2005-12-27T09:33:00.000Z	psusi		floopies are obsolete... burn them, and let them rest in pieces
2005-12-27T09:34:00.000Z	bobbyd	psusi	not true
2005-12-27T09:34:00.000Z	psusi	bobbyd	what is not true?
2005-12-27T09:35:00.000Z	bobbyd	psusi	rain_ , http://www.jankratochvil.net/project/captive/
2005-12-27T09:35:00.000Z	psusi	bobbyd	no thanks... I don't trust microsoft drivers under windows... trying to run them under linux is just insane ;)
2005-12-27T09:35:00.000Z	bobbyd	psusi	works just fine
2005-12-27T09:36:00.000Z	psusi	bobbyd	there is a reason why it isn't officially supported ;)
2005-12-27T09:36:00.000Z	bobbyd	psusi	I used it to recover data from a physically broken Windows NTFS drive
2005-12-27T09:36:00.000Z	bobbyd	psusi	of course, it's a licensing issue
2005-12-27T09:36:00.000Z	psusi	bobbyd	ntfsclone is good for that
2005-12-27T09:37:00.000Z	psusi	bobbyd	not really... they don't distribute the driver.. you have to grab a copy from your windows install
2005-12-27T09:38:00.000Z	bobbyd	psusi	still, most distros wouldn't touch it simply because it uses propietory MS files
2005-12-27T09:38:00.000Z	psusi	bobbyd	yup... which is why I don't either ;)
2005-12-27T09:38:00.000Z	bobbyd	psusi	ok, so it is a licensing thing :)
2005-12-27T09:39:00.000Z	psusi	bobbyd	no... when you say it is a licensing thing, you are saying that you need to obtain a license to do it... you don't
2005-12-27T09:39:00.000Z	bobbyd	psusi	no, I'm saying that the distros don't like using closed source code under a proprietory licence, so they dont :)
2005-12-27T09:41:00.000Z	psusi	bobbyd	then say it uses proprietary software, which nobody likes... not the same as a licencing issue... mp3 has licencing issues... but lame is open source
