2008-05-30T07:54:00.000Z	Flannel	anirudh0	no, the config files in question are the ones in /etc/, it will not remove anything in your homedir
2008-05-30T07:54:00.000Z	Flannel	anirudh0	With or without the purge
2008-05-30T07:56:00.000Z	Flannel	anirudh0	/ignore -channels #ubuntu * JOINS PARTS QUITS NICKS
2008-05-30T07:57:00.000Z	anirudh0	Flannel	thanks
2008-06-04T21:56:00.000Z	anirudh0	Flannel	what happens when a version reaches end of life..normal users dont use canonical support anyway
2008-06-04T21:57:00.000Z	Flannel	anirudh0	You no longer get updates (and eventually the mirrors get taken down)
2008-06-06T08:18:00.000Z	anirudh0	Flannel	i thinks he wants a server, not a client
2008-06-07T02:06:00.000Z	anirudh0	Flannel	jingle works properly yet in anything you've used?
2008-06-07T02:07:00.000Z	Flannel	anirudh0	m_newton: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingle_%28protocol%29  show the clients that do it
2008-06-07T02:08:00.000Z	anirudh0	Flannel	i meant..have you tried any yourself..psi segfaulted the last time i tried
2008-06-07T02:08:00.000Z	Flannel	anirudh0	No, I havent.
2008-06-07T02:09:00.000Z	Flannel	anirudh0	But, some of those offer 'stable' support (not just experimental)
2008-06-07T02:11:00.000Z	Flannel	anirudh0	thats not a good idea
2008-06-07T02:12:00.000Z	anirudh0	Flannel	update-grub will create a menu.lst if it does'nt find one
2008-06-07T02:13:00.000Z	Flannel	anirudh0	Right, but it wont include a windows entries.  reinstalling probably isn't necessary.
2008-06-07T02:16:00.000Z	Flannel	anirudh0	Have you filed a bugreport?
2008-06-07T02:17:00.000Z	anirudh0	Flannel	i meant that there was no problem with the repo as i have the same subversion
2008-06-07T02:17:00.000Z	Flannel	anirudh0	ah
2008-06-07T07:02:00.000Z	Flannel	anirudh0	Feature freeze isn't until August, firefox should be all sorted out by 8.04.1, although I believe it was supposed to already be at that.
2008-06-07T07:02:00.000Z	anirudh0	Flannel	i meant the devs are busy..hence the delay in uploading packages to hardy
