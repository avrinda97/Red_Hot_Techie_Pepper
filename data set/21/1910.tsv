2010-03-17T05:33:00.000Z	Silent_Dream		does anyone have a step by step walk through for me to get this specific model of wireless usb adapter working on ubuntu (its not supported out of box):Linksys  WUSB54GSC
2010-03-17T05:35:00.000Z	chili555	Silent_Dream	: they come in several versions all with different chipsets. which is yours?
2010-03-17T05:35:00.000Z	Silent_Dream	chili555	version 2.0 is the one i've been able to use succesfully on windows
2010-03-17T05:38:00.000Z	chili555	Silent_Dream	please see  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1247163&highlight=WUSB54GSC  it looks like ndiswrapper is the method. what does lsusb say it is?
2010-03-17T05:41:00.000Z	Silent_Dream	chili555	to do that, i would need to install ndiswrapper, which means i'd need working internet, which is what i'm trying to achieve by getting the wireless adapter recognized
2010-03-17T05:42:00.000Z	chili555	Silent_Dream	i think the ndiswrapper packages are on the install CD. do you have the driver cd for the devive that has the windows inf file?
2010-03-17T05:42:00.000Z	Silent_Dream	chili555	im not sure, never messed with drivers like this before..dont really know any of the terminology here
2010-03-17T05:43:00.000Z	chili555	Silent_Dream	 can you give us the Linksys part of the terminal command lsusb? maybe we can find a better way
2010-03-17T05:44:00.000Z	Silent_Dream	chili555	i can do that, i suppose I'll need to reboot and run taht command and then reboot again...
2010-03-17T05:45:00.000Z	chili555	Silent_Dream	i will be here. i am especially interested in the usb.id, something like 123e:456a
2010-03-17T05:46:00.000Z	Silent_Dream	chili555	i cannot connect to internet on ubuntu though
2010-03-17T05:46:00.000Z	chili555	Silent_Dream	can you just write it down? maybe there is a way with a usb key
2010-03-17T05:56:00.000Z	Silent_Dream	chili555	ran lsusb -v, you want me to pastebin output or is there a certain line you seek
2010-03-17T05:59:00.000Z	chili555	Silent_Dream	is there a line that relates to your Linksys? i need the usb.id, something like 123a:456b
2010-03-17T06:01:00.000Z	chili555	Silent_Dream	is it 0014:13b1??
2010-03-17T06:04:00.000Z	chili555	Silent_Dream	is there anything about Broadcom?
2010-03-17T06:06:00.000Z	chili555	Silent_Dream	everything i have read says ndiswrapper. i will be happy to assist you on the forum. it's a bit lengthy to go through here
2010-03-17T06:07:00.000Z	Silent_Dream	chili555	perhaps ill only be here for another day, maybe its not worth it
2010-03-17T06:08:00.000Z	chili555	Silent_Dream	if you need to get it going, post on the forum and give me a private message and i'll help you
2010-03-17T06:08:00.000Z	Silent_Dream	chili555	sounds good, whats your SN?
