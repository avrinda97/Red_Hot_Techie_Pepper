2010-05-29T18:07:00.000Z	alktors	robberto	I think yes, why, are you experiencing problems?
2010-05-29T18:09:00.000Z	alktors	robberto	Are you on a laptop or desktop?
2010-05-29T18:09:00.000Z	robberto	alktors	laptop
2010-05-29T18:09:00.000Z	alktors	robberto	 Maybe you touched the touchpad ....that's why.
2010-05-29T18:10:00.000Z	robberto	alktors	hehe no, i was watching at a website, reading. And suddenly my mouse moved when i wasn't doing anything..
2010-05-29T18:11:00.000Z	alktors	robberto	Are you using an external mouse aswell?
2010-05-29T18:11:00.000Z	alktors	robberto	 By the way I'm really a beginner user so don't know how well I will assist you in your problem.
2010-05-29T18:11:00.000Z	robberto	alktors	i have one, but didn't have it with me last night, so i was only using my touchpad
2010-05-29T18:12:00.000Z	alktors	robberto	I don't know, try and disable your touchpad and use an external mouse.
2010-05-29T18:12:00.000Z	robberto	alktors	thanks for the help then so far, any help is always appriciated
2010-05-29T18:12:00.000Z	alktors	robberto	 See if this happens again.
2010-05-29T18:12:00.000Z	alktors	robberto	 command：synclient touchpadoff=1 －－disable touchpad
2010-05-29T18:12:00.000Z	alktors	robberto	 command：synclient touchpadoff=0 －－enable touchpad
2010-05-29T18:13:00.000Z	alktors	robberto	 There are no viruses or such things involved in your problem I think.
2010-05-29T18:15:00.000Z	robberto	alktors	i'd like to keep my touchpad on, as my son oftens takes my mouse often with him ^^
2010-05-29T18:17:00.000Z	alktors	robberto	 I see...well my simple guess is that there is nothing wrong with your system, no big brother is watching you, I had your problem aswell and it was because of my touchpad.
