2009-11-01T00:30:00.000Z	trism	tanath	yeah, they seem to have disabled it on launchpad, they want you to use ubuntu-bug now
2009-11-01T00:30:00.000Z	tanath	trism	penguin42 that's retarded. what if you can't?? >.<
2009-11-01T00:31:00.000Z	trism	tanath	not disagreeing with you, just the way it is
2009-11-01T00:31:00.000Z	tanath	trism	who's bright idea was that? >.<
2009-11-01T00:32:00.000Z	trism	tanath	no idea
2011-11-10T02:11:00.000Z	trism	tanath	the gnome-panel applications menu? if so, yes, they removed the context menus from the items
2011-11-10T02:11:00.000Z	tanath	trism	wtf? who's idiotic idea was that?
2011-11-10T02:12:00.000Z	tanath	trism	i'd like to add some shortcuts to the panel >_<
2011-11-10T02:13:00.000Z	trism	tanath	you can still alt+right click the panel, add to panel, then select the application shortcuts you want to add
2011-11-10T02:13:00.000Z	tanath	trism	no you can't
2011-11-10T02:13:00.000Z	tanath	trism	already tried that
2011-11-10T02:13:00.000Z	tanath	trism	that only works for applets/extensions
2011-11-10T02:14:00.000Z	trism	tanath	it does work, I have several launchers in my panel
2011-11-10T02:14:00.000Z	tanath	trism	actually, i can't even do that now
2011-11-10T02:14:00.000Z	trism	tanath	you need to hold ALT before right clicking
2011-11-10T02:14:00.000Z	tanath	trism	alt+right-click does nothing
2011-11-10T02:14:00.000Z	tanath	trism	i'm not a noob ;)
2011-11-10T02:15:00.000Z	tanath	trism	actually, i find alt+right-click rarely works
2011-11-10T02:15:00.000Z	tanath	trism	and it's a stupid idea anyway
2011-11-10T02:16:00.000Z	tanath	trism	making it so you have to hold alt first, that is
2011-11-10T02:16:00.000Z	trism	tanath	yes, I do agree, they got a bit alt-happy in gnome 3
