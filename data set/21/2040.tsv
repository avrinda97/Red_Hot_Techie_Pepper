2010-09-21T06:23:00.000Z	leo		what are buffer and cache ?
2010-09-21T06:24:00.000Z	leo		from the output of the command free,the 1st and 2nd line ?
2010-09-21T06:24:00.000Z	xMff	leo	buffers are areas of ram where linux puts data in when writing or reading from files
2010-09-21T06:25:00.000Z	xMff	leo	cache is used by linux to hold file contents in ram for faster access, it is freed as soon as programs needs this ram
2010-09-21T06:25:00.000Z	leo	xMff	can you give some example to prove it
2010-09-21T06:25:00.000Z	xMff	leo	the linux kernel sources ;)
2010-09-21T06:26:00.000Z	leo	xMff	oh my god that's impossible for now
2010-09-21T06:27:00.000Z	leo	xMff	maybe ,that's the only right way to understand cache and buffer clearly
2010-09-21T06:28:00.000Z	xMff	leo	can't think of an easy way to test it. You'll notice it when running "ls" or "find" on a directly with like 10.000 files, the first time takes some time, subsequent accesses are way faster
2010-09-21T06:28:00.000Z	leo	xMff	yeah i got it
2010-09-21T06:29:00.000Z	leo	xMff	that's the buffer
2010-09-21T06:29:00.000Z	leo	xMff	cache
2010-09-21T06:29:00.000Z	xMff	leo	the cache. buffers are used to aggregate data preio to writing to the target or after reading from it
2010-09-21T06:30:00.000Z	leo	xMff	but how can i different them ? which still puzzled me
2010-09-21T06:31:00.000Z	xMff	leo	from userspace? thats hard. it's the kernels business to handle that, you usually do not need to worry about it
2010-09-21T06:32:00.000Z	leo	xMff	maybe you can give me some advice to help understand them , web info or some book
2010-09-21T06:32:00.000Z	leo	xMff	i'll check it by myself
2010-09-21T06:33:00.000Z	leo	xMff	about this point ,i find myself a beginner
2010-09-21T06:36:00.000Z	leo	xMff	. it is so hard task for me to explore the kernel source code, i tried but failed ,just wait to try agian later
2010-09-21T06:37:00.000Z	xMff	leo	google for linux memory management, linux buffer cache etc., there's plenty of material
2010-09-21T06:39:00.000Z	leo	xMff	thks  i'll
