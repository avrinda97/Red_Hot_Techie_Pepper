2011-09-25T22:42:00.000Z	uriel1998	unk	Do you use conky?
2011-09-25T22:44:00.000Z	uriel1998	unk	Conky is a low-resource way to do so, but requires a little work on your part
2011-09-25T22:44:00.000Z	unk	uriel1998	i dont know anything about Conky
2011-09-25T22:45:00.000Z	uriel1998	unk	Brief summary here -> http://lifehacker.com/5067158/conky-puts-lightweight-ambient-system-stats-on-linux-desktops
2011-09-25T22:46:00.000Z	uriel1998	unk	And then customizations can look like this -> http://lifehacker.com/5068294/beautifully-minimalist-conky-setup
2011-09-25T22:47:00.000Z	uriel1998	unk	Or anything, really.  Mine's a thin black bar across the top with desktop, CPU, RAM, CPU temp, uptime, load, network, wifi strength, up/down speeds, and LAN/WLAN IP addresses.
2011-09-25T22:48:00.000Z	unk	uriel1998	thnxx
2011-09-25T22:50:00.000Z	uriel1998	unk	No prob.  Mine's complex, but if you want to see it (and then tweak), it's here: http://pastebin.com/qUfFDy4x
2011-09-25T22:51:00.000Z	uriel1998	unk	Deviantart also has lots of examples:  http://browse.deviantart.com/customization/skins/linuxutil/applications/conky/
2011-09-25T22:52:00.000Z	unk	uriel1998	how should i use that?? i m newbie
2011-09-25T22:54:00.000Z	uriel1998	unk	That's the configuration (or .rc) file.  When you install conky, there's automagically a file called .conkyrc in your home directory.  That would be a replacement for it.

2011-09-25T22:55:00.000Z	uriel1998	unk	Usually folks find one they mostly like and then change bits to make it work the way they want.
2011-09-25T22:56:00.000Z	uriel1998	unk	You can also get some system stats through appindicators on the gnome-panel.  That's probably the EASIEST way to do it.  Been a while since I used that, but I had most of that info on the panel before I switched desktop managers.
2011-09-25T23:07:00.000Z	unk	uriel1998	where i can find tutorials for i better understanding IRC ?
2011-09-25T23:08:00.000Z	uriel1998	unk	This seems to be a good one - I'm still getting used to it again myself.  It was 1992 last time I used IRC before this year...  http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/ircprimer.html
2011-09-25T23:13:00.000Z	unk	uriel1998	Is there any Command line (colourful) IRC app ??
2011-09-25T23:14:00.000Z	uriel1998	unk	No idea - I'm using Xchat.
2011-09-25T23:14:00.000Z	unk	uriel1998	ok
2011-09-25T23:14:00.000Z	uriel1998	unk	I believe you can use pidgin as well - which would imply you could use the Finch ncurses version of Pidgin, but I could never get the hang of Finch.
