2011-01-06T15:21:00.000Z	imagine87		Need some help please: My system will not boot at all after I did something wrong
2011-01-06T15:22:00.000Z	imagine87		Could someone help with this?
2011-01-06T15:22:00.000Z	iRabbit	imagine87	Did you -rf /root? :)
2011-01-06T15:22:00.000Z	imagine87		no
2011-01-06T15:22:00.000Z	imagine87		But I did change permissions on /var
2011-01-06T15:22:00.000Z	imagine87		to root:username
2011-01-06T15:23:00.000Z	imagine87		recursively
2011-01-06T15:23:00.000Z	iRabbit	imagine87	and its not booting?
2011-01-06T15:23:00.000Z	imagine87		Among other things I think
2011-01-06T15:23:00.000Z	imagine87		Yes, I am not sure exactly what I did
2011-01-06T15:23:00.000Z	imagine87		Is there a way I can diagnose this?
2011-01-06T15:23:00.000Z	iRabbit	imagine87	are you able to rescue boot the system?
2011-01-06T15:24:00.000Z	imagine87	iRabbit	I am on another Linux install on the computer
2011-01-06T15:24:00.000Z	imagine87		Is there a way I can boot from it or diagnose the problem?
2011-01-06T15:24:00.000Z	iRabbit	imagine87	http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-boot-ubuntu-linux-rescue-mode/
2011-01-06T15:26:00.000Z	iRabbit	imagine87	same machine?
2011-01-06T15:26:00.000Z	imagine87		Yes I am on the same machine
2011-01-06T15:26:00.000Z	imagine87		But a different partition
2011-01-06T15:26:00.000Z	imagine87		right now
2011-01-06T15:27:00.000Z	iRabbit	imagine87	you're probably going to have to reinstall :(
2011-01-06T15:27:00.000Z	iRabbit	imagine87	and don't break it next time ;)
