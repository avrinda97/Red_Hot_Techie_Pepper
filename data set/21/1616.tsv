2012-06-08T08:38:00.000Z	rkhshm	jarray52	any ideas?

2012-06-08T08:40:00.000Z	jarray52	rkhshm	Is it possible your boot problems are due to heat?
2012-06-08T08:41:00.000Z	jarray52	rkhshm	That would be my guess.
2012-06-08T08:41:00.000Z	rkhshm	jarray52	i dont think so. Because i've used this machine for nearly 2 yrs now and till date its had many sleepless nights and never have i seen this problem...
2012-06-08T08:45:00.000Z	jarray52	rkhshm	If it isn't getting to BIOS, it is either a BIOS bug, malware that infects BIOS, or hardware failure. Malware that sophisticated is unlikely. Check your manufacturer's website regarding BIOS bugs. Hardware is tricky. It could be anything from a capacitor to a chip.
2012-06-08T08:46:00.000Z	rkhshm	jarray52	the reason i'm so involved in fixing this is becuase i get warranty on the mobo as of now..
