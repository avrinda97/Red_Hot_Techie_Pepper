2009-03-23T16:51:00.000Z	hmw		how can i turn off the notification when a contact goes online in pidgin?
2009-03-23T16:52:00.000Z	Imahilus	hmw	in the preferences
2009-03-23T16:53:00.000Z	Imahilus	hmw	you want to disable the smiley in the pidgin icon aswell when a contact messages you?
2009-03-23T16:54:00.000Z	hmw	Imahilus	no, i am talking about the extra popup (system tray notification)
2009-03-23T16:54:00.000Z	hmw	Imahilus	might be jaunty?
2009-03-23T16:56:00.000Z	Imahilus	hmw	sorry, beats me
2009-03-23T16:56:00.000Z	Imahilus	hmw	new myself, figured you meant the sound
2009-03-23T16:58:00.000Z	Imahilus	hmw	actually, I don't even get notification popups?
2009-03-23T16:58:00.000Z	Imahilus	hmw	I run basic pidgin that comes with ubuntu
2009-03-23T16:58:00.000Z	hmw	Imahilus	you should, eg. if you connect to a network
2009-03-23T16:59:00.000Z	hmw	Imahilus	ah, thought you were talking about notifications in general
2009-03-23T16:59:00.000Z	Imahilus	hmw	those popups last a second or so, and aren't top-level, so I rarely see em
2009-03-23T17:01:00.000Z	hmw	Imahilus	thx
2009-03-23T17:01:00.000Z	Imahilus	hmw	I helped? =D
2009-03-23T17:01:00.000Z	hmw	Imahilus	no, but you tried. *g*
2009-03-23T17:01:00.000Z	Imahilus	hmw	sorry it was of no help then ;)
2009-03-23T17:02:00.000Z	hmw	Imahilus	ubuntu+1 told me the solution: in the plugins, you can turn off libnotify popups
2009-03-23T17:03:00.000Z	Imahilus	hmw	I'll keep it in mind =)
2009-03-23T18:32:00.000Z	hmw	Imahilus	wicd
2009-03-23T18:33:00.000Z	Imahilus	hmw	can't find 'wicd' with the package manager?
2009-03-23T18:34:00.000Z	hmw	Imahilus	might be... google it... wicd worked great for me and i have seen others talking similar about it
