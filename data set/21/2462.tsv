2009-10-03T21:58:00.000Z	home__		every few seconds there is an anoyying noise in the system - what can it be?
2009-10-03T21:58:00.000Z	mesa_booger	home__	could be fans starting up. or optical drive polling
2009-10-03T21:59:00.000Z	home__	mesa_booger	rsk - ok, i will do that
2009-10-03T22:00:00.000Z	home__	mesa_booger	rsk - it isnt the optical drive but i can open check the fans, it doesnt sound related to fans but i will check
2009-10-03T22:02:00.000Z	home__	mesa_booger	rsk - it doesnt related to fans as they always on
2009-10-03T22:03:00.000Z	mesa_booger	home__	any other moving parts in there apart from fans and drives ?
2009-10-03T22:03:00.000Z	home__	mesa_booger	no - i can also chech what other sound settings will make it like
2009-10-03T22:05:00.000Z	home__	mesa_booger	so recording the sound is the only good idea?
2009-10-03T22:05:00.000Z	mesa_booger	home__	open up the case and use a stethoscope :)
2009-10-03T22:06:00.000Z	home__	mesa_booger	there are many devices to choose from at 'sound'
2009-10-03T22:06:00.000Z	mesa_booger	home__	is the sound coming out of the speakers or out of the system case ?
2009-10-03T22:06:00.000Z	home__	mesa_booger	it is the speakers
2009-10-03T22:08:00.000Z	mesa_booger	home__	try disabling the daemons one at a time, to see which one is causing the "sounds"
2009-10-03T22:09:00.000Z	home__	mesa_booger	what are daemons?
2009-10-03T22:09:00.000Z	home__	mesa_booger	im not sure there is sound in the system by the way
2009-10-03T22:10:00.000Z	mesa_booger	home__	system services. like exim, sysklogd, gpm, gdm etc
2009-10-03T22:10:00.000Z	mesa_booger	home__	extraneous sounds from the speakers can be caused by irq problems and also by rf interference from nearby units
2009-10-03T22:10:00.000Z	home__	mesa_booger	do i need to disable them?
2009-10-03T22:11:00.000Z	mesa_booger	home__	disable each in turn. and put it back on again. when the badness stops, you have the culprit
2009-10-03T22:11:00.000Z	mesa_booger	home__	dunno then. must be the Ghost In The Machine
2009-10-03T22:12:00.000Z	home__	mesa_booger	i will try disabling but how to disable?
