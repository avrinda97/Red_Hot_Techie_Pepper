2011-06-27T05:33:00.000Z	ntr0py		Is a GF215 chip fast enough to run Compiz / Natty on it?
2011-06-27T05:34:00.000Z	Guest21598	ntr0py	I would assume no problems with that card
2011-06-27T05:53:00.000Z	Guest21598	ntr0py	i don't recall if you said you installed latest binary driver from nvidia or not?
2011-06-27T05:53:00.000Z	ntr0py	Guest21598	the one shipped with natty
2011-06-27T05:55:00.000Z	Guest21598	ntr0py	when you go to System > Administration > Hardware Drivers, what does it show for extra drivers for hardware
2011-06-27T05:57:00.000Z	ntr0py	Guest21598	It lies about proprietary driver of nvidia is aktivated mut not in use (its activated and in use actually)...
2011-06-27T05:59:00.000Z	Guest21598	ntr0py	and when you go to System > Preferences > Appearance what does it have for Visual Effects?
2011-06-27T05:59:00.000Z	ntr0py	Guest21598	none, compiz is running
2011-06-27T06:00:00.000Z	Guest21598	ntr0py	what happens if you try either of the other two options on Visual Effects?
2011-06-27T06:01:00.000Z	ntr0py	Guest21598	i dont know what you are talking about in apperence there are no visual effects anymore...
2011-06-27T06:01:00.000Z	Guest21598	ntr0py	ahh.. I am on 10.04 ... sorry
2011-06-27T06:02:00.000Z	ntr0py	Guest21598	but i missed them there too...
2011-06-27T06:03:00.000Z	ntr0py	Guest21598	i think there is something wrong with the compiz mods of natty
2011-06-27T06:03:00.000Z	ntr0py	Guest21598	unity and stuff, maybe thats the reason its so sluggish
2011-06-27T06:08:00.000Z	ntr0py	Guest21598	what card would you go for a full hd setup?
2011-06-27T06:09:00.000Z	Guest21598	ntr0py	practically speaking any new card (that is compatible with the linux drivers & ubuntu) is capable of 1080p ...
2011-06-27T06:10:00.000Z	ntr0py	Guest21598	im just thinking about abandoning nvidia  alltogether and go for an ati card (in natty compiz lags and there is no hardware acceleration for video decoding)
2011-06-27T06:10:00.000Z	Guest21598	ntr0py	there are problems with both, its no guarantee by switching to avoid problems.. kind of a case by case :/
2011-06-27T06:11:00.000Z	ntr0py	Guest21598	any idea how i could find out where the problem is?
2011-06-27T06:12:00.000Z	ntr0py	Guest21598	vainfo just tells me "Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":0.0"."
