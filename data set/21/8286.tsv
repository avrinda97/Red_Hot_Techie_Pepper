2006-05-05T13:34:00.000Z	devscott-laptop	mythica	sudo vi /etc/modules
2006-05-05T13:35:00.000Z	mythica	devscott-laptop	Hmm, that seems different though, that just has a few modules in it
2006-05-05T13:35:00.000Z	mythica	devscott-laptop	i am following an install guide, and they want me to add a whole lot of stuff
2006-05-05T13:36:00.000Z	devscott-laptop	mythica	what are you looking for?
2006-05-05T13:36:00.000Z	mythica	devscott-laptop	ill throw it in pastebin
2006-05-05T13:36:00.000Z	devscott-laptop	mythica	what are you trying to do?
2006-05-05T13:37:00.000Z	mythica	devscott-laptop	should i paste the whole install guide?
2006-05-05T13:37:00.000Z	devscott-laptop	mythica	are they compiled against the kernel?
2006-05-05T13:40:00.000Z	mythica	devscott-laptop	any ideas? I just need to know where the modules configuration file resides in ubuntu
2006-05-05T13:41:00.000Z	devscott-laptop	mythica	I believe modules.conf if dead, long live /etc/modules.
