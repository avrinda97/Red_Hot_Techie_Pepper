2007-02-24T09:55:00.000Z	Kannaida		so... I'm looking to "break into" the linux world (this is my first time on IRC even).  Kinda tired of being locked into M$ developer role... is Ubuntu a good place to start?
2007-02-24T09:55:00.000Z	Madpilot	Kannaida	we're biased, of course it is
2007-02-24T09:56:00.000Z	Madpilot	Kannaida	Ubuntu is designed to be very friendly for new users, but usable for anyone, even experts
2007-02-24T10:03:00.000Z	Madpilot	Kannaida	set up a dual boot, XP & Ubuntu, and go for it.
2007-02-24T10:05:00.000Z	Madpilot	Kannaida	not really, a lot of the underlying stuff is similar/identical across distros.
2007-02-24T10:06:00.000Z	Madpilot	Kannaida	the differences for UI stuff will be Gnome vs KDE vs XFCE etc
2007-02-24T10:06:00.000Z	Kannaida	Madpilot	thanx... I have so much aprehension... not that I don't think I *can* do it, but more that.. well... it gets intimidating
2007-02-24T10:06:00.000Z	Madpilot	Kannaida	ya, been there, done that, got over it. Best of luck, have fun. :)
2007-02-24T10:07:00.000Z	Kannaida	Madpilot	haha, thanx
2007-02-24T10:10:00.000Z	Madpilot	Kannaida	six years in Windows IT, though, right? Not the same animal, except for the basic hardware.
2007-02-24T10:11:00.000Z	Kannaida	Madpilot	I know, but 6 years with Windows and I'm thinking "I can do that" and then I think to try something new... it's tough getting used to being at the bottom again (not that I was on the top, but I wasn't on the bottom either)
2007-02-24T10:12:00.000Z	Madpilot	Kannaida	Windows "power users" often have a harder time getting used to Ubuntu/Linux/etc than ppl who just want "browsing & email" to work...
2007-02-24T10:14:00.000Z	Kannaida	Madpilot	I don't know how "Power" of a windows user I am... but I *like* to think I'm fairly good at picking up new concepts... I guess I'm going to find out pretty soon...
2007-02-24T10:24:00.000Z	Madpilot	Kannaida	burn a LiveCD before you nuke your current box, make sure it works, you'll always have a working OS that way
2007-02-24T10:24:00.000Z	Kannaida	Madpilot	sounds good to me
2007-02-24T10:25:00.000Z	Madpilot	Kannaida	or just set up a dualboot with whatever is on the box currently
2007-02-24T10:25:00.000Z	Kannaida	Madpilot	LiveCD is maybe best option for now... it's like a trial, right?
2007-02-24T10:25:00.000Z	Madpilot	Kannaida	yes, but there's an option to install right from the LiveCD, which is very cool.
2007-02-24T10:27:00.000Z	Kannaida	Madpilot	cool, that may be the best way to go for now.
2007-02-24T10:27:00.000Z	Kannaida	Madpilot	this way I have a chance to learn something before I have to tell my wife what to do ;)
2007-02-24T10:27:00.000Z	Madpilot	Kannaida	sounds like a plan
