2008-11-16T09:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb		I made a 1GB  swap partition and I also have a 4mb or so swap partition,  because of the way my partition set up is done,  I thought may as well use that 4mb for something.    I also think this computer is not using any swap,  how to turn it on?
2008-11-16T09:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb		swapon did nothing
2008-11-16T09:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb		and
2008-11-16T09:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb		well no errrors for swapon
2008-11-16T09:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb		and nothing else in terminal
2008-11-16T09:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb		dmesg | grep swap   just came up with like a  manual type thing
2008-11-16T09:45:00.000Z	joot	sebsebseb	I think your swap is toooo small and should be around 512 mb
2008-11-16T09:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	joot	I have two now,  a 1GB swap and the small 4mb or so
2008-11-16T09:46:00.000Z	joot	sebsebseb	not sure what the 4mb would do
