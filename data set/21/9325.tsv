2005-10-07T09:06:00.000Z	Stricklin		Anybody?
2005-10-07T06:58:00.000Z	Stricklin		Can you change the permissions of a folder and have it change the permissions of the underlying files as well, or do you have to go through and change those individually?
2005-10-07T06:59:00.000Z	Stricklin		Okay, walk me through it?
2005-10-07T07:00:00.000Z	Stricklin		I'm extremely new to Linux
2005-10-07T07:01:00.000Z	holycow	Stricklin	thats in #debian
2005-10-07T07:04:00.000Z	holycow	Stricklin	there is a command called 'mount'
2005-10-07T07:49:00.000Z	holycow	Stricklin	don't do that
2005-10-07T07:49:00.000Z	holycow	Stricklin	copy it to your home dir /home/user/mozilla/whatever
2005-10-07T07:49:00.000Z	Stricklin	holycow	why not?
2005-10-07T07:49:00.000Z	holycow	Stricklin	because its stupid, your preferences are in your user dir
2005-10-07T07:50:00.000Z	holycow	Stricklin	/etc is for system wide preferences, user specific stuff is in /home, keep your personal settings there
2005-10-07T07:57:00.000Z	holycow	Stricklin	you aren't 'moving' anywhere
2005-10-07T07:58:00.000Z	holycow	Stricklin	what you actually want to do is mix both forms of nauitlus for specific file management tasks
2005-10-07T07:59:00.000Z	Stricklin	holycow	so, if I go to /home/foo/ and maximize it, the next time I view that directory it'll be maximized already?
2005-10-07T07:59:00.000Z	holycow	Stricklin	correct
2005-10-07T08:00:00.000Z	holycow	Stricklin	remember its just a tool, learn the tool and learn how it behaves, then figure out how to use it best
2005-10-07T08:01:00.000Z	holycow	Stricklin	most people get stuck on the immediate emotional impression of something like 'spatial nautilus'
2005-10-07T08:01:00.000Z	holycow	Stricklin	breezy will have an updated nautilus with an interesting twist to spatial
2005-10-07T08:44:00.000Z	Stricklin	holycow	ASF files?
2005-10-07T08:45:00.000Z	holycow	Stricklin	what about asf files?
2005-10-07T08:45:00.000Z	holycow	Stricklin	the most important thing to remember is that it isn't windows, learn the tool and how it works on its own terms.  you will absorb most of the knowledge through osmosis :)
