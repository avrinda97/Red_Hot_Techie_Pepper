2012-03-13T21:43:00.000Z	zul0	johnjacobjinger	i dont understand your question. sorry for my bad english xd
2012-03-13T21:44:00.000Z	johnjacobjinger	zul0	so u r testing with speedtest.net... ok  how different are the results zul0
2012-03-13T21:45:00.000Z	johnjacobjinger	zul0	maybe ur NIC is not functioning in full duplex
2012-03-13T21:46:00.000Z	johnjacobjinger	zul0	are you in ubuntu right now?
2012-03-13T21:46:00.000Z	zul0	johnjacobjinger	let me check my card model. i think it has 100mbps support
2012-03-13T21:47:00.000Z	johnjacobjinger	zul0	Are you using Ubuntu right now?
2012-03-13T21:47:00.000Z	johnjacobjinger	zul0	go to the terminal and type this:   dmesg | grep -i duplex
2012-03-13T21:53:00.000Z	johnjacobjinger	zul0	hard to say what could cause the internet speed to test slower between OSes... maybe for some reason the speeds arent slower but speedtest is thinking it is
2012-03-13T21:53:00.000Z	zul0	johnjacobjinger	maybe the cause is my driver?
2012-03-13T21:53:00.000Z	johnjacobjinger	zul0	doubt it
2012-03-13T21:55:00.000Z	zul0	johnjacobjinger	thanks for your help. maybe is my router...or something..xd
2012-03-13T21:55:00.000Z	johnjacobjinger	zul0	doubt it.. the router doesnt care about OS... what kind of network card is it suppose to be in the computer?

2012-03-13T22:01:00.000Z	zul0	johnjacobjinger	my driver is atl1c
2012-03-13T22:02:00.000Z	johnjacobjinger	zul0	never heard of it... is this a realtek nic?
