2012-06-03T14:48:00.000Z	oCean	damms005	https://help.ubuntu.com/ has all this information
2012-06-03T14:53:00.000Z	oCean	damms005	you can find/list the ip address of pc1 by running ifconfig -a on pc1. You can access pc1 from pc2 by hostname (if you want) by editing /etc/hosts
2012-06-03T14:54:00.000Z	oCean	damms005	you can find/list the ip address of pc1 by running ifconfig -a on pc1. You can access pc1 from pc2 by hostname (if you want) by editing /etc/hosts
2012-06-03T14:55:00.000Z	damms005	oCean	is there a lead to something I can read to be able to do that? (you can find/list the ip address of pc1 by running ifconfig -a on pc1. You can access pc1 from pc2 by hostname (if you want) by editing /etc/hosts) Thanks
2012-06-03T14:56:00.000Z	oCean	damms005	on pc1 open a terminal and type ifconfig -a
2012-06-03T14:58:00.000Z	damms005	oCean	I saw a bunch of information when I did that. (most of em I dont understand though) but info on eth1, lo, ppp0....all contain inet addr
2012-06-03T15:00:00.000Z	oCean	damms005	somewhere in the output is the actual ip address of pc1, I can not tell which since I do not know your setup/configuration.
2012-06-03T15:00:00.000Z	oCean	damms005	first you need to determine pc1's ip address, then edit /etc/hosts on pc2
2012-06-03T15:00:00.000Z	oCean	damms005	but again, all this is at http://help.ubuntu.com
2012-06-03T15:00:00.000Z	oCean	damms005	you might want to start reading first
2012-06-03T15:06:00.000Z	damms005	oCean	okay i'll do that in earnest. but can you just finish that up? 127.0.0.1 is the localhost as seen from /etc/hosts
2012-06-03T15:06:00.000Z	oCean	damms005	yes, but every computer has a 127.0.0.1, so you cannot use that from another pc (2) to communicate with other pc (1)
2012-06-03T15:07:00.000Z	oCean	damms005	if you do not have a basic understanding of how to work with Linux, it is really difficult to configure a webserver
2012-06-03T15:07:00.000Z	oCean	damms005	that is why I suggest you should start reading/learning on basics
2012-06-03T15:08:00.000Z	damms005	oCean	Sorry I am not that bad...lol(I am presently running lampp which I use to test my PHP pages locally before deployment ). so does it mean I will have to manually assign IP to  pc1?
2012-06-03T15:09:00.000Z	damms005	oCean	I am already reading the guide you suggested. Thanks
2012-06-03T15:16:00.000Z	oCean	damms005	now you are just being silly
2012-06-03T15:16:00.000Z	oCean	damms005	https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/index.html do you not see "networking"?
2012-06-03T15:17:00.000Z	oCean	damms005	you just keep asking people for help, you will get referred to the documentation over and over again, since you are missing basic understanding
2012-06-03T15:18:00.000Z	damms005	oCean	Thanks ocean, NETWORKING is written there IN BLACK&WHITE...lol.  You guys re so kind. thanks
2012-06-03T15:35:00.000Z	damms005	oCean	what is ethernetR I am reading the guide but they didn't clarify ETHERNET
