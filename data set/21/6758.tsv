2007-03-11T16:54:00.000Z	gravemind		hey I messed up my home folder somehow when I was making a new partition to mount there, and now I can't make new users, can you help me figure out what's going on?
2007-03-11T16:54:00.000Z	gravemind		the thing is I accidentally interrupted the mv, so some folders got deleted, so I needed to recreate some other accounts
2007-03-11T16:55:00.000Z	xtknight	gravemind	well you may not be able to make new users since /home doesn't exist or you dont have permissions to it
2007-03-11T16:56:00.000Z	gravemind	xtknight	It exists, and I checked the permissions with the file browser, and they point to root
2007-03-11T16:56:00.000Z	xtknight	gravemind	pastebin the results of "ls -al" under /
2007-03-11T16:56:00.000Z	xtknight	gravemind	and also the ones of "ls -al" under /home
2007-03-11T16:58:00.000Z	gravemind	xtknight	I don't see any in / or /home
2007-03-11T16:58:00.000Z	xtknight	gravemind	you don't see any of what?
2007-03-11T16:59:00.000Z	gravemind	xtknight	the results of ls -al seem to be the contents of my homefolder, "~/"
2007-03-11T16:59:00.000Z	xtknight	gravemind	um errrrr... ok post the results of "ls -al" in /, and then post the results of "ls -al" under /home  and i'll see what's up
2007-03-11T06:00:00.000Z	gravemind	xtknight	oh sorry, I get it now. First cd to the directory, then run "ls -al"?
2007-03-11T06:00:00.000Z	xtknight	gravemind	correct
2007-03-11T06:02:00.000Z	gravemind	xtknight	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/9732/
2007-03-11T06:04:00.000Z	xtknight	gravemind	so what happens when you try to create a new user?  and how are you craeting a new user?
2007-03-11T06:05:00.000Z	gravemind	xtknight	I use the system>admin>users and groups application, and it acts like it made a new user, but the new user can't log in, and they don't get a folder in /home
2007-03-11T06:11:00.000Z	gravemind	xtknight	did you check the pastebin
2007-03-11T06:11:00.000Z	xtknight	gravemind	oops sorry sorta forgot
2007-03-11T06:12:00.000Z	xtknight	gravemind	yeah it looked fine to me..have you tried "adduser"?
2007-03-11T06:13:00.000Z	gravemind	xtknight	- no, haven't
2007-03-11T06:13:00.000Z	xtknight	gravemind	"sudo adduser --shell /bin/bash --home /home/myuser myuser"
2007-03-11T06:22:00.000Z	xtknight	gravemind	any luck?
