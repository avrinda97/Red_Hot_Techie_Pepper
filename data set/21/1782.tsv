2010-07-14T16:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pyghassen	 you can easially set it to a blank password. so it never asks
2010-07-14T16:36:00.000Z	pyghassen	Dr_Willis	 how can i do that, if i know i wouldn't ask
2010-07-14T16:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pyghassen	 applcations -> acessories -> passwords -> right click on the one entry that says LOGIN: i recall. and use teh change password menu item
2010-07-14T16:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pyghassen	 you are using gnome?  Applications -> accessories menu  is right there for me.
