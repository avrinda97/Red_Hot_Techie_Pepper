2007-09-30T07:15:00.000Z	nonewmsgs		how is sudo apt-get upgrade different from the update manager
2007-09-30T07:16:00.000Z	nonewmsgs		cool thanks sunsparcsolaris
2007-09-30T07:16:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	nonewmsgs	i believe apt-get upgrade, is a distribution upgrade command, .... where as update manager updates packages
2007-09-30T07:17:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	nonewmsgs	so there is no difference, other than one is cli, one is a gui
2008-03-30T20:38:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	nonewmsgs	?... DSL?  128m,b will definitely run numerous "larger" distros.
2008-03-30T20:40:00.000Z	nonewmsgs	IndyGunFreak	i'll take your word for it.  i personally prefer my systems to be responsive and seem fast
2008-03-30T20:40:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	nonewmsgs	lol, gocart painted like a race-car, is still a gokart

2008-06-15T08:27:00.000Z	nonewmsgs	IndyGunFreak	 i get a java error so i just use gtk-gnutella
2008-06-15T08:27:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	nonewmsgs	uh.. install java?
2008-06-15T08:27:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	nonewmsgs	weird, cuz the only time ive saw that message, is when I don't install java.. are you sure its installed?.. or do you just have JRE installed?
2008-06-15T08:30:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	nonewmsgs	i think your problem is summed up on line 27
2008-06-15T08:30:00.000Z	nonewmsgs	IndyGunFreak	so i should tget the other jre too?
2008-06-15T08:30:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	nonewmsgs	hold on a sec.
2008-06-15T08:31:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	nonewmsgs	open synaptic.. and do a search for sun
2008-06-15T08:32:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	nonewmsgs	and here's the packages i have... sun-java6-bin, sun-java6-demo, sun-java6-jdk, sun-java6-jre, sun-java6-plugin, sun-java6-source
2008-06-15T08:35:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	nonewmsgs	hmm, thats strange.. you must not have the source repository enabled
2008-06-15T08:35:00.000Z	nonewmsgs	IndyGunFreak	i just didnt select it when i installed java via synaptic :P
2008-06-15T08:36:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	nonewmsgs	oh ok.
2008-06-15T09:24:00.000Z	nonewmsgs	IndyGunFreak	 it still doesnt work
