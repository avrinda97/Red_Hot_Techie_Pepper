2006-06-06T13:33:00.000Z	scr		i was wondering if someone could lend me a hand with installing windows after ubuntu
2006-06-06T13:33:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	scr	http://auk.ca/dd
2006-06-06T13:34:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	scr	that has information on reloading the bootloader after Windows wipes it out (which it will do)
2006-06-06T13:34:00.000Z	scr	Samus_Aran	i am past that
2006-06-06T13:39:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	scr	that wouldn't have anything to do with GRUB or GNU/Linux
2006-06-06T13:39:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	scr	it completely overwrites it
2006-06-06T13:40:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	scr	if it isn't booting stage two of the install, the problem lies elsewhere.  I recommend confirming the partition is marked as "bootable"
2006-06-06T13:41:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	scr	and keep in mind that Windows in general likes to live on the first disk marked as bootable in the partition table (normally the primary master)
2006-06-06T13:41:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	scr	which partition is Windows on ?
2006-06-06T13:41:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	scr	and what are in the partitions before it ?
2006-06-06T13:42:00.000Z	scr	Samus_Aran	#4, /boot and / are before it
2006-06-06T13:42:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	scr	if there are any partitions before Windows that Windows can see (e.g. NTFS, FAT32, etc.) it won't boot
2006-06-06T13:42:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	scr	you can use GRUB to remap the partitions so XP's becomes the first partition
2006-06-06T13:43:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	scr	is the windows partition marked as "bootable" ?
2006-06-06T13:44:00.000Z	scr	Samus_Aran	i tried to mark and unmark it, didnt help my case then
2006-06-06T13:44:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	scr	well you can try the partition remapping with GRUB to see if it will boot it and continue the install
2006-06-06T13:45:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	scr	this is more a question for a Windows support channel, as this is an example of how difficult Windows is to install in any non-standard locations
2006-06-06T13:46:00.000Z	scr	Samus_Aran	do you really think that windows dudes know anything about this type of problem? :)
2006-06-06T13:48:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	scr	just tell them "I am trying to install Windows XP to the fourth partition of the primary master, with the first three partitions belonging to another O/S"
2006-06-06T13:48:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	scr	it would have been far better to install XP to hda1
2006-06-06T13:48:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	scr	anyhow, good luck
