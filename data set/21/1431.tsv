2010-09-19T11:02:00.000Z	TurtleSoup		I need some help (who doesn't...), I opened up 81 workspaces just for the hell of it, and my system was not very happy at all. It reverted back to 36, and now that number is static, I can't change it (also, the "preferences" window for workspaces flickers). Now none of my windows have the bars around them with the X, minimize, maximize, etc. Any ideas?
2010-09-19T11:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TurtleSoup	 title bar vanished = compiz or metacity crashed.. alt-f2 and do 'compiz --replace'
2010-09-19T11:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TurtleSoup	 which may explain the other issues also
2010-09-19T11:03:00.000Z	TurtleSoup	Dr_Willis	thank you sir. I'll give it a try.
2010-09-19T11:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TurtleSoup	 or try 'metacity --replace'
2010-09-19T11:08:00.000Z	TurtleSoup	Dr_Willis	 compiz --repalace "xterm Xt error: Can't open display: %s"  and metacity --replace "Window manager error: Unable to open X display". Not sure what these mean?
2010-09-19T11:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TurtleSoup	 sounds like something very weird crashed. it may be best to just reboot.
2010-09-19T11:09:00.000Z	TurtleSoup	Dr_Willis	I've rebooted several times. The other users on the system work fine, just the one which tried to open 81 workspaces.
2010-09-19T11:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TurtleSoup	 perhaps its time to reset your desktop settings,. you could start with the panels.
2010-09-19T11:15:00.000Z	TurtleSoup	Dr_Willis	no dice. Do you know if there's a way to set the number of workspaces via terminal?
2010-09-19T11:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TurtleSoup	 its in a gconf setting somewhere.. personally i would reset all teh gnome settings by deleting the various .gnome* and .gconf* directories.. and start with a clean desktop
2010-09-19T11:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TurtleSoup	 there may be some '.compiz' directories somewhere also with settings for it.
2010-09-19T11:17:00.000Z	TurtleSoup	Dr_Willis	if I nuke .gnome*, uh, what do I do after that? :\
2010-09-19T11:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TurtleSoup	 log out/back in - it should reset gnome back to the defaults.. you DO understand this will delete all your gnome settings...
2010-09-19T11:17:00.000Z	TurtleSoup	Dr_Willis	of course.
2010-09-19T11:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TurtleSoup	  the settings are  getting a bit scattered in ways these days.. but its better then it was years ago at least.
2010-09-19T11:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TurtleSoup	 i tend to use 'mc' from a console to clean out these things.   im not sure if removeing the settings while running gnome is that good an idea.
2010-09-19T11:19:00.000Z	TurtleSoup	Dr_Willis	I've dropped to a terminal.
2010-09-19T11:23:00.000Z	TurtleSoup	Dr_Willis	that did the trick! Thanks loads for your help, I appreciate it.
2010-09-19T11:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TurtleSoup	 the 'ubuntu-tweak' tool is supposed to have some sort of 'archive your settings' feature that lets you restore back to a known point. BUt ive not tried/seen the feature yet.
2010-09-19T11:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TurtleSoup	 it would be nioce if therre was some tool included in ubuntu to let you reset the 'core' settings that often cause issues
