2009-10-25T22:46:00.000Z	rapha		Hi!
2009-10-25T22:46:00.000Z	rapha		I'm trying to install Ubuntu on a friend's computer but once I boot the Live CD the computer locks hard
2009-10-25T22:46:00.000Z	rapha		can you help?
2009-10-25T22:47:00.000Z	rapha		(i.e. the num lock and scroll lock led's start blinking and the mouse and keyboard stop responding)
2009-10-25T22:48:00.000Z	zlobi_82	rapha	is this PC booting ok with another boot disk? Have you tested the install CD?
2009-10-25T22:48:00.000Z	rapha	zlobi_82	it's a USB stick ... let me go and test it
2009-10-25T22:51:00.000Z	rapha	zlobi_82	"Check finished: no errors found"
2009-10-25T22:51:00.000Z	zlobi_82	rapha	is the PC set in BIOS to boot from USB?
2009-10-25T22:51:00.000Z	rapha	zlobi_82	er ... if it wasn't i could hardly boot it from the usb stick, could i?
2009-10-25T22:52:00.000Z	rapha	zlobi_82	i was using the boot menu (F9 on this PC)
2009-10-25T22:52:00.000Z	rapha	zlobi_82	it locks up only after the login sound has played
2009-10-25T22:52:00.000Z	zlobi_82	rapha	Well, you said it was freezing, not that you are getting any signs of boot
2009-10-25T22:52:00.000Z	rapha	zlobi_82	my wording was "once i boot" - sorry, might have been badly worded
2009-10-25T22:53:00.000Z	rapha	zlobi_82	when i "try ubuntu" the lock-up comes after the login sound. when i do "install ubuntu" right from the boot prompt, then the lock-up comes after i chose language & time zone
2009-10-25T22:53:00.000Z	zlobi_82	rapha	sorry, do not have other ideas, perhaps starting in fail-safe
2009-10-25T22:54:00.000Z	rapha	zlobi_82	k trying but it looks like the graphics driver was okay
2009-10-25T22:54:00.000Z	zlobi_82	rapha	try to reformat / /home and swap if possible
2009-10-25T22:55:00.000Z	rapha	zlobi_82	its not yet installed. thanks for your help but your suggestions seem to indicate that you didnt rly read what my problem is.
2009-10-25T22:57:00.000Z	rapha	zlobi_82	i removed the PCI WLAN card now as graphics and sound seem to work fine, so that's the only extension card left that might be a problem
2009-10-25T23:07:00.000Z	rapha	zlobi_82	looks like the PCI WLAN card is the culprit ... that would also explain why the connection is intermittent under Win XP ... I've removed it for the time being
2009-10-25T23:08:00.000Z	zlobi_82	rapha	glad that I helped :D
