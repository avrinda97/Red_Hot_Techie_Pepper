2008-04-04T00:02:00.000Z	Troofy		how to chant apt to use a proxy instead , to download apps?
2008-04-04T00:04:00.000Z	soundray	Troofy	set a variable like this: export http_proxy="http://some.url.com"
2008-04-04T00:05:00.000Z	Troofy	soundray	how to undo if i have done it already?
2008-04-04T00:05:00.000Z	soundray	Troofy	if you want this permanently, you can add the variable setting to /etc/environment
2008-04-04T00:05:00.000Z	soundray	Troofy	undo: export http_proxy=''
2008-04-04T00:06:00.000Z	soundray	Troofy	or just end the bash shell - export only works on the current shell session
2008-04-04T00:06:00.000Z	Troofy	soundray	i think i have entered it in a file. i cant remeber where/.
2008-04-04T00:07:00.000Z	Troofy	soundray	i think i have entered it in a file. i cant remeber where/.
2008-04-04T00:07:00.000Z	soundray	Troofy	'cd /etc ; grep http_proxy *'
2008-04-04T00:07:00.000Z	soundray	Troofy	or maybe you've added it to $HOME/.bashrc
2008-04-04T00:07:00.000Z	Troofy	soundray	bash.bashrc:export http_proxy=http://192.168.3.3:8080/
2008-04-04T00:08:00.000Z	soundray	Troofy	so delete it from there and reboot
2008-04-04T00:09:00.000Z	Troofy	soundray	del from where?
2008-04-04T00:09:00.000Z	soundray	Troofy	/etc/bash.bashrc
2008-04-04T00:09:00.000Z	Troofy	soundray	ok
2008-04-04T00:11:00.000Z	Troofy	soundray	thanks. it works now i gues. :)
2008-04-04T00:11:00.000Z	soundray	Troofy	to check what the variable is currently set to, do a 'echo $http_proxy'
2008-04-04T00:12:00.000Z	Troofy	soundray	hmm. i got to learn linux commandline.... where can i make a start with fantastic tutorials?
