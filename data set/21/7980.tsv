2006-07-23T14:38:00.000Z	Paladine	okiaro	you need to go to system>preferences>keyboard>layout options tab and set the second one down Alt/Win Key behaviour I think

2006-07-23T14:39:00.000Z	Paladine	okiaro	what keyboard model do you have listed under the layouts tab?
2006-07-23T14:40:00.000Z	okiaro	Paladine	Keyboard model unknown and when i click '...', there os nothing listed
2006-07-23T14:41:00.000Z	Paladine	okiaro	is the keyboard working at all?
2006-07-23T14:41:00.000Z	okiaro	Paladine	most of it... not the numpad or any 'special' buttons
2006-07-23T14:42:00.000Z	Paladine	okiaro	it looks like you have no keyboards installed so it is defaulting to a basic minimum, gimmie a sec
