2008-05-24T04:24:00.000Z	thespecialone200		Need some emergency help here
2008-05-24T04:25:00.000Z	thespecialone200		When i boot up, and X starts, the screen says "out of range"...
2008-05-24T04:25:00.000Z	thespecialone200		I need to change the resolution of X before booting up ubuntu , because the resolution is probably set wrong for my monitor... How can i do this=
2008-05-24T04:25:00.000Z	thespecialone200		?
2008-05-24T04:26:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	thespecialone200	depends on what graphics card you got, meaning ati or nvidia?
2008-05-24T04:28:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	thespecialone200	which makes it a little harder, you might need to edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-05-24T04:28:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	thespecialone200	what about the screen resolution in the menu?
2008-05-24T04:29:00.000Z	thespecialone200	remoteCTRL	i tried "fix X" in recovery mode, it didnt work. probed my gf card, but still that "out of range" message on my monitor.
2008-05-24T04:29:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	thespecialone200	edit that xorg.conf of yours and kick out exotic resolutions like 1400x1050 and such
2008-05-24T04:30:00.000Z	thespecialone200	remoteCTRL	ok then how do i edit that? need to get into console somehow
2008-05-24T04:30:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	thespecialone200	press crtl+f2
2008-05-24T04:31:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	thespecialone200	then use a editor of choice to edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-05-24T04:31:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	thespecialone200	uuuh sry ctrl+alt+f2 of course
2008-05-24T04:32:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	thespecialone200	change back to your graphics console with ctrl+alt+f7 but you need to restart gdm before that in order to the changes to have effect
2008-05-24T04:33:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	thespecialone200	well what editor do you use usually? like nano or joey or mcedit...?
2008-05-24T04:33:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	thespecialone200	and yes you need to use sudo in order to open that file writable
2008-05-24T04:36:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	thespecialone200	what do you mean by that?
2008-05-24T04:38:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	thespecialone200	well thatll not lead you to far as the file is not located in c: but as i am writing for the third time now in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-05-24T04:39:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	thespecialone200	yes for example
2008-05-24T04:40:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	thespecialone200	np good luck and good night, hehe
