2011-04-02T06:49:00.000Z	truepurple_		Someone had me comment out a line using sudo vi /etc/resolv.conf, how do I remove the comment out, anyone know?

2011-04-02T06:50:00.000Z	truepurple_		what button deletes a character? Surprisingly not backspace

2011-04-02T06:57:00.000Z	shcherbak	truepurple_	then v (visual mode)
2011-04-02T06:57:00.000Z	shcherbak	truepurple_	highlight what you do not want and d
2011-04-02T07:00:00.000Z	truepurple_	shcherbak	That V thing doesn't seem to work, but it doesn't seem necessary anyway
2011-04-02T07:05:00.000Z	truepurple_	shcherbak	So with the full version of this program, these commands will make more sense?
2011-04-02T07:06:00.000Z	shcherbak	truepurple_	Should, use vim (vi impoved), much easier and nice features. you may need to get vim cheatsheet, much help.
2011-04-02T07:07:00.000Z	truepurple_	shcherbak	How do I get the improved version?
2011-04-02T07:09:00.000Z	shcherbak	truepurple_	sudo apt-get install vim
2011-04-02T07:10:00.000Z	shcherbak	truepurple_	My favourite: http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/vi-guide.xml
2011-04-02T07:12:00.000Z	truepurple_	shcherbak	Someone had me comment this line out with nameserver 205.171.3.65, could that have any negative effects, a bit of slow down or anything? What is the purpose of that line?

2011-04-02T07:15:00.000Z	shcherbak	truepurple_	what nameserver are you using?
2011-04-02T07:16:00.000Z	truepurple_	shcherbak	I don't know enough to answer that question
2011-04-02T07:17:00.000Z	shcherbak	truepurple_	In /etc/resolv.conf, what other lines do you have (should be your router, if you have one)
2011-04-02T07:25:00.000Z	shcherbak	truepurple_	Anyway, all DNS is done automaticaly in Ubuntu, so no worries, if you want to experiment a bit, mind a back up and common sens, google "public name server" to see what you can play with.
2011-04-02T07:26:00.000Z	truepurple_	shcherbak	I don't trust ubuntu to do everything automatically, it already screwed up my internet once already
