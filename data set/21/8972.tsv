2006-02-28T14:06:00.000Z	viller	thegladiator	i know what's a launcher, but which command is for executeing?
2006-02-28T14:06:00.000Z	thegladiator	viller	in the dektop right click , creat launcher and give the necessary command for that
2006-02-28T14:07:00.000Z	thegladiator	viller	in case of launchers you can just click and it is executed
2006-02-28T14:07:00.000Z	thegladiator	viller	but what sort of app is this , normally how do you run it ?
2006-02-28T14:07:00.000Z	thegladiator	viller	you go to the folder and click what?
2006-02-28T14:07:00.000Z	viller	thegladiator	blender.bin
2006-02-28T14:07:00.000Z	viller	thegladiator	well it's just blender in nautilus
2006-02-28T14:08:00.000Z	thegladiator	viller	alright viller normally you just go into the directory and go to cmd line and type ./blender.bin right ?
2006-02-28T14:08:00.000Z	viller	thegladiator	yes
2006-02-28T14:09:00.000Z	thegladiator	viller	and now what do you want to achieve ?
2006-02-28T14:09:00.000Z	thegladiator	viller	i am unclear as to what you want to achieve , you want to tun it with a click or something ?
2006-02-28T14:11:00.000Z	viller	thegladiator	i figured out that i can just type the path to the file in launcher properties
2006-02-28T14:11:00.000Z	viller	thegladiator	thanks anyway
