2008-01-02T20:40:00.000Z	family		Hey guys, sound doesn't seem to be working anymore after upgrading to gutsy. What can I do to troubleshoot?
2008-01-02T20:41:00.000Z	ynef	family	well, what sound card do you have and do you know what module was used in the previous version?
2008-01-02T20:42:00.000Z	family	ynef	alsa was used before, and it's onboard AC'97 Sound Controller
2008-01-02T20:43:00.000Z	ynef	family	sounds simple enough for ubuntu to support -- do you have access to it via the mixer, or is it simply "not there"?
2008-01-02T20:44:00.000Z	family	ynef	It's there, it's just not playing any sound what-so-ever
2008-01-02T20:44:00.000Z	ynef	family	and it's not so simple that it's just muted or turned really low on "PCM" or something?
2008-01-02T20:44:00.000Z	family	ynef	It did work with fiesty, and then the upgrade to gutsy seems to have broken it
2008-01-02T20:44:00.000Z	family	ynef	no definitely not
2008-01-02T20:45:00.000Z	family	ynef	Actually the device is caling itself SiS SI7012. Dunno why
2008-01-02T20:45:00.000Z	ynef	family	well, maybe you can figure out if others are having the same problem -- see what "lspci" is calling it (might be different from what you get via the mixer)
2008-01-02T20:46:00.000Z	family	ynef	00:02.7 Multimedia audio controller: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] AC'97 Sound Controller (rev a0)
2008-01-02T20:47:00.000Z	ynef	family	well, shoot. :-( so, no others are having that problem, right?
2008-01-02T20:47:00.000Z	family	ynef	Not sure. was curious if it was a common problem
2008-01-02T20:47:00.000Z	family	ynef	I'm not even sure where to begin troubleshooting
2008-01-02T20:50:00.000Z	ynef	family	check with lsmod to see which module the soundcard is using, then, using that info, hit google and possibly alsa-project.org and see if you can get further info
2008-01-02T20:55:00.000Z	family	ynef	Found a new error.
2008-01-02T20:57:00.000Z	family	ynef	System > Pref > Sounds, when i try to test sounds i get 'failed to contruct test pipeline for 'gconfausiosrc ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! gconfaudiosink profile=chat'
2008-01-02T20:57:00.000Z	ynef	family	really strange.... you said this was an update, not a fresh install of gutsy?
2008-01-02T20:58:00.000Z	ynef	family	upgrade, even
2008-01-02T20:58:00.000Z	family	ynef	right. and i know there are problems associated with upgrades, but it's a little.... better
2008-01-02T20:58:00.000Z	family	ynef	rather than have to transfer all the files necessary after I'd jhave a fresh install
