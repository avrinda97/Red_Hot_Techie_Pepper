2006-01-13T17:44:00.000Z	UncleDz	crimsun	does ubuntu do backporting, where they fix bugs in new versions of say, php5.1.1 in the ver 5.0.5 that comes w/ ubuntu?
2006-01-13T17:45:00.000Z	crimsun	UncleDz	very, very rarely are non-security fixes backported
2006-01-13T17:45:00.000Z	UncleDz	crimsun	so, i should edit my sources.list
2006-01-13T17:48:00.000Z	UncleDz	crimsun	how about changing my sources.list to see latest version of php?
2006-01-13T17:48:00.000Z	crimsun	UncleDz	you don't necessarily get the latest
2006-01-13T17:49:00.000Z	UncleDz	crimsun	i know php5.0.5 is a version on ubuntu right now
2006-01-13T17:49:00.000Z	UncleDz	crimsun	5.1.1 seems more recent
2006-01-13T17:49:00.000Z	crimsun	UncleDz	unless there's a compelling reason to migrate to 5.1.1, I wouldn't.
2006-01-13T17:50:00.000Z	crimsun	UncleDz	"it's newer" is /not/ a compelling enough reason
2006-01-13T06:05:00.000Z	UncleDz	crimsun	Why must apache2-common be installed if i want to install php5?
2006-01-13T06:06:00.000Z	crimsun	UncleDz	because it's dependency
2006-01-13T06:09:00.000Z	UncleDz	crimsun	how do you feel about adduser-ng - useful?
2006-01-13T06:09:00.000Z	crimsun	UncleDz	I'm not familiar w/ it
2006-01-13T06:13:00.000Z	crimsun	UncleDz	postfix
2006-01-13T06:14:00.000Z	UncleDz	crimsun	hows postfix compared to courier?
2006-01-13T06:14:00.000Z	crimsun	UncleDz	easier to configure and higher-performance
2006-01-13T06:24:00.000Z	UncleDz	crimsun	do you recommend dovtecot+postfix?
2006-01-13T06:25:00.000Z	crimsun	UncleDz	I've heard it's a winning combination, but I can't personally vouch for it.
2006-01-13T06:43:00.000Z	UncleDz	crimsun	How do i install java sdk 1.5?
2006-01-13T06:43:00.000Z	crimsun	UncleDz	ask the bot about java
2006-01-13T06:58:00.000Z	UncleDz	crimsun	ty for the help
