2005-07-13T12:13:00.000Z	jasoncohen		does anyone know how to start gnome from vnc. gnome-session & doesn't work
2005-07-13T12:14:00.000Z	rabies	jasoncohen	you gotta stick /usr/bin/gnome-session in the vnc config file
2005-07-13T12:14:00.000Z	rabies	jasoncohen	i forget what its called...some . file in your home dir
2005-07-13T12:14:00.000Z	jasoncohen	rabies	already done
2005-07-13T12:14:00.000Z	jasoncohen	rabies	/home/username/.vnc/xstartup you mean
2005-07-13T12:14:00.000Z	rabies	jasoncohen	is gnome workin w/o vnc?
2005-07-13T12:14:00.000Z	jasoncohen	rabies	and i can start kde with startkde &
2005-07-13T12:14:00.000Z	rabies	jasoncohen	so startkde works under vnc?
2005-07-13T12:14:00.000Z	jasoncohen	rabies	i can use vino - but i want to have a virtual session
2005-07-13T12:15:00.000Z	jasoncohen	rabies	yes
2005-07-13T12:15:00.000Z	rabies	jasoncohen	try using tightvnc or one of the other ones
2005-07-13T12:15:00.000Z	rabies	jasoncohen	might be a realvnc specific issue
2005-07-13T12:15:00.000Z	rabies	jasoncohen	or visa-versa
2005-07-13T12:16:00.000Z	jasoncohen	rabies	ok
2005-07-13T12:18:00.000Z	jasoncohen	rabies	both realvnc & tightvnc work with kde but neither will start gnome with gnome-session &
2005-07-13T12:19:00.000Z	rabies	jasoncohen	are you just putting in gnome-session, or the absolute path?
2005-07-13T12:20:00.000Z	rabies	jasoncohen	yeah, but relying on $PATH isnt recomended
2005-07-13T12:20:00.000Z	rabies	jasoncohen	how are you starting vnc?
2005-07-13T12:21:00.000Z	jasoncohen	rabies	with vncserver as a user
2005-07-13T12:21:00.000Z	rabies	jasoncohen	it really sounds like a gnome specific issue, irc.gimp.org has most of the gnome devs in there, they might know something
2005-07-13T12:33:00.000Z	rabies	jasoncohen	=\
