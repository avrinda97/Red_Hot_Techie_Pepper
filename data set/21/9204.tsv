2007-10-22T16:28:00.000Z	MenZa	kbrooks	Delayed by two months because stuff had to be finished?
2007-10-22T16:28:00.000Z	MenZa	kbrooks	Remember Dapper? 6.06?
2007-10-22T16:28:00.000Z	kbrooks	MenZa	yes? go on
2007-10-22T16:28:00.000Z	kbrooks	MenZa	no. he does not have to reinstall.
2007-10-22T16:29:00.000Z	MenZa	kbrooks	No. Supergrub will fix it.
2007-10-22T16:29:00.000Z	kbrooks	MenZa	um, reread what i said
2007-10-22T16:29:00.000Z	MenZa	kbrooks	What am I supposed to re-read?
2007-10-22T16:29:00.000Z	kbrooks	MenZa	i said that you were wrong in saying that he has to "install windows, then insert this disk"
2007-10-22T16:30:00.000Z	MenZa	kbrooks	How is that wrong?
2007-10-22T16:30:00.000Z	MenZa	kbrooks	that's blacklisted kernel modules, not cards blacklisted from Compiz :p
2007-10-22T16:30:00.000Z	kbrooks	MenZa	there is a  option in grub that lets you do what i just explained to him about.
2007-10-22T16:30:00.000Z	MenZa	kbrooks	Yes, there is. Re-installation of Grub.
2007-10-22T16:31:00.000Z	MenZa	kbrooks	It's much more user-friendly to pop in a disk, hit enter once, reboot and have it working.
2007-10-22T16:31:00.000Z	kbrooks	MenZa	oh sorry, i thougght you meant REINSTALLATION of windows
2007-10-22T16:31:00.000Z	MenZa	kbrooks	I figured it was something like that. :)
2007-10-22T16:48:00.000Z	kbrooks	MenZa	no.
