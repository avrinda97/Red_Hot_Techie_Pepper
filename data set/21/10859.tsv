2004-11-06T11:36:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		dude
2004-11-06T11:36:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		not fair
2004-11-06T11:36:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		come on.
2004-11-06T11:36:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		how the hell do I install the Nuvola theme in gnome
2004-11-06T11:36:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		and chunks of crap are missing
2004-11-06T11:36:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		I don't know how much of Gnome I have
2004-11-06T11:36:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		it installed without gnome-panel or nautilus
2004-11-06T11:36:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		or metacity
2004-11-06T11:36:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		so it installed basically nothing
2004-11-06T11:37:00.000Z	joem	bluefoxicy	try to install the ubuntu-desktop package
2004-11-06T11:37:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	joem	 is that wise?
2004-11-06T11:38:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	joem	 how much space will it require
2004-11-06T11:49:00.000Z	joem	bluefoxicy	no, it does
2004-11-06T11:49:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	joem	 not for me.
2004-11-06T11:49:00.000Z	joem	bluefoxicy	at a quick glance, I can see libgtk depending on xlibs
2004-11-06T11:50:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	joem	 yes, it does want xlibs
2004-11-06T11:50:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	joem	 xlibs is not an x server.
2004-11-06T11:50:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	joem	 It needs an X server.  xlibs let you talk to an xserver, like kdrive or xorg-x11 or xfree86
2004-11-06T11:52:00.000Z	joem	bluefoxicy	something was obviously wrong with your install, since you were missing lots of gnome components as well
2004-11-06T11:52:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	joem	 custom install.  I didn't have the 1.8G so I started from scratch
2004-11-06T11:52:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	joem	 But I expect it to actually install an X server when i tell it I want gnome
