2005-12-28T13:42:00.000Z	M3G4		the system generally crawls - from window rendering to actually launching applications
2005-12-28T13:43:00.000Z	M3G4		I'll add some more RAM In the new year then
2005-12-28T13:43:00.000Z	M3G4		but until then it'll have to plod along like this. what sort of RAM would be optimal for this PC?
2005-12-28T13:43:00.000Z	M3G4		256?
2005-12-28T13:44:00.000Z	M3G4		512MB for a 1GHz machine?
2005-12-28T13:44:00.000Z	M3G4		isn't that overkill?
2005-12-28T13:44:00.000Z	M3G4		and generally slow performance :p
2005-12-28T13:45:00.000Z	M3G4		pashow - how do i find out?
2005-12-28T13:45:00.000Z	M3G4		blanky- mines only a 1GHz but even windows runs faster than this
2005-12-28T13:45:00.000Z	M3G4		lol my new dell has 1GB of RAM
2005-12-28T13:46:00.000Z	navarone	M3G4	I have Athlon 1.2ghz and adding another 256mb means never using swap in my experience
2005-12-28T13:47:00.000Z	navarone	M3G4	yeah...it's crawling cos it is reading off slow drive instead of fast ram
2005-12-28T13:48:00.000Z	M3G4	navarone	- the hard drive light is hardly ever lit - i dont think its swapping
2005-12-28T13:49:00.000Z	navarone	M3G4	well if you can afford it...extra memory will not go wrong
2005-12-28T13:50:00.000Z	navarone	M3G4	386 kernel?
2005-12-28T13:50:00.000Z	M3G4	navarone	- no, Linux kernal#
2005-12-28T13:51:00.000Z	navarone	M3G4	I have asus mb with athlon 1.2 512mb ram and geforce3 vidcard...not much different than you
2005-12-28T13:53:00.000Z	navarone	M3G4	does it recognize correct vidcard in device manager?
2005-12-28T13:53:00.000Z	M3G4	navarone	- it calls it by it's name, yes
2005-12-28T13:55:00.000Z	navarone	M3G4	is this a fresh install?
2005-12-28T13:55:00.000Z	M3G4	navarone	- no, dualbooting with xp, installed 2 days ago
