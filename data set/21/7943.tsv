2006-09-18T07:31:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker		hey. can someone tell me how to upgrade my automake from 1.4 to 1.9?
2006-09-18T07:31:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker		sudo apt-get install automake1.9 didn't seem to make the change take effect in kdevelop.
2006-09-18T07:32:00.000Z	jrib	tuxtheslacker	sudo update-alternatives --config automake
2006-09-18T07:33:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	jrib	I did sudo apt-get upgrade automake... what will that do?
2006-09-18T07:34:00.000Z	jrib	tuxtheslacker	that will try to upgrade all the packages on your system
2006-09-18T07:34:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	jrib	I did sudo apt-get upgrade automake... what will that do?
2006-09-18T07:34:00.000Z	jrib	tuxtheslacker	that will try to upgrade all the packages on your system
2006-09-18T07:36:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	jrib	thanks!
2006-09-18T07:45:00.000Z	jrib	tuxtheslacker	you probably need libx11-dev
2006-09-18T07:45:00.000Z	jrib	tuxtheslacker	what are you compiling?
2006-09-18T07:45:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	jrib	I'm trying to compile a simple program application... Trying to figure out how to use Qt :-)
2006-09-18T07:46:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	jrib	libx11-dev is already installed.
2006-09-18T07:48:00.000Z	jrib	tuxtheslacker	I'm not sure of the package then, check the configure script to see how it checks for the X includes, and then find the package that gives you that file
2006-11-04T16:22:00.000Z	jrib	tuxtheslacker	there is a panel applet.  There is also a gdesklet
2006-11-04T16:22:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	jrib	what is gdesklet?
2006-11-04T16:23:00.000Z	jrib	tuxtheslacker	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDesklets
2006-11-04T16:23:00.000Z	jrib	tuxtheslacker	you can even see the weather one in the screenshot there
2006-11-04T16:24:00.000Z	jrib	tuxtheslacker	to install them you would just install the 'gdesklets' package from universe, using synaptic for example
2006-11-04T16:25:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	jrib	I am installing gdesklets now... how would I go about adding and removing widgets?
2006-11-04T16:25:00.000Z	jrib	tuxtheslacker	I don't really use it, but you should get a menu item somewhere
2006-11-04T16:25:00.000Z	tuxtheslacker	jrib	oh okay :-)
