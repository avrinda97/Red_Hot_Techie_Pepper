2006-03-23T06:08:00.000Z	Celestianpower		Why doesn't the link to inform that I added to the menu work? The link goes to /usr/bin/inform and I installed Inform via Synaptic
2006-03-23T06:10:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Celestianpower	what do you get for 'which inform'
2006-03-23T06:11:00.000Z	Celestianpower	Frogzoo	/usr/bin/inform
2006-03-23T06:11:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Celestianpower	well, try 'inform'
2006-03-23T06:14:00.000Z	Celestianpower	Frogzoo	http://paste.uni.cc/8754
2006-03-23T06:16:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Celestianpower	I think you don't want a link - you need to create a launcher, with the command something like, gnome-terminal /usr/bin/inform'
2006-03-23T06:18:00.000Z	Celestianpower	Frogzoo	Still nothing
2006-03-23T06:18:00.000Z	Celestianpower	Frogzoo	From when I used it in Windows, the "inform" command compiled the code
2006-03-23T06:20:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Celestianpower	this is a text based app, yes?
2006-03-23T06:20:00.000Z	Celestianpower	Frogzoo	Yes
2006-03-23T06:21:00.000Z	Celestianpower	Frogzoo	The pastebin was from typing inform
2006-03-23T06:59:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Celestianpower	ubotu is a bot, btw - it's not a very good conversationalist, despite appearances
2006-03-23T06:59:00.000Z	Celestianpower	Frogzoo	Yes ;)
2007-07-24T09:25:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Celestianpower	tbh, you'd do best to just clean install from here
2007-07-24T09:25:00.000Z	Celestianpower	Frogzoo	How do I do that?
2007-07-24T09:25:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Celestianpower	download the feisty cd - insert & install
2007-07-24T09:26:00.000Z	Celestianpower	Frogzoo	I don't understand - I can't download a CD?
2007-07-24T09:27:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Celestianpower	you can't boot off the dapper cd?
2007-07-24T09:28:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Celestianpower	still doesn't help unless you've 2 cds
2007-07-24T09:28:00.000Z	Celestianpower	Frogzoo	I don't have a Dapper CD
2007-07-24T09:28:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Celestianpower	well beg/borrow/steal a feisty cd is still your easiest option
