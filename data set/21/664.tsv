2011-08-22T23:28:00.000Z	blognewb		hello?'
2011-08-22T23:29:00.000Z	urlin2u	blognewb	you need plop cd to boot the usb.
2011-08-22T23:30:00.000Z	blognewb	urlin2u	that's what it is but my question was, does my usb driver have to only have the ubuntu iso to load or can i have other documents in it, it's not a usb stick that im gonna be using but an external hard drive via USB
2011-08-22T23:30:00.000Z	urlin2u	blognewb	have you ever used a usb to install with?
2011-08-22T23:32:00.000Z	blognewb	urlin2u	to boot an os? no
2011-08-22T23:33:00.000Z	urlin2u	blognewb	is the usb a pendrive or a hard drive?
2011-08-22T23:34:00.000Z	blognewb	urlin2u	hard drive with the ubuntu iso and other files in it, like a typical internal hard drive. WHat will be the .ini file?
2011-08-22T23:35:00.000Z	urlin2u	blognewb	not a good way to try to install, works on occasion fails in others. Do you have a pendrive to use or a cd to burn and a reader?
2011-08-22T23:36:00.000Z	blognewb	urlin2u	reader?
2011-08-22T23:36:00.000Z	blognewb	urlin2u	im trying to look for a blank cd but all seems to be occupied
2011-08-22T23:37:00.000Z	urlin2u	blognewb	can your computer your installing to read=reader a cd, and can you burn one.
2011-08-22T23:40:00.000Z	blognewb	urlin2u	i can burn in this laptop yes but no blank cdr so far
2011-08-22T23:40:00.000Z	urlin2u	blognewb	do you have a pendrive, using the hard drive is more than just putting a ISO on it.
2011-08-22T23:41:00.000Z	blognewb	urlin2u	pendrive like a usb stick? no
2011-08-22T23:43:00.000Z	urlin2u	blognewb	are you sure that the computer will not bot a usb, how old is the compute?
2011-08-22T23:45:00.000Z	blognewb	urlin2u	becausae it doesn't have a usb option in the bios
2011-08-22T23:46:00.000Z	urlin2u	blognewb	okay, to be honest using a plop cd to boot a HD to install with is not easy and may fail. Do you even have plop on a cd?
2011-09-22T04:06:00.000Z	urlin2u	blognewb	how would we know.
2011-09-22T05:14:00.000Z	urlin2u	blognewb	not a ubuntu issue.
2012-01-29T00:10:00.000Z	urlin2u	blognewb	there is a #libreoffice channel as well if needed.
