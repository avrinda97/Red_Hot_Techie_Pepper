2008-06-05T06:36:00.000Z	nikonadictk		hey biggggg problem: apache does not have permission to do anything to my /var/www/ folder, how do I fix this, I did chown -R root:wwwusers 771 /var/www and I just want to add apache to have the ability to access this folder
2008-06-05T06:36:00.000Z	nikonadictk		any body, help
2008-06-05T06:37:00.000Z	Starnestommy	nikonadictk	try sudo chown -R www-data.www-data /var/www
2008-06-05T06:37:00.000Z	nikonadictk	Starnestommy	will that messup my previous permission setup or will it just add apache to the owners
2008-06-05T06:38:00.000Z	Starnestommy	nikonadictk	it makes apache the owner
2008-06-05T06:39:00.000Z	nikonadictk		yes but I also need the group wwwusers to have permission to it as well
2008-06-05T06:40:00.000Z	nikonadictk		Starnestommy??
2008-06-05T06:41:00.000Z	Starnestommy	nikonadictk	files can only be owned by one user and one group at a time
2008-06-05T06:41:00.000Z	nikonadictk		can I have it owned by the group wwwusers
2008-06-05T06:41:00.000Z	nikonadictk		and just put www-data user in the group wwwusers
2008-06-05T06:41:00.000Z	Starnestommy	nikonadictk	the standard way to do it is owned by www-data
2008-06-05T06:41:00.000Z	Starnestommy	nikonadictk	but you can add users to that group
2008-06-05T06:42:00.000Z	nikonadictk	Starnestommy	how would I make a whole group the owner
2008-06-05T06:42:00.000Z	nikonadictk	Starnestommy	because www-data is a member of the wwwusers group
2008-06-05T06:42:00.000Z	nikonadictk		so if I just made the wwwusers group the owner Starnestommy then it should work right?
2008-06-05T06:42:00.000Z	nikonadictk		is that posible thorugh Starnestommy
2008-06-05T06:42:00.000Z	Starnestommy	nikonadictk	it should
2008-06-05T06:42:00.000Z	nikonadictk	Starnestommy	how would I go abut making the wwwusers group the owner of /var/www
2008-06-05T06:43:00.000Z	Starnestommy	nikonadictk	sudo chgrp -R wwwusers /var/www
2008-06-05T06:43:00.000Z	Starnestommy	nikonadictk	or sudo chown -R www-data.wwwusers /var/www
2008-06-05T06:44:00.000Z	nikonadictk	Starnestommy	it worked! thanks buddy your a life saver i REALLY REALLY apreciate it
