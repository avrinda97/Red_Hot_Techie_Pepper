2004-11-01T15:49:00.000Z	torpor		Wow, I really am stoked.  This is really impressive guys.  UBUNTU on my Powerbook ... really rockin' !!!!!
2004-11-01T15:50:00.000Z	torpor		i just can't get over it.
2004-11-01T15:51:00.000Z	torpor		even frickin' Airport works, and was smooth as hell to set up, WEP and all.
2004-11-01T15:51:00.000Z	torpor		damn.
2004-11-01T15:51:00.000Z	Juerd_	torpor	You appear to be more lucky than I :)
2004-11-01T15:51:00.000Z	torpor		now i just gotta try and Grok the Debian Way ...
2004-11-01T15:51:00.000Z	Juerd_	torpor	The Debian way is mostly "apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade" :)
2004-11-01T15:51:00.000Z	torpor		(I'm a tarball-install kinda guy, I don't mind running autogen.sh by hand...)
2004-11-01T15:52:00.000Z	torpor		i know nothing about apt-get yet.
2004-11-01T15:52:00.000Z	torpor	Juerd_	you trying to install on a Powerbook?
2004-11-01T15:52:00.000Z	Juerd_	torpor	No, an intel box
2004-11-01T15:53:00.000Z	Juerd_	torpor	Here's the apt-get quick introduction: "apt-cache search foo" searches for foo
2004-11-01T15:53:00.000Z	Juerd_	torpor	"apt-get install foo" installs foo, "apt-get update" updates the local package lists
2004-11-01T15:53:00.000Z	torpor	Juerd_	cool, similar to emerge then.
2004-11-01T15:54:00.000Z	Juerd_	torpor	"apt-get dist-upgrade" upgrades the entire distribution, "dpkg -S foo" searches for the installed package that contains the file foo
2004-11-01T15:54:00.000Z	torpor		much easier than CRUX.
2004-11-01T15:54:00.000Z	Juerd_		"dpkg -L foo" gives a list of files in the installed foo package
2004-11-01T15:55:00.000Z	torpor		so i've just installed Warty - do i need to 'apt-get dist-upgrade' now, or am i pretty much current?
2004-11-01T15:55:00.000Z	Juerd_		"dpkg -i foo.deb" manually installs a .deb package, "dpkg --force-all -i" is the easiest way to destroy your otherwise perfectly functioning system, so never do a --force-all.
2004-11-01T15:55:00.000Z	Juerd_	torpor	It doesn't hurt to try.
2004-11-01T15:55:00.000Z	Juerd_	torpor	update before you upgrade. update updates the package database
