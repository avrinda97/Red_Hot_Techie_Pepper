2006-01-13T15:58:00.000Z	narles		know how to fix this?
2006-01-13T16:00:00.000Z	timfrost	narles	is blank.tar.gz in the current directory?  If not, you need to type the full path name
2006-01-13T16:01:00.000Z	narles	timfrost	the tar.gz is on my desktop.. what kind of command should i use to extract it to the directory i'm in
2006-01-13T16:02:00.000Z	timfrost	narles	try tar xzf ~/Desktop/blank.tar.gz
2006-01-13T16:03:00.000Z	narles	timfrost	thanks
2006-01-16T09:26:00.000Z	timfrost	narles	whatr error are you getting?
2006-01-16T09:26:00.000Z	narles	timfrost	i don't know how to create the gtkpod.out file in /gtkpod
2006-01-16T09:27:00.000Z	timfrost	narles	try 'gedit ~/.gtkpod/gtkpod.out'
2006-01-16T09:27:00.000Z	narles	timfrost	thanks
2006-01-16T09:28:00.000Z	timfrost	narles	after saving the file , you may need to make it executable with 'chmod 755  ~/.gtkpod/gtkpod.out'
2006-01-16T09:37:00.000Z	narles	timfrost	it doesn't seem that the file has been created
2006-01-16T09:38:00.000Z	timfrost	narles	does the directory  ~/.gtkpod exist (ls -ld  ~/.gtkpod)?
2006-01-16T09:39:00.000Z	narles	timfrost	i think so yes
2006-01-16T09:40:00.000Z	timfrost	narles	what does 'ls -ld  /home/daemon/.gtkpod' display?
2006-01-16T09:42:00.000Z	timfrost	narles	permissions look OK, butr why /home/daemon, rather than /home/narles?
2006-01-16T09:44:00.000Z	narles	timfrost	don't know... thanks though.. i'm gona restart and see if things fix up
