2008-06-12T12:14:00.000Z	cedriczg		oops. Jus one question while updating the kernel. It got to a question on what to do and I choosed to run a terminal to examine the situation and now the installation process got hung up. What should I do from now on? Can I install it again from zero in an easy way?
2008-06-12T12:15:00.000Z	wols_	cedriczg	yes
2008-06-12T12:15:00.000Z	cedriczg	wols_	may I ask which is the better way to reinstall?
2008-06-12T12:16:00.000Z	cedriczg	wols_	now I would even need to kill the update manager
2008-06-12T12:16:00.000Z	wols_	cedriczg	since you didn't tell what the ways are, how can I say which one is better?
2008-06-12T12:17:00.000Z	cedriczg	wols_	command line, try to use update manager again.
2008-06-12T12:17:00.000Z	wols_	cedriczg	use apt-get on a terminal
2008-06-12T12:18:00.000Z	cedriczg	wols_	ok, apt-get install <which is the last version of kernel> ?
2008-06-12T12:19:00.000Z	wols_	cedriczg	apt-cache search linux-image
2008-06-12T12:19:00.000Z	cedriczg	wols_	thank you
2008-06-12T12:19:00.000Z	wols_	cedriczg	you will have to remove the botched install or finish it with apt-get install -f  first
2008-06-12T12:20:00.000Z	cedriczg	wols_	I also had other packages being installed. How shoud I check for other botched installs?
2008-06-12T12:21:00.000Z	wols_	cedriczg	you don't need to
2008-06-12T12:21:00.000Z	cedriczg	wols_	apt-get install -f command will just finish the installation?
2008-06-12T12:26:00.000Z	cedriczg	wols_	I tried so and I got this message:
2008-06-12T12:27:00.000Z	wols_	cedriczg	I told you to paste. you don't listen: fine. good day
2008-06-12T12:29:00.000Z	cedriczg	wols_	can you help me?
2008-06-12T12:31:00.000Z	cedriczg	wols_	how can I get all the pid that were using the update manager? I need to kill them so I can run the command you told me
2008-06-12T12:40:00.000Z	wols_	cedriczg	it was. it's a security measure so that you can still boot in case the new kernel is bad
2008-06-12T12:41:00.000Z	cedriczg	wols_	ok, so after it works how do I unsintall the previous kernel? I have by now almost four available
2008-06-12T12:42:00.000Z	wols_	cedriczg	if you want to, sure
