2007-07-26T14:23:00.000Z	blackjac3l		Does "64 bit support" mean that a processor is a 64 bit processor?
2007-07-26T14:24:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	blackjac3l	if that's on the software, it means it's compiled for the amd64 instruction set
2007-07-26T14:25:00.000Z	blackjac3l	howlingmadhowie	I'm asking about the hardware.... I can't install ubuntu 64 so i'm trying to figure out if my processor isnt really 64 bit
2007-07-26T14:25:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	blackjac3l	what do you have running on the system now?
2007-07-26T14:26:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	blackjac3l	doesn't windows xp have the capability of telling you what sort of processor you have? something like 'cat /proc/cpuinfo' on linux?
2007-07-26T14:27:00.000Z	blackjac3l	howlingmadhowie	I know which processor i have, http://www.newegg.com/product/product.asp?item=N82E16819116004
2007-07-26T14:30:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	blackjac3l	according to wikipedia, it looks as if the processor does implement the AMD64 instruction set
2007-07-26T14:31:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	blackjac3l	are you using an ubuntu live cd for 64bit architecture?
2007-07-26T14:32:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	blackjac3l	and then you burnt the cd and now it doesn't boot or doesn't boot correctly from the cd?
2007-07-26T14:35:00.000Z	blackjac3l	howlingmadhowie	It dosen't boot correctly from the cd
2007-07-26T14:37:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	blackjac3l	how far does it get? when it asks if you want to boot from cd, can you edit the entry and delete "splash" and "quiet"?
2007-07-26T14:46:00.000Z	blackjac3l	howlingmadhowie	I found my exact problem on the forums, this is exactly what happens to me, described on the first post: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=491544&highlight=64+intel+amd+ubuntu+install
2007-07-26T14:47:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	blackjac3l	i'd bet on the kernel configuration on the live cd not supporting something
2007-07-26T14:48:00.000Z	blackjac3l	howlingmadhowie	why would it work on the 32 bit version but not on the 64 bit version?
2007-07-26T14:48:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	blackjac3l	but what happens if you switch off the splash screen and 'quiet' on the boot options?
2007-07-26T14:49:00.000Z	blackjac3l	howlingmadhowie	i don't know how to do that....
2007-07-26T14:49:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	blackjac3l	hang on, i'll power up my laptop and tell you exactly what to do...
2007-07-26T14:52:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	blackjac3l	okay: put the cd in the drive. wait till the screen appears where you can select what you want to do, press F6. delete 'quiet' and 'splash'. press enter
2007-07-26T14:55:00.000Z	blackjac3l	howlingmadhowie	ok i did that and absolutely nothing different happned
2007-07-26T14:56:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	blackjac3l	then something's going wrong very early in procedings. either you use the 32bit version, or you try gutsy
2007-07-26T14:59:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	blackjac3l	i you want to stick to 64-bit edgy, you can spend some time researching 'kernel options at boot time', but that will soon get extremely boring
