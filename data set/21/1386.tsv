2011-12-12T02:37:00.000Z	shadaloo		Hi! When trying to access my other HardDrives I get "Unabled to mount: Not authorized"
2011-12-12T02:38:00.000Z	shadaloo		I have some really important stuff to back up
2011-12-12T02:38:00.000Z	shadaloo		can anyone please help me
2011-12-12T02:38:00.000Z	mister	shadaloo	you need root rights
2011-12-12T02:50:00.000Z	shadaloo	mister	how do I show my hard drives
2011-12-12T02:51:00.000Z	mister	shadaloo	the best thing is to look what you got in /dev/ there are all your partitions listed
2011-12-12T02:53:00.000Z	mister	shadaloo	do that in your command line 'ls /dev/sd*'
2011-12-12T02:53:00.000Z	mister	shadaloo	without the ' ' of course ;)
2011-12-12T02:54:00.000Z	mister	shadaloo	you can use fdisk too... but it need sudo rights...
2011-12-12T02:54:00.000Z	mister	shadaloo	correct
2011-12-12T02:54:00.000Z	mister	shadaloo	but ther are tools that will do the mounting for you automatically if it is a pendrive
2011-12-12T02:55:00.000Z	mister	shadaloo	hm.... i was in your situation a looooooooong time ago... sorry i can not remeber the name... google for it a bit and you will find as i did
2011-12-12T02:56:00.000Z	mister	shadaloo	but if you need the mount only one time then forget about the tools
2011-12-12T02:56:00.000Z	shadaloo	mister	do you have any idea what the name is
2011-12-12T02:56:00.000Z	shadaloo	mister	 yes just one time
2011-12-12T02:56:00.000Z	mister	shadaloo	ok, so you want to backup files from a partition
2011-12-12T02:56:00.000Z	mister	shadaloo	did you allready mount the partition?
2011-12-12T02:57:00.000Z	mister	shadaloo	with the command you said...  sudo mount /dev/sdd1 /home/myUser/Desktop/USB
2011-12-12T02:58:00.000Z	shadaloo	mister	fermiAnyone: thank you
2011-12-12T02:58:00.000Z	shadaloo	mister	thanks very much
2011-12-12T02:59:00.000Z	mister	shadaloo	so your problem is solved?
