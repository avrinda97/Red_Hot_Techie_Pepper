2010-04-05T15:20:00.000Z	Jester05		man this is awesome..
2010-04-05T15:20:00.000Z	Jester05		just got a torrent client set up on my server box and I now have the entire thing controlled via internet connection
2010-04-05T15:21:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	Jester05	rtorrent?
2010-04-05T15:22:00.000Z	Jester05	brontosaurusrex	no.. just transmission
2010-04-05T15:22:00.000Z	Jester05		tried to set up deluge but for w/e reason it wouldn't run right at all
2010-04-05T15:22:00.000Z	Jester05		not even close to right..
2010-04-05T15:22:00.000Z	Jester05		I think it may have to do w/ a version issue
2010-04-05T15:22:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex		transmission-cli or a web interface? Jester05
2010-04-05T15:24:00.000Z	Jester05	brontosaurusrex	I can ssh into it and control it via command (if i'm on the local network I can even use the gui), but currently controlling via web
2010-04-05T15:24:00.000Z	Jester05	brontosaurusrex	whats rtorrent like
2010-04-05T15:24:00.000Z	Jester05		does it do email notification when a torrent is done?
2010-04-05T15:24:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex		rtorrent is ncurses, i just use it via ssh, dunno about mail
2010-04-05T15:25:00.000Z	Jester05		ohh
2010-04-05T15:25:00.000Z	Jester05		I liked deluge b/c it was great for notification options but too much hassle for me currently
2010-04-05T15:26:00.000Z	Jester05		this is just a temporary home theater media server configuration to begin with lol
2010-04-05T15:26:00.000Z	Jester05		ohh really thanks moetunes
2010-04-05T15:26:00.000Z	Jester05		I may have to look into it
2010-04-05T15:28:00.000Z	Jester05		alright thanks moetunes def going to install it on my test box here in a few
2010-04-05T15:28:00.000Z	Jester05		I think I'm going to create a virtual install just for testing rather than using my main pc for testing lol
2010-04-05T15:29:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	Jester05	for rtorrent? no need imho, but as you wish
2010-04-05T15:29:00.000Z	Jester05	brontosaurusrex	haha no not for rtorrent, only.. lol  I've been doing a lot of testing lately
