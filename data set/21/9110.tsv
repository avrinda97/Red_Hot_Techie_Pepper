2005-12-03T08:06:00.000Z	frogzoo		your problem is that you can't fsck while the partition is mounted
2005-12-03T08:08:00.000Z	LjL	frogzoo	what about  shutdown -F -r ?
2005-12-03T08:09:00.000Z	frogzoo	LjL	problem is, he can't boot up in the first place
2005-12-03T08:09:00.000Z	LjL	frogzoo	markus__ : where does booting stop?
2005-12-03T08:10:00.000Z	frogzoo	LjL	I think it was as soon as the fsck of /
2005-12-03T08:11:00.000Z	frogzoo	LjL	he brought it on himself - just powered off from the sounds of things
2005-12-03T08:12:00.000Z	LjL	frogzoo	i "just power off" quite often, and never got something like that
2005-12-03T08:12:00.000Z	LjL	frogzoo	(yeah, i know "just powering off" isn't quite recommended)
2005-12-03T08:12:00.000Z	frogzoo	LjL	well one of these days...
2005-12-03T08:13:00.000Z	LjL	frogzoo	ext3 is journaled, it shouldn't get the filesystem in such a messy state even after a hard poweroff
2005-12-03T08:13:00.000Z	LjL	frogzoo	say "one of these years" anyway, 'cause i've been running Debian with ext3 on my server for about four years, and i often just turned the power off ;)
2005-12-03T08:14:00.000Z	LjL	frogzoo	anyway, i'm not really advocating hard power-offs, mind you, just saying they aren't supposed to mess your filesystem to such a bad state
2005-12-19T17:45:00.000Z	LjL	frogzoo	wine is fastest. qemu comes second, i guess. qemu can become quite fast with the optional "accelerator", but that's closed source (though free)
2006-06-14T11:13:00.000Z	frogzoo	LjL	sometimes just specing horizsync & vertrefresh is al lthat's necessary
2006-06-14T11:13:00.000Z	LjL	frogzoo	if you know them, yes. otherwise, specifying the highest display mode with the highest frequency that you know is supported can be just fine
2006-12-17T08:53:00.000Z	LjL	frogzoo	testsusf: wasn't following, but "shutdown -F -r now" will restart the computer *and* perform a filesystem check when it reboots, without touching files manually
2007-01-23T08:17:00.000Z	LjL	frogzoo	-. ---, they have fun with morse instead
2007-01-26T10:11:00.000Z	LjL	frogzoo	i believe that's text based. but for what you asked, why don't you just use iptables itself?
2007-01-26T10:12:00.000Z	frogzoo	LjL	that's exactly what I do want - but I need something to load the tables at startup
2007-01-26T10:12:00.000Z	LjL	frogzoo	man iptables-restore and man iptables-save
2007-01-26T10:13:00.000Z	LjL	frogzoo	what's in the wiki is probably a better idea though (well, cleaner at any rate), see "Configuration on startup" paragraph
