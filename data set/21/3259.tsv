2009-02-13T10:14:00.000Z	spaceBARbarian		PLEASE HELP: i compiled a program using gcc, its compiled and LINKED, But when i try to do ./programname , i get a "permission denied", then i did "sudo -s ./programname", and i get "cannot execute binary file"
2009-02-13T10:15:00.000Z	RussM	spaceBARbarian	type "file ./programname" -- what does it say?
2009-02-13T10:17:00.000Z	spaceBARbarian	RussM	"./cse473-ipc: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), for GNU/Linux 2.6.8, dynamically linked (uses shared libs), not stripped "

2009-02-13T10:19:00.000Z	RussM	spaceBARbarian	Well, that certainly seems like it should run.
2009-02-13T10:20:00.000Z	spaceBARbarian	RussM	I know i have no idea wtf is going on :(
2009-02-13T10:21:00.000Z	RussM	spaceBARbarian	What does "ldd ./programname" give you?
2009-02-13T10:21:00.000Z	spaceBARbarian	RussM	could it have anything to do with me using VBOX ?
2009-02-13T10:21:00.000Z	RussM	spaceBARbarian	That I can't answer, since I haven't tried VBox yet.
2009-02-13T10:21:00.000Z	spaceBARbarian	RussM	"ldd: warning: you do not have execution permission for `./cse473-ipc'"
2009-02-13T10:22:00.000Z	RussM		So, what's "ls -l cse473-ipc" show/
2009-02-13T10:22:00.000Z	spaceBARbarian	RussM	"-rw-rw-rw- 1 root root 13584 2009-02-13 00:16 cse473-ipc"
2009-02-13T10:23:00.000Z	RussM	spaceBARbarian	Well, then just try "chmod +x cse473-ipc"
2009-02-13T10:23:00.000Z	RussM	spaceBARbarian	Thought I'm not sure why gcc would create it w/o the execute bit on it.
2009-02-13T10:24:00.000Z	spaceBARbarian	RussM	i did that, it doesnt change anything
2009-02-13T10:24:00.000Z	RussM	spaceBARbarian	Try this... copy it to /tmp, then chmod +x it there.
2009-02-13T10:25:00.000Z	RussM	spaceBARbarian	I'm going to take a guess that for some reason, you're on a filesystem mounted with a mask that precludes execute...
2009-02-13T10:26:00.000Z	spaceBARbarian	RussM	nice work lol, i totally forgot that i was working out of my Share folder in Vbox
2009-02-13T10:26:00.000Z	spaceBARbarian		haha what a dumb move
2009-02-13T10:26:00.000Z	spaceBARbarian		thanks for the help
2009-02-13T10:26:00.000Z	RussM	spaceBARbarian	np
