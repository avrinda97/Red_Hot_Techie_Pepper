2005-02-01T14:02:00.000Z	swim		hrmm can anyone think of a reason why totem is not showing video ? only sound?
2005-02-01T14:03:00.000Z	K-Rich	swim	try totem-xine
2005-02-01T14:03:00.000Z	swim	K-Rich	hmm wasnt installed it seems
2005-02-01T14:04:00.000Z	swim	K-Rich	seems if I install totem-xine totem-gstreamer (which I dont think I care about) must be removed but then also ubuntu desktop!  ?
2005-02-01T14:05:00.000Z	swim		ubuntu-desktop that is
2005-02-01T14:06:00.000Z	K-Rich	swim	installing totem-zine will handle removing totem-gstreamer and ubuntu-desktop isn't a "real" package but i'm brain farting and can't think what kinda package it is, it's like smbolic or something
2005-02-01T14:06:00.000Z	K-Rich		totem-xine even
2005-02-01T14:06:00.000Z	swim	K-Rich	so it wont remove anything important? like ubuntu images or something? gdm or whatever?
2005-02-01T14:07:00.000Z	K-Rich		nope
2005-02-01T14:07:00.000Z	swim		ok then thx :)
2005-02-01T14:07:00.000Z	K-Rich		all will be fine
2005-02-01T14:08:00.000Z	swim	K-Rich	much better thank you !:)
2005-02-01T14:08:00.000Z	K-Rich		np
2005-02-01T14:08:00.000Z	swim	K-Rich	hehe though now its showing video and no sound! :P
2005-02-01T14:10:00.000Z	K-Rich		ugh not good... did an error box pop up by chance saying the sound is in use?
2005-02-01T14:10:00.000Z	swim	K-Rich	 nope, nothing
2005-02-01T14:10:00.000Z	K-Rich		odd... :/
2005-02-01T14:11:00.000Z	K-Rich		not sure now... worked fine for me :/
2005-02-01T14:13:00.000Z	swim		damn
2005-02-01T14:17:00.000Z	swim		that is so lame if I install totem-xine I get video and no sound, if I install totem-gstreamer I get sound and no video!
2005-02-01T14:21:00.000Z	swim	K-Rich	I wonder if there is a way to tell totem what audio to use visavi esd
