2012-08-29T16:56:00.000Z	BebopSteve		shame chrome is so awesome
2012-08-29T16:56:00.000Z	BebopSteve		I switched back to Fx though
2012-08-29T16:58:00.000Z	zeptis	BebopSteve	but DDG cares about your freedoms
2012-08-29T16:58:00.000Z	BebopSteve		Too much noise
2012-08-29T16:58:00.000Z	BebopSteve		trying to think of how to explain
2012-08-29T16:59:00.000Z	BebopSteve		yeah, too much on the page
2012-08-29T17:00:00.000Z	BebopSteve		also the logo is ...  call me shallow but it hurts my eyes
2012-08-29T17:01:00.000Z	zeptis		Bebop: just change in settings for look and feel

2012-08-29T17:02:00.000Z	zeptis		DDG cares about my privacy, Google sells my information, Yahoo and Bing are google but not useful.
2012-08-29T17:02:00.000Z	BebopSteve		and the topic kinda shifted because I said I was having a hard time finding the solution through google
