2011-09-05T23:44:00.000Z	urlin2u	w30	that is a personal opinion, not a support answer.
2011-09-05T23:47:00.000Z	w30	urlin2u	in my opinion it's a support answer
2011-09-05T23:48:00.000Z	urlin2u	w30	really, your that stupid
2011-09-05T23:51:00.000Z	w30	urlin2u	and in my opinion Windows 7, XP, and Vista should be uninstalled on any computer and installed with Ubuntu
2011-09-05T23:52:00.000Z	urlin2u	w30	excellent in your opinion. :D This is a support channel though.
2011-09-05T23:55:00.000Z	w30	urlin2u	I support and advocate getting Ubuntu installed and Windows removed on all computers but realize it's not possible; some people need Windows
2011-09-05T23:57:00.000Z	urlin2u	w30	excellent, you know a OS is a OS, answering that any is better then the other overall is not responsible, and this is OT.
2011-09-17T03:26:00.000Z	urlin2u	w30	no.
2011-09-17T03:27:00.000Z	urlin2u	w30	you can sg=hrink it though with the unity plugin in compiz configuration manager

2011-12-23T03:13:00.000Z	urlin2u	w30	synaptic doesn't update grub when you remove a kernel I believe
2011-12-23T03:14:00.000Z	w30	urlin2u	mine does if I use Synaptic unless thinks have changed in the last couple of months
