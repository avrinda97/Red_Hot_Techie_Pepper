2006-11-02T08:12:00.000Z	Poseidon		is ubuntu available on laptop?
2006-11-02T08:13:00.000Z	abovett	Poseidon	It'kll run on them - or do you want one with it preinstalled?
2006-11-02T08:14:00.000Z	abovett	Poseidon	I think a few people are selling them but not sure who.
2006-11-02T08:15:00.000Z	abovett	Poseidon	works well on most laptops I've tried though.
2006-11-02T08:15:00.000Z	abovett	Poseidon	what is it?
2006-11-02T08:16:00.000Z	Poseidon	abovett	,v5.04
2006-11-02T08:16:00.000Z	abovett	Poseidon	It will but why not get a more up to date version - it'll work better.
2006-11-02T08:18:00.000Z	abovett	Poseidon	Either download edgy or dapper, or get CDs via ShipIt
2006-11-02T08:20:00.000Z	abovett	Poseidon	What is Haredisk?
2006-11-02T08:22:00.000Z	abovett	Poseidon	do you mean you want to install from an image on the hard disk, or install _to_ the hard disk?
2006-11-02T08:24:00.000Z	abovett	Poseidon	Can't you burn the ISO to a CD?
2006-11-02T08:25:00.000Z	abovett	Poseidon	Yes. What OS are you running at the moment?
2006-11-02T08:26:00.000Z	abovett	Poseidon	You need to burn the ISO to CD as a disk image - can't remember if XP can do that itself or if you need to use something like Nero. _Don't_ just burn the ISO file to the CD as a file!
2006-11-02T08:27:00.000Z	abovett	Poseidon	Do you have Nero or anything like that?
2006-11-02T08:28:00.000Z	abovett	Poseidon	VM? You mean you are running a virtual machine?
2006-11-02T08:28:00.000Z	Poseidon	abovett	no I dont want to run it  ,it is too slow
2006-11-02T08:30:00.000Z	abovett	Poseidon	So do you have any way to burn the ISO to CD as an image? If you like I can check if XP can do it itself but it will take a few minutes - no XP boxes ruinning at the moment.
2006-11-02T08:33:00.000Z	abovett	Poseidon	No - don't just copy the ISO to CD - that won't work.
2006-11-02T08:34:00.000Z	abovett	Poseidon	you must burn it as a disk image. Nero can definitely do it - I'll cyheck if XP can do it without nero - hold on...
2006-11-02T08:39:00.000Z	abovett	Poseidon	XP can't burn ISO images by itself, but I think there are some free programs which will do it if you don't have Nero or anything like that. Can't vouch for them though. It _might_ be possible to install from an ISO image on the hard disk but I'm not exactly sure how and I suspect it would be a little complex.
2006-11-02T08:42:00.000Z	abovett	Poseidon	OK - good luck.
