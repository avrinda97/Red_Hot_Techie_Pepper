2011-05-02T23:30:00.000Z	andeeeuk_		has anyone else got gimp in single window mode
2011-05-02T23:31:00.000Z	Halzen	andeeeuk_	In the new GIMP 2.8, single window mode is activated via a checkbox in the Windows menu.
2011-05-02T23:32:00.000Z	andeeeuk_	Halzen	yeah I had that before, did you get it from that repo?
2011-05-02T23:34:00.000Z	Halzen	andeeeuk_	I no longer use GIMP, but when I did, I used this repo: http://ppa.launchpad.net/matthaeus123/mrw-gimp-svn/ubuntu maverick main deb
2011-05-02T23:34:00.000Z	Halzen	andeeeuk_	Use this authentication key line: sudo apt-key adv - recv-keys - keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com 405A15CB
2011-05-02T23:34:00.000Z	andeeeuk_	Halzen	yeah that is what i use
2011-05-02T23:35:00.000Z	andeeeuk_	Halzen	i have that all done, what do you use?
2011-05-02T23:35:00.000Z	Halzen	andeeeuk_	If that is updated, you should have a single-window option.
2011-05-02T23:35:00.000Z	andeeeuk_	Halzen	i think i need to update my repos first and then it will upgrade
2011-05-02T23:36:00.000Z	andeeeuk_	Halzen	do you use photoshot now then?
2011-05-02T23:36:00.000Z	Halzen	andeeeuk_	Yes, I have Photoshop CS5 running smoothly under Wine.
2011-05-02T23:36:00.000Z	andeeeuk_	Halzen	nice one!!
2011-05-02T23:36:00.000Z	andeeeuk_	Halzen	do you have any problems with it at all?
2011-05-02T23:37:00.000Z	Halzen	andeeeuk_	For a while, I had a couple of glitches, but my own tweaks and a new kernel have it running silk.
2011-05-02T23:38:00.000Z	andeeeuk_	Halzen	good stuff, I had cs4 running without any problems
2011-05-02T23:38:00.000Z	andeeeuk_	Halzen	was really good
2011-05-02T23:38:00.000Z	Halzen	andeeeuk_	If you're willing to pay up for it, CS5 is a great upgrade over CS4. I actually upgraded from good old 7.0 xD
2011-05-02T23:39:00.000Z	andeeeuk_	Halzen	I would do but it does dost a lot
2011-05-02T23:39:00.000Z	Halzen	andeeeuk_	Yes, it's definitely costly. I'm a professional graphic designer, and GIMP just wasn't cutting it for me. However, I do use Inkscape in place of Illustrator. I think GIMP is coming along just fine, too.
2011-05-02T23:41:00.000Z	andeeeuk_	Halzen	yeah for a pro i can see why, I have been uding gimp for a while now as well and have found it a great tool. Really bad without single window mode though
