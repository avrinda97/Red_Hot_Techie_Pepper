2009-08-02T04:59:00.000Z	mc1		well, to me it's not "die or live" thing.  i just wanted to try it out!
2009-08-02T04:59:00.000Z	mc1		I can boot and leave the computer on indefinitely
2009-08-02T04:59:00.000Z	mc1		that's the file system i'm using
2009-08-02T04:59:00.000Z	mc1		tried ext3, ext4 and Reiser4 too
2009-08-02T05:00:00.000Z	mc1		well it's a lap and often i leave it on so my im contacts can see me
2009-08-02T05:02:00.000Z	mc1		yeah, i can see you're very technical.  the way i see it, hardware goes obsolete soon
2009-08-02T05:02:00.000Z	mc1		so i try to get my money's worth
2009-08-02T05:03:00.000Z	mc1		jajaj... ok.  No brag but, i change two laps every year.  so i don't worry about that
2009-08-02T05:03:00.000Z	kunji	mc1	what hardware are you using?  I'm too much of a noob myself to actually help out, just curious though.
2009-08-02T05:03:00.000Z	mc1		intel dual proc
2009-08-02T05:03:00.000Z	mc1		'round 2 Gigs
2009-08-02T05:04:00.000Z	mc1		3 Gigs RAM
2009-08-02T05:04:00.000Z	mc1		340 hd
2009-08-02T05:04:00.000Z	kunji	mc1	I missed the beginning of your conversation, what is the trouble you're having?
2009-08-02T05:05:00.000Z	mc1		well kunji:  i was doing an update using Synaptic and all of a sudden i
2009-08-02T05:05:00.000Z	mc1	kunji	here is my paste: http://paste.ubuntu.com/242774/
2009-08-02T05:06:00.000Z	mc1		other'n that.  the os is fine
2009-08-02T05:07:00.000Z	kunji	mc1	 yeah, I don't know anything about that, something that might be an alternative would be to run the OS off of a flashdrive.
2009-08-02T05:08:00.000Z	mc1	kunji	 I've tried that as well successfully
2009-08-02T05:09:00.000Z	mc1		but i don't like carrying around an usb stick.  tried off a micro sd card but it didnt work
2009-08-02T05:09:00.000Z	kunji	mc1	oh well..
