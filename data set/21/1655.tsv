2010-06-29T09:59:00.000Z	codebrainz	joshmuffin	have you tried the gnome channel?
2010-06-29T10:00:00.000Z	joshmuffin	codebrainz	no one has replied all day
2010-06-29T10:01:00.000Z	codebrainz	joshmuffin	yeah, it's slow over there, they are very helpful when they're around.  there's some junk on google
