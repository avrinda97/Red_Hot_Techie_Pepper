2010-08-11T07:11:00.000Z	annie		Ubuntu is not a laughing matter
2010-08-11T07:13:00.000Z	annie		My bad... I had the tack on the wrong side... -p vs p-
2010-08-11T07:14:00.000Z	sacarlson	annie	when I do your command all i get is ssh: Could not resolve hostname host: Name or service not known
2010-08-11T07:15:00.000Z	annie	sacarlson	I had the tack on the wrong side... -p vs p- .So the tunnel is now active, but Firefox won't use the proxy
2010-08-11T07:21:00.000Z	sacarlson	annie	I guess vpn wouldn't be an alternate option?
2010-08-11T07:23:00.000Z	annie	sacarlson	if it's easy enough to set up.... I just what to run a web proxy. VPN is more for accessing files?
2010-08-11T07:25:00.000Z	sacarlson	annie	no you can use vpn to run a browser secure also.  not sure what your atempting to do
2010-08-11T07:26:00.000Z	sacarlson	annie	with vpn setup in some ways all trafic that should go to the internet goes through your vpn from that vpn server it goes to the internet.  no setup needed on each network aplication.
2010-08-11T07:29:00.000Z	annie	sacarlson	kk... just to clarify what I'm attempting to do. My friend is overseas, I want her to browse the web securely as possible. If a vpn can do this, that'll be great.
2010-08-11T07:29:00.000Z	sacarlson	annie	 well then yes that's what vpn is for
2010-08-11T07:30:00.000Z	annie	sacarlson	cool beans. I'll read up on that then... Thanks
2010-08-11T07:30:00.000Z	sacarlson	annie	I live over seas and that's what i use it for
2010-08-11T07:30:00.000Z	sacarlson	annie	look at openvpn
2010-08-11T07:31:00.000Z	annie	sacarlson	kk. Heading there now.
2010-08-11T07:45:00.000Z	annie	sacarlson	hate to whine... openvpn is really not making much sense to me. I've remotely installed the bridge and I'm trying to edit the interfaces file. More indepth than I can handle on my own I'm sure. Is there a way to troubleshoot the ssh/proxy problem?
2010-08-11T07:47:00.000Z	sacarlson	annie	vpn is what your doing with your ssh project it's the same thing even uses the same method of encryption
2010-08-11T07:50:00.000Z	sacarlson	annie	this sounds like what you want http://blog.davidkaspar.com/archives/2007/02/howto-free-secure-web-browsing-and-access-to-home-network-using-openvpn.php
2010-08-11T07:57:00.000Z	annie	sacarlson	sounds like what I need, but he's talking about windows and using a gui. And I get lost after he mentions 'bridging'. I'm looking over other tutorials now.
2010-08-11T07:58:00.000Z	sacarlson	annie	i didn't look that close at it i'll see if i find one that only use linux
2010-08-11T08:21:00.000Z	annie	sacarlson	I'm to the point where I'm making keys... I notice that there is geographical info in the file... is this important for it to reflect her location overseas?
2010-08-11T08:32:00.000Z	annie	sacarlson	cool... ty
