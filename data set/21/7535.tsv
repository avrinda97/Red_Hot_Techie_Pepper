2006-09-08T16:47:00.000Z	jamesuk		Can someone help me with a small networking problem accessing the web?
2006-09-08T16:49:00.000Z	jamesuk		[PROBLEM]  I've just installed Ubunto 6.06 on my laptop. I am connected to my wired LAN. I have it configured by DHCP but I cannot access the internet. I can ping websites and get a reply, but when I traceroute the same website it gets to about step 8 and then gives no reply. Any Ideas?
2006-09-08T16:51:00.000Z	nich0s	jamesuk	Have you tried assigning it a static IP at your router and in the network settings of your adapter/
2006-09-08T16:53:00.000Z	jamesuk	nich0s	I tried that but it wouldn't even resolve a domain name then for some strange reason.
2006-09-08T16:54:00.000Z	nich0s	jamesuk	Are other computers on your network exhibiting the same symptoms?
2006-09-08T16:55:00.000Z	jamesuk	nich0s	No I have XP Pro on the laptop too and thats fine - I am on my main tower here and thats fine too. I had SUSE on the laptop before and there were no problems there.
2006-09-08T16:55:00.000Z	nich0s	jamesuk	A simple no would have been cool :P What about the 'nslookup google.com'?
2006-09-08T16:56:00.000Z	jamesuk	nich0s	:)
2006-09-08T16:58:00.000Z	nich0s	jamesuk	There aren't any proxies hardcoded in to firefox, are there?
2006-09-08T16:59:00.000Z	jamesuk	nich0s	I haven't configured any proxies in it
2006-09-08T16:59:00.000Z	jamesuk	nich0s	Just checked - says Direct Connection to the Internet
2006-09-08T05:00:00.000Z	nich0s	jamesuk	I guess I shouldn't be trying to help people after being up for 48 hours :P
2006-09-08T05:00:00.000Z	jamesuk	nich0s	48 hours! How are you still awake! Get some sleep! :p
2006-09-08T05:02:00.000Z	nich0s	jamesuk	Should be like 64.233.meh.something
2006-09-08T05:05:00.000Z	nich0s	jamesuk	type sudo in front of it.
2006-09-08T05:38:00.000Z	nich0s	jamesuk	Do you live near a major military installation?
2006-09-08T05:39:00.000Z	jamesuk	nich0s	No I don't think so
2006-09-08T05:39:00.000Z	nich0s	jamesuk	well then just damn it all to hell :P
2006-09-08T05:40:00.000Z	nich0s	jamesuk	Good luck
2006-09-08T05:41:00.000Z	nich0s	jamesuk	Don't accidently create a win part this time.
