2011-04-17T05:58:00.000Z	RealOp		So im attempting to upgrade from 10.10 32 bit, to 10.10 64 bit. If i select use entire partition does it erase my data?
2011-04-17T05:59:00.000Z	tiox	RealOp	Maybe not?
2011-04-17T05:59:00.000Z	tiox		Hey, is there a way he can do a dist-upgrade to a 64-bit version of buntu?
2011-04-17T06:01:00.000Z	tiox	RealOp	I heard if you reinstall Ubuntu and keep your primary account information the same, your home folder will not be erased at all, and you can still continue where you left off with a few simple commands.
2011-04-17T06:01:00.000Z	tiox		Can anyone here confirm what I said was right?
2011-04-17T06:02:00.000Z	tiox		So to do this, he would have to make a /home partition and move everything to it, provided he went with a default install?
2011-04-17T06:02:00.000Z	RealOp	tiox	any more info?
2011-04-17T06:02:00.000Z	tiox	RealOp	You went with a typical, automated install right?
2011-04-17T06:03:00.000Z	tiox		Well, guess what? If he went with a typical install, gparted would show no home.
2011-04-17T06:03:00.000Z	tiox		It would just be /.
2011-04-17T06:03:00.000Z	tiox		Oh, and some swap, I think.
2011-04-17T06:03:00.000Z	RealOp		lol i was on psyhcocats last night
2011-04-17T06:03:00.000Z	tiox		Hah.
2011-04-17T06:04:00.000Z	tiox		Well, follow their instructions. THEN you can reinstall Ubuntu with 64-bit without worrying about overwriting home.
2011-04-17T06:04:00.000Z	tiox		Otherwise, the other way to do it would be to copy home to an external deice, reinstall, then replace the contents in your new home from stufff in your old home.
2011-04-17T06:05:00.000Z	tiox		Think of it like taking your prized possessions before bulldozing a house, then putting everything in the new house.
2011-04-17T06:05:00.000Z	RealOp		okay ive decided what im gonna do
2011-04-17T06:06:00.000Z	RealOp		just repartition it so my new OS is at the begining of the partition, move all my 'old data' to another partition been wanting to do this for awhile anyways
2011-04-17T06:07:00.000Z	tiox	RealOp	Parted magic is a nice solution for this.
2011-04-17T06:07:00.000Z	tiox		Look it up, burn it to disk, use it. It comes with gparted, uses LXDE so it;s lightweight and less prone to crashing in the middle of changing things.
2011-04-17T06:08:00.000Z	RealOp	tiox	just gonna use gpartd thats on the installer cd
