2006-05-13T07:47:00.000Z	daharon		hey guys.  I'm new to ubuntu.  What is the utility that allows you to easily manipulate init files?
2006-05-13T07:47:00.000Z	daharon		like which ones to load at bootup and what runlevel they occur at
2006-05-13T07:48:00.000Z	voraistos	daharon	what do u mean? what do u want ?
2006-05-13T07:49:00.000Z	daharon	voraistos	an init script manager, like rc-update from Gentoo
2006-05-13T07:49:00.000Z	voraistos	daharon	what does it do? i dunno gentoo :(
2006-05-13T07:50:00.000Z	voraistos	daharon	i think we dont have that on ubuntu: just multiple specific tools
2006-05-13T07:50:00.000Z	voraistos	daharon	usually it is gedit ;)
2006-05-13T07:51:00.000Z	daharon	voraistos	I dont want to edit the scripts, just control which ones are going to come up at boot and in what sequence
2006-05-13T07:52:00.000Z	daharon	voraistos	for instance, I want to stop lm-sensors from coming up at boot
2006-05-13T07:52:00.000Z	voraistos	daharon	yeah. but we just dont do that on ubuntu. Well, i dont.
2006-05-13T07:53:00.000Z	daharon	voraistos	so what do you do when you are messing around with stuff?  reboot after every change?
2006-05-13T07:53:00.000Z	daharon	voraistos	nm, that didn't make sense
2006-05-13T07:54:00.000Z	daharon	voraistos	but anyway, I need the POWER!
2006-05-13T07:55:00.000Z	voraistos	daharon	i dont know what is gentoo, buty what is sure is that you wont mess up with a debian system easily.
2006-05-13T07:55:00.000Z	daharon	voraistos	why do you say that?  I'm pretty sure I could screw it up good if I try
2006-05-13T07:56:00.000Z	voraistos	daharon	yeah! lol. what i mean is that u can screw it on purpose. fedora screws itself, just like windows for example.
2006-05-13T07:57:00.000Z	daharon	voraistos	so it does a good job of taking care of itself?  thats good.  I'm on a laptop and I don't want to fuss with it really.  Keep gentoo on the desktop
2006-05-13T07:57:00.000Z	voraistos	daharon	ubuntu is easy to manage. just dont use Automatix, unless you wanna screw your system
2006-05-13T07:57:00.000Z	daharon	voraistos	too late
2006-05-13T07:58:00.000Z	daharon	voraistos	automatix seemed to work alright for me though
2006-05-13T08:00:00.000Z	daharon	voraistos	I haven't used anything but Gentoo for about 3 years.  The usual normal way is editing all my own configuration files
