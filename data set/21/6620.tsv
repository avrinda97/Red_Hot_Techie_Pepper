2007-05-22T07:46:00.000Z	raxor	crdlb	sorry, I was trying to read what you were saying earlier but lost the backscroll what is the "DISABLED OPTIONS thing"
2007-05-22T07:47:00.000Z	crdlb	raxor	if the wrong nvidia kernel modules is being loaded, it's a way to force the right one to be
2007-05-22T07:47:00.000Z	raxor	crdlb	what is the command?
2007-05-22T07:48:00.000Z	crdlb	raxor	in /etc/default/linux-restricted-modules-common, set DISABLED_MODULES="nvidia_legacy nvidia_new"
2007-05-22T07:48:00.000Z	raxor	crdlb	as near as I can tell that is my error... I tried to overwrite it with the drivers from nvidias site but it is still not working correctly...
2007-05-22T07:48:00.000Z	crdlb	raxor	or use nvidia instead of nvidia_new
2007-05-22T07:49:00.000Z	crdlb	raxor	if you're using the 9755 driver
2007-05-22T07:53:00.000Z	raxor	crdlb	should I assume the install went bad and try again... or is this kind of thing pretty common?
2007-05-22T07:54:00.000Z	crdlb	raxor	if you're going to use the nvidia installer, you need DISABLED_MODULES="nv"
2007-05-22T07:59:00.000Z	raxor	crdlb	okay I got a little lost, but I got x to start.... I used the driver "nv" in my xorg.conf after doing a sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-new and setting DISABLED_MODULES to "nvidia_legacy nv"-- I am sure I have done something wrong but it is working ;)
2007-05-22T08:00:00.000Z	crdlb	raxor	I think you're using a mix of the nvidia installer and the ubuntu packages though
2007-05-22T08:00:00.000Z	raxor	crdlb	that seems bad.. right/
2007-05-22T08:00:00.000Z	crdlb	raxor	so it may break when the next kernel upgrade happens
2007-05-22T08:01:00.000Z	crdlb	raxor	no it's not that big of a deal though since they're the same version
2007-05-22T08:01:00.000Z	raxor	crdlb	well I just installed, would you recommend reinstalling and starting again with my sanity hat on?
2007-05-22T08:02:00.000Z	crdlb	raxor	only if you want to :)
2007-05-22T08:03:00.000Z	raxor	crdlb	well I think I may... it seems like a good time for it... and now I think I can go from scratch without a bunch of weird stuff... that was always the problem with my dapper install :)
2007-05-22T08:58:00.000Z	raxor	crdlb	still around?
2007-05-22T08:58:00.000Z	crdlb	raxor	yep
2007-05-22T08:58:00.000Z	raxor	crdlb	I reinstalled and eveything worked out of the box...
2007-05-22T08:59:00.000Z	raxor	crdlb	the only thing I did differently was I didn't enable the restricted mode drivers during nstall the second time... I think that causes things to not work...
