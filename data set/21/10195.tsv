2009-02-17T08:30:00.000Z	nickrud	whacked	did you read and make sure you knew what those 'few commands' did?
2009-02-17T08:32:00.000Z	nickrud	whacked	why not go afk for a bit, cool down, and come back when you're ready to explain what you did?
2009-02-17T08:33:00.000Z	nickrud	whacked	ok, that's good. It installed grub on .... well, I can but if you're gonna act a twit I'll help someone else. See ya.
2009-02-17T08:33:00.000Z	nickrud	whacked	come back in a couple hours when you've cooled down.
2009-02-17T08:37:00.000Z	nickrud	whacked	that's ok, now you just need to add windows to the grub boot.
2009-02-17T08:37:00.000Z	nickrud	whacked	do you want to have windows boot automatically, or be able to choose between windows and ubuntu at boot?
2009-02-17T08:39:00.000Z	nickrud	whacked	he said to boot the windows cd for those commands. Read back, answer my question about booting
2009-02-17T08:40:00.000Z	nickrud	whacked	then redvamp128 's advice will do it quickly
2009-02-20T22:25:00.000Z	nickrud	whacked	hm, the page doesn't include 8.10 in the short form. fixing. Thanks
2009-02-21T00:10:00.000Z	nickrud	whacked	you can't expect your hard earned experience on windows to transfer transparently to unix/linux. There's a fresh learning curve.
2009-02-21T00:12:00.000Z	nickrud	whacked	the point is stop complaining, and ask useful questions that will move you along in your install and learning curve
