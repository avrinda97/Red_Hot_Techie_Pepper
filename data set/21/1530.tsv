2011-07-11T19:30:00.000Z	blinkyb		Hi. My system started to get extremely slow especially with browsing. Is there any way I could fix that? Last week the pc was alright..
2011-07-11T19:31:00.000Z	rumpe1	blinkyb	how much ram? how much free space on / and /home?
2011-07-11T19:31:00.000Z	blinkyb	rumpe1	I don't know really. I am running Conky and the graph is full!
2011-07-11T19:32:00.000Z	rumpe1	blinkyb	free ram: "free -m" (row buffers/cache, column free), harddisk: "df -h"
2011-07-11T19:33:00.000Z	blinkyb	rumpe1	am i going to lose any data?
2011-07-11T19:34:00.000Z	rumpe1	blinkyb	no
2011-07-11T19:36:00.000Z	blinkyb	rumpe1	typing 'free -m' & 'df -h' only lists some figures
2011-07-11T19:36:00.000Z	blinkyb	rumpe1	total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
2011-07-11T19:37:00.000Z	rumpe1	blinkyb	use a pastebin or write the relevant entries
2011-07-11T19:37:00.000Z	blinkyb	rumpe1	http://pastebin.com/y3XVY70e
2011-07-11T19:40:00.000Z	blinkyb	rumpe1	what's next?
2011-07-11T19:40:00.000Z	rumpe1	blinkyb	pastebin.com doesn't seem to work here (blocked)
2011-07-11T19:41:00.000Z	blinkyb	rumpe1	http://paste.ubuntu.com/641983/
2011-07-11T19:47:00.000Z	rumpe1	blinkyb	well... ram and hd space doesn't seem to be the problem... as long as you don't open a few ram intensive applications like libreoffice, gimp oder browsers at the same time
2011-07-11T19:47:00.000Z	blinkyb	rumpe1	I'm just running firefox alone..
2011-07-11T19:47:00.000Z	blinkyb	rumpe1	Well, along with X-Chat here..
2011-07-11T19:48:00.000Z	rumpe1	blinkyb	maybe check with "top", which daemons/programs are using you resources
2011-07-11T19:55:00.000Z	blinkyb	rumpe1	there is something called plugin'containe'
2011-07-11T19:56:00.000Z	blinkyb	rumpe1	there is something called 'plugin-containe'. As soon as I ran 'top', containe was running %93! now it's around 8.
2011-07-11T19:57:00.000Z	rumpe1	blinkyb	perhaps you have activated some fancy desktop-window-stuff, which need some time and cpu
2011-07-11T19:57:00.000Z	blinkyb	rumpe1	I will remove this plugin and restart pc.
