2010-12-16T23:50:00.000Z	nirazio		When I run update from the terminal, I get the following list where many repositories are shown with "Ign". Does it mean the update manager will always ignore updates from those repositories?

2010-12-16T23:52:00.000Z	nirazio	ActionParsnip	But what does that mean???
2010-12-16T23:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nirazio	you upgrade from a server out in the great wide internet. There is more than one server to upgrade from so if you try a different one it may work, the one you are using currently may be down for maintenance
