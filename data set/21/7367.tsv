2008-07-06T03:27:00.000Z	ikonia	Fryguy--	some things yes/others no
2008-07-07T13:06:00.000Z	ikonia	Fryguy--	from what I'm reading it's using fakeraid which will cause him issues (looking at the spec
2008-07-07T13:07:00.000Z	Fryguy--	ikonia	a livecd is going to cause him far less problems than wubi
2008-07-07T13:07:00.000Z	ikonia	Fryguy--	ooh I agree, either way I think he's in for a very frsutrating time with not only fake raid, but fake raid 0
2008-07-07T13:08:00.000Z	ikonia	Fryguy--	fake raid = poor, raid 0 = pointless on home user kit

2008-07-08T01:46:00.000Z	ikonia	Fryguy--	he won't be able to use ntfs-3g due to him still running the dapper kernel
2008-07-08T01:46:00.000Z	Fryguy--	ikonia	k? why are you telling me
2008-07-08T01:46:00.000Z	ikonia	Fryguy--	I thought you where discussing it with CostaRicanQuaker
2008-07-08T01:46:00.000Z	Fryguy--	ikonia	no
