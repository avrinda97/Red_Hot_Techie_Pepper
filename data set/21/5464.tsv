2008-08-13T17:32:00.000Z	compubomb		i'm having some problems initializing a private key, i keep getting "Could not open a connection to your authentication agent."
2008-08-13T17:33:00.000Z	compubomb		problem is, i'm connected to ubuntu linux via putty.
2008-08-13T17:33:00.000Z	compubomb		when i type in ssh-agent, it lists all the socket information etc, i made sure the socket is created and it is, but i cannot type xterm since i'm not in a linux enviornment.
2008-08-13T17:35:00.000Z	geirha	compubomb	You need to add those variables ssh-agent outputs to your environment. You can do this by copy/pasting them, or running it through eval "eval $(ssh-agent)"
2008-08-13T17:35:00.000Z	compubomb	geirha	i'll show you what it does.
2008-08-13T17:35:00.000Z	compubomb		let me paste on pastebin

2008-08-13T17:37:00.000Z	compubomb	geirha	i've read that typing in xterm can resolve the problem, but i'm on windows using putty.
2008-08-13T17:37:00.000Z	geirha	compubomb	try "eval $(ssh-agent)"
2008-08-13T17:38:00.000Z	geirha	compubomb	You are expected to run the output from ssh-agent as shell-commands.
2008-08-13T17:38:00.000Z	compubomb	geirha	that seemed to work
2008-08-13T17:38:00.000Z	compubomb		why  did that work ?
2008-08-13T17:38:00.000Z	compubomb	geirha	just curious, why did that work ?
2008-08-13T17:38:00.000Z	geirha	compubomb	ssh-add uses the environment variables SSH_AUTH_SOCK and SSH_AGENT_PID to figure out which ssh-agent to use. So those needs to be set.
2008-08-13T17:39:00.000Z	compubomb	geirha	how can i make sure i don't have to run that all the time ?
2008-08-13T17:39:00.000Z	compubomb		do i just add it to my .bashrc file ?
2008-08-13T17:39:00.000Z	compubomb	geirha	echo "eval $(ssh-agent)" >> .bashrc ?
2008-08-13T17:40:00.000Z	geirha	compubomb	that will create a new ssh-agent everytime bash is run, so that's not such a good idea ... I'm not sure what the best way is :/
2008-08-13T17:41:00.000Z	geirha	compubomb	his google-hit explains some ways to do it http://mah.everybody.org/docs/ssh
2008-08-13T17:49:00.000Z	compubomb	geirha	btw, thanks
2008-08-13T17:50:00.000Z	geirha	compubomb	No problem.
