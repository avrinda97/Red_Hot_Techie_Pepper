2009-04-03T14:04:00.000Z	g33k_gir1		i can't get my windows share to be writeable... any ideas?
2009-04-03T14:04:00.000Z	g33k_gir1		!windows share
2009-04-03T14:04:00.000Z	g33k_gir1		!samba
2009-04-03T14:04:00.000Z	ziroday	g33k_gir1	how did you share it?
2009-04-03T14:05:00.000Z	g33k_gir1	ziroday	erm -- I edited the samba conf file
2009-04-03T14:05:00.000Z	ziroday	g33k_gir1	can you pastebin that please?
2009-04-03T14:06:00.000Z	g33k_gir1	ziroday	http://paste.ubuntu.com/143362/
2009-04-03T14:07:00.000Z	ziroday	g33k_gir1	try writeable = yes
2009-04-03T14:09:00.000Z	g33k_gir1	ziroday	I did it just like this, which works perfectly (although its a different drive): http://paste.ubuntu.com/143366/
2009-04-03T14:10:00.000Z	ziroday	g33k_gir1	heh, this is why I hate samba. NFS is soo much easier
2009-04-03T14:11:00.000Z	g33k_gir1	ziroday	lol, well, I'm willing to do it any way. its the office server, running ubuntu server...
2009-04-03T14:11:00.000Z	ziroday	g33k_gir1	sharing to just unix computers? Or are windows computers involved too?
2009-04-03T14:13:00.000Z	g33k_gir1	ziroday	unix, serving our internet, sharing to 1 ubuntu machine and 5 windoze
2009-04-03T14:13:00.000Z	ziroday	g33k_gir1	wait, samba over the internet?
2009-04-03T14:14:00.000Z	g33k_gir1	ziroday	no, samba over the internal network
2009-04-03T14:14:00.000Z	ziroday	g33k_gir1	right, well I have no idea why the first share works and the second doesn't. Sorry.
2009-04-03T14:15:00.000Z	g33k_gir1	ziroday	yes, neither did my "gentoo expert" I have on hand
2009-04-03T14:15:00.000Z	ziroday	g33k_gir1	sounds like a fun workplace
2009-04-03T14:17:00.000Z	g33k_gir1	ziroday	no. its not. its soul destroying. because i "know a bit about computers", I provide low level tech support. I think i might scream the next time someone asks me to show them, once again, how to burn a C
2009-04-03T14:17:00.000Z	g33k_gir1	ziroday	CD, that is
2009-04-03T14:17:00.000Z	ziroday	g33k_gir1	heh, probably #ubuntu-offtopic is the best place to whine about it :)
