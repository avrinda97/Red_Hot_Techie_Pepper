2007-05-29T08:32:00.000Z	gordboy	fotoflo	they are hw:0 and hw:1
2007-05-29T08:32:00.000Z	fotoflo		err and where do i select them?
2007-05-29T08:34:00.000Z	gordboy	fotoflo	in the sound apps. like preferneces -> sound system -> alsa -> device
2007-05-29T08:34:00.000Z	fotoflo	gordboy	what about firefox?
2007-05-29T08:36:00.000Z	gordboy	fotoflo	ok then. you are best choosing which soundcard you want, and disabling the other one. firefox uses hw:0 by default
2007-05-29T08:36:00.000Z	fotoflo		err i have them for different purposes
2007-05-29T08:37:00.000Z	gordboy	fotoflo	well you can make them load in the order you want. in /etc/modprobe.conf.
2007-05-29T08:38:00.000Z	fotoflo		ok
2007-05-29T08:38:00.000Z	fotoflo		thanks
