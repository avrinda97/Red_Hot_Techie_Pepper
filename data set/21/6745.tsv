2007-02-21T12:42:00.000Z	cables	atomiku	yep. Installing kubuntu-desktop or ubuntu-desktop does that automatically
2007-02-21T12:45:00.000Z	cables	atomiku	something will be posted to the ubuntu site. If you've used Automatix, you will probably have to install it from scratch.
2007-02-21T12:46:00.000Z	atomiku	cables	Oh... hmm...Automatix eh?
2007-02-21T12:46:00.000Z	cables	atomiku	Automatix is BAD.
2007-02-21T12:47:00.000Z	cables	atomiku	it's not to install ubuntu
2007-02-21T12:47:00.000Z	cables	atomiku	Automatix is software to install extra software. If you use it, it can kill the possibility of upgrading.
2007-02-21T12:49:00.000Z	cables	atomiku	no.
2007-02-21T12:50:00.000Z	cables	atomiku	there will be something posted on the ubuntu wiki that will explain how to upgrade easily.
2007-02-21T12:50:00.000Z	cables	atomiku	I recommend backing up first though, there were problems for a lot of people going to Edgy.
2007-02-21T12:50:00.000Z	cables	atomiku	just come here for questions then.
2007-02-21T12:51:00.000Z	atomiku	cables	I was just being curious
2007-03-11T11:07:00.000Z	cables	atomiku	are you on Edgy?
2007-03-11T11:07:00.000Z	cables	atomiku	if you're on Edgy you can do System>Administration>Software Sources instead.
2007-03-11T11:08:00.000Z	cables	atomiku	in that case you could do System>Administration>Software Sources instead of editing the file.
2007-03-11T11:09:00.000Z	cables	atomiku	I don't know how enabling backports will help
2007-03-11T11:13:00.000Z	cables	atomiku	were you trying to compile xchat, or just install from the repos?
2007-04-11T06:41:00.000Z	cables	atomiku	it appears before the @ in the prompt
2007-04-11T06:41:00.000Z	atomiku	cables	im on a wierd shell
2007-04-11T06:42:00.000Z	atomiku	cables	so...
2007-04-11T06:42:00.000Z	cables	atomiku	can't help you then :)
