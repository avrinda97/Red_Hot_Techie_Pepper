2006-12-22T14:51:00.000Z	exs		is ther *any* distribution (perhaps ubuntu based) that contains propeitary drivers for ati and nvidia?..
2006-12-22T14:52:00.000Z	un_operateur	exs	--- aptitude search "ati|nvidia|linux-restricted-modules"
2006-12-22T14:55:00.000Z	un_operateur	exs	not everything you own is going to be supported by linux (even windows for that matter) .. so you do need to install drivers apres-install
2006-12-22T14:57:00.000Z	un_operateur	exs	have you been here at all?? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
2006-12-22T14:58:00.000Z	un_operateur	exs	ATI and NVidia are restricted kernel drivers/modules -- ubuntu will probably never include them by default
2006-12-22T14:58:00.000Z	exs	un_operateur	 false, ubuntu is going to have those drivers in the next release, where have you been living for the past 5 years?
2006-12-22T14:59:00.000Z	un_operateur	exs	suit yourself dude -- you seem to know a lot more about ubuntu than i do and yet you can't get your drivers installed
2006-12-22T15:00:00.000Z	exs	un_operateur	 ill show you the wiki page
2006-12-22T15:00:00.000Z	un_operateur	exs	-- just read this page
2006-12-22T15:01:00.000Z	exs	un_operateur	 https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverEducation
2006-12-22T15:02:00.000Z	exs	un_operateur	 "As long as Ubuntu does ship proprietary drivers in the short term, we should take steps to improve the situation in the long term. We believe the best way to do this is to convey the problem to people using Ubuntu  explaining why we distribute non-Free drivers at all, what the risks are, and what people can do to avoid such hardware in future."
2006-12-22T15:04:00.000Z	un_operateur	exs	I guess ubuntu ought to start installing all restricted functionality too then -- because that goes against what they stand for -- it doesnt include mp3 support for the same reasons it doesnt include the restricted modules
2006-12-22T15:05:00.000Z	exs	un_operateur	 I don't make the rules, but I am not going to stand by and let you tell me what I'm saying is wrong, because it's already planned for, and you should of known it by now, it's been big news.
2006-12-22T15:06:00.000Z	un_operateur	exs	as i already said -- you either get the drivers working now manually or wait however long it takes -- just stop cribbing
2006-12-24T06:55:00.000Z	un_operateur	exs	does your card support direct rendering? check -- glxinfo  | grep -i rend
2006-12-24T06:56:00.000Z	exs	un_operateur	 well, I know i've had to do this before and it has worked
2006-12-24T06:56:00.000Z	exs	un_operateur	 I've just forgotten how to do it
2006-12-24T06:56:00.000Z	un_operateur	exs	well, i was just going to say -- if the graphics card does it i dont see why VLC has a problem
2006-12-24T06:57:00.000Z	exs	un_operateur	 because I haven't told it to use it yet, I don't know how (forgot)
2006-12-24T06:58:00.000Z	un_operateur	exs	I'm guessing VLC needs to be build with that capability -- http://www.videolan.org/doc/vlc-user-guide/en/ch02.html
2006-12-24T06:59:00.000Z	exs	un_operateur	 no it doesn't have to be built. Last time I asked about this it was a simple case of setting a prefrence
