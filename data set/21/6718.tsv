2007-02-27T06:00:00.000Z	spasticteapot		Hello!
2007-02-27T06:00:00.000Z	spasticteapot		Can anyone reccomend some games for Ubuntu?
2007-02-27T06:01:00.000Z	spasticteapot		Quite a few of hem won't work properly from the Debian repositories.
2007-02-27T06:01:00.000Z	orionrobots	spasticteapot	I really like tremulous
2007-02-27T06:03:00.000Z	orionrobots	spasticteapot	I have burned days away with Tremolous - but then I used to be a complete half-life addict at one point a few years back..
2007-02-27T06:04:00.000Z	orionrobots	spasticteapot	- I play tremulous on a trackball..
2007-02-27T06:04:00.000Z	spasticteapot	orionrobots	I have a thinkpad. I have a NIPPLEMAUS.
2007-02-27T06:05:00.000Z	orionrobots	spasticteapot	- ok they do suck..
2007-02-27T06:05:00.000Z	spasticteapot	orionrobots	They work great for word processing.
2007-02-27T06:05:00.000Z	orionrobots	spasticteapot	I once tried to play lincity with a touchpad - it really messed things up..
2007-02-27T06:06:00.000Z	orionrobots	spasticteapot	but once completed is pretty much over..
2007-02-27T06:06:00.000Z	spasticteapot	orionrobots	Tried it...after a few hours, I STILL could'nt build any facilities.
2007-02-27T06:12:00.000Z	orionrobots	spasticteapot	It is a shame that familiar does not yet support my pocketPC - parts of the chipset are nt yet supported - otherwise it would be using Linux too..
2007-02-27T06:12:00.000Z	spasticteapot	orionrobots	Feh! Linux runs on Gumstix!
2007-02-27T06:12:00.000Z	orionrobots	spasticteapot	I like the gumstix. BrickOS is linux like - runs on the RCX - that is hardcore... Lego + Linux..
2007-02-27T06:14:00.000Z	orionrobots	spasticteapot	I was given an Xgamestation today..
2007-02-27T06:14:00.000Z	orionrobots	spasticteapot	not sure what I will do with it.. yet.
2007-02-27T06:15:00.000Z	orionrobots	spasticteapot	http://www.xgamestation.com/ (it is a bit animation-tastic but gives you an idea)..
2007-02-27T06:16:00.000Z	orionrobots	spasticteapot	What I really want to get my hands on (when finance allows) is the Archos PMA400 (or is it the 450)...
2007-02-27T06:22:00.000Z	spasticteapot	orionrobots	Tried it...could'nt get into it.
2007-02-27T06:23:00.000Z	orionrobots	spasticteapot	It never did quite compare to real RPG'ing did it..
