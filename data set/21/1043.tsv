2011-03-05T08:02:00.000Z	sacarlson	Jasonn	I guess you can boot into single user to get back to root access and then modify your /etc/sudoer file from that
2011-03-05T08:03:00.000Z	Jasonn	sacarlson	how do i get root access on LiveCD?
2011-03-05T08:04:00.000Z	sacarlson	Jasonn	that's also an option you could use just enter a terminal in livecd sudo -s to become superuser
2011-03-05T09:24:00.000Z	sacarlson	Jasonn	did you manage to learn to open and edit the correct /etc/sudoer file?  if so do you know what is needed to be added to make it work for your user?
2011-03-05T09:26:00.000Z	sacarlson	Jasonn	so I assume the nope was for the first question.  did you manage to find a way to know what disk you normaly boot from and how to mount that partition?
2011-03-05T09:26:00.000Z	Jasonn	sacarlson	yeah, i got that, and i replaced the file with another one that i wrote up
2011-03-05T09:27:00.000Z	Jasonn	sacarlson	it didnt work though
2011-03-05T09:27:00.000Z	sacarlson	Jasonn	ok pastebin that file so we might get an idea what error you may have made
2011-03-05T09:28:00.000Z	Jasonn	sacarlson	It said that it had the wrong file ID or something
2011-03-05T09:28:00.000Z	sacarlson	Jasonn	at what point do you see this wrong file id failure?
2011-03-05T09:29:00.000Z	Jasonn	sacarlson	when i had already replaced the file, had to make a new one because it was read-only
2011-03-05T09:29:00.000Z	sacarlson	Jasonn	we should also take a look at your fdisk -l  to verify you are modifing the correct file on the correct partition
2011-03-05T09:30:00.000Z	Jasonn	sacarlson	yeah, i had because i saved a file on this HDD (partition) and then
2011-03-05T09:30:00.000Z	Jasonn	sacarlson	is su the same thing as sudo?
2011-03-05T09:30:00.000Z	sacarlson	Jasonn	oh IC you must have the security set correctly on the sudoer file or it will not work
2011-03-05T09:30:00.000Z	sacarlson	Jasonn	yes su is the same it uses the /etc/sudoer file also
2011-03-05T09:32:00.000Z	sacarlson	Jasonn	do you know how to set security  with chmod?  and chown?  you should modify the correct /etc/sudoer to the correct security level to operate
2011-03-05T20:50:00.000Z	sacarlson	Jasonn	other option is this http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/howto-ubuntu-linux-convert-dhcp-network-configuration-to-static-ip-configuration.html
2011-03-05T20:51:00.000Z	Jasonn	sacarlson	im running xubuntu, the network tab isnt there for me in the top bar
2011-03-05T20:52:00.000Z	sacarlson	Jasonn	that link has nothing to do with your tabs it requires modifing /etc/network/interfaces files and other
2011-03-05T20:53:00.000Z	Jasonn	sacarlson	thank you :)
