2005-04-07T10:58:00.000Z	black_nightmare		any of you mind telling me what GnomeMeeting is?
2005-04-07T10:58:00.000Z	airox	black_nightmare	like netmeeting for windows.
2005-04-07T10:59:00.000Z	airox	black_nightmare	yeah.
2005-04-07T11:00:00.000Z	airox	black_nightmare	It's client for RDP and VNC and some others ...
2005-04-07T11:00:00.000Z	airox	black_nightmare	Very usefull if you have windows xp or 2003 machines to manage.
2005-04-07T11:01:00.000Z	airox	black_nightmare	just telnet ? :)
2005-04-07T11:01:00.000Z	airox	black_nightmare	Or do you mean a telnet server ?
2005-04-07T11:01:00.000Z	airox	black_nightmare	Otherwise check out openssh.
2005-04-07T11:02:00.000Z	airox	black_nightmare	www.openssh.org (from the openbsd guys)
2005-04-07T11:02:00.000Z	airox	black_nightmare	apt-get install openssh-server (or openssh-client)
2005-04-07T11:03:00.000Z	airox	black_nightmare	then just use telnet
2005-04-07T11:04:00.000Z	airox	black_nightmare	I guess it's already there ...
2005-04-07T11:08:00.000Z	airox	black_nightmare	Just startup a terminal.
2005-04-07T11:08:00.000Z	airox	black_nightmare	Then try telnet. It will work.
2005-04-10T05:31:00.000Z	airox	black_nightmare	Yep.
2005-04-10T05:34:00.000Z	airox	black_nightmare	There is suspend to ram (then it will use power) and there is suspend to disk (then it will not use power, called hibernate mostly).
2005-04-10T05:36:00.000Z	airox	black_nightmare	When suspending the uptime also stays :)
2005-04-10T05:37:00.000Z	airox	black_nightmare	It's just nice to say that your linux machine didn't crashed for over 100 days ;)
2005-04-10T05:52:00.000Z	airox	black_nightmare	dpkg --get-selections | grep <whateveryouneed>
2005-04-10T05:55:00.000Z	airox	black_nightmare	Added multiverse and universe ?
2005-04-10T05:56:00.000Z	airox	black_nightmare	vim /etc/apt/sources.list
