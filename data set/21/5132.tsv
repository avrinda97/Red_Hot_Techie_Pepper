2007-12-17T11:37:00.000Z	AzureLight		Becasue I want a Windows Partition anyways
2007-12-17T11:38:00.000Z	AzureLight		Alright, does anyone have a link to a site that has all the instructions I'll need to dual boot XP and Ubuntu from absolutely nothing?
2007-12-17T11:39:00.000Z	AzureLight		Alright, now how do I go about wiping my HD with Windows?
2007-12-17T11:39:00.000Z	AzureLight		Does the Live CD have something to partition?
2007-12-17T11:39:00.000Z	AzureLight		I have a Gparted live cd
2007-12-17T11:40:00.000Z	AzureLight		Should I just format from my Gparted Live CD and then make my partitions from there?
2007-12-17T11:40:00.000Z	AzureLight		Better yet, is there a site with detailed instructions?
2007-12-17T11:41:00.000Z	AzureLight		Because I'm known to mess even the simplest things up
2007-12-17T11:41:00.000Z	AzureLight		Like the partition positions and whatnot
2007-12-17T11:41:00.000Z	AzureLight		Linux one first?
2007-12-17T11:41:00.000Z	sethk	AzureLight	you said you don't mind the risk of having to reinstall, so, sure, give that a try (gparted, that is)
2007-12-17T11:41:00.000Z	sethk	AzureLight	windows first
2007-12-17T11:42:00.000Z	sethk	AzureLight	yes, ext3
2007-12-17T11:52:00.000Z	sethk	AzureLight	I see no real advantage to a separate boot partition.
2007-12-17T11:52:00.000Z	sethk	AzureLight	I haven't used one in about 10 years.
2007-12-17T12:05:00.000Z	sethk	AzureLight	who knows?  You are obviously already in an IRC chat room.
2007-12-17T12:05:00.000Z	sethk	AzureLight	or do you mean you want to use it because it uses the nintendo hardware?
2007-12-17T12:05:00.000Z	AzureLight	sethk	I want to know what it is for the possibilty of using it off my Wii's browser
2007-12-17T12:06:00.000Z	sethk	AzureLight	I don't know that.  Pick a few sites and see if you can get to them.
2007-12-17T12:06:00.000Z	sethk	AzureLight	actually, just try to get on this site.  After all, we know everything so who needs any other channel?   :)
2007-12-17T12:08:00.000Z	sethk	AzureLight	I don't know, don't use Wii.
