2007-03-17T08:05:00.000Z	eck		i have done it before :-)
2007-03-17T08:07:00.000Z	eck		haha, beer and irc, a classic combination
2007-03-17T08:08:00.000Z	eck		it is the same
2007-03-17T08:08:00.000Z	eck		if you wanted full read/write support from windows of your linux partition you could use fat fine
2007-03-17T08:08:00.000Z	eck		well
2007-03-17T08:09:00.000Z	eck		well permissions would be really messed up
2007-03-17T08:09:00.000Z	eck		i guess you'd have to run things as root :-\
2007-03-17T08:09:00.000Z	sethk	eck	sure, don't forget to do rm -fr /  :)
2007-05-04T09:10:00.000Z	eck	sethk	solaris is a BSD derivative...
2007-05-04T09:10:00.000Z	sethk	eck	no
2007-05-04T09:10:00.000Z	sethk	eck	solaris is system V
2007-05-04T09:11:00.000Z	sethk	eck	there was an earlier version of solaris that was bsd
2007-05-04T09:11:00.000Z	sethk	eck	but that's ancient history, solaris v4.  solaris v5 and newer is system V
2007-05-04T09:11:00.000Z	sethk	eck	and solaris v5 goes back to the early 90's.
2007-05-04T09:11:00.000Z	eck	sethk	ah, i see
2007-05-04T09:12:00.000Z	sethk	eck	I like system V.   Ubuntu uses the system V methodology for init and stuff in the /etc directory
2007-05-04T09:13:00.000Z	eck	sethk	i'm looking at the solaris wikipedia page right now. it's nice they released a version called sun os and solaris, and then retroactively named one of the bsd releases solaris 1
2007-05-04T09:14:00.000Z	sethk	eck	yes, that's true.  It was originally called sun OS, before it became solaris 4.  I'd forgotten that.
2007-05-04T09:41:00.000Z	sethk	eck	that's c shell syntax.  ~ is the home directory, not ~username
2007-05-04T09:41:00.000Z	eck	sethk	no, read the section on tilde expansion in the bash man page
2007-05-04T09:42:00.000Z	sethk	eck	well, don't get personal, now  :)
