2010-04-10T08:21:00.000Z	Purpley		I just added a user via useradd and when i type in "users" it only lists root
2010-04-10T08:21:00.000Z	Purpley		but the user i created has a home directory and it says it exists
2010-04-10T08:23:00.000Z	Purpley		I just added a user via useradd and when i type in "users" it only lists root but the user exists why isnt it showing?
2010-04-10T08:24:00.000Z	Purpley		how do i view the users password if im root?
2010-04-10T08:24:00.000Z	Purpley		i think i may be doing it wrong
2010-04-10T08:25:00.000Z	Purpley		alright thanks
2010-04-10T08:26:00.000Z	Purpley		Does denyhost block an ip address after failing a certain number of logins?

2010-04-10T08:28:00.000Z	ziroday	Purpley	yep, or you can use fail2ban
2010-04-10T08:28:00.000Z	ziroday	Purpley	denyhosts is mainly meant for ssh, whilst fail2ban works on a number of services
2010-04-10T08:28:00.000Z	Purpley	ziroday	Lol i blocked my own ip address :P how would I take that out or give a certain ip immunity
2010-04-10T08:29:00.000Z	Purpley	ziroday	Might my ip address be listed in the cfg file?
2010-04-10T08:29:00.000Z	ziroday	Purpley	http://denyhosts.sourceforge.net/faq.html#3_7
2010-04-10T08:30:00.000Z	Purpley	ziroday	Thanks alot :)
2010-04-10T08:30:00.000Z	ziroday	Purpley	no problems
2010-04-10T08:31:00.000Z	Purpley	ziroday	Also would it be considered foolish and unsafe or bad practice to make my local networks ip addresses immune?
2010-04-10T08:31:00.000Z	ziroday	Purpley	*shrug* I just use a ssh certificate in all honesty, I don't rely on password based logins
2010-04-10T08:32:00.000Z	Purpley	ziroday	Does that mean you can only connect to the server if you have the certificate on your computer?
2010-04-10T08:32:00.000Z	ziroday	Purpley	yep
2010-04-10T08:33:00.000Z	Purpley	ziroday	Ahhh I can't use that :/ I travel often and cant be pained to remeber a usb thumbdrive :)
2010-04-10T08:33:00.000Z	ziroday	Purpley	sure, its not a suitable fit for everyone :)
