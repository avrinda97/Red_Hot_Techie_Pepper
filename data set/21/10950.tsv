2010-03-07T14:35:00.000Z	godplayer1		Can someone help with connecting a Bluetooth headset to Ubuntu 9.10
2010-03-07T14:36:00.000Z	godplayer1		It is my first time using Linux
2010-03-07T14:36:00.000Z	godplayer1		Linux is soft
2010-03-07T14:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	godplayer1	 bluetooth headsets can be a royal pain. I never did get mine working
2010-03-07T14:37:00.000Z	godplayer1		hmmm Royal is not the right word !!
2010-03-07T14:38:00.000Z	godplayer1	dnivra	- yah already done that ..
2010-03-07T14:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	godplayer1	 i recall there being some special codec that many of those headsets need and  for some reason (legal?) or somthing its  not included. and is a pain to get going right
2010-03-07T14:39:00.000Z	godplayer1		I am able to pair it ... but once connected they switch off in a second or so
2010-03-07T14:39:00.000Z	godplayer1		hrr
2010-03-07T14:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	godplayer1	 yes - i could pair mine.. but i could never get sound to come out of them. I could use them for a MiC
2010-03-07T14:40:00.000Z	godplayer1		@Dr.willis: same thing here .. so you havnt got yours to work either .. good ... some say 8.10 has no problems
2010-03-07T14:41:00.000Z	godplayer1		thank you dnivra will read that
2010-03-07T14:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	godplayer1	 with the changes to pulse audio and other subsystems. that may be the issue..
2010-03-07T14:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	godplayer1	 ive not tried it in 10.04 yet
