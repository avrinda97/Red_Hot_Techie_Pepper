2010-03-11T14:43:00.000Z	zortec		I want to try Gentoo from within Ubuntu.  Would it be possible to resize my root partition to allow space for Gentoo or do you suggest another method?
2010-03-11T14:45:00.000Z	brjann	zortec	if your CPU is recent enough to have virtualization extensions, virtualization wouldn't be that much slower
2010-03-11T14:46:00.000Z	zortec	brjann	I'm not sure if it is recent enough, my CPU is an Intel Dual Core 2.1 Ghz
2010-03-11T14:47:00.000Z	brjann	zortec	cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep model
2010-03-11T14:48:00.000Z	zortec	brjann	model 15 - Intel Pentium Dual Core E2200 @ 2.20 Ghz
2010-03-11T14:49:00.000Z	brjann	zortec	nope, no virtualization extensions on that one :(
2010-03-11T14:50:00.000Z	brjann	zortec	so long as you're not using hibernation, you can re-use the same swap partition for two distributions
2010-03-11T14:50:00.000Z	zortec	brjann	Thanks, good info
2010-03-11T15:37:00.000Z	brjann	zortec	do you have permission to extract the file to that directory?
2010-03-11T15:38:00.000Z	zortec	brjann	That was it, didn't use sudo to run the command
2010-03-11T15:39:00.000Z	zortec	brjann	I often forget to do that
2010-03-11T15:39:00.000Z	brjann	zortec	hehe, no problem
2010-03-11T15:40:00.000Z	brjann	zortec	only when your unprivileged user doesn't have the rights to do whatever it is you're trying to do
2010-03-11T15:40:00.000Z	brjann	zortec	which I admit is sort of a circular answer
2010-03-11T15:41:00.000Z	zortec	brjann	how does one tell if sudo is neededfor a command?
2010-03-11T15:41:00.000Z	zortec	brjann	I don't usually check rights before issuing any file commands
2010-03-11T15:41:00.000Z	brjann	zortec	generally speaking, your user can do pretty much whatever it wants inside /home/<your user>. outside of that, pretty much everything else is owned by root or another system account.
2010-03-11T15:42:00.000Z	zortec	brjann	the whole directory I created for gentoo is owned by root... I see that when I type "ls -l"
2010-03-11T15:43:00.000Z	brjann	zortec	as it should be, if you're installing a base system. if you installed it as your user you would have serious issues.
2010-03-11T15:43:00.000Z	zortec	brjann	appreciate the help :)
2010-03-11T15:43:00.000Z	brjann	zortec	sure thing
