2007-09-13T15:28:00.000Z	rule29		hello, was wondering if anyone has ever used one of these sata -> usb converters. i suddenly have a mount problem using one
2007-09-13T15:29:00.000Z	rule29		although i can see in dmesg that it is recognising the disk, i cannot mount it
2007-09-13T15:30:00.000Z	rule29		nup stefg
2007-09-13T15:30:00.000Z	rule29		but i see it in /dev/ as /dev/sdc
2007-09-13T15:30:00.000Z	rule29		but not as /dev/sdc1 which is what i think it probably should come up as
2007-09-13T15:31:00.000Z	rule29		ok stefg
2007-09-13T15:31:00.000Z	rule29		is there anyway to repair that?
2007-09-13T15:31:00.000Z	rule29		its this converter that did it. i accidentally plugged in the usb part before pluggin in the a/c power to the disk. :/
2007-09-13T15:31:00.000Z	rule29		hoping the disk isnt completely ruined
2007-09-13T15:31:00.000Z	hjmills	rule29	does this drive have any data on it?
2007-09-13T15:31:00.000Z	hjmills	rule29	do you think it is faulty?
2007-09-13T15:32:00.000Z	hjmills	rule29	ah
2007-09-13T15:32:00.000Z	hjmills	rule29	oh ok - maybe try looking at testdisc and recovering partition info then fscking the disk if its lost its partition info
2007-09-13T15:33:00.000Z	hjmills	rule29	thats only needed if there is no partition info but if you see no sdc1 then its probable
2007-09-13T15:34:00.000Z	hjmills	rule29	are you sure it is sdc the data is on?
2007-09-13T15:34:00.000Z	rule29	hjmills	well i unplugged it and replugged it in, and theres /dev/sdb and /dev/sdc listed. its also the only usb hdd plugged in right now
2007-09-13T15:35:00.000Z	rule29	hjmills	is that part of something else?
2007-09-13T15:36:00.000Z	hjmills	rule29	my bad - its testdisk (with a k)
2007-09-13T15:43:00.000Z	hjmills	rule29	i havent used it much I'm afraid - I just know it's meant to recover the partition table
2007-09-13T15:45:00.000Z	hjmills	rule29	http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk
2007-09-13T15:46:00.000Z	hjmills	rule29	that looks like it has some decent documentation - good luck with the drive
