2010-10-13T05:48:00.000Z	MichaelBehan		Looking up virtualbox
2010-10-13T05:49:00.000Z	MichaelBehan		thanks :)
2010-10-13T05:49:00.000Z	MichaelBehan		I would think the performance would be less with that?
2010-10-13T05:49:00.000Z	MichaelBehan		Can you start with the failsafe mode?
2010-10-13T05:51:00.000Z	MichaelBehan		er sorry
2010-10-13T05:51:00.000Z	MichaelBehan		I meant Scunizi
2010-10-13T05:51:00.000Z	MichaelBehan		^^ example only
2010-10-13T05:52:00.000Z	MichaelBehan		but still that seems like a big performance hit. I'm trying to get away from windows. I just can't partition this machine because it's a work pc
2010-10-13T05:53:00.000Z	MichaelBehan		So I'm kind of forced to use wubi and install inside windows
2010-10-13T05:54:00.000Z	MichaelBehan		And it would be defeating the purpose of trying to get away from windows UI
2010-10-13T05:54:00.000Z	blakkheim	MichaelBehan	wubi is also a performance hit
2010-10-13T05:54:00.000Z	MichaelBehan		This is a solidstate drive. I'm not as concerned with drive performance hits
2010-10-13T05:54:00.000Z	blakkheim	MichaelBehan	why can't you do a real install?
2010-10-13T05:55:00.000Z	MichaelBehan	blakkheim	It's a work laptop and that would make people angry
2010-10-13T05:55:00.000Z	MichaelBehan		If they found out
2010-10-13T05:55:00.000Z	MichaelBehan		I work for Disney, so...
2010-10-13T05:55:00.000Z	blakkheim	MichaelBehan	then maybe you shouldn't be installing linux at all on their computers
2010-10-13T05:56:00.000Z	MichaelBehan	blakkheim	I'm in a department with a little more freedom
2010-10-13T05:56:00.000Z	MichaelBehan		I don't think it will be an issue as long as I don't partition the drive.
2010-10-13T05:56:00.000Z	MichaelBehan		but this is digressing a lot.
2010-10-13T05:57:00.000Z	blakkheim	MichaelBehan	do a real install but encrypt the partition, then when you have to return it you can get rid of it and regrow the ntfs partition
