2011-01-23T06:06:00.000Z	suqa		Someone who have experience of booting via GRUB? I 've tried a cpuple of times the past hour and finds unetbootin but when I choose to "install lubuntu" it startes ubuntu instead.
2011-01-23T06:07:00.000Z	HunterBukowski	suqa	 a live disc will boot and then let you install
2011-01-23T06:09:00.000Z	HunterBukowski	suqa	 I'm not familiar with network installs, but that sounds like your only option
2011-01-23T06:10:00.000Z	HunterBukowski	suqa	 you said your BIOS doesn't support booting from USB..?
2011-01-23T06:10:00.000Z	HunterBukowski	suqa	 I'm confused
2011-01-23T06:11:00.000Z	HunterBukowski	suqa	 but you can't install it after it starts?
2011-01-23T06:13:00.000Z	HunterBukowski	suqa	 oh, ok, so it freezes on startup?
2011-01-23T06:15:00.000Z	HunterBukowski	suqa	 did you check the MD5 on the (l)ubuntu file, or try redownloading it and putting it on your flash drive again?
2011-01-23T06:18:00.000Z	HunterBukowski	suqa	 might still be worth reinstalling on the flash drive, and/or using a different USB port if possible, also check your BIOS
2011-01-23T06:19:00.000Z	suqa	HunterBukowski	I'll try that
2011-01-23T06:20:00.000Z	HunterBukowski	suqa	 you did check the system requirements, right?  I ask since you said your BIOS doesn't support flash-boot = older
2011-01-23T06:21:00.000Z	suqa	HunterBukowski	160 and less was not recommended.
2011-01-23T06:22:00.000Z	HunterBukowski	suqa	 160 what?  RAM, MHz?  That's a pretty low number for anything
2011-01-23T06:22:00.000Z	HunterBukowski	suqa	 you might try xubuntu, which is good, just less flashy
2011-01-23T06:23:00.000Z	HunterBukowski	suqa	 yes
2011-01-23T06:23:00.000Z	HunterBukowski	suqa	 try DSL, xubuntu, knoppix, or headless and then install xfce desktop
2011-01-23T06:26:00.000Z	HunterBukowski	suqa	 as bazhang said, lubuntu is another option, but yes, try xubuntu with xfce or something more compact like DSL
2011-01-23T06:28:00.000Z	HunterBukowski	suqa	 or, you could try an older version of ubuntu-- 7, 8, 9
2011-01-23T06:30:00.000Z	HunterBukowski	suqa	 I'm not sure, but that is a potential problem...  you may have to try several different distros/versions to see what your computer can handle
2011-01-23T06:31:00.000Z	HunterBukowski	suqa	 and xubuntu isn't smooth?  as in, visual anomalies or really slow?
2011-01-23T06:34:00.000Z	HunterBukowski	suqa	 D*** Small Linux is about as small as distros get...  maybe try it
