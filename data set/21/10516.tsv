2005-02-12T10:49:00.000Z	raydogg		not really, its very buggy
2005-02-12T10:49:00.000Z	raydogg		10.1 is anyway
2005-02-12T10:49:00.000Z	raydogg		10.0 was fine
2005-02-12T10:49:00.000Z	raydogg		and those type of problems always happen
2005-02-12T10:49:00.000Z	raydogg		i'm tired of it
2005-02-12T09:35:00.000Z	raydogg		is smb4k not in the warty release ?
2005-02-12T09:35:00.000Z	trey3	raydogg	in universe I believe
2005-02-12T09:36:00.000Z	trey3		its KDE... nothing for KDE is in main
2005-02-12T09:36:00.000Z	raydogg		Is there a gnome tool that does what smb4k does ?
2005-02-12T09:36:00.000Z	raydogg		i do not have kde installed
2005-02-12T09:36:00.000Z	trey3	raydogg	not well... heh
2005-02-12T09:36:00.000Z	raydogg		well, i can't play mp3s over the network using the default network browser tool :-(
2005-02-12T09:37:00.000Z	raydogg		I guess i could mount them myself
2005-02-12T09:37:00.000Z	trey3	raydogg	huh? throw them into Rhythmbox?  :/
2005-02-12T09:40:00.000Z	raydogg	trey3	i use xmms
2005-02-12T09:40:00.000Z	trey3	raydogg	that sucks  :/
2005-02-12T09:40:00.000Z	trey3	raydogg	xmms-mad though...
