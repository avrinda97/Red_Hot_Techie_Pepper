2012-09-19T20:57:00.000Z	EsoRotica		Anyone available to help with devistating system hangs ? I've check through logs, Memtest86, no clie still
2012-09-19T20:57:00.000Z	deadmund	EsoRotica	are you running the ath5k driver?
2012-09-19T20:59:00.000Z	deadmund	EsoRotica	Yep! :)  Or lspci -k  (under the wifi card)
2012-09-19T21:00:00.000Z	EsoRotica	deadmund	negatory
2012-09-19T21:01:00.000Z	deadmund	EsoRotica	Then the problem (if this ISN'T a kernel panic) is probably hardware.  Try running the computing with various hardware things not connected and see if it freezes.
2012-09-19T21:01:00.000Z	deadmund	EsoRotica	Things to try harddrive, PCI cards.  You already tried the ram
2012-09-19T21:01:00.000Z	deadmund	EsoRotica	memtest proved that works
2012-09-19T21:01:00.000Z	EsoRotica	deadmund	if it were a kernel panic, it would be in kern.log or syslog?
2012-09-19T21:01:00.000Z	deadmund	EsoRotica	yes, and you'd see a kernel dump on the screen and the keyboard lights would be blinking
2012-09-19T21:01:00.000Z	deadmund	EsoRotica	It is like christmas time
2012-09-19T21:02:00.000Z	EsoRotica	deadmund	I have had a few segfaults in the last few days. they just dont report every time
2012-09-19T21:03:00.000Z	EsoRotica	deadmund	also, there seems to be some other error along the lines of "sp1500 timer in use at address XXX"
2012-09-19T21:03:00.000Z	deadmund	EsoRotica	segfaults can be caused by lousy programming or lousy ram.  If the ram passed memtest then it is lousy programming.  Perhaps it is a different driver (besides ath5k) that is freezing the system.
2012-09-19T21:03:00.000Z	EsoRotica	deadmund	none other than flgrx im sure. however the issues are new and that has been working for some time now.
2012-09-19T21:04:00.000Z	deadmund	EsoRotica	I'm not sure then :)
2012-09-19T21:04:00.000Z	deadmund	EsoRotica	You can try radeon if you want.
2012-09-19T21:04:00.000Z	EsoRotica	deadmund	X always comes up properly with the correct layout and settings.
2012-09-19T21:07:00.000Z	EsoRotica	deadmund	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1215174/
2012-09-19T21:08:00.000Z	deadmund	EsoRotica	I'm only aware of a problem with ath5k.
2012-09-19T21:08:00.000Z	deadmund	EsoRotica	But thanks for showing me!
2012-09-19T21:08:00.000Z	EsoRotica	deadmund	Thanks for you help.
