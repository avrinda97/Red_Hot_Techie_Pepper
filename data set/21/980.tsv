2011-04-22T09:28:00.000Z	soreau	xxmmaann	What driver did you install and what card do you have?
2011-04-22T09:29:00.000Z	soreau	xxmmaann	Ick. You should have used sys>admin>additional drivers applet to install the nvidia driver
2011-04-22T09:29:00.000Z	soreau	xxmmaann	Try booting to CLI then 'rm -rf /etc/X11/xorg.conf' then reboot
2011-04-22T09:30:00.000Z	xxmmaann	soreau	i know bit i cant start my sistem it starts with comand line
2011-04-22T09:31:00.000Z	soreau	xxmmaann	Try booting to CLI (CLI = Command Line Interface) then 'rm -rf /etc/X11/xorg.conf' then reboot
2011-04-22T09:34:00.000Z	soreau	xxmmaann	I already told you what to try
2011-04-22T09:35:00.000Z	soreau	xxmmaann	If you can't follow any instruction, no one will be able to help you
2011-04-22T09:51:00.000Z	xxmmaann	soreau	> i tryed that comand and not work , any ideas?
2011-04-22T09:54:00.000Z	soreau	xxmmaann	Perhaps you should try undoing what you did with apt-get remove --purge *nvidia*
2011-04-22T10:00:00.000Z	soreau	xxmmaann	The nvidia module is loading and apparently, it's broken
2011-04-22T10:02:00.000Z	soreau	xxmmaann	Try creating /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nvidia and put nvidia on a single line in it
2011-04-22T10:07:00.000Z	soreau	xxmmaann	sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nvidia, then type nvidia and press Ctrl+X, then hit Y and enter
2011-04-22T10:10:00.000Z	soreau	xxmmaann	Yes, you can mount the root filesystem and create the file
2011-04-22T10:16:00.000Z	soreau	xxmmaann	Are you sure you created it on the filesystem on the hard drive and not on the live session file system?
2011-06-25T22:35:00.000Z	soreau	xxmmaann	Sounds like it could be a problem with your webcam driver initialization routine </guess>
2011-06-25T22:35:00.000Z	soreau	xxmmaann	Try filing a bug report
2011-06-25T22:36:00.000Z	soreau	xxmmaann	Have you tried running the applications from terminal to see if there's any interesting output?
2011-06-25T22:47:00.000Z	soreau	xxmmaann	Sure, just have it reload the module
