2009-03-16T23:34:00.000Z	titon		hi i got a question. if u install using the alternativ cd and chose a full encryption using the whole disc by using automatic partioining using the fulldisk....does that give me an encrypted swap as well?
2009-03-16T23:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	titon	encrypted swap heh.  do you even know what that is?
2009-03-16T23:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	titon	 your data does not go on swap
2009-03-16T23:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb		!ot | shiny_people
2009-03-16T23:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb		!backup
2009-03-16T23:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb		!sbackup
2009-03-16T23:38:00.000Z	titon	sebsebseb	yes what ever doesnt fit in ur memory will go in ur swap.....and when u hibernate
2009-03-16T23:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb		!cloning
2009-03-16T23:38:00.000Z	titon		and i dont want aything to be found....
2009-03-16T23:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	titon	yeah something like that,  but encrypted swap hum
2009-03-16T23:38:00.000Z	titon		i think it is encrypted but not sure
2009-03-16T23:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	titon	well the alternate CD is meant to be able to do whole  hard disk encryption, so I guess that will include the swap
2009-03-16T23:39:00.000Z	titon		but if it shows up on /dev/mapper i guess it mst be
2009-03-16T23:39:00.000Z	titon		but its encrypted with same key and thats fine...i know u can just have it randomly encryptd each time u boot
2009-03-16T23:39:00.000Z	titon		messes up the hibernate thingy so havng same key for swap works
2009-03-16T23:40:00.000Z	titon		<sebsebseb> titon:  your data does not go on swap........ hmm seb can i ask if u know what a swap is :P
2009-03-16T23:40:00.000Z	titon		hehehe thf for help though....had to be a lill smart ass back
2009-03-16T23:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb		!swap | titon
2009-03-16T23:41:00.000Z	titon		 It can also be used as extra memory if you don't have enough.   of so my data do go in the swap then :D
2009-03-16T23:41:00.000Z	titon		i know i know just bugging sebsebseb
2009-03-16T23:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	titon	swap is mainly for people with shitty amount of RAM :D  I guess, but  I ran quite nicely with no swap on 1GB so :d
