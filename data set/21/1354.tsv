2011-05-18T22:02:00.000Z	Atlantic777		Hi! I'm trying to install shotwell 0.8+ on Lucid but without success for now. I've added yorba's and felxio-something's too. No help.
2011-05-18T22:02:00.000Z	Atlantic777		Any idea? Btw, is there any other app for image collections with video support?
2011-05-18T22:03:00.000Z	KM0201	Atlantic777	picasa maybe?
2011-05-18T22:03:00.000Z	Atlantic777	KM0201	picasa doesn't play videos on GNU/Linux AFAIK.
2011-05-18T22:03:00.000Z	KM0201	Atlantic777	ok... what version of shotwell do you have, and you're trying to install .8?
2011-05-18T22:04:00.000Z	Atlantic777	KM0201	current version is 0.7.2 from yorba's ppa, and I'm looking for 0.8 or 0.9.
2011-05-18T22:04:00.000Z	Atlantic777	KM0201	0.8 should have video support too.
2011-05-18T22:04:00.000Z	Atlantic777	KM0201	btw, I can install it from source, but...
2011-05-18T22:05:00.000Z	KM0201	Atlantic777	well, looking at their instructions, the yorba repository for .9 only works w/ maverick... so.. thats why its not working... unless you find another repo, your only option is to compile from source
2011-05-18T22:06:00.000Z	Atlantic777	KM0201	ok... do I have to remove current shotwell before compiling it?
2011-05-18T22:06:00.000Z	KM0201	Atlantic777	wait, have yout ried the "flexion" PPA, and it still didn't work?
2011-05-18T22:07:00.000Z	Atlantic777	KM0201	yeah. Still nothing.
2011-05-18T22:07:00.000Z	KM0201	Atlantic777	that would probably be a good idea...
2011-05-18T22:07:00.000Z	Atlantic777	KM0201	ok...
2011-05-18T22:07:00.000Z	KM0201	Atlantic777	you can probably back up /home/user/.shotwell  if you want to save your configuration.
2011-05-18T22:07:00.000Z	Atlantic777	KM0201	great idea. :D
2011-05-18T22:09:00.000Z	KM0201	Atlantic777	there's instructions here for backing up shotwell, etc.. i would do that, then uninstall it, then compile from source.. http://trac.yorba.org/wiki/Shotwell/FAQ#CanIrunShotwell0.9.0onUbuntu10.04LucidLynx
2011-05-18T22:09:00.000Z	KM0201	Atlantic777	they also have instructions on that site for compiling it from source...
2011-05-18T22:10:00.000Z	Atlantic777	KM0201	gentoo user here, don't worry. :D
2011-05-18T22:10:00.000Z	KM0201	Atlantic777	then why are you here
2011-05-18T22:10:00.000Z	Atlantic777	KM0201	because my father uses ubuntu. :D
