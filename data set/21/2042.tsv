2011-05-13T07:15:00.000Z	roothorick		what? I did ask my questions...
2011-05-13T07:16:00.000Z	roothorick		sigh... X is freezing, I haven't been able to figure out why so far
2011-05-13T07:17:00.000Z	roothorick		it only does it if the screen turns off, either from closing the lid or from sitting idle
2011-05-13T07:17:00.000Z	roothorick		and then only sometimes but it's getting worse
2011-05-13T07:17:00.000Z	roothorick		I can get the computer back into a usable state by killing X from a terminal
2011-05-13T07:17:00.000Z	roothorick		but I lose my whole session
2011-05-13T07:19:00.000Z	roothorick		Intel integrated GMA something-or-other
2011-05-13T07:19:00.000Z	roothorick		945GM I think
2011-05-13T07:19:00.000Z	roothorick		whatever drivers Natty installs by default
2011-05-13T07:20:00.000Z	roothorick		is there a known problem with Intel graphics?
2011-05-13T07:21:00.000Z	ohsix	roothorick	short answer is yes
2011-05-13T07:22:00.000Z	roothorick	ohsix	long answer?
2011-05-13T07:22:00.000Z	ohsix	roothorick	theres a bug about it on launchpad with kernels rolled with the fix in them available
2011-05-13T07:22:00.000Z	roothorick	ohsix	I wouldn't suppose you have a link?
2011-05-13T07:29:00.000Z	roothorick	ohsix	he shouldn't be using Wine at all for his purpose
2011-05-13T07:43:00.000Z	ohsix	roothorick	that was always true with apm, but with acpi the os can elect to control the fans using the thermal zone information, or acpi can do it itself; it's all down to whether those zones are correct
2011-05-13T08:02:00.000Z	ohsix	roothorick	wat
2011-05-13T08:02:00.000Z	roothorick	ohsix	you mean Natty will run nicely without tweaks on a machine from 2003?
2011-05-13T08:03:00.000Z	ohsix	roothorick	that is different from the system requirements, at least
2011-05-13T08:04:00.000Z	roothorick	ohsix	WinXP will run nicely on machines that simply don't have and cannot have enough RAM to run recent Ubuntu comfortably
2011-05-13T08:06:00.000Z	roothorick	ohsix	ergo complaints of "slow" and "Windows was better" on machines that are just too flipping old
