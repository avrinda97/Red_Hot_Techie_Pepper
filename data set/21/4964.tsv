2011-09-22T16:55:00.000Z	wereHamster		why would ssh pubkey authentication not work from a 8.04.4 client to a 10.04 server?
2011-09-22T16:55:00.000Z	wereHamster		the key is silently ignored by the server
2011-09-22T16:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wereHamster	tried reimporting the key?
2011-09-22T16:56:00.000Z	wereHamster	ActionParsnip	import where? Both are servers, there are no agents running
2012-04-18T15:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wereHamster	try:  dpkg -S sources.list
2012-04-18T15:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wereHamster	There are sample files online, or you can boot the liveCD/USB and copy the default one from there  to your internal partition
2012-04-18T15:49:00.000Z	wereHamster	ActionParsnip	no, I don't want to edit that file. I want to know against which package to report a bug.
2012-04-18T15:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wereHamster	edit what file?
2012-04-18T15:50:00.000Z	wereHamster	ActionParsnip	Suppose there is a bug in sources.list. Where do I report the bug?
2012-04-18T15:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wereHamster	oic, then report it against the apt package
2012-04-18T15:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wereHamster	sources.list won't have bugs, its a config file
2012-04-18T15:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wereHamster	what issues are you seeing?
2012-04-18T15:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wereHamster	then thats an issue witht that server, not the sources.list file
2012-04-18T15:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wereHamster	i'd still use apt as the thing to report against
2012-04-18T15:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wereHamster	is there a change you need to make to make it use ipv6?
2012-04-18T15:53:00.000Z	wereHamster	ActionParsnip	IPv6-only network
2012-04-18T15:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wereHamster	is there no change you can make to use ipv6, to the sources.list file?
2012-04-18T15:55:00.000Z	wereHamster	ActionParsnip	sure I can. That's what I did. But IMO I shouldn't have to edit that file, the default installation should just work.
2012-04-18T15:56:00.000Z	wereHamster	ActionParsnip	there is no reason us.archive.ubuntu.com (or the default servers that are in sources.list) shouldn't be reachable through IPv6
2012-04-18T15:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wereHamster	I guess, depends on DNS
2012-04-18T15:58:00.000Z	wereHamster	ActionParsnip	dig AAAA us.archive.ubuntu.com. Try it for yourself.
