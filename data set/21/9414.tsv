2005-09-30T09:27:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	grabbies200	what does ifconfig -a show? ... do not paste here
2005-09-30T09:34:00.000Z	grabbies200	nomasteryoda	i cannot paste because it is on another computer, it gives me the ip address 192.168.1.103, the netmask 255.255.255.0 the broadcast 192.1680.1.255 do you need something else?

2005-09-30T09:36:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	grabbies200	what does "route -n" show?
2005-09-30T09:51:00.000Z	grabbies200	nomasteryoda	i am on it thanks
2005-09-30T09:38:00.000Z	grabbies200	nomasteryoda	destinatio 102.168.1.0 gateway 0.0.0.0 genmask 255.255.255.0 flags u metric 0 ref 0 use 0 eth0
2005-09-30T09:38:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	grabbies200	for some reason it is not getting the gateway
2005-09-30T09:38:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	grabbies200	you can add manually
2005-09-30T09:39:00.000Z	grabbies200	nomasteryoda	ok i can try but i cannot use any x application
2005-09-30T09:39:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	grabbies200	np
2005-09-30T09:40:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	grabbies200	try 'man ifconfig'
2005-09-30T09:41:00.000Z	grabbies200	nomasteryoda	ok i go try thanks, is the gatway address the same of the router address?
2005-09-30T09:41:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	grabbies200	that should be the same
2005-09-30T09:45:00.000Z	grabbies200	nomasteryoda	i looked the man page of ifconfig but there is nothing about gateway
2005-09-30T09:47:00.000Z	grabbies200	nomasteryoda	is there a file i can modify so at restart it will set the gateway correctly?
2005-09-30T09:49:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	grabbies200	gedit /etc/network/interfaces
2005-09-30T09:50:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	grabbies200	look at "man interfaces
2005-09-30T09:58:00.000Z	grabbies200	nomasteryoda	reset the interfaces files and configuration worked fine, THANKS!
