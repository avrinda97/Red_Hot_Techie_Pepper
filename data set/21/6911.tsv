2007-10-02T11:39:00.000Z	riotkittie		and i still cant get rt2x00 to work for me :|
2007-10-02T11:39:00.000Z	riotkittie		but whatever. :D
2007-10-02T11:41:00.000Z	riotkittie		or you can sudo invoke-rc.d gdm restart
2007-10-02T11:41:00.000Z	riotkittie		or sudo /ect/init.d/ gdm restart
2007-10-02T11:43:00.000Z	riotkittie		i like nice, minimal, subdued themes. i wish i could find a decent dark one, tho.
2007-10-02T11:44:00.000Z	riotkittie		it drives me Krazy. on the rare occasion i hate myself enough to install kde
2007-10-02T11:46:00.000Z	riotkittie		if there'd been personal computers. aye.  <hides>
2007-10-02T11:48:00.000Z	riotkittie		thank you for making me feel young. i needed that :P
2007-10-02T11:49:00.000Z	therealnanotube	riotkittie	hehe, sorry, if you need impetus to "feel young", you know you're gettin' old. :P
2007-10-02T12:32:00.000Z	therealnanotube	riotkittie	what for you need a pci slot?
2007-10-02T12:33:00.000Z	riotkittie	therealnanotube	so that i tape my wireless dongle to a large pile of dynamite, and get something that doesnt suck
2007-10-02T12:34:00.000Z	therealnanotube	riotkittie	ahhehe i see :)
2007-10-02T12:35:00.000Z	therealnanotube	riotkittie	if it's a desktop, maybe you could take out your wired NIC, and put a wireless one in its place?
2007-10-02T12:36:00.000Z	riotkittie	therealnanotube	i think the only supported wireless ones all have the prism chipset, and ... well, ugh.
2007-10-02T12:36:00.000Z	therealnanotube	riotkittie	heh
2007-10-02T12:36:00.000Z	therealnanotube	riotkittie	well, either you want working wireless, or you don't ;)
2007-10-02T12:38:00.000Z	riotkittie	therealnanotube	my last dongle had a prism chip, and really, i'd rather go through labor and delivery again than mess with another one. :P
2007-10-02T12:39:00.000Z	therealnanotube	riotkittie	at least you'll have a working human at the end, right? :)
2007-10-02T12:39:00.000Z	therealnanotube	riotkittie	aren't there any pci wifi cards that have non-prism chips?
2007-10-02T12:40:00.000Z	therealnanotube	riotkittie	i don't know myself - i just have the intel 2200bg in my laptop, and it works, so i never had to learn about wifi chipsets and all that cruft.
2007-10-02T12:41:00.000Z	riotkittie	therealnanotube	yes but my pci slots are packed with gfx, sound, and eSATA cards :|
