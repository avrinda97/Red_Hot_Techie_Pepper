2008-10-07T22:37:00.000Z	Cool-Nick	v0lksman	yeah
2008-10-07T22:37:00.000Z	v0lksman	Cool-Nick	what part?
2008-10-07T22:40:00.000Z	Cool-Nick	v0lksman	during loading. Actually i couldn't insall ubuntu using GUI cuz it was rebooting in the same spot while it loads the GUI, so i installed it using the alternate CD, but the same problem happens when it is loading. Also i couldn't use the live version cuz it reboots at that point also. I can't never reach the desktop or any GUI, it reboots during loading the system.

2008-10-07T22:42:00.000Z	Cool-Nick	v0lksman	Calorido nvidia AGP 256
2008-10-07T22:44:00.000Z	Cool-Nick	v0lksman	i can't remember what Geforce is
2008-10-07T22:45:00.000Z	v0lksman	Cool-Nick	hrm...never heard of Calorido...not sure what that is...
2008-10-07T22:47:00.000Z	Cool-Nick	v0lksman	i think it's Colorado
2008-10-07T22:48:00.000Z	Cool-Nick	v0lksman	maybe it's a Chinese company
2008-10-07T22:48:00.000Z	v0lksman	Cool-Nick	would make sense cause I got a bunch of results in Chinese.. :)
2008-10-07T22:48:00.000Z	Cool-Nick	v0lksman	i think so
2008-10-07T22:49:00.000Z	v0lksman	Cool-Nick	might want to check the forums and see if anyone has the same card...may help
2008-10-07T22:49:00.000Z	Cool-Nick	v0lksman	why? Do you belive that the problem is from the grahpics card?
