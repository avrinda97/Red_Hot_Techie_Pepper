2010-12-19T01:02:00.000Z	deddly		I'm fed up with this. Why does sound work perfectly in a DSL  distribution from 2004 but Ubuntu 10.04 crackles and pops and cliks??
2010-12-19T01:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	deddly	 ive seen some issues with sound card/power saver features causing pops and noises when the card is woken up.
2010-12-19T01:04:00.000Z	deddly	Dr_Willis	This is constans, regular popping
2010-12-19T01:04:00.000Z	deddly	Dr_Willis	constant*
2010-12-19T01:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	deddly	 check the forums and bug reports for your exact chipset see if any one has some potential fixs perjhaps.
2010-12-19T01:05:00.000Z	deddly	Dr_Willis	All I've found is people saying sound works perfectly out of the box. Now I've tried installing Open Sound System and I get no sound at all, the player just skips to the next track on the playlist
2010-12-19T01:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	deddly	 when you do things like that. theres often no magic simple fix.
2010-12-19T01:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	deddly	 fire up package manager , remove what ever oss stuff you installed.. reinstall alsa.
2010-12-19T01:16:00.000Z	deddly	Dr_Willis	I did everything from the command line according to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OpenSound ... Now it jsut skips to the next file every time I try playing an mp3
2010-12-19T01:17:00.000Z	deddly	Dr_Willis	So saying jsut uninstall is tricky for me when I don't have instructions to follow
2010-12-19T01:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	deddly	 You could always try  the next release. see if sound works in the alpha. if not file a bug report. perhas it will get fixed befor the next release is finalized.
2010-12-19T01:18:00.000Z	deddly	Dr_Willis	I can't install anything newer than 10.04 because the new installer won't work
2010-12-19T01:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	deddly	 you filed a but on the installer not working?
2010-12-19T01:23:00.000Z	deddly	Dr_Willis	No, I've never filed a bug...don't know how
2010-12-19T13:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	deddly	 what OSS did you install exactly?
2010-12-19T13:53:00.000Z	deddly	Dr_Willis	I followed https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OpenSound
2010-12-19T13:54:00.000Z	deddly	Dr_Willis	I only installed OSS because I thought it might help me get rid of the crackling noise
2010-12-19T13:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	deddly	  youmay want to try updaeting the alsa drivers/system.
2010-12-19T13:55:00.000Z	deddly	Dr_Willis	First, though, Gstreamer codecs are the ones I want, right?
2010-12-19T13:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	deddly	 Huh? I always install ubuntu-restrict3ed-extras
2010-12-19T13:56:00.000Z	deddly	Dr_Willis	Oh ok I'll try that
