2009-03-22T22:40:00.000Z	brous		I tried to make a bootable usb dongle with 8.10 but it does not run on dell laptops, its fat16 format, it runs on hp, is this unique?
2009-03-22T22:40:00.000Z	brous		Frijolie-> nope
2009-03-22T22:41:00.000Z	Gnea	brous	is there a documented process that you followed in order to get it installed?
2009-03-22T22:42:00.000Z	brous	Gnea	 this  http://www.pendrivelinux.com/ubuntu-810-install-using-the-built-in-usb-installer/
2009-03-22T22:44:00.000Z	Gnea	brous	ok, well fat16 is correct, not sure why the dell isn't accepting it.. what's the make/model of the dell?
2009-03-22T22:51:00.000Z	Gnea	brous	that a desktop?
2009-03-22T22:52:00.000Z	Gnea	brous	is the G630 a desktop model?
2009-03-22T22:52:00.000Z	Gnea	brous	ok, that an inspiron?
2009-03-22T22:52:00.000Z	brous	Gnea	am not sure, if its inspiron, let me look for any labels outside or stickers
2009-03-22T22:54:00.000Z	Gnea	brous	ATG, to be specific.  yeah, it's dell, they get a bit carried away with product branding :)
2009-03-22T22:57:00.000Z	Gnea	brous	does the bios provide you the option to boot from a usb device?
2009-03-22T23:00:00.000Z	brous	Gnea	the error was error loading operating system
2009-03-22T23:03:00.000Z	Gnea	brous	that's nuts.. do you have the option to boot from a network device?
2009-03-22T23:04:00.000Z	brous	Gnea	yeah there is that option
2009-03-22T23:04:00.000Z	Gnea	brous	k, do you have another linux system setup or is this your only computer?
2009-03-22T23:04:00.000Z	Gnea	brous	aaah...
2009-03-22T23:05:00.000Z	brous	Gnea	yes, i have another linux, i just want to let my partner to try linux, on her laptop
2009-03-22T23:05:00.000Z	Gnea	brous	have you tried all of the usb ports?
2009-03-22T23:10:00.000Z	Gnea	brous	that's a tough one... does the cd drive not work?
2009-03-22T23:12:00.000Z	Gnea	brous	well, if it works good on the HP, then it'll probably work fine on a lot, but as you've encountered, you'll find a random system now and then that simply won't be able to boot from usb... the only other thing that I can think of is updating the bios, if you haven't already
2009-03-22T23:13:00.000Z	Gnea	brous	understandable. it probably has the usb-boot safe-guardedly blocked then.
