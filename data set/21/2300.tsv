2012-01-25T17:24:00.000Z	richthegeek		hi, I got a new mobo today that uses UEFI - will GRUB work with this automatically (from a fresh install) or do I have to do something more?
2012-01-25T17:24:00.000Z	KrisDouglas	richthegeek	 I have not had any problems with my UEFI board
2012-01-25T17:26:00.000Z	richthegeek	KrisDouglas	thanks - i'll give it a shot in a few hours (in work atm) but hopefully it'll work like a charm (unlike my gfx card)
2012-01-25T17:26:00.000Z	KrisDouglas		!ops
2012-01-25T17:26:00.000Z	KrisDouglas	richthegeek	what graphics card do you have?
2012-01-25T17:27:00.000Z	richthegeek		AMD 6850
2012-01-25T17:27:00.000Z	richthegeek		feels wrong saying AMD instead of ATI ...
2012-01-25T17:27:00.000Z	KrisDouglas		haha
2012-01-25T17:27:00.000Z	richthegeek		it was working on a prior install but it just doesn't have 3d accel anymore
2012-01-25T17:27:00.000Z	KrisDouglas		I haven't had a problem with that card if you use the binary drivers from the ATI website
2012-01-25T17:28:00.000Z	KrisDouglas		should in fact automatically install ones that will give you 3D from the 11.10 driver manager
2012-01-25T17:28:00.000Z	richthegeek	KrisDouglas	any terminal magic I need to do? something like "aticonfig --initial" for example?
2012-01-25T17:30:00.000Z	KrisDouglas		assuming you are on 32bit (there is a x64 one too): http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/linux/Pages/radeon_linux.aspx?type=2.4.1&product=2.4.1.3.42&lang=English
2012-01-25T17:30:00.000Z	KrisDouglas		will do it all for you
2012-01-25T17:30:00.000Z	richthegeek	KrisDouglas	thanks :)
2012-01-25T17:30:00.000Z	KrisDouglas		download it to your home directory
2012-01-25T17:30:00.000Z	KrisDouglas		reboot into recovery mode, open a terminal window
2012-01-25T17:30:00.000Z	KrisDouglas		sudo chmod +x <driverfilename>
2012-01-25T17:30:00.000Z	KrisDouglas		then ./<driverfilename>
2012-01-25T17:31:00.000Z	richthegeek		awesome
2012-01-25T17:31:00.000Z	KrisDouglas	richthegeek	on a fresh install that works every time for my 6950
