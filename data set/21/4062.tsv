2008-07-23T03:07:00.000Z	wlievens		I'm actually working on setting up the server for the new version right now
2008-07-23T03:07:00.000Z	wlievens		alpha test coming up soon
2008-07-23T03:08:00.000Z	wlievens		unfortunately I'm a horrible newbie at linux administration
2008-07-23T03:09:00.000Z	wlievens		thing is I am not at liberty to just change distor because it's a VPS server
2008-07-23T03:11:00.000Z	wlievens		typing
2008-07-23T03:11:00.000Z	wlievens		:)
2008-07-23T03:12:00.000Z	wlievens		I need apache 2.2 for a feature in mod_proxy that I'm missing, but another module doesn't exist as a package for apache2.2 for dapper
2008-07-23T03:12:00.000Z	wlievens		so I'm *trying* now to build those modules myself
2008-07-23T03:12:00.000Z	Flannel	wlievens	Apache 2.2 isn't in dapper.  Apache 2 is.
2008-07-23T03:12:00.000Z	Flannel	wlievens	You should probably consider upgrading to Hardy if you need apache2.2
2008-07-23T03:12:00.000Z	wlievens	Flannel	I found a backport somewhere, I think
2008-07-23T03:13:00.000Z	wlievens	Flannel	can you just upgrade the distro on a VPS?
2008-07-23T03:13:00.000Z	Flannel	wlievens	You can upgrade dapper to hardy, yes.
2008-07-23T03:14:00.000Z	Flannel	wlievens	First remove the third party packages
2008-07-23T03:16:00.000Z	Flannel	wlievens	Dapper to Hardy isn't skipping.
2008-07-23T03:17:00.000Z	Flannel	wlievens	If you were going to upgrade piecewise, you need to go Dapper Edgy Feisty Gutsy Hardy.  Or you can go LTS to LTS, Dapper to Hardy (scroll down further in the Hardy upgrade notes)
2008-07-23T03:18:00.000Z	Flannel	wlievens	Perhaps you should call up your hosting provider and ask.
2008-07-23T03:19:00.000Z	Flannel	wlievens	They might be able to upgrade you to Hardy without you needing to do anything
2008-07-23T03:19:00.000Z	wlievens	Flannel	good point
2008-07-23T03:24:00.000Z	wlievens	Flannel	I've mailed my host support
