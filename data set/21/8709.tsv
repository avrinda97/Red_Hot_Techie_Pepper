2006-02-26T15:46:00.000Z	eedge		I'm still getting "The file/boot/grub/stage1 not read correctly errors", please help!
2006-02-26T15:47:00.000Z	iBalo	eedge	you moved partitions, didn't you?
2006-02-26T15:47:00.000Z	eedge		I don't think i moved partitions?
2006-02-26T15:47:00.000Z	eedge		if I do find /boot/grub/stage1 its there.
2006-02-26T15:47:00.000Z	eedge		I can see it!
2006-02-26T15:48:00.000Z	iBalo	eedge	then you might have a flaky harddrive
2006-02-26T15:48:00.000Z	eedge		Well, any suggestions?
2006-02-26T15:48:00.000Z	eedge		lol
2006-02-26T15:48:00.000Z	iBalo	eedge	are you in ubuntu now?
2006-02-26T15:48:00.000Z	eedge		yes, well, the live CD.
2006-02-26T15:49:00.000Z	eedge	iBalo	yes I am.
2006-02-26T15:50:00.000Z	iBalo	eedge	then mount your ubuntu hd-partition and copy /boot/grub/directory over _EXCEPT_ _the_ _menu.lst_
2006-02-26T15:51:00.000Z	eedge	iBalo	where would I copy it to?
2006-02-26T15:51:00.000Z	iBalo	eedge	whats your ubuntu partition?
2006-02-26T15:51:00.000Z	eedge		hda4
2006-02-26T15:52:00.000Z	eedge	iBalo	hda4
2006-02-26T15:52:00.000Z	iBalo	eedge	so 'sudo mount /dev/hda4 /mnt'
2006-02-26T15:53:00.000Z	eedge		yes... I've done that.
2006-02-26T15:54:00.000Z	eedge	iBalo	i've done that.
2006-02-26T15:54:00.000Z	eedge		How else would I be accessing it!
2006-02-26T15:54:00.000Z	iBalo	eedge	what does 'ls /mnt/boot/grub' yield?
