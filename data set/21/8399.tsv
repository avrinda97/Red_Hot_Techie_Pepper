2006-04-13T08:11:00.000Z	_jason	delonnor	you know mplayer is in the multiverse repository?
2006-04-13T08:12:00.000Z	delonnor	_jason	yes, i do...i just like to compile it, i tend to always do that
2006-04-13T08:12:00.000Z	_jason	delonnor	are you compiling cvs?
2006-04-13T08:14:00.000Z	delonnor	_jason	as far as i know
2006-04-13T08:15:00.000Z	_jason	delonnor	what does that mean?  where did you get the source :P
2006-04-13T08:16:00.000Z	delonnor	_jason	got it right from mplayerhq.hu
2006-04-13T08:17:00.000Z	_jason	delonnor	so did you just download the tarball for v1.0pre7try2 right?  you didn't issue some cvs commands in a terminal?
2006-04-13T08:19:00.000Z	delonnor	_jason	... i ./configured it
2006-04-13T08:21:00.000Z	_jason	delonnor	ok... 'll assume you are using v1.0pre7try2 .  Can you pastebin the output?
2006-04-13T08:22:00.000Z	delonnor	_jason	... how do i pastebin...? just copy and paste?
2006-04-13T08:22:00.000Z	_jason	delonnor	yeah just copy and apste to http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ and give us a link
2006-04-13T08:24:00.000Z	delonnor	_jason	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/11766
2006-04-13T08:26:00.000Z	_jason	delonnor	the version of mplayer you have only compiles with gcc-3.4 iirc.  Have you install gcc-3.4?
2006-04-13T08:28:00.000Z	_jason	delonnor	sudo aptitude install build-essential gcc-3.4, you need both of those to build it
2006-04-13T08:31:00.000Z	delonnor	_jason	ty...i know i forgot somwthing!
