2010-05-03T03:49:00.000Z	ratatim		I receive this error when I put my flash drive in my notebook: "Error mounting: mount exited with exit code 1: helper failed with:
2010-05-03T03:49:00.000Z	ratatim		mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdb1,
2010-05-03T03:49:00.000Z	ratatim		       missing codepage or helper program, or other error

2010-05-03T03:50:00.000Z	ratatim		what should I do?
2010-05-03T03:50:00.000Z	lfaraone	ratatim	reads like your flash drive's filesystem is unreadable to Ubuntu.
2010-05-03T03:50:00.000Z	lfaraone	ratatim	what FS do you have it, and does it work elsewhere?
2010-05-03T03:50:00.000Z	ratatim	lfaraone	sorry I'm not sure what FS means.
2010-05-03T03:51:00.000Z	lfaraone	ratatim	Filesystem. "fat", "ntfs", "hfs+", "ext3" are all filesystems.
2010-05-03T03:51:00.000Z	ratatim	lfaraone	I believe its fat
2010-05-03T03:52:00.000Z	lfaraone	ratatim	does it work on other systems?
2010-05-03T03:52:00.000Z	lfaraone	ratatim	by "work", I mean "did you try it since it stopped working in ubuntu".
2010-05-03T03:52:00.000Z	ratatim	lfaraone	yes it does. It works on both windows and mac machines
2010-05-03T03:53:00.000Z	lfaraone	ratatim	odd.
2010-05-03T03:54:00.000Z	ratatim	lfaraone	when I ran 8.04 it just said it couldn't mount. I figured 10.04 might have fixed the problem I was having
2010-05-03T03:54:00.000Z	lfaraone	ratatim	At least now it tells you what's wrong :) Is this a U3 or some other "non-normal" flash drive? Do other flash drives work on the same computer?
2010-05-03T03:55:00.000Z	ratatim	lfaraone	I'll try my other flash drive. I thought i got ride of U3 on the flash drive
2010-05-03T03:56:00.000Z	ratatim	lfaraone	I get the same message with my Kingston flash drive
2010-05-03T03:56:00.000Z	lfaraone	ratatim	odd. no idea.
2010-05-03T03:56:00.000Z	ratatim	lfaraone	ok thanks
