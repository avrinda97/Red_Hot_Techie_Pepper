2010-08-04T13:21:00.000Z	soreau	classical	You should recognize what commands should be run as user and which to be run as root. Rule of thumb is, you should always know why you need to run a command with superuser privileges before running it. Otherwise, always use user
2010-08-04T13:22:00.000Z	soreau	classical	In addition to security issues, running user commands as root can potentially cause permissions issues
2010-08-04T13:24:00.000Z	soreau	classical	Like I said, you should understand why any command needs to be run as root and that includes scripts
2010-08-04T13:26:00.000Z	soreau	classical	and you need to understand why. What script are you referring to in this case?
2010-08-04T13:27:00.000Z	classical	soreau	backup for example
2010-08-04T13:28:00.000Z	soreau	classical	As long as your user has write access to wherever you are backing up *to*, then you should be able to run it as user

2010-08-04T13:42:00.000Z	soreau	classical	VISUAL=$TEXT_EDITOR crontab -e where TEXT_EDITOR is your test editor of choice
2010-08-04T13:44:00.000Z	soreau	classical	For example, to use gedit as your test editor, run: VISUAL=gedit crontab -e
2010-08-04T13:47:00.000Z	classical	soreau	haha its opens with gedit
2010-08-04T13:48:00.000Z	classical	soreau	nice :-)
2010-08-04T13:48:00.000Z	soreau	classical	That is the whole point ;)
2010-08-04T13:50:00.000Z	soreau	classical	Using sudo, you would do something like this: VISUAL=gedit sudo -E crontab -e
2010-08-04T13:52:00.000Z	soreau	classical	The amount and quality of support you get largely depends on what you ask and how you ask it, revealing the knowledge you have already
2010-08-04T13:53:00.000Z	classical	soreau	yep :-)
2010-08-04T14:47:00.000Z	soreau	classical	When you run commands in crontab, they are in a sterile environment as ikonia suggested. You will need to set the DISPLAY environment variable to whatever X session you want an X program opened in
2010-08-04T14:47:00.000Z	soreau	classical	Typically, DISPLAY=:0 will suffice
2010-08-04T14:49:00.000Z	classical	soreau	my firefox is running now in background ?
2010-08-04T14:50:00.000Z	soreau	classical	No, it failed to start. For example, run it from a tty and see what it says
2010-08-04T14:54:00.000Z	classical	soreau	ubottu ikonia i understood :-)   i will try something non graphical :-)
