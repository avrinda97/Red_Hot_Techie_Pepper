2005-02-03T12:42:00.000Z	pestil	K-Rich	is it possible to bring it back without killing it all? I've been dowloading a huge file for hours and it will be done in about half hour
2005-02-03T12:42:00.000Z	K-Rich	pestil	the file should continue to download :)
2005-02-03T12:48:00.000Z	pestil	K-Rich	it gave me the error dialog again, but this time the menus came back!!!! WOOOHOOOOOO!
2005-02-03T12:49:00.000Z	pestil	K-Rich	where'd you know so much?? I swallowed most all the ubuntu forums and couldn't come up with that?

2005-02-03T12:53:00.000Z	pestil	K-Rich	moments like this are where Ubuntu shines at making good impressions. GRANTED IF THERE'S XCHAT ACCESS

2005-02-03T12:56:00.000Z	pestil	K-Rich	thanks for the 911, man.
2005-02-03T12:56:00.000Z	pestil	K-Rich	just before I leave, umm, does what I just experienced happen a lot? Is there a way to avoid it in the future?
2005-02-03T12:56:00.000Z	pestil	K-Rich	heck, without those two menus, people die!
2005-02-03T12:57:00.000Z	K-Rich	pestil	i've had it happen 2 times in 4 years :P
2005-02-03T12:57:00.000Z	K-Rich	pestil	naw, as long as you can get to a terminal :)
2005-02-03T12:59:00.000Z	pestil	K-Rich	last question, I promise. How do I get to applications:/// from the terminal? without using nautilus? (just in case)
2005-02-03T13:00:00.000Z	pestil	K-Rich	or the directory where the "Screenshot" and "Log out" options are?
2005-02-03T13:00:00.000Z	K-Rich	pestil	good question, i always use nautilus... but i think it's a file under ~/.gnome
2005-02-03T13:00:00.000Z	pestil	K-Rich	tausend thanx!!! You just saved a humand being!!!!
2005-02-03T13:02:00.000Z	pestil	K-Rich	bye
