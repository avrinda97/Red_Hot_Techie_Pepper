2010-06-10T00:47:00.000Z	no-name_		I can't change the permissions for these files on my usb drive. I can change them if i copy them to my hard drive but when i copy them back they go back to "Allow executing this file as a program"
2010-06-10T00:47:00.000Z	no-name_		I can't remember if its FAT or NTFS
2010-06-10T00:48:00.000Z	kjele	no-name_	what fs you use on the usb drive?
2010-06-10T00:48:00.000Z	no-name_		ok
2010-06-10T00:49:00.000Z	no-name_		FAT16
2010-06-10T00:49:00.000Z	kjele	no-name_	FAT does not have permissions. Writing to NTFS is a bit more complicated.
2010-06-10T00:50:00.000Z	no-name_	kjele	 what do you mean by more complicated?
2010-06-10T00:51:00.000Z	kjele	no-name_	The fs is not open and MS has a lot of hidden api.
2010-06-10T00:53:00.000Z	no-name_	kjele	Application Programming Interface?
2010-06-10T00:54:00.000Z	kjele	no-name_	yes.
2010-06-10T00:54:00.000Z	no-name_	kjele	so does NTFS allow permissions?
2010-06-10T00:55:00.000Z	kjele	no-name_	It does
2010-06-10T00:55:00.000Z	no-name_		cool. i would just make it ext2 but i use linux and windows
2010-06-10T00:55:00.000Z	no-name_		thanks kjele
2010-06-10T00:56:00.000Z	kjele	no-name_	Best to keep it as fat and then chmod if you need to
2010-06-10T00:57:00.000Z	no-name_	kjele	how do i remove executable with chmod?
2010-06-10T00:57:00.000Z	no-name_		its just the arguement i don't know
2010-06-10T00:57:00.000Z	no-name_		there needs to be something in between chmod and 'file'
2010-06-10T00:58:00.000Z	kjele		!chmod | no-name_
2010-06-10T00:58:00.000Z	no-name_		:)
2010-06-10T00:59:00.000Z	kjele	no-name_	Even if you remove executable you can still execute the file.
