2010-03-09T06:08:00.000Z	h00k	ilovethislinuxst	it's another program to IRC on, it's dedicate to IRC and doesn't do other messengers, too
2010-03-09T06:15:00.000Z	h00k	ilovethislinuxst	I'm going to have ubottu send you a message, it'll tell you how to enable DVD playback
2010-03-09T06:32:00.000Z	h00k	ilovethislinuxst	I had already gave you a link that has instructions as to how to fix that.
2010-03-09T06:37:00.000Z	h00k	ilovethislinuxst	that 'this and that' was instructions you click on, read, and preform and it will get your DVD to play.  You'll have to read it, it walks you straight through it./
2010-03-09T06:38:00.000Z	h00k	ilovethislinuxst	The bot will give you information, again. It also sent you a pm with the information.
2010-03-09T06:40:00.000Z	h00k	ilovethislinuxst	...You have to listen to what we're saying.
2010-03-09T06:41:00.000Z	h00k	ilovethislinuxst	You have to install extra packages to get a DVD to play. I have given you the links plenty of times, you have to read them and do what they say.
2010-03-09T06:41:00.000Z	h00k	ilovethislinuxst	They explain what to do. In Detail. With Pictures.
2010-03-09T06:42:00.000Z	h00k	ilovethislinuxst	they all give you information about that, use the first one for the instructions
2010-03-09T06:50:00.000Z	h00k	ilovethislinuxst	that's safe
2010-03-09T07:00:00.000Z	h00k	ilovethislinuxst	I'm glad you got it :)
