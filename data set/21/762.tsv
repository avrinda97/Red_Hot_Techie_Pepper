2011-11-12T05:58:00.000Z	L1nuxRules		regarding messages on the server but might also be worth looking on the desktop
2011-11-12T06:00:00.000Z	L1nuxRules		reboots dont fix issues on Linux
2011-11-12T06:00:00.000Z	L1nuxRules		you restart services on Linux not the box
2011-11-12T06:00:00.000Z	apwbdjp	L1nuxRules	the sshd is working fine with him. he can send commands. bash is the only thing that doesn't give him a prompt.
2011-11-12T06:02:00.000Z	apwbdjp	L1nuxRules	he meant dash doesn't give him a prompt either
2011-11-12T06:10:00.000Z	apwbdjp	L1nuxRules	indeed, it has.
2011-11-12T06:26:00.000Z	apwbdjp	L1nuxRules	he can throw single commands and get output via ssh, so I believe it is
2011-11-12T06:42:00.000Z	apwbdjp	L1nuxRules	they're scripts, actually.
2011-11-12T06:44:00.000Z	apwbdjp	L1nuxRules	you realise he was talking about what you use to stop, start and restart sshd? not the sshd itself.
2011-11-12T06:45:00.000Z	apwbdjp	L1nuxRules	which aren't deamons.
2011-11-12T06:48:00.000Z	apwbdjp	L1nuxRules	you were right about being stonned..
2011-11-12T06:49:00.000Z	apwbdjp	L1nuxRules	we do, you just didn't seem to.. Anyway this isn't going anywhere anymore.
2011-11-12T06:50:00.000Z	apwbdjp	L1nuxRules	says the guyswho just said ssh is a client and a server at the same time.
2011-11-12T07:17:00.000Z	apwbdjp	L1nuxRules	we completely understand, you are very bored and have really nothing else to do. Go have some sleep, better for you.
2011-11-13T07:50:00.000Z	apwbdjp	L1nuxRules	who cares about people's intention? You're volunteering to help people with using an OS whose entire idea is based on free information.
2011-11-13T07:51:00.000Z	apwbdjp	L1nuxRules	everyone can know anything. If we start restricting information, let's be Windows, and hide our source codes so that people don't know our security breaches.
2011-11-13T07:53:00.000Z	apwbdjp	L1nuxRules	this'll be my last off-topic comment. I like you L1nuxRules, I've been watching you help people for while now, and you're good really. No need to answer me.
2011-11-13T08:19:00.000Z	apwbdjp	L1nuxRules	he's far away from there yet, he's still trying to install
2011-11-13T08:41:00.000Z	apwbdjp	L1nuxRules	take it literal. Package managers manage packages. Which the rpm executable does pretty much.
2011-11-13T08:47:00.000Z	apwbdjp	L1nuxRules	the metaphore given before was right. yum is to rpm what apt is to dpkg.
2011-11-13T09:00:00.000Z	apwbdjp	L1nuxRules	you can force anything in a machine's throat, a good manager will tell you not to, but you still can.
