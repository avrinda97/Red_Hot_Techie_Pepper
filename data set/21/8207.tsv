2008-12-14T08:23:00.000Z	ray_		I am new to Ubuntu, just loaded it 3 days ago
2008-12-14T08:23:00.000Z	ray_		thanks
2008-12-14T08:24:00.000Z	ray_		I am having some issues getting everything to work right now, but impressed with it so far
2008-12-14T08:25:00.000Z	ray_		trying to find good places to find out info on using Ubuntu
2008-12-14T08:25:00.000Z	ray_		I believe its 8.10
2008-12-14T08:26:00.000Z	ray_		well, can't get Wine to work
2008-12-14T08:26:00.000Z	ray_		it seems when I try to use it, it logs me out
2008-12-14T08:27:00.000Z	ray_		well, just when I try to open it to configure it or open anything with Wine
2008-12-14T08:27:00.000Z	ray_		also can't get one of my HP printers to work with it eiether
2008-12-14T08:28:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	ray_	wine logs you out of ubuntu?
2008-12-14T08:31:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	ray_	wubi is the default way for running ubuntu from within windows
2008-12-14T08:33:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	ray_	it should still work, but what is it logging you out of? Is it completely closing down Ubuntu, but leaves you in windows?
2008-12-14T08:36:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	ray_	so at what point does wine log you out?
2008-12-14T08:37:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	ray_	everytime you run wine?
2008-12-14T08:38:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	ray_	do you have the correct video driver?
2008-12-14T08:39:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	ray_	please don't message privately without asking
2008-12-14T08:40:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	ray_	you might need to enable a video driver, such as an nvidia restricted driver, if you are using nvidia
2008-12-14T08:45:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	ray_	it could be a problem with your video driver then
2008-12-14T08:46:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	ray_	it's the video drivers in linux that you might need to look at
2008-12-14T08:49:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	ray_	do you have an nvidia card?
2008-12-14T08:50:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	ray_	you might want to try running wine from the live cd on that computer and see what happens
