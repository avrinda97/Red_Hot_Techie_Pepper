2008-05-07T05:08:00.000Z	gaten		everytime i restart my computer, X goes into "low res mode", where the resolution is 648x480 and cannot be changed, and my nVidia Server Settings seems to think i don't have an nvidia driver installed. im using the binary drivers from nvidias sight, and i have to reinstall them after each reboot. any suggestions?
2008-05-07T05:09:00.000Z	starcannon	gaten	add "nvidia" without the quotes to your /etc/modules list
2008-05-07T05:10:00.000Z	gaten	starcannon	that sounds reasonable, ill try that thanks
2008-05-07T05:11:00.000Z	starcannon	gaten	any time, I use Nvidia cards alot, its a part of their driver install that has never been fixed, it should add it there by default I think, but it don't
2008-05-07T05:12:00.000Z	gaten	starcannon	how annoying. did the ubuntu supported drivers work for you at all? i get no picture just sound on X boot, they have never worked for me (feisty, gusty or hardy)
2008-05-07T05:13:00.000Z	starcannon	gaten	the ubuntu restricted drivers worked for me in gutsy, but I updated them anyway, I like to have the latest that nvidia has to offer, so I end up just killing the default ones an manually installing the NVIDIA*.run ones from their site
2008-05-07T05:13:00.000Z	gaten	starcannon	ahh k
2008-05-07T05:14:00.000Z	starcannon	gaten	I never even bothered with the default ones in hardy, just went straight to nvidia.com and grabbed them. I have done so many nvidia card installs it only takes me 10 minutes now, including downloading the build essentials package
2008-05-07T05:15:00.000Z	gaten	starcannon	i prefer nvidia's drivers, but it annoys me that the default ubuntu ones don't work for me
2008-05-07T05:16:00.000Z	starcannon	gaten	in hardy I had read on the forums that unchecking them in the restricted driver manager then rechecking them, then rebooting will get them going, but I could download and install the latest ones in about the same amount of time ;P
2008-05-07T05:17:00.000Z	starcannon	gaten	I put together a guide in a text file if you want it. its to big to post here it would flood, but i can mail it or post it in a private channel real quick
2008-05-07T05:17:00.000Z	gaten	starcannon	have at it
2008-05-07T05:20:00.000Z	starcannon	gaten	heres the guide http://pastebin.com/f4d1facb2
2008-05-07T05:21:00.000Z	gaten	starcannon	 thanks
2008-05-07T05:21:00.000Z	starcannon	gaten	don't skip steps even if you think you've already done them in the past, follow it completely and you'll be rewarded with an Nvidia splash screen and full direct rendering support
2008-05-07T05:21:00.000Z	starcannon	gaten	any time
2008-05-07T05:46:00.000Z	starcannon	gaten	how did the guide work out for you?

2008-05-07T06:07:00.000Z	gaten	starcannon	 yea
2008-05-07T06:08:00.000Z	starcannon	gaten	did that guide straighten things up for you?
2008-05-07T06:08:00.000Z	gaten	starcannon	 oh gotta restart and check. the only thing i didnt do that you pointed out was with the modules. let me restart and see
