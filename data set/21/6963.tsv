2007-03-19T07:05:00.000Z	TheInfinity		does anybody know why a keyboard does not work in grub, in bios it works, with ubuntu it also works - and when i plug in another usb keyboard it works in grub?
2007-03-19T07:05:00.000Z	TheInfinity		so why does this special USB keyboard not work in grub / DOS CD ?
2007-03-19T07:07:00.000Z	void^	TheInfinity	enable usb legacy device emulation in your bios.
2007-03-19T07:07:00.000Z	TheInfinity		is enabled
2007-03-19T07:07:00.000Z	TheInfinity		and it works with my own keyboard
2007-03-19T07:07:00.000Z	void^	TheInfinity	blame the keyboard/bios then
2007-03-19T07:07:00.000Z	TheInfinity		but with this other (and logitech OEM) keyboard it does not work
2007-03-19T07:07:00.000Z	TheInfinity		*a - not and
2007-03-19T07:08:00.000Z	TheInfinity	void^	then i have the next problem - the bios upgrade requies windows or a 1,4MB disc ;)
2007-03-19T07:08:00.000Z	void^	TheInfinity	you can usually get away with burning those disk images as bootcds
2007-03-19T07:09:00.000Z	TheInfinity	void^	i tried this ;)
2007-03-19T07:11:00.000Z	TheInfinity		its a new bios type, i had it in 2 pcs - it forces the computer to load data from a:
2007-03-19T07:11:00.000Z	TheInfinity		which is not the cd drive
2007-03-19T07:11:00.000Z	void^		well, a bootcd's floppy emulation will show up as a: in dos
2007-03-19T07:12:00.000Z	TheInfinity		the funny thing is: on an older computer (pentium 1 ghz) the keyboard works ... just on an 1/2 year old MSI board and a 2 month old asrock board iit does not work ...
2007-03-19T07:12:00.000Z	void^		but if it uses direct hardware access that probably won't help
2007-03-19T07:12:00.000Z	TheInfinity		i use a win ME cd for dos ... it emulates some data in a:/
2007-03-19T07:12:00.000Z	TheInfinity		but not the files for the bios
2007-03-19T07:13:00.000Z	TheInfinity		MrBrizzio: chown
2007-03-19T07:13:00.000Z	void^		well, you can create a bootcd using any downloaded bootable floppy image with your bios update in it
2007-03-19T07:14:00.000Z	TheInfinity	void^	where to get it?
