2007-01-13T13:36:00.000Z	Dave-Ubuntu	mnoir	- no - one has NTFS data - that can be lost and the other was part of a RAID - i wanna wipe the lot and just use them exclusively on UBUNTU as storage
2007-01-13T13:37:00.000Z	mnoir	Dave-Ubuntu	oh - I see - now i understand mike-e's comments :)  i suggest you google 'ubuntu new disk'  there are a number of steps i think you need
