2008-03-22T09:30:00.000Z	unop	LimCore	what's bad about ubuntu's security?
2008-03-22T09:33:00.000Z	unop	LimCore	that depends if the installer chooses to run the server when it completes -- most ubuntu package installers do that
2008-07-10T04:51:00.000Z	unop	LimCore	yes -- as you can see, we are all on irc being on ubuntu :)
2008-07-10T04:57:00.000Z	unop	LimCore	does a static setup work fine?
2008-07-10T04:57:00.000Z	LimCore	unop	I dont think this modem would allow it
2008-07-10T04:57:00.000Z	LimCore	unop	ISP's modem
2008-07-10T04:57:00.000Z	unop	LimCore	errm, it ought to
2008-07-10T04:58:00.000Z	unop	LimCore	DHCP or not, what matters to the modem is that you have an IP address in the right network
2008-07-10T04:58:00.000Z	unop	LimCore	yes
2008-07-10T04:58:00.000Z	unop	LimCore	i'm not sure at the top of my head -- i always use the manpage
2008-08-10T23:05:00.000Z	LimCore	unop	some bugs are reported and confirmed for months or years btw
2008-08-11T03:50:00.000Z	unop	LimCore	do you have the deb-src repos enabled .. especially universe
2008-08-11T03:54:00.000Z	LimCore	unop	I do: deb-src http://pl.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ hardy restricted main multiverse
2008-08-11T03:55:00.000Z	LimCore	unop	I wonder is it the - in name which confuses it
2008-08-11T03:56:00.000Z	unop	LimCore	that seems fine
2008-08-11T03:56:00.000Z	unop	LimCore	 can you get the source for p7zip ?
2008-08-11T03:56:00.000Z	LimCore	unop	there is no such package
2008-08-11T03:57:00.000Z	LimCore	unop	p7zip-full exists
2008-08-11T03:58:00.000Z	unop	LimCore	hmm
2008-08-11T03:59:00.000Z	unop	LimCore	are you sure you got universe selected ?  i can't see it on that line there
2008-09-22T05:13:00.000Z	unop	LimCore	please take this seriously - he might just follow your instructions and be distraught later
