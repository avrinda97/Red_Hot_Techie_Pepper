2008-11-25T20:03:00.000Z	LjL		i tend to use apt-get to install and aptitude to search, but that's me
2008-11-25T20:03:00.000Z	histo	LjL	wouldn't you use apt-cache for searching?
2008-11-25T20:04:00.000Z	LjL	histo	well to be honest, yes i do in most circumstance. but there are cases when aptitude just lets you search much more complicated things.
2009-04-11T06:54:00.000Z	LjL	histo	root.
2009-04-11T06:54:00.000Z	LjL	histo	there is, but by default, at least on Hardy, /var/www is owned by root.
2009-04-11T06:54:00.000Z	histo	LjL	thats so annoying to new users something that needs to be addressed.
2009-04-11T06:55:00.000Z	histo	LjL	there should be a www group or www-data group by default no?
2009-04-11T06:55:00.000Z	histo	LjL	that atleast the admin group has access to without pass
2009-04-11T06:55:00.000Z	LjL	histo	there *is* a www-data group.
2009-04-11T06:55:00.000Z	LjL	histo	it's just not the owner of /var/www
2009-04-21T04:15:00.000Z	LjL	histo	sebsebseb: maybe you could argue in private?
2009-11-23T06:21:00.000Z	histo	LjL	irssi is an awesome irc client
2009-11-23T06:21:00.000Z	LjL	histo	uhm, maybe, but how is that relevant?
2009-11-23T06:22:00.000Z	histo	LjL	sry wrong person
2010-05-29T18:05:00.000Z	histo	LjL	do you know where I can find info on the partner repo?
2010-05-29T18:07:00.000Z	histo	LjL	nvm
2010-11-18T21:31:00.000Z	histo	LjL	yeah I think pt
2010-11-18T21:31:00.000Z	LjL	histo	yeah, the "o" gives it away but i overlooked that initially :P
2011-05-27T03:19:00.000Z	LjL	histo	actually though, the site isn't yet updated for Natty :(
