2005-06-30T13:36:00.000Z	coreyo		how do you access administration in cups (localhost:631) ?  the printer-manager doesn't let me name/rename or alter any printers, and logging in as root doesn't seem to be working
2005-06-30T13:37:00.000Z	Seveas	coreyo	sudo adduser cupsys shadow
2005-06-30T13:42:00.000Z	coreyo	Seveas	what does the shadow group do?
2005-06-30T13:42:00.000Z	Seveas	coreyo	the shadow group can read the encrypted passwords, so it can let you login to the web interface
2005-06-30T14:04:00.000Z	Seveas	coreyo	yes, as if the hard disk is spinning up
2005-06-30T14:04:00.000Z	coreyo	Seveas	any ideas?
2005-06-30T14:04:00.000Z	coreyo	Seveas	exactly... and if you're typing several letters are either dropped or repeated
2005-06-30T14:05:00.000Z	Seveas	coreyo	no not that, they just take some time to 'arrive' on the screen
2005-06-30T14:05:00.000Z	coreyo	Seveas	mine actually get dropped, depending on how furiously I'm typing...   this problem seems to be ubuntu specific...
2005-06-30T14:06:00.000Z	Seveas	coreyo	try fiddling with the power management setting to prevent the hard drive from spinning down
2005-06-30T14:08:00.000Z	coreyo	Seveas	I seem to remember someone saying that the powernowd daemon was causing problems... what else should I check?
2005-06-30T14:14:00.000Z	coreyo	Seveas	 /etc/init.d/powernowd stop seems to have corrected the problem.   Does powernow actually control the disk, or would that just be my processor speed changing ?
2005-08-01T13:28:00.000Z	Seveas	coreyo	it can, use 'rescue' as boot option
2005-08-01T13:29:00.000Z	coreyo	Seveas	I tried that, but it keeps telling me that it cannot mount /dev/sda6 as the root partition and panics
2005-08-01T13:29:00.000Z	Seveas	coreyo	hmm, you might need to use a live cd then
2005-08-01T13:29:00.000Z	coreyo	Seveas	if I use the live cd, am I supposed to mount everything and chroot into it?
2005-08-01T13:31:00.000Z	coreyo	Seveas	what are grub commands for having grub install itself onto a given partition?
2005-08-01T13:31:00.000Z	Seveas	coreyo	read that wikipage
2005-08-01T13:32:00.000Z	coreyo	Seveas	I'm looking for it now, what's it titled?
2005-08-01T13:33:00.000Z	Seveas	coreyo	http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecoverinUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
2005-08-01T13:35:00.000Z	coreyo	Seveas	thanks.  Sorry... I'm a lilo guy until recently
