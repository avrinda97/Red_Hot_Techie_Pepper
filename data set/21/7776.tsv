2006-11-02T14:42:00.000Z	Bonez56		hi all, i have an ibm 300 series server. i have installed ubuntu and brought up eth0, assigned it an IP address etc, however, it when I try to ping another machine on the LAN it says: Reply from "insert IP of the ubuntu server - ie, itself" - Destination Host Unreachable. Can anyone help?
2006-11-02T14:42:00.000Z	crass	Bonez56	that usually means that you don't have the netmask correct (ie you're on a different ip network)
2006-11-02T14:43:00.000Z	Bonez56	crass	yes the netmask is working. I have a /29 from my ISP (8 IP addresses) - yes dns is configured, the rest of the LAN is perfect
2006-11-02T14:43:00.000Z	Bonez56	crass	for me it's 255.255.255.248 for /29
2006-11-02T14:43:00.000Z	Bonez56	crass	it's all set up properly
2006-11-02T14:44:00.000Z	crass	Bonez56	next is routing, maybe you don't have  adefault route
2006-11-02T14:44:00.000Z	Bonez56	crass	how do I add a default route?
2006-11-02T14:44:00.000Z	crass	Bonez56	route add default gw <ip of gateway>
2006-11-02T14:45:00.000Z	Bonez56	crass	i just tried that, it still says host unreachable
2006-11-02T14:45:00.000Z	crass	Bonez56	can you ping your gateway?
2006-11-02T14:45:00.000Z	Bonez56	crass	no, that is the problem
2006-11-02T14:46:00.000Z	crass	Bonez56	what is the output of "route"
2006-11-02T14:46:00.000Z	Bonez56	crass	it outputs nothing
2006-11-02T14:47:00.000Z	crass	Bonez56	you have serious issues if it outputs _nothing_
2006-11-02T14:47:00.000Z	Bonez56	crass	it outputs the standard "Kernel IP routing tables blah blah" but there is actually no IP addresses or routes
2006-11-02T14:48:00.000Z	crass	Bonez56	and you did: route add default gw <i of gateway>?
2006-11-02T14:48:00.000Z	Bonez56	crass	yes i did, let me try again
2006-11-02T14:55:00.000Z	crass	Bonez56	do you have a local network? are you directly connected to you internet source?
2006-11-02T14:56:00.000Z	Bonez56	crass	i have a local network and an ADSL router that handles the subnet. I just rebooted and now I am getting results from "route" can I pm them to you?
2006-11-02T14:56:00.000Z	crass	Bonez56	yes
2006-11-02T15:00:00.000Z	crass	Bonez56	pm me the route output and the output of ifconfig
