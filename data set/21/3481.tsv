2009-01-01T08:48:00.000Z	csc_		is there a specific channel for livecd customization? (both ubuntu or  not ubuntu related)
2009-01-01T08:48:00.000Z	bazhang	csc_	this is for ubuntu, ##linux for other
2009-01-01T08:49:00.000Z	bazhang	csc_	try uck
2009-01-01T08:51:00.000Z	csc_	bazhang	actually i have an issue related to squashfs: i have done a   customized livecd, but it breaks after initramsfs. basically casper.log says it cannot mount the squashfs file as a loopback device because of an "invalid argument". it's interesting to know that i can mount it manually from the remastered os, but not from within busybox, as i said
2009-01-01T08:52:00.000Z	bazhang	csc_	why would you want squashfs
2009-01-01T08:53:00.000Z	bazhang	csc_	are you doing this manually or with one of the tools provided
2009-01-01T08:53:00.000Z	csc_	bazhang	because the fs is compressed
2009-01-01T08:53:00.000Z	csc_	bazhang	i am using remastersys
2009-01-01T08:54:00.000Z	bazhang	csc_	well using the uck I had zero problems, you may wish to repeat every five-ten minutes, and post on ubuntuforums while you wait for an answer
2009-01-01T08:54:00.000Z	csc_	bazhang	it worked at first: i installed 8.10, i customized my desktop, i remsterized it with remastersys. OK. then i installed back to hd, i modified the os again, i tried to remaster it again , but i encountered that problem: it cannot mount the squashfs
2009-01-01T08:55:00.000Z	csc_	bazhang	but can uck remaster the os on the cd with _all_ the changes?
2009-01-01T08:56:00.000Z	bazhang	csc_	best to do it all in one go, sounds like your second round of remastering is catching you out
2009-01-01T08:56:00.000Z	csc_	bazhang	basically i want to be able to remaster and install on a device **recursevely** without loosing the changes.. is it possible with uck ?
2009-01-01T08:57:00.000Z	bazhang	csc_	you basically want a persistent live cd?
2009-01-01T08:57:00.000Z	csc_	bazhang	yes, but why the second round is it different from the first one? basically the second time could not mount the squashfs , while the first time it could
2009-01-01T08:59:00.000Z	csc_	bazhang	not exactly. i do not want a persistent live cd..   i want a livecd that  can install itself on an hd (without persistent modifications, as the cd wirtes everything in memory). ok. FURTHERMORE i want to be able to remaster the hd and all its modification back to the a livecd again. remasterys could do that the first "round", but not the second, because of a damn mounting problem with squashfs
2009-01-01T09:08:00.000Z	csc_	bazhang	when you used uck to remaster your os, were you able to install the new livecd on an hd , as the original ubuntu?
2009-01-01T09:08:00.000Z	bazhang	csc_	well, if by original you mean heavily modified, then yes
2009-01-01T09:09:00.000Z	csc_	bazhang	have you also tried dru?
2009-01-01T09:09:00.000Z	bazhang	csc_	not yet no
2009-01-01T09:16:00.000Z	csc_	bazhang	last question. by reading on the uck webpage, it is not very clear what uck can do exactly: can it build a livecd which behaves as exact copy of my actual running os: that is, including scripts in /etc/ that i have made by myself, autologin with my actual user on X, my home dir, etc..
