2010-06-09T05:19:00.000Z	mechdave	boxbeatsy	It is not recommended to have a machine that allows root ssh... Massive security hole!!
2010-06-09T05:21:00.000Z	mechdave	boxbeatsy	you can actually sudo to root terminal if you are careful, note: this can destroy your system if you do the wrong thing... sudo su will give you a root terminal
2010-06-09T05:23:00.000Z	mechdave	boxbeatsy	so you ssh in as root and then su to non privileged user?
2010-06-09T05:24:00.000Z	mechdave	boxbeatsy	you may need to ssh in as non privileged user then sudo to root
2010-06-09T05:29:00.000Z	mechdave	boxbeatsy	what are you trying to install?
2010-06-09T05:29:00.000Z	boxbeatsy	mechdave	carl-m_ i'mt trying to install a proejct called TyphoonAE
2010-06-09T05:29:00.000Z	boxbeatsy	mechdave	carl-m_ it's to port GAE applications over to EC2
2010-06-09T05:32:00.000Z	mechdave	boxbeatsy	this is Google web apps server?
2010-06-09T05:32:00.000Z	boxbeatsy	mechdave	Google App Engine
2010-06-09T05:32:00.000Z	boxbeatsy	mechdave	carl-m_ doh, everything is much simpler when i'm in my user's home directoyr.  from before iw as working in /root
2010-06-09T05:33:00.000Z	mechdave	boxbeatsy	Ok you need to install this as super user from your home dir
2010-06-09T05:33:00.000Z	boxbeatsy	mechdave	ok, is my new user a super user if i added them in /etc/sudoers along with root?
2010-06-09T05:34:00.000Z	mechdave	boxbeatsy	so ssh in as normal user, unpack your sources and then use sudo in front of all commands to install
2010-06-09T05:34:00.000Z	boxbeatsy	mechdave	oops, i've started insatlling without using sudo in front, but its still letting me.  is that gonna be aproblem?
2010-06-09T05:34:00.000Z	mechdave	boxbeatsy	see this page for install --> http://code.google.com/p/typhoonae/wiki/GettingStarted?tm=6
2010-06-09T05:35:00.000Z	boxbeatsy	mechdave	ya i followed those pages and got it insatlled under root, but im getting an error because the server doesnt want to run as root
2010-06-09T05:35:00.000Z	mechdave	boxbeatsy	just means it may only be accessable to your user that you built it as or maybe it may even fail in install
2010-06-09T05:35:00.000Z	boxbeatsy	mechdave	so now im redoing it as a new user that i granted ALL privileges in /etc/sudoers.  does that sound right?
2010-06-09T05:35:00.000Z	mechdave	boxbeatsy	yeah
2010-06-09T05:35:00.000Z	mechdave	boxbeatsy	give it a go
2010-06-09T05:35:00.000Z	boxbeatsy	mechdave	ok thanks!
