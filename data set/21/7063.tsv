2008-04-08T20:00:00.000Z	SliMM		what other terminal special characters are there besides ^z and ^c?
2008-04-08T20:01:00.000Z	sipior	SliMM	ctrl-\, ctrl-q, ctrl-s
2008-04-08T20:01:00.000Z	SliMM	sipior	and what do they do?
2008-04-08T20:01:00.000Z	sipior	SliMM	flow control, job-killing
2008-04-08T20:02:00.000Z	SliMM	sipior	any list of such commands described somewhere?
2008-04-08T20:05:00.000Z	sipior	SliMM	try "stty -a"
2008-04-08T20:05:00.000Z	sipior	SliMM	look under "cchars"
2008-04-08T20:14:00.000Z	sipior	SliMM	sends an interrupt signal to the foreground process
2008-04-08T20:15:00.000Z	SliMM	sipior	how do i switch between processes?
2008-04-08T20:15:00.000Z	sipior	SliMM	if you have multiple processes running on a terminal, try "jobs"
2008-04-08T20:37:00.000Z	SliMM	sipior	so, how do i return to a job?
2008-04-08T20:37:00.000Z	SliMM	sipior	and how do i make a job run in background?
2008-04-08T20:37:00.000Z	sipior	SliMM	if you've started a task, you can background it by hitting ctrl-z, and then "bg"
2008-04-08T20:38:00.000Z	SliMM	sipior	ctrl+z stops the task
2008-04-08T20:38:00.000Z	sipior	SliMM	if you want that task to run in the background to begin with, just invoke it with an ampersand at the end
2008-04-08T20:39:00.000Z	SliMM	sipior	and if i just want to start a task, and then, after a while, leave it running and start another one, and then switch back?
2008-04-08T20:40:00.000Z	sipior	SliMM	ctrl-z, bg, start your other task, background it the same way, then use "jobs" to go between the two
2008-04-08T20:41:00.000Z	SliMM	sipior	ok, how do i use jobs, there is no man entry, and it just lists the jobs by default
2008-04-08T20:41:00.000Z	sipior	SliMM	"jobs" is part of the shell. try "man bash" for an incredible amount of detail
2008-04-08T20:43:00.000Z	SliMM	sipior	one more thing, how do i make a job stop outputting for a while, while it runs in the background?
2008-04-08T20:44:00.000Z	sipior	SliMM	if the job is trying to write to the terminal, it will halt automatically when you background it
