2009-12-19T14:54:00.000Z	hyperstream	burzki	damn, any chance of an example on how to do this ?
2009-12-19T14:54:00.000Z	burzki	hyperstream	also, i dont know what you're really trying to do, but you could try the lucid alpha.  i have it going on an older machine now just fine .. just an idea.  the new kernel may support the hardware drivers better
2009-12-19T14:55:00.000Z	hyperstream	burzki	whats wubi like ?
2009-12-19T14:56:00.000Z	burzki	hyperstream	wubi.  no personal experience.  works for some, not for others.  the word on this side is that a dual boot scenario is a much better option
2009-12-19T14:57:00.000Z	hyperstream	burzki	it looks like it may be my only options :(
2009-12-19T14:58:00.000Z	hyperstream	burzki	got a link please

2009-12-19T14:59:00.000Z	hyperstream	burzki	ty
2009-12-19T15:06:00.000Z	burzki	hyperstream	for the boot commands.  from the boot menu, you should be able to get to a boot prompt from there.  then just put in whichever you think may apply.
