2007-09-27T08:00:00.000Z	broken		Does anyone know anything about snd-hda-intel?
2007-09-27T08:00:00.000Z	nickrud	broken	what model computer do you have?
2007-09-27T08:02:00.000Z	nickrud	broken	alsa sometimes needs to be told what model your sound card is in.
2007-11-17T11:01:00.000Z	nickrud	broken	yes, or it's always Worked For Meâ„¢ anyway
2007-11-17T11:02:00.000Z	nickrud	broken	oh, I'm aware of that, why do you think I use debianized stuff ;)
2007-11-17T11:03:00.000Z	broken	nickrud	heh, I'm actually using 2 gentoo systems I'm just here to help out lol..
2007-11-17T11:05:00.000Z	broken	nickrud	just built myself a computer, running ubuntu studio on that, need it for audio editing. The family computer I just put OpenSUSE on it but its misbehaving I will put ubuntu on that computers. Its just so nice and easy :)
2007-11-17T11:05:00.000Z	nickrud	broken	yes, I do like debian, but ubuntu has made real strides in configuration, so I don't have to think about it
2007-11-17T11:06:00.000Z	broken	nickrud	indeed, it should be like that :) Only thing that really needs to be figured out is DirectX emulation imo.
2007-11-17T23:33:00.000Z	nickrud	broken	one nice thing about grub, kernels can live anywhere, they don't need to be together
2007-11-17T23:33:00.000Z	broken	nickrud	yes i know that, its just so I can keep track of em ;)
2007-11-17T23:34:00.000Z	nickrud	broken	yeah, I like having the kernel hooked up with the distro it uses
2007-12-04T09:58:00.000Z	nickrud	broken	you'd be better off running xp in a virtual machine, really
2007-12-04T09:58:00.000Z	broken	nickrud	well..
2007-12-04T09:59:00.000Z	nickrud	broken	yeah, I added an extra gig just for that reason
2007-12-04T10:00:00.000Z	broken	nickrud	how much do you have?
2007-12-04T10:00:00.000Z	nickrud	broken	2g
2007-12-04T10:00:00.000Z	broken	nickrud	 do you think it will be good enough to use with vmware/xp photoshop?
2007-12-04T10:01:00.000Z	nickrud	broken	I do it on a 1.6ghz dual athlon, runs well enough for my limited uses
