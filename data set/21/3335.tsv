2009-07-21T16:05:00.000Z	jhujhiti	gartral	you can't chmod it? i assume you tried that and i missed it
2009-07-21T16:06:00.000Z	jhujhiti	gartral	read-only filesystem?
2009-07-21T16:06:00.000Z	gartral	jhujhiti	again, sudo has NO permissions for the file.... it might as well be buyied 6 feet under
2009-07-21T16:06:00.000Z	gartral	jhujhiti	impossible... i have no read perms..
2009-07-21T16:07:00.000Z	jhujhiti	gartral	good point
2009-07-21T16:07:00.000Z	jhujhiti	gartral	i wonder if that could happen to a corrupted inode
2009-07-21T16:08:00.000Z	jhujhiti	gartral	fsck it lately? =)
2009-07-21T16:08:00.000Z	gartral	jhujhiti	the FIRST thing i did after i recovered BIOS was run a full file system check
2009-07-21T16:09:00.000Z	jhujhiti	gartral	so is it just /etc/X11/xorg.conf as far as you can tell? can you -- say -- touch /etc/X11?
2009-07-21T16:10:00.000Z	gartral	jhujhiti	i can both touch the dir and ls it, but it seems JUST ./xorg.conf has perms ---
2009-07-21T16:10:00.000Z	jhujhiti	gartral	it's *got* to be inode weirdness
2009-07-21T16:11:00.000Z	gartral	jhujhiti	but i kept ext3 because it was stable ;_;
2009-07-21T16:12:00.000Z	jhujhiti	gartral	if i knew more about the on-disk structure, i'd tell you how to fix it =(
2009-07-21T16:13:00.000Z	gartral	jhujhiti	well. i fixed itt... i touched /etc/X11/xorg.conf and it gave me the 700 ex tag back.. and i did it without sudo... that is very VERY odd
2009-07-21T16:14:00.000Z	jhujhiti	gartral	find / -exec head -c 1 \{\} \; 1>/dev/null # find other files like that, i guess
2009-07-21T16:16:00.000Z	jhujhiti	gartral	contgratulations on proving to me that RAID is not an acceptable safety measure
2009-07-21T16:16:00.000Z	gartral	jhujhiti	huh.. no other file with that strange perm structure...
2009-07-21T16:17:00.000Z	gartral	jhujhiti	weeell.. i dont have a raid...
2009-07-21T16:17:00.000Z	jhujhiti	gartral	but it was a filesystem bug anyway ;p
2009-07-21T16:21:00.000Z	jhujhiti	gartral	what does the filesystem have anything to do with it?
2009-07-21T16:36:00.000Z	jhujhiti	gartral	i would never have guessed nautilus. and that's embarassing, because i should have
