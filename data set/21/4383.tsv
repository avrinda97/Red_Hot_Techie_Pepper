2008-05-06T02:17:00.000Z	fluidd		When i use compiz to flip through my desktops - I only have 2.  How can I add additional desktops?
2008-05-06T02:18:00.000Z	ramukmar	fluidd	right click on the workspace switcher->properties
2008-05-06T02:18:00.000Z	ramukmar	fluidd	preferences rather
2008-05-06T02:24:00.000Z	ramukmar	fluidd	so hsize 4 and vsize 1 is the cube
2008-05-06T02:20:00.000Z	ramukmar	fluidd	you could change it via gconf, or compizconfig-settings manager i suppose
2008-05-06T02:20:00.000Z	fluidd	ramukmar	I'll check the settings.
2008-05-06T02:21:00.000Z	fluidd	ramukmar	where exactly is it at in the compiz settings.. do u remember?  dont worry about it if u dont remember off the top of ur head.
2008-05-06T02:21:00.000Z	ramukmar	fluidd	should be in /apps/compiz/screen0
2008-05-06T02:22:00.000Z	ramukmar	fluidd	you'll want to change hsize and vsize, that's in gconf-editor btw...not in compiz settings
2008-05-06T02:23:00.000Z	fluidd	ramukmar	 change them to what?
2008-05-06T02:23:00.000Z	ramukmar	fluidd	i can't recall exactly where in compizconfig now
2008-05-06T02:23:00.000Z	ramukmar	fluidd	hsize is the number of columns basically, and vsize the number of rows
2008-05-06T02:23:00.000Z	ramukmar	fluidd	in your workspace switcher
2008-05-06T02:24:00.000Z	fluidd	ramukmar	 I see what you're taking about.  I changed that with workspace switcher.
2008-05-06T02:24:00.000Z	ramukmar	fluidd	cool
2008-05-06T02:25:00.000Z	fluidd	ramukmar	what's the setting for adding 2 additional desktops, though?
2008-05-06T02:25:00.000Z	ramukmar	fluidd	increasing hsize by 2 should work
2008-05-06T02:26:00.000Z	ramukmar	fluidd	bump. I just tried it here, worked for me
2008-05-06T02:26:00.000Z	ramukmar	fluidd	no need to restart x...hmm
2008-05-06T02:27:00.000Z	ramukmar	fluidd	compizconfig-settings-manager
2008-05-06T02:28:00.000Z	ramukmar	fluidd	i'm not sure where the settings are in there, maybe someone else remember?
