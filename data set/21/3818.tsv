2010-03-17T05:41:00.000Z	penguinv		Ubuntu 9.10 keeps crashing - not on startup. Only after a while. But 3x today. I have not been able to figure out how to report it.. I have copied a few logs and the ls to /var/logs in the right place. I've spent a long time going through this. (AMD, old with agp-pci) certainly I've done flash in youtube. Once it crashed while playing.  === HAPPENS WHEN: eremite, Losha. -- this is after running a long time.  EXCEPT it has happened 3x today. I have logs. I cant

The recovery (alt+sysrq + reisum does nothing). The logs are really big. Launchpad reports nothing similar and is daunting.
2010-03-17T05:42:00.000Z	penguinv		checking on memtest on my machine.
2010-03-17T05:43:00.000Z	DasEi	penguinv	what does crash mean ? inresponsive ? shutdown ?
2010-03-17T05:47:00.000Z	DasEi	penguinv	I see, can have different reasons;  easiest is to check basic hardware first, 1) memtest 2) hdisk 3) stresstest on chipset/cpu  4)disk not full 5) enough ram ,  next is syslog and messages, best to note the clock when freezing occurs , so can look up there, I'll explain more..
2010-03-17T05:48:00.000Z	DasEi	penguinv	which version are you using ? fresh karmic installl ?
2010-03-17T05:50:00.000Z	DasEi	penguinv	so you're on lucid then ? still not released.. support in ubuntu+1
2010-03-17T05:51:00.000Z	DasEi	penguinv	df -h in terminal tells you
2010-03-17T05:52:00.000Z	DasEi	penguinv	you said you had 9.10 and dist-upgraded it  (that was karmic) , so no it's lucid ;; can check out :
2010-03-17T05:53:00.000Z	DasEi	penguinv	so fine then, you run karmic
2010-03-17T05:53:00.000Z	DasEi	penguinv	so df -h to check for diskspace
2010-03-17T05:54:00.000Z	DasEi	penguinv	not much, but no reason to cripple (free some space, before you run in probs)
2010-03-17T05:55:00.000Z	DasEi	penguinv	system specs ?
