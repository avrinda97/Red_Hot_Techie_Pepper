2007-10-01T14:28:00.000Z	cyrano		YUP
2007-10-01T14:28:00.000Z	cyrano		what do i name a script by the way? . default .script???
2007-10-01T14:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	cyrano	*.sh if it's a shell script
2007-11-16T01:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	cyrano	in recovery mode try 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg' and choose sensible options for your hardware...
2007-11-16T01:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	cyrano	then use 'sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start' to test changes
2007-11-16T01:55:00.000Z	cyrano	erUSUL	what do you mean by sensible options?
2007-11-16T01:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	cyrano	well you have an ati choose the ati or vesa driver and you know the size of your lcd (i for sure don't know)
2007-11-16T01:57:00.000Z	cyrano	erUSUL	How do i know if i should choose ATI or VEsa driver?
2007-11-16T01:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	cyrano	try ati first if that doesn't work go for vesa
2007-11-16T02:04:00.000Z	cyrano	erUSUL	The configuring exits after i have chosen driver and video modes... i thought there would be more options. Also neither ATI or VESA works
2007-11-16T02:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	cyrano	try this instead 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'
2007-11-16T02:05:00.000Z	cyrano	erUSUL	Autodetect?
2007-11-16T02:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	cyrano	that's without autodetect iirc
2007-11-16T02:07:00.000Z	cyrano	erUSUL	I'm really unsure of the next steps. Are there any howtos on this in the forums?
2007-11-16T02:11:00.000Z	cyrano	erUSUL	I don't understand... the live cd did work perfectly. But not after install... this has happened before!
2007-11-16T02:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	cyrano	neither do I :S sorry of not being of much help
2007-11-16T02:31:00.000Z	cyrano	erUSUL	I made it to loginto gdm. thanks for the help. But now i think i've done a lot of random settings on the x-driver. is there a way to check this?
2007-11-16T02:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	cyrano	check what?
2007-11-30T21:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	cyrano	lsusb
