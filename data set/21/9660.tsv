2006-05-15T13:13:00.000Z	paradizelost		i used to have to tunnel RDP to get into secure networks through 3 hops
2006-05-15T13:14:00.000Z	paradizelost		there's a difference between tunneling, and changing the F*ing port it runs on
2006-05-15T13:15:00.000Z	paradizelost		he's talking about running his SSH server on port 21 instead of port 22, not tunneling the SSH traffic through an FTP connection
2006-05-15T13:15:00.000Z	paradizelost		the port has nothing to do w/ how the data is encapsulated
2006-05-15T13:16:00.000Z	paradizelost		just like running a web server on port 80 or port 8080 doesn't make the traffic secured at all
2006-05-15T13:16:00.000Z	Seveas	paradizelost	well, if "security through obscurity" counts... 
2006-05-15T13:17:00.000Z	paradizelost	Seveas	that would be running my http server on port 53421
2006-05-15T13:18:00.000Z	Seveas	paradizelost	linus is a fool
2006-05-15T13:19:00.000Z	paradizelost	Seveas	i do hope that was sarcastic....
2006-05-15T13:19:00.000Z	paradizelost	Seveas	considering the system you are talking about here would be much different
2006-05-15T13:38:00.000Z	Seveas	paradizelost	nonsense
2006-05-18T16:24:00.000Z	paradizelost	Seveas	you here?
2006-05-18T16:25:00.000Z	paradizelost	Seveas	how would one add a link to http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/dapper/flight-7/  in the info in !dapper?
2006-05-18T16:26:00.000Z	Seveas	paradizelost	one wouldn't. The factoid is long already
2006-05-18T16:26:00.000Z	paradizelost	Seveas	it's a pain to always have to tell people where they can get the cd....
2006-05-27T13:29:00.000Z	paradizelost	Seveas	ping
