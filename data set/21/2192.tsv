2009-12-19T05:07:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A		with other OS it is problematic to use 4 GB in 32-bit
2009-12-19T05:08:00.000Z	dragon	PrototypeX29A	An OS can handle about 3GiB without PAE, and a lot more with PAE.
2009-12-19T08:03:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	dragon	if I do it in one line irc will swallow it
2009-12-19T08:04:00.000Z	dragon	PrototypeX29A	I haven't heard that one before. IRC swallows lines?
2009-12-19T08:04:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	dragon	guess there is a maximum length
2009-12-19T08:04:00.000Z	dragon	PrototypeX29A	it's hard to follow what you're saying because of the disconnected messages. Try typing longer.
2009-12-19T08:06:00.000Z	dragon	PrototypeX29A	It doesn't change settings that way.
2010-02-02T04:06:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	dragon	just out of curiosity, why would you want to do that?
2010-02-02T04:06:00.000Z	dragon	PrototypeX29A	I want to have a local user, and a NIS user on this network, without messing access to files.
2010-02-02T04:07:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	dragon	sounds to me like an evil hack, that is going to come back to you and intercourse you in the behind
2010-02-02T04:08:00.000Z	dragon	PrototypeX29A	have you tried it?
2010-02-02T04:08:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	dragon	no, i would be to scared to do that
2010-02-02T04:09:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	dragon	an UID should be a unique identifier
2010-02-02T04:09:00.000Z	dragon	PrototypeX29A	should be, but linux doesn't explode when you try such things ;)
2010-02-02T04:10:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	dragon	but i strongly believe, that this is evil
2010-02-02T04:10:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	dragon	i am kind of religious
2010-02-02T04:10:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	dragon	you shouldn't mess up the sanity of your system
2010-02-02T04:11:00.000Z	dragon	PrototypeX29A	this ain't windows ;)
2010-02-02T04:12:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	dragon	you mean, we don't have a sane system in the first place?
2010-02-02T04:12:00.000Z	PrototypeX29A	dragon	it's getting off topic i guess
2010-02-02T04:13:00.000Z	dragon	PrototypeX29A	no, Linux works with UIDs. It doesn't care about usernames, based on my recent findings :)
