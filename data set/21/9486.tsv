2006-10-30T16:00:00.000Z	dk0r		How do I uninstall ubuntu from a partition on my powerbook? I cannot find any documentation :(
2006-10-30T16:00:00.000Z	Flannel	dk0r	just format it to whatever else you want
2006-10-30T16:00:00.000Z	dk0r	Flannel	How?
2006-10-30T16:00:00.000Z	dk0r	Flannel	Do I need the ubuntu live disc?
2006-10-30T16:00:00.000Z	Flannel	dk0r	whatever partition tools are on OSX, or you could use a liveCD, sure.
2006-10-30T16:01:00.000Z	dk0r	Flannel	The osx native partition tool is called disk utility, it does not recognize the ubuntu partition.
2006-10-30T16:01:00.000Z	dk0r	Flannel	So I guess I am forced to use the ubuntu live disc, right ?
2006-10-30T16:01:00.000Z	Flannel	dk0r	should still be able to partition it, even if it's an unknown filetype
2006-10-30T16:04:00.000Z	Flannel	dk0r	if disk manager can't do it, then boot up a liveCD, partition it to free space, or to something that disk man. can read, like... maybe fat or something
2006-11-15T08:35:00.000Z	Flannel	dk0r	use gksudo to start gedit
2006-11-15T08:35:00.000Z	dk0r	Flannel	what is gksudo ?
2006-11-15T08:35:00.000Z	dk0r	Flannel	gk?
2006-11-15T08:35:00.000Z	Flannel	dk0r	it'll run gedit with full perms
2006-11-15T08:36:00.000Z	dk0r	Flannel	does gedit not have permissions because the file is currentlly being used?
2006-11-15T08:36:00.000Z	Flannel	dk0r	no, gedit normally doesn't have permissions becuase you're opening it as your user, not the super user
2006-11-15T08:37:00.000Z	dk0r	Flannel	thanks.
2006-11-15T08:37:00.000Z	Flannel	dk0r	sort of
2006-11-15T09:52:00.000Z	Flannel	dk0r	aptitude is already installed
2006-11-15T09:52:00.000Z	dk0r	Flannel	Oh. So how do I use it? 'sudo aptitude samba' ?
2006-11-15T09:52:00.000Z	Flannel	dk0r	aptitude can be used like apt get, or in an interactive GUI
2006-11-15T09:53:00.000Z	dk0r	Flannel	So if I want Samba, I would enter 'sudo aptitude install samba' ?
