2009-09-15T09:17:00.000Z	cainram		Hello, all
2009-09-15T09:18:00.000Z	cainram		thanks, j
2009-09-15T09:19:00.000Z	cainram		I'm having a little trouble with my Gnome desktop... any gurus?
2009-09-15T09:19:00.000Z	DasEi	cainram	give us more details
2009-09-15T09:20:00.000Z	cainram		I mounted an ISO as a volume and all was well until I rebooted. Now I've got this thing on my desktop (not an actual file in my home/desktop) that says XYZ.volume. I can't get rid of it.
2009-09-15T09:21:00.000Z	cainram		XYZ.iso.volume, sorry
2009-09-15T09:21:00.000Z	cainram		Running a current 9.04 install
2009-09-15T09:22:00.000Z	DasEi	cainram	did you try to remove the mountpoint of the farmer iso-file ?
2009-09-15T09:22:00.000Z	cainram		no, I'm not sure what you mean...
2009-09-15T09:23:00.000Z	DasEi	cainram	you said you mounted an iso; every fs is mounted to a directory...
2009-09-15T09:24:00.000Z	cainram	DasEi	i'm not seeing anything in /mnt or /media related to my problem, is this what you mean?
2009-09-15T09:26:00.000Z	cainram		How does Gnome Keep track of my pseudo-desktop stuff? is it a text or config file somewhere that I could manually edit?
2009-09-15T09:26:00.000Z	DasEi	cainram	if you right-click the symbol on you disk > properties > volume , something given there ?
2009-09-15T09:26:00.000Z	cainram		You know, like mounted volumes and launchers...
2009-09-15T09:26:00.000Z	cainram		Hmm, one second
2009-09-15T09:27:00.000Z	cainram		Hal?
2009-09-15T09:27:00.000Z	cainram		I feel like more of a noob every day...
2009-09-15T09:28:00.000Z	cainram		location is listed as "x-nautilus-desktop:///"
2009-09-15T09:28:00.000Z	cainram		It isn't acting like a mounted volume
2009-09-15T09:28:00.000Z	cainram		one sec
2009-09-15T09:29:00.000Z	DasEi	cainram	simply drag icon into trash ?
