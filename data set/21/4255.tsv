2009-08-17T22:07:00.000Z	Flinx		hello
2009-08-17T22:07:00.000Z	Flinx		when I run putty (sudo putty) I get the following output "Gtk-WARNING **: Failed to load module "libcanberra-gtk-module.so": libcanberra-gtk-module.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"
2009-08-17T22:08:00.000Z	Grim76__	Flinx	Trying to run putty on linux?
2009-08-17T22:08:00.000Z	Flinx		yes
2009-08-17T22:08:00.000Z	Flinx	Grim76__	Xubuntu
2009-08-17T22:08:00.000Z	Grim76__	Flinx	Just open a console.  Putty is not really necessary.
2009-08-17T22:09:00.000Z	Flinx	Grim76__	i'm using it to talk to TTYS0
2009-08-17T22:09:00.000Z	Flinx	Grim76__	Putty Opens, but I'm trying to find out why I get that message
2009-08-17T22:10:00.000Z	Grim76__	Flinx	Ah!  Not sure I am going to be much help there.  I have not had to talk to anything serial.
2009-08-17T22:11:00.000Z	Flinx	Grim76__	Serial connectivity works fine. At this point the error message is more of a nuisance
2009-08-17T22:13:00.000Z	Grim76__	Flinx	ok...  Someone might be a bit more knowledgable with usint putty assuming through wine on Linux to talk to a serial device.  I know that I have a friend that has used minicom for his needs like that.
2009-08-17T22:14:00.000Z	Flinx		okay
2009-08-17T22:15:00.000Z	Flinx	Grim76__	PuTTY was installed natively; apt-get install putty
2009-08-17T22:15:00.000Z	Grim76__	Flinx	Never even knew it was in the repositories.
2009-08-17T22:15:00.000Z	Flinx		I think I just need to find a package that contains the libcanbera-gtk
2009-08-17T22:15:00.000Z	Flinx	Grim76__	No Worries :)
2009-08-17T22:16:00.000Z	Grim76__	Flinx	Do an apt-cache search for libcan and see if those meet what you are looking for.
2009-08-17T22:20:00.000Z	Flinx	Grim76__	Hrm.. "libcanberra-gtk-module" looks suspiciously like the package I need. Thanks!
2009-08-17T22:20:00.000Z	Flinx	Grim76__	I always forget how to search repo's XD
2009-08-17T22:20:00.000Z	Grim76__	Flinx	Glad I could point you in possibly the right direction.
2009-08-17T22:22:00.000Z	Grim76__	Flinx	Not a problem.  I am the same way always forget one little piece.
