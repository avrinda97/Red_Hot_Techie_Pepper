2008-07-08T15:51:00.000Z	neopsyche		right
2008-07-08T15:52:00.000Z	FlyingWV	neopsyche	Does sudo fdisk -l show a windows partition?
2008-07-08T15:53:00.000Z	neopsyche	FlyingWV	i inserted 8.04 booted to live cd mode. chose install inside windows option. rebooted. got error A disk read error has occurred press ctrl alt del to reboot
2008-07-08T15:53:00.000Z	neopsyche	FlyingWV	???
2008-07-08T15:54:00.000Z	FlyingWV	neopsyche	Can you open up a terminal and type sudo fdisk -l
2008-07-08T15:54:00.000Z	neopsyche	FlyingWV	inside windows repair console it states: directory of C:\ An error occurred during directory enumeration
2008-07-08T15:54:00.000Z	neopsyche	FlyingWV	i cannot since it will not boot
2008-07-08T15:56:00.000Z	FlyingWV	neopsyche	So you should be able to load up the live cd, and go to the terminal, and try fdisk -l
2008-07-08T15:56:00.000Z	neopsyche	FlyingWV	ok
2008-07-08T15:56:00.000Z	FlyingWV	neopsyche	well sudo fdisk -l
2008-07-08T15:56:00.000Z	neopsyche	FlyingWV	thats what i was trying to do with the Windows CD
2008-07-08T15:56:00.000Z	neopsyche	FlyingWV	what will that do? list my files?
2008-07-08T15:57:00.000Z	FlyingWV	neopsyche	It will list your hard drive partitions
2008-07-08T15:57:00.000Z	neopsyche	FlyingWV	its rather disconcerting for new windows users who are interested in trying ubuntu for the first time to be greeted with 'A disk read error has occurred' and the only thing they can do is reboot. this gives ubuntu a VERY bad name amongst the average users who are not tech savvy.
2008-07-08T15:59:00.000Z	FlyingWV	neopsyche	Did you use wubi? I've no experience with that myself
2008-07-08T16:00:00.000Z	neopsyche	FlyingWV	i assume so, since i used the default installation option in the live cd for installing alongside windows, so if wubi is what that is then i suppose i did use it.. if it is not what it is then no.
2008-07-08T16:01:00.000Z	FlyingWV	neopsyche	Which comes back to my fdisk querry, I'm afraid you may have erased your windows installation
2008-07-08T16:02:00.000Z	neopsyche	FlyingWV	if it gives the option to "install alongside" windows, why would it delete it.. and why would that be "my" fault.. if "i" selected the option to install "alongside" why would it "completely erase" instead of doing what it was supposed to in regard to installing "alongside" windows and if it has .then whose "fault" is that .. the programmer or the user?
2008-07-08T16:03:00.000Z	FlyingWV	neopsyche	I never alluded to blame, just my suspicion about what happened
