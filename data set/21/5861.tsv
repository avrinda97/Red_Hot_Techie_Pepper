2009-02-13T12:25:00.000Z	kingsley_		When a BIOS is configured to boot from the CD drive before the hard disk, and a 8.04.2-desktop-i386.iso CD is in the CD drive, pressing the reset button results in the message "Boot from CD", but then tries to run an old copy of windows on the hard drive. What else, if anything, should be done to boot from the CD?
2009-02-13T12:25:00.000Z	CaneToad	kingsley_	works for me... can you read the CD on another PC?
2009-02-13T12:26:00.000Z	kingsley_	CaneToad	That's a good idea. I may try to boot it with qemu.
2009-02-13T12:38:00.000Z	kingsley_	CaneToad	Is it realistic to expect that a bootable CD of 8.04.2-desktop-i386.iso can be burned with the application named "k3b"?
2009-02-13T12:41:00.000Z	CaneToad	kingsley_	yeah but when you burned it, did you (1) burn the ISO as a file on the CD, or (2) burn the ISO to the CD such that the CD is identical to the contents of the ISO, ie multiple files etc
2009-02-13T12:43:00.000Z	kingsley_	CaneToad	I assume I burned the ISO as one big file, because that's how k3b has worked for me in the past. However, it does balk with this ISO about the filename being too long for a joliet file system, which is something I've never seen before.
2009-02-13T12:43:00.000Z	CaneToad	kingsley_	ok you did the wrong thing
2009-02-13T12:44:00.000Z	CaneToad	kingsley_	hangon I'll start up k3b and tell ya
2009-02-13T12:45:00.000Z	CaneToad	kingsley_	you need to run K3B and then from the menu choose Tools/Burn CD Image, and then choose the iso file as the image to burn
2009-02-13T12:47:00.000Z	kingsley_	CaneToad	Indeed, that's different that how I usually burn linux CDs. I usually do: run k3b -> click on "New Data CD Project" -> drag the filename down to the project area -> click on burn.
2009-02-13T12:48:00.000Z	CaneToad	kingsley_	yup that's right....you'll never get a bootable CD unless you use this approach
2009-02-13T12:49:00.000Z	kingsley_	CaneToad	Do you happen to know why ubuntu requires this approach, and other linux CDs do not?
2009-02-13T12:49:00.000Z	CaneToad	kingsley_	have you used k3b in the past to do this, or other burning software?
2009-02-13T12:49:00.000Z	kingsley_	CaneToad	I've used k3b in the past.
2009-02-13T12:52:00.000Z	CaneToad	kingsley_	you must be clicking the "burn the image directly" button in k3b when you drag instead of "add the file to the project", right?
2009-02-13T12:52:00.000Z	CaneToad		that approach is ok too
2009-02-13T12:52:00.000Z	kingsley_	CaneToad	For what it's worth, I just burned a CD as you advised.
2009-02-13T12:54:00.000Z	kingsley_	CaneToad	My recollection is that that I've successfully burned data CDs several ways.
2009-02-13T12:54:00.000Z	CaneToad	kingsley_	I hope it works for you!!
2009-02-13T12:55:00.000Z	kingsley_	CaneToad	I'm happy to report that doing it your way worked.
2009-02-13T12:55:00.000Z	kingsley_	CaneToad	Thank you.
