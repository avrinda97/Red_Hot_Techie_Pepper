2012-10-12T10:17:00.000Z	Vernon		I cannot boot into either the install system on hard drive or try ubuntu without installing. I have tried nomodeset and all I get after it tries to boot is a black screen. I am trying to install on a HP Pavilion g6
2012-10-12T10:19:00.000Z	Vernon		It is using the integrated graphics off of the 2nd Gen i3.
2012-10-12T10:21:00.000Z	Vernon		I have not, would one of these versions guarantee compatibilty? I am running the 12.04 install
2012-10-12T10:21:00.000Z	Vernon		It fails at the point it needs to load a login screen.
2012-10-12T10:21:00.000Z	crizis	Vernon	no, just ignore that suggestion. they all use same installer/livecd tech
2012-10-12T10:22:00.000Z	crizis	Vernon	so you got it installed?
2012-10-12T10:23:00.000Z	crizis	Vernon	http://askubuntu.com/questions/77006/black-screen-when-booting-up-on-an-hp-pavilion-g6 guessing from this, this particular hp model is pretty much dead end
2012-10-12T10:25:00.000Z	Vernon	crizis	So... I have a machine that is a victim to inccompatabilities? Pretty much a P.O.S?
2012-10-12T10:25:00.000Z	crizis	Vernon	so it seems, if nomodeset doesn't help
2012-10-12T10:28:00.000Z	crizis	Vernon	these all ubuntu spins run the same kernel and same x version, and this is a kernel problem
2012-10-12T10:28:00.000Z	crizis	Vernon	that part is pretty clear with 10sec googling
2012-10-12T10:28:00.000Z	crizis	Vernon	in a nutshell from what i gather, intel G6's work with modeset, but AMD versions are hopeless
2012-10-12T10:30:00.000Z	crizis	Vernon	it's a shame that ubuntu removed alternate install cd with 12.04.. this would give you text-mode installer
2012-10-12T10:30:00.000Z	crizis	Vernon	alternative for now for you would be to install using server install cd and install 'ubuntu-desktop' metapackage afterwards
2012-10-12T10:31:00.000Z	crizis	Vernon	so, i recommend testing that. a bit harder/longer route, but will give you pretty much the same installation afterwards
2012-10-12T10:31:00.000Z	crizis	Vernon	then you can at least try to setup X with real installation :)
2012-10-12T10:32:00.000Z	crizis	Vernon	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1996256 there's also something related to G6, it's kinda bizarre that nomodeset doesn't help for you
2012-10-12T10:36:00.000Z	crizis	Vernon	for the future machines, i recommend http://www.ubuntu.com/certification/ ;) saves a lot of trouble to make sure it's certified for ubuntu. also pretty much guarantees general linux support for other distros too
2012-10-12T10:37:00.000Z	crizis	Vernon	especially i recommend thinkpads, almost every model is fully certified for linux.
2012-10-12T10:41:00.000Z	crizis	Vernon	intel and amd do, nvidia doesn't
2012-10-12T10:42:00.000Z	crizis	Vernon	the real problem likely is some random cheap chipset, unrelated to intel's stuff. just guessing.
