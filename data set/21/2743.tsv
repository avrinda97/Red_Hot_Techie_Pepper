2010-07-14T05:13:00.000Z	acrousey		what's the command for erasing my entire disk?
2010-07-14T05:15:00.000Z	acrousey		I want a fresh start with ubuntu. What's the command for erasing an entire disk?
2010-07-14T05:15:00.000Z	Bookman	acrousey	install on top of your present disk
2010-07-14T05:17:00.000Z	acrousey		Bookman/Jordan_U, I've been trying to do that, but it won't take the CD's that I used originally to install it. Like 9.04, 8.10 or even 8.04 or not working. I think I did something I shouldn't have when I was trying to get around the "mountall" bug.
2010-07-14T05:18:00.000Z	Bookman	acrousey	well erasing your disk will not solve that.\
2010-07-14T05:18:00.000Z	Bookman	acrousey	you have a CD problem then.
2010-07-14T05:18:00.000Z	acrousey		there's errors on the CD
2010-07-14T05:19:00.000Z	acrousey		How can i get into BIOS and change it to my alternative CD player?
2010-07-14T05:20:00.000Z	Bookman	acrousey	how will that help you error filled CD?
2010-07-14T05:20:00.000Z	acrousey	Bookman	I used the 8.04 CD when I first got ubuntu
2010-07-14T05:21:00.000Z	acrousey		and now it's not working
2010-07-14T05:21:00.000Z	Bookman	acrousey	and when you try that again, what is the error?
2010-07-14T05:22:00.000Z	acrousey	Bookman	it freezes on the ubuntu loading back and forth screen
2010-07-14T05:23:00.000Z	Bookman	acrousey	ok, is it trying to boot from the CD? Is the light on?
2010-07-14T05:23:00.000Z	acrousey		bookman, yeah, but should it be freezing in the middle of loading?
2010-07-14T05:23:00.000Z	Bookman	acrousey	for how long?
2010-07-14T05:24:00.000Z	acrousey		bookman, about five minutes or so
2010-07-14T05:25:00.000Z	acrousey		bookman, it is a pentium 3, and I understand that it'll be running a little slower, but I restart it at about 5 minutes just because I get tired of waiting. Would you suggest more patience?
2010-07-14T05:25:00.000Z	Bookman	acrousey	you are sure it is booting off the CD?  Try holding DEL when you power up, or ESC
2010-07-14T05:25:00.000Z	Bookman		Make sure you are booting off CD
2010-07-14T05:25:00.000Z	Bookman	acrousey	did you boot from HD before?
