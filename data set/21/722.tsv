2011-07-14T16:23:00.000Z	Dark_owl		anyone to help me in WI-FI ?
2011-07-14T16:25:00.000Z	Dark_owl		I CAN NOT BROWSE INTERNET !!! X(
2011-07-14T16:25:00.000Z	Ileden	Dark_owl	... but apparently the caps-lock key still works?
2011-07-14T16:26:00.000Z	Ileden	Dark_owl	you can get better help if you describe the problem a bit more.
2011-07-14T16:27:00.000Z	Ileden	Dark_owl	has it always been like that?
2011-07-14T16:27:00.000Z	Ileden	Dark_owl	or did the problem suddlenly appear? or appear after an update?
2011-07-14T16:27:00.000Z	Ileden	Dark_owl	can you try if the net works ok with a wired cable instead of wifi?
2011-07-14T16:28:00.000Z	Ileden	Dark_owl	ok.. sounds like a driver issue...
2011-07-14T16:29:00.000Z	Ileden	Dark_owl	have you tried using a wire with ubuntu?
2011-07-14T16:29:00.000Z	Ileden	Dark_owl	if it is a driver issue, you could use something called "ndiswrapper", which is basically a way to use your windows wifi driver on linux.
2011-07-14T16:32:00.000Z	Dark_owl	Ileden	the adapter works well
2011-07-14T16:32:00.000Z	Ileden	Dark_owl	it could be the adapter works ok, but linux doesn't work well with the adapter. or even that linux doesn't work well with the adapter & wireless station combination. have you tried the ubuntu on any other wifi network?
2011-07-14T16:36:00.000Z	Ileden	Dark_owl	joking? i've only made one joke, that was about your all-caps message.
2011-07-14T16:37:00.000Z	Ileden	Dark_owl	it's not a joke that the linux drivers might not work with the adapter, even if it's otherwise ok.
2011-07-14T16:38:00.000Z	Ileden	Dark_owl	and I've personally seen a perfectly ok adapter working with linux fail on another wifi station too, so that's quite possible as well. no jokes.
2011-07-14T16:38:00.000Z	Dark_owl	Ileden	so i should install another sriver ?
2011-07-14T16:39:00.000Z	Ileden	Dark_owl	if I were you, I'd try using the windows driver via ndiswrapper
2011-07-14T16:40:00.000Z	Ileden	Dark_owl	or maybe see if the linux driver (which is a kernel module) has some options to try
2011-07-14T16:41:00.000Z	Dark_owl	Ileden	and to check that options ?
2011-07-14T16:43:00.000Z	Ileden	Dark_owl	unfortunately i have to go now. ask someone about how to find out what kernel module your wifi card is using ,and how to check if it has options
2011-07-14T16:43:00.000Z	Ileden	Dark_owl	i would help you but i really have to go.
