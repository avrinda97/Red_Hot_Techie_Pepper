2008-12-17T06:45:00.000Z	ehama		Hi. Need help with pidgin. I don't know the real reason but seems like my brother using another MSN account now makes the program freeze with the whole PC. Any way to fully uninstall it with my accounts?

2008-12-17T06:48:00.000Z	ehama	raylu	there doesn't seem to be any configuration files in my home directory related with pidgin.

2008-12-19T13:09:00.000Z	ehama	raylu	here is the screenshot. Is it normal? http://i42.tinypic.com/zk0npy.png
2008-12-19T13:10:00.000Z	raylu	ehama	the only problem i see there is that the title bar is being covered by your top panel
2008-12-19T13:10:00.000Z	raylu	ehama	do you have a keyboard shortcut for move/resize?
2008-12-19T13:10:00.000Z	raylu	ehama	try holding down alt and draggin it
2008-12-19T13:11:00.000Z	ehama	raylu	yes when I drag I can see them.
2008-12-19T13:11:00.000Z	raylu	ehama	...
2008-12-19T13:11:00.000Z	raylu	ehama	ok, so make it smaller now
2008-12-19T13:11:00.000Z	ehama	raylu	but I want a premenant solution. It is always ike this when I start firefox.
2008-12-19T13:12:00.000Z	raylu	ehama	it should remember it's position...you could also just maximize it
2008-12-19T13:12:00.000Z	ehama	raylu	yes it should. But it doesn't.
2008-12-19T13:13:00.000Z	ehama	raylu	I think I'll just try reinstalling.
2008-12-19T13:13:00.000Z	raylu	ehama	strange. no idea, sorry
2008-12-19T13:16:00.000Z	ehama	raylu	yes but it was a recent install, so doesn't bother me that much.
