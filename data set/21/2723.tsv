2009-07-14T09:40:00.000Z	jakerue		ok I may well be retarded but what is happening with inetd here?  I am trying to set up Samba and put in SWAT which notified me that smbd and nmbd were not running....did some edits and was able to edit  /etc/inetd.conf but now cannot start it....what gives?
2009-07-14T09:40:00.000Z	jakerue		getting sudo: /etc/init.d/inetd: command not found
2009-07-14T09:42:00.000Z	losher	jakerue	I thought it was called xinetd in Ubuntu...
2009-07-14T09:50:00.000Z	jakerue	losher	I think it is but the only howto I could find for getting nmbd and smbd running are through inetd
2009-07-14T09:51:00.000Z	losher	jakerue	that's odd. I never run smbd through (x)inetd. I just install it & configure /etc/samba/smb.conf
2009-07-14T09:52:00.000Z	jakerue	losher	what I am reading says Samba needs smnd and nmbd to work and they are not running.....
2009-07-14T09:53:00.000Z	losher	jakerue	understood. Once installed, and /etc/samba/smb.conf is configure (correctly!) then sudo /etc/init.d/samba restart will start the daemons. No need to involve (x)inetd
2009-07-14T09:58:00.000Z	jakerue	losher	Dr_Willis, did both your recommends, went back to SWAT....neither service is running
2009-10-01T03:53:00.000Z	losher	jakerue	ask again...
2009-10-01T03:54:00.000Z	losher	jakerue	a 'chuck'?
2009-10-01T03:54:00.000Z	jakerue	losher	- should read 'chunk'
2009-10-01T03:55:00.000Z	losher	jakerue	right. ok, staty by opening a terminal, run sudo fdisk -l and paste the result to paste.ubuntu.com
2009-10-01T03:56:00.000Z	losher	jakerue	staty -> start
2009-10-01T03:57:00.000Z	jakerue	losher	- Here it is http://paste.ubuntu.com/282521/
2009-10-01T04:00:00.000Z	jakerue	losher	- OK off to work.  I think I found a thread that will help me
2009-10-01T04:00:00.000Z	losher	jakerue	ok, so I see about 50G on sda1, 100G on sda5 and 11G on sda6, for a total of 160G which is your disk. So what exactly was resized, sda5?
2009-10-01T04:00:00.000Z	jakerue	losher	- yep.  Gotta run though.  What commands should I be looking for to make this work?
2009-10-01T04:01:00.000Z	losher	jakerue	df -h would be next...
2009-10-01T04:02:00.000Z	jakerue	losher	- that only shows % of sda1 and sdb1 ....sda5 not shown
2009-10-01T04:02:00.000Z	jakerue	losher	- thanks for the help but I really have to run.  Next time
2009-10-01T04:02:00.000Z	losher	jakerue	that usually means sda5 isn't mounted. That would explain why you don't see it... ok, next time
