2006-11-15T15:04:00.000Z	hamdinp		how am I install p7zip-full_4.43~dfsg.1-1_i386.deb ?
2006-11-15T15:05:00.000Z	LjL	hamdinp	do you really need 4.43 as opposed to 4.42? =)
2006-11-15T15:07:00.000Z	LjL	hamdinp	it's "apt-get install p7zip-full"
2006-11-15T15:08:00.000Z	LjL	hamdinp	read about APT a little. you don't manually download and then install - the apt-get command downloads *and* installs
2006-11-15T15:28:00.000Z	LjL	hamdinp	*NO*, you need to type "sudo apt-get install p7zip-full" (after enabling universe), not the file name. you don't need to download *any* file manually, at least unless you've got a very compelling reason to use version 4.43 instead of 4.42
2006-11-15T16:13:00.000Z	LjL	hamdinp	uh?! no!
2006-11-15T16:14:00.000Z	LjL	hamdinp	are you still trying to install p7zip?
2006-11-15T16:14:00.000Z	LjL	hamdinp	you haven't given me a valid reason yet why you should use that hand-downloaded package rather than the official one
2006-11-15T16:14:00.000Z	LjL	hamdinp	which?
2006-11-15T16:17:00.000Z	LjL	hamdinp	well, the bot isn't working, but there is that package in Universe
2006-11-15T16:17:00.000Z	LjL	hamdinp	you did what?
2006-11-15T16:21:00.000Z	LjL	hamdinp	that is,  "http://www.sonsuzdongu.com/paketler/ ./"  ?
2006-11-15T16:21:00.000Z	LjL	hamdinp	is that repository Ubuntu-specific?
2006-11-15T16:22:00.000Z	LjL	hamdinp	ok, and the problem is? (though - answer my question, is that an ubuntu repository?)
2006-11-15T16:24:00.000Z	LjL	hamdinp	yes, because THAT IS NOT an Ubuntu package. use the official Ubuntu package. just type "sudo apt-get install p7zip-full" after enabling Universe
2006-11-15T16:24:00.000Z	LjL	hamdinp	and this is the foruth time i tell you
2006-11-15T16:38:00.000Z	LjL	hamdinp	yes, as you have to *enable universe* first
2006-11-15T16:40:00.000Z	LjL	hamdinp	The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. See http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories
2006-11-15T16:40:00.000Z	LjL	hamdinp	there is also source-o-matic at http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic
2006-11-15T16:41:00.000Z	LjL	hamdinp	the short answer is, you enable universe by adding "universe" after "main" and "restricted" in your /etc/apt/sources.list (on the "edgy", "edgy-updates" and "edgy-security" lines). but you better read the guide
