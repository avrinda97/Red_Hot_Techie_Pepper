2012-05-05T02:19:00.000Z	Restringere		but it sucks, I regret upgrading should have stuck with 2.8 rc 1, the performance lags terribly and is jittery
2012-05-05T02:20:00.000Z	Restringere		I have a good setup - dual core 2.2ghz, 2 gigs of ddr2 ram, Nvidia 8400M GS - and GIMP 2.8 was slow slow slow jittery and horrible
2012-05-05T02:21:00.000Z	Restringere		I dont know why 12.10 running XFCE is so jittery
2012-05-05T02:21:00.000Z	Restringere		Any tips?
2012-05-05T02:21:00.000Z	Restringere		And there is strange load and lag
2012-05-05T02:22:00.000Z	Restringere		is this load average ok 0.81, 0.77, 0.79
2012-05-05T02:22:00.000Z	Restringere		I dont know why its acting so strange
2012-05-05T02:22:00.000Z	Restringere		Is there a way to increase performance other than the typical settings?
2012-05-05T02:24:00.000Z	Restringere		I love the base

2012-05-05T02:26:00.000Z	Restringere	modernbob	but Im on a Vostro 1500, so my specs arent that great
2012-05-05T02:27:00.000Z	Restringere	modernbob	its really a slow one
2012-05-05T02:28:00.000Z	Restringere		it dont get it
2012-05-05T02:28:00.000Z	Restringere		2.8 RC1 worked brilliantly on my system
2012-05-05T02:28:00.000Z	Restringere		but 2.8 Stable is a dog
2012-05-05T02:28:00.000Z	Restringere		I was editing huge 30 mb PDF's with no problems
2012-05-05T02:28:00.000Z	Restringere		How can I get it again?
2012-05-05T02:28:00.000Z	Restringere		How do I specify apt-get to get a certain version
2012-05-05T02:29:00.000Z	Restringere		But use the paint tools, you will see a lag
2012-05-05T02:29:00.000Z	zykotic10	Restringere	apt-get doesn't really have version support, it installs the newest available in your repositories
