2008-11-09T08:26:00.000Z	roffe		This is so annoying.. I have the infamous atheros wireless card that caused a lot of issues in the last versions of ubuntu..And now that I've installed 8.10 it still doesn't work
2008-11-09T08:27:00.000Z	ziroday	roffe	which card?
2008-11-09T08:27:00.000Z	roffe	ziroday	ar5007
2008-11-09T08:27:00.000Z	ziroday	roffe	one sec
2008-11-09T08:27:00.000Z	ziroday	roffe	have you read the release notes?
2008-11-09T08:27:00.000Z	roffe	ziroday	unfortunately not
2008-11-09T08:29:00.000Z	ziroday	roffe	that will hopefully get your card working
2008-11-09T08:31:00.000Z	roffe	ziroday	I will read it more properly, but the proprietary drivers claim the wireless is installed, yet I don't have the option in the networkmanager to choose any wireless
2008-11-09T08:32:00.000Z	ziroday	roffe	yeah thats known, the package it tells you to install has the newer ath5k dirver with better support for your card
2008-11-09T08:33:00.000Z	roffe	ziroday	so, they should be activated eventhough I can't get access to wireless in the nwm?
2008-11-09T08:33:00.000Z	ziroday	roffe	sorry, I don't follow
2008-11-09T08:34:00.000Z	roffe	ziroday	the proprietary drivers.. should they be activated? Because even if they are I don't get to see anything about wireless in the networkmanager
2008-11-09T08:35:00.000Z	ziroday	roffe	you installed the linux-backports-modules-intrepid-generic correct?
2008-11-09T08:36:00.000Z	roffe	ziroday	No I haven't done anything like that.. does it say about that in the link you gave?
2008-11-09T08:37:00.000Z	ziroday	roffe	this tells you how to get it working http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/810#Atheros%20ath5k%20wireless%20driver%20not%20enabled%20by%20default
2008-11-09T08:39:00.000Z	roffe	ziroday	Sure it mentions it, but I'm not very savvy on Ubuntu.. how do install such a package? It claims to be on the cd
2008-11-09T08:39:00.000Z	ziroday	roffe	can you hook your laptop up to an ethernet cable briefly?
2008-11-09T08:39:00.000Z	roffe	ziroday	I'm on it now
2008-11-09T08:40:00.000Z	ziroday	roffe	open a terminal and type in sudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-intrepid-generic
2008-11-09T08:48:00.000Z	roffe	ziroday	Painless installation. Works perfect! Thanks a lot.
2008-11-09T08:48:00.000Z	ziroday	roffe	wonderful!
