2007-02-01T17:43:00.000Z	Ricket		yay my fsck'ed computer started up XD
2007-02-01T17:44:00.000Z	Ricket		i think the linux writers named it "fsck" on purpose, instead of calling it something like "chkdsk" like windows :)
2007-02-01T17:46:00.000Z	Ricket		What is a good, lightweight torrent client for Linux? I use uTorrent on Windows XP but I might switch my main "server" computer to Linux if I can find equivalents of all my Windows programs... Which isn't very many :)
2007-02-01T17:47:00.000Z	Ricket		but isn't that for the other desktop which ubuntu isn't?
2007-02-01T17:48:00.000Z	Ricket		i mean K[blah] , not wine
2007-02-01T17:48:00.000Z	Ricket		ah, okay, cool.
2007-02-01T17:49:00.000Z	Ricket		i have a WG111 netgear wireless adapter and I got it working
2007-02-01T17:49:00.000Z	Ricket		it required ndiswrapper, and blacklisting some interfering drivers
2007-02-01T17:49:00.000Z	mneptok	Ricket	looking for a torrent client? ;)
2007-02-01T17:50:00.000Z	Ricket	mneptok	of course
2007-02-01T17:50:00.000Z	mneptok	Ricket	sudo aptitude install bittornado-gui
2007-02-01T17:51:00.000Z	mneptok	Ricket	go with BitTornado. runs natively, has a good feature set, and can be used from a CLI or GUI
2007-02-01T17:56:00.000Z	mneptok	Ricket	one word. regedit.
2007-02-01T17:56:00.000Z	Ricket	mneptok	linux has a registry??
2007-02-01T17:56:00.000Z	Ricket	mneptok	oh lol nvm, i get it. you're saying it's complicated
2007-02-01T17:57:00.000Z	mneptok	Ricket	i'm saying "Linux is no more complicated for a Windows user than is Windows for a Linux user."
2007-02-01T17:58:00.000Z	Ricket	mneptok	could be. i haven't been a linux user so...
2007-02-01T17:59:00.000Z	mneptok	Ricket	say i want to install a good bitmap editor. in Ubuntu i type "sudo aptitude install gimp" how abouit Windows?
2007-02-01T17:59:00.000Z	Ricket	mneptok	yes, I agree Linux sure wins with its package manager
2007-02-01T17:59:00.000Z	Ricket	mneptok	but in Windows, to get my video card to work I went to ati.com and installed the universal drivers. can't say the same for Ubuntu...
2007-02-01T06:05:00.000Z	mneptok	Ricket	re: video drivers .... *that's an ATI problem, not a Linux problem*
