2008-11-03T23:47:00.000Z	edmont		do you know what can be the cause for grub to not being installed after a 8.10 installation?
2008-11-03T23:48:00.000Z	MnemonicPunk	edmont	In my case, the reason was that the installer crashed when it tried to install it. >_>
2008-11-03T23:48:00.000Z	edmont	MnemonicPunk	i think my installation didnt crash
2008-11-03T23:49:00.000Z	MnemonicPunk	edmont	Grub still gone? Or did you get it back?
2008-11-03T23:49:00.000Z	MnemonicPunk	edmont	(There's also an "advanced" option that allows you to choose whether you want to install Grub or not. It's checked by default though, so you probably didn't change it.)
2008-11-03T23:49:00.000Z	edmont	MnemonicPunk	still gone
2008-11-03T23:50:00.000Z	MnemonicPunk	edmont	Then reinstall manually. =)
2008-11-03T23:50:00.000Z	edmont	MnemonicPunk	i tried chroot
2008-11-03T23:50:00.000Z	edmont	MnemonicPunk	i cannot access my ubuntu installation
2008-11-03T23:51:00.000Z	MnemonicPunk	edmont	When using the chroot way to install grub, it's important that both Linuxes use the same architecture (e.g. x86 or x64)
2008-11-03T23:51:00.000Z	edmont	MnemonicPunk	they do, but i got an error with the BIOS driver for /dev/sda or something
2008-11-03T23:52:00.000Z	MnemonicPunk	edmont	Can you paste that?
2008-11-03T23:52:00.000Z	edmont	MnemonicPunk	nop, i didnt write it down
2008-11-03T23:53:00.000Z	MnemonicPunk	edmont	Can't help you much without any idea what went wrong. :D
2008-11-03T23:53:00.000Z	MnemonicPunk	edmont	Are you familiar with manually mounting partitions?
2008-11-03T23:54:00.000Z	edmont	MnemonicPunk	i am trying to find the error in google
2008-11-03T23:55:00.000Z	edmont	MnemonicPunk	yes, i know how to mount partitions
2008-11-04T00:01:00.000Z	MnemonicPunk	edmont	Are you on a RAID of some kind?
2008-11-04T00:01:00.000Z	edmont	MnemonicPunk	nop
2008-11-04T00:03:00.000Z	MnemonicPunk	edmont	Sorry, no clues then. Your system probably can't find it, no idea for what reason though. Try rebooting and watching the messages/reading the logs so you find out what causes it.
2008-11-04T00:03:00.000Z	edmont	MnemonicPunk	thanks, i'll try
