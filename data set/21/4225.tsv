2008-06-06T21:05:00.000Z	LinuxApe	yuriy	 are you running 8.04?
2008-06-06T21:08:00.000Z	yuriy	LinuxApe	yes
2008-06-06T21:09:00.000Z	LinuxApe	yuriy	did you check the hardware drivers manager?  when you enable the bc34 driver it will automatically download the firmware ripper to enable your wireless and configure it correctly.
2008-06-06T21:15:00.000Z	yuriy	LinuxApe	currently trying ndiswrapper, but no it doesn't show up in there
2008-06-06T21:15:00.000Z	yuriy		gettting the same results with ndiswrapper as with b43
2008-06-06T21:15:00.000Z	LinuxApe		no, ndiswrapper won't - just the bc43 drivers.
2008-06-06T21:16:00.000Z	LinuxApe	yuriy	 Do you know that the access point is broadcasting it's ssid?
2008-06-06T21:16:00.000Z	yuriy	LinuxApe	it is. there should be several here and I can see them all on my laptop 5 feet away
2008-06-06T21:17:00.000Z	yuriy	LinuxApe	several ssid's that is
2008-06-06T21:17:00.000Z	LinuxApe	yuriy	 dumb question:  is the wireless enabled?
2008-06-06T21:18:00.000Z	yuriy	LinuxApe	tbh that's what I've been wondering. the hot key doesn't work though
2008-06-06T21:20:00.000Z	LinuxApe	yuriy	 if the hot key isn't working, that usually means the drivers are not set up correctly.
2008-06-06T21:20:00.000Z	LinuxApe	yuriy	 or the wrong driver is installed.
2008-06-06T21:20:00.000Z	yuriy	LinuxApe	dmesg says unknown key pressed
2008-06-06T21:23:00.000Z	LinuxApe	yuriy	 I would seriously consider removing ndiswrapper and going back to bc34.  You may not be loading the right drivers in ndiswrapper.
2008-06-06T21:23:00.000Z	LinuxApe	yuriy	 and the ripper for the bc34 module works like a charm.
2008-06-06T21:24:00.000Z	yuriy	LinuxApe	bc34? not b43?
2008-06-06T21:24:00.000Z	LinuxApe	yuriy	 checking...
2008-06-06T21:24:00.000Z	LinuxApe	yuriy	 my mistake, B34
2008-06-06T21:25:00.000Z	LinuxApe	yuriy	 shit, dislexia - B43
2008-06-06T21:25:00.000Z	yuriy	LinuxApe	well anyway, gave up. suggested she try 7.10 instead of 8.04 to see if maybe the older driver will work
