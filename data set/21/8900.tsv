2005-12-29T06:44:00.000Z	Opinie	Anil	right now I'm pretty sure you don't have any idea what's my real problem...
2005-12-29T06:44:00.000Z	Anil	Opinie	hey that's great! You dont have any problems man! :)
2005-12-29T06:45:00.000Z	Opinie	Anil	I think I do =(
2005-12-29T06:45:00.000Z	Anil	Opinie	tell me what happened. I'll try to help with whatever I got.
2005-12-29T06:46:00.000Z	Opinie	Anil	it's just pretty hard to explain... Every application from the panel disappeared
2005-12-29T06:46:00.000Z	Anil	Opinie	what's the big deal? You add them again!
2005-12-29T06:47:00.000Z	Anil	Opinie	ok ok I get you. You mean the open applications are not showing in the taskbar, right?
2005-12-29T06:48:00.000Z	Opinie	Anil	yeah... it was just hard to find the right words =)
2005-12-29T06:48:00.000Z	Opinie	Anil	So can you help me?
2005-12-29T06:49:00.000Z	Anil	Opinie	right click on the panel where you want to place taskbars, click "add to panel", and type "window" in the search bar.
2005-12-29T06:49:00.000Z	Anil	Opinie	then choose the "window list" and click OK
2005-12-29T06:50:00.000Z	Anil	Opinie	done?
2005-12-29T06:50:00.000Z	Anil	Opinie	it's pretty easy, just follow what I said above.
2005-12-29T06:50:00.000Z	Opinie	Anil	ok thanks got it working
2005-12-29T06:50:00.000Z	Anil	Opinie	great! :)
2005-12-29T06:51:00.000Z	Anil	Opinie	remember you can add so many things to the panel! Why not experiment right now? :)
2005-12-29T06:51:00.000Z	Opinie	Anil	I've experimented it a bit already before but just didn't know how to do that...
2005-12-29T06:52:00.000Z	Opinie	Anil	But thanks for helping and merry christmas
2005-12-29T06:52:00.000Z	Anil	Opinie	merry christmas to you too! :)
