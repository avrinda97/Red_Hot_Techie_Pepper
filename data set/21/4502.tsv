2008-06-07T03:40:00.000Z	SnakeArt		Hello.I'm trying to configure my canon mp210 printer on hardy, but I've received an error "unable to open parallel port device file: permission denied". what could be a cause?
2008-06-07T03:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	SnakeArt	are you on the lp group check with "id"
2008-06-07T03:44:00.000Z	SnakeArt	erUSUL	but I even don't know the name of that file. It's strange, because yesterday it works...I mean,it prints and today it is not...how to find that name?
2008-06-07T03:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	SnakeArt	what name? run id on terminal and make sure you are on the lp group
2008-06-07T03:46:00.000Z	SnakeArt	erUSUL	Ok. I'm sorry if I ask some stupid questions, but I'm having enough of configuring some hardware on linux.
2008-06-07T03:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	SnakeArt	no problem
2008-06-07T03:47:00.000Z	SnakeArt	erUSUL	ok. I have lpadmin on 108. Is this correct?
2008-06-07T03:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	SnakeArt	yep that should suffice
2008-06-07T03:49:00.000Z	erUSUL	SnakeArt	can you do ls -al /dev/lp*
2008-06-07T03:50:00.000Z	SnakeArt	erUSUL	I will try with  that.moment...
2008-06-07T03:50:00.000Z	SnakeArt	erUSUL	crw-rw---- 1 root scanner 6, 0 2008-06-07 00:03 /dev/lp0
2008-06-07T03:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	SnakeArt	o.0 mine is "root lp" is it a multifunction printer (with scanner)
2008-06-07T03:53:00.000Z	SnakeArt	erUSUL	yes, it is. I have no hope to get that scanner working in nearest future, but printer works until today. So what's wrong?
2008-06-07T03:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	SnakeArt	«sudo adduser <youruser> scanner»
2008-06-07T03:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	SnakeArt	for some reason the paralell port is in control of the scanner group ... the command i gave should make you member of the group
2008-06-07T03:55:00.000Z	SnakeArt	erUSUL	it says that I'm already a member of that group.
2008-06-07T03:59:00.000Z	SnakeArt	erUSUL	maybe you know the way to install 32bit drivers on 64bit os? I've tried to install mp210 drivers on my 64bit hardy but It's still not work.
2008-06-07T03:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	SnakeArt	no; i dunno sorry
2008-06-07T04:02:00.000Z	SnakeArt	erUSUL	I think that You should take a look at this : http://paste.ubuntu.com/17742/
