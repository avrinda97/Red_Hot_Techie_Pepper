2006-07-14T13:20:00.000Z	IRCMonkeyx		hi friends, i am going to install wine (for running win programs in ubuntu), but my windows drive is ntfs, will there be any problem?
2006-07-14T13:22:00.000Z	IRCMonkeyx		isnt wine for running win programs in linux???
2006-07-14T13:22:00.000Z	Warbo	IRCMonkeyx	You can copy some DLLs across from Windows to WINE which may make it run more stuff though
2006-07-14T13:26:00.000Z	Warbo	IRCMonkeyx	WINE replaces Windows functions, but if you legally have access to real Windows functions (ie. You have Windows DLLs installed) then you can use those for better compatibility
2006-07-14T13:28:00.000Z	Warbo	IRCMonkeyx	No, because you have installed Excel into the virtual WINE drive on your Linux partition
2006-07-29T07:10:00.000Z	Warbo	IRCMonkeyx	recovery mode gives you the most basic of text interfaces, so you can recover graphics and stuff. If your graphics are working then use them, it's easier
2006-07-29T07:12:00.000Z	IRCMonkeyx	Warbo	is recovery mode like safe mod in windows ? i am asking repair tool in ubuntu, remember how we repair windows by using xp cd...
2006-07-29T07:13:00.000Z	Warbo	IRCMonkeyx	"recovery mode" at bootup has no graphics or anything, just a text terminal. Only use it if your bootup really screws. There is a "safe mode" when you log in, which you can use if your user account has screwed up settings. If your normal login works then it is easier to recover a system from in there than from in recovery mode or safe mode
2006-07-29T07:14:00.000Z	Warbo	IRCMonkeyx	Why don't you tell us what your problems are we can see what we can do
2006-07-29T07:15:00.000Z	IRCMonkeyx	Warbo	i tried for my modem and i tihnk i crashed the things, ppp is crash and when click from administrator tool to disks, it says there is an backend script error
2006-07-29T07:17:00.000Z	Warbo	IRCMonkeyx	Have you changed the settings for those at all? First thing's first though, open a terminal from the Applications>Accessories menu, since it is easier to do stuff in there than messing around with graphical stuff (takes ages to describe graphics, but commands can be copy/pasted into the chat room)
2006-07-29T07:17:00.000Z	Warbo	IRCMonkeyx	There is no "repair", other than reinstall. You can fix it manually though
2006-07-29T07:18:00.000Z	IRCMonkeyx	Warbo	: i changed the settings of modem many times, and eciadsl-doctor says that your pp is crashed, i wanna use that graphical thing too from admin menu
2006-07-29T07:19:00.000Z	Warbo	IRCMonkeyx	So your internet connection is through a USB broadband modem?
2006-07-29T07:20:00.000Z	IRCMonkeyx	Warbo	yes  it would be, but it doesnt work, i am now on xp
2006-07-29T07:20:00.000Z	Warbo	IRCMonkeyx	OK, do you have your Ubuntu system up, or is it one computer which dual-boots?
2006-07-29T07:21:00.000Z	IRCMonkeyx	Warbo	One computer dual-boots
2006-07-29T07:23:00.000Z	Warbo	IRCMonkeyx	OK that makes life a bit more difficult. There is a way of accessing Ubuntu's drives from Windows which may help, but i forget it's name
2006-07-29T07:24:00.000Z	IRCMonkeyx	Warbo	i access windows drives from ubuntu . but no access from windows to ubuntu
2006-07-29T07:25:00.000Z	Warbo	IRCMonkeyx	Yes, there is an extra driver you can install on Windows though, I am looking for it now
2006-07-29T07:25:00.000Z	Warbo	IRCMonkeyx	Try installing that and see if you can access your Ubuntu drives
