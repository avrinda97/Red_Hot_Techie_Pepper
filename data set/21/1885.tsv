2011-04-14T00:28:00.000Z	Kyle__	jessicaBR	Are you running ubuntu server or desktop?
2011-04-14T00:29:00.000Z	jessicaBR	Kyle__	desktop. ubuntu maverick
2011-04-14T00:29:00.000Z	Kyle__	jessicaBR	Check system->administration->addition drivers
2011-04-14T00:29:00.000Z	jessicaBR	Kyle__	I'm on LiveCD, should I do that now?
2011-04-14T00:29:00.000Z	Kyle__	jessicaBR	Maybe there's a proprietary driver for your video card?  If there is, it may fix the issue.
2011-04-14T00:30:00.000Z	Kyle__	jessicaBR	Err  Maybe?  I dont' recall how the live cd works for changes.
2011-04-14T00:31:00.000Z	Kyle__	jessicaBR	You need the proprietary drivers for it to work properly iirc.  Or maybe I'm wrong, and installing the updating the system will work, but I really think you need the proprietary ones.
2011-04-14T00:33:00.000Z	jessicaBR	Kyle__	right now I'm using LiveCD. Don't think changes here will be kept for the other installations
2011-04-14T00:33:00.000Z	Kyle__	jessicaBR	Oh.  You mean you're not in graphics at all, livecd booted you into text mode?
2011-04-14T00:34:00.000Z	jessicaBR	Kyle__	no! I'm with grahics right now!
2011-04-14T00:34:00.000Z	jessicaBR	Kyle__	with live cd
2011-04-14T00:35:00.000Z	Kyle__	jessicaBR	In graphics, from the system menu, go to "administration", then "additional drivers"
2011-04-14T00:36:00.000Z	jessicaBR	Kyle__	ok, installing drivers
2011-04-14T00:36:00.000Z	jessicaBR	Kyle__	I think I already did that with my original installation
2011-04-14T00:36:00.000Z	Kyle__	jessicaBR	Out of curiosity, is this a mac-mini?
2011-04-14T00:37:00.000Z	jessicaBR	Kyle__	my computer? This is an Asus K50IE
2011-04-14T00:37:00.000Z	Kyle__	jessicaBR	Oh ok.  Just the only other device I've seen myself with that card is a mac-mini.
2011-04-14T00:38:00.000Z	jessicaBR	Kyle__	oh
2011-04-14T00:38:00.000Z	jessicaBR	Kyle__	is that good or bad?
2011-04-14T00:39:00.000Z	Kyle__	jessicaBR	I don't know to be honest, I was just curious, since I have a stack of 20 minis that will be turned into a cluster for the summer, and into student workstations for the fall.
2011-04-14T00:39:00.000Z	jessicaBR	Kyle__	nice
