2005-07-11T11:12:00.000Z	s1m0	cmatheson	i don't know
2005-07-11T11:13:00.000Z	cmatheson	s1m0	go search google real quick, search for your card w/ 'linux' after it and see what you can dig up
2005-07-11T11:13:00.000Z	cmatheson	s1m0	it's possible there is no driver, or that you need to get one from an external source
2005-07-11T11:14:00.000Z	s1m0	cmatheson	ok thanks
2005-07-11T11:15:00.000Z	cmatheson	s1m0	actually, can you type 'lspci' and then look for what kind of 'audio controller' it lists?
2005-07-11T11:16:00.000Z	s1m0	cmatheson	ok 2 seconds please
2005-07-11T11:17:00.000Z	s1m0	cmatheson	what do you nned?
2005-07-11T11:18:00.000Z	s1m0	cmatheson	i connect from the ubuntu computer with an other nick so i can paste the results?
2005-07-11T11:19:00.000Z	cmatheson	s1m0	yeah, you need to run this on the ubuntu computer: 'lspci'
2005-07-11T11:19:00.000Z	cmatheson	s1m0	it will list all the pci devices on your computer, just look for the one that says 'Multimedia audio controller' (or something along those lines), and  tell me what it is
2005-07-11T11:20:00.000Z	cmatheson	s1m0	go ahead and paste it in #flood
