2007-11-04T11:31:00.000Z	sjovan	Zelofun	what is the problem?
2007-11-04T11:36:00.000Z	sjovan	Zelofun	first... have you updraged or installed 7.10? try sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-new && sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-11-04T11:37:00.000Z	sjovan	Zelofun	k, then just try what i said in the other post
2007-11-04T11:38:00.000Z	sjovan	Zelofun	you don't ahve to restart
2007-11-04T11:38:00.000Z	sjovan	Zelofun	when you have done the command i told you to do, just ctrl+a√∏t+backspace
2007-11-04T11:43:00.000Z	sjovan	Zelofun	so.. does glxgear work after the commands or?
2007-11-04T11:45:00.000Z	Zelofun	sjovan	I execute the commands and so I now have a window with a list of drivers....the only relevant items I can find is nvidia and nv? any sugestion? The choice I have is familiar as I tried bith drivers when restarting ubuntu in the past and was propting me on a dialog for low graphics
2007-11-04T11:47:00.000Z	sjovan	Zelofun	try this first: http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic/
2007-11-04T11:48:00.000Z	sjovan	Zelofun	and then do the commands again, cause the file i told you about is there
2007-11-04T11:53:00.000Z	sjovan	Zelofun	did it work?
2007-11-04T11:57:00.000Z	Zelofun	sjovan	It seems I got lost....i cont... the dialog box after: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg. I seems That recognized my Gcard but now is asking to  should specify the BusID of the video card
2007-11-04T11:58:00.000Z	sjovan	Zelofun	then you have to google up how you can get the busID for your videocard. that i don't know myself sorry
2007-11-04T12:03:00.000Z	Zelofun	sjovan	and zaxius I dis press ctr alt spaceB and I manage to insert the defult bus value (0.0) now is asking:Amount of memory (kB) to be used by the video card
2007-11-04T12:04:00.000Z	sjovan	Zelofun	you could prob. autoconfig the videocard
2007-11-04T12:04:00.000Z	sjovan	Zelofun	try sudo nvidia-xconfig
2007-11-04T12:06:00.000Z	sjovan	Zelofun	k k :)
