2012-01-16T01:19:00.000Z	Iluvalar		I'll repeat : Is it possible that a g++ package that lacked some dependencies installed on my computer could have affected the stability of it ?
2012-01-16T01:21:00.000Z	kop	Iluvalar	anything is possible , I can affect the stability of my computer simply by opening a terminal ...
2012-01-16T01:22:00.000Z	Iluvalar	kop	i mean, could it have compiled some of my core program and cause crashes ?
2012-01-16T01:24:00.000Z	kop	Iluvalar	the real answer is leaving open ended "hooks" that do not output to stdout ie: return failure 0 or error 1 , can hang processes
2012-01-16T01:25:00.000Z	kop	Iluvalar	like ordering soup and having the waiter NOT tell you they are out of soup
2012-01-16T01:26:00.000Z	kop	Iluvalar	taught me to log the output of installation scripts
2012-01-16T01:28:00.000Z	Iluvalar	kop	actually I was updating from 10.10 to 11.04 ...
2012-01-16T01:31:00.000Z	kop	Iluvalar	backup /home (I keep it on a separate partition ) and any other usr configs (xorg ...) and have at it
2012-01-16T01:33:00.000Z	Iluvalar	kop	aff... I have installe dmy computer myself, but i'm not so much comfortable with that...
2012-01-16T01:34:00.000Z	kop	Iluvalar	"importing /home directory after clean install" would be a good place to start
2012-01-16T01:35:00.000Z	Iluvalar	kop	what if i install it on my window 7 partition ?
2012-01-16T01:36:00.000Z	kop	Iluvalar	 umm why ?
2012-01-16T01:36:00.000Z	Iluvalar	kop	i'd be sure i dont crush anything important in the process
2012-01-16T01:37:00.000Z	kop	Iluvalar	 to over simplify I push usrland off to a external usb HD and push it back after install
2012-01-16T01:38:00.000Z	kop	Iluvalar	the difference in file systems for one thing ... NTFS is NOT EXT3-4
2012-01-16T01:39:00.000Z	kop	Iluvalar	correct with the exception of xorg if needed (/etc/X11/xorg.butcher-this)
2012-01-16T01:41:00.000Z	Iluvalar	kop	thank you
2012-01-16T01:43:00.000Z	kop	Iluvalar	my procedure would likely not work for you as I'm several distro's behind and have other quirks such as VM's to move
2012-01-16T01:45:00.000Z	Iluvalar	kop	so if i get a fresh usb install is that ok ?
2012-01-16T01:47:00.000Z	kop	Iluvalar	if your machine recognizes  boot from thumb then sure
2012-01-16T21:37:00.000Z	Iluvalar	kop	thx it worked just fine (11.10 fresh install)
