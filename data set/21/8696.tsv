2007-06-16T10:53:00.000Z	DrkCodeman		at this rate of compilation errors im better off waiting for the package to be released
2007-06-16T10:54:00.000Z	DrkCodeman		/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lXext
2007-06-16T10:54:00.000Z	DrkCodeman		collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
2007-06-16T10:54:00.000Z	DrkCodeman		blah
2007-06-16T10:55:00.000Z	DrkCodeman		x64 compiler is crap :(
2007-06-16T10:56:00.000Z	DrkCodeman		and the latest sources arent working because of distro's compiler here
2007-06-16T10:57:00.000Z	DrkCodeman		not for the latest
2007-06-16T10:57:00.000Z	Frogzoo	DrkCodeman	I have wine 0.9.38 here - after 'sudo apt-get install wine' - just needs the right repo
2007-06-16T10:57:00.000Z	DrkCodeman		atm they only have the sources released for the latest
2007-06-16T10:57:00.000Z	DrkCodeman		so do i
2007-06-16T10:57:00.000Z	DrkCodeman		but it is 39
2007-06-16T10:57:00.000Z	DrkCodeman		try playing source with 38
2007-06-16T10:58:00.000Z	Frogzoo	DrkCodeman	38 is the best you'll do without building it yourself
2007-06-16T10:58:00.000Z	Frogzoo	DrkCodeman	or you could just wait a couple days - they usually update pretty quick
2007-06-16T10:59:00.000Z	DrkCodeman		i hope so :(
2007-06-16T10:59:00.000Z	DrkCodeman		because this compiler here isnt working for crap
2007-06-16T10:59:00.000Z	Frogzoo	DrkCodeman	what's the deal with 39vs 38?
2007-06-16T10:59:00.000Z	DrkCodeman		counter-strike source doesnt function
2007-06-16T11:00:00.000Z	DrkCodeman	brad016	you cant with this crappy compiler for ubuntu
2007-06-16T11:00:00.000Z	DrkCodeman		bunzip2 filename
2007-06-16T11:00:00.000Z	Frogzoo	DrkCodeman	I believe wine routinely builds with gcc, that's not the issue
