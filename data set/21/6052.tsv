2007-07-08T11:58:00.000Z	sirjoebob		?
2007-07-08T11:58:00.000Z	sirjoebob		anyone know how to get office 2003 running in wine?
2007-07-08T12:00:00.000Z	sirjoebob		they said that all documents need to be in word 2003 format. is there any way to add that functionality to the open office in ubuntu?
2007-07-08T12:00:00.000Z	Raffaello	sirjoebob	you should use vmware for office2003
2007-07-08T12:00:00.000Z	sirjoebob		that would probably do all i need
2007-07-08T12:00:00.000Z	Raffaello		or you can use open office
2007-07-08T12:00:00.000Z	sirjoebob		by use vmware, you mean run a virtual desktop of windows, right?
2007-07-08T12:00:00.000Z	Raffaello		when you need office 2003 format, you can save as document at doc format
2007-07-08T12:01:00.000Z	Raffaello		yeah sirjoebob
2007-07-08T12:01:00.000Z	Raffaello		:D
2007-07-08T12:01:00.000Z	Raffaello		I use open office on XP, and I can save as open office document on office format
2007-07-08T12:02:00.000Z	Raffaello		with files > save as
2007-07-08T12:02:00.000Z	Raffaello		Can I use wireless network and local area network at same time on 7.04, if I can, how?
2007-07-08T12:02:00.000Z	sirjoebob		ok. i will try that. if they require me to actually use the office suite, i will use a vm or figure out the wine...
2007-07-08T12:04:00.000Z	sirjoebob		raffaello for using them at the same time, do you mean like "bridge connections" or use them both at the same time so you can get both bandwidths?
2007-07-08T12:05:00.000Z	Raffaello	sirjoebob	I mean use both of them at the same time
2007-07-08T12:06:00.000Z	sirjoebob	Raffaello	i think i understand what you are saying, to "bond" network connections, you could check out this article i found yesterday- it is at www.howtoforge.com/network_card_bonding_centos
2007-07-08T12:07:00.000Z	Raffaello	sirjoebob	thx for your help
2007-07-08T12:07:00.000Z	Raffaello		I'll look that
2007-07-08T12:07:00.000Z	sirjoebob	Raffaello	np. same to you and good luck
