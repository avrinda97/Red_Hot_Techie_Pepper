2006-10-11T15:49:00.000Z	grahamldlw		ok well i dunno how to do that so that aint happening
2006-10-11T15:49:00.000Z	bruenig	grahamldlw	what is the program?
2006-10-11T15:50:00.000Z	bruenig	grahamldlw	lol ok. Bye
2006-10-11T15:56:00.000Z	bruenig	grahamldlw	if you could give us a url of the package, I would be happy to download it and see what is necessary for you to install it
2006-10-11T15:58:00.000Z	bruenig	grahamldlw	ok, go to Applications>Accessories>terminal
2006-10-11T15:59:00.000Z	bruenig	grahamldlw	ok type and then press enter "cd Desktop" or copy and paste
2006-10-11T16:00:00.000Z	bruenig	grahamldlw	all you are going to have to do is copy and paste
2006-10-12T16:01:00.000Z	bruenig	grahamldlw	it's Desktop
2006-10-12T16:03:00.000Z	bruenig	grahamldlw	ok do this "tar jxvf ta3d-v-0-2-1.tar.bz2"
2006-10-12T16:04:00.000Z	bruenig	grahamldlw	you are going to need to install somethings to be able to configure this. "sudo apt-get install build-essential"
2006-10-12T16:08:00.000Z	bruenig	grahamldlw	looking in the readme file, it says there is another dependency you need that I am pretty sure you don't have. Once build-essential downloads and gets installed. Go to System>Administration>Software Properties, once in there click on the first thing, then click add, then check the two unchecked boxes (universe and multiverse).
2006-10-12T16:10:00.000Z	bruenig	grahamldlw	yeah sorry I misinformed you on that last one (not too familiar doing it without command line). You need to click on all of them, then click add and check all of them.
2006-10-12T16:11:00.000Z	bruenig	grahamldlw	ok, well close that go back to the terminal then do "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install liballegro4.2"
2006-10-12T16:12:00.000Z	bruenig	grahamldlw	ok do "cd ~/Desktop/ta3d"
2006-10-12T16:13:00.000Z	bruenig	grahamldlw	now do "sudo ./configure" and pray
2006-10-12T16:15:00.000Z	bruenig	grahamldlw	how is all that going, note the "./configure"
2006-10-12T16:15:00.000Z	bruenig	grahamldlw	did it say everything was configured ok?
2006-10-12T16:16:00.000Z	bruenig	grahamldlw	ok do "make"
2006-10-12T16:18:00.000Z	bruenig	grahamldlw	I don't even have 3d drivers or anything of that sort so at this point I become useless. I can't really see what it is asking for and I don't have any interest to try to install something that I cannot possibly use. Google the errors or see if anyone else in here can help
2006-10-12T16:20:00.000Z	bruenig	grahamldlw	most stuff is much easier than this. You installed build-essential and liballegro the way most things are installed a quick sudo apt-get install whatever. This is source code compilation which is nearly never needed. I haven't compiled anything on this install.
