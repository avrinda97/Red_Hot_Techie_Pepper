2004-11-05T13:36:00.000Z	|progenic|		excuse me, why my totem always show error message and it stated whether to restart application or quit if i'm trying to play some movie ?
2004-11-05T13:37:00.000Z	Treenaks	|progenic|	what kind of movie are you trying to plaY?
2004-11-05T13:38:00.000Z	Treenaks	|progenic|	did you follow the RestrictedFormats howto?
2004-11-05T13:38:00.000Z	Treenaks	|progenic|	(http://wiki.ubuntulinux.org/RestrictedFormats)
2004-11-05T13:39:00.000Z	Treenaks	|progenic|	the wiki is a huge source of information
2004-11-06T14:04:00.000Z	Treenaks	|progenic|	GUI or commandl ine
2004-11-06T14:05:00.000Z	Treenaks	|progenic|	sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade
2004-11-06T14:05:00.000Z	Treenaks	|progenic|	that's the easiest way
2004-11-06T14:05:00.000Z	Treenaks	|progenic|	yes, if you upgrade now, you'll have the latest (= stable) version with all security patches
2004-11-06T14:08:00.000Z	Treenaks	|progenic|	just update/upgrade and it'll be the latest version...
2004-11-07T08:38:00.000Z	Treenaks	|progenic|	the only real, working "download accelerator" is getting a better connection
2004-11-07T08:38:00.000Z	Treenaks	|progenic|	for the rest it's just fake and hype
2004-11-07T08:38:00.000Z	Treenaks	|progenic|	yes, the windows programs just show numbers 10% higher than the "real" numbers..
2004-11-07T08:39:00.000Z	Treenaks	|progenic|	then the server has a limit, for a reason
2004-11-07T08:40:00.000Z	Treenaks	|progenic|	probably better to respect that reason...
2004-12-07T14:36:00.000Z	Treenaks	|progenic|	what are you trying to do? just installing QT won't do anything
2004-12-12T07:05:00.000Z	Treenaks	|progenic|	repeating the same question over and over will not help
2004-12-12T07:05:00.000Z	Treenaks	|progenic|	I don't think here is a solution
2004-12-12T07:05:00.000Z	Treenaks	|progenic|	if there is one, it's in man mount or man fstab
2004-12-12T07:06:00.000Z	Treenaks	|progenic|	really, it might be a mount option
2004-12-12T07:06:00.000Z	Treenaks	|progenic|	check it, please
