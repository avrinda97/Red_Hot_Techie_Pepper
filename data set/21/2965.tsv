2009-06-01T00:08:00.000Z	kumarabhi		anybody can tell me how do i boot my laptop using an iso image?
2009-06-01T00:09:00.000Z	Slart	kumarabhi	burn the iso to a cd.. boot from the cd.. afaik you can't boot from an iso
2009-06-01T00:10:00.000Z	kumarabhi	Slart	my cd rom drive gone bad. cant boot from it
2009-06-01T00:10:00.000Z	Slart	kumarabhi	try booting from an usb stick instead
2009-06-01T00:16:00.000Z	Slart	kumarabhi	ouch... well...you might be able to do something clever by booting off a network.. but that will take a lot of work
2009-06-01T00:17:00.000Z	Slart	kumarabhi	I guess it really depends on how badly you need to boot this iso-file
2009-06-01T00:18:00.000Z	kumarabhi	Slart	so how do i network install ubuntu. pls tell me the best and east link
2009-06-01T00:19:00.000Z	Slart	kumarabhi	there is no "easy" or "good" .. it's just complicated and lots of work
2009-06-01T00:19:00.000Z	Slart	kumarabhi	if I were you I would buy an external usb cd reader and boot from that
2009-06-01T00:20:00.000Z	kumarabhi	Slart	so basicall its booting from usb , right?
2009-06-01T00:21:00.000Z	Slart	kumarabhi	I'm not sure if booting from an usb stick and booting from an usb cd drive is the same
2009-06-01T00:21:00.000Z	kumarabhi	Slart	i think they r the same
2009-06-01T00:21:00.000Z	kumarabhi	Slart	thing is my comp will not check for booting from usb
2009-06-01T00:22:00.000Z	Slart	kumarabhi	hmm.. you could remove the hard drive from the laptop, install ubuntu to it by using another computer, and then put it back
2009-06-01T00:22:00.000Z	kumarabhi	Slart	i already have ubuntu 8.04 on my comp and iso image of 9.04 . so i have grub. i heard that ther is an option to instal ubuntu from grub if i know the location of iso image
2009-06-01T00:22:00.000Z	kumarabhi	Slart	that wud be my last option
2009-06-01T00:23:00.000Z	kumarabhi	Slart	thats how i installed last tiem
2009-06-01T00:23:00.000Z	kumarabhi	Slart	*time
2009-06-01T00:24:00.000Z	Slart	kumarabhi	that's more than I know of.. but it sounds pretty sweet if it's possible
