2006-03-17T06:04:00.000Z	Lani2		I've searched the forums trying to find out how to install MySQL5, but there are references to alot of things that I don't understand and some suggests that I should compile it myself, are there no package for MySQL5?
2006-03-17T06:04:00.000Z	chuckyp	Lani2	there is something about it in the wiki
2006-03-17T06:05:00.000Z	chuckyp	Lani2	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MYSQL5FromSource
2006-03-17T06:05:00.000Z	Lani2	chuckyp	yes, but in the forums they suggest against doing that?
2006-03-17T06:05:00.000Z	chuckyp	Lani2	against doing it from source?
2006-03-17T06:05:00.000Z	chuckyp	Lani2	why?
2006-03-17T06:06:00.000Z	Lani2	chuckyp	because it only has default language encoding and is compiled in with static linking that breaks many stuff and so on
2006-03-17T06:06:00.000Z	chuckyp	Lani2	well then I don't know how else you'd do it unless you find a deb somewhere.
2006-03-17T06:08:00.000Z	chuckyp	Lani2	a deb is just a package that installs the software for you.
2006-03-17T06:09:00.000Z	Lani2	chuckyp	ah ok
2006-03-17T06:11:00.000Z	chuckyp	Lani2	try apt-cache search mysql-server
2006-03-17T06:13:00.000Z	chuckyp	Lani2	when you do a search for mysql-server
2006-03-17T06:13:00.000Z	Lani2	chuckyp	yes
2006-03-17T06:14:00.000Z	chuckyp	Lani2	yeah I don't believe 5 is availible.  unless through a backport for breezy but you may be able to find a deb and install that.
2006-03-17T06:16:00.000Z	Lani2	chuckyp	ok, but drapper drake isn't final? and maybe nothing for a linux newbe to install at this time?
2006-03-17T06:17:00.000Z	chuckyp	Lani2	you can try these but they are not official
2006-03-17T06:18:00.000Z	chuckyp	Lani2	http://packages.dotdeb.org/dists/sarge/mysql-5.0/
2006-03-17T06:18:00.000Z	Lani2	chuckyp	I also just found that page :) so it's safe to install debian packages with ubuntu as ubuntu is derivered from debian?
2006-03-17T06:19:00.000Z	chuckyp	Lani2	Like I said its not official and it won't be supported.  Its kinda enter at your own risk type thing.
