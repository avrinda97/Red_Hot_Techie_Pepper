2007-02-11T09:44:00.000Z	blahblahblah	eontasticness_	lol, sure sure ... i believe you
2007-02-11T09:44:00.000Z	blahblahblah	eontasticness_	it's nice of you to share your knowledge with us tho
2007-02-11T09:45:00.000Z	eontasticness_	blahblahblah	damn! whats with all your freakin questions?
2007-02-11T09:51:00.000Z	blahblahblah	eontasticness_	why does the wife have access to the toys? *hmmm* :)
2007-02-11T09:51:00.000Z	eontasticness_	blahblahblah	well the toys had taken over about every room in the house --- old sparc stations, alpha workstations, 486/mmx/pii/p3 machines, junker laptops
2007-02-11T09:52:00.000Z	blahblahblah	eontasticness_	ehe :) a true junkie
2007-02-11T09:52:00.000Z	eontasticness_	blahblahblah	so now i am down to 16 machines on my lan
2007-02-11T09:52:00.000Z	eontasticness_	blahblahblah	yeah at home --- at work i have about 100 servers
2007-02-11T09:56:00.000Z	blahblahblah	eontasticness_	nifty ... lots of storage there
2007-02-11T09:56:00.000Z	eontasticness_	blahblahblah	 yeah --- i have a bunch of 500gb sata drives in a raid6
2007-02-11T09:56:00.000Z	eontasticness_	blahblahblah	one of them fails and linux freaks out --- pissed me off
2007-02-11T10:05:00.000Z	blahblahblah	eontasticness_	me too, i have a problem with redmonds business practices.  although ubuntu has really changed things, its getting easy to just recommend ubuntu to a home user because it just works
2007-02-11T10:06:00.000Z	eontasticness_	blahblahblah	Ubuntu doesnt "just work" unless the only objective is to have a display and surf the net
2007-02-11T10:07:00.000Z	blahblahblah	eontasticness_	i will haveto disagree with you there
2007-02-11T10:07:00.000Z	eontasticness_	blahblahblah	any ubuntu desktop i install involves 30 minutes to an hour of configuration
