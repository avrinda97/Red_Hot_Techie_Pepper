2005-10-25T07:47:00.000Z	ryanpg		there's no way I can wait 6 months for "the next version"
2005-10-25T07:48:00.000Z	ryanpg		err.. dapper
2005-10-25T07:27:00.000Z	ryanpg		hi all, I found my first ugly ubunut glitch... my USB floppy drive doesn't work at all... dmesg doesn't report a new USB device and the drive doesn't even seem to be getting power, lspci does show the USB bus though... any thoughts on how to fix?
2005-10-25T07:27:00.000Z	carthik	ryanpg	check your BIOS and see if USB is enabled there - happened to me
2005-10-25T07:39:00.000Z	ryanpg	carthik	the USB drive works in gentoo
2005-10-25T07:39:00.000Z	carthik	ryanpg	okay, but did you check the bios settings?
2005-10-25T07:40:00.000Z	ryanpg	carthik	ok I'll reboot and check but I'm 99.9% sure it's fine... I mean why would lspci show the USB bus if it were disabled in bios?
2005-10-25T07:40:00.000Z	carthik	ryanpg	also, ehci_hcd uhci_hcd ohci_hcd all get loaded... you may have luck blacklisting one of more of them in the hotplug blacklist.... first you have to see if there is anything in dmesg regarding the modules being loaded
2005-10-25T07:41:00.000Z	carthik	ryanpg	mine did too, the presense of the pci device does not mean it is being used, though
2005-10-25T07:41:00.000Z	ryanpg	carthik	lsmod usbcore               104188  3 ehci_hcd,uhci_hcd
2005-10-25T07:41:00.000Z	carthik	ryanpg	and you have hal up and running?
2005-10-25T07:43:00.000Z	ryanpg	carthik	hal is running
2005-10-25T07:43:00.000Z	carthik	ryanpg	my ken ends there :)
2005-10-25T07:43:00.000Z	ryanpg	carthik	well thanks for helping
2005-10-25T07:43:00.000Z	carthik	ryanpg	you could file a bug report if nothing works out in the end
2005-10-25T07:44:00.000Z	carthik	ryanpg	my empathy's with you
2005-10-25T07:45:00.000Z	carthik	ryanpg	yes, udev is used
2005-10-25T07:45:00.000Z	carthik	ryanpg	i had similar probs on a dell machine once
2005-10-25T07:45:00.000Z	carthik	ryanpg	a reinstall or upgrade fixed it for me then
2005-10-25T07:45:00.000Z	ryanpg	carthik	well I sure don't want to do a reinstall
2005-10-25T07:46:00.000Z	carthik	ryanpg	not that i want you to try it - was just saying what had happend to me :)
