2007-06-19T12:35:00.000Z	niuq		hello, i am trying to transfer files with gftp but it's to slow and appears a message "transfer stalled", not sure what it means
2007-06-19T12:35:00.000Z	niuq		any help?
2007-06-19T12:17:00.000Z	niuq		can you tell me a ftp server besides gftp (im having problems with it)
2007-06-19T12:18:00.000Z	KjetilK	niuq	I use twoftpd
2007-06-19T12:19:00.000Z	niuq		Kjetilk: its terminal or it has gui?
2007-06-19T12:19:00.000Z	niuq		!twoftpd
2007-06-19T12:21:00.000Z	KjetilK	niuq	it is just a very simple server, I think it uses debconf for configuration, but I can't even remember setting it up
2007-06-19T12:22:00.000Z	niuq		Kjetilk: maybe you could help me with the one im using now
2007-06-19T12:23:00.000Z	niuq		Kjetilk: my transfers get stalled very often, like every 10 seconds
