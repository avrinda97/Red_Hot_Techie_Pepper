2006-07-18T06:01:00.000Z	Silk_Fear	ardchoille	okay, but I dont get it..
2006-07-18T06:06:00.000Z	ardchoille	Silk_Fear	You can use: sudo <command>    does that help?
2006-07-18T06:07:00.000Z	Silk_Fear	ardchoille	yes, but where do I use it?
2006-07-18T06:07:00.000Z	ardchoille	Silk_Fear	You use sudo for any app that requires admin privs.. ex: sudo firestarter . it will ask for a password, you use your user password, not the root password.
2006-07-18T06:08:00.000Z	ardchoille	Silk_Fear	use sudo in a terminal
2006-07-18T06:08:00.000Z	Silk_Fear	ardchoille	okay.. let's see if I can do this, brb
2006-07-18T06:10:00.000Z	Silk_Fear	ardchoille	I kinda tried.. it doesn't work
2006-07-18T06:10:00.000Z	ardchoille	Silk_Fear	open a term and type:  sudo updatedb
2006-07-18T06:11:00.000Z	ardchoille	Silk_Fear	That updates the slocate database and may take a few minutes, but it is an example of using sudo
2006-07-18T06:11:00.000Z	Silk_Fear	ardchoille	and put in my password?
2006-07-18T06:11:00.000Z	ardchoille	Silk_Fear	yes, your user password
2006-07-18T06:11:00.000Z	Silk_Fear	ardchoille	okay, one minute
2006-07-18T06:12:00.000Z	Silk_Fear	ardchoille	"amalea is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported."
2006-07-18T06:12:00.000Z	ardchoille	Silk_Fear	Are you the one who installed Ubuntu on that computer?
2006-07-18T06:13:00.000Z	Silk_Fear	ardchoille	no, I mentioned before, I bought this from value village.. there was a previous user. But I know the password for that user. Shall I try that?
2006-07-18T06:13:00.000Z	ardchoille	Silk_Fear	I would say yes, try that user, that user may be the administrator for that box
