2008-04-16T17:20:00.000Z	jake2point0	NoTownKasper	ok im there
2008-04-16T17:20:00.000Z	NoTownKasper	jake2point0	Appearances tab, right under cube color and above skydone.
2008-04-16T17:21:00.000Z	jake2point0	NoTownKasper	i got a browse button next to the string blank.
2008-04-16T17:22:00.000Z	NoTownKasper		...
2008-04-16T17:22:00.000Z	jake2point0	NoTownKasper	looks like a folder
2008-04-16T17:22:00.000Z	jake2point0	NoTownKasper	 do you see it now?
2008-04-16T17:22:00.000Z	NoTownKasper	jake2point0	I know what the browse button looks like. :P I have one for cube background...but it's not there next to the cubecap. Maybe I've got a package missing that I need?
2008-04-16T17:23:00.000Z	jake2point0	NoTownKasper	am i looking in wrong place?
2008-04-16T17:23:00.000Z	NoTownKasper	jake2point0	If I knew how to send you a screenshot, I would. but I think you're in the right place.
2008-04-16T17:24:00.000Z	NoTownKasper	jake2point0	I think the problem is on my end.
2008-04-16T17:24:00.000Z	jake2point0	NoTownKasper	i see what you mean now...
2008-04-16T17:24:00.000Z	jake2point0	NoTownKasper	no i see it now... the cubecaps dont have a browse button like the one above has.
2008-04-16T17:24:00.000Z	NoTownKasper	jake2point0	Exactly my problem. :\
2008-04-16T17:25:00.000Z	NoTownKasper	jake2point0	And if I try to insert a path to the image file, it doesn't error or anything, it just does nothing. Like I never gave it a value in the first place.
2008-04-16T17:25:00.000Z	jake2point0	NoTownKasper	google it.  thats what im doing.
2008-04-16T17:26:00.000Z	NoTownKasper	jake2point0	I have been, for the last 4 hours. I've scoured the ubuntu forums, and even gone over a few compiz specific sites. Nothing. Closest I could come across was this goof on the ubuntu forums looking for the default instalation folder for the default cube cap.
2008-04-16T17:28:00.000Z	NoTownKasper	jake2point0	I'd post on the forums myself, but the hope is that I'll have this done in the next 3 hours. :\ I have to return this box to it's owner for payment. :P Dude's paying me to configure it.
2008-04-16T17:28:00.000Z	jake2point0	NoTownKasper	im sorry.  im joining the compiz-fusion room
