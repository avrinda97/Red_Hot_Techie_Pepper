2007-12-03T04:36:00.000Z	NoobSauce		I'm trying to get ubuntu to work on my box, I've installed everything, and then it fails to start the X-server. Specifically it gives an error VESA(0): No matching modes, Screen(s) found, but none have a usable configuration. I've searched online, and it looks like this was a bug report filed with a previous version (I've done a dist-upgrade from FF). I'm out of ideas on how to resolve this issue... Any clues?
2007-12-03T04:38:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	NoobSauce	i would run this command sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg  and take generic defaults for everything(use Vesa for video, not ati/nvidia), then once you get a GUI, work on fixing everything right.
2007-12-03T04:39:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	NoobSauce	you'll have to do that in safe mode(one of your grub menu entries)
2007-12-03T04:47:00.000Z	NoobSauce	IndyGunFreak	Yeah, I would think that this would work as well, and I don't think it's a hardware failure since the device has previously worked...
2007-12-03T04:44:00.000Z	NoobSauce	IndyGunFreak	I've already tried to reconfigure x. I've looked up the refresh rates and other monitor specs on the web, and I've filled those values in. I'm editing the xorg.conf manually, so safe mode is not necessary (?)
2007-12-03T04:45:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	NoobSauce	ok, i would just do everything generic, and see if you can get X to start.
2007-12-03T04:45:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	NoobSauce	do everything generic, and you will likely get everything to start.
2007-12-03T04:45:00.000Z	NoobSauce	IndyGunFreak	so I tried that as well, and I couldn't get anything... is this a known issue or something? The bug report that I found indicates that is was resolved?
2007-12-03T04:46:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	NoobSauce	no, onlyu thing i know, is you're doing something wrong.. what did you choose when it asked for your video device?
2007-12-03T04:46:00.000Z	NoobSauce	IndyGunFreak	video device was chosen as vesa since I don't have a video card in here anyways
2007-12-03T04:47:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	NoobSauce	you're doing something jacked up,c uz if you use generic defaults, X should start, barring some other hardware problem
2007-12-03T04:47:00.000Z	NoobSauce	IndyGunFreak	oh, and the monitor is a Sceptre X7-Agama. The default is not correct, so I set the horizontal refresh rate to the correct value, and still no X...
2007-12-03T04:47:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	NoobSauce	sigh.. you just don't get it... i give up
2007-12-03T04:48:00.000Z	NoobSauce	IndyGunFreak	I've already tried the defaults, and set it to vesa with no luck... What am I not getting?
2007-12-03T04:48:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	NoobSauce	nothing... good luck with it.
2007-12-03T05:02:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	NoobSauce	very wierd...
2007-12-03T05:02:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	NoobSauce	i'd have never thought that, so you're using an onboard device now, right?
2007-12-03T05:03:00.000Z	NoobSauce	IndyGunFreak	Well, yeah. There's on-board video which I guess I'm using now, and then there's this HDMI card that comes with the motherboard (it's not a regular card, it has a feed directly off the motherboard as well as PCI). I'm thinking this non-normal setup is what's causing linux to get confuzzled
2007-12-03T05:03:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	NoobSauce	sounds it.
2007-12-03T05:04:00.000Z	NoobSauce	IndyGunFreak	I don't want to rub it in, but as you can see, I actually wasn't doing anything wrong :) Don't be so quick to assume
2007-12-03T05:04:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	NoobSauce	lol
