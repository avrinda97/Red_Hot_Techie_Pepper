2009-02-24T02:38:00.000Z	m4rk		how do I fix my dependencies in xubuntu? whenever I try to install anything, it tells me I have unmet dependencies :( should I try sudo apt-get dist-upgrade?
2009-02-24T02:38:00.000Z	Bodsda	m4rk	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
2009-02-24T02:39:00.000Z	m4rk	Bodsda	thanks. I will try that :D
2009-02-24T02:47:00.000Z	m4rk	Bodsda	it says E: Unable to fetch some archives, maybe run apt-get update or try with --fix-missing?   :(
2009-02-24T02:48:00.000Z	Bodsda	m4rk	so try    sudo apt-get update --fix-missing
2009-02-24T02:50:00.000Z	m4rk	Bodsda	I still get a whole lot of 404 commands. I might need an up-to-date sources.list
2009-02-24T02:50:00.000Z	Bodsda	m4rk	can you pastebin your sources.list please
2009-02-24T02:53:00.000Z	m4rk	Bodsda	sources.list at http://pastebin.com/d5f7703a2
2009-02-24T02:53:00.000Z	Bodsda	m4rk	what country do you live in?
2009-02-24T02:53:00.000Z	m4rk	Bodsda	UK
2009-02-24T02:54:00.000Z	Bodsda	m4rk	ok, try this one -- http://pastebin.com/m56fd5704
2009-02-24T02:54:00.000Z	Bodsda	m4rk	also you may want to think about upgrading to hardy
2009-02-24T03:04:00.000Z	m4rk	Bodsda	hmm..that doesn't seem to have fixed it...still getting the same behaviour
2009-02-24T03:04:00.000Z	Bodsda	m4rk	can you pastebin the error please
2009-02-24T03:09:00.000Z	m4rk	Bodsda	actually mate, --fix-missing seems to be doing something different this time. So perhaps it is working (it's still chugging away)! :)
2009-02-24T03:10:00.000Z	Bodsda	m4rk	good stuff :)
2009-02-24T03:11:00.000Z	m4rk	Bodsda	so how do I upgrade my installation?
2009-02-24T03:12:00.000Z	Bodsda	m4rk	sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2009-02-24T03:12:00.000Z	m4rk	Bodsda	OK. fingers crossed!
2009-02-24T03:12:00.000Z	Bodsda	m4rk	have fun :)
