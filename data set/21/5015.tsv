2008-01-13T21:20:00.000Z	joshwaryan		does anyone have a link that explains how to manually add drivers using the console (I may have to add drivers for a wireless card)
2008-01-13T21:20:00.000Z	android6011	joshwaryan	it depends on what driver
2008-01-13T21:21:00.000Z	joshwaryan		in this case, it's a driver for a Ralink wireless card attached to a PCI slot
2008-01-13T21:22:00.000Z	android6011	joshwaryan	you do you know what chipset specifically?
2008-01-13T21:24:00.000Z	joshwaryan	android6011	intel 845
2008-01-13T21:25:00.000Z	android6011		joshwryan i mean ralink chipset
2008-01-13T21:26:00.000Z	joshwaryan	android6011	the version of the card is EW-7128g
2008-01-13T21:26:00.000Z	joshwaryan	android6011	does that help?
2008-01-13T21:26:00.000Z	android6011		ya hang on ill check for you
2008-01-13T21:27:00.000Z	joshwaryan	android6011	the card worked under the desktop version, but not the server version
2008-01-13T21:29:00.000Z	joshwaryan	android6011	meaning the desktop version installed automatically, but the server version apparently needs a manual install
2008-01-13T21:30:00.000Z	android6011	joshwaryan	thats weird
2008-01-13T21:31:00.000Z	joshwaryan	android6011	tell me about it! I actually re-installed a 2nd time thinking something went wrong, but I got the same result
2008-01-13T21:33:00.000Z	android6011		ok you are going to want to download the rt61 hourly at http://rt2x00.serialmonkey.com/wiki/index.php/Downloads
2008-01-13T21:34:00.000Z	android6011	joshwaryan	and then when you extract there will be a readme basically you are just gonna want to do a ./configure then make then make install
2008-01-13T21:35:00.000Z	android6011		and if you have problems connecting, on that link there is  a graphical connect utility and you should try that
2008-01-13T21:38:00.000Z	joshwaryan	android6011	ok, I will give it a shot...can I ask you another quick question? I want to install GUI under server...I tried sudo apt-install ubuntu-desktop but it said the package did not exist...should I get my internet working first and then download gnome or does it exist under a different name?
2008-01-13T21:39:00.000Z	android6011	joshwaryan	id worry about getting it to work first
2008-01-13T21:39:00.000Z	android6011		then worry about connecting
2008-01-13T21:39:00.000Z	joshwaryan	android6011	ok, thanks for your help
2008-01-13T21:40:00.000Z	android6011	joshwaryan	np. ive done ralink drivers a million times its either gonna go real easy or things are gonna go bad so good luck
