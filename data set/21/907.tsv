2011-04-23T00:03:00.000Z	juv1228		it works in windows tho
2011-04-23T00:05:00.000Z	juv1228		and im on the netbook version, so i need most of the depends aswell
2011-04-23T00:06:00.000Z	juv1228		which is my big problem, because i need to manually follow all the links on the ubuntu site for all these pkg's
2011-04-23T00:08:00.000Z	juv1228		dkms and bcmwl-kernel-source plus their entire depends tree
2011-04-23T00:09:00.000Z	juv1228		is there any way to have apt download the entire depend tree, even if its installed?
2011-04-23T00:09:00.000Z	juv1228		then maybe somone could tar it up for me?
2011-04-23T00:11:00.000Z	juv1228		if they were just in a txt file or something that would be fine, i can write a python script or somthin to grab em
2011-04-23T00:13:00.000Z	juv1228		ok, whatever you got is good
2011-04-23T00:13:00.000Z	juv1228		beats manually finding all this
2011-04-23T00:14:00.000Z	juv1228		thanks a bunch Galeon
2011-04-23T00:14:00.000Z	carandraug	juv1228	I think you can do it with synaptic though I'm not sure
2011-04-23T00:15:00.000Z	juv1228	carandraug	i have no clue, but either way i would need to have someone else do it for me as i dont have access to a linux pc with internet
2011-04-23T00:15:00.000Z	carandraug	juv1228	go to the computer that needs to install the package and mark it for installation. All the dependencies will be marked automatically for installation. Then there's an option to save the marked packages in a file.
2011-04-23T00:16:00.000Z	juv1228	carandraug	oh, for real? that sounds like it might work.
2011-04-23T00:17:00.000Z	carandraug	juv1228	even better. On synaptic there's a "generate download package script" option
2011-04-23T00:18:00.000Z	carandraug	juv1228	here's how to do it. Go to the computer without internet. Open synaptic. Choose the package you want to install and select "Mark for installation". All the dependencies will be marked. Go to the File menu and choose "Generate package download script". Voila
2011-04-23T00:21:00.000Z	juv1228	carandraug	ill try that now, gunna have to reboot and DC but ill be back either way
2011-04-23T00:28:00.000Z	juv1228	carandraug	didnt work
2011-04-23T00:28:00.000Z	carandraug	juv1228	why not?
2011-04-23T00:29:00.000Z	carandraug	juv1228	if you need to update the list of packages first to generate the script, there's a way to create a mirror of the list to a USB stick and update from there
2011-04-23T00:31:00.000Z	carandraug	juv1228	tried this? http://www.planetoss.com/detail.php?id=13
