2009-04-25T13:35:00.000Z	Szaboka		so can anyone help me installing oss?
2009-04-25T13:35:00.000Z	LordKow	Szaboka	why would you want to?
2009-04-25T13:41:00.000Z	Szaboka	LordKow	can u help me reinstalling my normal alsa audio drivers?
2009-04-25T13:41:00.000Z	Szaboka	LordKow	when i plug in my headphone or external sound system in my laptop, the lappy's speakers are still operational, and i got some info here on irc to install oss instead of alsa
2009-04-25T13:42:00.000Z	LordKow	Szaboka	um... how did the alsa drivers get uninstalled?
2009-04-25T13:43:00.000Z	Szaboka	LordKow	i think i blacklisted it in some file...
2009-04-25T13:45:00.000Z	LordKow	Szaboka	well, there are numerous files that could blacklist the alsa drivers. it's likely one of them in /etc/modprobe.d.
2009-04-25T13:45:00.000Z	Szaboka	LordKow	i'll have a try
2009-04-25T13:46:00.000Z	Szaboka	LordKow	this is a folder, right, how can I edit the textfile that blacklists the driver?
2009-04-25T13:47:00.000Z	LordKow	Szaboka	alt+f2 then 'gksu gedit </folder/info/filename.whatever>' no < or >
2009-04-25T13:48:00.000Z	Szaboka	LordKow	sorry i dont exactly understand
2009-04-25T13:48:00.000Z	Szaboka	LordKow	i edited a file but a dont exactly know its name and where it was
2009-04-25T13:48:00.000Z	Szaboka	LordKow	somewhere in /etc
2009-04-25T13:48:00.000Z	LordKow	Szaboka	i can't help you find it
2009-04-25T13:49:00.000Z	LordKow	Szaboka	try pastebin'ing 'fgrep -R 'alsa' /etc/modprobe.d/*' that might help me help you find it
2009-04-25T13:51:00.000Z	Szaboka	LordKow	okay there was the blacklist file, and I got rid of the "blacklist alsa" text from it
2009-04-25T13:52:00.000Z	LordKow	Szaboka	after that you will need to reboot so it reloads the alsa drivers
2009-04-25T13:52:00.000Z	Szaboka	LordKow	okay brb in a minute thanks
2009-04-25T13:56:00.000Z	Szaboka	LordKow	i still have no sound
2009-04-25T13:57:00.000Z	LordKow	Szaboka	check the volume levels in the volume bar in the notification icon area
2009-04-25T13:58:00.000Z	Szaboka	LordKow	my driver is pluseaudio null output currently (and still)
