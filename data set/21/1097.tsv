2011-02-02T08:43:00.000Z	xil		okay serious problem. I shutdown my computer in order to move locations, everything was fine. I go to boot up and Grub runs into a problem. It can't find any deviced hd1, which is where Ubuntu is stored aparently. I have a Wubi install if that matters. Really need to fix this
2011-02-02T08:44:00.000Z	cvandal	xil	Did you install Ubuntu through windows?
2011-02-02T08:44:00.000Z	xil	cvandal	yes
2011-02-02T08:46:00.000Z	cvandal	xil	Nevermind, you just said wubi. You'll want to use your recovery CD, open a command prompt and use bootrec.exe /fmb.
2011-02-02T08:47:00.000Z	xil	cvandal	your used of .exe tells me this is a windows recovery CD?
2011-02-02T08:48:00.000Z	cvandal	xil	Yes. Based on the use of wubi.exe, windows is your main OS I'm guessing.
2011-02-02T08:48:00.000Z	xil	cvandal	not by choice, but yes
2011-02-02T08:49:00.000Z	cvandal	xil	Haha, no worries. Same boat. Nearly died when this error popped up for me.
2011-02-02T08:50:00.000Z	xil	cvandal	my heart went through the floor. I know that some of the Win7 recovery stuff is different from older versions of Windows, do you know that this will work for Win7?
2011-02-02T08:50:00.000Z	cvandal	xil	I myself am running win7 premium and it did the trick flawlessly.
2011-02-02T08:52:00.000Z	xil	cvandal	awesome, thank you. Clarification though, I pop in the Win7 disk, boot from it, load the recovery console and then put bootrec.exe /fmb
2011-02-02T08:54:00.000Z	cvandal	xil	That is correct. /fmb literally stands for fix master boot. What happened was grub modified it during the update. There is a way to do it with the LiveCD as well, but I can't speak to it really. I didn't go that route because I wasn't 100% certain if it would break the windows boot record further.
2011-02-02T08:55:00.000Z	xil	cvandal	when grub modified it during the update....what update? I've been using wmii so I haven't been running Ubuntu updates. Are you aware of grub doing things on it's own?
2011-02-02T08:57:00.000Z	cvandal	xil	No, but the update for 10.04 has the option for grub and it seems many (like myself) installed it not realizing it would cause issues with the boot record.
2011-02-02T08:59:00.000Z	cvandal	xil	Clarification bootrec.exe /fixmbr
2011-02-02T08:59:00.000Z	cvandal	xil	Sorry, been a long day. :)
2011-02-02T08:59:00.000Z	xil	cvandal	interesting...I need to figure out more about why this happened, but at least I have a solution....for now, haha. I'll try it out soon. Need my computer to definitely work for the next little while while I finish some stuff up. Thanks a LOT. If you're still around later you might find out if it worked, or didn't
2011-02-02T09:00:00.000Z	cvandal	xil	Best of luck, let me know if that works out for you. Saved my life today.
2011-02-02T09:00:00.000Z	xil	cvandal	hey I'm just glad you knew the answer. Long day shmong day. It was nice enough that you were willing to help
2011-02-02T09:00:00.000Z	xil	cvandal	will do, haha
2011-02-02T09:12:00.000Z	xil	cvandal	of all the things, I don't think my Win7 disk is here and I don't have a spare burnable disk on me =[. I don't know when I'll be able to actually run the recovery ;_;
