2009-06-10T17:08:00.000Z	roxanna		Can I install Ubuntu Netbook Remix on any laptop? Or is it strictly for netbooks?
2009-06-10T17:08:00.000Z	indus	roxanna	good question , the netbook is also a laptop
2009-06-10T17:10:00.000Z	roxanna	indus	yes it is... so then why do they call netbooks netbooks instead of laptops?
2009-06-10T17:10:00.000Z	indus	roxanna	marketing nonsense
2009-06-10T17:10:00.000Z	roxanna	indus	haha
2009-06-10T17:10:00.000Z	indus	roxanna	but wait let me double check
2009-06-10T17:11:00.000Z	roxanna	indus	so can I install netbook remix on 'regular' laptops not designated as 'netbook's
2009-06-10T17:11:00.000Z	indus	roxanna	wait 1 moment iam checking what a netbook is :)
2009-06-10T17:12:00.000Z	indus	roxanna	tell me what you have
2009-06-10T17:12:00.000Z	roxanna	indus	i have a HP Pavilion dv1000 (pretty old but still alive)
2009-06-10T17:13:00.000Z	indus	roxanna	is that a netbook?
2009-06-10T17:13:00.000Z	roxanna	indus	i am currently running xubuntu on it...
2009-06-10T17:13:00.000Z	roxanna	indus	nope, not a netbook
2009-06-10T17:15:00.000Z	indus	roxanna	ok i dont recommend installing it
2009-06-10T17:15:00.000Z	indus	roxanna	the unr is optimised for newer power saving chips in netbooks so it may not work correctly on urs
2009-06-10T17:16:00.000Z	indus	roxanna	which os did your netbook come wwith?
2009-06-10T17:17:00.000Z	indus	roxanna	netbook remix should work well on that mini
2009-06-10T17:17:00.000Z	roxanna	indus	my netbook came with windows xp pro sp3 initially but i recently installed UNR because it started lagging too much.. yeah UNR works way better than the os pre installed
2009-06-10T17:17:00.000Z	indus	roxanna	and now you want to try it on the old hp? am i right?
2009-06-10T17:18:00.000Z	indus	roxanna	if it has 512 mb ram its worth a try i think :)
2009-06-10T17:19:00.000Z	indus	roxanna	i wonder whether it can be installed on a desktop :P
