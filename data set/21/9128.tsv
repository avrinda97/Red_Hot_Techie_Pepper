2005-11-27T09:57:00.000Z	redondos	lgc	what do you want to know? perhaps I can help you
2005-11-27T09:59:00.000Z	lgc	redondos	the problem is that after a while (sometimes a short, sometimes a long while) the wireless link from my laptop goes dead.
2005-11-27T10:00:00.000Z	redondos	lgc	does this happen with other wireless devices connected to your access point?
2005-11-27T10:01:00.000Z	lgc	redondos	the laptop is  the only wireless item around
2005-11-27T10:01:00.000Z	redondos	lgc	I'd -as a prevention method- blame the access point for now, until it is proven contrary.
2005-11-27T10:02:00.000Z	redondos	lgc	so go get a friend's laptop and see if it happens.
2005-11-27T10:02:00.000Z	lgc	redondos	but how can I prove that?
2005-11-27T10:02:00.000Z	redondos	lgc	^ that way ^
2005-11-27T10:02:00.000Z	lgc	redondos	thab
2005-11-27T10:03:00.000Z	redondos	lgc	in fact, if it really is that you could feel lucky, since it's the less-headaching problem
2005-11-27T10:03:00.000Z	lgc	redondos	oops! thanks. I do get an IPW2200 fatal error at boot time. And it usually takes forever at the "configuring network interfaces" step.
2005-11-27T10:04:00.000Z	redondos	lgc	ah, well.. what error?
2005-11-27T10:05:00.000Z	lgc	redondos	it says something like "starting dump log" or whatever. Do you know where to look for these kind of logs?
2005-11-27T10:06:00.000Z	redondos	lgc	less /var/log/messages
2005-11-27T10:07:00.000Z	lgc	redondos	thanks. With "dmesg" it says it found a duplicate address. However, the thing is still operational (while it is operational, that is), as you can see.
2005-11-27T10:14:00.000Z	lgc	redondos	I only get "Detected Intel PRO/Wireless 2200BG Network Connection"
2005-11-27T10:25:00.000Z	lgc	redondos	I see you're tired, but can you at least tell me how can I bring the wireless link up again (ifupdown eth1 restart doesn't seem to work)?
2005-11-27T10:29:00.000Z	redondos	lgc	how did you manage to get it down? try /etc/init.d/networking restart
2005-11-27T10:31:00.000Z	lgc	redondos	thanks. I mean that when the link goes dead "ifupdown" doesn't help.
2005-11-27T10:32:00.000Z	lgc	redondos	 thanks a lot for now. That'll do, but there's a lot more to ask the experts later. 'Later!
2005-11-27T10:32:00.000Z	redondos	lgc	yw. later :)
