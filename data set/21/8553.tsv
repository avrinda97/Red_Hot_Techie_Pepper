2007-01-21T10:35:00.000Z	wastrel		why f
2007-01-21T10:35:00.000Z	wastrel		why do you tell them to use f
2007-01-21T10:35:00.000Z	wastrel		it is not necessary and generally not helpful to use f
2007-01-21T10:36:00.000Z	wastrel		don't make a habit of using f
2007-01-21T10:36:00.000Z	wastrel		use f if you need it
2007-01-21T10:36:00.000Z	jmoncayo	wastrel	well its better than being typing yes like 300 times
2007-01-21T10:36:00.000Z	jmoncayo		np
2007-01-21T10:36:00.000Z	jmoncayo		force and recursive
2007-01-21T10:36:00.000Z	wastrel	jmoncayo	 given that he wants to copy a folder, i assume the destination doesn't yet exist.
2007-01-21T10:37:00.000Z	wastrel		so you wouldn't have to type yes ever
2007-01-21T10:37:00.000Z	wastrel		if the destination does exist, perhaps he has made a mistake and would not want to blow away the existing data there
2007-01-21T10:37:00.000Z	jmoncayo	wastrel	well its good to know the f i you overwriting stuff
2007-01-21T10:37:00.000Z	wastrel		telling newbies to use -f is dangerous for the newbie
2007-01-21T10:38:00.000Z	wastrel		love your newbies!  do not hurt them!
