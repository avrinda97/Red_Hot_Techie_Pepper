2012-04-11T22:15:00.000Z	trism	HelenB	that sounds like bug 877440 see comment #11 for a workaround that works for me
2012-04-11T22:27:00.000Z	trism	HelenB	did you try the workaround in the comment in the bug I posted above? (device pair/unpair). Also seems to be fixed in 12.04
2012-04-11T22:36:00.000Z	trism	HelenB	that is gnome 3 fallback mode, not gnome 2
2012-04-11T22:36:00.000Z	HelenB	trism	Huh?
2012-04-11T22:36:00.000Z	trism	HelenB	it is the gnome panel ported to gnome 3
2012-04-11T22:36:00.000Z	trism	HelenB	well gtk3 that is
2012-04-11T22:43:00.000Z	trism	HelenB	one last time, this is a bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libplist/+bug/877440 it is fixed in precise but not oneiric
2012-04-11T22:44:00.000Z	trism	HelenB	there is also a workaround listed in that bug by installing libimobiledevice-utils and using idevicepair unpair && idevicepair pair;
2012-04-11T22:45:00.000Z	HelenB	trism	Like I said ealier
2012-04-11T22:46:00.000Z	trism	HelenB	there is only one package, libimobiledevice-utils, it is in universe
2012-04-11T22:46:00.000Z	HelenB	trism	but I need idevicepair and unpair
2012-04-11T22:47:00.000Z	trism	HelenB	those are in libimobiledevice-utils
2012-04-11T22:47:00.000Z	trism	HelenB	those are the commands you run in a terminal after installing
2012-04-11T22:48:00.000Z	HelenB	trism	I ran the commands but still unable to mount the device.
2012-04-11T22:49:00.000Z	trism	HelenB	after the pair/unpair you should be able to click the device in nautilus and it will mount (it worked for me anyway)
2012-04-11T22:49:00.000Z	HelenB	trism	wait...
2012-04-11T22:49:00.000Z	trism	HelenB	otherwise you may need to wait for the fixed version in 12.04 when it comes out later this month
2012-04-11T22:50:00.000Z	trism	HelenB	unpair then pair, sorry
2012-04-11T22:50:00.000Z	trism	HelenB	yes you are right, I typed it in the wrong order
2012-04-11T22:51:00.000Z	HelenB	trism	wont mount.
2012-04-11T22:51:00.000Z	trism	HelenB	I was when I had the problem I am not now, some later comments suggest unplugging and replugging after the unpair/pair
