2006-07-04T10:31:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy		hmm
2006-07-04T10:32:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy		so, the kororaa livecd works, X-wise
2006-07-04T10:32:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy		but ubuntu doesn't
2006-07-04T10:33:00.000Z	george_looney	BHSPitLappy	do a text only install and configure the X Window system later
2006-07-04T10:35:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	george_looney	we -have- a text-only install
2006-07-04T10:36:00.000Z	george_looney	BHSPitLappy	ooops, must have been the beer
2006-07-04T10:36:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	george_looney	I didn't say it, but we do have a text-only install. the alternate install cd created it
2006-07-04T10:36:00.000Z	george_looney	BHSPitLappy	I meant the beer joke on me :)
2006-07-04T10:37:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	george_looney	and I just told you I didn't say it to begin with
2006-07-04T10:37:00.000Z	george_looney	BHSPitLappy	ok So I'm still in my senses :)
2006-07-04T10:38:00.000Z	george_looney	BHSPitLappy	get into a root session with "sudo -i"
2006-07-04T10:38:00.000Z	george_looney	BHSPitLappy	then "apt-get install x-window-system-core"
2006-07-04T10:39:00.000Z	george_looney	BHSPitLappy	Have already installed?
2006-07-04T10:39:00.000Z	george_looney	BHSPitLappy	Have you already installed ?
2006-07-04T10:40:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	george_looney	we have a text-only install, but I think it's crippled.
2006-07-04T10:41:00.000Z	george_looney	BHSPitLappy	crippled!? like how?
2006-07-04T10:42:00.000Z	george_looney	BHSPitLappy	oh ok, so I guess you can at least login in the text mode
2006-07-04T10:43:00.000Z	george_looney	BHSPitLappy	now give this "apt-get install x-window-system-core"
2006-07-04T10:43:00.000Z	george_looney	BHSPitLappy	tell me what it says?
2006-07-04T10:46:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	george_looney	it seems to be working, using the cd
2006-07-04T10:46:00.000Z	george_looney	BHSPitLappy	you are welcome
