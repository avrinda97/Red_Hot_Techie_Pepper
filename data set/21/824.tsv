2011-05-24T20:17:00.000Z	ampharos		anybody know about the xubuntu installer crashing pre-install?
2011-05-24T20:17:00.000Z	ampharos		It's crashed on verifying
2011-05-24T20:19:00.000Z	ampharos		It's a Python ValueError about arch
2011-05-24T20:19:00.000Z	ampharos		I don't want to commit to ubuntu on that PC
2011-05-24T20:20:00.000Z	ampharos		the CD drive is slow and it has low ram
2011-05-24T20:20:00.000Z	ampharos		it's happened a different PC with the same variant of onboard GFX
2011-05-24T20:20:00.000Z	ampharos		so this is not specific to my PC
2011-05-24T20:21:00.000Z	ampharos		i also don't want to burn a disc, and partition: I just need to test out an installed environment without partitioning: and this is what wubi should be letting me do
2011-05-24T20:22:00.000Z	Caboose885	ampharos	Do you have a USB thumbdrive? You could try it that way. Or Virtualbox
2011-05-24T20:23:00.000Z	Caboose885	ampharos	how old is the computer
2011-05-24T20:23:00.000Z	Caboose885	ampharos	hmmm. Do you have a spare HD you could swap in it? :D
2011-05-24T20:24:00.000Z	Caboose885	ampharos	hmmm tricky situation
2011-05-24T20:25:00.000Z	Caboose885	ampharos	Are you sure that its not listing your thumbdrive under the hard drives of the BIOS?
2011-05-24T20:26:00.000Z	ampharos	Caboose885	I actually do want to install to the HD, just not as a partition, but loopback disk image
2011-05-24T20:26:00.000Z	Caboose885	ampharos	I had a laptop from 2001 that listed a thumbdrive as a hard drive so thats how I had to boot it
2011-05-24T20:27:00.000Z	Caboose885	ampharos	I know but if you can boot off the thumbdrive then you could install xubuntu to the thumbdrive
2011-05-24T20:27:00.000Z	Caboose885	ampharos	are you running windows xp?
2011-05-24T20:28:00.000Z	Caboose885	ampharos	system specs?
2011-05-24T20:30:00.000Z	Caboose885	ampharos	what exactly happens when you try and install it via wubi?
2011-05-24T20:33:00.000Z	Caboose885	ampharos	I'm afraid your hardware just might not let you
2011-05-24T20:34:00.000Z	Caboose885	ampharos	good choice, If it doesn't work well you might want to try Lubuntu
