2010-07-07T10:40:00.000Z	lewis1711	neodragon	check to see catalyst actually supports that card. I suspect it doesn't
2010-07-07T10:41:00.000Z	neodragon	lewis1711	already checked, it does not support that card anymore
2010-07-07T10:41:00.000Z	lewis1711	neodragon	looks like the radeon or radeonhd driver is your only choice now
2010-07-07T10:42:00.000Z	neodragon	lewis1711	so how to I enable that driver for the install CD for 10.04?
2010-07-07T10:43:00.000Z	lewis1711	neodragon	should be auto enabled
2010-07-07T10:44:00.000Z	neodragon	lewis1711	for some reason the CD gets to the Ubuntu logo with the progress dots and then the screen just goes blank and nothing else happens period
2010-07-07T10:45:00.000Z	lewis1711	neodragon	huh. that's crap. I am going to figure out how to get ubuntu to display messages when it boots instead of just using splashscreens, as I am wanting to do that for myself.
2010-07-07T10:46:00.000Z	lewis1711	neodragon	then hopefully you'll get some kind of message when you boot that you can work off.
2010-07-07T10:46:00.000Z	neodragon	lewis1711	that would a great step in getting 10.04 on this laptop
2010-07-07T10:47:00.000Z	lewis1711	neodragon	oh is this for the live CD?
2010-07-07T10:47:00.000Z	neodragon	lewis1711	yes
2010-07-07T10:49:00.000Z	lewis1711	neodragon	http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=2803726&postcount=2 this looks like it
2010-07-07T10:50:00.000Z	neodragon	lewis1711	thanks I will take a look
2010-07-07T10:50:00.000Z	lewis1711	neodragon	ok, this version of ubuntu doesn't have a menu.lst. hmm. things have changed:P
2010-07-07T10:52:00.000Z	neodragon	lewis1711	not only that, but I don't think that will work with the liveCD only on an installed system
2010-07-07T10:53:00.000Z	lewis1711	neodragon	oh yeah I forgot. huh, how old is your system?
2010-07-07T10:57:00.000Z	neodragon	lewis1711	it's an HP Compaq nc8430 with intel centrino duo CPU, 2GB RAM, ATI Radeon x1600 256MB graphics, intel pro wireless 3945ABG card. It's about 4 years old I think

2010-07-07T11:01:00.000Z	lewis1711	neodragon	right, and you install the CD and it just freezes? hmm. do check that the disk has no errors
2010-07-07T11:04:00.000Z	neodragon	lewis1711	for the help I will test the disk and if neseccary, download and burn a new one
2010-07-07T11:05:00.000Z	neodragon	lewis1711	that's the thing I've never had trouble with ubuntu before on this laptop, weird
