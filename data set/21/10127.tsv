2005-05-06T07:41:00.000Z	SaMRoX`		hi, i have a problem: I must use 60hz becouse of my monitor but gnome doesnt mantein that setting every time I restart.. how can i solve it?
2005-05-06T07:41:00.000Z	dcraven	SaMRoX`	you can set your refresh rates in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2005-05-06T07:42:00.000Z	dcraven	SaMRoX`	no sweat, look for HorizSync and VertRefresh in the "Monitor" section in that file. It's pretty straight forward.
2005-05-06T07:45:00.000Z	SaMRoX`	dcraven	another problem, I don't have xorg.conf :S
2005-05-06T07:45:00.000Z	dcraven	SaMRoX`	are you running Warty?
2005-05-06T07:46:00.000Z	SaMRoX`	dcraven	Im a newbie at linux, dont know whats Warty, I just installed Ubuntu and nothing else
2005-05-06T07:47:00.000Z	dcraven	SaMRoX`	do you have a /etc/X11/XF86Config file?
2005-05-06T07:47:00.000Z	dcraven	SaMRoX`	yeah, welcome aboard :)
2005-05-06T07:47:00.000Z	SaMRoX`	dcraven	yes
2005-05-06T07:48:00.000Z	dcraven	SaMRoX`	sounds like you are running Warty then, that is the old release. If you have a broadband connection, I'd advise upgrading to Hoary (released a couple of weeks ago, and stable).
2005-05-06T07:49:00.000Z	dcraven	SaMRoX`	oh my.
2005-05-06T07:50:00.000Z	dcraven	SaMRoX`	okay, well for your problem it makes no difference. The instruction I gave before still holds, only the file is called XF86Config. The syntax/content is identical to the xorg.conf file I mentioned.
2005-05-06T07:51:00.000Z	dcraven	SaMRoX`	your call. You could upgrade to Hoary (recommended), or stay with the older version. Your current problem (60Hz Monitor) can be fixed either way, but other things will probably work better with the newer version.
2005-05-06T07:58:00.000Z	dcraven	SaMRoX`	I imagine it's the VertRefresh one you want to set to 60.
2005-05-06T07:59:00.000Z	SaMRoX`	dcraven	you are right
2005-05-06T08:00:00.000Z	dcraven	SaMRoX`	I suppose. I doubt it *requires* a range, but if it does, and you want to peg it at 60, then do 60-60 or something.
2005-05-06T08:00:00.000Z	dcraven	SaMRoX`	I think a single value would be fine though.
2005-05-06T08:01:00.000Z	dcraven	SaMRoX`	Myrtti says it may need a range, so 60-61 or something will be fine.
2005-05-06T08:04:00.000Z	dcraven	SaMRoX`	you need to edit as a priveliged user.. "sudo gedit /etc/X11/XF86Config", then enter your password when it asks.
2005-05-06T08:07:00.000Z	SaMRoX`	dcraven	do you know how could i login as root in the login screen? the installation didnt ask me for a password for root
2005-05-06T08:08:00.000Z	dcraven	SaMRoX`	you can't. root is disabled in Ubuntu. When you use "sudo", you type in your user password.
