2004-12-15T17:28:00.000Z	flam		is there a simple way of editing which daemons to autostart with ubuntu(like portmap and inetd) or do I have to edit the init.d files manually?
2004-12-15T17:28:00.000Z	ogra	flam	manually
2004-12-15T17:28:00.000Z	flam	ogra	ok. i can't seem to find which file that starts them tho :P
2004-12-15T17:29:00.000Z	flam		i'll just have to search harder.
2004-12-15T17:30:00.000Z	ogra	flam	/etc/rc2.d holds all the initscripts for the default runlevel.....if you want the full functionallity of your desktop you dont want to disable portmap
2004-12-15T17:30:00.000Z	flam	ogra	hm. portmap is only used for nfs-shares, or am i wrong?
2004-12-15T17:31:00.000Z	ogra	flam	remove or add the symlinks in the rc2.d to start or stop the services on boot
2004-12-15T17:31:00.000Z	ogra	flam	 fam needs portmap
2004-12-15T17:31:00.000Z	flam		ah, ok.
2004-12-15T17:31:00.000Z	flam		then i'll let it stay.
2004-12-15T17:31:00.000Z	flam		thanks for your help
2004-12-15T17:31:00.000Z	ogra	flam	portmap on ubuntu is configured to listen only local so dont worry
2004-12-15T17:32:00.000Z	flam	ogra	i wasn't worried about that. i'm secure. i just don't want a lot of daemons runnings and take up space in mem :)
2004-12-15T17:33:00.000Z	flam		i can't understand why almost 500 mb of my memory i used..
2004-12-15T17:33:00.000Z	flam		512
2004-12-15T17:34:00.000Z	flam		yeah i know. but i just have like 8 mb free right now :P
2004-12-15T17:34:00.000Z	flam		guess it keeps it at that level
2004-12-15T17:34:00.000Z	flam		ok..? :)
2004-12-15T17:35:00.000Z	ogra	flam	thats great ...as long as the system doesnt swap you should be happy that your mem gets used ;)
2004-12-15T17:35:00.000Z	flam		i get 311
2004-12-15T17:36:00.000Z	ogra	flam	much less then 512 :)
