2010-06-08T23:40:00.000Z	the_file		how big are the performance differences between ubuntu netbook and desktop?.
2010-06-08T23:40:00.000Z	the_file		Im thinking of using ubuntu desktop for a netbook
2010-06-08T23:40:00.000Z	the_file		and does ubuntu netbootk version allow for compiz effects plugin?.
2010-06-08T23:42:00.000Z	soreau	the_file	If it's not intel, probably yes (for compiz)
2010-06-08T23:42:00.000Z	soreau	the_file	intel gpus have been blacklisted for compiz due to driver issues
2010-06-08T23:42:00.000Z	the_file	soreau	I preffer amd =)
2010-06-08T23:43:00.000Z	the_file	soreau	amd is a great powerhouse for 3d shit
2010-06-08T23:43:00.000Z	soreau	the_file	Excellent. But does this netbook have an ati card?
2010-06-08T23:43:00.000Z	the_file	soreau	oww I am still shopping for a netbook
2010-06-08T23:43:00.000Z	soreau	the_file	you'll want to watch your language here
2010-06-08T23:43:00.000Z	soreau	the_file	But amd/ati is a great choice IMHO
2010-06-08T23:43:00.000Z	the_file	soreau	yep amd/ait is my favorite pair
2010-06-08T23:46:00.000Z	the_file	soreau	amd is great for 3d and will probably work great for compiz plugin
2010-06-08T23:46:00.000Z	soreau	the_file	Yes, it will. The open driver is great and also you have option of fglrx for HD ati cards
2010-06-08T23:47:00.000Z	soreau	the_file	AFAIK, compiz works on UNR but you might want to make sure
2010-06-08T23:48:00.000Z	the_file	soreau	does compiz plugin with the 3d box and all come default in ubuntu or do u got to install it thru the software center?.
2010-06-08T23:49:00.000Z	soreau	the_file	cube is part of core, but ubuntu stopped installing compiz-plugins-extra by default (mostly unrelated to cube)
2010-06-08T23:49:00.000Z	soreau	the_file	So yes, cube comes installed by default but you'll want ccsm to config it
2010-06-08T23:49:00.000Z	the_file	soreau	wow I didn't know that
2010-06-08T23:50:00.000Z	the_file	soreau	very impressive
2010-06-23T10:56:00.000Z	soreau	the_file	Yes. use ccsm>Preferences>Export/Import
