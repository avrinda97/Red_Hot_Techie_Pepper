2011-06-24T03:40:00.000Z	afeijo		I removed compiz, it toke away the ubuntu-desktop, now I can do nothing with my machine!

2011-06-24T03:40:00.000Z	afeijo		first, what is the command to open the terminal?
2011-06-24T03:41:00.000Z	bazhang	afeijo	ctrl alt T
2011-06-24T03:41:00.000Z	afeijo	bazhang	no
2011-06-24T03:41:00.000Z	bazhang	afeijo	you mean tty?
2011-06-24T03:41:00.000Z	bazhang	afeijo	then say so
2011-06-24T03:42:00.000Z	afeijo	bazhang	I dont call it tty
2011-07-16T09:03:00.000Z	bazhang	afeijo	clone?
2011-07-16T09:03:00.000Z	afeijo	bazhang	yes
2011-07-16T09:03:00.000Z	bazhang	afeijo	/msg ubottu clone   or perhaps clonezilla
2011-07-16T09:03:00.000Z	bazhang	afeijo	no
2011-07-16T09:04:00.000Z	bazhang	afeijo	its a clone, so it will copy everything
2011-07-16T09:05:00.000Z	afeijo	bazhang	here what ubottu sent me "To replicate your packages selection on another machine (or restore it if re-installing)"
2011-07-16T09:06:00.000Z	bazhang	afeijo	yes, thats different than clonezilla , which I also said
2011-07-16T09:06:00.000Z	afeijo	bazhang	ubottu knows nothing about clonezilla
2011-07-16T09:06:00.000Z	bazhang	afeijo	thats right, go to their website
2011-07-16T09:08:00.000Z	afeijo	bazhang	nice, I will test it
2011-07-16T09:08:00.000Z	afeijo	bazhang	I will purchase another 1 tb HD, not the same model, no problem right?
2011-07-16T09:08:00.000Z	bazhang	afeijo	how can I guarantee that? thats hardware so no idea
