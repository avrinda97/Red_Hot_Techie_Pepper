2008-07-31T20:19:00.000Z	geirha	Johnny	are you trying to do the same as "tail -f ~/compile" ?
2008-07-31T20:21:00.000Z	geirha	Johnny	ah, hehe, while true;do cat ~/compile;sleep $((RANDOM/8192));done
2008-07-31T20:24:00.000Z	geirha	Johnny	cat file1 file2
2008-07-31T20:26:00.000Z	geirha	Johnny	why not download some source, and have the script recompile it over and over again instead? then you're actually compiling something too
2008-07-31T20:27:00.000Z	geirha	Johnny	apt-get source packagename   will download the source of a give package to the directory you are in. Pick a package at random.
2008-07-31T20:28:00.000Z	geirha	Johnny	yes, but it will look realistic. And you can run it with low priority so it doesn't use up cpu
2008-07-31T20:30:00.000Z	geirha	Johnny	I don't know, maybe coreutils, it's a lot of small programs.
2008-07-31T20:43:00.000Z	geirha	Johnny	try this http://paste.ubuntu.com/32639/
2008-07-31T23:33:00.000Z	geirha	Johnny	Yes, set it to start in 2-3 minutes. What's your time?
2008-07-31T23:34:00.000Z	geirha	Johnny	37 12 * * *  DISPLAY=0:0 zenity --notification --text="hello"
2008-07-31T23:34:00.000Z	geirha	Johnny	should make it pop up at 12:37
2008-07-31T23:37:00.000Z	geirha	Johnny	sorry, It should be DISPLAY=:0  not 0:0
2008-07-31T23:39:00.000Z	geirha	Johnny	0 11 * * 3 DISPLAY=:0 zenity --notification --text="GET READY"
