2010-12-18T08:13:00.000Z	loquitus	DasEi	as in, I should stop using VMWare?
2010-12-18T08:11:00.000Z	DasEi	loquitus	after that it does
2010-12-18T08:12:00.000Z	loquitus	DasEi	I did both those commands
2010-12-18T08:12:00.000Z	DasEi	loquitus	and then get the deb from vbox and install
2010-12-18T08:12:00.000Z	loquitus	DasEi	sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)-dev
2010-12-18T08:13:00.000Z	DasEi	loquitus	cut the -dev
2010-12-18T08:13:00.000Z	DasEi	loquitus	then install vbox
2010-12-18T08:14:00.000Z	DasEi	loquitus	oh vmware, I read virtualbox, anyway.. if you missed some pre's got to reinstall, either or :
2010-12-18T08:15:00.000Z	DasEi	loquitus	sudo apt-get -f install
2010-12-18T08:15:00.000Z	loquitus	DasEi	what does that -f install do?
2010-12-18T08:15:00.000Z	loquitus	DasEi	Did that command, btw. DIdn't do anyuthing
2010-12-18T08:15:00.000Z	DasEi	loquitus	haven't tried vmware on maverick yet, but player was fine in lucid , so I doubt trouble in maverick
2010-12-18T08:18:00.000Z	DasEi	loquitus	seem trouble : http://tinyurl.com/2an93bd,  which kernel ?
2010-12-18T08:18:00.000Z	loquitus	DasEi	2.6.35-24-generic #42-Ubuntu SMP
2010-12-18T08:19:00.000Z	DasEi	loquitus	seems having issues, as you see in the forum
2010-12-18T08:19:00.000Z	loquitus	DasEi	VMware really sucks. Every time I do an upgrade, the damn thing breaks.
2010-12-18T08:22:00.000Z	DasEi	loquitus	on your very own risk, as I don't know the source : http://tinyurl.com/2dg4tzl
2010-12-18T08:26:00.000Z	DasEi	loquitus	 If there is no certain need for vmware, use vbox, it's fine
2010-12-18T08:26:00.000Z	DasEi	loquitus	 I guess they will fix their installer later on
2010-12-18T08:28:00.000Z	DasEi	loquitus	also can convert vmdk to vdi
