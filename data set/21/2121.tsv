2010-02-05T23:38:00.000Z	daftykins	CAPcap	try right clicking a jpeg, selecting properties, then on the properties window check the list of apps on the 'open with' tab?
2010-02-05T23:39:00.000Z	CAPcap	daftykins	there is no open with tab, thats why I'm asking
2010-02-05T23:39:00.000Z	daftykins	CAPcap	ah weird, are you on karmic?

2010-02-06T00:26:00.000Z	daftykins	CAPcap	drivers don't work like windows, they're still there - it's just whatever driver is being told to be used that gets used
2010-02-06T00:27:00.000Z	CAPcap	daftykins	 so if it screws everything up because my card isnt supported properly is it possible to switch back 'easily'?
2010-02-06T00:28:00.000Z	daftykins	CAPcap	/etc/X11/xorg.conf is what usually defines what driver is in use. if X epically fails, you'll want to delete that file so it reverts to standard. because by installing ATI proprietary one of the steps will be forcing the driver in that config to the new one
2010-02-06T00:29:00.000Z	daftykins	CAPcap	so you could just log in at CLI and delete it
2010-02-06T00:29:00.000Z	daftykins	CAPcap	after backing up of course ;)
2010-02-06T00:30:00.000Z	CAPcap	daftykins	surge_, you just lost me entirely sorry. Ubuntu n00b. Linux n00b.
