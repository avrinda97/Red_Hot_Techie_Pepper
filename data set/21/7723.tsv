2006-07-28T08:52:00.000Z	FusionXN1		flan - cheers ill read that
2006-07-28T08:52:00.000Z	FusionXN1		Well i want to convert to FAT32 so i can be safe
2006-07-28T08:53:00.000Z	FusionXN1		Is there anyway to convert it?
2006-07-28T08:54:00.000Z	FusionXN1		flan so I CANT convert?
2006-07-28T08:54:00.000Z	FusionXN1		Yes it has my work on it
2006-07-28T08:55:00.000Z	Warbo	FusionXN1	You want to convert it to make writing safe, but converting it is unsafe as well, so either way you are screwed
2006-07-28T08:57:00.000Z	Warbo	FusionXN1	"lsmod | grep nvidia" and "cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf | grep nvidia"
2006-07-28T10:45:00.000Z	Warbo	FusionXN1	Were you giving it a type?
2006-07-28T10:45:00.000Z	FusionXN1	Warbo	i formatted and have tried EXT3 and FAT32 it wont open
2006-07-28T10:46:00.000Z	Warbo	FusionXN1	Well "sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sdb1" and "sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt" should work
2006-07-28T10:47:00.000Z	Warbo	FusionXN1	mount doesn't say anything when it has worked
2006-07-28T10:48:00.000Z	Warbo	FusionXN1	I'm not about drive labels
2006-07-28T10:49:00.000Z	Warbo	FusionXN1	Drives can have labels, which is their name. If you mean changing it from /mnt then just unmount it with sudo umount /mnt then mount it somewhere else
2006-07-28T10:50:00.000Z	FusionXN1	Warbo	its "weird" it says its a windows NTFS yet gparted says it FAT32
2006-07-28T10:51:00.000Z	Warbo	FusionXN1	partition types and their actual filesystems can often be different
2006-07-28T10:51:00.000Z	FusionXN1	Warbo	but it wont remount again now it says inaccessable
2006-07-28T10:51:00.000Z	Warbo	FusionXN1	You used sudo umount?
2006-07-28T11:11:00.000Z	FusionXN1	Warbo	how do i save it?
