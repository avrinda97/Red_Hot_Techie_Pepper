2008-01-13T04:55:00.000Z	olskolirc		hello.  what is the commandline for moving a user to another group please?
2008-01-13T04:56:00.000Z	jrib	olskolirc	see 'man adduser'.  I'm not sure what you mean by "move"
2008-05-26T22:25:00.000Z	jrib	olskolirc	what are you compiling?
2008-05-26T22:26:00.000Z	jrib	olskolirc	quicktime is in the repositories, no need to compile
2008-05-26T22:27:00.000Z	jrib	olskolirc	show me the second life documentation that tells you you need quicktime
2008-05-26T22:28:00.000Z	jrib	olskolirc	I can only help you if you answer my questions... the quicktime in the repositories is the same as what you are trying to compile
2008-05-26T22:29:00.000Z	jrib	olskolirc	yes, that is why I want you to show the document that tells you what you need
2008-11-08T04:35:00.000Z	jrib	olskolirc	it is there in preferences...
2008-11-08T04:34:00.000Z	jrib	olskolirc	right click on the time applet in your panel and go to preferences
2008-11-08T04:36:00.000Z	jrib	olskolirc	note that I said "preferences" and you said "adjust date and time"
