2010-05-30T18:03:00.000Z	wieshka	Vilemaxim	i recommend to do backups before installing other OS if you are not sure what you are doing :)
2010-05-30T18:04:00.000Z	Vilemaxim	wieshka	I recommend doing backups even if you are
2010-05-30T18:04:00.000Z	wieshka	Vilemaxim	aha :) i prefer clonezilla for full backups, duplicity for incremental backups :)
2010-05-30T18:05:00.000Z	Vilemaxim	wieshka	clonezilla don't do anything special for failing drives.... right?
2010-05-30T18:06:00.000Z	wieshka	Vilemaxim	they are so many options - i supouse that there is way for failing drives also

2010-05-30T18:07:00.000Z	Vilemaxim	wieshka	I run a repair shop and I've tried a bunch of solutions... including clonezilla,but myrescue worked out the best for me.
2010-05-30T18:07:00.000Z	Vilemaxim	wieshka	though I'm always willing to learn something new :)
2010-05-30T18:08:00.000Z	wieshka	Vilemaxim	in my case i use clonezilla for daily use - i have a good number of technicaly identical computers and i am setting on them OS with clonezilla
2010-05-30T18:10:00.000Z	Vilemaxim	wieshka	yeah... clonezilla seems cool. I'm been waiting to play with it a little more for the your kinds situation.
2010-05-30T18:11:00.000Z	wieshka	Vilemaxim	the best solution - set up clonezilla server :)

2010-05-30T18:14:00.000Z	wieshka	Vilemaxim	for my situation the ebst choise is clonezilla
2010-05-30T18:15:00.000Z	Vilemaxim	wieshka	I've been trying to work out... What do you do to maintain apps?
