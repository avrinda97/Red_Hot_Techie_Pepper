2008-03-06T01:37:00.000Z	hischild		is it possible to tunnel all internet traffic through ssh?
2008-03-06T01:37:00.000Z	xarquid	hischild	yes, like vpn?
2008-03-06T01:38:00.000Z	hischild	xarquid	yes.
2008-03-06T01:38:00.000Z	xarquid	hischild	yep. would you like a good how to? :)
2008-03-06T01:38:00.000Z	hischild	xarquid	that'd be great ;-)

2008-03-06T01:40:00.000Z	hischild	xarquid	thanks  .. i'll look into those
2008-03-06T01:42:00.000Z	hischild	xarquid	just two questions .... does it still connect on the default ssh port when forwarding a different port? and can i forward an entire range this way as well?
2008-03-06T01:43:00.000Z	xarquid	hischild	I have never seen SSH handle all ports (I.E. SSH act like VPN though)...
2008-03-06T01:43:00.000Z	hischild	xarquid	more like, say i want to forward the ports 2500-2800 ... could i do that the same way?
2008-03-06T01:44:00.000Z	xarquid	hischild	So tunneling through SSH can't really handle ALL traffic...I think there is some software that uses SSH encryption (like blowfish) that uses the libraries to achieve the same thing...but VPN software is what does what you are referring to, I guess (forwarding ALL traffic...). That's why it is slower and most prefer SSH tunneling, because it just forwards one specific port or specified port ranges instead of -all- traffic.
2008-03-06T01:44:00.000Z	xarquid	hischild	Now that is definitely something more suitable for ssh. Single ports or port ranges are good for ssh :)
2008-03-06T01:45:00.000Z	xarquid	hischild	VPN is better for ALL traffic...but it's slow...SSH tunneling is made for port forwarding and encrypted tunnels between locations.
2008-03-06T01:46:00.000Z	hischild	xarquid	it doesnt have to forward all traffic ... for the love of god, please not (there's some srs downloading being done on his end) ... but i can, instead of just a single port, specify a range?
2008-03-06T01:47:00.000Z	xarquid	hischild	yes, you can specify a port range
2008-03-06T01:48:00.000Z	xarquid	hischild	I.E. 6000 > 6010 or as you said that would work as well. So yes.
2008-03-06T01:48:00.000Z	hischild	xarquid	then that's exactly what i need ... tnx :-) I'll probably come around with more questions, but for now ... thanks!
2008-03-06T01:48:00.000Z	xarquid	hischild	Sorry for delving into VPN, I got off topic with another question ;p Have a good one.
2008-03-06T01:49:00.000Z	hischild	xarquid	no problem. vpn is a bit to slow for what i'm trying to achieve here (forward game traffic without creating a huge delay)
2008-03-06T01:49:00.000Z	xarquid	hischild	Then SSH tunneling/forwarding is perfect :-)
2008-03-06T01:50:00.000Z	hischild	xarquid	yeah =) trying it out now
