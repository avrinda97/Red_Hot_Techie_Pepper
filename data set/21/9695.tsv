2005-07-30T16:40:00.000Z	Amaranth	catolh	Sorry, I don't know.
2005-07-30T16:41:00.000Z	catolh	Amaranth	so im basically screwed? :o
2005-07-30T16:41:00.000Z	Amaranth	catolh	man mount :)
2005-07-30T16:41:00.000Z	Amaranth	catolh	I don't remember how to use mount, I haven't had to since I got ubuntu. :)
2005-07-30T16:43:00.000Z	catolh	Amaranth	well.. my problem is that ive already installed ubuntu..and tried to use a splash image with grub.. and then it got borked, only funky letters in startup and it just stops.. so im using my Live CD now, trying to get access to my local hdd to again edit my /boot/grub/menu.lst .. to remove the splashimage. Think its possible? Cause i really need to get it done.. I dont want to reinstall Ubuntu
2005-08-11T05:29:00.000Z	Amaranth	catolh	not really
2005-08-11T05:29:00.000Z	catolh	Amaranth	so i need to use enlightenment?

2005-08-11T05:29:00.000Z	catolh	Amaranth	is it possible to use engage with E16?
2005-08-11T05:29:00.000Z	Amaranth	catolh	I don't use enlightenment
