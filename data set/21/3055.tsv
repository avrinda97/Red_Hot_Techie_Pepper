2009-04-25T06:47:00.000Z	jschall		anyone have an epson stylus NX105 working? considering buying one
2009-04-25T06:47:00.000Z	A3K	jschall	I use the N300 and it works well
2009-04-25T06:48:00.000Z	A3K		I dont think my problem is a major one, I just don't know how to fix it
2009-04-25T06:49:00.000Z	jschall		there are about 4-5 printers in my house. not a single one of them works with ubuntu.
2009-04-25T06:49:00.000Z	A3K	jschall	name one of your printers
2009-04-25T06:50:00.000Z	A3K		even a cheap laser like the brother HL2140 works well
2009-04-25T06:50:00.000Z	A3K		I am UnknownGurl
2009-04-25T06:50:00.000Z	A3K		my sound works - startup sounds and test device, but applications will not work
2009-04-25T06:51:00.000Z	A3K		Eternal Lands crashes when I try to change settings
2009-04-25T06:51:00.000Z	jschall	A3K	well there's an ancient xerox which is a winprinter
2009-04-25T06:51:00.000Z	A3K	jschall	model number?
2009-04-25T06:51:00.000Z	jschall	A3K	and then there's an oki color laser that doesn't work
2009-04-25T06:52:00.000Z	jschall	A3K	don't remember, i can go look though. it's listed as a paperweight on openprinting
2009-04-25T06:52:00.000Z	A3K		that would be an indicator it doesnt work.
2009-04-25T06:52:00.000Z	jschall	A3K	duh.
2009-04-25T06:52:00.000Z	A3K		a lot of old printers dont work with windows though...CUPS and Gutenprint support a TON of printers
2009-04-25T06:53:00.000Z	A3K		anyone have any ideas on my audio problem? Sound works but not with applications
2009-04-25T06:53:00.000Z	jschall	A3K	why can't there just be one single standard protocol for talking to printers?
2009-04-25T06:53:00.000Z	A3K	jschall	ask the manufacturers... :/
2009-04-25T06:54:00.000Z	A3K		sfz I will look again
2009-04-25T06:54:00.000Z	jschall	A3K	the manufacturers are dumb.
