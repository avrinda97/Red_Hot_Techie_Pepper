2007-06-10T08:36:00.000Z	Zemus		What's a single command for adding user "george" to the sudoers list, logged in as root?
2007-06-10T08:38:00.000Z	jrib	Zemus	you can just add the user to the "sudoers" group
2007-06-10T08:38:00.000Z	jrib	Zemus	you can just add the user to the "admin" group, ignore my last comment...
2007-06-10T08:40:00.000Z	Zemus	jrib	right, but I'm not sure. It has to be a single command, like what nerdygirl said. :P
2007-06-10T08:40:00.000Z	jrib	Zemus	sudo adduser george admin
2007-06-10T08:41:00.000Z	jrib	Zemus	no, in the "admin" group.  The "admin" group has sudo privileges in /etc/sudoers by default
2007-06-10T08:43:00.000Z	Zemus	jrib	thanks :)
2007-06-10T08:43:00.000Z	jrib	Zemus	np
2007-09-04T05:55:00.000Z	Zemus	jrib	thank you :)
2007-09-04T05:55:00.000Z	Zemus	jrib	I already looked there, but thanks ;)
2007-09-04T05:58:00.000Z	jrib	Zemus	is there a reason you aren't using the ubuntu packages?
2007-09-04T05:58:00.000Z	Zemus	jrib	I guess I was just trying to learn to compile something from source.
2007-09-04T05:59:00.000Z	jrib	Zemus	you should probably pick something with a ./configure script eh?
2007-09-04T05:59:00.000Z	Zemus	jrib	I guess so, eh? Lol
2007-09-04T05:59:00.000Z	Zemus	jrib	hehehe. So if I'm going to run ./configure, there should be a file in the directory called 'configure', or what? I really appreciate your help, btw. :)
2007-09-04T06:00:00.000Z	jrib	Zemus	yes, there should be a file called 'configure' to run ./configure
2007-09-04T06:00:00.000Z	Zemus	jrib	ahhh. See, now we know... hahaha. Thanks!
2007-09-04T06:00:00.000Z	Zemus	jrib	the readme says you don't need to configure, that you can just make. Odd, huh?
2007-09-04T06:00:00.000Z	Zemus	jrib	you might try downloading the tarball and checking it out for yourself, if you're curious. *shrug* :)
2007-09-16T06:32:00.000Z	jrib	Zemus	somewhere in ~/.mozilla/firefox/PROFILE_DIRECTORY
2007-09-16T06:33:00.000Z	Zemus	jrib	I looked there, there w
