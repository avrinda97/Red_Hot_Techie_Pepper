2005-07-01T16:28:00.000Z	tekk		Alright, another question, I'm trying to run a file in the terminal, the terminal opens but then quickly closes out. Any suggestions on fixing this?
2005-07-01T16:30:00.000Z	tekk		No answers? :(
2005-07-01T05:50:00.000Z	tekk		Can someone help me please?
2005-07-01T05:51:00.000Z	nalioth	tekk	i missed your question
2005-07-01T08:49:00.000Z	nalioth	tekk	are you writing IN the terminal or in the 'run appliation' box?
2005-07-01T08:50:00.000Z	tekk	nalioth	im using the 'run application' box
2005-07-01T08:50:00.000Z	nalioth	tekk	shell scripts should be run in a terminal window
2005-07-01T08:51:00.000Z	tekk	nalioth	okay, just to make sure, the command to run a python script is py scriptname.py correct?
2005-07-01T08:51:00.000Z	nalioth	tekk	blahblah.py yes
2005-07-01T08:52:00.000Z	tekk	nalioth	because that has not been working for me :(
2005-07-01T08:52:00.000Z	nalioth	tekk	do you have the correct python interpreter installed?
2005-07-01T08:53:00.000Z	tekk	nalioth	Python 2.4.1 (#2, Mar 30 2005, 21:51:10)
2005-07-01T08:53:00.000Z	tekk	nalioth	thats what it says when i start the interpreter
2005-07-01T08:53:00.000Z	nalioth	tekk	there are several versions of python
2005-07-01T08:54:00.000Z	tekk	nalioth	read my copy/paste its 2.4.1, the one that came with ubuntu already installed
2005-07-01T08:54:00.000Z	nalioth	tekk	but perhaps your .py depends on a nother version
2005-07-01T08:54:00.000Z	tekk	nalioth	i created this file myself today
2005-07-01T08:55:00.000Z	nalioth	tekk	i know next to nothing about python, other than i have several versions installed right now
2005-07-01T08:56:00.000Z	tekk	nalioth	sigh...alright can you point me in a direction i should go for help?
2005-07-01T08:56:00.000Z	nalioth	tekk	ask uncle google, cuz i'm not a python man
2005-07-01T08:57:00.000Z	tekk	nalioth	uncle google has already been asked, but thanks for the trying anyway..
