2011-02-04T09:53:00.000Z	heslam		hey guys. what happens if you accidentally copy a file into a directory like
2011-02-04T09:53:00.000Z	heslam		cp foo.dat /etc/bar
2011-02-04T09:53:00.000Z	heslam		what happens to the /etc/bar directory?
2011-02-04T09:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	heslam	not much, if the file exists and you copy over it, it could cause issues. Writing to folders outside $HOME will require sudo
2011-02-04T09:56:00.000Z	heslam	ActionParsnip	i was using sudo, yeah - thankfully i don't think it overwrote anything though
2011-02-04T09:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	heslam	you can check with:  dpkg -S filename
2011-02-04T09:58:00.000Z	heslam	ActionParsnip	it says file not found, so i must've done something wrong anyway :P i can't even get my commands wrong properly
2011-02-04T09:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	heslam	if it wasnt found then its not part of a package :D, all is well
2011-02-04T09:59:00.000Z	heslam	ActionParsnip	excellent, thanks ;)
2011-02-04T10:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	heslam	rc.local will run as root before the login screen shows
2011-02-04T10:38:00.000Z	heslam	ActionParsnip	so that's not the one i want, then... i'm trying to get synergy (a screen sharing-esque tool) to run but i don't think having it before the login is appropriate
2011-02-04T10:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	heslam	then add it in the startup apps in the applications -> preferences (or admin, not sure0
2011-02-04T10:40:00.000Z	heslam	ActionParsnip	ah, okay, thanks. i was hoping for a command line way but i'll hunt for the program
2011-02-04T10:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	heslam	you can create a .desktop file in ~/.config/autostart   and it will run in any DE
2011-07-07T21:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	heslam	xorg will give the gui and use the nvidia driver, so you will have both
2011-07-07T21:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	heslam	what is the output of: lsb_release -d
2011-07-07T21:47:00.000Z	heslam	ActionParsnip	whoops! didn't see you reply
2011-07-07T21:48:00.000Z	heslam	ActionParsnip	lsb_release -d gives me 11.04 :P
2011-07-07T21:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	heslam	are there any bugs reported?
2011-10-24T22:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	heslam	you can create .desktop files and drag them to dash.
2011-10-24T22:32:00.000Z	heslam	ActionParsnip	cool, thanks. i'll look into that. seems like the kind of thing that should be possible for 12.04 though - dragging from firefox URL to launcher and the website favicon used as an icon. :)
