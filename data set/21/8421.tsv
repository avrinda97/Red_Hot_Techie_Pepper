2006-04-09T06:51:00.000Z	_jason	cowboyfeng	did you finish the guide?
2006-04-09T06:51:00.000Z	_jason	cowboyfeng	ok, what happens now when you try to start firefox?
2006-04-09T06:51:00.000Z	_jason	cowboyfeng	open up a terminal and type 'firefox', what does it say?
2006-04-09T06:52:00.000Z	_jason	cowboyfeng	how about '/opt/firefox/firefox' ?
2006-04-09T06:53:00.000Z	_jason	cowboyfeng	are your intentions to revert to firefox 1.07 or to complete the upgrade to 1.5?
2006-04-09T06:53:00.000Z	_jason	cowboyfeng	ok, what does the '/opt/firefox/firefox' command do then?
2006-04-09T06:57:00.000Z	_jason	cowboyfeng	ok, run >>  dpkg-divert --list '*firefox*'  << and put it up on pastebin please, then give me a link ( http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ )

2006-04-09T07:01:00.000Z	cowboyfeng	_jason	should those be reversed
2006-04-09T07:01:00.000Z	_jason	cowboyfeng	 sudo ln -s /opt/firefox/firefox /usr/bin/firefox  <-- do that
2006-04-09T07:03:00.000Z	_jason	cowboyfeng	does it work now?  (we should clean up a typo you made in diverting)
