2006-01-02T13:42:00.000Z	mwe	skon	kwifimanager is working well for you? it just crashes on me when i click the scan button
2006-01-02T13:43:00.000Z	skon	mwe	works fine
2006-01-08T17:57:00.000Z	mwe	skon	no 2.6.15-rc7 is but I think 2.6.12 is the newest in ubuntu repos
2006-01-08T06:00:00.000Z	mwe	skon	I see linux-image-2.6.12-10-386
2006-01-08T06:00:00.000Z	skon	mwe	I know....I was correct cmatheson.....I use that one too
2006-01-08T13:12:00.000Z	mwe	skon	what's the price?
2006-01-08T13:12:00.000Z	mwe	skon	$50 or something, right?
2006-01-08T13:13:00.000Z	skon	mwe	price for what?
2006-01-08T13:14:00.000Z	mwe	skon	rar
2006-01-08T13:14:00.000Z	mwe	skon	it's not freeware. only unrar is iirc
2006-01-08T13:15:00.000Z	skon	mwe	rar was free for me? i downloaded it from the site
2006-01-08T13:16:00.000Z	mwe	skon	I think you're supposed to pay if you use it more than 40 days.
2006-01-08T13:16:00.000Z	skon	mwe	lol, just noticed that...oh well I don't use rar much anyway
2006-01-13T06:38:00.000Z	mwe	skon	don't use dhcp
2006-01-13T06:38:00.000Z	skon	mwe	why should that matter?
2006-01-13T06:39:00.000Z	mwe	skon	because it overwrites /etc/resolv.conf
2006-01-13T11:32:00.000Z	mwe	skon	press the middle button
2006-01-13T11:32:00.000Z	mwe	skon	or both if you only got 2
2006-01-13T15:58:00.000Z	mwe	skon	what is it?
2006-01-13T15:59:00.000Z	mwe	skon	I haven't heard the concept restarting a module before
2006-01-13T16:00:00.000Z	skon	mwe	it's a script that hardens system security, but I changed the config file and it doesn't change the permissions yet. i figure restarting would help, but there is only a module for the bastille firewall
