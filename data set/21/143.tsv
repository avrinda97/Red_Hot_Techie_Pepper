2012-08-09T08:16:00.000Z	davidrsmorris		Hey, I have a livecd problem.  I have a known good 32bit livecd and when I try to run it on a dell latitude d820 I get Kernel Panic -- not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)
2012-08-09T08:16:00.000Z	tf2ftw	davidrsmorris	its a hdd problem
2012-08-09T08:17:00.000Z	davidrsmorris	tf2ftw	When I'm running a known good livecd?  Does that mean I should try booting off an external cd drive?
2012-08-09T08:17:00.000Z	tf2ftw	davidrsmorris	ive seen that issue with hackintosh systems
2012-08-09T08:17:00.000Z	tf2ftw	davidrsmorris	cannot load hdd hardware info
2012-08-09T08:18:00.000Z	tf2ftw	davidrsmorris	if you can, try another sata port, or another hd
2012-08-09T08:18:00.000Z	davidrsmorris	tf2ftw	as in, the VFS it's trying to create in memory, right?
2012-08-09T08:18:00.000Z	tf2ftw	davidrsmorris	as in, it cant access the hardware
2012-08-09T08:19:00.000Z	davidrsmorris	tf2ftw	so if I disconnect the hdd, it should boot fine?  It looks like it's having trouble making the vfs in memory.
2012-08-09T08:20:00.000Z	davidrsmorris	tf2ftw	or are you saying it can't access the vfs image on the disk?
2012-08-09T08:20:00.000Z	tf2ftw	davidrsmorris	how old is your hardware?
2012-08-09T08:23:00.000Z	davidrsmorris	tf2ftw	Just a few years.  It's a latitude with a gig of memory and a core duo processor.
2012-08-09T08:34:00.000Z	davidrsmorris	tf2ftw	hello?  Is that spectacularly old?
2012-08-09T08:34:00.000Z	davidrsmorris	tf2ftw	I thought as long as I had a gig of memory the new livecds would work?
2012-08-09T08:35:00.000Z	tf2ftw	davidrsmorris	its a hard drive issue
2012-08-09T08:35:00.000Z	tf2ftw		not a memmory
2012-08-09T08:35:00.000Z	tf2ftw		memory
2012-08-09T08:36:00.000Z	davidrsmorris	tf2ftw	since it's live, it won't touch the hard drive unless I want it to.  So it's either memory or disk...
2012-08-09T08:37:00.000Z	tf2ftw		its probing your hardware
2012-08-09T08:37:00.000Z	tf2ftw		try removing the hard drive
2012-08-09T08:38:00.000Z	davidrsmorris	tf2ftw	Ok, thanks.
