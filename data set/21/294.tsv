2012-05-12T01:31:00.000Z	beandog		just keep your private keys safe
2012-05-12T01:31:00.000Z	ozzloy	beandog	it did not mount it
2012-05-12T01:26:00.000Z	beandog	ozzloy	no, that's pretty standard
2012-05-12T01:27:00.000Z	ozzloy	beandog	good to know
2012-05-12T01:30:00.000Z	beandog	ozzloy	did it mount it?
2012-05-12T01:31:00.000Z	ozzloy	beandog	no it didn't
2012-05-12T01:31:00.000Z	beandog	ozzloy	what's /etc/exports say on the server
2012-05-12T01:32:00.000Z	ozzloy	beandog	i'm booting off a live cd and trying to mount the harddrive.  not sure why nfs comes into it at all
2012-05-12T01:32:00.000Z	beandog	ozzloy	wait, hold on a second .... what?  /dev/sda1 is a local block device, what are you trying to do?
2012-05-12T01:32:00.000Z	ozzloy	beandog	there is no /etc/exports
2012-05-12T01:33:00.000Z	ozzloy	beandog	i'm trying to mount the harddrive on the machien
2012-05-12T01:33:00.000Z	beandog	ozzloy	Oh I was gonna say ... NFS has nothing to do with it
2012-05-12T01:33:00.000Z	beandog	ozzloy	its ext2, I doubt that's your root drive.  That's gonna be /boot
2012-05-12T01:33:00.000Z	beandog	ozzloy	is your box raided?
2012-05-12T01:34:00.000Z	ozzloy	beandog	good question.  a little more detail: i'm dealing with this machine over vpn.  i don't actually have access to it physically.  i'll ask if it's raided
2012-05-12T01:35:00.000Z	beandog	ozzloy	from its UUID it certainly looks that way
2012-05-12T01:38:00.000Z	ozzloy	beandog	oh that does seem like raid
2012-05-12T01:39:00.000Z	beandog	ozzloy	the question is, where's the other device(s)
2012-05-12T01:40:00.000Z	ozzloy	beandog	wait, sda1 is not raid though, sda4 probably is
2012-05-12T01:41:00.000Z	beandog	ozzloy	why doy ou want sda1?
2012-05-12T01:41:00.000Z	beandog	ozzloy	anyway, it should mount fine .. dunno why it's trying as nfs
