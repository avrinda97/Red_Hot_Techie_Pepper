2009-09-30T00:53:00.000Z	RPG_Master	DasEi	I found a bunch of stuff in root/.local/share/trash but when I delete them as root they just pop back up there :O
2009-09-30T01:51:00.000Z	DasEi	RPG_Master	call your account in a browser an check..
2009-09-30T01:52:00.000Z	RPG_Master	DasEi	How do I do that?

2009-09-30T01:54:00.000Z	RPG_Master	DasEi	It doesn't matter, all my email has been removed on sync with their server
2009-09-30T01:59:00.000Z	DasEi	RPG_Master	if had set it to store locally, can do : sudo updatedb, then locate *blah-examplemail*  to see if it's still somewhere
2009-09-30T02:00:00.000Z	DasEi	RPG_Master	else login in your account online to see if mail is still on the (remote) server, then can down them again
2009-09-30T02:02:00.000Z	DasEi	RPG_Master	so badly configured, try to locate the mail (sure you still remember a sender like amazon or something to search comp for)
2009-09-30T02:05:00.000Z	DasEi	RPG_Master	and now that dir is empty ?
2009-09-30T02:08:00.000Z	DasEi	RPG_Master	locate didn't find them either ? also not in :
2009-09-30T02:17:00.000Z	DasEi	RPG_Master	a last time , no clue by locate ?

2009-09-30T02:20:00.000Z	DasEi	RPG_Master	this is what ? result of ls in the mail dir ? seems everything is fine ..
2009-09-30T02:21:00.000Z	RPG_Master	DasEi	Yep, but its not. They are all empty files
2009-09-30T02:22:00.000Z	DasEi	RPG_Master	fearful , uugh, hmm,  try : sudo updatedb && locate *Inbox* to check for any doubles, that looks bad then
2009-09-30T02:34:00.000Z	DasEi	RPG_Master	nah, you can't learn early enough, can you ;-)
