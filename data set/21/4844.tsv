2008-02-03T22:55:00.000Z	Tygir		any ideas how i can get an .avi to play in ubuntu?
2008-02-03T22:57:00.000Z	Tygir		i cant seem to get .avi to play....any help?
2008-02-03T22:58:00.000Z	mnemonic_	Tygir	which player did you try?
2008-02-03T22:59:00.000Z	Tygir	mnemonic_	i have tried vlc and mplayer, and i have all codecs installed....w32codecs....
2008-02-03T23:00:00.000Z	mnemonic_	Tygir	AVI is only a container format and not a video codec. Can you try to find out what codec it actually is? If you run mplayer from a terminal it might display some information.
2008-02-03T23:01:00.000Z	Tygir	mnemonic_	how do i run mplayer from the terminal and try and open the .avi file?
2008-02-03T23:02:00.000Z	mnemonic_	Tygir	hm try to see the properties in the file manager first and look for the "MIME type".
2008-02-03T23:04:00.000Z	Tygir	mnemonic_	sorry, im a newb....can you explain more?
2008-02-03T23:06:00.000Z	mnemonic_	Tygir	right click the video file and select properties. A window will be displayed which should show the so called "MIME type" of the file. This says something about the file's contents. Please tell me what it says.
2008-02-03T23:08:00.000Z	Tygir	mnemonic_	ahhhh, ok thanks for explaining...here is the MIME type "video/x-msvideo"
2008-02-03T23:09:00.000Z	mnemonic_	Tygir	can you try to play it with a player that uses the gstreamer engine? That can be the Totem Video Player for example. If you have installed all gstreamer plugins (good, bad, ugly) it should work.
2008-02-03T23:09:00.000Z	Tygir	mnemonic_	is totem the default player?
2008-02-03T23:10:00.000Z	mnemonic_	Tygir	yes. But its capabilities vary depending on which gstreamer plugins you have installed - so make sure you install (gstreamer0.10-good, bad, ugly, ffmpeg).
2008-02-03T23:10:00.000Z	Tygir	mnemonic_	yeah, i just made sure i had all gstreamer plugins installed...and i do...
2008-02-03T23:11:00.000Z	mnemonic_	Tygir	and does it work with Totem?
2008-02-03T23:12:00.000Z	Tygir	mnemonic_	nope...i try to open it and it just closes...doesnt play anything...just closes...
2008-02-03T23:14:00.000Z	mnemonic_	Tygir	there may be a chance that the file uses a wmv9 or wmv10 format and utilizes DRM. In this case you will not be able to play it.
2008-02-03T23:14:00.000Z	mnemonic_	Tygir	but please read the ubuntu wiki - maybe you'll find something there that I've missed.
2008-02-03T23:14:00.000Z	Tygir	mnemonic_	i dont think it does...i downloaded a TV show...off of usenet...i dont think there is any wmv9 or 10 or DRM...
2008-02-03T23:15:00.000Z	mnemonic_	Tygir	hm I cannot really think of anything else to do if you tried all players. Which version of ubuntu are you using?
2008-02-03T23:16:00.000Z	Tygir	mnemonic_	7.10
