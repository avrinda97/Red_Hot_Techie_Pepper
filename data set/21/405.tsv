2012-08-31T17:25:00.000Z	kroonrs	SilvereX	If it's NTFS, it may be mounted read-only by default?
2012-08-31T17:27:00.000Z	kroonrs	SilvereX	or possibly mounted with a different owner.  Try ls -l <filename> - are you the owner, and what are the permissions?
2012-08-31T17:30:00.000Z	SilvereX	kroonrs	in properties, in the permissions tab, it says I am not the owner so I cannot change the settings
2012-08-31T17:30:00.000Z	SilvereX	kroonrs	Would that restrict me to read only?
2012-08-31T17:31:00.000Z	kroonrs	SilvereX	if you "cat /etc/fstab" is the mount point a ntfs file system?
2012-08-31T17:32:00.000Z	kroonrs	SilvereX	if you're not the owner, and the owner hasn't given you permission to change the file, you'd have read-only, yeah.  Normally NTFS is mounted as owned by root, and as read-only, as I understand it.
2012-08-31T17:32:00.000Z	kroonrs	SilvereX	but it can be overridden
2012-08-31T17:33:00.000Z	SilvereX	kroonrs	So how exactly would I change it?
2012-08-31T17:34:00.000Z	SilvereX	kroonrs	It says the owner is root.
2012-08-31T17:35:00.000Z	kroonrs	SilvereX	well, first we check if that's the issue
2012-08-31T17:35:00.000Z	kroonrs	SilvereX	if so, it may be you don't have ntfs-3g installed?
2012-08-31T17:35:00.000Z	kroonrs	SilvereX	in which case, installing that and rebooting might solve it
2012-08-31T17:36:00.000Z	SilvereX	kroonrs	How would I install it?
2012-08-31T17:37:00.000Z	kroonrs	SilvereX	^
2012-08-31T17:41:00.000Z	SilvereX	kroonrs	Already got ntfs-3g. What now?
2012-08-31T17:44:00.000Z	kroonrs	SilvereX	is the partition NTFS?
2012-08-31T17:44:00.000Z	kroonrs	SilvereX	and what's the relevant line in /etc/fstab ?
2012-08-31T17:46:00.000Z	SilvereX	kroonrs	I'm pretty sure it's fat32. I always format to fat32 for usb sticks. /etc/fstab says permission denied
2012-08-31T17:47:00.000Z	kroonrs	SilvereX	can you "sudo cat /etc/fstab", or don't you have sudo rights?
2012-08-31T17:51:00.000Z	SilvereX	kroonrs	I'm really tired. I really should get some sleep. Thanks for your help, though
2012-08-31T17:51:00.000Z	kroonrs	SilvereX	ok, hope you get it sorted tomorrow
