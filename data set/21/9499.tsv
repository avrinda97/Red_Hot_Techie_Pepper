2007-01-03T11:05:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	Random_Transit	i would backup your /home, then do clean install .. .really would make much more sense.. i've experienced your pain and learned
2007-01-03T11:05:00.000Z	Random_Transit	nomasteryoda	it's just a broken package
2007-01-03T11:05:00.000Z	Random_Transit	nomasteryoda	ok
2007-01-03T11:07:00.000Z	Random_Transit	nomasteryoda	the offending package wasn't fixed through dpkg
2007-01-03T11:07:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	Random_Transit	what package?
2007-01-03T11:08:00.000Z	Random_Transit	nomasteryoda	courier-authdaemon
2007-01-03T11:08:00.000Z	Random_Transit	nomasteryoda	i've tried doing an apt-get install -f and other methods...and they all freak out
2007-01-03T11:09:00.000Z	Random_Transit	nomasteryoda	tried that too
2007-01-03T11:09:00.000Z	Random_Transit	nomasteryoda	can i PM you, so as to get away from the crowd?
2007-01-03T11:11:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	Random_Transit	look at this thread about half-way down... https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/courier-authlib/+bug/64615
2007-01-03T11:11:00.000Z	Random_Transit	nomasteryoda	i'm going to PM you the error i get from apt-get, ok?
