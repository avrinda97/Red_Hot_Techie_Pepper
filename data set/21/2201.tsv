2010-03-20T05:50:00.000Z	oso3000		i installed wine-doors (a gui for wine)... which installed msttfcorefonts... now my firefox fonts look horrible... i tried uninstalling the ms fonts, but looks even worse... what should i do?
2010-03-20T05:52:00.000Z	igoryonya	oso3000	maybe you will have better chance in #winehq channel
2010-03-20T05:55:00.000Z	oso3000	igoryonya	in the wine channels they say ask in firefox channels, in firefox channels they say ask in ubuntu channels, and it seems like in ubuntu channels they say ask in wine channels  :)

2010-03-20T05:57:00.000Z	igoryonya	oso3000	do you have a problem with windows firefox, or linux firefox after this?
2010-03-20T05:58:00.000Z	igoryonya	oso3000	now you puzzled me. I always thought that those ms specific fonts for wine get installed in drive_c/windows/fonts folder.
2010-03-20T05:59:00.000Z	oso3000	igoryonya	yeah it's kinda strange
2010-03-20T06:00:00.000Z	igoryonya	oso3000	...but, since linux firefox gets screwed up because of this, they get installed to some linux folder. If they installed into wine folder, I might of been able to help, since I am a proin windows, not linux yet.
2010-03-20T06:01:00.000Z	igoryonya	oso3000	did you try the -  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FontInstallHowto yet?
2010-03-20T06:01:00.000Z	oso3000	igoryonya	yep
2010-03-20T06:02:00.000Z	igoryonya	oso3000	did you check your firefox config, fonts section, maybe it just some settings changed in firefox?
2010-03-20T06:03:00.000Z	igoryonya	oso3000	do other programs look normal, other then firefox?
2010-03-20T06:03:00.000Z	oso3000	igoryonya	yes, everything else looks normal
2010-03-20T06:04:00.000Z	oso3000	igoryonya	at least it hasn't changed in a way that i can notice... but firefox is horrible
2010-03-20T06:05:00.000Z	igoryonya	oso3000	check the preferences in firefox, maybe it's just a matter of screwed up settings.
2010-03-20T06:05:00.000Z	oso3000	igoryonya	already did
2010-03-20T06:06:00.000Z	igoryonya	oso3000	did you try backing up your firefox profile and creating a new one, just to see if it changes some things?
2010-03-20T06:06:00.000Z	oso3000	igoryonya	yes, no results
2010-03-20T06:09:00.000Z	igoryonya	oso3000	I know that this is more like a windows approach, :-& , but perhaps: sudo apt-get install firefox --reinstall
2010-03-20T06:10:00.000Z	oso3000	igoryonya	already tried, no results
2010-03-20T06:13:00.000Z	igoryonya	oso3000	:) seems to me you've tried everything that I am suggesting, I don't have much experience with linux yet. I can't suggest anything else, I would start searching for something like: msttfcorefonts firefox in google.
