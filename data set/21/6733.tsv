2007-10-10T15:57:00.000Z	opexoc		Do you know what it means when I get this during mounting network shares process: 8931: session setup failed: ERRDOS - ERRnoaccess (Access denied.)
2007-10-10T15:57:00.000Z	opexoc		SMB connection failed
2007-10-10T15:57:00.000Z	myconid	opexoc	that would be an access denied message.
2007-10-10T15:58:00.000Z	opexoc	myconid	I know, but why? I am using "sudo" command to mount resources.
2007-10-10T15:58:00.000Z	myconid	opexoc	you dont have perms on the remote machine.
2007-10-10T16:02:00.000Z	opexoc	myconid	ok but this resources what I want to get are on my ubuntu machine. It is very weird for me that I can explore them thanks to WIN XP on other side of network, but I can't do this from my system using default file manager.
2007-10-10T16:03:00.000Z	opexoc	myconid	when I want to explore this file then I get: the folder contents could not be displayed.
2007-10-10T16:03:00.000Z	myconid	opexoc	This is ubuntu support.. your error is a Windows side error.
2007-10-10T16:04:00.000Z	myconid	opexoc	but I would bet a beer or two its a windowspermission issue
2007-10-10T16:05:00.000Z	opexoc	myconid	You maybe don't understand. This has nothing with Windows. I want to explore my own directories on my ubuntu machine throught ubuntu graphic file manager.
2007-10-10T16:05:00.000Z	myconid	opexoc	and whats the problem?
2007-10-10T16:05:00.000Z	myconid	opexoc	what folder are you trying to view
2007-10-10T16:07:00.000Z	opexoc	myconid	No I want to view my home folder throught this graphic windows manager - smb://opexoc/homes. And I get what I said.
2007-10-10T16:08:00.000Z	opexoc	myconid	but when I want to explore it thanks to windows xp then I have to put password and I can do explore it.
2007-10-10T16:08:00.000Z	myconid	opexoc	so, I offer my previous assertion once again -- you have a samba permissions issue.
2007-10-10T16:09:00.000Z	opexoc	myconid	because I am testing samba. What I can do and what I can't.
2007-10-10T16:09:00.000Z	myconid	opexoc	its either software,hardware, or user error.
2007-10-10T16:09:00.000Z	myconid	opexoc	it sounds like youve tested software and hardware
2007-10-10T16:10:00.000Z	opexoc	myconid	I just wonder why I can't explore my own resources.
2007-10-10T16:11:00.000Z	myconid	opexoc	so, I offer my previous assertion once again -- you have a samba permissions issue. <<<<
2007-10-10T16:12:00.000Z	opexoc	myconid	yes. probably. But do you know what should I do to repair that ( any suggestions? )?
