2006-06-16T16:15:00.000Z	PSIplus		hi
2006-06-16T16:15:00.000Z	PSIplus		how can i change the locale in dapper?
2006-06-16T16:16:00.000Z	PSIplus		...what i did in breezy and debian with dpkg --reconfigure locales
2006-06-16T16:16:00.000Z	PSIplus		doesn't work anymore
2006-06-16T16:18:00.000Z	PSIplus		no ideas about the locales-issue?
2006-06-16T16:18:00.000Z	nickrud	PSIplus	System-Admin language support should do it
2006-06-16T16:19:00.000Z	PSIplus	nickrud	I'm in no-gui env
2006-06-16T16:19:00.000Z	PSIplus	nickrud	i want to know what language support does ;-)
2006-06-16T16:20:00.000Z	nickrud	PSIplus	then, since they changed things out from under me (used to be dpkg-reconfigure locales) I don't know
2006-06-16T16:20:00.000Z	nickrud	PSIplus	changes locale :)
2006-06-16T16:20:00.000Z	PSIplus	nickrud	me neither ;-)
2006-06-16T16:20:00.000Z	PSIplus	nickrud	it's totally different... Totally! :-)
2006-06-16T16:21:00.000Z	PSIplus	nickrud	now i have an utf-8 environment and an iso8859-15 chroot -- and that suxx a bit... ;-)
2006-06-16T16:21:00.000Z	nickrud	PSIplus	yes, that could be a problem
2006-06-16T16:22:00.000Z	PSIplus	nickrud	normaly, a dpkg-reconfigure locales in the chroot should have done the job ;-) ... well, however, you know... ;-)
2006-06-16T16:32:00.000Z	nickrud	PSIplus	nice looking, thanks
2006-06-16T16:34:00.000Z	PSIplus	nickrud	looking? man locale-gen ;-)
2006-06-16T16:34:00.000Z	PSIplus	nickrud	use the formats from /usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED
2006-06-16T16:35:00.000Z	nickrud	PSIplus	nah, I didn't look hard because I'm not running a chroot except for breezy, and that's just for info
2006-06-16T16:36:00.000Z	PSIplus	nickrud	but it's one of these "good to know"-topics, isn't it? ;-)
2006-06-16T16:37:00.000Z	nickrud	PSIplus	I've ignored that question, no longer need. Like I said, Thanks
