2006-08-25T14:31:00.000Z	natural20		can't upload via ftp, can't access email, can't load certain webpages...  wtf is wrong with my comp?
2006-08-25T14:31:00.000Z	W_McL	natural20	are you behind a router or firewall?
2006-08-25T14:31:00.000Z	natural20	W_McL	not sure about firewall, i'm on DSL
2006-08-25T14:32:00.000Z	W_McL	natural20	on DSL with or without a router?
2006-08-25T14:32:00.000Z	natural20	W_McL	no firewall on computer (unless ubuntu has one)
2006-08-25T14:32:00.000Z	W_McL	natural20	many DSL-routers have builtin firewalls
2006-08-25T14:33:00.000Z	W_McL	natural20	check if you are behind one and if yes, check it's settings
2006-08-25T14:33:00.000Z	natural20	W_McL	i believe it is a router
2006-08-25T14:33:00.000Z	natural20	W_McL	what settings am i checking?
2006-08-25T14:33:00.000Z	W_McL	natural20	the settings of your router
2006-08-25T14:34:00.000Z	natural20	W_McL	but settings for what? to see if there is a firewall?
2006-08-25T14:36:00.000Z	W_McL	natural20	yes. check if your router has a builtin firewall and check it's settings
2006-08-25T14:38:00.000Z	natural20	W_McL	ok, my router's firewall was set to allow all traffic, no issue there.
2006-08-25T14:39:00.000Z	W_McL	natural20	ok. so what exactly does not work?
2006-08-25T14:40:00.000Z	natural20		i can't enter yahoo groups members area (and various other log-in sites), i can't upload anything via FTP.  I've tried multiple browsers/clients, everything stalls and/or fails.
2006-08-25T14:41:00.000Z	natural20	W_McL	i can't enter yahoo groups members area (and various other log-in sites), i can't upload anything via FTP.  I've tried multiple browsers/clients, everything stalls and/or fails.
2006-08-25T14:42:00.000Z	W_McL	natural20	can you reach the adresses of the sites in any other way? do the servers answer to a ping?
2006-08-25T14:43:00.000Z	natural20	W_McL	i don't know how i would reach the sites without a browser, yes they answer to a ping
2006-08-25T14:43:00.000Z	W_McL	natural20	do those sites use some plugins like for example flash, and you don't have it installed?
2006-08-25T14:49:00.000Z	natural20	W_McL	no the only thing they require is cookies, which is enabled
2006-08-25T14:49:00.000Z	W_McL	natural20	sorry... don't know how to help
