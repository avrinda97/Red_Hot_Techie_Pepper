2005-02-09T16:23:00.000Z	Peter		how do i tell what video driver i am using?
2005-02-09T16:23:00.000Z	lemsx1	Peter	cat /var/log/XFree86.log (or xorg.log) | grep -i driver
2005-02-09T16:28:00.000Z	Peter	lemsx1	does xorg use xorg.conf? or can it use either of the two?
2005-02-09T16:28:00.000Z	lemsx1	Peter	xorg.conf only
2005-02-09T16:29:00.000Z	lemsx1	Peter	it is. 3d works like a charm
2005-02-09T16:31:00.000Z	Peter	lemsx1	could you check my xorg.conf, to see if it indicates what the error is?
2005-02-09T16:32:00.000Z	lemsx1	Peter	do you use a nvidia card?
2005-02-09T16:32:00.000Z	lemsx1	Peter	what happens when you run glxgears?
2005-02-09T16:32:00.000Z	lemsx1	Peter	if acceleration is on, you will see over 200 fps
2005-02-09T16:33:00.000Z	lemsx1	Peter	/usr/bin/X11/glxgears
2005-02-09T16:34:00.000Z	lemsx1	Peter	ummm, i wonder how i got that now... maybe the ati sources install it
2005-02-09T16:35:00.000Z	lemsx1	Peter	i don't recall how i got that install... but it's part of the ati download for sure... there is a cooler one also
2005-02-09T16:36:00.000Z	lemsx1	Peter	/usr/bin/X11/fgl_glxgears
2005-02-09T16:37:00.000Z	lemsx1	Peter	i got that the first time i installed fglrx (by converting the .rpm to .deb and from some sources i don't seem to recall now)
2005-02-09T16:39:00.000Z	lemsx1	Peter	that's a very good number!
2005-02-09T16:39:00.000Z	lemsx1	Peter	hell yeah
2005-02-09T16:40:00.000Z	lemsx1	Peter	well, perhaps not as good for that card
2005-02-09T16:40:00.000Z	lemsx1	Peter	but glxgears is not a benchmarking program. it just gives you an idea
2005-02-09T16:40:00.000Z	Peter	lemsx1	do you know anything about 'dcroot'?
2005-02-09T16:40:00.000Z	lemsx1	Peter	nvidia with agp 8x perhaps
2005-02-09T16:40:00.000Z	lemsx1	Peter	ditto. never heard of it
