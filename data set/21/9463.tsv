2005-09-19T11:46:00.000Z	pr0tocol		hey all whats going on
2005-09-19T11:46:00.000Z	pr0tocol		I have a quick question:
2005-09-19T11:46:00.000Z	pr0tocol		I just upgraded to Breezy yesterday and X won't start anymore...tells me something about "same driver version"
2005-09-19T11:47:00.000Z	pr0tocol		any ideas guys?
2005-09-19T11:48:00.000Z	pr0tocol		Is there a problem with the nvidia drivers in Breezy?
2005-09-19T11:49:00.000Z	pr0tocol		so...I'm stuck using the console :P
2005-09-19T11:50:00.000Z	djm62	pr0tocol	you could use the free nvidia drivers as a stopgap... nv?
2005-09-19T11:50:00.000Z	pr0tocol	djm62	what do you mean?
2005-09-19T11:51:00.000Z	djm62	pr0tocol	oh, damn.  are you using an nvidia card?
2005-09-19T11:52:00.000Z	pr0tocol	djm62	yup
2005-09-19T11:53:00.000Z	djm62	pr0tocol	there are official binary drivers, which you need to compile against your kernel (so they match).  or there are community-maintained drivers (which will work, but aren't as good as the official nvidia ones in terms of speed)
2005-09-19T11:55:00.000Z	djm62	pr0tocol	you could get the nvidia drivers and do the jigging, or use the Free ones and wait for a package or Breezy-Nvidia-howto to appear
2005-09-19T12:08:00.000Z	pr0tocol	djm62	kind of a headache after a while :>
2005-09-19T12:09:00.000Z	djm62	pr0tocol	I find it kind of nice...doesn't keep me off firefox, right enough
2005-09-19T12:10:00.000Z	pr0tocol	djm62	it's not bad using console. MEMOOORIES :D Plus it makes me feel l337 again lol

2005-09-19T12:11:00.000Z	pr0tocol	djm62	lol. I'm listening to Voodoo People - Eskimo remix :P
2005-09-19T12:13:00.000Z	djm62	pr0tocol	if you can back up $HOME, a hoary install is only an hour...you've spent half of that in IRC already
2005-09-19T12:24:00.000Z	djm62	pr0tocol	I did that
2005-09-19T12:24:00.000Z	djm62	pr0tocol	I worked out ctrl-alt-f1...and had to learn how to install links and use links to find out how to ctrl-alt-f7 :-/
2005-09-19T12:25:00.000Z	pr0tocol	djm62	lol
