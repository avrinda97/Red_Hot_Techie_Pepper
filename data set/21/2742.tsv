2010-06-17T23:43:00.000Z	Bookman		Could someone please tell me the name of the ati open source driver?  I need to confirm it is installed
2010-06-17T23:44:00.000Z	crdlb	Bookman	the actual driver is in xserver-xorg-video-radeon, but -video-ati depends on it
2010-06-17T23:46:00.000Z	Bookman	crdlb	ah, not found so it is not installed after all.  That would explain my 3D not working.
2010-06-17T23:48:00.000Z	Bookman	crdlb	and yet synaptic says it is installed.....this really is a mess!
2010-06-17T23:49:00.000Z	crdlb	Bookman	pastebin your /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2010-06-18T00:03:00.000Z	Bookman	crdlb	http://pastebin.ca/1885267
2010-06-18T00:06:00.000Z	crdlb	Bookman	so what happens if you 'sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-radeon' ?
2010-06-18T00:06:00.000Z	Bookman	crdlb	but synaptic says it is already installed
2010-06-18T00:07:00.000Z	crdlb	Bookman	what about xserver-xorg-video-ati ? X seems to be trying to use that wrapper
2010-06-18T00:09:00.000Z	Bookman	crdlb	It installed it.  I assume I have to restart?
2010-06-18T00:16:00.000Z	Bookman	crdlb	ok, restarted.....
2010-06-18T00:19:00.000Z	crdlb	Bookman	pastebin your /var/log/Xorg.0.log again
2010-06-18T00:21:00.000Z	Bookman	crdlb	http://pastebin.ca/1885284
2010-06-18T00:22:00.000Z	crdlb	Bookman	looks good to me
2010-06-18T00:22:00.000Z	Bookman	crdlb	yeah, still not working though....
2010-06-18T00:23:00.000Z	crdlb	Bookman	what isn't, exactly?
2010-06-18T00:25:00.000Z	Bookman	crdlb	when I restarted, my windows still have to title bar or close/minimize/window buttons.  I cannot move them.  I have to go to System>Preferences>Appearance>Visual Effects>Extra to turn them on.
2010-06-18T00:25:00.000Z	Bookman	crdlb	and no compiz
2010-06-18T00:32:00.000Z	Bookman	crdlb	nope, just restarted and I have to go through the whole System>Preferences>Appearance>Visual Effects>Extra thing to be able to use my system
2010-06-18T00:35:00.000Z	crdlb	Bookman	does compiz work when you do that?
2010-06-18T00:35:00.000Z	Bookman	crdlb	nope
