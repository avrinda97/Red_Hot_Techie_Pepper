2008-02-24T20:55:00.000Z	steel_lady		hello, I have a short question, I just want to check... I bought the external disk od 500G. I need to use it for windows and linux both. can it be formated to fat32?
2008-02-24T20:57:00.000Z	lex	steel_lady	yes, but single file size will be limited to 2gb; although linux with ntfs-3g can write to ntfs
2008-02-24T20:58:00.000Z	lex	steel_lady	if you mount ntfs using the utility ntfs-3g, there isn't a problem
2008-02-24T21:20:00.000Z	lex	steel_lady	your local user needs permissions to access the drive; aside from mounting it as well
2008-02-24T21:21:00.000Z	lex	steel_lady	so that just leaves changing the permissions then
2008-02-24T21:21:00.000Z	steel_lady	lex	how do I give those permissions?
2008-02-24T21:22:00.000Z	lex	steel_lady	look into chown or chmod; google and the fourms should yield good results
2008-02-24T21:23:00.000Z	steel_lady	lex	using TestDisk it gives me dr-xr-xr-x     0     0         0 24-Feb-2008 17:01  for that disk
2008-02-24T21:54:00.000Z	lex	steel_lady	have you checked your /etc/mtab or /fstab?
2008-02-24T22:08:00.000Z	lex	steel_lady	can you see the files but not write to the disk?
2008-02-24T22:09:00.000Z	steel_lady	lex	esto era un disco vacio. lo habia formateado a FAT32 despues me acaban de cambiar de opinion y lo acabo de formatear a NTFS otra vez y ahora no lo puedo usar
2008-02-24T22:11:00.000Z	lex	steel_lady	ha, well NTFS was a "better" solution then Fat32 yes, but after having ntfs-3g mount the drive, you need to change either the ownership of the drive from root to your current user, or edit the rw (read / write) permissions so that your user can access the drive fully
2008-02-24T22:12:00.000Z	steel_lady	lex	how do I change the ownership to user?
2008-02-24T22:13:00.000Z	lex	steel_lady	i think i mentioned earlier to look into "chown" and "chmod"
2008-02-24T22:14:00.000Z	lex	steel_lady	in a terminal "man -k <command>" or "<command> --help"
2008-02-24T22:16:00.000Z	steel_lady	lex	I try to write on in as root. it does not complain but the file doesn't appear either
2008-02-24T22:17:00.000Z	lex	steel_lady	have you chowned it or edited it with chmod to be able to read and write to it with your user?
2008-02-24T22:19:00.000Z	steel_lady	lex	nina@minino:~$ man chown -k
2008-02-24T22:20:00.000Z	steel_lady	lex	man command does not give me any help
2008-02-24T22:20:00.000Z	lex	steel_lady	chown --help
2008-02-24T22:22:00.000Z	steel_lady	lex	these instructions are very confusing for me, maybe because english is not my first language
