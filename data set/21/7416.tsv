2007-09-26T05:51:00.000Z	VSpike	pwn	just add at the end..  [MyNTFSVol]   //  comment = Something useful  //  path = /media/sda2  // read only = yes
2007-09-26T05:51:00.000Z	pwn		Ah okay
2007-09-26T05:51:00.000Z	pwn		Let me try that
2007-09-26T05:51:00.000Z	pwn		:)
2007-09-26T05:51:00.000Z	VSpike	pwn	where // is new line, [MyNTFSVol]  is the share name, and path is the path to the NTFS mount
2007-09-26T05:51:00.000Z	VSpike	pwn	then do sudo invoke-rc.d samba restart
2007-09-26T05:52:00.000Z	pwn	VSpike	I can put any name I want for MyNTFSVol?
2007-09-26T05:52:00.000Z	VSpike	pwn	if you used ntfs-3g and the stuff is writable, and you want it shared writable, use "read only = no"
2007-09-26T05:52:00.000Z	VSpike	pwn	Yep, as long as its a valid share name
2007-09-26T05:53:00.000Z	pwn	VSpike	The share is /media/Music ... So I just put [Music] ?
2007-09-26T05:54:00.000Z	VSpike	pwn	you could, or [OldMusicFiles]  or whatever you like... can't remember if space is OK, so best avoid it
2007-09-26T05:54:00.000Z	pwn		Okay, I'm trying it
2007-09-26T05:54:00.000Z	VSpike	pwn	recommend you investigate SWAT too
2007-09-26T05:55:00.000Z	VSpike	pwn	only hassle with it is you have to enable the root account, bu tthat's pretty easy
2007-09-26T05:55:00.000Z	pwn		SWAT?
2007-09-26T05:55:00.000Z	VSpike		!swat
2007-09-26T05:56:00.000Z	VSpike	pwn	that's not much help... http://samba.org/samba/docs/man/Samba-HOWTO-Collection/SWAT.html
2007-09-26T05:57:00.000Z	VSpike	pwn	basically do "sudo apt-get install swat", then "sudo passwd root", then point a browser to "localhost:901"
2007-09-26T06:01:00.000Z	pwn	VSpike	I tried what you suggested, adding that line to smb.conf and it worked perfectly. But you say SWAT is better?
2007-09-26T06:02:00.000Z	VSpike	pwn	swat is pretty handy sometimes.  I like editing smb.conf directly too, but swat is nice to have for some things.  Not least, easy access to the help file for every option.
2007-09-26T06:03:00.000Z	VSpike	pwn	it's basically a web interface for samba config and management
