2006-05-03T08:49:00.000Z	buckwild		has anyone here ever compiled a xmms plugin before?
2006-05-03T08:49:00.000Z	buckwild		I'd really like to compile this null output plugin for xmms but I have no idea how to do it?
2006-05-03T08:49:00.000Z	buckwild		? = .
2006-05-03T08:50:00.000Z	NickGarvey	buckwild	have build-essential? if not "sudo apt-get build-essential"
2006-05-03T08:50:00.000Z	NickGarvey	buckwild	if you are unsure, then you don't
2006-05-03T08:51:00.000Z	NickGarvey	buckwild	ok then apt-get the file I said
2006-05-03T08:51:00.000Z	buckwild	NickGarvey	I already have the build-essentials installed, what do I do from there? I always forget what the exact tar command is and such, if you could just give me an idiot example really quick that would be great
2006-05-03T08:52:00.000Z	NickGarvey	buckwild	:) is it a .tar.gz? if so then "tar xvfz filename.tar.gz"
2006-05-03T08:53:00.000Z	buckwild	NickGarvey	yeah it is, okay then after the tar it's typically what after that?
2006-05-03T08:53:00.000Z	buckwild	NickGarvey	I'm gonna put this in a text file so I never have to feel like an idiot again
2006-05-03T08:53:00.000Z	NickGarvey	buckwild	cd ./directory_of_file
2006-05-03T08:54:00.000Z	NickGarvey	buckwild	then "less INSTALL" usually, if thats not there then "less README" normally, basically look for the readme
2006-05-03T08:54:00.000Z	NickGarvey	buckwild	although the default 3 commands are "./configure" "make" "sudo make install"
2006-05-03T08:54:00.000Z	NickGarvey	buckwild	but reading the readme will never do you any harm, so do it
2006-05-03T08:55:00.000Z	buckwild	NickGarvey	no readme on this one, they like to let me fly without a safety net
2006-05-03T09:31:00.000Z	NickGarvey	buckwild	then apt-get glib
2006-05-03T09:31:00.000Z	NickGarvey	buckwild	second..
2006-05-03T09:33:00.000Z	NickGarvey	buckwild	its there
2006-05-03T09:33:00.000Z	NickGarvey	buckwild	libglib2.0-0
2006-05-03T09:34:00.000Z	NickGarvey	buckwild	and whats it complaining about then?
2006-05-03T09:35:00.000Z	NickGarvey	buckwild	whats it say
