2008-11-09T04:42:00.000Z	shredder12	buntoow	earlier when i was using Hardy i got an update for 2.6.24-21 i upgraded my kernel but found that there was no ethernet device when i used the new kernel..so i continued working on 24-19 but when i upgraded my system to intrepid...i faced the same problem with the new kernel..2.6.27-7..that's why i am looking for some solution..??

2008-11-09T05:02:00.000Z	shredder12	buntoow	i think you mean /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/net
2008-11-09T05:03:00.000Z	shredder12	buntoow	there is no directory of such name or anywhere near that name here..
2008-11-09T05:03:00.000Z	shredder12	buntoow	that directory only has subdirectories
2008-11-09T05:05:00.000Z	shredder12	buntoow	no the directories are same for both of them..
2008-11-09T05:05:00.000Z	shredder12	buntoow	yes,,i listed both of their contents and they are exactly same..

2008-11-09T05:08:00.000Z	shredder12	buntoow	well let me tell you that both of these directories have quite a bit of size difference..old one is only 6.1 Mb and the new one is 8.3 Mb
2008-11-09T05:10:00.000Z	shredder12	buntoow	i have a file name r8168 in the old one i.e. the one i am currently using..
