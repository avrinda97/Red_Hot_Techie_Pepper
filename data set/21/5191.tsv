2008-01-19T16:00:00.000Z	[Gutsy]TuTUXG	DRebellion	i need to make an iso partition in able to install windows from hd
2008-01-19T16:00:00.000Z	DRebellion	[Gutsy]TuTUXG	i think using a memory stick would be more appropriate
2008-01-19T16:01:00.000Z	DRebellion	[Gutsy]TuTUXG	but i still don't know how or why you would need to do that
2008-01-19T16:01:00.000Z	[Gutsy]TuTUXG	DRebellion	i hate to do this, but this is my friend's laptop and it doesnt have a working cdrom

2008-01-19T16:01:00.000Z	[Gutsy]TuTUXG	DRebellion	becuse i need to boot from the iso file using grub
2008-01-19T16:02:00.000Z	[Gutsy]TuTUXG	DRebellion	or iso "partition"
2008-01-19T16:02:00.000Z	DRebellion	[Gutsy]TuTUXG	can't you just put the iso file on the disk and then tel grub to use it?
2008-01-19T16:02:00.000Z	[Gutsy]TuTUXG	DRebellion	would grub need a kernel image in that case?
2008-01-19T16:02:00.000Z	DRebellion	[Gutsy]TuTUXG	yar, methinks
2008-01-19T16:03:00.000Z	[Gutsy]TuTUXG	DRebellion	?
