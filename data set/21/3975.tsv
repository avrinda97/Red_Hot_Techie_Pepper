2009-05-10T00:29:00.000Z	ryanprior		I can use IRC but my web browser, BitTorrent, etc can't connect to the network. How can I find out what is going on?
2009-05-10T00:30:00.000Z	ryanprior		Can anyone hear me? I'm having network troubles. I can see the messages coming through, can you see mine?

2009-05-10T00:35:00.000Z	poningru	ryanprior	have you tried other browsers?
2009-05-10T00:35:00.000Z	ryanprior	poningru	Firefox doesn't work, ping doesn't work, telnet doesn't work.

2009-05-10T00:36:00.000Z	poningru	ryanprior	can telnet into your smtp server on 25?
2009-05-10T00:36:00.000Z	ryanprior	poningru	Although as you can see IRC works just fine somehow.
2009-05-10T00:37:00.000Z	ryanprior	poningru	Would that just be "telnet localhost 25"?
2009-05-10T00:37:00.000Z	poningru	ryanprior	you dont have other smtp servers?
2009-05-10T00:37:00.000Z	poningru	ryanprior	does another computer in your network work fine?

2009-05-10T00:39:00.000Z	ryanprior	poningru	I don't know if those computers can get the internets.
2009-05-10T00:39:00.000Z	poningru	ryanprior	do you have a webserver on your network?
2009-05-10T00:40:00.000Z	ryanprior	poningru	I have a webserver running on this very machine and can't connect to it.
2009-05-10T00:41:00.000Z	poningru	ryanprior	what does netstat -tuap say?
2009-05-10T00:42:00.000Z	ryanprior	poningru	It says a lot, what should I be looking for?
2009-05-10T00:42:00.000Z	poningru	ryanprior	just making sure it is making connections
2009-05-10T00:44:00.000Z	ryanprior	poningru	There is no reason it should have any use. =P
