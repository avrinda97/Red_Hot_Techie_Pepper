2007-03-15T11:11:00.000Z	mustiy		Sadface... Nobody knows why i get a "no public key" error when adding the official repatories?
2007-03-15T11:12:00.000Z	cypher1	mustiy	i think man apt-key should provide some clues
2007-03-15T11:13:00.000Z	mustiy	cypher1	Sorry, i didnt understand - can you be more detailed?
2007-03-15T11:14:00.000Z	cypher1	mustiy	i think it has to do with the keys maintained by APT.. you can find more about it in "man apt-key"
2007-03-15T11:15:00.000Z	cypher1	mustiy	i have not personally tried it so cannot give a quicker answer.. but the manpage should help you a lot
2007-03-15T11:15:00.000Z	mustiy	cypher1	okay i guess, i'll see what the above mentioned command gives me - i just want to know why earlier it worked and now it doesnt =(
2007-03-15T11:16:00.000Z	cypher1	mustiy	probably the key got changed ?
2007-03-15T11:16:00.000Z	mustiy	cypher1	Good call, hehe
2007-03-15T11:16:00.000Z	cypher1	mustiy	which repo is giving that error ? can you paste the output ?
2007-03-15T11:17:00.000Z	mustiy	cypher1	sure.
2007-03-15T11:21:00.000Z	mustiy	cypher1	Sorry, this is taking longer then usual... Not really sure why heh, one more minute please.
2007-03-15T11:22:00.000Z	cypher1	mustiy	ok
2007-03-15T11:26:00.000Z	mustiy	cypher1	im trying to load those repository's so i can install the older version of Beryl
2007-03-15T11:27:00.000Z	cypher1	mustiy	non-official repo's usually needs a key to be added to avoid the types of error you are seeing
2007-03-15T11:27:00.000Z	cypher1	mustiy	it will be mentioned mostly in the webpage
2007-03-15T11:28:00.000Z	cypher1	mustiy	no i just mentioned.. i am not sure the beryl repo's are ubuntu hosted or not.. you can think on those lines and may correct the warning you are seeing
2007-03-15T11:28:00.000Z	cypher1	mustiy	also the message can be ignored and the installation done if you want
2007-03-15T11:29:00.000Z	mustiy	cypher1	installation is a no go, i get a error in the lines of "cannot find beryl<version #>" etc etc
2007-03-15T11:52:00.000Z	cypher1	mustiy	why are you mentioning a specific version ?
2007-03-15T11:53:00.000Z	mustiy	cypher1	because i dont want to install the latest version of Beryl (it causes a lot of problems, for a lot of people - specifically the white screen problem). I want to install 1 older version.
2007-03-15T11:54:00.000Z	cypher1	mustiy	ok
