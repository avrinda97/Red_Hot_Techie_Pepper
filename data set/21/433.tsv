2012-05-08T18:28:00.000Z	gaelfx		I'm installing Wine in software center, but it seems to be stuck at a certain point in "applying changes," what should I do?
2012-05-08T18:30:00.000Z	gwelter	gaelfx	wine pulls in a lot of dependancies, give it some time. it might also popped up a windows for accepting some eula
2012-05-08T18:31:00.000Z	gaelfx	gwelter	already popped that window, I accepted
2012-05-08T18:31:00.000Z	gaelfx	gwelter	and it's been stuck for a good 20 minutes
2012-05-08T18:32:00.000Z	gwelter	gaelfx	hmm, that's not right
2012-05-08T18:33:00.000Z	gwelter	gaelfx	if you're really sure it has stopped, cancel the install, stop the software center and install wine from a terminal to see what happens
2012-05-08T18:34:00.000Z	gaelfx	gwelter	how do I cancel the install? there's no X button next to it :/
2012-05-08T18:35:00.000Z	gwelter	gaelfx	no cancel button next to the progress bar?
2012-05-08T18:35:00.000Z	gaelfx	gwelter	correct
2012-05-08T18:35:00.000Z	gwelter	gaelfx	k, just quit software center and install from the command line
2012-05-08T18:37:00.000Z	gaelfx	gwelter	yeah, but quitting software center doesn't actually stop the install, so I can't get lock on whatever
2012-05-08T18:37:00.000Z	gwelter	gaelfx	you mean apt-get can't get a lock using sudo?
2012-05-08T18:39:00.000Z	gaelfx	gwelter	yeah, but I pkilled update notifier and package-data-do
2012-05-08T18:39:00.000Z	gaelfx	gwelter	so apt-get is running now
2012-05-08T18:39:00.000Z	gwelter	gaelfx	ok...
2012-05-08T18:40:00.000Z	gaelfx	gwelter	apparently, it's getting stuck on downloading the mscorefonts or whatever, from sourceforge (I'm behind GFW, so this crap happens all the time)
2012-05-08T18:42:00.000Z	gwelter	gaelfx	ahh, that explains it. maybe retrying hits another mirror that is reachable?
2012-05-08T18:43:00.000Z	gaelfx	gwelter	ttf-mscorefonts-installer: downloading http://downloads.sourceforge.net/corefonts/andale32.exe and nothing after that, seems like it's just not gonna get it
2012-05-08T18:44:00.000Z	gaelfx		vpn time
2012-05-08T18:45:00.000Z	gwelter	gaelfx	other that using an open proxy, i wouldn't know how to fix that
2012-05-08T18:46:00.000Z	gwelter	gaelfx	or vpn as you said :)
