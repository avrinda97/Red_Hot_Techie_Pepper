2006-04-27T14:20:00.000Z	Jinkguns		Why is my Cd-RW/Dvd-rom drive listing a dvd as a cd-rom? It also can't open it, I installed the css decoder package. :/

2006-04-27T14:23:00.000Z	Jinkguns		I'm probably just going to load window home on this laptop, the wireless and dvd play are too much trouble.
2006-04-27T14:24:00.000Z	Jinkguns		I'm going to start saving up for a System 76 laptop. (ubuntu installed)
2006-04-27T14:24:00.000Z	kaur		wireless shouldn't be hard under dapper
2006-04-27T14:24:00.000Z	Jinkguns	kaur	it's a BROADCOM 4306, the horror. :)
