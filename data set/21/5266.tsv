2007-11-22T00:17:00.000Z	ikonia	romme	you don't change your mac adddress
2007-11-22T00:17:00.000Z	romme	ikonia	it's not registered at my isp. i bought a new laptop so it has another mac address.
2007-11-22T00:17:00.000Z	ikonia	romme	speak to your ip
2007-11-22T00:17:00.000Z	ikonia	romme	isp

2007-11-22T00:20:00.000Z	romme	ikonia	what's bad in changing the mac address if it works and i'm doing it legally?
2007-11-22T00:20:00.000Z	ikonia	romme	doing it legally ?
2007-11-22T00:21:00.000Z	romme	ikonia	i told, i bought a new laptop today and installing ubuntu on it. my isp bound me to my old machine's mac address, so while i was in the preinstalled windows vista, i changed my mac address and it worked.
2007-11-22T00:22:00.000Z	ikonia	romme	register your ip address with your isp
2007-11-22T00:22:00.000Z	romme	ikonia	why just won't you say that you don't know how to do that?
2007-11-22T00:27:00.000Z	ikonia	romme	stop trying to change your mac address
2007-11-22T00:28:00.000Z	ikonia	romme	this is ubuntu support - nothing to do with mac address changing, can you please drop the topic
2007-12-03T21:15:00.000Z	ikonia	romme	why would you want that ?
2007-12-03T21:15:00.000Z	romme	ikonia	i want my hard drive to remain standby for most of the time
2007-12-03T21:15:00.000Z	ikonia	romme	not really then
