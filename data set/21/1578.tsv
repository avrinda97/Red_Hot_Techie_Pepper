2010-08-16T01:50:00.000Z	thewanderer1		how can I install Ubuntu on a pendrive? how much space do I need?
2010-08-16T01:52:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	thewanderer1	do you want a LiveCD type environment on the USB key or a real install onto a USB key?
2010-08-16T01:53:00.000Z	thewanderer1	ZykoticK9	an install - and yes, I'm aware of flash wear or w/e, I will handle that stuff
2010-08-16T01:54:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	thewanderer1	do a regular install and select it as the install drive - BUT you need to click "advanced" and select to install GRUB onto the USB key if you want to select it to boot from BIOS (understand that part?  might not be clear)
2010-08-16T01:55:00.000Z	thewanderer1	ZykoticK9	yes, well, I can manage GRUB, I only needed to know if this is possible in a straightforward way
2010-08-16T01:55:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	thewanderer1	if you want a LiveCD type then use unetbootin or startup disk creator as suggseted by others
2010-08-16T01:55:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	thewanderer1	both ways are "pretty" straight forward actually
2010-08-16T01:55:00.000Z	thewanderer1	ZykoticK9	not really, I want a persistent install so that I can store files, packages, and tweak settings
2010-08-16T01:56:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	thewanderer1	if you want persistent then i'd recommend using the Ubuntu Startup Disk creator over unetbootin
2010-08-16T01:56:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	thewanderer1	persitent != install
2010-08-16T01:57:00.000Z	thewanderer1	ZykoticK9	I thought it would give me an overlay so that all my files and settings are kept, like an aufs branch mounted over my root filesystem that uses some writable directory as the backing store
2010-08-16T01:58:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	thewanderer1	some of the USB key is used to store files/data
2010-08-16T01:58:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	thewanderer1	you can perform a regular install onto the USB - just do the Grub manual thing
2010-08-16T01:59:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	thewanderer1	that's want i'm talking about grub
2010-08-16T01:59:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	thewanderer1	just click on "advanced" and manually point grub to the usb during install!
2010-08-16T02:00:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	thewanderer1	you'd need 2 USB drives
2010-08-16T02:00:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	thewanderer1	did you say you have no optical drive?
2010-08-16T02:01:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	thewanderer1	then you'd need 2 usb drives to do anything.  good luck man :)
2010-08-16T02:10:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	thewanderer1	sarah32 actually i doubt ubuntu would run on a true 386 these days
2010-08-16T02:10:00.000Z	thewanderer1	ZykoticK9	alright, i387 :P
2010-08-16T02:12:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	thewanderer1	in Ubuntu the i386 is really i686
