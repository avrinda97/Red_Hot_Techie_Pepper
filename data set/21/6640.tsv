2007-03-07T08:16:00.000Z	skiloup		Are there known problems with Edgy handling SATA controllers or SATA drives?
2007-03-07T08:16:00.000Z	soundray	skiloup	some very recent chipset may cause trouble, but generally SATA support is very good
2007-03-07T08:18:00.000Z	soundray	skiloup	to see currently available modules, do 'ls :/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/scsi/sata*'
2007-03-07T08:18:00.000Z	skiloup	soundray	I have this controller:  Intel Corporation 82801GBM/GHM (ICH7 Family) Serial ATA Storage Controller IDE (rev 01)  and I am getting i/o error messages when I $dmesg
2007-03-07T08:19:00.000Z	soundray	skiloup	it
2007-03-07T08:19:00.000Z	soundray	skiloup	it's a supported chipset
2007-03-07T08:20:00.000Z	soundray	skiloup	I/O errors could mean that your hard disk drive is dying.
2007-03-07T08:21:00.000Z	skiloup	soundray	It's a brand new laptop, so before I sent it back to have the hd replaced, I wanted to make sure that I'm not using a wrong kernel module, or have software problems I haven't resolved yet
2007-03-07T08:22:00.000Z	soundray	skiloup	are you using ubuntu 6.10?
2007-03-07T08:22:00.000Z	skiloup	soundray	yes, with kernel version 2.6.17.10-generic
2007-03-07T08:23:00.000Z	skiloup	soundray	not 17-11 because I ran into problems getting my vid and wifi to work at the same time with it
2007-03-07T08:23:00.000Z	soundray	skiloup	there have been some changes in the way the kernel addresses SATA drives between 2.6.17 and 2.6.20. Perhaps you want to try the Feisty (7.04) beta live CD before you send the laptop back.
2007-03-07T08:24:00.000Z	soundray	skiloup	no pasting here!
2007-03-07T08:24:00.000Z	soundray	skiloup	what do you think you're doing?
2007-03-07T08:29:00.000Z	skiloup	soundray	Aside from my goof on the large paste, are there any tools I can run to check my drive for bad sectors?  If so, i could manually flag the appropriate blocks
2007-03-07T08:31:00.000Z	soundray	skiloup	manual badblocks marking is obsolete with modern drives. I'd use the beta, mount the drive and run some HD thrashing tasks while observing syslog.
2007-03-07T08:32:00.000Z	skiloup	soundray	the beta? beta for what?
2007-03-07T08:32:00.000Z	soundray	skiloup	ubuntu. See private message...
2007-03-07T08:34:00.000Z	skiloup	soundray	alright, sounds good.  Funny i didn't think of the new fiesty, I was gonna use Knoppix
2007-03-07T08:34:00.000Z	soundray	skiloup	I think that would be just as good
2007-03-07T08:35:00.000Z	skiloup	soundray	thanks for the help, out of curiosity, where can I find a list of common messages, like the fiesty message you redirected me?
