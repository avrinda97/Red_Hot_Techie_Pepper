2008-09-12T11:15:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	Flannel	that guide won't help much as he has a drive that already has XP on it i think?
2008-09-12T11:16:00.000Z	Flannel	ushimitsudoki	It will.
2008-09-22T06:27:00.000Z	Flannel	ushimitsudoki	That's entirely wrong.
2008-09-22T06:27:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	Flannel	no it is not. i have don't it myself and it is also referenced: http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/kde and many other places
2008-09-22T06:28:00.000Z	Flannel	ushimitsudoki	apt-get has autoremove now, which does a better job of aptitude, and doesn't require you to use aptitude for everything.
2008-09-22T06:28:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	Flannel	Listen. Do it. Install a -desktop packaged with apt-get and then apt-remove it. Look at all the packages it will remove.
2008-09-22T06:29:00.000Z	Flannel	ushimitsudoki	You're not listening.  You need to use autoremove to remove them, and it *does* work.  Better than aptitude, and again, aptitude's ability to do that breaks if you use something else (like synaptic, etc) to install things like that.
2008-09-22T06:34:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	Flannel	The point I am trying to make is if you apt-get install a -desktop package, then apt-get remove is borked. Is this correct or incorrect?
2008-09-22T06:35:00.000Z	Flannel	ushimitsudoki	that's incorrect.
2008-09-22T06:35:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	Flannel	so apt-get remove kde-desktop will work just fine? That is not my experience with kde-desktop or ubuntustudio-desktop. When or what changed?
2008-09-22T06:36:00.000Z	Flannel	ushimitsudoki	I've mentioned it a few times.  You use autoremove.
2008-09-22T06:36:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	Flannel	So, "apt-get remove" doesn't work? That is what I am saying
2008-09-22T06:36:00.000Z	Flannel	ushimitsudoki	It accomplishes a different task.
2008-09-22T06:36:00.000Z	Flannel	ushimitsudoki	It's not *supposed* to remove all the depends.
2008-09-22T06:37:00.000Z	Flannel	ushimitsudoki	it works just fine.  It just doesn't do what *you* think it ought to do.
2008-09-22T06:39:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	Flannel	I think most people expect "apt-get remove" to remove what "apt-get install" installed. And if they try that with the -desktop packages the result will be unexpected. I do not think most people will try "apt-get autoremove" in this case. That is my point, and I think it stands
2008-09-22T06:41:00.000Z	Flannel	ushimitsudoki	remove won't remove everything that's installed anyway, because it'll leave configuation files, etc.  There is no benefit to using aptitude anymore, and what benefit it historically had wasn't valid if you wanted to use other (synaptic) tools anyway.
2008-09-22T06:41:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	Flannel	I appreciate that, but it has no bearing on the point I am trying to make. Thank you for your input, I am done with this topic.
2008-09-22T06:42:00.000Z	Flannel	ushimitsudoki	Again, your point was invalid and misleading to people who just want their stuff to work.
