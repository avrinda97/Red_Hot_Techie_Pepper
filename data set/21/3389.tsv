2009-03-24T18:27:00.000Z	badboy_		Hi can anybody help me please, my external is not being mounted, it's formatted to ext3
2009-03-24T18:27:00.000Z	badboy_		my sudo fdisk -l see it
2009-03-24T18:28:00.000Z	badboy_		/dev/sdb1               1      267349  2147480811    7  HPFS/NTFS
2009-03-24T18:29:00.000Z	badboy_		how to mount it?
2009-03-24T18:30:00.000Z	oCean_	badboy_	well, that does not really seem like ext3, is it? It says NTFS
2009-03-24T18:30:00.000Z	badboy_		I thought i formatted it to ext3
2009-03-24T18:30:00.000Z	badboy_		Something is wrong
2009-03-24T18:31:00.000Z	oCean_	badboy_	Yes, so I can tell you how to mount it using NTFS, but maybe you want to format it ext3 anyway?
2009-03-24T18:31:00.000Z	badboy_		I used partition manager to format it to ext3, but now i see it's still ntfs. well suku, my objective is to format it to XFS
2009-03-24T18:32:00.000Z	badboy_		I tried to used gparted live cd, but it could see it
2009-03-24T18:33:00.000Z	badboy_		Suku, that's the reason I tried to format it to ext3 first, now I see it's not been done
2009-03-24T18:34:00.000Z	badboy_		Ok, is there a way to run gparted from ubuntu directly?
2009-03-24T18:34:00.000Z	oCean_	badboy_	yes. System menu > administration > partition editor
2009-03-24T18:37:00.000Z	badboy_		ocean and suku, I see it now from the drop down menu. But unfortunately the XFS is grey out
2009-03-24T18:38:00.000Z	badboy_	suku	how to do that?
2009-03-24T18:38:00.000Z	oCean_	badboy_	suku it is called "xfsprogs", and yes it is in the repos
2009-03-24T18:39:00.000Z	badboy_		got it now, downloading it
2009-03-24T18:40:00.000Z	badboy_		thanks guys, downloaded it already and installed, last thing, how to run the xfs program?
2009-03-24T18:41:00.000Z	oCean_	badboy_	program?
2009-03-24T18:41:00.000Z	badboy_		xfs tools?
2009-03-24T18:42:00.000Z	oCean_	badboy_	on commandline do a "dpkg -L xfsprogs" and you will see all related commands. Like xfs_copy, xfs_admin, xfs_check etc
