2006-01-01T15:03:00.000Z	john_		anyone know that "lo" is on the network interfaces?
2006-01-01T15:04:00.000Z	john_		well something strange is happening....
2006-01-01T15:04:00.000Z	hunger	john_	It is used so that your computer can talk to itself.
2006-01-01T15:23:00.000Z	hunger	john_	Yes.
2006-01-01T15:24:00.000Z	hunger	john_	No idea, I use fish:-)
2006-01-01T15:25:00.000Z	hunger	john_	Haven't tried, but I doubt it.
2006-01-01T15:25:00.000Z	hunger	john_	How are you setting up the connection?
2006-01-01T15:26:00.000Z	john_	hunger	bear in mind im a newbie.....
2006-01-01T15:26:00.000Z	john_	hunger	I mounted the windows server 2003 share using mkdir /mnt/<name-of-mount-point>
2006-01-01T15:26:00.000Z	hunger	john_	So what? So am I (wrt. Samba at least)
2006-01-01T15:27:00.000Z	john_	hunger	then mount -t smbfs -o username=<username>,password=<password> //<win-box>/<share> /mnt/<name-of-mountpoint>
2006-01-01T15:27:00.000Z	hunger	john_	That works? mkdir does create a directory, nothing more.
2006-01-01T15:28:00.000Z	hunger	john_	Good! Have you tried adding that to /etc/fstab? That is a table which lists all the filesystems the system knows (and only those can be mounted at bootup).
2006-01-01T15:29:00.000Z	hunger	john_	fstab needs exactly the information from your mount command. The formatting is a bit different, but I am sure you can figure it out.
2006-01-01T15:29:00.000Z	john_	hunger	yes I did but everytime I boot it asks for a password now
2006-01-01T15:30:00.000Z	hunger	john_	Read the man page for mount. (man mount in the terminal).
2006-01-01T15:30:00.000Z	john_	hunger	every time I try to use root i get sudo: unable to lookup ubuntu via gethostbyname()
2006-01-01T15:30:00.000Z	hunger	john_	You can either add a option for the password or use credentials.
2006-01-01T16:17:00.000Z	hunger	john_	Is there a line starting with 127.0.0.1?
2006-01-02T10:10:00.000Z	hunger	john_	No. VMware does not support Direct3D AFAIK.
