2008-08-23T00:36:00.000Z	Terrasque	DigitalNinja	I would recommend making your own repository, and make a deb file that installs that repository
2008-08-23T00:37:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	Terrasque	Hmmm.... Sounds like a lot of extra work. I'll look into it.
2008-08-23T00:41:00.000Z	Terrasque	DigitalNinja	in theory, all your .deb package needs to do to install a repository is to drop a file in /etc/apt/sources.list.d and add a gpg key.
2008-08-23T00:43:00.000Z	Terrasque	DigitalNinja	as for making a repository, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Personal
2008-08-23T00:44:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	Terrasque	I see. Well, sort of.
2008-08-23T00:45:00.000Z	Terrasque	DigitalNinja	making a repository, adding all stuff in debs, and then making a meta package to pull all the needed is the "correct" way of doing it, I think. Then you only have to worry about your part :)
2008-08-23T00:46:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	Terrasque	Now I'm confused. Are you say all the ubuntu packages need to be in the repository or just my packages?
2008-08-23T00:47:00.000Z	Terrasque	DigitalNinja	if you, instead of making a modified cd, make your own repository, then you only need to put your stuff there, and support your stuff.
2008-08-23T00:48:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	Terrasque	I think in this case a custom CD is the way to go. I just want to make sure I follow the rules for a new distro. Assuming one can call it a new distro.
2008-08-23T00:49:00.000Z	Terrasque	DigitalNinja	ok. your choice of course :) But personally I think overall work would be less with deb repository. But its of course your choice. I don't know your situation in detail
2008-08-23T00:51:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	Terrasque	Truth is I have no idea what I'm getting my self into. I'v modified a server CD in the past but that didn't include deb packages.
2008-08-23T00:53:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	Terrasque	I just had the install CD auto install a few packages etc... Plus a deb package that is not included in the repositories.
2008-08-23T00:54:00.000Z	Terrasque	DigitalNinja	ok
2008-08-23T00:55:00.000Z	Terrasque	DigitalNinja	to get completely automatic install you have to modify the cd
2008-08-23T00:58:00.000Z	Terrasque	DigitalNinja	half-automated (and simple) solution: make a shell script that installs and tweaks things as neccesary, put it on a web server, and just do "wget http://server/script.sh -o /tmp/runit.sh && bash /tmp/runit.sh"
2008-08-23T00:59:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	Terrasque	Hmmm... Nice idea. Copying your command for future use.
2008-08-23T01:01:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	Terrasque	I don't know if I have the skills to do it but I would like to say I maintain my own Linux distro. It's the geek in me.
2008-08-23T01:02:00.000Z	Terrasque	DigitalNinja	oh, a typo there, its wget -O not wget -o
2008-08-23T01:03:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	Terrasque	Got it!
2008-08-23T01:06:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	Terrasque	Now that I think about it your wget command would be a great way to test things. I could configure one CD to access the script. Any changes I make to the script would be downloaded the next time I install. Nice!
2008-08-23T01:07:00.000Z	Terrasque	DigitalNinja	yes, that is a very good solution actually :) Been thinking of something like that, but haven't really had the need for it
