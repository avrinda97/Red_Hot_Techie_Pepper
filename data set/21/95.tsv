2012-09-12T00:27:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	iNTEl_	personally I don't pm's and really are not your best help altogether. ;)
2012-09-12T00:28:00.000Z	iNTEl_	wilee-nilee	, there is a step its changing the user name
2012-09-12T00:28:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	iNTEl_	as far as all the steps follow the directions would be your only method, you are trying to change the password.
