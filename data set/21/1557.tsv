2010-07-28T02:46:00.000Z	Out-Of-Hand		hello all
2010-07-28T02:46:00.000Z	Out-Of-Hand		can someone assit me ... im trying to install ubuntu 10.04 , but i keep getting  stuck
2010-07-28T02:46:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Out-Of-Hand	stuck where?
2010-07-28T02:48:00.000Z	Out-Of-Hand		Aeon-ltd.... thanks , i have installed ubuntu within windows xp(yuck) and when it askes me to reboot to install ... i reboot.... but when i let it choose ubuntu opr windows... i choose ubuntu ... and it counts down ( 5 -4 3-2-1) then it sticks on 0.... i then reboot and tried it in safe graphics and it gets to a point where it stops .. i got a photo of the image
2010-07-28T02:49:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Out-Of-Hand	wubi probably messed up, i would reccommend getting a fresh iso and properly dual boot
2010-07-28T02:49:00.000Z	Out-Of-Hand	aeon-ltd	 there is one other thing
2010-07-28T02:50:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Out-Of-Hand	go on...
2010-07-28T02:50:00.000Z	Out-Of-Hand		when i installed XP from fresh... it gets stuck too ... i have to bypass windows (blue screen detecting and installing devices)
2010-07-28T02:50:00.000Z	Out-Of-Hand		i have to press F10 and delete the CPU.INF file
2010-07-28T02:50:00.000Z	Out-Of-Hand		to let windows continue installing
2010-07-28T02:51:00.000Z	Out-Of-Hand		my mother board is a Foxcon Intel
2010-07-28T02:51:00.000Z	Out-Of-Hand		coult that be an issue ?> i did have ubuntu working b4 though
2010-07-28T02:52:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Out-Of-Hand	i don't know how to fix the win problem. but it shouldn't be a problem, the hdd sounds fine, more likely a install media problem
2010-07-28T02:53:00.000Z	Out-Of-Hand		yeah im using windows now... but i had to alter my windows installation ....  anyways ... um ... i tried safe graphics  . and i get the following where the boot hags
2010-07-28T02:54:00.000Z	Out-Of-Hand		isapnp " no plug and play device found
2010-07-28T02:54:00.000Z	Out-Of-Hand		and it hangs
2010-07-28T02:55:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Out-Of-Hand	it does seem like wubi messed up on the iso download
2010-07-28T02:56:00.000Z	Out-Of-Hand		ok ... so i should try download again ....   ? another thing ... whenh oi first got this pc ... i formatted the HDD and booted off a live cd ubuntu 9.04  worked like a charm ... i then deleted it and then installed windows.... but then when i tried to install ubuntu again though windows .... i get stuck same issue ? would that have anything to do with it ?
2010-07-28T02:59:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Out-Of-Hand	wubi is just crap, you should stick to regualer isos and proper dual booting to ensure maxmimum stability
2010-07-28T02:59:00.000Z	Out-Of-Hand		is there any way i can see if my Ubuntu.iso  is fully downloaded ...... the wubi comes in the iso i downloaded
2010-07-28T03:00:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Out-Of-Hand	you can just downlooad regular isos yourself put them in the same directory as wubi and wubi will use them
