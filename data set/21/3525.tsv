2008-12-02T07:17:00.000Z	linux29684		does anyone know when bluetooth will be fixed on intrepid?
2008-12-02T07:18:00.000Z	test34	linux29684	let me know if you find out
2008-12-02T07:19:00.000Z	linux29684	test34	I wish someone would know the answer to that, it seems everyone can not get bluetooth working on intrepid
2008-12-02T07:21:00.000Z	test34	linux29684	I think the problem is that bt-audio became obsolete
2008-12-02T07:45:00.000Z	test34	linux29684	in the bluetooth preferences, do you know what the key and the blue "I" mean ?
2008-12-02T07:46:00.000Z	linux29684	test34	there are no services in teh bluetooth preferences visible
2008-12-02T07:46:00.000Z	test34	linux29684	I can get my bluetooth headset paired.. but can't get it to work
2008-12-02T07:46:00.000Z	linux29684	test34	i can get no data communications with any bluetooth device; and definately no pairing
2008-12-02T07:48:00.000Z	test34	linux29684	what do you get in dmesg when connecting your bluetooth adapter if its USB
2008-12-02T07:51:00.000Z	test34	linux29684	have you tried the latest version of bluez
2008-12-02T07:51:00.000Z	test34	linux29684	I didnt try the latest version, but that's what I'm going to try next
2008-12-02T07:52:00.000Z	linux29684	test34	tried the lastest version of bluez, it comes with intrepid, even tried to compile it
2008-12-02T07:52:00.000Z	test34	linux29684	my intrepid doesnt come with the latest version
2008-12-02T07:53:00.000Z	linux29684	test34	bluez4 is the latest version?
2008-12-02T07:54:00.000Z	test34	linux29684	4.21, not 4.12 (the latest one in the official repository)
2008-12-02T07:54:00.000Z	linux29684	test34	please lead me to download *.deb for bluez 4.21
2008-12-02T07:54:00.000Z	test34	linux29684	I didn't find a .deb yet.. only source from http://bluez.org
2008-12-02T07:55:00.000Z	linux29684	test34	i tried to compile the 3.x when 4.x didn't work i think
2008-12-02T07:57:00.000Z	test34	linux29684	I havent tried that but I had the microphone working on my bluetooth headset for a while.. but never the headphone.... I think I had the bt-audio obsolete package installed..
2008-12-02T07:57:00.000Z	linux29684	test34	you download just the bluez-4.21.tar.gz, or all other firmware/hcidump/etc
2008-12-02T07:58:00.000Z	test34	linux29684	they are probably all required but I'm not sure, I didnt install it yet
