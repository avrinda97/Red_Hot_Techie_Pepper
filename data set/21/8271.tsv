2010-10-02T03:26:00.000Z	ikonia	owner	you mount a partition, not a disk
2010-10-02T03:26:00.000Z	ikonia	owner	sda is a disk, sda1(2,3,4) is a partition
2010-10-02T03:32:00.000Z	ikonia	owner	there are no partitions on that isk
2010-10-02T03:53:00.000Z	ikonia	owner	this is nothing to do with ubuntu
2010-10-02T03:54:00.000Z	ikonia	owner	get a windows disk and boot from that if you want to install windows
2010-10-02T03:54:00.000Z	ikonia	owner	ok - you need to install windows first
2010-10-02T03:54:00.000Z	ikonia	owner	get a windows install CD and boot from that
2010-10-02T03:54:00.000Z	ikonia	owner	the windows install CD will do that
2010-10-03T02:39:00.000Z	ikonia	owner	you have no unalloctaed space on the drive
2010-10-03T02:49:00.000Z	ikonia	owner	if you have unallocated space the ubuntu installer should allow you to install dual boot
2010-10-06T19:36:00.000Z	ikonia	owner	side by side ?
