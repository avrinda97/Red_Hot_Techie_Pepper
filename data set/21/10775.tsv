2005-05-04T12:40:00.000Z	karljp		I guess iriver has had a hard time keeping up.
2005-05-04T12:40:00.000Z	karljp		irivers do yes
2005-05-04T12:41:00.000Z	karljp		why just ogg players?
2005-05-04T12:42:00.000Z	karljp		oh, you mean ogg players that don't play anything else.
2005-05-04T12:42:00.000Z	karljp		perhaps, but would you buy one?
2005-05-04T12:42:00.000Z	karljp		I sure as hell wouldn't
2005-05-04T12:43:00.000Z	karljp		fair enough I guess :)
2005-05-04T12:43:00.000Z	karljp		it's going to be pretty damn tough to try and unseat mp3,
2005-05-04T12:43:00.000Z	karljp		windows and apple are trying hard, by pretending that aac and wmv are just like mp3, and hiding it from people, and supporting both,
2005-05-04T12:44:00.000Z	karljp		yeah, I've only ever bought mp3s, even when offered all sorts of choices.
2005-05-04T12:44:00.000Z	Xenguy	karljp	spread the word about OGG; not enough people know yet
2005-05-04T12:50:00.000Z	Xenguy	karljp	Iceland is cracking down on P2P?
2005-05-04T12:52:00.000Z	Xenguy	karljp	(use nick tab completion?) easier to track than P2P I assume
2005-05-04T12:54:00.000Z	Xenguy	karljp	juse nick completion, since I might actually see your comments whilst participating in a dozen channels or so =)
2005-05-04T12:54:00.000Z	Xenguy	karljp	no
2005-05-04T12:55:00.000Z	Xenguy	karljp	yet you assert that actually using someone's nick is "evil" -- why then?
2005-05-04T12:55:00.000Z	Xenguy	karljp	?
2005-05-04T12:56:00.000Z	Xenguy	karljp	I have no idea what you're talking about; furthermore I have never heard anyone object to nick completion before, for *any* reason.  (Perhaps you need to get a different IRC client?)
2005-05-04T12:57:00.000Z	Xenguy	karljp	I'm focusing on you for the moment, but not for long ;-)
2005-05-04T14:08:00.000Z	Xenguy	karljp	their own thing AFAIK
2005-05-04T14:08:00.000Z	Xenguy	karljp	it's very proprietary
