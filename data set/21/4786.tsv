2009-12-01T22:22:00.000Z	subichan		as the gui interface to ubuntu just froze could anybody tell me how to reset it?
2009-12-01T22:23:00.000Z	subichan		after i clicked on the time to reset it the upper and lower bars froze
2009-12-01T22:24:00.000Z	subichan		or at least if somebody could tell me how to log off or reset my machine through the terminal i'd be grateful as well
2009-12-01T22:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	subichan	 reboot command.. or try alt-ctrl-sysreq-k to force X to restart
2009-12-01T22:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	subichan	 or 'sudo service gdm restart' to r4estart x
2009-12-01T22:25:00.000Z	subichan	Dr_Willis	service not found
2009-12-01T22:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	subichan	 perhaps its sudo service restart gdm , or are you using 9,10 or 9.04 ?
2009-12-01T22:27:00.000Z	subichan	Dr_Willis	i'll try rebooting.. thanks..
2009-12-01T22:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	subichan	 or try the alt-ctrl-sysreq-k key combo
2009-12-22T18:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	subichan	 i would think a 160gb log file would be a little extreme
2009-12-22T18:53:00.000Z	subichan	Dr_Willis	after seeing the structure of the logfile i can't be sure anymore ..
2009-12-22T18:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	subichan	 pipe it to /dev/null :)
2009-12-22T18:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	subichan	 pipe it to /dev/lpr  :)
2009-12-22T18:54:00.000Z	subichan	Dr_Willis	is that the printer?!
2009-12-22T18:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	subichan	 ages ago it was.. i think. :) old skool
2009-12-22T19:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	subichan	 once the release gets so old. i THink the repos get moved to some 'archive.ubuntu.com' or similery named  server
2009-12-22T19:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	subichan	 change your sources.list
2009-12-22T19:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	subichan	 i was thinking that was a feature of ext4
2009-12-22T19:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	subichan	 check the ext4 wiki page
2010-04-13T20:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	subichan	 you mean what its doing? its setting a variable.
