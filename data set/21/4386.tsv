2008-08-26T09:26:00.000Z	gaintsura		ahh ok thx
2008-08-26T09:27:00.000Z	gaintsura		is there a way to step up anti-aliasing <ATI> for full screen video without catalyst?
2008-08-26T09:28:00.000Z	bobertdos	gaintsura	Have you installed the restricted drivers? Otherwise, you could install the proprietary ones from ATI........
2008-08-26T09:29:00.000Z	gaintsura	bobertdos	yes I've installed those
2008-08-26T09:29:00.000Z	bobertdos	gaintsura	which ones?
2008-08-26T09:29:00.000Z	gaintsura	bobertdos	ATI catalyst keeps telling me that the driver is not configured
2008-08-26T09:29:00.000Z	gaintsura	bobertdos	not sure really, it was a couple of months ago
2008-08-26T09:30:00.000Z	bobertdos	gaintsura	Oh, you've tried to run ATI's installer, right?
2008-08-26T09:30:00.000Z	gaintsura	bobertdos	 its installed and I configured xorg.conf for compiz
2008-08-26T09:31:00.000Z	bobertdos	gaintsura	Does glxinfo or fglrxinfo tell you direct rendering is enabled? (in the terminal)
2008-08-26T09:32:00.000Z	gaintsura	bobertdos	no it is not enabled =(
2008-08-26T09:33:00.000Z	bobertdos	gaintsura	Well, given that you've already installed and configured the drivers, I don't know if this will work well for you, but the REAL way to install the ATI drivers is in the wiki.
2008-08-26T09:34:00.000Z	gaintsura	bobertdos	care to point me to the wiki wiki?
2008-08-26T09:36:00.000Z	bobertdos	gaintsura	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI -- It can be a pretty risky thing to do if you've already tried to install them before, but you can give it a shot.
2008-08-26T09:43:00.000Z	gaintsura	bobertdos	I've actually been through almost all of that, I didn't see much difference
2008-08-26T09:44:00.000Z	bobertdos	gaintsura	and fglrxinfo still gives you indirect rendering?
2008-08-26T09:45:00.000Z	gaintsura	bobertdos	 yes, not direct
2008-08-26T09:47:00.000Z	bobertdos	gaintsura	Well, if nothing changes after a reboot, this might be a little difficult to troubleshoot. I can tell you from doing it myself that it does work pretty well from a clean install.
2008-08-26T09:48:00.000Z	gaintsura	bobertdos	the weird thing is... I installed catalyst like 4 months ago and it worked fine, since then a plethora of upgrades and now it doesn't work, no new upgrades in about a week
2008-08-26T09:50:00.000Z	bobertdos	gaintsura	Well, I'm guessing one or more of those upgrades changed Xorg or some of the open source drivers and now they're probably butting heads, 'ya know?
