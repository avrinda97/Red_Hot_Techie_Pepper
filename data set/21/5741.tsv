2007-08-20T14:15:00.000Z	t0nedef		dariuskana yes, that one is great, i run that one like 3 or 4 times on the same disk
2007-08-20T14:15:00.000Z	dariuskane	t0nedef	if you got time to spare... a week-ish go for /dev/random :)
2007-08-20T14:15:00.000Z	t0nedef	dariuskane	nah, not that much time on my hands
2007-08-20T14:15:00.000Z	dariuskane	t0nedef	me either :P
2007-08-20T14:17:00.000Z	dariuskane	t0nedef	last time I did /dev/urandom on my old slow P3 w/80g it took just about an entire day :P
2007-08-20T14:18:00.000Z	t0nedef	dariuskane	nuts, thats slow
2007-08-20T14:19:00.000Z	dariuskane	t0nedef	it was... they are old drives.. 1.1mb/s and 1.3 mb/s... onlyhave to do it once though
2007-08-20T14:20:00.000Z	dariuskane	t0nedef	my current pet project is a complete secure reinstall with ubuntu...its been problematic
2007-08-20T14:21:00.000Z	t0nedef	dariuskane	you got a website or a place that i can look at what your doing with it?
2007-08-20T14:22:00.000Z	dariuskane	t0nedef	not yet... Im an oldskool slackware user just starting with ubuntu in anticipation of the new packaging changes in Gutsy so Im still muddling through the new filesystem layout and tools
2007-08-20T14:23:00.000Z	t0nedef	dariuskane	i started out on freebsd and slackware when you still had to install from floppy
2007-08-20T14:23:00.000Z	dariuskane	t0nedef	lol yup same here... thank god for ftp installs after that
2007-08-20T14:23:00.000Z	t0nedef	dariuskane	and most distro's required you already had linux installed in order to set up
2007-08-20T14:24:00.000Z	t0nedef	dariuskane	that never made much sense to me
2007-08-20T14:24:00.000Z	dariuskane	t0nedef	if your really masochistic you could go for LFS distro and build an entire distro yourself
2007-08-20T14:25:00.000Z	dariuskane	t0nedef	lol I was thinking of trying it out for my laptop after this pet projects done :)
2007-08-20T14:26:00.000Z	t0nedef	dariuskane	if your using sda drives, you'll run into compiling issues, i don't know why yet
2007-08-20T14:27:00.000Z	dariuskane	t0nedef	Im sure that wont be the only issue.. along with wireless and hibernation to name a few
2007-08-20T14:27:00.000Z	t0nedef	dariuskane	hibernation yes, wireless not so much
2007-08-20T14:47:00.000Z	dariuskane	t0nedef	but its always so fleeting.. will they remember you next week :)
2007-08-20T14:47:00.000Z	t0nedef	dariuskane	well they forgot about me from last week till i started helping miku
