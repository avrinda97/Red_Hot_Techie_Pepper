2007-02-06T09:06:00.000Z	lightcap		why are packages typically held back when running apt-get upgrade?
2007-02-06T09:07:00.000Z	Vuen	lightcap	packages should not typically be held back. if something is held back, it's usually because there's a problem.
2007-02-06T09:07:00.000Z	lightcap	Vuen	so how do I debug that?
2007-02-06T09:08:00.000Z	Vuen	lightcap	mm, depends. what packages are being held back?
2007-02-06T09:11:00.000Z	Vuen	lightcap	hmm, that's really wierd. sorry, i don't know much about apt. the #debian crew might know more, they tend to be more technically adept >.<
2007-02-06T09:11:00.000Z	lightcap	Vuen	thanks
2007-02-06T09:14:00.000Z	Vuen	lightcap	try typing this: aptitude unhold *
2007-02-06T09:16:00.000Z	lightcap	Vuen	not sure I want that to work...I'm concerned with why it was done in the first place now...something must've broken and that looks like a quick fix
2007-02-06T09:16:00.000Z	Vuen	lightcap	well then i don't understand what you want us to help you with.
2007-02-06T09:17:00.000Z	Vuen	lightcap	you want to unhold everything except certain packages, but you don't know which ones?
2007-02-06T09:18:00.000Z	Vuen	lightcap	if this is an important box, like a corporate server or something, my suggestion is to just not upgrade. if you need the upgrades for some reason (most importantly security), then unhold * and upgrade. if something breaks, fix it, or roll it back.
2007-02-06T09:18:00.000Z	lightcap	Vuen	sorry, just trying to figure out why it would be held back...
2007-02-06T09:18:00.000Z	lightcap	Vuen	you're exactly right though.
2007-02-06T09:19:00.000Z	Vuen	lightcap	you can check the dpkg log files and the sudo audit file to see what apt commands have been used
2007-02-06T09:23:00.000Z	Vuen	lightcap	cat /var/log/auth.log|grep apt|less
2007-02-06T09:23:00.000Z	Vuen	lightcap	cat /var/log/auth.log.0|grep apt|less
2007-02-06T09:23:00.000Z	Vuen	lightcap	cat /var/log/auth.log.*.gz|gunzip|grep apt|less
2007-02-06T09:23:00.000Z	Vuen	lightcap	you can try grepping hold instead, might help
2007-02-06T09:28:00.000Z	lightcap	Vuen	nothing there that's interesting...
2007-02-06T09:28:00.000Z	lightcap	Vuen	I think it's a dist-upgrade issue...
2007-02-06T09:29:00.000Z	Vuen	lightcap	no problem
