2005-01-06T14:33:00.000Z	Scorp		I can't find fluxbox do I need to add a certain repository or the default ones enough?
2005-01-06T13:33:00.000Z	Scorp		someone told me how to make it so that my laptop brings up eth0 on boot last night but it doesn't seem to work, maybe I did something wrong, the network works once I type dhclient eth0
2005-01-06T13:35:00.000Z	Pozac	Scorp	'ifplugd' will bring up eth0 on cable insertion :)
2005-01-06T13:35:00.000Z	Scorp	Pozac	does that mean when it boots up if the cable is inserted it'll bring it up?
2005-01-06T13:36:00.000Z	Pozac	Scorp	I believe it will
2005-01-06T13:36:00.000Z	Scorp	Pozac	that sounds good ty
2005-01-06T13:38:00.000Z	Pozac	Scorp	that sounds odd .. what are you searching for?
2005-01-06T13:38:00.000Z	Pozac	Scorp	it might be in the unsupported Universe repository
2005-01-06T13:39:00.000Z	Scorp	Pozac	I believe so
2005-01-06T13:40:00.000Z	Pozac	Scorp	strange.. maybe it's a bug in synaptic
2005-01-06T13:41:00.000Z	Pozac	Scorp	doesn't happen here.. well, use sudo apt-get install ifplugd then
2005-01-06T13:42:00.000Z	Pozac	Scorp	aye
2005-01-06T13:44:00.000Z	Pozac	Scorp	man apt
2005-01-06T13:44:00.000Z	Pozac	Scorp	or man apt-get
2005-01-06T13:47:00.000Z	Pozac	Scorp	apt-get install build-essentail
2005-01-06T14:10:00.000Z	Pozac	Scorp	beep-media-player
2005-01-06T14:11:00.000Z	Scorp	Pozac	isn't that Xmms on gtk2?
2005-01-06T14:11:00.000Z	Pozac	Scorp	you can mount your windows shares as filesystems, then you can use xmms
2005-01-06T14:11:00.000Z	Pozac	Scorp	and gnome-vfs :)
2005-01-06T14:14:00.000Z	Pozac	Scorp	sudo mount -t smbfs //machine/share /mnt/point
2005-01-06T14:15:00.000Z	Pozac	Scorp	mount calls smbmount :)
