2005-09-06T12:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	puneypunk	did you enable "universe" ?
2005-09-06T12:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic	puneypunk	 sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install vlc
2005-09-06T12:37:00.000Z	puneypunk	thoreauputic	I have the repositories but apt-get install vlc doesn't work?
2005-09-06T12:38:00.000Z	thoreauputic	puneypunk	what does  apt-cache show vlc return? ( don't paste it ! *grin*)
2005-09-06T12:39:00.000Z	puneypunk	thoreauputic	sorry how'd you use apt-cache :s?
2005-09-06T12:40:00.000Z	thoreauputic	puneypunk	 apt-cache show vlc

2005-09-06T12:41:00.000Z	thoreauputic	puneypunk	well, sudo apt-get install vlc should work then, unless your sources are broken
