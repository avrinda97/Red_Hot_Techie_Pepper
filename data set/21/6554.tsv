2007-05-01T07:24:00.000Z	merike		someone to help with network conf?
2007-05-01T07:25:00.000Z	merike		I used edgy's alternate installer and autoconf failed for me, I now need to configure manually
2007-05-01T07:26:00.000Z	salty	merike	are you using wireless?
2007-05-01T07:26:00.000Z	merike		I actually did once and went back to edgy
2007-05-01T07:27:00.000Z	merike		at the moment I'd like to get ethernet working
2007-05-01T07:28:00.000Z	salty	merike	my ethernet worked automatically for me....but i had to configure my wireless
2007-05-01T07:28:00.000Z	merike		I enabled connection, used ifup for eth0, but there's something else I need as well
2007-05-01T07:29:00.000Z	salty	merike	 'ifconfig eth0 up' ?
2007-05-01T07:29:00.000Z	merike		mine did too last time when I used usual installer, however this time it hung
2007-05-01T07:30:00.000Z	merike	salty	did that
2007-05-01T07:30:00.000Z	salty	merike	 are your restricted-modules installed
2007-05-01T07:30:00.000Z	merike	salty	need to check
2007-05-01T07:30:00.000Z	salty		ok
2007-05-01T07:33:00.000Z	merike	salty	seems that they are not, but wouldn't I need them for wireless not ethernet?
2007-05-01T07:34:00.000Z	salty	merike	with my Intel based system...i had problems with eth0 as well...you might also want to make sure dhcp got installed...beyond that i can't help
2007-05-01T07:35:00.000Z	salty		ok thnx Geist_
2007-05-01T07:36:00.000Z	merike	salty	which dhcp entries would I need?
2007-05-01T07:38:00.000Z	salty	merike	i just apt-get install dhcp and it worked for me
2007-05-01T07:39:00.000Z	merike	salty	but if you open synaptic, how many you have?
2007-05-01T07:39:00.000Z	merike	salty	I've got 2, dhcp3-client and dhcp3-common
2007-05-01T07:40:00.000Z	salty	merike	 dhcp3-client is what i have installed
