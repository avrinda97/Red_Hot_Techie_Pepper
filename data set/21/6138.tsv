2007-12-20T11:55:00.000Z	Dark		Can someone please help me with my network issue?
2007-12-20T11:56:00.000Z	Dark		cool
2007-12-20T11:56:00.000Z	_nix_	Dark	try asking
2007-12-20T11:56:00.000Z	_nix_	Dark	is that ur first linux install?
2007-12-20T11:57:00.000Z	_nix_	Dark	oh.. k how do connect to the internet? router in between?
2007-12-20T11:59:00.000Z	_nix_	Dark	mind using the terminal for a while?? enter "ifconfig" to check out if you network card.. the thing your router connects with has been assigned an IP address
2007-12-20T12:01:00.000Z	_nix_	Dark	you'd have to assign an IP address to the card your router is connected with
2007-12-20T12:02:00.000Z	_nix_	Dark	you can try entering "sudo dhclient" for autoconfiguration
2007-12-20T12:04:00.000Z	_nix_	Dark	do you remember what IP address you used to get in the previous installations
2007-12-20T12:07:00.000Z	_nix_	Dark	oh.. k. typically, the case is like this: you->router->internet where the router handles the internet part while allowing for sharing of the connection through different interfaces.. the internal LAN interfaces.
2007-12-20T12:08:00.000Z	_nix_	Dark	cool.. what did you have to do to connect from the XP box?
2007-12-20T12:09:00.000Z	_nix_	Dark	right there.. maybe the dhcp autoconfig is b0rked in this new release.. you might as well go manuall for that one
2007-12-20T12:10:00.000Z	_nix_	Dark	:-)
2007-12-20T12:11:00.000Z	_nix_	Dark	oh.. you're invited to investigate upon that here.. welcome aboard
2007-12-20T12:12:00.000Z	_nix_	Dark	not quite a possibility... dhcp was designed to work out of the box.
2007-12-20T12:13:00.000Z	_nix_	Dark	regardless of any or all interfaces the broadcast came from..
2007-12-20T12:15:00.000Z	_nix_	Dark	you may want to check out the man pages for ifconfig and route if you can get it..
2007-12-20T12:16:00.000Z	_nix_	Dark	a quick pill would be like: sudo ifconfig eth0 <internal-ip> up netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast <router-ip.last octec to 255> && sudo route add default gw <router-ip>
2007-12-20T12:17:00.000Z	_nix_	Dark	and lastly editing the file /etc/resolv.conf for a nameserver.. usually the router's ip goes there as well
2007-12-20T12:18:00.000Z	_nix_	Dark	glad if that helps.. :-)
