2012-10-13T13:53:00.000Z	aatj		if my GUI won't start ctrl + alt + F1 should change to new x-window, right?
2012-10-13T13:54:00.000Z	TJ-	aatj	No. Alt + Ctl + F1 when the X server is running and you're on its TTY will switch you to a console framebuffer TTY
2012-10-13T13:55:00.000Z	TJ-	aatj	Once on a console you only need Alt + F2 through Alt+F6 to switch between the other consoles, or Alt + F7 to get back to the X server
2012-10-13T14:02:00.000Z	TJ-	aatj	When the PC starts, get into the GRUB boot loader menu by holding down Shift, then choose to edit the Recovery option, and add to the kernel's command-line "nomodeset" - that'll get you to a *single user* environment that you can use to get to a root shell console. Note this is single-user - there is only one text console!
2012-10-13T14:08:00.000Z	aatj	TJ-	i restarted my computer i held shift down but nothing happended when grub loaded
2012-10-13T14:08:00.000Z	TJ-	aatj	Did you see the GRUB boot menu with the list of operating systems?
2012-10-13T14:10:00.000Z	TJ-	aatj	OK, so at that menu you move the cursor to the Recovery entry, then press "E" to edit that entry. That takes you to a small text-editor style screen where you can move around with cursors and edit the text. So, move the cursor to the line starting "linux" and move the cursor to the end of it and add the text " nomodeset" . You can then boot with that modified command-line by pressing Ctrl+X
2012-10-13T14:15:00.000Z	aatj	TJ-	ok there is linux /boot/vmlinuz-3.2.0-32-generic ... ... ro recovery nomodest line in this 'text editor style window'
2012-10-13T14:17:00.000Z	TJ-	aatj	That looks correct then - it already has "nomodeset" ... go ahead and boot with that using Ctrl+X ... that should take you to the recovery text-menu, scrolling down on that should offer the option for a root shell (and you can prior to that enable networking from the menu, too).
2012-10-13T14:18:00.000Z	aatj	TJ-	ok, ctrl+x and it went to recovery mode window
2012-10-13T14:21:00.000Z	TJ-	aatj	That will get you a root shell (no need for "sudo"), but it is single-user so there's only TTY1 console. To return to the recovery menu after doing whatever you need, you can type "exit" or press Ctrl+D to return to the recovery menu, and from there choose the "continue to boot normally" option to get to multi-user mode. Then, to start the GUI from there (after logging in) you do "sudo service lightdm start"
2012-10-13T14:24:00.000Z	aatj	TJ-	sorry but how that will get me to root shell? which option should i choose?
2012-10-13T14:25:00.000Z	TJ-	aatj	You might want to choose the "netroot" option so you'll have network access
2012-10-13T14:28:00.000Z	aatj	TJ-	this is the window i see http://www.hecticgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/recovery-mode-options-in-Ubuntu-12.04.jpg
2012-10-13T14:29:00.000Z	TJ-	aatj	Which release of Ubuntu is that? 10.04 ?
2012-10-13T14:29:00.000Z	TJ-	aatj	Choose "network" then choose "root"
2012-10-13T14:36:00.000Z	aatj	TJ-	+ all, thank you, GUI is working again :)
2012-10-13T14:36:00.000Z	TJ-	aatj	Congratulations :)
2012-10-13T14:37:00.000Z	TJ-	aatj	Sometimes its best just to forget it ... figuring it out after the event can often be more of a headache than the problem itself was!
2012-10-13T14:38:00.000Z	TJ-	aatj	As someone else said, who know the ATI drivers better than me, you should be using the Ubuntu proprietary driver installation not the stand-alone ATI installer - because the aTI installer doesn't abide by Ubuntu rules for where files go and how they are modified
2012-10-13T14:48:00.000Z	TJ-	aatj	uninstall the one you've currently got, and use the Ubuntu hardware drivers facility (known as 'jockey') to install the driver from the Ubuntu archives
