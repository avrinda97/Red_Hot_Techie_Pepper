2010-03-19T15:07:00.000Z	j2daosh		so I was intending on using putty to create a reverse ssh tunnel to my home ubuntu server, which in theory anyway, would allow me to use my windows system to rdp into my work computer
2010-03-19T15:07:00.000Z	danopia	j2daosh	that's a pretty strange setup
2010-03-19T15:07:00.000Z	danopia	j2daosh	it would work, yes, but ssh will make it slow
2010-03-19T15:08:00.000Z	j2daosh	danopia	speed isn't really a concern to me. I would be working from home and moving at a slower pace anyway... more coffee breaks :)
2010-03-19T15:09:00.000Z	danopia	j2daosh	when i set up a tunnel to SSH into a server and connect to the SOCKS proxy over ssh, i do: ssh desktop -L 1080:localhost:1080
2010-03-19T15:10:00.000Z	danopia	j2daosh	in putty, config a "remote" tunnel or w/e they call it
2010-03-19T15:11:00.000Z	j2daosh	danopia	yeah, i have all the docs on using putty to set it up, I was just wondering if it was going to be possible to get the remote (work) system to connect to my local server (ubuntu) and use my local (windows) system to rdp back thru the ubuntu server into the windows system
2010-03-19T15:12:00.000Z	danopia	j2daosh	once you have putty connected with the remote "forward", on the remote system sshd shuold be listening on the RDP port
2010-03-19T15:12:00.000Z	danopia	j2daosh	here's a good description, but it's going the other way for you: http://souptonuts.sourceforge.net/sshtips.htm
2010-03-19T15:15:00.000Z	danopia	j2daosh	as long as you can connect to the ssh server now, adding a forward to it should not be an issue
2010-03-19T15:15:00.000Z	danopia	j2daosh	i use forwarding at school because the only unfiltered port is 443 (they can't proxy ssl) so i have my server listen on 443 for ssh, and i connect to that with port 1080 forwarding
2010-03-19T15:15:00.000Z	danopia	j2daosh	then i tell GNOME to connect to localhost:1080 for a SOCKS
2010-03-19T15:17:00.000Z	danopia	j2daosh	right, and by default sshd will only bind to localhost:rdp
2010-03-19T15:18:00.000Z	danopia	j2daosh	you need to reconfig sshd to let remote forwards bind to 0.0.0.0:rdp
2010-03-19T15:18:00.000Z	j2daosh	danopia	and where in the sshd_config is that?
2010-03-19T15:18:00.000Z	danopia	j2daosh	so you can only use the forward from that sshd server by default. i know this from when i used remote forwards to host a webcam image server from an airport via my VPS
2010-03-19T15:19:00.000Z	danopia	j2daosh	i have to leave for school in five minutes, but i have enough time to look, hold on
2010-03-19T15:19:00.000Z	danopia	j2daosh	i have this as the last line: GateWayPorts clientspecified
2010-03-19T15:20:00.000Z	danopia	j2daosh	you still need to ask PuTTY to bind to 0.0.0.0 remotely, it's in the settings somewhere and mentions (may not work) because of the default config
2010-03-19T15:21:00.000Z	danopia	j2daosh	good luck, i'm leaving now
2010-03-19T15:21:00.000Z	danopia	j2daosh	you can memoserv me if you want, or google it
