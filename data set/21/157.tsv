2012-08-29T13:11:00.000Z	zorgborg		hi ubuntu keeps finding internal errors, first it was with apt-get, then something to do with perl, then that seemed to fix itself, firefox is consistently crashing, (even after update today) and now theres another apt problem, you think theres a deeper problem going on?
2012-08-29T13:12:00.000Z	schnuffle	zorgborg	does firefox crash straight away or only when you open a flash page?
2012-08-29T13:13:00.000Z	zorgborg	schnuffle	typically straight away
2012-08-29T13:14:00.000Z	schnuffle	zorgborg	and what gives you a sudo apt-get upgrade in a terminal?
2012-08-29T13:14:00.000Z	schnuffle	zorgborg	did you add any extra repositories?
2012-08-29T13:15:00.000Z	zorgborg	schnuffle	theres an indicator applet on the top panel saying an error occurred when searching for updates, ill just try sudo
2012-08-29T13:16:00.000Z	zorgborg	schnuffle	nope, chrome is having trouble displaying webpages now though
2012-08-29T13:17:00.000Z	zorgborg	schnuffle	it just stalls like last time in the terminal, ceases to do anything
2012-08-29T13:17:00.000Z	zorgborg	schnuffle	ive run rkhunter and everything seems okay, chkrootkit too, but it seems like alot of things are breaking at once
2012-08-29T13:18:00.000Z	schnuffle	zorgborg	can it be that your HDD is braking?
2012-08-29T13:19:00.000Z	schnuffle		breaking
2012-08-29T13:19:00.000Z	zorgborg	schnuffle	actually yes, seems though im having hang at boot issues, ive had to do several hard shutdowns
2012-08-29T13:19:00.000Z	zorgborg		and its a second HDD, couldve handled it rough
2012-08-29T13:22:00.000Z	schnuffle	zorgborg	then hurry up, start from a live system a save your important data, then do a hdd check
2012-08-29T13:23:00.000Z	zorgborg	schnuffle	no idea how to a hdd check, btw im using gnome-panel not unity, i guess thats not gonna have anything to do with apt though
2012-08-29T13:24:00.000Z	schnuffle	zorgborg	create a USB stick with a live system, boot from it and then you can check the HDD with e2fsck
2012-08-29T13:25:00.000Z	zorgborg	schnuffle	ah right thanks :), will do, presume i can pop the live system on a CD tho if USB doesnt work?
2012-08-29T13:27:00.000Z	schnuffle		Yes
2012-08-29T13:27:00.000Z	schnuffle	zorgborg	USB is just more convenient an uses less resources :)
2012-08-29T13:29:00.000Z	zorgborg	schnuffle	is e2fsck a CLI tool?
2012-08-29T13:30:00.000Z	schnuffle	zorgborg	Yes
