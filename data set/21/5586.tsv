2007-10-08T09:11:00.000Z	sipher		heh sorry
2007-10-08T09:12:00.000Z	sipher		;)
2007-10-08T09:13:00.000Z	sipher		it looks like a binary file...
2007-10-08T09:14:00.000Z	heguru	sipher	just open the file packagename.prerm
2007-10-08T09:06:00.000Z	heguru	sipher	what software are you trying to remove? if you cannot solve the removal script problem using the normal ways, you can edit the removal script manually and comment out the parts that are failing
2007-10-08T09:06:00.000Z	heguru	sipher	that should be the last resort though
2007-10-08T09:07:00.000Z	sipher	heguru	i just did the update to gusty
2007-10-08T09:07:00.000Z	heguru	sipher	and what package is giving this error?
2007-10-08T09:07:00.000Z	heguru	sipher	ok
2007-10-08T09:08:00.000Z	heguru	sipher	I assume you have tried all the possible ways to remove it using dpk/apt-get?
2007-10-08T09:10:00.000Z	sipher	heguru	?
2007-10-08T09:10:00.000Z	heguru	sipher	yes one minute
2007-10-08T09:11:00.000Z	heguru	sipher	i am trying to remember where are the remove scripts places (anyone else remembers? dpkg remove scripts?)
2007-10-08T09:11:00.000Z	heguru	sipher	thanks nickrud, you have to go to /var/lib/dpkg/info
2007-10-08T09:13:00.000Z	heguru	sipher	the package name again?
2007-10-08T09:14:00.000Z	heguru	sipher	or package.postrm
2007-10-08T09:14:00.000Z	heguru	sipher	it should be a script
2007-10-08T09:14:00.000Z	heguru	sipher	well then just mv it to .bak
2007-10-08T09:14:00.000Z	heguru	sipher	and touch compiz-gtk.postrm
2007-10-08T09:18:00.000Z	heguru	sipher	did it work? you have to know that this is a dirty hack
2007-10-08T09:19:00.000Z	heguru	sipher	:) I usually recommend a reinstall and remove cycle for the same app after such things
