2010-10-14T04:01:00.000Z	Spofer		[ubuntu newbie] I'm having problems with apt-get - I can't install basically anything. Where can i find documentation about the apt-get tool (I don't have man and can't install it)
2010-10-14T04:02:00.000Z	jsec	Spofer	what's the issue?
2010-10-14T04:02:00.000Z	Spofer	jsec	I'm getting "dpkg: error processing tzdata (--configure)" on everything
2010-10-14T04:04:00.000Z	jsec	Spofer	what happens if you try re-installing tzdata?
2010-10-14T04:05:00.000Z	Spofer	jsec	Actually the problem started with man-db (--configure), and reinstalling it made it uninstalled....
2010-10-14T04:05:00.000Z	Spofer	jsec	but i'll try, just a sec
2010-10-14T04:08:00.000Z	Spofer	jsec	Apparently you  can't remove tzdata. It's uninstalls almost every package on ubuntu
2010-10-14T04:09:00.000Z	jsec	Spofer	right, there's a ton of packages that are dependent on it. Hang on...
2010-10-14T04:10:00.000Z	Spofer	jsec	Isn't is cool that you need to type in "Yes, do as I say!"?
2010-10-14T04:10:00.000Z	jsec	Spofer	huh?
2010-10-14T04:11:00.000Z	Spofer	jsec	When you apt-get remove tzdata you need to confirm by typing in "Yes, do as I say!"
2010-10-14T04:14:00.000Z	jsec	Spofer	sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
2010-10-14T04:14:00.000Z	Spofer	jsec	trying, thanks
2010-10-14T04:14:00.000Z	Spofer	jsec	tzdata is broken or not fully installed
2010-10-14T04:15:00.000Z	jsec	Spofer	k that's what I thought. One second.
2010-10-14T04:28:00.000Z	jsec	Spofer	do you have an nvidia card?
2010-10-14T04:33:00.000Z	jsec	Spofer	ok, so there's no harm in trying this then. apt-get purge nvidia-common, then apt-get install nvidia-comon
2010-10-14T04:34:00.000Z	Spofer	jsec	ok, trying
2010-10-14T04:35:00.000Z	Spofer	jsec	the purge returned an error: Setting up tzdata (2010m-0ubuntu0.10.04) ...
2010-10-14T04:35:00.000Z	jsec	Spofer	:(
2010-10-14T04:35:00.000Z	Spofer	jsec	tell me about it :)
