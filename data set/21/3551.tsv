2009-04-22T15:47:00.000Z	bassliner	wgrant	ok it's a hardy there
2009-04-22T15:42:00.000Z	wgrant	bassliner	It only exists on i386, not amd64. It also shouldn't be necessary any more.
2009-04-22T15:42:00.000Z	bassliner	wgrant	i got 2 i686 machines here
2009-04-22T15:43:00.000Z	wgrant	bassliner	Same version of of Ubuntu?
2009-04-22T15:43:00.000Z	bassliner	wgrant	and both have ubuntu 8.10
2009-04-22T15:43:00.000Z	bassliner	wgrant	yeah
2009-04-22T15:44:00.000Z	wgrant	bassliner	'apt-cache policy flashplugin-nonfree-extrasound' on both, please.
2009-04-22T15:46:00.000Z	bassliner	wgrant	one second :)
2009-04-22T15:46:00.000Z	bassliner	wgrant	it's my girlfriend's computer and i have to remotely get her to enter stuff in the terminal :)
2009-04-22T15:47:00.000Z	bassliner	wgrant	which she obviously does real good but remember it's just my girlfriend
2009-04-22T15:47:00.000Z	wgrant	bassliner	Sure.
2009-04-22T15:48:00.000Z	bassliner	wgrant	nevermind, thanks in advance :)
2009-04-22T15:48:00.000Z	wgrant	bassliner	That would do it.
2009-04-22T15:53:00.000Z	bassliner	wgrant	is that problem still existing with 9.04?
2009-04-22T15:54:00.000Z	bassliner	wgrant	or will it just be smooth sail and it works out-of-the-box?
2009-04-22T15:54:00.000Z	bassliner	wgrant	she obviously just got an 8.04 LTS there
2009-04-22T15:54:00.000Z	bassliner	wgrant	i'm probably just going to install her a 9.04 tomorrow
2009-04-22T15:56:00.000Z	wgrant	bassliner	It's no longer needed in 9.04, nor 8.10 in most cases.
2009-04-22T15:57:00.000Z	bassliner	wgrant	well i had to install that extrasound package on my netbook running 8.10, hence the question :)
2009-04-22T15:57:00.000Z	wgrant	bassliner	Right, butÂ it's certainly not needed in Jaunty.
2009-04-22T15:57:00.000Z	bassliner	wgrant	thanks!
