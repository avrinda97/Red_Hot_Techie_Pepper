2006-06-10T12:35:00.000Z	made		hello all.. I'm in the process of installing the latest nvidia drivers via method 2 because everytime I try to install the drivers via the package manager I always get a X error
2006-06-10T12:36:00.000Z	made		can somebody help me figure out what I put when terminal asks for "--kernel-source-path=/usr/"
2006-06-10T12:38:00.000Z	made		can somebody help me with installation of the nvidia drivers?
2006-06-10T12:38:00.000Z	made		read what I said above.. I have already been there and read that
2006-06-10T12:39:00.000Z	made		can somebody help me figure out what I put when terminal asks for "--kernel-source-path=/usr/"
2006-06-10T12:39:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	made	you need to have build-essential and your kernel sources installed
2006-06-10T12:40:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	made	1 sec
2006-06-10T12:41:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	made	'sudo apt-get install linux-source'
2006-06-10T12:44:00.000Z	made	pppoe_dude	I have linux-source now..
2006-06-10T12:45:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	made	it should be somewhere in /usr/src
2006-06-10T12:46:00.000Z	made	pppoe_dude	linux-source-2.6.15.tar.bz2 is the only significant file I see
2006-06-10T12:47:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	made	you need to unpack that file
2006-06-10T12:47:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	made	bzip2 -d <file> then tar -xvf <file>
2006-06-10T12:47:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	made	this method is not the most clean
2006-06-10T12:47:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	made	is this for nvidia?
2006-06-10T12:48:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	made	you can keep going if you want
2006-06-10T12:49:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	made	compiling your own packages like that (using kernel sources etc.) might upset dpkg
2006-06-10T12:50:00.000Z	made	pppoe_dude	I'll try the wiki again but this will be my 3rd install of Ubuntu 6.06.. I had no problem installing Nvidia via this method in 5.10
2006-06-10T12:51:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	made	i c, would it be the 3rd because of nvidia drivers?
2006-06-10T12:51:00.000Z	made	pppoe_dude	yes
2006-06-10T13:24:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	made	np
