2007-12-19T16:25:00.000Z	staykovmarin		i am running testdisk, and it finds the damaged fat32 partition (it doesnt let me view any of the files, it says its damaged)
2007-12-19T16:25:00.000Z	staykovmarin		what is the best way to go about fixing it
2007-12-19T16:27:00.000Z	Slart	staykovmarin	just out of curiosity.. did you install testdisk from the 7.04 live cd? or the package dvd?
2007-12-19T16:28:00.000Z	staykovmarin	Slart	i downloaded, and transfered it using my mp3 player
2007-12-19T16:28:00.000Z	Slart	staykovmarin	ok, thanks
2007-12-19T16:30:00.000Z	Slart	staykovmarin	there seems to some info here http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk
2007-12-19T16:31:00.000Z	Slart	staykovmarin	they even have recovery examples on that wiki
2007-12-19T16:33:00.000Z	staykovmarin	Slart	yeah i am looking at it, i just dont really know which one is my problem even
2007-12-19T16:33:00.000Z	Slart	staykovmarin	you upgraded and the partition is gone, right?
2007-12-19T16:34:00.000Z	staykovmarin	Slart	yes
2007-12-19T16:34:00.000Z	staykovmarin	Slart	i see a fat32 partition in there, and i cant list the files, it says partition damaged
2007-12-19T16:35:00.000Z	Slart	staykovmarin	resized? you chose this during the upgrade? or it did it by itself?
2007-12-19T16:36:00.000Z	staykovmarin	Slart	i chose it during upgrade, 200 gigs to my new partition and the other information to be resized to the other 200 gigs of the drive
2007-12-19T16:38:00.000Z	Slart	staykovmarin	ah.. so you did a new install.. not an upgrade.. and created a new partition by moving the existing partitions towards the end of the drive.. and this somehow killed one of the partitions?
2007-12-19T16:38:00.000Z	Slart	staykovmarin	strange.. I've always thought the ubuntu installer was pretty good with these things.. never had it mess up like this.
2007-12-19T16:39:00.000Z	Slart	staykovmarin	ok.. were you able to run testdisk? did it create a log? could you pastebin the log?
2007-12-19T16:41:00.000Z	staykovmarin	Slart	where is the log stored?
2007-12-19T16:47:00.000Z	staykovmarin	Slart	http://www.pastebin.org/12131
2007-12-19T16:53:00.000Z	Slart	staykovmarin	did you try listing the files in the found fat32 partition using testdisk?
2007-12-19T16:53:00.000Z	Slart	staykovmarin	it didn't offer any other options after that?
2007-12-19T16:55:00.000Z	Slart	staykovmarin	well.. I don't think I can do you any good.. I don't see any obvious solutions.. is the data lost valuable enough to send the drive to one of those data-rescue-companies?
