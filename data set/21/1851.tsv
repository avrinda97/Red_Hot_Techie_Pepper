2010-06-06T02:55:00.000Z	deusr		hello?
2010-06-06T02:56:00.000Z	deusr		Does anyone know compile driver here?
2010-06-06T02:56:00.000Z	deusr		?
2010-06-06T02:56:00.000Z	lucid_lynx	deusr	isn't it just like compiling any other program?
2010-06-06T02:57:00.000Z	deusr	lucid_lynx	webcam ->>> http://pastebin.com/UjsbanHd
2010-06-06T02:58:00.000Z	deusr	lucid_lynx	my webcam the use driver pac7302 and ubuntu only got 7311
2010-06-06T03:00:00.000Z	deusr	lucid_lynx	my webcam driver uses the 7302 and ubuntu has only 7311
2010-06-06T03:00:00.000Z	lucid_lynx	deusr	it seems like you're missing some C header files required to compile the drivers
2010-06-06T03:02:00.000Z	deusr	lucid_lynx	I downloaded the driver with the command... hg clone http://linuxtv.org/hg/v4l-dvb
2010-06-06T03:02:00.000Z	lucid_lynx	deusr	are you sure you're compiling the right drivers? because that seems to be drivers for TV tuner cards, not webcam drivers
2010-06-06T03:03:00.000Z	lucid_lynx		is it possible to remap mouse buttons to keyboard shortcuts, like with the btnx program, on a program-to-program basis?
2010-06-06T03:03:00.000Z	deusr	lucid_lynx	the driver is here.. http://linuxtv.org/hg/v4l-dvb
2010-06-06T03:04:00.000Z	lucid_lynx	deusr	I know, but it everything points to it being DVB (TV tuner) drivers, not webcam drivers
2010-06-06T03:07:00.000Z	deusr	lucid_lynx	search for 093a:2620 in http://moinejf.free.fr/webcam.html
2010-06-06T03:10:00.000Z	lucid_lynx	deusr	could you please put than link in a context?
2010-06-06T03:11:00.000Z	deusr	lucid_lynx	pac7302 093a:2620 Apollo model AC-905x pac7302  OK
2010-06-06T03:12:00.000Z	lucid_lynx	deusr	no, why is that site so interesting? what is "OK" with the "Apollo model AC-905x"?
2010-06-06T03:13:00.000Z	lucid_lynx	deusr	anyway, look at this forum thread with instructions for v4l-dvb drivers in Ubuntu: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1305228
2010-06-06T03:14:00.000Z	deusr	lucid_lynx	if you access the link and look for what I sent, you will see that there is a driver for my webcam and it works (OK). in short, I need to just compile and upload the module
2010-06-06T03:15:00.000Z	lucid_lynx	deusr	well, where the heck does it stand that you need the v4l-dvb drivers? also, see the link I sent you
2010-06-06T03:16:00.000Z	deusr	lucid_lynx	ok
