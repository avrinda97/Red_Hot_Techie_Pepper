2009-11-03T07:43:00.000Z	darlek		how many times does firefox crash in a day now?  I upgraded to 9.10 .  Not happy
2009-11-03T07:44:00.000Z	darlek		Don't know.  I checked launchpad and they suggested removing plugins and trying again.  Still, I get crashes a lot more often now compared to yesterday
2009-11-03T07:44:00.000Z	darlek		I took out firebug and others.  Left in a couple, but I might have to use epiphany for a while if I want to get anything done
2009-11-03T07:45:00.000Z	PingFloyd	darlek	I'd try uninstalling all extensions
2009-11-03T07:45:00.000Z	PingFloyd	darlek	see what happens
2009-11-03T07:46:00.000Z	darlek	PingFloyd	tried that, it works, then I load noscript and adblock, it works, but it still crashed 10 times a day so far.  Really disappointing
2009-11-03T07:46:00.000Z	PingFloyd	darlek	I run noscript, never have any crashes, maybe adblock is causing troubles
2009-11-03T07:47:00.000Z	PingFloyd	darlek	also try renaming your ~/.mozilla dir and running
2009-11-03T07:48:00.000Z	darlek	PingFloyd	well, fwiw it seems to just crash on any media playing or state change, like gmail or https as well.  Both plugins work fine, long term not so much
2009-11-03T07:48:00.000Z	PingFloyd	darlek	to rule out whether there is a setting causing havok
2009-11-03T07:48:00.000Z	darlek	PingFloyd	yes, I used a new profile, firefox -ProfileManager and that worked okay
2009-11-03T07:49:00.000Z	darlek	PingFloyd	I guess I'll use only 1 plugin, but that blows
2009-11-03T07:49:00.000Z	PingFloyd	darlek	if it works ok when you change profile, that means there's some setting messing things up
2009-11-03T07:50:00.000Z	darlek	PingFloyd	yes
2009-11-03T07:50:00.000Z	PingFloyd	darlek	look about:config and revert user set settings back to default
2009-11-03T07:50:00.000Z	PingFloyd	darlek	you may want to copy the profile first
2009-11-03T07:50:00.000Z	PingFloyd	darlek	so you can always revert back
2009-11-03T07:51:00.000Z	darlek	PingFloyd	profilemanager helps for that, it runs just missing all my stuff
2009-11-03T07:51:00.000Z	darlek	PingFloyd	this is where a google bookmarks or some website based bookmark program would help.  But that's a plugin!  argh...
2009-11-03T07:52:00.000Z	darlek	PingFloyd	I'll see how it goes
