2010-04-14T02:48:00.000Z	histo	KamaL	vino is a vnc server
2010-04-14T02:49:00.000Z	histo	KamaL	have you tried using the tight encoding
2010-04-14T02:49:00.000Z	histo	KamaL	speeds things up quite a bit
2010-04-14T02:49:00.000Z	KamaL	histo	u mean tightVNC?
2010-04-14T02:49:00.000Z	histo	KamaL	no I mean tight encoding
2010-04-14T02:50:00.000Z	histo	KamaL	but tightvnc has it
2010-04-14T02:51:00.000Z	histo	KamaL	yeah but your really dont' need a color depth of 24 do you for remote desktop?
2010-04-14T02:51:00.000Z	histo	KamaL	also make sure your windows client is specifying tight encoding
2010-04-14T02:51:00.000Z	KamaL	histo	done
2010-04-14T02:52:00.000Z	histo	KamaL	is it still to slow then?

2010-04-14T02:54:00.000Z	KamaL	histo	what's a good color depth?
2010-04-14T02:54:00.000Z	histo	KamaL	sure.
2010-04-14T02:55:00.000Z	histo	KamaL	you can also try freenx everything is free so there's really no trouble from tryign different ones
2010-04-14T02:56:00.000Z	KamaL	histo	any advantage over tightvnc?
