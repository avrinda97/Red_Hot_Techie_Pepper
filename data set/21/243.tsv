2012-05-04T05:41:00.000Z	wylde	conkyhelp	are you enabling show hidden files?
2012-05-04T05:41:00.000Z	conkyhelp	wylde	ls -al, yes
2012-05-04T05:42:00.000Z	wylde	conkyhelp	alrighty, just checking :)
2012-05-04T05:47:00.000Z	wylde	conkyhelp	http://conky.sourceforge.net/docs.html  did you check for .conkyrc in /etc/conky/.conkyrc  ?
2012-05-04T05:47:00.000Z	conkyhelp	wylde	yes, its not there either. only conky.conf
2012-05-04T05:47:00.000Z	wylde	conkyhelp	 hmmm ok.
2012-05-04T05:48:00.000Z	wylde	conkyhelp	ok, could try 'locate conkyrc' I suppose
2012-05-04T05:49:00.000Z	conkyhelp	wylde	file not found
2012-05-04T05:51:00.000Z	wylde	conkyhelp	 ... or maybe I could actually read the link I posted to you lol. /etc/conky/conky.conf is the sample configuration, 'cp /etc/conky/conky.conf /home/$USER/.conkyrc
2012-05-04T05:52:00.000Z	conkyhelp	wylde	im trying to get this running using my install of conky http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/conkytransmission?content=129001
2012-05-04T05:54:00.000Z	wylde	conkyhelp	line 1 in the instructions. Do you have conky installed?
2012-05-04T05:55:00.000Z	conkyhelp	wylde	obviously..., its installed, i can run it, but there is no .conkyrc so the install script will not allow me to customize it. i try to create an artificial / fake one, and no effect
2012-05-04T05:56:00.000Z	wylde	conkyhelp	alright, then I should assume you installed transmission-cli and edited the preferences there.... according to the instructions, install.sh should create the sample .conkyrc for you, so it isn't then?
2012-05-04T05:57:00.000Z	conkyhelp	wylde	yes, exactly. this is the problem
2012-05-04T05:59:00.000Z	wylde	conkyhelp	then you should be seeking help from the author of that package.
2012-05-04T06:03:00.000Z	wylde	conkyhelp	see if 'cp ~/.conkytransmission/example.conkyrc ~/.conkyrc' creates it, that's all the install script does if you don't have one anyway.
2012-05-04T06:08:00.000Z	conkyhelp	wylde	bloody hell, it created it, but it broke conky lol!
2012-05-04T06:08:00.000Z	wylde	conkyhelp	figures >.<
2012-05-04T06:09:00.000Z	conkyhelp	wylde	thanks for your help, ill fiddle with the script to see if i can fix the conkyrc file
2012-05-04T06:09:00.000Z	wylde	conkyhelp	np
