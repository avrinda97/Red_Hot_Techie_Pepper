2008-05-05T18:02:00.000Z	noob-africa_	bazhang	i cannot access File -> Change Device menu nor the volume control ... since i upgraded to 8.04... any ideas?
2008-05-15T13:24:00.000Z	noob-africa_	bazhang	i have a usb-flash disk (NTFS) that i have mounted, but all its files are locked, and i need to delete some .exe files which are viruses
2008-05-15T13:24:00.000Z	bazhang	noob-africa_	why not run them through clamav
2008-05-15T13:25:00.000Z	noob-africa_	bazhang	well, it seems 8.04 hasnt yet supported some NTFS drives... clamav works on 8.04?
2008-05-15T13:25:00.000Z	bazhang	noob-africa_	sure it does
2008-05-15T13:26:00.000Z	noob-africa_	bazhang	automatically? well, it DID mount the flash, but i dont have read/write access
2008-05-15T13:26:00.000Z	noob-africa_	bazhang	check out my pastebin http://pastebin.ca/1018804
2008-05-15T13:30:00.000Z	noob-africa_	bazhang	i followed instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MountingWindowsPartitions but they didnt work
2008-05-15T13:30:00.000Z	bazhang	noob-africa_	I'd suggest going with clamav then
2008-05-15T13:31:00.000Z	noob-africa_	bazhang	clamav will clean the viruses even with my current access rights?
2008-05-15T13:31:00.000Z	bazhang	noob-africa_	not sure about that? why not copy over the good files and then format
2008-05-15T19:35:00.000Z	noob-africa_	bazhang	hi... do u know why VLC doesnt support SVCD media on 9.04? and how do i make it recognise my SVCD disc?
2008-05-15T19:37:00.000Z	bazhang	noob-africa_	not sure; should work-->you tried playing it on dvd player yet
2008-05-15T19:38:00.000Z	noob-africa_	bazhang	dont have any dvds here with me... i sent my demos to the broadcasting corp. am gonna be working with, starting monday... lolz
2008-05-15T19:39:00.000Z	noob-africa_	bazhang	i even tried the SVCD discs on my iMac... didnt play... they only play on a commercial home theatre system
2008-05-15T19:39:00.000Z	bazhang	noob-africa_	sounds like they have some weird anti-computer drm on them then
2008-05-15T19:40:00.000Z	noob-africa_	bazhang	what's drm?
2008-05-15T19:40:00.000Z	bazhang	noob-africa_	digital restriction s management
2008-05-15T19:40:00.000Z	noob-africa_	bazhang	ah...
2008-05-15T19:41:00.000Z	noob-africa_	bazhang	but the SVCD is my own... i created it using Adobe Premiere Pro 1.5 (Windows) way back in 2006!
2008-05-15T19:41:00.000Z	bazhang	noob-africa_	really no idea apart from asking you to try some different players
