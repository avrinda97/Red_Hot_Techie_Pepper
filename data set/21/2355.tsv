2009-11-02T05:24:00.000Z	doc-saintly		I just upgraded to karmic koala and all my video is the wrong color. It seems i's missing yellow?
2009-11-02T05:24:00.000Z	doc-saintly		Things that used to be yellow are now blue, and things that were blue are now read
2009-11-02T05:24:00.000Z	kjele	doc-saintly	Are you using Totem?
2009-11-02T05:24:00.000Z	doc-saintly	kjele	no, vlc
2009-11-02T05:24:00.000Z	kjele	doc-saintly	Could you open totem?
2009-11-02T05:25:00.000Z	doc-saintly	kjele	i don't have totem it looks like
2009-11-02T05:25:00.000Z	kjele	doc-saintly	Did you remove it?
2009-11-02T05:25:00.000Z	doc-saintly	kjele	er no. i just don't see anything called totem. is it "movie player"?
2009-11-02T05:26:00.000Z	kjele	doc-saintly	yes
2009-11-02T05:26:00.000Z	kjele	doc-saintly	go to preference

2009-11-02T05:27:00.000Z	kjele	doc-saintly	Then display
2009-11-02T05:27:00.000Z	kjele	doc-saintly	Then press on the reset to Default
2009-11-02T05:27:00.000Z	doc-saintly	kjele	ah crazy. that did it, why would it have done that?
2009-11-02T05:27:00.000Z	kjele	doc-saintly	All cursor should be in the middle
2009-11-02T05:27:00.000Z	doc-saintly	kjele	are the title bars dark brown in karmic as default though?
2009-11-02T05:28:00.000Z	kjele	doc-saintly	An old sanity bug in gstreamer
2009-11-02T05:28:00.000Z	kjele	doc-saintly	Something wrong with the title bar?
2009-11-02T05:28:00.000Z	doc-saintly	kjele	thanks so much for the quick fix though :)
2009-11-02T05:29:00.000Z	kjele	doc-saintly	It is a new theme. Do you like the old one?
2009-11-02T05:31:00.000Z	doc-saintly	kjele	undecided about the new theme, but i was just making sure it wasn't another video bug somewhere else :)
