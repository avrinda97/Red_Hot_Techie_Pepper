2011-09-06T07:19:00.000Z	usr13	hullo	Open a terminal and type   df     #Tell us what it says.
2011-09-06T07:19:00.000Z	usr13	hullo	And then, open a terminal and type   df -     #Tell us what it says.

2011-09-06T07:22:00.000Z	usr13	hullo	 sde1  is root?   Do you have separate /home partition?
2011-09-06T07:23:00.000Z	usr13	hullo	Which line up there is from df   and which is from   df -i  ?  (One says 90%).

2011-09-06T07:34:00.000Z	usr13	hullo	unplug the USB one and plug in the ps2 one and it should just work.
2011-09-06T07:35:00.000Z	usr13	hullo	In other words, just plug it in.
