2006-10-13T07:08:00.000Z	tritium	Samuli^	language!
2006-10-13T07:08:00.000Z	Samuli^	tritium	please. :)
2006-10-13T07:09:00.000Z	Samuli^	tritium	..why?
2006-10-13T07:10:00.000Z	tritium	Samuli^	foul language is inappropriate here, as it's a child/family/work friendly channel.
2006-10-13T07:13:00.000Z	Samuli^	tritium	but s it?
2006-10-13T07:14:00.000Z	tritium	Samuli^	yes, of course.  That's not appropriate in front of children.  We need to set an example, even if they know that word.  Come on, now.
2006-10-13T07:15:00.000Z	Samuli^	tritium	I don't get you, but maybe that's because I'm finnish and not native to english.
2006-10-13T07:15:00.000Z	Samuli^	tritium	here even children know what sh*t or poo means :)
2006-10-13T07:16:00.000Z	tritium	Samuli^	that's not the point.  Please drop it now.
2006-10-13T07:16:00.000Z	Samuli^	tritium	what IS the point?
2006-10-13T07:16:00.000Z	tritium	Samuli^	setting a good example.  Now drop it!
2006-10-13T07:17:00.000Z	Samuli^	tritium	come on, unban the guy who said the S-word. Please? I'm sure he didn't realize it was banned, just like I didn't. And I consider myself a good person.
2006-10-13T07:18:00.000Z	tritium	Samuli^	scroll up and you'll see you're mistaken.  He did realize.
2006-10-13T07:19:00.000Z	Samuli^	tritium	I can't scrollback far enough to see if what you're telling is the truth or not.
2006-10-13T07:19:00.000Z	tritium	Samuli^	I don't lie.  Now, I've asked you to drop the subject.
2006-10-13T07:20:00.000Z	Samuli^	tritium	whatever. What you COULD do as a service people on a service-chan is to address the complaints accordingly.
