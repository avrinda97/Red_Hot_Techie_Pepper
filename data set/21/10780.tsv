2004-11-17T11:03:00.000Z	epod		am I going to seriously regret going from warty to hoary at this point in time, were I to do so?
2004-11-17T11:03:00.000Z	kent	epod	you should regret. There's no point in making your computer unstable.
2004-11-17T11:05:00.000Z	kent	epod	well.. i can burn audio-cds with warty. I did it yesterday with k3b. Although i started it as root from a gnome-terminal
2004-11-17T11:06:00.000Z	epod	kent	Ok, then I will declare the k3b devs to be on crack :)  Can't you just chmod +s the k3b bin? (Insecure,  I know, but hey)
2004-12-06T15:39:00.000Z	kent	epod	it sounds like a bug. I have several programs doing audio at once.
2004-12-06T15:39:00.000Z	epod	kent	Hm, okay.  Just totem, maybe?  Can you try running rythmbox and totem at the same time and let me know if it works for you?
2004-12-06T15:41:00.000Z	kent	epod	i can try. But rhythmbox is kind of slow on my computer, i have a very large archive of music. But wait a second.
2004-12-06T15:42:00.000Z	epod	kent	Thank you :)
2004-12-06T15:43:00.000Z	kent	epod	i can play music in both rhythmbox and totem at the same time.
2004-12-06T15:43:00.000Z	epod	kent	hm.. weird.  The livecd crashed all over me when I tried.  Is there a newer livecd I can d/l?
2004-12-06T15:44:00.000Z	kent	epod	dont know about that the livecd, cant you use partition magic to resize the ntfs?  I dont think there is a free program that does ntfs :(
2004-12-06T15:45:00.000Z	epod	kent	I don't have a copy of that, and finding a store that sold something like that here would be impossible (I live in a small town.  Here, you buy software at Wal-Mart.)
2004-12-06T15:46:00.000Z	kent	epod	 *cough* get it from the internet,  i here its possible to download stuff for free  ;)
2004-12-06T15:47:00.000Z	epod	kent	Ohhh.  lol
2004-12-06T15:52:00.000Z	kent	epod	as for being able to run Ubuntu without problems,  for me i've never had a problem (though i never had any with Fedora either). If you can keep away from running unstable things, i dont see any reason to doubt the stability of Ubuntu.
2004-12-06T15:53:00.000Z	epod	kent	Hmm, okay.  One other thing, are you running totem-gstreamer, or totem-xine?
2004-12-06T15:55:00.000Z	kent	epod	totem-xine and the w32codecs (from universe).
2004-12-06T15:56:00.000Z	epod	kent	Hm, okay.  Then I guess maybe the livecd just has old versions
2004-12-06T15:56:00.000Z	kent	epod	I dont know if totem-gstreamer will use those codecs but i know totem-xine does. I never checked it becaus it was so easy to install totem-xine  :)
2004-12-06T15:56:00.000Z	kent	epod	ubuntu comes with totem-gstreamer in default. I installed totem-xine after the installation.
2004-12-06T15:59:00.000Z	kent	epod	 i might be wrong but i think totem with the gstreamer backend is kind of buggy.
