2008-05-01T18:03:00.000Z	hipitihop		I have a machine on Feisty which fails on all update attempts. I have checked /etc/apt/sources.list and all is valid. Is there somewhere else I need to check ?
2008-05-01T18:04:00.000Z	bazhang	hipitihop	can you try from the terminal and pastebin the errors please
2008-05-01T18:07:00.000Z	hipitihop	bazhang	on sudo apt-get update it just sits there waiting for headers @ 0%
2008-05-01T18:07:00.000Z	bazhang	hipitihop	the servers have caused many complaints over the last day or so-->not a problem on your end
2008-05-01T18:10:00.000Z	hipitihop	bazhang	perhaps, however this is a long standing problem (failed to authenticate when I tried to upgrade to Gutsy) which I have only just decided to try and finally resolve because I want to update to Hardy
2008-05-01T18:10:00.000Z	bazhang	hipitihop	have you tried switching mirrors
2008-05-01T18:11:00.000Z	hipitihop	bazhang	yes, I tend to run apt-cacher on my machines but have tried switching mirrors
2008-05-01T18:13:00.000Z	hipitihop	bazhang	btw, the apt-get update is up to 23% however all headers so far ignored e.g. " Ign http://archive.ubuntu.com feisty-updates Release.gpg "
2008-05-01T18:16:00.000Z	hipitihop	bazhang	is the sources.list the only file referred to or is there something else ?
2008-05-01T18:17:00.000Z	bazhang	hipitihop	there are repos that are almost ignored here when updating (gutsy and hardy both) the sources.list afaik
2008-05-01T18:19:00.000Z	hipitihop	bazhang	is there some log I can check ?
2008-05-01T18:30:00.000Z	hipitihop	bazhang	my apt-get update completed (with errors) see example above to Chapai
2008-05-01T18:35:00.000Z	bazhang	hipitihop	that is unlikley in the extreme
2008-05-01T18:50:00.000Z	hipitihop	bazhang	Chapai: solved it !! I had an apt.conf pointing at an old mirror(apt-cacher server) in /etc/apt/  .. now deleted
2008-05-01T18:50:00.000Z	bazhang	hipitihop	nicely done :]
2008-05-01T18:51:00.000Z	hipitihop	bazhang	Chapai: thanks for trying and your time
2009-11-01T12:39:00.000Z	bazhang	hipitihop	like aptoncd  ?
2009-11-01T12:44:00.000Z	hipitihop	bazhang	aptoncd looks interesting thanks but not a solution for this. I was thinking more like apt-cacher
2009-11-01T12:53:00.000Z	hipitihop	bazhang	_Dasda: in fact apt-cacher doco has something about using it at upgrade time but have not tried it
2010-03-21T12:21:00.000Z	bazhang	hipitihop	he means the kernel
2010-03-21T12:21:00.000Z	hipitihop	bazhang	ok sorry, that will teach me to but in
