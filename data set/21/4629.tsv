2008-04-17T05:45:00.000Z	twistage		Is there usually a lot of trouble with things breaking upon new distro releases?
2008-04-17T05:46:00.000Z	bazhang	twistage	you have a support question or just want to chat
2008-04-17T05:46:00.000Z	twistage	bazhang	Im just curious
2008-05-01T06:42:00.000Z	bazhang	twistage	not in packages.ubuntu.com ?
2008-05-02T20:08:00.000Z	bazhang	twistage	deborphan?
2008-05-02T20:10:00.000Z	twistage	bazhang	Is deborphan generally pretty safe? I've heard stories of it removing packages that people needed
2008-05-02T20:12:00.000Z	bazhang	twistage	safe? this is linux ;]
2008-05-10T09:29:00.000Z	bazhang	twistage	aye
2008-05-10T09:30:00.000Z	twistage	bazhang	How do I play with the settings?
2008-05-10T09:34:00.000Z	twistage	bazhang	Sorry to be so inept, but does it allow per application volume-control.. etc? Because I'm under sound preferences and it looks the exact same as it did in Gutsy. I don't see any added features? Maybe I'm in the wrong place? System>Pref>Sound?
2008-05-10T09:35:00.000Z	bazhang	twistage	let me look hang on a sec
2008-05-10T09:40:00.000Z	twistage	bazhang	Any luck?
2008-05-10T09:41:00.000Z	bazhang	twistage	did that not do it?
2008-05-10T09:41:00.000Z	bazhang	twistage	right click and add to panel
2008-05-10T09:43:00.000Z	twistage	bazhang	I'm confused, did you say something before hand? What am I adding to panel? I have a volume control already. I thought Pulse-audio allowed for per application volume control, etc? Or did I misunderstand?
2008-05-10T09:44:00.000Z	bazhang	twistage	oops wrong nick sorry
2008-05-10T09:45:00.000Z	bazhang	twistage	for a lot of stuff the prefs work; but for individual apps it might be a bug that overrides the setting
2008-05-10T09:46:00.000Z	twistage	bazhang	Pulse audio is new to Hardy though, correct? Shouldn't there be some new settings under my Sound Preferences? Because it looks the same as it did in Gutsy.
2008-05-10T09:47:00.000Z	bazhang	twistage	I set the top to alsa and left the rest alone--you can try to set them on various levels --some bugs to work out as this is still pretty new
2008-05-10T09:47:00.000Z	bazhang	twistage	you should see the launchpad page ;]
2008-05-10T09:48:00.000Z	bazhang	twistage	err pages I mean ;]
