2009-12-10T04:18:00.000Z	ikonia	LetsGo67	it it visually slow, or slow at actually doing things ?

2009-12-10T04:23:00.000Z	ikonia	LetsGo67	what video card is in your machine, the wrong xorg configuration can often give the impression of a machine running slow, but it's not actually running slow
2009-12-10T04:24:00.000Z	LetsGo67	ikonia	it starts up just fine, it eventually slows down.  Doubt it's an xorg issue because I can watch movies and DVDs.
2009-12-10T04:24:00.000Z	ikonia	LetsGo67	slow down would suggest something along the lines of a memory leak, or a hardware error, have you looked at what system resources are in use when it's quick and then when it's slow (something like top would do)
2009-12-10T04:25:00.000Z	ikonia	LetsGo67	did you see you where using an acer device ?
2011-05-10T17:28:00.000Z	ikonia	LetsGo67	the connector has nothing to do with your video cards capabilities
2011-05-10T17:30:00.000Z	LetsGo67	ikonia	It should.
2011-05-10T17:30:00.000Z	ikonia	LetsGo67	why should it ?
