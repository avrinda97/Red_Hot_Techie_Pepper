2007-10-28T04:04:00.000Z	cwgannon		i have a simple fstab Q: i have a partition that i'd like to mount at a certain folder (/mnt/vbox), but i can't get the fstab line to do what i want it to ... it keeps putting icons on the desktop, even when i have "noauto" ... here's what the line is now: "UUID=ff9b6a4d-2d71-4feb-ac6e-adaecc87ce36 /mnt/vbox ext3 noauto,user,noexec,rw 0 1" ... thank you in advance
2007-10-28T04:05:00.000Z	cwgannon		is there something i can do to encourage people to help me out?  my question is utterly simple
2007-10-28T04:06:00.000Z	cwgannon		i have a simple fstab Q: i have a partition that i'd like to mount at a certain folder (/mnt/vbox), but i can't get the fstab line to do what i want it to ... it keeps putting icons on the desktop, even when i have "noauto" ... here's what the line is now: "UUID=ff9b6a4d-2d71-4feb-ac6e-adaecc87ce36 /mnt/vbox ext3 noauto,user,noexec,rw 0 1" ... thank you in advance
2007-10-28T04:07:00.000Z	cwgannon		please, it's just an fstab question that will take 30 seconds to answer
2007-10-28T04:08:00.000Z	cwgannon		if nobody here will take my question, where should i go?  i feel stupid posting a question about fstab on a forum when just about anybody in here could answer it
2007-10-28T04:10:00.000Z	guru	cwgannon	so then why not ask the question instead of asking about asking the question?
2007-10-28T04:10:00.000Z	cwgannon	guru	because i've c/p'ed it twice already, and i know how testy people in here can get about doing that
2007-10-28T04:11:00.000Z	guru	cwgannon	i did not see your question so could you copy it again so that i can try to help?
2007-10-28T04:11:00.000Z	cwgannon	guru	i have a simple fstab Q: i have a partition that i'd like to mount at a certain folder (/mnt/vbox), but i can't get the fstab line to do what i want it to ... it keeps putting icons on the desktop, even when i have "noauto" ... here's what the line is now: "UUID=ff9b6a4d-2d71-4feb-ac6e-adaecc87ce36 /mnt/vbox ext3 noauto,user,noexec,rw 0 1" ... thank you in advance
2007-10-28T04:12:00.000Z	guru	cwgannon	fstab is working correctly then (i remember the line you pasted earlier now). apparently something specific to your windowmanager is automounting that drive
2007-10-28T04:12:00.000Z	guru	cwgannon	try ps aux | grep auto and see if anything related to automounting shows up
2007-10-28T04:13:00.000Z	cwgannon	guru	one line, last part is "grep auto" -- nothing more i can discern from it
2007-10-28T04:13:00.000Z	guru	cwgannon	what windowmanager are you using?
2007-10-28T04:14:00.000Z	cwgannon	guru	X? compiz?
2007-10-28T04:14:00.000Z	guru	cwgannon	gnome, kde, windowmaker, etc
2007-10-28T04:14:00.000Z	cwgannon	guru	gnome
2007-10-28T04:14:00.000Z	guru	cwgannon	i'm not very familiar with gnome...maybe try searching the forums or google for 'gnome automount' or similar
2007-10-28T04:15:00.000Z	cwgannon	guru	thank you
2007-10-28T04:15:00.000Z	guru	cwgannon	no problem. your fstab entry does look correct so it at least helps narrow your search
2007-10-28T04:16:00.000Z	cwgannon	guru	am i right, though, to believe that that fstab line should mount that partition on that folder at startup but should not create a desktop icon for it?
2007-10-28T04:17:00.000Z	guru	cwgannon	yes, gnome (or something running as part of gnome) is taking care of the icon for you
