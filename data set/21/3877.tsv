2009-09-01T07:19:00.000Z	Lakobos		anyone?
2009-09-01T07:20:00.000Z	Lakobos		oh
2009-09-01T07:20:00.000Z	Lakobos		ok
2009-09-01T07:21:00.000Z	Irishmanluke	Lakobos	check the perimissions on it
2009-09-01T07:21:00.000Z	Irishmanluke	Lakobos	wait how are you trying to run it and what happens when you do?
2009-09-01T07:22:00.000Z	Irishmanluke	Lakobos	but the icron daeomon is running?
2009-09-01T07:24:00.000Z	Irishmanluke	Lakobos	ps aux | grep icron and see if it's running, sorry if you knew that but you're being unclear
2009-09-01T07:26:00.000Z	Irishmanluke	Lakobos	so you are sure the daemon is running? if so test the command on it's own I do not know incron but I've done alot of cronning
2009-09-01T07:27:00.000Z	Irishmanluke	Lakobos	and the command you are trying to run works outside of incron?
2009-09-01T07:28:00.000Z	Irishmanluke	Lakobos	this may sound like a dumb question but to be sure the script you are trying to run does run on it's own right?
2009-09-01T07:30:00.000Z	Irishmanluke	Lakobos	and after you entered in the command with incrontab it said that the incrobtab was successfully installed or something like that?
2009-09-01T07:34:00.000Z	Irishmanluke	Lakobos	it seems like either the command is wrong or the filesystem event didn't happen
2009-09-01T07:38:00.000Z	Irishmanluke	Lakobos	I do not know, run dmesg | tail -f plug the device in and see what happens
2009-09-01T07:41:00.000Z	Irishmanluke	Lakobos	that is see what happens with that commands
2009-09-01T07:44:00.000Z	Irishmanluke	Lakobos	it seems like nothing is happening when you plug the device in.  Are you sure the device is mounting, what is the device btw?
2009-09-01T07:45:00.000Z	Irishmanluke	Lakobos	are you sure it's mounting? can you see the data on it?
2009-09-01T07:46:00.000Z	Irishmanluke	Lakobos	I have no clue then
2009-09-01T07:48:00.000Z	Irishmanluke	Lakobos	no clue
2009-09-01T07:50:00.000Z	Irishmanluke	Lakobos	you could try this but it seems your way should work http://reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html
2009-09-01T07:51:00.000Z	Irishmanluke	Lakobos	I don't really know how to do this but you should be able to write a udev rule which runs a command when your drive is mounted
2009-09-01T07:54:00.000Z	Irishmanluke	Lakobos	sorry I cannot help you
