2010-05-27T00:08:00.000Z	schweegi		does anybody know how i can recover GRUB to start ubuntu
2010-05-27T00:08:00.000Z	schweegi		?
2010-05-27T00:09:00.000Z	mgolisch	schweegi	looked at the wiki yet? iam quite sure it has a section about recovering grub in the grub atricle
2010-05-27T00:10:00.000Z	schweegi	mgolisch	yes, but i'm at a live disc yet. i try to revover GRUB from the live disc, but the terminal shows me always an error :(
2010-05-27T00:11:00.000Z	mgolisch	schweegi	what error and what command do you use? and more important what is the problem?
2010-05-27T00:11:00.000Z	schweegi		does lucid have grub 1 or 2 ?
2010-05-27T00:11:00.000Z	mgolisch	schweegi	grub2
2010-05-27T00:11:00.000Z	mgolisch		grub2 came with 9.10
2010-05-27T00:11:00.000Z	mgolisch		i think
2010-05-27T00:11:00.000Z	schweegi		the problem is, that Grub started in a terminal so that i can't select an operating system from a list
2010-05-27T00:12:00.000Z	mgolisch	schweegi	hm what did you do for that to happen?
2010-05-27T00:13:00.000Z	schweegi	mgolisch	i'm sorry. i looked up for grub 1 and not for 2.. that can't be functional.
2010-05-27T00:15:00.000Z	schweegi	mgolisch	the terminal shows me an error that i must tell them the filesystemtype when i try this: sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt
2010-05-27T00:15:00.000Z	mgolisch	schweegi	what filesystem does sda2 have?
2010-05-27T00:16:00.000Z	schweegi	mgolisch	gparted says that sda2 is extended
2010-05-27T00:16:00.000Z	schweegi	mgolisch	sda5 is ext4
2010-05-27T00:17:00.000Z	mgolisch	schweegi	so its probably sda5 then
2010-05-27T00:17:00.000Z	schweegi	mgolisch	on sda5 is / located. is there also grub installed?
2010-05-27T00:18:00.000Z	mgolisch	schweegi	if you do not have a seperate /boot partition then yes
2010-05-27T00:21:00.000Z	schweegi	mgolisch	thank you :) but what must i type into the nano /etc/default/grub? the wiki tells me that i must edit it. afterwards i should run update-grub ..
2010-05-27T00:24:00.000Z	mgolisch	schweegi	no idea, doesnt seem like there is anything intresting to set there
