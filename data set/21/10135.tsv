2005-05-16T07:56:00.000Z	jamesio		the fear I have is that I have 3 monitors and winxp works well with it
2005-05-16T07:57:00.000Z	jamesio		anyone here near New Orleans?
2005-05-16T07:58:00.000Z	jamesio		ok, first real question: if I'm planning on the system to be a server, would you suggest that I install it using the "server" option?
2005-05-16T07:59:00.000Z	jamesio		it helped me on a laptop.  it installed everything and I was able to play cds and dvds right away
2005-05-16T08:00:00.000Z	jamesio		seveas, any issues with the gui locking up after long periods of non-use?
2005-05-16T08:00:00.000Z	jamesio		the system used to sit in a closet without monitor/mouse/kb and ran for weeks at a time
2005-05-16T08:01:00.000Z	jamesio		seveas, I just mean the gui using more resources than a prompt-only machine
2005-05-16T08:02:00.000Z	jamesio		I know that.  what I'm asking is that if you had any experience with the gui running for weeks at a time... if it'll just lock up (like windows does)
2005-05-16T08:02:00.000Z	jamesio		ok.  the end result is that I want the system to be a samba server and run rsync to back up the files on it
2005-05-16T08:03:00.000Z	jamesio		and I'll have to investigate freenx
2005-05-16T08:04:00.000Z	Nalioth	jamesio	you may run your box forever (or as long as the power company lets you)
2005-05-16T08:05:00.000Z	Nalioth	jamesio	however, the more wild and crazy you get with your box, ymmv
2005-05-16T08:07:00.000Z	Nalioth	jamesio	then you should be able to run forever (ILM has a linux box that has been in constant use for over 7 years)
2005-05-16T08:07:00.000Z	Nalioth	jamesio	i am using my iBook also
2005-05-16T08:11:00.000Z	Nalioth	jamesio	i wonder where i was in line.. .. .. .. :P
2005-05-16T08:11:00.000Z	Nalioth	jamesio	ubuntu is the most user friendliest (out-of-the-box) distro i've foune
2005-05-16T08:31:00.000Z	Nalioth	jamesio	have you had success running java on PPC?
2005-05-18T09:27:00.000Z	Nalioth	jamesio	who prefers apples over oranges
2005-05-18T09:28:00.000Z	Nalioth	jamesio	who like blue over red?
2005-05-18T09:28:00.000Z	Nalioth	jamesio	it makes little or no difference, i believe they are both journaled file systems
2005-05-22T08:34:00.000Z	Nalioth	jamesio	great!
