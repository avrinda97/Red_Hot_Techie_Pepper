2008-08-05T15:47:00.000Z	EF_Codd		If I get good enough at Ubuntu, should i move up to Debian?
2008-08-05T15:48:00.000Z	EF_Codd		I'll be needing an answer. Thank you.
2008-08-05T15:48:00.000Z	Slart	EF_Codd	yes.. and then you continue to level 3.. there are cheat codes available too ;) ...
2008-08-05T15:48:00.000Z	EF_Codd	Slart	excellent!
2008-08-05T15:48:00.000Z	EF_Codd	Slart	i assume level 3 would be a BSD
2008-08-05T15:49:00.000Z	Slart	EF_Codd	no.. debian and ubuntu are different.. not levels above or under each other
2008-08-05T15:49:00.000Z	Slart	EF_Codd	find a system you like, that you understand and can work with.
2008-08-05T15:49:00.000Z	EF_Codd	Slart	you don't say
2008-08-05T15:49:00.000Z	EF_Codd	Slart	like, i'm allowed to recompile my kernel with one, and not the other
2008-08-05T15:50:00.000Z	Slart	EF_Codd	I don't think there is a system that doesn't allow you to compile your own kernels.. (perhaps windows).. some encourage it more than others though
2008-08-05T15:50:00.000Z	EF_Codd	Slart	ah, i should have put 'allowed' in '' ... what I mean is, ask about re-compiling here and see the response
2008-08-05T15:51:00.000Z	EF_Codd	Slart	anyway I'm finished being facetious
2008-08-05T15:51:00.000Z	Slart	EF_Codd	hehe.. correct.. but try gentoo if you like compiling stuff.. or one of those linux from scratch systems.. great way to learn about linux
2008-08-05T15:52:00.000Z	EF_Codd	Slart	did that about 15 years ago ;)
2008-08-05T15:52:00.000Z	EF_Codd	Slart	my first 'real' job was with AIX as well
2008-08-05T15:52:00.000Z	EF_Codd	Slart	:)
2008-08-05T15:53:00.000Z	Slart	EF_Codd	hehe.. good old systems
2008-08-05T15:53:00.000Z	EF_Codd	Slart	hey, enough of the 'old' ;)
2008-08-05T15:53:00.000Z	EF_Codd	Slart	we still use an RS/6000
2008-08-05T15:54:00.000Z	Slart	EF_Codd	what change things that work.. and keep on working.. but this is getting !ot
2008-08-05T15:55:00.000Z	EF_Codd	Slart	yeah, that's our thinking .. hell, we have a DNS machine running SunOS
