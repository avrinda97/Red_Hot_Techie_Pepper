2007-04-19T11:25:00.000Z	respa		how do I disable sudo and set a root password?
2007-04-19T11:26:00.000Z	Agrajag	respa	if you disable sudo, you will break things like update-manager that usegksudo to gain root privileges
2007-04-19T11:27:00.000Z	Agrajag	respa	sudo will never ask for a root password, it's always the user's password.
2007-04-19T11:28:00.000Z	respa	Agrajag	so every user on the system can perform root commands?
2007-04-19T11:28:00.000Z	Agrajag	respa	no
2007-04-19T11:28:00.000Z	Agrajag	respa	only users in the admin group can
2007-04-19T11:30:00.000Z	respa	Agrajag	if I dont want  to be a user in the admin group, how do I use root commands?
2007-04-19T11:32:00.000Z	Agrajag	respa	no
2007-04-19T11:32:00.000Z	Agrajag	respa	if you set a root password, all that happens is you're allowed to use su to change your user to root, or to log in directly as root
2007-04-19T11:33:00.000Z	Agrajag	respa	by default, only the first user you create, when installing the OS, is allowed to use sudo. So it's not like every user gets to be root whenever they want.
2007-04-19T11:34:00.000Z	respa	Agrajag	ok, if a regular user wants to use a root command and he knows the password, what does he do? sudo command? then he needs to know the root password or his password will be ok?
2007-04-19T11:35:00.000Z	Agrajag	respa	IF the user that wants to use root is in the admin group, he can use sudo and then his own password.
2007-04-19T11:35:00.000Z	Agrajag	respa	if the user is NOt in the admin group, sudo will not allow him root privileges, no matter what password he provides.
2007-04-19T11:36:00.000Z	Agrajag	respa	in contrast, if you just give root a password, anyone who knows that password can get root access.
2007-04-19T11:36:00.000Z	respa	Agrajag	thats what I want.. regular user (not admin group) to use sudo, but only if this user knows the root password
2007-04-19T11:36:00.000Z	Agrajag	respa	why wouldn't you just add the users who you want to have root access to the admin group?
2007-04-19T11:37:00.000Z	Agrajag	respa	is this going to be a system used by many people?
2007-04-19T11:37:00.000Z	respa	Agrajag	this is my personal computer, but other friends use it sometimes
2007-04-19T11:37:00.000Z	Agrajag	respa	why would your friends need root access?
2007-04-19T11:39:00.000Z	Agrajag	respa	if you're going to do that, you'd better make sure root has a password beforehand.
2007-04-19T11:40:00.000Z	respa	Agrajag	yes, thanks
