2006-03-19T08:57:00.000Z	TheWrench		ok, so perhaps: 25GB (NTFS) for windows, 10GB (ext3) for Ububtu, 100GB (fat32) for media, 40GB (NTFS) for windows application, 25GB (ext3) for Ubuntu applications.  Total 200GB.
2006-03-19T08:57:00.000Z	TheWrench		what doyou think?
2006-03-19T08:58:00.000Z	Falstius	TheWrench	if you mostly use linux, consider using ext3 for your media partition and loading an ext3 driver in windows.
2006-03-19T08:59:00.000Z	Falstius	TheWrench	you don't need 25GB for apps ... I have 7.5 GB for apps and that is just barely halffull (and I have most things installed twice! 32/64 bits)
2006-03-19T09:00:00.000Z	Falstius	TheWrench	and that includes all of the system apps.
2006-03-19T09:04:00.000Z	Falstius	TheWrench	Why don't you try 15 GB for windows, 40 GB for your warez, 10 GB for /, 15 GB for /home and the rest for media.
2006-03-19T09:05:00.000Z	Falstius	TheWrench	it is very possible, just not efficient :)
2006-03-19T09:05:00.000Z	TheWrench	Falstius	why is itnot efficient?
2006-03-19T09:06:00.000Z	Falstius	TheWrench	applications in Linux don't eat up harddrive in the same way as windows so devoting a large amount of space to them is impratical (unless you're running special CAD software or some such)
2006-03-19T09:08:00.000Z	Falstius	TheWrench	yep.  Although fat32 is pretty lame ... ext3 with ext3 drivers for windows or NTFS support in Linux is nicer ... but those both take some special loving.  So go with fat32 your first time.
2006-03-19T09:11:00.000Z	TheWrench	Falstius	ok, now for the dumb questions.  why do you say 10g for / and 15g for /home?  what does this mean? alternatively, where should I go to find out?
2006-03-19T09:12:00.000Z	Falstius	TheWrench	/ will be where all of your system configuration and program files go.  And where your logs and such are.  /home is where your personal configuration and files will be.
2006-03-19T09:18:00.000Z	Falstius	TheWrench	don't forget 1 GB for swap space (that is what Linux uses when it runs out of RAM).
2006-03-19T09:19:00.000Z	Falstius	TheWrench	do you have a blank disk now?  It is easier to install windows first and Linux second.  You can create empty partitions in the windows install and then format them during the Linux install.
2006-03-19T09:21:00.000Z	Falstius	TheWrench	you should probably put the partitions in the right order, something like C:, /, swap, extended(D:, /home, media)
2006-03-19T09:24:00.000Z	TheWrench	Falstius	you are saying I must create the partitions is a specific order?
2006-03-19T09:25:00.000Z	Falstius	TheWrench	no, but there are limitations.  If you put / too far back on the disk grub won't work (atleast older versions wouldn't, I haven't tried with the latest and greatest).
2006-03-19T09:36:00.000Z	Falstius	TheWrench	don't paste them to their own lines ...
2006-03-19T09:40:00.000Z	Falstius	TheWrench	that should work happily.  How much RAM do you have?
2006-03-19T09:41:00.000Z	Falstius	TheWrench	that is the easiest way.  You should probably make a 1GB partition for "swap" too.
2006-03-19T09:57:00.000Z	Falstius	TheWrench	no, you format it as swap (instead of ext3, fat, etc)
