2007-04-27T16:34:00.000Z	pyrosim		I'm trying to install ubuntu on a generic dell box, and when the live CD tries to boot, it hangs right after the loading kernel progress bar.  I got the alternate version CD, and the text mode installer fails on the 'detect and mount cdrom' step.  I have a generic recent IDE cdrom drive, and FC6 detects it with no difficulties.  Any ideas?
2007-04-27T16:36:00.000Z	foxiness	pyrosim	can you checke the cd ?
2007-04-27T16:36:00.000Z	pyrosim	foxiness	I have the CD mounted and reading if FC6 right now
2007-04-27T16:36:00.000Z	pyrosim	foxiness	The CD has the right checksum
2007-04-27T16:38:00.000Z	foxiness	pyrosim	what a dell model you have?
2007-04-27T16:38:00.000Z	pyrosim	foxiness	Dimension 2400, but it is not the original CD drive
2007-04-27T16:39:00.000Z	pyrosim	foxiness	It's a K hypermedia DVD-RW thing
2007-04-27T16:39:00.000Z	foxiness	pyrosim	desktop ?
2007-04-27T16:39:00.000Z	pyrosim	foxiness	Yep
2007-04-27T16:44:00.000Z	pyrosim	foxiness	Any idea?
2007-04-27T16:44:00.000Z	foxiness	pyrosim	what the speed or write you did?
2007-04-27T16:46:00.000Z	foxiness	pyrosim	on some case you must wirte it below 16x ,8x is safe
2007-04-27T16:46:00.000Z	pyrosim	foxiness	I used 24x
2007-04-27T16:46:00.000Z	pyrosim	foxiness	Okay, I'll try that...
2007-04-27T16:46:00.000Z	pyrosim	foxiness	That seems kinda wierd, but I'll try it
2007-04-27T16:47:00.000Z	foxiness	pyrosim	when i do a search on google i found this https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.15/+bug/55444, and i dont found a lot
2007-04-27T16:48:00.000Z	pyrosim	foxiness	That's an entirely different problem
2007-04-27T16:48:00.000Z	pyrosim	foxiness	Mine doesn't even boot
2007-04-27T16:53:00.000Z	foxiness	pyrosim	yes and what i mean its work,just test it with diff speed or wirte
2007-04-27T05:17:00.000Z	pyrosim	foxiness	Ok, tried that, it didn't work
2007-04-27T05:21:00.000Z	foxiness	pyrosim	you can use alt+f2 to figure out why its stop 'in text mode' ,and alt+f1 or f2 on live-cd
