2008-06-12T03:30:00.000Z	tdela		does anyone here use cross over office? if so what are your thoughts on it, I need to design but I don't like to boot to windows too often to do it, if i could use an alternative, i would be in heaven.
2008-06-12T03:30:00.000Z	tdela		...or are there alternatives to cx office
2008-06-12T03:31:00.000Z	tdela		awesome, thanks.
2008-06-12T03:31:00.000Z	tdela		again :)
2008-06-12T03:32:00.000Z	tdela		even so, this looks good.
2008-06-12T03:32:00.000Z	tdela		thanks.
2008-06-12T03:33:00.000Z	tdela		ah, im a cs3 user.
2008-06-12T03:33:00.000Z	tdela		thats ok, vbox looks the best.
2008-06-12T03:33:00.000Z	tdela		why do i get so much spam on freenode now, amazing.
2008-06-12T03:33:00.000Z	tdela		feels like dalnet :p
2008-06-12T03:34:00.000Z	jeed	tdela	heard the CS3 portable edition works on wine
2008-06-12T03:34:00.000Z	tdela	jeed	Interesting, perhaps ill look into that as well. So far, i think vbox is my answer.
2008-06-12T03:35:00.000Z	jeed	tdela	it usually is for windows designers, aslong as you got a dual core prosessor and plenty of ram, that is
2008-06-12T03:36:00.000Z	tdela	jeed	I dont have duo core heh :(
2008-06-12T03:36:00.000Z	jeed	tdela	anything dual core, otherwise windows inside *nix tends to be quite laggy, esp if your running CS3 on top :), its double the OS and double the resources
2008-06-12T03:37:00.000Z	tdela	jeed	I remember back in the day I used crossover office with photoshop 7.0 flawlessy for a year or so, I don't plan on doing heavy design work in linux, more like flatten the psd and grab some sections of it as a I built web applications. So i don't think memory or CPU is going to be a real issue.
2008-06-12T03:38:00.000Z	tdela	jeed	though I could be wrong :)
2008-06-12T03:38:00.000Z	jeed	tdela	if you use a VM its gunna put the resources of windows + the vm backend running on top of the resources your linux uses, so it can get laggy
2008-06-12T03:39:00.000Z	jeed	tdela	whats your prosessor/ram?
2008-06-12T03:39:00.000Z	tdela	jeed	ahh, I have 3GB of ram and an AMD 2.2GHz
2008-06-12T03:39:00.000Z	jeed	tdela	thats enough
