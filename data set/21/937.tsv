2011-05-01T11:23:00.000Z	thegoodcushion		Is it too early for me to ask what the stance is on Unity/GNOME in 11.10?
2011-05-01T11:24:00.000Z	PythonPup	thegoodcushion	I have seen an announcement that the Gnome desktop will not be in 11.10.  I don't know all the details.
2011-05-01T11:26:00.000Z	PythonPup	thegoodcushion	see https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity/+bug/739812/comments/5 for confirmation
2011-05-01T11:28:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	PythonPup	that's interesting, but it's hardly a definitive statement on the matter
2011-05-01T11:29:00.000Z	PythonPup	thegoodcushion	I generally take Marks word as a decision.  But, you can decide for yourself.
2011-05-01T11:29:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	PythonPup	Oops, I didn't check the author's name
2011-05-01T11:29:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	PythonPup	okay, I think you're right
2011-05-01T11:39:00.000Z	PythonPup	thegoodcushion	I am concerned, too.  But, I hope not.
2011-05-01T11:39:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	PythonPup	Seriously, Ubuntu has been the most popular distro for years now.  With this Unity business, it's finished
2011-05-01T11:40:00.000Z	PythonPup	thegoodcushion	You are too harsh.  For the next 6 months, there is no problem.  If Uniuty bothers you, just use Gnome.  Let them work out the bugs a bit.
2011-05-01T11:41:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	PythonPup	I'll stay with 10.04.  I'm doing coding mainly so it's not like I need a recent release
2011-05-01T11:44:00.000Z	PythonPup	thegoodcushion	Fedora uses GNOME 3.  I agree with Mark that it was a risky choice to go with GNOME 3.  Or, at least it is fair to say it looked like that early on.  It seems to have worked out, but it has its own odd behaviours.
2011-05-01T11:44:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	PythonPup	the current version of Fedora?
2011-05-01T11:45:00.000Z	PythonPup	thegoodcushion	No, the one in Beta.
2011-05-01T11:45:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	PythonPup	Okay, good.  I'm running Fedora 14 and it has GNOME 2.  I don't like the Fedora look and feel as much as Ubuntu
2011-05-01T11:46:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	PythonPup	But if Ubuntu continues to move toward unity and away from GNOME, I'm going to Fedora or Debian
2011-05-01T11:46:00.000Z	PythonPup	thegoodcushion	I like Ubuntu better, too.  But, if you want to try GNOME 3, thge Fedora 15 beta is a good place.
2011-05-01T11:47:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	PythonPup	I'm coding a Wikipedia bot so I want to only use release software
2011-05-01T11:47:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	PythonPup	I can't run my code on beta anything
2011-05-01T11:48:00.000Z	PythonPup	thegoodcushion	GNOME 3 is very new.  So, you can try the beta or wait.
2011-05-01T15:12:00.000Z	PythonPup	thegoodcushion	ext4 for 11.04.
