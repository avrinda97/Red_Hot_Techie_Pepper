2005-10-28T14:42:00.000Z	bob2	hopper	right, so you should have joined the channel and said "I get this http://blah error when I try to access vsftpd"
2005-10-28T14:42:00.000Z	bob2	hopper	look in the config file then
2005-10-28T14:42:00.000Z	hopper	bob2	i have already

2005-10-28T14:44:00.000Z	bob2	hopper	and it says that, and you then checked /etc/passwd and found out whether the ftp user exists?
2005-10-28T14:49:00.000Z	hopper	bob2	OMG stupid moment
2005-10-28T14:50:00.000Z	bob2	hopper	the postinst script should have created one
2005-10-28T14:50:00.000Z	bob2	hopper	oh, you didn't install the ubuntu package?
2005-10-28T14:50:00.000Z	hopper	bob2	I didn't have a ftp user ;-)
2005-10-28T14:51:00.000Z	bob2	hopper	I know, but the ubuntu package should have created it for you
2005-10-28T14:51:00.000Z	hopper	bob2	yeah... not using ubuntu ;-)
