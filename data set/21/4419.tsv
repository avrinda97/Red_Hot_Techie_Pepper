2008-05-03T05:09:00.000Z	aLeSD		hi all
2008-05-03T05:09:00.000Z	aLeSD		why compiz make my pc slower ?
2008-05-03T05:09:00.000Z	fde	aLeSD	because your PC is doing more.
2008-05-03T05:10:00.000Z	aLeSD	fde	but I was thinking that the Gpu was working
2008-05-03T05:11:00.000Z	fde	aLeSD	It is...
2008-05-03T05:11:00.000Z	fde	aLeSD	So is the CPU though...
2008-05-03T05:12:00.000Z	aLeSD	fde	: I don't understand what is the difference between scroll a text with compiz or metacity
2008-05-03T05:13:00.000Z	fde	aLeSD	Neither scroll, they are just Window Managers.
2008-05-03T05:13:00.000Z	fde	aLeSD	Compiz and Cairo both are fighting for GPU resources though... and Cairo draws most widgets.
2008-05-03T05:14:00.000Z	aLeSD	fde	Starnestommy I don't understand if compiz is the right way
2008-05-03T05:14:00.000Z	fde	aLeSD	I don't use Compiz because I don't need those effects... it's something neat to show friends, but that's about it.
2008-05-03T05:17:00.000Z	fde	aLeSD	there was a branch of Metacity that was going to... but it's looking like Compiz will just replace it in Gnome.
2008-05-03T05:18:00.000Z	aLeSD	fde	... I can't belive it
2008-05-03T05:18:00.000Z	aLeSD	fde	. compiz with all effect disactived ... is slower
2008-05-03T05:18:00.000Z	fde	aLeSD	You don't have to... it is what is being discussed.
2008-05-03T05:19:00.000Z	fde	aLeSD	Hence why it's not the case yet.
2008-11-18T23:45:00.000Z	fde	aLeSD	/var/log/samba/
2008-11-18T23:46:00.000Z	aLeSD	fde	the general one ?
2008-11-18T23:46:00.000Z	fde	aLeSD	what do you mean the general one?
2008-11-18T23:46:00.000Z	fde	aLeSD	that is where all samba logs go
2008-11-18T23:46:00.000Z	aLeSD	fde	thanks
