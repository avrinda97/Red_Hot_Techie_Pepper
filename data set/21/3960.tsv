2010-03-06T23:49:00.000Z	T`		Hi, i'm having that same issue
2010-03-06T23:49:00.000Z	T`		can someone help me with how to fix it?
2010-03-06T23:50:00.000Z	T`		anyone know how i can fix a race condition between the networking and dhcp3 server startup? It exists on the latest ubuntu. There is also someone who wrote about it in great lengths here: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/upstart-devel/2010-January/001168.html
2010-03-06T23:50:00.000Z	T`		the problem is dhcp3 server needs my br0 bridge interface up before startup
2010-03-06T23:51:00.000Z	guntbert	T`	"latest" = lucid or karmic?
2010-03-06T23:51:00.000Z	T`	guntbert	9.10
2010-03-06T23:53:00.000Z	T`	guntbert	the problem is bridge interface takes a while to come up after startup i believe.. so dhcp3 shouldn't start until then
2010-03-06T23:55:00.000Z	guntbert	T`	understood - right now (without being good with upstart) I'd try to rename the dhcp3 script to something with a higher number (i.e. S99dhcp3) or so

2010-03-06T23:56:00.000Z	T`	guntbert	i tried that.. in fact i put '/etc/init.d/dhcp3-server restart' in my rc.local which is run last
2010-03-06T23:56:00.000Z	T`	guntbert	i think bridge takes a while longer even after the rc scripts are done execution
2010-03-06T23:57:00.000Z	T`	guntbert	found another set of people with same problem: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1326100
2010-03-06T23:59:00.000Z	guntbert	T`	then I have to give up - sorry
2010-03-07T00:00:00.000Z	T`	guntbert	hmm.. this might work for me.. gonna try it.. someone suggested some upstart hack in #10... http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1360974
2010-03-07T00:01:00.000Z	guntbert	T`	looks promising :)
2010-03-07T00:02:00.000Z	T`	guntbert	i added that script in upstart. do you knomw how the ordering works for upstart?
2010-03-07T00:02:00.000Z	T`	guntbert	how do i know if the default dhcp3 server script and upstart wont collide?
2010-03-07T00:04:00.000Z	guntbert	T`	sorry - no - just disable the original - see http://www.unixtutorial.org/2009/01/disable-service-startup-in-ubuntu/
2010-03-07T00:05:00.000Z	T`	guntbert	ok thanks
2010-03-07T00:05:00.000Z	guntbert	T`	np and Good luck :-)
