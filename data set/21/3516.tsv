2009-12-09T00:30:00.000Z	ManDay		Whats vmlinuz?
2009-12-09T00:30:00.000Z	ManDay		and why is it sitting in my /
2009-12-09T00:30:00.000Z	dajhorn	ManDay	That is the Linux kernel.
2009-12-09T00:30:00.000Z	ManDay	dajhorn	so wth is it sitting in /?
2009-12-09T00:31:00.000Z	dajhorn	ManDay	Do you have a very old system?  What version of Ubuntu do you have?
2009-12-09T00:33:00.000Z	ManDay	dajhorn	nevermind it seens to be just an ln
2010-07-21T00:13:00.000Z	dajhorn	ManDay	The Ubuntu kernel is not exactly what you'd find at www.kernel.org or in Debian -- the Canonical/Ubuntu kernel team makes changes for the Ubuntu distro.
2010-07-21T00:14:00.000Z	ManDay	dajhorn	are these patches to the vanilla kernel related to some specific field or just random improvements canonical deems good for us?
2010-07-21T00:15:00.000Z	dajhorn	ManDay	Both.
2010-07-21T00:15:00.000Z	ManDay	dajhorn	what is your opinion - how impacting are those improvements?
2010-07-21T00:15:00.000Z	dajhorn	ManDay	Usually improvements, especially for non-free drivers.
2010-07-21T00:17:00.000Z	ManDay	dajhorn	I deem that pretty "serious" - reason enough for me to prefer the ubuntu kernel over vanilla - the main advantage of ubuntu i always saw was how compatibel it is.
2010-07-21T00:21:00.000Z	dajhorn	ManDay	Read the changelog file for the kernel that you are running.  The kernel maintainers put references to things like CVE in the changelog file.
2010-07-21T00:21:00.000Z	ManDay	dajhorn	thank you!
2010-07-21T00:21:00.000Z	dajhorn	ManDay	Welcome.
2010-09-28T01:14:00.000Z	dajhorn	ManDay	Skype was broken in Maverick today, but is now fixed.  10.10 questions should go to #ubuntu+1
2010-09-28T01:15:00.000Z	ManDay	dajhorn	im on 10.04 as i said
2010-09-28T01:15:00.000Z	dajhorn	ManDay	Why are you mentioning 10.10?
2010-09-28T01:16:00.000Z	ManDay	dajhorn	i am not sure whether it has an influence on the updates for 10.04 dajhorn
2010-09-28T01:16:00.000Z	dajhorn	ManDay	Nothing in 10.10 will be installed unless you ask for it, or acknowledge the upgrade.
2010-09-28T01:17:00.000Z	ManDay	dajhorn	i just thought maybe an update for 10.04 was made by someone developing on 10.10 or so...
