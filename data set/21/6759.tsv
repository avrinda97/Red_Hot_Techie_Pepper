2007-02-24T13:35:00.000Z	arrenlex	stratusfear	That's libcaca. It needs to be compiled with it. What does "mplayer -vo help | grep -i caca | wc -l" say?
2007-02-24T13:37:00.000Z	arrenlex	stratusfear	-l, not -s.
2007-02-24T13:37:00.000Z	arrenlex	stratusfear	Also, irc is not a terminal. :)
2007-02-24T13:37:00.000Z	stratusfear	arrenlex	it say 1
2007-02-24T13:38:00.000Z	arrenlex	stratusfear	Then mplayer -vo caca <moviefile>
2007-02-24T13:41:00.000Z	stratusfear	arrenlex	it say your system is to slow to play this
2007-02-24T13:42:00.000Z	arrenlex	stratusfear	Get a better CPU =P
2007-02-24T13:42:00.000Z	arrenlex	stratusfear	Are you playing it from a network?
2007-02-24T13:43:00.000Z	arrenlex	stratusfear	Is it actually playing too slow?
2007-02-24T13:44:00.000Z	stratusfear	arrenlex	yes it said same shit using -vo aa and i did the same thing you told the other guy to make mplayer faster
2007-02-24T13:44:00.000Z	arrenlex	stratusfear	That doesn't apply to you.
2007-02-24T13:45:00.000Z	arrenlex	stratusfear	Don't take someone else's prescription medicine.
2007-02-24T13:45:00.000Z	arrenlex	stratusfear	Is it actually playing too slow?
2007-02-24T13:45:00.000Z	arrenlex	stratusfear	If so, try -framedrop or -hardframedrop.
2007-02-24T13:45:00.000Z	stratusfear	arrenlex	that worked using -vo aa it doesn't say that anymore
2007-02-24T13:45:00.000Z	stratusfear	arrenlex	ok
2007-02-24T13:50:00.000Z	stratusfear	arrenlex	is working it doesn't say it anymore
2007-02-24T13:50:00.000Z	arrenlex	stratusfear	Okay. Enjoy.
