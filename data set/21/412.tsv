2012-02-09T10:40:00.000Z	joallard_		I am experiencing frustration right now
2012-02-09T10:41:00.000Z	joallard_		Some are better for some people, right?
2012-02-09T10:41:00.000Z	joallard_		People could be "wrong"
2012-02-09T10:42:00.000Z	joallard_		Okay, pass.
2012-02-09T10:42:00.000Z	joallard_		How do I debug xchat?
2012-02-09T10:42:00.000Z	joallard_		Segmentation fault
2012-02-09T10:42:00.000Z	joallard_		Crash
2012-02-09T10:43:00.000Z	joallard_		Yes.
2012-02-09T10:43:00.000Z	joallard_		I'm used to seeing *a lot* of bugs in my ubuntu experience. *frustration*
2012-02-09T10:43:00.000Z	joallard_		"<joallard_> Okay, pass."
2012-02-09T10:44:00.000Z	graft	joallard_	try pidgin or irssi, they're both great
2012-02-09T10:44:00.000Z	graft	joallard_	maybe you can run it through gdb, but if it's just seg faulting i would try compiling it yourself or downloading a different version of it
2012-02-09T10:45:00.000Z	graft	joallard_	you build it yourself
2012-02-09T10:45:00.000Z	graft	joallard_	if you include them when you build it, yes
2012-02-09T10:46:00.000Z	graft	joallard_	why do you want to go to this much trouble to fix xchat?
2012-02-09T10:46:00.000Z	graft	joallard_	wouldn't it be easier to use irssi or pidgin?
2012-02-09T10:48:00.000Z	graft	joallard_	which distribution are you using?
2012-02-09T10:48:00.000Z	graft	joallard_	and what version of xchat?
2012-02-09T10:48:00.000Z	graft	joallard_	where did you get xchat version 0.30?
2012-02-09T10:48:00.000Z	joallard_	graft	already packaged from the repos
2012-02-09T10:49:00.000Z	graft	joallard_	no, the version in the repository is 2.8.8
