2007-10-06T14:50:00.000Z	arooni-mobile		and install windwos that way
2007-10-06T14:50:00.000Z	arooni-mobile		i really hate windows
2007-10-06T14:51:00.000Z	arooni-mobile		is vmware server == vmware player
2007-10-06T14:52:00.000Z	arooni-mobile		they aren't answering any qs :(
2007-10-06T14:52:00.000Z	arooni-mobile		so you'd reccomend player over all other choices
2007-10-06T14:52:00.000Z	arooni-mobile		ok
2007-10-06T14:53:00.000Z	arooni-mobile		what is a .rpm file?
2007-10-06T14:53:00.000Z	arooni-mobile		is that another type of archive?
2007-10-06T14:54:00.000Z	psyphen	arooni-mobile	i personally use virtualbox if you're wanting an open source virtualisation solution on a windows system
2007-10-06T14:59:00.000Z	psyphen	arooni-mobile	the cd and at least 1024mb ram and 10gb space. you can test safari and ie on xp just fine
2007-10-06T15:00:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	psyphen	so i should make a virtual 10GB drive?  thats the size you reccomend? and i should give virtual machine 1024 megs of ram?
2007-10-06T15:00:00.000Z	psyphen	arooni-mobile	perfect
2007-10-06T15:01:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	psyphen	it will just use my swap if it needs to right?  i usually almost use up all of my 2GB with running apps & such
2007-10-06T15:03:00.000Z	psyphen	arooni-mobile	i hope so. i've never used vmware player. my xp workstation at the company happily runs fedora, gentoo, and ubuntu using virtualbox despite management insisting on purchasing vmware servers
2007-10-06T15:04:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	psyphen	hmm i'm installing both vmware and virtual box
2007-10-06T15:05:00.000Z	psyphen	arooni-mobile	good idea. it's really up to personal choice
2007-10-06T15:07:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	psyphen	i just installed virtualbox..... how do i run it?  virtualbox doesnt work
2007-10-06T15:11:00.000Z	psyphen	arooni-mobile	i only use dynamic drives for fat32 because otherwise fixed will be limited to 2gb on fat32. fixed drives are fine to preset the space you know you're going to use
2007-10-06T15:12:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	psyphen	does dynamic drive dramatically reduce the speed?  can you switch your mind later?  can you readjust fixed size later?
2007-10-06T15:14:00.000Z	psyphen	arooni-mobile	i'm not entirely sure. any time i've wanted to adjust the size of a virtual drive i start a new virtual machine and remove the old one. hopefully someone else can be more helpful
2007-10-06T15:21:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	psyphen	know how to solve this: The VirtualBox kernel driver is not accessible to the current user. Make sure that the user has write permissions for /dev/vboxdrv by adding them to the vboxusers groups. You will need to logout for the change to take effect..  ?  how do i add chasetoys to this user group
