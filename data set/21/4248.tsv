2008-06-05T01:07:00.000Z	Brandenatwork	yofel	no hidden files in trash
2008-06-05T01:08:00.000Z	yofel	Brandenatwork	try using the 'disk usage analyser' to find out what eats up your space
2008-06-05T01:14:00.000Z	Brandenatwork	yofel	well the disk analyzer looks right, says my home is 100% when i delete something it shows it has been deleted when I run the analyzer, but I am still at 0 free space, ths is after I deleted a 700 mb iso
2008-06-05T01:15:00.000Z	yofel	Brandenatwork	try deleting something using the 'rm' command in the terminal
2008-06-05T01:17:00.000Z	Brandenatwork	yofel	after using rm, I still have 0 bytes remaining
2008-06-05T01:19:00.000Z	yofel	Brandenatwork	do you get any error messages?

2008-06-05T01:21:00.000Z	yofel	Brandenatwork	I'm running out of ideas... | try deleting something as root (or sudo) or try fsck on your partition using the live cd
2008-06-05T01:21:00.000Z	Brandenatwork	yofel	yeah I am in root right now with nautilus, I am looking for the .trash
2008-06-05T01:22:00.000Z	yofel	Brandenatwork	as of ubuntu 8.04 the .trash folder was moved to .local/share/trash
2008-06-05T01:23:00.000Z	Brandenatwork	yofel	i appreciate your help, I am going to do a restart, then its live cd time
2008-06-05T01:23:00.000Z	yofel	Brandenatwork	sorry if I couldn't help...
