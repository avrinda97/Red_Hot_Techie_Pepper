2006-01-28T16:08:00.000Z	hamdan		the problem is, ive just installed ubuntu on one of my pc's located on a LAN (other pcs are win xp based). the installation went well, however i cant seem to print on a printer attached to one of the other pcs. can anyone help?
2006-01-28T16:09:00.000Z	mitrovarr	hamdan	 is the printer shared using windows file/network sharing or a networked printer?
2006-01-28T16:10:00.000Z	hamdan	mitrovarr	its just using windows file/network/printer sharing
2006-01-28T16:10:00.000Z	mitrovarr	hamdan	 ok.  Go to system -> administration -> printing, then 'new printer'
2006-01-28T16:11:00.000Z	mitrovarr	hamdan	 Then select 'network printer' and change the option box from CUPS to Windows Printer (smb)
2006-01-28T16:12:00.000Z	mitrovarr	hamdan	 Hopefully the samba shares on the network will appear and you can find your printer and connect to it.  And hope there's a driver for it, because linux printer support is not total.
2006-01-28T16:13:00.000Z	hamdan	mitrovarr	: i have done all that i i have an icon in my printer window indicating the printer as ready, however when i try to print the printer does not print.
2006-01-28T16:14:00.000Z	mitrovarr	hamdan	 So the driver list had the driver for your printer, right?
2006-01-28T16:14:00.000Z	hamdan	mitrovarr	: yes
2006-01-28T16:14:00.000Z	hamdan	mitrovarr	: laserjet-4-plus
2006-01-28T16:15:00.000Z	mitrovarr	hamdan	 Hmm...  What are you trying to print with?  I can't get some programs to print, like the ones use gimp-print
2006-01-28T16:17:00.000Z	mitrovarr	hamdan	 It might help if you went over to the XP system and watched the print monitor as you tried to print, that'll show you if your computer is seeing the share and sending data
2006-01-28T16:17:00.000Z	hamdan	mitrovarr	im just trying to print from ubuntu..some office docs etc
2006-01-28T16:18:00.000Z	mitrovarr	hamdan	 I'm out of ideas, then.  I have gotten samba printing working in ubuntu, so it's not broken.
2006-01-28T16:19:00.000Z	mitrovarr	hamdan	 Your printer has 4 different drivers available in the printer dialogs, maybe you should try another?
2006-01-28T16:20:00.000Z	mitrovarr	hamdan	 after you select your printer from the list, you can choose a different driver for that specific printer from the dialog box under the list.  It's certainly worth trying to others to see if one of them works.
