2007-04-19T05:45:00.000Z	Amaranth	samk	yeah, broken copy :P
2007-04-19T05:45:00.000Z	Amaranth	samk	http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/menc-feat-mpeg4.html
2007-04-19T05:50:00.000Z	Amaranth	samk	i just gave you a link that said how
2007-04-19T05:50:00.000Z	samk	Amaranth	the link was broken
2007-04-19T05:50:00.000Z	Amaranth	samk	http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/menc-feat-mpeg4.html
2007-04-19T05:51:00.000Z	Amaranth	samk	I repasted a working link twice now :)
2007-04-19T05:52:00.000Z	Amaranth	samk	that is a free converter
2007-04-19T05:52:00.000Z	Amaranth	samk	and it's two lines you can copy and paste
2007-04-19T05:52:00.000Z	Amaranth	samk	all you have to do is change dvd://2 to the path to your file
2007-04-19T05:53:00.000Z	Amaranth	samk	and 'converter' you find will just be a GUI wrapper around those lines
