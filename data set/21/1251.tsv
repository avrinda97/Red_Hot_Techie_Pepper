2012-04-05T06:03:00.000Z	Chamunks		what repository would contain sun-java6-jre
2012-04-05T06:04:00.000Z	Chamunks		for some reason my default repos are not capable of giving me this package and im about to ragequit over it.
2012-04-05T06:04:00.000Z	Chamunks		you have no idea I'm having to deal with a terrible vps host that a friend of mine used and they are just the worst people.
2012-04-05T06:05:00.000Z	Chamunks		I am looking to run a minecraft server
2012-04-05T06:05:00.000Z	Chamunks		and need the jre...
2012-04-05T06:05:00.000Z	Chamunks		would jdk do the same things jre does I would imagine not :S
2012-04-05T06:06:00.000Z	Chamunks		I only have console
2012-04-05T06:06:00.000Z	Chamunks		access
2012-04-05T06:07:00.000Z	Chamunks		openjdk will not work correctly with minecraft servers.
2012-04-05T06:07:00.000Z	itaylor57	Chamunks	jre is run time, jdk is to compile, and includes jre
2012-04-05T06:07:00.000Z	Chamunks	itaylor57	thanks I will try jdk
2012-04-05T06:08:00.000Z	Chamunks	itaylor57	has no installation candidate.
2012-04-05T06:08:00.000Z	Chamunks		Fuuuuuuuu
2012-04-05T06:09:00.000Z	itaylor57		!java | Chamunks shows how to get which ever java you want
2012-04-05T06:12:00.000Z	Chamunks		I found a link thanks to ubbottu
2012-04-05T06:12:00.000Z	Chamunks		this should have theoretically fixed my issue http://www.duinsoft.nl/packages.php?t=en
2012-04-05T06:12:00.000Z	Chamunks		it apparently provides a sun-java repo
2012-04-05T06:12:00.000Z	Chamunks		http://www.duinsoft.nl/packages.php?t=en
2012-04-05T06:14:00.000Z	Chamunks		the link that I posted was in the ubottu response and it works perfectly :)
2012-04-05T06:14:00.000Z	Chamunks		java -version now echoes java version "1.6.0_31"
2012-04-05T06:14:00.000Z	itaylor57	Chamunks	good for you
