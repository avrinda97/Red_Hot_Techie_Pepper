2008-06-29T14:53:00.000Z	BoltClock	ActionParsnip	this seems to be for edgy. not sure if it applies to hardy :/
2008-06-29T14:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BoltClock	the settining up of the boot on usb is the same, then you can give it any distro you want, just because it says edgy doesnt mean it wont work cos it doesnt say @hardy@

2008-06-29T14:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BoltClock	its a media like a hard drive or a cd drive
2008-06-29T14:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BoltClock	linux sees them as the same thing, a folder
2008-06-29T14:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BoltClock	yes
2008-06-29T14:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BoltClock	just needs some work and delays cos USB ports take ages to come up
2008-06-29T14:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BoltClock	like a few seconds
2008-06-29T14:56:00.000Z	BoltClock	ActionParsnip	the articles all apply to any release and any derivative right?
2008-06-29T14:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BoltClock	its not hard at all, make a copy to another drive too then you can simply clone them when it wears out (they only have so many read / writes in them)
2008-06-29T14:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BoltClock	exactly, theres minor differences between but its essentailly debian
2008-11-12T17:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BoltClock	sudo killall
2008-11-12T17:16:00.000Z	BoltClock	ActionParsnip	neither does sudoing it
2008-11-12T17:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BoltClock	ps -ef | grep firefox
2008-11-12T17:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BoltClock	then sudo kill <pid>
2008-11-12T17:19:00.000Z	BoltClock	ActionParsnip	doesnt work
2008-11-12T17:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BoltClock	sounds like fun. are you loged in as a user or root?
2008-11-12T17:20:00.000Z	BoltClock	ActionParsnip	as a normal user
2008-11-12T17:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BoltClock	good
