2012-09-24T19:59:00.000Z	janusian		Hi,
2012-09-24T20:00:00.000Z	janusian		I'm experiencing a series of problems with running Ubuntu 12.04 on an Asus M5A78L-M motherboard. Most of them seem to be with respect to the on-board ATI Radeon HD3000 and Ubuntu's various drivers for it (both open source and proprietary).
2012-09-24T20:01:00.000Z	janusian		On first install, the system was working ok and, gave me the option to install "Additional Drivers". I went ahead and did that. After that point, I can't get video to playback properly.
2012-09-24T20:02:00.000Z	janusian		The screen flickers, whenever I move between desktops and generally, I am getting a crap graphics experience..
2012-09-24T20:02:00.000Z	janusian		I've looked online, but I can't seem to find any answers for reverting my ubuntu back to its initial state
2012-09-24T20:02:00.000Z	janusian		(I tried purging the fglrx)
2012-09-24T20:03:00.000Z	BluesKaj	janusian	did you reboot after installing the drivers ? i have to ask
2012-09-24T20:03:00.000Z	janusian	BluesKaj	yep, I've been trying out various drivers/"solutions"
2012-09-24T20:05:00.000Z	BluesKaj	janusian	some ppl have had success with the proprietary divers for ATI/Radeon from their website , but I'm not sure if that would apply in your case
2012-09-24T20:06:00.000Z	janusian	BluesKaj	I am currently running the proprietary drivers ... They have corrected the problem with video (for VLC anyway, totem doesn't work at all).
2012-09-24T20:06:00.000Z	BluesKaj	janusian	you should need to use compiz on the newer ubuntu OSs
2012-09-24T20:07:00.000Z	janusian	BluesKaj	I was under the assumption that they would be robust enough to try out - with my newer system (my old system was under powered and quite antiquated).
2012-09-24T20:09:00.000Z	BluesKaj	janusian	yes , VLC  ftw , definitely , but isn't compiz a bit long in the tooth for newer systems ?
2012-09-24T20:09:00.000Z	janusian	BluesKaj	dunno, I just wanted to use the "fancy" desktop cube and rotate functions
2012-09-24T20:10:00.000Z	BluesKaj	janusian	doesn't unity provide that without compiz? , KDE does
2012-09-24T20:11:00.000Z	janusian	BluesKaj	I was under the impression that compiz was necessary to do such things.
2012-09-24T20:12:00.000Z	BluesKaj	janusian	looks like you need compiz
2012-09-24T20:13:00.000Z	janusian	BluesKaj	is there any way to "restore" the system to an earlier point (ie a point earlier than my compiz muck-up_
2012-09-24T20:15:00.000Z	BluesKaj	janusian	you probly need to just change the graphics drivers , altho any other app changes will remain
2012-09-24T20:16:00.000Z	janusian	BluesKaj	how would I return the graphics driver to the original one?
2012-09-24T20:18:00.000Z	janusian	BluesKaj	k and thanks for the response :)
