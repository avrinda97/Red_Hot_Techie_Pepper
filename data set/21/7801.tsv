2007-03-02T12:52:00.000Z	wheels3572		is there a syntax to untar a file to a specific directory?
2007-03-02T12:53:00.000Z	soundray	wheels3572	'cd /target/dir ; tar zxf /path/to/file.tar'
2007-03-02T12:53:00.000Z	soundray	wheels3572	oops, drop the z unless it's gzipped
2007-03-02T12:53:00.000Z	wheels3572	soundray	target directory of the tar file then in the syntax where I want it
2007-03-02T12:53:00.000Z	wheels3572	soundray	tar.gz file
2007-03-02T12:54:00.000Z	soundray	wheels3572	pardon?
2007-03-02T12:55:00.000Z	wheels3572	soundray	im trying to unzip a tar.gz file and have it install in usr/share folder
2007-03-02T12:56:00.000Z	soundray	wheels3572	assuming it's on your desktop, you would do 'cd /usr/share ; sudo tar zxf $HOME/Desktop/file.tar.gz' (but you don't *really* want this)
2007-03-02T12:56:00.000Z	wheels3572	soundray	why dont I want it
2007-03-02T12:57:00.000Z	soundray	wheels3572	what's in it?
2007-03-02T12:58:00.000Z	soundray	wheels3572	I trust you will be able to adapt the syntax on your own
2007-03-02T12:59:00.000Z	soundray	wheels3572	I'm still not convinced you want that
2007-03-02T12:59:00.000Z	wheels3572	soundray	ok
2007-03-02T13:11:00.000Z	wheels3572	soundray	what's the executable file.  I just tried to get firefox 2.0.0.2 running I got it installed but what's the file to get it running itself?
2007-03-02T13:12:00.000Z	soundray	wheels3572	was that the .tar.gz you installed?
2007-03-02T13:12:00.000Z	wheels3572	soundray	yes
2007-03-02T13:13:00.000Z	soundray	wheels3572	I told you you didn't want that.
2007-03-02T13:13:00.000Z	soundray	wheels3572	you're heading the right way to totally mess up your system
2007-03-02T13:13:00.000Z	wheels3572	soundray	ok will wait
2007-03-02T13:14:00.000Z	soundray	wheels3572	read the message that ubotu will send and learn the ubuntu way please
2007-03-02T13:14:00.000Z	wheels3572	soundray	ok gotcha
