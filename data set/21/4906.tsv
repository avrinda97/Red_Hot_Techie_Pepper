2008-06-06T00:34:00.000Z	tesseracter		hi, im using a flash player that makes you click a button before you load flash content. I want it to load flash content on at least localhost. whats my first step?
2008-06-06T00:35:00.000Z	rrowell	tesseracter	are you talking about the "Flash Block" plugin for mozilla?
2008-06-06T00:36:00.000Z	tesseracter	rrowell	i dunno, its a big triangle(play button)
2008-06-06T00:36:00.000Z	rrowell		yeah, go to "tools" then "addons" and click on flasblock
2008-06-06T00:36:00.000Z	rrowell	tesseracter	Then you can add "approved" sites or turn it off completely...
2008-06-06T00:37:00.000Z	rrowell		no transcode people in the house?
2008-06-06T00:38:00.000Z	tesseracter	rrowell	looks like it isnt intalled - the only flash plugin is called "Shockwave Flash 9.0 r100"
2008-06-06T00:39:00.000Z	rrowell	tesseracter	You are looking in the wrong place then, cause I have flash9 and it isn't listed under "add-ons"
2008-06-06T00:39:00.000Z	rrowell	tesseracter	Tools->add-ons, then make sure you are on the "Extension" tab
2008-06-06T00:39:00.000Z	tesseracter	rrowell	or i have a different version...
2008-06-06T00:40:00.000Z	rrowell	tesseracter	doubtfull
2008-06-06T00:40:00.000Z	rrowell	tesseracter	i have both FF2 and FF3 installed here and it is the same on both
2008-06-06T00:40:00.000Z	rrowell	tesseracter	tools->addons, then look at the extensions tab
2008-06-06T00:42:00.000Z	rrowell		so no transcode people...   Does anyone know of a different program to turn .flv into xvid or mpeg4?
2008-06-06T00:43:00.000Z	tesseracter	rrowell	yep, no flash or flash related thing, but under "plugins" it is listed as 9.0 r100. the synaptic package im using is "flashplugin-nonfree"
2008-06-06T00:43:00.000Z	rrowell	tesseracter	so there is nothing at all on your extensions tab?
2008-06-06T00:44:00.000Z	rrowell		when you go to tools->add-ons and click the "extension" tab up top (looks like a puzzle piece)
2008-06-06T00:44:00.000Z	rrowell	tesseracter	you get nothing on that page?
2008-06-06T00:44:00.000Z	tesseracter	rrowell	"ubuntu firefox modifications"
2008-06-06T00:44:00.000Z	tesseracter	rrowell	with no prefs
2008-06-06T00:45:00.000Z	rrowell	tesseracter	you got me then, it sure sounds like you have flasblock installed though
