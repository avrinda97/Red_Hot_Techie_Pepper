2012-08-24T00:07:00.000Z	newbzilla		im not sure about that, do i check the same way i did for the flash?
2012-08-24T00:08:00.000Z	newbzilla		nope, fresh install
2012-08-24T00:10:00.000Z	newbzilla		mv ~/ (is there a space here) .mozilla?
2012-08-24T00:12:00.000Z	newbzilla		so i type it just like this then       mv ~/.mozilla ~/.backup.mozilla
2012-08-24T00:13:00.000Z	trond-	newbzilla	or if you want to use nautilus (file manager): First CTRL+H (to show hidden files and folders), then find .mozilla - then right click on it and choose rename - and rename it.
2012-08-24T00:18:00.000Z	trond-	newbzilla	have you searched the web for ubuntu firefox flash ?
2012-08-24T00:19:00.000Z	trond-	newbzilla	should be an easy fix for this though... tried this? http://askubuntu.com/questions/89932/flash-not-working-in-firefox
2012-08-24T00:21:00.000Z	trond-	newbzilla	should be the same approach.
2012-08-24T00:22:00.000Z	trond-	newbzilla	follow the directions on that page. Start with the apt-get purge command. This command will remove all files related to flash
2012-08-24T00:24:00.000Z	trond-	newbzilla	http://askubuntu.com/questions/108989/adobe-flash-not-working-in-firefox
2012-08-24T00:38:00.000Z	trond-	newbzilla	no progress in flash in firefox?
2012-08-24T00:40:00.000Z	trond-	newbzilla	don't think it has... did you get any information on any flash-alike plugins installed when running synaptics?
2012-08-24T00:42:00.000Z	trond-	newbzilla	let's start here: in Firefox - write about:plugins - See if you have flash there (should say something like shockwave)
2012-08-24T00:52:00.000Z	trond-	newbzilla	right. same as I have.
2012-08-24T00:53:00.000Z	trond-	newbzilla	what is the output of: update-alternatives --list mozilla-flashplugin
2012-08-24T00:53:00.000Z	trond-	newbzilla	on one line
2012-08-24T00:56:00.000Z	trond-	newbzilla	hm, same here...
2012-08-24T00:57:00.000Z	trond-	newbzilla	yup... I have the same path
2012-08-24T00:59:00.000Z	trond-	newbzilla	flash is not working on any sites? Have you been to adobe.com and tested it there?
2012-08-24T01:00:00.000Z	trond-	newbzilla	could you check if this site is working for you? http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/
2012-08-24T01:07:00.000Z	newbzilla	trond-	it loaded the page but there were no videos or errors either
