2009-06-12T10:30:00.000Z	miguel1057	Dev_u_pper	 after i put the key show me that i connected to the wireless network
2009-06-12T10:32:00.000Z	miguel1057	Dev_u_pper	 im not in that place where was the problem but i did it and it was giving to my card dhcp address i tryied with manual address too but it didnt work
2009-06-12T10:33:00.000Z	Dev_u_pper	miguel1057	: next time, check to see if you can correctly ping the gateway (usually 192.168.1.1 or something similar) - this is a good indicator if you are actually able to "talk" to the network you're trying to work with
2009-06-12T10:33:00.000Z	miguel1057	Dev_u_pper	 i couldnt i tryied
2009-06-12T10:35:00.000Z	miguel1057	Dev_u_pper	 i use wpa and wpa2 personal encryption i used it and i gots connected
2009-06-12T10:35:00.000Z	miguel1057	Dev_u_pper	 well i tryied from the same place from windows vista i said and it was working
2009-06-12T10:37:00.000Z	miguel1057	Dev_u_pper	 right know im working with my laptop and the same card but im in home and this wireless network dosnt have encryption it works good with ubuntu the problem was there with dsl and wpa wpa2 encryption
2009-06-12T10:38:00.000Z	Dev_u_pper	miguel1057	because you said that you successfully obtained an IP-address, it is safe to say that the card is working and that you were talking with the network.
2009-06-12T10:38:00.000Z	miguel1057	Dev_u_pper	 sure u then right but i could make ping to ip gateway hehe
2009-06-12T10:40:00.000Z	miguel1057	Dev_u_pper	 right i was getting and ip address and netmask and dns but i could make ping to 192.168.1.254 it is the gateway
2009-06-12T10:41:00.000Z	miguel1057	Dev_u_pper	 i tryied desabling and enabling the card and once i could make ping to the gatewat but only one packet the rest got lost

2009-06-12T10:47:00.000Z	miguel1057	Dev_u_pper	 i think this problem is about support on ubuntu with this card last versions of ubuntu were the same problem
