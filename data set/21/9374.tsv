2010-11-26T14:45:00.000Z	jita		I want to install ubuntu without the GUI in virtual environment under windows OS. Is it possible and what is the best possible way ?
2010-11-26T14:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jita	 install the server version in virtualbox.
2010-11-26T14:46:00.000Z	jita	Dr_Willis	Is there any disadvantage of doing it over separate install of ubuntu as a dual boot OS?
2010-11-26T14:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jita	 or install whatever version you want. and just disable GDM so X doswent start
2010-11-26T14:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jita	 virtualization will be slower.. but its trivial to do.
2010-11-26T14:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jita	 what work do you plan on doing in ubuntu exactly?
2010-11-26T14:47:00.000Z	jita	Dr_Willis	programming in python. i don't like linux GUI :(
2010-11-26T14:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jita	 like the gui really matters?     If you wanted to get fancy theres the (Not supported here) ubuntu variants like 'anlinux' that install inside windoww in a qemu (i think) virtual machine. that you dont see at all. You can just ssh to them, or run apps and they appear on the windows desktop via xming.
2010-11-26T14:50:00.000Z	jita	Dr_Willis	there's another option cygwin, what do you suggest ?
2010-11-26T14:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jita	 cygwin isent ubuntu either.. its also a bit old last time i used it.. why are you not just using python under windows?
2010-11-26T14:51:00.000Z	jita	Dr_Willis	i am used to linux environment, bash and all
2010-11-26T14:51:00.000Z	jita	Dr_Willis	i like coding that way
2010-11-26T14:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jita	 may as well just install ubuntu in virtualbox then - not like its going to take very long to setup..
2010-11-26T14:52:00.000Z	jita	Dr_Willis	right, i think thats the best possible solution, will give it a go, thanks for suggestion
2010-11-26T14:54:00.000Z	jita	Dr_Willis	I am going to download ubuntu, you think server edition will be a better go?
2010-11-26T14:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jita	 depends on your exact needs. I dont have any need for the server edition really vs desktop. Theres to many tools i use on the desktop edieion.
2010-11-26T14:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jita	 you can always disable gdm.  then ya got console only.
2010-11-26T14:55:00.000Z	jita	Dr_Willis	right, ty
2010-11-26T18:36:00.000Z	jita	Dr_Willis	there ?
2012-06-07T13:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jita	 depends on the details.. thisis linux.. verythings possible
2012-06-07T13:18:00.000Z	jita	Dr_Willis	I know shutter that can do, but i don't want to install new app for it
