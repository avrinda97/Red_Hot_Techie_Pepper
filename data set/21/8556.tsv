2009-02-13T19:50:00.000Z	jerndoe		hi, anybody know what the equivalent for gnome-session is in xubuntu?
2009-02-13T19:51:00.000Z	jerndoe		myrtti: there's not much activity in #xubuntu right now...

2009-02-13T19:52:00.000Z	Scunizi	jerndoe	or are you trying to stop the desktop?
2009-02-13T19:53:00.000Z	Scunizi	jerndoe	ah.. ssh -X <server@server>  the the name of a program.. unless you're getting a full x from the other machine
2009-02-13T19:55:00.000Z	Scunizi	jerndoe	yes.. that can also be a little different.. basically an ssh tunnel and then running VNC to get the full desktop to you.. there's another way I was reading about yesterday which invloves nesting X's but it's more difficult
2009-02-13T19:56:00.000Z	Scunizi	jerndoe	I think the vnc through ssh is what you're looking for.. vnc is built in
2009-02-13T19:57:00.000Z	Scunizi	jerndoe	on the gnome desktop under System>Preferences>Remote Desktop you can set it up.. not sure if the xubuntu desktop is the host
2009-02-13T20:02:00.000Z	Scunizi	jerndoe	what was the line you used?
2009-02-13T20:03:00.000Z	Scunizi	jerndoe	AH .. that's the magick part.. did you start it with /etc/init.d/xfce4-session start ?
2009-02-13T20:04:00.000Z	Scunizi	jerndoe	I'll have to try that.. right now I'm ssh'd into my server and running screen.. all cli stuff.. nice to use x once in a while
2009-02-13T20:05:00.000Z	Scunizi	jerndoe	it would be interesting to run screen before starting x ..
2009-02-13T20:07:00.000Z	Scunizi	jerndoe	screen is magick for the terminal.. when you ssh into a box you get a terminal prompt.. what if you wanted to do several things on that machine but only had one terminal prompt.. some would create another ssh session.. but it's not needed with screen .. it can create different "windows"
2009-02-13T20:08:00.000Z	Scunizi	jerndoe	brb.. I'm going to "disconnect" from screen and reconnect in a different way so I can try running X
2009-02-13T20:09:00.000Z	Scunizi	jerndoe	k.. I'm back.. screen lets you disconnect from a computer and reconnect later with all your stuff still running and accessable.
2009-02-13T20:10:00.000Z	Scunizi	jerndoe	looks like I didn't start this ssh session with the -X option.
2009-02-13T20:12:00.000Z	Scunizi	jerndoe	I've just started playing with ssh & screen.. so I have irssi running on the server for irc access from any machine in the housee and mutt for imap access to my gmail account all via cli and ssh and screen
2009-02-13T20:13:00.000Z	Scunizi	jerndoe	program..
2009-02-13T20:14:00.000Z	Scunizi	jerndoe	http://www.linuxdynasty.org/screen-howto-part-1.html  Here's another.. it's a very popular program
2009-02-13T20:22:00.000Z	Scunizi	jerndoe	np. :)
2009-02-13T20:23:00.000Z	Scunizi	jerndoe	took me a while to wrap my head around the concept.. really it was just "using" it that showed me how easy it really is.
