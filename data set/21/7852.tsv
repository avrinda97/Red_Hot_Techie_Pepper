2006-07-03T10:12:00.000Z	sys8976	oneeyedelf1	have you tried apt get yet?
2006-07-03T10:12:00.000Z	oneeyedelf1	sys8976	it isnt in apt
2006-07-03T10:12:00.000Z	oneeyedelf1		apt-cache search fspot returns nothing
2006-07-03T10:13:00.000Z	sys8976		[_miT_] : good to here welcome aboard
2006-07-03T10:13:00.000Z	sys8976	oneeyedelf1	let me look at that app one sec
2006-07-03T10:14:00.000Z	sys8976		F-Spot is in the Universe repository under the name "f-spot"
2006-07-03T10:15:00.000Z	sys8976	oneeyedelf1	you should be able to search for it in the spm app
2006-07-03T10:15:00.000Z	sys8976		Ex0r can you send me that error message again?
2006-07-03T10:16:00.000Z	oneeyedelf1	sys8976	spm = synaptic package manager? because if so fspot turns up nothing
2006-07-03T10:16:00.000Z	sys8976	oneeyedelf1	what version of ubuntu are you using?
2006-07-03T10:17:00.000Z	oneeyedelf1	sys8976	and f-spot also returns nothing
