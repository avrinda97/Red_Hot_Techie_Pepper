2008-11-22T08:05:00.000Z	unop	Windsurfer619	 ulimit
2008-11-22T08:06:00.000Z	Windsurfer619	unop	What do you mean?
2008-11-22T08:07:00.000Z	unop	Windsurfer619	http://www.ss64.com/bash/ulimit.html
2008-11-22T08:08:00.000Z	Windsurfer619	unop	"E: Couldn't find package ulimit"
2008-11-22T08:08:00.000Z	unop	Windsurfer619	that's because it is not available as a package - it's a shell builtin
2008-11-22T08:08:00.000Z	Windsurfer619	unop	Oh! I see!
2008-11-22T08:08:00.000Z	unop	Windsurfer619	 at a terminal.   help ulimit
2008-11-22T08:13:00.000Z	Windsurfer619	unop	So how would I go about limiting the nautilus process in Ubuntu?
2008-11-22T08:15:00.000Z	unop	Windsurfer619	 you set the appropriate limits in one of your startup files ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc  (but be careful, you need to allow sufficient resources or some apps will refuse to load or behave mysteriously)
2008-11-22T08:16:00.000Z	Windsurfer619	unop	Hm. That's almost what I want. But that would limit my total system resources, right? I just want to limit the "nautilus" process. My other apps are fine.
2008-11-22T08:18:00.000Z	unop	Windsurfer619	it would affect all apps that _you_ start (not those of the system) - if you want to set limits for nautilus, you might have to start nautilus using a sub-shell or a wrapper script i.e. a script in your ~/bin/  called nautilus that sets the limit and then calls /usr/bin/nautilus
2008-11-22T08:19:00.000Z	Windsurfer619	unop	Ah! That's a good idea. Thanks!
2008-11-22T08:19:00.000Z	unop	Windsurfer619	you'll have to ensure that ~/bin is in your PATH too tho
2008-11-22T08:19:00.000Z	Windsurfer619	unop	Can I not just move the normal /bin/nautilus to /bin/nautilus2, and put a script in it's old place?
2008-11-22T08:20:00.000Z	unop	Windsurfer619	you could, but I wouldn't if I were you - I prefer keeping things in standard locations
2008-11-22T08:21:00.000Z	Windsurfer619	unop	Okay :)
2008-11-22T08:21:00.000Z	unop	Windsurfer619	also, it defeats the point of keeping linux multi-user - other users wouldn't appreciate it
2008-11-22T08:21:00.000Z	Windsurfer619	unop	Okay. Though, this is my laptop...
2008-11-22T08:22:00.000Z	unop	Windsurfer619	extrapolate - if something should fail with your strategy, you can always log in as another user to rectify things, but if you make global changes - every user is affected and so you propgate the problem on.
2008-11-22T08:23:00.000Z	Windsurfer619	unop	Okay, I see. Nifty!
