2007-05-02T10:39:00.000Z	Nubbie	chrisULM	ctrl alt f2, login, run sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-05-02T10:41:00.000Z	chrisULM	Nubbie	press ctrl alt f2 @ the busybox promt?
2007-05-02T10:45:00.000Z	chrisULM	Nubbie	ctrl atl f2 does nothing
2007-05-02T10:45:00.000Z	Nubbie	chrisULM	did you see the grub screen?
2007-05-02T10:46:00.000Z	chrisULM	Nubbie	yes
2007-05-02T10:46:00.000Z	chrisULM	Nubbie	do ctrl alt f2 @ the grub screen?
2007-05-02T10:46:00.000Z	Nubbie	chrisULM	did grub load?
2007-05-02T10:47:00.000Z	Nubbie	chrisULM	and after that you get a busybox?
2007-05-02T10:47:00.000Z	Nubbie	chrisULM	did you mess around with your grub settings?
2007-05-02T10:47:00.000Z	Nubbie	chrisULM	do you still have your installation cd?
2007-05-02T10:47:00.000Z	chrisULM	Nubbie	no. i just installed a new gfx card. thats all
2007-05-02T10:48:00.000Z	Nubbie	chrisULM	have you tried booting in safe graphics mode?
2007-05-02T10:48:00.000Z	chrisULM	Nubbie	recovery mode right?
2007-05-02T10:48:00.000Z	Nubbie	chrisULM	yeah.
2007-05-02T10:48:00.000Z	Nubbie	chrisULM	if you can get in recovery mode, you can reconfigure xorg.
2007-05-02T10:49:00.000Z	chrisULM	Nubbie	looks like its gonna hang on "USB HID core driver"
2007-05-02T10:49:00.000Z	Nubbie	chrisULM	thats weird.
2007-05-02T10:52:00.000Z	chrisULM	Nubbie	yep booted to Busybox
2007-05-02T10:52:00.000Z	Nubbie	chrisULM	all you did was change your graphics card?
2007-05-02T10:52:00.000Z	chrisULM	Nubbie	that is all
