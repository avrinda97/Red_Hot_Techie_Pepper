2005-06-27T11:40:00.000Z	mhz		hi/hola
2005-06-27T11:41:00.000Z	mhz		i've just installed Ubuntu 5.04
2005-06-27T11:41:00.000Z	mhz		what plugins i need to play mp3 and dvd?
2005-06-27T11:42:00.000Z	nalioth	mhz	ubotu will tell you
2005-07-03T16:18:00.000Z	nalioth	mhz	what kind of ibook? mine runs o-o-t-b at 1024x768
2005-07-03T16:19:00.000Z	nalioth	mhz	that's weird, i have a dual-usb white iBook2 G3/600 and my rez defaulted to 1024x768
2005-07-03T16:19:00.000Z	nalioth	mhz	have you run the reconfigure thing?
2005-07-03T16:19:00.000Z	mhz	nalioth	yep, that was 1st thing
2005-07-03T16:20:00.000Z	nalioth	mhz	or added settings to your xorg.conf (or whatever it is)
2005-07-03T16:20:00.000Z	mhz	nalioth	yep, that was 2nd thing :)
2005-07-03T16:20:00.000Z	nalioth	mhz	i have a 3d guess. did you run the reconfigure thing and choose VESA as the driver?
2005-07-03T16:21:00.000Z	mhz	nalioth	that I have not done yet! THX for that 3r one .)
2005-07-03T16:21:00.000Z	nalioth	mhz	the VESA driver will run a dead skunk
2005-07-03T16:22:00.000Z	mhz	nalioth	"dead shunk" ?
2005-07-03T16:22:00.000Z	nalioth	mhz	all modern video cards (way back at least 4 years) are VESA compliant
2005-07-03T16:23:00.000Z	nalioth	mhz	so you can drag out that ancient cirrus card and VESA will run it
2005-07-03T16:26:00.000Z	mhz	nalioth	thx for the tip, I'll try it on wednesday (when I'll be in front of the machine)
2005-07-03T16:26:00.000Z	nalioth	mhz	np, i have 2 ibooks (and 0 other machines)
2005-07-03T16:27:00.000Z	mhz	nalioth	that's why, tehn!
2005-11-04T11:27:00.000Z	nalioth	mhz	if uncle google doesnt know, doubtful we will
2005-11-04T11:28:00.000Z	mhz	nalioth	good argument
