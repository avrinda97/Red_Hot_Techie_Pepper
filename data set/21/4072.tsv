2009-03-25T20:11:00.000Z	linfenix		hello, someone knows a tool to decrypt files (specifically images) or any known method how to do it?
2009-03-25T20:12:00.000Z	UbuntuX	linfenix	it depends on what program your file was originally encrypted.
2009-03-25T20:13:00.000Z	linfenix		thats the point, i don't know with wich program was encrypted
2009-03-25T20:13:00.000Z	UbuntuX	linfenix	what extention name is followed by your filename?
2009-03-25T20:14:00.000Z	linfenix		wait, let me check
2009-03-25T20:14:00.000Z	linfenix	UbuntuX	its JPG
2009-03-25T20:16:00.000Z	UbuntuX	linfenix	can you be sure the JPG has been encrypted? If the file is downloaded, chances are it is broken, you are not able to open it either.
2009-03-25T20:17:00.000Z	linfenix		yeah, im sure, but i think the file its a leter broken too
2009-03-25T20:18:00.000Z	linfenix	UbuntuX	anyway, can i fix it or decrypt ?
2009-03-25T20:19:00.000Z	UbuntuX	linfenix	if the file is broken after it got encrypted, chances are you may not be able to decrypt it. try to use 'gpg' to verify what algorithm it was used, if the file indeed has been encrypted.
2009-03-25T20:20:00.000Z	linfenix		what gpg means?
2009-03-25T20:21:00.000Z	linfenix		its an aplication?
2009-03-25T20:22:00.000Z	UbuntuX		'gpg' is a common tool for encryption/decryption purposes and it is included in almost all linux ditributions. open your terminal and type: gpg --version

2009-03-25T20:30:00.000Z	linfenix		UbutuX: i do this and give me this message; linfenix@linfenix-laptop:~/Desktop$ gpg 000000058652.JPG gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found pg: processing message failed: eo
2009-03-25T20:30:00.000Z	linfenix		eof
2009-03-25T20:33:00.000Z	UbuntuX	linfenix	the file is either broken or encrypted and wrapped by a specific program.
2009-03-25T20:35:00.000Z	linfenix	UbuntuX	humm.. so can't do anything?
2009-03-25T20:38:00.000Z	linfenix	UbuntuX	humm.. so i can't do anything?
