2007-04-05T06:26:00.000Z	smileboot	cowbud	i agree at the moment
2007-04-05T06:27:00.000Z	cowbud	smileboot	it probably just hates your hardware
2007-04-05T06:27:00.000Z	smileboot	cowbud	maybe
2007-04-05T06:29:00.000Z	cowbud	smileboot	there can be a million reasons why, that's one of the risks
2007-04-05T06:30:00.000Z	cowbud	smileboot	do you have a thumb drive and can your old hardware boot to thumb drives?
2007-04-05T06:32:00.000Z	cowbud	smileboot	have you tried the non-livecd install?
2007-04-05T06:33:00.000Z	cowbud	smileboot	yep trying or you've tried it?
2007-04-05T06:33:00.000Z	cowbud	smileboot	and it just hangs or what?
2007-04-05T06:35:00.000Z	cowbud	smileboot	have you tried with the noacpi option?
2007-04-05T06:43:00.000Z	cowbud	smileboot	sometimes hardware doesn't work it looks like you tried everything I would have

2007-04-05T06:45:00.000Z	cowbud	smileboot	when you boot does it have the boot screen?
2007-04-05T06:46:00.000Z	cowbud	smileboot	when you are booting do you see a Ubuntu logo and just a progress bar and it hangs that way or do you see a bunch of text?

2007-04-05T06:46:00.000Z	cowbud	smileboot	well I am talking about the alternative cd..
2007-04-05T06:46:00.000Z	cowbud	smileboot	I wouldn't even try the livecd with 192megs of ram
2007-04-05T06:48:00.000Z	cowbud	smileboot	boot up and when it has the option to select the install hit e to edit the boot then go to the second line and hit e again and remove splash and quiet and then hit b to boot and see where it hangs
