2004-11-07T16:44:00.000Z	altan		what's the parameter to have a terminal program run in the background, like wvdial?
2004-11-07T16:46:00.000Z	altan		thanks
2004-11-07T16:46:00.000Z	altan		do I upgrade my stuff with Synaptic?
2004-11-07T16:46:00.000Z	altan		*update
2004-11-07T16:46:00.000Z	stvn	altan	press the reload button
2004-11-07T16:47:00.000Z	stvn	altan	than, mark upgrades and apply
2004-11-07T16:48:00.000Z	stvn	altan	smart upgrade upgrades everything you have and the packages you need with that upgrade, nothing more, nothing less
2004-11-07T16:54:00.000Z	stvn	altan	check the version, it's something complicated here: 0.99+1.0PR+revertedto0.9.3
2004-11-07T16:54:00.000Z	stvn	altan	I guess it means that you have 09.3 with quite some features from .99 and 1
2004-11-07T07:04:00.000Z	stvn	altan	tried /dev/sda5 instead of /dev/sda2 if it's an extended partition it could very well be /sda5
2004-11-08T17:09:00.000Z	stvn	altan	remove the high resolutions from the XF86Config-4 file
2004-11-08T17:09:00.000Z	stvn	altan	need to restart X
2004-11-08T17:09:00.000Z	stvn	altan	not enough ;)
2004-11-12T07:35:00.000Z	stvn	altan	only on debian i guess
2004-11-12T07:41:00.000Z	stvn	altan	being a former RISC OS user I can appreciate ROX-filer, but nautilus works just fine for me now
2004-11-12T07:42:00.000Z	altan	stvn	I'm in a GNOME-free environment at the moment
2004-11-12T07:43:00.000Z	stvn	altan	you still can run nautilus there ;) but i get your point, mc is nice as well ;)
2004-11-12T07:44:00.000Z	stvn	altan	there is also gmc
2004-11-12T07:44:00.000Z	stvn	altan	dunno if it does AA
2004-11-12T07:44:00.000Z	altan	stvn	not listed on Synaptic :(
2004-11-12T08:02:00.000Z	stvn	altan	kopete?
