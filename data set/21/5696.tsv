2007-09-13T11:52:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Evanlec	KompoZer is NOT a KDE app - the naming has nothing to do with KDE
2007-09-13T11:52:00.000Z	Evanlec	tonyyarusso	yes im aware, and if u read that far back i corrected myself ;)
2007-09-13T11:52:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Evanlec	heh, just got that far in the awaylog :S
2007-09-19T09:44:00.000Z	Evanlec	tonyyarusso	lol u got ur own repo ;p
2007-09-19T09:44:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Evanlec	yeah, it's a new Launchpad feature being tested
2007-09-19T09:47:00.000Z	Evanlec	tonyyarusso	launchpad is the bug-filing system for ubuntu right?
2007-09-19T09:47:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Evanlec	among other things, yes.
2007-09-19T09:48:00.000Z	Evanlec	tonyyarusso	what is it your hosting on your repo, whats it for?
2007-09-19T09:50:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Evanlec	It's the Nvu replacement, packaged for edgy and feisty until we can get it in backports.
2007-09-19T09:50:00.000Z	Evanlec	tonyyarusso	but what does that have to do with launchpad?
2007-09-19T09:50:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Evanlec	it's a place to host the package
2007-09-19T10:30:00.000Z	Evanlec	tonyyarusso	what for?
2007-09-19T10:30:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Evanlec	It makes things more sane when you have the stable and development version on the same machine, for instance.
2007-09-19T10:31:00.000Z	Evanlec	tonyyarusso	what goes in this boot partition? grub? how does your bios know to use that partition?
2007-09-19T10:31:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Evanlec	the grub config files, yes, and grub-install goes on the MBR with a pointer to it for the bios
2007-09-19T10:32:00.000Z	Evanlec	tonyyarusso	i see...so the MBR is sorta like its own little partition on the first sector of the disk?
2007-09-19T10:32:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Evanlec	yeah, it's the first 512 bytes iirc
2007-09-19T10:33:00.000Z	Evanlec	tonyyarusso	alright, makes a little more sense to me now, so grub overwrites that space with a pointer to the /boot partition
2007-09-19T10:34:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Evanlec	yup
2007-09-19T10:35:00.000Z	Evanlec	tonyyarusso	but lets say in a dual-boot environment with windows, that point would still go to the /boot partition but inside that partition would be the config files that would let u then boot from another partition to windows for example?
2007-09-19T10:36:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Evanlec	Yeah - !dualboot has more info on that.  Windows would just be another entry like anything else, plus the chainloader +1 option
