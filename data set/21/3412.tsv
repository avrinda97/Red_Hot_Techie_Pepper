2010-08-08T08:14:00.000Z	c4pt		hello i seem to be having a problem. i built a custom kernel from xen pvops sources. the problem seems to be now that i have enabled nouveau patches into the kernel image and built the kernel image + headers i cant seem to rebuild nouveau.ko in /usr/lib/modules/pvops.2.6 .......
2010-08-08T08:14:00.000Z	c4pt		.....even though nouveau.ko is in /usr/lib/modules/generic-2.6
2010-08-08T08:14:00.000Z	c4pt		because i didnt build nouveau.ko in make menuconfig as a module or into the kernel
2010-08-08T08:15:00.000Z	c4pt		is there a way i can just simply rebuild nouveau.ko for pvops.2.6 without having to recompile the entire kernel and rebuild?
2010-08-08T08:17:00.000Z	sacarlson	c4pt	as far as I know as long as the source in a link hasn't changed it won't recompile that part unless you do a make clean
2010-08-08T08:17:00.000Z	c4pt	sacarlson	that seems to make sense all of a sudden i did an rm -rf linux-2.6 and then git checkout but not a make clean.
2010-08-08T08:18:00.000Z	c4pt	sacarlson	it was odd because when i ran make (without menuconfig or oldconfig figuring the changes took effect it didnt even prompt me as usual)
2010-08-08T08:18:00.000Z	sacarlson	c4pt	you might be able to just change the config enable the new stuf and compile. it will find the change and compile and link it
2010-08-08T08:18:00.000Z	c4pt	sacarlson	so rm -rf linux-2.6/ then git checkout then cp -rf config then make clean? (should prompt me with a yes or no (single question) the way i have the config set as of current
2010-08-08T08:19:00.000Z	c4pt	sacarlson	as of current...it did a single yes or no when i ran make it didnt do it the second time after i didnt run make clean.
2010-08-08T08:20:00.000Z	c4pt	sacarlson	so if i presently run make clean it will make the new options hopefully?
2010-08-08T08:20:00.000Z	sacarlson	c4pt	 oh I'm not sure I think you might need to go into the config editor and turn it on also
2010-08-08T08:20:00.000Z	c4pt	sacarlson	ok thanx i will give it another try if i am back in like 2 or 3 hours it will probably be because i cant see it in menuconfig or something.
2010-08-08T08:21:00.000Z	c4pt	sacarlson	yeah but i am not sure what to enable to make nouveau show up in the options of make menuconfig
2010-08-08T08:21:00.000Z	sacarlson	c4pt	nouveau is the for nvidia?
2010-08-08T08:22:00.000Z	c4pt	sacarlson	yeah.
2010-08-08T08:22:00.000Z	sacarlson	c4pt	I think I recall seeing nvidia support in menuconfig
2010-08-08T08:40:00.000Z	c4pt	sacarlson	i figured out why the option wasnt available i had to git remote add the driver source (as in the nouveau wiki) to /usr/src/pvops.2.6/    then menuconfig then enable it as <m> then make clean
2010-08-08T08:40:00.000Z	c4pt	sacarlson	thanx
2010-08-09T15:48:00.000Z	c4pt	sacarlson	was i talking to you the other day?
2010-08-09T15:48:00.000Z	c4pt	sacarlson	about nouveau in a custom kernel?
