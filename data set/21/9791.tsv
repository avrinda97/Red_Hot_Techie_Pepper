2005-07-14T08:35:00.000Z	hosler		I need the 2.6.10 kernel source but synaptic doesnt have it in its database, where can i get the ubunti 2.6.10 kernel source.
2005-07-14T08:35:00.000Z	bddebian	hosler	Hoary?
2005-07-14T08:36:00.000Z	hosler	bddebian	i have all the repositories in allready.
2005-07-14T08:37:00.000Z	bddebian	hosler	OK but I was asking what you are running.  You aren't on Warty are you?
2005-07-14T08:37:00.000Z	hosler	bddebian	I dont know waht warty is, so I dont think so.
2005-07-14T08:39:00.000Z	bddebian	hosler	From a terminal try this: "apt-cache dump |grep kernel-tree-2.6"
2005-07-14T08:40:00.000Z	hosler	bddebian	I did that and didnt get any output response.
2005-07-14T08:40:00.000Z	bddebian	hosler	Sorry, that should be "kernel-source-2.6"
2005-07-14T08:41:00.000Z	hosler	bddebian	Package: kernel-source-2.6.1
2005-07-14T08:41:00.000Z	bddebian	hosler	Please don't post in here :-)
2005-07-14T08:44:00.000Z	bddebian	hosler	Are you sure you aren't running Warty?
2005-07-14T08:46:00.000Z	hosler	bddebian	im running the Hoary Hedgehog release
2005-07-14T08:46:00.000Z	bddebian	hosler	That is strange, you should at least have 2.6.10
2005-07-14T08:46:00.000Z	bddebian	hosler	If you do "uname -i" what kernel version are you running currently?
2005-07-14T08:47:00.000Z	hosler	bddebian	2.6.10-5-386
2005-07-14T08:48:00.000Z	bddebian	hosler	Then you have to be able to get the source.
2005-07-14T08:48:00.000Z	hosler	bddebian	I looked all over synaptic. Can i get it off of the ubuntu website?
2005-07-14T08:49:00.000Z	bddebian	hosler	Have you done an update?
2005-07-14T08:49:00.000Z	hosler	bddebian	yeah
2005-07-14T08:57:00.000Z	bddebian	hosler	Did you find the source?
2005-07-14T08:57:00.000Z	hosler	bddebian	nope :(
