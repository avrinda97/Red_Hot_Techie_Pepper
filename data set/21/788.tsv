2011-06-12T16:54:00.000Z	mediawork		hi,
2011-06-12T16:54:00.000Z	mediawork		is anyone here quite familiar with how lm-sensors works?
2011-06-12T16:55:00.000Z	mediawork		I installed this on my ubuntu, to get temperature readings from the cpu and motherboard
2011-06-12T16:55:00.000Z	mediawork		and I am getting non-sensical temp readings... and temp changes... I think
2011-06-12T16:56:00.000Z	mediawork		unless, any part of an amd phenom processor/motherboard should go over 120 deg C
2011-06-12T16:57:00.000Z	xgt001	mediawork	did you try sensor-detect after installing lm-sensors>
2011-06-12T16:58:00.000Z	mediawork	xgt001	yes, according to instructions i did the sensor detect...
2011-06-12T16:59:00.000Z	xgt001	mediawork	if you use the gnome applets then the values are not updated very frequently
2011-06-12T16:59:00.000Z	mediawork	xgt001	  the gnome applet I am using fetches the values from lm-sensors
2011-06-12T17:01:00.000Z	mediawork	xgt001	I get the same values,  but if I run from the terminal I simply get the value when I want it.
2011-06-12T17:02:00.000Z	xgt001	mediawork	apologies,... could you tell me your specs?
2011-06-12T17:04:00.000Z	mediawork	xgt001	my specs, are MB is  GA-880GM-D2H   and CPU is  AMD Phenom II X4 965
2011-06-12T17:05:00.000Z	xgt001	mediawork	what's the critical temperature shown by sensors ??
2011-06-12T17:06:00.000Z	mediawork	xgt001	 here is a typical readout of sensors (when my PC is doing nothing)  http://pastebin.com/Thk93Ybg
2011-06-12T17:06:00.000Z	mediawork	xgt001	 it seems it didnt config the critical temperature correctly, I think.
2011-06-12T17:06:00.000Z	mediawork	xgt001	and it didnt label the 4 different temp sensors with a name that is understandable...
2011-06-12T17:06:00.000Z	mediawork	xgt001	 its only temp1 temp2 temp3 ...
2011-06-12T17:08:00.000Z	mediawork	xgt001	ehm no, I think 10.1 or smthng. wait
2011-06-12T17:10:00.000Z	xgt001	mediawork	I think it's a bug with sensors
2011-06-12T17:10:00.000Z	xgt001	mediawork	I mean the lm-sensors :) .... I think the sensors in 10.10 is buggy
2011-06-12T17:11:00.000Z	mediawork	xgt001	rly:  is there an easy way to update only the lm-sensor library?  not the whole ubuntu?
