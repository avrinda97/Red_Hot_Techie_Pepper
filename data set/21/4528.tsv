2008-07-11T03:06:00.000Z	Swish		I see that fsck for ext3 has a "preen" feature but it doesn't seem to do anything
2008-07-11T03:06:00.000Z	Swish		so touch /forcefsck does no significant defragging
2008-07-11T03:07:00.000Z	Gnea	Swish	fsck does not defrag
2008-07-11T03:10:00.000Z	Gnea	Swish	but... ext3 doesn't defrag
2008-07-11T03:10:00.000Z	Gnea	Swish	it gets fsck'd, but not defragged
2008-07-11T03:10:00.000Z	Swish	Gnea	that's too bad because this ext3 is definitely fragmented
2008-07-11T03:11:00.000Z	Gnea	Swish	perhaps you should look into the source a bit more and figure out how the filesystems really operate. you could simply press the power button and force the system to turn off, that would turn the fsck on at boot.
2008-07-11T03:15:00.000Z	Gnea	Swish	yes, well, when you've used something for well over a decade, you tend to know what you're talking about ;)
2008-07-11T03:16:00.000Z	Swish	Gnea	length of time doesn't seem to have much to do with it.  I've met some very competant people who haven't used a system for very long, and some real boneheads who've used it for decades ;)
2008-07-11T03:21:00.000Z	Gnea	Swish	and btw: http://www.howforge.com/how-force-fsck-ubuntu
2008-07-11T03:22:00.000Z	Swish	Gnea	both work.  but the shutdown method was broken in 6.1 so I didn't want to chance it with Hardy
2008-07-11T03:22:00.000Z	Gnea	Swish	ah
2008-07-11T03:22:00.000Z	Swish	Gnea	sorry you feel so injured about the "insulting remark", no offense was intended :)
2008-07-11T03:23:00.000Z	Gnea	Swish	not injured in the slightest, thank you for addressing the issue :)
2008-07-11T03:26:00.000Z	Gnea	Swish	heh, ntfs > reiser
2008-07-11T03:27:00.000Z	Swish	Gnea	yeah, I'd consider NTFS > ext3 too, but I might meet some resistence there :D
2008-07-11T03:27:00.000Z	Gnea	Swish	NTFS cannot translate EXT3, but EXT3 can translate NTFS, therefore EXT3 > NTFS in my book :)
2008-07-11T03:28:00.000Z	Gnea	Swish	but Samba can be pretty reliable at times ;)
2008-07-11T03:29:00.000Z	Gnea	Swish	let me let you in on a little secret about this channel: stick to the facts, keep your opinion out of it, and don't be insulting. you'll live longer, k? :)
2008-07-11T03:29:00.000Z	Swish	Gnea	thanks, and I know the rules ;)  I've been on IRC over a decade too ;)
2008-07-11T03:30:00.000Z	Gnea	Swish	thanks, and you are now on /ignore
