2008-12-12T23:17:00.000Z	|Kamen|		I am having issues with XawTV. when I start it, it gives me a black screen which I cannot task switch out of
2008-12-12T23:18:00.000Z	Gnea	|Kamen|	did you point it at the correct video device?
2008-12-12T23:18:00.000Z	|Kamen|	Gnea	I have no idea how. I cant do a thing once it starts up and blacks out my screen
2008-12-12T23:19:00.000Z	Gnea	|Kamen|	can you right-click on it to get a menu?
2008-12-12T23:19:00.000Z	Gnea	|Kamen|	k, did you start it from the menu or terminal?
2008-12-12T23:20:00.000Z	Gnea	|Kamen|	okay, try this them: go Applications->Accessories->Terminal  and in that terminal, type this:  killall xawtv
2008-12-12T23:21:00.000Z	Gnea	|Kamen|	what about ctrl-alt-F1?
2008-12-12T23:21:00.000Z	Gnea	|Kamen|	you should be able to get back to it with ctrl-alt-f7
2008-12-12T23:22:00.000Z	Gnea	|Kamen|	alt-f4 is probably responsible for that, ctrl-alt-f4 should take you out of X
2008-12-12T23:24:00.000Z	Gnea	|Kamen|	what tv card do you have?
2008-12-12T23:24:00.000Z	Gnea	|Kamen|	what does lspci have to say about it?
2008-12-12T23:26:00.000Z	Gnea	|Kamen|	xawtv is rather primitive
2008-12-12T23:37:00.000Z	Gnea	|Kamen|	try it from a terminal, it will tell you why
2008-12-12T23:40:00.000Z	Gnea	|Kamen|	hrm, try tvtime -h
2008-12-12T23:40:00.000Z	Gnea	|Kamen|	you should get a bunch of options, should be one there for 'device'
2008-12-12T23:44:00.000Z	Gnea	|Kamen|	are you sure it's the correct /dev?
2008-12-12T23:51:00.000Z	Gnea	|Kamen|	sounds like it should work just fine... do you have your coax hooked up?
2008-12-12T23:53:00.000Z	Gnea	|Kamen|	composite?
2008-12-12T23:55:00.000Z	Gnea	|Kamen|	yeah, RCA plugs into the Composite (i know, i have the same card. ;) )
2008-12-12T23:56:00.000Z	Gnea	|Kamen|	er, shouldn't need to edit xorg.conf, but i'm not too familiar with fglrx..
