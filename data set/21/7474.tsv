2006-12-02T12:02:00.000Z	arash		im making a makefile for a school assignment. how do i prevent anything being sent to standard output?
2006-12-02T12:02:00.000Z	arash		is that the only way?
2006-12-02T12:03:00.000Z	arash		and will EVERY unix machine have /dev/hull?
2006-12-02T12:04:00.000Z	ArrenLex	arash	Every POSIX-compliant OS will have /dev/null
2006-12-02T12:08:00.000Z	ArrenLex	arash	what command are you trying to run?
2006-12-02T12:09:00.000Z	arash	ArrenLex	i am compiling a java class javac -classpath $(PATHH) -Xlint $<
2006-12-02T12:09:00.000Z	ArrenLex	arash	and where is the /dev/null coming from?
2006-12-02T12:09:00.000Z	ArrenLex	arash	 javac -classpath $(PATHH) -Xlint $< >> /dev/null
2006-12-02T12:10:00.000Z	ArrenLex	arash	shouldn't matter.
2006-12-02T12:10:00.000Z	ArrenLex	arash	there is no last slash on that.
2006-12-02T12:11:00.000Z	ArrenLex	arash	what's the output of "file /dev/null"
2006-12-02T12:11:00.000Z	ArrenLex	arash	you ARE running Linux, yes? o__O
2006-12-02T12:12:00.000Z	ArrenLex	arash	that's different! Which is it?!
2006-12-02T12:12:00.000Z	ArrenLex	arash	what's the output of    echo "foobar" > /dev/null
2006-12-02T12:13:00.000Z	ArrenLex	arash	Good. Now what's the output of your command with > /dev/null
2006-12-02T12:15:00.000Z	arash	ArrenLex	it still outputs to the screen
2006-12-02T12:15:00.000Z	ArrenLex	arash	what about 2> /dev/null
2006-12-02T12:16:00.000Z	ArrenLex	arash	> means "standard output". 2> means "error output"
2006-12-02T12:16:00.000Z	ArrenLex	arash	the compiler was printing those warnings to standard error rather than standard out
2006-12-02T12:17:00.000Z	ArrenLex	arash	many people on here are! Everyone has to start somewhere :)
2006-12-02T12:17:00.000Z	ArrenLex	arash	why don't you write code that doesn't generate warnings? :)
