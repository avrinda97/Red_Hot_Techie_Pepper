2007-07-27T12:07:00.000Z	Crescendo		If I install the ATI proprietary graphics drivers, is there a chance that will help my audio and wireless issues, too?
2007-07-27T12:07:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Crescendo	extremely unlikely.
2007-07-27T12:07:00.000Z	Crescendo	IndyGunFreak	didn't think so, lol.
2007-07-27T12:10:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Crescendo	try googling them with "Ubuntu 7.04 help" or something like that
2007-07-27T12:11:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Crescendo	whats your audio chipset?

2007-07-27T12:14:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Crescendo	no prob.
2007-07-27T12:14:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Crescendo	with wireless, you might just have to wing it, and work on it after the install is done
2007-07-27T12:15:00.000Z	Crescendo	IndyGunFreak	I might, but that's a last resort, I told her I'd have this up and running before she got home from work. :X
2007-07-27T12:16:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Crescendo	what type of wireless device does lspci identify it as?

2007-07-27T12:19:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Crescendo	i was just googling, saw one post said it should work
2007-07-27T12:20:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Crescendo	is that a wireless PCI card?
2007-07-27T12:21:00.000Z	Crescendo	IndyGunFreak	nope, it's built in to the laptop
2007-07-27T12:21:00.000Z	Crescendo	IndyGunFreak	found this in my /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist:  # buggy driver causes kernel BUG on load (Ubuntu: #78255, #88430)
2007-07-27T12:22:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Crescendo	i know very little about wireless, so i'm not sure.
2007-07-27T12:22:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Crescendo	wel,l unblack list it, you're on tyhe live CD, so it shouldn't be to big a deal, worst that happens is you restart
2007-07-27T12:23:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Crescendo	ndiswrapper should do the trick
