2009-09-16T15:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rtyu	i suugest you contact sophos
2009-09-16T15:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rtyu	its not an ubuntu issue as it is OS independant. If the software was an ubuntu software it is supported here
2009-09-16T15:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rtyu	but its not so is offtopic
2009-09-16T15:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rtyu	safeguard easy is nothing to do with ubuntu so is offtopic
2009-09-16T15:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rtyu	but you cant access anything, even the windows boot
2009-09-16T15:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rtyu	the software isnt supported here. I suggest you call the helpline
2009-09-16T15:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rtyu	yes, as your system is booting from the CD, not the harddrive which has this unsupported encryption on it
2009-09-16T15:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rtyu	call the helpline, its not supported here
