2005-05-29T15:53:00.000Z	Curlydave		2 instances of gaim, irc, a terminal window etc
2005-05-29T15:53:00.000Z	g14	Curlydave	You must have saved your session and it got all crazy
2005-05-29T15:57:00.000Z	Curlydave	g14	so if I exit all and unsave it, I"m good?
2005-05-29T15:57:00.000Z	g14	Curlydave	System -> Preferences -> Session
2005-05-31T06:01:00.000Z	g14	Curlydave	In windows, all kinds of stuff is open waiting for people to break into your computer
2005-05-31T06:01:00.000Z	g14	Curlydave	sudo gedit /etc/sudoers
2005-05-31T06:02:00.000Z	Curlydave	g14	what is this file?
2005-05-31T06:02:00.000Z	g14	Curlydave	Change %admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL to %admin  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL then you don't have to type a password to use sudo
2005-05-31T06:02:00.000Z	Curlydave	g14	if this works, i love you
2005-05-31T06:03:00.000Z	g14	Curlydave	I've got something even better if you are too lazy to type sudo all the time
2005-05-31T06:03:00.000Z	g14	Curlydave	And use the terminal alot (I do)
2005-05-31T06:03:00.000Z	Curlydave	g14	ty
2005-05-31T06:04:00.000Z	g14	Curlydave	Open up your ~/.bashrc and add alias commands to anything you want to always run as root
2005-05-31T06:04:00.000Z	Curlydave	g14	nice
2005-05-31T06:04:00.000Z	g14	Curlydave	Example: alias apt-get="sudo /usr/bin/apt-get"
2005-05-31T06:05:00.000Z	g14	Curlydave	You need to put the full path of each command and you can figure that out with which. Example: which apt-get
2005-05-31T06:06:00.000Z	g14	Curlydave	It keeps dumb users from breaking it
2005-05-31T06:07:00.000Z	g14	Curlydave	Well you haven't gotten hit with one of the worms that scans windows. You are lucky
