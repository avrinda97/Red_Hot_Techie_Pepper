2012-06-19T07:33:00.000Z	sacarlson	tomatosalad	does vitualbox  run on your apple?  maybe an option is to run ubuntu on your apple in virtualbox
2012-06-19T07:33:00.000Z	sacarlson	tomatosalad	ok I had to ask
2012-06-19T08:52:00.000Z	sacarlson	tomatosalad	most drivers are in the kernel,  you can get the package of a kernel offline,  or there are packages for sta drivers of some devices again can get offline deb and install from usb
2012-06-19T08:53:00.000Z	sacarlson	tomatosalad	did you try wicd?
2012-06-19T08:54:00.000Z	tomatosalad	sacarlson	it's not installed...
2012-06-19T08:55:00.000Z	sacarlson	tomatosalad	from your online computer sudo apt-get install apt-offline
2012-06-19T08:55:00.000Z	tomatosalad	sacarlson	online computer is a mac
2012-06-19T08:55:00.000Z	sacarlson	tomatosalad	for details see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingSoftware
2012-06-19T08:57:00.000Z	sacarlson	tomatosalad	oh bcm4331 I think there is an sta package for that but I could be wrong broadcom is the worst supported wifi device
2012-06-19T08:59:00.000Z	sacarlson	tomatosalad	oh and is this ubuntu running on an apple also?
2012-06-19T09:07:00.000Z	sacarlson	tomatosalad	I looked at the dependancies of b43-fwcutter and I don't think I see anything else that isn't already installed so just get that deb file from you mac from a browser link and put in on usb flash
2012-06-19T09:27:00.000Z	sacarlson	tomatosalad	install them?
2012-06-19T09:27:00.000Z	sacarlson	tomatosalad	double click in nautilus
