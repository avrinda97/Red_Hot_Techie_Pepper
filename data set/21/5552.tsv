2008-08-01T02:10:00.000Z	ljpp		Hi, just dropped in to say that the Ubuntu Hardy WLAN is useless on T41 thinkpads (and the whole series I beleive) due to change in wireless drivers
2008-08-01T02:11:00.000Z	ikonia	ljpp	thanks for sharing that
2008-08-01T02:11:00.000Z	ikonia	ljpp	bye
2008-08-01T02:11:00.000Z	ljpp	ikonia	really - WLAN has became very unreliable
2008-08-01T02:11:00.000Z	ikonia	ljpp	ok - bye
2008-08-01T02:11:00.000Z	ikonia	ljpp	or do you have a problem you want to discuss rather than just rant
2008-08-01T02:12:00.000Z	ikonia	ljpp	no you don't. If you want to chat about it, lets discuss it, if you want to rant "hi just dropped in to say ubuntu on a T41 sucks" don't bother
2008-08-01T02:13:00.000Z	ljpp	ikonia	and otherwise Ubuntu on a T41 pretty much ruulz
2008-08-01T02:14:00.000Z	ljpp	ikonia	pretty damn crazy to ship borked drivers for the LTS release
2008-08-01T02:14:00.000Z	ikonia	ljpp	they are not "borked" your having an issue
2008-08-01T02:14:00.000Z	ljpp	ikonia	actually it is - reports are flooding

2008-08-01T02:15:00.000Z	ikonia	ljpp	can you show me a bug report for these flooding in reports
2008-08-01T02:15:00.000Z	ikonia	ljpp	please show me a bug report
