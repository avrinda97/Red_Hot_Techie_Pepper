2006-04-19T12:00:00.000Z	bliss1__	roryy	how's is it going well i hope
2006-04-19T12:01:00.000Z	roryy	bliss1__	doing fine thanks, how are you?
2006-04-19T12:02:00.000Z	bliss1__	roryy	i have this  thread from ubuntu from feb 06 I want to know how to reply to it as I have the same problem http://www.ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-85379.html
2006-04-19T12:04:00.000Z	roryy	bliss1__	unfortunately I can't suggest anything other than the noacpi and nolapic boot options
2006-04-19T12:05:00.000Z	roryy	bliss1__	are you asking about how to use ubuntuforums ?
2006-04-19T12:07:00.000Z	roryy	bliss1__	i'm not very familiar with ubuntuforums; I'd suggest starting a new thread, or finding a more recent one.  You can paste a link to this older thread in the new one.  This looks like a good place to start: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=102
2006-04-19T12:08:00.000Z	bliss1__	roryy	 thanks for the ubuntu  forum answer how to place noacpi and nilapic at boot please and if apm is not  on my system
2006-04-19T12:09:00.000Z	roryy	bliss1__	oh, i see, sorry. just a sec
2006-04-19T12:10:00.000Z	roryy	bliss1__	it involves editing the file /boot/grub/menu.lst; you'll need root privileges to do that (do something like 'sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst')
2006-04-19T12:11:00.000Z	roryy	bliss1__	around line 60 or so you should see '# kopt=root=/dev/...'
2006-04-19T12:11:00.000Z	bliss1__	roryy	ok I am in there now but please bear in mind that i have apci but not apm
2006-04-19T12:13:00.000Z	roryy	bliss1__	it's acpi, not apci. Also, note that the spelling of the two options is different, but confusingly similar: noacpi and nolapic
2006-04-19T12:15:00.000Z	roryy	bliss1__	i cannot help you with hardware specific issues; laptop power is well beyond my ken. I *can* help you set your system up so that linux does not use ACPI or the LAPIC
2006-04-19T12:18:00.000Z	roryy	bliss1__	i'm not sure, sorry.
2006-04-19T12:20:00.000Z	roryy	bliss1__	It's very easy to disable these two things -- just two kernel parameters in /boot/grub/menu.lst; I'm not sure what is used instead (if anything) in that case
2006-04-19T12:27:00.000Z	roryy	bliss1__	sorry, missed that last bit
2006-04-19T12:27:00.000Z	roryy	bliss1__	the latter one is the one you want to edit (the one with only one #)
2006-04-19T12:27:00.000Z	bliss1__	roryy	ok  lets at least try i can thses two lines in mennu.lst   ## e.g. kopt=root=/dev/hda1 ro   and # kopt=root=/dev/hda2 ro
2006-04-19T12:28:00.000Z	roryy	bliss1__	turn that into '# kopt=root=/dev/hda2 ro noacpi nolapic'
2006-04-19T12:28:00.000Z	roryy	bliss1__	then run 'sudo update-grub' and reboot
2006-04-19T12:29:00.000Z	roryy	bliss1__	if this doesn't work, i guess it would be wise to remove those two options
