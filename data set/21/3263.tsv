2009-02-23T21:58:00.000Z	freegoo		hey guys trying to change the file permitions using chmod "sudo chmod -vR a+rwxrwxrwx /media/P/Documents". i dont get any errors in the terminal. but if i do "ls -l /media/P/Documents" the file permitions have not changed any ideas ???
2009-02-23T21:59:00.000Z	sipior	freegoo	just "a+rwx" will do
2009-02-23T22:00:00.000Z	freegoo	sipior	but i need to copy these files onto a fat32 partition. if i use the in win or osx i will not have full parmition
2009-02-23T22:01:00.000Z	sipior	freegoo	"a" stands for "all", as opposed to "u", "g" or "o" :-)
2009-02-23T22:20:00.000Z	freegoo	sipior	i tryed "a+rwx" and "o+rwx" but all the files in the directory still have "-rwx------" as there permitions. does this mean they are not set?
2009-02-23T22:21:00.000Z	sipior	freegoo	they're set, just not to what you want. this is a fat32 filesystem, i guess?
2009-02-23T22:21:00.000Z	freegoo	sipior	yes it is. does chmod support fat32
2009-02-23T22:24:00.000Z	sipior	freegoo	not exactly. look into mounting the volume with the "umask" and "uid" options set to what you want.
2009-02-23T22:33:00.000Z	freegoo	sipior	thanks alot i will have a look
2009-02-23T23:07:00.000Z	sipior	freegoo	what filesystem are you inspecting, and what tool were you using?
2009-02-23T23:08:00.000Z	freegoo	sipior	i tryed using "debugfs" on "/dev/sda3" ext3
2009-02-23T23:10:00.000Z	sipior	freegoo	that's not a mounted partition i hope!
2009-02-23T23:10:00.000Z	freegoo	sipior	lol let me check
2009-02-23T23:14:00.000Z	freegoo	sipior	no the partition is not mount.
2009-02-23T23:15:00.000Z	freegoo	sipior	i get the error /dev/sda3: Bad magic number in super-block while opening filesystem
2009-02-23T23:15:00.000Z	freegoo	sipior	but there are 2 other partitions on the same physical disk. and they are mounted
2009-02-23T23:18:00.000Z	sipior	freegoo	have you tried running fsck on the filesystem? what were you using debugfs to look for, btw?
2009-02-27T20:13:00.000Z	sipior	freegoo	you can have a look at the hfsprogs package
2009-02-27T20:13:00.000Z	sipior	freegoo	or just use a mac, i suppose :-)
2009-02-27T20:17:00.000Z	freegoo	sipior	hfsprocs is great, lil question what version of debain is used for ubuntu 8.10
2009-02-27T20:18:00.000Z	sipior	freegoo	ubuntu releases aren't tied to a specific debian release, to my knowledge. did you mean the package version of hfsprogs?
