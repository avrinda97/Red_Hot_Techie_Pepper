2010-03-27T08:43:00.000Z	Lance7		any 1 good one  with virtualbox and ubuntu?
2010-03-27T08:44:00.000Z	Lance7		i need some advice...
2010-03-27T08:44:00.000Z	Lance7		please
2010-03-27T08:44:00.000Z	Psi-Jack-	Lance7	Then just ask.
2010-03-27T08:52:00.000Z	Psi-Jack-	Lance7	Will this virtualmachine server be used for desktop, or server use?
2010-03-27T08:53:00.000Z	Psi-Jack-	Lance7	Then you don't want virtualbox AT ALL.
2010-03-27T08:53:00.000Z	Psi-Jack-	Lance7	Xen is your best friend.
2010-03-27T08:53:00.000Z	Psi-Jack-	Lance7	No
2010-03-27T08:57:00.000Z	Psi-Jack-	Lance7	Yeah, they do.
2010-03-27T09:00:00.000Z	Psi-Jack-	Lance7	Debian, OpenSUSE, and Ubuntu all have Xen
2010-03-27T09:03:00.000Z	Psi-Jack-	Lance7	Maybe 2gb max?
2010-03-27T09:03:00.000Z	Psi-Jack-	Lance7	Each Xen domU vm will have it's own swap anyway.
2010-03-27T09:05:00.000Z	Psi-Jack-	Lance7	Linux doesn't use swap for hibernation.
2010-03-27T09:09:00.000Z	Psi-Jack-	Lance7	That just plain depends actually.
2010-03-27T09:10:00.000Z	Psi-Jack-	Lance7	Being a virtualizer system, more drives is better. RAID10 will loose you 50% space for a major increase in performance.
2010-03-27T09:10:00.000Z	Psi-Jack-	Lance7	While Raid5, you get 75% of the performance and 25% loss of space, not quite as good.
2010-03-27T09:12:00.000Z	Psi-Jack-	Lance7	Of course.
2010-03-27T09:16:00.000Z	Psi-Jack-	Lance7	Actually, no filesystem is better. LVM would be the better route to go and let the xen-tools to create your lvm lv's
2010-03-27T09:17:00.000Z	Psi-Jack-	Lance7	You're SETUP is complicated. What'd you expect?
2010-03-27T09:19:00.000Z	Psi-Jack-	Lance7	if you use xen-tools, it will make the lvm volumes for you for your instances of each Xen domU
