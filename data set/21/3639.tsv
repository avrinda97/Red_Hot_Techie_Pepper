2008-11-19T12:18:00.000Z	gigel2006		what does this mean and how can I use it in ubuntu "use SSH to "xxxx.xxx.xx" with the username as "register" and the password as "user""
2008-11-19T12:19:00.000Z	nicku	gigel2006	ssh register@xxx.xxx.xx
2008-11-19T12:19:00.000Z	gigel2006	nicku	use it as a command in the terminal ?
2008-11-19T12:19:00.000Z	nicku		yes
2008-11-19T12:20:00.000Z	gigel2006	nicku	and then how do I connect to the shell account with irssi ?
2008-11-19T12:20:00.000Z	nicku	gigel2006	so you want to connect to a diffenrent machine with ssh and sun irssi there
2008-11-19T12:20:00.000Z	gigel2006	nicku	YES
2008-11-19T12:21:00.000Z	nicku	gigel2006	ssh register@xxx.xxx.xx.xx  and then you can run irssi with just commmand "irssi"
2008-11-19T12:21:00.000Z	nicku	gigel2006	or you can screen it with "screen -S irssi irssi"
2008-11-19T12:22:00.000Z	gigel2006	nicku	so once I do  ssh register@xxx.xxx.xx.xx the terminal window will be the terminal on the machine I connected to ?
2008-11-19T12:23:00.000Z	nicku	gigel2006	yes.. after that ssh command it will prompt for password and then you are on the remote machine
2008-11-19T12:23:00.000Z	gigel2006	nicku	oh ok thanks man !
2008-11-19T12:24:00.000Z	nicku		np
2008-11-19T12:24:00.000Z	gigel2006	nicku	oh one second, how do you set up your password ? " "use SSH to "xxxx.xxx.xx" with the username as "register" and the password as "user"""
2008-11-19T12:28:00.000Z	nicku	gigel2006	i don't really know if you can give the password already with the command. why would you want to do so
2008-11-19T12:28:00.000Z	gigel2006	nicku	oh nevermind, it asks for a password after the command
2008-11-19T12:29:00.000Z	nicku	gigel2006	usually you don't want to type your password in cleartext
2008-11-19T12:29:00.000Z	gigel2006	nicku	so for a shell they will know you by IP everytime you do the ssh command ?
2008-11-19T12:30:00.000Z	nicku	gigel2006	now i didn't understand
2008-11-19T12:31:00.000Z	gigel2006	nicku	so after you register, does the machine remember your ip? next time when you connect how do you connect - what is the command?
2008-11-19T12:31:00.000Z	nicku	gigel2006	the same command
