2008-08-20T16:17:00.000Z	grobda24		Hello. How do I check if a package comes as default with Hardy ? Search hardy main ?
2008-08-20T16:18:00.000Z	bazhang	grobda24	which one
2008-08-20T16:18:00.000Z	bazhang	grobda24	/msg ubottu info packagename
2008-08-20T16:22:00.000Z	grobda24	bazhang	thanks :)
2008-08-20T16:52:00.000Z	grobda24	bazhang	if ubottu says a package is "important" does that mean it's installed in all Ubuntu systems ?
2008-08-20T16:56:00.000Z	bazhang	grobda24	yes
2008-08-20T17:00:00.000Z	grobda24	bazhang	ok, thanks. I'm trying to find a dialog maker for scripts installed by default. There whiptail for the console. I wonder if there's a GUI one ?
2011-05-15T16:10:00.000Z	bazhang	grobda24	gnome is not exactly for old systems. try lubuntu
2011-05-15T16:11:00.000Z	grobda24	bazhang	no, that's not what I asked, but thanks anyway. I need that particular distro. I just want to know about all the optimisations ... removing compiz, etc.
2011-05-15T16:11:00.000Z	bazhang	grobda24	I'd start with minimal then build up
2011-05-15T16:12:00.000Z	grobda24	bazhang	no, sorry. I know what you mean. But it was simpler just going through the full installation.
2011-05-15T16:13:00.000Z	grobda24	bazhang	thanks :) I'll hv a look
2012-02-26T19:13:00.000Z	bazhang	grobda24	vlc, mplayer to name two
2012-02-26T19:14:00.000Z	grobda24	bazhang	tried those. They don't do the menu's properly
2012-02-26T19:14:00.000Z	bazhang	grobda24	what do you mean properly. they work 100% fine here
2012-02-26T19:15:00.000Z	grobda24	bazhang	that's interesting. So you have all menu options and perfectly looping background video ?
2012-02-26T19:15:00.000Z	bazhang	grobda24	correct
2012-02-26T19:16:00.000Z	grobda24	bazhang	what versions are you using ?
2012-02-26T19:16:00.000Z	bazhang	grobda24	whatver version is current on 11.04
2012-02-26T19:16:00.000Z	grobda24	bazhang	that's oneiric ?
2012-02-26T19:17:00.000Z	bazhang	grobda24	I have no 3d effects going on here, if that is an issue.
