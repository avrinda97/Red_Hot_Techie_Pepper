2008-06-30T09:29:00.000Z	fyreme		is there anyway to play *.wmv in ubuntu?
2008-06-30T09:30:00.000Z	fyreme		I have no luck with wine
2008-06-30T09:30:00.000Z	fyreme		mplayer?
2008-06-30T09:32:00.000Z	fyreme		mplayer is installed and it wanted a codec
2008-06-30T09:33:00.000Z	sauvin	fyreme	what was the codec, do you remember?
2008-06-30T09:35:00.000Z	sauvin	fyreme	tell me, what's in your /usr/lib/codecs?
2008-06-30T09:36:00.000Z	sauvin	fyreme	I'll give you whole MINUTES. :D
2008-06-30T09:38:00.000Z	sauvin	fyreme	I don't remember how to get those codecs from the ubuntu repos (W32codecs, maybe?) - what I did was bop over to the mplayer site, downloaded all the codecs and shoved them into /usr/lib/codecs.
2008-06-30T09:41:00.000Z	fyreme	sauvin	can you check what directory you put the codecs in?
2008-06-30T09:42:00.000Z	sauvin	fyreme	I DID check, so as not to give you false advise. My /usr/lib/codecs has all kinds of Windows DLL files, which are the codecs mplayer uses for some of the files it can play.
2008-06-30T09:48:00.000Z	sauvin	fyreme	where did you get the wmv you're trying to play?
2008-06-30T09:55:00.000Z	sauvin	fyreme	did mplayer tell you what codec it wanted in order to be able to play it?
2008-06-30T09:57:00.000Z	sauvin	fyreme	how are you launching mplayer?
2008-06-30T10:03:00.000Z	sauvin	fyreme	you don't have mplayer installed?
2008-06-30T10:07:00.000Z	fyreme	sauvin	i got a message that said it may be illegal in some countries?
2008-06-30T10:07:00.000Z	sauvin	fyreme	I got the same message. I can't repeat in the channel what I said in response.
2008-06-30T10:09:00.000Z	sauvin	fyreme	sooner or later, it's going to be illegal to go to the bathroom without a license. That's not going to stop people from going, although it MAY make the streets a bit more disgusting. Unless you're ripping and distributing copyrighted materials, don't worry about the legality of having some codecs and players on your computer.
2008-06-30T10:12:00.000Z	fyreme	sauvin	how do i enable multiverse?
2008-06-30T10:27:00.000Z	sauvin	fyreme	I used mplayer to view wmvs in fedora 2, six years ago.
2008-06-30T10:33:00.000Z	sauvin	fyreme	do you have non-free enabled?
2008-06-30T10:46:00.000Z	sauvin	fyreme	does this mean you watched your wmv? :D
