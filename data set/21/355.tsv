2012-09-19T20:47:00.000Z	rgenito_		i believe i am having an issue with my wireless connection that is really pissing me off... :D
2012-09-19T20:47:00.000Z	rgenito_		this happens on wireless at home, in the office, etc
2012-09-19T20:47:00.000Z	rgenito_		i've noticed... my internet connection goes down exactly every 30 minutes
2012-09-19T20:47:00.000Z	rgenito_		...and then the connection resumes 5 minutes later.
2012-09-19T20:47:00.000Z	rgenito_		does anyone know where i can start looking to investigate this issue?
2012-09-19T20:48:00.000Z	deadmund	rgenito_	just a guess.  the DHCP client address lease time?
2012-09-19T20:49:00.000Z	rgenito_	deadmund	that's my guess too
2012-09-19T20:50:00.000Z	deadmund	rgenito_	so change it :)
2012-09-19T20:50:00.000Z	rgenito_	deadmund	is that a setting i can change on here? if so, where do i begin to look? ;D
2012-09-19T20:50:00.000Z	deadmund	rgenito_	the client can request a certain lease time but by default it does not.  The router determines the lease time (since it is the dhcp server_
2012-09-19T20:50:00.000Z	deadmund	rgenito_	note: I am assuming you have a router and a dhcp server running on it
2012-09-19T20:51:00.000Z	rgenito_	deadmund	yes, i'm assuming that is the case at the office... however at my personal office and at my house this same thing happens @_@ i think? :D
2012-09-19T20:51:00.000Z	deadmund	rgenito_	oh really... that changes everything.  Do you have a /etc/dhcp/  or something similar?
2012-09-19T20:51:00.000Z	rgenito_	deadmund	yes, i do have a /etc/dhcp folder
2012-09-19T20:52:00.000Z	deadmund	rgenito_	IS there some dhcp.conf folder in it?
2012-09-19T20:53:00.000Z	deadmund	rgenito_	yeah... try uncommenting and setting one.  Perhaps the issue is in the wifi driver but changing this setting will fix the problem.
2012-09-19T20:53:00.000Z	rgenito_	deadmund	ya i think it might be the driver too. before i updated ubuntu ... i had issues about every 5-10 minutes with my internet connection on this thing!
2012-09-19T20:54:00.000Z	rgenito_	deadmund	so ima see how this uncommenting helps ;)
2012-09-19T20:54:00.000Z	deadmund	rgenito_	good luck
2012-09-19T20:59:00.000Z	rgenito_	deadmund	i have no idea if this is going to help :)
2012-09-19T20:59:00.000Z	deadmund	rgenito_	me either
