2008-02-25T20:02:00.000Z	j_		is there a progrqam to use iso like daemon tool?
2008-02-25T20:03:00.000Z	robn	j_	you want to mount the iso?
2008-02-25T20:03:00.000Z	j_	robn	yea
2008-02-25T20:03:00.000Z	robn	j_	mount -o loop -t iso9660 file.iso /mnt/test <-----obviously tweak it for your filenames/needs
2008-02-25T20:06:00.000Z	robn	j_	i beleive there is also some software to do it called AcetoneISO or something
2008-02-25T20:07:00.000Z	j_	robn	can i find that in add/remove
2008-02-25T20:09:00.000Z	robn	j_	possibly, i dont know, have a look in synaptic package manager
2008-02-25T20:11:00.000Z	j_	robn	can't find it
2008-02-25T20:11:00.000Z	robn	j_	what version of ubuntu you using?
2008-02-25T20:12:00.000Z	j_		7.04
2008-02-25T20:12:00.000Z	j_	robn	7.04
2008-02-25T20:13:00.000Z	robn	j_	there is a package for 7.10 which you could try but no guarantees, may be easier to mount it via the commandline
2008-02-25T20:13:00.000Z	j_	robn	how i use this $ sudo mount -o loop -t /media/M4A1/hardy-desktop-i386.iso /dev/cdrom
2008-02-25T20:14:00.000Z	j_	robn	is that correct?
2008-02-25T20:15:00.000Z	robn	j_	dont think so no
2008-02-25T20:16:00.000Z	robn	j_	create a directory to mount to with "sudo mkdir /media/isomount"
2008-02-25T20:17:00.000Z	j_	robn	so that created a folder whats next
2008-02-25T20:17:00.000Z	robn	j_	then use "sudo mount -o loop -t iso9660 /media/M4A1/hardy-desktop-i386.iso /media/isomount"
2008-02-25T20:17:00.000Z	robn	j_	now when you open the folder /media/isomount you should see the contents of the cd
2008-02-25T20:18:00.000Z	j_	robn	alright it >,< works perfectly thx
2008-02-25T20:19:00.000Z	robn	j_	no probs, have fun
