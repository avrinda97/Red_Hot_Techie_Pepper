2011-05-04T04:25:00.000Z	ray24		If an external hd was originally formated on a windows, it should be able to on linux?
2011-05-04T04:25:00.000Z	ray24		For some reason, linux isn't letting me format my external drive
2011-05-04T04:26:00.000Z	geus	ray24	what message do you het?
2011-05-04T04:26:00.000Z	ray24		"error creating filesystem"
2011-05-04T04:27:00.000Z	geus	ray24	what command/program are you using?
2011-05-04T04:27:00.000Z	ray24	geus	I right click on the hd to format, just straight off linux
2011-05-04T04:28:00.000Z	geus	ray24	never done it like that, is the disk unmounted? I always use gparted
2011-05-04T04:28:00.000Z	ray24		wait, I just realized I had "ext" as type of format
2011-05-04T04:28:00.000Z	ray24		Nope, still didn't work. I changed it to NTSF type
2011-05-04T04:29:00.000Z	geus	ray24	, is the disk unmounted?
2011-05-04T04:29:00.000Z	ray24		it's mounted
2011-05-04T04:29:00.000Z	ray24		I can access the files on it,but I can't delete or create new files on it, which is why I'm formating
2011-05-04T04:33:00.000Z	geus	ray24	easy answer: use gparted, unmount the drive and repartition/format
2011-05-04T04:33:00.000Z	ray24	geus	it seems that I Don't have permission to access/delete my files on external
2011-05-04T04:34:00.000Z	geus		yeah, figured that much
2011-05-04T04:35:00.000Z	geus	ray24	you could cd to the drive and type "sudo chown -R yourusername" (make sure you have backups of all your data 1st)
2011-05-04T04:36:00.000Z	geus	ray24	otherwise try gparted
2011-05-04T04:37:00.000Z	ray24	geus	its formating now, I'm not sure if it was because I downloaded gparted as I did not use it.
2011-05-04T04:37:00.000Z	geus	ray24	good!
2011-05-04T04:37:00.000Z	ray24	geus	you're great, thanks.
2011-05-04T04:38:00.000Z	ray24	geus	it works now :) thanks again dude!!
