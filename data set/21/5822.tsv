2007-07-30T10:02:00.000Z	DShepherd	ThatGuy213	gtk-window-decorator --replace &  #maybe that will help
2007-07-30T10:02:00.000Z	ThatGuy213	DShepherd	that just puts it back to the default mode
2007-07-30T10:03:00.000Z	DShepherd	ThatGuy213	hmm... have you checked the wiki?
2007-07-30T10:03:00.000Z	ThatGuy213	DShepherd	typically it just works... so nope I haven't checked it
2007-07-30T10:03:00.000Z	DShepherd	ThatGuy213	so it worked before?
2007-07-30T10:04:00.000Z	ThatGuy213	DShepherd	last time I had ubuntu installed on this computer, yes, I switched off to gentoo to try that for awhile, and now I'm back to ubuntu
2007-07-30T10:04:00.000Z	DShepherd	ThatGuy213	I had that issue when I was using Trevin
2007-07-30T10:05:00.000Z	DShepherd	ThatGuy213	but I dont think you've gone that far.. right?
2007-07-30T10:05:00.000Z	ThatGuy213	DShepherd	nope, I'll double check that compiz is installed, I've already gone through all the updates
2007-07-30T10:05:00.000Z	ThatGuy213	DShepherd	yup, I have compiz
2007-07-30T10:07:00.000Z	DShepherd	ThatGuy213	not sure why that happens..

2007-07-30T10:08:00.000Z	DShepherd	ThatGuy213	yeah.. i think you may need to add that line to your xorg.conf. restart X and see if it works this time
2007-07-30T10:10:00.000Z	ThatGuy213	DShepherd	tyvm, that did it
