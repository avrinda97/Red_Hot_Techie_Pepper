2009-10-24T02:50:00.000Z	k5ehx	system4041	you need to mount the NTFS partition read / write
2009-10-24T02:50:00.000Z	system4041	k5ehx	but im in a live cd i need to move files from my unbootable ubuntu 9.04 to my bootable windows 7 ntfs partition
2009-10-24T02:51:00.000Z	k5ehx	system4041	um, I can't remember. The live CD used to mount things read only.
2009-10-24T02:52:00.000Z	system4041	k5ehx	basicly i need sudo access to my ext3 partition via live cd so as to move files to my ntfs partition
2009-10-24T02:52:00.000Z	k5ehx	system4041	it should mount your ext3 partition if it is valid
2009-10-24T02:53:00.000Z	k5ehx	system4041	if not you may have to repair it
2009-10-24T02:53:00.000Z	system4041	k5ehx	it is valid but i dont have the access to move the files it keeps saying access denied
2009-10-24T02:53:00.000Z	k5ehx	system4041	you want to copy instead of move, and you have to mount the NTFS partition writable to do that.
2009-10-24T02:53:00.000Z	system4041	k5ehx	 like trying to edit a file in live cd u have to open it with sudo in gedit in order to save your changes well i need such access in file explorer so as to move my files
2009-10-24T02:54:00.000Z	k5ehx	system4041	ahh, I think you want to use gksudo and run the browser (nautilus?) manually
2009-10-24T02:54:00.000Z	system4041	k5ehx	 The folder ".ssh" cannot be handled because you do not have permissions to read it.
2009-10-24T02:55:00.000Z	system4041	k5ehx	 howd i do that
2009-10-24T02:55:00.000Z	k5ehx	system4041	like hit alt-f2, type "gksudo nautilus" or /usr/bin/whatever, dunno where it is.
2009-10-24T02:56:00.000Z	k5ehx	system4041	yeah, "gksudo nautilus" works on my 9.04 install
2009-10-24T02:56:00.000Z	system4041	k5ehx	that done the trick my files are copying over now thanks for your help dude
2009-10-24T02:57:00.000Z	k5ehx	system4041	sorry it took me a bit to figure out what you meant. :-)
2009-10-24T02:58:00.000Z	system4041	k5ehx	lol cool man thanks i been spendin hours trying to find apps for windows that will read my ext3 partition so i could copy files over but none seemed to work in win 7 ultimate shoulda just came here first lmao cheers again man
2009-10-24T02:58:00.000Z	k5ehx	system4041	yeah, you'd think windows would make it easier to migrate from linux. :-)
