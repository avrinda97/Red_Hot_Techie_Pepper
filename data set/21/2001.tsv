2010-02-25T08:56:00.000Z	Blackcamaro8		Yes. Version 179, nVIDIA forceware.
2010-02-25T08:56:00.000Z	dj_segfault	Blackcamaro8	I thought it was up to 185 or so?
2010-02-25T08:58:00.000Z	dj_segfault	Blackcamaro8	Damn!  I hate that they're removing old cards.  AMD is worse, though.  I got burned by that last month.
2010-02-25T09:01:00.000Z	Blackcamaro8	dj_segfault	Yeah, it sucks.. I upgraded my primary system(the one I'm on) to a GF 6200A-LE and decided to upgrade my secondary(sitting next to it) to handle better graphical applications. Windows is having no problems with the card, but Ubuntu is working... relatively okay. THe only problem is slowness caused by CPU being at 100%/50-70%. >_<
2010-02-25T09:02:00.000Z	dj_segfault	Blackcamaro8	Can you justify spending $30 or so on another card?
2010-02-25T09:03:00.000Z	Blackcamaro8	dj_segfault	No, the card works perfectly fine. It's something to do with the way Ubuntu is handling the drivers. The card works great for Portal and Garry's Mod in Windows.
2010-02-25T09:09:00.000Z	dj_segfault	Blackcamaro8	Yeah, but not sure I can help with the driver issue
2010-02-25T09:11:00.000Z	Blackcamaro8	dj_segfault	This is a different issue. It has to do with startup commands. I have tried all the ways to make a command happen on startup that I could find, yet I can't get 'modprobe ndiswrapper' to run on startup, and I have to manually type it into the terminal every time I boot, which is annoying. Ndiswrapper handles Windows wireless drivers for Netgear cards. I just want a WORKING way to make the command work upon login/
2010-02-25T09:12:00.000Z	dj_segfault	Blackcamaro8	Put the command in /etc/rc.local, which runs after all the other services start up.  You might want to put a service network restart after it.
2010-02-25T09:13:00.000Z	dj_segfault	Blackcamaro8	what happened when you tried?  Did you redirect the output and look at it?
2010-02-25T09:14:00.000Z	Blackcamaro8	dj_segfault	When I tried, I logged in, my desktop was exactly as before, and my wireless card was not even detected.
2010-02-25T09:15:00.000Z	dj_segfault	Blackcamaro8	Remember that /etc/rc.local, like crontab files, doesn't have all your env vars and path.  Make sure to specify all paths.  Also, noticing it didn't work is NOT the same thing as looking at the output to see if it's telling you why it didn't work.  Please do the latter.
2010-02-25T09:16:00.000Z	Blackcamaro8	dj_segfault	Are you against using PMs on IRC?
2010-02-25T09:17:00.000Z	dj_segfault	Blackcamaro8	/sbin/modprobe ndiswrapper > /tmp/modprobe.out 2>&1    then look at that file after you reboot
2010-02-25T09:19:00.000Z	dj_segfault	Blackcamaro8	  Put this in /etc/rc.local (without the quotes)   "/sbin/modprobe ndiswrapper > /tmp/modprobe.out 2>&1"
2010-02-25T09:19:00.000Z	dj_segfault	Blackcamaro8	That is, look at /tmp/modprobe.out.
2010-02-25T09:20:00.000Z	Blackcamaro8	dj_segfault	I don't have a directory called rc.local. o_o?
2010-02-25T09:20:00.000Z	dj_segfault	Blackcamaro8	rc.local is a file you can create in the /etc directory
2010-02-25T09:20:00.000Z	Blackcamaro8	dj_segfault	Oh okay. Hold on...
2010-02-25T09:21:00.000Z	dj_segfault	Blackcamaro8	Are you typing this on the machine we're talking about?
2010-02-25T09:21:00.000Z	Blackcamaro8	dj_segfault	No. I'm sitting at two, it's the one to my right that I am troubleshooting.
