2006-06-25T09:20:00.000Z	wikkix		updatedb?
2006-06-25T09:20:00.000Z	wikkix		oh yeah
2006-06-25T09:20:00.000Z	wikkix		try sudo first
2006-06-25T09:20:00.000Z	wikkix		I'm trying to get cron to run my jobs
2006-06-25T09:21:00.000Z	wikkix		but something isn't working and I guess there is no mail on the system by default
2006-06-25T09:21:00.000Z	gdb	wikkix	updatedb is already run daily out of the box
2006-06-25T09:21:00.000Z	gdb	wikkix	You do not need to create a new cron entry for it.
2006-06-25T09:22:00.000Z	gdb	wikkix	sorry for the confusion ;-)
2006-06-25T09:22:00.000Z	gdb	wikkix	Do you have an MTA installed?
2006-06-25T09:22:00.000Z	gdb	wikkix	sendmail, postfix, exim, etc
2006-06-25T09:22:00.000Z	gdb	wikkix	That is probably why.
2006-06-25T09:24:00.000Z	gdb	wikkix	Well, since cron tells you whats going on via mail... you can probably find something in /var/log.
2006-06-25T09:29:00.000Z	gdb	wikkix	Is that all on one actual line?
2006-06-25T09:29:00.000Z	gdb	wikkix	if it's not, you need a \ at the end of the first line.
2006-06-25T09:29:00.000Z	gdb	wikkix	ah ok
2006-06-25T09:29:00.000Z	gdb	wikkix	I wonder if you're using an editor that's line wrapping.
2006-06-25T09:30:00.000Z	gdb	wikkix	No worries!
2006-06-25T09:34:00.000Z	gdb	wikkix	Can you run that from the command line and it works?
2006-06-25T09:34:00.000Z	wikkix	gdb	yes
2006-06-25T09:35:00.000Z	gdb	wikkix	Well, unfortuantely, the only advice I can give is that I think you're using a goofy date format. ;-)
2006-06-25T09:38:00.000Z	gdb	wikkix	er %Y%m%d for no reason other than they stay in order and YYYYMMDD is more "standard" ;-)
