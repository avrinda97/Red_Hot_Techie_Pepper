2012-03-16T00:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	carli2	it should automount, did you safetly eject the device last time youremoved it, or did you just rip it out?
2012-03-16T00:15:00.000Z	carli2	ActionParsnip	I don't have a graphical shell installed, the gadget should be automated
2012-03-16T00:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	carli2	but did you safetly remove it last time you used it?
2012-03-16T00:15:00.000Z	carli2	ActionParsnip	as i said, i dont have nautilus installed, and I dont want to install nautilus
2012-03-16T00:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	carli2	I never mentioned nautilus....
2012-03-16T00:16:00.000Z	carli2	ActionParsnip	and /dev/sdb is there and ok. when i manually mount it, it works
2012-03-16T00:16:00.000Z	carli2	ActionParsnip	but i want it automated
2012-03-16T00:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	carli2	did you safe remove it / eject the device before you pulled it out last time it was in a system
2012-03-16T00:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	carli2	can you kindly answer my perfectly reasonable question please....
2012-03-16T00:18:00.000Z	carli2	ActionParsnip	yes godammed, I'm not talking about ejecting something, I want a simple package that contains udev rules that mounts a file system into /media
2012-03-16T00:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	carli2	it flushes the caches and is quite relevant to the situation
2012-03-16T00:19:00.000Z	carli2	ActionParsnip	why? there are no udev rules that do anything
2012-03-16T00:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	carli2	if you add an entry in /etc/fstab   it will be used, or you can use a udev rule
2012-03-16T00:20:00.000Z	carli2	ActionParsnip	removable devices are removable. I need a set of udev rules. but are there udev rules I can use? (or do I have to write my own?)
2012-03-16T00:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	carli2	you'll probably have to due to no gvfs,it may be installable in CLI, without desktop UI
2012-03-16T00:21:00.000Z	carli2	ActionParsnip	yes, gvfs is installable. does it add udev rules?
2012-03-16T00:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	carli2	it will watch for new devices etc, should make things nicer
