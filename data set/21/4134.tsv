2008-07-15T14:48:00.000Z	negge^	jigp	on my EeePC (which uses the Atheros wifi chipset) the proprietary drivers don't work so I had to download the madwifi driver and compile it myself in order to get wireless to work
2008-07-15T14:55:00.000Z	negge^	jigp	what kind of wifi chipset do you have?
2008-07-15T14:57:00.000Z	jigp	negge^	atheros
2008-07-15T14:57:00.000Z	negge^	jigp	yes but which model exactly. Write lspci in a terminal to check it
2008-07-15T14:58:00.000Z	negge^	jigp	you just posted a link to a thumbnail
2008-07-15T15:00:00.000Z	negge^	jigp	okay, I just checked and saw that you don't have the same card as I do so I don't know if the madwifi drivers would do any good for you.
2008-07-15T15:00:00.000Z	jigp	negge^	ok thanks.. :)
2008-07-15T15:02:00.000Z	negge^	jigp	check out http://madwifi.org/ anyway, the driver has been reported to work with quite many Atheros cards so it's always worth a try. You'll find installation instructions on the site, compiling it from source code is really easy and afaik the best way to do it
2008-07-15T15:10:00.000Z	jigp	negge^	how to extract the tar gz?
2008-07-15T15:10:00.000Z	jigp	negge^	done downloading the file tho

2008-07-15T15:11:00.000Z	negge^	jigp	disable the restricted driver before you install the madwifi one
