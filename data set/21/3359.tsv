2009-01-16T06:39:00.000Z	partialinfinity		Hello all. I'm running 7.04 liveCD so I can use testdisk and recover my fakeraid RAID0 structure... I've done this before recently and it worked well... I installed dmraid previously and it worked... but now I get an error when I try to install dmraid:
2009-01-16T06:39:00.000Z	partialinfinity		invoke-rc.d: initscript dmraid, action "start" failed.
2009-01-16T06:40:00.000Z	partialinfinity		so testdisk can't see my raid
2009-01-16T06:42:00.000Z	partialinfinity		anyone know why dmraid woud fail to install using apt-get?
2009-01-16T06:42:00.000Z	runderwo	partialinfinity	is that all the errors you get?  that's while installing dmraid?
2009-01-16T06:49:00.000Z	runderwo	partialinfinity	see the last message in this topic:  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=195432
2009-01-16T06:50:00.000Z	partialinfinity	runderwo	 thanks but I've been there, tried that
2009-01-16T06:54:00.000Z	runderwo	partialinfinity	the only thing I could suggest is try dpkg --purge dmraid and then install it again.
2009-01-16T06:54:00.000Z	runderwo	partialinfinity	otherwise, you'd have to strace -f invoke-rc.d dmraid start and try to figure out why it's failing.
2009-01-16T06:54:00.000Z	partialinfinity	runderwo	tried that and purge fails too  :/
2009-01-16T06:55:00.000Z	runderwo	partialinfinity	you can force it to work by editing /var/lib/dpkg/info/dmraid.prerm and adding an 'exit 0' line near the top.
2009-01-16T06:55:00.000Z	partialinfinity	runderwo	 did that before and it will purge... but the install just fails again like before
2009-01-16T06:56:00.000Z	runderwo	partialinfinity	try bash -v /etc/init.d/dmraid start
2009-01-16T06:57:00.000Z	runderwo	partialinfinity	that may at least give you an idea where the problem is.
2009-01-16T06:57:00.000Z	partialinfinity	runderwo	 what am I looking for?
2009-01-16T06:57:00.000Z	runderwo	partialinfinity	sudo, of course.
2009-01-16T06:57:00.000Z	runderwo	partialinfinity	look at what it does last before exiting with error.
2009-01-16T06:58:00.000Z	partialinfinity	runderwo	  * Setting up DMRAID devices...       $EXPR $COLS - 1
2009-01-16T06:58:00.000Z	partialinfinity	runderwo	 I don't see any error messages, it looks like it's printing the script... ?
2009-01-16T06:59:00.000Z	runderwo	partialinfinity	yes, it should print the script up until the point where it exits with error.
2009-01-16T06:59:00.000Z	partialinfinity	runderwo	 the line I pasted is the last line I see
