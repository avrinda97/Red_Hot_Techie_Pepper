2007-11-29T12:43:00.000Z	whyameye	utarpradesh	the easiest thing might be to run synaptic, do a search for your package, and look at the properties for the installed files.
2007-11-29T12:44:00.000Z	utarpradesh		but... it's not listed in synaptic

2007-11-29T12:47:00.000Z	whyameye	utarpradesh	I just googled the program. It's just a ruby script. It doesn't look like there is any install. Am I wrong?
