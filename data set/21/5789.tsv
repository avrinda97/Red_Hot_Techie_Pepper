2007-08-07T13:11:00.000Z	xstasi	wong	if your tough enough to run 7.10, you are tough enough to know how to do it
2007-08-07T13:12:00.000Z	xstasi	wong	it's NOT!
2007-08-07T13:12:00.000Z	xstasi	wong	7.10 is not out
2007-08-07T13:12:00.000Z	xstasi	wong	be prepared that the majority if your stuff won't work
2007-08-07T13:13:00.000Z	xstasi	wong	then good luck
2007-08-07T13:15:00.000Z	xstasi	wong	what are you saying :D
2007-08-07T13:15:00.000Z	wong	xstasi	was telling cheesegardener how to uninstall something
2007-08-07T13:15:00.000Z	xstasi	wong	and you say "aptitude install remove" ?
2007-08-07T13:16:00.000Z	xstasi	wong	you have a geek sister?
2007-08-07T13:18:00.000Z	xstasi	wong	/etc/apt
2007-08-07T13:20:00.000Z	xstasi	wong	are you sure you aren't messing with something you can't handle?
2007-08-07T13:20:00.000Z	xstasi	wong	i had troubles upgrading to gutsy, and i run Debian since when i was 13 in 2001.. :)
2007-08-07T13:21:00.000Z	xstasi	wong	normally, it *DOESN'T* happen
2007-08-07T13:22:00.000Z	xstasi	wong	no distribution is MAD enough to suggest people to upgrade their system to a beta
2007-08-07T13:23:00.000Z	xstasi	wong	yeah, if you are already using 7.10 alpha
2007-08-07T13:24:00.000Z	xstasi	wong	yeah, that's bad information
2007-08-07T13:25:00.000Z	xstasi	wong	can i ask you -why- you want to upgrade?
2007-08-07T13:25:00.000Z	xstasi	wong	so do what i said to sources.list
