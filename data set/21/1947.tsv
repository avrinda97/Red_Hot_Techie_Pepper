2010-03-08T09:31:00.000Z	elijah		How do I display the file creation date in tty?
2010-03-08T09:33:00.000Z	elijah		Or did tar see if they were identical and not overwrite?
2010-03-08T09:34:00.000Z	psilo2	elijah	there is no creation timestamp on ext3, which you probably use.
2010-03-08T09:35:00.000Z	psilo2	elijah	to be clear, it's not *nix that doesn't store it, it is the filesystem a lot of people choose (ext3)
2010-03-08T09:38:00.000Z	elijah	psilo2	Gotcha
2010-03-08T09:50:00.000Z	elijah	psilo2	-jailshell: fdisk: command not found
2010-03-08T09:45:00.000Z	psilo2	elijah	see anything by typing mount?
2010-03-08T09:45:00.000Z	elijah	psilo2	I see a bunch with "mount"
2010-03-08T09:45:00.000Z	psilo2	elijah	ls -lc is 'ctime' which is not necessarily what you think.
2010-03-08T09:46:00.000Z	elijah	psilo2	What is ctime?
2010-03-08T09:46:00.000Z	psilo2	elijah	what's mounted on /?  that'll be your filesystem.
2010-03-08T09:46:00.000Z	elijah	psilo2	/dev/root
2010-03-08T09:46:00.000Z	psilo2	elijah	paste that whole line. (one line please)
2010-03-08T09:47:00.000Z	psilo2	elijah	ctime == "change time";  as in, the last change to the file's metadata.  In the case of a file that was just created, ctime happens to be the creation time, but if the file's metadata is altered then it's no longer the same.
2010-03-08T09:48:00.000Z	elijah	psilo2	There are 20 more lines similar to that with mount
2010-03-08T09:48:00.000Z	elijah	psilo2	So it is likely change time then
2010-03-08T09:48:00.000Z	psilo2	elijah	pretty likely yeah
2010-03-08T09:49:00.000Z	elijah	psilo2	Which worked for me, in this case
2010-03-08T09:49:00.000Z	psilo2	elijah	how about fdisk -l /dev/root
2010-03-08T09:50:00.000Z	psilo2	elijah	dunno dude;  you can test easily anyway.
2010-03-08T09:51:00.000Z	elijah	psilo2	It's all good
