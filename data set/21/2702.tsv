2009-07-21T22:40:00.000Z	Phill		What total bullshit, my graphics card is no longer supported or something. Ughh.
2009-07-21T22:41:00.000Z	MaskedDriver	Phill	language?  and what card do you have?
2009-07-21T22:41:00.000Z	Phill	MaskedDriver	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-nv/+bug/5801 I have a Geforce 4MX (According to the sticker)
2009-07-21T22:42:00.000Z	MaskedDriver	Phill	then you're SOL I guess :(
2009-07-21T22:42:00.000Z	Phill	MaskedDriver	How did I get this to work in 8.04?
2009-07-21T22:42:00.000Z	MaskedDriver	Phill	probably installed the binary drivers from Nvidia and not the ones in the repos
2009-07-21T22:43:00.000Z	MaskedDriver	Phill	have you tried it?
2009-07-21T22:43:00.000Z	Phill	MaskedDriver	Of course, through the System > Admin > Hardware Drivers, I have.
2009-07-21T22:44:00.000Z	MaskedDriver	Phill	download the drivers directly from Nvidia 186.03 I think is the latest version
2009-07-21T22:44:00.000Z	Phill	MaskedDriver	Will do, where can I download them exactly?
2009-07-21T22:44:00.000Z	MaskedDriver	Phill	http://www.nividia.com
2009-07-21T22:45:00.000Z	MaskedDriver	Phill	then go to Download Drivers then select your card and OS
2009-07-21T22:45:00.000Z	Phill	MaskedDriver	Should I uninstall the auto one?
2009-07-21T22:46:00.000Z	MaskedDriver	Phill	it should do that for you automagically
2009-07-21T22:46:00.000Z	MaskedDriver	Phill	you're going to have to be comfy in the CLI because you need to kill gdm and the xserver to install it
2009-07-21T22:47:00.000Z	Phill	MaskedDriver	Awesome, here's a question, after i kill gdm with sudo killall gdm; how can I start it again?
2009-07-21T22:47:00.000Z	Phill	MaskedDriver	I use startx, but then - I don't know how to kill that one.
2009-07-21T22:47:00.000Z	MaskedDriver	Phill	you'll restart the PC after the install
2009-07-21T22:47:00.000Z	Phill	MaskedDriver	Got it, thanks.
2009-07-21T22:48:00.000Z	Phill	MaskedDriver	Well, be back in a second, I hope :)
2009-07-21T22:48:00.000Z	MaskedDriver	Phill	good luck!
