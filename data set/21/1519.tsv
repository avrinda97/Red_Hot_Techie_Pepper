2010-08-14T01:14:00.000Z	OzoneNerd		I have an Inspiron 17r with a fresh install of Ubuntu 10.4.  The internal speakers work fine, but when I plug in headphones, they go mute and no sound comes out of the headphones.  Any advice?
2010-08-14T01:15:00.000Z	shirtless	OzoneNerd	are they regular headphones or USB?
2010-08-14T01:15:00.000Z	shirtless	OzoneNerd	did they work before with another OS?
2010-08-14T01:15:00.000Z	OzoneNerd	shirtless	Standard audio jack.  The hardware is functional.
2010-08-14T01:15:00.000Z	shirtless	OzoneNerd	do you have a headphone jack in the front and back of your computer (ie) one direct to the sound card? Have you tried *both* jacks
2010-08-14T01:16:00.000Z	OzoneNerd	shirtless	There is only one audio jack on the side of my laptop.
2010-08-14T01:17:00.000Z	shirtless	OzoneNerd	have you checked all the volume settings in preferences?
2010-08-14T01:17:00.000Z	shirtless	OzoneNerd	try running alsamixer as well
2010-08-14T01:17:00.000Z	OzoneNerd	shirtless	I ran alsamixer and gave every volume setting a 50% or so.  The problem persisted.
2010-08-14T01:18:00.000Z	shirtless	OzoneNerd	lspci for your sound card and google the name of it with linux or ubuntu linux
2010-08-14T01:18:00.000Z	shirtless	OzoneNerd	see if anyone has had the same issue
2010-08-14T01:18:00.000Z	shirtless	OzoneNerd	if not, i'd file a bug.
2010-08-14T01:18:00.000Z	OzoneNerd	shirtless	On it.
2010-08-14T01:20:00.000Z	OzoneNerd	shirtless	I apparently have two audio cards.  One is a "00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 5 Series/3400 Series Chipset High Definition Audio (rev 06)" and the other is a "02:00.1 Audio device: ATI Technologies Inc Manhattan HDMI Audio [Mobility Radeon HD 5000 Series]"
2010-08-14T01:20:00.000Z	OzoneNerd		Is this relevant?
2010-08-14T01:20:00.000Z	shirtless	OzoneNerd	interesting
2010-08-14T01:20:00.000Z	shirtless	OzoneNerd	lets take a look at that
2010-08-14T01:20:00.000Z	shirtless	OzoneNerd	preferences->sound->hardware
2010-08-14T01:20:00.000Z	shirtless		go there
2010-08-14T01:21:00.000Z	shirtless	OzoneNerd	how many devices do you see
2010-08-14T01:21:00.000Z	OzoneNerd	shirtless	I'm there.  Both are listed, but there doesn't seem to be much to change.
