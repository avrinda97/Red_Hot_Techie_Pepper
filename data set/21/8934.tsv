2006-02-27T09:17:00.000Z	wastrel	Trilom	 does lspci show the nic's in the machine?
2006-02-27T09:18:00.000Z	wastrel	Trilom	 lspci shows your pci devices, look in the output for something that resembles a network card.
2006-02-27T09:18:00.000Z	wastrel	Trilom	 for example 0000:02:08.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corp. 82801BD PRO/100 VE (LOM) Ethernet
