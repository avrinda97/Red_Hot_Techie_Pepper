2010-02-10T12:34:00.000Z	nomnex		openoffice channel is not very responsive. Do I need Java JRE if I want to use Base? Is there an open JRE and would you recommend it vs. the Java JRE (karmic here). Thanks
2010-02-10T12:36:00.000Z	indus	nomnex	not needed except for some menu
2010-02-10T12:36:00.000Z	indus	nomnex	wizards etc wont work
2010-02-10T12:37:00.000Z	indus	nomnex	open office is a heavy package really, try the individual word processors abiword and gnumeric for spread sheets
2010-02-10T12:37:00.000Z	nomnex	indus	rww, if I don't need it for Base, what is the point? I don't really care about wizards, I leave that to MS Office
2010-02-10T12:38:00.000Z	indus	nomnex	btw, i forgot what base is, like access?
2010-02-10T12:38:00.000Z	nomnex	indus	yes, but I will use it as a front end with postgresql
2010-02-10T12:39:00.000Z	indus	nomnex	ok
2010-02-11T14:14:00.000Z	indus	nomnex	with sudo apt-get install wine
2010-02-11T14:16:00.000Z	nomnex	indus	same I don't want to run, I want to open it
2010-02-11T14:16:00.000Z	indus	nomnex	yes install wine first
2010-02-11T14:16:00.000Z	indus	nomnex	with the command sudo apt-get install wine
2010-02-11T14:16:00.000Z	indus	nomnex	then just double click and open exe
2010-02-11T14:17:00.000Z	nomnex	indus	to open (see the content of a .exe)? Wine will run it, I don't want that
2010-02-11T14:17:00.000Z	indus	nomnex	an exe can never be opened
2010-02-11T14:18:00.000Z	nomnex	indus	do you mean on Linux? of course you can open them on Windoze when you decompile a software
2010-02-11T14:18:00.000Z	indus	nomnex	yes when you decompile, but your question is different
2010-02-11T14:19:00.000Z	nomnex	indus	is there a Linux software to decompile .exe?
2010-02-11T14:19:00.000Z	indus	nomnex	no idea
2010-02-11T14:19:00.000Z	nomnex	indus	thanks
2010-02-11T14:26:00.000Z	nomnex	indus	FIY, I found one decompiler running on Ubuntu, boomerang, http://boomerang.sourceforge.net/ reading the doc now
