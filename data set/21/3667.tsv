2010-04-13T19:47:00.000Z	alejandro		why does my computer not recongnize wlan0 device but i am connected to wireless?
2010-04-13T19:47:00.000Z	progre55	alejandro	maybe it's not wlan0?
2010-04-13T19:48:00.000Z	progre55	alejandro	try "iwconfig"
2010-04-13T19:48:00.000Z	alejandro	progre55	it has info under eth2
2010-04-13T19:49:00.000Z	progre55	alejandro	are you sure you typed iwconfig, not ifconfig?
2010-04-13T19:49:00.000Z	progre55	alejandro	if you did, then you got it, it's called eth2
2010-04-13T19:49:00.000Z	alejandro	progre55	yes
2010-04-13T19:50:00.000Z	alejandro	progre55	well i am trying to use airmon-ng and it doesnt seem to work with eth2
2010-04-13T19:51:00.000Z	progre55	alejandro	is it on monitor mode or managed mode?
2010-04-13T19:52:00.000Z	progre55	alejandro	on the second line of its info, it should say smth like "Mode:Managed" or "Mode:Monitor"
2010-04-13T19:52:00.000Z	alejandro	progre55	oh yeah how do i find that out again i believe it is monitor
2010-04-13T19:53:00.000Z	progre55	alejandro	iwconfig
2010-04-13T19:53:00.000Z	alejandro	progre55	it says managed
2010-04-13T19:53:00.000Z	progre55	alejandro	in order to run airmon, you need to be on monitor mode
2010-04-13T19:54:00.000Z	alejandro	progre55	k how do i change that?
2010-04-13T19:54:00.000Z	progre55	alejandro	you can start it by typing "airmon-ng start eth2" as far as I remember..
2010-04-13T19:55:00.000Z	progre55	alejandro	havent installed aircrack on my new comp yet, so I cant test =)
2010-04-13T19:55:00.000Z	progre55	alejandro	and actually, I'm not sure if this is the right place to discuss aircrack
2010-04-13T19:58:00.000Z	alejandro	progre55	http://paste.ubuntu.com/413691/
2010-04-13T20:00:00.000Z	progre55	alejandro	are you using wireless only? I mean, when you are airdumping, you should better not use the same card to connect to the internet. otherwise it will be hopping between channels..
2010-04-13T20:00:00.000Z	progre55	alejandro	and as I said, it's not really the place for teaching you hacking and all )
