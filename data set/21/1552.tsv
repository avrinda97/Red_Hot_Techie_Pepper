2010-07-30T02:50:00.000Z	Underscore		Hi everyone. I'm new to Ubuntu, and I was wondering what the best way to install it would be for me - I want a persistent install which runs speedily (IE not in something like virtualbox) and without installing it too deeply in my system to begin with - I run Windows 7 at the moment. Thanks.
2010-07-30T02:51:00.000Z	iceroot	Underscore	what does "not to deeply means" in this context?
2010-07-30T02:52:00.000Z	Underscore	iceroot	Basically I want to be able to easily remove it if I need to - it seems a lot of installs require formatting of drives and allocating permanent space on a drive
2010-07-30T02:53:00.000Z	iceroot	Underscore	hm, maybe wubi is an option for you, which you can later transform into a stand-alone system
2010-07-30T03:02:00.000Z	iceroot	Underscore	you can use a usb-drive
2010-07-30T03:03:00.000Z	Underscore	iceroot	Oh, indeed, I just read that - how much space does it take?
2010-07-30T03:03:00.000Z	iceroot	Underscore	700mb
2010-07-30T03:03:00.000Z	Underscore	iceroot	Oh, that's good
2010-07-30T03:03:00.000Z	Underscore	iceroot	Also, I see it recommends the 32-bit edition. Why is that? Wouldn't the 64 be faster?
2010-07-30T03:04:00.000Z	iceroot	Underscore	64bit doesnt mean faster
2010-07-30T03:04:00.000Z	iceroot	Underscore	and i dont know why 32bit should be recommend? who said that?
2010-07-30T03:04:00.000Z	Underscore	iceroot	The website - 32-bit - Recommended for most users 64-bit - Not recommended for daily desktop usage
2010-07-30T03:05:00.000Z	Underscore	iceroot	But wouldn't 64-bit utilize more memory?
2010-07-30T03:05:00.000Z	iceroot	Underscore	dont know why, sorry
2010-07-30T03:05:00.000Z	iceroot	Underscore	yes 64bit is using more then 4gb ram ad working fine here on my lucid-installation
2010-07-30T03:05:00.000Z	iceroot	Underscore	with 4gb ram you need 64bit version
2010-07-30T03:06:00.000Z	Underscore	iceroot	That's what I was thinking, I have 64 bit on windows. Was just curious as to why the website advises 32 bit.
2010-07-30T03:19:00.000Z	iceroot	Underscore	64bit
2010-07-30T03:19:00.000Z	iceroot	Underscore	dont use 32bit and dont use pae
2010-07-30T03:19:00.000Z	Underscore	iceroot	pae?
2010-07-30T03:20:00.000Z	Underscore	iceroot	linxeh: Ok, thanks, I'll go for 64-bit :)
