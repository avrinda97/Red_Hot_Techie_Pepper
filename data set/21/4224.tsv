2009-05-06T19:31:00.000Z	LinuxApe		Is there anyway to tell what parts of a jaunty upgrade may not be correct?  Since the upgrade, which didn't seem to finish completely, my system is messed up in a couple of key ways, like printing.
2009-05-06T19:31:00.000Z	danbhfive	LinuxApe	how did it not finish correctly?
2009-05-06T19:32:00.000Z	LinuxApe	danbhfive	Screen was nothing but closely spaced vertical lines.  Had to reboot.  Trying to rerun upgrade produces nothing new.
2009-05-06T19:33:00.000Z	danbhfive	LinuxApe	sudo apt-get install -f   ?
2009-05-06T19:35:00.000Z	LinuxApe	danbhfive	 result is a couple of messages about some a few unneeded packages, but that's all.
2009-05-06T19:35:00.000Z	danbhfive	LinuxApe	no, those packages are needed
2009-05-06T19:37:00.000Z	LinuxApe	danbhfive	 apt-get install -f  reports: The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required:  foomatic-db-gutenprint ijsgutenprint mozilla-thunderbird liblrdf0
2009-05-06T19:38:00.000Z	danbhfive	LinuxApe	oh, can you install pastebinit?
2009-05-06T19:40:00.000Z	LinuxApe	danbhfive	installed pastebinit, what do I do with that?
2009-05-06T19:43:00.000Z	danbhfive	LinuxApe	try this: sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop^ | pastebinit
2009-05-06T19:46:00.000Z	LinuxApe	danbhfive	 Actually, I'm a kubuntu user, with apt-get install kubuntu-desktop provide the same info?
2009-05-06T19:48:00.000Z	danbhfive	LinuxApe	o, yeah
2009-05-06T19:50:00.000Z	LinuxApe	danbhfive	 http://pastebin.com/f19c65b79
2009-05-06T19:52:00.000Z	danbhfive	LinuxApe	is this an upgrade?
2009-05-06T19:52:00.000Z	LinuxApe	danbhfive	 upgrade from intrepid to jaunty via internet.
2009-05-06T19:53:00.000Z	danbhfive	LinuxApe	yeah, pastebinit /etc/apt/sources.list

2009-05-06T19:57:00.000Z	danbhfive	LinuxApe	well, its hard to say.  Those repos are not stable
2009-05-06T19:58:00.000Z	LinuxApe	danbhfive	 Don't think anything in there would have broken things like printing and thunderbird.....
2009-05-06T20:02:00.000Z	danbhfive	LinuxApe	you also have scrollkeeper installed, which was an upgrade issue.  I don't know how to remove obsolete packages from the CLI, but using synaptic, its pretty easy
2009-05-06T20:03:00.000Z	LinuxApe	danbhfive	 Okay - I'll check the scrollkeeper issue and remove it if I think it's problematic.
