2010-04-22T04:59:00.000Z	rafaelsoaresbr		quick question: how change recursively the ower and group of a directory?
2010-04-22T05:00:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	rafaelsoaresbr	chown -r owner:group directory
2010-04-22T05:01:00.000Z	rafaelsoaresbr	bastid_raZor	nsadmin, Typos_King: I want to change the owner of /var/spool/squid to "squid:squid"
2010-04-22T05:01:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	rafaelsoaresbr	prepend with sudo
2010-04-22T05:04:00.000Z	rafaelsoaresbr	bastid_raZor	nsadmin, Typos_King: invalid option 'r'...
2010-04-22T05:04:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	rafaelsoaresbr	-R
2010-04-22T05:05:00.000Z	rafaelsoaresbr	bastid_raZor	nsadmin, Typos_King: okay, that worked, thanks
2010-06-23T03:49:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	rafaelsoaresbr	is the UUID of swap the same in /etc/fstab as told but 'sudo blkid' ?
2010-06-23T03:50:00.000Z	rafaelsoaresbr	bastid_raZor	does I need to restart to check that?
2010-06-23T03:51:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	rafaelsoaresbr	no, cat /etc/fstab | grep -i swap    then the next command sudo blkid | grep -i swap
2010-06-23T03:52:00.000Z	rafaelsoaresbr	bastid_raZor	thanks, the answer is: no, UID has been changed!, maybe Mandriva has changed it.
2010-06-23T03:53:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	rafaelsoaresbr	make the changes in /etc/fstab and you're all set.. after making the changes do: sudo mount -a  .. swap should be mounted.. you can check by free -m
2010-06-23T03:56:00.000Z	rafaelsoaresbr	bastid_raZor	sudo mount -a swap? nothing happened, SWAP is still disabled
2010-06-23T03:56:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	rafaelsoaresbr	no, just sudo mount -a   after that command type free -m  .. that should show your swap
2010-06-23T03:57:00.000Z	rafaelsoaresbr	bastid_raZor	still nothing.
2010-06-23T03:58:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	rafaelsoaresbr	how did you make the changes to /etc/fstab ?
2010-06-23T04:01:00.000Z	rafaelsoaresbr	bastid_raZor	copy and paste. better restart and see if it worked, very thanks
2010-06-23T04:01:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	rafaelsoaresbr	sudo mount -a will do the same as restarting..
2010-06-23T04:03:00.000Z	rafaelsoaresbr	bastid_raZor	be back in few minutes, thanks
2010-06-23T04:05:00.000Z	rafaelsoaresbr	bastid_raZor	worked, thanks
2010-06-23T04:06:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	rafaelsoaresbr	glad to help.
