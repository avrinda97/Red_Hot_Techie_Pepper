2008-05-21T17:10:00.000Z	sipior	erUSUL	oh right, that's what he was trying to do :)
2008-06-11T16:39:00.000Z	sipior	erUSUL	why are you wasting my time?
2008-06-11T16:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	sipior	Pici ouch there is no "you can search my brains at ..."
2008-06-11T16:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	sipior	ubotu used to have "You can search my brains at <url>" on that factoid ...
2008-06-11T16:41:00.000Z	sipior	erUSUL	ah well. perhaps something to add when ubotu gets back...
2009-01-20T17:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	sipior	vinja-sheep no it does not you need sun-java6-plugin
2009-01-20T17:30:00.000Z	sipior	erUSUL	apt-cache search doesn't actually show such a package...
2009-01-20T17:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	sipior	not in 64 bits
2009-01-20T17:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	sipior	becouse there is no plugin for 64 bits you have to use the icedtea/openjava one
2009-01-20T17:33:00.000Z	sipior	erUSUL	interesting. i stand corrected.
2009-04-23T17:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	sipior	dassouki it is better to use update-rc.d or bum
2009-04-23T17:55:00.000Z	sipior	erUSUL	i don't particularly care for that.
2009-04-23T17:55:00.000Z	sipior	erUSUL	matter of taste, i suppose.
2009-04-24T19:30:00.000Z	sipior	erUSUL	very wise :-)
2009-04-24T19:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	sipior	i know XD
2010-09-14T21:41:00.000Z	sipior	erUSUL	well, we still use tar. i keep hoping pax will catch on...
2010-09-14T21:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	sipior	gnu tar can create pax files ( it does not have some of the niftty features of pax command though)
2010-09-14T21:44:00.000Z	sipior	erUSUL	sure, but i'm not interested in the file format. the nifty features are the point! :-)
2011-01-24T22:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	sipior	nly if you specify it « sed -i"bak" 'action' file » afaik
2011-01-24T22:02:00.000Z	sipior	erUSUL	yes indeed.
2011-03-09T19:24:00.000Z	sipior	erUSUL	just yesterday, in fact. perhaps they'll check back in today.
