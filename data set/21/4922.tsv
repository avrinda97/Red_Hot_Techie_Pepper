2011-02-02T00:22:00.000Z	[1]Smith		*placed
2011-02-02T00:23:00.000Z	[1]Smith		so i go to turminal and then just write  sudo apt-get install "name-of-file"
2011-02-02T00:23:00.000Z	[1]Smith		it will get installed
2011-02-02T00:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[1]Smith	no, you type:   sudo apt-get install vlc
2011-02-02T00:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[1]Smith	what is the filename
2011-02-02T00:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[1]Smith	kill the caps
2011-02-02T00:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[1]Smith	vlc is in the repos
2011-02-02T00:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[1]Smith	use software centre and you can install vlc easily
2011-02-02T00:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[1]Smith	you dont need it, its worthless
2011-02-02T00:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[1]Smith	yes
2011-02-02T00:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[1]Smith	yes, just like it doesnt matter in windows either
2011-02-02T00:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[1]Smith	forget the file you manually downloaded, it is of absolutely ZERO value to you
2011-02-02T00:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[1]Smith	because vlc is already in the repositorys waiting to be downloaded, the command I gave will install it and everything vlc needs to work, so the file you have isn't needed in any way shape or form
2011-02-02T00:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	[1]Smith	nearly all the software you will need is in the repositories, Windows expects you to know and hunt the web for useful stuff, Ubuntu has a centralized app for adding and removing software
