2009-01-06T15:08:00.000Z	Ileden		Hi! I finally switched my laptop to ubuntu, and my wireless connection is slow (1 Mb/s). I found out the problem is with my RaLink RT2500 card drivers (rt2500pci), and found out that alternative drivers are available at rt2x00.serialmonkey.com. Problem is, I don't know how to install these drivers, since I'm pretty much still a beginner with ubuntu. Can anyone help?
2009-01-06T15:09:00.000Z	rww	Ileden	quick question before you get started. What type of encryption does the access point you're trying to connect to use? Possible answers: None, WEP, WPA, WPA2...
2009-01-06T15:09:00.000Z	Ileden	rww	WPA/WPA2
2009-01-06T15:10:00.000Z	Ileden	rww	(WPA, if I remember correctly)
2009-01-06T15:11:00.000Z	rww	Ileden	the legacy drivers downloadable from that site won't work for you, then. They don't support wpa_supplicant, which is needed for WPA.
2009-01-06T15:11:00.000Z	Ileden	rww	aw. :( Thanks for the info though.
2009-01-06T15:12:00.000Z	rww	Ileden	open up a terminal and type "uname -r". That'll tell you what kernel version you have. I might have an alternative for you.
2009-01-06T15:12:00.000Z	Ileden	rww	I could switch to WEP, but rather not since it's somewhat weak.
2009-01-06T15:12:00.000Z	Ileden	rww	2.6.27-9-generic
2009-01-06T15:13:00.000Z	rww	Ileden	http://rt2x00.serialmonkey.com/wiki/index.php/Downloads says that anything higher than 2.6.24 should have drivers for rt2x00 in it already
2009-01-06T15:14:00.000Z	rww	Ileden	oh, wait, nvm, you had problems with that, I see.
2009-01-06T15:14:00.000Z	rww	Ileden	well, the alternative won't work with WPA. Realtek drivers kinda suck (I have rtk8187 and it disconnects randomly). Sorry :(
2009-01-06T15:16:00.000Z	Ileden	rww	Ah. :( So is the problem with bad hardware support from the card manufacturer? Should I mail them (not that it would help me, though.)?
2009-01-06T15:17:00.000Z	Ileden	rww	also, are there some known good manufacturer that I should get a new card from?
2009-01-06T15:17:00.000Z	rww	Ileden	I have no idea, to be honest. For good manufacturers, you might want to check the Hardware Compatibility List.
2009-01-06T15:18:00.000Z	Ileden	rww	ok, thanks! Too bad you couldn't help solve the problem, but you did save me a lot of hassle! :)
2009-01-06T15:56:00.000Z	Ileden	rww	Just to be sure... if I did switch to WEP, I'd then also have to install the alternative drivers from the wlan to work at full speed?
2009-01-06T15:57:00.000Z	rww	Ileden	I have no idea. If you're having speed problems with the non-legacy driver, then I'd assume so.
2009-01-06T15:58:00.000Z	Ileden	rww	Yeah, I imagine so too.
2010-04-28T12:23:00.000Z	rww	Ileden	the bug you linked is a duplicate. You should be paying attention to https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-ati/+bug/444139 instead
2010-04-28T12:25:00.000Z	Ileden	rww	thanks. I really should learn to use launchpad someday...
