2009-08-21T23:48:00.000Z	terrestre	Nava2	i was askiing you, how did you do so many partitions
2009-08-21T23:48:00.000Z	Nava2	terrestre	I don't know. I think it fucked up
2009-08-21T23:48:00.000Z	terrestre	Nava2	gparted will let you put all that together without any file lost, but its gonna take a while
2009-08-21T23:48:00.000Z	Nava2	terrestre	how?
2009-08-21T23:49:00.000Z	terrestre	Nava2	i am a gparted user for a while never have an issue with it, even for partition and put together a vista partition
2009-08-21T23:50:00.000Z	terrestre	Nava2	you can use a gparted live cd or just use a gparted version inside ubuntu
2009-08-21T23:50:00.000Z	Nava2	terrestre	same. I think it was because I didnt "close" gparted. I finished everything I was doing then I just restarted the computer
2009-08-21T23:50:00.000Z	Nava2	terrestre	go on..
2009-08-21T23:51:00.000Z	Nava2	terrestre	I have gparted open, where do I go from here?
2009-08-21T23:52:00.000Z	terrestre	Nava2	well, you cant tweak a mount partitions so right know you only can deleted every empty partition
2009-08-21T23:52:00.000Z	terrestre	Nava2	well, you cant tweak a mount partitions so right know you only can deleted every unoumted and empty partition
2009-08-21T23:52:00.000Z	Nava2	terrestre	every one is empty
2009-08-21T23:53:00.000Z	terrestre	Nava2	just delete all of them
2009-08-21T23:53:00.000Z	Nava2	terrestre	then what does that leave me with..
2009-08-21T23:57:00.000Z	terrestre	Nava2	after delete them you can resize every "correct" partition to  ocupy the rest empty space in your HD, did I clear enough?
2009-08-21T23:58:00.000Z	Nava2	terrestre	I'd like to try and keep my files though =/
2009-08-21T23:58:00.000Z	terrestre	Nava2	"resize" option didnt delete anything
2009-08-21T23:59:00.000Z	terrestre	Nava2	 i will help you waite
