2011-03-08T08:45:00.000Z	cesurasean		Is there anyway to accidently install grub2 twice on a hard drive?
2011-03-08T08:45:00.000Z	cesurasean		the first time gave me file not found, but 2nd try worked
2011-03-08T08:45:00.000Z	cesurasean		i just want to make sure the first time i tried didn't install anything on one of the partitions
2011-03-08T08:45:00.000Z	cesurasean		or does grub ONLY install to devices?
2011-03-08T08:46:00.000Z	drobole_	cesurasean	you should be good. it will just write to mbr unless you ask it to do otherwise
2011-03-08T09:03:00.000Z	cesurasean	drobole_	how do i find out which one is being used?
2011-03-08T08:47:00.000Z	cesurasean	drobole_	what do you mean unless you ask it to do otherwise?
2011-03-08T08:48:00.000Z	drobole_	cesurasean	i think it is possible to write grub to a partition
2011-03-08T08:51:00.000Z	drobole_	cesurasean	no need to remove any of them. only one of them will be in use. the one that resides on the dist the BIOS jumps to
2011-03-08T08:52:00.000Z	cesurasean	drobole_	how do i remove the one I don't need?
2011-03-08T08:53:00.000Z	drobole_	cesurasean	i think so yes, if you installed it on a partition
2011-03-08T08:58:00.000Z	drobole_	cesurasean	thats not a problem, unless you want something else there. The thing is, grub doesn't change what disk your BIOS jumps to. BIOS always only jumps to one disk, if it finds grub there the rest goes well
2011-03-08T09:03:00.000Z	drobole_	cesurasean	yes you want to know what grub is in use so you update the right one, I was just saying that having a copy of grub on another disk doesnt hurt in any way
2011-03-08T09:06:00.000Z	drobole_	cesurasean	so you have installed grub on /dev/sdb1 or something?
2011-03-08T09:07:00.000Z	drobole_	cesurasean	do you know what /dev/sdb1 points to?
2011-03-08T09:15:00.000Z	cesurasean	drobole_	are you sure that one can be deleted?
2011-03-08T09:15:00.000Z	drobole_	cesurasean	im 99% sure :D
2011-03-08T09:18:00.000Z	drobole_	cesurasean	i would be careful with that
2011-03-08T09:18:00.000Z	drobole_	cesurasean	gimme 1 min...
2011-03-08T09:21:00.000Z	drobole_	cesurasean	if you do: less /boot/grub/grub.cfg you should be able to see if it uses / or /media/SYSTEM RECOVERY
2011-03-08T09:23:00.000Z	drobole_	cesurasean	its a bit messy but it should say something like "linux   /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.35-27-generic"
