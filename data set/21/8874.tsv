2005-12-26T08:41:00.000Z	aqua		tried it on widows...works ok..
2005-12-26T08:41:00.000Z	gnube	aqua	is cdrom in your fstab file?
2005-12-26T08:41:00.000Z	gnube	aqua	then try mount /media/cdrom0
2005-12-26T08:42:00.000Z	aqua	gnube	ok, still get mount: No medium found
2005-12-26T08:42:00.000Z	gnube	aqua	You are trying you read a DVD on a CDROM drive?
2005-12-26T08:43:00.000Z	gnube	aqua	Gotcha, that just sounds like a format error that I have ssen before.
2005-12-26T08:44:00.000Z	aqua	gnube	ok....could you tell me how to get everything ok?
2005-12-26T08:45:00.000Z	gnube	aqua	That is the hard part. What are you using to read the fiell?
2005-12-26T08:46:00.000Z	aqua	gnube	sorry, didn't get you. what do you mean what am I using to read it? i can't even mount it let alone read it
2005-12-26T08:47:00.000Z	gnube	aqua	It may have been automatically mounted on the desktop, if not let me see what I can google.
2005-12-26T08:51:00.000Z	aqua	gnube	any luck on the cause of this strange (for me) issue???
2005-12-26T08:53:00.000Z	gnube	aqua	look at this
2005-12-26T09:05:00.000Z	aqua	gnube	all of that sounds great but it didn't help me with my initial problem....that the cd that i just burned in k3b with an avi file ubuntu can't mount (and i know that the burning process was successful because i was able to access the file in windows on the same pc)
2005-12-26T09:05:00.000Z	gnube	aqua	And the file is a CD?
2005-12-26T09:06:00.000Z	aqua	gnube	the file is on the cd
