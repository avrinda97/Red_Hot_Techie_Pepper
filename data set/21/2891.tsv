2010-10-25T17:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kuttans	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chromium-daily/ppa; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install chromium-browser
2010-10-25T17:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kuttans	it downloads the files to your system using the installer, then installs it
2010-10-25T17:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kuttans	you could make a script I guess, you can use zenity or python to make a pretty frontend
2010-10-25T17:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kuttans	i'd ask in #python
2010-10-25T17:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kuttans	then you need to register yor nick
2011-02-04T10:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kuttans	details please
2011-02-04T10:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kuttans	if you run:  uname -r   are you running the new kernel?
2011-02-04T10:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kuttans	that kernel isnt supported here
2011-02-04T10:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kuttans	if you boot to the maverick kernel, is it ok
2011-02-04T10:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kuttans	if you use 2.6.35.25  is it ok?
2011-02-04T10:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kuttans	then your issue is with an unofficial kernel which we cannot possibly support
2011-02-04T10:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kuttans	if you use 3rd party kernels your support isnt here
2011-02-04T10:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kuttans	i suggest you ask in #vbox
2011-02-04T10:26:00.000Z	kuttans	ActionParsnip	: can you tell me about this error in a makefile in /var/lib/dkms/vboxhost/.0.2/build/make.log says this fatal error: linux/autoconf.h: No such file or directory
