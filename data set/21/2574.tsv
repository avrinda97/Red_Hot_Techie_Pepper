2009-09-18T23:33:00.000Z	dwatkins	something132	you mean to boot from the ISO? If so, look into unetbootin
2009-09-18T23:38:00.000Z	dwatkins	something132	how are you running unetbootin?
2009-09-18T23:39:00.000Z	dwatkins	something132	what file is it?
2009-09-18T23:40:00.000Z	dwatkins	something132	I would need to know what you downloaded in order to help
2009-09-18T23:42:00.000Z	dwatkins	something132	sorry, I don't see that you mentioned the name/type of the file itself
2009-09-18T23:43:00.000Z	dwatkins	something132	unetbootin is in the ubuntu repositories, it might be easier to install it with synaptic
2009-09-18T23:45:00.000Z	dwatkins	something132	start synaptic from the system->administration menu, it has its own help information
2009-09-18T23:46:00.000Z	dwatkins	something132	those are where synaptic gets installfiles from (automatically)
2009-09-18T23:55:00.000Z	dwatkins	something132	from the commandline do "sudo apt-get install unetbootin" then run it from the system->administration menu, I think it'ws called "USB startup disk creator"
2009-09-18T23:59:00.000Z	dwatkins	something132	that's already enabled by default
2009-09-18T23:59:00.000Z	dwatkins	something132	& genii-around - what I didn't realise until now, is that there are two seperate packages, unetbootin and usb-creator, I imagine it would be easiest for something132 to install usb-creator, not unetbootin
2009-09-19T00:01:00.000Z	dwatkins	something132	doesn't windows use its own partitioning tool?
2009-09-19T00:05:00.000Z	dwatkins	something132	windoze will do the partitioning for you (assuming it doesn't just delete your ubuntu partition), it sounds like you need to resize your ubuntu partition, so there's room for windoze
2009-09-19T00:07:00.000Z	dwatkins	something132	the install ISO is a live CD and will work if you put it on a USB stick with unetbootin/usb-creator
