2006-10-07T05:12:00.000Z	XiXaQ		Is there any way to hide Evolution and only get a new mail notification like Outlook?
2006-10-07T05:14:00.000Z	kyja	XiXaQ	there is something realy neat let me find it
2006-10-07T05:21:00.000Z	kyja	XiXaQ	search for gnubiff in synaptic it is awsome little applet
2006-10-07T05:22:00.000Z	XiXaQ	kyja	thanks :)
2006-10-07T05:41:00.000Z	XiXaQ	kyja	gnubiff seems nice, but then I have to start evolution when I get new mail and stop it when I want it to disappear?
2006-10-07T05:45:00.000Z	kyja	XiXaQ	sorry, I had to step out. you can make a double click for it in the expert mode of the applet.
2006-10-07T05:46:00.000Z	kyja	XiXaQ	so it can launch evolution or what ever client you use on a double click.
2006-10-07T05:47:00.000Z	XiXaQ	kyja	but I still have to stop and start it? I'd like to have it running, but in the background with an icon in the notification area.
2006-10-07T05:48:00.000Z	kyja	XiXaQ	I guess I dont understand. it tells me when new mail comes. quacks and give a gdm. you can click the gdm to get a preview of the mail. double click the icon to launch the email client and read the full thing. I dont understand what you realy want I guess. sorry
2006-10-07T05:51:00.000Z	XiXaQ	kyja	starting and stopping Evolution takes more resources than simply hiding and showing it.
2006-10-07T05:52:00.000Z	kyja	XiXaQ	oh ic. you could modify the gdm display of the aplet to show bigger widow to read your mail if it isnt too big. then launch evolution only if you have to. perhaps also there are other solutions. I am looking in the expert config now.
2006-10-07T05:54:00.000Z	XiXaQ	kyja	but I'm not interested in only mail. The calendars and other stuff is also useful. I open and close Outlook all the time. It's a waste of resources to start and stop it every five minutes..
2006-10-07T05:55:00.000Z	kyja	XiXaQ	I understand what you mean now. you want to hide and show the app. hmmm. there must be something one sec
2006-10-07T06:08:00.000Z	kyja	XiXaQ	libevolution-ruby1.8 do anything for you? you could write a lighter app to query evolution data.
2006-10-07T06:09:00.000Z	XiXaQ	kyja	well, notification is ok. I can fix that with gnubiff. Is there a way to show and hide a running application?
2006-10-07T06:10:00.000Z	kyja	XiXaQ	there must be but I dont know what it is at this time. maybe if we look in the man pages we can at least get terminal commands to work with gdm windows.
2006-10-07T06:14:00.000Z	XiXaQ	kyja	a gdm window is a general window in GNOME?
2006-10-07T06:15:00.000Z	kyja	XiXaQ	its the desktop manager of gnome but I am thinking that is not it. now I am looking in man xorg
2006-10-07T06:23:00.000Z	kyja	XiXaQ	sorry I could not help more.
2006-10-07T07:02:00.000Z	XiXaQ	kyja	You were very helpful. :) thanks.
2006-10-07T07:03:00.000Z	kyja	XiXaQ	your welcome
