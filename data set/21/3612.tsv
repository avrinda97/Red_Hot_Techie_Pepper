2008-11-26T04:17:00.000Z	lexvegas		I have a Gateway with a RTL8187 wireless card, it will connect to my router, i will get an ip address, DNS, and all the good stuff, but Firefox and any other program that uses internet wont connect to the internet. Any ideas?
2008-11-26T04:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lexvegas	can you ping the routers ip?
2008-11-26T04:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lexvegas	can you ping 38.99.130.180
2008-11-26T04:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lexvegas	in terminal
2008-11-26T04:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lexvegas	ping <whatever you router's ip is>
2008-11-26T04:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lexvegas	it'll be your default gateway's ip on your pc
2008-11-26T04:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lexvegas	try: ping 38.99.130.180
2008-11-26T04:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lexvegas	then your wan connection isnt working, if yuo can connect to the router and get an ip then your link to the router is ok, just after that isnt right. you could try rebooting the router
2008-12-10T02:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lexvegas	try a different driver
2008-12-10T02:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lexvegas	run lspci or lsusb depending on how it connects and websearch how to configure it
2008-12-10T02:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lexvegas	are you fully updated?
2008-12-10T02:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lexvegas	what is the lspci output line for the device?
2008-12-10T02:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lexvegas	the RTL8187b driver in the kernel is expremental, i dont know why the hell they added the driver to the kernel when its dont works and officially unfinished. thats from http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=965946

2011-02-06T05:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lexvegas	all those apps do is install specified packages, if you know the packages (or can find out) you don't need those things
2011-02-06T05:52:00.000Z	lexvegas	ActionParsnip	I didnt know that. I guess the only other place i have installed drivers manually (or attempted to) is debian and ARCH
2011-02-06T05:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lexvegas	if you buy mega compatible hardware it will all work out of the box like all my systems do :)
2011-02-06T05:53:00.000Z	lexvegas	ActionParsnip	if only I knew when i bought. Im still fairly young, so when i bought i didnt know much about linux at all, other than i could barely install it on my old VPR matrix
