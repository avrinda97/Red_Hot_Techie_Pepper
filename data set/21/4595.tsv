2008-03-24T15:42:00.000Z	Adpad		I'm really battling with this: unable to get the system to work with any video drivers other than vesa drivers.  I have a GeForce 6600GT.  I have tried apt-get install, xorg reconfigure, manually editing the sync modes, restricted drivers, and Envy.  When I start, I either get a blue screen or "No Signal" until I restore the xorg config with the vesa driver enabled..
2008-03-24T15:43:00.000Z	algyz	Adpad	 don't configure manually
2008-03-24T15:43:00.000Z	algyz	Adpad	 sudo nvidia-xconfig
2008-03-24T15:44:00.000Z	algyz	Adpad	 maybe you should try #nvidia?
2008-03-24T15:49:00.000Z	algyz	Adpad	 did you try either sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx or nvidia-glx-new?
2008-03-24T15:50:00.000Z	Adpad	algyz	- I tried the nvidia-glx-new, yeah
2008-03-24T15:51:00.000Z	algyz	Adpad	 the easiest way is to use envy or restricted manager
2008-03-24T15:51:00.000Z	Adpad	algyz	- Ive tried both of those
2008-03-24T15:51:00.000Z	algyz	Adpad	 I think if you tried to install drivers manually, then you should continue doing this
2008-03-24T15:52:00.000Z	algyz	Adpad	are you long time with ubuntu?
2008-03-24T15:53:00.000Z	algyz	Adpad	 the best way I think is to reinstall, then in fresh install just do sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-new
2008-03-24T15:53:00.000Z	algyz	Adpad	 I would prefer doing like this
2008-03-24T15:53:00.000Z	algyz	Adpad	 afterwards sudo nvidia-xconfig
2008-03-24T15:53:00.000Z	algyz	Adpad	 hope it will work
2008-03-24T15:54:00.000Z	Adpad	algyz	- yes, I did a clean install now.  All I've done so far is install nvidia-glx-new and nvidia-xconfig
2008-03-24T15:54:00.000Z	algyz	Adpad	 maybe first you downloaded drivers from nvidia?
2008-03-24T15:54:00.000Z	algyz	Adpad	 after installing drivers you have to restart system
2008-03-24T15:55:00.000Z	algyz	Adpad	 did you restart the computer?
2008-03-24T15:56:00.000Z	Adpad	algyz	- afraid so.. I've also tried some other stuff like editing the SYNC frequencies manually
2008-03-24T15:57:00.000Z	algyz	Adpad	 pastebin your /etc/X11/xorg.conf into www.pastebin.ca and show the link
2008-03-24T15:59:00.000Z	algyz	Adpad	maybe enable composite?
