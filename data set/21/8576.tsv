2006-03-14T14:46:00.000Z	Enthusiast78	nalioth	sorry. :o|
2006-03-27T12:42:00.000Z	Enthusiast78	nalioth	: I think I don't have GDM, but let's try...
2006-03-27T12:42:00.000Z	nalioth	Enthusiast78	replace it with kdm or w/e your window mangler is
2006-03-27T12:42:00.000Z	Enthusiast78	nalioth	: sudo: /etc/init.d/gdm: command not found
2006-03-27T12:42:00.000Z	Enthusiast78	nalioth	: I have only installed xserver-xorg and evilwm
2006-03-27T12:42:00.000Z	nalioth	Enthusiast78	are you using gnome or kde ?
2006-03-27T12:43:00.000Z	nalioth	Enthusiast78	ah, i see. install xubuntu-desktop
2006-03-27T12:43:00.000Z	Enthusiast78	nalioth	: Isn't there another way? I would like to have only the minimal Xorg and evilwm installed.
2006-03-27T12:44:00.000Z	nalioth	Enthusiast78	you'll need more than an xserver installed
2006-03-27T12:45:00.000Z	Enthusiast78	nalioth	: I see. But it will also install xfce4. I'd really like to avoid installing unnecessary things.
2006-03-27T12:46:00.000Z	nalioth	Enthusiast78	you need a window manager. install gdm
2006-03-27T12:46:00.000Z	Enthusiast78	nalioth	: isn't gdm a login manager?
2006-03-27T12:46:00.000Z	nalioth	Enthusiast78	it is a window manager
2006-03-27T12:54:00.000Z	nalioth	Enthusiast78	install it
2006-03-27T12:55:00.000Z	nalioth	Enthusiast78	make sure you run "sudo apt-file update" before you run it
2006-03-27T12:58:00.000Z	Enthusiast78	nalioth	: Thanks.
2006-03-27T13:36:00.000Z	Enthusiast78	nalioth	: You were right. xinit is the package that installs startx, but still... Looks like I need many more things to get X working... :(
2006-03-27T13:36:00.000Z	Enthusiast78	nalioth	: I'll go with xubuntu-desktop for now...
2006-03-27T13:37:00.000Z	nalioth	Enthusiast78	xubuntu-desktop is the smallest group of progs that will get you going
2006-03-27T13:37:00.000Z	Enthusiast78	nalioth	: At least it's half the size of Gnome or KDE. :)
