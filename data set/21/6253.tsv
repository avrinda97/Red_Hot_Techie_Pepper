2007-05-01T06:10:00.000Z	LjL	sercik	i don't think so
2007-05-06T05:28:00.000Z	LjL	sercik	it's not a filesystem driver though, just a stand-alone application. which might be a good thing... depends what you want.
2007-05-06T05:29:00.000Z	LjL	sercik	your nickname certainly does ring a bell
2007-05-06T05:30:00.000Z	LjL	sercik	you say rc.local is not executed? why?
2007-05-06T05:36:00.000Z	sercik	LjL	that script please
2007-05-06T05:38:00.000Z	LjL	sercik	/etc/rc.local not /etc/re.local - but i suppose that was a typo. try  grep rc.local /etc/init.d/* , does that show up with anything?
2007-12-04T20:17:00.000Z	LjL	sercik	uh, add that repository to your sources.list?
2007-12-04T20:18:00.000Z	LjL	sercik	i think so :)
2007-12-04T20:18:00.000Z	LjL	sercik	that will be because the other repo has a more recent version of the package, i guess
2007-12-04T20:18:00.000Z	LjL	sercik	it
2007-12-04T20:19:00.000Z	LjL	sercik	it's likely that you can achieve that with pinning, but i can't guide you there
2007-12-04T20:21:00.000Z	LjL	sercik	http://apt4rpm.sourceforge.net/faq.html#q32
2007-12-04T20:23:00.000Z	sercik	LjL	thank you
2007-12-04T20:24:00.000Z	LjL	sercik	that seems like what you want, just change * into the package name i guess
2007-12-04T20:26:00.000Z	sercik	LjL	can you see this: http://pastebin.ca/805657 don't notice something strange?
