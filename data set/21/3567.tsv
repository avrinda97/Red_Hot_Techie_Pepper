2008-11-30T02:02:00.000Z	gpled	exodus_ms	yep. not sure what 8.10 did to the drivers

2008-11-30T02:07:00.000Z	gpled	exodus_ms	looks like ubuntuforums.org is having proxy problems
2008-11-30T02:07:00.000Z	gpled	exodus_ms	i can read the first page. the artical is from 2006
2008-11-30T02:09:00.000Z	gpled		i dont understand why the modules would be gone. nor how to get them back
2008-11-30T02:09:00.000Z	gpled		unless they changed the name
2008-11-30T02:10:00.000Z	exodus_ms	gpled	did you have a working sound card before updating to 8.10
2008-11-30T02:11:00.000Z	gpled	exodus_ms	yep
2008-11-30T02:12:00.000Z	gpled	exodus_ms	i can see it with lspci
2008-11-30T02:15:00.000Z	gpled		how do i get the modules for ES1983S loaded into my 8.10 system?
2008-11-30T02:15:00.000Z	exodus_ms	gpled	do you have GNOME ALSA Mixer
2008-11-30T02:18:00.000Z	exodus_ms	gpled	I have to go but this is a 'newer' link that might help --> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=6078737#post6078737
2008-11-30T02:19:00.000Z	exodus_ms	gpled	btw, the first link I sent to you shows how to load the modules :)
2008-11-30T02:20:00.000Z	gpled	exodus_ms	i am removing gnome alsa mixer, then reinstalling it.   can load the module, because their is no module to load
2008-11-30T02:23:00.000Z	gpled	exodus_ms	your talking about sudo modprobe
2008-11-30T02:23:00.000Z	gpled		?
2008-11-30T02:31:00.000Z	exodus_ms	gpled	have you tried installing following package 'sudo killall pulseaudio' 'sudo alsa force-reload' and then go to System>Preferences>Sound and change everything to ALSA
2008-11-30T02:31:00.000Z	gpled	exodus_ms	think all that is for people who have their sound drivers loaded
2008-11-30T02:32:00.000Z	gpled	exodus_ms	i can not find the module to load
2008-11-30T02:34:00.000Z	exodus_ms	gpled	can you not load the maestro3 module, be it OSS or alsa?
