2005-04-11T09:06:00.000Z	Xeon3D	mathmatt	was that for me?
2005-04-11T09:08:00.000Z	Xeon3D	mathmatt	I got a program from ubuntuforuns.org, but that was what made the bug.. i ran it under a normal user.... and now I have 2 icons for the same thing on the menu... I wanted to erase one...
2005-04-11T09:09:00.000Z	Xeon3D	mathmatt	yup.. but now I can't delete that package...
2005-04-11T09:10:00.000Z	Xeon3D	mathmatt	it doesn't work :(
2005-04-11T09:12:00.000Z	Xeon3D	mathmatt	don't you happen to know how can I manually erase it?
2005-04-11T09:13:00.000Z	mathmatt	Xeon3D	the menu-editor app or the menu entries?
2005-04-11T09:16:00.000Z	mathmatt	Xeon3D	try removing whatevermenuitem.desktop from /usr/share/applications
2005-04-11T09:17:00.000Z	mathmatt	Xeon3D	let me know if you find it there
2005-04-11T09:18:00.000Z	Xeon3D	mathmatt	yup that did it!
2005-04-11T09:18:00.000Z	mathmatt	Xeon3D	great!
2005-04-11T09:21:00.000Z	Xeon3D	mathmatt	you wouldn't know why doesn't an icon show up on a gnome menu entry even if its path is correctly entered?
2005-04-11T09:22:00.000Z	mathmatt	Xeon3D	try sudo gedit /usr/share/applications/themenuentry.desktop and see if the correct Icon=something.png is there
2005-04-13T08:04:00.000Z	mathmatt	Xeon3D	do you know the path for the login screen files?
2005-04-13T08:04:00.000Z	mathmatt	Xeon3D	drum roll
2005-04-13T08:04:00.000Z	Xeon3D	mathmatt	u don't know?
2005-04-13T08:05:00.000Z	mathmatt	Xeon3D	yes, but the screen I want is not in there
2005-04-17T07:16:00.000Z	Xeon3D	mathmatt	... erm.. under networking .. try disabling or unsetting the "DHCP" option.
2005-04-17T07:17:00.000Z	mathmatt	Xeon3D	thanks, I'll try that...
2005-04-17T07:18:00.000Z	Xeon3D	mathmatt	and syn1 : it only takes that time cause it's trying to get an address from a DHCP Server.
2005-04-17T07:18:00.000Z	mathmatt	Xeon3D	that makes sense!
