2009-07-07T15:23:00.000Z	timofonic		I'm using Ubuntu 9.04 right now. There's a problem detecting a USB mass storage device and not know how to solve it: http://pastebin.com/d99acef5
2009-07-07T15:23:00.000Z	timofonic		Please, would someone help me in solving this problem? I need to do a backup of personal data in a USB HDD, but Ubuntu doesn't recognize the device :(
2009-07-07T15:25:00.000Z	GiJ	timofonic	What's the model/brand of the USB device?
2009-07-07T15:28:00.000Z	timofonic	GiJ	It's hard to explain, reall it uses a SATA/IDE to USB adapter Genesys Logic
2009-07-07T15:29:00.000Z	timofonic	GiJ	I use an adapter for that, a cheap chinese one using that chip :)
2009-07-07T15:30:00.000Z	GiJ	timofonic	I'm quite the linux nuby, but you could try checking the brand's site, thats why I asked for it ,D
2009-07-07T15:31:00.000Z	timofonic	GiJ	Well, they make chips and such...
2009-07-07T15:31:00.000Z	timofonic	GiJ	It's mentioned as Linux compatible out there on tons of chinese and english sites...
2009-07-07T15:35:00.000Z	timofonic	GiJ	Linux mentioned even on the manufacturer site... http://www.genesyslogic.com/_en/product_01_1.php?id=18
2009-07-07T15:38:00.000Z	GiJ	timofonic	Google's clueless about it :(
2009-07-07T15:38:00.000Z	timofonic	GiJ	Damn. Where can I ask about this then? Are there some place to ask about this type of problems in Ubuntu?
2009-07-07T15:38:00.000Z	timofonic	GiJ	A specific one, I mean
2009-07-07T15:38:00.000Z	timofonic	GiJ	Where devs are and such...

2009-07-07T15:39:00.000Z	timofonic	GiJ	Ok
2009-07-07T15:40:00.000Z	GiJ	timofonic	Sorry for being quite useless :(
