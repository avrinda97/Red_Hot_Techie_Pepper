2007-05-27T06:54:00.000Z	jack		hi, simple question: what do i need to do to get remote x11 connections to work? i got kubuntu-feisty runnig, but i need that box only as a remote x11 terminal
2007-05-27T06:54:00.000Z	jack		port 6000 is reachable only over lo0
2007-05-27T06:56:00.000Z	jack		no, thanks, i need x11 connections to work
2007-05-27T06:57:00.000Z	jack		without nx, vnc, ssh, lalala
2007-05-27T06:57:00.000Z	jack		ok? ok.
2007-05-27T06:57:00.000Z	jack		you think i'm not, smo? think more
2007-05-27T06:58:00.000Z	jack		i know x11 connectivity is ancient
2007-05-27T06:58:00.000Z	jack		but still ;)
2007-05-27T06:59:00.000Z	jack		your choice, reiserfs or ext3
2007-05-27T07:01:00.000Z	jack		remote x11 connections? i removed "-nolisten tcp", rebooted X, did the necessary "xhost +", netstat looks like port 6000 is listening to *:*, but i can telnet to port 6000 only from 127.0.0.1, not from the lan. what the f**k is missing?
2007-05-27T07:02:00.000Z	IdleOne	jack	stop cursing please
2007-05-27T07:02:00.000Z	jack	IdleOne	start giving helpful hints instead, please
2007-05-27T07:03:00.000Z	IdleOne	jack	soon as you stop acting like a jackass I will... follow the rules and you might get more help then you are now
2007-05-27T07:05:00.000Z	IdleOne	jack	getting mad wont help you to get your prob fixed.sometimes it's best to walk away for an hour or so then come back and attack the issue again
2007-05-27T07:05:00.000Z	jack	IdleOne	the time you spent with giving me oh so nice hints about behaviour could be used a lot better, imo
2007-05-27T07:06:00.000Z	IdleOne	jack	I tried being nice to you and me telling you about your attitude is the first step at solving the problems your having but now I see that you need more help then I can offer. Good luck.
2007-05-27T07:08:00.000Z	IdleOne	jack	 I really like people who actualy believe that they are the only ones in the entire universe that the rest of us should concentrate on
2007-05-27T07:11:00.000Z	IdleOne	jack	?? meow?
2007-05-27T07:12:00.000Z	jack	IdleOne	i really wish you had a clue
2007-05-27T07:13:00.000Z	IdleOne	jack	insulting me is not going to help you. btw you seem to be the one without a clue. your behavior is going to end up getting you banned
2007-05-27T07:14:00.000Z	IdleOne	jack	I cant help you with your issue and I honestly dont want to
