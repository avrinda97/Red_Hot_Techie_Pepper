2010-04-30T07:45:00.000Z	__dantheman		or you can use diskutility
2010-04-30T07:46:00.000Z	__dantheman		atheros is a wireless adaptor
2010-04-30T07:47:00.000Z	__dantheman		the driver should be ath5k for 802.11b/g or ath9k for 802.11n
2010-04-30T07:47:00.000Z	Xgates	__dantheman	there is also a Atheros ethernet too
2010-04-30T07:48:00.000Z	Xgates	__dantheman	I need someone to search the names in Synaptic because I'm on the URL for the /pool and I can't find it, I need to download it
2010-04-30T07:49:00.000Z	__dantheman	Xgates	ok, hold on
2010-04-30T08:08:00.000Z	__dantheman	Xgates	so your wired?
2010-04-30T08:04:00.000Z	Xgates	__dantheman	you can't find Atheros in Synaptic?
2010-04-30T08:06:00.000Z	Xgates	__dantheman	AR8132
2010-04-30T08:06:00.000Z	Xgates	__dantheman	so in the search box in Synaptic if you type in atheros nothing shows up?
2010-04-30T08:08:00.000Z	Xgates	__dantheman	ahhh lsmod shows ath9k so it looks like there is mod loaded but if I do lfconfig I'm not connected
2010-04-30T08:09:00.000Z	Xgates	__dantheman	yeah I have a cat5 plugged in
2010-04-30T08:10:00.000Z	Xgates	__dantheman	no, let me check /etc/network/interfaces
2010-04-30T08:11:00.000Z	Xgates	__dantheman	yeah only lo
2010-04-30T08:12:00.000Z	Xgates	__dantheman	yeah eth0 shows now, but no address
2010-04-30T08:15:00.000Z	__dantheman	Xgates	what does it say after dhcpcd eth0
2010-04-30T08:15:00.000Z	Xgates	__dantheman	errr dhcpcd isn't installed, LOL, I'll have to download it online and then install it
2010-04-30T08:20:00.000Z	Xgates	__dantheman	yeah sudo dhclient eth0 got me up and running, but when I ran that it said that /etc/resolv.conf no such file
2010-04-30T08:31:00.000Z	Xgates	__dantheman	I forgot what's the cmd to manually load a mod?
2010-04-30T08:36:00.000Z	Xgates	__dantheman	would it be difficult for you to get the ath9k module and upload it somewhere for me?
2010-04-30T08:53:00.000Z	Xgates	__dantheman	does Ubuntu have an ncurses gui to setup the network like Debian use to have, not sure they still have, use it
