2006-07-04T07:21:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	kordo	you got ubuntu installed, right?
2006-07-04T07:36:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	kordo	if you are already familiar with windows and have no particular need to migrate, you might be better off staying with windows
2006-07-04T07:37:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	kordo	just reinstall windows, when it gets to partitioning remove everything that's not an NTFS or FAT filesystem
