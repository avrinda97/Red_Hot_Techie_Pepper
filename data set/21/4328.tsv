2008-10-26T15:35:00.000Z	msshams		hi. i want to compile an application. but when i make it, it says: http://paste.ubuntu.com/62840/ can you please help me that how can i solve this prob?
2008-10-26T15:37:00.000Z	dr_willis	msshams	 mdc_common.h:40:19: error: GL/gl.h: No such file or  looks like you need some support/developer files/libs isntalled.. and i got no idea what ones..
2008-11-02T12:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	msshams	 how big is the partition total? What filesystem is on it?
2008-11-02T12:05:00.000Z	msshams	dr_willis	210 GiB and ext3
2008-11-02T12:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	msshams	 well 5% is normally reserved for 'root, and lost+found' space.. it maybe showing that.
2008-11-02T12:08:00.000Z	msshams	dr_willis	i have 2 partition. one for / and another for my files. this partition that show 5.4 GiB used is 2nd partition. but i can't see anything on it
2008-11-02T12:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	msshams	 if ls -al , dosent show anything i would imagine it is the reserved space.
2008-11-02T12:09:00.000Z	msshams	dr_willis	when i try to ls -la i see this:
2008-11-02T12:10:00.000Z	msshams	dr_willis	can you see that it say 448 total files?
2008-11-02T12:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	msshams	 it shows 448 files but you dont see any of them by name?  thats weird.. You could just reformat the filesystem if  thers nonting you want on it.
2008-11-02T12:13:00.000Z	msshams	dr_willis	i need them files. do you have any idea?
2008-11-02T12:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	msshams	 so... you need files that are not showing up  ?
2008-11-02T12:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	msshams	 the total is the total # of K of the files it sees.. from what i can tell.. not the # of files.
2008-11-02T12:32:00.000Z	dr_willis	msshams	 you did look in the lost+found directory?
2008-11-02T12:34:00.000Z	msshams	dr_willis	http://paste.ubuntu.com/66089/
2008-11-02T12:35:00.000Z	dr_willis	msshams	 looks like you had some file system curruption - and it moved a lot of things to lost+found
2008-11-02T12:35:00.000Z	dr_willis	msshams	 explore the lost+found directory and see if you fiond any files you want to keep
2008-11-02T12:37:00.000Z	msshams	dr_willis	i see many file like that links in that folder. how can i find?
2008-11-02T12:37:00.000Z	dr_willis	msshams	 explore the directory using the shell or whatever filemanager you want..  look at the file contents
2008-11-02T12:39:00.000Z	msshams	dr_willis	that files are empty
2008-11-02T12:39:00.000Z	dr_willis	msshams	 check all of them.. i would guess one or more are what are taking up some of your space.  of course recovering them may be impossible.. but y would go thorugh eacy dierctory and look at the files and see if any seem to be worth backing up.
