2006-07-25T10:15:00.000Z	varsendaggr		someone plese help me
2006-07-25T10:16:00.000Z	varsendaggr		ahh that is it
2006-07-25T10:16:00.000Z	foobear	varsendaggr	ln -s /usr/bin/ProgramA <path-to>/ProgramA
2006-07-25T10:18:00.000Z	foobear	varsendaggr	Well, is there already a file or sym-link in /usr/bin of the name you're trying to create a new sym-link?  If so, you'll have to do something about that first.
2006-07-25T10:20:00.000Z	varsendaggr	foobear	maybe
2006-07-25T10:21:00.000Z	foobear	varsendaggr	why don't you check?  `ls -l /usr/bin/blen*
2006-07-25T10:23:00.000Z	varsendaggr	foobear	this is the newest blender
2006-07-25T10:24:00.000Z	varsendaggr	foobear	anyideas?
2006-07-25T10:25:00.000Z	foobear	varsendaggr	so you're installing from source, not a .deb package, yes?
2006-07-25T10:26:00.000Z	varsendaggr	foobear	it is a ./blender   i cd to the dir and run it from there
2006-07-25T10:28:00.000Z	foobear	varsendaggr	don't understand u.  The latest .deb package for Ubuntu is 2.41
2006-07-25T10:28:00.000Z	foobear	varsendaggr	so if you're trying to install 2.42, where'd you get it from?
2006-07-25T10:31:00.000Z	foobear	varsendaggr	 well first you'll need to unistall the official Ubuntu release with something like Synaptic, then try to compile the source you got from blender.org (assuming its source and not a binary), and compile the source via the directions most likely in a README somewhere in the top level of the source.
2006-07-25T10:32:00.000Z	varsendaggr	foobear	i have a completly different question.
2006-07-25T10:34:00.000Z	foobear	varsendaggr	could put it in your .bash_profile or .bashrc assuming you're using bash.
2006-07-25T10:34:00.000Z	foobear	varsendaggr	you're just trying to set up some system variables.  That's the easiest way to do that.
2006-07-25T10:34:00.000Z	foobear	varsendaggr	Ah...
2006-07-25T10:35:00.000Z	varsendaggr	foobear	thanks
2006-07-25T10:36:00.000Z	foobear	varsendaggr	 Create a script in a directory that's included in you $PATH.  If you call it "blender" that directory needs to exist in your path before /usr/bin does.  Best bet is to just call it something else like "myblender".  Should look something like this...
2006-07-25T10:38:00.000Z	varsendaggr	foobear	thankyou
