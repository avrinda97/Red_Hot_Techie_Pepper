2005-09-08T13:09:00.000Z	Blissex	seife	thats not clear, but probably it is not difficult.
2005-09-08T13:09:00.000Z	Blissex	seife	try to be more precise as to what you want to achieve. Ask a specific question.
2005-09-08T13:33:00.000Z	Blissex	seife	consider reading http://tinyurl.com/bz8v4 on how to ask questions
2005-10-09T13:28:00.000Z	Blissex	seife	which drivers? As a rule there are some that are already included.
2005-10-09T13:29:00.000Z	Blissex	seife	if you don't care about 3D acceleration, use the 'radeon' drivers just like that. If you case, consider the proprietary 'fglrx' drivers or the 'radeon' driver plus DRI.
2005-10-09T13:30:00.000Z	Blissex	seife	the 'radeon' driver is included with X; the 'fglrx' driver is in a special repository, and there is an HOWTO in the Ubuntu Wiki about binary only drivers
2005-10-09T13:31:00.000Z	seife	Blissex	 can i download that fglrx with synaptic?
2005-10-09T13:31:00.000Z	Blissex	seife	yes, as described in the Binary Driver pages in the Ubuntu Wiki, which is easy to find.
2005-10-09T13:32:00.000Z	Blissex	seife	but note that the 7500 is well supported by 'radeon' and 'dri', which are more reliable than 'fglrx' even if a bit slower.
2005-10-09T13:36:00.000Z	Blissex	seife	almost surely because you dont have the MP3 decoders which are semi proprietary.
2005-10-09T13:36:00.000Z	seife	Blissex	where can i get that mp3 decoders?
2005-10-09T13:36:00.000Z	Blissex	seife	however, some sordid characters have made available packags with the right decoders. It is in the Ubuntu Wiki where
2005-10-09T13:37:00.000Z	Blissex	seife	it is in the Ubuntu Wiki... :-)
2005-10-21T12:14:00.000Z	Blissex	seife	perhaps you should study how the sound syste works...
2005-10-21T12:15:00.000Z	seife	Blissex	ive studied
2005-10-21T12:15:00.000Z	Blissex	seife	look at the troubleshooting section of http://tinyurl.com/4ogk2
2005-10-21T12:15:00.000Z	Blissex	seife	in particular how to select the default device, or a device at all.
2005-10-21T12:20:00.000Z	Blissex	seife	use the 'snd-usb-audio; driver.
