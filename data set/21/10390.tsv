2007-03-19T14:00:00.000Z	billy	cwillu	 check out the "root" line of the Microsoft title. Shouldn't there be a ")" after "(hd0,0"?
2007-03-19T14:00:00.000Z	cwillu	billy	 :)
2007-03-19T14:02:00.000Z	billy	cwillu	curious.  why gksudo?  never really understood the difference?
2007-03-19T14:02:00.000Z	cwillu	billy	it can break in some circumstances, handles x auth better I think
2007-03-19T14:03:00.000Z	cwillu	billy	I usually just use sudo (command line password is more convenient), but occasionally it breaks in weird and wonderful ways, but gksudo still works
2007-03-19T14:03:00.000Z	billy	cwillu	ah.  because using gedit, perhaps?
2007-03-19T14:03:00.000Z	cwillu	billy	x stuff in general
2007-03-19T14:03:00.000Z	billy	cwillu	 right on.  i like nano nowadays.
2007-03-19T14:04:00.000Z	billy	cwillu	 that'd be convenient.  I understand there are alternatives to nautilus which have a "edit as root" right click option.
2007-03-19T14:05:00.000Z	cwillu	billy	there's extensions to nautilus that does it (easy to set up)
2007-03-19T14:05:00.000Z	cwillu	billy	I think the biggest problem with the gedit auto-sudo would be determining what access you actually need
2007-03-19T14:08:00.000Z	billy	cwillu	well, as a recovering 'doze user, i think i'll just stick to the CL as much as possible, just for that extra nerdy feelin'.  :)
2007-03-19T14:08:00.000Z	cwillu	billy	I'm sure you can find a script to reconfig a wrt via command line
2007-03-19T14:09:00.000Z	cwillu	billy	in fact, you should consider installing your own linux on it;  there's easy to use firmwares for that :p
2007-03-19T14:09:00.000Z	billy	cwillu	uh ... i think you lost me.  remember ... recovering 'doze user here.  :D
2007-03-19T14:10:00.000Z	cwillu	billy	you can install linux on a wrt54 :p
2007-03-19T14:11:00.000Z	cwillu	billy	oops, I think I'm crossing my conversations :p
2007-03-19T14:11:00.000Z	billy	cwillu	ok.  i was wondering.  :)
2007-03-19T14:21:00.000Z	cwillu	billy	depends on how it's copyrighted, but in general :p
2007-03-19T14:24:00.000Z	billy	cwillu	billy = democracy?  ANATHEMA!!
2007-03-19T14:37:00.000Z	billy	cwillu	I tried that in my case.   Didn't work.  Maybe Audio_1's case will be different.
