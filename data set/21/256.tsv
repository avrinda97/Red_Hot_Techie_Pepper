2012-11-21T23:56:00.000Z	brightsparks		ok I unplugged the usb cable and reconnected and now the device has mounted successfully...
2012-11-21T23:58:00.000Z	brightsparks		ok I can see the picture files on the camera media card but I am unable to transfer them to my computer - unspecified error message but previously I had an error message saying that I didn't have permission to move the files.

2012-11-22T00:19:00.000Z	bobweaver	brightsparks	 yeah it says that there is nothing in there
2012-11-22T00:21:00.000Z	brightsparks	bobweaver	er...what does that mean bob? Like I said I have mounted the visible camera and media and can see the files but can't transfer them to a folder on my computer ??
2012-11-22T00:23:00.000Z	brightsparks	bobweaver	as a matter of interest if I take the media card out of the camera and put it using a reader into the computer I can copy the pictures on the computer but then when I put the card back in the camera the pictures have all been erased and  have to reformat the card
2012-11-22T00:23:00.000Z	bobweaver	brightsparks	 I am sorry but in you past all I see is nothing
2012-11-22T00:24:00.000Z	bobweaver	brightsparks	 I am not the best at media cards TBH maybe someone else can help
2012-11-22T00:24:00.000Z	brightsparks	bobweaver	ok thanks anyway
2012-11-22T00:25:00.000Z	brightsparks	bobweaver	I was also hoping there might be a terminal command I could use that would give me absolute control of what I am seeing there and move stuff around without getting resistance
