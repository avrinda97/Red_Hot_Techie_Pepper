2006-06-06T06:51:00.000Z	UzzaDead		personal experience :)
2006-06-06T06:53:00.000Z	freezer	UzzaDead	why should it be bad if the power supply fan blows the hot air out?
2006-06-06T06:54:00.000Z	UzzaDead	freezer	because in most cases it creates a vacuum and no air goes through the fins resulting in a higher temperature
2006-06-06T06:55:00.000Z	freezer	UzzaDead	this case really suxx, power supply is 1cm over the cpu fan and covers it ~50%....
