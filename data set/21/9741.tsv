2006-06-17T13:46:00.000Z	ulaas		hi, how do i change console resolution to higher values to get native on my LCD ?
2006-06-17T13:46:00.000Z	ulaas		grub?
2006-06-17T13:47:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	ulaas	you need to edit your /boot/grub/menu.lst file
2006-06-17T13:48:00.000Z	ulaas	Samus_Aran	i thought so.. how ? :)
2006-06-17T13:49:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	ulaas	what bitdepth and resolution are you after ?
2006-06-17T13:50:00.000Z	ulaas	Samus_Aran	dont care for the depth. i need 1280x800
2006-06-17T13:51:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	ulaas	that is an odd resolution.  I don't think you will be able to get that in standard vesa modes
2006-06-17T13:52:00.000Z	ulaas	Samus_Aran	do you have any links in mind or should i play holmes on google? either way thanks. ;)
2006-06-17T13:52:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	ulaas	I can pastebin.com you the standard vesa modes, to be used in your grub.conf
2006-06-17T13:53:00.000Z	ulaas	Samus_Aran	that may help! thanx
2006-06-17T13:53:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	ulaas	but it only has the normal modes: 640x480  |  800x600  | 1024x768  | 1280x1024
2006-06-17T13:53:00.000Z	ulaas	Samus_Aran	lemme try maybe they will do good for me

2006-06-17T13:54:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	ulaas	if you have your kernel source or documentation installed, you can read /usr/src/linux/Documentation/framebuffer or something like that
2006-06-17T13:55:00.000Z	ulaas	Samus_Aran	deal. thanx
2006-06-17T13:57:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	ulaas	you put those hex values in your kernel config as vga=<blah>
2006-06-17T13:57:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	ulaas	e.g. vga=0x305
2006-06-17T13:57:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	ulaas	just make sure you don't replace your default kernel with it, just copy one of your kernel entries in the menu.lst file .. then you can try it, and if it doesn't work, just reboot and go back to the old menu entry
2006-06-17T13:58:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	ulaas	add it to the end of the "kernel" line
2006-06-17T13:58:00.000Z	ulaas	Samus_Aran	you are the man. ;)
2006-06-17T13:59:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	ulaas	various graphics cards and monitors/screens will support various other modes than those standard ones.  you can just experiment with other numbers and see what comes up
