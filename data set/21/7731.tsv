2010-02-01T04:51:00.000Z	tgraham		I have a fresh 8.10 server install. I created an account during the install, but every time I try to log in it says Login incorrect. What am I doing wrong?
2010-02-01T04:52:00.000Z	tgraham		Nope
2010-02-01T04:52:00.000Z	tgraham		I've reinstalled 3 time, each time, same problem.
2010-02-01T04:52:00.000Z	tgraham		Console, through VMWare.
2010-02-01T04:53:00.000Z	tgraham		The user I created during the install process.
2010-02-01T04:54:00.000Z	tgraham		I've done that, then tried a passwd to change the users password, but still no go.
2010-02-01T04:55:00.000Z	tgraham		Minimal install on the guided partion.
2010-02-01T04:56:00.000Z	tgraham		Let me check those.
2010-02-01T04:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tgraham	8.10 server?  that's what you put
2010-02-01T04:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tgraham	uhmm that will run out of support at the end of April
2010-02-01T04:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tgraham	8.04 is LTS  not 8.10
2010-02-01T04:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tgraham	10.04 is next LTS.   ,but your doing server OS in virtual machines?
2010-02-01T04:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tgraham	what's your actsaul host OS?
2010-02-01T04:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tgraham	and why are you doing Ubuntu in a server machine?   ESX4 uhmm that sounds like the virtual machine software, not the actsaul operating system it's running on
2010-02-01T04:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tgraham	why are you doing server in a virtual machine, above?
2010-02-01T04:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tgraham	8.04 server that makes sense,  8.10  not really when it's on the verge of running out of support.
2010-02-01T05:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tgraham	#vmware for vmware product help
2010-02-01T05:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tgraham	#ubuntu-server for server edition help
2010-02-01T05:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tgraham	have you tried 8.04?
2010-02-01T05:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tgraham	that's the one you should be trying now, 8.10 will run out of support in April
2010-02-01T05:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tgraham	or  maybe May
