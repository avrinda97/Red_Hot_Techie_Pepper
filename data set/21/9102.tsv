2005-11-10T09:33:00.000Z	vorpulus		maybe I'll just leave the computer on forever now
2005-11-10T09:33:00.000Z	vorpulus		have you ever had any problems at start up mustard5 ?
2005-11-10T09:35:00.000Z	vorpulus		I've seen i386 and i586
2005-11-10T09:35:00.000Z	vorpulus		I'm trying to pretend I know what you're talking about.
2005-11-10T09:35:00.000Z	vorpulus		I'm such a novice it's untrue
2005-11-10T09:36:00.000Z	vorpulus		I see
2005-11-10T09:36:00.000Z	vorpulus		Oh that brings me on to another thing
2005-11-10T09:36:00.000Z	vorpulus		I have an ATi Radeon 9200 graphics card
2005-11-10T09:36:00.000Z	vorpulus		and did some research on google, and it seems ATi don't make very good drivers for linux
2005-11-10T09:37:00.000Z	vorpulus		cheers.
2005-11-10T09:37:00.000Z	erUSUL	vorpulus	very nice card. i own one too. the only graphic cards with an opensource 3d acc driver
2005-11-10T09:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	vorpulus	i use the free radeon driver. less performance but less trubles with upgrades and the like
2005-11-10T09:39:00.000Z	erUSUL	vorpulus	try a sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and choose radeon instead of ati for the driver
2005-11-10T09:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	vorpulus	mustard5 if he's going to use the radeon driver he do not need to install the fglrx one
2005-11-10T09:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	vorpulus	mustard5 radeon comes installed by default try 'man radeon'
2005-11-10T09:44:00.000Z	vorpulus	erUSUL	does that mean that drivers for my card are already installed?
2005-11-10T10:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	vorpulus	are you using sudo?
2005-11-10T10:04:00.000Z	vorpulus	erUSUL	that could be it, thanks
2005-11-10T10:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	vorpulus	cd /dir and then sh WineCVS.sh
2005-11-10T10:24:00.000Z	vorpulus	erUSUL	I used sudo apt-get install wine
2005-11-10T10:24:00.000Z	vorpulus	erUSUL	where would that put it?
