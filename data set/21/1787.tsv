2010-04-30T10:42:00.000Z	zen--	KeithGS	try right clicking on the flash object (im assuming its in browser) and there should be some settings to play with
2010-04-30T10:43:00.000Z	KeithGS	zen--	flash10 + linux == broke, so I had to go to the settings manager, and "always allow"
2010-04-30T10:43:00.000Z	zen--	KeithGS	it deffinatly is
2010-04-30T10:54:00.000Z	zen--	KeithGS	well the first step would be to get flash working :P
2010-04-30T10:55:00.000Z	KeithGS	zen--	flash does work.
2010-04-30T10:55:00.000Z	zen--	KeithGS	i feel your pain, a long time ago (i forgot the process) but i was able to get my webcam workign with stickam and tinychat
2010-04-30T10:55:00.000Z	zen--	KeithGS	ooo
2010-04-30T10:55:00.000Z	zen--	KeithGS	let me see if i can refresh my memory
2010-04-30T10:56:00.000Z	KeithGS	zen--	the little "broadcast preview" on tinychat I see myself, but when I enter the room with my cam, the cam shuts off.
2010-04-30T10:56:00.000Z	zen--	KeithGS	did you setup your video device? /dev/video0 etc...
2010-04-30T10:56:00.000Z	KeithGS	zen--	skype; webcam studio and everything shows me perfectly.
2010-04-30T10:57:00.000Z	zen--	KeithGS	did you give the site permission to use your cam? i remember doing somethign with this page http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager04.html
2010-04-30T10:58:00.000Z	zen--	KeithGS	thats weird you said the video prevew works as well right?
2010-04-30T10:59:00.000Z	zen--	KeithGS	maybe that actual flash applet is using a different domain?
2010-04-30T10:59:00.000Z	zen--	KeithGS	other than that i have no idea
2010-04-30T10:59:00.000Z	zen--	KeithGS	dotn give up though sounds like your close to solving your problem
2010-04-30T11:00:00.000Z	zen--	KeithGS	there really isnt much ubuntu or linux can do about retarded shit like that, its all the manufactures shit
2010-04-30T11:01:00.000Z	zen--	KeithGS	need to start writing drivers for linux so there cam can work out of the box
