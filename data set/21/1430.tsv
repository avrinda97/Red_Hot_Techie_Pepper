2010-09-20T10:05:00.000Z	ziroday	at05gt	its a gnome-panel applet, there is no separate executable/package
2010-09-20T10:07:00.000Z	at05gt	ziroday	but if i shut down gnome panel to fix it i lose all my bars dont i?
2010-09-20T10:07:00.000Z	ziroday	at05gt	what exactly is wrong?
2010-09-20T10:08:00.000Z	at05gt	ziroday	the clock on the bar is frozen to 2 hours ago
2010-09-20T10:08:00.000Z	ziroday	at05gt	okay, try "killall gnome-panel"
2010-09-20T10:08:00.000Z	at05gt	ziroday	wont i lose my bars?
2010-09-20T10:08:00.000Z	ziroday	at05gt	they should automatically restart
2010-09-20T10:09:00.000Z	at05gt		alright ill try it
2010-09-20T10:09:00.000Z	at05gt	ziroday	ok that fixed it but how do i get them to stay in the order i want, when i log in, on bar is always out of place and i have to reorder them
2010-09-20T10:10:00.000Z	ziroday	at05gt	that is somewhat harder, have you tried putting them in order and then right clicking and selecting "lock in position"?
2010-09-20T10:10:00.000Z	at05gt		i have no option to lock the actual bars
2010-09-20T10:10:00.000Z	at05gt		just the items on them
2010-09-20T10:12:00.000Z	ziroday	at05gt	correct
2010-09-20T10:12:00.000Z	at05gt	ziroday	ya im not talking about the items switching places, when i log in the actual bars are not in the same place as when i logged out
2010-09-20T10:12:00.000Z	at05gt	ziroday	i have 3 running an i have them in a specific order
2010-09-20T10:13:00.000Z	ziroday	at05gt	ah, well I'm not sure about that sorry
2010-09-20T10:14:00.000Z	at05gt	ziroday	kk thanks for the help with the frozen clock
