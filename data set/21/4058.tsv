2008-10-26T02:25:00.000Z	KenBW22		anyone know a way to ssh to a remote desktop which has a firewalled router with no port forwarding?
2008-10-26T02:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	KenBW22	if its behind  arouter an there is no port forwarding it will require hacking the roter
2008-10-26T02:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	KenBW22	unless remote config is enabled
2008-10-26T02:26:00.000Z	KenBW22	ActionParsnip	please elaborate
2008-10-26T02:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	KenBW22	routers are firewalls by the fact that unexpectd packets are dropped due to the nature of nat
2008-10-26T02:28:00.000Z	KenBW22	ActionParsnip	i meant about the remote config
2008-10-26T02:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	KenBW22	so unless you have have remote config enable so you can turn it on, any data recieved on port 22 will be dropped
2008-10-26T02:29:00.000Z	KenBW22	ActionParsnip	whats this remote config you speak off?
2008-10-26T02:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	KenBW22	you cant turn on remote config so you can configure the router from the wan side, rather than LAN, this is off by default and is massively unsecure
2008-10-26T02:29:00.000Z	KenBW22	ActionParsnip	oh, thaat wouldnt help
2008-10-26T02:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	KenBW22	the config via web browser is only accessible via LAN
2008-10-26T02:30:00.000Z	KenBW22	ActionParsnip	the problem is that ive lost the routers password and need the existing settings
2008-10-26T02:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	KenBW22	but you CAN enable it but its a REALLY bad choixce
2008-10-26T02:30:00.000Z	KenBW22	ActionParsnip	what does it involve (i dont think ill do it but just to have a loo)
2008-10-26T02:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	KenBW22	then you'll need to find the default pass if you havent changed it
2008-10-26T02:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	KenBW22	or you can hard reset it on the unit and reset it up
2008-10-26T02:31:00.000Z	KenBW22	ActionParsnip	thats the problem - i dont know the password, and dont want to lose the settongs on it
2009-10-19T16:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	KenBW22	depends how they are seen to ubuntu, if the inbox is simply a file, you can copy iy
2009-10-19T16:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	KenBW22	it will vary wildly so you will have to investigate whats what first
2009-10-19T16:24:00.000Z	KenBW22	ActionParsnip	I can use Wammu for backing up the messages but it doesn't transfer the dats and times - only for the inbox
2009-10-19T16:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	KenBW22	its not something I do tbh
