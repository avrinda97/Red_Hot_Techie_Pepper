2005-12-26T09:54:00.000Z	senthil	bimberi	i tried this steps already but its not working ;-(
2005-12-26T09:55:00.000Z	bimberi	senthil	ok, what do you mean by "can access"? read-only? read-but-not-write?
2005-12-26T09:57:00.000Z	senthil	bimberi	I can read and write my windows Fat32 file system but not NTFS
2005-12-26T09:57:00.000Z	bimberi	senthil	ntfs is read-only
2005-12-26T09:57:00.000Z	senthil	bimberi	For NTFS Filesystem its not even open
2005-12-26T09:57:00.000Z	senthil	bimberi	i knew NTFS is read only
2005-12-26T09:58:00.000Z	bimberi	senthil	ok, so it's not mounting?
2005-12-26T09:58:00.000Z	senthil	bimberi	but i'm not even able to read.
2005-12-26T09:58:00.000Z	senthil	bimberi	Its mounted when i attempt to open the mounted NTFS partition it opened Fat32 filesystem
2005-12-26T09:59:00.000Z	bimberi	senthil	wow, ok - put the output from "mount" on a pastebin ...
