2005-07-12T11:34:00.000Z	nickrud		Barney make sure that there is no xorg.conf in /etc/X11
2005-07-12T11:35:00.000Z	nickrud		hah, us repository problems
2005-07-12T11:35:00.000Z	nickrud		Barney sudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2005-07-12T11:36:00.000Z	nickrud		Barney then, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg should work, it creates the file from scratch
2005-07-12T11:38:00.000Z	nickrud		Barney hm. That problem is not one I've never seen.
2005-07-12T11:39:00.000Z	nickrud		Barney if no one steps up here in the next few, I'd ask on the ubuntu-users mailling list.
2005-07-12T11:40:00.000Z	nickrud		Barney reinstalls are nearly never needed.
2005-07-12T11:41:00.000Z	nickrud		aptitude is the greatest thing since sliced bread
2005-07-12T11:42:00.000Z	The_Vox	nickrud	it's actually the reason why I moved from mandriva (I've used it since 5.3...and still have a few boxes with it) to a debian-based distro...the mdv people never listened to me when I told them that we needed an aptitude-like thing
2005-07-12T11:44:00.000Z	nickrud	The_Vox	you need apt before you can get aptitude :)
2005-07-12T11:45:00.000Z	The_Vox	nickrud	I said aptitude-like :) Just like they did with urpmi by doing apt one better, they should have done an aptitude one better...but nobody was interested, and I am not a coder, unfortunately
2005-07-12T11:48:00.000Z	nickrud	The_Vox	I was really suprised to see in the debian release notes for sarge that apt-get was depreciated, and aptitude recommended.
2005-07-12T11:50:00.000Z	The_Vox	nickrud	didn't know that...but doesn't surprise me...aptitude has a better way to handle broken packages/updates (don't ask me specifics...I was told this 3 years ago and I've been using kubuntu for 4 days :)
2005-07-12T11:51:00.000Z	nickrud	The_Vox	it is better, you can easily put things on hold, select different versions from different repositories, etc. Really fine grained control.
2005-07-12T11:51:00.000Z	The_Vox	nickrud	yup...tho I still need to find out how to make it tell me what repo something is from :)
2005-07-12T11:52:00.000Z	nickrud	The_Vox	me too ;(
2005-07-12T11:59:00.000Z	nickrud	The_Vox	/var/log/Xorg.0.log :)
2005-07-12T11:59:00.000Z	The_Vox	nickrud	the problem with bash-completion is that you never learn the name of the damn files lol!
2005-07-12T12:00:00.000Z	nickrud	The_Vox	yeah, I do a quick check for files before posting normally, but that one rolls off my fingertips now ;)
2005-07-12T12:01:00.000Z	The_Vox	nickrud	hehehe
2005-07-23T05:48:00.000Z	The_Vox	nickrud	thanks for that tip, didn't know it either :)
