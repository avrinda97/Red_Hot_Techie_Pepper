2005-12-11T06:33:00.000Z	victor		that's strange as well, it reboots perfectly, but it doesn't halt
2005-12-11T06:35:00.000Z	victor		yes, i can halt it by pressing the button, and it reboots without checking anything
2005-12-11T06:36:00.000Z	victor		sorry? i don't understand that
2005-12-11T06:36:00.000Z	victor		linux can't shut down the pc
2005-12-11T06:36:00.000Z	victor		i can manually
2005-12-11T06:36:00.000Z	victor		windows also can
2005-12-11T06:36:00.000Z	victor		and linux was able to some days ago
2005-12-11T06:38:00.000Z	victor		by manually i mean using the power button lol
2005-12-11T06:38:00.000Z	victor		tell me
2005-12-11T06:39:00.000Z	victor		haha i'll try
2005-12-11T06:39:00.000Z	frogzo1	victor	maybe check /var/log/messages ?
2005-12-11T06:40:00.000Z	victor	frogzo1	i didn't i'll do right now
2005-12-11T06:40:00.000Z	frogzo1	victor	grub's got nothing to do with it - once grub kicks off the kernel, it's all down to linux
2005-12-11T06:45:00.000Z	victor	frogzo1	this is what my /var/log/messages says
2005-12-11T06:45:00.000Z	frogzo1	victor	pastebin pls
2005-12-11T06:46:00.000Z	frogzo1	victor	the last fifty lines prior to the last boot
2005-12-11T06:52:00.000Z	victor	frogzo1	is there any bot with common help?
2005-12-11T06:56:00.000Z	frogzo1	victor	can be done - there's an option for fstab (racks brains....)
2005-12-11T06:59:00.000Z	frogzo1	victor	my guess is that gnome isn't shutting down cleanly - a reinstall might be a good plan, or just mv aside your .gconf and .gconfd directories & logout/login
2005-12-11T06:59:00.000Z	victor	frogzo1	yeah i thought about a reinstall..
2005-12-11T06:59:00.000Z	frogzo1	victor	reinstall of gnome that is, but try moving aside the directories first
