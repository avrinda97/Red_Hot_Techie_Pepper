2008-10-05T23:54:00.000Z	Scunizi		All right I'll ask a question.. desktop xchat works fine but my install on my lappy.. when I hit "X" to close/minimize it asks if I just want to put it on the panel (minimize) and if it should do this all the time for that action.. I choose yes.. yet it doesn't save the option and closes it the next time.. any ideas?
2008-10-05T23:54:00.000Z	lucax	Scunizi	try choosing another metacity theme or emerald
2008-10-05T23:55:00.000Z	Scunizi	lucax	it's clearlooks.. pretty standard but I'll give it a shot on the next boot of the machine.
2008-10-05T23:55:00.000Z	Scunizi	lucax	I've always had issues with emerald for some reason..
