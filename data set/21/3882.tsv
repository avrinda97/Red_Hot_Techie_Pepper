2008-09-05T00:46:00.000Z	dGodFatheR		please i really need to copy a file over the ssh connection
2008-09-05T00:46:00.000Z	dGodFatheR		actually it's a dir
2008-09-05T00:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	dGodFatheR	scp ?
2008-09-05T00:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	dGodFatheR	scp your_username@remotehost.xxx:foobar.txt /some/local/directory
2008-09-05T00:49:00.000Z	erUSUL	dGodFatheR	rsync is averkill for a single file
2008-09-05T00:49:00.000Z	erUSUL	dGodFatheR	rsync is overkill for a single file
2008-09-05T00:52:00.000Z	dGodFatheR	erUSUL	i am not moving a single file, as i wrote i need a full directory
2008-09-05T00:53:00.000Z	dGodFatheR	erUSUL	but now i noticed, that the scp is stalled
2008-09-05T00:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	dGodFatheR	you wrote user@remoteIp:/path/to/file <<<
2008-09-05T00:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	dGodFatheR	so i missunderstood
2008-09-05T00:53:00.000Z	dGodFatheR	erUSUL	yes
2008-09-05T00:54:00.000Z	dGodFatheR	erUSUL	i am getting a stalled status in shell for scp on a single file
2008-09-05T00:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	dGodFatheR	dunno what is wrong ...
2008-09-05T21:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	dGodFatheR	you haven't created one and none has done it for you
2008-09-05T21:59:00.000Z	dGodFatheR	erUSUL	?
2008-09-05T22:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	dGodFatheR	the file does not exist becouse it is not there by default you have to create it yourself if you need it
2008-09-05T22:01:00.000Z	dGodFatheR	erUSUL	in that case how do i know what should be written in it, and how
2008-09-05T22:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	dGodFatheR	if you do not know what should be written in it you do not need it
2008-09-05T22:04:00.000Z	dGodFatheR	erUSUL	i do need it because i need to edit the default settings for my xterm
2008-09-05T22:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	dGodFatheR	see an example http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~ahb/laptop_setup/Xresources
2008-09-05T22:08:00.000Z	dGodFatheR	erUSUL	thanks
