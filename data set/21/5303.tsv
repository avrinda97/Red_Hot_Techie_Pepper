2007-11-15T23:08:00.000Z	thigo	ikonia	but 64 or 32 bits version?
2007-11-15T23:08:00.000Z	ikonia	thigo	your choice, 32 is easier for the average user
2007-11-15T23:09:00.000Z	ikonia	thigo	some are 32 bit some are 64 bit
2007-11-15T23:09:00.000Z	ikonia	thigo	don't ask the same question multiple times
2007-11-15T23:09:00.000Z	ikonia	thigo	look at the model number
2007-11-15T23:10:00.000Z	ikonia	thigo	just use the 32bit version - you'll have no reason to use 64bit
2007-11-15T23:11:00.000Z	ikonia	thigo	no
2007-11-15T23:12:00.000Z	ikonia	thigo	look at your cpu model number or speak to the manufacturer
2007-11-15T23:13:00.000Z	ikonia	thigo	cat /proc/cpuinfo
2007-11-15T23:14:00.000Z	ikonia	thigo	ok so is a T5500 64bit ?
2007-11-15T23:14:00.000Z	ikonia	thigo	it doesn't matter, use 32bit !
2007-11-15T23:15:00.000Z	ikonia	thigo	use the 32bit os
2007-11-15T23:16:00.000Z	ikonia	thigo	just use the 32bit OS
2007-11-15T23:16:00.000Z	ikonia	thigo	then mail sony
2007-11-15T23:22:00.000Z	ikonia	thigo	use 32 bit
2007-11-15T23:30:00.000Z	ikonia	thigo	just use the 32bit version !
2007-11-15T23:30:00.000Z	ikonia	thigo	you have no reason to use 64bit
2007-11-15T23:30:00.000Z	ikonia	thigo	you will get NO benifit from it
2007-11-15T23:31:00.000Z	ikonia	thigo	it doesn't matter why - just use 32bit - it will offer you no performance increase
