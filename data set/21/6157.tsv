2007-06-15T12:22:00.000Z	aMMuNix		is ubuntu blocking any ports? cause opening ports in my router doesn't do anything
2007-06-15T12:23:00.000Z	aMMuNix		above?
2007-06-15T12:25:00.000Z	slytherin	aMMuNix	try installing firestarter and open the port for bittorent
2007-06-15T12:26:00.000Z	aMMuNix	slytherin	no such thing for gnome?
2007-06-15T12:26:00.000Z	slytherin	aMMuNix	WHAT?
2007-06-15T12:26:00.000Z	aMMuNix	slytherin	nevermind, forget it, :D
2007-06-15T12:27:00.000Z	aMMuNix	slytherin	got stupid for a sec
2007-06-15T12:31:00.000Z	aMMuNix	slytherin	where can I define ports in firestarter?
2007-06-15T12:32:00.000Z	slytherin	aMMuNix	Do you see policy tab?
2007-06-15T12:33:00.000Z	slytherin	aMMuNix	In 'Allow Service' right click and say 'Add Rule'
2007-06-15T12:33:00.000Z	aMMuNix	slytherin	thanks :)
2007-06-15T12:34:00.000Z	aMMuNix	slytherin	didn't work :(
2007-06-15T12:35:00.000Z	aMMuNix	slytherin	the port is still closed (atleast according to www.canyouseeme.org)
2007-06-15T12:38:00.000Z	aMMuNix	slytherin	that didn't help, port is still closed
2007-06-15T12:39:00.000Z	slytherin	aMMuNix	Did you apply the policy?
2007-06-15T12:39:00.000Z	aMMuNix	slytherin	are you sure ubuntu itself isn't blocking ports too?
2007-06-15T12:40:00.000Z	slytherin	aMMuNix	If they are opened up in firestarter then they should not be blocking
2007-06-15T12:40:00.000Z	aMMuNix	slytherin	well then it just might be a problem with my router I'll check, thanks
2007-06-15T12:42:00.000Z	aMMuNix	slytherin	it worked nevermind
2007-06-15T12:43:00.000Z	aMMuNix	slytherin	thanks
