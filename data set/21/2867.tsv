2010-08-04T21:57:00.000Z	hdtdi		if i am a normal user on a ubuntu box with quota, how can i check how much quota i have left?
2010-08-04T21:58:00.000Z	sipior	hdtdi	try "quota" at a prompt
2010-08-04T21:59:00.000Z	hdtdi	sipior	quota tries to open quota.user, but quota.user is with 600 permissions. a normal user cant read
2010-08-04T22:00:00.000Z	sipior	hdtdi	try "quota <username>"
2010-08-04T22:01:00.000Z	hdtdi	sipior	its the same... i am performing this with normal user not with root
2010-08-04T22:01:00.000Z	sipior	hdtdi	complain to your system administrator; the machine is configured poorly :-)
2010-08-04T22:01:00.000Z	hdtdi		i am the system administrator :D
2010-08-04T22:01:00.000Z	sipior	hdtdi	well, that makes it faster for you
2010-08-04T22:02:00.000Z	hdtdi	sipior	with su i can see quota user but i want if i have a user and he wants to see how much quota he have.. ? then what?
2010-08-04T22:03:00.000Z	sipior	hdtdi	is making the file readable not an option?
2010-08-04T22:04:00.000Z	hdtdi	sipior	well.. i am watching some LPIC sert and the guy there said - you MUST change the permissions to 600
2010-08-04T22:05:00.000Z	sipior	hdtdi	and did he say why?
2010-08-04T22:05:00.000Z	hdtdi		well i guess security measure but he didnt say that
2010-08-04T22:07:00.000Z	sipior	hdtdi	does "quota -v" work for you?
2010-08-04T22:07:00.000Z	hdtdi		nope
2010-08-04T22:07:00.000Z	hdtdi		well i guess if its ro only for the root i cant see with normal user
2010-08-04T22:08:00.000Z	sipior	hdtdi	i assumed quota would be suid root.
2010-08-04T22:22:00.000Z	hdtdi	sipior	a its ok now :) i dont know really how but with user i can see just my own quota :)
2010-08-04T22:22:00.000Z	sipior	hdtdi	what did you change, out of curiosity?
2010-08-04T22:23:00.000Z	hdtdi		well i dont know i wrote the mount options in the fstab, remount the partition and then it was ok
2010-08-04T22:23:00.000Z	sipior	hdtdi	oh well, that makes sense
