2007-12-08T20:23:00.000Z	foobar	jim288	just kind of suspect the source.list is corrupted or something. Not really sure...
2007-12-08T20:24:00.000Z	foobar	jim288	or at least one of the repo is corrupted.
2007-12-08T20:25:00.000Z	jim288	foobar	Got now idea what this means http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/47383/
2007-12-08T20:26:00.000Z	foobar	jim288	this is the list of software packages that have been installed in your OS.

2007-12-08T20:30:00.000Z	foobar	jim288	ok, can you open /etc/apt/sources.list ?
2007-12-08T20:39:00.000Z	foobar	jim288	can u try to comment out line 53?
2007-12-08T20:42:00.000Z	foobar	jim288	well, you just open /etc/apt/sources.list, and comment out line 53, meaning you put this // in front of that line
2007-12-08T20:46:00.000Z	foobar	jim288	can you open synaptic pkg mnger now?
2007-12-08T20:47:00.000Z	jim288	foobar	nope, I was supposed to write // in fron right
2007-12-08T20:48:00.000Z	foobar	jim288	yup, you need to prepend line 53 with //, and save that file then.
2007-12-08T20:51:00.000Z	foobar	jim288	alrite, you can delete the whole line then
