2011-05-08T14:52:00.000Z	antoinefr		Hello.. please.. i installed the last version of ubuntu. Got a SATTELITE L30-105 with wifi card "Atheros Communications Inc. AR2413 802.11bg NIC". Network stops working randomly.. I find nothing on internet.. :(
2011-05-08T14:53:00.000Z	sevoxx	antoinefr	Don't use WiFi. Problem sorted.
2011-05-08T14:53:00.000Z	antoinefr	sevoxx	can you give me more informations please ?
2011-05-08T14:54:00.000Z	antoinefr		no
2011-05-08T14:54:00.000Z	sevoxx	antoinefr	I had similar issues a while back. I'd tell you it's broadcast strength issues, but I don't know myself. My problem was that the Access Point wasn't sending waves at a strong enough range.
2011-05-08T14:55:00.000Z	antoinefr	sevoxx	fully working on Win7
2011-05-08T14:55:00.000Z	sevoxx	antoinefr	does your WiFi card support 802.11 b and g?
2011-05-08T14:56:00.000Z	antoinefr	sevoxx	"AR2413 802.11bg" so.. "bg" yes?
2011-05-08T14:56:00.000Z	sevoxx		Hmm right.
2011-05-08T14:56:00.000Z	sevoxx		Set it to 'b' only. See if that works.
2011-05-08T14:56:00.000Z	sevoxx		'b' is longer range
2011-05-08T14:56:00.000Z	antoinefr		how i can make that please sevoxx ?
2011-05-08T14:57:00.000Z	sevoxx		Go to the properties of your network card, click the 'driver' tab and it will be under proerties
2011-05-08T14:57:00.000Z	sevoxx		properties*
2011-05-08T14:58:00.000Z	antoinefr	sevoxx	scuse me.. i can find this on networking manager ?
2011-05-08T14:58:00.000Z	sevoxx	antoinefr	It's a little hard to help you out with Windows right now. I'm on Ubuntu 11.04 at the moment.
2011-05-08T15:00:00.000Z	sevoxx	antoinefr	does it disconnect while you are using the pc?
2011-05-08T15:00:00.000Z	antoinefr	sevoxx	its very strange. im connecting throw ssh connection now to talk via weechat and its work..
2011-05-08T15:00:00.000Z	antoinefr		but if i use http protocol.. randomly stop loading of page
2011-05-08T15:01:00.000Z	sevoxx		So you don't literally get disconnected from the network? It just times out?
2011-05-08T15:02:00.000Z	antoinefr	sevoxx	like now : no response on http when i try to ask different website from chromium or firefox but i can tchat with you from a ssh connexion wich dont stop
