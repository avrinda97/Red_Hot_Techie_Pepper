2007-08-17T05:40:00.000Z	morodock_	vanberge	synergy rocks!
2007-08-17T05:40:00.000Z	vanberge	morodock_	i heard about it... and i installed it... but im stuck a bit on using it!
2007-08-17T05:41:00.000Z	vanberge	morodock_	you have to mess with your xorg config?
2007-08-17T05:54:00.000Z	vanberge	morodock_	i think i am close!!
2007-08-17T05:55:00.000Z	morodock_	vanberge	ok, let me know if you get stuck
2007-08-17T05:55:00.000Z	vanberge	morodock_	i think i just need to open up so client can access server
2007-08-17T05:55:00.000Z	vanberge	morodock_	right now i can't even ping the server
2007-08-17T06:19:00.000Z	morodock_	vanberge	sorry, was afk, but yeah, if you can't ping the other system... it won't work, need open communication between the 2 servers
2007-08-17T06:19:00.000Z	morodock_	vanberge	I'm assuming they are both on the same lan correct?
2007-08-17T06:19:00.000Z	vanberge	morodock_	np... i was afk myself.
2007-08-17T06:19:00.000Z	vanberge	morodock_	yes... and i have successful connection now... just trying to figure out how to use it
2007-08-17T06:21:00.000Z	vanberge	morodock_	is it a problem if i'm using compiz fusion on one machine?
2007-08-17T06:22:00.000Z	morodock_	vanberge	not sure, I've never done that before, but I don't think it should affect it
2007-08-17T06:22:00.000Z	vanberge	morodock_	well, i'm able to connect but dont seem to be able to move mouse around or anything
2007-08-17T06:24:00.000Z	morodock_	vanberge	what are the 2 operating systems? one windows and 1 ubuntu?
2007-08-17T06:24:00.000Z	vanberge	morodock_	 both ubuntu 7.04
2007-08-17T06:26:00.000Z	morodock_	vanberge	not sure what to tell you. Usually the trick is to get them connected, once they are connected it's very straight forward. If it's not working then maybe there is something else complicating it like compiz. but I've used it on numerous OS'es before without incident.
2007-08-17T06:30:00.000Z	vanberge	morodock_	i guess i'm a little confused... how do i grab control?  :-/
2007-08-17T06:44:00.000Z	vanberge	morodock_	i got it working
2007-08-17T06:44:00.000Z	vanberge	morodock_	i had a messed up config...  :-(
