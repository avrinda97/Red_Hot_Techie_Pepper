2006-03-30T17:20:00.000Z	gfxstyler	sYndax	you tried removing your firefox config?
2006-03-30T17:21:00.000Z	gfxstyler	sYndax	is it just firefox?
2006-03-30T17:21:00.000Z	sYndax	gfxstyler	i followed the wiki guide on how to install the ff 1.5
2006-03-30T17:21:00.000Z	gfxstyler	sYndax	maybe you have wrong settings or wrong plugins
2006-03-30T17:22:00.000Z	gfxstyler	sYndax	thats why you should try removing your configuration
2006-03-30T17:22:00.000Z	sYndax	gfxstyler	?
2006-03-30T17:22:00.000Z	gfxstyler	sYndax	in your user directory, remove .mozilla or .firefox
2006-03-30T17:23:00.000Z	sYndax	gfxstyler	this wont affect my ff 1.5?
2006-03-30T17:23:00.000Z	gfxstyler	sYndax	you will have to setup the configuration again if you dont like the defaults .. like the default homepage and such stuff
2006-03-30T17:27:00.000Z	sYndax	gfxstyler	i see no .mozilla or .firefox
2006-03-30T17:28:00.000Z	gfxstyler	sYndax	not possible, there has to be some configuration in /home/username/.mozilla
2006-03-30T17:30:00.000Z	sYndax	gfxstyler	wuts the del cmd? (linux newbie here)...
2006-03-30T17:31:00.000Z	gfxstyler	sYndax	open up a terminal and type "rm -r .mozilla/firefox"
2006-03-30T17:31:00.000Z	sYndax	gfxstyler	to dell the dir entirly?
2006-03-30T17:31:00.000Z	gfxstyler	sYndax	yes, just the firefox directory
2006-03-30T17:32:00.000Z	sYndax	gfxstyler	but i have some plugins and such...
2006-03-30T17:32:00.000Z	gfxstyler	sYndax	if you installed them system-wide, you will still have them
2006-03-30T17:32:00.000Z	sYndax	gfxstyler	it says something on a defautl dir... which is write protected...
2006-03-30T17:33:00.000Z	gfxstyler	sYndax	if not, you will have to backup them first or download them again - but maybe thats the problem, for example some defect plugin which uses 50% cpu
