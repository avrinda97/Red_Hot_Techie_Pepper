2011-01-21T00:14:00.000Z	gobbe	ivan_	build quality is not so good as in intels, they are faster and can break easier
2011-01-21T00:14:00.000Z	gobbe	ivan_	so i would say do your backups
2011-01-21T00:15:00.000Z	gobbe	ivan_	in our company we have had ~5 cases in past 2 years where ocz's has broke
2011-01-21T00:15:00.000Z	ivan_	gobbe	hdparm? with other stuff open, but don't think that something was accessing a lot the disk
2011-01-21T00:15:00.000Z	gobbe	ivan_	what parameters did you use?
2011-01-21T00:16:00.000Z	ivan_	gobbe	nice :( about backups sure... i'm putting everything on dropbox and github for the source.... i'd lose stuff like movies&audio, but it's not a big issue :)
2011-01-21T00:16:00.000Z	ivan_	gobbe	hdparm -tT /dev/sda
2011-01-21T00:16:00.000Z	gobbe	ivan_	aah, ok, i can get something like 180
2011-01-21T00:17:00.000Z	ivan_	gobbe	cool :)
2011-01-21T00:17:00.000Z	gobbe	ivan_	actually 206 says now
2011-01-21T00:17:00.000Z	gobbe	ivan_	and this is intel
2011-01-21T00:18:00.000Z	ivan_	gobbe	my big problem is when i have netbeans/kontact/nepomuk which index the whole world and the computer just start go so slow... :) hope to resolv in part with the ocz
2011-01-21T00:18:00.000Z	gobbe	ivan_	are you running encryption or something?
2011-01-21T00:18:00.000Z	ivan_	gobbe	yes, on home dir
2011-01-21T00:19:00.000Z	gobbe	ivan_	ok, that can slow down ofcourse
2011-01-21T00:19:00.000Z	ivan_	gobbe	yeah, i know, but i prefer to have it, you never know :)
2011-01-21T00:19:00.000Z	gobbe	ivan_	i know, i run luks but it means that i cannot use trim
2011-01-21T00:20:00.000Z	ivan_	gobbe	mm..i think that it's a bad thing... do you know what is used by default to encrypt the home dir?
2011-01-21T00:21:00.000Z	gobbe	ivan_	what is bad thing? bot using trim?
2011-01-21T00:22:00.000Z	ivan_	gobbe	not be able to use trim.. i mean, i'm actually new on ssd's but i've read that it's useful ;)
2011-01-21T00:22:00.000Z	gobbe	ivan_	well...it can slow down the ssd in future, but i'v been running this for ~2 years now
