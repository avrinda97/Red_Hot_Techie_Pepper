2012-05-02T11:03:00.000Z	ubuntu_	alankila	this hard drive is probably ehh 3-4 yrs old since the computer is 3-4 yrs old
2012-05-02T11:03:00.000Z	ubuntu_		it may not be that smart
2012-05-02T11:03:00.000Z	alankila	ubuntu_	sorry, this tech is over decade old by this point
2012-05-02T11:03:00.000Z	ubuntu_		oh neat
2012-05-02T11:03:00.000Z	alankila		it's called smart and it landed in a splash, I think, before 2000
2012-05-02T11:04:00.000Z	ubuntu_		I dunno. I tried reinstalling ubuntu just a couple hours ago, if it could remap sectors, installation should have succeeded
2012-05-02T11:04:00.000Z	ubuntu_		But I was greeted with  a"We're sorry. The installer has crashed" message
2012-05-02T11:04:00.000Z	alankila	ubuntu_	you should probably install smartmontools and start smartd. You can configure it to check your disks using the harddisk's built-in diagnostics every sunday or something such
2012-05-02T11:04:00.000Z	ubuntu_		ah cool
2012-05-02T11:05:00.000Z	alankila		this is a kind of scrub where the drive goes through the platter surface and scans it for defects and it usually gets early warning about nonreadable sectors and remaps them before bad things actually happen to that data
2012-05-02T11:05:00.000Z	ubuntu_		heh "FATAL ERROR: cannot open disk drive!"
2012-05-02T11:06:00.000Z	ubuntu_		think I'll just chuck the drive in the garbage :P
2012-05-02T11:06:00.000Z	ubuntu_		was it remount?
2012-05-02T11:06:00.000Z	ubuntu_		because I keep wanting to write to my usb drive but it's mounted read-only right now
2012-05-02T11:07:00.000Z	ubuntu_		oh yea I know, I was asking s0u][ight
2012-05-02T11:07:00.000Z	ubuntu_		if that's what his solution was
2012-05-02T11:08:00.000Z	ubuntu_		What determines default permissions when a file or folder is created
2012-05-02T11:09:00.000Z	ubuntu_		I test-touched a file, and it was automatically set +x
2012-05-02T11:10:00.000Z	ubuntu_		Whereas normally when I make files, that bit isn't automatically set
2012-05-02T11:10:00.000Z	alankila	ubuntu_	by the way, read-only mounting is what some filesystems do when they detect internal inconsistencies. You do filesystem check on them. If the harddisk surface is somehow damaged, you tend to get actual i/o errors
