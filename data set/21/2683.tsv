2009-09-04T16:38:00.000Z	grawity	aaron11	'Super' is the key with Windows logo on it (or Tux logo, if you're that much of a geek)
2009-09-04T16:39:00.000Z	grawity	aaron11	no, it isn't. The Home and Windows keys are totally separate
2009-09-04T16:39:00.000Z	grawity	aaron11	And ubottu is a bot.
2009-09-06T19:57:00.000Z	grawity	aaron11	I agree about newbies.
2009-09-06T19:58:00.000Z	aaron11	grawity	are u talking about me
2009-09-29T21:56:00.000Z	grawity	aaron11	Windows doesn't come with a SSH server, so you'll need to install one - Bitvise WinSSHd is nice. But seriously, for connecting to Windows, RDP (Remote Desktop) is much more useful.
2009-09-29T22:03:00.000Z	grawity	aaron11	Run ssh -v 155.x.x.x, see where it hangs.
2009-09-29T22:05:00.000Z	grawity	aaron11	Try adding an exception to Windows' firewall.
2009-10-03T15:17:00.000Z	grawity	aaron11	The site uses an expired SSL certificate (expired yesterday, so not that bad).
2009-11-18T22:28:00.000Z	grawity	aaron11	You only got the factoid database - see "Launchpad project page" for ubottu itself.
2009-11-19T20:17:00.000Z	grawity	aaron11	Tried unpacking it?
2009-11-19T20:21:00.000Z	aaron11	grawity	I extracted from Downloads to Desktop
