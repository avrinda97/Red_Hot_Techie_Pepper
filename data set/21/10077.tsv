2005-05-18T08:59:00.000Z	jamesio		just had an interesting thing show up.  I partitioned an external usb2 300 gig drive using gparted, but sfdisk says that the partition is the wrong size and should be recreated
2005-05-18T09:00:00.000Z	goofrider	jamesio	I don't know what I can tell u. Parted, sfdisk, and fdisk like to disagree a lot
2005-05-18T09:01:00.000Z	jamesio	goofrider	that's funny.  so, which is the "most stable" of programs?
2005-05-18T09:02:00.000Z	jamesio	goofrider	you don't happen to know how to tell sfdisk to use "all of the disk", do you?  the --help doesn't show anything like it
2005-05-18T09:03:00.000Z	jamesio	goofrider	I have too many disks to sit down and figure out their sizes...
2005-05-18T09:03:00.000Z	goofrider	jamesio	I don't think sfdisk has such feature. It seems to REQUIRES start/end params
2005-05-18T09:03:00.000Z	jamesio	goofrider	that's even funnier... I have no idea what the specs are supposed to be for all of the drives.  I've blown away my windows server and am starting fresh in ubuntu
2005-05-18T09:04:00.000Z	goofrider	jamesio	I know it kinda sucks. But I think your best shot is first figure out if the sfidk warning is anything to worry about and if parted did the right job
2005-05-18T09:04:00.000Z	jamesio	goofrider	put yourself in my shoes... I have 14 hard drives (7 internal, 7 external usb2) ranging in size from 80 gig to 300 gig
2005-05-18T09:05:00.000Z	jamesio	goofrider	and I want to partition each as a separate drive...  (just how I do things for safety sakes)
2005-05-18T09:07:00.000Z	jamesio	goofrider	I think I'm going with gparted... even though I bitched that it's slow, it does at least allow me "ease of use"
2005-05-18T09:08:00.000Z	jamesio	goofrider	and it seems to work... just wish there were an easy way to auto add any new partitions to /etc/fstab
2005-05-18T09:12:00.000Z	goofrider	jamesio	sorry if I can't be more helpful. Partitiong is something I've been struggling with
2005-05-18T09:12:00.000Z	jamesio	goofrider	nah... you have been helpful.  you've shown to me that it's "not just me"
2005-05-18T09:15:00.000Z	jamesio	goofrider	know of an easy way to add partitions to /etc/fstab (short of editing it myself?)
2005-05-18T09:17:00.000Z	jamesio	goofrider	what I think I'm going to do is physically label all the exernal drives one-by-one and partition/name them in ubuntu with the label name
2005-05-18T09:17:00.000Z	jamesio	goofrider	that way I can easily know which drive I need to take off in case of failure
2005-05-18T09:20:00.000Z	jamesio	goofrider	everyone keeps telling me that...  in windows I set the drives up individually and used robocopy to duplicate data to like-sized drives.  it worked for me... never lost anything (even after 2 bad "re-install the os" crashes)
2005-05-21T09:06:00.000Z	goofrider	jamesio	i use LVM, not raid though
2005-05-21T09:09:00.000Z	goofrider	jamesio	oh that kind of mirroring
2005-05-21T09:09:00.000Z	goofrider	jamesio	i don't know how u can possibly achieve that with losing half your hair because IP address, net conf, hardware conf, hostnames, etc., all gets copied
