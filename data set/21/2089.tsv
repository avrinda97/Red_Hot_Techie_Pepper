2010-01-25T18:34:00.000Z	s00p		I'm in a bit of trouble here guys... ubuntu karmic amd64 and it'll only let me switch tasks once. After that, I need to ALT+F4 to close the application (it won't let me click the close button) or I can't use anything except the application that has focus
2010-01-25T18:35:00.000Z	s00p		let me check
2010-01-25T18:35:00.000Z	s00p		a bunch of things from psmouse.c retry

2010-01-25T18:38:00.000Z	AndreMorro[BR]	s00p	well you came here looking for help, I'm doing a few research to imagine the scenario you're working on, if you don't need help why are you here?
2010-01-25T18:48:00.000Z	AndreMorro[BR]	s00p	try to deactive desktop effect
2010-01-25T18:49:00.000Z	AndreMorro[BR]	s00p	press alt f2 the run gksu gnome-display-properties
2010-01-25T18:50:00.000Z	AndreMorro[BR]	s00p	it can be a bug in you video-driver , and the "desktop effects" are causing a bug in your window manager
2010-01-25T18:51:00.000Z	AndreMorro[BR]	s00p	yeah, its a test thou...
2010-01-25T18:52:00.000Z	AndreMorro[BR]	s00p	still not working?

2010-01-25T18:54:00.000Z	AndreMorro[BR]	s00p	check the video-drivers
2010-01-25T18:54:00.000Z	AndreMorro[BR]	s00p	updates, bugs...
2010-01-25T18:55:00.000Z	s00p	AndreMorro[BR]	heh, I run sudo apt-get update & upgrade every day if that's what you mean
2010-01-25T18:56:00.000Z	AndreMorro[BR]	s00p	uh... yeah, tahts helps to but, sometimes a update may crash your system just by adding something to where it shoudnt,
