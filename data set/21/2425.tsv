2009-12-17T08:23:00.000Z	haven489	otokoyama	could you help me with my partitioning problem?
2009-12-17T08:23:00.000Z	otokoyama	haven489	the swap files may be locked so you might need to umount them
2009-12-17T08:24:00.000Z	haven489	otokoyama	tired, i need to get a swap and one 20gb partition
2009-12-17T08:24:00.000Z	haven489	otokoyama	they are not mounted
2009-12-17T08:25:00.000Z	otokoyama	haven489	hm, what exactly is the error your getting
2009-12-17T08:25:00.000Z	haven489	otokoyama	when i pressed delete and i had a 20gb partition, it said i needed a swap, i don't know how to make swap,
2009-12-17T08:26:00.000Z	haven489	otokoyama	could you lead me through the process? i am new at the partitioning with linux,
2009-12-17T08:26:00.000Z	otokoyama	haven489	you should be able to allocate some freespace to creating a swap partition: right click then click create > volume format= swap
2009-12-17T08:26:00.000Z	haven489	otokoyama	ok i will try brb
2009-12-17T08:26:00.000Z	otokoyama	haven489	wait read this http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/installing
2009-12-17T08:31:00.000Z	haven489	otokoyama	i need to make the partition, I made it ext4 because i have XP (trying with grub and dual boot) now do i do "/" or "/boot" or what?
2009-12-17T08:32:00.000Z	otokoyama	haven489	you dont need to use /boot really these days unless ur running a weird experimental FS, so i recommend just swap and /
2009-12-17T08:33:00.000Z	haven489	otokoyama	ok
2009-12-17T08:34:00.000Z	otokoyama	haven489	ext4 is stable enuff to hold a boot area
2009-12-17T08:36:00.000Z	haven489	otokoyama	ok, so my ext4 is 20GB, my swap is 945Mb (that was default) is that going to work?
2009-12-17T08:37:00.000Z	otokoyama	haven489	it depends on how much ram you have i guess and what tasks you will be performing, gparted will just make a educated guess based on your current ram,
2009-12-17T08:37:00.000Z	haven489	otokoyama	ok thats fine ty for the help =)
2009-12-17T08:37:00.000Z	otokoyama	haven489	np hope it works
