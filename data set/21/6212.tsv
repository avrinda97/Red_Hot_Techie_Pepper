2008-06-07T10:30:00.000Z	Jalathan		:P
2008-06-07T10:32:00.000Z	Jalathan		for at least the 6000 to early 7000 series
2008-06-07T10:34:00.000Z	nickrud	Jalathan	that's normal with compiz, it doesn't play well with other gl stuff yet I hear
2008-06-07T10:50:00.000Z	Jalathan	nickrud	hrm i just tested compiz & blender combined with no issue on an nVidia 7050 (was away getting my nvidia machine running)
2008-06-07T10:50:00.000Z	nickrud	Jalathan	my info may be a little old
2008-06-07T10:52:00.000Z	nickrud	Jalathan	#compiz-fusion usually has pretty knowledgeable people around
2008-06-07T10:53:00.000Z	Jalathan	nickrud	np, was just verifying my memory
2008-06-08T22:33:00.000Z	nickrud	Jalathan	is this a new kernel you compiled?
2008-06-08T22:34:00.000Z	Jalathan	nickrud	yes
2008-06-08T22:34:00.000Z	nickrud	Jalathan	take a look at one of the stanza's at the end of /boot/grub/menu.lst , you would create a new one similar to those
2008-06-08T22:36:00.000Z	Jalathan	nickrud	hrm, i put that on there for this kernel, however i noted that the initrd.img is missing for this kernel (sorry for not being completely clear)
2008-06-08T22:37:00.000Z	nickrud	Jalathan	that is necessary (or not) depending what you compiled into the kernel
2008-06-08T22:37:00.000Z	Jalathan	nickrud	kk, ty
2008-06-08T22:38:00.000Z	nickrud	Jalathan	you want to make sure you have your disk hardware driver and ext2 file support compiled into the kernel, to avoid having to use an initrd.img
2008-06-08T22:41:00.000Z	Jalathan	nickrud	ah, ok, makes sense, i wasn't completely sure as to what they were for...
2008-06-13T11:22:00.000Z	Jalathan	nickrud	?
2008-06-13T11:22:00.000Z	nickrud	Jalathan	? back at you :)
2008-06-13T11:36:00.000Z	nickrud	Jalathan	I'm using the generic flash here ;)
2008-06-13T11:37:00.000Z	Jalathan	nickrud	the generic adobe flash player? or an OSS flash player?
2008-06-13T11:37:00.000Z	nickrud	Jalathan	adobe is one of the last non-free things on my machine
2008-06-13T11:38:00.000Z	Jalathan	nickrud	i pointed that out because the mplayer plugin showed up with the /house/video popup
