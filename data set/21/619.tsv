2012-01-22T16:30:00.000Z	ryannathans		can someone have a look and confirm my bug?
2012-01-22T16:30:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ryannathans	sure
2012-01-22T16:30:00.000Z	ryannathans	Chipzzz	thanks
2012-01-22T16:31:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ryannathans	waiting to hear about the bug...
2012-01-22T16:31:00.000Z	ryannathans	Chipzzz	does that spam in dmesg look normal?

2012-01-22T16:38:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ryannathans	off the top of my head, i'd guess the wireless card isn't reinitializing correctly and consequently never reconnects
2012-01-22T16:38:00.000Z	ryannathans	Chipzzz	happens with both my ath9k inturnal wifi and usb rt2800usb alfa networks
2012-01-22T16:40:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ryannathans	I remember having had problems with an rt2400 series pci card that had to be started from a cold boot in order to initialize properly, but that was a long time ago
2012-01-22T16:41:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ryannathans	the situation does seem vaguely analogous, though
2012-01-22T16:43:00.000Z	ryannathans	Chipzzz	what do you suggest?
2012-01-22T16:44:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ryannathans	is it necessary to change mac addresses often, or can you just find one and leave it alone for a few days?
2012-01-22T16:45:00.000Z	ryannathans	Chipzzz	there is one network i need to access and it has mac filtering
2012-01-22T16:49:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ryannathans	dunno... i think some software has mac spoofing built in but this isn't the channel to discuss that kind of software ;)
2012-01-22T16:49:00.000Z	ryannathans	Chipzzz	software like macchanger?
2012-01-22T16:54:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ryannathans	i was thinking more like metasploit or something in that category... i haven't looked into it deeply but i think it can be done independently of the wireless card
2012-01-22T16:55:00.000Z	ryannathans	Chipzzz	I'm aware of that kind of stuff, I can hack any residentual security wifi network
2012-01-22T16:55:00.000Z	ryannathans	Chipzzz	and i'm still stuck ;d
2012-01-22T16:55:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ryannathans	*shrugs* then you're more knowledgable on the subject than i :)
2012-01-22T16:55:00.000Z	ryannathans	Chipzzz	hehe ;D
