2009-12-26T06:48:00.000Z	airtonix	og01	you and dragondaddy  might want to investigate ntfs3g
2009-12-26T06:50:00.000Z	airtonix	og01	natuilus then handles the automounting of the windows drive
2009-12-26T06:50:00.000Z	og01	airtonix	you can drive this guy with that if you like
2009-12-26T06:50:00.000Z	og01	airtonix	i get stuck in my ways sometimes
2009-12-26T06:51:00.000Z	og01	airtonix	though i think he should have the drive mounted already at /mnt/windows
2009-12-26T06:51:00.000Z	airtonix	og01	dragondaddy the first thing to work out if automounting will work is if you see extra drives in nautilus at computer://
2009-12-26T06:52:00.000Z	airtonix	og01	dragondaddy if you try double clicking on the drive that you suspect is your windows drive, from memory i think it then sees that it can't read the partition type and ses that it is a ntfs partition and offers to download the ntfs drivers.
2009-12-26T06:53:00.000Z	og01	airtonix	will the automount happen within the console
2009-12-26T06:53:00.000Z	og01	airtonix	or is it nautulis only?
2009-12-26T06:53:00.000Z	airtonix	og01	no its all intiated by nautilus i think.
2009-12-26T06:54:00.000Z	airtonix	og01	dragondaddy syntax for ntfs-3g is :  ntfs-3g /dev/sda1 /mnt/windows
2009-12-26T06:54:00.000Z	og01	airtonix	ehh no good to me really, spend too much time in console
2009-12-26T06:55:00.000Z	airtonix	og01	nautilus simply takes the uuid of the partition and creates a temp folder of that name under ~/.gvfs/drive-uuid
2009-12-26T06:56:00.000Z	og01	airtonix	ok
2009-12-26T06:56:00.000Z	og01	airtonix	and it presents this mounted folder as computer://suchandsuch
2009-12-26T06:56:00.000Z	og01	airtonix	when does it perform the mount?
2009-12-26T06:57:00.000Z	airtonix	og01	if you take the nautilus approach, the drive appears on the desktop and it appears under computer://
2009-12-26T06:57:00.000Z	airtonix	og01	(i assume the same would be true of the cli approach)
2009-12-26T06:58:00.000Z	og01	airtonix	perhaps under the ~/Desktop maybe... but computer:// means nothing in the console
2009-12-26T06:58:00.000Z	airtonix	og01	true.. the item you see on the desktop is something nautilus does (like it does with cdroms)
2009-12-26T07:03:00.000Z	og01	airtonix	thanks for the explination, i know about the funkery that was annoying me when i first installed ubuntu
