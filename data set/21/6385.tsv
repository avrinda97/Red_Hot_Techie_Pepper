2007-04-15T05:32:00.000Z	ajehuk	wj32	: I have a question... :)
2007-04-15T05:33:00.000Z	wj32	ajehuk	go on...
2007-04-15T06:29:00.000Z	ajehuk	wj32	- tbuss wouldnt do that, he wouldnt delete stuff that is managed by apt - would you tbuss -
2007-04-15T06:49:00.000Z	wj32	ajehuk	mines a total of 60mb
2007-04-15T06:50:00.000Z	ajehuk	wj32	- MrMakeveli (see wj32's comment) yeah - its peanuts, no need to allocate 1.5Gb
2007-04-15T06:50:00.000Z	wj32	ajehuk	my kernels 1.5M, initrd is 7mb
2007-04-15T06:51:00.000Z	ajehuk	wj32	- Im running etch with a custom kernel, and have the canilla kernel sat as a spare, and I am still only using 30 odd percent of the available space....
2007-04-15T07:15:00.000Z	wj32	ajehuk	im using radeon 9550 as well
2007-04-15T07:15:00.000Z	ajehuk	wj32	- any luck with beryl / compiz?
2007-04-15T07:15:00.000Z	wj32	ajehuk	a long time ago i had dri with the radeon drivers but i cant get it now
2007-04-15T07:16:00.000Z	wj32	ajehuk	i currently use fglrx with xgl
2007-04-15T07:16:00.000Z	ajehuk	wj32	- Im tri monitor so I dont bother anymore ( the second card is a Matrox with 4Mb videoram)
2007-04-15T07:17:00.000Z	wj32	ajehuk	cool
2007-04-15T07:18:00.000Z	ajehuk	wj32	- I actually though dri was possible but that you lost something else (compositing?) when it was enabled so the driver is OK but not there yet.. I may be wrong...
2007-04-15T07:19:00.000Z	wj32	ajehuk	with the radeon drivers dri with composite is possible. with fglrx its not. so, if you want composite with fglrx, its gonna be SLLLOOOWWWWW
2007-04-15T07:19:00.000Z	wj32	ajehuk	sadly, radeon dri doesnt work for me. it DID a long time ago.
2007-04-15T07:19:00.000Z	ajehuk	wj32	- knew it was somethin glike that... ah well who needs 3d anyway,
2007-04-15T07:19:00.000Z	wj32	ajehuk	or maybe that was when i was using geforce4
2007-04-15T07:20:00.000Z	wj32	ajehuk	ati sucks.
