2009-05-15T17:03:00.000Z	silentx		Hey .. I have installed the ubuntu 9.04 new fresh and i used to use 8.10 but my hard drive still EXT3 could help me to change it to EXT4
2009-05-15T17:04:00.000Z	kholerabbi	silentx	you will have to do that through the 9.04 liveCD
2009-05-15T17:05:00.000Z	silentx	kholerabbi	could you tell me how or just give me a tutorial about it ? and what is the different i will get ?
2009-05-15T17:05:00.000Z	kholerabbi	silentx	sure see: http://ext4.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Ext4_Howto#Converting_an_ext3_filesystem_to_ext4
2009-05-15T17:05:00.000Z	silentx		THNKS :)
2009-05-15T17:05:00.000Z	kholerabbi	silentx	I do not think you will notice a difference.
2009-05-15T17:08:00.000Z	kholerabbi	silentx	make sure you do not run those commands on a mounted partition- OK? that could be dangerous for your data.
2009-05-15T17:08:00.000Z	silentx		:S
2009-05-15T17:08:00.000Z	silentx		oky i was just going to do it !
2009-05-15T17:08:00.000Z	silentx		brb i will restart c ya
2009-05-15T17:08:00.000Z	kholerabbi	silentx	liveCD :P
2009-05-15T17:08:00.000Z	silentx		yep ;)
2009-05-15T17:11:00.000Z	silentx	kholerabbi	i think what is need just to run liveCD write the command "tune2fs -O extents,uninit_bg,dir_index /dev/DEV" then the command "e2fsck -fD /dev/DEV" Right ?
2009-05-15T17:12:00.000Z	kholerabbi		silentx- yep except replace DEV with your filesystemm (e.g, mine was dsb3)
2009-05-15T17:13:00.000Z	kholerabbi		silentX: *sdb3 - check out system > administration > disk partitioner for more info on your partitions
