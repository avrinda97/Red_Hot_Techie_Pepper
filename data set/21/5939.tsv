2007-07-06T08:16:00.000Z	andylockran		but rember how to get back in
2007-07-06T08:16:00.000Z	Montaro	andylockran	i was about to correct you again :P
2007-07-06T08:16:00.000Z	andylockran	Montaro	thanks :p 0 didn't see that
2007-07-06T08:18:00.000Z	andylockran	Montaro	what's your opinion on SirTane's situation?
2007-07-06T08:20:00.000Z	Montaro	andylockran	I think he needs to figure out the ctrl+a then d thing.. its a bit hard to explain in text.. lets try.. basically do this.. press ctrl+a (like ctrl and a at the same time) then let it off and hit d.. that should detatch you.. make any sense?
2007-07-06T08:20:00.000Z	andylockran	Montaro	sorry - that's all working fine
2007-07-06T08:20:00.000Z	andylockran	Montaro	he can't get a graphical environment after a fresh netinstall of ubuntu
2007-07-06T08:21:00.000Z	andylockran	Montaro	so just got him to get screen an irssi working so I could help him
2007-07-06T08:22:00.000Z	Montaro	andylockran	ok cool, the errors its giving should aid us in a more successful diagnosis of the problem :)
2007-07-06T08:22:00.000Z	andylockran	Montaro	I've also got him to run aptitude install ubuntu-desktop - to make sure he's got all the packages installed
2007-07-06T08:23:00.000Z	Montaro	andylockran	good thinking, has he already done installed the ubuntu-desktop metapackage, or is he doing that now?
2007-07-06T08:24:00.000Z	andylockran	Montaro	I don't know - ut given he's not back here yet means that the aptitude install ubuntu-desktop probably had to do something
2007-07-06T08:25:00.000Z	Montaro	andylockran	ah i see. which might be a good thing, that might even solve his problem alone. Lets hope he either has the CD setup as his apt mirror, or he had a decent connection, because a full ubuntu-desktop install is quite large if you need to download it all on a slow line :P
2007-07-06T08:25:00.000Z	andylockran	Montaro	pike__:  I'm gonna have to head out in 5 - and chance one of you can talk it throgh with SirTane?
2007-07-06T08:26:00.000Z	Montaro	andylockran	sure thing I'll help him as best i can.
2007-07-06T08:26:00.000Z	andylockran	Montaro	kudos
2007-07-06T08:26:00.000Z	Montaro	andylockran	np, ciao :)
2007-07-06T08:28:00.000Z	andylockran	Montaro	see you later - off now
