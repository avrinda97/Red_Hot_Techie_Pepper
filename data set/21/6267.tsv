2007-05-05T08:53:00.000Z	unimatrix9	Vastlee	: welcome
2007-05-05T08:53:00.000Z	Vastlee	unimatrix9	 Thanks, it's been fairly pleasant, if I could just get my other drive to show up.
2007-05-05T08:55:00.000Z	unimatrix9	Vastlee	: what drive would you like to get acces to?
2007-05-05T08:57:00.000Z	Vastlee	unimatrix9	I have a drive sdb1 with about 200 gigs of data on it that is ntfs partitioned.  I'm trying to get it mounted with permission to read/write.  When I converted from windows this was a seperate drive and I could see the files but not delete/edit them.  I came in here seeking help and someone helped me unmount it and remount it, but now I can't see any of the files.
2007-05-05T08:58:00.000Z	unimatrix9	Vastlee	; i dont know if its wise to write to the drive with ubuntu , can some one tell us if ntfs is fully supported yet?
2007-05-05T08:59:00.000Z	Vastlee	unimatrix9	I would be willing to convert the data over to ext3 if that is possible.  As long as I could mount the drive with SAMBA and read it from my other windows machine.
2007-05-05T09:01:00.000Z	unimatrix9	Vastlee	: the wiser idea would maybe be to format an part of the drive as fat32 ( unless the files are bigger then 4Gig...)
2007-05-05T09:02:00.000Z	Vastlee	unimatrix9	An idea I might consider if I didn't already have 200 gigs of info that I really didn't want to lose.
2007-05-05T09:02:00.000Z	unimatrix9	Vastlee	: and use that part as the space for exchanging files
2007-05-05T09:02:00.000Z	unimatrix9	Vastlee	: i get your point..
2007-05-05T09:02:00.000Z	Vastlee	unimatrix9	 Actually...
2007-05-05T09:03:00.000Z	Vastlee	unimatrix9	 I might be able to get rid of some old stuff and have room on my sba1 drive to copy everything over.
2007-05-05T09:03:00.000Z	unimatrix9	Vastlee	: the reading is not the problem , from linux you can read the drive
2007-05-05T09:04:00.000Z	unimatrix9	Vastlee	: the writing though is not wise using ubuntu...to ntfs disk
2007-05-05T09:04:00.000Z	Vastlee	unimatrix9	 The whole problem from the get go has been the permissions.  I could read them fine but not delete/change them.
2007-05-05T09:04:00.000Z	Vastlee	unimatrix9	 I do see your point and in the long run it might be beneficial to go ahead and change over to ext3.
2007-05-05T09:05:00.000Z	Vastlee	unimatrix9	Is there a tool/utility that would convert the data/drive over to ext3 without formating it?
2007-05-05T09:07:00.000Z	unimatrix9	Vastlee	: no tool , not that i know off, keep it ntfs, and work out an solution ...in an other way
2007-05-05T09:07:00.000Z	Vastlee	unimatrix9	 Been trying to do so for about 3 hours now.  :(  It's actually getting worse.  When I first setup Ubuntu it set that drive up as media/disk and I could see all the files.  Since being in here I've unmounted it and remounted it, now I can't see the data at all.
2007-05-05T09:09:00.000Z	unimatrix9	Vastlee	: maybe you need to take an rest before you proceed...any way here an read for you https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/ch10s03.html
2007-05-05T09:14:00.000Z	unimatrix9	Vastlee	: there are lots of tips about ubuntu here..https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/index.html
