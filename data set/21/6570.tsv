2008-05-11T17:37:00.000Z	m1r	RainCT	what if u moving /etc to same machine ? then it should be ok ?
2008-05-11T17:37:00.000Z	RainCT	m1r	yes but if you have a different Ubuntu version there I still don't recommend it
2008-05-11T17:38:00.000Z	m1r	RainCT	, 2 same machines, both ubuntu 8.04
2008-05-11T17:38:00.000Z	RainCT	m1r	well, basically the first question you should ask you is: have I touched any file in /etc?
2008-05-11T17:39:00.000Z	RainCT	m1r	if the answer is not, then you don't need them. if the answer is yes, try to remember what files it where and copy them, or duplicate the changes you did
2008-05-11T17:41:00.000Z	m1r	RainCT	ok , think i got the idea:) tnx
2008-05-11T17:42:00.000Z	RainCT	m1r	the really important stuff are the hidden files from your home directory, which contain the configuration and data (when applicable) of all your applications
2008-05-11T17:42:00.000Z	RainCT	m1r	yw
2008-05-11T17:43:00.000Z	m1r	RainCT	what about replicating all software from one machien to other? that is all hidden in /etc, right ?
2008-05-11T17:44:00.000Z	RainCT	m1r	installing the same applications you mean? no, they are all around the filesystem (binaries in /bin, /sbin/, /usr/bin or /usr/games, data in /usr/share/, global configuration in /etc, etc.)
2008-05-11T17:44:00.000Z	RainCT	m1r	you can get a list of all installed packages and install them on the new PC if you wnat, though
2008-05-11T17:44:00.000Z	RainCT	m1r	(if you're interested I can tell you what the command for that would be)
2008-05-11T17:45:00.000Z	RainCT	m1r	also, if you don't want to download the packages again many of them should still be /var/cache/apt/archive; you can copy the files from there over to the other machine
2008-05-11T17:46:00.000Z	RainCT	m1r	one moment..
2008-05-11T17:46:00.000Z	m1r	RainCT	so copy files from main machine /var/cache/apt/archive to 2nd machine , then install programs u mean ?*
2008-05-11T17:47:00.000Z	RainCT	m1r	yes. I'm trying to think of a command to get a list of all installed programs, will tell you in a moment
2008-05-11T17:47:00.000Z	m1r	RainCT	ok tnx
2008-05-11T17:49:00.000Z	RainCT	m1r	dpkg -l | cut -d' ' -f3 | grep -v '=' | grep -v '(' | xargs echo > filelist
2008-05-11T17:49:00.000Z	RainCT	m1r	ok, Pelo's is better
2008-05-11T18:46:00.000Z	RainCT	m1r	unbusy it :P:P
