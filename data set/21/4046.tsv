2009-05-16T18:15:00.000Z	dominoeffekt		Oh okey
2009-05-16T18:16:00.000Z	dominoeffekt		Well. I have to Unzinp a file in to a directory. The zip file is not in the same directory. How do i do then??
2009-05-16T18:17:00.000Z	jtaji	dominoeffekt	looking at 'man unzip', I find that you can use unzip FILE -d EXDIR, where EXDIR is the directory you want to extract to
2009-05-16T18:12:00.000Z	jtaji	dominoeffekt	unzip FILE
2009-05-16T18:14:00.000Z	dominoeffekt	jtaji	 okey :D  can i privv u? i have one more question. Its hard to explain. Its about the zip file
2009-05-16T18:15:00.000Z	jtaji	dominoeffekt	sorry I have them disabled, ask here there are plenty who can help
2009-05-16T18:19:00.000Z	jtaji	dominoeffekt	first you wouldn't have to be where the zip file is if you gave the full path to it, secondly you'll need sudo to unzip into /usr/local, and this is UNLIKELY to be what you want to do
2009-05-16T18:19:00.000Z	jtaji	dominoeffekt	what is it exactly?
2009-05-16T18:20:00.000Z	dominoeffekt	jtaji	 its java. For firefox
2009-05-16T18:22:00.000Z	jtaji	dominoeffekt	ok, typically you would want to just use what is in the repositories... I'm not that up on Java, maybe someone else here can help you with why you need to install it manually
2009-05-16T18:23:00.000Z	dominoeffekt	jtaji	 im just folowing a guide for it atm. But just in the ending it just sed Unzip ---> here. And i didnt know how to unzip :d
2009-05-16T18:23:00.000Z	jtaji	dominoeffekt	no problem
2009-05-16T18:25:00.000Z	dominoeffekt	jtaji	 im doint it in a windowd mode with the "unzipper" But i do not have promission to change anything in the map.  How do i login as root in "window" mode?
2009-05-16T18:26:00.000Z	jtaji	dominoeffekt	that's a whole 'nother story... I thought you wanted to do it on the command line? that's the best way honestly
2009-05-16T18:26:00.000Z	jtaji	dominoeffekt	otherwise you need to launch the GUI apps with gksudo, but be very very careful when having GUI apps running as root
2009-05-16T18:31:00.000Z	jtaji	dominoeffekt	gksudo file--roller
2009-05-16T18:32:00.000Z	jtaji	dominoeffekt	gksudo file-roller
2009-05-16T18:32:00.000Z	dominoeffekt	jtaji	the zip file?
2009-05-16T18:32:00.000Z	jtaji	dominoeffekt	type that in terminal or Alt+F2 box, then open your zip with open file...
