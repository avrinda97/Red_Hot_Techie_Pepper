2007-03-18T13:41:00.000Z	varsendaggr		 ctfish so far i have heard that there are alot of people with the problem...
2007-03-18T13:41:00.000Z	varsendaggr	ctfish	regular usb wired
2007-03-18T13:42:00.000Z	varsendaggr		it was working an hour ago
2007-03-18T13:42:00.000Z	ctfish	varsendaggr	I haven't been doing much with ubuntu lately - what's the problem, exactly :P
2007-03-18T13:43:00.000Z	varsendaggr	ctfish	i upgraded fro dapper to edgy   and i restarted my computer and then no internet....    server not found
2007-03-18T13:43:00.000Z	ctfish	varsendaggr	what model network card do you have?
2007-03-18T13:44:00.000Z	varsendaggr		it is an actiontec    and it plugs into usb
2007-03-18T13:44:00.000Z	ctfish	varsendaggr	do you know what driver it uses?
2007-03-18T13:44:00.000Z	ctfish	varsendaggr	or kernel module?
2007-03-18T13:45:00.000Z	varsendaggr		i guess not.....    how do i figure that out?
2007-03-18T13:46:00.000Z	varsendaggr		how about this...    once i find out what network driver i have and or kernal mod    how do i fix it?

2007-03-18T13:47:00.000Z	varsendaggr		gosh   it was working before....     this sucks
2007-03-18T13:47:00.000Z	ctfish	varsendaggr	I googled actiontec, and all I could find is wireless networking
