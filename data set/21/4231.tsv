2008-06-11T12:52:00.000Z	fsckd	Chloe	whats wrong
2008-06-11T12:53:00.000Z	Chloe		I got several problems with Xorg "not saving" and recovering an old config file
2008-06-11T12:53:00.000Z	Chloe		I also got problem setting up a Genius pen and table
2008-06-11T12:55:00.000Z	fsckd		Chloe can you be a little more descriptive about your xorg problem
2008-06-11T12:56:00.000Z	Chloe		ok well I can "pastebin" the current config it's working but if I uncomment some lines it doesn't work anymore
2008-06-11T12:56:00.000Z	Chloe		I would need a testparm for Xorg
2008-06-11T12:57:00.000Z	Chloe	fsckd	if I pastebin will you be able to help?
2008-06-11T12:57:00.000Z	fsckd		Chloe Sure
2008-06-11T12:58:00.000Z	Chloe		thanks fsckd give me a few minutes to gather the informations
2008-06-11T12:58:00.000Z	fsckd		Chloe ok and for the tablet you can try https://help.ubuntu.com/community/TabletSetupWizardpen
2008-06-11T12:59:00.000Z	Chloe	fsckd	I am stuck on that howto badly
2008-06-11T12:59:00.000Z	Chloe		I go something to investigate about Xorg 7.3 and that driver
2008-06-11T13:01:00.000Z	fsckd		Chloe did it work in 7.10 or 7.04
2008-06-11T13:02:00.000Z	Chloe	fsckd	I basically got problem with the tablet but an error that I fixed yesterday in the xorg came back today as if the display server got back to a previous config due to an incorrect shutdown or something
2008-06-11T13:03:00.000Z	Chloe	fsckd	here is my xorg.conf http://paste.ubuntu-fr-secours.org/source-716.html
2008-06-11T13:03:00.000Z	Chloe		if I uncomment the tablet part I get to the "default" config screen
2008-06-11T13:06:00.000Z	fsckd		Chloe after you edit your xorg.conf did you run a sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
2008-06-11T13:06:00.000Z	Chloe		I am going to try that fsckd thanks
2008-06-11T13:06:00.000Z	fsckd		Chloe ok
2008-06-11T13:07:00.000Z	Chloe	fsckd	I ll come back and paste you the Xorg.log if it doesn't owrk
