2009-04-28T01:11:00.000Z	rebel_1		does this http://66.160.144.212:8080/ work for anybody ?
2009-04-28T01:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rebel_1	he connection was refused when attempting to contact 66.160.144.212:8080.
2009-04-28T01:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rebel_1	make sure the system you are forwarding to is on static ip
2009-04-28T01:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rebel_1	do you use a router?
2009-04-28T01:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rebel_1	have you configured virtual server / port forwarding?
2009-04-28T01:14:00.000Z	rebel_1	ActionParsnip	nope
2009-04-28T01:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rebel_1	 thats why
2009-04-28T01:14:00.000Z	rebel_1	ActionParsnip	so how to do that ?
2009-04-28T01:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rebel_1	your router is dropping the connection as you havent told it to allow the data and to give it to an ip address, you need to set it to static so it never changes
2009-04-28T01:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rebel_1	you need to read your routers manual or hunt around, it varys wildly from router to router
2009-04-28T01:16:00.000Z	rebel_1	ActionParsnip	ok, but what exactly I'm looking for here ? virtual server configuration ?
2009-04-28T01:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rebel_1	yes, in your routers setup pages
2009-04-28T01:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rebel_1	well you need to add a rule for port 8080 for TCP protocol  to forward to the ip address of your sever on the same port
2009-04-28T01:21:00.000Z	rebel_1	ActionParsnip	ok done everything except entering the IP address... what IP address I should use ? my pc LAN IP adress ?
2009-04-28T01:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rebel_1	yes, the ip address of the pc to forward to
2009-04-28T01:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rebel_1	and use the same port number
2009-04-28T01:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rebel_1	make that pc have a static ip (not dhcp) or it may get a different IP address one day and sever the link
2009-04-28T01:26:00.000Z	rebel_1	ActionParsnip	ok, I guess I've done everything correct, but still can't go to http://66.160.144.212:8080/
2009-04-28T01:27:00.000Z	rebel_1	ActionParsnip	should I reboot the router or something ?
2009-04-28T01:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rebel_1	you may have to
2009-04-28T01:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rebel_1	if it doesnt work, you will need to re-evaluate the settings
