2011-11-28T03:51:00.000Z	Timewarper		i want to run    dd /dev/urandom /dev/sdb       but also see the progress of the proccess. any ideas?
2011-11-28T03:51:00.000Z	apwbdjp	Timewarper	on another terminal, do this: watch killall -USR1 dd
2011-11-28T03:51:00.000Z	apwbdjp	Timewarper	this will make dd print it's progress every 2 seconds
2011-11-28T04:04:00.000Z	Timewarper	apwbdjp	how does this watch killall -USR1 dd print progress every 2 seconds
2011-11-28T04:05:00.000Z	apwbdjp	Timewarper	if you check in man dd, it says that if dd is sent the USR1 signal, it prints its progress, the keeps on going. So we just send that signal to all dd instances with killall, watch is just a way of repeating this periodically
2011-11-28T04:06:00.000Z	Timewarper	apwbdjp	doesnt dd support verbose mode? printing itself its progress?
2011-11-28T04:07:00.000Z	apwbdjp	Timewarper	no, I don't know why actually..
2011-11-28T04:07:00.000Z	apwbdjp	Timewarper	check out man dd, there's a lot in there
2011-11-28T04:08:00.000Z	Timewarper	apwbdjp	kk thanks
2011-11-28T04:16:00.000Z	Timewarper	apwbdjp	by the way  some told me
2011-11-28T04:18:00.000Z	apwbdjp	Timewarper	I never heard of pv, but if it's a way to measure the size of that data that flows through it, then it might be a clever idea
2011-11-28T04:20:00.000Z	Timewarper	apwbdjp	from googling it seems to monitor data through a pipeline
2011-11-28T04:20:00.000Z	apwbdjp	Timewarper	right! pv is a pipeviewer, whatever data it recieves, it'll output it back to the next pipe, but will also print (through stderr I believe) the size of the datas that are flowing through it
2011-11-28T04:21:00.000Z	apwbdjp	Timewarper	I'd find it weird that it has a progress bar, since it doesn't know the size of the hard drive
2011-11-28T04:22:00.000Z	Timewarper	apwbdjp	thats according to the command description from a linux site
2011-11-28T04:23:00.000Z	Timewarper	apwbdjp	but you can measure the ETA + make a % done  from the output of USR1
2011-11-28T04:23:00.000Z	apwbdjp	Timewarper	You can measure it because you know the size of the hard drive, so you know how much left there is to be done
2011-11-28T04:24:00.000Z	apwbdjp	Timewarper	even dd doesn't know that until /dev/sdb says it's full
2011-11-28T04:25:00.000Z	Timewarper	apwbdjp	also i think piping through pv will maybe make an already slow proccess, even slower
2011-11-28T04:25:00.000Z	apwbdjp	Timewarper	pv is estetically better, refreshes better and is faster to do, but I believe asking dd about what it's doing is better
2011-11-28T04:25:00.000Z	apwbdjp	Timewarper	anytime
