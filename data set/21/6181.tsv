2008-08-22T22:45:00.000Z	ykphuah		if I want to transfer my downloaded debs to another machine and install it, can I just copy the whole /var/cache/apt/archives/partial over?
2008-08-22T22:45:00.000Z	Flannel	ykphuah	not partial, and you might be interested with aptoncd
2008-08-22T22:46:00.000Z	ykphuah	Flannel	ok, /var/cache/apt/archives/*.deb?
2008-08-22T22:55:00.000Z	ykphuah	Flannel	any advantages for aptoncd vs just copying /var/cache/apt/archives/*.deb?
2008-08-22T22:56:00.000Z	Flannel	ykphuah	Its more automatic, you have assured dependency satisfaction, etc.
2008-08-22T23:01:00.000Z	ykphuah	Flannel	actually, I just want to keep all the downloaded debs just in case I need to reinstall my ubuntu, I do not need to download the 100+megs update again via my slow EDGE connection. Using a CD for that seems an overkill, since I can just transfer the files from hd to hd. By right if I copy all the debs that I downloaded, it will sort of solve the dependancy tree by itself right? Since I am starting from the base system in both scenarios.
2008-08-22T23:02:00.000Z	Flannel	ykphuah	yeah, just copy /var/cache/apt/
2008-08-22T23:03:00.000Z	ykphuah	Flannel	will it work if I just copy all the contents from /var/cache/apt to a newly installed 8.04 and it will install from the harddisk instead of downloading from the internet when I do an upgrade?
2008-08-22T23:04:00.000Z	Flannel	ykphuah	yeah, it'll notice that it has those packages, and then do its thing.
2008-08-22T23:04:00.000Z	ykphuah	Flannel	ok thanks a lot.
2008-08-22T23:16:00.000Z	Flannel	ykphuah	The root account is locked, sudo doesn't use it.  The user password is used by sudo.
2008-08-22T23:19:00.000Z	ykphuah	Flannel	well, if I have just sudo-ed recently, and sudo keeps the password for 15 minutes, basically it means if any virus comes in thru my emails or something, and the malware does a "sudo rm /" it will run without prompting me for password, right?
2008-08-22T23:20:00.000Z	Flannel	ykphuah	please don't post commands like that here, ever.
2008-08-22T23:20:00.000Z	ykphuah	Flannel	oops, sorry about that.
2008-08-22T23:21:00.000Z	Flannel	ykphuah	sudo's caching is five minutes by default, and its not system wide either (one shell doesn't know what the other is doing)
2008-08-22T23:23:00.000Z	ykphuah	Flannel	ah, I get what you mean, so any programs that run sudo need to be prompted interactively for my password. And there's no way for a program running as myself to escalate its own to root, right?
2008-08-22T23:24:00.000Z	Flannel	ykphuah	not on its own, no.
2008-08-22T23:35:00.000Z	ykphuah	Flannel	will that be kde 3 or 4? in kubuntu-desktop?
2008-08-22T23:36:00.000Z	Flannel	ykphuah	3.5, 4 is kubuntu-kde4-desktop
2008-09-12T21:45:00.000Z	Flannel	ykphuah	You may have more luck in #ubuntu-motu
2008-09-12T21:46:00.000Z	ykphuah	Flannel	ok thanks
