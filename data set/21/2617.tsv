2009-08-17T16:56:00.000Z	jwyg		does anyone know where i might be able to look for documentation on psmouse module?
2009-08-17T16:57:00.000Z	hbekel	jwyg	the kernel sources, if it's included in the kernel, see the /Documentation dir
2009-08-17T16:57:00.000Z	hbekel	jwyg	modinfo psmouse might help as well
2009-08-17T16:58:00.000Z	jwyg		hbekel:many thanks! will look now!
2009-08-17T17:01:00.000Z	jwyg	hbekel	i'm trying to undo 'modprobe -r psmouse' and 'modprobe psmouse proto=imps' any ideas?
2009-08-17T17:01:00.000Z	hbekel	jwyg	ideas about what?
2009-08-17T17:02:00.000Z	jwyg		about how to reset to default?
2009-08-17T17:02:00.000Z	jwyg		my keyboard and mouse are disabled
2009-08-17T17:03:00.000Z	jwyg	hbekel	about how to reset them to their default? i've managed to lock myself out of my keyboard and trackpad!
2009-08-17T17:04:00.000Z	hbekel	jwyg	the psmouse module probably has nothing to do with it
2009-08-17T17:04:00.000Z	hbekel	jwyg	it's rather xorg i'd guess
2009-08-17T17:04:00.000Z	jwyg	hbekel	i think it does - see http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=7800070
2009-08-17T17:04:00.000Z	jwyg	hbekel	after reset it stopped working
2009-08-17T17:05:00.000Z	jwyg	hbekel	and now i'm trying to undo what i did as root in safe mode
2009-08-17T17:06:00.000Z	hbekel	jwyg	to undo the proto action you can 'modprobe -r psmouse; and modprobe psmouse' again
2009-08-17T17:06:00.000Z	hbekel	jwyg	that should use only the options (if any) defined via the modprobe.conf mechanism
2009-08-17T17:09:00.000Z	jwyg	hbekel	thanks for your advice - i just tried it and the keyboard and tracker are still disabled...
2009-08-17T17:11:00.000Z	jwyg	hbekel	i'll try just disabling psmouse
2009-08-17T17:11:00.000Z	jwyg	hbekel	perhaps its not enabled at all by default
2009-08-17T17:12:00.000Z	hbekel	jwyg	hmm, no idea, sorry. got to go, too...
2009-08-17T17:12:00.000Z	jwyg	hbekel	thanks for your help!
