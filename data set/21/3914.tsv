2009-02-26T16:22:00.000Z	Yaron		there's no answer in ubuntu-server so i'll consult you guys about the bug
2009-02-26T16:23:00.000Z	Yaron		I booted from cd
2009-02-26T16:23:00.000Z	Yaron		I selected a keymap (Hebrew)
2009-02-26T16:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Yaron	did yu md5 check the iso before you burned it as well as checking the cd was ok at the first bootup screen?
2009-02-26T16:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Yaron	which, both?
2009-02-26T16:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Yaron	md5 checks and checking the cd is hugely important
2009-02-26T16:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Yaron	its worth checking so you can rule it out as the cause
2009-02-26T16:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Yaron	oic
2009-02-26T16:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Yaron	let me websearch
2009-02-26T16:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Yaron	so do you have something like this: http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-il@cs.huji.ac.il/msg47241.html
2009-02-26T16:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Yaron	here is my xorg.con with default options: http://pastebin.com/f7e8b9298
2009-02-26T16:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Yaron	hmm, you could ssh in maybe
2009-02-26T16:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Yaron	i think sshd is installed by default
2009-02-26T16:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Yaron	ive never heard anyone else experience this, does it do it every install? Maybe you could rerun the cd then see if it autoselects hebrew, then try to re-select a different language
2009-02-26T16:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Yaron	not sure, if its wrong Im sure it will be moved
2009-02-26T16:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Yaron	you could boot to a bootable cd of some other kind (desktop ubuntu, even gentoo minimal will do) and edit the xorg.conf file
2009-02-26T16:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Yaron	then put that in your bug report
2009-02-26T16:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Yaron	i think you are right
2009-02-26T16:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Yaron	installer maybe
2009-02-26T16:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Yaron	sure
2009-02-26T16:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Yaron	if its wrong it will be moved
