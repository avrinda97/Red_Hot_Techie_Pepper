2010-11-05T23:02:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila		Hey, I need help with my wireless. I installed some updates, rebooted and my laptop didn't find the wireless anymore. All the other laptops get the connection. Rebooting doesn't work. Here's my wireless' specs: http://pastebin.com/SSfQELiU

2010-11-05T23:03:00.000Z	philinux	JohnHeikkila	I would delete the wireless settings under network manager and then add back.
2010-11-05T23:10:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	philinux	Yeah, but that wouldn't work for my laptop can't find any wireless networks
2010-11-05T23:11:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	philinux	"sudo iwlist scan" shows "no scan results"
2010-11-05T23:11:00.000Z	philinux	JohnHeikkila	Ah right you mean it dont even detect any.  Ok try reboting and at grub choose the older kernel
2010-11-05T23:12:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	philinux	Sure, I'll try it.
2010-11-05T23:12:00.000Z	philinux	JohnHeikkila	Connect it wired and try to update
2010-11-05T23:12:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	philinux	I am connected to a wire
2010-11-05T23:12:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila		d
2010-11-05T23:12:00.000Z	philinux		:p
2010-11-05T23:12:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	philinux	But what exactly should I update? apt-get update, upgrade do nothibf
2010-11-05T23:12:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	philinux	*nothing
2010-11-05T23:13:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	philinux	Any ideas before I boot to an older kernel?
2010-11-05T23:13:00.000Z	philinux	JohnHeikkila	Has this machine only got buntu on it
2010-11-05T23:13:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	philinux	Yes
2010-11-05T23:13:00.000Z	philinux	JohnHeikkila	You might have accidently knocked the wirlesss switch on the lappy
2010-11-05T23:14:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	philinux	No, besides the reboot would have dealt with that (my laptop has a button for wireless, not switch)
2010-11-05T23:14:00.000Z	philinux	JohnHeikkila	Try an older kernel. And try the livecd
2010-11-05T23:14:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	philinux	And my network manager shows if it's disabled
2010-11-05T23:14:00.000Z	JohnHeikkila	philinux	Sure, brb
