2011-01-22T14:15:00.000Z	ciphergoth	wmorri	ah, that helps: my question now becomes "why don't I see the install alongside other operating systems option?"
2011-01-22T14:02:00.000Z	wmorri	ciphergoth	what are all the options that it is giving you? You should have more than one?
2011-01-22T14:02:00.000Z	ciphergoth	wmorri	erase the entire disk, or manual partitioning
2011-01-22T14:03:00.000Z	wmorri	ciphergoth	hmm, not sure atm let me look something up
2011-01-22T14:03:00.000Z	ciphergoth	wmorri	thanks
2011-01-22T14:04:00.000Z	wmorri	ciphergoth	do you have any extra space available or is it all being used but XP?
2011-01-22T14:05:00.000Z	wmorri	ciphergoth	if wost comes to worst we can walk you through partitioning it
2011-01-22T14:07:00.000Z	ciphergoth	wmorri	right now XP fills the disk
2011-01-22T14:08:00.000Z	wmorri	ciphergoth	do you want to use the entire disk or just part of it?
2011-01-22T14:09:00.000Z	ciphergoth	wmorri	I want to shrink the XP partition to half its size and use the other half for Ubuntu
2011-01-22T14:10:00.000Z	wmorri	ciphergoth	yes it was and should be there. I am not sure why it isn't there now.
2011-01-22T14:12:00.000Z	wmorri	ciphergoth	that shouldn't be the case as it is a livecd and they run off ram
2011-01-22T14:13:00.000Z	ciphergoth	wmorri	right, but it does examine my system to decide what to do
2011-01-22T14:14:00.000Z	wmorri	ciphergoth	I understand what you are saying, but I also agree with arkani. you can manually set up the partition. it isn't too hard.
2011-01-22T14:14:00.000Z	wmorri	ciphergoth	have a look at this
2011-01-22T14:14:00.000Z	ciphergoth	wmorri	the manual partition editor doesn't have an option to shrink NTFS partitions
2011-01-22T14:17:00.000Z	wmorri	ciphergoth	see what happens you might surprise yourself
2011-01-22T14:17:00.000Z	ciphergoth	wmorri	see what happens when what?
2011-01-22T14:19:00.000Z	wmorri	ciphergoth	I C that is definitely a problem
2011-01-22T14:23:00.000Z	wmorri	ciphergoth	sorry we couldn't help you. You can report a bug here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs
