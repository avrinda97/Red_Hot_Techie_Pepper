2007-11-19T19:13:00.000Z	z1pp3r		and "will break your system" issues
2007-11-19T19:15:00.000Z	z1pp3r		then i dont understand what you're disputing =/

2007-11-19T19:18:00.000Z	z1pp3r		personally i dont think its that bad, but it's a channel policy not to recommend it
2007-11-19T19:20:00.000Z	z1pp3r		well i can understand that, a waste of time for a newbie to read docs they dont understand
2007-11-19T19:20:00.000Z	z1pp3r		better just to tell them what and how they should do it
2007-11-19T19:20:00.000Z	z1pp3r		if possible
2007-11-19T19:21:00.000Z	z1pp3r		possible, if you know yourself =)
2007-11-19T19:21:00.000Z	z1pp3r		there was a 3d video made a year ago or so, only using open source tools.... damn, what was the name of that again...
2007-11-19T19:22:00.000Z	z1pp3r		maybe you can find it on blenders website

2009-02-19T19:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	z1pp3r	sounds like a real "kernel panic" aka "bsod of linux". do the leds of the keyboard flash when the crash occurs?
2009-02-19T19:43:00.000Z	z1pp3r	erUSUL	I'm pretty sure they dont. Is there a log file where i can find the 'dmesg' of the last boot or something? As it is, its kindda hard to figure out whats wrong
2009-02-19T19:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	z1pp3r	/var/log/messages
2009-02-19T20:04:00.000Z	z1pp3r	erUSUL	Hmm, i wasn't really able to find anything in the logs that could explain why my system crashes. I did find this in the 'messages' log though: "kernel: [    0.400252] mtrr: your CPUs had inconsistent fixed MTRR settings"
2009-02-19T20:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	z1pp3r	may be a harmless warning...
2009-02-19T20:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	z1pp3r	some crashess do not leave any trace...
2009-02-19T20:06:00.000Z	z1pp3r	erUSUL	Hmm, makes it pretty hard to debug =/
2009-02-19T20:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	z1pp3r	one option you have is to install linux-backports-modules maybe the backported module (driver for the wifi) does not crash the machine
2009-02-19T20:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	z1pp3r	other option is to try out other kernel versions (older or newer from proposed)
2009-02-19T20:14:00.000Z	z1pp3r	erUSUL	okay.... i'll try that
