2009-08-27T22:57:00.000Z	Agony_		Where should I go for a question regarding an external hard drive?
2009-08-27T22:58:00.000Z	Anarhist	Agony_	are they very small files?
2009-08-27T22:59:00.000Z	Agony_	Anarhist	No, they're mostly 700Mb .avi files
2009-08-27T22:59:00.000Z	Anarhist	Agony_	what file system?
2009-08-27T23:00:00.000Z	Agony_	Anarhist	fat32
2009-08-27T23:02:00.000Z	Anarhist	Agony_	that is strange, you should check the drive, but best do it under windows
2009-08-27T23:03:00.000Z	Agony_	Anarhist	I don't have access to a Windows system to check it on
2009-08-27T23:04:00.000Z	Agony_	Anarhist	This is a single boot Ubuntu system. I'd format the drive, but I don't have space to back up what's on it onto the laptop
2009-08-27T23:05:00.000Z	Anarhist	Agony_	can you access every directory fine?
2009-08-27T23:05:00.000Z	Agony_	Anarhist	Yes, and I've checked the directories, there is definitely no more than 101Gb of files in them, total, and no hidden files
2009-08-27T23:08:00.000Z	Anarhist	Agony_	you can try fsck.vfat
2009-08-27T23:08:00.000Z	Agony_	Anarhist	How would I do that?
2009-08-27T23:09:00.000Z	Anarhist	Agony_	man fsck.vfat will give you the useage
2009-08-27T23:10:00.000Z	Agony_	Anarhist	Would I just type "man fsck.vfat" into a terminal, or what? Sorry, I'm not very familiar with fsck
2009-08-27T23:11:00.000Z	Anarhist	Agony_	yes, if you type "man fsck.vfat" and press enter in the terminal it will give you a manual page for it
2009-08-27T23:12:00.000Z	Anarhist	Agony_	your command will look something like fsck.vfat -a /dev/DEVICE NAME
2009-08-27T23:12:00.000Z	Anarhist	Agony_	sorry it will be "sudo fsck.vfat -a /dev/..."
2009-08-27T23:13:00.000Z	Agony_	Anarhist	Yeah, I assumed I'd need SU priveliges to carry out a fsck
2009-08-27T23:16:00.000Z	Agony_	Anarhist	It says the device is mounted at /media/DEVICE NAME, do I still want to look for it in /dev/ or just use the /media mount point?
2009-08-27T23:16:00.000Z	Anarhist	Agony_	you want to unmount it first, and then do /dev/...
2009-08-27T23:24:00.000Z	Anarhist	Agony_	i'm leaving, hopefully this will help
