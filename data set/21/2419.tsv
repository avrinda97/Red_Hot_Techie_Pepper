2011-12-07T02:52:00.000Z	og01	xrandr	I just updated my system to 11.10 and now it wont boot
2011-12-07T02:53:00.000Z	xrandr	og01	have you backed up all your personal files?
2011-12-07T02:53:00.000Z	og01	xrandr	I get past the crypt key page
2011-12-07T02:53:00.000Z	og01	xrandr	the raid array contains most my useufll stuff and should be recoverable - but no essentaily I want to get to my data
2011-12-07T02:54:00.000Z	xrandr	og01	how did you upgrade? And have you tried a clean install?
2011-12-07T02:54:00.000Z	og01	xrandr	I upgraded via the update manager
2011-12-07T02:54:00.000Z	xrandr	og01	well, you could always do a clean install.
2011-12-07T02:54:00.000Z	og01	xrandr	I want to try to recover data before doint a clean install
2011-12-07T02:55:00.000Z	xrandr	og01	well, in your raid, did you create a separate partition for /home ?
2011-12-07T02:55:00.000Z	og01	xrandr	the raid array isnt part of the main filesystem
2011-12-07T02:56:00.000Z	og01	xrandr	1 have 1 drive for boot/root and 4 drives that are mounted seperatly and non-critical for boot
2011-12-07T02:56:00.000Z	og01	xrandr	the boot drive is crypted
2011-12-07T02:56:00.000Z	xrandr	og01	oy! Im not sure i can help you there
2011-12-07T02:57:00.000Z	og01	xrandr	it claims to successfully decrypt the drive after a successfull key enty
