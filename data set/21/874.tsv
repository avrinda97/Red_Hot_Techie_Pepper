2011-04-29T06:44:00.000Z	Herbs		Linux is a shell the gui is just a frontend for the shell you can use any you want so why moan
2011-04-29T06:44:00.000Z	ohsix	Herbs	linux is a kernel, what you think of the shell is probably a getty on one of the virtual terminals
2011-04-29T07:30:00.000Z	ohsix	Herbs	that is offtopic
2011-04-29T07:30:00.000Z	ohsix	Herbs	this is a support channel
2011-04-29T07:32:00.000Z	ohsix	Herbs	"i don't use, but isn't it buggy"
2011-04-29T07:32:00.000Z	ohsix	Herbs	that's not a fact, and shouldn't be presented as such, that is your apparently not personally informed opinion
2011-04-29T07:33:00.000Z	ohsix	Herbs	please, if you don't have any questions or need any help, don't speak; there are lots of people talking
2011-04-29T07:34:00.000Z	ohsix	Herbs	one need not ask; this is a help channel, and we all know it
2011-04-29T07:35:00.000Z	ohsix	Herbs	please, if you don't have any questions or need any help, don't speak; there are lots of people talking
2011-04-29T07:39:00.000Z	ohsix	Herbs	this is a help channel, it's not a free speech thing, what you are doing right now is completely antithetical to what the channel is, and you don't even suggest that you are here to get support for a problem you are having; that annoys people
2011-04-29T07:41:00.000Z	ohsix	Herbs	do you need help? i simply asked you to stop speaking if you don't need help, there are already a lot of people talking
2011-04-29T07:41:00.000Z	ohsix	Herbs	is that a question?
2011-04-29T07:53:00.000Z	ohsix	Herbs	no need for ad hominem or calling people names, if you have a question ask it; or please be quiet, or take your outbursts to #ubuntu-offtopic
2011-04-29T07:54:00.000Z	ohsix	Herbs	i didn't even say what she said; and it doesn't matter
2011-04-29T07:57:00.000Z	ohsix	Herbs	do you have a question, please take your outbursts elsewhere
2011-04-29T08:12:00.000Z	Herbs	ohsix	why should he add a repo because you say?
2011-04-29T08:14:00.000Z	ohsix	Herbs	it contains updated drivers, it is semi official in ubuntu, they have a bleeding edge and stable driver update ppa; and all the people rolling packages in it are ubuntu developers
2011-04-29T08:15:00.000Z	Herbs	ohsix	thats cool maybe mention it though
2011-04-29T08:15:00.000Z	ohsix	Herbs	that elaboration was for you, i didn't need to justify suggesting it
2011-04-29T08:16:00.000Z	Herbs	ohsix	why not if we carry on in this way we will be more insucure than windows
2011-04-29T08:17:00.000Z	ohsix	Herbs	sure why not, it's not as if ppa's aren't signed by the uploader like any other pakcage
