2009-06-23T01:08:00.000Z	randall		I need help getting rid of a search applet on my desktop. There doesnt seem to be any way to remove it and its there every time i log in.
2009-06-23T01:10:00.000Z	taxman	randall	what applet and how did you install it?
2009-06-23T01:11:00.000Z	randall	taxman	i didnt install it that i know of
2009-06-23T01:12:00.000Z	randall	taxman	i think it might be a gnome built in search applet or something
2009-06-23T01:12:00.000Z	taxman	randall	usually you can right click on those and remove them
2009-06-23T01:12:00.000Z	randall	taxman	right click does nothing visible
2009-06-23T01:13:00.000Z	randall	taxman	it stays on top of other windows, and is only on my first desktop
2009-06-23T01:13:00.000Z	taxman	randall	can you get the app to do anything at all that shows what it is? If not, try making a screenshot and I think you can send that to a pastebin
2009-06-23T01:14:00.000Z	randall	taxman	i can type in the search field, and there is a small white triangle that looks like it should be a drop down menu but i think its broken.
2009-06-23T01:14:00.000Z	randall	taxman	where should i post the screen shot?
2009-06-23T01:16:00.000Z	randall	taxman	can i post screenshots on pastebin?!
2009-06-23T01:16:00.000Z	randall	taxman	way cool!

2009-06-23T01:21:00.000Z	taxman	randall	I have no idea, but I had a thought. Right click on your top panel and add the force quit applet. Then do ps -ef > 1.out then kill the search thing, then do ps -ef >2.out and compare the two files until you find what's different and what is the app that you killed. Not a sure thing, and definitely tedious, but I can't think of a faster way off the top of my head
2009-06-23T01:24:00.000Z	randall	taxman	ps -ef > 1.out doesnt display anything
2009-06-23T01:24:00.000Z	taxman	randall	right, that sends it straight to the file named 1.out
2009-06-23T01:25:00.000Z	randall	taxman	how do i kill the process
2009-06-23T01:25:00.000Z	taxman	randall	use the force-quit applet, it gives you a gui way to click on it and kill it
2009-06-23T01:27:00.000Z	randall	taxman	so the force quit conformation, it popped up *under* the app >.<
2009-06-23T01:28:00.000Z	randall	taxman	lol ok killed it thank you for your gelp
2009-06-23T01:28:00.000Z	taxman	randall	sure. Hopefully, you'll be able to tell from the ps outputs
