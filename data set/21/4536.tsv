2008-04-08T05:11:00.000Z	rdg		is there anything I can do to encourage the installer to find my DVD drive it just booted off of?
2008-04-08T05:11:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	rdg	detect it with what?
2008-04-08T05:11:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	rdg	for what?
2008-04-08T05:12:00.000Z	rdg		I'm trying to install the latest ubuntu from iso (alternative).. it booted, launched the installer, then said it couldn't mount my CD after detecting keyboard
2008-04-08T05:14:00.000Z	rdg		any thoughts on that Seven_Six_Two
2008-04-08T05:14:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	rdg	does it throw a specific error?
2008-04-08T05:15:00.000Z	rdg		just says "Your installation CD couldn't be mounted"
2008-04-08T05:16:00.000Z	rdg	Seven_Six_Two	 mount -t iso9660 /dev/scd0 /cdrom/     returns a "invalid argument"
2008-04-08T05:17:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	rdg	is it a pata drive?
2008-04-08T05:18:00.000Z	rdg	Seven_Six_Two	I was pretty sure it was SATA.. let me crack open the case
2008-04-08T05:18:00.000Z	rdg		yea it's sata
2008-04-08T05:18:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	rdg	oh if you think it is, then that sounds right
2008-04-08T05:19:00.000Z	rdg	Seven_Six_Two	there a solution?
2008-04-08T05:19:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	rdg	/mount exists?
2008-04-08T05:20:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	rdg	is that the command that the installer uses?
2008-04-08T05:20:00.000Z	rdg	Seven_Six_Two	/mount? no..     I ran %  mount -t iso9660 /dev/scd0 /cdrom
2008-04-08T05:21:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	rdg	can you do it with sudo?
2008-04-08T05:21:00.000Z	rdg	Seven_Six_Two	I'm in the console during the installer.. there is no sudo
2008-04-08T05:23:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	rdg	sorry to waste your time rdg, I'm not sure what could be happening. I have never used that installer.
2008-04-08T05:23:00.000Z	rdg	Seven_Six_Two	no sweat and not a waste of time. any attempt at help is appreciated
2008-04-08T05:24:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	rdg	np
