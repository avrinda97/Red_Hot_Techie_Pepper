2008-06-11T14:10:00.000Z	chrols		Hello, my Firefox can't connect to anywhere. I've checked that the proxy is right and also after I found some advice on google disabled ipv6, however it didn't seem to help. I can't even visit sites on the LAN when I punch in the iP. Anyone got any suggestion?
2008-06-11T14:11:00.000Z	rohan	chrols	what error do you get when you try?
2008-06-11T14:12:00.000Z	chrols	rohan	It takes a long while and after that I get the standard "Can not connect page"
2008-06-11T14:13:00.000Z	chrols	rohan	"The requested adress is not responding..." albeit localized
2008-06-11T14:13:00.000Z	rohan	chrols	strange. does NetworkManager report as connected?
2008-06-11T14:14:00.000Z	chrols	rohan	Yes, everything else works.
2008-06-11T14:15:00.000Z	chrols	rohan	Pidgin, Skype, xchat, etc etc. Epiphany works well for browsing
2008-06-11T14:15:00.000Z	rohan	chrols	strange, did it happen after the update to ff3rc1?
2008-06-11T14:16:00.000Z	chrols	rohan	No, it wasn't in conjunction to any upgrade things broke. But it is ff3rc1.
2008-06-11T14:16:00.000Z	rohan	chrols	ok, then what exactly happened, that caused it to stop working?
2008-06-11T14:16:00.000Z	rohan	chrols	can you make a new user and try?
2008-06-11T14:17:00.000Z	chrols	rohan	Well I used to connect with a router but now my machine is directly connected which made me suspect faulty proxy settings, but it's set to direct connect
2008-06-11T14:18:00.000Z	rohan	chrols	as i said, could you try making a new user?
2008-06-11T14:26:00.000Z	rohan	chrols	i'm sorry, you said anything? my net is problematic
2008-06-11T14:26:00.000Z	chrols	rohan	Didn't say anything =)
2008-06-11T14:30:00.000Z	rohan	chrols	so, the problem is solved?
2008-06-11T14:33:00.000Z	chrols	rohan	Sorry about not answering but my problem is more or less solved
2008-06-11T14:33:00.000Z	rohan	chrols	oh ok
2008-06-11T14:35:00.000Z	chrols	rohan	Thanks for the help
2008-06-11T14:35:00.000Z	rohan	chrols	no problem, i didn't help anyway ;) just curious to know, how was it solved/
2008-06-11T14:37:00.000Z	chrols	rohan	Well turns out it is a problem with the chroot I am running firefox from rather than firefox itself, though strangely it didn't mind the chroot until recently
