2008-02-25T19:37:00.000Z	katzenjammer	bazhang	what do you mean with "ask away"? sorry for my english skills :
2008-02-25T19:37:00.000Z	bazhang	katzenjammer	err sorry please ask your question ;]
2008-02-25T19:38:00.000Z	katzenjammer	bazhang	yesterday my audio worked fine. today i started out ubuntu and found it not working at all. the speaker icon on the top bar is signed with a X and i cant do anything
2008-02-25T19:39:00.000Z	bazhang	katzenjammer	open a terminal and type alsamixer and make sure it is not muted
2008-02-25T19:39:00.000Z	katzenjammer	bazhang	alsamixer does not work. it returns "alsamixer: function snd_ctl_open failed for default: No such device"
2008-02-25T19:50:00.000Z	katzenjammer	bazhang	any idea?
2008-02-25T19:50:00.000Z	bazhang	katzenjammer	what sound card do you have? should be listed in lspci
2008-02-25T19:51:00.000Z	katzenjammer	bazhang	Audio device: nVidia Corporation MCP61 High Definition Audio (rev a2)       (it should be a realtek integrated one)
2008-02-25T19:52:00.000Z	bazhang	katzenjammer	is is possible there are two sound cards on that system--that one and the realtek?
2008-02-25T19:52:00.000Z	katzenjammer	bazhang	no.. i just have that realtek integrated on mainboard (nvidia chipset)
2008-02-25T19:54:00.000Z	katzenjammer	bazhang	yesterday, in the volume control gui, there were 2 choises: the nvidia one, flagged as alsa, and the realtek one, flagged as OSS
2008-02-25T19:57:00.000Z	bazhang	katzenjammer	and which one did you choose?
2008-02-25T19:58:00.000Z	katzenjammer	bazhang	i had the possibility to choose one or the other withoud problems. all worked in both cases
2008-02-25T19:58:00.000Z	katzenjammer	bazhang	now i cant open the volume control gui anymore
2008-02-25T20:00:00.000Z	bazhang	katzenjammer	can you get back to that choice and choose the other option
2008-02-25T20:00:00.000Z	katzenjammer	bazhang	no, cause i cant open the panel
2008-02-25T20:00:00.000Z	bazhang	katzenjammer	the icon in the panel--try right clicking on it still no effect?
2008-02-25T20:02:00.000Z	katzenjammer	bazhang	right click menu pops up, but if i click "open volume control" it gives "No GStreamer plugin or volume control disp found"
2008-02-25T20:06:00.000Z	katzenjammer	bazhang	maybe i should re-install ubuntu? :(
2008-02-25T20:07:00.000Z	bazhang	katzenjammer	nah that is likely not necessary--there are some actual people who know things about sound--just not me ;[
