2009-10-11T03:01:00.000Z	Lake_		when I list partitions with fdisk -l I seem to miss one SATA HDD I recently put in the machine.. I assume I can't see it because the motherboard doesn't see it ?
2009-10-11T03:01:00.000Z	foofish	Lake_	you have to tell fdisk which device to look at
2009-10-11T03:01:00.000Z	foofish	Lake_	e.g. fdisk -l /dev/sdb
2009-10-11T03:02:00.000Z	Lake_	foofish	well by fdisk -l he listed what seems to be all that he can, he listed /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdb2 etc
2009-10-11T03:02:00.000Z	foofish	Lake_	ok
2009-10-11T03:02:00.000Z	Lake_	foofish	so I see no reason for it to miss a whole disk unless it doesn't see it
2009-10-11T03:03:00.000Z	foofish	Lake_	oops, i was looking at the manpage for the bsd fdisk
2009-10-11T03:04:00.000Z	foofish	Lake_	if it's not in the dmesg output, it'll probably be in the bootup messages in the syslog
2009-10-11T03:05:00.000Z	Lake_	foofish	I'll have to google that, it's probably somewhere in /var/log I'd guess
2009-10-11T03:05:00.000Z	foofish	Lake_	yes, /var/log/syslog iirc
2009-10-11T03:26:00.000Z	Lake_	foofish	syslog doesn't even mention the 4th sata hdd, I'm guessing it's a BIOS thing and it's not in dmesg either
2009-10-11T03:27:00.000Z	foofish	Lake_	ok. presumably you have had it recognised by some other operating system
2009-10-11T03:27:00.000Z	foofish	Lake_	and it's not a loose power cable or something
2009-10-11T03:27:00.000Z	Lake_	foofish	no actually not really
2009-10-11T03:28:00.000Z	Lake_	foofish	it's spinning but BIOS doesn't see it so either mobo problem or doa hdd
2009-10-11T03:28:00.000Z	foofish	Lake_	well check the data cable, both ends
2009-10-11T03:28:00.000Z	Lake_	foofish	will do (and maybe mobo has some SATA optino I need to enable, like losha said)
2009-10-11T03:39:00.000Z	Lake_	foofish	well sadly, BIOS option sata is enabled and I data cable is all right so this means try another data cable .. and if that doesn't work, try the hdd in another machine ?
2009-10-11T03:42:00.000Z	foofish	Lake_	guess so
2009-10-11T03:43:00.000Z	Lake_	foofish	...actually do something, you say.... my worse fears realized... thx for your help
2009-10-11T03:43:00.000Z	foofish	Lake_	np
