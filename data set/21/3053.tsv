2010-11-25T21:00:00.000Z	Kingsy		ok this is weird, I have just ran .. sudo apt-get install samba    sudo apt-get install smbfs    and for some reason /etc/init.d/samba start   says command not found..
2010-11-25T21:00:00.000Z	Kingsy		ps aux | grep samba says its not running.... how do I start/restart it??
2010-11-25T21:00:00.000Z	LjL	Kingsy	try "service samba start" instead
2010-11-25T21:01:00.000Z	Kingsy	LjL	- yea I tried that it said unrecognised service samba
2010-11-25T21:01:00.000Z	LjL	Kingsy	uhm. are you quite sure it got installed
2010-11-25T21:01:00.000Z	LjL	Kingsy	give it an "apt-cache policy samba"
2010-11-25T21:03:00.000Z	Kingsy	LjL	yea that says samba installed etc etc candidate number etc
2010-11-25T21:03:00.000Z	Kingsy	LjL	well at least it does return something :)
2010-11-25T21:03:00.000Z	Kingsy	LjL	I wouldnt have to restart the computer would i?
2010-11-25T21:04:00.000Z	LjL	Kingsy	oh, i see the "samba" init script has been removed in maverick
2010-11-25T21:05:00.000Z	LjL	Kingsy	try starting "smbd" and "nmbd" instead
2010-11-25T21:06:00.000Z	Kingsy	LjL	that looks to have started it tho thanks
2010-11-25T21:11:00.000Z	LjL	Kingsy	NetBIOS service
2012-03-12T17:54:00.000Z	LjL	Kingsy	i don't believe you can have ppa.launchpad.net enabled generally, you need a specific ppa repository. you can ignore that error, or if you want to make it go away you can remove the relevant entry from /etc/apt/sources.list or /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
2012-03-12T17:54:00.000Z	Kingsy	LjL	ok
2012-03-12T17:55:00.000Z	Kingsy	LjL	I cant find that url in either sources.list or in any of the files in sources.list.d/
2012-03-12T17:55:00.000Z	LjL	Kingsy	i can't think of any other place
2012-03-12T17:56:00.000Z	Kingsy	LjL	:S what would you recommend then?
2012-03-12T17:56:00.000Z	LjL	Kingsy	are you grepping for "ppa.launchpad.net"?
2012-03-12T17:58:00.000Z	LjL	Kingsy	ah i see, that repository is currently empty.
2012-03-12T17:58:00.000Z	LjL	Kingsy	no idea, but it can't hurt removing it
