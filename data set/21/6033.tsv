2008-12-20T15:54:00.000Z	wers		we have two computers connected to one wifi router at home. how can we share files?
2008-12-20T15:55:00.000Z	Slart	wers	there are many ways.. you can use the windows file sharing protocol with samba, !samba for more info, or try nfs, ftp or any of the others that are available
2009-02-04T19:50:00.000Z	Slart	wers	I don't think there is a repository for the latest flash
2009-02-04T19:51:00.000Z	Slart	wers	are you using 32 or 64 bit ubuntu?
2009-02-04T19:51:00.000Z	Slart	wers	then you can get the latest flash plugin from adobe and install that..but you'll have to be prepared to fix any problems yourself.. going with the one in the repos is always the easiest way
2009-07-06T20:29:00.000Z	wers	Slart	any other rule? no 1 or 0 no avoid?
2009-07-06T20:29:00.000Z	Slart	wers	192.168.X.X should work nicely
2009-07-06T20:30:00.000Z	Slart	wers	192.168.0.1 is a good start.. I don't think you're allowed to have 192.168.0.0  though
2009-07-06T20:31:00.000Z	wers	Slart	got that. just have to avoid having the same ip as other devices. thanks
2009-07-06T20:33:00.000Z	wers	Slart	it also broke my internet access :| if i use more conventional ip adds they dont remain static
2009-07-06T20:34:00.000Z	Slart	wers	try using 192.168.1.1 instead.. 192.168.0.1 is a common default for home routers and such
2009-07-06T21:13:00.000Z	wers	Slart	apparently, i needed a one that is not along my dhcp range. so there are two requirements, something that will remain static and is not along the dhcp range. how do I know? hehe
2009-07-06T21:14:00.000Z	Slart	wers	what ip do you have on your desktop computer? type "ifconfig" in a terminal to find out
2009-07-06T21:15:00.000Z	wers	Slart	10.0.0.2
2009-07-06T21:15:00.000Z	Slart	wers	then go with 10.0.1.1 for your iphone
2009-07-06T21:16:00.000Z	Slart	wers	you can basically change anything but the 10... so 10.2.3.4 would also work
2009-07-06T21:17:00.000Z	wers	Slart	and scunizi thanks :)
2009-07-06T21:18:00.000Z	wers	Slart	cant go online with 10.2.3.4
2009-07-06T21:19:00.000Z	Slart	wers	are you using some kind of router/gateway thingy?
2009-07-06T21:19:00.000Z	wers	Slart	i have a wifi router connected to a wired router which is connected to my dsl
2009-07-06T21:20:00.000Z	Slart	wers	it's probably something that the router is doing then
