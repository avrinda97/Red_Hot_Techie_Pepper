2011-03-07T03:48:00.000Z	Guest68553		you wouldnt happen to know why i cant video chat with msn users?
2011-03-07T03:48:00.000Z	needlez	Guest68553	what are you using to chat with msn users??
2011-03-07T03:50:00.000Z	needlez	Guest68553	you should try using aMSN, and set it so that its set to the camera v4linux2 or v4linux something like that should be installed also
2011-03-07T03:52:00.000Z	needlez	Guest68553	yes if its not already installed, but it should be, second make sure the client / program your using is set to the same output as the camera
2011-03-07T03:54:00.000Z	needlez	Guest68553	are you sure you camera will work with linux??
2011-03-07T03:57:00.000Z	needlez	Guest68553	if it doesn't work under chesse that would explain why it closes
2011-03-07T03:59:00.000Z	needlez	Guest68553	open up cheese and see if you see your picture on the camera if so, now try connecting thru amsn or whatever youre using
2011-03-07T03:59:00.000Z	needlez	Guest68553	also make sure under settings youve selected the correct areas for the webcam
2011-03-07T04:00:00.000Z	needlez	Guest68553	not sure, I don't use amsn or have it anymore, I use pidgin
2011-03-07T04:07:00.000Z	needlez	Guest68553	then you can't use aMsn to video chat, not sure what else is out there that supports  msn video chat, check either kopete, pidgin, or maybe they finally got something good in empathy??
2011-03-07T04:08:00.000Z	needlez	Guest68553	it won't work in pidgin, i just checked, still not working yet
2011-03-07T04:09:00.000Z	needlez	Guest68553	and as for kopete and empathy not sure, since Im not using them
