2009-09-26T08:17:00.000Z	XimDev		hello everybody
2009-09-26T08:17:00.000Z	XimDev		i messed things up
2009-09-26T08:17:00.000Z	XimDev		i moved /bin and now I can't launch the terminal
2009-09-26T08:17:00.000Z	XimDev		how do I move back from nautilus?
2009-09-26T08:17:00.000Z	prince_jammys	XimDev	do you have physical access to the computer?
2009-09-26T08:18:00.000Z	prince_jammys	XimDev	boot with a live CD, mount the filesystem and move it back.
2009-09-26T08:18:00.000Z	prince_jammys	XimDev	maybe. painfully, probably. It'll probably take longer to figure out than doing the above.
2009-09-26T08:27:00.000Z	prince_jammys	XimDev	... which is going to spawn /bin/bash, which you moved.
2009-09-26T08:31:00.000Z	prince_jammys	XimDev	where did you move it? what is the new path?
2009-09-26T08:32:00.000Z	XimDev	prince_jammys	i moved to /usr/local/build1/bin
2009-09-26T08:32:00.000Z	prince_jammys	XimDev	see if you can alt-f2  and  xterm -e /usr/local/build1/bin/bash
2009-09-26T08:33:00.000Z	prince_jammys	XimDev	or:  /usr/bin/xterm -e /usr/local/build1/bin/bash
2009-09-26T08:34:00.000Z	prince_jammys	XimDev	alt+f2 probably tries to spawn a shell, and doesn't find it.
2009-09-26T08:34:00.000Z	prince_jammys	XimDev	you have no open terminals anywhere, correct?
2009-09-26T08:35:00.000Z	prince_jammys	XimDev	by the time we figure out some hack (if we ever do), you could just reboot and take care of this.
2009-09-26T08:36:00.000Z	prince_jammys	XimDev	right. create a mountpoint: mkdir workspace , then mount the device to workspace and move workspace/usr/local/build1/bin to /workspace/bin
2009-09-26T08:37:00.000Z	prince_jammys	XimDev	mkdir /workspace, rather.
2009-09-26T08:38:00.000Z	prince_jammys	XimDev	use sudo fdisk -l to see the device name ('/dev/whatever')
2009-09-26T08:40:00.000Z	prince_jammys	XimDev	fdisk -l will report it, once you have a shell from the boot cd.
2009-09-26T09:20:00.000Z	XimDev	prince_jammys	I should have listened and did the mount first thing
2009-09-26T09:20:00.000Z	prince_jammys	XimDev	worked?
