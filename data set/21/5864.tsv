2007-07-21T13:22:00.000Z	metbsd		ext3 has 4G file size limit?
2007-07-21T13:24:00.000Z	metbsd		what do you mean "run set of dns servers"?
2007-07-21T13:24:00.000Z	metbsd		do you know what' dns is for?
2007-07-21T13:25:00.000Z	Kawika	metbsd	I specify different DNS server information than what the ISP provides, because it updates more frequently.
2007-07-21T13:29:00.000Z	Kawika	metbsd	the biggest issue I noticed is the updates, like when you change server information
2007-07-21T13:29:00.000Z	metbsd	Kawika	change server information? what server? what information?
2007-07-21T13:30:00.000Z	Kawika	metbsd	I have a few clients that run their own mail servers.  In setting up the DNS info, the local ISP took from several hours to 24 hours.
2007-07-21T13:31:00.000Z	Kawika	metbsd	I found a "free" DNS provider (I guess you would call it), that reflects updates in under 20 minutes
2007-07-21T13:32:00.000Z	Kawika	metbsd	yes, they have a domain that is hosted somewhere else, which makes the config that much more tricky.
2007-07-21T13:33:00.000Z	Kawika	metbsd	yup, we went through that whole fun process of mail server is "here" and web site is "there".
2007-07-21T13:34:00.000Z	metbsd	Kawika	what's the domain
2007-07-21T13:35:00.000Z	Kawika	metbsd	it's setup and running now for almost 2 years.  Running great.  New to xchat so not sure how to send privately
2007-07-21T13:35:00.000Z	metbsd	Kawika	domain need to be hosted on the root dns at least
2007-07-21T13:36:00.000Z	Kawika	metbsd	yes, with Godaddy, I have setup the www to point to the hosting, and mail.abc.com to the IP of the office.
2007-07-21T13:36:00.000Z	Kawika	metbsd	where the mail server resides.
2007-07-21T13:37:00.000Z	metbsd	Kawika	so what's the problem
2007-07-21T13:38:00.000Z	Kawika	metbsd	even went as far as having the ISP fix the reverse DNS lookup to respond mail.abc.com.
2007-07-21T13:38:00.000Z	Kawika	metbsd	sorry, there is no problem.  I even forget how we got on this... hehe
2007-07-21T13:39:00.000Z	Kawika	metbsd	yes, it's a good tool to use for spam prevention
2007-07-21T14:12:00.000Z	Kawika	metbsd	I did just the opposite the other day
2007-07-21T14:14:00.000Z	Kawika	metbsd	I have a dedicated machine I run Xp on for PS and Illustrator.
