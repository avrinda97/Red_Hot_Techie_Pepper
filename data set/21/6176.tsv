2007-08-16T16:31:00.000Z	Beyond_The_Grave		OK, here'smy problem I have an SD Card, it was working fine minutes ago... now, it decided that it wouldn't automount it, tried gparting it to a fat32 and it said "set partitiontype" tried using the command unmount which doesn't seem to exist on my system... and now I have an SD Card that I can't use... What do I do?
2007-08-16T16:32:00.000Z	Beyond_The_Grave		Does anybody know how to reformat a stubborn, unformatted disk?
2007-08-16T16:33:00.000Z	Beyond_The_Grave		I tried gparting it, but it keeps coming up with the error "set partitiontype"...
2007-08-16T16:34:00.000Z	Beyond_The_Grave		OK...
2007-08-16T16:34:00.000Z	Beyond_The_Grave		It also won't let me delete the old partition which is unknown.
2007-08-16T16:36:00.000Z	Beyond_The_Grave		It won't let me creat a new partition and it won't let me delete the old one.
2007-08-16T16:37:00.000Z	Beyond_The_Grave		OK, this sucks.... I can't even get gparted to delete a partition...
2007-08-16T16:38:00.000Z	Beyond_The_Grave		It sees it, but it won't let me do anything to it.
2007-08-16T16:39:00.000Z	Beyond_The_Grave		No, just want it to be a fat32 storage device.
2007-08-16T16:39:00.000Z	PF|Ubuntu	Beyond_The_Grave	are you using gparted?
2007-08-16T16:39:00.000Z	PF|Ubuntu	Beyond_The_Grave	what kind of drive? USB? IDE?
2007-08-16T16:40:00.000Z	PF|Ubuntu	Beyond_The_Grave	what does it show up as in /dev ??
2007-08-16T16:40:00.000Z	PF|Ubuntu	Beyond_The_Grave	gparted should take care of it. Did you umount it?
2007-08-16T16:41:00.000Z	PF|Ubuntu	Beyond_The_Grave	sudo umount /media/cardname
2007-08-16T16:41:00.000Z	PF|Ubuntu	Beyond_The_Grave	cardname is whatever the name of the disk is in /media
2007-08-16T16:42:00.000Z	PF|Ubuntu	Beyond_The_Grave	it's not in /media?
2007-08-16T16:42:00.000Z	PF|Ubuntu	Beyond_The_Grave	yeah
2007-08-16T16:43:00.000Z	PF|Ubuntu	Beyond_The_Grave	it's Umount, not UNmount
2007-08-16T16:43:00.000Z	PF|Ubuntu	Beyond_The_Grave	it shouldnt automount, as it's not a USB device
2007-08-16T16:44:00.000Z	PF|Ubuntu	Beyond_The_Grave	only USB devices automoutn when hotplugged
2007-08-16T16:45:00.000Z	PF|Ubuntu	Beyond_The_Grave	did you change any options pertaining to hotplugging?
