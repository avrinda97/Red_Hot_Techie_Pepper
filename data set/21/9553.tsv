2005-09-09T06:46:00.000Z	zeus1_		Umm ok everyone, my USB keyboard works fine, but my headset (plantronics dsp-500 USB headset) is not being detected on ubuntu. They work fine in Windows XP. Also my speakers are working (playing sound) perfectly fine, so the sound is working. Could anyone assist me in fixing this problem?

2005-09-09T06:48:00.000Z	pauldaoust	zeus1_	have you watched for the appearance and disappearance of any new items in the Device Manager when you plug and unplug the headset?
2005-09-09T06:48:00.000Z	pauldaoust	zeus1_	(Ubuntu device manager, not Windows)
2005-09-09T06:49:00.000Z	pauldaoust	zeus1_	hm. okay, let's see the output of lsusb instead
2005-09-09T06:49:00.000Z	zeus1_	pauldaoust	check the flood channel
2005-09-09T06:49:00.000Z	pauldaoust	zeus1_	hm, that's it?
2005-09-09T06:49:00.000Z	pauldaoust	zeus1_	and it can't be loose wires...
2005-09-09T06:51:00.000Z	pauldaoust	zeus1_	try typing dmesg and then paste the last ten or fifteen lines into #flood
2005-09-09T06:52:00.000Z	zeus1_	pauldaoust	check #flood channel
2005-09-09T06:54:00.000Z	pauldaoust	zeus1_	well, it does say "registered new driver snd-usb-audio" which is a good sign. maybe you just aren't choosing the proper soundcard to output to, in the program that you're using?
2005-09-09T06:55:00.000Z	pauldaoust	zeus1_	(not sure how to do that, as I only have one sound card, and it's been a while since I've had two, so everything's changed)
2005-09-09T06:56:00.000Z	pauldaoust	zeus1_	bizarre. I'm not sure...
2005-09-09T06:56:00.000Z	pauldaoust	zeus1_	one last thing to paste: could you paste the output of lsmod into #flood?
2005-09-09T06:59:00.000Z	zeus1_	pauldaoust	ok i posted in flood
2005-09-09T07:01:00.000Z	pauldaoust	zeus1_	gee whiz
2005-09-09T07:01:00.000Z	pauldaoust	zeus1_	I can't see anything wrong
2005-09-09T07:01:00.000Z	pauldaoust	zeus1_	looks okay to me
2005-09-09T07:14:00.000Z	zeus1_	pauldaoust	its still not playing in the headset yet
2005-09-09T07:17:00.000Z	zeus1_	pauldaoust	u there
