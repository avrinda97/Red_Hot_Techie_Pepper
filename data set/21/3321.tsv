2009-01-27T06:41:00.000Z	DoctaEntropy		 I tried to mount my external hard drive, and have had some difficulties. It's a western digital 500GB that I formatted to NTFS not too long ago and pretty much all it has is a lot of media files. I just installed a dual boot with ubuntu, and wanted to mount it.

2009-01-27T06:41:00.000Z	BCampbell	DoctaEntropy	have you tried ntfs-config?
2009-01-27T06:43:00.000Z	DoctaEntropy	BCampbell	I am literally a little baby and have no experience with Ubuntu beyond 24 hours ago. I have no clue what ntfs-config is, or how I should go about doing it.
2009-01-27T06:44:00.000Z	BCampbell	DoctaEntropy	welcome to the club... in a terminal type (without quotes) "sudo apt-get install ntfs-config"
2009-01-27T06:44:00.000Z	DoctaEntropy	BCampbell	finished I think
2009-01-27T06:45:00.000Z	BCampbell	DoctaEntropy	look in the "applications menu" at the top of the screen, you should have a system tools item, in there you can configure read/write to external drives
2009-01-27T06:47:00.000Z	DoctaEntropy	BCampbell	now what
2009-01-27T06:47:00.000Z	BCampbell	DoctaEntropy	you may have to close the x-server (ctrl+alt+bkspace) and log back in..that's all it took for my external drive to work
2009-01-27T06:53:00.000Z	DoctaEntropy	BCampbell	no luck
2009-01-27T06:54:00.000Z	DoctaEntropy	BCampbell	still won't mount. and i tried to force it again, but it didn't work then either
2009-01-27T06:54:00.000Z	BCampbell	DoctaEntropy	I may have missed a step, did you try to add the mount to your fstab?  if so remove the entries and reboot.  Sorry my bad
2009-01-27T07:37:00.000Z	DoctaEntropy	BCampbell	no
2009-01-27T07:37:00.000Z	DoctaEntropy	BCampbell	sorry for the wait, no luck

2009-01-27T07:37:00.000Z	BCampbell	DoctaEntropy	man... is it listed in NTFS-Config tool?
2009-01-27T07:41:00.000Z	BCampbell	DoctaEntropy	just to refresh..you removed the entiry from fstab and rebooted, when you open the NTFS-Config tool is the extrenal drive there and can you click on the "allow write to external" option?
