2010-05-01T11:09:00.000Z	zetheroo		can someone explain to me how from one release to the next things break? - Is this the universal model for Linux distros, that with every new release you are back to square one and it's a toss-up whether or not what worked previously will work now?
2010-05-01T11:11:00.000Z	arand	zetheroo	Regressions always happen, all boils down to how long you take to fix them, a rolling releas gives it no time, ubuntu gives it some time, debian stable gives it ages...
2010-05-01T11:13:00.000Z	arand	zetheroo	Also, if that is the case, you should participate in  prerelease testing, report bugs and make sure it's all fixed by the release ;)
2010-05-01T11:13:00.000Z	zetheroo	arand	so is it a matter of the Ubuntu team (for example) changing/updating/replacing packages and thinking "oh well, this will probably f**k things up for some people.... but heck ... "?
2010-05-01T11:14:00.000Z	zetheroo	arand	this particular issue was sounded off before the official release ... I don't think it really makes a difference
2010-05-01T11:14:00.000Z	arand	zetheroo	It's either that or not upgrade anything at all, they can't possibly test everything.
2010-05-01T11:15:00.000Z	zetheroo	arand	not 'everything' but is there no quality control that says "make sure that what was working previously is still going to work"? - obviously not ...
2010-05-01T11:16:00.000Z	arand	zetheroo	We as the community are supposed to provide that quality control ;)
2010-05-01T11:19:00.000Z	zetheroo	arand	I guess what I am realising in the Linux world (and Open Source) is that we the users are the testers ... and there will probably never be a consistently functioning and dependable release ... it will always be "beta" or "testing" even after official release ...
2010-05-01T11:22:00.000Z	arand	zetheroo	That all depends on how much time is allocated for the testing. The more time, the more stabe... Ubuntu is very quick in releases in my opinion at least..
2010-05-01T11:23:00.000Z	zetheroo	arand	right ... so it's more or less that really to get a "better" Ubuntu experience you would upgrade maybe 3 months after the official release date
2010-05-01T11:26:00.000Z	arand	zetheroo	Yea, and stick to LTS...
2010-05-01T11:26:00.000Z	zetheroo	arand	well God forbid I would still be using 8.04 ... :P
2010-05-01T11:27:00.000Z	arand	zetheroo	See, that's why, you want the latest, hence you will also get the latest bugs that comes with it...
2010-05-01T11:29:00.000Z	zetheroo	arand	well this is the thing right .. Ubuntu is released and people want to have the latest ... but if it's not fully tested why is it being released as a "stable" release?
2010-05-01T11:29:00.000Z	zetheroo	arand	it should be released every 6 months as a "testing" release and then every year there should be a "stable" release - That would be honest!
2010-05-01T11:31:00.000Z	arand	zetheroo	Well feel free to convince the techincal board ;)
2010-05-01T11:34:00.000Z	zetheroo	arand	I know - ha
2012-02-29T04:14:00.000Z	arand	zetheroo	try testdisk
2012-02-29T04:15:00.000Z	zetheroo	arand	could you expound a little?
