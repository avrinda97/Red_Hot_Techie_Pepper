2007-10-30T14:42:00.000Z	grazie		I believe my BIOS supports booting from from an external USB device. However I cannot get it to work. It's a Pheonix AwardBIOS. Any suggestions?
2007-10-30T14:42:00.000Z	inversekinetix	grazie	go into your bios and make sure that boot from USB is enabled and add USB device to the boot sequence
2007-10-30T14:44:00.000Z	grazie	inversekinetix	I don't have that. All that is available is Removable in Advanced Settings boot sequence
2007-10-30T14:44:00.000Z	inversekinetix	grazie	put the removable 1st in the list
2007-10-30T14:45:00.000Z	grazie	inversekinetix	it is - at the top!
2007-10-30T14:46:00.000Z	inversekinetix	grazie	strange, i cant help you in anymore detail, but i remember reading somewhere recently that if the sector??  size is wrong you cant use it as a boot device
2007-10-30T14:48:00.000Z	grazie	inversekinetix	sector size of the bootable media? How do I set that for CD images and USB pendrives?
2007-10-30T14:48:00.000Z	inversekinetix	grazie	is it a HD or flash memory?
2007-10-30T14:49:00.000Z	grazie	inversekinetix	tried usb flash pendrive and cd image on external usb cd-rom (just to test)
2007-10-30T14:50:00.000Z	inversekinetix	grazie	what OS are you trying to boot
2007-10-30T14:50:00.000Z	grazie	inversekinetix	gutsy
2007-10-30T14:51:00.000Z	inversekinetix	grazie	 http://www.pendrivelinux.com/2007/09/28/usb-ubuntu-710-gutsy-gibbon-install/
2007-10-30T14:51:00.000Z	grazie	inversekinetix	followed that
2007-10-30T14:52:00.000Z	grazie	inversekinetix	problem appears to be with BIOS if I can't boot from cd-rom
2007-10-30T14:53:00.000Z	inversekinetix		you cant boot with optical media either?
2007-10-30T14:53:00.000Z	grazie	inversekinetix	exactly
2007-10-30T14:54:00.000Z	inversekinetix	grazie	can you update you bios? or reflash it?
2007-10-30T14:55:00.000Z	grazie	inversekinetix	it's a brand new machine....I can look for an update but I doubt it'll fix this
2007-10-30T14:57:00.000Z	inversekinetix	grazie	i wish i could help you more but if your bios settings are correct and you followed the instructions in the guide I dont really know what else to suggest
2007-10-30T14:58:00.000Z	inversekinetix		can anyone tell me how to enable search for my root directory?
2007-10-30T14:58:00.000Z	grazie	inversekinetix	thanks...I'm stumped too
