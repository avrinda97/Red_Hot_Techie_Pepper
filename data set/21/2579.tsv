2009-08-29T11:49:00.000Z	Parsley		Can anyone help with installing Ubuntu from one partition to another on the same HDD?
2009-08-29T11:50:00.000Z	Parsley		how
2009-08-29T11:50:00.000Z	Parsley		ive never used the dd
2009-08-29T11:52:00.000Z	aj_444	Parsley	what do you mean you've placed the LiveCD in one?
2009-08-29T11:53:00.000Z	Parsley	aj_444	I extracted the LiveCD contents as well as SuperGrub to one partition via Unetbootin
2009-08-29T11:53:00.000Z	Parsley	aj_444	and it boots
2009-08-29T11:53:00.000Z	aj_444	Parsley	So you installed it?
2009-08-29T12:02:00.000Z	aj_444	Parsley	Burn to a CD then.
2009-08-29T12:02:00.000Z	Parsley	aj_444	i dont have an external CD drive
2009-08-29T12:03:00.000Z	aj_444	Parsley	You can order one for like $5.
2009-08-29T12:03:00.000Z	aj_444	Parsley	What kind of computer do you have?
2009-08-29T12:03:00.000Z	Parsley	aj_444	toshiba m200 portege, a real beast to reinstall
2009-08-29T12:04:00.000Z	Parsley	aj_444	this model only boots for very particular and expensive cdroms
2009-08-29T12:04:00.000Z	aj_444	Parsley	you have a picky cd drive? Thats a new one. xD
2009-08-29T12:04:00.000Z	aj_444	Parsley	Were you able to get ubuntu running as a live image?
2009-08-29T12:05:00.000Z	Parsley	aj_444	when placed on (hd0,2) yes it runs just fine
2009-08-29T12:05:00.000Z	aj_444	Parsley	Do you not want to install there?
2009-08-29T12:05:00.000Z	Parsley	aj_444	but when installing onto (hd0,0), it seems to think (hd0,2) is /cdrom, thus interfering with assigning the mounting point /
2009-08-29T12:06:00.000Z	aj_444	Parsley	:S I'm not really an expert on this. I'd suggest coming back during the day. Thats where I've found there are more people to help.
2009-08-29T12:06:00.000Z	Parsley	aj_444	summary: liveCD on partition A, want to actually install full OS on partition B, refuses to do so
2009-08-31T10:00:00.000Z	Parsley	aj_444	system, pref, appearance
