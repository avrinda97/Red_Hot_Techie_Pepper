2007-05-10T16:33:00.000Z	daedra	wiitard	I recommend, before using network-manager, to look under ubuntuforums.org for your card name
2007-05-10T16:33:00.000Z	daedra	wiitard	what is your chipset for your wireless card?
2007-05-10T16:33:00.000Z	wiitard	daedra	INTEL PRO BG

2007-05-10T16:34:00.000Z	daedra	wiitard	no "app". just use console, using any help you get from ubuntuforums.org
