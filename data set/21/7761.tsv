2006-07-23T14:35:00.000Z	livingdaylight		i need help with an annoyance. Watching dvd(orwhatever) the screensaver kicks in. How do i stop that?
2006-07-23T14:36:00.000Z	livingdaylight		hello?
2006-07-23T14:37:00.000Z	livingdaylight		surely, this is a simple problem to solve?
2006-07-23T14:37:00.000Z	trippp1	livingdaylight	turn off the screensaver
2006-07-23T14:38:00.000Z	livingdaylight	trippp1	just untick the 'activate screensaver' box?
2006-07-23T14:40:00.000Z	livingdaylight	trippp1	hello?
2006-07-23T14:40:00.000Z	trippp1	livingdaylight	yes. in the screensaver settings
2006-07-23T14:40:00.000Z	livingdaylight	trippp1	what happens if i switch it off?
2006-07-23T14:40:00.000Z	livingdaylight	trippp1	what happens then if the system is idle?
2006-07-23T14:40:00.000Z	trippp1	livingdaylight	dont leave you PC on.
2006-07-23T14:41:00.000Z	livingdaylight	trippp1	so, if i'm watching dvd, say, the system power wont go idle?
2006-07-23T14:41:00.000Z	livingdaylight	trippp1	what do you mean don't leave your pc on?
2006-07-23T14:43:00.000Z	livingdaylight	trippp1	man.....
2006-07-23T14:43:00.000Z	trippp1	livingdaylight	screensaver to save screen if an image is on it for too long. if you turn it off your screen may burn. if it is LCD. no matter!
2006-07-23T14:47:00.000Z	livingdaylight	trippp1	what is annoying is when i'm using the pc and the screensaver comes on regardsless. If i'm watching a dvd the pc is being used, why does the system not recognise that i'm watching a dvd and not unleash the screensaver?
2006-07-23T14:48:00.000Z	trippp1	livingdaylight	system > preferences > screeensaver  un tick the box.
2006-07-23T14:49:00.000Z	livingdaylight	trippp1	i know how to do that. But it doesn't answer my question
2006-07-23T14:50:00.000Z	trippp1	livingdaylight	i hate the screensaver.. you cant pick the DIR it gets the slideshow from
2006-07-23T14:50:00.000Z	livingdaylight	trippp1	i inderstand. How is power managed if i untick screensaver?
2006-07-23T14:51:00.000Z	livingdaylight	trippp1	will the pc just switch off whilst in the middle of watching a dvd, or movie clip?
2006-07-23T14:51:00.000Z	livingdaylight	trippp1	do you understand the question?
