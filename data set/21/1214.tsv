2011-03-23T17:16:00.000Z	Ja23		I am working on expanding two partitions and shrinking a third, I can't seem to expand my Windows partition, does anyone know why?
2011-03-23T17:17:00.000Z	Ja23		The linux one worked fine, but the windows one doesn't give me the option
2011-03-23T17:18:00.000Z	Ja23		Gparted!
2011-03-23T17:18:00.000Z	Ja23		=)
2011-03-23T17:19:00.000Z	Ja23		Yeahhh
2011-03-23T17:19:00.000Z	Ja23		The unallocated space is at the beginning of /dev/sda3
2011-03-23T17:20:00.000Z	Ja23		the one i want to expand is /dev/sda2
2011-03-23T17:20:00.000Z	Ja23		ohh, hm, how do i check?
2011-03-23T17:20:00.000Z	Ja23		I'm running a live CD btw
2011-03-23T17:21:00.000Z	Ja23		Yes, sda3 does
2011-03-23T17:22:00.000Z	zvacet	Ja23	and sda2?
2011-03-23T17:22:00.000Z	zvacet	Ja23	 strange you should be able to resize it
2011-03-23T17:23:00.000Z	zvacet	Ja23	 it means it is loked (mounted I think)
2011-03-23T17:24:00.000Z	Ja23	zvacet	want me to upload a picture for you?
2011-03-23T17:25:00.000Z	zvacet	Ja23	 ok but not expect too much from me  :)

2011-03-23T17:31:00.000Z	zvacet	Ja23	do you run gparted from live cd?
2011-03-23T17:32:00.000Z	zvacet	Ja23	 try to shrink sda3 because it is extended partition and your unallocated space is inside of it
2011-03-23T17:33:00.000Z	zvacet	Ja23	shrink from left to right to get unallocated space outside of sda3
2011-03-23T17:36:00.000Z	Ja23	zvacet	thanks for trying to help, my gf wants me to watch the movie with her, I'll be back later!
2011-03-23T17:38:00.000Z	zvacet	Ja23	 it is smart decision  8-)
