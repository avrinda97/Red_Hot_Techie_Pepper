2005-07-25T10:42:00.000Z	desrt		derekgiles; yes.  if you install ubuntu on a computer that already has windows on it, that's exactly what it will do
2005-07-25T10:42:00.000Z	desrt		kick who?
2005-07-25T10:42:00.000Z	desrt		derekgiles; i hope things work out well for you :)
2005-07-25T10:42:00.000Z	desrt		:)
2005-07-25T10:43:00.000Z	desrt		well.  i hope i never see you again, then :)
2005-07-25T10:44:00.000Z	desrt		derekgiles; k :)
2005-07-25T10:46:00.000Z	desrt		firebird619; f-spot is in apt... you should just be able to apt-get it
2005-07-25T10:47:00.000Z	desrt		oh.  i see.
2005-07-25T10:47:00.000Z	desrt		firebird619; try running the synaptic f-spot from the terminal
2005-07-25T10:47:00.000Z	desrt		firebird619; see if it says anything like error messages
2005-07-25T10:47:00.000Z	firebird619	desrt	Isn't that sort of the same thing as getting it through Synaptic. Will apt-get also download all these dependencies that I need?
2005-07-25T10:48:00.000Z	firebird619	desrt	Sorry for the long message. When I tried getting it through Synaptic I didn't get any errors.
2005-07-25T10:49:00.000Z	firebird619	desrt	How can I get the one install from Synaptic working. It needs those libraries and all I find them for is gentoo. Will alien convert them to .deb files?
2005-07-25T10:50:00.000Z	firebird619	desrt	right.
2005-07-25T10:51:00.000Z	firebird619	desrt	OK I will try reinstalling it. I am on dial-up Internet so it will take a few minutes.
2005-07-25T10:54:00.000Z	firebird619	desrt	It is done downloading and installing.
2005-07-25T11:00:00.000Z	firebird619	desrt	It says:
2005-07-25T11:01:00.000Z	firebird619	desrt	no, it is not installed. I am assuming I need to install it
2005-07-25T11:03:00.000Z	firebird619	desrt	I have a backport repository but it never seems to work. Should I delete it?
2005-07-25T11:05:00.000Z	firebird619	desrt	Yes, it makes sense to delete it beings it doesn't work but I thought it maybe would start working again. Those files are downloading. I will let you know when they are done installing and I will see if it works.
2005-07-25T11:13:00.000Z	firebird619	desrt	That solved   the problem. Thanks for the help.
