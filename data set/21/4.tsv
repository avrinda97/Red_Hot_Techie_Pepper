2004-11-06T11:49:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		it didn't complain in the least.
2004-11-06T11:49:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		it recommended it
2004-11-06T11:49:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		but it didn't depend on it.
2004-11-06T11:50:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		and it didn't automatically depned on it.
2004-11-06T11:50:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		I had xlibs
2004-11-06T11:50:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		but it didn't complain about not having x-window-server or whatever it was.
2004-11-06T11:51:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		and when i ran /etc/init.d/gdm start, it said it could'nt find /usr/X11R6/bin/X
2004-11-06T11:51:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		so I installed x-windows-server or something like that and it suddenly worked; though it took me about an hour poking around.
2004-11-06T11:52:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		because gnome is an X program that needs to run under an X server
2004-11-06T11:53:00.000Z	lifeless	bluefoxicy	actually, gnome is a xclient program, not an xserver program. (I've used it happily like that, gnome on my server,windows on my desktop with a local XServer.)
2004-11-06T11:54:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	lifeless	 ah, so an xserver is not required?
2004-11-06T11:54:00.000Z	lifeless		not on the same machine, no.
2004-11-06T11:54:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	lifeless	 it also seems to not depend on metacity (window manager), nautilus (to draw the icons/desktop), and gnome-panel (for menus and task bar)
2004-11-06T11:55:00.000Z	lifeless		those, I can't comment on. there is a gnome-desktop though, that IIRC brings in everything.
2004-11-06T11:55:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		which pretty much means it dumps you to a blue screen where mouseclicksa nd keycombos do nothing.
2004-11-06T11:55:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		ah!
2004-11-06T11:55:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		gnome-desktop
2004-11-06T11:55:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		what of thunderbird?
2004-11-06T11:55:00.000Z	bluefoxicy		I have ~/.thunderbird/ on gentoo, share my home directory, but thunderbird on ubuntu thinks there's nothing
2004-11-06T11:55:00.000Z	lifeless	bluefoxicy	no idea sorry.
