2006-03-26T10:37:00.000Z	SilentJihad		I tried to install MPlayer but I got this message that says :: i'm not useing a good C compiler and gives me a Bad GCC Version Error
2006-03-26T10:37:00.000Z	SilentJihad		Any ideas?
2006-03-26T10:37:00.000Z	_jason	SilentJihad	mplayer is in the repositories
2006-03-26T13:13:00.000Z	_jason	SilentJihad	use synaptic
2006-03-26T13:42:00.000Z	_jason	SilentJihad	did you 'sudo apt-get build-dep mplayer-386'
2006-03-26T13:42:00.000Z	_jason	SilentJihad	that command installs the dependencies you need to build the repo version (which are usually what you need to build the newer source too)
2006-03-28T09:46:00.000Z	_jason	SilentJihad	put the error on pastebin
2006-03-28T09:50:00.000Z	SilentJihad	_jason	:: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/10686
2006-03-28T09:50:00.000Z	_jason	SilentJihad	did you install from the repositories?
2006-03-28T09:50:00.000Z	_jason	SilentJihad	how?
2006-03-28T09:51:00.000Z	_jason	SilentJihad	the one in the repositories works fine.  Don't know about that error
2006-03-28T09:51:00.000Z	_jason	SilentJihad	you can try #mplayer if you want to keep what you compiled
2006-03-28T09:52:00.000Z	SilentJihad	_jason	:: well its not really important I was just trying to practice compileing from source
2006-03-28T10:44:00.000Z	_jason	SilentJihad	what happened when you tried the line of code in console?
2006-03-28T10:45:00.000Z	SilentJihad	_jason	it says... bash: cd: wget: No such file or directory
2006-03-28T10:45:00.000Z	_jason	SilentJihad	paste exactly what you entered
2006-03-28T10:51:00.000Z	_jason	SilentJihad	stilll alive?
