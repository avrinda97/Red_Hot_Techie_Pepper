2005-10-31T09:49:00.000Z	RabidDog		k lemme now ask this question again with bob2 on my ignore list
2005-10-31T09:49:00.000Z	RabidDog		Question: I have a machine that uses the EMT64 rather then the AMD64 cpu, would all I need to do to make it properly compatible with EMT64 is upgrade it to the EMT64 Kernel after installing it, The system is a EMT64 Intel 830 Dual Core Processor?
2005-10-31T09:50:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	RabidDog	yeah, pointless
2005-10-31T09:50:00.000Z	RabidDog	HrdwrBoB	what is pointless?
2005-10-31T09:50:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	RabidDog	EM64T
2005-10-31T09:50:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	RabidDog	install the i386 version
2005-10-31T09:51:00.000Z	RabidDog	HrdwrBoB	it's a dual proc
2005-10-31T09:51:00.000Z	RabidDog	HrdwrBoB	so install 386 SMT?
2005-10-31T09:52:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	RabidDog	SMP, yes
2005-10-31T09:52:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	RabidDog	but the kernel is jsut installed afterwards
2005-10-31T09:53:00.000Z	RabidDog	HrdwrBoB	I just want to take advantage of the dual core is all I'm looking to do :)
2005-10-31T09:53:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	RabidDog	then just use an SMP i686 kernel on a standard i386 breezy install
2005-10-31T09:53:00.000Z	RabidDog	HrdwrBoB	well EMT64 is just a renamed amd64 with a couple extra extensions?
2005-10-31T09:54:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	RabidDog	no, em64t is a completely pointless implementation of amd64 for compatibility only
2005-10-31T09:55:00.000Z	RabidDog	HrdwrBoB	alrigh I'll take your word on that
2005-10-31T09:56:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	RabidDog	it's a better design
2005-10-31T09:58:00.000Z	RabidDog	HrdwrBoB	Just to clairfy,if I were to install amd64 it would run slower then the 386, right?
2005-10-31T09:58:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	RabidDog	correct
2005-10-31T10:00:00.000Z	RabidDog	HrdwrBoB	so even changing the kernel to the EMT64 kernel would not make a difference?
2005-10-31T10:02:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	RabidDog	em64t is pointless crap
2005-10-31T10:02:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	RabidDog	end of story
