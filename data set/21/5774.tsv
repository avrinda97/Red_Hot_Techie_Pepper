2008-04-05T10:27:00.000Z	morris		Yep.
2008-04-05T10:28:00.000Z	nikrud	morris	do  grep morris /etc/passwd,  and   grep morris /etc/groups  please, let me see those
2008-04-05T10:28:00.000Z	nikrud	morris	erm, that's /etc/group that is
2008-04-05T10:29:00.000Z	morris	nikrud	morris:x:1000:1000:Morris,,,:/home/morris:/bin/bash
2008-04-05T10:29:00.000Z	nikrud	morris	and   groups
2008-04-05T10:29:00.000Z	morris	nikrud	- 1 mo
2008-04-05T10:30:00.000Z	nikrud	morris	erm, that's a 3rd one,   groups  shows all the groups you're a member of ;)
2008-04-05T10:30:00.000Z	morris		nikrud:
2008-04-05T10:30:00.000Z	morris		morris:x:1000:
2008-04-05T10:30:00.000Z	morris		vboxusers:x:127:morris
2008-04-05T10:31:00.000Z	morris		Yep - I know what I did - and I know that editing the groups file manually will probably fix it, but I have only been using Linux for a week...
2008-04-05T10:31:00.000Z	nikrud	morris	ok, you got a problem, you're not in the admin group.    reboot into recovery mode, and run adduser morris admin . That gives back sudo
2008-04-05T10:31:00.000Z	nikrud	morris	or if you have root , run it there
2008-04-05T10:32:00.000Z	morris	nikrud	thanks - I didn't think of using recovery mode!
2008-04-05T10:32:00.000Z	nikrud	morris	and you'll need to add back some other groups as well. I'm not in gutsy at the moment so I can't give you the list, but some kind soul here should be able to give you the output of   groups
2008-04-05T10:33:00.000Z	morris		I will just use whatever groups are in the admin mode.
2008-04-05T10:33:00.000Z	morris		I just need to remember not to use -g option  with adduser :)
2008-04-05T10:33:00.000Z	nikrud	morris	there's several, such as plugdev and audio and some others you need to be a member of.
2008-04-05T10:33:00.000Z	nikrud		hehe
2008-04-05T10:33:00.000Z	morris	nikrud	thanks heaps.
