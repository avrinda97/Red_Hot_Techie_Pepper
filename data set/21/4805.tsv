2008-02-10T11:49:00.000Z	cptnapalm	Dr_willis	what were they thinking slapping it into /usr/share/doc....
2008-02-10T11:50:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cptnapalm	 its an example config file. :)  where else should it be.
2008-02-10T11:51:00.000Z	cptnapalm	Dr_willis	I've always hated example configs... I mean, ship the damn thing with something that at least barely works and put it in the right place...  Where the hell is my pitchfork?!?!
2008-02-10T11:52:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cptnapalm	i found it. :)   of course i also read the docs. :)
2008-02-10T11:54:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cptnapalm	 the fact its mentioned in the man page  is  hiding it eh. :)
2008-02-10T11:54:00.000Z	cptnapalm	Dr_willis	Everything should go where it is supposed to go...
2008-02-10T11:55:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cptnapalm	 it dosent need one  :) so there for its going in the example dir.
2008-02-10T11:56:00.000Z	cptnapalm	Dr_willis	but it has to be in the directory from which you happen to be to run the program?  that's sad... Hell even a totally incompetent n00Bz C learner can find out how to load from a default location...
2008-02-10T11:57:00.000Z	cptnapalm	Dr_willis	Ok maybe not one totally incompetent... I mean I don't know how to do it and I'm completely clueless heh
2008-02-10T11:58:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cptnapalm	 I WANT it to run from the current dir. that way when i cd to 'doom' and do 'dosbox' it auto runs that config file. which i set up to run doom., if i am in the warlords dir - i set it up to auto run warlords
2008-02-10T11:58:00.000Z	cptnapalm	Dr_willis	Oh wait... its not a system config then?  Its a per app thing?
2008-02-10T11:59:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cptnapalm	it looks for a user made config, and in the current dir..
2008-02-10T12:01:00.000Z	cptnapalm	Dr_willis	it would seem to me a better way to do that would be to have it as essentially a script which you would toss in a personal bin so just call up whatever game you want to run by its name
2008-02-10T12:01:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cptnapalm	 unless you need seperate configs for each game..
2008-02-10T12:02:00.000Z	cptnapalm	Dr_willis	nope.  See if was essentially a script, then you would change what options needed to be changed then name the script after the game.  Calling the script would then call dosbox to run the dos game in the specially needed way.
2008-02-10T12:03:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cptnapalm	 this is linxu do whatever you want. You could alwyas set up whatever alias;s ytou want. :P
2008-02-10T12:04:00.000Z	cptnapalm	Dr_willis	Of course I've now been talking out of my butt for half an hour about a program that I have never used so... Ignore me at your leisure :)
2008-02-10T12:04:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cptnapalm	  im about to. :) i 'cd warlords2' and run run dosbox. and it runs the game for me. I could make a 2 line script that just cd's and runs. if i wanted.
2008-02-10T12:05:00.000Z	cptnapalm	Dr_willis	I remember writing scripts like that... but no one ever said you had to be in the particular directory to run the stuff so I'd be stupidly looking into dependency problems for a week...
2008-02-10T12:07:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cptnapalm	 the man page for dosbox tells where it look for the config. :)   current dir, then a users .dosboxrc  or other ways.
