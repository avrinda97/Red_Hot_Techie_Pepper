2010-03-12T07:16:00.000Z	Losha	qayos	you can boot 9.10 from grub1 and 8.04 from grub2 if need be. Do you know what went wrong with your 8.04 install?
2010-03-12T07:16:00.000Z	qayos	Losha	- I'm not sure at what point it went bad, bit it said there were errors on the DVD.
2010-03-12T07:17:00.000Z	Losha	qayos	Do you have a good live install cd for 9.10?
2010-03-12T07:19:00.000Z	Losha	qayos	if you can boot the 8.04 livecd, you can do a grub restore. Let me find a link for you...
2010-03-12T07:19:00.000Z	qayos	Losha	I can burn one and come back when I have it if necessary.
2010-03-12T07:19:00.000Z	qayos	Losha	ok, i tried following one, and i got to the step that said to do a find, and i got an error, the instructions said nothing about what to do on error
2010-03-12T07:20:00.000Z	Losha	qayos	erm, if your 9.10 release uses ext4 (the default) you won't be able to see if from 8.04 and you'll need to do the grub restore using the 9.10 livecd...
2010-03-12T07:21:00.000Z	qayos	Losha	All my partitions are NTFS or Ext3 (or swap)
2010-03-12T07:22:00.000Z	Losha	qayos	ok, can you open a terminal and run 'sudo fdisk -l' (that's lower case L) and paste the output to http://ubuntu.pastebin.com
2010-03-12T07:23:00.000Z	qayos	Losha	http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/FyXUHRiV
2010-03-12T07:26:00.000Z	Losha	qayos	agreed, I see ntfs on /dev/sda1 (is that a windows install?) and ext3 on /dev/sda2, 5 and 6.
2010-03-12T07:27:00.000Z	qayos	Losha	yep... sda1 = WinXP... sda2=9.10 (/)... sda3=swap... sda5=(/home for both 9.10 and 8.04)... sda6=failed 8.04 (/) install
2010-03-12T07:27:00.000Z	Losha	qayos	because your 8.04 is in an unknown state, I think you'd better boot 9.10 and do a grub recovery from there....
2010-03-12T07:27:00.000Z	Losha	qayos	because there's no guarantee your 8.04 is bootable if the install went wrong...
2010-03-12T07:27:00.000Z	qayos	Losha	I don't need the 8.04 at all anymore, we can just delete it.
2010-03-12T07:28:00.000Z	Losha	qayos	just ignore it for now, nothing to be gained by going around deleting partitions at this point. You need to boot 9.10 live cd
2010-03-12T07:29:00.000Z	qayos	Losha	Don't currently have a 9.10 livecd, will burn one and come back (I have another computer).
2010-03-12T07:30:00.000Z	Losha	qayos	ok, in case I'm not here, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Grub2#Recover%20Grub%202%20via%20LiveCD
2010-03-12T07:30:00.000Z	qayos	Losha	ok, thanks :)
2010-03-12T07:30:00.000Z	Losha	qayos	best of luck :-)
2010-03-12T08:28:00.000Z	Losha	qayos	glad to hear it. You can install 9.04 over the failed 8.04 install by choosing manual partition during install. Best of luck...
