2009-01-29T22:35:00.000Z	BuckWild		hey, I installed updates on my laptop today and it installed new headers, when I went to reboot my computer it got stuck in a kernel panic
2009-01-29T22:35:00.000Z	BuckWild		anybody have any idea what was in the new linux headers or whatever
2009-01-29T22:36:00.000Z	BuckWild		the only way I could get my computer to start was to use grub to go back to the previous version
2009-01-29T22:36:00.000Z	sipior	BuckWild	what was the error? also, did it happen more than once?
2009-01-29T22:37:00.000Z	BuckWild	sipior	it happens everytime I start the computer, looks like something about paging and virtual memory
2009-01-29T22:37:00.000Z	sipior	BuckWild	what was the precise error?
2009-01-29T22:37:00.000Z	BuckWild	sipior	"unable to handle kernel paging request" was what the bulk of the messages were
2009-01-29T22:38:00.000Z	BuckWild	sipior	is there a way I can get those errors in one of the logs?
2009-01-29T22:39:00.000Z	sipior	BuckWild	check for older versions of /var/log/dmesg
2009-01-29T22:39:00.000Z	sipior	BuckWild	also, it installed a new kernel package along with the headers, right?
2009-01-29T22:40:00.000Z	BuckWild	sipior	believe so, I didn't really pay too much attention to what it was installing but I saw the linux kernel stuff in there and took note because I knew I'd have to recompile my wireless drivers to get them to work
2009-01-29T22:42:00.000Z	BuckWild	sipior	another interesting bit of trivia is that I was able to boot successfully into the new kernel mod when I used recovery mode
2009-01-29T22:43:00.000Z	sipior	BuckWild	do you specify any boot options for your kernels?
2009-01-29T22:43:00.000Z	BuckWild	sipior	so I'm not sure exactly what the difference is between recovery mode and normal boot, but when I booted into recovery mode and got the prompt I hit resume normal boot and it works
2009-01-29T22:43:00.000Z	BuckWild	sipior	should just be default stuff
2009-01-29T22:44:00.000Z	sipior	BuckWild	might be a bug in the package...i didn't manage to find a recent bug report discussing this for ubuntu 8.10.
2009-01-29T22:44:00.000Z	BuckWild	sipior	I probably should've mentioned, I'm on 8.04
2009-01-29T22:45:00.000Z	sipior	BuckWild	well, as long as you've got it working, might as well leave it in place, and see if another kernel package update isn't forthcoming shortly :-) or, consider an upgrade to 8.10?
2009-01-29T22:45:00.000Z	BuckWild	sipior	I guess I can do that, I tried upgrading to 8.10, but the network manager was....shall I say, not a great fit, and the wireless driver in 8.10 for my laptop left loads to be desired
2009-01-29T22:46:00.000Z	sipior	BuckWild	maybe best to leave well enough alone, in that case.
2009-01-29T22:46:00.000Z	BuckWild	sipior	yeah, I'm hoping that 9.04 will fix some problems that I have with 8.10, and it probably will
