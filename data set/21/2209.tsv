2010-01-07T11:54:00.000Z	NoCode		Is there anyway to get the old sound applet back prior to karmic? Currently using karmic, and my PA is MESSED up. I had to kill pulseaudio to make my sound work proper, it hasn't glitched so far. Though, the volumes are still a little messed up
2010-01-07T11:55:00.000Z	NoCode		Maybe I'll just try OpenSuse
2010-01-07T11:55:00.000Z	NoCode		and see how that applet is
2010-01-07T11:56:00.000Z	NoCode		It's a shame though. This release is a pisser. :(
2010-01-07T11:56:00.000Z	EastDallas	NoCode	Have you tried installing Pulse Alsa Mixer?  Gives more volume controls
2010-01-07T11:57:00.000Z	EastDallas	NoCode	sorry Gnome Alsa Mixer
2010-01-07T11:59:00.000Z	EastDallas	NoCode	Home that helps...It def. helped me.  Also, installing the Ubuntu Studio Audio package installs a bunch of great tools.
2010-01-07T11:59:00.000Z	EastDallas	NoCode	but also a bunch of stuff you may not need.
2010-01-07T11:59:00.000Z	NoCode	EastDallas	What command do I get the gnome alsamixer working?
2010-01-07T11:59:00.000Z	NoCode	EastDallas	Yeah, I'm not going to install ubuntu studio packages
2010-01-07T12:00:00.000Z	EastDallas	NoCode	it's under Applications>Sound and Video
2010-01-07T12:00:00.000Z	NoCode	EastDallas	Thanks, also gnome-alsamixer works. :)
2010-01-07T12:00:00.000Z	EastDallas	NoCode	from CLI gnome-alsamixer
2010-01-07T12:00:00.000Z	EastDallas	NoCode	excellent!
2010-01-07T12:05:00.000Z	NoCode	EastDallas	Oh man, I think this helped a lot. Was that PCM wasn't getting adjusted when using the other applets I wonder?
2010-01-07T12:06:00.000Z	EastDallas	NoCode	NP.  Glad I could help!
2010-01-07T12:07:00.000Z	EastDallas	NoCode	I installed an old audigy card I had laying around a few weeks ago, and had to install Gnome Alsamixer to get it to work properly.
2010-01-07T12:07:00.000Z	NoCode	EastDallas	hmm, this is on a laptop. I've always had problems with 00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801H (ICH8 Family) HD Audio Controller (rev 03)
2010-01-07T12:08:00.000Z	EastDallas	NoCode	I can't get the mic to work on my laptop at all since upgrading to Karmic.
2010-01-07T12:09:00.000Z	NoCode	EastDallas	=\
2010-01-07T12:10:00.000Z	EastDallas	NoCode	they work on mine right out of the box
