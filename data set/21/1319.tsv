2012-10-31T21:27:00.000Z	cha0s_		any way to play H264 - MPEG-4 avc video format on ubuntu?
2012-10-31T21:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cha0s_	install ubuntu-restricted-extras vlc gnome-mplayer and w32codecs you should be able to play most things
2012-10-31T21:30:00.000Z	cha0s_	ActionParsnip	how do i install the w32codecs?
2012-10-31T21:31:00.000Z	cha0s_	ActionParsnip	not in software center
2012-10-31T21:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cha0s_	you need the medibuntu ppa adding
2012-10-31T21:32:00.000Z	cha0s_	ActionParsnip	How do I do this? I'm not that knowledgeable
2012-10-31T21:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cha0s_	https://duckduckgo.com/?q=medibuntu    too hard? I'm VERY sure you've done that before.....
2012-10-31T21:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cha0s_	why could you not get the page that I gave you?
2012-10-31T21:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cha0s_	yes but why did I have to get you the link? All I did was search the web and not very well. Why couldn't you do that?
2012-10-31T21:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cha0s_	doesn't mean you cannot websearch a little for yourself given the direction I gave you, does it?
2012-10-31T21:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cha0s_	instead of seeing an unfamiliar term nd panicing then asking for details, try searching a little and you'll be surprised what you find
2012-10-31T21:48:00.000Z	cha0s_	ActionParsnip	not tryingto be hard to get along with. just trying to get this info for the cops since I have no charger was hoping it would be faster asking in here
2012-10-31T21:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cha0s_	have you tried setting a different video output method in vlc
2012-10-31T21:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cha0s_	open VLC then set the output, then open the file
2012-10-31T21:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cha0s_	you can run VLC without having it open a file
2012-10-31T21:50:00.000Z	cha0s_	ActionParsnip	ok I have multiple choices for output but none specify if it will play the H264 any ideas?
2012-10-31T21:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cha0s_	try each in turn. I find X11 works friendliest
2012-10-31T21:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cha0s_	did you also try gnome-mplayer ?
2012-10-31T21:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cha0s_	try:  sudo apt-get install x264 libx264-123
2012-10-31T22:00:00.000Z	cha0s_	ActionParsnip	unable to locate package
2012-10-31T22:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cha0s_	which one? I gave 2
