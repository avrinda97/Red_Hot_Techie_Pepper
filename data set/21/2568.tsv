2012-11-03T12:22:00.000Z	rsv	Jordan_U	it is my 3 years of work
2012-11-03T12:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rsv	Then if you're currently booted from said Ubuntu install, shut down now and do the rest of whatever you're going to do from a LiveCD.
2012-11-03T12:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rsv	And please learn from this and keep good backups in the future.
2012-11-03T12:23:00.000Z	rsv	Jordan_U	what do i do now
2012-11-03T12:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rsv	http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec_Step_By_Step
2012-11-03T12:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rsv	First, as a quick check, please run "sudo blkid" and pastebin the output.
2012-11-03T12:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rsv	Did you understand my last comment?
2012-11-03T12:28:00.000Z	rsv	Jordan_U	http://pastebin.ca/2247853
2012-11-03T12:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rsv	Do you know why you have one ext3 partition and one ext4 partition? Do you have more than one GNU/Linux distribution installed?
2012-11-03T12:31:00.000Z	rsv	Jordan_U	 that is my boot partition
2012-11-03T12:33:00.000Z	rsv	Jordan_U	 doesnt photorec replicate my entire /home user accounts
2012-11-03T12:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rsv	No, it doesn't.
2012-11-03T12:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rsv	You're not going to get all your data back, and you're certainly not going to get all your settings and configuration back neatly either. This is why you really need backups in the future. Boot from a LiveCD/USB and follow the guide I linked to to get back as much as you can.
2012-11-03T12:36:00.000Z	rsv	Jordan_U	i mean the filenames
2012-11-03T12:36:00.000Z	rsv	Jordan_U	 the filenames appear as <some number>. <something>
2012-11-03T12:43:00.000Z	rsv	Jordan_U	 WHy doesnt photorec recover the filenames
