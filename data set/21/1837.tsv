2010-06-19T08:12:00.000Z	SoftwareExplorer	Zelozelos	Were are you changing the themes? System>Preferences>Appearance or somewhere else?
2010-06-19T08:13:00.000Z	Zelozelos	SoftwareExplorer	thats the cause of all the issues, i tried a few diff programs b4, incl emeral theme manager, umm,,,gnome color chooser, and also right-click, and appearance, but now none will change those colors
2010-06-19T08:16:00.000Z	Zelozelos	SoftwareExplorer	im not sure what i messed up, but im almost positive something is (its sorta in my blood to mess things up rofl) short of a full reinstall i have no idea how to restore to the out-of-the-box configuration
2010-06-19T08:17:00.000Z	SoftwareExplorer	Zelozelos	Hm, well the emerald is only supposed to change the window borders. In gnome-color-chooser, what did you change? Usually, you have to check a checkbox to change something from the default.
2010-06-19T08:18:00.000Z	Zelozelos	SoftwareExplorer	that does change a lot for me, im still filling my way around which is for what
2010-06-19T08:19:00.000Z	Zelozelos	SoftwareExplorer	do you know which ones change the ones i marked in the screenshot?
2010-06-19T08:19:00.000Z	SoftwareExplorer	Zelozelos	Not really, just that the defaults for gnome color chooser are pretty much to have nothing checked.
2010-06-19T08:20:00.000Z	SoftwareExplorer	Zelozelos	You might try logging out and logging back in. I used to have problems with the theme not changing while I was logged in and I would work around it by logging out and logging back in. That was back when lucid was in beta though, so it might be fixed now.
2010-06-19T08:21:00.000Z	Zelozelos	SoftwareExplorer	i already tried restarting n stuff,,,i wish it was like the *heh i hate to say* one win uses (it lets you choose an area by clicking on a border part of a window, font etc)
2010-06-19T08:23:00.000Z	Zelozelos	SoftwareExplorer	do u think if i uninstall the color chooser and others and retry appearance it will change those colors again?
2010-06-19T08:24:00.000Z	SoftwareExplorer	Zelozelos	Probably not.
2010-06-19T08:24:00.000Z	SoftwareExplorer	Zelozelos	It would probably just remove the programs you could use to change the settings, but not the settings.
2010-06-19T08:25:00.000Z	Zelozelos	SoftwareExplorer	looks like ill just have 2 keep on trying 2 find those areas...or eventually ill get so sick of the drab-ness ill reinstall |(
2010-06-19T08:26:00.000Z	SoftwareExplorer	Zelozelos	From what I understand, a "complete removal" as synaptic calls it only removes system wide settings that were set.
2010-06-19T08:26:00.000Z	SoftwareExplorer	Zelozelos	What happens if you create another user?
2010-06-19T08:27:00.000Z	Zelozelos	SoftwareExplorer	!!oh good freakin idea man!! ill give that a try
2010-06-19T08:27:00.000Z	Zelozelos	SoftwareExplorer	after i uninstall the others though right?
2010-06-19T08:28:00.000Z	SoftwareExplorer	Zelozelos	You mean users?
2010-06-19T08:28:00.000Z	Zelozelos		the other color/theme choosers etc
2010-06-19T08:29:00.000Z	SoftwareExplorer	Zelozelos	I don't think that would change anything. You should get a default theme in a new user, even if you have tools to change the theme installed.
2010-06-19T08:30:00.000Z	Zelozelos	SoftwareExplorer	kk ill give it a try, thanks for helping, if that dont work ill just deal w it untill i kill something else...muhahaa its inevitable that i break something bad enough to have 2 reinstall anyhow
