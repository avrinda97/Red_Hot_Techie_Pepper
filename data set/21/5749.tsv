2007-08-15T15:09:00.000Z	arvino		Hello can i get some help with my screen resolution i think its only 1024x768 but my laptop is designed to be 1920x1440 can anyone offer any suggestions, i have tried 915resolution but for some reason its not writing to my xorg.conf is it safe to just change the resolution in xorg.conf?
2007-08-15T15:10:00.000Z	arvino		my card is an intel, hence there is no res of 1920x1440 written into the bios so that if i want higher resolution is must force it, have i been misled?
2007-08-15T15:11:00.000Z	arvino		ok i will try and be back
2007-08-15T15:11:00.000Z	rausb0	arvino	i think 1920x1440 is beyond the hardware limits of the intel cards. you won't get that resolution even if you patch it into the bios.
2007-08-15T15:11:00.000Z	rausb0	arvino	which particular intel gfx card is it?
2007-08-15T15:13:00.000Z	rausb0	arvino	i think the i945GM can do 1600x1200 max. and only at 16bpp color depth. lower resolutions can have 24bpp.
2007-08-15T15:13:00.000Z	rausb0	arvino	but i'm not 100% sure
2007-08-15T15:14:00.000Z	rausb0	arvino	anyway, if you need to patch modes in the bios, you need to install the 915resolution package
2007-08-15T15:14:00.000Z	arvino	rausb0	i just found out i can use 1920 1440
2007-08-15T15:15:00.000Z	rausb0	arvino	good. at which color depth?
2007-08-15T15:15:00.000Z	arvino	rausb0	doesnt say i assume its crappy, can you suggets a good resolution to try for this laptop? so its not so blury on screen
2007-08-15T15:16:00.000Z	rausb0	arvino	i don't even know which laptop you have
2007-08-15T15:16:00.000Z	arvino	rausb0	sorry acer travelmate 2480 i guess i should just try 1440 900
2007-08-15T15:17:00.000Z	rausb0	arvino	try  sudo vbetool vbefp panelsize  to detect the size of the tft panel
2007-08-15T15:17:00.000Z	rausb0	arvino	just in case you don't know the native resolution of the tft
2007-08-15T15:18:00.000Z	arvino	rausb0	1280x800
2007-08-15T15:18:00.000Z	rausb0	arvino	then configure this resolution for X
2007-08-15T15:19:00.000Z	arvino	rausb0	done im going to try to restart x
2007-08-15T15:23:00.000Z	arvino	rausb0	beryl doesn't seem to work at this res though =( too laggy would that be right?
2007-08-15T15:25:00.000Z	rausb0	arvino	i don't use beryl, cannot help you with that
2007-08-15T15:27:00.000Z	arvino	rausb0	what was the command to reconfigure the xserv again
