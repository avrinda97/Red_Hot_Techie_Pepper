2010-12-14T22:58:00.000Z	crucialhoax		Anyone know why I cant sudo modprobe acerhdf? I get fatal errors
2010-12-14T22:58:00.000Z	undecim	crucialhoax	listing said errors might be useful
2010-12-14T22:58:00.000Z	crucialhoax		acerhdf.ko): No such device
2010-12-14T22:59:00.000Z	crucialhoax		But when I hit the tab key, acerhdf is one of the modules listed so I know its installed. Plus its been included in the kernel since 9.10
2010-12-14T23:00:00.000Z	undecim	crucialhoax	Either you don't have the device that it uses, or you need to load another module before acerhdf can see the device... Can you give me your laptop model?
2010-12-14T23:00:00.000Z	crucialhoax	undecim	Acer aspire one ao532h its a netbook
2010-12-14T23:01:00.000Z	undecim		sorry, xchat crashed just a moment ago
2010-12-14T23:01:00.000Z	crucialhoax	undecim	If I ls this directory: /lib/modules/2.6.35-23-generic/kernel/drivers/platform/x86/ it finds acerhdf.ko....
2010-12-14T23:01:00.000Z	undecim	crucialhoax	It's not a matter of finding the module... THe module can't find the hardware
2010-12-14T23:02:00.000Z	crucialhoax	undecim	Duh, gotcha. Reading is extremely helpful lol
2010-12-14T23:02:00.000Z	undecim	crucialhoax	So do you know the model of your laptop? often these types of problems are model-specific, and someone has already solved it.
2010-12-14T23:03:00.000Z	crucialhoax	undecim	Post 2 is my answer http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1540740
2010-12-14T23:04:00.000Z	crucialhoax	undecim	Thanks tho, I thought h/w didnt matter ha
2010-12-14T23:06:00.000Z	crucialhoax	undecim	Is it still safe to use it if its not supported?
2010-12-14T23:07:00.000Z	undecim	crucialhoax	as anglican explained on forum post, use at your own risk. In short, it just means the module hasn't been tested with your BIOS version.
2010-12-14T23:08:00.000Z	crucialhoax	undecim	Whats the worst that could happen?
2010-12-14T23:09:00.000Z	undecim	crucialhoax	The worst I see happening is it freezes your system, but it could always be worse
2010-12-14T23:09:00.000Z	undecim	crucialhoax	Computers are weird sometimes
2010-12-14T23:09:00.000Z	undecim	crucialhoax	but seeing as computers tend to be more robust nowadays, I don't think it would do anything catastrophic
2010-12-14T23:10:00.000Z	crucialhoax	undecim	Thanks for your help :)
