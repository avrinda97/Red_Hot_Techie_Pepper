2006-01-15T16:12:00.000Z	Blacken		Gawd...anyone know if there's a better installer in the pipe?
2006-01-15T16:13:00.000Z	cafuego	Blacken	By better I assume you mean "with buttons and mouse support" ?
2006-01-15T16:13:00.000Z	Blacken	cafuego	Bingo. This one has trouble in VMware, as does RedHat's text installer; oddly enough, RHL's GUI installer does not.
2006-01-15T16:14:00.000Z	cafuego	Blacken	The curses installs work fine in vmware for me.
2006-01-15T16:14:00.000Z	Blacken	cafuego	Well, the install has borked five times in a row, so maybe it's my VMware, but hey.
2006-01-15T16:14:00.000Z	cafuego	Blacken	I think that could be said to be a vmware issue anyway, not an installer one.
2006-01-15T16:14:00.000Z	Blacken	cafuego	Sure, it's a VMware issue--but a GUI install is still nice.
2006-01-15T16:15:00.000Z	Blacken	cafuego	Any idea why 5.10 might be giving me "cannot install /target/"
2006-01-15T16:21:00.000Z	Blacken	cafuego	...the installer keeps locking at "Verifying zlib1g" on VMware 4. Have you ever encountered/heard of this sort of problem?
2006-01-15T16:22:00.000Z	cafuego	Blacken	Did you burn the install cd yourself?
2006-01-15T16:22:00.000Z	Blacken	cafuego	Neg, these are ordered CDs.
2006-01-15T16:22:00.000Z	cafuego	Blacken	.. coz it sounds like a corruption. Can you check the md5sum of the one you're using?
2006-01-15T16:23:00.000Z	cafuego	Blacken	There should be an option in the advanced install menu on the cd.
2006-01-15T16:23:00.000Z	Blacken	cafuego	Ah, there is something. Thanks.
2006-01-15T16:24:00.000Z	cafuego	Blacken	Not the CD, it verifies the packages though... then it might break if one fails.
2006-01-15T16:24:00.000Z	cafuego	Blacken	It's not impossible that you swiped a dud ;-)
2006-01-15T16:24:00.000Z	Blacken	cafuego	I'm sure, but I'm a Windows user who dabbles in Linux.  I want the damned thing to Just Work.
2006-01-15T16:25:00.000Z	Blacken	cafuego	If I could get the Christing thing working right, I'd just install DSL.
2006-01-15T16:25:00.000Z	cafuego	Blacken	I'm sure 99 out of 100 cds do "just work" :-)  Just swipe another one, it's what they're for.
2006-01-15T16:31:00.000Z	Blacken	cafuego	You can? Stably?
2006-01-15T16:31:00.000Z	cafuego	Blacken	Never failed for me sofar. ext2fsd.sf.net
