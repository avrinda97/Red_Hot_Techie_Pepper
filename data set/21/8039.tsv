2006-06-07T08:49:00.000Z	Seveas	makko	because seb128 already has it
2006-06-07T08:50:00.000Z	makko	Seveas	who's seb128 and does he have a repo?
2006-06-07T08:50:00.000Z	Seveas	makko	seb128 is the Ubuntu gnome guru and yes: people.ubuntu.com/~seb128
2006-06-07T08:51:00.000Z	makko	Seveas	farous said you have skype in your dapper repo, but i don't find it. does seb128 have it too?
2006-06-07T08:51:00.000Z	Seveas	makko	I don't have skype for dapper yet, only for breezy
2006-06-07T08:52:00.000Z	makko	Seveas	could you please add xlibs to your repo? it's just about 90 kb and it's helpful for opera backwards compatibility.
2006-06-07T08:52:00.000Z	makko	Seveas	it is in the main breezy repo
2006-06-07T08:52:00.000Z	makko	Seveas	but dapper doesn't have it, so opera won't install on dapper
2006-06-07T08:53:00.000Z	Seveas	makko	no. Opera just haveto fix their crap.
2006-06-07T08:54:00.000Z	makko	Seveas	maybe you're right
2006-06-07T08:54:00.000Z	Seveas	makko	I know I am right ;)
2006-06-07T08:54:00.000Z	makko	Seveas	is it the same about skype? or what is the reason you don't have it yet?
2006-06-07T08:55:00.000Z	makko	Seveas	:))
2006-06-07T08:55:00.000Z	Seveas	makko	no, for skype I simply didn't have the time yet and the .deb package from skype.com should work
2006-06-07T08:56:00.000Z	makko	Seveas	what's wrong about "deb http://people.ubuntu.com/~jbailey/snapshot/bzr/ ./"? it simply won't work.
2006-06-07T09:00:00.000Z	makko	Seveas	would there any problem if i added your breezy repo along with your dapper repo?
2006-06-07T09:02:00.000Z	Seveas	makko	not that I know of, but if you add it just for breezy only add the extras section
2006-06-07T09:04:00.000Z	makko	Seveas	thank you
2006-06-07T09:05:00.000Z	makko	Seveas	any idea why i am getting this error: "http://people.ubuntu.com/~jbailey/snapshot/bzr/./Release: No MD5Sum entry in Release file /var/lib/apt/lists/people.ubuntu.com_%7ejbailey_snapshot_bzr_._Release"?
2006-06-07T09:06:00.000Z	Seveas	makko	no
2006-06-07T09:39:00.000Z	Seveas	makko	use a mirror.
