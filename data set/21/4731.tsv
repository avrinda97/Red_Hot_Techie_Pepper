2008-10-10T21:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	jim_p	but better use the /dev/scd0 node
2008-10-10T21:12:00.000Z	jim_p	erUSUL	thanks
2008-10-10T21:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	jim_p	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4 2008-10-10 13:24 /dev/sr0 -> scd0
2008-10-10T21:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	jim_p	sr0 is just a link
2008-10-11T18:39:00.000Z	erUSUL	jim_p	iirc checkinstall installs the deb at the end of the process
2008-10-11T18:40:00.000Z	jim_p	erUSUL	well it was not installed, i was making madwifi and it is not installed, not even a .deb here!
2008-10-11T18:41:00.000Z	jim_p	erUSUL	iirc = ?
2008-10-11T18:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	jim_p	if i recall correctly
2008-10-11T18:41:00.000Z	jim_p	erUSUL	lol ok
2008-10-11T18:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	jim_p	i dunno if checkinstall works well with kernel modules it is meant for userspace apps
2008-10-11T18:42:00.000Z	jim_p	erUSUL	so there is a chance that some kernel thing prevented it?
2008-10-11T18:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	jim_p	never tried using checkinstall with kernel modules so i dunno for sure
2008-10-11T18:45:00.000Z	jim_p	erUSUL	ok thanks a lot
2008-10-27T15:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	jim_p	yes
2008-10-27T15:58:00.000Z	jim_p	erUSUL	thanks
2008-12-22T17:52:00.000Z	jim_p	erUSUL	then why kde keeps them?
2008-12-22T17:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	jim_p	it uses a clippboard manager by default like (g|k)lipper. gnome does not use one neither do other Desktop Envoirments and/or window managers
2008-12-22T17:55:00.000Z	jim_p	erUSUL	so... kde already has the thing that is supposed to exist in every de!
2009-01-03T22:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	jim_p	gthumb ? gtkam ?
