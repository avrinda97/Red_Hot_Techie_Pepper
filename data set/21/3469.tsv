2009-07-04T21:08:00.000Z	OrEvA	scunizi	: its already unchecked
2009-07-04T21:09:00.000Z	scunizi	OrEvA	did you hit the "refresh" key?
2009-07-04T21:09:00.000Z	OrEvA	scunizi	: yes
2009-07-04T21:10:00.000Z	OrEvA	scunizi	: this is the complete error that I am getting "http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/209863/"
2009-07-04T21:11:00.000Z	OrEvA	scunizi	: the problem started when I installed google desktop
2009-07-04T21:13:00.000Z	scunizi	OrEvA	Synaptic will also search for the best repo.. have you tried that?
2009-07-04T21:14:00.000Z	OrEvA	scunizi	: I used to download the same way but it doesn't download
2009-07-04T21:14:00.000Z	scunizi	OrEvA	Google desktop isn't all that necessary since ubuntu has a several options for indexing files on your pc.. I never did like those desktop bars..
2009-07-04T21:15:00.000Z	OrEvA	scunizi	: I didn't like it either .................. but now see whats happening
2009-07-04T21:15:00.000Z	scunizi	OrEvA	it doesn't download because it's looking at "localhost" which is your computer.. maybe you should uninstall google desktop and try again.. although I suspect there is a better solution but I don't know what it is.
2009-07-04T21:16:00.000Z	OrEvA	scunizi	: I've uninstalled it ... didn't use longer than a day
2009-07-04T21:16:00.000Z	scunizi	OrEvA	ok.. there is a way to reconfigure the dpkg system.. hang on..
2009-07-04T21:17:00.000Z	OrEvA	scunizi	: ok

2009-07-04T21:29:00.000Z	scunizi	OrEvA	sorry I'm stuck at this point.. maybe someone else knows the answer
2009-07-04T21:30:00.000Z	OrEvA	scunizi	: thanx for your effort
2009-07-04T21:30:00.000Z	scunizi	OrEvA	np.. I just wish we had actually gotten somewhere.
