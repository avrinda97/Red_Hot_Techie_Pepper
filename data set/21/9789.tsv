2005-07-10T08:36:00.000Z	bulletproof		I manually rm'ed the files it couldn't overwrite from the command line - I'm starting to regret that now
2005-07-10T08:37:00.000Z	virtuald	bulletproof	try apt-get --reinstall install <package>
2005-07-10T08:40:00.000Z	bulletproof	virtuald	no idea what that is
2005-07-10T08:41:00.000Z	bulletproof	virtuald	oh yeah - I know what you mean - but I ain't got a browser now - lol
2005-07-10T08:47:00.000Z	virtuald	bulletproof	remove backports from sources.list, run apt-get update, apt-get clean and then apt-get install mozilla-firefox
2005-07-10T08:48:00.000Z	bulletproof	virtuald	will give that a shot now
2005-07-10T08:51:00.000Z	bulletproof	virtuald	same error - removed by backports (mirror) from the repository list
2005-07-10T08:52:00.000Z	virtuald	bulletproof	did you run both apt-get update and apt-get clean?
2005-07-10T08:54:00.000Z	bulletproof	virtuald	yes m8
2005-07-10T08:54:00.000Z	virtuald	bulletproof	then there must still be a backports line in sources.ilst
2005-07-10T08:57:00.000Z	bulletproof	virtuald	I just double checked the only uncommmented deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu hoary-updates main restricted
2005-07-10T08:57:00.000Z	bulletproof	virtuald	and the security one
2005-07-10T08:58:00.000Z	virtuald	bulletproof	apt-get remove mozilla-firefox firefox
2005-07-10T08:58:00.000Z	virtuald	bulletproof	and firefox-gnome-support
2005-07-10T09:00:00.000Z	bulletproof	virtuald	k - what next? install firefox?
2005-07-10T09:00:00.000Z	virtuald	bulletproof	yes :)
2005-07-10T09:01:00.000Z	bulletproof	virtuald	seems to be installing 8mb so will take a couple of minutes
2005-07-10T09:04:00.000Z	bulletproof	virtuald	intstalled okay - but won't load... I get t a "starting mozilla firfox " but then it don't load :(
