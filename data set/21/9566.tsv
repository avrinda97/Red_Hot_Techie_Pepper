2005-09-10T13:08:00.000Z	funkyHat		esd works fine for me, except for a >1 second delay >:(
2005-09-10T13:08:00.000Z	funkyHat		so i use alsa and aoss
2005-09-10T13:09:00.000Z	funkyHat		i'll go read their question ;)
2005-09-10T13:11:00.000Z	funkyHat		(in the way i said: system > preferences > multimedia systems selector)
2005-09-10T13:11:00.000Z	LaserLine	funkyHat	That's what I did...
2005-09-10T13:11:00.000Z	LaserLine	funkyHat	I followed the Howto in Ubuntuguide.org
2005-09-10T13:11:00.000Z	LaserLine	funkyHat	and installed libsdl1.2debian-all for sound in Frozen-Bubble.
2005-09-10T13:15:00.000Z	funkyHat	LaserLine	ask in #alsa if the driver for your soundcard supports hardware mixing
2005-09-10T13:16:00.000Z	funkyHat		if not, the issue may be that you need to update to alsa 1.0.9b
2005-09-10T13:16:00.000Z	funkyHat		also it may be that you need to killall esd
2005-09-10T13:17:00.000Z	LaserLine	funkyHat	- On this server ?
2005-09-10T13:17:00.000Z	funkyHat		(well, upgrade to 1.0.9b, or set up DMIX manually, i know which i'd rather do
2005-09-10T13:17:00.000Z	funkyHat		yeah, this server
2005-09-10T13:22:00.000Z	LaserLine	funkyHat	- What should I select at Defaule Source in the Gnome Multimedia Selector ? I chose default sink ALSA
2005-09-10T13:24:00.000Z	funkyHat	LaserLine	it doesn't matter at all if you're not using a microphone with that card
2005-09-10T13:24:00.000Z	LaserLine	funkyHat	so the Default Sink should be ALSA and the Default Source doesn't matter ? (now it's OSS)
2005-09-10T13:25:00.000Z	funkyHat		doesn't matter unless you're going to be using audio inputs
2005-09-10T13:25:00.000Z	funkyHat		and if you are, i don't know what it should be ;)
2005-09-10T13:25:00.000Z	LaserLine	funkyHat	LoL :D
2005-09-10T13:26:00.000Z	funkyHat		what did the guys over in #alsa say about your card?
2005-09-10T13:26:00.000Z	LaserLine	funkyHat	there are 29 ppl on #alsa but none speaks........
