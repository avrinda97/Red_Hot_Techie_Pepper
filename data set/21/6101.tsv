2010-05-20T21:22:00.000Z	nicofs		I need help installing ubuntu. i can't install it to the desired partition... my hdd has 6 partitions but the installation programme displays only 4 (the last 3 partitions being merged into one) what should i do? weirdly enough, all 6 partitions except the last one can be mounted... and the last one is where my ubuntu should go...
2010-05-20T21:23:00.000Z	Anarhist	nicofs	it may be displaying the 'extended' partition
2010-05-20T21:24:00.000Z	Anarhist	nicofs	i can't really know for sure however
2010-05-20T21:25:00.000Z	Anarhist	nicofs	i'm trying to think
2010-05-20T21:29:00.000Z	Anarhist	nicofs	no, that's not what i meant... q; -)=   i meant "give me a second"... do you see your partition table right now?
2010-05-20T21:30:00.000Z	Anarhist	nicofs	yeah, start gparted, let's see if we can sort that out
2010-05-20T21:32:00.000Z	Anarhist	nicofs	what did you see under the windows
2010-05-20T21:35:00.000Z	Anarhist	nicofs	let's try a different (more bruteforce) utility, in terminal do "sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda" where sda is your drive
2010-05-20T21:36:00.000Z	Anarhist	nicofs	it will list the table of drives and exit without making any changes
2010-05-20T21:36:00.000Z	Anarhist	nicofs	sorry, i should have said that myself
2010-05-20T21:36:00.000Z	Anarhist	nicofs	man fdisk   if you want to check
2010-05-20T21:38:00.000Z	Anarhist	nicofs	same thing?
2010-05-20T21:38:00.000Z	Anarhist	nicofs	ouch
2010-05-20T21:40:00.000Z	Anarhist	nicofs	you don't have something weird installed, some whole drive encryption or something else like that? because i'm sort of out of ideas how this can be
2010-05-20T21:43:00.000Z	Anarhist	nicofs	that wouldn't break anything... i'd recommend rebooting into windows again, and rechecking the disk table... maybe even delete the partition you want to install ubuntu to, so that it will be empty space, you can create the new partition during the installation of ubuntu
2010-05-20T21:44:00.000Z	Anarhist	nicofs	don't create
2010-05-20T21:44:00.000Z	Anarhist	nicofs	let it be empty and see what happens
2010-05-20T21:45:00.000Z	Anarhist	nicofs	and when you did that the last partition was still showing up as being as large as from start to the end of the drive?
2010-05-20T21:45:00.000Z	Anarhist	nicofs	did you ever resize that partition?
2010-05-20T21:47:00.000Z	Anarhist	nicofs	have you ever (in the past) resized the partition that now shows up to include other partitions beyond it
2010-05-20T21:50:00.000Z	Anarhist	nicofs	i'm sorry, i have a feeling that somehow the disk table got corrupted somehow... i don't have enough knowledge to really help you, q; -(=
