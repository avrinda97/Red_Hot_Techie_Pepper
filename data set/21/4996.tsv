2009-04-17T15:49:00.000Z	cemc		!compiz
2009-04-17T15:49:00.000Z	cemc		what do I have to install to configure compiz in more detail?
2009-04-17T15:49:00.000Z	cemc		there was some package for it, some gnome-compiz-config, or compiz-config-something...
2009-04-17T15:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cemc	make sure you have 3d accelleration (video drivers) installed then install compizconfig-settings-manager
2009-05-01T15:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cemc	the only difference between is the DE and WM, the rest is identical, you can install as many of these as you have space if you so wish
2009-05-01T15:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cemc	if you install kubuntu-desktop you can use gnome or kde, with a clean install youo willonly have 1
2009-05-01T15:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cemc	you will also be able to use the gnome apps in kde as you have the required libs to run them
2009-05-01T16:41:00.000Z	cemc	ActionParsnip	the method you suggester removes 90 packages, but 190 were installed with kubuntu-desktop
2009-05-01T16:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cemc	thats all i know
2009-05-01T16:53:00.000Z	cemc	ActionParsnip	mpontillo: thanks for the help
