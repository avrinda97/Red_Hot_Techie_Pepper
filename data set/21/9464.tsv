2005-09-24T10:10:00.000Z	odatubuntu		anyone able to help with networking?
2005-09-24T10:11:00.000Z	Jowi	odatubuntu	that is a very general question
2005-09-24T10:11:00.000Z	odatubuntu	Jowi	i have a xp machine that i am able to access from ubuntu but not visa versa
2005-09-24T10:12:00.000Z	Jowi	odatubuntu	via what? ssh, samba?
2005-09-24T10:14:00.000Z	Jowi	odatubuntu	have a look there :-)
2005-09-24T11:30:00.000Z	Jowi	odatubuntu	back from shopping. can you put your /etc/samba/smb.conf in the pastebin please
2005-09-24T11:35:00.000Z	Jowi	odatubuntu	ok, brb
2005-09-24T11:41:00.000Z	Jowi	odatubuntu	might be that your share name is a bit off since it contain a space. try to put quotes around it and try to add this to the bottom of the smb.conf: force group = sambauser. Also, make sure that your workgroup "MSHOME" is set to the same in Windows. When you try to connect to Ubuntu from Windows it should pop up a dialog box asking for a user and a password. does it?
2005-09-24T11:42:00.000Z	Jowi	odatubuntu	then disable the firewall
2005-09-24T11:42:00.000Z	Jowi	odatubuntu	in winxp; disable firewall.
2005-09-24T11:43:00.000Z	Jowi	odatubuntu	when it ask you for a username and password you just have to use your own ubuntu username and password. Yeah i use zonealarm on my Win2k machine and it DOES block traffic anyway. you should minimum see the ubuntu share. if you don't its probably zonealarm blocking it.
2005-09-24T11:45:00.000Z	Jowi	odatubuntu	as soon as i disable zonealarm i am able to see my ubuntu share :)
2005-09-24T11:52:00.000Z	Jowi	odatubuntu	so it worked fine by shutting down zonealarm?
2005-09-24T11:55:00.000Z	Jowi	odatubuntu	exactly what are you doing and what happens. Swat the game?
2005-09-24T11:56:00.000Z	Jowi	odatubuntu	yeah, i know thanks :-)
2005-09-24T11:56:00.000Z	Jowi	odatubuntu	but i don't use it myself.
2005-09-24T11:57:00.000Z	Jowi	odatubuntu	in the link https://wiki.ubuntu.com//SettingUpSamba you will see there how to add a samba user.
2005-09-24T11:58:00.000Z	Jowi	odatubuntu	it's about on the middle of the page. read it and follow the guide. you can not fail.
2005-09-24T12:00:00.000Z	Jowi	odatubuntu	i followed the guide and had no probs setting it up. works flawless here. you probably missed a step somewhere.
2005-09-24T12:04:00.000Z	Jowi	odatubuntu	i don't have it either. it works for me anyway. alright. strange though.
