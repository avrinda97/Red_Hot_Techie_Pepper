2005-06-04T11:13:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		that's an ubuntu kernel.  it's through apt-get.
2005-06-04T11:13:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		sata dvdrw
2005-06-04T11:13:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		idiot?
2005-06-04T11:13:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		sata is way better than ata.
2005-06-04T11:14:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		nice thin cables.  extremely high throughput when reading from cache.
2005-06-04T11:14:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		scythe no..like 80$
2005-06-04T11:14:00.000Z	xoz	BROKEN_LADDER	are you sure it's sata?
2005-06-04T11:14:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	xoz	absolutely positively.
2005-06-04T11:14:00.000Z	xoz	BROKEN_LADDER	maybe, there is no driver yet for that. try google.
2005-06-04T11:15:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	xoz	my sata dvd drive works great.
2005-06-04T11:15:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	xoz	the problem is my flash memory.
2005-06-04T11:16:00.000Z	xoz	BROKEN_LADDER	can you try hwinfo?
2005-06-04T11:17:00.000Z	xoz	BROKEN_LADDER	it seems it recognizes your flash to be cdrom?
2005-06-04T11:19:00.000Z	xoz	BROKEN_LADDER	what about ehci-hcd?
2005-06-04T11:20:00.000Z	xoz	BROKEN_LADDER	it is for usb 2.0
2005-06-04T11:20:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	xoz	what is?
2005-06-04T11:23:00.000Z	xoz	BROKEN_LADDER	can you load it? since usb-storage may need it if your sata is emulated as usb storage device?
