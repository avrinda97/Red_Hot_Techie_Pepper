2011-12-10T10:09:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	skilz	depending on your conky set up and refresh/reload rates you've set conky will probably take 1-5% of cpu at almost all times
2011-12-10T10:10:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	skilz	yes we heard.
2011-12-10T10:10:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	skilz	wait a few seconds

2011-12-10T10:28:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	skilz	can't remember if you need to change 'splash' to 'nosplash'
2011-12-10T10:29:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	skilz	at boot, when at grub press 'e' at the kernel of your choice
