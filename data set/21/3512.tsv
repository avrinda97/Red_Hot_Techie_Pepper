2011-09-01T12:33:00.000Z	norbert_		hi all, I have a question
2011-09-01T12:33:00.000Z	norbert_		somebody has accessed a server I'm also working on as root
2011-09-01T12:33:00.000Z	norbert_		I would like to find out what the IP address was of that other person that used the root account
2011-09-01T12:33:00.000Z	norbert_		any ideas?
2011-09-01T12:33:00.000Z	qin	norbert_	last lastlog /var/log/auth.log
2011-09-01T12:34:00.000Z	norbert_	qin	there is no *auth* in /var/log
2011-09-01T12:35:00.000Z	qin	norbert_	ups.
2011-09-01T12:35:00.000Z	norbert_	qin	what does that mean... is that a bad thing? :|
2011-09-01T12:36:00.000Z	qin	norbert_	/var/log/auth.log is kind of important, do you have syslog?
2011-09-01T12:37:00.000Z	norbert_	qin	ls /var/log/syslog has no results
2011-09-01T12:40:00.000Z	qin	norbert_	is your rsyslogd running?
2011-09-01T12:40:00.000Z	norbert_	qin	root      3347  0.0  0.0   5932   576 ?        Ss   Jun08   3:48 syslogd -m 0
2011-09-01T12:42:00.000Z	qin	norbert_	So what logs do you have (and how acctual they are)?
2011-09-01T12:42:00.000Z	norbert_	qin	I have /var/log/messages*
2011-09-01T12:43:00.000Z	norbert_	qin	but that doesn't contain the word "ssh"
2011-09-01T12:45:00.000Z	qin	norbert_	ask your provider for his logs. Nuke server.
2011-09-01T12:46:00.000Z	qin	norbert_	Btw, what made you think that someone accesse your box?
2011-09-01T12:47:00.000Z	norbert_	qin	bash_history has commands that I didn't type, and when I start mysql and check the scrollbar (arrow up) I see commands I didn't type
2011-09-01T12:48:00.000Z	qin	norbert_	Well, if you have time and power, you can turn your box into honeypot, or just nuke it.
2011-09-01T12:50:00.000Z	qin	norbert_	is it vps?
2011-09-01T13:19:00.000Z	norbert_	qin	by the way, thanks for all the information ;)
