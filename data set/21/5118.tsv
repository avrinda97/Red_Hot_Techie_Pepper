2008-01-24T20:03:00.000Z	punkshui		my partition editor is only allowing me to have 4 partitions but i need to create a new partition. is it possible to combine my /home and / partitions into one safely?
2008-01-24T20:03:00.000Z	SleepingSloth	punkshui	- if by 'safely' you mean without needing to back up first, then no
2008-01-24T20:03:00.000Z	punkshui	SleepingSloth	already backed up. i just mean and maintain OS functionality
2008-01-24T20:04:00.000Z	SleepingSloth	punkshui	- ok. i am not an expert - but i've heard way too amany 'complaints' about re-partitions failing and causing data loss....
2008-01-24T20:05:00.000Z	punkshui	SleepingSloth	i'm not worried about data loss
2008-01-24T20:07:00.000Z	SleepingSloth	punkshui	- afaik, the mounts are the only important thing - so I think you could do it, but you'd need someone more knowledgeable than me
2008-01-24T20:08:00.000Z	SleepingSloth	punkshui	- I mean, i you wereto unmount your /home directory, you could still put things in it (from disk, presumably)
2008-01-24T20:08:00.000Z	punkshui	SleepingSloth	its not possible to umount my /home directory while booted into linux from the HDD
2008-01-24T20:10:00.000Z	SleepingSloth	punkshui	- err.... not from outside x?
2008-01-24T20:11:00.000Z	punkshui	SleepingSloth	I dont know this is all becoming too complicated. you see im trying to recreate the DellUtility partition (I thought I only needed the DellRestore partition)
2008-01-24T20:11:00.000Z	punkshui		genii I am trying to restore my system to its factory settings but I need to recreate a Utility partition that was on here before..
2008-01-24T20:12:00.000Z	punkshui		genii i have too many partitions to recreate it. however the space which the partition used before is still there.. untouched its just no longer a partition anymore
2008-01-24T20:13:00.000Z	SleepingSloth	punkshui	- if you still have the space, why cant you use it?
2008-01-24T20:14:00.000Z	SleepingSloth	punkshui	- what partitioning software?
2008-01-24T20:14:00.000Z	punkshui		genii actually i was trying to make it so i only have a / partition. i dont want my /home partition anymore
2008-01-24T20:14:00.000Z	punkshui		genii i want it reallocated into /
2008-01-24T20:14:00.000Z	punkshui	SleepingSloth	gparted
2008-01-24T20:16:00.000Z	SleepingSloth	punkshui	- so, you have four primary partitions at the moment and no extended partitions?
2008-01-24T20:17:00.000Z	punkshui		genii i see. any ideas for this unallocated space.. presumably it still has all the files I need there. its just not a partition anymore... if i create it as say a fat16 partition would the files formerly there return?
2008-01-24T20:17:00.000Z	punkshui	SleepingSloth	correct
2008-01-24T20:19:00.000Z	SleepingSloth	punkshui	- in that case, i'm no expert, but i would have thought you could make one of your partitions into an extended one, and then put the remaining 2 partitions inside it
