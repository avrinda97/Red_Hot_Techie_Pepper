2011-04-20T16:24:00.000Z	Soothsayer		I installed ubuntu on a laptop... i completely formatted it to ext3 with a 3gb swap space partition
2011-04-20T16:24:00.000Z	Soothsayer		but for some reason, my laptop will never shutdown or hibernate
2011-04-20T16:24:00.000Z	Soothsayer		always gets hung in the process / ubuntu logo animation
2011-04-20T16:24:00.000Z	MK``	Soothsayer	can it suspend?
2011-04-20T16:24:00.000Z	Soothsayer	MK``	hmm.. not tried a suspend
2011-04-20T16:28:00.000Z	Soothsayer	MK``	ok no, i can't suspend either.
2011-04-27T00:24:00.000Z	MK``	Soothsayer	yes, you can always use the desktop environment of your choice
2011-04-27T00:25:00.000Z	Soothsayer	MK``	is it too much configuration?
2011-04-27T00:25:00.000Z	Soothsayer	MK``	oh I see
2011-04-27T00:25:00.000Z	Soothsayer	MK``	what about gnome 3 ?
2011-04-27T00:26:00.000Z	MK``	Soothsayer	I do not know if you can have GNOME 2 and GNOME 3 running at the same time :( that is out of my field of expertise
2011-04-27T00:27:00.000Z	Soothsayer	MK``	why does Ubuntu have gnome 2 and not 3 ?
2011-04-27T00:29:00.000Z	Soothsayer	MK``	GNOME Shell is the default thing right
2011-04-27T00:30:00.000Z	Soothsayer	MK``	I see. GNOME 3 looks attractive
2011-04-27T00:30:00.000Z	MK``	Soothsayer	in 10.10, yes, GNOME Shell is the default. 11.04 comes with it as well as a fallback incase you don't have 3D support
2011-04-27T00:31:00.000Z	Soothsayer	MK``	the fallback is ?
2011-04-27T00:31:00.000Z	MK``	Soothsayer	GNOME Shell :P labelled "Ubuntu classic" in the selector menu
2011-04-27T00:32:00.000Z	Soothsayer	MK``	what was the need for Unity... I really don't like it... and plus it's like GNOME 3
2011-04-27T00:32:00.000Z	MK``	Soothsayer	Shuttleworth likes it, apparently XD
2011-04-27T00:36:00.000Z	Soothsayer	MK``	Darael : So I should upgrade to Ubuntu 11.04 before installing GNOME 3?
2011-04-27T00:36:00.000Z	MK``	Soothsayer	I don't know
