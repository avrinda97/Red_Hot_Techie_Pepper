2008-07-10T09:39:00.000Z	krsnadasa		any one ?
2008-07-10T09:40:00.000Z	sn9_	krsnadasa	just type that
2008-07-10T09:41:00.000Z	krsnadasa	sn9_	yea i did but does it just automatically use that firmware ?
2008-07-10T09:41:00.000Z	krsnadasa	sn9_	or is there some kind of command i have to use ?
2008-07-10T09:41:00.000Z	sn9_	krsnadasa	should
2008-07-10T09:41:00.000Z	krsnadasa	sn9_	automatically ?
2008-07-10T09:44:00.000Z	krsnadasa	sn9_	thanks
2008-07-10T12:34:00.000Z	krsnadasa	sn9_	know anything about wireless drivers?
2008-07-10T12:35:00.000Z	sn9_	krsnadasa	yes
2008-07-10T12:35:00.000Z	krsnadasa	sn9_	^^
2008-07-10T12:36:00.000Z	sn9_	krsnadasa	yes, use an older one
2008-07-10T12:36:00.000Z	krsnadasa	sn9_	:9 but do the older ones support injection in aircrack ?
2008-07-10T12:37:00.000Z	sn9_	krsnadasa	no -- you're in a bind then
2008-07-10T12:37:00.000Z	krsnadasa	sn9_	can the new one even do that ?
2008-07-10T12:38:00.000Z	sn9_	krsnadasa	i think it's in development
2008-07-10T12:38:00.000Z	krsnadasa	sn9_	i saw a posting aobut osmeone getting injection to work but dosent seem like that when i tried
2008-07-10T12:40:00.000Z	krsnadasa	sn9_	airdriver says it supports 4965 but when i try to install it, it gives me a funky erroe
2008-07-10T12:46:00.000Z	sn9_	krsnadasa	generally, the one installed by default, but not for injection
2008-07-10T12:47:00.000Z	krsnadasa	sn9_	but does the newest support injection ?
2008-07-10T12:48:00.000Z	krsnadasa	sn9_	also when i run airdriver installed i don't see the 4965 ?
