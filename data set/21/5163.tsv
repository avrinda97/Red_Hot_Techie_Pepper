2009-11-08T11:32:00.000Z	TylerNT		video drivers are pretty much the crutch of all OS's..
2009-11-08T11:34:00.000Z	TylerNT		yah I've flash issues with compiz
2009-11-08T11:34:00.000Z	TylerNT		turns out flash+compiz doesn't like to let the left mouse button work
2009-11-08T11:36:00.000Z	soreau	TylerNT	Does it still happen even when you disable effects?
2009-11-08T11:36:00.000Z	TylerNT		no it doesn't.. but if I right click and hold I can then left click normally
2009-11-08T11:44:00.000Z	TylerNT		Marco: you may want to check the switches and mute setting in pulse audio.. ubuntu automatically mutes and disables all inputs on my machine by default
2009-11-08T11:46:00.000Z	TylerNT		go to sound prefs by right clicking the sound manager applet and check the settings in there first
2009-11-08T11:49:00.000Z	TylerNT		I think he's talking about running servlets
2009-11-08T11:50:00.000Z	TylerNT	ekontsevoy	if you upgraded from 9.04 then I can tell you I had to delete my setting files for my account to get the menus to come back
2009-11-08T11:52:00.000Z	TylerNT		and you can't view admin->login ?
2009-11-08T11:54:00.000Z	TylerNT		you need servers to run those host those files
2009-11-08T11:55:00.000Z	TylerNT		like apache and wambat
2009-11-08T11:55:00.000Z	TylerNT		then you need the server hooks for perl
2009-11-08T11:59:00.000Z	TylerNT		arvind: well that's one way to do it.. you can also setup apache to run those files itself and block them from people trying to wget them.
2009-11-08T12:02:00.000Z	TylerNT		vortex: what's it doing?
2009-11-08T12:03:00.000Z	TylerNT		I think your talking about the same issue I'm having with compiz and flash
2009-11-08T12:04:00.000Z	TylerNT		you should be able to hold your right mouse button and then click on stuff in the flash frame
2009-11-08T12:05:00.000Z	TylerNT		with all of the work on gnome 3 I don't think anyone really cares about compiz right now
2009-11-08T12:06:00.000Z	TylerNT		I did install them.. but I haven't checked flash yet
2009-11-08T12:07:00.000Z	TylerNT		nah the updates did nothing
2009-11-08T12:07:00.000Z	soreau	TylerNT	You're wrong
