2011-10-22T16:04:00.000Z	Newbeeans		I think I should join ubuntu so they can design an OS for dummies.

2011-10-22T16:08:00.000Z	sandra_	Newbeeans	I can install the 32 bit version but once installed it will not boot into usermode..now Natty 11.04 just simply loads.
2011-10-24T18:33:00.000Z	Newbeeans	sandra_	I still have the same problem :-/
2011-10-24T18:33:00.000Z	sandra_	Newbeeans	refresh my memory what problem is that ?
2011-10-24T18:34:00.000Z	sandra_	Newbeeans	can you see Ubuntu when you boot off the live iso ?
2011-10-24T18:35:00.000Z	Newbeeans	sandra_	Yes
2011-10-24T18:36:00.000Z	sandra_	Newbeeans	are using a CD or USB live verion of Ubuntu ?
2011-10-24T18:37:00.000Z	sandra_	Newbeeans	can you create a usb key of Ubuntu ?
2011-10-24T18:38:00.000Z	sandra_	Newbeeans	Ouch
2011-10-24T18:38:00.000Z	Newbeeans	sandra_	yeah I'm not impressed with linux thus far
2011-10-24T18:38:00.000Z	sandra_	Newbeeans	I'm sorry to hear that so far Ubuntu as worked very well for me.
2011-10-24T18:40:00.000Z	sandra_	Newbeeans	I'm sure it's just a set up problem. If you can see what's on your screen in the live mode you should be able to see your screen once it's installed.
2011-10-24T18:42:00.000Z	sandra_	Newbeeans	please reinstall Ubuntu 11.10 tell it erase and use the entire hard drive.

2011-10-24T18:53:00.000Z	sandra_	Newbeeans	this time around please select the erase hd  and use the entire hard drive for Ubuntu.
2011-10-25T18:12:00.000Z	Newbeeans	sandra_	I tried but it failed to find any plugins :)
2011-10-25T18:12:00.000Z	sandra_	Newbeeans	if you would like a quick and painless way to add flash is to go to this site provided Firefox is your web browser of choice
2011-10-25T18:18:00.000Z	sandra_	Newbeeans	do you have access to the Ubuntu software center ?
