2009-10-04T04:35:00.000Z	Black_Phantom		is it safe upgrading from 8.04 all the way to 9.10 ?
2009-10-04T04:35:00.000Z	Black_Phantom		sebastien, BETA
2009-10-04T04:35:00.000Z	Black_Phantom		yeah I meant beta
2009-10-04T04:36:00.000Z	Black_Phantom		because the dvd recorder rotted i guess, and i spent 4 cds trying to burn @ very low speeds but it didnt work
2009-10-04T04:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Black_Phantom	yeah let's continue there
2009-10-04T04:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Black_Phantom	9.10 isn't out yet
2009-10-04T04:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Black_Phantom	and when it is I suggest you clean install Ubuntu for 9.10
2009-10-04T04:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Black_Phantom	beta is not final
2009-11-30T07:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Black_Phantom	 GamerKnight  old news that they donated quite a bit of money, whenever it was now
2009-11-30T07:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Black_Phantom	 GamerKnight  also I guess really it was Mark Shuttleworth since as far as  I know Canonical still don't make a profit
2009-11-30T07:46:00.000Z	Black_Phantom	sebsebseb	do you know when they gonna replace this one with the test one?
2009-11-30T07:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Black_Phantom	offtopic, but  replace what with what?
2009-11-30T07:47:00.000Z	Black_Phantom	sebsebseb	#ubuntu-offtopic
2009-11-30T07:49:00.000Z	Black_Phantom	sebsebseb	cool
2009-11-30T07:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Black_Phantom	altough I am wondering why you copied  GamerKnight with the channel name in a message to me
2009-11-30T07:52:00.000Z	Black_Phantom	sebsebseb	i didnt understand, copying what exactly ?
2009-11-30T07:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Black_Phantom	 sebsebseb: #ubuntu-offtopic
2009-11-30T07:54:00.000Z	Black_Phantom	sebsebseb	alright we are already there
2009-11-30T07:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Black_Phantom	ok, but there's some sort of movie off topic now as well
2010-01-23T05:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Black_Phantom	no
2010-01-23T05:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Black_Phantom	something about how Kubuntu only fits on a DVD at the moment or something like that, anyway #ubuntu+1 for Lucid stuff
