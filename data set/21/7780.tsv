2006-10-28T10:49:00.000Z	Bacon		Hey
2006-10-28T10:49:00.000Z	Bacon		I have a few generic questions about ubuntu
2006-10-28T10:50:00.000Z	Bacon		Anyone?
2006-10-28T10:50:00.000Z	Bacon		Great, robo, do I need to partition a section for ubuntu?
2006-10-28T10:50:00.000Z	Bacon		and what separates ubuntu from other linux OSs?
2006-10-28T10:51:00.000Z	Bacon		dough, without losing information
2006-10-28T10:51:00.000Z	Bacon		I wouldn't need to format that specific drive would I?
2006-10-28T10:52:00.000Z	Bacon		Robo: most partition programs (when you separate a harddrive) will clear all the data on the entire drive, so I wont be stuck with this contigency
2006-10-28T10:53:00.000Z	Bacon		Robo: Also, what makes ubuntu so special in a way that it trumpts other Linux OSs?
2006-10-28T10:53:00.000Z	Bacon		I really have no experience in Linux at all
2006-10-28T10:54:00.000Z	redcard	Bacon	Well, I recommend the Ubuntu book.
2006-10-28T10:54:00.000Z	redcard	Bacon	I also recommend an open mind.  Remember that you didn't learn windows overnight..
2006-10-28T10:55:00.000Z	redcard	Bacon	Oh yes :)
2006-10-28T10:57:00.000Z	redcard	Bacon	And ask the forums, and here, and see if you have any Usergroups around you.
2006-10-28T10:58:00.000Z	redcard	Bacon	How much you got currently?
2006-10-28T10:59:00.000Z	redcard	Bacon	IF you are planning on not moving over music, art, etc..  I'd say 10 G would do ya.
2006-10-28T10:59:00.000Z	redcard	Bacon	But.. personally?  GO for it all :)
2006-10-28T10:59:00.000Z	redcard	Bacon	Linux can read NTFS.  Writing.. not so much
2006-10-28T11:00:00.000Z	redcard	Bacon	So if you have your music on your NTFS, you're fine.
2006-10-28T11:01:00.000Z	redcard	Bacon	If you get the livecd, you're good to go.
2006-10-28T11:02:00.000Z	redcard	Bacon	Or.. Nostarch Press has a book called "Ubuntu Linux for Non Geeks"
