2007-08-05T09:39:00.000Z	Gauntlet		thx, I'm stalling @ 7% on the partitioner during install
2007-08-05T09:40:00.000Z	Gauntlet		tried reformatting HD to ext3 to fix, but still no luck
2007-08-05T09:40:00.000Z	Pelo	Gauntlet	 pre partition your hdd before starting the installation program,  make each partition individualy not all at once
2007-08-05T09:43:00.000Z	Pelo	Gauntlet	 you can do well with  5=10  gig for /  (ext3),  2 gig for /swap (linux swap) and the rest for /home  ( ext3)
2007-08-05T09:57:00.000Z	Gauntlet	Pelo	created the partitions using gparted, but still unable to get past 7% on partitioner... anything I missed? partitioned a 8GB ext3, 2GB linux-swap, and a 9GB or so ext3 for the rest of the HD
2007-08-05T09:58:00.000Z	Pelo	Gauntlet	 did you make them one by one ?
2007-08-05T09:58:00.000Z	Pelo	Gauntlet	 I mean make one , apply it , then mak the other , etc
2007-08-05T10:00:00.000Z	Pelo	Gauntlet	 when you say the partitioner doesn'T get pass 7% do you mean the installer ?  because once you'Ve pre partitionned before installing wen you get the the partition stuff,  select manual , skip the partitioner bit go straight to where you specify what partitions to use,  do not reformat the swap or the /home one,  but / will need to be formated,    that shoudl have cut down the on any partitionning to be done
2007-08-05T10:01:00.000Z	Pelo	Gauntlet	use my nick when talking to me please it makes it easier to follow
2007-08-05T10:02:00.000Z	Gauntlet	Pelo	I'll doublecheck, but I don't remember there being a option to manually choose, just a next button
2007-08-05T10:02:00.000Z	Gauntlet	Pelo	I'll check though
2007-08-05T10:03:00.000Z	Pelo	Gauntlet	 when I talk about pre partitionning,  I mean before you ht the install icon,  goto menu > system > admin > gnome partition editor and do it there
2007-08-05T10:05:00.000Z	Gauntlet	Pelo	thats where I did the partitioning, because after selecting the keyboard settings, the partioner part of the install stalls, and I never get to asking how I want to partition
2007-08-05T10:06:00.000Z	Pelo	Gauntlet	 where it asks where you want to intall, yiou get  on a complete hdd,  largest available space and manual,  pck manual
2007-08-05T10:07:00.000Z	Gauntlet	Pelo	I'm not even getting to that part
2007-08-05T10:07:00.000Z	Pelo	Gauntlet	 are you on the live cd now ?
2007-08-05T10:07:00.000Z	Pelo	Gauntlet	do you know how to take a screenshot ?
2007-08-05T10:07:00.000Z	Gauntlet	Pelo	I do in XP, and if its the same, I can
2007-08-05T10:08:00.000Z	Pelo	Gauntlet	ok meet me in #pelo, I'll do a little hand holding and walk you all the way through it
2007-08-05T10:08:00.000Z	Gauntlet	Pelo	and kousotu, thx
