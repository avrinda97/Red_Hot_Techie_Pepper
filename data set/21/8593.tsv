2006-03-09T09:08:00.000Z	Keyframe		I use cream, it's almost there

2006-03-09T09:12:00.000Z	nickrud	Keyframe	a lot of people pay for linux software, just not us low level types :)
2006-03-09T09:28:00.000Z	nickrud	Keyframe	not at all. They coexist as best as possible here.
2006-03-09T09:29:00.000Z	nickrud	Keyframe	and, for kubuntu-desktop, use sudo aptitude install kubuntu-desktop, not apt-get
2006-03-09T09:29:00.000Z	nickrud	Keyframe	at the login screen, look around for
2006-03-09T09:31:00.000Z	nickrud	Keyframe	xubuntu, kubuntu, and any other to-be ubuntu will show up there
2006-03-09T09:31:00.000Z	nickrud	Keyframe	yup
2006-03-09T09:33:00.000Z	nickrud	Keyframe	synaptic is fine, just not apt-get (apt-get makes it very difficult to get rid of unused packages)
2006-03-09T09:37:00.000Z	nickrud	Keyframe	no. that's why we love apt, it WILL not screw up on uninstall (excluding a bug here or there :)
2006-03-09T09:38:00.000Z	Keyframe	nickrud	and synaptic? :)
2006-03-09T09:39:00.000Z	nickrud	Keyframe	synaptic is a fine tool, based on aptitude.
2006-03-09T11:31:00.000Z	nickrud	Keyframe	I use ethereal
