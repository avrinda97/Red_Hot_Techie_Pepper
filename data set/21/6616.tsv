2007-12-08T02:11:00.000Z	sasha_		sorry
2007-12-08T02:11:00.000Z	crdlb	sasha_	ugh once you use the ati installer, it's nearly impossible to go back to the ubuntu packages
2007-12-08T02:13:00.000Z	crdlb	sasha_	oh, you're in Xgl
2007-12-08T02:14:00.000Z	crdlb	sasha_	display :1.0 means that you've installed the xserver-xgl package, in which you do not get direct rendering, but compiz still works
2007-12-08T02:15:00.000Z	crdlb	sasha_	get rid of Xgl
2007-12-08T02:15:00.000Z	crdlb	sasha_	but then you won't be able to use compiz
2007-12-08T02:19:00.000Z	crdlb	sasha_	that's a fglrx bug :)
2007-12-08T02:21:00.000Z	crdlb	sasha_	beryl is dead
2007-12-08T02:22:00.000Z	crdlb	sasha_	it has been replaced by compiz fusion, which is installed by default on ubuntu
2007-12-08T02:23:00.000Z	crdlb	sasha_	you're using kubuntu, not ubuntu
2007-12-08T02:27:00.000Z	crdlb	sasha_	yes, but you don't have to worry about it really. compiz fusion is a set of addons to compiz
2007-12-08T02:54:00.000Z	crdlb	sasha_	no, you don't have "direct rendering" :)
