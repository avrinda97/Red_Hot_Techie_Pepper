2005-04-20T16:08:00.000Z	dcraven	newuser	open up the file /etc/X11/xorg.conf and paste the Section "Screen" section into www.pastebin.com.
2005-04-20T16:16:00.000Z	dcraven	newuser	how are you trying to change the resolution?
2005-04-20T16:17:00.000Z	dcraven	newuser	try Ctrl-Alt-KP_Plus
2005-04-20T16:17:00.000Z	dcraven	newuser	or KP_Minus
2005-04-20T16:18:00.000Z	dcraven	newuser	could you paste the contents of your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file at www.pastebin.com?

2005-04-20T16:22:00.000Z	dcraven	newuser	no manual changes?
2005-04-20T16:23:00.000Z	dcraven	newuser	is this a laptop?

2005-04-20T16:25:00.000Z	dcraven	newuser	backup that file like this "cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.orig", then change the line marked #108 at pastebin to include only resolution "1024x768". Remove the rest.
2005-04-20T16:26:00.000Z	dcraven	newuser	if this doesn't work, then copying the old file back (ie "cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf.orig /etc/X11/xorg.conf") will get you back to the same state you are in.
2005-04-20T16:27:00.000Z	dcraven	newuser	I gotto go eat. I'll be back.
2005-04-20T16:27:00.000Z	dcraven	newuser	okay, sorry :)
