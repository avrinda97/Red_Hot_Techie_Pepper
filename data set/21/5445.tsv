2008-02-09T10:27:00.000Z	Creationist		Does anyone know how I can apply a custom album art cover to an entire album of .MP3 files?  Amarok only lets you use Amazon or custom pictures for individual files.
2008-02-09T10:27:00.000Z	dman	Creationist	by default Amarok applies the album art to all songs in that album...
2008-02-09T10:28:00.000Z	Creationist	dman	It only does that if you use Amazon to find the art.  If you want to set a custom cover, you can only do that one file at a time.
2008-02-09T10:28:00.000Z	dman	Creationist	I've done it with a custom cover. it was for an album w/ 500 songs. all have it now.
2008-02-09T10:29:00.000Z	Creationist	dman	 How did you do that?  I can't change the art when I have more than one file selected.
2008-02-09T10:29:00.000Z	dman	Creationist	the same way as usual. select one track and change its album art. it should automatically apply to allt he others
2008-02-09T10:30:00.000Z	Creationist	dman	Yeah, I would have assumed so too... but it's only applying it to that one file, not the entire album.
2008-02-09T10:30:00.000Z	dman	Creationist	odd. is the album naem the same?
2008-02-09T10:31:00.000Z	Creationist	dman	yes, identical.... all the songs are listed under the same album in Amarok too
2008-02-09T10:31:00.000Z	dman	Creationist	that is weird...
2008-02-09T10:32:00.000Z	dman	Creationist	maybe you messing with it before screwed something up . your solution might just be to do it manually fo that album.
2008-02-09T10:34:00.000Z	dman	Creationist	i just did it to experiment. worked fine.
2008-02-09T10:35:00.000Z	Creationist	dman	Well, that's the beauty of Linux... just because it works for 50 other people, doesn't mean it will for the other 50 ;)
2008-02-09T10:36:00.000Z	dman	Creationist	true enough. do yuo have an album art image in the folder. or more than one?
2008-02-09T10:36:00.000Z	Creationist	dman	No, I have the album art images in separate folders and I'm trying to apply them to the albums in my collection.... not working.
2008-02-09T10:37:00.000Z	dman	Creationist	i did put the album art in the same folder as the files. maybe that helps?
2008-02-09T10:37:00.000Z	Creationist	dman	Do you have to name it something specific?
2008-02-09T10:38:00.000Z	dman	Creationist	not that i know of. mine was just random letters.
2008-02-09T10:38:00.000Z	Creationist	dman	I want the art to be embedded in the MP3, though, so when I tranfer it to my mp3 player, it works well.
2008-02-09T10:38:00.000Z	Creationist	dman	Hmm... even fetching a cover from Amazon doesn't apply it to the entire album.
2008-02-09T10:39:00.000Z	dman	Creationist	i'm not sure if Amarok does that. i think so, tho. You should try #amarok for experts
