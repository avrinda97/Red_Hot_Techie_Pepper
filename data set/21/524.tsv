2011-10-24T10:03:00.000Z	hrolf		Do I need to install something to get my webcam running (I'm on Ubuntu 11.10) ?
2011-10-24T10:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hrolf	try cheese first
2011-10-24T10:04:00.000Z	hrolf	ActionParsnip	Is cheese installed by default with Ubuntu 11.10?
2011-10-24T10:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hrolf	if it works in cheese you are golden
2011-10-24T10:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hrolf	not sure but its easily installed
2011-10-24T10:06:00.000Z	hrolf	ActionParsnip	I don't get it, when I was installing Ubuntu. I got the option to take a picture and set it as my identity. If Ubuntu can detect my webcam (and use it) why do I need to install software? So there must be something already installed. Anyone knows?
2011-10-24T10:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hrolf	its a simple test. It can be equally easily uninstalled. It may be in a default install too. Instead of typing here, why are you not exploring my suggestion?
2011-10-24T10:09:00.000Z	hrolf	ActionParsnip	Alright, sorry :) I should go and check it out.
2011-12-28T22:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hrolf	does what you use require sun java?
2011-12-28T22:39:00.000Z	hrolf	ActionParsnip	How do I know if it requires sun java?
2011-12-28T22:39:00.000Z	hrolf	ActionParsnip	I'm running the TopCoder.com applet
2011-12-28T22:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hrolf	it may state on the developer site, or you can ask them
2011-12-28T22:55:00.000Z	hrolf	ActionParsnip	I did this i.e. ran it through the command line and it opened up (with OpenJDK) so I don't think it is because it requires Sun Java. Can you seem to be able to spot any issues now?
2011-12-28T22:55:00.000Z	hrolf	ActionParsnip	http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/debian-26/java-doesnt-work-in-my-browser-910860/
2011-12-28T22:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hrolf	does the last command work ok for you?
2011-12-28T22:56:00.000Z	hrolf	ActionParsnip	Yes.
2011-12-28T22:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hrolf	sweet
2011-12-28T22:57:00.000Z	hrolf	ActionParsnip	But when I right click -> open with -> Iced tea web start 6 it, tries to download the .jar file and then gets stuck at 6% and after a while reports the error I pasted earlier.
2011-12-28T22:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hrolf	you could make a bash script, or alias to run that command easier
2011-12-28T22:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hrolf	or make a copy of the launcher for Iced tea in /usr/share/applications     and change the Exec= line to run that
2011-12-28T23:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hrolf	right click it maybe...
