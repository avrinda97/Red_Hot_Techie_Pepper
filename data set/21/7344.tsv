2006-12-21T09:08:00.000Z	SilentDis	h0ndaracer2	 if you have a .deb package that's newer than the one currently installed on your machine, you should be able to just dbl click it, and click install :)

2006-12-21T09:12:00.000Z	SilentDis	h0ndaracer2	 that package you pulled from the firefox website is not a debian package.  it's the application itself.  you can run firefox-bin from the folder you extracted, but other than that, there's no way to 'install' on Ubuntu what you downloaded.  the only way to 'install' it is to use the backports ubotu mentioned :)
