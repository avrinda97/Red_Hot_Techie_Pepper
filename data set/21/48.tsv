2012-11-08T08:41:00.000Z	Febul		Why is my httpd.conf file in /etc/apache2 empty?
2012-11-08T08:41:00.000Z	[twisti]	Febul	the data is spread over other files
2012-11-08T08:42:00.000Z	[twisti]	Febul	most of it is in apache2.conf, some in conf.d and in the sites/mods available folders
2012-11-08T08:42:00.000Z	[twisti]	Febul	are you looking for anything in particular ?
2012-11-08T08:42:00.000Z	Febul	[twisti]	Where is the configuration for modules loaded? I would like to load mod wsgi.
2012-11-08T08:43:00.000Z	[twisti]	Febul	for starters, you shouldnt load modules by changing config files
2012-11-08T08:44:00.000Z	Febul	[twisti]	Well I've installed mod-wsgi from the APT. libapache2-mod-wsgi, is that enough?
2012-11-08T08:44:00.000Z	[twisti]	Febul	i dont see that particular mod, you may have to google how to use that in ubuntu, oh yeah, or that
2012-11-08T08:44:00.000Z	[twisti]		then do
2012-11-08T08:44:00.000Z	[twisti]		sudo a2enmod wsgi
2012-11-08T08:44:00.000Z	[twisti]		or whatever its called
2012-11-08T08:44:00.000Z	Febul	[twisti]	Have you ever used mod_wsgi?
2012-11-08T08:44:00.000Z	[twisti]		you can check /etc/apache2/mods-available
2012-11-08T08:45:00.000Z	[twisti]		i have not, which is why i cant tell you about it specifically, only about how youre supposed to load mods in general
2012-11-08T08:45:00.000Z	Febul	[twisti]	It says that it's loaded, thanks.
2012-11-08T08:46:00.000Z	Febul		If anyone here has ever used mod_wsgi/flask, some guided assistance would be greatly appreciated :)
2012-11-08T08:46:00.000Z	[twisti]	Febul	dont forget that you might have to restart apache2
2012-11-08T08:47:00.000Z	Febul	[twisti]	Thanks :)
2012-11-08T08:47:00.000Z	Febul	[twisti]	How do I restart from the command line again?
2012-11-08T08:47:00.000Z	[twisti]		sudo service apache2 restart
2012-11-08T08:48:00.000Z	Febul	[twisti]	Thaks
