2008-08-04T08:47:00.000Z	thiefness		I can't seem to find any easycam2 packages or repositories for gutsy, can anyone link me or find some other way to help me out? ;x
2008-08-04T08:48:00.000Z	Stormx2	thiefness	check https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EasyCam
2008-08-04T08:49:00.000Z	thiefness	Stormx2	the only repo it gives is this: deb http://blognux.free.fr/ubuntu hardy main can i use that in gutsy?
2008-08-04T08:50:00.000Z	Stormx2	thiefness	I doubt it. It might be in backports, I suppose. You could always upgrade to hardy?
2008-08-04T08:51:00.000Z	thiefness	Stormx2	 My wireless card doesn't work correctly in hardy, I just downgraded =\
2008-08-04T08:51:00.000Z	Stormx2	thiefness	Oh man, that sucks.
2008-08-04T08:52:00.000Z	Stormx2	thiefness	do some googling too. Someone might have built a gutsy version. You could always install from source, too.
2008-08-04T09:10:00.000Z	Stormx2	thiefness	just grab a source package http://blognux.free.fr/ubuntu/dists/hardy/main/source/ and compile?
2008-08-04T09:12:00.000Z	thiefness	Stormx2	would compiling a hardy package on gutsy work...?
2008-08-04T09:12:00.000Z	Stormx2	thiefness	you're compiling the source, not the package itself.
2008-08-04T09:12:00.000Z	Stormx2	thiefness	did you check backprots like I suggested/
2008-08-04T09:17:00.000Z	thiefness	Stormx2	it doesn't actually have any make files or anything o_0
2008-08-04T09:18:00.000Z	Stormx2	thiefness	lemme have a look, one tik.
2008-08-04T09:19:00.000Z	Stormx2	thiefness	are you SURE this is the only way you can install your cam?
2008-08-04T09:19:00.000Z	thiefness	Stormx2	nope, not even sure it would work, but supposedly it's generally the easiest option if it works.. :P
2008-08-04T09:20:00.000Z	thiefness	Stormx2	 dynex webcam, don't know the make
2008-08-04T09:20:00.000Z	Stormx2	thiefness	it doesn't say anywhere? There's not a sticker on the bottom?

2008-08-04T09:22:00.000Z	thiefness	Stormx2	lsusb gives this: Bus 002 Device 004: ID 05a9:8519 OmniVision Technologies, Inc.
2008-08-04T09:35:00.000Z	Stormx2	thiefness	check your home directory?
