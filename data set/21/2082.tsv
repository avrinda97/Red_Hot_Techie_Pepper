2011-04-22T07:23:00.000Z	Rehan	rileyp	could you assist me?
2011-04-22T07:24:00.000Z	rileyp	Rehan	type sudo fdisk -l this will list your partitions
2011-04-22T07:26:00.000Z	Rehan	rileyp	thank you, I have /dev/sda1 which is win7 system reserve, i have /dev/sda2 which is win7 system partition, i have /dev/sda3 which is extended and /dev/sda5 which is ubuntu. When I'm installing grub2, it gives me option of either /dev/sda or /dev/sda5.
2011-04-22T07:27:00.000Z	Rehan	rileyp	after updating ubuntu thru update manager my Windows no longer boots and gives BOOTMGR is missing.  What could I do to fix that?
2011-04-22T07:27:00.000Z	rileyp	Rehan	you may need to run sudo update-grup for windows to be added to your grub list
2011-04-22T07:28:00.000Z	Rehan	rileyp	windows was added automatically
2011-04-22T07:28:00.000Z	Rehan	rileyp	the problem is when i go into windows from grub2 it says the bootmgr is missing now. Not sure why a simple ubuntu update caused that to happen
2011-04-22T07:29:00.000Z	Rehan	rileyp	yep, this is my boot info summary: http://pastebin.com/CigFER4z
2011-04-22T07:30:00.000Z	rileyp	Rehan	to fix this you may need to start windows and go to a command line then type fixboot
2011-04-22T07:31:00.000Z	rileyp	Rehan	 I think what has happened is soem of the winowds boot files have been overwritten by ytour new grub install
2011-04-22T07:32:00.000Z	Rehan	rileyp	i see, when i tried my win7 recovery DVD it found no booting problems, i suppose i can try it again because when i first tried it win7 was simply missing from grub2, now it shows the bootmgr is missing error
2011-04-22T07:33:00.000Z	Rehan	rileyp	will this happen everytime i install a kernel upgrade if my grub is on the MBR instead of the ubuntu partition?
2011-04-22T07:36:00.000Z	rileyp	Rehan	everytime one does a kernel upgrade grub is edited and it it asks where to install it you should write it down somewhere so you know the answer.
2011-04-22T08:37:00.000Z	Rehan	rileyp	I got win7 working again with easyBCD bootloader
2011-04-22T08:39:00.000Z	Rehan	rileyp	now when i boot i get the easyBCD boot menu and if I hit windows, it loads fine. However if I load ubuntu and hold down SHIFT menu to get grub, and choose Windows, I still get the bootmgr is missing error
2011-04-22T08:43:00.000Z	Rehan	rileyp	still around?
