2006-05-27T16:10:00.000Z	nelisa	AlwaysIcey	how to get more res enabled?
2006-05-27T16:08:00.000Z	AlwaysIcey	nelisa	I'll look into the resolutions right now.
2006-05-27T16:10:00.000Z	AlwaysIcey	nelisa	Click on System > Preferences > Screen Resolutions, and change it there.
2006-05-27T16:10:00.000Z	nelisa	AlwaysIcey	there's only a resolution there, that's way to high for my miopia
2006-05-27T16:11:00.000Z	nelisa	AlwaysIcey	thanks
2006-05-27T16:12:00.000Z	AlwaysIcey	nelisa	Try clicking on the arrows next to the resolution.  Tell me if any more options are there.
2006-05-27T16:12:00.000Z	nelisa	AlwaysIcey	negative
2006-05-27T16:12:00.000Z	nelisa	AlwaysIcey	60 Hx only
2006-05-27T16:13:00.000Z	nelisa	AlwaysIcey	Resolution 1280x1024
2006-05-27T16:15:00.000Z	nelisa	AlwaysIcey	how do I poll my hardware for more res options?
2006-05-27T16:16:00.000Z	AlwaysIcey	nelisa	possibly in System > Administration > Device Manager.
2006-05-27T16:19:00.000Z	nelisa	AlwaysIcey	what I'm looking for??
2006-05-27T16:20:00.000Z	AlwaysIcey	nelisa	in Device Manager, you'll be looking for the Display Adapter or something similar to that.
2006-05-27T16:24:00.000Z	nelisa	AlwaysIcey	only video related thing is 82830 CGC
2006-05-27T16:25:00.000Z	nelisa	AlwaysIcey	they sent me back to #ubuntu
2006-05-27T16:32:00.000Z	AlwaysIcey	nelisa	I may have a workaround for you, although it's not a solution.
2006-05-27T16:33:00.000Z	AlwaysIcey	nelisa	If you go into System > Preferences > Assistive Technology Support, you can enable the magnifier and a few other options.  If nothing else, that will help until you get a solution.
2006-05-27T16:37:00.000Z	nelisa	AlwaysIcey	upping the fonts helped loads
2006-05-27T16:49:00.000Z	nelisa	AlwaysIcey	bunch of unknown devices in dev manager, where to look at first?
