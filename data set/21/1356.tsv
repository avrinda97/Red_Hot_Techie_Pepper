2011-01-12T21:29:00.000Z	mbeierl		how do I turn off the touchpad on a Dell E6410 if it's "not a synaptics device".  Syndaemon won't work for it.
2011-01-12T21:29:00.000Z	KM0201	mbeierl	sys/pref/mouse/touchpad tab   disable it.
2011-01-12T21:30:00.000Z	mbeierl	KM0201	Nope.  there's nothing there about the touchpad
2011-01-12T21:30:00.000Z	KM0201	mbeierl	strange, there is for me... do you have a keyboard shortcut to disable it?.. mine is shift + f7
2011-01-12T21:30:00.000Z	mbeierl	KM0201	just general and accessibility.  That's what's got me so confused and frustrated
2011-01-12T21:31:00.000Z	mbeierl	KM0201	Nope.  Not even that. :(
2011-01-12T21:32:00.000Z	KM0201	mbeierl	well what happened when you installed gsynaptics?
2011-01-12T21:34:00.000Z	mbeierl	KM0201	it does not detect the touch pad.  it only gives me my built in mouse and my external mouse
2011-02-01T20:09:00.000Z	KM0201	mbeierl	i thought the server install cd's, were basically alt cd's?
2011-02-01T20:12:00.000Z	mbeierl	KM0201	so, according to the info bot, the alt is more than just server cd...  good to get confirmation on that :)
2011-02-01T20:12:00.000Z	KM0201	mbeierl	i've used the alt. cd lots of times, its a desktop cd.. i'm not aware of it installing a server.. i dunno.. guess he'll find out.
2011-02-01T20:13:00.000Z	mbeierl	KM0201	sorry - I did not know he was looking to install the server.  I assumed desktop .. bad for me
2011-02-01T20:13:00.000Z	KM0201	mbeierl	yeah, that was the whole point of the discussion i think.
2011-02-01T20:14:00.000Z	mbeierl	KM0201	and he left... I just re-read his post .  I misunderstood he was trying to install on a "server" not "server cd".  dangit.  I hope he comes back and I can clarify
2011-05-12T22:18:00.000Z	KM0201	mbeierl	my experience, LTS is no more stable/unstable, than a normal release... i think LTS is over rated
2011-05-12T22:18:00.000Z	mbeierl	KM0201	but going from LTS to a non-LTS in the first week of release can be risky... is all I'm saying
2011-05-12T22:19:00.000Z	KM0201	mbeierl	i disagree.. completely actually.
2011-05-12T22:21:00.000Z	mbeierl	KM0201	it's to each their own degree of risk tolerance.  For example, I don't think 10.04 LTS would work any better on bleeding edge hardware then 11.04, but here we have a case where a working system did become unstable after the upgrade.
2011-05-12T22:26:00.000Z	KM0201	mbeierl	lts, doesn't really have anything at all to do w/ stability, but w/ support... i've had LTS releases give me just as many problems as non-lts...
2012-05-10T20:09:00.000Z	mbeierl	KM0201	can evince be set to open a la ole inside the browser?
2012-05-10T20:09:00.000Z	mbeierl	KM0201	ditto here.
