2010-10-13T02:06:00.000Z	rypervenche		I'm compiling for the first time. I am following the guide here, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingEasyHowTo, but I have a question. Once I finish compiling do I still need the folder I used to compile it in or can I delete it? (Here they use /usr/local/src)
2010-10-13T02:07:00.000Z	edbian	rypervenche	If you have the binary files you don't need the actual source code any more.  Make sure you don't delete some files you didn't compile yet though!
2010-10-13T02:07:00.000Z	rypervenche	edbian	I'm installing bitfighter and it said on the website that I have to compile it for Linux.
2010-10-13T02:08:00.000Z	edbian	rypervenche	Once it's compile you don't need the source code any more.
2010-11-01T04:11:00.000Z	edbian	rypervenche	By ending the command with a &  (i.e. firefox&)
2010-11-01T04:13:00.000Z	rypervenche	edbian	when I close my terminal it closes my program as well
2010-11-01T04:13:00.000Z	edbian	rypervenche	did you type a &
2010-11-01T04:14:00.000Z	rypervenche	edbian	I did. It allows me to do other things with the terminal, but once I close the terminal, the program closes as well.
2010-11-01T04:26:00.000Z	rypervenche	edbian	did you see my problem? (can't repost, on iPhone)
2010-11-01T04:27:00.000Z	edbian	rypervenche	About the app closing when you close the panel?
2010-11-01T04:28:00.000Z	rypervenche	edbian	yeah, I posted a rather long description about it.
2010-11-01T04:28:00.000Z	edbian	rypervenche	use disown

2011-03-27T08:55:00.000Z	edbian	rypervenche	yes
2011-03-27T08:55:00.000Z	edbian	rypervenche	That is exactly what you should do.
2011-08-14T07:22:00.000Z	rypervenche	edbian	Thumbs up to you good sir!

2011-09-16T03:19:00.000Z	rypervenche	edbian	I think it is easier to set up a repo :P Just add to /etc/apt/sources.list ^^
2011-09-16T03:20:00.000Z	edbian	rypervenche	You can add PPA's to /etc/apt/sources.list no?
2011-09-16T03:22:00.000Z	rypervenche	edbian	I always used apt-something...can't remember. Basically they're the same thing though.
