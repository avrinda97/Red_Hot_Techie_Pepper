2011-05-06T13:11:00.000Z	ThinkingDragon		Hi, i'm on a clean install of Ubuntu 11.04, installed the Nvidia drivers already. Nvidia-Settings reports temperature of 80F, and using ANY app raises it to 100F, I can barely do anything before it shuts down from overheating, suggestions anyone?
2011-05-06T13:13:00.000Z	luite	ThinkingDragon	I had the same problem and "solved" it by manually limiting the clock speed of the gpu to the lowest setting. By the way, did you mean 100C, because 100 Fahrenheit is quite cool for a GPU :)
2011-05-06T13:15:00.000Z	ThinkingDragon	luite	yeah i meant C. how do i limit the clock speed... i read on the forums about nvclock, but when i try it says my card is not supported (Nvidia GeForce 210)
2011-05-06T13:18:00.000Z	luite	ThinkingDragon	one moment, I'll check my config file. a disadvantage is that the gpu is then really locked to that speed, it will not dynamically increase the frequency anymore. this is probably not a problem with unity or the desktop, but will limit performance in games
2011-05-06T13:21:00.000Z	luite	ThinkingDragon	this is the relevant section of my xorg.conf, it works with the nvidia binary driver: http://hpaste.org/46421/etcx11xorgconf
2011-05-06T13:22:00.000Z	ThinkingDragon	luite	thanks i'll give it a try...
2011-05-06T13:23:00.000Z	luite	ThinkingDragon	is it a laptop by the way?
2011-05-06T13:25:00.000Z	ThinkingDragon	luite	no, its a small desktop that i use as a HTPC
2011-05-06T13:26:00.000Z	ThinkingDragon	luite	btw, the overheating never happened when windows was installed, so it cant be a hardware problem
2011-05-06T13:27:00.000Z	luite	ThinkingDragon	well it could still be. the windows 7 aero desktop doesn't tax the gpu as much as the ubuntu unity desktop in my experience
2011-05-06T13:28:00.000Z	ThinkingDragon	luite	i tried unity, ubuntu classic, ubuntu classic (safe mode), etc. it happans always
2011-05-06T13:29:00.000Z	luite	ThinkingDragon	hmm, it might be a driver problem with the fan controller or something
2011-05-06T13:30:00.000Z	luite	ThinkingDragon	does it actually have a fan?
2011-05-06T13:31:00.000Z	ThinkingDragon	luite	i also think its something to do with the drivers... so i tried uninstalling the one from Ubuntu's repositories, and installing the ones from the PPA rep mentioned in the BinaryDriverHowto help page
2011-05-06T13:31:00.000Z	ThinkingDragon	luite	yes it does have a fan
2011-05-06T13:33:00.000Z	luite	ThinkingDragon	oh by the way, the xorg.conf settings I mentioned only work if your gpu has multiple performance levels. you can check in nvidia-settings under GPU 0 / PowerMizer
2011-05-06T13:33:00.000Z	luite	ThinkingDragon	my 8600m-gt (laptop) has 3 levels, but my geforce 9400 on-board (htpc) only has one
2011-05-06T13:35:00.000Z	ThinkingDragon	luite	in Nvidia-Settings it doesnt say how many performance levels it has... but it says its set to "Performance Level 0" i'll try it anyway and see how it goes
2011-05-06T13:36:00.000Z	luite	ThinkingDragon	bah that's what my htpc has too. it still does some dynamic clocking, but I have no idea how this config influences this
2011-05-06T13:36:00.000Z	luite	ThinkingDragon	my laptop also has performance level 1 and 2, the config manually locks it to 0
2011-05-06T13:37:00.000Z	ThinkingDragon	luite	ok, thanks for all the info. i'm going to go try it now
