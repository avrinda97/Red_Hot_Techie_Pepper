2009-10-06T03:33:00.000Z	dartagnan_		how come I cant simply write vista chainloader as 0 for default booting????
2009-10-06T03:33:00.000Z	dartagnan_		I dont see the point with grub
2009-10-06T03:33:00.000Z	dartagnan_		when i had ubuntu into windows xp windows was the first to boot by default
2009-10-06T03:34:00.000Z	dartagnan_		thats not logical
2009-10-06T03:34:00.000Z	dartagnan_		how could grub be so complicated for nothing
2009-10-06T03:34:00.000Z	dartagnan_		I know
2009-10-06T03:35:00.000Z	dartagnan_		but why cant I choose vista as default for booting ?
2009-10-06T03:35:00.000Z	dartagnan_		its not logical
2009-10-06T03:35:00.000Z	dartagnan_		because I have kids on the pc, would be simpler this way
2009-10-06T03:37:00.000Z	dartagnan_		I cange the + 1 of vista for 0???
2009-10-06T03:37:00.000Z	ikonia	dartagnan_	can you see the line "Default" in /boot/grub/menu.lst ?
2009-10-06T03:38:00.000Z	ikonia	dartagnan_	stop - no-one is laughing at you
2009-10-06T03:38:00.000Z	ikonia	dartagnan_	can you see the line "default" in /boot/grub/menu.lst
2009-10-06T03:39:00.000Z	ikonia	dartagnan_	can you pastebin /boot/grub/menu.lst please ?
2009-10-06T03:39:00.000Z	ikonia	dartagnan_	no
2009-10-06T03:40:00.000Z	ikonia	dartagnan_	you need to count the menu items (just titles) until you get to vista, start at 0 and then count to your vista entry, that is the number you want
2009-10-06T03:40:00.000Z	ikonia	dartagnan_	eg: if vista is the 4th title in the list, you want to set it to 3
2009-10-06T03:43:00.000Z	ikonia	dartagnan_	the number doesn't matter
2009-10-06T03:43:00.000Z	ikonia	dartagnan_	it's just a menu list identifier
2009-10-06T03:43:00.000Z	ikonia	dartagnan_	change the number to the menu list number of vista, eg: 4th entry, = change it to 3
2009-10-06T03:44:00.000Z	ikonia	dartagnan_	pardon ?
