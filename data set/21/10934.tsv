2004-10-28T06:33:00.000Z	spikeb		hmmm
2004-10-28T06:33:00.000Z	spikeb		im still debating on whether to use ubuntu or sarge, myself.
2004-10-28T06:34:00.000Z	crimsun	spikeb	the selling point for me would be security updates for ubuntu.
2004-10-28T06:34:00.000Z	crimsun	spikeb	not to mention that as a desktop platform, ubuntu is arguably easier to configure
2004-10-28T06:35:00.000Z	spikeb	crimsun	i'm fine in either, so i'm just pondering
2004-10-28T06:35:00.000Z	crimsun	spikeb	sure thing.
2004-10-28T07:46:00.000Z	crimsun	spikeb	would you walk overflow through it please?
2004-10-28T07:46:00.000Z	spikeb	crimsun	mine worked out of the box - no configuring neccessary
2004-12-30T12:42:00.000Z	crimsun	spikeb	ubuntu hoary and debian sid are remarkably close (except for glib/gtk/pango/atk & gnome -related packages)
2004-12-30T12:42:00.000Z	spikeb	crimsun	aye
2005-01-08T11:55:00.000Z	spikeb	crimsun	mp4 you mean?
2005-01-08T11:55:00.000Z	crimsun	spikeb	iTune's DRMed mp4s.
2005-01-08T11:55:00.000Z	spikeb	crimsun	you can
2005-01-09T06:06:00.000Z	crimsun	spikeb	probably need -np, too :P
2005-01-13T10:13:00.000Z	crimsun	spikeb	very slowly.
2005-01-13T10:13:00.000Z	spikeb	crimsun	uh oh
2005-01-13T10:13:00.000Z	spikeb	crimsun	how come?
2005-01-13T10:14:00.000Z	crimsun	spikeb	well, more developers would help...
2005-01-13T10:14:00.000Z	spikeb	crimsun	yeah that'll hurt any open project
2005-01-13T10:14:00.000Z	spikeb	crimsun	is it unlikely to be usable by hoary release?
2006-05-26T13:44:00.000Z	crimsun	spikeb	about as stable as its users.
