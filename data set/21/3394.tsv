2011-03-06T15:06:00.000Z	flexd		Uh, i just installed ubuntu yesterday and the color scheme seems a bit.. off
2011-03-06T15:06:00.000Z	flexd		It's too dark/odd? Not sure if it's just displaying wrong
2011-03-06T15:07:00.000Z	Fjodor	flexd	Have a look in System -> Preferences -> Appearance
2011-03-06T15:07:00.000Z	flexd	Fjodor	changing between the themes doesn't really make a difference, still looks odd
2011-03-06T15:07:00.000Z	Fjodor	flexd	Lets you select other themes. If they seem odd as well, you are more sure that there is an actual display problem
2011-03-06T15:08:00.000Z	Fjodor	flexd	Ah, ok
2011-03-06T15:08:00.000Z	Fjodor	flexd	Can you describe "odd"?
2011-03-06T15:08:00.000Z	flexd	Fjodor	If i can take a screenshot, yes.
2011-03-06T15:09:00.000Z	Fjodor	flexd	I think that it may very well look normal on other machines
2011-03-06T15:09:00.000Z	flexd	Fjodor	yeah.
2011-03-06T15:10:00.000Z	Fjodor	flexd	Which drivers? Proprietary or open source?
2011-03-06T15:11:00.000Z	flexd	Fjodor	Just tried resetting my monitor and it got even odder
2011-03-06T15:11:00.000Z	Fjodor	flexd	have you tried the open source ones?
2011-03-06T15:11:00.000Z	flexd	Fjodor	No, i didn't know they existed.. and won't that leave me without hardware acceleration ?
2011-03-06T15:12:00.000Z	Fjodor	flexd	They work very well on my laptop and since ATI has opened the specs, you *do* get accell :-)
2011-03-06T15:18:00.000Z	Fjodor	flexd	In other words, I recommend that you try out the open source drivers, if for nothing else, to see if they have the same problem. If so, you might have a hardware problem on your hands...
2011-03-06T15:20:00.000Z	flexd	Fjodor	Nonsense, it worked perfectly fine in windows (and still does) when i reboot.
2011-03-06T15:21:00.000Z	Fjodor	flexd	Well, then set it right on that monitor?
2011-03-06T15:21:00.000Z	flexd	Fjodor	trying :)
2011-03-06T15:22:00.000Z	Fjodor	flexd	My concern is, though, that since you say that it works fine in Windows, that leaves us with the drivers as the likely culprit
2011-03-06T15:41:00.000Z	Fjodor	flexd	Happy to help, if it was only just a little. I still don't think it would hurt to use the opens source drivers, though ;-)
