2009-05-17T16:21:00.000Z	bloupotlood		Hi guys
2009-05-17T16:22:00.000Z	bloupotlood		I try to SSH into my laptop via the ethernet connection, but it states Connection Refused.
2009-05-17T16:23:00.000Z	bloupotlood		How would you transfer files between two Jaunty machines via ethernet?
2009-05-17T16:23:00.000Z	Slart	bloupotlood	ftp might be the easiest..
2009-05-17T16:23:00.000Z	bloupotlood	Slart	cool man, how do you go abouts doing that in FTP?
2009-05-17T16:24:00.000Z	Slart	bloupotlood	install an ftp-server on one machine.. and a client on the other
2009-05-17T16:24:00.000Z	Slart	bloupotlood	rsync is a nice choice too.. might be better than ftp
2009-05-17T16:24:00.000Z	bloupotlood	Slart	sweet dude.
2009-05-17T16:26:00.000Z	bloupotlood	Slart	ok, say my laptop is 192.168.1.100, and my desktop is 192.168.1.101, how would i rsync files from the laptop to the desktop?
2009-05-17T16:27:00.000Z	Slart	bloupotlood	see ozzmosis answer.. exchange remotehost for 192.168.1.101 and run the command on 192.168.1.100
2009-05-17T16:38:00.000Z	Slart	bloupotlood	first consider if you really need to install from source.. do that a couple of times.. then read the README file or the INSTALL file that usually comes in the tar-file
2009-05-17T16:38:00.000Z	bloupotlood	Slart	trying to install Samba mate.
2009-05-17T16:38:00.000Z	Slart	bloupotlood	the method isn't the same for all source packages.. usually it's "./configure" "make" "sudo make install" but sometimes it's different
2009-05-17T16:38:00.000Z	bloupotlood	Slart	ah ok
2009-05-17T16:39:00.000Z	Slart	bloupotlood	why not download a deb-package then? packages.ubuntu.com might be able to help
2009-05-17T16:39:00.000Z	Slart	bloupotlood	a deb-package is like a install file.. it's designed for ubuntu, will create menu's, setup stuff etc etc.. no need for compiling
2009-05-17T16:41:00.000Z	bloupotlood	Slart	k will do.
2009-05-18T22:34:00.000Z	Slart	bloupotlood	check the medibuntu repository.. I think they have a webpage where you can get packages
2009-05-18T22:34:00.000Z	bloupotlood	Slart	cool beans, thanks dude.
2009-05-18T22:35:00.000Z	Slart	bloupotlood	you can also use synaptic to generate downloading-scripts.. you can then run those on a windows machine using wget
2009-05-18T22:35:00.000Z	Slart	bloupotlood	but it might not work unless the ubuntu machine has some up to date package lists..
