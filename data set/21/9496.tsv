2006-12-10T06:23:00.000Z	shingoki		how can I stop different users from being able to see each other's files?
2006-12-10T06:24:00.000Z	Flannel	shingoki	they usually cant.  Where are you having troubles?
2006-12-10T06:24:00.000Z	shingoki	Flannel	by "see" I mean list directories, etc.
2006-12-10T06:25:00.000Z	shingoki	Flannel	although in this case, I can read another user's files as well
2006-12-10T06:26:00.000Z	shingoki	Flannel	any idea how to stop that?
2006-12-10T06:26:00.000Z	Flannel	shingoki	they mustve screwed up their own permissions.  Since home folders are set to not be able to be world readable
2006-12-10T06:26:00.000Z	shingoki	Flannel	I just created this new user with the tool thingy
2006-12-10T06:27:00.000Z	shingoki	Flannel	how would I create a new user with its files not visible by other users?
2006-12-10T06:27:00.000Z	Flannel	shingoki	right, and what are the perms for his home dir? (ls -l /home/)
2006-12-10T06:28:00.000Z	shingoki	Flannel	drwxr-xr-x
2006-12-10T06:30:00.000Z	shingoki	Flannel	ah I see what you mean - ok I did a recursive chmod to get rid of permissions for "a" and "o" but not "x", presumably that is ok?
2006-12-10T06:30:00.000Z	Flannel	shingoki	just remove the read and execute bits for others on that
2006-12-10T06:30:00.000Z	Flannel	shingoki	group should be ok to leave
2006-12-10T06:30:00.000Z	shingoki	Flannel	cool, thanks
2006-12-10T06:31:00.000Z	Flannel	shingoki	and, recursive wasn't what you wanted.  Just the /home/username/
2006-12-10T06:31:00.000Z	shingoki	Flannel	yeah I just realised that
2006-12-10T06:31:00.000Z	shingoki	Flannel	ah well
2006-12-10T06:33:00.000Z	shingoki	Flannel	heh I am breaking stuff merrily now - I deleted the user and his home directory, then recreated user, and his home directory wasn't created
2006-12-10T06:36:00.000Z	shingoki	Flannel	ok I think I've fixed it, thanks, cya :)
2008-09-20T14:12:00.000Z	Flannel	shingoki	#ubuntu+1 for Intrepid questions, thanks.
2008-09-20T14:13:00.000Z	shingoki	Flannel	thanks
