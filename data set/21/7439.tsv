2006-09-27T14:06:00.000Z	morrye		How do you install the latest version of sun java on ubuntu?
2006-09-27T14:06:00.000Z	gnomefreak	morrye	sudo apt-get install sun-java5-plugin   it will grab -bin and -jre
2006-09-27T14:08:00.000Z	morrye	gnomefreak	I already have the latest version installed, but it doesn't come with all the libraries, I am assuming swing is used in the java linux enviroment.
2006-09-27T14:08:00.000Z	gnomefreak	morrye	swing might be in the jdk package
2006-09-27T14:08:00.000Z	morrye	gnomefreak	How would I aquire this? (very new to linux)
2006-09-27T14:09:00.000Z	gnomefreak	morrye	package is called sun-java5-jdk
2006-09-27T14:09:00.000Z	morrye	gnomefreak	Thanks for your help!
2006-10-03T06:18:00.000Z	gnomefreak	morrye	if it didnt error your good
2006-10-03T06:19:00.000Z	morrye	gnomefreak	it didn't error, how do I display the result?
2006-10-03T06:19:00.000Z	gnomefreak	morrye	is this your code or are you compiling using ./configure
2006-10-03T06:20:00.000Z	gnomefreak	morrye	C code?
2006-10-03T06:20:00.000Z	morrye	gnomefreak	Yeah C
2006-10-03T06:20:00.000Z	gnomefreak	morrye	what command did you use?
2006-10-03T06:21:00.000Z	morrye	gnomefreak	gcc hello.c -o hello
2006-10-03T06:21:00.000Z	gnomefreak	morrye	that should work than as long as you still have a main function and an end printf should just print whateve ryou have there
2006-10-03T06:22:00.000Z	morrye	gnomefreak	yeah it works now but throw up a lot of errors, do you need to install anything as well as build-essentials and gcc-4.0?
2006-10-03T06:22:00.000Z	gnomefreak	morrye	no not for a simple C program
2006-10-03T06:25:00.000Z	gnomefreak	morrye	./hello
2006-10-03T06:25:00.000Z	gnomefreak	morrye	no
2006-10-03T06:26:00.000Z	gnomefreak	morrye	if you made changes to code after compiling you need to re compile it
2006-10-03T06:26:00.000Z	morrye	gnomefreak	Thanks for all your help guys that worked.
