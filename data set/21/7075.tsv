2006-12-06T14:11:00.000Z	LordGoth		a question
2006-12-06T14:11:00.000Z	LordGoth		can someone instruct me on how to pull files from my NTFS partition over to Xubuntu?
2006-12-06T14:11:00.000Z	whyameye	LordGoth	can't Xubuntu see the partition OK?
2006-12-06T14:12:00.000Z	whyameye	LordGoth	is the partition mounted?
2006-12-06T14:13:00.000Z	whyameye	LordGoth	I don't really get it. You have 1 disk w/ 2 partitions, one is Linux and the other NTFS?
2006-12-06T14:14:00.000Z	whyameye	LordGoth	so if you type "mount" on the command line do you see where /dev/hdb1 is mounted?
2006-12-06T14:15:00.000Z	LordGoth	whyameye	this is what I get from terminal:
2006-12-06T14:15:00.000Z	whyameye	LordGoth	sorry I meant do you see where /dev/hda is mounted
2006-12-06T14:17:00.000Z	whyameye	LordGoth	try "sudo mkdir /mnt/hda"
2006-12-06T14:17:00.000Z	whyameye	LordGoth	then try "sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/hda1 /mnt/hda
2006-12-06T14:19:00.000Z	LordGoth	whyameye	no errors reported back. I assumed it worked?
2006-12-06T14:19:00.000Z	whyameye	LordGoth	so you typed both lines? Can you see your files? "ls /mnt/hda"
2006-12-06T14:20:00.000Z	whyameye	LordGoth	try "sudo ls /mnt/hda"
2006-12-06T14:20:00.000Z	whyameye	LordGoth	so are you set then?
2006-12-06T14:22:00.000Z	whyameye	LordGoth	I don't know thunar. You could use nautilus to drag and drop. From the command line: "gksudo nautilus"
2006-12-06T14:23:00.000Z	whyameye	LordGoth	you are on kubuntu, huh?
2006-12-06T14:24:00.000Z	whyameye	LordGoth	I would *not* recommend writing the ntfs drive from linux. Only read.
2006-12-06T14:24:00.000Z	LordGoth	whyameye	I'm on Xubuntu 6.06
2006-12-06T14:25:00.000Z	whyameye	LordGoth	right. Sorry. Forgot. is the xubuntu file manager called thunar or something?
2006-12-06T14:25:00.000Z	LordGoth	whyameye	yes.
2006-12-06T14:25:00.000Z	whyameye	LordGoth	then "sudo thunar" should be fine
