2009-08-09T21:35:00.000Z	falconic		Hey ... guys... seems like firefox (3.0 and 3.5) have suddenly started crashing on my system.
2009-08-09T21:35:00.000Z	falconic		this has happened once or twice before also.. but corrects out with a reboot.
2009-08-09T21:35:00.000Z	falconic		any idea what might be wrong.. or what I can do u diagnose the issue
2009-08-09T21:37:00.000Z	bishop	falconic	 have you tried another browser?
2009-08-09T21:37:00.000Z	falconic		@bishop.. opera is working fine..
2009-08-09T21:37:00.000Z	falconic		seems like issue with gnome because even pidgin crashed once...
2009-08-09T21:38:00.000Z	falconic		and firefox 3.0 also crashed...
2009-08-09T21:38:00.000Z	falconic		this happened earlier also.. but a reboot usually fixes the issue. any idea how I can diagnose the issue?
2009-08-09T21:38:00.000Z	bishop		thought so...cant give u the answer you need...stay with opera for now
2009-08-09T21:39:00.000Z	falconic		@bishop.. when u say thought so.. is this is a common problem ? because on googling I found lots of them.. but none matched my description [on cursory look]
2009-08-09T21:40:00.000Z	bishop	falconic	did u recently upgrade firefox to 3.5?
2009-08-09T21:41:00.000Z	falconic		@bishop.. No

2009-08-09T21:48:00.000Z	falconic		and still the error came.
