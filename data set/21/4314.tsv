2008-05-25T08:44:00.000Z	lnar		is it possible to make transparent metacity themes using compiz?
2008-05-25T08:45:00.000Z	Carbonflux	lnar	there is a theme manager called Emerald that works with compiz fairly well imo
2008-05-25T08:46:00.000Z	lnar	Carbonflux	i know about emerald, just want to make metacity transparent.... ANY IDEAS?
2008-05-25T08:47:00.000Z	Carbonflux	lnar	well, you can use the general settings in compiz to set the transparency of windows etc, but thats not want you want?
2008-05-25T08:48:00.000Z	lnar	Carbonflux	u know what to type in to make metacity transparent and gnome panel?
2008-05-25T08:50:00.000Z	Carbonflux	lnar	what do you mean by metacity in this case? the panel can be made transparent by going into system->preferences->advanced desktop settings->general->opacity tab then create a entry for name=gnome-panel
2008-05-25T08:52:00.000Z	Carbonflux	lnar	if you want to make all windows transparent automaticlly, you can use any
2008-05-25T08:52:00.000Z	Carbonflux	lnar	but that is hard to do
2008-05-25T08:52:00.000Z	Carbonflux	lnar	because it sets all your windows to zero first
2008-05-25T08:53:00.000Z	Carbonflux	lnar	the word "any" I mean, just put that in a opacity value entry, before you do tho find out what key/mouse combo lets you control the transparency of all the windows, heh
2008-05-25T08:53:00.000Z	lnar	Carbonflux	got it, but still try to make metacity transparent, is there any web page with all name of settings to make transparent?
2008-05-25T08:54:00.000Z	Carbonflux		the word is "any" lnar
2008-05-25T08:55:00.000Z	Carbonflux	lnar	its tricky applying it tho, because the default value is 0
2008-05-25T08:56:00.000Z	lnar		got it, i can name=what ever i want
