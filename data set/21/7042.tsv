2006-12-10T07:12:00.000Z	A3n		is there some alternative to windows media player in ubuntu? cause VLC doesnt have mush options
2006-12-10T07:12:00.000Z	ColonelZarkawi	A3n	mplayer
2006-12-10T07:12:00.000Z	ColonelZarkawi	A3n	eee no
2006-12-10T07:13:00.000Z	ColonelZarkawi	A3n	you can play mp3 files with it if you wish
2006-12-10T07:14:00.000Z	ColonelZarkawi	A3n	for music, mplayer is not the right program.
2006-12-10T07:14:00.000Z	ColonelZarkawi	A3n	there is no program which has music+video functionality as windows media player
2006-12-10T07:15:00.000Z	ColonelZarkawi	A3n	for music you can use amarok or rhythmbox
2006-12-10T07:15:00.000Z	ColonelZarkawi	A3n	or banshee
2006-12-10T07:15:00.000Z	ColonelZarkawi	A3n	or beep-media-player (less functionality)
2006-12-10T07:16:00.000Z	ColonelZarkawi	A3n	use amarok then
2006-12-10T07:16:00.000Z	ColonelZarkawi	A3n	sure, music files only not videos
2006-12-10T07:17:00.000Z	ColonelZarkawi	A3n	ok
2006-12-10T07:17:00.000Z	ColonelZarkawi	A3n	amarok is better than rhythmbox, try it
2006-12-10T07:23:00.000Z	ColonelZarkawi	A3n	not suprising given the bad quality of windows based software
2006-12-10T07:26:00.000Z	ColonelZarkawi	A3n	yes
2006-12-10T07:26:00.000Z	ColonelZarkawi	A3n	is very good at it. Uses an internal (or configurable external) relational database
2006-12-10T07:26:00.000Z	ColonelZarkawi	A3n	so amarok scales very well with huge playlists
2006-12-10T07:26:00.000Z	ColonelZarkawi	A3n	try it is one of the best players available (if not the best)
2006-12-10T07:27:00.000Z	A3n	ColonelZarkawi	and it doesnt matter if my music is on ntfs partition that i mounted and is in read-only mode ?
2006-12-10T07:27:00.000Z	ColonelZarkawi	A3n	it should not make any difference.
2006-12-10T07:27:00.000Z	ColonelZarkawi	A3n	you can even access your mp3 player very easy
