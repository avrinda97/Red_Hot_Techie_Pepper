2006-12-29T07:28:00.000Z	stefg		arose... i know the blues... that
2006-12-29T07:28:00.000Z	stefg		's why i decided to kick the stock-kernels
2006-12-29T07:29:00.000Z	magicfingers11	stefg	 can you help please
2006-12-29T07:29:00.000Z	stefg	magicfingers11	are you the grub error 21 person?
2006-12-29T07:30:00.000Z	stefg	magicfingers11	so get a terminal and enter 'sudo -s' in there. the prompt should change to 'root@ubuntu'
2006-12-29T07:32:00.000Z	stefg	magicfingers11	Is there no ubuntu-install on the disk now?
2006-12-29T07:33:00.000Z	stefg	magicfingers11	so no need to troubleshoot... just install
2006-12-29T07:38:00.000Z	stefg	magicfingers11	let me see your disk, as it is now... type 'sudo fdisk -l' to a term and paste the result to pastebin
2006-12-29T07:42:00.000Z	stefg	magicfingers11	2 disks... that's good :-) where do you want to have your ubuntu installed?
2006-12-29T07:43:00.000Z	stefg	magicfingers11	is that dispensible ? any data on it, or can you just flatten that 80GB drive?
2006-12-29T07:44:00.000Z	stefg	magicfingers11	brilliant... then let the installer do his automatic job on sda1... but beware: grub gets installed to hda, that means you can't remove the 80 GB drive or you'll get grub errors :-)
2006-12-29T07:45:00.000Z	stefg	magicfingers11	the instzaller will deal with that
2006-12-29T07:50:00.000Z	stefg	magicfingers11	a fuuny question, because the answer is already in it ...
2006-12-29T07:53:00.000Z	stefg	magicfingers11	just let the installer auto-partiton sda and install ubuntu to it
2006-12-29T07:54:00.000Z	stefg	magicfingers11	then you'd need aboot-floppy for ubuzntu
2006-12-29T07:55:00.000Z	stefg	magicfingers11	the bios can only boot from the first hd... if you install grub somewhere else it might be ibstalled, but is never actually booted
2006-12-29T07:59:00.000Z	stefg	magicfingers11	and restoring you win- Master Boor record all it takes is booting the win-install CD to the rescue conole and type 'fixmbr' in the windows command shell..
2006-12-29T08:16:00.000Z	stefg	magicfingers11	after i looked at your harddisk-conf i'll assume that grub can't see the sda at boottime...
2006-12-29T08:16:00.000Z	stefg	magicfingers11	so grub points in the vacuum which is filled only later with sda
2006-12-29T08:22:00.000Z	stefg	magicfingers11	your bios doesn't allow an ubuntu installtion to sda... take one of the /h/ da's
2006-12-29T08:25:00.000Z	stefg	magicfingers11	no, grub can't see the disk... you need to install to a disk which is visible immediatly after power on
