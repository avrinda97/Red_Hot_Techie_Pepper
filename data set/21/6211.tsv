2007-09-25T14:18:00.000Z	cjae_		is there a dameon or something to refresh /usr/bin to it does not take so long to open it 2000+ executables besides cli
2007-09-25T14:20:00.000Z	eck	cjae_	no, some filesystems will put the dirents in contiguous sectors on disk though to speed it up (e.g. xfs)
2007-09-25T14:20:00.000Z	eck		ext3 does not do well with large directories
2007-09-25T14:20:00.000Z	cjae_		ahh
2007-09-25T14:21:00.000Z	cjae_	eck	what about reiser
2007-09-25T14:21:00.000Z	eck	cjae_	i'm not sure, i would recommend xfs over reiserfs though
2007-09-25T14:22:00.000Z	eck		in general xfs is a lot faster
2007-09-25T14:22:00.000Z	eck		and imho more reliable
2007-09-25T14:22:00.000Z	cjae_		it changing filesystems very stable eck
2007-09-25T14:23:00.000Z	eck		you have to reinstall/copy the files over, you can't convert a filesystem in place
2007-09-25T14:23:00.000Z	eck		although if cli is fast for you to list the directory contents then whatever app you are using that is slow sucks
2007-09-25T14:24:00.000Z	cjae_	eck	sorry I know one should have backup before really attempting anything but what is the likely hood of losing all data converting ext3 to xfs
2007-09-25T14:24:00.000Z	eck	cjae_	zero? you'd just have to reinstall
2007-09-25T14:24:00.000Z	cjae_	eck	I see no other way then
2007-09-25T14:25:00.000Z	cjae_	eck	I know you could fat to nt but I never tried it
2007-09-25T14:25:00.000Z	eck		well however it takes to "time echo * /usr/bin" is how fast the fs can do it
2007-09-25T14:25:00.000Z	eck		err, echo /usr/bin/*
2007-09-25T14:26:00.000Z	eck		i think the gtk file picker is just slow
2007-09-25T14:26:00.000Z	eck		although it's better than it used to be
2007-09-25T14:27:00.000Z	cjae_	eck	using thunar under xubuntu
2007-09-25T14:27:00.000Z	eck	cjae_	i think it is still using the same gtk lib
