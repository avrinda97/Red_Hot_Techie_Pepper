2011-05-02T03:07:00.000Z	kneaux		Does anyone know why I would be getting the error "maximum=(1440,1440)" when I try to turn on a second monitor?
2011-05-02T03:07:00.000Z	escott	kneaux	nvidia or ati
2011-05-02T03:08:00.000Z	escott	kneaux	what does xrandr say about your allowed geometries
2011-05-02T03:09:00.000Z	kneaux	escott	anything specific you want? First of all, it seems to think I have a CRT connected, which I don't, dunno if that's part of the problem or not
2011-05-02T03:10:00.000Z	escott	kneaux	could very well be the source of trouble. xorg is getting better and detecting more automatically but that means it has more opportunities to detect it incorrectly
2011-05-02T03:11:00.000Z	kneaux	escott	should i write it into my xorg.conf? cos it's not there now.
2011-05-02T03:11:00.000Z	escott	kneaux	i would try and set it through xrandr, but if you cant you could force your modelines into xorg.conf
2011-05-02T03:12:00.000Z	kneaux	escott	(also, xrandr doesn't say /anything/ about minimum=320/240 or maximum=1440/1440, which is the error Montors is giving me)
2011-05-02T03:12:00.000Z	escott	kneaux	so its guessing at bad modes from the display can you force a good mode with xrandr?
2011-05-02T03:13:00.000Z	kneaux	escott	i don't know how, reading the help now but i've never used it before, so
2011-05-02T03:17:00.000Z	kneaux	escott	david8732, the second monitor is set to 1280/800 (max is higher) and mirror screens is on, but when I turn off mirror screens I get the error about exceeding 1440/1440. The only thing I can come up with is it thinks there's a maximum width for both screens combined, or is treating them as one screen when they're separate displays, or something of that nature. Why, I have no idea.
2011-05-02T03:19:00.000Z	escott	kneaux	when you turn off mirror screens any change in what xrandr reports
2011-05-02T03:24:00.000Z	kneaux	escott	i can't turn off mirror screens, that's the problem
2011-05-02T03:24:00.000Z	kneaux	escott	when i try it gives me that error and reverts
2011-05-02T03:30:00.000Z	kneaux	escott	trying to search for a config file with 1440 in it anywhere right now...
2011-05-07T07:11:00.000Z	escott	kneaux	no problems playing the audio?
2011-05-07T07:12:00.000Z	kneaux	escott	no. I just took a look at the log, it's failing because I'm burning FLAC files now
2011-05-07T07:14:00.000Z	kneaux	escott	it's odd, I can put the flac in the project, but as soon as it tries to start preparing the burn it ejects the CD instead
2011-05-07T07:22:00.000Z	escott	kneaux	have you installed restricted-extras?
2011-05-07T07:23:00.000Z	kneaux	escott	what's the package name (no)
2011-05-07T07:25:00.000Z	escott	kneaux	ubuntu-restricted-extras
