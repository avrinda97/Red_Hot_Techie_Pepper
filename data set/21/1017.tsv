2011-03-10T12:00:00.000Z	StepNjump		Hi guys, I would like to install the display drivers for my new Acer Netbook D255-1268 (runs on dualcore N550).  So far, the only thing I have tried is to run the Additional drivers wizard found in the systems menu. Any ideas?
2011-03-10T12:01:00.000Z	mrdebuntu	StepNjump	that should work. what are you getting when you activate recommended?
2011-03-10T12:02:00.000Z	StepNjump	mrdebuntu	nothing comes up unfortunately
2011-03-10T12:02:00.000Z	mrdebuntu	StepNjump	do you have nvidia video?
2011-03-10T12:03:00.000Z	StepNjump		Mrdebuntu. I'm to quite sure. I could check the specifications
2011-03-10T12:03:00.000Z	mrdebuntu		let me check
2011-03-10T12:03:00.000Z	mrdebuntu	StepNjump	have you ran update manager first?
2011-03-10T12:04:00.000Z	StepNjump	mrdebuntu	yes, I ran the update manager
2011-03-10T12:05:00.000Z	mrdebuntu	StepNjump	is there an issue with your display?
2011-03-10T12:09:00.000Z	StepNjump	mrdebuntu	no, not really other than that the FXs are all grayed out in the Visual appearance ! Visual effects
2011-03-10T12:10:00.000Z	mrdebuntu	StepNjump	hmm ok. it may be a newer intel graphics chip.  the intel driver is typically automatically installed and features 3d effects in linux
2011-03-10T12:11:00.000Z	StepNjump	mrdebuntu	The main reason that motivated me to try to download new video drivers is because my mouse is very quick to go all over the place when I type.. In one forum, someone was suggesting to download new video drivers (I don't see what the reason for doing so is)
2011-03-10T12:12:00.000Z	StepNjump		Mrdebuntu: Here are my specs: Display: 10.1-inch (1024 x 600) 200-nitere TFT LCD
2011-03-10T12:12:00.000Z	StepNjump		Chipset: Mobile Intel NM10 Express
2011-03-10T12:12:00.000Z	StepNjump		Graphics: Integrated Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 3150
2011-03-10T12:12:00.000Z	mrdebuntu	StepNjump	all right. well, i will research your particular model and see i find anything. as far as i know, the driver should automatically work for intel, sans some newer chipset models.
2011-03-10T12:14:00.000Z	StepNjump		Mrdebuntu: Like you say, maybe it's too recent... Would you have a work around for preventing mouse to go all over the place whilst typing?
2011-03-10T12:15:00.000Z	mrdebuntu	StepNjump	what about the mouse settings? have you experimented with changing acceleration there?
2011-03-10T12:16:00.000Z	StepNjump		Mrdebuntu: I don't know exactly what happens but my mouse goes all over the place at times.. Windows close and open... I don't really know if it's due to the mouse or something else... Sometimes I will see my mouse pointer go all over the place really quick!
2011-03-10T12:19:00.000Z	StepNjump		Mrdebuntu: Conservatively, I disabled the scrolling feature under mouse settings and flagged disable touchpad while typing  but that doesn't seem to make a difference. When I say I have problem with my mouse, I should have referred to it as the touchpad. Sorry. No! It's an Acer netbook.
2011-03-10T12:21:00.000Z	mrdebuntu	StepNjump	ok
