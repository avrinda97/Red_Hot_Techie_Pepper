2006-10-08T15:46:00.000Z	jrib	silverman	you can open it with Archive Manager too
2006-10-08T15:34:00.000Z	jrib	silverman	you may also want to consider the help.ubuntu.com tutorial if you want to do it the "right" way
2006-10-08T15:36:00.000Z	silverman	jrib	i read about checkinstall, but it only can do with full source which include makefile and configure. i have a folder and i want to make it .deb so i extract it whenever i reinstall OS
2006-10-08T15:38:00.000Z	silverman	jrib	any idea ?
2006-10-08T15:39:00.000Z	jrib	silverman	I've not sure what you want to do.  Why not just tar your folder and then extract it?
2006-10-08T15:40:00.000Z	silverman	jrib	a folder some programs i want to use .deb so when i install every file goes to right place.. for example mygame goes to game on menu
2006-10-08T15:41:00.000Z	jrib	silverman	do you just want to create a backup?  There are tools specifically for that
2006-10-08T15:43:00.000Z	silverman	jrib	not only backup... i want it to check for dep as well if its not there it wget and install it as well
2006-10-08T15:44:00.000Z	silverman	jrib	maybe my question is not clear... thanks anyway i'll try to google it
2006-10-08T15:44:00.000Z	jrib	silverman	yeah I don't think I know exactly what you mean, but good luck, hope you find it
2006-10-08T15:46:00.000Z	silverman	jrib	another question can i unpack .dep file to see the files without installing it ?
2006-10-08T15:46:00.000Z	jrib	silverman	if you mean .deb, yes.  dpkg -x
2006-10-08T15:48:00.000Z	silverman	jrib	u mean roller Archive Manager?
2006-10-08T15:48:00.000Z	jrib	silverman	yes
2006-10-08T15:49:00.000Z	silverman	jrib	yes that worked thanks alot
2006-10-08T15:53:00.000Z	silverman	jrib	i know i botherd u alot... last question sir...... how to repack it to original .dep
2006-10-08T15:54:00.000Z	jrib	silverman	you'll need to read the tutorial at help.ubuntu.com.  dpkg-buildpackage is the final command you will be working with
2006-10-08T15:56:00.000Z	silverman	jrib	iam at that page cant find dpkg-buildpackage !
2006-10-08T15:57:00.000Z	jrib	silverman	maybe they use debuild
2006-10-08T15:57:00.000Z	jrib	silverman	maybe this is more what you want: http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/20
2006-10-08T15:58:00.000Z	silverman	jrib	yah that nice... now i'll read this site hope it work the way i want it http://linux.about.com/od/ubupck_doc/a/ubupg12t07.htm
