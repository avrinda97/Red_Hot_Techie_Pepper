2006-11-24T14:36:00.000Z	eNons3nse		ok.  i'm having a wifi problem.  i can use a wired connection straight to my router just fine.  i can connect to my wireless router just fine and network-manager even says i'm at 95-100% signal strength.  when i'm connected to wireless though my desktop internet doesnt work.  almost like i don't really have a connection.  everything worked fine with my wireless a couple weeks ago.
2006-11-24T14:36:00.000Z	TMX	eNons3nse	can you ping the router?
2006-11-24T14:38:00.000Z	TMX	eNons3nse	open up a shell, type "ping " then the address of the router
2006-11-24T14:38:00.000Z	eNons3nse	TMX	would that be 192.168.100.1?
2006-11-24T14:42:00.000Z	eNons3nse	TMX	I guess not.  I kept getting "Destination Net Unreachable" errors.
2006-11-24T14:42:00.000Z	TMX	eNons3nse	sounds like a problem with the router is most likely, has somebody mucked about with the wirless settings maybe?
2006-11-24T14:44:00.000Z	eNons3nse	TMX	 actually.  I've never been able to change my wireless settings from the default.  the default admin password/username dont work.
2006-11-24T14:44:00.000Z	eNons3nse	TMX	so i can't get into the settings inside my router, but no one else can either.
2006-11-24T14:44:00.000Z	eNons3nse	TMX	since no one knows the name/password.
2006-11-24T14:46:00.000Z	TMX	eNons3nse	it could be that someone has gained access to the router wirelessly and guessed the username and pass
2006-11-24T14:46:00.000Z	TMX	eNons3nse	I have one of those, its blank user, password admin
2006-11-24T14:48:00.000Z	eNons3nse	TMX	 i'll try that.  so once i'm there I should try to change the channel that it's running on?
2006-11-24T14:52:00.000Z	eNons3nse	TMX	& Jowi:  that doesn't work.  still can't get into my router settings.  tried the routers reset button as well.
2006-11-24T14:52:00.000Z	TMX	eNons3nse	ah, if you've reset it that completely wipes the routers memory
2006-11-24T14:53:00.000Z	TMX	eNons3nse	the essid will be linksys now, with no encrption
2006-11-24T14:53:00.000Z	eNons3nse	TMX	maybe the reset didn't work then because it's still coming up as the old name for the router.
2006-11-24T14:54:00.000Z	TMX	eNons3nse	are you connected to it by wires?
2006-11-24T14:55:00.000Z	eNons3nse	TMX	no.  when i'm on this wired connection i'm running an ethernet cord straight from my modem.
2006-11-24T14:57:00.000Z	TMX	eNons3nse	maybe try wiring straight into the router, and trying to access the routers control panel
2006-11-24T14:57:00.000Z	eNons3nse	TMX	i don't have enough eithernet cables.  only have the one.
2006-11-24T15:00:00.000Z	TMX	eNons3nse	just don't tell them that :P I do it all the time, just silently transpose windows instructions to linux ones :)
