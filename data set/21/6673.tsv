2007-07-16T08:18:00.000Z	LuitvD		does anyone have experiance with the Bluetooth function of MSI S260, S270 or S271 series notebooks?
2007-07-16T08:20:00.000Z	LuitvD		does anyone have experiance with the Bluetooth function of MSI S260, S270 or S271 series notebooks?
2007-07-16T08:21:00.000Z	LuitvD		does anyone have experiance with the Bluetooth function of MSI S260, S270 or S271 series notebooks??? or with any type of notebook bluetooth function?
2007-07-16T08:21:00.000Z	scorp123	LuitvD	why?
2007-07-16T08:21:00.000Z	LuitvD	scorp123	mine won't work
2007-07-16T08:22:00.000Z	LuitvD	scorp123	it's a mini-pci-like device (the MP54GBT2 is Wifi and BT in 1) connected to an USB bus IIRC
2007-07-16T08:22:00.000Z	LuitvD	scorp123	but it's in neither lspci nor lsusb
2007-07-16T08:22:00.000Z	scorp123	LuitvD	yeah, it can happen that the Bluetooth function won't work under Linux. I got tons of problems too especially on Sony hardware.
2007-07-16T08:23:00.000Z	LuitvD	scorp123	with what kind of hardware is that?
2007-07-16T08:23:00.000Z	scorp123	LuitvD	Sony VAIO laptops ... for some model there is a driver (sonypi), but for others it won't work: To make bluetooth work you first need to get that stupid interrupt controller ....
2007-07-16T08:24:00.000Z	scorp123	LuitvD	I can imagine that other laptops may need Firmware or some other proprietary magic to get Bluetooth working properly.
2007-07-16T08:24:00.000Z	scorp123	LuitvD	on my Fujitsu-Siemens and HP Laptops it just works out of the box ....
2007-07-16T08:25:00.000Z	LuitvD	scorp123	some people made the device appear by modprobing hci_usb :S
2007-07-16T08:25:00.000Z	LuitvD	scorp123	it is  a USB device.. but somehow activated by a hardware command, through software, back to hardware
2007-07-16T08:26:00.000Z	scorp123	LuitvD	you see, that really depends on how your BT hardware is connected and integrated into your system.
2007-07-16T08:26:00.000Z	LuitvD	scorp123	need windows XP to activate it I guess... since the CD doesn't have any Vista drivers :P
2007-07-16T08:26:00.000Z	LuitvD	scorp123	it's a MP54GBT2 device
2007-07-16T08:26:00.000Z	LuitvD	scorp123	which is WiFi and BT in one miniPCI card
