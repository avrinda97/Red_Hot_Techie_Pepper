2011-09-02T10:30:00.000Z	almoxarife	learner	xchat is a good choice for 'irc'
2011-09-02T10:30:00.000Z	almoxarife	learner	if you decide to esperiment, try pidgin, irc without the irc look,
2011-09-02T10:35:00.000Z	almoxarife	learner	yes, to a degree

2011-09-02T10:40:00.000Z	almoxarife	learner	I will assume though that since it was working fine till I saw no network that the issue is 'no network avail'
