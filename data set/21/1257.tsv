2011-01-10T03:50:00.000Z	mdgeorge		hello
2011-01-10T03:51:00.000Z	mdgeorge		I'm trying to apply some patches to my kernel.  I used apt-get source to retreive it, and patched it up.  Now I'm wondering how to turn that source back into a .deb that I can install
2011-01-10T03:51:00.000Z	mdgeorge		can anyone point me in the right direction?
2011-01-10T03:51:00.000Z	sam-_-	mdgeorge	you don't need to make a *.deb
2011-01-10T03:52:00.000Z	sam-_-	mdgeorge	just copy the kernel and make modules-install
2011-01-10T03:52:00.000Z	sam-_-	mdgeorge	read here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/Compile
2011-01-10T03:54:00.000Z	mdgeorge	sam-_-	I assume I should follow the instructions for lucid since there are no mav. instructions?
2011-01-10T03:55:00.000Z	sam-_-	mdgeorge	i don't think anything has changed
2011-01-10T03:55:00.000Z	sam-_-	mdgeorge	may i ask why you make a custom kernel?
2011-01-10T03:56:00.000Z	sam-_-	mdgeorge	what's your soundcard?
2011-01-10T03:57:00.000Z	mdgeorge	sam-_-	it's an m-audio fast-track pro usb device
2011-01-10T03:57:00.000Z	mdgeorge	sam-_-	there's a patch for it, but it doesn't support the features I want
2011-01-10T03:57:00.000Z	mdgeorge	sam-_-	so I'm gonna fix it :)
2011-01-10T03:58:00.000Z	sam-_-	mdgeorge	so you want to add code to the driver yourself?
2011-01-10T03:58:00.000Z	mdgeorge	sam-_-	yes.
2011-01-10T03:59:00.000Z	sam-_-	mdgeorge	ah ok. otherwise i would have pointed you to http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/
2011-01-10T03:59:00.000Z	sam-_-	mdgeorge	new kernels without the hassle of compiling yourself
2011-01-10T03:59:00.000Z	mdgeorge	sam-_-	what is that?
2011-01-10T04:00:00.000Z	mdgeorge	sam-_-	also, I want to build a realtime kernel, which I don't see there.
2011-01-10T04:00:00.000Z	mdgeorge	sam-_-	I got it from someone's ppa.
2011-01-10T04:01:00.000Z	sam-_-	mdgeorge	y. i think the realtime patches aren't in mainline (yet)
