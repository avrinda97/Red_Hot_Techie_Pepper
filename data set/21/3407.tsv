2009-05-14T13:53:00.000Z	sacarlson		﻿ vertix:  I think I my be talking out my ass but maybe you could try supergrub boot cd disk.  it sounds like a grub problem.  That seems to fix stuff that seems imposible to fix at boot
2009-05-14T13:53:00.000Z	sacarlson		﻿ vertix:  it sounds like the stage 1.5 grub doesn't have the needed drivers to jump to the next step
2009-05-14T13:55:00.000Z	sacarlson		﻿nush: try apt-get update  and try again,  if that fails maybe try another depo sever
2009-05-14T13:55:00.000Z	Gnea	sacarlson	they don't maintain that site anymore
2009-05-14T13:58:00.000Z	Gnea	sacarlson	the one that nush *just* pasted
2009-05-14T14:04:00.000Z	Gnea	sacarlson	sudo mount -o loop file.iso dir/
2009-05-17T11:41:00.000Z	Gnea	sacarlson	kai is on Xubuntu
2010-08-28T14:04:00.000Z	Gnea	sacarlson	Baram: I've had great success with wired and wifi with wicd. the thing that sucks is that wicd is in Ubuntu is still 1.x, while the 2.0 is in development mode right now, 2.0 is going to have a lot more functionality and features. Looking forward to its release.
2010-08-28T14:08:00.000Z	Gnea	sacarlson	yeah, I got used to that with slackware and debian back in the day.... took awhile to get used to the way some of these programs that Ubuntu utilizes works, but when they work, they work well and I can just forget about them and get some real work done
2010-08-28T14:10:00.000Z	sacarlson	Gnea	I'm sure wicd would be the way to go on my laptop with wifi and moving from one net to anouther, but my desktop is just fixed static, no real need for a network manager.
2010-08-28T14:13:00.000Z	Gnea	sacarlson	I moved recently and now everything is straight-up wifi, so I had to buy a usb adapter for my desktop. Ubuntu doesn't even have the driver, so I had to find the source off of ralink's site, hack it to accept the USB id, compile and install it, and it works like a charm now. Full 802.11n
2010-08-28T14:15:00.000Z	sacarlson	Gnea	I have a ralink wifi rt73 chip wifi,  I used to have to compile each time I changed kernel but now works out of the box in U10.04
2010-08-28T14:17:00.000Z	Gnea	sacarlson	this linksys AE1000 is pretty nice once it works... the driver's got a bunch of options that I haven't tried yet (like switching between 2.4ghz and 5ghz)
2010-08-28T14:18:00.000Z	sacarlson	Gnea	ya the new ralink driver has cool injections and other cool monitoring mods
2010-08-28T14:19:00.000Z	Gnea	sacarlson	I've been so busy that I've just had time to get it up and running. have had a separate issue with it losing ipv6 connectivity, think I zeroed in on the problem and figured out what to do to fix it. got my fingers crossed right now.
2010-08-28T14:21:00.000Z	sacarlson	Gnea	my ISP doesn't support ipv6,  does yours?  when I played with ipv6 it seemed slow since it forced going through a tunel to another slow service.
2010-08-28T14:21:00.000Z	Gnea	sacarlson	my school does, yes. when I use wicd, I get an ipv4 and ipv6 address assignments
2010-08-28T14:23:00.000Z	Gnea	sacarlson	cisco wifi routers ftw
2010-08-28T14:23:00.000Z	Gnea	sacarlson	for the win
2010-08-28T14:26:00.000Z	Gnea	sacarlson	I'm not sure that windows is ready to let go of ipv4
2010-08-28T14:29:00.000Z	Gnea	sacarlson	ipv4 and ipv6 were developed using unix/linux, initially. microsoft came along and just interpretted the RFC's and available source code. Apple didn't have to do a thing, since BSD took care of it all for them.
