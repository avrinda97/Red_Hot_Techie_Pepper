2012-02-01T13:28:00.000Z	ServerSage	rick__	Did you download a debian/ubuntu version of aurora?
2012-02-01T13:31:00.000Z	ServerSage	rick__	In order to use it you need to extract it.  When you download it from their site they give you a tar.bz2 file.  You can either double click on that an your GUI will probably extract it for you, leaving you with an executable, or you can extract it on the command line.
2012-02-01T13:33:00.000Z	ServerSage	rick__	If extracting a downloaded file, or using the command line, is outside your realm of knowledge, do you think it's a good idea to run alpha/beta software?  Not trying to be a jerk, just saying.
2012-02-01T13:36:00.000Z	ServerSage	rick__	Thats one way to get help.
2012-02-01T13:38:00.000Z	ServerSage	rick__	Do you know which *buntu and which GUI you are running?
2012-02-01T13:40:00.000Z	ServerSage	rick__	Drop the attitude.  Were here to help.  You need to remember that most of us are actually sitting at jobs right now WHILE trying to help you.
2012-02-01T13:52:00.000Z	ServerSage	rick__	Did you not read what the good bot told you earlier?
2012-02-01T13:53:00.000Z	ServerSage	rick__	Seriously?
2012-02-01T13:54:00.000Z	ServerSage	rick__	You've been given help.  Other than driving to your house and opening it for you what more would you like?
2012-02-01T13:55:00.000Z	ServerSage	rick__	Read the help!  It tells you EXACTLY WHAT TO CLICK.
2012-02-01T13:56:00.000Z	ServerSage	rick__	click the Ubuntu logo and start typing terminal.
2012-02-01T13:58:00.000Z	ServerSage	rick__	Do you know where you downloaded the firefox file?
2012-02-01T13:58:00.000Z	ServerSage	rick__	Yes, but where did you save it to?
2012-02-01T14:03:00.000Z	ServerSage	rick__	Try running "ls", do you see a Downloads listed?
2012-02-01T14:04:00.000Z	ServerSage	rick__	Then type "cd downloads"
2012-02-01T14:05:00.000Z	ServerSage	rick__	You have to match the case.  So if it's Downloads you need to do "cd Downloads"
2012-02-01T14:09:00.000Z	ServerSage	rick__	Try running "ls -l"
2012-02-01T14:10:00.000Z	ServerSage	rick__	Yes, in the terminal type in "ls -l" without the quotes.
2012-02-01T14:11:00.000Z	ServerSage	rick__	You sure you downloaded it?  :)
