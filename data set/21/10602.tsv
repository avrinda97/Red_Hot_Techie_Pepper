2005-01-24T07:47:00.000Z	pdkl		guess please
2005-01-24T07:47:00.000Z	pdkl		its obvious
2005-01-24T07:49:00.000Z	pdkl		ok ok
2005-01-24T07:49:00.000Z	pdkl		its... rpm hell
2005-01-24T07:50:00.000Z	pdkl		lets say you install rh on a desktop for a webbrowser user
2005-01-24T07:50:00.000Z	pdkl		typical for a secetary that only job is to surf web, look up the phone directory
2005-01-24T07:51:00.000Z	pdkl		secetary or data entry person or telemarketer
2005-01-24T07:51:00.000Z	pdkl		then says hmmm.. i want to install... x application
2005-01-24T07:51:00.000Z	pdkl		they get savy enough after 2 weeks working with it, to find the rpm and install it
2005-01-24T07:52:00.000Z	pdkl		they get a suse rpm or something near that. or a mandrake rpm
2005-01-24T07:52:00.000Z	souki	pdkl	your not fair, deb is the same if you don't hav apr-get/synaptic
2005-01-24T07:52:00.000Z	souki	pdkl	there is apt/synaptic on redhat/fedora
2005-01-24T07:53:00.000Z	souki	pdkl	user cannot install rpm
2005-01-24T07:54:00.000Z	souki	pdkl	that why I say you are not fair
2005-01-24T07:55:00.000Z	souki	pdkl	you'll got the same sheet with your secretary on debian
2005-01-24T07:56:00.000Z	souki	pdkl	because if you give root password to him/her, rpm or deb is not the point
2005-01-24T07:58:00.000Z	souki	pdkl	you don't have choice, don't give it
2005-01-24T07:59:00.000Z	souki	pdkl	or maybe you can do something with sudo, but, the same problem at the end
2005-01-24T08:06:00.000Z	souki	pdkl	sorry, I don't see any differences between rpm and deb, except for the writing of the source package
2005-01-24T08:12:00.000Z	souki	pdkl	I think it's just about the way the rpl are written, but does .deb can handle this?
2005-01-24T08:13:00.000Z	souki	pdkl	I mean, if you try to install a rpm with bad dependencies
