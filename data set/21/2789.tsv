2009-06-19T22:18:00.000Z	dajhorn	henkboom	Do you mean "swap file" or "swap partition"?
2009-06-19T22:18:00.000Z	henkboom	dajhorn	swap file
2009-06-19T22:20:00.000Z	dajhorn	henkboom	The hibernation doohickey in Ubuntu, swsusp, is incompatible with swap files.  It must be a swap partition.
2009-06-19T22:20:00.000Z	henkboom	dajhorn	ah, ok
2009-06-19T22:20:00.000Z	henkboom	dajhorn	so repartition =)
2009-06-19T22:21:00.000Z	henkboom	dajhorn	I have / and /home managed in LVM, so I'll need to pull 3GB from one to use for swap, what's the easiest way to handle that repartitioning?
2009-06-19T22:22:00.000Z	dajhorn	henkboom	I dunno.  I've only ever used the cli to manipulate LVM things.
2009-06-19T22:23:00.000Z	dajhorn	henkboom	I'll wager you an oatmeal cookie that the swap partition must be a real primary partition.
2009-06-19T22:29:00.000Z	dajhorn	henkboom	If this is your first LVM resize, then you should make a backup.
2009-06-19T22:29:00.000Z	henkboom	dajhorn	true, I have a backup as of two days ago (when I installed ubuntu) but I should probably update it first
2009-06-20T01:29:00.000Z	dajhorn	henkboom	 setterm -blength 0
2009-06-20T01:29:00.000Z	dajhorn	henkboom	 Will kill the system beep.
2009-06-20T01:30:00.000Z	henkboom	dajhorn	that only affects the current terminal though, doesn't it?
2009-06-20T01:30:00.000Z	dajhorn	henkboom	System -> Preferences -> Sound Preferences [ ] Play alert sound
2009-06-20T01:30:00.000Z	dajhorn	henkboom	To kill the gnome beep.
2009-06-20T01:31:00.000Z	dajhorn	henkboom	You can put the setterm command profile and it should be effective for all sessions.
2009-06-20T01:31:00.000Z	dajhorn	henkboom	* in your profile
2009-06-20T01:31:00.000Z	henkboom	dajhorn	for all programs or just terminals?
2009-06-20T01:32:00.000Z	dajhorn	henkboom	For just the gnome terminal,  Edit -> Preferences -> General -> [ ] Terminal bell
2009-06-20T01:32:00.000Z	dajhorn	henkboom	You can even set the beepiness for each gnome terminal profile.
2009-06-20T01:33:00.000Z	henkboom	dajhorn	I'd already done that in gnome-terminal actually, I was getting the beeps in gtk apps. Disabling it in the gnome sound preferences fixed it though
