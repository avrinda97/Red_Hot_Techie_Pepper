2007-04-21T07:10:00.000Z	PurpZeY		I am seriously consider an Ubuntu install, can someone answer a couple of quick ?s?
2007-04-21T07:10:00.000Z	jrib	PurpZeY	just ask, if someone knows, they will try
2007-05-06T05:01:00.000Z	jrib	PurpZeY	no, but apt will tell you exactly what it wants to do if it does decide it needs to do more
2007-05-06T05:02:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jrib	Got it...I am just trying to move over to pidgin and I keep getting an error about gaim...and I the info I read said to use that command first
2007-05-06T05:04:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jrib	I just got "Removing ubuntu-desktop" from that command...That something I need to fix?
2007-05-06T05:05:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jrib	Also nautilis-sendto ?
2007-05-06T05:05:00.000Z	jrib	PurpZeY	well I guess you lose that
2007-06-01T13:26:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jrib	I am jumping in, and might misunderstand...It's on the LiveCD also...Learned that the hardway.
2007-06-29T15:32:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jrib	I'm not sure what he's asking, but is there a way to skip the test, if it is not convenient at the time?
2007-06-29T15:34:00.000Z	jrib	PurpZeY	I'd like to know too :)
2007-06-29T15:34:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jrib	In other words, there is no way to do that, that you know of...
2007-06-29T15:37:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jrib	How do you do 'touch /fastboot' ? I mean, when I press the button to turn my lappy on, I have no point where I can enter any CLI things.
2007-06-29T15:37:00.000Z	jrib	PurpZeY	before you shutdown
2007-06-29T15:38:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jrib	I see, but, how do I verify the number of boots I've had previous to the boot? and also, if I do that, will it then do the check on my next boot?
2007-06-29T15:39:00.000Z	jrib	PurpZeY	comment in http://ubuntu.wordpress.com/2005/10/12/tuning-the-filesystem-check-at-bootup/ says you can hit ctrl-c followed by ctrl-d to stop it.  You can probably get how many times a partition has been mounted without being checked using tune2fs.  I think it will get checked the next time after you use /fastboot, but am not sure
2007-06-29T15:40:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jrib	Got it, thanks.
2007-07-06T07:39:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jrib	Is that something that needs to be added to the panel?
2007-07-06T07:39:00.000Z	jrib	PurpZeY	well you don't need to add it, depends if you like it
2007-07-06T07:40:00.000Z	PurpZeY	jrib	Right, what I meant was...It's not a standard part of the panel? (e.g. in the notification area)
2007-07-06T07:40:00.000Z	jrib	PurpZeY	ah, right
2007-07-16T05:57:00.000Z	jrib	PurpZeY	try the version in the repos first... if there is a problem you should file a bug so that it gets fixed
