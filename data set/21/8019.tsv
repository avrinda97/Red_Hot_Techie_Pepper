2007-11-01T16:50:00.000Z	josh_		can someone help with audio codecs?
2007-11-01T16:51:00.000Z	SeanTater	josh_	have you install the restricted formats?
2007-11-01T16:51:00.000Z	josh_		yes
2007-11-01T16:52:00.000Z	josh_		is there a specific package i should check for?
2007-11-01T16:52:00.000Z	SeanTater	josh_	probably not, AFAIK
2007-11-01T16:52:00.000Z	SeanTater		what errors are you getting
2007-11-01T16:52:00.000Z	josh_		I've installed all of the restricted formats that seem relevant
2007-11-01T16:53:00.000Z	josh_		I have some mythtv recordings in .mpg files
2007-11-01T16:53:00.000Z	josh_		and i can't seem to decode the audio in ffmpeg
2007-11-01T16:53:00.000Z	SeanTater	josh_	does it tell you what format it is?
2007-11-01T16:54:00.000Z	josh_		there are two different audio encodings
2007-11-01T16:54:00.000Z	josh_		Audio: ac3, 48000 Hz, 5 channels
2007-11-01T16:54:00.000Z	SeanTater	josh_	That's unusual
2007-11-01T16:54:00.000Z	SeanTater	josh_	ac3 is no issue
2007-11-01T16:54:00.000Z	josh_		 Audio: mp2, 48000 Hz, stereo
2007-11-01T16:54:00.000Z	SeanTater	josh_	mp2 is usually no problem either
2007-11-01T16:55:00.000Z	SeanTater	josh_	have you tried mapping one out?
2007-11-01T16:55:00.000Z	josh_		I have another, but much older machine, with an older copy of ubuntu that works fine with these formats
2007-11-01T16:56:00.000Z	SeanTater	josh_	does it give you any helpful information?
2007-11-01T16:57:00.000Z	josh_	SeanTater	what do you mean 'mapping one out'?
2007-11-01T16:58:00.000Z	SeanTater	josh_	use something like -map 0.1:1.0  on ffmpeg and make the second output file /dev/null .. or anything to get to one audio track
