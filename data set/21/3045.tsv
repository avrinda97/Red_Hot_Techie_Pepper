2009-05-02T22:39:00.000Z	Linuz2009		Can anyone tell me what's a keyring?
2009-05-02T22:39:00.000Z	Linuz2009		it kept popping up whenever I start my computer.
2009-05-02T22:40:00.000Z	usr13	Linuz2009	Just tell it a name and it will set you up.
2009-05-02T23:29:00.000Z	usr13	Linuz2009	What are you trying to do?
2009-05-02T23:31:00.000Z	usr13	Linuz2009	If you want [or need]  more space, get a larger drive. Or a second drive.
2009-05-02T23:32:00.000Z	usr13	Linuz2009	If you want a smaller install, try Xubuntu.
2009-05-02T23:32:00.000Z	usr13	Linuz2009	You may have a bit of trouble creating one, but you can go to the store and buy one.
2009-05-02T23:33:00.000Z	usr13	Linuz2009	Are you about to run out of hard drive space?
2009-05-02T23:34:00.000Z	usr13	Linuz2009	You can install an internal drive if you like, or you can just get an external drive if you prefer. It is up to you.  The choice is yours.
2009-05-02T23:36:00.000Z	usr13	Linuz2009	What you have installed is Ubuntu that is not just the operating system.  Ubuntu has many many open source applications for you to use.  One of them is OpenOffice, for instance, and OpenOffice takes up 200MB at least.
2009-05-02T23:37:00.000Z	usr13	Linuz2009	Pastebin what you want us to see.
2009-05-02T23:43:00.000Z	usr13	Linuz2009	I'm going to pass on to you some important information that applies to lots of different situations;  "If it aint broke, don't fix it."    Linux filesystems requre very little maintenance.  It requres some, but very little. What  little it does requre is done automatically for you.
2009-05-02T23:43:00.000Z	Linuz2009	usr13	sure
2009-05-02T23:57:00.000Z	usr13	Linuz2009	It can be made easy by sloppy use.  Basically, just use a good password that is hard to crack and you are safe.
2009-05-02T23:57:00.000Z	usr13	Linuz2009	You do not need anti-virus software.
2009-05-02T23:59:00.000Z	usr13	Linuz2009	One that is not too simple.  Maybe combine some numbers and maybe spell the word or name backwards or just random characters mixed with numbers.
2009-05-03T00:03:00.000Z	usr13	Linuz2009	Ubuntu does not use root account
2009-05-03T00:06:00.000Z	usr13	Linuz2009	Your root account is already protected.
2009-05-03T00:06:00.000Z	usr13	Linuz2009	You
2009-05-03T00:10:00.000Z	usr13	Linuz2009	You don't have a firewall installed by default, but you can install one.
2009-05-03T00:29:00.000Z	Linuz2009	usr13	is Linux immune to ALL malicious software?
