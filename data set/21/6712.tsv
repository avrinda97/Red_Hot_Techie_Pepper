2007-02-11T09:35:00.000Z	seravitae		Hi i have two network cards, onboard (doesnt work) and pci... I changed kernels and the onboard one appeared, but didnt work, and now the PCI one wont work. even when i change back to the other kernel.
2007-02-11T06:40:00.000Z	seravitae		what's an alternative to gnome-terminal that is good? (transparency and stuff) I cant use gnome-terminal because i found a bug in it.
2007-02-11T06:42:00.000Z	seravitae		yeah
2007-02-11T06:42:00.000Z	seravitae		well, it seems the problem also exists with xterm as well
2007-02-11T06:43:00.000Z	seravitae		i guess i will have to live without a terminal.
2007-02-11T06:43:00.000Z	seravitae		Oh, wait, xterm works. my bad.
2007-02-11T06:43:00.000Z	seravitae		I overflowed the integer value for the location of the window or something
2007-02-11T06:44:00.000Z	seravitae		basically i have a triple-xinerama setup here. gnome-terminal freaks out if i open it from another term.
2007-02-11T06:44:00.000Z	seravitae		Heh, yeah.
2007-02-11T06:44:00.000Z	twelvefour	seravitae	i bet it has something to do with overal
2007-02-11T06:43:00.000Z	twelvefour	seravitae	just curious, what bug have you found in it?
2007-02-11T06:43:00.000Z	seravitae	twelvefour	actually it's not really a *bug*, but it is a limitation.
2007-02-11T06:44:00.000Z	twelvefour	seravitae	oh, l33t
2007-02-11T06:45:00.000Z	seravitae	twelvefour	maybe
2007-02-11T06:45:00.000Z	twelvefour	seravitae	:/ yeah thats terrible, sounds like a very cool setup
2007-02-11T06:46:00.000Z	seravitae	twelvefour	i will probably whinge to gnome-terminal bug site or something, since this triple-head box will be hex-head soon.
2007-02-11T06:46:00.000Z	twelvefour	seravitae	good idea
2007-02-11T06:48:00.000Z	twelvefour	seravitae	ah just for fun? nice
2007-02-11T06:48:00.000Z	seravitae	twelvefour	haha. blatently, yes :P
2007-02-11T06:48:00.000Z	seravitae	twelvefour	 some kids spend $1000 on a graphics card. I see no point in that, ergonomics, features, accessories are my thing :)
2007-02-11T06:59:00.000Z	seravitae	twelvefour	identified and worked around the bug.
