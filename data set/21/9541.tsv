2005-09-16T09:19:00.000Z	LinuxJones	h0sl3r	you edit /etc/apt/sources.lst and change every reference to hoary to breezy, then apt-get update apt-get dist-upgrade
2005-09-16T09:20:00.000Z	h0sl3r	LinuxJones	so I just change the name and thats all?
2005-09-16T09:21:00.000Z	LinuxJones	h0sl3r	yes
2005-09-16T09:21:00.000Z	h0sl3r	LinuxJones	is there an example file on the internet somewhere?

2005-09-16T09:24:00.000Z	LinuxJones	h0sl3r	before you upgrade, be aware there are a few problems you'll likely encounter :)
2005-09-16T09:25:00.000Z	h0sl3r	LinuxJones	like what?
2005-09-16T09:26:00.000Z	LinuxJones	h0sl3r	there were a things like my keyboard settings preventing xorg from starting.
2005-09-16T09:26:00.000Z	h0sl3r	LinuxJones	well ill come back figure out how to fix it if i get those problems.
2005-09-16T09:40:00.000Z	h0sl3r	LinuxJones	What do I do to fix the keyboard problem after I upgrade?
2005-09-16T09:40:00.000Z	LinuxJones	h0sl3r	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2005-09-16T09:40:00.000Z	LinuxJones	h0sl3r	you may not even have to do it but I did
2005-09-16T09:43:00.000Z	h0sl3r	LinuxJones	how long does this update take?
2005-09-16T09:44:00.000Z	LinuxJones	h0sl3r	it was like a 450 MB download it too a while to install everything as well. Close to 1 1/2 hours for me
2005-09-16T10:11:00.000Z	h0sl3r	LinuxJones	sorry, but I need that command again.
2005-09-16T10:11:00.000Z	LinuxJones	h0sl3r	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
