2010-02-17T07:38:00.000Z	Induane		it is a cli program
2010-02-17T07:39:00.000Z	Induane		its an issue I'm having
2010-02-17T07:39:00.000Z	Induane		cli apps don't seem to work from the launcher men0
2010-02-17T07:39:00.000Z	Induane		menu  its a clean install
2010-02-17T07:39:00.000Z	Induane		yea tried application in terminal first
2010-02-17T07:39:00.000Z	Induane		then tried  gnome-terminal -x gksudo tf-tool --acquire
2010-02-17T07:39:00.000Z	Induane		which also works from a command line as it should - spawns a new terminal, asks for password, etc
2010-02-17T07:39:00.000Z	Induane		but in a launcher that doesn't work
2010-02-17T07:40:00.000Z	th0r	Induane	how are you invoking the cli program? I use 'xterm -e <command>' all the time
2010-02-17T07:40:00.000Z	Induane		I tried xterm -e as well
2010-02-17T07:40:00.000Z	Induane		it does the same thing
2010-02-17T07:40:00.000Z	Induane		what I tried specifically was xterm -e gksu tf-tool --acquire
2010-02-17T07:40:00.000Z	Induane		also I tried xterm -e gksudo "tf-tool --acquire"
2010-02-17T07:41:00.000Z	Induane		and a variety of other combinations around " "
2010-02-17T07:41:00.000Z	th0r	Induane	put the gksu first, invoke xterm as root
2010-02-17T07:41:00.000Z	Induane	th0r	yea just tried that too
2010-02-17T07:41:00.000Z	Induane		gksudo sh -c "gnome-terminal -x tf-tool --acquire"  even this fails
2010-02-17T07:41:00.000Z	Induane		^ I was running out of ideas
2010-02-17T07:42:00.000Z	Induane		tried same without the sh -c
2010-02-17T07:43:00.000Z	th0r	Induane	I wonder if it might be an issue within gnome. I use xfce, and while I am not in linux at the moment, I have a number of panel shortcuts that invoke terminal like we have been discussing
2010-02-17T07:44:00.000Z	Induane	th0r	its recent
