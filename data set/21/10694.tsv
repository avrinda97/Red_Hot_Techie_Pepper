2004-12-19T14:42:00.000Z	ironwolf	BockBilbo	universe is a place where unsupported stuff lives, but stuff you want.  mp3 encoders/decoders, etc.
2004-12-19T14:42:00.000Z	ironwolf	BockBilbo	Multiverse is the same, only mirrored less, things like a full mplayer, codecs, etc are in multiverse
2004-12-19T14:43:00.000Z	ironwolf	BockBilbo	how can we fix your confusion?
