2007-07-27T11:01:00.000Z	krel		where are ipods normally mounted?  I want to unmount mine but I can't find it.
2007-07-27T11:01:00.000Z	krel		(it's not in /media/ or /mnt/
2007-07-27T11:01:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	krel	sudo fdisk -l ... see where it's mounted and umount
2007-07-27T11:01:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	krel	or df -TH
2007-07-27T11:03:00.000Z	krel	Davy_Jones	it's /dev/sda2 in my fdisk -l, but it doesn't show up in df -TH
2007-07-27T11:04:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	krel	i was sure it shows up with fdisk -l , but wasn't sure about df
2007-07-27T11:04:00.000Z	krel	Davy_Jones	so how do I unmount it?
2007-07-27T11:04:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	krel	this might sounds stupid but did you do df -Th AFTER you umounted it?
2007-07-27T11:05:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	krel	sudo umount /dev/sda2
2007-07-27T11:05:00.000Z	krel	Davy_Jones	umount: /dev/sda2: not mounted
2007-07-27T11:06:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	krel	then it's unmounted
2007-07-27T11:06:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	krel	either that, or you got the wrong /dev/disk
2007-07-27T11:06:00.000Z	krel	Davy_Jones	so... why does the ipod still say "do not disconnect"
2007-07-27T11:06:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	krel	double check
2007-07-27T11:06:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	krel	not sure, i don't have an ipod.. too poor
2007-07-27T11:07:00.000Z	krel	Davy_Jones	did, the only things on df -TH are my main hd and 6 other <265M mounts
2007-07-27T11:07:00.000Z	krel	Davy_Jones	ipod's 2GB
2007-07-27T11:08:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	krel	yeah, i don't know why the iPod still says do not disconnect.. no experience with em
2007-07-27T11:13:00.000Z	krel	Davy_Jones	got it, i misread fdisk, it was sdb
2007-07-27T11:13:00.000Z	krel	Davy_Jones	thanks for the advice :)
2007-07-27T11:13:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	krel	no prob
