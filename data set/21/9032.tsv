2005-11-22T16:45:00.000Z	o_O		errr, can someone please help me install ubuntu?
2005-11-22T16:46:00.000Z	soundray	o_O	what's the trouble?
2005-11-22T16:46:00.000Z	soundray	o_O	how is your CD drive connected?
2005-11-22T16:50:00.000Z	soundray	o_O	maybe you need a special module to support your IDE chipset. How old is the machine?
2005-11-22T16:50:00.000Z	soundray	o_O	in that case, forget that.
2005-11-22T16:51:00.000Z	soundray	o_O	is that right?
2005-11-22T16:52:00.000Z	o_O	soundray	yes
2005-11-22T16:52:00.000Z	soundray	o_O	are you IRC'ing on the machine in question?
2005-11-22T16:53:00.000Z	o_O	soundray	no
2005-11-22T16:53:00.000Z	o_O	soundray	I have multiple machines
2005-11-22T16:53:00.000Z	soundray	o_O	can you activate a shell?
2005-11-22T16:54:00.000Z	o_O	soundray	yeah, the last option on the menu that came up after it failed brings me to a shell
2005-11-22T16:54:00.000Z	soundray	o_O	leave the installer running and open a shell with Alt-F2
2005-11-22T16:54:00.000Z	o_O	soundray	ok
2005-11-22T16:55:00.000Z	soundray	o_O	in Gentoo, your CD-ROMs are hda and hdac?
2005-11-22T16:55:00.000Z	o_O	soundray	yes
2005-11-22T16:56:00.000Z	soundray	o_O	what happens if you try to mount /dev/hd[a,c]  manually?
2005-11-22T16:57:00.000Z	o_O	soundray	mount: MOunting /dev/hdc on /cdrom failed: Invalid argument
2005-11-23T17:02:00.000Z	soundray	o_O	invalid argument sounds like /dev/hdc doesn't even exist.
2005-11-23T17:02:00.000Z	soundray	o_O	try a 'ls -l /dev/hdc'?
2005-11-23T17:03:00.000Z	o_O	soundray	/dev/hdc -> ide/host0/bus1/target0/lun0/cd
