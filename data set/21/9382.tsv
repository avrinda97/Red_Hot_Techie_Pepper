2006-01-21T17:33:00.000Z	limguohong91	Determinist	, same machine
2006-01-21T17:33:00.000Z	Determinist	limguohong91	mount the windows partitions into /media/ , what FS are they? ntfs or fat32?
2006-01-21T17:34:00.000Z	limguohong91	Determinist	fat32, how can I mount it?
2006-01-21T17:34:00.000Z	Determinist	limguohong91	hmm, can you tell which /dev/hdXX are your windows partitions?
2006-01-21T17:35:00.000Z	limguohong91	Determinist	, hd01
2006-01-21T17:35:00.000Z	Determinist	limguohong91	cant be... it should be /dev/hdaX hdbX etc
2006-01-21T17:36:00.000Z	Determinist	limguohong91	k, you can also just ls /dev/ | grep hd
2006-01-21T17:37:00.000Z	limguohong91	Determinist	, it is hda1 / fat32 flags = boot iba.
2006-01-21T17:37:00.000Z	Determinist	limguohong91	cool, ok, create say... /media/winxp, then do mount /dev/hda1 /media/winxp
2006-01-21T17:38:00.000Z	limguohong91	Determinist	, thanks so your help so far, may I know how can I do it?
2006-01-21T17:39:00.000Z	Determinist	limguohong91	erm, the commands i've just given you should mount it once till you reboot, to have that happen each and every time you can use a script to put that in /etc/fstab
2006-01-21T17:39:00.000Z	limguohong91	Determinist	, ok so is there anywhere where I can have that script?
2006-01-21T17:40:00.000Z	Determinist	limguohong91	yeah... it's in the last link ubotu just posted... http://www.ubuntulinux.nl/files/diskmounter
2006-01-21T17:40:00.000Z	Determinist	limguohong91	my pleasure mate :)
2006-01-21T17:42:00.000Z	Determinist	limguohong91	you need to chmod +x <file you just downloaded> and then run it using sh <filename>, you can then edit your fstab file if you dont like the names it's given your partitions. the added bonus is that now your windows partition would appear under the places menu in gnome :)
2006-01-21T17:44:00.000Z	Determinist	limguohong91	that works too :)
2006-01-21T17:44:00.000Z	Determinist	limguohong91	i had good teachers
2006-01-21T17:45:00.000Z	limguohong91	Determinist	:p Thanks a lot :D
