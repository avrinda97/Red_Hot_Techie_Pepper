2005-09-23T10:36:00.000Z	fadumpt		can someone point me to the iptables howto for ubuntu?
2005-09-23T10:36:00.000Z	fadumpt		I have an SSH port that needs to be opened up to the cold cruel world
2005-09-23T10:36:00.000Z	fadumpt		!tell fadumpt about iptables
2005-09-23T10:36:00.000Z	bob2	fadumpt	there's nothing to do
2005-09-23T10:37:00.000Z	bob2	fadumpt	not on ubuntu it's not
2005-09-23T10:37:00.000Z	bob2	fadumpt	perhaps you forgot to configure some router or firewall in front of it
2005-09-23T10:37:00.000Z	bob2	fadumpt	is it actually running?
2005-09-23T10:37:00.000Z	bob2	fadumpt	so, you're giving a very confusing and disparate description of the problem
2005-09-23T10:37:00.000Z	bob2	fadumpt	simplest would be for you to explain the whole situation on one line
2005-09-23T10:43:00.000Z	bob2	fadumpt	yes, of course
2005-09-23T10:43:00.000Z	bob2	fadumpt	you claimed it was runing, tho
2005-09-23T10:44:00.000Z	bob2	fadumpt	that is your problem then
2005-09-24T05:49:00.000Z	fadumpt	bob2	fixed my issue
2005-10-01T06:39:00.000Z	bob2	fadumpt	er, you want the contents of their /dev/dsp?
2005-10-01T06:40:00.000Z	bob2	fadumpt	that's not how it works, sorry
2005-10-01T06:40:00.000Z	bob2	fadumpt	reading from that file gives you audio data from their microphone
2005-10-01T06:41:00.000Z	bob2	fadumpt	/dev/dsp is their soundcard.  writing data to it makes sound come out the speakers. reading from it reads audi ofrom the microphone
2005-10-01T06:42:00.000Z	fadumpt	bob2	so I deleted my /dev/dsp, isn't someone else's more or less the same"?
2005-10-01T06:42:00.000Z	bob2	fadumpt	that was dumb
2005-10-01T06:42:00.000Z	bob2	fadumpt	but it will be recreated on reboot
2005-10-01T06:43:00.000Z	bob2	fadumpt	sudo mknod /dev/dsp c 14 3
