2007-05-16T13:22:00.000Z	r4nge		i'm currently using 6.10 and wanted to upgrade my GNUPG to latest release, i notice that there is no ubuntu package for the latest release but for 7.04 there is, is this what i should expect if i decide not to upgrade evrytime a new ubuntu is released?
2007-05-16T13:23:00.000Z	RAOF	r4nge	Yup, exactly.  New ubuntu = newer versions of everything (new versions generally == annoying bugs fixed :))
2007-05-16T13:24:00.000Z	r4nge	RAOF	hmm, perhaps i should take a look at debian, i dont want to have to upgrade my server with every ubuntu release
2007-05-16T13:25:00.000Z	RAOF	r4nge	Indeed.  You might want debian, but unless you use Unstable, you'll be generally getting *older* versions :)
2007-05-16T13:27:00.000Z	RAOF	r4nge	Yes, indeed.  It's not a release if you keep adding new stuff to it :)  (And debian releases are the same, I believe)
2007-05-16T13:27:00.000Z	r4nge	RAOF	but i think debian releases are spaced out a lot more
2007-05-16T13:27:00.000Z	RAOF	r4nge	Yes, so you have even *older* packages :P
2007-05-16T13:28:00.000Z	RAOF	r4nge	But you would, wouldn't you?  Unless your running debian unstable, you'll have a released version that doesn't get new packages.
2007-05-16T13:29:00.000Z	r4nge	RAOF	i assumed that for example Debian is at 4.0, while 4.0 is stable (which should be for a while), packages will be updated for it, so i'll be able to update gnupg for example until next Debian is released
2007-05-16T13:30:00.000Z	RAOF	r4nge	No, that's not the way it works.  Packages *don't* get updated, otherwise it's not a release.  New packages break new things :)
2007-05-16T13:30:00.000Z	r4nge	RAOF	whereas if Ubuntu releases a new stable every six months, i have to upgrade every six months in order to update packages i currently have
2007-05-16T13:31:00.000Z	RAOF	r4nge	Similar to Ubuntu.  People who run Etch (4.0) will have Gnome 2.16 for the entire life of etch.
2007-05-16T13:31:00.000Z	r4nge	RAOF	but if Gnome was updated while Etch was stable, wouldn't an updated package be released for it?
2007-05-16T13:32:00.000Z	RAOF	r4nge	*No*.  Because then Etch wouldn't be a release :)
2007-05-16T13:32:00.000Z	r4nge	RAOF	hmm, i think i understand
2007-05-16T13:32:00.000Z	RAOF	r4nge	Gnome has *already* been updated, it get's updated every 6 months. (Hence the Ubuntu release cycles) :)
2007-05-16T13:33:00.000Z	r4nge	RAOF	what puzzles me is that say for example 7.04 was just released and let's say that a major vulnerability was found in gnupg or some other sensitive app, you would be stuck with that vulnerable app until the next ubuntu release (if using packages exclusively)
2007-05-16T13:34:00.000Z	RAOF	r4nge	No, that's not true.  There'd be a fixed package in the feisty-security repository.
2007-05-16T13:35:00.000Z	RAOF	r4nge	Packages get security fixes always, and (simple) bugfixes generally.  But never (well, almost never) by using a new upstream version.
2007-05-16T13:35:00.000Z	r4nge	RAOF	thanks for clearing it up
2007-05-16T13:36:00.000Z	RAOF	r4nge	You might want to ask jdong and the backports team to backport the package you're after, though.
