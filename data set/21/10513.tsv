2005-02-12T14:17:00.000Z	liquid		whats the command to move one folder to another one in the terminal?
2005-02-12T14:18:00.000Z	paer	liquid	mv folder to_another_folder/
2005-02-12T14:19:00.000Z	paer	liquid	yep pretty much that. you may have to have a look at the "-r" option, though
2005-02-12T14:22:00.000Z	paer	liquid	cp -r /mnt/hdb5/bin /mnt/
2005-02-12T14:23:00.000Z	liquid	paer	what does the -r do, i think i missed that part
2005-02-12T14:23:00.000Z	paer	liquid	it copies subfolders too
2005-02-12T14:28:00.000Z	liquid	paer	will it just sit there untill its done (its over a gigs worth of stuff that im shifting) ?
2005-02-12T14:28:00.000Z	liquid	paer	cos it doesnt sound like its doing anything
2005-02-12T14:28:00.000Z	paer	liquid	yep it will.
2005-02-12T14:28:00.000Z	paer	liquid	log in to another terminal window and do a df -h
2005-02-12T14:29:00.000Z	paer	liquid	then wait some and do another one, and watch if the size has changed. if it has, you're copying :o)
2005-02-12T14:29:00.000Z	paer	liquid	what does it say?
2005-02-12T14:30:00.000Z	liquid	paer	then wait some and do another one, and watch
2005-02-12T14:30:00.000Z	paer	liquid	hehe no u didn't :o)
2005-02-12T14:30:00.000Z	liquid	paer	cp: cannot create directory `/mnt/sda1/files/audacity/voice samples_data': Input/output error
2005-02-12T14:31:00.000Z	liquid	paer	im on a live cd, if that makes a difference
2005-02-12T14:31:00.000Z	paer	liquid	i have no idea about the live cd. maybe you're trying to copy to cd? that may not work...
2005-02-12T14:32:00.000Z	paer	liquid	ok. maybe there is some problems with the usb driver?
2005-02-12T14:33:00.000Z	paer	liquid	ok maybe the mounted disk was unmounted for some reason?
2005-02-12T14:33:00.000Z	liquid	paer	i dont see why.. :P
2005-02-12T14:34:00.000Z	paer	liquid	yep, that sounds smart. :o)
