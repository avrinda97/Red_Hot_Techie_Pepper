2011-11-25T13:41:00.000Z	maum		I think synaptic server is not good or.. something trouble..
2011-11-25T13:41:00.000Z	kanhiya	maum	Use ubuntu software center & install ffmpeg from there
2011-11-25T13:41:00.000Z	maum	kanhiya	I couldn't by it.
2011-11-25T13:41:00.000Z	kanhiya	maum	it will auto resolve dependenices
2011-11-25T13:42:00.000Z	maum	kanhiya	I am using ubuntu 11.04
2011-11-25T13:42:00.000Z	maum	kanhiya	ubuntu software center doesn't fix the dependencies...
2011-11-25T13:43:00.000Z	kanhiya	maum	go to the recovery option while booting  &  than try from there, to update software
2011-11-25T13:44:00.000Z	kanhiya	maum	this one worked for me sometimes
2011-11-25T13:45:00.000Z	maum	kanhiya	i don't know how and I am curious if I can fix this from recovery option
2011-11-25T13:47:00.000Z	kanhiya	maum	tell me if there is any message that synaptic packages are broken
2011-11-25T13:48:00.000Z	kanhiya	maum	also required repositry  is there in software sources
2011-11-25T13:50:00.000Z	kanhiya	maum	Use imagebin
