2006-02-19T15:10:00.000Z	keherman		how do i install all packages LIKE "foo-1 foo-2 foo-3" in one "foo-*" ???
2006-02-19T15:11:00.000Z	_jason	keherman	yeah, I think that works
2006-02-19T15:11:00.000Z	keherman	_jason	it does not
2006-02-19T15:12:00.000Z	_jason	keherman	I just tried it
2006-02-19T15:12:00.000Z	_jason	keherman	'sudo apt-get -s install gtk*' gave me a long list of selections
2006-02-19T15:13:00.000Z	keherman	_jason	but it does not install them!
2006-02-19T15:13:00.000Z	keherman	_jason	it gives you suggestions
2006-02-19T15:13:00.000Z	_jason	keherman	I don't think so, let me find something i can try without messing up my box
2006-02-19T15:13:00.000Z	keherman		r-cran-*
2006-02-19T15:14:00.000Z	_jason	keherman	that's a lot of stuff
2006-02-19T15:14:00.000Z	_jason	keherman	0 upgraded, 76 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
2006-02-19T15:15:00.000Z	keherman	_jason	how did you do it?
2006-02-19T15:15:00.000Z	_jason	keherman	how did you write the command?
2006-02-19T15:15:00.000Z	_jason	keherman	sudo apt-get -s install r-cran-*, you take off the '-s' since that means simulate
2006-02-19T15:15:00.000Z	keherman	_jason	aptitude install r-cran-* dfoes not work
2006-02-19T15:15:00.000Z	_jason	keherman	use apt-get, seems to work there
2006-02-19T15:16:00.000Z	keherman	_jason	i want to use aptitude!
2006-02-19T15:17:00.000Z	_jason	keherman	what's the difference!, you probably need to read man aptitude to see how it handles it then
2006-02-19T15:23:00.000Z	keherman		# aptitude install 'r-cran-~n' <-- '~n' is the wildcard for aptitude
2006-02-19T15:24:00.000Z	_jason	keherman	ah I see, seems dumb to me to introduce new schemes, but ok
2006-02-19T15:24:00.000Z	keherman	_jason	yeah * would be nicer
