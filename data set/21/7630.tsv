2010-10-08T14:23:00.000Z	Sanctusorium		I just installed Ubuntu and I want to set up a way to make my Windows 7 partition bootable with a virtual machine and also avaiable to boot into from start up.  Any ideas? :)
2010-10-08T14:24:00.000Z	ikonia	Sanctusorium	well, it's bootable from startup via grub, so no problems there
2010-10-08T14:24:00.000Z	ikonia	Sanctusorium	for inside a virtual machine, use kvm, or vmware and specify the disk image as your windows partition, and it will boot
2010-10-08T14:24:00.000Z	ikonia	Sanctusorium	it's that simple
2010-10-08T14:26:00.000Z	Sanctusorium	ikonia	VMware only give me the option of picking ISOs for disk images... =/
2010-10-08T14:26:00.000Z	ikonia	Sanctusorium	that's install media
2010-10-08T14:26:00.000Z	ikonia	Sanctusorium	use kvm then, it works fine here, I use it all the time
2010-10-08T14:32:00.000Z	Sanctusorium	ikonia	on the KVM install page, it says its assuming I am using a server with no X.  How will the fact that I am NOT using a server and DO have X installed change this install guide?
2010-10-08T14:32:00.000Z	ikonia	Sanctusorium	nothing
2010-10-08T14:32:00.000Z	ikonia	Sanctusorium	it's easier with X as you can use the libvirt gui
2010-10-08T14:49:00.000Z	Sanctusorium	ikonia	I got KVM installed with the GUI, but its still not giving me an option to open a already installed OS file system.  I got using local media and through a network.
2010-10-08T14:50:00.000Z	ikonia	Sanctusorium	that's install media options, you don't want to do an install
2010-10-08T14:51:00.000Z	ikonia	Sanctusorium	create a disk image, and instead of using a disk image, select your partition on the real physical disk
2010-10-08T14:51:00.000Z	ikonia	Sanctusorium	you won't need to install then, just power on the VM
2010-10-08T14:53:00.000Z	Sanctusorium	ikonia	is this making a copy of the WIndows install?
2010-10-08T14:53:00.000Z	ikonia	Sanctusorium	no
2010-10-08T14:54:00.000Z	ikonia	Sanctusorium	you already have windows installed on a partition, tell the kvm machine to use that partition instead of a virual disk, and then power on the vm, it will boot from the physical partition
2010-10-08T14:54:00.000Z	ikonia	Sanctusorium	you don't need to create
2010-10-08T14:54:00.000Z	ikonia	Sanctusorium	you've got the install you want to use on the partition
2010-10-08T14:57:00.000Z	Sanctusorium	ikonia	Sorry if I am being completely oblivious, I am not seeing how to tell KVM to use the NTFS partition.  I am using the GUI for KVM made by Canocial
2010-10-08T14:58:00.000Z	ikonia	Sanctusorium	it asks you to make a file for the file system for the vm, point it at the partition
