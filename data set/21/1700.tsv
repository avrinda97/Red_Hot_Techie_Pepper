2011-08-14T14:41:00.000Z	Benkinooby		hi, i could use some help from a permission-wizard. when plugging in my pen drive, it get's auto mounted alight, but i don'T have write access :( root is the owner of the device instead of me... i checked out https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Mount/USB w/o luck
2011-08-14T14:42:00.000Z	llutz_	Benkinooby	create a udev-rule to change ownership
2011-08-14T14:44:00.000Z	llutz_	Benkinooby	like: SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0abc", ATTRS{idProduct} =="0xyz", OWNER="youruser", GROUP="yourgroup" , then " sudo udevadm control --reload-rules"
2011-08-14T14:45:00.000Z	Benkinooby	llutz_	i am just reading http://reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html but that a bit overwhelming... do i have to enter your caommnd just like that to the command line?
2011-08-14T14:46:00.000Z	llutz_	Benkinooby	nope, that is just an example for a file you put into /etc/udev/rules.d
2011-08-14T14:47:00.000Z	Benkinooby	llutz_	hm... i wonder who i could ever have messed up my udev rules
2011-08-14T14:49:00.000Z	Benkinooby	llutz_	if your automount is working fine and you et write permission you paste me "ls /etc/udev/rules.d" and "cat /etc/udev/rules.d/*"?
2011-08-14T14:52:00.000Z	llutz_	Benkinooby	there are no mount-related rules by default in
2011-08-14T14:54:00.000Z	Benkinooby	llutz_	on a fresh install usually writing on a mounted pen drive is possible... so i have changed something... but i never messed around with udev/ruels.d (directly) once i was on a "everything must be minimal"-trip and removed some services... might be that i am lacking one that fixes the permissions?
2011-08-14T14:55:00.000Z	Benkinooby	llutz_	is there a service that is responsible for fixing permissions?
2011-08-14T14:56:00.000Z	llutz_	Benkinooby	i dont know
2011-08-14T14:59:00.000Z	llutz_	Benkinooby	mind if i pm you? i don't have www for pastebin
2011-08-14T14:59:00.000Z	Benkinooby	llutz_	yeah, never mind
2011-08-14T15:00:00.000Z	llutz_	Benkinooby	idk, i usually refuse PMs ;)
2011-08-14T15:00:00.000Z	Benkinooby	llutz_	why?
2011-08-14T15:00:00.000Z	Benkinooby	llutz_	btw, i have the exact same result
2011-08-14T15:01:00.000Z	llutz_	Benkinooby	i give public support but not personal, so  no need to handle all those queries
2011-08-14T15:01:00.000Z	Benkinooby	llutz_	also you might have use for "pastebinit" it is in the reps and pastes textfiles to pastebin.com for you
2011-08-14T15:01:00.000Z	Benkinooby	llutz_	ah, ok
2011-08-14T15:02:00.000Z	llutz_	Benkinooby	i have pastebinit but no access to anything except my irc right now :)
2011-08-14T15:02:00.000Z	Benkinooby	llutz_	ok
