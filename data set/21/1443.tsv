2010-09-12T16:34:00.000Z	kronosphere		i wasn't suggesting you install, i'm new at this and thought you might be able to see something that i am missing
2010-09-12T16:34:00.000Z	theos	kronosphere	it wants you to install that software i think
2010-09-12T16:35:00.000Z	kronosphere	theos	but if i click on it, since this is ubuntu, i doubt that it is going to install, right?
2010-09-12T16:36:00.000Z	theos	kronosphere	yes. so why do you use any m$ product on ubuntu? :)
2010-09-12T16:36:00.000Z	kronosphere	theos	its just a lecture series on java programming at stanford university that i want to watch
2010-09-12T16:38:00.000Z	theos	kronosphere	the website says its a free plugin for ubuntu check it out--> http://go-mono.com/moonlight/
2010-09-12T16:41:00.000Z	kronosphere	theos	you are brilliant
2010-09-12T16:45:00.000Z	theos	kronosphere	you want those same videos on youtube?

2010-09-12T16:48:00.000Z	kronosphere	theos	how did you find that linux moonlight installation?
2010-09-12T16:50:00.000Z	kronosphere	theos	i'm asking for future reference, did you simply click on the moonlight link in order to find out that they had a linux version?
2010-09-12T16:50:00.000Z	theos	kronosphere	yes :)
