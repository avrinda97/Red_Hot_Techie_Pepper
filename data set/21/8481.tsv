2006-09-28T16:45:00.000Z	bdgraue	Dr_willis	that doesn't work
2006-09-28T16:45:00.000Z	Dr_willis	bdgraue	 check the game docs. it may be locking the display badly. What game is this?
2006-09-28T16:46:00.000Z	bdgraue	Dr_willis	cube
2006-09-28T16:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	bdgraue	 the update to cube i think is called 'sourbratten' or somthing like that.  it may have some improvements.
2006-09-28T16:46:00.000Z	bdgraue	Dr_willis	i use the "old" cube ;-)
