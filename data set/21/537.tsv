2011-11-23T19:35:00.000Z	phunyguy_work		ok, please help me.  This works on all of my other workstations, but one fully updated ubuntu 11.10 PC I can connect to via vino-server, and can see the screen, but I can't control the remote mouse or keyboard.  (NOT set to view only)
2011-11-23T19:35:00.000Z	phunyguy_work		any ideas?
2011-11-23T19:36:00.000Z	phunyguy_work		and here we go
2011-11-23T19:38:00.000Z	phunyguy_work		fantastic
2011-11-23T19:38:00.000Z	phunyguy_work		thanks
2011-11-23T19:38:00.000Z	phunyguy_work		(sorry for the repost, my original rolled off the screen quickly thanks to Floodman): ok, please help me.  This works on all of my other workstations, but one fully updated ubuntu 11.10 PC I can connect to via vino-server, and can see the screen, but I can't control the remote mouse or keyboard.

2011-11-23T19:40:00.000Z	yeats	phunyguy_work	I would try to run it via the command line to see what error messages are generated (that or look for a log that it may be logging to)
2011-11-23T19:40:00.000Z	phunyguy_work	yeats	i would if I could, but I even forgot to install SSH on taht workstation
2011-11-23T19:40:00.000Z	phunyguy_work		that*
2011-11-23T19:40:00.000Z	yeats	phunyguy_work	do you not have physical access to the machine?
2011-11-23T19:40:00.000Z	phunyguy_work	yeats	not at the moment
2011-11-23T19:40:00.000Z	phunyguy_work		i can see the screen but can't do anything...
2011-11-23T19:41:00.000Z	phunyguy_work		(remotely)
2011-11-23T19:41:00.000Z	yeats	phunyguy_work	what about from the client end?
2011-11-23T19:41:00.000Z	phunyguy_work	yeats	i can't ssh, but I can VNC, and can't control the desktop
2011-11-23T19:42:00.000Z	yeats	phunyguy_work	what I'm saying is, can you run the program you're using to access the desktop from the command line to see if there are errors? (this is the only way I know to troubleshoot this kind of thing)
2011-11-23T19:43:00.000Z	phunyguy_work		aww dangit.  I see the issue.  the config on the server end must be set to not allow control
2011-11-23T19:43:00.000Z	phunyguy_work		because the popup on the server end says that someone is "viewing" not controlling
2011-11-23T19:43:00.000Z	phunyguy_work		><
2011-11-23T19:44:00.000Z	phunyguy_work		so yeats, am I boned?
2011-11-23T19:44:00.000Z	yeats	phunyguy_work	I can't think of a way you can get to the machine remotely, if that's what you mean
