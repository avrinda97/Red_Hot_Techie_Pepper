2010-11-24T00:17:00.000Z	gladiator		are there any utilities to repair any failing filesystems / bad sectors?
2010-11-24T00:18:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	gladiator	there is fsck
2010-11-24T00:20:00.000Z	gladiator	shane4ubuntu	sosaited "unable to locate package fsck" 10.10. sosaited im not able to back up files. that drive was my backup drive before installing ubuntu
2010-11-24T00:20:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	gladiator	fsck is installed automagically on all installs, it is part of the system.
2010-11-24T00:23:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	gladiator	do you know what type of partition it is?  ext3 ext4, fat32, ntfs, reiserFS?
2010-11-24T00:24:00.000Z	gladiator	shane4ubuntu	it says fat32. but im not sure .. it may have been ntfs also ..
2010-11-24T00:24:00.000Z	gladiator	shane4ubuntu	but in any event, it doesnt mount. whether i try vfat or ntfs-3g
2010-11-24T00:25:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	gladiator	ok, what happened that it quit?  I mean partitions don't just quit.
2010-11-24T00:26:00.000Z	gladiator	shane4ubuntu	i formatted old partitions. made new ones. installed ubuntu. let this particular partition as it is. this partition was my back up partition.
2010-11-24T00:27:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	gladiator	ok, because usually those problems happen because a partition table is messed up
2010-11-24T00:27:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	gladiator	if you messed with partitions, what tool did you use?
2010-11-24T00:28:00.000Z	gladiator	shane4ubuntu	that may be the case. i wouldnt know. i used the default partitioner that came with the ubuntu installer
2010-11-24T00:28:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	gladiator	ok, let me google, I know there is a way to try and restore partition tables, but it is hmm, risky.
2010-11-24T00:30:00.000Z	gladiator	shane4ubuntu	risky as in bricking the disk risky? or losing the data risky?
2010-11-24T00:31:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	gladiator	risky as looging data
2010-11-24T00:31:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	gladiator	loosing*
2010-11-24T00:31:00.000Z	gladiator	shane4ubuntu	im already at that.. if i cant recover it the data is already lost ..
2010-11-24T00:32:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	gladiator	actually it could be recovered, using foremost, and scalpel,
2010-11-24T00:33:00.000Z	gladiator	shane4ubuntu	ok. let me try those ..
2010-11-24T00:33:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	gladiator	ok, here is a link:  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=370121
2010-11-24T00:33:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	gladiator	if you can recover the partition table, that would be the best, if you can't recover that then you can use foremost, and scalpel
