2005-06-02T09:53:00.000Z	Seveas	Tsingi	do not use the dev release, use the stable
2005-06-02T09:38:00.000Z	Seveas	Tsingi	if you want c#/mono development, you'd better wait for the next ubuntu version
2005-06-02T09:39:00.000Z	Seveas	Tsingi	what are the specs of your laptop (cpu/mem/gpu/wifi)
2005-06-02T09:39:00.000Z	Seveas	Tsingi	ubuntu has been reported a lot of times to wirk fine on laptops. On my laptops (hp and medion) it works like a charm
2005-06-02T09:40:00.000Z	Seveas	Tsingi	if you are going to buy one with wifi: stay clear of broadcom wifi chips!
2005-06-02T09:41:00.000Z	Seveas	Tsingi	atherors/prism/intel/ndiswrapper (so all cards) work fine
2005-06-02T09:42:00.000Z	Seveas	Tsingi	waiting for the next version is only if you use .net/c#/mono
2005-06-02T09:44:00.000Z	Seveas	Tsingi	thinkpads will work, tsee wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTesting for more info
2005-06-02T09:46:00.000Z	Seveas	Tsingi	since the invention of NPTL threading is OK to use :)
2005-06-02T09:46:00.000Z	Tsingi	Seveas	yeah, I use them but you have to change the way you write your code, so not for the uninitiated.
2005-06-02T09:48:00.000Z	Seveas	Tsingi	grab an install cd image and once you have it installed, run apt-get install build-essential manpages-dev manpages-posix-dev
2005-06-02T09:48:00.000Z	Seveas	Tsingi	yes
2005-06-02T09:50:00.000Z	Seveas	Tsingi	1
