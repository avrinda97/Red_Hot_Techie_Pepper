2006-02-26T11:35:00.000Z	StucKman	ucenik	how are you connected to the inet?
2006-02-26T11:36:00.000Z	StucKman	ucenik	modem, lan, dsl or similar...?
2006-02-26T11:36:00.000Z	StucKman	ucenik	pppoe?
2006-02-26T11:36:00.000Z	StucKman	ucenik	sudo aptitude install pppoe-config
2006-02-26T11:37:00.000Z	StucKman	ucenik	ok, do you use synaptics?
2006-02-26T11:37:00.000Z	StucKman	ucenik	how do you install software in your ubuntu?
2006-02-26T11:38:00.000Z	StucKman	ucenik	ok, is your desktop `up and running'?
2006-02-26T11:48:00.000Z	StucKman	ucenik	ok, so, boot on your desktop, select System -> Admin -> something synaptics. that's the package manager. search for pppoe-config and install it. then open a terminal, and run sudo pppoe-config. I guess that's all
2006-02-26T11:51:00.000Z	StucKman	ucenik	with a little of luck, from the cd
2006-02-26T11:55:00.000Z	StucKman	ucenik	well... most virus won't affect you. per default it has no firewall, but not much servers running either. and you can fall into phishing with any browser. so I guess that, except for most virus and troyans, you're as secure as in any other platform. *but*, most security problems come from virus and trojans.
2006-02-26T11:56:00.000Z	StucKman	ucenik	so I guess the short answer is: safer than *that* other platform, as safe as any *nix like
2006-02-26T11:57:00.000Z	StucKman	ucenik	as I said, most virus won't affect you. and when I say most, I'm talking abount 99.999 and some more 9's % of them
2006-02-26T11:57:00.000Z	StucKman	ucenik	about firewalls... well, having one won't hurt you.
2006-02-26T12:04:00.000Z	StucKman	ucenik	well, 5.04 it's from april 2005. there was another release october 2005 and another will come in april 2006
