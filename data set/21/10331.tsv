2005-04-01T10:28:00.000Z	viZion2		ok with only console, it doesnt work
2005-04-01T10:29:00.000Z	viZion2		when starting up linux, when it stats the ALSA, i do hear a plop on my speakers so it seems to load?
2005-04-01T10:30:00.000Z	viZion2		no sound...
2005-04-01T10:30:00.000Z	rapha_	viZion2	I'm going to try out what crimsun earlier suggested now, and see if that helps with our sound
2005-04-01T10:33:00.000Z	viZion2	rapha_	what is your specific problem?
2005-04-01T10:34:00.000Z	rapha_	viZion2	we spoke about it before. Since Hoary I have no audible sound output anymore, even though everything looks like it was working, except that gstreamer can't build an ALSA pipe.
2005-04-01T10:35:00.000Z	viZion2	rapha_	seems like same problem
2005-04-01T10:35:00.000Z	rapha_	viZion2	Like I said, you and I have talked about it just a couple of hours ago
2005-04-01T10:35:00.000Z	viZion2	rapha_	System -> Prefrences -> Multimedia Systems Selection
2005-04-01T10:36:00.000Z	rapha_	viZion2	I know
2005-04-01T10:36:00.000Z	viZion2	rapha_	what tests do work?? with you
2005-04-01T10:36:00.000Z	rapha_	viZion2	just OSS
2005-04-01T10:41:00.000Z	viZion2	rapha_	making any progress?
2005-04-01T11:22:00.000Z	rapha_	viZion2	crimsun: Rebuilding ALSA didn't help.
2005-04-01T11:55:00.000Z	viZion2	rapha_	didnt find a solution?
2005-04-01T11:55:00.000Z	rapha_	viZion2	As I said, even recompiling didn't help
2005-04-01T11:56:00.000Z	rapha_	viZion2	Kind of like that, yes.
2005-04-01T12:02:00.000Z	viZion2	rapha_	posted the bugreport yet?
2005-04-01T12:04:00.000Z	rapha_	viZion2	No, I'm reading through the existing ones right now. One suggest to try to boot with `noapic' which I'm gonna do now.
2005-04-01T12:30:00.000Z	viZion2	rapha_	its working :D
2005-04-01T12:34:00.000Z	rapha_	viZion2	What did you do?
