2009-07-05T15:16:00.000Z	papul		got error while compiling thunderbird "configure: error: --enable-application=APP is required"
2009-07-05T15:17:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	papul	If you can't figure that out yourself, maybe buiilding it yourself isn't the path you should follow?
2009-07-05T15:17:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	papul	sudo apt-get install thunderbird may be more your speed.
2009-07-05T15:17:00.000Z	papul	KB1JWQ	but i want to compile it
2009-07-05T15:18:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	papul	why?
2009-07-05T15:18:00.000Z	papul	KB1JWQ	just wanna learn
2009-07-05T15:18:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	papul	THen go learn; presumably on a package with fewer dependencies. But begging for help in IRC isn't "learning" by any stretch,
2009-07-05T15:19:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	papul	Just for my own curiosity, what's your configure line?
2009-07-05T15:19:00.000Z	papul	KB1JWQ	./ configure --enable-application=APP
2009-07-05T15:20:00.000Z	papul	KB1JWQ	./configure --enable-application=APP
2009-07-05T15:20:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	papul	sudo apt-get install thunderbird
2009-07-05T15:22:00.000Z	papul	KB1JWQ	will that not work
2009-07-05T15:23:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	papul	Read the documentation.
2009-07-05T15:24:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	papul	./configure; make; make install isn't how you install Thunderbird.
2009-07-05T15:24:00.000Z	papul	KB1JWQ	then how do i install it
2009-07-05T15:24:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	papul	Once again, read the documentation.
2009-07-05T15:24:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	papul	It took me fifteen seconds of googling to figure that out.
2009-07-05T15:24:00.000Z	papul	KB1JWQ	readme?
