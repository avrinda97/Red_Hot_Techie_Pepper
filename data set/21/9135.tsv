2005-12-08T17:57:00.000Z	mifritscher		he means that the files could be internly corrupted, not the file system structures I think
2005-12-08T17:58:00.000Z	mifritscher		but in 99% only files that were changed in this moment can be crrupt
2005-12-08T17:59:00.000Z	mifritscher		but you have savd the fsck-log, don't you ;)
2005-12-08T17:59:00.000Z	mifritscher		if it's was during booting look into messages or syslog
2005-12-08T06:00:00.000Z	HeMan	mifritscher	i had to boot into singleuser and i rebooted
2005-12-08T06:00:00.000Z	mifritscher		not good :(
2005-12-08T06:01:00.000Z	HeMan		what i want is to ask dpkg or apt to check all the files installed against checksums in the database, how do i do that?
2005-12-08T06:01:00.000Z	HeMan		i assume that the package database contains that information
2005-12-08T06:01:00.000Z	mifritscher		hmm
2005-12-08T06:02:00.000Z	mifritscher	HeMan	it could only corrupt the files you changed right i that moment
2005-12-08T06:02:00.000Z	mifritscher		+n
2005-12-08T06:03:00.000Z	HeMan	mifritscher	if my harddrive is working and is not broken, but since i'm not sure it is working i'd like to check everything
2005-12-08T06:04:00.000Z	mifritscher	HeMan	so you think you have hardware failure?
2005-12-08T06:04:00.000Z	HeMan		just like i can do with "rpm -Va" on rpm-based instalations
2005-12-08T06:05:00.000Z	mifritscher		but this way you could only check ca. 40-50%
2005-12-08T06:05:00.000Z	HeMan	mifritscher	i'm downloading smartmontools to se what the harddrive say
2005-12-08T06:05:00.000Z	mifritscher		ok
2005-12-08T06:05:00.000Z	HeMan		don't the package database contain _any_ checksums?
2005-12-08T06:06:00.000Z	mifritscher		a simple test is dd if=/dev/hdx of=/dev/null
2005-12-08T06:06:00.000Z	mifritscher		if it can read all blocks all should be ok
2005-12-08T06:06:00.000Z	HeMan	mifritscher	it still doesn't tell me if any files are corrupt
