2007-04-25T11:06:00.000Z	Blubloblu		Anybody want to help me? I'm reinstalling Feisty from scratch after many problems, but I fear one may remain. Feisty doesn't recognize my Belkin Wireless G usb adapter, it worked fine in Edgy, but now it just doesnt work. Can someone give me a simple way to make it work?
2007-04-25T11:06:00.000Z	sipior	Blubloblu	did you need to do anything special in edgy for it to work?
2007-04-25T11:06:00.000Z	Blubloblu	sipior	no
2007-04-25T11:06:00.000Z	sipior	Blubloblu	and you're using network manager?
2007-04-25T11:06:00.000Z	Blubloblu	sipior	I just plugged it in, typed in my ESSID, and off it went
2007-04-25T11:07:00.000Z	Blubloblu	sipior	yeah, the default feisty one
2007-04-25T11:07:00.000Z	sipior	Blubloblu	when you insert the adapter, are there any warnings left in your log files?
2007-04-25T11:07:00.000Z	Blubloblu	sipior	in dmesg there are a few messages
2007-04-25T11:08:00.000Z	sipior	Blubloblu	which say?
2007-04-25T11:08:00.000Z	Blubloblu	sipior	and if im on tty1 it says something about registry busy
2007-04-25T11:08:00.000Z	Blubloblu	sipior	I posted it all on the ubuntu forums, I'll find the link

2007-04-25T11:10:00.000Z	sipior	Blubloblu	is that the same driver that was used under Edgy? the rt73usb i mean
2007-04-25T11:11:00.000Z	Blubloblu	sipior	I assume, I didn't touch anything to do with drivers
2007-04-25T11:13:00.000Z	sipior	Blubloblu	check out this bug report, and se if it doesn't look familiar: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.20/+bug/92931
2007-04-25T11:14:00.000Z	Blubloblu	sipior	similar, yes
2007-04-25T11:15:00.000Z	sipior	Blubloblu	check to see if you're running the mentioned kernel version. if so, you have two options: roll your own kernel, or wait for the fix (the report says a fix is committed, which is good news anyway)
2007-04-25T11:15:00.000Z	Blubloblu	sipior	roll my own kernel?
2007-04-25T11:16:00.000Z	sipior	Blubloblu	why not? it's one option. or wait for someone else to do it, as you like.
2007-04-25T11:16:00.000Z	Blubloblu	sipior	I suppose, thanks anyway
2007-04-25T11:16:00.000Z	sipior	Blubloblu	yup
