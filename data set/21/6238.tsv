2007-05-09T13:34:00.000Z	rukuartic	HKJGN_	Possibly, possibly not.
2007-05-09T13:38:00.000Z	HKJGN_	rukuartic	its not that my sound /wasnt/ working, it just stopped working, and ive closed any apps that could have been using my soundcard
2007-05-09T13:39:00.000Z	rukuartic	HKJGN_	I'm no audio wiz... but what happens when you try "play somefile.wav" or "mpg123 somefile.mp3"?
2007-05-09T13:40:00.000Z	HKJGN_	rukuartic	in XMMS it says "couldnt open audio, please check that its configured properly, the correct output plugin is selected, and no other program is blocking the soundcard
2007-05-09T13:40:00.000Z	HKJGN_	rukuartic	but... i did all that XD
2007-05-09T13:40:00.000Z	rukuartic	HKJGN_	Sounds like you're having audio conflicts... I think... try apt-get install alsa-oss and then "aoss xmms"
2007-05-09T13:41:00.000Z	rukuartic	HKJGN_	or just use alsa instead of oss...
2007-05-09T13:41:00.000Z	HKJGN_	rukuartic	i think i just crashed Alsa, i was on youtube, and was working fine, then poof
2007-05-09T13:41:00.000Z	rukuartic	HKJGN_	Oh, then it might be a flash thingy... there's something in about:config... look around for flash firefox linux sound on google or somethin'.
2007-05-09T13:42:00.000Z	HKJGN_	rukuartic	were is about:config? if you don't mind me asking ^^;;
2007-05-09T13:43:00.000Z	rukuartic	HKJGN_	I think this might help... http://www.macewan.org/2006/06/01/howto-firefox-flash-video-sound-on-ubuntu-linux-dapper/
2007-05-09T13:43:00.000Z	rukuartic	HKJGN_	No clue. I'm not a sound buff. I just know I've had better luck with alsa than OSS
2007-05-09T13:45:00.000Z	HKJGN_	rukuartic	no.. that didnt help, ill just try relogging
2007-05-09T13:45:00.000Z	rukuartic	HKJGN_	Try a reboot too :P
