2012-03-11T14:12:00.000Z	sisar		so i noticed this on my friends computer, pressing the down arrow key in the terminal makes a 'dang' sound, but i don't have any such sound in my terminal, what is the problem ?
2012-03-11T14:13:00.000Z	pfifo	sisar	are you sure your PC actually has a bell?
2012-03-11T14:13:00.000Z	sisar	pfifo	i don't know. how can i find out?
2012-03-11T14:14:00.000Z	pfifo	sisar	try `sudo modprobe pcspkr`
2012-03-11T14:15:00.000Z	pfifo	sisar	then press ctrl+g in a terminal, it might trigger the bell
2012-03-11T14:16:00.000Z	sisar	pfifo	no bell sound heard
2012-03-11T14:16:00.000Z	sisar		what is 'ctrl+g' for ?
2012-03-11T14:17:00.000Z	pfifo		it insters the bell ascii character, or atleast its supposed to
2012-03-11T14:18:00.000Z	pfifo	sisar	you may be in the same position as me, I dont have a bell connected to my system so it triggers it, but theres no hardware to actually play the sound. Have you ever heard a bell come out of your computer? Like on boot up?
2012-03-11T14:19:00.000Z	sisar	pfifo	i don't think so. Actually i have Windows dual boot, maybe i can find out there if I actually have a bell or not ?
2012-03-11T14:20:00.000Z	pfifo	sisar	well all computers have a place to hook the bell, but since most people find the bell annoying, some manufacturers wont install one. the only way to know for sure is to open your case and look for one
2012-03-11T14:21:00.000Z	sisar		anyway i can trigger the bell in Windows XP ?
2012-03-11T14:22:00.000Z	pfifo	sisar	I have no Idea how windows implements the bell
2012-03-11T14:23:00.000Z	sisar	pfifo	oh, ok, no problem. Not a big deal anyway :)
2012-03-11T14:24:00.000Z	pfifo	sisar	if all else fails, there are softbells available that will play a bell sound through your soundcard
2012-03-11T14:25:00.000Z	sisar	pfifo	how would i use softbells ?
2012-03-11T14:26:00.000Z	pfifo		!info beep
2012-03-11T14:26:00.000Z	pfifo		!info softbeep
2012-03-11T14:26:00.000Z	pfifo		!info softbeep lucid
2012-03-11T14:27:00.000Z	pfifo		those are 2 options, there may be more packages if you search in the software center
2012-03-11T14:27:00.000Z	sisar	pfifo	ok. thanks :)
