2010-03-08T07:51:00.000Z	PeterT	airtonix	That's exactly my problem
2010-03-08T07:51:00.000Z	PeterT	airtonix	But I couldn't really understand the solution
2010-03-08T07:51:00.000Z	airtonix	PeterT	this is a ubuntu channel not a redhat channel
2010-03-08T07:51:00.000Z	PeterT	airtonix	Same problem, different OS
2010-03-08T07:51:00.000Z	airtonix	PeterT	so you not using ubuntu then?
2010-03-08T07:51:00.000Z	PeterT	airtonix	I am
2010-03-08T07:52:00.000Z	airtonix	PeterT	are you familiar with manager users and groups ?
2010-03-08T07:52:00.000Z	airtonix	PeterT	managing *
2010-03-08T07:52:00.000Z	PeterT	airtonix	No
2010-03-08T07:53:00.000Z	airtonix	PeterT	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AddUsersHowto
2010-03-08T07:53:00.000Z	PeterT	airtonix	I'm using SSH, that link is of no use to me
2010-03-08T07:53:00.000Z	airtonix	PeterT	not my problem. install links2
2010-03-08T07:53:00.000Z	PeterT	airtonix	Never mind, there is a command line part
2010-03-08T07:54:00.000Z	PeterT	airtonix	So, do I add the user to the group "tty" as instructed on the foruM
2010-03-08T07:55:00.000Z	airtonix	PeterT	no idea. i don't run game servers. but without a basic understanding of how to manipulate users and groups you're not going to get very far
2010-03-08T07:56:00.000Z	PeterT	airtonix	Thanks anyway
