2011-06-12T03:26:00.000Z	Maylow		does anyone know how to enable channels 12 and 13 on a broadcom wl adapter?
2011-06-12T03:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Maylow	you may need to use iwconfig to set the channel
2011-06-12T03:28:00.000Z	Maylow	ActionParsnip	there's a problem with the broadcom driver - it does not allow channels 12 and 13
2011-06-12T03:28:00.000Z	Maylow	ActionParsnip	it's something related to the region
2011-06-12T03:29:00.000Z	Maylow	ActionParsnip	12 and 13 are not allowed in the US
2011-06-12T03:29:00.000Z	Maylow	ActionParsnip	but are used in Europe
2011-06-12T03:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Maylow	I see, Wasn't aware of them (UK based here)
2011-06-12T03:30:00.000Z	Maylow	ActionParsnip	but I could not figure out how to make the driver accept the fact that I'm actually located in Europe
2011-06-12T03:30:00.000Z	Maylow	ActionParsnip	none of the recommendations I found in google worked for me
2011-06-12T03:33:00.000Z	Maylow	ActionParsnip	do you have channels 12 and 13 allowed on your system?
2011-06-12T03:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Maylow	not sure, I havent messed with it that much
2011-06-12T03:38:00.000Z	Maylow	ActionParsnip	a simple sudo iwlist eth1 channel (your wireless instead of eth1) will list all available channels
2011-06-12T03:39:00.000Z	Maylow	ActionParsnip	I'm asking, because if you have 12 and 13, I could ask where did you get your drivers :)
2011-06-12T03:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Maylow	i'm not at home to see, i'm at work so I can't check. Sorry
2011-06-12T03:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Maylow	let me check then
2011-06-12T03:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Maylow	i am ssh'd to my server
2011-06-12T03:43:00.000Z	Maylow	ActionParsnip	10x
2011-06-12T03:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Maylow	this is a mission. I purposefully crippled my wireless as I use wired on it now
2011-06-12T03:46:00.000Z	Maylow	ActionParsnip	I c
2011-06-12T03:46:00.000Z	Maylow	ActionParsnip	anyway, 10x :)
2011-06-12T03:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Maylow	brb
