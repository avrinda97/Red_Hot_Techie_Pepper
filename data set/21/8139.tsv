2007-05-24T10:28:00.000Z	Zambezi		I have a big problem. I can't use sudo at all! "sudo: timestamp too far in the future: May 24 20:25:39 2007" What can I do?
2007-05-24T10:28:00.000Z	Zambezi		I got the problem after MythTV installed a timeserver.
2007-05-24T10:29:00.000Z	sipior	Zambezi	try killing your timestamp with sudo -K
2007-05-24T10:31:00.000Z	Zambezi	sipior	Doesn't work.
2007-05-24T10:32:00.000Z	sipior	Zambezi	your time correct?
2007-05-24T10:32:00.000Z	Zambezi	sipior	Om the clock yes. And it worked just before install MythTV.
2007-05-24T10:32:00.000Z	sipior	Zambezi	you did "sudo -K" and then "sudo <whatever>"?
2007-05-24T10:33:00.000Z	Zambezi	sipior	I tried, but I get the same error.
2007-05-24T10:34:00.000Z	sipior	Zambezi	hmm...try lower-case k and see if that works
2007-05-24T10:34:00.000Z	sipior	Zambezi	also, can you log in separately as root?
2007-05-24T10:34:00.000Z	Zambezi	sipior	Samething.
2007-05-24T10:35:00.000Z	Zambezi	sipior	I locked root. It doesn't have a password.
2007-05-24T10:35:00.000Z	sipior	Zambezi	unfortunate
2007-05-24T10:35:00.000Z	sipior	Zambezi	rebooting should clear it, though one would of course prefer not too
2007-05-24T10:36:00.000Z	Zambezi	sipior	I don't want to reboot either and the daemon is installed so I'm not sure it helps.
2007-05-24T10:37:00.000Z	sipior	Zambezi	well, you can wait for the time to expire :)
2007-05-24T10:37:00.000Z	sipior	Zambezi	how far off is the clock?
2007-05-24T10:37:00.000Z	Zambezi	sipior	Two hours.
2007-05-24T10:38:00.000Z	Zambezi	sipior	The clock in the BIOS was wrong so I changed it. That migth have something to do with it, but as I could install Mythtv, I guess it's not the reason.
2007-05-24T10:38:00.000Z	sipior	Zambezi	well, the problem is the file /var/run/sudo/<username>, if you can get rid of that...
2007-05-24T10:41:00.000Z	Zambezi	sipior	ompaul I have a look at it right away.
