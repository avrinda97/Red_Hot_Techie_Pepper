2008-01-05T17:18:00.000Z	Rudd-O		hello guys
2008-01-05T17:19:00.000Z	Rudd-O		I'm trying to get pulseaudio 0.9.8 for hardy, but compiled on gutsy
2008-01-05T17:19:00.000Z	Rudd-O		how do I find the source deb package to recompile? and how do I recompile it?
2008-01-05T17:19:00.000Z	Rudd-O		where
2008-01-05T17:19:00.000Z	Rudd-O		and how
2008-01-05T17:19:00.000Z	Rudd-O		I use GUTSY not hardy
2008-01-05T17:19:00.000Z	Rudd-O		plus ubuntu+1 is empty
2008-01-05T17:20:00.000Z	PriceChild	Rudd-O	we give suppose for gutsy here. not gutsy and hardy packages, gutsy.
2008-01-05T17:20:00.000Z	Rudd-O	PriceChild	I don't want gutsy support, I want a hyperlink where I can download the source package for gutsy, and maybe instructions on how to build a deb
2008-01-05T17:20:00.000Z	Rudd-O		replace gutsy for hardy in that sntence
2008-01-05T17:20:00.000Z	Rudd-O		I run gutsy here
2008-01-05T17:21:00.000Z	PriceChild	Rudd-O	so why mention hardy?
2008-01-05T17:21:00.000Z	PriceChild	Rudd-O	apt-get source <packagename>
2008-01-05T17:21:00.000Z	Rudd-O	PriceChild	just because I want to be accurate that I want the PA source package for hardy
2008-01-05T17:21:00.000Z	PriceChild	Rudd-O	add a -b for it to build automatically for YOU
2008-01-05T17:21:00.000Z	Rudd-O	PriceChild	apt-get source won't work because I only have the gutsy repos in my machine
2008-01-05T17:21:00.000Z	PriceChild		gah caps
2008-01-05T17:22:00.000Z	PriceChild	Rudd-O	packages.ubuntu.com then
2008-01-05T17:22:00.000Z	Rudd-O		and I don't want to ad the hardy repos because I'm happy with gutsy
2008-01-05T17:22:00.000Z	PriceChild	Rudd-O	or add the gutsy repo
2008-01-05T17:22:00.000Z	Rudd-O	PriceChild	thanks
