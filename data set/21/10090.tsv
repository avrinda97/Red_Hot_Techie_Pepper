2005-05-16T16:21:00.000Z	Muffie		nite all
2005-05-16T16:22:00.000Z	Muffie		I have used sudo apt-get install fglrx... But glxinfo | grep direct keeps me showing that Direct rendering is not active. What else should I do?
2005-05-16T16:23:00.000Z	eddyp	Muffie	modify the xorg.conf
2005-05-16T16:23:00.000Z	Muffie	eddyp	Ok, but I dont need to start fglrx module? lsmod does not show it
2005-05-16T16:23:00.000Z	eddyp	Muffie	that, too
2005-05-16T16:23:00.000Z	Muffie	eddyp	How can I do that?
2005-05-16T16:24:00.000Z	Muffie	eddyp	is there a HOWto somewhere?
2005-05-16T16:24:00.000Z	eddyp	Muffie	modprobe fgfx
2005-05-16T16:26:00.000Z	Muffie	eddyp	and to set it to automatically start in boot?
2005-05-16T16:26:00.000Z	eddyp	Muffie	edit /etc/modules
2005-05-16T16:26:00.000Z	eddyp	Muffie	add it there
2005-05-16T16:26:00.000Z	Muffie	eddyp	Nice. Thanks! :)
2005-05-16T16:27:00.000Z	eddyp	Muffie	maybe there is a ubuntu--click-click-way of doing that, but I am a Debian user
2005-05-16T16:28:00.000Z	Muffie	eddyp	Ok. I preffer this way. Im using Gentoo and Ubuntu on the Desktop. Debian Sarge on my server!
2005-05-16T16:29:00.000Z	eddyp	Muffie	:)
2005-05-16T16:29:00.000Z	eddyp	Muffie	I thought you were a rookie
2005-05-16T16:29:00.000Z	Muffie	eddyp	Newbie in Linux.
2005-05-16T16:30:00.000Z	eddyp	Muffie	damn, that is wack!
2005-05-16T16:31:00.000Z	Muffie	eddyp	Is it possible to put more than 4 primary partitions in a disk?
2005-05-16T16:31:00.000Z	eddyp	Muffie	not on i386, but you can use logical ones, why would you need more than 4?
2005-05-16T16:32:00.000Z	Muffie	eddyp	My gentoo uses 3: SWAP, BOOT and /. The Window partition takes the fourth. Ubuntu is on the second disk...
