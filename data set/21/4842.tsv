2008-02-08T23:44:00.000Z	peleg	pepperjack	thanks
2008-02-08T23:44:00.000Z	pepperjack	peleg	id create a new user and see if they have the problem if they do not worst case you rm -fr the .g directories in your home or something
2008-02-08T23:45:00.000Z	peleg	pepperjack	adduser someone ?
2008-02-08T23:45:00.000Z	pepperjack	peleg	yeah
2008-02-08T23:46:00.000Z	peleg	pepperjack	thanks. I go now, maybe back soon.
2008-02-08T23:49:00.000Z	peleg	pepperjack	thanks, Now I'm logged as a new user. What have you suggested to check now?
2008-02-08T23:50:00.000Z	pepperjack	peleg	so only your original user has the problem?
2008-02-08T23:50:00.000Z	peleg	pepperjack	seems so.
2008-02-08T23:51:00.000Z	pepperjack	peleg	su - originaluser   then rm -fr ~/.g* but  this will completely set your gnome environment back to default so you lose shortcuts and everything is new again. its part of my 'take a mallot to it' approach to problem solving
2008-02-08T23:52:00.000Z	pepperjack	peleg	so maybe just mv ~/.gconf ~/.gconf-old  etc instead
2008-02-08T23:53:00.000Z	peleg	pepperjack	can you explain me more precisely what will be deleted/moved? I don't have any shortcuts: only the main menu, and an empty desktop. I DO have a huge amount of preferences (like language/keyboard/etc...)
2008-02-08T23:54:00.000Z	pepperjack	peleg	arg ignore me i thought you were a previous question. DO NOT do that
2008-02-08T23:54:00.000Z	peleg	pepperjack	ok.... :-)
2008-02-08T23:54:00.000Z	pepperjack	peleg	or do it if you want since itll fix it but id just instead use the xmod* command to run at login
2008-02-08T23:55:00.000Z	peleg	pepperjack	what is xmod* ?
2008-02-08T23:56:00.000Z	pepperjack	peleg	i dont have a gnome box to look at so id try mv ~/.gconf ~/.gconf-bak  as that user and logout/in see if it works
2008-02-08T23:57:00.000Z	peleg	pepperjack	thanks. What exactly is the command for being a different user? su what?
2008-02-08T23:59:00.000Z	pepperjack	peleg	su - user or just su user really
2008-02-08T23:59:00.000Z	peleg	pepperjack	thanks, hopefully be-right-back
2008-02-09T00:18:00.000Z	peleg	pepperjack	worked; I have copied most of .gconf-bak to .gconf, except for one tmp file, and now it works. Thanks! ;-)
