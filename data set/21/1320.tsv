2010-11-07T07:36:00.000Z	OY1R		i just installed ubuntu 10-04 but i have some issues with the second monitor it's flickering (waves scrolling don the screen) grapic card is ati x1400
2010-11-07T07:37:00.000Z	MagusOTB	OY1R	are you using the fglrx driver?
2010-11-07T07:37:00.000Z	OY1R	MagusOTB	i use what Ubuntu comes with, i have not changed anything
2010-11-07T07:38:00.000Z	MagusOTB	OY1R	try enabling the fglrx driver in system-> administration -> restricted drivers
2010-11-07T07:38:00.000Z	MagusOTB	OY1R	you might have to reboot a couple times after enabling it.
2010-11-07T07:39:00.000Z	OY1R	MagusOTB	i tried changing the Hz and the res but it didnt change.
2010-11-07T07:40:00.000Z	OY1R	MagusOTB	it says no proprietary drivers are in use on this system
2010-11-07T07:40:00.000Z	MagusOTB	OY1R	does it give you the option to use them?
2010-11-07T07:40:00.000Z	OY1R	MagusOTB	No the list is empty
2010-11-07T07:40:00.000Z	OY1R	MagusOTB	and "Enable" is grayed out
2010-11-07T07:41:00.000Z	MagusOTB	OY1R	and you have an ATI card?

2010-11-07T07:44:00.000Z	MagusOTB	OY1R	huh... that's odd. You might have to add multiverse to your package sources.. I forget where the thing that lets you change package sources is, but I'm sure somebody in here would know
2010-11-07T07:54:00.000Z	OY1R	MagusOTB	seems like multiverse is enabled by default, running the update tool atm see what that does.
2010-11-07T07:54:00.000Z	MagusOTB	OY1R	I think it might have been changed to partners. I'm not sure why it wouldn't give you the option to turn on the fglrx driver in that screen. Unless there's somethign special about the X series.
2010-11-07T07:56:00.000Z	OY1R	MagusOTB	i will check after the update i have about 140mb to dl and update. perhaps it will sort it self, knock on wood.
2010-11-07T08:35:00.000Z	OY1R	MagusOTB	this is what the second screen anomaly looks like -> http://imagebin.ca/view/p9muFKz.html
2010-11-07T08:44:00.000Z	MagusOTB	OY1R	that looks like your hsync is off or your driver is mapping the screen wrong. The latter would happen if your machine thinks you hagve a different card than you do or id your card is broken
2010-11-07T08:44:00.000Z	MagusOTB	OY1R	You should probably install the FGLRX driver, I'm not sure why you can't though.
2010-11-07T08:54:00.000Z	MagusOTB	OY1R	when I do that, it sticks at the highest
2010-11-07T08:54:00.000Z	OY1R	MagusOTB	it does the opposite here
