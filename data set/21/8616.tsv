2012-03-10T21:34:00.000Z	victor__		Installing the most recent appriopriate nvidia drivers
2012-03-10T21:34:00.000Z	victor__		Since the generic ones did not support opengl
2012-03-10T21:34:00.000Z	victor__		for my card, atleast

2012-03-10T21:35:00.000Z	victor__		Oh.. allright velko, thanks. i'll double check askubuntu.com dr_willis :)
2012-03-10T21:36:00.000Z	dr_willis	victor__	 ive seen way to many people have issues when trying the 'latest' nvidia driver installer.
2012-03-10T21:34:00.000Z	dr_willis	victor__	 yes.. what are you trying to do exactly?
2012-03-10T21:35:00.000Z	dr_willis	victor__	 you may want to look for some guides on askubuntu.com about using the latest.
2012-03-10T21:49:00.000Z	dr_willis	victor__	 what release of ubuntu are you using?
2012-03-10T21:49:00.000Z	victor__	dr_willis	 11.10 desktop x64
2012-03-10T21:49:00.000Z	dr_willis	victor__	 its using lightdm  is the reason. :) not gdm
2012-03-10T22:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	victor__	 not really.
2012-03-10T22:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	victor__	 try 'startx' and see if any errors appear
2012-03-10T22:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	victor__	 the xorg.conf is the least of your worries.. if the nvidia's .run installer failed to work.. theres really not a lot i know of to do.
2012-03-10T22:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	victor__	 what is your video card?
2012-03-10T22:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	victor__	 you may want to check askubuntu.com for suggestsions. they may know a way to get them going.
