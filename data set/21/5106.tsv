2007-12-23T17:22:00.000Z	AceOfSpades		awk '{print $1}' screen -ls | grep DALnet <---- it says cannot open screen (no such file of directory)
2007-12-23T17:23:00.000Z	Fujitsu	AceOfSpades	Perhaps you want `screen -ls | awk...'?
2007-12-23T17:25:00.000Z	AceOfSpades	Fujitsu	Can I use the output from awk to another command?
2007-12-23T17:25:00.000Z	Fujitsu	AceOfSpades	Yes. `screen -ls | awk '{print $1}' | grep DALnet' should do what6 you want.
2007-12-23T17:26:00.000Z	AceOfSpades	Fujitsu	screen -ls | grep DALnet | cut -f1 -d '.' | kill awk '{print $1}' <--- This is what I'm trying...
2007-12-23T17:26:00.000Z	AceOfSpades	Fujitsu	I need to kill the process
2007-12-23T17:27:00.000Z	AceOfSpades	Fujitsu	screen -ls | grep DALnet | cut -f1 -d '.' | kill awk '{print $1}' -  <--- Like this?
2007-12-23T17:28:00.000Z	Fujitsu	AceOfSpades	That won't work.
2007-12-23T17:28:00.000Z	AceOfSpades	Fujitsu	Okay, that works, thanks :)
2007-12-23T17:29:00.000Z	Fujitsu	AceOfSpades	Great :)
2007-12-23T17:37:00.000Z	Fujitsu	AceOfSpades	You've used quotes within the quotes.
2007-12-23T17:37:00.000Z	Fujitsu	AceOfSpades	Escape the quotes around the braces with a backslash.
2007-12-23T17:41:00.000Z	AceOfSpades	Fujitsu	It says alias }/` not found
2007-12-23T17:41:00.000Z	Fujitsu	AceOfSpades	That's a forward slash.
2007-12-23T17:42:00.000Z	AceOfSpades	Fujitsu	I tried the other slash and it's showing more errors

2007-12-23T17:45:00.000Z	Fujitsu	AceOfSpades	Can you post the entire command you're using?
2007-12-23T17:45:00.000Z	AceOfSpades	Fujitsu	alias killDAL='screen -ls | grep DALnet | tail -1 | cut -f1 -d \'.\' | kill `awk \'{print $1}\'`'
2007-12-23T17:46:00.000Z	Fujitsu	AceOfSpades	Hm, possibly try using double quotes where you're using single quotes within the command.
2007-12-23T17:47:00.000Z	AceOfSpades	Fujitsu	Oh, that works :D
2007-12-23T17:47:00.000Z	Fujitsu	AceOfSpades	Great!
