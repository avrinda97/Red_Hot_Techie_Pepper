2007-12-09T03:05:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow		sorry
2007-12-09T03:06:00.000Z	sammyF	Jack_Sparrow	nice one ;)
2007-12-09T03:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sammyF	Sorry, I was on the phone and must have been leaning on the keyboard
2007-12-09T03:07:00.000Z	sammyF	Jack_Sparrow	lol. happens
2008-03-07T23:25:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sammyF	Buggy how.. please be specific  they seem to work for most people
2008-03-07T23:25:00.000Z	sammyF	Jack_Sparrow	one sec. I'll get you the link to the thread in the forums
2008-03-07T23:26:00.000Z	sammyF	Jack_Sparrow	depending on the nvidia chip you have, the ones in the repos can cause random hard locks
2008-03-07T23:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sammyF	Most often it is something else..  Someone that has not set the v/h rates for their monitor
2008-03-07T23:27:00.000Z	sammyF	Jack_Sparrow	nah .. in this case it seems to be a known bug
2008-03-07T23:27:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sammyF	we hava alot more trouble with people that tried to get the ones from NV and failed to get them right when doing it right in the first place will usually fix the problem
2008-03-07T23:28:00.000Z	sammyF	Jack_Sparrow	well .. he asked about "newer drivers" ... that's where I pointed him to, but you're right, it doesn't come without OTHER problems
2008-03-07T23:28:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sammyF	The only nvidia I recommend nvidia drivers for are the 8000 series
2008-03-07T23:29:00.000Z	sammyF	Jack_Sparrow	the bug I mean is experienced with 7xxx cards .. sorry .. searching for the thread at the moment, I deleted the bookmark I had
2008-03-07T23:29:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sammyF	I have three 7000 series cards at this location and none have ever had issue and do have effects.
2008-03-07T23:31:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sammyF	This is all ot  and disscussion more than helping people in channel... SO I am dropping it.. I suggest you do the same
2008-06-26T04:15:00.000Z	sammyF	Jack_Sparrow	or if you have a Q6600 ... apparently the 32 bit version doesn't see all cores (3 for zeeq, 1 for me)
