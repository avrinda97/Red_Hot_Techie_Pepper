2011-10-18T20:11:00.000Z	canaria_79		I need a terminal command to change the dns adresses. I could not find it anywhere. Where does network manager of gnome 3 saves the configuration files? or someone can suggest me something?
2011-10-18T20:11:00.000Z	usr13	canaria_79	edit /etc/resolv.conf
2011-10-18T20:13:00.000Z	usr13	canaria_79	You must have a dhcp server that is giving you another nameserver address ???
2011-10-18T20:14:00.000Z	canaria_79	usr13	no. dhsp does not give me anything. there is a default dns ofcourse but dhsp can not force me to use i gess.. right?
2011-10-18T20:14:00.000Z	canaria_79	usr13	also i can change the dns from gui(even witut been root)
2011-10-18T20:15:00.000Z	usr13	canaria_79	What I'm saying is that there must be a dhcp server on your network that is giving out another nameserver IP.
2011-10-18T20:16:00.000Z	canaria_79	usr13	ok. i don't know what are you talking about exactly. so can you tell me what should i try ?
2011-10-18T20:25:00.000Z	usr13	canaria_79	What I'm trying to say is that you may have more than one dhcp server running on your network.  Find the one that is giving out bogus info and turn it off.
2011-10-18T20:27:00.000Z	canaria_79	usr13	no. i don't use wireles. i just connect with cable. SO i have just one dhsp server. the main problem is network manager saves the configuration files somewhere which i can not find.
2011-10-18T20:29:00.000Z	usr13	canaria_79	There is only one place for nameserver addresses, /etc/resolv.conf
2011-10-18T20:29:00.000Z	usr13	canaria_79	You should start over and tell us the exact issue you are having?
2011-10-18T20:30:00.000Z	usr13	canaria_79	You have a router.  Right?
2011-10-18T20:30:00.000Z	canaria_79	usr13	İ lock this file as root (after i cahnge it with mayn dns servers), network manager could not write on it. it does not give me an error or something. but i look guı of network manager. isee that it use my old dns adresses. also i check it if it is true. how thats possible?
2011-10-18T20:30:00.000Z	usr13	canaria_79	Do you not have any other computers on your newtork?  Just the one you are on?
2011-10-18T20:30:00.000Z	canaria_79	usr13	yes i have a laptop with wireles... the same think is going on it.
2011-10-18T20:31:00.000Z	usr13	canaria_79	Is the nameserver IP address in /etc/resolv.conf changing?
2011-10-18T20:32:00.000Z	canaria_79	usr13	if i change from GUI 8.8.8.8 the network manager writes on configuration file 8.8.8.8. but if i change it from file, nwetwork manager does not listening me. it just use what writes on it's gui.
2011-10-18T20:33:00.000Z	usr13	canaria_79	I have no idea what you just said.  Can you re-phrase it?
2011-10-18T20:35:00.000Z	usr13	canaria_79	ifconfig > ip-config ; route -n >> ip-config ; cat /etc/resolv.conf >> ip-config ; pastebinit ip-config   #Send resulting URL
2011-10-18T20:35:00.000Z	usr13	canaria_79	If your router is giving out a nameserver IP that you don't want to use, change it.
2011-10-18T20:37:00.000Z	usr13	canaria_79	See my pm
