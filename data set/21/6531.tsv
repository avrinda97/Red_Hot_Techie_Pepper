2007-12-25T21:57:00.000Z	Andeh	burner	Hmm.
2007-12-25T21:57:00.000Z	Andeh	burner	i did do quick boot
2007-12-25T21:57:00.000Z	Andeh	burner	Do laptops even HAVE autodetect hard drive option?
2007-12-25T21:58:00.000Z	burner	Andeh	maybe
2007-12-25T22:01:00.000Z	burner	Andeh	intel graphics?  you might not be able to have a usplash
2007-12-25T22:01:00.000Z	Andeh	burner	No, i had it before I installed 7.10 fresh.
2007-12-25T22:02:00.000Z	burner	Andeh	it says the model on the laptop itself
2007-12-25T22:02:00.000Z	Andeh	burner	I am lazy
2007-12-25T22:03:00.000Z	burner	Andeh	there is no splash after login... you should see teh splash after grub but before the login screen
2007-12-25T22:05:00.000Z	burner	Andeh	funny that they recommend it on systems with 512 mb or 1gb ram...  or just sad
