2009-04-26T06:11:00.000Z	tapspat		Hi Guys, I am a newbee to Linux.  I cant write or copy anything in the '/' partition. All other partitions seem Ok ! What should I look for ?
2009-04-26T06:11:00.000Z	tapspat		YES
2009-04-26T06:12:00.000Z	tapspat		root@172.24.200.50:/# echo "ASFSFD" > sa
2009-04-26T06:12:00.000Z	tapspat		-bash: sa: Read-only file system
2009-04-26T06:13:00.000Z	tapspat		root@172.24.200.50:/# echo "ASFSFD" > sa
2009-04-26T06:13:00.000Z	tapspat		-bash: sa: Read-only file system
2009-04-26T06:14:00.000Z	jdu	tapspat	so perhaps it is read only.  What is the output of the command "mount"
2009-04-26T06:14:00.000Z	tapspat	jdu	: For the '/' partition is gives "/dev/sda3 on / type ext2 (rw)"
2009-04-26T06:15:00.000Z	jdu	tapspat	odd, rw indicates that it is writable.  Are you using ubuntu or did you choose ext2 when you installed?
2009-04-26T06:16:00.000Z	tapspat	jdu	: Yes I am using ubuntu and I need to use ext2
2009-04-26T06:17:00.000Z	jdu	tapspat	what is the output of:  ls -l /
2009-04-26T06:19:00.000Z	tapspat	jdu	: All dirs under / have perms "rwxr-xr-x" and owner "root root"
2009-04-26T06:19:00.000Z	jdu	tapspat	try ls -ld /   too like Loose said,
2009-04-26T06:25:00.000Z	jdu	tapspat	is home part of / or on another partition?
2009-04-26T06:25:00.000Z	jdu	tapspat	I guess the question is:  can you write to other places?
2009-04-26T06:25:00.000Z	jdu	tapspat	within the same partition
2009-04-26T06:27:00.000Z	jdu	tapspat	I am basically out of ideas too.  You might try unmounting / and remounting it.
2009-04-26T06:27:00.000Z	tapspat	jdu	: I can write to other partitions. I tried on one and succeeded !
2009-04-26T06:28:00.000Z	tapspat	jdu	Looce : OK. Let me try it ! THANK YOU VERY MUCH guys.
2009-04-26T06:28:00.000Z	jdu	tapspat	sorry we couldn't really help.
2009-04-26T06:29:00.000Z	tapspat	jdu	: I appreciate your help. I will let you guys know if I find something. THANK YOU.
