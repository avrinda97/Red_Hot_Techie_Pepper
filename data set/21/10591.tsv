2007-07-19T11:58:00.000Z	MilitantPotato		How do I backup linux?
2007-07-19T11:58:00.000Z	MilitantPotato		Mondo fails because / is mounted
2007-07-19T11:58:00.000Z	MajorPayne	MilitantPotato	tar the files you want to back up and store it somewhere else?
2007-07-19T12:13:00.000Z	MajorPayne	MilitantPotato	In Ubuntu a partition is mounted somewhere on the root filesystem.
2007-07-19T12:15:00.000Z	MajorPayne	MilitantPotato	The leading / is sometimes important when you are talking about paths.
2007-07-19T12:15:00.000Z	MajorPayne	MilitantPotato	If you don't have the leading / you are talking about relitave paths.
2007-07-19T12:16:00.000Z	MajorPayne	MilitantPotato	Yes.
2007-07-19T12:16:00.000Z	MajorPayne	MilitantPotato	Dev command?
2007-07-19T12:17:00.000Z	MajorPayne	MilitantPotato	In *nix, everything is a file.  Including all your devices.
2007-07-19T12:18:00.000Z	MajorPayne	MilitantPotato	For instance, your first hd may be /dev/sda, your first partition may be /dev/sda1, but in order to access it you have to mount it on the filesystem somewhere.
2007-07-19T12:34:00.000Z	MajorPayne	MilitantPotato	Either escape the spaces with the '\' character like: this\ is\ a\ file or you can put the file name in "".
2007-07-19T12:36:00.000Z	MajorPayne	MilitantPotato	It's an excape character.
2007-07-19T12:36:00.000Z	MajorPayne	MilitantPotato	It treats what ever comes after that as special.
2007-07-19T12:37:00.000Z	MajorPayne	MilitantPotato	Press Places then Home.
2007-07-19T12:38:00.000Z	MajorPayne	MilitantPotato	It's kinda like Windows Explorer.
2007-07-19T12:39:00.000Z	MajorPayne	MilitantPotato	What errors?
2007-07-19T12:42:00.000Z	MajorPayne	MilitantPotato	The 'shell' runs in the "Terminal Emulator".
2007-07-19T12:43:00.000Z	MajorPayne	MilitantPotato	If you do happen to try what hexstar told you make sure you know to use Ctrl+Alt+F7 to get back.
2007-07-19T12:48:00.000Z	MajorPayne	MilitantPotato	You can run as much shells as you have ram to.
2007-07-19T12:48:00.000Z	MajorPayne	MilitantPotato	But that would be a lot of shells.
2007-07-19T12:56:00.000Z	MajorPayne	MilitantPotato	I don't think that is a problem with Nautilus.  I think that is a problem with the mounting.
