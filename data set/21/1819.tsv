2010-09-06T00:55:00.000Z	intrader		ubotto, sorry to interrupt, I need someone's advice on reporting a bug in launchpad (it wants 'package', however, bug is for all packages with UI)
2010-09-06T00:55:00.000Z	jrib	intrader	try #ubuntu-bugs
2010-09-06T00:56:00.000Z	intrader	jrib	ubottu, thanks I will go there
2010-09-21T05:24:00.000Z	jrib	intrader	downgrading isn't supported but that's what you would try
2010-09-21T05:25:00.000Z	intrader	jrib	I don't follow, sorry
2010-09-21T05:25:00.000Z	jrib	intrader	why don't you want to use the drivers you already have?
2010-09-21T05:26:00.000Z	intrader	jrib	I am trying to follow on recommendation by #ubuntu-bugs in relation to bug #631130
2010-09-21T05:28:00.000Z	jrib	intrader	you just enable the repo and update manager will do the rest.  If you aren't comfortable with making your system worse, you probably shouldn't be doing this
2010-09-21T05:30:00.000Z	intrader	jrib	since I installed 10.04 and its recommended updates, 10.04 is practically unusable . I am afraid that it would make it much worse. There is an update to the NVIDIA driver noted in the x-org ppa. But I don't know how to back out in case of problems
2010-09-21T05:30:00.000Z	jrib	intrader	what packages exactly does it upgrade?
2010-09-21T05:31:00.000Z	jrib	intrader	worst case scenario, you just remove the repo, purge the packages it installed and install them back.  But you can also just try to downgrade the packages without the uninstall step
2010-09-21T05:32:00.000Z	intrader	jrib	the packages are listed in https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-x-swat/+archive/x-updates
2010-09-21T05:33:00.000Z	jrib	intrader	if your system is currently unusable, I'd give it a try.  If something goes wrong just come back and we'll help you downgrade
2010-09-21T05:34:00.000Z	intrader	jrib	'remove the repo'?, 'purge the packages...'? 'install them back', etc. Maybe this is way beyond my capabilities!
2010-09-21T05:35:00.000Z	intrader	jrib	I wish I could downgrade to 9.04 as it was last year around july. Now, it is picking up a lot of updates which create the same problem in 9.04 that I have in 10.04
2010-09-21T05:37:00.000Z	intrader	jrib	I still have the CD, but if I install, retaining /home, it installs a bunch of updates that make it behave like 10.04.
2010-09-21T05:38:00.000Z	jrib	intrader	even on a fresh new user?
2010-09-21T05:38:00.000Z	intrader	jrib	on 10.04 a fresh new user has the problems. I have not tried a fresh new user on the old 9.04
2010-09-21T05:50:00.000Z	intrader	jrib	in updating using x-org PPA. I was told there is a ppa tool to back out from an update, do you know of one?
2010-09-21T05:50:00.000Z	jrib	intrader	no
2010-09-21T05:52:00.000Z	intrader	jrib	the steps discribed in https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-x-swat/+archive/x-updates are pretty straightforward I wil try it and let you know if I run into problems. I would have to reinstall to get back though.
