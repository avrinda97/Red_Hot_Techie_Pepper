2007-04-27T16:23:00.000Z	bhuey		hello, my networking is kind of blowing out periodically, is this a known problem ?
2007-04-27T16:23:00.000Z	squee	bhuey	Wireless?
2007-04-27T16:24:00.000Z	squee	bhuey	Perhaps a bad cable or nic?
2007-04-27T16:24:00.000Z	bhuey	squee	I find that I have to bring down the interface and bring it up again to get it to work
2007-04-27T16:24:00.000Z	bhuey	squee	I doubt it
2007-04-27T16:24:00.000Z	squee	bhuey	can you just get a new ip? (dhclient)
2007-04-27T16:25:00.000Z	bhuey	squee	like run that to see what happens ?
2007-04-27T16:25:00.000Z	bhuey	squee	I'm finding that dhclient is broken
2007-04-27T16:25:00.000Z	squee	bhuey	like when it drops, can you just type "sudo dhclient" and get a new ip?  If that is it, then it is a faulty cable/router/nic.  If it must be brought down then up, it is a driver problem / nic prolem
2007-04-27T16:26:00.000Z	squee	bhuey	how is it broken?
2007-04-27T16:26:00.000Z	bhuey	squee	it stop routing packets
2007-04-27T16:26:00.000Z	bhuey	squee	I'm not a networking expert
2007-04-27T16:27:00.000Z	bhuey	squee	the interface stays up but the connection is wacked out, down effectively
2007-04-27T16:27:00.000Z	squee	bhuey	then type sudo dhclient, that will get you a new ip and reauthenticate you to the network
2007-04-27T16:27:00.000Z	bhuey	squee	unfortunately that seems to be broken
2007-04-27T16:28:00.000Z	squee	bhuey	then it is probably the cable / nic
2007-04-27T16:28:00.000Z	bhuey	squee	serious ?
2007-04-27T16:28:00.000Z	squee	bhuey	yep.  I've had bad cables do that to me before
2007-04-27T16:29:00.000Z	bhuey	squee	I've been using this cable for years so this is a bit of a surprise to take
2007-04-27T16:29:00.000Z	bhuey	squee	it's working fine right now
2007-04-27T16:29:00.000Z	squee	bhuey	to be absolutely sure, take a live cd like knoppix or ubuntu edgy, then try to use the network card for a while, if it works fine, then it is the driver.
