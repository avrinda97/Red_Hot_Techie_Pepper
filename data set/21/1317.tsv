2012-01-10T07:39:00.000Z	KrisDouglas	diverdude	sounds like your pc no speaken en enlglish. But seriously it seems you have some unset environment variables, for lack of  a better description.
2012-01-10T07:39:00.000Z	KrisDouglas		Check your settings in the languages/region app
2012-01-10T07:39:00.000Z	diverdude	KrisDouglas	which variables would those be?

2012-01-10T07:44:00.000Z	KrisDouglas	diverdude	wow thats some interesting mess.
2012-01-10T07:44:00.000Z	KrisDouglas	diverdude	whats your default language?

2012-01-10T07:45:00.000Z	KrisDouglas		hmm
2012-01-10T07:45:00.000Z	KrisDouglas		I have n idea why it's not getting that information, diverdude
2012-01-10T07:45:00.000Z	diverdude	KrisDouglas	its really odd
2012-01-10T07:46:00.000Z	KrisDouglas		seems like you're missing some dependencies of the language. But the string for the selected language is odd. Seems to be "C"
2012-01-10T07:46:00.000Z	diverdude	KrisDouglas	(C)hinese? :D
