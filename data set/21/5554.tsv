2007-11-06T23:12:00.000Z	seivan		Excuse me, could someone assist me with grub, I want to make Windows to boot first, and lower the timer to 2 seconds
2007-11-06T23:14:00.000Z	soundray	seivan	do a 'grep ^title /boot/grub/menu.lst | nl -v 0', open menu.lst for editing and enter the number of the entry you want to boot in the line "default 0" instead of the 0
2007-11-06T23:15:00.000Z	soundray	seivan	you will find the timeout option in that file as well.
2007-11-06T23:16:00.000Z	seivan	soundray	thanks, ehm does it start from 0? That means number 4 is actually number 3? Does it count that "break line" as one too? Its just an empy line
2007-11-06T23:16:00.000Z	soundray	seivan	it counts from 0 (that's why default 0 boots the first entry)
2007-11-06T23:16:00.000Z	soundray	seivan	I don't know what you mean by "break line"
2007-11-06T23:17:00.000Z	seivan	soundray	 there is 4 OS there,  ubuntu, ubuntu recovery, ubuntu memtest, an empy line, and Windows
2007-11-06T23:17:00.000Z	seivan	soundray	what number should I put.. 3, 4 or 5?
2007-11-06T23:18:00.000Z	soundray	seivan	the number that shows in front of the entry that you want to boot when you run the command that I gave you.
2007-11-06T23:19:00.000Z	seivan	soundray	 cool, 4 it is :) thanks mate
2007-11-06T23:21:00.000Z	soundray	seivan	strong British influence in Sweden, eh, mate? ;)
2007-11-06T23:22:00.000Z	seivan	soundray	What else should we use, German?
2007-11-06T23:22:00.000Z	soundray	seivan	no, that influence is exerted in the other direction (Sweden -> Germany)
2007-11-06T23:22:00.000Z	seivan	soundray	:)
2007-11-06T23:23:00.000Z	seivan	soundray	Can I bother yo with something else, my I got no sound, I got a realtek chipset
