2008-03-13T02:26:00.000Z	techt0nix		will magicISO work on ubuntu?
2008-03-13T02:28:00.000Z	techt0nix		can someone tell me if magicISO works on ubuntu?
2008-03-13T02:28:00.000Z	corny	techt0nix	I don't think you would need magicISO
2008-03-13T02:28:00.000Z	techt0nix	corny	i use magicISO to burn image cds
2008-03-13T02:29:00.000Z	corny	techt0nix	if you double-click a .iso file it opens a prompt to write it to a CD with the default CD writer
2008-03-13T02:44:00.000Z	corny	techt0nix	in an ubuntu channel?
2008-03-13T03:02:00.000Z	corny	techt0nix	boot in recovery mode and start x manually with 'startx'
2008-03-13T03:05:00.000Z	corny	techt0nix	did your graphics ever work?
2008-03-13T03:05:00.000Z	techt0nix	corny	it works fine in windows
2008-03-13T03:06:00.000Z	corny	techt0nix	I mean did it ever work on Ubuntu
2008-03-13T03:06:00.000Z	techt0nix	corny	no i have never got it to work on ubuntu
2008-03-13T03:07:00.000Z	corny	techt0nix	even the onboard graphics card didn't work
2008-03-13T03:07:00.000Z	techt0nix	corny	im on ubuntu right now with my onboard graphics
2008-03-13T03:09:00.000Z	corny	techt0nix	so it gives you that error and then boots using the onboard card
2008-03-13T03:09:00.000Z	techt0nix	corny	no i disable my onboard when trying to boot my nvidia video card
2008-03-13T03:09:00.000Z	techt0nix	corny	i have to do a cold shutdown then go back into bios
2008-03-13T03:10:00.000Z	corny	techt0nix	I wouldn't suggest disabling your onboard, just use the other driver instead, you always want a fallback
2008-03-13T03:10:00.000Z	techt0nix	corny	my computer monitor will not even turn on unless i disable onboard videocard and enable nvidia one or vis versa
2008-03-13T03:11:00.000Z	corny	techt0nix	I don't know how to help you.
2008-03-13T03:12:00.000Z	techt0nix	corny	noone ever does
2008-03-13T03:12:00.000Z	techt0nix	corny	lol
