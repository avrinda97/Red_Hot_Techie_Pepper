2009-11-02T16:17:00.000Z	duffydack	erUSUL	 hmm I thought it would pull 64bit itself... what about java?  Id rather not use ia32libs
2009-11-02T16:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	duffydack	java is in the mian repos yes. both sun's and openjdk ;)
2009-11-02T16:18:00.000Z	duffydack	erUSUL	and it will pull 64bit by default?
2009-11-02T16:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	duffydack	yes; it does in jaunty too
2009-11-02T16:20:00.000Z	duffydack	erUSUL	thanks.  I seem to remember 64bit been a bit sketchy on ubuntu in the past.. never used it tho.. (im poor)

2010-07-18T16:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	duffydack	do not specify any block count and dd should stop when the file ends
2010-07-18T16:07:00.000Z	duffydack	erUSUL	im not.  I know its not 'bad' to not specify any and have it just run out at the end but I just wondered if there was a cleaner way of doing it..
