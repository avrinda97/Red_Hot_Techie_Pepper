2012-10-21T12:04:00.000Z	insomniac_lemon	Jimster480-Lapto	why are you still running 10.10? If it's because of Unity, you could always try 11.04, Natty Narwhal, the last version before that used Gnome 2 and not Unity
2012-10-21T12:05:00.000Z	Jimster480-Lapto	insomniac_lemon	yea i dont like Unity at all so I never upgraded
2012-10-21T12:06:00.000Z	insomniac_lemon	Jimster480-Lapto	so try 11.04, it uses Gnome 2, not Unity
2012-10-21T12:06:00.000Z	Jimster480-Lapto	insomniac_lemon	I just patch things that I need to. And build myself new kernels as time goes on.
2012-10-21T12:06:00.000Z	Jimster480-Lapto	insomniac_lemon	I'll think about it. I was pretty sure it was on Unity though.
2012-10-21T12:08:00.000Z	insomniac_lemon	Jimster480-Lapto	actually, it has both Unity and Gnome 2
2012-10-21T12:08:00.000Z	Jimster480-Lapto	insomniac_lemon	So its not Unity with the session fallback crap?
2012-10-21T12:09:00.000Z	Jimster480-Lapto	insomniac_lemon	oh ok
2012-10-21T12:09:00.000Z	insomniac_lemon	Jimster480-Lapto	try it on a VM or something
2012-10-21T12:10:00.000Z	Jimster480-Lapto	insomniac_lemon	yea Ill make a VM on my Windows desktop and check it out, its usually what i do with most releases these days
2012-10-21T12:12:00.000Z	Jimster480-Lapto	insomniac_lemon	yea its LTS so it should be supported still
2012-10-21T12:13:00.000Z	Jimster480-Lapto	insomniac_lemon	not that i care that much, if i really have to patch something i can just build it most of the time.
2012-10-21T12:19:00.000Z	Jimster480-Lapto	insomniac_lemon	all .04 's are LTS
2012-10-21T12:19:00.000Z	Jimster480-Lapto	insomniac_lemon	yea i forgot lol.
2012-10-21T12:20:00.000Z	Jimster480-Lapto	insomniac_lemon	in that case ill just stick to my 10.10
2012-10-21T12:20:00.000Z	Jimster480-Lapto	insomniac_lemon	not a issue really
2012-10-21T12:21:00.000Z	Jimster480-Lapto	insomniac_lemon	yea its not LTS. They support for 3 years not 5. The 10.04 ends on the day of the release of 13.04
2012-10-21T12:22:00.000Z	insomniac_lemon	Jimster480-Lapto	from 12.04 LTS description: " While it lacks some new features, it will receive guaranteed support for five years from April 2012"
2012-10-21T12:22:00.000Z	Jimster480-Lapto	insomniac_lemon	ah I see. Man being stuck on 12.04 for 5 years LOL
2012-10-21T12:22:00.000Z	Jimster480-Lapto	insomniac_lemon	5 years of unity would mean that person would be dead xD
2012-10-21T12:24:00.000Z	insomniac_lemon	Jimster480-Lapto	I'm thinking of using 12.04 LTS with Cinnamon instead of Unity. It's made by the makers of Linux Mint because they liked Gnome 2
