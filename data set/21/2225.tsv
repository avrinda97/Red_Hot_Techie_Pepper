2010-01-14T12:37:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	brandon-	What do you mean by places menu? You want to add folders?
2010-01-14T12:37:00.000Z	brandon-	kinja-sheep	  i mean like by default it has Main  Places and System or whatever
2010-01-14T12:38:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	brandon-	I don't believe that is possible because nobody make an applet for that one.
2010-01-14T12:39:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	brandon-	You use it for netbook?
2010-01-14T13:23:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	brandon-	That is the path. Or ~/.themes (for personal themes).
2010-01-15T09:43:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	brandon-	You could try and use xfce4-panel?
2010-01-15T09:43:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	brandon-	I understand that but the great thing about it is that you could run just about anything. (Yes, that is what I mean by that).
2010-01-15T09:44:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	brandon-	"aptitude install -yRs xfce4-places-plugin" (-R for eliminating recommends).
2010-01-15T09:45:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	brandon-	Won't hurt to try. :)
2010-01-15T09:46:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	brandon-	Great. You could use Gnome panel on top and XFCE panel on bottom then. I don't know why I didn't thought of that yesterday. :o
2010-01-19T11:33:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	brandon-	Do you have OpenOffice?
2010-01-19T11:34:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	brandon-	That is it.
