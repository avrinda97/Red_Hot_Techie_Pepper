2005-04-29T09:50:00.000Z	salvestrini		thats not important
2005-04-29T09:50:00.000Z	salvestrini		what is important
2005-04-29T09:50:00.000Z	salvestrini		is that mplayerplug-in freezes
2005-04-29T09:52:00.000Z	salvestrini		so what i did was uninstall mplayerplug-in and install mozplugger
2005-04-29T09:52:00.000Z	salvestrini		mozplugger works but there is no sound
2005-04-29T09:54:00.000Z	salvestrini		frank try azureus, it's a good bittorrent client
2005-04-29T09:55:00.000Z	salvestrini		sorry frank my keyboard behaves a little funny
2005-04-29T09:57:00.000Z	salvestrini		o sorry about that frank
2005-04-29T09:57:00.000Z	salvestrini		i havent seen any other bittorrent for linux that comes close to azureus
2005-04-29T09:58:00.000Z	salvestrini		couple of questions, is there a way to enable 3d acceleration for an iMac running Hoary?
2005-04-29T09:58:00.000Z	farruinn	salvestrini	what's the video card?
2005-04-29T09:59:00.000Z	farruinn	salvestrini	I think the default driver is ati, I think you can change that to r128
2005-04-29T09:59:00.000Z	salvestrini	farruinn	whenever i did that xorg would kick me out
2005-04-29T10:00:00.000Z	farruinn	salvestrini	oh weird
2005-04-29T10:02:00.000Z	farruinn	salvestrini	I've got an ati rage 128 in my B&W g3 and the r128 driver works with it (not sure I'm getting any hardware acceleration though)
2005-04-29T10:41:00.000Z	farruinn	salvestrini	maybe it's working better than in windows, only coming on when truly needed? (maybe?)
2005-04-29T10:42:00.000Z	farruinn	salvestrini	:?
2005-04-29T10:42:00.000Z	salvestrini	farruinn	i mean the fan has not come on for an hour
2005-04-29T10:43:00.000Z	farruinn	salvestrini	what does less /proc/cpuinfo
2005-04-29T10:45:00.000Z	salvestrini	farruinn	heres the full dump:processor       : 0
2005-04-29T10:48:00.000Z	farruinn	salvestrini	sorry, I primarily use macs, so I don't really know what's going with your fan :/
