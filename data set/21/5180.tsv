2009-02-24T22:32:00.000Z	SingAlong		Hi all
2009-02-24T22:34:00.000Z	SingAlong		My website blog.akashxav.com showed a dns error around an hour back. and then it is fine (and viewable to others). but still i get the dns error page on my firefox. I restarted ubuntu, cleared my cache, restarted my router, but nothing works.
2009-02-24T22:34:00.000Z	SingAlong		running 8.04
2009-02-24T22:35:00.000Z	papapep	SingAlong	your sites works correctly now
2009-02-24T22:35:00.000Z	SingAlong	papapep	but i still get the dns error page
2009-02-24T22:35:00.000Z	SingAlong	papapep	on my comp
2009-02-24T22:36:00.000Z	SingAlong	papapep	I restarted everything. comp, router, cleared ff cache. but still
2009-02-24T22:36:00.000Z	papapep	SingAlong	but wich is the exact message
2009-02-24T22:36:00.000Z	SingAlong	papapep	"DNS error - server not found"
2009-02-24T22:37:00.000Z	papapep	SingAlong	if you specify directly the ip, it works?
2009-02-24T22:37:00.000Z	SingAlong	papapep	the main domain akashxav.com works fine on my comp. just the blog subdomain
2009-02-24T22:38:00.000Z	SingAlong	papapep	ya
2009-02-24T22:39:00.000Z	SingAlong	papapep	and works for everyone else except me.
2009-02-24T22:41:00.000Z	papapep	SingAlong	did you compare both configurations (of one of the working subdomains and the one that does not), to try to find the problem?
2009-02-24T22:42:00.000Z	SingAlong	papapep	ya
2009-02-24T22:42:00.000Z	SingAlong	papapep	same config
2009-02-24T22:43:00.000Z	papapep	SingAlong	and your isp's config, did you ask them about the problem?
2009-02-24T22:43:00.000Z	SingAlong	papapep	their customer care works only from 10am-3pm
2009-02-24T22:43:00.000Z	papapep	SingAlong	if you've got it all correctly, it has to be your isp's fault :-/
2009-02-24T22:44:00.000Z	papapep	SingAlong	then you'll have to wait until then (don't know what time it is where you live...:-))
2009-02-24T22:44:00.000Z	SingAlong	papapep	11.15pm. India :)
