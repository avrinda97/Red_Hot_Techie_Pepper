2011-02-10T19:32:00.000Z	twitch	takamarou	your gateway is on a diferent subnet ..
2011-02-10T19:32:00.000Z	takamarou	twitch	I know.  The gateway's subnet is the primary gateway.. Has to be that way for external access reasons.
2011-02-10T19:33:00.000Z	twitch	takamarou	so your gateway can route different zones?
2011-02-10T19:34:00.000Z	takamarou	twitch	the gateways are actually the same device.  It's a firewall setup with different zones for security.  Theres a passthrough from 192.2.46.* to 192.2.40.*
2011-02-10T19:34:00.000Z	twitch	takamarou	ahh ok if it has the rules .. ermm weird
2011-02-10T19:36:00.000Z	twitch	takamarou	can u even ping it? or nmap it's subnet
2011-02-10T19:37:00.000Z	takamarou	twitch	I can ping it.  will nmap in a moment
2011-02-10T19:39:00.000Z	twitch	takamarou	nmap it
2011-02-10T19:39:00.000Z	takamarou	twitch	nmap not installed..
2011-02-10T19:40:00.000Z	takamarou	twitch	I can run it locally.  are you just looking to see open ports?  or test my network abilities?
2011-02-10T19:40:00.000Z	twitch	takamarou	"sudo apt-get install nmap | sudo nmap -sS <ip>"
2011-02-10T19:40:00.000Z	twitch	takamarou	u might need -PN as well
2011-02-10T19:41:00.000Z	takamarou	twitch	I'd prefer not to install nmap.  Trying to keep this server pretty clean - it's production and I don't want too many bloated tools on it
2011-02-10T19:41:00.000Z	twitch	takamarou	nmap is tiny ......
2011-02-10T19:41:00.000Z	takamarou	twitch	a local nmap of the NAS gives http://pastie.org/1549076
2011-02-10T19:45:00.000Z	twitch	takamarou	if u can nmpa it and all those ports are open ... there's a filter somewhere
2011-02-10T19:45:00.000Z	twitch	takamarou	prolly on the router
2011-02-10T19:46:00.000Z	takamarou	twitch	the odd thing is that 1: I can mount the NFS fine from my local machine and 2: I was able to connect a week ago before a restart.. and no firewall settings have changed
2011-02-10T19:47:00.000Z	twitch	takamarou	ok mount nfs on same subnet or different, connect how ssh?
2011-02-10T19:48:00.000Z	takamarou	twitch	different subnet.  I'm connecting via ssh
2011-02-10T19:49:00.000Z	twitch	takamarou	ok dunno but im limited becuase im wasted and going to bed now :P but i still reckon it's a filter :P prolly wrong but thtas much hunch ... try telnet port 139 .. anyway goodnight
