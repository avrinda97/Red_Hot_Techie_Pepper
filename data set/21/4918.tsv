2009-10-12T02:12:00.000Z	masterfu		i got a little question for upgrading to xubuntu 9.04
2009-10-12T02:12:00.000Z	masterfu		Upgrading may reduce desktop effects, and performance in games and other graphically intensive programs.
2009-10-12T02:12:00.000Z	masterfu		This computer is currently using the AMD 'fglrx' graphics driver. No version of this driver is available that works with your hardware in Ubuntu 9.04.
2009-10-12T02:12:00.000Z	masterfu		Do you want to continue?
2009-10-12T02:12:00.000Z	masterfu		what is this?
2009-10-12T02:14:00.000Z	masterfu		so do you guys know anything about that?
2009-10-12T02:14:00.000Z	masterfu		should i upgrade or no?
2009-10-12T02:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	masterfu	i think you'll just find you need to reinstall the video driver
2009-10-12T02:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	masterfu	sure, you may have to revert to vesa driver before rebooting
2009-10-12T02:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	masterfu	sudo apt-get clean
2009-10-12T02:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	masterfu	theres computer-janitor too
2009-10-12T02:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	masterfu	uninstall apps you dont need
2009-10-12T02:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	masterfu	could ditch openoffice (500Mb) and install abiword (10Mb) and gnumeric (12Mb)
2009-10-12T02:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	masterfu	you can also run: dpkg -l | grep linux-image    and uninstall old unused kernels
2009-10-12T02:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	masterfu	could also remove gimp if you dont use it
2009-10-12T02:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	masterfu	you need to clear space, some apps you wont use and can be removed
2009-10-12T02:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	masterfu	the system holds onto all the old kernels which are about ~100Mb per kernel
2009-10-12T02:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	masterfu	you can see your  current kernel with: uname -r    DO NOT delete that one
2009-10-12T02:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	masterfu	if you run: sudo apt-get --purge remove linux-image-<some numbers here-generic
2009-10-12T02:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	masterfu	no problem, those are the modules for each kernel
2009-10-12T02:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	masterfu	you should also run: sudo apt-get --purge autoremove
