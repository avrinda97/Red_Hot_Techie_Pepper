I am trying to burn a dvd structure folder that contains a AUDIO_TS and a VIDEO_TS folder and I have previously used makedvd -burn /folder/. well the folder this time happens to be on a smb share that I mounted locally. I am getting an error specifically :- [ WRITE@LBA=1f90h failed with SK=3h/WRITE ERROR - RECOVERY FAILED]: Input/Output error.
