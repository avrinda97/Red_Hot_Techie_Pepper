2009-10-06T17:28:00.000Z	viirus		I have a major problem..... does anybody know if you can rescue files from an encrypted hdd?.....
2009-10-06T17:29:00.000Z	sipior	viirus	that would defeat the point of encryption, wouldn't it?
2009-10-06T17:29:00.000Z	viirus	sipior	and if i have the password?
2009-10-06T17:29:00.000Z	sipior	viirus	then you should be fine, assuming the volume is not corrupted.
2009-10-06T17:30:00.000Z	viirus	sipior	the problem is that i accidently made a new filesystem on it (just started... was runnig for about 5 seconds then i noticed the mistake and killed the pc)
2009-10-06T17:30:00.000Z	viirus	sipior	and now I cant mount it anymore....
2009-10-06T17:31:00.000Z	sipior	viirus	hmm...tricky. have you tried TestDisk? might not work, but worth a shot.
2009-10-06T17:31:00.000Z	sipior	viirus	i'm guessing backups aren't an option.
2009-10-06T17:31:00.000Z	viirus	sipior	testdisk didnt seem to work (probably as its encrypted)
2009-10-06T17:32:00.000Z	viirus	sipior	backups dont exist -.-
2009-10-06T17:34:00.000Z	sipior	viirus	what did use to perform the encryption?
2009-10-06T17:34:00.000Z	viirus	sipior	luks
2009-10-06T17:37:00.000Z	sipior	viirus	i think you might be in serious trouble. best bet might be to peruse the dm-crypt mailing list archives (someone else has surely done the same thing already). i'm afraid i don't know what else to suggest.
2009-10-06T17:37:00.000Z	viirus	sipior	hm... ok :(
2009-10-06T17:37:00.000Z	sipior	viirus	well, i'd suggest keeping backups next time, but i don't want to rub it in. harsh enough lesson already, i imagine.
2009-10-06T17:37:00.000Z	viirus	sipior	already thought that im in trouble -.-
2009-10-06T17:38:00.000Z	viirus	sipior	the actually funny thing (well... i dont think its that funny but for others it surely is).... that i deleted a backup a few days ago because i thought ill never need it and the device wasnt encrypted -.-
2009-10-06T17:39:00.000Z	sipior	viirus	i heard a clever saying recently: "The Universe tends towards maximum irony."
2009-10-06T17:39:00.000Z	viirus	sipior	:/
2009-10-06T17:40:00.000Z	viirus	sipior	ill check the backup harddrive... maybe theres something to save there
2009-10-06T17:40:00.000Z	sipior	viirus	might be a better bet, actually
