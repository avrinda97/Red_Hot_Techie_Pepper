2008-06-28T02:19:00.000Z	Ademan		can you run a command and paste the results for me?
2008-06-28T02:19:00.000Z	Ademan		find ~/.themes
2008-06-28T02:19:00.000Z	Ademan		and then paste it at http://rafb.net/paste
2008-06-28T02:20:00.000Z	Ademan		cause it works fine here using the install method i described, and i don't have anything special here
2008-06-28T02:21:00.000Z	Ademan		~ is your home directory
2008-06-28T02:21:00.000Z	Ademan		.themes is a hidden directory
2008-06-28T02:22:00.000Z	onthefence928	Ademan	i don't see it anywhere >.>
2008-06-28T02:06:00.000Z	Ademan	onthefence928	install the gtk2.0-engines-murrine  packages
2008-06-28T02:09:00.000Z	Ademan	onthefence928	hrm, what's the theme? i wouldn't be surprised if it was a bad theme
2008-06-28T02:11:00.000Z	Ademan	onthefence928	i'm pretty sure that's a pixbuf theme, i guess it could use murrine as well
2008-06-28T02:11:00.000Z	Ademan	onthefence928	yeah, but it's pretty clearly a pixbuf theme, i'm downloading it right now, one second
2008-06-28T02:14:00.000Z	Ademan	onthefence928	so how is it not working? what's it doing?
2008-06-28T02:16:00.000Z	onthefence928	Ademan	well the download itself doesn't install correctly, and when i install the re-packaged files (only teh GTK and metacity parts) nothing happens, i can't use the new theme
2008-06-28T02:18:00.000Z	Ademan	onthefence928	oh well what you need to do is take from the tarball the Cylon Eye '72 directory (which contains gtk-2.0 and metacity) and copy it into your ~/.themes directory, so that you have, in your themes directory ~/.themes/Cylon Eye '72/gtk-2.0   and ~/.themes/Cylon Eye '72/metacity-1
2008-06-28T02:19:00.000Z	onthefence928	Ademan	it's just a whited out icon with a big black "?" on it (as seen in my appearence preferences window)
2008-06-28T02:20:00.000Z	onthefence928	Ademan	where is ~/.themes?
2008-06-28T02:23:00.000Z	Ademan	onthefence928	well it's a hidden file, to see it you need to hit ctrl+h
2008-06-28T02:27:00.000Z	onthefence928	Ademan	ok i copy and pasted it, should it be a .tar.gz like when i install it using the theme manager?
2008-06-28T02:28:00.000Z	onthefence928	Ademan	ok then still no dice
2008-06-28T02:29:00.000Z	Ademan	onthefence928	can you run find ~/.themes    in a terminal and copy the output to http://rafb.net/paste   ?
2008-06-28T02:30:00.000Z	onthefence928	Ademan	what's teh command to see it?
