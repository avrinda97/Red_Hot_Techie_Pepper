2009-10-04T09:16:00.000Z	chu_		How do I quit from a channel in irssi, I don't want to leave my session, just close down a channel (I opened #uubuntu :()
2009-10-04T09:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chu_	 irssi has some very well done docs at their homepage.
2009-10-04T09:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chu_	 i belive its '/window close  '  in the channel you wish to close.
2009-11-07T16:33:00.000Z	chu_	Dr_Willis	- Where is the xsplash dir? You have peaked my interests :p
2009-11-07T16:34:00.000Z	chu_	Dr_Willis	- Cheers
2009-11-07T16:35:00.000Z	chu_	Dr_Willis	- Do you know where the funky changing space background is located? :p
2009-11-07T16:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chu_	 same directgory - its the throbber
2009-11-07T16:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chu_	 or ya mean the wallpaper? thats in the wallpapers dir.
2009-11-07T16:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chu_	 they are in the wallpaper dirs
2009-11-07T16:38:00.000Z	chu_	Dr_Willis	- Is there any way of contacting you outside of IRC? :p You probably know everything I want to know, it would be faser talking to you one-on-one (yes, could pm, but what about tomorrow? if I'm not on irc etc!!!)
2009-11-07T16:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chu_	 i am always here on irc it seems like
2009-12-27T07:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chu_	 theres some alterantivces to that applet. You could just find the icon (i think its a svg file) and rename/change it so its not loaded..
2009-12-27T07:24:00.000Z	chu_	Dr_Willis	I really like the text style, i.e. "Applications Places System". My problem is the whole forcing panel size to be 24 pixels, I've seen some tutorials for changing the image, but was wanting to remove it all together. If I can point it to an image that doesn't exist, is that likely to load nothing?
2009-12-27T07:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chu_	 err.. I thought ive enlarged the panel height and the icons rescaled to the higer image. thats the point of the svg icon
2009-12-27T07:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chu_	 i dont worry about the image..  so no idea. i do recall some alternative applets taht can replace the whole  3 menus with like one single submenu setup. but i dont consider it worth worrying about
2010-02-14T07:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chu_	 or you somehow ran it as root and goofed up the permissions on the file
2010-02-14T07:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chu_	 you could remove the settings dirs perhaps.
2010-02-14T07:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chu_	 or move them to some other dir/name and restart the browser
2010-02-14T07:28:00.000Z	chu_	Dr_Willis	- Can you guide me on how-to either remove the settings directory or just move/rename them?
2010-02-14T07:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chu_	 they are in some dir in your home. I dont use 'chromium' so i dont know what they are called
2010-02-14T07:38:00.000Z	chu_	Dr_Willis	I *love* you :D
