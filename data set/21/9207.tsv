2006-01-03T17:25:00.000Z	ryorininseven		Hey, anybody have any experience with installing VMWare 5.5?
2006-01-03T17:26:00.000Z	mwe	ryorininseven	yeah. I just ran the installation script with sudo
2006-01-03T17:26:00.000Z	ryorininseven	mwe	So did I, but VMWare crashes a few seconds after starting now.
2006-01-03T17:27:00.000Z	mwe	ryorininseven	hm. I don't know why. I'd check the log files
2006-01-03T17:27:00.000Z	ryorininseven	mwe	Which log files should I be looking at?
2006-01-03T17:28:00.000Z	mwe	ryorininseven	syslog and what not in /var/log. or look in /home/ryorininseven/vmware and subdirs if anything is there
2006-01-03T17:30:00.000Z	mwe	ryorininseven	vmware runs without trouble here, though
2006-01-03T17:30:00.000Z	ryorininseven	mwe	What kernel are you running?
2006-01-03T17:30:00.000Z	ryorininseven	mwe	And you're using Hoary or Breezy?
2006-01-03T17:32:00.000Z	ryorininseven	mwe	And I've got no mention of any vmware errors in any of the log files, so that's a little distressing.
2006-01-03T17:32:00.000Z	mwe	ryorininseven	auw. that's bad
2006-01-03T17:33:00.000Z	mwe	ryorininseven	and the modules are loading ok?
2006-01-03T17:33:00.000Z	mwe	ryorininseven	dmesg says nothing either?
2006-01-03T17:33:00.000Z	ryorininseven	mwe	Seems that way, yeah.
2006-01-03T17:33:00.000Z	ryorininseven	mwe	Dmesg has nothing but stuff about setting keycodes, but I've been getting that for a while now.
2006-01-03T17:33:00.000Z	mwe	ryorininseven	then I can't help you, sorry
2006-01-03T17:33:00.000Z	ryorininseven	mwe	No problem. Thanks anyway.
2006-01-03T17:34:00.000Z	mwe	ryorininseven	unkown scancodes in dmesg? shouldn't influence right
2006-01-03T17:34:00.000Z	ryorininseven	mwe	Right.
2006-01-03T17:34:00.000Z	ryorininseven	mwe	Far as I can tell, they're basically harmless gripes -- maybe tied to Windowmaker, I dunno.
2006-01-03T17:35:00.000Z	ryorininseven	mwe	Anyways, I need to get moving. Thanks again for the help.
