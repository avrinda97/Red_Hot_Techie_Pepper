2011-08-17T03:14:00.000Z	WallyJ2K		Hello all. Back again to ask about my external VGA setup. Can't get anything to how on my TV from my laptop. ideas/
2011-08-17T03:14:00.000Z	WallyJ2K		?
2011-08-17T03:16:00.000Z	WallyJ2K		This isn't TV-out, it's VGA out... and my video card is ATI, not NVidia...
2011-08-17T03:16:00.000Z	WallyJ2K		just saw the second link. I'll check it out, but again... VGA out, not TV out
2011-08-17T03:17:00.000Z	WallyJ2K		I am pretty sure I need to adjust my refresh rate from 60 to 59.934, but 11.04 doesn't use the xorg.conf any more.
2011-08-17T03:19:00.000Z	WallyJ2K		so I can put settings into a new xorg.conf file in the etc directory and it will pick up the settings?
2011-08-17T03:19:00.000Z	DasEi	WallyJ2K	yep
2011-08-17T03:21:00.000Z	DasEi	WallyJ2K	which g-card ?
2011-08-17T03:22:00.000Z	DasEi	WallyJ2K	a very basic xorg you get if you run sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2011-08-17T03:22:00.000Z	DasEi	WallyJ2K	case that is a hassle next boot, simply delete it from tty then
2011-08-17T05:30:00.000Z	DasEi	WallyJ2K	can you give exact model of screen ?
2011-08-17T05:29:00.000Z	DasEi	WallyJ2K	you can lookup modelines in /etc/X11/Xorg.0.log, and there is a tool cvt out, sadly not in repos
2011-08-17T05:42:00.000Z	DasEi	WallyJ2K	model ?
2011-08-17T05:48:00.000Z	DasEi	WallyJ2K	sorry, can't find it in database
2011-08-17T05:53:00.000Z	DasEi	WallyJ2K	http://pastebin.com/RCvPuFwG, own risk, generic
2011-08-17T05:54:00.000Z	DasEi	WallyJ2K	there are tools not available in default ubu, some screens can be found there
2011-08-17T06:00:00.000Z	DasEi	WallyJ2K	restart gdm yes, and need general vid-section with radeon by chance
2011-08-17T06:01:00.000Z	DasEi	WallyJ2K	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg didn't create a file ??
2011-08-17T06:02:00.000Z	DasEi	WallyJ2K	sudo gdm stop , then sudo gdm start
2011-08-17T06:02:00.000Z	DasEi	WallyJ2K	err, ja service not to forget
2011-08-17T06:07:00.000Z	DasEi	WallyJ2K	nope, but then again re-write the mitor sections
