2010-10-20T12:15:00.000Z	fep		where should i ask about vmware?
2010-10-20T12:16:00.000Z	lucent	fep	I guess anyone who knows about vmware, or... if it's closed-source, ask the vendor
2010-10-20T12:24:00.000Z	lucent	fep	that level of integration, I haven't seen a VM that will do it for something as uh - retarded - as Windows XP
2010-10-20T12:24:00.000Z	fep	lucent	it will be a test box, ofcourse, that is not retarded.
2010-10-20T12:25:00.000Z	lucent	fep	I meant "retarded" as a description of Windows XP's core functionality, it requires realmode calls and a lot of, I don't know it's just short of magic trying to make it do anything useful in a VM from a programming standpoint
2010-10-20T12:26:00.000Z	fep	lucent	oh, i see :)
2010-10-20T12:26:00.000Z	fep	lucent	but my question is really, if i install wmware server, does it start and close like a program, or will it be a server "integrated" in my ubuntu OS that eat memory?
2010-10-20T12:26:00.000Z	lucent	fep	trying to find a VM doing what you want is, trying to find an answer to the near-impossible or at least very difficult problem of running Win XP in a VM at all
2010-10-20T12:27:00.000Z	lucent	fep	like, always locking memory away from your main OS?
2010-10-20T12:27:00.000Z	fep	lucent	yes
2010-10-20T12:27:00.000Z	lucent	fep	probably.
2010-10-20T12:27:00.000Z	lucent	fep	Xen would lock memory the whole time, not just while your VM ran
2010-10-20T12:28:00.000Z	fep	lucent	i see, thanks for the info.. i will be reading a little about it
2010-10-20T12:29:00.000Z	lucent	fep	for a reference of "how Ubuntu does it" you should try playing with KVM (virtualization manager UI can manage it)
2010-10-20T12:29:00.000Z	lucent	fep	from KVM experience, check out virtualbox, and then I think vmware
2010-10-20T12:30:00.000Z	fep	lucent	virtualbox sounds like a light version of wmware, sounds like something to start with =)
2010-10-20T12:30:00.000Z	lucent	fep	if you venture beyond KVM, it's basically unsupported / forum community for help
2010-10-20T12:31:00.000Z	fep	lucent	is virtualbox something i can turn off and on, so it dont use cpu and memory ?
2010-10-20T12:32:00.000Z	lucent	fep	repeat, I know only about kvm ;)
2010-10-20T12:33:00.000Z	fep	lucent	ok, thanks
2010-10-20T12:33:00.000Z	fep	lucent	i will check it out
