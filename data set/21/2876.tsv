2009-05-27T06:49:00.000Z	Ohithere		Is it possible/probable that a reason for xfce4 not being able to function correctly, is that the kernel is too out of date for the version of the xfce4 package?
2009-05-27T06:50:00.000Z	raylu	Ohithere	not in ubuntu
2009-05-27T06:52:00.000Z	raylu	Ohithere	because you got your kernel from the ubuntu repositories
2009-05-27T06:52:00.000Z	raylu	Ohithere	so it should be recent
2009-05-27T06:52:00.000Z	raylu	Ohithere	...
2009-05-27T06:52:00.000Z	raylu	Ohithere	then you shouldn't be asking the question in #ubuntu
2009-05-27T06:52:00.000Z	raylu	Ohithere	uname -a
2009-05-27T06:53:00.000Z	raylu	Ohithere	show me the output, nonethless
2009-05-27T06:54:00.000Z	Ohithere	raylu	Linux kelia 2.6.18-92.1.18.el5.028stab060.2xen #1 SMP Tue Jan 13 12:04:44 MSK 2009 i686 GNU/Linux
2009-05-27T06:55:00.000Z	raylu	Ohithere	any particular reason you're running that?
2009-05-27T06:55:00.000Z	raylu	Ohithere	so... don't...?
2009-05-27T06:55:00.000Z	raylu	Ohithere	sounds like you need a new vps
2009-05-27T07:37:00.000Z	raylu	Ohithere	ubuntu makes modifications to the vanilla kernel
2009-05-27T07:37:00.000Z	raylu	Ohithere	red hat does the same (i assume we're still talking about this?)
2009-05-27T07:38:00.000Z	raylu	Ohithere	then ,they make sure that their respective packages run on their respective kernels
2009-05-27T07:38:00.000Z	raylu	Ohithere	that something failed is no surprise, regardless of age or version
2009-05-27T07:38:00.000Z	raylu	Ohithere	...
2009-05-27T07:39:00.000Z	raylu	Ohithere	i juts got done explaining why it's obvious that nothing runs
2009-05-27T07:39:00.000Z	raylu	Ohithere	because the ubuntu packages are made to run on and tested against the ubuntu kernel
2009-05-27T07:39:00.000Z	raylu	Ohithere	which has code that is different from the red hat kernel
2009-05-27T07:40:00.000Z	raylu	Ohithere	which... is what i just said
