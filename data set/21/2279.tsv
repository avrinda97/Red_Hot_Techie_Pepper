2010-06-06T18:39:00.000Z	dsnyders		HI All!  I used to have icons on my desktop.  However now they're all gone, and even a reboot has not brought them back.  How do I get my desktop icons back?
2010-06-06T18:40:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	dsnyders	are you still using nautilus?
2010-06-06T18:40:00.000Z	dsnyders	aeon-ltd	yes.
2010-06-06T18:41:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	dsnyders	you may have just turned off the option of nautilus managing the desktop icons, the setting will either be in preferences or gconf manager
2010-08-16T03:52:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	dsnyders	you mean gdm the login manager?#
2010-08-16T03:53:00.000Z	dsnyders	aeon-ltd	Yes, I believe so.
2010-08-16T03:54:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	dsnyders	look in /usr/share/ or /usr/share/gdm, i think the gdm themes are stored there
2010-08-16T03:55:00.000Z	dsnyders	aeon-ltd	I've been looking, but I do not know what the file is called.  There are 300+ folders in /usr/share and /usr/share/gdm doesn't seem to have any pictures in it.
2010-08-16T03:56:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	dsnyders	look in /usr/share/gdm/themes
2010-08-16T03:59:00.000Z	dsnyders	aeon-ltd	There is no /usr/share/gdm/themes folder.   No worries though, trism pointed me  /usr/share/backgrounds
2010-08-16T03:59:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	dsnyders	'kay
2010-08-16T04:02:00.000Z	dsnyders	aeon-ltd	trism, AArgh!  It was showing in System>Preferences>Appearances all along.  I just didn't recognize it from the thumbnail.
2010-09-29T02:31:00.000Z	dsnyders	aeon-ltd	When I issue the ntpdate command (as root) I get the error: the NTP socket is in use, exiting
2010-09-29T02:33:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	dsnyders	do a 'sudo /etc/init.d/ntp stop' to kill the service
2010-09-29T02:33:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	dsnyders	also why not just use the gui method?
2010-09-29T02:34:00.000Z	dsnyders	aeon-ltd	What gui method?
2010-09-29T02:34:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	dsnyders	first link
2010-09-29T02:36:00.000Z	dsnyders	aeon-ltd	That doesn't force an update.
2010-09-29T02:36:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	dsnyders	ok
2010-09-29T02:45:00.000Z	dsnyders	aeon-ltd	Okay.  /etc/init.d/ntp stop   ntpdate tock.utoronto.ca  /etc/init.d/ntp restart  seemed to do it for me.
2010-09-29T02:48:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	dsnyders	ok, glad i could help
