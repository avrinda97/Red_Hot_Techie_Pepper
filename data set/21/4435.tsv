2009-06-13T17:35:00.000Z	ziroday	lambengolmor	I can take a stab at it, what's not working?
2009-06-13T17:36:00.000Z	lambengolmor	ziroday	I just tried it for the first time so i don't know if it's a server or client issue... When i try to connect i get failed: RPC Error: Program not registered
2009-06-13T17:36:00.000Z	ziroday	lambengolmor	what command are you running?
2009-06-13T17:37:00.000Z	lambengolmor	ziroday	sudo mount 192.168.0.3:/media/archive/Download /media/magi/Download/
2009-06-13T17:38:00.000Z	ziroday	lambengolmor	that looks all fine, what does /etc/exports look like?
2009-06-13T17:39:00.000Z	lambengolmor	ziroday	/media/archive/Download 192.168.0.5/255.255.255.255.0(ro,async,subtree_check)
2009-06-13T17:40:00.000Z	lambengolmor	ziroday	plus configuration for other device, but I wanted to try mounting one at time
2009-06-13T17:40:00.000Z	ziroday	lambengolmor	err that netmask looks screwy, one sec
2009-06-13T17:41:00.000Z	lambengolmor	ziroday	no, i've copied it wrong
2009-06-13T17:41:00.000Z	lambengolmor	ziroday	it's 255.255.255.0
2009-06-13T17:42:00.000Z	ziroday	lambengolmor	ah, that looks better
2009-06-13T17:43:00.000Z	ziroday	lambengolmor	try doing sudo exportfs -a and sudo /etc/init.d/nfs-whatever restart
2009-06-13T17:45:00.000Z	lambengolmor	ziroday	I've tried again, i think it's the 12th time i restart those both on server and on client and i also did 2 reboot... the result is the same
2009-06-13T17:45:00.000Z	lambengolmor	ziroday	thanks anyway
2009-06-13T17:45:00.000Z	ziroday	lambengolmor	have you done sudo exportfs -a ?
2009-06-13T17:45:00.000Z	lambengolmor	ziroday	yes, also that
2009-06-13T17:45:00.000Z	ziroday	lambengolmor	hmm, what about sudo exportfs -ra?
2009-06-13T17:46:00.000Z	ziroday	lambengolmor	hmm http://nfs.sourceforge.net/nfs-howto/ar01s07.html#unable_to_mount_fs might be able to help you better then I can
2009-06-13T17:47:00.000Z	lambengolmor	ziroday	thanks a lot! anyway also exportfs -ra + deamons resart didn't worked...
2009-06-13T17:47:00.000Z	ziroday	lambengolmor	bummer
2009-06-13T17:49:00.000Z	ziroday	lambengolmor	also I would try 192.168.0.0/25(ro,async,subtree_check)
