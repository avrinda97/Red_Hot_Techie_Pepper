2011-02-15T17:31:00.000Z	Djlbert		I guess ill never beable to fix it then ive looked everywhere
2011-02-15T17:31:00.000Z	Djlbert		this is probably th eonly thing windows is better for
2011-02-15T17:31:00.000Z	Djlbert		no I wont
2011-02-15T17:31:00.000Z	Djlbert		how though
2011-02-15T17:32:00.000Z	Djlbert		like I want to use my xbox controller as a keyboard
2011-02-15T17:32:00.000Z	Djlbert		is that easy?
2011-02-15T17:32:00.000Z	Djlbert		its just a usb gamepad basically
2011-02-15T17:33:00.000Z	th0r	Djlbert	research the xmodmap file in linux
2011-02-15T17:33:00.000Z	Djlbert		k
2011-02-15T17:35:00.000Z	Djlbert	th0r	probalem is finding out the values for the xbox controller buttons
2011-02-15T17:36:00.000Z	Djlbert		otherwise that would seemingly be very easy to do
2011-02-15T17:36:00.000Z	Djlbert		with xmodmap
2011-02-15T17:36:00.000Z	th0r	Djlbert	there is a program for that, but I don't recall what it is. You run it and when you press a button it returns the keycode
2011-02-15T17:36:00.000Z	Djlbert		yeah thats exactly what I need
2011-02-15T17:37:00.000Z	th0r	Djlbert	a simple search would solve your issue http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=keycodes+for+linux
2011-02-15T17:37:00.000Z	Djlbert		thanks
2011-02-15T17:40:00.000Z	Djlbert		how can i get xev to monitor js0
2011-02-15T17:45:00.000Z	Djlbert	th0r	when I press buttons on my xbox controller nothing comes up in xev
