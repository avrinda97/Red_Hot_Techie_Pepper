2010-08-14T15:10:00.000Z	Friar		hello, I want to add my /home/user/programs directory to the list of directories that I can execute programs from without typing out the entire directory. I believe there is a list of these paths somewhere...Does anyone know where that is?
2010-08-14T15:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	Friar	use  /home/user/bin instead of /home/user/programs and it will authomatically added
2010-08-14T15:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	Friar	see the /home/user/.profile  file. in there they set up ~/bin
2010-08-14T15:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	Friar	yes you can rename
2010-08-14T15:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	Friar	you have to reopen the terminal
2010-08-14T15:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	Friar	and the file has to have executable permissions
2010-08-14T15:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	Friar	run « source ~/.profile »
2010-08-14T15:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	Friar	ok then do « « source ~/.profile »
2010-08-14T15:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	Friar	third time is the charm ? ---> run "source ~/.profile"
2010-08-14T15:24:00.000Z	Friar	erUSUL	what does that command do? I know I should have asked before I ran it, but it worked and I wonder what it did.
2010-08-14T15:24:00.000Z	erUSUL	Friar	it reads the file and "execute" it in the current shell
2010-08-14T15:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	Friar	if you rwead the file you see it is there where the path is set. and where ~/bin/ is included
2010-09-05T15:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	Friar	your keys should be in your home folder ~/.ssh/ ? make a backup of your home
2010-09-05T15:19:00.000Z	Friar	erUSUL	that is indeed where my keys are located. so If I just make a copy of ~/.ssh and replace the default one it should be ok?
2010-09-05T15:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	Friar	should be
2010-09-05T15:20:00.000Z	Friar	erUSUL	thanks. I think I'll make the server accept passwords before I upgrade as well just to be on the safe side...I don't have physical access to my server at the moment. I'm in europe for 6 months for work, and the server is at my parents house back in the states.
2010-09-05T15:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	Friar	ok;: good luck
2010-09-15T19:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	Friar	so you leave the limbo and enter the real channel
2010-09-15T19:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	Friar	to avoid bots
2010-10-10T17:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	Friar	torrent clients already use "strong" checksumming ...
2010-10-10T17:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	Friar	yes; bt uses md4 afaik so should be ok. but using md5sum is quick
