2010-01-14T01:36:00.000Z	cor_r	hasanubuntu	just download the newest deb...since its based on certain other packets u will have to update anways, but to get the nweset would be from their site
2010-01-14T01:37:00.000Z	hasanubuntu	cor_r	still iam on ubuntu 8.04 can i install the newest vlc
2010-01-14T01:37:00.000Z	cor_r	hasanubuntu	as I just said, if you download it from their website instead from the the repos, yes
2010-01-14T01:38:00.000Z	cor_r	hasanubuntu	or you allow the testing or experimental repos to get it, i would not recommend that though
2010-01-14T01:38:00.000Z	hasanubuntu	cor_r	http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-sources.html i have the source so can i just install it
2010-01-14T01:38:00.000Z	cor_r	hasanubuntu	read that : http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-ubuntu.html
2010-01-14T01:42:00.000Z	hasanubuntu	cor_r	configure: error: Couldn't find DBus >= 1.0.0, install libdbus-dev ?
2010-01-14T01:43:00.000Z	cor_r	hasanubuntu	as I said: It probably wont work without update and/or upgrade...try installing dbus though
2010-01-14T01:43:00.000Z	hasanubuntu	cor_r	how i do that
2010-01-14T01:43:00.000Z	hasanubuntu		install dbus
2010-01-14T01:43:00.000Z	hasanubuntu		 sudo apt-get install libdbus
2010-01-14T01:43:00.000Z	hasanubuntu		 cannot find package
2010-01-14T01:45:00.000Z	cor_r	hasanubuntu	terminal--> sudo -s --> password --> apt-get install libdbus-dev , if u want to install dbus newest
2010-01-14T01:45:00.000Z	hasanubuntu		no such package
2010-01-14T01:49:00.000Z	cor_r	hasanubuntu	jeez then just do the update and upgrade and install vls via console
2010-01-14T01:50:00.000Z	hasanubuntu		no i have problem i re-installed ubuntu 10 times today when i upgrade i get black screen
2010-01-14T01:50:00.000Z	hasanubuntu		i will never upgrade
2010-01-14T01:51:00.000Z	cor_r	hasanubuntu	u could have just downloaded the newest version,its only 700mb...but well, then just do the update and intall vlc via console, probably wont be the newest though
