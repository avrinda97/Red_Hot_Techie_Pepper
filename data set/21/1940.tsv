2010-03-07T05:10:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	LameBucket	to create an xorg see http://sites.google.com/site/alucidfs/how-i-do/create-an-xorg-conf-file
2010-03-07T05:13:00.000Z	LameBucket	ZykoticK9	I am using an nvidia and so it tells me to do "sudo nvidia-xconfig" and when i run it it says that the command was not found..
2010-03-07T05:14:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	LameBucket	perhaps you don't have the nvidia driver/programs installed.  You can use the non-nvidia method right now.
2010-03-07T05:17:00.000Z	LameBucket	ZykoticK9	its still doing the same thing.. nothing is on the TV besides "Not Support!" after i did the non nvidia
2010-03-07T05:17:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	LameBucket	does it really say "Not Support!" that isn't even english really
2010-03-07T05:17:00.000Z	LameBucket	ZykoticK9	yes... it really says that..
2010-03-07T05:18:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	LameBucket	what sort of TV is this?
2010-03-07T05:19:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	LameBucket	what kind of cable is connecting the TV to the computer?
2010-03-07T05:19:00.000Z	LameBucket	ZykoticK9	VGA
2010-03-07T05:20:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	LameBucket	ummm, sorry man I have no idea.  Best of luck!
2010-03-07T05:20:00.000Z	LameBucket	ZykoticK9	and i know it will work.. because the computer came with Windows 7 on it and it works with that.. its just ubuntu is being a pain.
2010-03-07T05:21:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	LameBucket	have you tried installing the Nvidia drivers?
2010-03-07T05:22:00.000Z	LameBucket	ZykoticK9	how do i do that?
2010-03-07T05:22:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	LameBucket	try running "sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-185" from the command line (i'm not really sure that's the driver you need, but we can start there)
2010-03-07T05:23:00.000Z	LameBucket	ZykoticK9	its a NVIDIA® GeForce® 6150 SE
