2009-12-19T18:45:00.000Z	penguin42	Dr_Willis	Well, different
2009-12-19T18:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	penguin42	 what upstart commands.. theres 'sudo service SERVICENAME start/stop/restart/whatever'
2009-12-19T18:47:00.000Z	penguin42	Dr_Willis	What's the equivalent of update-rc.d ? And when I do initctl list I don't see the ssh entry even though I can see openssh-server has created a file in /etc/init.d
2009-12-19T18:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	penguin42	 thats easy.. there is none that ive seen..
2009-12-19T18:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	penguin42	  just because its in init.d dosent mean the sysv stuff is handling it.. check in /etc/init/
2009-12-19T18:47:00.000Z	penguin42	Dr_Willis	Oh right, erm - so what's the defined way of enabling a service to start at boot?
2009-12-19T18:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	penguin42	 if it has an entry in /etc/init/whatever.conf    it starts up.  change it to whatever.DONTRUN_conf or somehow alter the .conf and it wont startup
2009-12-19T18:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	penguin42	 one of the services in init  cheks the rc.2 stuff
2009-12-19T18:49:00.000Z	penguin42	Dr_Willis	Oh right - strange not having it wrapped by a command
2009-12-19T18:50:00.000Z	penguin42	Dr_Willis	So is it a bug that openssh-server doesn't come with a file for /etc/init ?
2010-10-17T16:56:00.000Z	penguin42	Dr_Willis	In what way does it break ?
2010-10-17T16:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	penguin42	 flashing cursor thats it....
2010-10-17T16:57:00.000Z	penguin42	Dr_Willis	Ouch, and how do you fix it - do you get Grub1 or 2 ?
2010-10-17T16:57:00.000Z	penguin42	Dr_Willis	Hang on, are you saying it keeps reinstalling grub to the flash drive instead of the hard drive?
2010-10-17T16:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	penguin42	 i can remove the flash drive after the system boots. and rerun update-grub and that has fixed it in the past.
2010-10-17T16:58:00.000Z	penguin42	Dr_Willis	What does /boot/grub/device.map look like?
2010-10-17T16:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	penguin42	 let me check.. i just ran sudo dpkg-reconfiogure grub-pc and its set to be on sdb. which is correct.. NOT sdc. which is the flash drive.. or sda whch is the windows drive. :)
2010-10-17T17:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	penguin42	 i dont even have a device.map :) does grub2 use that?
2010-10-17T17:03:00.000Z	penguin42	Dr_Willis	I think so, mine has it
2010-10-17T17:04:00.000Z	penguin42	Dr_Willis	Thought, have you got the right /boot mounted?
2010-10-17T17:06:00.000Z	penguin42	Dr_Willis	Try grub-mkdevicemap ?
