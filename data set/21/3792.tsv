2008-09-20T12:53:00.000Z	Flannel	sullyva86	LVM
2008-09-20T12:54:00.000Z	sullyva86	Flannel	What's LVM?
2008-09-20T12:54:00.000Z	Flannel	sullyva86	It gives you te abilities to abstract away your disks.
2008-09-20T12:56:00.000Z	Flannel	sullyva86	Unfortunately, yeah.  If youre looking to do it now, can I suggest moving /home to the second drive, and keeping the other one for your system
2008-09-20T12:58:00.000Z	sullyva86	Flannel	moving it to the 2nd partition why? Then won't i have to change the path in all my apps?
2008-09-20T12:59:00.000Z	Flannel	sullyva86	Nope.  Partitions are completely abstracted away, so you wont even know the difference (as far as usage is concerned)
2008-09-20T13:00:00.000Z	Flannel	sullyva86	That page walks ou through it, but assumes you're moving to a separate partition (on the same drive) instead of a partition on another drive.
2008-09-20T13:00:00.000Z	sullyva86	Flannel	So since nothing is on the 2nd partiton i just reformat that partition as lvm?
2008-09-20T13:00:00.000Z	sullyva86	Flannel	It is the same drive
2008-09-20T13:00:00.000Z	Flannel	sullyva86	Nah, LVM will only work if both are lvm-ized
2008-09-20T13:00:00.000Z	Flannel	sullyva86	ah.  !  You can just remove the second partition and expand your current partition
2008-09-20T13:00:00.000Z	sullyva86	Flannel	So I'm f'ed then I should just mount it?
2008-09-20T13:01:00.000Z	Flannel	sullyva86	What?  no.  Just... boot a liveCD and expand your linux partition.
2008-09-20T13:01:00.000Z	sullyva86	Flannel	I tried to do that before in gparted. I had a bunch of freespace from shrinking my vista partition but couldn't figure it out lol
2008-09-20T13:01:00.000Z	Flannel	sullyva86	Feel free to ask the channel for help when you need it.  But that would be your best course of action.
2008-09-20T13:02:00.000Z	sullyva86	Flannel	It would only allow me to create a new one or shrink my current ubuntu partition.
2008-09-20T13:02:00.000Z	Flannel	sullyva86	you first have to delete the other one.  Then expand
2008-09-20T13:03:00.000Z	sullyva86	Flannel	Is there some other button i pick for expand. Cuz it was just freespace and wouldn't let me expand the ubuntu partition for some reason.
2008-09-20T13:04:00.000Z	Flannel	sullyva86	well, you can only expand ext3 partitions backwards, not fowards directly.  But gparted should be able to do the workarounds automatically to resize whereever.
2008-09-20T13:06:00.000Z	sullyva86	Flannel	I read something about having to move the partition in front of the free space be able to expand it so I guess i'll try that thanks.
