2009-08-06T08:51:00.000Z	gvsa123		i forgot how to do this... but i can't see my windows shared folder in the ubuntu side of samba...
2009-08-06T08:51:00.000Z	Ghoti	gvsa123	places -> connect to server
2009-08-06T08:52:00.000Z	gvsa123	Ghoti	i don't get that part...
2009-08-06T08:52:00.000Z	Ghoti	gvsa123	you want to connect from your ubuntu box to a Windows share, yes?
2009-08-06T08:52:00.000Z	gvsa123	Ghoti	i installed system-config-samba
2009-08-06T08:53:00.000Z	gvsa123	Ghoti	yep... i can see the ubuntu shared folder in xp, but not the other way around
2009-08-06T08:53:00.000Z	Ghoti	gvsa123	okay, on the ubuntu box, go to the Places menu, and select Connect to Server
2009-08-06T08:54:00.000Z	Ghoti	gvsa123	'service type' would ve Windows Share
2009-08-06T08:54:00.000Z	gvsa123	Ghoti	and the rest?
2009-08-06T08:55:00.000Z	Ghoti	gvsa123	'Server' would be the address of your server (e. g. 192.168.1.5'), 'share' is the name of the share, 'folder' is the subdirectory of the share you want to mount, usename is, well, the username, and the domain is the domain (or the workgroup) of the Windows box
2009-08-06T08:56:00.000Z	gvsa123	Ghoti	oh.. i have to know the ip of the other system now?
2009-08-06T08:56:00.000Z	Ghoti	gvsa123	you always need to know what you're connecting *to* when you're making these sorts of connections
2009-08-06T08:57:00.000Z	gvsa123	Ghoti	how come it used to be that i just configure it and then on ubuntu, go to places>network and then the workgroup computers would appear there...
2009-08-06T08:58:00.000Z	Ghoti	gvsa123	 you could try places -> network, but it's a lot easier if you know the info that you fill into the 'connect to server' box, at least for me.  As always, there's more than one way to skin a metaphorical cat
2009-08-06T08:59:00.000Z	gvsa123	Ghoti	hmm,... the other users might find the other way confusing. how can i set it up so that any system connected to the mshome domain would appear?
2009-08-06T08:59:00.000Z	Ghoti	gvsa123	it's been a long time since I've dealt with a lot of Windows shares like that, so that's a bit out of my depth I'm afraid
2009-08-06T08:59:00.000Z	gvsa123	Ghoti	oh.. that's odd... it's there now.
2009-08-06T09:09:00.000Z	gvsa123	Ghoti	yeah... they can see each other now... didn't really do anything... but they do.. thanks anyway...
2009-08-06T09:09:00.000Z	Ghoti	gvsa123	glad to (sort of) have helped! :)
2009-08-06T09:10:00.000Z	gvsa123	Ghoti	np... i know the last time i used ubuntu, i had to modify smb.conf... and then after some releases, system-config-samba did everything... so i was wondering what was going on now.... finally have a permanent box i can run ubuntu on... :)
2009-08-06T09:11:00.000Z	Ghoti	gvsa123	yay! \o/
