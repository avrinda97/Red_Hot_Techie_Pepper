2012-11-10T00:44:00.000Z	Aha2Y	kunji	How you mean normal install?
2012-11-10T00:44:00.000Z	Aha2Y		univeral USB installer at ubuntu.com
2012-11-10T00:46:00.000Z	kunji	Aha2Y	Using the installer as you would when installing to a an HDD.  That is you can just use the built in startup disk creator packaged with Ubuntu to make a liveUSB, or just use a liveCD, but then use that to actually install onto another USB drive as you would do for an HDD.
2012-11-10T00:47:00.000Z	Aha2Y		oh
2012-11-10T00:50:00.000Z	kunji	Aha2Y	Oh, you're starting from being in windows?  Yeah use the Universal USB Installer to make the liveUSB, and then use that to install to a USB drive.  Assuming you want a persistant proper installation on the USB drive.  If you just want a liveUSB, then just stop after making that, I think they have some persistent file storage when made this way, but not for installed programs, etc...
2012-11-10T00:50:00.000Z	Aha2Y		Yes that.
2012-11-10T00:50:00.000Z	Aha2Y		:P
2012-11-10T00:50:00.000Z	Aha2Y		I don't want Ubuntu (installed at USB) use my personal HDD.
2012-11-10T00:52:00.000Z	kunji	Aha2Y	It doesn't need to use your internal HDD as long as you don't install it to the internal HDD.
2012-11-10T00:52:00.000Z	Aha2Y		nice.
2012-11-10T00:52:00.000Z	Aha2Y		Would 8GB be enough?
2012-11-10T00:52:00.000Z	kunji	Aha2Y	Yep, unless you want to install lotsa software
2012-11-10T00:54:00.000Z	kunji		!swap
2012-11-10T00:54:00.000Z	Aha2Y	kunji	If i got a 8GB usb how big should i set the Presistent file size for storing changes?
2012-11-10T00:56:00.000Z	kunji	Aha2Y	Are you intending to use the 8 GB usb as the final place for Ubuntu to be installed, or for the liveUSB to do the installation?
2012-11-10T00:57:00.000Z	Aha2Y	kunji	http://owely.com/4dYtqn <-
2012-11-10T00:57:00.000Z	Aha2Y		I have no idea :P
2012-11-10T00:59:00.000Z	kunji	Aha2Y	My impression was that you wanted an actual install of Ubuntu.  So you will need either 2 USB drives, one to use for the liveUSB, and the other to install to as you would for an HDD.  Or alternatively a USB and a blank cd, in which case you would make a liveCD and use that to install to the USB drive, again as you would to an HDD.
2012-11-10T00:59:00.000Z	Aha2Y		Nah just a USB installation :o
2012-11-10T01:01:00.000Z	kunji	Aha2Y	Oh, so just a liveUSB then?  You won't be able to keep programs installed across reboots though that way.  In that case I would set the size of the persistent partition to 4 GB on a 8 GB drive, or as high as they let you go (I think the creator will not let you leave too little space for the OS), should give ample space for documents and the like, which will remain across reboots.
