2012-08-04T10:12:00.000Z	Maiz_en_Heces		is it okay to talk about diarrhea in here?
2012-08-04T10:12:00.000Z	Maiz_en_Heces		if it relates to open source ubuntu applications
2012-08-04T10:12:00.000Z	Maiz_en_Heces		for diarrhea analysis?
2012-08-04T10:12:00.000Z	theadmin	Maiz_en_Heces	If the app is in the Ubuntu repos, and you need support for that app, I guess yes.
2012-08-04T10:13:00.000Z	Maiz_en_Heces	theadmin	 how do I get diarrhea splash connoisseur into the repository?
2012-08-04T10:13:00.000Z	Maiz_en_Heces		it is a program that analyzes a pic of the diarrhea
2012-08-04T10:13:00.000Z	Maiz_en_Heces		and suggests recipes
2012-08-04T10:13:00.000Z	Maiz_en_Heces		and sexual acts
2012-08-04T10:14:00.000Z	theadmin	Maiz_en_Heces	Uh, if it's not currently in the official repositories we can't support it. You just said it's not, from what I understand.
2012-08-04T10:14:00.000Z	Maiz_en_Heces		no... I am the devolper
2012-08-04T10:14:00.000Z	Maiz_en_Heces		and I want to add it to the repository
2012-08-04T10:14:00.000Z	Maiz_en_Heces		the app works like this
2012-08-04T10:14:00.000Z	Maiz_en_Heces		you take a plastic sheet
2012-08-04T10:14:00.000Z	Maiz_en_Heces		and you spray your diarrhea all over it
2012-08-04T10:14:00.000Z	Maiz_en_Heces		then you take a pic
2012-08-04T10:14:00.000Z	Maiz_en_Heces		and then you load it into the program
2012-08-04T10:14:00.000Z	theadmin	Maiz_en_Heces	Well, we don't care how the app works
2012-08-04T10:15:00.000Z	Maiz_en_Heces		it then generates ideas on how you can prepare it for human consumption
2012-08-04T10:15:00.000Z	Maiz_en_Heces		so how do I add it to the repo?
2012-08-04T10:15:00.000Z	Maiz_en_Heces		or how are apps added to the repo?
2012-08-04T10:16:00.000Z	theadmin	Maiz_en_Heces	Development questions are for #ubuntu-devel, but generally you can create your own repo (a ppa) at Launchpad
