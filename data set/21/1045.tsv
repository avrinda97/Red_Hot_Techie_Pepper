2011-04-03T05:36:00.000Z	tristan325		i really like it and want to install
2011-04-03T05:36:00.000Z	tristan325		but i'm having trouble deciding on the install
2011-04-03T05:36:00.000Z	tristan325		thought i'd jump on and get some advice
2011-04-03T05:36:00.000Z	tristan325		do you guys have a moment?
2011-04-03T05:36:00.000Z	Jasonn	tristan325	How are you having trouble?
2011-04-03T05:37:00.000Z	Jasonn	tristan325	Do you want to install it instead of, or with your other operating system?
2011-04-03T05:40:00.000Z	Jasonn	tristan325	How much drive space do you want to allocate to ubuntu?
2011-04-03T05:40:00.000Z	Jasonn	tristan325	How much drive space do you want to allocate to ubuntu?
2011-04-03T05:40:00.000Z	Jasonn	tristan325	It needs 5 to run properly
2011-04-03T05:41:00.000Z	Jasonn	tristan325	It needs 5GB for system files, and then what ever else you want
2011-04-03T05:41:00.000Z	Jasonn	tristan325	give it 15GB
2011-04-03T05:42:00.000Z	Jasonn	tristan325	the right is ubuntu, the left is windows
2011-04-03T05:43:00.000Z	Jasonn	tristan325	thats because its gonna use the empty drive
2011-04-03T05:44:00.000Z	Jasonn	tristan325	Its asking you how much space you need for yer crap on ubuntu, and how much crap for windows
2011-04-03T05:44:00.000Z	Jasonn	tristan325	You need to select how much space you want ubuntu to have
2011-04-03T05:45:00.000Z	Jasonn	tristan325	Typically, ubuntu should use 4-5GB for system files, depending if you update while install
2011-04-03T05:45:00.000Z	Jasonn	tristan325	Give it 40GB for ubuntu, that should be more than enough
2011-04-03T05:46:00.000Z	Jasonn	tristan325	Give it 40GB for ubuntu, that should be more than enough
