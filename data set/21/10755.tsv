2004-11-19T11:28:00.000Z	|QuaD|		hmm
2004-11-19T11:28:00.000Z	|QuaD|		considering changing to ubuntu
2004-11-19T11:29:00.000Z	|QuaD|		heh, i have used kde for 4 years now :( but i really want to try ubuntu... i have ONLY heard good things about it
2004-11-19T11:30:00.000Z	|QuaD|		during the initial instilation does it load gnome... or is it more like a debian net install?
2004-11-19T11:31:00.000Z	|QuaD|		is there a list of packages it automatically puts on?
2004-11-19T11:31:00.000Z	Witigonen	|QuaD|	I usually prefer KDE as well, but on Ubuntu, gnome is just better.  I recommend trying Ubuntu with gnome for a little while, if you can't get used to it at all, then try it with KDE.
2004-11-19T11:32:00.000Z	|QuaD|	Witigonen	can you give me a reason why?
2004-11-19T11:34:00.000Z	Witigonen	|QuaD|	Well, for one, it is the latest version of gnome- that's really, really nice.  One of the main reasons I prefer KDE, the use of my multimedia keys on the keyboard, I just set up with Gnome and it works great.  So that's awesome.  Also, gDesklets is better than superkaramba if you're into that stuff at all.  And, yeah, it just looks amazing.
2004-11-19T11:37:00.000Z	Witigonen	|QuaD|	sorry, don't know.  Not that many are actually installed WITH Ubuntu (it only comes on one CD, after all) but there are a ton that you can install once you get it running.  Debian packages, after all.
2004-11-19T11:41:00.000Z	|QuaD|	Witigonen	dependencies
2004-11-19T11:42:00.000Z	|QuaD|	Witigonen	i can't find a way to install a bittorrent app because it doesn't believe it has python ncurses installed
2004-11-19T11:44:00.000Z	|QuaD|	Witigonen	i have a suse 9.2 license (legal) i am not using it anymore... if you want i can send you the isos
2004-11-19T11:44:00.000Z	Witigonen	|QuaD|	I was thinking just the other night of installing SuSE.
2004-11-19T11:45:00.000Z	|QuaD|	Witigonen	want the isos?
2004-11-19T11:45:00.000Z	Witigonen	|QuaD|	Sure.
2004-11-19T11:45:00.000Z	Witigonen	|QuaD|	if I don't use them, I'm sure somebody from my local lug will.
2004-11-19T11:46:00.000Z	|QuaD|	Witigonen	can i pm you?
2004-11-19T11:46:00.000Z	Witigonen	|QuaD|	of course.
2004-11-19T11:54:00.000Z	Witigonen	|QuaD|	having no experience with Debian itself (except for one really bad night back in the eighth grade with a 486) so I can't say.  I'm enjoying it, though.
2004-11-19T11:58:00.000Z	Witigonen	|QuaD|	shouldn't take more than half an hour.  Fifteen minutes?  Ten?
