2012-07-15T16:28:00.000Z	pckchem	db_loco	you can give nautilus (GUI) admin permissions by running it from terminal with SUDO. Just be very very careful.
2012-07-15T16:28:00.000Z	pckchem	db_loco	so open terminal and type ~:sudo nautilus
2012-07-15T16:29:00.000Z	db_loco	pckchem	is there a command to revert the permissions once i am finished fixing the file?
2012-07-15T16:30:00.000Z	pckchem	db_loco	Sure, you should be able to change it from nautilus right after you move the file
2012-07-15T16:30:00.000Z	pckchem	db_loco	right click-> properties->permissions
2012-07-15T16:30:00.000Z	db_loco	pckchem	excellent - so here it goes :s
2012-07-15T16:36:00.000Z	db_loco	pckchem	Thanks muchly - that worked fine
2012-07-15T16:36:00.000Z	db_loco	pckchem	once i closed the page the permissionsreverted
2012-07-15T16:37:00.000Z	pckchem	db_loco	You mean your elevated nautilus session? Yes, you'll have to restart it with sudo again.
2012-07-15T16:37:00.000Z	pckchem	db_loco	Or do you mean the file permissions?
2012-07-15T16:37:00.000Z	db_loco	pckchem	thanks
2012-07-15T16:39:00.000Z	db_loco	pckchem	sorry yes i meant the session.  Once i run it it came up with an error but still opened the folders session and i had permissions to update the files.  Once i closed the windows page, and re-opened it, i noticed the permissions to change files was gone.
2012-07-15T16:42:00.000Z	pckchem	db_loco	I *think* by the windows page you mean Nautilus, which is the file-manager (windows explorer equivalant) in Ubuntu. I know it can be confusing to learn separate names for seemingly core parts of the OS, but Linux is like that, and if you remember them and use them, a side benefit is that we can help you much easier, and moreover, you can search for answers to your questions on google much easier ;)
2012-07-15T16:43:00.000Z	db_loco	pckchem	that makes lots of sense - thanks a lot
2012-07-15T16:44:00.000Z	pckchem	db_loco	You may also be interested in changing the file ownership, so that you don't have to use elevated permissions. Check out this: http://www.liberiangeek.net/2010/12/change-ownership-filesfolders-ubuntu-10-10-maverick-meerkat/
2012-07-15T16:44:00.000Z	pckchem	db_loco	It's for an older version but I looked it over, it's still solid instructions.
2012-07-15T16:49:00.000Z	db_loco	pckchem	thanks.  Do you know the code to open the monitor lists?  i think it is rndr - q, but I can;t recall anymore :s
2012-07-15T16:51:00.000Z	pckchem	db_loco	Just ask what you want to do.... there are some old ways of doing things that have been improved and I don't want to lead you astray ;)
2012-07-15T16:53:00.000Z	db_loco	pckchem	alright. I want to know the resolution which is set for the login screen.  After an upgrade, i found that the login page is blank with 'input not supported' all over the place.  i need to find the resolution which that page is set at eventually
2012-07-15T16:54:00.000Z	pckchem	db_loco	yikes, messy update. I haven't messed with those settings in a long time, I'm afraid I can't help you other than with my google-foo.
2012-07-15T16:55:00.000Z	db_loco	pckchem	thats fair enough.  not to worry. I will try to research what i found before.  I am just adding my solution to the forum post i placed before, so hopefully thiw ill help others ;)
