2007-12-17T22:52:00.000Z	mgim		im downgrading to ubuntu 2.4 from 2.6
2007-12-17T22:52:00.000Z	mgim		yes, sorry
2007-12-17T22:52:00.000Z	mgim		kernel from 2.6 to 2.4
2007-12-17T22:53:00.000Z	mgim		ok so let me start over
2007-12-17T22:53:00.000Z	mgim		i need to have kernel 2.4 due to some old drivers that are 2.4 kernel only
2007-12-17T22:53:00.000Z	mgim		whats the best way to do this? I'm getting errors in the include.h when make clean
2007-12-17T22:53:00.000Z	mgim		why not?
2007-12-17T22:54:00.000Z	mgim		so i need to switch flavors
2007-12-17T22:54:00.000Z	mgim		that makes sense, Flannel
2007-12-17T22:56:00.000Z	mgim		what distribution would be better for kernel 2.4?
2007-12-17T22:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	mgim	Try an older copy of Knoppix.. it wasnt too bad.. or MAybe even Mepis
2007-12-18T22:15:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	mgim	do ou have the v & H rates in there for your monitor?  Post your xorg to the pastebin not in channel
2007-12-18T22:15:00.000Z	mgim	Jack_Sparrow	just a moment
2007-12-18T22:20:00.000Z	mgim	Jack_Sparrow	i've got in paste.. whats the link I can give to you to see it?
2007-12-18T22:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	mgim	once you paste the link is at the top of the page
2007-12-18T22:20:00.000Z	mgim	Jack_Sparrow	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/48700/
2007-12-18T22:21:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	mgim	Are those your rates or just a default set.. ie.. did you verify your specs with that one
2007-12-18T22:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	mgim	I would start there... and parhaps drop the depth from 24 to 16 just for a test..
2007-12-18T22:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	mgim	It could be the problem..  and yes, please come back.. welcome to Ubuntu
2007-12-18T22:29:00.000Z	mgim	Jack_Sparrow	et al.: I changed the horizontal and vertical sync settings per the specifications of the manufacturer (http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/monitors/1702fp/en/specs.htm) and also the bit to 16
2007-12-18T22:31:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	mgim	Ok... I am a little preoccupied today but others can help  thanks Baltazaar
