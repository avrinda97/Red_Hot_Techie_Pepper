2009-11-10T10:00:00.000Z	migg137	greezmunkey	well just the macchanger to change the mack to whatever you want it to
2009-11-21T12:15:00.000Z	greezmunkey	migg137	I am setting up an XP session in VB now. I've done some reading on that, and I guess it is possible, but pretty hairy.
2009-11-21T12:17:00.000Z	migg137	greezmunkey	so how do i set up just an otdinary windows on it... do i need like an xp iso or something
2009-11-21T12:17:00.000Z	greezmunkey	migg137	I installed off of a CD
2009-11-21T12:18:00.000Z	migg137	greezmunkey	well i dont have a cd so il have to try an iso, also will it run with al features or what are the things it wont do
2009-11-21T12:20:00.000Z	greezmunkey	migg137	it runs as if it is on dedicated hardware as far as I can tell. I have a VB set up on this laptop, and run MS office within it just fine. One thing though, VB currently doesn't support GRE, so pptp vpn's are out of the question. I do have a way around it though ;)
2009-11-21T12:21:00.000Z	migg137	greezmunkey	 im sorry but i dont know what GRE is im not that advanced yet lol
2009-11-21T12:23:00.000Z	greezmunkey	migg137	np, you use that on XP to vpn back to your network at work mostly, VB won't do it yet, but they just released a new vresion, maybe it's in there now. (I donno)
2009-11-21T12:25:00.000Z	migg137	greezmunkey	 ok im going to download xp iso now since i run many things on windows and im tired of booting back and forth
2009-11-21T12:26:00.000Z	greezmunkey	migg137	you go ahead on WYBS, but spend some quiet time with the docs to see if you can incorporate an already installed system. It would be good to know how to do!
2009-11-21T12:31:00.000Z	migg137	greezmunkey	 yeah il look into that tomorrow if i have timen where i am it is 1:30 am and just got back from out of state so i  pretty tired
2009-11-21T12:34:00.000Z	migg137	greezmunkey	thats cool, so i cna run my softwarte just fine right like fl studio, sony vegas adn photoshop?
2009-11-21T12:35:00.000Z	greezmunkey	migg137	no guarantees, you'll have to try it.
2009-11-21T12:36:00.000Z	greezmunkey	migg137	remember you have to run VB as root (unfortunately)
2009-11-21T12:37:00.000Z	greezmunkey	migg137	uh...I think I'll take that back, there was a reason for doing so, but it seems to work anyway on this updated install...
2009-11-21T12:38:00.000Z	migg137	greezmunkey	ok so it should be fine i just downloaded today
2009-11-21T12:39:00.000Z	greezmunkey	migg137	yea, I would think so. I installed onto this server from an aptoncd that I burned off of this laptop. I'll update it later...
2009-11-21T12:40:00.000Z	migg137	greezmunkey	thats cool man i still have alot to learn, i just recently got ubuntu this yea and i love it
2009-11-21T12:41:00.000Z	greezmunkey	migg137	well later, see ya in here.
