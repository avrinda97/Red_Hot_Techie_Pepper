2010-06-01T01:19:00.000Z	gash05	minimec	yeah my wireless isn't working on my Dell Latitude X300 with ubuntu 9.10
2010-06-01T01:20:00.000Z	minimec	gash05	What do you mean with not working? That module is in the kernel for years...
2010-06-01T01:22:00.000Z	gash05	minimec	it's not detecting my network
2010-06-01T01:22:00.000Z	minimec	gash05	open a terminal and type iwconfig in it...
2010-06-01T01:26:00.000Z	minimec	gash05	Check signal strength and quality...
2010-06-01T01:26:00.000Z	gash05	minimec	sorry for the late reply, i get the output: lo        no wireless extensions.

2010-06-01T01:28:00.000Z	minimec	gash05	ok. what is the output of lspci for the wifi card? Just the line for the wifi card.

2010-06-01T01:32:00.000Z	gash05	minimec	there was no wifi output
2010-06-01T01:33:00.000Z	minimec	gash05	That is the wifi output... ;)
2010-06-01T01:34:00.000Z	gash05	minimec	i see. so what now?
2010-06-01T01:35:00.000Z	minimec	gash05	Just tell me why do you want to install an intel 2200BG driver (which is already installed), if you don't even need one?
2010-06-01T01:36:00.000Z	gash05	minimec	because my wireless isn't working - or do i need a different driver?

2010-06-01T01:37:00.000Z	minimec	gash05	search for your card in combination with 'ubuntu' or '10.04' 'lucid'
2010-06-01T01:38:00.000Z	gash05	minimec	LOL, thanks
2010-06-01T01:38:00.000Z	minimec	gash05	No problem ;)
