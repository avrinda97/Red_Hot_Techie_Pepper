2009-04-27T05:02:00.000Z	linduxed		ive just installed awesome3.1.1 in jaunty with a "make && sudo make install", is there a way to reverse the process?
2009-04-27T05:02:00.000Z	mzz	linduxed	not generally, although if you still have that dir "make uninstall" *might* work
2009-04-27T05:03:00.000Z	mzz	linduxed	(this is why "sudo make install" is not your friend, and things like fakeroot hopefully are)
2009-04-27T05:04:00.000Z	linduxed	mzz	is there a way to track what files are installed during a make install process?
2009-04-27T05:04:00.000Z	linduxed	mzz	that way i could nuke the files manually?
2009-04-27T05:05:00.000Z	mzz	linduxed	fakeroot
2009-04-27T05:05:00.000Z	mzz	linduxed	let me try to find a page describing this
2009-04-27T05:15:00.000Z	linduxed	mzz	any luck on that fakeroot page? im looking around... but i dont know what to look for :/
2009-04-27T05:15:00.000Z	mzz	linduxed	thanks for the reminder, looking again now
2009-04-27T05:20:00.000Z	linduxed	mzz	ok so now i know what fakeroot is, but i dont see how that should help me
2009-04-27T05:20:00.000Z	mzz	linduxed	I was wrong about the name, hang on
2009-04-27T05:21:00.000Z	mzz	linduxed	I think what I actually used was checkinstall, not fakeroot. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingEasyHowTo
2009-05-12T00:08:00.000Z	mzz	linduxed	it'll figure out z automagically, but you need f (it's waiting for you to supply the file on stdin without that)
2009-07-12T16:19:00.000Z	mzz	linduxed	is the problem with the media key or with the command? If you bind the command to something simple like ctrl+alt+m does it work?
2009-07-12T16:21:00.000Z	linduxed	mzz	jrib: the command is correct (mpc next) and if i bind it to something "non-XF86......" then it works
2009-07-12T16:22:00.000Z	mzz	linduxed	that's very weird (you are binding by simply hitting that key, right?)
2009-07-12T16:22:00.000Z	mzz	linduxed	it's possible some running media player eats the key, but I don't understand why the keybinding manager still does pick it up
2009-07-12T16:23:00.000Z	linduxed	mzz	yupp
2009-07-12T16:25:00.000Z	linduxed	mzz	nope, no media player eating keys now
2009-07-20T00:29:00.000Z	mzz	linduxed	deluser, possibly with -m, iirc. Read the manpage first.
2009-07-20T00:29:00.000Z	mzz	linduxed	err, sorry, userdel
