2012-07-06T01:04:00.000Z	melkor		Is there a way to restart X from a tty without having to close all of my running programs?
2012-07-06T01:04:00.000Z	bekks	melkor	No.
2012-09-22T16:44:00.000Z	bekks	melkor	run sudo blkid -g; sudo blkid
2012-09-22T16:44:00.000Z	bekks	melkor	What happened to it?
2012-09-22T16:44:00.000Z	melkor	bekks	not a clue, last night it worked and today only the ntfs partitions are still alive.
2012-09-22T16:46:00.000Z	melkor	bekks	still doesn't find the partition.
2012-09-22T16:48:00.000Z	bekks	melkor	Then pastebin the output of sudo blkid please
2012-09-22T16:50:00.000Z	melkor	bekks	^
2012-09-22T16:51:00.000Z	bekks	melkor	And which partition is missing from your point of view?
2012-09-22T16:52:00.000Z	melkor	bekks	gparted claims that sdc6 is unknown file system of 101G last night it was ext4.
2012-09-22T16:52:00.000Z	bekks	melkor	Then pastebin sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdc please
2012-09-22T16:55:00.000Z	bekks	melkor	So what have you done then? :)
2012-09-22T16:55:00.000Z	melkor	bekks	I have no clue, at the worste I unplugged it w/out ejecting the device.
2012-09-22T16:56:00.000Z	melkor	bekks	oh, I turned off the computer with the device plugged in and then unplugged it.
2012-09-22T16:56:00.000Z	bekks	melkor	That wont change the partitioning scheme.
2012-09-22T16:56:00.000Z	bekks	melkor	And it was ext4 yesterday?
2012-09-22T16:59:00.000Z	bekks	melkor	sdc6 was ext4 yesterday?
2012-09-22T16:59:00.000Z	melkor	bekks	it could have been sdc4
2012-09-22T17:00:00.000Z	bekks	melkor	No.
2012-09-22T17:00:00.000Z	bekks	melkor	Powering off NEVER changes the partitioning scheme.
2012-09-22T17:00:00.000Z	melkor	bekks	I used fsck.ext4 on /dev/sdc6 and it seems to have repair something, right now it is checking for bad sectors though.
