2008-05-11T12:58:00.000Z	Becker_11		Hi I've installed the boinc packages via apt-get in the terminal but now I have no idea how to get it running or enter my details etc
2008-05-11T12:59:00.000Z	lartza_	Becker_11	From menu check for boinc manager
2008-05-11T12:59:00.000Z	Becker_11	lartza_	it's not there
2008-05-11T12:59:00.000Z	lartza_	Becker_11	Applications > System Tools
2008-05-11T13:00:00.000Z	Becker_11	lartza_	only got apt key manager there
2008-05-11T13:01:00.000Z	lartza_	Becker_11	sudo apt-get install boinc-manager boinc-client
2008-05-11T13:02:00.000Z	Becker_11	lartza_	 thanks doing it now
2008-05-11T13:02:00.000Z	lartza_	Becker_11	Np, do you have accounts for boinc projects? AAnd remember graphics don't wokr(atleast on seti) in linux
2008-05-11T13:03:00.000Z	Becker_11	lartza_	 yeah I do with Seti shame about graphics but thats life.
2008-05-11T13:04:00.000Z	lartza_	Becker_11	Atleast when I last time used the graphics didn't work. You can click the buton to the end of your life, but no graphics showed for me.
2008-05-11T13:05:00.000Z	Becker_11	lartza_	I'm a newly converted windoze user and very happy with it.
2008-05-11T13:06:00.000Z	lartza_	Becker_11	Glad you remembered me about BOINC :) I forgot I installed it.
2008-05-11T13:06:00.000Z	Becker_11	lartza_	np
2008-05-11T13:16:00.000Z	Becker_11	lartza_	 yeah I think rsi would be more likely than graphics on seti lol ... I clicked several times
2008-05-11T13:21:00.000Z	lartza_	Becker_11	You can get graphics
2008-05-11T13:21:00.000Z	lartza_	Becker_11	But in my computer when other programs running same time as boinc ti's slow
2008-05-11T13:21:00.000Z	Becker_11	lartza_	how?
2008-05-11T13:22:00.000Z	lartza_	Becker_11	run sudo xhost +si:localuser:boinc
2008-05-11T13:22:00.000Z	lartza_	Becker_11	Then System-Preferences-Sessions-Startup Programs
2008-05-11T13:23:00.000Z	lartza_	Becker_11	Add sudo xhost +si:localuser:boinc there as command, not name
2008-05-11T13:24:00.000Z	lartza_	Becker_11	That should do it.
