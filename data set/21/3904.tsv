2008-09-02T13:39:00.000Z	zcat[1]		Thank you!! -window root was what I couldn't figure out!
2008-09-02T13:40:00.000Z	zcat[1]		been driving me nuts though.. the man page seemed to be saying -root and that wasn't working
2008-09-02T13:40:00.000Z	zcat[1]		sorry, no.. -screen but that wasn't working ..
2008-09-02T13:41:00.000Z	zcat[1]		anyway, I have what I need now .. bloody hard to get screenshots of some programs when they take over the keyboard, eg frets on fire or stepmania ..
2008-09-02T13:42:00.000Z	zcat[1]		Yes, which is why we want the screenshot on our big SFD poster
2008-09-02T13:43:00.000Z	zcat[1]		btw anyone else here doing stuff for sfd?
2008-09-02T13:43:00.000Z	zcat[1]		software freedom day
2008-09-02T13:43:00.000Z	zcat[1]		the day after tlapd
2008-09-02T13:44:00.000Z	zcat[1]		!ohmy
2008-09-02T13:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	zcat[1]	try mesuggah in your frets of fire for a real challenge
2008-09-02T14:02:00.000Z	zcat[1]	ActionParsnip1	not really. try installing something you don't have the driver CD for ... in Linux some hardware is a bit difficult. In windows if you don't have the drivers (eg manufacturer never updated them) it's simply impossible..
2008-09-02T14:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	zcat[1]	but you can hit the manufacturers site and you know they'll have a windows driver, not so many with linux drivers
2008-09-02T14:05:00.000Z	zcat[1]	ActionParsnip1	I have quite a lot of hardware here that simply has no drivers, they dropped the download since they no longer sell that hardware, sometimes the manuf. isn't even in business any more..
2008-09-02T14:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	zcat[1]	some does, some doesnt, it all depends
2008-09-02T14:07:00.000Z	zcat[1]	ActionParsnip1	well, I tend to pick up hardware from WIndows users because they updated or reinstalled and can't find the drivers to make it work... I get a lot of hardware that way and most of it works fine in linux
2009-04-12T02:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	zcat[1]	i think you will have to boot to livecd, chroot to the installed system and apt-get the kernel
2009-04-12T02:12:00.000Z	zcat[1]	ActionParsnip1	yep that's what the howto says.. livecd's finished booting, brb..
2009-04-12T02:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	zcat[1]	you can get a feel of what the OS is about though
2009-04-12T02:32:00.000Z	zcat[1]	ActionParsnip1	well, kinda.. you get a feel for what it's like with windows hardware performance, minimal generic hardware support, and no 3d
2009-04-12T02:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	zcat[1]	true but you can install apps and stuff but i get your point
2009-04-12T02:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	zcat[1]	try powering off for 10 mins or so
