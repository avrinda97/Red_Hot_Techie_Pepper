2008-02-11T15:15:00.000Z	ubud		is is recommned to use restricted graphics driver for ubuntu?
2008-02-11T15:16:00.000Z	DrOnline	ubud	the answer to that question is more political than anything else, but if it works for you then it's probably best
2008-02-11T15:17:00.000Z	ubud	DrOnline	If I used the propietry driver, watching movies is jerging
2008-02-11T15:17:00.000Z	DrOnline	ubud	what driver are you using?
2008-02-11T15:18:00.000Z	DrOnline	ubud	n/m I need to learn to read up more
2008-02-11T15:18:00.000Z	DrOnline	ubud	the ATI driver shouldn't affect video
2008-02-11T15:19:00.000Z	ubud	DrOnline	the ubuntu build in no problem, but when use the restricted windows driver, problems will come
2008-02-11T15:19:00.000Z	DrOnline	ubud	the ubuntu built in driver is most likely the "vesa" driver.  If that works for you and you don't need hardware acceleration than I suggest you use that one
2008-02-11T15:21:00.000Z	DrOnline	ubud	hardware acceleration is using dedicated hardware to draw stuff on your screen (usually 3d graphics)
2008-02-11T15:23:00.000Z	DrOnline	ubud	then that is probably your best option
2008-02-11T15:23:00.000Z	ubud	DrOnline	how to tell what driver I am using now
2008-02-11T15:24:00.000Z	DrOnline	ubud	try typing 'cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf | grep Driver' into a terminal
2008-02-11T15:25:00.000Z	DrOnline	ubud	though chances are it will say 'fglrx'
2008-02-11T15:27:00.000Z	DrOnline	ubud	nv is the driver you're using then
2008-02-11T15:27:00.000Z	DrOnline	ubud	which is odd as you're using an ATI card
2008-02-11T15:28:00.000Z	DrOnline	ubud	or did I miss something
2008-02-11T15:28:00.000Z	ubud	DrOnline	When I reboot pc it always show nividia FX5200
2008-02-11T15:29:00.000Z	ubud	DrOnline	it is a HP P4 PC
2008-02-11T15:30:00.000Z	DrOnline	ubud	By the sounds of things, you're running an nVidia video card
2008-02-11T15:31:00.000Z	DrOnline	ubud	that's correct
