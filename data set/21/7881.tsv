2006-11-28T10:26:00.000Z	Amaranth	sanityx	nope, permission bug
2006-11-28T10:26:00.000Z	sanityx	Amaranth	Oh okay. How do you know? Im not challenging you, im curious.
2006-11-28T10:27:00.000Z	Amaranth	sanityx	And I'm the alacarte developer ;)
2006-11-28T10:27:00.000Z	sanityx	Amaranth	Ah. The sole developer?
2006-11-28T10:28:00.000Z	Amaranth	sanityx	yeah
2006-11-28T10:28:00.000Z	sanityx	Amaranth	well then let me thank you for making such a great app. now fix it! :-P
2006-11-28T10:31:00.000Z	sanityx	Amaranth	Yeah. I'm curious, why is Alacarte so slow? I dont mean that as a criticism, I'm sure its just some techincal limitation. But nontheless, how come?
2006-11-28T10:31:00.000Z	Amaranth	sanityx	it shouldn't be in edgy
2006-11-28T10:32:00.000Z	Amaranth	sanityx	loads in about 1 second on my (admittedly high-end) computer
2006-11-28T10:32:00.000Z	sanityx	Amaranth	I havent used 6.10 that much. I'll check it out once i get my new laptop tomorrow
2006-11-28T10:32:00.000Z	Amaranth	sanityx	6.06 was dog-slow because of the effort involved in reading the entire menu
2006-11-28T10:32:00.000Z	sanityx	Amaranth	Yeah it loads fine. But the response times are slow while its running.
2006-11-28T10:32:00.000Z	sanityx	Amaranth	So what changed in 6.10?
2006-11-28T10:32:00.000Z	Amaranth	sanityx	oh, right
2006-11-28T10:33:00.000Z	Amaranth	sanityx	I removed the nasty hacks that made it appear instant. In 6.06 it would pretend something happened and actually do it slightly later. In 6.10 it waits for the menu to say "this changed".
2006-11-28T10:33:00.000Z	sanityx	Amaranth	Why doesnt that make it even slower?
2006-11-28T10:33:00.000Z	Amaranth	sanityx	eh?
2006-11-28T10:33:00.000Z	Amaranth	sanityx	It does?
2006-11-28T10:34:00.000Z	Amaranth	sanityx	6.10 starts faster but takes longer to show changes you've made
2006-11-28T10:34:00.000Z	sanityx	Amaranth	Ah ok. I get it.
2006-11-28T10:36:00.000Z	sanityx	Amaranth	I can't wait till I get my new laptop tomorrow so I can actually RUN 6.10. Right now I'm running a knoppix 4 hd install off of a PII 333 Mhz /w 512 MB ram
