2010-06-01T03:51:00.000Z	magik		Anyone here any good with conky?
2010-06-01T03:52:00.000Z	Halitech	magik	what is the question you have about conky?
2010-06-01T03:52:00.000Z	magik	Halitech	Just wondering what the code is to show the ip address of your machine.
2010-06-01T03:52:00.000Z	Halitech	magik	give me a second
2010-06-01T03:53:00.000Z	magik	Halitech	Ok, Thanks =]
2010-06-01T03:54:00.000Z	Halitech	magik	here is what I use ${color orange}NETWORK (${addr eth1}) ${hr 2}$color
2010-06-01T03:57:00.000Z	magik	Halitech	That code doesn't work for me. No ip displays =[
2010-06-01T03:57:00.000Z	Halitech	magik	you may need to change eth1 to eth0 or whatever number you use
2010-06-01T03:58:00.000Z	magik	Halitech	That only seems to be getting my internal ip. Is there a way to get my external?
2010-06-01T03:59:00.000Z	Halitech	magik	you didn't mention you had a router :) I think you need a script that can output to a text file but I'm not totally sure how or what to write
2010-06-01T04:01:00.000Z	magik	Halitech	I have seen it in other conky setups...
2010-06-01T04:01:00.000Z	Halitech	magik	so have I but never tried it
2010-06-01T04:01:00.000Z	magik	Halitech	I'll try and get it from another conky script then. Cheers =]
2010-06-01T04:02:00.000Z	Halitech	magik	there might be something here http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=281865
2010-06-01T04:08:00.000Z	magik	Halitech	I could just put my IP in manually.
2010-06-01T04:09:00.000Z	Halitech	magik	that would work but if by chance it changes...
2010-06-01T04:09:00.000Z	magik	Halitech	My ip hasn't changed for about 3 years now. And i can always look it up again.
2010-06-01T04:10:00.000Z	Halitech	magik	okay
2010-06-01T04:14:00.000Z	Halitech	magik	this works, just did it on mine http://forums.opensuse.org/archives/sf-archives/archives-tips-tricks-tweaks/334474-howto-have-conky-displaying-your-internet-ip.html
2010-06-01T04:15:00.000Z	magik	Halitech	I'll do it tommorow. Going to bed in a min. Thanks a lot though =]
2010-06-01T04:15:00.000Z	Halitech	magik	no problem, I wanted the same thing but gave up awhile ago
