2012-03-16T12:36:00.000Z	Jatu		lol
2012-03-16T12:36:00.000Z	Jatu		Jake from london, uk why is your name hackme ?
2012-03-16T12:37:00.000Z	Jatu		Bilegt make sure its not your connection first or your drivers.
2012-03-16T12:37:00.000Z	Jatu		They could be causing the "lag"
2012-03-16T12:38:00.000Z	Jatu		you can go to properties and choose for it to run as an executable
2012-03-16T12:39:00.000Z	bilegt	Jatu	can it any problem with compiz's opengl?
2012-03-16T12:41:00.000Z	bilegt	Jatu	all the time, when it loads a new page
2012-03-16T12:43:00.000Z	bilegt	Jatu	it was all right when it was fresh installed. I deleted ~/.config/chromium and it's working smoothly. But my data are gone :(
2012-03-16T12:44:00.000Z	Jatu	bilegt	: Ah then yeah I have no clue what to tell you. I am also still learning and it seems out of my grasp. If I think of anything I will let you know.
2012-03-16T12:45:00.000Z	bilegt	Jatu	maybe the problem is with the extensions I had installed
2012-03-16T12:46:00.000Z	bilegt	Jatu	Yeah
2012-03-16T12:48:00.000Z	bilegt	Jatu	I'll check that
2012-03-16T12:49:00.000Z	Jatu	bilegt	: will notify when I am back
2012-03-16T12:55:00.000Z	bilegt	Jatu	Yeah, it's weird. Now tabs are moving smoothly.
2012-03-16T12:55:00.000Z	bilegt	Jatu	I've only installed two extensions.
2012-03-16T12:56:00.000Z	bilegt	Jatu	xmarks, gmail and sooner
2012-03-16T12:58:00.000Z	bilegt	Jatu	Now I'll use this method on google chrome again :P
2012-03-16T13:01:00.000Z	bilegt	Jatu	it's such a weird bug. I found it out. It was not about extensions. The problem is with after initial installation of chrome, it asks to setup chrome with google account. It made chrome such a laggy.
2012-03-16T13:02:00.000Z	Jatu	bilegt	: go faster once you set up google account ?
2012-03-16T13:02:00.000Z	bilegt	Jatu	go faster, when I avoided it and installed extensions manually
2012-03-16T13:02:00.000Z	Jatu	bilegt	: atleast you figured it out. Guess problem has been solved none the less lol.
