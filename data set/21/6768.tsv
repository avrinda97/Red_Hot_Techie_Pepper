2007-02-17T13:02:00.000Z	Hellevator	gortba_	if its not installed try "sudo apt-get install build-essential
2007-02-17T13:03:00.000Z	Hellevator	gortba_	to check what version you have you can type "gcc -v"
2007-02-17T13:04:00.000Z	gortba_	Hellevator	this is what I get: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6193/
2007-02-17T13:04:00.000Z	gortba_	Hellevator	Do you know what it means?
2007-02-17T13:04:00.000Z	Hellevator	gortba_	close synaptic and then run the command again
2007-02-17T13:04:00.000Z	gortba_		ahh..
2007-02-17T13:06:00.000Z	gortba_	Hellevator	Thanks. I sudo apt-get install gcc. Do I need to get build-essential too?
2007-02-17T13:07:00.000Z	Hellevator	gortba_	depends. i usually just install build-essential because i'll wind up needing it eventually.  You'll need it if you ever install something from source, but if your just trying to compile your c program installing gcc should be enough.
2007-02-17T13:08:00.000Z	gortba_	Hellevator	I'm trying to compile c++.
2007-02-17T13:10:00.000Z	Hellevator	gortba_	g++ is for compiling c++
2007-02-17T13:11:00.000Z	Hellevator		!build-essential
2007-02-17T13:12:00.000Z	gortba_	Hellevator	So should I sudo apt-get g++?
2007-02-17T13:13:00.000Z	Hellevator	gortba_	you probably already have it but you can type "sudo apt-get install g++" and it will install it if you don't have it
2007-02-17T13:14:00.000Z	gortba_	Hellevator	Thanks. I'm asking all this because I tryed to compile a program using the command g++ and it said no such command was found. I took your advice and installed build essential which solved my problem. Thanks a bunch. You guys are great!
2007-02-17T13:15:00.000Z	Hellevator	gortba_	no problem :) its always great when we can help people
2007-02-17T13:16:00.000Z	gortba_	Hellevator	One last thing. If I have a executable, how do I make it so I can just type the name in the terminal and the program is executed?
2007-02-17T13:16:00.000Z	gortba_	Hellevator	That is without having to navigate to the folder
2007-02-17T13:18:00.000Z	Hellevator	gortba_	you would have to add the directory the file is in to your path.  For now though I think it would just be easier to type ./filename to run it.
2007-02-17T13:19:00.000Z	Hellevator	gortba_	or if its in a different directory you would type ./directorytofile/filename
2007-02-17T13:22:00.000Z	gortba_		Hellavator: Thanks! Catch ya later.
2007-02-17T13:23:00.000Z	Hellevator	gortba_	ill be here if you have any more questions :)
