2009-11-04T21:50:00.000Z	[ZAF]-Coral		Hi
2009-11-04T21:51:00.000Z	[ZAF]-Coral		I chmod 777 / , what do I do or where do I go ?
2009-11-04T21:51:00.000Z	[ZAF]-Coral		lol
2009-11-04T21:51:00.000Z	Pici	[ZAF]-Coral	Reinstall.
2009-11-04T21:51:00.000Z	[ZAF]-Coral		No seriously
2009-11-04T21:51:00.000Z	[ZAF]-Coral		I stopped it half way
2009-11-04T21:51:00.000Z	[ZAF]-Coral		but a lot of stuff is screwed
2009-11-04T21:51:00.000Z	Pici	[ZAF]-Coral	I am being serious. You've completely hosed your permissions.
2009-11-04T21:51:00.000Z	[ZAF]-Coral	Pici	is that really the only way :/
2009-11-04T21:52:00.000Z	[ZAF]-Coral	Pici	I have changed some to higher permissions
2009-11-04T21:52:00.000Z	Pici	[ZAF]-Coral	It would be faster to reinstall then to figure out what the proper permissions for each file are.
2009-11-04T21:53:00.000Z	[ZAF]-Coral	Pici	:/ :(
2009-11-04T21:55:00.000Z	[ZAF]-Coral	Pici	can you reinstall just the file system without formatting the drive ?
2009-11-04T21:55:00.000Z	[ZAF]-Coral		so that I don't have to back my stuff up
2009-11-04T21:56:00.000Z	[ZAF]-Coral		My home drive specifically speaking
2009-11-04T21:56:00.000Z	Pici	[ZAF]-Coral	Is your home on a separate partition?
2009-11-04T21:56:00.000Z	[ZAF]-Coral		nope
2009-11-04T21:58:00.000Z	Pici	[ZAF]-Coral	Then you're taking a gamble if you install over your current install. I know you can tell it not to format the partition,but I'm not sure what it does for the home directory if you specify a user with the same username.
2009-11-04T21:59:00.000Z	[ZAF]-Coral	Pici	well .. I hope then they built ubuntu so that it saves your home if you choose and if you change the user name it will just make another folder
2009-11-04T22:00:00.000Z	[ZAF]-Coral	Pici	If not they should implement such a mechanism
2009-11-04T22:00:00.000Z	Pici	[ZAF]-Coral	I can't say either way, I haven't tried it myself.
