2006-06-04T05:44:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	SurfnKid	whichever, I prefer aptitude, but use what you want (you have choice!)
2006-06-04T05:45:00.000Z	SurfnKid	RandolphCarter	didnt know thanx
2006-06-04T05:54:00.000Z	SurfnKid	RandolphCarter	I installed that how can i get to it now
2006-06-04T05:56:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	SurfnKid	bootsplash?  It should be automagically installed - check that 'ls -l /boot/grub/splash.xpm.gz' shows a result
2006-06-04T05:56:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	SurfnKid	you can change the bootsplash that's going to be used by linking a different splash from /boot/grub/splashimages/ to /boot/grub/splash.xpm.gz
2006-06-04T06:01:00.000Z	SurfnKid	RandolphCarter	xpm.gz isnt there, only folder with splashimages and a bunch xpm.gz's in there
2006-06-04T06:10:00.000Z	SurfnKid	RandolphCarter	whats the file i have to replace evverytime called splash.xpm.gz   copy that to /boot/grub/ then?
2006-06-04T06:10:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	SurfnKid	waa? I didn't say copy
2006-06-04T06:11:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	SurfnKid	link!
2006-06-04T06:11:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	SurfnKid	ie. 'sudo ln -s /boot/grub/splashimages/turtle.xpm.gz /boot/grub/splash.xpm.gz'
2006-06-04T06:16:00.000Z	SurfnKid	RandolphCarter	ok havent done anything yet, glad you told me that
2006-06-04T06:20:00.000Z	SurfnKid	RandolphCarter	if I run the sudo ln even tho there's no splash.xpm.gz file in /boot/grub  it dont matter?
2006-06-04T06:21:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	SurfnKid	yup, it'll create it :)
2006-06-04T06:22:00.000Z	SurfnKid	RandolphCarter	Thats what I wanted to know. :) sorry doin 5 things at once
