2010-11-02T09:50:00.000Z	Silivrenion		Need some help... I have a laptop hooked up to an external monitor. At night, I shut off the external, and close my laptop screen (the residual light annoys me)... apparently ubuntu thinks that it should change my monitor configuration to use one monitor when I do this. How do I get it to not change configurations automatically?
2010-11-02T09:50:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Silivrenion	you should check out your monitors preferences
2010-11-02T09:52:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Silivrenion	you mean when you close the lid of your laptop, it still stays on ?
2010-11-02T09:52:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Silivrenion	you need to check your power management preferences then
2010-11-02T09:53:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Silivrenion	you can make your computer either go on stand-by or hibernate when you close the lid...I am sure you should be able to figure out which suits you best
2010-11-02T09:53:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Silivrenion	hmm
2010-11-02T09:53:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Silivrenion	reading
2010-11-02T09:53:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Silivrenion	do you use nvidia ?
2010-11-02T09:54:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Silivrenion	please check System -> Preferences -> Monitors
2010-11-02T09:55:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Silivrenion	it will be a lot easier if you just open it :)
2010-11-02T09:55:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Silivrenion	are both your monitors connected right now ?
2010-11-02T09:55:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Silivrenion	you should be able to see both the monitors configurations
2010-11-02T09:56:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Silivrenion	ur problem is the fact that the resolution gets changed after you close the lid, am I right ?
2010-11-02T09:58:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Silivrenion	doesn't just using the switch to monitor button do that for you ?
2010-11-02T09:58:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Silivrenion	or are you trying to use both the monitors at the same time ?
2010-11-02T09:59:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Silivrenion	I use nvidia so its a little difficult for me to explain, but x display configuration allows me to control the way I want to use multiple monitors
2010-11-02T09:59:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Silivrenion	can you show me a screen shot of your monitor prefs ?

2010-11-02T10:07:00.000Z	Silivrenion	dhruvasagar	I found that xset dpms force off is a workaround that will turn off the monitors nicely
2010-11-02T10:07:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Silivrenion	hmm
