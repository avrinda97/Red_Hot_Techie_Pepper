2010-10-12T16:08:00.000Z	ovrflw0x		i've installed xubuntu-desktop on ubuntu how to remove gnome nicely? 10.10 here
2010-10-12T16:09:00.000Z	glebihan	ovrflw0x	remove "ubuntu-desktop" then run "sudo apt-get autoremove"
2010-10-12T16:12:00.000Z	ovrflw0x	glebihan	i still see gnome-power-applet running
2010-10-12T16:14:00.000Z	glebihan	ovrflw0x	xfce uses some gnome components, if you really want to get rid of all of them, run "sudo apt-get remove gnome-*", and "sudo apt-get autoremove" again
2010-10-12T16:15:00.000Z	ovrflw0x	glebihan	i have two power managers xfce and gnome how can i uninstall gnome one?
2010-10-12T16:16:00.000Z	glebihan	ovrflw0x	the gnome one is called gnome-power-manager, you can remove this package
2010-10-12T16:16:00.000Z	ovrflw0x	glebihan	both power managers are running i don't want that to happen with other programs too what to do?
2010-10-12T16:17:00.000Z	glebihan	ovrflw0x	as I said, if you want to remove all gnome components, "sudo apt-get remove gnome-*"
2010-10-12T16:17:00.000Z	ovrflw0x	glebihan	should i also add in && install xubuntu-desktop?
2010-10-12T16:19:00.000Z	ovrflw0x	glebihan	?
2010-10-12T16:19:00.000Z	glebihan	ovrflw0x	you already installed it, right ? if so, no
2010-10-12T16:19:00.000Z	ovrflw0x	glebihan	you told me xfce uses some gnome packages
2010-10-12T16:20:00.000Z	glebihan	ovrflw0x	well it *can* use some gnome components : they appear in recommended packages, but not in dependencies
2010-10-12T16:23:00.000Z	ovrflw0x	glebihan	when i do remove gnome-* it tells me new packages of KDE will be installed! why?
2010-10-12T16:25:00.000Z	glebihan	ovrflw0x	probably because some installed packages depend on either a package from gnome or one from kde; as you're forcing to uninstall gnome packages, it will install the depency from kde
2010-10-12T16:25:00.000Z	ovrflw0x	glebihan	which one would be better?
2010-10-12T16:25:00.000Z	ovrflw0x		dependency from kde or gnome?
2010-10-12T16:26:00.000Z	glebihan	ovrflw0x	either one should work just as fine
2010-10-12T16:26:00.000Z	ovrflw0x	glebihan	is there command which leaves the dependecy alone and only remove 'extra' gnome stuff?
2010-10-12T16:30:00.000Z	glebihan	ovrflw0x	I can't find such an option
