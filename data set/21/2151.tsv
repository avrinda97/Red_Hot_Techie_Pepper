2011-10-22T22:25:00.000Z	kurisu		hey guys, looking for some virtualbox advice... basically have a smb client on the host that the client connects to... sometimes/sometimes not... I think it has eomthing to do with my wifi connection as it only happens when I'm in my bedroom... does anyone have any suggestions as to how I can resolve this issue?
2011-10-22T22:27:00.000Z	kurisu		basically I windows doesnt always connect to ubuntu's smb share
2011-10-22T22:27:00.000Z	kurisu		ryty.... very good question, I should have thouhgt of that
2011-10-22T22:28:00.000Z	kurisu		I'll try now (if it doesn't work)
2011-10-22T22:28:00.000Z	meowsus	kurisu	hmmm... you've installed and adjusted samba with system-config-samba?
2011-10-22T22:29:00.000Z	kurisu	meowsus	adjusted smb??? I just edited the smb.conf as required
2011-10-22T22:29:00.000Z	meowsus	kurisu	ah, right on. I use the "system-samba-config" package to edit smb.conf usually. it's just easier and quicker for me.
2011-10-22T22:30:00.000Z	kurisu		oh right... didn't even realise it existed
2011-10-22T22:31:00.000Z	meowsus	kurisu	its a good way to see if what you've done in smb.conf is viable. For really basic networking (like on my network ;) it works for me every time.
2011-10-22T22:31:00.000Z	meowsus		I too do the VirtualBox-to-Ubuntu using SMB configuration
2011-10-22T22:31:00.000Z	meowsus		Keep in mind Windows uses Domain prefixes before their usernames, now with Win7. So your windows user name is actually 'DOMAIN\username' not just 'username'
2011-10-22T22:32:00.000Z	kurisu		oh right... well it shares file to my media centre so I presumed all was ok
2011-10-22T22:32:00.000Z	kurisu		is there a way to set up vb so that smb doesn't need a network connection
2011-10-22T22:33:00.000Z	kurisu		*** a real (external) network connection
2011-10-22T22:33:00.000Z	meowsus	kurisu	you know? I've never thought of that...
2011-10-22T22:33:00.000Z	kurisu		hmm
2011-10-22T22:34:00.000Z	kurisu		just thought that would be the best way, since I don't always get a connection in Uni
2011-10-22T22:34:00.000Z	meowsus	kurisu	maybe something in here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VirtualBox/Networking
2011-10-22T22:34:00.000Z	kurisu		thanks
2011-10-22T22:36:00.000Z	kurisu		just thought it would be the best way as I don't always get a connection when i'm in uni and I think thats whats causing me intermittant issues with my share when I'm at home
2011-10-22T22:45:00.000Z	kurisu	meowsus	ah ha... you can just use te shared folders in vb to share without an external connection
