2010-09-17T08:55:00.000Z	xbonesx		Hi, I recenetly installed ubuntu 9.04 and selected it to be installed on a second partition. I then decided that I didn't want it on its own partition and rather installed inside my current os(win7). Now i get a grub 22 error on boot, and can't access win7. I tried to run the dvd for win7 using the recovery tools but it tells me that i don't have an OS isntalled. Can anyone assist me with this please? Thanks in advance.

2010-09-17T08:58:00.000Z	xbonesx	at05gt	Ubuntu has an option to be installed within windows and its given a boot option on startup.
2010-09-17T08:58:00.000Z	at05gt	xbonesx	its still not wise to install 2 OS on the SAME partition
2010-09-17T09:00:00.000Z	at05gt	xbonesx	your most likely going to have to repair or reinstall both OS, on separate partitions
2010-09-17T09:00:00.000Z	xbonesx	at05gt	Win7 is still active and i can access it if i boot hirens bootcd
2010-09-17T09:01:00.000Z	at05gt	xbonesx	ya i dont know about win 7, what does it do when you try to boot win 7? and what os are you inside right now?
