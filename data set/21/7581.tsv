2006-10-13T09:45:00.000Z	screechingcat		does removing openoffice break a lot of thing in dapper ?
2006-10-13T09:46:00.000Z	sproingie	screechingcat	doesnt break anything
2006-10-13T09:46:00.000Z	screechingcat	sproingie	really ? even though it is so tightly integrated ?
2006-10-13T09:46:00.000Z	sproingie	screechingcat	it's not really integrated with anything
2006-10-13T09:47:00.000Z	screechingcat		coz im planning to install gnome-office and remove openoffice
2006-10-13T09:47:00.000Z	screechingcat		good choice ?
2006-10-13T09:47:00.000Z	sproingie		not really
2006-10-13T09:47:00.000Z	sproingie		gnumeric's a good spreadsheet.  everything else sucks.
2006-10-13T09:47:00.000Z	sproingie		was one of the first gnome apps too
2006-10-13T09:47:00.000Z	sproingie		it's aged pretty well
2006-10-13T09:48:00.000Z	screechingcat		i dont use the office suites that much. but whenever i do its just for reading a few docs and spreadsheets and openoffice is VERY slow for that
2006-10-13T09:48:00.000Z	sproingie		openoffice is slow all right, but it's got the function
2006-10-13T09:48:00.000Z	sproingie		if you just want a light wp, try abiword
2006-10-13T09:49:00.000Z	sproingie		which is of course the WP for gnome-office ... heh
2006-10-13T09:49:00.000Z	screechingcat	sproingie	i already have abiword. thats what gave me the idea to get the rest of the suite
2006-10-13T09:49:00.000Z	sproingie	screechingcat	well abiword really isn't even all that great, it's more like wordpad than word
2006-10-13T09:50:00.000Z	screechingcat	sproingie	ah well ok. abiword stays then
2006-10-13T09:50:00.000Z	screechingcat	sproingie	my mistake. that was openoffice stays then
2006-10-13T09:51:00.000Z	sproingie	screechingcat	if you need to open office docs, you probably want to keep openoffice
2006-10-13T09:51:00.000Z	screechingcat	sproingie	i tested that. abiword opens docs pretty well
2006-10-13T09:52:00.000Z	screechingcat	sproingie	i have oo.o on windows too
