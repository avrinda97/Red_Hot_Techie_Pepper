2011-04-21T17:25:00.000Z	LetsGo67	terry	Mac, not MAC.
2011-04-21T17:25:00.000Z	terry	LetsGo67	Thanks. I stand corrected. (Mac is not an acronym :)
2011-04-25T17:55:00.000Z	terry	LetsGo67	Try firefox
2011-04-25T17:56:00.000Z	LetsGo67	terry	Fx4 says "connection not certified".  It is begging me to "get me out of here!"
2011-04-25T17:57:00.000Z	terry	LetsGo67	accept the cert
2011-04-25T17:57:00.000Z	LetsGo67	terry	Why does it say that?
2011-04-25T17:58:00.000Z	LetsGo67	terry	Typing www.Bell.ca fixes it.
2011-04-25T17:58:00.000Z	terry	LetsGo67	for your edification
2011-04-25T17:58:00.000Z	LetsGo67	terry	but not in Opera.  How is that supposed to edify me?
2011-04-25T17:59:00.000Z	terry	LetsGo67	By reading the information, understanding it etc.
2011-04-25T17:59:00.000Z	LetsGo67	terry	Does that mean Bell is not secure, Bell's certificate is expired, etc.?
2011-04-25T18:00:00.000Z	terry	LetsGo67	Is the time correct on your PC?
2011-04-25T18:00:00.000Z	LetsGo67	terry	It's NTP synced.
2011-04-25T18:00:00.000Z	terry	LetsGo67	Time and date... are they correct?
2011-04-25T18:01:00.000Z	LetsGo67	terry	Yes, they are synced with Ubuntu.
2011-04-25T18:01:00.000Z	LetsGo67	terry	they should be, at least.
2011-04-25T18:02:00.000Z	terry	LetsGo67	Then you are good to go.  If the cert is ok accept it.
2011-04-25T18:04:00.000Z	LetsGo67	terry	Why does www.Bell.ca work but not Bell.ca in Firefox?
2011-04-25T18:05:00.000Z	terry	LetsGo67	Not sure, firefox usually will add www when needed.  Mine does.
2011-04-25T18:08:00.000Z	terry	LetsGo67	What country are you in?
2011-04-25T18:11:00.000Z	terry	LetsGo67	So, you may see a different behavour than some of the rest of us, (as in me, from different isp and different country).
