2012-08-05T03:33:00.000Z	theforgewright		Hello! Having an issue installing Ubuntu on a laptop with a broken monitor. I can't get it to swap to the external.
2012-08-05T03:33:00.000Z	theforgewright		The install itself went well, but now booting it up it seems it's defaulted to the laptop monitor and is ignoring the HDMI one
2012-08-05T03:34:00.000Z	theforgewright		FN+f4 does nothing, it seems
2012-08-05T03:34:00.000Z	theforgewright		That's the display changer on this laptop
2012-08-05T03:35:00.000Z	theforgewright		It's fubar, backlight's dead. I can kinda make out shapes with the aid of a flashlight, but I can't see the mouse or anything detailed.
2012-08-05T03:35:00.000Z	tomreyn	theforgewright	chances are it doesn't activate the external monitor by default but you need to do it manually (using software and configurations)
2012-08-05T03:36:00.000Z	tomreyn	theforgewright	are you into the linux shell, i.e. working with a temrinal?
2012-08-05T03:37:00.000Z	tomreyn	theforgewright	do you know which video card you have ther eon this laptop?
2012-08-05T03:37:00.000Z	tomreyn	theforgewright	okay, xrandr would be my plan, too
2012-08-05T03:38:00.000Z	tomreyn	theforgewright	do you have an integrated grpahics chipset, too?
2012-08-05T03:40:00.000Z	tomreyn	theforgewright	are you using the nouveau (open source) or (proprietary) nvidia drivers?
2012-08-05T03:41:00.000Z	tomreyn	theforgewright	and which "initial install configuration screen" are you referring to?
2012-08-05T03:42:00.000Z	tomreyn	theforgewright	okay, sorry i didn't think much there ;-)
2012-08-05T03:42:00.000Z	tomreyn	theforgewright	how did you install in the first place then?
2012-08-05T03:44:00.000Z	tomreyn	theforgewright	does it output to both screens during boot?
2012-08-05T03:45:00.000Z	tomreyn	theforgewright	i'd say reinstall using the alternative installer, and make sure you install an ssh server on it in the end, and test that you can connect to it fine.
2012-08-05T03:47:00.000Z	tomreyn	theforgewright	tat'd be my suggestion. so you can change configuration back and forth easily and can always see what's going on.
2012-08-05T03:47:00.000Z	tomreyn	theforgewright	otherwise it'll just be annoying.
2012-08-05T03:49:00.000Z	tomreyn	theforgewright	so when the alternative installer is done and wants to reboot, cacel and get back to that main menu where all the installation steps are listed. on the very bottom you should see an option to run a shell.
2012-08-05T03:50:00.000Z	tomreyn	theforgewright	i think it also provides instrcutions on how to access the location where it has installed ubuntu to. you will probably have to chroot to that and install the openssh package there manually
2012-08-05T03:50:00.000Z	tomreyn	theforgewright	openssh-server, that is.
