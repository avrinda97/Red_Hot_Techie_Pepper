2010-10-10T02:56:00.000Z	wendico		unshare your c drive on the shared tab option, then reestart and it will be automaticly be shared as c$
2010-10-10T02:57:00.000Z	wendico		if your user is a member of the computer administrators group, it will let you read and write by default
2010-10-10T02:58:00.000Z	wendico		no you dont need to share anything since the full hard drive is automaticly shared full control to computer administrators with the $ symbol
2010-10-10T03:00:00.000Z	wendico		tongas, thats (c$) is another reason why windows is so secure xddddddddddddd

2010-10-10T03:05:00.000Z	wendico		My probles is that my UNEXPANDED panel comes into the center of the screen instead of aligned to top or botton when i log in or reset panels, any help?
2010-10-10T03:06:00.000Z	ArtArfon	wendico	Drag the panel to where you want it
2010-10-10T03:08:00.000Z	ArtArfon	wendico	Doesnt it save to position of the panel ? /Then you have other issues.
2010-10-10T03:09:00.000Z	wendico	ArtArfon	it looks that it is saved the position so the right position is cheched on the panel properties but anyways if the EXPAND option is not checked the panel cames always in the middle of the screen
2010-10-10T03:10:00.000Z	ArtArfon	wendico	Aha, it should take the Shrunken panel and calcualte the left vs the right sizes and place it in the center of those values.
2010-10-10T03:11:00.000Z	ArtArfon	wendico	Aha, it should take the Shrunken panel and calculate the left vs the right sizes and place it in the center of those values. I can see how a a miscalc could happen there.
2010-10-10T03:11:00.000Z	ArtArfon	wendico	Bugreport it.
2010-10-10T03:12:00.000Z	ArtArfon	wendico	google "ubuntu bug" i guess
