2007-04-27T11:36:00.000Z	Nubbie	deafboy	is it a 3d application?
2007-04-27T11:36:00.000Z	Nubbie	deafboy	do you have your drivers set up for 3d?
2007-04-27T11:37:00.000Z	deafboy	Nubbie	yes i do, fglrx
2007-04-27T11:37:00.000Z	Nubbie	deafboy	fglrx doesn't do DRI, which may be why you're locking up.
2007-04-27T11:37:00.000Z	deafboy	Nubbie	it doesnt do composite w/ dri
2007-04-27T11:37:00.000Z	deafboy	Nubbie	it does DRI
2007-04-27T11:38:00.000Z	deafboy	Nubbie	i have 3d acceleration
2007-04-27T11:41:00.000Z	deafboy	Nubbie	wine hq claims its my drivers as no app should be able to hardlock my computer.....
2007-04-27T11:41:00.000Z	Nubbie	deafboy	the wine guys are weird... their software is just as prone to lock your computer as any other software.
2007-04-27T11:43:00.000Z	deafboy	Nubbie	i just thought it was a driver issue because APPDb says it works flawlessly in feisty
2007-04-27T11:43:00.000Z	Nubbie	deafboy	what are you trying to run in wine first of all?
2007-04-27T11:44:00.000Z	deafboy	Nubbie	WoW, has worked many times pre-feisty
2007-04-27T11:54:00.000Z	deafboy	Nubbie	know anyone running fglrx drivers having issues, i heard the newest kernel has issues with fglrx
2007-04-27T11:55:00.000Z	Nubbie	deafboy	i don't know, i stopped using fglrx once the radeon drivers were improved.
2007-04-27T11:56:00.000Z	deafboy	Nubbie	do they support the x1000 series yet
2007-04-27T11:56:00.000Z	Nubbie	deafboy	if you're relatively sure it's not a wine problem, it most likely has something to do with your vid card.
2007-04-27T11:56:00.000Z	deafboy	Nubbie	used to work fine in edgy XD
2007-04-27T11:56:00.000Z	Nubbie	deafboy	i dunno i use radeon 9550
2007-04-27T11:57:00.000Z	deafboy	Nubbie	yep my card is too new /cry
