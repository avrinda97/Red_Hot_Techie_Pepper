2006-03-20T14:34:00.000Z	mouldy		hey all, I'm trying to set up my hp2600 printer through  the network. When I go to the Add a printer thing it asks for a host and a port (default 9100) what on earth do I put in the host?
2006-03-20T14:35:00.000Z	oskude	mouldy	the IP of your network printer
2006-03-20T14:36:00.000Z	mouldy	oskude	How do I find the IP address?
2006-03-20T14:37:00.000Z	oskude	mouldy	where does your printer get its ip, dhcp or is static ?
2006-03-20T14:37:00.000Z	mouldy	oskude	DHCP I think (not entirely sure)
2006-03-20T14:37:00.000Z	oskude	mouldy	so you propably have it in your router that has dhcp ?
2006-03-20T14:37:00.000Z	mouldy	oskude	ok, now to remember the IP address and username and password of my router :\
2006-03-20T14:38:00.000Z	oskude	mouldy	you could try the comman nmap
2006-03-20T14:38:00.000Z	oskude	mouldy	to find out what services are running in your network
2006-03-20T14:38:00.000Z	mouldy	oskude	A what? :p
2006-03-20T14:38:00.000Z	oskude	mouldy	sudo apt-get install nmap
2006-03-20T14:39:00.000Z	mouldy	oskude	now what do I do with it?
2006-03-20T14:41:00.000Z	oskude	mouldy	and it should show one ip with port 9100 (if printer is on the same network)
2006-03-20T14:42:00.000Z	oskude	mouldy	hmm
2006-03-20T14:43:00.000Z	oskude	mouldy	did you find your computer an the router ?
2006-03-20T14:43:00.000Z	oskude	mouldy	didnt you have the printer on as you did the printer wizard ? i think it should find it automaticly
2006-03-20T14:44:00.000Z	mouldy	oskude	naa, it didnt find it. It was on earlier but the damn thing turns itself off if you dont use it for 10 minutes or somehting
2006-03-20T14:44:00.000Z	oskude	mouldy	:)
2006-03-20T15:06:00.000Z	oskude	mouldy	nice
