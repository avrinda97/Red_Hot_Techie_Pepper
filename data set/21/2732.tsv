2009-07-08T13:55:00.000Z	Guest48544	bullgard4	:S, i really can't tell how that has anything to do with a wacom tablet
2009-07-08T13:58:00.000Z	bullgard4	Guest48544	You have got a terrible nickname. I mixed it with Guest7355.

2009-07-08T14:00:00.000Z	bullgard4	Guest48544	I have put here 2 questions. 1 has been answered. --  I do not know your problem.
2009-07-08T14:01:00.000Z	Guest48544	bullgard4	will u be here tomorrow because im dead tired and there's no point to me in trying to learn this late
2009-07-08T14:01:00.000Z	bullgard4	Guest48544	Probably yes.
2009-07-08T14:02:00.000Z	Guest48544	bullgard4	not that im expecting you to promise anything but what time is it where you live and when do you think would be on tomorrow?
2009-07-08T14:04:00.000Z	bullgard4	Guest48544	It is 11:03 local time here. Problably starting at 06:00 local time.
2009-07-08T14:05:00.000Z	Guest48544	bullgard4	both times are in pm?
2009-07-08T14:06:00.000Z	bullgard4	Guest48544	No both times are AM (or 24 h scale, for that matter.) local time = GMT + 2 at the moment.
2009-07-08T14:07:00.000Z	Guest48544	bullgard4	all right, thanks, ill see you tomorrow hopefully
2009-07-09T08:44:00.000Z	Guest48544	bullgard4	hi, im the guy you spoke to yesterday about the wacom device; could you help me configure it (it already works just not the right way)
2009-07-09T08:47:00.000Z	bullgard4	Guest48544	Good morning. --  I am afraid I cannot help you much. I have never used any Wacom device and never configured one.
2009-07-09T08:48:00.000Z	Guest48544	bullgard4	:( k, thanks anyways, im just so desperate because nobody in 3 forums is answering or in irc channels
2009-07-09T08:49:00.000Z	bullgard4	Guest48544	I know this desperate feeling. It helps best that you put the question repeatedly in not too short intervals.
2009-07-09T08:53:00.000Z	Guest48544	bullgard4	lol, k thanks, i might just do that :D
2009-07-09T08:53:00.000Z	bullgard4	Guest48544	I wish you good luck.
2009-07-09T08:53:00.000Z	Guest48544	bullgard4	thanks
