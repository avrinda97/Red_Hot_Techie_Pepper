2008-08-20T01:42:00.000Z	squiddy		need help with installing intel wireless driver, here ?
2008-08-20T01:42:00.000Z	teeu334	squiddy	intel wireless drivers are part of the mainline kernel since 8.04. you don't install them.
2008-08-20T01:43:00.000Z	squiddy	teeu334	but, there is no option for wireless network on network manager ?
2008-08-20T01:43:00.000Z	teeu334	squiddy	and you are sure your wireless chipset is intel?
2008-08-20T01:44:00.000Z	squiddy	teeu334	yes. it's my friend laptop, when i lshw -C network, it says intel pro wireless
2008-08-20T01:45:00.000Z	teeu334	squiddy	which one exactly?
2008-08-20T01:46:00.000Z	squiddy	teeu334	i can't remember, laptop is on another place. but only i can remember, it was like intel PRO BG wireless
2008-08-20T01:46:00.000Z	teeu334	squiddy	and which ubuntu version?
2008-08-20T01:46:00.000Z	squiddy	teeu334	ubuntu 8.04
2008-08-20T01:47:00.000Z	squiddy	teeu334	oops sorry, ubuntu 8.04.1
2008-08-20T01:47:00.000Z	teeu334	squiddy	then you already have intel wireless drivers installed. i guess it is just a hardware rf kill switch, disabling the antenna.
2008-08-20T01:48:00.000Z	teeu334	squiddy	further debugging is not possible without testing some commands on the notebook
2008-08-20T01:48:00.000Z	squiddy	teeu334	how could i re-enable the device, please ? fn key's not working
2008-08-20T01:48:00.000Z	teeu334	squiddy	i don't know. this is highly notebook specific.
2008-08-20T01:49:00.000Z	squiddy	teeu334	ok, i guess i'll come back when i have the laptop.. thanks anyway
2008-08-20T01:49:00.000Z	teeu334	squiddy	good notebooks have a hardware switch for that, not needing any software support for it.
2008-08-20T01:50:00.000Z	teeu334	squiddy	in cheap notebooks the rf kill switch just produces a ACPI hotkey event which must be handled by the OS
2008-08-20T01:51:00.000Z	squiddy	teeu334	i guess so, i'll ask my friend wether his laptop has any switch for that or not,,, i'm not really familiar with toshiba laptops
2008-08-20T01:51:00.000Z	teeu334	squiddy	me neither. i use thinkpads.
2008-08-20T01:51:00.000Z	squiddy	teeu334	ok thanks. c ya :)
