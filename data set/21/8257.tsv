2007-02-11T09:50:00.000Z	ShiftyPowers		guys, how do I force a restart of apache2?
2007-02-11T09:50:00.000Z	ShiftyPowers		it's gone all crazy on me
2007-02-11T09:50:00.000Z	ikonia	ShiftyPowers	sudo /etc/init.d/apache restart
2007-02-11T09:50:00.000Z	ShiftyPowers	ikonia	that's what I ran but I get this http://www.pastebin.ca/350590
2007-02-11T09:51:00.000Z	ikonia	ShiftyPowers	you've not configured apache - its using localhost for a hostname (127.0.0.1)
2007-02-11T09:52:00.000Z	ShiftyPowers	ikonia	what do you mean?
2007-02-11T09:52:00.000Z	ikonia	ShiftyPowers	I mean you've not configured apache - the servername directive has not been set so its using 127.0.0.1
2007-02-11T09:52:00.000Z	ikonia	ShiftyPowers	read up on apache
2007-11-30T02:43:00.000Z	ikonia	ShiftyPowers	depends on why is corrupted
2007-11-30T02:44:00.000Z	ikonia	ShiftyPowers	then put a new file system on it
2007-11-30T02:44:00.000Z	ShiftyPowers	ikonia	can i do that via ubuntu?
2007-11-30T02:44:00.000Z	ShiftyPowers	ikonia	i imagine it's useing newfs right?
2007-11-30T02:44:00.000Z	ikonia	ShiftyPowers	shure, what file system do you want on it
2007-11-30T02:44:00.000Z	ikonia	ShiftyPowers	nah, mke2fs for ext2 mke2fs -j for ext3 etc etc
2007-11-30T02:45:00.000Z	ShiftyPowers	ikonia	cool thanks
2008-01-22T03:36:00.000Z	ikonia	ShiftyPowers	edid is monitor issues, not nvidia issues normally
2008-01-22T03:36:00.000Z	ikonia	ShiftyPowers	a lot of kit announces rubbish edid info
2008-01-22T03:36:00.000Z	ShiftyPowers	ikonia	i get that error about EDID being invalid, i'm trying desperately to solve it
2008-01-22T03:37:00.000Z	ikonia	ShiftyPowers	you'll porbably have to set the info manually if edid info is rubbish
2008-01-22T03:37:00.000Z	ShiftyPowers	ikonia	any docs on how to do that?
2008-01-22T03:37:00.000Z	ikonia	ShiftyPowers	you'll have to set info like hsncy and vsync and 1280x800 say in xorg.conf manually, or use "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" and enter the info manually
