2011-11-09T21:15:00.000Z	bjrohan		Can anyone help me with changing permissions on a USB drive?
2011-11-09T21:16:00.000Z	CJKay	bjrohan	Change the permissions of the on accessing the drive or the files on it?
2011-11-09T21:16:00.000Z	bjrohan	CJKay	both. I have a USB drive attached to a desktop I wish to be able to access via SAMBA on my laptop
2011-11-09T21:17:00.000Z	CJKay	bjrohan	What filesystem is the USB drive?
2011-11-09T21:18:00.000Z	bjrohan	CJKay	NTFS
2011-11-09T21:19:00.000Z	CJKay	bjrohan	In that case I'm not sure. Try doing a search for NTFS-3G permission management
2011-11-09T21:20:00.000Z	bjrohan	CJKay	the files system of the USB drive is NTFS. The/media directory has rwxrwxrwx for its permissions
2011-11-09T21:21:00.000Z	CJKay	bjrohan	What is it you are prevented from doing?
2011-11-09T21:23:00.000Z	bjrohan	CJKay	I am prevented from changing the permission of the USB drive. I have done sudo chmod 777 BACKUP, and the permissions for the BACKUP usb drive are still RWX------
2011-11-09T21:24:00.000Z	CJKay	bjrohan	Try `sudo chown <username> BACKUP && sudo chmod -r 777 *`
2011-11-09T21:29:00.000Z	CJKay	bjrohan	Woops heh. `cd /media && sudo chown -R <username> BACKUP && sudo chmod -R 777  BACKUP`
2011-11-09T21:29:00.000Z	CJKay	bjrohan	Then check permissions
2011-11-09T21:33:00.000Z	CJKay	bjrohan	Well what I gave you should have chown'd every file and directory on the stick to your name and then chmod'd each file to 777 to make sure
2011-11-09T21:33:00.000Z	CJKay	bjrohan	So depending on how much is on there... heh
2011-11-09T21:36:00.000Z	bjrohan	CJKay	it is a 500 GB HD :-)
2011-11-09T21:36:00.000Z	CJKay	bjrohan	Well then you could definitely be waiting some time :P
2011-11-09T21:36:00.000Z	bjrohan	CJKay	it is finished, I did a ls -l and the permissions are still rwx------ :-( it shows me as the owner instead of root however
2011-11-09T21:36:00.000Z	CJKay	bjrohan	Lol wtf
2011-11-09T21:37:00.000Z	CJKay	bjrohan	Definitely an NTFS permissions problem then, you'll have to do a search for how NTFS-3G handles users and permissions
2011-11-09T21:37:00.000Z	bjrohan	CJKay	okey dokey. Thanks for your help!
2011-11-09T21:38:00.000Z	bjrohan	CJKay	I do greatly appreciate it, at least I have a dierction to go in
