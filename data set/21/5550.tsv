2008-02-29T11:16:00.000Z	DrBanzai		Ok, I have slow program launches.  For instance, when I click Applications at the top, it works fine, then I point to Accessories then I click on Terminal.  I get a "Starting Terminal" box, on my "task bar", for 17 seconds...then that goes away, and I have nothing for another 12 seconds, then the terminal finally pops up...any ideas?
2008-02-29T11:16:00.000Z	bazhang	DrBanzai	how much ram
2008-02-29T11:16:00.000Z	DrBanzai	bazhang	2 gig
2008-02-29T11:17:00.000Z	bazhang	DrBanzai	are you running compiz, awn or other cpu consuming widgets?
2008-02-29T11:18:00.000Z	DrBanzai	bazhang	Hmmm, I'm really sure.  It's a stock install of Gutsy for the AMD64...
2008-02-29T11:18:00.000Z	DrBanzai	bazhang	But I do seem to recall turning on compiz
2008-02-29T11:19:00.000Z	bazhang	DrBanzai	can you open up a terminal and type top to see what is eating processes
2008-02-29T11:21:00.000Z	DrBanzai	bazhang	Load Average: 0.51 0.39 0.24  pidgin is using 4%...that's the highest
2008-02-29T11:22:00.000Z	bazhang	DrBanzai	that is odd; if you turn off compiz what are the results-- alt-f2 metacity --replace
2008-02-29T11:25:00.000Z	DrBanzai	bazhang	It's a little bit faster...8 seconds of "Starting Terminal" Then 4 seconds of nothing
2008-02-29T11:25:00.000Z	bazhang	DrBanzai	what video card and what driver for getting compiz more in sync--its good that it is faster but still waaaay too slow
2008-02-29T11:26:00.000Z	DrBanzai	bazhang	GeForce 7300 GS 256MB PCI-E 16x, and how do I check the driver?
2008-02-29T11:28:00.000Z	bazhang	DrBanzai	that is the exact same card I have and a slew of recent updates ruined my video, had to reinstall the drivers--are you able to view video no problem?
2008-02-29T11:28:00.000Z	DrBanzai	bazhang	BTW, everything works perfectly fine once launched.
2008-02-29T11:29:00.000Z	bazhang	DrBanzai	then there is a serious memory leak--and youtube not working has been fixed you just need to reinstall the flash plug in nonfree
2008-02-29T11:30:00.000Z	DrBanzai	bazhang	Oh wonderful...
2008-02-29T11:51:00.000Z	DrBanzai	bazhang	So how do I turn compiz back on?
2008-02-29T11:51:00.000Z	bazhang	DrBanzai	alt f2 compiz --replace
2008-02-29T11:52:00.000Z	DrBanzai	bazhang	Thanks
2008-02-29T11:52:00.000Z	bazhang	DrBanzai	no worries ;]
2008-05-22T06:40:00.000Z	bazhang	DrBanzai	which question you want answered first?
