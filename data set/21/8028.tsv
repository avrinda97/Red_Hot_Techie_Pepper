2007-05-25T16:12:00.000Z	technel		Does anyone know how to get vim colorschemes to work with gnome-terminal? They were in gvim, but not with the "vim" command. I tried "export TERM="xterm-color"" already.
2007-05-25T16:12:00.000Z	technel		I mean they *work* in gvim
2007-05-25T05:52:00.000Z	technel		What's the difference between mysql-client and mysql-server?
2007-05-25T05:53:00.000Z	bruenig	technel	do apt-cache show mysql-client | grep Depends (and then do the same for server, if they have the same dependencies then they are likely meta packages that install the same thing)
2007-06-27T16:28:00.000Z	bruenig	technel	use sudo and modify it from cli
2007-06-27T16:28:00.000Z	technel	bruenig	Well I did umount it and chown to "michael", but it just goes back after restart...
2007-06-27T16:30:00.000Z	bruenig	technel	mount it the real way with /etc/fstab
2007-06-27T16:31:00.000Z	technel	bruenig	I have an entry in fstab and I looked at the ubuntu wiki, but I couldn't find anything about permissions for mounting... (note: diskmounter just adds it to fstab and it's done)
2007-06-27T16:31:00.000Z	technel	bruenig	How do I change the mount permissions?
2007-06-27T16:31:00.000Z	bruenig	technel	what is the filesystem
2007-06-27T16:31:00.000Z	technel	bruenig	vfat
2007-06-27T16:32:00.000Z	bruenig	technel	add the following options, fmask=111,dmask=000
2007-06-27T16:33:00.000Z	technel	bruenig	Ok, restarting, one second...
2007-06-27T16:37:00.000Z	technel	bruenig	Thanks
2007-07-05T13:48:00.000Z	bruenig	technel	how can I program crash after you try to start it
2007-07-05T13:48:00.000Z	bruenig	technel	does not try imply that you don't
2007-07-05T13:48:00.000Z	technel	bruenig	The process successfully loads, then reads the config, then fails/crashes
2007-07-05T13:51:00.000Z	technel	bruenig	"how can I program crash" :) Any idea how to fix the problem?
2007-07-05T13:53:00.000Z	bruenig	technel	there is a difference between a typo and a statement that is confusingly ambiguous
2007-07-05T13:53:00.000Z	technel	bruenig	Please allow me to rephrase.
2007-07-08T09:15:00.000Z	bruenig	technel	depends if it shows up or not when you hit it, sometimes keys don't
