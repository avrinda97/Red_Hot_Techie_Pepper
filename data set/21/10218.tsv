2005-04-21T07:33:00.000Z	penguin42	bob2	Ah cool - I've used that to get me out of holes on machines with Debian where the kernel wouldn't boot it
2005-04-21T07:39:00.000Z	penguin42	bob2	Wrong, /usr/bin/edit
2005-04-21T07:40:00.000Z	bob2	penguin42	"when I write edit, I mean it as a verb, not a program"
2005-04-21T07:40:00.000Z	penguin42	bob2	Ah....
2005-04-21T10:19:00.000Z	bob2	penguin42	apt-file, same as in Debian
2005-04-21T10:19:00.000Z	bob2	penguin42	apt-cache can never find files in packages
2005-04-21T10:19:00.000Z	penguin42	bob2	Oh - never used that on debian! I always used the dpkg bot on #debian and the package web pages
2005-04-21T10:20:00.000Z	bob2	penguin42	someone made a contents search thing, it's linked from the front of the wiki
2005-04-21T10:20:00.000Z	penguin42	bob2	Damn - it doesn't find my file
2005-04-21T10:22:00.000Z	penguin42	bob2	Ta - ah, I hadn't grok'd that apt-file has a seperate database and needed an update first
2005-04-21T10:51:00.000Z	penguin42	bob2	I think there are a lot of people jumping from (standard) debian
2005-04-21T10:51:00.000Z	bob2	penguin42	yeah
2005-04-21T10:55:00.000Z	penguin42	bob2	There are some small things - e.g. the graphical login text is very small on 1600x1200 and I can't see any obvious way to change it
2005-04-21T10:55:00.000Z	bob2	penguin42	the font size should be set in points, ie be physically the same size on any screen
2005-04-21T10:56:00.000Z	penguin42	bob2	Indeed - although auto detecting DPI is pretty random
2005-04-21T10:56:00.000Z	bob2	penguin42	sure, the dpi probably requires a question
2005-04-21T10:57:00.000Z	penguin42	bob2	Hehe - what we need is a dialog with a picture of known coins on them and asking how large they are :-)
2005-04-21T10:57:00.000Z	bob2	penguin42	haha
2005-04-21T10:59:00.000Z	penguin42	bob2	Is it realmedia ?
2005-04-21T10:59:00.000Z	bob2	penguin42	oh, .ram
