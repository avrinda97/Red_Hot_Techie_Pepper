2006-03-24T06:48:00.000Z	ozgurgerilla	saaber	it says: reboot and select proper boot device or insert boot media in selected boot device..
2006-03-24T06:52:00.000Z	saaber	ozgurgerilla	did you check with another bootable cd?
2006-03-24T06:53:00.000Z	ozgurgerilla	saaber	one second plz
2006-03-24T06:56:00.000Z	ozgurgerilla	saaber	my system recovery cd is bootable is that ok?
2006-03-24T06:57:00.000Z	saaber	ozgurgerilla	can you boot your system with that cd?
2006-03-24T06:57:00.000Z	saaber	ozgurgerilla	if you can so your ubuntu cd is the problem
2006-03-24T07:01:00.000Z	saaber	ozgurgerilla	what program did you write your ubuntu with?
2006-03-24T07:01:00.000Z	ozgurgerilla	saaber	magic ISO
2006-03-24T07:10:00.000Z	saaber	ozgurgerilla	at the first screen you see on your monitor enter tab and then you see a CMOS setup utility.... look for somthing like First Boot Device and check it can be set to CDROM
2006-03-24T07:11:00.000Z	ozgurgerilla	saaber	I have a bios setup utility and 1st booting device is my DVD -rom
2006-03-24T07:16:00.000Z	saaber	ozgurgerilla	it doesn`t matter what OS you are running when you want to boot from cd
2006-03-24T07:18:00.000Z	saaber	ozgurgerilla	sometimes it ca be related to your cdrom
2006-03-24T07:18:00.000Z	saaber	ozgurgerilla	for example my cdrom can run any cd except knoppix OS
