2011-09-26T03:24:00.000Z	RocketLauncher		i think internet sharing doesnt work because ubuntu doesnt even recognize my ethernet.. what do i do? god..
2011-09-26T03:25:00.000Z	og01	RocketLauncher	is the network interface showing with the command: ifconfig?
2011-09-26T03:30:00.000Z	og01	RocketLauncher	its all perfectly possible
2011-09-26T03:31:00.000Z	og01	RocketLauncher	but its not particularly simple stuff
2011-09-26T03:31:00.000Z	RocketLauncher	og01	do you know how though?
2011-09-26T03:31:00.000Z	og01	RocketLauncher	yeah pretty much, you can run dnsmasq for dhcp and dns, and then route traffic via your wifi
2011-09-26T03:36:00.000Z	og01	RocketLauncher	its on of those things, linux is perfect for this job - it can do pretty much any networking magic you could ever think of, but on the flip side its never as simple as you would like, and you just need to put in the time reading documentation and understanding networks in general
2011-09-26T03:39:00.000Z	og01	RocketLauncher	does your ethernet port show a link light?
2011-09-26T03:39:00.000Z	og01	RocketLauncher	that guide is esactly what you want to do
2011-09-26T03:39:00.000Z	RocketLauncher	og01	i followed that guide though
2011-09-26T03:39:00.000Z	og01	RocketLauncher	are you usinga  special cross-over cable?
2011-09-26T03:40:00.000Z	og01	RocketLauncher	are you using a hub or switch between the two pc's or are you connecting computer directly to computer?
2011-09-26T03:40:00.000Z	RocketLauncher	og01	directly to computer
2011-09-26T03:40:00.000Z	og01	RocketLauncher	does this cable work udner windows?
2011-09-26T03:41:00.000Z	og01	RocketLauncher	usualy if your connecting a computer directly to another computer you would need a crossover cable, but this applies to windows too
2011-09-26T03:42:00.000Z	RocketLauncher	og01	since it worked on windows could it work on ubantu
2011-09-26T03:42:00.000Z	og01	RocketLauncher	unless as yagoo implied it can be managed or set these days
2011-09-26T03:43:00.000Z	og01	RocketLauncher	well yeah, it should - but the driver level autocrossing of the pairs is news to me
2011-09-26T03:43:00.000Z	og01	RocketLauncher	if you have no link light between the machines thats at the datalink level
2011-09-26T03:43:00.000Z	og01	RocketLauncher	ie its not related to linux or windows
2011-09-26T03:43:00.000Z	og01	RocketLauncher	and you need to sort out the cabling
