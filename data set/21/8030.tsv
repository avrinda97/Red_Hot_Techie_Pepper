2007-01-04T08:30:00.000Z	bruenig	disastorm	figure out where it is saving them
2007-01-04T08:30:00.000Z	bruenig	disastorm	or where it is supposed to save them
2007-01-04T08:30:00.000Z	bruenig	disastorm	should be in one of the hom . directories
2007-01-04T08:34:00.000Z	bruenig	disastorm	I just told you to look for the config file that goes with it, it should be in the home directories, in one of those . directories
2007-01-04T08:37:00.000Z	bruenig	disastorm	yeah open it up in gedit and make it right
2007-01-04T08:40:00.000Z	bruenig	disastorm	just to make sure you have the right permissions and stuff do these two things, sudo chmod 755 ~/.config/autostart/* && sudo chmod username -R ~/.config/autostart/*
2007-01-04T08:40:00.000Z	bruenig	disastorm	change usename for your own
2007-01-04T08:43:00.000Z	bruenig	disastorm	my fault the last command should be chown not chmod
2007-01-04T08:43:00.000Z	bruenig	disastorm	the rest is the same
2007-01-04T08:45:00.000Z	bruenig	disastorm	chown username ~/.config/autostart/*
2007-01-04T08:47:00.000Z	bruenig	disastorm	do the folder then chown username -R ~/.config/autostart
