2011-12-10T22:49:00.000Z	Radium		Guys I've tried playing NaCl games like 'Bastion' and 'Pocket legends' but they keep saying there's problems with my graphics card not supporting OpenGL. I just got my new Lenovo H330 computer with an i5  intel proccesor. Does Ubuntu not support it or something?
2011-12-10T22:49:00.000Z	Barbariandude	Radium	i5s use optimus tech, get ironhide, google it
2011-12-10T22:50:00.000Z	Radium	Barbariandude	You'll have to explain that a little further?
2011-12-10T22:51:00.000Z	Barbariandude	Radium	you need this: https://launchpad.net/~mj-casalogic/+archive/ironhide
2011-12-10T22:52:00.000Z	Radium	Barbariandude	Ah thanks I'll add that PPA. Which packages do I need to install from it?
2011-12-10T22:53:00.000Z	Barbariandude	Radium	Basically, whats going on is that the laptop uses graphics switching to swap between onboard and card graphics. Nvidia never released how it works, so thats a bit of inventive reverse engineering. The package is called ironhide
2011-12-10T22:54:00.000Z	Radium	Barbariandude	Ah okay thanks I'll install it now
2011-12-10T23:08:00.000Z	Radium	Barbariandude	Okay I installed that package and restarted. I tried one of the NaCl games and it worked! But I've also tried two others and they still don't work.
2011-12-10T23:09:00.000Z	Barbariandude	Radium	those are working on your onboard graphics. To use card graphics, you need to prefix the run command with 'optirun'
2011-12-10T23:10:00.000Z	Radium	Barbariandude	But I don't have any graphics card present in the computer. I wanted to use the built in CPU ones.
2011-12-10T23:10:00.000Z	Barbariandude	Radium	oh, then it's working as intended. What errors are the other 2 spitting out?
2011-12-10T23:14:00.000Z	Radium	Barbariandude	I'm going to have to go AFK for a moment I'll notify you of my arrival. Won't be a minute.
2011-12-10T23:24:00.000Z	Radium	Barbariandude	Sorry I'm back now. What's going wrong do you think?
2011-12-10T23:25:00.000Z	Barbariandude	Radium	no clue, which is why I asked what errors you're getting
2011-12-10T23:29:00.000Z	Radium	Barbariandude	oops I said that before but I forgot to include your name so you probably didn't see it.
2011-12-10T23:30:00.000Z	Barbariandude	Radium	yeah, that is a bit of a problem in high-use channels like this
2011-12-10T23:31:00.000Z	Radium	Barbariandude	Before installing ironside 'pocket legends' didn't work at all. Now that it is installed it sometimes works when starting it up. Other times it says your graphics card failed to inilitze
2011-12-10T23:33:00.000Z	Barbariandude	Radium	can you put your /etc/xorg.conf on pastebin for me?
2011-12-10T23:34:00.000Z	Radium	Barbariandude	No such file is present
2011-12-10T23:35:00.000Z	Barbariandude	Radium	that's pretty much impossible... how are you trying to get it? with "gedit /../../etc/xorg.conf"?
2011-12-10T23:36:00.000Z	Radium	Barbariandude	When installing ironside I prompted me to select a model. I think I may have selected 'Acer' by accident. I'm pretty such I didn't though. How can I go back and check that?
