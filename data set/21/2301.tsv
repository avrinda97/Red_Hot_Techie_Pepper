2009-11-11T17:29:00.000Z	Bear10		Is it possible to make all directories but the users own, hidden? that way he cant navigate / copy paste / view anything from the OS itself, or from other users?
2009-11-11T17:31:00.000Z	chrisbschw	Bear10	I don't think so. The user needs to be able to access a whole bunch of stuff in /usr/bin, /etc for the system to work.
2009-11-11T17:32:00.000Z	Bear10	chrisbschw	lets say he can access it but can you make it hidden so its not simply visible? or perhaps password protect it
2009-11-11T17:33:00.000Z	chrisbschw	Bear10	You should rather just chmod o-r the specific files you don't want the user to see. I think the only way to "hide" something in linux is to prefix it with a dot, like /.hiddendir, and that would screw everything up if you did that to the system folders.
2009-11-11T17:34:00.000Z	Bear10	chrisbschw	but even if its just readable, you can copy and paste it to your own directory which then makes it writeable
2009-11-11T17:34:00.000Z	Bear10		i want to prevent them from being able to copy / paste it to their own place
2009-11-11T17:35:00.000Z	chrisbschw	Bear10	By definition, if it's readable, then it's copy/pastable.
2009-11-11T17:35:00.000Z	Bear10	chrisbschw	that much i know, but i want to change this "readable" so you can only run it, and you cant copy / paste, somehow remove those features
2009-11-11T17:36:00.000Z	chrisbschw		Aha, right. You can chmod o-rw on a file to not make it readable, and still being executable I think, but I'm not quite sure. What are you trying to accomplish? Is it a plain text script you want the user to be able to execute, but not read?
2009-11-11T17:52:00.000Z	Bear10	chrisbschw	sorry was eating, yes i want an executable to work which is installed in the OS like firefox or open office, but i dont want a user to be able to copy and paste the application files to their directory
2009-11-11T17:54:00.000Z	chrisbschw	Bear10	I think thats impossible, to execute something you have to be able to read the file. I'm no hardcore expert though, so there might be a way. But I can't think of an easy way to accomplish that. May I ask why you want to do this?
2009-11-11T17:54:00.000Z	Bear10	chrisbschw	to setup a system for my house so no one touches things they shouldnt
2009-11-11T17:54:00.000Z	Bear10		its full of computer illiterates and i dont want them using windows either lol
2009-11-11T17:55:00.000Z	chrisbschw	Bear10	Well. Noone will be able to alter the system files. And the worst thing that can happen is that they mess up their own homedir. By default everything that's supposed to be secret is already chmodded that way so that normal users can't damage the system.
2009-11-11T17:56:00.000Z	Bear10	chrisbschw	well i know that much but im just uneasy with them being able to copy paste stuff they shouldnt, i want to make it so the only things they have in their home directory are things they save from applications
2009-11-11T17:56:00.000Z	Bear10		tryin to limit it to that point
2009-11-11T17:58:00.000Z	chrisbschw	Bear10	Well, all the system stuff is really not a secret. The only thing I can think of I would be uneasy about exposing would be /etc/shadow, which contains MD5 hashes of everyone's passwords. But noone can access that file. Try it yourself without being root.
2009-11-11T17:58:00.000Z	Bear10		chirsbschw, hmph i wish there were some way of making it "invisible" / "hidden" but i guess there really isnt a way
2009-11-11T17:59:00.000Z	Bear10		like itd be okay if it was atleast hidden heh
2009-11-11T18:00:00.000Z	chrisbschw	Bear10	Well, it really is kinda 'invisible', the only way to access it would be having the root password, or removing the disk and reading the files from another system. Either way, if the other people using the system are novices, they really won't end up in / anyway, if they use the GUI primarily.
2009-11-11T18:01:00.000Z	Bear10	chrisbschw	true that, thanks :)
