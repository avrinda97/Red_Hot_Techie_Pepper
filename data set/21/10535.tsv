2005-02-09T09:47:00.000Z	projectmayhem		hey everyone, i'm about to install linux to dual boot on my computer, and  was just wondering if this was the best distro to use or if i should go with another one
2005-02-09T09:47:00.000Z	projectmayhem		i figured
2005-02-09T09:48:00.000Z	projectmayhem		i've been looking at this distro and fedora 3, and was wondering which one was better for day to day use and a little java programming
2005-02-09T09:48:00.000Z	projectmayhem		nophasis: turst me, i'm a major noob
2005-02-09T09:48:00.000Z	projectmayhem		trust*
2005-02-09T09:49:00.000Z	projectmayhem		ok, but neither has any specific advantages?
2005-02-09T09:49:00.000Z	maximaus	projectmayhem	 I've used both, they're both decent. I prefer Ubuntu since it happens to focus on the application I like.
2005-02-09T09:49:00.000Z	projectmayhem	maximaus	what app is that?
2005-02-09T09:50:00.000Z	maximaus	projectmayhem	just various Gnome stuff, Fedora has them too, but it seems that Ubuntu's Gnome is more polished
2005-02-09T09:51:00.000Z	maximaus	projectmayhem	I find Ubuntu to be MUCH faster on my older box, though you could certainly tweak Fedora. Fedora needs a little more TLC to get up to running speed. Ubuntu has a much cooler community IMHO. :P
2005-02-09T09:52:00.000Z	maximaus	projectmayhem	package management stuff is what that is. Apt is a system of installing software from remote secure repositories and resolving any conflicts or dependencies.
2005-02-09T09:53:00.000Z	maximaus	projectmayhem	Synaptic is Ubuntu's graphical front-end for the apt utility.
2005-02-09T09:59:00.000Z	maximaus	projectmayhem	just create a link on the desktop that opens a terminal window and spews a bunch of text, label it "antivirus". :D
2005-02-09T09:59:00.000Z	projectmayhem	maximaus	haha, not a bad idea
2005-02-09T10:04:00.000Z	maximaus	projectmayhem	you only need around 3g for software. I do recommend creating both a / and a /home partition with the installer.
2005-02-09T10:05:00.000Z	maximaus	projectmayhem	I've got 2x the software of a base install and I'm still way under 3g
2005-02-09T10:06:00.000Z	maximaus	projectmayhem	 I'd just create a 3-5G /partition for software and a /home partition large enough for your personal files.
2005-02-09T10:06:00.000Z	maximaus	projectmayhem	are you partitioning a windows XP disc?
2005-02-09T10:07:00.000Z	projectmayhem	maximaus	i'm running xp right now, no extra partitions or anything
2005-02-09T10:07:00.000Z	maximaus	projectmayhem	Partition magic is really the way to go.
2005-02-09T10:08:00.000Z	maximaus	projectmayhem	or get a cheap 2nd drive somewhere. ;)
