2006-12-27T17:14:00.000Z	Yodude		and another question: i have a NETGEAR FA311 fast ehternet network card
2006-12-27T17:14:00.000Z	Yodude		is it supported ( i know how to configure my xconnection in windows)
2006-12-27T17:15:00.000Z	Yodude		but that's where i'm confused, if something goes wrong will i even be able to reboot with WINDOWS?
2006-12-27T17:15:00.000Z	Yodude		by re-configuring BIOS?
2006-12-27T17:16:00.000Z	Yodude		ok one more question ( lol i ask a lot of question cuz i'm totally new to linux)
2006-12-27T17:16:00.000Z	Yodude		updates: i can install updates when running the liveCD yes?
2006-12-27T17:17:00.000Z	Yodude		i mean "can't"
2006-12-27T17:17:00.000Z	alex-weej	Yodude	you can but there's little point
2006-12-27T17:17:00.000Z	alex-weej	Yodude	why do you want to install updates from the livecd?
2006-12-27T17:17:00.000Z	alex-weej	Yodude	any changes you make to the LiveCD environment are lost when you shut it down.
2006-12-27T17:22:00.000Z	alex-weej	Yodude	Windows XP uses the "NTFS" file system, which is proprietary and had to be largely reverse-engineered. Write support for it is not enabled by default in Linux due to risk of data loss.
2006-12-27T17:23:00.000Z	alex-weej	Yodude	FAT32 is 100% supported (the specification is open)
2006-12-27T17:27:00.000Z	alex-weej	Yodude	just ask
2006-12-27T17:28:00.000Z	alex-weej	Yodude	no.
2006-12-27T17:30:00.000Z	alex-weej	Yodude	we can already run Windows software
2006-12-27T17:31:00.000Z	alex-weej	Yodude	a lot of people spent a lot of time coding an open source version of the Windows libraries so we can run Windows software. it's called "Wine"
2006-12-27T17:32:00.000Z	alex-weej	Yodude	network effect
2006-12-27T17:32:00.000Z	alex-weej	Yodude	it's beneficial for most people to simply use what everyone else uses.
