2010-08-16T19:49:00.000Z	abstrakt		and now it appears in the list of VPN Connections when I click on my network icon in my panel/tray thing
2010-08-16T19:49:00.000Z	abstrakt		but, when I select that VPN connection essentially "nothing happens"
2010-08-16T19:50:00.000Z	abstrakt		i don't get a window, I don't get an error, I don't get an error window
2010-08-16T19:50:00.000Z	abstrakt		just... nothing
2010-08-16T19:50:00.000Z	abstrakt		how can I troubleshoot my vpn connection?
2010-08-16T19:51:00.000Z	bons	abstrakt	wich vpn server/client are you using?
2010-08-16T19:51:00.000Z	abstrakt	bons	openvpn
2010-08-16T19:52:00.000Z	abstrakt	bons	yes?
2010-08-16T19:52:00.000Z	abstrakt	bons	i answered your question
2010-08-16T19:52:00.000Z	abstrakt	bons	openvpn
2010-08-16T19:54:00.000Z	abstrakt	bons	where can I find the syntax for launching openvpn from the commandline?
2010-08-16T19:54:00.000Z	bons	abstrakt	everything can be executed by cl... just type openvpn --help
2010-08-16T19:54:00.000Z	abstrakt	bons	ok well I have a zip file that my sysadmin gave me with the certs and a conf file. I set up a connection in the VPN network manager and selected my certs, but I didn't see anywhere to specify my conf file
2010-08-16T20:00:00.000Z	bons	abstrakt	exctly
2010-08-16T20:08:00.000Z	abstrakt	bons	I've got a few vhosts set up on my work computer...
2010-08-16T20:07:00.000Z	abstrakt	bons	er... yah ok like how so? like what's an example command I should likely be able to run?
2010-08-16T20:08:00.000Z	abstrakt	bons	e.g. http://somesite.mydev/ and http://foosite.mydev/
2010-08-16T20:09:00.000Z	bons	abstrakt	once you are connected to the openvpn server, you should be able to communicate with the other hosts joined in the vpn
2010-08-16T20:10:00.000Z	abstrakt	bons	er... yeah, sorry to be so verbose but how? the openvpn output simply says Initialization Sequence Completed
2010-08-16T20:11:00.000Z	bons	abstrakt	you have a new network interface and can communicate with the other hosts of the same network depending how your sysad configured, you can check your virtual interface running the command ifconfig or ifconfig tap0
2010-08-16T20:11:00.000Z	bons	abstrakt	yes
