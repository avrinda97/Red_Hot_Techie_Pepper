2010-02-28T00:29:00.000Z	a|3x		why the bloody crap did it delete my script
2010-02-28T00:29:00.000Z	a|3x		whoever works on the ext3 kernel code is an idiot
2010-02-28T00:30:00.000Z	guntbert	a|3x	watch you language - and start with telling your problem
2010-02-28T00:30:00.000Z	a|3x	guntbert	no, the script which i worked on for hours was gone
2010-02-28T00:31:00.000Z	a|3x	guntbert	wtf, it should have told me that there is not enough disk space, not purge my script!
2010-02-28T00:32:00.000Z	guntbert	a|3x	until you manage to use nice language I won't talk with you
2010-02-28T00:32:00.000Z	a|3x	guntbert	sorry, i am not a happy camper now
2010-02-28T00:35:00.000Z	a|3x	guntbert	wirechief: so basically, nano tried to save my script and it thought it saved but it appears the kernel tried to allocate new blocks but didn't and reset the the original pointers or something
2010-02-28T00:36:00.000Z	a|3x	guntbert	wirechief: no ~ backup, by the way
2010-02-28T00:38:00.000Z	a|3x	guntbert	wirechief: and this is not the only annoying problem with unstable ubuntu code, even lts
2010-02-28T00:39:00.000Z	a|3x	guntbert	wirechief: no, i noticed this problem some time ago, my disk works fine
2010-02-28T00:39:00.000Z	a|3x	guntbert	wirechief: but i will do fsck
2010-02-28T00:39:00.000Z	guntbert	a|3x	please stop that ranting - all that happened was you made an error by filling up your disk
2010-02-28T00:40:00.000Z	a|3x	guntbert	wirechief: well, actually, the script records video and it was unable to mount remote smb share so it saved everything to the disk until it filled up
2010-02-28T00:40:00.000Z	a|3x	guntbert	wirechief: i deleted some files, so i got space now, but too late
2010-02-28T00:41:00.000Z	a|3x	guntbert	wirechief: sorry about ranting, but i gave ubuntu many tries and had problems every time, debian was much more stable
2010-02-28T00:42:00.000Z	guntbert	a|3x	so you learned a lesson: watch your free space :-)
2010-02-28T00:42:00.000Z	a|3x	guntbert	wirechief: for example, my ubuntu lts server installation is having strange "cpu stuck" messages to do with iscsi target daemon, wtf
2010-02-28T00:43:00.000Z	a|3x	guntbert	wirechief: and why did they moved on to kde 4 before it was ready for production use?
2010-02-28T00:44:00.000Z	a|3x	guntbert	wirechief: oh i have learned my lesson, don't use unstable kernel such as the one ubuntu provides, common, when i run out of space i should be getting out of space messages, not files perged...
2010-02-28T00:45:00.000Z	a|3x	guntbert	wirechief: it could have been nano, i need to investigate more
