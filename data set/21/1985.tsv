2010-04-09T21:10:00.000Z	itheos		i dont want to enter password everytime i try to mount a partition. what to do?
2010-04-09T21:11:00.000Z	jrib	itheos	do you want it to automatically be mounted on boot?
2010-05-30T18:16:00.000Z	jrib	itheos	you should tell the channel exactly what permissions you changed
2010-05-30T18:17:00.000Z	itheos	jrib	and the channel, i did "chown -R user:user /" and "chmod -R a+rwxXst /" to the best of my knowledge
2010-05-30T18:17:00.000Z	jrib	itheos	reinstall
2010-05-30T18:17:00.000Z	itheos	jrib	why so?
2010-05-30T18:18:00.000Z	jrib	itheos	because you basically broke the permissions on every file in your system.  (don't do that when you reinstall)  Why did you decide to do that?
2010-05-30T18:18:00.000Z	itheos	jrib	i didnt know it would do this. cant i get the list of original permissions? or someway to undo it?
2010-05-30T18:19:00.000Z	jrib	itheos	reinstall is the easiest way
2010-05-30T18:33:00.000Z	itheos	jrib	thanks you too :)
2010-05-30T18:34:00.000Z	jrib	itheos	you messed up more files, you need to reinstall
2010-05-30T18:35:00.000Z	itheos	jrib	ok thanks but isnt there any way so that i can retain the softwares installed and the settings. settings wil be from the user dir. what about the programs? make a script and reinstall?
2010-05-30T18:36:00.000Z	jrib	itheos	see above
2010-05-30T18:37:00.000Z	itheos	jrib	thanks man :)
2010-05-30T18:37:00.000Z	jrib	itheos	you know that when you need access to a file your user isn't the owner of you just use sudo from now on?
2010-05-30T18:38:00.000Z	itheos	jrib	i am root now. i have logged in as root. i wont have problems doing it, will i?
2010-05-30T18:38:00.000Z	jrib	itheos	yeah, that's fine
2010-05-30T18:39:00.000Z	itheos	jrib	thanks :)
2010-05-30T18:47:00.000Z	itheos	jrib	if i am root then will i get packages installed for root only or all the packages for all the users?
2010-05-30T18:48:00.000Z	jrib	itheos	packages are installed on the system, not for each user
2010-05-30T18:48:00.000Z	itheos	jrib	wieshka thanks :)
