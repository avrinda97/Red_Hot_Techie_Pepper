2007-08-25T05:11:00.000Z	rexy		close ompaul :P
2007-08-25T05:12:00.000Z	rexy		bulio there's a guide in the forum
2007-08-25T05:13:00.000Z	rexy		are the ubuntuforums down? they wont load for me
2007-08-25T05:13:00.000Z	rexy		odd
2007-08-25T05:14:00.000Z	rexy		hhmm they work from a different computer just fine
2007-08-25T05:15:00.000Z	rexy		not likely
2007-08-25T05:15:00.000Z	rexy		i use ndiswrapper too to get wpa working
2007-08-25T05:16:00.000Z	rexy		is the driver spelled correctly in the blacklist
2007-08-25T05:16:00.000Z	rexy		but appearantly the 23 kernel is going to bring better support
2007-08-25T05:17:00.000Z	rexy		and did you disable networkmanager?
2007-08-25T05:18:00.000Z	nickrud	rexy	is it generally true that ndiswrapper is necessary for wpa?
2007-08-25T05:18:00.000Z	rexy		ah
2007-08-25T05:18:00.000Z	rexy		try disabling it anyway and see if that solves the problem
2007-08-25T05:19:00.000Z	rexy		quite likely it loads the wrong drivers?
2007-08-25T05:19:00.000Z	rexy	nickrud	depends
2007-08-25T05:19:00.000Z	nickrud	rexy	not to put you on the spot or anything
2007-08-25T05:19:00.000Z	rexy		well you can move/delete them
2007-08-25T05:19:00.000Z	rexy		they are under the /lib/modules tree somewhere
2007-08-25T05:19:00.000Z	rexy		they are named the same as in lsmod
2007-08-25T05:20:00.000Z	rexy	nickrud	that's ok, not sure about every driver, but the open source for my driver has no wpa support, just the windows driver has, hence i use that through ndiswrapper
2007-08-25T05:20:00.000Z	nickrud	rexy	ok, case by case. Thanks
