2007-11-25T12:56:00.000Z	Radi01		add remove
2007-11-25T12:57:00.000Z	Radi01		I have used Ubuntu and had no problems/Now I am trying Kubuntu it acts funky
2007-11-25T12:58:00.000Z	ompaul	Radi01	use guarddog in its place
2007-11-25T12:58:00.000Z	Radi01		Is it comparable?
2007-11-25T12:59:00.000Z	Radi01		no
2007-11-25T13:00:00.000Z	Radi01		when i got root i  tried to start firestarter  and it says it needed a make install-
2007-11-25T13:01:00.000Z	ompaul	Radi01	you have not installed it correctly you are trying to compile it -- this is a package based distro you don't have to install from source. Do this: sudo apt-get install firestarter
2007-11-25T13:02:00.000Z	Radi01		add remove  because adept didnt respond..U think my disk might be bad?
2007-11-25T13:02:00.000Z	Radi01		il try brb
2007-11-25T13:02:00.000Z	ompaul	Radi01	no idea you might have corrupted your install in some way - best thing there is to back up your data and install freshly if you you want to test
2007-11-25T13:03:00.000Z	ompaul		!quicktime | scrapbunny
2007-11-25T13:03:00.000Z	Radi01		k ompaul/thanks...1 thing though..the first time i installed kubuntu it worked flawlessly..interesting
2007-11-25T13:05:00.000Z	ompaul	Radi01	then something has broken and ehh you need to work out what it is - sounds like you are unsure of what you have so I would strongly suggest, back up your data and reinstall - if it breaks again randomly then consider a new disk
2007-11-25T13:05:00.000Z	Radi01		E: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem.
2007-11-25T13:05:00.000Z	ompaul	Radi01	you did break your system do sudo dpkg --configure -a and see how you are then
