2007-03-21T06:04:00.000Z	LordLimecat		whats the method of referring to a files name when doing a move?
2007-03-21T06:04:00.000Z	LordLimecat		ie, if i wanted to move 'mv filename001 ..\filename001' what would be shorthand
2007-03-21T06:05:00.000Z	bruenig	LordLimecat	don't know if I quite understand you, mv file ..
2007-03-21T06:05:00.000Z	LordLimecat	bruenig	i want to issue the equivalent command to 'mv thisfile001 ../thisfile001'
2007-03-21T06:06:00.000Z	bruenig	LordLimecat	that path is the same place
2007-03-21T06:07:00.000Z	bruenig	LordLimecat	oh it is,  mv file ..
2007-03-21T06:07:00.000Z	bruenig	LordLimecat	mv file /path/to/directory
