2011-08-20T05:01:00.000Z	hylian	marriedman624	let me see if i can find a package for that, because 9.10 is no longer supported, or so i thought.
2011-08-20T05:04:00.000Z	hylian	marriedman624	if your looking for the us english version, this page will download a fiel you can install it with: http://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-6.0&os=linux&lang=en-US
2011-08-20T05:06:00.000Z	hylian	marriedman624	9.10 repos will NOT be updated, because it's no longer supported. as for the tar.gz file, that's a zipped file, have you ever used compressed files before?
2011-08-20T05:07:00.000Z	marriedman624	hylian	I have never really figured them out on ubuntu......i have the tar.gz file.......can you PM me and help me out?
