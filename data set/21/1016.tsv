2011-03-05T23:14:00.000Z	flexd		Hi, i'm having some trouble with sound.
2011-03-05T23:14:00.000Z	flexd		I had sound earlier (fresh install of ubuntu x64 today) when logging in
2011-03-05T23:14:00.000Z	flexd		But now there is none
2011-03-05T23:14:00.000Z	flexd		It even worked on youtube, not sure what might be wrong
2011-03-05T23:15:00.000Z	waxrose	flexd	If all your sound settings are up, try going into a terminal and pressing the command "alsamixer" and check to make sure all your sound options are up.
2011-03-05T23:15:00.000Z	flexd		It's a built in intel card on a Asus P5K premium wifi/ap
2011-03-05T23:16:00.000Z	flexd	waxrose	they all seem up
2011-03-05T23:16:00.000Z	waxrose	flexd	Did you restart your computer after you noticed sound disappeared?
2011-03-05T23:17:00.000Z	flexd		I have yea
2011-03-05T23:17:00.000Z	flexd		No sound when booting now :-/
2011-03-05T23:18:00.000Z	waxrose	flexd	try this in your terminal --> sudo /etc/init.d/alsa-utils restart
2011-03-05T23:18:00.000Z	flexd	waxrose	there is no alsa-utils
2011-03-05T23:19:00.000Z	waxrose	flexd	sudo alsa force-reload ?
2011-03-05T23:19:00.000Z	flexd	waxrose	it's in /sbin, did it anyway
2011-03-05T23:19:00.000Z	flexd		I've tried force reloading
2011-03-05T23:20:00.000Z	flexd	waxrose	it's alive!
2011-03-05T23:20:00.000Z	waxrose	flexd	What fixed the issue?
2011-03-05T23:20:00.000Z	flexd		sudo alsa-utils restart
2011-03-05T23:20:00.000Z	waxrose	flexd	Great. :)
2011-03-05T23:21:00.000Z	waxrose	flexd	Some times it likes to crash and not start up so, now you know for future reference. :)
2011-03-05T23:21:00.000Z	flexd	waxrose	nice, i'll just remember that :)
