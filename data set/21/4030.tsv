2009-10-10T18:29:00.000Z	lolmac		O.o
2009-10-10T18:29:00.000Z	Boohbah	lolmac	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_bridge
2009-10-10T18:30:00.000Z	Boohbah	lolmac	have you enabled ipv4 forwarding in your kernel?
2009-10-10T18:31:00.000Z	Boohbah	lolmac	are you packets going between networks?
2009-10-10T18:31:00.000Z	Boohbah	lolmac	i don't have experience with ADSL modems so i can't be of much help, sorry :(
2009-10-10T18:31:00.000Z	Boohbah	lolmac	what is your internet gateway? ADSL?
2009-10-10T18:32:00.000Z	Boohbah	lolmac	is the ADSL hooked up to USB directly to your box or is there a router in between?
2009-10-10T18:33:00.000Z	Boohbah	lolmac	ok, then you don't want to setup an ADSL interface in ubuntu
2009-10-10T18:34:00.000Z	Boohbah	lolmac	you only want to have a local network interface, set it up to get a local dhcp IP address from your router.
2009-10-10T18:34:00.000Z	Boohbah	lolmac	no ADSL interface needed in ubuntu for your setup
2009-10-10T18:35:00.000Z	Boohbah	lolmac	your router will do NAT and translate the packets. also, try to type on one line :)
2009-10-10T18:37:00.000Z	lolmac	Boohbah	okay, i will type in one line, but i have to use that pppoeconf of terminal to the internet work?
2009-10-10T18:38:00.000Z	Boohbah	lolmac	no, not if you have a standard router. you will just need to get an IP address from DHCP from your router. http://www.ubuntugeek.com/ubuntu-networking-configuration-using-command-line.html
2009-10-10T18:38:00.000Z	lolmac	Boohbah	but my connection is bridge
2009-10-10T18:38:00.000Z	Boohbah	lolmac	why?
2009-10-10T18:39:00.000Z	Boohbah	lolmac	you said there was nothing between you and the router, no?
2009-10-10T18:45:00.000Z	lolmac	Boohbah	a ethernet cable gets out of my pc and enters an wireless router, that enters the modem, that is set to bridge to connect to the internet (i have to create an connection with username and password, it does not connect automatically)
2009-10-10T18:45:00.000Z	Boohbah	lolmac	you don't need a bridge interface in ubuntu then, the router handles that. you only need a standard dhcp interface which is setup out of the box.
2009-10-10T18:46:00.000Z	Boohbah	lolmac	sorry i didn't read the last part. do you have to authenticate the connection from your PC? if so i don't know how to do it
2009-10-10T18:46:00.000Z	Boohbah	lolmac	i see. maybe someone else knows more about authenticating to bridged ADSL interfaces.
