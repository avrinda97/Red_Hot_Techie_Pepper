2008-10-18T02:52:00.000Z	Some_Person	hajar	How big is your swap partition?
2008-10-18T02:53:00.000Z	Some_Person	hajar	Wait, you have an entire hard drive dedicated to almost useless swap space?
2008-10-18T02:53:00.000Z	Some_Person	hajar	There's no need to do that. That just makes the drive unusable to you
2008-10-18T02:54:00.000Z	Some_Person	hajar	Your swap drive really should be just a little more than your RAM when you have more than 1GB of RAM
2008-10-18T03:13:00.000Z	Some_Person	hajar	If ubuntu is running at all you have a swap partition
2008-10-18T03:14:00.000Z	Some_Person	hajar	Open up the Partition Editor (sudo apt-get gparted) and then you'll see it
2008-10-18T03:14:00.000Z	Some_Person	hajar	Sorry that should be sudo apt-get install gparted
2008-10-18T03:16:00.000Z	Some_Person	hajar	You don't need swap to run ubuntu, but you do to hibernate
2008-10-18T03:18:00.000Z	Some_Person	hajar	You have a swap
2008-10-18T03:19:00.000Z	Some_Person	hajar	It is way more than you actually need if you have 2GB of RAM
2008-10-18T03:20:00.000Z	Some_Person	hajar	That should be enough swap to hibernate
2008-10-18T03:20:00.000Z	Some_Person	hajar	6GB of swap is way more than you need.
2008-10-18T03:21:00.000Z	Some_Person	hajar	No
2008-10-18T03:21:00.000Z	Some_Person	hajar	Decreasing the swap will not fix it
2008-10-18T03:21:00.000Z	Some_Person	hajar	Besides, your swap needs to be more than your RAM, not less
2008-10-18T03:21:00.000Z	Some_Person	hajar	Your problem is not swap-related
