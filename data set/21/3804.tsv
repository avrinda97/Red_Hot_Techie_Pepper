2009-02-10T05:11:00.000Z	jobless		hey guys, can anyone help me find out why my usb pci card is not working on 8.04?
2009-02-10T05:11:00.000Z	rootsnatch	jobless	shure whats lsusb saying?
2009-02-10T05:12:00.000Z	jobless	rootsnatch	I am using a belkin 5 port USB 2.0 pci card. My system gives some ata errors and won't boot up
2009-02-10T05:12:00.000Z	jobless	rootsnatch	it boots up when I remove the card.
2009-02-10T05:13:00.000Z	rootsnatch	jobless	there are ata errors?
2009-02-10T05:13:00.000Z	jobless	rootsnatch	yes
2009-02-10T05:14:00.000Z	jobless	rootsnatch	ata1 failed to recover some devices is the specific error. It then throws me a initramfs prompt
2009-02-10T05:14:00.000Z	rootsnatch	jobless	hmmm have you googled around?
2009-02-10T05:15:00.000Z	jobless	rootsnatch	yes, I found that one solution was to edit, /etc/intiramfs-tools/modules .. but I don't even have the initramfs-tools directory under etc
2009-02-10T05:16:00.000Z	jobless	rootsnatch	i found that solution on launchpad, bug 104581
2009-02-10T05:17:00.000Z	rootsnatch	jobless	hmmmmm
2009-02-10T05:19:00.000Z	rootsnatch	jobless	are you sure you dont have the initramfs-tools directory
2009-02-10T05:19:00.000Z	jobless	rootsnatch	wait, i see the directory now when I booted up the machine (w/o the card). But the solution is for hard disks. Any other Ideas?
2009-02-10T05:20:00.000Z	jobless	rootsnatch	I didn't see the directory when I was in initramfs prompt
2009-02-10T05:22:00.000Z	rootsnatch	jobless	i think you should try the fix, it looks like that card is playing around with the ata card so this might work
2009-02-10T05:22:00.000Z	jobless	rootsnatch	hehe, why not. I am doing it now :)
2009-02-10T05:22:00.000Z	rootsnatch	jobless	make sure to make a backup of copy of the file just in case
2009-02-10T05:23:00.000Z	jobless	rootsnatch	I see that it is just some comments right now
2009-02-10T05:23:00.000Z	rootsnatch	jobless	right just make a backup up copy in case
2009-02-10T05:23:00.000Z	rootsnatch	jobless	and then edit away
2009-02-10T05:25:00.000Z	jobless	rootsnatch	I did ;) and now I am done and about to reboot.. brb
