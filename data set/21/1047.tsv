2012-05-25T22:17:00.000Z	hairydog		I just want to see what folders I have shared so far

2012-05-25T22:17:00.000Z	hairydog		hang on 1 sec
2012-05-25T22:18:00.000Z	roasted_	hairydog	what's the goal here? To have shared folders on Ubuntu that Windows can access?
2012-05-25T22:20:00.000Z	roasted_	hairydog	that guide looks good. However, if you want a more "no bs" way to configure samba, check out system-config-samba... it's a small but easy to use GUI to handle those tasks.
2012-05-25T22:20:00.000Z	roasted_	hairydog	personally, when I began to tinker with samba, the config file kind of had me confused, so I would make changes in the gui and check the config file to see what the gui changed. From there, I learned much quicker.
2012-05-25T22:20:00.000Z	roasted_	hairydog	yes
2012-05-25T22:20:00.000Z	roasted_	hairydog	it's also in the software center, listed as "samba", but just run that in terminal and you'll download it.
2012-05-25T22:21:00.000Z	roasted_	hairydog	it'll show up in your menu as Samba... need root to open the application. From there you can set up shares and whatnot. You'll see when you get there, but like I said, check out the smb.conf when you're done making changes. It'll help you learn.
2012-05-25T22:21:00.000Z	roasted_	hairydog	it's a good platform. We're porting from Mac to Ubuntu here at work.
2012-05-25T22:21:00.000Z	roasted_	hairydog	just keep your resources in mind... ubuntuforums, this IRC channel, etc.
2012-05-25T22:22:00.000Z	roasted_	hairydog	nice. I think it looks pretty good by default anyway :P
2012-05-25T22:25:00.000Z	roasted_	hairydog	it's all about the game maker. Ubuntu itself is a good gaming platform.... but you need games... whcih game makers aren't caving to just yet.
2012-05-25T22:27:00.000Z	roasted_	hairydog	beware of bazhang. He holds the magical ban hammer.
2012-05-25T22:28:00.000Z	roasted_	hairydog	I'd drop it bro... he holds the ban hammer.
