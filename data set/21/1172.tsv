2011-01-09T18:00:00.000Z	bootissue		Dr_willis: im sorry.. im still pretty new to unix-linux-ubuntu.. i mean to say. i recently added the lubuntu and xubuntu desktops.. and they added alot to my system and slowed it down alot.. i tried to fix it by removing some of the programs from startup but im an idiot i guess..
2011-01-09T18:01:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	bootissue	I'm confused, do you have an error or specific problem now?

2011-01-09T18:55:00.000Z	bootissue	q_a_z_steve	can a file be replaced with one from the iso of ubuntu to fix this
2011-01-09T18:56:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	bootissue	no, it won't know your stuff, not that simple. You can reinstall the entire OS and it will fix it.
2011-01-09T18:57:00.000Z	bootissue	q_a_z_steve	with a usb and unetbootin
2011-01-09T18:57:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	bootissue	sorry, what about them>
2011-01-09T18:58:00.000Z	bootissue	q_a_z_steve	is that how i can reinstall??
2011-01-09T18:59:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	bootissue	however you got Ubuntu install media before, do that.
2011-01-09T19:00:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	bootissue	It will blow away everything.

2011-01-09T19:04:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	bootissue	that too.
2011-01-09T19:06:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	bootissue	you couldn't get xubuntu from the software center
2011-01-09T19:11:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	bootissue	don't complicate the issue, do you have a CD drive?
2011-01-09T19:12:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	bootissue	like I said, if that's what you did before, you CAN do that.
