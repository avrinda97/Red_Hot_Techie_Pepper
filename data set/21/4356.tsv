2008-05-09T00:16:00.000Z	thorny_sun		can anyone tell me if i should be installing 64bit Heron or 32bit Heron on my core 2 duo?
2008-05-09T00:17:00.000Z	thorny_sun		so why not 64bit?
2008-05-09T00:17:00.000Z	gjaekel	thorny_sun	Use 32bit, if you do'nt know if you need 64bit.
2008-05-09T00:18:00.000Z	gjaekel	thorny_sun	Do you have a desktop computer or a server?
2008-05-09T00:18:00.000Z	thorny_sun	gjaekel	desktop
2008-05-09T00:18:00.000Z	gjaekel	thorny_sun	No all sofware you'll probabely intend to use will exists as 64bit.
2008-05-09T00:19:00.000Z	gjaekel	thorny_sun	E.g. some common used plugins for web browsers
2008-05-09T00:20:00.000Z	gjaekel	thorny_sun	How much RAM you have?
2008-05-09T00:20:00.000Z	thorny_sun	gjaekel	: 3gb
2008-05-09T00:20:00.000Z	gjaekel	thorny_sun	No need to use 64bit from that point of view.
2008-05-09T00:21:00.000Z	thorny_sun	gjaekel	so i won't be missing out on some super speed gain by keeping it with 3bit?
2008-05-09T00:21:00.000Z	gjaekel	thorny_sun	For 99% not.
2008-05-09T00:22:00.000Z	gjaekel	thorny_sun	Some things even might be slower on 64bit.
2008-05-09T00:23:00.000Z	gjaekel	thorny_sun	If you inted to set up a server (web, database, java applicaiton, ...), we will answer: Yes, choose 64bit.
2008-05-09T00:24:00.000Z	thorny_sun	gjaekel	i do do development, so i would intend to use it for that stuff some of the time, but it's still gotta function as a normal desktop as well...
2008-05-09T00:24:00.000Z	gjaekel	thorny_sun	Don't do, offert it at ebay :)
2008-05-09T00:25:00.000Z	thorny_sun	gjaekel	: huh?
2008-05-09T00:25:00.000Z	thorny_sun	gjaekel	: u lost me
2008-05-09T00:25:00.000Z	gjaekel	thorny_sun	Or even try to boot with it. You'll see if it's running. With the time, the restrictions mentioned with desktop applications will fall.
2008-05-09T00:27:00.000Z	thorny_sun	gjaekel	do you think one day desktop users will all be using 64bit apps, or do you think 32bit may be a sweet spot?
2008-05-09T00:30:00.000Z	gjaekel	thorny_sun	The common amount of RAM in a PC will rise further. At more than 3GB, there's some oddity on the common 32bit memory layout on PCs - for Linux and for Windows, too . From that, 64bit will break through.
