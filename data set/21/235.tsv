2012-05-10T13:45:00.000Z	OriginalYankster		*Mbp for creating usb, trying to boot into stationary PC
2012-05-10T13:45:00.000Z	ikonia	OriginalYankster	what hardware are you running on ?
2012-05-10T13:45:00.000Z	ikonia	OriginalYankster	sorry, which one are you running on a macbook or a PC
2012-05-10T13:52:00.000Z	OriginalYankster	ikonia	running on MBP, trying to install on fresh homebuilt rack. motherboard is Asus p5q pro if that's of any help
2012-05-10T13:53:00.000Z	ikonia	OriginalYankster	sorry, I'm not following - what hardware platform are you trying to install ubuntu to
2012-05-10T14:48:00.000Z	ikonia	OriginalYankster	again, I'm still not sure what hardware platform you're actually trying to install to
2012-05-10T14:48:00.000Z	ikonia	OriginalYankster	could you please confirm what you are trying to install to
2012-05-10T14:56:00.000Z	OriginalYankster	ikonia	thanks for sticking with me on this! I'm not sure what you mean by hardware platform... could you elaborate for a lesser technical dude? =P
2012-05-10T14:57:00.000Z	ikonia	OriginalYankster	"what type of machine are you trying to install ubuntu onto "
2012-05-10T14:59:00.000Z	OriginalYankster	ikonia	ah... It's a home built, no specific model... Stationary cabinet w/ Asus p5q pro motherboard, Sapphire Radeon grahpics and 8gb ram
2012-05-10T14:59:00.000Z	ikonia	OriginalYankster	ok, but it's an "x86" or "intel" style computer, not the mac platform
2012-05-10T15:00:00.000Z	OriginalYankster	ikonia	intel, not a mac platform
2012-05-10T15:00:00.000Z	ikonia	OriginalYankster	ok, is there a reason you're not just doing a standard install from CD
2012-05-10T15:07:00.000Z	OriginalYankster	ikonia	yes, the machine has no optic drive =P i've already created the USB AND had it successfully boot into Ubuntu on my PC with no OS - then realizing I forgot to connect my HDD to it's SATA port. Powered down, plugged in HDD, now all I get "isolinux.bin missing or corrupt".. *scratches head*
2012-05-10T15:08:00.000Z	ikonia	OriginalYankster	plugging in your hard disk has probably changed the order of your disks in the bios
2012-05-10T15:12:00.000Z	OriginalYankster	ikonia	have tried formatting USB and starting over, as well as played wildly boot priority/device emulation and still nothing... leaning towards tip from <Wipster> that USB is screwed...
2012-05-10T15:13:00.000Z	ikonia	OriginalYankster	unplug your disk and try to boot the USB disk, does it still work again ?
2012-05-10T15:20:00.000Z	OriginalYankster	ikonia	i'll be darned.. Nope, doesn't work. USB skrewd?
2012-05-10T15:20:00.000Z	ikonia	OriginalYankster	it certainly sounds that way
2012-05-10T15:24:00.000Z	OriginalYankster	ikonia	all right, out for a new USB pen it is! Thank you guys for all your help!
