2008-11-14T02:35:00.000Z	joaopinto	c0p3rn1c	the idea is not to "reboot" the x server, is to reboot the system :)
2008-11-14T02:35:00.000Z	c0p3rn1c	joaopinto	aha :)
2008-12-30T19:51:00.000Z	c0p3rn1c	joaopinto	how do I set it up to type these symbols?
2008-12-30T19:51:00.000Z	joaopinto	c0p3rn1c	you need to select the keymap matching your kbd language, is is not just about "querty"
2008-12-30T19:52:00.000Z	joaopinto	c0p3rn1c	on my case I use such symbols, with a portuguese keyboard
2008-12-30T19:52:00.000Z	c0p3rn1c	joaopinto	I'm using them because I'm learning french
2008-12-30T19:52:00.000Z	joaopinto	c0p3rn1c	selecting another querty layout for a keyboard from a language which does not use them, will not work, you need to know your kbd layout
2008-12-30T19:53:00.000Z	c0p3rn1c	joaopinto	ok I'll try
2008-12-30T19:54:00.000Z	joaopinto	c0p3rn1c	I believe the proper term for what you are trying to achieve is "dead keys"
2008-12-30T19:55:00.000Z	c0p3rn1c	joaopinto	is there any easy way in switching between layouts?
2008-12-30T19:56:00.000Z	joaopinto	c0p3rn1c	now that I am reading about the "dead keys", you should just keep your regular layout (matching your regular keyboard), but instead enable the dead keys functionality

2009-04-30T14:33:00.000Z	joaopinto	c0p3rn1c	what do think it's related to pulseaudio ?
2009-04-30T14:34:00.000Z	c0p3rn1c	joaopinto	since I recently changed my default audio device to pulse
