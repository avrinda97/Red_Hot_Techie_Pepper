2007-07-18T08:42:00.000Z	FFForever		how do i burn an iso in ubuntu?
2007-07-18T08:43:00.000Z	cables	FFForever	right click in and hit "write to disc"
2007-07-18T08:43:00.000Z	cables	FFForever	however, if you notice reliability problems with that burner, there's something you can do that may fix it.
2007-07-18T08:45:00.000Z	cables	FFForever	you mean the way to improve reliability?
2007-07-18T08:45:00.000Z	cables	FFForever	alt-f2 and type "gconf-editor"
2007-07-18T08:45:00.000Z	cables	FFForever	when that's open I'll tell you more
2007-07-18T08:45:00.000Z	cables	FFForever	don't
2007-07-18T08:46:00.000Z	cables	FFForever	hold on
2007-07-18T08:46:00.000Z	cables	FFForever	you haven't fixed the reliability thing yet, so let's do that first
2007-07-18T08:46:00.000Z	cables	FFForever	okay, when the gconf-editor thing pops up just tell me and we'll continue
2007-07-18T08:47:00.000Z	cables	FFForever	have you tried Xubuntu?
2007-07-18T08:47:00.000Z	cables	FFForever	ah, ok.
2007-07-18T08:48:00.000Z	cables	FFForever	you clearly haven't tried KDE. Now THAT'S different from Gnome.
2007-07-18T08:48:00.000Z	cables	FFForever	if you like certain elements of Gnome, you can mix and match
2007-07-18T08:49:00.000Z	cables	FFForever	now, in the configuration editor window, go to /apps/nautilus-cd-burner
2007-07-18T08:49:00.000Z	cables	FFForever	in the right panel you should see a few options. You should then check off Burnproof and then exit the config editor
2007-07-18T08:49:00.000Z	cables	FFForever	turn it on then
2007-07-18T08:50:00.000Z	FFForever	cables	thanks
2007-07-18T08:50:00.000Z	cables	FFForever	not so fast
2007-07-18T08:51:00.000Z	cables	FFForever	once you exit the config editor, hit alt-f2 and type < nautilus -q && nautilus > (yes, there are supposed to be 2 &s)
2007-07-18T08:51:00.000Z	cables	FFForever	when that's done, you can go and burn your CD.
