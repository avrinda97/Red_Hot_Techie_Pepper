2006-10-29T12:03:00.000Z	AlanHaggai		not working Lobster
2006-10-29T12:03:00.000Z	AlanHaggai		Lobster : how is it done?
2006-10-29T12:04:00.000Z	rbil	AlanHaggai	open a terminal, get the PID for the process and kill it
2006-10-29T12:04:00.000Z	AlanHaggai		ok
2006-10-29T12:04:00.000Z	rbil	AlanHaggai	what app you trying to kill?
2006-10-29T12:04:00.000Z	AlanHaggai		gnokii
2006-10-29T12:04:00.000Z	AlanHaggai	rbil	: gnokii
2006-10-29T12:05:00.000Z	rbil		not familiar with that one, but anyways, open terminal and :  kill gnokii
2006-10-29T12:05:00.000Z	rbil		if it was started by root, you'll need to: sudo kill gnokii
2006-10-29T12:05:00.000Z	AlanHaggai	rbil	:bash: kill: gnokii: arguments must be process or job IDs
2006-10-29T12:06:00.000Z	rbil	AlanHaggai	 try killall gnokii
2006-10-29T12:06:00.000Z	AlanHaggai		ok rbil
2006-10-29T12:06:00.000Z	rbil	AlanHaggai	 if that doesn't work get the PID # and kill that
2006-10-29T12:07:00.000Z	rbil	AlanHaggai	use top or ps ax to get the PID # to kill of that process
2006-10-29T12:07:00.000Z	AlanHaggai		How to get PID?
2006-10-29T12:07:00.000Z	AlanHaggai		ok rbil
2006-10-29T12:08:00.000Z	AlanHaggai	rbil	:ok done :)
2006-10-29T12:08:00.000Z	rbil		:-)
2006-10-29T12:08:00.000Z	AlanHaggai	rbil	: but can I know if there are any shortcuts keys like in windows Ctrl + Alt + Delete to do the same?
