2006-06-09T16:05:00.000Z	Jemt		Hm, maybe I can do it from the BIOS. That should disable it completely. THanks, rob_p
2006-06-09T07:00:00.000Z	meuserj	Jemt	is this an upgrade or a fresh install?
2006-06-09T07:00:00.000Z	Jemt	meuserj	I can sometimes re-produce the problem when I'm listening to musik from my USB drive while running a VMWare image of Windows XP from the same device
2006-06-09T07:00:00.000Z	Jemt	meuserj	Fresh install
2006-06-09T07:01:00.000Z	meuserj	Jemt	well, there's your answer..... two different OS's accessing the same drive at the same time will always cause problems....
2006-06-09T07:02:00.000Z	Jemt	meuserj	But.. the VMPlayer works like a "wrapper" i would guess
2006-06-09T07:02:00.000Z	Jemt	meuserj	Just like it does for both audio, video, LAN etc.
2006-06-09T07:03:00.000Z	meuserj	Jemt	drives work differently
2006-06-09T07:03:00.000Z	Jemt	meuserj	True
2006-06-09T07:03:00.000Z	Jemt	meuserj	Actually, the only difference on this setup (with Dapper) and the previous one (Breezy) is that I have now added an external USB harddisk. So it might be it causing problems..
2006-06-09T07:04:00.000Z	Jemt	meuserj	But the problem occured yesterday when I was only listening to music from the drive and browsing the net using Firefox
2006-06-09T07:05:00.000Z	meuserj	Jemt	I just remember back when I was playing with VMWare, they warned not to access harddrives with the guest OS while they are mounted by the host os.
2006-06-09T07:05:00.000Z	meuserj	Jemt	each OS assumes that they are the only OS accessing the drive.
2006-06-09T07:06:00.000Z	Jemt	meuserj	Oh, okay. Well, I'll give Dapper a LAST chance :)  - I'll reinstall it, disable all unnecessary hardware, switching to Vesa drivers instead of ATI drivers and so on
2006-06-09T07:07:00.000Z	Jemt	meuserj	Do you know how to make Ubuntu ignore hardware? I have a Cisco based Wireless network card (mini PCI - laptop) which is detected at random. So I just want it to go away completely
2006-06-09T07:08:00.000Z	meuserj	Jemt	what do you mean "detected at random"?
2006-06-09T07:08:00.000Z	Jemt	meuserj	Sometime it shows up (ie 'ifconfig -a'), mostly it dosn't
2006-06-09T07:09:00.000Z	meuserj	Jemt	you should be able to remove it from /etc/network/interfaces
2006-06-09T07:09:00.000Z	Jemt	meuserj	Ok, I didn't think that would be sufficient
2006-06-09T07:10:00.000Z	Jemt	meuserj	Well, I'll give it a try. Thank you so much. Thank God there is people like you - I have been working on this problem for 4 days now
2006-06-09T07:10:00.000Z	meuserj	Jemt	heh, np
