2011-02-27T10:39:00.000Z	ichbinsnicht		or can someone tell me what the error iptables: No chain/target/match by that name. means?
2011-02-27T10:40:00.000Z	soreau	ichbinsnicht	Where do you see that message?
2011-02-27T10:41:00.000Z	ichbinsnicht	soreau	im trying to redirect dns request to the tor dnslistener using this iptables rule: iptables -t nat -D OUTPUT -d remote_dns_ip -p udp --dport 53 -j DNAT --to remote_dns_ip:5353
2011-02-27T10:42:00.000Z	ichbinsnicht	soreau	is there anything wrong with this rule
2011-02-27T10:42:00.000Z	ichbinsnicht		?
2011-02-27T10:43:00.000Z	soreau	ichbinsnicht	I think you need to change the command to suit your needs. Where it says remote_dns_ip, you need to change this and OUTPUT to real values
2011-02-27T10:43:00.000Z	ichbinsnicht	soreau	i sure did that...but i don't wanted to expose the ip adresses here ;)
2011-02-27T10:44:00.000Z	soreau	ichbinsnicht	other than that, not sure. Maybe try ##networking
2011-02-27T10:45:00.000Z	ichbinsnicht	soreau	do you think that this is the solution to redirect dns requests to a different port than 53 or shall i look for another solution?
2011-02-27T10:46:00.000Z	ichbinsnicht	soreau	i mean send....not redirect
2011-02-27T10:47:00.000Z	soreau	ichbinsnicht	It might be right but you probably should use the newly respected command: ip
2011-02-27T10:47:00.000Z	ichbinsnicht	soreau	what command?
2011-02-27T10:48:00.000Z	soreau	ichbinsnicht	ip
2011-02-27T10:48:00.000Z	ichbinsnicht	soreau	i dont understand
2011-02-27T10:49:00.000Z	ichbinsnicht	soreau	what do you mean?
2011-02-27T10:49:00.000Z	soreau	ichbinsnicht	There is a command called ip that can do what you want. See the manual with this command: man ip
2011-02-27T10:51:00.000Z	ichbinsnicht	soreau	ok...do you maybe know a site where this is explained with examples?
2011-02-27T10:53:00.000Z	soreau	ichbinsnicht	http://linux.die.net/man/8/ip
2011-02-27T10:57:00.000Z	ichbinsnicht	soreau	this is the manual...but i would need an example to understand how this works
2011-02-27T10:58:00.000Z	soreau	ichbinsnicht	ask in ##networking and explain your setup and what you want to do
2011-02-27T10:59:00.000Z	ichbinsnicht	soreau	ok, thx
