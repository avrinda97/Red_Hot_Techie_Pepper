2011-11-27T07:49:00.000Z	Macer		screw this
2011-11-27T07:49:00.000Z	Macer		i bet windows 7 goes to sleep properly
2011-11-27T07:49:00.000Z	Macer		reasons like this are why linux will never be mainstream in comparison to closed operating systems
2011-11-27T07:50:00.000Z	Macer		it is a desktop
2011-11-27T07:50:00.000Z	Macer		tan s2881
2011-11-27T07:50:00.000Z	Macer		tyan
2011-11-27T07:50:00.000Z	Macer		fail.
2011-11-27T07:50:00.000Z	naptastic	Macer	The computer I'm on right now is the only computer I've ever had for which Linux suspend has ever worked, and it's only some of the time.
2011-11-27T07:51:00.000Z	Macer		even shutting down the system causes a reboot
2011-11-27T07:51:00.000Z	Macer		SHUTTING DOWN
2011-11-27T07:51:00.000Z	Macer		ie: turn off
2011-11-27T07:51:00.000Z	Macer		:)
2011-11-27T07:51:00.000Z	naptastic	Macer	What kind of machine (specifically, what motherboard) is this?
2011-11-27T07:52:00.000Z	Macer		tyan s2881
2011-11-27T07:52:00.000Z	naptastic		Sorry; I see you said that already
2011-11-27T07:53:00.000Z	naptastic	Macer	that's a sweet motherboard!! The typical use case for such a sytem probably doesn't include turning it off or suspending though.
2011-11-27T07:53:00.000Z	Macer		honestly. never mind. i honestly dont have time to fiddle with something that has been beoken in linux for years ;) i will just put windows on it. it is a shame because i really love kubuntu
2011-11-27T07:53:00.000Z	Macer		but i need the suspend to work
2011-11-27T07:55:00.000Z	Macer	melkor	well.. that is even more of a pain. especially if i am forced to build one
2011-11-27T07:55:00.000Z	Macer		and not even know if it will work
2011-11-27T07:55:00.000Z	naptastic	Macer	well I'mma leave right now to go play TF2... on Windows. So take all this with some salt. ;-)
