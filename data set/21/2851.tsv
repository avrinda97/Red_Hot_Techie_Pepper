2009-06-17T05:22:00.000Z	mrwes		Can I use Remote Desktop Viewer to connect to my Remote Desktop at work -- running MS Server Remote Desktop?
2009-06-17T05:23:00.000Z	cabrey	mrwes	use terminal server client
2009-06-17T05:23:00.000Z	mrwes	cabrey	hrmm...ok lemme try that
2009-06-17T05:24:00.000Z	mrwes	cabrey	I'm getting and error, Name or Service Not Known
2009-06-17T05:25:00.000Z	cabrey	mrwes	use the FQDN
2009-06-17T05:25:00.000Z	mrwes	cabrey	for the protocol you mean?
2009-06-17T05:26:00.000Z	cabrey	mrwes	in the client use the fqdn in the server field b/c ubuntu doesnt use netbios AFAIK
2009-06-17T05:27:00.000Z	mrwes	cabrey	hrmm...shrug...I'm friggin' lost..er
2009-06-17T05:28:00.000Z	cabrey	mrwes	i would install grdc, it is much better than the built in terminal server client anyway
2009-06-17T05:34:00.000Z	mrwes	cabrey	Ok...I got to the server, but it seems I don't have terminal service rights, but I have remote rights....
2009-06-17T05:35:00.000Z	cabrey	mrwes	that is a server side/AD issue, you have to be in the remote desktop users group
2009-06-17T05:35:00.000Z	mrwes	cabrey	I am, cuz I can remote desktop in from a windows machine
2009-06-17T05:36:00.000Z	mrwes	cabrey	what is FQDN ?
2009-06-17T05:36:00.000Z	cabrey	mrwes	fully qualified domain name
2009-06-17T05:36:00.000Z	cabrey	mrwes	for ex: tsserver1.eastco.department.company.com
2009-06-17T05:37:00.000Z	mrwes	cabrey	ok
2009-06-17T05:39:00.000Z	mrwes	cabrey	guess I'll have to speak with the IT guys in the morning, to add me to that group.
2009-06-17T05:39:00.000Z	cabrey	mrwes	yea ask, and it might be that you're not allowed to access the terminal server from outside the company network
2009-06-17T05:41:00.000Z	mrwes	cabrey	gotta be, but it's a weird setup, because I'm in the remote desktop group for use. I emailed them a screenshot of the error -- thanks for the help
2009-06-17T05:41:00.000Z	cabrey	mrwes	hopefully they won't be jerks and say you're using ubuntu :/
2009-06-17T05:42:00.000Z	mrwes	cabrey	nah...they know I run Ubuntu :)
