2008-04-02T15:50:00.000Z	murlidhar	ai3gtmc	ok when u install windows xp . that hard disk will be recognized as hd0.
2008-04-02T15:51:00.000Z	ai3gtmc	murlidhar	what will happen to grub? will grub add windows?
2008-04-02T15:51:00.000Z	murlidhar	ai3gtmc	grub will have to be manually installed using livecd.
2008-04-02T15:51:00.000Z	murlidhar	ai3gtmc	which forturnately is easy
2008-04-02T15:52:00.000Z	ai3gtmc	murlidhar	so that means windows will destroy grub?
2008-04-02T15:52:00.000Z	murlidhar	ai3gtmc	most probably yes
2008-04-02T15:53:00.000Z	ai3gtmc	murlidhar	oh k.. so imma install xp now.. bbl thanks
