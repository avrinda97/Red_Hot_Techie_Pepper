2012-01-12T20:58:00.000Z	martian	rabbi1	that doesn't really have anything to do with ubuntu
2012-01-12T20:58:00.000Z	rabbi1	martian	i search for firefox channel, any suggestion ?
2012-01-12T20:59:00.000Z	martian	rabbi1	https://addons.mozilla.org/
2012-01-12T20:59:00.000Z	rabbi1	martian	i am on the same page....
2012-02-22T21:44:00.000Z	martian	rabbi1	try (in a terminal): zip FF yourfile.zip
2012-02-22T21:46:00.000Z	rabbi1	martian	what does it do ?
2012-02-22T21:46:00.000Z	martian	rabbi1	attempts to fix the archive
2012-02-22T21:46:00.000Z	rabbi1	martian	nope, it just zipped the .zip file
2012-02-22T21:48:00.000Z	martian	rabbi1	sorry, try: zip -FF --out fixed.zip yourzip.zip
2012-02-22T21:49:00.000Z	rabbi1	martian	 zip warning: Missing end (EOCDR) signature - either this archive is not readable or the end is damaged
2012-02-22T21:50:00.000Z	martian	rabbi1	are you sure it's a zip? try running "file yourzip.zip" and see what it says
2012-02-22T21:51:00.000Z	martian	rabbi1	then yep, it's dead :(
2012-02-22T21:51:00.000Z	rabbi1	martian	from the -FF command i am able to see the data inside .zip file. but not extract
2012-02-22T21:52:00.000Z	martian	rabbi1	that probably means the header of the archive is intact, so zip is still able to see what is supposed to be in it, but the data is probably all garbled
2012-02-22T21:55:00.000Z	rabbi1	martian	nope, i was able to extract files one by one, mainfile.zip had 8 other .zip files but i was able to unzip 7 out of 8 one by one. the corrupted .zip file was the last one. ....
2012-02-22T21:55:00.000Z	rabbi1	martian	thanks a lot ...!
2012-02-22T21:55:00.000Z	martian	rabbi1	rad!
