2009-03-28T08:21:00.000Z	bullgard4		What is the effect of the keyboard shortcut Alt+F7 in X (Or should I say 'X')?
2009-03-28T08:21:00.000Z	gigabites2	bullgard4	ctrl+alt+f7 switches to tty7
2009-03-28T08:22:00.000Z	bullgard4	gigabites2	I am not speaking about Ctrl+Alt+F7. Rather, about Alt+F7.
2009-03-28T08:23:00.000Z	gigabites2	bullgard4	It depends on your window manager
2009-03-28T08:24:00.000Z	bullgard4	gigabites2	What depends on my window manager?
2009-03-28T08:24:00.000Z	gigabites2	bullgard4	the function of alt+f7
2009-03-28T08:24:00.000Z	bullgard4	gigabites2	Ah!
2009-03-28T08:25:00.000Z	gigabites2	bullgard4	You can map it to do basically whatever you want
2009-03-28T08:31:00.000Z	gigabites2	bullgard4	Ubuntu?
2009-03-28T08:26:00.000Z	bullgard4	gigabites2	Well, this may be true. But firstly I am interested in knowing what the effect is in the default Ubuntu 8.04.2 installation.
2009-03-28T08:26:00.000Z	gigabites2	bullgard4	Try it. I don't think it's mapped by default
2009-03-28T08:28:00.000Z	bullgard4	gigabites2	Your recipe is not practical. To test every single bit in a computer oneself one would need more than a lifespan. Thus theories have been created. Theories are very practical. Not so your advice.
2009-03-28T08:28:00.000Z	gigabites2	bullgard4	Ok, the keyboard shortcuts tells you what each & every combination does
2009-03-28T08:29:00.000Z	gigabites2	bullgard4	system->preferences->keyboard settings
2009-03-28T08:30:00.000Z	bullgard4	gigabites2	There is no  system->preferences->keyboard settings
2009-03-28T08:31:00.000Z	gigabites2	bullgard4	With GNOME running?
2009-03-28T08:32:00.000Z	bullgard4	gigabites2	Ubuntu 8.04.2
2009-03-28T08:32:00.000Z	gigabites2	bullgard4	System->Preferences->Keyboard Shortcuts
2009-03-28T08:33:00.000Z	bullgard4	gigabites2	Ah! I found it. Thank you very much for your help.
2009-03-28T08:34:00.000Z	gigabites2	bullgard4	Certainly. :)
2009-03-28T08:47:00.000Z	bullgard4	gigabites2	Do the keyboard shortcuts listed in System > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts > (Keyboard Shortcuts) > Action apply to all GNOME or to MetaCity or what program did implement them?
