2006-08-28T11:33:00.000Z	RMorris84		my xserver keeps crashin when i tried to install glx/compriz
2006-08-28T11:33:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	RMorris84	ask in #ubuntu-xgl
2006-08-28T11:38:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	RMorris84	hate to tell you this, but xgl is experimental software, so you should expect things to go wrong. Just undo your steps to restore your system.
2006-08-28T11:39:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	RMorris84	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2006-08-28T11:39:00.000Z	RMorris84	fyrestrtr	i did that... but it still does the same thing, i can tell u the error i get when it does boot up though
2006-08-28T11:42:00.000Z	RMorris84	fyrestrtr	or anyone, it says GDM: Xserver not found: /usr/bin/Xgl ... then says Command could not be executed! please install the x server or correct GDM configure and restart GDM

2006-08-28T12:15:00.000Z	RMorris84	fyrestrtr	http://www.compiz.net/topic-652-compiz-ubuntu-gnome-with-nvidia
2006-08-28T12:16:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	RMorris84	remove your changes from /etc/gdm/gdm.conf-custom
2006-08-28T12:17:00.000Z	RMorris84	fyrestrtr	1.2. Configure Xorg
2006-08-28T12:25:00.000Z	RMorris84	fyrestrtr	if i put a live cd an i redo my installation?
2006-08-28T12:25:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	RMorris84	if by 'redo' you mean format, and reinstall from scratch, then yes.
2006-08-28T13:44:00.000Z	RMorris84	fyrestrtr	is there a way i can see what nic are installed and their name, like wlan0 or eth1 etc
2006-08-28T13:44:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	RMorris84	ifconfig -a
2006-08-30T07:02:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	RMorris84	are you using nvidia's drivers?
2006-08-30T07:02:00.000Z	RMorris84	fyrestrtr	intel i810 driver
2006-08-30T07:03:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	RMorris84	you should use aiglx
2006-08-30T07:28:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	RMorris84	not quite. First, you mount your new drive. Then, as root copy the contents of /home to the new drive (use cp -a to preserve permissions). Then, edit /etc/fstab to make sure the new drive is mounted under /home -- finally, restart the machine (or, umount /home and then mount /home again)
