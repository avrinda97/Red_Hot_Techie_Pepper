2006-09-16T05:15:00.000Z	Tonren		How do I mount a FAT16 volume so that I have permission to read & write to it without sudoing, like GNOME does automatically?
2006-09-16T05:17:00.000Z	Tonren		Crap.. how do I retrieve a file recently deleted with rm?
2006-09-16T05:19:00.000Z	Tonren		Come on guys... any way to get back a file removed with rm?
2006-09-16T05:20:00.000Z	eyequeue	Tonren	^^
2006-09-16T05:20:00.000Z	Tonren	eyequeue	Is that a package...?  a man page?  I can't get to either
2006-09-16T05:22:00.000Z	eyequeue	Tonren	i'm trying to determine how it got on my system
2006-09-16T05:23:00.000Z	Tonren	eyequeue	wait crap... not FAT16... i meant... i meant ext3.  god this sucks
2006-09-16T05:23:00.000Z	Tonren	eyequeue	I'm trying recover
2006-11-04T14:59:00.000Z	eyequeue	Tonren	that's normal, but if you want, i can tell you how to get those back
2006-11-04T15:00:00.000Z	Tonren	eyequeue	To get them back, do I remove the "quiet" option in GRUB like BAzfH said?
2006-11-04T15:01:00.000Z	eyequeue	Tonren	yes, then sudo update-grub afterward
2006-11-04T15:01:00.000Z	Tonren	eyequeue	Alternately, I'd love to be able to specify, in interfaces, to not bother configuring if there's nothing plugged into the ethernet port.
2006-11-04T15:02:00.000Z	Tonren	eyequeue	BAzfH: Frankly, I think it's ridiculous that Ubuntu still has that behavior.  I was thinking of disabling it on boot entirely, and having it run on Gnome startup.
2006-11-04T15:02:00.000Z	eyequeue	Tonren	you do or don't want the boot messages?  some like quiet as default, i want as much info as possible, heh
2006-11-04T15:03:00.000Z	Tonren	eyequeue	The only reason I want the boot messages is so I can Ctrl + C out of "Configuring network interfaces..." because it hangs when I'm not plugged in.
2006-11-04T15:03:00.000Z	Tonren	eyequeue	If I can somehow specify, in /etc/networking/interfaces, to not bother with configuring if there's nothing plugged in, I'd rather do that.
2006-11-04T15:03:00.000Z	eyequeue	Tonren	ah, put the quiet back in once you find a real fix.  i had to run nosplash for a while until edgy got fixed
2006-11-04T15:04:00.000Z	Tonren	eyequeue	Where is GRUB's rc?
2006-11-04T15:04:00.000Z	eyequeue	Tonren	/boot/grub/menu.list is probably what you want
2006-11-04T15:05:00.000Z	Tonren	eyequeue	Oh, god.  The system terminal font is now horribly anti-aliased.  What's a good alternative?
2006-11-04T15:05:00.000Z	eyequeue	Tonren	not sure, i'm not a font guy
