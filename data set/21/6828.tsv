2011-03-01T00:13:00.000Z	agnostic		While trying installing acroread, i got following error-report (It's in german, but should be easy to understand) acroread:
2011-03-01T00:13:00.000Z	agnostic		 Hängt ab: libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0 (>=2.21.6) but it is not installable
2011-03-01T00:13:00.000Z	agnostic		  Hängt ab: libssl0.9.8 (>=0.9.8m-1), aber es wird 0.9.8k-7ubuntu8.6 installiert
2011-03-01T00:13:00.000Z	agnostic		*Hängt ab =  depends
2011-03-01T00:13:00.000Z	agnostic		But i can not install the other packages either.
2011-03-01T00:15:00.000Z	jrib	agnostic	that's usually because repositories for different version of ubuntu are being/were mixed
2011-03-01T00:16:00.000Z	agnostic	jrib	Is "maverick" a distribution? Then may i found the bug, because it's called like this in the software-source.
2011-03-01T00:17:00.000Z	jrib	agnostic	hmm?
2011-03-01T00:17:00.000Z	jrib	agnostic	where are you getting acroread from?
2011-03-01T00:17:00.000Z	agnostic	jrib	If i have distribution "maverik" named for the package-source, it wont work for lucid, i think.
2011-03-01T00:18:00.000Z	agnostic	jrib	from synapic.
2011-03-01T00:18:00.000Z	jrib	agnostic	pastebin « apt-cache policy acroread »
2011-03-01T00:18:00.000Z	agnostic	jrib	Should i type this in?
2011-03-01T00:19:00.000Z	jrib	agnostic	a terminal
2011-03-01T00:22:00.000Z	agnostic	jrib	Thanks, it worked. Something I also should know for the future :-)
2011-03-01T00:22:00.000Z	jrib	agnostic	that command only gives information, it doesn't do anything
2011-03-01T00:22:00.000Z	agnostic	jrib	I mean with the mixed package-source. It will always use the newest, right?
2011-03-01T00:23:00.000Z	jrib	agnostic	no, you should use the one for your version of ubuntu
2011-03-01T00:23:00.000Z	agnostic	jrib	exactly ;-)
2011-03-01T00:23:00.000Z	agnostic	jrib	But you told me that before.
2011-03-01T00:23:00.000Z	jrib	agnostic	ok
