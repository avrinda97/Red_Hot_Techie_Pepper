2010-01-17T21:07:00.000Z	Linuxnoob		i got probs booting my ubuntu 9.10 live CD
2010-01-17T21:07:00.000Z	{chmod}755	Linuxnoob	do you have Linux installed on your system?
2010-01-17T21:08:00.000Z	{chmod}755	Linuxnoob	you do know that the file you downloaded is an ISO and it needs to be mounted on a CD
2010-01-17T21:09:00.000Z	{chmod}755	Linuxnoob	In other words, you did not just burn it to the CD like a regular data disc. You DID mount the image on the disc?
2010-01-17T21:09:00.000Z	{chmod}755	Linuxnoob	So when you boot you see a screen that asks you to choose your Windows partition or your Ubuntu partition?
2010-01-17T21:10:00.000Z	{chmod}755	Linuxnoob	Thank you very much. =)
2010-01-17T21:14:00.000Z	{chmod}755	Linuxnoob	That's the issue! You're using daemontools to mount the disc.
2010-01-17T21:15:00.000Z	{chmod}755	Linuxnoob	no - just burn the CD correctly. Give me a second? I'll send you a link...
2010-01-17T21:16:00.000Z	{chmod}755	Linuxnoob	http://pcsupport.about.com/od/toolsofthetrade/ht/burnisofile.htm - follow the directions here to burn your ISO to disc.
2010-01-17T21:17:00.000Z	{chmod}755	Linuxnoob	I don't use Nero so I don't know.
2010-01-17T21:19:00.000Z	{chmod}755	Linuxnoob	shoot bud
2010-01-17T21:19:00.000Z	{chmod}755	Linuxnoob	don't need to worry about that.
2010-01-17T21:20:00.000Z	{chmod}755	Linuxnoob	viruses are virtually nonexistant for Linux. Further, you don't need to concern yourself with disc defragmentation as well.
2010-01-17T21:23:00.000Z	{chmod}755	Linuxnoob	This is a good question. Some games have linux versions on their discs, like Neverwinter Nights (big fan) and installing is easy.
2010-01-17T21:23:00.000Z	{chmod}755	Linuxnoob	others will require Wine and some won't work at all. However, the Linux community has a HUGE collection of free games for you.
2010-01-17T21:25:00.000Z	{chmod}755	Linuxnoob	Yeah, a lot of games have linux versions. And you will need to redl WoW in Linux format.
2010-01-17T21:25:00.000Z	{chmod}755	Linuxnoob	.exe files do not work in Linux (unless you use some... cheats)
2010-01-17T21:26:00.000Z	{chmod}755	Linuxnoob	Wine or shell commands to convert formats. (I've seen it done!)
2010-01-17T21:29:00.000Z	{chmod}755	Linuxnoob	in general.
2010-01-17T21:30:00.000Z	{chmod}755	Linuxnoob	9.10
