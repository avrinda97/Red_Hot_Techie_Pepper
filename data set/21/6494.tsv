2007-11-23T19:59:00.000Z	nfusco		Does feisty have the restricted drivers option for the broadcom chipset?
2007-11-23T19:59:00.000Z	kazol	nfusco	Yes, but they have terrible performance.
2007-11-23T19:59:00.000Z	kazol	nfusco	Use ndiswrapper instead.
2007-11-23T19:59:00.000Z	nfusco	kazol	Why do you say that? due to speed?
2007-11-23T20:00:00.000Z	kazol	nfusco	I got 60kB maximum and high latency. Using ndiswrapper, I got the full speed.
2007-11-23T20:00:00.000Z	kazol	nfusco	And it worked only part of the time (even though the WAP was right above the office).
2007-11-23T20:00:00.000Z	nfusco	kazol	Well this is the issue I have.. https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.22/+bug/124159
2007-11-23T20:00:00.000Z	nfusco	kazol	What card you have?
2007-11-23T20:01:00.000Z	kazol	nfusco	BCM4306
2007-11-23T20:01:00.000Z	nfusco	kazol	Same here..it seems there is an issue in the gutsy kernel, apparently on feisty its ok, what you running currently?
2007-11-23T20:03:00.000Z	nfusco	kazol	I have tried getting NDis working on gutsy with my card, I had no joy, Im static IP with WEP
2007-11-23T20:04:00.000Z	kazol	nfusco	Why didn't it work?
2007-11-23T20:05:00.000Z	nfusco	kazol	To be honest,I dont know i followed numerous howtos on the forums, and I just couldnt get it running, Im no seasoned linux guru.. so im kinda ata  loss
2007-11-23T20:09:00.000Z	nfusco	kazol	Did you experience any issues with Ndis?
2007-11-23T20:10:00.000Z	kazol	nfusco	At the very beginning I didn't use it correctly (had to copy all files, not just .inf), but after that, it worked perfectly.
2007-11-23T20:12:00.000Z	nfusco	kazol	What are you currently running?
2007-11-23T20:12:00.000Z	nfusco	kazol	gutsy or feisty?
2007-11-23T20:12:00.000Z	kazol	nfusco	Ubuntu Gutsy
2007-11-23T20:13:00.000Z	nfusco	kazol	from what it says in Launchpad, I may roll back to feisty until this is sorted in gutsy
2007-11-23T20:14:00.000Z	kazol	nfusco	So it's a bug with ndiswrapper?
2007-11-23T20:16:00.000Z	nfusco	kazol	no gutsy kernel
