2008-02-11T20:21:00.000Z	_Oz_		...  by typing sudo updatedb
2008-02-11T20:21:00.000Z	_Oz_		?
2008-02-11T20:22:00.000Z	_Oz_		done
2008-02-11T20:22:00.000Z	_Oz_		now what
2008-02-11T20:23:00.000Z	_Oz_		which packages should I look for in synaptic?
2008-02-11T20:24:00.000Z	_Oz_		ok.
2008-02-11T20:24:00.000Z	_Oz_		I see why automatix was created, I gues.
2008-02-11T20:24:00.000Z	_Oz_		for the slightly stupider user like me.
2008-02-11T20:24:00.000Z	_Oz_		I just wanted all those nice apps installed like automatix did but I was led to believe medibuntu did that just as well.
2008-02-11T20:24:00.000Z	PriceChild	_Oz_	they will be installed when you try to play them.
2008-02-12T03:55:00.000Z	PriceChild	_Oz_	the first is possible otb
2008-02-12T03:56:00.000Z	PriceChild	_Oz_	I guess you could ssh in or vnc or something.
2008-02-12T03:58:00.000Z	PriceChild	_Oz_	not you could share it across samba
2008-02-12T03:58:00.000Z	PriceChild	_Oz_	of nfs
2008-03-04T11:05:00.000Z	PriceChild	_Oz_	pardon?
2008-03-04T11:05:00.000Z	_Oz_	PriceChild	every wireless card I've combined ubuntu with has choked unfortunately. :(
2008-03-04T11:06:00.000Z	PriceChild	_Oz_	that does not mean they don't work for anyone else.
2008-03-04T11:06:00.000Z	_Oz_	PriceChild	no, but it is sort of a known weakness of ubuntu at this point in time -- especially if it's a laptop.
2008-03-04T11:06:00.000Z	PriceChild	_Oz_	I would suggest instead you find out the chipset and give helpful advice.
2008-03-04T11:07:00.000Z	_Oz_	PriceChild	I'm just letting him know it's a common problem, that's all.
