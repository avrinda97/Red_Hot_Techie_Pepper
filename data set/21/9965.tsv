2005-11-03T15:32:00.000Z	prasys	Merturk	: it depends..soemtimes you need to get the driver
2005-11-03T15:32:00.000Z	prasys		and compile the sound driver back into the kernel
2005-11-03T15:32:00.000Z	prasys		a simple google search will tell you or give you an idea what to do
2005-11-03T15:32:00.000Z	Merturk		the only driver I've found is for the windows platform
2005-11-03T15:33:00.000Z	prasys	Merturk	: type this your soundcard chipset and linux in google
2005-11-03T15:33:00.000Z	prasys		to see if its supported or not
2005-11-03T15:34:00.000Z	Merturk	bob2	it's a laptop
