2005-09-05T06:46:00.000Z	DjKritical		Can I mount a bin file the same way that I would mount an iso file?
2005-09-05T06:47:00.000Z	bob2	DjKritical	no, convert it to a useful format with bchunk
2005-09-12T16:38:00.000Z	bob2	DjKritical	depends what you want it to do
2005-09-12T16:38:00.000Z	DjKritical	bob2	simple IRC client with no gui
2005-09-12T16:39:00.000Z	DjKritical	bob2	it would react to commands through IRC.. mainly for administrative purposes
2005-09-12T16:41:00.000Z	DjKritical	bob2	not a service in the windows sense... but a service such as it doesn't take input from a user on the windows machine... it takes input through the IRC connection...
2005-09-12T16:42:00.000Z	bob2	DjKritical	then that will be fairly simple
2005-09-12T16:42:00.000Z	bob2	DjKritical	except windows has it's own crackpot sockets stuff
2005-09-12T16:42:00.000Z	bob2	DjKritical	I'd try using CommonC++ to abstract it away
2005-09-25T08:34:00.000Z	bob2	DjKritical	you're experiencing problems with ubuntu's pre-packaged nvidia drivers today?
2005-09-25T08:34:00.000Z	DjKritical	bob2	no like 2 weeks ago
2005-09-25T08:35:00.000Z	bob2	DjKritical	so, that seems entirely unrelated to any issues kevin007 might be having
2005-09-25T08:35:00.000Z	DjKritical	bob2	that was regarding jassids issuesm not kevin007
2005-10-18T11:36:00.000Z	bob2	DjKritical	#cedega
2005-10-18T11:36:00.000Z	DjKritical	bob2	#cedega doesn't suppose cvscedega
2005-10-18T11:36:00.000Z	bob2	DjKritical	how are we supposed to support random uncared for software from CVS?
2005-10-18T11:37:00.000Z	bob2	DjKritical	if the only people allowed to fix it won't listen to problems, what can anyone else do?
2005-10-18T11:37:00.000Z	DjKritical	bob2	I'm trying to install it.. all I need to know is what packages I need.. thats why I need someone who has done it before
2005-10-30T06:58:00.000Z	bob2	DjKritical	"convert" from imagemagick
2005-10-31T13:50:00.000Z	bob2	DjKritical	yes
2005-11-05T17:23:00.000Z	bob2	DjKritical	bchunk can make an iso out of them, if they're data
