2011-10-12T18:05:00.000Z	iDorito		Yeah. Like, I keep hearing about release cycles, stable vs. unstable releases, LTS (I know what it stands for), etc. etc.
2011-10-12T18:05:00.000Z	iDorito		I don't understand the context/significance of these things. It's confusing me.
2011-10-12T18:05:00.000Z	iDorito		Where can I find out more?
2011-10-12T18:06:00.000Z	iDorito		Basically, where can I learn more about how Ubuntu is developed and why it's based on Debian?
2011-10-12T18:06:00.000Z	iDorito		And the logic behind the development choices.
2011-10-12T18:07:00.000Z	iDorito		Hahaha.
2011-10-12T18:08:00.000Z	iDorito		I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around the purpose of these.
2011-10-12T18:09:00.000Z	iDorito		I don't really get what it is.
2011-10-12T18:11:00.000Z	iDorito		Thanks for the response.
2011-10-12T18:12:00.000Z	iDorito		My question is what exactly does "supported" mean in this context?
2011-10-12T18:12:00.000Z	sagaci	iDorito	you get updates
2011-10-12T18:12:00.000Z	sagaci	iDorito	software updates, yes and people in here will help you
2011-10-12T18:13:00.000Z	sagaci	iDorito	regular version 6 months
2011-10-12T18:13:00.000Z	sagaci	iDorito	every 4th release is an LTS
2011-10-12T18:14:00.000Z	sagaci	iDorito	correct
2011-10-12T18:15:00.000Z	sagaci	iDorito	most of third party is "supported" by the community
2011-10-12T18:17:00.000Z	sagaci	iDorito	they go End of Life
2011-10-12T18:17:00.000Z	sagaci	iDorito	you can still technically use them but you won't get updates
2011-10-12T18:18:00.000Z	sagaci	iDorito	you can upgrade or clean install
2011-10-12T18:26:00.000Z	sagaci	iDorito	the closest you'd get to rolling release is by using the dev releases, which isn't really recommended unless you have a spare system that you don't rely on
2011-10-12T18:31:00.000Z	sagaci	iDorito	it's not that bad having a slightly out-of-date solitaire game
