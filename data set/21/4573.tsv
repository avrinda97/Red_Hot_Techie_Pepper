2008-04-16T04:38:00.000Z	Mr_Bad_News		i've been reading around and i keep finding posts that say vmware no longer works on gutsy
2008-04-16T04:39:00.000Z	Mr_Bad_News		i just need to get a windows machine running so i can use rosetta stone
2008-04-16T04:39:00.000Z	Mr_Bad_News		unless there's a better way
2008-04-16T04:39:00.000Z	Mr_Bad_News		wine doesnt really work that well
2008-04-16T04:39:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Mr_Bad_News	 theres always virtualbox
2008-04-16T04:39:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Mr_Bad_News	 yes. :)  yet another virtual machine program. similer to vmware. You could ask in #ubuntu+1 if vmware is working
2008-04-16T04:40:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Mr_Bad_News	 depends on your needs. Both are getting better all the time.
2008-04-16T04:40:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Mr_Bad_News	 given that its free... theres no reason to not try it out.
2008-04-16T04:40:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Mr_Bad_News	 'rosetta stone' means nothing to me. :)
2008-04-16T04:41:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Mr_Bad_News	 my linux laptop only has 30gb total of hd space.
2008-04-16T04:41:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Mr_Bad_News	 i have a 10gb or so windows install on it.
2008-04-16T04:47:00.000Z	Mr_Bad_News	Dr_willis	how do i run virtualbox
2008-04-16T04:47:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Mr_Bad_News	 i would have to suggest reading the docs at their web page.   Its rather straight forward.
2008-04-16T06:05:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Mr_Bad_News	 that some how makes it 'enough'?
2008-04-16T06:07:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Mr_Bad_News	 i tend to use 'xset b 0 0 0 '
2008-04-16T06:07:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Mr_Bad_News	 time to learn some basic shell commands then.
2008-04-16T06:09:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Mr_Bad_News	 if you really want to use mininimal ram, You may want to install a very veyr very light window manager like jwm,
2008-04-16T06:11:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Mr_Bad_News	 The Orieally book on Using Bash - is a must get. :) At one time i had a book by redhat that was basicially a printout of all the man pages.  Not sure if those are still  being printed or not.
