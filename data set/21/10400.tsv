2005-03-23T06:36:00.000Z	blizah		i accidentally deleted the system tray in gnome anyone know how to go about getting in back?
2005-03-23T06:36:00.000Z	crimsun	blizah	add it via second-click on the menu bar
2005-04-17T13:08:00.000Z	crimsun	blizah	Friday
2005-04-20T06:54:00.000Z	crimsun	blizah	if you don't need it, sure
2005-04-21T15:59:00.000Z	crimsun	blizah	sure. Set it to at least release the device after an idle period.
2005-04-22T16:00:00.000Z	blizah	crimsun	what does that entail?
2005-04-22T16:01:00.000Z	crimsun	blizah	read the man page for esd
2005-04-22T16:14:00.000Z	blizah	crimsun	sry to keep prying but cant find much useful on ubuntu on about alsa, oss and esd besides what i know...
2005-04-22T16:15:00.000Z	crimsun	blizah	ok, what are you attempting to do?
2005-04-22T16:15:00.000Z	blizah	crimsun	well ive noticed you cant run things in oss or alsa without killing esd...any way to get around that?
2005-04-22T16:15:00.000Z	blizah	crimsun	have them all (3) working as one big happy family :D
2005-04-22T16:16:00.000Z	crimsun	blizah	personally I use polypaudio, but most of its functionality can be made to work in esd.
2005-04-22T16:17:00.000Z	blizah	crimsun	have to check with alsa and oss to see if they can work w/ esd?
2005-04-22T16:23:00.000Z	blizah	crimsun	does pollyaudio work with alsa and oss?...cause im using cedega and it only uses win and oss i believe
2005-04-22T16:24:00.000Z	crimsun	blizah	it's configured to use alsa's oss emulation, just as esd is configured to do
2005-04-22T16:25:00.000Z	blizah	crimsun	than why do you have to change xmms to output to esd if you want to play mp3s?..as opposed to alsa or oss
2005-04-22T16:26:00.000Z	crimsun	blizah	because on a default install, esd runs, so you can't use oss (esd has the device) or alsa (esd has the oss emulation device)
2005-04-22T16:30:00.000Z	blizah	crimsun	sorry for all the questions. but is there a way to get oss and alsa to play in ubuntu w/ out killing esd?
2005-04-22T16:30:00.000Z	crimsun	blizah	the default /etc/esound/esd.conf should do that.
2005-04-22T16:30:00.000Z	crimsun	blizah	just make sure you wait 5 seconds.
2005-04-22T16:31:00.000Z	blizah	crimsun	hrm k ill go try once more
