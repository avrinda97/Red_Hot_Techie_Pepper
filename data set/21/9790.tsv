2005-07-10T15:56:00.000Z	iluciv		I'm using 2.6.12.2
2005-07-10T15:57:00.000Z	warrior_	iluciv	did you make your kernel yourself for ubuntu?
2005-07-10T15:59:00.000Z	warrior_	iluciv	are you using gnome 2.10 with it?
2005-07-10T16:01:00.000Z	iluciv	warrior_	what happens
2005-07-10T16:01:00.000Z	warrior_	iluciv	you mean with the kernel?
2005-07-10T16:02:00.000Z	iluciv	warrior_	sorry I still don't understand view it with the kernel??
2005-07-10T16:03:00.000Z	warrior_	iluciv	I can't get 2.6.11 to work with gnome.  never has, but it should be stable as I used it with another os
2005-07-10T16:05:00.000Z	warrior_	iluciv	unfortunately I have an ati card
2005-07-10T16:06:00.000Z	iluciv	warrior_	Its a great howto
2005-07-10T16:09:00.000Z	warrior_	iluciv	I've read through that.  Sounded good but my only problem was making sure I got all my settings correct.  Is there a guide for choosing the right modules and all?
2005-07-10T16:11:00.000Z	iluciv	warrior_	thats the part where copy over your old config make oldconfig
2005-07-10T16:12:00.000Z	warrior_	iluciv	this could be easier than I thought.  Biggest question, do you have working 3d acceleration and linux headers to match 2.6.12-2?
2005-07-10T16:14:00.000Z	iluciv	warrior_	I've posted in that thread near the end and gone through what I did like a newbie (cause I am one)
2005-07-10T16:14:00.000Z	warrior_	iluciv	as am I
2005-07-10T16:18:00.000Z	warrior_	iluciv	yea I'm gonna avoid 2.6.12 and try to go with 2.6.11 and use fglrx 8.14.13
2005-07-10T16:20:00.000Z	warrior_	iluciv	this is what I get for wanting to be faster on a perfectly good system.  bbl if all goes well and thanks for the thread reference
