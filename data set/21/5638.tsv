2007-12-10T00:01:00.000Z	ActySofts	ikonia	on what topic exactly?
2007-12-10T00:01:00.000Z	ikonia	ActySofts	"bash scripts won't work"
2007-12-10T00:01:00.000Z	ikonia	ActySofts	please expand on "won't work"
2007-12-10T00:03:00.000Z	ActySofts	ikonia	they didn't run at all, but nickrud pointed out to me that I needed to chmod 'em
2007-12-10T00:03:00.000Z	ikonia	ActySofts	for future reference you need to give more info than "they don't run at all"
2007-12-10T00:04:00.000Z	ActySofts	ikonia	well...they didn't run at all, so what more info could I have given?
2007-12-10T00:05:00.000Z	ikonia	ActySofts	I execute them, I get no output, or I get an error, or script one works, but script 2 doesn't, I'm running as X user, with Y location etc
2007-12-10T00:05:00.000Z	ActySofts	ikonia	OK, I said some I got "Permission Denied"
2007-12-10T00:06:00.000Z	ikonia	ActySofts	I missed that
