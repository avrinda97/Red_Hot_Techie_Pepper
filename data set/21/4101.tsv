2008-08-10T04:07:00.000Z	gaelfx		ok, having a problem with utorrent, which actually seems to be having problems with ntfs-3g, here's syslog output: http://paste.ubuntu.com/36012/
2008-08-10T04:07:00.000Z	gaelfx		can anyone help me figure out how to fix the problem?
2008-08-10T04:09:00.000Z	gaelfx		well, gee, seems like everyone is wearing their sarcasm hats in lieu of their helping hats
2008-08-10T04:09:00.000Z	gaelfx		thanks a lot guys
2008-08-10T04:10:00.000Z	histo	gaelfx	on a serious note does the drive work fine otherwiese?
2008-08-10T04:10:00.000Z	gaelfx	histo	yeah, it works on a windows machine and on a mac just fine
2008-08-10T04:11:00.000Z	histo	gaelfx	no in linux are you able to use the ntfs drive normally.
2008-08-10T04:11:00.000Z	gaelfx	histo	yeah, usually
2008-08-10T04:11:00.000Z	gaelfx	histo	I can watch videos from it, and so forth
2008-08-10T04:11:00.000Z	histo	gaelfx	yes but can you write to it.
2008-08-10T04:12:00.000Z	gaelfx	histo	yeah, the torrent started off fine, it just seems to have a problem reading what it wrote
2008-08-10T04:12:00.000Z	gaelfx	histo	sorry, that made no sense, I mean this one torrent seems to be the only problem
2008-08-10T04:13:00.000Z	histo	gaelfx	can you write to the ntfs drive.
2008-08-10T04:13:00.000Z	gaelfx	histo	yes
2008-08-10T04:13:00.000Z	histo	gaelfx	well then perhaps utorent is the problem.
2008-08-10T04:13:00.000Z	histo	gaelfx	try using transmission and see if you continue to get errors other wise I would ask the wine guys perhaps.
2008-08-10T04:13:00.000Z	histo	gaelfx	/j #winehq
2008-08-10T04:16:00.000Z	gaelfx	histo	ok, I guess I'll try it
2008-08-10T04:25:00.000Z	gaelfx	histo	hey, Transmission doesn't even seem to be able to download at all
2010-11-05T14:52:00.000Z	histo	gaelfx	linkage?
2010-11-05T14:54:00.000Z	histo	gaelfx	whatever page you can't play sound from
