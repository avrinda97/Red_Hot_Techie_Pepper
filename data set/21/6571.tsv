2008-05-20T17:16:00.000Z	m1r		what is package name that take care of mounting/unmounting .iso images ?
2008-05-20T17:16:00.000Z	garrett__	m1r	mount -o loop?
2008-05-20T17:17:00.000Z	m1r	garrett__	i installed minimal ubuntu and it seems i dont have mount package, i tried with afuse and autofs i think but both not working
2008-05-20T17:17:00.000Z	garrett__	m1r	whoa. no mount?
2008-05-20T17:18:00.000Z	m1r	garrett__	yes, no mount
2008-05-20T17:18:00.000Z	garrett__	m1r	do you have a network connection?  can you just lookup what package provides mount?
2008-05-20T17:18:00.000Z	m1r	garrett__	on synaptic it drops all but "mount"
2008-05-20T17:19:00.000Z	m1r	garrett__	fdsss , i instaled autofs and afuse, but seems they not what is needed
2008-05-20T17:20:00.000Z	garrett__	m1r	according to dpkg -S (thanks jatt), the "mount" package provides mount
2008-05-20T17:20:00.000Z	garrett__	m1r	apt-get install mount?
2008-05-20T17:21:00.000Z	m1r	garrett__	does "mount" package exist ?
2008-05-20T17:22:00.000Z	m1r	garrett__	it says i have it already
2008-05-20T17:22:00.000Z	garrett__	m1r	cd / ; find | grep mount | grep bin
2008-05-20T17:22:00.000Z	garrett__	m1r	maybe it's just not in your path?
2008-05-20T17:23:00.000Z	m1r	garrett__	/bin/mount ; /bin/umount
2008-05-20T17:24:00.000Z	garrett__	m1r	then you have mount
2008-05-20T17:24:00.000Z	garrett__	m1r	try /bin/mount -o loop /bla/foo.so /mnt/mountpoint
2008-05-20T17:24:00.000Z	m1r	garrett__	yes it seems so, but is not working with nautilus
2008-05-20T17:24:00.000Z	garrett__	m1r	ah.  dunno.  i've never used nautilus
2008-05-20T17:25:00.000Z	garrett__	m1r	i was running fvwm2 and then blackbox for years :P  i just decided to install ubuntu the other day
2008-05-20T17:25:00.000Z	m1r	garrett__	:D
