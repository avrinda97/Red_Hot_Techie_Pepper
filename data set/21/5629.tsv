2009-10-30T21:13:00.000Z	dbruns		yesterday I started a dist-upgrade from within screen, today I came back and now I cant reattach my screen session because it says screen is not installed . . . is there any way to recover from this?
2009-10-30T21:15:00.000Z	dbruns		i can't apt-get install anything
2009-10-30T21:15:00.000Z	dbruns		"Unable to lock the administration directory, blah blah blah"
2009-10-30T21:17:00.000Z	dbruns		md64
2009-10-30T21:17:00.000Z	dbruns		this is funning on a virtual server
2009-10-30T21:17:00.000Z	dbruns		running*
2009-10-30T21:19:00.000Z	LjL	dbruns	then type « ./usr/bin/screen -r »
2009-10-30T21:13:00.000Z	LjL	dbruns	is the screen still running according to ps aux?
2009-10-30T21:14:00.000Z	dbruns	LjL	yes
2009-10-30T21:15:00.000Z	LjL	dbruns	maybe you could download the screen package manually, extract it and start the binary
2009-10-30T21:16:00.000Z	dbruns	LjL	i tried downloading the source and compiling it but it complains about a dependancy
2009-10-30T21:16:00.000Z	LjL	dbruns	forget about the source, just download the binary
2009-10-30T21:17:00.000Z	LjL	dbruns	i386 or md64?
2009-10-30T21:17:00.000Z	LjL	dbruns	still, 32 or 64 bit?
2009-10-30T21:18:00.000Z	LjL	dbruns	ah sorry didn't read
2009-10-30T21:18:00.000Z	LjL	dbruns	http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/s/screen/screen_4.0.3-13ubuntu4_amd64.deb
2009-10-30T21:18:00.000Z	LjL	dbruns	download that using wget or something, into a directory of its own, then type "ar x *.deb" to extract it
2009-10-30T21:19:00.000Z	LjL	dbruns	then type "tar xf *.tar.gz"
2009-10-30T21:19:00.000Z	LjL	dbruns	actually, type "tar xf data.tar.gz"
2009-10-30T21:19:00.000Z	dbruns	LjL	 yeah I should be able to go from here with the .deb
