2007-12-06T11:14:00.000Z	allnightarockin		Threefcata: http://www.practicallynetworked.com/sharing/xp_ics/
2007-12-06T11:15:00.000Z	threefcata	allnightarockin	thx, i just want to know which connection to share, the internet one or the wireless one, my ubuntu si connected to the xp box using wifi
2007-12-06T11:17:00.000Z	threefcata	allnightarockin	yeah, did you make it to work?
2007-12-06T11:18:00.000Z	allnightarockin	threefcata	No, just hoping someone would reply there and i figure you might wanna keep looking at the thread cuz someone will probably figure it out soon
2007-12-06T11:19:00.000Z	threefcata	allnightarockin	oh actually not exactly, i have a internet connection on my xp machine and i want to share it with my ubuntu which is connected to xp using wifi. i did a hell lot of googling to no avail..
2007-12-06T11:20:00.000Z	allnightarockin	threefcata	do you want to share it through Ethernet or Wifi?? just checking
2007-12-06T11:21:00.000Z	threefcata	allnightarockin	i don't quite get you, i'm a bit confused, my net is like this: ADSL->modem->XP->wifi->ubuntu, i want the ubuntu machine to be able to get online as well.
2007-12-06T11:22:00.000Z	allnightarockin	threefcata	Buy a wireless router?
2007-12-06T11:24:00.000Z	threefcata	allnightarockin	that's gonna take me 3 hours drive to get to town...now i can ping ubuntu on xp and also vice versa, i figure it's just the sharing thing is not working..
2007-12-06T11:25:00.000Z	allnightarockin	threefcata	^
2007-12-06T11:28:00.000Z	threefcata	allnightarockin	i did it, now my local area connection have ICS enabled, but i doubt i have to add something like gateway or dns on my ubuntu, i don't if that's needed coz i read something like when you have ICS enabled DHCP is also enabled but i don't get DHCP, so i manually configure things except gateway and dns
2007-12-06T11:29:00.000Z	allnightarockin	threefcata	yeah if what you just said doesnt work just change it to automatic dchp configuration?
2007-12-06T11:29:00.000Z	allnightarockin	threefcata	i would think atleast
2007-12-06T11:32:00.000Z	threefcata	allnightarockin	very true. and Network Manager is causing confusion as well, it is said now NM only manages those interfaces marked with auto or not appear in /etc/network/interfaces but i have all my interfaces in that file both marked auto AND manually configured..I the roaming mode of those interfaces are confusing as well..
2007-12-06T11:33:00.000Z	allnightarockin	threefcata	I really am not sure what u mean.. i would suggest starting a thread if the problem proceeds?
2007-12-06T11:34:00.000Z	threefcata	allnightarockin	yeah, maybe.. we'll see...
