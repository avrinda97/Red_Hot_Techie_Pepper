2006-01-20T12:32:00.000Z	Zonkle		Seaves, this makes no sense !!
2006-01-20T12:32:00.000Z	Zonkle		every time i open Synaptic I have to reload it from the internet !
2006-01-20T12:33:00.000Z	ompaul	Zonkle	it is only refereshing its info
2006-01-20T12:34:00.000Z	Zonkle	ompaul	it takes long time, cuz it downloads about  3MB of info ... and I only have dial up
2006-01-20T12:36:00.000Z	ompaul	Zonkle	you can run it there is a program called trickle that will restrict the bandwidth that it takes
2006-01-20T12:36:00.000Z	Zonkle	ompaul	thanks, can you please tell me more about it :S ? what does it do ?
2006-01-20T12:37:00.000Z	ompaul	Zonkle	let me work out a command line for you
2006-01-20T12:37:00.000Z	Zonkle	ompaul	:) thankssssssssssss
2006-01-20T12:41:00.000Z	Zonkle	ompaul	trickle just compress traffic right ?
2006-01-20T12:41:00.000Z	ompaul	Zonkle	it appears not to want to work for me :( sry
2006-01-20T12:41:00.000Z	ompaul	Zonkle	no it should keep the traffic in a steady state
2006-01-20T12:42:00.000Z	ompaul	Zonkle	limit the transmission
2006-01-20T12:42:00.000Z	Zonkle	ompaul	isn't that slowing down the connection ?!
2006-01-20T12:43:00.000Z	Zonkle	ompaul	but the weird thing is why Synaptic gets messed up every time ?
2006-01-20T12:43:00.000Z	ompaul	Zonkle	it slows down the transaction but then it does not hog your bandwidth so if you give it 1k then the rest is available for other things
2006-01-20T12:43:00.000Z	Zonkle	ompaul	that is not what i want
2006-01-20T12:43:00.000Z	Zonkle	ompaul	but thanks for trying
2006-01-20T12:44:00.000Z	ompaul	Zonkle	k
2006-01-20T12:51:00.000Z	ompaul	Zonkle	when Seveas said it was "an evil piece of * " he was being very polite
2006-01-20T12:51:00.000Z	Zonkle	ompaul	:D hahahaha
2006-01-20T12:51:00.000Z	ompaul	Zonkle	you need to look at easyubuntu
