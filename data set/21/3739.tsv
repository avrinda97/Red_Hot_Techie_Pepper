2008-10-07T20:37:00.000Z	JunHowl		why does this script give me the error: Missing argument to -exec
2008-10-07T20:37:00.000Z	JunHowl		find . -size +210c -exec ls -l {}
2008-10-07T20:37:00.000Z	Gnea	JunHowl	find . -size +210c -exec ls -l {} \;
2008-10-07T20:41:00.000Z	JunHowl	Gnea	 that command isn't 'piping' the results because I'm getting files less than 210bytes
2008-10-07T20:41:00.000Z	JunHowl	Gnea	that doesn't seem right to u?
2008-10-07T20:43:00.000Z	Gnea	JunHowl	you are?

2008-10-07T20:45:00.000Z	Gnea	JunHowl	and you're asking it to 'find' everything in whatever it finds
2008-10-07T20:46:00.000Z	JunHowl	Gnea	hmmm so how to modify? i tried taking out the .
2008-10-07T20:47:00.000Z	Gnea	JunHowl	find . -maxdepth 0 -size +210c -exec ls -l {} \;
