2009-03-08T22:08:00.000Z	tpw_rules		i just upgraded to kernel 2.6.24-23 on my acer aspire one, along with a bunch of other updates, and now it continually spews error messages to the console. in recovery mode it panics because it tried to kill init
2009-03-08T22:08:00.000Z	tpw_rules		anybody have ANY ideas?
2009-03-08T22:09:00.000Z	sanjud	tpw_rules	-> you are trying to kill init? how come?
2009-03-08T22:10:00.000Z	tpw_rules	sanjud	no when i boot up using the 2.6.24-23 kernel recovery it panics because it tried to kill init before even the ubuntu logo and progress bar appear
2009-03-08T22:12:00.000Z	sanjud	tpw_rules	-> umm can you try with grub option   single  to get into single user mode == recovery
2009-03-08T22:12:00.000Z	tpw_rules	sanjud	in normal mode it sometimes panics because it tried to kill init, and other times it constantly spews mounds of errors
2009-03-08T22:12:00.000Z	tpw_rules	sanjud	thats when it kernel panics
2009-03-08T22:13:00.000Z	sanjud	tpw_rules	-> even in single user mode it panics?
2009-03-08T22:13:00.000Z	tpw_rules	sanjud	other kernels work fine
2009-03-08T22:13:00.000Z	sanjud	tpw_rules	-> i dont know how old that is, try to re-install it?
2009-03-08T22:20:00.000Z	sanjud	tpw_rules	-> yes, and you can modify your menu.lst to make your old the default again
2009-03-08T22:14:00.000Z	tpw_rules	sanjud	its the most recent update
2009-03-08T22:14:00.000Z	sanjud	tpw_rules	-> perhaps its too new, for jaunty?
2009-03-08T22:15:00.000Z	tpw_rules	sanjud	its running hardy, and i updated it using the software updater. i didnt do something like compile the latest build, i just updated hardy using the gui updater
2009-03-08T22:16:00.000Z	sanjud	tpw_rules	-> i suspect the update screwed it up? did it finish entirely or somehow you have interrupted it?
2009-03-08T22:17:00.000Z	tpw_rules	sanjud	it finished entirely, but i was fooling with compiz settings while it was updating. also, it was installing like 120 other updates on top of the kernel
2009-03-08T22:17:00.000Z	sanjud	tpw_rules	-> well, i dont know what you have tinkered with,  reboot to the old and do a new update?
2009-03-08T22:18:00.000Z	tpw_rules	sanjud	can i uninstall the new kernel, or just try a new update
2009-03-08T22:19:00.000Z	sanjud	tpw_rules	-> you dont have to do anything to get back to the old kernel other than selecting it on grub menu
2009-03-08T22:20:00.000Z	tpw_rules	sanjud	i know. so for now, until a new kernel comes out, i should make grub boot to the previous kernel by default
2009-03-08T22:21:00.000Z	sanjud	tpw_rules	-> yw
