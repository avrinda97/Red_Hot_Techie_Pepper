2006-10-08T16:18:00.000Z	Cartas		I followed this (http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Dapper_Installation_Guide#Method_2:_Generating.2FInstalling_Ubuntu_packages_for_the_new_8.29.6_drivers_in_Ubuntu_Dapper_Manually) exactly, yet it still won't work!
2006-10-08T16:19:00.000Z	Cartas		Anyone here know how to get ATi drivers working? :(
2006-10-08T16:19:00.000Z	ronybeck	Cartas	have you install the driver?
2006-10-08T16:19:00.000Z	Cartas	ronybeck	As I said, I followed http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Dapper_Installation_Guide#Method_2:_Generating.2FInstalling_Ubuntu_packages_for_the_new_8.29.6_drivers_in_Ubuntu_Dapper_Manually exactly.
2006-10-08T16:19:00.000Z	ronybeck	Cartas	why install them manually?
2006-10-08T16:21:00.000Z	ronybeck	Cartas	yes, but why?
2006-10-08T16:22:00.000Z	ronybeck	Cartas	Why did you use this guide rather than install the ubuntu built drivers?
2006-10-08T16:23:00.000Z	ronybeck	Cartas	So is the problem the fglrx drivers or WoW?
2006-10-08T16:23:00.000Z	Cartas	ronybeck	 I've no idea.  I start WoW, and it crashes soon after.
2006-10-08T16:24:00.000Z	ronybeck	Cartas	Ah I get you
2006-10-08T16:24:00.000Z	ronybeck	Cartas	Ubuntu have the official ATI drivers in the repos
2006-10-08T16:24:00.000Z	ronybeck	Cartas	install them rather than the ones that come be default
2006-10-08T16:25:00.000Z	ronybeck	Cartas	use synaptic
2006-10-08T16:26:00.000Z	ronybeck	Cartas	apt-get install xorg-driver-fglrx
2006-10-08T16:27:00.000Z	ronybeck	Cartas	then edit the ` driver     "ati"`  to read `driver          "fglrx"` in /etc/x11/xorg.conf
2006-10-08T16:27:00.000Z	ronybeck	Cartas	how are you running WoW?
2006-10-08T16:27:00.000Z	ronybeck	Cartas	you could.  I think that does what you need
2006-10-08T16:28:00.000Z	ronybeck	Cartas	the problem with WoW is hard to trouble shoot with out knowing the symptoms
2006-10-08T16:29:00.000Z	ronybeck	Cartas	If the problem is just poor graphics performance then installing and configuring fglrx should fix it
2006-10-08T16:34:00.000Z	Cartas	ronybeck	Apparently, 8.29.6 drivers are the only ones which work for the x1900...
2006-10-08T16:35:00.000Z	ronybeck	Cartas	ah ok
