2008-05-22T08:49:00.000Z	RoadHazard	ZetaScript4	that usually indicates your hard drive is borked
2008-05-22T08:49:00.000Z	ZetaScript4	RoadHazard	Then how is Gentoo and Vista installed :o
2008-05-22T08:50:00.000Z	ZetaScript4	RoadHazard	Could it be due to the fact that I have no primary partitions open?
2008-05-22T08:51:00.000Z	RoadHazard	ZetaScript4	shouldnt, is it doing it before the partitioner stage of the install?
2008-05-22T08:51:00.000Z	ZetaScript4	RoadHazard	Nope...Just a "Try Ubuntu"
2008-05-22T08:52:00.000Z	RoadHazard	ZetaScript4	so, yes, before the partitioner, hmmm
2008-05-22T08:52:00.000Z	ZetaScript4	RoadHazard	It loads the kernel sits there for a few minutes then goes to the error screen
2008-05-22T08:53:00.000Z	ZetaScript4	RoadHazard	Directly after "Install" or "Try w/o changes to your computer"
2008-05-22T08:55:00.000Z	ZetaScript4	RoadHazard	This laptop is relatively new, perhaphs my HD isnt supported?
2008-05-22T08:56:00.000Z	ZetaScript4	RoadHazard	Ie the CD drive needed to be loaded as a pci and a few other things had to be worked around
2008-05-22T08:57:00.000Z	RoadHazard	ZetaScript4	an error like this? Buffer I/O error on device sr0, logical block 0
2008-05-22T08:58:00.000Z	ZetaScript4	RoadHazard	Yes exactly like that.
2008-05-22T08:59:00.000Z	ZetaScript4	RoadHazard	Only its logical block <Insert number 3000-4200>
2008-05-22T08:59:00.000Z	RoadHazard	ZetaScript4	heres a possibility http://www.adamstovicek.com/2008/05/hardy-heron-and-the-dvdrom-con.html
2008-05-22T08:59:00.000Z	ZetaScript4	RoadHazard	Okay Ill check it out
2008-05-22T09:03:00.000Z	ZetaScript4	RoadHazard	Im not sure thats the error...I get aq slightly different error
2008-05-22T09:03:00.000Z	RoadHazard	ZetaScript4	I'd bet its either bad drive or cable
