2012-11-24T16:00:00.000Z	koinandable		hello ... on 12.04 i have problems playing and ripping original audio cd's. some tracks (beginning of cd) are played/ripped with distorted sound. i tried with different programs (rhythmbox/sound juicer 4 rip / rhythmbox+xmms2 4 play) and on 2 different computers, the cd's are new original audio cd's that play fine on hw cd player. what can i try? is this a known issue with 12.04?
2012-11-24T16:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	koinandable	Distorted in what way? Can you upload a small example somewhere?
2012-11-24T16:03:00.000Z	koinandable	Jordan_U	distorted like overdriven, will try to find a site where i can upload audio
2012-11-24T16:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	koinandable	Might not help, but try ripping to mp3 and running "mp3gain /path/to/file.mp3" then try playing the mp3 again.
2012-11-24T16:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	koinandable	Interestingly, while it sounds somewhat like clipping, looking at the waveform in Audacity it doesn't look like clipping.
2012-11-24T16:19:00.000Z	koinandable	Jordan_U	ty, but i'm sure this wont do anything. this occurs with other cd's as well but only with the first 1-5 tracks, later tracks are/play ok
2012-11-24T16:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	koinandable	This person seems to have a similar problem, and fixed it with a firmware update: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1828139
2012-11-24T16:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	koinandable	Wait.
2012-11-24T16:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	koinandable	I just found out about a command called "cdparanoia" which might help.
2012-11-24T16:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	koinandable	If nothing else, it might tell you what's wrong.
2012-11-24T17:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	koinandable	I'm going to sleep soon :)
2012-11-24T16:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	koinandable	And I'm curious how this goes, so if you don't mind please keep me informed if cdparanoia works, or if you ever figure out more.
2012-11-24T16:35:00.000Z	koinandable	Jordan_U	... yes, true ... afk now, thx for your help again
2012-11-24T16:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	koinandable	You're welcome.
2012-11-24T16:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	koinandable	It looks like cdrtools uses libparanoia, and most tools used to use cdrtools until the licensing problems came to light: http://lwn.net/Articles/195167/
2012-11-24T16:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	koinandable	libparanoia itself doesn't have any licensing problems though.
2012-11-24T17:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	koinandable	Also, libparanoia doesn't have features that some people would like, among other things it can't extract metadata from CDs and it doesn't "make use of the maximum speed available from a CDROM drive." ( http://www.xiph.org/paranoia/faq.html#gimme ) which both make it less appealing as a default ripping library / utility. As you can see from that FAQ though, it is very focused on working around defects in hardware to ...
2012-11-24T17:47:00.000Z	koinandable	Jordan_U	are u there?
2012-11-24T17:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	koinandable	Yes.
2012-11-24T17:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	koinandable	But not for long.
2012-11-24T17:51:00.000Z	koinandable	Jordan_U	what do u mean by that?
