2012-02-16T16:36:00.000Z	kame		Lint but I need the newest version.    sudo apt-get update xchat doesn't work
2012-02-16T16:38:00.000Z	ikonia	kame	is it buggy for you ?
2012-02-16T16:37:00.000Z	ikonia	kame	why do you "need" the newest version ?
2012-02-16T16:37:00.000Z	kame	ikonia	 somebody said 2.8.6 is buggy
2012-02-16T16:38:00.000Z	ikonia	kame	I'm saying it's "not buggy" does that make it "ok" to use now ?
2012-02-16T16:39:00.000Z	kame	ikonia	i dont want to show messages in xchat when somebody is connected. and i don't know how to switch this off.
2012-02-16T16:39:00.000Z	ikonia	kame	ok - you don't need to upgrade for that
2012-02-16T16:40:00.000Z	kame	ikonia	thanks
2012-02-16T16:40:00.000Z	ikonia	kame	that's just a setting, someone in #xchat can tell you how to do that
2012-02-16T16:40:00.000Z	ikonia	kame	don't download packages from packages.debian.org
2012-02-16T16:40:00.000Z	ikonia	kame	unless you have a real reason to upgrade xchat - don't
2012-02-16T16:40:00.000Z	kame	ikonia	can you tell me? the right-click doesn't work
2012-02-16T16:40:00.000Z	ikonia	kame	you can disable join messages quite easy in the current version

2012-02-16T16:41:00.000Z	ikonia	kame	I don't know the german menu
2012-02-16T16:41:00.000Z	kame	ikonia	and in the english?
2012-02-16T16:42:00.000Z	ikonia	kame	I don't have xchat on this machine, someone in #xchat can tell you very easy
2012-02-16T16:42:00.000Z	ikonia	kame	/join #xchat and ask "how do I disable join/part messages in xchat" and they will tell you
2012-02-16T16:42:00.000Z	kame	ikonia	i thougt this here is #xchat. sorry

2012-02-16T16:44:00.000Z	ikonia	kame	look at cpufreq-applet and evince-thumbnail they are eating ram, I bet they are locking cpu, rather than using it
