2011-02-22T14:17:00.000Z	someonelikeme	gaelfx	seems phone not present
2011-02-22T14:21:00.000Z	gaelfx	someonelikeme	is the phone set up to be a modem right now? have you tried connecting it in mass storage mode?
2011-02-22T14:21:00.000Z	someonelikeme	gaelfx	i did not try that yet
2011-02-22T14:22:00.000Z	gaelfx	someonelikeme	if it recognizes it in storage mode, then it's a driver issue, if not, it's probably hardware
2011-02-22T14:23:00.000Z	someonelikeme	gaelfx	now i tried and it still does not appear in lsmod or in browser
2011-02-22T14:23:00.000Z	gaelfx	someonelikeme	have you tried putting it in a different socket?
2011-02-22T14:23:00.000Z	someonelikeme	gaelfx	yes
2011-02-22T14:24:00.000Z	gaelfx	someonelikeme	have you tried it in a different computer?
2011-02-22T14:24:00.000Z	someonelikeme	gaelfx	yes, but not recently
2011-02-22T14:24:00.000Z	gaelfx	someonelikeme	well, you should try that again sometime soon
