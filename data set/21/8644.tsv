2006-11-10T09:10:00.000Z	Mantice		were does edgy keep the install files it took me days to download this?
2006-11-10T09:11:00.000Z	Mantice		My ubuntu is fine its just beryl keeps booting I need to stop it some how.
2006-11-10T09:12:00.000Z	Mantice		Holycow: I dont have a cd I used the upgrade feature.
2006-11-10T09:13:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	Mantice	when you get to the main graphical login screen, click the lower left corner and change session to something other than gnome
2006-11-10T09:14:00.000Z	Mantice	Kingsqueak	I have gnome and beryl and terminal and thats what im using know.
2006-11-10T09:14:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	Mantice	if there aren't any, do   ctrl-alt-F1   then log in and do 'sudo apt-get install fluxbox'  or another window manager, when that's done, exit out of that login and do alt-F8
2006-11-10T09:15:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	Mantice	then log in but select 'fluxbox', once in there you can remove beryl
2006-11-10T09:15:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	Mantice	or you can do  'sudo apt-get remove beryl' from the terminal on ctrl-alt-F1
2006-11-10T09:37:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	Mantice	'sudo apt-get update'  then 'sudo apt-get upgrade'
2006-11-10T09:37:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	Mantice	that's what the updater is doing underneath
2006-11-10T09:38:00.000Z	Mantice	Kingsqueak	Thanks for your fluxbox suggestion it worked a treat
2006-11-10T09:38:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	Mantice	it's a nice simple window manager and it's quite flexible if you read up a bit on how to setup your own menus and keybindings too
2006-11-10T09:39:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	Mantice	if you are new to linux in general, try 'xfce' as well, might be called 'xfce4'
2006-11-10T09:39:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	Mantice	xfce is a middle ground between fluxbox and gnome sorta, more features than fluxbox but not as crazy as gnome and certainly worlds more stable than beryl
2006-11-10T09:40:00.000Z	Mantice	Kingsqueak	Ive used it before. Fluxbox saved me because when you boot using terminal you can only boot one program at time.
2006-11-10T09:41:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	Mantice	also you do know there are many terminals too right?  alt-F1 F2 F3 etc
2006-11-10T09:42:00.000Z	Mantice	Kingsqueak	can you only do that in terminal mode because alt f2 is run in gnome.
2006-11-10T09:43:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	Mantice	oh from X you do ctrl-alt-F1 or F2 etc, then from there to get back it's alt-F8 to return to X
2006-11-10T09:45:00.000Z	Mantice	Kingsqueak	thats cool Ill remember that one
2006-11-10T09:50:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	Mantice	when I did my upgrade, I had to redo my nvidia commercial driver install
2006-11-10T09:52:00.000Z	Mantice	Kingsqueak	ok ill reinstall mine.
