2007-04-01T07:01:00.000Z	eegore		Is there a way to increase the cpu utilization for a task on a dual core system?
2007-04-01T07:01:00.000Z	eegore		I am hitting 130% max
2007-04-01T07:01:00.000Z	eegore		I am at 130% now
2007-04-01T07:02:00.000Z	eegore		I have a Core 2 Duo and top is saying I am running at 130%
2007-04-01T07:03:00.000Z	eegore		Renicing does nothing
2007-04-01T07:04:00.000Z	eegore		I would like to spill the task a little more into the second core
2007-04-01T07:04:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	eegore	sounds like the second thread is just trying to do less than the first one.
2007-04-01T07:04:00.000Z	eegore		then it is just a kernel issue then
2007-04-01T07:05:00.000Z	eegore		just bumped itself up to 140%
2007-04-01T07:05:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	eegore	possibly, or else the second thread depends on data produced by the first one, thus its speed will be capped by how fast the first thread can produce data
2007-04-01T07:06:00.000Z	eegore		This is just doing the first pass to a file
2007-04-01T07:07:00.000Z	eegore		this process use to take 3 hours
2007-04-01T07:07:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	eegore	video encoding?
2007-04-01T07:07:00.000Z	eegore		not it is only taking 80n minutes
2007-04-01T07:07:00.000Z	eegore		yes
2007-04-01T07:08:00.000Z	eegore	SlimeyPete	yes
2007-04-01T07:08:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	eegore	AFAIK video encoders rarely if ever make full use of the second core because the second thread is simply not doing as much work as the first one. I may be wrong though - it's a while since I read up on it.
2007-04-01T07:08:00.000Z	SlimeyPete		video encoding is quite a linear process
2007-04-01T07:10:00.000Z	eegore	SlimeyPete	this is the test I am trying to see how long it will take for a render and animate for a 60 fps blander project
2007-04-01T07:11:00.000Z	eegore		not to mention the encoding
2007-04-01T07:12:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	eegore	hmm, I'd have thought the actual rendering process would make full use of both cores. Not sure though.
