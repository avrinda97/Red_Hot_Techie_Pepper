2006-03-24T12:46:00.000Z	na7e	lowroad	you're behind a router that does PAT, more than likely, and which in effect performs as a firewall
2006-03-24T12:47:00.000Z	na7e	lowroad	the router will probably call it NAT (but it's actually not)
2006-03-24T12:47:00.000Z	lowroad	na7e	 do you know how i can fix that?
2006-03-24T12:48:00.000Z	na7e	lowroad	log into your router and setup port-forwarding appropriately
2006-03-24T13:05:00.000Z	na7e	lowroad	you probably need to allow for it in iptables then
2006-03-24T13:05:00.000Z	na7e	lowroad	let me look for a link for ya
2006-03-24T13:12:00.000Z	na7e	lowroad	still looking
2006-03-24T13:14:00.000Z	na7e	lowroad	what ports are you using for gnutella?
2006-03-24T13:16:00.000Z	na7e	lowroad	you there?
2006-03-24T13:37:00.000Z	lowroad	na7e	 icant get this to work.  i dont know what im doing wrong
2006-03-24T13:38:00.000Z	lowroad	na7e	 i set the port as open in firestarter but it keeps telling me that Im firewalled both TCP wise and UDP wise
2006-03-24T13:38:00.000Z	lowroad	na7e	 at this point im plugged directly into my modem
2006-03-24T13:39:00.000Z	na7e	lowroad	did you use the wiki i gave you?
2006-03-24T13:39:00.000Z	lowroad	na7e	 i checked it out, i used the last pat of it, where it says turn the whole firewall off
2006-03-24T13:39:00.000Z	lowroad	na7e	 iptables -F
2006-03-24T13:39:00.000Z	na7e	lowroad	and no luck?
2006-03-24T13:39:00.000Z	lowroad	na7e	 that didn't work
2006-03-24T13:40:00.000Z	na7e	lowroad	i don't know what to say then man
2006-03-24T13:40:00.000Z	lowroad	na7e	 thanks for trying man, i'll keep looking into it
