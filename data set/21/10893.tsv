2004-10-07T13:36:00.000Z	sri		but it doesn'twork in this case. :/
2004-10-07T13:37:00.000Z	sri		this shuldn't be hard, it's the only disk on the laptop
2004-10-07T13:39:00.000Z	sri		hda3
2004-10-07T13:39:00.000Z	sri		sorry
2004-10-07T13:39:00.000Z	sri		busy typing in (hd0,2) in grub :)
2004-10-07T13:39:00.000Z	sri		so I"m not sure why it can't mount the root fs
2004-10-07T13:40:00.000Z	sri		I see it in saying failed to mount (hd0,0) but the root=is correctly teh right one
2004-10-07T13:40:00.000Z	sri		yeah
2004-10-07T13:40:00.000Z	sri		so it sees the disk fine
2004-10-07T13:40:00.000Z	sri		I had a similar problem on another box
2004-10-07T13:40:00.000Z	LinuxJones	sri	do you have the filesystems built into the kernel and NOT as modules right ?
2004-10-07T13:40:00.000Z	sri		and I was able to fix it by using majorminor number
2004-10-07T13:41:00.000Z	sri	LinuxJones	it's whatever the config that comes with the stock debian kernel
2004-10-07T13:41:00.000Z	sri		and did make oldconfig
2004-10-07T13:41:00.000Z	sri	LinuxJones	one would hope thats taken care of but i can certainly check
2004-10-07T13:42:00.000Z	sri		hrm
2004-10-07T13:42:00.000Z	LinuxJones	sri	as I recall they are built as modules and use an initrd.
2004-10-07T13:42:00.000Z	sri		yes, ext3 is a module
2004-10-07T13:42:00.000Z	sri		piece of shit.
2004-10-07T13:42:00.000Z	sri		okay, need to recompile it :)
2004-10-07T13:42:00.000Z	LinuxJones	sri	LOL
