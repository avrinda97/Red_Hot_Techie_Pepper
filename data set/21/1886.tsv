2010-03-30T03:57:00.000Z	kinja-sheep		Meh. Ubuntu does not recognize my hard drive (Fujitsu MHW2020BH) and prompted me to select a particular driver needed for my HDD. How can I find out which driver I need? Is there some kind of list?
2010-03-30T03:58:00.000Z	StevenUK	kinja-sheep	: how is it connected - usb firewire Sata?
2010-03-30T03:58:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	StevenUK	Internal HDD.  SATA.
2010-03-30T03:59:00.000Z	StevenUK	kinja-sheep	are your other disks connected this way?
2010-03-30T04:00:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	StevenUK	Yes. And the other disks are disabled temporarily (in the bios) for this installation.
2010-03-30T04:00:00.000Z	StevenUK	kinja-sheep	have you tried with them enabled and just that disk?
2010-03-30T04:00:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	StevenUK	In the past, yes. It ended with the same result.
2010-03-30T04:01:00.000Z	StevenUK	kinja-sheep	does teh bios have a PATA compatibility mode - or no raid?
2010-03-30T04:02:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	StevenUK	I'm not setting up for RAID. I do recall there are something like PATA in the bios. I would have to check the bios again to verify exactly.
2010-03-30T04:03:00.000Z	StevenUK	kinja-sheep	that option will present teh sata as a normal pata disk
2010-03-30T04:03:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	StevenUK	Okay. I'll try that. (Be back in 5~)
2010-03-30T04:07:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	StevenUK	Well, I enabled the PATA (although I had no PATA drives). I'm searching on engines for a particular driver module that I need to include. I just don't know which one to select (from a list of 50+ module).
2010-03-30T04:10:00.000Z	StevenUK	kinja-sheep	hmm unlucky
2010-03-30T04:11:00.000Z	StevenUK	kinja-sheep	which Version are you using? (ubuntu)
2010-03-30T04:11:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	StevenUK	Well -- The development version but that's not really the issue in first place. I'm using minimal installation approach.
2010-03-30T04:12:00.000Z	StevenUK	kinja-sheep	does it work when you use a full Live CD/USB?
2010-03-30T04:13:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	StevenUK	It did. (when I was messing around with Kubuntu Live-Desktop Beta1).
2010-03-30T04:13:00.000Z	StevenUK	kinja-sheep	Right why not fire it back up and work out which driver is making it work
2010-03-30T04:14:00.000Z	StevenUK	kinja-sheep	lspci should give it you
2010-03-30T04:14:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	StevenUK	That is a long way to find out. I'll look into my other machine. I might get lucky with something.
2010-03-30T04:14:00.000Z	StevenUK	kinja-sheep	good luck
