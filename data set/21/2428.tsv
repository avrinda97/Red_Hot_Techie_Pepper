2010-01-28T12:40:00.000Z	nomnex	mobi-sheep	I want to remove the keys, completely
2010-01-28T12:41:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	nomnex	Do it in gconf-editor
2010-01-28T12:41:00.000Z	nomnex	mobi-sheep	you cannot remove keys you add from the GUI.
2010-01-28T12:41:00.000Z	nomnex	mobi-sheep	you need to use the command line
2010-01-28T12:44:00.000Z	nomnex	mobi-sheep	these key have no schema, do you know how to remove them?
2010-01-28T12:44:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	nomnex	I'm reading the manual page. You could try --unset
2010-01-28T12:45:00.000Z	nomnex	mobi-sheep	I will tray that, what manual page do you read?
2010-01-28T12:45:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	nomnex	http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/admin-guide/gconf-6.html
2010-01-28T12:56:00.000Z	nomnex	mobi-sheep	what's the --unset command for "gconftool-2 -t string -s /desktop/gnome/url-handlers/magnet/command 'deluge "%s"" I don't pass the correct string. Can you help?
2010-01-28T12:58:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	nomnex	Try "gconftool-2 --recursive-unset /desktop/gnome/url-handlers/magnet"
2010-01-28T13:08:00.000Z	nomnex	mobi-sheep	I am worry since the command did not delete what was under /magnet but the folder itself.
2010-01-28T13:01:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	nomnex	Working for you? It should unset everything under 'magnet' directory.
2010-01-28T13:02:00.000Z	nomnex	mobi-sheep	just a sec,
2010-01-28T13:07:00.000Z	nomnex	mobi-sheep	/desktop/gnome/url-handlers/magnet folder is gone. Can you tell me is it present on a default config or the folder is created after I have passed my 3 commands?
2010-01-28T13:09:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	nomnex	It is url-handlers. It either can be there or not, depending on each individual users. You can add it. It does not have to be there.
2010-01-28T13:09:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	nomnex	Test the magnet link.
2010-01-28T13:10:00.000Z	nomnex	mobi-sheep	thank you very much, you have sorted my problem.
2010-01-28T13:10:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	nomnex	No problem.
