2009-03-16T02:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gumbo	you can multiboot as much space as you have
2009-03-16T02:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gumbo	none are better or best, its all personal choice
2009-03-16T02:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gumbo	if a boot loader does wat you need to do, its best
2009-03-16T02:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gumbo	try a few, see which you like
2009-03-16T02:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gumbo	you just need to install the boot sector or whatever system you use (e.g NTLDR) if you uninstall it
2009-03-16T02:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gumbo	thats got nothing to do with ubuntu or grub being "bad", if you remove the files needed for grub to work then it wont work
2009-03-16T02:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gumbo	thats like having a pure windows system and deleting boot.ini
2009-03-16T02:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gumbo	its not the bootloader, its your actions as a user
2009-03-16T02:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gumbo	/boot
2009-03-16T02:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gumbo	if you make a 20Mb /boot partition then it doesnt matter if you delete ubuntu as the grub loader will still work
2011-07-02T18:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gumbo	you may need to fsck the partition when it is unmounted
