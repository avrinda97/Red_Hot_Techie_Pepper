2008-06-25T06:55:00.000Z	pccc		I'm trying to boot from cd; how come there is no option to 'start ubuntu or install from disk'. The only option is 'install to the hard disk'?
2008-06-25T06:55:00.000Z	tech0007	pccc	do u have the livecd or alternate cd?
2008-06-25T06:56:00.000Z	pccc	tech0007	I didn't hit the checkbox for the alternate cd... i just downloaded the default
2008-06-25T06:56:00.000Z	pccc	tech0007	so i assume that's the livecd?
2008-06-25T06:56:00.000Z	tech0007	pccc	you should doublecheck the iso you burned
2008-06-25T06:59:00.000Z	pccc	tech0007	is there any way to check whether it's the live cd by looking at the files on the cd?
2008-06-25T07:00:00.000Z	tech0007	pccc	dont have the iso atm,sorry
2008-06-25T07:02:00.000Z	tech0007	pccc	and can you also check if you've d/l the desktop edn not the server one
2008-06-25T07:02:00.000Z	pccc	tech0007	i have the 64-bit server edition; there is no livecd for server?
2008-06-25T07:03:00.000Z	tech0007	pccc	server edn does not run the gui
2008-06-25T07:04:00.000Z	pccc	tech0007	oic, that's right. i installed the gui separately. well, thanks
2008-06-25T11:09:00.000Z	tech0007	pccc	what is ur HDD?
2008-06-25T11:10:00.000Z	pccc	tech0007	wd740
2008-06-25T11:11:00.000Z	pccc	tech0007	western digital wd740 raptor
2008-06-25T11:12:00.000Z	pccc	tech0007	but gparted detects correctly when i'm running ubuntu server from disk
2008-06-25T11:13:00.000Z	tech0007	pccc	check it out http://www.sysresccd.org/
2008-06-25T11:14:00.000Z	pccc	tech0007	ok
2008-06-25T11:19:00.000Z	pccc	tech0007	I will try the system rescue cd. it doesn't make sense to me why gparted running off disk would detect the hdd correctly but gparted running off live cd wouldn't. different versions maybe?
2008-06-25T11:19:00.000Z	tech0007	pccc	could be.  hope it works
2008-06-25T11:20:00.000Z	pccc	tech0007	tnx
2008-06-25T11:35:00.000Z	pccc	tech0007	sys recovery cd worked! thanks!
