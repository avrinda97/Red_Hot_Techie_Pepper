2009-05-11T10:35:00.000Z	jigp		Flannel : there is no upgrade in 8.04 to 8.10 here http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/upgrading
2009-05-11T10:36:00.000Z	jigp		ok thanks :)
2009-05-11T10:38:00.000Z	zvacet	jigp	8.10 i you want to upgrade
2009-05-11T10:38:00.000Z	jigp	zvacet	yup I want to upgrade 8.04 to 9.04?
2009-05-11T10:39:00.000Z	zvacet	jigp	but you can not skip versions so you havve to upgrade to 8.10 first and then from 8.10>9.04
2009-05-11T10:40:00.000Z	zvacet	jigp	my advice is to use alternate CD in case something goes wrong you will always have CD for fresh install
2009-05-11T10:42:00.000Z	jigp	zvacet	how about install ubuntu 9.04 directly?good?from ubuntu 8.04 to ubuntu 9.04..i have cd 9.04
2009-05-11T10:43:00.000Z	jigp	zvacet	 but the problem is, how to back up my chat pidgin logs?from 8.04 to 9.04?
2009-05-11T10:43:00.000Z	zvacet	jigp	: only if you want fresh install in that case it is good to have separate home partition
2009-05-11T10:44:00.000Z	zvacet	jigp	: if you don´t have separate home read http://www.ivankuznetsov.com/2008/04/moving-home-to-its-own-partition.html
2009-05-11T10:46:00.000Z	jigp	zvacet	I don't have partition as of the moment when I install ubuntu 8.04..thats why when I instsall 9.04 it should have partition soon
2009-05-11T10:48:00.000Z	zvacet	jigp	: I will recommend you to make separate home now you see why is useful to have one
2009-05-11T11:00:00.000Z	jigp	zvacet	I guess better to use 9.04 then...
2009-05-11T11:01:00.000Z	zvacet	jigp	with separate home,yes just don´t format home partition during install
2009-05-11T11:02:00.000Z	jigp	zvacet	this is like: I will create new home then I can install 9.04?and the files still there? (currenlty I have no partition in 8.04)
2009-05-11T11:03:00.000Z	zvacet	jigp	: yes read  http://psychocats.s465.sureserver.com/ubuntu/separatehome
2009-05-11T11:07:00.000Z	zvacet	jigp	yoes it will work in gnome it is just app like all others
2009-05-11T11:08:00.000Z	jigp	zvacet	nope its not working here right now.i even restarted the gnome..ktorrent won't show up
2009-05-11T11:08:00.000Z	zvacet	jigp	use any torrent clien to download iso
2009-05-11T11:09:00.000Z	zvacet	jigp	: I´m off too see you
2009-05-11T11:09:00.000Z	jigp	zvacet	kindofbuzz : no need to download the 8.10..ill just install 9.04 directly using cd..but then again I don't have partition so how am I supposed to backup my files
