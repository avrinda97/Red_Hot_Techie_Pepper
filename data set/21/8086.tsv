2008-04-05T15:17:00.000Z	hunter_		hi shawe
2008-04-05T15:18:00.000Z	stefg	hunter_	pastebin your dmesg. bootchart isn't the right tool for debugging
2008-04-05T15:22:00.000Z	stefg	hunter_	k, lemme look
2008-04-05T15:26:00.000Z	stefg	hunter_	afaics you're still trying to load a buggy driver. look at line 331+
2008-04-05T15:28:00.000Z	hunter_	stefg	can i do something to remove that , thanks
2008-04-05T15:28:00.000Z	stefg	hunter_	what did you do to install it?
2008-04-05T15:33:00.000Z	stefg	hunter_	so ok... so you were following instructions without knowing what you were doing.... pastebin your /etc/modues
2008-04-05T15:34:00.000Z	stefg	hunter_	 /etc/modules that is
2008-04-05T15:35:00.000Z	stefg	hunter_	cat /etc/modules
2008-04-05T15:36:00.000Z	hunter_	stefg	here is the link http://pastebin.com/d59b7f5b5
2008-04-05T15:38:00.000Z	stefg	hunter_	hm.. ok, so the buggy driver isn't loaded by this mechanism. looks normal. did you run any 'setup.sh' or other install script from your downloaded package ?
2008-04-05T15:40:00.000Z	hunter_	stefg	do u want to have a look at the cam driver?
2008-04-05T15:40:00.000Z	stefg	hunter_	so it's quite hard to track down how the driver slipped in your configuration, b/c you actaully did not understand waht you were doing. what does uname -r return ?
2008-04-05T15:42:00.000Z	stefg	hunter_	try sudo apt-get install-reinstall linux-image-2.6.22-14-generic . this will reinstall the kernel , and i hope this will undo the misconfiguration. try to reboot after that.
2008-04-05T15:42:00.000Z	stefg	hunter_	sudo apt-get install --reinstall linux-image-2.6.22-14-generic .
2008-04-05T15:43:00.000Z	hunter_	stefg	which command should i use? the first one or the second?
2008-04-05T15:43:00.000Z	stefg	hunter_	second one is correct
2008-04-05T15:45:00.000Z	stefg	hunter_	of course... but a reinstall will of course wipe your ubuntu partition, so backup any data that you might need
2008-04-05T15:48:00.000Z	hunter_	stefg	thanks a lot, re installation has finished, will c u soon bye
