2007-08-20T09:31:00.000Z	jrib	fevel	have you checked bugs.ubuntu.com to make sure that isn't a bug?
2007-08-20T09:34:00.000Z	jrib	fevel	see https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/vlc/+bug/81378

2007-10-26T18:25:00.000Z	fevel	jrib	can you explaina little better? I didnt understand
2007-10-26T18:26:00.000Z	jrib	fevel	wmctrl is a command.  It is in the "wmctrl" package.  You'll have to read its documetation after you install it to see how to use it (type 'man wmctrl')
2007-10-26T18:52:00.000Z	jrib	fevel	ctrl-alt-d, see system -> preferences -> keyboard shortcut keys
