2011-03-06T13:43:00.000Z	marz		can't I install ubuntu 10.10 without an internet connection?
2011-03-06T13:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	marz	 you can install without an internet connection.
2011-03-06T13:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	marz	 ive done it befor with no networking..   You sure its not doing somthing else in thebackground like setting up the disks or so forth. or just crashing.
2011-03-06T13:44:00.000Z	marz	Dr_Willis	The HDD i'm installing it on is brand new
2011-03-06T13:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	marz	 you could partition it beforhand, and format it via gparted to save some time.
2011-03-06T13:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	marz	 you CAN install without internet connection.  that shouldent be your issue.
2011-03-06T13:45:00.000Z	marz	Dr_Willis	when I tried canceling the installation it redirected me to the ubuntu OS desktop with the icon Instal ubuntu 10.10
2011-03-06T13:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	marz	 you cancled the installer  so it went to the desktop.
2011-03-06T13:46:00.000Z	marz	Dr_Willis	how do i partition the disk beforehand?
2011-03-06T13:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	marz	 via 'gparted' is now i normally do it.  'sudo apt-get install gparted'  then 'gksudo gparted'
2011-03-06T13:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	marz	 you have an OS.. youi are running it from  cd. :)
2011-03-06T13:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	marz	 its possivle the iso image you put on flash was currupted..
2011-03-06T13:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	marz	 drivers and so forth.. will proberly need a network connection.
2011-03-06T13:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	marz	 but only a few drivers are ever needed for my systems
2011-03-06T13:47:00.000Z	marz	Dr_Willis	that's what i thought
2011-03-06T13:48:00.000Z	marz	Dr_Willis	i won't even detect a flash drive when I tried connecting one
2011-03-06T13:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	marz	 try mounting it by hand.   You did check the md5sum of the iso befor you put it on flash drive?
2011-03-06T13:49:00.000Z	marz	Dr_Willis	i just followed the instruction on Ubuntu.com
2011-03-06T13:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	marz	 you did verify the iso image was downloaded properly?
2011-03-06T13:49:00.000Z	marz	Dr_Willis	yup
2011-03-06T13:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	marz	 could be some quirk with your system and the installer. You can run the installer from  a terminal and monitor error messages.
