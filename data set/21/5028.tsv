2008-01-14T06:31:00.000Z	ironfoot_495		Hi, I have aproblem with apache2, mysql phpmyadmin they all don't work due to trying to incorporate Rails and gems. I would like to start over with these  but by using lamp is that possible?
2008-01-14T06:32:00.000Z	Flannel	ironfoot_495	starting over is always possible.  remove the packages and reinstall.  Just be sure removal is done with --purge (or "complete removal in synaptic") to get rid of the configs as well
2008-01-14T06:35:00.000Z	ironfoot_495	Flannel	is lamp possible
2008-01-14T06:35:00.000Z	Flannel	ironfoot_495	apt-get remove --purge package name list goes here
2008-01-14T06:36:00.000Z	ironfoot_495	Flannel	ok got it
2008-01-14T06:44:00.000Z	ironfoot_495	Flannel	is there a phpmyadmin.conf file some where?
2008-01-14T06:50:00.000Z	Flannel	ironfoot_495	It'll be in your web directory, if its anywhere.
2008-01-14T06:50:00.000Z	Flannel	ironfoot_495	Or part of the DB
2008-01-14T07:14:00.000Z	Flannel	ironfoot_495	Use LAMP instead.  You dont need xampp on ubuntu, since you have package management
2008-01-14T07:16:00.000Z	ironfoot_495	Flannel	ok!!!
2008-01-14T07:18:00.000Z	ironfoot_495	Flannel	It does'nt appear to be on my machine?
2008-01-14T07:18:00.000Z	Flannel	ironfoot_495	What doesnt?
2008-01-14T07:19:00.000Z	Flannel	ironfoot_495	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP  Its just a couple of commands, not a real package (because of the variety of configurations it could be)
2008-01-14T07:20:00.000Z	ironfoot_495	Flannel	lamp!!!
2008-01-14T07:28:00.000Z	ironfoot_495	Flannel	 this is the error I get => tasksel: aptitude failed (100)
2008-01-14T08:16:00.000Z	ironfoot_495	Flannel	nothing seems to work reinstalling apache2 I get the error => apache2: Could not open configuration file /etc/apache2/apache2.conf: No such file or directory
2008-01-14T08:16:00.000Z	Flannel	ironfoot_495	You need to reinstall apache2.2-common to reinstall that file.  apache2 isn't enough
2008-01-14T08:17:00.000Z	ironfoot_495	Flannel	ok
2008-01-14T08:20:00.000Z	ironfoot_495	Flannel	 still not working used what you requested => apache2: Could not open configuration file /etc/apache2/apache2.conf: No such file or directory
2008-01-14T08:20:00.000Z	ironfoot_495	Flannel	apache2: Could not open configuration file /etc/apache2/apache2.conf: No such file or directory
2008-01-14T08:20:00.000Z	Flannel	ironfoot_495	Did you completely remove apache2.2-common?
