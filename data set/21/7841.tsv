2006-07-05T09:35:00.000Z	Eric2		I've been trying the past hour or two and I can't mount //Laura/Downloads to a local directory in Ubuntu 6.06, any ideas?
2006-07-05T09:37:00.000Z	Eric2		anyone here by chance have the fstab to a smbfs?
2006-07-05T09:37:00.000Z	kaot	Eric2	I used to know how to do this.... :P  mount -t smbfs -o username=<username, password=<password>, '\\box\share\' /mnt/point i think
2006-07-05T09:37:00.000Z	kaot	Eric2	I did this all the time a few years ago but all the boxes I had set up that way are dead :(
2006-07-05T09:37:00.000Z	Eric2	kaot	I'm on the live cd, mount -t is supposed to work but it's f0rking up on me, thanks though, I'll see if it does anything ^_^
2006-07-05T09:38:00.000Z	kaot	Eric2	error?
2006-07-05T09:38:00.000Z	Eric2	kaot	1 second, yeah error

2006-07-05T09:43:00.000Z	Eric2	kaot	IRC didn't send it to you?
2006-07-05T09:44:00.000Z	Eric2	kaot	maybe it thought it was a flood

2006-07-05T09:47:00.000Z	kaot	Eric2	ahh.  I don't know if you can specify IP addresses without a specific option in the mount command, by default it's looking for netbios names i believe
2006-07-05T09:48:00.000Z	Eric2	kaot	thanks for the tip, I just figured it would be more specific, guess not, ty
2006-07-05T09:48:00.000Z	Eric2	kaot	you see anything else in the syntax by chance?
2006-07-05T09:49:00.000Z	kaot	Eric2	well the thing that stands out is the IP address in place of the computer name.  you might need an lmhosts file containing a name to IP mapping
2006-07-05T09:49:00.000Z	kaot	Eric2	can't for the life of me remember where that goes :(
2006-07-05T09:49:00.000Z	kaot		/etc/lmhosts maybe or in your /etc/samba
2006-07-05T09:50:00.000Z	Eric2	kaot	thanks, I'll try to fix it myself and let you go, but thanks so much for the input dude
