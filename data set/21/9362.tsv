2005-10-12T11:33:00.000Z	KasperTech		ATI drivers, anyone??
2005-10-12T11:35:00.000Z	KasperTech		Now, PLEASE. I've got to make this work?
2005-10-12T11:35:00.000Z	KasperTech		What do I do to make my ATI Radeon x600 run properly (like without crashing in TuxRacer)??
2005-10-12T11:36:00.000Z	djm62	KasperTech	search the wiki for ati, there are driver things
2005-10-12T11:36:00.000Z	KasperTech		I *have* installed the FGLRX driver, it sucks.
2005-10-12T11:36:00.000Z	KasperTech		What else can I do? ompaul and djm62.
2005-10-12T11:37:00.000Z	djm62	KasperTech	uncomment the "sucks" option in xorg.conf or provide better information on what goes wrong
2005-10-12T11:37:00.000Z	KasperTech	djm62	It's able to pull Xorg alright. But when I run Tuxracer it lacks horribly.
2005-10-12T11:37:00.000Z	KasperTech		Can't even move the pointer without extreme lag.
2005-10-12T11:38:00.000Z	djm62	KasperTech	glxgears?
2005-10-12T11:38:00.000Z	KasperTech		What's that?
2005-10-12T11:38:00.000Z	djm62	KasperTech	in fact, run glxinfo and see what it says about Direct Rendering
2005-10-12T11:38:00.000Z	KasperTech	djm62	A sec, will you hang on :)?
2005-10-12T11:39:00.000Z	djm62		no worries
2005-10-12T11:39:00.000Z	KasperTech	djm62	Thanks :) It says Direct Rendering: no
2005-10-12T11:40:00.000Z	djm62	KasperTech	that's a configuration thing, the acceleration isn't broke, it just isn't on
2005-10-12T11:40:00.000Z	KasperTech		I see.
2005-10-12T11:41:00.000Z	KasperTech	djm62	The solution would then be to turn that Rendering on, right? But How???
2005-10-12T11:41:00.000Z	djm62	KasperTech	you'll need to change some settings in your xorg.conf, try googling xorg and the name of your card
2005-10-12T11:41:00.000Z	KasperTech		Okay.
2005-10-12T11:41:00.000Z	djm62	KasperTech	it's not heavy stuff, some "no"s to "yes"s
