2011-12-28T10:42:00.000Z	venkatmangudi_	iggy19	you can also use top in a terminal
2011-12-28T10:46:00.000Z	iggy19	venkatmangudi_	can you explain how I might use top to solve this problem?
2011-12-28T10:46:00.000Z	venkatmangudi_	iggy19	i am assuming you're killing a process in top?
2011-12-28T10:47:00.000Z	venkatmangudi_	iggy19	top will give you the list of processes
2011-12-28T10:47:00.000Z	venkatmangudi_	iggy19	pressing k will ask you for PID
2011-12-28T10:47:00.000Z	venkatmangudi_	iggy19	then you either use 15 (default) or 9 ...
2011-12-28T10:49:00.000Z	iggy19	venkatmangudi_	top does not list the ff process?  How to make it show more than a subset of processes
2011-12-28T10:52:00.000Z	venkatmangudi_	iggy19	tried everyring here? http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/show-all-running-processes-in-linux/
2011-12-28T10:52:00.000Z	iggy19	venkatmangudi_	no browser to browse with. lol
2011-12-28T10:54:00.000Z	venkatmangudi_	iggy19	i came in late to the game
2011-12-28T10:55:00.000Z	venkatmangudi_	iggy19	this is the problem? heyall, firefix crashed, and I right-click force-closed it, but the process is still listed in ps and it won't restart (says it is still running).  kill -9 <pid> appears to do nothing.  Advice?  TIA!
2011-12-28T10:56:00.000Z	iggy19	venkatmangudi_	yes.  thank you
2011-12-28T10:58:00.000Z	venkatmangudi_	iggy19	gnome-system-monitor
2011-12-28T10:58:00.000Z	iggy19	venkatmangudi_	killall - I did not know that command.  Just tried it.  Says no firefix process.  Can I give it a wildcard (*)?
2011-12-28T11:03:00.000Z	venkatmangudi_	iggy19	why the swearing? found something?
2011-12-28T11:14:00.000Z	venkatmangudi_	iggy19	looks like a common issue
2011-12-28T11:18:00.000Z	venkatmangudi_	iggy19	from what i see in that link, the OP had a problem with a plugin
2011-12-28T11:19:00.000Z	iggy19	venkatmangudi_	ps axopid,comm,wchan shows: 14146 firefox-bin sync_page
2011-12-28T11:19:00.000Z	venkatmangudi_	iggy19	so sync_page is the routine that is keeping FF in D state
2011-12-28T11:20:00.000Z	venkatmangudi_	iggy19	probably
2011-12-28T11:21:00.000Z	venkatmangudi_	iggy19	therein lies your problem
