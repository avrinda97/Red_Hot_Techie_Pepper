2007-08-20T05:45:00.000Z	mikubuntu		when i tried to remove gaim, it said i couldn't remove it because one or more programs depended on it
2007-08-20T05:46:00.000Z	mikubuntu		omg.  that's not *good
2007-08-20T05:46:00.000Z	mikubuntu		does anyone know of any security issues related to Gaim?  when i start Gaim, i have been getting spam messages addressed to various aliases i have used in my yahoo messenger in the past, which makes me think that someone has gained access to my yahoo messenger account.  also, i am experiencing connection slowdowns.  anybody have any insights?
2007-08-20T05:46:00.000Z	mikubuntu		that's why i tried to remove it
