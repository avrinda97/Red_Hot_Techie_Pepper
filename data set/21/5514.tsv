2008-04-15T07:28:00.000Z	bazhang	sparr_	here I must defer; that is very risky behaviour
2008-04-15T07:27:00.000Z	sparr_	bazhang	ubuntu and debian.  i want to install one package and its dependencies from debian.  right now ive got that package pinned to the debian repo, but apt says the dependencies coming from the ubuntu repo are too old
2008-04-15T07:28:00.000Z	sparr_	bazhang	i agree, but i am left little choice when ubuntu doesn't get the new packages for months
2008-04-15T07:29:00.000Z	bazhang	sparr_	then run sidux
2008-04-15T07:29:00.000Z	sparr_	bazhang	i dont see how that would be any better than just running debian
2008-04-15T07:31:00.000Z	bazhang	sparr_	if you want the very newest of the new then that or fedora would be the best bets; going outside ubuntu to get the newest before they are officially certified not to break your machine is a seriously risky proposition
2008-04-15T07:31:00.000Z	sparr_	bazhang	thanks for the warning.  now will you tell me how to do it?
2008-04-15T07:32:00.000Z	bazhang	sparr_	you are talking about apt-pinning correct?
2008-04-15T07:32:00.000Z	sparr_	bazhang	yes
2008-04-15T07:35:00.000Z	sparr_	bazhang	ive read them.  they don't go very far, and in some cases are quite out of date
2008-04-15T07:35:00.000Z	bazhang	sparr_	never tried it; dont want a broken machine--sorry not to be of any help in this instance
2008-04-20T20:52:00.000Z	bazhang	sparr_	does not work that way
2008-04-20T20:52:00.000Z	sparr_	bazhang	does not work [the way im looking for]?
2008-04-20T20:52:00.000Z	bazhang	sparr_	indeed not
2008-04-20T20:52:00.000Z	sparr_	bazhang	i could swear ive seen apt showing multiple download progress meters at the same time, without my asking it to
2008-04-20T20:53:00.000Z	bazhang	sparr_	but that is outside your control
2008-04-20T20:53:00.000Z	sparr_	bazhang	:(
2008-04-20T20:54:00.000Z	sparr_	bazhang	so far, in my experience, "outside your control" with apt means "[un/poorly] documented feature"
2008-04-20T20:55:00.000Z	sparr_	bazhang	and the people with the most apt experience are distro snobs  :(
2008-05-10T22:04:00.000Z	bazhang	sparr_	known adobe bug
2008-05-10T22:04:00.000Z	sparr_	bazhang	interesting.  workaround for flash developer?
