2010-03-25T01:02:00.000Z	angel_linuxfreak		I am trying to create a launcher for a python program but I can't figure it out. Here is the command I am using in the launcher. "/home/angel/.config/pystromo/pystromo-remap.py -m default.map" Can someone tell me what I am doing wrong?
2010-03-25T01:02:00.000Z	gasull	angel_linuxfreak	does your program need a terminal?
2010-03-25T01:03:00.000Z	angel_linuxfreak	gasull	I normally start it from terminal but I don't believe it requires one.
2010-03-25T01:03:00.000Z	gasull	angel_linuxfreak	I mean, is the output of the program in the terminal or do you get a new window?
2010-03-25T01:04:00.000Z	angel_linuxfreak	gasull	it's a background program. When I run it from terminal I get output in the terminal window but no new window is created.
2010-03-25T01:06:00.000Z	gasull	angel_linuxfreak	then, in the launcher choose "type: application in terminal" in the drop down menu
2010-03-25T01:07:00.000Z	angel_linuxfreak	gasull	trying that now.
2010-03-25T01:07:00.000Z	gasull	angel_linuxfreak	and the command should be "/home/angel/.config/pystromo/pystromo-remap.py -m default.map"
2010-03-25T01:07:00.000Z	gasull	angel_linuxfreak	or maybe "python /home/angel/.config/pystromo/pystromo-remap.py -m default.map"
2010-03-25T01:08:00.000Z	angel_linuxfreak	gasull	ok trying them now. Getting an error with the first, but the error pertains to a problem with pystromo I need to fix. Not with the launcher. Will let you know as soon as I figure this part out
2010-03-25T01:11:00.000Z	angel_linuxfreak	gasull	This "/home/angel/.config/pystromo/pystromo-remap.py -m /home/angel/.config/pystromo/default.map" Did the trick, with the run in terminal turned out. Thanks for your help. Question though, I would like to turn this into a startup program. There is not an option when creating a startup program to run it in terminal. Might you have any suggestions as to what command I should use to get it to work from startup?
2010-03-25T01:12:00.000Z	gasull	angel_linuxfreak	go to System-> Preferences-> Startup applications
2010-03-25T01:12:00.000Z	angel_linuxfreak	gasull	I am already there, just trying to work out the kinks of the command for the startup addition.
2010-03-25T01:15:00.000Z	gasull	angel_linuxfreak	try with "gnome-terminal -x /home/angel/.config/pystromo/pystromo-remap.py -m default.map"
2010-03-25T01:15:00.000Z	angel_linuxfreak	gasull	what is the -x for>
2010-03-25T01:16:00.000Z	gasull	angel_linuxfreak	means to execute the remainder of the command within the gnome-terminal
2010-03-25T01:16:00.000Z	gasull	angel_linuxfreak	but b/c you're using gnome-terminal, I'm not sure how it will work
2010-03-25T01:17:00.000Z	angel_linuxfreak	gasull	ZykoticK9, ok I am going to go mess with all this information you gave me. thanks a lot for your help guys! :)
2010-03-25T01:17:00.000Z	gasull	angel_linuxfreak	maybe you want to install roxterm.  I love it.  Like gnome-terminal but lighter
2010-03-25T01:17:00.000Z	angel_linuxfreak	gasull	I will check into it
2010-03-25T01:25:00.000Z	angel_linuxfreak	gasull	This "xterm -e(or -x) /home/angel/.config/pystromo/pystromo-remap.py -m /home/angel/.config/pystromo/default.map" worked great. It started up the program like it was supposed to. Now I am just trying to clean up. On the boot it starts the program in an xterm that is visible and won't close. I would like it to run the command in a terminal that doesn't show up. I want it to run in the background basically. Do you have any suggestions?
