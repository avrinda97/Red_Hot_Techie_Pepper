2008-05-17T11:28:00.000Z	cypha		there was one that i heard was very powerful for linux
2008-05-17T11:28:00.000Z	cypha		but it didn't use gnome
2008-05-17T11:28:00.000Z	cypha		used kdm or something
2008-05-17T11:28:00.000Z	cypha		yeahh
2008-05-17T11:28:00.000Z	cypha		i think amarok
2008-05-17T11:28:00.000Z	cypha		that was supposed to be the best i think
2008-05-17T11:28:00.000Z	cypha		it uses something other than gnome, right?
2008-05-17T11:29:00.000Z	cypha		yeah
2008-05-17T11:29:00.000Z	cypha		kde librs
2008-05-17T11:29:00.000Z	cypha		exactly
2008-05-17T11:29:00.000Z	macd	cypha	Rythmbox is pretty nice.
2008-05-17T11:29:00.000Z	cypha	macd	what's it do compared to winamp?
2008-05-17T11:29:00.000Z	macd	cypha	its like osx compared to windows 95.
2008-05-17T11:31:00.000Z	macd	cypha	Rhytmbox
2008-05-17T11:32:00.000Z	macd	cypha	yep 'sudo apt-get install rhythmbox'
2008-05-17T11:33:00.000Z	macd	cypha	and if you want to search for packages, 'apt-cache search name' is your best friend :)
2008-05-17T11:33:00.000Z	macd	cypha	use purge when your never going to use that program again, then it clears config files, data directores, etc.
2008-05-17T11:34:00.000Z	macd	cypha	a lil of both
2008-05-17T11:37:00.000Z	macd	cypha	yeah I guess I could have told you that ;)
2008-05-17T11:39:00.000Z	macd	cypha	just apt-get it.
2008-05-17T11:39:00.000Z	macd	cypha	dont worry apt takes care of all of that, just 'sudo apt-get install amarok' done.
