2006-10-28T10:40:00.000Z	Kannix		Ok, according to the help.ubuntu.com wiki, I should install network-manager-gnome to manage my WLAN connections. However, when I reboot/relog, I get the error: "The NetworkManager applet could not find some required resources. It cannot continue."
2006-10-28T10:40:00.000Z	Kannix		TheNW does not start.
2006-10-28T10:41:00.000Z	Kannix		What am I doing wrong?
2006-10-28T10:41:00.000Z	amnezia	Kannix	 had it too today, then installed some extra things and it was good
2006-10-28T10:41:00.000Z	Kannix	amnezia	can you specify, what "extra things" you installed?
2006-10-28T10:41:00.000Z	amnezia	Kannix	 nm will start working some time, so just keep waiting
2006-10-28T10:41:00.000Z	Kannix	amnezia	??
2006-10-28T10:42:00.000Z	amnezia	Kannix	 no that's the thing, they were totally unrelated packages and I don't know what they were, a lot
2006-10-28T10:42:00.000Z	amnezia	Kannix	 I mean something fixed it, either a reboot, or something else. not sure
2006-10-28T10:42:00.000Z	Kannix	amnezia	Do you mean that I have to wait for it to time out and then work? Or do you mean, I have to wait till a patch becomes available?
2006-10-28T10:42:00.000Z	Kannix	amnezia	A reboot did not do it for me.
2006-10-28T10:43:00.000Z	amnezia	Kannix	  then maybe a shutdown. saw that once
2006-10-28T10:43:00.000Z	amnezia	Kannix	 a reboot didn't work for me neither, but an hour later it started to work
2006-10-28T10:44:00.000Z	Kannix	amnezia	it is a notebook. Maybe I should remove the battery once to completely reset it. But I don't see how that would be more helpful than poking a needle into a Bill Gates doll.
2006-10-28T10:45:00.000Z	amnezia	Kannix	 just leave that battery there. try a shutdown
2006-10-28T10:45:00.000Z	Kannix	amnezia	Done that. Did not help.
2006-10-28T10:45:00.000Z	amnezia	Kannix	 but you could bugreport it anyway, it is surely broken in some way
2006-10-28T10:45:00.000Z	amnezia	Kannix	 maybe a config script, maybe some missing dependency
2006-10-28T10:46:00.000Z	Kannix	amnezia	So basically, I cannot use my WLAN until a patch comes up?
2006-10-28T10:48:00.000Z	amnezia	Kannix	 it might start working like for me
2006-10-28T10:49:00.000Z	Kannix	amnezia	But I have installed all I wanted to install.
