2012-09-22T07:19:00.000Z	jagginess	DarkAceLaptop	maybe it's not ubuntu.. but so many things can cause this
2012-09-22T07:20:00.000Z	DarkAceLaptop	jagginess	well Windows doesn't see it either
2012-09-22T07:20:00.000Z	jagginess	DarkAceLaptop	maybe it's defected ? .. did you try to change the cable, did the usb box come with the drive?
2012-09-22T07:22:00.000Z	DarkAceLaptop	jagginess	I'll try that, might take me a bit to find another cable
2012-09-22T07:22:00.000Z	jagginess	DarkAceLaptop	if you bought the drive separately from the usbbox.. you have to make sure the usbbox can support that drive..
2012-09-22T07:22:00.000Z	jagginess	DarkAceLaptop	the box is usb3? so the computer usb port should be usb3 too
2012-09-22T07:23:00.000Z	jagginess	DarkAceLaptop	if either usb port (box or computer), is actually usb2.. you'll have to see if the usbbox does usb2
2012-09-22T07:23:00.000Z	jagginess	DarkAceLaptop	..
2012-09-22T07:24:00.000Z	jagginess	DarkAceLaptop	so far you never answered my question.. did you buy the drive separately from the usb box?
2012-09-22T07:24:00.000Z	jagginess	DarkAceLaptop	as i said it can be many things.. some usb kits don't come with a drive.
2012-09-22T07:26:00.000Z	jagginess	DarkAceLaptop	sounds like she dropped it :)
2012-09-22T07:26:00.000Z	jagginess	DarkAceLaptop	clunked!!
2012-09-22T07:28:00.000Z	jagginess	DarkAceLaptop	if you break the heads of the drive, there are restoring services that charge a couple hundred dollars -- it's not impossible, just $$ expensive.. (hence why i use raid and networking only)
2012-09-22T07:29:00.000Z	DarkAceLaptop	jagginess	no problem, she said it was nothing too important on it
2012-09-22T07:29:00.000Z	jagginess	DarkAceLaptop	1 tb is heck of alot you can store on it :)
2012-09-22T07:31:00.000Z	jagginess	DarkAceLaptop	just by chance.. it's just possible, the usb box electronics is bad, but not the harddrive inside itself..
2012-09-22T07:31:00.000Z	jagginess	DarkAceLaptop	you'd probably like to look at this possiblity
2012-09-22T07:32:00.000Z	DarkAceLaptop	jagginess	well the light hasn't turned on since I got it
2012-09-22T07:32:00.000Z	jagginess	DarkAceLaptop	doesnt mean the drive inside is bad.. These usb boxes are often contain pluggable sata drives
