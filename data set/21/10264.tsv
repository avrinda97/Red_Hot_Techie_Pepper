2012-09-03T13:10:00.000Z	gordonjcp	jake443	in Linux, you use multiple partitions
2012-09-03T13:10:00.000Z	gordonjcp	jake443	then you only get to have four partitions
2012-09-03T13:11:00.000Z	gordonjcp	jake443	that's not a good idea
2012-09-03T13:11:00.000Z	gordonjcp	jake443	are you using something like an SD card?
2012-09-03T13:12:00.000Z	gordonjcp	jake443	okay, stop a minute; things are very different in Linux from Windows
2012-09-03T13:12:00.000Z	gordonjcp	jake443	you should have as much swap as you have RAM
2012-09-03T13:13:00.000Z	gordonjcp	jake443	stop a minute, what exactly are you trying to do?
2012-09-03T13:13:00.000Z	gordonjcp	jake443	explain it from the beginning
2012-09-03T13:16:00.000Z	gordonjcp	jake443	feel free to go somewhere else, if that's your attitude
2012-09-03T13:17:00.000Z	gordonjcp	jake443	it should still boot *if* swap is the only thing in the extended partition
2012-09-03T13:18:00.000Z	gordonjcp	jake443	the space taken up by the extended partition will be lost
