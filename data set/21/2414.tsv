2009-11-03T22:57:00.000Z	m0smith		hi all
2009-11-03T22:58:00.000Z	m0smith		I am having issues with the network/firefox with 9.10
2009-11-03T22:58:00.000Z	m0smith		Firefox can't find anything but w3m does a good job
2009-11-03T22:58:00.000Z	FCalderon	m0smith	with your network or with firefox? can't be both...
2009-11-03T22:59:00.000Z	FCalderon	m0smith	Have you tried opening a website using it's IP?
2009-11-03T23:00:00.000Z	FCalderon	m0smith	go to http://67.222.129.122 and let me know if you see cPanel's default page
2009-11-03T23:01:00.000Z	FCalderon	m0smith	ok, so you could access a website by entering th IP address, so mostly sure it's a DNS thing
2009-11-03T23:01:00.000Z	FCalderon	m0smith	Open a terminal and type: host ubuntu.com
2009-11-03T23:01:00.000Z	FCalderon	m0smith	and let me know if you get an IP back
2009-11-03T23:02:00.000Z	FCalderon	m0smith	you should get a 91.x IP address
2009-11-03T23:02:00.000Z	FCalderon	m0smith	ok, now if you try to open ubuntu.com in firefox, does it connect and display the website?
2009-11-03T23:06:00.000Z	FCalderon	m0smith	it's ubuntu.com
2009-11-03T23:09:00.000Z	FCalderon	m0smith	Please make sure that you don't have a proxy set up in your firefox preferences
2009-11-03T23:11:00.000Z	FCalderon	m0smith	odd... just to confirm, if you enter the IP address you can connect without a problem, but if you enter a domain name it just doesn't resolve, right?
2009-11-03T23:15:00.000Z	FCalderon	m0smith	well the 404 is pretty normal as maybe they're using name based virtual hosts
2009-11-03T23:16:00.000Z	FCalderon	m0smith	My best bet would be to reinstall firefox as you've already deleted your .mozilla directory, so there are no preferences saved...
2009-11-03T23:22:00.000Z	FCalderon	m0smith	That's why I say it's odd, try running firefox as root and see if you can open any websites
2009-11-03T23:28:00.000Z	FCalderon	m0smith	Are you running nslookup as a regular user or as a super user?
2009-11-03T23:30:00.000Z	FCalderon	m0smith	I'm thinking but can't seem to find a logic solution to your issue
2009-11-04T00:02:00.000Z	FCalderon	m0smith	good to see that you could solve it :)
2009-11-04T00:04:00.000Z	FCalderon	m0smith	Well, I'm downloading the upgrade files to my laptop, so I'll give it a try later
