2011-03-10T12:54:00.000Z	fairuz		hi
2011-03-10T12:54:00.000Z	fairuz		I changed the date using sudo date -s "03/10/2011 08:53:00"
2011-03-10T12:54:00.000Z	fairuz		it changed the date
2011-03-10T12:54:00.000Z	fairuz		but when i reboot , it changes back to old date
2011-03-10T12:55:00.000Z	fairuz		how to make it permanent? =)
2011-03-10T12:55:00.000Z	recognosco	fairuz	is it the date it is changing or timezone or time?
2011-03-10T12:56:00.000Z	fairuz	recognosco	time and date
2011-03-10T12:56:00.000Z	recognosco	fairuz	is your motherboard date/time proper?
2011-03-10T12:56:00.000Z	fairuz	recognosco	I'm running ubuntu on a evaluation board, so no idea about that either
2011-03-10T12:57:00.000Z	fairuz	recognosco	so date -s wont work?
2011-03-10T12:57:00.000Z	recognosco	fairuz	maybe it is being reset to motherboard settings everytime it resets
2011-03-10T12:57:00.000Z	fairuz	recognosco	hmm not good to me
2011-03-10T12:57:00.000Z	recognosco	fairuz	get it to sync with a time server maybe?
2011-03-10T12:58:00.000Z	recognosco	fairuz	and automatically so after you reboot, everytime?
2011-03-10T12:58:00.000Z	fairuz	recognosco	wait i check
2011-03-10T13:01:00.000Z	fairuz	recognosco	its jan 20 2011 13:18 -.-
2011-03-10T13:02:00.000Z	recognosco	fairuz	jan 20?!
2011-03-10T13:02:00.000Z	fairuz	recognosco	yes
2011-03-10T13:02:00.000Z	recognosco	fairuz	i am lost. maybe someone else can help.
2011-03-10T13:03:00.000Z	recognosco	fairuz	but syncing with NTP might be a good idea? did you try that yet?
