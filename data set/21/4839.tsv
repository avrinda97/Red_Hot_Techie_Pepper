2009-10-31T10:37:00.000Z	jbuncher	zedster	ok, I don't have that one.  My intel audio is working though.
2009-10-31T10:38:00.000Z	zedster	jbuncher	can you pastbin me your alsa.conf?
2009-10-31T10:38:00.000Z	jbuncher	zedster	sure, if you tell me where to find it
2009-10-31T10:38:00.000Z	zedster	jbuncher	/etc/modprobe/alsa.conf
2009-10-31T10:39:00.000Z	jbuncher	zedster	 don't have one, do have /etc/modprobe/alsa-base.conf though   Want that one?
2009-10-31T10:40:00.000Z	zedster	jbuncher	yes, my bad
2009-10-31T10:41:00.000Z	jbuncher	zedster	http://paste.ubuntu.com/305677/
2009-10-31T10:42:00.000Z	zedster	jbuncher	do you have pulse audio installed?
2009-10-31T10:43:00.000Z	jbuncher	zedster	yup.
2009-10-31T10:43:00.000Z	zedster	jbuncher	lol, both?
2009-10-31T10:44:00.000Z	jbuncher	zedster	I guess?  this karmic install is an upgrade from a jaunty fresh install, and I haven't really mucked with audio, so whatever should be there should be there
2009-10-31T10:44:00.000Z	zedster	jbuncher	hmm... I did the same things and go nothing :-/
2009-10-31T10:45:00.000Z	jbuncher	zedster	yeah, probably too different of chipsets or something.  I've really enjoyed the "all intel" chipset on this thing, haven't really had an issue with audio/graphics/wireless ever.
2009-10-31T10:45:00.000Z	zedster	jbuncher	ya, dell really messed up when they went with the stac chips
2009-10-31T10:46:00.000Z	jbuncher	zedster	what brand are the stac chips?  I don't think I've heard of them......
2009-10-31T10:48:00.000Z	zedster	jbuncher	stac is an idt holdover, I think they bought someone else and use the chip for a little
2009-10-31T10:50:00.000Z	jbuncher	zedster	ah ok.  I just have the ICH7 family hda intel audio.
