2010-08-03T06:33:00.000Z	Zzeiss		I'm trying to install Ubuntu Netbook 10.04 on a Panasonic Toughbook CF-18.  It gets part way through the install then hangs with a blank screen.  Removing "splash quiet" doesn't help (tho I get to see log msgs till the screen goes blank).  What should I do?
2010-08-03T06:35:00.000Z	KE1HA	Zzeiss	if that's the I8xx seris chipset version, tere isn't a clear solution for it yet.
2010-08-03T06:36:00.000Z	KE1HA	Zzeiss	see i8xx work arounds for possible solutins: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Bugs/Lucidi8xxFreezes
2010-08-03T06:36:00.000Z	Zzeiss	KE1HA	Looking.  Thanks!
2010-08-03T06:53:00.000Z	Zzeiss	KE1HA	Close... but my fail is during initial boot off of the CDROM, so I'm not really able to "edit grub".  I'm trying putting it on the boot line (F6)
2010-08-03T06:54:00.000Z	KE1HA	Zzeiss	I ahve the same problem on my D400, I can't get past Boot. However, 10-10 (Maverick), it does, but there's other issues still, so Im waiting on the release this week I belive to test again.
2010-08-03T06:55:00.000Z	Zzeiss	KE1HA	.. and it still fails, just aftre it starts CUPS.  (yes, I recorded the video with my phone)
2010-08-03T06:56:00.000Z	Zzeiss	KE1HA	Is there any way to tell Ubuntu to install but don't try to start X?
2010-08-03T06:56:00.000Z	KE1HA	Zzeiss	Its annoying, I know, but unfortunately, aside from the workaround I sent you, I know of no other way around it.
2010-08-03T06:57:00.000Z	KE1HA	Zzeiss	Install the server edition, CLI only :-) but that's no good for Desktop obviously.
2010-08-03T06:57:00.000Z	Zzeiss	KE1HA	The workaround doesn't work for me... not on boot from CDRom, which is where I am stuck.
2010-08-03T06:58:00.000Z	Zzeiss	KE1HA	does gthe same bug exist in all 10.04 editions?  Did it exist in 9.10?
2010-08-03T06:58:00.000Z	KE1HA	Zzeiss	Same here, Download the 10-10 maverick ISO, Alfa-2 I think it was, and try that one, It has a later kernal and patches, worth a shot.
2010-08-03T06:58:00.000Z	Zzeiss	KE1HA	Hmmm... how about Fedora?  Same bug?
2010-08-03T06:59:00.000Z	KE1HA	Zzeiss	no idea, I stoppexdd using fedora on Core-4 or so. Also, try 8.04-LTS, that worked well on my D400.
2010-08-03T07:00:00.000Z	KE1HA	Zzeiss	or even up to 9.04, but I prefer the LTS versions for best stability.
2010-08-03T07:00:00.000Z	Zzeiss	KE1HA	Oh, so this is an emergent bug (wasnt in 8.04)...
2010-08-03T07:00:00.000Z	KE1HA	Zzeiss	I had no issues with 8.04 on install or operation.
2010-08-03T07:11:00.000Z	Zzeiss	KE1HA	An older version of Ubuntu (the brown background looks like a bird?  Ibex?  :-) ) seems to boot X just fine.
2010-08-03T07:13:00.000Z	KE1HA	Zzeiss	yes, this bug manifested in a fairly rescent kernel. It's since been resolved at the Dev levels, but not distro levels. 10.10 its fixed Im pretty sure.
2010-08-03T07:38:00.000Z	Zzeiss	KE1HA	Just for the record, Ubuntu 8.10 (Intrepid Ibex) seems to work just fine.  :-)
