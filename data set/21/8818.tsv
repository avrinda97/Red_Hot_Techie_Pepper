2006-01-06T13:00:00.000Z	clintpatty		does anyone have info about how to burn the LiveDVD iso?
2006-01-06T13:01:00.000Z	clintpatty		yeah
2006-01-06T13:01:00.000Z	clintpatty		you'll need lame
2006-01-06T13:02:00.000Z	clintpatty		cool
2006-01-06T13:03:00.000Z	clintpatty		can no one help me burn the Ubuntu iso?
2006-01-06T13:03:00.000Z	crimsun	clintpatty	use gnomebaker or k3b, for instance
2006-01-06T13:03:00.000Z	clintpatty	crimsun	i don't have kde
2006-01-06T13:04:00.000Z	crimsun	clintpatty	that has nothing to do with gnomebaker or k3b.
2006-01-06T13:04:00.000Z	clintpatty	crimsun	kde libs are required for k3b
2006-01-06T13:05:00.000Z	crimsun	clintpatty	kdelibs4c2 != KDE
2006-01-06T13:06:00.000Z	clintpatty	crimsun	also, i can't install gnomebaker because it conflicts with something, cdrecord, i think
2006-01-06T13:09:00.000Z	clintpatty	crimsun	don't know how to burn the iso with Graveman; it was just burn the .iso as a file to the dvd
2006-01-06T13:10:00.000Z	crimsun	clintpatty	the same way you'd burn any other iso using gnomebaker, k3b, graveman, $utilityOfChoice
2006-01-06T13:11:00.000Z	clintpatty	crimsun	i've only used cdrecord from terminal for isos before
2006-01-06T13:11:00.000Z	crimsun	clintpatty	you've never used growisofs directly or graveman to burn dvd isos?
2006-01-06T13:12:00.000Z	crimsun	clintpatty	then just use growisofs
2006-01-06T13:12:00.000Z	clintpatty	crimsun	graveman burns it as a file
2006-01-06T13:13:00.000Z	clintpatty	crimsun	have you used it before to burn DVD iso?
2006-01-06T13:14:00.000Z	crimsun	clintpatty	no, I don't have a cd-rom or a dvd-rom
2006-01-06T13:19:00.000Z	clintpatty	crimsun	I suppose the answer of use the terminal program that graveman works with should have been more obvious to me
2006-01-06T13:19:00.000Z	clintpatty	crimsun	thanks, growisofs is burning it right now
