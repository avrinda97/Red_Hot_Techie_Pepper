2008-06-17T12:24:00.000Z	flaccid		how can i manually re-setup sun-java-6 to work with firefox 2 on ubuntu hardy? it aks me to install the plugin, then returns already installed and java applets never render
2008-06-17T12:25:00.000Z	snarkster	flaccid	Us apt to install java..
2008-06-17T12:25:00.000Z	snarkster	flaccid	Um hehe Use even
2008-06-17T12:25:00.000Z	flaccid	snarkster	already installed and ran update alternatives
2008-06-17T12:26:00.000Z	snarkster	flaccid	reinstall then
2008-06-17T12:26:00.000Z	snarkster	flaccid	What system version?
2008-06-17T12:30:00.000Z	snarkster	flaccid	Ok dude if you open synaptics and do a search for jre what do you?
2008-06-17T12:32:00.000Z	flaccid	snarkster	http://paste.ubuntu.com/20790/
2008-06-17T12:33:00.000Z	flaccid	snarkster	console output shows it wants to use openjdk even though i changed to sun in update-alternatives
2008-06-17T12:33:00.000Z	snarkster	flaccid	then apt-ger purge openjdk
2008-06-17T12:34:00.000Z	flaccid	snarkster	yeah kind of defeats the purpose of this alternatives thing
2008-06-17T12:36:00.000Z	flaccid	snarkster	http://paste.ubuntu.com/20792/
2008-06-17T12:39:00.000Z	flaccid	snarkster	well its removed, stuck in memory somewhow hmm
2008-06-17T12:40:00.000Z	flaccid	snarkster	same thing
2008-06-17T12:41:00.000Z	flaccid	snarkster	did that before..
2008-06-17T12:41:00.000Z	snarkster	flaccid	soemtimes needs a restart, not often tho
2008-06-17T12:42:00.000Z	flaccid	snarkster	thus the curiosity factor
2008-06-17T13:30:00.000Z	flaccid	snarkster	i think we need to find out what firefox actually needs for sun java
2008-06-17T13:30:00.000Z	snarkster	flaccid	WB dude
2008-06-17T13:31:00.000Z	flaccid	snarkster	it appears to require gcjwebplugin , it will ask for it no matter what
2008-06-17T13:31:00.000Z	flaccid	snarkster	done that
