2006-09-01T11:52:00.000Z	zeronenorez		and ERROR: Please edit the example config file /usr/local/etc/clamd.conf.
2006-09-01T11:52:00.000Z	zeronenorez		and ERROR: Can't parse the config file /usr/local/etc/clamd.conf
2006-09-01T11:52:00.000Z	cafuego	zeronenorez	Um, just 'apt-get install' it.
2006-09-01T11:52:00.000Z	cafuego	zeronenorez	Whya r you mucking about with tarballs?
2006-09-01T11:55:00.000Z	zeronenorez	cafuego	apt-get only can get clamav 0.88.2
2006-09-01T11:55:00.000Z	cafuego	zeronenorez	and...?
2006-09-01T11:55:00.000Z	zeronenorez	cafuego	i install it
2006-09-01T11:58:00.000Z	cafuego	zeronenorez	Works fine here.
2006-09-01T11:58:00.000Z	cafuego	zeronenorez	it prints two warninsg that you cna ignore, but it works fine.
2006-09-01T11:59:00.000Z	zeronenorez	cafuego	really? the warning is normal?
2006-09-01T11:59:00.000Z	cafuego	zeronenorez	Yes.
2006-09-01T11:59:00.000Z	zeronenorez	cafuego	but now i'm in 0.88.4 can u give me any suggestion?
2006-09-01T11:59:00.000Z	cafuego	zeronenorez	Remove 0.88.4 completely. Just run the packaged one and let it run the freshclam server normally.
2006-09-01T12:00:00.000Z	zeronenorez	cafuego	i done , it give me 3 errors:ERROR: Please edit the example config file /usr/local/etc/freshclam.conf.
2006-09-01T12:01:00.000Z	cafuego	zeronenorez	That is not the Ubuntu 0.88.2 version.
2006-09-01T12:02:00.000Z	cafuego	zeronenorez	I mean not the version that is packaged in Ubuntu; it's trying to run the one you installed by hand from the tarball.
2006-09-01T12:03:00.000Z	cafuego	zeronenorez	Yes
2006-09-01T12:07:00.000Z	cafuego	zeronenorez	That's the thing with tarball stuff, you can't easily uninstall it. that's why you don't install it unless you have no choice.
2006-09-01T12:08:00.000Z	zeronenorez	cafuego	please give me some suggestion :<
2006-09-01T12:13:00.000Z	zeronenorez	cafuego	thx
