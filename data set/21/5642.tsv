2008-03-05T01:45:00.000Z	Ward1983		?
2008-03-05T01:45:00.000Z	mammoth	Ward1983	: You can use the livecd to repare something or to add some piece of softwares/tools.
2008-03-05T01:46:00.000Z	mammoth	Ward1983	: but, if you don't have linux installed, what do you want to install ?
2008-03-05T01:46:00.000Z	Ward1983	mammoth	it just says: boot the ubuntu cd qnd install dmraid from synaptic
2008-03-05T01:47:00.000Z	Ward1983	mammoth	im gonna install winxp first, then ubuntu, qnd multiboot them
2008-03-05T01:47:00.000Z	mammoth	Ward1983	: Ok, it's a good way.
2008-03-05T01:48:00.000Z	Ward1983	mammoth	but... should i mqke two arrays, eqch using hqlf of the disk, or one array and partition it?
2008-03-05T01:48:00.000Z	Ward1983	mammoth	please ignore my retarded typos, im used to qwerty these dqys, qnd im qt q azerty keyb
2008-03-05T01:50:00.000Z	mammoth	Ward1983	: i suggest you to only use one disk, and then (after the install of the two systems, when you have your double boot worked) add the second disk and configure the raid.
2008-03-05T01:51:00.000Z	Ward1983	mammoth	but if i install on one disk how cqn i then turn it into raid? are you sure this is possible? im extremely confused now
2008-03-05T01:52:00.000Z	mammoth	Ward1983	: i never use raid technology, but i think that it is the best way. you can make some searchs before doing your installs.
2008-03-05T01:56:00.000Z	Ward1983	mammoth	never mind i made up my mind, im just gonnq use rqid on windows only, i read the tutorial and its too much work
