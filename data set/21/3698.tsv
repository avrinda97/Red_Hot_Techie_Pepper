2008-12-14T01:31:00.000Z	kitche	\Kira	can you chnge your nic since just typing your name won't work
2008-12-14T01:31:00.000Z	\Kira	kitche	?
2008-12-14T01:33:00.000Z	\Kira	kitche	well, kira is already taken. And the slash for command is the other way. Sorry, but I like this name :)
2008-12-14T01:33:00.000Z	kitche	\Kira	umm slash is both ways
2008-12-14T01:34:00.000Z	\Kira	kitche	opps, sorry, then.... I dont really want to register a new nic and stuff.
2008-12-14T01:35:00.000Z	\Kira	kitche	okay then.......
2008-12-14T04:44:00.000Z	kitche	\Kira	hmm much better now I m not on my Windows machine right now :)
2008-12-14T04:45:00.000Z	\Kira	kitche	lol
2008-12-14T04:45:00.000Z	\Kira	kitche	you mean the thing with my name, earlier, right?
2008-12-14T04:46:00.000Z	kitche	\Kira	yes seems like the script I was using in mirc has a \ to look at the logs
2008-12-14T04:47:00.000Z	\Kira	kitche	I see. Well, glad your not mad at my anymore :D
2008-12-29T01:26:00.000Z	kitche	\Kira	sounds like your refresh rate is set incorrectly
2008-12-29T01:26:00.000Z	\Kira	kitche	how would I fix this?
2008-12-29T01:27:00.000Z	kitche	\Kira	by changing the refresh rate to a number that you don't notice that happening on
2008-12-29T01:27:00.000Z	\Kira	kitche	how would I change my refresh rate, though? Im running kubunut if that matters
2008-12-29T01:27:00.000Z	kitche	\Kira	the same way you change the resolution
2008-12-29T01:28:00.000Z	\Kira	kitche	oh, opps. Thanks :)
2008-12-30T04:53:00.000Z	kitche	\Kira	nope 8.10 is
2008-12-30T04:53:00.000Z	\Kira	kitche	damn, what is 8.04?
