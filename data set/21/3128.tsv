2009-03-27T16:10:00.000Z	ishmaela		anyone know why I can't open urls that start with an underscore?
2009-03-27T16:11:00.000Z	ishmaela		i can do this on my windows box but not on my ubuntu machince
2009-03-27T16:11:00.000Z	oCean_	ishmaela	do you have an example? URL's normally don't start with underscore
2009-03-27T16:12:00.000Z	ishmaela	oCean_	I have a dev server that starts the url's with an underscore
2009-03-27T16:13:00.000Z	oCean_	ishmaela	like what?
2009-03-27T16:19:00.000Z	oCean_	ishmaela	ah, I see. I think it is actually allowed for subdomains to start with numbers, hyphen and even underscore
2009-03-27T16:19:00.000Z	oCean_	ishmaela	what is the error message?
2009-03-27T16:20:00.000Z	oCean_	ishmaela	it just cannot resolve the subdomain. Can you ping the testing.ourdomain.com server? Or even better, can you reach subdomains that do not start with underscore?
2009-03-27T16:20:00.000Z	ishmaela	oCean_	you think I have to add an entry to my host file?
2009-03-27T16:21:00.000Z	oCean_	ishmaela	that might be necessary. Test if you can ping the machine. (not the subdomain, because the webserver is 'serving' the subdomain)
2009-03-27T16:22:00.000Z	oCean_	ishmaela	hmm..
2009-03-27T16:23:00.000Z	oCean_	ishmaela	ok, so you may want to try to add the full info to /etc/hosts
2009-03-27T16:27:00.000Z	ishmaela	oCean_	that works, but there are potentially hundreds of sites that have that url format in our testing environment
2009-03-27T16:29:00.000Z	ishmaela	oCean_	I think I need to talk to our admins, to figure out why those are not resolving
2009-03-27T16:29:00.000Z	oCean_	ishmaela	yeah, I don't understand.
2009-03-27T16:29:00.000Z	oCean_	ishmaela	I *think* they should resolve..
2009-03-27T16:32:00.000Z	ishmaela	oCean_	and it just seem to be my linux box that is coughing at them, the windows and macs have no problems
2009-03-27T16:32:00.000Z	oCean_	ishmaela	that's a clue. There must be something that prevents linux to resolve. Maybe google knows something about that?
2009-03-27T16:33:00.000Z	ishmaela	oCean_	it's be hard to formulate a search string that returns anything useful
2009-03-27T16:33:00.000Z	oCean_	ishmaela	true. Something like "resolving subdomain underscore" maybe
2009-03-27T16:33:00.000Z	oCean_	ishmaela	comes up with this http://domainkeys.sourceforge.net/underscore.html
