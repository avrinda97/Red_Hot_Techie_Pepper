2007-12-28T14:20:00.000Z	ReaperWitobi		I feel so incompetent, but does anyone know a way I can go about developing PHP webpages on my laptop?
2007-12-28T14:22:00.000Z	Wander_w	ReaperWitobi	Install apache, apache-php and mysql and start reading some php tutorials
2007-12-28T14:23:00.000Z	ReaperWitobi	Wander_w	 I've tried all that, but even the simplest PHP scripts are screwy
2007-12-28T14:23:00.000Z	Wander_w	ReaperWitobi	try this simple php page as an example: <?php echo "Hello World!" ?>
2007-12-28T14:24:00.000Z	Wander_w	ReaperWitobi	please define "screwy"
2007-12-28T14:28:00.000Z	Wander_w	ReaperWitobi	How are you trying to run the php script?
2007-12-28T14:29:00.000Z	Wander_w	ReaperWitobi	how did you save the script? What's the filename?
2007-12-28T14:31:00.000Z	Wander_w	ReaperWitobi	where did you put it?
2007-12-28T14:34:00.000Z	Wander_w	ReaperWitobi	it should go in ~/public_html or somewhere in /var/www/ and then you should access it using a web browser
2007-12-28T14:34:00.000Z	Wander_w	ReaperWitobi	like: http://localhost/~youusername/123.php
2007-12-28T14:36:00.000Z	Wander_w	ReaperWitobi	hmm... strange
2007-12-28T14:36:00.000Z	Wander_w	ReaperWitobi	Did you install all the apache-php stuff?
2007-12-28T14:37:00.000Z	Wander_w	ReaperWitobi	maybe try the commandline version of php and then type on the commandline: php 123.php
2007-12-28T14:39:00.000Z	Wander_w	ReaperWitobi	I think you need libapache2-mod-php5
2007-12-28T14:40:00.000Z	Wander_w	ReaperWitobi	have you installed libapache2-mod-php5? is it enabled in the apache configuration?
2007-12-28T14:47:00.000Z	Wander_w	ReaperWitobi	there should be a symbolic link to a php config file in /etc/apache2/mods-enabled
2007-12-28T14:56:00.000Z	Wander_w	ReaperWitobi	uhm.. php3 is OLD I'd delete it (apt-get remove --purge php3) if I were you
2007-12-28T14:57:00.000Z	Wander_w	ReaperWitobi	hehe, ok
2007-12-28T14:57:00.000Z	Wander_w	ReaperWitobi	uhm.. then try this as a script: <?php phpinfo(); ?>
2007-12-28T15:09:00.000Z	Wander_w	ReaperWitobi	then it's pretty safe to say that you php configuration is fubarred
2007-12-28T15:10:00.000Z	Wander_w	ReaperWitobi	I can't tell from over here what exactly is wrong, but you might try reinstalling apache and php
