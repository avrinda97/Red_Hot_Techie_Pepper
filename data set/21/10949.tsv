2010-02-23T19:57:00.000Z	king_pin		but I just bought a brand spanking new dell, what is a good utility to double check
2010-02-23T19:57:00.000Z	king_pin		i have tried so many and yet it says everything is fine

2010-02-23T20:00:00.000Z	king_pin		run that command in terminal? I am a total noob
2010-02-23T20:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	king_pin	 is it a warning about the smart tool in ubuntu you are refering to?
2010-02-23T20:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	king_pin	 I find that tool to be a little bit - overzelous in its warnings.
2010-02-23T20:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	king_pin	 so take the warnings as a warning.. not as a impending doom.. but always have backups
2010-02-23T20:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	king_pin	 Mine gives me a warnign because i have like 1 over the 'limit' of what it says is ok.. but the seagate tools scan and say the drive is fine. Just rember that hard drives are basically the least reliable part of a PC these days
2010-02-23T20:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	king_pin	 i ran it on windows. no idea if they got a linux port.. proberly they dont
2010-02-23T20:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	king_pin	 i miss my AMIGA i had in college...
2010-02-23T20:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	king_pin	 you dont fsck a mounted filesystem
2010-02-23T20:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	king_pin	 i always use live cd's if i need to fsck stuff. or let it auto fsck
2010-02-23T20:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	king_pin	  woopdee dooo.. ubuntu is just saying it has X # of bad blocks which is over the # it considers safe.. igniore the warning if you want
2010-02-23T20:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	king_pin	 seagate MIGHT be saying its ok.. because they dont want to have it returned under warrenty.. think about that also
2010-02-23T20:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	king_pin	 if data is worth having.. its worth BACKING UP..
2010-02-23T20:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	king_pin	 i used the segate tools and let it do a DEEP scan/check of my 1.5 tb hd.. it took the tools about 2 days to do the test.
2010-02-23T20:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	king_pin	 the 'smart' check is just looking at the smart #'s the SMART stuff is reporting.. thats not doing a lot.
