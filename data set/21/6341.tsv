2010-01-20T20:47:00.000Z	llutz		you always can additional swap-space on the fly
2010-01-20T20:49:00.000Z	llutz		if one uses swap on regular base, he should buy ram
2010-01-20T20:49:00.000Z	airtonix	llutz	hibernation ?
2010-01-20T20:50:00.000Z	llutz	airtonix	that's not "using swap", thats hibernating to swap-partition
2010-01-20T20:50:00.000Z	airtonix	llutz	no swap == no hibernate
2010-01-20T20:50:00.000Z	llutz	airtonix	i meant "usind swap as memory paging"
2010-02-07T13:52:00.000Z	llutz	airtonix	it's called bridging
2010-02-07T13:53:00.000Z	airtonix	llutz	you understand what z3r0-0n3 wants? i thought bridging was something else slightly different
2010-02-07T13:54:00.000Z	llutz	airtonix	for me it sounds liek bridging, i'm just not sure about the "switch connection" part
2010-06-02T17:11:00.000Z	airtonix	llutz	would swap file work for hibernation instead of a partition ?
2010-06-02T17:16:00.000Z	llutz	airtonix	afaik only tuxonice can hibernate to swap-files, all other methods need a partition
2010-06-11T23:10:00.000Z	airtonix	llutz	really needs to have a short python gui to setup the nat that UFW allows for
2010-06-11T23:11:00.000Z	airtonix	llutz	http://www.nowhere.dk/articles/tip_nat_with_ubuntus_ufw_firewall
2010-06-11T23:11:00.000Z	llutz	airtonix	i just gave the link, i don't need ics
2010-06-11T23:12:00.000Z	airtonix	llutz	i understand this, im just passing it on out of 'wierd unrelated topic guy"
2010-06-11T23:12:00.000Z	llutz	airtonix	the manual way with iptables should still do , won't it?
2010-06-11T23:13:00.000Z	airtonix	llutz	most likely, but since UFW is the standard firewall for ubuntu I just thought it would be nice if there was a gui to do what that page describes... firestarter can cause some issues
2010-07-23T16:58:00.000Z	llutz	airtonix	works fine here
2010-07-23T17:00:00.000Z	airtonix	llutz	if i need someone to look at setup info ( in regards to why a bridged virtualbox can not ping wan domain names) is resolv.conf, route, ifconfig enough ?
2011-04-27T18:28:00.000Z	llutz	airtonix	sudo -k
2011-12-09T23:47:00.000Z	llutz	airtonix	[19:35:01] <sskalnik> webnet:  I think you are talking about switching out the running kernel - a hot swap type of operation
