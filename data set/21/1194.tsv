2011-01-01T17:53:00.000Z	toiletduck		was wondering if anyone here has any knowledge of WUBI???
2011-01-01T17:54:00.000Z	toiletduck		ive used it before
2011-01-01T17:55:00.000Z	toiletduck		but i had to format my hard drive and now my system asks if i want to boot win or ubuntu at start up even though ubuntu is no longer on my system
2011-01-01T17:55:00.000Z	toiletduck		and thats the part im trying to fix
2011-01-01T17:56:00.000Z	toiletduck		was just wondering if anyone else here knew about it
2011-01-01T17:58:00.000Z	toiletduck		when i turn my netbook on it asks me if i want to boot window 7 or ubuntu
2011-01-01T17:58:00.000Z	toiletduck		the problem being is that Ubuntu is not installed!
2011-01-01T17:58:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	toiletduck	thats normal
2011-01-01T17:58:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	toiletduck	you are confusing two different things
2011-01-01T17:59:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	toiletduck	what you are seeing is grub, it is a boot manager
2011-01-01T18:00:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	toiletduck	basically you need to remove grub from the mbr and install the default windows mbr
2011-01-01T18:01:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	toiletduck	never done it myself, need to use a windows partition management tool
2011-01-01T18:01:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	toiletduck	windows itself wont do it
2011-01-01T18:02:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	toiletduck	remove ubuntu grub windows mbr
2011-01-01T18:08:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	toiletduck	means the mbr hasnt been reoplaced
2011-01-01T18:09:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	toiletduck	usually I replace the mbr from within linux'
2011-01-01T18:09:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	toiletduck	no'
