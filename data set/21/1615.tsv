2010-07-04T22:37:00.000Z	AhmedBH		Well seems if i am wasting the downloading usage by downloading something like that then :P i have tried wine by the way

2010-07-04T22:37:00.000Z	AhmedBH		ooh thanks
2010-07-04T22:37:00.000Z	ImaLamer	AhmedBH	i don't think the problems are wine...
2010-07-04T22:39:00.000Z	ImaLamer	AhmedBH	you are trying to fix a problem that doesn't exist :)
2010-07-04T22:40:00.000Z	ImaLamer	AhmedBH	running safari though wine is silly when you can natively run Chrome is all :)
2010-07-04T22:41:00.000Z	AhmedBH	ImaLamer	Yes well but Java doesnt works so WELL on it so i use Firefox 3.6.6 i gues
2010-07-04T22:41:00.000Z	ImaLamer	AhmedBH	no java problems in chrome here :/
2010-07-04T22:43:00.000Z	AhmedBH	ImaLamer	I dont know why i have issue with a flash player all the time over youtube, i cant even play stop or volume doesnt work ! i mean on some videos it does on like HD usually others it doesnt or lets say old ones, why ? i am on x64 by the way Lucid
2010-07-04T22:44:00.000Z	ImaLamer	AhmedBH	I should be clear and say I use Sun's Java and not open Java - thought I hear compiz + emerald mess with the play buttons
2010-07-04T22:46:00.000Z	ImaLamer	AhmedBH	I don't get why you have gone that far...
2010-07-04T22:46:00.000Z	ImaLamer	AhmedBH	Suns' Java + official flash + chrome has worked fine
2010-07-04T22:49:00.000Z	ImaLamer	AhmedBH	all flash players or certain ones? (Chrome + YouTube should not use flash at all btw)
2010-07-04T22:50:00.000Z	ImaLamer	AhmedBH	Chrome is using HTML5
2010-07-04T22:51:00.000Z	ImaLamer	AhmedBH	is NOT having problems with Flash - Chrome is NOT using flash for YouTube
