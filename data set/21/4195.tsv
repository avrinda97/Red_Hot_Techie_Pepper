2008-07-15T00:47:00.000Z	Xavura		Is there any way to get the mouse cursor automatically position itself above the default choice (button) on any dialogues that open?
2008-07-15T00:47:00.000Z	Xavura		I had it like that no Windows with some add-on or another
2008-07-15T00:47:00.000Z	Xavura		So say if my mouse is at the bottom left of the screen and a dialogue opens in the center, my mouse pointer will move onto the default button for that dialogue (could be Yes, No or whatever)
2008-07-15T00:47:00.000Z	Xavura		on it's own
