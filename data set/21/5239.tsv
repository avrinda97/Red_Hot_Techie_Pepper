2012-10-14T19:40:00.000Z	michealPW		Maybe I can try installing XScreenSaver and removing this garbage  screensaver that comes with Ubuntu? :\
2012-10-14T19:40:00.000Z	gordonjcp	michealPW	you could just try disabling the screensaver
2012-10-14T19:41:00.000Z	gordonjcp	michealPW	they're not embedding ads in the search results
2012-10-14T19:42:00.000Z	gordonjcp	michealPW	no, but Jeff_Bezos might
2012-10-14T19:42:00.000Z	gordonjcp	michealPW	however, it's in 12.10 which is #ubuntu+1
2012-10-14T19:42:00.000Z	gordonjcp	michealPW	or if you feel inclined, #ubuntu-offtopic
2012-10-14T19:42:00.000Z	gordonjcp	michealPW	by default Unity uses *all* the lenses
2012-10-14T19:44:00.000Z	gordonjcp	michealPW	oh well, enjoy paying for Ubuntu then
2012-10-14T19:44:00.000Z	gordonjcp	michealPW	what, the screensaver kicking in?  Just disable it
2012-10-15T21:06:00.000Z	gordonjcp	michealPW	?
2012-10-15T21:06:00.000Z	gordonjcp	michealPW	what's weird about it?
2012-10-15T21:07:00.000Z	gordonjcp	michealPW	it's pretty much a complete userland for a small Linux system, in a single binary
2012-10-15T21:07:00.000Z	gordonjcp	michealPW	the really groovy thing is you can configure it to only have what you want
2012-10-15T21:14:00.000Z	gordonjcp	michealPW	yes
2012-10-15T21:14:00.000Z	gordonjcp	michealPW	if you're feeling hardcore, take a look at buildroot
2012-10-15T21:15:00.000Z	gordonjcp	michealPW	that lets you cross-build a toolchain, a kernel, uclibc and busybox for a whole bunch of platforms - I've got one I built for a very specific i486-based machine
2012-10-15T21:15:00.000Z	gordonjcp	michealPW	the kernel is about 4M and the rootfs is about 30M
2012-10-15T21:17:00.000Z	gordonjcp	michealPW	yup
2012-10-15T21:17:00.000Z	gordonjcp	michealPW	everyone you talk to who says they don't use Linux - they do if they have a wireless access point, or ADSL modem, or cable modem...
2012-10-15T21:20:00.000Z	michealPW	gordonjcp	haha, touche :)
2012-10-16T18:00:00.000Z	gordonjcp	michealPW	"it's new and I don't like it" isn't a support issue
