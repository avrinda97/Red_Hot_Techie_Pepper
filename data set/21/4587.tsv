2008-04-02T19:31:00.000Z	jaffarkelshac		Vixen what version are you on
2008-04-02T19:32:00.000Z	Vixen_	jaffarkelshac	I'm on 6.10
2008-04-02T19:32:00.000Z	jaffarkelshac	Vixen_	use "sudo aptitude search irc" should find irc programs you have in repository
2008-04-02T19:33:00.000Z	Vixen_	jaffarkelshac	Ok, will do
2008-04-02T19:34:00.000Z	Vixen_	jaffarkelshac	Aye, LIRC apparently
2008-04-02T19:37:00.000Z	Vixen_	jaffarkelshac	I've sorted it, sorry for wasting your time >.>
2008-04-02T19:38:00.000Z	jaffarkelshac	Vixen_	check this out to familiarise yourself http://monkeyblog.org/ubuntu/installing/
2008-04-02T19:42:00.000Z	jaffarkelshac	Vixen_	what problems are you having using it
2008-04-02T19:46:00.000Z	jaffarkelshac	Vixen_	another link i read when i switched. http://strabes.wordpress.com/useful-links-for-ubuntu-beginners/
2008-04-02T19:46:00.000Z	Vixen_	jaffarkelshac	Thanks, I'll take a look
2008-04-02T20:01:00.000Z	jaffarkelshac	Vixen_	you can only install one instance at a time, but when installing and you know all the packages, you just add them on ie "sudo aptitude install vlc xchat seahorse......." and so on
2008-04-02T20:02:00.000Z	Vixen_	jaffarkelshac	Ah, I followed the link you gave me, just installing some rythmbox codecs
2008-04-02T20:03:00.000Z	jaffarkelshac	Vixen_	mp3 was the most annoying thing when i switched, used vlc for everything till i got amarok working
2008-04-02T20:04:00.000Z	Vixen_	jaffarkelshac	Mmm, I'm hoping it won't take long to get mp3s supported on my PC, since I just found that ubuntu can read the windows filesystem, so I still have all my tunes
2008-04-02T20:05:00.000Z	jaffarkelshac	Vixen_	so you have not mounted any of your drives yet?
2008-04-02T20:06:00.000Z	Vixen_	jaffarkelshac	Uh, got to be honest, I'm not even entirely sure what that is. I'm running ubuntu on an external HD, and I made a windows backup partition on the same dick. After putting all my backup files on the windows partition, I booted ubuntu, and found that I could access the files in both OS
2008-04-02T20:09:00.000Z	jaffarkelshac	Vixen_	 then you are ok, the partitions auto mounted. mine are ntfs and can be tricky sometimes, it does not show up so i have to mount it myself. ie make it appear in my "my computer section"
2008-04-02T20:09:00.000Z	Vixen_	jaffarkelshac	Ah right, mount = make readable
2008-04-02T20:10:00.000Z	jaffarkelshac	Vixen_	pretty much
2008-04-02T20:11:00.000Z	Vixen_	jaffarkelshac	Oh yeah, mp3s are working ;]  Cheers for that link
2008-04-02T20:12:00.000Z	jaffarkelshac	Vixen_	its all good
