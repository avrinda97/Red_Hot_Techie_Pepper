2009-03-31T11:41:00.000Z	spc_		can anyone think of why it takes so long for me to be able to access a windows network (windows PC)? (i'm on wireless) from ubuntu..
2009-03-31T11:42:00.000Z	spc_		it's usually about 10 minutes at least
2009-03-31T11:42:00.000Z	gogeta	spc_	try changing channels if wireless is slow
2009-03-31T11:43:00.000Z	spc_	gogeta	actually the wireless is fine.. the internet is fast too.. it's just accessing shared files from a windows pc it won't see anything for at least 10 or more minutes.
2009-03-31T11:43:00.000Z	gogeta	spc_	type the ip manuly in windows
2009-03-31T11:44:00.000Z	gogeta	spc_	like //192.168.1.1
2009-03-31T11:45:00.000Z	spc_	gogeta	i will try that.. good idea..
2009-03-31T11:45:00.000Z	gogeta	spc_	works for my
2009-03-31T11:49:00.000Z	spc_	gogeta	yeah that seems to work.. i wonder why that is..   just out of curiosity.. since most of my computers are on wireless.. do you know how to make sure when a computer is rebooted my router will give it the same ip address instead of a new one?
2009-03-31T11:50:00.000Z	gogeta	spc_	set a static ip to iy
2009-03-31T11:50:00.000Z	gogeta	spc_	but as long as its the same mac the roughter shoudent change it
2009-03-31T11:51:00.000Z	spc_	gogeta	do i do that through the router, through the computer or both?
2009-03-31T11:52:00.000Z	gogeta	spc_	roughter
2009-03-31T11:53:00.000Z	gogeta	spc_	as i said it should not chnage anyways
2009-03-31T11:54:00.000Z	spc_	gogeta	yeah it seems to change.. at least i believe it does.. thanks for the help!
2009-03-31T11:54:00.000Z	gogeta	spc_	roughter should only assine new ips if something changes
2009-03-31T11:58:00.000Z	spc_	gogeta	i will keep an eye on them.. but i could of sworn that they seem to change.. they all float between xxx.xxx.x.101 and xxx.xxx.x.111
2009-03-31T11:59:00.000Z	gogeta	spc_	well you can set em to keep there ips on the roughter lease settings
2009-03-31T12:01:00.000Z	spc_	gogeta	thanks.. i will look into that.. i assume there is a way to keep the 'lease' forever or something.
2009-03-31T12:01:00.000Z	gogeta	spc_	yea years at least
2009-03-31T12:06:00.000Z	spc_	gogeta	thanks i will look into that!
