2007-12-21T17:49:00.000Z	windego40		hello
2007-12-21T17:49:00.000Z	windego40		anyone know how i can input the "nonempty" mount option?
2007-12-21T17:51:00.000Z	g00se	windego40	-o nonempty ?
2007-12-21T17:55:00.000Z	g00se	windego40	you need to find out what iphone-mount does
2007-12-21T18:00:00.000Z	g00se	windego40	can't you mount it somewhere that *is* empty?
2007-12-21T18:02:00.000Z	g00se	windego40	mount
2007-12-21T18:03:00.000Z	windego40	g00se	dunno what to make of it
2007-12-21T18:05:00.000Z	g00se	windego40	Where are you at now
2007-12-21T18:11:00.000Z	g00se	windego40	According to those docs you should be mounting with sshfs
2007-12-21T18:12:00.000Z	windego40	g00se	i just tried it using sshfs but still says mount point isnt empty
2007-12-21T18:13:00.000Z	g00se	windego40	Why not empty it then?
2007-12-21T18:14:00.000Z	windego40	g00se	i dont know what point im supposed to empty
2007-12-21T18:14:00.000Z	g00se	windego40	What  sshfs are you issuing?
2007-12-21T18:15:00.000Z	g00se	windego40	i.e. what sshfs command are you issuing?
2007-12-21T18:15:00.000Z	windego40	g00se	its at /var/root/Media/ /media/ipod
2007-12-21T18:16:00.000Z	g00se	windego40	Try emptying /media/ipod (Backup first if you need stuff in it)
2007-12-21T18:18:00.000Z	windego40	g00se	hmmm it looks like the folders has the things fromy my ipod but i dont see it mounted on my comp
2007-12-21T18:19:00.000Z	windego40	g00se	think a reboot will remove the mount?
2007-12-21T18:20:00.000Z	g00se	windego40	Yes
2007-12-21T18:20:00.000Z	windego40	g00se	brb
2007-12-21T18:20:00.000Z	g00se	windego40	Anyway it looks like it's mounted - isn't that the objective?
