2011-10-12T04:24:00.000Z	spreadneck205		does anyone know how i can get an asus usb n13 wireless adapter to work for 11.04? i have the installation disk but im not sure how to use the files provided...
2011-10-12T04:24:00.000Z	reisio	spreadneck205	does it say 'Linux' on the disc? :p
2011-10-12T04:25:00.000Z	reisio		text in the menu
2011-10-12T04:26:00.000Z	spreadneck205		it is compatible, there is a folder titled "linux" i extracted the files, but i cant understand how to install the driver.... the readme is over my head
2011-10-12T04:27:00.000Z	reisio	spreadneck205	it's be pretty surprising if you don't already have the driver available to modprobe
2011-10-12T04:27:00.000Z	reisio	spreadneck205	maybe rt2800usb
2011-10-12T04:28:00.000Z	spreadneck205	reisio	im not sure what you mean
2011-10-12T04:28:00.000Z	reisio		I mean when there are drivers for things, they're added to the kernel, you don't have to rely on random install discs

2011-10-12T04:30:00.000Z	spreadneck205	reisio	ok, ill try that.. it says something about n-band not working? thats the only reason i would need the driver
2011-10-12T04:30:00.000Z	reisio	spreadneck205	n _speed_ is what I remember reading
2011-10-12T04:30:00.000Z	reisio		for a particular version
2011-10-12T04:31:00.000Z	reisio		so it might not give you as fast a connection as it is physically able to, because of the driver, but it'll work
2011-10-12T04:31:00.000Z	reisio		GNOME is pretty enormous even without that stuff
2011-10-12T04:31:00.000Z	spreadneck205	reisio	right, im using my internal wifi right now... i just got this so i would get faster internet... works awesome iin windows, but if it wont give me better speeds than b/g then i can just use the one im on now
2011-10-12T04:32:00.000Z	reisio	spreadneck205	well check
2011-10-12T04:32:00.000Z	spreadneck205	reisio	ok thanks
2011-10-12T04:32:00.000Z	reisio	spreadneck205	if it doesn't, what I'd do is check for a newer version that does
2011-10-12T04:32:00.000Z	spreadneck205		ok cool
2011-10-12T04:32:00.000Z	reisio	spreadneck205	or if both those drivers work for it, perhaps try the other one
2011-10-12T04:33:00.000Z	spreadneck205	reisio	same here, thanks for yo help
