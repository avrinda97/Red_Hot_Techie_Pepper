2009-05-05T16:34:00.000Z	mater		i have ubuntu installed but i am currently running windows. i need to replace the primary loader cause it is infected, can someone help me out on this?
2009-05-05T16:35:00.000Z	mater		my box got rooted and is totally infected
2009-05-05T16:35:00.000Z	Radtoo	mater	You mean your boot sector also got overwritten?
2009-05-05T16:36:00.000Z	Radtoo	mater	it's ... in ubuntu as well?
2009-05-05T16:36:00.000Z	Radtoo	mater	okay, so its a windows virus that just did it's best to annoy without destroying random data on the hdd.
2009-05-05T16:37:00.000Z	Radtoo	mater	In that case, reinstall grub, and you might need to run fixmbr using a windows cd as well (or wipe/reinstall windows).
2009-05-05T16:38:00.000Z	Radtoo	mater	ehm... you mean its not installed yet?
2009-05-05T16:38:00.000Z	mater	Radtoo	correct. it did not actually destoy anything yet, it is basically an open proxy to some funky operation of enlarge your peanus type
2009-05-05T16:38:00.000Z	Radtoo	mater	annoying enough but yes then you can be almost certain it wasn't doing anything at all to any linux which was installed.
2009-05-05T16:39:00.000Z	mater	Radtoo	ubuntu is installed but i installed winxp sp3 and never booted ubuntu after that
2009-05-05T16:39:00.000Z	Radtoo	mater	okay. that makes it clear. well, you might actually want to just install a newer version of ubuntu now if one came out in the meantime ;)
2009-05-05T16:40:00.000Z	Radtoo	mater	But failing that, just boot the old ubuntu cd and do http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=24113
2009-05-05T16:42:00.000Z	mater	Radtoo	i tried to boot from old ubuntu, but my primary loader is bad
2009-05-05T16:42:00.000Z	Radtoo	mater	using the cd is the imperative here
2009-05-05T16:43:00.000Z	Radtoo	mater	you'll have to boot off the cd to fix the loader.
2009-05-05T16:44:00.000Z	mater	Radtoo	i am trying to boot from ubuntu cd and thought i could do a reinstall, but it wants to repartition my drives, or else quit
2009-05-05T16:45:00.000Z	mater	Radtoo	can we talk about this on #rootkit, cause it too much traffic here
2009-05-05T16:45:00.000Z	Radtoo	mater	you can do a reinstall? just tell it to use the old partitions you had.
2009-05-05T16:46:00.000Z	mater	Radtoo	i don't see a choice to use old partitions during ubuntu reinstall, or rather fresh install
2009-05-05T16:46:00.000Z	Radtoo	mater	It has no "free" space to work with at the moment but if you tell it to use the existing ubuntu partitiosn all wil be fine. As for #rootkit, sorry, no. I also don't know everything or make no mistakes, its good if other people think along :)
2009-05-05T16:48:00.000Z	Radtoo	mater	You can. "Manually edit partition table" at worst
