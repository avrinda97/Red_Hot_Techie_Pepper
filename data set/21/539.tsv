2011-10-19T04:54:00.000Z	sharkus		Hello all.
2011-10-19T04:55:00.000Z	sharkus		I'm trying to install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7 on an acer laptop. I am not seeing the option to install alongside Windows 7, only options to replace or something else
2011-10-19T04:55:00.000Z	sharkus		Any ideas why I'm not seeing the install alongside option?
2011-10-19T04:56:00.000Z	sharkus		this is 11.04 btw
2011-10-19T04:58:00.000Z	yagoo	sharkus	did u choose "something else" option? see if u can resize ntfs
2011-10-19T04:59:00.000Z	yagoo	sharkus	i'm not sure if ntfs can be resized..
2011-10-19T04:59:00.000Z	yagoo	sharkus	i mean-- i'm not sure if ntfs can be resized with the ubuntu installer-- but it can be with the gparted live cd (sf.net)
2011-10-19T04:59:00.000Z	yagoo	sharkus	that's perfect..
2011-10-19T05:00:00.000Z	yagoo	sharkus	and make 2 partitions for linux-- 1 ext4 and the other swap (swap should be 1 gig)
2011-10-19T05:05:00.000Z	yagoo	sharkus	that acer partition is a dumb recovery filesystem for reinstal windows..
2011-10-19T05:05:00.000Z	yagoo	sharkus	u can ignore that..
2011-10-19T05:06:00.000Z	yagoo	sharkus	btw.. if u do fdisk -l .. it may say cylinder boundary doesn't land etc.. this is common and is safe to ignore..
2011-10-19T05:06:00.000Z	sharkus	yagoo	think it's the actual active partition, as it's 286GB, there is some recovery partition of 11GB,
2011-10-19T05:06:00.000Z	yagoo	sharkus	that's fine.. u can leave it there
2011-10-19T05:06:00.000Z	yagoo	sharkus	actually gparted does that..
2011-10-19T05:06:00.000Z	yagoo	sharkus	it does ntfs check before it resizes..
2011-10-19T05:07:00.000Z	yagoo	sharkus	what sizes u going to make for ext4 and swap?
2011-10-19T05:08:00.000Z	sharkus	yagoo	not sure, what would you recommend?
2011-10-19T05:08:00.000Z	yagoo	sharkus	how much is used on ntfs ?
2011-10-21T21:34:00.000Z	yagoo	sharkus	edit /etc/default/grub  for _DEFAULT=  (numbering starts from 0)-- then update-grub2
2011-10-21T21:36:00.000Z	yagoo	sharkus	/etc/defaul/grub is documented.. i dont suggest renaming those script files..
