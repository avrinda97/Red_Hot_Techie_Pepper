2007-10-07T07:31:00.000Z	hozano		Hi folks. The automount of my ubuntu do not open my pen drive and show this error: mount_point cannot contain the following character... Where i configure it ?
2007-10-07T07:32:00.000Z	stefg	hozano	usually the mount point is extracted from the label of the filesystem. So i'd give the filesystem on the stick a name with standard characters only

2007-10-07T07:35:00.000Z	hozano	stefg	thanks
2007-10-07T08:08:00.000Z	hozano	stefg	I had change the label of usb driver, but the problem still persist
2007-10-07T08:08:00.000Z	hozano	stefg	This problem began when I rename the mount point using nautilus... Any idea?
2007-10-07T08:10:00.000Z	stefg	hozano	unmount and unplug the stick, then remove the subdir in /media. The automounter should take care of mountpoint creation. There's even some .hal-* files in /media which you should delete
2007-10-07T08:11:00.000Z	stefg	hozano	then lg the stick back in and see if it changes soemthing
2007-10-07T08:12:00.000Z	hozano	stefg	ok. I will try it.
2007-10-07T08:13:00.000Z	hozano	stefg	Did not work... =/
2007-10-07T08:14:00.000Z	hozano	stefg	same problem
2007-10-07T08:15:00.000Z	stefg	hozano	look at dmesg (or !paste it )
2007-10-07T08:19:00.000Z	hozano	stefg	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/39861/
2007-10-07T08:20:00.000Z	hozano	stefg	the device is /dev/sdb and I had removed .hal* files
2007-10-07T08:25:00.000Z	stefg	hozano	looks perfectly normal.... hmmm. would be interesting if a reboot or hal rstart changes anything
2007-10-07T08:27:00.000Z	hozano	stefg	the same usb driver works normally until I rename the mount point through nautilus...
2007-10-07T08:27:00.000Z	hozano	stefg	where the automount gets the cached configurations of usb drives ?
2007-10-07T08:28:00.000Z	stefg	hozano	no idea, but a reboot would refresh that
2007-10-07T08:29:00.000Z	hozano	stefg	Ok. I will reboot then.
2007-10-07T08:29:00.000Z	hozano	stefg	thanks for all
