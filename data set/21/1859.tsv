2010-04-06T09:03:00.000Z	rshakin		whats the current version of kernel in daily build of ubuntu
2010-04-06T09:04:00.000Z	rshakin		!current
2010-04-06T09:06:00.000Z	stiltzkin	rshakin	I think it's 2.6.32-19
2010-04-06T09:07:00.000Z	rshakin	stiltzkin	ok good cause i think the hardware driver i need is been merged into the tree already as of .17
2010-04-06T09:09:00.000Z	rshakin	stiltzkin	is there a way to get the 9.10 with the new kernel already in it is there a daily build images with updates
2010-04-06T09:09:00.000Z	stiltzkin	rshakin	you mean 10.10 with the new kernel?
2010-04-06T09:09:00.000Z	stiltzkin	rshakin	er, 10.04 rather
2010-04-06T09:09:00.000Z	rshakin	stiltzkin	i mean 9 series
2010-04-06T09:10:00.000Z	stiltzkin	rshakin	you'd have to do a lot of finegling to get a newer kernel running in 9.10. There will be lots of conflicting packages. Baddddd idea
2010-04-06T09:11:00.000Z	rshakin	stiltzkin	whats the most curent version for 9 series
2010-04-06T09:11:00.000Z	stiltzkin	rshakin	2.6.31-20
2010-04-06T09:12:00.000Z	rshakin	stiltzkin	is there a way to get the current iso build with that kernel i am not sure it shipped with that kernel
2010-04-06T09:12:00.000Z	stiltzkin	rshakin	which kernel do you want? If you want 2.6.32 then get the 10.04 daily build. If you're OK with 2.6.31 (latest stable) then get the latest 9.10.
2010-04-06T09:15:00.000Z	rshakin	stiltzkin	i am just trying to make this wifi card work it's a buffalo wli-uc-gn thats not supported by the default 9.10 install as per https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/441990 bug was fixed but i think it's down on daily build only
2010-04-06T09:28:00.000Z	stiltzkin	rshakin	sorry bout that, I'm back. looks like you should try this first: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=9028760#post9028760
2010-04-06T09:30:00.000Z	stiltzkin	rshakin	and you're right, it was patched upstream. the fix is present in kernels starting with 2.6.32-18. So the 10.04 beta should fix it for you as wekk.
2010-04-06T09:51:00.000Z	rshakin	stiltzkin	sorry i was on the phone i will try it, is there a way to get those packages installed offline so i can get online... ?
2010-04-06T09:52:00.000Z	stiltzkin	rshakin	yeah, just download the .deb and save it for later
2010-04-06T09:52:00.000Z	rshakin	stiltzkin	ok will try doing that next
2010-04-06T09:53:00.000Z	rshakin	stiltzkin	i actually almost have the cur lucid downloaded i am going to try that first if not i am going to then download the 9 version and do the kernel updates
2010-04-06T09:54:00.000Z	stiltzkin	rshakin	cool, sounds like a plan :)
