2011-01-21T04:32:00.000Z	KM0201	Cpt_Zyph	well, what is your wireless device?

2011-01-21T04:35:00.000Z	KM0201	Cpt_Zyph	i just helped someone set that device up yesterday or the day before... i think it needs the b43
2011-01-21T04:38:00.000Z	KM0201	Cpt_Zyph	so is your wireless working or not?...
2011-01-21T04:38:00.000Z	Cpt_Zyph	KM0201	yep has been like a champ
2011-01-21T04:38:00.000Z	KM0201	Cpt_Zyph	oh, i thought you said you were having problems w/ it...
2011-01-21T04:38:00.000Z	Cpt_Zyph	KM0201	just someone rdo or something told me mthat driver suckede and i was locking cuz of it
2011-01-21T04:38:00.000Z	KM0201	Cpt_Zyph	thats ridiculous.... a lot of people use that device w/o issue
2011-01-21T04:39:00.000Z	Cpt_Zyph	KM0201	i figured the same but im so new to this i was like well.... humm... *) unknown to me atm
2011-01-21T04:39:00.000Z	KM0201	Cpt_Zyph	i can't explain your locking up/freezing.. but i feel fairly confident whatever it is, it is not related to your wireless device.
2011-01-21T04:41:00.000Z	KM0201	Cpt_Zyph	well.. i guess i'll state the obvious, is your laptop over heating
2011-01-21T04:41:00.000Z	Cpt_Zyph	KM0201	na its deffently not a hardware overheating issue.. just thats the only way to discribe how random it is
2011-01-21T04:42:00.000Z	Cpt_Zyph	KM0201	if your familar with CPU heating up problems that hwo random it is
2011-01-21T04:42:00.000Z	KM0201	Cpt_Zyph	yup, i am.. i just figured i'd ask the obvious question
2011-01-21T04:42:00.000Z	Cpt_Zyph	KM0201	understood .. np *)
2011-01-23T10:20:00.000Z	KM0201	Cpt_Zyph	why on earth would you want to install nvidia drivers from command line?... can you not install them from system/admn/additional drivers?
2011-01-28T01:52:00.000Z	KM0201	Cpt_Zyph	are you here unregistered?
2011-01-28T01:53:00.000Z	Cpt_Zyph	KM0201	nope
