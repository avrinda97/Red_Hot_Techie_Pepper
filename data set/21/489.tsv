2012-04-13T20:28:00.000Z	jbrks	family	probably it's an old driver source, you have anything more recent?
2012-04-13T20:32:00.000Z	jbrks	family	where did you download the source code?
2012-04-13T20:33:00.000Z	family	jbrks	came on cd with device
2012-04-13T20:34:00.000Z	jbrks	family	it's old source code, i see other people mention it on forums.. try using the latest source code..
2012-04-13T20:35:00.000Z	jbrks	family	btw, what's the device id from lspci or lsusb ?
2012-04-13T20:36:00.000Z	family	jbrks	lsusb it's shown
2012-04-13T20:37:00.000Z	jbrks	family	i'm guessing you mean 048d:9135 shows..
2012-04-13T20:41:00.000Z	jbrks	family	it says it's supported but from kernel 3.2 ( http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/DVB-T_USB_Devices/Full )
2012-04-13T20:41:00.000Z	jbrks	family	scratch that..
2012-04-13T20:42:00.000Z	family	jbrks	is it supported then?
2012-04-13T20:43:00.000Z	jbrks	family	i dont see the deviceid mentioned on that page, but someone on a forum referred to that post with your device, and tried the latest kernel with it..
2012-04-13T20:43:00.000Z	jbrks	family	try kernel of at least 3.2.xx
2012-04-13T20:44:00.000Z	family	jbrks	umm that might be too advaned for me.
2012-04-13T20:44:00.000Z	jbrks	family	this means you don't use need to use any other source code.. because the usbtv sourcecode should already be with the kernel3.2.xx
2012-04-13T20:44:00.000Z	jbrks	family	it may already be in your repos.. did u try apt-upgrading, or using the latest ubuntu?
2012-04-13T20:44:00.000Z	family	jbrks	easy to change kernal?
2012-04-13T20:45:00.000Z	jbrks	family	kernels dont always replace, apt might add an option to the grub menu..
2012-04-13T20:45:00.000Z	jbrks	family	oh.. so perhaps you may be on kernel3.0xx already..
2012-04-13T20:45:00.000Z	family	jbrks	ok, i will google it and come back if needed.
2012-04-13T20:46:00.000Z	family	jbrks	thanks
2012-04-13T20:46:00.000Z	jbrks	family	you'd need at least 3.2.xx
