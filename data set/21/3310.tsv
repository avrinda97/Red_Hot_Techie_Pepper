2009-02-27T07:29:00.000Z	exodus_ms	_VIM_	are you willing to walk him through how to use vi :P
2009-03-01T09:09:00.000Z	_VIM_	exodus_ms	forums are working fine for me (using Opera)
2009-03-01T09:10:00.000Z	exodus_ms	_VIM_	cool, I'm looking at it right no with FF and it looks as thought the css stylesheet has been removed or not being linked to
