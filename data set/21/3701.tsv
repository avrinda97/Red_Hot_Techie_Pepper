2008-10-19T23:42:00.000Z	crtoe	baldur_	apparently your hardware isn't detected
2008-10-19T23:42:00.000Z	crtoe	baldur_	this could mean that either there's no kernel support for it or that you don't have the appropriate driver(s) loaded for it
2008-10-19T23:43:00.000Z	baldur_	crtoe	 but it works my internet is working fine i just wanna change my ip on the network and cant do that ??
2008-10-19T23:43:00.000Z	baldur_	crtoe	should i find drivers if so how do i do that ?
2008-10-19T23:44:00.000Z	crtoe	baldur_	post the output of dmesg to pastebin. also post the output of lsmod.
2008-10-19T23:44:00.000Z	crtoe	baldur_	if you can, try posting on pastebin the output of lshw as well
2008-10-19T23:44:00.000Z	baldur_	crtoe	 sorry i didint relly understand what you said ??? whats pastebin  and all that ??
2008-10-19T23:46:00.000Z	baldur_	crtoe	ok what should i put there ?
2008-10-19T23:46:00.000Z	crtoe	baldur_	read my previous message again. if you're not going to put any effort in to helping yourself, i'm not going to try either
2008-10-19T23:46:00.000Z	baldur_	crtoe	dmesg ?? and lsmod  ??? yeahh i am just dont know what these two are sorry
2008-10-19T23:47:00.000Z	crtoe	baldur_	they are commands. open a terminal emulator (konsole, gnome-terminal, xterm, etc.) or from the console, run those commands and paste the output to pastebin
2008-10-19T23:48:00.000Z	baldur_	crtoe	 ok i run dmesg and lsmod in the termenal and then post em there RGR
2008-10-19T23:50:00.000Z	baldur_	crtoe	 should i copy all the text becuz its like 5 pages long ?
2008-10-19T23:50:00.000Z	crtoe	baldur_	yes, everything. enter the commands man dmesg and man lsmod for why i asked for those
