2007-04-01T16:22:00.000Z	Kazol		Is there any way to refresh a floppy drive rather than remounting it?
2007-04-01T16:22:00.000Z	soundray	Kazol	"refresh"?
2007-04-01T16:23:00.000Z	Kazol	soundray	No, for some reason it caches the files, and refresh does nothing. Does anyone still use floppy disks?
2007-04-01T16:23:00.000Z	soundray	Kazol	rarely...
2007-04-01T16:24:00.000Z	soundray	Kazol	type 'sync ; sync'. When it returns, the buffers will be flushed
2007-04-01T16:25:00.000Z	Kazol	soundray	where\how?
2007-04-01T16:25:00.000Z	soundray	Kazol	in a terminal window
2007-04-01T16:26:00.000Z	Kazol	soundray	so "fd0 sync ; sync" ?
2007-04-01T16:26:00.000Z	soundray	Kazol	leave out the fd0
2007-04-01T16:26:00.000Z	Kazol	soundray	thx
2007-04-01T16:26:00.000Z	soundray	Kazol	sync flushes all the buffers on all disks
2007-04-30T14:03:00.000Z	soundray	Kazol	in edgy/feisty, click the upper right X and wait. If it doesn't respond, it will offer you to force-quit it after a few seconds.
2007-04-30T14:04:00.000Z	Kazol	soundray	I have dapper, but I have this "force quit" icon
2007-04-30T14:04:00.000Z	soundray	Kazol	click it, then click the window of the misbehaving program, then follow instructions
2007-04-30T14:05:00.000Z	Kazol	soundray	it's a notification from azureus; I cannot force close it.
2007-04-30T14:05:00.000Z	soundray	Kazol	hmm
2007-04-30T14:05:00.000Z	soundray	Kazol	try Alt-F2 xkill -- then click the notification.
2007-04-30T14:06:00.000Z	soundray	Kazol	failing that, open a terminal and run 'killall azureus'
2007-04-30T14:06:00.000Z	Kazol	soundray	none of the methods work.
2007-04-30T14:07:00.000Z	soundray	Kazol	okay, in that case, you have to step up the effort. Run 'ps ax | grep azu' and see if it shows any lines corresponding to the bad program.
2007-04-30T14:11:00.000Z	soundray	Kazol	you still with me?
