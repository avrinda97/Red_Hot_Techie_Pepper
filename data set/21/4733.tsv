2008-10-07T11:44:00.000Z	jim_p	MTecknology	too bad though for a 1500$ notebook not to have bluetooth. sony is all looks as it seems
2008-10-07T11:44:00.000Z	MTecknology	jim_p	ya, i noticed it's pretty fast - it's altogether a pretty solid system too - I don't like that there's no latch on the screen though - kayboard is a dream
2008-10-07T11:45:00.000Z	jim_p	MTecknology	your call then
2008-10-07T11:46:00.000Z	MTecknology	jim_p	I already have the system - have for a year almost - never considered using bluetooth though
