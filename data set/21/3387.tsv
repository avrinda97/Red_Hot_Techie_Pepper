2009-03-03T00:27:00.000Z	oCean_	BrixSat	?
2009-03-03T00:28:00.000Z	BrixSat	oCean_	 i need to pastebin a code and i have done on http://pastebin.com/mc360eae but DasEI  says it is empty
2009-03-03T00:28:00.000Z	oCean_	BrixSat	the link is not empty, I can see the output. Try paste.ubuntu.com
2009-03-04T16:29:00.000Z	oCean_	BrixSat	put the command in /etc/rc.local
2009-03-28T04:58:00.000Z	oCean_	BrixSat	how did you install that?
2009-03-28T04:58:00.000Z	BrixSat	oCean_	configure && make && make install
2009-03-28T04:59:00.000Z	oCean_	BrixSat	ok, because it is not the LSB style to have the 'init functions' script there
2009-03-28T04:59:00.000Z	BrixSat	oCean_	so where should they be?
2009-03-28T04:59:00.000Z	oCean_	BrixSat	It is actually in /lib/lsb/init-functions
2009-03-28T05:00:00.000Z	oCean_	BrixSat	so you may want to try and change that path in the init script, but I'm not sure whether it will work properly
2009-03-28T05:00:00.000Z	BrixSat	oCean_	and now where is the Can't open /etc/sysconfig/network
2009-03-28T05:03:00.000Z	oCean_	BrixSat	well, that is in several files. (like /etc/network/interfaces)
2009-12-21T23:28:00.000Z	oCean_	BrixSat	arts as in gnome art?
2009-12-21T23:28:00.000Z	BrixSat	oCean_	no kde i think
2009-12-21T23:29:00.000Z	BrixSat	oCean_	i dont what eyecandy i want to be able to compile a program that depends on that one
2009-12-21T23:30:00.000Z	oCean_	BrixSat	I misunderstood. You asked "arts" Desktop "candy" is often referred to as artwork
