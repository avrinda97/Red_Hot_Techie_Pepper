2007-07-23T14:20:00.000Z	jonphilpott		anyone running ubuntu laptop with a ricoh pcmcia controller?
2007-07-23T14:21:00.000Z	dystopianray	jonphilpott	i think mine might be
2007-07-23T14:21:00.000Z	jonphilpott	dystopianray	does it work for you?
2007-07-23T14:21:00.000Z	dystopianray	jonphilpott	it works, i will check if it is ricoh
2007-07-23T14:21:00.000Z	dystopianray	jonphilpott	I know I have a ricoh card reader
2007-07-23T14:23:00.000Z	dystopianray	jonphilpott	yes I have richo pcmcia and it has always worked without issue
2007-07-23T14:23:00.000Z	dystopianray	jonphilpott	it is a Richo RL5c476
2007-07-23T14:25:00.000Z	jonphilpott	dystopianray	this is a RL5C475
2007-07-23T14:25:00.000Z	dystopianray	jonphilpott	so i assume they'd be very similar and that yours should work
2007-07-23T14:25:00.000Z	jonphilpott	dystopianray	no such luck, im afraid.
2007-07-23T14:26:00.000Z	dystopianray	jonphilpott	are there any errors in dmesg when you plug in pcmcia devices?
2007-07-23T14:26:00.000Z	jonphilpott	dystopianray	one moment, im just booting the machine in question. its my wifes laptop, shes interested in trying ubuntu.. but wireless is a deal breaker :)
2007-07-23T14:26:00.000Z	dystopianray	jonphilpott	wireless pcmcia card?
2007-07-23T14:26:00.000Z	jonphilpott	dystopianray	yeah
2007-07-23T14:27:00.000Z	jonphilpott	dystopianray	both of them work in my laptop
2007-07-23T14:31:00.000Z	jonphilpott	dystopianray	i get "pccard: PCMCIA card inserted into slot 0", and nothing else
2007-07-23T14:31:00.000Z	dystopianray	jonphilpott	does the card appear in lspci?
2007-07-23T14:31:00.000Z	jonphilpott	dystopianray	nope
2007-07-23T14:32:00.000Z	dystopianray	jonphilpott	hrrm that is strange
2007-07-23T14:32:00.000Z	jonphilpott	dystopianray	my thoughts exactly
2007-07-23T14:33:00.000Z	dystopianray	jonphilpott	perhaps try a different livecd if you have one, to see if the behaviour is different
