2009-08-29T13:10:00.000Z	Starcraftmazter		whats the default password for www-data ?
2009-08-29T13:11:00.000Z	lstarnes	Starcraftmazter	there isn't one
2009-08-29T13:11:00.000Z	Starcraftmazter	lstarnes	blank gives me incorrect password error =/
2009-08-29T13:11:00.000Z	lstarnes	Starcraftmazter	it's not an account that can be used with a normal login
2009-08-29T13:11:00.000Z	lstarnes	Starcraftmazter	it's a special-purpose account intended solely for use by web servers
2009-08-29T13:12:00.000Z	Starcraftmazter	lstarnes	ok, i need to start/stop postgres server from php, and im using shell_exec, but its not working, so i was hoping to debug it by logging in as www-data...
2009-08-29T13:12:00.000Z	Starcraftmazter	lstarnes	do you know why it may not work
2009-08-29T13:12:00.000Z	lstarnes	Starcraftmazter	possibly because postgres is running as another user
2009-08-29T13:13:00.000Z	Starcraftmazter	lstarnes	its not running
2009-08-29T13:13:00.000Z	Starcraftmazter	lstarnes	exact same command works from my user
2009-08-29T13:13:00.000Z	lstarnes	Starcraftmazter	it is considered insecure to use a web script for starting or stopping postgres
2009-08-29T13:13:00.000Z	Starcraftmazter	lstarnes	i know, this is purely for testing purposes
2009-08-29T13:13:00.000Z	lstarnes	Starcraftmazter	I'm not sure how to do it in PHP
2009-08-29T13:14:00.000Z	Starcraftmazter	lstarnes	is it possible to run a php script under a different user?
2009-08-29T13:14:00.000Z	lstarnes	Starcraftmazter	possibly, but that would likely be difficult
2009-08-29T13:14:00.000Z	lstarnes	Starcraftmazter	I know apache has a suexec module
2009-08-29T13:15:00.000Z	Starcraftmazter	lstarnes	would it work if i run php from the commandline, as though it was perl and point #! to the php interpretor
2009-08-29T13:15:00.000Z	lstarnes	Starcraftmazter	maybe
2009-11-18T11:39:00.000Z	lstarnes	Starcraftmazter	what error message do you get?
2009-11-18T11:39:00.000Z	Starcraftmazter	lstarnes	timeout
2009-11-18T11:40:00.000Z	lstarnes	Starcraftmazter	I'm not sure what would be causing that
