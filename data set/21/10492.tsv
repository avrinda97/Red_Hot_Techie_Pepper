2005-03-05T07:29:00.000Z	Coily		does anyone know how to force kill a connection?
2005-03-05T07:30:00.000Z	Coily		:O
2005-03-05T07:31:00.000Z	Coily		well id like to kill connections individually
2005-03-05T07:31:00.000Z	evarlast	Coily	you can't kill a connection, you can kill a process that holds a connection.
2005-03-05T07:31:00.000Z	evarlast	Coily	you can use iptables to firewall a connection.
2005-03-05T07:32:00.000Z	evarlast	Coily	lsof
2005-03-05T07:36:00.000Z	evarlast	Coily	see the man page, you can narrow results down with lsof.
2005-03-05T07:37:00.000Z	evarlast	Coily	for example:  lsof -i tcp #to get just tcp connections
2005-03-05T08:41:00.000Z	evarlast	Coily	but what is the STATUS of the connection?
2005-03-05T08:41:00.000Z	evarlast	Coily	it would be normal for the status to be CLOSE_WAIT
2005-03-05T08:42:00.000Z	Coily	evarlast	i dont believe thats the case
2005-03-05T08:43:00.000Z	evarlast	Coily	is this a NAT box?  Maybe some other computer is running AIM and connecting out?  AIM comes with OMG spyware.  Maybe it is weatherbug or something like that?
2005-03-05T08:43:00.000Z	Coily	evarlast	im the only one in my network =[
2005-03-05T08:54:00.000Z	evarlast	Coily	netstat -na.
2005-03-05T08:54:00.000Z	evarlast	Coily	netstat -vpna as root is very helpful.
2005-03-05T08:55:00.000Z	evarlast	Coily	LOL. yes there is netstat.  Why wouldn't there be?
2005-03-05T08:56:00.000Z	evarlast	Coily	if you are coming from windows... well, unix had it first.  ;)
2005-03-05T08:58:00.000Z	evarlast	Coily	or pipe to less.
2005-03-05T08:59:00.000Z	evarlast	Coily	if you mean gnome-terminal, its in settings under the scrollback tab.
2005-03-05T09:04:00.000Z	evarlast	Coily	drop the a.
2005-03-05T09:04:00.000Z	evarlast	Coily	netstat -nvp | less
