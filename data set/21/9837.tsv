2005-07-03T11:44:00.000Z	plefno		yes, just a couple hours ago.  actually several times now
2005-07-03T11:44:00.000Z	plefno		the system doesn't have any internet connection at the moment because it's connected via wireless
2005-07-03T11:45:00.000Z	plefno		no, it doesn't
2005-07-03T11:45:00.000Z	plefno		it's completely frozen up if i try to go into GNOME
2005-07-03T11:46:00.000Z	plefno		2.6.10
2005-07-03T11:46:00.000Z	plefno		yeah, right after i put in my username and password it looks like it starts to boot but then locks up
2005-07-03T11:47:00.000Z	plefno		i have a geforce 6200 256mb
2005-07-03T11:48:00.000Z	plefno		whatever the installation chose
2005-07-03T11:49:00.000Z	plefno		no, i don't think it will freeze if i just let it sit there
2005-07-03T11:50:00.000Z	plefno		well i'm extremely new to linux so I don't know how to do that.  any howtos you can point me to to help out?
2005-07-03T11:50:00.000Z	bimberi	plefno	ok.  so it's unlikely to be something that starts up after gdm
2005-07-03T11:34:00.000Z	bimberi	plefno	ask away - hopefully someone can help
2005-07-03T11:37:00.000Z	bimberi	plefno	anything on the screen at all?
2005-07-03T11:38:00.000Z	bimberi	plefno	does <ctrl><alt>F2  do anything?
2005-07-03T11:42:00.000Z	bimberi	plefno	I think you should try booting into "recovery mode" and looking through the log files (in /var/log).  I'm trying to see which one(s) might have anthing interesting
2005-07-03T11:49:00.000Z	bimberi	plefno	does it only freeze after you put in your un/pw or if you leave it does it freeze anyway?
2005-07-03T11:58:00.000Z	bimberi	plefno	It's probably still worth trying the Howto - things can only improve
2005-07-03T11:59:00.000Z	bimberi	plefno	how many install so far? :)
2005-07-03T12:01:00.000Z	bimberi	plefno	yes a "sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop" will do that
2005-07-03T12:08:00.000Z	bimberi	plefno	great!
2005-07-03T12:28:00.000Z	bimberi	plefno	still here?
