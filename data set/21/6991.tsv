2007-10-03T07:30:00.000Z	chris4		usr13:how?
2007-10-03T07:31:00.000Z	chris4		 usr13: now what
2007-10-03T07:31:00.000Z	Pelo	chris4	 try this,    alt+f2   type gnome-panel  , if that does nothing,   alt-f2  type gconf-editor   in there look under /app/panel  see if there is a box you can check
2007-10-03T07:35:00.000Z	Pelo	chris4	gconf-editor it is installed by default
2007-10-03T07:37:00.000Z	Pelo	chris4	  gconf-editor is a gui app if you have no pannel start it with  the alt-f2 luancher dialog
2007-10-03T07:37:00.000Z	Pelo	chris4	ahhhhhh,  wrong channel
2007-10-03T07:38:00.000Z	Pelo	chris4	 in xubuntu I beleive you can get a lot of options if you right click the desktop , I think you can get access to a pannel dialog from there
2007-10-03T07:39:00.000Z	Pelo	chris4	 alt-crtl-f7
2007-10-03T07:42:00.000Z	Pelo	chris4	look under  /app/panel  see if you find a box to check for default pannel to display
2007-10-03T07:45:00.000Z	Pelo	chris4	  /apps/panel/default_setup
2007-10-03T07:46:00.000Z	Pelo	chris4	and right lickcing on the desktop does not bring up a menu option for pannel or dockbar or any desktop layout stuff ?
2007-10-03T07:46:00.000Z	Pelo	chris4	I don'T know then
2007-10-03T07:49:00.000Z	Pelo	chris4	  read what   Photocopy  just said to me
2007-10-03T07:51:00.000Z	Pelo	chris4	it should stick  but look for a session manager somwehere
2007-10-03T07:51:00.000Z	Pelo	chris4	 might just be called session
2007-10-03T07:53:00.000Z	Pelo	chris4	 shoudl be a simple matter of adding   xfce-panel to the list of apps to run on startup
2007-10-03T07:55:00.000Z	Pelo	chris4	 also check the various tabs and see if  there is a save session button,  if you have one , just start what you want on start up,  close what you dn'T wnat and save the ssession
2007-10-03T07:55:00.000Z	chris4	Pelo	added it to autostated apps
2007-10-03T07:55:00.000Z	Pelo	chris4	that should be it then
2007-10-03T07:59:00.000Z	chris4	Pelo	as soon as I close the terminal window my bars dissapear again
2007-10-03T08:00:00.000Z	Pelo	chris4	that's becaue you started it with the terminal and not a launcher,  it should start on it's own with a restart of the destkop
