2005-10-26T11:24:00.000Z	hui		quick aside I get no response from firefox how do I kill it?
2005-10-26T11:24:00.000Z	hui		um, I mean kill it using graphical tools
2005-10-26T11:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic	hui	 killall mozilla-firefox should do it :)
2005-10-26T11:25:00.000Z	thoreauputic	hui	there's an xkill applet for gnome - right click the panel to add it
2005-10-26T11:25:00.000Z	thoreauputic		then you just click the applet and zap the offending app
2005-10-26T11:27:00.000Z	hui		I am trying to navigate more graphically in Linux.
2005-10-26T11:27:00.000Z	hui		More to see if it can be done than anything else
2005-10-26T11:28:00.000Z	hui		now that I know I have parted, how do I find it...since I can't find the icon
2005-10-26T11:29:00.000Z	hui		smartalec...he says slapping himself in the forhead
2005-10-26T11:30:00.000Z	hui		don't I have to sudo that or something?
2005-10-26T11:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic	hui	to be graphical, gksudo xterm -e parted :D
2005-10-26T11:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic		heh
2005-10-26T11:33:00.000Z	hui		thoreaputic :  invalid option -- e
2005-10-26T11:37:00.000Z	hui	thoreauputic	I think that it parsed the -e with gksudo and not with xterm?
2005-10-26T11:38:00.000Z	hui		given up on that anyway, I opened an xterm
2005-10-26T11:38:00.000Z	thoreauputic	hui	my command was a kind of joke - parted is noy a gui app; you would need gparted or qtparted
2005-10-26T11:39:00.000Z	thoreauputic		s/noy/not
2005-10-26T11:39:00.000Z	thoreauputic	hui	to run a terminal app from a new term you use the -e for execute flag
2005-10-26T11:40:00.000Z	thoreauputic		e.g xterm -e alsamixer
2005-10-26T11:40:00.000Z	hui		very funny ha ha
2005-10-26T11:41:00.000Z	thoreauputic	hui	I thought so - glad you enjoyed my joke :D
