2009-09-29T02:11:00.000Z	h4f		My cpu governor does not scale quickly enough the frequency . for ex. rendering web pages requires high cpu just for one second.
2009-09-29T02:13:00.000Z	h4f		how can I made my cpu governor scale  my frequency faster ?
2009-09-29T02:13:00.000Z	carresmd	h4f	You could disable the scaling ..
2009-09-29T02:14:00.000Z	carresmd	h4f	Not sure if you actually can make it faster
2009-09-29T02:14:00.000Z	h4f	carresmd	but than the cpu will always run on its max
2009-09-29T02:14:00.000Z	h4f	carresmd	to render a web page with flash its just one second. that's not enough to trigger the governor
2009-09-29T02:15:00.000Z	carresmd	h4f	Wait a sec.. I'll try to find some info on this
2009-09-29T02:18:00.000Z	carresmd		h4l: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/107545
2009-09-29T02:19:00.000Z	carresmd		h4l: maybe that could be some help .. look at the devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/ondemand/sampling_rate line
2009-09-29T02:19:00.000Z	carresmd		h4l, lowering it should make it sample more often
2009-09-29T02:19:00.000Z	h4f	carresmd	I found this one http://allredb.wordpress.com/2009/05/07/speed-up-flash-and-firefox-in-ubuntu-jaunty-904/

2009-09-29T02:20:00.000Z	h4f	carresmd	ok . will try that
2009-09-29T02:21:00.000Z	carresmd	h4f	you can just echo to it with 'echo <number> | sudo tee <thefile>
2009-09-29T02:21:00.000Z	carresmd	h4f	now sure if you should do it with all cores though
2009-09-29T02:22:00.000Z	h4f		 carresmd:iceroot: http://linux.digitalsp.com/2009/08/improving-stuttering-during-flash-video.html this is even better
2009-09-29T02:24:00.000Z	carresmd	h4f	that's probably a better solutions .. But it won't increase the sampling time though
2009-09-29T02:24:00.000Z	h4f	carresmd	well I changed up_treshold to 40. now it looks my FF renders pages quiqer
2009-09-29T02:25:00.000Z	carresmd	h4f	glad to see it worked.. And if you undo the changes you just made and edit the sampling_rate file .. Does that have any affect as well?
