2010-01-02T08:40:00.000Z	miked595		anyone familiar with mediamonkey on windows? I'm looking for an app that can auto tag ID3 and auto the path based on the id3
2010-01-02T08:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	miked595	amarok can try guess tags based on path
2010-01-02T08:41:00.000Z	miked595	ActionParsnip	I'm trying to do the other way around
2010-01-02T08:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	miked595	like, moving the files automatically, based on tag?
2010-01-02T08:42:00.000Z	miked595	ActionParsnip	ya mediamonkey does that and I ca autotag from amazon's library
2010-01-02T08:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	miked595	not sure about that, not something i'd trust personally
2010-04-30T21:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	miked595	check the helper addons and make sure ftp isnt in there
2010-04-30T21:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	miked595	or add nautilus (or whatever you use) in there as the app to use or somesuch. It may be a setting in gconf or even nautilus itself
2010-04-30T21:05:00.000Z	miked595	ActionParsnip	where is the helper addons?
2010-04-30T21:06:00.000Z	miked595	ActionParsnip	it works in nautilus if i click the bookmark inside of it. it's just annoying that the places menu uses firefox since forefox sucks at ftp
2010-04-30T21:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	miked595	firefox sucks at http too
2010-04-30T21:08:00.000Z	miked595	ActionParsnip	better then IE but i do like google chrome better... much faster.
2010-04-30T21:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	miked595	and arora :)
2010-04-30T21:08:00.000Z	miked595	ActionParsnip	so where is this helper addons lol
2010-04-30T21:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	miked595	i think under tools menu, i havent used firefox in aaages

2010-04-30T21:11:00.000Z	miked595	ActionParsnip	reading now thanx
2010-04-30T21:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	miked595	good ol jeeves :)
2010-04-30T21:15:00.000Z	miked595	ActionParsnip	lol the desktop shortcut open nautilus now but the link in Places still opens firefox
2010-04-30T21:24:00.000Z	miked595	ActionParsnip	I found a bug which shows a fix, thanx for the push in the right direction. I needed to do "killall gconfd-2 && killall gnome-panel" to get the change to work in the Places menu. the bug is here athough they mainly argue about it being a bug. https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox-3.0/+bug/196202
2010-04-30T21:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	miked595	nice find :)
