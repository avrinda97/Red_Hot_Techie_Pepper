2008-01-14T22:59:00.000Z	sdakak		I need to decide between using the amd64 version of Gutsy and the simple one. Would all the effort be worth the performance gain? Please help.
2008-01-14T22:59:00.000Z	sdakak		!amd64
2008-01-14T23:01:00.000Z	sdakak		i need someone more experienced to answer. is amd64 version worth the trouble?
2008-01-14T23:01:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sdakak	not in my opinion..
2008-01-14T23:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sdakak	If you have more than 4 gigs of ram you probably have hard drive space to burn as well so why not install both
2008-01-14T23:03:00.000Z	sdakak	Jack_Sparrow	lukasz: what about the performance gains? As most of the universe packages are compiled for 64bit i think there would be high gains.
2008-01-14T23:03:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sdakak	MOst I have talked with didnt see enough speed for the time it took...
2008-01-14T23:03:00.000Z	sdakak	Jack_Sparrow	i was hoping the forums and there were workarounds for all problems for 64 bit stuff.
2008-01-14T23:04:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sdakak	Workarounds and running 32 bit versions will cause a performance hit , which is why you go to 64 in the first place
2008-01-14T23:05:00.000Z	sdakak	Jack_Sparrow	i would have gone ahead with 64bit but for one problem. The wizardpen driver that i need for my tablet does not work in amd64 https://help.ubuntu.com/community/TabletSetupWizardpen
2008-01-14T23:06:00.000Z	sdakak	Jack_Sparrow	but you see except flash (and other propriety stuff) everything is available natively compiled in a 64 bit environment. What would you suggest?
2008-01-14T23:06:00.000Z	sdakak	Jack_Sparrow	i even saw 64bit versions of the win-codecs available.
2008-01-14T23:06:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sdakak	I suggest you try both and make up your own mind..
2008-01-14T23:06:00.000Z	sdakak	Jack_Sparrow	did you run away from 64bit to 32?
2008-01-14T23:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sdakak	Yes, no longer running 64 bit
2008-01-14T23:07:00.000Z	sdakak	Jack_Sparrow	do you consider yourself a power user? And still did not find the workarounds comfortable?
2008-01-14T23:08:00.000Z	sdakak	Jack_Sparrow	than is not a jab at you. just trying to make up my mind.
2008-01-14T23:09:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sdakak	understood..
2008-04-20T19:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	sdakak	that would be a better discussion for the #Ubuntu-offtopic room
2008-04-20T19:49:00.000Z	sdakak	Jack_Sparrow	relocating :(
