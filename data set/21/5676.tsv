2007-11-07T11:08:00.000Z	SkareCrow		I also had a question about eth0. I have no clue what it is. eth1 is my gigabit NIC, and eth2 is my 10/100 NIC, but eth0 is just there...
2007-11-07T11:09:00.000Z	Frogzoo_	SkareCrow	there won't be eth0 there without a real interface - maybe lspci will show it?
2007-11-07T11:10:00.000Z	SkareCrow	Frogzoo_	I think its my onboard, but I thought I disabled that...
2007-11-07T11:10:00.000Z	Frogzoo_	SkareCrow	well apparently not
2007-11-07T11:10:00.000Z	SkareCrow	Frogzoo_	Never mind... I redid my bios, forgot to turn that off. I wonder if turning it off would fix my other problem.
2007-11-07T11:11:00.000Z	SkareCrow	Frogzoo_	Did you get my other question?
2007-11-07T11:12:00.000Z	SkareCrow	Frogzoo_	My other interfaces will not go up automatically. I have to manually ifup them... After a new install I have to add them to my /etc/networking/interfaces config in order to use them.
2007-11-07T11:12:00.000Z	Frogzoo_	SkareCrow	well if interfaces is correct after the upgrade, where's the problem?
2007-11-07T11:13:00.000Z	SkareCrow	Frogzoo_	I have my /etc/network/interfaces set up, but I still have to manually ifup them
2007-11-07T11:13:00.000Z	Frogzoo_	SkareCrow	you probly need 'auto eth1' or similiar in there
2007-11-07T11:13:00.000Z	SkareCrow	Frogzoo_	I might be missing something in my config
2007-11-07T11:13:00.000Z	SkareCrow	Frogzoo_	That just hit me too... That is what I was thinking of. :P
2007-11-07T11:14:00.000Z	SkareCrow	Frogzoo_	All this time and until I actually think about my config do I actually realize what the problem is.
2007-11-07T11:14:00.000Z	SkareCrow	Frogzoo_	Well thanks, even though it hit me right before you answered, without you I dought I would have actually thought about it. :) Thanks for the help.
2007-11-07T11:15:00.000Z	SkareCrow	Frogzoo_	It is also possible to change the name of the interfaces. For example... From eth2 to eth1 and eth2 to eth1.. Do you know how to do this? I have done it once, but forgot what I did.
2007-11-07T11:16:00.000Z	Frogzoo_	SkareCrow	/etc/iftab
2007-11-07T11:16:00.000Z	SkareCrow	Frogzoo_	The file doesn't exist. Do I have to create it? If so I will just look up the format.
2007-11-07T11:17:00.000Z	Frogzoo_	SkareCrow	man iftab
2007-11-07T11:17:00.000Z	SkareCrow	Frogzoo_	Thanks
2007-11-07T11:17:00.000Z	SkareCrow	Frogzoo_	No man for it.
2007-11-07T11:17:00.000Z	SkareCrow	Frogzoo_	I just looked it up on google. I will read that.
