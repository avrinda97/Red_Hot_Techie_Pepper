2010-07-27T23:59:00.000Z	rawrmage		Can someone help me fix some package problems? I get http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/AwcR6pMv when I install something. I've already tried dpkg --configure -a and apt-get install -f
2010-07-28T00:01:00.000Z	rawrmage		actually in full I get http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/yTgRSRYh
2010-07-28T00:01:00.000Z	Sevith	rawrmage	clear your apt cache and retry
2010-07-28T00:02:00.000Z	Sevith	rawrmage	dependency problems - leaving unconfigured
2010-07-28T00:02:00.000Z	rawrmage	Sevith	Yep. It's a file/directory not found, but I don't know what it is missing...
2010-07-28T00:03:00.000Z	Sevith	rawrmage	Double check all your dependencies  File dir not found probably because the dependency doesnt exist
2010-07-28T00:03:00.000Z	rawrmage	Sevith	I have the dependencies: the first packages' python scripts are crashing and burning, so the things that depend on them don't configure because their dependencies die
2010-07-28T00:04:00.000Z	Sevith	rawrmage	, sudo apt-get install python <--Doesnt work?
2010-07-28T00:05:00.000Z	rawrmage	Sevith	python is already the newest version
2010-07-28T00:06:00.000Z	Sevith	rawrmage	Like i said *  Package python-pyatspi2 is not installed* Double check that you have dependencies for all your dependencies ....Your missing sh!t
2010-07-28T00:06:00.000Z	Sevith	rawrmage	You have errors everywhere sayings your missing dependencies so double check them all.
2010-07-28T00:07:00.000Z	Sevith	rawrmage	like i said..
2010-07-28T00:07:00.000Z	Sevith	rawrmage	Like i said *  Package python-pyatspi2 is not installed* Double check that you have dependencies for all your dependencies ....Your missing sh!t
2010-07-28T00:07:00.000Z	rawrmage	Sevith	yeah, working on it
2010-07-28T00:13:00.000Z	Sevith	rawrmage	do sudo apt-get install python-tz python-ubuntuone-client ubuntuone-client telepathy-butterfly ubuntuone-client-gnome libubuntuone-1.0-1 python-ubuntuone python-distutils-extra python-pyatspi ubuntuone-client-tools gnome-orca python-pyatspi2 python-wxversion python-wxgtk2.8 gtkwhiteboard python-wxgtk2.6 gtkwhiteboard
2010-07-28T00:13:00.000Z	Sevith	rawrmage	That should fix alot of your issues.
2010-07-28T00:15:00.000Z	rawrmage	Sevith	those are installed, but it does not configure, because it depends on python-pyatspi2, which *does not exist*
2010-07-28T00:15:00.000Z	rawrmage	Sevith	yes
2010-07-28T00:15:00.000Z	Sevith	rawrmage	If your on lucic install it manually
2010-07-28T00:16:00.000Z	Sevith	rawrmage	like the bot said that dependency does not exist in lucid you will have to install it manually then..
2010-07-28T00:16:00.000Z	Sevith	rawrmage	or find a repository with that package in it and add it to your sources
