2010-12-18T04:21:00.000Z	R1cochet		been on it for a few years
2010-12-18T04:22:00.000Z	R1cochet		anyone have experience using raid? i was thinking about setting one up
2010-12-18T04:24:00.000Z	R1cochet		some linux package that will setup raid for you
2010-12-18T04:26:00.000Z	R1cochet		as is i have 2 1.5tb drives, one internal other external
2010-12-18T04:26:00.000Z	R1cochet		will i be able to setup a raid1 w/ that config? or do i need to move external to internal
2010-12-18T04:27:00.000Z	R1cochet		yea im not spending $300 on a raid card and was reading that the cheaper ones are fakeraid
2010-12-18T04:27:00.000Z	R1cochet		raid 1
2010-12-18T04:28:00.000Z	R1cochet		but i have a few questions
2010-12-18T04:28:00.000Z	R1cochet		ahh but i do dual boot
2010-12-18T04:28:00.000Z	R1cochet		however the drives to be raided are ext3 so winblows will never see them
2010-12-18T04:29:00.000Z	histo	R1cochet	you can install ext3 readers in windwos
2010-12-18T04:29:00.000Z	R1cochet	histo	i know but i dont want windows to have tha capability
2010-12-18T04:29:00.000Z	histo	R1cochet	it won't out of the box be able to read ext3
2010-12-18T04:30:00.000Z	histo	R1cochet	i'm kind of confused then nvm

2010-12-18T04:51:00.000Z	histo	R1cochet	the navigation keys in vim or vi is jkl
2010-12-18T04:51:00.000Z	histo	R1cochet	hjkl

2010-12-18T04:52:00.000Z	histo	R1cochet	it's made so that you fingers stay on the home row while you use it. To change text you have to hit i for insert mode etc...
