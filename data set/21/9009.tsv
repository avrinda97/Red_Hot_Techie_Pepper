2005-12-04T14:06:00.000Z	topyli	nubs0r	there was this finnish linux distro. "best linux". very easy to remember :)
2005-12-04T14:07:00.000Z	topyli	nubs0r	oh the g in gnome is very important. it's the same g as in gnu
2005-12-04T14:07:00.000Z	nubs0r	topyli	might as well make it silent.
2005-12-04T14:08:00.000Z	nubs0r	topyli	ever hear programmers call a character in C/C++  a "char"
2005-12-04T14:08:00.000Z	topyli	nubs0r	ever hear gnome programmers what the g is supposed to sound like? =)
2005-12-04T14:09:00.000Z	topyli	nubs0r	actually he's from the swedish-speaking minority. so, linus is lee-noos.
2005-12-04T14:09:00.000Z	topyli	nubs0r	therefore, linux is lee-nooks :)
2005-12-04T14:10:00.000Z	topyli	nubs0r	i'd prefer everything be finnish
2005-12-04T14:10:00.000Z	nubs0r	topyli	are you finnish?
