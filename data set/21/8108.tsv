2007-06-17T08:57:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan		whats the command to get rid of the \r\n's ? from a  Win machine? unixdoc2 to that effect?
2007-06-17T08:59:00.000Z	Pelo	CaptainMorgan	maybe if you rephrase your question someone will know what you are talking about
2007-06-17T09:00:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	Pelo	transferring a file from a win machine to ubuntu, vice versa, and opening a plain text/html whatever... gives it an unngodly amount of spacing vertically
2007-06-17T09:00:00.000Z	Pelo	CaptainMorgan	ok I get what you want but I have no idea
2007-06-17T09:00:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	Pelo	EnsignRedshirt_ either win or linux puts \n\r on the end of each line.. I forget.. but there is a command line utitility(standard) that removes them the document
2007-06-17T09:02:00.000Z	Pelo	CaptainMorgan	search the forum for "removing /r/n"
2007-11-24T06:06:00.000Z	Pelo	CaptainMorgan	check in the FF prefs,  for default actions,  remove what ever you have listed for php files
2007-11-24T06:07:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	Pelo	I doubt it's FF related..
2007-11-24T06:08:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	Pelo	but just in case, where do I check? I just review the prefs.. and don't see anything pertaining to php
2007-11-24T06:08:00.000Z	Pelo	CaptainMorgan	yeah, you are probably right , and checking anyway might hurt like the dickens
2007-11-24T06:08:00.000Z	Pelo	CaptainMorgan	in FF under edit > prefs , check the various taps
2007-11-24T06:08:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	Pelo	what does "dont' see anything pertaiing to php" mean to yoU?
2007-11-24T06:09:00.000Z	Pelo	CaptainMorgan	 in FF , in the prefs, under content,  last button near the botom , file typs , see in there
2007-11-24T06:10:00.000Z	Pelo	CaptainMorgan	if there isnT' anything in there,  I can only recommend you check in the forum or ask in #firefox
2007-11-24T06:10:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	Pelo	there's no PHP selection
2008-04-25T07:05:00.000Z	Pelo	CaptainMorgan	sorry to hear that
