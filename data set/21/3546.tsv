2008-11-28T05:34:00.000Z	snuitje	LAquatique_	it's manual, resize and use available space or use entire disk
2008-11-28T05:34:00.000Z	LAquatique_	snuitje	yes I was talking abotu the "use available space" option
2008-11-28T05:43:00.000Z	snuitje	LAquatique_	it's snuitje -_-
2008-11-28T05:43:00.000Z	LAquatique_	snuitje	Ah, sorry, I must have read it wrong. My apologies- was having trouble reading it.
2008-11-28T05:44:00.000Z	snuitje	LAquatique_	thas ok, it's dutch
2008-11-28T05:45:00.000Z	LAquatique_	snuitje	ah, well I understand, people misspell my name all the time too. So, will "use available space" for sure not delete my data?
2008-11-28T05:46:00.000Z	snuitje	LAquatique_	i think so but i broke my browser, so i cant find references
2008-11-28T05:46:00.000Z	snuitje	LAquatique_	theres an install guide online though, google 'installing ubuntu' and you'll find it
2008-11-28T05:47:00.000Z	LAquatique_	snuitje	oh, okay. Sorry if I was seeming impatient. The idea of losing my data stresses me out. I will go read the install guide. Thanks so much for your help
2008-11-28T05:48:00.000Z	snuitje	LAquatique_	no worries, before the installer does anything, it'll tell you what's its going to do
2008-11-28T05:48:00.000Z	snuitje	LAquatique_	so better check that
2008-11-28T05:48:00.000Z	LAquatique_	snuitje	yes it seemed to imply that data might be erased so i chickened out
2008-11-28T05:49:00.000Z	snuitje	LAquatique_	if it says 'remove partition #1' or so, then yeah, go back and change it
2008-11-28T05:49:00.000Z	LAquatique_	snuitje	so it should not be removing any partitions?
2008-11-28T05:49:00.000Z	snuitje	LAquatique_	not in the common resize-windows-and-install-behind-it scenario, no
2008-11-28T05:50:00.000Z	LAquatique_	snuitje	okay, I see that according to the guide you mentioned I was doing it wrong
2008-11-28T05:51:00.000Z	snuitje	LAquatique_	ok, when you're in the live cd btw, clicking system > help and support will get you the manual as well
2008-11-28T05:51:00.000Z	LAquatique_	snuitje	great
2008-11-28T05:51:00.000Z	LAquatique_	snuitje	I think I can figure it out from here. I need to backup my main files too so that there's no chance of something bad happened
2008-11-28T05:53:00.000Z	snuitje	LAquatique_	allright, have fun and take care :)
2008-11-28T05:53:00.000Z	LAquatique_	snuitje	thanks- happy holidays and such
