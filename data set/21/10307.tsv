2005-04-26T16:07:00.000Z	WeirdAl		but that's not the point
2005-04-26T16:09:00.000Z	WeirdAl		The other lines say user
2005-04-26T16:09:00.000Z	WeirdAl		So I'm putting user :-\
2005-04-26T16:09:00.000Z	WeirdAl		Anyway, it lets me mount it when the umask isn't wrong.
2005-04-26T16:10:00.000Z	WeirdAl		If I do it as ext3 will I have more luck, maybe?
2005-04-26T16:11:00.000Z	WeirdAl		Yeah, made no odds.
2005-04-26T16:13:00.000Z	WeirdAl		gah
2005-04-26T16:14:00.000Z	WeirdAl		How can I format this partition as ext3?
2005-04-26T16:14:00.000Z	WeirdAl		I'd use qparted but it's shite and won't.
2005-04-26T16:14:00.000Z	WeirdAl		It'll only do ext2
2005-04-26T16:14:00.000Z	kyncani	WeirdAl	mke3fs, or tune2fs -j
2005-04-26T16:15:00.000Z	kyncani	WeirdAl	mke2fs -j  or tune2fs -j
2005-04-26T16:17:00.000Z	kyncani	WeirdAl	np :)
2005-04-26T16:23:00.000Z	kyncani	WeirdAl	-o uid=1000  i think
2005-04-26T16:24:00.000Z	WeirdAl	kyncani	In fstab?
2005-04-26T16:25:00.000Z	kyncani	WeirdAl	nope. which fs are you trying to mount ?
2005-04-26T16:27:00.000Z	kyncani	WeirdAl	that's not the way. You mount ext3 by root and change files ownership by root
2005-04-26T16:27:00.000Z	kyncani	WeirdAl	well, make some /wine/youruser directory and give youruser ownership to it
2005-04-26T16:29:00.000Z	kyncani	WeirdAl	;)
2005-04-26T16:29:00.000Z	kyncani	WeirdAl	sure you could (for the ownership thing)
2005-04-26T16:30:00.000Z	kyncani	WeirdAl	you've just made some error trying it is all
