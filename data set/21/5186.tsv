2007-12-09T04:10:00.000Z	toli__		Guys I have some problem instazlling the nvidia graphic drivers on my unbuntu
2007-12-09T04:11:00.000Z	steve_b	toli__	: are you trying to install it with apt-get?
2007-12-09T04:11:00.000Z	toli__		No I'm geting the driver .RUN from the nvidia web site
2007-12-09T04:12:00.000Z	steve_b	toli__	don't do that!  Install it with the restricted drivers program in ubuntu
2007-12-09T04:13:00.000Z	steve_b	toli__	goto system -> administration -> restricted drivers manager
2007-12-09T04:14:00.000Z	toli__	steve_b	I did and I cant use the driver
2007-12-09T04:15:00.000Z	steve_b	toli__	you need to enable the correct repositeries
2007-12-09T04:16:00.000Z	toli__	steve_b	I'm enableing the driver and it says that 'is not enabled'
2007-12-09T04:16:00.000Z	steve_b	toli__	you need to go to System -> administration -> software sources  and enable Proprietray drievers for devices
2007-12-09T04:17:00.000Z	steve_b	toli__	Then try and enable the driver again
2007-12-09T04:19:00.000Z	toli__	steve_b	I clicked on the Proprietary drivers for devices (restricted), so what now ?
2007-12-09T04:19:00.000Z	steve_b	toli__	try and enable the driver again in the restricted drivers again
2007-12-09T04:20:00.000Z	toli__		I got the same error steve_b
2007-12-09T04:21:00.000Z	steve_b	toli__	I enabled everything on the 'Ubuntu Software' tab on Software sources, and then I could install the restricted driver for my nVidia card...
2007-12-09T04:22:00.000Z	toli__		ah ok Steve_b I will enable all
2007-12-09T04:22:00.000Z	steve_b	toli__	- one more thing.  If you type my name at the start of the line of text it shows up a different colour and I can see you easier!
2007-12-09T04:23:00.000Z	toli__	steve_b	It works, I will need to restart I will get back again after restart, thanks
2007-12-09T04:24:00.000Z	steve_b	toli__	well done!
