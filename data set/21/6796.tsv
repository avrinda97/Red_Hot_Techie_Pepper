2007-01-26T11:37:00.000Z	bmk		i cant get ubuntu to load
2007-01-26T11:37:00.000Z	shatrat	bmk	the install CD?
2007-01-26T11:44:00.000Z	shatrat	bmk	yes you can, but one step at a time :)
2007-01-26T11:49:00.000Z	shatrat	bmk	you have a partition for windows, 2 for linux, and you choose which one to boot when you turn on computer at Grub menu
2007-01-26T11:49:00.000Z	shatrat	bmk	Ive had 3 OSes on a 40 gig drive before, its not hard
2007-01-26T11:50:00.000Z	shatrat	bmk	Defrag your windows first.  Then you can use the Livecd to resize windows and install ubuntu on the free space
2007-01-26T11:54:00.000Z	shatrat	bmk	because burning at a fast speed often causes errors.
2007-01-26T11:54:00.000Z	shatrat	bmk	errors in an audio disk are no big deal, but in an install disk they are a seriously big deal
2007-01-26T11:56:00.000Z	shatrat	bmk	try youtube.  search for gnome, kde, beryl
2007-01-26T11:58:00.000Z	shatrat	bmk	Yeah I read about something like that, cant remember the name of it
2007-01-26T12:02:00.000Z	shatrat	bmk	Id rather buy from system76 if I bought a pre-made
2007-01-26T12:04:00.000Z	shatrat	bmk	there is an automatic tool for partitioning and there is a manual partitioner
2007-01-26T12:04:00.000Z	shatrat	bmk	Just make sure you defrag first
2007-01-26T12:05:00.000Z	shatrat	bmk	on the LiveCD there is an icon that says Install.  Click that and it takes you through step by step
2007-01-26T12:06:00.000Z	shatrat	bmk	swap is for the pagefile.  so it cant possibly get fragmented like in windows
2007-01-26T12:07:00.000Z	shatrat	bmk	no, thats why youre gonna partition it.  Ther will be an NTFS part for windows, an Ext3 part for linux, and a little swap
2007-01-26T12:12:00.000Z	shatrat	bmk	it will take you through some menus and let you pick your language and stuff and then install that mother
2007-01-26T12:25:00.000Z	shatrat	bmk	something wrong in teh boot order I assume
2007-01-26T12:32:00.000Z	shatrat	bmk	sounds like you chose the wrong keyboard type
2007-01-26T12:33:00.000Z	shatrat	bmk	arent you in windows still?
2007-01-26T15:50:00.000Z	shatrat	bmk	try burning with a different program.  I don't know about this infra stuff. I use deepburner, its free
