2007-06-23T16:07:00.000Z	Flannel	Ubuntoo	please stop
2007-06-23T16:16:00.000Z	Flannel	Ubuntoo	you're escalating your privledges to do administrative tasks
2007-06-23T16:17:00.000Z	Flannel	Ubuntoo	you don't want to.  sudo is the way to go
2007-06-23T16:19:00.000Z	Flannel	Ubuntoo	It caches your password for 10 minutes, so you only have to do it whn you haven't used it for 10 minutes.  To open a file browser with higher privs, alt-f2 (that's the run dialog), then `gksu nautilus`, and close that window AS SOON AS you're done.
2007-06-23T16:20:00.000Z	Flannel	Ubuntoo	With windows, anyone is able to edit anything, it's very insecure, it's why viruses and stuff can easily spread and do damage, because they have the ability to modify any files they want.
2007-06-23T16:27:00.000Z	Flannel	Ubuntoo	are you running Kubuntu? Xubuntu? or Ubuntu?
2007-06-23T16:30:00.000Z	Flannel	Ubuntoo	What?  What are you trying to do?
2007-06-23T16:34:00.000Z	Ubuntoo	Flannel	To open a file browser with higher privs, alt-f2 (that's the run dialog), then `gksu nautilus`, and close that window AS SOON AS you're done. where i can found it, my F keys doesn't work. :(
2007-06-23T16:35:00.000Z	Flannel	Ubuntoo	alt-f2 should work.  Well, unless your F keys dont.  In that case, try installing `nautilus-gksu` that might do what you want (albeit in a different manner)
2007-06-23T16:39:00.000Z	Ubuntoo	Flannel	same thing, i can't edit folders directly, with copy/delete commands, only with right-click - set permissions ...
2007-06-23T16:41:00.000Z	Flannel	Ubuntoo	You don't want to set permissions.  That's bad.  Go to accessories > terminal, and then type in `gksu nautilus` (then edit/close/etc).  Since you can't use altf2 for whatever reason
