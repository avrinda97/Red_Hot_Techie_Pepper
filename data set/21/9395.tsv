2006-08-14T06:21:00.000Z	todd		There's several different process numbers, and the error keeps repeating in the Terminal, while doing apt-install of gnome-desktop.
2006-08-14T06:22:00.000Z	todd		What does that mean to me? Something is broken... didnt install right? or..
2006-08-14T06:22:00.000Z	todd		Hmm.
2006-08-14T06:22:00.000Z	todd		Wonder if its bad lol.
2006-08-14T06:23:00.000Z	todd		Haven't tried it yet, still in KDE.
2006-08-14T06:23:00.000Z	todd		Have a few torrents going.
2006-08-14T06:23:00.000Z	todd		umm. just a sec.
2006-08-14T06:23:00.000Z	todd		Setting up gnome-desktop-environment (2.12.2.3) ...
2006-08-14T06:24:00.000Z	todd		That IS what I installed. Argh, Should have done ubuntu-desktop?
2006-08-14T06:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic	todd	it's usual
2006-08-14T06:25:00.000Z	thoreauputic	todd	but installing that package shouldn't break anything afaik :)
2006-08-14T06:25:00.000Z	thoreauputic	todd	just install ubuntu-desktop - that should get you a standard Ubuntu gnome
2006-08-14T06:26:00.000Z	thoreauputic	todd	did you install Ubuntu or Kubuntu or what ?
2006-08-14T06:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	todd	apt/synaptic is pretty smart - it shoud take care of you :)
2006-08-14T06:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	todd	then just install ubuntu-desktop
2006-08-14T06:43:00.000Z	todd	thoreauputic	what does that do?
2006-08-14T06:43:00.000Z	thoreauputic	todd	drops you to a black screen with a prompt :)
2006-08-14T06:44:00.000Z	thoreauputic	todd	you can easily gey back with sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start though
2006-08-14T06:44:00.000Z	thoreauputic	todd	try listening to Mozart - it increases your IQ ;-)
2006-08-14T06:45:00.000Z	thoreauputic	todd	there you go - that's your problem rigt there ;P
