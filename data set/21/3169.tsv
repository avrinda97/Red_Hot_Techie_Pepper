2009-03-18T22:02:00.000Z	ubuntu_problemos		hey desperate for help on the partition front folks. i've cloned my drive with dd to a bigger one, but now there's loads of unallocated space after the swap in gparted from livecd and i can't expand into it?? please help
2009-03-18T22:03:00.000Z	ubuntu_problemos		i'm using the livecd now. my clone worked great, tried it and it all booted etc. but in gparted now on livecd and can't make the partition bigger. it's got sda1 as my main partition, then sda2 extended with swap on and then a ton of unallocated after that...
2009-03-18T22:04:00.000Z	scunizi	ubuntu_problemos	you have to allocate the space first.. format and then move things around.. unless it's swap...in which case you move swap to the end first so the unallocated space is next to what you want to make larger.
2009-03-18T22:04:00.000Z	ubuntu_problemos	scunizi	how or what do i allocated it to? i tried making it another ext3 but that doesnt seem to help
2009-03-18T22:05:00.000Z	ubuntu_problemos	scunizi	it seems to make it as sda3, but not add it to sda1...
2009-03-18T22:06:00.000Z	scunizi	ubuntu_problemos	if swap is going to be between the unallocated space and what ever is at the beginning of the drive then create a new swap and change fstab to reflect that.. then on next boot you can delete the old swap partition so that space merges with the current unallocated space.. from there you might be able to just "expand" what's at the beginning of the drive (ext3?).. without formatting
2009-03-18T22:07:00.000Z	ubuntu_problemos	scunizi	how do i get the swap to the end of the drive though?
2009-03-18T22:09:00.000Z	scunizi	ubuntu_problemos	with gparted or partition manager (the same program) .. use it to create new space at the end formatted as swap.. edit /etc/fstab to reflect swaps new partition designation.. and then use gparted again to delete the old swap partition
2009-03-18T22:09:00.000Z	ubuntu_problemos	scunizi	but it says my swap now is Extended, whatever that is... but when i copy and paste the swap to unallocated it's not extended...
2009-03-18T22:10:00.000Z	scunizi	ubuntu_problemos	how many partitions on this secondary drive?
2009-03-18T22:11:00.000Z	ubuntu_problemos	scunizi	i've only got one drive in the machine. the cloned one. it's 1tb.
2009-03-18T22:11:00.000Z	scunizi	ubuntu_problemos	ok.. how many partitions on that drive?
2009-03-18T22:11:00.000Z	ubuntu_problemos	scunizi	and it has sda1 and sda2 on it, sda2 is extended and within that there's a swap
2009-03-18T22:11:00.000Z	ubuntu_problemos	scunizi	then a load of unallocated after it
2009-03-18T22:12:00.000Z	scunizi	ubuntu_problemos	ok.. that makes sense now.. don't copy and paste the swap partition to the unallocated space. simply create a new partition at the END of the drive for a new swap.
2009-03-18T22:13:00.000Z	scunizi	ubuntu_problemos	1 gig ought to be enough
2009-03-18T22:14:00.000Z	ubuntu_problemos	scunizi	ah cracked it! i've made the swap fill the unallocated, then reduced it to be at end of unallocated, then resized the sda1 to fill the bit in middle! sweet
2009-03-18T22:14:00.000Z	ubuntu_problemos	scunizi	thanks for the help
2009-03-18T22:14:00.000Z	scunizi	ubuntu_problemos	glad it worked out
2009-03-18T22:15:00.000Z	ubuntu_problemos	scunizi	it's renamed my swap to sda5 strangely though. so should i change my fstab?
2009-03-18T22:16:00.000Z	scunizi	ubuntu_problemos	yes
