2006-05-14T05:36:00.000Z	amimusa		hi again, I still have the mount problem. You can check here: http://pastebin.com/707146 if you want to try to help. Thank you very much for your try
2006-05-14T05:38:00.000Z	zm0	amimusa	sudo chown amimusa:amimusa /media/usbDev
2006-05-14T05:39:00.000Z	amimusa	zm0	but like that only the user amimusa will access... it's strange... first time I get this... usually I plug it and it works fine ...
2006-05-14T05:40:00.000Z	zm0	amimusa	is it fat32 ? you shouldn't need an entry in your fstab for hotpluggable devices
2006-05-14T05:43:00.000Z	zm0	amimusa	maybe try to rebuild your file system on the device: sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sdaX
2006-05-14T05:44:00.000Z	zm0	amimusa	yeah, you should back it up first somewhere
2006-05-14T05:46:00.000Z	zm0	amimusa	plugin the device and then pastebin the output of dmesg |tail
2006-05-14T05:52:00.000Z	amimusa	zm0	it's strange... isn't it ?
2006-05-14T05:52:00.000Z	zm0	amimusa	are you using a usb hub?
2006-05-14T05:56:00.000Z	amimusa	zm0	any other suggestion ?
2006-05-14T05:57:00.000Z	zm0	amimusa	pastebin your dmesg | tail output, or did you already do that?
2006-05-14T05:58:00.000Z	zm0	amimusa	in your fstab you refer to sda1 but when your device is /dev/sdbx
