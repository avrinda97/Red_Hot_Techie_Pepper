2007-09-19T14:33:00.000Z	kalmah		Hi, my sound in ubuntu has a lot of static. What could cause this?
2007-09-19T14:33:00.000Z	marx2k	kalmah	bad grounding?
2007-09-19T14:33:00.000Z	kalmah	marx2k	it worked fine in windows, this is a fresh install of ubuntu
2007-09-19T14:34:00.000Z	marx2k	kalmah	when does the static occur?
2007-09-19T14:34:00.000Z	kalmah	marx2k	when any sound plays. all i hear is static and a hint of what should be playing
2007-09-19T14:35:00.000Z	marx2k	kalmah	in terminal, type "alsamixer" and try bringing the PCM volume down until the static goes away and bring the  master up
2007-09-19T14:37:00.000Z	kalmah	marx2k	tried that. i still get static when PCM is at 2. Also, master volume doesn't change the sound volume at all for me
2007-09-19T14:37:00.000Z	kalmah	marx2k	94% master and 2% master has the same volume
2007-09-19T14:37:00.000Z	marx2k	kalmah	id play around in alsamixer .. baybe turn the bass down?
2007-09-19T14:37:00.000Z	marx2k		maybe
2007-09-19T14:38:00.000Z	kalmah	marx2k	it's possible it co uld be because i have 2 sounds cards (onboard and pci), but i have the pci one set to my default card
2007-09-19T14:39:00.000Z	marx2k	kalmah	perhaps... maybe disable the onboard card in the bios? Though that really shouldnt be the case
2007-09-19T14:39:00.000Z	marx2k		I have a bit of trouble with static as well in linux when the volume gets high on any audio output
2007-09-19T14:40:00.000Z	kalmah		what has me confused is no matter what i do with the master volume setting.. the volume stays the same
2007-09-19T14:40:00.000Z	marx2k		thats pribably because PCM is way down
2007-09-19T14:40:00.000Z	marx2k		probably
2007-09-19T14:41:00.000Z	kalmah		yeah i played around with PCM, and it has no effect on volume either
2007-09-19T14:41:00.000Z	kalmah		Well, if i turn PCM to 0.. there is no volume. that's about it
2007-09-19T14:41:00.000Z	marx2k		ok i gots to sleep :/
2007-09-19T14:42:00.000Z	kalmah		but if i set master volume to 0, i still have sound.. lol
2007-09-19T14:42:00.000Z	marx2k	kalmah	arent there other settings to play with in alsamixer?
