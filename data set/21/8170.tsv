2006-07-30T06:57:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Anderson	some modems are sort of like routers and have similar functionality ( mine does )
2006-07-30T06:57:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Anderson	for instance I can port-forward and it does nat etc
2006-07-30T07:00:00.000Z	Anderson	thoreauputic	I've never seen that before, who is your service provider?
2006-07-30T07:01:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Anderson	optusnet ( Australian)
2006-07-30T07:03:00.000Z	Anderson	thoreauputic	How old is your modem, and is that a Web interface or a CLI (Telnet, ssh?)
2006-07-30T07:04:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Anderson	recent - Siemens 4200 , and it has a web interface at 10.1.1.1
2006-07-30T07:09:00.000Z	Anderson	thoreauputic	have you built a kernel?
2006-07-30T07:09:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Anderson	no, I just use the images so far - I haven't needed to compile a kernel yet
2006-07-30T07:10:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Anderson	I compile other stuff though - fluxbox for example, and modules for my iBook to use mac-on-linux etc
2006-07-30T07:17:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Anderson	I don't understand what you mean by the kernel repository...
2006-07-30T07:18:00.000Z	Anderson	thoreauputic	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelGitGuide under the Getting the rep section
2006-07-30T07:19:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Anderson	ah, you're using vanilla kernels from the git pool ? I don't know about that ( I know of it but I haven't tried it)
2006-07-30T07:20:00.000Z	Anderson	thoreauputic	as far as apt-get is concerned, is the repository the storage location of the debian packages for a certain release, etc (i forget what the restricted / universe thing is called)
2006-07-30T07:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Anderson	repositories are collections of .deb packages, yes
2006-07-30T07:21:00.000Z	Anderson	thoreauputic	maybe it's the collection of the kernel... source files maybe?
2006-07-30T07:21:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Anderson	as I understand it, "git" is Linus's access tool for kernel source code
2006-07-30T07:23:00.000Z	Anderson	thoreauputic	originally there were some other kernel building tools config, menuconfig, and xconfig
2006-07-30T07:23:00.000Z	Anderson	thoreauputic	git is ubuntu's solution
2006-07-30T07:23:00.000Z	Anderson	thoreauputic	http://www.linux.org/lessons/interm/c2496.html
2006-07-30T07:26:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Anderson	no, "git" was written by Linus Torvalds
