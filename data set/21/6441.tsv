2007-06-10T15:07:00.000Z	ROnewbie		Anyone, I'LL PAY $30 by paypal to whomever can help me with my wireless; in brief, Network Manager won't connect to any wireless networks. Running Feisty on an MSI S271X laptop with RT61 card (ralink). Newrk Mngr "sees" all the networks allright, won't connect. I'm sure card is installed. Again, 30 bucks for this one.
2007-06-10T15:09:00.000Z	zipper	ROnewbie	you really shouldnt have to pay for help. If someone is online who can help you, i'm sure they will.
2007-06-10T15:10:00.000Z	ROnewbie	zipper	I know, but this has been going for a month now ... I really hate having to use WinXP, so i'm really willing to pay for this.
2007-06-10T15:10:00.000Z	zipper	ROnewbie	i know what you mean.... i had to give up running linux on my laptop, due to wireless issues.
2007-06-10T15:11:00.000Z	zipper	ROnewbie	i suppose you've already searched the ubuntu wiki for clues?
2007-06-10T15:12:00.000Z	ROnewbie	zipper	yes, 3 times over. There's a whole page dedicated to RT61, but it hasn't helped. Most of it is about how to blacklist it, install it, a.s.o. Mine is already on, I'm SURE it's just some settings thing, but It doesn't seem to work
2007-06-10T15:12:00.000Z	zipper	ROnewbie	are you able to connect to any wireless networks? i.e. networks without any encryption?
2007-06-10T15:14:00.000Z	zipper	ROnewbie	but to be honest... there is really only so much you can do. If you've tried following the guide without luck, i dont see much choice for you. Either write a better driver yourself, live without wireless, or go back to windows =/
2007-06-10T15:15:00.000Z	ROnewbie	zipper	no, I can't connect to any of them, encrypted or not
2007-06-10T15:15:00.000Z	zipper	ROnewbie	i'm not familiar with your card... perhaps you could try using ndiswrapper (if you arent already)
2007-06-10T15:15:00.000Z	ROnewbie	zipper	although NM sees which are encrypted and which are not, and asks for the passwords
2007-06-10T15:16:00.000Z	zipper	ROnewbie	hmm, wierd
2007-06-10T15:16:00.000Z	ROnewbie	zipper	well, I would be tempted to, were it not for the fact that it seems installed already. I also picked this particular kind of laptop because it is very open source friendly.
2007-06-10T15:16:00.000Z	ROnewbie	zipper	and it was, completely, Except for this it worked perfectly
2007-06-10T15:17:00.000Z	zipper	ROnewbie	hmmm... sure would be a bitch not to get it working then. While ndiswrapper has a lot of bugs and glitches, it might be worth a try?
2007-06-10T15:19:00.000Z	ROnewbie	zipper	Only used it once before, on another laptop; not sure how to use it again. Plus, what if it's all about some incredibly dumb thing I didn't do .. I don't know, check a box or something, or add a line of code in DH Client or whatever ... I'm just afraid I'll screw it up even more.
2007-06-10T15:21:00.000Z	zipper	ROnewbie	well... as i said, i'm not familiar with your wireless chip. But you can detect wireless networks, but no being able to connect to them just seems wierd and leads me to believe its a driver problem.
2007-06-10T15:23:00.000Z	ROnewbie	zipper	hmm .... let me get this straight. Ndiswrapper takes the firmware that is needed from a non-open source driver provided by my laptop maker; it installs this driver. If it still doesn't work, can I unde this ?
2007-06-10T15:24:00.000Z	zipper	ROnewbie	to be honest, i havent played around with ndiswrapper too much. But basicly, i've used it to run windows drivers under linux. There should be no need to change firmware.
2007-06-10T15:25:00.000Z	ROnewbie	zipper	well, thanks for the help. I'll give it another try find someone to help around here, and if not I'll give ndiswrapper a chance.
2007-06-10T15:25:00.000Z	zipper	ROnewbie	it wasnt really helping, but np. Good luck.
