2008-12-07T21:30:00.000Z	ackbahr		Hi! I'm SSH-ing my computer at home and I need to mount a windows partition... Can someone help me?
2008-12-07T21:31:00.000Z	joaopinto	ackbahr	install and use smbmount
2008-12-07T21:31:00.000Z	ackbahr	joaopinto	This is non graphical?
2008-12-07T21:32:00.000Z	joaopinto	ackbahr	yes, it's a command line utility to mount samba shares
2008-12-07T21:32:00.000Z	ackbahr	joaopinto	And I'm not aiming at distant mounting, you can imagine I'm stuck with console and no X....
2008-12-07T21:33:00.000Z	ackbahr	joaopinto	Just like my windows partition (on the same computer!) can be mounted from inside Ubuntu
2008-12-07T21:33:00.000Z	joaopinto	ackbahr	like I said, use smbmount ;)
2008-12-07T21:34:00.000Z	ackbahr	joaopinto	Ok, thanks
2008-12-07T21:34:00.000Z	ackbahr	joaopinto	Packet doesn't exist
2008-12-07T21:35:00.000Z	joaopinto	ackbahr	sorry, it's provided by the smbfs package
2008-12-07T21:42:00.000Z	ackbahr	joaopinto	Well, if I had figured out earlier that it was /dev/sda1 and NOT /dev/hda1....
2009-04-28T14:47:00.000Z	joaopinto	ackbahr	are you using some kind of USB hub ?
2009-04-28T14:47:00.000Z	ackbahr	joaopinto	No, right into the computer
2009-04-28T14:48:00.000Z	joaopinto	ackbahr	have you tested the speed wit hdparm -t ?
2009-04-28T14:48:00.000Z	ackbahr	joaopinto	The speeds I mentionned earlier are those given by hdparm
2009-04-28T14:49:00.000Z	joaopinto	ackbahr	ah ok :\
2009-04-28T14:51:00.000Z	ackbahr	joaopinto	No idea then?
2009-04-28T14:51:00.000Z	ackbahr	joaopinto	Could it be a swap or CPU or RAM or linear combination of the aforementionned?
2009-04-28T14:52:00.000Z	ackbahr	joaopinto	...issue?
2009-04-28T14:52:00.000Z	joaopinto	ackbahr	not likely, if that was case you would feel a terrible performance on the overall system use
2009-04-28T14:55:00.000Z	ackbahr	joaopinto	Which is indeed not the case....
