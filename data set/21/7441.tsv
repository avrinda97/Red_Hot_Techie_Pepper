2006-09-29T08:55:00.000Z	sethk	EvanIsaac	drivers are just files, and can be erased.
2006-09-29T08:57:00.000Z	sethk	EvanIsaac	don't panic, it won't get you anywhere
2006-09-29T08:58:00.000Z	sethk	EvanIsaac	then type calm letters.  :)  I'm not sure where you are, exactly, but as I already said, you can delete drivers, which is what you most recently asked
2006-09-29T09:26:00.000Z	sethk	EvanIsaac	usb net + wireless = very complex
2006-09-29T09:26:00.000Z	sethk	EvanIsaac	you need the USB networking layer, and then the wireless layer on top of that
2006-09-29T09:26:00.000Z	sethk	EvanIsaac	or underneath that, really.
2006-09-29T09:27:00.000Z	sethk	EvanIsaac	I didn't say it is wasted, just that it isn't easy
2006-09-29T09:27:00.000Z	sethk	EvanIsaac	they are fine for the cases when you don't need them
2006-09-29T09:27:00.000Z	sethk	EvanIsaac	actually except for wireless, ubuntu is very easy to configure
2006-10-01T11:13:00.000Z	EvanIsaac	sethk	do you know how i can get to ndisgtk?
2006-10-01T11:13:00.000Z	sethk	EvanIsaac	no, sorry, haven't used it.
