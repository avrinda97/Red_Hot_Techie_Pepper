2008-02-21T06:13:00.000Z	ahorriblemess		I'm using Anjuntu, I wrote a program in C++ by following directions from "C++ For Dummies," I don't know how to execute it and run it now, there's no option and I've been searching for a while. Could it be a plugin?
2008-02-21T06:14:00.000Z	reikalusikka	ahorriblemess	arvauspeli.cpp -Wall -g -o arvauspeli
2008-02-21T06:14:00.000Z	ahorriblemess	reikalusikka	what is that? Should I replace "arvauspeli.cpp" with my program name?
2008-02-21T06:15:00.000Z	reikalusikka	ahorriblemess	yeah, that's my own program :D
2008-02-21T06:15:00.000Z	ahorriblemess	reikalusikka	awesome thanks, what does that do exactly if you don't my me asking?
2008-02-21T06:15:00.000Z	ahorriblemess	reikalusikka	so I copy exactly what you wrote, then do ./myprogram ?
2008-02-21T06:16:00.000Z	ahorriblemess	reikalusikka	got it, thanks!
2008-02-21T06:21:00.000Z	ahorriblemess	reikalusikka	I just did that, it said "bash: conversation.cpp: command not found"
2008-02-21T06:21:00.000Z	ahorriblemess	reikalusikka	conversation.cpp is the program
2008-02-21T06:21:00.000Z	reikalusikka	ahorriblemess	I think you have to download some library
2008-02-21T06:21:00.000Z	ahorriblemess	reikalusikka	man... ok haha.
2008-02-21T06:22:00.000Z	reikalusikka	ahorriblemess	let me check :D
2008-02-21T06:23:00.000Z	reikalusikka	ahorriblemess	type 'sudo apt-get install g++'
2008-02-21T06:24:00.000Z	ahorriblemess	reikalusikka	ok, thanks a lot for finding that out. I was looking on the anjuta site and I read something about g++ but there was a list... I got a little confused I guess. Thank you though
2008-02-21T06:24:00.000Z	reikalusikka	ahorriblemess	or you can go to synaptic packet manager and install from there
2008-02-21T06:24:00.000Z	ahorriblemess	reikalusikka	I already have it
2008-02-21T06:25:00.000Z	reikalusikka	ahorriblemess	well then go to synaptic package manager
2008-02-21T06:25:00.000Z	reikalusikka	ahorriblemess	and search for 'g++'
2008-02-21T06:25:00.000Z	ahorriblemess	reikalusikka	wait, is the command simply "$program.cpp -Wall -g -o program name" ?
2008-02-21T06:26:00.000Z	reikalusikka	ahorriblemess	yeah
2008-02-21T06:26:00.000Z	ahorriblemess	reikalusikka	ok i wanted to make sure I had it right. I'm going to be afk for a bit, thanks for the help so far I appreciate it
