2005-07-13T15:58:00.000Z	othernoob	nikkia	i hardly doubt that Wendy's cares about any of it either...
2005-07-13T15:58:00.000Z	nikkia	othernoob	well, that's true, but i doubt they care about 80wpm on dvorak either :)
2005-07-13T16:04:00.000Z	nikkia	othernoob	of dvorak? no
2005-07-13T16:04:00.000Z	nikkia	othernoob	people have tried, but its a lot of work to analyse the character usage of languages
2005-07-13T16:04:00.000Z	othernoob	nikkia	not of dvorak, i meant in general
2005-07-13T16:05:00.000Z	nikkia	othernoob	yeah, there are lots of keyboard layouts
2005-07-13T16:05:00.000Z	othernoob	nikkia	is there one for german or swedish ;)
2005-07-15T05:24:00.000Z	nikkia	othernoob	wine tries too, just not as hard
2005-07-15T05:26:00.000Z	othernoob	nikkia	I didn't know that, was told that only cedega took that step
2005-07-15T05:26:00.000Z	nikkia	othernoob	mostly, the difference is that cedega is optimised for gaming
2005-07-15T05:28:00.000Z	othernoob	nikkia	would you happen to know a NeoGeo emulator like winkawaks for linux?
2005-07-15T05:28:00.000Z	nikkia	othernoob	no idea
2005-07-16T15:28:00.000Z	nikkia	othernoob	lack of a 64bit java for a start
2005-07-16T15:28:00.000Z	othernoob	nikkia	there is 64bit java..
2005-07-16T15:28:00.000Z	nikkia	othernoob	not in the standard repositories, which is where MidNightRaVeN is looking, i imagine
2005-07-16T15:29:00.000Z	nikkia	othernoob	he?
2005-07-16T15:29:00.000Z	othernoob	nikkia	yea well, maybe should look on java.sun.com then
2005-07-16T15:29:00.000Z	othernoob	nikkia	i assume that Midnightraven is a he ;)
2005-07-16T15:29:00.000Z	nikkia	othernoob	ah, i thought you were referring to me
2005-07-16T15:29:00.000Z	nikkia	othernoob	thats not an assumption i'd make tho
2005-07-16T15:30:00.000Z	othernoob	nikkia	why? i'm pretty sure mid is a guy
