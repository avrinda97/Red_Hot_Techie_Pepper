2007-01-02T13:09:00.000Z	CarCase928		hello, every time i boot ubuntu on my laptop, just before the desktop appears, some strange colors start to appear then changes color, and then the desktop appears, when i move any app window, it's sluggish, do i need to update/install my video card drivers?
2007-01-02T13:09:00.000Z	__lonewolf	CarCase928	I have the same problem; I am not sure if its with the framebuffer or the usplash
2007-01-02T13:11:00.000Z	CarCase928	__lonewolf	i was experiencing the same problem on mdesktop, but i was able to get the problem fixed, thanks to this chat room but i completely forgot to fix this problem, i have an nvidia GeForce graphics card
2007-01-02T13:12:00.000Z	__lonewolf	CarCase928	Thats nice. So is it fixed now?
2007-01-02T13:14:00.000Z	CarCase928	__lonewolf	this happened sevral weeks ago on my desktop before i bought my laptop, but now i am experiencing this problem on my new laptop, which is built by the same company that made my desktop.
2007-01-02T13:14:00.000Z	__lonewolf	CarCase928	Oh okay
2007-01-02T13:17:00.000Z	CarCase928	__lonewolf	the only difference is, my laptop did not display those strange colors, it was only sluggish when i attempt to move an app window, but that was fixed, it was something to do with updating the nvidia driver, i am attempted to install the nvidia driver for my laptop, but that didn't solved my problem, and i can't use ubuntu until i get this sluggish problem to be fixed and those strange colors to disappearge
2007-01-02T13:17:00.000Z	CarCase928	__lonewolf	disappear
2007-01-02T13:17:00.000Z	CarCase928	__lonewolf	i meant the desktop did not show the colors
2007-01-02T13:17:00.000Z	__lonewolf	CarCase928	Oh, I know what you mean. That means your nVidia driver is not installed, thats all.
2007-01-02T13:19:00.000Z	CarCase928	__lonewolf	i installed the driver from synaptic, but those colors still show, and moving app windows, scrolling web pages....ect are still sluggish
2007-01-02T13:19:00.000Z	__lonewolf	CarCase928	If thats the only problem, apt-get install nvidia-glx should do. And if it doesn't work out, get the latest drivers from nvidia.com
2007-01-02T13:19:00.000Z	__lonewolf	CarCase928	Did you restart X after updating the driver?
2007-01-02T13:19:00.000Z	CarCase928	__lonewolf	no, i didn't, and i don't remember how
2007-01-02T13:20:00.000Z	__lonewolf	CarCase928	/etc/init.d/gdm restart
2007-01-02T13:20:00.000Z	__lonewolf	CarCase928	Go to a text  console with Ctrl F1 and run it from there.
2007-01-02T13:20:00.000Z	CarCase928	__lonewolf	ok, i'll try it, thanks
2007-01-02T13:21:00.000Z	__lonewolf	CarCase928	Good luck.
2007-01-02T13:21:00.000Z	CarCase928	__lonewolf	thanks
2007-01-02T13:21:00.000Z	__lonewolf	CarCase928	no probs
2007-01-02T13:34:00.000Z	CarCase928	__lonewolf	it didn't work
