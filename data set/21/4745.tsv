2008-12-27T22:15:00.000Z	Shpook		Hello everyone, I need some help. My daughters EeePC will connect to our wireless network, but has no internet access. There was access before, but it was in roaming mode and switched to a stronger network, and I pointed it back to our network. Now It doesn't connect to the internet. I can't ping out, and the DNS nameserver is pointed to my router correctly.
2008-12-27T22:16:00.000Z	n8tuser	Shpook	-> check if it has a good route table   route -n
2008-12-27T22:17:00.000Z	Shpook	n8tuser	There's nothing listed but the headings :/
2008-12-27T22:18:00.000Z	n8tuser	Shpook	-> that is your clue, no route, so it can not get to wherever
2008-12-27T22:18:00.000Z	Shpook	n8tuser	Now my next step is to figure out how to resolve it. :D
2008-12-27T22:19:00.000Z	n8tuser	Shpook	-> copy one from your working clients
2008-12-27T22:21:00.000Z	Shpook	n8tuser	I don't have any working clients, but I'll see what I can find with google
2008-12-27T22:21:00.000Z	Shpook	n8tuser	Thanks :D
2008-12-27T22:22:00.000Z	n8tuser	Shpook	-> those should be automatic, feed by the dhcp server
2008-12-27T22:23:00.000Z	Shpook	n8tuser	would that make it a router issue?
2008-12-27T22:24:00.000Z	n8tuser	Shpook	-> yeah
2008-12-27T22:25:00.000Z	Shpook	n8tuser	i apologize, i do have a working windows machine, it's just the ubuntu machine that doesn't work
2008-12-27T22:25:00.000Z	n8tuser	Shpook	-> in windows you use   route print
2008-12-27T22:27:00.000Z	Shpook	n8tuser	ok good, and did you mean just copy the contents, or would it have to be from another ubuntu machine?
2008-12-27T22:27:00.000Z	n8tuser	Shpook	-> you can not literally copy the contents, its the context you need to copy
2008-12-27T22:28:00.000Z	n8tuser	Shpook	-> those should be automatically performed by the dhclient
2008-12-27T22:29:00.000Z	Shpook	n8tuser	I didn't mean literally copy and paste :P well, like i said, it worked fine before i turned off roaming mode
2008-12-27T22:30:00.000Z	n8tuser	Shpook	-> you dont want roaming mode, lest you reallly are roaming
2008-12-27T22:31:00.000Z	Shpook	n8tuser	yeah, that's why i turned it off and pointed to my connection. that was the moment i lost an internet connection.
2008-12-27T22:31:00.000Z	n8tuser	Shpook	-> configure the settings accordingly once you uncheck roaming
2008-12-27T22:32:00.000Z	n8tuser	Shpook	-> should only be like the essid and use dhcp   on that nm window
