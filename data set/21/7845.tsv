2006-07-09T10:25:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	farky	did you set up firestarter properly with your network cards and everything? (i.e. internet interface, lan interface, etc...)
2006-07-09T10:30:00.000Z	farky	pppoe_dude	yeah i set up everything fine, but just trying to actually start the firewall gives that message
2006-07-09T10:33:00.000Z	farky	pppoe_dude	yeah i set up everything fine, but just trying to actually start the firewall gives that message
2006-07-09T10:34:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	farky	:- you need to make sure your interfaces are set up properly. also make sure they are both up (ifconfig)
2006-07-09T10:34:00.000Z	farky	pppoe_dude	everything looks to be working ok
2006-07-09T10:35:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	farky	can you close firestarter, then from command line type: 'sudo /etc/init.d/firestarter restart' and tell me what you get

2006-07-09T10:37:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	farky	any specific messages?

2006-07-09T10:45:00.000Z	farky	pppoe_dude	nope, no other messages
2006-07-09T10:46:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	farky	sounds like something with the network interfaces... ask around and wait and see...
