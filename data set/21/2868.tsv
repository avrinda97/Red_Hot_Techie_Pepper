2009-10-27T16:30:00.000Z	vge	Prentice	is it lsited in the "mount" list?
2009-10-27T16:30:00.000Z	Prentice	vge	no
2009-10-27T16:31:00.000Z	vge	Prentice	have your tried reentering it?
2009-10-27T16:32:00.000Z	Prentice	vge	what do you mean by that?
2009-10-27T16:32:00.000Z	vge	Prentice	remove it and put it back in? :)
2009-10-27T16:33:00.000Z	vge	Prentice	if it's not listed then it's not mounted and you can take it out
2009-10-27T16:33:00.000Z	Prentice	vge	ye loads of times
2009-10-27T16:33:00.000Z	Prentice	vge	I've taken it out but it doesn't show when I plug it back in
2009-10-27T16:35:00.000Z	Prentice	vge	I've taken it out and back in again
2009-10-27T16:36:00.000Z	vge	Prentice	donno if i can help you further, if it don't show up in mount list it's not automounting which is not right :/
2009-10-27T16:37:00.000Z	vge	Prentice	which you already knew :/
