2007-04-07T16:52:00.000Z	ATi7500		i have a strange behaviour when running sudo aptitude update
2007-04-07T16:52:00.000Z	ATi7500		almost all repositories show "hit" in front of the process
2007-04-07T16:53:00.000Z	ATi7500		hit or ign
2007-04-07T05:04:00.000Z	ATi7500		how do i restore the original sources.list file?
2007-04-07T05:05:00.000Z	bright_fame	ATi7500	what does 'locate sources.list' output?
2007-04-07T05:05:00.000Z	bright_fame	ATi7500	may give you the names of some backed up version of that file
2007-04-07T05:14:00.000Z	ATi7500	bright_fame	i have a query with you
2007-04-07T05:14:00.000Z	bright_fame	ATi7500	ask away
2007-04-07T05:16:00.000Z	ATi7500	bright_fame	can i send you my sources.list?
2007-04-07T05:17:00.000Z	bright_fame	ATi7500	paste it to http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org and give me the URL to look at it
2007-04-07T05:19:00.000Z	ATi7500	bright_fame	 http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14363/
2007-04-07T05:22:00.000Z	bright_fame	ATi7500	you wish to know how to return this file to its original state?
2007-04-07T05:22:00.000Z	ATi7500	bright_fame	yes, if it would be that the problem
2007-04-07T05:22:00.000Z	ATi7500	bright_fame	i don't understand what the "hit" means
2007-04-07T05:25:00.000Z	bright_fame	ATi7500	you could try putting a '#' infront of the last three lines, these are the three non-official repos.
2007-04-07T05:25:00.000Z	bright_fame	ATi7500	i am not such an expert on this file :D can give only basic advice
2007-04-07T05:26:00.000Z	ATi7500	bright_fame	 i found this link
2007-04-07T05:29:00.000Z	bright_fame	ATi7500	yep, worth a try, but retain a backup of old file just incase
2007-04-07T05:33:00.000Z	ATi7500	bright_fame	nothing...i was wondering..if i update to feisty?
2007-04-07T05:34:00.000Z	bright_fame	ATi7500	if you are less confident solving problems with ubuntu by yourself, better to wait until feisty is out of beta i would think
2007-04-07T05:34:00.000Z	ATi7500	bright_fame	ok, thank you
