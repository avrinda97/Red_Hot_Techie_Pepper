2006-12-06T11:36:00.000Z	Ralith	francis	install Firestarter
2006-12-06T11:36:00.000Z	francis	Ralith	how to install firestarter
2006-12-06T11:37:00.000Z	Ralith	francis	same way you install anything else
2006-12-06T11:37:00.000Z	Ralith	francis	there's not much need for a firewall in ubuntu, though
2006-12-06T11:39:00.000Z	francis	Ralith	is there a posbility that a yahoo chat booter can still boot me out?
2006-12-06T11:39:00.000Z	Ralith	francis	...what does yahoo chat have to do with anything?
2006-12-06T11:40:00.000Z	francis	Ralith	i just wonder if im still vulnerable using gaim in ubuntu box
2006-12-06T11:41:00.000Z	francis	Ralith	to boot attacks in yahoo rooms...coz i experience that a few times and i got frezzed and need to restart
2006-12-06T11:41:00.000Z	Ralith	francis	and a boot attack is...?
2006-12-06T11:41:00.000Z	francis	Ralith	boot attack is like flooding in IRC..
2006-12-06T11:42:00.000Z	francis	Ralith	they can even hack your account using windows..thats why im asking if using game makes me invincible
2006-12-06T11:43:00.000Z	francis	Ralith	gaim* i mean
2006-12-06T11:43:00.000Z	Ralith	francis	you're probably still vulnerable to flooding, but the only way to protect against that anywhere is by auto-ignoring anything that spams too fast
2006-12-06T11:44:00.000Z	francis	Ralith	is ther a way to configure that in gaim?
2006-12-06T11:44:00.000Z	Ralith	francis	if it does it, it will already do it. However, most IM protocols don't allow such spamming. I'd advise you use something sane like aim or gtalk
2006-12-06T11:45:00.000Z	francis	Ralith	ok thnks for the time..nice chatting with u
2006-12-06T11:47:00.000Z	francis	Ralith	have u tried to install softwares in ubuntu..i want to try a third party p2p like frostwire..problem is dont know how to install it
