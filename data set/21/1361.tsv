2011-08-22T03:08:00.000Z	glebihan	KM0201	that won't work
2011-08-23T10:12:00.000Z	KM0201	glebihan	doesn't sound like it.. he said he only has 1 partition..
2011-08-23T10:13:00.000Z	glebihan	KM0201	just double-checking, as an empty home would suggest that it's on another partition
2011-08-23T10:14:00.000Z	KM0201	glebihan	well, he said in nautilus, he only saw one partition available.. so.. i'm assuming thats not the case...
2011-08-23T10:15:00.000Z	glebihan	KM0201	except if the partition is not recognized for some reason (corrupted fs for example, which could also explain the plymouth error he had at boot)
2011-08-23T10:15:00.000Z	KM0201	glebihan	or he encrypted it... :)
2011-08-23T10:15:00.000Z	glebihan	KM0201	that's a possibility too
2011-08-23T10:15:00.000Z	KM0201	glebihan	well, we're just gonna create a new user now.. ..lol
2011-08-23T10:16:00.000Z	glebihan	KM0201	ok
2011-08-23T10:25:00.000Z	glebihan	KM0201	gack by default it won't have sudo access
2011-08-23T10:25:00.000Z	glebihan	KM0201	you have to out it the admin group
2011-08-23T10:26:00.000Z	glebihan	KM0201	gack actually it's "usermod username -aG admin"
2011-08-23T10:43:00.000Z	KM0201	glebihan	whats the -aG switch do?
2011-08-23T10:45:00.000Z	KM0201	glebihan	i'm not saying it doesn't... i've just never used it... what does that -aG switch do?
2011-08-23T10:45:00.000Z	glebihan	KM0201	-aG adds the user to the specified group
2011-08-23T10:46:00.000Z	KM0201	glebihan	well, adduser username groupname   also does
2011-08-23T10:46:00.000Z	glebihan	KM0201	no adduser creates a new user
2011-08-23T10:46:00.000Z	KM0201	glebihan	i know that.
2011-08-23T10:47:00.000Z	glebihan	KM0201	ok sorry did not know that
2011-08-23T10:47:00.000Z	glebihan	KM0201	I guess both commands are the same then
2011-08-23T10:48:00.000Z	KM0201	glebihan	i think what we're both doing, works.. i've just never used the -aG switch
