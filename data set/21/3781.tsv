2008-11-14T10:19:00.000Z	DasE1	ed1	ibex intrepid = 8.10
2008-11-14T10:21:00.000Z	ed1	DasE1	any advice on how to proceed?
2008-11-14T10:21:00.000Z	ed1	DasE1	ok
2008-11-14T10:34:00.000Z	ed1	DasE1	hey i ran alsamixergui
2008-11-14T10:34:00.000Z	ed1	DasE1	what should i do from there?
2008-11-14T10:35:00.000Z	DasE1	ed1	does the soundcard appear in  the upper panel of alsa-gui ?
2008-11-14T10:35:00.000Z	ed1	DasE1	no
2008-11-14T10:35:00.000Z	ed1	DasE1	but the first line of your instructions didnt work.. didnt find ubuntu-modules for my kernel
2008-11-14T10:36:00.000Z	DasE1	ed1	alsamixergui starts up, but can't see your soundcard in the right upper corner ?
2008-11-14T10:36:00.000Z	ed1	DasE1	yep
2008-11-14T10:37:00.000Z	ed1	DasE1	it says pulseaudio for card and chip
2008-11-14T10:42:00.000Z	ed1	DasE1	i have set everything to alsa and tried other combinations. none of them are producing any sounds :S
2008-11-14T10:43:00.000Z	ed1	DasE1	yes i checked in alsa mixer
2008-11-14T10:45:00.000Z	ed1	DasE1	..sorry to bother you but have you got any ideas?
2008-11-14T10:49:00.000Z	DasE1	ed1	alsamixer -Dhw
2008-11-14T10:50:00.000Z	ed1	DasE1	i checked. none of them are muted
2008-11-14T10:50:00.000Z	ed1	DasE1	except digital output which i set to "off"
2008-11-14T10:54:00.000Z	ed1	DasE1	you think this problem is a lost cause or do you think there is still a way to fix it?
2008-11-14T11:13:00.000Z	DasE1	ed1	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/163560      , make sure its an audigy2 (maybe look into case)
