2011-04-10T01:25:00.000Z	Jon--		Any idea how I can turn multiple jpegs into one PDF?
2011-04-10T01:27:00.000Z	coz_	Jon--	 you can use inkscape,,, open one of the images in inkscape,, embedded,,, from inkscape open each ofthe others... copy paste into the origianl image,, arrange them    shift+ctrl+s  to saveas,,, at the bottom right  the pulldown menu choose  pdf  as the option and save
2011-06-15T08:41:00.000Z	coz_	Jon--	   open a terminal and tell me the number this command puts out     glxinfo -l |grep MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE
2011-06-15T08:41:00.000Z	Jon--	coz_	    GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE = 8192
2011-06-15T08:42:00.000Z	Jon--	coz_	Please realize that I am still using my laptop monitor at the moment, not the hDMI connected one.
2011-06-15T08:42:00.000Z	coz_	Jon--	 understood,, but  I have not done this so trying to get a complete picture to see if I can figure this out
2011-06-15T08:43:00.000Z	coz_	Jon--	 first that command I gave you with the  8192  is a hardware limitation,, that is a large number   but it also means that whichever monitor you use it cannot go above that number horizonatally or vertically
2011-06-15T08:44:00.000Z	coz_	Jon--	 rather it cannto go above that resolution in any direction
2011-06-15T08:44:00.000Z	coz_	Jon--	 In terminal    lspci | grep -i vga
2011-06-15T08:45:00.000Z	Jon--	coz_	jon@jonnixbox:~$ lspci | grep -i vga
2011-06-15T08:45:00.000Z	coz_	Jon--	 ok and did this card come with and hdmi dongle?
2011-06-15T08:46:00.000Z	coz_	Jon--	 ah
2011-06-15T08:46:00.000Z	Jon--	coz_	This may be of use for my problem. http://pastebin.com/hmHXVjeF
2011-06-15T08:47:00.000Z	coz_	Jon--	 my experience with at is very very limited ,, did you ask in the #radeon channel?
2011-06-15T08:47:00.000Z	coz_	Jon--	 ok this is beyond my knowledge experience,,, try the #radeon channel
2011-06-15T08:51:00.000Z	coz_	Jon--	 where you type here type  this    /join #radeon
2011-06-15T08:52:00.000Z	Jon--	coz_	I don't think this is a radeon specific problem, it has to do with X and xrandr, I'd rather not waste time.
2011-06-15T08:52:00.000Z	coz_	Jon--	 but they would have much more experience with configuring this with an ati card
2011-06-15T09:08:00.000Z	Jon--	coz_	I am not sure.
2011-06-15T09:09:00.000Z	Jon--	coz_	Should I attempt a reboot and check?
2011-06-15T09:09:00.000Z	coz_	Jon--	  well I would stick with celthunder  for this,, I was just  suggesting  a possible  bios setting
