2008-06-22T00:21:00.000Z	Drk_Guy		Hi
2008-06-22T00:21:00.000Z	Drk_Guy		Is there a good "gaming" VM for ubuntu?
2008-06-22T00:22:00.000Z	Drk_Guy		I mean, it won't work right if compiz doesn't work right because they use the same acceleration libraries
2008-06-22T00:23:00.000Z	Drk_Guy		Extrange
2008-06-22T00:23:00.000Z	apophis	Drk_Guy	ScummVM :)
2008-06-22T00:23:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	apophis	ScummVM?
2008-06-22T00:24:00.000Z	apophis	Drk_Guy	You asked for a nice gaming vm :)
2008-06-22T00:24:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	apophis	And, is it light?
2008-06-22T00:25:00.000Z	apophis	Drk_Guy	well it is that light that it works on my iPod and on my MyPal (PDA)
2008-06-22T00:25:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	apophis	NICE
2008-06-22T00:25:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	apophis	I was downloading QEmu
2008-06-22T00:26:00.000Z	apophis	Drk_Guy	2 games are for free on ScummVM: Flight of the Amazon Queen :: and Beneath a Steel Sky, both are in the repos
2008-06-22T00:27:00.000Z	apophis	Drk_Guy	 I missunderstood you completly, :)
2008-06-22T00:29:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	apophis	I need a *real* VM
2008-06-22T00:29:00.000Z	apophis	Drk_Guy	 ;) why dont do a multiboot?
2008-06-22T00:29:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	apophis	I won't get back to winbugs
2008-06-22T00:29:00.000Z	apophis	Drk_Guy	a VM wont help you there, neither QEmu nor another one... you need an OS there
2008-06-22T00:31:00.000Z	apophis	Drk_Guy	thats what I said, make a multiboot :P if you run windows in a VM or in multiboot environment doesnt make much of a difference, beside that the VM will be slower
2008-06-22T00:31:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	apophis	Right...
2008-06-22T00:31:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	apophis	Thanks anyways
2008-06-22T00:31:00.000Z	apophis	Drk_Guy	you're welcome
