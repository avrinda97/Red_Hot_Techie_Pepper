2012-07-15T10:49:00.000Z	Colonel_Panic		having a bit of trouble trying to create an HFS+ partition
2012-07-15T10:50:00.000Z	Colonel_Panic		mkfs.hfsplus -v "my Apple FS" /dev/sdf1
2012-07-15T10:50:00.000Z	Colonel_Panic		and I'm getting: bash: /sbin/mkfs.hfsplus: No such file or directory
2012-07-15T10:50:00.000Z	Colonel_Panic		the command: mkfs.hfsplus -v "my Apple FS" /dev/sdf1
2012-07-15T10:51:00.000Z	Colonel_Panic		sdf1 is a USB drive
2012-07-15T10:51:00.000Z	Colonel_Panic		yesy
2012-07-15T10:51:00.000Z	Colonel_Panic		yes
2012-07-15T10:52:00.000Z	Colonel_Panic		I've tried using Gparted also, but of course that doesn't work either
2012-07-15T10:53:00.000Z	Colonel_Panic		Maybe I'll just try burning a PartedMagic LiveCD and doing it fron there
2012-07-15T10:53:00.000Z	Colonel_Panic		anyone know if PartedMagic supports HFS+?
2012-07-15T10:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Colonel_Panic	isn't parted magic just gparted on a bootable CD?
2012-07-15T10:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Colonel_Panic	I'm on the parted magic page now :)
2012-07-15T10:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Colonel_Panic	you can get all that stuff in Ubuntu in the liveCD....
2012-07-15T11:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Colonel_Panic	if you don't have hfsprogs you won't get it
2012-07-15T11:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Colonel_Panic	you can install hfsprogs in the liveCD using the repos
2012-07-15T11:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Colonel_Panic	its a package, it contains the command mkfs.hfsplus
2012-07-15T11:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Colonel_Panic	not massively obvious?
2012-07-15T11:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Colonel_Panic	I just asked ubottu to search for me :)
2012-07-15T11:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Colonel_Panic	or you can do it yourself at packages.ubuntu.com
2012-07-15T11:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Colonel_Panic	she's a bot :)
2012-07-15T11:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Colonel_Panic	I'd check the license for that first
