2008-07-17T01:01:00.000Z	carbuntu		can someone please remind me how to set four desktops up instead of two?  or where to look for info?  appreciate.
2008-07-17T01:02:00.000Z	Slart	carbuntu	it's in one of the first settings pages.. general or something.. number of desktops, horisontal and vertical
2008-07-17T01:06:00.000Z	Slart	carbuntu	either that.. or sudo apt-get install ccsm
2008-07-17T01:07:00.000Z	Slart	carbuntu	I use ccsm
2008-07-17T01:10:00.000Z	Slart	carbuntu	ah, sorry.. compizconfig-settings-manager
2008-07-17T01:26:00.000Z	Slart	carbuntu	nope.. shouldn't have to restart or anything.. is compiz enabled?
2008-07-17T01:16:00.000Z	Slart	carbuntu	system, preferences, advanced desktop effects settings
2008-07-17T01:18:00.000Z	Slart	carbuntu	in the first section.. general options.. desktop size
2008-07-17T01:18:00.000Z	Slart	carbuntu	you've got horisontal size and vertical size..
2008-07-17T01:20:00.000Z	Slart	carbuntu	hmm.. nah.. for a first timer you probably want to enable everything.. spin the cube, paint with fire, windows exploding left and right.. but after a week or so you'll probably go back to a more limited set of features.. I've got almost everything disabled.. except for some useful stuff =)
2008-07-17T01:20:00.000Z	Slart	carbuntu	yes.. you'll want 4 horisontal cubes for the cube.. correct
2008-07-17T01:20:00.000Z	Slart	carbuntu	3d?
2008-07-17T01:28:00.000Z	Slart	carbuntu	system, preferences, appearance.. one of the last tabs.. visual effects
2008-07-17T01:32:00.000Z	Slart	carbuntu	ah.. you'll need 3d acceleration to run compiz..
2008-07-17T01:33:00.000Z	Slart	carbuntu	have you tried using envyng to install the nvidia drivers?
2008-07-17T01:36:00.000Z	Slart	carbuntu	there is one that's put there by default.. "Volume control"
2008-07-17T01:37:00.000Z	Slart	carbuntu	right-click the panel, select "+Add to panel".. find volume control
2008-07-17T01:40:00.000Z	Slart	carbuntu	right click that volume control thingy and open the volume control dialog window
2008-07-17T01:41:00.000Z	Slart	carbuntu	there are lots of things to change there
2008-07-17T01:42:00.000Z	Slart	carbuntu	no worries.. =)
2008-07-17T01:44:00.000Z	Slart	carbuntu	check the preferences.. there could be more settings to enable.. also make sure you're using the speaker output, not line out or something like that
