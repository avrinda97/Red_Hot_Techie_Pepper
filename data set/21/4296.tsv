2008-10-30T08:34:00.000Z	woli		what is the maximum/average transfer rate between 2 computers conected through an ethernet cable?
2008-10-30T08:35:00.000Z	rww	woli	depends on the specifications of the network cards
2009-01-06T13:29:00.000Z	rww	woli	not much. If you need to write to it, make sure to use NTFS-3g. Oh, and if you don't shut down Windows properly, you won't be able to access the drive on Linux without doing some magic. That's about it.
2009-01-07T08:42:00.000Z	rww	woli	what CPU/processor does it have?
2009-01-07T08:43:00.000Z	woli	rww	is Core 2 Duo enough?
2009-01-07T08:43:00.000Z	rww	woli	Yeah. All Intel Core 2 processors can run either 32-bit or 64-bit; your choice.
2009-01-07T08:43:00.000Z	woli	rww	which do you recommend me?
2009-01-07T08:44:00.000Z	rww	woli	1) How much memory/RAM does the computer have? 2) Do you use it for specialized stuff like scientific computation, high-end video editing, etc?
2009-01-07T08:45:00.000Z	woli	rww	it has 4gb ram, and the toughest things I use are 3D games.
2009-01-07T08:45:00.000Z	woli	rww	is 64-bit faster?
2009-01-07T08:46:00.000Z	rww	woli	You probably won't notice much difference. The only thing is that most 32-bit Operating Systems (including Ubuntu by default) can't address more than 3.something GB of memory.
2009-01-07T08:46:00.000Z	woli	rww	how much ram can 64bit systems address?
2009-01-07T08:47:00.000Z	rww	woli	way, way more than you'll ever have.
2009-01-07T08:47:00.000Z	woli	rww	lol.. that sounds pretty evil
2009-01-07T08:47:00.000Z	rww	woli	it's several thousand GB, I think
2009-01-07T08:48:00.000Z	rww	woli	Flash, Java, Wine, and everything else work fine for me on 64-bit Ubuntu. Some people have problems with them though.
2009-01-07T08:49:00.000Z	woli	rww	which is your processor?
2009-01-07T08:49:00.000Z	rww	woli	Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600
2009-01-07T08:49:00.000Z	woli	rww	that sounds like some sort of satanic apocalyptic thing
2009-01-07T08:49:00.000Z	woli	rww	how many ghz?
2009-01-07T08:50:00.000Z	rww	woli	2.4Hz per core
