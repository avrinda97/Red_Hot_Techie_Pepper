2009-03-18T13:16:00.000Z	soreau	sky_	What happens when you plug the scanner to your PC?
2009-03-18T13:22:00.000Z	soreau	sky_	I didn't do much but you're welcome
2009-03-18T13:31:00.000Z	soreau	sky_	Use xsane or iscan
2009-03-18T13:36:00.000Z	sky_	soreau	nice xsane works perfectly for me !
2009-03-18T13:36:00.000Z	soreau	sky_	Awesome
2009-03-18T13:37:00.000Z	sky_	soreau	its very nice
2009-03-18T13:38:00.000Z	sky_	soreau	on windows i had a bigger problems with drivers for Vista...and now on linux is very easy and very nice :))
2009-03-18T13:38:00.000Z	soreau	sky_	Glad to hear you have it working now
2009-03-18T13:40:00.000Z	sky_	soreau	mmm but i scanned it ..but i cant open it..because it say that i dont have permissions
2009-03-18T13:40:00.000Z	soreau	sky_	Open what?
2009-03-18T13:40:00.000Z	sky_	soreau	scanned pictures
2009-03-18T13:40:00.000Z	soreau	sky_	You didn't run xsane as root or with sudo, did you?
2009-03-18T13:41:00.000Z	sky_	soreau	i run it as root
2009-03-18T13:41:00.000Z	soreau	sky_	Don't do that :/
2009-03-18T13:41:00.000Z	soreau	sky_	Now you have to change the permissions of your picture folder back to user
2009-03-18T13:41:00.000Z	sky_	soreau	yes it say me that is very dangerous but...hmm
2009-03-18T13:44:00.000Z	sky_	soreau	i tought that if i not run xsane as root i will cannot scan
2009-03-18T13:45:00.000Z	soreau	sky_	Well now that you've already run it as root, you might not be able to run it as user because of permission problems. But you should always assume you can do anything as user unless you know exactly why you must be root to do it
2009-03-18T13:46:00.000Z	sky_	soreau	i scan it again as user :D
