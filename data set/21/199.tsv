2012-06-08T22:40:00.000Z	alinef		Hello! Anyone here EVER packaged an application for Ubuntu?
2012-06-08T22:41:00.000Z	sacarlson	alinef	I've read about it and posibly tried it 1 or 2 times some time ago
2012-06-08T22:42:00.000Z	alinef	sacarlson	thanks! I want to help package the emesene version to update the ppa for ubuntu users, but I have no idea of HOW to do it.
2012-06-08T22:47:00.000Z	sacarlson	alinef	I just read what I forgot as I think I was doing it the simple way with checkinstall but if it's distributed it's a bit more complicated
2012-06-08T22:48:00.000Z	sacarlson	alinef	to start read https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PackagingGuide/Complete
2012-06-08T22:49:00.000Z	alinef	sacarlson	ok then
2012-06-08T22:49:00.000Z	alinef		I'll read it
2012-06-08T22:50:00.000Z	alinef		I know, trism
2012-06-08T22:51:00.000Z	alinef		But the version there is ooold, and the recent one came with a lot of fix ups and good changes
2012-06-08T22:51:00.000Z	sacarlson	alinef	if it exists why is it your makeing another one?  you branching a new version?
2012-06-08T22:51:00.000Z	alinef		That's why I want to help them out to package it to all other ubuntu users who like emesene
2012-06-08T22:52:00.000Z	alinef		The latest one is 2.12.5
2012-06-08T22:52:00.000Z	alinef		And it was released 3 days ago
2012-06-08T22:54:00.000Z	sacarlson	alinef	it shows that emesene was updated 1 hour ago, that recent and they compiled an old version?
2012-06-08T22:55:00.000Z	alinef	sacarlson	I saw it
2012-06-08T22:55:00.000Z	alinef		I guess someone who know how, did it before I could!
2012-06-08T22:55:00.000Z	alinef	sacarlson	trism that's what I was trying to do. Update the ppa version! :D
2012-06-08T22:56:00.000Z	sacarlson	alinef	that's ok there are many more things to be updated for you to continue to work on, don't stop
2012-06-08T22:58:00.000Z	alinef		I'll try to learn how to do it, so next time I can do it myself :D
2012-06-08T22:58:00.000Z	sacarlson	alinef	ya like my multicoin needs to be packaged it's just source now I never created a deb for it https://github.com/sacarlson/MultiCoin
2012-06-08T23:01:00.000Z	alinef	sacarlson	what's your project about? :)
