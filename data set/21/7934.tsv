2006-07-01T10:20:00.000Z	efox		i am trying to use CRON to make a frequent backups. I want my backups to be kept in /root. So i became root and modified the crontab yet its not doing the backup
2006-07-01T10:21:00.000Z	efox		my entry is as follows: * * * * * /root/backups/blah.tar /home/me/folder/
2006-07-01T10:21:00.000Z	martin__	efox	how often do you want the backup to run?
2006-07-01T10:22:00.000Z	efox	martin__	 im just playing around with it now, but the end result would be either twice a day or once a day...but for now, every minute
2006-07-01T10:22:00.000Z	martin__	efox	every minute would be */1 * * * *  I believe
2006-07-01T10:23:00.000Z	efox	martin__	i know this works every minute because as a user it works. but as root i want it to store the files in the /root directory.
2006-07-01T10:24:00.000Z	efox	martin__	is the syntax correct  though ? i think thats where my problem may lie
2006-07-01T10:24:00.000Z	martin__	efox	sorry, I wasn't paying attention
2006-07-01T10:24:00.000Z	efox	martin__	lol ok.
2006-07-01T10:26:00.000Z	martin__	efox	as far as I'm aware, you only run a single command in the cron
2006-07-01T10:26:00.000Z	martin__	efox	so you would have a script to actually do the job
2006-07-01T10:26:00.000Z	efox	martin__	so get cron to run the script every so often ?
2006-07-01T10:27:00.000Z	martin__	efox	yes, that's right
2006-07-01T10:28:00.000Z	efox	martin__	i can try that. thanks...but...why would it work as a user and not as root ?
2006-07-01T10:29:00.000Z	martin__	efox	sorry- I'm lost. what is working as a user?
2006-07-01T10:33:00.000Z	efox	martin__	 my username is efox. as efox, i added to my cron    * * * * * ~/backups/blah.tar /documents
2006-07-01T10:34:00.000Z	efox	martin__	 this made a tar of documents in my backups folder
2006-07-01T10:34:00.000Z	efox	martin__	however, if i am root and do the SAME thing, except im keeping the tar in the /root directory, it does not work
2006-07-01T10:34:00.000Z	efox	martin__	thats what i meant by it
2006-07-01T10:36:00.000Z	martin__	efox	sorry, I have no idea then...
2006-07-01T10:36:00.000Z	efox	martin__	no worries
