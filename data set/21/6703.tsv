2007-02-19T11:45:00.000Z	rmd_	rylan	it means you didnt follow the instructions for wine installation correctly
2007-02-19T11:46:00.000Z	rmd_	rylan	start over from the beginning
2007-02-19T11:46:00.000Z	rylan	rmd_	i did follow the instructions though
2007-02-19T11:54:00.000Z	rylan	rmd_	hmm, went through it all again copy and past and same problem
2007-02-19T11:54:00.000Z	rylan	rmd_	my computer is the devil though.
2007-02-19T11:55:00.000Z	rmd_	rylan	the GPG problem?
2007-02-19T11:55:00.000Z	rylan	rmd_	yeah, that one
2007-02-19T11:56:00.000Z	rylan	rmd_	just curious, can wine install windowns programs from cd or only from download?
2007-02-19T11:56:00.000Z	rmd_	rylan	if you ever get it working, programs that work with wine can be installed from a cd
2007-02-19T11:56:00.000Z	rylan	rmd_	 anyone know if Oblivion will work?
2007-02-19T11:56:00.000Z	rmd_	rylan	as for your installation problem, all i know is you're probably having a gpg problem and i don't know where to begin diagnosing it.
2007-02-19T11:57:00.000Z	rylan	rmd_	 thanks anyways.
2007-02-19T11:57:00.000Z	rmd_	rylan	http://appdb.winehq.org/search.php?sSearchQuery=oblivion
2007-02-19T11:59:00.000Z	rylan	rmd_	 so that is to say, not bloody likely it will work nice.
2007-02-19T11:59:00.000Z	rmd_	rylan	i feel your pain.  i've spent a good deal of time figuring out wine only to find out that MS Streets & Trips works like total crap.. if it ever boots
