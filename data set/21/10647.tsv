2005-01-08T10:17:00.000Z	ColeT		Hi all - anybody willing to help an ubuntu newbie with a window manager problem?
2005-01-08T10:18:00.000Z	ColeT		Here's the deal.  I want to use sawfish instead of metacity.  I went into the gconf tool and changed the window manager setting, but it keeps getting reverted back to metacity when I log in.  I do have sawfish installed...
2005-01-08T10:18:00.000Z	ColeT		Any thoughts?
2005-01-08T10:19:00.000Z	ogra	ColeT	make sure you save your session on logout if using sawfish
2005-01-08T10:20:00.000Z	ColeT	ogra	I can't get sawfish to fire up in the first place...
2005-01-08T10:20:00.000Z	ogra	ColeT	in a terminal: killall metacity && sleep 2 && sawfish &
2005-01-08T10:21:00.000Z	ogra	ColeT	if sawfish runs and the gconf key is set, save your session on logout
2005-01-08T10:21:00.000Z	ColeT	ogra	Let me give that a shot.
2005-01-08T10:21:00.000Z	ogra	ColeT	on logout
2005-01-08T10:23:00.000Z	ColeT	ogra	Looks like metacity is getting respawned automagically when I try to kill it.  8)
2005-01-08T10:24:00.000Z	ogra	ColeT	then drop the sleep command in the line i gave you
2005-01-08T10:25:00.000Z	ogra	ColeT	dont forget to check the checkbox ;)
2005-01-08T10:26:00.000Z	ColeT	ogra	That seems to have done it.  Thanks for the suggestions.
2005-01-08T12:50:00.000Z	ogra	ColeT	once sawfish had a config tool
2005-01-08T12:50:00.000Z	ColeT	ogra	sawfish-ui?
2005-01-08T12:51:00.000Z	ogra	ColeT	cant you switch it off with that ?
2005-01-08T12:51:00.000Z	ColeT	ogra	I didn't see an option in there ... I'll look again though.
2005-01-08T12:55:00.000Z	ColeT	ogra	The sawfish-ui thing doesn't seem to have an option to turn the pager off.  Any other thoughts?  8)
2005-01-08T12:56:00.000Z	ogra	ColeT	dunno, i could only point you to google, last time i used sawfish was gnome 1.x
2005-01-08T12:56:00.000Z	ColeT	ogra	*grin*  Thanks for the help anyway.  Do you use gnome?  If so, are you using metacity?
2005-01-08T12:57:00.000Z	ogra	ColeT	sure, i use ubuntu default (with calendar ;) )
