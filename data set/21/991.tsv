2011-03-14T17:52:00.000Z	ThinkT510	jwtiyar	i saw your post and am thinking
2011-03-14T17:52:00.000Z	jwtiyar	ThinkT510	sorry
2011-03-14T17:53:00.000Z	ThinkT510	jwtiyar	so it boots the usb stick, maybe the grub info is setup wrong
2011-03-14T17:54:00.000Z	jwtiyar	ThinkT510	its stopped in that line that has (-)
2011-03-14T17:55:00.000Z	ThinkT510	jwtiyar	can you select any entries in the grub menu?
2011-03-14T17:56:00.000Z	jwtiyar	ThinkT510	its black windows just the symbol - turn on and off
2011-03-14T17:57:00.000Z	ThinkT510	jwtiyar	hmm, so it doesn't even show grub?
2011-03-14T17:57:00.000Z	jwtiyar	ThinkT510	iits seems no
2011-03-14T17:57:00.000Z	ThinkT510	jwtiyar	what did you use to install ubuntu to the stick?
2011-03-14T17:58:00.000Z	jwtiyar	ThinkT510	usb maker on my other ubuntu 10.10
2011-03-14T17:58:00.000Z	ThinkT510	jwtiyar	has it worked before on that stick?
2011-03-14T17:58:00.000Z	jwtiyar	ThinkT510	sorry also in 10.4.1. LTS
2011-03-14T17:59:00.000Z	jwtiyar	ThinkT510	i didnt used usb sdcard but its worked with my other usb like my apple and sony
2011-03-14T18:00:00.000Z	ThinkT510	jwtiyar	ah, so its a usb sdcard reader?
2011-03-14T18:00:00.000Z	jwtiyar	ThinkT510	yes via card reader
2011-03-14T18:01:00.000Z	ThinkT510	jwtiyar	i'm not sure if they work the same as an ordinary usb stick install
2011-03-14T18:04:00.000Z	ThinkT510	jwtiyar	after a little googleing it seems that it should work just like a usb install
2011-03-14T18:04:00.000Z	jwtiyar	ThinkT510	i dont understand ..
2011-03-14T18:05:00.000Z	ThinkT510	jwtiyar	sorry i can't help more, never tried booting from sd cards
