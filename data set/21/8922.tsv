2008-07-27T11:52:00.000Z	simi		hi, i compiled my own kernel(build my drivers and other required module into kernel), i tried 3 difrent .configure (in some i do not disable any modules) Problem is that i do not have sound or network driver
2008-07-27T11:53:00.000Z	simi		i need help to diagnostic my problem
2008-07-27T11:54:00.000Z	simi		anyone compiled  a custom kernel here?

2008-07-27T11:56:00.000Z	cwillu	simi	did you do make oldconfig?
2008-07-27T11:58:00.000Z	simi	cwillu	yes, i do that one time, other time configured manualy the .config because the menu config  saved a file with fewer lines
2008-07-27T11:59:00.000Z	cwillu	simi	which kernel are you compiling?  (and as long as I'm asking, why are you compiling a kernel?)
2008-07-27T11:59:00.000Z	simi	cwillu	can you tell me what logs should i look in , what coomands to do to find out what could be the problem
2008-07-27T11:59:00.000Z	simi	cwillu	the 2.6.24 from hard repos
2008-07-27T12:01:00.000Z	simi	cwillu	i compile a kernel to build my driver in to increase the performance
2008-07-27T12:02:00.000Z	cwillu	simi	where did you get the idea that compiling your own kernel would increase performance?
2008-07-27T12:02:00.000Z	cwillu	simi	i.e., are you adding any patches?
2008-07-27T12:03:00.000Z	simi	cwillu	i do not add patches just my drivers like scsi acpi  VFAT, FUSE i build them into the kernel,
2008-07-27T12:03:00.000Z	simi	cwillu	maybe i should seitch to gentoo
2008-07-27T12:03:00.000Z	cwillu	simi	there's no practical difference between the performance of using modules vs the performance of compiling them straight in,
2008-07-27T12:04:00.000Z	cwillu	simi	except that when you compile them in, you're forced to use that memory, which may be a waste in many many cases
2008-07-27T12:04:00.000Z	simi	cwillu	but at boot speed? that modules are loaded at boot speed, and it must be some slight performance if i optimize the kernel for my intel pentium cpu
2008-07-27T12:05:00.000Z	cwillu	simi	not really, no
2008-07-27T12:05:00.000Z	cwillu	simi	the generic kernel already has pentium optimizations in
2008-07-27T12:06:00.000Z	simi	cwillu	 from the .config of the generic kernel it is not optimized for pentium
2008-07-27T12:06:00.000Z	cwillu	simi	ubuntu's -generic kernel is, yes
