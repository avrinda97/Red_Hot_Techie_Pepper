2008-12-10T11:00:00.000Z	l7		any ubuntu mactel users here?
2008-12-10T11:00:00.000Z	rdw200169	l7	you mean ubuntu on a mac?
2008-12-10T11:01:00.000Z	l7	rdw200169	yeah
2008-12-10T11:01:00.000Z	rdw200169	l7	when i did it, i use rEFIt, and boot camp
2008-12-10T11:01:00.000Z	l7	rdw200169	why refit as a bootloader instead of lilo or grub?
2008-12-10T11:07:00.000Z	l7	rdw200169	how was your experience with ubuntu as far as dual booting osx and ubuntu vs running ubuntu in a VM?
2008-12-10T11:02:00.000Z	rdw200169	l7	i don't know about the new ones, they have NVIDIA, so they should work well... NVIDIA drivers are on point
2008-12-10T11:02:00.000Z	rdw200169	l7	you use both, but you have to trick the EFI (mac BIOS replacement) into loading the linux boot camp part, but still allow you to load mac
2008-12-10T11:02:00.000Z	l7	rdw200169	do the macs with ATI cards not work so well?
2008-12-10T11:03:00.000Z	rdw200169	l7	it's the ati drivers, they're worse than NVIDIA, but they still work
2008-12-10T11:04:00.000Z	l7	rdw200169	ah well that's good to know.  i suppose the intel drivers are probably the best aren't they?  in terms of being open source rather than nvidia's binary blobs?
2008-12-10T11:05:00.000Z	rdw200169	l7	there are also open source nvidia drivers, i just prefer the binaries b/c they have more features
2008-12-10T11:06:00.000Z	rdw200169	l7	i followed some excellent tutorials on installing ubuntu on a mac, they won't steer you wrong
2008-12-10T11:07:00.000Z	l7	rdw200169	yeah i'm a bit on the fence about whether to try ubuntu on a newer macbook
2008-12-10T11:08:00.000Z	rdw200169	l7	using rEFIt, it's been a piece of cake
2008-12-10T11:08:00.000Z	rdw200169	l7	refit gives me a boot menu, giving me the options of mac or ubuntu, right when i turn it on
2008-12-10T11:10:00.000Z	l7	rdw200169	yeah, i'm not sure i like splitting my environment with a dual boot though
2008-12-10T11:10:00.000Z	l7	rdw200169	how much did you use ubuntu vs osx or windows?
2008-12-10T11:10:00.000Z	rdw200169	l7	well, i use ubuntu exclusively, but i've been using it for many yeras
2008-12-10T11:11:00.000Z	rdw200169	l7	i just wish i could use the Omni products in linux...
2008-12-10T11:11:00.000Z	rdw200169	l7	omnigraffle is the greatest thing on earth, but that's off topic
