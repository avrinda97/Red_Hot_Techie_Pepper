2008-04-15T00:55:00.000Z	daire		:O
2008-04-15T00:55:00.000Z	Slart	daire	adobe if you want it to work =)
2008-04-15T00:56:00.000Z	Slart	daire	gnash is a great initiative.. I wish them all well.. but it's got a bit to go
2008-04-15T01:00:00.000Z	Slart	daire	define "long time".. minutes? hours? days?
2008-04-15T01:01:00.000Z	Slart	daire	it might download something from adobe's site.. that could be what's taking time
2008-04-15T01:03:00.000Z	Slart	daire	well.. you might have better luck tomorrow
2008-04-15T01:03:00.000Z	daire	Slart	is this because adobe don't really give a shit about linux users?
2008-04-15T01:04:00.000Z	Slart	daire	I try not to judge to quickly.. but there might be some truth in what you say
2008-04-15T01:07:00.000Z	daire	Slart	is there a way to kill the applying changes synaptics window? i've tried just closing it and firefox already prompted me to force quit
2008-04-15T01:08:00.000Z	Slart	daire	hmm.. run xkill in a terminal and click on the window you want to kill
2008-04-15T01:10:00.000Z	daire	Slart	when i try to get gnash swf player now it tells me This usually means that another package management application (like apt-get or aptitude) already running. Please close that application first.
2008-04-15T01:11:00.000Z	Slart	daire	hmm.. I'd just try logging off and on again... or rebooting.. you could kill the processes.. but it might be easier to just restart
2008-04-15T01:18:00.000Z	daire	Slart	now i get the error E: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem.  and it tells me to report it, my firefox windows are all frozen again
2008-04-15T01:19:00.000Z	Slart	daire	then do that.. "sudo dpkg --configure -a"
2008-04-15T01:19:00.000Z	Slart	daire	 =)
2008-04-15T01:20:00.000Z	daire	Slart	it's asking me for the sude password for my account, but i haven't set a sudo one and it won't take my regular password
2008-04-15T01:20:00.000Z	Slart	daire	check caps lock and typos
2008-04-15T01:21:00.000Z	Slart	daire	sudo password is your user password.. the same one you use to log in
2008-04-15T01:23:00.000Z	Slart	daire	yay.. success =)
2008-04-15T20:20:00.000Z	Slart	daire	I've never been able to use those features in firefox either..
