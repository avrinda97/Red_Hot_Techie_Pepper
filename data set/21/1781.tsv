2011-05-01T10:17:00.000Z	PythonPup	tyr	ask your question.  If someone can help, they will.  Don't ask to ask a question.
2011-05-01T10:18:00.000Z	tyr	PythonPup	I cannot understand the instructions here http://sampbar.com/2009/04/broadcom-bcm4318-ubuntu-intrepid/
2011-05-01T10:21:00.000Z	PythonPup	tyr	maybe  could answer a specific question, if you have one.  I never use ndiswrapper.  I think it is a bad idea.  I'd go get a better wireless card, that is really supported in Linux.
2011-05-01T10:23:00.000Z	PythonPup	tyr	click on the icon in the top left and type a few characters of the command you want
2011-05-01T10:38:00.000Z	tyr	PythonPup	how do I copy files to my home directory?
2011-05-01T10:39:00.000Z	PythonPup	tyr	how are you trying to copy?
2011-05-01T10:40:00.000Z	tyr	PythonPup	how do I copy to home?
2011-05-01T10:41:00.000Z	PythonPup	tyr	for example, to copy a file from Downloads called  thisfile, do   cd ~   then cp Download/thisfile .
2011-05-01T10:45:00.000Z	tyr	PythonPup	are you sure you gave the right syntax for copying?
2011-05-01T10:46:00.000Z	tyr	PythonPup	it gave the message: cp: missing destination file operand after `Download/broadcom-wl-4.150.10.5.tar.bz2'
2011-05-01T10:47:00.000Z	PythonPup	tyr	sure.  But your file may have a different name.  Do a man cp to get the syntax.  It is just cp source destination    at its basics.
2011-05-01T10:47:00.000Z	PythonPup	tyr	you must have left of the . at the end.  . indicates the current directory.
2011-05-01T10:51:00.000Z	tyr	PythonPup	I right clicked the files and asked to copy to home directory. but they were instead copied to home/username.
2011-05-01T10:52:00.000Z	tyr	PythonPup	is there any other way to  copy these files? I am a new user and I can't understand your commands
2011-05-01T10:53:00.000Z	tyr	PythonPup	In linux mint i think there was a way to open the home folder as the admin and then copy
2011-05-01T10:53:00.000Z	PythonPup	tyr	Most people would call home/username their home directory.  You may not have permissions to copy to /home.  If you really mean /home, then do the cp as sudo.
2011-05-01T10:54:00.000Z	PythonPup	tyr	probably.  Their are lots of ways to do it.  You can open a nautilus root shell, or use sudo , or open a root terminal shel;l and copy.
2011-05-01T11:00:00.000Z	tyr	PythonPup	nothing has happened after following the instructions in the page. Let me restart and confirm
