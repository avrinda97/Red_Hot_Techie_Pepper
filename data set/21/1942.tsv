2010-04-09T07:18:00.000Z	ToStItOs		I installed Ubuntu 9.10 in my secondary slave drive with the Windows Xp drive plugged in. One problem is Windows is not loading. I have read you can restore Windows to the bootloader. Would it be a wise decision?
2010-04-09T07:18:00.000Z	randomusr_	ToStItOs	how did you configure grub upon install?
2010-04-09T07:20:00.000Z	ToStItOs	randomusr_	I apparently did not configure it correctly you see I am not very familiar with partitioning so I screwed that up
2010-04-09T07:22:00.000Z	randomusr_	ToStItOs	no need to be brash, just trying to help. Why not try re-installing grub?
2010-04-09T07:24:00.000Z	randomusr_	ToStItOs	do you not want assistance then?
2010-04-09T07:24:00.000Z	ToStItOs	randomusr_	I do
2010-04-09T07:25:00.000Z	randomusr_	ToStItOs	being upset does nothing to fix the problem
2010-04-09T07:27:00.000Z	randomusr_	ToStItOs	the best way to get help is ask what you want to accomplish
2010-04-09T07:28:00.000Z	ToStItOs	randomusr_	I know I had a thought now you said reinstall grub
2010-04-09T07:30:00.000Z	randomusr_	ToStItOs	pull up a terminal please
2010-04-09T07:30:00.000Z	randomusr_	ToStItOs	that's bold and cumbersome, but i guess it could work. it helps to know what you're doing
2010-04-09T07:32:00.000Z	randomusr_	ToStItOs	I don't understand, what does that have to do with anything?
2010-04-09T07:39:00.000Z	ToStItOs	randomusr_	Let me explain the issue more clearly:  I have two computers one has Xubuntu alone the other has Windows Xp and I added a second drive which now contains 9.10. What happened is I believe I did not configure the bootloader towards the end of install but again this is my first time adding a second drive with Windows Xp
2010-04-09T07:39:00.000Z	randomusr_	ToStItOs	hold a moment
2010-04-09T07:40:00.000Z	randomusr_	ToStItOs	open a terminal
2010-04-09T07:43:00.000Z	randomusr_	ToStItOs	do this from the command line "gksudo gedit /boot/grub/grub.cfg"
2010-04-09T07:43:00.000Z	randomusr_	ToStItOs	tell me if windows is listed
2010-04-09T07:44:00.000Z	ToStItOs	randomusr_	I configured that last night windows is in there but for some reason when I select windows i get a black blank screen
2010-04-09T07:45:00.000Z	randomusr_	ToStItOs	could you copy the lines for windows and pastebin it?
2010-04-09T07:45:00.000Z	randomusr_	ToStItOs	then give me the link to the pastebin?
2010-04-09T07:47:00.000Z	randomusr_	ToStItOs	ubottu, lists the official page for grub above
