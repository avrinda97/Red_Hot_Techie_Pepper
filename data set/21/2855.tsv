2009-06-01T05:27:00.000Z	deeb0		oops
2009-06-01T05:28:00.000Z	deeb0		i meant to say ploooop
2009-06-01T05:30:00.000Z	deeb0		ploooop: Well I just went to the link posted by the bot and I tried the pysdm package... the thing is my ubuntu is installed in the same partition as my windows
2009-06-01T05:30:00.000Z	deeb0		ploooop:  I didn't do full installation.... I did "Install in Windows" option
2009-06-01T05:30:00.000Z	Kalmi	deeb0	oh... that's the problem...
2009-06-01T05:31:00.000Z	deeb0		I figured
2009-06-01T05:31:00.000Z	deeb0	Kalmi	So it's not possible huh?
2009-06-01T05:32:00.000Z	Kalmi	deeb0	i don't think it is... you could force it, but that is probably very unsafe...
2009-06-01T05:32:00.000Z	deeb0	Kalmi	unsafe as in?
2009-06-01T05:33:00.000Z	Kalmi	deeb0	might damage your windows file system
2009-06-01T05:33:00.000Z	deeb0		grrr
2009-06-01T05:33:00.000Z	Kalmi		:)
2009-06-01T05:33:00.000Z	deeb0		Why me?
2009-06-01T05:33:00.000Z	deeb0		lol
2009-06-01T05:33:00.000Z	deeb0		Have you guys seen it happen often?
2009-06-01T05:33:00.000Z	Kalmi	deeb0	a real install (not wubi) can safely read/write files on a windows partition
2009-06-01T05:34:00.000Z	deeb0		blah... so I guess I have to uninstall and then make a dual boot of full ubuntu huh
2009-06-01T05:35:00.000Z	deeb0		Ok well thanks for the help everyone, I guess I gotta reinstall Ubuntu
2009-06-01T05:35:00.000Z	deeb0		Take it easy all.
2009-06-01T05:36:00.000Z	Kalmi	deeb0	yep
