2009-05-19T03:01:00.000Z	AE_		so, how do I go about diagnosing my audio problem (no sound:/), nothing is muted in alsamixer (lspci output here: http://pastebin.ca/1426893 )
2009-05-19T03:02:00.000Z	dotblank	AE_	some commands are aplay -l and aplay -L and a nice script in #alsa
2009-05-19T03:04:00.000Z	AE_	dotblank	http://pastebin.ca/1426897
2009-05-19T03:05:00.000Z	dotblank	AE_	that output looks normal.. what happens when you run speaker-test -c 2 -t wav
2009-05-19T03:07:00.000Z	AE_	dotblank	http://pastebin.ca/1426899 but no sound coming out of speakers
2009-05-19T03:07:00.000Z	dotblank	AE_	how are your speakers configured?
2009-05-19T03:08:00.000Z	AE_		hm, it's a laptop
2009-05-19T03:08:00.000Z	dotblank	AE_	oh... hmm does your laptop have a hardware audio switch?
2009-05-19T03:09:00.000Z	AE_	dotblank	no idea, where is that usually located?
2009-05-19T03:09:00.000Z	dotblank	AE_	usually they dont exist.... wel anyway can you run alsamixer and make sure stuff isnt muted (like PCM and master)
2009-05-19T03:10:00.000Z	dotblank	AE_	sometimes if you have headphones plugged in that will also mute there also might be an option in alsamixer for headphone
2009-05-19T03:11:00.000Z	AE_	dotblank	Yep, nothing is muted in alsamixer. I cant find any audio switch so I guess there is none
2009-05-19T03:11:00.000Z	dotblank	AE_	run that speaker test constantly and play with alsa mixer untill you find somthing that works..
2009-05-19T03:11:00.000Z	dotblank	AE_	is anything like surround sound or shared audiop jacks or anything wierd..
2009-05-19T03:12:00.000Z	dotblank	AE_	and one last question is has the audio ever worked :)
2009-05-19T03:12:00.000Z	AE_		hm, I dont know, I just got this laptop from work dotblank
2009-05-19T03:13:00.000Z	dotblank	AE_	maybe the audio is disabled in the bios
2009-05-19T03:13:00.000Z	dotblank	AE_	also try headphoens
2009-05-19T03:13:00.000Z	AE_		I'll check bios
2009-05-19T03:13:00.000Z	AE_		Tried headphones, dont work either
2009-05-19T03:14:00.000Z	dotblank	AE_	if all else fails you can either try 1. a differant OS, 2. manually adding updated alsa drivers, 3. or get a new laptop (might actually be broken)
