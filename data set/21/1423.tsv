2010-10-20T22:56:00.000Z	nothingspecial	ksk_	How are you trying to install it
2010-10-20T22:56:00.000Z	nothingspecial	ksk_	And does it say it will install those too?
2010-10-20T22:58:00.000Z	nothingspecial	ksk_	What is the error message concerning those packages. Do you need them or is it saying it will install them
2010-10-20T23:00:00.000Z	nothingspecial	ksk_	Why will software center not let You install?
2010-10-20T23:00:00.000Z	nothingspecial	ksk_	Missed a bit sorry. Are you updating or do you have synaptic open. You can only use one at a time
2010-10-20T23:01:00.000Z	nothingspecial	ksk_	apt aptitude software center, synaptic and update manager. They are all the same thing
2010-10-20T23:02:00.000Z	nothingspecial	ksk_	E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?
2010-10-20T23:02:00.000Z	nothingspecial	ksk_	That`s the clue, is another process using it?
2010-10-20T23:03:00.000Z	nothingspecial	ksk_	With apt?
2010-10-20T23:04:00.000Z	nothingspecial	ksk_	software center will not work until apt-get has finished
2010-10-20T23:11:00.000Z	nothingspecial	ksk_	What`s up?
