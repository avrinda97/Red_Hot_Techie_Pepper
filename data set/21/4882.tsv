2008-01-27T08:01:00.000Z	un_op	ubuntuo	you cant change permissions and ownership on an Ipod, it's formatted as FAT and FAT has no understanding of such
2008-01-27T08:01:00.000Z	un_op	ubuntuo	you'll just need to mount the ipod correctly
2008-01-27T08:02:00.000Z	un_op	ubuntuo	and you cannot really drag and drop files into the ipod_control folder, you need something like itunes or gtkpod to do that for you
2008-01-27T08:05:00.000Z	un_op	ubuntuo	yw
2008-01-27T08:07:00.000Z	un_op	ubuntuo	errm, i think you'll need a newer version of libgpod -- hold on
2008-01-27T08:09:00.000Z	ubuntuo	un_op	libgpod2 is installed
2008-01-27T08:10:00.000Z	un_op	ubuntuo	^^^
2008-01-27T08:10:00.000Z	un_op	ubuntuo	the post above was meant for you
2008-01-27T08:11:00.000Z	un_op	ubuntuo	once you add that line in, you'll need to update apt/synaptic, remove gtkpod, libgpod2 and install gtkpod again
