2011-12-16T19:22:00.000Z	Krenair		How do I go about install OpenJDK 7 on Ubuntu 11.04?
2011-12-16T19:22:00.000Z	Krenair		I'd like to replace Sun's JVM with it
2011-12-16T19:23:00.000Z	Krenair		I want to install OpenJDK 7, not upgrade my OS

2011-12-16T19:24:00.000Z	Krenair	schnuffle	danke
2011-12-16T19:24:00.000Z	schnuffle	Krenair	fine I hit a german :)
2011-12-16T19:26:00.000Z	schnuffle	Krenair	Here's a thread about OpenJDK: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1701131
2011-12-16T19:27:00.000Z	Krenair	schnuffle	hm, I can't add ppa:dlecan/openjdk :/
2011-12-16T19:27:00.000Z	schnuffle	Krenair	What version of ubuntu are you running LTS 10.04?
2011-12-16T19:35:00.000Z	schnuffle	Krenair	strange it works for me: sudo apt-add-repository ppa:openjdk/ppa
2011-12-16T19:37:00.000Z	schnuffle	Krenair	Could be due to amd64 platform, but I see it is supported. To delete it just go to /etc/apt/sources.list.d and delete the repo file
2011-12-16T19:40:00.000Z	schnuffle	Krenair	Yep
2011-12-16T19:43:00.000Z	schnuffle	Krenair	the package is called openjdk-7-jdk or openjdk-7-jre
2011-12-16T19:45:00.000Z	schnuffle	Krenair	I just added the repo to test it, searching for openjdk gave me both versions 6 and 7
2011-12-16T19:46:00.000Z	Krenair	schnuffle	it does look like openjdk didn't release anything for natty apart from icedtea-web
2011-12-16T19:48:00.000Z	schnuffle	Krenair	Aaah, I forgot that i'm on 11.10 which has the packages
2011-12-16T19:49:00.000Z	Krenair	schnuffle	so 11.04 users aren't allowed to install openjdk7 from the repos?
2011-12-16T19:52:00.000Z	schnuffle	Krenair	I seems like dlecan which did a backport to natty moved along to oneiric
2011-12-16T19:53:00.000Z	schnuffle	Krenair	It should be as it has been done already, but could be some work
2011-12-16T19:57:00.000Z	Krenair	schnuffle	I've added "deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/openjdk/ppa/ubuntu oneiric main" to the software sources, but apt-get update fails :/
2011-12-16T19:59:00.000Z	schnuffle	Krenair	I told him the answer already
