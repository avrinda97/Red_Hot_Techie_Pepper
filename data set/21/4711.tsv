2008-12-18T21:14:00.000Z	sisif		Hello guys. When trying to compile mplayer from cvn i got this error: collect2: "ld returned 1 exit status". I know LD is GNU Linker, but I have no ideea on how to fix this. Any sugestion will be apreciated. Thanks.
2008-12-18T21:16:00.000Z	hischild	sisif	always a good idea
2008-12-18T21:19:00.000Z	hischild	sisif	please pastebin the entire error, from top to bottom.
2008-12-18T21:20:00.000Z	sisif	hischild	: you want to paste ALL output from compileing process ?
2008-12-18T21:20:00.000Z	hischild	sisif	from the part you type make to the new terminal you get, yes.
2008-12-18T21:21:00.000Z	sisif	hischild	: I`ll have to "make" again since my terminal doen`t scroll that much up
2008-12-18T21:21:00.000Z	hischild	sisif	then just pastebin what you got now.
2008-12-18T21:21:00.000Z	sisif	hischild	: ok, just a second
2008-12-18T21:23:00.000Z	sisif	hischild	: there you go: http://pastebin.com/d6da6e162
2008-12-18T21:24:00.000Z	hischild	sisif	curious, but did you do this before hand? --> apt-get build-dep mplayer (assuming this is just mplayer you're building)
2008-12-18T21:27:00.000Z	sisif	hischild	: no, I didn`t
2008-12-18T21:30:00.000Z	sisif	hischild	: beside, apt-get build-dep mplayer does not work
2008-12-18T21:30:00.000Z	hischild	sisif	what do you mean doesn't work?
2008-12-18T21:30:00.000Z	sisif	hischild	: i mean: "E: Unable to find a source package for mplayer
2008-12-18T21:31:00.000Z	hischild	sisif	sudo apt-get build-dep mplayer <-- just works for me here
2008-12-18T21:32:00.000Z	sisif	hischild	: noup. I get the same error
2008-12-18T21:33:00.000Z	hischild	sisif	you have all the repo's enabled? And you got some reason to really need to compile it?
2008-12-18T21:34:00.000Z	sisif	hischild	: yes, I think I do. And I need to compile it because the repo version is not able to play encrypted DVD.
2008-12-18T21:41:00.000Z	sisif	hischild	: so any suggestion on what my cause that error ?
2008-12-18T21:42:00.000Z	hischild	sisif	not on that error, but you can dvd playback by checking what slart (iirc) gave you with !dvd
2008-12-18T21:43:00.000Z	sisif	hischild	: thank you
