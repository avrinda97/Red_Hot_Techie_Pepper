2010-02-01T22:02:00.000Z	Aboba	papul	are you using nautilus?
2010-02-01T22:02:00.000Z	papul	Aboba	yes
2010-02-01T22:02:00.000Z	papul		i clicked in the side panel where trash icon is displayed
2010-02-01T22:03:00.000Z	Aboba	papul	open a terminal, and try "sudo nautilus" and see if it works while you are root
2010-02-01T22:04:00.000Z	papul	Aboba	same thing trash doesn't open
2010-02-01T22:05:00.000Z	papul		?
2010-02-01T22:05:00.000Z	Aboba	papul	is this a new install, or did it just stop working?
2010-02-01T22:06:00.000Z	papul	Aboba	it just stoped working suddenly
2010-02-01T22:06:00.000Z	papul	Aboba	also my other partions stoped showing and computer doesn't open

2010-02-01T22:07:00.000Z	papul		!hi | Pipou
2010-02-01T22:07:00.000Z	papul	Aboba	?
2010-02-01T22:08:00.000Z	Aboba	papul	it probably would have been appropriate to mention the other symptoms at the beggining
2010-02-01T22:08:00.000Z	Aboba	papul	I've got no idea what is causing it. jsec mentioned something about missing gvfs-backends
2010-02-01T22:08:00.000Z	papul	Aboba	i told it on this channel earlier but nobody helped
