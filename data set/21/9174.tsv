2005-10-30T17:34:00.000Z	DruQks		Hey, new Ubuntu setup question. I have 15.7GB of free space, I tell the setup to use that. I have WinXP on my C: drive which I want to continue using. Should I have Ubuntu make the new partition a logical or primary one?
2005-10-30T17:35:00.000Z	bob2	DruQks	doesn't matter
2005-10-30T17:36:00.000Z	bob2	DruQks	except that windows will bitch if you have more than 4 primary partitions
2005-10-30T17:36:00.000Z	DruQks	bob2	Can I have 2 primary partitions on a HD?
2005-10-30T17:36:00.000Z	DruQks	bob2	what's the difference between a primary/logical one?
2005-10-30T17:36:00.000Z	bob2	DruQks	yes
2005-10-30T17:45:00.000Z	bob2	DruQks	you don't need a seperate boot partition at all
2005-10-30T17:45:00.000Z	DruQks	bob2	isn't it better?
2005-10-30T17:46:00.000Z	bob2	DruQks	no
2005-10-30T06:41:00.000Z	bob2	DruQks	sudo vim /etc/whatever
2005-10-30T06:43:00.000Z	DruQks	bob2	How do I save after editing? ;)
2005-10-30T06:43:00.000Z	bob2	DruQks	:wq
2005-10-30T07:50:00.000Z	bob2	DruQks	be way way less vague and maybe someone will
2005-10-30T07:51:00.000Z	DruQks	bob2	well. . . apparently having your wireless card in the travelmate 8104 work is quite a hassle. . . as well as the sound and some other stuff.
2005-10-30T07:51:00.000Z	bob2	DruQks	is it too late to return it?
2005-10-30T07:52:00.000Z	DruQks	bob2	yes, much too late :)
2005-10-30T07:53:00.000Z	bob2	DruQks	why on earth are you compiling a kernel to begin with?
2005-10-30T07:55:00.000Z	DruQks	bob2	the forum page I linked to says that I have to get a new kernel and change it in order for my wireless card, sound and misc. buttons on my laptop to work.
2005-10-30T07:58:00.000Z	DruQks	bob2	help me next!! :D
2005-10-30T07:59:00.000Z	bob2	DruQks	all I can suggest is looking for information about it in the wiki and linux-laptop.net
2005-10-30T07:59:00.000Z	DruQks	bob2	I already found it. . . even linked to it. . . just can't understand it and need help with it :)
