2009-09-14T10:48:00.000Z	`c00		hi, I changed my server root password using 'sudo passwd root' when logged in as zadmin
2009-09-14T10:48:00.000Z	`c00		before zadmin and my root password has the same password
2009-09-14T10:49:00.000Z	`c00		but after I changed my root password 'sudo <command>' doesn't ask the root password anymore
2009-09-14T10:49:00.000Z	`c00		when logged in as zadmin why is that?
2009-09-14T10:49:00.000Z	`c00		anyone could help?
2009-09-14T10:51:00.000Z	`c00		myrtti I want to changed the root password different from user I used my I install the os (user: admin)

2009-09-14T10:53:00.000Z	Flannel	`c00	Why do you want to set a root password?
2009-09-14T10:53:00.000Z	`c00	Flannel	I want to changed the root password different from user I used my I install the os (user: administrator)
2009-09-14T10:54:00.000Z	Flannel	`c00	The root password isn't set by default.  Your user's password is the password you use for sudo (again, not the root password, which doesn't exist)
2009-09-14T11:07:00.000Z	Flannel	`c00	It wasn't set, but then you set it, so now you can log in as root.
2009-09-14T10:59:00.000Z	Flannel	`c00	No, there is a root user, but it doesn't get used. It's impossible to log in as the root user.
2009-09-14T10:59:00.000Z	Flannel	`c00	No, 0 is the root user
2009-09-14T11:00:00.000Z	Flannel	`c00	1000 is just the first user created
2009-09-14T11:01:00.000Z	Flannel	`c00	What do you mean by "logging as root user"?  What command?
2009-09-14T11:04:00.000Z	`c00	Flannel	I tried changing the root password using 'sudo passwd root' and was able to do so
2009-09-14T11:04:00.000Z	`c00	Flannel	then I logout
2009-09-14T11:04:00.000Z	`c00	Flannel	when I tried to loggin as 'root' using the password I created I was able to logged in as root
2009-09-14T11:06:00.000Z	Flannel	`c00	Right, you can set it, but it's not set by default.  You really should disable it.
2009-09-14T11:07:00.000Z	Flannel	`c00	Thats because your password is cached.
2009-09-14T11:15:00.000Z	Flannel	`c00	`sudo passwd -l root` (thats a lowercase L)
