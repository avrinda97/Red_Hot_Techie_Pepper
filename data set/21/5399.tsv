2007-10-21T23:30:00.000Z	end0r57		how can i play .rm files?
2007-10-21T23:30:00.000Z	murkyMurk	end0r57	use realplay or maybe mplayer
2007-10-21T23:33:00.000Z	end0r57	murkyMurk	it says that it is not available, but it is referred to by another package.
2007-10-21T23:35:00.000Z	murkyMurk	end0r57	you need to get realplayer direct from realplayer although IIRC there is an 'Ubuntu way'. Just follow realplayers instructions and it'll work
2007-10-21T23:53:00.000Z	murkyMurk	end0r57	the app is called realplay not realplayer. it should be as easy as realplay <whatever.rm>
2007-10-21T23:57:00.000Z	end0r57	murkyMurk	i'm not able to find anything titled realplay.... just realplayer from real networks.
2007-10-21T23:57:00.000Z	murkyMurk	end0r57	have you downloaded the file from the realplayer website?
2007-10-21T23:58:00.000Z	end0r57	murkyMurk	yes
2007-10-21T23:58:00.000Z	murkyMurk	end0r57	great. did you make it executable like they said? with a chmod +x command?
2007-10-21T23:59:00.000Z	end0r57	murkyMurk	 the Bin directory is empty, however.
2007-10-22T00:00:00.000Z	murkyMurk	end0r57	all good so far,, and then did you do a sudo ./whatever the damn thing is called these days  ?
2007-10-22T00:00:00.000Z	end0r57	murkyMurk	i did. it then created a new directory and extracted a bunch of files.
2007-10-22T00:01:00.000Z	murkyMurk	end0r57	all good, all very good, now what happens if you just type realplay in a terminal?
2007-10-22T00:01:00.000Z	murkyMurk	end0r57	ahhhh.
2007-10-22T00:01:00.000Z	murkyMurk	end0r57	what about /usr/bin/realplay
2007-10-22T00:02:00.000Z	end0r57	murkyMurk	nothing
2007-10-22T00:03:00.000Z	end0r57	murkyMurk	i've got it now
2007-10-22T00:03:00.000Z	murkyMurk	end0r57	sweeettt..what was it?
2007-10-22T00:04:00.000Z	end0r57	murkyMurk	haha i was looking for the binary in the Bin directory but it was in a different directory located in the RealPlayer folder.
2007-10-22T00:04:00.000Z	end0r57	murkyMurk	thanks
2007-10-22T00:04:00.000Z	murkyMurk	end0r57	it's a learning curve. well done
