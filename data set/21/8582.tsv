2011-10-26T01:55:00.000Z	ry		actually, i used pcmanfm for a while
2011-10-26T01:55:00.000Z	ry		i liked it... but then i figured out how to make nautilus awesome
2011-10-26T01:56:00.000Z	ry		made pcmanfm obsolete mighty quick
2011-10-26T01:56:00.000Z	userone	ry	how did you make nautilus. it runs extremely slow on my system, and i have 4gb ram
2011-10-26T01:56:00.000Z	ry		define slow?
2011-10-26T01:56:00.000Z	ry		my system isnt anything super powerful either
2011-10-26T01:57:00.000Z	ry		i do have more ram
2011-10-26T01:57:00.000Z	userone	ry	13 minutes just to open, and thats before i can even pick a file!
2011-10-26T01:57:00.000Z	ry		wow
2011-10-26T01:57:00.000Z	ry		something is wrong, i've used nautilus on ancient systems and it wasnt slow
2011-10-26T01:58:00.000Z	ry		i'm running ubuntu 10.10 on a i5 520m / 8gb ram
2011-10-26T01:58:00.000Z	ry		but even with 4gb it ran great
2011-10-26T01:59:00.000Z	userone	ry	nautilus is the only slow app on my machine (dual core 4 gb ram 1gb nvidia graphics card 64 bit) so can you tell me what i am doing wrong, or at least where to start
2011-10-26T02:01:00.000Z	userone	ry	how did you make nautilus awesome?
2011-10-26T02:04:00.000Z	ry		i'm looking for a screenshot
2011-10-26T02:04:00.000Z	ry		yeah, the key to linux "user experience"
2011-10-26T02:04:00.000Z	ry		learn the shortcuts
2011-10-26T02:10:00.000Z	userone		so now nautilus is not responding and i have to do a force quit
2011-10-26T02:10:00.000Z	userone		1 am only using 1.1gb of 4gb
2011-10-26T02:10:00.000Z	ry	userone	pretty bad examples, but these are some random old screenshots i have that reveal nautilus (as well as other ui elements i suppose --   http://interestingsh.it/ry/img/index.php?path=ss/ )
2011-10-26T02:14:00.000Z	userone	ry	thanks. i just tried thunar and thats slow too. it must be the way the file manager is accessing my files ( i do have some massive cad/cgi files../.8GB single file!)
