2009-01-13T22:46:00.000Z	oholiab		what you just said
2009-01-13T22:47:00.000Z	oholiab		so, anyone used ushare at all?
2009-01-13T22:48:00.000Z	oholiab		I'm curious to talk to anyone who's had it working
2009-01-13T22:49:00.000Z	meganox	oholiab	have you tried fuppes?  are you using intrepid?  this is what i'm stuck on, can't satisfy dependencies
2009-01-13T22:50:00.000Z	oholiab	meganox	I managed that actually
2009-01-13T22:51:00.000Z	meganox	oholiab	any tips?
2009-01-13T22:51:00.000Z	oholiab	meganox	you can either apt-get it or use apt-get build-dep ushare and then compile from source
2009-01-13T22:51:00.000Z	oholiab	meganox	oh wait, do you mean fuppes or ushare?
2009-01-13T22:52:00.000Z	meganox	oholiab	lol, fuppes unfortunately
2009-01-13T22:52:00.000Z	meganox	oholiab	will try ushare
2009-01-13T22:53:00.000Z	oholiab	meganox	I'll give fuppes a try and get back to you
2009-01-13T23:00:00.000Z	oholiab	meganox	what was the first dependency error you got when you ran the ./configure?
2009-01-13T23:03:00.000Z	meganox	oholiab	libavcodec1d, installing from a deb from getdeb
2009-01-13T23:03:00.000Z	meganox	oholiab	oops, maybe it's a hardy deb, i just realised
2009-01-13T23:03:00.000Z	oholiab	meganox	sorry, that with fuppes or ushare?
2009-01-13T23:04:00.000Z	meganox	oholiab	fuppes.  have installed ushare now, just checking if it works
2009-01-13T23:06:00.000Z	meganox	oholiab	well fuppes is running but xbox doesn't see it
2009-01-13T23:07:00.000Z	oholiab	meganox	ushare is working for me, but the problem is that it sees every file as a music or video file
2009-01-13T23:08:00.000Z	oholiab	meganox	and it's not reading the ID3 tags so it thinks that every item is an album, artist, song and playlist
2009-01-13T23:09:00.000Z	meganox	oholiab	sounds bad.  fuppes looks good but it looks like i'm going to have to build it, which will have to wait till tomorrow
2009-01-13T23:10:00.000Z	meganox	oholiab	in fact i have to go now. good luck!
