2008-08-07T22:47:00.000Z	EdijusXP		New one question:  does ubuntu 8.04 supports wireless? I have advent 7204 laptop.
2008-08-07T22:48:00.000Z	XiXaQ	EdijusXP	it supports wireless. However, not all drivers can be supported or distributed.
2008-08-07T22:49:00.000Z	EdijusXP	XiXaQ	i'm on windows only becouse i cant connect to internet using linux.
2008-08-07T22:49:00.000Z	XiXaQ	EdijusXP	doesn't work, isn't working, etc, doesn't mean anything. If you go to a doctor, you wouldn't say, "I don't work properly, what's wrong?". You'd explain your symptoms.
2008-08-07T22:50:00.000Z	EdijusXP	XiXaQ	it tries connect, but it stucks
2008-08-07T22:51:00.000Z	XiXaQ	EdijusXP	are you able to connect to the wlan using another pc or another operating system on the same machine?
2008-08-07T22:51:00.000Z	EdijusXP	XiXaQ	the same pc on windows
2008-08-07T22:52:00.000Z	XiXaQ	EdijusXP	what kind of encryption does the network use?
2008-08-07T22:52:00.000Z	EdijusXP	XiXaQ	wep (hex) wpa psk
2008-08-07T22:53:00.000Z	XiXaQ	EdijusXP	if you disable encryption on the router, does it work?
2008-08-07T22:53:00.000Z	EdijusXP	XiXaQ	i have not tried or i do not remember
2008-08-07T22:57:00.000Z	EdijusXP	XiXaQ	How can I disable encryption?
2008-08-07T22:57:00.000Z	XiXaQ	EdijusXP	depends on your router.
2008-08-07T22:58:00.000Z	EdijusXP	XiXaQ	I have speedtouch thomson st585 v6
2008-08-07T22:58:00.000Z	XiXaQ	EdijusXP	sorry. It's outside the scope of the channel, and you'd probably figure it out way faster than I could, since I don't have access.
2008-08-07T22:59:00.000Z	XiXaQ	EdijusXP	somewhere in your routers configuration webapp, there should be an option to choose encryption method. It should also provide a "no encryption" option.
2008-08-07T22:59:00.000Z	EdijusXP	XiXaQ	Would be VNC enought?
2008-08-07T22:59:00.000Z	XiXaQ	EdijusXP	or something similar.
2008-08-07T23:00:00.000Z	XiXaQ	EdijusXP	that would have made it technically possible, but I don't have the time. I'm sure you will figure it out. Read your routers manual, or just explore it's interface. Have you used it before?
2008-08-07T23:01:00.000Z	EdijusXP	XiXaQ	OK. Thanks again, I will try when I have Ubuntu installed.
2008-08-07T23:04:00.000Z	XiXaQ	EdijusXP	good luck, and have fun :)
