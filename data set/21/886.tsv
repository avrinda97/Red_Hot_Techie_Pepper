2011-06-14T19:32:00.000Z	dragonkeeper		ccan someone help me with mounting a memory card  hub is shown in lsusb Bus 001 Device 007: ID 058f:6362 Alcor Micro Corp. Flash Card Reader/Writer    but no drive is found in fdisk
2011-06-14T19:33:00.000Z	escott	dragonkeeper	is there a dev entry /dev/sd? for this device? maybe you need to modprobe a driver
2011-06-14T19:34:00.000Z	dragonkeeper	escott	 well fdisk doesnt seen to show a /dev/sdx   for it
2011-06-14T19:35:00.000Z	escott	dragonkeeper	lsmod | grep usb_storage
2011-06-14T19:35:00.000Z	escott	dragonkeeper	if its not there please modprobe usb_storage
2011-06-14T19:36:00.000Z	dragonkeeper	escott	  usb_storage            53538  0      usb_storage highlighted red ?
2011-06-14T19:36:00.000Z	escott	dragonkeeper	the red highlight is greb highlighting the part it matched
2011-06-14T19:36:00.000Z	escott	dragonkeeper	there is this https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/366478
2011-06-14T19:37:00.000Z	escott	dragonkeeper	you might try unplugging replugging and looking at dmesg to see what the kernel says
2011-06-14T19:39:00.000Z	dragonkeeper	escott	 dmesg  registers the reader and removable disks
2011-06-14T19:39:00.000Z	escott	dragonkeeper	but it doesn't get a device node?
2011-06-14T19:40:00.000Z	dragonkeeper	escott	doesnt seem so   looks like just registers the empty slots
2011-06-14T19:44:00.000Z	escott	dragonkeeper	so its sdd/sde/sdf or sdg depending upon what type it is exactly SD/CF/SM or MS. you may have to try different combinations to figure it out but sudo mkdir /media/card; sudo mount /dev/sdd /media/card (and if that doesn't work try sde then sdf etc
2011-06-14T19:44:00.000Z	dragonkeeper	escott	ok ill try
2011-06-14T19:48:00.000Z	dragonkeeper	escott	| http://paste.ubuntu.com/626607/
2011-06-14T19:49:00.000Z	escott	dragonkeeper	there isn't a /dev/sdd?
2011-06-14T19:49:00.000Z	dragonkeeper	escott	 yes the 1st one i tried :S ?
2011-06-14T19:52:00.000Z	escott	dragonkeeper	im afraid im not too familiar with sd card readers. but it seems strange you aren't getting a device node. you could see if there is a /dev/block 11:0:0:0
2011-06-14T19:52:00.000Z	dragonkeeper	escott	ok  thanks for help though
2011-06-14T19:54:00.000Z	escott	dragonkeeper	is there an accessible device node coming at it from the scsi block address 11:0:0:0 (instead of the logical name like add)
2011-06-14T19:56:00.000Z	dragonkeeper	escott	 sorry i read it wrong    /dev/block is a dir  but file 11:0:0:0 doesnt exist
