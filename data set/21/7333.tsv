2009-07-24T21:32:00.000Z	JuJuBee		Do I need to do something special to play a standard audio cd in jaunty?
2009-07-24T21:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	JuJuBee	no
2009-07-24T21:33:00.000Z	JuJuBee	sebsebseb	when I insert one and try to open it via device notifier, it only offers extract with k3b or open with dolphin.  I cannot get anything to read it and play
2009-07-24T21:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	JuJuBee	your on Kubuntu?
2009-07-24T21:36:00.000Z	JuJuBee	sebsebseb	any ideas?
2009-07-24T21:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	JuJuBee	what happens when you open the CD up in amarok?
2009-07-24T21:39:00.000Z	JuJuBee	sebsebseb	where does an audiocd mount?
2009-07-24T21:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	JuJuBee	on the desktop normalley,  but  you should see it there in  computer, and in  /media/   or /mnt as well
2009-07-24T21:41:00.000Z	JuJuBee	sebsebseb	not in mnt or media and I don't have them mount on desktop.  However, in dolphin it shows on left bar and I can see the tracks, but cant get amarok to find it so I can play it.
2009-07-24T21:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	JuJuBee	ok  try another player
2009-07-24T21:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	JuJuBee	banshee :)  rythombox etc
2009-07-24T21:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	JuJuBee	VLC is more of a video player than a music player
2009-07-24T21:42:00.000Z	JuJuBee	sebsebseb	banshee is putting an x next to each track I try to play
2010-08-25T22:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	JuJuBee	You been trying to set up parentol controls?

2010-08-25T22:05:00.000Z	JuJuBee	sebsebseb	I can ping a workstation on LAN from gateway and anything on net but from  inside lan I cannot get out
2010-08-25T22:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	JuJuBee	I can't exactly help, you could try #kubuntu though
2010-08-25T22:06:00.000Z	JuJuBee	sebsebseb	ok
2010-08-25T22:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	JuJuBee	sadly sometimes, hardware support brakes, when upgrading Ubuntu versions
