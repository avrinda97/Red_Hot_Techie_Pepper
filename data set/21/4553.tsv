2008-04-03T03:55:00.000Z	Steven2	icanhasadmin	It just keeps saying I need Qt >= Qt 2.2.2(headers and libraries).
2008-04-03T03:55:00.000Z	Steven2	icanhasadmin	But I downloaded all the Qt I could see.
2008-04-03T04:00:00.000Z	icanhasadmin	Steven2	did you try the package i suggested before?
2008-04-03T04:00:00.000Z	Steven2	icanhasadmin	I've been downloading so many packages. Which one was that?
2008-04-03T04:01:00.000Z	icanhasadmin	Steven2	qt3-apps-dev
2008-04-03T04:01:00.000Z	Steven2	icanhasadmin	I already downloaded and installed that one.
2008-04-03T04:01:00.000Z	icanhasadmin	Steven2	1 sec
2008-04-03T04:02:00.000Z	Steven2	icanhasadmin	I just downloaded all the packages I could find with qt and -dev in them. So I got that one for sure.
2008-04-03T04:02:00.000Z	icanhasadmin	Steven2	wait are you on KDE?
2008-04-03T04:03:00.000Z	Steven2	icanhasadmin	No I don't believe so. I think it's still gnome running compiz.
2008-04-03T04:04:00.000Z	icanhasadmin	Steven2	you MIGHT want to try a ,/configure --with-qt-includes="path to your qt includes"
2008-04-03T04:04:00.000Z	Steven2	icanhasadmin	I don't know where qt includes is.
2008-04-03T04:06:00.000Z	icanhasadmin	Steven2	you make a valid point, honestly i'm not even sure where they would be, but if you can find them that just might work :D
2008-04-03T04:07:00.000Z	Steven2	icanhasadmin	I ran a search. 'No files found.'
2008-04-03T04:07:00.000Z	Steven2	icanhasadmin	You know what I just want a CD mount program. Is there another that's easier to install?
2008-04-03T04:08:00.000Z	icanhasadmin	Steven2	like for virtual cd drives?
2008-04-03T04:09:00.000Z	Steven2	icanhasadmin	Yes. Like Alcohol 120(win) and Daemon Tools(win).
2008-04-03T04:09:00.000Z	icanhasadmin	Steven2	i THINK arson does that? you might want to try nikrud's suggestion for the qt location
2008-04-03T04:20:00.000Z	icanhasadmin	Steven2	Not really, this isn't the place to discuss it but nano is much different in many ways.
2008-04-03T04:21:00.000Z	Steven2	icanhasadmin	Isn't there a command you can run in terminal to backup your grub.list?
2008-04-03T04:22:00.000Z	icanhasadmin	Steven2	sure there is, but that wouldn't really help if you can't boot to restore it :P
