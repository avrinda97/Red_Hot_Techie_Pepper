2005-06-08T15:00:00.000Z	glill32		Should I switch back to Windows XP so that my monitors can work right, or does Ubuntu also have the capability i need and I just can't find it?
2005-06-08T15:01:00.000Z	glill32		so I should just switch back to XP?
2005-06-08T15:03:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	glill32	on the binarydriverhowto there's a tip on dual monitors
2005-06-08T15:03:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	glill32	read the ati-section thoroughly
2005-06-08T15:21:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	glill32	have you tried sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and then specify your monitors specs to it?
2005-06-08T15:22:00.000Z	glill32	Fator_Dee	NO
2005-06-08T15:23:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	glill32	NO, as in you haven't tried it yet or NO as in it didn't work?
2005-06-08T15:26:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	glill32	I don't think you do? but the changes wont come to effect untill you restart X
2005-06-08T15:27:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	glill32	so you can just write the line again
2005-06-08T15:27:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	glill32	/ignore nick
2005-06-08T15:27:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	glill32	or /help ignore to maybe get more help on the ignore command
2005-06-08T15:32:00.000Z	glill32	Fator_Dee	my main monitor is working now, I need to figure out how to enable the other one!
2005-06-08T15:33:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	glill32	did you install that fglrx-control package that was mentioned?
2005-06-08T15:34:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	glill32	try to execute it from the terminal
2005-06-08T15:36:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	glill32	scroll is third mouse button
2005-06-08T15:37:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	glill32	your main screen is 0
2005-06-08T15:38:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	glill32	atleast that's my guess
2005-06-08T15:43:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	glill32	are you using hoary or warty?
2005-06-08T15:44:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	glill32	then it should be /etc/X11/xorg.conf, I don't know why it suggest that though
2005-06-09T16:02:00.000Z	glill32	Fator_Dee	THANKS!
2005-06-09T13:53:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	glill32	it works on my comp :-p so don't generalize
