2005-08-06T06:34:00.000Z	Harold		Anyone have a list of the largest packages on a standard Ubuntu install?
2005-08-06T06:34:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Harold	the whole install is about 1.8 gigs
2005-08-06T06:35:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Harold	the largest single packages are likely to be the gnoem libraries, the OO stuff and X
2005-08-06T06:35:00.000Z	Harold	Burgundavia	Exactly.  I want to remove some of the largest packages I don't need.
2005-08-06T06:35:00.000Z	Harold	Burgundavia	Thank you
2005-08-06T06:35:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Harold	almost nothing is installed by default is unneeded
2005-08-06T06:35:00.000Z	Harold	Burgundavia	I've removed OO, but not all the gnome libraries.
2005-08-06T06:35:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Harold	what DE are you running
2005-08-06T06:36:00.000Z	Harold	Burgundavia	I'm using xfce4 instead of gnome; can I safely removed the gnome libraries?
2005-08-06T06:36:00.000Z	Harold	Burgundavia	DE?
2005-08-06T06:36:00.000Z	Harold	Burgundavia	Developer environment?
2005-08-06T06:36:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Harold	some, synaptic will scream at you
2005-08-06T06:36:00.000Z	Harold	Burgundavia	Ah...I'm using xfce4.
2005-08-06T06:36:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Harold	synaptic will stop you from removing those that are necessary
2005-08-06T06:37:00.000Z	Harold	Burgundavia	Will apt-get scream at me too?  (I prefer using apt-get if possible.)
2005-08-06T06:38:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Harold	as long as you what you are doing, and follow what synaptic does, you shouldn
2005-08-06T06:39:00.000Z	Harold	Burgundavia	Sounds good.
2005-08-06T06:43:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Harold	yes
2005-08-06T06:43:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Harold	upgrading is going to be harder without them, though
2005-08-09T09:24:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Harold	the official gnome theme place is art.gnome.org
2005-08-09T09:24:00.000Z	Harold	Burgundavia	Thanks, I'll check that out.
