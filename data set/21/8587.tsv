2006-03-09T13:34:00.000Z	s|k		that's a seperate drive
2006-03-09T13:34:00.000Z	s|k		I printed some docs
2006-03-09T13:34:00.000Z	s|k		and I'm about to burn the image
2006-03-09T13:35:00.000Z	s|k		anything I should know before I jump in this?
2006-03-09T13:35:00.000Z	s|k		I've never installed linux before :0
2006-03-09T13:36:00.000Z	s|k		sweet
2006-03-09T13:36:00.000Z	s|k		I'm so tired of windows
2006-03-09T13:36:00.000Z	s|k		I'm looking to switch
2006-03-09T13:37:00.000Z	s|k		but I want to try it out on a partition
2006-03-09T13:37:00.000Z	s|k		if I've named the partition with windows, will ubuntu see the same name or will it just see the unformatted space?
2006-03-09T13:38:00.000Z	sethk	s|k	it will see the name, but in general, linux doesn't pay much attention to the name
2006-03-09T13:38:00.000Z	sethk	s|k	there is an option in the mount utility to mount by name, but only red hat (fedora) uses it AFAIK
2006-03-09T13:39:00.000Z	sethk	s|k	doesn't sound to me like you are in trouble, but maybe I don't understand the situation.  :)
2006-03-09T13:40:00.000Z	sethk	s|k	I still don't see why you think you are in trouble  :)
2006-05-15T12:34:00.000Z	sethk	s|k	grep -r
2006-11-07T07:46:00.000Z	sethk	s|k	netstat -a | egrep '^tcp'
2006-11-07T07:46:00.000Z	s|k	sethk	thanks :)
2006-11-07T07:46:00.000Z	sethk	s|k	yes, it is
2006-11-07T07:47:00.000Z	sethk	s|k	ssh uses tcp port 22, by default
2006-11-07T07:47:00.000Z	sethk	s|k	if you use n, as in   netstat -na, you can grep for 22
2006-11-07T07:47:00.000Z	s|k	sethk	oh thanks
