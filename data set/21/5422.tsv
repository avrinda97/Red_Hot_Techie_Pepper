2007-10-20T20:31:00.000Z	jdod		i have two 120g hard drives main drive is xp slave is ubuntu, if i disconnect the ubuntu drive i get grub errors and cant boot xp. how can i fix it?
2007-10-20T20:33:00.000Z	stefg	jdod	you're stealing grub's config file when you disconnect the ubuntu drive.
2007-10-20T20:33:00.000Z	jdod		so the grub file is on my xp drive?
2007-10-20T20:34:00.000Z	jdod		or part of it?
2007-10-20T20:34:00.000Z	jdod		or part of it is?
2007-10-20T20:34:00.000Z	stefg	jdod	the actaul boot loader is in the MBR of your XP-Drive, but it references /boot/grub/menu.lst on your ubuntu-drive
2007-10-20T20:35:00.000Z	stefg	jdod	do have an option in the Bios to select the device to boot from first?
2007-10-20T20:35:00.000Z	jdod		yes
2007-10-20T20:36:00.000Z	jdod	stefg	yes i do
2007-10-20T20:37:00.000Z	stefg	jdod	so you have to write grub's mbr part to the second (ubuntu) disk, and restore the XP-bootloader to the first disk. then let your BIOS look for the second disk first. If it's present it will boot grub, if it's disconnected the XP bootloader will be seen
2007-10-20T20:38:00.000Z	jdod	stefg	soif i just do a complete from scratch reinstall of everything what i need to do in the first place to avoid this?
2007-10-20T20:38:00.000Z	stefg	jdod	you'll end up with the same result
2007-10-20T20:39:00.000Z	jdod		lol that kinda sucks
2007-10-20T20:39:00.000Z	stefg	jdod	reinstalling is no cure for that. you need to understand what is what with the bootloader
2007-10-20T20:40:00.000Z	jdod		all im wanting to do is reinstall xp, but if i do thatll remove the grub config right?
2007-10-20T20:41:00.000Z	jdod		deluge works ok for me
2007-10-20T20:42:00.000Z	stefg	jdod	no it won't remove the grub *config* but only the MBR-part (which is perfect , because it was on the wrong disk anyway). The you have to boot up ubunt from Live CD and do a grub install to (hd1) instead of (hd0)...
2007-10-20T20:42:00.000Z	stefg		!grub | jdod
2007-10-20T20:43:00.000Z	jdod		so a boot floppy may help?
2007-10-20T20:44:00.000Z	stefg	jdod	google for 'super grub disk' , that'll help you
