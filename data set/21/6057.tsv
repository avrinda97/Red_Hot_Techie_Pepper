2007-06-12T09:32:00.000Z	Zenji		Cant anyone help me. I use alsamixer and when I run limewire I cant hear sound from Firefox.
2007-06-12T09:32:00.000Z	Zenji		I know a channel is in use or something, but everytime  I shut off limewire, my Firefox still has no sound.
2007-06-12T09:32:00.000Z	Zenji		:(
2007-06-12T09:33:00.000Z	VoX	Zenji	can you hear sound through firefox when you open flash?
2007-06-12T09:33:00.000Z	VoX	Zenji	if you go to, say, youtube, do you get sound through firefox?
2007-06-12T09:34:00.000Z	Zenji	VoX	its working now.
2007-06-12T09:35:00.000Z	VoX	Zenji	so it's only with limewire?
2007-06-12T09:35:00.000Z	Zenji	VoX	No its anything. If I play XMMS I cant hear sound on my emulator. Even when I turn the one using the sound off.
2007-06-12T09:36:00.000Z	VoX	Zenji	are your various programs set to use ALSA or OSS?
2007-06-12T09:36:00.000Z	Zenji	VoX	I have no idea.
2007-06-12T09:36:00.000Z	Zenji	VoX	I think ALSA. I am new at Ubuntu.
2007-06-12T09:36:00.000Z	Zenji	VoX	Whatever its set with from installation.
2007-06-12T09:37:00.000Z	VoX	Zenji	hm thats very strange. what sound card?
2007-06-12T09:38:00.000Z	VoX	Zenji	ah.
2007-06-12T09:38:00.000Z	Zenji	VoX	I literally have to like log out of restart the computer.
2007-06-12T09:38:00.000Z	Zenji	VoX	isnt there a way to like kill sound on all channels?
2007-06-12T09:38:00.000Z	VoX	Zenji	that is a limitation with the soundcard in question i would say. is it on-board sound?
2007-06-12T09:41:00.000Z	VoX	Zenji	well you can try 'sudo /etc/init.d/alsa restart'
2007-06-12T09:42:00.000Z	VoX	Zenji	hang a second
2007-06-12T09:43:00.000Z	VoX	Zenji	'sudo /etc/init.d/alsa-utils restart'
