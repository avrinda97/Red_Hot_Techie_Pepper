2005-12-18T10:02:00.000Z	bozel		when i start ubuntu, the desktop is black
2005-12-18T10:02:00.000Z	bozel		what should i do?
2005-12-18T10:03:00.000Z	tobi-wan[away] 	bozel	do you see gdm, where you can log in?
2005-12-18T10:04:00.000Z	tobi-wan[away] 	bozel	phrased differently, what's the last thing you see _before_ the screen goes black?
2005-12-18T10:10:00.000Z	tobi-wan[away] 	bozel	what is too fast?
2005-12-18T10:10:00.000Z	tobi-wan[away] 	bozel	when the screen goes blank, press ctrl-mod-f1
2005-12-18T10:14:00.000Z	tobi-wan[away] 	bozel	!? where did you get that error message from?
2005-12-18T10:16:00.000Z	tobi-wan[away] 	bozel	did you do anything to the computer or was it a clean install? /dev/hda normally is your harddisk (without the trailing slash, was that a typo from your side?)
2005-12-18T10:16:00.000Z	tobi-wan[away] 	bozel	well..... can you log in?
2005-12-18T10:17:00.000Z	tobi-wan[away] 	bozel	/dev/sda normally is a harddisk, tooo
2005-12-18T10:17:00.000Z	tobi-wan[away] 	bozel	where did you install ubuntu to?
2005-12-18T10:18:00.000Z	tobi-wan[away] 	bozel	fine.... what does ctrl-mod-f2 give you?
2005-12-18T10:18:00.000Z	tobi-wan[away] 	bozel	we need a login :-D
2005-12-18T10:19:00.000Z	tobi-wan[away] 	bozel	yes, please
2005-12-18T10:20:00.000Z	tobi-wan[away] 	bozel	open /var/log/Xorg.0.log and search for an error around the end
2005-12-18T10:20:00.000Z	tobi-wan[away] 	bozel	and while you are at it, do the same for dmesg (dmesg | tail)
2005-12-18T10:22:00.000Z	tobi-wan[away] 	bozel	go to the end of the file
2005-12-18T10:23:00.000Z	tobi-wan[away] 	bozel	rather dmesg | tail , for starters
2005-12-18T10:25:00.000Z	tobi-wan[away] 	bozel	it says [EE]  or something in the Xorg.0.log
2005-12-18T10:29:00.000Z	tobi-wan[away] 	bozel	anything else? this just says your touchpad won't work :-)
2005-12-18T10:30:00.000Z	tobi-wan[away] 	bozel	anything else? concerning this message, you should open /etc/X11/xorg.conf and delete all synaptics entries
