2005-06-01T16:21:00.000Z	shanon		Is there any docs on the differences / benefits of Ubuntu over Gentoo?
2005-06-01T16:22:00.000Z	shanon		I have been a long time gentoo user. But I am doing a re-install and have head lots of good things about ubuntu
2005-06-01T16:22:00.000Z	shanon		Ah I see
2005-06-01T16:24:00.000Z	shanon		I read that it is based on debian. I used debian a few years ago but the package management (mainly dealing with dependencies) was not very good
2005-06-01T16:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic	shanon	you must have used debian a *long* time ago
2005-06-01T16:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic	shanon	enlightenment is in the repos, but which version I don't know offhand
2005-06-01T16:31:00.000Z	thoreauputic	shanon	a new "stable" every 6 months
2005-06-01T16:32:00.000Z	shanon	thoreauputic	Can you update to the next stable via apt-get (or similar) or do you need to install off CD?
2005-06-01T16:33:00.000Z	thoreauputic	shanon	you just change sources and do a dist-upgrade
2005-06-01T05:33:00.000Z	thoreauputic	shanon	#ubuntu is fairly permissive in general ;)
2005-06-01T05:33:00.000Z	thoreauputic	shanon	too much so at times...
2005-06-04T13:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	shanon	reload before installing is advisable
2005-06-04T13:36:00.000Z	shanon	thoreauputic	But what about for updates / patches. Do I need to click reload for it to know about them?
2005-06-04T13:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	shanon	yes, unless you use the update manager, which does it automatically
2005-06-04T13:38:00.000Z	shanon	thoreauputic	Where do I configure the update manager ?
2005-06-04T13:38:00.000Z	thoreauputic	shanon	umm... I'm in fluxbox at the moment so I can't look
2005-06-04T13:39:00.000Z	shanon	thoreauputic	ok no problem I will poke around
2005-06-04T13:39:00.000Z	thoreauputic	shanon	or type ` sudo update-manager` in a terminal
2005-06-04T13:40:00.000Z	thoreauputic	shanon	quicker
2005-06-04T13:40:00.000Z	shanon	thoreauputic	Excellent thanks
2005-06-04T14:39:00.000Z	shanon	thoreauputic	hahaha
