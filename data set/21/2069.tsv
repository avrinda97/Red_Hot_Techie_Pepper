2010-01-29T01:50:00.000Z	Guest34964		i have a question: i connected my PC to my plasma TV through HDMI. but the sound doesn t go out from the TV speakers. how can i do this?
2010-01-29T01:51:00.000Z	miranda_82	Guest34964	are you using the pusleaudio applet?
2010-01-29T01:51:00.000Z	Guest34964	miranda_82	no and i don t know what it is :(
2010-01-29T01:52:00.000Z	Guest34964		i thought the sound would go naturrally and simply through the HDMI plug
2010-01-29T01:52:00.000Z	miranda_82	Guest34964	system, preferences, sound
2010-01-29T01:52:00.000Z	Guest34964		then i could redirect it to my hifi amp
2010-01-29T01:53:00.000Z	Guest34964	miranda_82	ok but what is it for? what do i have to change there?
2010-01-29T01:53:00.000Z	miranda_82	Guest34964	then go to Hardware, and under profile
2010-01-29T01:53:00.000Z	miranda_82	Guest34964	and then choose something like Digital Strereo
2010-01-29T01:53:00.000Z	miranda_82	Guest34964	if you dont have that option, you will possibly need to edit your alsa-base.conf file
2010-01-29T01:54:00.000Z	Guest34964	miranda_82	nice tip. i ll have a look then
2010-01-29T01:54:00.000Z	miranda_82	Guest34964	no problem! ITs quite confusing to find
2010-01-29T01:54:00.000Z	Guest34964		but will it still sound through the PC speakers? (they re not as bad, and using the 4 of them could be sweet)
2010-01-29T01:54:00.000Z	miranda_82		no
2010-01-29T01:54:00.000Z	miranda_82		you get both options under the profile settings
2010-01-29T01:55:00.000Z	Guest34964		oh ok so it is for GOOD file then :)
2010-01-29T01:55:00.000Z	Guest34964		i ll have a look
2010-01-29T01:55:00.000Z	miranda_82		kan somebody kick me from this channel please?
2010-01-29T01:55:00.000Z	miranda_82		!kick miranda_82
2010-01-29T01:55:00.000Z	miranda_82		balls
