2009-11-12T03:38:00.000Z	rdevoe		is there a gui or something that will help with showing a hdd that is mounted and partitioned? i just want the space for files
2009-11-12T03:39:00.000Z	Scunizi	rdevoe	gparted will show you your drives and allow you to partition/format them if needed..
2009-11-12T03:43:00.000Z	Scunizi	rdevoe	what's the sd(?) reference for it?
2009-11-12T03:43:00.000Z	Scunizi	rdevoe	sdb(what number)
2009-11-12T03:44:00.000Z	Scunizi	rdevoe	if you don't know then you can sudo fdisk -l to list all partitions and drives
2009-11-12T03:45:00.000Z	Scunizi	rdevoe	ok.. first  .. sudo mkdir /media/sdb1 .. then .. sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/sdb1 .. this should mount the drive.. if your system shows mounted drives on the desktop it should appear
2009-11-12T03:49:00.000Z	Scunizi	rdevoe	oh.. ok.. in terminal .. cd /media/sdb1 .. then ls to list any files that might be ther.
2009-11-12T03:51:00.000Z	Scunizi	rdevoe	try sudo mount -a
2009-11-12T03:51:00.000Z	Scunizi	rdevoe	also type only .. mount .. and it will list the partitions and where they are located.
2009-11-12T03:52:00.000Z	Scunizi	rdevoe	I'll send you a link from ubottu.. I"m stuck at this point..
2009-11-12T03:53:00.000Z	Scunizi	rdevoe	working now?
2009-11-12T03:54:00.000Z	Scunizi	rdevoe	try copying something there.. cp ~/Desktop/<file> /media/sdb1 ... then ls /media/sdb1 and see if anything shows up
2009-11-12T03:56:00.000Z	Scunizi	rdevoe	it assumes that you have a file on the Desktop and you list it in the line.. <file> is just a reference for what you need to type in
2009-11-12T03:57:00.000Z	Scunizi	rdevoe	then there aren't any files there.. copy something to it
2009-11-12T03:58:00.000Z	Scunizi	rdevoe	does crunchbang have a file manager like nautilus?
2009-11-12T03:58:00.000Z	Scunizi	rdevoe	use whatever you have to do it.
2009-11-12T03:59:00.000Z	Scunizi	rdevoe	ok.. try with that.. why'd you go with crunchbang?
2009-11-12T04:00:00.000Z	Scunizi	rdevoe	yep.. maybe xubuntu too.
2009-11-12T04:02:00.000Z	Scunizi	rdevoe	you may have to edit your fstab to include the drive .. then reboot .. not sure if a logout login would accomplish the same thing
2009-11-12T04:04:00.000Z	Scunizi	rdevoe	you might be able to sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop
2009-11-12T04:08:00.000Z	Scunizi	rdevoe	:)
