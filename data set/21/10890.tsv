2005-12-28T11:31:00.000Z	crimsun	chapium	do you have python-id3lib installed?
2005-12-28T11:34:00.000Z	chapium	crimsun	looks like its ok
2005-12-28T11:34:00.000Z	crimsun	chapium	what's ok?
2005-12-28T11:34:00.000Z	crimsun	chapium	meaning that it parses id3 tags?
2005-12-28T11:35:00.000Z	chapium	crimsun	yes
2005-12-28T13:12:00.000Z	crimsun	chapium	yes.
2005-12-28T13:16:00.000Z	crimsun	chapium	in what sense? It all goes into your library. To add, Music> Add Location
2005-12-28T13:17:00.000Z	chapium	crimsun	just checking to make sure there wasnt another view or something.   The library's not the best place for a radio thing since it never ends
2005-12-28T13:17:00.000Z	crimsun	chapium	where would you put it?
2005-12-28T13:18:00.000Z	chapium	crimsun	well, in other media players there would be a section for it.  Other wise it would get stuck on that station as it cycles through songs.  Playlists could control this i suppose
2005-12-28T13:18:00.000Z	crimsun	chapium	"another section" being Another Library. In the end, it's just a Library.
2005-12-28T13:19:00.000Z	chapium	crimsun	i guess my point is internet radio should be separate from music files that generally end at some point
2005-12-28T13:19:00.000Z	chapium	crimsun	a lot of streaming audio does not ever end
2005-12-28T13:20:00.000Z	crimsun	chapium	that's a simple library perspective
2005-12-28T13:20:00.000Z	crimsun	chapium	remember that quod libet's objective isn't enforcing any organisation. /You/ do that. Use its regexes.
2005-12-28T13:21:00.000Z	chapium	crimsun	argh philosophies
2005-12-28T13:22:00.000Z	chapium	crimsun	anyways, i do not see this open location option next to add music
2005-12-28T13:22:00.000Z	crimsun	chapium	I'm using quod libet 0.16-1 in Dapper/universe.
2005-12-28T13:23:00.000Z	chapium	crimsun	ah
2005-12-28T13:47:00.000Z	chapium	crimsun	thanks for the tip on quod .16.. that thing's a piece of cake to install
2005-12-30T12:26:00.000Z	crimsun	chapium	it's suezah
