2011-01-02T23:36:00.000Z	Grav		Hi. Anyone knows if I can use Ubuntu with notebook. I have system on 3,5 HDD, and wanted to buy external HDD enclosure so I can connect it to notebook USB. But wanted to ask here before I buy it.
2011-01-02T23:38:00.000Z	txomon	Grav	u can use it
2011-01-02T23:39:00.000Z	txomon	Grav	but dont use the external drive to boot ubuntu
2011-01-02T23:39:00.000Z	Grav	txomon	I wanted it to boot Ubuntu. Will it not work or it will be slower?
2011-01-02T23:42:00.000Z	Grav	txomon	So it is possible to boot ubuntu from external drive?
2011-01-02T23:42:00.000Z	txomon	Grav	how much space do u have in the local hdd?
2011-01-02T23:43:00.000Z	Grav	txomon	It's not about space. I have to work on notebook, that isn't mine, and wanted to use my hdd with ubuntu.
2011-01-02T23:44:00.000Z	txomon	Grav	does it have sd ?
2011-01-02T23:46:00.000Z	Grav	txomon	sd?
2011-01-02T23:47:00.000Z	txomon	Grav	yep, SD slot... if it has it, I would recommend to use it as local drive for ubuntu
2011-01-02T23:47:00.000Z	txomon	Grav	because if you use a external hard drive, and electricity goes out, or it accidentaly disconects, you can harm your sistem
2011-01-02T23:48:00.000Z	Grav	txomon	Can i use 3,5 hdd as a local drive for notebook?
2011-01-02T23:48:00.000Z	txomon	Grav	yes you can
2011-01-02T23:53:00.000Z	Grav	txomon	Could be a good Idea
2011-01-02T23:54:00.000Z	txomon	Grav	how much time is that notebook going to belong to you? becouse if it is for sporadical use, use a live distro
2011-01-02T23:54:00.000Z	Grav	txomon	few months
2011-01-02T23:55:00.000Z	txomon	Grav	for example one my university's teacher bought a harddrive for the notebook they gave him
2011-01-02T23:56:00.000Z	txomon	Grav	you always can use that drive as external buying a box
2011-01-02T23:58:00.000Z	txomon	Grav	 format the Hdd, and when you need to give it back, restore it
2011-01-02T23:59:00.000Z	Grav	txomon	interesting idea, but i think i will go with another notebook drive.
2011-01-03T00:00:00.000Z	Grav	txomon	You know some programs i could, clone my old hdd to new?
