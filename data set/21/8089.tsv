2006-06-02T12:36:00.000Z	piratepenguin		if I'm playing a game in fullscreen, is there a way to make ALT + TAB or something minimize the game?
2006-06-02T12:37:00.000Z	Warbo	piratepenguin	It would depend on the game probably
2006-06-02T12:37:00.000Z	piratepenguin	Warbo	in bzflag I can't get out of it atall without exiting
2006-06-02T12:37:00.000Z	Warbo	piratepenguin	If I wanted to do that, I would run it in it's own Xserver and switch back to GNOME with ctrl-alt-f7
2006-06-02T12:38:00.000Z	piratepenguin	Warbo	thanks
2006-06-02T12:38:00.000Z	Warbo	piratepenguin	System Tools > New Login lets you do that without any command line stuff
2006-06-02T12:39:00.000Z	piratepenguin	Warbo	neat, cheers
2006-06-02T13:30:00.000Z	Warbo	piratepenguin	I am using it now
2006-06-02T13:30:00.000Z	piratepenguin	Warbo	what engine?
2006-06-02T13:30:00.000Z	Warbo	piratepenguin	Xine
2006-06-02T13:36:00.000Z	piratepenguin	Warbo	gxine wont play anything for me either
2006-06-02T13:37:00.000Z	Warbo	piratepenguin	I hate GXine, but keep it for it's radio stations :)
2006-06-02T15:08:00.000Z	piratepenguin	Warbo	I don't have "System Tools > New Login" on 6.06.. what comand does that run?
2006-06-02T15:09:00.000Z	Warbo	piratepenguin	gdmflexiserver
2006-06-02T15:09:00.000Z	piratepenguin	Warbo	thanks
2006-06-02T15:13:00.000Z	piratepenguin	Warbo	Bah sure DRI can only be enabled for 1 Xserver, and that's the first one that was started :(
2006-06-02T15:13:00.000Z	piratepenguin	Warbo	thanks for the help anyhow
2006-06-02T15:14:00.000Z	Warbo	piratepenguin	I've never used DRI, I don't think nvidia can use it
2006-06-11T13:07:00.000Z	Warbo	piratepenguin	nv driver essentially just uses graphics card as a monitor port. All of the work is done in your CPU
2006-06-11T13:08:00.000Z	piratepenguin	Warbo	we're talking about sound drivers ;)
2006-06-11T13:08:00.000Z	Warbo	piratepenguin	Oh, soryy (Nvidia!=Sound to me :))
