2010-10-10T13:46:00.000Z	terminalvelocity		to upgrade to 10.10 must i do aclean install or is there a way to upgrade from lucid without losing all the software?
2010-10-10T13:46:00.000Z	soreau	terminalvelocity	After it's released, ubuntu should prompt you to update. If not, use 'gksu update-manager -d'
2010-10-10T13:49:00.000Z	terminalvelocity	soreau	so the upgrade from lucid does not require reinstalling the os, i can upgrade directly from the update manager?
2010-10-10T13:51:00.000Z	soreau	terminalvelocity	Yes, you can upgrade without clean installing. This usually works if you haven't made any modifications to your system
2010-10-10T13:51:00.000Z	soreau	terminalvelocity	If you have added packages, have any strange bugs or other things going on, you should do a clean install
2010-10-10T13:51:00.000Z	soreau	terminalvelocity	To avoid headaches and problems
2010-10-10T13:53:00.000Z	terminalvelocity	soreau	so the new 10.10 is basically a refined version of lucid? or is it likley to have lots of issues because the developers were rushed to meet their deadline or somthing like that?
2010-10-10T14:02:00.000Z	soreau	terminalvelocity	I am a hobbyist developer and help wherever I can
2010-10-10T13:54:00.000Z	soreau	terminalvelocity	No. The way Linux works is, there is a kernel and GNU apps developed constantly all the time upstream, as well as the multitude of other software that runs on linux. Every 6 months, ubuntu and other major distributions make a release which takes all of this code and they try to make the most stable system while still providing latest code and features
2010-10-10T13:55:00.000Z	soreau	terminalvelocity	Sometimes there are occasional bugs and regressions but that just comes with the Linux. No one can possibly catch every single bug or problem.
2010-10-10T13:56:00.000Z	soreau	terminalvelocity	The common goal is to improve software, support new hardware and eliminate bugs
2010-10-10T13:58:00.000Z	terminalvelocity	soreau	HP hardware had lots of sound issues with lucid. is that likly to be fixed?
2010-10-10T13:59:00.000Z	soreau	terminalvelocity	I have no idea.
2010-10-10T14:00:00.000Z	soreau	terminalvelocity	You would have to grab a live cd and test it. But the common goal is to make it better and you can help by filing a bug report about any issue you're having
2010-10-10T14:00:00.000Z	terminalvelocity	soreau	i take it that you are one of the developers?
2010-10-10T14:02:00.000Z	soreau	terminalvelocity	I work on the compiz project a lot. but not a 'ubuntu dev'
2010-10-10T14:05:00.000Z	terminalvelocity	soreau	aaah good, because i think that it is compiz that somtimes does not give the windows a menu bar(with the x, square, and underscore to minimize)...perhaps you could tell me how to fix that or will it not be an issue with 10.10
2010-10-10T14:06:00.000Z	soreau	terminalvelocity	That is a bug that has been a common issue with ubuntu 10.04. My theory is they start compiz too fast before X or the drivers are ready
2010-10-10T14:07:00.000Z	soreau	terminalvelocity	There's a lot of things you can do to try and workaround it but I really hope it's fixed in 10.10 (I would expect nothing less)
2010-10-10T14:08:00.000Z	terminalvelocity	soreau	is ther a patch or somthing that fixes it?
2010-10-10T14:09:00.000Z	soreau	terminalvelocity	No, it's just a trial and error diagnoses you have to do in order to try and figure out the real problem. The fact is that it is a ubuntu bug and not a problem with compiz though
