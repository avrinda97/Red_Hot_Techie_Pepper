2006-06-27T14:52:00.000Z	LjL		it's the main cd, it's the first link from the left, i really don't understand why people keep doubting that it's the "real" ubuntu cd :\
2006-06-27T14:53:00.000Z	swaj	LjL	 most operating systems don't install from a LiveCD :P
2006-06-27T15:01:00.000Z	LjL	swaj	a few operating systems do install from a "live cd", although it isn't necessarily called a "live cd" since that's simply the way they've always been installed
2006-06-27T15:02:00.000Z	swaj	LjL	livecd's are not commonly used for system installs, which is why a lot of people are confused.  Usually the LiveCD is used for testing whether the distribution will work at all, and then subsequent disc downloads allow for actual installation.
2006-06-27T15:02:00.000Z	LjL	swaj	at any rate, the first line of the paragraph describing the Desktop CD (right where you download it) says "The desktop CD allows you to try Ubuntu without changing your computer at all, and at your option to install it permanently later."
2006-06-27T15:03:00.000Z	swaj	LjL	agreed, but confusion abounds
2006-06-27T15:04:00.000Z	LjL	swaj	barongas: or more likely cp -a blah blah
2006-06-27T15:05:00.000Z	swaj	LjL	-R is a recursive copy and works fine ;)
2006-06-27T15:05:00.000Z	LjL	swaj	why would you use "sudo su - root"?
2006-06-27T15:05:00.000Z	swaj	LjL	he asked how to become root, and I answered him
2006-06-27T15:05:00.000Z	LjL	swaj	yeah, except it doesn't preserve ownerships and it follows symlinks. not what you want normally
2006-06-27T15:05:00.000Z	LjL	swaj	but that's a bad answer. "sudo -i" is a much better one
2006-06-27T15:06:00.000Z	swaj	LjL	either way is fine
2006-06-27T15:08:00.000Z	LjL	swaj	sudo -i has always been the very much recommended way on this channel and elsewhere in the ubuntu documentation. sudo su is redundant, at the very least
2006-06-27T15:09:00.000Z	swaj	LjL	whatever
2006-06-27T15:13:00.000Z	swaj	LjL	except that sudo just lets you execute a command as root, where su lets you become root.  If you don't know your root password, then sudo su is a viable solution.  Redundant? I think not.
2006-06-27T15:14:00.000Z	LjL	swaj	eh? so, how *exactly* does "sudo -i" *not* let you become root?
2006-06-27T15:14:00.000Z	swaj	LjL	I never said it didn't, but sudo su isn't redundant
2006-06-27T15:15:00.000Z	LjL	swaj	i just explained to dura why it is. "sudo" is a command that changes your privileges. "su" is also a command that changes your privileges. using both is redundant, since sudo alone is perfectly sufficient.
2006-06-27T15:16:00.000Z	swaj	LjL	it's just 2 different ways to accomplish the same thing
2006-06-27T15:16:00.000Z	LjL	swaj	one of which is redundant, yes.
