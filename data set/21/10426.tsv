2005-03-16T07:09:00.000Z	joeblow1234	usual	i think it is for all the protocols supported by gaim (msn, aim, yahoo, etc.)
2005-03-16T07:10:00.000Z	joeblow1234	usual	gaim-vv.sourceforge.net
2005-03-16T07:18:00.000Z	joeblow1234	usual	is 2.6.11.1 going to be the last? on lwn.net it said that 2.6.11.1 was released as a security and bug fix
2005-03-16T07:19:00.000Z	usual	joeblow1234	2.6.11 includes some breakthrough changes I read
2005-03-16T07:22:00.000Z	joeblow1234	usual	what r ur specs?
2005-03-16T07:22:00.000Z	usual	joeblow1234	it's not a hardware issue, it's just recently, no other dists do it, even ubuntu warty
2005-03-16T07:24:00.000Z	joeblow1234	usual	to check and see if it works better than the converted deb
2005-03-16T07:25:00.000Z	usual	joeblow1234	he should build his own deb or just install it from source
2005-03-16T07:26:00.000Z	joeblow1234	usual	if im not mistaken hoary is still in beta
2005-03-16T07:27:00.000Z	usual	joeblow1234	yeah it's not stable yet
2005-03-16T07:27:00.000Z	joeblow1234	usual	i meant to say alpha
2005-03-16T07:27:00.000Z	joeblow1234	usual	as in not to be used if u need a stable desktop
2005-03-16T07:27:00.000Z	usual	joeblow1234	I don't need a stable desktop, but this lag is annoying
2005-03-16T07:29:00.000Z	joeblow1234	usual	the rpm didnt install any files on the system for him...it just didnt do anything
