2009-06-04T00:38:00.000Z	earthlander		Does anyone know about a bug with the system monitor and CPU ?
2009-06-04T00:39:00.000Z	Slart	earthlander	what kind of bug?
2009-06-04T00:40:00.000Z	Slart	earthlander	hmm.. and there's nothing in the process list? an old firefox process running amok or something like that?
2009-06-04T00:40:00.000Z	Slart	earthlander	make sure you click the view menu.. and select "All"
2009-06-04T00:43:00.000Z	earthlander	Slart	for some reason i can't access my app places or system files its like they are frozen neither are my open windows showing on the bottom bar
2009-06-04T00:43:00.000Z	Slart	earthlander	do you have a terminal open?
2009-06-04T00:44:00.000Z	earthlander	Slart	and there is 5 python processes
2009-06-04T00:44:00.000Z	Slart	earthlander	using lots of processor power?
2009-06-04T00:45:00.000Z	earthlander	Slart	no
2009-06-04T00:46:00.000Z	Slart	earthlander	anything using more than a couple percent of the cpu?
2009-06-04T00:46:00.000Z	Slart	earthlander	you can sort by processor usage
2009-06-04T00:47:00.000Z	earthlander	Slart	the gnome panel is toping at 50%
2009-06-04T00:48:00.000Z	Slart	earthlander	hmm.. gnome-panel doesn't usually do that.. try killing it
2009-06-04T00:48:00.000Z	earthlander	Slart	but how come the second is flatlining at 100%
2009-06-04T00:49:00.000Z	Slart	earthlander	well.. if gnome-panel is using 50% of your available processor power.. it is using one whole core out of two, right?
2009-06-04T00:49:00.000Z	earthlander	Slart	it worked
2009-06-04T00:49:00.000Z	earthlander	Slart	and YES
2009-06-04T00:49:00.000Z	Slart	earthlander	did gnome-panel restart automatically?
2009-06-04T00:50:00.000Z	earthlander	Slart	i stoped it and the cpu usage droped
2009-06-04T00:51:00.000Z	Slart	earthlander	it shouldn't really be necessary.. gnome panel should behave
2009-06-04T00:51:00.000Z	Slart	earthlander	without being put in a leach
