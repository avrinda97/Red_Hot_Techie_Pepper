2005-03-24T08:52:00.000Z	gilles	apokryphos	Pyre: i know thanks, i did install the codecs, as i said
2005-03-24T08:52:00.000Z	apokryphos	gilles	what are you oepning it with?
2005-03-24T08:53:00.000Z	gilles	apokryphos	totem
2005-03-24T08:53:00.000Z	apokryphos	gilles	I had problems playing .mov a while back with that too, IIRC. Have you tried using one of the other players?
2005-03-24T08:54:00.000Z	apokryphos	gilles	xine? And... did you follow the instructions for installing mplayer? It is recommended that you get a specific package.
2005-03-24T08:54:00.000Z	gilles	apokryphos	i have totem-gstreamer, it can't play anything
2005-03-24T08:55:00.000Z	gilles	apokryphos	ok, i'll try totem-xine instead
2005-03-24T08:55:00.000Z	apokryphos	gilles	what? Just try playing with the xine player..
2005-03-24T08:56:00.000Z	apokryphos	gilles	if installing mplayer, make sure you follow the instructions for getting the specific one as suggested in the aforementioned link.
2005-03-24T08:56:00.000Z	apokryphos	gilles	it's likely that it won't work without it; I had the same problem.
2005-04-02T16:32:00.000Z	apokryphos	gilles	You will likely want to look into getting ALSA with the dmix plugin set up
2005-04-02T16:35:00.000Z	gilles	apokryphos	what package should i install, and what may i change in the system preferences ?
2005-04-02T16:36:00.000Z	apokryphos	gilles	remind me again of the problem
2005-04-02T16:36:00.000Z	gilles	apokryphos	no system sound and sound in totem at the same time
2005-04-02T16:37:00.000Z	apokryphos	gilles	oh yes. http://resolute.ucsd.edu/diwaker/articles/howtos/howto-alsa-dmix.html
2005-04-02T16:38:00.000Z	gilles	apokryphos	that looks very complicated... it's not for me
2005-04-02T16:38:00.000Z	apokryphos	gilles	don't be put off. It's simple file-editing.
2005-04-07T06:10:00.000Z	apokryphos	gilles	I don't think so; I tend to just keep Ctrl down while moving left/right with Shift.
2005-04-07T06:10:00.000Z	apokryphos	gilles	though, of course, for deleting the whole line, using home/end comes in more handy.
