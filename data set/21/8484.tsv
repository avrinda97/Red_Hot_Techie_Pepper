2006-07-09T14:06:00.000Z	Hexidigital		how can i set fluxbox as my default gui? i am running a LAMP server, but i need a small GUI, and i cannot get "startfluxbox" to work w/o starting X (which loads GDM)
2006-07-09T14:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	Hexidigital	 somthing you just said seems wring..
2006-07-09T14:07:00.000Z	Hexidigital	dr_willis	i know... server and GUI do not go together
2006-07-09T14:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	Hexidigital	 you tried eding/making a .xinitrc and  having it load fluxbox ?
2006-07-09T14:08:00.000Z	Hexidigital	dr_willis	nope... i missed the obvious fix... brb
2006-07-09T14:08:00.000Z	dr_willis	Hexidigital	 i dont see how startfluxbox starts up gdm :P
2006-07-09T14:08:00.000Z	Hexidigital	dr_willis	no... startfluxbox needs me to load X first, but i "startx" and GDM auto loads
2006-07-09T14:09:00.000Z	Hexidigital	dr_willis	where do i create an .xinitrc?
2006-07-09T14:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	Hexidigital	 startx should not start up gdm. it should start whats in the .xinitrc file or tye system wide xinitrc.   sounds like ya can just put startfluxbox in your .xinitrc make one in your home dir
2006-07-09T14:09:00.000Z	Hexidigital	dr_willis	thx
2006-07-09T14:14:00.000Z	Hexidigital	dr_willis	my xinitrc file just has ./etc/X11/Xsession.... do i just add fluxbox somewhere?
2006-07-09T14:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	Hexidigital	 thats the system wide one. read what it does/reads - it proberly loads some config files.. OR make a .xinitrc in your home dir.
2006-07-09T14:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	Hexidigital	 example .xinitrc 2 lines... xterm &   exec fluxbox
2006-07-09T14:17:00.000Z	Hexidigital	dr_willis	thx again :)
2006-07-09T14:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	Hexidigital	 ya could read the Xsession and see what their sample does fora default
2006-07-09T14:21:00.000Z	Hexidigital	dr_willis	you are great! all i did was delete /etc/X11/Xsession and type xterm & exec fluxbox, and it works! thanks
2006-07-09T14:22:00.000Z	dr_willis	Hexidigital	 does it pop up a xterm as well? :P
2006-07-09T14:22:00.000Z	dr_willis	Hexidigital	 ya could try just using 'startfluxbox'
2006-07-09T14:23:00.000Z	Hexidigital	dr_willis	hmm... not sure what it did :) brb
2006-07-09T14:23:00.000Z	dr_willis	Hexidigital	 my guess 'startfluxbox' setups and installs a few extra support programs as well
2006-07-09T14:25:00.000Z	Hexidigital	dr_willis	works like a charm now! thank you very much
