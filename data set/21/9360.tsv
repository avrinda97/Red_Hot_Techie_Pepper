2007-02-14T10:40:00.000Z	soundray	blazemonger	^^ (ubotu)
2007-02-14T10:49:00.000Z	soundray	blazemonger	the definition of 'stable' and 'unstable' varies between people and distributions.
2007-02-14T10:50:00.000Z	soundray	blazemonger	ubuntu is trying to be rock-solid stable in major releases
2007-02-14T11:03:00.000Z	soundray	blazemonger	consider the possibility that something is wrong with your installation, and not with ubuntu.
2007-02-14T11:04:00.000Z	soundray	blazemonger	use 'top' to see whether something is hogging your CPU
2007-02-14T11:34:00.000Z	soundray	blazemonger	this is a support channel, not a slag-off-ubuntu channel. If you want help, you've got to try the suggestions that you read here.
2007-02-14T11:40:00.000Z	soundray	blazemonger	you are spamming, please stop it now
2007-02-14T11:44:00.000Z	soundray	blazemonger	nobody except you experiences the trouble you describe with Gnome. It is specific to your setup
2007-02-14T11:46:00.000Z	soundray	blazemonger	the fact that sid works *proves* that it's your setup
2007-02-14T11:46:00.000Z	soundray	blazemonger	you have misconfigured something in ubuntu, or something is hogging your CPU.
2007-02-14T11:48:00.000Z	soundray	blazemonger	yes
2007-02-14T11:50:00.000Z	soundray	blazemonger	only if you tell it to explicitly
2007-02-14T11:54:00.000Z	soundray	blazemonger	ubuntu runs as well as any other distribution on modern PCs
2007-02-14T11:55:00.000Z	soundray	blazemonger	I'm telling you, it's your setup
2007-02-14T11:55:00.000Z	soundray	blazemonger	your ubuntu setup
2007-02-14T11:56:00.000Z	soundray	blazemonger	no, I'm saying your personal individual local ubuntu installation is broken
2007-02-14T11:59:00.000Z	soundray	blazemonger	it seems that I won't be able to convince you that nothing is wrong with ubuntu as a distribution.
2007-02-14T11:59:00.000Z	soundray	blazemonger	neither can I seem to get you to try some diagnostics on your system.
2007-02-14T11:59:00.000Z	soundray	blazemonger	now will you please stop abusing the channel for slagging off the distribution. This is not what it is for.
