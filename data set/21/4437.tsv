2011-09-12T05:50:00.000Z	dr_willis		good old amazon changeing stuff for their ec2 stuff :)
2011-09-12T05:51:00.000Z	smw	dr_willis	how else ubuntu does not change much for their ec2 images.
2011-09-12T05:52:00.000Z	smw	dr_willis	considering it is just another ubuntu install... why not?
2011-09-12T05:53:00.000Z	smw	dr_willis	the ubuntu images are officially made by canonical and have very few changes.
2011-09-12T05:54:00.000Z	smw	dr_willis	they make sudo passwordless (better than the alternatives) and run a script at boot called cloud-init. All else is the same.
2011-09-12T05:54:00.000Z	dr_willis	smw	 if you say so. ive never really looked into it.
2011-09-12T05:55:00.000Z	dr_willis	smw	 i definatly seen others in here with strange ubuntu setups on other hosting providers. :) good to know ec2 is at least 'sane'
2011-09-12T05:55:00.000Z	smw	dr_willis	and if people have cloud specific questions... there is always #ubuntu-cloud and ##aws :-)
2011-09-12T05:56:00.000Z	smw	dr_willis	yeah. ec2 has its quirks though. On first boot ubuntu fetches the ssh public key for the root account (named ubuntu with sudo NOPASS).
2011-09-12T05:57:00.000Z	smw	dr_willis	it then sets hostname and that is pretty much it.
2011-10-14T11:04:00.000Z	smw	dr_willis	gnome-panel I think
2011-10-21T09:13:00.000Z	smw	dr_willis	no, something to just ask for $HOME. Nothing else.
2011-10-21T09:14:00.000Z	smw	dr_willis	they you don't become immune to the -i messages but it still stops you
2011-10-21T09:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	smw	there exist safer rm scripts. i recall
2011-10-21T09:14:00.000Z	smw	dr_willis	interesting
2012-06-26T10:01:00.000Z	smw	dr_willis	although I did not learn from it originally, http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/ taught me something. (specifically pushd popd)
2012-06-26T10:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	smw	 :) Oreialys Using Bash book. is a must have. ;)
2012-06-26T10:01:00.000Z	smw	dr_willis	:-)
2012-06-26T10:02:00.000Z	smw	dr_willis	I suggest taking a look at lthw. I read it to evaluate giving out to others, and I was impressed
2012-06-26T10:02:00.000Z	smw	dr_willis	didn't learn much, but it taught me the proper usage of pushd and popd which before reading, I thought were stupid commands :-)
2012-10-03T14:14:00.000Z	smw	dr_willis	yes, a dozen ways to do it :-)
