2012-08-18T02:29:00.000Z	coldpizza72i		Can someone help me setup my nfs server... Im having many problems
2012-08-18T02:30:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	coldpizza72i	 i use NFS, let's hear it
2012-08-18T02:31:00.000Z	coldpizza72i	MonkeyDust	rpc.nfsd: writing fd to kernel failed: errno 111 (Connection refused)
2012-08-18T02:31:00.000Z	coldpizza72i	MonkeyDust	I cant get the nfs service running
2012-08-18T02:32:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	coldpizza72i	 what was the command you gave to make it run?
2012-08-18T02:32:00.000Z	coldpizza72i	MonkeyDust	I think post 7 might help me, but im not sure how to set the custom rules or anything http://forums.fedoraforum.org/showthread.php?t=252180
2012-08-18T02:32:00.000Z	coldpizza72i	MonkeyDust	"sudo /etc/init.d/nfs-kernel-server start  "
2012-08-18T02:33:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	coldpizza72i	 both regular pc's, local and remote?
2012-08-18T02:33:00.000Z	coldpizza72i	MonkeyDust	huh?
2012-08-18T02:34:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	coldpizza72i	 NFS is to mount a remote partition locally, so are both machines normal pc's?
2012-08-18T02:35:00.000Z	coldpizza72i	MonkeyDust	what do you mean by normal
2012-08-18T02:36:00.000Z	coldpizza72i		THe server will run on my ubuntu desktop and client on my macbook
2012-08-18T02:36:00.000Z	coldpizza72i	MonkeyDust	^^
2012-08-18T02:36:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	coldpizza72i	 so it's a mac, it's not a regular pc, that's why i asked
2012-08-18T02:37:00.000Z	coldpizza72i	MonkeyDust	I dont see how the client is relevent to not even being able to get the server running
2012-08-18T02:37:00.000Z	coldpizza72i		thats all
2012-08-18T02:38:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	coldpizza72i	 and is it a mac with ubuntu or with macos? i'm asking, because i don't know mac, let alone nfs on mac
2012-08-18T02:39:00.000Z	coldpizza72i	MonkeyDust	Im mostly interested in getting the nfs server running... If I have problems mounting it on my macbook Ill goto #MACOSX
2012-08-18T02:40:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	coldpizza72i	 good luck, it sounds like beyond my knowledge
2012-08-18T02:41:00.000Z	coldpizza72i	MonkeyDust	Do you atleast know how I can do post 7 http://forums.fedoraforum.org/showthread.php?t=252180
