2010-04-24T16:41:00.000Z	benste		hi, my FF crashed today - trying to restart it end up with segfault which is similar to https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox-3.5/+bug/505186 - as this bug is discussed in another report - probably private bug report I can't get the information needed to get FF working again - pls help me
2010-04-24T16:41:00.000Z	meowbuntu	benste	run firefox in safe mode
2010-04-24T16:42:00.000Z	benste	meowbuntu	didn't help - even chooising another profile didn't help
2010-04-24T16:42:00.000Z	meowbuntu	benste	reinstall. it will not loose any of you saved addons etc adn it will fix your os
2010-04-24T16:43:00.000Z	benste	meowbuntu	via apt-get remove firefox --purge ?
2010-04-24T16:44:00.000Z	meowbuntu	benste	i never said remove it listen. just install it again dont purge.
2010-04-24T16:45:00.000Z	benste	meowbuntu	apt-get reinstall ?
2010-04-24T16:45:00.000Z	meowbuntu	benste	sudo apt-get remove firefox && sudo apt-get install firefox
2010-04-24T16:45:00.000Z	meowbuntu	benste	that may work
2010-04-24T16:46:00.000Z	benste	meowbuntu	didn't solve the issue - still ending with segfault
2010-04-24T16:47:00.000Z	meowbuntu	benste	so you tryed that -> sudo apt-get remove firefox && sudo apt-get install firefox
2010-04-24T16:47:00.000Z	meowbuntu	benste	ok then do this sudo apt-get purge firefox && sudo apt-get install firefox
2010-04-24T16:50:00.000Z	benste	meowbuntu	still crahsing after purge remove
2010-04-24T16:51:00.000Z	meowbuntu	benste	purge firefox then restart computer then reinstall then restart computer then test
2010-04-24T16:52:00.000Z	benste	meowbuntu	kinda long procedure but i'llhave to try
2010-04-24T16:53:00.000Z	meowbuntu	benste	or you can just install google Chrome or chromium browsers
2010-04-24T16:53:00.000Z	benste	meowbuntu	looks like after sudo apt-get remove firefox --purge
2010-04-24T16:53:00.000Z	benste	meowbuntu	will reboot now
2010-04-24T16:57:00.000Z	benste	meowbuntu	looks like after purging it's still isntalled but running with all old settings
2010-04-24T16:57:00.000Z	benste	meowbuntu	kinda strange that it's working after 2nd restart without reinstalling
2010-04-24T16:57:00.000Z	meowbuntu	benste	sudo apt-get purge firefox
