2005-04-12T15:02:00.000Z	carlos-d-man		hi guys, just installed, GDM login is cute but, I have no root password :S
2005-04-12T15:03:00.000Z	carlos-d-man		I don't recall being asked by the installer for a root password, so what is it? or how may I recover?
2005-04-12T15:03:00.000Z	dabugas	carlos-d-man	you're not supposed to :)
2005-04-12T15:03:00.000Z	dabugas	carlos-d-man	the default install in ubuntu only has users and you sudo for root privileges
2005-04-12T15:04:00.000Z	carlos-d-man	dabugas	no root password?
2005-04-12T15:05:00.000Z	carlos-d-man	dabugas	I will use it for multiuser! I can't allow any moron access to sudo!
2005-04-12T15:06:00.000Z	dabugas	carlos-d-man	check out this http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/RootSudo/ & http://www.ubuntulinux.org/support/documentation/faq/root/
2005-04-12T15:07:00.000Z	dabugas	carlos-d-man	also, if you're going to run a multiuser system and don't know how to introduce a root user simply by using sudo, be prepared :)
2005-04-12T15:11:00.000Z	dabugas	carlos-d-man	honestly, i don't know; i'm not running a multi-user system :)
2005-04-12T15:12:00.000Z	dabugas	carlos-d-man	basically, sudo su and write yerself a password. then create a new user and see if you can sudo, juding by the fledling account my bro made on my computer they shouldn't be able to sudo
2005-04-12T15:12:00.000Z	carlos-d-man	dabugas	ubuntu is desktop central and I like the idea because I am providing desktop to many remote X users but my RAM question is in regards to speed :)
2005-04-12T15:13:00.000Z	dabugas	carlos-d-man	try out what i told you. i'm too bored to try it out myself, but it should work :)
2005-04-12T15:15:00.000Z	carlos-d-man	dabugas	heh sure I will thanks; how may I get pppoe running? Im glad I had knoppix to the rescue ftm hehe
2005-04-12T15:16:00.000Z	dabugas	carlos-d-man	a) you can also get an ubuntu live cd but i haven't tried it b) pppoe? if you're talking about a modem connection try wvdial (for console) and gnome-ppp (for gui) otherwise i've no idea what you are talking about
2005-04-12T15:18:00.000Z	carlos-d-man	dabugas	neather, I mean ADSL with roaring penguin's PPP-over-ethernet, in other distros it's rp-pppoe package :)
2005-04-12T15:19:00.000Z	dabugas	carlos-d-man	i know not of what you seek. go rattle some bones or skin a goat. perhaps the answers will be found there within.
2005-04-12T15:21:00.000Z	carlos-d-man	dabugas	fyi "el chupacabras" means "the goat licker" hehe
2005-04-12T15:21:00.000Z	dabugas	carlos-d-man	chupacabras?
2005-04-12T15:24:00.000Z	carlos-d-man	dabugas	a few years ago the chupacabras made NATIONAL headlines about goats being blood sucked over night, most ignotant morons reported that they believed it must have been a from bat's variation to some sort of alien to blame and the media was just full of it for a few months he
2005-04-12T15:26:00.000Z	dabugas	carlos-d-man	my man, carlos-d. i've no idea what you're talking about :))
2005-04-12T15:29:00.000Z	carlos-d-man	dabugas	just a note on your mention of goats hehe; what if you mount somewhere else and access the drive with gnome and friends through that?
