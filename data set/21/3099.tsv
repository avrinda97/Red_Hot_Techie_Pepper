2009-04-04T10:06:00.000Z	Majishn	him89	I'm actually not running Ubuntu right now. I couldn't get a network connection, so had to do this from Windows. I'll have to come back. Besides pasting the "sudo fdisk -l", anything else?
2009-04-04T10:06:00.000Z	him89		it should not
2009-04-04T10:06:00.000Z	him89	Majishn	type in sudo mount /dev/sdxy /media/disk-4
