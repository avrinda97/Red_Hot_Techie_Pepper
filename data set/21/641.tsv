2011-08-16T18:25:00.000Z	ikonia	Wallace__	yes, it does
2011-08-16T18:26:00.000Z	Wallace__	ikonia	any reason then that I am able to delete files I don't own, with sticky bit set?
2011-08-16T18:26:00.000Z	ikonia	Wallace__	can you show me an example of the permissions ?
2011-08-16T18:27:00.000Z	Wallace__	ikonia	my understanding is that user should not be able to delete the file
2011-08-16T18:29:00.000Z	ikonia	Wallace__	/window 17
2011-08-16T18:29:00.000Z	ikonia	Wallace__	sorry, let me test something, as that doesn't seem right
2011-08-16T18:29:00.000Z	Wallace__	ikonia	http://paste.ubuntu.com/667353/
2011-08-16T18:30:00.000Z	Wallace__	ikonia	yeah, it definitely doesn't seem right to me
2011-08-16T18:33:00.000Z	ikonia	Wallace__	you are the directory owner, so that is why you can delete the files
2011-08-16T18:33:00.000Z	ikonia	Wallace__	(assuming you are doing this test as the user steve)
2011-08-16T18:34:00.000Z	Wallace__	ikonia	I thought you had to be the *file* owner to delete
2011-08-16T18:34:00.000Z	ikonia	Wallace__	according to the man page, the items owner, the directory owner or the super user
2011-08-16T18:34:00.000Z	ikonia	Wallace__	I was a little surprised too
2011-08-16T18:35:00.000Z	ikonia	Wallace__	the sticky bit is set on the directory in your example, so anything under that directory will be effected
2011-08-16T18:36:00.000Z	Wallace__	ikonia	hmm, I want a directory that I can add files to, but not delete from
2011-08-16T18:37:00.000Z	ikonia	Wallace__	let me ponder
2011-08-16T18:40:00.000Z	Wallace__	ikonia	srry, was on phone.  I wonder if I change the directory to root:user it will work
2011-08-16T18:41:00.000Z	Wallace__	ikonia	hmm, that seems to do it
2011-08-16T18:41:00.000Z	ikonia	Wallace__	ahh, nice
2011-08-16T18:41:00.000Z	Wallace__	ikonia	weird....but thanks for your help - I doubt i'd have figured that one out :)
2011-08-16T18:41:00.000Z	ikonia	Wallace__	sorted it on your own, it was interesting
