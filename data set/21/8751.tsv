2006-01-27T10:11:00.000Z	rabbit		is this right?   splashimage=(hd0,4)/grub/splash.xpm.gz
2006-01-27T10:12:00.000Z	rabbit		I've also seen splashimage (hd0,4)/grub/splash.xpm.gz   ..    should there be an '='   sign ????
2006-01-27T10:12:00.000Z	KoruptidPryde	rabbit	compare it to the standard of the rest of the file and follow the standard
2006-01-27T10:13:00.000Z	KoruptidPryde	rabbit	commands in grub all stick to the same standard
2006-01-27T10:13:00.000Z	rabbit	KoruptidPryde	I'm not sure..
2006-01-27T10:13:00.000Z	rabbit	KoruptidPryde	  I have a default install
2006-01-27T10:13:00.000Z	KoruptidPryde	rabbit	have you written the file entirely from scratch?
2006-01-27T10:14:00.000Z	rabbit	KoruptidPryde	  I haven't touched it at all
2006-01-27T10:14:00.000Z	KoruptidPryde	rabbit	okay, then look at the existing commands that are in the file.... such as "root hd(0,0)" and then use your head as to what other commands should look like
2006-01-27T10:15:00.000Z	rabbit	KoruptidPryde	 there's also groot=(hd0,6)
2006-01-27T10:16:00.000Z	KoruptidPryde	rabbit	odd, that shouldn't work at all
2006-01-27T10:16:00.000Z	rabbit	KoruptidPryde	 I didn't do it
2006-01-27T10:16:00.000Z	rabbit	KoruptidPryde	 it was there
2006-01-27T10:16:00.000Z	KoruptidPryde	rabbit	my root commands was wrong   ;)   (hd0,0) not hd(0,0)
2006-01-27T10:17:00.000Z	KoruptidPryde	rabbit	as far as the equal mark goes last time I checked that's bad syntax
2006-01-27T10:17:00.000Z	rabbit	KoruptidPryde	 hrm okay
2006-01-27T10:18:00.000Z	rabbit	KoruptidPryde	 it's in the wiki, see the last section: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/GrubHowto?highlight=%28grub%29
2006-01-27T10:18:00.000Z	KoruptidPryde	rabbit	typo probably
2006-01-27T10:18:00.000Z	rabbit	KoruptidPryde	 well somebody should fix it
2006-01-27T10:18:00.000Z	rabbit	KoruptidPryde	that is if it's wrong
2006-01-27T10:19:00.000Z	KoruptidPryde	rabbit	look at your own grub config file and gleam the knowlege from there
