2008-06-02T02:03:00.000Z	Noxide		should I just "more" that file to see?
2008-06-02T02:03:00.000Z	STSX	Noxide	Sure. :)
2008-06-02T02:03:00.000Z	Noxide	STSX	Should I be in roaming mode? or regular.
2008-06-02T02:04:00.000Z	STSX	Noxide	Don't use roaming mode--connect to a specific AP that is unsecured, and use DHCP for the addressing.
2008-06-02T02:04:00.000Z	Noxide	STSX	I've tried to do that, but I cant choose "Unsecured" so I put in the WPA information, and that does not work.
2008-06-02T02:05:00.000Z	Noxide	STSX	wlan0 IS listed in that file.
2008-06-02T02:05:00.000Z	STSX	Noxide	You're right you can't choose "unsecured", you just have to choose WEP/WPA but leave the password blank. (They really should change that).
2008-06-02T02:06:00.000Z	Noxide	STSX	Should I change my network to unsecured, or just keep putting the WPA information in it.
2008-06-02T02:06:00.000Z	STSX	Noxide	Definitely change it to unsecured for troubleshooting purposes here...
2008-06-02T02:11:00.000Z	Noxide	STSX	I have it set up the way you say and it doesnt even show that its trying to connect to a Wireless network. Also, when I go to the Wireless networks window, no networks come up. :\
2008-06-02T02:12:00.000Z	STSX	Noxide	OK not a good sign obviously... Hang on let me check a few things and maybe we can figure out what's going on...
2008-06-02T02:13:00.000Z	Noxide	STSX	Ok, thank you very much.
2008-06-02T02:15:00.000Z	STSX	Noxide	I forgot to ask and just assumed, but you are on Hardy, correct?
2008-06-02T02:15:00.000Z	Noxide	STSX	Yes hardy.
2008-06-02T02:17:00.000Z	STSX	Noxide	What is the version of your BCM4311 chipset--version 1 or 2? (I think you can find that with "sudo lshw -C network")
2008-06-02T02:19:00.000Z	Noxide	STSX	Rev 1, that command didnt work, but "lspc -v | grep Broadcom" did.
2008-06-02T02:22:00.000Z	STSX	Noxide	Try removing the b43 module and reinstalling it, and then check ifconfig and see if it lists wlan0: "sudo modprobe -r b43" "sudo modprobe b43" and then "ifconfig"
2008-06-02T02:23:00.000Z	Noxide	STSX	It does not list wlan0 now
2008-06-02T02:25:00.000Z	STSX	Noxide	I read in the ubuntu forums of people who have gotten the BCM4311 rev1 to work with the b43 module. But you may have to go with using ndiswrapper--do you have the Windows drivers for your wireless card?
2008-06-02T02:26:00.000Z	Noxide	STSX	Yes i do. but i'm not sure how to use ndiswrapper or what it does. etc
2008-06-02T02:29:00.000Z	STSX	Noxide	OK, unfortunately I have to go now, but I might be back around in an hour or so. The help.ubuntu.com site has a few good tutorials on ndiswrapper, and the only extra thing you may have to add (because of recent changes in Hardy), is given in this thread: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=804989 So anyway, maybe I'll see you around later, otherwise good luck with it. ;)
