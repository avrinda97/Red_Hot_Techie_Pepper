2007-10-19T11:33:00.000Z	chowmeined		why does openoffice.org keep screwing my documents?
2007-10-19T11:33:00.000Z	chowmeined		every time i upgrade.. the new version of openoffice screws up how all my documents are laid out
2007-10-19T11:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	chowmeined	How badly? Can you give an example?
2007-10-19T11:34:00.000Z	chowmeined	Jordan_U_	they are 1 1/2 pages (so uses 2 pages when printing) instead of 1
2007-10-19T11:34:00.000Z	chowmeined	Jordan_U_	and some of them are wrapped way over, when before they fit fine on the page
2007-10-19T11:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	chowmeined	If you want them to be exactly the same then you shouldn't use a document format, you should use a digital paper format like PDF
2007-10-19T11:35:00.000Z	chowmeined	Jordan_U_	but i was working on it...
2007-10-19T11:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	chowmeined	What do you mean?
2007-10-19T11:35:00.000Z	chowmeined	Jordan_U_	i was writing my paper, then i upgraded
2007-10-19T11:36:00.000Z	chowmeined	Jordan_U_	now i have to reformat it
2007-10-19T11:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	chowmeined	It's not like it added or removed formatting, it is just using more space
2007-10-19T11:36:00.000Z	chowmeined	Jordan_U_	so i have to resize a bunch of stuff
2007-10-19T11:37:00.000Z	chowmeined	Jordan_U_	oh well...
2007-10-19T11:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	chowmeined	You can usually format things so that even adding / removing text wont completely ruin the format
2007-10-19T11:39:00.000Z	chowmeined	Jordan_U_	it just seems all the stuff is bigger and flows off of the areas i wanted it now
2007-10-19T11:39:00.000Z	chowmeined	Jordan_U_	but its not uniformly bigger, so i have to selectively resize certain components
2007-10-19T11:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	chowmeined	But you shouldn't have to resize anything, I guess I just can't see how there would be a problem unless you are doing things like ( though this is an exaggeration ) using tabs to center text rather than setting it to be centered
2007-10-19T11:41:00.000Z	chowmeined	Jordan_U_	i wanted certain things to all fit on one page
2007-10-19T11:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	chowmeined	Ah, I see, then document formats aren't really made for that. The same will happen with different versions of Word
2007-10-19T11:42:00.000Z	chowmeined	Jordan_U_	ok
