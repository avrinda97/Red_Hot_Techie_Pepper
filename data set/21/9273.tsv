2006-06-02T11:10:00.000Z	mustard5	TokenBad	I might have an idea
2006-06-02T11:10:00.000Z	TokenBad	mustard5	yes..please?
2006-06-02T11:11:00.000Z	mustard5	TokenBad	did it seem to just start randomly?

2006-06-02T11:11:00.000Z	mustard5	TokenBad	I'm just trying to recall which files I deleted
2006-06-02T11:11:00.000Z	mustard5	TokenBad	there are a couple of bin files /var/cache/apt/ I think
2006-06-02T11:12:00.000Z	mustard5	TokenBad	I would have to check them out again before I was sure
2006-06-02T11:12:00.000Z	mustard5	TokenBad	and I'm on Puppy linux atm..not ubuntu
2006-06-02T11:12:00.000Z	TokenBad		pkgcache.bin?
2006-06-02T11:12:00.000Z	mustard5	TokenBad	there should be two files?
2006-06-02T11:12:00.000Z	TokenBad		srcpkgcache.bin?
2006-06-02T11:13:00.000Z	mustard5	TokenBad	yeah..just move them if you want to be cautious
2006-06-02T11:13:00.000Z	mustard5	TokenBad	move them out of that directory
2006-06-02T11:14:00.000Z	TokenBad	mustard5	trying now
2006-06-02T11:14:00.000Z	mustard5	TokenBad	at least if you just move them you can move them back ;)
2006-06-02T11:14:00.000Z	mustard5	TokenBad	that fixed a seg faulting error I had in the past
2006-06-02T11:14:00.000Z	TokenBad	mustard5	it worked...thanks alot!!!
2006-06-02T11:15:00.000Z	mustard5	TokenBad	I'm glad :)
2006-06-02T11:15:00.000Z	mustard5	TokenBad	took me ages to find that solution when I had it..and I had already reinstalled when I found it
