2009-02-06T09:07:00.000Z	josesito		is there any way to send a message using xmessage to a logged user on a remote pc via ssh? (the ssh user is root and the logged user there is "user" using gnome)
2009-02-06T09:09:00.000Z	scunizi	josesito	yes.. but for the life of me I can't remember. should be the same as sending a message to another machine on a lan..
2009-02-06T09:10:00.000Z	josesito	scunizi	and how do you do that?

2009-02-06T09:12:00.000Z	josesito	scunizi	i guess that's using wall, but the user isn't using any terminal
2009-02-06T09:12:00.000Z	scunizi	josesito	sorry I'm not well versed in this.. google was my friend there.
2009-02-06T09:12:00.000Z	josesito	scunizi	:D thanks anyway
2009-02-06T09:13:00.000Z	scunizi	josesito	np.. It's cool to do things like that when there's a need.. might shock the other person as well..
2009-02-06T09:20:00.000Z	scunizi	josesito	did you figure it out?
2009-02-06T09:20:00.000Z	josesito	scunizi	the window size? or the message?
2009-02-06T09:20:00.000Z	scunizi	josesito	message
2009-02-06T09:20:00.000Z	josesito	scunizi	yeah
2009-02-06T09:21:00.000Z	scunizi	josesito	how do you do it.. also is it from one linux machine to another or can it also be done from linux to win?
2009-02-06T09:21:00.000Z	josesito	scunizi	su user, then DISPLAY=:0 xmessage "Hullo world"
2009-02-06T09:22:00.000Z	scunizi	josesito	while connected to the other machine via ssh?
2009-02-06T09:22:00.000Z	josesito	scunizi	that will only work from linux to linux since it usses xmessage. but i think you can also send winpopup messages to win machines
2009-02-06T09:22:00.000Z	josesito	scunizi	yup
2009-02-06T09:22:00.000Z	scunizi	josesito	nice.. thanks..
2009-02-06T09:24:00.000Z	josesito	scunizi	to windows use samba and do smbclient -M NetBIOS name and you'll be in a chat-like mode where you can actually chat
2009-02-06T09:24:00.000Z	scunizi	josesito	interesting..
2009-02-06T09:24:00.000Z	josesito	scunizi	oh, that works if the server computer is running winpopup
