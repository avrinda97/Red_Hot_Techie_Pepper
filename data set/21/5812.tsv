2007-08-13T08:25:00.000Z	Tonren		Guys, I have a 3com Etherlink III adapter and when I do 'sudo modprobe 3c509', the pc link light on my router doesn't turn on.  Also, I'm getting a 169.* IP address as though this were a Windows private IP thing.  What's happening??
2007-08-13T08:26:00.000Z	palintheus	Tonren	so a router is between you and the internet?
2007-08-13T08:28:00.000Z	palintheus		or notepad++
2007-08-13T08:35:00.000Z	Tonren	palintheus	Yeah, there was a router
2007-08-13T08:36:00.000Z	Tonren	palintheus	But dhclient eth0 didn't detect a DHCP server
2007-08-13T08:36:00.000Z	palintheus		well, you will get a private IP from a router
2007-08-13T08:36:00.000Z	Tonren	palintheus	I don't understand... the router has DHCP running, and the PC link light isn't glowing.
2007-08-13T08:36:00.000Z	palintheus	Tonren	wifi or lan?
2007-08-13T08:36:00.000Z	Tonren	palintheus	LAN
2007-08-13T08:36:00.000Z	Tonren	palintheus	I'm using a 3com 3c509 NIC.  It's from 1994.
2007-08-13T08:37:00.000Z	palintheus	Tonren	did you have it plugged in when you powered on the machine?
2007-08-13T08:37:00.000Z	Tonren	palintheus	"sudo modprobe 3c509" is supposed to make the PC link light show up, but it's not.
2007-08-13T08:37:00.000Z	Tonren	palintheus	Yes.
2007-08-13T08:37:00.000Z	Tonren	palintheus	I've read some terrifying things about downloading a DOS configuration utility to change the IRQ options of the NIC.
2007-08-13T08:38:00.000Z	palintheus	Tonren	 when you left click on the network manger icon near the clock is 'wired' and option
2007-08-13T08:38:00.000Z	Tonren	palintheus	I'm on the command line.

2007-08-13T08:39:00.000Z	palintheus	Tonren	ahh, well I'm not up on my terminal only info sorry...
2007-08-13T08:39:00.000Z	palintheus	Tonren	have you tried the forums?
2007-08-13T08:39:00.000Z	Tonren	palintheus	Yep.  I've been Googling and forum-searching for almost 2 hours
2007-08-13T08:40:00.000Z	palintheus	Tonren	you may just make a new post and wait a day or two if you can and no one else here can help, sorry I couldn't help more
