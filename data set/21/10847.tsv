2004-11-04T09:27:00.000Z	maswan		yeah
2004-11-04T09:27:00.000Z	maswan		but that's up to the reciever to figure out if [s] he wants to redistribute or do something else forbidden by copyright law.
2004-11-04T09:27:00.000Z	maswan		just for using it, having recieved it is good enough.
2004-11-04T09:28:00.000Z	brettcar	maswan	Receiving it legally however.
2004-11-04T09:28:00.000Z	brettcar	maswan	I don't think you have legal standing to use it if received against the terms of the GPL. 
2004-11-04T09:28:00.000Z	brettcar	maswan	But that is for a judge to decide. I believe you may have the right to use it but then distributer will be at fault.
2004-11-04T09:31:00.000Z	maswan	brettcar	well, that depends really..
2004-11-04T09:32:00.000Z	maswan	brettcar	we do have some fudge factors about it being resonable assumption of it being redistributed in that way etc.
2004-11-04T09:36:00.000Z	maswan	brettcar	well, you do have to display copyright statements. that
2004-11-04T09:36:00.000Z	brettcar	maswan	Yeah but that isn't the same as a "clickwrap" awaregreement. :)
2004-11-04T09:42:00.000Z	maswan	brettcar	ehm. basically non-existant.
2004-11-04T09:42:00.000Z	maswan	brettcar	that is, redistribution is probably not allowed if looking at it strictly.
2004-11-04T09:43:00.000Z	brettcar	maswan	Yes but if you wget'd from the actual official distribution place it could be potentially legal.
2004-11-04T09:43:00.000Z	maswan	brettcar	heh. you want to know what w32codecs is? :)
2004-11-04T09:43:00.000Z	brettcar	maswan	Of course if the actual code is "illegal" (like our favourite DVD encryption method...) its another story
2004-11-04T09:44:00.000Z	brettcar	maswan	Yeah I have a vague idea. See previous message.
2004-11-04T09:44:00.000Z	brettcar	maswan	I know what the package does but I don't know its legal implications.
2004-11-04T09:44:00.000Z	maswan	brettcar	it is dlls etc ripped out of mixed "freely" available installers for various windows codecs.
2004-11-04T09:44:00.000Z	maswan	brettcar	ah, no, dvd decryption is in mplayer proper. no need for w32codecs for that
2004-11-04T09:47:00.000Z	maswan	brettcar	and that is in the redistributable main mplayer, w32codecs is the problematic part. ;)
2004-11-04T09:47:00.000Z	brettcar	maswan	Right, this I know
