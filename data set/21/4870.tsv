2008-11-04T09:22:00.000Z	raDeon		how do i fix Unknown id: apt-get when i use "su" instead of "sudo"
2008-11-04T09:23:00.000Z	rww	raDeon	what exactly are you typing at the command line?
2008-11-04T09:23:00.000Z	raDeon	rww	"su apt-get update"
2008-11-04T09:23:00.000Z	raDeon		it does the same thing any time i use "su" in place of "sudo"
2008-11-04T09:23:00.000Z	rww	raDeon	try su -c "apt-get update"
2008-11-04T09:24:00.000Z	raDeon	rww	su: Authentication failure
2008-11-04T09:24:00.000Z	raDeon		even with the right password
2008-11-04T09:24:00.000Z	rww	raDeon	do you have the root account enabled?
2008-11-04T09:24:00.000Z	raDeon		i used to always use su
2008-11-04T09:24:00.000Z	raDeon		sudo is too much to type
2008-11-04T09:24:00.000Z	raDeon		and i dont know if i have root account enabled
2008-11-04T09:24:00.000Z	rww	raDeon	I note that "sudo" is shorter than "su -c"
2008-11-04T09:25:00.000Z	rww	raDeon	it's not enabled by default, so you probably don't.
2008-11-04T09:25:00.000Z	raDeon		i always did "su command" in the past
2008-11-04T09:25:00.000Z	raDeon		now i do "sudo command"
2008-11-04T09:25:00.000Z	raDeon		this is a fresh install of 8.10 and it's like that
2008-11-04T09:25:00.000Z	rww	raDeon	considering that "su command" has never been valid syntax, I don't think you did =/
2008-11-04T09:25:00.000Z	raDeon		you're calling me a liar
2008-11-04T09:25:00.000Z	raDeon		that's how i always used it "su command"
2008-11-04T09:26:00.000Z	rww	raDeon	if you're concerned about the length of "sudo", try putting something like "alias s = 'sudo'" in your .bashrc
2008-11-04T09:26:00.000Z	rww	raDeon	and yes, since I have man su on my side, I'm saying "su command" doesn't work.
