2010-03-23T23:04:00.000Z	llutz	CartoonCat	there are some "force" options for dpkg (man dpkg), maybe they help. but it's always dangerous...
2010-03-23T23:04:00.000Z	CartoonCat		at this point idgaf lol, this is anoying
2010-03-23T23:04:00.000Z	CartoonCat		and i did try aptgets force, same issue
2010-03-23T23:05:00.000Z	llutz	CartoonCat	can you manually download that .deb and reinstall it with dpkg?
2010-03-23T23:05:00.000Z	llutz	CartoonCat	or take it from /var/cache/apt/archives
2010-03-23T23:06:00.000Z	CartoonCat	llutz	i HAVE that .deb, the probelm is the .deb is call ed one thing, while apt calls it something else (yes, it is the smae one cause in aptitude it has the svn version correct)
