2011-04-04T12:10:00.000Z	introuble		Hello?
2011-04-04T12:10:00.000Z	introuble		Sorry, I'm so desperate. Is anybody willing to help me? It's urgent
2011-04-04T12:12:00.000Z	introuble		My netbook keeps booting to a shell. It says it can't mount sys nor dev nor another thing. When I try to safely reboot with reisub, it goes into kernel panic!
2011-04-04T12:12:00.000Z	introuble		Please, somebody help me.
2011-04-04T12:13:00.000Z	introuble		I would be so grateful.
2011-04-04T12:14:00.000Z	introuble		Can anyone help me? It won't load my operating system, I don't know how to fix it on my own.
2011-04-04T12:14:00.000Z	ruan	introuble	run a fsck on the drive, it seems to not be able to mount
2011-04-04T12:15:00.000Z	ruan	introuble	you could do online backup
2011-04-04T12:15:00.000Z	ruan	introuble	i use mediafire
2011-04-04T12:16:00.000Z	ruan	introuble	it's free
2011-04-04T12:20:00.000Z	ruan	introuble	when you boot, can you boot in recovery mode?
2011-04-04T12:21:00.000Z	ruan	introuble	yes
2011-04-04T12:21:00.000Z	ruan	introuble	shell
2011-04-04T12:21:00.000Z	ruan	introuble	well, i mean ubuntu recovery mode
2011-04-04T12:22:00.000Z	ruan	introuble	ok, that too
2011-04-04T12:23:00.000Z	ruan	introuble	startx
2011-04-04T12:23:00.000Z	ruan	introuble	what type of shell is it though
2011-04-04T12:23:00.000Z	ruan	introuble	is it a shell you can login to?
2011-04-04T12:23:00.000Z	introuble	ruan	Not that I know of. But I'm not familiar enough with bash
2011-04-04T12:27:00.000Z	ruan	introuble	the recovery mode should ask to login
2011-04-04T12:36:00.000Z	introuble	ruan	It was pretty easy, too. Thank GOD you guys were here.
