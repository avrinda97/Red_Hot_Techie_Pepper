2009-05-11T20:59:00.000Z	tonytraductor		I wrote my own ftp client in tcl/tk, tclup, info here: http://www.baldwinlinguas.com
2009-05-11T20:59:00.000Z	tonytraductor		of course, it lacks a lot of the gui features of gftp
2009-05-11T20:59:00.000Z	tonytraductor		but it works for me
2009-05-11T21:00:00.000Z	tonytraductor		I also incorporated ftp functions in the text editor I wrote, TclText (http://freshmeat.net/projects/tickletext/)
2009-05-11T21:00:00.000Z	tonytraductor		that way I can edit my webpages in the text editor and up/download them from my servers, and stuff like that
2009-05-11T21:01:00.000Z	tonytraductor		it's a pretty good text editor
2009-05-11T21:01:00.000Z	Yanick_	tonytraductor	there is no ftp client on that page
2009-05-11T21:02:00.000Z	Yanick_	tonytraductor	hehe

2009-05-11T21:13:00.000Z	Yanick_	tonytraductor	using synaptic...
2009-05-11T21:14:00.000Z	Yanick_	tonytraductor	you should have added all the required packages in the README
2009-05-11T21:14:00.000Z	Yanick_	tonytraductor	needs package Img too
2009-05-11T21:15:00.000Z	Yanick_	tonytraductor	well, I can't start it because it says : "Error in startup script: can't find package Img"
