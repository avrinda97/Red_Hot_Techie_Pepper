2011-12-14T16:32:00.000Z	almoxarife	funkymonk	you want into a machine, can you 'ping' said machine and get a response?
2011-12-14T16:33:00.000Z	funkymonk	almoxarife	no i cant ping it
2011-12-14T16:34:00.000Z	almoxarife	funkymonk	is it firewalled?
2011-12-14T16:34:00.000Z	funkymonk	almoxarife	yes
2011-12-14T16:36:00.000Z	almoxarife	funkymonk	so, you want to ssh session with a machine that is firewalled?
2011-12-14T16:37:00.000Z	funkymonk	almoxarife	not only ssh
2011-12-14T16:38:00.000Z	almoxarife	funkymonk	can you ping the server?
2011-12-14T16:40:00.000Z	funkymonk	almoxarife	 strangely i'm getting a response back which i wasn't not even 15 mins ago
2011-12-14T16:40:00.000Z	almoxarife	funkymonk	you can access the webpage because you are going into it via the public address
2011-12-14T16:40:00.000Z	funkymonk	almoxarife	I can access the website and ssh if i use the public address
2011-12-14T16:42:00.000Z	almoxarife	funkymonk	does your router disallow internal/lan ip's to connect? you obviously can connect via the public ip for the server, so its got to be an internal thing
2011-12-14T16:43:00.000Z	funkymonk	almoxarife	 let me check the mac controls brb
2011-12-14T16:46:00.000Z	funkymonk	almoxarife	 I cant see anything that would suggest that my router is blocking it
2011-12-14T16:47:00.000Z	almoxarife	funkymonk	you said you ran zenmap, did it see the web/ubuntu-server?
2011-12-14T16:48:00.000Z	almoxarife	funkymonk	if you are going to discount the router then you need to allow all and any contact within the network to take place
2011-12-14T16:51:00.000Z	funkymonk	almoxarife	i tried with it set to allow and still nothing
2011-12-14T16:53:00.000Z	funkymonk	almoxarife	if i use nmap -Pn 192.168.123.123 it says Starting Nmap 5.51 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2011-12-14 11:52 GMT Standard Time Nmap done: 1 IP address (0 hosts up) scanned in 0.74 seconds
2011-12-14T16:55:00.000Z	almoxarife	funkymonk	run nmap on your public ip, see what is open to the world
2011-12-14T16:58:00.000Z	funkymonk	almoxarife	port 2120 is not displayed even though I can access it. port 80 is displayed
2011-12-14T17:16:00.000Z	funkymonk	almoxarife	hmm appears that ubuntu server is blocking local requests I turned off its firewall and it connects using lan ip address
2011-12-14T17:17:00.000Z	almoxarife	funkymonk	yeap, firewall
