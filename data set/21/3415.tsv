2009-01-06T06:07:00.000Z	laderius		What can i do to enable hidden devices in proprietary drivers? my video card isnt there, or is there a way to see the video driver im currently using?
2009-01-06T06:07:00.000Z	jrib	laderius	what card?
2009-01-06T06:08:00.000Z	laderius	jrib	8800 gts
2009-01-06T06:09:00.000Z	jrib	laderius	what version of ubuntu?
2009-01-06T06:09:00.000Z	laderius	jrib	8.04 also my reltrek sound sint working
2009-01-06T06:10:00.000Z	jrib	laderius	8.04 might be too old for that card.  Did you check if nvidia-glx-new supports it?
2009-01-06T06:12:00.000Z	jrib	laderius	read the package description to check.  Did the Alternate install cd also fail?
2009-01-06T06:13:00.000Z	laderius	jrib	yes it failed aswell, i have a sata drive, is there a way to upgrade thru ubuntu already...
2009-01-06T06:13:00.000Z	jrib	laderius	yes, you can upgrade.  How did the install fail exactly?
2009-01-06T06:14:00.000Z	laderius	jrib	at first it all seemed fine on normal and alternitve and when it went to reboot it would drop to a shell as soon as the normal login screen would have came up
2009-01-06T06:14:00.000Z	jrib	laderius	so you could login normally then?
2009-01-06T06:15:00.000Z	jrib	laderius	could you log in with the text login you got?
2009-01-06T06:15:00.000Z	laderius	jrib	it would just drop to shell
2009-01-06T06:15:00.000Z	jrib	laderius	busybox?
2009-01-06T06:15:00.000Z	laderius	jrib	yes
2009-01-06T06:17:00.000Z	laderius	jrib	my card is supported under that package, how would i install it? also, how would i configure my audio device
2009-01-06T06:17:00.000Z	laderius	jrib	or do you think attemping to upgeade woule be a better idea
2009-01-06T06:17:00.000Z	jrib	laderius	sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-new, or use synaptic like any other package
2009-01-06T06:17:00.000Z	jrib	laderius	up to you
2009-01-06T06:21:00.000Z	laderius	jrib	im trying the upgrade to see if my devices will be native
2009-01-06T06:21:00.000Z	jrib	laderius	ok
