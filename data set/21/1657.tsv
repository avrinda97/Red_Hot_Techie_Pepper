2010-06-10T09:51:00.000Z	kathe	Gothicsatan	you don't really burn those to a memory stick like a cd, memory sticks are a different medium, you can emulate a cd by mounting an io image from any source including the usb
2010-06-10T09:51:00.000Z	kathe	Gothicsatan	or you can uncompress the image and copy the fiels over, but a lot of DRM won't like it depending on the game
2010-06-10T09:51:00.000Z	Gothicsatan	kathe	it's so i can give the stick to someone else and they plug it in, and it reacts like it was an inserted disc
