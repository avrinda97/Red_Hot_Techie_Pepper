2009-06-06T08:01:00.000Z	Firefishe		I'm using the kubuntu 9.04 live cd.  I just installed the nvidia proprietary driver, and the system wants a reboot to activate it.  Is there any way around this?

2009-06-06T08:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Firefishe	the graphics card driver shoudn't be installed on the Live CD, since you  need to reboot really, unless you can just log out and back in again
2009-06-06T08:02:00.000Z	Firefishe	sebsebseb	 log out and back in on a live cd?
2009-06-06T08:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Firefishe	maybe possible somehow
2009-06-06T08:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Firefishe	I think I have seen log in screen on Ubuntu Live CD's before
2009-11-18T07:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Firefishe	well there's a way in Wine
2009-11-18T07:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Firefishe	yeah got to use a Windows browser as well or something,  I remember reading something in the past
2010-06-29T03:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Firefishe	well sure Launchpad I guess
2010-06-29T03:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Firefishe	unless you know their IRC nicks,  but they probably won't want to just be pm'd by anyone
2010-06-29T03:51:00.000Z	Firefishe	sebsebseb	What is Software Centre?  Experimental package manager?
2010-06-29T03:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Firefishe	no

2010-06-29T03:52:00.000Z	Firefishe	sebsebseb	Fishscene: What's the actual command to invoke it via CLI?

2010-06-29T03:54:00.000Z	Firefishe	sebsebseb	Every application has to reside somewhere, usually in /usr/sbin, /usr/bin, somewhere.
2010-06-29T03:54:00.000Z	Firefishe	sebsebseb	Incidentally, are we talking kde?
