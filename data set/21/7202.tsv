2006-11-12T08:18:00.000Z	topyli	bobbby	sorry? how do you set what?
2006-11-12T08:18:00.000Z	bobbby	topyli	the "xorg,conf" thing
2006-11-12T08:18:00.000Z	bobbby	topyli	the "xorg.conf" thing*
2006-11-12T08:19:00.000Z	topyli	bobbby	ah, just edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf with any text editor and change the "ati" driver to "radeon" in the Device section
2006-11-12T08:19:00.000Z	topyli	bobbby	after making a backup of the file of course :)
2006-11-12T08:23:00.000Z	bobbby	topyli	ok but how in hell i do that, while starting the live session it says the x window colund start and then crashes....
2006-11-12T08:23:00.000Z	bobbby	topyli	:(
2006-11-12T08:24:00.000Z	topyli	bobbby	ah a live cd. no, you don't edit those :)
2006-11-12T08:24:00.000Z	bobbby	topyli	:S
2006-11-12T08:25:00.000Z	topyli	bobbby	listen to LjL, he seems to have a better idea
2006-11-12T08:26:00.000Z	topyli	bobbby	if he's right you can edit the file like it's a real one. use nano as your editor if you have no X
2006-11-12T08:28:00.000Z	bobbby	topyli	ok, but still dont know how to do it
2006-11-12T08:29:00.000Z	topyli	bobbby	"sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf". but i don't know how much it will help on a live system
2006-11-12T08:29:00.000Z	topyli	bobbby	might be better to run the "vesa" driver as it's supposed to always work
2006-11-12T08:30:00.000Z	bobbby	topyli	how do i run the "vesa" driver :S:S::S
2006-11-12T08:31:00.000Z	topyli	bobbby	edit the file, find the Device section and change the lilne that says "Driver = "ati"" or similar to say "vesa"
2006-11-12T08:32:00.000Z	topyli	bobbby	then do "startx" and see whether it starts or blows up :)
2006-11-12T08:34:00.000Z	bobbby	topyli	mmm.. but in the live cd theres i sno console so i can do that, the just a "boot options" line and no more, afeter that just crashed cuz the x
2006-11-12T08:35:00.000Z	topyli	bobbby	maybe there are more consoles if you press ctrl-alt-F2
2006-11-12T08:36:00.000Z	bobbby	topyli	weel ill try,brb
