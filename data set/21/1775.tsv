2010-05-02T09:34:00.000Z	jeff1010_		wow this is horrible lagging
2010-05-02T09:35:00.000Z	jeff1010_		how can i take a screenshot of t?
2010-05-02T09:37:00.000Z	jeff1010_		actually gnome greys out my windows, typing doesnt register and i cant take a screenshot.. meh i'm going to go back to windows 7 as much as i dont like that
2010-05-02T09:39:00.000Z	jeff1010_		..while i am doing a large 10gb or so copy from one partition to another on the same disk
2010-05-02T09:40:00.000Z	jeff1010_		see.. it locks up and i can only get 1 message per 2 or so minutes into this channel
2010-05-02T09:40:00.000Z	hypetech	jeff1010_	maybe it's a bad disk
2010-05-02T09:42:00.000Z	jeff1010_	hypetech	the laptop is 2 months old and I've had no problems until an hour ago, no bad disk errors in the logs
2010-05-02T09:42:00.000Z	jeff1010_		i'm thinking something is up with the new 32nm i3/i5 intels, they have funky cpu scaling/integrated GPU
2010-05-02T09:43:00.000Z	hypetech	jeff1010_	I've copied a few hundred gigs from partitions, shares, and devices since I installed this yesterday without any issue so far, I don't think it's ubuntu specific
2010-05-02T09:43:00.000Z	jeff1010_	hypetech	it could be fs-related, are you using ext4?
2010-05-02T09:43:00.000Z	hypetech	jeff1010_	yes
2010-05-02T09:44:00.000Z	jeff1010_	hypetech	do you have a 32nm i3/i5?
2010-05-02T09:44:00.000Z	hypetech	jeff1010_	my ubuntu install itself is on a single partition though, I didn't make a seperate partition for /home
2010-05-02T09:44:00.000Z	hypetech	jeff1010_	no, mobile pentium
2010-05-02T09:45:00.000Z	jeff1010_	hypetech	hmm.. well my copying is done and now it's not locking up. so that triggered the problem hmm
2010-05-02T09:46:00.000Z	jeff1010_		hmm
2010-05-02T09:47:00.000Z	hypetech	jeff1010_	were you running torrents or anything else that would have had heavy disk i/o?
2010-05-02T09:47:00.000Z	jeff1010_	hypetech	no.. i basically just installed it and had nothing else running.
2010-05-02T09:47:00.000Z	hypetech	jeff1010_	strang
2010-05-02T09:47:00.000Z	hypetech		e
2010-05-02T09:48:00.000Z	jeff1010_	hypetech	i'm doing tests on the fs now to see if it's disk related or perhaps ntfs/ext4 related
