2006-01-28T16:36:00.000Z	ccidral		hi all...
2006-01-28T16:36:00.000Z	ccidral		I want the latest version of the Kernel with support for both Pentium 4 and SMP ...
2006-01-28T16:37:00.000Z	ccidral		is there a way to upgrade the kernel from the web without having to compile it myself?
2006-01-28T16:38:00.000Z	theine	ccidral	chances are you will have to compile it. Why do you need the latest version so badly?
2006-01-28T16:38:00.000Z	theine	ccidral	oh...
2006-01-28T16:39:00.000Z	theine	ccidral	you should automatically get it when you update your system
2006-01-28T16:39:00.000Z	theine	ccidral	one second...
2006-01-28T16:39:00.000Z	ccidral	theine	but I would like to have support for Pentium 4 and SMP
2006-01-28T16:40:00.000Z	theine	ccidral	sudo apt-get install linux-686-smp
2006-01-28T16:42:00.000Z	theine	ccidral	you're welcome
2006-01-28T16:44:00.000Z	ccidral	theine	where have you found it out?
2006-01-28T16:45:00.000Z	theine	ccidral	I did "apt-cache search linux | grep 686 | grep smp"...
2006-01-28T16:46:00.000Z	theine	ccidral	but I actually knew that such a kernel version is available. can't remember when I first heard about it though...
2006-01-28T16:50:00.000Z	ccidral	theine	I knew that Debian had such a version in its online package list, but I have not found an online package list at Ubuntu web site.
2006-01-28T16:50:00.000Z	theine	ccidral	http://packages.ubuntu.com
2006-01-28T16:51:00.000Z	ccidral	theine	thanks ... packages.debian.org ... it should be pretty predictable huh? :)
2006-01-28T16:52:00.000Z	theine	ccidral	:)
2006-01-28T16:53:00.000Z	ccidral	theine	apt-cache search is more straightforeward
2006-01-28T16:53:00.000Z	theine	ccidral	but very verbose sometimes...
2006-01-28T16:54:00.000Z	theine	ccidral	also, http://packages.ubuntu.com offers you to search the contents of packages which is really useful imho
2006-01-28T16:55:00.000Z	ccidral	theine	I'll check it
