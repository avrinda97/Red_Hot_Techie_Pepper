2008-05-15T19:40:00.000Z	fent		I noticed my computer rebooted at during the night. I didn't reboot it, and no one has any legitimate access to the machine. Is there any possibility this doesnt indicate a compromise? (recent ssh vuln makes me believe this scenario isnt unlikely)
2008-05-15T19:42:00.000Z	fent		I don't see anything suspicious in the .bash_history.
2008-05-15T19:42:00.000Z	bazhang	fent	they still on your machine? type who in terminal to see
2008-05-15T19:43:00.000Z	fent	bazhang	nope, only me, I assume they rebooted to cover their tracks
2008-05-15T19:43:00.000Z	fent	bazhang	so, this really must mean someone else was on the machine right? I don't know anything that can restart your machine without user intervention
2008-05-15T19:44:00.000Z	bazhang	fent	unless it was scheduled by you; who else had access to the machine and knew your pass
2008-05-15T19:54:00.000Z	fent	bazhang	no one else has access. I looked through auth.log, and syslog. I don't see anything obviously wrong :-/.
2008-05-15T19:55:00.000Z	bazhang	fent	when did you see it restarted? could it have been a power spike?
2008-05-15T19:56:00.000Z	fent	bazhang	this morning, could a power spike have triggered a soft restart? The OS detect the power spike the restart on its own, or is that not likely?
2008-05-15T19:57:00.000Z	bazhang	fent	just trying to cover all possibilities
2008-05-15T19:58:00.000Z	fent	bazhang	yep thanks. I'm not sure what the appropriate response is here... reinstall OS? What steps can i take to check whether there was really a compromise (or is the restart itself enough evidence?)
2008-05-15T20:00:00.000Z	bazhang	fent	that seems over much; do you use ssh-server?
2008-05-15T20:00:00.000Z	fent	bazhang	yep, and i had it unpached for about 8 hours on Tuesday
2008-05-15T20:00:00.000Z	bazhang	fent	well get the updates, generate some new keys first off
2008-05-15T20:01:00.000Z	fent	bazhang	done and done =)
2008-05-15T20:11:00.000Z	fent	bazhang	: ok, i think i may have jumped the gun. It was actually gdm that restarted (potentially crashed?), the machine did /not/ reboot. The restart I was looking at the syslogd daemon restarting =)
2008-05-15T20:12:00.000Z	bazhang	fent	ah that is good news; best to get new keys and update though right?
2008-05-15T20:19:00.000Z	fent	bazhang	thanks for your help. time to relax a bit after this mild heart attack
2008-07-06T14:40:00.000Z	bazhang	fent	what do you need to do
2008-07-06T14:41:00.000Z	bazhang	fent	#ubuntu+1 for 8.10
2008-07-06T14:43:00.000Z	bazhang	fent	then go to ##windows
