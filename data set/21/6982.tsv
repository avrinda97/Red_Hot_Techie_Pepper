2008-06-13T04:39:00.000Z	ecn_art		ergh... when i try to execute qparted gives folowing error: could not execute child process qparted: no such file or directory ( i just installed it now)
2008-06-13T04:40:00.000Z	ecn_art		i just installed it from synaptic
2008-06-13T04:40:00.000Z	ecn_art		yes
2008-06-13T04:41:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ecn_art	what programs are you having problems starting?
2008-06-13T04:44:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ecn_art	are you using gnome or kde?
2008-06-13T04:46:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ecn_art	do you have a "K" menu, or do you have an "Application, Places, System" menu on your desktop
2008-06-13T04:47:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ecn_art	ok, you're using gnome.
2008-06-13T04:47:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ecn_art	have you tried running gparted?.. its the p artition editor for gnome.
2008-06-13T04:48:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ecn_art	Qparted and Gparted are different
2008-06-13T04:49:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ecn_art	i know that..
2008-06-13T04:50:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ecn_art	open a terminal, and type "qtparted" w/o quotes, and see if it gives you any errors.
2008-06-13T04:51:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ecn_art	no prob, but tis silly to run qtparted.. thats really a KDE app,b ut as long as it does what you want
2008-06-13T04:57:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ecn_art	swap should generally be 1.5-2x your memory
2008-06-13T04:58:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ecn_art	6gigs would be al ittle overkill
2008-06-13T04:58:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ecn_art	1.5-2x your system ram, is just a general rule.. you'll be fine w/ 1-2gigs
2008-06-13T05:00:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ecn_art	good luck, just make sure your stuff is backed up.. that sounds like it will be a task
2008-06-13T05:11:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ecn_art	you need to use a live CD most likely
2008-06-13T05:11:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ecn_art	you can't resize a partition you're actively using... common sense there.
2008-06-13T05:12:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ecn_art	google the partedmagic live CD.. its easy to use, a quick download, burn it to CD, and use it.. its great.
2008-06-13T05:13:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ecn_art	qtparted isn't.. but i think the live CD has gparted.. which should work
2008-06-13T05:45:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ecn_art	i would guess you could.. but i don't know for sure.
