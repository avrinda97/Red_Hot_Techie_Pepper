2010-04-30T06:21:00.000Z	rww	collier_s	"/pub" is either unnecessary or wrong, apart from that it's fine
2010-04-30T06:22:00.000Z	collier_s	rww	chelz still getting a failure to fetch files
2010-04-30T06:23:00.000Z	rww	collier_s	us.archive.ubuntu.com is likely under heavy load right now. try replacing "us.archive.ubuntu.com" with "ubuntu.osuosl.org", see if that works.
2010-04-30T06:23:00.000Z	collier_s	rww	ok

2010-04-30T06:27:00.000Z	rww	collier_s	I joined the channel in the middle of your problem. Are you attempting to upgrade to Lucid, or do you already have Lucid installed and are having problems getting updates?
2010-04-30T06:27:00.000Z	collier_s	rww	attempting to upgrade
2010-04-30T06:28:00.000Z	rww	collier_s	use the official instructions instead of editing sources.list
2010-04-30T06:29:00.000Z	collier_s	rww	you missed that part of troubleshooting, i've update manager, and the upgrade button is greyed out

2010-04-30T06:30:00.000Z	collier_s	rww	i was trying to add another mirror at the suggestion of another helper in here.. becuase this is a dell mini 10 and we thought i didn't have the correct mirrors
2010-04-30T06:31:00.000Z	rww	collier_s	Have you tried the command-line instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LucidUpgrades#Network%20Upgrade%20for%20Ubuntu%20Servers%20%28Recommended%29 ? It says they're for Ubuntu Server, but will work with Desktop too.
2010-04-30T06:31:00.000Z	collier_s	rww	not yet, i'll give a try
2010-04-30T06:32:00.000Z	collier_s	rww	yea, i have, i get this message: "No new release found"
2010-04-30T06:32:00.000Z	rww	collier_s	oh, I think I see what's going on. What's the output of the "uname -a" Terminal command?
