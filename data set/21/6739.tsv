2007-05-19T06:58:00.000Z	chrisjs169		ok, i've got an Intel Ethernet Pro 100 NIC that isn't working - dhclient fails with SIOCSIFFLAGS: Resource temporarily unavailable - any suggestions?
2007-05-19T06:59:00.000Z	mwe	chrisjs169	bring down the interface then bring it back up at look at the output of dmesg
2007-05-19T06:59:00.000Z	chrisjs169	mwe	thanks
2007-05-19T07:00:00.000Z	chrisjs169	mwe	bringing it up shows the same error, nothing happens in dmesg
2007-05-19T07:01:00.000Z	mwe	chrisjs169	so ifconfig ethX down && ifconfig ethX up says that?
2007-05-19T07:01:00.000Z	mwe	chrisjs169	using sudo
2007-05-19T07:01:00.000Z	chrisjs169	mwe	yeah
2007-05-19T07:01:00.000Z	mwe	chrisjs169	mmm
2007-05-19T07:02:00.000Z	chrisjs169	mwe	I also had this problem about a year ago, but I know the NIC works
2007-05-19T07:02:00.000Z	mwe	chrisjs169	dmesg|grep eth, does your nic show?
2007-05-19T07:02:00.000Z	mwe	chrisjs169	maybe the driver for it is not loaded for some reason
2007-05-19T07:02:00.000Z	mwe	chrisjs169	how did you fix it a year ago?
2007-05-19T07:02:00.000Z	chrisjs169	mwe	I didn't =/
2007-05-19T07:03:00.000Z	mwe	chrisjs169	dmesg|grep eth, does your nic show?
2007-05-19T07:03:00.000Z	chrisjs169	mwe	it does appear in dmesg
2007-05-19T07:04:00.000Z	mwe	chrisjs169	are you sure it's using the correct driver? sometimes, though seldom, a wrong driver gets loaded
2007-05-19T07:04:00.000Z	chrisjs169	mwe	i'm not sure if i'm using the correct driver.  what driver do you suggest I use?
2007-05-19T07:05:00.000Z	mwe	chrisjs169	i don't know the card ;)
2007-05-19T07:05:00.000Z	mwe	chrisjs169	lspci | grep Eth
