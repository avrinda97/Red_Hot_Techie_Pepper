2009-01-18T01:15:00.000Z	paulievox		I'm running Zoneminder (linux security camera platform) on an Intrepid 8.1 PC (xubuntu)
2009-01-18T01:15:00.000Z	paulievox		with two NIC cards. I have 6 "IP" security cameras, which i placed
2009-01-18T01:15:00.000Z	paulievox		on their own network (10.0.1.x) with its own router.
2009-01-18T01:15:00.000Z	paulievox		The "Front Of House" connection lives on a 192.168.1.x network
2009-01-18T01:15:00.000Z	paulievox		with its own router.
2009-01-18T01:15:00.000Z	paulievox		Currently i'm bridging the connections on the Linux PC,

2009-01-18T01:17:00.000Z	paulievox		I have a general routing question (2 NICs, subnets) http://paste.ubuntu.com/106036/plain/
2009-01-18T01:18:00.000Z	n8tuser	paulievox	-> can you draw a layout? pictures is worht a thousand words
2009-01-18T01:18:00.000Z	paulievox		Ok. hang on
2009-01-18T01:29:00.000Z	paulievox		Ok n8tuser -> here's my layout http://img504.imageshack.us/my.php?image=cameraservertopologyme0.pdf
2009-01-18T01:31:00.000Z	n8tuser	paulievox	-> and what is the issue ?
2009-01-18T01:31:00.000Z	paulievox		is the a good way to set this up?  should i add a static route in the 192 gateway to the 10.0 network?
2009-01-18T01:32:00.000Z	n8tuser		!who | paulievox
2009-01-18T01:33:00.000Z	paulievox	n8tuser	sorry, i haven't used IRC in years.
2009-01-18T01:34:00.000Z	n8tuser	paulievox	-> and what is the issue  with your setup?
2009-01-18T01:34:00.000Z	paulievox	n8tuser	is the most intelligent way to got about this, or should i setup static routes on the gateways?
2009-01-18T01:35:00.000Z	n8tuser	paulievox	-> i dont know about most intelligent way, the goals is for your server to see the captured pix of the cameras ?
2009-01-18T01:36:00.000Z	paulievox	n8tuser	yeah, to capture mjpgs off the cams and serve them on apache via the FOH network.
2009-01-18T01:36:00.000Z	paulievox	n8tuser	which is working, i just want to know what the best setup is for performance issues
2009-01-18T01:38:00.000Z	n8tuser	paulievox	-> if you have a working layout i would not interfere with it, unless there is a complain of not able to see the pics
