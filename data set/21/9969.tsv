2005-06-07T11:21:00.000Z	synd	iceman2K	it can be lower but i dont think its usable
2005-06-07T11:22:00.000Z	synd	iceman2K	xfce or fluxbox
2005-06-07T11:23:00.000Z	synd	iceman2K	you ought to look at damn small linux for a system like that..
2005-06-07T11:25:00.000Z	synd	iceman2K	stick with fluxbox and xfce
2005-06-07T11:29:00.000Z	synd	iceman2K	ive got an old athlon 1.3 ghz box i can give you : )
2005-06-07T11:30:00.000Z	iceman2K	synd	... i'd take it for the kids ... wife system is a 1.1 celeron ..
2005-06-07T11:30:00.000Z	synd	iceman2K	it stripped it down before i found out about ubuntu or linux for that matter. i deemed it "unusable"

2005-06-07T11:31:00.000Z	synd	iceman2K	a celeron 600 and an athlon 1.3, the athlon has DDR
2005-06-07T11:32:00.000Z	iceman2K	synd	add small harddrives ... and donate them to some kids ... some kids never see a pc ... which sucks ..
2005-06-07T11:32:00.000Z	synd	iceman2K	thats a good idea.
2005-06-07T11:32:00.000Z	synd	iceman2K	introduce them to Ubuntu
2005-06-07T11:33:00.000Z	iceman2K	synd	... knew a pc shop in colorado.. they took in used unwanted systems .. got them working and raffelled them to kids in schools ...
