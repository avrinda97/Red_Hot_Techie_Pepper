2008-02-26T17:54:00.000Z	Dr_willis	darx	 it may just be instaleld to your .firefox dir.
2008-02-26T18:03:00.000Z	Dr_willis	darx	 i recall the flash company ftp server having archives of the older versions
2008-02-26T18:03:00.000Z	darx	Dr_willis	will look in to that thanks.
2008-02-26T18:04:00.000Z	Dr_willis	darx	 some flash thread i read mentioned that they keep ALL the old versions in one huge archive.. (which i though was weird)
2008-02-26T18:04:00.000Z	darx	Dr_willis	i'm trying to find it.
2008-02-26T18:10:00.000Z	darx	Dr_willis	here the ftp mirrored http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/ no flash there
2008-02-26T18:12:00.000Z	Dr_willis	darx	 i got no idea. thats just what i heard mentined on the various flash threads a few weeks ago when we had the flash-fiasco
2008-02-26T18:13:00.000Z	darx	Dr_willis	ok np... :-)
2008-02-26T18:14:00.000Z	Dr_willis	darx	 they were discussing some way to let the users select older flash versions.. aparently adobe makes that hard.
2008-02-26T18:15:00.000Z	darx	Dr_willis	adobe sucks.. they are planning to drm flash video and do other nasty drm shit on the web. adobe should die.
2008-02-26T18:16:00.000Z	Dr_willis	darx	 given how poorly flash video looks compared to what i see on stage6.com :) im suprised its still arround.
2008-02-26T18:16:00.000Z	darx	Dr_willis	stage6 is dead
2008-02-26T18:16:00.000Z	darx	Dr_willis	they are killing it
2008-02-26T18:16:00.000Z	Dr_willis	darx	 yep.  Ya gotta be fast to get the less-then-legal videos. :)
2008-02-26T18:23:00.000Z	darx	Dr_willis	is pici fscking bot?
2008-02-26T18:23:00.000Z	Dr_willis	darx	 no idea. ping him 10000 times and see if he complains.
2008-02-26T18:24:00.000Z	darx	Dr_willis	he he
