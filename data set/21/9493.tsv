2008-09-01T02:55:00.000Z	kyle__		Hello, Stefan.
2008-09-01T02:55:00.000Z	Flannel	kyle__	please stop that
2008-11-11T12:53:00.000Z	Flannel	kyle__	It's a text editor, you can use nano instead
2008-11-11T12:53:00.000Z	kyle__	Flannel	 nano thank you i think i will figure it out from there (wish me luck)
2008-11-11T13:10:00.000Z	kyle__	Flannel	i hate to bother youa gain but i cant get the existing file open in nano, it keep smaking a new file
2008-11-11T13:12:00.000Z	Flannel	kyle__	What command are you using?
2008-11-11T13:14:00.000Z	Flannel	kyle__	Because as a regular user you don't own everything.  That's a good thing.  You can't edit all of the files by default (which means you're more secure)
2008-11-11T13:15:00.000Z	kyle__	Flannel	but if i need to edit these files how do i log intothe 'owner' name to edit them?
2008-11-11T13:15:00.000Z	Flannel	kyle__	You don't need to log in, you just ened to use sudo.  sudo command does command as the super user.
2008-11-11T13:23:00.000Z	Flannel	kyle__	To edit it?  sudo nano /etc/X11/xwrapper.conf
2008-11-11T13:23:00.000Z	Flannel	kyle__	case is important, you can use tab complete as well.
2008-11-11T13:24:00.000Z	kyle__	Flannel	if i've been pulling my mohawk out because i haven't been paying attention to case sensitivity i'm going to use my paintball claymore on my face again
2008-11-11T13:25:00.000Z	Flannel	kyle__	but on the bright side, you'll have your file open.
2008-11-11T13:27:00.000Z	kyle__	Flannel	i'm a little ocnfused because i just typed it without the -e and it didn'tw ork at all, so i typed sudo -e /etc/X11/Xwrapper.config and it opened nano (like normal) and on the top for the file name it keeps saying /var/tmp/Xwrapper.config/XXDlyYyY
2008-11-11T13:28:00.000Z	Flannel	kyle__	No, why are you using -e?  don't use -e, do this instead:  sudo nano /path/to/file
2008-11-11T13:29:00.000Z	kyle__	Flannel	 THANK YOU!!!!!
2008-11-11T13:29:00.000Z	kyle__	Flannel	<3
