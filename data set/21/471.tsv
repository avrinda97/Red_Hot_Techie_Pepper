2011-11-25T19:23:00.000Z	canterer		      You need to install a terminal library; for example ncurses.
2011-11-25T19:23:00.000Z	canterer		      Or specify the name of the library with --with-tlib.

2011-11-25T19:24:00.000Z	yeats	canterer	try 'sudo apt-get install vim'
2011-11-25T19:25:00.000Z	canterer	yeats	 I have load the package
2011-11-25T19:26:00.000Z	yeats	canterer	why are you building vim from source?
2011-11-25T19:26:00.000Z	yeats	canterer	I don't understand - is there a reason you're installing vim from source rather than just installing the repo version?
2011-11-25T19:27:00.000Z	canterer	yeats	: not the repo version
2011-11-25T19:28:00.000Z	yeats	canterer	I'll ask again... why are you not using the repo version?
2011-11-25T19:28:00.000Z	canterer	yeats	:  I want to improv the vim
2011-11-25T19:29:00.000Z	canterer	yeats	so I can have a envirment  that can siut to my develop
2011-11-25T19:38:00.000Z	yeats	canterer	vim from source will behave the same as vim from the repos... customizing happens in /etc/vim/vimrc (system-wide) or ~/.bashrc for just your user
2011-11-25T19:39:00.000Z	yeats	canterer	if you're committed to building from source, I would do 'sudo apt-get build-dep vim' before continuing
2011-11-25T19:39:00.000Z	yeats	canterer	yes - I meant ~/.vimrc
2011-11-25T20:17:00.000Z	yeats	canterer	great! happy to help
