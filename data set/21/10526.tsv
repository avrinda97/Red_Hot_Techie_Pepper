2005-04-16T12:02:00.000Z	apokryphos	naruto	it depends on what you're killing
2005-04-16T12:29:00.000Z	apokryphos	naruto	it could be several things, but doesn't seem to be a problem with X. Could be permissions, just GNOME (for a reason I wouldn't know). Have you tried logging into another DE/
2005-04-16T12:30:00.000Z	apokryphos	naruto	Desktop Environment
2005-04-16T12:31:00.000Z	apokryphos	naruto	GNOME/KDE etc.
2005-04-16T12:31:00.000Z	apokryphos	naruto	what? Same problem on KDE?
2005-04-16T12:32:00.000Z	apokryphos	naruto	hmm, and this is a fresh installation, or not?
2005-04-16T12:32:00.000Z	apokryphos	naruto	hmm, could possibly be X stuff, could be permission stuff, but I'm really quit esure KDE wouldn't freeze up
2005-04-16T12:37:00.000Z	apokryphos	naruto	so this CD is the RC?
2005-04-16T12:37:00.000Z	apokryphos	naruto	you could try (i) reconfiguring your X (though not sure how that could be the problem), or (ii) do a dist-upgrade
2005-04-16T12:43:00.000Z	apokryphos	naruto	reconfiguring: in console, type "dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
2005-04-16T12:50:00.000Z	apokryphos	naruto	if you really want to leave [k] ubuntu, I'd say go for MEPIS
