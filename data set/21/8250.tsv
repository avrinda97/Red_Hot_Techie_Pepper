2007-03-18T09:09:00.000Z	ikonia	locke	yes
2007-03-18T09:10:00.000Z	locke	ikonia	where does it log the latest updates installed, i need to find the last 6 to uninstall them to figure out why my hard drive won't mount
2007-03-18T09:36:00.000Z	ikonia	locke	 I suspect its something you did as you have a lot of problems that others don't
2007-03-18T09:37:00.000Z	locke	ikonia	It did show up at first but wouldn't mount, said something about pmount...then I unmounted it, and it hasn't shown up since =x
2007-03-18T09:37:00.000Z	ikonia	locke	I suspect its something you've done more
2007-03-18T09:39:00.000Z	locke	ikonia	 my flash drive mounts fine though =\
2007-03-18T09:39:00.000Z	ikonia	locke	so ?
2007-03-18T09:40:00.000Z	ikonia	locke	no idea, as I said I suspect its something you've broke as you've had a lot of problems that others don't
2007-03-18T09:53:00.000Z	locke	ikonia	rolling back the drivers worked like a charm ;)
