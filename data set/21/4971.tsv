2009-09-07T02:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mijap	sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-173
2009-09-07T02:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mijap	ok what do you get if you run:
2009-09-07T02:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mijap	gksudo nvidia-settings
2009-09-07T02:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mijap	does it say no driver loaded
2009-09-07T02:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mijap	the monitor isnt important
2009-09-07T02:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mijap	is the monitor a crt or flatscreen?
2009-09-07T02:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mijap	run: gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-09-07T02:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mijap	you will see Identifier     "Configured Video Device"
2009-09-07T02:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mijap	under that you will need to add: Driver "nvidia"
2009-09-07T02:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mijap	if a driver line already exists then change it to nvidia
2009-09-07T02:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mijap	then save the file and restart x
