2010-01-14T05:03:00.000Z	unr3a1	Ziber	oh, alright. I do not have any experience with hvm.  sorry.
2010-01-14T04:59:00.000Z	unr3a1	Ziber	are you trying to mount a iso as a virtual cd-rom?
2010-01-14T05:00:00.000Z	Ziber	unr3a1	well, not sure. i mean, im running xen, but non-hvm, so i was wondering if there's another way of installing the contents of the iso to the virtual HD?
2010-01-14T05:01:00.000Z	unr3a1	Ziber	so you are trying to setup a virtual machine on your computer?
2010-01-14T05:02:00.000Z	Ziber	unr3a1	specifically trying to install from an iso on non-hvm. debootstrap works, but there's no ubuntu 9.10 debootstrap template
2010-01-14T05:03:00.000Z	Ziber	unr3a1	im not using hvm. im using pv.
2010-01-14T05:04:00.000Z	unr3a1	Ziber	sorry, should have been more specific.  I do not have any experience with virtualization in linux.
2010-01-14T05:05:00.000Z	unr3a1	Ziber	I would just assume to mount the ISO to a folder and then rip the contents of the folder to your virtual HDD, but I dont know if that would work for what you are trying to do.
2010-01-14T05:05:00.000Z	Ziber	unr3a1	"rip"? how?
2010-01-14T05:06:00.000Z	unr3a1	Ziber	copy and paste
2010-01-14T05:07:00.000Z	unr3a1	Ziber	why are you running a virtual hdd?  are you trying to run a virtual machine while booted into linux?
2010-01-14T05:07:00.000Z	Ziber	unr3a1	have a box running ubuntu. decided to learn xen. made a VM. :P
2010-01-14T05:08:00.000Z	unr3a1	Ziber	ah.  ok.  makes sense now  :)
2010-01-14T05:09:00.000Z	Ziber	unr3a1	there has to be something more than simply copying...
2010-01-14T05:10:00.000Z	Ziber	unr3a1	and brb.
2010-01-14T05:10:00.000Z	unr3a1	Ziber	what is it that you are trying to install to this virtual hdd?  an OS, just a program for a OS that is already installed onto it?  you need to be a little more specific as to what you are exactly doing.
2010-01-14T05:13:00.000Z	Ziber	unr3a1	i want to install an iso of ubuntu 9.10 that i have onto this virtual HDD
2010-01-14T05:16:00.000Z	Ziber	unr3a1	can you do that without hvm?
2010-01-14T05:19:00.000Z	unr3a1	Ziber	I don;t really know.  I have some experience with virtualization, but only virtualization in windows.  But I am sure it follows along the same rules.  if you are trying to get a virtual machine to boot from a "cd-rom" it has to have one available to boot from.
2010-01-14T05:20:00.000Z	Ziber	unr3a1	for some reason, pv's cant use cdrom's, or something. idk. and brb dinner
2010-01-14T05:20:00.000Z	unr3a1	Ziber	then I would try a different form of virtualization if it does not allow you to set optical media to boot from
