2011-07-23T01:36:00.000Z	chrisyboy2	tensorpudding	hi im back, im booted into persistant ubuntu but its not letting me move the partition?
2011-07-23T01:38:00.000Z	tensorpudding	chrisyboy2	you said resize before, not move
2011-07-23T01:38:00.000Z	tensorpudding	chrisyboy2	if you want you can expand partitions, and contract them, but you can't pick them up and move them to a different part of the disk
2011-07-23T01:39:00.000Z	chrisyboy2	tensorpudding	 my original post said move, do i have a problem?
2011-07-23T01:39:00.000Z	chrisyboy2	tensorpudding	seems that it will only let me move right to left?
2011-07-23T01:41:00.000Z	tensorpudding	chrisyboy2	if you have something like
2011-07-23T01:41:00.000Z	tensorpudding	chrisyboy2	 a partition A, then empty space, then partition B, then more space
2011-07-23T01:42:00.000Z	tensorpudding	chrisyboy2	you can expand A to the right or B to left
2011-07-23T01:42:00.000Z	chrisyboy2	tensorpudding	 thats what i have?
2011-07-23T01:42:00.000Z	tensorpudding	chrisyboy2	but you can't swamp A and B's places
2011-07-23T01:42:00.000Z	tensorpudding	chrisyboy2	this is entirely a contrived example
2011-07-23T01:42:00.000Z	tensorpudding	chrisyboy2	how do i know what your partition layout looks like?
2011-07-23T01:44:00.000Z	chrisyboy2	tensorpudding	my partition layout is as, devsda1,devsda3,devsda5(files system),devsda6swap : i want to move devsda3 to devsda5?
2011-07-23T01:46:00.000Z	chrisyboy2	tensorpudding	is there noway i can do this?
2011-07-23T01:47:00.000Z	tensorpudding	chrisyboy2	there are ways, possibly, but they're all complex and involve backing up your files elsewhere, deleting partitions and recreating them, and moving files back onto them
2011-07-23T01:49:00.000Z	chrisyboy2	tensorpudding	this sucks surely i should just be able to expand over ?
2011-07-23T01:51:00.000Z	tensorpudding	chrisyboy2	please state exactly what you want to do
2011-07-23T01:52:00.000Z	chrisyboy2	tensorpudding	 as of the table i have 10 gigs of space(sda3)deleted formated whatever, i want to put this into sda5 and kill sda3
2011-07-23T01:53:00.000Z	chrisyboy2	tensorpudding	so that sda5 is 10 gigs bigger
2011-07-23T01:54:00.000Z	tensorpudding	chrisyboy2	and there is an sda4 in the middle?
2011-07-23T01:54:00.000Z	chrisyboy2	tensorpudding	no sda4
