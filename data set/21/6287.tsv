2008-03-06T21:39:00.000Z	LuiCal		well, yes, but thats something i put myself on fstab
2008-03-06T21:39:00.000Z	LuiCal		but it still doesnt work
2008-03-06T21:40:00.000Z	neverblue	LuiCal	does 'sudo mount -a', currently, give any errors?
2008-03-06T21:36:00.000Z	neverblue	LuiCal	please, stop repeating and be patient
2008-03-06T21:37:00.000Z	neverblue	LuiCal	did you add an entry into your fstab?
2008-03-06T21:38:00.000Z	neverblue	LuiCal	so you have no entry in your fstab, for that partition?
2008-03-06T21:41:00.000Z	neverblue	LuiCal	can you please post your fstab on pastebin for me, thanks
2008-03-06T21:44:00.000Z	neverblue	LuiCal	well, I would need the URL to view it :D
2008-03-06T21:55:00.000Z	neverblue	LuiCal	sorry for leaving you hanging, boss came by
2008-03-06T21:57:00.000Z	neverblue	LuiCal	does something exist @ /dev/hdb1 ?
2008-03-06T21:59:00.000Z	neverblue	LuiCal	i would suggest gettting 'mount' to work on the drive first, then add an entry into fstab
2008-03-06T21:59:00.000Z	neverblue	LuiCal	now you read 'man mount'
2008-03-06T22:02:00.000Z	neverblue	LuiCal	we helped you so far, time to help yourself :D
