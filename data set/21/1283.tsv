2011-02-27T22:03:00.000Z	Zeratul2k		finally!
2011-02-27T22:04:00.000Z	Zeratul2k		i hate it when i'm forced to register just to ask one question...
2011-02-27T22:05:00.000Z	Zeratul2k		anyway, i'm the guy with the "screen dimming after random times even when plugged in and brightness keys not working" guy. Found nothing int he BIOS as someone suggested
2011-02-27T22:06:00.000Z	Zeratul2k		any other ideas? the laptop is a HP Probook 4710s and I have checked gnome's power settings, everything having to do with idle is disabled
2011-02-27T22:07:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	Zeratul2k	does it dim randomly? or just start off dim?
2011-02-27T22:08:00.000Z	Zeratul2k	pragmaticenigma	it dims randomly, even when i'm working, and won't restore brightness unless I restart the computer since the brightness keys aren't working
2011-02-27T22:08:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	Zeratul2k	what is the graphics chipset in your machine?
2011-02-27T22:09:00.000Z	Zeratul2k	pragmaticenigma	it's an ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4300 Series
2011-02-27T22:10:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	Zeratul2k	do you have the ATI propriatary drivers installed?
2011-02-27T22:11:00.000Z	Zeratul2k	pragmaticenigma	yes, i do have them installed
2011-02-27T22:12:00.000Z	Zeratul2k	pragmaticenigma	I tried changing the gamma and other options there, but it changes the image, not the screen brightness
2011-02-27T22:12:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	Zeratul2k	I think I may have found a place with a solution for you http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-1465723.html
2011-02-27T22:13:00.000Z	Zeratul2k	pragmaticenigma	will take a look at it, brb
2011-02-27T22:13:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	Zeratul2k	you can also try "sudo echo 100 > /proc/acpi/video/VGA/LCD/brightness"
2011-02-27T22:15:00.000Z	Zeratul2k	pragmaticenigma	don't have a VGA on /proc/acpi/video/, just a DGFX
2011-02-27T22:16:00.000Z	Zeratul2k	pragmaticenigma	yep, it works
2011-02-27T22:17:00.000Z	Zeratul2k	pragmaticenigma	should create a custom launcher in the meantime, then?
2011-02-27T22:18:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	Zeratul2k	there is obviously a bug in the propriatry drivers supplied by ATI, hopefully they fix it at some point
2011-02-27T22:18:00.000Z	Zeratul2k	pragmaticenigma	yeah, looks like it. Going to see if I can file a bug report to them
2011-02-27T22:19:00.000Z	Zeratul2k	pragmaticenigma	thanks for all your help, this low brightness was killing my eyes!
2011-02-27T22:20:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	Zeratul2k	I sent you a couple PMs
