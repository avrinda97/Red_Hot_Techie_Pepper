2009-02-27T12:45:00.000Z	gldtn		how do I check my gtk version?
2009-02-27T12:45:00.000Z	crdlb	gldtn	apt-cache policy libgtk2.0-0
2009-02-27T12:49:00.000Z	crdlb	gldtn	you need libgtk2.0-dev
2009-02-27T12:51:00.000Z	crdlb	gldtn	yes, it contains the development headers, which allow code to be compiled against it
2009-02-27T12:53:00.000Z	crdlb	gldtn	firefox is completely fullscreen? (ie you don't see the panels either)
2009-02-27T12:54:00.000Z	gldtn	crdlb	no why?
2009-02-27T12:55:00.000Z	gldtn	crdlb	oops wrong person you wrote
2009-02-27T12:55:00.000Z	crdlb	gldtn	oops, sorry :)
2009-02-27T12:55:00.000Z	gldtn	crdlb	nick completion can be a pain sometimes
2009-02-27T12:57:00.000Z	crdlb	gldtn	especially when I'm looking at a /lastlog :)
2009-02-27T13:09:00.000Z	crdlb	gldtn	what's the problem?
2009-02-27T13:11:00.000Z	crdlb	gldtn	looks like you need clearlooks, murrine, and aurora
2009-02-27T13:12:00.000Z	crdlb	gldtn	ah, there's no included metacity theme; you need to use emerald instead with that .emerald theme
2009-02-27T13:12:00.000Z	gldtn	crdlb	seems like I have all.. what the command so I can see the ones installed
2009-02-27T13:13:00.000Z	gldtn	crdlb	or just emerald on it's own?
2009-02-27T13:13:00.000Z	crdlb	gldtn	sounds like you've already handled the gtk part, so you need to install emerald and use that as your decorator (which means you also need to be using compiz)
2009-02-27T13:13:00.000Z	gldtn	crdlb	also does emerald rely on compiz fusion or can it be run alone?
2009-02-27T13:13:00.000Z	crdlb	gldtn	the theme creator  really ought to include a metacity theme since he's not doing anything too fancy with the emerald theme anyway
2009-02-27T13:17:00.000Z	crdlb	gldtn	the easiest way is to use ccsm and put it in Window Decoration > Command
2009-02-27T13:20:00.000Z	gldtn	crdlb	you lost me..
2009-02-27T13:21:00.000Z	crdlb	gldtn	oops, I guess that was more for spike_
