2010-08-25T00:22:00.000Z	thune3	iConfused	the "cut's off at 20%" is normal/typcial behavior
2010-08-25T00:23:00.000Z	iConfused	thune3	Oh. That's not good on a laptop XD
2010-08-25T00:26:00.000Z	thune3	iConfused	it makes the bottom %20 not very useful, i don't understand how that's all that bad. you can launch alsamixer to watch what it is doing at the bottom 20%.
2010-08-25T00:27:00.000Z	iConfused	thune3	I can't make it quieter with a knob like an external speaker. It is quite loud at that volume.
2010-08-25T00:29:00.000Z	thune3	iConfused	oh i see. I would install gnome-alsamixer, and see if you can get good settings directly.
2010-08-25T00:31:00.000Z	iConfused	thune3	Thank you, I'll try that
2010-08-25T00:32:00.000Z	thune3	iConfused	when you launch it (while silence is playing), adjust the pulse volume up and all the way down to see what it is doing, I thing you need to set PCM/LFE to something in the middle and then adjust master.
2010-08-25T00:32:00.000Z	iConfused	thune3	Thanks ^^
2010-08-25T00:34:00.000Z	iConfused	thune3	Both PCM and LFE Go all the way to max if I change the volume (Up OR Down)
2010-08-25T00:34:00.000Z	iConfused	thune3	Actually
2010-08-25T00:34:00.000Z	thune3	iConfused	play around in the bottom 20%
2010-08-25T00:35:00.000Z	iConfused	thune3	^
2010-08-25T00:40:00.000Z	iConfused	thune3	is there a command for increasing/decreasing the master volume *ONLY*?
2010-08-25T00:42:00.000Z	thune3	iConfused	where do you have PCM/LFE setting?
2010-08-25T00:42:00.000Z	iConfused	thune3	a little over halfway up
2010-08-25T00:43:00.000Z	thune3	iConfused	and then that gives you the range you want by only controlling master?
2010-08-25T00:43:00.000Z	iConfused	thune3	yes, I'm happy with the range
2010-08-25T00:43:00.000Z	thune3	iConfused	i'll look around to see if something can be set to configure pulse
2010-08-25T00:44:00.000Z	iConfused	thune3	thank you so much. :)
2010-08-26T05:18:00.000Z	iConfused	thune3	I found out something about my audio troubles. I can keep the PCM all the way up, and just turn off the LFE completely. I just don't get the subwoofer. But, bam, no audio quality degradation :D
2010-08-26T05:21:00.000Z	thune3	iConfused	cool, glad you found something that is satisfactory
