2011-11-08T01:23:00.000Z	guy_		hi,i've installed nvidia driver but it says "driver is activated but not in use". moreover when i run nvidia-settings i get "You do not appear to be using the NVIDIA X driver.  Please edit your X configuration file (just run `nvidia-xconfig` as root), and restart the X server."please help
2011-11-08T01:24:00.000Z	ganimede	guy_	have you done: "sudo nvidia-xconfig" and reboot the computer?
2011-11-08T01:25:00.000Z	guy_	ganimede	this is the output of sudo nvidia-xconfig "sudo: nvidia-xconfig: command not found"
2011-11-08T01:27:00.000Z	ganimede	guy_	strange... anyway i remember i had some hard time to activate my nvidia card, but didnt go into it, for sure
2011-11-08T01:27:00.000Z	ganimede		ah yes, now i remember... settings/additional drivers: there you can choose
2011-11-08T01:27:00.000Z	ganimede		if i remember correctly, had to reboot a few times
2011-11-08T01:28:00.000Z	guy_	ganimede	i have already done that
2011-11-08T01:28:00.000Z	guy_	ganimede	hi,i've installed nvidia driver but it says "driver is activated but not in use". moreover when i run nvidia-settings i get "You do not appear to be using the NVIDIA X driver.

2011-11-08T01:29:00.000Z	ganimede		i remember that activated but not in use on my config, too, but then i managed to go past it
2011-11-08T01:29:00.000Z	ganimede		with the additional driver settings menu
2011-11-08T01:30:00.000Z	ganimede		I have also installed some other packages, but I really couldnt tell which one is required for nvidia
2011-11-08T01:32:00.000Z	guy_	ganimede	one more thing when i do /etc/X11/xorg.conf it says no such file or directory
2011-11-08T01:32:00.000Z	ganimede	guy_	dont go into the configuration manually
2011-11-08T01:33:00.000Z	ganimede		there is an easy way
2011-11-08T01:33:00.000Z	guy_		ganimede,then what should i do.i've been trying to setup nvidia for days now
2011-11-08T01:34:00.000Z	ganimede	guy_	google says:
2011-11-08T01:35:00.000Z	ganimede		sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates /// sudo apt-get update /// sudo apt-get install nvidia-current
2011-11-08T01:35:00.000Z	ganimede		replace the /// with newlines
2011-11-08T01:35:00.000Z	ganimede		basically, add a source repository and from it get the latest drivers
2011-11-08T01:36:00.000Z	guy_		ok
2011-11-08T01:36:00.000Z	guy_	ganimede	it'll take 5 min
