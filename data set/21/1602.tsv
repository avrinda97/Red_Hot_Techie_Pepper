2010-07-09T03:54:00.000Z	civixier		euphus, working so far :)
2010-07-09T03:55:00.000Z	mo__	civixier	why sleep? it isn't running on battery - is it?
2010-07-09T03:55:00.000Z	civixier		euphus, its a crossover cable ;)
2010-07-09T03:56:00.000Z	civixier	mo__	I rather want the computer to hibernate when inactive
2010-07-09T03:56:00.000Z	mo__	civixier	that shoudn't be a prob .. however, I'm more worried about the wakeup. how o you intent to wake it up?
2010-07-09T03:56:00.000Z	mo__	civixier	via network?
2010-07-09T03:58:00.000Z	mo__	civixier	man 8 sleepd should help if it's just about the matter to put the computer to sleep. waking up is another question ;)
2010-07-09T04:00:00.000Z	civixier	mo__	I think we have lost eachother on the way. I have an xbox, connected to my computer via a crossover cable. I want to be able to fall asleep while watching something. Both the xbox and the TV turn theirself off when inactive, i want the computer to do the same thing.
2010-07-09T04:02:00.000Z	mo__	civixier	ah yes ;) so .. hmmm... let sleepd watch the network device you use to connect to the xbox and set the --tx-min to something useful ... like more than 100kbit or so ...
2010-07-09T04:02:00.000Z	mo__	civixier	why don't you manually tell the computer to shutdown / fall asleep after a certain time? that's what I usually do ;)
2010-07-09T04:03:00.000Z	civixier	mo__	That was my original question, if the computer counts itself as inactive if the network is "running" :)
2010-07-09T04:03:00.000Z	civixier	mo__	but it doesnt?
2010-07-09T04:03:00.000Z	mo__	civixier	I wasn't here back then :p but yes, that's possible :)
2010-07-09T04:03:00.000Z	mo__	civixier	you told sleepd to behave this way and it didn't work?
2010-07-09T04:04:00.000Z	civixier	mo__	ahh, thank you ^^ so... how do I set the computer to hibernate after a certain time of inactivity? :D
2010-07-09T04:04:00.000Z	civixier	mo__	I havent done anything so far
2010-07-09T04:04:00.000Z	mo__	civixier	sec
2010-07-09T04:06:00.000Z	mo__	civixier	man 8 pm-suspend  - you can use it like this ... sleep 3600; pm-suspend; that would let it wait for an hour, then execute suspend
2010-07-09T04:06:00.000Z	mo__	civixier	ugly thingy is, that if you ctrl-c the sleep, it'll go immediatly to suspend ... hmmm sleep 3600 && pm-suspend should do the trick ... sry about the mixup before
2010-07-09T04:07:00.000Z	civixier		thanks mo__, thats awesome, i will never again need to disturb my beauty sleep ^^ im gonna look into that
2010-07-09T04:07:00.000Z	mo__	civixier	np :)
