2010-01-27T16:53:00.000Z	pietia	sol1tude	notebook:) thinpad r61
2010-01-27T16:53:00.000Z	sol1tude	pietia	if you have small screen and NOT gma500 accelerator than yes. it is better
2010-01-27T16:54:00.000Z	sol1tude	pietia	it is all as you wish :) someone loves gnome someone kde. start with gnome (ubuntu)
2010-01-27T16:55:00.000Z	pietia	sol1tude	hm :) so ubuntu + manually installed kde is something better kubuntu ?
2010-01-27T16:56:00.000Z	sol1tude	pietia	it is equal
2010-01-27T16:57:00.000Z	sol1tude	pietia	because of intel atom im using crunchbang - ubuntu with openbox
2010-01-27T17:09:00.000Z	pietia	sol1tude	are you happy with crunchbang?
2010-01-27T17:10:00.000Z	sol1tude	pietia	yes. Im very happe. now it is my favourite OS. I was on ubuntu kubuntu and debian.
2010-01-27T17:10:00.000Z	pietia	sol1tude	hm. openbox integrates well with kde-based apps ?
2010-01-27T17:10:00.000Z	pietia	sol1tude	does it offer something like kicker?
2010-01-27T17:10:00.000Z	sol1tude	pietia	i have VLC. it is perfect with openbox
2010-01-27T17:11:00.000Z	sol1tude	pietia	you mean panel ?
2010-01-27T17:12:00.000Z	sol1tude	pietia	it has tint2 panel - very customisable with text configuration file
2010-01-27T17:13:00.000Z	sol1tude	pietia	gnome network-manager applet :)
2010-01-27T17:13:00.000Z	sol1tude	pietia	yes it has a very good dock. tin2 panel for openbox. it is already installed
2010-01-27T17:13:00.000Z	pietia	sol1tude	nice :) crunchang is configured (gnome-net-manager ) ?
2010-01-27T17:14:00.000Z	sol1tude	pietia	everything works out of the box. you just tune it (chose theme etc..). also crunchbang have livecd so you can try it without installation :)
2010-01-27T17:15:00.000Z	pietia	sol1tude	what is the diff between standard/lite ver?
2010-01-27T17:15:00.000Z	sol1tude	pietia	in standard there are more applications. all them usable :)
