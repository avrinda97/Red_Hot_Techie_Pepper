2010-04-10T12:16:00.000Z	wolfie1		hello everyone =)
2010-04-10T12:16:00.000Z	wolfie1		in ubuntu netbook remix, there is no desktop, (how can I do that on normal ubuntu?)
2010-04-10T12:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wolfie1	 I installed the ubuntu-netbook  stuff on my desktop :) but  under 9.xx having both on the same machine can confiuse things.
2010-04-10T12:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wolfie1	 the 'desktop' is just handled by nautilus, the netbook edition dosent run that part of it.
2010-04-10T12:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wolfie1	 thats the netbook-launcher tool i belive
2010-04-10T12:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wolfie1	 if you run it  on a norml gnome session - it just appears above the desktop i think
2010-07-21T04:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wolfie1	 You left click on the speaker and it has a mute/unmute item.
2010-07-21T04:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wolfie1	 you could also run gnome-volume-applet
2010-07-21T04:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wolfie1	 you could also run gnome-volume-control-applet   :) my mistake
2010-07-21T04:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wolfie1	 try running gnome-volume-control and see if it has any clues
2010-07-21T04:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wolfie1	 is th wife logged in at the same time you are?
2010-07-21T04:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wolfie1	 as a test. i would suggest logging out both people. (perhaps a reboot) and log in only as your user. and see if sound works then.
2010-07-21T04:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wolfie1	 its possible skype is not playing nicely and shareing the sound system
2010-07-21T04:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wolfie1	 as a 2nd test. try making a new user . and see if sound works for that new user.
2010-07-21T04:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wolfie1	 run it from a terminal
2010-07-21T04:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wolfie1	 you really DONT want to be running stuff as sudo if you dont have a reason to.. its possible you running things like that as  the root user has goofed up your users settings.
2010-07-21T04:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wolfie1	 i would suggest making a new user and see if souind works for them.
2010-07-21T05:50:00.000Z	wolfie1	Dr_Willis	you tried help me earlier with problem of sound not wanting to work on 10.04.   i made new user, same problem, the speaker icon on panel is 0 and will not change.    wifes account still makes sound.   any more advice?
2010-07-21T05:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wolfie1	 that is weird.. Not sure what the issue could be. Unless it could be the user/groups she is in.
2010-07-21T05:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wolfie1	 root user? Huh, You mean the initial user that has 'sudo' rights?
2010-07-21T05:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wolfie1	  You may want to check the forums. I cant think of anything else that could cause it otuer then groups for teh differnt users.
