2006-08-05T12:59:00.000Z	oblib		how do I get a list of installed packages from the command line?
2006-08-05T12:59:00.000Z	nexu	oblib	^
2006-08-05T13:00:00.000Z	oblib	nexu	any way of sorting between default packages and ones I installed on my own?
2006-08-05T13:00:00.000Z	nexu	oblib	dpkg -l | grep ^ii
2006-08-05T13:01:00.000Z	nexu	oblib	dpkg -l shows what you have installed or was installed
2006-08-05T13:01:00.000Z	nexu	oblib	and erm .no
2006-08-05T13:01:00.000Z	nexu	oblib	'default' ?
2006-08-05T13:02:00.000Z	oblib	nexu	I'm thinking of restarting a Dapper install from scratch, but then want to install all the packages I had installed before
2006-08-05T13:02:00.000Z	oblib	nexu	my current Dapper upgrade has serious issues
2006-08-05T13:02:00.000Z	nexu	oblib	such as?
2006-08-05T13:02:00.000Z	nexu	oblib	i mean what kind of issues
2006-08-05T13:02:00.000Z	oblib		I updated from Breezy to Dapper and some programs that use sound freeze the machine.
2006-08-05T13:03:00.000Z	nexu	oblib	which ones ?
2006-08-05T13:03:00.000Z	oblib	nexu	for example I run fceu (which I compiled from source) and it says "couldn't get sound resource" or something and just freezes
2006-08-05T13:03:00.000Z	nexu	oblib	hmm ok well
2006-08-05T13:03:00.000Z	nexu	oblib	best thing you could do is run dpkg -l  > mypackagelist.log
2006-08-05T13:03:00.000Z	nexu	oblib	save it somewhere save
2006-08-05T13:04:00.000Z	nexu	oblib	reinstall
2006-08-05T13:04:00.000Z	oblib	nexu	then diff?
2006-08-05T13:04:00.000Z	nexu	oblib	and read back into the list
2006-08-05T13:04:00.000Z	oblib	nexu	good idea
