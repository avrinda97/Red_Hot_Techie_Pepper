2008-09-05T16:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kmg	uninstall bootsplash in any boot you can get
2008-09-05T16:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kmg	you may need to boot to live cd to edit the files that kick it up
2008-09-05T16:28:00.000Z	kmg	ActionParsnip	that's what I was afraid of.
2008-09-05T16:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kmg	it may be the case if you cant get any sort of boot then youll have to carve it out then remove it
2008-09-05T16:29:00.000Z	kmg	ActionParsnip	if I just uninstall the splash, then it will do a regular boot?
2008-09-05T16:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kmg	should do
2008-09-05T16:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kmg	you can chkdsk any umounted volume freely, you can do it on mounted partitions but its not advised
2008-09-05T16:41:00.000Z	kmg	ActionParsnip	but I suppose I can't do it from the grub command line =P
2008-09-05T16:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kmg	id do it from livecd. theres a way to shutdown and make it do it next boot before loading the os
2008-09-05T16:42:00.000Z	kmg	ActionParsnip	yeah, but I can't even boot.  I think I've tracked my problem down to some kind of filesystem corruption.  I managed to remove splash from the boot command, and now I see that it's hanging at trying to load the ext3-fs
2008-09-05T16:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kmg	id get in livecd town and check it out
2008-09-05T16:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kmg	you could always download a gentoo minimal for 80mb and use that
2008-09-05T16:45:00.000Z	kmg	ActionParsnip	i'd love to, but i'm on my eee pc right now which doesn't have a burner
2008-09-05T16:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kmg	make a bootable usb key ;)
2008-09-05T16:47:00.000Z	kmg	ActionParsnip	friend stole my last one!
2008-09-05T16:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kmg	theyre cheap o buy one ;)
2008-09-05T16:48:00.000Z	kmg	ActionParsnip	i could, but i wanna fix it RIGHT NOW ! =P
2008-09-05T16:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kmg	well you need some form of bootable media
2008-09-05T16:49:00.000Z	kmg	ActionParsnip	i've got a bunch of unlabeled disks, and I know several of them are livecds
