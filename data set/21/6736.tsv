2012-09-19T17:37:00.000Z	chamunks		Whats a nice ultra light version of ubuntu for older machines?
2012-09-19T17:37:00.000Z	BluesKaj	chamunks	how old ?
2012-09-19T17:38:00.000Z	chamunks	BluesKaj	its about 5 years and has probably a max of 1 gig of hdd and its likely a HP desktop
2012-09-19T17:39:00.000Z	BluesKaj	chamunks	my pc is 4 yrs old and runs kubuntu just fine , so ubuntu will probly run very well
2012-09-19T17:40:00.000Z	BluesKaj	chamunks	you mean 1G of Ram , right ?
2012-09-19T17:40:00.000Z	chamunks	BluesKaj	yes 1 gig of ram sorry hah didnt mean to say hdd
2012-09-19T17:43:00.000Z	BluesKaj	chamunks	of course it matters what you intend to run on the pc but 1G Ram is adequate for normal surfing , video , data and video as long as you don't have too much stuff going on simultaneously
2012-09-19T17:43:00.000Z	chamunks	BluesKaj	its for my cousins fairly computer illiterate crazy girlfriend.
2012-09-19T17:44:00.000Z	chamunks	BluesKaj	the more spoon feeding the os gives her the better
2012-09-19T17:46:00.000Z	BluesKaj	chamunks	you'll probly need to spoonfeed for a short while , as long as you set it up to make it easy, but going from windows or mac to ubuntu is quite a change in terms of desktop learning and adapting
2012-09-19T17:47:00.000Z	chamunks	BluesKaj	it would be so awesome if someone we're to make a youtube video series that just covers ultra basics and than snapped that into some ubuntu "Noobstation" app
2012-09-19T17:48:00.000Z	BluesKaj	chamunks	actaully kde is closer visually to windows , it's more familiar looking then gnome or unity
2012-09-19T17:50:00.000Z	chamunks	BluesKaj	yeah fair enough.  I was going through a bad phase of linux mint... I had installed mint on her machine thinking because I had one good experience with it over ubuntu when some package was for some reason broken in the repos.
2012-09-19T17:51:00.000Z	chamunks	BluesKaj	but at this point the lts version is looking great and working very smoothly on my desktop.  I wish graphics support were to improve but i guess that I can wait another two releases or so for my dual saphire radeon hd 6850's to be supported.
2012-09-19T17:51:00.000Z	BluesKaj	chamunks	I can't comment on mint , since I've never used it ,
2012-09-19T17:52:00.000Z	chamunks	BluesKaj	its a nice ui their mint menu is really the biggest difference.
2012-09-19T17:53:00.000Z	chamunks	BluesKaj	it recognizes that I have two cards but thats as far as it goes.
2012-09-19T17:55:00.000Z	BluesKaj	chamunks	I tried unity /gnome3 etc , ..just not my cuppa tea,  KDE suits my taste best
2012-09-19T17:55:00.000Z	chamunks	BluesKaj	I've always found kde just a bit less stable.  I really like where gnome3 is going myself.
2012-09-19T17:57:00.000Z	BluesKaj	chamunks	yeah in some setups . kde takes a bit more configuring , but the results are gratifying when we get it right
2012-09-19T17:58:00.000Z	chamunks	BluesKaj	ideally if i could script my mods or something but thats not reliable.
