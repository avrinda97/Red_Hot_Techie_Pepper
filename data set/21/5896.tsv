2007-09-30T06:26:00.000Z	sensae		Argh.
2007-09-30T06:26:00.000Z	sensae		Anyone familiar with getting the nvidia proprietary driver working?
2007-09-30T06:26:00.000Z	MeRodent	sensae	what card?
2007-09-30T06:26:00.000Z	sensae	MeRodent	6200
2007-09-30T06:27:00.000Z	MeRodent	sensae	what drivers have you tried?
2007-09-30T06:31:00.000Z	sensae	MeRodent	It works with the nv drivers, I just installed the nvidia drivers and now xorg won't run
2007-09-30T06:31:00.000Z	MeRodent	sensae	have you tried the restricted driver manager?
2007-09-30T06:32:00.000Z	sensae	MeRodent	That's how I did it
2007-09-30T06:32:00.000Z	MeRodent	sensae	try sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-new
2007-09-30T06:33:00.000Z	sensae	MeRodent	Ok, I will in a second
2007-09-30T06:33:00.000Z	sensae	MeRodent	Hm, wait a sec
2007-09-30T06:34:00.000Z	sensae	MeRodent	I got it to work - I accidentally booted to the wrong kernel
2007-09-30T06:35:00.000Z	MeRodent	sensae	lol
2007-09-30T06:35:00.000Z	MeRodent	sensae	I wish all problems where that easy. ;)
2007-09-30T06:35:00.000Z	sensae	MeRodent	Me too
2007-09-30T06:36:00.000Z	MeRodent	sensae	either change the default line in /boot/grub/menu.lst or change the position of the boot section.
2007-09-30T06:43:00.000Z	MeRodent	sensae	using beryl or compiz with emerald?
2007-09-30T06:44:00.000Z	sensae	MeRodent	I have compiz, do I need emerald?
2007-09-30T06:45:00.000Z	MeRodent	sensae	I find occasionally that the title bars dissappear when using helidor (emerald doesn't work at all) reloading the window decorator fixes the problem.
2007-09-30T06:46:00.000Z	sensae	MeRodent	Okay, hm. I'm not terribly familiar with compiz / beryl. Do I need emerald?
2007-09-30T06:47:00.000Z	MeRodent	sensae	you don't, it allows for nicer windows decorator but may or may not work. (works on 2 out of 3 machines I have).
