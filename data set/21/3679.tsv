2009-07-08T11:14:00.000Z	oly562		ha
2009-07-08T11:15:00.000Z	l7	oly562	have you tried using gparted to take a look?
2009-07-08T11:18:00.000Z	l7	oly562	try "sudo apt-get install gparted", and then look at http://www.fsckin.com/2007/10/21/partitioning-or-resizing-drives-in-ubuntu-using-gparted/  It's a graphical utility that may give you a better idea of how your drives are set up.
2009-07-08T11:21:00.000Z	oly562	l7	thanks, i will give it a whirl, bbiab
2009-07-08T11:28:00.000Z	l7	oly562	hmm, gparted will help show you what type of partitions you have on your machine.  'sudo fdisk -l' would probably work too.  once you know that, then you can try to mount it.
2009-07-08T11:30:00.000Z	l7	oly562	make sure you don't actually format or erase any partitions if your goal is to access the data on them though
2009-07-08T11:31:00.000Z	oly562	l7	sorry jumping screens, i will try to follow, tanks
2009-07-08T11:34:00.000Z	l7	oly562	how is sdb formated and how many partitions does it have?
2009-07-08T11:35:00.000Z	oly562	l7	fdisk -l doesnt show the drive, and i pasted its error earlier
2009-07-08T11:37:00.000Z	oly562	l7	/dev/sdb is not formated nor in use, just inside the laptop, and electricity pumping though it
2009-07-08T11:39:00.000Z	l7	oly562	so there is no data on /dev/sdb?  if that is the case, you can just partition and format it with gparted
2009-07-08T11:39:00.000Z	oly562	l7	k
