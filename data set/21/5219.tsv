2007-12-22T02:39:00.000Z	MikeH		how can I get ubuntu to reconfigure my display?
2007-12-22T02:40:00.000Z	MikeH		can anyone also tell me what driver an at x800xt should be using?
2007-12-22T02:40:00.000Z	macd	MikeH	fglrx, or ati.
2007-12-22T02:41:00.000Z	macd	MikeH	if you've recently upgraded to a new version of ubuntu, you may have to reconfigure your xserver
2007-12-22T02:41:00.000Z	MikeH	macd	I'm still on gutsy, as originally installed
2007-12-22T02:42:00.000Z	macd	MikeH	and it just magically stopped working, or?
2007-12-22T02:42:00.000Z	MikeH	macd	well, it was fine, until I restarted X a minute ago
2007-12-22T02:42:00.000Z	macd	MikeH	you can run from console, "dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" to reconfigure it
2007-12-22T02:43:00.000Z	MikeH	macd	That requires input from me, ubuntu originally configured my X server automatically, this must be possible again.
2007-12-22T02:43:00.000Z	macd	MikeH	if you applied the updates from earlier, and didnt reboot only restarted X you might have a problem till you reboot
2007-12-22T02:43:00.000Z	macd	MikeH	yes, just tell it your card, then hit enter throughout the rest of the process
2007-12-22T02:45:00.000Z	MikeH	macd	I think I've figured it
2007-12-22T02:46:00.000Z	MikeH	macd	I'll write that again with the mass join/quit, I think the problem is that it's defaulted back to xorg instead of xgl
2007-12-22T02:46:00.000Z	macd	MikeH	xorg and xgl are not the same thing
2007-12-22T02:46:00.000Z	macd	MikeH	xorg and xgl dont do the same thing, you use both.
2007-12-22T02:46:00.000Z	MikeH	macd	ok, fair enough.
2007-12-22T02:47:00.000Z	macd	MikeH	if you want to fix it, use the command I gave you earlier, I can even walk you through the questions
2007-12-22T02:47:00.000Z	macd	MikeH	ohhh
2007-12-22T02:47:00.000Z	MikeH	macd	I'm quite capable of going through x config, but give me a minute, I just re-enabled restricted driver, rebooting
2007-12-22T02:48:00.000Z	macd	MikeH	what does "cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf | grep Driver" tell you
2007-12-22T02:55:00.000Z	MikeH	macd	got a bit further this time, managed to  get 1152x768 even though I told xorg-config to do 1600x1200
