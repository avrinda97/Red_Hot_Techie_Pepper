2010-01-08T05:44:00.000Z	mkanyicy	guiscard	install ccsm
2010-01-08T05:44:00.000Z	guiscard	mkanyicy	this will rotate my desktop between workspaces?
2010-01-08T05:46:00.000Z	mkanyicy	guiscard	ccsm stands for compizconfig-settings-manager
2010-01-08T05:48:00.000Z	mkanyicy	guiscard	compiz is activated by default in ubuntu, ccsm is for the bells and whissles
2010-01-08T05:51:00.000Z	guiscard	mkanyicy	why they don't put ccsm by default? because when I saw an ubuntu catalog  it had pics of the desktop rotating but I couldn't figure it out
2010-01-08T05:53:00.000Z	mkanyicy	guiscard	have you managed to install ccsm? NO it's not installed by default, compiz is installed, ccsm tweaks compiz
2010-01-08T05:58:00.000Z	guiscard	mkanyicy	why are you angry? I'm sorry my english is not good maybe my question was poorly phrased
2010-01-08T05:58:00.000Z	mkanyicy	guiscard	angry, no no no, my friend,
2010-01-08T05:58:00.000Z	mkanyicy	guiscard	maybe my english is not polished enough ;)
2010-01-08T06:00:00.000Z	mkanyicy	guiscard	I am sorry if I sounded angry, but I was asking if ever you managed to install ccsm
2010-01-08T06:01:00.000Z	mkanyicy	guiscard	as far as I remember you were asking about making a 3D rotating cube
2010-01-08T06:07:00.000Z	guiscard	mkanyicy	it's alright bro I don't get hurt so ease. now the ccsm I've installed it how do I get the 3D cube?
2010-01-08T06:08:00.000Z	mkanyicy	guiscard	ALT+F2 then type ccsm
2010-01-08T06:13:00.000Z	guiscard	mkanyicy	thank you ;)
2010-01-08T06:13:00.000Z	mkanyicy	guiscard	no prob
2010-01-08T06:42:00.000Z	mkanyicy	guiscard	just remove unnecessary apps
2010-01-08T06:42:00.000Z	mkanyicy	guiscard	and do an apt-get clean
2010-01-08T06:43:00.000Z	guiscard	mkanyicy	how do I find the unnecessary ones?
2010-01-08T06:44:00.000Z	mkanyicy	guiscard	you can delete old kernel images
2010-01-08T06:45:00.000Z	mkanyicy	guiscard	but to downgrade so as to gain HDD space is ridiculous
2010-01-08T06:47:00.000Z	guiscard	mkanyicy	ok i'll delete some app
