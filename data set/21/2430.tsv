2009-11-07T22:51:00.000Z	c3l		lol, is there not any group of packages?
2009-11-07T22:51:00.000Z	usser	c3l	unfortunately not, you have to pick them out one by one
2009-11-07T22:56:00.000Z	c3l	usser	well is there a list of whats needed, or should i just randomly get what looks right?
2009-11-07T22:57:00.000Z	c3l	usser	.,,.librarys for ffmpeg
2009-11-07T22:57:00.000Z	usser	c3l	libav packages
2009-11-07T22:57:00.000Z	c3l	usser	its like 20 of them. both unstripped and extras?
2009-11-07T22:57:00.000Z	usser	c3l	libavcodec, libavformat, libavdevice theres a couple more
2009-11-07T22:57:00.000Z	usser	c3l	yea get both unstripped and extra
2009-11-07T23:00:00.000Z	c3l	usser	 libavcodec-extra-52: Conflicts: libavcodec52 is the extra and unstripped better than the normal? should I remove the standard and get extra and unstripped? this is confusing
2009-11-07T23:02:00.000Z	usser	c3l	yes remove the normal, unstripped or extra is the same except its got more codecs,
