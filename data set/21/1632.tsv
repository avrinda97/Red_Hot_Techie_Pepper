2010-06-19T23:13:00.000Z	FOREvERz		hello everyone)
2010-06-19T23:13:00.000Z	FOREvERz		has someone help me?)
2010-06-19T23:14:00.000Z	FOREvERz		i received ubuntu 10.4, but i have installed 9.04. can i upgrade it to 10.4?
2010-06-19T23:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	FOREvERz	recived 10.04?
2010-06-19T23:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	FOREvERz	a CD?
2010-06-19T23:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	FOREvERz	you can upgrade to 10.04 from 9.04,  but you would have to go through 9.10 first.  Also 9.04 is still supported untill the end of October, and it really is better than 10.04 in certain ways :)
2010-06-19T23:16:00.000Z	FOREvERz	sebsebseb	i am newbie in ubuntu or whole linux, so it will be better if I stay on 9.04?)
2010-06-19T23:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	FOREvERz	well you can try 10.04 from the Live CD
2010-06-19T23:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	FOREvERz	,but if I was still using 9.04, I would stay on that for now, I guess
2010-06-19T23:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	FOREvERz	most of that also applys to 9.04
2010-06-19T23:18:00.000Z	FOREvERz	sebsebseb	thank you :)
2010-06-19T23:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	FOREvERz	if you tried 10.04 from the CD boot it up, and like what you see,  you can upgrade to it yeah, but nothing wrong with 9.04 (except for a little while I don't like)  whilst its still supported
2010-06-19T23:22:00.000Z	FOREvERz	sebsebseb	then i can choose which ubuntu i can boot in GRUB?
2010-06-19T23:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	FOREvERz	no
2010-06-19T23:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	FOREvERz	on if you were to dual both both versions, which would be silly to do, and not so easy
2010-06-19T23:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	FOREvERz	I say sily to do since  9.04 will go end of life at the end of October, no more security updates, but also since  9.04 uses the old Grub, and 10.04 uses the new Grub 2 by default
2010-06-19T23:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	FOREvERz	the old version of Grub is actsaully better than Grub 2 for most people really :)
2010-06-19T23:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	FOREvERz	if you upgrade from 9.04 to 9.10 or 10.04, you would still have the old Grub :)   and then you could install Grub2 yourself, but not much point  in that.  Grub  as in the boot loader, that you boot Ubuntu from, if you don't understand
2010-06-19T23:24:00.000Z	FOREvERz	sebsebseb	okay, thaks :) i'll try 10.04, and may be i will use it without 9.04 :) pretty linux is something unbelievable  :)
2010-06-19T23:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	FOREvERz	there are also other distributions/distros and yes Linux really is something :)
2010-06-19T23:25:00.000Z	FOREvERz	sebsebseb	i mean Live CD)
