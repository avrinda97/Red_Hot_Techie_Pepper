2009-10-08T18:52:00.000Z	sipior	LucidGuy	which version of qt do you have installed?
2009-10-08T18:53:00.000Z	LucidGuy	sipior	I believe I have 3 and 4 .. quite a few qt packages installed.
2009-10-08T18:54:00.000Z	sipior	LucidGuy	does "ldd OCCiviewer | grep libqt" return anything?
2009-10-08T18:56:00.000Z	LucidGuy	sipior	a simple ldd OCCiviewer alone says not a dynamic executable
2009-10-08T18:57:00.000Z	sipior	LucidGuy	perhaps it's a script. try ldd on the called binary.
2009-10-08T18:58:00.000Z	LucidGuy	sipior	It is .. I see this at the bottom exec python2.4 ${PREFIX}/OCCIviewer.py "$@"
2009-10-08T18:59:00.000Z	sipior	LucidGuy	do you have the package python-qt3 installed?
2009-10-08T19:02:00.000Z	LucidGuy	sipior	yes ..
2009-10-08T19:10:00.000Z	sipior	LucidGuy	you might try modifying the script to call the most recent version of python installed on your system. the problem is not that python can't see the library, but that it can't load it.
2009-10-08T19:12:00.000Z	sipior	LucidGuy	and it might simply not work on your system. you can also try contacting whoever you got the program from.
2010-03-31T19:03:00.000Z	sipior	LucidGuy	it is correct.
2010-04-28T19:06:00.000Z	sipior	LucidGuy	have a look at "cssh"
2010-04-28T19:18:00.000Z	LucidGuy	sipior	will do .. looking into cssh
2010-06-16T18:41:00.000Z	sipior	LucidGuy	are you running a 64-bit version of the operating system?
2010-06-16T18:43:00.000Z	LucidGuy	sipior	 yes Ubuntu Hardy 64b
2010-06-16T20:43:00.000Z	sipior	LucidGuy	required reading: http://www.ex-parrot.com/pete/upside-down-ternet.html
2010-06-16T20:45:00.000Z	LucidGuy	sipior	 .. great page.
2012-03-15T22:21:00.000Z	sipior	LucidGuy	not really, unless the drives themselves are of poor quality, of course.
2012-03-15T22:22:00.000Z	LucidGuy	sipior	thats what I was thinking.
