2009-11-28T04:26:00.000Z	dupondje		somebody knows a tool to recover files from a half-broken harddisk ?
2009-11-28T04:27:00.000Z	acicula	dupondje	define half broken hard drive
2009-11-28T04:29:00.000Z	dupondje	acicula	bad blocks, some unreadable files. It didn't spin up anymore, had to open it. Now it gets seen by pc, but want to recover some files on it, not all
2009-11-28T04:29:00.000Z	acicula	dupondje	open as in you physically opened the drive?
2009-11-28T04:30:00.000Z	dupondje	acicula	yes
2009-11-28T04:30:00.000Z	acicula	dupondje	yeah you need a professional recovery service now
2009-11-28T04:31:00.000Z	dupondje	acicula	surely not, it shows the disk in ubuntu :) its mounted, and can see files, just want a programm that tries a bit harder to copy everything, instead on giving up after 1 read retry
2009-11-28T04:32:00.000Z	acicula	dupondje	well, in that case dd is as low as you can go
2009-11-28T04:32:00.000Z	dupondje	acicula	but with dd I can't copy files ? just the full parition ?
2009-11-28T04:33:00.000Z	acicula	dupondje	err yeah
2009-11-28T04:33:00.000Z	acicula	dupondje	dump the disk, then try to recover?
2009-11-28T04:33:00.000Z	acicula	dupondje	dunno then :/
2009-11-28T04:34:00.000Z	dupondje	acicula	k :) thx anyway :)
2010-05-02T21:15:00.000Z	acicula	dupondje	sensors-applet
2010-05-02T21:15:00.000Z	acicula	dupondje	it can use hddtemp and lm-sensors as input
2010-05-02T21:19:00.000Z	dupondje	acicula	how do I add the applet ? can't find it directly
2010-05-02T21:19:00.000Z	acicula	dupondje	gotta install it fist
2010-05-02T21:20:00.000Z	dupondje	acicula	thats done :)
2010-05-02T21:20:00.000Z	acicula	dupondje	gpanel may need to be reloaded for it to see it so you can add it
2010-05-02T21:20:00.000Z	acicula	dupondje	killall gpnanel , should come back on its own
