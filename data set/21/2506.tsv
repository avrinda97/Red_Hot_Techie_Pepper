2011-10-07T21:48:00.000Z	rhin0		maybe your graphics card isn't capable of running it primoz007 it requires power in graphics
2011-10-07T21:48:00.000Z	rhin0		or you need proprietary drivers to be loaded to enable it to work - proprietary for your graphics card from your graphics card vendor site
2011-10-07T21:48:00.000Z	rhin0		is it 3d theadmin
2011-10-07T21:48:00.000Z	rhin0		doesn't look 3d to me Oo
2011-10-07T21:49:00.000Z	theadmin	rhin0	Well it needs 3D acceleration
2011-10-07T21:49:00.000Z	theadmin	rhin0	I dunno.
2011-10-07T21:49:00.000Z	theadmin	rhin0	Unity is too weird for me, hey, I use Xfce
2011-10-07T21:54:00.000Z	theadmin	rhin0	Meh, I just use pacman most of the time ;)
2011-10-07T21:55:00.000Z	theadmin	rhin0	"installing" pacman?
2011-10-07T21:55:00.000Z	theadmin	rhin0	It comes with The Distro, Arch. You don't "install" it.
2011-10-07T21:56:00.000Z	theadmin	rhin0	Pacman is the package manager for Arch, it's not available (or, well, at least useful) for other distros
2011-10-07T22:09:00.000Z	theadmin	rhin0	Generate, or write manually, whatever.
2012-01-25T21:53:00.000Z	theadmin	rhin0	sudo apt-get install lxde
2012-01-25T22:03:00.000Z	theadmin	rhin0	See, let me explain. Gnome2 is no longer officially developed or supported so Ubuntu can't use it. Their options are Gnome3 or Unity. They went with Unity because Gnome3's a mess. You can still use other destkops though. XFCE is almost identical to gnome2, so I suggest you try it.
2012-01-25T22:11:00.000Z	theadmin	rhin0	It's the Gnome team which abandoned Gnome2. Gnome2 is no longer supported, and Gnome3 is horrible.
2012-01-25T22:11:00.000Z	theadmin	rhin0	Not Ubuntu's fault.
2012-02-06T12:01:00.000Z	theadmin	rhin0	Try XFCE
2012-02-06T12:02:00.000Z	theadmin	rhin0	KDE? LXDE? There are many alternatives to Unity
2012-02-06T12:03:00.000Z	theadmin	rhin0	Install gnome-fallback
