2006-01-07T08:57:00.000Z	cafuego	sportmankid	Go to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto
2006-01-07T08:57:00.000Z	cafuego	sportmankid	That (and nothing else) is what you should follow. ALL drivers are IN Ubuntu as packages, you do NOT need to downlaod external drivers.
2006-01-07T08:58:00.000Z	cafuego	sportmankid	Essentially what you need are xorg-driver-fglrx fglrx-control and linux-restricted-modules-2.6.12-KERNELVERSION
2006-01-07T08:59:00.000Z	sportmankid	cafuego	um does it matter if i already installed a different one
2006-01-07T08:59:00.000Z	cafuego	sportmankid	phos-phoros seems to know
2006-01-07T08:59:00.000Z	cafuego	sportmankid	Which different one did you installed?
2006-01-07T08:59:00.000Z	cafuego	sportmankid	Yeah, that's not the one you need. Fetch xorg-driver-fglrx.
2006-01-07T09:00:00.000Z	cafuego	sportmankid	(Just leave the other one)
2006-01-07T09:01:00.000Z	cafuego	sportmankid	Whehn that's done, /etc/X11/xorg.conf should be set to use the "fglrx" driver.
2006-01-07T09:02:00.000Z	cafuego	sportmankid	'grep fglrx /etc/X11/xorg.conf'
2006-01-07T09:08:00.000Z	cafuego	sportmankid	yes, you pasted output that my grep command could not have generated.
