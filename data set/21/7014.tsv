2007-08-14T13:57:00.000Z	Pelo	Curs0r	as I recall you donT' have much to build,  lyou just run it,  I helped someone with that a while back   , but he needed to get a few extra packages from the site to get the cd and stuffworking properly
2007-08-14T13:58:00.000Z	Pelo	Curs0r	 jsut read the readme and install files in the package

2007-08-26T05:51:00.000Z	Pelo	Curs0r	 what are you trying to get it to do
2007-08-26T05:51:00.000Z	Curs0r	Pelo	run a command every 15 minutes
2007-08-26T05:51:00.000Z	Curs0r	Pelo	just a basic shell script
2007-08-26T05:51:00.000Z	Pelo	Curs0r	 you'll need to put in 4 instances
2007-08-26T05:52:00.000Z	Pelo	Curs0r	 paste a sample line of your crontab entry , so I can check it
2007-08-26T05:53:00.000Z	Curs0r	Pelo	http://rafb.net/p/mDWLJ784.html
2007-08-26T05:54:00.000Z	Pelo	Curs0r	hold on

2007-08-26T05:55:00.000Z	Pelo	Curs0r	 try this one  01 * * * * bgprep compiz ,  make 4 instances and change 01 for 15, 30, 45
2007-08-26T06:01:00.000Z	Curs0r	Pelo	yeah, that does not work either
2007-08-26T06:01:00.000Z	Pelo	Curs0r	 the problem is probably your command at this point,  what is the script you need to start ?
2007-08-26T06:02:00.000Z	Curs0r	Pelo	the script runs fine, I have it set to  button now
2007-08-26T06:03:00.000Z	Pelo	Curs0r	 I'm not saying that the script is the problem , I'm stayin the command in crontab is not the right one to start the script
