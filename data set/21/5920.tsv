2007-09-07T12:03:00.000Z	teKnofreak	nicholaspaul	connected/link as in active physical connection.. do "sudo mii-tool"
2007-09-07T12:04:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	teKnofreak	'No MII interfaces found"
2007-09-07T12:04:00.000Z	teKnofreak	nicholaspaul	is your eth(x) up ?
2007-09-07T12:05:00.000Z	teKnofreak	nicholaspaul	if there is a link b/w your machine and the router, mii-tool should show it up
2007-09-07T12:05:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	teKnofreak	 oh its ath0. it shows up in ifconfig
2007-09-07T12:05:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	teKnofreak	oh i see. I'm 'trying' to connect wirelessly
2007-09-07T12:05:00.000Z	teKnofreak	nicholaspaul	ahh.. run dhclient3*
2007-09-07T12:06:00.000Z	teKnofreak	nicholaspaul	without the star
2007-09-07T12:06:00.000Z	teKnofreak	nicholaspaul	sudo dhclient3
2007-09-07T12:07:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	teKnofreak	that did the trick, thanks ! So do i have to use that command regularly?
2007-09-07T12:08:00.000Z	teKnofreak	nicholaspaul	nope.. it should run it when you bootup.. dhclient3 is for wireless
2007-09-07T12:08:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	teKnofreak	and what does that do?
2007-09-07T12:09:00.000Z	teKnofreak	nicholaspaul	dhclient3 queries the dhcp server thru wireless interface for a dhcp
2007-09-07T12:09:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	teKnofreak	ahhh

2007-09-07T12:09:00.000Z	teKnofreak	nicholaspaul	welcome :)
2007-09-07T12:09:00.000Z	teKnofreak	nicholaspaul	would have told it right in the beginning if I knew it was wireless ;)
