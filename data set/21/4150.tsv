2008-09-11T05:00:00.000Z	AlNahar	slashjamiec	can i get around that error?
2008-09-11T05:01:00.000Z	slashjamiec	AlNahar	I'm not sure, disabling the troubled device if you're not using it might work
2008-09-11T05:01:00.000Z	AlNahar	slashjamiec	nothing else is plugged in and it still happens
2008-09-11T05:01:00.000Z	slashjamiec	AlNahar	hmmm
2008-09-11T05:02:00.000Z	slashjamiec	AlNahar	You're running an LCD monitor, aren't you? :P
2008-09-11T05:04:00.000Z	AlNahar	slashjamiec	yes, an lcd monitor
2008-09-11T05:04:00.000Z	slashjamiec	AlNahar	It's to do with that. You'll need to edit your xorg.conf file to go with your LCD's "horiz sync" and "vert refresh", X is loading something that isn't supported. I can't help you on this matter because I don't know these functions for your monitor, refer to your manual.
2008-09-11T05:07:00.000Z	AlNahar	slashjamiec	can't i comment out thoselines?
2008-09-11T05:07:00.000Z	slashjamiec	AlNahar	Oh, oh, god no
2008-09-11T05:07:00.000Z	AlNahar	slashjamiec	i've done that in fedora before and it just did some defaults
2008-09-11T05:08:00.000Z	slashjamiec	AlNahar	Oh yeah, try reading http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=202934
2008-09-11T05:08:00.000Z	AlNahar	slashjamiec	so ubuntu wont work if you comment out those lines?
2008-09-11T05:09:00.000Z	slashjamiec	AlNahar	I'm unsure, read that forum post.
2008-09-11T05:09:00.000Z	AlNahar	slashjamiec	i ask because it works for me in another distro when i just comment it out
2008-09-11T05:11:00.000Z	slashjamiec	AlNahar	I'd imagine it isn't required, I'm sure that it would just go back to defaults, yeah. I'm sure those functions in xorg.conf are only used as parameters for custom bootup. Ubuntu installer can do stuff like this sometimes. :P
2008-09-11T05:12:00.000Z	AlNahar	slashjamiec	when you are prompted with "input not supported" should i be able to do something to get out of it?
2008-09-11T05:12:00.000Z	slashjamiec	AlNahar	Restart X maybe? Or revert to a terminal and edit xorg.conf (restarting X is simply ctrl+alt+backspace)
2008-09-11T05:22:00.000Z	AlNahar	slashjamiec	where is xorg.conf on ubuntu?
2008-09-11T05:23:00.000Z	slashjamiec	AlNahar	/etc/xorg.conf
2008-09-11T05:37:00.000Z	AlNahar	slashjamiec	i am trying to help someone with this problem, they said ls -la /etc/X11/xorg.conf says no such file
2008-09-11T05:48:00.000Z	AlNahar	slashjamiec	he can't get to X:)
