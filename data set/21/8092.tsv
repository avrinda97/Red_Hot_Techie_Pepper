2009-04-28T01:57:00.000Z	Led_Zeppelin		how do I configure X if I did an alternate disk install?
2009-04-28T01:58:00.000Z	dr_willis	Led_Zeppelin	 it shoud be identical to a desktop install method.
2009-04-28T01:58:00.000Z	Led_Zeppelin	dr_willis	using nvidia. Its not the identical.
2009-04-28T01:58:00.000Z	dr_willis	Led_Zeppelin	 ive done both.. it should be. You install the proper nvidia package from the repos.
2009-04-28T01:58:00.000Z	Led_Zeppelin	dr_willis	done. Then what?
2009-04-28T01:59:00.000Z	dr_willis	Led_Zeppelin	 alt cd here booted to X,  i ran the hardware-driver tool (or gksu jockey-gtk) let it install.. reboot...
2009-04-28T01:59:00.000Z	Led_Zeppelin	dr_willis	what?
2009-04-28T01:59:00.000Z	Led_Zeppelin	dr_willis	I am in CLI now
2009-04-28T01:59:00.000Z	dr_willis	Led_Zeppelin	 and what does 'startx' do?
2009-04-28T02:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	Led_Zeppelin	 you did not do a 'server' install?  instead of an alterantve-cd install did you?
2009-04-28T02:00:00.000Z	Led_Zeppelin	dr_willis	that should not matter. The packges should be able to configure.
2009-04-28T02:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	Led_Zeppelin	 for the most part they do.     ive deleted xorg.conf on systems befor and reran startx and it remade them
2009-04-28T02:01:00.000Z	Led_Zeppelin	dr_willis	its not remaking them for me..
2009-04-28T02:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	Led_Zeppelin	 so 'startx' does what exactly then? fails to load? gives an error? and yes a 'server' install can differ from a alt-install in this area.
2009-04-28T02:02:00.000Z	dr_willis	Led_Zeppelin	 and whats your video card?
2009-04-28T02:20:00.000Z	Led_Zeppelin	dr_willis	I did an aleternate install
2012-10-02T04:48:00.000Z	dr_willis	Led_Zeppelin	 you mean user programs when they login? or system services?
2012-10-02T04:48:00.000Z	Led_Zeppelin	dr_willis	system services.
2012-10-02T04:48:00.000Z	Led_Zeppelin	dr_willis	i will start with that.
2012-10-02T04:49:00.000Z	dr_willis	Led_Zeppelin	 No idea of any gui/tools - i just learn how upstart works. ;) -->  best guide ive seen --> http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/
2012-10-02T04:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	Led_Zeppelin	 unless you have a load of services installed, or a very old machine. i doubt if you will notice much improbement by disabling services
