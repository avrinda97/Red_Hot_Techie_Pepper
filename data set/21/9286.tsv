2006-01-07T11:40:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Jrex-Linux	No, no, I can do rocket science.
2006-01-07T11:41:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Jrex-Linux	Careful about telling things to die.  Might cause problems if they did.
2006-01-07T11:48:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Jrex-Linux	I took a lot more than an hour, but I did it without the friend.
2006-01-07T11:49:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Jrex-Linux	Google, and this channel.

2006-01-07T11:54:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Jrex-Linux	The Wiki saves us some breathe; ask about the parts you don't understand.
2006-01-07T11:56:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Jrex-Linux	Same here.
2006-01-07T11:56:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Jrex-Linux	btw, coming from Windows, the terminal concept kind of worried me too, but I've since gone the "Sweet, I can do that?!?" route with it.
