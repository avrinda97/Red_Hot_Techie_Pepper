2008-07-28T23:40:00.000Z	cygoku		Hi, when I load a Windows program under Wine, I am getting garbage on the screen making anything unusable,  It's as if the screen was split in half verticaly, both side showing the same stuff, but like I said with garbage (latest Wine), also, if I take a screenshot it's as if everything is normal.
