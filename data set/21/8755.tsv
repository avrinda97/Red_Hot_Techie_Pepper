2006-01-19T14:44:00.000Z	deefzi		anyone knows what the "Motif" is what opera is nagging about when i start it?
2006-01-19T14:45:00.000Z	Wibble-	deefzi	motif is a widget set (an old one) - like GTK and QT
2006-01-19T14:45:00.000Z	Wibble-	deefzi	install openmotif
2006-01-19T14:45:00.000Z	deefzi	Wibble-	ty.
2006-01-19T14:46:00.000Z	deefzi	Wibble-	do i need the whole openmotif, or is there some libraries that could be downloaded through apt?
2006-01-19T14:47:00.000Z	Wibble-		deejoe: thats a very good question - I had never realised that openmotif wasn't in apt!
2006-01-19T14:48:00.000Z	Wibble-		deejoe: looks like "lesstif" should be good enough?
2006-01-19T14:48:00.000Z	deefzi	Wibble-	wow. i stumbled upon the same page i was twenty minutes ago. boy how retarded is that you have to fill out some forms to have packages.
2006-01-19T14:49:00.000Z	deefzi	Wibble-	btw. deejoe would prolly appreciate if he wouldn't be bothered :D
2006-01-19T14:49:00.000Z	Wibble-	deefzi	oopsie :D
2006-01-19T14:50:00.000Z	Wibble-	deefzi	can ya let me know if it works please
2006-01-19T14:51:00.000Z	deefzi	Wibble-	yes. i'm still looking for a place to download the openmotif
2006-01-19T14:51:00.000Z	deefzi	Wibble-	or even better: find some useful packages from apt
2006-01-19T14:51:00.000Z	Wibble-	deefzi	I mean try lesstif2 from apt - I know openmotif would work
2006-01-19T14:52:00.000Z	Wibble-		lesstif2 is an implementation of motif which is in apt
2006-01-19T14:52:00.000Z	deefzi	Wibble-	this is like the retardest thing ever; you have register / fill license / whatever to get a piece of that software
2006-01-19T14:52:00.000Z	deefzi	Wibble-	oh. great. i typed lesstiff in apt-cache and got nothing. wonder why :)
2006-01-19T14:53:00.000Z	deefzi	Wibble-	my apt doesn't find it.
2006-01-19T14:53:00.000Z	Wibble-	deefzi	oh - well, if its not in there, it might be in one of the extra sources I've got lol
2006-01-19T14:53:00.000Z	deefzi	Wibble-	it gives only libxt6 which i already have.
2006-01-19T14:53:00.000Z	deefzi	Wibble-	might be. i have extra resources for some other packages too. can you give me urls?
