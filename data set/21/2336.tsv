2011-04-28T20:01:00.000Z	Holek		is there a configuration backup for compiz after upgrade?
2011-04-28T20:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Holek	how do you mean?
2011-04-28T20:03:00.000Z	Holek	ActionParsnip	I had my configured Compiz and with the upgrade Ubuntu basically trashed all the configuration I had
2011-04-28T20:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Holek	then use your own backups, or just resetup the WM
2011-04-28T20:09:00.000Z	Holek	ActionParsnip	the thing is, I didn't do any, and with any other configuration file it always asked me if I'm okay with changes being made...
2011-04-28T20:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Holek	then all I can sugest is you reset it up, I also suggest you review your backup regime to include the compiz settings
2011-04-28T20:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Holek	emerald is no longer maintained
2011-04-28T20:13:00.000Z	Holek	ActionParsnip	so, where can I change current window decorator options?
2011-04-28T20:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Holek	ccsm or simple-ccsm
2011-04-28T20:17:00.000Z	Holek	ActionParsnip	LAcan: okay, but ccsm doesn't give me themes, and desktop preferences give me just preloaded themes with no configuration options
2011-04-28T20:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Holek	not sure about "themes" it usually uses the GTK theme you set
2011-04-28T20:36:00.000Z	Holek	ActionParsnip	okay, now that I disabled metacity, it looks better
2011-04-28T20:37:00.000Z	Holek	ActionParsnip	but still doesn't give me any way to customize it
2011-04-28T20:41:00.000Z	Holek	ActionParsnip	that's the level of configuration I'm looking for: http://imgur.com/O4HGK
2011-04-28T20:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Holek	then install emerald and run:   emerald --replace
2011-04-28T20:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Holek	I don't theme much, it really doesn't interest me so you are asking the wrong guy
2011-04-28T20:42:00.000Z	Holek	ActionParsnip	and that brings me to my first sentence: emerald gives me segfault
2011-04-28T20:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Holek	try renaming the folder holding the emerald config
2011-04-28T20:45:00.000Z	Holek	ActionParsnip	$ emerald --replace
2011-04-28T20:45:00.000Z	Holek	ActionParsnip	so, no effectr
2011-04-28T20:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Holek	try the emerald irc channel (if they have one), or ask in #compiz
