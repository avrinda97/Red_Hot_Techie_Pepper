2009-07-09T19:43:00.000Z	its_me1897	usr13	Thanks for reply, how to use MAC filter?
2009-07-09T19:43:00.000Z	usr13	its_me1897	On the router / AP, use MAC filtering.
2009-07-09T19:44:00.000Z	usr13	its_me1897	WHat kind of router do you use?
2009-07-09T19:44:00.000Z	its_me1897	usr13	I am using an ZTE Modem.
2009-07-09T19:46:00.000Z	usr13	its_me1897	 I don't know about ZTE modem, refer to manual.
2009-07-09T19:47:00.000Z	its_me1897	usr13	Is thier something that we can do that does't involves Modem?
2009-07-09T19:48:00.000Z	usr13	its_me1897	We would need to know more about your LAN.
2009-07-09T19:48:00.000Z	usr13	its_me1897	On the server itself?  What exactly do you need to do?  Restirct it from all traffic?
2009-07-09T19:50:00.000Z	its_me1897	usr13	I don't have a LAN connection, I want to Restrict one of my user from accessing Internet?
2009-07-09T19:51:00.000Z	usr13	its_me1897	THat  will need to done on the router / modem.
2009-07-09T19:52:00.000Z	usr13	its_me1897	I am assuming the modem is also a router?  Or do you have a separate router?
2009-07-09T19:52:00.000Z	its_me1897	usr13	No, I have only a single Modem.
2009-07-09T19:53:00.000Z	usr13	its_me1897	and that modem also acts as router for the LAN?
2009-07-09T19:54:00.000Z	usr13	its_me1897	You need to give a detailed discription of your LAN.
2009-07-09T19:55:00.000Z	usr13	its_me1897	If you can ssh into the PC in question, you could do it there....
2009-07-09T19:55:00.000Z	its_me1897	usr13	ok
2009-07-09T19:57:00.000Z	usr13	its_me1897	If you ssh into the machine in question and add ifdown eth0 to /etc/rc.local and then issucommand eth0 down that would block  it from network connection, (if eth0 is the NIC that is connected).
2009-07-09T19:58:00.000Z	its_me1897	usr13	Where do I specify which user to block from accessing Internet connection?
2009-07-09T20:02:00.000Z	usr13	its_me1897	Oh you are talking about a user on the same machine? If so;  mezquitale has a good possible solution.
