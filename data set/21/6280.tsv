2008-08-30T20:48:00.000Z	arcade		Got a problem with an HP Omnibook 6100 (my good old laptop) and newer Ubuntu releases.  It freezes or reboots (either or) with newer kernels.  Worked nice up until 6.10 (I think), 7.04, 7.10 and 8.04 causes hang/reboot during bootup.  Bug 89892 seems to be the one hitting me (and others)
2008-08-30T20:48:00.000Z	arcade		And for some reason it's marked 'wontfix'. :-/
2008-08-30T20:50:00.000Z	Gnea	arcade	does this happen only with 8.04?
2008-08-30T20:51:00.000Z	Gnea	arcade	er, sorry, i mis-read the problem. have you tried any kernel switches?
2008-08-30T20:51:00.000Z	arcade	Gnea	Nah, 7.04 and 7.10 too.
2008-08-30T20:51:00.000Z	arcade	Gnea	noacpi and so forth has been tried.
2008-08-30T20:51:00.000Z	arcade	Gnea	No joy, though.
2008-08-30T20:52:00.000Z	Gnea	arcade	i'm not familiar with the "so forth" switch. :) could you please elaborate?
2008-08-30T20:52:00.000Z	arcade	Gnea	Hmm.  *tries to remember*.  noapic?
2008-08-30T20:53:00.000Z	Gnea	arcade	no sure if turning off APIC would help... have you tried re-routing interrupts?
2008-08-30T20:53:00.000Z	arcade	Gnea	Nope.
2008-08-30T20:53:00.000Z	arcade	Gnea	not familiar with rereouting interrupts.
2008-08-30T20:53:00.000Z	Gnea	arcade	okay - keeping APIC on is usually a good thing. pci=routeirq  usually takes care of hangs/lockups
2008-08-30T20:54:00.000Z	arcade	Gnea	According to the bugreport that others have filed, some have had success removing / moving away the intel-rng.ko
2008-08-30T20:54:00.000Z	arcade	Gnea	But I had no joy with that. :-/
2008-08-30T20:54:00.000Z	Gnea	arcade	well, give this a shot and see what happens :)
2008-08-30T20:55:00.000Z	arcade	Gnea	I will as soon as it's finished with its current task.  :)
2008-08-30T20:55:00.000Z	Gnea	arcade	ok
2008-08-30T20:57:00.000Z	arcade	Gnea	Tad annoying that it's marked 'medium,nofix' though - with no proper resolution.  The bug, that is.
2008-08-30T20:58:00.000Z	Gnea	arcade	yeah, i'm looking at them right now
2008-08-30T21:00:00.000Z	Gnea	arcade	i'm guessing you have done this, but i'd rather not assume that you have: have you gone through HP's troubleshooting guide?
