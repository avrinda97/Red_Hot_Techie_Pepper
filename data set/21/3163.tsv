2011-05-25T07:13:00.000Z	ubuser		i jus dont want to run into any problems
2011-05-25T07:13:00.000Z	SuperFireLord42	ubuser	what processor does your computer have in it?
2011-05-25T07:14:00.000Z	SuperFireLord42	ubuser	you had to take out 3gb of ram?
2011-05-25T07:15:00.000Z	SuperFireLord42	ubuser	do you have an internet connection on the box so i can have you pastebin something?
2011-05-25T07:15:00.000Z	SuperFireLord42	ubuser	copy the results of this command to http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/ and give us the link it gives. run cat /proc/cpuinfo in the terminal
2011-05-25T07:18:00.000Z	SuperFireLord42	ubuser	the paste didnt work right, its blank :/
2011-05-25T07:19:00.000Z	SuperFireLord42	ubuser	go with 64, dont worry about the paste
2011-05-25T07:21:00.000Z	SuperFireLord42	ubuser	for that use lspci (and please use pastebin.ubuntu.com)
2011-05-25T07:22:00.000Z	SuperFireLord42	ubuser	well, unless you only paste that one line, in which case put it right here
2011-05-25T07:26:00.000Z	SuperFireLord42	ubuser	how far will it boot with all the ram in? it could have to do with the old version of linux not supporting it
2011-05-25T07:27:00.000Z	SuperFireLord42	ubuser	thats a reset, how long did you have the jumper in the reset position?
2011-05-25T07:28:00.000Z	SuperFireLord42	ubuser	good, i recommend you may want to reflash your bios (not reset)
2011-05-25T07:28:00.000Z	SuperFireLord42	ubuser	pull up your computer online and find the newest bios for it and follow the instructions in general
2011-05-25T07:30:00.000Z	SuperFireLord42	ubuser	i would reset to factory in bios at the very least, it may fix it
2011-05-25T07:34:00.000Z	SuperFireLord42	ubuser	uh... svn? isnt that a subversion tool?
2011-05-25T07:35:00.000Z	SuperFireLord42	ubuser	can you burn the 11.04 cd?
2011-05-25T07:36:00.000Z	SuperFireLord42	ubuser	Dommer a bit
