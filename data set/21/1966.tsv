2010-03-05T08:16:00.000Z	Parogar		can anyone please help me, I kinda screwed my PC up installing ubuntu'
2010-03-05T08:17:00.000Z	Parogar		I am taking an OS class in school, so I downloaded ubuntu, installed it on a spare partition, and everything worked fine. the only problem, is that now my windows 7 is dead. Says Hal.dll is corrupte
2010-03-05T08:17:00.000Z	Parogar		corrupted*
2010-03-05T08:18:00.000Z	Srayahu	Parogar	you might also ask in #Linux and #Windows
2010-03-05T08:18:00.000Z	Srayahu	Parogar	Nah, it's not. So you installed Ubuntu and it boots?
2010-03-05T08:21:00.000Z	Srayahu	Parogar	unfortunately I don't use Windows. (At all) =( So I don't know what to suggest about a broken .dll (which is a windows file)
2010-03-05T08:21:00.000Z	Srayahu	Parogar	therein lies the issue - I don't know what I'm talking about concerning Windows.
2010-03-05T08:22:00.000Z	Srayahu	Parogar	it most likely did not.
2010-03-05T08:22:00.000Z	Srayahu	Parogar	give me a moment buddy. (Busy)
2010-03-05T08:23:00.000Z	Srayahu	Parogar	fail - Linux plays many of the games available on Windows. Including DirectX games.
2010-03-05T08:24:00.000Z	Srayahu	Parogar	because you lack the skill to optimize a Linux machine to run said games. I game happily in Linux.
2010-03-05T08:25:00.000Z	Srayahu	Parogar	I don't play Bad Company, but give me a disc and some time and I'll get 'er running.
2010-03-05T08:25:00.000Z	Srayahu	Parogar	How so?
2010-03-05T08:26:00.000Z	Srayahu	Parogar	understandable - now, if you need help I am more than willing to assist you. I do feel bad that your first  Linux experience is turning out to be a bad one.
2010-03-05T08:28:00.000Z	Srayahu	Parogar	I don't know what to suggest concerning your .dll. However, if you do have to reinstall across the whole machine then make sure you install Windows and then Linux. Windows likes to take over the whole MBR...
2010-03-05T08:28:00.000Z	Srayahu	Parogar	really, #Windows is the best place to ask concerning your .dll. We can't offer support for that here.
2010-03-05T08:29:00.000Z	Srayahu	Parogar	Wubi installs are... *cries*
2010-03-05T08:31:00.000Z	Srayahu	Parogar	ext4 is the file system you're thinking of. Did you do a manual partition scheme or a guided scheme?
2010-03-05T08:32:00.000Z	Srayahu	Parogar	Well, possibly
2010-03-05T08:35:00.000Z	Srayahu	Parogar	concerning installing windows/ubuntu. Unless you know what you're doing I'd recommend just doing a guided install. I know what I'm doing and I usually just do a guided install anyway when I do dual installations, etc.
2010-03-05T08:35:00.000Z	Srayahu	Parogar	you're using gcc?
