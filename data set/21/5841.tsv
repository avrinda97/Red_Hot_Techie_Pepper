2007-07-24T14:16:00.000Z	aztracker1	DRuNKeN-MAsTEr	you install vmware on your host OS (presuming ubuntu)... after that, you create a virtual machine to run your guest OS...
2007-07-24T14:30:00.000Z	aztracker1	DRuNKeN-MAsTEr	think of vmware as a program that runs in the host (Ubuntu), inside of vmware runs a virtual computer (with windows, or whatever)... one runs inside the other.
2007-07-24T14:31:00.000Z	aztracker1	DRuNKeN-MAsTEr	with vmware you dedicate a certain amount of memory to the guest... you could give 512 to the guest windows, then will have 512 for the host..
2007-07-24T14:31:00.000Z	aztracker1	DRuNKeN-MAsTEr	I'd recommend 2gb, so you can give windows at least 768mb.. (if xp)
2007-07-24T14:32:00.000Z	DRuNKeN-MAsTEr	aztracker1	i will need to get me another stick eventaully
2007-07-24T14:33:00.000Z	aztracker1	DRuNKeN-MAsTEr	try it giving 512mb to the guest, shouldn't run too bad.. also, no heavy gaming on windows under vmware..
2007-07-24T14:34:00.000Z	aztracker1	DRuNKeN-MAsTEr	me either really... waiting on 7.10 so I can have sound on my laptop...
2007-07-24T14:37:00.000Z	DRuNKeN-MAsTEr	aztracker1	7.10 Ubuntu?
2007-07-24T14:38:00.000Z	aztracker1	DRuNKeN-MAsTEr	it'll be the next release, around october..
2007-07-24T14:38:00.000Z	aztracker1	DRuNKeN-MAsTEr	basically... 7.04 was released in April of 2007... '07.04
2007-07-24T14:39:00.000Z	aztracker1	DRuNKeN-MAsTEr	I haven't had issues going from 6.04-6.10-7.04 so it should go smooth.
2007-07-24T14:43:00.000Z	DRuNKeN-MAsTEr	aztracker1	do you know if there is a support for apps in ubuntu that do the same job like windows apps to rip movies convert them etc,etc...
2007-07-24T14:44:00.000Z	aztracker1	DRuNKeN-MAsTEr	they're out there... xDVDRip is one...
2007-07-24T14:44:00.000Z	aztracker1	DRuNKeN-MAsTEr	there are evil scripts/packages for ubuntu that will install all the stuff for you..
